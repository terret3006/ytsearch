109.2 --> 116.71900000000001
gone away

114.079 --> 118.479
it's not as cloudy as it was yesterday

116.719 --> 121.67999999999999
it hasn't been raining

118.479 --> 123.439
too much did yesterday night but

121.68 --> 125.36000000000001
like even late in the night and it was

123.439 --> 128.56
up very late

125.36 --> 131.12
it yeah it didn't didn't really

128.56 --> 134.08
rain when it was late and it was pretty

131.12 --> 136.8
shiny and sunny in the morning

134.08 --> 138.48000000000002
but yeah right now it's kind of clouding

136.8 --> 141.52
up

138.48 --> 144.319
some this sounds like a familiar pattern

141.52 --> 147.36
like in morning sun and then as soon as

144.319 --> 150.48
the afternoon really starts

147.36 --> 156.959
yeah it goes away

150.48 --> 159.76
anyway i got green tea with me

156.959 --> 162.16
let's use in chat so far good servant

159.76 --> 164.79999999999998
was first and julio pepin

162.16 --> 164.79999999999998
good morning

165.84 --> 173.36
yeah again it's saturday

170.16 --> 175.519
at a very late friday very late i should

173.36 --> 180.31900000000002
really stop doing that

175.519 --> 180.31900000000002
hey dank good to see you

183.12 --> 189.59900000000002
uh yeah flatters debate was

186.319 --> 192.319
was okay but uh yeah i was

189.599 --> 195.28
not very present most of it especially i

192.319 --> 198.23899999999998
think i missed most of the after show

195.28 --> 200.08
or even maybe i missed it entirely i

198.239 --> 203.84
don't remember exactly

200.08 --> 207.59900000000002
but did hang around after that

203.84 --> 209.92000000000002
uh and owen benjamin was live and it was

207.599 --> 209.92
pretty

210.84 --> 215.28
interesting

212.64 --> 216.07999999999998
this guy on called razor fist who's

215.28 --> 219.84
apparently now

216.08 --> 223.519
part of their platform

219.84 --> 227.68
but yeah he was like had a lot of energy

223.519 --> 231.12
and wasn't entirely perfect

227.68 --> 233.68
very promising so it get it and

231.12 --> 234.56
yeah eventually like things started

233.68 --> 236.239
cutting out

234.56 --> 239.76
skype started cutting out again like

236.239 --> 242.4
seriously there's this issue

239.76 --> 244.07999999999998
and it's not just big of a yeah not just

242.4 --> 247.439
own benjamin streams it seems like all

244.08 --> 250.48000000000002
these platforms have like this

247.439 --> 251.12
stalling button that then sometimes seem

250.48 --> 255.439
to be

251.12 --> 257.919
pushed people call it getting grabbled

255.439 --> 260.799
but i wonder really if there is such a

257.919 --> 263.59999999999997
mechanism where they can just

260.799 --> 268.32
cause unnecessary delays to hold

263.6 --> 271.44
everything up

268.32 --> 274.0
because sometimes it really does happen

271.44 --> 275.04
and periodically though it doesn't

274.0 --> 277.199
always happen

275.04 --> 279.84000000000003
but that just makes me feel like it's

277.199 --> 283.91900000000004
being directed by somebody's mood

279.84 --> 288.08
see because moods are also periodically

283.919 --> 290.32
tyrannical moods come in waves yeah

288.08 --> 290.32
so

291.199 --> 298.24
oh yeah and

294.72 --> 301.759
tony dickinson's shabbat shalom

298.24 --> 311.84000000000003
hello and julio pepin check my paper oh

301.759 --> 311.84000000000003
i will

320.4 --> 325.84
ah okay

327.28 --> 330.55999999999995
well yeah

330.88 --> 339.84
that should do it i think

334.639 --> 344.0
damn dude julia pablo man

339.84 --> 344.0
that's i'm

344.08 --> 352.08
i'm a little overwhelmed that's a lot

348.56 --> 355.199
that's yeah

352.08 --> 358.479
that will definitely even out

355.199 --> 361.52000000000004
some of the situations that i

358.479 --> 364.88
had yeah the payoffs and [ __ ] that's

361.52 --> 367.84
going to help thank you so much julio

364.88 --> 367.84
cabin that's amazing

368.56 --> 371.919
i take it you're doing well

376.88 --> 381.28
yeah i need to recover from that that

379.36 --> 384.639
was a lot

381.28 --> 384.63899999999995
even for julio pavin

399.84 --> 405.919
like yeah that was like on the level of

403.84 --> 410.4
uh

405.919 --> 414.56
of sam last donation

410.4 --> 417.52
remember that that was also massive

414.56 --> 419.759
this is yeah to that level thank you so

417.52 --> 419.75899999999996
much

421.44 --> 428.479
you put in a lot of work

424.639 --> 431.12
i wonder if i do well yeah

428.479 --> 432.15999999999997
look what i'm doing again see this is

431.12 --> 435.919
what hap

432.16 --> 436.40000000000003
what the that's typically what happens

435.919 --> 439.75899999999996
when i

436.4 --> 440.479
get a little shocked i start to downplay

439.759 --> 443.52000000000004
things now i

440.479 --> 445.919
i guess i do do a lot of work but

443.52 --> 447.68
it's very weird to be me in that sense

445.919 --> 452.31899999999996
because

447.68 --> 454.639
how my how am i how i do it

452.319 --> 456.40000000000003
is by like an oscillation i put in

454.639 --> 458.479
oscillation in my life i guess that's

456.4 --> 461.919
typically work rhythm

458.479 --> 465.599
and i really aim the peak for the show

461.919 --> 468.31899999999996
a lot and how it works is

465.599 --> 470.319
i just have a like a peak focus i really

468.319 --> 474.319
use this show to kind of like

470.319 --> 476.40000000000003
crunch myself that's why i kind of seem

474.319 --> 478.16
i have memory problems at first it's

476.4 --> 480.56
very weird how that works every time

478.16 --> 481.36
like every time i think back i need the

480.56 --> 483.039
notes

481.36 --> 484.40000000000003
and then even with the notes sometimes i

483.039 --> 487.84
just can't remember

484.4 --> 490.0
like what happened so i'm really trying

487.84 --> 491.039
to focus this typically also happened in

490.0 --> 493.599
school by the way

491.039 --> 496.4
i got to school very early worse when

493.599 --> 496.4
it's really early

496.479 --> 499.75899999999996
uh but then after a while i'm like i'm

499.44 --> 502.96
like

499.759 --> 504.8
finally there and then i go very

502.96 --> 506.79999999999995
then i can get very technical and that's

504.8 --> 508.40000000000003
usually like after an hour on the flat

506.8 --> 511.28000000000003
earth debates

508.4 --> 513.519
i can get very technical very focused

511.28 --> 516.64
and then afterward

513.519 --> 517.68
i usually kind of stick to joking and

516.64 --> 521.5989999999999
observation

517.68 --> 523.3599999999999
like my work is it really work it's

521.599 --> 527.519
commenting it's like trying to be

523.36 --> 530.24
productive commenter also help to place

527.519 --> 531.68
really good concise key words and

530.24 --> 535.04
phrases

531.68 --> 535.5999999999999
that even like the streamer wherever

535.04 --> 537.5999999999999
they may

535.6 --> 538.72
whatever they may be doing if it's

537.6 --> 540.64
really live

538.72 --> 542.1600000000001
that they can also like reflect it

540.64 --> 544.24
almost use it

542.16 --> 545.6
like as an extra cue card not that they

544.24 --> 548.88
have to read it out

545.6 --> 552.08
but they can use it to kind of anchor in

548.88 --> 554.32
a very complex idea very easily

552.08 --> 558.36
and that's yeah it's a hobby i've been

554.32 --> 561.2
doing this since 2005

558.36 --> 564.16
1516 a lot

561.2 --> 566.48
it's typically yeah and it's also i used

564.16 --> 568.24
to do that even in conversations

566.48 --> 569.9200000000001
and but then it's very interruptive

568.24 --> 571.92
because when you verbally speak out you

569.92 --> 573.04
break into the conversation or the train

571.92 --> 574.959
of thought of the other

573.04 --> 576.959
and in a chat it's like this unique

574.959 --> 577.76
opportunity where i can fully utilize

576.959 --> 581.1999999999999
this

577.76 --> 583.36
without interrupting the person but just

581.2 --> 585.6
giving something available

583.36 --> 586.399
it's it was a big revelation that the

585.6 --> 590.0
chat room

586.399 --> 592.32
system while watching something

590.0 --> 594.56
was it was something new so that's where

592.32 --> 598.0
i go to

594.56 --> 600.88
and then after that i really just

598.0 --> 601.44
kind of linger around i only observe and

600.88 --> 603.2
then have

601.44 --> 604.8000000000001
remote thoughts i don't even get

603.2 --> 606.24
technical anymore and that's also

604.8 --> 608.4799999999999
typical

606.24 --> 611.12
when i watch movies and that helps

608.48 --> 613.839
because it kind of forces me back

611.12 --> 616.0
into suspense of disbelief because when

613.839 --> 618.48
i'm too awake and i watch something

616.0 --> 620.72
i'm constantly latching on to everything

618.48 --> 620.72
so

621.04 --> 627.76
i've tried to really utilize

624.32 --> 628.5600000000001
the oscillation of my rhythm to my

627.76 --> 632.959
activities

628.56 --> 636.079
in an effective way

632.959 --> 638.4799999999999
so i guess that i do do something right

636.079 --> 640.4799999999999
but especially in the last phase when i

638.48 --> 642.16
just don't want to go to sleep i feel

640.48 --> 645.279
really stupid

642.16 --> 646.3199999999999
it sounds weird i feel really dumb and i

645.279 --> 648.64
know like yeah

646.32 --> 649.6
my shows are pretty good and [ __ ] but

648.64 --> 652.56
when i look at it

649.6 --> 655.0400000000001
right then usually i don't feel all that

652.56 --> 657.4399999999999
great about it

655.04 --> 659.519
because i don't know i'm focused on

657.44 --> 661.6
something that i'm not focused on during

659.519 --> 664.88
the show

661.6 --> 668.88
in that phase i'm like on another part

664.88 --> 675.8389999999999
or on another frequency of my entire

668.88 --> 675.8389999999999
set of frequencies it's yeah

676.64 --> 680.48
but it's weird that's why i sometimes

678.56 --> 683.68
say like no i'm stupid

680.48 --> 684.5600000000001
i'm useless i i barely do anything i

683.68 --> 687.04
feel

684.56 --> 688.0
like i'm really doing nothing but it's

687.04 --> 691.68
because i can't see

688.0 --> 691.68
it in that part of the face

693.04 --> 697.4399999999999
because when i really think about it

694.56 --> 698.88
carefully yeah i do a lot i do do things

697.44 --> 702.0
that are not that

698.88 --> 703.92
apparent that are not that obvious

702.0 --> 705.519
but that i have thought out very

703.92 --> 709.519
carefully i always do

705.519 --> 712.0
i can't help it i had to build my life

709.519 --> 714.079
and then i noticed that at some point i

712.0 --> 716.56
just refused to grow further it's like

714.079 --> 719.76
no it's too fast i get really

716.56 --> 722.8
stressed out so then

719.76 --> 725.68
i'm just trying to remain

722.8 --> 726.0
to get the stressed out out of the way

725.68 --> 729.12
to

726.0 --> 730.0
really have some very continual system

729.12 --> 734.639
like it's always the

730.0 --> 738.72
same almost yeah neurotically the same

734.639 --> 740.9590000000001
and then i start to basically observe

738.72 --> 742.639
almost from a third person perspective

740.959 --> 745.1199999999999
like what am i doing

742.639 --> 746.5600000000001
what am i typically feeling like where's

745.12 --> 748.5600000000001
that coming from

746.56 --> 750.16
where's the the minute frustrations

748.56 --> 752.079
coming from

750.16 --> 753.76
and then just like it's frustrations

752.079 --> 755.519
it's fresh it's always frustration in

753.76 --> 757.2
some way usually it's frustration that

755.519 --> 759.2
you have some kind of

757.2 --> 760.72
energy available in you and you don't

759.2 --> 762.24
really know what it's for you don't know

760.72 --> 764.8000000000001
what to do with it it's

762.24 --> 765.279
almost like a nuisance but it it's also

764.8 --> 767.279
you can

765.279 --> 768.72
feel that it could do so it makes you

767.279 --> 769.92
want to do something

768.72 --> 772.0
and then if you don't know what to do

769.92 --> 774.399
with it you act out

772.0 --> 776.639
in some way and i figured out that i had

774.399 --> 778.8
a lot of these weird

776.639 --> 780.0790000000001
pretty unique impulses and when i was a

778.8 --> 783.519
kid i could really

780.079 --> 785.4399999999999
get super creative with it in the face

783.519 --> 786.32
of my parents and attain like pretty

785.44 --> 789.0400000000001
high level

786.32 --> 791.6
thinking when it was very little and

789.04 --> 795.279
these things have remained

791.6 --> 798.48
and now i just try to use them

795.279 --> 799.76
really like use these impulses like

798.48 --> 802.16
these sprites

799.76 --> 803.04
to just put them to a specific task that

802.16 --> 806.24
is in line

803.04 --> 807.4399999999999
with their power and that's what i've

806.24 --> 809.76
been doing

807.44 --> 813.12
and that's also why i keep feeling very

809.76 --> 816.0
good because i got most of these

813.12 --> 817.92
frustrations out of the way because the

816.0 --> 819.519
big frustration about energy pulses that

817.92 --> 822.079
you don't know what to do with it

819.519 --> 822.88
is that they feel wasted and then i feel

822.079 --> 824.8
wasted

822.88 --> 826.8
i feel like i'm wasting my time when

824.8 --> 830.4799999999999
that happens

826.8 --> 830.4799999999999
but when i managed to get them

830.72 --> 833.839
get yeah like squish them really use

833.519 --> 837.279
them

833.839 --> 838.5600000000001
and yeah not just throw it out or try to

837.279 --> 840.72
keep it out

838.56 --> 841.68
then suddenly yeah it it gives some

840.72 --> 844.24
purpose

841.68 --> 847.04
it's yeah it was very ethereal the way

844.24 --> 847.04
i'm explaining it

847.76 --> 858.8
very very esoteric right

856.32 --> 859.6
julia babin not only do you put in a lot

858.8 --> 862.24
of work for

859.6 --> 864.16
us flat earthers i do my best but you

862.24 --> 865.6800000000001
also have god on your side and you speak

864.16 --> 868.3199999999999
highly of him

865.68 --> 869.5999999999999
and know that this is his creation and

868.32 --> 873.36
not just some

869.6 --> 876.24
coincidence yes

873.36 --> 877.1990000000001
well the more you see the more you just

876.24 --> 879.839
can't avoid that

877.199 --> 881.68
really you have to have you have to get

879.839 --> 884.32
very creative

881.68 --> 886.3199999999999
with your cognate cognition system

884.32 --> 889.7600000000001
suspense of disbelief to keep

886.32 --> 894.1600000000001
god out of that but as to what he

889.76 --> 896.48
is i pretty much go by the spirit of god

894.16 --> 898.16
not really focusing him on as an

896.48 --> 901.36
individual thinker

898.16 --> 902.3199999999999
because yeah it's never going to work

901.36 --> 904.399
out

902.32 --> 906.32
like that the personification to that

904.399 --> 909.519
level is not my thing

906.32 --> 913.12
never really was because it's too big

909.519 --> 913.839
to be a person like i i can't imagine

913.12 --> 917.12
that

913.839 --> 918.24
like also yeah it's there's how do you

917.12 --> 921.519
call that

918.24 --> 924.639
would be i'm just going by

921.519 --> 927.04
the feeling of a cons yeah of a law

924.639 --> 928.48
the inverse square law with light right

927.04 --> 932.0
over distance

928.48 --> 932.72
well a similar effect is with power and

932.0 --> 934.88
grip

932.72 --> 937.36
and control over the situation if you

934.88 --> 941.04
have like unlimited energy

937.36 --> 943.12
then the e yet they say that god has no

941.04 --> 946.56
ego right

943.12 --> 950.48
what what if his ego is the devil

946.56 --> 955.8389999999999
literally oh jesus yeah

950.48 --> 955.839
then there is like a problem

956.72 --> 964.5600000000001
so i and i fear it i fear it i fear god

961.04 --> 967.12
i fear god a lot because

964.56 --> 968.0
all powerful and i just can't avoid that

967.12 --> 971.759
that means that if

968.0 --> 973.44
there is like a devil personified

971.759 --> 975.519
it's also coming from him and if there

973.44 --> 978.72
is a spirit of satan

975.519 --> 981.839
that people fall into when they give up

978.72 --> 983.9200000000001
hope and they just go on autopilot then

981.839 --> 985.44
that is also a natural consequence of

983.92 --> 988.56
the design of it all

985.44 --> 989.1990000000001
to me and that makes it also directed by

988.56 --> 992.7199999999999
god

989.199 --> 994.0
whether it's a real individual mentally

992.72 --> 996.639
interfacing

994.0 --> 999.279
or whether it is just an auto pilot

996.639 --> 999.279
mechanism

1000.16 --> 1005.6
so yeah all in all i but i i direct that

1003.519 --> 1008.88
fear against god not against

1005.6 --> 1011.12
the evil or the devil because

1008.88 --> 1014.079
i find the evil and the devil actually

1011.12 --> 1014.079
more predictable

1014.88 --> 1023.12
and that makes them avoidable

1018.16 --> 1023.12
god not so avoidable

1023.44 --> 1027.6000000000001
that's also the biggest problem for the

1025.76 --> 1029.36
satanist and that's why they continually

1027.6 --> 1032.3999999999999
get punished

1029.36 --> 1033.4389999999999
because they're trying to avoid him just

1032.4 --> 1036.88
like

1033.439 --> 1039.199
when i act out when i try to avoid

1036.88 --> 1040.48
these energy sprites as they call them

1039.199 --> 1043.199
or you could say it's

1040.48 --> 1044.88
it's god it's god putting on a specific

1043.199 --> 1047.679
frequency task for me

1044.88 --> 1050.3190000000002
giving this energy but a sprite i don't

1047.679 --> 1050.3190000000002
know it's just

1050.32 --> 1056.72
in my esoteric

1053.6 --> 1059.9189999999999
view the way it is physically kind of

1056.72 --> 1061.28
reflected because yeah energies are

1059.919 --> 1063.039
sometimes visually

1061.28 --> 1064.72
represented it's like an extra

1063.039 --> 1067.84
projection that happens i'm

1064.72 --> 1070.32
my mind constructed this i think

1067.84 --> 1071.28
and then when i focus in on the energy i

1070.32 --> 1075.2
start to see

1071.28 --> 1077.6
a correlating thing

1075.2 --> 1080.48
but i'm very very well aware that is

1077.6 --> 1084.08
actually my imagination being projected

1080.48 --> 1087.28
over my actual site when that happens

1084.08 --> 1090.799
yeah but it is

1087.28 --> 1092.96
palpable and interactive

1090.799 --> 1094.0
that makes it more real than it is is

1092.96 --> 1096.24
just a random

1094.0 --> 1097.039
imagination because when you look at

1096.24 --> 1099.039
that you

1097.039 --> 1100.96
you've always look away from the

1099.039 --> 1101.6
physical reality that doesn't happen in

1100.96 --> 1105.28
this case

1101.6 --> 1109.76
yeah it's pretty complex mechanism

1105.28 --> 1113.6789999999999
with visualization

1109.76 --> 1115.919
but yeah when you ignore the sprites

1113.679 --> 1117.2800000000002
just like when you would ignore the laws

1115.919 --> 1120.3200000000002
of god

1117.28 --> 1123.52
it reacts anyway and then yeah

1120.32 --> 1127.6
deflecting the sprite energy makes you

1123.52 --> 1131.2
act out deflecting god god's

1127.6 --> 1134.24
rules brings the outside world

1131.2 --> 1136.32
to you in some way or gives you

1134.24 --> 1137.2
basically gives you the consequences of

1136.32 --> 1141.4399999999998
what you've done

1137.2 --> 1144.0800000000002
to yourself and then creation

1141.44 --> 1145.52
punishes you because of it punishes you

1144.08 --> 1147.6789999999999
or gives you the result

1145.52 --> 1151.84
the natural results see it's a matter of

1147.679 --> 1151.8400000000001
perspective with that

1160.08 --> 1166.96
what missed you at v h

1163.6 --> 1179.84
c v h c what

1166.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
what is that

1180.559 --> 1184.32
and yeah anthony dickinson i

1185.28 --> 1190.24
i don't know what vhc stands for

1190.84 --> 1193.84
sorry

1197.52 --> 1201.039
hey unbelievable productions by the way

1200.32 --> 1207.84
good

1201.039 --> 1207.84
to see you in chat

1233.919 --> 1237.679
god is the dungeon master of the

1235.84 --> 1242.9599999999998
universe

1237.679 --> 1242.96
well it is definitely of this realm

1246.96 --> 1250.96
but i don't you know that's kind of how

1249.6 --> 1254.48
i see it

1250.96 --> 1258.0
i think god is the master

1254.48 --> 1262.64
of earth like that everything about it

1258.0 --> 1264.4
and its design but the spirits

1262.64 --> 1266.88
like and the spirit frequencies that

1264.4 --> 1270.0800000000002
exist i don't know if he

1266.88 --> 1272.88
controls that you know that part

1270.08 --> 1274.24
might be almost like his ego like all

1272.88 --> 1277.2
these

1274.24 --> 1277.76
weird alien spirits or reptilian spirits

1277.2 --> 1281.1200000000001
or

1277.76 --> 1283.36
all the the darkness like

1281.12 --> 1284.799
it does exist like it has its own

1283.36 --> 1289.1999999999998
workings and logic

1284.799 --> 1292.72
outside of normal physical reality

1289.2 --> 1295.76
in the other dimensions oh it exists

1292.72 --> 1299.6000000000001
does god does the creator

1295.76 --> 1304.72
does christ have domain over it

1299.6 --> 1309.28
if so why would it all persist

1304.72 --> 1309.28
why would he let that see it

1310.0 --> 1316.08
it is really common like a game master

1313.2 --> 1318.24
it's so it's so much is like to me like

1316.08 --> 1320.24
god is a game master because

1318.24 --> 1322.64
i think that the whole design is really

1320.24 --> 1326.88
all about the challenges

1322.64 --> 1329.8400000000001
i that is like the thing god is doing

1326.88 --> 1332.159
is mainly is to design everything to

1329.84 --> 1334.8799999999999
make it as a great a story as

1332.159 --> 1336.4
conceivable for those who have eyes to

1334.88 --> 1340.159
see

1336.4 --> 1340.159
to understand that it is

1341.919 --> 1345.5200000000002
and that's kind of what i do as a game

1344.32 --> 1348.72
master

1345.52 --> 1351.2
so yeah that doesn't mean that i'm god

1348.72 --> 1352.48
of course i'm not going to get all

1351.2 --> 1356.32
entangled with that or

1352.48 --> 1358.72
my macro cosmos micro cosmos

1356.32 --> 1360.799
but maybe in a way we are then in a

1358.72 --> 1361.84
sense a reflection of the creator or

1360.799 --> 1364.48
some of us

1361.84 --> 1365.84
are spirits it's that it's part of what

1364.48 --> 1368.88
we can become

1365.84 --> 1371.039
not that we become the him

1368.88 --> 1372.0
or the the caretaker of the realm

1371.039 --> 1376.08
literally

1372.0 --> 1376.08
but we literally become reflections

1376.32 --> 1382.559
within our own limits like that

1379.6 --> 1382.559
more more like that

1387.28 --> 1391.12
stallion 8012 blue

1400.84 --> 1403.84
right

1404.799 --> 1412.559
oh man yeah by the way also in my notes

1409.44 --> 1415.8400000000001
was another red pill rooster the

1412.559 --> 1417.2
journey to the antarctic did you guys

1415.84 --> 1420.559
any of you guys see that

1417.2 --> 1421.279
that was pretty that was like pretty

1420.559 --> 1423.039
amazing

1421.279 --> 1424.32
it's almost like yeah they showed it

1423.039 --> 1426.32
like a video and

1424.32 --> 1427.84
i'm in chat like where can i freaking

1426.32 --> 1430.3999999999999
play this

1427.84 --> 1431.12
this looks amazing it's like a web game

1430.4 --> 1433.1200000000001
thing

1431.12 --> 1434.799
i would find on new grounds or something

1433.12 --> 1436.9599999999998
it's like

1434.799 --> 1439.6
really compelling like why isn't this

1436.96 --> 1439.6000000000001
game real

1441.679 --> 1447.76
and it was hilarious

1445.52 --> 1448.799
that new grounds probably wouldn't take

1447.76 --> 1451.84
it

1448.799 --> 1453.76
because it wasn't probably nah that's

1451.84 --> 1459.84
ridiculous they are all over the place

1453.76 --> 1459.84
they would probably take it

1463.12 --> 1473.52
we and divine beings are not robots

1467.76 --> 1475.679
chemical reactions in our brain no

1473.52 --> 1478.0
i think the chemical reactions in our

1475.679 --> 1478.0
brain

1478.32 --> 1485.2
connects our

1482.0 --> 1486.08
experience to something ethereal but

1485.2 --> 1489.3600000000001
that is very

1486.08 --> 1492.3999999999999
real it's based in the energies it's

1489.36 --> 1495.4399999999998
part of what feeds everything like

1492.4 --> 1500.159
it's probably the electric ether

1495.44 --> 1503.3600000000001
and i think the electric ether just

1500.159 --> 1506.64
is to the spirit

1503.36 --> 1509.279
like other dimensions like

1506.64 --> 1512.48
places it's like the spirit might be

1509.279 --> 1515.679
able to write this ether

1512.48 --> 1517.6
in the other dimension yeah sounds very

1515.679 --> 1521.1200000000001
fantastical and it is and hey

1517.6 --> 1524.32
yeah i bet there's some

1521.12 --> 1525.6789999999999
psychotropic users that would agree to

1524.32 --> 1528.96
that

1525.679 --> 1542.0800000000002
they might yeah understand it a little

1528.96 --> 1546.559
now that i'm explaining it like this

1542.08 --> 1546.559
do angels have free will and autonomy

1548.559 --> 1551.84
you mean can they

1552.32 --> 1560.8799999999999
not away

1556.48 --> 1560.88
well they might be able to

1566.08 --> 1571.84
but the consequences you know

1586.799 --> 1592.96
i think from an angelic perspective

1589.84 --> 1593.9189999999999
it's literally insane to do that like

1592.96 --> 1597.3600000000001
it's better

1593.919 --> 1601.44
to just try to work with god

1597.36 --> 1605.039
and yeah so it must be like oppositional

1601.44 --> 1608.0
to light arrogance

1605.039 --> 1610.84
only that could lead you to rebel as an

1608.0 --> 1614.0
angel against god

1610.84 --> 1616.48
because yeah isn't god basically

1614.0 --> 1618.48
the designer of it all and everything so

1616.48 --> 1623.84
isn't it better to just

1618.48 --> 1626.96
try to relay your view or what you think

1623.84 --> 1629.12
would be better with god like even as a

1626.96 --> 1629.6000000000001
person as a human being i bet that

1629.12 --> 1631.84
people

1629.6 --> 1632.7199999999998
have think they have this interaction

1631.84 --> 1635.84
and god does

1632.72 --> 1636.96
listen to everything everything like

1635.84 --> 1639.4399999999998
even the

1636.96 --> 1640.48
silliest of people he does listen to

1639.44 --> 1642.3200000000002
them because

1640.48 --> 1644.24
even the silliest of people are part of

1642.32 --> 1648.08
the design he's probably studying

1644.24 --> 1650.3990000000001
everything that's happening as well

1648.08 --> 1652.0
and he should know but he's still

1650.399 --> 1655.1999999999998
studying it because

1652.0 --> 1658.24
there's constantly this this choice

1655.2 --> 1660.24
duality going on with everything

1658.24 --> 1661.84
that he doesn't have perfect control

1660.24 --> 1663.76
over so he's it's like an

1661.84 --> 1665.76
interactive design like that very much

1663.76 --> 1667.36
like d d by the way as a game master

1665.76 --> 1669.84
again

1667.36 --> 1670.799
you know a game master is almost like

1669.84 --> 1674.0
writing a book

1670.799 --> 1676.799
but you have to let people

1674.0 --> 1678.08
make choices within and then adapt you

1676.799 --> 1681.12
must

1678.08 --> 1682.08
as a game master it's not like a book

1681.12 --> 1685.1999999999998
and you can always

1682.08 --> 1687.36
oh it's going to be this always and no

1685.2 --> 1690.48
because your players can just

1687.36 --> 1692.399
conjure up new concepts and even

1690.48 --> 1694.159
draw away your attention from your

1692.399 --> 1697.6789999999999
original plan

1694.159 --> 1700.64
to something that is just has

1697.679 --> 1701.1200000000001
the mystical quality to it that's just

1700.64 --> 1705.2
really

1701.12 --> 1705.1999999999998
inspiring and i think that

1705.919 --> 1712.0
maybe that is like the fashion in which

1708.84 --> 1715.4399999999998
god is trying to direct

1712.0 --> 1717.2
everyone and everything and so it would

1715.44 --> 1721.2
be just simpler to

1717.2 --> 1721.2
relay your ideas to god

1721.6 --> 1728.799
just open communication

1725.279 --> 1731.12
open with your heart and mind

1728.799 --> 1732.8799999999999
don't try to trick him that's ridiculous

1731.12 --> 1735.9189999999999
but to

1732.88 --> 1738.5590000000002
yeah to just relay why how

1735.919 --> 1740.0800000000002
and then like a judge he will just think

1738.559 --> 1742.6399999999999
about it

1740.08 --> 1743.6789999999999
and maybe he will adapt he's not

1742.64 --> 1746.64
guaranteed to

1743.679 --> 1747.1200000000001
only if it makes sense you know because

1746.64 --> 1749.039
it's

1747.12 --> 1750.799
very likely that most people will

1749.039 --> 1752.96
conceive of something that they think

1750.799 --> 1756.96
will improve the world

1752.96 --> 1759.8400000000001
and it in it won't they just

1756.96 --> 1761.3600000000001
get more positive yeah more positive

1759.84 --> 1764.32
feeling healthy

1761.36 --> 1766.08
feel squirt out of it it doesn't

1764.32 --> 1768.799
actually effectively

1766.08 --> 1770.0
change things for the better that's what

1768.799 --> 1773.2
most people

1770.0 --> 1775.039
do you know that's what they think

1773.2 --> 1777.279
at first at least and then a lot of

1775.039 --> 1781.84
people hang on to that very long

1777.279 --> 1781.84
makes them look very immature

1782.159 --> 1788.0
right but if you got just really well

1785.6 --> 1791.52
thought out creative thinking

1788.0 --> 1795.36
then maybe he might listen or he might

1791.52 --> 1800.32
even communicate back to you and try to

1795.36 --> 1800.32
help you understand why your decent idea

1801.44 --> 1806.64
could still be improved

1804.64 --> 1808.7990000000002
because you can't really know everything

1806.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
because you're not god

1808.799 --> 1823.84
yeah see it

1853.919 --> 1857.76
humans like lucifer

1860.48 --> 1865.84
what you're saying lucifer is a human

1862.48 --> 1865.84
now really

1881.919 --> 1886.5590000000002
why are you getting this from haste and

1884.08 --> 1886.559
slowly

1887.84 --> 1892.1589999999999
have you been watching netflix or

1891.519 --> 1894.88
something

1892.159 --> 1894.88
i wouldn't know

1895.2 --> 1899.279
but i don't recognize this

1900.0 --> 1907.84
misconception about lucifer you're

1901.919 --> 1907.8400000000001
talking about

1908.35 --> 1911.7199999999998
[Music]

1914.33 --> 1917.4099999999999
[Music]

1932.84 --> 1937.279
so

1934.72 --> 1938.159
all right that's in that's interesting

1937.279 --> 1941.36
maggot brain

1938.159 --> 1941.919
about what you say with the game com the

1941.36 --> 1945.039
code

1941.919 --> 1946.88
the design it's the design right

1945.039 --> 1948.32
so god must have done the same with

1946.88 --> 1952.24
lucifer

1948.32 --> 1954.6399999999999
in a way it would have probably been

1952.24 --> 1956.559
almost like lucifer would have come to

1954.64 --> 1958.7990000000002
god and basically said

1956.559 --> 1960.6399999999999
i thought always that lucifer just like

1958.799 --> 1963.84
objected to

1960.64 --> 1965.039
the staleness of it all it's all too

1963.84 --> 1967.519
sterile it doesn't

1965.039 --> 1968.96
mean a lot like he there had to be

1967.519 --> 1972.799
opposition

1968.96 --> 1974.96
so he just agreed with god like okay

1972.799 --> 1977.84
we're going to make a mess of it okay

1974.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
god

1978.72 --> 1981.76
and then yeah

1982.159 --> 1991.6000000000001
we can we can yeah design

1985.36 --> 1993.279
something more interesting

1991.6 --> 1996.08
like could it be it could have been like

1993.279 --> 1998.0
that and that it would be logical that

1996.08 --> 1999.4399999999998
if they literally become like the

1998.0 --> 2001.6
opposition to god

1999.44 --> 2002.88
that whether they originally wanted it

2001.6 --> 2005.039
or not

2002.88 --> 2006.24
basically because they went outside of

2005.039 --> 2009.919
logos

2006.24 --> 2014.0
they would start to mentally degenerate

2009.919 --> 2017.039
and they would become demonic

2014.0 --> 2019.279
not because that was the original intent

2017.039 --> 2021.919
but because of the consequences of the

2019.279 --> 2021.919
agreement

2030.84 --> 2033.84
see

2042.32 --> 2049.12
that's lucifer i was actually enough

2046.72 --> 2049.12
dude

2053.04 --> 2060.159
oh my god look guys what if lucifer

2057.839 --> 2061.359
like i don't know a thousand years ago

2060.159 --> 2064.079
or more or whatever

2061.359 --> 2065.119
was just a common name it was like yeah

2064.079 --> 2069.119
lucifer and

2065.119 --> 2072.48
tom and and i don't know

2069.119 --> 2075.52
john and

2072.48 --> 2078.0
jesus might have been a comedy

2075.52 --> 2078.8
what if they weren't just common names

2078.0 --> 2082.8
and it's like it

2078.8 --> 2082.8
meant like yeah bright one or something

2085.359 --> 2090.399
so yeah oh there's we've got writing it

2088.56 --> 2092.24
was actually this guy

2090.399 --> 2094.399
he was just a human being or he was this

2092.24 --> 2097.04
nephilim yeah in another script

2094.399 --> 2099.04
and then all this like maybe it's

2097.04 --> 2103.359
because it was just a much more common

2099.04 --> 2105.52
name than you would realize

2103.359 --> 2106.96
sorry i'm not trying to be blasphemous

2105.52 --> 2117.839
here

2106.96 --> 2117.839
it's just that

2128.32 --> 2136.1600000000003
oh by the way thank you reggie benneke

2132.079 --> 2139.44
for the 21 czar

2136.16 --> 2139.44
what the hell was a czar

2141.44 --> 2145.119
but thank you for that i don't know what

2144.4 --> 2148.1600000000003
i got

2145.119 --> 2148.1600000000003
but i thank you for it

2150.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
hey nathan oakley

2175.68 --> 2181.52
all right more colored

2178.72 --> 2181.52
i didn't know that

2182.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
what is a czar i've never seen that

2197.119 --> 2201.04
walter russell's book i'm not familiar

2200.0 --> 2203.92
with the book

2201.04 --> 2205.2799999999997
i'm not familiar with a lot of book but

2203.92 --> 2210.7200000000003
walter russell

2205.28 --> 2210.7200000000003
the name does ring a bell did he do

2212.839 --> 2215.839
again

2219.44 --> 2227.52
no good servant the currency

2223.359 --> 2230.88
type czar south african rand

2227.52 --> 2233.599
okay okay ah south africa

2230.88 --> 2233.599
right thanks

2240.839 --> 2243.839
uh

2246.24 --> 2249.4399999999996
oh yeah i'm gonna look up

2250.0 --> 2271.839
walter russell wasn't it

2257.119 --> 2271.839
oh which one

2275.92 --> 2285.839
the universal one walter russell

2279.52 --> 2285.839
cosmology right do you mean that one

2287.52 --> 2290.32
oh wait

2290.96 --> 2295.04
wasn't he the guy that also had like

2293.2 --> 2297.68
these

2295.04 --> 2299.359
these supreme patterns as it were that

2297.68 --> 2301.04
would determine

2299.359 --> 2304.0789999999997
like how electricity and light and

2301.04 --> 2307.119
everything is like connected

2304.079 --> 2308.96
the guy that dejan came forward with

2307.119 --> 2312.56
it's been been a while it's like over a

2308.96 --> 2315.68
year ago i think

2312.56 --> 2318.0
yeah i have i think i have the pdf of

2315.68 --> 2321.9199999999996
that somewhere

2318.0 --> 2321.92
but it's that book just gives me a

2324.839 --> 2327.839
headache

2333.2 --> 2341.5989999999997
it's like over connected it doesn't lead

2335.52 --> 2343.68
to anything

2341.599 --> 2344.7200000000003
that's kind of what i got out of it like

2343.68 --> 2346.8799999999997
you can see

2344.72 --> 2348.0789999999997
it helps you almost see that all things

2346.88 --> 2350.48
are correlated like

2348.079 --> 2351.6800000000003
that there is a pattern to everything i

2350.48 --> 2354.8
even believed in that

2351.68 --> 2357.9199999999996
for a very long time since i was like

2354.8 --> 2359.92
15 now 16. the pattern

2357.92 --> 2361.359
the singular pattern that connects

2359.92 --> 2365.92
everything

2361.359 --> 2369.5989999999997
which would have to be god's pattern

2365.92 --> 2371.52
it's his design pattern is basically

2369.599 --> 2373.119
designed like that

2371.52 --> 2375.119
but i imagine that it would be a

2373.119 --> 2378.04
singular formula

2375.119 --> 2383.839
that would be unfathomable so i kind of

2378.04 --> 2383.839
mathematicalized it

2386.16 --> 2391.7599999999998
but yeah it helps to see you

2389.599 --> 2394.32
that there may just be a lot more

2391.76 --> 2397.92
connections than you would naturally

2394.32 --> 2400.96
have tendencies to think of

2397.92 --> 2404.96
and that way it's very interesting

2400.96 --> 2408.4
but as to literal concrete

2404.96 --> 2410.56
discoveries that it doesn't help you

2408.4 --> 2413.359
with a lot

2410.56 --> 2415.2
so it's almost like a reflector it's

2413.359 --> 2416.72
good to reflect upon it when you deal

2415.2 --> 2419.4399999999996
with things

2416.72 --> 2422.0789999999997
but it's not a good source to find a

2419.44 --> 2424.319
discovery of something

2422.079 --> 2427.119
it's a good thing to reflect upon and

2424.319 --> 2431.44
then discover

2427.119 --> 2435.119
some yeah discover in something else

2431.44 --> 2437.2000000000003
things that you haven't seen before

2435.119 --> 2439.839
something yeah that's kind of like how i

2437.2 --> 2439.839
would use it

2450.56 --> 2455.52
oh right anthony dickinson yeah you did

2452.88 --> 2455.52
that before

2458.48 --> 2464.4
but i don't think so i'm that's dude

2462.079 --> 2466.1600000000003
it's not gonna work like these people

2464.4 --> 2469.359
are so

2466.16 --> 2470.319
different in the way they approach it

2469.359 --> 2473.2
all

2470.319 --> 2473.68
they're so exoteric they are it's no

2473.2 --> 2476.24
it's not

2473.68 --> 2479.68
what uses it for me to go there and ask

2476.24 --> 2483.1189999999997
questions about my esoteric approach

2479.68 --> 2485.68
what they might have they might say like

2483.119 --> 2486.56
something interesting they find it

2485.68 --> 2488.64
interesting or

2486.56 --> 2491.359
maybe or maybe they'll disapprove that's

2488.64 --> 2494.0789999999997
it that's all i will get out of it

2491.359 --> 2495.04
because these people don't can't like

2494.079 --> 2498.2400000000002
build on that

2495.04 --> 2498.24
they're exoterrorists

2500.64 --> 2506.319
like really far exeter is very rusted

2504.0 --> 2506.319
very

2506.88 --> 2510.48
they follow the same train train of

2509.2 --> 2514.0789999999997
thoughts routes

2510.48 --> 2516.88
constantly their path

2514.079 --> 2518.6400000000003
it's like it's railroaded by themselves

2516.88 --> 2520.319
they correct they created their own

2518.64 --> 2523.1189999999997
railroad system

2520.319 --> 2523.7599999999998
mentally that that doesn't work for me

2523.119 --> 2525.92
at

2523.76 --> 2525.92
all

2526.8 --> 2530.88
i'm a free runner like that

2532.64 --> 2537.839
somebody's getting married again i guess

2549.04 --> 2553.2799999999997
but i don't have questions like that

2555.04 --> 2563.2799999999997
i don't need somebody else to answer me

2559.2 --> 2566.48
my questions i just had just have ideas

2563.28 --> 2567.52
and then i put them out there and all

2566.48 --> 2570.16
i'm

2567.52 --> 2570.88
i'm offering it i'm offering it to other

2570.16 --> 2573.92
people

2570.88 --> 2574.4
like is this good could you do something

2573.92 --> 2577.2000000000003
with this

2574.4 --> 2577.599
that's it that's pretty much what i do

2577.2 --> 2581.04
i'm

2577.599 --> 2584.6400000000003
i don't need to feel like oh i'm

2581.04 --> 2587.52
insecure whether what i thought

2584.64 --> 2589.359
is correct or something if that yeah if

2587.52 --> 2590.079
i feel like that i'll just throw it out

2589.359 --> 2593.7599999999998
there

2590.079 --> 2596.48
i'll just say it like do you guys agree

2593.76 --> 2598.0
if i think it is that there is that

2596.48 --> 2601.44
there are points of

2598.0 --> 2604.4
debate about it i'll do that

2601.44 --> 2604.96
but i don't need to go to other people

2604.4 --> 2609.2000000000003
and like

2604.96 --> 2610.4
ask them is satan a spirit or is it a

2609.2 --> 2613.9199999999996
person

2610.4 --> 2617.599
or is lucifer like a frequency

2613.92 --> 2621.04
or is it a like is he physically

2617.599 --> 2623.92
incarnated is he immortal or

2621.04 --> 2626.0
has he died is he only a spirit now like

2623.92 --> 2627.359
an angel but corrupted like all these

2626.0 --> 2630.56
things like

2627.359 --> 2632.24
what does it why would i need an answer

2630.56 --> 2636.0
to any of that

2632.24 --> 2639.04
when i face it whatever it may be

2636.0 --> 2641.04
in any form all that matters is that i

2639.04 --> 2644.24
recognize the frequency

2641.04 --> 2645.68
that i recognize this spirit whether it

2644.24 --> 2648.56
is in flesh

2645.68 --> 2649.44
of any form whether it is or taken over

2648.56 --> 2652.319
somebody

2649.44 --> 2654.0
whether it is in a unique body whether

2652.319 --> 2658.079
it is in a dark world

2654.0 --> 2659.599
dream connection it doesn't matter to me

2658.079 --> 2662.8
it only matters to me

2659.599 --> 2665.3590000000004
as an as a terrorist as an yeah it only

2662.8 --> 2666.48
matters that i recognize the frequency i

2665.359 --> 2668.96
know the palette

2666.48 --> 2670.079
only thing that matters is the palette

2668.96 --> 2673.119
of frequencies

2670.079 --> 2673.76
of the spirits that i see it at all

2673.119 --> 2678.1600000000003
times

2673.76 --> 2681.3590000000004
as a seer all times that's

2678.16 --> 2682.0
the way i do things and it works it

2681.359 --> 2685.92
works

2682.0 --> 2689.2
really well really really well

2685.92 --> 2693.28
i don't need exoteric details

2689.2 --> 2696.96
it doesn't matter to me in what form

2693.28 --> 2701.52
evil approaches i will recognize it

2696.96 --> 2701.52
that is the only thing that matters you

2702.839 --> 2708.0
see

2705.52 --> 2710.079
so that's yeah why i'm just not

2708.0 --> 2712.24
interested in filling in esoteric

2710.079 --> 2714.319
details so much

2712.24 --> 2715.7599999999998
i may reflect upon them if i have

2714.319 --> 2717.359
inspirations

2715.76 --> 2719.28
that's typically what i do but i don't

2717.359 --> 2722.0789999999997
have questions i i don't have

2719.28 --> 2722.8
questions like that anymore i don't seek

2722.079 --> 2727.52
to fill in

2722.8 --> 2727.52
esoteric literal details as much

2729.119 --> 2733.839
i leave that to other people

2739.28 --> 2742.4
and that's also because when you stick

2741.359 --> 2745.68
to specific

2742.4 --> 2747.44
esoteric outlining of something

2745.68 --> 2749.9199999999996
you know what the natural consequences

2747.44 --> 2752.2400000000002
you immediately

2749.92 --> 2753.28
you're kind of forced to protect it and

2752.24 --> 2756.319
there by

2753.28 --> 2759.8390000000004
reject other things

2756.319 --> 2762.0
other approaches you start rejecting

2759.839 --> 2762.7999999999997
them because you need to focus on your

2762.0 --> 2767.52
approach

2762.8 --> 2770.8
on your specific exoteric construction

2767.52 --> 2774.16
right that's

2770.8 --> 2778.079
not good for me i can't

2774.16 --> 2780.319
stay stuck to a very specific railroaded

2778.079 --> 2782.4
way of thinking like that i can't do it

2780.319 --> 2785.04
i can't do it

2782.4 --> 2785.04
i break

2786.56 --> 2792.56
the yeah the

2789.76 --> 2794.7200000000003
the little spirits the little impulses

2792.56 --> 2796.88
the

2794.72 --> 2802.9599999999996
they yeah they're they'll kill me

2796.88 --> 2805.6800000000003
they'll break me apart

2802.96 --> 2806.96
so the best i can do is just constantly

2805.68 --> 2810.3999999999996
just try to adapt

2806.96 --> 2811.68
what i do to to my energies and what i

2810.4 --> 2815.04
can do

2811.68 --> 2818.24
and aso terrorism in this

2815.04 --> 2818.72
specific high function seems like the

2818.24 --> 2823.2
best

2818.72 --> 2823.2
most unique and constructive option

2828.56 --> 2832.319
wow youtube's really cracking you guys

2831.52 --> 2835.359
see that too

2832.319 --> 2835.359
like the screen is like

2836.16 --> 2839.52
it's it's not gonna be visible on the

2838.319 --> 2842.8
recording

2839.52 --> 2845.04
but my youtube when i watch myself

2842.8 --> 2847.2000000000003
on youtube this is constantly happening

2845.04 --> 2850.079
very and it's only happening with me

2847.2 --> 2851.5989999999997
when i watch myself it's so weird

2850.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
in the live recording by the way because

2851.599 --> 2859.839
it doesn't happen playback

2865.119 --> 2869.6800000000003
i'm starting a virtual house church soon

2870.839 --> 2873.839
what

2877.28 --> 2882.079
but what does that mean basically do you

2879.52 --> 2885.68
mean like

2882.079 --> 2886.0
yeah like what people do at church just

2885.68 --> 2888.64
go

2886.0 --> 2891.119
sit in a circle and talk about the bible

2888.64 --> 2893.1189999999997
in some way or like how would you

2891.119 --> 2894.1600000000003
do you have a talk about the bible you

2893.119 --> 2896.6400000000003
would like to

2894.16 --> 2898.24
atone how you've discovered god that

2896.64 --> 2899.1189999999997
sort of is that what the virtual house

2898.24 --> 2902.5589999999997
church is

2899.119 --> 2905.92
i don't know if it i'm taking it now

2902.559 --> 2909.119
as like a specific show

2905.92 --> 2915.839
but if it is like a common thing

2909.119 --> 2915.839
i don't know

2929.92 --> 2933.2000000000003
anthony dickinson do you mean that you

2932.16 --> 2935.7599999999998
run

2933.2 --> 2935.7599999999998
that show

2940.88 --> 2957.839
i'm getting a little confused here

2964.079 --> 2971.8390000000004
and it may be in prison what

2973.28 --> 2977.6800000000003
so it it's going to be phc then

2978.4 --> 2984.2400000000002
chat is frozen ah thank you thank you

2980.96 --> 2987.76
for pointing that out you're right

2984.24 --> 2990.0
i didn't i didn't pay attention to the

2987.76 --> 2993.119
the chat in the video itself thank you

2990.0 --> 2993.119
for paying attention

2996.839 --> 2999.839
yep

3002.559 --> 3013.8390000000004
it should be back yeah it is

3016.88 --> 3020.6400000000003
[Music]

3019.04 --> 3023.44
all right well anthony dickinson you

3020.64 --> 3024.839
know doing that sort of thing i totally

3023.44 --> 3027.52
get it

3024.839 --> 3031.119
i went to this

3027.52 --> 3033.92
church over here for like one and a half

3031.119 --> 3036.4
year or something

3033.92 --> 3037.839
every sunday like almost every sunday

3036.4 --> 3040.0
most of every sunday

3037.839 --> 3041.92
it was before i did the early bird show

3040.0 --> 3044.64
every day

3041.92 --> 3046.48
and it really yeah it was very

3044.64 --> 3050.48
invigorating it really like

3046.48 --> 3053.119
drug me dragged me

3050.48 --> 3054.8
out of depression because that's where i

3053.119 --> 3058.079
was it's like i felt

3054.8 --> 3060.2400000000002
i was kind of like post being dumped by

3058.079 --> 3062.0
my ex not really having a good place to

3060.24 --> 3064.9599999999996
live anymore

3062.0 --> 3069.2
it was terrible i felt really shitty

3064.96 --> 3073.2
about myself

3069.2 --> 3075.1189999999997
right and yeah that just doing that

3073.2 --> 3076.3999999999996
and being among people and really

3075.119 --> 3081.52
figuring out like

3076.4 --> 3083.6800000000003
what focusing on the bible can do

3081.52 --> 3086.0
we like figuring out how interesting it

3083.68 --> 3089.2
really is

3086.0 --> 3091.599
like how mind-blowing it can really be

3089.2 --> 3092.64
like certain things about it seems so

3091.599 --> 3095.839
simple

3092.64 --> 3098.0789999999997
but when you are more

3095.839 --> 3098.88
intelligent more ascended and you don't

3098.079 --> 3101.04
constantly

3098.88 --> 3103.76
throw obstacles in there by being an

3101.04 --> 3107.2799999999997
exoterist against it

3103.76 --> 3108.3190000000004
then you start to see that even the

3107.28 --> 3111.119
simpler words

3108.319 --> 3112.16
often have much deeper implications have

3111.119 --> 3114.88
very specific

3112.16 --> 3117.1189999999997
frequency tasks so it's it's a

3114.88 --> 3121.44
mind-blowing book

3117.119 --> 3123.04
it really is and they can't really get

3121.44 --> 3126.16
that aspect out of it

3123.04 --> 3128.8
as well but

3126.16 --> 3131.44
that is as an experience and as a

3128.8 --> 3134.48
frequency reflector really

3131.44 --> 3137.2000000000003
because the esoteric details it

3134.48 --> 3138.4
i it just i just stopped i stopped

3137.2 --> 3142.3999999999996
caring

3138.4 --> 3142.4
like it doesn't matter to me anymore

3143.2 --> 3146.48
the only thing that matters is just

3146.0 --> 3150.0
things

3146.48 --> 3151.119
for example that christ did why he did

3150.0 --> 3155.92
it

3151.119 --> 3158.2400000000002
and just what kind of a person he was

3155.92 --> 3160.079
what yeah that frequency that comes with

3158.24 --> 3163.9199999999996
that and the deeper

3160.079 --> 3167.92
responses like the the deeper meaningful

3163.92 --> 3172.319
mercy and all these great

3167.92 --> 3175.52
virtues that's really what matters

3172.319 --> 3178.839
the frequencies of that and i and then

3175.52 --> 3180.72
in the face of that i just stopped

3178.839 --> 3183.52
caring whatever

3180.72 --> 3184.8799999999997
jesus not real person or it was two

3183.52 --> 3187.119
people when

3184.88 --> 3189.2000000000003
they did completely different things and

3187.119 --> 3190.7200000000003
it may be this conspiracy that

3189.2 --> 3193.839
conspiracy

3190.72 --> 3195.04
it just stopped caring because the

3193.839 --> 3198.0789999999997
message

3195.04 --> 3199.839
the frequencies involved

3198.079 --> 3201.2000000000003
and the experience of just dealing with

3199.839 --> 3203.2799999999997
the bible

3201.2 --> 3205.68
without being bothered constantly by

3203.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
opposition against it

3205.68 --> 3209.839
that is just worth it

3211.92 --> 3218.48
right jesus only spoke against churches

3215.92 --> 3220.16
in that case you might want to re

3218.48 --> 3222.8
consider calling it church

3220.16 --> 3224.319
this is but now what jesus effectively

3222.8 --> 3228.7200000000003
was against was against

3224.319 --> 3232.16
priesthoods basically

3228.72 --> 3235.5989999999997
to be the middle man for god

3232.16 --> 3238.72
that was like one of his primaries and

3235.599 --> 3239.92
yeah one primary concepts primary

3238.72 --> 3243.2
principles

3239.92 --> 3244.7200000000003
that means so much and that if if you

3243.2 --> 3246.64
forget about that

3244.72 --> 3248.72
if you just don't remember it then

3246.64 --> 3251.92
everything else

3248.72 --> 3255.359
it the deeper twist to it all

3251.92 --> 3259.76
will elude you and because

3255.359 --> 3259.7599999999998
in the depth of it the book is so loaded

3260.24 --> 3264.9599999999996
if you just really remember what is

3264.16 --> 3269.44
important

3264.96 --> 3272.48
consequentials and all that esoterically

3269.44 --> 3276.16
yeah but no middleman there was

3272.48 --> 3278.2400000000002
yeah no middleman for god

3276.16 --> 3282.48
that was critical and that's why most

3278.24 --> 3282.4799999999996
religions specifically religions

3283.92 --> 3290.7200000000003
so a church building is not

3288.079 --> 3292.319
a religion a church building is a

3290.72 --> 3294.64
gathering place

3292.319 --> 3295.44
but there can all be individualist

3294.64 --> 3298.4
christians

3295.44 --> 3299.119
in the church they would still have to

3298.4 --> 3302.4
like

3299.119 --> 3307.2000000000003
maintain it and [ __ ] and organize

3302.4 --> 3309.119
but it's the attitude like

3307.2 --> 3310.3999999999996
if there's going to be priests that are

3309.119 --> 3313.92
going to dictate

3310.4 --> 3315.76
to individuals about things

3313.92 --> 3317.359
then you got a problem then it's kind of

3315.76 --> 3319.8390000000004
like breaking

3317.359 --> 3321.92
christ's concept but if it's like

3319.839 --> 3325.359
everybody can have their own

3321.92 --> 3325.359
journey their own approach

3325.599 --> 3331.44
make their own decisions then

3328.96 --> 3332.319
then it's okay but yeah that still means

3331.44 --> 3334.64
it it can

3332.319 --> 3335.92
it can potentially be grabbler prone

3334.64 --> 3339.2799999999997
people could have been

3335.92 --> 3342.4
bought off at the top and then basically

3339.28 --> 3345.92
roll out propaganda to pollute

3342.4 --> 3345.92
the esoteric qualities

3346.0 --> 3351.28
get bad habits in bad ways of thinking

3349.2 --> 3352.319
it can be grappled and that's the

3351.28 --> 3356.4
problem with

3352.319 --> 3356.4
organized yeah groups

3356.48 --> 3363.2
and hey an individual

3359.68 --> 3364.96
just by themselves do yeah

3363.2 --> 3366.799
doing all the studies themselves

3364.96 --> 3368.48
reflection of bible is not gonna have

3366.799 --> 3371.599
that problem

3368.48 --> 3375.119
because it's it's just them and

3371.599 --> 3375.119
and god in the book

3375.76 --> 3379.8390000000004
so this uh yeah it's not even like rules

3378.799 --> 3383.599
you cannot break

3379.839 --> 3386.96
it's just natural mechanisms and

3383.599 --> 3389.2000000000003
logical consequences on an esoteric

3386.96 --> 3391.839
level

3389.2 --> 3391.839
see

3395.44 --> 3400.48
mechanisms of the spirit

3397.46 --> 3405.839
[Music]

3400.48 --> 3405.839
i think i got a title for this show

3407.119 --> 3419.839
i like that

3421.31 --> 3428.5389999999998
[Music]

3431.839 --> 3433.92
you

3454.72 --> 3458.319
right yeah anthony dickinson is a good

3457.92 --> 3462.7200000000003
point

3458.319 --> 3465.92
because here it comes if you're alone

3462.72 --> 3467.2799999999997
it's also very different when you deal

3465.92 --> 3468.799
with information

3467.28 --> 3470.96
when you're interacting with other

3468.799 --> 3472.48
people or if you're just listening to

3470.96 --> 3477.2
other people

3472.48 --> 3480.559
there is like more that happens

3477.2 --> 3483.5989999999997
so that's why having two or three people

3480.559 --> 3484.88
be together studying the bible then you

3483.599 --> 3486.88
have like

3484.88 --> 3488.799
it's not just you reading it and

3486.88 --> 3491.2000000000003
thinking about it you can like ask

3488.799 --> 3494.24
questions what do you think about this

3491.2 --> 3497.359
what do you think about this like

3494.24 --> 3500.0
you can basically spar the yeah

3497.359 --> 3500.5589999999997
juggle the information between people

3500.0 --> 3503.359
and get

3500.559 --> 3504.96
more out of it more ways of looking at

3503.359 --> 3508.16
the same thing

3504.96 --> 3510.16
it's very helpful for understanding it

3508.16 --> 3511.92
better for getting more perspectives

3510.16 --> 3513.5989999999997
than if you're just on your own so

3511.92 --> 3514.64
there's that advantage to having

3513.599 --> 3517.119
multiple people

3514.64 --> 3518.16
but that advantage kind of goes away

3517.119 --> 3521.2000000000003
when it becomes a

3518.16 --> 3523.5989999999997
really fast group because then

3521.2 --> 3524.319
it's just going to be the people that

3523.599 --> 3526.799
are the best

3524.319 --> 3528.0
conversers that they're the most

3526.799 --> 3530.64
comfortable with

3528.0 --> 3531.92
speaking to a group that are going to

3530.64 --> 3534.5589999999997
end up

3531.92 --> 3535.76
just sharing their version and everybody

3534.559 --> 3537.2000000000003
listening because you don't want to

3535.76 --> 3538.6400000000003
interrupt the flow

3537.2 --> 3540.3999999999996
that's what's going to happen in the big

3538.64 --> 3542.839
group see the dynamics

3540.4 --> 3544.88
the communication is very different like

3542.839 --> 3547.7599999999998
that

3544.88 --> 3550.88
unless it can be very well organized

3547.76 --> 3552.48
with a lot of very well organized people

3550.88 --> 3554.88
and then it would become more like a

3552.48 --> 3558.799
council like how we imagine

3554.88 --> 3562.319
like roman senators who are like

3558.799 --> 3565.599
just groups and they're all open

3562.319 --> 3567.2799999999997
oh this yeah i read versus reflection it

3565.599 --> 3569.3590000000004
was probably nothing like what

3567.28 --> 3570.7200000000003
it was in reality not the best

3569.359 --> 3572.799
comparison never mind

3570.72 --> 3573.839
but just like groups of people that are

3572.799 --> 3577.359
all

3573.839 --> 3579.44
all good speakers and that abide by a

3577.359 --> 3580.64
system an organized system of

3579.44 --> 3584.48
communication

3580.64 --> 3587.04
so that everybody can reflect upon

3584.48 --> 3588.72
better ideas but yeah that's not normal

3587.04 --> 3590.64
people that's not common people that's

3588.72 --> 3593.68
not just common christians

3590.64 --> 3595.359
you know that's more like a council

3593.68 --> 3600.64
situation

3595.359 --> 3604.0
or thinking like a big think tank

3600.64 --> 3604.799
so yeah that that's not common you can't

3604.0 --> 3608.079
just do that

3604.799 --> 3608.64
unless you like organize it specifically

3608.079 --> 3610.7200000000003
and

3608.64 --> 3612.319
be like oh we are like the council of

3610.72 --> 3615.4399999999996
christ or something

3612.319 --> 3619.119
but yeah that's prone to then luciferian

3615.44 --> 3621.52
uh luciferian ideas

3619.119 --> 3623.839
and seductions because of arrogance if

3621.52 --> 3624.64
you're all smarter then you're going to

3623.839 --> 3627.2799999999997
also

3624.64 --> 3628.0
we have the tendency as a unit with it's

3627.28 --> 3631.52
a group

3628.0 --> 3633.119
to leave lesser thinkers behind

3631.52 --> 3636.559
and not respect them as much you know

3633.119 --> 3639.839
that see that that's the issue with that

3636.559 --> 3643.0400000000004
so a three-group system

3639.839 --> 3646.4
is indeed probably the best dynamic

3643.04 --> 3646.4
a three-person group

3653.17 --> 3657.839
[Music]

3654.839 --> 3657.839
overall

3666.0 --> 3672.48
which by the way is kind of interesting

3669.839 --> 3673.2799999999997
yeah before the whole corona lockdown

3672.48 --> 3677.599
situation

3673.28 --> 3680.6400000000003
absolutely ruined the mormon church here

3677.599 --> 3683.76
they typically do that they

3680.64 --> 3686.0
they take two guys they're like me

3683.76 --> 3687.44
people yeah young people in missionary

3686.0 --> 3688.16
function which is something they have to

3687.44 --> 3690.48
do

3688.16 --> 3691.7599999999998
it's part of the whole yeah organization

3690.48 --> 3694.079
of the church

3691.76 --> 3695.5200000000004
and they go with two and then they visit

3694.079 --> 3697.599
individuals

3695.52 --> 3699.92
that's interesting because that way they

3697.599 --> 3703.04
have the three people system

3699.92 --> 3706.48
automatically built in and i've had

3703.04 --> 3709.7599999999998
great great deep conversations

3706.48 --> 3712.16
with them many times where they

3709.76 --> 3714.7200000000003
came to visit we talked about all kinds

3712.16 --> 3718.48
of deep things and even world war is

3714.72 --> 3720.72
worries and all that and end times and

3718.48 --> 3721.68
everything you can think of and i even

3720.72 --> 3725.4399999999996
kind of like

3721.68 --> 3726.24
really laid the foundation for my own

3725.44 --> 3729.28
confidence

3726.24 --> 3730.72
in this approach being an eclectic

3729.28 --> 3733.6800000000003
esoteric christian

3730.72 --> 3735.5989999999997
it was kind of my decision after being

3733.68 --> 3737.68
in the church for a while

3735.599 --> 3739.92
and then i just learned to come out for

3737.68 --> 3741.5989999999997
it and i did it through typically those

3739.92 --> 3745.359
conversations

3741.599 --> 3748.6400000000003
three people two missionaries come

3745.359 --> 3750.64
we talk for like an hour or more

3748.64 --> 3755.2799999999997
if i could like i would talk endlessly

3750.64 --> 3758.4
about that and they would have such

3755.28 --> 3762.6400000000003
good spirits to reflect upon like

3758.4 --> 3764.7200000000003
not dumb spirit but very eager and

3762.64 --> 3766.24
confident like they were blessed by

3764.72 --> 3769.2
angels almost like

3766.24 --> 3770.5589999999997
i can't explain it it's something

3769.2 --> 3772.3999999999996
special

3770.559 --> 3774.799
it's not that they were miraculous

3772.4 --> 3778.1600000000003
persons but just the way

3774.799 --> 3778.16
their attitudes were

3778.88 --> 3782.7200000000003
it made them really a blessing to

3780.88 --> 3785.039
interact with even on the intellectual

3782.72 --> 3785.0389999999998
level

3791.68 --> 3796.8799999999997
yeah but yeah i think that's all gone

3795.039 --> 3799.039
now because now they don't do that

3796.88 --> 3799.839
anymore as far as i know they don't even

3799.039 --> 3803.6800000000003
really do

3799.839 --> 3803.68
church anymore they don't

3803.839 --> 3810.64
i think they still do like baptisms

3806.88 --> 3812.7200000000003
and all that but other than that they

3810.64 --> 3816.0
don't come together anymore

3812.72 --> 3817.2799999999997
on sunday and i i then i probably don't

3816.0 --> 3820.16
think they do house fit

3817.28 --> 3820.1600000000003
visits anymore

3822.96 --> 3826.2400000000002
because i don't see him

3827.76 --> 3831.2000000000003
i think they've gone completely onto the

3829.68 --> 3839.839
internet now

3831.2 --> 3839.839
that's not the same

3858.64 --> 3861.75
[Music]

3864.839 --> 3867.839
uh

3868.05 --> 3871.179
[Music]

3876.96 --> 3895.839
anyway yeah this is a very uh

3881.52 --> 3895.839
christian episode today

3905.92 --> 3912.16
it's also funny you know moods and

3909.839 --> 3914.72
like the whole ups and downs

3912.16 --> 3917.2
oscillations even in

3914.72 --> 3918.9599999999996
and just how much i can pick up with my

3917.2 --> 3921.1189999999997
senses for my intellect

3918.96 --> 3922.16
no my eyes will always work my ears will

3921.119 --> 3926.0
always work

3922.16 --> 3929.2799999999997
but the parts of the brain that actually

3926.0 --> 3931.92
do stuff with that data

3929.28 --> 3932.3190000000004
that seems and that's something you

3931.92 --> 3935.599
don't

3932.319 --> 3937.119
really notice as much you know

3935.599 --> 3939.839
it's not on the forefront of your

3937.119 --> 3942.559
attention it's what's behind it

3939.839 --> 3945.0389999999998
those mechanisms are separate from your

3942.559 --> 3948.0
active engagement of things

3945.039 --> 3949.039
and that can kind of oscillate and then

3948.0 --> 3951.119
it's it's weird

3949.039 --> 3953.44
because it also changes like what your

3951.119 --> 3955.28
mood is at so much

3953.44 --> 3957.92
if you enjoy like if you get a lot of

3955.28 --> 3961.8390000000004
details then i for example

3957.92 --> 3965.28
like very cleared up what i want then

3961.839 --> 3968.88
is like

3965.28 --> 3970.7200000000003
good music like

3968.88 --> 3972.2400000000002
it's typically when i start to listen to

3970.72 --> 3974.48
like baldur's gate to

3972.24 --> 3976.319
music because it's like interesting

3974.48 --> 3980.64
classical very varied but

3976.319 --> 3983.68
very robust with a lot of spirit in it

3980.64 --> 3987.44
and enthusiasm and it's

3983.68 --> 3988.48
not evil it has like challenges in it

3987.44 --> 3992.2400000000002
it's just not

3988.48 --> 3994.48
there's there is also evil is addressed

3992.24 --> 3997.0389999999998
but it's also i don't know the way i

3994.48 --> 4001.039
reflect on it it's just not evil

3997.039 --> 4003.6800000000003
and i like it it's weird to say that

4001.039 --> 4004.4
because it is called boulder's gate and

4003.68 --> 4006.64
it's about

4004.4 --> 4009.28
the god of murder and all that it's so

4006.64 --> 4012.8799999999997
weird you know

4009.28 --> 4014.88
but the music is just good it's very

4012.88 --> 4017.359
good it's very rich i

4014.88 --> 4018.799
just trying to imagine back sometimes

4017.359 --> 4021.0389999999998
what it's like

4018.799 --> 4023.119
when i first played that game and just

4021.039 --> 4023.599
heard the music for the first time as i

4023.119 --> 4026.799
was

4023.599 --> 4027.76
figuring out how with the visuals how it

4026.799 --> 4030.88
worked

4027.76 --> 4032.7990000000004
and where to go and what is the wisest

4030.88 --> 4033.52
course of action for my characters now

4032.799 --> 4035.359
that

4033.52 --> 4036.88
while basically listening to that music

4035.359 --> 4039.5989999999997
in the background and i'm just trying to

4036.88 --> 4039.599
imagine like

4039.76 --> 4045.6800000000003
the momentous impact that made without

4043.2 --> 4046.839
even me realizing it as much the music

4045.68 --> 4050.0789999999997
made so much

4046.839 --> 4053.119
impact that

4050.079 --> 4055.44
especially baldur's gate to the the

4053.119 --> 4060.079
final parts when i ended the game i

4055.44 --> 4063.68
was so exhilarated so incredibly like

4060.079 --> 4066.1600000000003
in a kick like holy like whoa

4063.68 --> 4067.1189999999997
so much that after the game kind of

4066.16 --> 4069.839
ended i was

4067.119 --> 4071.359
really depressed really freaking

4069.839 --> 4074.319
depressed

4071.359 --> 4077.2
because that was just such a rush to me

4074.319 --> 4079.119
the first time

4077.2 --> 4081.52
and with the anticipation built up you

4079.119 --> 4084.1600000000003
know when you play through the game

4081.52 --> 4085.52
the music also works into like this

4084.16 --> 4089.0389999999998
natural

4085.52 --> 4090.559
it's it's a master design absolutely one

4089.039 --> 4094.7990000000004
of the best

4090.559 --> 4097.279
musical arrangements

4094.799 --> 4099.839
that i've ever come across i can't say

4097.279 --> 4101.92
it enough

4099.839 --> 4104.88
when you go through it all especially

4101.92 --> 4105.52
when you don't take your time and listen

4104.88 --> 4108.799
every song

4105.52 --> 4109.4400000000005
specifically but just let it hear it in

4108.799 --> 4112.799
the background

4109.44 --> 4115.839
as you play your game and focus on that

4112.799 --> 4115.839
it's astounding

4116.799 --> 4120.719
so yeah and when i'm really

4121.92 --> 4126.159
when i have all my senses the the

4124.239 --> 4128.08
mechanisms to basically interpret my

4126.159 --> 4131.04
senses when i have them all maximized i

4128.08 --> 4135.359
really like to listen to that

4131.04 --> 4137.6
because it almost makes me able to just

4135.359 --> 4139.6
re use the music and then reflect it

4137.6 --> 4140.64
upon other things in the world and all

4139.6 --> 4147.839
that

4140.64 --> 4152.2390000000005
and um yeah

4147.839 --> 4152.239
i don't know i like it i like doing that

4158.88 --> 4163.04
it's good music to dream with

4163.99 --> 4167.099999999999
[Music]

4171.359 --> 4174.56
but yeah when i'm for example very tired

4173.839 --> 4176.96
out say

4174.56 --> 4177.759
late in the evening then listening to

4176.96 --> 4179.92
this music

4177.759 --> 4180.88
actually becomes like a burden it's like

4179.92 --> 4184.0
a strain

4180.88 --> 4187.04
so then i don't like to listen to it

4184.0 --> 4187.359
like for me it's best to listen to it

4187.04 --> 4190.319
like

4187.359 --> 4190.319
before the show

4191.04 --> 4194.64
you sometimes i listen to baldur's gate

4193.6 --> 4196.8
music before the show

4194.64 --> 4198.64
sometimes i listen to my collection of

4196.8 --> 4200.159000000001
electronic music

4198.64 --> 4203.92
that is also really good but it's

4200.159 --> 4207.12
completely different it's much more like

4203.92 --> 4210.719
wake up shaking shaking you

4207.12 --> 4210.719
awake in a different way

4213.44 --> 4216.5599999999995
but in a good way with beauty a lot of

4215.76 --> 4219.92
beauty

4216.56 --> 4219.92
but it's just much rougher

4221.44 --> 4225.5199999999995
much more shaking you awake to it

4228.84 --> 4236.32
huh

4231.679 --> 4236.32
uh anyway moving on

4236.56 --> 4240.96
a little bit about the music and hey if

4239.199 --> 4242.0
you want to know what music i'm talking

4240.96 --> 4245.84
about

4242.0 --> 4245.84
just put that link there again

4250.239 --> 4253.599999999999
i'm gonna give you a link specifically

4253.04 --> 4255.679
time to

4253.6 --> 4258.910000000001
my favorite song in the entire spectrum

4255.679 --> 4260.8
which is like a two-thirds of it

4258.91 --> 4263.76
[Music]

4260.8 --> 4265.76
but you'll get a good good feeling of

4263.76 --> 4269.1990000000005
what i'm talking about and also i'm

4265.76 --> 4271.1990000000005
i'm i'm kind of envious of the guy that

4269.199 --> 4273.44
that made it all i really am because

4271.199 --> 4276.08
it's just so impressed

4273.44 --> 4277.36
and i'm just wondering like how did it's

4276.08 --> 4280.64
obviously

4277.36 --> 4284.08
grafted together from great

4280.64 --> 4284.56
music great great music and it's made

4284.08 --> 4288.159
like a

4284.56 --> 4292.159000000001
film music style like that but i'm just

4288.159 --> 4292.159
wondering like how did he do that

4292.64 --> 4300.08
just take brilliant concepts

4297.04 --> 4304.4
cut them apart and then like redesign

4300.08 --> 4304.4
them into a short paced

4305.12 --> 4309.199
yeah chain of music and and it works so

4308.48 --> 4312.718999999999
well

4309.199 --> 4316.239
it's not always absolutely perfect

4312.719 --> 4319.12
but it works so well it's like

4316.239 --> 4321.28
good enough and like there's majestic

4319.12 --> 4322.8
just constructions that are mind-blowing

4321.28 --> 4325.28
you're almost like wow

4322.8 --> 4326.08
i can't imagine that like a there might

4325.28 --> 4328.719
have been

4326.08 --> 4330.64
people in history that that loved music

4328.719 --> 4334.2390000000005
that had thought of like doing that

4330.64 --> 4336.96
and he must have like collected like

4334.239 --> 4338.0
great things you can do with music

4336.96 --> 4339.679
combinations

4338.0 --> 4343.84
that of things that existed and then

4339.679 --> 4343.84
grafted it together so eloquently

4346.08 --> 4351.5199999999995
it's like and don't mean to be harsh at

4349.199 --> 4353.199
all but it's like a frankenstein monster

4351.52 --> 4356.64
that's

4353.199 --> 4360.32
like amazingly beautiful

4356.64 --> 4363.360000000001
and effective because it is

4360.32 --> 4363.759999999999
i think very obviously crafted together

4363.36 --> 4366.799999999999
for

4363.76 --> 4368.88
many different great musics

4366.8 --> 4372.0
and you'll probably recognize it if

4368.88 --> 4375.36
you're really a classical music lover

4372.0 --> 4378.56
in these styles if you for example

4375.36 --> 4380.0
loved the conan the barbarian movie the

4378.56 --> 4381.76
original one

4380.0 --> 4383.6
with with arnold schwarzenegger the

4381.76 --> 4385.52
music of that there's many elements and

4383.6 --> 4387.76
specifically the song i link to is

4385.52 --> 4389.120000000001
just has elements of that you'll you

4387.76 --> 4392.2390000000005
feel

4389.12 --> 4394.88
that style that age feeling

4392.239 --> 4396.839999999999
and there's like all kinds of influences

4394.88 --> 4399.84
in it

4396.84 --> 4399.84
anyway

4401.92 --> 4406.4
i keep retorting back to the music it's

4404.32 --> 4410.0
funny because the game

4406.4 --> 4413.199
i've i've let that game

4410.0 --> 4415.12
dry in every concealer

4413.199 --> 4417.199
that's the most played game i've ever

4415.12 --> 4418.88
played especially the first one by the

4417.199 --> 4421.36
way

4418.88 --> 4423.04
which music is also kind of good it's

4421.36 --> 4425.839999999999
more interesting because there's a lot

4423.04 --> 4428.88
of atmospheric

4425.84 --> 4432.32
like really background atmospheric music

4428.88 --> 4435.4400000000005
with classical stuff that's like

4432.32 --> 4437.28
that's just really special the first

4435.44 --> 4437.919999999999
baldur's gate but the second one is more

4437.28 --> 4442.719
of a

4437.92 --> 4446.8
more of a composition type mute an epos

4442.719 --> 4450.0
and i've played it all so much

4446.8 --> 4453.679
like maybe a thousand times it's crazy

4450.0 --> 4454.8
i know every freaking detail about the i

4453.679 --> 4457.4400000000005
know

4454.8 --> 4458.88
like how the algorithms even work

4457.44 --> 4461.919999999999
intuitively of

4458.88 --> 4464.56
drops in loot and shipments

4461.92 --> 4465.52
and i know exactly where i can expect

4464.56 --> 4467.04
what i know which

4465.52 --> 4469.040000000001
things are set where i can find

4467.04 --> 4470.64
everything it's crazy how much i played

4469.04 --> 4472.88
that it's

4470.64 --> 4474.4800000000005
but it was really because of the music

4472.88 --> 4476.8
now i don't really play it

4474.48 --> 4478.5599999999995
anymore that often because i pretty much

4476.8 --> 4480.8
done everything you can

4478.56 --> 4481.84
possibly imagine to do with that

4480.8 --> 4485.04
freaking game

4481.84 --> 4485.84
even without cheating i've done some

4485.04 --> 4488.159
with cheating

4485.84 --> 4490.0
that kind of turned lame very quickly

4488.159 --> 4491.36
then i stopped doing that and then just

4490.0 --> 4493.52
turns out yeah i've

4491.36 --> 4494.48
done every freaking thing you can

4493.52 --> 4498.719
imagine

4494.48 --> 4502.08
so i don't play it anymore but the music

4498.719 --> 4503.76
i can play that forever

4502.08 --> 4505.6
until i'm kind of sick of it and then i

4503.76 --> 4509.4400000000005
forget about it and then

4505.6 --> 4513.52
after a long time it's suddenly like oh

4509.44 --> 4515.12
let me hear that again oh so good yeah

4513.52 --> 4516.719
and i think i'll probably be listening

4515.12 --> 4521.599999999999
to that

4516.719 --> 4525.84
till the end of my days i think maybe

4521.6 --> 4525.84
i have for over 20 years

4533.84 --> 4542.64
yeah in ways also it's it's a

4538.239 --> 4542.639999999999
regret with me

4542.8 --> 4548.719
that my mother died like 15 years ago

4546.56 --> 4549.76
suddenly out of nowhere bring this up

4548.719 --> 4553.6
because she was

4549.76 --> 4554.88
a composer a classical composer and she

4553.6 --> 4558.320000000001
loved

4554.88 --> 4561.28
this music she she loved

4558.32 --> 4561.679
classical music in all these beauty like

4561.28 --> 4563.84
she

4561.679 --> 4565.6
really appreciated baldur's gate music

4563.84 --> 4566.64
as well and she recognized it was

4565.6 --> 4568.96
grafted

4566.64 --> 4570.88
and it kind of made her jealous too just

4568.96 --> 4572.32
like i feel what what's going on is my

4570.88 --> 4577.84
internet

4572.32 --> 4577.84
cutting out youtube screwing up again

4578.08 --> 4583.199
and i really i've been imagining many

4581.52 --> 4585.360000000001
times what it would have been like if

4583.199 --> 4590.719
she was still

4585.36 --> 4590.719
alive now and not going insane

4592.08 --> 4597.04
i really wanted her to compose certain

4594.64 --> 4597.04
music

4599.52 --> 4604.64
like could she have like if i

4602.56 --> 4606.88
i kind of envisioned that i would be

4604.64 --> 4608.0
going into game making and then i hope

4606.88 --> 4612.32
that she would make

4608.0 --> 4615.12
music classical music for those games

4612.32 --> 4617.92
but yeah she went a little bit liberal i

4615.12 --> 4620.84
didn't even recognize it too much

4617.92 --> 4622.96
and so that didn't seem to be able to

4620.84 --> 4626.32
happen

4622.96 --> 4626.32
she probably wouldn't have done that

4627.12 --> 4634.159
but i yeah i dream sometimes what if man

4630.239 --> 4637.678999999999
what if wouldn't that have been amazing

4634.159 --> 4638.719
like yeah i don't know i almost imagined

4637.679 --> 4641.84
like

4638.719 --> 4646.32
to have a family that could all be

4641.84 --> 4649.4400000000005
just a computer game company

4646.32 --> 4654.96
as a family crazy idea

4649.44 --> 4654.96
crazy idea didn't really work out

4661.28 --> 4666.08
but who knows man who knows in the

4663.199 --> 4669.04
future maybe i could be the one to found

4666.08 --> 4672.08
the family like that

4669.04 --> 4673.76
just get them all into music painting

4672.08 --> 4676.08
and [ __ ] hey that's what my parents did

4673.76 --> 4676.08
with me

4676.48 --> 4682.4
and then just suggest like hey we can

4679.92 --> 4685.28
actually combine our forces and make

4682.4 --> 4688.4
something with that

4685.28 --> 4693.36
that would be a great thrill for them

4688.4 --> 4696.5599999999995
i think

4693.36 --> 4707.28
but yeah do you have to get kids first i

4696.56 --> 4709.92
hope that'll happen one day

4707.28 --> 4711.12
hmm original starcraft cool kevin

4709.92 --> 4716.56
horizons

4711.12 --> 4716.5599999999995
there's they they reef uh you call that

4716.64 --> 4723.52
they amped it up or like adapted

4720.48 --> 4726.08
the old game to modern computers

4723.52 --> 4730.0
and better interface and all that so

4726.08 --> 4730.0
they adapted the old staircraft

4730.48 --> 4736.0
they updated it yeah remastered that's

4734.56 --> 4739.679
what it's called

4736.0 --> 4741.6
i know that that's happened for a while

4739.679 --> 4743.84
i'm not so interested in starcraft

4741.6 --> 4745.679
though

4743.84 --> 4749.84
i think it's a really good game it's

4745.679 --> 4749.84
just that

4755.36 --> 4760.639999999999
i'm not yeah i don't know what it is

4758.64 --> 4762.0
maybe i've just played too many strategy

4760.64 --> 4763.52
games in that fashion

4762.0 --> 4765.679
and they're very interesting but i've

4763.52 --> 4770.159000000001
just played too many of them

4765.679 --> 4773.36
too much i'm more interested in

4770.159 --> 4775.759999999999
i don't know maybe strategical games

4773.36 --> 4779.599999999999
with rpg elements

4775.76 --> 4783.4400000000005
i like turn based a lot i like it

4779.6 --> 4786.320000000001
it's also very d you know tabletop d d

4783.44 --> 4790.239
is turn based

4786.32 --> 4792.639999999999
when you get into action situations

4790.239 --> 4794.799999999999
so i yeah i like to stick to games like

4792.64 --> 4798.96
that where you can basically

4794.8 --> 4801.92
walk away without the game breaking

4798.96 --> 4803.199
and then yeah just press next turn or

4801.92 --> 4805.76
the next action

4803.199 --> 4808.638999999999
and it moves on like that it's very easy

4805.76 --> 4812.719
to do that and multitask

4808.639 --> 4812.719
so i just prefer that kind of game now

4816.4 --> 4822.799999999999
like xcom 2. anyway this is yeah moving

4819.679 --> 4822.8
away from the uh

4822.88 --> 4827.12
christian esoteric reflections a lot

4827.52 --> 4836.0
into more common things our wind does

4833.6 --> 4838.8
and yeah i still waste a lot of my time

4836.0 --> 4838.8
playing games

4840.639 --> 4846.719
although yeah as i already said

4844.32 --> 4847.84
it's almost impossible for me to really

4846.719 --> 4849.36
waste something

4847.84 --> 4851.6
whatever i'm doing i have to do

4849.36 --> 4854.239
something with it or it it's gonna drive

4851.6 --> 4854.2390000000005
me insane

4859.12 --> 4863.84
i can't afford to do something that i

4862.159 --> 4865.679
can't get anything out of

4863.84 --> 4867.84
i just can't afford it anymore for my

4865.679 --> 4869.92
sanity

4867.84 --> 4871.84
i have to always do something useful

4869.92 --> 4874.25
with whatever i'm gonna do even if it's

4871.84 --> 4877.319
just something little

4874.25 --> 4877.319
[Music]

4898.0 --> 4903.28
now this is some old

4901.199 --> 4905.678999999999
some old game consoles there mark

4903.28 --> 4905.679
colored

4908.08 --> 4915.679
like my my parents had an atari

4912.0 --> 4918.96
desktop computer that they used

4915.679 --> 4922.4800000000005
to write music with

4918.96 --> 4925.92
seriously that

4922.48 --> 4929.12
a program that yeah you can

4925.92 --> 4932.159
use to basically print out

4929.12 --> 4934.5599999999995
music sheets yeah music

4932.159 --> 4936.96
and they used the atari desktop thingy

4934.56 --> 4936.96
for that

4937.199 --> 4940.48
that's an old computer

4943.04 --> 4947.36
it was really special though because it

4944.96 --> 4959.84
had a monitor like a tube monitor with

4947.36 --> 4959.839999999999
color screen

4967.6 --> 4975.84
yeah i think even that those

4970.719 --> 4978.08
books my mother wrote about music theory

4975.84 --> 4981.28
that i think that she even wrote that

4978.08 --> 4984.639
basically with that atari computer

4981.28 --> 4986.88
desktop such an old thing he didn't even

4984.639 --> 4990.159000000001
really have any games on it

4986.88 --> 4992.32
or maybe just yeah the super basics

4990.159 --> 4993.199
but there was no capacity to do anything

4992.32 --> 4997.04
with it

4993.199 --> 5001.839999999999
except yeah that

4997.04 --> 5001.84
and it was slow

5012.4 --> 5018.96
yeah that's right mark collard i agree

5016.239 --> 5020.959999999999
yeah because like newer games even they

5018.96 --> 5023.12
have just broken elements to it but

5020.96 --> 5023.44
they're just relying on the graphics to

5023.12 --> 5027.12
be

5023.44 --> 5031.5199999999995
so impressive that they just

5027.12 --> 5034.32
don't care to even even it out

5031.52 --> 5035.92
too much you know they'll when they try

5034.32 --> 5040.5599999999995
to prevent the game from

5035.92 --> 5041.28
breaking but just like sloppy details

5040.56 --> 5044.400000000001
are so

5041.28 --> 5046.32
often just left in because

5044.4 --> 5048.0
they just don't care and if they know

5046.32 --> 5050.88
the graphics are good enough

5048.0 --> 5050.88
people won't see it

5051.199 --> 5057.839999999999
the general public the the money cow

5072.719 --> 5076.08
what kevin horizon's roots of esoteric

5074.88 --> 5079.12
christianity

5076.08 --> 5080.88
i won't know is there a root of esoteric

5079.12 --> 5083.92
christianity

5080.88 --> 5087.12
this is my christian

5083.92 --> 5090.159
i'm eclectic the this is the the pat

5087.12 --> 5091.599999999999
this is where it arrived at esoteric

5090.159 --> 5095.44
i don't know if there is such a

5091.6 --> 5098.320000000001
tradition anywhere i really don't know

5095.44 --> 5100.08
it just makes sense to me that there

5098.32 --> 5103.199
probably was

5100.08 --> 5106.32
but i'm literally starting it so i'm not

5103.199 --> 5108.48
like oh i read this book recently man

5106.32 --> 5110.239
specifically about this so man i'm i'm

5108.48 --> 5112.32
part i'm now an esoteric christian

5110.239 --> 5116.5599999999995
because i want to be part of that group

5112.32 --> 5119.92
no it's this is my natural conclusion

5116.56 --> 5119.92
this is part of my path

5120.08 --> 5125.04
these are my methods so it could be that

5122.639 --> 5127.12
there are others i don't know

5125.04 --> 5129.12
i don't necessarily want to tie myself

5127.12 --> 5133.04
into any specific group

5129.12 --> 5133.04
because of political consequences

5138.96 --> 5143.44
all right i'm already designated

5140.639 --> 5143.4400000000005

5163.12 --> 5169.84
very debate the burn

5170.159 --> 5176.879999999999
wondering if i had an opinion

5173.6 --> 5178.56
well i would have to know

5176.88 --> 5183.84
exactly what you're talking about to

5178.56 --> 5183.84
have an opinion about it

5184.239 --> 5187.599999999999
and i don't know maybe

5188.32 --> 5192.88
palestine might these are all just like

5191.44 --> 5195.12
these historical

5192.88 --> 5197.679
perspectives and trying to figure out

5195.12 --> 5200.159
what happened historically and all that

5197.679 --> 5202.4
and that stuff just gives me a head it's

5200.159 --> 5206.159
just a distraction

5202.4 --> 5208.08
to me at this point although i i do

5206.159 --> 5209.199
pick up like a lot of these what i

5208.08 --> 5212.96
consider it to be

5209.199 --> 5215.5199999999995
rumors and i don't take them as just

5212.96 --> 5216.4800000000005
nonsense i do keep them in mind like if

5215.52 --> 5220.0
those things have been

5216.48 --> 5222.32
said then at some point it might start

5220.0 --> 5224.4
to make more sense

5222.32 --> 5225.44
and reveal a structure that i couldn't

5224.4 --> 5229.28
before

5225.44 --> 5232.32
determined to be there or that i have

5229.28 --> 5235.759999999999
heard but i was just not sensible to

5232.32 --> 5239.36
absolutely embrace it yet because i

5235.76 --> 5241.6
didn't have enough certainty about it

5239.36 --> 5241.599999999999
right

5244.719 --> 5249.76
who discovered america they say

5246.719 --> 5252.0
christopher columbus no way

5249.76 --> 5252.8
never stepped foot on america i believe

5252.0 --> 5256.56
you he did

5252.8 --> 5256.56
only like on the islands right

5259.12 --> 5265.28
or mexico or something i don't know

5262.88 --> 5266.2390000000005
i it doesn't really matter anyway

5265.28 --> 5269.28
because yeah

5266.239 --> 5272.48
america was pretty much

5269.28 --> 5272.48
already settled on

5274.08 --> 5281.6
there were plenty of irish

5277.76 --> 5284.88
settlers and viking descendants

5281.6 --> 5287.92
that have been there for a long time

5284.88 --> 5290.400000000001
way before columbus or yeah tried to go

5287.92 --> 5290.4
over there

5292.88 --> 5296.56
i don't know if there was any ship if

5294.96 --> 5297.44
there was any trading routes you know

5296.56 --> 5300.8
was there even

5297.44 --> 5304.0
was there trade between america

5300.8 --> 5308.159000000001
yeah and in europe

5304.0 --> 5310.32
with those old settlers was there any

5308.159 --> 5312.799999999999
did they only trade with the northerners

5310.32 --> 5315.84
or with like norway or

5312.8 --> 5317.76
iceland i don't know

5315.84 --> 5319.52
it makes sense if there was just plenty

5317.76 --> 5323.679
of civilized

5319.52 --> 5325.679
groups and farms and stuff

5323.679 --> 5327.4400000000005
that there would be some trade of some

5325.679 --> 5330.56
kind through ships

5327.44 --> 5332.159
i don't know though how that worked

5330.56 --> 5336.400000000001
who was trading with it was england

5332.159 --> 5338.879999999999
trading with that

5336.4 --> 5338.879999999999
i don't know

5341.679 --> 5346.56
or were they like isolation is like

5343.6 --> 5350.08
really trying to keep away from

5346.56 --> 5352.320000000001
from european kings and and all that

5350.08 --> 5355.199
the kingdoms trying to stay away from

5352.32 --> 5358.32
that and just trying to like boot up

5355.199 --> 5359.44
some kind of weird original america idea

5358.32 --> 5364.0
like completely

5359.44 --> 5368.32
independent individualist and all that

5364.0 --> 5370.08
and then yeah the kingdoms kind of found

5368.32 --> 5373.36
out and started to basically

5370.08 --> 5376.5599999999995
colonize it all and then even

5373.36 --> 5376.88
yeah don't even mention that they were

5376.56 --> 5378.719
there

5376.88 --> 5379.92
just saying no no we just killed all the

5378.719 --> 5383.28
indians no no

5379.92 --> 5385.84
what irish people what vikings

5383.28 --> 5385.84
no no no

5386.32 --> 5391.92
that that didn't even exist you know

5389.84 --> 5394.4800000000005
and yeah you could consider that those

5391.92 --> 5397.12
people might have been the original

5394.48 --> 5398.159
founding fathers before the founding

5397.12 --> 5407.84
fathers

5398.159 --> 5407.839999999999
wrote the document even

5408.0 --> 5413.28
ah thank you anthony dickinson yes yes

5410.0 --> 5413.28
yes caribbean exactly

5414.239 --> 5421.839999999999
the sugarlands

5424.56 --> 5429.76
that's where they they had all the the

5427.36 --> 5433.44
sugar cane farms

5429.76 --> 5435.84
eventually right that's what i

5433.44 --> 5435.839999999999
remember

5450.86 --> 5454.0199999999995
[Music]

5463.12 --> 5470.48
oh by the way how do i know

5467.12 --> 5472.96
like things also about like

5470.48 --> 5474.0
columbus and caribbean in this period

5472.96 --> 5477.12
it's so weird

5474.0 --> 5477.44
i learned more this is really weird in a

5477.12 --> 5480.88
way

5477.44 --> 5483.919999999999
i learned more about it by playing

5480.88 --> 5487.4400000000005
games in the theme because some of them

5483.92 --> 5489.28
are halfway accurate

5487.44 --> 5491.5199999999995
they're accurate enough to give a good

5489.28 --> 5494.639
picture of what it was like

5491.52 --> 5496.400000000001
roughly then he always like give the

5494.639 --> 5498.2390000000005
player of course the

5496.4 --> 5499.44
possibility for absolute dominance and

5498.239 --> 5502.48
all that that makes it

5499.44 --> 5504.719
unrealistic but there's so many games

5502.48 --> 5507.28
that have like themes

5504.719 --> 5508.4
based on this historic age and there was

5507.28 --> 5512.639
this game that was

5508.4 --> 5512.638999999999
very much about trading also

5513.36 --> 5517.679
i love that game this is civilization

5516.8 --> 5519.76
four

5517.679 --> 5520.96
had a special edition that was just

5519.76 --> 5523.1990000000005
about

5520.96 --> 5524.4
going to america and then building a

5523.199 --> 5528.239
trade system

5524.4 --> 5530.239
and farms and all that and and

5528.239 --> 5531.44
educate the people and then eventually

5530.239 --> 5535.199
like the european

5531.44 --> 5537.199
king would come in like a final battle

5535.199 --> 5539.28
and try to take it over and then if you

5537.199 --> 5542.638999999999
won that you got independence

5539.28 --> 5546.08
it was great and

5542.639 --> 5548.400000000001
yeah it just you pick up little details

5546.08 --> 5550.639
like from that game it's like okay

5548.4 --> 5554.719
tobacco

5550.639 --> 5561.84
cotton sugar

5554.719 --> 5561.84
and what what else like uh

5562.159 --> 5568.96
of course grain also but just be you get

5565.36 --> 5571.759999999999
exposed to just a rough

5568.96 --> 5574.159
template oversimplified usually of what

5571.76 --> 5576.56
they're doing and because of that

5574.159 --> 5577.199
that kind of still rubbed off on me

5576.56 --> 5579.6
despite

5577.199 --> 5582.239
that i i'm not like a person like oh i

5579.6 --> 5586.0
read all the original

5582.239 --> 5586.638999999999
journals of these these pioneers and all

5586.0 --> 5589.52
that

5586.639 --> 5590.719
i'm not a historically red in person but

5589.52 --> 5592.400000000001
i've still like

5590.719 --> 5593.84
got plenty of things that rubbed off on

5592.4 --> 5596.4
me and that's also

5593.84 --> 5599.92
useful it's useful to kind of get a

5596.4 --> 5602.159
better picture of the purpose

5599.92 --> 5603.52
of what people are doing what drives

5602.159 --> 5605.92
them

5603.52 --> 5605.92
anyway

5610.159 --> 5615.04
in the steps of columbus right it's

5613.28 --> 5615.5199999999995
isn't that funny kevin horizons even

5615.04 --> 5618.88
though

5615.52 --> 5619.52
columbus there's a lot of propaganda

5618.88 --> 5621.1990000000005
that

5619.52 --> 5622.719
turns out to be like things that are

5621.199 --> 5627.44
definitely

5622.719 --> 5629.84
false disproven historically

5627.44 --> 5632.0
but still yeah you can still learn a lot

5629.84 --> 5635.4400000000005
by just that period you know that

5632.0 --> 5638.96
period of suddenly

5635.44 --> 5641.839999999999
having ships more

5638.96 --> 5642.32
more tr yeah just what was happening was

5641.84 --> 5645.52
very

5642.32 --> 5646.639
interesting in universally like getting

5645.52 --> 5649.92
on a new land

5646.639 --> 5651.1990000000005
a raw land and then getting all these

5649.92 --> 5655.1990000000005
productions and

5651.199 --> 5658.32
farming situations and going

5655.199 --> 5661.36
it's just fascinating

5658.32 --> 5663.679
there's so much that happened like

5661.36 --> 5664.5599999999995
generally happen not specifically

5663.679 --> 5666.88
historically

5664.56 --> 5668.56
significant things yet they of course

5666.88 --> 5671.84
also happen we learn about them

5668.56 --> 5674.88
i learned a lot about this also just

5671.84 --> 5678.400000000001
for talk radio and stuff

5674.88 --> 5680.4800000000005
from america alex jones shared stories

5678.4 --> 5682.719
his guests there share stories all about

5680.48 --> 5682.718999999999
this

5683.119 --> 5689.36
and sometimes they're really detailed

5686.159 --> 5691.36
i had articles written news articles

5689.36 --> 5694.159
especially like 10 years ago when it was

5691.36 --> 5694.159
all really good

5696.239 --> 5701.04
and it was much more digging into that

5698.32 --> 5704.5599999999995
now it's just i've seen it

5701.04 --> 5704.96
most of it it's more complicated now

5704.56 --> 5707.280000000001
that

5704.96 --> 5709.119
flat earth revealed how much is

5707.28 --> 5713.679
basically

5709.119 --> 5717.28
polluted with political influences

5713.679 --> 5718.8
long-term political influences yeah

5717.28 --> 5721.69
anyway i'm rounding out the show man

5718.8 --> 5724.96
