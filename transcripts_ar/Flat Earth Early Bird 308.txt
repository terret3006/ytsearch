was thought like filming it but yeah

107.46 --> 111.27
with my webcam you will barely see

109.77 --> 116.28
anything anyway and it was kind of in

111.27 --> 118.53
the middle of something but yeah there

116.28 --> 120.27
were like literally chemtrails going

118.53 --> 126.209
right in front of the moon and

120.27 --> 133.65
everything so yeah I got Tamera coffee

126.209 --> 139.459

133.65 --> 145.44

139.459 --> 150.89000000000001
first AGM Preston Parker stone monkey 3d

145.44 --> 154.16
a man a young Steve Dell West Watson

150.89 --> 154.16

Steve hmm Aaron maverick right star

160.409 --> 175.56
eASIC dust camel L and we guys are for

167.129 --> 179.939
real indeed it's a lot of back and forth

175.56 --> 184.709
here gray and brown drunken bullet for a

179.939 --> 186.38899999999998
1:1 bandsaw bandit stop a trafficking my

184.709 --> 190.859
rest I had flat out faith

186.389 --> 193.56
the notorious mud okay yeah

190.859 --> 198.239
righteous force I think I got everyone

193.56 --> 201.919
know yeah good to see you all man last

198.239 --> 206.359
night was late was really really late

201.919 --> 211.5
way too late so yeah I got kind of

206.359 --> 213.68900000000002
accidentally on Randy I didn't realize

211.5 --> 223.26
he was life I should have checked before

213.689 --> 225.78
I called him back over Skype yeah but I

223.26 --> 228.959
was there and Adam was there and it was

225.78 --> 232.169
pretty interesting I thought it was

228.959 --> 234.15
really good show and afterward like even

232.169 --> 245.69
after the show ended I kept on talking

234.15 --> 247.73000000000002
at least an hour with Adam and yeah

245.69 --> 254.18
I have something extra to look forward

247.73 --> 256.19
to during the Amsterdam sorry I don't

254.18 --> 260.48
know why but my words seem to be

256.19 --> 266.3
stumbling for some reason it's like out

260.48 --> 268.01
of breath right I have something look

266.3 --> 271.64
forward to look for at the Amsterdam

268.01 --> 274.73
conference because he basically said

271.64 --> 276.56
okay I got a cabin and I got all this

274.73 --> 280.61
room for like three people and you're

276.56 --> 283.22
welcome to stay over there so that way I

280.61 --> 285.11
could basically go there Friday and just

283.22 --> 288.25
stay around I just have to pack a bag

285.11 --> 292.34000000000003
and everything yeah that's pretty cool I

288.25 --> 293.78
really like the idea also that kind of

292.34 --> 295.64
makes it a little bit more easy on me

293.78 --> 299.39
since I then wouldn't have to get up

295.64 --> 303.74
extremely early on Saturday just to get

299.39 --> 305.65999999999997
there kind of in time so yeah that's

303.74 --> 309.31
really awesome thing to look forward to

305.66 --> 309.31
uh so I want to thank Adam for that

309.98 --> 318.02000000000004
[Music]

311.5 --> 321.02
gonna be some good times eh Brenton so

318.02 --> 325.669
yeah do we want to get into the baller

321.02 --> 329.78
stuff that Preston Parker was on earlier

325.669 --> 331.88
he thought he was smart cuz there was a

329.78 --> 334.19
certain constellation that's not visible

331.88 --> 336.32
from the southern hemisphere so I he

334.19 --> 340.13
would would you like to explain that

336.32 --> 342.59
only Flat Earth so I did that basically

340.13 --> 344.12
said okay I don't even need to read that

342.59 --> 346.48999999999995
back really because it's just know this

344.12 --> 350.24
stuff by heart okay so you're not seeing

346.49 --> 353.21000000000004
it because the way the orientation of

350.24 --> 355.34000000000003
the globe of the heavens in relation in

353.21 --> 359.28999999999996
relation to the regions on the earth

355.34 --> 361.46
there's a certain orientation that's

359.29 --> 364.73
consistent data about that

361.46 --> 368.69
so yeah that's why you can see it and

364.73 --> 370.09000000000003
it's yeah I know it's of course starry

368.69 --> 372.52
Jake does

370.09 --> 375.76
that had to basically put it out there I

372.52 --> 384.21999999999997
guess Preston Parker was trying not to

375.76 --> 387.43
say it but then he did it stating but on

384.22 --> 390.94000000000005
the globe it could be behind the curve

387.43 --> 393.01
so yeah that's what you get when you

390.94 --> 395.71
presuppose you're on a spherical earth

393.01 --> 397.78
and the stars are enveloping it yeah

395.71 --> 399.13
then then you can draw that conclusion

397.78 --> 402.90999999999997
that's very nice

399.13 --> 404.98
but yeah on a flat earth it's very

402.91 --> 407.74
simple it's holographic in nature its

404.98 --> 410.29
orientation relates very specifically to

407.74 --> 414.1
the position of the earth and the

410.29 --> 416.17
observer there and it has no no

414.1 --> 418.66
substance concerning any physical

416.17 --> 422.89000000000004
literal positions of these lights at all

418.66 --> 424.39000000000004
I don't presuppose they are at any

422.89 --> 426.76
physical location they're just

424.39 --> 428.89
apparently that they're just apparent

426.76 --> 430.65999999999997
the light are apparent coming from a

428.89 --> 436.24
specific location in relation to the

430.66 --> 442.42
observer and that's it so yeah that's my

436.24 --> 448.47
explanation so we can definitely explain

442.42 --> 448.47
why on a flat earth as you like to say

456.69 --> 464.53
hmm so if there's any more of that huh

463.42 --> 472.69
oh hello by the way

464.53 --> 481.95
oh sure oh six mercury m7 workhorse hana

472.69 --> 481.95
koala quartz yeah lot of new people here

487.029 --> 496.05899999999997
yeah stopping traffic on my rest ahead I

489.309 --> 498.999
kind of agree and to be fair also

496.059 --> 503.04900000000004
reflecting upon that glorious glorious

498.999 --> 505.899
video from Darth which I almost want to

503.049 --> 507.93899999999996
show but I'll probably get copyright

505.899 --> 510.219
strike so if you haven't checked out

507.939 --> 518.979
that video yet I guess I'll post it in

510.219 --> 524.969
chat I put it on the beginning it was so

518.979 --> 524.969
good it's the funniest thing ever ever

525.3 --> 531.1289999999999
so I'm putting it out in chat do check

528.43 --> 535.029
it out it's like a 20 minute sketch I

531.129 --> 537.79
think maybe a little less and it's super

535.029 --> 542.92
compact comedy and so detailed it's just

537.79 --> 548.139
insanely well crafted this guy really

542.92 --> 551.639
really gets the debates incredibly so-so

548.139 --> 554.8290000000001
oh it's 11 men right well it seems like

551.639 --> 557.23
it's just it's so compact and there's so

554.829 --> 559.689
many there's literally multiple jokes

557.23 --> 562.4490000000001
going on at the same time there's

559.689 --> 566.889
audible there's visual there's chat

562.449 --> 570.699
jokes it's super super compact comedy

566.889 --> 572.379
it's amazing every detail has been

570.699 --> 574.709
thought about every detail it's

572.379 --> 584.379
incredible

574.709 --> 585.939
so yeah this guy's an artist I hope he

584.379 --> 592.899
turns out to be a really nice guy

585.939 --> 596.74
overall and yeah I would love to have a

592.899 --> 598.66
chance to have a talk to him like on my

596.74 --> 604.389
show preferably if he could but maybe

598.66 --> 607.18
it's some other hour and but anyway

604.389 --> 608.8
reflecting on that right Bob didn't take

607.18 --> 611.559
the challenge on Randy's right why he's

608.8 --> 615.7589999999999
definitely paying attention because he

611.559 --> 619.149
also commented our greatest thought it

615.759 --> 620.4300000000001
was in that video that he was there in

619.149 --> 626.65
chat

620.43 --> 628.3499999999999
what is it the Bob the the ether guy

626.65 --> 634.0
yeah that was it

628.35 --> 637.1800000000001
so he does pay attention right so he

634.0 --> 641.68
knows he's getting challenged and he's

637.18 --> 643.39
literally ignoring it and probably when

641.68 --> 646.3299999999999
he gets addressed when somebody

643.39 --> 648.9399999999999
addresses him about it or whatever and

646.33 --> 651.6700000000001
ball-busters it's Paul Boston Globe

648.94 --> 653.97
Buster's you probably say what he always

651.67 --> 653.9699999999999
does

660.93 --> 667.8889999999999
I was talking about Bob he commented in

664.8 --> 670.4699999999999
the video just like a lot of other

667.889 --> 674.67
people how funny he thought it was that

670.47 --> 677.339
he was in there and then I I shared that

674.67 --> 679.67
just to reflect that he does pay

677.339 --> 682.0500000000001
attention so he probably knows about

679.67 --> 684.41
goes on at Randy's as well and

682.05 --> 684.41
everything

700.4 --> 704.8

1155.17 --> 1164.25
[ __ ] how do you know that this you

1164.25 --> 1171.72
like if anyone even brings up that

1168.28 --> 1174.94
freaking word in relation to anyone

instantly please I'm so sick of these

1180.28 --> 1187.23
stupid [ __ ] accusations so sick of it

1187.38 --> 1192.6000000000001
now I don't need anyone to give me a

1190.53 --> 1196.6399999999999
chance to explain anything about that

1192.6 --> 1200.1599999999999
sick kind of freaking accusations okay

1196.64 --> 1204.0490000000002
if you got a if you got some proof then

1200.16 --> 1209.45
just post the freaking video or whatever

1204.049 --> 1211.9189999999999
this is just it's just totally wrong and

1209.45 --> 1214.14
besides I did give him a chance to

1211.919 --> 1215.91
explain I didn't abandon him outright I

1214.14 --> 1219.71
almost gave him a minute okay

1215.91 --> 1219.71
told him like now

1228.42 --> 1231.809
[Music]

1244.42 --> 1247.14
all right

1248.35 --> 1256.01
there's seriously no excuse there's no

1251.18 --> 1258.14
excuse to throw that around unless

1256.01 --> 1276.98
somebody's already been convicted okay

1258.14 --> 1282.5900000000001
oh now now president president Parker

1276.98 --> 1285.08
actually didn't say something bad in

1282.59 --> 1286.3999999999999
this case but I don't even know if he

1285.08 --> 1289.1299999999999
was calling me that

1286.4 --> 1294.0500000000002
but just calling anyone that Preston

1289.13 --> 1297.3500000000001
Parker is just unless they are actually

1294.05 --> 1302.3799999999999
provably conflicted all that it's just

1297.35 --> 1305.8999999999999
totally [ __ ] it just creates havoc

1302.38 --> 1308.74
doesn't do anyone any good so that's

1305.9 --> 1308.74
that's why

1322.149 --> 1328.639
right stop trafficking arrests at well

1324.95 --> 1331.8790000000001
this the thing about that is is it's not

1328.639 --> 1334.4599999999998
just evidence you need some you need a

1331.879 --> 1336.4699999999998
real case because if you're gonna put

1334.46 --> 1338.72
that out there is and you're gonna keep

1336.47 --> 1341.749
on doing it either people will think you

1338.72 --> 1345.259
are completely [ __ ] and and

1341.749 --> 1348.98
worthless blab ler like PJ for example

1345.259 --> 1351.109
or they will come after you and you

1348.98 --> 1357.08
better have a good case or you're

1351.109 --> 1359.48
screwed so that's why if you're actually

1357.08 --> 1361.759
gonna say ok this person absolutely

1359.48 --> 1367.009
provably so you better have a damn good

1361.759 --> 1370.6390000000001
case and to approach just spamming oh

1367.009 --> 1372.499
he's a pedo yeah that's the wrong way to

1370.639 --> 1375.529
do that if you got a case you better

1372.499 --> 1379.009
build it and then you can share

1375.529 --> 1382.129
something and you don't say that's what

1379.009 --> 1383.84
retards do no matter the case no matter

1382.129 --> 1387.9989999999998
even if they're right that's what

1383.84 --> 1387.999
retired people do so don't do that

1397.51 --> 1404.6299999999999
in public I mean you know look whatever

1401.12 --> 1409.37
suspicions you have if anyone I get that

1404.63 --> 1412.0900000000001
but that's a rumor stuff and I I care to

1409.37 --> 1416.75
listen to certain rumors of people have

1412.09 --> 1421.1899999999998
but I don't want to just throw that [ __ ]

1416.75 --> 1426.11
out there because it doesn't do anyone

1421.19 --> 1429.1100000000001
any good and when I say this every time

1426.11 --> 1430.1299999999999
I'm literally just trying to heat people

1429.11 --> 1432.29
from themselves

1430.13 --> 1436.8400000000001
and also prevent others from getting

1432.29 --> 1440.05
dragged along with it or stepping away

1436.84 --> 1440.05
what's this

1445.79 --> 1458.53
what yeah that is that is just terrible

1451.52 --> 1461.06
ah Christ I shouldn't have done that I

1458.53 --> 1463.3999999999999
should have done that in the other box

1461.06 --> 1473.29
now that no everything's visible that's

1463.4 --> 1476.5
not good okay

1473.29 --> 1476.5
are they

1481.48 --> 1485.6390000000001
okay how would you know Karen be

1507.54 --> 1515.07
like how many times do you have to tell

1509.88 --> 1518.25
you I know you these people that the

1515.07 --> 1520.29
half attention span of a gnat how many

1518.25 --> 1523.8
times to have to tell everyone the plan

1520.29 --> 1525.57
is to meet Randy at the conference and

1523.8 --> 1528.6599999999999
he said he would hand over the camera

1525.57 --> 1531.02
over there ok how many times do I need

1528.66 --> 1533.7900000000002
to tell everyone

1531.02 --> 1536.12
[ __ ] sake there's no camera coming in

1533.79 --> 1536.12
the mail

1574.32 --> 1586.3799999999999
I don't think surest uh I don't think a

1582.47 --> 1589.89
p900 would fit in his pants you know how

1586.38 --> 1593.66
small Randy is you think that camera

1589.89 --> 1593.66
would fit in that pants with him

1622.58 --> 1627.33
[Music]

1624.33 --> 1627.33
yep

1630.36 --> 1637.2099999999998
right back to flat earth back to

1633.52 --> 1643.87
flutters all right yeah back to what you

1637.21 --> 1647.91
know usually helps when ballers bring

1643.87 --> 1647.9099999999999
out questions like they did at the start

1655.039 --> 1658.519
hello Randy

1669.05 --> 1672.089
[Music]

1672.789 --> 1680.289
no but seriously like okay ap1000 would

1677.27 --> 1682.85
absolutely not fit in anybody's pants

1680.289 --> 1687.41
probably not even in Owen Benjamin's

1682.85 --> 1688.9699999999998
pants but yeah Randy is not that big a

1687.41 --> 1690.8600000000001
guy so a p900

1688.97 --> 1694.07
you know it's it's still kind of a big

1690.86 --> 1698.3799999999999
camera you got to have some oversight

1694.07 --> 1698.3799999999999
pants to fit those in that you know

1711.21 --> 1727.08
universities law depart what an essay

1715.9 --> 1735.97
I've had to what okay I don't know I

1727.08 --> 1739.3899999999999
don't really see the use of it it's the

1735.97 --> 1741.55
thing is for example the looping aspect

1739.39 --> 1745.0300000000002
it would kind of have to be have some

1741.55 --> 1749.53
very substantial foot holding some real

1745.03 --> 1752.92
serious data backed evidence I gotta get

1749.53 --> 1757.12
some things right first before I can

1752.92 --> 1761.26
even basically in my opinion lay lay any

1757.12 --> 1764.29
kind of claim opposing the disk model

1761.26 --> 1767.05
really that has slightly more backing

1764.29 --> 1770.28
also same similar claims but in an

1767.05 --> 1773.11
opposition and that is the equator line

1770.28 --> 1775.6
so I first got to kind of confirm that

1773.11 --> 1783.309
the equator would be a geometrical

1775.6 --> 1786.4599999999998
straight line in order to yeah lay claim

1783.309 --> 1788.559
to a rectangular looping earth although

1786.46 --> 1790.77
yeah I've also proposed that could get

1788.559 --> 1793.33
weirder and that it could be an arc that

1790.77 --> 1796.0
it's not a perfectly straight line but

1793.33 --> 1797.8899999999999
it's not a complete circle either so

1796.0 --> 1804.25
that could be the case but anyway yeah

1797.89 --> 1810.88
the the the curve or missing there off

1804.25 --> 1815.62
of the equator line which would be yeah

1810.88 --> 1817.96
what is it an apparent line relation to

1815.62 --> 1821.82
specific orientation of the globe of the

1817.96 --> 1824.98
heavens and how that line is devised

1821.82 --> 1828.85
that is really the question is it a

1824.98 --> 1830.47
straight line that specific relation of

1828.85 --> 1833.35
the globe of the heavens or its

1830.47 --> 1836.89
orientation to the earth is that a

1833.35 --> 1840.1789999999999
straight line or is it a circle or is it

1836.89 --> 1840.179
an arc

1840.2 --> 1849.1390000000001
so that is the critical data for me I

1844.609 --> 1851.859
need I need that in order to even lay an

1849.139 --> 1855.049
open claim as to the potential of a

1851.859 --> 1858.619
looping aspect you were especially

1855.049 --> 1861.4089999999999
confined realm that is it I die that

1858.619 --> 1863.57
must be done otherwise it would be just

1861.409 --> 1865.73
complete science-fiction and why would

1863.57 --> 1869.299
why the hell would any university look

1865.73 --> 1871.85
at that at this point you know although

1869.299 --> 1873.889
I could what I could potentially do is

1871.85 --> 1876.9189999999999
lay more groundwork for the holographic

1873.889 --> 1879.559
nature of the heavens that will probably

1876.919 --> 1881.8690000000001
have a little bit more viability and I

1879.559 --> 1887.119
do have it conceptualized pretty

1881.869 --> 1889.6
detailed now I think compared to most

1887.119 --> 1889.6
people

1894.42 --> 1908.309
yeah by the way thank you for the

1896.679 --> 1908.3090000000002
moderating Karen B yeah

1936.19 --> 1951.909
Oh Larry the March oh that's so cute you

1948.25 --> 1956.919
are never good evidence fifty equator is

1951.909 --> 1959.1290000000001
anything but a lie around kikyo but love

1956.919 --> 1959.1290000000001
it

1980.029 --> 1990.049
yeah I don't know why but I it it really

1983.549 --> 1990.049
depends on how oh well that's yeah oh

1991.25 --> 1995.809
you know that wasn't gonna happen Trish

2004.899 --> 2007.899
No

2027.03 --> 2030.079
[Music]

2032.56 --> 2038.79
all right yeah that's right David

2035.02 --> 2042.07
Brisbane oh you betcha on that on that

2038.79 --> 2046.6499999999999
exploration tour as to the orientation

2042.07 --> 2049.06
of the apparent equator line which is a

2046.65 --> 2050.65
specific relation to the orientation of

2049.06 --> 2054.0099999999998
the globe of the heavens in relation to

2050.65 --> 2069.4
the earth be carefully figuring that one

2054.01 --> 2071.94
out and God and you don't do that why do

2069.4 --> 2074.79
you always have to aggravate everything

2071.94 --> 2077.86
[ __ ] sake

2074.79 --> 2080.74
sorry I'm getting seriously distracted

2077.86 --> 2083.9190000000003
here anyway

2080.74 --> 2086.2
yes I will when the equator line is

2083.919 --> 2089.47
going to be figured out I will

2086.2 --> 2092.74
definitely be taking a gyroscope problem

2089.47 --> 2095.5499999999997
if I could I'd have like almost like a

2092.74 --> 2100.93
cart with all kinds of science devices

2095.55 --> 2103.54
with me like a gyroscope 24-hour

2100.93 --> 2110.43
spinning gyroscope maybe even laser

2103.54 --> 2113.43
gyroscope a level air pressure I I

2110.43 --> 2119.19
digress

2113.43 --> 2119.19
damn it hydrometer yeah

2119.9 --> 2126.349
it's weird because in the Dutch word it

2122.089 --> 2128.029
is very different but almost the same

2126.349 --> 2130.88
it's very confusing for me to see you

2128.029 --> 2151.72
say it in English I don't know if I got

2130.88 --> 2151.7200000000003
it right it burns us

2159.68 --> 2162.68
yeah

2166.66 --> 2171.52
I'm getting distracted from all sides

2169.37 --> 2174.77
here huh

2171.52 --> 2179.03
right anyway so did David Brisbane did

2174.77 --> 2182.03
make it kind of a good point and yeah I

2179.03 --> 2184.6400000000003
will be if I'm gonna even be personally

2182.03 --> 2189.5800000000004
doing that but a gyroscope should

2184.64 --> 2192.58
definitely be utilized in such exploits

2189.58 --> 2192.58
absolutely

2198.94 --> 2201.539
what

2203.51 --> 2207.4100000000003
Simon Dan really

2218.2 --> 2223.5
but yeah Aaron maverick that's fair

2221.2 --> 2227.9199999999996
really nice and all but Simon Dan is

2223.5 --> 2230.17
refused they even come on my show I

2227.92 --> 2236.55
actually did invite him try to invite

2230.17 --> 2240.4900000000002
him several times and just refuses so

2236.55 --> 2245.5800000000004
yeah and I am NOT going over to his

2240.49 --> 2245.58
shitty channel absolutely not

2255.16 --> 2261.41
josè piss off okay

2259.25 --> 2263.92
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

2261.41 --> 2263.92
talking about

2265.24 --> 2271.6099999999997
seriously I'm getting all kinds of

2269.18 --> 2276.29
disgusting pedo trolls what the hell are

2271.61 --> 2277.67
you talking about okay Jose why don't

2276.29 --> 2280.66
you actually look into the situation

2277.67 --> 2293.81
before you open your blabbering mouth

2280.66 --> 2298.06
dumbass yeah just show a stupid thing

2293.81 --> 2298.06
you said there it's just ridiculous

2318.62 --> 2324.74
I know it it's not about IQ it's about

2322.82 --> 2327.13
paying attention to what's going on and

2324.74 --> 2329.4799999999996
if you're just gonna be say Oh

2327.13 --> 2331.73
somebody's doing it all wrong when they

2329.48 --> 2341.21
are actually doing it all right exactly

2331.73 --> 2343.7
right yeah okay that is goodbye yeah

2341.21 --> 2344.96
okay I'm getting troll attacked right so

2343.7 --> 2348.3199999999997
it's not funny

2344.96 --> 2349.91
when Karen B is actually helping me fix

2348.32 --> 2357.8300000000004
that [ __ ] right here

2349.91 --> 2361.8199999999997
so no trace of life I did that because

2357.83 --> 2365.99
you were you were doing you were doing

2361.82 --> 2367.6000000000004
Jason the nagging shady dumb concave

2365.99 --> 2370.85
troll a favor

2367.6 --> 2373.91
but seeing free him yeah that that gives

2370.85 --> 2375.77
you a timeout anyone doing that will be

2373.91 --> 2377.54
timed out and if it's actually Jason

2375.77 --> 2379.85
with some sock account he will be banned

2377.54 --> 2383.38
and I'll keep doing that until the end

2379.85 --> 2389.06
of time because that guy is beyond

2383.38 --> 2393.37
repulsive I hate him he has nothing to

2389.06 --> 2393.37
bring nothing it's a waste of time

2395.89 --> 2402.77
doesn't even have any arguments any at

2399.62 --> 2409.97
all like don has more arguments for his

2402.77 --> 2412.46
globe belief then this guy okay so no

2409.97 --> 2415.27
free no free Jason it's not gonna have

2412.46 --> 2415.27
it's not gonna happen

2419.23 --> 2426.32
if he wants freedom did do his own Daily

2424.01 --> 2460.099
Show see how many people care about what

2426.32 --> 2463.3900000000003
he has to say gotta be kidding me Wow my

2460.099 --> 2463.3900000000003
chat is messy today

2487.89 --> 2492.8799999999997
all right oh yeah by the way I thought

2490.75 --> 2494.56
it was kind of interesting yesterday on

2492.88 --> 2498.88
the debates with mind-warped and you

2494.56 --> 2504.34
yeah also mine worked on my channel was

2498.88 --> 2509.26
weird although he I think he's an

2504.34 --> 2512.23
awesome guy so far at least but I don't

2509.26 --> 2518.67
know he does have like a weird it's not

2512.23 --> 2518.67
bad but a slight sivanna a response to

2518.82 --> 2526.63
do QE now he does that to a lot of

2522.13 --> 2529.48
people not more than right the hand as

2526.63 --> 2531.21
you all know how he gets that's just

2529.48 --> 2534.34
total savanna out

2531.21 --> 2538.03
Suhani a blowout but mind-warped has

2534.34 --> 2543.25
some issues as well and he should you

2538.03 --> 2547.1800000000003
should do something about that because

2543.25 --> 2550.599
it's really no use to go on personal

2547.18 --> 2554.2799999999997
attacks against John because of his

2550.599 --> 2557.23
inability to not do that I don't know

2554.28 --> 2559.2900000000004
I've I've done that it's just a waste of

2557.23 --> 2559.29
time

2570.26 --> 2573.98
panfish guy what

2582.95 --> 2591.5589999999997
at the equator ooh Wow

2588.25 --> 2594.38
okay that's that's fascinating Preston

2591.559 --> 2596.299
Parker I want to I want to get to this

2594.38 --> 2600.38
specifically here okay that is

2596.299 --> 2604.97
absolutely fascinating so how does that

2600.38 --> 2607.79
proof the earth is rotating if the ball

2604.97 --> 2612.1699999999996
spinning right it's spinning like this

2607.79 --> 2615.589
right so how it's a gyroscope rotating

2612.17 --> 2619.01
little bits on the equator it's proof

2615.589 --> 2624.98
that the ball is spinning how does it

2619.01 --> 2628.42
prove that Preston Parker does it make a

2624.98 --> 2628.42
whole lot of sense now does it

2651.94 --> 2654.96
damn dudes

2661.19 --> 2667.7000000000003
now no Jose that was just you were just

2663.98 --> 2668.63
being dumb and don't get here with your

2667.7 --> 2671.5989999999997
socks okay

2668.63 --> 2673.52
look wait you didn't ban his main

2671.599 --> 2676.73
account right because I didn't want that

2673.52 --> 2680.569
banned I don't I Danny sucks but not his

2676.73 --> 2686.049
main account I just want him to stop his

2680.569 --> 2686.049
[ __ ] because he was wrong and that's all

2687.88 --> 2700.579
right good okay

2690.349 --> 2702.44
then it's fine I don't know why

2700.579 --> 2704.7400000000002
everybody always has to turn my chat

2702.44 --> 2708.88
into some kind of Jerry Springer Show

2704.74 --> 2708.8799999999997
don't know what what that's about

2721.37 --> 2725.35
the Preston Mike

2728.49 --> 2738.64
how how does a 15 degree per hour drift

2735.48 --> 2742.2
perpendicular to the presupposed center

2738.64 --> 2745.95
of the sphere earth at the equator prove

2742.2 --> 2751.24
the axial rotation from north to south

2745.95 --> 2754.45
pole on that axis how does the 15 degree

2751.24 --> 2756.3399999999997
per hour drift perpendicular to the

2754.45 --> 2758.71
center point of the presupposed earth at

2756.34 --> 2761.8900000000003
the equator proof the earth is rotating

2758.71 --> 2767.46
around the axis from north to south that

2761.89 --> 2767.46
doesn't make any sense hello

2778.85 --> 2785.44
this doesn't even seem worth worth

2781.52 --> 2785.44
getting angry over at this one come on

2785.53 --> 2791.9300000000003
why Wow

2789.29 --> 2795.56
do you know even what gyroscopes are

2791.93 --> 2798.44
supposedly proving okay do you know what

2795.56 --> 2800.45
so unique about a gyroscope in order to

2798.44 --> 2802.46
prove some kind of orientation do you

2800.45 --> 2806.87
know why do you know why a gyroscope

2802.46 --> 2808.4900000000002
does that I have no problem explaining

2806.87 --> 2811.0699999999997
that to you right okay so what

2808.49 --> 2813.7099999999996
originally was thought out to bite the

2811.07 --> 2815.3
gyroscope why it's used in planes and

2813.71 --> 2817.07
ships and everything as in the

2815.3 --> 2820.4500000000003
orientation devices because when it's

2817.07 --> 2823.82
something is spinning without friction

2820.45 --> 2826.04
the momentum of the spin keeps it in

2823.82 --> 2828.29
place no matter the orientation so it

2826.04 --> 2830.27
keeps spinning and something everything

2828.29 --> 2832.46
around it could move it'll still stay in

2830.27 --> 2835.1
its exact orientation because of the

2832.46 --> 2839.48
spin right and that's with physical

2835.1 --> 2841.37
gyroscopes that's the idea so then it

2839.48 --> 2844.73
was conceptualized oh look if you go

2841.37 --> 2848.5099999999998
around the globe then the physical

2844.73 --> 2853.67
gyroscope will as you go over the curve

2848.51 --> 2856.1000000000004
it will slant with you because it will

2853.67 --> 2858.32
stay in its exact orientation its

2856.1 --> 2860.99
geometrical literal orientation that's

2858.32 --> 2863.7200000000003
why that's supposed to be there right so

2860.99 --> 2865.9399999999996
if a ring laser gyroscope

2863.72 --> 2870.49
which is not physical based but light

2865.94 --> 2874.28
based if it rotates 15 degree

2870.49 --> 2876.5899999999997
perpendicular to down or the presupposed

2874.28 --> 2882.53
axis of this center of the sphere earth

2876.59 --> 2886.58
right at the equator which is this mode

2882.53 --> 2889.01
how does with this motion in a

2886.58 --> 2895.7
geometrical orientation right on top of

2889.01 --> 2901.7000000000003
this how is it doing a 15 degrees per

2895.7 --> 2906.91
hour circle like this prove this kind of

2901.7 --> 2909.1099999999997
motion that doesn't make any sense

2906.91 --> 2913.66
hello-hello

2909.11 --> 2913.6600000000003
I mean getting through yet

2913.84 --> 2924.8
please please get it please it's not you

2921.89 --> 2929.08
seem really really confused about what

2924.8 --> 2929.0800000000004
gyroscopes are even supposedly proving

2937.65 --> 2940.699
[Music]

2944.41 --> 2949.1499999999996
man Garren you really got your work cut

2947.36 --> 2951.9500000000003
out for you

2949.15 --> 2958.4900000000002
Amanda young if you could assist Karen B

2951.95 --> 2960.5
that would be nice because there's a lot

2958.49 --> 2963.49
of trolls out there they're really

2960.5 --> 2963.49
trying to slip it in

2977.72 --> 2984.5899999999997
now that's not true hmm yeah Jose does

2982.22 --> 2988.1899999999996
have a favor that's why I didn't ban him

2984.59 --> 2990.29
outright okay but he was wrong I just

2988.19 --> 2993.5
gave him a time timeout what's the

2990.29 --> 2995.69
problem it was really stupid accusation

2993.5 --> 2998.81
and Karen B is was kind of in the middle

2995.69 --> 3003.9700000000003
of working helping me out with my chat

2998.81 --> 3006.22
here so I kind of took the initiative

3003.97 --> 3009.37
and just put him in his place for a

3006.22 --> 3012.3999999999996
moment but he still has my favor I know

3009.37 --> 3017.41
if he treats me very nice on the show

3012.4 --> 3019.3
and you know he can be a little cheeky

3017.41 --> 3022.83
if he wants but he can't be blatantly

3019.3 --> 3026.46
wrong and poking at the wrong people

3022.83 --> 3026.46
that's the difference

3027.65 --> 3030.789
[Music]

3034.13 --> 3037.449
[Music]

3046.01 --> 3048.88
right

3051.26 --> 3054.1000000000004
Wow

3057.94 --> 3072.819
our LG wave interference better its

3061.93 --> 3078.549
throat it what kind of look people now

3072.819 --> 3080.5
that now that is techno babble okay can

3078.549 --> 3084.7889999999998
you see me highlighting that can you see

3080.5 --> 3086.14
it now that is techno babble okay let me

3084.789 --> 3090.789
read that out for a moment

3086.14 --> 3094.0299999999997
from David Brisbane Darwin with the rlg

3090.789 --> 3096.3390000000004
some kind of device I presume scanning

3094.03 --> 3099.579
device it is measuring wave interference

3096.339 --> 3102.94
patterns if the earth is rotating the

3099.579 --> 3108.9900000000002
laser light travels slightly farther in

3102.94 --> 3112.619
one direction than another really why

3108.99 --> 3115.9599999999996
why would I do that

3112.619 --> 3120.52
really that doesn't make any damn sense

3115.96 --> 3124.45
and besides another direction you're

3120.52 --> 3128.68
kind of freaking in which direction it's

3124.45 --> 3131.3799999999997
doing that it's not the crater the giant

3128.68 --> 3135.819
laser gyro is not rotating like this no

3131.38 --> 3139.9500000000003
it's not rotating like this yes

3135.819 --> 3139.95
forgot to mention that now did yet

3141.2 --> 3155.31
all right okay all right sorry I didn't

3146.1 --> 3158.5499999999997
see that is this yet another doublethink

3155.31 --> 3160.86
thing is this now the new thing you're

3158.55 --> 3164.15
gonna have you're enforcing the double

3160.86 --> 3167.34
thing in how the ring laser gyroscope

3164.15 --> 3170.87
supposedly proves the orientation of a

3167.34 --> 3173.4300000000003
presupposed globe earth when it rotates

3170.87 --> 3176.5499999999997
perpendicular to the exact presupposed

3173.43 --> 3177.99
center point of that globe earth even

3176.55 --> 3180.15
when you're not at the North or South

3177.99 --> 3186.6899999999996
South Pole that makes no sense it makes

3180.15 --> 3191.67
no sense guys it is total idiocy makes

3186.69 --> 3194.04
no sense to think that it doesn't prove

3191.67 --> 3197.1800000000003
a globe it's literally a technobabble

3194.04 --> 3199.95
mind fart it's it's nonsense you can't

3197.18 --> 3202.0499999999997
be serious with that you can't be

3199.95 --> 3206.48
seriously thinking that that proves

3202.05 --> 3206.48
anything [ __ ] sake

3227.72 --> 3240.4399999999996
I I disagree but I agreed that Trish

3237.47 --> 3243.49
Blythe that you definitely do seem to

3240.44 --> 3243.4900000000002
think that you're funny

3276.26 --> 3285.869
okay well if you mean that you haven't

3281.069 --> 3289.049
actually feel tested your funny value

3285.869 --> 3291.42
and had some genuine inquiries to people

3289.049 --> 3294.779
as to like am I really funny what do you

3291.42 --> 3298.46
think about me instead of just stating

3294.779 --> 3300.869
it just accepting it because you said it

3298.46 --> 3303.27
then yeah if you like to compare that

3300.869 --> 3306.9300000000003
with me not having recently done an IQ

3303.27 --> 3307.559
test but presuming that I could be 260

3306.93 --> 3309.69
yeah

3307.559 --> 3316.6400000000003
in that case yeah you are definitely

3309.69 --> 3316.64
funny on the same level absolutely

3320.94 --> 3324.01
[Music]

3328.46 --> 3336.0
all right now that's fine crisp life and

3332.31 --> 3337.7999999999997
I'm calling your [ __ ]

3336.0 --> 3342.45
you're not funny I don't think you're

3337.8 --> 3347.28
funny well you've made a funny joke like

3342.45 --> 3349.7999999999997
once or twice but ya must at a time you

3347.28 --> 3351.9300000000003
kind of ruin it by saying things and

3349.8 --> 3356.9700000000003
then just presuming you're funny

3351.93 --> 3360.8399999999997
and I don't know I I'm not really amused

3356.97 --> 3364.5899999999997
by that at all doesn't get to me you

3360.84 --> 3383.9900000000002
know real fun real humor has to get to

3364.59 --> 3388.29
you then it's funny well Randy I I

3383.99 --> 3390.2999999999997
talked about it yesterday as I think

3388.29 --> 3397.11
that my IQ score could vary greatly

3390.3 --> 3399.8
depending on the circumstances but in

3397.11 --> 3408.84
the past I've been tested and it said

3399.8 --> 3416.57
that I was was it hundred and sixty I

3408.84 --> 3422.1000000000004
think was 140 somewhere no what was that

3416.57 --> 3426.09
it was pretty damn high what

3422.1 --> 3431.5499999999997
right but that was basically before the

3426.09 --> 3434.9700000000003
time where let's just say that's pretty

3431.55 --> 3439.59
in time okay it was the really early

3434.97 --> 3442.5
test before I got all the [ __ ] on my

3439.59 --> 3446.4300000000003
back and my feeling screwing me over and

3442.5 --> 3448.23
all that [ __ ] so yeah I was by my

3446.43 --> 3450.66
parent's at least they really were kind

3448.23 --> 3453.05
of bragging how freaking smart I was and

3450.66 --> 3457.74
the same goes by the way for my brother

3453.05 --> 3461.8500000000004
because he he's well i qy z he was even

3457.74 --> 3468.8999999999996
smarter than me also had more feelings

3461.85 --> 3471.75
issues by the way but yeah i that's well

3468.9 --> 3474.33
that's 30 years ago something like that

3471.75 --> 3479.43
so i I haven't done anything recently

3474.33 --> 3481.5
and I don't think I'm as fluid and quick

3479.43 --> 3484.9199999999996
as I used to be when I was young even

3481.5 --> 3487.83
though I still have that mechanism of

3484.92 --> 3489.57
how I did that and I'm trying to retain

3487.83 --> 3491.73
it basically but yeah at the same time I

3489.57 --> 3496.7400000000002
got damaged I'm growing a little older

3491.73 --> 3500.22
that literally slows you down so but I

3496.74 --> 3504.18
think that I would probably be on a

3500.22 --> 3507.9599999999996
regular day hundred forty and if I'm

3504.18 --> 3512.52
really good and really focused 160

3507.96 --> 3514.92
probably could peek at that but anyway

3512.52 --> 3517.86
that's just the IQ it's not the EQ or

3514.92 --> 3521.2200000000003
anything related to that it's just the

3517.86 --> 3526.88
the quick compactness potential of my

3521.22 --> 3529.8799999999997
mental axe that's it all right that's

3526.88 --> 3529.88
cool

3530.97 --> 3539.6699999999996
yeah 120 is great you know

3535.119 --> 3544.539
as for look as for what you need IQ wise

3539.67 --> 3548.2000000000003
to be successful in society you really

3544.539 --> 3550.509
don't need to be all that intelligent to

3548.2 --> 3557.68
still be able to get with 120 you can be

3550.509 --> 3560.529
a great success so you know at the same

3557.68 --> 3562.48
time there are very smart people out

3560.529 --> 3565.66
there as well that well you don't know

3562.48 --> 3567.67
these people but that are just riddled

3565.66 --> 3570.94
with problems and that are not

3567.67 --> 3574.509
successful in society at all but they

3570.94 --> 3577.23
are really smart but that smartness has

3574.509 --> 3580.38
basically just taken control over them

3577.23 --> 3589.42
instead of the other way around

3580.38 --> 3595.359
right that would be sure it is Oh Trish

3589.42 --> 3600.33
life yeah well you are not and never

3595.359 --> 3603.429
have been funny how about that

3600.33 --> 3603.429
[Music]

3607.29 --> 3616.15
[Music]

3616.2 --> 3619.2
right

3626.51 --> 3632.63
yeah by the way to compare that like an

3630.38 --> 3637.07
IQ test and for example other things

3632.63 --> 3639.62
when there was a way really weird thing

3637.07 --> 3642.86
when I was still when I went it was in

3639.62 --> 3646.7599999999998
that transition phase from being preteen

3642.86 --> 3650.75
into a teenager no way it was even

3646.76 --> 3653.75
before that I was kind of smart but I

3650.75 --> 3655.43
was terrible communicating so some of

3653.75 --> 3657.8
the teachers just didn't know how to

3655.43 --> 3660.5
deal with me and they really genuinely

3657.8 --> 3664.46
thought I was kind of stupid because I

3660.5 --> 3666.8
was just too distracted and disruptive

3664.46 --> 3669.8
sometimes because of it couldn't we had

3666.8 --> 3672.5600000000004
mood swings all that not too bad but

3669.8 --> 3677.21
still there you know couldn't really

3672.56 --> 3679.91
stay still easily and they thought I was

3677.21 --> 3681.26
really dumb and yeah when my parents

3679.91 --> 3684.29
found out that they would actually

3681.26 --> 3686.63
recommend to send me to a [ __ ] school

3684.29 --> 3689.23
I'm serious they were totally outraged

3686.63 --> 3692.57
and pissed off like yeah screw you guys

3689.23 --> 3694.46
and by the way that school laid that

3692.57 --> 3697.61
literal director that made that decision

3694.46 --> 3699.11
he later got like is serious lawsuit

3697.61 --> 3701.6600000000003
even because there was a lot more wrong

3699.11 --> 3703.9700000000003
in that school some weird [ __ ] going on

3701.66 --> 3706.85
I'm not saying there was like disgusting

3703.97 --> 3710.6899999999996
[ __ ] but there was it was just weird the

3706.85 --> 3713.62
guy was weird and he had issues I don't

3710.69 --> 3717.5
know exactly in retrospect what it was

3713.62 --> 3719.5099999999998
but I at that school yeah like God got

3717.5 --> 3722.81
away from that and then I got to a

3719.51 --> 3724.6400000000003
Rudolf Steiner school and that the

3722.81 --> 3726.86
culture over there just shocked me was

3724.64 --> 3729.65
such a contrast with my kind of liberal

3726.86 --> 3735.6800000000003
based culture from home that yeah that

3729.65 --> 3737.75
caused all kinds of issues but I never

3735.68 --> 3742.2999999999997
really even got to and I cute it was

3737.75 --> 3747.86
also not relevant there and I think

3742.3 --> 3753.05
later when I was like 11 I think I did I

3747.86 --> 3758.15
just scored really great on unlike tests

3753.05 --> 3760.069
or like where can you go but yeah I

3758.15 --> 3762.559
could have basically

3760.069 --> 3766.369
chosen for a more high and what is it

3762.559 --> 3767.989
say Mayo what they call for the manure

3766.369 --> 3770.589
eyeing to aim for university to have to

3767.989 --> 3773.329
study but it was like mandated to have

3770.589 --> 3777.44
four languages in there and I was like

3773.329 --> 3779.569
oh my god please please no so the

3777.44 --> 3781.94
prospect of that just scared the [ __ ]

3779.569 --> 3782.719
out of me so I decided for something

3781.94 --> 3788.109
more simple

3782.719 --> 3793.7290000000003
half of which is it's still fine

3788.109 --> 3796.16
it's still challenging but yeah a lot

3793.729 --> 3799.609
more limited in the package that I got

3796.16 --> 3801.859
and I only had to take English and Dutch

3799.609 --> 3805.069
and that was a great relief to me

3801.859 --> 3807.89
because was just not enthusiastic about

3805.069 --> 3811.19
learning the other languages at all but

3807.89 --> 3815.92
I yeah I scored pretty well well enough

3811.19 --> 3818.949
to go there but also I was already

3815.92 --> 3822.38
trying to yeah in the early days when I

3818.949 --> 3826.279
didn't I had a lot of raucous on the on

3822.38 --> 3828.0190000000002
the school before that the where the

3826.279 --> 3830.9
world of Steiner principles were uphold

3828.019 --> 3833.779
it was really a good school but I kind

3830.9 --> 3835.789
of the frequency just mismatched a lot

3833.779 --> 3839.18
and I kind of got into a very sick

3835.789 --> 3841.4300000000003
oppositional defiance position there in

3839.18 --> 3843.3489999999997
general and it traumatized me also

3841.43 --> 3847.3999999999996
greatly yeah that was the place where

3843.349 --> 3849.829
like the entire school like 30 40 people

3847.4 --> 3853.069
would like openly scoff at me and bully

3849.829 --> 3855.199
me was terrible and when I got to the

3853.069 --> 3856.219
new school that that situation was not

3855.199 --> 3858.319
there at all

3856.219 --> 3860.69
there was no bullying going on

3858.319 --> 3863.989
absolutely not but it was still just

3860.69 --> 3866.93
like getting over it was still paranoid

3863.989 --> 3869.9
against everyone and that also burdened

3866.93 --> 3873.3489999999997
my overall ability to just relax and

3869.9 --> 3878.44
focus so I could have probably scored

3873.349 --> 3878.44
higher back then even than I did

3881.28 --> 3884.429
[Music]

3896.29 --> 3901.47
[Music]

3898.849 --> 3909.0
what the hell are you talking about Juan

3901.47 --> 3913.769
Carlos really you think all of that was

3909.0 --> 3916.41
lies that is such a huge insult man you

3913.769 --> 3923.49
think I told all this that was just a

3916.41 --> 3925.68
made-up story really you think I why

3923.49 --> 3928.2889999999998
would I why the hell would I do put a

3925.68 --> 3931.049
story out that and basically with such

3928.289 --> 3934.559
details and then later risk terrible

3931.049 --> 3936.569
terrible inconsistencies because that's

3934.559 --> 3940.549
what happens when you tell very detailed

3936.569 --> 3940.549
elaborate lies that's ridiculous

3954.86 --> 3957.86
right

3975.47 --> 3982.1099999999997
no no mercury m7 that would be terrible

3980.01 --> 3984.48
I already responded to this I can't

3982.11 --> 3987.84
believe you guys are literally rolling

3984.48 --> 3990.12
out the same tapestry of trolling again

3987.84 --> 3996.15
exactly the same thing as two days ago

3990.12 --> 4000.38
or three days ago it's ridiculous not

3996.15 --> 4007.2200000000003
gonna do a public IQ test that's gonna

4000.38 --> 4009.8
strain me way too much I'd be nervous as

4007.22 --> 4019.37
hell and extremely distracted it's not

4009.8 --> 4021.8300000000004
gonna do it any good besides it why

4019.37 --> 4024.5899999999997
would I care you know look if it's gonna

4021.83 --> 4027.89
be critical for something you know if

4024.59 --> 4030.3500000000004
I'd apply to a university god knows for

4027.89 --> 4032.45
what reason okay yeah then I might have

4030.35 --> 4034.25
to do that or something and sure I'll do

4032.45 --> 4037.79
it and I'll publish the results that's

4034.25 --> 4040.67
fine but to be fair I don't exactly plan

4037.79 --> 4043.27
to go to a university anytime soon if

4040.67 --> 4043.27
you know what I mean

4064.2 --> 4069.9399999999996
anyway I'm gonna round out this just a

4066.91 --> 4074.56
giant mess here and chat nothing coming

4069.94 --> 4076.6
out of this mutt rollin stupid IQ test

4074.56 --> 4080.41
nonsense what does that have to do with

4076.6 --> 4083.08
Flat Earth anyway you know why would you

4080.41 --> 4085.8399999999997
need some stupid little tests when

4083.08 --> 4087.5499999999997
people basically show their level every

4085.84 --> 4090.1000000000004
time they open their mouth or they write

4087.55 --> 4094.03
something down or respond to anything

4090.1 --> 4096.97
literally that reveals what level people

4094.03 --> 4101.92
are at what background knowledge they

4096.97 --> 4104.56
have what frequency they apply how wise

4101.92 --> 4106.6
they tend to be and if you take it over

4104.56 --> 4108.700000000001
time you can even see their growth and

4106.6 --> 4110.589
development cycle and that's a much

4108.7 --> 4114.429999999999
better judge of character than a freakin

4110.589 --> 4116.859
IQ test so many people could potentially

4114.43 --> 4119.89
have a hundred 80 IQ and they'll stay

4116.859 --> 4121.950000000001
retards their entire lives being really

4119.89 --> 4132.31
fast calculators and piss-poor

4121.95 --> 4134.98
socializers so whoop-dee-doo anyway I'm

4132.31 --> 4137.14
gonna run out the show so if you liked

4134.98 --> 4138.879999999999
