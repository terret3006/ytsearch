1.83 --> 11.879
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

7.06 --> 16.18
birds number 13 I'm your host Arwen and

11.879 --> 17.75
today I have a guest with me Travis

16.18 --> 20.78
hello Travis

17.75 --> 20.78
[Music]

21.36 --> 29.52
good to have you here

24.81 --> 29.52
so how's the weather out there

33.329 --> 41.829
yep yep how is the weather out there

38.609 --> 45.690000000000005
alright so it's overcast clouds it

41.829 --> 48.42
rained last night a little bit so

45.69 --> 51.309
not too cold

48.42 --> 52.989000000000004
it's chilly it's chilly when I woke up

51.309 --> 54.788999999999994
this morning and took out the trash I

52.989 --> 58.26
didn't have to have my jacket on

54.789 --> 60.370000000000005
immediately so it wasn't that bad I

58.26 --> 61.748999999999995
was surprised I actually thought that

60.37 --> 63.608999999999995
when I was going to the trash I was like

61.749 --> 65.61
and this is the late November it's not

63.609 --> 68.95
that cold right now hmm

65.61 --> 71.95
alright I'm lucky you now over here it's

68.95 --> 73.81
really freakin cold it's not technically

71.95 --> 75.36
freezing but it's like one degrees

73.81 --> 77.59
Celsius and at that temperature

75.36 --> 81.009
especially in the Netherlands where it's

77.59 --> 84.399
usually very moist becomes bitter bitter

81.009 --> 87.49
cold because yeah the water in the air

84.399 --> 90.1
is not freezing but it is very cold and

87.49 --> 92.439
it will be because it's in the air be

90.1 --> 97.649
able to substract a lot of heat from

92.439 --> 97.64899999999999
everything so everybody is just freezing

102.03 --> 106.45
yep and when that happened that's love

105.009 --> 108.28
better because you don't freeze this

106.45 --> 111.64
much unless you don't wear gloves and

108.28 --> 113.71000000000001
such but it will become really dry all

111.64 --> 116.18900000000001
of a sudden everything gets static

113.71 --> 119.859
shocks and all that crap but

116.189 --> 122.28999999999999
I don't like this then nobody here likes

119.859 --> 125.38
yeah

122.29 --> 126.64
yeah it's it's a nice temperature to

125.38 --> 129.26999999999998
visit but I wouldn't want to live there

126.64 --> 129.27
yeah

130.74 --> 138.57000000000002
so let's see thank you everyone for

134.02 --> 138.57000000000002
coming it's using chat Nesta

138.72 --> 146.16
Ross is here yeah in chat he's up early

143.41 --> 149.67
no I'm very late usually

146.16 --> 156.69
or he's up late usually late

149.67 --> 156.69
Nicholas at GTV LV hello Shane hemlock

157.65 --> 162.93
well trustus weird mood

165.6 --> 169.10999999999999
but yeah

171.319 --> 177.48
what have you been up to well I just got

174.959 --> 180.299
back from my trip out west to the

177.48 --> 182.17999999999998
conference so I've been back since

180.299 --> 184.37
Sunday and

182.18 --> 186.51000000000002
got back on the work

184.37 --> 187.969
go back on the work schedule yesterday

186.51 --> 191.939
but

187.969 --> 194.659
yeah I'm just trying to continue to

191.939 --> 196.82899999999998
think through stuff that's

194.659 --> 197.989
mulling in the back of my mind in terms

196.829 --> 200.42000000000002
of how to

197.989 --> 203.129
approach things that wrote an article

200.42 --> 206.629
the other night I put it in the chat

203.129 --> 210.17999999999998
we're not than the Skyped threads

206.629 --> 212.689
then I'm thinking about submitting to

210.18 --> 215.84900000000002
the local newspapers we've got small

212.689 --> 217.849
city newspapers and then large Baltimore

215.849 --> 220.319
Sun and

217.849 --> 220.879
community colleges so I thought I would

220.319 --> 224.42999999999998
just

220.879 --> 229.709
send it out and see what happens with if

224.43 --> 231.239
it gets printed or ignored so I put that

229.709 --> 233.43
in just to get some feedback in terms of

231.239 --> 234.93
anything that I can clear clear up with

233.43 --> 236.459
my article but I think it's pretty

234.93 --> 239.729
straightforward I try to keep it as

236.459 --> 242.69
terse as possible cool well where were

239.729 --> 242.69000000000003
you gonna post it I

244.04 --> 249.13899999999998
had a phone I had a phone call come in

246.54 --> 252.989
so I got shut up for a second

249.139 --> 253.90900000000002
right where were you gonna submit the

252.989 --> 256.32
article

253.909 --> 259.109
well the Baltimore Sun is the largest

256.32 --> 260.269
paper in my area and then there are

259.109 --> 263.789
smaller

260.269 --> 266.55
community papers that I'm gonna try to

263.789 --> 268.25
see if I can just send two and see if

266.55 --> 271.8
they'll put it in and

268.25 --> 274.199
even it goes in the back page yeah well

271.8 --> 278.07
it's the way to go do it locally there's

274.199 --> 282.33000000000004
usually not a lot of obstacles compared

278.07 --> 283.699
to national level things and then then

282.33 --> 286.46999999999997
you have all of the

283.699 --> 288.62
local coffee shops and whatnot usually

286.47 --> 291.59000000000003
have available or a

288.62 --> 295.5
corkboard where people put some

291.59 --> 297.17999999999995
missing cats and job opportunities and

295.5 --> 301.2
if I could just put the article up there

297.18 --> 304.81
and missing globe Canyon yeah yeah

301.2 --> 307.17
curvature have you seen have you seen my

304.81 --> 307.17
curves

307.26 --> 312.15999999999997
yeah

309.99 --> 315.19
hilarious like in the missing section

312.16 --> 318.24
have you seen yeah that's it have you

315.19 --> 322.5
found my glow yeah take out little

318.24 --> 324.58
classifieds creative classifieds

322.5 --> 326.02
you know because you got those you've

324.58 --> 327.96999999999997
got those people that are just sitting

326.02 --> 329.62
in their apartments all alone just

327.97 --> 331.54
reading everything including the

329.62 --> 334.11
classifieds somebody's going to come

331.54 --> 334.11
across it

335.34 --> 341.91999999999996
yeah it's a good initiative like it it's

340.03 --> 343.97999999999996
funny if you get some feedback from

341.92 --> 348.39000000000004
people that actually have read it

343.98 --> 348.39000000000004
approach yeah cool yeah

349.75 --> 352.35
nice

357.0 --> 360.54
and I talk about

361.98 --> 368.23
yeah the early word yesterday

365.59 --> 372.96
William was on and he was talking a lot

368.23 --> 377.16
in detail also reading out a

372.96 --> 380.21999999999997
lot of optics related physics

377.16 --> 382.84000000000003
information that he was looking into and

380.22 --> 385.02000000000004
yeah there was he has terrible

382.84 --> 388.78
connection problems so

385.02 --> 390.25
it's even up to agitating levels and

388.78 --> 392.08
it's really not his fault it's just the

390.25 --> 393.28
connection sucks so badly so every time

392.08 --> 394.99
he talks even though it's really

393.28 --> 397.33
interesting I know it's interesting what

394.99 --> 400.6
he's saying but you can I could barely

397.33 --> 403.38
hear it at times but he is working on

400.6 --> 406.15000000000003
actual video presentations

403.38 --> 408.94
that will not have the intimate

406.15 --> 411.01
connection problems of course that he's

408.94 --> 414.49
been working on so he said for a week

411.01 --> 418.53999999999996
now so he said should be finished

414.49 --> 420.82
anytime soon and he will probably then

418.54 --> 424.15000000000003
post it on this channel and present it

420.82 --> 427.56
and love to see that because very

424.15 --> 431.09999999999997
promising it's just education

427.56 --> 433.69
really good and we need that

431.1 --> 435.24
we don't need bad internet connections

433.69 --> 439.95
or

435.24 --> 439.95
and a live show that just sucks

440.37 --> 444.72
but I can't wait to see that

445.53 --> 449.15999999999997
looking forward to it

452.389 --> 456.899
one of the things that I thought of over

454.649 --> 459.019
the weekend at the at the conferences

456.899 --> 461.999
people were talking was

459.019 --> 464.42900000000003
maybe some kind of hot air balloon

461.999 --> 466.639
observation where you've got a large you

464.429 --> 469.229
can do an X and y-axis

466.639 --> 471.959
observation so if you start out at the

469.229 --> 475.93899999999996
same location as a hot air balloon and

471.959 --> 478.199
then drive away filming the entire time

475.939 --> 479.969
until you can't see the hot air

478.199 --> 482.459
ballooning any longer right so you've

479.969 --> 484.679
got that whole angle of incidence mm-hmm

482.459 --> 487.039
so then once you can't see it you've

484.679 --> 488.74899999999997
stopped driving and then you have the

487.039 --> 491.429
pilot

488.749 --> 493.769
elevate the balloon and so you can see

491.429 --> 495.979
it and then you can just continue to

493.769 --> 499.73900000000003
incrementally

495.979 --> 501.539
move away from and observe so that you

499.739 --> 504.35999999999996
can finally I suppose to a certain

501.539 --> 506.86899999999997
extent have your delusion to the

504.36 --> 508.97900000000004
obstruction rate yeah yeah you would see

506.869 --> 511.019
yeah you would see that as well right

508.979 --> 512.759
that's that's part of the idea but then

511.019 --> 513.839
the other idea is that at its some

512.759 --> 517.019
certain point again we're gonna

513.839 --> 521.5690000000001
challenge the whole the whole one degree

517.019 --> 525.48
issue of curvature because at some point

521.569 --> 527.37
the balloon is not going to be at ninety

525.48 --> 529.85
degrees any longer it's going to have to

527.37 --> 533.37
be at that angle

529.85 --> 535.0500000000001
if I have to it's going to and so in

533.37 --> 537.8
that if you all see the obstruction rate

535.05 --> 540.4799999999999
should be cumulative it's not

537.8 --> 543.3
an already pretty much figured it out

540.48 --> 546.9590000000001
just by observing things for distance

543.3 --> 550.5
pictures but so yeah to measure it out

546.959 --> 552.3889999999999
is more concrete proof if you also do it

550.5 --> 553.399
from the opposite axis then you're gonna

552.389 --> 555.569
get that

553.399 --> 557.069
observation that we're talking about

555.569 --> 558.68
that you're gonna have curvature on both

557.069 --> 561.149
axes

558.68 --> 563.67
so that you would actually see the third

561.149 --> 566.189
person the orthographic view so to speak

563.67 --> 569.43
and you would actually have to see these

566.189 --> 570.54
two points if I suppose to a certain

569.43 --> 573.2399999999999
extent if you were gonna use two

570.54 --> 576.48
different hot-air balloons and you can

573.24 --> 578.339
visualize it so that they would be at a

576.48 --> 580.1700000000001
hundred and seventy degrees from each

578.339 --> 583.1500000000001
other you know or a hundred

580.17 --> 585.88
130 degrees if you're on the opposite

583.15 --> 589.1999999999999
axis dad that's only if you assume are

585.88 --> 589.2
those oh right yeah

594.12 --> 600.73
yeah but it's safe to say that's never

597.58 --> 602.98
gonna work out but what we can

600.73 --> 606.97
definitely do that is directly useful

602.98 --> 610.75
for us is prove the obstruction rate how

606.97 --> 613.84
much obstruct how what height exactly

610.75 --> 617.22
will be obstructed over what distance in

613.84 --> 620.26
relation to the observer Heights and

617.22 --> 623.4100000000001
we could measure this out so carefully

620.26 --> 626.74
that we could even graph the relation

623.41 --> 630.49
perfectly and just say okay it's just a

626.74 --> 633.4300000000001
corner up to this distance of this much

630.49 --> 636.4300000000001
degree that's how much it's climbed in a

633.43 --> 638.6999999999999
linear rate for example and once we have

636.43 --> 642.81
this formula pretty much much concrete

638.7 --> 646.8100000000001
with other influences like heat and cold

642.81 --> 649.93
maybe bringing the optical slant effect

646.81 --> 653.02
closer despite not changing the observer

649.93 --> 655.3299999999999
height or further away then we can just

653.02 --> 658.84
we could even model it we can model it

655.33 --> 661.21
perfectly and perhaps other people in

658.84 --> 665.26
science if you dig further have actually

661.21 --> 667.8000000000001
done this we just don't know how to

665.26 --> 672.16
recognize it yet

667.8 --> 674.56
because it's so specialized but and they

672.16 --> 675.78
they we are also kind of developing our

674.56 --> 679.03
own

675.78 --> 682.51
language in the approach of this new

679.03 --> 683.4399999999999
field so we're kind of building with our

682.51 --> 686.58
own knowledge with their own

683.44 --> 689.86
interpretation and a lot of these

686.58 --> 692.8000000000001
yeah optics researchers they really have

689.86 --> 695.29
their own language that they used in

692.8 --> 698.9699999999999
that time to work on it and it differs a

695.29 --> 701.86
lot it's like a cultural difference

698.97 --> 704.44
but they are technically pretty much

701.86 --> 707.47
doing the same thing so yeah that's a

704.44 --> 710.7900000000001
bit of an obstacle but not one we can't

707.47 --> 710.7900000000001
overcome and

710.899 --> 716.449
I think it yeah

713.589 --> 718.9390000000001
we're gonna progress a lot in our

716.449 --> 721.99
knowledge of optics and actually proving

718.939 --> 721.99
that there's no curvature

723.55 --> 728.899
any Glover's are never going to be able

726.41 --> 733.179
to counter it because they are still

728.899 --> 735.98
suck with the basic old

733.179 --> 738.379
model concepts that the old fairy tales

735.98 --> 740.529
they have to stick to it and sometimes

738.379 --> 744.98
they even allow themselves to regress

740.529 --> 747.949
some people we will still will still

744.98 --> 752.48
hear people bring up boats over the

747.949 --> 756.6099999999999
horizon basically yes even Tim still

752.48 --> 760.279
does that tim

756.61 --> 762.879
dismisses obstruction because of that

760.279 --> 765.369
fraction completely he just 100%

762.879 --> 769.0690000000001
disregards it every single time

765.369 --> 771.8290000000001
yeah so the one thing that I've noticed

769.069 --> 773.509
in my observations that I've done and

771.829 --> 775.399
they haven't been extensive but I think

773.509 --> 779.089
it's it's significant enough to say

775.399 --> 782.959
something and that is I'm gonna say that

779.089 --> 785.269
no one with their naked eye has ever

782.959 --> 788.179
seen a Boko over the curve it's

785.269 --> 791.569
impossible you know you cannot get that

788.179 --> 794.809
much detail in your own eye to resolve

791.569 --> 797.449
what you're seeing so if you simply see

794.809 --> 802.759
a boat going into the distance you

797.449 --> 807.199
cannot have the acuity in your vision to

802.759 --> 809.499
resolve and and and see that the boat is

807.199 --> 813.139
going over a curve

809.499 --> 816.639
so I mean I call [ __ ] on that right

813.139 --> 820.759
now because even as I've used the p900

816.639 --> 823.61
my observation you know of course I'm

820.759 --> 825.769
biased okay I am biased but I'm trying

823.61 --> 828.649
to be as honest as I can even in my

825.769 --> 830.17
observation with the p900 all I'm seeing

828.649 --> 834.079
is

830.17 --> 835.99
perspective the object is simply getting

834.079 --> 838.6389999999999
smaller it's not

835.99 --> 841.67
you know you understand what I'm saying

838.639 --> 843.41
yeah yeah but I mean so when somebody

841.67 --> 846.11
says I saw Boco over the curve I would

843.41 --> 848.9
say no you didn't not because there's

846.11 --> 853.3000000000001
not a curve first of all but second of

848.9 --> 853.3
all your eye isn't that acute

853.45 --> 860.48
that's right our diffraction limit is

857.47 --> 863.39
makes it so looser makes the optical

860.48 --> 864.44
slam effect closer yeah but see you even

863.39 --> 866.51
think about this going back to socrates

864.44 --> 869.0300000000001
or whatever the myth is who had

866.51 --> 871.64
aristotle who is one of the Greek

869.03 --> 874.97
philosophers who saw a boat go over a

871.64 --> 876.83
curve no he didn't

874.97 --> 879.76
all he did was see a boat go away from

876.83 --> 883.49
him indeed and

879.76 --> 885.74
disappear in the diffracted or in the in

883.49 --> 887.99
the diffraction induced of yeah of the

885.74 --> 889.72
coastal area in the obstruction zone

887.99 --> 894.04
basically

889.72 --> 897.58
as it's like a cut I

894.04 --> 900.04
really see the obstruction zone

897.58 --> 904.1
starting with the optical slant point

900.04 --> 906.62
almost like it's a slice of your vision

904.1 --> 908.5400000000001
like a piece of the angle a piece of the

906.62 --> 910.6
pie of what you're seeing is just cut

908.54 --> 913.73
out

910.6 --> 914.77
at the horizon would you agree to that

913.73 --> 917.0600000000001
description

914.77 --> 919.1899999999999
say that again I was paying attention to

917.06 --> 921.31
traffic say it again there's just a

919.19 --> 924.32
piece

921.31 --> 927.14
being cut out of your vision like

924.32 --> 930.1700000000001
there's a piece of the pie of the entire

927.14 --> 932.48
angle of what you're seeing is just cut

930.17 --> 933.76
out and it's kind of stitched together

932.48 --> 936.38
it's

933.76 --> 938.98
that's how you see things in the super

936.38 --> 938.98
far distance

940.24 --> 946.019
but you get that

943.889 --> 949.309
yeah yeah it's just an interesting

946.019 --> 949.309
abstraction to think through

949.369 --> 954.089
but it's funny because that's pretty

952.199 --> 957.149
much exactly what my earlier

954.089 --> 959.089
descriptions my earlier drawings were

957.149 --> 961.939
like

959.089 --> 965.899
describe that effect exactly

961.939 --> 970.3689999999999
see if I can still have it somewhere

965.899 --> 970.369
earlier optical slant picture

979.339 --> 982.339
sorry

983.089 --> 986.989
you're breaking up there from

990.17 --> 996.4699999999999
what am I not come a minute you were

993.899 --> 996.47
breaking up

997.25 --> 1004.6
it's not right

999.69 --> 1004.6
ah my crappy drawing picture

1014.929 --> 1021.139
I'm gonna find it on my desktop should

1018.6 --> 1021.139
be here

1027.41 --> 1030.97
all right there is

1034.51 --> 1037.89
the enhanced version

1038.79 --> 1041.79
right

1044.13 --> 1050.909
right so typical effects I

1048.39 --> 1053.3700000000001
I pretty much

1050.909 --> 1055.8990000000001
I'm starting to

1053.37 --> 1057.9289999999999
experience or how do you say figure out

1055.899 --> 1060.4499999999998
or

1057.929 --> 1063.429
draw a conclusion

1060.45 --> 1065.559
concerning the obstruction due to lack

1063.429 --> 1067.38
from air clarity because I think that is

1065.559 --> 1072.37
actually refraction

1067.38 --> 1076.919
it's the dispersing of lights due to all

1072.37 --> 1080.4399999999998
the material the water vapor the

1076.919 --> 1082.5700000000002
of the same medium basically you're

1080.44 --> 1084.63
looking through and that over a distance

1082.57 --> 1087.24
eventually will cause

1084.63 --> 1090.3700000000001
refraction none

1087.24 --> 1092.669
medium radical changes refraction which

1090.37 --> 1096.07
causes blurring

1092.669 --> 1098.8890000000001
it just fusses everything out and I

1096.07 --> 1101.1589999999999
think that's what obstructs are a few on

1098.889 --> 1103.9599999999998
this super long distance basically

1101.159 --> 1106.6200000000001
because if that didn't happen then we

1103.96 --> 1109.1200000000001
could potentially see infinitely

1106.62 --> 1111.0
beyond the slant as long as things were

1109.12 --> 1113.5
high enough density

1111.0 --> 1117.36
but we can't because that will even

1113.5 --> 1119.19
become mist it out because of refraction

1117.36 --> 1122.039
and

1119.19 --> 1124.99
yeah then there of course is the the

1122.039 --> 1127.809
diffraction which happens when you look

1124.99 --> 1132.1490000000001
past a flat surface and that's just an

1127.809 --> 1134.25
optical phenomena it's very hard to

1132.149 --> 1137.139
explain it

1134.25 --> 1139.75
although it can be explained to do the

1137.139 --> 1143.049
physical effects of it but it is very

1139.75 --> 1146.44
much demonstrable you can demonstrate it

1143.049 --> 1149.32
to yourself very very easily if you're

1146.44 --> 1151.169
honest with yourself really study what

1149.32 --> 1153.76
you're observing

1151.169 --> 1157.269
demonstrated so it's just it is there

1153.76 --> 1161.049
why it's there another mystery of nature

1157.269 --> 1163.139
but it is and so we should account for

1161.049 --> 1163.139
it

1164.32 --> 1168.37
and if you're going to ignore it

1166.1 --> 1171.1699999999998
completely yeah then you can imagine oh

1168.37 --> 1174.5
the diffraction effectively curvature

1171.17 --> 1177.76
but it's not curvature because it's the

1174.5 --> 1181.07
linear obstruction rate and

1177.76 --> 1184.34
this land effect or the apparent curve

1181.07 --> 1186.62
where the curve starts migrates when

1184.34 --> 1189.3799999999999
your observer Heights migrates in a

1186.62 --> 1193.25
linear fashion and you can observe this

1189.38 --> 1195.1100000000001
in live footage tim has made a lot of

1193.25 --> 1198.49
footage with his drone where he did this

1195.11 --> 1200.99
and I just pointed look there that

1198.49 --> 1204.38
position there is where the slant is and

1200.99 --> 1207.73
see as you move up it literally almost

1204.38 --> 1211.91
like a wave just migrates inside

1207.73 --> 1213.59
it's it's fascinating to behold but it

1211.91 --> 1217.45
really is there and it is an optical

1213.59 --> 1217.4499999999998
effect just it

1217.87 --> 1225.9089999999999
so yes so go back to the discussion Tim

1223.47 --> 1230.1100000000001
had the other day that you you went on

1225.909 --> 1234.25
his hangout I only caught some of it so

1230.11 --> 1237.6689999999999
did he ever show his footage from his

1234.25 --> 1241.659
vantage point zooming into or did he

1237.669 --> 1244.5590000000002
only show the still of the buildings and

1241.659 --> 1248.529
the water

1244.559 --> 1250.9289999999999
because it seemed to be he seemed to be

1248.529 --> 1254.86
making a point that there was land

1250.929 --> 1258.3990000000001
between him and the building that was

1254.86 --> 1262.029
supposedly behind the water as well and

1258.399 --> 1264.309
I only ever saw one image so now he

1262.029 --> 1268.559
showed multiple things he didn't always

1264.309 --> 1272.1689999999999
present it yeah also had footage

1268.559 --> 1275.47
one guy had like a loop an image of a

1272.169 --> 1277.69
camera rising in the air beholding a

1275.47 --> 1280.33
bridge going into the distance and land

1277.69 --> 1281.97
there and you could see the slant effect

1280.33 --> 1285.58
just appear it's

1281.97 --> 1289.24
optically it is very much as you observe

1285.58 --> 1290.98
it like things if you go down just fold

1289.24 --> 1295.679
into the horizon

1290.98 --> 1295.679
it's literally like they fold

1300.51 --> 1307.21
and they just disappeared just the side

1304.299 --> 1309.149
of it gets erased it just disappears in

1307.21 --> 1311.679
the obstruction in the

1309.149 --> 1313.51
direction cause obstruction it's I

1311.679 --> 1315.039
wonder how much I wonder how much of a

1313.51 --> 1318.549
discussion we would be having on this

1315.039 --> 1321.669
you know if the if the consensus was

1318.549 --> 1323.649
flattering you know I mean we wouldn't

1321.669 --> 1325.0200000000002
be arguing about optics as much I don't

1323.649 --> 1327.1899999999998
think I

1325.02 --> 1330.039
think it would be simple it would be a

1327.19 --> 1331.419
much simpler discussion if the consensus

1330.039 --> 1333.61
was you know I mean the only thing

1331.419 --> 1335.0200000000002
that's making this a difficult

1333.61 --> 1338.1689999999999
conversation is you've got two different

1335.02 --> 1340.48
paradigms well it is basically because

1338.169 --> 1342.88
we are dispelling the curvature myth

1340.48 --> 1345.76
that keeps them propelling to and

1342.88 --> 1349.63
reinforce their religious beliefs but

1345.76 --> 1352.34
actual scientists as long as you don't

1349.63 --> 1354.2600000000002
trigger word them with flattered or

1352.34 --> 1357.47
something or maybe they just don't care

1354.26 --> 1360.23
they will be very climbed to agree with

1357.47 --> 1361.33
us because they're not idiots and you're

1360.23 --> 1364.33
not bias

1361.33 --> 1364.33
yeah

1366.98 --> 1376.18
so that just optics alone is a worthy

1371.45 --> 1376.18
discussion maybe as a group to approach

1376.99 --> 1382.27
yeah University students that are like

1379.91 --> 1383.92
in their last year maybe you're halfway

1382.27 --> 1386.6299999999999
to

1383.92 --> 1387.89
actually just say like yeah how are you

1386.63 --> 1389.42
learning have you heard about this

1387.89 --> 1391.01
effect have you heard about that so that

1389.42 --> 1394.8200000000002
effect what do you think about it just

1391.01 --> 1396.1299999999999
get some real heavy eye and discussions

1394.82 --> 1398.6899999999998
going

1396.13 --> 1401.5100000000002
preferably without using the word Flat

1398.69 --> 1404.68
Earth maybe afterward once most

1401.51 --> 1406.94
information has been laid out

1404.68 --> 1409.24
but I think that would be a worthy

1406.94 --> 1409.24
endeavor

1409.57 --> 1415.9399999999998
maybe so yeah it's typically something

1411.77 --> 1418.57
Riley could do we already has now that's

1415.94 --> 1422.26
different type of University

1418.57 --> 1425.0
yeah it would be more physics

1422.26 --> 1427.72
university I guess that we would have to

1425.0 --> 1430.49
approach who knows I

1427.72 --> 1432.13
think it would be interesting to do to

1430.49 --> 1435.56
try it out

1432.13 --> 1438.23
maybe to get a grasp of the just the

1435.56 --> 1440.32
general culture of these places you know

1438.23 --> 1443.26
how they are they all like the ballers

1440.32 --> 1445.72
probably not

1443.26 --> 1448.09
some may be

1445.72 --> 1451.09
interesting to find out

1448.09 --> 1451.09
anyway

1452.65 --> 1458.14
yep there's lots of places to go

1459.09 --> 1461.72
yep

1461.94 --> 1469.019
lots to do for the Flat Earth community

1464.85 --> 1471.289
or each individual if you want to if you

1469.019 --> 1471.289
dare

1475.23 --> 1478.07
well God

1478.34 --> 1483.09
should know better but I'm gonna address

1480.84 --> 1486.86
Rasta for a moment he's constantly

1483.09 --> 1488.75
harping about conferencing about

1486.86 --> 1494.539
Ravi and

1488.75 --> 1497.12
the VIP guests yeah you know what I

1494.539 --> 1500.429
talked to

1497.12 --> 1503.4599999999998
Patricia yesterday or like in the chat

1500.429 --> 1506.46
Qi I asked her a few questions and she

1503.46 --> 1508.19
answered it and it's really all not all

1506.46 --> 1512.059
that dramatic

1508.19 --> 1514.74
they were very polite very nice

1512.059 --> 1517.49
nobody was really embarrassed it was

1514.74 --> 1520.769
just awkward basically that is all and

1517.49 --> 1523.309
there were no fights or anything and was

1520.769 --> 1526.74
just fine everybody was nice so

1523.309 --> 1530.01
yeah it was kind of silly but it didn't

1526.74 --> 1531.529
explode or anything so that's what she

1530.01 --> 1534.51
said

1531.529 --> 1535.58
yeah it was very low-key I mean he came

1534.51 --> 1538.47
up on stage

1535.58 --> 1541.9089999999999
said hello said what he was there for

1538.47 --> 1541.909
and then I never saw him again

1545.63 --> 1551.8200000000002
daddy for me it felt just like there

1549.539 --> 1554.46
were there was a flat earth conference

1551.82 --> 1558.4189999999999
and there was just this guy and his

1554.46 --> 1560.039
group fans that really didn't Mack mix

1558.419 --> 1561.8090000000002
together but they didn't really bother

1560.039 --> 1565.01
each other so they were just like two

1561.809 --> 1568.549
groups being together it's like I

1565.01 --> 1571.6
kind of weird like that

1568.549 --> 1573.91
that's it

1571.6 --> 1575.8799999999999
yeah well like I said I never saw him

1573.91 --> 1578.19
after he first came up and said alone

1575.88 --> 1581.0700000000002
right

1578.19 --> 1584.77
maybe he didn't hang around for long

1581.07 --> 1587.4399999999998
well I know that Nathan Thompson got him

1584.77 --> 1590.8
in an interview and posted on his

1587.44 --> 1592.42
channel so you can see that I don't know

1590.8 --> 1594.81
if anybody else that everyone [ __ ] got

1592.42 --> 1594.8100000000002
him or not

1600.95 --> 1605.179
but I'll tell you what it was a it was a

1603.38 --> 1607.3990000000001
huge letdown in terms of calling him a

1605.179 --> 1608.5590000000002
celebrity everybody else had in their

1607.399 --> 1610.6299999999999
mind somebody

1608.559 --> 1614.2
really

1610.63 --> 1618.019
the caliber of a celebrity

1614.2 --> 1620.8600000000001
by societal standards modern standards

1618.019 --> 1620.86
he kind of is

1621.159 --> 1626.5390000000002
the name came out we all looked at each

1623.33 --> 1628.4499999999998
other we were saying who right who is

1626.539 --> 1631.45
this

1628.45 --> 1631.45
yeah

1631.96 --> 1638.69
yeah it's silly

1634.51 --> 1641.6299999999999
it you know I wouldn't have kept it a

1638.69 --> 1644.96
secret I would talk but on the other

1641.63 --> 1647.63
hand maybe he just really wanted the the

1644.96 --> 1652.01
attention or whatever he just saw it as

1647.63 --> 1654.0800000000002
an attention stunt and he knew like

1652.01 --> 1655.76
people were gonna be squabbling about it

1654.08 --> 1659.83
if he brought it up earlier so he just

1655.76 --> 1659.83
did it maybe that was the reason

1767.669 --> 1773.45
and

1769.07 --> 1773.45
of course the Flat Earth

1773.929 --> 1778.22
updates what's going on roughly

1776.46 --> 1780.72
especially in the

1778.22 --> 1782.549
intellectual field in the scientific

1780.72 --> 1784.909
field I'm very interested mostly that

1782.549 --> 1787.83
not not so much about

1784.909 --> 1790.1000000000001
yeah how many subscribers a person's God

1790.28 --> 1796.8899999999999
look another flat earther Hey yeah and

1793.789 --> 1799.59
there are so many other of them out

1796.89 --> 1800.8400000000001
there it's just you can't keep track of

1799.59 --> 1804.6789999999999
it I

1800.84 --> 1804.6789999999999
can't some people

1807.09 --> 1809.72
yep

1816.44 --> 1822.19
so glad I have to teacher like normally

1819.65 --> 1824.5400000000002
I wouldn't bother people with the heater

1822.19 --> 1826.72
in your face I know it's kind of

1824.54 --> 1830.0
annoying to some people

1826.72 --> 1833.18
is that what's behind you yeah but I

1830.0 --> 1834.95
really need that because otherwise you

1833.18 --> 1839.3600000000001
just forget increase the death in this

1834.95 --> 1841.91
hour it's that cold and yeah I could

1839.36 --> 1843.61
just put on my jacket and do my hangout

1841.91 --> 1845.9
like that

1843.61 --> 1848.4499999999998
if you scoot over a little bit to your

1845.9 --> 1851.6200000000001
left you'll have an Khorana around your

1848.45 --> 1851.6200000000001
head I know

1862.72 --> 1867.54
[Music]

1864.49 --> 1870.52
so what do we you're on

1867.54 --> 1873.27
early-bird 12 is that what it is no 13

1870.52 --> 1873.27
13

1873.93 --> 1881.2
you know the history of number 13

1877.65 --> 1883.66
I'm sure I've heard bits and pieces why

1881.2 --> 1885.22
it's considered unlucky yeah I remember

1883.66 --> 1887.3500000000001
hearing it but I can't recall it off the

1885.22 --> 1889.84
top of my head so feel free to it's kind

1887.35 --> 1892.33
of funny it should be noteworthy to

1889.84 --> 1896.29
flat-earthers at least some of them

1892.33 --> 1897.84
because it is it comes from the

1896.29 --> 1902.07
Freemasonry

1897.84 --> 1902.07
it was a day when

1907.35 --> 1913.7199999999998
but number the the 13th that that was a

1910.72 --> 1915.58
day when like there was like a

1913.72 --> 1919.51
revolution I think or a mass

1915.58 --> 1921.58
assassination of renascence because they

1919.51 --> 1923.41
were figured out and people didn't buy

1921.58 --> 1927.33
it I think it has to do with like

1923.41 --> 1929.47
earlier banking scams with gold scams

1927.33 --> 1932.8899999999999
something like that I don't know exactly

1929.47 --> 1934.95
the D but this is official historical so

1932.89 --> 1934.95
you

1935.01 --> 1940.02
didn't talk about it but yeah 13 is my

1938.02 --> 1943.62
lucky you know it's always has been

1940.02 --> 1946.21
especially Friday the 13

1943.62 --> 1950.01
the funny thing is I tend to find money

1946.21 --> 1950.01
in these days so weird I

1950.13 --> 1954.99
guess other people get unlucky and I get

1952.75 --> 1954.99
lucky

1955.68 --> 1962.8300000000002
you don't label a

1958.53 --> 1965.43
building floor 13 it's still the 13th

1962.83 --> 1967.96
floor it's not like you can see

1965.43 --> 1970.27
just because you don't call it the 13th

1967.96 --> 1972.13
floor doesn't mean it's not the floor I

1970.27 --> 1975.31
always thought I always thought that was

1972.13 --> 1979.47
[ __ ] - yeah if you don't want a 13th

1975.31 --> 1979.47
floor then make 12 storey buildings

1979.92 --> 1985.53
is the 13th floor wait why yeah but

1983.92 --> 1987.3400000000001
you're not gonna live on the roof right

1985.53 --> 1989.1
what's that got to do with anything

1987.34 --> 1991.3799999999999
there's still 13

1989.1 --> 1995.779
no no

1991.38 --> 1997.1290000000001
make an 11-story high building in see

1995.779 --> 1999.46
that's where you get into the craziness

1997.129 --> 2004.83
of the metaphysical

1999.46 --> 2008.259
gymnastics there is no 13th floor

2004.83 --> 2010.72
or you could do it like being John

2008.259 --> 2014.789
Malkovich like in that movie if you seen

2010.72 --> 2018.1000000000001
that I have like a half floor

2014.789 --> 2020.549
I crouch down because it's only a meter

2018.1 --> 2023.4089999999999
high that was so weird

2020.549 --> 2026.83
that was the so-called missing 13th

2023.409 --> 2030.5700000000002
floor I think was it's like one of these

2026.83 --> 2035.1689999999999
floors anyway that was weird but yeah

2030.57 --> 2036.809
now 13 I would take 13 anytime 13 is a

2035.169 --> 2038.7
lucky number to me

2036.809 --> 2042.239
and

2038.7 --> 2044.559
hey everybody that considers it unlucky

2042.239 --> 2047.3690000000001
consider that that is mostly just

2044.559 --> 2047.369
psychosomatic

2048.51 --> 2053.2200000000003
a lot about superstitious lock and

2052.419 --> 2057.52
unlock

2053.22 --> 2060.149
has to do with psychosomatic almost a

2057.52 --> 2060.149
hundred percent

2060.179 --> 2064.78
so I

2062.129 --> 2066.399
don't buy into what I mean what do you

2064.78 --> 2067.5400000000004
mean by psychosomatic I always thought

2066.399 --> 2070.649
that that was something to deal with

2067.54 --> 2073.0
your mental image your physical body

2070.649 --> 2074.919
Franco you say psychosomatic I'm

2073.0 --> 2078.869
thinking it is something different well

2074.919 --> 2082.319
that your mind will create the effect

2078.869 --> 2085.869
because you believe it

2082.319 --> 2088.45
if you're afraid to be unlucky there's a

2085.869 --> 2090.04
big chance if you stick to that in your

2088.45 --> 2094.379
mind if you don't step out if you don't

2090.04 --> 2094.379
let go that you will become unlucky

2095.04 --> 2100.72
it's it's normal Mexica logical

2098.89 --> 2104.8799999999997
mechanism and the same by the way close

2100.72 --> 2107.95
goes for the common cold

2104.88 --> 2109.96
if you believe it is infectious if you

2107.95 --> 2114.299
believe that you could be infected from

2109.96 --> 2115.839
people that are sneezing around you like

2114.299 --> 2118.27
angry

2115.839 --> 2120.069
yeah then you're gonna get a cold I am

2118.27 --> 2121.63
around these people all the freaking

2120.069 --> 2123.94
time now they're like blubbering all

2121.63 --> 2127.81
over the place look like [ __ ] I don't

2123.94 --> 2130.0
give a crap I really don't I

2127.81 --> 2132.37
I could technically kiss them on the

2130.0 --> 2136.08
mouth it wouldn't matter I would not get

2132.37 --> 2139.21
it because I am mentally protected I

2136.08 --> 2141.75
haven't had a real cold in such an

2139.21 --> 2146.4700000000003
incredible long I know

2141.75 --> 2148.27
although when I the thing is if you hang

2146.47 --> 2149.37
around a lot of people sneezing and

2148.27 --> 2153.54
coughing

2149.37 --> 2156.04
just long enough hearing that

2153.54 --> 2158.59
even if you try to like put it out of

2156.04 --> 2161.14
your mind and just disbelieve it then

2158.59 --> 2163.6600000000003
you might still contract it just because

2161.14 --> 2166.95
of the subconscious psychosomatic

2163.66 --> 2169.41
elements because of the Association

2166.95 --> 2172.75
so I

2169.41 --> 2174.22
don't hang around these people like if

2172.75 --> 2176.74
somebody has a call I'm not gonna like

2174.22 --> 2181.0299999999997
stand around them on purpose just to

2176.74 --> 2183.1299999999997
prove that I can but I deal with people

2181.03 --> 2186.03
that have common colds all the time and

2183.13 --> 2189.07
I don't get infected I

2186.03 --> 2191.02
don't get the same thing hey what hey

2189.07 --> 2193.59
we're just saying when you say it's the

2191.02 --> 2195.6
mental state to

2193.59 --> 2198.15
speak

2195.6 --> 2200.71
all these must

2198.15 --> 2203.31
that's all you're doing is running

2200.71 --> 2205.77
around saying I'm sick all the time

2203.31 --> 2209.62
that's what's gonna happen in real life

2205.77 --> 2212.32
well it's a little it's a one step more

2209.62 --> 2215.41
than that because the common cold those

2212.32 --> 2218.8900000000003
symptoms are actually a physical

2215.41 --> 2223.2999999999997
cleaning process it cleans you up it

2218.89 --> 2225.8799999999997
it's like an overhaul to fix things up

2223.3 --> 2228.7200000000003
in your body and that does have benefits

2225.88 --> 2233.65
to undergo that process

2228.72 --> 2236.74
so if you yeah it's not bad to sometimes

2233.65 --> 2240.34
get a cold and just sit through it don't

2236.74 --> 2243.1299999999997
poison yourself with with chemicals to

2240.34 --> 2245.7400000000002
stave the symptoms or anything and you

2243.13 --> 2248.9500000000003
will be cleaned up afterwards inside

2245.74 --> 2250.8399999999997
it's actually good for you but that's a

2248.95 --> 2252.6699999999996
mechanism that your body can do and it

2250.84 --> 2254.13
will be psychosomatically triggered

2252.67 --> 2257.62
there's other ways to do the same

2254.13 --> 2261.75
without having all the symptoms but yeah

2257.62 --> 2261.75
it's it's an natural mechanism

2261.78 --> 2268.5600000000004
that's how I see it very I don't see it

2265.45 --> 2273.0299999999997
as an infection whatever

2268.56 --> 2273.0299999999997
it's a mental infection

2276.369 --> 2279.3900000000003
don't take the flu shot people don't

2278.59 --> 2283.4500000000003
ever

2279.39 --> 2286.48
from the angle even if you believe there

2283.45 --> 2288.7
it's real even you believe that if you

2286.48 --> 2292.51
believe vaccines work these things are

2288.7 --> 2295.6899999999996
not designed to function as they are

2292.51 --> 2299.2000000000003
portrayed they are designed to actually

2295.69 --> 2300.849
spread disease to attack you don't know

2299.2 --> 2305.47
how you could tell it too bad it's bad

2300.849 --> 2308.23
for you because it's free you can go

2305.47 --> 2310.359
into any pharmacy and I will go I walked

2308.23 --> 2313.359
into a pharmacy one time and the lady

2310.359 --> 2315.16
asked me about six times do you want to

2313.359 --> 2319.06
do you want your free flu shot and I

2315.16 --> 2321.609
said no no thank you can I get you again

2319.06 --> 2323.83
and then she ain't gonna give it to you

2321.609 --> 2326.38
you don't want the flu shot and I'm like

2323.83 --> 2328.9
if I am some type of movie aside what

2326.38 --> 2331.15
the [ __ ] are you kidding me like no I

2328.9 --> 2334.27
don't want the flu shot please leave me

2331.15 --> 2336.119
alone I finished my purchase and before

2334.27 --> 2338.71
I walk away she's like

2336.119 --> 2340.4500000000003
you sure are you sure you don't want the

2338.71 --> 2342.07
flu shot because it's flu season and I

2340.45 --> 2344.29
just walked away from her because I was

2342.07 --> 2346.51
like I don't believe this lady right now

2344.29 --> 2349.74
just asked me six times if I want this

2346.51 --> 2349.7400000000002
flu shot get out of here

2350.22 --> 2357.16
well I pick it up her ass I haven't

2355.45 --> 2361.27
gotten I don't think I've ever gotten a

2357.16 --> 2364.5099999999998
flu I don't remember the last time I

2361.27 --> 2366.339
took the flu shot and no I won't be

2364.51 --> 2370.69
doing any of that nobody's sticking

2366.339 --> 2374.07
anything in me sorry indeed I've never

2370.69 --> 2377.73
had one I'm very glad I haven't

2374.07 --> 2377.73
yeah I'm listening to

2378.3 --> 2381.3790000000004
[Music]

2382.77 --> 2388.06
and as I was listening to it yesterday I

2385.99 --> 2391.7999999999997
had a thought in my mind so I put a poll

2388.06 --> 2394.85
up on my Facebook page and said you know

2391.8 --> 2398.61
if the CDC had an adult

2394.85 --> 2403.37
vaccination that they wanted to test how

2398.61 --> 2403.3700000000003
many of you would sign up as testers I

2403.67 --> 2410.63
mean nobody would be insane good well

2410.66 --> 2416.94
there's yeah yes corporations actually

2413.73 --> 2418.37
that pay people to do that to be

2416.94 --> 2421.44
experimented on

2418.37 --> 2423.3599999999997
no I get it I get it I'm just throwing

2421.44 --> 2426.48
it out there to see what kind of kind of

2423.36 --> 2428.04
responses I would I would get but yeah

2426.48 --> 2430.5
because one of the things that the

2428.04 --> 2435.11
author goes through is that he he goes

2430.5 --> 2435.11
through this one case where one of the

2435.38 --> 2443.4300000000003
one of the croc court trials they had an

2439.62 --> 2445.35
expert from the CDC come on and the

2443.43 --> 2446.8399999999997
cross examiner was asking him have you

2445.35 --> 2450.39
ever

2446.84 --> 2451.83
had test subjects that were mentally

2450.39 --> 2453.69
handicapped have you ever tested these

2451.83 --> 2457.92
vaccinations on the mentally handicapped

2453.69 --> 2460.08
and he was like yes and have you ever

2457.92 --> 2462.48
tested have you ever had test subjects

2460.08 --> 2464.1
that were homeless and it was just

2462.48 --> 2466.65
really interesting and the way that the

2464.1 --> 2469.3199999999997
author put it isn't his interpretation

2466.65 --> 2472.35
was that you've got test subjects who

2469.32 --> 2475.6200000000003
who can't necessarily complain or make a

2472.35 --> 2478.3199999999997
big stink if something goes wrong you

2475.62 --> 2482.3599999999997
know with the test on the vaccinations

2478.32 --> 2482.36
but that's so efficient

2482.66 --> 2486.81
not only that but if you already have

2484.89 --> 2488.8799999999997
mental disabilities and you get

2486.81 --> 2491.07
vaccinated how are you able to determine

2488.88 --> 2493.2200000000003
the the effect on your mental stability

2491.07 --> 2496.29
if there was a side effect in that area

2493.22 --> 2498.5699999999997
exactly the point you're gonna you're

2496.29 --> 2500.94
gonna make experiments on that on you're

2498.57 --> 2503.06
gonna use people and then you're gonna

2500.94 --> 2506.87
use people that are mentally handicapped

2503.06 --> 2511.68
take that badge is a suspect right there

2506.87 --> 2515.8199999999997
sorry all about it is suspect the I know

2511.68 --> 2519.7799999999997
the entire industry is polluted and evil

2515.82 --> 2522.4
and in my humble opinion they should the

2519.78 --> 2523.96
entire industry worldwide should be

2522.4 --> 2526.17
taken carefully on the middle OOP and

2523.96 --> 2529.45
then

2526.17 --> 2531.73
refined and prosecuted the people that

2529.45 --> 2536.22
are actually responsible for it being

2531.73 --> 2536.22
the way it is should be prosecuted

2536.52 --> 2544.319
yeah I've got to go back I remember

2540.369 --> 2548.609
watching probably a year ago a

2544.319 --> 2550.72
YouTube expose and

2548.609 --> 2552.569
one of the things that they were talking

2550.72 --> 2556.1499999999996
about in the polio

2552.569 --> 2558.52
epidemic in the 50s or the 40s was that

2556.15 --> 2561.19
there was this one young 19 year old

2558.52 --> 2563.38
girl who is just really smart and she

2561.19 --> 2565.15
was she was analyzing what they were

2563.38 --> 2567.75
doing and she said you know if you guys

2565.15 --> 2569.6800000000003
keep messing with these mice brain

2567.75 --> 2571.42
vaccination stuff she said we're gonna

2569.68 --> 2574.109
see an outbreak of cancer in 50 years

2571.42 --> 2577.2400000000002
like we've never imagined

2574.109 --> 2579.13
and it was just really interesting to

2577.24 --> 2581.9399999999996
look at what they understood and knew

2579.13 --> 2584.46
back in the 40s and 50s and yet they're

2581.94 --> 2587.77
pushing ahead with their vaccination

2584.46 --> 2590.26
tests well they made the discoveries

2587.77 --> 2593.349
with good conscience and then evil

2590.26 --> 2597.599
people jumped onto it say all nice more

2593.349 --> 2600.76
things to destroy humanity with hmm

2597.599 --> 2604.349
that's what happened you genesis latched

2600.76 --> 2604.349
on to the vaccine industry

2610.14 --> 2615.5299999999997
yep it's a problem

2613.04 --> 2619.36
that's also a cultural problem because

2615.53 --> 2619.36
it is indoctrination basis

2621.07 --> 2626.9900000000002
it's very it's a silly to say but it's

2624.26 --> 2628.34
like snake oil salesman and the funny

2626.99 --> 2631.1299999999997
thing is everybody knows what that means

2628.34 --> 2633.59
the silly thing about it is that snake

2631.13 --> 2636.7400000000002
oil actually does have metal properties

2633.59 --> 2640.01
yeah that's the crazy thing about it it

2636.74 --> 2642.5299999999997
does actually work but the saying goes

2640.01 --> 2646.0
in that sense for the vaccine industry

2642.53 --> 2651.38
it's super outdated it's been polluted

2646.0 --> 2655.46
with with people that are applying it in

2651.38 --> 2657.1400000000003
a way that doesn't function as it is

2655.46 --> 2659.36
supposed to be it doesn't function

2657.14 --> 2661.8199999999997
according to the original principles and

2659.36 --> 2665.03
they're just using it for destructive

2661.82 --> 2667.06
reasons and applying indoctrination to

2665.03 --> 2670.7900000000004
keep it going and

2667.06 --> 2672.7999999999997
well a cultural awakening which has been

2670.79 --> 2674.05
steadily going on for at least twenty

2672.8 --> 2676.67
years is

2674.05 --> 2679.76
the counterweight is the thing that will

2676.67 --> 2681.91
prevent more and more people from doing

2679.76 --> 2685.07
that and eventually

2681.91 --> 2688.5499999999997
allowing us that pretty much take them

2685.07 --> 2690.46
down through government or suing through

2688.55 --> 2694.13
justice system either way

2690.46 --> 2698.11
so and that should happen because they

2694.13 --> 2698.11
they just need to stop doing that

2703.6 --> 2709.95
right so for everyone out there

2706.47 --> 2714.25
vaccines be very very careful with them

2709.95 --> 2716.16
some of the older vaccines where you

2714.25 --> 2721.18
would get like

2716.16 --> 2725.5
anti child disease Jesus they'd actually

2721.18 --> 2729.3399999999997
do work I had some of those didn't have

2725.5 --> 2731.68
too bad effect it a problem really goes

2729.34 --> 2732.78
and this is proven when you combine too

2731.68 --> 2736.45
many

2732.78 --> 2739.09
vaccines into one the more and the

2736.45 --> 2741.8799999999997
younger you are the more damage it will

2739.09 --> 2744.28
cause that is the model that is really

2741.88 --> 2746.32
the proven model of how it works the

2744.28 --> 2750.13
younger you are the more vulnerable the

2746.32 --> 2751.78
more vaccines the more weight on your

2750.13 --> 2754.69
entire system and if you reach that

2751.78 --> 2756.7900000000004
critical mass typically a baby or

2754.69 --> 2761.7400000000002
whatever will go into convulsion and

2756.79 --> 2763.68
either die ya die or become seriously

2761.74 --> 2765.99
mentally handicapped or

2763.68 --> 2769.75
paralyzed

2765.99 --> 2772.2299999999996
that's why I chose any more often

2769.75 --> 2775.21
because it's the government

2772.23 --> 2777.69
to make so much sense to give infants

2775.21 --> 2780.7
like 40 different shots

2777.69 --> 2785.5
infants shouldn't have shots at all at

2780.7 --> 2788.85
all they just should they need time to

2785.5 --> 2791.59
adapt to the mother milk immune

2788.85 --> 2794.8199999999997
system is that's how they get me and

2791.59 --> 2798.88
then after a certain age then

2794.82 --> 2800.71
yeah then you can basically when they're

2798.88 --> 2802.6600000000003
going to be walking around basically

2800.71 --> 2805.71
interacting with others they okay you

2802.66 --> 2809.5299999999997
could get some basic child effects if

2805.71 --> 2811.66
but you don't necessarily need to get

2809.53 --> 2815.5600000000004
some advice on it would be very careful

2811.66 --> 2818.22
that that I could consider that okay but

2815.56 --> 2822.63
things like flu vaccines

2818.22 --> 2824.759
absolutely ridiculous it's never worked

2822.63 --> 2827.67
can't work it can't even work according

2824.759 --> 2830.46
to their own theory because the germs

2827.67 --> 2833.5190000000002
that they're giving you vaccines for are

2830.46 --> 2835.98
outdated by the thought you basically

2833.519 --> 2839.339
can't make a flu vaccine because before

2835.98 --> 2841.529
you have done mass producing that strain

2839.339 --> 2844.65
the strain in the world will already

2841.529 --> 2847.529
have mutated beyond it to function and

2844.65 --> 2851.339
that's the facts that's a medical fact

2847.529 --> 2855.809
it is so ridiculous or whatever works it

2851.339 --> 2859.019
can't work but basic vaccines for child

2855.809 --> 2861.259
diseases that does have potential

2859.019 --> 2863.3089999999997
benefits if you're careful with

2861.259 --> 2865.67
don't reject them when they're still

2863.309 --> 2867.869
babies

2865.67 --> 2869.16
one of the things that blew my mind I

2867.869 --> 2872.46
was talking with a friend of mine who's

2869.16 --> 2875.97
who's had three children at home and

2872.46 --> 2879.029
all-natural and one of the things that

2875.97 --> 2883.529
he told me was that and I'd love to look

2879.029 --> 2886.319
into this but so when when you cut the

2883.529 --> 2889.67
umbilical cord after birth you know you

2886.319 --> 2893.329
separate from the oh

2889.67 --> 2893.329
now I've lost the

2894.89 --> 2900.95
the term less than to shoot yeah the

2898.43 --> 2902.96
placenta yeah so he wasn't the things

2900.95 --> 2906.2
that he said was you know after his

2902.96 --> 2908.56
children were born for 45 minutes or so

2906.2 --> 2912.23
they left the child

2908.56 --> 2914.95
connected to the placenta because of all

2912.23 --> 2917.75
of the nutrients and

2914.95 --> 2919.16
I don't even know what to say I mean

2917.75 --> 2921.2
just the nutrients that are in the

2919.16 --> 2922.7599999999998
placenta itself and he said the one

2921.2 --> 2924.5
reason why they want you to cut it so

2922.76 --> 2926.48
soon in the hospitals because they take

2924.5 --> 2927.83
the placenta and extract from it

2926.48 --> 2929.45
everything that they can as soon as

2927.83 --> 2932.98
possible because it's got so much power

2929.45 --> 2936.1
to it mm-hmm and I was just blown away

2932.98 --> 2938.9
absolutely yeah placenta is like a

2936.1 --> 2940.79
miracle organ you can do all kinds of

2938.9 --> 2944.4700000000003
things with that so then cutting off

2940.79 --> 2947.84
that's probably the next best step for

2944.47 --> 2949.4599999999996
them like getting it instead of getting

2947.84 --> 2952.9900000000002
an abortion that's like the next best

2949.46 --> 2952.9900000000002
bet for them right

2955.09 --> 2960.9100000000003
incredible I know I've heard about that

2959.12 --> 2964.19
the Santa is

2960.91 --> 2967.48
very viable for our kinds of medical

2964.19 --> 2972.58
resources that are not bad that are not

2967.48 --> 2972.58
evasive toxic toxic so yeah

2975.52 --> 2982.64
the umbilical cord the belly the navel

2979.94 --> 2984.5
the navel closes up and then you and

2982.64 --> 2986.15
then the umbilical cord section drops

2984.5 --> 2987.32
off so my question now that I'm just

2986.15 --> 2990.83
thinking about this with the very first

2987.32 --> 2993.38
time okay pardon me for being naive or

2990.83 --> 2996.2599999999998
whatever but I'm thinking okay so like

2993.38 --> 2998.1800000000003
200-300 years ago did they cut the

2996.26 --> 3002.1400000000003
umbilical cord that soon or did they

2998.18 --> 3004.33
just let it I don't know it depends it

3002.14 --> 3008.08
depends on the circumstances look if

3004.33 --> 3011.77
you're in a very sterile environment

3008.08 --> 3013.87
yeah you could potentially just leave it

3011.77 --> 3015.94
it kind of sounds disgusting but yeah

3013.87 --> 3019.54
you can leave it there for a while some

3015.94 --> 3023.11
people I think even do this but yeah if

3019.54 --> 3024.88
you're in a pretty filthy environment

3023.11 --> 3026.59
you'd want to cut it as quickly as

3024.88 --> 3027.9900000000002
possible because it might also get

3026.59 --> 3032.27
infected

3027.99 --> 3034.7299999999996
they're contaminated as were and yeah so

3032.27 --> 3037.7599999999998
you got to be careful

3034.73 --> 3037.76
considering that

3039.44 --> 3046.13
okay you me

3042.08 --> 3048.729
yeah I just went on you for a second

3046.13 --> 3048.7290000000003
yeah

3048.849 --> 3055.19
but yeah the placenta it is not a

3052.66 --> 3059.049
self-sufficient organ so it will just

3055.19 --> 3059.049
die right

3059.65 --> 3067.7290000000003
and you don't want that yeah when it's

3063.049 --> 3071.41
dead then and wait let's try head not go

3067.729 --> 3075.819
there it's a breakfast [ __ ]

3071.41 --> 3075.819
anyway yeah that stuff

3078.91 --> 3083.569
but

3080.739 --> 3086.41
yeah effect seems to be very very

3083.569 --> 3088.69
careful with that

3086.41 --> 3093.019
don't

3088.69 --> 3095.539
take yeah don't think it's like taking

3093.019 --> 3096.3689999999997
candy or something it's potentially very

3095.539 --> 3099.559
dangerous

3096.369 --> 3101.349
for your immune system especially if

3099.559 --> 3105.079
you're not chemically

3101.349 --> 3108.0190000000002
pure if you're yeah if you eat organic

3105.079 --> 3110.44
and make sure you don't get toxins and

3108.019 --> 3113.7189999999996
everything okay you

3110.44 --> 3115.7290000000003
your body will probably response to any

3113.719 --> 3118.969
vaccine under some circumstances

3115.729 --> 3121.46
reinforce whatever pretty heavily but

3118.969 --> 3123.46
you will also be much more likely to

3121.46 --> 3127.099
recover without any damage

3123.46 --> 3131.69
but if you are like oh you eat Doritos

3127.099 --> 3133.9100000000003
every day in coca-cola zero yeah great

3131.69 --> 3136.869
great like the audit I have a serious

3133.91 --> 3139.67
serious in fact under a new system and

3136.869 --> 3142.339
but potentially even lead to organ

3139.67 --> 3144.41
damage or whatever because it's all in

3142.339 --> 3146.719
all stacks all these toxic elements

3144.41 --> 3150.319
stack and that is really what does the

3146.719 --> 3152.9
damage in the body every toxic thing you

3150.319 --> 3155.269
do you expose yourself that all stacks

3152.9 --> 3157.539
and once it heats hits a certain

3155.269 --> 3161.299
critical mass then

3157.539 --> 3164.21
yeah elements of your being will start

3161.299 --> 3167.18
to falter and fail and breakdown and you

3164.21 --> 3170.119
might get serious psychological symptoms

3167.18 --> 3172.819
changing your entire personality that is

3170.119 --> 3175.4900000000002
what happens when you reach the critical

3172.819 --> 3179.579
mass in toxicity

3175.49 --> 3181.74
so keep it didn't so here's an

3179.579 --> 3183.8590000000004
interesting thought I mean just thinking

3181.74 --> 3183.859
about

3184.279 --> 3192.92
a couple hundred years ago again what

3188.369 --> 3196.8900000000003
were the toxins that people

3192.92 --> 3199.91
experienced a lot all kinds mercury

3196.89 --> 3202.8289999999997
poisoning for example sure

3199.91 --> 3204.569
things are natural oh yeah that time

3202.829 --> 3206.9100000000003
that time period hundred two hundred

3204.569 --> 3209.819
years ago was basically the early and

3206.91 --> 3212.25
late in this realization where

3209.819 --> 3216.42
everything was done up and experimented

3212.25 --> 3219.029
and they have no idea what it did so the

3216.42 --> 3222.69
gold industry for example especially

3219.029 --> 3224.519
when the public one yet very very early

3222.69 --> 3227.609
date was basically done by snake and

3224.519 --> 3230.3999999999996
such say for example the American Gold

3227.609 --> 3234.95
Rush mercury was used because mercury is

3230.4 --> 3239.009
a very easy way to extract gold from

3234.95 --> 3240.6899999999996
or from raw or it's very easy way to do

3239.009 --> 3242.4
it but yeah mercury you're going to

3240.69 --> 3243.66
people that are going to do that then

3242.4 --> 3247.259
they have their hands in it it's going

3243.66 --> 3247.8799999999997
to be a jerk in your skin go insane well

3247.259 --> 3250.7400000000002
I

3247.88 --> 3252.809
mean I heard that's where the term mad

3250.74 --> 3254.569
hatter came from because they yeah make

3252.809 --> 3259.9500000000003
a switch

3254.569 --> 3264.299
yes yeah the mercury helps the hatter to

3259.95 --> 3267.24
shape the hat into a fixed place it's

3264.299 --> 3268.92
really interesting how that works but

3267.24 --> 3270.66
yeah they go insane if they're gonna use

3268.92 --> 3273.38
mercury for that they don't use it

3270.66 --> 3276.1189999999997
nowadays of course

3273.38 --> 3280.319
but there were all kinds of toxins that

3276.119 --> 3282.2400000000002
everyone or certain professions were

3280.319 --> 3285.65
exposed to and there was no regulation

3282.24 --> 3289.14
for this was just okay

3285.65 --> 3290.579
oh right he's that profession okay

3289.14 --> 3293.009
there's a great likelihood he's gonna

3290.579 --> 3297.0190000000002
die of this that's how they see a saw

3293.009 --> 3297.0190000000002
back then no yeah

3297.38 --> 3304.12
I think that's more specialized so that

3301.2 --> 3307.12
if you think about the community that

3304.12 --> 3309.19
necessarily is it not exposed to save

3307.12 --> 3310.48
mercury right or something else along

3309.19 --> 3312.91
those lines I guess that's what I would

3310.48 --> 3316.48
that's my initial question well one of

3312.91 --> 3319.18
the things of course was sugar refined

3316.48 --> 3322.93
sugar a lot of teeth problem when that

3319.18 --> 3324.79
was introduced in the early Renaissance

3322.93 --> 3327.1299999999997
basically with the colonisation and

3324.79 --> 3328.41
everything when the sugar started piling

3327.13 --> 3331.09
in

3328.41 --> 3334.29
that's when a lot of that problem

3331.09 --> 3337.2400000000002
refined food

3334.29 --> 3339.13
that started up even before the

3337.24 --> 3341.4599999999996
industrialization it really reached the

3339.13 --> 3345.46
critical point in the industrialization

3341.46 --> 3348.07
became really toxic but yeah the public

3345.46 --> 3352.62
was exposed to that with all kinds of

3348.07 --> 3352.6200000000003
problems all kinds of problems

3357.45 --> 3361.72
