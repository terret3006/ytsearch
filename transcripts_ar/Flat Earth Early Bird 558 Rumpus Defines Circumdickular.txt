94.4 --> 102.72
um right so

99.04 --> 104.799
weather today is just well

102.72 --> 107.28
i don't know it seems to be a little bit

104.799 --> 112.0
more misty right now but it's just been

107.28 --> 116.88
very hot and

112.0 --> 118.88
with some trails going down up there

116.88 --> 122.32
and kind of see it that's not really

118.88 --> 122.32
regular cloud patterns

122.56 --> 129.92000000000002
so i don't know where it's gonna go

126.0 --> 131.28
but it was very warm today and now it's

129.92 --> 133.35999999999999
getting a bit less so

131.28 --> 135.44
i'm actually gonna find that especially

133.36 --> 137.12
considering tomorrow

135.44 --> 138.959
because unfortunately tomorrow there's

137.12 --> 139.76
gonna not gonna be an early bird show

138.959 --> 143.84
and it might

139.76 --> 146.879
even not be on the flat earth debates

143.84 --> 149.76
because tomorrow is like move day

146.879 --> 151.67999999999998
for the storage to be fair not looking

149.76 --> 152.239
forward to it because it's always gonna

151.68 --> 157.44
stress

152.239 --> 160.08
the [ __ ] out of me

157.44 --> 161.92
yeah but yeah if it's going to be a

160.08 --> 163.76000000000002
little bit cooler at least that would be

161.92 --> 166.879
pleasant

163.76 --> 168.319
right but yeah going to start doing that

166.879 --> 170.64
like at

168.319 --> 172.72
a half past nine in the morning so i'm

170.64 --> 173.67999999999998
gonna be have to go up very early and

172.72 --> 175.28
all that and

173.68 --> 178.08
it's kind of better when it's this hot

175.28 --> 179.36
you know so i don't mind it like that

178.08 --> 182.64000000000001
it's just that

179.36 --> 183.28
i don't really like doing that because

182.64 --> 186.48
i'm gonna get

183.28 --> 189.599
feel pushed to throw away stuff again

186.48 --> 192.64
happens every single time

189.599 --> 193.51899999999998
and there's really nothing left so it's

192.64 --> 196.48
just gonna be

193.519 --> 197.04
like madness whenever that is pushed on

196.48 --> 199.04
me

197.04 --> 200.239
it's like yeah just destroy something

199.04 --> 203.28
that's precious to me

200.239 --> 205.92000000000002
for no damn good reason just destroyed

203.28 --> 208.879
only because it's like a little bit too

205.92 --> 211.04
difficult to store it somehow yeah

208.879 --> 213.12
that that's something that just drives

211.04 --> 216.239
me insane

213.12 --> 218.799
and anyway i'm considering

216.239 --> 219.68
getting my bed in here like anyway it's

218.799 --> 223.12
going to be

219.68 --> 224.08
quite a hassle though to do it but it

223.12 --> 226.159
would

224.08 --> 228.0
at least save my mattress which is a

226.159 --> 231.12
kind of a good one

228.0 --> 231.12
although it's very big

232.319 --> 238.0
but to reorganize my room like that's

234.64 --> 238.0
going to be quite a hassle

238.159 --> 241.67999999999998
it would look different if i would do

240.56 --> 245.2
that and it would

241.68 --> 245.20000000000002
take me maybe two days

248.72 --> 256.56
yeah how much difficulty and stress can

252.64 --> 261.919
just the lack of space cause

256.56 --> 261.919
how ridiculous is that really in this

266.84 --> 271.35999999999996
world

269.6 --> 274.40000000000003
but yeah don't worry about it i'll be

271.36 --> 277.52000000000004
back friday of course

274.4 --> 279.35999999999996
and uh we'll see where this goes

277.52 --> 281.28
but yeah tomorrow i'm just gonna be

279.36 --> 284.47900000000004
working all day

281.28 --> 287.84
it might be good to to really

284.479 --> 287.84
do some muscle work again

293.44 --> 300.16
anyway uh i got

296.56 --> 304.72
green tea with me and some

300.16 --> 308.84000000000003
fresh uh lemon squeezed

304.72 --> 311.84000000000003
uh water with honey

308.84 --> 311.84
hmm

312.88 --> 316.8
i kept it in the cooler for a while to

315.36 --> 325.6
cool it off extra because

316.8 --> 338.32
it warms up very quickly in this weather

325.6 --> 353.84000000000003
protesting maggot to what

338.32 --> 353.84
yeah you're gonna get a timeout for that

364.84 --> 369.44
so

366.56 --> 369.44
you too right

372.639 --> 377.759
so yeah what's going down i've been very

378.84 --> 383.52
distracted

380.4 --> 386.56
yeah man this whole situation

383.52 --> 386.96
with trying to order that fresh air

386.56 --> 389.84
thing

386.96 --> 391.12
it's it's driving me nuts because it

389.84 --> 394.4
seems like

391.12 --> 396.88
after testing everything there's like

394.4 --> 398.56
a virtual blockade between the united

396.88 --> 401.919
states

398.56 --> 406.479
and here in europe i think

401.919 --> 406.479
because yeah it's not coming through

406.72 --> 412.40000000000003
like there's the options to even order

410.56 --> 415.919
from outside of the united states

412.4 --> 418.23999999999995
at least infowars is just gone

415.919 --> 419.19899999999996
and there yeah i don't think it's the

418.24 --> 423.199
only

419.199 --> 427.12
the only place so yeah i'm gonna have to

423.199 --> 429.039
get it somewhere else in europe somehow

427.12 --> 430.319
or it's gonna have to be another system

429.039 --> 433.599
because it's just

430.319 --> 433.599
i can't get it anymore

434.0 --> 437.84
super weird it freaks me out

439.759 --> 443.759
it's like am i going to have to wait

441.44 --> 445.52
this one out until

443.759 --> 447.44
just the situation with shipping

445.52 --> 450.15999999999997
situations

447.44 --> 453.199
until that gets normal again will that

450.16 --> 453.199
happen at any point

453.36 --> 457.68
or does that simply mean there's no more

455.84 --> 465.84
internet

457.68 --> 465.84000000000003
shopping yeah transatlantic wise

471.199 --> 479.84000000000003
i don't know am i the only one noticing

474.08 --> 479.84
this or

480.56 --> 486.479
i don't know if anybody else had any

482.16 --> 486.47900000000004
trouble ordering things from abroad

489.44 --> 494.16
oh no missouri bear never heard of him

494.72 --> 497.84000000000003
there's a lot of people living in

496.72 --> 501.36
amsterdam and i

497.84 --> 507.84
know very very few of them

501.36 --> 507.84000000000003
or any at this point

519.279 --> 526.0
well i i got this weird creepy

522.32 --> 529.6800000000001
it's really creepy and airy feeling like

526.0 --> 531.2
they're just cutting off trade like

529.68 --> 533.4399999999999
they're just cutting it off like they're

531.2 --> 536.32
making it impossible

533.44 --> 536.32
to trade now

536.48 --> 541.839
and it's almost like a a breadline

540.32 --> 546.0
effect except it's

541.839 --> 550.32
not as tightened up not as bad as that

546.0 --> 553.44
but yeah it's like the the real

550.32 --> 557.44
peak efficiency of trade

553.44 --> 559.839
it's just god it's it's being demolished

557.44 --> 561.6800000000001
so there probably are a lot of people

559.839 --> 562.399
out there that have been trying to order

561.68 --> 565.68
things

562.399 --> 565.68
they're just not getting it

566.72 --> 571.519
that they've spent the money they're

568.24 --> 571.519
just not getting the product

574.399 --> 577.92
anyway if any of you in chat could

576.959 --> 581.68
testify

577.92 --> 582.3199999999999
to having or being in such a situation

581.68 --> 584.959
right now i

582.32 --> 587.279
i would like to know it because i don't

584.959 --> 589.04
want to feel like i'm the only one here

587.279 --> 591.6
like i'm being

589.04 --> 593.279
shadow boycotted or something like yeah

591.6 --> 595.44
yeah no you're arwin

593.279 --> 596.64
and nobody knows about you nobody's

595.44 --> 599.6800000000001
talking about you

596.64 --> 602.959
you know except for in your circles but

599.68 --> 605.1999999999999
yeah for no particular reason you just

602.959 --> 607.76
can't buy things anymore

605.2 --> 607.76
just no

609.04 --> 615.12
it's just not going to work anymore

612.56 --> 615.1199999999999
is that it

617.76 --> 633.8389999999999
is this some world social credit score

620.88 --> 633.8389999999999
choking effect that i'm now receiving

639.69 --> 642.839
[Music]

646.24 --> 652.88
took a really long time okay

649.279 --> 652.88
okay thank you ryan arthurton

655.839 --> 662.8800000000001

jeffrey bill i'm getting really sick of

662.88 --> 666.959
your

663.92 --> 669.68
squirting and [ __ ] it it's getting

666.959 --> 669.68
disgusting

670.079 --> 673.1999999999999
if that is all you have on your mind

671.76 --> 676.56
then maybe you should

673.2 --> 688.97
like go to water channels it's just

676.56 --> 690.7199999999999
getting really annoying at this point

688.97 --> 703.6800000000001
[Music]

690.72 --> 706.5600000000001
all right

703.68 --> 706.56
water channels

707.44 --> 717.839
what are you talking about

718.0 --> 723.6
yeah ryan arthurton he's been like that

720.079 --> 723.5999999999999
for for a month now

725.92 --> 730.7199999999999
i don't know ever ever i caught on to

728.32 --> 733.6800000000001
owen benjamin's

730.72 --> 734.48
like new joke legacy about the squirting

733.68 --> 737.12
and all that

734.48 --> 738.16
terminology ever kind of like i since i

737.12 --> 740.079
took that over like

738.16 --> 742.0
he seemed to have become obsessed with

740.079 --> 745.5999999999999
the word and now he that's just

742.0 --> 749.2
all he's doing he's he's

745.6 --> 751.12
he thinks it's funny but he's literally

749.2 --> 753.76
just thinking about squirting and

751.12 --> 756.079
squirting related things now

753.76 --> 757.279
and it's i'm not getting any other type

756.079 --> 760.16
of

757.279 --> 772.16
read from him at this point so yeah this

760.16 --> 774.88
is getting concerning

772.16 --> 775.519
anyway did i go through chat yet

774.88 --> 778.8
shouldn't do it

775.519 --> 780.48
right now right anyway dank was here

778.8 --> 784.4799999999999
first with his weird upside

780.48 --> 784.48
name upside down name

784.959 --> 790.8
amanda young good

788.32 --> 790.8000000000001
servant

791.76 --> 794.56
tom parker

794.88 --> 797.279
mukul

799.2 --> 804.639
missouri bear ryan arthurton

807.92 --> 812.8389999999999
yeah jeffrey bill don't know for how

811.12 --> 815.839
long but

812.839 --> 815.839
uh

816.24 --> 824.8
and a koala yeah i think that's

820.639 --> 829.839
that's it for now but i started early so

824.8 --> 829.8389999999999
we'll see

832.079 --> 843.8389999999999
on a plane

846.48 --> 849.36
okay right nurse

853.92 --> 857.8389999999999
cat in a box

858.56 --> 860.959
okay

866.399 --> 871.839
right so anyway uh yeah i named the

869.279 --> 871.8389999999999
title

872.8 --> 876.7199999999999
after the situation that happened

874.8 --> 880.7199999999999
yesterday with sleeping warriors

876.72 --> 882.0
stream uh where he got rumpus and bev in

880.72 --> 884.88
there

882.0 --> 887.519
and yeah rumpus just continually trying

884.88 --> 887.519
to argue

889.92 --> 893.4399999999999
continually trying to argue

894.8 --> 903.68
yeah how perpendicular basically

899.839 --> 903.6800000000001
could be circumdicular

905.04 --> 909.519
that's literally yeah i i got creative

907.519 --> 910.8
with the word i like spotted a word and

909.519 --> 914.5600000000001
just

910.8 --> 916.3199999999999
kept on spamming it making jokes with it

914.56 --> 918.2399999999999
with because it is freaking funny i

916.32 --> 920.5600000000001
thought

918.24 --> 922.44
it's like he's turning just

920.56 --> 925.4399999999999
perpendicular into

922.44 --> 928.72
circumdicular it yeah

925.44 --> 930.9590000000001
and come on remind

928.72 --> 931.759
the word remind it about anything

930.959 --> 934.56
probably

931.759 --> 940.88
well maybe that's the cause of uh

934.56 --> 943.7589999999999
jeffrey bale squirting

940.88 --> 947.12
yeah anyway the the naming is kind of an

943.759 --> 951.12
ode to owen benjamin at this point

947.12 --> 951.12
which will be blatantly obvious to the

952.839 --> 955.839
bears

959.279 --> 964.32
but yeah he just kept on arguing why

961.839 --> 967.44
perpendicular can be

964.32 --> 970.8000000000001
circular and and went to

967.44 --> 973.36
any length went very far

970.8 --> 976.399
it in really trying to put that down

973.36 --> 980.0790000000001
really solidifying the

976.399 --> 982.72
the framework idea for that

980.079 --> 983.279
and it yeah it was kind of good in a way

982.72 --> 987.9200000000001
to

983.279 --> 989.68
be able to hear rumpus put out his ideas

987.92 --> 991.519
relatively undisturbed because when

989.68 --> 994.88
there's a lot of other ballers in there

991.519 --> 997.44
they yeah start to get in his way or

994.88 --> 999.4399999999999
whatever it kind of retracts

997.44 --> 1002.0790000000001
and when he's on the debates well yeah

999.44 --> 1004.8000000000001
it usually just gets over shouted

1002.079 --> 1006.4799999999999
for good reason of course but still you

1004.8 --> 1008.4799999999999
never really get to hear

1006.48 --> 1010.16
like with his machinations of his mind

1008.48 --> 1013.12
and this way

1010.16 --> 1015.04
he was able to put out much more of that

1013.12 --> 1025.839
and it was kind of interesting to hear

1015.04 --> 1025.839
how that worked and ridiculous

1029.839 --> 1036.839
i i mean come on rumpus like as a person

1033.6 --> 1038.559
is kind of an aberration it's very

1036.839 --> 1041.28
unusual

1038.559 --> 1041.28
people like that

1042.559 --> 1047.28
like there's plenty of people that have

1044.64 --> 1049.8400000000001
rumpus traits you know but

1047.28 --> 1051.52
like the way he does it and what's tied

1049.84 --> 1067.84
in with all that

1051.52 --> 1067.84
yeah that's that's like very rare

1070.48 --> 1073.679
right yeah there was on the owen

1072.16 --> 1078.64
benjamin yesterday

1073.679 --> 1078.64
no tow in idaho that was

1078.84 --> 1081.84
silly

1087.039 --> 1090.64
okey-dokey missouri bear

1091.919 --> 1098.48
well i kind of just like to say

1095.28 --> 1099.36
bike thieves or be kind of just calling

1098.48 --> 1101.6
it black you know

1099.36 --> 1101.6
because

1102.96 --> 1110.16
but i i don't even like using the

1106.96 --> 1111.3600000000001
yeah word made me say it in that context

1110.16 --> 1114.4
because i just don't

1111.36 --> 1115.4399999999998
like it i don't like it when black

1114.4 --> 1118.5590000000002
people use it

1115.44 --> 1123.8400000000001
too i never really did it's just like

1118.559 --> 1123.84
why it's

1133.039 --> 1141.6
yep yeah that's the whole legend

1137.12 --> 1141.6
that's tied in with that right earth 10

1142.32 --> 1150.1599999999999
and it's it it look when you get into it

1145.36 --> 1154.0
it kind of becomes really funny

1150.16 --> 1159.6000000000001
yep yeah sure missouri bear

1154.0 --> 1159.6
you go ahead and do that it's very nice

1160.96 --> 1165.52
but anyway i don't know i like the idea

1163.28 --> 1168.8799999999999
of bike thief

1165.52 --> 1171.12
more because well the netherlands is

1168.88 --> 1173.44
like full of bikes

1171.12 --> 1173.4399999999998
and

1174.24 --> 1180.48
i don't know it's just funny

1178.559 --> 1183.12
and yeah i don't even want to go into

1180.48 --> 1186.16
the stats but there's probably

1183.12 --> 1189.36
something to it up to a certain degree

1186.16 --> 1190.0
with certain youths although it's not

1189.36 --> 1193.039
all

1190.0 --> 1196.96
yeah it's different here

1193.039 --> 1200.0
i guess maybe it's just like what is it

1196.96 --> 1203.76
uh bike saturation

1200.0 --> 1205.36
so that probably has a different effect

1203.76 --> 1207.679
there's probably still going to be bike

1205.36 --> 1209.9189999999999
thieving instincts

1207.679 --> 1211.679
just yeah getting afloat in the youth of

1209.919 --> 1214.48
old times you know when

1211.679 --> 1216.48
yeah you're getting naughty and [ __ ]

1214.48 --> 1218.88
testing limits and all that

1216.48 --> 1219.76
but yeah there's just an abundance of

1218.88 --> 1223.44
bikes so

1219.76 --> 1223.44
yeah there's never really any

1224.0 --> 1227.52
serious issues with that here

1230.4 --> 1235.8400000000001
have my family's black you're immune

1232.4 --> 1235.8400000000001
well that's cool

1239.52 --> 1246.559
yeah it's not the same over here like

1242.64 --> 1248.48
one of my uncles from my dad's side

1246.559 --> 1251.039
is married to a black woman like very

1248.48 --> 1253.2
black woman

1251.039 --> 1254.4
like a real deep african type i don't

1253.2 --> 1255.6000000000001
know from where

1254.4 --> 1257.8400000000001
you know it could be the congo or

1255.6 --> 1261.039
something but

1257.84 --> 1263.6
like yeah they don't use that

1261.039 --> 1264.559
they're not slaying they're like very

1263.6 --> 1269.4399999999998
tidy

1264.559 --> 1269.44
catholic types so

1269.84 --> 1277.84
yeah that's never going to work

1278.0 --> 1285.84
all right thank you awaken jaguar

1282.08 --> 1287.6
for the nice comment no i i just try to

1285.84 --> 1289.76
keep it lighthearted you know

1287.6 --> 1291.4399999999998
because yeah there's gotta be but that's

1289.76 --> 1294.24
the whole that's

1291.44 --> 1295.76
owen benjamin's sake it's uh what is it

1294.24 --> 1299.76
sacred

1295.76 --> 1302.4
cow slaughterhouse effect

1299.76 --> 1304.0
and yeah he's very very well equipped

1302.4 --> 1307.1200000000001
for that

1304.0 --> 1307.12
he knows what he's doing

1307.84 --> 1311.76
and i can really appreciate that to kind

1311.12 --> 1315.4399999999998
of like

1311.76 --> 1317.52
unravel the the tension

1315.44 --> 1318.48
get the squirting out of it as much as

1317.52 --> 1321.039
possible

1318.48 --> 1323.52
that's been increased through society

1321.039 --> 1328.1589999999999
and conditioning and all that [ __ ]

1323.52 --> 1330.96
and like that i appreciate it but like

1328.159 --> 1332.64
general derogatory approach i don't like

1330.96 --> 1336.48
it

1332.64 --> 1339.1200000000001
like like whatever reason you know every

1336.48 --> 1340.72
group has their problems and their good

1339.12 --> 1344.08
sides as well

1340.72 --> 1346.48
they're pinnacle individuals and their

1344.08 --> 1349.6789999999999
bottom feeder individuals every freaking

1346.48 --> 1349.679
group everyone

1350.96 --> 1355.8400000000001
so i just don't like doing that ever and

1353.84 --> 1359.52
i i kind of used to do that

1355.84 --> 1361.84
when i was much younger and i just

1359.52 --> 1362.799
because i thought like yeah yeah right

1361.84 --> 1365.12
that makes sense

1362.799 --> 1366.32
and until i figured out what i just said

1365.12 --> 1369.76
like no

1366.32 --> 1371.84
it's not right every freaking group

1369.76 --> 1373.52
you know every race if you want to call

1371.84 --> 1376.9599999999998
it race every group just

1373.52 --> 1379.2
has their great individuals

1376.96 --> 1380.32
and they're terrible individuals and

1379.2 --> 1383.919
yeah

1380.32 --> 1386.8799999999999
it's it's everywhere and

1383.919 --> 1388.88
more predominantly behavior towards this

1386.88 --> 1391.17
direction and more predominant behavior

1388.88 --> 1392.4
towards that direction with every group

1391.17 --> 1395.039
[Music]

1392.4 --> 1396.799
every group has their virtues and their

1395.039 --> 1400.72
problems

1396.799 --> 1400.72
and that's how i like to see it now

1400.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
gives me more peace

1407.12 --> 1410.3999999999999
but i do like to emphasize the

1409.6 --> 1412.08
difference too

1410.4 --> 1414.24
you know it's the difference is what

1412.08 --> 1418.1589999999999
makes us makes it all more

1414.24 --> 1423.2
unique this idea that should all be

1418.159 --> 1423.2
ignored unless it's standard that's

1428.84 --> 1436.559
terrible

1430.88 --> 1436.5590000000002
hmm hey spruce chemo that to real you

1438.24 --> 1445.84
kind of doubt it

1452.72 --> 1457.1200000000001
what what are you saying jeffrey bill

1457.44 --> 1464.0
ob has a problem with the truth really

1461.679 --> 1465.8400000000001
and he doesn't like eric either well i

1464.0 --> 1469.6
don't really like eric either

1465.84 --> 1471.36
as well okay doesn't mean i have a

1469.6 --> 1475.52
problem with the truth

1471.36 --> 1475.52
it's a very squirty thing to save you

1476.24 --> 1480.4
yeah you're not helping yourself here

1481.919 --> 1485.3600000000001
unless you are maneuvering to yeah an

1484.48 --> 1488.72
exit

1485.36 --> 1488.7199999999998
from being part of the show

1491.6 --> 1495.12
because i'm pretty sure that open

1493.12 --> 1498.4799999999998
benjamin is is not

1495.12 --> 1498.4799999999998
afraid of any truth

1499.76 --> 1506.32
he's more blunt straightforward than

1502.88 --> 1510.159
anyone i've ever met but he just

1506.32 --> 1515.76
he doesn't just shoot to make noise

1510.159 --> 1519.5200000000002
he aims he aims with a plan

1515.76 --> 1529.84
he's not globe earth sniper

1519.52 --> 1529.84
he actually knows what he's doing

1531.65 --> 1534.799
[Music]

1537.36 --> 1541.6
oh get out here that's that's the last

1541.12 --> 1557.84
drop

1541.6 --> 1557.84
jeffrey bill that's the last drop

1572.799 --> 1578.24
look nobody's making you

1576.08 --> 1580.8799999999999
like anyone and if you don't like owen

1578.24 --> 1582.96
benjamin if you don't like what he does

1580.88 --> 1585.279
or there's some something about him that

1582.96 --> 1588.0
just kind of hurts you you know

1585.279 --> 1589.6
that's fine you don't have to like him

1588.0 --> 1592.96
but you're not gonna talk

1589.6 --> 1597.039
[ __ ] about him

1592.96 --> 1599.76
on my show because i do like him

1597.039 --> 1601.12
i respect him for what he does and he's

1599.76 --> 1603.84
not perfect

1601.12 --> 1604.559
and very well aware of his flaws and so

1603.84 --> 1608.6399999999999
is he

1604.559 --> 1608.6399999999999
and that's something i can respect a lot

1609.52 --> 1613.279
and yeah there's a lot of bears in here

1612.4 --> 1615.44
too so

1613.279 --> 1615.44
just

1617.84 --> 1623.6
yeah it's not good what you're doing

1624.799 --> 1629.52
no jeffrey bill is not mccormack jeffrey

1626.96 --> 1632.96
bailey's jeffrey bill he's been

1629.52 --> 1632.96
here for ages

1634.08 --> 1641.6789999999999
and he doesn't have the trademark

1638.159 --> 1643.1200000000001
because jason mccormack absolutely very

1641.679 --> 1647.1200000000001
persistent

1643.12 --> 1651.12
in his trademarks i can spot him

1647.12 --> 1651.12
with any with any line he wrote

1652.08 --> 1655.36
most of the time unless he's

1653.36 --> 1657.36
specifically trying to suppress that but

1655.36 --> 1658.9599999999998
he's doing that specifically to get away

1657.36 --> 1662.24
with it

1658.96 --> 1663.279
if he does it no jeffrey bill is just

1662.24 --> 1664.72
jeffrey bale but

1663.279 --> 1668.0
yeah i don't want to see him for a while

1664.72 --> 1670.72
because it's just yeah

1668.0 --> 1672.68
it's not showing any respect this is not

1670.72 --> 1679.829
good

1672.68 --> 1679.829
[Music]

1680.0 --> 1685.12
okay chris matt i don't know who that is

1686.32 --> 1697.84

1705.12 --> 1711.279
all right thank you steli in 80 12.

1708.799 --> 1712.72
yeah things got very heated yesterday

1711.279 --> 1716.32
and i got very

1712.72 --> 1720.08
annoyed but yeah

1716.32 --> 1722.48
you know at least it seemed like

1720.08 --> 1723.12
yeah at least you were aware it was

1722.48 --> 1725.44
going on

1723.12 --> 1727.1999999999998
and you weren't pushing it too far on

1725.44 --> 1732.64
purpose

1727.2 --> 1739.8400000000001
so yeah that's all fine

1732.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
but yesterday got pretty heated yeah

1763.36 --> 1770.399
before i watched riley's show

1766.72 --> 1775.3600000000001
well yeah his show was very late so yeah

1770.399 --> 1781.84
i was drinking why

1775.36 --> 1781.84
i was just in chat so

1785.59 --> 1788.8
[Music]

1792.84 --> 1795.84
hmm

1818.679 --> 1822.96
okey-dokey i guess that answers your

1821.84 --> 1825.36
question dank

1822.96 --> 1827.43
well that's definitely not spurs chemo

1825.36 --> 1828.7199999999998
then

you very much for that

1840.08 --> 1846.8799999999999
jesus was a winemaker was he

1844.399 --> 1846.8799999999999
could be

1848.84 --> 1851.84
right

1861.2 --> 1866.88
oh you know with all drinking it it is

1864.559 --> 1869.44
always

1866.88 --> 1870.3200000000002
how are you doing it what is it costing

1869.44 --> 1872.64
you and

1870.32 --> 1873.6
are you keep on going when you can

1872.64 --> 1877.1200000000001
clearly

1873.6 --> 1878.1589999999999
see the cost ticking like on your health

1877.12 --> 1880.4799999999998
on your psychology

1878.159 --> 1883.7600000000002
and your social relations that's

1880.48 --> 1883.76
happening yeah that's bad

1885.76 --> 1890.559
but yeah i haven't been feeling like i'm

1888.799 --> 1893.279
being dragged down from

1890.559 --> 1893.9189999999999
from drinking it was kind of weird

1893.279 --> 1897.44
actually that

1893.919 --> 1901.279
when i started to drink wine again

1897.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
it's become kind of better yeah

1901.279 --> 1907.84
it was unexpected

1924.799 --> 1935.84
it's oh [ __ ] right here that's not good

1937.519 --> 1939.84
all right

1941.279 --> 1948.96
well i don't know dank

1944.88 --> 1951.8400000000001
wine is wine it's

1948.96 --> 1952.559
you can go further on wine that's true

1951.84 --> 1963.84
but

1952.559 --> 1963.84
i don't know

1979.36 --> 1983.1999999999998
the wine was so good it got compliment

1981.44 --> 1990.72
from the father of the bridegroom

1983.2 --> 2005.039
cool nice

1990.72 --> 2009.2
i didn't know that

2005.039 --> 2009.2
right but yeah you know

2010.88 --> 2016.24
for me like this idea

2014.0 --> 2017.279
that you gotta live in a very specific

2016.24 --> 2020.3990000000001
way you gotta do

2017.279 --> 2023.12
all these things in order to

2020.399 --> 2026.1589999999999
follow that specific blueprint for

2023.12 --> 2030.7199999999998
supposedly being a christian right

2026.159 --> 2033.919
well i kind of disagree i think

2030.72 --> 2035.519
it is more like a what is it a

2033.919 --> 2039.039
suggestion

2035.519 --> 2042.799
than an absolute rule it for me it was

2039.039 --> 2045.919
always about the logos about

2042.799 --> 2047.6
just the inherent effect of the design

2045.919 --> 2050.7200000000003
like if you do this

2047.6 --> 2051.1189999999997
that'll yield that benefit and this and

2050.72 --> 2053.919
that

2051.119 --> 2055.359
and that and if you do something else

2053.919 --> 2058.24
then you won't have that

2055.359 --> 2058.7999999999997
and you have to do with something else

2058.24 --> 2061.839
so

2058.8 --> 2063.76
i'm always kind of like just trying to

2061.839 --> 2066.159
balance things i realized like yeah

2063.76 --> 2068.5600000000004
drinking is not like good you know it's

2066.159 --> 2071.04
not like oh yeah let's drink

2068.56 --> 2072.96
until you drop that's that was always

2071.04 --> 2076.399
against that

2072.96 --> 2079.2
but i don't think it's like ooh

2076.399 --> 2080.72
if you're inebriated or something then

2079.2 --> 2083.7599999999998
you are

2080.72 --> 2087.04
going to be evil no i think what it does

2083.76 --> 2090.8790000000004
what alcohol is known to do is just

2087.04 --> 2091.44
take away the inhibitor so you're more

2090.879 --> 2094.48
open

2091.44 --> 2095.2000000000003
and what is inside of you will be will

2094.48 --> 2098.56
come out

2095.2 --> 2100.24
more quickly but yeah that if you got a

2098.56 --> 2101.119
lot of good inside of you then that will

2100.24 --> 2103.1189999999997
come out

2101.119 --> 2105.359
and if you have a lot of frustration

2103.119 --> 2107.2000000000003
with the world then that'll come out

2105.359 --> 2109.04
so whatever's inside of you will come

2107.2 --> 2111.52
out and if you are

2109.04 --> 2114.24
a creepy person with a lot of secrets

2111.52 --> 2117.7599999999998
that's really like having dark plants

2114.24 --> 2121.2
then that darkness and that spirit of

2117.76 --> 2125.6800000000003
conquering will come out

2121.2 --> 2125.68
that's what it does it just shows what's

2128.839 --> 2131.839
inside

2134.0 --> 2139.04
but yeah doing that also has just an

2137.359 --> 2142.24
influence on your

2139.04 --> 2143.119
physique and on your routines you know

2142.24 --> 2145.52
what you do

2143.119 --> 2146.56
so for a lot of people it just gets in

2145.52 --> 2149.359
the way too much

2146.56 --> 2149.359
so you stop it

2149.839 --> 2153.839
and yeah people look down to it

2152.48 --> 2157.119
sometimes

2153.839 --> 2158.0789999999997
like if if you're a drinker and you get

2157.119 --> 2160.32
yourself in

2158.079 --> 2162.32
social trouble or something yeah people

2160.32 --> 2163.92
will then start to look down

2162.32 --> 2165.839
like but yeah you're drinking and you're

2163.92 --> 2168.64
doing something bad and that's like the

2165.839 --> 2170.24
big stigmata

2168.64 --> 2173.839
unless you're in circles where nobody

2170.24 --> 2173.839
gives a [ __ ]

2177.839 --> 2181.359
but i i tried to just not be peer

2180.4 --> 2184.839
pressured you know

2181.359 --> 2186.48
like that it's like oh you should be

2184.839 --> 2189.04
drinking i'm like

2186.48 --> 2190.2400000000002
yeah but i don't drink too much when i

2189.04 --> 2192.72
do i pay the price

2190.24 --> 2195.04
quickly and try to recover it's not

2192.72 --> 2198.0789999999997
climbing

2195.04 --> 2200.56
i i've testified about it

2198.079 --> 2202.48
like oh i think i went too far and i'm

2200.56 --> 2205.2799999999997
just gonna cut it down and then i do and

2202.48 --> 2205.28
it gets better

2206.079 --> 2211.3590000000004
right well if if you can't

2209.2 --> 2213.1189999999997
handle it like that if you have too much

2211.359 --> 2214.0
trouble with it if it's too alluring

2213.119 --> 2229.839
yeah then you should

2214.0 --> 2229.839
just stay away

2240.839 --> 2246.88

i don't know by the way what this guy

2369.839 --> 2372.96
generally talks about

2373.92 --> 2379.44
yeah i saw the video from medical

2376.24 --> 2379.4399999999996
martial law he made one

2379.839 --> 2385.2
anyway a youtuber and he gave me a super

2382.96 --> 2385.2
chat

2388.88 --> 2397.839
oh what did i do wrong now

2404.56 --> 2411.839
for yours is a pint of beer okay

2413.92 --> 2416.2400000000002
right

2418.0 --> 2421.119
dude like i don't even spend that much

2420.4 --> 2424.2400000000002
money on

2421.119 --> 2427.44
on drink okay

2424.24 --> 2430.8799999999997
like really i don't

2427.44 --> 2433.28
it's like when i overdo it i get like

2430.88 --> 2434.56
oh i think i might be gonna drink a

2433.28 --> 2437.119
little bit too much

2434.56 --> 2439.359
you know and then i'll share with people

2437.119 --> 2440.96
like yeah this is the amount

2439.359 --> 2442.56
and they'll be like what that's

2440.96 --> 2446.4
literally nothing

2442.56 --> 2446.4
this is okay

2448.4 --> 2453.44
like two bottles of beer like half

2451.839 --> 2459.52
liters

2453.44 --> 2463.599
and yeah half a regular bottle of wine

2459.52 --> 2463.599
and that's already kind of a lot to me

2463.839 --> 2470.88
it's nothing no my just regular eating

2468.16 --> 2470.8799999999997
costs more

2478.319 --> 2483.92
why why i'm drinking well

2481.44 --> 2483.92
how about

2485.839 --> 2495.839
just because i don't know sometimes it's

2488.56 --> 2495.839
just more fun that way

2497.44 --> 2501.2000000000003
and i get a bit more jokey

2503.599 --> 2507.04
the word play especially you know when i

2505.44 --> 2509.359
drink alcohol i tend to do

2507.04 --> 2511.68
more wordplay it just happens it's like

2509.359 --> 2513.04
i get bored and just my intelligence

2511.68 --> 2515.7599999999998
starts

2513.04 --> 2518.96
frolicking around and [ __ ] yeah it

2515.76 --> 2518.96
typically happens when i got

2520.839 --> 2523.839
alcohol

2527.2 --> 2534.24
yeah that's right drink and drugs are

2530.079 --> 2534.2400000000002
not the way to jesus that's absolutely

2534.839 --> 2538.56
correct

2536.079 --> 2540.2400000000002
yeah if if jesus is what you're looking

2538.56 --> 2543.119
for specifically

2540.24 --> 2545.2799999999997
that's your quest then yeah drinking is

2543.119 --> 2548.079
not gonna help you

2545.28 --> 2548.8390000000004
because jesus is all about the truth and

2548.079 --> 2552.0
about

2548.839 --> 2555.119
self-confrontation and learning

2552.0 --> 2558.56
the consequences of actions

2555.119 --> 2559.92
and that learning process yeah elco gets

2558.56 --> 2562.7999999999997
in the way

2559.92 --> 2563.599
and you'll learn why because that's also

2562.8 --> 2566.7200000000003
in the bible

2563.599 --> 2570.8
like alcohol it's not bad

2566.72 --> 2579.839
but it can make you more susceptible to

2570.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
seductions it's very typical yeah

2583.28 --> 2589.0400000000004
not i know it's okay i do drink what i

2586.24 --> 2592.319
want that's right

2589.04 --> 2595.68
and i'm still a christian because i

2592.319 --> 2596.079
understand what that really means and as

2595.68 --> 2599.1189999999997
it's

2596.079 --> 2601.28
already been established yeah

2599.119 --> 2603.76
there's a lot of wine being made in the

2601.28 --> 2603.76
bible

2604.64 --> 2611.2799999999997
and can definitely be good but at the

2607.359 --> 2611.2799999999997
same time they also warn about it

2611.68 --> 2621.839
right it is how you drink exactly a menu

2629.54 --> 2632.73
[Music]

2632.839 --> 2639.04
uh

2635.44 --> 2639.04
yeah that's nice youtube

2643.92 --> 2649.599
and it is better to not constantly be

2647.359 --> 2651.04
have your body be subjected to alcohol

2649.599 --> 2654.4
because

2651.04 --> 2657.2799999999997
it does have a lot of influence on your

2654.4 --> 2658.4
metabolism especially on a cellular

2657.28 --> 2661.0400000000004
level

2658.4 --> 2662.0
it does a lot with your water workings

2661.04 --> 2663.839
and

2662.0 --> 2665.92
unfortunately if that keeps on

2663.839 --> 2667.599
persisting those extra processes that

2665.92 --> 2670.8
your body has to undergo

2667.599 --> 2673.599
to clean it up it makes you old

2670.8 --> 2673.599
it really does

2673.92 --> 2680.7200000000003
but slowly but yeah the older you get

2678.4 --> 2682.1600000000003
the more aggravated the effects of the

2680.72 --> 2684.72
alcohol become and

2682.16 --> 2685.44
so like pure liquor becomes very

2684.72 --> 2688.3999999999996
finessed

2685.44 --> 2691.04
it can be very dangerous but for some

2688.4 --> 2694.64
reason there's plenty of

2691.04 --> 2697.2
old folks that they'll just chuck down

2694.64 --> 2698.7999999999997
hard liquor anyway and they can still

2697.2 --> 2702.0789999999997
relatively grow old

2698.8 --> 2705.8390000000004
so yeah it really is all about

2702.079 --> 2705.8390000000004
how do you drink

2714.4 --> 2719.44
it's a solvent people are drinking

2716.079 --> 2722.2400000000002
solvents yeah

2719.44 --> 2722.96
effectively that's right it's it

2722.24 --> 2725.04
dissolves

2722.96 --> 2728.319
alcohol that's one of the primary

2725.04 --> 2731.04
functions it dissolves alcohol

2728.319 --> 2731.359
but in the body yeah that doesn't mean

2731.04 --> 2734.319
that

2731.359 --> 2734.64
it literally dissolves the alcohol or

2734.319 --> 2736.88
the

2734.64 --> 2738.48
uh the fat in your body and then takes

2736.88 --> 2741.52
that away or something now unfortunately

2738.48 --> 2743.76
does quite the opposite

2741.52 --> 2745.839
and besides the fats in your body in

2743.76 --> 2749.599
general

2745.839 --> 2752.88
actually contain a lot of stored

2749.599 --> 2756.079
vitamin mineral traces and all that and

2752.88 --> 2759.44
if you add alcohol to your body that

2756.079 --> 2762.4
stored stuff actually

2759.44 --> 2762.4
gets detrimented

2764.16 --> 2771.52
see yeah it's all so complex

2767.68 --> 2773.839
there's just so many effects so yeah

2771.52 --> 2775.359
you can go very long way on it if you do

2773.839 --> 2777.2
it the right way if you don't overdo it

2775.359 --> 2779.44
if you can find a real balance if you're

2777.2 --> 2782.16
not constantly trying to escape

2779.44 --> 2783.599
as you're drinking if you're just trying

2782.16 --> 2787.2
to find some joy with it

2783.599 --> 2787.2000000000003
and also let it go again

2787.44 --> 2791.599
if you can and if you can't if you're if

2790.16 --> 2794.48
you can't get a grip on it

2791.599 --> 2796.079
you're too distressed or you just can't

2794.48 --> 2799.28
do it yeah then stepping away

2796.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
is the only viable alternative if you

2799.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
can't handle it and step away

2809.2 --> 2812.45
turpentine is good for occasional drink

2811.2 --> 2814.8799999999997
woof

2812.45 --> 2817.5989999999997
[Music]

2814.88 --> 2819.359
it's it's uh it messes me up every time

2817.599 --> 2822.6400000000003
it's just cold like that

2819.359 --> 2822.64
like i don't know man

2823.92 --> 2827.6800000000003
yeah no it's not paint stripper that's

2826.64 --> 2830.0
isn't

2827.68 --> 2830.72
the turpentine that is said to be going

2830.0 --> 2833.52
around as

2830.72 --> 2835.52
to be used medically yeah because that

2833.52 --> 2839.52
is what it is

2835.52 --> 2845.28
is that isn't that just basically a

2839.52 --> 2848.8
miracle mineral supplement effectively

2845.28 --> 2850.88
isn't it pretty much the same stuff

2848.8 --> 2853.119
because it has to be very pure if you

2850.88 --> 2853.839
just take general pain thinner yeah

2853.119 --> 2856.88
that's just

2853.839 --> 2858.64
poison that's right that's why i

2856.88 --> 2860.0
don't really like you using the word

2858.64 --> 2861.52
turpentine because that's how most

2860.0 --> 2864.48
people know it it's just like yeah

2861.52 --> 2867.92
painter's turpentine no that's not

2864.48 --> 2872.48
that's that's not the right stuff

2867.92 --> 2875.44
just right mmm is bleach

2872.48 --> 2875.44
but it's very pure

2878.0 --> 2885.76
you know what it is right bleach

2882.24 --> 2888.319
the pure version it's basically oxygen

2885.76 --> 2893.0400000000004
that's what it is

2888.319 --> 2901.839
it's also what makes things so bleak

2893.04 --> 2901.839
oxygen reacts it's very reactive

2903.2 --> 2915.839
and that's why you also have to dissolve

2904.88 --> 2915.839
it in water

2926.839 --> 2929.839
so

2941.91 --> 2945.0699999999997
[Music]

2954.839 --> 2959.629
oh

2956.05 --> 2959.6290000000004
[Music]

2960.0 --> 2962.16
no

2963.359 --> 2966.4
and i'm i'm getting sick of this inquiry

2965.92 --> 2971.839
here

2966.4 --> 2971.839
it's just trolls

2982.64 --> 2986.4
now i i don't need trolls that are just

2985.28 --> 2989.52
gonna

2986.4 --> 2991.6800000000003
abuse my honesty and directness to try

2989.52 --> 2993.92
to lure me into saying something that

2991.68 --> 2995.839
would make me look like a freak

2993.92 --> 2997.52
yeah i know that's what you like doing

2995.839 --> 2998.7999999999997
it's like oh can we trick him today

2997.52 --> 3000.96
right

2998.8 --> 3002.7200000000003
yeah if i notice that you're you're

3000.96 --> 3003.599
doing that that you're maneuvering in

3002.72 --> 3005.839
that direction

3003.599 --> 3009.3590000000004
i'm just gonna ban you you can [ __ ] off

3005.839 --> 3013.839
if you if that's what you're here for

3009.359 --> 3013.839
all right

3038.839 --> 3041.839
okay

3046.88 --> 3051.119
why spurs has double gangers what

3051.2 --> 3056.0
now it's just a troll using his name as

3054.0 --> 3058.0
cover

3056.0 --> 3059.599
you know maybe some of the trolls are

3058.0 --> 3062.599
now confident that

3059.599 --> 3064.559
spurskimo has put himself down in a

3062.599 --> 3067.44
stereotypist fashion

3064.559 --> 3069.3590000000004
enough for them to find the confidence

3067.44 --> 3071.44
that they think that they can emulate

3069.359 --> 3074.48
him as a fake spurs chemo

3071.44 --> 3078.319
you know the more stereotypical

3074.48 --> 3080.64
people are more easy to emulate

3078.319 --> 3081.7599999999998
the more seduced some of the bastard

3080.64 --> 3086.16
trolls out there

3081.76 --> 3089.2000000000003
are to basically use them as a cover

3086.16 --> 3092.0
for real not just as like oh we're gonna

3089.2 --> 3093.9199999999996
bring out the typical figures and then

3092.0 --> 3094.96
make them in silly names and act like

3093.92 --> 3099.599
idiots but

3094.96 --> 3101.839
more genuinely yeah

3099.599 --> 3104.079
making the original person try to rub

3101.839 --> 3104.0789999999997
off

3105.44 --> 3111.599
on your ex and the more stereotypical

3109.28 --> 3112.4
you are the more easy to emulate the

3111.599 --> 3116.2400000000002
more

3112.4 --> 3116.2400000000002
trolls will try to attempt this

3119.52 --> 3125.839
yeah imitation

3128.319 --> 3132.88
yeah well it all depends you know that

3130.8 --> 3134.079
saying imitation is the sincerest form

3132.88 --> 3137.52
of flattery

3134.079 --> 3137.52
that only really works

3137.76 --> 3141.92
if yeah the person imitating is on the

3140.48 --> 3143.76
same level

3141.92 --> 3146.64
they're just doing it because it works

3143.76 --> 3146.96
well yeah then it is a form of flattery

3146.64 --> 3149.1189999999997
it's

3146.96 --> 3150.559
basically saying yeah you're you're

3149.119 --> 3151.04
doing something good i'm gonna do that

3150.559 --> 3153.28
too

3151.04 --> 3155.52
that's right but if it's actually

3153.28 --> 3158.4
somebody that's

3155.52 --> 3159.28
just out to destroy them and they're

3158.4 --> 3162.64
gonna

3159.28 --> 3167.8390000000004
create some kind of copy that's not

3162.64 --> 3167.839
that's not flattery

3167.92 --> 3171.28
that's an attempt at controlled

3170.079 --> 3174.7200000000003
opposition

3171.28 --> 3180.2000000000003
gaslighting straw man to destroy him

3174.72 --> 3183.29
that's not a compliment

3180.2 --> 3183.29
[Music]

3200.079 --> 3202.48
really

3202.58 --> 3205.75
[Music]

3206.839 --> 3209.839
dank

3213.52 --> 3217.53
are there certain words you really can't

3215.52 --> 3219.2
say anymore supposedly

3217.53 --> 3222.079
[Music]

3219.2 --> 3222.72
because there's two words banned in this

3222.079 --> 3226.48
chat

3222.72 --> 3229.04
but it's like every channel

3226.48 --> 3231.52
on the on youtube can determine which

3229.04 --> 3237.839
words they just want to be

3231.52 --> 3237.839
out of it entirely

3243.52 --> 3251.839
can you describe them what they're about

3276.839 --> 3279.839
okay

3290.839 --> 3293.839
so

3304.839 --> 3307.839
huh

3312.24 --> 3316.799
what oh is this about the bricks having

3316.4 --> 3320.96
been

3316.799 --> 3335.839
left by the police in the united states

3320.96 --> 3335.839
a weird situation is that about it

3346.839 --> 3349.839
what

3351.599 --> 3353.76
i

3356.16 --> 3359.359
i'm kind of lost as what you're talking

3358.64 --> 3363.839
about there

3359.359 --> 3363.839
dank it's getting a bit weird

3389.04 --> 3391.839
hmm

3393.119 --> 3399.119
yeah there's a certain name that is

3394.799 --> 3402.0
banned for blatantly obvious reasons

3399.119 --> 3402.6400000000003
just because because it's just being

3402.0 --> 3407.28
annoyed

3402.64 --> 3407.2799999999997
using used by trolls to annoy me

3407.92 --> 3419.839
and yeah the other words

3411.04 --> 3419.839
people understand

3427.599 --> 3430.88
nathan's chat blogs have the stuff i

3429.839 --> 3433.68
type well

3430.88 --> 3434.4
that's uh that's like holding text it's

3433.68 --> 3437.1189999999997
not really

3434.4 --> 3437.6800000000003
blocking it's not like the words are

3437.119 --> 3440.7200000000003
good

3437.68 --> 3442.96
yeah there's

3440.72 --> 3444.5589999999997
words that you can choose as this

3442.96 --> 3446.96
channel owner

3444.559 --> 3448.559
that'll just instantly remove your

3446.96 --> 3450.2400000000002
entire sentence you'll like

3448.559 --> 3453.8390000000004
you'll recognize it when there's no

3450.24 --> 3457.4399999999996
three dots beside your text

3453.839 --> 3457.44
that means it's like not visible

3458.24 --> 3463.68
it's not the same as holding back text

3461.28 --> 3464.96
because there is potential swear words

3463.68 --> 3467.68
in them

3464.96 --> 3468.16
and then a moderator or the channel

3467.68 --> 3470.64
owner

3468.16 --> 3472.96
has to approve it so that's a different

3470.64 --> 3476.0789999999997
system

3472.96 --> 3479.28
just holds back the text it all depends

3476.079 --> 3489.8390000000004
on if you want that

3479.28 --> 3489.8390000000004
you can turn it off

3492.3 --> 3495.369
[Music]

3514.839 --> 3517.839
what

3521.119 --> 3532.4
okay yout that's weird

3530.079 --> 3534.6400000000003
why you think nathan's channel might be

3532.4 --> 3535.9900000000002
run by the bbc

3534.64 --> 3538.16
holy [ __ ] man

3535.99 --> 3542.4799999999996
[Music]

3538.16 --> 3542.48
that is amazing oh

3542.839 --> 3549.2799999999997
well

3545.76 --> 3550.0
retina well in a way he might be kind of

3549.28 --> 3553.599
like one

3550.0 --> 3557.04
to attune to that level you know

3553.599 --> 3560.6400000000003
i do get i think i get that

3557.04 --> 3562.079
it's just like trying to uphold the high

3560.64 --> 3564.0789999999997
standard of the

3562.079 --> 3566.2400000000002
use of the words and all that now of

3564.079 --> 3568.1600000000003
course he is also nathan ranting in

3566.24 --> 3573.839
there so that doesn't really comply too

3568.16 --> 3573.839
much with the bbc guidelines

3577.44 --> 3582.0
but maybe the feel of it but i don't

3580.079 --> 3585.04
think

3582.0 --> 3586.0
that would be weird man like i can't

3585.04 --> 3589.2
even imagine

3586.0 --> 3590.0
like what the management in control of

3589.2 --> 3592.5589999999997
the bbc

3590.0 --> 3593.76
would be thinking as they would engage

3592.559 --> 3597.2000000000003
like something like that

3593.76 --> 3601.92
it's like yeah let's get this guy

3597.2 --> 3606.3999999999996
like we could get somewhere with that

3601.92 --> 3606.4
what no

3608.559 --> 3612.88
but he does seem to be like against

3611.079 --> 3614.88
conspiracy theories

3612.88 --> 3616.96
specifically having that attitude which

3614.88 --> 3620.079
is kind of like a more

3616.96 --> 3623.44
casual statist approach

3620.079 --> 3625.3590000000004
at that specifically but yeah at the

3623.44 --> 3627.52
same time in these days there is a lot

3625.359 --> 3630.72
of just blank assertion

3627.52 --> 3633.7599999999998
conspiracy paranoia going around as well

3630.72 --> 3636.0
there's a lot of people just doing that

3633.76 --> 3637.76
and i don't like it when people do that

3636.0 --> 3638.0
it's very annoying it makes me feel like

3637.76 --> 3640.8390000000004
i'm

3638.0 --> 3643.599
just watching a bunch of savonia

3640.839 --> 3646.0789999999997
squirting really and yeah a lot of

3643.599 --> 3648.2400000000002
people do that including some of you

3646.079 --> 3651.44
have that tendency

3648.24 --> 3653.68
i hope you know that you have it's not

3651.44 --> 3653.68
good

3654.839 --> 3660.64
but

3656.559 --> 3663.599
yeah i it's just

3660.64 --> 3666.0
nah the only way that could even work is

3663.599 --> 3668.079
if nathan would just completely take out

3666.0 --> 3670.319
the rage aspect of his show and then

3668.079 --> 3673.6800000000003
there would be no show

3670.319 --> 3673.68
not like it was

3673.839 --> 3681.92
so no i'm pretty sure he's not run by

3677.359 --> 3681.92
bbc but i thought it was a very funny

3682.839 --> 3685.839
idea

3690.64 --> 3699.839
what is that

3704.319 --> 3713.839
crayon wrenching clown kiwi is a korean

3708.64 --> 3713.839
is it so all right

3723.28 --> 3729.8390000000004
right yeah uh no good servant

3726.319 --> 3731.52
you got him wrong my skype address

3729.839 --> 3733.839
is in the description box below it

3731.52 --> 3734.4
should be visible just on the youtube

3733.839 --> 3737.2
page

3734.4 --> 3738.48
you should be able to see it and it's

3737.2 --> 3741.0389999999998
it's not with an ij

3738.48 --> 3744.799
my skype address my name is but the

3741.039 --> 3748.3190000000004
skype address is actually with a y

3744.799 --> 3748.319
i know it's a little confusing

3748.799 --> 3755.839
but yeah the ij ones were taken and

3752.839 --> 3755.839
corrupted

3765.32 --> 3768.3790000000004
[Music]

3785.119 --> 3792.7200000000003
yet yes youtube well

3788.4 --> 3794.7200000000003
same group i think it's just a

3792.72 --> 3798.24
a bunch of bored people that kind of

3794.72 --> 3800.5589999999997
just by accident end up together

3798.24 --> 3803.359
and then joining forces as they waste

3800.559 --> 3803.3590000000004
everyone's time

3804.079 --> 3810.7200000000003
i think that's really what's going on

3805.839 --> 3814.64
with these trolls it's just

3810.72 --> 3817.52
the trolls are not agents they're just

3814.64 --> 3819.359
doofuses that have no proper way to

3817.52 --> 3821.68
utilize their intelligence

3819.359 --> 3823.0389999999998
in any creative fashion to enrich their

3821.68 --> 3825.52
own lives

3823.039 --> 3826.7990000000004
so they just wasted on it on this kind

3825.52 --> 3830.0
of nonsense

3826.799 --> 3833.2
and by them per default getting in

3830.0 --> 3833.76
our way they're kind of helping out the

3833.2 --> 3836.72
system

3833.76 --> 3840.0
which wants as much things in our way as

3836.72 --> 3842.24
possible and they're doing it naturally

3840.0 --> 3843.28
so the system is just counting on these

3842.24 --> 3852.319
people to be

3843.28 --> 3867.8390000000004
exactly as idiotic as they are

3852.319 --> 3867.839
that's what i think is really going on

3868.079 --> 3872.6400000000003
yes ana koala i have seen martin kenny's

3870.88 --> 3877.039
theory of earth

3872.64 --> 3877.0389999999998
the orb theory right with the multiple

3878.839 --> 3895.839
layers but it is

3880.72 --> 3895.839
circle-centric though

3900.559 --> 3904.48
hmm yeah right earthen didn't you know

3905.359 --> 3909.839
good servant is doing shows all the time

3929.76 --> 3933.6800000000003
well youtube you know it's it's kind of

3931.92 --> 3937.2000000000003
weird

3933.68 --> 3941.2
i think there it like they're

3937.2 --> 3944.0
the controller section is pretty divided

3941.2 --> 3945.2799999999997
about the flatter scene i think there's

3944.0 --> 3947.76
a lot of people that like

3945.28 --> 3949.3590000000004
money they don't like it because it gets

3947.76 --> 3949.76
in the way but i think there's a lot of

3949.359 --> 3952.5589999999997
very

3949.76 --> 3953.92
smart people that are frustrated with

3952.559 --> 3957.28
the lies in the world

3953.92 --> 3959.52
that are among the more powerful as well

3957.28 --> 3961.039
that just have the opposite opinion and

3959.52 --> 3964.64
actually kind of appreciate

3961.039 --> 3967.119
what we do because we are basically

3964.64 --> 3970.5589999999997
expressing their frustration about how

3967.119 --> 3970.559
stupid these people are

3971.92 --> 3975.039
because they're being confronted with

3973.44 --> 3978.0
that [ __ ] constantly and

3975.039 --> 3979.2000000000003
yeah they have to uphold their face or

3978.0 --> 3981.68
their

3979.2 --> 3983.5989999999997
management position or whatever you know

3981.68 --> 3985.68
but they're frustrated probably all the

3983.599 --> 3987.52
time by just how freaking stupid people

3985.68 --> 3990.72
can be

3987.52 --> 3994.96
and just the general public even

3990.72 --> 3997.2
so i think they kind of appreciate it

3994.96 --> 3998.48
like i appreciate it like that as well

3997.2 --> 4001.359
and yeah i don't

3998.48 --> 4002.96
i'm not really in a particular position

4001.359 --> 4004.72
where i'm constantly being confronted

4002.96 --> 4008.0
with idiots

4004.72 --> 4009.9199999999996
outside of the ballers as a natural

4008.0 --> 4011.68
consequences of doing these shows and

4009.92 --> 4013.52
being on the flatter debates

4011.68 --> 4015.7599999999998
which by the way has just started up so

4013.52 --> 4017.599
i'm gonna round out the show

4015.76 --> 4019.599
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4017.599 --> 4020.7200000000003
liked the show i thought it was kind of

4019.599 --> 4022.2400000000002
