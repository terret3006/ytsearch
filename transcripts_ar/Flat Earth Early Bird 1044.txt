sort of above me or this fluffy little

113.52 --> 117.439
sheep clouds

115.28 --> 120.399
then they transition into that

117.439 --> 124.0
perfectly blue region and then behind

120.399 --> 124.0
there is another wall of clouds

126.159 --> 129.479
it's funny

129.92 --> 136.44
it's like all the way as well

132.0 --> 136.44
so yeah it's been nice and sunny

142.959 --> 148.08
it's not getting any warmer though

145.84 --> 151.12
also i've been noticing that yeah the

148.08 --> 152.8
leaf falling has actually started

151.12 --> 156.31900000000002
if you look around there's a whole bunch

152.8 --> 158.8
of trees that have now definitely

156.319 --> 161.67999999999998
change their color more towards yellow

158.8 --> 161.68
and red and brown

162.0 --> 165.68
it happened pretty quickly

168.959 --> 175.599
so yeah autumn has definitely

172.64 --> 175.599
started out there

177.2 --> 182.48
hello jazz will soaring first in chat

180.72 --> 185.84
man beardella

182.48 --> 185.84
good to see you

185.92 --> 192.51899999999998
it is saturday the 16th

188.72 --> 192.519
of october 2021

196.56 --> 200.08
and yeah we'll see what we're going to

198.64 --> 204.48
talk about

200.08 --> 204.48000000000002
had a lot to think about since yesterday

206.159 --> 208.56
also

209.2 --> 214.23899999999998
it was funny because sean hawkins

211.76 --> 217.67999999999998
actually caught me out on an anger on an

214.239 --> 217.68
error a language error

219.36 --> 223.76000000000002
at first i didn't even spot it just

221.599 --> 226.56
thought oh what are you doing now but i

223.76 --> 228.319
actually made a language error i said

226.56 --> 232.0
virulent

228.319 --> 235.2
when i meant to say veril

232.0 --> 237.04
fear isle how do you say that yeah

235.2 --> 238.879
and now yeah of course

237.04 --> 241.2
being dutch

238.879 --> 244.959
seems very close even though it's

241.2 --> 246.79899999999998
actually quite the opposite in meaning

244.959 --> 248.879
but yeah

246.799 --> 251.59900000000002
most of the times i think i might be

248.879 --> 253.28
making some kind of a language mistake

251.599 --> 255.67999999999998
and then i look it up and i actually got

253.28 --> 258.239
it right one this case i did make a

255.68 --> 261.28000000000003
language mistake and i didn't realize it

258.239 --> 264.15999999999997
not even directly afterward

261.28 --> 264.15999999999997
so that happens

264.639 --> 268.8
right the rest of my show yesterday i

266.32 --> 272.08
thought was great

268.8 --> 272.08
very satisfied about it

273.919 --> 279.0
i did get quite a few comments too

290.0 --> 293.0
hmm

301.44 --> 305.44
right also i've been watching that it

303.759 --> 308.0
was emailed to me

305.44 --> 310.4
watching the footage back

308.0 --> 314.16
in the interview he did

310.4 --> 314.15999999999997
on news channels afterward

314.24 --> 318.24
it wasn't as bad as i thought it would

316.08 --> 318.24
be

319.28 --> 322.15999999999997
it really wasn't

323.199 --> 327.039
anyway

324.96 --> 330.4
all right so yeah i didn't join the

327.039 --> 330.4
flight of the [ __ ] yesterday

331.84 --> 336.56
but i was

333.199 --> 336.56
listening in the background

337.12 --> 341.84000000000003
and when like the uh live show ended i

339.68 --> 343.52
did also go on discord to continue

341.84 --> 346.0
listening

343.52 --> 348.56
and just to see like how they would do

346.0 --> 348.56
without me

348.639 --> 353.28000000000003
and became very apparent to me after a

351.039 --> 356.479
while that they were missing my

353.28 --> 356.479
diplomacy skills

358.4 --> 361.67999999999995
nah it's not so much

360.319 --> 363.759
just kidding

361.68 --> 366.759
anyway

363.759 --> 366.759
uh

371.759 --> 375.24
where's everybody

381.84 --> 384.84
um

415.36 --> 420.72
did everybody get a really late night

417.68 --> 420.72
last night or something

421.28 --> 423.84
stayed up

427.52 --> 431.19899999999996
because

428.88 --> 434.919
i'm surprised that's only two people in

431.199 --> 434.91900000000004
my chat right now

442.639 --> 445.039
whatever

446.0 --> 449.88
hey stone monkey 3d

463.52 --> 467.68
the sun is moving away is it

470.16 --> 477.0
hey mike sudonic

472.08 --> 477.0
good to see you gaining wisdom right

486.8 --> 489.8
hmm

503.49 --> 509.479
[Music]

506.08 --> 509.479
hello clutch

528.8 --> 532.8
right

530.32 --> 535.839
so i'm trying to cut down on going to

532.8 --> 535.8389999999999
bed late

536.24 --> 542.8
yeah it wasn't great yes yeah well

539.279 --> 542.8
i had a lot of fun in the night

543.519 --> 546.72
playing a game and it's going really

545.44 --> 548.48
well

546.72 --> 552.0
finally starting to get

548.48 --> 552.0
the hang of the balance of it

552.08 --> 555.9200000000001
pathfinder king maker

554.8 --> 558.16
uh

555.92 --> 560.24
i basically restarted the game and now

558.16 --> 563.8389999999999
as a paladin

560.24 --> 566.08
actually doing that

563.839 --> 566.08
uh

566.959 --> 569.8389999999999
hey isles g

570.959 --> 577.56
right

573.04 --> 577.56
and yesterday was plenty of shows

579.519 --> 582.48
kept me busy

582.88 --> 586.16
i met you from australia

586.32 --> 591.36
did basically a

588.959 --> 594.0
a homesteader show

591.36 --> 596.24
with his wife why pre-recorded it

594.0 --> 598.16
and then somewhere halfway

596.24 --> 600.0
the recording just

598.16 --> 603.0
something went wrong but he's restarted

600.0 --> 603.0
up

605.12 --> 607.92
but yeah

608.48 --> 612.8000000000001
that was cool and made by jim bob was

610.959 --> 615.4399999999999
also live i really sat through that

612.8 --> 615.4399999999999
whole show

616.959 --> 619.8389999999999
that was great

621.519 --> 626.24
oh yeah i also visited jose

624.32 --> 627.7600000000001
jg

626.24 --> 632.279
for a bit

627.76 --> 632.279
just to see what was going to be said

637.2 --> 639.519
uh

644.48 --> 648.88
what else yeah and and the rest yeah i

646.959 --> 652.0
was kind of listening to infowars on the

648.88 --> 655.8
background while playing the game etc

652.0 --> 655.8
and just multitasking

662.16 --> 668.0
and thinking about yesterday's show and

664.48 --> 668.0
the day before like

670.959 --> 674.56
like the whole william shatner situation

673.519 --> 678.16
is like

674.56 --> 678.16
i thought it was very revealing

680.88 --> 684.079
like how easily

686.0 --> 689.839
like flat earthers have

692.16 --> 696.8
like default responses

694.48 --> 698.88
to just date now it's all fake it's like

696.8 --> 701.519
nothing happened it's all fake

698.88 --> 703.76
because that is happening out there

701.519 --> 705.44
standing out to me i find it very

703.76 --> 708.3199999999999
disappointing

705.44 --> 710.399
because to me that's a sign of weakness

708.32 --> 713.839
and i did discuss that

710.399 --> 713.839
yesterday on yesterday's show

714.24 --> 718.32
but it has just gotten me thinking a lot

717.44 --> 721.2790000000001
like

718.32 --> 721.279
this is a problem

722.079 --> 726.6389999999999
how do we all overcome this problem

728.16 --> 731.8389999999999
and what what is causing it

732.8 --> 737.1999999999999
it was a good acting performance at the

734.72 --> 737.2
end yeah

741.36 --> 747.279
alex jones

743.04 --> 747.279
is a joke yeah well

751.279 --> 757.48
he seems to be aiming for a certain

753.68 --> 757.4799999999999
frequency public

758.56 --> 760.88
and

763.279 --> 769.279
in ways yes he has become a joke but

767.04 --> 771.5999999999999
in other ways he still has serves a

769.279 --> 774.16
function

771.6 --> 777.839
but if he like muddies his own waters

774.16 --> 782.36
too much it's just gonna be unbearable

777.839 --> 782.36
it it sometimes already is

793.68 --> 799.959
hello george sanford

796.32 --> 799.9590000000001
one for our unit

813.279 --> 816.72
else do i have a favorite color really

815.839 --> 818.9590000000001
no

816.72 --> 822.5600000000001
not really

818.959 --> 824.399
it all depends on my mood really

822.56 --> 826.2399999999999
i mean there's sets of colors that i do

824.399 --> 827.519
typically appreciate

826.24 --> 830.0
but

827.519 --> 833.88
no i've no i do not have a singular

830.0 --> 833.88
favorite color now

884.24 --> 889.399
okay

885.6 --> 889.399
just will soaring

907.6 --> 910.6
hmm

920.88 --> 925.04
well i can't blame you about that i do

923.68 --> 927.199
appreciate

925.04 --> 930.48
green in nature

927.199 --> 933.68
i don't like the color

930.48 --> 935.839
when it's not natural though

933.68 --> 937.04
i don't like green paint

935.839 --> 940.5600000000001
i like

937.04 --> 943.12
green tree leaves

940.56 --> 945.5999999999999
and grass

943.12 --> 949.04
those are the colors i like to see

945.6 --> 952.639
but i don't like it when it's painted

949.04 --> 955.8389999999999
it's very rare that i like something

952.639 --> 955.839
if it's painted green

957.759 --> 965.8000000000001
but it is it can be doable

961.759 --> 965.8000000000001
because green is just a

968.079 --> 973.68
a color

970.48 --> 973.6800000000001
for which our brain

973.92 --> 978.24
is kind of made to make more precise

976.639 --> 980.88
distinction between the color

978.24 --> 980.88
differences

981.6 --> 985.9200000000001
and so it's very difficult to basically

984.56 --> 987.199
paint green

985.92 --> 988.24
right

987.199 --> 992.079
because

988.24 --> 994.0
just this tiny little difference

992.079 --> 995.04
just makes it completely different to

994.0 --> 998.24
the brain

995.04 --> 998.24
that's what i think about it

999.12 --> 1003.279
anyway

1000.32 --> 1003.279
hello dx

1004.079 --> 1011.7589999999999
very intriguing about turquoise

1007.36 --> 1011.759
my mother thought so too i'll see

1016.16 --> 1020.7199999999999
i had a phase two

1017.839 --> 1023.0400000000001
where i didn't like turquoise a lot

1020.72 --> 1025.839
in like my very early teens and

1023.04 --> 1025.839
pre-teens

1026.079 --> 1031.839
in my pre-teens i could say that

1027.919 --> 1031.8390000000002
turquoise was my favorite color

1035.679 --> 1039.8390000000002
but yeah i grew out of it

1086.48 --> 1090.64
all right so we're talking about callers

1088.4 --> 1090.64
now

1092.32 --> 1095.48
i guess

1104.88 --> 1109.679
or maybe this is just going to be a show

1106.64 --> 1112.72
where i'm kind of just laid back

1109.679 --> 1116.919
oh moon refraction theory

1112.72 --> 1116.919
you picked up on that did you

1132.32 --> 1137.84
yeah it's just it's basically a joke

1135.28 --> 1140.84
moving fraction theory i hope that's

1137.84 --> 1140.84
obvious

1160.16 --> 1164.96
did i watch

1161.52 --> 1170.679
launch of lucy no

1164.96 --> 1170.679
trojan asked what no didn't know that

1178.4 --> 1180.64
what

1183.44 --> 1186.559
i had no idea

1189.679 --> 1194.3200000000002
it's the first time i'm hearing about it

1191.6 --> 1194.32
moonshadow

1195.2 --> 1198.64
like who's doing it

1201.28 --> 1205.24
who's organizing it

1219.039 --> 1223.919
okay jaz wilson what do i think about

1221.76 --> 1227.2
rob skiba passing away i

1223.919 --> 1228.4
have to keep on bringing that up but

1227.2 --> 1230.8500000000001
yeah

1228.4 --> 1233.92
i think it's kind of shocking

1230.85 --> 1233.9199999999998
[Music]

1234.24 --> 1238.799
i'm reluctant to make any like

1235.919 --> 1240.0800000000002
definitive declarations about it

1238.799 --> 1242.24
but

1240.08 --> 1244.32
i do think it's kind of suspicious the

1242.24 --> 1246.559
circumstances

1244.32 --> 1248.799
in which he died in the sense that i

1246.559 --> 1250.72
think he might have been

1248.799 --> 1254.72
become

1250.72 --> 1256.799
a victim of the current system

1254.72 --> 1258.799
but i don't know for sure i didn't get

1256.799 --> 1260.8799999999999
any other data than

1258.799 --> 1262.799
what was told to me that he was kept in

1260.88 --> 1264.7990000000002
an artificial coma and he had lung

1262.799 --> 1267.039
issues and

1264.799 --> 1269.9189999999999
it just feels like to me

1267.039 --> 1272.1589999999999
like he accidentally got rolled into the

1269.919 --> 1274.4
the death care system i'm just gonna

1272.159 --> 1277.4
very roughly call it the the bad

1274.4 --> 1277.4
protocols

1280.64 --> 1284.3200000000002
that is really what it is the bad

1282.24 --> 1285.84
medical protocols that were sneaked in

1284.32 --> 1286.96
it

1285.84 --> 1289.36
funded and

1286.96 --> 1294.0
moved in there and it's now

1289.36 --> 1294.0
getting exposed and active basically

1294.32 --> 1301.52
it's very dark

1296.88 --> 1301.5200000000002
and it's worldwide almost entirely

1303.2 --> 1306.799
all right i did by the way also had a

1304.88 --> 1309.44
conversation

1306.799 --> 1311.28
with my roommate yesterday about that

1309.44 --> 1314.72
and she was totally

1311.28 --> 1317.12
like she was very interested

1314.72 --> 1318.48
in like a summary of medical history how

1317.12 --> 1321.6789999999999
it started with the

1318.48 --> 1322.72
rockefeller foundation and the red cross

1321.679 --> 1325.52
how they

1322.72 --> 1326.88
manifested allopathic medical medical

1325.52 --> 1329.36
system

1326.88 --> 1330.96
and protocols the typical standardized

1329.36 --> 1333.6789999999999
protocols

1330.96 --> 1335.6000000000001
and yeah i managed to basically present

1333.679 --> 1336.799
that and then connect it into where we

1335.6 --> 1339.9189999999999
are now

1336.799 --> 1343.28
how that happened pretty recently

1339.919 --> 1343.2800000000002
and i think she really got it

1343.36 --> 1347.84
i like i really like her

1348.72 --> 1354.72
almost made her be late to go yeah

1351.84 --> 1357.12
almost made her miss the bus

1354.72 --> 1360.44
or the train whatever

1357.12 --> 1360.4399999999998
but uh

1361.12 --> 1364.559
that also happened yesterday

1364.799 --> 1371.9189999999999
right george yes i saw the the rob skip

1367.919 --> 1373.679
video from 2015 as well yeah

1371.919 --> 1376.3200000000002
but he wasn't the only one back then

1373.679 --> 1380.0800000000002
there were plenty of people that make

1376.32 --> 1380.08
were making such predictions

1380.559 --> 1386.1589999999999
yeah technically alex jones did that

1382.4 --> 1386.159
even five years before that

1387.76 --> 1390.96
for whatever that's worth

1393.76 --> 1398.1589999999999
so i i kind of remember that time with

1396.559 --> 1401.28
rob skiba when he did that everybody

1398.159 --> 1402.7990000000002
seemed to be so impressed i was like

1401.28 --> 1406.1589999999999
yeah

1402.799 --> 1406.1589999999999
i kind of already know

1408.4 --> 1414.0
but of course seeing it back after

1410.4 --> 1414.0
everything that's happened yeah it is

1414.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
it is an interesting reminder

1434.64 --> 1437.679
okay moonshadow

1438.159 --> 1442.88
united launch alliance

1441.039 --> 1444.72
never heard of that what is that is that

1442.88 --> 1447.6000000000001
some

1444.72 --> 1447.6000000000001
other company

1455.36 --> 1459.7199999999998
united launch alliance

1460.32 --> 1463.96
ok is national

1488.08 --> 1492.48
wow they have a lot of footage on their

1490.159 --> 1492.48
site

1493.679 --> 1497.52
all right so it is also commercial

1495.44 --> 1500.8400000000001
operation i noticed

1497.52 --> 1500.84
some advertisement

1514.76 --> 1522.36
140 launches why have i absolutely never

1518.72 --> 1522.3600000000001
heard of them before

1528.88 --> 1531.3600000000001
let's see

1534.919 --> 1539.7990000000002
2006

1536.799 --> 1539.799
what

1542.88 --> 1548.96
wow so they've been launching things

1544.96 --> 1552.1000000000001
since 2006. i have never ever heard of

1548.96 --> 1556.24
this group before that's really weird

1552.1 --> 1561.4399999999998
[Music]

1556.24 --> 1561.44
west coast californian hmm all right

1567.039 --> 1570.2
all right

1572.64 --> 1575.76
all right just for the record

1576.24 --> 1579.72
let me link

1593.12 --> 1596.279
all right

1609.84 --> 1617.9599999999998
pacific splash splashdowns get it what

1614.32 --> 1617.96
what do you mean with that

1648.69 --> 1653.5
[Music]

1669.12 --> 1674.799
funny how the website looks nearly

1671.039 --> 1677.039
identical to the blue origin one

1674.799 --> 1677.039
hmm

1679.84 --> 1684.6399999999999
well maybe they're like from the same

1682.08 --> 1686.48
operational branch

1684.64 --> 1689.039
right so there seems to be

1686.48 --> 1691.2
multiple players out there that are

1689.039 --> 1693.44
doing this sort of thing

1691.2 --> 1695.679
and they probably

1693.44 --> 1697.52
formed a little guild on like how to do

1695.679 --> 1701.52
this and

1697.52 --> 1701.52
this might simply be another branch

1701.919 --> 1706.159
that apparently was out there

1704.08 --> 1708.07
since 2006 even though i've never heard

1706.159 --> 1711.2600000000002
of it before

1708.07 --> 1711.26
[Music]

1720.72 --> 1727.2
i did see an amazon logo on one of the

1723.679 --> 1727.2
rockets on their website

1728.88 --> 1733.6000000000001
so they don't seem to be strict

1730.96 --> 1737.32
competitors

1733.6 --> 1737.32
concerning that

1748.159 --> 1751.159
so

1753.44 --> 1757.52
uh

1754.799 --> 1760.559
well dx

1757.52 --> 1762.48
it was like premiered

1760.559 --> 1766.76
don't know which one

1762.48 --> 1766.76
i'm gonna try to find it back

1776.96 --> 1784.88
somebody i think adam posted it

1780.48 --> 1788.76
in skype let me try to find it back

1784.88 --> 1788.7600000000002
oh no no wait it was

1795.039 --> 1798.24
it was sleeping warrior

1803.039 --> 1806.96
a post from geoworld so here is that

1805.76 --> 1809.919
clip

1806.96 --> 1812.919
if you wanted to check it out

1809.919 --> 1812.919
dx

1857.279 --> 1862.679
he sent you to flat earth banners diddy

1859.679 --> 1862.679
cool

1876.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
hey america silver patriot

1887.2 --> 1890.2
what

1896.0 --> 1901.64
what didn't you just say joe will i'm

1898.159 --> 1901.64
sorry this

1918.84 --> 1922.559
oh right

1921.519 --> 1924.48
gate

1922.559 --> 1928.1589999999999
that was hilarious you accidentally

1924.48 --> 1930.96
wrote they were my only gays

1928.159 --> 1930.96
for two years

1931.76 --> 1934.24
uh

1933.279 --> 1937.039
auto

1934.24 --> 1940.279
spelling right

1937.039 --> 1940.279
that's hilarious

1970.0 --> 1973.12
what do you mean by the way someone took

1972.0 --> 1975.84
them

1973.12 --> 1980.36
you mean somebody stole your banners or

1975.84 --> 1980.36
you gave them away like what

1996.0 --> 1999.0
so

2020.64 --> 2024.48
you ever seen that before clutch right

2022.48 --> 2026.24
well this is from the beginning that

2024.48 --> 2028.48
like that

2026.24 --> 2030.159
was from the period where we all had

2028.48 --> 2033.48
this massive

2030.159 --> 2036.96
awakening boost like the early

2033.48 --> 2039.519
2015 and 16 even

2036.96 --> 2043.08
you can't imagine how much energy was in

2039.519 --> 2043.08
the air and

2047.12 --> 2052.6389999999997
and we were all kind of still

2050.399 --> 2055.04
a lot of us had like the idea like we

2052.639 --> 2056.079
are going to be like a new collective

2055.04 --> 2058.879
almost

2056.079 --> 2061.119
so everybody was just

2058.879 --> 2062.48
peeking and trying to make predictions

2061.119 --> 2065.04
and

2062.48 --> 2065.04
sometimes

2066.079 --> 2070.8790000000004
now almost trying to form a new

2068.079 --> 2072.8
narrative layer over on the flat earth

2070.879 --> 2075.2799999999997
narrative layer that was kind of like

2072.8 --> 2076.7200000000003
the mindset back then

2075.28 --> 2078.32
and now that is

2076.72 --> 2080.6389999999997
after that

2078.32 --> 2083.28
it kind of crashed

2080.639 --> 2085.359
when the infighting war started because

2083.28 --> 2087.9190000000003
that was actually

2085.359 --> 2090.48
really heavy and fractured the whole

2087.919 --> 2090.48
community

2091.04 --> 2095.599
and now there's separate groups kind of

2093.679 --> 2098.32
operating separately

2095.599 --> 2100.56
still recovering from all that

2098.32 --> 2102.96
with impulses of

2100.56 --> 2105.92
paranoia and

2102.96 --> 2107.76
an envy and that's problematic

2105.92 --> 2110.2400000000002
savonia syndrome

2107.76 --> 2112.48
right so first there was a massive wave

2110.24 --> 2115.1189999999997
of energy everybody really almost got

2112.48 --> 2117.68
drunk on it and so like high of the

2115.119 --> 2122.4
energy like almost like

2117.68 --> 2125.7599999999998
drugs high off just the energy of it

2122.4 --> 2128.7200000000003
through the people through the awakening

2125.76 --> 2128.7200000000003
i got high of it

2129.599 --> 2133.839
where like you're like watching videos

2132.16 --> 2135.839
watching videos watching videos and you

2133.839 --> 2138.48
can't step away and like oh [ __ ] i'm

2135.839 --> 2140.16
getting dehydrated that level of energy

2138.48 --> 2141.92
and enthusiasm

2140.16 --> 2144.0
and that was

2141.92 --> 2147.0
what it was like

2144.0 --> 2147.0
2015.

2150.64 --> 2155.44
but eventually the energy kind of got

2153.2 --> 2157.7599999999998
tapped out and then

2155.44 --> 2158.88
people kind of just started to poke

2157.76 --> 2162.2400000000002
others

2158.88 --> 2162.2400000000002
other flat earthers and then

2163.52 --> 2169.119
don't exactly know how it started but i

2165.599 --> 2171.28
think like eric dube probably started it

2169.119 --> 2172.6400000000003
in my memory he was like the first one

2171.28 --> 2175.76
to just start

2172.64 --> 2179.52
attacking and calling other shills

2175.76 --> 2179.5200000000004
doing videos about chills

2179.92 --> 2183.52
and then

2181.2 --> 2185.4399999999996
eventually infighting started and

2183.52 --> 2187.839
multiple people were starting to do

2185.44 --> 2189.76
things about psychopaths and all that

2187.839 --> 2191.04
talking about controllers but then

2189.76 --> 2194.079
started to

2191.04 --> 2196.4
suspect other flat earthers of being

2194.079 --> 2199.3590000000004
infiltrators it's a serious paranoia

2196.4 --> 2201.119
going on serious

2199.359 --> 2204.72
in fighting wars

2201.119 --> 2209.32
but this rob skiba video was before that

2204.72 --> 2209.3199999999997
when the energy was still very high

2225.92 --> 2232.56
so they were stolen wow those banners

2228.96 --> 2232.56
that's that's just weird

2233.28 --> 2236.4
like who would do that

2240.96 --> 2246.0
maybe you got people in your vicinity

2243.76 --> 2248.0
that really

2246.0 --> 2250.24
really hate flat earth

2248.0 --> 2253.28
that hate it so much they'll never even

2250.24 --> 2254.3999999999996
talk about it they just want to destroy

2253.28 --> 2258.079
anything

2254.4 --> 2258.079
that reminds them about it

2259.44 --> 2261.76
right

2264.72 --> 2268.5989999999997
i've met some of those

2279.76 --> 2285.8390000000004
are you seeking sky water

2282.72 --> 2285.839
good to see you

2306.079 --> 2313.28
what are you talking about

2308.48 --> 2317.4
at dame's remote viewing incident

2313.28 --> 2317.4
are you getting that from

2342.64 --> 2347.5989999999997
yes classical homeopath

2345.119 --> 2350.079
well i think we're all suspicious

2347.599 --> 2355.079
it's just that we're just going by his

2350.079 --> 2355.079
actions and he's he's a great guy

2375.44 --> 2377.76
what

2380.56 --> 2383.839
really you do

2385.359 --> 2389.119
those types of prayers wow

2390.72 --> 2396.24
don't think that uh

2393.119 --> 2398.7200000000003
christ would appreciate that

2396.24 --> 2400.8799999999997
just will soaring you don't pray for

2398.72 --> 2402.7999999999997
somebody to be haunted in their dreams

2400.88 --> 2407.079
every night

2402.8 --> 2407.079
that's not a prayer that's a curse

2462.24 --> 2466.4799999999996
okay so you can start i still have

2463.92 --> 2468.2400000000002
absolutely no idea who you're talking

2466.48 --> 2470.4
about and

2468.24 --> 2471.4399999999996
also i have no idea why you brought that

2470.4 --> 2474.4
up

2471.44 --> 2474.4
out of nowhere but

2475.599 --> 2479.44
fine

2477.359 --> 2481.68
there's a mystery about somebody that

2479.44 --> 2483.28
remote viewed up to a certain point and

2481.68 --> 2485.52
then he called it the skill shot okay

2483.28 --> 2487.52
that's the info i got out of that i have

2485.52 --> 2491.16
still absolutely no idea what you're

2487.52 --> 2491.16
talking about though

2498.319 --> 2505.48
the paranoia i mentioned a few minutes

2500.96 --> 2505.48
ago is manifest oh really where

2514.319 --> 2517.7599999999998
oh you mean the comment from jabwell

2516.24 --> 2521.2
soaring you don't know who's an actor

2517.76 --> 2523.5200000000004
and who's not yeah yeah we do

2521.2 --> 2526.3999999999996
if you can look

2523.52 --> 2527.28
and actually figure out what who people

2526.4 --> 2528.96
are

2527.28 --> 2532.0
what they're doing yeah you can

2528.96 --> 2532.0
absolutely you can

2532.24 --> 2536.319
so

2534.0 --> 2539.2
yeah i disagree we can see who's an

2536.319 --> 2539.2
actor and who isn't

2540.079 --> 2543.76
it just takes a little effort

2542.88 --> 2546.2400000000002
right

2543.76 --> 2547.92
it's really sloth

2546.24 --> 2549.7599999999998
that stops you

2547.92 --> 2551.359
from knowing who's an actor and who

2549.76 --> 2554.1600000000003
isn't

2551.359 --> 2558.88
it's sloth it's laziness it's just you

2554.16 --> 2558.8799999999997
no i'm just gonna choose one or zero

2559.599 --> 2564.319
no more thought to it

2561.44 --> 2566.0
polarization

2564.319 --> 2567.7599999999998
stupid

2566.0 --> 2570.92
sign of weakness

2567.76 --> 2570.92
i agree

2584.56 --> 2588.72
oh you're gonna call me a fool caps

2590.96 --> 2594.7200000000003
what the hell are you talking about

2596.16 --> 2599.7999999999997
yeah you can

2620.9 --> 2624.05
[Music]

2632.16 --> 2637.359
right you know how you can do i need to

2635.2 --> 2640.3999999999996
spell it all out for you fisher from

2637.359 --> 2641.44
eden who's adamant that i'm a fool for

2640.4 --> 2643.92
saying

2641.44 --> 2646.2400000000002
that you can know who are the actors and

2643.92 --> 2649.119
who aren't

2646.24 --> 2651.2
well first off you have to start

2649.119 --> 2654.0
by stopping

2651.2 --> 2656.0
the oversimplified okay

2654.0 --> 2657.44
one or a zero i'm going to choose that

2656.0 --> 2659.44
one

2657.44 --> 2662.48
that's the first thing you got to stop

2659.44 --> 2663.839
you got to realize that you don't know

2662.48 --> 2666.8
your enemies

2663.839 --> 2668.64
from your friends if you're not informed

2666.8 --> 2670.7200000000003
you have to get to know them you have to

2668.64 --> 2673.7599999999998
see what they're doing you have to

2670.72 --> 2678.3999999999996
figure out their motivations

2673.76 --> 2681.5200000000004
what drives them how their ego is

2678.4 --> 2683.599
very important to know

2681.52 --> 2686.48
because then you can tell

2683.599 --> 2688.56
when are they acting why are they acting

2686.48 --> 2690.4
what are their objectives

2688.56 --> 2691.7599999999998
yeah you can

2690.4 --> 2694.96
know

2691.76 --> 2698.1600000000003
who is an actor and isn't by knowing the

2694.96 --> 2700.4
person based on the information they put

2698.16 --> 2704.0
out based on their code of conduct based

2700.4 --> 2705.92
on their presentation

2704.0 --> 2706.96
based on their writings

2705.92 --> 2708.079
based on

2706.96 --> 2711.04
everything

2708.079 --> 2715.3590000000004
you figure it out

2711.04 --> 2717.04
because an actor does things typically

2715.359 --> 2719.359
that their personal life will not

2717.04 --> 2721.04
reflect at all

2719.359 --> 2723.52
that's how you know it's an actor how

2721.04 --> 2724.8
it's a shill they're basically do

2723.52 --> 2726.079
performing

2724.8 --> 2729.04
for money

2726.079 --> 2730.2400000000002
usually it is money or power which is

2729.04 --> 2732.88
even worse

2730.24 --> 2735.2799999999997
and then the strain of it will reflect

2732.88 --> 2738.48
on their life if it's actually up in

2735.28 --> 2742.6400000000003
opposition to what they personally want

2738.48 --> 2742.64
so yeah you can

2743.28 --> 2747.0400000000004
and you're a fool

2745.44 --> 2748.96
if you don't

2747.04 --> 2752.68
if you think you don't

2748.96 --> 2752.68
if you think you can't

2763.599 --> 2768.56
and when you do actually do that

2766.64 --> 2771.359
start figuring it out you'll figure out

2768.56 --> 2773.68
that everybody has a bit of actor in

2771.359 --> 2775.839
them if they're active

2773.68 --> 2779.359
on media especially if they have shows

2775.839 --> 2780.56
like i am an actor i'm an actor pta you

2779.359 --> 2782.319
called it

2780.56 --> 2785.44
i'm an actor

2782.319 --> 2785.44
i'm a life actor

2785.76 --> 2791.0400000000004
acting is literally a part of my

2788.16 --> 2791.04
personality

2795.119 --> 2800.0
it's how i

2796.48 --> 2802.72
conduct myself it's how i communicate

2800.0 --> 2806.0
it's my little sprinkles

2802.72 --> 2809.2
but also my ways to get through

2806.0 --> 2812.96
by appealing to icons

2809.2 --> 2814.72
that i size up are in people's hearts

2812.96 --> 2817.839
and dreams

2814.72 --> 2817.839
that's acting

2819.92 --> 2824.079
right if you figure it out further

2822.079 --> 2826.6400000000003
further then eventually the border line

2824.079 --> 2829.2000000000003
between natural behavior and acting

2826.64 --> 2830.96
becomes much more vague

2829.2 --> 2832.319
you just have to

2830.96 --> 2834.4
derive

2832.319 --> 2837.359
the act

2834.4 --> 2837.359
from the person

2837.52 --> 2841.48
like you distill it

2848.079 --> 2851.28
what are you doing

2850.079 --> 2854.6400000000003
don't just

2851.28 --> 2858.44
say hello by posting a link galo apple i

2854.64 --> 2858.44
don't appreciate that

2870.4 --> 2874.4
what do i think of 24 7 discord have i

2872.559 --> 2876.4
been there yeah yeah i haven't been

2874.4 --> 2878.64
there in a while though

2876.4 --> 2881.28
i have been active like half a year ago

2878.64 --> 2883.1189999999997
i was there

2881.28 --> 2885.6800000000003
i would check it out regularly but it's

2883.119 --> 2887.2000000000003
like a blabber for everybody

2885.68 --> 2889.52
type of show

2887.2 --> 2889.52
room

2892.24 --> 2897.68
i haven't really bumped into anything

2894.72 --> 2899.7599999999998
revolutionary there

2897.68 --> 2902.5589999999997
in a while

2899.76 --> 2904.2400000000002
but it's still going i think and there's

2902.559 --> 2908.3190000000004
a lot of people that hang around there

2904.24 --> 2910.64
so it is really like a community room

2908.319 --> 2915.16
community building where everybody just

2910.64 --> 2915.16
pops by when they feel like it

2916.16 --> 2920.72
i'm a thespian what is that

2918.559 --> 2923.7200000000003
who are you talking to joseph

2920.72 --> 2923.72
369.

2929.2 --> 2933.2
you think rob was amazing and a

2931.68 --> 2934.319
gatekeeper

2933.2 --> 2936.48
really

2934.319 --> 2937.68
but you can't prove that's why would you

2936.48 --> 2940.079
think that

2937.68 --> 2943.3999999999996
if you can't prove it what made you

2940.079 --> 2943.4
think that

2948.64 --> 2955.1189999999997
i mean i think that a lot of people have

2951.68 --> 2957.359
more reason to suspect me from being

2955.119 --> 2958.6400000000003
amazing then rob skiba i might be wrong

2957.359 --> 2961.839
there but yeah

2958.64 --> 2964.0
i actually just blatantly used 33 i

2961.839 --> 2966.5589999999997
claimed it

2964.0 --> 2968.8
like this is mine i don't care what

2966.559 --> 2971.28
people thinks it means

2968.8 --> 2975.3590000000004
what it signifies there is something

2971.28 --> 2977.44
about it and i make it mine i claim it

2975.359 --> 2981.2
you could say

2977.44 --> 2982.319
maybe esoterically i pick up that ring

2981.2 --> 2985.4399999999996
right

2982.319 --> 2988.0
i don't know yet

2985.44 --> 2992.319
feel that i need to do that

2988.0 --> 2995.76
i felt that a long time ago even though

2992.319 --> 2998.88
i will not become a

2995.76 --> 3003.76
standard role in freemason

2998.88 --> 3003.76
i'm completely independent eclectic

3008.0 --> 3013.839
a thespian is a person who acts in the

3009.92 --> 3013.839
theater oh yeah

3018.96 --> 3021.2
right

3024.16 --> 3030.0789999999997
well william shatner is like a typical

3027.04 --> 3030.079
thespian isn't he

3032.319 --> 3040.04
i'm not on anybody's mason radar yeah i

3035.359 --> 3040.04
know because my actual actions

3040.16 --> 3045.92
basically prove that i can't because i

3042.48 --> 3048.2400000000002
don't play their censorship games

3045.92 --> 3049.599
they're self-censorship mechanisms i

3048.24 --> 3053.9599999999996
don't do that

3049.599 --> 3053.96
i only do it in things

3054.24 --> 3057.2
in other

3055.839 --> 3060.48
elements

3057.2 --> 3063.52
where i do not go i border off my

3060.48 --> 3065.359
frequency walls and say these are things

3063.52 --> 3067.2
that i'm not going to do ever even

3065.359 --> 3068.88
though i know it's out there even though

3067.2 --> 3070.5589999999997
i know there is probably need to deal

3068.88 --> 3072.8
with it

3070.559 --> 3074.8
this far and no further

3072.8 --> 3076.1600000000003
because i need

3074.8 --> 3078.2400000000002
the room

3076.16 --> 3081.3999999999996
i need the roo the breathing room for

3078.24 --> 3081.3999999999996
the spirit

3084.16 --> 3090.96
and that is not fairy mason

3087.92 --> 3092.96
unless you're like a non-public mason

3090.96 --> 3097.2400000000002
you're just one of the guys that doesn't

3092.96 --> 3097.2400000000002
like seeking out attention

3108.559 --> 3113.599
oh he caused a lot of division brought

3110.64 --> 3115.359
to say god's word insert right yeah what

3113.599 --> 3118.6400000000003
that's

3115.359 --> 3119.5989999999997
dude how does that make him amazing

3118.64 --> 3122.72
really

3119.599 --> 3125.76
do the masons are they like oh no you

3122.72 --> 3128.64
gotta say it in this specific way or

3125.76 --> 3130.559
you'll offend god or you'll

3128.64 --> 3132.24
something will go wrong

3130.559 --> 3134.079
really do masons do that i don't think

3132.24 --> 3136.0789999999997
that's typically mason

3134.079 --> 3139.119
i think masons dabble in all different

3136.079 --> 3141.6800000000003
types of issues more like oh everything

3139.119 --> 3142.559
is inside out right

3141.68 --> 3145.2799999999997
so

3142.559 --> 3147.44
i think that rob skiba

3145.28 --> 3150.88
was so precise on these words because

3147.44 --> 3153.359
that was his eclectic path

3150.88 --> 3155.92
that was how he figured out he should be

3153.359 --> 3158.24
doing he prayed a lot like in the in the

3155.92 --> 3159.92
wild

3158.24 --> 3163.04
and i mean

3159.92 --> 3165.6800000000003
not looking out specific people

3163.04 --> 3167.44
to ex for exclusive sources but he was

3165.68 --> 3168.96
trying to figure it out

3167.44 --> 3171.44
and he thought that it was very

3168.96 --> 3171.44
important

3172.8 --> 3176.48
that was his eclectic

3175.52 --> 3178.4
route

3176.48 --> 3181.599
i think he's wrong i think it is

3178.4 --> 3183.2000000000003
grounded in esoterics clearly to me

3181.599 --> 3184.0
it is

3183.2 --> 3186.48
but

3184.0 --> 3189.599
that doesn't mean that he is a mason

3186.48 --> 3189.599
because he did that

3189.68 --> 3195.72
i think he just genuinely thought he was

3192.0 --> 3195.72
doing the right thing

3202.16 --> 3206.7999999999997
see

3204.0 --> 3210.079
this is called this is what is called

3206.8 --> 3212.96
actually directly addressing things

3210.079 --> 3215.04
right not like oh he said the word

3212.96 --> 3218.559
one zero one zero

3215.04 --> 3220.72
oh i'm on this side you are evil

3218.559 --> 3222.4
hassle hassle distraction distraction

3220.72 --> 3223.1189999999997
move away from the tension

3222.4 --> 3225.76
no

3223.119 --> 3227.599
what i do is actually directly

3225.76 --> 3229.599
addressing things

3227.599 --> 3232.319
not one zero

3229.599 --> 3234.559
not that polarized thing

3232.319 --> 3238.8
it's ironic by the way because yeah 10

3234.559 --> 3241.599
star is 1-0 there is something about 1-0

3238.8 --> 3245.48
is just don't get polarized

3241.599 --> 3245.48
see it for what it is

3258.96 --> 3262.96
have you

3260.48 --> 3265.359
any useful hobby to share gardening

3262.96 --> 3266.48
ideas chef cooking making something

3265.359 --> 3271.359
useful

3266.48 --> 3271.359
do i have hobby ideas for sharing

3273.92 --> 3279.76
well not right now really

3277.04 --> 3281.52
i mean i do talk about cooking a little

3279.76 --> 3284.4
it's just not something that i

3281.52 --> 3284.4
constantly do

3290.72 --> 3296.24
and yeah gardening i love it i but all i

3293.68 --> 3298.0789999999997
got is a bunch of potted herb plants

3296.24 --> 3299.52
that's it

3298.079 --> 3302.799
and yeah

3299.52 --> 3304.799
i have i am a goldsmith i haven't done

3302.799 --> 3306.88
it in a while

3304.799 --> 3309.2
seven years

3306.88 --> 3311.839
but eight years

3309.2 --> 3314.5589999999997
is it seven or eight

3311.839 --> 3314.5589999999997
no eight

3315.68 --> 3320.24
but yeah not currently active in it so

3318.16 --> 3321.92
it's not really interest it's not super

3320.24 --> 3325.2
interesting to talk about i do talk

3321.92 --> 3327.359
about like metallurgy and the elem like

3325.2 --> 3327.359
the

3328.319 --> 3330.5589999999997
the

3332.839 --> 3338.799
chemistry of it

3335.359 --> 3342.16
metals i do evolve it in physics

3338.799 --> 3345.04
right so eventually

3342.16 --> 3346.839
my hobbies always kind of tend to divert

3345.04 --> 3348.48
to just knowledge and

3346.839 --> 3351.359
theoretics

3348.48 --> 3352.4
and of as many relevant things as

3351.359 --> 3354.0
possible

3352.4 --> 3355.599
it's all about learning all about

3354.0 --> 3359.359
building skill

3355.599 --> 3360.839
and in every useful direction as part of

3359.359 --> 3364.5589999999997
my

3360.839 --> 3366.96
mission and i feel like i i kind of

3364.559 --> 3368.88
took that mission in a way

3366.96 --> 3372.7200000000003
in my own eclectic way from owen

3368.88 --> 3376.559
benjamin who is really championing that

3372.72 --> 3378.319
much more on point to be fair right i'm

3376.559 --> 3380.0
still kind of a wizard in relation to

3378.319 --> 3380.96
him or i say i'm a wizard but i'm like

3380.0 --> 3383.76
yeah

3380.96 --> 3387.44
he's doing the full thing

3383.76 --> 3387.44
and he's doing it very eloquently

3388.799 --> 3396.16
and at that is an example but i do that

3392.64 --> 3396.16
i uphold that principle

3396.799 --> 3403.04
it's a way of doing things

3399.76 --> 3408.1600000000003
to always build skill expand make people

3403.04 --> 3412.24
consider make people help the wisdom

3408.16 --> 3415.24
help people grow wiser help people grow

3412.24 --> 3415.24
wiser

3419.52 --> 3422.72
respect everyone

3421.599 --> 3424.7200000000003
no

3422.72 --> 3427.2799999999997
no

3424.72 --> 3429.68
excuse me

3427.28 --> 3433.52
no absolutely not

3429.68 --> 3434.799
respect those that actually act

3433.52 --> 3438.319
respectful

3434.799 --> 3440.72
i'm not gonna respect some troll scumbag

3438.319 --> 3442.319
that's gonna pop in anonymously just to

3440.72 --> 3444.64
try to backstab

3442.319 --> 3446.4
no why would i respect that no you you

3444.64 --> 3449.04
need to earn respect

3446.4 --> 3453.319
through your behavior through following

3449.04 --> 3453.319
the proper code of conduct

3461.28 --> 3465.76
oh oh look

3463.04 --> 3467.359
laughing is talking about the devil

3465.76 --> 3469.92
there's one here right now don't delete

3467.359 --> 3471.839
him because it's so funny

3469.92 --> 3473.6800000000003
they think

3471.839 --> 3476.48
this is the funny thing about gammas

3473.68 --> 3478.8799999999997
right to me at this point gammas aren't

3476.48 --> 3483.04
even annoying anymore they are just

3478.88 --> 3485.76
entertaining because they don't realize

3483.04 --> 3488.96
like they can't even get a grip on their

3485.76 --> 3491.3590000000004
own wisdom that they share so they share

3488.96 --> 3494.48
insights

3491.359 --> 3495.52
that they don't understand and that is

3494.48 --> 3498.2400000000002
kind of the

3495.52 --> 3500.079
magic about some of these gammas

3498.24 --> 3502.5589999999997
like laughing at science and theirs

3500.079 --> 3504.559
crazy with how is the psychosis oh yeah

3502.559 --> 3506.6400000000003
that's doing i'm doing fine

3504.559 --> 3509.76
i've got my multiple personalities

3506.64 --> 3511.5989999999997
perfectly under control for years now

3509.76 --> 3514.3190000000004
perfectly

3511.599 --> 3515.28
still believe in literal demons

3514.319 --> 3516.4
well

3515.28 --> 3518.7200000000003
yeah

3516.4 --> 3522.48
yeah the spirit

3518.72 --> 3524.319
the spirit of demons yes absolutely

3522.48 --> 3526.88
sends their vibrations over the internet

3524.319 --> 3529.52
you betcha

3526.88 --> 3529.52
yes i can

3529.68 --> 3536.24
you can even sense it through a very a

3532.16 --> 3536.24
photograph of somebody

3536.319 --> 3539.119
yeah i can

3540.799 --> 3545.4
i find my cults oh

3547.599 --> 3553.319
share your pain

3550.16 --> 3553.319
it's hilarious

3560.48 --> 3565.2
okay martian

3563.04 --> 3567.839
34

3565.2 --> 3569.9199999999996
yeah of course you have to always

3567.839 --> 3571.839
arrange your garden to have the best

3569.92 --> 3573.6800000000003
light you got to know where you're gonna

3571.839 --> 3574.5589999999997
garden of course

3573.68 --> 3577.5589999999997
it's

3574.559 --> 3577.559
automatic

3588.24 --> 3593.04
sensed my vibrations in ado

3595.76 --> 3601.8390000000004
that wasn't even you oh

3598.799 --> 3601.839
it's sean hawkins

3604.64 --> 3610.0
because only sean hawkins actually

3607.52 --> 3612.48
doesn't know how to keep anonymous while

3610.0 --> 3615.119
he's using a sock troll

3612.48 --> 3616.64
so he follows the anonymous blueprint

3615.119 --> 3619.04
from other

3616.64 --> 3621.44
[ __ ] out there on the internet

3619.04 --> 3624.5589999999997
but then he kind of forgets

3621.44 --> 3628.0
and then he just reveals himself

3624.559 --> 3631.76
by literally talking about himself as an

3628.0 --> 3634.079
individual that is sean hawkins

3631.76 --> 3636.1600000000003
see that's called reading that's

3634.079 --> 3640.319
figuring it out i figured it out this

3636.16 --> 3640.319
guy you see here in chat that is shawn

3640.839 --> 3646.96
hawkins notice how he's not denying it

3644.079 --> 3646.96
because i'm right

3648.319 --> 3651.359
isn't that hilarious

3653.76 --> 3657.6400000000003
there are not sean hawkins

3660.319 --> 3665.2
okay well that doesn't really exclude

3662.16 --> 3665.2
one from another but

3666.96 --> 3671.599
okay i might be wrong then

3668.96 --> 3674.559
i don't know sean hawkins would probably

3671.599 --> 3677.04
just say it was him

3674.559 --> 3679.119
a guy told to kill himself right well

3677.04 --> 3681.2
yeah you should have

3679.119 --> 3682.1600000000003
it would save the world a whole bunch of

3681.2 --> 3683.68
pain

3682.16 --> 3685.5989999999997
and yourself

3683.68 --> 3686.799
right there's nowhere else to go for you

3685.599 --> 3688.7200000000003
anyway

3686.799 --> 3690.799
when you're dip this

3688.72 --> 3693.7599999999998
down into the [ __ ]

3690.799 --> 3696.4
there's no more rewards left for you to

3693.76 --> 3696.4
crawl out

3696.72 --> 3702.16
you see when you get this bad

3699.76 --> 3704.079
there's no rewards left

3702.16 --> 3707.92
for when you would actually attempt to

3704.079 --> 3710.48
crawl out because you burn everything

3707.92 --> 3713.04
right everybody hates you now

3710.48 --> 3714.96
they really do and you know it

3713.04 --> 3716.88
that's why you try not to think about it

3714.96 --> 3718.0
anymore it's part of the paradigm of

3716.88 --> 3723.079
being

3718.0 --> 3723.079
a bottom [ __ ] gamma like you are

3738.079 --> 3742.079
meanwhile i have a life well we wouldn't

3740.72 --> 3744.64
know

3742.079 --> 3748.1600000000003
because you keep hiding behind socks

3744.64 --> 3748.16
trying to harass people

3749.52 --> 3754.96
so i don't think you have a life people

3752.48 --> 3757.68
like you that are this nasty they don't

3754.96 --> 3759.76
have a life they're very eloquent in

3757.68 --> 3761.1189999999997
just pretending quickly on their own

3759.76 --> 3763.3590000000004
they're just saying it because like oh

3761.119 --> 3765.119
who's going to disprove it right who's

3763.359 --> 3766.48
going to disprove i can just lie like

3765.119 --> 3769.6800000000003
that

3766.48 --> 3772.079
i have a life right

3769.68 --> 3774.319
so easy to bluff on the internet when

3772.079 --> 3776.88
you're anonymous you're anonymous little

3774.319 --> 3779.52
gamma [ __ ] bottom [ __ ]

3776.88 --> 3782.48
like you it's very easy

3779.52 --> 3784.559
to just say you have a life because

3782.48 --> 3788.0
who's gonna disprove it well i can

3784.559 --> 3788.0
disprove it you know how

3788.079 --> 3794.48
by pointing at how you're acting and

3791.039 --> 3797.119
then weighing off the likelihood of you

3794.48 --> 3800.96
actually having that life that you

3797.119 --> 3804.079
pretend you have in the argument yeah

3800.96 --> 3804.079
it's not that difficult

3806.0 --> 3810.76
come on

3807.52 --> 3810.7599999999998
yeah yeah

3816.559 --> 3820.3190000000004
wait you just said he could be wrong

3818.079 --> 3824.319
that he's a sean sock

3820.319 --> 3826.88
no he probably isn't sean

3824.319 --> 3827.92
like sean is not the od

3826.88 --> 3829.599
sick

3827.92 --> 3834.119
depraved

3829.599 --> 3834.119
moronic bastard on the internet

3840.72 --> 3843.4399999999996
wrath of me

3849.599 --> 3854.319
maybe we should not incite people to

3852.079 --> 3856.319
commit suicide i know two teenagers that

3854.319 --> 3859.839
commit suicide after people told them

3856.319 --> 3861.2
they were useless well

3859.839 --> 3864.16
you know

3861.2 --> 3867.359
if you were a teenager and you act like

3864.16 --> 3869.92
a complete gamma [ __ ] useless just

3867.359 --> 3872.64
pretending i'm okay and not actually

3869.92 --> 3873.92
just admitting like a man

3872.64 --> 3876.48
or a woman

3873.92 --> 3878.799
that you have issues and then

3876.48 --> 3882.48
try to be responsible

3878.799 --> 3885.28
try to accept your weakened position in

3882.48 --> 3887.119
order to face it and overcome it but no

3885.28 --> 3889.039
no you're just gonna deflect everything

3887.119 --> 3892.079
and be a complete sick

3889.039 --> 3894.48
bastard anonymously

3892.079 --> 3896.1600000000003
well then you deserve

3894.48 --> 3898.88
what you do

3896.16 --> 3898.8799999999997
you understand

3901.44 --> 3906.319
it's very specific though i would never

3903.52 --> 3909.52
like somebody that's actually like

3906.319 --> 3912.24
like oh man i feel really [ __ ]

3909.52 --> 3914.559
i'm just in a bad place in my life dude

3912.24 --> 3917.4399999999996
just can you please not

3914.559 --> 3919.44
press me too much dude i would help them

3917.44 --> 3923.839
i would absolutely help them because

3919.44 --> 3923.839
they're at least being honest

3925.359 --> 3930.319
if you're can't if you can't even be

3928.0 --> 3932.88
honest

3930.319 --> 3935.2
about how bad

3932.88 --> 3936.96
you got it

3935.2 --> 3939.2799999999997
then you deserve everything that comes

3936.96 --> 3939.28
to you

3942.64 --> 3948.0
right because

3944.16 --> 3950.24
dishonesty about it is

3948.0 --> 3953.039
quite the opposite counter opposite to

3950.24 --> 3953.0389999999998
repentance

3955.359 --> 3959.5989999999997
if you don't do that

3957.2 --> 3961.9199999999996
then you deserve everything that comes

3959.599 --> 3961.92
to you

3962.4 --> 3967.039
right

3963.359 --> 3970.88
just being all soft oh poor boy has no

3967.039 --> 3974.2400000000002
control over himself oh just let him

3970.88 --> 3976.079
let him barf it out constantly non-stop

3974.24 --> 3977.52
never ending

3976.079 --> 3978.96
yet no

3977.52 --> 3981.68
no

3978.96 --> 3981.68
i don't do that

3982.079 --> 3987.799
i'm not gonna pamper to gamma

3984.799 --> 3987.799
freaks

4000.319 --> 4007.48
okay you were out of here

4003.68 --> 4007.48
straw manning scumbag

4009.359 --> 4012.0789999999997
you're outta here

4015.839 --> 4018.88
people suffer from depression yeah i

4017.92 --> 4020.64
know

4018.88 --> 4022.799
so have i

4020.64 --> 4025.1189999999997
you know what i didn't do

4022.799 --> 4029.0389999999998
when i was like that

4025.119 --> 4031.52
neck people other people make them feel

4029.039 --> 4033.3590000000004
miserable try to make them feel bad

4031.52 --> 4034.4
about themselves

4033.359 --> 4036.96
just so

4034.4 --> 4038.559
i could feel better than them yeah

4036.96 --> 4042.0
that's what i don't do

4038.559 --> 4044.0
and have absolutely no mercy for people

4042.0 --> 4045.92
that do that no

4044.0 --> 4049.2
mercy

4045.92 --> 4051.76
if you are a gamma [ __ ]

4049.2 --> 4054.3999999999996
that just because you feel bad

4051.76 --> 4056.48
you're gonna make other people's life

4054.4 --> 4058.799
miserable hell

4056.48 --> 4060.48
you deserve everything i guess that you

4058.799 --> 4061.359
get everything

4060.48 --> 4062.799
no

4061.359 --> 4064.16
mercy

4062.799 --> 4066.319
you hear me

4064.16 --> 4069.2799999999997
now if you suffer from depression

4066.319 --> 4070.5589999999997
that's that's annoying that's painful

4069.28 --> 4072.559
right

4070.559 --> 4073.76
what's the first thing you learn not to

4072.559 --> 4077.28
do

4073.76 --> 4080.0
when you got get like that don't try to

4077.28 --> 4082.799
deny it walk away from it and make other

4080.0 --> 4085.68
people into a living hell yeah it's the

4082.799 --> 4088.559
first thing you don't do

4085.68 --> 4090.48
so if you then proceed to do that then

4088.559 --> 4094.2400000000002
you deserve everything

4090.48 --> 4094.2400000000002
you get you hear me

4097.92 --> 4102.08
oh get the [ __ ] out of here scumbag

4100.799 --> 4104.4
yeah

4102.08 --> 4109.96
do it do it [ __ ]

4104.4 --> 4109.96
do it do what i said you should do do it

4117.62 --> 4120.67
[Music]

4132.88 --> 4136.08
yeah

4133.679 --> 4138.2390000000005
might have taken notes i hate bullies i

4136.08 --> 4140.96
hate them savagely

4138.239 --> 4144.639999999999
and i will not

4140.96 --> 4144.64
i will not relent

4145.52 --> 4150.64
i will not

4148.08 --> 4154.719
this is essential if you don't get that

4150.64 --> 4159.6
out the world will go to hell because

4154.719 --> 4159.6
these scumbags drag everybody with them

4159.679 --> 4162.08
they do

4163.359 --> 4168.2390000000005
they literally want the entire world to

4166.319 --> 4171.04
be miserable

4168.239 --> 4173.12
rather than to confront where they're at

4171.04 --> 4175.5199999999995
and try to do something about it because

4173.12 --> 4178.159
they're scumbags they are demons and

4175.52 --> 4183.120000000001
they disease they deserve

4178.159 --> 4183.12
to be remedied like a disease

4184.56 --> 4189.2390000000005
or surgically removed

4191.12 --> 4197.679
if you will

4193.679 --> 4197.679
operate it out of the way

4197.76 --> 4204.2390000000005
to allow the organism that is

4200.84 --> 4206.719
humanity to recover

4204.239 --> 4210.12
from the pestilence

4206.719 --> 4210.12
that is you

4218.96 --> 4223.28
those kids were bullied yeah moonshadow

4221.04 --> 4226.8
yeah that's fine so was i

4223.28 --> 4231.0
guess what i'm doing right now

4226.8 --> 4231.0
not being them

4231.28 --> 4239.199
yeah because i hate bullies i hate them

4236.8 --> 4240.320000000001
where things start to happen visually in

4239.199 --> 4244.599999999999
my mind

4240.32 --> 4244.599999999999
that i wouldn't share with anybody

4244.8 --> 4249.12
i hate them

4246.56 --> 4250.96
i have no mercy

4249.12 --> 4253.679
no mercy

4250.96 --> 4256.4800000000005
opportunity opportunity to step away

4253.679 --> 4257.679
opportunity to grow realization and

4256.48 --> 4259.12
wisdom

4257.679 --> 4260.4
that you're doing the wrong thing and

4259.12 --> 4262.719
even help

4260.4 --> 4264.96
when somebody repents

4262.719 --> 4266.2390000000005
i will not

4264.96 --> 4267.84
relent

4266.239 --> 4270.839999999999
you hear me

4267.84 --> 4270.84
never

4277.6 --> 4281.04
that's right if you're depressed

4279.199 --> 4283.759999999999
volunteer somebody help

4281.04 --> 4288.8
right do something that just feels good

4283.76 --> 4288.8
my personal advice if you're depressed

4289.04 --> 4291.92
take care of plants

4292.08 --> 4294.88
like

4293.12 --> 4296.32
take care of your garden right if you

4294.88 --> 4299.679
have a garden there should be plenty of

4296.32 --> 4302.4
work even in in this time of

4299.679 --> 4302.4
and if you don't

4302.56 --> 4306.320000000001
do like a bonsai tree

4304.8 --> 4311.719
right

4306.32 --> 4311.719
feel something alive on your hands

4314.48 --> 4320.639999999999
but whatever you do

4316.64 --> 4322.4800000000005
don't focus on that gaping black hole

4320.64 --> 4326.400000000001
in your heart

4322.48 --> 4329.919999999999
let it heal you let it heal by not

4326.4 --> 4331.5199999999995
bringing your attention directly to that

4329.92 --> 4333.84
although yeah stare

4331.52 --> 4337.120000000001
doing that for a while may help

4333.84 --> 4339.12
just so you know it's there again

4337.12 --> 4341.599999999999
because you can't forget and then it

4339.12 --> 4344.4
kind of stabs you in the back

4341.6 --> 4347.1990000000005
in an unexpected moment

4344.4 --> 4349.679
but you gotta keep busy

4347.199 --> 4353.759999999999
and one of the ways you don't keep busy

4349.679 --> 4357.76
is by acting like a [ __ ] monster

4353.76 --> 4361.1990000000005
and trying to make people miserable

4357.76 --> 4365.52
that's the one thing you don't do

4361.199 --> 4365.5199999999995
because it actually makes it worse

4366.159 --> 4368.799999999999
right

4367.44 --> 4371.12
it's like

4368.8 --> 4372.96
like a

4371.12 --> 4375.44
hard drug addiction

4372.96 --> 4378.08
very tough because when you get going

4375.44 --> 4379.919999999999
yeah you oh if you do actually in the

4378.08 --> 4381.36
moment feel a little bit better but

4379.92 --> 4382.96
while you do it

4381.36 --> 4385.199
the black hole

4382.96 --> 4386.719
inside you grow slightly bigger and

4385.199 --> 4389.678999999999
slightly bigger

4386.719 --> 4391.44
right that's why i said at the beginning

4389.679 --> 4393.92
when i addressed the troll here in my

4391.44 --> 4396.5599999999995
chat i said

4393.92 --> 4398.8
you've fallen too far i can feel it by

4396.56 --> 4400.88
the way you talk there's no more

4398.8 --> 4404.56
obstruction there's you don't you didn't

4400.88 --> 4406.8
build a wall to keep

4404.56 --> 4407.6
yourself from going too far and that

4406.8 --> 4410.2390000000005
means

4407.6 --> 4414.0
you have gone too far and that means

4410.239 --> 4417.28
that if you might walk out of it again

4414.0 --> 4419.76
guess what all that bloom it's gone

4417.28 --> 4422.239
because you went too far

4419.76 --> 4423.1990000000005
there's no recovering from that

4422.239 --> 4425.839999999999
or

4423.199 --> 4428.879999999999
there might be but then you'll have to

4425.84 --> 4431.28
face it even harder might break your

4428.88 --> 4431.28
mind

4431.44 --> 4436.96
right i can't perfectly exclude

4434.64 --> 4439.360000000001
that you can recover from that in a way

4436.96 --> 4442.4800000000005
i recovered from it i went too far i

4439.36 --> 4444.96
just when i was i had depression issues

4442.48 --> 4447.839999999999
i did go too far but i would always

4444.96 --> 4449.92
quickly realize it

4447.84 --> 4452.159000000001
and then stop immediately like

4449.92 --> 4454.719
immediately feel this is wrong i need to

4452.159 --> 4457.12
stop that immediately

4454.719 --> 4459.04
and i did have the dark impulses also to

4457.12 --> 4461.04
make other people miserable for no

4459.04 --> 4463.199
reason for no

4461.04 --> 4464.719
reason terrible

4463.199 --> 4467.12
terrible

4464.719 --> 4467.12
evil

4467.52 --> 4472.719
shadow over me

4469.6 --> 4476.320000000001
and yeah oh i'm a goth so i'm supposed

4472.719 --> 4476.32
to do that oh trendy

4477.36 --> 4481.04
still hurts it still hurts

4479.92 --> 4484.0
the

4481.04 --> 4485.6
damage is still there

4484.0 --> 4488.88
but i'm a tree

4485.6 --> 4490.320000000001
and i'm growing with it growing past it

4488.88 --> 4492.64
adapting

4490.32 --> 4494.5599999999995
and learning from it right if you're

4492.64 --> 4497.1990000000005
gonna get a scar

4494.56 --> 4499.84
then you better damn well try to learn

4497.199 --> 4503.199
everything you can from that

4499.84 --> 4505.360000000001
otherwise it's just gonna be a scar

4503.199 --> 4507.5199999999995
but it could also be a reminder of a

4505.36 --> 4511.839999999999
great learning experience that you could

4507.52 --> 4511.84
potentially even pass on to others

4514.48 --> 4519.36
right

4516.159 --> 4521.679
hello tony whitcomb breed up mate yeah

4519.36 --> 4521.679
whoa

4522.08 --> 4526.159
any arwynian units

4524.56 --> 4528.88
close by yet

4526.159 --> 4531.36
i don't see any rainbows

4528.88 --> 4535.36
right and our winning units are not

4531.36 --> 4539.719
anywhere you are winning units are a

4535.36 --> 4539.719
measure of apparent distances

4545.76 --> 4550.679
was that

4547.679 --> 4550.679
it

4574.08 --> 4579.32
life is full of choices yes it is george

4576.32 --> 4579.32
sanford

4581.679 --> 4585.52
right and that's very wise gaining

4584.08 --> 4587.04
wisdom yes

4585.52 --> 4589.360000000001
when i look

4587.04 --> 4591.44
when i was in grief right that's not

4589.36 --> 4592.88
even depression depression is when you

4591.44 --> 4594.799999999999
don't deal with it

4592.88 --> 4597.76
and then it can turn into depression

4594.8 --> 4600.96
right but when i was in grief over

4597.76 --> 4600.96
breaking up with my ex

4602.0 --> 4606.4
helping others

4604.159 --> 4609.4
was like the only

4606.4 --> 4609.4
remedy

4611.44 --> 4616.48
and even that sensation was part of the

4614.48 --> 4618.5599999999995
thing that also

4616.48 --> 4621.759999999999
really pulled me into becoming a live

4618.56 --> 4623.6
streamer oh pvp that's what you said all

4621.76 --> 4625.04
right all right tony which come out

4628.239 --> 4631.48
little speech

oh

4643.92 --> 4648.0

also paypal donation

4657.04 --> 4663.239
from slova moonbuggy awesome dude thank

4659.92 --> 4663.2390000000005
you so much

4665.36 --> 4668.96
and thank you tony whitcomb

4672.08 --> 4677.88
yeah

4673.44 --> 4677.879999999999
it's certainly going at least

4678.4 --> 4681.28
i'm

4679.28 --> 4685.28
pulling through like this

4681.28 --> 4688.159
fought suicide for 40 years whoa

4685.28 --> 4692.0
i've never fought suicide

4688.159 --> 4693.759999999999
like i disabled that option mechanically

4692.0 --> 4695.92
like with my mind

4693.76 --> 4698.320000000001
like a decision like

4695.92 --> 4700.96
i will literally

4698.32 --> 4702.799999999999
sit through torture

4700.96 --> 4705.679
actual torture because i know a

4702.8 --> 4707.76
mechanism how to turn it all off

4705.679 --> 4709.92
before i ever even

4707.76 --> 4712.0
consider ending it it's like no i'm

4709.92 --> 4714.96
never gonna end it

4712.0 --> 4715.76
no matter how torturous i feel

4714.96 --> 4717.84
like

4715.76 --> 4721.8
instead i just go hallucinating when

4717.84 --> 4721.8
that happens and i have

4721.84 --> 4727.360000000001
and that is a horrific experience by the

4724.719 --> 4730.32
way a pain hallucination

4727.36 --> 4730.32
an actual one

4730.4 --> 4735.04
that's

4732.32 --> 4737.12
well let's just say the moment you

4735.04 --> 4740.159
realize what's going on when you're in

4737.12 --> 4742.64
that and you snap out of it

4740.159 --> 4745.759999999999
every time that happens i give the most

4742.64 --> 4749.56
torturous screams you've ever heard

4745.76 --> 4749.56
because it's so painful

4749.92 --> 4754.159
like the pain floats and then suddenly

4752.239 --> 4757.919999999999
is

4754.159 --> 4757.92
right to the core oh my god

4759.199 --> 4763.5599999999995
just thinking about it give me shivers

4773.28 --> 4779.199
came to flatters and that healed and it

4776.48 --> 4781.919999999999
ends that is great that's great to hear

4779.199 --> 4786.0
well for me flat earth was also an

4781.92 --> 4786.0
important thing because i was getting

4786.239 --> 4790.239
demoralized by the world

4788.48 --> 4792.48
a lot

4790.239 --> 4792.48
like

4792.64 --> 4797.84
like i didn't feel like there was any

4795.36 --> 4800.0
saving of any of it

4797.84 --> 4801.84
it was all gonna go to hell i felt like

4800.0 --> 4803.44
that at times and then it would just try

4801.84 --> 4804.96
to forget about it and just oh let's see

4803.44 --> 4808.5599999999995
what comes up and

4804.96 --> 4810.8
try to stay positive but yeah

4808.56 --> 4814.080000000001
having gone into flat earth

4810.8 --> 4815.04
that changed and i realized wait

4814.08 --> 4817.84
there

4815.04 --> 4820.239
the situation that made me feel like

4817.84 --> 4822.2390000000005
that is not normal

4820.239 --> 4825.36
that's something that's being done to

4822.239 --> 4827.5199999999995
this world by people

4825.36 --> 4829.759999999999
as a control mechanism

4827.52 --> 4831.6
that's and that really changed

4829.76 --> 4834.08
everything that's also why it is

4831.6 --> 4836.719
absolutely impossible for me to actually

4834.08 --> 4839.04
go back like i couldn't do that i can

4836.719 --> 4843.12
act like that

4839.04 --> 4847.12
but i would end up in the same issue

4843.12 --> 4849.92
feeling like everything is going to hell

4847.12 --> 4853.36
if i do that like i could probably trick

4849.92 --> 4855.1990000000005
myself and even make myself forget

4853.36 --> 4857.28
but i wouldn't want to i've built too

4855.199 --> 4860.719
much upon the flat earth knowledge now

4857.28 --> 4864.84
too much to to just

4860.719 --> 4864.84
make it click off again

4878.8 --> 4882.88
well at different degrees of down with

4881.36 --> 4885.88
the sickness

4882.88 --> 4885.88
yes

4889.44 --> 4894.0
well that's why it's important to learn

4891.84 --> 4895.84
like what is really going on and how do

4894.0 --> 4897.84
you do it and what are the typical

4895.84 --> 4899.04
things you need to avoid

4897.84 --> 4901.52
and i

4899.04 --> 4903.36
well pride myself proud i'm proud that

4901.52 --> 4906.56
i'm able to

4903.36 --> 4908.719
roll it out pretty cohesively

4906.56 --> 4911.280000000001
and despite all the gammas doing what

4908.719 --> 4912.88
they do like that doesn't change it that

4911.28 --> 4915.92
doesn't change the

4912.88 --> 4919.36
cohesion and integrity of the

4915.92 --> 4923.8
information i have to present

4919.36 --> 4923.799999999999
in accordance to that subject

4932.56 --> 4936.56
what

4934.0 --> 4939.44
i watched the wits at this last stream i

4936.56 --> 4941.84
think everybody's name was rey

4939.44 --> 4944.879999999999
gamma ray what

4941.84 --> 4946.400000000001
i have no idea what is that a joke

4944.88 --> 4949.719
because otherwise i don't understand

4946.4 --> 4949.719
what you're saying

4958.96 --> 4964.56
oh man

4960.88 --> 4964.56
i've been going for a while now

4966.239 --> 4970.599999999999
that's been a good stream so far

4977.84 --> 4983.12
all right so yeah

4979.84 --> 4986.32
depression issues right especially

4983.12 --> 4988.96
during the end of summer when the autumn

4986.32 --> 4991.84
gets in a whole bunch of people do get

4988.96 --> 4994.8
like ooh they get annoying ideas again

4991.84 --> 4995.76
or feel down or miss the summer

4994.8 --> 4998.08
right

4995.76 --> 5001.08
whatever you do don't start nagging

4998.08 --> 5001.08
people

5001.76 --> 5007.76
and don't even want the summer feeling

5005.199 --> 5010.5599999999995
back right you had the summer feeling

5007.76 --> 5012.320000000001
now let's deal with how it is right now

5010.56 --> 5015.6
you got to recrystallize you got to

5012.32 --> 5018.08
re-figure out your your configuration

5015.6 --> 5020.96
how your energy works what you can do

5018.08 --> 5023.12
and then just do it start working with

5020.96 --> 5023.12
it

5025.36 --> 5030.159
right

5027.679 --> 5032.08
i found out that

5030.159 --> 5035.599999999999
in the autumn times

5032.08 --> 5038.8
when you typically do get a little down

5035.6 --> 5042.56
at the same time there is like this

5038.8 --> 5044.4800000000005
restless work energy that you can tame

5042.56 --> 5046.0
that you actually can do a whole bunch

5044.48 --> 5048.32
of work

5046.0 --> 5050.32
during that time and it probably

5048.32 --> 5052.239
interesting also to realize that it's

5050.32 --> 5053.599999999999
needed like especially if you would live

5052.239 --> 5055.04
in nature

5053.6 --> 5056.56
during the autumn there's a lot of work

5055.04 --> 5059.04
to do

5056.56 --> 5060.88
right a whole bunch of fruits

5059.04 --> 5063.36
and nuts

5060.88 --> 5066.08
that suddenly start dropping and there's

5063.36 --> 5067.759999999999
a whole bunch of things to do during

5066.08 --> 5069.5199999999995
autumn

5067.76 --> 5071.84
so

5069.52 --> 5074.0
i think there is like correlating work

5071.84 --> 5075.84
energy that is also released but you

5074.0 --> 5078.4
gotta tap into it and in order to do

5075.84 --> 5080.88
that you gotta step away from the

5078.4 --> 5082.5599999999995
missing the summer down

5080.88 --> 5083.6
feeling

5082.56 --> 5087.280000000001
right

5083.6 --> 5087.280000000001
so that would be my advice like

5087.76 --> 5091.84
figure out something constructive to do

5092.56 --> 5096.96
and go at it

5094.8 --> 5098.88
you probably have more energy to do it

5096.96 --> 5101.199
right now

5098.88 --> 5103.1990000000005
you just gotta realize it by stepping

5101.199 --> 5106.08
away from the down

5103.199 --> 5108.239
side of things

5106.08 --> 5111.28
just don't think about that

5108.239 --> 5113.5199999999995
just getting get to work

5111.28 --> 5116.96
i'm always great

5113.52 --> 5120.080000000001
i love telling people to get to work

5116.96 --> 5123.44
right especially when it's appropriate

5120.08 --> 5125.5199999999995
and i think it's hilarious that i i know

5123.44 --> 5127.5199999999995
that i am not the typical guy to

5125.52 --> 5130.320000000001
actually do it but i'm very good at

5127.52 --> 5132.4800000000005
telling people to get to work

5130.32 --> 5133.759999999999
and i know that's

5132.48 --> 5136.32
yeah

5133.76 --> 5138.320000000001
i know i get it

5136.32 --> 5140.239
but hey if it's a good time to say it

5138.32 --> 5141.44
then i'll say it you know because i like

5140.239 --> 5145.12
saying that

5141.44 --> 5145.12
anyway i'm gonna round out

5145.92 --> 5150.0
joke again yeah i knew it was a joke

5147.679 --> 5150.0
tony

5151.28 --> 5155.84
i've got to say you're a funny chief

5155.92 --> 5159.28

5157.92 --> 5161.12
thanks

5159.28 --> 5164.08
i'm not sure sometimes

5161.12 --> 5165.04
but maybe that's part of the joke

5164.08 --> 5167.6
right

5165.04 --> 5169.5199999999995
i feel a lot of the funniness of me is

5167.6 --> 5171.679
is really a joke on me and it doesn't

5169.52 --> 5173.52
have to necessarily be a humiliating

5171.679 --> 5175.679
joke

5173.52 --> 5177.4400000000005
i wouldn't like that

5175.679 --> 5178.4800000000005
love my passion

5177.44 --> 5180.719
thank you

5178.48 --> 5183.12
i am passionate

5180.719 --> 5185.199
i always have been and it's been quite a

5183.12 --> 5189.199
ride to basically

5185.199 --> 5189.199
prevent it from being destroyed

5189.84 --> 5196.28
to always get to the point where it can

5192.159 --> 5196.28
start welling up again

5197.52 --> 5202.719
it's like a fountain of youth

5199.76 --> 5205.1990000000005
and it is tied in with the ego it very

5202.719 --> 5205.199
much is

5207.199 --> 5212.159
one comes with the other anyway thanks

5209.92 --> 5213.679
everyone for coming i hope you liked

5212.159 --> 5216.32
this show

5213.679 --> 5219.84
and if you didn't well

5216.32 --> 5222.0
that means you're probably a gamma

5219.84 --> 5223.679
and i don't give a [ __ ]

5222.0 --> 5225.76
no mercy

5223.679 --> 5227.52
like downvote it all you want you know

5225.76 --> 5228.88
it doesn't really matter

5227.52 --> 5232.4800000000005
vote is a vote

5228.88 --> 5234.08
right the worst you could do to me

5232.48 --> 5236.239
is ignore me

5234.08 --> 5238.96
completely that means you don't click me

5236.239 --> 5239.759999999999
you don't watch me you don't think about

5238.96 --> 5240.639
me

5239.76 --> 5243.76
oh

5240.639 --> 5245.04
it's a little hard isn't it oh

5243.76 --> 5248.2390000000005
i know

5245.04 --> 5250.0
it's so tough actually doing the thing

5248.239 --> 5250.959999999999
that is best for you

5250.0 --> 5254.639
gamma

5250.96 --> 5257.92
i know i wouldn't want to be you

5254.639 --> 5260.96
i was almost gonna become you

5257.92 --> 5264.32
and then i decided no i'd rather sit

5260.96 --> 5265.199
through a lot of torture

5264.32 --> 5267.44
then

5265.199 --> 5270.719
get to the point where i realized that i

5267.44 --> 5270.719
have become the gamma

5270.88 --> 5274.4800000000005
right
