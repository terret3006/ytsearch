101.68 --> 104.72000000000001
there's a lot of moist in the air so

103.68 --> 108.47900000000001
even in this

104.72 --> 110.88
blue area there seems to be a lot of

108.479 --> 110.88
haze

111.52 --> 115.84
but yeah barely any wind

117.04 --> 122.47900000000001
even the clouds up there seems very slow

125.04 --> 130.399
still pretty warm and moist out there i

150.56 --> 159.2
humidity right since

156.0 --> 170.879
all right so it is

159.2 --> 173.35999999999999
thursday the 8th of july 2021

170.879 --> 177.04
i still got the noise gate on because

173.36 --> 177.04000000000002
there's a lot of noise outside still

177.36 --> 182.48000000000002
oh no beeping now it seems

182.84 --> 187.36
yeah a bit of a rough morning because

188.159 --> 194.879
basically beeping freaking eight o'clock

193.04 --> 196.07999999999998
it's quite disturbed i wasn't the only

194.879 --> 199.84
one somebody else

196.08 --> 201.59900000000002
actually got out of their house here

199.84 --> 202.879
asked him to please stop because it was

201.599 --> 207.2
extremely

202.879 --> 207.2
annoying not just to me

207.84 --> 216.72
so it did kind of like when my

213.44 --> 218.879
that beep man goes right through

216.72 --> 221.92
and it shook me up a bit so i'm i'm

218.879 --> 221.92
actually kind of annoyed

225.44 --> 233.92
hey zach you

229.28 --> 238.64
right so congratulations to

233.92 --> 238.64
england for reaching the

238.84 --> 243.04
finals

240.08 --> 243.04000000000002
european cup

243.12 --> 249.04
i think a lot of british people are

245.04 --> 249.04
probably gonna have a hangover right now

249.519 --> 254.87900000000002
because there's been some partying there

252.84 --> 257.199
yesterday

254.879 --> 258.32
yeah so i already saw some footage of

257.199 --> 260.56
that

258.32 --> 260.56
so

263.44 --> 269.84
expect the british to be all kind of

266.84 --> 269.84
late

283.6 --> 287.12
all right so watch some football

288.24 --> 291.6
watching rings

292.56 --> 311.84000000000003
third ugh

317.759 --> 322.56
so any uh reflections on things i said

320.639 --> 326.32
yesterday

322.56 --> 330.0
pretty uh riled up

326.32 --> 330.0
especially towards the s

330.96 --> 342.0
it's just going that's there

338.72 --> 342.0
somebody brings it up maybe

348.8 --> 353.84000000000003
[ __ ] it's getting to me i think

369.84 --> 375.19899999999996
so how are you doing tom parker zach

375.44 --> 384.16
is your day so far what are you doing

381.28 --> 386.88
any thoughts about my show yesterday or

384.16 --> 389.36
perhaps the flat earth debates

386.88 --> 389.36
anything

391.919 --> 396.56
but flat earth debate show yesterday was

394.08 --> 396.56
pretty good

397.84 --> 409.84
lasted long enough

410.319 --> 413.44
hey rocket blimps

414.96 --> 420.0
all right tom parker this morning it's

420.84 --> 423.84
fine

439.039 --> 443.44
do i really mean what i said yeah yeah i

441.84 --> 450.0
did

443.44 --> 453.36
absolutely i did zack every word of it

450.0 --> 456.639
i've been saying these things for

453.36 --> 456.639
almost a month now

460.56 --> 466.8
and wondering sometimes if people are

462.96 --> 466.79999999999995
even picking up on what i'm doing

473.52 --> 479.84
what are you talking about

482.56 --> 487.68
fireballs lifting up the sky i know

490.84 --> 493.84
what

504.84 --> 507.84
hmm

509.44 --> 514.159
huh wow

517.839 --> 521.839
that seems intense

525.12 --> 529.6
well that is definitely a local

526.959 --> 529.5999999999999
phenomenon

531.92 --> 537.68
that's for sure reminds me very much of

534.32 --> 537.6800000000001
the footage i've seen of those

537.76 --> 542.72
let's just call them meteors coming down

540.48 --> 543.6
over russia and then exploding right

542.72 --> 545.76
over the city

543.6 --> 547.9200000000001
like this looks exactly the same type of

545.76 --> 549.279
thing i don't know what causes it if

547.92 --> 551.5999999999999
it's natural or

549.279 --> 554.32
somebody catapulting that [ __ ] or

551.6 --> 556.72
whatever man

554.32 --> 559.36
but yeah that was definitely a physical

556.72 --> 559.36
phenomenon

560.48 --> 564.48
all right did you also know by the way

562.08 --> 567.2
that there is like a

564.48 --> 569.839
a supposed bilderberg meeting i don't

567.2 --> 571.76
even know if they even call it a bill

569.839 --> 572.8800000000001
but there is effectively a bilderberg

571.76 --> 577.4399999999999
meeting happening

572.88 --> 580.399
in idaho did you know that

577.44 --> 580.9590000000001
i heard a little about it on alex jones

580.399 --> 584.08
that he

580.959 --> 584.0799999999999
wasn't covering it

585.2 --> 592.1600000000001
uh is steve good servant uh well

589.12 --> 593.839
yeah good servant is steve but there's

592.16 --> 596.88
more steve's i

593.839 --> 598.24
i know about four steves that pop by

596.88 --> 601.8389999999999
here so

598.24 --> 601.839
rasta hat is also steve

602.56 --> 607.5189999999999
and there's other people's actually

604.72 --> 607.519
called steve

607.76 --> 614.3199999999999
their chat name but yes good

610.959 --> 619.8389999999999
servant is his name is steve

614.32 --> 619.839
that's right

620.24 --> 624.48
yeah tom parker well you see yes people

623.6 --> 627.36
have the right

624.48 --> 630.64
to chant stuff that's right they have

627.36 --> 633.92
the right to say whatever they want

630.64 --> 636.64
i have the right to point out how

633.92 --> 637.36
saying it makes no damn sense i have

636.64 --> 641.76
that right

637.36 --> 641.76
and it will ex yeah i will

644.24 --> 647.839
exercise that right

657.44 --> 664.32
hey tony whitcomb yeah i'm doing

661.2 --> 664.32
okay i'm a little

665.76 --> 670.24
a little out of it because basically the

667.839 --> 671.12
freaking beeping from yesterday woke me

670.24 --> 674.88
up

671.12 --> 677.04
really early at eight o'clock and that

674.88 --> 679.12
kept on going like half an hour and that

677.04 --> 681.4399999999999
really kind of disrupted my sleeping

679.12 --> 681.44
cycle

684.24 --> 689.2
on the preset of getting banned no

686.399 --> 693.04
that's about behavior tom parker

689.2 --> 695.9200000000001
that's about me addressing something

693.04 --> 698.3199999999999
and then the person i'm addressing not

695.92 --> 703.8389999999999
responding to it and continuing

698.32 --> 703.839
like ballers do right

704.24 --> 708.5600000000001
that's the precept getting banned

709.76 --> 716.24
right this place here my chat is not for

712.8 --> 718.639
chanting if you are gonna chant

716.24 --> 720.399
i will treat you as a chanter i don't

718.639 --> 722.88
care what you are chanting

720.399 --> 725.36
if it is a chant i will treat you like a

722.88 --> 725.36
chanter

729.12 --> 736.24
and i'm not gonna ban good servant

732.399 --> 738.72
right he's great but yeah i am going to

736.24 --> 739.44
basically try to correct him when he's

738.72 --> 744.1600000000001
stuck in

739.44 --> 747.6
in such behavior i will

744.16 --> 748.639
i will force it to his face even on his

747.6 --> 751.0400000000001
own streams

748.639 --> 751.6800000000001
i'm going to confront him there is no

751.04 --> 755.519
place

751.68 --> 759.279
i'm going to let him hide to safely

755.519 --> 761.92
chant no i demand

759.279 --> 762.72
the personal demand from within a

761.92 --> 764.3199999999999
friendship

762.72 --> 766.1600000000001
right i've known him for quite a while

764.32 --> 768.0790000000001
i've had personal one-on-one

766.16 --> 772.8
conversations with him private

768.079 --> 776.079
right i demand he listens to me

772.8 --> 779.12
and realizes it and moves

776.079 --> 782.6389999999999
moves inside of him beyond

779.12 --> 786.0
beyond that threshold of that chant

782.639 --> 788.76
i demand he thinks

786.0 --> 790.0
that's my personal demand that's my

788.76 --> 796.0
requirement

790.0 --> 796.0
towards him he wants to continue

798.839 --> 801.839
friendship

810.16 --> 815.8389999999999
doesn't mean anything harmful don't why

812.56 --> 815.8389999999999
are you saying that

821.92 --> 825.8389999999999
yeah well zack do you know that there's

824.959 --> 828.959
some other people

825.839 --> 831.0400000000001
also supposedly supporting me right

828.959 --> 832.079
mark smiler sent me a whole bunch of

831.04 --> 835.519
money

832.079 --> 839.279
and then he used that to try to drive me

835.519 --> 839.279
nuts with his [ __ ] right

840.0 --> 843.839
doesn't matter

859.199 --> 866.8
no i demand is you stop chanting

862.56 --> 870.6389999999999
i demand you respond to my argument

866.8 --> 872.8
yeah not accept my beliefs i'm not

870.639 --> 875.92
demanding you believe

872.8 --> 879.04
in anything right i'm not demanding you

875.92 --> 882.959
accept another freaking chant

879.04 --> 886.24
i demand you listen to my argument

882.959 --> 886.7199999999999
that's what i demand and i demand you

886.24 --> 890.72
stop

886.72 --> 894.0
chanting it's embarrassing you're

890.72 --> 896.5600000000001
embarrassing yourself

894.0 --> 897.279
every time you say something that you

896.56 --> 901.199
don't

897.279 --> 903.8389999999999
understand like the technicality of it

901.199 --> 904.399
you don't understand yeah i know what

903.839 --> 907.7600000000001
you've been

904.399 --> 911.04
taught to think about it

907.76 --> 913.76
i know that it's been echoed to no end

911.04 --> 915.5999999999999
for a thousand years i know it's echoed

913.76 --> 916.3199999999999
i know what you've been told to think

915.6 --> 920.32
about it

916.32 --> 924.0790000000001
and why i also know it makes

920.32 --> 927.36
no sense there's no technical

924.079 --> 930.88
logos there is no logical structure

927.36 --> 933.6
within its belief and i demand you stop

930.88 --> 934.079
chanting it i demand you stop saying

933.6 --> 937.44
things

934.079 --> 940.56
you don't understand and then expect

937.44 --> 945.36
others to accept that

940.56 --> 945.3599999999999
i demand you stop that that's my demand

949.04 --> 952.639
what makes me think he didn't listen to

950.8 --> 955.7589999999999
my point well

952.639 --> 959.519
the fact that he proceeded to echo

955.759 --> 961.12
the same chant again and then again

959.519 --> 962.639
that's what makes me think he didn't

961.12 --> 964.88
listen to my point

962.639 --> 965.759
because when you just make the same

964.88 --> 969.36
point

965.759 --> 970.0790000000001
in rebuttal that's usually most of the

969.36 --> 972.8000000000001
time

970.079 --> 973.519
in every discussion a sign that you're

972.8 --> 977.04
not

973.519 --> 983.12
listening yeah i have some experience

977.04 --> 986.399
with this

983.12 --> 986.72
no no no no sense it's not a sense for

986.399 --> 990.0
me

986.72 --> 993.519
it makes no logical sense you

990.0 --> 996.44
cannot put these things together

993.519 --> 997.68
and then explain cross-referencing to

996.44 --> 1000.399
everything

997.68 --> 1001.12
in the world every social interaction

1000.399 --> 1004.32
every

1001.12 --> 1007.92
mechanic of life every

1004.32 --> 1011.759
piece of history you cannot relate it

1007.92 --> 1014.88
to anything there is no logical

1011.759 --> 1018.32
sensible structure in the chant

1014.88 --> 1020.72
it makes no sense that's not my belief

1018.32 --> 1021.759
yeah it's not about belief it's about

1020.72 --> 1024.559
things making

1021.759 --> 1027.039
sense you shouldn't say things that make

1024.559 --> 1031.52
no sense

1027.039 --> 1031.52
yeah that's bad it's not good

1031.839 --> 1036.079
and i don't care why he echoes it

1034.48 --> 1038.48
because he believes it i don't give a

1036.079 --> 1041.4389999999999
[ __ ] about beliefs

1038.48 --> 1042.4
i want people to stop chanting things

1041.439 --> 1045.52
that make

1042.4 --> 1045.52
no sense

1047.919 --> 1052.0
yeah well go be human and weak and

1050.88 --> 1055.0390000000002
stupid then

1052.0 --> 1055.039
and piss off

1055.84 --> 1061.6
yeah if that's gonna be your rebuttal

1058.799 --> 1064.6399999999999
solipsism

1061.6 --> 1067.52
no i'm gonna hold you to task

1064.64 --> 1069.8400000000001
i'm going to demand you improve or get

1067.52 --> 1069.84
out

1075.919 --> 1081.8400000000001
don't strawman me tom parker

1096.799 --> 1102.24
the workmen are yeah they are though i

1100.08 --> 1105.52
think probably

1102.24 --> 1107.84
after this week there it's done because

1105.52 --> 1110.16
they've covered most of the inside here

1107.84 --> 1112.6399999999999
so it's probably

1110.16 --> 1114.72
going to be one more day tomorrow or

1112.64 --> 1116.96
maybe today it'll end and then it'll be

1114.72 --> 1116.96
gone

1117.44 --> 1123.8400000000001
finally can have some piece of quiet

1120.84 --> 1123.84
here

1132.7 --> 1135.92
[Music]

1145.96 --> 1149.38
[Music]

1153.39 --> 1161.729
[Music]

1176.84 --> 1179.84

extremely busy

1205.76 --> 1211.679
she still talks to me every now and then

1208.96 --> 1211.679
over skype

1215.919 --> 1220.0
i think that she might be like on a

1218.72 --> 1223.039
personal development

1220.0 --> 1225.36
route where she needs

1223.039 --> 1226.32
extra peace and quiet and not an are

1225.36 --> 1230.24
wind

1226.32 --> 1232.32
taking things a little far

1230.24 --> 1233.52
that's what i suspect it's usually the

1232.32 --> 1236.08
reason why people

1233.52 --> 1237.84
drop away for a while especially not

1236.08 --> 1239.84
saying anything about it and then come

1237.84 --> 1242.48
back

1239.84 --> 1244.24
because yeah i'm kind of intense at

1242.48 --> 1247.679
times

1244.24 --> 1249.84
and sometimes some people

1247.679 --> 1253.1200000000001
when they normally appreciate it there

1249.84 --> 1256.48
they find themselves in the mood

1253.12 --> 1259.28
like a phase where they can't really do

1256.48 --> 1263.84
anything with it so they just step away

1259.28 --> 1263.84
and i'm perfectly fine with that

1267.679 --> 1273.76
and there's others too i think

1270.72 --> 1274.72
i'm just never on rmp he's kind of done

1273.76 --> 1276.08
with me i don't

1274.72 --> 1279.3600000000001
i don't even know if you'll ever come

1276.08 --> 1282.6399999999999
back but i apparently said some things

1279.36 --> 1284.7199999999998
that he finds unacceptable or maybe it

1282.64 --> 1287.76
is that i

1284.72 --> 1291.3600000000001
criticize certain individuals

1287.76 --> 1294.08
and have a different stance now

1291.36 --> 1294.08
sometimes

1294.96 --> 1299.6000000000001
friendship can be very polarizing

1300.48 --> 1304.4
somebody they perceive as an important

1302.84 --> 1309.28
friend

1304.4 --> 1312.4
yeah gets some kind of social friction

1309.28 --> 1315.12
conflict and they might be very

1312.4 --> 1317.76
polarized in their response

1315.12 --> 1319.6
so that could be the case i don't know

1317.76 --> 1321.52
seeking star wars too

1319.6 --> 1324.7199999999998
i don't know what's going on i still it

1321.52 --> 1324.72
was still in chat yes

1325.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
evan from her in

1330.84 --> 1333.84
response

1346.0 --> 1352.24
but yeah maybe it's also because of the

1349.12 --> 1356.4799999999998
kind of rigid social conduct that i do

1352.24 --> 1357.2
uphold here since my class is pretty

1356.48 --> 1359.919
strict

1357.2 --> 1361.28
and in a way merciless i think that some

1359.919 --> 1364.3200000000002
people don't like that

1361.28 --> 1364.72
right so i'm pretty sure that a lot of

1364.32 --> 1367.52
you

1364.72 --> 1368.799
don't like the way that i handle good

1367.52 --> 1371.9189999999999
servant

1368.799 --> 1372.84
i don't know he's a he's a really really

1371.919 --> 1376.0800000000002
nice guy

1372.84 --> 1379.28
right the thing though is that

1376.08 --> 1389.84
being nice does not make you

1379.28 --> 1389.84
exempt in any way

1390.88 --> 1395.5200000000002
so yeah well that that's i don't know

1393.28 --> 1398.6399999999999
why where overwent

1395.52 --> 1398.6399999999999
but here we go again

1401.6 --> 1403.84
okay

1405.2 --> 1408.72
now of course she doesn't need

1409.28 --> 1413.28
hitting on my fans what are you talking

1411.2 --> 1415.039
about

1413.28 --> 1417.36
i have the highest respect for robin

1415.039 --> 1420.32
stanley

1417.36 --> 1420.32
you're getting this from

1420.96 --> 1427.279
i'm just trying to kind of define why

1424.799 --> 1427.279
why she

1427.84 --> 1431.12
just not be in the in the mood for my

1430.72 --> 1436.0
show

1431.12 --> 1436.0
that's all [ __ ] on my fans

1442.159 --> 1447.6000000000001
we are not my students okay well if you

1444.88 --> 1450.24
don't want to be my student

1447.6 --> 1450.24
then don't

1450.64 --> 1458.0
right but i am here

1455.279 --> 1459.36
in function as a teacher that is part of

1458.0 --> 1463.44
what i do

1459.36 --> 1463.4399999999998
if you don't want to be my student in it

1463.52 --> 1477.039
i can't make you

1473.6 --> 1479.279
i i certainly do hope

1477.039 --> 1480.8799999999999
that you will be paying attention oh you

1479.279 --> 1482.96
are not well why don't you speak for

1480.88 --> 1487.8400000000001
yourself here we go again

1482.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
why don't you speak for yourself

1492.159 --> 1496.96
i'm a student i'm a student to you guys

1497.039 --> 1502.64
and hey it would be in your own benefit

1500.24 --> 1505.44
if you were the same towards me

1502.64 --> 1507.8400000000001
right that's how you learn by being a

1505.44 --> 1507.8400000000001
student

1508.4 --> 1515.8400000000001
teacher that grows is a student

1512.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
as well

1542.159 --> 1547.0390000000002
reject greek logos is that what

1547.76 --> 1555.12
that's a very complicated thing to say

1551.52 --> 1557.84
don't talk to me here we go again uh

1555.12 --> 1557.84
are you all right

1561.36 --> 1571.84
i'm not talking down to you but i'm

1564.48 --> 1571.84
losing my patience though

1591.52 --> 1599.84
strange thing to say cleary

1620.559 --> 1624.799
right so does anybody have anything

1624.84 --> 1627.84
technical

1630.64 --> 1634.96
i mean i'm pretty sure that i got the

1633.279 --> 1638.0
message by now that

1634.96 --> 1640.08
you don't always like a lot of you don't

1638.0 --> 1642.159
like how i deal with the people in my

1640.08 --> 1644.399
chat sometimes

1642.159 --> 1644.3990000000001
right

1647.44 --> 1652.24
i think i think that's that message came

1649.52 --> 1656.32
across now yeah

1652.24 --> 1656.32
so can we now move on

1656.399 --> 1659.4399999999998
or is this the moment where you're all

1658.159 --> 1662.3200000000002
going to make your stand

1659.44 --> 1663.6000000000001
and decide to boycott me because hey if

1662.32 --> 1664.8799999999999
that's what it's going to be

1663.6 --> 1666.9599999999998
then that's what it's going to be

1664.88 --> 1672.3200000000002
because i'm not going to change anything

1666.96 --> 1672.32
not a thing thing i do i do for a reason

1672.72 --> 1676.64
and i make those reasons blatantly

1675.679 --> 1679.279
apparent

1676.64 --> 1679.8400000000001
time in and again just like i did in

1679.279 --> 1683.44
this

1679.84 --> 1685.9189999999999
show thus far and i'm not going to stop

1683.44 --> 1688.799
doing that

1685.919 --> 1691.5200000000002
and if you don't accept that that's not

1688.799 --> 1691.52
my problem

1693.6 --> 1697.84
yeah a chant for me tom parker

1704.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
hey clutch bear yeah there's a lot of

1707.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
drama today it seems

1719.12 --> 1723.6
yeah i will freaking deny it i will deny

1721.679 --> 1727.279
everything that makes no sense

1723.6 --> 1730.399
yeah i deny the technical

1727.279 --> 1734.399
logic behind the idea that

1730.399 --> 1737.76
god would pray to himself

1734.399 --> 1740.2399999999998
and in a third person version

1737.76 --> 1742.64
i deny that i deny that makes any

1740.24 --> 1746.32
logical consistent sense yes i do

1742.64 --> 1748.5590000000002
i deny that yeah i don't think jesus had

1746.32 --> 1752.96
a split personality

1748.559 --> 1755.279
yeah is that insulting to say that

1752.96 --> 1758.08
is that an insult to say that jesus did

1755.279 --> 1762.88
not have a split personality

1758.08 --> 1762.8799999999999
being god no i don't think so

1763.039 --> 1766.799
oh it's a lack of knowledge i just don't

1765.12 --> 1770.2399999999998
understand

1766.799 --> 1773.679
the body the body of the works

1770.24 --> 1776.159
right don't think about logic

1773.679 --> 1777.039
don't think about the arguments that are

1776.159 --> 1780.88
given to you

1777.039 --> 1783.2
in response no no it's the body of work

1780.88 --> 1785.6000000000001
i just didn't read it enough

1783.2 --> 1787.039
maybe if i chant some more i'll start

1785.6 --> 1789.9189999999999
believing it

1787.039 --> 1793.2
i'll start to see the logic even though

1789.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
i couldn't mechanically point it out

1793.2 --> 1795.8400000000001
i don't think so

1796.399 --> 1801.84
yeah yeah you and your father are one

1799.2 --> 1801.8400000000001
sure you are

1803.6 --> 1809.039
yeah see that see that right there right

1806.84 --> 1812.399
there

1809.039 --> 1812.399
keep chanting for me tom

1818.559 --> 1822.0
no clutch bear here we go again just as

1820.559 --> 1824.48
another mood always does

1822.0 --> 1824.48
that [ __ ]

1827.94 --> 1832.96
[Music]

1830.72 --> 1834.84
yes tom parker and i'm sure that when

1832.96 --> 1838.08
jesus said that he meant

1834.84 --> 1842.1589999999999
literally literally that

1838.08 --> 1842.8799999999999
yeah just like when you're reborn after

1842.159 --> 1845.679
baptism

1842.88 --> 1847.0390000000002
that means you're literally reborn right

1845.679 --> 1850.3200000000002
because jesus is

1847.039 --> 1851.679
always literal he's never metaphorical

1850.32 --> 1855.52
in anything he doesn't

1851.679 --> 1859.3600000000001
ever speak about esoterics it's all

1855.52 --> 1861.12
literal that you're literally reborn

1859.36 --> 1863.039
yet you literally come out of your

1861.12 --> 1879.84
mother's vagina again

1863.039 --> 1879.84
yeah yeah

1891.04 --> 1894.089
[Music]

1897.039 --> 1905.2
in spirit oh

1900.32 --> 1907.6789999999999
so you're telling me i am

1905.2 --> 1911.039
this is hilarious so now you're

1907.679 --> 1914.48
basically denying the premise

1911.039 --> 1917.519
i am my father

1914.48 --> 1920.3990000000001
i and my father are one

1917.519 --> 1920.799
so it's in spirit so it's in spirit

1920.399 --> 1924.7199999999998
right

1920.799 --> 1927.679
so it's not literally right

1924.72 --> 1929.84
not literally then you're now admitting

1927.679 --> 1931.919
it

1929.84 --> 1933.519
born of the spirit yeah yeah but that's

1931.919 --> 1936.5590000000002
still not literally

1933.519 --> 1939.6
right that's talk about spirit

1936.559 --> 1942.2
about frequency about esoterics

1939.6 --> 1943.6
you know the thing that i like to be

1942.2 --> 1946.96
differentiate

1943.6 --> 1950.32
to make very clear what is esoteric

1946.96 --> 1952.64
what is literal yeah i know that's what

1950.32 --> 1952.6399999999999
i do

1958.559 --> 1963.84
no good server nobody called you a turn

1960.84 --> 1963.84
code

1968.559 --> 1972.96
it's just clutchbear overreacting a

1970.559 --> 1975.6
little clutchbear is already on my side

1972.96 --> 1979.6000000000001
with this because owen benjamin

1975.6 --> 1982.48
does this all the time

1979.6 --> 1983.4399999999998
so a lot of people that follow him are

1982.48 --> 1987.64
very well

1983.44 --> 1991.6000000000001
trained to respond with chanters

1987.64 --> 1995.44
trinitarians as owen benjamin calls them

1991.6 --> 1995.4399999999998
yeah and so do i

1997.2 --> 2003.519
esoteric is jesus [ __ ] no esoteric

2000.48 --> 2007.88
literally is the core meaning

2003.519 --> 2010.96
behind something the existential

2007.88 --> 2014.5590000000002
implications meaning

2010.96 --> 2017.6000000000001
the spiritual insight structure

2014.559 --> 2020.559
that's esoteric it's not

2017.6 --> 2022.08
mumbo jumbo it's only mumbo jumbo to

2020.559 --> 2027.44
those who do not have

2022.08 --> 2031.279
the senses cleared up enough to see it

2027.44 --> 2034.0
and you do see it then you know

2031.279 --> 2035.12
others that see it too and you can

2034.0 --> 2038.399
communicate

2035.12 --> 2040.6399999999999
that you understand that thing that you

2038.399 --> 2040.6399999999999
see

2040.88 --> 2047.8400000000001
and then you share the esoteric insight

2048.639 --> 2061.839
hey gaining wisdom

2072.839 --> 2075.839
um

2083.599 --> 2087.599
that's right good servant i will you're

2086.24 --> 2090.0
still welcome here though

2087.599 --> 2092.639
and i appreciate if you wouldn't join in

2090.0 --> 2094.56
the chanting

2092.639 --> 2096.639
if you have a lot of trouble resisting

2094.56 --> 2098.4
that then maybe yeah maybe you should

2096.639 --> 2103.839
step away for a bit

2098.4 --> 2103.839
i would respect that

2115.76 --> 2118.0
ah

2123.52 --> 2128.48
it seems to finally gonna maneuver that

2125.76 --> 2132.32
thing out of here

2128.48 --> 2134.88
yeah tom parker i'm not going to

2132.32 --> 2137.3590000000004
virtue signal to your chanting if

2134.88 --> 2138.32
chanting is what you do in your life and

2137.359 --> 2141.359
that is the most

2138.32 --> 2143.6800000000003
important thing of all then

2141.359 --> 2146.24
this is not the place for you i don't

2143.68 --> 2146.24
want that

2149.119 --> 2152.2400000000002
there's nothing productive about that

2151.359 --> 2156.839
there's nothing

2152.24 --> 2159.839
you are going to learn from that or

2156.839 --> 2159.839
anybody

2164.03 --> 2167.1090000000004

all right well you telling me that

2275.599 --> 2285.839
is good thank you appreciate that

2288.64 --> 2292.96
kind of annoying that it got removed

2292.96 --> 2298.2400000000002
i would have liked to see it would have

2295.04 --> 2298.24
liked to have seen that

2298.56 --> 2302.4
all right thank you

2307.04 --> 2310.96
tom parker can you please take your

2309.04 --> 2312.32
chanting somewhere else i'm sick of

2310.96 --> 2314.8
hearing this [ __ ]

2312.32 --> 2316.7200000000003
are you in chat it's not creating a

2314.8 --> 2319.3590000000004
conversation

2316.72 --> 2321.04
you're not saying things that people can

2319.359 --> 2323.5989999999997
learn anything from

2321.04 --> 2324.32
you're literally chanting and the

2323.599 --> 2327.839
chanting

2324.32 --> 2327.839
is all pointless

2335.2 --> 2341.2
that's right clutch bear and i totally

2337.44 --> 2344.64
agree with you in that

2341.2 --> 2345.68
yeah big bear said it a little bit

2344.64 --> 2350.24
harder

2345.68 --> 2353.359
and that is everybody that's obsessed

2350.24 --> 2355.04
with this riddle this giant list are

2353.359 --> 2357.92
riddles

2355.04 --> 2360.24
that centralize jesus's death to be the

2357.92 --> 2363.839
all-important thing yeah

2360.24 --> 2364.64
they're satanists the people that follow

2363.839 --> 2368.16
it don't even

2364.64 --> 2371.7599999999998
realize it satanists

2368.16 --> 2374.56
yeah anything that would deflect

2371.76 --> 2376.48
from the actual esoterics of the

2374.56 --> 2380.56
teachings of jesus

2376.48 --> 2384.56
and yet instead

2380.56 --> 2387.68
focus purely on this supposed

2384.56 --> 2390.32
mighty influence of his death

2387.68 --> 2391.04
and make everything about that yeah

2390.32 --> 2394.8
that's

2391.04 --> 2396.72
satanism ah

2394.8 --> 2398.96
there you go i'm not the first to say

2396.72 --> 2398.9599999999996
that

2405.28 --> 2409.0400000000004
we're both wrong and we'll find out yeah

2407.119 --> 2412.4
we will we will

2409.04 --> 2415.839
oh yes i will

2412.4 --> 2418.1600000000003
sound like you worship satan and that's

2415.839 --> 2419.839
where you get a timeout the next time

2418.16 --> 2422.839
you say something like that because i

2419.839 --> 2425.7599999999998
didn't even point fingers at you

2422.839 --> 2429.359
yeah next time you do that you're

2425.76 --> 2438.88
banned go to your chanting rooms

2429.359 --> 2441.7599999999998
this is not one of them

2438.88 --> 2443.2000000000003
that's right clutch bear because you

2441.76 --> 2446.88
won't be led into heaven

2443.2 --> 2450.0789999999997
unless you know everything about how

2446.88 --> 2450.6400000000003
god broke man's law in order to change

2450.079 --> 2452.88
the plan

2450.64 --> 2454.72
which he of course could have because he

2452.88 --> 2457.44
is almighty

2454.72 --> 2458.16
but he had to break his own law for a

2457.44 --> 2461.599
man

2458.16 --> 2462.3999999999996
one giant time so that all people could

2461.599 --> 2464.319
learn

2462.4 --> 2466.64
that it doesn't matter what the [ __ ]

2464.319 --> 2468.64
they do because they're forgiven anyway

2466.64 --> 2469.92
because jesus was slaughtered so they

2468.64 --> 2480.48
could sin

2469.92 --> 2483.539
yeah that's not satanic at all

2480.48 --> 2483.539
[Music]

2500.16 --> 2503.92
but that's fine i demand to be judged i

2502.96 --> 2508.0
demand

2503.92 --> 2511.839
god judge me i demand it i want it i

2508.0 --> 2516.079
need judgment i am hungry for judgment

2511.839 --> 2516.0789999999997
for myself and the world

2516.88 --> 2520.96
and i know you can't demand judgment for

2520.319 --> 2524.0
the world

2520.96 --> 2527.839
unless you accept judgment for

2524.0 --> 2527.839
you and that's what i do

2530.52 --> 2533.59
[Music]

2534.8 --> 2538.6400000000003
god i don't know what little god is

2543.599 --> 2550.56
big g god is outside of

2547.359 --> 2553.44
space and time

2550.56 --> 2553.44
oh encompassing

2559.44 --> 2563.2000000000003

2636.88 --> 2639.44

that's messed up

2649.119 --> 2652.319
anyway if you want me to see the

2651.44 --> 2654.16

2654.16 --> 2659.92
somewhere just send it to my email

2658.079 --> 2662.079
i'll read it like that i would

2659.92 --> 2665.359
appreciate with some of you to have

2662.079 --> 2666.96
email contact like that because just

2665.359 --> 2668.4
through the youtube platform

2666.96 --> 2673.2
communication is not

2668.4 --> 2673.2000000000003
super reliable appreciate

2673.359 --> 2678.7999999999997
having email contact

2676.88 --> 2681.6800000000003
so maybe that could be a solution guns

2678.8 --> 2681.6800000000003
have never run rmp

2682.319 --> 2686.8
you know where to find it it's in the

2683.839 --> 2686.7999999999997
description box

2688.96 --> 2696.079
it's anthropomorphism no it's just

2693.04 --> 2698.079
when you talk about something you regard

2696.079 --> 2700.079
as an entity you're gonna

2698.079 --> 2701.6800000000003
give it as a surname so you're gonna

2700.079 --> 2704.5600000000004
call it he she

2701.68 --> 2705.7599999999998
whatever you know if you're really into

2704.56 --> 2708.0789999999997
she

2705.76 --> 2709.6800000000003
then you might call anything is she

2708.079 --> 2712.96
you're really into

2709.68 --> 2715.839
he and you want to exclude anything

2712.96 --> 2716.96
female then you might call anything he i

2715.839 --> 2720.48
don't really care

2716.96 --> 2723.76
i see god as the father

2720.48 --> 2727.119
just like jesus did see

2723.76 --> 2730.1600000000003
him not himself as the father

2727.119 --> 2733.44
right so i'm just gonna take his example

2730.16 --> 2735.68
as my example and i think that's just

2733.44 --> 2735.68
fine

2735.839 --> 2742.16
okay goodbye tom parker get the [ __ ] out

2738.56 --> 2742.16
i don't have to ever see you again

2743.2 --> 2747.839
with you get out of here

2748.57 --> 2754.1600000000003
[Music]

2751.52 --> 2761.2
it's not even the first time it might be

2754.16 --> 2764.24
the last time though

2761.2 --> 2767.52
are christianity in islam similar

2764.24 --> 2767.52
in many ways yes

2773.44 --> 2776.96
guns are never i'm a christian too i'm

2775.52 --> 2780.72
just not a

2776.96 --> 2784.079
priestly indoctrinated chanter

2780.72 --> 2788.3999999999996
group huggy sheep christian

2784.079 --> 2792.319
yeah i actually take jesus's words

2788.4 --> 2795.6800000000003
very seriously and i don't take

2792.319 --> 2798.8
other people's blabbering on about

2795.68 --> 2803.839
it very seriously just

2798.8 --> 2803.8390000000004
his words very serious

2826.22 --> 2829.27
[Music]

2857.52 --> 2873.839
which what cleary

2879.04 --> 2883.16
yeah i don't need your prayer i need you

2881.04 --> 2886.319
to understand

2883.16 --> 2888.96
understand logos

2886.319 --> 2888.96
logic

2889.44 --> 2894.8
the acceptance of creation the design

2894.96 --> 2902.16
the rules of how things work

2899.04 --> 2906.4
with the entirety of reality as the

2902.16 --> 2909.68
example yeah not some chants

2906.4 --> 2913.359
that make no sense

2909.68 --> 2916.0789999999997
don't need prayers from chanting people

2913.359 --> 2917.44
that are afraid because i don't echo

2916.079 --> 2921.44
their chants

2917.44 --> 2925.76
no i actually listen to jesus's words

2921.44 --> 2925.76
i take them extremely serious

2927.119 --> 2947.119
this isn't truth no

2943.28 --> 2951.2000000000003
it is a mind-expanding consideration

2947.119 --> 2951.2000000000003
hermeticism it's not truth though

2951.76 --> 2955.0400000000004
there's a lot wrong with it

2955.359 --> 2958.5589999999997
i've already addressed that

2962.96 --> 2966.2400000000002
here we go again god doesn't have a

2965.2 --> 2969.359
gender

2966.24 --> 2970.72
here's a hint for you why are you

2969.359 --> 2974.7999999999997
talking about it

2970.72 --> 2978.5589999999997
why do you feel the need to say that

2974.8 --> 2978.559
why does it matter

2979.28 --> 2982.8390000000004
what are the implications to what does

2982.16 --> 2986.72
it

2982.839 --> 2990.48
matter why are you focused on this

2986.72 --> 2990.48
on this little dichotomy

2991.119 --> 2999.839
what's so important about

3011.68 --> 3016.96
coach men burn all the females witches

3014.88 --> 3019.76
no that's not the reason they burned the

3016.96 --> 3019.76
fishes

3023.04 --> 3029.2799999999997
those are excuses that are used

3026.319 --> 3030.8
in the theocracy bureaucracy to

3029.28 --> 3032.8
eventually send them

3030.8 --> 3035.28
to their deaths right yeah that's what

3032.8 --> 3038.1600000000003
it signed with no the reason is

3035.28 --> 3038.96
they knew [ __ ] they knew esoterics they

3038.16 --> 3042.0
had learned

3038.96 --> 3045.119
a lot and they were rebellious in nature

3042.0 --> 3047.599
that's that's

3045.119 --> 3049.2000000000003
why they yeah why they got haunted down

3047.599 --> 3051.2000000000003
it's terrible

3049.2 --> 3052.4399999999996
it's terrible that that happened right

3051.2 --> 3055.9199999999996
it's not because they

3052.44 --> 3058.64
disagreed with a male god yeah that's

3055.92 --> 3058.64
projection

3060.0 --> 3066.8
like that isn't relevant to anything

3063.76 --> 3069.92
that's literally a chant argument

3066.8 --> 3073.04
chanting it's like oh you don't want to

3069.92 --> 3077.28
say the word with this little

3073.04 --> 3080.4
detail in that way you're a heretic

3077.28 --> 3083.8390000000004
yeah that's that's what happens with a

3080.4 --> 3087.599
chant religion yeah that demands

3083.839 --> 3090.48
you chant it or you are the enemy yeah

3087.599 --> 3093.76
what does that have to do with wisdom

3090.48 --> 3097.04
with valuable teachings for your life

3093.76 --> 3100.559
nothing the only thing it results in

3097.04 --> 3103.599
is people having a giant pecking order

3100.559 --> 3105.2000000000003
and a library of chants and if somebody

3103.599 --> 3110.1600000000003
falls out of line

3105.2 --> 3112.8799999999997
they die yeah that's called a cult

3110.16 --> 3112.8799999999997
a cult

3114.079 --> 3119.2000000000003
that's not following the teachings of

3116.079 --> 3122.96
jesus everything he said

3119.2 --> 3123.4399999999996
directly opposes all those ways of going

3122.96 --> 3129.599
about

3123.44 --> 3129.599
all that directly opposed by his words

3135.599 --> 3141.3590000000004
again please go to a feminist forum i'm

3137.76 --> 3141.3590000000004
getting really annoyed by this [ __ ]

3142.48 --> 3153.839
this is not for chanting not even for

3144.64 --> 3153.839
that form of chanting

3161.359 --> 3167.839
hmm it's a good one gaining wisdom

3184.0 --> 3192.4
ew we go again go away

3189.119 --> 3197.52
do i need to time you out

3192.4 --> 3200.88
go away i don't need to hear this crap

3197.52 --> 3203.92
go to your feminist protest or whatever

3200.88 --> 3203.92
do it somewhere else

3206.64 --> 3213.7599999999998
yeah i don't care i will not be made to

3210.319 --> 3217.52
care by your mood yeah

3213.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
your mood has no power here

3217.52 --> 3223.839
let that be clear

3240.319 --> 3243.599
yes guns have never of course that's a

3242.4 --> 3246.4
lot of trolls that are

3243.599 --> 3248.319
desperately waiting in line the no life

3246.4 --> 3250.559
trolls are waiting in line to

3248.319 --> 3251.359
try to sow some kind of seeds of

3250.559 --> 3253.119
division

3251.359 --> 3256.0
because they don't understand what's

3253.119 --> 3258.7200000000003
happening they don't even understand

3256.0 --> 3260.079
what's going on right now why people are

3258.72 --> 3263.04
getting timed out

3260.079 --> 3264.0
by getting giving pretty harsh criticism

3263.04 --> 3265.52
and judgment towards

3264.0 --> 3267.599
people in chat they don't even

3265.52 --> 3269.359
understand what's going on

3267.599 --> 3271.6800000000003
so they're just like oh oh they're

3269.359 --> 3272.7999999999997
finally fighting oh my god is it finally

3271.68 --> 3275.44
gonna end

3272.8 --> 3276.319
oh arwen is finally destroying his own

3275.44 --> 3278.559
channel let's

3276.319 --> 3279.92
oh let's try to make it worse because

3278.559 --> 3283.3590000000004
they don't know what the

3279.92 --> 3286.48
[ __ ] is going on they're so demented

3283.359 --> 3289.68
these people these trolls

3286.48 --> 3292.319
that do that they're so demented

3289.68 --> 3292.8799999999997
they don't know what the [ __ ] is going

3292.319 --> 3296.16
on

3292.88 --> 3300.079
with anything anything

3296.16 --> 3302.64
they are below goblin intelligence

3300.079 --> 3303.3590000000004
like the actual goblins in lord of the

3302.64 --> 3306.5589999999997
rings

3303.359 --> 3307.2
have more intellectual acuity than these

3306.559 --> 3309.6800000000003
people

3307.2 --> 3310.64
it the trolls that pop up in chat with

3309.68 --> 3314.799
their sock names

3310.64 --> 3317.359
yeah they are so demented

3314.799 --> 3318.079
a bunny rabbit would make smarter

3317.359 --> 3321.5989999999997
decisions

3318.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
would have more insight

3321.599 --> 3335.839
all right

3337.839 --> 3342.319
so indeed guns have never owned

3339.2 --> 3349.839
squirters are appearing yep

3342.319 --> 3349.839
that's fine

3360.24 --> 3364.72
be kind to thy neighbor no no treat thy

3363.76 --> 3368.079
neighbor as

3364.72 --> 3371.4399999999996
if they are yourself yeah

3368.079 --> 3374.559
it's not be kind now that's

3371.44 --> 3378.4
actually uphold the same standard

3374.559 --> 3381.8390000000004
to words others close to you

3378.4 --> 3385.28
not necessarily related as you

3381.839 --> 3387.599
uphold the standards for yourself that's

3385.28 --> 3391.52
the esoteric message it's not

3387.599 --> 3395.6800000000003
be kind because be kind

3391.52 --> 3395.68
has no context yeah

3402.4 --> 3406.1600000000003
don't feed the trolls guns have never

3404.16 --> 3407.92
owned if i'm if i ban them just don't

3406.16 --> 3411.1189999999997
respond they are they are not

3407.92 --> 3412.88
individuals they are meaning little

3411.119 --> 3414.96
goblins

3412.88 --> 3419.839
they don't communicate they're only

3414.96 --> 3419.839
trying to poke

3425.2 --> 3431.9199999999996
love thy neighbors as you love thyself

3427.119 --> 3434.0
right that's a better way to say it

3431.92 --> 3437.28
because it is all about

3434.0 --> 3440.559
the same treatment for them as you

3437.28 --> 3444.3190000000004
that's the essence that's

3440.559 --> 3447.6800000000003
the esoterics of that message

3444.319 --> 3451.2799999999997
it's not be kind no it's treat them

3447.68 --> 3454.8799999999997
the same as yourself

3451.28 --> 3458.48
that's the esoteric message

3454.88 --> 3458.799
you understand i know that i understand

3458.48 --> 3463.44
that

3458.799 --> 3463.44
all too well do you

3470.799 --> 3476.4
be not wrathful to your neighbor well

3474.079 --> 3478.7200000000003
if they are completely out of control

3476.4 --> 3480.1600000000003
and they need somebody to snap them out

3478.72 --> 3481.9199999999996
of it

3480.16 --> 3483.68
or they are drowning in their own

3481.92 --> 3486.48
arrogance

3483.68 --> 3488.72
then you should definitely not treat

3486.48 --> 3492.799
them with a soft hand

3488.72 --> 3496.0789999999997
because practically in reality

3492.799 --> 3499.7599999999998
yeah that doesn't work

3496.079 --> 3503.599
so i disagree no no

3499.76 --> 3506.7990000000004
treat them as you treat yourself

3503.599 --> 3509.3590000000004
so when you would be in a way that you

3506.799 --> 3512.64
require help and love

3509.359 --> 3516.16
from your surroundings because you

3512.64 --> 3517.7599999999998
you really need it and you

3516.16 --> 3519.44
hope that others will give it to you

3517.76 --> 3522.48
that's why you should give it

3519.44 --> 3524.319
but if you are out of control not

3522.48 --> 3526.16
because some trolls that have really

3524.319 --> 3527.599
triggered decide that you are out of

3526.16 --> 3529.7599999999998
control but because you

3527.599 --> 3530.6400000000003
find out for yourself you are out of

3529.76 --> 3533.92
control

3530.64 --> 3536.319
you've said things that you regret

3533.92 --> 3539.2000000000003
then don't you realize that it would

3536.319 --> 3542.64
have been great if somebody actually

3539.2 --> 3544.64
got but pretty stern with you

3542.64 --> 3546.24
and that's why you shouldn't always be

3544.64 --> 3548.0789999999997
soft with everybody you should just

3546.24 --> 3548.8799999999997
treat them as you would want to be

3548.079 --> 3551.28
treated

3548.88 --> 3559.839
and that includes a hard hand when

3551.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
necessary when called for

3561.68 --> 3566.96
okay well here we go again good [ __ ] off

3564.72 --> 3566.9599999999996
then

3570.0 --> 3577.119
if you can't control your own triggering

3573.52 --> 3579.359
after all these years i don't need you

3577.119 --> 3579.359
here

3580.319 --> 3585.68
i i don't care yeah go join perfection

3583.76 --> 3587.0400000000004
and all the others that have a grudge

3585.68 --> 3591.359
and they'll have it for

3587.04 --> 3594.96
years yeah well guess what i don't need

3591.359 --> 3598.319
people around here that can't control

3594.96 --> 3599.839
their own impulses and that hold grudges

3598.319 --> 3602.319
for no good reason

3599.839 --> 3602.96
yeah so if that's what you're gonna

3602.319 --> 3606.319
choose

3602.96 --> 3609.839
to do and supposedly try to make

3606.319 --> 3612.0
me change the way that i am what i do

3609.839 --> 3615.839
here

3612.0 --> 3619.04
then i choose not to accept you

3615.839 --> 3629.839
do you understand you can't control

3619.04 --> 3629.839
your own impulses get out here

3636.24 --> 3638.5589999999997
right

3639.52 --> 3644.079
i mean i've appreciated our time here

3641.52 --> 3645.68
together here we go again

3644.079 --> 3647.3590000000004
but this is not the first time you

3645.68 --> 3649.52
started acting like this you've

3647.359 --> 3651.2799999999997
apologized for it before i don't know if

3649.52 --> 3654.72
you will now

3651.28 --> 3658.88
right but if

3654.72 --> 3662.24
this is going to be a reoccurring thing

3658.88 --> 3665.839
then i choose not to treat you

3662.24 --> 3668.839
softly and instead treat you harshly

3665.839 --> 3670.16
until you get a freaking grip over

3668.839 --> 3674.24
yourself

3670.16 --> 3676.0
and only then will i accept you back

3674.24 --> 3678.319
and that's the way it's going to be and

3676.0 --> 3685.839
i don't care what you think or feel

3678.319 --> 3685.839
about that

3702.22 --> 3705.4199999999996
[Music]

3708.64 --> 3716.3489999999997
[Music]

3718.64 --> 3725.0389999999998
yeah just know that your inability to

3722.48 --> 3728.319
let go of your impulses

3725.039 --> 3731.2000000000003
have now degradated your position here

3728.319 --> 3733.2
below tiny womble right and he's a

3731.2 --> 3738.5589999999997
baller

3733.2 --> 3742.799
right but yeah that's fine he's a baller

3738.559 --> 3746.1600000000003
he knows how to freaking control himself

3742.799 --> 3755.839
yeah that makes him

3746.16 --> 3755.839
better to have around

3761.28 --> 3769.8390000000004
tara 306 what are you watching

3779.599 --> 3783.839
cricket okay

3784.24 --> 3790.16
what did she do she started blabbering

3787.44 --> 3793.68
on about feminism and how it's

3790.16 --> 3795.68
which persecution because of men and god

3793.68 --> 3799.2799999999997
wanting everything to be meant she got

3795.68 --> 3802.64
obsessed over being enslaved as a woman

3799.28 --> 3804.0
he literally got totally obsessed with

3802.64 --> 3805.92
it

3804.0 --> 3809.039
and then she started to project that

3805.92 --> 3809.039
obsession onto me

3809.28 --> 3812.799
say that i'm a suppressor i stifle

3812.16 --> 3815.839
voices

3812.799 --> 3820.0
and she doesn't like me anymore

3815.839 --> 3822.4
yeah that's such utter horseshit

3820.0 --> 3823.359
it's unacceptable after everything we've

3822.4 --> 3826.2400000000002
been through that is

3823.359 --> 3826.88
absolutely unacceptable to say in my

3826.24 --> 3831.2
chat

3826.88 --> 3834.1600000000003
or her she should have known better i

3831.2 --> 3835.2
literally told her to step away and she

3834.16 --> 3838.24
didn't

3835.2 --> 3840.0
yeah that low impulse control and then

3838.24 --> 3842.0
you pay the price

3840.0 --> 3852.78
so you don't want to control yourself

3842.0 --> 3856.629
then you pay the price

3852.78 --> 3856.6290000000004
[Music]

3864.839 --> 3867.839
ugh

3882.079 --> 3886.0
does that answer your question zack

3892.48 --> 3897.2
not a chant my logical explanation

3895.52 --> 3899.52
well it's not really a logical

3897.2 --> 3901.9199999999996
explanation

3899.52 --> 3903.28
this is esoterics you're just talking

3901.92 --> 3905.839
about

3903.28 --> 3907.2000000000003
frequencies basically right there's

3905.839 --> 3909.2
there is something to

3907.2 --> 3910.799
the trinity it's just that when you're

3909.2 --> 3914.24
going to chant it like

3910.799 --> 3917.0389999999998
it's all literal that's when it stops

3914.24 --> 3917.0389999999998
making any damn

3920.839 --> 3923.839
sense

3923.92 --> 3926.16
right

3927.039 --> 3931.8390000000004
spirit in the sun yeah that that that

3929.359 --> 3935.2799999999997
has an esoteric meaning to it

3931.839 --> 3939.119
has absolutely nothing to do with

3935.28 --> 3942.6400000000003
physical reality though

3939.119 --> 3951.839
it's all about the spirit

3942.64 --> 3951.839
metaphysics exactly

3963.2 --> 3966.799
it turn that filter up

3968.319 --> 3971.52
finally pissed off

3976.839 --> 3979.839
see

3989.92 --> 3995.119
and back to full background noise all

3992.88 --> 3995.119
right

4002.079 --> 4007.3590000000004
witches are [ __ ] what

4006.0 --> 4010.72
i don't think that's really an

4007.359 --> 4010.72
appropriate thing to say

4011.28 --> 4016.4
in response to that feminism is [ __ ]

4015.68 --> 4020.0789999999997
yeah it is

4016.4 --> 4023.359
it absolutely is it's an

4020.079 --> 4027.039
it's a social invention

4023.359 --> 4030.96
specifically designed to destabilize

4027.039 --> 4034.4
and derail society yeah

4030.96 --> 4036.799
does it mean i don't love women

4034.4 --> 4039.119
i'm not a feminist because i do love

4036.799 --> 4039.119
women

4046.4 --> 4052.559
all right but yeah once that feminism

4049.44 --> 4054.88
flame catches the spirit of some women

4052.559 --> 4057.28
they can't let it go and they'll hang on

4054.88 --> 4058.079
to it desperately for the rest of their

4057.28 --> 4061.44
life

4058.079 --> 4064.6400000000003
seeking out isolation for it

4061.44 --> 4068.16
they will they do

4064.64 --> 4070.8799999999997
yeah so anytime somebody does that [ __ ]

4068.16 --> 4072.0789999999997
and they're a woman and you know some of

4070.88 --> 4075.6800000000003
them

4072.079 --> 4078.96
you know exactly what their life is like

4075.68 --> 4091.839
yeah and that's not

4078.96 --> 4091.839
sexist that's the truth

4108.799 --> 4112.08
that doesn't make any sense clutch bear

4111.279 --> 4119.839000000001
no they're not

4112.08 --> 4119.839
equal they aren't

4125.839 --> 4132.239
that makes very little sense but

4129.359 --> 4132.799
yeah no they're just not equal men and

4132.239 --> 4135.919999999999
women

4132.799 --> 4138.48
are not equal yeah they're not

4135.92 --> 4138.96
equal they are not equal they are not

4138.48 --> 4142.48
equal

4138.96 --> 4142.4800000000005
they are not equal

4142.64 --> 4146.719
right that's not a suggestion one is

4144.719 --> 4150.4
above the other or one has

4146.719 --> 4153.679
authority over the other they are

4150.4 --> 4155.599999999999
different though right

4153.679 --> 4156.96
and however you're gonna deal with that

4155.6 --> 4161.679
difference

4156.96 --> 4164.2390000000005
that's up to society the individual

4161.679 --> 4164.2390000000005
a group

4164.719 --> 4177.6
they are different though

4175.12 --> 4179.759
should be treated are you kidding me are

4177.6 --> 4182.2390000000005
you telling me that you should treat a

4179.759 --> 4184.159
man equal to a woman and a woman equal

4182.239 --> 4189.839
to a man

4184.159 --> 4189.839
that's ridiculous

4191.92 --> 4203.84
like just think about that socially that

4195.04 --> 4203.84
doesn't work

4206.719 --> 4212.4
no they don't sometimes need a firm hand

4209.199 --> 4216.4
that's ridiculous but they do need to be

4212.4 --> 4217.12
contained though when a woman goes out

4216.4 --> 4221.04
of control

4217.12 --> 4221.04
you need to point it out

4222.0 --> 4226.0
right and when a man goes out of control

4224.32 --> 4228.639999999999
the same thing yeah it's not like

4226.0 --> 4231.84
that's unique to women men can get out

4228.64 --> 4231.84
of control too

4232.56 --> 4236.56
right thing is though it's in my

4235.84 --> 4238.2390000000005
experience

4236.56 --> 4240.4800000000005
on average when a man goes out of

4238.239 --> 4243.599999999999
control if it doesn't lead to

4240.48 --> 4245.5199999999995
bloodshed which on average happens

4243.6 --> 4249.04
more i think i'm not sure though i don't

4245.52 --> 4252.8
know half i don't have the statistics

4249.04 --> 4255.199
but in my experience and that's just

4252.8 --> 4255.92
my experience right and that's say a

4255.199 --> 4259.5199999999995
hundred

4255.92 --> 4264.0
maybe 200 people in total

4259.52 --> 4265.92
with that sort of thing men are easily

4264.0 --> 4267.679
are more easy to regain their

4265.92 --> 4271.04
sensibility

4267.679 --> 4272.32
after a rage than a woman that's my

4271.04 --> 4276.8
experience

4272.32 --> 4280.239
it's just an average difference

4276.8 --> 4282.8
like women freaking hold grudges

4280.239 --> 4284.48
more land men do much more because when

4282.8 --> 4289.28
men hold grudges

4284.48 --> 4289.28
people tend to like avoid them much more

4293.679 --> 4298.2390000000005
i expect from women there's sayings with

4297.84 --> 4300.64
it

4298.239 --> 4301.36
oh by the way thank you james mays for

4300.64 --> 4304.400000000001
the 40

4301.36 --> 4315.839999999999
super chat donation

4304.4 --> 4315.839999999999
thank you very much i appreciate that

4319.199 --> 4324.159
yeah that's right good clutch bear good

4321.04 --> 4324.159
servant is a great guy

4325.44 --> 4329.839999999999
but he needs to get a grip on his

4327.12 --> 4329.84
chanting

4348.96 --> 4353.12
what a real friend zach he is still a

4352.08 --> 4356.4
real friend

4353.12 --> 4358.719
he is a friend and he he does

4356.4 --> 4361.599999999999
actually almost kiss my ass so you're

4358.719 --> 4361.6
wrong about that

4362.96 --> 4367.679
i actually had to tell him privately

4365.92 --> 4369.36
like could you tone it down a little

4367.679 --> 4371.6
this is getting embarrassing

4369.36 --> 4373.839999999999
because he has so you're wrong about

4371.6 --> 4373.84
that

4375.04 --> 4379.5199999999995
but he does definitely care about me i

4377.44 --> 4382.639999999999
know he does

4379.52 --> 4386.2390000000005
and i care about him but

4382.64 --> 4386.64
that care does not mean that i will not

4386.239 --> 4399.839999999999
be

4386.64 --> 4399.84
critical of bad behavior when i see it

4420.96 --> 4427.84
okay getting this i don't know what to

4422.719 --> 4427.84
say about that right now

4466.08 --> 4469.84
finally some peace and quiet

4489.12 --> 4492.719
right clutch bear yeah that's

4494.84 --> 4500.400000000001
sure that's a way of arranging it

4497.36 --> 4504.0
it's kind of bitter though to start now

4500.4 --> 4507.199
rolling that out after people that are

4504.0 --> 4509.6
obviously highly allergic to it just got

4507.199 --> 4511.678999999999
banned right so it's kind of a bit of a

4509.6 --> 4514.320000000001
dick move to start saying that sort of

4511.679 --> 4516.159
[ __ ] right now

4514.32 --> 4518.719
just saying clutch bear have you thought

4516.159 --> 4518.719
about that

4520.08 --> 4523.679
right i'm not disagreeing with what

4522.8 --> 4525.679
you're saying

4523.679 --> 4527.04
just saying it's kind of a dick move to

4525.679 --> 4530.8
say that sort of thing now

4527.04 --> 4539.84
after opponents

4530.8 --> 4539.84
of it have been banned

4548.88 --> 4555.84
we are when we are

4552.32 --> 4559.04
we are in alignment purpose

4555.84 --> 4562.159000000001
the design and our good

4559.04 --> 4562.159
good now

4562.239 --> 4567.839999999999
now it's all about purpose

4568.56 --> 4576.56
good is it is a word for the spectrum

4572.32 --> 4578.799999999999
for where on the spectrum good and evil

4576.56 --> 4583.04
it's it's the direction you're taking

4578.8 --> 4583.04
within the structure of reality

4591.6 --> 4598.2390000000005
clutch bear yeah it is it's not very

4595.28 --> 4598.239
considerate of you

4601.36 --> 4605.599999999999
like unless you just forgot that

4606.8 --> 4614.320000000001
what is it yeah

4610.88 --> 4615.679
20 minutes ago you know maybe maybe you

4614.32 --> 4617.5199999999995
forgot the time

4615.679 --> 4623.84
20 minutes ago there was an argument

4617.52 --> 4623.84
about this

4630.96 --> 4634.159
loving jesus and the bible bad behavior

4633.679 --> 4636.159
well

4634.159 --> 4638.879999999999
why don't you stop straw manning me with

4636.159 --> 4651.839999999999
such a ridiculous statement zack

4638.88 --> 4651.84
you're straw manning me now

4654.64 --> 4659.04
yeah maybe you don't understand because

4656.8 --> 4661.360000000001
the thing you are strawbanding me with

4659.04 --> 4663.84
makes no freaking sense

4661.36 --> 4679.839999999999
it's very sloppily put together and

4663.84 --> 4679.84
assumed by you for some reason

4682.62 --> 4685.79
[Music]

4689.38 --> 4707.84
[Music]

4692.4 --> 4707.839999999999
all right i'll be back in two minutes

4718.84 --> 4721.84
so

4760.84 --> 4763.84
so

4788.84 --> 4791.84
foreign

4802.84 --> 4805.84
so

4816.84 --> 4819.84
so

4844.84 --> 4861.84
yo uh

4869.44 --> 4875.839999999999
yeah the liver that's right

4881.679 --> 4887.36
wow that's a switch how old is flying

4885.6 --> 4891.280000000001
sourcing technology oh which

4887.36 --> 4893.92
which one exactly could you point me at

4891.28 --> 4893.92
the patent

4896.719 --> 4903.84
no zack no

4900.0 --> 4903.84
jesus did not pray to himself

4906.8 --> 4911.52
are you gonna chant again are you gonna

4909.04 --> 4914.4
do the same thing as tom parker

4911.52 --> 4918.56
are you gonna recite the chant that

4914.4 --> 4918.5599999999995
makes no logical consistent sense

4919.679 --> 4926.56
that insists that god broke

4923.44 --> 4930.879999999999
the laws for man himself

4926.56 --> 4935.92
in order to change everything

4930.88 --> 4938.719
and supposedly permit everybody to sin

4935.92 --> 4941.12
because of it it's the most ridiculous

4938.719 --> 4943.92
chant i've ever heard i can't believe

4941.12 --> 4945.599999999999
this thing has persisted for so long i

4943.92 --> 4948.2390000000005
can't believe that humans can

4945.6 --> 4950.88
fall for that for generations i can't

4948.239 --> 4950.879999999999
believe it

4957.44 --> 4961.36
70 years okay well yeah you can say that

4960.0 --> 4973.84
tara 306 but

4961.36 --> 4973.839999999999
you don't have any proof for that

4982.88 --> 4987.84
a very eloquent description

4992.719 --> 4998.08
all right yeah the the the mahabharata

4996.32 --> 5000.4
or the what is it dude

4998.08 --> 5001.199
yeah the the flying craft i've seen that

5000.4 --> 5004.48
picture

5001.199 --> 5008.4
right it's like

5004.48 --> 5011.5199999999995
this big thing and like very typically

5008.4 --> 5014.159
indian depicted type figure sitting in

5011.52 --> 5015.679
there with his back to the bottom right

5014.159 --> 5020.5599999999995
like he's going to be launched yes i

5015.679 --> 5020.56
remember that's very very old terra 306

5020.639 --> 5024.0
filmanas right

5024.56 --> 5029.84
makbara or what was it called those

5027.28 --> 5029.84
things

5056.88 --> 5060.96
yeah well zach concerning uh your remark

5060.56 --> 5063.280000000001
about

5060.96 --> 5065.679
india has things to connect to your

5063.28 --> 5069.36
spirituality that wrought your spirit

5065.679 --> 5072.2390000000005
oh yeah yeah but

5069.36 --> 5073.36
i mean like other countries they don't

5072.239 --> 5077.04
do that

5073.36 --> 5079.36
oh really

5077.04 --> 5080.4
so there's been no activities

5079.36 --> 5084.639
historically

5080.4 --> 5088.08
in the last few thousand years in europe

5084.639 --> 5091.6
and the united states where religious

5088.08 --> 5092.0
actors were not rotting people spirit oh

5091.6 --> 5095.52
wait

5092.0 --> 5097.6
where are we at right now oh ah all that

5095.52 --> 5101.120000000001
all the churches what they do oh no

5097.6 --> 5103.360000000001
we are not right our religion is good

5101.12 --> 5104.4
we're not rotting our people's spirit

5103.36 --> 5107.839999999999
with that at all

5104.4 --> 5110.638999999999
no it's the indians indians are bad

5107.84 --> 5111.6
there's spirituality it rots people even

5110.639 --> 5115.04
though it's

5111.6 --> 5116.4800000000005
been there the longest and it's still

5115.04 --> 5120.0
pretty stable

5116.48 --> 5127.839999999999
right unlike another group

5120.0 --> 5127.84
out here

5141.199 --> 5144.719
i mean i'm not saying that everything

5142.96 --> 5147.84
that is taught there

5144.719 --> 5150.719
especially by the priesthoods

5147.84 --> 5152.88
that it's good i'm not saying that at

5150.719 --> 5152.88
all

5153.44 --> 5160.719
right because they're still priests

5157.04 --> 5163.5199999999995
and priests will always try to use

5160.719 --> 5164.08
teachings and writings and the trust of

5163.52 --> 5167.1990000000005
people

5164.08 --> 5169.28
to make them do things that contrast the

5167.199 --> 5171.28
teachings

5169.28 --> 5172.48
always end up doing it because

5171.28 --> 5176.5599999999995
priesthood as

5172.48 --> 5180.239
christ warned is all about power

5176.56 --> 5182.56
power over mind that's what it's really

5180.239 --> 5184.4
about that's why he was against it

5182.56 --> 5186.4800000000005
that's why he was against that sort of

5184.4 --> 5189.28
thing because it always happens

5186.48 --> 5191.678999999999
it doesn't matter what the scripture is

5189.28 --> 5193.44
it doesn't matter who wrote it

5191.679 --> 5194.8
it doesn't even matter how much wisdom

5193.44 --> 5197.678999999999
it contains right

5194.8 --> 5199.1990000000005
the bible contains the wisdom that warns

5197.679 --> 5202.639
about priesthoods

5199.199 --> 5206.239
guess what who's in control of it

5202.639 --> 5208.96
priesthoods yeah

5206.239 --> 5210.879999999999
so who's to say that other religions are

5208.96 --> 5225.84
not subjected to the same

5210.88 --> 5225.84
issues they all are

5236.84 --> 5239.84
what

5242.4 --> 5247.839999999999
i don't understand what you just said

5244.239 --> 5253.839999999999
there gaining wisdom that's weird

5247.84 --> 5253.84
lord of marines what what

5277.3 --> 5280.570000000001
[Music]

5278.84 --> 5283.62
loud

5280.57 --> 5283.62
[Music]

5288.639 --> 5295.84
great time for a weed worker

5306.84 --> 5309.84
uh

5330.28 --> 5333.46
[Music]

5334.84 --> 5337.84
hmm

5340.159 --> 5346.08
mercury how does that work

5343.52 --> 5348.400000000001
i mean is it even mechanically described

5346.08 --> 5350.08
what happens inside this view is it like

5348.4 --> 5351.44
mechanically described what those

5350.08 --> 5354.32
vehicles are like

5351.44 --> 5356.96
i've only ever seen the drawings of it

5354.32 --> 5361.5199999999995
are you saying there's actual

5356.96 --> 5364.96
like alchemical instructions

5361.52 --> 5379.84
that come with it

5364.96 --> 5379.84
tear it 306 i've never heard of that

5380.56 --> 5384.159000000001
the guy with the little mustache

5389.52 --> 5393.040000000001
all right all right it is interesting

5391.28 --> 5397.199
though like

5393.04 --> 5399.6
back in my ufo tracing days before

5397.199 --> 5400.5599999999995
well before creationism even before flat

5399.6 --> 5402.88
earth

5400.56 --> 5405.04
i was kind of into ufos for a while for

5402.88 --> 5408.2390000000005
a while because of my first girlfriend

5405.04 --> 5410.08
was a lot into it like literally

5408.239 --> 5412.239
looking through the looking glass at

5410.08 --> 5414.96
night hoping to catch a ufo like

5412.239 --> 5415.678999999999
every day serious that was my first

5414.96 --> 5418.84
girlfriend

5415.679 --> 5420.719
so i got into it too and yeah i remember

5418.84 --> 5424.159000000001
like

5420.719 --> 5428.0
the picture i saw of that vehicle

5424.159 --> 5431.92
fascinating i actually saw that on

5428.0 --> 5435.36
a ufo magazine cover one time

5431.92 --> 5437.84
or somewhere in there it's really

5435.36 --> 5440.08
fascinating

5437.84 --> 5449.84
the picture should be easily accessible

5440.08 --> 5449.84
now on the internet

5450.719 --> 5455.659
script you are

5452.5 --> 5455.659
[Music]

5456.08 --> 5459.36
i don't think that would work the same

5458.0 --> 5463.84
way in the uh

5459.36 --> 5463.839999999999
original greek translation tara 306

5466.08 --> 5477.84
i think that's a little bit cliche level

5478.3 --> 5481.439
[Music]

5491.04 --> 5495.44
this is actually oh wait uh whatever

5492.96 --> 5497.6
tells us rata zala said

5495.44 --> 5497.599999999999
wait

5499.199 --> 5502.48
what are you talking about clutch bear

5500.719 --> 5504.4800000000005
i'm getting a little lost i

5502.48 --> 5506.32
appreciate all of your input i find it

5504.48 --> 5508.799999999999
very interesting what you're all writing

5506.32 --> 5508.799999999999
right now

5514.32 --> 5520.5599999999995
right ufos back in 2015-16 well for me

5520.88 --> 5529.679
it was 1998

5526.239 --> 5533.599999999999
to not 2000 pretty much

5529.679 --> 5537.1990000000005
not beyond 2000.

5533.6 --> 5540.2390000000005
into 2002 and then

5537.199 --> 5540.638999999999
everything changed around 9 11 happened

5540.239 --> 5544.48
i

5540.639 --> 5546.159000000001
kind of slipped

5544.48 --> 5547.599999999999
into the gothic scene and that

5546.159 --> 5551.04
completely

5547.6 --> 5552.719
changed my view on ufos too so when i

5551.04 --> 5555.5199999999995
first started to think that

5552.719 --> 5557.44
that's not real it's probably demons and

5555.52 --> 5561.280000000001
then it was before i knew about flat

5557.44 --> 5565.04
earth so

5561.28 --> 5575.84
all right it's all

5565.04 --> 5575.84
like 20 years ago

5608.08 --> 5612.96
okay what are you saying getting wisdom

5610.96 --> 5617.76
jesus wrote into jerusalem on an

5612.96 --> 5621.04
ass i've heard of that about that

5617.76 --> 5631.84
as a king get it well

5621.04 --> 5631.84
i'm sorry am i overlooking something

5641.12 --> 5645.12
college prayer i think they're

5642.84 --> 5647.28
interdimensional yeah well there is

5645.12 --> 5649.12
probably an inter-dimensional element to

5647.28 --> 5652.48
them at least

5649.12 --> 5656.0
except yeah to claim they are the

5652.48 --> 5659.839999999999
fallen that's a little much though right

5656.0 --> 5659.84
i think it's more likely they are

5660.239 --> 5666.239
like lost disconnected from

5663.44 --> 5669.28
reincarnation dwelling spirits

5666.239 --> 5670.879999999999
right maybe they were once you

5669.28 --> 5672.32
yeah it's kind of almost like an orc

5670.88 --> 5675.4400000000005
story maybe they were once

5672.32 --> 5678.159
humans then they altered themselves and

5675.44 --> 5679.759999999999
their own spirit in a way

5678.159 --> 5681.199
and it could have been pretty recent

5679.76 --> 5683.04
right who knows

5681.199 --> 5684.879999999999
it doesn't have to be like in super

5683.04 --> 5686.0
ancient times before the flood although

5684.88 --> 5689.04
that probably happened

5686.0 --> 5691.36
back then as well but it might have been

5689.04 --> 5694.239
happening even earlier

5691.36 --> 5697.36
and they're just lost spirits that

5694.239 --> 5699.44
cannot reconnect again so when they die

5697.36 --> 5701.92
they get completely disconnected in the

5699.44 --> 5705.199
other dimension and then they just

5701.92 --> 5706.88
are left to dwell there and work with

5705.199 --> 5708.08
the spirit mechanics of the other

5706.88 --> 5712.84
dimension

5708.08 --> 5714.239
and that's it did some bible support

5712.84 --> 5717.52
reincarnation

5714.239 --> 5720.959999999999
i'm not sure tara 306 it's a difficult

5717.52 --> 5720.96
it's difficult i i think

5723.04 --> 5727.44
well i personally do think there's

5725.52 --> 5728.2390000000005
something to reincarnation it's just

5727.44 --> 5730.5599999999995
like

5728.239 --> 5730.5599999999995
how

5731.36 --> 5743.839999999999
i'm not sure

5749.199 --> 5754.159
right but if you think about that that

5752.08 --> 5756.639
there could be such a thing

5754.159 --> 5758.239
then yeah if you let's just say there

5756.639 --> 5761.76
was such a thing as reincarnation let's

5758.239 --> 5761.759999999999
presuppose for a moment right

5762.639 --> 5768.32
you get born you do what you're set out

5766.0 --> 5773.76
to do in your life

5768.32 --> 5776.88
in conjunction with god before you start

5773.76 --> 5778.2390000000005
you do your challenges and then maybe

5776.88 --> 5782.56
somewhere mid-life you

5778.239 --> 5784.48
so disconnect you so alter everything

5782.56 --> 5785.92
that it's not just okay you're going to

5784.48 --> 5789.5199999999995
hell or something

5785.92 --> 5789.52
but that you literally just

5789.84 --> 5793.76
like you're not even connected with the

5791.52 --> 5795.679
human cycle anymore

5793.76 --> 5797.76
then maybe you could drop out of

5795.679 --> 5800.8
reincarnation

5797.76 --> 5803.360000000001
and then just instead of reincarnating

5800.8 --> 5807.360000000001
there's nothing to reincarnate for you

5803.36 --> 5810.839999999999
and you just dwell pointlessly

5807.36 --> 5813.839999999999
disconnected from the original spirit

5810.84 --> 5813.84
line

5814.159 --> 5818.239
right but this is yeah

5818.28 --> 5827.84
presuppositional it is yeah i don't know

5831.84 --> 5841.84
go to the go to demigod

5835.36 --> 5841.839999999999
what are you talking about

5844.159 --> 5849.759999999999
damn i got what the where did that come

5852.84 --> 5855.84
from

5863.92 --> 5870.96
right but we're all wandering now away

5866.32 --> 5870.96
from biblical things now a lot so

5871.92 --> 5876.159
this is turning onto wild speculation

5880.84 --> 5883.84
right

5889.84 --> 5894.8
just guessing it's it's it's quite a

5892.8 --> 5897.04
wild guess especially since

5894.8 --> 5899.28
within your guest you just conjured an

5897.04 --> 5901.36
entire realm with a couple of words with

5899.28 --> 5904.4
wild implications out of nowhere

5901.36 --> 5911.839999999999
without explanation so yeah just

5904.4 --> 5911.839999999999
guessing yeah

5936.84 --> 5942.32
hmm

5939.679 --> 5943.04
well that's a good question tiny one

5942.32 --> 5946.96
wasn't the

5943.04 --> 5948.56
ass donkey

5946.96 --> 5950.88
a common form of transportation back

5948.56 --> 5952.320000000001
then yes it was especially in the drier

5950.88 --> 5954.08
areas

5952.32 --> 5957.28
because they're very durable and they

5954.08 --> 5957.28
can carry a lot

5958.88 --> 5965.4400000000005
donkeys asses last a long time much

5962.48 --> 5966.159
much longer than horses horses are

5965.44 --> 5969.678999999999
really more

5966.159 --> 5971.599999999999
for the grassland

5969.679 --> 5974.32
type of regions where there's enough

5971.6 --> 5976.320000000001
moist or rivers around

5974.32 --> 5977.679
for them to be able to just live in the

5976.32 --> 5980.639
wild right

5977.679 --> 5981.4400000000005
well asses are much tougher and they can

5980.639 --> 5984.159000000001
really

5981.44 --> 5986.08
deal with the drier areas and

5984.159 --> 5988.719
mountainous areas much better than

5986.08 --> 5992.08
horses can

5988.719 --> 5995.84
so it would have been regional whereas

5992.08 --> 5995.84
asses are common transport

6020.84 --> 6023.84
ah

6044.159 --> 6048.239
okay gaining wisdom you're done now yeah

6048.84 --> 6051.84
i

6052.96 --> 6057.04
what is this breaking of the circle of

6055.04 --> 6065.84
life and death you're talking about

6057.04 --> 6065.84
i don't know what that is

6078.66 --> 6081.87
[Music]

6090.84 --> 6093.84
do

6095.04 --> 6098.639
because you want to believe that tiny

6097.28 --> 6100.88
womble

6098.639 --> 6102.96
what you actually understand what he's

6100.88 --> 6105.04
talking about

6102.96 --> 6108.0
why would you suggest that he said that

6105.04 --> 6121.84
because he wanted to believe that

6108.0 --> 6121.84
what do you understand what he said

6131.119 --> 6135.44
okay okay clutch bear well if there's

6133.119 --> 6138.239
like a prophecy

6135.44 --> 6140.239
involved the prediction on to the future

6138.239 --> 6142.08
of how we would arrive and it wasn't as

6140.239 --> 6144.5599999999995
yeah okay well that's prophecy

6142.08 --> 6144.5599999999995
i guess

6146.84 --> 6149.84
sure

6168.8 --> 6173.76
what the hell are you talking about lynn

6170.8 --> 6175.4400000000005
marlott the leafs

6173.76 --> 6177.6
the hell is wrong with you we're not

6175.44 --> 6180.719
talking about beliefs

6177.6 --> 6184.0
talking about mechanics here

6180.719 --> 6184.0
things that happen

6184.4 --> 6188.719
or how things could happen we're not

6186.4 --> 6191.119
dealing with beliefs

6188.719 --> 6194.719
or maybe gaining wisdom was for a moment

6191.119 --> 6194.719
since he kind of declared that

6197.199 --> 6204.839999999999
right but hey if you want to believe

6201.92 --> 6206.1990000000005
as an atheist and there's no

6204.84 --> 6210.32
consequences

6206.199 --> 6212.48
whatsoever after death

6210.32 --> 6213.599999999999
in the face of everything you do in your

6212.48 --> 6216.959999999999
life

6213.6 --> 6219.84
then you can believe that

6216.96 --> 6219.84
go ahead

6220.48 --> 6223.5199999999995
we'll see what happens

6229.679 --> 6235.1990000000005
you thought it was a religious debate

6232.32 --> 6235.199
what religion

6238.56 --> 6241.6
what are you talking about

6242.239 --> 6248.159
i mean this show has been going now for

6246.08 --> 6249.36
this specific discussion has been going

6248.159 --> 6252.4
for over one and a half

6249.36 --> 6252.4
hours i don't

6253.92 --> 6260.56
really see what you're talking about all

6257.119 --> 6262.799999999999
religions oh oh you know what they are

6260.56 --> 6262.8
then

6266.639 --> 6270.96
i'm not getting a sense from you lynne

6268.48 --> 6273.119
murlot that you actually have some

6270.96 --> 6274.0
valid input on this or that you even

6273.119 --> 6277.36
know on what

6274.0 --> 6280.48
level we're having a discussion here

6277.36 --> 6282.08
right things have been said things have

6280.48 --> 6289.839999999999
preceded this

6282.08 --> 6289.84
part of the conversation

6300.84 --> 6303.84
so

6311.92 --> 6316.2390000000005
well agm yeah that could be man i'm

6314.4 --> 6317.759999999999
assuming there will be judgment after

6316.239 --> 6323.199
death

6317.76 --> 6327.04
but there's another thing though

6323.199 --> 6330.638999999999
there's also judgment before

6327.04 --> 6333.679
death yeah the judgment comes

6330.639 --> 6333.679
through the world

6333.84 --> 6337.92
you know why because that's how the

6336.56 --> 6341.6
mechanics of this

6337.92 --> 6345.76
world work when you sin

6341.6 --> 6349.1990000000005
you pay the price not after death

6345.76 --> 6352.719
before in your life when you sin

6349.199 --> 6355.919999999999
your sin changes the way your life

6352.719 --> 6358.96
unrolls you might not see it

6355.92 --> 6362.2390000000005
you might spend your entire life

6358.96 --> 6363.679
building a convincing case on denying

6362.239 --> 6366.0
that it is true

6363.679 --> 6367.679
yeah you can spend your entire life on

6366.0 --> 6370.88
that denying it

6367.679 --> 6373.84
it's still true so whether we are judged

6370.88 --> 6375.76
after we die and i do expect that to

6373.84 --> 6379.119000000001
happen in some way

6375.76 --> 6382.320000000001
right that's my belief it is a belief

6379.119 --> 6383.44
i have no absolute evidence for it it is

6382.32 --> 6387.84
my belief it is

6383.44 --> 6387.839999999999
something on which i rest my case

6388.32 --> 6395.679
but i know for a fact

6392.0 --> 6398.84
the world judges you the spirit

6395.679 --> 6402.32
of people and the very fabric of

6398.84 --> 6406.0
creation judges you through

6402.32 --> 6410.48
your development you will be judged

6406.0 --> 6412.639
in life in life

6410.48 --> 6414.08
not after it's not like oh it's a free

6412.639 --> 6416.88
throw you could do whatever the [ __ ]

6414.08 --> 6419.28
you want no consequences whatsoever you

6416.88 --> 6421.36
won't even notice there's consequences

6419.28 --> 6425.36
no it all comes after death

6421.36 --> 6429.759999999999
no no no no no no

6425.36 --> 6433.679
we can all see and feel

6429.76 --> 6437.119000000001
that people violating the rules

6433.679 --> 6440.159
get judged we can feel it of them

6437.119 --> 6444.88
they are judged in life

6440.159 --> 6444.879999999999
you feel it it's right there

6449.84 --> 6453.360000000001
what is the judgment for after death i

6452.0 --> 6458.639
don't know

6453.36 --> 6458.639
i don't know lin marlitt i don't know

6458.96 --> 6463.44
i guess it well we can philosophize

6461.52 --> 6467.84
about that i don't know though

6463.44 --> 6467.839999999999
right we can say well maybe

6468.719 --> 6474.8
it's about the continuing path into the

6472.08 --> 6476.8
other dimensionally life beyond

6474.8 --> 6478.400000000001
right what could be considered like

6476.8 --> 6480.56
heaven or hell

6478.4 --> 6482.799999999999
wherever it's gonna go the continuity

6480.56 --> 6486.88
the presumed continuation

6482.8 --> 6488.88
of life after death how it will proceed

6486.88 --> 6491.119
it's not strange if you're gonna

6488.88 --> 6493.28
presuppose that

6491.119 --> 6495.599999999999
that there would be some kind of

6493.28 --> 6497.28
judgment process in order to determine

6495.6 --> 6500.320000000001
where you will go

6497.28 --> 6503.92
right but i know

6500.32 --> 6507.28
i don't have to presuppose i know for a

6503.92 --> 6511.679
fact that we are judged

6507.28 --> 6514.88
as we live in life

6511.679 --> 6517.679
palpably measurably

6514.88 --> 6518.88
you can't avoid it you'd have to be

6517.679 --> 6523.84
blind

6518.88 --> 6523.84
to deny it because it's right there

6524.84 --> 6527.84
palpably

6535.44 --> 6538.96
no not no not criminal courts i'm not

6538.08 --> 6542.96
talking about

6538.96 --> 6546.32
the law of man

6542.96 --> 6550.08
i'm talking about a law of god

6546.32 --> 6550.08
for man right

6552.48 --> 6560.32
the law that is not written and

6555.599 --> 6563.28
alterable on a piece of paper the law

6560.32 --> 6564.48
assumed to be set in stone but more

6563.28 --> 6567.119
important than that

6564.48 --> 6569.04
i think that the setting in stone that

6567.119 --> 6572.4
that even is symbolic in a way

6569.04 --> 6575.84
probably because i think that the laws

6572.4 --> 6579.119
for men are literally etched into

6575.84 --> 6583.4400000000005
every single piece of energy and atom

6579.119 --> 6586.4
in creation it is the law

6583.44 --> 6588.08
not because it's written it's because it

6586.4 --> 6596.0
is

6588.08 --> 6599.36
that's what i think

6596.0 --> 6602.239
the very fabric of reality

6599.36 --> 6603.5199999999995
and the logical consistency and

6602.239 --> 6611.119
consequences of

6603.52 --> 6613.4400000000005
things are the proof

6611.119 --> 6613.44
ah

6617.04 --> 6625.84
yeah agm you don't even know what that

6619.04 --> 6625.84
means buddy

6627.119 --> 6634.639
to fulfill the law that what no

6630.8 --> 6638.639
he cannot fulfill the law

6634.639 --> 6640.400000000001
only for himself

6638.639 --> 6642.56
but you're right about him not changing

6640.4 --> 6646.0
it which by the way that statement

6642.56 --> 6648.400000000001
completely undoes everything you say

6646.0 --> 6650.56
about his death okay everything that

6648.4 --> 6653.119
everybody's chanting about his death

6650.56 --> 6653.84
how it's so critical for everything what

6653.119 --> 6657.04
you just

6653.84 --> 6659.599
said directly contradicts that chant

6657.04 --> 6661.44
just saying just telling you agm just so

6659.599 --> 6664.159000000001
you know

6661.44 --> 6664.96
just so you know that that logically

6664.159 --> 6667.44
counters

6664.96 --> 6669.119
the statement of the chant that his

6667.44 --> 6672.4
death means everything

6669.119 --> 6676.48
that that changed it yeah it says you

6672.4 --> 6679.598999999999
say others say his death changed

6676.48 --> 6685.759999999999
it now you're saying it fulfills it

6679.599 --> 6685.76
oh really so there is no change then

6692.84 --> 6697.76
so i mean

6695.679 --> 6700.4800000000005
you can do just whatever the [ __ ] you

6697.76 --> 6703.1990000000005
want because jesus already died

6700.48 --> 6704.32
for the sin you are about to commit and

6703.199 --> 6707.44
you know it and you

6704.32 --> 6710.5599999999995
revel in it so happy with christ

6707.44 --> 6711.759999999999
so happy that he was slaughtered just so

6710.56 --> 6713.84
you could

6711.76 --> 6715.679
do whatever the [ __ ] you like against

6713.84 --> 6719.4400000000005
god's will at the moment

6715.679 --> 6723.119
right because it's okay because he died

6719.44 --> 6727.119
to pay for your sin that you commit

6723.119 --> 6727.119
right now and that's what you believe

6734.84 --> 6737.84
really

6747.28 --> 6752.719
yeah i'm running out the show this is

6750.639 --> 6755.28
never gonna end anyway

6752.719 --> 6757.36
so i'm sure i'm gonna see most of you

6755.28 --> 6757.599
back tomorrow and we'll continue this

6757.36 --> 6760.88
and

6757.599 --> 6763.52
agm will keep on chanting until he gets

6760.88 --> 6766.0
all riled up and gets himself banned

6763.52 --> 6767.84
just like tom parker did just like here

6766.0 --> 6769.04
we go again did although for another

6767.84 --> 6771.92
reason with her

6769.04 --> 6773.199
right so yeah i expect maybe good serve

6771.92 --> 6777.119
maybe you should all

6773.199 --> 6779.199
band together and just

6777.119 --> 6780.88
say maybe we should just make videos

6779.199 --> 6784.32
about arwen and how he

6780.88 --> 6787.1990000000005
is the antichrist because he undermines

6784.32 --> 6788.159
your foundational chant beliefs about

6787.199 --> 6790.08
jesus

6788.159 --> 6792.08
yeah maybe you should start making

6790.08 --> 6795.119
videos maybe make a special

6792.08 --> 6797.76
cult about it just say

6795.119 --> 6798.5599999999995
no we are the christians because we

6797.76 --> 6801.679
chant

6798.56 --> 6804.56
[ __ ] that makes no freaking sense

6801.679 --> 6807.04
has no logical consistency to it and

6804.56 --> 6811.04
contradicts jesus's teachings

6807.04 --> 6814.239
but we believe it and we will believe

6811.04 --> 6817.04
we get endless rewards for chanting this

6814.239 --> 6818.48
[ __ ] which makes no logical sense

6817.04 --> 6821.84
whatsoever

6818.48 --> 6821.839999999999
maybe you should just do that

6829.76 --> 6835.04
all right anyway thanks everyone for

6832.239 --> 6838.159
coming those that are still around

6835.04 --> 6840.08
in chat if you like this show

6838.159 --> 6841.759999999999
or maybe you didn't really like it but

6840.08 --> 6844.96
maybe you could appreciate

6841.76 --> 6847.119000000001
the attempt of breaking one of the

6844.96 --> 6850.639
biggest

6847.119 --> 6851.199
nonsensical chants that the western

6850.639 --> 6854.2390000000005
world has

6851.199 --> 6856.719
ever known and it echoes on

6854.239 --> 6859.44
for over a millennia maybe you

6856.719 --> 6862.96
appreciate my attempt in this

6859.44 --> 6866.48
right it's very serious and i pay for it

6862.96 --> 6868.639
yeah isolation that's the payment

6866.48 --> 6870.5599999999995
i have to pay with isolation because

6868.639 --> 6873.84
there will be a lot of people

6870.56 --> 6875.280000000001
a lot of people triggered and they will

6873.84 --> 6878.400000000001
hate me for it

6875.28 --> 6882.239
and they will not listen to me anymore

6878.4 --> 6885.04
yeah and that's their price to pay

6882.239 --> 6888.08
that's your price that's your price for

6885.04 --> 6888.08
your ignorance

6893.119 --> 6898.96

christian zealots that love their chance

6929.76 --> 6933.1990000000005
that make no freaking sense to pay me

after this

but i still need to keep going so

6936.56 --> 6943.679
i'm afraid others will have to

6940.0 --> 6945.36
fill in for that or i'll be in trouble

6943.679 --> 6946.719
because i will run into financial

6945.36 --> 6948.88
trouble eventually

6946.719 --> 6949.92
if i don't get continuing support so

6948.88 --> 6953.4400000000005
