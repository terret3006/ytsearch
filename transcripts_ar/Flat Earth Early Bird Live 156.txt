you liked the show

155.099 --> 165.98899999999998
mm-hmm so have I been doing

159.849 --> 170.44
oh yeah I think after the show yesterday

165.989 --> 176.08
ranty went on hoses and I followed in

170.44 --> 181.66
after but yeah I was a bit messy but

176.08 --> 184.18
yeah it was interesting but yeah didn't

181.66 --> 187.03
get super high energy like last time so

184.18 --> 187.69
I don't know it was it was okay other

187.03 --> 193.09
than that

187.69 --> 199.239
lots of hangouts again yeah didn't have

193.09 --> 201.459
time to make a list I don't know

199.239 --> 203.17000000000002
I wasn't even up that late but he got

201.459 --> 206.11
groceries and the weather was just so

203.17 --> 210.30999999999997
nice it just couldn't hurry it up and

206.11 --> 214.14000000000001
just enjoyed the bike ride in nature so

210.31 --> 214.14000000000001
let's see what did I watch yesterday

216.14 --> 222.55999999999997
all right yeah globe busters ozone I

218.33 --> 225.89000000000001
completely missed out totally oh yeah I

222.56 --> 235.94
wouldn't Benjamin of course was very

225.89 --> 240.2
good no that was it the rest just

235.94 --> 243.26
playing games and watching Outlander of

240.2 --> 245.959
course it's really impressive that

243.26 --> 248.89999999999998
series but yeah the longer I'm getting

245.959 --> 251.33
into it the more I noticed that it

248.9 --> 257.709
really is like a romance novel because

251.33 --> 264.1
things happen that are just like either

257.709 --> 268.49
a lossless but punishing test or

264.1 --> 271.46000000000004
incredible convenient coincidence to to

268.49 --> 273.68
help things out and it's arranged in a

271.46 --> 276.40999999999997
way that it's kind of if you really get

273.68 --> 278.54
into the character then it's kind of

276.41 --> 280.82000000000005
believable what but when you look over

278.54 --> 285.28000000000003
look the whole thing yeah you really do

280.82 --> 287.84
notice like oh that was very convenient

285.28 --> 290.45
in a situation where everything looked

287.84 --> 295.34
like it was gonna go to [ __ ] completely

290.45 --> 299.15
and God like the couple they there's so

295.34 --> 301.46
many like pretty soft porn scenes even

299.15 --> 304.31
during the entire series I've noticed

301.46 --> 306.38
like okay again and they like play out

304.31 --> 309.38
the entire scene it it really is a

306.38 --> 312.11
romance novel and sometimes I feel like

309.38 --> 314.45
them I think I might have a little bit

312.11 --> 317.18
too much testosterone in me to enjoy

314.45 --> 320.99
this like properly how it has to be

317.18 --> 323.87
enjoyed I think I think it's more

320.99 --> 330.35
directed women but I still do enjoy it

323.87 --> 332.99
very much in any way that series the

330.35 --> 335.99
actors are absolutely amazing also the

332.99 --> 338.03000000000003
side the side characters I'm really

335.99 --> 341.32
impressed by all the characters that are

338.03 --> 346.63
in that series anyway

341.32 --> 346.63
mmm that or that

358.83 --> 365.229
all right

361.4 --> 373.4
Aaron was sat there like this pickle

365.229 --> 377.06
okay now don't worry I look the series

373.4 --> 379.60999999999996
is is soft-porn --is-- but it is really

377.06 --> 382.79
to just emphasize the romance because

379.61 --> 386.54
and I like this about it is that the

382.79 --> 390.44
characters are not yet they are very

386.54 --> 393.199
passionate but they really do emphasize

390.44 --> 396.02
the love part of it all and talk about

393.199 --> 401.72
that conceptually and I just totally

396.02 --> 404.03
agree with that it's it's more about

401.72 --> 407.03000000000003
love than it is about sex and other

404.03 --> 409.669
characters are also oriented on that

407.03 --> 412.48999999999995
kind of thing but it is kind of looked

409.669 --> 416.27
down upon so it's more about love and

412.49 --> 419.36
passion and and all that I don't know

416.27 --> 423.65
enough about all that stuff but no it's

419.36 --> 429.52000000000004
not it's not really important don't

423.65 --> 429.52
worry I would get kind of sick of it

436.5 --> 441.5
let's see

438.33 --> 441.5
[Music]

443.27 --> 449.78
huh truth is truth says and was warm

447.199 --> 452.09000000000003
yesterday and now they're sleet right

449.78 --> 455.35999999999996
well there was sleet here two days ago

452.09 --> 458.44899999999996
as well was very weird all of a sudden

455.36 --> 460.99
starts snowing and hailing and it kept

458.449 --> 463.639
on going for an hour was very bizarre

460.99 --> 473.09000000000003
but yeah after that's like nothing ever

463.639 --> 476.979
happened so yeah so yeah I've been

473.09 --> 479.56899999999996
watching myself back and it was weird I

476.979 --> 484.789
had a conversation in the background on

479.569 --> 487.13
Skype over I mean about yeah stop words

484.789 --> 490.009
I don't know if it's the exact same

487.13 --> 493.52
terminology as in Dutch as it is in

490.009 --> 496.849
English about stop words and I noticed

493.52 --> 500.35999999999996
that a lot of people have for example

496.849 --> 504.229
the word like they say like a lot or

500.36 --> 509.36
that's a very common thing especially in

504.229 --> 511.969
America but I myself have stopped words

509.36 --> 515.75
as well I've noticed and it's getting

511.969 --> 520.459
really annoying with me it's the word

515.75 --> 522.95
yeah and sometimes I just have these

520.459 --> 526.579
yeah it's it's incredibly annoying

522.95 --> 528.1400000000001
so I'm really now I've noticed this like

526.579 --> 532.25
okay this has gone too far

528.14 --> 536.8389999999999
no more yes for you are we so I'm gonna

532.25 --> 542.51
stop saying yeah that I'm just gonna

536.839 --> 544.75
replace it with nothing I'm gonna try

542.51 --> 544.75
anyway

548.47 --> 554.6800000000001
oh yeah yeah some people do have that

551.38 --> 558.39
you know what I'm saying as well that's

554.68 --> 565.27
even more long-winded stop sentence

558.39 --> 570.16
it's very slang ish in a way I I used to

565.27 --> 577.72
say it as well but that's like decades

570.16 --> 581.4399999999999
back yeah right John Carlos about the

577.72 --> 586.47
c-word it's against Brenda yeah that may

581.44 --> 586.47
look I don't completely understand the

587.01 --> 593.29
the level really of these words in

589.81 --> 597.0699999999999
English I think that maybe the c-word is

593.29 --> 600.43
really brutal apparently to me it's just

597.07 --> 603.22
like calling somebody a dick but on the

600.43 --> 605.62
other sex and basically treating them as

603.22 --> 609.3000000000001
equals that's how I see it I'm very

605.62 --> 612.25
liberal in that sense or maybe it's just

609.3 --> 614.38
what the liberal nation my life has

612.25 --> 616.81
desensitized me in that sense so I just

614.38 --> 620.86
don't get how it's supposed to be taken

616.81 --> 623.02
but yeah I do use that word against

620.86 --> 626.17
women that I just read that really

623.02 --> 630.0699999999999
repulsed me and Brenda which apparently

626.17 --> 633.0699999999999
is a woman yeah she gets really freaking

630.07 --> 635.2
repulsive and then if if somebody like

633.07 --> 641.0500000000001
that push it I'll get pissed off and I

635.2 --> 645.0400000000001
will call them accounts now even use a

641.05 --> 647.3399999999999
Scottish accent I call that my [ __ ] ever

645.04 --> 647.3399999999999
Nate

650.449 --> 655.6189999999999
because it's better when you say it in

652.8 --> 659.699
Scottish but my god yeah very much

655.619 --> 663.8090000000001
deserved although maybe a little bit

659.699 --> 668.449
shocking so sorry to my audience I'll

663.809 --> 668.449
try to use the word more sparingly

674.52 --> 677.6
[Music]

684.01 --> 691.63
[Music]

688.56 --> 695.649
I'm definitely brushing up on my

691.63 --> 701.01
Scottish master thanks there watching

695.649 --> 704.98
that series yeah the main character

701.01 --> 711.8199999999999
speaks a lot of Scottish and the canna

704.98 --> 715.66
rubs off on you and I think it's a very

711.82 --> 718.12
beautiful accent when it's not too slang

715.66 --> 722.67
ish and doesn't use lots of swear words

718.12 --> 722.67
so interesting

730.4 --> 733.2099999999999
hmm

736.9 --> 743.42
yeah it is functional I know but the

740.42 --> 747.2299999999999
thing is I try not to swear in general

743.42 --> 749.78
and on this show also yeah tell others

747.23 --> 752.0600000000001
not to and yeah it's kind of like then

749.78 --> 753.8299999999999
in a certain way like the Nathan policy

752.06 --> 755.81
although Nathan just completely

753.83 --> 764.0
disregards it when he gets pissed off

755.81 --> 768.4
and I don't mean to do that but I yeah

764.0 --> 771.74
end up doing it sometimes anyway and

768.4 --> 773.6899999999999
yeah that's like it's not very our

771.74 --> 776.36
winner I guess or maybe it is according

773.69 --> 780.1
to you guys because I do seem to get

776.36 --> 780.1
very pissed off at times

793.45 --> 801.4000000000001
all right reading the baddest swear

797.53 --> 805.86
words in Australia I don't know I

801.4 --> 807.13
haven't heard a lot of a lot of that

805.86 --> 810.07
yeah

807.13 --> 812.34
don't know any typical Australian swear

810.07 --> 812.34
words

827.95 --> 835.84
ouki are those typical Australian they

833.86 --> 843.33
just seem British to me rainy

835.84 --> 843.33
ah hello the other Brenda

853.25 --> 856.25
okay

864.289 --> 867.289
Hey

876.06 --> 884.0899999999999
ha that's hilarious drunken bullet for

881.7 --> 884.09
one one

900.0 --> 908.279
what now I'm wondering like I recognize

906.089 --> 911.6700000000001
words but I don't exactly always know

908.279 --> 924.0889999999999
what they actually mean like for example

911.67 --> 924.689
the word mongrel does that mean all

924.089 --> 929.1890000000001
right

924.689 --> 931.639
the crossbreed huh wow that is really

929.189 --> 931.639
old

934.2 --> 942.769
yeah I've forgotten right yeah it's okay

938.07 --> 942.769
oh yeah

952.29 --> 970.439
guilty as charged though it's my parents

956.79 --> 971.129
fault can't really open so yeah that's

970.439 --> 978.389
number one

971.129 --> 981.119
I get the link out starting oh hey

978.389 --> 987.139
nathan has a life hangout link so he's

981.119 --> 987.139
starting up again it's good to know

1040.769 --> 1046.39
yeah I have builded myself sorry but I

1044.62 --> 1048.4589999999998
was saying nathan is not stealing my

1046.39 --> 1051.279
thunder he's just putting out the

1048.459 --> 1057.8200000000002
hangout link he always does that before

1051.279 --> 1060.22
the show starts and he'll probably just

1057.82 --> 1061.36
started at two o'clock London time which

1060.22 --> 1075.25
is in half an hour

1061.36 --> 1078.07
don't worry about it what Oh am i okay

1075.25 --> 1084.61
I'm not sure if nathan is gonna have his

1078.07 --> 1088.4089999999999
daughter on the debates except of course

1084.61 --> 1088.4089999999999
for for Eleanor

1090.61 --> 1093.6799999999998
[Music]

1095.5 --> 1105.94
I think clovers probably just gonna be

1100.09 --> 1109.75
with with her mother in the next room or

1105.94 --> 1113.6100000000001
I don't know where they are I mean where

1109.75 --> 1113.61
they will be will see in half an hour

1120.76 --> 1129.0
all right well we'll find out when it's

1124.179 --> 1129.0
goes live which is in half an hour

1129.99 --> 1136.36
see ah son is coming back yes I am

1134.38 --> 1142.0800000000002
seeing some chemtrails being sprayed

1136.36 --> 1142.08
though I don't know I just

1144.69 --> 1147.9
[Music]

1153.54 --> 1166.71
the webcam is so much yeah my eyes can

1161.52 --> 1170.94
see so much better than the webcam so

1166.71 --> 1171.96
surprising contrast I really need that

1170.94 --> 1174.3
p900

1171.96 --> 1179.13
because then at least I could share what

1174.3 --> 1181.74
I'm really seeing but yeah there's some

1179.13 --> 1185.0300000000002
chemtrails not too bad not seeing them

1181.74 --> 1185.03
all over the place at least

1193.35 --> 1200.9089999999999
right yet WB 84 it's posted in the Skype

1199.049 --> 1203.61
chat rooms where he always does that

1200.909 --> 1207.45
first doesn't make it public before the

1203.61 --> 1212.039
Hangout actually starts it's because of

1207.45 --> 1216.96
the the pre-show so there is a pre-show

1212.039 --> 1222.6
but it's only for for ya known members

1216.96 --> 1225.24
that are in the master beat yet now I

1222.6 --> 1226.23
could Simon stream going on there for

1225.24 --> 1234.509
the fun of it

1226.23 --> 1239.3700000000001
it's a bit weird but Nath oh really

1234.509 --> 1243.6200000000001
Thank You [ __ ] yous that's awesome thank

1239.37 --> 1243.62

1254.029 --> 1259.019
thanks man

1255.39 --> 1264.0
oh yeah and by the way I don't know how

1259.019 --> 1266.46
many how many of you guys and gals have

1264.0 --> 1268.71
patreon but yeah I do have a patreon

1266.46 --> 1273.3600000000001
these days I just got the one subscriber

1268.71 --> 1275.519
I remember I don't even know what to

1273.36 --> 1281.49
call it is it members or subscribers I

1275.519 --> 1284.97
don't know but yeah if you if you could

1281.49 --> 1288.179

1284.97 --> 1291.09
is also gonna be helpful very much I

1288.179 --> 1296.039
think yeah because whatever I'm getting

1291.09 --> 1299.1
right now yeah I can definitely use that

[ __ ] yous for the PayPal donation

1353.48 --> 1360.33
huh

1355.32 --> 1362.9399999999998
thanks hon Carlos yeah CBD oil you can

1360.33 --> 1366.3
get that here as well and I'm very

1362.94 --> 1369.78
curious about it and I've I know that in

1366.3 --> 1374.82
the stores that I get like my my filters

1369.78 --> 1377.79
my carbon filters for smoking it's very

1374.82 --> 1381.6599999999999
beneficial takes away a lot of the

1377.79 --> 1384.6599999999999
health hazards from smoking in general I

1381.66 --> 1387.21
know they have CBD oil but yeah the last

1384.66 --> 1389.43
time I checked it was like okay oh this

1387.21 --> 1392.94
is I I would like this how much is it oh

1389.43 --> 1398.63
it's just a hundred euros back you know

1392.94 --> 1398.63
that's that stuff is freaking expensive

1399.2 --> 1405.57
well not not that cannabis isn't

1401.61 --> 1408.78
expensive to be fair but yeah it is

1405.57 --> 1414.51
expensive and it's a big chunk all at

1408.78 --> 1417.09
once so I don't know I'm gonna have to

1414.51 --> 1419.42
try it out when my finances have scaled

1417.09 --> 1422.4599999999998
up which should happen eventually

1419.42 --> 1432.15
absolutely inevitably if nothing goes

1422.46 --> 1435.54
horribly wrong no that's not true as

1432.15 --> 1439.23
McLeod the THC is not the medicine

1435.54 --> 1443.6399999999999
although it can be therapeutical but it

1439.23 --> 1446.91
is true that the true CBD effect does

1443.64 --> 1451.5600000000002
work better if there's also at least

1446.91 --> 1454.8000000000002
some THC in there that is true if the

1451.56 --> 1455.3999999999999
THC is completely a hundred percent out

1454.8 --> 1458.58
of air

1455.4 --> 1461.76
then the CBD does still work but not as

1458.58 --> 1465.9199999999998
good as it yeah yes with just a little

1461.76 --> 1465.92
tea I see next to it

1467.899 --> 1472.8899999999999
besides it doesn't necessarily need to

1470.19 --> 1476.279
be heated it's really when THC is heated

1472.89 --> 1478.8500000000001
when the psychotropic effects are

1476.279 --> 1478.85
unleashed

1480.32 --> 1487.049
but yeah CBD oil it has amazing

1484.679 --> 1490.47
properties I haven't

1487.049 --> 1492.69
to be fair I have never literally tried

1490.47 --> 1495.809
it out been confronted by it many times

1492.69 --> 1498.69
do you have seen other people use it

1495.809 --> 1503.7
with great results especially people

1498.69 --> 1506.549
that had absolute epitome was just like

1503.7 --> 1510.8400000000001
it was gone bang like even 10 years ago

1506.549 --> 1515.1299999999999
I knew somebody through the group where

1510.84 --> 1517.26
we congregated about conspiracy theory

1515.13 --> 1519.779
related things like anti vexing and

1517.26 --> 1523.649
chemtrails and that was like 10 years

1519.779 --> 1526.409
ago and there were people there that

1523.649 --> 1528.389
were themselves at one point had a heavy

1526.409 --> 1531.0590000000002
epilepsy and some of them had children

1528.389 --> 1533.82
that had epilepsy they used cannabis oil

1531.059 --> 1537.779
they did like smoking and we're really

1533.82 --> 1539.789
against it but yeah the oil yeah they

1537.779 --> 1542.279
were for that and they used it and just

1539.789 --> 1545.37
completely got rid of the epilepsy

1542.279 --> 1549.23
altogether and that was ten years ago so

1545.37 --> 1552.57
I I trust that that definitely works

1549.23 --> 1555.48
it's good to try it out it can't really

1552.57 --> 1558.57
do any harm because the oil doesn't have

1555.48 --> 1562.429
any psychotropic effects because there's

1558.57 --> 1562.4289999999999
no tea heated THC if it's done properly

1564.2 --> 1572.3890000000001
and yeah it will do amazing things for

1567.539 --> 1572.389
your body and so sad also

1574.66 --> 1584.42
naturally remove put the cancers if

1578.66 --> 1588.44
you've got any like yeah it that's

1584.42 --> 1591.41
what's the THC receptor and it said like

1588.44 --> 1593.93
THC CBD combination what it does is just

1591.41 --> 1596.15
go to the candy coat spreads out through

1593.93 --> 1598.91
the body goes to the specific type of

1596.15 --> 1602.99
cancer cells just tells them look you're

1598.91 --> 1604.22
mutated you got to die now cancer cells

1602.99 --> 1609.71
will go oh [ __ ]

1604.22 --> 1611.54
really oh damn I had no idea okay so

1609.71 --> 1617.99
they're just yeah it's an amazing

1611.54 --> 1620.24
process for widely tested and at a some

1617.99 --> 1622.28
time ago I don't even know how it's done

1620.24 --> 1625.28
right now but in the Netherlands they

1622.28 --> 1628.1
were like gonna introduce cannabis

1625.28 --> 1630.47
medically besides the smoking in the

1628.1 --> 1633.52
coffee shop thing I think it is kind of

1630.47 --> 1636.94
still an option in certain cases

1633.52 --> 1640.99
although with cancer treatment it's only

1636.94 --> 1642.65
officially allowed to relieve the pain

1640.99 --> 1645.05
yeah really

1642.65 --> 1648.47
they just don't ascribe any kind of

1645.05 --> 1654.74
cancer healing mechanism to it it's

1648.47 --> 1656.6000000000001
really annoying right but yeah as long

1654.74 --> 1659.45
as it's available then you can figure

1656.6 --> 1662.3899999999999
out what what to do and you choose your

1659.45 --> 1669.56
path whatever the official story about

1662.39 --> 1674.24
the products are so anyway I will try

1669.56 --> 1677.99
CBD oil at some point just as I will

1674.24 --> 1681.32
definitely I I feel I am gonna try brain

1677.99 --> 1683.93
force somewhere in the near future and

1681.32 --> 1688.1299999999999
I'm gonna try it very carefully because

1683.93 --> 1690.5600000000002
I have had like my reserves in trying it

1688.13 --> 1694.5100000000002
because of the heavy effects it can have

1690.56 --> 1697.1789999999999
on the mind

1694.51 --> 1702.25
and thing I'm kind of nervous about is

1697.179 --> 1704.5900000000001
that it might it sounds weird but it

1702.25 --> 1708.34
might actually make me more intelligent

1704.59 --> 1713.29
to a level that it's actually gonna be

1708.34 --> 1715.78
very punishing to me because I might

1713.29 --> 1717.549
have more clarity causing me to actually

1715.78 --> 1721.6
want to do more things and then

1717.549 --> 1724.059
realizing oh [ __ ] but I'm trapped here

1721.6 --> 1728.3799999999999
so it might that's why I've been very

1724.059 --> 1730.3899999999999
reserved in trying it out it's I don't

1728.38 --> 1732.73
know maybe it's just me getting in my

1730.39 --> 1736.8400000000001
own way but I want to try it out

1732.73 --> 1739.0
sometime soon I still have the sealed

1736.84 --> 1743.799
bottle and the first thing I ever

1739.0 --> 1747.82
ordered at the info war sore but yeah

1743.799 --> 1750.73
I've had very elaborate dark world

1747.82 --> 1753.4289999999999
related visions concerning that stuff

1750.73 --> 1755.47
like that's the moment I thought I knew

1753.429 --> 1758.74
it like oh I recognize this this is

1755.47 --> 1763.29
something big something that should not

1758.74 --> 1767.61
be taken lightly and I got it

1763.29 --> 1767.61
but I have never taken it

1774.539 --> 1782.849
my yeah my my best plan that I can think

1778.44 --> 1788.1290000000001
of for using it is basically the moment

1782.849 --> 1790.859
I want to make plans and actually

1788.129 --> 1792.899
executing them that are kind of

1790.859 --> 1795.029
ambitious where I have to do a lot and

1792.899 --> 1799.139
keep my concentration and then it would

1795.029 --> 1800.579
be ideal for what it is set to do so I

1799.139 --> 1803.1589999999999
shouldn't be dead just taking it

1800.579 --> 1804.629
casually only when I'm actually gonna do

1803.159 --> 1808.169
something otherwise I might frustrate

1804.629 --> 1812.009
myself with boredom while being in such

1808.169 --> 1816.0590000000002
a state so I have to be careful on the

1812.009 --> 1817.8890000000001
other hand it might just force me to get

1816.059 --> 1819.989
creative it might just give me a giant

1817.889 --> 1822.779
brain wave and I'll just get creative

1819.989 --> 1826.709
just like I was constantly during my

1822.779 --> 1829.139
teens constantly drawing [ __ ] seeing

1826.709 --> 1832.949
stuff thinking up stuff and drawing it

1829.139 --> 1835.4989999999998
out so we'll see ah thank and drunk

1832.949 --> 1839.5790000000002
Thank You drunken bullet for one one for

1835.499 --> 1842.429
this to Australian dollar super jet

1839.579 --> 1846.389
donation for my the p900 fun thank you

1842.429 --> 1849.479
very much yeah now I by the way I fully

1846.389 --> 1854.9399999999998
expect that I will get the P 900 in

1849.479 --> 1857.219
within the year I hope for the most that

1854.94 --> 1860.489
I will somehow be able to get it this

1857.219 --> 1864.839
summer so I can get out there with that

1860.489 --> 1870.539
thing and just at least get a couple of

1864.839 --> 1874.079
good shots that maybe some clear star

1870.539 --> 1876.299
night skies and all that just yeah in

1874.079 --> 1878.549
the summer yeah if I get it like in

1876.299 --> 1880.979
December it's gonna be shitty weather

1878.549 --> 1883.9189999999999
not very compelling to just go out with

1880.979 --> 1885.8690000000001
it but in the summer it would be much

1883.919 --> 1887.8190000000002
better and I expect that I will have the

1885.869 --> 1891.7189999999998
funds together thanks to all you guys

1887.819 --> 1893.94
and my own situation can't guarantee it

1891.719 --> 1896.69
though but I will do my best

1893.94 --> 1896.69
jeez

1898.37 --> 1904.83
right

1899.7 --> 1907.8300000000002
hello Ali B yeah Chili's good for a

1904.83 --> 1912.6299999999999
depression I red hot chili yeah I agree

1907.83 --> 1917.1599999999999
I you know what I eat it daily almost in

1912.63 --> 1923.22
everything not everything but almost all

1917.16 --> 1923.52
my dinners have chili in them not all of

1923.22 --> 1928.65
it

1923.52 --> 1931.62
like when I eat pasta I don't really use

1928.65 --> 1935.67
peppers in them but anything else pretty

1931.62 --> 1938.58
much yeah I will use Red Hot Chili

1935.67 --> 1941.01
Peppers I love him and it's very good

1938.58 --> 1943.56
for the heart and your overall blood

1941.01 --> 1947.85
system has a lot of vitamins in them

1943.56 --> 1950.7
very useful especially when they're all

1947.85 --> 1953.1599999999999
organic and it's not even that expensive

1950.7 --> 1957.42
although it depends on how much there is

1953.16 --> 1959.46
available but when there's plenty it's

1957.42 --> 1968.13
really dirt cheap even when they're

1959.46 --> 1973.77
purely organic hmm yeah just make sure

1968.13 --> 1976.3200000000002
you don't have any wounds where around

1973.77 --> 1978.57
your nails or anything like that because

1976.32 --> 1980.25
it'd be kind of you screwing with red

1978.57 --> 1984.33
hot chili pepper you're gonna have like

1980.25 --> 1986.48
a painful finger all day so be careful

1984.33 --> 1986.48
with that

1989.51 --> 1993.59
wait am I talking about

1999.98 --> 2008.6390000000001
hey peanuts Clark what are you referring

2003.22 --> 2012.299
to not a good experience coming out

2008.639 --> 2012.299
coming out with what

2032.96 --> 2042.099
I don't get it

2035.179 --> 2045.019
no no jazz you're too late

2042.099 --> 2048.44
you don't get to join the show 15

2045.019 --> 2050.899
minutes before the end it's not the

2048.44 --> 2058.279
weekend in the weekends it's open panel

2050.899 --> 2061.5389999999998
time and yeah again anyone can join then

2058.279 --> 2061.539
but not right now

2064.0 --> 2069.069
no no PJ I did not

2080.47 --> 2094.22
you know when I mean it I mean it I'm

2091.31 --> 2096.23
not like a a weak liberal that just

2094.22 --> 2099.68
thinks oh you can just go over the top

2096.23 --> 2101.96
and insane every time if you just

2099.68 --> 2104.87
apologize afterward and make yourself

2101.96 --> 2106.46
look like a total apologist coward no I

2104.87 --> 2109.3399999999997
don't do that when I go overboard

2106.46 --> 2112.1
against the person it's gonna be on

2109.34 --> 2115.52
target in if I in the moment go too far

2112.1 --> 2117.86
that I feel off I will address it

2115.52 --> 2120.38
immediately like okay sorry that went

2117.86 --> 2123.7400000000002
too far and then continue on lower level

2120.38 --> 2125.9
that's how I do it once I say it and I

2123.74 --> 2129.3799999999997
figure out no it's in place I'm not

2125.9 --> 2136.63
gonna apologize for it I never do that

2129.38 --> 2142.04
a really flatlander

2136.63 --> 2144.4900000000002
what was she correct at I gotta hear

2142.04 --> 2144.49
this one

2149.72 --> 2159.5899999999997
oh really dysfunctional you don't

2156.05 --> 2165.71
believe it well good for you you just

2159.59 --> 2168.76
your just trust a medical system I'm

2165.71 --> 2171.76
sure that will end up great for you

2168.76 --> 2171.76
eventually

2181.14 --> 2188.67
right well flatlander the thing is she

2185.64 --> 2192.24
was constantly emphasizing the different

2188.67 --> 2194.34
steps but she wasn't actually addressing

2192.24 --> 2196.3199999999997
the method itself she was just

2194.34 --> 2199.2000000000003
addressing the steps but she wasn't

2196.32 --> 2200.79
getting to the point which was the

2199.2 --> 2203.2799999999997
independent variable that has to be

2200.79 --> 2206.66
varied in him is the presumed cause of

2203.28 --> 2210.6000000000004
the effects within the observation and

2206.66 --> 2213.1099999999997
she just bypassed that she literally up

2210.6 --> 2215.94
to four or five times did not address it

2213.11 --> 2220.5
describe the processes surrounding that

2215.94 --> 2222.69
and then named that part as one word not

2220.5 --> 2225.42
addressing the actual structure within a

2222.69 --> 2227.93
to bypass it to red-herring it and that

2225.42 --> 2231.1800000000003
she kept on doing that constantly and

2227.93 --> 2234.8399999999997
yeah she was right about the the

2231.18 --> 2238.1299999999997
overarching steps the the procedures but

2234.84 --> 2242.6400000000003
she never addressed the actual method

2238.13 --> 2244.59
and that's why I got pissed off at her

2242.64 --> 2247.47
because she was just blatantly

2244.59 --> 2250.02
red-herring me and I literally addressed

2247.47 --> 2252.7799999999997
her many times very directly very

2250.02 --> 2255.57
angrily and if you keep on bypassing it

2252.78 --> 2261.3900000000003
yeah then you're trolling and I'm gonna

2255.57 --> 2264.38
call you a [ __ ] or at least Brenda and

2261.39 --> 2264.3799999999997
eventually kick her

2269.73 --> 2272.829
[Music]

2280.81 --> 2283.71
hmm

2283.789 --> 2291.0190000000002
right that's ridiculous

2288.779 --> 2294.71
sorry but anyone who doesn't believe in

2291.019 --> 2299.16
chemtrails that's ridiculous because

2294.71 --> 2303.119
it's officially admit an N document for

2299.16 --> 2307.5
decades that geoengineering programs

2303.119 --> 2311.46
using aerosol particles sprayed by

2307.5 --> 2314.549
planes is being tested officially in

2311.46 --> 2317.9700000000003
progress initiated it's going on

2314.549 --> 2320.73
officially that just not literally show

2317.97 --> 2322.769
you oh yeah today look in this region

2320.73 --> 2326.039
we're spraying this and the thing is I

2322.769 --> 2328.68
think they should do that I think they

2326.039 --> 2330.2400000000002
should just come out what they're doing

2328.68 --> 2335.609
if they're gonna be geoengineering

2330.24 --> 2338.3289999999997
somehow sure just be honest about it if

2335.609 --> 2342.589
you're going to be doing it anyway and

2338.329 --> 2348.0
yeah get some oversight some insights oh

2342.589 --> 2352.619
yeah there's not any secret chemical or

2348.0 --> 2354.71
pharmacological crap being sprayed you

2352.619 --> 2354.71
know

2357.229 --> 2362.2189999999996
all right yeah I do hear that in the

2360.329 --> 2367.9500000000003
United States the chemtrails spraying is

2362.219 --> 2371.88
absolutely insane in the Netherlands not

2367.95 --> 2378.259
so much but they do spray a lot

2371.88 --> 2381.989
sometimes but rarely afterward do I

2378.259 --> 2385.049
experience that like oh [ __ ] there's

2381.989 --> 2387.359
something really bad in the air or get

2385.049 --> 2391.529
trouble breathing or everybody gets sick

2387.359 --> 2395.239
all of a sudden it sickness usually is

2391.529 --> 2397.89
induced rather by abrupt weather and

2395.239 --> 2401.729
temperature changes really that's what

2397.89 --> 2404.19
triggers the metabolic effect of getting

2401.729 --> 2411.18
a cold and that could potentially lead

2404.19 --> 2414.44
to other unresolved conditions giving ya

2411.18 --> 2414.44
more serious sickness

2417.63 --> 2422.6400000000003
right yeah I think that probably the

2420.36 --> 2425.46
u.s. is being hit very hard with

2422.64 --> 2428.2799999999997
chemtrails in general compared to Europe

2425.46 --> 2431.2200000000003
they still do it here but I think that

2428.28 --> 2432.2000000000003
just really to me I really more and more

2431.22 --> 2437.2799999999997
to think that they're just

2432.2 --> 2441.83
geoengineering carefully and I wish they

2437.28 --> 2441.8300000000004
would just be honest about it

2446.73 --> 2451.68
a levy yeah you got a good point it

2449.369 --> 2458.9
could be that they are indeed actually

2451.68 --> 2463.8199999999997
manipulating the the market because like

2458.9 --> 2465.96
public events do stand or fall

2463.82 --> 2468.81
economically with what the weather

2465.96 --> 2471.56
condition is going to be and if they

2468.81 --> 2475.7999999999997
know because they can engineer they can

2471.56 --> 2479.64
make something a success or a disaster

2475.8 --> 2482.55
and nobody would know but them

2479.64 --> 2484.5
officially so yeah they could be abusing

2482.55 --> 2487.1400000000003
the [ __ ] out of it economically that's

2484.5 --> 2490.94
true that would be a good reason why

2487.14 --> 2490.94
they don't really want to classify it

2500.94 --> 2507.42
all right [ __ ] use pole shifts yeah I've

2504.21 --> 2512.93
been hearing some about that I think

2507.42 --> 2519.21
that the pole may is shifting I think

2512.93 --> 2522.8399999999997
wasn't it from Canada roughly near

2519.21 --> 2526.2
Canada towards Russia so they say

2522.84 --> 2528.4100000000003
assuming that model assuming either a

2526.2 --> 2532.08
disk or a globe

2528.41 --> 2533.6099999999997
it could be shifting but it doesn't mean

2532.08 --> 2535.44
that it's just gonna go shift and just

2533.61 --> 2537.0
continue shifting and shifting until

2535.44 --> 2539.52
it's on the other side I think that is a

2537.0 --> 2542.88
fantasy story I think it's rather just

2539.52 --> 2545.79
gonna shift over to Russia probably stop

2542.88 --> 2548.9700000000003
and then stay either there for a long

2545.79 --> 2551.1
time or slowly swing back and start

2548.97 --> 2558.0499999999997
shifting back to Canada again that's

2551.1 --> 2558.0499999999997
what I expect it'll take a long time

2561.2 --> 2567.319
so I don't believe in the polar reversal

2564.41 --> 2570.73
as it were and I think that is part of

2567.319 --> 2570.73
the science fiction narrative

2579.32 --> 2587.6600000000003
I wouldn't know Jessica nah I wouldn't

2582.68 --> 2591.2599999999998
know I don't get to look at the skies in

2587.66 --> 2593.41
the southern hemisphere or south of the

2591.26 --> 2593.4100000000003
Equator

2618.29 --> 2627.77
I have no idea am i okay okay some

2622.81 --> 2630.59
suspicious observer I think had a video

2627.77 --> 2630.92
of something right by the moon last 24

2630.59 --> 2635.63
hours

2630.92 --> 2638.1800000000003
right so what what something right by

2635.63 --> 2640.6400000000003
the moon that's about as unspecific as

2638.18 --> 2643.0899999999997
you can get I have no idea I have not

2640.64 --> 2643.0899999999997
seen it

2653.08 --> 2658.27
right dysfunctional is very easy how do

2656.89 --> 2663.58
you distinguish chemtrails from

2658.27 --> 2668.65
contrails yeah okay chemtrails contrails

2663.58 --> 2671.3199999999997
look kind of the same but differences

2668.65 --> 2674.23
contrails evaporate no matter the

2671.32 --> 2677.9500000000003
condition if whether it be cold the

2674.23 --> 2680.35
winter or warm in the summer or anything

2677.95 --> 2682.06
they're gonna evaporate in the winter

2680.35 --> 2684.0099999999998
they take a little longer to evaporate

2682.06 --> 2686.14
but they evaporate they leave nothing

2684.01 --> 2690.9100000000003
behind they dissolve within the air

2686.14 --> 2697.68
surrounding it chemtrails do not they

2690.91 --> 2701.85
stay and they get fluffy and wavy and

2697.68 --> 2705.46
they spread out and they become hazy

2701.85 --> 2708.31
eventually and they form clouds and you

2705.46 --> 2710.62
can see it widen as if they're very hard

2708.31 --> 2714.19
winds they shift all over the place they

2710.62 --> 2717.25
can migrate literally migrate over time

2714.19 --> 2720.52
you can see them move I've seen like

2717.25 --> 2724.87
chemtrails being sprayed right over here

2720.52 --> 2728.98
and then basically shifting into the

2724.87 --> 2731.23
distance gradually and then clear sky

2728.98 --> 2732.94
would be there in the same place or

2731.23 --> 2735.87
chemtrails being sprayed in the far

2732.94 --> 2743.35
distance and then just moving right over

2735.87 --> 2746.35
so em trails they are not water or any

2743.35 --> 2752.68
type of gas particles they are solids of

2746.35 --> 2756.81
some kind can be dust of yeah well it it

2752.68 --> 2761.71
is said traditionally it is aluminum

2756.81 --> 2764.0499999999997
dust and barium salts and potentially

2761.71 --> 2766.12
some other things that is what is kind

2764.05 --> 2768.82
of yeah that's what been has been

2766.12 --> 2773.74
measured and detected and deduced from

2768.82 --> 2775.59
laboratory experiments figuring out what

2773.74 --> 2778.4399999999996
was in the rain water at the time

2775.59 --> 2782.2000000000003
compared to locations where these

2778.44 --> 2784.27
chemtrails were not seen ever and yeah

2782.2 --> 2786.9399999999996
that's what they detected those

2784.27 --> 2790.56
substances but I don't know if that's

2786.94 --> 2793.599
still the case if they still spray that

2790.56 --> 2799.839
because it could be they just change it

2793.599 --> 2803.73
I personally would go for just like sand

2799.839 --> 2808.5099999999998
dust very fine silicon dust because that

2803.73 --> 2811.15
naturally tends to form clouds all that

2808.51 --> 2813.4
it's because of it used before the chem

2811.15 --> 2818.44
trailing started like before the the

2813.4 --> 2821.589
late 90s the meteorologist basically

2818.44 --> 2823.75
said right there's certain Sahara winds

2821.589 --> 2827.38
and there's a giant dust cloud sometimes

2823.75 --> 2830.44
it will fall down you would get sand in

2827.38 --> 2832.69
the in Netherlands sand just blowing

2830.44 --> 2835.27
over and falling down and you'd have

2832.69 --> 2838.27
like sand on your car and everywhere it

2835.27 --> 2841.65
was weird and sometimes it can hit a

2838.27 --> 2844.359
rain front or some moist air and then

2841.65 --> 2847.319
giant rain clouds would come out of that

2844.359 --> 2850.45
so they could just as well be using fine

2847.319 --> 2854.41
sand dust in my opinion to achieve

2850.45 --> 2856.5989999999997
similar effects but that is only if they

2854.41 --> 2860.109
just want to use it for geoengineering

2856.599 --> 2862.569
for weather control because it could be

2860.109 --> 2864.339
that their dual purposing it and that is

2862.569 --> 2869.14
why they are using the aluminum and

2864.339 --> 2875.02
barium salts for for example electrical

2869.14 --> 2877.2999999999997
conduction to make mobile transmissions

2875.02 --> 2881.859
and all that more functional or some

2877.3 --> 2884.05
other wireless communication type

2881.859 --> 2887.71
purpose some people say oh it's to

2884.05 --> 2890.53
assist HAARP and all that maybe maybe

2887.71 --> 2893.9700000000003
maybe that gives it the option to just

2890.53 --> 2897.52
quickly use that for some reason but

2893.97 --> 2899.56
yeah I don't like that at all and I if

2897.52 --> 2902.05
they're gonna keep on geoengineering I

2899.56 --> 2905.77
don't really even object but don't use

2902.05 --> 2907.51
toxic things for it just help nature a

2905.77 --> 2912.52
little if you're going to be do

2907.51 --> 2914.92
something anyway you know yeah sorry

2912.52 --> 2917.2599999999998
leb know I'm not giving links today and

2914.92 --> 2920.369
Nathan is just has just started his life

2917.26 --> 2924.6400000000003
show so I'm gonna round out my show

2920.369 --> 2926.109
maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow I will

2924.64 --> 2936.609
give out the link a little bit more

2926.109 --> 2938.3199999999997
quickly so right mm-hmm all right rentee

2936.609 --> 2941.88
allergic to camp girls could be

2938.32 --> 2945.01
it can also be psychosomatically induced

2941.88 --> 2947.4100000000003
that's a that's an issue that's a real

2945.01 --> 2949.03
thing if you think something is going to

2947.41 --> 2951.64
do something and you are very anxious

2949.03 --> 2954.76
about it you may get a psychosomatic

2951.64 --> 2957.64
response reinforcing that belief that

2954.76 --> 2960.69
actually happens it's a medical thing

2957.64 --> 2967.17
that happens to people and animals too

2960.69 --> 2971.579
psychosomatic response but could also be

2967.17 --> 2974.23
yeah that he is sensitive to certain

2971.579 --> 2978.0
chemicals yeah that's the problem I

2974.23 --> 2981.19
don't know if they're spraying chemicals

2978.0 --> 2984.28
sometimes in some reason regions for

2981.19 --> 2986.349
some reason they could be doing that I

2984.28 --> 2992.53
don't know I have no confirmation of

2986.349 --> 2994.06
that but it could be so anyway yeah I am

2992.53 --> 2997.1800000000003
gonna round out the show so thanks

3035.579 --> 3040.319
go to the Flat Earth debates right after

3037.77 --> 3041.67
this join that panel so until the net

3040.319 --> 3046.819
next Flat Earth

3041.67 --> 3046.819
