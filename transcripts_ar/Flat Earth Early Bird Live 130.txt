36.21 --> 44.230000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.6 --> 52.21
early-bird number 130 I'm your host

44.23 --> 56.28
Arwen and today it's not cold it's gonna

52.21 --> 63.63
agree they're building everywhere here

56.28 --> 63.63
weird it's not even cold or anything

64.42 --> 67.049
No

67.86 --> 74.03999999999999
you're planting the trees I still don't

70.08 --> 79.47
know exactly where maybe in that open

74.04 --> 82.23
field to check it out sometime later

79.47 --> 85.7
apparently building a bridge in a very

82.23 --> 85.7
weird place up ahead

87.9 --> 94.05000000000001
right in between two buildings doesn't

92.73 --> 99.09
make any sense to me that they would

94.05 --> 104.42
build a bridge there is lots of noise

99.09 --> 104.42
good morning till afternoon

107.53 --> 120.52
so yeah let's use in chat

111.69 --> 128.34
Steve a JM Obama called John Watson flat

120.52 --> 132.39
ball four in each you'd thought use a

128.34 --> 135.69
lot he says for very short time

132.39 --> 135.69
righteous force

154.73 --> 157.98899999999998
anyway hello guys

164.67 --> 173.51999999999998
yeah I was weird yesterday just go my

169.47 --> 176.959
business so do debates I'm not sure but

173.52 --> 180.63000000000002
Horry suddenly put out this real

176.959 --> 185.04
pissed-off video wasn't really a video

180.63 --> 189.01999999999998
just one message no sound and he was

185.04 --> 192.69
apparently very pissed off Flat Earth

189.02 --> 194.58
community I even asked him over Skype

192.69 --> 198.45
because I got a mouse cape like hey

194.58 --> 202.91000000000003
what's going on no answer so does

198.45 --> 202.91
anybody know why he did that

205.12 --> 210.31900000000002
probably just needed a break or

207.23 --> 212.84
something but why he did it

210.319 --> 215.14
in ragequit fashion like that it was

212.84 --> 215.14000000000001
weird

221.739 --> 224.73000000000002
Oh Jeffrey bill

229.61 --> 237.05
yeah John Watson Hori from the Hori

232.04 --> 240.59
sheets show had a weird angry video

237.05 --> 242.18
message to Flat Earth community that he

240.59 --> 246.56
was pissed off at them and he's

242.18 --> 250.55
basically quitting so kind of like a

246.56 --> 254.63
rage quit but it's very weird unexpected

250.55 --> 258.91
I don't know why he did that and I asked

254.63 --> 258.90999999999997
him over Skype and with no response

269.07 --> 272.17
[Music]

274.83 --> 282.78
yeah apparently one of my videos got

277.59 --> 287.9
taken down the first Christchurch video

282.78 --> 287.9
I made and the reason they gave for it

288.5 --> 298.319
was that I'm apparently well one of the

293.819 --> 300.87
reasons was because videos denying that

298.319 --> 309.09000000000003
a well-documented violent event took

300.87 --> 314.96
place so I didn't do that wasn't being

309.09 --> 314.96
racist either or promoting hatred

318.439 --> 323.779
apparently you can't have a conspiracy

320.909 --> 326.759
about secret services or anything or

323.779 --> 330.629
either I don't know doesn't make any

326.759 --> 334.83000000000004
sense to me but yeah that video was

330.629 --> 337.97900000000004
taken down and I'm expecting a strike

334.83 --> 340.55899999999997
for it I don't even know how to properly

337.979 --> 342.779
repeal that and I don't think they're

340.559 --> 346.819
gonna listen I'm just I'm even too

342.779 --> 346.819
pissed off to properly respond to it

348.449 --> 356.969
because yeah it was just life journalism

352.919 --> 361.19899999999996
with somebody from the location and I

356.969 --> 362.039
was very careful I wasn't trying to hurt

361.199 --> 366.259
anyone

362.039 --> 368.699
it was just asking good questions and

366.259 --> 373.559
keeping open the possibilities

368.699 --> 375.87
trying to stay critical and yeah yeah I

373.559 --> 377.90900000000005
got a strike for that like for all the

375.87 --> 383.719
things to get a strike from for that

377.909 --> 383.719
I just find it utterly insulting

387.759 --> 393.159
so yeah I'm kind of expecting the same

390.49 --> 396.669
thing now that happened to own Benjamin

393.159 --> 400.05899999999997
to happen to me that I'll get

396.669 --> 402.87899999999996
demonetised for it and yeah that all

400.059 --> 408.84900000000005
those super Jets will be returned to

402.879 --> 411.819
sender basically but luckily I still got

408.849 --> 416.009
PayPal and I have been receiving a lot

411.819 --> 418.569
of help from several people through that

416.009 --> 421.36
so yeah if they're gonna do this and I

418.569 --> 423.839
kind of am expecting that they will then

421.36 --> 428.589
yeah it's just goodbye super chat and

423.839 --> 432.099
please send it through PayPal if you

428.589 --> 434.02
still find that worth it because that

432.099 --> 437.699
way I still get it and they simply don't

434.02 --> 437.69899999999996
get anything so it's their problem

440.12 --> 446.1
that's ridiculous right is for us I'm

442.62 --> 449.16
gonna talk about everything as much as

446.1 --> 452.52000000000004
possible in a way that I think is

449.16 --> 455.84000000000003
responsible and I'm not gonna be

452.52 --> 455.84
censored I doesn't work

462.58 --> 470.59
and yeah even my own damn city is

466.8 --> 472.599
indirectly involved in this and so much

470.59 --> 474.63899999999995
is involved in this and responding to

472.599 --> 478.659
the whole New Zealand situation and

474.639 --> 483.0
everything so you can silence me about

478.659 --> 483.0
that I'm in the middle of it basically

522.21 --> 528.89
if we'll all be censored then there will

525.6 --> 528.89
be nothing left for them

592.53 --> 596.78
I wouldn't do that if I were you John

594.36 --> 596.78
Watson

602.1 --> 605.9590000000001
you'll just get banned everywhere

607.24 --> 611.97
people don't like she'll spam you know

627.59 --> 629.62
a

634.08 --> 639.12
let's see I kind of have to get into

636.209 --> 645.209
what has been going on or then hoary and

639.12 --> 649.32
oh yeah how's Logan Paul his documentary

645.209 --> 651.18
I I don't have a good feeling about that

649.32 --> 654.1700000000001
I haven't had a good feeling about that

651.18 --> 654.17
guy in general

658.1 --> 665.84
so yeah it's probably going to be kind

662.84 --> 670.45
of the hit piece where he's gonna clown

665.84 --> 670.45
around if you ask me

682.75 --> 686.01
I have no idea

696.61 --> 703.74
okay is it already out I don't know is

699.279 --> 703.74
it have some of you seen it

717.75 --> 722.899
hmm right okay so it's not out yet fine

724.75 --> 728.07
you sure to have a look

757.27 --> 760.26
so yeah

762.67 --> 768.579
I need to focus I wish some of you guys

766.63 --> 770.9399999999999
would just come on the panel and talk

768.579 --> 770.9399999999999
there

771.239 --> 776.86
because then I wouldn't be staring at

775.179 --> 780.029
the chat trying to follow what you guys

776.86 --> 780.029
are talking about so much

788.21 --> 794.0600000000001
drama is there a lot of drama

831.27 --> 837.99
I have been to be fair like I also

835.14 --> 841.68
follow lift a veil for some time I've

837.99 --> 845.3100000000001
been seeing a couple of I don't know

841.68 --> 850.649
more weird tricky videos of him anyone

845.31 --> 853.4399999999999
he really in my opinion badly criticized

850.649 --> 856.98
Alex Jones and now of course Alex Jones

853.44 --> 863.97
does is a serif criticism never deny

856.98 --> 865.74
that but yeah it was seemed like it was

863.97 --> 869.0
out of place

865.74 --> 874.23
he missed the tone and he deleted it

869.0 --> 876.589
afterward and he kind of talked around

874.23 --> 876.589
it

877.65 --> 884.01
I think he was just in a really bad

880.49 --> 888.51
angry mood or something but that didn't

884.01 --> 891.5
really show but in his acting but yeah

888.51 --> 891.5
was just

891.94 --> 900.399
it's kind of an inviting effect as well

894.1 --> 904.1990000000001
was weird and he seems to be addressing

900.399 --> 909.089
more people that are kind of part of

904.199 --> 912.04
Alex Jones and other independent people

909.089 --> 914.769
after own talking points that are moving

912.04 --> 920.41
around and I don't know why he's doing

914.769 --> 922.529
that gives me a little worried I don't

920.41 --> 922.529
know

935.36 --> 942.499
yeah also it's been yeah kind of

939.11 --> 945.799
noteworthy that yeah you might or might

942.499 --> 948.11
not have noticed that if you follow Alex

945.799 --> 952.399
Jones you'll notice there being a lot

948.11 --> 953.809
more critical of Trump these days it's

952.399 --> 955.759
kind of refreshing they're really

953.809 --> 957.98
addressing okay he's doing this right

955.759 --> 960.319
and this is [ __ ] what the hell are you

957.98 --> 962.509
doing what are you thinking and they're

960.319 --> 967.9699999999999
being pretty straightforward with it so

962.509 --> 970.069
that's kind of a relief I don't know I I

967.97 --> 972.799
got a better feeling about Infowars

970.069 --> 978.86
these days though there's still very

972.799 --> 983.269
tricky very sneaky still in a way very

978.86 --> 985.6
subtle and of course the balls and outer

983.269 --> 985.6
space

993.91 --> 996.6899999999999
anyway

1004.09 --> 1008.47
yeah the debates yesterday with the

1006.31 --> 1009.79
whole Coriolis effect just went off then

1008.47 --> 1015.64
on and on and on

1009.79 --> 1019.42
God that guy he just kept this

1015.64 --> 1022.53
comforting it was so clear-cut easy it's

1019.42 --> 1025.24
either either there is Coriolis effect

1022.53 --> 1028.1499999999999
okay because the atmosphere and the

1025.24 --> 1031.89
earth move separately separate reference

1028.15 --> 1034.8100000000002
frame or there isn't and he just kept on

1031.89 --> 1040.23
trying to declare that both could be

1034.81 --> 1043.23
present in the same scenario was just

1040.23 --> 1043.23
why

1050.45 --> 1057.16
and it wasn't Tommy thing

1052.61 --> 1061.75
let's not even start about Brenda that

1057.16 --> 1061.75
person is just so

1064.5 --> 1069.72
I don't know if she's it seems like a

1067.289 --> 1071.97
robot sometimes and when you really put

1069.72 --> 1075.8990000000001
on pressure she suddenly starts to

1071.97 --> 1077.789
switch like a lever and just suddenly

1075.899 --> 1081.9799999999998
make totally contradicting statements

1077.789 --> 1081.98
and then afterward

1088.96 --> 1095.08
yep it was the freakin internet

1091.76 --> 1095.08
connection again goody

1095.51 --> 1099.669
I think the stream isn't interrupted

1106.7 --> 1110.47
yep it's still going good

1124.1 --> 1131.99
you have to be quick I've way too long

1127.45 --> 1134.5
then yeah the video gets split off it's

1131.99 --> 1134.5
really annoying

1147.92 --> 1156.4
Juan Carlos sorry but yeah the Coriolis

1153.2 --> 1161.54
effect does exist it's only a matter of

1156.4 --> 1164.38
is the air layer moving separately from

1161.54 --> 1166.79
the supposed rotation of the earth

1164.38 --> 1170.0
because the Coriolis effect is a

1166.79 --> 1173.0
real-life optical phenomena when two

1170.0 --> 1175.7
separate reference frame move

1173.0 --> 1179.09
independently from each other that does

1175.7 --> 1184.91
exist it's a matter it doesn't exist on

1179.09 --> 1187.6899999999998
the earth or not really doesn't as for

1184.91 --> 1190.8100000000002
gravity that's a matter of perspective

1187.69 --> 1194.1100000000001
you're gonna look at it scientifically

1190.81 --> 1194.11
yeah that's

1194.32 --> 1206.11
that's a quick stop but yeah the

1200.11 --> 1211.2299999999998
aberration is still there so yeah and it

1206.11 --> 1211.2299999999998
does work mathematically so

1231.37 --> 1239.7299999999998
I'm looking to I'm never gonna give in

1235.66 --> 1241.93
to gravity allergy I just don't do it

1239.73 --> 1246.58
you're gonna have to deal with what it

1241.93 --> 1248.73
is and what it isn't and how it came to

1246.58 --> 1248.73
be

1308.94 --> 1312.44
that's right bill gee

1314.28 --> 1320.1
and there are no artillery or even

1317.91 --> 1324.71
ballistics instructions in how to deal

1320.1 --> 1324.7099999999998
with coriolis they don't exist

1327.59 --> 1333.82
because there is no Coriolis effect in

1331.28 --> 1337.43
the atmosphere in relation to the earth

1333.82 --> 1341.87
go steer at the stationary and so are

1337.43 --> 1344.72
the air layers except 40 very high wind

1341.87 --> 1347.6799999999998
streams which seem to be constantly

1344.72 --> 1347.68
there for some reason

1354.02 --> 1357.049
[Music]

1365.499 --> 1372.429
what's rude about eating in front of you

1368.679 --> 1372.429
it's a breakfast show

1373.32 --> 1380.57
and look if I got things to talk about

1378.6 --> 1385.86
our people to talk to

1380.57 --> 1388.6499999999999
yeah then then I'll be talking but yeah

1385.86 --> 1392.2199999999998
for now I don't really have a elaborate

1388.65 --> 1395.25
subject or anything so I'm just gonna

1392.22 --> 1398.42
eat my breakfast maybe talk to or

1395.25 --> 1398.42
address things in chat

1401.61 --> 1412.26
Yeah right afternoon it's afternoon in

1406.5 --> 1414.77
England Europe and in America it's early

1412.26 --> 1414.77
in the morning

1422.46 --> 1428.96
and the vast majority of flat-earthers

1424.409 --> 1428.96
still exists in the United States

1438.2 --> 1440.8300000000002
but down

1451.64 --> 1456.94
and command Voynich don't delete lotty

1462.49 --> 1466.33
just leave that to me

1476.08 --> 1482.31
noloty thank you I'm very fine I don't

1479.23 --> 1482.31
do not need your

1488.98 --> 1491.6100000000001
yeah

1491.75 --> 1496.48
tool modification help thank you very

1494.24 --> 1496.48
much

1549.96 --> 1557.43
a lot e is a is a classical troll with

1554.73 --> 1560.76
Fae moods and gets very nasty and

1557.43 --> 1563.49
perverted and otherwise it's just a more

1560.76 --> 1566.64
harmless troll so yeah you have to look

1563.49 --> 1568.91
see in a Fae mood it's just like with P

1566.64 --> 1568.91
Mars

1571.69 --> 1580.69
get who on the panel bride right sure

1578.29 --> 1584.26
look I'll have anyone on the panel but

1580.69 --> 1588.78
yeah they'd actually have to come on yes

1584.26 --> 1588.78
you are a lot II yes you are

1627.83 --> 1632.27
but

1629.43 --> 1632.27
anyway

1637.74 --> 1646.89
what you guys say weird things sometimes

1641.52 --> 1649.34
but oh yeah I put the panel link out in

1646.89 --> 1649.3400000000001
the open

1652.8 --> 1658.73
in the earlybird chat I can also put it

1662.65 --> 1667.5700000000002
in the master beat chef Nathan already

1665.35 --> 1668.9499999999998
put out his link so just confuse

1667.57 --> 1674.1899999999998
everyone and hopefully they'll

1668.95 --> 1674.19
accidentally come into my room and stay

1675.029 --> 1679.35
come on it's not that bad is it

1703.81 --> 1711.74
wait what what so

1708.26 --> 1714.22
what was embarrassing for Hari what

1711.74 --> 1714.22
happened

1740.299 --> 1743.799
you guys aren't

1744.16 --> 1747.96
not being very informative

1784.37 --> 1790.37
yeah hey II know you didn't they my

1789.38 --> 1793.19
coming through okay

1790.37 --> 1794.4089999999999
hey yeah I can hear you thanks for

1793.19 --> 1800.15
coming

1794.409 --> 1807.38
are you doing no no so bud well you're

1800.15 --> 1808.3700000000001
very low volume could be just me house

1807.38 --> 1812.48
on is on bail

1808.37 --> 1815.8899999999999
yeah alright yeah so so what's been

1812.48 --> 1820.01
having what you be looking into recently

1815.89 --> 1822.5900000000001
the whole I've been pretty much hard hit

1820.01 --> 1826.309
by the New Zealand situation and now and

1822.59 --> 1829.6399999999999
then you tracked right my home city here

1826.309 --> 1833.33
and yesterday apparently something

1829.64 --> 1835.22
happened in Belgium again the big city I

1833.33 --> 1836.9289999999999
think there was a bombing or something I

1835.22 --> 1839.809
don't know I just saw one little thing

1836.929 --> 1846.0700000000002
of it yesterday I haven't even dug into

1839.809 --> 1848.72
that because it's exercise attracted hmm

1846.07 --> 1850.97
yeah I held you and Reese talking about

1848.72 --> 1852.529
that they all know deal right they he

1850.97 --> 1855.1100000000001
was sort of given the Lord gave new his

1852.529 --> 1856.82
his protection with sport on that know

1855.11 --> 1859.309
everybody's cane they're coming out and

1856.82 --> 1862.6689999999999
talking about it how it sucks in almost

1859.309 --> 1865.7
be nuts I'm sorry I say again the last

1862.669 --> 1867.95
part I said no everybody's coming out

1865.7 --> 1871.909
and talking about as if it's a hawk some

1867.95 --> 1873.159
stuff like that so all right well that's

1871.909 --> 1880.0100000000002
to be expected

1873.159 --> 1883.0390000000002
and it's very insensitive in a way but

1880.01 --> 1888.82
can't be helped no actually it can be

1883.039 --> 1888.82
helped by ensuring that

1893.56 --> 1913.1499999999999
Loara can rinse anybody's better it

1908.62 --> 1914.4599999999998
should be better yeah okay no no more

1913.15 --> 1920.5600000000002
echo right

1914.46 --> 1924.43
so I told Reese what really needs to be

1920.56 --> 1928.0
done is to get in that mosque and get

1924.43 --> 1930.8500000000001
actual proof from somebody that I trust

1928.0 --> 1933.01
not from some fiafia source or through

1930.85 --> 1936.31
the media or through the police get

1933.01 --> 1938.35
footage of yeah bullet holes in the

1936.31 --> 1941.1399999999999
walls and the floor potentially

1938.35 --> 1943.6799999999998
bloodstains absorbed by the rock that

1941.14 --> 1947.0700000000002
kind of thing that that doesn't go away

1943.68 --> 1951.52
until the entire thing is completely

1947.07 --> 1954.9399999999998
restored basically rebuilt if they ever

1951.52 --> 1958.57
get to do that and not just a simple

1954.94 --> 1960.25
fixer up I don't know what they're gonna

1958.57 --> 1962.74
do with it and it all depends pretty

1960.25 --> 1965.55
much of that so if Reese wants to dispel

1962.74 --> 1969.6
all the [ __ ] and all these doubts

1965.55 --> 1971.71
then yeah if he could get that he could

1969.6 --> 1974.74
potentially show proof like yeah that

1971.71 --> 1978.3700000000001
[ __ ] really went down here here's the

1974.74 --> 1980.14
proof yeah by Wayne Allen you guarantee

1978.37 --> 1982.86
you know exactly what's gonna happen if

1980.14 --> 1985.39
he's dead go in there found the hole

1982.86 --> 1986.83
present in the proof it get cold an

1985.39 --> 1991.8400000000001
agent or something you know they're

1986.83 --> 1994.9299999999998
behind us - yeah better luck kill

1991.84 --> 1997.54
themselves I don't give a [ __ ] is real

1994.93 --> 1999.55
is real and it can be real and there's

1997.54 --> 2004.3799999999999
weird [ __ ] going on in the video for

1999.55 --> 2006.1499999999999
sure but ya know but you know that's

2004.38 --> 2009.3300000000002
gonna happen so sometimes are paying a

2006.15 --> 2011.73
one-dog I wonder whats or what's the

2009.33 --> 2015.54
what's the point of it I mean you're his

2011.73 --> 2018.03
mother already knows once some time [ __ ]

2015.54 --> 2019.11
really happens and that it's not all

2018.03 --> 2021.24
fake

2019.11 --> 2024.6
not every other you have an existence

2021.24 --> 2026.929
and I win dude I think it happened I've

2024.6 --> 2030.83
no doubt I know you know

2026.929 --> 2034.0990000000002
I don't know I think there's a big

2030.83 --> 2036.109
chance that it did happen but there's

2034.099 --> 2038.599
just these off things about it and I

2036.109 --> 2041.33
need proof and it's just suspicious all

2038.599 --> 2044.749
around from police and the Secret

2041.33 --> 2046.4289999999999
Service angle and that remains there was

2044.749 --> 2052.22
there from the start even Alex Jones

2046.429 --> 2055.7000000000003
addressed it okay so it's spooky and

2052.22 --> 2057.649
they would actually strike spelled the

2055.7 --> 2061.49
police would acts alone on exercises

2057.649 --> 2064.48
will believe up north and ISIL having an

2061.49 --> 2067.549
exercise in life that's why if this

2064.48 --> 2068.779
that's why they responded so quickly but

2067.549 --> 2070.639
Christie but all they do you want a neck

2068.779 --> 2072.97
so suddenly says I think it was the

2070.639 --> 2075.289
special you know discipline it up

2072.97 --> 2078.2599999999998
isn't that what always happens to it

2075.289 --> 2081.7400000000002
these cases they always have exercise in

2078.26 --> 2084.079
a drill yeah yeah it's so funny honest

2081.74 --> 2087.7299999999996
man I mean that's it's just so far like

2084.079 --> 2092.75
they are the odds of do not live is late

2087.73 --> 2095.539
9/11 then you hunted the one Madrid and

2092.75 --> 2097.279
London manga I'm sorry about this for

2095.539 --> 2099.38
decades but wait a minute

2097.279 --> 2101.029
but the thing is look what you do you

2099.38 --> 2104.619
still have telegram on it you still have

2101.029 --> 2107.329
to remember people gonna need people

2104.619 --> 2110.21
still dying they don't give a didn't

2107.329 --> 2112.2200000000003
kill a human life or that that all

2110.21 --> 2115.16
depends there are so many different type

2112.22 --> 2118.64
of scenarios sometimes it's just pure

2115.16 --> 2122.8689999999997
fear and emotional manipulation

2118.64 --> 2125.3289999999997
sometimes I mean we've seen medicine to

2122.869 --> 2128.299
just an act of violence night mill and I

2125.329 --> 2130.6400000000003
eat reject and sometimes I mean yeah

2128.299 --> 2133.309
[ __ ] does happen and there's a crazy guy

2130.64 --> 2136.089
and then there let's the crazy guy do

2133.309 --> 2138.289
the [ __ ] sometimes yes hand him the plan

2136.089 --> 2141.44
yes racist [ __ ] to do

2138.289 --> 2142.13
yes kami taking finally but that can

2141.44 --> 2145.609
happen as well

2142.13 --> 2148.13
there's so many different types of false

2145.609 --> 2148.93
flags levels from completely totally

2148.13 --> 2151.279
fake

2148.93 --> 2154.279
absolutely nothing what does that tell

2151.279 --> 2157.609
you there are no acts to which is our

2154.279 --> 2158.27
tale violent situations where there's

2157.609 --> 2160.85
been

2158.27 --> 2162.92
tinkering yeah but what does that tell

2160.85 --> 2164.36
you but what does that tell you they're

2162.92 --> 2166.7200000000003
not we will you just said they'll assume

2164.36 --> 2169.9100000000003
you've always had a question every event

2166.72 --> 2172.3999999999996
no well yeah of course but the point is

2169.91 --> 2173.69
is it really worth questioning it when

2172.4 --> 2176.9
you know you're never gonna find out the

2173.69 --> 2179.12
truth anyway that's true that's very

2176.9 --> 2182.4500000000003
good why would you say you're never

2179.12 --> 2184.49
gonna find out this got so much risk

2182.45 --> 2186.98
no you just meet a point near look only

2184.49 --> 2189.1099999999997
way you can really find out the hey the

2186.98 --> 2191.12
truth is Eisley being there i that

2189.11 --> 2193.7000000000003
taemin that's the whole truth and that

2191.12 --> 2195.5
would be out late so therefore if you

2193.7 --> 2197.48
accept in the first place i can look at

2195.5 --> 2200.06
let's find one I'm never gonna find out

2197.48 --> 2208.88
the truth because it's a it's virtually

2200.06 --> 2211.7599999999998
impossible so it's nice freaking show

2208.88 --> 2213.8
this is what your album you can just go

2211.76 --> 2218.8300000000004
[ __ ] yourself with me cuz I'm over here

2213.8 --> 2224.54
can't even smile like this is my show so

2218.83 --> 2225.02
you just let me finish with just let him

2224.54 --> 2231.38
finish

2225.02 --> 2234.59
come on I guess he left I would have but

2231.38 --> 2238.04
I was also making a pretty strong point

2234.59 --> 2239.81
that is that look with 911 yeah

2238.04 --> 2242.5099999999998
everybody good question was that add

2239.81 --> 2245.12
actually real and then you can go New

2242.51 --> 2248.3900000000003
York see a [ __ ] and I see yeah the

2245.12 --> 2251.2999999999997
building did go down maybe does no no

2248.39 --> 2255.62
yes yes you can actually confirm that

2251.3 --> 2259.8500000000004
physically by going there and that's my

2255.62 --> 2263.24
best we can do okay

2259.85 --> 2264.95
so may I ask can I admit can I ask you a

2263.24 --> 2267.79
question which I think he was alluding

2264.95 --> 2273.29
to sure

2267.79 --> 2275.7799999999997
now when it comes to people or groups

2273.29 --> 2280.55
thinking they are truthers when it comes

2275.78 --> 2286.9500000000003
to events such as 9/11 such as this do

2280.55 --> 2290.77
you really really believe that

2286.95 --> 2294.9399999999996
the absolute truth the hundred percent

2290.77 --> 2297.82
clear it's attainable by us the public

2294.94 --> 2302.65
the general do you think do you think

2297.82 --> 2305.7400000000002
attaining the truth is actually

2302.65 --> 2309.88
achievable for things like 9/11 and gas

2305.74 --> 2313.0299999999997
emission this yes really yes you think

2309.88 --> 2319.06
you're gonna know exactly who is

2313.03 --> 2321.4
involved yes yes yes yes yes yes

2319.06 --> 2324.82
the only problem is it's gonna take a

2321.4 --> 2327.31
lot of time true for always you know

2324.82 --> 2333.1600000000003
fall behind it takes time but yes

2327.31 --> 2337.72
absolutely yes it just takes a long time

2333.16 --> 2342.6299999999997
I have to get the right time the right

2337.72 --> 2344.8289999999997
testimonies the right in my sights

2342.63 --> 2349.27
people that worked on it

2344.829 --> 2352.48
in some way I disagree I think I think

2349.27 --> 2359.64
we can find truths but the truth the

2352.48 --> 2364.319
absolute book clothes was definitive I

2359.64 --> 2367.27
know I think that's what Ali was was

2364.319 --> 2370.81
alluding to I could be wrong and I want

2367.27 --> 2373.569
to speak for him but I just don't think

2370.81 --> 2376.69
it's possible not when it comes to

2373.569 --> 2378.73
things like this you know when it comes

2376.69 --> 2381.339
to objective reality like are you male

2378.73 --> 2384.76
or female yeah there's a that's an easy

2381.339 --> 2388.15
truth you know is this a fruit plant or

2384.76 --> 2390.13
is this a vegetable plant well is it

2388.15 --> 2393.46
flat you know things like that

2390.13 --> 2396.55
yeah but things like 9/11 I I think it's

2393.46 --> 2401.92
impossible no that's your problem

2396.55 --> 2403.8100000000004
I don't okay well how many years has it

2401.92 --> 2407.89
been since 9/11 and there's still no

2403.81 --> 2410.109
truth how many years since JFK how many

2407.89 --> 2412.39
years since the so-called landings how

2410.109 --> 2415.7799999999997
many years plenty of clearance it's just

2412.39 --> 2417.6299999999997
no recognition for yeah it's truths but

2415.78 --> 2418.96
no there's no you're not gonna get the

2417.63 --> 2422.109
t-h-e

2418.96 --> 2424.18
e truth sorry just like you're not gonna

2422.109 --> 2428.49
get the true and E's nobody move I don't

2424.18 --> 2431.74
care what is the truth hiring you I

2428.49 --> 2434.0499999999997
don't know oh oh yeah you're gonna ask

2431.74 --> 2438.0099999999998
for something that you don't even know

2434.05 --> 2440.38
what it actually members oh really so

2438.01 --> 2441.51
what does it mean then I'm not asking

2440.38 --> 2444.01
for the truth

2441.51 --> 2446.8300000000004
I'm not asking yeah but you are stating

2444.01 --> 2451.98
that it was possible to find the truth

2446.83 --> 2451.98
but you can't even define the truth

2452.13 --> 2457.3
what's the point

2453.67 --> 2460.42
uh yeah yeah that sounds kind of stupid

2457.3 --> 2463.42
really I mean if you want to be like P

2460.42 --> 2466.4500000000003
Mars and think that you know you believe

2463.42 --> 2470.14
in things but I just you know with it oh

2466.45 --> 2472.5299999999997
you know if you don't you going with

2470.14 --> 2477.2799999999997
belief or going with solipsistic

2472.53 --> 2481.69
implosion whatever you like oh whatever

2477.28 --> 2485.7400000000002
you want I know what I know okay please

2481.69 --> 2488.32
please please give me an ETA of when

2485.74 --> 2491.29

2488.32 --> 2494.5
truth of the mullah mining the truth of

2491.29 --> 2497.47
the JFK shooting the truth of the gulf

2494.5 --> 2501.97
of tonkin the truth of World War two

2497.47 --> 2505.0
from the truth how do you find whoever

2501.97 --> 2508.5099999999998
okay I don't care this time you have to

2505.0 --> 2514.78
find the parameters first before you lay

2508.51 --> 2519.73
out what I have to do it yeah yeah okay

2514.78 --> 2522.82
so what is how do you define the truth

2519.73 --> 2528.64
as in response to these events cause so

2522.82 --> 2532.96
much has been this does it actually

2528.64 --> 2535.75
admit it is that it Declassified is that

2532.96 --> 2540.19
the it is that the true authoring

2535.75 --> 2543.099
revealed is that a no not at all oh well

2540.19 --> 2544.75
what's the movie then we pretty much

2543.099 --> 2545.8590000000004
know what happened what's the point of

2544.75 --> 2547.599
looking for the dream

2545.859 --> 2549.13
what's the point of looking for the

2547.599 --> 2551.1400000000003
truth rather why don't you just

2549.13 --> 2552.31
understand how this world water standing

2551.14 --> 2554.56
what the [ __ ] is going

2552.31 --> 2557.2599999999998
nice and then this make your

2554.56 --> 2559.12
decision-making based on how things

2557.26 --> 2560.86
yeah what's good what's going on that's

2559.12 --> 2563.91
what it does it helps what skill

2560.86 --> 2568.7400000000002
knowledge in how to make wise decisions

2563.91 --> 2568.74
with the real thing what's going on

2570.3 --> 2575.17
what's going on and what's been

2572.95 --> 2577.5099999999998
happening for as pretty much as long as

2575.17 --> 2580.69
anybody can remember is pretty much

2577.51 --> 2584.46
every institution that runs this world

2580.69 --> 2586.78
is based on lies and narratives and and

2584.46 --> 2589.18
half-truths that's pretty much the

2586.78 --> 2591.9100000000003
pattern thing so when it comes to them

2589.18 --> 2594.46
selling you something you know take it

2591.91 --> 2599.89
with a grain of salt and understand the

2594.46 --> 2602.32
patterns yeah truth is just a exercise

2599.89 --> 2604.7799999999997
in futility but you know truthers and

2602.32 --> 2606.8500000000004
youtubers can evolve to adapt doesn't

2604.78 --> 2610.9
mean that it is that's over

2606.85 --> 2613.27
generalization yeah it's a

2610.9 --> 2617.55
generalization exactly doesn't matter to

2613.27 --> 2619.15
them it does to free human beings really

2617.55 --> 2623.17
people that don't

2619.15 --> 2626.23
yeah people but this is why we have real

2623.17 --> 2628.27
this is why we have institutions and an

2626.23 --> 2631.03
organized religion because people are

2628.27 --> 2633.55
people have a tendency to look for the

2631.03 --> 2635.4100000000003
truth what happens after Jed oh I don't

2633.55 --> 2649.78
know maybe maybe the Catholic Church has

2635.41 --> 2652.72
an answer they're looking for the truth

2649.78 --> 2654.88
and that's why they [ __ ] our slaves

2652.72 --> 2656.4399999999996
because they just look for the truth and

2654.88 --> 2659.2000000000003
they want an authority to give it to

2656.44 --> 2661.71
them so keep looking for the truth and

2659.2 --> 2664.62
keep having fun with false religions

2661.71 --> 2667.51
then that's not looking for the truth

2664.62 --> 2670.66
that's looking for it yes is that a

2667.51 --> 2672.73
getting satisfaction because of that why

2670.66 --> 2675.1
do you think normally why are you

2672.73 --> 2678.22
ignoring me with what I'm saying it's

2675.1 --> 2681.13
not looking for magic nor whatever going

2678.22 --> 2686.73
you're engaging you're engaging in an

2681.13 --> 2693.13
exercise that is just futile

2686.73 --> 2701.35
[ __ ] crap pattern recognition is far

2693.13 --> 2702.85
more useful than the truth does does

2701.35 --> 2708.3399999999997
that make any sense to you

2702.85 --> 2712.21
yeah but it's another side look if you

2708.34 --> 2714.55
don't have any anchor about what is true

2712.21 --> 2717.19
well it is well yeah and what are you

2714.55 --> 2719.11
doing everything becomes everything

2717.19 --> 2724.2400000000002
becomes science-fiction if you don't

2719.11 --> 2727.03
have an anchor in the end in the end you

2724.24 --> 2728.95
really care about the truth for example

2727.03 --> 2730.8100000000004
Christ Church or do you care about what

2728.95 --> 2735.21
the politicians are saying about how

2730.81 --> 2737.88
they're just clamping down on everything

2735.21 --> 2741.4
right

2737.88 --> 2746.5
that's yeah I'm or I'm working prints or

2741.4 --> 2749.6800000000003
both happens and both matters separately

2746.5 --> 2754.5
are you so angry because you keep on

2749.68 --> 2754.5
talking over me when it's given response

2754.59 --> 2759.84
no I asked you a question and you yell

2757.51 --> 2759.84
at me

2764.34 --> 2770.13
okay I just asked you a question and

2767.35 --> 2770.13
then you yelled at me

2773.5 --> 2786.96
so right it's okay I mean I mean no it's

2777.49 --> 2792.79
all good bro anyway so so is this your

2786.96 --> 2796.54
sort of focus of things of late I don't

2792.79 --> 2798.63
know this just is overcoming us yeah I'm

2796.54 --> 2801.31
trying to keep track of what's going on

2798.63 --> 2805.54
what the maneuvering is what politicians

2801.31 --> 2808.72
are trying to push through and in the

2805.54 --> 2812.2599999999998
Midlands that's happening that's like

2808.72 --> 2824.589
under big pressure and yeah France is

2812.26 --> 2827.0200000000004
even worse responses everywhere yeah

2824.589 --> 2829.72
pretty much and figuring out trying to

2827.02 --> 2831.64
get an oversight over what should we be

2829.72 --> 2836.02
doing because everybody is losing

2831.64 --> 2840.8799999999997
concentration because it is very

2836.02 --> 2843.849
complicated so I'm just trying to keep

2840.88 --> 2845.7400000000002
the focus and then putting that far

2843.849 --> 2850.619
these out there and it's very tough

2845.74 --> 2850.6189999999997
sometimes because I am I get overwhelmed

2851.61 --> 2859.71
yeah well try not to I know it can be

2854.67 --> 2863.01
hard but just I mean that's you you do

2859.71 --> 2864.96
recognize that's kind of where they want

2863.01 --> 2867.2700000000004
people that's the purpose of it is

2864.96 --> 2869.7
overwhelmed emotionally passion

2867.27 --> 2872.82
passionately and all that right yeah

2869.7 --> 2877.71
become basic that's what they're doing

2872.82 --> 2880.6200000000003
yeah that's right yeah okay I'm ready

2877.71 --> 2884.64
just cool glad you least recognize that

2880.62 --> 2887.1
just be aware of it and uh try not to

2884.64 --> 2890.3399999999997
fall instantly this is a constant focus

2887.1 --> 2893.73
doesn't because I am oversensitive

2890.34 --> 2896.6400000000003
so yeah I'm constantly like every second

2893.73 --> 2902.7
of my consciousness aware of that every

2896.64 --> 2905.2
second and it's my biggest discipline

2902.7 --> 2907.5989999999997
focus at the time

2905.2 --> 2911.5299999999997
because otherwise I'd be going nuts all

2907.599 --> 2914.829
the time and then lose track completely

2911.53 --> 2917.4100000000003
and kind of rage quit on everything

2914.829 --> 2920.65
again and I'm not gonna do that

2917.41 --> 2924.1299999999997
I don't plan to do that I don't want to

2920.65 --> 2927.94
do that I don't have to do that because

2924.13 --> 2932.589
I can't keep myself together although

2927.94 --> 2934.53
yes sometimes I do still have escapist

2932.589 --> 2937.5099999999998
tendencies those don't go away

2934.53 --> 2941.17
so I can keep myself under control but I

2937.51 --> 2944.6800000000003
will go into escapist mode and like play

2941.17 --> 2949.5
games and [ __ ] just to distract myself

2944.68 --> 2955.66
from the tension yeah I know I got you

2949.5 --> 2962.23
like I'm uh I guess I'm similar in that

2955.66 --> 2966.0989999999997
way I get very single-minded when I have

2962.23 --> 2971.309
a when I commit to something so yeah

2966.099 --> 2975.19
right now it's just pretty much business

2971.309 --> 2976.9
creativity work designed all that so I'm

2975.19 --> 2984.4
just I said I mean yeah the whole new

2976.9 --> 2988.839
stuff I'm pretty out of the loop right

2984.4 --> 2991.059
didn't imagine why because you'd be

2988.839 --> 2995.68
annoyed by almost everything that came

2991.059 --> 3001.349
into attention so so yeah yeah it's also

2995.68 --> 3006.5099999999998
about me but I am I concern myself with

3001.349 --> 3009.9900000000002
these things and I got you so good

3006.51 --> 3013.44
it's just you know where I am it's just

3009.99 --> 3017.45
this this news cycle doesn't have as

3013.44 --> 3021.559
much hoopla that it does in the in the

3017.45 --> 3024.1189999999997
whatever you want to call it the last

3021.559 --> 3026.13
the wet yeah the West the English

3024.119 --> 3028.5
whatever you want whatever it is right

3026.13 --> 3030.4100000000003
that's because the West still has some

3028.5 --> 3035.48
degree of freedom of speech

3030.41 --> 3038.24
and the whole amping it up extreme the

3035.48 --> 3040.07
other part of the competition and in

3038.24 --> 3048.0499999999997
China they don't need that because it is

3040.07 --> 3049.9100000000003
all just freakin media fascism ya know

3048.05 --> 3053.3
but even it's not just China it's just

3049.91 --> 3057.29
in Asia like whatever Japan craziest

3053.3 --> 3061.61
they don't have this they don't have

3057.29 --> 3063.83
this not just specifically these these

3061.61 --> 3067.51
news events but they don't have this you

3063.83 --> 3073.0099999999998
know multicultural diversity

3067.51 --> 3076.03
stuff you know it's Japan is Japan and

3073.01 --> 3082.2200000000003
they don't have these issues about

3076.03 --> 3085.03
inclusivity and gender and and of course

3082.22 --> 3088.1
then there's the you know the Western

3085.03 --> 3090.01
you know that's funny why is this minor

3088.1 --> 3095.8399999999997
that why are these things not happening

3090.01 --> 3100.6000000000004
in the Asiatic because they rejected the

3095.84 --> 3103.19
effort because they reject it outright

3100.6 --> 3105.98
no more I'm talking about these these

3103.19 --> 3110.57
violence but to say these violent things

3105.98 --> 3112.82
like why they happening here because

3110.57 --> 3120.4100000000003
people have become irrationally tolerant

3112.82 --> 3123.02
here they can come culture they've

3120.41 --> 3126.17
become culturally and is that just a

3123.02 --> 3129.05
narrative in the social engineering

3126.17 --> 3132.4700000000003
that's on the playbook for the so-called

3129.05 --> 3136.52
West you know yes Chuck why it's trouble

3132.47 --> 3139.2099999999996
it's how we've been raised the way the

3136.52 --> 3142.39
message constantly has been echoing

3139.21 --> 3145.61
basically making us surrender into a

3142.39 --> 3147.47
dream of good hope and trust and

3145.61 --> 3151.75
everything just being becoming

3147.47 --> 3157.1499999999996
ultimately a naive and that's the spell

3151.75 --> 3157.15
that's the spell they put on people here

3164.169 --> 3171.3799999999997
yeah it's it's it's crazy you know it's

3167.599 --> 3175.299
I get I guess you you pretty much grew

3171.38 --> 3177.559
up posts I guess you're a post or

3175.299 --> 3183.169
whatever you call it 9/11 generation

3177.559 --> 3185.9190000000003
pretty much whereas I was a from the

3183.169 --> 3185.919
Cold War

3186.249 --> 3194.959
yeah but you're born born in the

3188.63 --> 3200.63
eighties right 1980 1980 okay yeah I'm

3194.959 --> 3208.9089999999997
yeah that's your during the heyday you

3200.63 --> 3211.599
look or see ya know 9/11 happened when I

3208.909 --> 3211.599
was 21

3212.049 --> 3222.589
yeah wow man you you were you do age

3216.589 --> 3226.009
well kudos I don't age at all you don't

3222.589 --> 3228.019
eat you just suck at that it's a grass

3226.009 --> 3235.36
from from 20 years ago

3228.019 --> 3237.64
I'm serious it's barely any difference

3235.36 --> 3241.0
skin is pretty much the same that's cool

3237.64 --> 3244.06
no extra wrinkles comparatively yeah my

3241.0 --> 3246.52
hair has become slightly thinner it's

3244.06 --> 3249.7
not even like it's moving back it's just

3246.52 --> 3252.88
thinner that was to be expected I've got

3249.7 --> 3254.85
my hair for my mother and for Cathy not

3252.88 --> 3257.35
my father

3254.85 --> 3262.54

not trying to piss you off or anything

3297.39 --> 3306.9
yeah so what's going on with Ali B

3303.52 --> 3309.52
though you know I hope he doesn't know

3306.9 --> 3312.85
think I'm some kind of dick or something

3309.52 --> 3316.24
I just did did you did you kick him ever

3312.85 --> 3320.83
he did he quit no he's still in the back

3316.24 --> 3323.77
yeah no he he just left because yeah

3320.83 --> 3326.68
okay he thought he had the right that's

3323.77 --> 3329.7599999999998
like what to overtalk me and nobody does

3326.68 --> 3333.25
that on my shows just very simple so you

3329.76 --> 3336.9700000000003
I didn't kick anyone no he just left

3333.25 --> 3338.98
but I went angry at him and told him you

3336.97 --> 3341.6499999999996
don't over talk me this is my show and

3338.98 --> 3345.729
he didn't accept it so he got all pissy

3341.65 --> 3348.9790000000003
you said [ __ ] you and then that

3345.729 --> 3357.5589999999997
so I guess he wasn't in all too good of

3348.979 --> 3360.14
a mood himself yeah I have noticed since

3357.559 --> 3361.67
I've been over here like let's say let's

3360.14 --> 3366.769
just say the new year

3361.67 --> 3371.539
but it's a lot of people in the flat

3366.769 --> 3375.229
earth have been a lot of drama I mean he

3371.539 --> 3378.0190000000002
had that what Pancho key and Jose switch

3375.229 --> 3385.279
you know I'm going to what I don't know

3378.019 --> 3387.14
I mean just know yeah all right well

3385.279 --> 3391.189
that's kind of normal though it's the

3387.14 --> 3393.89
winter period you might remember that

3391.189 --> 3397.7889999999998
pretty much happened every single year

3393.89 --> 3400.8799999999997
and maybe nothing so such an extent as

3397.789 --> 3404.329
it has no but with other people things

3400.88 --> 3409.099
happen you always a [ __ ] happens during

3404.329 --> 3411.829
the winter well I shouldn't mean it's

3409.099 --> 3413.179
been new new year I mean almost you know

3411.829 --> 3420.38
spring and it just seems like it's

3413.179 --> 3425.349
getting not whatever but you know me and

3420.38 --> 3428.839
I was never really a flat earther I

3425.349 --> 3432.1090000000004
don't care not a baller though by the

3428.839 --> 3434.869
way just for the record I really don't

3432.109 --> 3437.239
care I think space is still gay so

3434.869 --> 3439.509
anybody's listening space is gay quote

3437.239 --> 3439.509
me on that

3440.41 --> 3445.839
space it's gay so it's a missed and

3443.869 --> 3449.4790000000003
stupidest thing I've ever it's out of my

3445.839 --> 3452.0589999999997
six it's a great sign space it's a great

3449.479 --> 3454.939
science make you medium nice great it's

3452.059 --> 3456.7290000000003
a great story but it's just reality be

3454.939 --> 3460.7889999999998
gay just because it's science fiction

3456.729 --> 3463.64
well listen I'm a sci-fi fan and I own

3460.789 --> 3465.7690000000002
like my gayness and outside of its gay

3463.64 --> 3466.779
so you're basically saying your game

3465.769 --> 3469.549
okay

3466.779 --> 3471.469
yellow gay is you know nerds are gay

3469.549 --> 3474.89
okay people who play dungeon trackage

3471.469 --> 3479.12
that's also gay excuse me No

3474.89 --> 3481.4
you know when I say mastery is amazing

3479.12 --> 3483.2
it's not gay there's only one personal

3481.4 --> 3488.81
that you could consider to be in that

3483.2 --> 3492.1899999999996
case okay you're defining gay as sexual

3488.81 --> 3498.47
I just mean it's not manly

3492.19 --> 3504.35
it's not like like longer Jack like

3498.47 --> 3506.4199999999996
Lumberjacks are so not gay I know a lot

3504.35 --> 3510.3199999999997
of gay people that would say that's

3506.42 --> 3512.51
wrong see you what do you mean get you

3510.32 --> 3517.2400000000002
made homosexual speaking queers that's

3512.51 --> 3520.0400000000004
that's queer I'm just okay spaces gay

3517.24 --> 3524.87
like I know it doesn't I know in the

3520.04 --> 3530.21
olden days gay meat meant happy but he's

3524.87 --> 3532.7
happier he owes name is Derek it's a

3530.21 --> 3535.58
hundred years later now doesn't it mean

3532.7 --> 3539.27
the same thing my mind gauges in my mind

3535.58 --> 3543.95
gays just like not really manly not like

3539.27 --> 3552.64
really that cool doesn't mean has

3543.95 --> 3559.16
nothing to do with sexuality yeah yeah

3552.64 --> 3560.96
and you so what's your uh your clientele

3559.16 --> 3564.16
on your show is it still a lot of

3560.96 --> 3570.82
flattered that you're just kind of more

3564.16 --> 3570.8199999999997
social current well that must

3575.15 --> 3585.359
our wind and our Winston dragons friend

3579.829 --> 3587.4
hilarious it's good timing like somebody

3585.359 --> 3589.95
brought out their sock when I mentioned

3587.4 --> 3592.309
that again and I kind of appreciate that

3589.95 --> 3596.16
love that kind of trolling that's like

3592.309 --> 3600.48
more art form of trolling than just

3596.16 --> 3603.1499999999996
being a pain in the ass but look I

3600.48 --> 3605.16
talked about anything and I'm really

3603.15 --> 3607.9500000000003
surprised that we don't get to talk more

3605.16 --> 3611.43
about Flat Earth really because people

3607.95 --> 3613.1699999999996
are not really joining for that always

3611.43 --> 3615.0589999999997
asking other questions and then during

3613.17 --> 3616.71
the debates everybody's all flat earth

3615.059 --> 3620.94
and everything about Flat Earth and

3616.71 --> 3623.46
apparently they just save their flat

3620.94 --> 3627.48
earthiness up for the debates or

3623.46 --> 3630.02
something because I bet you get to talk

3627.48 --> 3635.48
about it kind of make sense

3630.02 --> 3639.599
you know I'm not surprised really so I

3635.48 --> 3642.119
mean whatever you think about delis you

3639.599 --> 3644.73
know I had a lot of drama but one thing

3642.119 --> 3646.349
I agree it's like it's really not a

3644.73 --> 3651.03
debate I mean sorry Nathan

3646.349 --> 3653.94
Adele is is drama everything he does is

3651.03 --> 3658.92
drama literally the classical definition

3653.94 --> 3661.92
of drama he's making a scene literally

3658.92 --> 3671.16
and figuratively and that's what he does

3661.92 --> 3674.04
yeah yeah indeed that's for sure but ya

3671.16 --> 3675.3289999999997
know it does what he does it's kind of

3674.04 --> 3680.089
funny

3675.329 --> 3682.7690000000002
there's amusement value to it and I

3680.089 --> 3685.049
don't really follow him anymore

3682.769 --> 3686.8489999999997
sometimes he just pops in the attention

3685.049 --> 3690.479
because he went head-on with somebody

3686.849 --> 3692.9990000000003
there's some kind of mistake an

3690.479 --> 3696.029
interpretation situation like with Riley

3692.999 --> 3700.009
or where Riley's trapped that was kind

3696.029 --> 3703.739
of funny yeah what happened with um

3700.009 --> 3706.349
Russian vids like he was on a vegan boys

3703.739 --> 3708.059
show maybe two months ago and I heard

3706.349 --> 3710.009
that he's supposedly know it but then I

3708.059 --> 3712.739
still hear that he's doing other

3710.009 --> 3715.919
people's hangout so he did he quit or

3712.739 --> 3718.979
did he not quit that's my went on

3715.919 --> 3725.249
Patricia's not too long ago like a month

3718.979 --> 3733.019
or something exactly so but he made a

3725.249 --> 3736.859
video quit then yeah so it was like he

3733.019 --> 3738.8089999999997
was quitting like makings so I guess he

3736.859 --> 3741.419
quit making stuff but he's still on

3738.809 --> 3747.659
YouTube and hang out so I'm alright I

3741.419 --> 3750.589
