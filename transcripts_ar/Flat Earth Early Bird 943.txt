135.52 --> 138.4
a little bit warmer

140.08 --> 145.44000000000003
and a little less moist let me check

152.04 --> 156.48
[Applause]

154.84 --> 159.84
that

156.48 --> 164.16
yeah 24 degrees celsius

159.84 --> 169.519
56 humidity ah

164.16 --> 171.84
nice hello agm first in chat good to see

169.519 --> 171.84
you

178.319 --> 199.83999999999997
it is saturday the 3rd

182.8 --> 199.84
of july 2021

202.159 --> 207.2
and yeah i think things are pretty good

208.959 --> 213.36
although i am having kind of like a just

212.159 --> 217.28
a real laid back

213.36 --> 220.4
mood since i recovered from my jaw

217.28 --> 220.4
situation it's like

220.72 --> 227.2
eager to sleep at times so i don't know

224.48 --> 229.599
i feel like i got some rest to catch up

227.2 --> 233.04
to it's weird

229.599 --> 234.319
during night times i don't sleep that

233.04 --> 237.439
super long but

234.319 --> 237.439
yeah i get like

237.68 --> 243.04000000000002
mini naps throughout the day it's weird

240.319 --> 246.159
i don't know i have that sometimes

243.04 --> 247.92
it does feel really good though

246.159 --> 250.39999999999998
but i think it's part of the recovery

247.92 --> 250.39999999999998
process

251.28 --> 254.319
i get the feeling like it makes me a

253.36 --> 257.35900000000004
little slow

254.319 --> 258.56
though afterward when i watch back a

257.359 --> 260.479
hangout

258.56 --> 261.68
like i've watched back yesterday's hang

260.479 --> 266.32
out too

261.68 --> 269.759
then it's not slow it it kind of isn't

266.32 --> 272.24
so sometimes when i feel slow maybe it's

269.759 --> 272.8
my mind actually being faster than the

272.24 --> 275.84000000000003
normal

272.8 --> 278.08
procedure of time and that i experience

275.84 --> 281.28
it as slow

278.08 --> 284.639
so i feel slow but i'm not slow

281.28 --> 287.11999999999995
it's odd whatever

284.639 --> 289.36
uh hey hello dutch sailor good to see

287.12 --> 289.36
you

291.52 --> 294.79999999999995
yeah it was great having you guys in

293.199 --> 297.84000000000003
chat

294.8 --> 301.52000000000004
it's been a lot of fun and it's been

297.84 --> 304.08
interesting having you in the chat

301.52 --> 304.08
all of you

305.28 --> 309.28
i really feel like we're getting

306.8 --> 312.16
somewhere

309.28 --> 314.08
with the show when that happens i really

312.16 --> 316.32000000000005
appreciate that

314.08 --> 316.32
uh

318.24 --> 322.24
so yeah yesterday i've been watching

320.0 --> 325.039
more old benjamin

322.24 --> 325.84000000000003
finish that up before i started watching

325.039 --> 329.28
this

325.84 --> 329.28
before i started up my show

329.68 --> 335.28000000000003
uh that's some really fascinating ideas

335.44 --> 338.96
he made this analogy of a propaganda

338.479 --> 342.479
engine

338.96 --> 342.479
and an actual pressure

342.96 --> 348.0
system in engineering that was really

350.84 --> 353.84
smart

359.36 --> 362.72
and yeah i definitely get the feeling

361.12 --> 364.56
that home benjamin and

362.72 --> 368.08000000000004
other people too but a benjamin

364.56 --> 372.24
especially he's like really digging

368.08 --> 375.59999999999997
and building his way through esoterics

372.24 --> 376.08
and i just get a strong sensation that

375.6 --> 381.84000000000003
he

376.08 --> 381.84
really gets it because

382.56 --> 390.639
yeah it's very tough to correct him

387.039 --> 391.039
on on mistakes because he barely makes

390.639 --> 395.84000000000003
any

391.039 --> 395.84
like in the context of what he's doing

397.84 --> 402.08
i mean there is still a human being

400.16 --> 404.24
every every human being

402.08 --> 405.199
has like other sides to them and they

404.24 --> 408.40000000000003
deal with it and

405.199 --> 412.08000000000004
or they don't and he does just

408.4 --> 414.31899999999996
fantastic it's really impressive

412.08 --> 414.31899999999996
uh

417.919 --> 426.0
right so also watched more

422.88 --> 426.0
the hobbit movies

426.16 --> 433.28000000000003
and in the last movie i kind of have to

429.919 --> 436.639
because i in the second movie

433.28 --> 440.4
like legolas dad is kind of gay

436.639 --> 444.0
but then in the movie that follows it up

440.4 --> 448.15999999999997
it does kind of like

444.0 --> 451.44
puts down a bit of the mask of his act

448.16 --> 452.24
and then it becomes more clear like yeah

451.44 --> 456.24
who this guy

452.24 --> 458.96000000000004
is why he's like that and he's less gay

456.24 --> 459.52
also he rides one hell of a moose that's

458.96 --> 462.71999999999997
or

459.52 --> 467.599
what is it a giant reindeer

462.72 --> 467.59900000000005
that looks epic anyway

469.68 --> 479.84000000000003
wait what is that

486.94 --> 492.16
[Music]

488.08 --> 494.87899999999996
yeah yeah of course dutch sailor yeah

492.16 --> 498.0
i still remember that that when he first

494.879 --> 500.8
dug into that stuff that's

498.0 --> 501.36
when he caught my attention and i kind

500.8 --> 507.84000000000003
of

501.36 --> 507.84000000000003
hung around ever since

508.319 --> 512.32
and he was very interactive with chad

510.72 --> 516.0
always still is but he now

512.32 --> 521.36
has his own confined chat

516.0 --> 524.08
carefully moderated too yeah

521.36 --> 526.32
but yeah it was great like being able to

524.08 --> 528.1600000000001
interact with him too

526.32 --> 529.6
just me doing my thing in chat and

528.16 --> 531.36
really trying to

529.6 --> 533.519
put a lot of things together in just a

531.36 --> 535.839
couple of words and to reflect

533.519 --> 535.839
the thought

537.279 --> 541.68
it was just really a fascinating

539.2 --> 545.6
experience

541.68 --> 548.3199999999999
it got such a feeling of like palpable

545.6 --> 548.8000000000001
interaction between the spirits it was

548.32 --> 551.36
just

548.8 --> 551.3599999999999
amazing

557.44 --> 563.839
and yeah just saw how we just open up to

560.08 --> 563.839
a lot of things

574.48 --> 580.5600000000001
right indeed and it's also

578.24 --> 582.64
i find it just fascinating like how he

580.56 --> 586.3199999999999
does or how he deals with

582.64 --> 588.959
gammas and trolls that's also

586.32 --> 589.44
inspired me a lot because before i got

588.959 --> 592.56
to

589.44 --> 595.9200000000001
know him and basically see what he does

592.56 --> 599.4399999999999
that trolls

595.92 --> 600.56
really frustrated me like i took it

599.44 --> 603.2790000000001
personal

600.56 --> 606.8
it drew me out of control when it

603.279 --> 610.88
happened and he really kind of showed me

606.8 --> 612.02
that you can just do something creative

610.88 --> 613.279
with it instead

612.02 --> 618.8
[Music]

613.279 --> 622.72
and that really inspired me to really

618.8 --> 622.7199999999999
yeah to get over it to

624.32 --> 633.2
build a system for it and now i still

627.839 --> 636.0
apply that to this day

633.2 --> 638.32
but yeah that that was definitely

636.0 --> 642.32
inspired by him

638.32 --> 645.6800000000001
by his creative social interactions

642.32 --> 647.839
uh should never drop the keyboard piano

645.68 --> 647.8389999999999
what

649.76 --> 653.76
nobody doesn't he doesn't drop it

655.36 --> 661.839
he just has to be in the mood for it

674.48 --> 678.48
just like my intro for this hangout

684.16 --> 688.8
the key the intro is the key for this

686.72 --> 691.6800000000001
hangout well it is the

688.8 --> 694.24
yeah the intro it is the song it is the

691.68 --> 694.2399999999999
the tune

699.519 --> 707.12
but home benjamin just live plays stuff

704.72 --> 708.0
he's really putting down his mastery and

707.12 --> 712.48
like

708.0 --> 717.839
basically also tries to teach

712.48 --> 717.839
how to do it

718.48 --> 731.839
you need to find the right words

732.32 --> 738.88
well when it comes to intros song

735.04 --> 738.88
especially but also visuals

739.279 --> 743.6
it's all about what frequencies do you

741.279 --> 745.519
want to hit

743.6 --> 749.0400000000001
what dreams do you want to touch and

745.519 --> 749.04
which ones do you want to avoid

750.72 --> 753.76
and how will they cross interact and

752.72 --> 759.839
then just

753.76 --> 759.8389999999999
yeah navigate

761.839 --> 768.24
just like an adventurer

765.2 --> 772.32
ah man yeah watching the hobbit

768.24 --> 775.2
movies it's weird

772.32 --> 776.8000000000001
i'm seeing them back they're better than

775.2 --> 780.0
i remember them

776.8 --> 781.92
i think i was feeling in a very colored

780.0 --> 784.56
way

781.92 --> 787.4399999999999
and they are their own thing they are

784.56 --> 790.959
their own creation

787.44 --> 794.1600000000001
i originally the hobbit book

790.959 --> 796.88
it was read to me as a little kid i was

794.16 --> 799.279
very inspired by it

796.88 --> 800.0
but it also had like the child mindset

799.279 --> 802.8
for it at the

800.0 --> 803.92
time the lord of the rings is much more

802.8 --> 807.04
adult

803.92 --> 808.7199999999999
than that much more about the burden

807.04 --> 813.04
carrying burden

808.72 --> 815.519
just yeah that adulthood in many ways

813.04 --> 817.279
take getting serious in life it's a

815.519 --> 818.32
responsibility for yourself and

817.279 --> 820.399
everybody

818.32 --> 823.44
everything you appreciate defending it

820.399 --> 823.44
etc etc

823.519 --> 826.88
and the hobbit is much more of a wild

825.279 --> 829.279
adventure

826.88 --> 830.399
and and yeah looking back on it when you

829.279 --> 834.8
read it

830.399 --> 834.8
it's it's kind of goofy

835.6 --> 840.0
like and in the original writing it's

837.6 --> 842.72
like every dwarf has another color beard

840.0 --> 845.12
and [ __ ] it's like it's kind of goofy

842.72 --> 846.639
but the movie they made out of it is

845.12 --> 849.12
kind of like they try to

846.639 --> 850.88
update that into me it's more serious

849.12 --> 854.079
making it more serious

850.88 --> 856.959
and that does work

854.079 --> 858.16
i appreciate in that sense the movies

856.959 --> 860.2399999999999
they made out of it

858.16 --> 862.639
more than the original book although the

860.24 --> 866.399
original book is just kind of yeah it's

862.639 --> 869.279
for kids it's for the really young ones

866.399 --> 871.6
wouldn't recommend the movie for really

869.279 --> 872.48
young ones because it's yeah very bloody

871.6 --> 876.48
and [ __ ]

872.48 --> 876.48
right uh

882.079 --> 888.4799999999999
right but they got the music right

885.199 --> 888.8
in it they really did a superb job with

888.48 --> 891.6800000000001
it

888.8 --> 895.4399999999999
you know all of the movies they really

891.68 --> 895.4399999999999
kept to the lord of the rings style

897.04 --> 900.8
and yeah sometimes i think about it like

900.16 --> 903.92
yeah it's

900.8 --> 906.88
it's too much action almost it's almost

903.92 --> 906.88
too much action

907.04 --> 912.079
too many like ooh look at special boy

910.079 --> 915.3599999999999
moves and

912.079 --> 918.399
making it into like this bouncing ball

915.36 --> 920.5600000000001
near superhero experience

918.399 --> 922.079
that part i think is like yeah come on

920.56 --> 925.279
guys

922.079 --> 928.959
you know when [ __ ] hits the fan and

925.279 --> 933.759
the action burst yeah that's cool but

928.959 --> 938.6389999999999
during like a quarter of the scenes

933.759 --> 940.8000000000001
like constant it's it got tiring

938.639 --> 942.5600000000001
in all the movies it kind of got tired

940.8 --> 945.7589999999999
maybe in the last one because it is

942.56 --> 950.399
really like a giant war and

945.759 --> 950.399
that really worked in retrospect

951.68 --> 955.519
maybe if you just watch all the movies

954.8 --> 957.8389999999999
in in

955.519 --> 960.16
sequence after one another then it would

957.839 --> 961.839
be like too tiresome

960.16 --> 963.759
to still see the third movie i had the

961.839 --> 966.399
same issue with the lord of the rings

963.759 --> 968.32
like because it's all too much if you

966.399 --> 970.16
just watch it separately with time in

968.32 --> 973.519
between

970.16 --> 973.519
yeah then the last one is

976.0 --> 979.759
in ways i guess my favorite

981.6 --> 988.639
because it's like really interesting war

984.959 --> 988.6389999999999
combat between two

988.8 --> 993.5999999999999
groups and their styles very much a lot

992.56 --> 997.199
of detail in it

993.6 --> 998.48
it's it's pretty much as epic maybe even

997.199 --> 1000.7199999999999
more interesting than

998.48 --> 1002.639
like the lord of the rings final battles

1000.72 --> 1006.8000000000001
and stuff anyway

1002.639 --> 1006.8
right so yeah lord of the rings i'm

1006.88 --> 1011.759

1072.08 --> 1074.6399999999999
completely

1074.799 --> 1083.44
when elrond raddagast

1080.16 --> 1085.6000000000001
gandalf and

1251.6 --> 1263.84
it could get like cross wired and then

1255.52 --> 1263.84
it'll yeah that could definitely happen

1274.84 --> 1277.84
so

1288.84 --> 1291.84
so

1298.48 --> 1302.32

flat earth recent events

1344.32 --> 1352.799
like baller projects

1347.84 --> 1352.799
space [ __ ] that is planned whatever

1358.84 --> 1361.84
anything

1372.84 --> 1375.84
huh

1376.88 --> 1382.72
by the way i can't say enough how much

1379.679 --> 1385.039
of a joy it has been

1382.72 --> 1385.919
to literally go out for groceries again

1385.039 --> 1388.799
and just see

1385.919 --> 1390.64
almost nobody wear a mask i really

1388.799 --> 1394.72
really like it

1390.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
and the ones that do they all look

1394.72 --> 1403.84
like they're not in good shape

1403.919 --> 1408.0
like they're they've been touched by

1406.48 --> 1411.039
fear so it's

1408.0 --> 1413.36
it's really telling but it's very few

1411.039 --> 1413.36
people

1414.96 --> 1420.24
like old people neither like

1418.159 --> 1422.24
plenty of old people without masks

1420.24 --> 1424.32
walking around like even walking sticks

1422.24 --> 1427.76
and [ __ ] just like no mask and like

1424.32 --> 1430.3999999999999
yeah yeah

1427.76 --> 1431.2
i never thought i would get so much joy

1430.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
of just

1431.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
being able to see people's faces

1453.84 --> 1460.6399999999999
christian hermeticism

1456.96 --> 1462.159
oh right rasta yeah yeah you did post

1460.64 --> 1465.2
that video

1462.159 --> 1466.48
i watched a bit of it and it gave me

1465.2 --> 1469.6000000000001
such a headache that

1466.48 --> 1472.32
i discontinued

1469.6 --> 1474.3999999999999
like that was one of the most artistic

1472.32 --> 1477.6789999999999
presentations i've ever seen about an

1474.4 --> 1477.679
ethereal subject

1478.3 --> 1481.369
[Music]

1485.36 --> 1489.9189999999999
you put up some topic yeah yeah i heard

1487.76 --> 1489.919
ya

1491.12 --> 1495.4399999999998
don't know why we talk about 10th man

1493.52 --> 1498.84
though

1495.44 --> 1500.72
is that really something we need to talk

1498.84 --> 1503.9189999999999
about

1500.72 --> 1503.919
maybe you feel the need

1505.52 --> 1509.76
you just linked a short one okay

1511.039 --> 1520.0
well that's that it all felt

1515.44 --> 1520.0
super exoteric day it it's like

1520.72 --> 1523.76
it was such a

1524.08 --> 1530.48
skeletal frame idea it barely

1527.6 --> 1530.48
touched anything

1539.279 --> 1546.88
like none of it gave me the feeling

1543.44 --> 1550.24
that there was some kind of insight into

1546.88 --> 1553.44
what christian people

1550.24 --> 1554.0
actually believe like how the how the

1553.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
belief

1554.0 --> 1557.84
drives them

1558.08 --> 1564.6399999999999
like yeah there were

1561.84 --> 1566.24
technical involved words mentioned and

1564.64 --> 1570.4
grouped and

1566.24 --> 1573.44
ordered it's just it didn't

1570.4 --> 1576.159
prove that they actually

1573.44 --> 1579.279
understood the material they just

1576.159 --> 1579.279
determinated it

1583.2 --> 1587.3600000000001
just dissecting that that's it they

1585.6 --> 1599.84
didn't understand it that's the feeling

1587.36 --> 1599.84
i got from that video

1602.4 --> 1605.2
hey clutch bear

1607.6 --> 1613.84
wandering earth

1614.72 --> 1618.4
wondering it's a chinese production

1617.52 --> 1622.8799999999999
producer

1618.4 --> 1625.2
okay i i'm wait is that the one

1622.88 --> 1627.8400000000001
where they literally have to migrate the

1625.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
planet earth

1628.4 --> 1634.5590000000002
and then eventually and end up blowing

1631.6 --> 1634.559
it up or something

1635.279 --> 1638.48
i think i saw that one

1638.559 --> 1644.0
some time ago like two years ago

1640.799 --> 1644.0
unbelievable productions

1653.039 --> 1656.72
well okay stop the traffic i'm arrested

1655.2 --> 1658.799
well if that video

1656.72 --> 1661.52
was meant to get me to look into

1658.799 --> 1664.24
christian hermeticism

1661.52 --> 1666.0
it was not very functional because i did

1664.24 --> 1668.08
not get the impulse to look into

1666.0 --> 1670.88
christian hermeticism because i

1668.08 --> 1673.1999999999998
thought it was all just skeletal

1670.88 --> 1675.44
exoteric

1673.2 --> 1678.64
stuff that didn't prove they actually

1675.44 --> 1678.64
understood anything about

1680.84 --> 1684.8799999999999
christians

1682.08 --> 1684.8799999999999
how they think

1685.52 --> 1691.6
but look if you got a better example

1689.039 --> 1693.36
i'll check it out i got my skype off by

1691.6 --> 1696.48
the way right now because otherwise i'm

1693.36 --> 1699.6
gonna constantly get those pop-up noises

1696.48 --> 1699.6
and i don't like that

1708.84 --> 1711.84
okay

1712.64 --> 1716.3990000000001
look if there was something that

1713.919 --> 1719.5200000000002
particularly inspired you

1716.399 --> 1725.84
to think it of being great

1719.52 --> 1725.84
then just direct me to that part

1726.32 --> 1729.279
and i'll check it out

1732.399 --> 1739.84
christian hermeticism okay

1740.72 --> 1747.1200000000001
all right well in that case rasta hat

1744.64 --> 1748.0800000000002
then it's literally just bringing up a

1747.12 --> 1752.8799999999999
new thing

1748.08 --> 1755.6789999999999
that i don't know anything about

1752.88 --> 1756.65
christian hermet you know what i'll

1755.679 --> 1759.52
google it

1756.65 --> 1761.3600000000001
[Music]

1759.52 --> 1763.12
i guess that where the movie failed to

1761.36 --> 1766.399
make me look it up

1763.12 --> 1769.6
you succeeded makes

1766.399 --> 1770.9599999999998
you more effective than that video you

1769.6 --> 1781.84
showed me

1770.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
hey getting wisdom good to see you

1787.44 --> 1791.8400000000001
reaction to protestant reformation

1793.12 --> 1797.4399999999998
what uh believed that

1802.48 --> 1809.84
okay so it is literally about her

1805.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
mystery magusus

1810.24 --> 1814.76
right well i am not specifically a

1813.919 --> 1820.0
christian

1814.76 --> 1820.0
hermeticist but i do find

1820.84 --> 1825.6
the

1823.039 --> 1826.48
at least at least an attempt or an

1825.6 --> 1829.9189999999999
indication

1826.48 --> 1829.919
of fractal thinking

1830.08 --> 1835.279
within the yeah within that book

1833.12 --> 1836.799
that i read that's supposed to be

1835.279 --> 1841.12
written by him

1836.799 --> 1844.6399999999999
so i do find it very interesting

1841.12 --> 1847.1999999999998
but i'm not like oh i am a follower of

1844.64 --> 1847.2
that guy

1848.84 --> 1854.0
no

1850.88 --> 1855.6000000000001
i do not fully understand him enough in

1854.0 --> 1859.039
order to do that

1855.6 --> 1859.039
to decide to do that

1862.24 --> 1871.6
this definite flair of a wizard to him

1866.88 --> 1871.6000000000001
and that can be dangerous

1871.84 --> 1879.1999999999998
uh not necessarily

1876.159 --> 1881.1200000000001
danger it's not guaranteed though right

1879.2 --> 1882.799
it's just that if you're gonna follow

1881.12 --> 1884.7199999999998
somebody and you don't fully understand

1882.799 --> 1888.1589999999999
them yeah that could be a gandalf that

1884.72 --> 1888.159
could also be a saruman

1890.84 --> 1897.1999999999998
right

1893.679 --> 1899.519
and yes when i'm in with my mind

1897.2 --> 1900.96
dreaming about lord of the rings stuff

1899.519 --> 1903.76
yes i can

1900.96 --> 1904.32
make an analogy to anything lord of the

1903.76 --> 1907.279
rings

1904.32 --> 1909.519
with everything yes i can i'll spare you

1907.279 --> 1909.519
that

1909.84 --> 1921.84
hey gary wiebenga seeking star wars

1927.36 --> 1935.84
is pagan oh really

1930.72 --> 1935.84
what is that

1940.88 --> 1944.5590000000002
i don't know man like it's pretty

1943.36 --> 1948.0
difficult to even

1944.559 --> 1950.799
for me accurately

1948.0 --> 1951.919
on an esoteric level like pinpoint like

1950.799 --> 1956.0
what the freak

1951.919 --> 1956.88
is pagan there seem to be a lot of

1956.0 --> 1963.519
different spec

1956.88 --> 1966.3200000000002
yeah interpretations of this

1963.519 --> 1966.32
earth lover

1966.72 --> 1969.039
right

1974.84 --> 1983.84
but in what context

1980.399 --> 1983.84
is that like caretaker

1984.24 --> 1990.799
or is that like loving

1987.44 --> 1991.2
slash addicted to the earthly seductions

1990.799 --> 2005.84
like

1991.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
what what does that mean right

2012.679 --> 2019.8400000000001
syncretism yeah

2020.32 --> 2025.76
yeah that that sounds pretty solid there

2022.96 --> 2029.519
cameron kamikaze gilmore

2025.76 --> 2033.84
that yeah that is kind of what i do

2029.519 --> 2033.84
is that called syncretism okay

2056.159 --> 2061.2000000000003
aromatic kabbalah involves esoteric

2059.52 --> 2075.839
india called yeah

2061.2 --> 2075.839
sure does

2100.839 --> 2103.839
hmm

2114.079 --> 2119.04
her mysticism seems kabulistic you think

2128.839 --> 2131.839
right

2158.32 --> 2165.119
demonology part of it oh i

2161.599 --> 2168.079
i'd have to read it back it's been a

2165.119 --> 2168.079
long time

2168.48 --> 2172.4
i don't even know if i finished the

2170.079 --> 2175.599
whole thing

2172.4 --> 2177.6800000000003
like at some point i just like i got

2175.599 --> 2178.7200000000003
the patterns of it it's like okay this

2177.68 --> 2186.3999999999996
is yeah

2178.72 --> 2189.839
this is the pattern i get it now

2186.4 --> 2192.7200000000003
but yeah also felt there was a

2189.839 --> 2193.119
distinct sense of over generalization

2192.72 --> 2197.2
that

2193.119 --> 2199.52
they did the kind of the same thing that

2197.2 --> 2202.64
people in science typically do

2199.52 --> 2205.92
science is like oh

2202.64 --> 2208.72
like connected to make something

2205.92 --> 2209.2000000000003
like some multiple things into a string

2208.72 --> 2211.4399999999996
of a

2209.2 --> 2212.64
singular thing right strand it all

2211.44 --> 2215.76
together

2212.64 --> 2219.04
that's typically what scientists

2215.76 --> 2221.3590000000004
or the theorists love to do they want to

2219.04 --> 2225.2
put it all in one singular thing

2221.359 --> 2229.2
like to define reality through one

2225.2 --> 2233.9199999999996
thing or a few things right

2229.2 --> 2233.9199999999996
over unification and yeah

2236.8 --> 2243.8390000000004
hermetics definitely have a big hand in

2240.839 --> 2243.839
that

2244.56 --> 2247.7599999999998
but yeah then again there is something

2247.04 --> 2251.839
to it

2247.76 --> 2255.119
it's just that does it really apply

2251.839 --> 2258.24
in the fashion that they suggest

2255.119 --> 2261.599
or does it almost sort of

2258.24 --> 2267.04
in ways apply and not exactly

2261.599 --> 2267.04
like that right like there's a twist to

2268.839 --> 2271.839
it

2273.2 --> 2280.7999999999997
santos is awesome oh god

2276.32 --> 2280.8
really you think so i thought he's

2282.839 --> 2285.839
terrible

2291.28 --> 2296.32
uh maybe he said some good things here

2293.119 --> 2296.32
and there but god

2297.28 --> 2300.7200000000003
like his recent performance that that

2300.32 --> 2303.6800000000003
was

2300.72 --> 2303.68
not good man

2304.16 --> 2307.839
like i'd never be caught like that in

2306.88 --> 2313.839
public

2307.839 --> 2313.839
jesus man

2315.839 --> 2319.92
hello tony whitcomb good to see you

2320.64 --> 2327.839
sent a test seeking star water like

2324.839 --> 2327.839
where

2331.44 --> 2334.8
to my email or something

2338.839 --> 2343.52
no

2340.32 --> 2343.52
oh clutch right

2344.4 --> 2347.7090000000003
[Music]

2347.839 --> 2351.2799999999997
it's good to see you guys also like

2349.76 --> 2353.6800000000003
communicating back and forth

2351.28 --> 2355.76
outside of just the chat in my show

2353.68 --> 2360.24
really getting to know one another and

2355.76 --> 2360.2400000000002
kind of build

2360.64 --> 2370.0789999999997
on each other's skills i guess

2364.96 --> 2373.28
it's good i like that

2370.079 --> 2373.28
i know i am not a

2375.52 --> 2379.52
i make people think i make people dream

2378.0 --> 2381.68
i'm trying to

2379.52 --> 2383.359
like open their minds right i'm not a

2381.68 --> 2386.16
guy that typically

2383.359 --> 2386.48
like say own benjamin has a tendency to

2386.16 --> 2389.5989999999997
put

2386.48 --> 2392.64
people to work on tasks

2389.599 --> 2397.839
that part i lack

2392.64 --> 2397.839
as a teacher i lack it i'm aware of this

2407.68 --> 2425.839
i do think about it every now and then

2432.96 --> 2439.839
hmm all right tony whitcomb that sounds

2435.92 --> 2439.839
good i didn't know that

2440.72 --> 2453.839
maybe i did see it pop by on the

2444.4 --> 2453.839
alternative news

2467.68 --> 2470.8799999999997
but right now in my alternative news

2469.76 --> 2474.2400000000002
source it's

2470.88 --> 2477.52
it's like covet news only

2474.24 --> 2483.2
like all but against it

2477.52 --> 2485.28
right clearing up the propaganda

2483.2 --> 2487.5989999999997
against the vaccines all the damage it's

2485.28 --> 2491.0400000000004
doing

2487.599 --> 2493.599
but it is kind of astounding that

2491.04 --> 2494.4
to me it's not really astounding but it

2493.599 --> 2496.7200000000003
is still

2494.4 --> 2499.52
like fascinating to me that things that

2496.72 --> 2502.0789999999997
i've been saying

2499.52 --> 2502.8
as soon as i pick it up i feel like this

2502.079 --> 2505.92
is

2502.8 --> 2508.48
this is real and then i

2505.92 --> 2510.4
lay down a claim or set down a piece i

2508.48 --> 2514.0
make a prediction

2510.4 --> 2517.28
and now so much of things that i've said

2514.0 --> 2520.16
are like now standard issues

2517.28 --> 2521.52
that are being brought up in this

2520.16 --> 2524.0789999999997
counter-covet

2521.52 --> 2525.04
alternative news it's really fascinating

2524.079 --> 2528.2400000000002
to just

2525.04 --> 2531.04
scroll and see it all

2528.24 --> 2534.0789999999997
come back at you now through that it's

2531.04 --> 2534.079
really fascinating

2534.48 --> 2539.119
does make you think sometimes like did i

2537.359 --> 2541.7599999999998
contribute to this

2539.119 --> 2543.92
thing unrolling like this to the

2541.76 --> 2546.1600000000003
information there

2543.92 --> 2548.8
probably not you know i'm one in

2546.16 --> 2548.7999999999997
millions

2549.28 --> 2554.96
but maybe if i did

2552.4 --> 2559.2000000000003
then i haven't been informed about it

2554.96 --> 2559.2
but man i get that sensation sometimes

2560.4 --> 2567.119
probably not the only one i mean if you

2564.24 --> 2569.2
really buy into that then you will get

2567.119 --> 2573.2000000000003
savonia syndrome

2569.2 --> 2575.359
right but for honesty sakes i do have to

2573.2 --> 2580.48
point out that sometimes like i do get

2575.359 --> 2584.319
feeling like wow have i actually

2580.48 --> 2593.839
helped push this wagon in a way

2584.319 --> 2593.839
i hope so i think

2604.839 --> 2610.16
uh

2606.88 --> 2610.1600000000003
forbidden universe

2610.8 --> 2613.119
okay

2619.599 --> 2623.599
they say oh paradoxes are settled that

2622.319 --> 2626.88
makes no sense

2623.599 --> 2635.52
it's if it's a paradox it's not settled

2626.88 --> 2638.88
that's the point

2635.52 --> 2642.72
i have made a personal arwenian

2638.88 --> 2642.7200000000003
physical rule and this happened

2643.359 --> 2651.2799999999997
when i was 12 and that is

2647.2 --> 2655.9199999999996
if it's a paradox that means

2651.28 --> 2658.96
it's wrong because paradoxes can't

2655.92 --> 2663.52
physically happen

2658.96 --> 2667.2
they only happen conceptually when they

2663.52 --> 2670.4
arrive that means

2667.2 --> 2677.04
your conceptual thinking led you

2670.4 --> 2679.119
to a dead end

2677.04 --> 2680.64
if there's some writing somewhere that

2679.119 --> 2684.1600000000003
says something that

2680.64 --> 2691.839
contrasts that principle

2684.16 --> 2691.839
then i have to call corruption

2701.33 --> 2705.839
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2705.839
ah

2719.52 --> 2725.7599999999998
you love only savonia behavior

2722.64 --> 2732.48
what are you saying

2725.76 --> 2735.599
good servant i mean

2732.48 --> 2738.72
if you find it really funny i get

2735.599 --> 2747.839
that but loving it

2738.72 --> 2747.839
really that sounds very unhealthy

2758.839 --> 2761.839
uh

2766.0 --> 2769.04
is my chat stuck

2772.839 --> 2775.839
no

2786.839 --> 2789.839
so

2789.92 --> 2793.92
a good servant you're trying your

2791.839 --> 2796.88
sarcastic comedy routine

2793.92 --> 2796.88
again aren't you

2799.52 --> 2803.2
and yes what did you expect i'm arwin i

2802.56 --> 2817.839
always

2803.2 --> 2817.839
take those extremely literal at first

2828.839 --> 2831.839
so

2859.359 --> 2861.68
hmm

2862.88 --> 2873.839
that's interesting clutch bear

2879.04 --> 2886.16
well dreaming like crazy

2882.72 --> 2889.1189999999997
i've been dreaming plenty

2886.16 --> 2891.92
but it's not yeah it is intense a dream

2889.119 --> 2891.92
but it's like

2893.76 --> 2896.559
it's partial

2897.92 --> 2905.44
like i'm not like locking

2901.44 --> 2905.44
myself in the dream world like that

2907.68 --> 2911.2
but yeah the energies are pretty intense

2910.24 --> 2913.68
and

2911.2 --> 2914.8799999999997
also like in the experience i have a lot

2913.68 --> 2917.2
of energy

2914.88 --> 2918.48
like when i sl sleep sometimes in the

2917.2 --> 2921.68
dreams i just

2918.48 --> 2924.2400000000002
i'm never like weak anything never

2921.68 --> 2925.52
i never feel like demoralized never weak

2924.24 --> 2928.8799999999997
i'm always like

2925.52 --> 2933.839
help like i feel like

2928.88 --> 2943.2000000000003
i want to do things

2933.839 --> 2945.7599999999998
so many things at the same time

2943.2 --> 2946.64
and anyways i feel sometimes like i do

2945.76 --> 2950.96
actually do

2946.64 --> 2953.359
things in my dreams that have effect

2950.96 --> 2956.96
like it's another interface with with

2953.359 --> 2959.7599999999998
the happenings in the world i

2956.96 --> 2963.28
yeah it's hard to let that go that

2959.76 --> 2963.28
sensation sometimes it's

2969.839 --> 2976.48
also i got weird almost

2973.04 --> 2978.88
portal-like experiences sometimes

2976.48 --> 2981.76
where in daydreaming specifically i get

2978.88 --> 2984.0
the sensation like somebody

2981.76 --> 2985.76
that i think about like virtually

2984.0 --> 2989.119
approaches me

2985.76 --> 2991.6800000000003
and starts asking questions but it's

2989.119 --> 2991.6800000000003
like not

2991.92 --> 2995.599
my thinking it is not my simulation it's

2994.72 --> 2997.9199999999996
like

2995.599 --> 2998.6400000000003
it started out with my thinking but then

2997.92 --> 3002.16
it

2998.64 --> 3002.16
it starts to manifest

3002.319 --> 3008.64
from the other side it's

3005.359 --> 3010.7999999999997
yeah almost like i'm getting

3008.64 --> 3011.68
portal communications like spirits are

3010.8 --> 3014.559
coming to me

3011.68 --> 3016.16
from people like i'm actually

3014.559 --> 3018.1600000000003
communicating with them

3016.16 --> 3020.16
with their spirit like not their

3018.16 --> 3024.839
conscious physical

3020.16 --> 3027.839
experience but their dream side or

3024.839 --> 3027.839
something

3038.839 --> 3042.7999999999997
so

3040.64 --> 3046.7999999999997
all right but that doesn't happen when i

3042.8 --> 3046.8
go to sleep that happens just during the

3052.839 --> 3055.839
day

3066.839 --> 3071.52
uh

3068.559 --> 3074.4
i'm aj i don't know if that is literally

3071.52 --> 3074.4
dmt though

3079.76 --> 3084.079
like that's not a common thing to happen

3082.079 --> 3088.96
constantly

3084.079 --> 3088.96
dmt does provide much more heavy dreams

3094.559 --> 3098.079
right and yeah but unbelievable

3096.079 --> 3099.04
productions it really does happen during

3098.079 --> 3103.2000000000003
daydreaming

3099.04 --> 3106.8
i'm walking around thinking about stuff

3103.2 --> 3110.24
like really like deep deep

3106.8 --> 3113.3590000000004
thought and then

3110.24 --> 3116.5589999999997
it's like suddenly people try to like

3113.359 --> 3118.5589999999997
elbow their way through and like hey hey

3116.559 --> 3120.7200000000003
this and that

3118.559 --> 3122.7200000000003
and it's like okay it's like i just

3120.72 --> 3124.319
respond as if it interactively

3122.72 --> 3124.9599999999996
communicated kind of like what i do

3124.319 --> 3128.5589999999997
right here

3124.96 --> 3132.8
except i do it in the daydream

3128.559 --> 3134.7200000000003
i do the same thing it's

3132.8 --> 3139.8390000000004
and then i'm afterward like well yeah it

3134.72 --> 3139.839
happened again

3140.24 --> 3145.839
like i answer questions even in dreams

3146.079 --> 3150.559
the issue is are you ready to ask the

3149.52 --> 3153.359
question

3150.559 --> 3167.8390000000004
and if you are are you ready to receive

3153.359 --> 3167.839
the answer

3176.079 --> 3182.2400000000002
clutch bear yes yeah

3179.44 --> 3183.44
i know it's all out there it's just that

3182.24 --> 3187.5989999999997
i think it's not

3183.44 --> 3191.52
like just dmt

3187.599 --> 3191.52
it's a much more complicated process

3192.079 --> 3209.8390000000004
like dmt is probably just a part of it

3197.359 --> 3209.839
like very sporadic part

3234.839 --> 3237.839
hmm

3243.28 --> 3251.8390000000004
i feel like i'm dreaming

3246.319 --> 3251.839
starring a movie about zombies oh goody

3254.48 --> 3260.88
that's a very paranoid dream like

3257.839 --> 3261.68
i mean yeah you could call a lot of

3260.88 --> 3265.839
people out there

3261.68 --> 3265.839
zombies but

3267.92 --> 3273.04
like they're not literally gonna eat you

3270.559 --> 3276.7200000000003
alive or anything

3273.04 --> 3276.72
not literally just

3277.52 --> 3280.96
spiritually they'll try

3282.88 --> 3286.1600000000003
if they feel weakness

3287.52 --> 3290.64
just don't be afraid and you will find

3290.079 --> 3293.44
that you

3290.64 --> 3293.7599999999998
are kind of like if you are impervious

3293.44 --> 3298.2400000000002
to

3293.76 --> 3300.96
like their code

3298.24 --> 3304.0789999999997
then you almost become like nobility but

3300.96 --> 3304.079
you have to claim it

3304.64 --> 3307.839
and then live by it

3322.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
ah that's a good one seeking stir water

3324.88 --> 3335.839
i agree to that

3346.839 --> 3349.839
so

3351.52 --> 3355.2
ah but come on dutch sailor it's not

3353.76 --> 3358.7200000000003
that hellish

3355.2 --> 3360.8799999999997
i mean it is it's just

3358.72 --> 3362.24
the hell is there you just don't have to

3360.88 --> 3364.48
be a part of it

3362.24 --> 3364.4799999999996
right

3364.53 --> 3367.639
[Music]

3367.92 --> 3374.2400000000002
don't let it burn your toes

3371.76 --> 3377.44
you don't have to stand right next to

3374.24 --> 3380.24
the fire you know it's a fire

3377.44 --> 3382.0
you don't have to walk through it you

3380.24 --> 3385.9199999999996
don't have to

3382.0 --> 3385.92
burn with the fools

3386.0 --> 3391.839
although yeah of course it is going to

3387.839 --> 3391.839
be tragic

3403.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
we are part of it are you giving me the

3406.559 --> 3419.8390000000004
hobbit versus ant speech now

3428.96 --> 3435.839
no no you're the hobbit

3432.799 --> 3437.92
so we're part of this world

3435.839 --> 3440.64
it's like oh we have to dive in the

3437.92 --> 3442.799
fight oh really so

3440.64 --> 3444.96
i mean is there some saruman that's

3442.799 --> 3447.839
right around the corner that we could

3444.96 --> 3447.839
stop

3454.0 --> 3457.76
i guess you have to lead us to the edge

3456.16 --> 3461.839
of the forest so we could see

3457.76 --> 3461.8390000000004
the pillaging

3463.119 --> 3467.2000000000003
lord of the rings i told you you'll

3466.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
never get rid of it

3467.2 --> 3475.839
once i get in there

3484.64 --> 3488.0
emotionally right well guns have never

3486.799 --> 3494.24
owned that's really deep

3488.0 --> 3494.24
diving you gotta be careful with that

3496.16 --> 3503.839
right i'd say

3500.24 --> 3503.839
consider jesus

3504.0 --> 3512.24
like don't expend all your energy

3507.839 --> 3515.04
on well sorcery

3512.24 --> 3516.24
on well dreams kind of is in that

3515.04 --> 3518.799
department right

3516.24 --> 3521.04
like it's all about the physical action

3518.799 --> 3523.44
in the world

3521.04 --> 3524.24
if you exhaust your energy through

3523.44 --> 3526.16
dreams then

3524.24 --> 3528.3999999999996
even though you might potentially be

3526.16 --> 3530.799
achieving something through that

3528.4 --> 3532.799
that causes you to be exhausted in your

3530.799 --> 3536.319
physical activities

3532.799 --> 3536.319
on a regular basis then

3537.04 --> 3542.0
it should become more apparent that it

3539.04 --> 3544.72
might be leading you astray

3542.0 --> 3558.64
but that's up for you to figure out

3544.72 --> 3560.24
whether that's the case

3558.64 --> 3561.839
right in your dreams you have to make

3560.24 --> 3563.839
decisions too

3561.839 --> 3565.92
it's very good if you are in your dream

3563.839 --> 3567.68
world and you realize like yeah this is

3565.92 --> 3573.04
the dream world there is the physical

3567.68 --> 3576.0789999999997
world i have to balance it out

3573.04 --> 3577.52
if you're able to get your conscious to

3576.079 --> 3579.28
that point

3577.52 --> 3582.0
within the dream world and that part

3579.28 --> 3587.8390000000004
might be very difficult

3582.0 --> 3587.839
it might also snap the dream

3589.21 --> 3592.32
[Music]

3598.839 --> 3601.839
uh

3627.2 --> 3630.72
right well agm yes

3634.24 --> 3637.839
you can exert levels of control over

3637.04 --> 3640.88
your dream

3637.839 --> 3644.0789999999997
however does that mean

3640.88 --> 3646.4
that it is achievable to have full

3644.079 --> 3647.92
control over all your dreams at all

3646.4 --> 3652.1600000000003
times

3647.92 --> 3656.64
without a price i don't think so

3652.16 --> 3658.64
because this is like classic

3656.64 --> 3660.64
dreams are part of the challenge

3658.64 --> 3661.2799999999997
literally it's even through psychology

3660.64 --> 3664.16
which is

3661.28 --> 3664.88
atheist of course in approach but still

3664.16 --> 3669.04
it is

3664.88 --> 3669.6800000000003
well there's definitely correlations

3669.04 --> 3672.96
there

3669.68 --> 3675.1189999999997
that are very suggestive that i kind of

3672.96 --> 3676.319
like to keep in the back of my mind that

3675.119 --> 3679.6800000000003
is that dreams

3676.319 --> 3683.2
typically will show you the things

3679.68 --> 3685.04
you didn't know how to deal with

3683.2 --> 3686.8799999999997
in your physical experience and then

3685.04 --> 3689.92
they resolve then they come back

3686.88 --> 3692.319
and they come back to you for you to

3689.92 --> 3695.359
resolve right so there is a challenge

3692.319 --> 3699.2799999999997
through dreams as well so that means

3695.359 --> 3702.0
the challenge has to do with control

3699.28 --> 3704.4
then it's very likely that at some point

3702.0 --> 3707.599
if you're a real dream controller

3704.4 --> 3708.4
some point you subtly very unexpectedly

3707.599 --> 3711.2000000000003
completely

3708.4 --> 3714.0
lose control because it is actually the

3711.2 --> 3716.3999999999996
thing you need to face

3714.0 --> 3718.4
the loss of control right and then it

3716.4 --> 3721.76
becomes really complicated

3718.4 --> 3721.76
you can get stuck in that

3724.079 --> 3728.319
unless you can accept the loss of

3726.0 --> 3732.16
control like

3728.319 --> 3732.16
really inside let it through

3732.72 --> 3736.799
and that doesn't mean give up it means

3735.119 --> 3739.2000000000003
accepting that there's things you don't

3736.799 --> 3755.839
have a grip on

3739.2 --> 3755.839
anyway ah dreams dreams dreams

3763.2 --> 3768.799
huh right guns have never run i've had

3766.64 --> 3771.0389999999998
some really odd

3768.799 --> 3772.24
experiences and realization with my

3771.039 --> 3777.28
hyper analysis

3772.24 --> 3781.4399999999996
hyper application of conscious senses

3777.28 --> 3783.28
to try and sense the functioning of my

3781.44 --> 3786.88
own conscious and time awareness

3783.28 --> 3788.96
like as it happens this is really weird

3786.88 --> 3792.4
like i'm experiencing something and then

3788.96 --> 3792.4
from a third perspective

3793.2 --> 3799.68
i set a sense

3796.319 --> 3802.96
apart disconnected from

3799.68 --> 3807.2
my other conscious and then i make it

3802.96 --> 3810.88
almost like a reflector perceive

3807.2 --> 3813.2799999999997
what is happening

3810.88 --> 3814.559
from a neutral perspective and yeah

3813.28 --> 3817.44
sometimes i can just

3814.559 --> 3818.079
like analyze exactly how the thinking

3817.44 --> 3824.7200000000003
patterns

3818.079 --> 3827.3590000000004
of what i do work

3824.72 --> 3829.52
it becomes like cyclical risk assessment

3827.359 --> 3833.0389999999998
and just like

3829.52 --> 3838.24
is this proper ground

3833.039 --> 3841.039
for more exploit

3838.24 --> 3843.9199999999996
or is this something that needs rest is

3841.039 --> 3847.6800000000003
this something that

3843.92 --> 3847.6800000000003
could pose a long-term danger

3847.839 --> 3853.839
spiritual farming

3864.839 --> 3868.48
huh

3866.079 --> 3870.96
well not even spirit it's more like idea

3868.48 --> 3870.96
farming

3879.76 --> 3882.88
right and then when you have a think

3881.599 --> 3885.52
tank

3882.88 --> 3888.1600000000003
you're basically all idea farming and

3885.52 --> 3890.319
exchanging seeds

3888.16 --> 3891.839
that's when thing gets gets really

3890.319 --> 3893.68
intense

3891.839 --> 3896.0789999999997
that's when the fruits really start

3893.68 --> 3896.0789999999997
pumping

3896.72 --> 3909.839
for good or for worse depending on who

3899.28 --> 3909.8390000000004
the farmers are

3919.839 --> 3926.0789999999997
sleepers i never got that one agm

3923.039 --> 3926.079
sleep paralysis

3930.4 --> 3937.839
i feel that sleep paralysis has to do

3933.92 --> 3941.079
with nervousness in some way

3937.839 --> 3945.2799999999997
i feel it has to do with like a like a

3941.079 --> 3948.0
physiological stress response

3945.28 --> 3948.0
in some way

3948.799 --> 3952.319
maybe vulnerability to spirit influences

3951.92 --> 3956.96
like

3952.319 --> 3959.599
extra spiritual entities

3956.96 --> 3960.319
that might use the weakness to do stuff

3959.599 --> 3963.2000000000003
and then

3960.319 --> 3964.5589999999997
it might trigger that mechanism or

3963.2 --> 3966.5589999999997
something i don't know man sleep

3964.559 --> 3970.1600000000003
paralysis is weird

3966.559 --> 3970.1600000000003
i've never experienced it

3971.839 --> 3978.4
even though i have been like

3975.359 --> 3982.72
it's like this i've always been

3978.4 --> 3985.839
very cautious of fear

3982.72 --> 3989.0389999999998
in myself because i have been

3985.839 --> 3992.88
very fearful in my life and like

3989.039 --> 3995.039
like panic attacks and [ __ ] i have it so

3992.88 --> 3997.52
much better of control it's unbelievable

3995.039 --> 4000.7990000000004
i never thought i'd attain this level of

3997.52 --> 4004.24
stability ever never thought it

4000.799 --> 4005.52
i thought i was [ __ ] but i'm getting a

4004.24 --> 4010.16
lot better

4005.52 --> 4010.16
like yeah a lot better

4010.72 --> 4013.839
and what i did know though is that if

4013.28 --> 4018.079
you are

4013.839 --> 4022.319
in fear and you don't overcome that fear

4018.079 --> 4024.6400000000003
like don't do weird [ __ ]

4022.319 --> 4025.52
it's super dangerous when you're afraid

4024.64 --> 4029.7599999999998
like don't go

4025.52 --> 4034.319
into like trying to contact spirits or

4029.76 --> 4037.28
getting weird witchy creepy [ __ ] like

4034.319 --> 4038.799
even for play ouija boards like if you

4037.28 --> 4040.7200000000003
have some kind of a fear

4038.799 --> 4044.0
in you you got a freaking problem when

4040.72 --> 4046.48
you do that [ __ ] i know it i just

4044.0 --> 4047.68
never experienced it i've experienced it

4046.48 --> 4050.72
in others

4047.68 --> 4053.2799999999997
when others were just like

4050.72 --> 4055.0389999999998
afraid to show that they were afraid so

4053.28 --> 4058.48
they kept it a secret

4055.039 --> 4058.48
those people get [ __ ]

4059.76 --> 4066.0
by bizarre spirit [ __ ]

4063.119 --> 4067.039
right always when you're afraid to walk

4066.0 --> 4070.079
away don't

4067.039 --> 4072.6400000000003
try to pretend it's

4070.079 --> 4072.6400000000003
not good

4074.319 --> 4080.16
and i've like made that mistake

4078.0 --> 4081.839
from kind of a point where i was very

4080.16 --> 4084.24
strong and confident

4081.839 --> 4086.48
and then that mistake gave me really

4084.24 --> 4088.0
weird experiences that gave me literal

4086.48 --> 4090.2400000000002
nightmares afterward

4088.0 --> 4092.079
where i would be haunted like by a big

4090.24 --> 4096.0
dark

4092.079 --> 4100.159000000001
demonic cloud with yeah with claws and

4096.0 --> 4102.839
eyes and [ __ ] was creepy as [ __ ]

4100.159 --> 4105.679
and that was when i wasn't was really

4102.839 --> 4106.88
strong right so i can only imagine that

4105.679 --> 4110.4
if you're like

4106.88 --> 4111.92
really weak and you're too afraid to

4110.4 --> 4114.48
admit it you're gonna

4111.92 --> 4114.4800000000005
be [ __ ]

4117.52 --> 4121.4400000000005
yeah i've been through circles where

4120.799 --> 4124.88
people

4121.44 --> 4124.879999999999
do really weird [ __ ]

4125.279 --> 4128.4800000000005
and i was like more curious at the time

4128.08 --> 4130.839
like

4128.48 --> 4132.3189999999995
is that real or is this really their

4130.839 --> 4135.92
delusions

4132.319 --> 4140.0
i approached it scientifically

4135.92 --> 4143.359
i tried to very weird though

4140.0 --> 4144.56
very difficult because there is an

4143.359 --> 4148.64
influence it's

4144.56 --> 4149.679
just not esoteric it's esoteric and you

4148.64 --> 4152.719
don't always

4149.679 --> 4154.4
know it especially if you're not aware

4152.719 --> 4157.759
of

4154.4 --> 4159.3589999999995
logos consciously

4157.759 --> 4162.319
if you might know about it if you don't

4159.359 --> 4164.799
know like logos is being violated

4162.319 --> 4166.56
something is wrong that is pushed and

4164.799 --> 4170.239
then you don't recognize it

4166.56 --> 4172.400000000001
then yeah [ __ ] you know

4170.239 --> 4175.3589999999995
i'm being very vague on purpose because

4172.4 --> 4177.3589999999995
i yeah

4175.359 --> 4179.839
don't it's just that people probably

4177.359 --> 4182.64
especially in their youth they always

4179.839 --> 4183.44
seek out trouble and exciting stuff and

4182.64 --> 4189.839
they

4183.44 --> 4189.839
come across this

4202.32 --> 4206.159
sleep talking another interesting never

4204.96 --> 4208.96
yeah

4206.159 --> 4208.96
i don't do that

4212.96 --> 4219.36
when i talk in my sleep must be really

4216.88 --> 4219.36
urgent

4219.6 --> 4226.320000000001
in the dream and then i always wake up

4222.0 --> 4226.32
from feeling the vibration in my own

4226.55 --> 4231.84
[Music]

4228.84 --> 4231.84
head

4233.04 --> 4238.88
because i don't mutter in my sleep i

4235.76 --> 4242.88
don't mutter in the real world i used to

4238.88 --> 4243.4400000000005
mutter inaudibly halfway embarrassed and

4242.88 --> 4247.12
[ __ ]

4243.44 --> 4247.12
don't do that ever now

4247.36 --> 4250.5599999999995
and when you don't do that in real life

4249.04 --> 4251.199
then you don't do that in your dreams

4250.56 --> 4254.4800000000005
either

4251.199 --> 4254.48
it's all about the mindset

4257.44 --> 4260.239
sleepwalking

4271.199 --> 4278.48
i've had dreams

4274.32 --> 4282.239
in which i was sleep walking

4278.48 --> 4282.239
knew it and couldn't wake up

4282.56 --> 4286.159000000001
i've never had physical proof that i

4285.6 --> 4288.08
actually

4286.159 --> 4290.639999999999
sleepwalked in the real physical world

4288.08 --> 4291.199
but i had really weird freaky dreams one

4290.64 --> 4293.679
time

4291.199 --> 4295.199
like i think when i was like 16 or

4293.679 --> 4298.4800000000005
something

4295.199 --> 4301.839999999999
14 maybe i

4298.48 --> 4305.36
was sleepwalking

4301.84 --> 4309.12
but like i was awake to

4305.36 --> 4311.5199999999995
know that i was asleep and

4309.12 --> 4314.4
being sleepwalking but i couldn't do

4311.52 --> 4318.88
anything about it

4314.4 --> 4321.36
that was a weird dream very scary

4318.88 --> 4323.6
that's the feeling like i've turned into

4321.36 --> 4326.08
a zombie i lost all control yeah that's

4323.6 --> 4327.6
scary as [ __ ] because i also it was very

4326.08 --> 4329.44
intense i didn't know

4327.6 --> 4330.8
at the time it was a dream you know when

4329.44 --> 4333.678999999999
i was much younger

4330.8 --> 4335.360000000001
i couldn't freaking distinguish between

4333.679 --> 4338.96
dreams and the real world

4335.36 --> 4340.639999999999
a lot of the time and the dreams were

4338.96 --> 4342.719
very crystal clear

4340.64 --> 4343.92
like more clear than real world

4342.719 --> 4346.2390000000005
experiences and

4343.92 --> 4348.56
that's how i eventually figured out the

4346.239 --> 4350.799999999999
difference but i didn't know for a long

4348.56 --> 4350.8
time

4352.08 --> 4357.84
ah well

4358.239 --> 4364.239
yeah i've had some nightmares when i was

4360.08 --> 4364.239
young they were really scary

4366.82 --> 4372.5599999999995

4369.76 --> 4374.4800000000005
but i don't have nightmares like that

4372.56 --> 4376.96
like for a long long time

4374.48 --> 4378.5599999999995
those were really about personal control

4376.96 --> 4380.719
in retrospect

4378.56 --> 4384.56
but control over my own faculties to

4380.719 --> 4389.28
control over my representation

4384.56 --> 4392.4800000000005
right i was really bad

4389.28 --> 4396.48
at it i'm not a superstar right now

4392.48 --> 4396.48
in communicating well i am in like

4396.84 --> 4404.0
communication not the social part of it

4401.44 --> 4405.28
i'm getting better they used to be

4404.0 --> 4408.8
really bad

4405.28 --> 4411.92
like just couldn't talk

4408.8 --> 4415.360000000001
and then eventually somebody shoved the

4411.92 --> 4418.0
doobie in my hand when i was like 15

4415.36 --> 4420.96
that completely like threw this blanket

4418.0 --> 4422.4
over me and then i just started rambling

4420.96 --> 4424.2390000000005
because i was always thinking on the

4422.4 --> 4426.639999999999
inside and suddenly it just

4424.239 --> 4429.919999999999
came rolling out and started talking

4426.64 --> 4435.12
almost like an autistic person at first

4429.92 --> 4435.12
and then i kind of held on to that

4436.0 --> 4443.52
it taught me how to

4439.28 --> 4443.5199999999995
open up to other people

4449.36 --> 4454.48
before that i would sometimes open up

4452.239 --> 4457.759999999999
like towards my parents or my brother

4454.48 --> 4457.759999999999
but it would be different though

4463.44 --> 4471.919999999999
got demons around you that sucks

4467.28 --> 4471.92
well i had for some time too

4475.199 --> 4485.12
demons more more devils not demons

4482.0 --> 4487.76
were very tricky and they were in the

4485.12 --> 4487.76
mood for it

4491.679 --> 4496.32
and so was i i was very tricky when i

4493.76 --> 4500.08
was in the mood for it

4496.32 --> 4503.199
but never like really evil tricky always

4500.08 --> 4503.199
tricky of the mind

4508.84 --> 4511.84
huh

4516.4 --> 4525.04
oh [ __ ] oh

4520.4 --> 4527.92
tony tony tony tony well there's some

4525.04 --> 4527.92
karma for you

4534.159 --> 4539.839999999999
that's yeah that's not a nice spot to be

4537.28 --> 4539.84
in

4554.4 --> 4559.839999999999
dude tony like confession time i've

4558.32 --> 4563.5199999999995
confessed it before but i've

4559.84 --> 4563.52
i've cheated on a girl once

4563.679 --> 4568.2390000000005
like once the other well no

4566.96 --> 4570.159
yeah the other time was different

4568.239 --> 4572.239
because it kind of already i already

4570.159 --> 4576.08
gave her a sign like i don't wanna

4572.239 --> 4578.639999999999
i don't wanna take it so i just moved on

4576.08 --> 4580.64
then i still broke her heart but then

4578.64 --> 4583.4400000000005
i'm embarrassed about it but it was dif

4580.64 --> 4584.0
but at one time i really did cheat and

4583.44 --> 4586.4
it was

4584.0 --> 4587.84
freaking freaking a cold experience for

4586.4 --> 4590.719
crying out loud

4587.84 --> 4591.6
that was really weird tail to that thing

4590.719 --> 4596.159
really weird

4591.6 --> 4596.159000000001
really really really really weird as in

4598.159 --> 4604.08
stuff spirit

4601.6 --> 4605.52
that claimed to be a god and me

4604.08 --> 4608.719
investigating

4605.52 --> 4611.4400000000005
so much weird stuff rolled out of there

4608.719 --> 4612.4800000000005
afterward but yeah i cheated on her and

4611.44 --> 4617.599999999999
that was like a

4612.48 --> 4620.639999999999
nightmare like it was a nightmare to me

4617.6 --> 4622.0
if ned i had never done it before i

4620.64 --> 4624.159000000001
would never wanted to

4622.0 --> 4626.159
that's always so typical about it right

4624.159 --> 4629.44
and then

4626.159 --> 4629.44
i allowed it to happen

4630.159 --> 4635.759999999999
and it just it hurt me the most because

4633.679 --> 4638.96
i really liked her i thought that she

4635.76 --> 4642.719
was a really nice person not perfect but

4638.96 --> 4647.36
like my girl didn't deserve that

4642.719 --> 4650.08
and i but i in total time

4647.36 --> 4651.759999999999
face to face i kept it secret for about

4650.08 --> 4654.88
half an hour after that i

4651.76 --> 4658.8
literally burst out in tears

4654.88 --> 4660.64
with guilt and i literally went on my

4658.8 --> 4664.2390000000005
knees and begged her

4660.64 --> 4666.719
like just to forgive me it was

4664.239 --> 4667.5199999999995
really terrible i couldn't keep it i

4666.719 --> 4669.52
don't even

4667.52 --> 4672.64
see how other people that do this sort

4669.52 --> 4676.2390000000005
of thing like can keep it to themselves

4672.64 --> 4678.719
i don't know man i'm just i'm being a

4676.239 --> 4681.12
lot more careful

4678.719 --> 4682.719
of course yeah i've never done anything

4681.12 --> 4685.04
like that since

4682.719 --> 4687.76
don't plan to ever again i know what

4685.04 --> 4687.76
that is now

4688.239 --> 4695.759999999999
ugh it's a long time ago

4693.28 --> 4695.759999999999
it is

4699.48 --> 4707.839999999999
2006. yeah

4714.48 --> 4719.04
but it got weird too it got weird

4718.0 --> 4722.88
because

4719.04 --> 4726.159
i was open about it she

4722.88 --> 4728.159000000001
probably had hereditary

4726.159 --> 4732.239
she kind of responded in a way that she

4728.159 --> 4732.239
just wanted to forget about it

4732.8 --> 4738.2390000000005
she just tried to forget about it

4736.239 --> 4739.759999999999
not to be hurt but that didn't work

4738.239 --> 4742.799999999999
because i

4739.76 --> 4743.4400000000005
in my openness and my eagerness to get

4742.8 --> 4745.360000000001
over it

4743.44 --> 4746.5599999999995
actually wanted her to be punishing

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
towards me

4746.56 --> 4749.84
and that didn't work

4750.48 --> 4754.48
she could not attain that role and she

4753.04 --> 4757.679
didn't want to and

4754.48 --> 4760.799999999999
she shouldn't have to

4757.679 --> 4762.4
and that's how we then broke up it was a

4760.8 --> 4764.88
very shameful time for me

4762.4 --> 4766.719
very very shameful it was very

4764.88 --> 4769.679
embarrassed towards my friends too

4766.719 --> 4772.8
who she was like part of the circle very

4769.679 --> 4772.8
embarrassing time for me

4774.84 --> 4777.84
ugh

4782.8 --> 4785.1990000000005
all right

4789.52 --> 4794.8
so there you go confession i'm not

4802.84 --> 4805.84
stainless

4808.96 --> 4814.8
wrench no i

4812.08 --> 4817.12
i'm not going to do it there's people so

4814.8 --> 4819.4400000000005
good at it

4817.12 --> 4822.88
like i i'm not even gonna try to match

4819.44 --> 4822.879999999999
their level of accuracy

4830.239 --> 4833.839999999999
no one here is my friend what

4845.679 --> 4850.719
oh is that something that that ben

4848.48 --> 4853.36
shapiro typically says to

4850.719 --> 4854.4800000000005
i don't know man i don't watch him i i

4853.36 --> 4856.719
literally don't

4854.48 --> 4857.759999999999
i've seen a couple of things and i was

4856.719 --> 4861.84
just like

4857.76 --> 4861.84
ugh that's not for me

4864.159 --> 4871.679
oh not stainless right

4867.679 --> 4871.679
okay you're not that sort of stain

4872.84 --> 4875.84
thanks

4899.84 --> 4905.92
right that's right

4903.44 --> 4908.719
gaining wisdom i don't know about that

4905.92 --> 4911.76
place though but yes

4908.719 --> 4914.0
something can look like it has a

4911.76 --> 4914.639
beautiful design but if you go inside

4914.0 --> 4920.8
and it just

4914.639 --> 4920.8
feels wrong then it's just wrong

4921.44 --> 4931.839999999999
do i know where she is today

4924.96 --> 4931.84
who she

4934.96 --> 4941.84
you mean the ex i cheated on

4938.719 --> 4945.84
i don't know she went to became a

4941.84 --> 4945.84
school teacher

4948.239 --> 4954.799999999999
she was

4951.44 --> 4959.839999999999
well she was kind of gothic

4954.8 --> 4959.84
in the sense that she

4960.719 --> 4967.36
she didn't seem to like

4963.76 --> 4970.719
life very much it wasn't suicidal or

4967.36 --> 4970.719
anything she just was like

4971.679 --> 4975.84
pessimistic in many ways towards

4974.88 --> 4977.6
humanity

4975.84 --> 4980.400000000001
so i don't know where she says she might

4977.6 --> 4982.8
still be alive

4980.4 --> 4984.839999999999
probably i'd say i don't see any reason

4982.8 --> 4988.320000000001
why not unless she

4984.84 --> 4990.32
like got stuck and got into vaccine [ __ ]

4988.32 --> 4993.599999999999
or something

4990.32 --> 4995.44
i hope not she was aware of alex jones

4993.6 --> 4998.84
even back then that was like whoa

4995.44 --> 5003.36
cool like her brother got into alex

4998.84 --> 5003.360000000001
jones it was really funny at the time

5005.36 --> 5010.239
but to have that connection she didn't

5007.92 --> 5012.56
take it super serious though but she was

5010.239 --> 5013.5199999999995
like taking note she would always be

5012.56 --> 5015.84
taking note of

5013.52 --> 5015.84
everything

5017.12 --> 5031.599999999999
anyway i hope she's doing great

5028.159 --> 5035.36
did i give her any tips uh

5031.6 --> 5035.360000000001
it's a long time ago man

5040.4 --> 5046.638999999999
i don't think it was a time where i was

5042.48 --> 5046.638999999999
really having a lot of good advice in me

5046.719 --> 5049.12
you know

5050.96 --> 5054.08
that's more of something of the last 10

5053.199 --> 5057.12
years i mean i

5054.08 --> 5059.28
i knew i tried but i would be

5057.12 --> 5059.28
just

5060.239 --> 5066.638999999999
not not practical enough

5063.84 --> 5069.04
be more obsessed with my own

5066.639 --> 5072.2390000000005
fascinations

5069.04 --> 5076.08
things i didn't really get a lot of

5072.239 --> 5076.08
practical advice out of things yet

5079.92 --> 5083.52
i think i did give her a couple of tips

5082.32 --> 5087.04
on teaching though

5083.52 --> 5087.040000000001
and through psychology

5088.0 --> 5091.6
i did help her a little with that and i

5090.0 --> 5094.159
did give her like some personal

5091.6 --> 5099.280000000001
confidence in her own skills

5094.159 --> 5102.5599999999995
she is a very smart person

5099.28 --> 5104.719
yeah smart enough uh

5102.56 --> 5107.4400000000005
anyway yeah i don't really i haven't

5104.719 --> 5107.44
seen her in like

5108.239 --> 5113.0
well i guess

5112.4 --> 5115.44
15

5113.0 --> 5118.239
[Music]

5115.44 --> 5119.839999999999
13 years i haven't seen her in a long

5118.239 --> 5121.44
time i don't know

5119.84 --> 5123.28
i hope she's doing fine anyway let's

5121.44 --> 5127.839999999999
move on it's a bit awkward talking about

5123.28 --> 5127.84
an x like that

5146.96 --> 5152.0
be kind right maybe i should round out

5150.639 --> 5154.2390000000005
although i don't want to run out the

5152.0 --> 5158.48
show on this

5154.239 --> 5160.5599999999995
this is it's not a good subject to round

5158.48 --> 5168.718999999999
out on

5160.56 --> 5182.8
let's get back to dreams good dreams

5168.719 --> 5197.84
oh [ __ ] slow mo move buggy

5182.8 --> 5197.84
all right

5198.0 --> 5202.0
huh all right dutch sailor huh

5203.84 --> 5207.679
and i've had my fair share of flying

5205.52 --> 5208.84
dreams i still do i just don't really go

5207.679 --> 5211.6
places

5208.84 --> 5214.400000000001
flying i just have like

5211.6 --> 5216.4800000000005
local flying ability it's like oh let's

5214.4 --> 5218.719
get in that tree

5216.48 --> 5219.759999999999
or let's stick to that ceiling to hide

5218.719 --> 5225.6
or okay

5219.76 --> 5229.52
let's hyperfloat and that means like

5225.6 --> 5234.96
staying off the ground uh two feet

5229.52 --> 5234.96
and then slide really really fast

5236.08 --> 5239.679
like laying down like as if you were in

5238.4 --> 5243.759999999999
like a uh

5239.679 --> 5243.76
a sled works really well

5245.04 --> 5252.0
is the earth always flat in my dreams uh

5248.56 --> 5253.76
when i can touch down yes i have seen

5252.0 --> 5256.239
the globe in my dreams but it would

5253.76 --> 5259.6
never be a place i could approach

5256.239 --> 5259.599999999999
it would always be a visual

5260.159 --> 5264.638999999999
if it was in a location where there was

5262.88 --> 5266.159000000001
actual physical things that i could

5264.639 --> 5270.0
touch down on yes

5266.159 --> 5270.0
it was pretty much always flat

5272.48 --> 5281.839999999999
didn't really think about it too much

5306.84 --> 5309.84
hmm

5312.159 --> 5315.599999999999
