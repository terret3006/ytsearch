92.079 --> 98.15899999999999
quite a beautiful day

93.6 --> 101.759
look at that a couple of

98.159 --> 102.32000000000001
i think yeah there's a plane over there

101.759 --> 106.159
but it

102.32 --> 106.15899999999999
doesn't seem to leave anything behind

106.479 --> 109.84
there's been some things

110.64 --> 114.0
up there but yeah overall still very

113.2 --> 117.119
nice and blue

114.0 --> 117.119
and the sun is bright

117.2 --> 119.759
look at that

121.119 --> 124.159
enjoyed some of that

125.52 --> 133.2
yeah quite a beautiful day

129.039 --> 135.94
a bit windy though but not cold

133.2 --> 139.11999999999998
huh so

135.94 --> 143.44
[Music]

139.12 --> 147.68
ah where is everybody

143.44 --> 147.68
managed to start on time today

151.12 --> 153.44
right

155.84 --> 160.879
uh yeah i'll make some notes a couple

162.4 --> 166.16
yeah uh yesterday's still not flat earth

164.64 --> 170.23899999999998
debates

166.16 --> 173.68
so nathan nathan's problem with this

170.239 --> 177.68
computer system seems to be persisting

173.68 --> 180.4
hasn't been online at all too bad

177.68 --> 180.959
hopefully today will be different but we

180.4 --> 184.4
haven't

180.959 --> 188.48
really heard anything from nathan

184.4 --> 188.48000000000002
yet so it might take a while

188.64 --> 194.319
it's kind of weird

191.68 --> 194.87900000000002
to have the flat earth debates missing

194.319 --> 198.39999999999998
and

194.879 --> 199.92
yeah like as a result the guys have been

198.4 --> 202.48000000000002
chatting

199.92 --> 204.39999999999998
over skype calls and everything

202.48 --> 207.04
yesterday too

204.4 --> 208.72
uh but yeah it's kind of a vacuum out

207.04 --> 212.72
there now

208.72 --> 214.56
a bit weird uh yeah i did also manage to

212.72 --> 217.44
catch a

214.56 --> 218.4
martin luther stream and that was kind

217.44 --> 220.56
of nice

218.4 --> 221.68
just sitting in there going through that

220.56 --> 224.959
stuff

221.68 --> 227.519
that he presents and to me

224.959 --> 228.0
it's really it's kind of funny in a way

227.519 --> 230.159
because

228.0 --> 231.2
i don't mean anything disrespectful but

230.159 --> 234.159
martin luther

231.2 --> 237.11999999999998
like has some really weird conclusions

234.159 --> 241.28
often that he presents with the pictures

237.12 --> 243.28
that i just yeah tend to not agree

241.28 --> 244.4
with but that's all fine you know it

243.28 --> 246.56
just

244.4 --> 247.84
he likes to do that and then i like to

246.56 --> 251.04
point out

247.84 --> 252.08
like how i recognize things i always do

251.04 --> 254.48
that

252.08 --> 255.76000000000002
i don't think he minds maybe it's a part

254.48 --> 257.28
of the game

255.76 --> 260.15999999999997
because i sometimes think that he's

257.28 --> 262.55999999999995
playing like this game just to

260.16 --> 264.72
make you think and make you puzzle it

262.56 --> 268.4
out

264.72 --> 270.16
and it's yeah it's fun and yeah he has

268.4 --> 272.79999999999995
great pictures to present so

270.16 --> 275.52000000000004
anyway hey michael jones first in chat

272.8 --> 275.52000000000004
good to see you

276.0 --> 281.199
a couple of weird comments yesterday or

278.72 --> 281.199
i think

281.44 --> 286.639
notice noticed it in the youtube from

284.479 --> 288.8
guns of never on rmp but when i wanted

286.639 --> 292.56
to click on them they were kind of gone

288.8 --> 293.199
so i think that maybe he removed them

292.56 --> 296.479
later

293.199 --> 298.24
seemed kind of pissed off at what he

296.479 --> 302.32
thought was me defending

298.24 --> 305.36
people that do not require defense

302.32 --> 310.15999999999997
i don't think i was doing that

305.36 --> 311.44
but maybe he realized that later that's

310.16 --> 313.03900000000004
why he removed it

311.44 --> 316.0
but i don't know for sure it was kind of

313.039 --> 316.0
weird seeing that

318.24 --> 322.0
like godzilla from seemed really pissed

321.199 --> 325.36
off

322.0 --> 328.639
so hope to see him

325.36 --> 328.639
maybe we could talk it out

330.56 --> 334.24
yeah michael jones yeah i like martin

332.32 --> 336.479
too he's been there forever

334.24 --> 338.0
and he's always very persistently done

336.479 --> 341.36
things in the way that he does

338.0 --> 344.4
it chat

341.36 --> 349.199
yesterday got complicated

344.4 --> 349.19899999999996
you mean here in the show michael jones

351.68 --> 357.68
yes it did get kind of complicated but

354.32 --> 357.68
yeah that's my show for you

362.4 --> 369.67999999999995
hey george stanford

366.96 --> 369.68
oh goody

376.24 --> 379.759
yeah well there's getting yeah i'm

378.639 --> 382.72
getting a lot of those

379.759 --> 384.639
articles or they're popping up like for

382.72 --> 386.24
a long time now like all these people

384.639 --> 389.12
trying the vaccine

386.24 --> 390.16
just dying or getting terrible terrible

389.12 --> 393.199
side effects

390.16 --> 396.88000000000005
in the testing stages it's been seeing

393.199 --> 396.88
articles like that for months

401.12 --> 405.68
it's very weird

402.65 --> 405.67999999999995
[Music]

406.84 --> 411.75899999999996
anyway so yeah i

409.68 --> 414.40000000000003
uh did make a lot of no i've been

411.759 --> 415.49
watching a lot of babylon five

414.4 --> 418.15999999999997
this is

415.49 --> 421.199
[Music]

418.16 --> 422.639
i think i even missed owen benjamin at

421.199 --> 424.56
some point

422.639 --> 426.56
it could be that he streamed really late

424.56 --> 428.56
and i just missed out on it

426.56 --> 430.24
because i went to bed at like around

428.56 --> 433.039
three o'clock

430.24 --> 434.96000000000004
it was good because i need to go to bed

433.039 --> 436.88
earlier and just not stay up so

434.96 --> 437.44
incredibly late so i just get plenty of

436.88 --> 440.479
sleep

437.44 --> 440.479
it's better for me

442.319 --> 449.68
all right anyway

446.56 --> 453.44
yeah i'm open for conversation

449.68 --> 453.44
questions all kinds of things

456.88 --> 466.71999999999997
am good to see you

464.479 --> 468.87899999999996
so yeah i'm just gonna enjoy the

466.72 --> 473.199
sunlight

468.879 --> 479.84000000000003
in direct sunlight it's still nice until

473.199 --> 479.84000000000003
until i get a conversation going

494.8 --> 498.479
oh yes it was weird somebody made a

497.039 --> 502.15999999999997
comment

498.479 --> 503.44
about was it again they wanted me to

502.16 --> 506.639
address a

503.44 --> 509.919
dr becky video

506.639 --> 512.64
and hoped that i would make yeah make a

509.919 --> 514.64
reply video to that

512.64 --> 516.479
which i don't think it wasn't meant as a

514.64 --> 518.88
troll it's just that

516.479 --> 520.719
i never really do that people might have

518.88 --> 522.479
noticed like i do respond to something

520.719 --> 525.6800000000001
if it is

522.479 --> 528.24
like worth mentioning or if there's like

525.68 --> 530.8
a new global trick

528.24 --> 534.9590000000001
but i rarely address like the real spin

530.8 --> 536.7199999999999
doctors in a direct sense it's like

534.959 --> 539.5189999999999
people in the flat earth debates already

536.72 --> 539.519
tend to do that

541.68 --> 545.279
yeah and as soon as i saw like oh yeah

544.0 --> 548.16
dr becky video oh

545.279 --> 550.8
two hours oh yeah that oh i'm just gonna

548.16 --> 555.04
watch that sit through that oh

550.8 --> 563.8389999999999
no no i will not

555.04 --> 563.8389999999999
because yeah that's a real chore

564.08 --> 567.6800000000001
so if there's like a very special moment

566.64 --> 570.16
somewhere

567.68 --> 571.1999999999999
where a glober or spin doctor says

570.16 --> 573.6
something

571.2 --> 575.2
it would be good if you'd also link to

573.6 --> 577.839
timestamps of that

575.2 --> 578.88
so that i can check it out because to

577.839 --> 581.12
just

578.88 --> 582.56
suggest that i sit through like two

581.12 --> 584.64
hours

582.56 --> 586.0799999999999
of global nonsense without actually

584.64 --> 589.1999999999999
knowing what to look for

586.08 --> 592.08
that's just yeah i think i got

589.2 --> 592.08
better things to do

595.04 --> 600.16
all right yeah more pleasant things to

597.2 --> 605.7700000000001
do to say the least

600.16 --> 608.899
all right

605.77 --> 608.899
[Music]

611.12 --> 619.839
so what's been going on out there guys

630.839 --> 635.0590000000001
okay

632.0 --> 635.059
[Music]

638.45 --> 642.9190000000001
[Music]

644.839 --> 647.839
hey

658.839 --> 665.9200000000001
right yeah

662.64 --> 669.8389999999999
any comments about my uh

665.92 --> 669.8389999999999
what is it my germ

670.24 --> 676.64
and terrain theory conjunction

674.88 --> 678.64
i thought i would get more response to

676.64 --> 681.68
that

678.64 --> 684.16
like either disagreements or

681.68 --> 685.3599999999999
people that would say like yeah i

684.16 --> 688.959
thought of that too but

685.36 --> 692.0
i didn't get any response to it at all

688.959 --> 692.0
kind of disappointed

694.56 --> 696.88
whoa

698.8 --> 706.399
wait she was on tv you watch tv

702.48 --> 706.399
roger what the [ __ ]

711.839 --> 718.639
well well michael jones look oh on

716.24 --> 718.639
twitter

719.2 --> 722.399
i have to assume anything on tv is fake

722.0 --> 725.519
well

722.399 --> 730.639
michael jones that's true but

725.519 --> 734.88
how is it fake so maybe

730.639 --> 735.44
maybe it's it sounds disgusting but

734.88 --> 737.92
maybe

735.44 --> 738.8000000000001
we're supposed to be seeing this [ __ ]

737.92 --> 741.76
maybe they

738.8 --> 742.399
are basically remember they have to

741.76 --> 745.68
share it

742.399 --> 747.519
openly with everyone before they unleash

745.68 --> 750.3199999999999
it

747.519 --> 750.88
so maybe this is just like the proof

750.32 --> 753.9200000000001
they are

750.88 --> 754.72
giving us like make it happen life to

753.92 --> 759.1999999999999
people that

754.72 --> 762.24
don't that are like

759.2 --> 764.639
not in in on it so they just

762.24 --> 766.8
showed it i don't know i i don't think

764.639 --> 768.5600000000001
it it was an accident or that it's just

766.8 --> 769.92
completely fake could be though i don't

768.56 --> 773.8389999999999
have any proof

769.92 --> 776.24
either way

773.839 --> 777.44
but maybe they are because i've seen so

776.24 --> 779.6
much of this

777.44 --> 781.0400000000001
just so many articles out there that

779.6 --> 784.5600000000001
just say like it's

781.04 --> 787.1999999999999
dangerous that are just honest about it

784.56 --> 789.8389999999999
and at the same time governments are

787.2 --> 793.2
just still pushing it anyway

789.839 --> 793.2
it's very weird isn't it

797.279 --> 801.95
drug companies fighting over who gets to

799.6 --> 808.919
jab people

801.95 --> 808.9190000000001
[Music]

809.2 --> 815.12
well if anything the whole situation is

812.24 --> 816.32
just really revealing to people who have

815.12 --> 818.399
the eye

816.32 --> 820.5600000000001
and the mind and the spirit to pay

818.399 --> 824.079
attention to it

820.56 --> 826.6389999999999
that the yeah the vaccine industry

824.079 --> 827.3599999999999
is just bad news overall that the people

826.639 --> 829.6
there are

827.36 --> 831.92
only really interested in making money

829.6 --> 834.9590000000001
and not

831.92 --> 838.4799999999999
like they're really nothing like doctors

834.959 --> 841.5189999999999
at all or what we would always think

838.48 --> 844.0
doctors would be like

841.519 --> 846.079
hippocratic oath and all like the

844.0 --> 848.959
vaccine industry obviously just has

846.079 --> 850.2399999999999
nothing to do with that at all and i

848.959 --> 852.399
hope that that

850.24 --> 853.6
is going to really sink in on a wider

852.399 --> 857.839
scale

853.6 --> 857.839
even with the normies

864.8 --> 871.8389999999999
that falls positive for hiv what the

868.839 --> 871.839
hell

882.399 --> 885.839
oh wow they say that okay well yeah i

884.72 --> 889.44
know poof

885.839 --> 890.5600000000001
didn't know that but just the media here

889.44 --> 894.8000000000001
has gotten

890.56 --> 898.079
really terrible like

894.8 --> 900.56
it's almost like it's worse

898.079 --> 901.8389999999999
than over at other countries but it's

900.56 --> 904.4799999999999
also because

901.839 --> 905.2790000000001
i guess they just are really trying to

904.48 --> 909.04
break

905.279 --> 910.0
everything when we got things relatively

909.04 --> 913.8389999999999
under control

910.0 --> 913.839
i think sort of

913.92 --> 918.639
i don't even know how to describe how if

916.88 --> 921.8389999999999
yeah what i feel about it it's very

918.639 --> 924.32
difficult and complicated

921.839 --> 925.6
we're just more aware of manipulations

924.32 --> 930.72
on average

925.6 --> 935.279
i guess than other nations in the world

930.72 --> 935.279
it's like because of suspicious nature

936.88 --> 942.399
but yeah the manipulations are just like

939.519 --> 942.399
astounding

945.759 --> 952.16
like almost just full-on mind control

949.199 --> 953.4399999999999
sometimes and that like unnerves me to

952.16 --> 956.3199999999999
see that happening

953.44 --> 956.32
in the netherlands

957.36 --> 969.839
three quarters of dutch is like who

959.519 --> 969.839
comes up with that [ __ ]

970.399 --> 976.72
anyway like who the hell needs to go to

973.839 --> 976.72
bars anyway

977.6 --> 981.36
although yeah look i don't see any harm

980.24 --> 983.199
in bars

981.36 --> 986.32
you know although yeah you drink alcohol

983.199 --> 986.3199999999999
whatever but

987.279 --> 992.639
really it's gonna be for bars it's just

990.56 --> 993.199
crazy they're just trying to seduce

992.639 --> 997.44
people

993.199 --> 1000.639
into just going for it

997.44 --> 1001.69
just trying to make them

1000.639 --> 1004.869
get it somehow

1001.69 --> 1004.869
[Music]

1005.04 --> 1012.8
and festivals

1010.079 --> 1012.8
ridiculous

1017.199 --> 1025.839
yeah i had my fair share of going to

1019.36 --> 1025.839
festivals roger

1030.0 --> 1036.319
that it's it's really just insane

1033.039 --> 1039.439
like they they can't really do that

1036.319 --> 1042.24
constitutional wise it's yeah again it's

1039.439 --> 1043.76
a part the people that are organizing

1042.24 --> 1046.64
the festivals must be

1043.76 --> 1049.52
in on it then if it's actually going to

1046.64 --> 1051.76
happen because they're the ones that all

1049.52 --> 1052.96
basically have to enforce it it's it's

1051.76 --> 1057.2
like that every time

1052.96 --> 1057.2
it's always up to the organizer

1059.76 --> 1067.12
now if the government all has them

1063.36 --> 1070.7199999999998
in their back pocket in some way then

1067.12 --> 1070.7199999999998
yeah maybe they can do that

1075.84 --> 1094.559
right can't get a permit but yeah p

1079.039 --> 1097.28
it's gonna piss people off

1094.559 --> 1098.3999999999999
like seriously all this [ __ ] is just

1097.28 --> 1102.96
making the cattle

1098.4 --> 1106.4
extremely restless like that hey nathan

1102.96 --> 1106.4
hey good to see you man

1106.84 --> 1111.9189999999999
huh how's your computer doing

1110.0 --> 1113.679
it's the first time i'm hearing from you

1111.919 --> 1117.919
since

1113.679 --> 1117.919
was it thursday or wednesday even

1121.28 --> 1124.8799999999999
broken right

1127.2 --> 1133.76
any any

1130.48 --> 1136.08
timing on when it's gonna be fixed or

1133.76 --> 1137.76
what are you doing exactly because

1136.08 --> 1141.36
nobody's knows anything

1137.76 --> 1144.4
at the moment hey mer

1141.36 --> 1144.3999999999999
men beardella

1145.84 --> 1149.28
george sanford the computer obviously i

1148.32 --> 1151.84
asked

1149.28 --> 1151.84
didn't you hear

1155.039 --> 1162.24
hey rubbish waiting to find out

1158.88 --> 1162.24
oh you send it to a store

1162.84 --> 1167.52
hmm

1165.52 --> 1168.6399999999999
right but what in general happened

1167.52 --> 1170.799
wouldn't it just

1168.64 --> 1172.5590000000002
like it wouldn't start up anymore or it

1170.799 --> 1179.679
broke during the

1172.559 --> 1182.48
boot up screen

1179.679 --> 1183.6000000000001
where did it go wrong like it didn't

1182.48 --> 1186.16
start up at all or

1183.6 --> 1186.8799999999999
you like it didn't get past the the

1186.16 --> 1190.96
first

1186.88 --> 1190.96
screen like the tech the tech screen

1191.84 --> 1195.36
before the uh

1195.44 --> 1199.039
the operating system starts up

1199.76 --> 1204.84
couldn't turn it on again oh so it was

1201.919 --> 1207.8400000000001
probably the power supply then

1204.84 --> 1207.84
huh

1208.0 --> 1212.4
if literally it won't power up then it's

1210.4 --> 1215.679
the then it's probably your

1212.4 --> 1219.039
power the thing in the back

1215.679 --> 1219.039
what's it called the converter

1219.28 --> 1225.039
it might have like burned through

1222.96 --> 1226.4
but that's good that's a good sign

1225.039 --> 1228.24
because that means that

1226.4 --> 1230.0800000000002
like the most expensive parts of your

1228.24 --> 1232.48
computer are probably not

1230.08 --> 1232.48
fried

1233.84 --> 1238.9599999999998
you just had a new one well there you go

1237.039 --> 1240.799
i can already predict then it was the

1238.96 --> 1243.679
powers it was a new one

1240.799 --> 1243.679
yeah that can happen

1247.039 --> 1254.559
so it probably was like uh

1250.799 --> 1257.2
yeah what do you say a production

1254.559 --> 1258.96
error then and it just fused or

1257.2 --> 1260.48
something okay well that's good that's

1258.96 --> 1262.96
good that means that you don't have to

1260.48 --> 1265.679
like buy an entirely new computer

1262.96 --> 1267.6000000000001
just have to replace that part actually

1265.679 --> 1270.24
i could even tell you that

1267.6 --> 1272.3999999999999
you wouldn't have had to send it to the

1270.24 --> 1276.32
repairman you could have just ordered

1272.4 --> 1279.039
a new a replacement for that

1276.32 --> 1280.24
and maybe even get get it for free

1279.039 --> 1284.0
because you should have a

1280.24 --> 1286.88
manufacturing guarantee

1284.0 --> 1288.88
right just replace it see if it all

1286.88 --> 1290.4
starts up again now if it wouldn't then

1288.88 --> 1293.1200000000001
you might have a problem

1290.4 --> 1294.64
because then maybe like a feedback

1293.12 --> 1296.32
energy loop may have damaged your

1294.64 --> 1298.88
motherboard or something

1296.32 --> 1301.2
but yeah you would very easily be able

1298.88 --> 1305.8400000000001
to find out

1301.2 --> 1305.8400000000001
without waiting too much but oh well

1307.6 --> 1310.85
[Music]

1312.72 --> 1317.3600000000001
yeah roger i just talked about it it's

1315.12 --> 1320.4799999999998
the it's the travo

1317.36 --> 1323.84
it's the energy or the

1320.48 --> 1326.64
energy converter very likely because it

1323.84 --> 1326.6399999999999
would start up

1328.72 --> 1333.84
new hdd

1336.88 --> 1340.72
right but the converter you probably

1339.76 --> 1344.0
ordered it

1340.72 --> 1348.0
you said you had a new one so you'll get

1344.0 --> 1361.039
at least a year manufacturing guarantee

1348.0 --> 1363.84
on those standard sometimes two

1361.039 --> 1363.84
overclock

1368.08 --> 1377.1999999999998
uh no

1374.159 --> 1377.2
why flat side

1377.44 --> 1380.799
it's just a power converter

1382.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
the mobo what

1397.28 --> 1400.47
[Music]

1403.52 --> 1406.559
a motherboard right

1414.4 --> 1420.48
could have built what no he already

1417.84 --> 1420.48
explained it

1420.96 --> 1424.559
the the symptoms are obvious

1428.32 --> 1433.9189999999999
this power transformer

1431.6 --> 1435.039
which was new it probably had a

1433.919 --> 1438.159
manufacturing

1435.039 --> 1439.44
error and it just burned out very

1438.159 --> 1441.8400000000001
quickly

1439.44 --> 1443.6000000000001
so probably nothing else is influenced

1441.84 --> 1445.76
because it just wouldn't start up again

1443.6 --> 1447.6
it's not about frying the motherboard or

1445.76 --> 1450.8799999999999
anything

1447.6 --> 1453.039
right because when those yeah

1450.88 --> 1455.0390000000002
those things are specifically designed

1453.039 --> 1455.6
when they blow up that they don't feed

1455.039 --> 1458.0
back

1455.6 --> 1459.76
onto the motherboard and destroy it

1458.0 --> 1473.84
right

1459.76 --> 1473.84
so that that is extremely rare

1484.84 --> 1487.84
okay

1491.52 --> 1501.84
okay well that sucks dude

1503.84 --> 1508.08
hit it with my elbow then it turned off

1512.84 --> 1515.84
hmm

1520.0 --> 1530.08
that's odd well then you might have

1528.96 --> 1534.08
caused

1530.08 --> 1535.6789999999999
like it to be short circuit basically

1534.08 --> 1538.32
like with my computer i have to be

1535.679 --> 1538.3200000000002
careful too

1538.4 --> 1547.1200000000001
although yeah with me it's like the

1543.279 --> 1547.12
well no it's been a while though but

1547.2 --> 1552.48
if i yeah if i apply then

1550.24 --> 1553.76
like this solid state disc can sometimes

1552.48 --> 1557.84
freeze up

1553.76 --> 1557.84
i used to have that problem

1558.32 --> 1571.84
anyway yeah good luck with that hope to

1561.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
i guess see you monday

1582.84 --> 1585.84
hmm

1591.039 --> 1594.8799999999999
right yeah george sanford and i think

1593.44 --> 1598.48
that why that happens

1594.88 --> 1601.1200000000001
is because of static electricity

1598.48 --> 1602.96
like if something gets to suddenly touch

1601.12 --> 1606.0
the frame

1602.96 --> 1608.88
then it might just get this static shock

1606.0 --> 1611.44
sometimes depending on the conditions

1608.88 --> 1615.44
the weather conditions

1611.44 --> 1616.559
it's weird that's like yeah my intuitive

1615.44 --> 1620.24
explanation for

1616.559 --> 1622.1589999999999
how that can happen like it also happens

1620.24 --> 1625.2
if i keep my computer running

1622.159 --> 1626.5590000000002
and i just open up the side if i just

1625.2 --> 1629.919
unscrew it take it off

1626.559 --> 1629.9189999999999
it usually freezes

1630.96 --> 1635.76
and so i think that's probably because

1632.559 --> 1635.76
of static electricity

1637.84 --> 1643.4399999999998
anyway good to hear from you at least

1641.2 --> 1655.8400000000001
nathan thanks for showing up

1643.44 --> 1655.8400000000001
the ether lame

1669.21 --> 1672.319
[Music]

1678.1 --> 1683.84
[Music]

1680.84 --> 1683.84
wow

1685.2 --> 1688.48
yeah with hard disks yeah that's right

1687.6 --> 1690.8799999999999
well

1688.48 --> 1691.76
it's not like it used to be a lot easier

1690.88 --> 1694.88
though you know

1691.76 --> 1698.0
what modern hard disks

1694.88 --> 1700.88
are actually you like they yeah

1698.0 --> 1701.2
if you really like shock snap them while

1700.88 --> 1703.679
they're

1701.2 --> 1704.96
running yeah they're still gonna damage

1703.679 --> 1708.96
but that's basically just

1704.96 --> 1711.279
attacking it but they can't take a

1708.96 --> 1714.32
little bump they don't

1711.279 --> 1717.76
like hard crash haven't seen a hard disk

1714.32 --> 1717.76
hard crash in a long time

1718.24 --> 1722.0
i've never had a hard disk hard crash on

1720.64 --> 1726.3200000000002
me

1722.0 --> 1728.24
but seen other people's do that

1726.32 --> 1730.08
especially if you're like sloppy with it

1728.24 --> 1733.1200000000001
like you have your hard disk just

1730.08 --> 1734.96
laying outside on your table

1733.12 --> 1737.1999999999998
while checking out and then you

1734.96 --> 1739.6000000000001
accidentally elbow it off the table

1737.2 --> 1742.0
yeah that's how you get a heart crash

1739.6 --> 1742.0
this is

1745.89 --> 1751.3600000000001
[Music]

1748.159 --> 1767.0390000000002
right i don't get that sloppy

1751.36 --> 1770.08
very careful with my computer parts

1767.039 --> 1770.08
all right anyway

1774.399 --> 1778.84
what's the difference between ac and dc

1777.2 --> 1781.6000000000001
electricity

1778.84 --> 1785.6
uh

1781.6 --> 1789.1999999999998
well it's a different way of

1785.6 --> 1791.279
like manifesting it i don't know how is

1789.2 --> 1794.0800000000002
it

1791.279 --> 1795.039
like one is basically a stable singular

1794.08 --> 1797.12
current

1795.039 --> 1799.22
and the other one is like switching it

1797.12 --> 1801.6789999999999
constantly

1799.22 --> 1803.52
[Music]

1801.679 --> 1806.5590000000002
if i remember correctly i don't know

1803.52 --> 1806.559
which one was which

1806.64 --> 1809.8400000000001
i always mix it up

1810.799 --> 1814.399
but i know the difference

1815.279 --> 1818.64
and i think that standard electricity

1818.0 --> 1821.279
sockets

1818.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
use the constant switching type of

1821.279 --> 1823.84
electricity

1831.76 --> 1839.279
it corrupted the main ssd

1837.2 --> 1840.3990000000001
well then you might have a freeze-up

1839.279 --> 1843.76
effect

1840.399 --> 1845.4399999999998
nathan i've had that with ssds i got new

1843.76 --> 1846.799
ones that don't do that anymore but i

1845.44 --> 1849.3600000000001
used to have one

1846.799 --> 1850.32
that sometimes it would freeze up and

1849.36 --> 1855.039
then i'd

1850.32 --> 1856.72
literally have to wait over 24 hours

1855.039 --> 1865.84
you just have to wait and then it

1856.72 --> 1865.84
unfreezes sadly it was very weird

1867.84 --> 1871.76
because if it would just would not start

1869.919 --> 1874.7990000000002
up at all you would not even like it

1871.76 --> 1874.799
would not power up

1877.2 --> 1884.0800000000002
then you would yeah then it's not

1880.48 --> 1885.039
like yeah your ssd or your motherboard

1884.08 --> 1893.48
then it's just

1885.039 --> 1898.799
the power converter anyway

1893.48 --> 1898.799
alternative direct current right right

1900.159 --> 1907.8400000000001
yeah it is oj it is like a big usb drive

1909.42 --> 1912.539
[Music]

1916.32 --> 1919.519
and i've also seen like in other

1918.399 --> 1922.32
computers

1919.519 --> 1923.84
types like i think mini computers where

1922.32 --> 1925.9189999999999
there's ssds for those

1923.84 --> 1928.0
that literally just look like memory

1925.919 --> 1931.3600000000001
cards

1928.0 --> 1935.12
for in-memory card slots

1931.36 --> 1949.84
like that's just the ssds very weird

1935.12 --> 1949.84
it's just being used as memory card now

1958.72 --> 1966.24
all right

1962.32 --> 1966.24
nothing is moving in an ssd

1967.2 --> 1977.8400000000001
why would you ask that earth passenger

2005.02 --> 2009.289
[Music]

2027.039 --> 2032.0
right so anything other than computers

2029.6 --> 2034.08
you guys want to talk about

2032.0 --> 2047.84
is that what you came here for you

2034.08 --> 2047.84
discuss computers

2059.76 --> 2067.119
what a bit

2062.96 --> 2067.119
cranky during the debates which debates

2067.76 --> 2073.3590000000004
i haven't exactly been cranky

2071.44 --> 2076.8
i just get annoyed when people start

2073.359 --> 2076.7999999999997
rumpusing over one another

2080.32 --> 2089.839
and yeah i don't know but i'm just

2084.399 --> 2089.839
i'm just trying to keep some order

2103.359 --> 2106.88
it's just a new me this is how i am i'm

2106.32 --> 2109.2000000000003
i'm just

2106.88 --> 2111.2000000000003
not as patient and i'm definitely not

2109.2 --> 2114.3999999999996
tolerating disrespect anymore i just

2111.2 --> 2114.3999999999996
don't do that anymore

2115.44 --> 2119.44
like whatever the risk may be i'm just

2117.839 --> 2121.2799999999997
not gonna do that

2119.44 --> 2122.88
does that mean that people might hate me

2121.28 --> 2126.5600000000004
at times sadly well

2122.88 --> 2126.56
yeah too bad

2127.44 --> 2130.64
i'm trying to do it for the betterment

2129.839 --> 2136.32
of everyone

2130.64 --> 2145.839
and everything how about biofuel

2136.32 --> 2145.839
yeah how about it

2149.599 --> 2155.76
tired of the bs well which bs would that

2156.839 --> 2159.839
be

2178.8 --> 2187.28
what how do solar panels work

2183.119 --> 2190.0
uh are they cost effective

2187.28 --> 2190.0
i'm not sure

2190.56 --> 2197.839
i think so it depends on the region

2194.56 --> 2200.0
and on the on the type solar panels you

2197.839 --> 2203.04
know there's been a lot of development

2200.0 --> 2205.04
in the solar panels the technology it's

2203.04 --> 2207.52
become a lot cheaper and more efficient

2205.04 --> 2207.52
i think

2209.68 --> 2215.2799999999997
so i i like solar power

2213.04 --> 2217.359
it's just that if you're going to like

2215.28 --> 2221.76
power everything with it

2217.359 --> 2224.0
then yeah

2221.76 --> 2225.2000000000003
that may be a little tricky but it's

2224.0 --> 2228.64
best

2225.2 --> 2234.56
it's very easy for just local power

2228.64 --> 2234.56
or power assistance it's not perfect

2240.0 --> 2246.0
right well flat side fe again that's

2243.839 --> 2247.119
it's a difficult thing to size up you

2246.0 --> 2250.32
really have to just

2247.119 --> 2251.6800000000003
realize like where are you how much

2250.32 --> 2254.96
power do you get out of it

2251.68 --> 2257.2
on average and then during yeah it has

2254.96 --> 2259.119
phases because daylight's not constant

2257.2 --> 2260.56
everything so you have to account for

2259.119 --> 2271.21
everything and then just

2260.56 --> 2273.44
size up like is it worth it

2271.21 --> 2277.04
[Music]

2273.44 --> 2279.44
but i'm not an electro engineer

2277.04 --> 2281.52
who can like help you calculate that

2279.44 --> 2283.92
right

2281.52 --> 2285.44
but i've always been relatively positive

2283.92 --> 2290.48
about solar panels

2285.44 --> 2292.48
like like the wind turbines not so much

2290.48 --> 2295.119
they're just turning out to be more and

2292.48 --> 2297.839
more of a disaster really

2295.119 --> 2298.4
but solar power yeah i've nev it's never

2297.839 --> 2300.88
like oh

2298.4 --> 2301.52
solar power oh that's so so bad bad

2300.88 --> 2305.359
decision

2301.52 --> 2305.359
no never it never really is

2310.839 --> 2314.0
so

2312.16 --> 2316.8799999999997
but i think that the concept could

2314.0 --> 2319.04
probably develop much further even

2316.88 --> 2320.4
and it has in ways remember there's like

2319.04 --> 2323.44
this the giant

2320.4 --> 2325.119
mirror stations that all aim it

2323.44 --> 2329.68
they build those in deserts and they all

2325.119 --> 2329.6800000000003
aim it at like a center point

2330.16 --> 2334.96
that system that's also basically a form

2332.48 --> 2337.92
of solar panel

2334.96 --> 2338.56
that's happened and who knows where else

2337.92 --> 2341.839
it could

2338.56 --> 2341.839
be can be taken

2344.0 --> 2347.599
so i think there's just a lot of room

2345.839 --> 2355.599
for solar power based

2347.599 --> 2357.44
systems in development

2355.599 --> 2361.28
right and certain regions are going to

2357.44 --> 2364.4
thrive on that like california and

2361.28 --> 2366.8
the sahara regions

2364.4 --> 2367.76
and china probably too but places where

2366.8 --> 2371.2000000000003
this just

2367.76 --> 2373.76
always the freaking sun so yeah you can

2371.2 --> 2373.7599999999998
use that

2381.76 --> 2386.2400000000002
michael moore ripped solar in one of his

2384.0 --> 2389.839
documentaries oh well that's

2386.24 --> 2391.68
cute wind power i just addressed that

2389.839 --> 2394.72
earth passenger i don't

2391.68 --> 2394.72
it's not a good idea

2395.359 --> 2401.44
windmills have been problematic very

2398.72 --> 2401.4399999999996
problematic

2404.079 --> 2408.96
and polluting that's the big problem

2407.28 --> 2410.3190000000004
you know solar panel the the problem

2408.96 --> 2413.119
with solar panels is they

2410.319 --> 2414.56
there's like certain chemicals involved

2413.119 --> 2416.1600000000003
that are not very good for the

2414.56 --> 2419.52
environment right

2416.16 --> 2425.839
that's a bit of a problem but

2419.52 --> 2425.839
yeah so so to do a lot of other things

2426.0 --> 2432.72
and windmills just they need

2429.68 --> 2435.52
more stuff they need more

2432.72 --> 2438.72
what is going to turn into just waste

2435.52 --> 2440.56
that can't even be recycled

2438.72 --> 2443.1189999999997
so in the netherlands they've had a lot

2440.56 --> 2446.24
of windmills and they're now

2443.119 --> 2449.92
having to replace them and it just

2446.24 --> 2453.839
leaves giant stockpiles of dead

2449.92 --> 2453.839
turbines it's terrible

2454.079 --> 2459.6800000000003
it's a lot of waste that's just like

2457.76 --> 2467.3590000000004
that's not feasible and there's been a

2459.68 --> 2469.9199999999996
lot of complaints about it

2467.359 --> 2473.92
is nuclear power good option absolutely

2469.92 --> 2473.92
nuclear power is the best thing ever

2474.64 --> 2478.72
and guess what there is no radioactive

2477.839 --> 2482.96
pollution

2478.72 --> 2487.4399999999996
it just doesn't exist it's all a scam

2482.96 --> 2487.44
to i think it is scam to basically

2488.48 --> 2491.92
poison the well concerning nuclear power

2491.44 --> 2494.4
to

2491.92 --> 2495.6800000000003
keep it in their own hands i think it's

2494.4 --> 2499.119
it's like a

2495.68 --> 2501.52
myth they put on top of it

2499.119 --> 2502.1600000000003
so that people would kind of shy away

2501.52 --> 2504.64
from it

2502.16 --> 2505.92
and the nuclear power industry could

2504.64 --> 2509.839
keep it a secret

2505.92 --> 2509.839
that it's just hyper efficient

2524.4 --> 2530.319
and hey nuclear power even like also

2528.079 --> 2532.48
knows development and there's very

2530.319 --> 2536.16
there's great systems

2532.48 --> 2539.68
new systems now half the world i think

2536.16 --> 2542.24
there's at least america there's like

2539.68 --> 2544.0
nuclear power plants that are just super

2542.24 --> 2548.16
old

2544.0 --> 2549.92
in a very old system and that's bad news

2548.16 --> 2551.7599999999998
whether you believe in radioactive

2549.92 --> 2553.52
pollution or anything it's just not a

2551.76 --> 2556.4
good system

2553.52 --> 2557.44
all the those systems need to be

2556.4 --> 2559.359
replaced

2557.44 --> 2560.56
in my opinion with much more

2559.359 --> 2564.0
state-of-the-art

2560.56 --> 2567.44
newer developments newer developed

2564.0 --> 2570.72
mechanisms for nuclear power plants just

2567.44 --> 2574.2400000000002
get it over with and then

2570.72 --> 2579.68
yeah it'll probably serve

2574.24 --> 2582.9599999999996
to solve a lot of issues with power

2579.68 --> 2586.3999999999996
because i think there's a lot

2582.96 --> 2586.4
of uranium and all that

2591.68 --> 2595.68
does anyone know if there has actually

2594.4 --> 2599.28
been a working

2595.68 --> 2599.2799999999997
perpetual magnet motive

2603.04 --> 2608.48
i've never seen one

2606.16 --> 2611.52
but there's been all these yeah

2608.48 --> 2615.04
perpetual energy

2611.52 --> 2617.2
testers all these

2615.04 --> 2619.599
things that supposedly work and it's

2617.2 --> 2622.72
been going for decades

2619.599 --> 2622.7200000000003
but it's yeah i've never

2622.88 --> 2628.2400000000002
the sorrel system is a magnet perpetual

2626.24 --> 2631.359
magnet supposedly

2628.24 --> 2634.3999999999996
but yet never had any

2631.359 --> 2637.2799999999997
seen any conclusive proof that it

2634.4 --> 2637.28
actually works

2641.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
aquaphonic system what

2654.64 --> 2658.0
what flat side i don't know what you're

2657.04 --> 2663.599
talking about

2658.0 --> 2665.76
at all

2663.599 --> 2668.6400000000003
oh yeah well andy says it's very simple

2665.76 --> 2672.6400000000003
there isn't any

2668.64 --> 2673.2
there is none this idea of a radioactive

2672.64 --> 2676.48
site

2673.2 --> 2678.16
yeah that's doesn't exist it's full of

2676.48 --> 2681.76
life

2678.16 --> 2683.1189999999997
no yeah it doesn't exist it's full of

2681.76 --> 2684.8
life

2683.119 --> 2691.839
there's people living there this i think

2684.8 --> 2691.8390000000004
there's even like festivals there

2693.72 --> 2697.5299999999997
[Music]

2698.88 --> 2703.2000000000003
and you should be relieved because

2701.04 --> 2705.2799999999997
because if it wasn't

2703.2 --> 2707.2799999999997
then everything's going to be dead very

2705.28 --> 2709.3590000000004
quickly remember what supposedly

2707.28 --> 2711.52
happened with fukushima

2709.359 --> 2713.119
how bad that supposedly is that means

2711.52 --> 2715.7599999999998
that like half the ocean

2713.119 --> 2717.52
is just inevitably going to die from

2715.76 --> 2720.7200000000003
poisoning okay

2717.52 --> 2722.96
so that's that should be a great relief

2720.72 --> 2725.1189999999997
to realize that we are not all freaking

2722.96 --> 2730.96
doomed by this crazy

2725.119 --> 2734.56
stuff that's been put into creation

2730.96 --> 2738.4
so there's just too much evidence

2734.56 --> 2740.7999999999997
that it's not real

2738.4 --> 2747.839
that this idea of radioactive poisoning

2740.8 --> 2747.8390000000004
just is not real

2751.52 --> 2756.079
nuclear and atomic bombs real no no

2754.0 --> 2757.68
they're not

2756.079 --> 2761.8390000000004
there's no scientific evidence of

2757.68 --> 2761.839
nuclear fission

2763.52 --> 2768.48
they're still pretty damn big bombs so

2766.48 --> 2769.119
doesn't really matter in retrospect

2768.48 --> 2772.48
because they

2769.119 --> 2773.359
have just insanely large bombs that'll

2772.48 --> 2777.52
effectively

2773.359 --> 2780.24
level things just the same right

2777.52 --> 2789.839
they don't need nukes anymore the idea

2780.24 --> 2789.839
of it

2791.04 --> 2797.599
and i don't know maybe like emps

2794.079 --> 2798.5600000000004
might be real i don't know how but that

2797.599 --> 2801.76
might be

2798.56 --> 2804.319
real so if they just get

2801.76 --> 2805.28
all the elements that are as considered

2804.319 --> 2808.4
to be

2805.28 --> 2809.76
a result of a nuclear explosion there's

2808.4 --> 2813.76
supposed to be like an emp

2809.76 --> 2816.079
effect and then the shock wave and then

2813.76 --> 2817.92
so then maybe they can just

2816.079 --> 2821.599
technologically produce

2817.92 --> 2824.079
all these things and then later claim

2821.599 --> 2825.3590000000004
they use the nuclear bomb they just

2824.079 --> 2829.119
leveled they emp

2825.359 --> 2832.0789999999997
it then they leveled it and

2829.119 --> 2833.04
then they just put a perimeter around it

2832.079 --> 2834.88
or whatever or

2833.04 --> 2836.319
just make the government say like we

2834.88 --> 2840.0
nuked it so

2836.319 --> 2842.8
it's now considered radioactive

2840.0 --> 2844.319
and you will comply with that and then

2842.8 --> 2846.4
maybe we'll get a peace deal

2844.319 --> 2849.2
right something i don't know something

2846.4 --> 2849.2000000000003
in that direction

2854.16 --> 2860.72
oh really so where did they do that iron

2857.44 --> 2860.7200000000003
x6 vi

2861.2 --> 2864.16
2006

2865.28 --> 2870.7200000000003
we've all heard of that has it ever

2870.839 --> 2873.839
happened

2877.44 --> 2883.52
all right yeah 26 okay okay

2880.64 --> 2883.52
yeah i got that wrong

2885.44 --> 2889.04
right because then otherwise it would be

2888.72 --> 2892.24
c

2889.04 --> 2901.839
c v i right right

2892.24 --> 2901.839
oh my nomin roman numerals

2904.64 --> 2908.4
doesn't decay i don't know who says it

2907.52 --> 2915.839
doesn't decay

2908.4 --> 2915.839
did i say it doesn't decay

2933.76 --> 2938.079
well is decaying nuclear fission flat

2936.96 --> 2940.319
side iffy

2938.079 --> 2942.319
i don't i think you're mixing up the

2940.319 --> 2943.92
terminologies here because the fission

2942.319 --> 2947.119
is like the

2943.92 --> 2950.4
critical mass explosion

2947.119 --> 2952.88
just radioactive decay

2950.4 --> 2957.839
and nuclear fission aren't vision aren't

2952.88 --> 2957.839
the same thing

2985.2 --> 2989.52
fission and fusion well it's supposed to

2987.44 --> 2993.04
be two different

2989.52 --> 2995.119
there they counter opposite our fission

2993.04 --> 2998.319
is basically the

2995.119 --> 3001.76
substance on an atomic level

2998.319 --> 3005.119
losing but is it electrons or weight it

3001.76 --> 3006.559
it basically transforms and fusion is

3005.119 --> 3009.6800000000003
the opposite

3006.559 --> 3013.2000000000003
where basically elements are infused

3009.68 --> 3017.2799999999997
with energy supposedly its theory

3013.2 --> 3017.2799999999997
and then it become it yeah

3018.0 --> 3024.96
it causes a fusion reaction which gives

3021.76 --> 3027.44
off more energy and then it fuses

3024.96 --> 3029.44
the material smaller parts of material

3027.44 --> 3031.44
fuses together so it's the exact

3029.44 --> 3035.2000000000003
opposite of fission

3031.44 --> 3035.2000000000003
where yeah

3039.119 --> 3043.44
i know it's it's all kind of theoretical

3049.2 --> 3057.68
reactors fusion bombs fission yeah

3052.319 --> 3057.68
it's all theory though there's no proof

3063.52 --> 3070.8
right and fusion that's like

3066.839 --> 3071.839
it's it's not lit that's not the same

3070.8 --> 3074.2400000000002
thing

3071.839 --> 3076.88
though you know fusion is much more

3074.24 --> 3080.9599999999996
dramatic

3076.88 --> 3096.6400000000003
radioactive decay even if

3080.96 --> 3098.96
that it's not the same thing

3096.64 --> 3101.04
oh nuclear fission is considered also a

3098.96 --> 3103.52
radioactive decay oh

3101.04 --> 3105.68
okay then i got it mixed up i didn't

3103.52 --> 3105.68
know

3106.72 --> 3112.0789999999997
i thought that nuclear fission was

3108.4 --> 3116.2400000000002
specific to atomic explosion

3112.079 --> 3117.599
like a critical mass reaction

3116.24 --> 3120.24
so i might have mixed up the

3117.599 --> 3125.839
terminologies then

3120.24 --> 3125.839
i don't know i'm not a nuclear physicist

3133.28 --> 3138.7200000000003
but at least i think i got a basic

3135.119 --> 3142.0
understanding of it

3138.72 --> 3142.0
more than most probably

3143.359 --> 3156.0789999999997
right fission is supposed to be instant

3153.2 --> 3157.839
can be considered a re-radioactive waste

3156.079 --> 3158.559
well that depends on what actually

3157.839 --> 3162.4
happens

3158.559 --> 3165.599
andy says that really depends

3162.4 --> 3170.0
you can consider it radioactive waste or

3165.599 --> 3170.0
maybe it just stopped working

3172.8 --> 3176.8
it's decaying yeah well what did what

3174.559 --> 3180.48
does that mean

3176.8 --> 3182.319
maybe it just stops working giving off

3180.48 --> 3184.319
that the heat that actually boils the

3182.319 --> 3187.7599999999998
water and all that

3184.319 --> 3192.4
turns into slightly different material

3187.76 --> 3192.4
and that's it you can call it waste

3192.839 --> 3195.839
but

3201.68 --> 3207.04
i guess technically in the process it

3203.92 --> 3211.2000000000003
would be waste

3207.04 --> 3211.2
in the specific process

3213.599 --> 3218.6400000000003
for a long time slowly

3217.04 --> 3221.04
yeah well it doesn't really matter now

3218.64 --> 3237.839
does it because

3221.04 --> 3237.839
it doesn't really do anything

3241.359 --> 3246.16
no no it doesn't do as much as is

3248.839 --> 3251.839
proclaimed

3257.599 --> 3262.319
i think that certain levels of like

3260.16 --> 3263.2799999999997
highly concentrated radiation on a

3262.319 --> 3266.319
certain level

3263.28 --> 3267.52
like once they use for medical scanning

3266.319 --> 3270.72
and all that

3267.52 --> 3273.28
that if you are exposed to that

3270.72 --> 3275.2
too much that your body will undergo

3273.28 --> 3278.2400000000002
problems

3275.2 --> 3281.2799999999997
but i think that the general material

3278.24 --> 3285.2799999999997
they use in nuclear reactors

3281.28 --> 3285.28
are not that harmful compared

3289.359 --> 3294.0789999999997
is nuclear radiation harmful to human

3291.44 --> 3297.119
cells well

3294.079 --> 3300.079
it's complicated i think

3297.119 --> 3300.48
it's just not exactly as proclaimed it's

3300.079 --> 3303.599
like

3300.48 --> 3306.88
not all yeah god it's just

3303.599 --> 3308.96
dude why are you trying to like

3306.88 --> 3311.839
i'm not a nuclear physicist okay i

3308.96 --> 3311.839
haven't actually

3311.92 --> 3316.559
totally studied it i just i'm trying i

3314.72 --> 3321.839
basically just tried to size it up with

3316.559 --> 3321.8390000000004
all the new information

3328.0 --> 3333.76
so i think that in extreme

3331.04 --> 3336.319
amounts probably radiation could be

3333.76 --> 3336.3190000000004
harmful

3337.359 --> 3341.44
but yeah i don't think that's actually

3339.76 --> 3345.5200000000004
practically the case

3341.44 --> 3349.839
as much it's not as

3345.52 --> 3349.839
lethal as is claimed

3363.599 --> 3380.17
right jared sandford sure

3376.73 --> 3380.17
[Music]

3384.16 --> 3391.839
hey ryan arthurton

3401.04 --> 3406.16
nuclear is like space no no not

3416.839 --> 3422.24
exactly

3419.839 --> 3423.92
because space is just entirely

3422.24 --> 3427.68
impossible

3423.92 --> 3431.52
but yeah nuclear there is something

3427.68 --> 3433.839
to say for it it's just not exactly as

3431.52 --> 3433.839
claimed

3445.599 --> 3450.0
so yeah parts of it may be made up

3448.48 --> 3451.68
indeed and that's why

3450.0 --> 3453.68
that's what i'm trying to clear up but

3451.68 --> 3455.04
that doesn't mean it's all just nothing

3453.68 --> 3458.72
that they just

3455.04 --> 3460.64
took bricks of lead and then claims

3458.72 --> 3461.7599999999998
that it's all doing stuff and it's not

3460.64 --> 3463.839
like that

3461.76 --> 3465.2000000000003
pretty sure that radioactive material

3463.839 --> 3468.48
does exist

3465.2 --> 3472.72
it just doesn't do exactly what they say

3468.48 --> 3475.839
it does not in the way

3472.72 --> 3475.839
as they describe it

3477.119 --> 3480.96
and my best comparison to what that

3480.0 --> 3482.88
would be like

3480.96 --> 3486.2400000000002
is comparing it to the concept of

3482.88 --> 3489.44
viruses which are definitely not

3486.24 --> 3493.4399999999996
what they claim it is so there is

3489.44 --> 3496.16
something going on it's just not put

3493.44 --> 3497.28
in the context that they present to you

3496.16 --> 3500.16
see

3497.28 --> 3501.76
that's how i approach the nuclear

3500.16 --> 3503.7599999999998
situation

3501.76 --> 3505.92
i'm still in the process of figuring it

3503.76 --> 3507.119
out it's just there i just haven't

3505.92 --> 3509.44
really dealt with it

3507.119 --> 3509.44
a lot

3512.079 --> 3517.8390000000004
hey dark steve

3525.119 --> 3534.0
sea water to produce hydrogen

3530.24 --> 3538.5589999999997
oh you mean just

3534.0 --> 3543.2
yeah turning it into gas

3538.559 --> 3546.6400000000003
they fail at it okay

3543.2 --> 3546.64
if you say so i don't know

3551.76 --> 3555.2000000000003
i think they can it's just that

3553.74 --> 3559.839
[Music]

3555.2 --> 3559.839
they don't really like hydrogen gas

3561.04 --> 3564.64
it's been tried out it's mostly been

3563.04 --> 3567.359
discouraged everywhere

3564.64 --> 3569.839
serious like we had buses here in the

3567.359 --> 3573.119
netherlands that drove on hydrogen

3569.839 --> 3575.52
in a certain region and it was just

3573.119 --> 3577.599
always everybody everything complaining

3575.52 --> 3579.839
about it how bad it was

3577.599 --> 3580.96
supposedly the media was just not being

3579.839 --> 3584.16
positive about it

3580.96 --> 3586.799
at all and then it kind of like faded

3584.16 --> 3587.5989999999997
away to the side nobody even remembers

3586.799 --> 3590.96
that happened

3587.599 --> 3593.44
in the netherlands i always thought it

3590.96 --> 3601.839
was a great idea

3593.44 --> 3601.839
you can't get more clean than hydrogen

3630.64 --> 3643.839
got to be kidding me iron

3648.079 --> 3653.2000000000003
do i own any bitcoin yeah i got six

3650.96 --> 3657.04
million of them

3653.2 --> 3671.839
but i forgot like

3657.04 --> 3671.839
where i stored it might be broken

3672.96 --> 3685.839
yes earth passenger yes it is

3676.24 --> 3685.839
that's right

3706.319 --> 3714.5589999999997
what what

3710.64 --> 3714.5589999999997
what is this george sanford

3722.64 --> 3728.0789999999997
yes i heard you little wolves then

3736.799 --> 3741.839
right so where are you getting this

3738.079 --> 3741.8390000000004
information from george sanford

3766.839 --> 3769.839
um

3770.799 --> 3783.839
sand platinum iridium what

3774.72 --> 3783.839
like why sand that's weird

3790.559 --> 3796.1600000000003
sure well who knows yeah sure you could

3793.839 --> 3798.0
create hydrogen generators with solar

3796.16 --> 3800.64
panels and just let them make it

3798.0 --> 3810.16
sure there's all kinds of possibilities

3800.64 --> 3812.0
with that sort of thing

3810.16 --> 3813.2
although you got to realize though that

3812.0 --> 3816.72
hydrogen is

3813.2 --> 3819.839
like extremely volatile so

3816.72 --> 3822.3999999999996
in general storing it overall is not

3819.839 --> 3824.319
too good of an idea to have like big

3822.4 --> 3825.28
storage tanks filled with hydrogen

3824.319 --> 3829.2
everywhere it's

3825.28 --> 3832.48
kind of like extremely dangerous

3829.2 --> 3834.48
to have big storage like that so there's

3832.48 --> 3837.44
also systems where you could

3834.48 --> 3838.4
very rapidly just generate it in a spot

3837.44 --> 3842.559
and then put it

3838.4 --> 3846.7200000000003
into an engine or onto an engine just

3842.559 --> 3850.4
water in there you break it up

3846.72 --> 3852.72
on the spot and then inject the gases

3850.4 --> 3854.88
into the engine

3852.72 --> 3857.359
that's a much safer way to do it in my

3854.88 --> 3857.359
opinion

3859.52 --> 3863.7599999999998
yeah only if you add oxygen oh guess

3862.0 --> 3867.28
what guess what

3863.76 --> 3872.2400000000002
there's oxygen out here

3867.28 --> 3872.2400000000002
might have taken note of that so

3891.2 --> 3894.3999999999996
but i've always been a for a long time

3893.44 --> 3897.2000000000003
at least

3894.4 --> 3899.2000000000003
a proponent for the idea of literally

3897.2 --> 3902.16
engines running on water

3899.2 --> 3906.319
but because that water would literally

3902.16 --> 3909.359
be split up in a hydrogen generator

3906.319 --> 3909.599
interactively so that no preponderance

3909.359 --> 3912.16
of

3909.599 --> 3915.039
gases would be building up that could

3912.16 --> 3917.2799999999997
pose a danger and then inject those

3915.039 --> 3918.1600000000003
on the spot generated gases into the

3917.28 --> 3922.0
engine

3918.16 --> 3926.16
and then that way at the most incredibly

3922.0 --> 3929.119
efficient yeah

3926.16 --> 3930.96
fuel you can ever imagine and i've seen

3929.119 --> 3932.6400000000003
people do that

3930.96 --> 3935.039
and it's a great disappointment that

3932.64 --> 3937.5989999999997
it's not been standardized but yeah

3935.039 --> 3939.039
surprise surprise guess who's not gonna

3937.599 --> 3941.039
like that

3939.039 --> 3942.48
all the power industries are not gonna

3941.039 --> 3946.2400000000002
like that

3942.48 --> 3947.359
because yeah water is dirty cheap it's

3946.24 --> 3949.5989999999997
everywhere

3947.359 --> 3950.5589999999997
it's really easy and then suddenly no

3949.599 --> 3953.52
more need for

3950.559 --> 3954.7200000000003
any fuel not even biofuel you just take

3953.52 --> 3958.319
freaking water

3954.72 --> 3961.0389999999998
super efficient ex like no pollution

3958.319 --> 3962.319
at all no pollution right so they don't

3961.039 --> 3964.88
like that

3962.319 --> 3966.72
surprise surprise it's not standardized

3964.88 --> 3971.28
everything else

3966.72 --> 3974.9599999999996
is okay but that i've not seen any of it

3971.28 --> 3978.079
i've even seen like air pressure cars

3974.96 --> 3979.839
like little cars that just run on a tank

3978.079 --> 3980.799
of compressed air and they run pretty

3979.839 --> 3984.319
damn far on it

3980.799 --> 3988.24
like even that [ __ ] is has been in

3984.319 --> 3990.24
in production but not the

3988.24 --> 3992.0
life generate on the spot generated

3990.24 --> 3996.3999999999996
hydrogen engines

3992.0 --> 3996.4
not seen that very disappointing

4000.48 --> 4007.839
right george sanford he was killed oh

4004.839 --> 4007.839
goody

4012.799 --> 4023.359
when did that happen

4020.079 --> 4026.88
because i've seen videos of it

4023.359 --> 4028.319
pretty recently 90s oh right yeah that's

4026.88 --> 4035.839
that's an older

4028.319 --> 4035.839
guy no i've seen videos of that in 2015

4040.4 --> 4047.44
like new videos him basically

4043.92 --> 4050.2400000000002
live showing it

4047.44 --> 4050.2400000000002
in his car

4056.559 --> 4063.8390000000004
so it that that wasn't the end of it

4059.28 --> 4063.8390000000004
with stan myers

4083.72 --> 4089.2
[Music]

4086.079 --> 4090.079
right well that's the 90s maybe it's

4089.2 --> 4092.72
different now

4090.079 --> 4094.48
but we still have to get over the yeah

4092.72 --> 4096.5599999999995
the mega corporations trying to

4094.48 --> 4098.239
literally take over the world

4096.56 --> 4105.839000000001
you know because they're not going to

4098.239 --> 4105.839
help with any of that

4118.319 --> 4133.839000000001
hey here we go again

4136.96 --> 4147.13
hey that flat fellow thank you for the

4139.04 --> 4150.249
99 cent super chat donation

4147.13 --> 4150.249
[Music]

4152.319 --> 4161.359
wow 43 watching huh

4155.44 --> 4162.799
about that

4161.359 --> 4165.279
are you all missing the flat earth

4162.799 --> 4165.2789999999995
debates

4168.56 --> 4174.56
nathan popped by earlier and basically

4172.159 --> 4175.2789999999995
said that his computer had indeed broken

4174.56 --> 4178.719
down

4175.279 --> 4181.679
it's in repair

4178.719 --> 4183.6
but yeah it's very it's just it's not

4181.679 --> 4189.839
gonna be live today either so it's

4183.6 --> 4189.839
probably gonna be monday

4191.839 --> 4197.199
yeah the flat earth debate over at

4194.239 --> 4203.839999999999
nathan oakley 1980

4197.199 --> 4203.839999999999
that's right

4242.84 --> 4245.84
right

4250.88 --> 4259.84
you can debate if you like okay

4265.679 --> 4273.84
hmm oh you got a channel i didn't know

4270.84 --> 4273.84
that

4277.12 --> 4280.96
all right yeah michael jones could you

4278.8 --> 4282.719
post a link to that flat fellow's

4280.96 --> 4286.96
channel

4282.719 --> 4290.4
i'll check it out

4286.96 --> 4301.84
let's take some calls no

4290.4 --> 4301.839999999999
not really

4305.12 --> 4315.84
all right see you later men beardella

4322.159 --> 4327.12
oh okay earth passenger well

4325.36 --> 4329.839999999999
if you really think that then please

4327.12 --> 4329.84
support my channel

4332.56 --> 4337.360000000001
yeah could be that you think

4335.679 --> 4340.32
letter of debate is getting boring i

4337.36 --> 4340.32
don't really

4340.88 --> 4344.56
and i find it really stimulating to be

4343.04 --> 4345.92
part of the show

4344.56 --> 4347.52
not always though you know i'm not

4345.92 --> 4349.1990000000005
always in the mood for it too much and

4347.52 --> 4352.64
then it kind of stays silent

4349.199 --> 4355.44
sometimes it's just really good

4352.64 --> 4356.88
and yeah the guys we all have a history

4355.44 --> 4359.12
and we all

4356.88 --> 4360.2390000000005
remember it like when we're together we

4359.12 --> 4363.679
all remember it

4360.239 --> 4371.839999999999
if there's like this team spirit

4363.679 --> 4371.84
thing going that i'm part of

4373.04 --> 4376.96
but yeah you know it's flat earth it's

4375.52 --> 4378.56
focused on flat earth

4376.96 --> 4380.159
versus the globe so that's what it's

4378.56 --> 4382.2390000000005
focused on and

4380.159 --> 4384.08
yeah i am lucky to be able to talk about

4382.239 --> 4387.839999999999
whatever i like

4384.08 --> 4391.04
because i'm not flat earth only

4387.84 --> 4392.4800000000005
could you oh i don't know just me on my

4391.04 --> 4395.5199999999995
own talking about flat earth

4392.48 --> 4399.678999999999
every single day just that i don't

4395.52 --> 4401.4400000000005
that's not that's impossible

4399.679 --> 4403.4400000000005
now there's a lot to say about flat

4401.44 --> 4406.239
earth and everything concerning it but

4403.44 --> 4406.239
not that much

4410.88 --> 4427.84
oh wow all right flat fellow

4414.88 --> 4427.84
interesting that's a lot of flyers

4429.28 --> 4434.8
yes the you got a point there iron

4432.56 --> 4435.679
the quality of the globers have indeed

4434.8 --> 4439.12
dropped

4435.679 --> 4443.36
dramatically because they're

4439.12 --> 4445.44
yeah their tricks

4443.36 --> 4448.08
their suspense of disbelief tricks their

4445.44 --> 4451.678999999999
mind experiments are have just been

4448.08 --> 4454.719
blatantly obviously exposed and like put

4451.679 --> 4456.88
under the microscope level exposed

4454.719 --> 4458.96
and you can't really recover from that

4456.88 --> 4460.56
you can only just pretend it doesn't

4458.96 --> 4462.56
exist and go around it

4460.56 --> 4463.76
and at some point there is like no more

4462.56 --> 4467.84
maneuvering room

4463.76 --> 4470.56
left no more places you can go

4467.84 --> 4471.52
in a conversation in order to try to

4470.56 --> 4473.4400000000005
avoid

4471.52 --> 4474.8
all those things because they will be

4473.44 --> 4477.04
present everywhere

4474.8 --> 4479.12
and that's they're they've just run into

4477.04 --> 4480.84
a ditch

4479.12 --> 4483.84
there's nothing really left for the

4480.84 --> 4483.84
globe

4484.32 --> 4488.239
it's it's almost becoming irrelevant

4491.679 --> 4495.36
i don't think a lot about the mandela

4493.44 --> 4497.839999999999
effect

4495.36 --> 4500.159
i think it's it's i think it's

4497.84 --> 4502.8
psychological

4500.159 --> 4503.599999999999
i don't think there's a literal time

4502.8 --> 4507.679
shift or

4503.6 --> 4509.6
dimensional exchange going on

4507.679 --> 4511.84
although spiritually there might be some

4509.6 --> 4514.320000000001
really weird things

4511.84 --> 4516.4800000000005
but i don't i think that mandela the

4514.32 --> 4517.92
experience of it is purely psychological

4516.48 --> 4521.678999999999
and some of it is even quite

4517.92 --> 4526.08
easy to explain how that works

4521.679 --> 4529.76
it's just weird trickery of media people

4526.08 --> 4532.08
that make names

4529.76 --> 4534.159000000001
that are just slightly off and then

4532.08 --> 4536.159
instantly because you don't want to

4534.159 --> 4538.0
deal with that you just want to enjoy

4536.159 --> 4540.5599999999995
whatever you were enjoying

4538.0 --> 4541.44
you just forget about it and then you

4540.56 --> 4544.8
remember it

4541.44 --> 4545.44
the right way the way your mind wants it

4544.8 --> 4547.679
to be

4545.44 --> 4548.639999999999
and then everybody does that almost

4547.679 --> 4551.28
everybody

4548.64 --> 4553.6
everybody will start calling the show

4551.28 --> 4554.159
the way everybody feels it's supposed to

4553.6 --> 4557.120000000001
be

4554.159 --> 4559.839999999999
it's a weird thing and then later much

4557.12 --> 4567.84
later it might just turn out like

4559.84 --> 4567.84
well that's not how you write it at all

4568.56 --> 4571.84
and then everybody kind of forgot about

4570.719 --> 4573.92
it

4571.84 --> 4575.84
but it never was that way so i think

4573.92 --> 4576.719
that a lot of mandela effect comes from

4575.84 --> 4579.52
this

4576.719 --> 4580.08
i'm not saying that that is all there

4579.52 --> 4582.159000000001
might be

4580.08 --> 4584.0
some really weird things going on too

4582.159 --> 4586.719
that are slightly more complicated but i

4584.0 --> 4591.52
think most of it is routed in

4586.719 --> 4591.52
just weird sociology and psychology

4592.4 --> 4595.44
luke i am your father yeah i think i

4594.96 --> 4597.6
think

4595.44 --> 4598.639999999999
more and more and more that look i am

4597.6 --> 4601.1990000000005
your father

4598.64 --> 4603.1990000000005
is literally constructed in your own

4601.199 --> 4604.5599999999995
mind because that's what you really

4603.199 --> 4606.879999999999
wanted to hear that would be the

4604.56 --> 4609.6
strongest way to express it

4606.88 --> 4612.400000000001
but it was never said that way it's just

4609.6 --> 4615.84
how our memory

4612.4 --> 4618.0
quickly digs through what is confronted

4615.84 --> 4619.679
and then puts the pieces together that

4618.0 --> 4622.48
are the most memorable

4619.679 --> 4624.08
and then you remember it like that you

4622.48 --> 4627.12
see

4624.08 --> 4630.08
i've literally experienced that so

4627.12 --> 4630.08
i yeah

4630.239 --> 4637.839999999999
that's my opinion about it

4638.56 --> 4642.8
but i can't explain everything

4642.88 --> 4647.1990000000005
i i can't explain all the weirdness

4647.44 --> 4652.4
it's just a lot of the mandela claimed

4650.4 --> 4654.5599999999995
effects even the dramatics one

4652.4 --> 4655.839999999999
the dramatic ones i can explain like

4654.56 --> 4659.6
that because that

4655.84 --> 4659.6
is what the mind actually does with

4662.84 --> 4665.84
things

4668.01 --> 4673.41
[Music]

4670.88 --> 4674.719
it might also be a part of

4673.41 --> 4678.5599999999995
[Music]

4674.719 --> 4680.88
or part of or the origin of agitation

4678.56 --> 4684.64
tactics even in a way

4680.88 --> 4687.679
like do it slightly wrong on purpose

4684.64 --> 4689.92
so that people will make their own

4687.679 --> 4691.52
virtual image and apparently you can

4689.92 --> 4694.4800000000005
hang on very long

4691.52 --> 4696.56
on that virtual image the correction of

4694.48 --> 4699.678999999999
the slight mistake

4696.56 --> 4702.719
see so it's just weird

4699.679 --> 4704.88
sociology trickery i think that they've

4702.719 --> 4708.56
been using

4704.88 --> 4708.56
just the [ __ ] around experiment

4710.64 --> 4718.88
i don't think anything about that

4714.0 --> 4723.36
the weird earth passenger

4718.88 --> 4724.159000000001
it says simpson's pre-programming well

4723.36 --> 4727.92
this very

4724.159 --> 4730.4
easy everything everything that's

4727.92 --> 4730.4
out there

4731.28 --> 4738.719
is made by people that have connections

4735.44 --> 4740.96
with big agenda situations and big

4738.719 --> 4744.08
agenda situations happen

4740.96 --> 4747.36
multiple decades ahead of time

4744.08 --> 4750.159
the program is laid out multiple decades

4747.36 --> 4751.199
before it happens and these people knew

4750.159 --> 4763.839999999999
about it

4751.199 --> 4763.839999999999
and then played with that

4766.0 --> 4777.84
and it's a lot a lot of media

4770.64 --> 4777.84
series movies a lot of them

4783.679 --> 4790.64
maybe they're even supposed to do that

4787.36 --> 4793.28
as like an announcement as a covert

4790.64 --> 4793.92
reveal like uh it's just a cartoon but

4793.28 --> 4796.159
oh yeah

4793.92 --> 4798.2390000000005
here is basically an admission of what

4796.159 --> 4800.48
we're doing and what we're gonna do

4798.239 --> 4802.08
so we shared it with you oh you didn't

4800.48 --> 4804.639999999999
take it serious you thought it was just

4802.08 --> 4807.04
a cartoon oh well that's on you then

4804.64 --> 4810.639
you know might be something like that as

4807.04 --> 4810.639
well you don't really know it's

4811.44 --> 4814.48
you don't really know until the makers

4813.92 --> 4819.679
just

4814.48 --> 4833.839999999999
overtly tell you did they

4819.679 --> 4833.84
you know

4836.56 --> 4840.8
what are you talking about that fat

4844.84 --> 4847.84
fellow

4849.28 --> 4855.44
i can't talk about it excuse me

4852.96 --> 4857.12
what do you mean i can't talk about it i

4855.44 --> 4859.199
talked about it a lot

4857.12 --> 4860.639
it's just i'm not gonna make my entire

4859.199 --> 4863.199
show about that i'm not gonna make

4860.639 --> 4864.32
special boy videos trying to warn

4863.199 --> 4866.879999999999
everybody

4864.32 --> 4867.84
or pretend like i am a medical doctor or

4866.88 --> 4871.36
anything

4867.84 --> 4874.56
right but i've talked plenty about masks

4871.36 --> 4876.639
confinement it's all absurd it's illegal

4874.56 --> 4882.320000000001
it's unconstitutional in every

4876.639 --> 4886.08
country except dictatorships

4882.32 --> 4889.36
which might include england

4886.08 --> 4891.36
so it seems right

4889.36 --> 4892.719
so yeah i can't talk about it it's all

4891.36 --> 4895.04
ridiculous

4892.719 --> 4896.88
like i don't think viruses are real i

4895.04 --> 4899.36
think virus theory

4896.88 --> 4900.32
has is not legitimate it's not a

4899.36 --> 4904.679
scientific

4900.32 --> 4908.0
proven valid theory it's just a concept

4904.679 --> 4911.4400000000005
extrapolated from

4908.0 --> 4913.92
germ theory put inside

4911.44 --> 4915.678999999999
germ theory alongside it it's not real

4913.92 --> 4919.1990000000005
though i don't think it is real i don't

4915.679 --> 4919.1990000000005
think anything about it is real

4919.76 --> 4928.84
so yeah i think it's all a massive

4923.44 --> 4932.08
global hoax medical industrial

4928.84 --> 4933.679
complex conspiracy together with media

4932.08 --> 4937.04
and governments

4933.679 --> 4940.08
to try and create a well like a

4937.04 --> 4943.44
yeah a medical tyranny

4940.08 --> 4944.0
to move their towards more and more

4943.44 --> 4947.839999999999
towards

4944.0 --> 4951.12
the neo-feudal technocratic system

4947.84 --> 4954.56
that the controllers all these

4951.12 --> 4956.639
super billionaires and all that

4954.56 --> 4958.8
highly mighty people that meet at the

4956.639 --> 4960.159000000001
davos and the bilderberg and all that's

4958.8 --> 4961.1990000000005
what they kind of wanted that's what

4960.159 --> 4966.638999999999
they

4961.199 --> 4966.638999999999
put their efforts towards

4969.6 --> 4973.360000000001
that's what it is so what do you mean i

4971.92 --> 4976.4800000000005
can't talk about it

4973.36 --> 4979.28
i've talked about it my channel's here

4976.48 --> 4980.799999999999
i have not had a strike i the times i

4979.28 --> 4982.48
talk about it they don't even get

4980.8 --> 4985.6
demonetized

4982.48 --> 4989.44
so just

4985.6 --> 4991.6
no i can talk about it

4989.44 --> 5001.839999999999
i just don't really like talking about

4991.6 --> 5001.84
it because it annoys the [ __ ] out of me

5002.88 --> 5007.28
but yeah i agree the

5008.639 --> 5017.36
the mask situation and

5012.719 --> 5020.4800000000005
the lockdowns are absolutely criminal

5017.36 --> 5025.12
just there's no justification for it

5020.48 --> 5025.12
but the way they arranged it

5025.28 --> 5030.88
just makes it complicated

5028.32 --> 5033.599999999999
because they have like very well thought

5030.88 --> 5036.2390000000005
out judicial backing

5033.6 --> 5038.96
for it for how it works how where the

5036.239 --> 5041.36
responsibility lies

5038.96 --> 5042.4
so in a way they're basically giving it

5041.36 --> 5046.08
delusion

5042.4 --> 5049.5199999999995
out like it is all monolithic top down

5046.08 --> 5052.88
it's not though it actually isn't

5049.52 --> 5055.679
and everybody that's basically

5052.88 --> 5057.04
acting along with it is doing it by

5055.679 --> 5060.08
their own volition

5057.04 --> 5063.12
out of some contract or whatever

5060.08 --> 5066.719
money in some way

5063.12 --> 5069.76
to help pretend it is all monolithic

5066.719 --> 5070.08
and it isn't it's one giant pyramid scam

5069.76 --> 5073.4400000000005
it

5070.08 --> 5075.28
it yeah it literally is a giant pyramid

5073.44 --> 5078.96
scam

5075.28 --> 5081.199
the corona situation the biggest ever

5078.96 --> 5081.199
seen

5082.639 --> 5087.12
but it is structured like a pyramid scam

5085.199 --> 5089.759999999999
it's like none of it is real

5087.12 --> 5092.0
people play into it and then also have

5089.76 --> 5094.639
to uphold it's real

5092.0 --> 5096.48
and other people just get mentally

5094.639 --> 5098.2390000000005
caught into it they really think it's

5096.48 --> 5100.718999999999
real and then they turn into

5098.239 --> 5102.32
masked karens and freaks and all that

5100.719 --> 5103.679
and they literally lose their business

5102.32 --> 5105.92
and then they're like oh

5103.679 --> 5106.96
oh i couldn't do anything about this oh

5105.92 --> 5113.84
it's just corona

5106.96 --> 5113.84
and they yeah fade away

5123.6 --> 5127.120000000001
youtube rules i imagine well yeah you

5125.679 --> 5130.08
did imagine it

5127.12 --> 5130.96
because it doesn't work it's not working

5130.08 --> 5134.239
with me

5130.96 --> 5138.0
i'm talking about it i'm saying it is

5134.239 --> 5141.04
fake like yeah it's fake it's fake

5138.0 --> 5144.8
nothing that they say about it is real

5141.04 --> 5147.84
i don't think viruses even exist the way

5144.8 --> 5148.56
they say or the medical system says it

5147.84 --> 5151.1990000000005
does i

5148.56 --> 5151.92
literally don't believe viruses exist

5151.199 --> 5155.44
any of it

5151.92 --> 5156.08
anymore it's just not what they say it

5155.44 --> 5159.5199999999995
is

5156.08 --> 5163.199
doesn't work that way ever it's all

5159.52 --> 5166.320000000001
a model based assumption system

5163.199 --> 5169.678999999999
that they just made everybody believe

5166.32 --> 5172.239
oh where's that familiar yeah

5169.679 --> 5174.08
kind of like the globe oh that's why in

5172.239 --> 5176.799999999999
a lot of science fiction you see

5174.08 --> 5177.6
viruses what science fiction theory

5176.8 --> 5179.76
nowadays

5177.6 --> 5182.159000000001
is out there that does not have an

5179.76 --> 5184.639
episode about some damn freaking virus

5182.159 --> 5186.799999999999
and they make it extra horror

5184.639 --> 5188.2390000000005
extra in your face physical oh look at

5186.8 --> 5190.719
the horror

5188.239 --> 5192.08
to make you scared of viruses because

5190.719 --> 5195.28
it's a part of the scam

5192.08 --> 5198.88
viruses are a part of that scam of a

5195.28 --> 5201.599999999999
fake conjured concept to control

5198.88 --> 5201.6
everybody with

5202.48 --> 5209.04
yeah guess what i said it

5206.08 --> 5209.04
in january

5209.199 --> 5213.28
that's when i said it i was still kind

5211.04 --> 5215.48
of nervous about it nothing happened

5213.28 --> 5217.759999999999
nothing happened no strike no

5215.48 --> 5225.839999999999
demonetization

5217.76 --> 5225.84
still going

5228.239 --> 5235.839999999999
you figure it out why i don't know why

5232.4 --> 5240.5599999999995
this is yeah that's right

5235.84 --> 5244.719
it's fake it's not what they say it is

5240.56 --> 5248.2390000000005
it's not a viral infection of a

5244.719 --> 5249.199
sub bacterial entity that invades your

5248.239 --> 5253.44
body and spreads

5249.199 --> 5256.719
no every time with viruses it's always

5253.44 --> 5257.44
general conditions and then the body

5256.719 --> 5260.639
just

5257.44 --> 5264.96
basically gets triggered and

5260.639 --> 5264.96
yeah destroys itself

5265.28 --> 5270.48
but there's just very likely there's

5267.36 --> 5273.759999999999
some kind of poisoning going on

5270.48 --> 5276.159
when that happens so i don't know

5273.76 --> 5278.639
exactly what's going on with this ebola

5276.159 --> 5281.679
situation but it's just not a freaking

5278.639 --> 5284.719
virus because they don't exist

5281.679 --> 5284.719
doesn't work like that

5288.32 --> 5294.32
and the same even goes for aids

5291.76 --> 5296.400000000001
it's fake too everything that is

5294.32 --> 5300.799999999999
directly correlated to viruses

5296.4 --> 5300.799999999999
is just not that it just isn't

5301.199 --> 5304.4
all right see you later roger

5304.88 --> 5312.08
now for example things like uh herpes

5308.08 --> 5315.44
they say it is a virus too right

5312.08 --> 5318.8
well herpes does exist

5315.44 --> 5320.638999999999
i had yeah i have lip issues i've had i

5318.8 --> 5321.52
haven't had it in a long time by the way

5320.639 --> 5324.96
i noticed

5321.52 --> 5328.0
so there is something there is it a

5324.96 --> 5330.719
virus why do they say

5328.0 --> 5332.56
did they get the virus particles and oh

5330.719 --> 5334.719
so they found some correlation that when

5332.56 --> 5336.56
that happens then virus particles start

5334.719 --> 5339.76
cleaning up [ __ ] again right

5336.56 --> 5345.1990000000005
that's how they conclude that

5339.76 --> 5347.4400000000005
is it infectious well it seems to be

5345.199 --> 5348.4
when it basically gets in the blooming

5347.44 --> 5352.32
stage and all that

5348.4 --> 5356.799999999999
does that mean it is a virus

5352.32 --> 5359.92
no it's probably something else

5356.8 --> 5365.84
and it's weird i don't know

5359.92 --> 5365.84
what it is

5365.92 --> 5369.4400000000005
there is an element of bacteria an

5367.84 --> 5371.679
element oh that's

5369.44 --> 5373.44
that's very specific an element of

5371.679 --> 5377.52
bacteria or

5373.44 --> 5380.638999999999
okay i don't know i just know it exists

5377.52 --> 5382.400000000001
and i know that viruses don't exist

5380.639 --> 5383.92
in the model that they say it does

5382.4 --> 5387.5199999999995
viruses are a secondary

5383.92 --> 5390.84
response mechanism in the metabolism

5387.52 --> 5392.719
on a cellular level in the

5390.84 --> 5395.92
microbiological

5392.719 --> 5398.08
things that transpire in the body so

5395.92 --> 5400.8
there is that thing going on it is

5398.08 --> 5402.0
sort of infectious but it also seems

5400.8 --> 5403.1990000000005
that

5402.0 --> 5405.84
this is something that even owen

5403.199 --> 5408.5599999999995
benjamin addressed that it mo

5405.84 --> 5409.28
like you get more herpes when you have

5408.56 --> 5411.679
more

5409.28 --> 5411.679
sex

5414.0 --> 5418.32
so it's like maybe a squirting side

5416.56 --> 5420.4800000000005
effect as it were

5418.32 --> 5421.44
and i have to concur in my experience

5420.48 --> 5423.678999999999
yeah

5421.44 --> 5427.199
when i'm more sexually active that's

5423.679 --> 5427.1990000000005
when it for some reason gets

5427.44 --> 5431.919999999999
starts to appear sometimes it's really

5429.6 --> 5434.8
annoying

5431.92 --> 5435.92
but i haven't had any of it in a long

5434.8 --> 5438.08
time

5435.92 --> 5439.52
well i haven't had any sexual activity

5438.08 --> 5443.44
in a long time

5439.52 --> 5443.4400000000005
with others and i like

5449.6 --> 5453.4400000000005
there's owen when benjamin would

5451.44 --> 5455.36
describe keeping my ball strong

5453.44 --> 5456.5599999999995
because i i don't really watch porn

5455.36 --> 5459.839999999999
anymore

5456.56 --> 5462.159000000001
very very rarely now

5459.84 --> 5463.84
i'm not like i'm never doing it again

5462.159 --> 5466.5599999999995
because hello

5463.84 --> 5467.04
hello i still have urges sometimes you

5466.56 --> 5470.159000000001
know it's

5467.04 --> 5470.88
too much information or something but i

5470.159 --> 5474.32
just

5470.88 --> 5474.32
i'm dramatically

5474.56 --> 5482.400000000001
lessening it have been for some time

5478.96 --> 5485.36
and it's been good and i have not had

5482.4 --> 5487.36
any kind of sign of herpes so maybe

5485.36 --> 5491.759999999999
there is a direct correlation it's

5487.36 --> 5497.839999999999
it's still kind of a mystery how

5491.76 --> 5497.84
how it works but it's not a virus

5498.48 --> 5507.44
not in the in the sense as they describe

5503.04 --> 5509.44
so yeah and with ebola

5507.44 --> 5511.28
it it can't be that too because that's

5509.44 --> 5512.5599999999995
just not how viruses work so there is

5511.28 --> 5519.84
some other thing that

5512.56 --> 5519.84
should be going on then

5521.679 --> 5525.679
how long have you had everybody i've had

5523.36 --> 5528.88
it since i was six

5525.679 --> 5532.0
will it eventually go away well

5528.88 --> 5535.1990000000005
yeah as i said

5532.0 --> 5537.76
i've hadn't had it in a long time and

5535.199 --> 5539.839999999999
even when something like it pops up it's

5537.76 --> 5542.400000000001
so small

5539.84 --> 5547.84
it's it's usually not even visible

5542.4 --> 5547.839999999999
anymore so

5548.8 --> 5556.400000000001
now is it going to disappear forever

5552.239 --> 5559.678999999999
i don't know i don't know

5556.4 --> 5562.08
because i don't exactly know what it is

5559.679 --> 5564.719
there is also an addressal of it by the

5562.08 --> 5568.4
way through germany medicine

5564.719 --> 5571.44
there's other ways to conceive of it but

5568.4 --> 5573.679
haven't really studied deeply in on that

5571.44 --> 5577.599999999999
because hey i just don't have it i

5573.679 --> 5577.6
haven't really had it in a long time

5579.84 --> 5586.56
maybe also just eating

5582.88 --> 5589.84
much better food has an influence on how

5586.56 --> 5589.84
dramatic it gets

5600.0 --> 5604.32
there's an amount of bacteria with it an

5602.159 --> 5606.4
element what let yet look

5604.32 --> 5607.759999999999
there may be all all kinds of things

5606.4 --> 5611.28
going on once

5607.76 --> 5612.88
like it starts to express the symptoms

5611.28 --> 5614.88
that doesn't mean that all those things

5612.88 --> 5618.639
like bacteria or whatever is going on

5614.88 --> 5622.639
are the cause you see

5618.639 --> 5622.639
that's it's just a correlative thing

5627.04 --> 5630.239
yeah well here we go i don't think it

5629.199 --> 5632.11
really exists

5630.239 --> 5634.159
either

5632.11 --> 5636.96
[Music]

5634.159 --> 5637.92
no it's it's well maybe something exists

5636.96 --> 5641.04
that state

5637.92 --> 5644.08
or whatever how they detect it but

5641.04 --> 5659.84
it's just not it doesn't work

5644.08 --> 5659.84
the way they say it does

5666.0 --> 5669.679
and yeah when you look at the

5667.44 --> 5670.799999999999
correlations if even of aids and all

5669.679 --> 5675.84
that it seems to be

5670.8 --> 5679.12
just from yeah

5675.84 --> 5682.639
like it's side effects of

5679.12 --> 5683.36
bad having getting a very bad condition

5682.639 --> 5686.4800000000005
because of

5683.36 --> 5690.4
for example anal sex

5686.48 --> 5690.4
the potential damage that does

5690.719 --> 5698.2390000000005
that that kind of triggers that state

5694.8 --> 5701.84
but to call it a virus that's just

5698.239 --> 5701.839999999999
yeah there's no proof

5708.719 --> 5714.0
it's an injection of an evil spirit yeah

5711.119 --> 5717.759999999999
well yeah

5714.0 --> 5720.32
don't know you could see it as such

5717.76 --> 5721.360000000001
what are your thoughts on crystals and

5720.32 --> 5723.5199999999995
crystal therapy

5721.36 --> 5725.199
crystals are great i got a lot of them

5723.52 --> 5726.2390000000005
i've been collecting them for a long

5725.199 --> 5727.839999999999
long time

5726.239 --> 5730.159
since it was like one of my first

5727.84 --> 5733.84
collection hobbies

5730.159 --> 5736.159
even before i discovered legos

5733.84 --> 5737.360000000001
or maybe like during the same time

5736.159 --> 5741.599999999999
before i i got

5737.36 --> 5746.32
into crystals and gems before i got

5741.6 --> 5749.280000000001
into com into computers

5746.32 --> 5751.36
i got i got lots of them i showed some

5749.28 --> 5754.159
of them on my show

5751.36 --> 5757.839999999999
and crystal therapy yeah i do definitely

5754.159 --> 5757.839999999999
believe in

5758.239 --> 5763.44
crystal influences like influences on

5761.6 --> 5766.56
electrostatics you could

5763.44 --> 5768.799999999999
say it on the electric ether on the

5766.56 --> 5770.0
the level of how where the spirit energy

5768.8 --> 5773.679
is yeah it gets

5770.0 --> 5776.719
a little vague but i've utilized it

5773.679 --> 5776.719
and i can feel it

5777.119 --> 5781.92
so i've always been a believer in

5779.92 --> 5783.4400000000005
crystal therapy

5781.92 --> 5785.84
but you got to be sharp in your

5783.44 --> 5785.839999999999
intuition

5787.76 --> 5799.84
huh hiv drugs cause age i heard that too

5791.84 --> 5799.84
hold on i'll be back in two minutes

5906.17 --> 5910.719
[Music]

5908.84 --> 5925.84
what

5910.719 --> 5925.84
all right see you later iron

5934.08 --> 5939.84
yeah what are you talking about

5947.52 --> 5950.320000000001
that's freaky

5950.719 --> 5954.719
the over three weeks couldn't eat

5964.84 --> 5967.84
hmm

5971.98 --> 5975.16
[Music]

5979.28 --> 5984.148999999999
hmm

5981.09 --> 5984.149
[Music]

5987.61 --> 5991.599999999999
[Music]

6000.719 --> 6004.4
okay here we go again well look from

6003.84 --> 6007.119000000001
what i've

6004.4 --> 6008.08
understood of what supposedly aids and

6007.119 --> 6010.96
all that is is

6008.08 --> 6012.719
basically your immune system collapse

6010.96 --> 6014.2390000000005
like that is what happens then they

6012.719 --> 6018.4
attribute it to all the

6014.239 --> 6020.5599999999995
virus gets in the immune cells and

6018.4 --> 6022.159
makes them non-functional or consumes

6020.56 --> 6025.1990000000005
them destroys them

6022.159 --> 6027.92
right that's the idea well it may simply

6025.199 --> 6029.799999999999
be just a total

6027.92 --> 6031.1990000000005
immune system collapse due to

6029.8 --> 6035.1990000000005
[Music]

6031.199 --> 6037.28
extreme demoralization and poisoning

6035.199 --> 6039.678999999999
like literally like the body just is

6037.28 --> 6041.04
like yeah we can't handle this anymore

6039.679 --> 6042.8
we're just not gonna deal with it

6041.04 --> 6045.44
anymore

6042.8 --> 6051.84
something like that yeah that'll get you

6045.44 --> 6051.839999999999
sick as hell

6058.96 --> 6066.639
all right what did you post there

6063.199 --> 6066.638999999999
and why did it even show up

6068.159 --> 6079.839999999999
how are you even able to post that

6084.08 --> 6090.32
wow that's weird well they did say at

6087.92 --> 6092.32
some point remember

6090.32 --> 6093.5199999999995
suppose i heard this in the earlier

6092.32 --> 6096.0
phase that

6093.52 --> 6097.4400000000005
was supposedly the virus was a hybrid

6096.0 --> 6101.28
with hiv

6097.44 --> 6106.799999999999
and all kinds of things so maybe that's

6101.28 --> 6108.88
what that relates to

6106.8 --> 6111.6
why they got the false positive results

6108.88 --> 6111.6
for hiv

6113.04 --> 6121.84
very very odd

6146.0 --> 6150.159
right yeah that's that's right it would

6149.28 --> 6153.5199999999995
look

6150.159 --> 6156.96
virus tests are a bunk in general

6153.52 --> 6156.96
it's completely pointless

6157.119 --> 6163.28
it's completely pointless

6160.239 --> 6166.5599999999995
it's way too hard

6163.28 --> 6166.5599999999995
to test it quickly

6169.199 --> 6174.719
and there's no point to it because it

6172.4 --> 6175.28
should be noted that just the supposed

6174.719 --> 6178.88
virus

6175.28 --> 6179.679
entities are just not what it what they

6178.88 --> 6183.1990000000005
think it is

6179.679 --> 6186.96
it's a side effect it's not a cause

6183.199 --> 6189.5199999999995
that should just be accepted

6186.96 --> 6191.04
and the virus theory discarded but

6189.52 --> 6204.400000000001
they're not doing it

6191.04 --> 6206.96
so they don't want to let this one go

6204.4 --> 6208.48
alter your dna so you become a chimera

6206.96 --> 6212.08
yet that's

6208.48 --> 6219.839999999999
i heard the rumors i haven't

6212.08 --> 6219.84
seen any proof of that though

6239.5 --> 6242.6
[Music]

6266.239 --> 6271.839999999999
hmm yeah iron i might have seen that one

6269.92 --> 6274.2390000000005
there's been a lot of doctors talking

6271.84 --> 6277.1990000000005
about like uh

6274.239 --> 6278.0
virus versus terrain theory and all that

6277.199 --> 6279.759999999999
in a recent

6278.0 --> 6281.119
year yeah in the last year has been a

6279.76 --> 6283.6
lot of it and i've

6281.119 --> 6285.44
i've seen most of them once they're

6283.6 --> 6288.56
really good

6285.44 --> 6303.599999999999
they're all removed though eventually

6288.56 --> 6308.56
but i've seen it

6303.6 --> 6308.56
humanized mouse cells rna changes oh

6314.84 --> 6317.84
goody

6328.84 --> 6331.84
hmm

6332.48 --> 6337.919999999999
it's gonna be pretty screwed up like if

6335.679 --> 6339.1990000000005
if that really hap is that's really

6337.92 --> 6344.719
going down

6339.199 --> 6347.04
if it actually just alters the genetics

6344.719 --> 6350.4
like there's just gonna be some messed

6347.04 --> 6352.719
up [ __ ] going down when that happens

6350.4 --> 6353.759999999999
because they'll be whatever part of the

6352.719 --> 6355.28
group

6353.76 --> 6357.6
and then at some point there's just

6355.28 --> 6359.44
going to be people

6357.6 --> 6361.76
that are going to make a legal case that

6359.44 --> 6364.96
they're not human

6361.76 --> 6364.96
and then yeah

6366.8 --> 6370.320000000001
then they're just permanently [ __ ] all

6369.119 --> 6372.48
of it

6370.32 --> 6374.4
be like oh you got that oh well that

6372.48 --> 6376.239
means

6374.4 --> 6378.638999999999
yeah you don't have any human rights

6376.239 --> 6378.638999999999
anymore

6379.119 --> 6382.159
might even be claimed not even under god

6381.44 --> 6384.839999999999
because you

6382.159 --> 6386.5599999999995
yeah because you let you're no longer

6384.84 --> 6389.92
human

6386.56 --> 6389.92
it might get that crazy

6392.08 --> 6396.96
that's why i'm definitely not taking it

6394.639 --> 6399.28
ever

6396.96 --> 6401.36
i don't like to say i'll die first i'd

6399.28 --> 6403.679
like to say no i'll kill you

6401.36 --> 6403.679

6407.36 --> 6410.5599999999995
yeah what's up with nathan show his

6506.86 --> 6510.0199999999995
[Music]

6511.36 --> 6514.5599999999995
yeah we're all getting a little

6512.719 --> 6516.56
withdrawal symptoms there here we go

6514.56 --> 6519.04
again you know that

6516.56 --> 6519.04
i am

6523.36 --> 6528.799999999999
and i don't know either if nathan has

6526.56 --> 6532.56
like a replays plan so it could be that

6528.8 --> 6532.56
just there's gonna be a vacuum now

6533.28 --> 6536.719
because i don't know if he's able to i

6536.239 --> 6538.839999999999

know

6544.0 --> 6555.679
if he can do that

6554.08 --> 6558.4
there's a good chance he won't be able

6555.679 --> 6561.52
to because probably

6558.4 --> 6564.638999999999
the data storage disks on which he

6561.52 --> 6566.400000000001
recorded the videos are now also in at

6564.639 --> 6568.56
the repairman so it could be there's

6566.4 --> 6583.04
just not going to be any premieres

6568.56 --> 6588.4800000000005
until he's back online

6667.98 --> 6671.15
[Music]

6675.28 --> 6681.84
apologize for what

6690.719 --> 6699.52
hurting his feelings oh that's cute

6695.52 --> 6701.92
slander or doxing but how did he do that

6699.52 --> 6702.88
and what slander what did nathan ever

6701.92 --> 6709.84
slander him with

6702.88 --> 6709.84
but with the truth

6721.52 --> 6726.080000000001
you don't have any info well you do have

6723.84 --> 6728.8
info because you know what he was doing

6726.08 --> 6730.32
so i take it you know what he is

6728.8 --> 6737.84
supposedly suing

6730.32 --> 6737.84
nathan for right so what

6739.119 --> 6742.639
or is this just a baseless [ __ ]

6741.28 --> 6744.639
threat like

6742.639 --> 6747.4400000000005
i don't allow you to talk about me

6744.639 --> 6750.08
because i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] and a liar

6747.44 --> 6751.839999999999
and an idiot that'll disclaim the

6750.08 --> 6754.239
horizon to be the physical edge of a

6751.84 --> 6755.76
sphere and then reclaim it in the same

6754.239 --> 6765.839999999999
sentence

6755.76 --> 6765.84
that's all i know well that's not a lot

6767.199 --> 6769.598999999999
thanks

6776.96 --> 6779.76
hey voice

6790.84 --> 6798.719
right has anybody seen obermuckle around

6796.56 --> 6801.04
by the way i haven't seen him in a long

6798.719 --> 6801.04
time

6801.52 --> 6807.84
i hope he's doing all right

6819.84 --> 6824.08
i hope nothing bad happened to him or

6821.679 --> 6824.08
something

6830.08 --> 6836.719
right yeah here we go again found

6833.679 --> 6840.4
his channel he's got like a big

6836.719 --> 6843.76
hashtag mifa hat and a red hat

6840.4 --> 6846.5599999999995
it's pretty cool as an icon but yeah

6843.76 --> 6848.719
nobody seemed to have heard from him in

6846.56 --> 6852.080000000001
a while

6848.719 --> 6852.08
or him or her i don't know

6852.239 --> 6863.839999999999
i don't even i'm not even sure

6874.84 --> 6877.84
hmm

6878.8 --> 6883.28
because yeah it kind of dropped off

6881.199 --> 6883.919999999999
after i got pissed off that one time

6883.28 --> 6887.28
with

6883.92 --> 6889.92
the bob situation in chat

6887.28 --> 6891.36
but yeah i really hope he didn't leave

6889.92 --> 6894.96
because of that because that

6891.36 --> 6898.33
was just more the shock it wasn't meant

6894.96 --> 6899.599
like i wasn't really angry i was just

6898.33 --> 6903.04
[Music]

6899.599 --> 6904.32
it was just the moment but yeah you guys

6903.04 --> 6906.239
know that i think

6904.32 --> 6907.5199999999995
i even addressed it yeah about the range

6906.239 --> 6911.04
but i gave it back

6907.52 --> 6911.040000000001
i literally gave it back

6913.04 --> 6918.719
i think i would give it back if he'd

6915.52 --> 6921.84
come back

6918.719 --> 6924.32
but it was kind of like sloppy

6921.84 --> 6924.32
in a way

6925.36 --> 6929.28
but it's yeah i was just it was in a

6928.08 --> 6932.239
time when i was

6929.28 --> 6934.8
pretty yeah i was still kind of filled

6932.239 --> 6936.4
with all this rage energy and all that

6934.8 --> 6938.2390000000005
and it might have blown out a little bit

6936.4 --> 6947.839999999999
too hard

6938.239 --> 6947.839999999999
so but yeah i don't know if it's that

6953.199 --> 6964.48
you gave it back did i give it back

6961.36 --> 6966.639
if i haven't yet i would give it back

6964.48 --> 6969.5199999999995
because it was just it was just the

6966.639 --> 6975.84
timing and the situation

6969.52 --> 6975.84
yes i did okay okay right

6977.44 --> 6982.5599999999995
it's been it's been a while

6980.639 --> 6984.96
but anyway i think i'm gonna round out

6982.56 --> 6989.1990000000005
the show soon

6984.96 --> 6991.199
let me go for five more minutes

6989.199 --> 6992.5599999999995
that's fine afterwards right i thought

6991.199 --> 6995.5199999999995
so so i hope

6992.56 --> 6995.52
nothing bad happened

7000.32 --> 7003.84
all right

7028.84 --> 7031.84
what

7036.159 --> 7039.04

7042.159 --> 7059.839999999999
of nowhere

7044.239 --> 7059.839999999999
don't worry about it

7065.92 --> 7073.84
it doesn't seem fair

7078.639 --> 7085.1990000000005
right i remember that that's kind of

7082.639 --> 7087.599
what i'm worried about like i hope

7085.199 --> 7088.5599999999995
like that didn't make him lose trust in

7087.599 --> 7090.96
me or something

7088.56 --> 7093.280000000001
my integrity because it didn't it's just

please also do support me through the

7149.76 --> 7153.84
paypal patreon the super chat and the

7151.76 --> 7156.2390000000005
membership system join button

7153.84 --> 7157.1990000000005
that would be much appreciated i can i

7156.239 --> 7161.28
kind of

7157.199 --> 7163.919999999999
can use some paypal support i

7161.28 --> 7166.0
yeah because i'm running out of tobacco

7163.92 --> 7168.84
i need to order some new

7166.0 --> 7171.84
but that's actually kind of expensive

7168.84 --> 7171.84
like

7172.32 --> 7176.5599999999995
yeah because i basically have to order

7174.639 --> 7178.639
for like a year

7176.56 --> 7179.92
in one go now that's gonna save me a lot

7178.639 --> 7183.599
of money

7179.92 --> 7186.88
but it's still like this time i yeah

7183.599 --> 7188.8
it's gonna be like 150 euros and then i

7186.88 --> 7190.2390000000005
probably got enough for like an entire

7188.8 --> 7192.8
year

7190.239 --> 7194.799999999999
uh but yeah that's a little steep so i

7192.8 --> 7196.159000000001
could really use some extra support to

7194.8 --> 7198.56
basically

7196.159 --> 7200.879999999999
be able to engage with that without

7198.56 --> 7204.159000000001
getting hungry

7200.88 --> 7204.159000000001
halfway the next month

7205.04 --> 7208.639
uh it's still gonna take a long time for

7208.32 --> 7211.119
it

7208.639 --> 7212.8
to arrive also so i really kind of need

7211.119 --> 7214.159
to order it quickly

7212.8 --> 7216.400000000001
and then hopefully there's not going to

7214.159 --> 7218.638999999999
be like a three months delay like there

7216.4 --> 7220.638999999999
was last time

7218.639 --> 7222.400000000001
so anyway yeah please do support me

7220.639 --> 7222.8
especially through the paypal that would

7222.4 --> 7226.32
help

7222.8 --> 7229.92
a lot keep things rolling

7226.32 --> 7233.199
uh right i will be back tomorrow with

7229.92 --> 7236.719
flat earth early bird number 751

7233.199 --> 7240.32
on the saturday and

7236.719 --> 7242.2390000000005
yeah no flat earth debate unfortunately

7240.32 --> 7244.32
i think there might be a ball buster's

7242.239 --> 7249.28
life tomorrow too

7244.32 --> 7249.28
i don't know figure it out then uh

7250.0 --> 7268.23
right and until the next video

7254.08 --> 7288.47
