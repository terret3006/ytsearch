92.72 --> 98.15899999999999
from yesterday

94.88 --> 98.83999999999999
the yeah there was some serious snow

98.159 --> 101.759
here

98.84 --> 104.72
yesterday after my show ended

101.759 --> 105.36
i already said hey it's starting to snow

104.72 --> 107.36
well it

105.36 --> 109.439
it continued pretty much the entire

107.36 --> 113.52
evening

109.439 --> 115.52
and wow it's all melted now

113.52 --> 118.56
because yeah in the evening it was all

115.52 --> 121.759
white like literally all of it

118.56 --> 125.04
so like i think three centimeters

121.759 --> 127.2
maybe more and it was

125.04 --> 128.399
yeah you were seeing all kinds of people

127.2 --> 130.64000000000001
outside

128.399 --> 131.68
fooling around with snow like a lot of

130.64 --> 133.76
kids

131.68 --> 135.36
throw snowballs everywhere because there

133.76 --> 137.84
was just a lot of snow

135.36 --> 137.84
everywhere

140.48 --> 145.28
yeah and i had to go grocery shopping

142.72 --> 145.28
through that

146.72 --> 151.35999999999999
and yeah you might think oh that's

148.319 --> 153.599
beautiful well when you're on a bike

151.36 --> 155.36
yeah and i didn't have like glasses or

153.599 --> 157.51899999999998
anything on

155.36 --> 158.8
almost wish i had some snow goggles or

157.519 --> 161.36
something

158.8 --> 163.519
because yeah the snowflakes literally

161.36 --> 166.16000000000003
like blew in my eyeballs constantly i

163.519 --> 169.519
could feel them

166.16 --> 170.07999999999998
yeah bouncing off my eyeball with very

169.519 --> 173.20000000000002
annoying

170.08 --> 175.20000000000002
like really really difficult it's like

173.2 --> 175.76
somebody's like constantly poking in

175.2 --> 178.319
your eyes

175.76 --> 179.76
very annoying so i wouldn't recommend

178.319 --> 182.319
that

179.76 --> 186.07999999999998
but yeah i worked out anyway i didn't

182.319 --> 188.39999999999998
get into any accidents or anything

186.08 --> 190.08
but yeah very snowy day yesterday now

188.4 --> 198.87900000000002
it's all melted again

190.08 --> 200.56
so it's actually kind of nice and warm

198.879 --> 202.319
don't think you've ever caught the

200.56 --> 206.0
beginning of the show are you

202.319 --> 206.0
serious nathan really

207.599 --> 214.48
so you never just started

210.879 --> 218.79899999999998
you never just play back a show of mine

214.48 --> 221.92
because it's in every intro since

218.799 --> 222.72
since a long time i i don't know where

221.92 --> 226.159
did i get it

222.72 --> 230.56
was it like in show 20 or 50 or

226.159 --> 230.56
something i got it pretty soon so

232.159 --> 236.879
such a disappointed that all the snow

235.439 --> 241.84
melted

236.879 --> 241.84
yeah i guess

241.92 --> 245.28
but who knows maybe there will be that

244.159 --> 248.159
there will be more

245.28 --> 250.159
in a way i'm kind of happy that it's not

248.159 --> 253.12
that cold

250.159 --> 254.159
you know voynich so but it was still

253.12 --> 257.6
very interesting

254.159 --> 261.44
to be in the snowy day yesterday

257.6 --> 264.56
in the middle of january right

261.44 --> 265.68
and yeah got some green tea here by the

264.56 --> 270.24
way it's

265.68 --> 270.24
it's too hot i know it is

274.16 --> 282.32000000000005
yeah yesterday's show was a real blast

277.199 --> 284.08000000000004
with the roger on and

282.32 --> 285.68
yeah that was that was good it was

284.08 --> 290.08
really good to have

285.68 --> 294.84000000000003
somebody back on and then address

290.08 --> 296.24
more specific subjects like that it was

294.84 --> 298.88
good

296.24 --> 300.52
so i'm definitely keeping that option

298.88 --> 302.32
open

300.52 --> 305.039
[Music]

302.32 --> 307.59999999999997
also discussed with roger that maybe in

305.039 --> 310.96
the future we'll do it again

307.6 --> 314.24
and especially concerning netherlands

310.96 --> 317.52
stuff because there is it seems to be

314.24 --> 319.28000000000003
getting to a bubbly point where

317.52 --> 320.79999999999995
there might be a lot of things happening

319.28 --> 323.35999999999996
and of course there's going to be the

320.8 --> 326.88
elections in march

323.36 --> 331.52000000000004
so see if i can keep

326.88 --> 331.52
you guys up to date a little about that

332.32 --> 336.24
and at least keep myself up to date

337.52 --> 340.88
but yeah i was pretty proud of

338.8 --> 344.96000000000004
yesterday's show it was good

340.88 --> 344.96
and now it's just back to me again

348.08 --> 352.32
also ball buster's live yesterday and

350.24 --> 357.28000000000003
that was pretty good

352.32 --> 362.15999999999997
it was was a part of that definitely

357.28 --> 362.15999999999997
but more creation versus

362.319 --> 368.08000000000004
is it evolution whatever that means and

366.08 --> 370.4
the ontological primitives and how that

368.08 --> 374.0
works and was

370.4 --> 374.0
very detailed so

375.199 --> 381.84000000000003
if you haven't seen that it was worth

378.84 --> 381.84
watching

382.639 --> 386.319
the world will be a different place

386.8 --> 391.68
aren't you being a little bit dramatic

388.96 --> 391.68
there voynich

393.44 --> 409.84
like what will be so different about it

421.36 --> 424.08000000000004
voynich

424.42 --> 430.319
[Music]

426.56 --> 430.319
just throwing that out there in chat

430.96 --> 437.84
you should be expecting me to respond

432.96 --> 437.84
then i respond to the chat after all

441.039 --> 453.44
can i have your input that

451.199 --> 456.24
okay there will be many changes soon

453.44 --> 456.24
yeah like what

456.4 --> 468.0
what are you afraid of

464.72 --> 470.16
elections and overthrown governments

468.0 --> 473.28
okay hey by the way good morning robin

470.16 --> 473.28000000000003
stanley good to see you

476.96 --> 493.84
and bombing and chisel right well

480.479 --> 493.84
maybe maybe

494.319 --> 497.599
it all depends in my opinion like what's

496.879 --> 501.44
gonna happen

497.599 --> 505.12
in yeah around the us

501.44 --> 505.12
inauguration time and all that

505.28 --> 509.52
and then we'll see because i just have

508.319 --> 511.91900000000004
the feeling that there's

509.52 --> 513.5989999999999
like this game being played out and

511.919 --> 516.8
we're all

513.599 --> 518.9590000000001
meant to look like fools in the face of

516.8 --> 518.959
it

519.76 --> 523.599
so i think that who knows

524.399 --> 532.8
but yeah it's likely with the us

529.12 --> 534.9590000000001
government that at some point either way

532.8 --> 538.56
they are going to redirect their

534.959 --> 541.92
attention back on other countries and

538.56 --> 545.1999999999999
yeah who knows iran north korea

541.92 --> 548.24
china whatever something

545.2 --> 550.48
will eventually start pulling away the

548.24 --> 551.6800000000001
attention just from the us what's going

550.48 --> 555.12
on there

551.68 --> 557.1999999999999
back to that sort of thing so

555.12 --> 560.64
don't know when that's gonna happen you

557.2 --> 560.6400000000001
say it's gonna happen in march

561.44 --> 565.9200000000001
or weren't you thinking that specific

569.04 --> 576.56
they are pulling all trig well yeah

572.16 --> 579.12
well that's yeah

576.56 --> 580.64
them pulling all tricks does not

579.12 --> 583.44
necessarily

580.64 --> 585.04
mean in a direct sense that that means

583.44 --> 586.6400000000001
that all the [ __ ] is going to hit the

585.04 --> 590.7199999999999
fan it just means they up

586.64 --> 590.72
the level of pressure in my opinion

591.92 --> 598.4799999999999
you sent you money oh okay

595.12 --> 602.32
thanks nathan check it out

598.48 --> 604.0
intro was made or the music at least and

602.32 --> 608.0790000000001
yeah i made it on the music

604.0 --> 611.44
i made the little video of the intro

608.079 --> 615.1999999999999
it was the music was made by chris berry

611.44 --> 619.839
so you can thank him for that oh

615.2 --> 619.839
i thank you nathan that's very nice

619.92 --> 624.24
not 6066 this time

625.04 --> 633.8389999999999
i thank you

634.8 --> 637.76
like last time

639.2 --> 642.48
yeah but i appreciate that and i can't

640.959 --> 646.3199999999999
use it because like

642.48 --> 646.9590000000001
well i got about is it 18 euros left on

646.32 --> 649.0400000000001
my account

646.959 --> 651.3599999999999
i have to somehow sit use that for the

649.04 --> 651.36
next

652.24 --> 659.12
week maybe so yeah i could definitely

655.839 --> 661.839
use the support so it's

659.12 --> 661.839
very helpful

663.12 --> 666.48
my verbal intro after the video very

665.92 --> 668.5699999999999
professional

666.48 --> 670.48
that's just systematic i'm it

668.57 --> 673.12
[Music]

670.48 --> 673.839
i'm being like a tape recorder basically

673.12 --> 676.16
like it

673.839 --> 678.32
and i copied it a bit from you now you

676.16 --> 680.56
you've been much more dynamic and much

678.32 --> 680.5600000000001
more

680.72 --> 684.24
i don't know it's kind of your thing

686.8 --> 690.959
for me it's the first time i'm even

688.8 --> 694.16
doing something like that something that

690.959 --> 696.3199999999999
repetitious i'm not i'm

694.16 --> 697.279
not used to doing that at all but i had

696.32 --> 701.2
to do something

697.279 --> 702.64
and this is what i made it into

701.2 --> 704.9590000000001
but thank you thank you for the

702.64 --> 707.36
compliment

704.959 --> 709.3599999999999
today's startup went very well i do make

707.36 --> 712.399
i do stumble a lot though or

709.36 --> 712.72
like my voice like does something weird

712.399 --> 716.0
or

712.72 --> 718.399
just can't pronounce it correctly

716.0 --> 720.639
sound it sounds a little bit mumbled but

718.399 --> 722.56
yeah

720.639 --> 724.72
it's the first thing i'm saying in the

722.56 --> 727.92
day like literally i don't

724.72 --> 729.44
have conversations before i start up the

727.92 --> 732.4799999999999
show in a day

729.44 --> 733.0400000000001
right literally i don't there's nobody

732.48 --> 736.5600000000001
here

733.04 --> 737.4399999999999
i wake up i kind of do stuff i watch

736.56 --> 739.92
someone listen

737.44 --> 741.44
but the first there's nobody i speak to

739.92 --> 743.279
in the morning typically

741.44 --> 746.399
unlike you probably because you probably

743.279 --> 748.88
wake up next to your wife

746.399 --> 750.639
so you start talking before you start

748.88 --> 754.0
the show

750.639 --> 756.9590000000001
i don't get that practice every morning

754.0 --> 758.079
so it's always i do basically just do

756.959 --> 761.5189999999999
like uh uh

758.079 --> 761.519
just to see what it sounds like

764.399 --> 768.959
before the show not on the show that

766.24 --> 768.9590000000001
would be silly

769.6 --> 775.12
did i miss the weather robin sandy

776.639 --> 779.04
did you

780.079 --> 786.16
i did my weather report yes

784.24 --> 787.839
but i also started up very late by the

786.16 --> 790.399
way i just i needed

787.839 --> 790.399
the time

791.2 --> 794.639
and i was watching a video that i was

793.04 --> 796.399
very captivated about and i couldn't

794.639 --> 797.6
stop watching i had to see it all

796.399 --> 799.839
through

797.6 --> 800.9590000000001
somebody a metal worker on a very

799.839 --> 804.1600000000001
professional level

800.959 --> 804.16
reconstructing a

804.32 --> 811.519
brilliant piece of equipment from

807.68 --> 814.959
the 19th century

811.519 --> 819.279
like a screwdriver very mechanical

814.959 --> 821.92
it was just fascinating the whole way

819.279 --> 821.92
to see that

823.199 --> 830.639
and i just yeah i met out a bit about it

826.56 --> 830.6389999999999
just had to watch it through

830.88 --> 835.199
but yeah the weather today over here is

833.519 --> 836.9590000000001
kind of nice and sunny and warm in

835.199 --> 839.199
contrast to yesterday

836.959 --> 841.4399999999999
when it was starting to snow at the end

839.199 --> 842.56
of my show and that kept on going pretty

841.44 --> 846.72
much

842.56 --> 849.1199999999999
until the night and it was a

846.72 --> 851.6
yeah big layer of snow literally

849.12 --> 851.6
everywhere

852.56 --> 856.8
i was hoping it would keep laying around

854.959 --> 859.92
so i would be able to film it on my show

856.8 --> 859.92
today but it didn't

862.72 --> 865.279
oh well

868.839 --> 875.44
hmm

871.199 --> 875.4399999999999
when it's like this it's not surprising

877.519 --> 888.24
that snow is gonna melt

884.959 --> 890.7199999999999
i even took or uh one half hour ago

888.24 --> 892.639
there was even still a little bit snow

890.72 --> 895.76
left here and there but it's now it's

892.639 --> 896.32
really all gone i guess the sun is

895.76 --> 899.8389999999999
really

896.32 --> 899.839
warming things up

901.199 --> 907.3599999999999
a [ __ ] russell blue marble science

909.279 --> 916.639
oh god

912.72 --> 917.9200000000001
oh god what is it with ballers thinking

916.639 --> 921.44
that

917.92 --> 923.12
people are afraid of them come on blue

921.44 --> 927.839
marvel science you really think nathan's

923.12 --> 927.839
afraid of you

933.839 --> 939.2790000000001
it's good to to basically create some

936.959 --> 941.1199999999999
confidence for yourself but

939.279 --> 942.72
it doesn't actually work when you then

941.12 --> 945.6
project that

942.72 --> 949.12
onto other people they're still gonna

945.6 --> 949.12
see you for what you are so

950.88 --> 956.88
it's just silly anyway welcome

954.16 --> 956.88
to my chat

957.759 --> 969.839
and zach i see

979.26 --> 983.8389999999999
[Music]

980.839 --> 983.839
hmm

992.78 --> 995.8399999999999
[Music]

1008.839 --> 1011.839
yep

1022.839 --> 1027.6000000000001
one

1025.199 --> 1030.48
oh by the way i'll post that screwdriver

1027.6 --> 1030.48
video also

1032.72 --> 1038.559
in the early birth chat

1036.559 --> 1039.839
for those in there that want to want to

1038.559 --> 1043.36
see

1039.839 --> 1043.36
what kept me from doing the show

1048.559 --> 1052.799
and by the way yeah i looked at the

1050.88 --> 1056.0800000000002
channel of

1052.799 --> 1058.4
yeah of that video also does a lot of

1056.08 --> 1061.039
these very old equipment things that are

1058.4 --> 1062.799
all rusted up and all that

1061.039 --> 1064.8799999999999
and then basically remake them and he

1062.799 --> 1068.48
also welds

1064.88 --> 1072.88
rusted pieces like adds stuff on just

1068.48 --> 1076.96
really remix them from scratch using the

1072.88 --> 1076.96
original it's pretty impressive where

1078.96 --> 1084.08
and i like to see like how he really

1081.76 --> 1086.559
restores the functionality of that very

1084.08 --> 1087.6
old-fashioned equipment very mechanical

1086.559 --> 1090.6399999999999
natured

1087.6 --> 1109.12
non-electronic and

1090.64 --> 1112.24
non-plastic it's very fascinating

1109.12 --> 1114.559
oh i'm oh thank you

1112.24 --> 1115.36
blue marble science i'm so honored that

1114.559 --> 1117.84
i am

1115.36 --> 1119.6
welcome to join any of your live streams

1117.84 --> 1123.84
that's

1119.6 --> 1123.84
that's very nice

1126.48 --> 1130.4
i yeah i don't know what i'd be doing

1128.64 --> 1132.0800000000002
there though

1130.4 --> 1135.3600000000001
i don't even what are your live streams

1132.08 --> 1138.48
about is it just ballers talking or

1135.36 --> 1138.4799999999998
you present things

1146.64 --> 1150.0800000000002
because you know i i will not be able to

1149.2 --> 1153.8400000000001
help myself

1150.08 --> 1155.84
from yeah forcing things down to the

1153.84 --> 1157.12
really is level from point to point so

1155.84 --> 1161.12
that is going to happen

1157.12 --> 1165.84
if i were to consider appearing on some

1161.12 --> 1165.84
baller show

1169.2 --> 1174.4
you could also of course consider to

1171.039 --> 1179.84
just get back on nathan's show

1174.4 --> 1179.8400000000001
why don't you why did you try it again

1180.24 --> 1193.84
you can just test how far you've gotten

1184.0 --> 1193.84
how much you've learned of what happens

1207.2 --> 1214.24
simple phone issues yesterday

1210.799 --> 1221.84
public not empathetic what

1214.24 --> 1221.84
i don't understand robin stanley

1221.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
oh god

1241.039 --> 1247.2
look guys this is like i

1244.4 --> 1247.2
i don't really

1247.6 --> 1250.799
don't you really want to be talking

1249.52 --> 1253.679
about

1250.799 --> 1254.6399999999999
ballers sucking balls and all that you

1253.679 --> 1257.679
know in the heat

1254.64 --> 1259.679
of the moment when it's

1257.679 --> 1261.2800000000002
going at the flat earth debates it's

1259.679 --> 1263.3600000000001
really funny

1261.28 --> 1264.96
it's a good metaphor and it's funny how

1263.36 --> 1268.1589999999999
that works but

1264.96 --> 1268.159
if that's not the case

1268.799 --> 1272.24
it's kind of ill

1272.64 --> 1278.48
although yeah ballers in my presence

1276.799 --> 1280.8799999999999
usually make me so yeah

1278.48 --> 1282.64
take that back as they will eventually

1280.88 --> 1286.7990000000002
just start doing it

1282.64 --> 1286.7990000000002
i can't help themselves i agree

1288.84 --> 1292.9599999999998
huh

1290.32 --> 1292.96
okay zach

1297.2 --> 1301.2
i didn't know you've been following good

1298.88 --> 1304.0800000000002
servant

1301.2 --> 1306.64
is it like on a new channel or or the

1304.08 --> 1306.6399999999999
old channel

1316.0 --> 1320.159
go live with cavendish

1322.88 --> 1325.2
what

1328.48 --> 1332.88
oh oh nathan nathan he didn't say

1331.44 --> 1336.4
experiment

1332.88 --> 1336.4
he just said cavendish

1343.039 --> 1346.64
sounds really funny like that blue

1344.799 --> 1351.2
marvel science i only go

1346.64 --> 1351.2
live with cavendish yay

1351.679 --> 1355.6000000000001
cavendish who was presupposing gravity

1354.559 --> 1360.1589999999999
and

1355.6 --> 1374.32
weighing the earth how special through

1360.159 --> 1377.919
math by the way

1374.32 --> 1379.9189999999999
right pure science

1377.919 --> 1381.76
it's not exactly pure science though

1379.919 --> 1384.0
it's more like

1381.76 --> 1385.36
relics from the past that have been

1384.0 --> 1388.32
involved in

1385.36 --> 1390.7199999999998
scientific debates or debates concerning

1388.32 --> 1390.72
science

1391.44 --> 1396.559
so it's more like science history well

1394.4 --> 1399.2800000000002
it's tough even calling it history

1396.559 --> 1401.44
because is it is it much well it used to

1399.28 --> 1402.8799999999999
be science now it's not so much science

1401.44 --> 1406.4
anymore because it became

1402.88 --> 1407.6000000000001
very messy crazy little philosophical

1406.4 --> 1411.76
assumptions that

1407.6 --> 1411.76
science means anything instead of that

1414.84 --> 1417.84
method

1418.32 --> 1431.23
yeah exactly what nathan says there

1421.919 --> 1434.5890000000002
all right zach

1431.23 --> 1434.589
[Music]

1437.38 --> 1440.5490000000002
[Music]

1468.72 --> 1472.48
right well you know the whole funny

1470.88 --> 1476.88
thing about it is even you know

1472.48 --> 1480.48
mass attracts mass is that the idea

1476.88 --> 1481.919
is not even that because i think there

1480.48 --> 1486.159
is like on the very

1481.919 --> 1489.44
very short short distance

1486.159 --> 1491.44
there is an effect that you could say

1489.44 --> 1492.72
okay mass may be sort of attracted by

1491.44 --> 1494.799
mass because there is

1492.72 --> 1498.159
like this attract what do you call it

1494.799 --> 1500.96
has to do with cohesion and all that

1498.159 --> 1502.88
material does clog together but it's on

1500.96 --> 1504.159
a very short distance the funny thing

1502.88 --> 1507.279
though is about

1504.159 --> 1510.159
the whole idea of mass attracting mass

1507.279 --> 1512.0
is it not that it's actually attracting

1510.159 --> 1515.1200000000001
but that it attracts over a

1512.0 --> 1516.88
distance and that a preponderance of a

1515.12 --> 1520.7199999999998
mass

1516.88 --> 1521.279
attracts other mass over a fast distance

1520.72 --> 1525.52
that's

1521.279 --> 1527.6
really the part where it gets weird

1525.52 --> 1528.559
because there's no evidence of what of

1527.6 --> 1531.6
that

1528.559 --> 1534.72
in the slightest but matter

1531.6 --> 1536.48
very close to other matter yeah it might

1534.72 --> 1538.799
attract it

1536.48 --> 1541.279
who knows why through electrostatics

1538.799 --> 1541.279
through just

1541.52 --> 1546.4
things like surface tension related

1544.08 --> 1549.52
forces very close

1546.4 --> 1553.8400000000001
proximity type forces that do make

1549.52 --> 1555.679
matter move towards other matter see

1553.84 --> 1557.36
that does exist it's just that it's that

1555.679 --> 1560.799
very close distance and

1557.36 --> 1563.84
the idea of gravity mass attracting mass

1560.799 --> 1565.84
is that it it's supposed to attract over

1563.84 --> 1571.84
a fast distance

1565.84 --> 1571.84
that's really where the fiction comes in

1573.44 --> 1578.64
because it has to do that in order for

1576.559 --> 1582.08
the astronomical bodies to be

1578.64 --> 1586.24
presupposed as bodies of mass

1582.08 --> 1588.96
that are influenced by one another

1586.24 --> 1592.0
over a vast distance that is the idea

1588.96 --> 1595.3600000000001
that's the idea that they

1592.0 --> 1599.039
had to invent that mass attracting mass

1595.36 --> 1601.279
over a distance gravity for

1599.039 --> 1602.4
see because maybe you just should call

1601.279 --> 1604.4
it that not just

1602.4 --> 1605.52
mass attracting mass but it's mass

1604.4 --> 1609.44
attracting mass

1605.52 --> 1613.84
over a distance that's the real

1609.44 --> 1613.8400000000001
supposed newtonian gravity

1614.0 --> 1627.84
you see

1633.2 --> 1642.3990000000001
distance is the cause oh god

1640.399 --> 1644.32
now i wasn't claiming that distance is

1642.399 --> 1645.6789999999999
the cause of gravity i'm just saying

1644.32 --> 1648.48
that

1645.679 --> 1650.799
it the idea of that mass attracting mass

1648.48 --> 1651.679
distance is that it attracts it even at

1650.799 --> 1654.0
a distance

1651.679 --> 1655.1200000000001
that there is an influence at a vast

1654.0 --> 1657.679
distance

1655.12 --> 1659.76
there is no evidence of that so the

1657.679 --> 1664.0
distance is not

1659.76 --> 1667.44
the cause or even the phenomenon

1664.0 --> 1669.36
the attraction would be yeah

1667.44 --> 1671.2
it doesn't happen it doesn't attract

1669.36 --> 1673.6789999999999
mass doesn't attract other masses over

1671.2 --> 1673.679
distance

1675.12 --> 1680.84
all these types of attractive forces all

1678.32 --> 1685.12
have limited ranges one way or the other

1680.84 --> 1688.48
electrostatics magnetics all have

1685.12 --> 1691.1999999999998
yeah they have measurable things but

1688.48 --> 1692.0
those things decrease over distance

1691.2 --> 1695.3600000000001
that's just

1692.0 --> 1697.76
how the real forces work so

1695.36 --> 1700.6399999999999
mass doesn't passively attract other

1697.76 --> 1703.76
mass over a fast distance

1700.64 --> 1703.76
like cavendish

1704.0 --> 1711.84
unclaimed newtonian gravity suggests

1712.159 --> 1719.279
right and that's still just assuming

1715.6 --> 1722.6399999999999
that newtonian gravity is a thing but

1719.279 --> 1725.44
i'm basically laying out why it's not

1722.64 --> 1726.0800000000002
and also getting in the skin of what

1725.44 --> 1729.6000000000001
it's

1726.08 --> 1732.32
what it actually represents the idea

1729.6 --> 1735.12
of mass attracting another mass over a

1732.32 --> 1735.12
vast distance

1736.72 --> 1741.279
because why where did that come from

1739.36 --> 1742.6399999999999
where did that necessity come from why

1741.279 --> 1745.279
did they conjure that up

1742.64 --> 1747.1200000000001
well because they want to explain the

1745.279 --> 1751.039
astronomical bodies to be

1747.12 --> 1753.76
giant masses having an influence

1751.039 --> 1755.52
on one another over those astronomical

1753.76 --> 1759.52
distances see

1755.52 --> 1759.52
that's why they conjure that up

1761.6 --> 1764.8799999999999
and then of course einstein as you say

1764.08 --> 1767.84
nathan

1764.88 --> 1767.8400000000001
came in

1767.919 --> 1772.0
and just completely erected by saying no

1770.799 --> 1774.32
no it no

1772.0 --> 1776.559
gravity is something else now it's not

1774.32 --> 1778.559
this conjuration of

1776.559 --> 1780.0
mass attracting mass over distance no

1778.559 --> 1782.08
it's bending of space time

1780.0 --> 1783.279
and nobody knows what that is but here's

1782.08 --> 1787.84
all the analogies

1783.279 --> 1792.48
of of dimensional warping basically

1787.84 --> 1792.48
and it doesn't mean anything it's just

1792.559 --> 1798.72
surreal math that's it it's [ __ ]

1795.76 --> 1809.84
einstein gravity is just surreal math

1798.72 --> 1813.1200000000001
that's it

1809.84 --> 1815.36
ah but this is good to see yeah

1813.12 --> 1817.76
do marble science trying to respond to

1815.36 --> 1817.76
nathan

1821.2 --> 1828.0
i almost wish you two could hear you

1824.88 --> 1828.0
instead of just read you

1835.52 --> 1840.1589999999999
oh einstein said that himself

1848.84 --> 1851.84
what

1853.84 --> 1858.0
it's getting a little incohesive there

1856.24 --> 1861.84
blue marvel signs

1858.0 --> 1863.87
can you be more specific about what

1861.84 --> 1865.1999999999998
what einstein said himself

1863.87 --> 1867.84
[Music]

1865.2 --> 1870.24
read the dumb book yeah well how do we

1867.84 --> 1872.0
know what to look for

1870.24 --> 1874.24
to see if you're right if you're not

1872.0 --> 1875.919
even saying what einstein did not say

1874.24 --> 1877.6
himself

1875.919 --> 1878.96
because nathan is talking about a lot of

1877.6 --> 1881.23
different things here you got to get

1878.96 --> 1884.44
more specific

1881.23 --> 1884.44
[Music]

1885.84 --> 1889.9189999999999
well marble science look you're here

1887.919 --> 1890.72
right now you don't have to listen to

1889.919 --> 1892.7990000000002
nathan

1890.72 --> 1894.72
verbally whipping you you should be

1892.799 --> 1895.519
happy because that's gonna happen anyway

1894.72 --> 1897.3600000000001
if you would

1895.519 --> 1899.84
actually go into debate you're here in

1897.36 --> 1903.76
my chat it's a pretty neutral platform

1899.84 --> 1906.8799999999999
i accept ballers i do as long as they

1903.76 --> 1909.84
behave not get trollish so

1906.88 --> 1911.1200000000001
nathan's here let's let's just keep

1909.84 --> 1914.399
going

1911.12 --> 1917.4399999999998
and i would definitely recommend that

1914.399 --> 1920.559
yeah you would actually read nathan's

1917.44 --> 1923.919
lines because he is addressing a lot

1920.559 --> 1926.399
concerning the things that are discussed

1923.919 --> 1929.44
between you

1926.399 --> 1935.84
between you and me and nathan getting

1929.44 --> 1935.8400000000001
involved so

1937.2 --> 1941.2
einstein said that neither his nor any

1940.399 --> 1944.9599999999998
other

1941.2 --> 1948.48
theory would ever replace

1944.96 --> 1951.1200000000001
the great work of newton what newton

1948.48 --> 1953.44
didn't claim a hypothesis

1951.12 --> 1954.1589999999999
so that's a paradoxical statement and

1953.44 --> 1957.679
also

1954.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
did he actually say that

1957.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
can anybody else confirm that

1988.84 --> 1991.84
that

2002.84 --> 2005.84
so

2014.24 --> 2018.0
yeah yeah what was russell said i tried

2017.6 --> 2019.4399999999998
to say

2018.0 --> 2021.519
too like nutha never claimed the

2019.44 --> 2024.0800000000002
hypothesis so

2021.519 --> 2026.3990000000001
einstein might have praised newton's

2024.08 --> 2026.399
work

2026.799 --> 2030.24
newton never did you say nathan never

2028.72 --> 2032.159
claimed the hypoth

2030.24 --> 2034.559
newton never claimed hypothesis so even

2032.159 --> 2037.279
if einstein praised his work

2034.559 --> 2038.72
and hey i kind of still do it i think it

2037.279 --> 2040.799
i liked it

2038.72 --> 2044.159
but there's mistakes and hey he never

2040.799 --> 2044.1589999999999
claimed the hypothesis so

2044.559 --> 2049.839
how can any theory replace because

2047.76 --> 2051.919
when you say replace that already

2049.839 --> 2055.04
verbally suggests

2051.919 --> 2055.7599999999998
that there is something there on the

2055.04 --> 2058.32
same level

2055.76 --> 2060.0
if a theory replaced that then you're

2058.32 --> 2061.76
basically implying that there was a

2060.0 --> 2064.8
theory to begin with but

2061.76 --> 2068.32
newton never claimed the hypothesis

2064.8 --> 2070.0
so you're being slightly misleading

2068.32 --> 2075.839
there

2070.0 --> 2075.839
surprise surprise

2077.57 --> 2080.739
[Music]

2084.639 --> 2089.839
where did he go he's still here

2112.48 --> 2116.8
it's okay tony that's all right yeah

2114.72 --> 2119.2
newton is still being taught in school i

2116.8 --> 2121.8390000000004
was taught newton in school

2119.2 --> 2125.4399999999996
but then immediately after that was over

2121.839 --> 2129.04
we were also confronted with like yeah

2125.44 --> 2132.48
but we don't actually use this anymore

2129.04 --> 2135.359
because of einstein's work but then

2132.48 --> 2137.44
it was kind of discontinued in physics

2135.359 --> 2139.7599999999998
class

2137.44 --> 2140.8
and then basically said like okay yeah

2139.76 --> 2143.8390000000004
that's

2140.8 --> 2145.04
higher education we're not going to

2143.839 --> 2149.68
teach you about

2145.04 --> 2151.92
about einstein and then some points

2149.68 --> 2153.9199999999996
i asked my brother because he actually

2151.92 --> 2156.7200000000003
went to a university where he did get

2153.92 --> 2156.7200000000003
taught all that

2157.599 --> 2161.3590000000004
or was it like he had another program

2159.92 --> 2164.2400000000002
where he they did get

2161.359 --> 2166.0789999999997
treat einstein i'm not sure but he knew

2164.24 --> 2168.0789999999997
a lot more about it

2166.079 --> 2169.3590000000004
and he when i was very young tried to

2168.079 --> 2173.6800000000003
explain some of it but

2169.359 --> 2176.56
it was just i was

2173.68 --> 2177.52
still dreaming that math is reality in

2176.56 --> 2179.7599999999998
ways too so

2177.52 --> 2181.68
it was also very confusing and i

2179.76 --> 2183.599
constantly oh but what about black holes

2181.68 --> 2186.7999999999997
what about black hole that sort of thing

2183.599 --> 2188.7200000000003
you know i wanted to know

2186.8 --> 2192.1600000000003
where the math was leading us because i

2188.72 --> 2192.16
thought it was reality back then

2195.76 --> 2201.8390000000004
i muted blue no no

2205.52 --> 2209.92
oh my god it's just

2212.72 --> 2217.5989999999997
mass attracting mass is the independent

2216.079 --> 2222.6400000000003
variable

2217.599 --> 2226.2400000000002
what so how are you going to

2222.64 --> 2229.2799999999997
very manipulate the ability

2226.24 --> 2232.0
of mass attracting other mass

2229.28 --> 2234.0
so you're going to stop it from

2232.0 --> 2235.92
attracting other mass

2234.0 --> 2238.8
actively because you know what causes

2235.92 --> 2238.8
that and then

2239.52 --> 2246.079
enhance that attraction

2243.28 --> 2246.079
that what

2247.76 --> 2252.88
how you're gonna very manipulate the

2250.079 --> 2252.88
attraction

2255.04 --> 2259.119
i think you misunderstand because i

2256.64 --> 2262.0
don't think you can

2259.119 --> 2262.96
not so you don't you don't think you can

2262.0 --> 2264.4
because it's just

2262.96 --> 2267.44
tied in with the amount of mass

2264.4 --> 2271.359
supposedly right well then you're not

2267.44 --> 2273.599
very manipulating the attraction

2271.359 --> 2276.3199999999997
which is the phenomena that you bring

2273.599 --> 2276.32
forth here

2276.4 --> 2285.839
equations oh god

2286.079 --> 2289.92
no dutch sailor and don't

2290.16 --> 2292.56
don't

2298.32 --> 2300.8
sunday

2301.68 --> 2304.7999999999997
and i don't want anybody to bring that

2303.44 --> 2313.839
up anyway it's

2304.8 --> 2313.8390000000004
not funny

2322.48 --> 2325.599
right yeah nathan oakley the funny thing

2324.64 --> 2327.7599999999998
about that is

2325.599 --> 2329.2000000000003
you put it down correct that is kind of

2327.76 --> 2331.44
what they're

2329.2 --> 2332.3199999999997
what ballers typically do with supposed

2331.44 --> 2335.359
gravity

2332.32 --> 2338.0
but let's just replace it for a second

2335.359 --> 2339.04
as an example with something that is

2338.0 --> 2342.8
proven as a

2339.04 --> 2347.7599999999998
as a force effect magnetism so

2342.8 --> 2350.079
how could you prove magnetism attracts

2347.76 --> 2352.6400000000003
magnetically viable bodies over a

2350.079 --> 2355.44
distance through science

2352.64 --> 2359.359
through the scientific method like

2355.44 --> 2362.4
that's not a violent hypothesis either

2359.359 --> 2366.48
and that is with something that we know

2362.4 --> 2368.7200000000003
and can prove attracts

2366.48 --> 2369.839
you know so that is with a proven force

2368.72 --> 2373.359
and even if you

2369.839 --> 2376.32
are applying a proven force

2373.359 --> 2377.119
in a setup and then claiming it as an

2376.32 --> 2380.4
experiment

2377.119 --> 2383.76
like in that fashion it doesn't work

2380.4 --> 2388.0
and that's with something that is proven

2383.76 --> 2391.2000000000003
so the entire premise their approach

2388.0 --> 2394.32
just is completely nonsensical garbage

2391.2 --> 2397.4399999999996
it's it's male formed

2394.32 --> 2399.3590000000004
like even if you would replace it the

2397.44 --> 2402.64
hypothesis attempt

2399.359 --> 2404.48
with a proven force thing

2402.64 --> 2406.24
it's still not gonna work if you present

2404.48 --> 2411.839
it like that it's just

2406.24 --> 2411.839
it's completely malformed

2411.93 --> 2415.73
[Music]

2416.16 --> 2428.949
okay so now let's see your chat

2425.79 --> 2428.949
[Music]

2429.44 --> 2433.359
yeah don't worry about dutch sailor it's

2436.839 --> 2439.839
just

2450.839 --> 2453.839
anyway

2462.0 --> 2469.52
the measure the force

2465.599 --> 2471.839
of attraction between two masses

2469.52 --> 2471.839
what

2473.2 --> 2480.0
really so how are you measuring

2477.28 --> 2480.6400000000003
the force of attraction between two

2480.0 --> 2486.0
masses

2480.64 --> 2486.0
blue marble signs this is just overboard

2486.48 --> 2489.92
look i know you meant calculating and

2489.44 --> 2492.48
you

2489.92 --> 2494.4
reify calculating into measuring because

2492.48 --> 2495.92
you do that all the time because math is

2494.4 --> 2499.28
reality

2495.92 --> 2499.92
but to actually just blatantly say that

2499.28 --> 2503.76
you are

2499.92 --> 2508.2400000000002
measuring the force of attraction then

2503.76 --> 2511.6800000000003
come on that's really stupid that's a

2508.24 --> 2511.68
really dumb thing to say

2512.72 --> 2517.359
how could you measure that can only

2515.92 --> 2523.839
calculate that

2517.359 --> 2523.839
everybody knows that

2525.119 --> 2537.839
if it was actually there by the way

2543.68 --> 2546.319
oh wow

2548.0 --> 2551.92
oh we got the attention of some more

2549.76 --> 2555.3590000000004
ballers that think they're smart by

2551.92 --> 2555.359
inserting more garbage

2558.079 --> 2565.44
that's you're not helping

2561.359 --> 2568.72
you know every time that happens

2565.44 --> 2571.839
it just makes ballers look more [ __ ]

2568.72 --> 2573.9199999999996
it really does like if

2571.839 --> 2575.7599999999998
garbage is all you got to bring then

2573.92 --> 2577.6800000000003
maybe you should just shut up

2575.76 --> 2578.96
because you're literally ruining it for

2577.68 --> 2582.72
your own

2578.96 --> 2585.359
representation of your side your belief

2582.72 --> 2593.839
making it look really ugly i don't know

2585.359 --> 2593.839
why you guys all insist on doing that

2594.34 --> 2597.469
[Music]

2597.599 --> 2602.56
but anyway let's continue this is very

2599.52 --> 2602.56
interesting in chat

2603.28 --> 2606.96
torsion balance premise cavendish expand

2605.52 --> 2610.48
measure the same way coulomb

2606.96 --> 2610.48
measured what

2613.76 --> 2621.44
how because electrostatic force yeah

2618.079 --> 2623.76
i guess that could be the the electro

2621.44 --> 2624.64
the electrics could be measured the

2623.76 --> 2627.2000000000003
force

2624.64 --> 2629.44
not so much because force usually can

2627.2 --> 2631.839
only be calculated

2629.44 --> 2632.48
with weight which is kind of calculated

2631.839 --> 2635.839
a

2632.48 --> 2638.48
calculate a calculatory derivative

2635.839 --> 2640.96
that's weight it's pressure and then

2638.48 --> 2644.96
translating it calculating it

2640.96 --> 2648.16
right but how would you do that

2644.96 --> 2650.319
with unmeasurable gravity

2648.16 --> 2652.3999999999996
gravity that cannot mass attracting mass

2650.319 --> 2655.2799999999997
gravity that can only be calculated it's

2652.4 --> 2655.28
so stupid

2656.16 --> 2662.48
how it's

2659.599 --> 2664.8
just asking you it's so simple it's so

2662.48 --> 2667.28
simple yet you keep malforming

2664.8 --> 2669.52
the entire thing blue marble science

2667.28 --> 2672.079
yeah while you are trying to

2669.52 --> 2673.839
gaslight us into making us uh feel

2672.079 --> 2676.88
stupid about ourselves for not

2673.839 --> 2679.2
knowing the basic [ __ ] that we or most

2676.88 --> 2682.8
of us go through in school

2679.2 --> 2684.0
you're being tested on actual scientific

2682.8 --> 2685.8390000000004
knowledge

2684.0 --> 2687.839
if you understand the scientific method

2685.839 --> 2690.56
what it is

2687.839 --> 2692.7999999999997
right and we're testing you keep on

2690.56 --> 2696.48
ignoring it but

2692.8 --> 2696.48
you're the one being tested here

2697.359 --> 2700.64
you're gaslighting that oh we don't even

2700.079 --> 2702.8
know

2700.64 --> 2704.16
the basic conditioning nonsense that we

2702.8 --> 2706.1600000000003
go through in school and the

2704.16 --> 2710.64
misassumptions that you typically

2706.16 --> 2710.64
get from that yeah we're not falling for

2716.839 --> 2719.839
that

2744.839 --> 2747.839
so

2748.24 --> 2753.52
high school science fair that teaches

2750.8 --> 2756.96
the scientific method that's cool

2753.52 --> 2756.96
i've never been to one of those

2757.839 --> 2761.599
yes i know blue marble signs the torsion

2760.96 --> 2764.88
balance

2761.599 --> 2767.92
i know i've seen one

2764.88 --> 2770.6400000000003
yeah i know you know what though it is

2767.92 --> 2775.359
just a device

2770.64 --> 2778.56
and you're conjuring up something in it

2775.359 --> 2781.359
because you can't actually measure it

2778.56 --> 2789.839
you're just assuming it's there it's

2781.359 --> 2789.839
it's ridiculous

2797.01 --> 2800.139
[Music]

2805.92 --> 2817.839
what uh

2818.72 --> 2822.8799999999997
no no tony that

2826.319 --> 2845.839
unfortunately that doesn't make any

2828.24 --> 2845.839
sense and it's ad homing by the way

2856.839 --> 2859.839
so

2861.359 --> 2866.72
i don't know what pills you take tony v

2864.64 --> 2869.2
but since you even bring it up i i take

2866.72 --> 2871.52
it you have a habit

2869.2 --> 2872.7999999999997
of taking pharmaceuticals you probably

2871.52 --> 2875.68
have some

2872.8 --> 2878.48
just for the case right or did you know

2875.68 --> 2880.48
that even taking some of that sometimes

2878.48 --> 2881.839
for whatever reason some kind of

2880.48 --> 2885.2
alteration

2881.839 --> 2886.72
is a dramatic influence

2885.2 --> 2888.24
on the long run especially if you

2886.72 --> 2889.7599999999998
combine certain things so

2888.24 --> 2892.0789999999997
you might want to be careful with those

2889.76 --> 2894.48
pharmaceuticals

2892.079 --> 2895.599
that i assume you probably take every

2894.48 --> 2899.52
now and then

2895.599 --> 2903.52
i've never taken any of it even in pain

2899.52 --> 2903.52
yeah because i know it's serious

2912.0 --> 2916.88
am i oh now i'm getting compliments okie

2915.2 --> 2921.04
dokie

2916.88 --> 2921.76
sure well look we all have our own

2921.04 --> 2924.8
talents

2921.76 --> 2928.079
and our own pitfalls and

2924.8 --> 2929.6800000000003
nathan is pretty damn smart and he knows

2928.079 --> 2933.119
what he's talking about he's just

2929.68 --> 2936.0789999999997
being a bit pushy about it because

2933.119 --> 2936.079
we all like that

2936.96 --> 2940.16
because he's willing to do that he's

2938.96 --> 2944.48
willing to just

2940.16 --> 2947.2799999999997
really ram it down your throats and

2944.48 --> 2948.079
yeah that tenacity we appreciate i

2947.28 --> 2953.28
appreciate that

2948.079 --> 2955.2000000000003
nathan he knows that it's his thing

2953.28 --> 2956.96
so nathan's pretty damn smart he knows

2955.2 --> 2957.359
what he's talking about he doesn't like

2956.96 --> 2962.0
to be

2957.359 --> 2964.88
wrong you know it's he's not gonna bluff

2962.0 --> 2967.119
what he does with this sort of thing he

2964.88 --> 2968.7200000000003
goes by what he's learned and it would

2967.119 --> 2970.96
be wise for

2968.72 --> 2972.7999999999997
others to start listening to what he's

2970.96 --> 2975.52
saying

2972.8 --> 2976.7200000000003
because then you might stop it from

2975.52 --> 2979.04
continuing you might

2976.72 --> 2980.3999999999996
actually stop sucking his balls at some

2979.04 --> 2985.839
point as

2980.4 --> 2985.839
as i said

2989.2 --> 2999.839
yeah that's not gonna fare well here

3015.04 --> 3018.24
yeah blue marble science but you see i

3017.359 --> 3020.5589999999997
was actually

3018.24 --> 3021.2799999999997
not talking about nathan i was talking

3020.559 --> 3025.3590000000004
about a

3021.28 --> 3027.28
baller at homing somebody else not you

3025.359 --> 3030.64
know nathan's been very on target here

3027.28 --> 3033.8390000000004
he's just been saying the technical so

3030.64 --> 3034.72
you're calling at homs well nathan's not

3033.839 --> 3037.359
doing that

3034.72 --> 3037.359
at this point

3038.4 --> 3043.119
and i was being metaphorical with

3040.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
sucking balls and all that

3043.119 --> 3055.839
i hope you understand that right

3062.72 --> 3069.52
anything dead oh yourself oh

3066.4 --> 3070.48
poor boy nathan you you must have had

3069.52 --> 3074.319
harmed him

3070.48 --> 3077.359
one time a long time ago i think

3074.319 --> 3080.4
and he's now digging up that

3077.359 --> 3082.7999999999997
that old hurt oh he's so hurt

3080.4 --> 3083.839
because you had harmed him once it's

3082.8 --> 3086.88
you're such a

3083.839 --> 3089.359
sad little boy why didn't you actually

3086.88 --> 3091.76
address anything that's nathan said

3089.359 --> 3091.7599999999998
to just

3092.64 --> 3097.04
continue the conversation instead of

3094.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
complaining about old hurts in the past

3097.04 --> 3111.839
you poor poor boy

3136.839 --> 3139.839
hmm

3143.28 --> 3145.599
ah

3148.72 --> 3152.9599999999996
well nathan look cavendish hundred six

3151.92 --> 3156.48
years out of date but

3152.96 --> 3160.2400000000002
it didn't do anything

3156.48 --> 3162.4
so even back then people might have

3160.24 --> 3163.359
assumed it had something to do with

3162.4 --> 3165.92
gravity

3163.359 --> 3167.2799999999997
but in actuality it didn't it just

3165.92 --> 3170.319
assumed gravity

3167.28 --> 3173.0400000000004
that's it that's it that's the only

3170.319 --> 3174.8
involvement of gravity in the apparatus

3173.04 --> 3177.599
but people don't understand that that

3174.8 --> 3180.88
first you have the experiment

3177.599 --> 3183.04
the hypothesis and then yeah whatever

3180.88 --> 3186.079
apparatus you're going to be using to

3183.04 --> 3189.2
demonstrate the hypothesis right

3186.079 --> 3192.319
that's how well gravity

3189.2 --> 3195.4399999999996
is only just assumed that's

3192.319 --> 3198.88
it it doesn't prove it so

3195.44 --> 3199.839
even the even outer date is not entirely

3198.88 --> 3204.88
correct it's just

3199.839 --> 3204.88
it never applied it never did

3205.52 --> 3223.839
there's no hypothesis there's no

3208.559 --> 3223.8390000000004
hypothesis for gravity

3227.05 --> 3232.969
[Music]

3236.559 --> 3240.96
no blue marble sign she didn't address

3238.8 --> 3244.0
anything he said

3240.96 --> 3246.96
not at all you're just hand waving

3244.0 --> 3246.96
and ignoring

3248.4 --> 3252.319
reasserting the same thing over and over

3262.839 --> 3265.839
again

3274.8 --> 3282.2400000000002
wow tony v no no that's not true at all

3279.28 --> 3282.799
that's that's your [ __ ] projection

3282.24 --> 3286.0789999999997
that's

3282.799 --> 3288.0
literally your [ __ ] yeah yeah

3286.079 --> 3290.1600000000003
five years later still focusing on the

3288.0 --> 3290.48
ball the goal of finding out where we

3290.16 --> 3292.48
live

3290.48 --> 3294.079
yeah yeah that's what i'm doing that's

3292.48 --> 3295.68
specifically what i've been doing with

3294.079 --> 3297.76
my show

3295.68 --> 3299.359
figuring out the possibilities no that's

3297.76 --> 3301.119
exactly what i've been doing i've been

3299.359 --> 3303.52
making progress

3301.119 --> 3305.119
you guys haven't you've only retracted

3303.52 --> 3307.599
every step of the ball you've only

3305.119 --> 3310.48
retracted you never claim the geometric

3307.599 --> 3310.48
horizon right

3310.72 --> 3314.64
and second law of thermodynamics doesn't

3312.799 --> 3317.119
apply to the earth

3314.64 --> 3319.359
right all these disclaimers disclaimers

3317.119 --> 3324.079
all these things that just completely

3319.359 --> 3326.72
wreck every original foundation

3324.079 --> 3327.76
of science the actual signs where it's

3326.72 --> 3330.64
coming from

3327.76 --> 3332.88
you've wrecked everything you've only

3330.64 --> 3335.839
retreated

3332.88 --> 3337.92
now we're not sailing around the world

3335.839 --> 3338.64
and going beyond the south pole or

3337.92 --> 3341.92
whatever

3338.64 --> 3342.96
right now yeah we know but we're

3341.92 --> 3345.44
definitely

3342.96 --> 3347.68
figuring out more about reality i am i'm

3345.44 --> 3352.0
a cosmogenius i figure out

3347.68 --> 3354.5589999999997
where what we are potentially going to

3352.0 --> 3355.119
figure out as we go it's called being a

3354.559 --> 3356.96
theorist

3355.119 --> 3359.119
it's trying to figure out what could be

3356.96 --> 3360.64
coming to expect the potentially

3359.119 --> 3362.1600000000003
unexpected

3360.64 --> 3364.72
and then even if there was something

3362.16 --> 3367.7599999999998
unexpected then figure out

3364.72 --> 3370.16
what that means right

3367.76 --> 3372.1600000000003
because the world is surreal with what

3370.16 --> 3372.72
we already know with the heavenly bodies

3372.16 --> 3374.5589999999997
it's

3372.72 --> 3377.68
quite surreal the moon is quite surreal

3374.559 --> 3380.48
and it's a natural part of everything

3377.68 --> 3382.319
this freaking celestial light that just

3380.48 --> 3384.0
comes from a direction including the sun

3382.319 --> 3387.2
but when you go to it

3384.0 --> 3389.04
you try to approach that factor

3387.2 --> 3391.68
it just moves away because it doesn't

3389.04 --> 3394.0
seem to be any object in a location now

3391.68 --> 3396.48
that's freaky

3394.0 --> 3398.24
right so there's already surreal things

3396.48 --> 3400.2400000000002
that are provably surreal

3398.24 --> 3402.0
in this realm well i am just trying to

3400.24 --> 3403.359
figure out okay what can we expect to

3402.0 --> 3405.76
bump into

3403.359 --> 3407.44
if we were to explore and what are the

3405.76 --> 3409.28
things we need to know about the

3407.44 --> 3412.319
orientation of everything

3409.28 --> 3413.28
in order to figure out what the layout

3412.319 --> 3418.16
might be

3413.28 --> 3418.559
so yeah progress absolute progress when

3418.16 --> 3421.68
you

3418.559 --> 3422.96
when you can figure out what you can

3421.68 --> 3425.52
expect

3422.96 --> 3427.52
that's progress if you can't literally

3425.52 --> 3428.72
go there but it's even better in a way

3427.52 --> 3432.079
to figure it out

3428.72 --> 3435.04
before you go

3432.079 --> 3436.6400000000003
the more unexpected things could happen

3435.04 --> 3438.48
the more frustrating what if you

3436.64 --> 3439.5989999999997
completely get lost because you end up

3438.48 --> 3442.88
in a situation that

3439.599 --> 3445.6800000000003
was completely unexpected right

3442.88 --> 3447.6800000000003
you need to figure out what unexpected

3445.68 --> 3451.1189999999997
things you might be expecting

3447.68 --> 3454.5589999999997
that's the best because

3451.119 --> 3457.76
yeah when good engaging in something

3454.559 --> 3459.76
actual exploratory if you run into

3457.76 --> 3460.079
actual unexpected situations you could

3459.76 --> 3463.28
be

3460.079 --> 3466.2400000000002
absolutely [ __ ] that's yeah

3463.28 --> 3469.28
even during the exploration age people

3466.24 --> 3470.799
supposed exploration age

3469.28 --> 3474.6400000000003
you know that's a little bit difficult

3470.799 --> 3477.839
like what was actually being explored

3474.64 --> 3480.72
but universally exploration if

3477.839 --> 3481.599
these people if you just go there just

3480.72 --> 3484.72
there without

3481.599 --> 3486.319
any kind of foresight or maps yeah

3484.72 --> 3488.72
you're gonna get lost

3486.319 --> 3490.72
and then you're gonna just die on the

3488.72 --> 3492.16
ocean or strand on some island or

3490.72 --> 3494.0
something and you don't know where you

3492.16 --> 3495.1189999999997
are you don't have a clue nobody knows

3494.0 --> 3497.44
where you are yeah so

3495.119 --> 3499.44
it's good to figure out what kind of

3497.44 --> 3500.799
things you could be expecting to bump

3499.44 --> 3503.52
into

3500.799 --> 3503.92
and that's what a theorist like me helps

3503.52 --> 3507.359
with

3503.92 --> 3507.359
so progress oh yeah

3511.119 --> 3517.52
and here again i use some stupid troll

3514.24 --> 3521.4399999999996
very low down low brow

3517.52 --> 3524.16
at homing nonsense to actually

3521.44 --> 3524.799
take it personal even though i didn't

3524.16 --> 3527.52
need to

3524.799 --> 3529.44
just to put down some justification of

3527.52 --> 3533.2
what i'm doing

3529.44 --> 3533.2000000000003
i'm really weird like that i know

3541.45 --> 3546.5589999999997
[Music]

3543.44 --> 3547.2000000000003
so yeah while i'm doing that with my

3546.559 --> 3550.3190000000004
theory

3547.2 --> 3552.64
theorizing and thinking yes you guys

3550.319 --> 3555.04
still don't know what an experiment is

3552.64 --> 3556.64
you still don't understand you still

3555.04 --> 3559.359
don't know what science is

3556.64 --> 3561.7599999999998
you keep on spouting the same nonsense

3559.359 --> 3564.4
over and over again

3561.76 --> 3566.7200000000003
because you don't want it to be like

3564.4 --> 3569.44
it's just being a stupid little kid

3566.72 --> 3570.48
trying to shove that square through the

3569.44 --> 3573.44
circular hole

3570.48 --> 3575.839
it doesn't fit don't you get it some

3573.44 --> 3578.799
point you should figure it out

3575.839 --> 3580.72
you gotta find another way in you're

3578.799 --> 3585.599
wrong

3580.72 --> 3588.0789999999997
you understand you're wrong ballers

3585.599 --> 3589.52
you're wrong blue marble signs you don't

3588.079 --> 3592.2400000000002
know what you're doing

3589.52 --> 3593.44
and you're latching on to provably

3592.24 --> 3597.1189999999997
registered

3593.44 --> 3601.28
falsehoods registered official

3597.119 --> 3614.6000000000004
falsehoods don't you get it

3601.28 --> 3617.88
why don't you listen for a while

3614.6 --> 3617.88
[Music]

3621.79 --> 3625.27
[Music]

3638.079 --> 3644.7200000000003
science education

3641.119 --> 3647.2000000000003
well what is science education

3644.72 --> 3648.24
if you're meaning like did we get

3647.2 --> 3651.04
educated

3648.24 --> 3653.359
in what science is and how it works i've

3651.04 --> 3656.4
had quite some

3653.359 --> 3659.359
in the last few years notably so

3656.4 --> 3660.319
because thanks to quantum eraser and

3659.359 --> 3662.88
every but

3660.319 --> 3665.599
different people with different styles

3662.88 --> 3669.599
and different approaches of doing things

3665.599 --> 3671.839
engaging it upturning it what is this

3669.599 --> 3673.2000000000003
what is the scientific method what is a

3671.839 --> 3678.16
phenomenon what is

3673.2 --> 3680.319
every aspect what does it mean yeah

3678.16 --> 3682.319
science education you can get more

3680.319 --> 3684.72
science education than just getting

3682.319 --> 3686.799
hardcore on the scientific method

3684.72 --> 3689.2
and really together with other people

3686.799 --> 3693.2
figuring out what is this

3689.2 --> 3694.0789999999997
trying stuff out in hypotheses it's very

3693.2 --> 3696.319
difficult

3694.079 --> 3698.0
because science is not easy you know

3696.319 --> 3701.52
that's that's the stupidest

3698.0 --> 3704.4
myth ever to say oh science is easy

3701.52 --> 3704.799
anybody can do it remember that remember

3704.4 --> 3707.52
that

3704.799 --> 3708.319
[ __ ] being pumped out and popularized

3707.52 --> 3710.48
everywhere

3708.319 --> 3711.44
oh science is easy everybody can do it

3710.48 --> 3714.96
no

3711.44 --> 3718.64
no it's not easy it's a lie

3714.96 --> 3721.119
it's the dumb stupid version

3718.64 --> 3723.1189999999997
of science that is not science it's

3721.119 --> 3725.119
nonsense

3723.119 --> 3726.96
it's just [ __ ] around and then

3725.119 --> 3728.799
thinking that you're so brilliant

3726.96 --> 3733.119
because you

3728.799 --> 3734.799
yeah it's just basic logic and nonsense

3733.119 --> 3736.6400000000003
depending on what it is that they're

3734.799 --> 3740.079
doing with it right

3736.64 --> 3744.4
it can do anything because it's not

3740.079 --> 3747.2000000000003
bound by any scientific method protocol

3744.4 --> 3748.1600000000003
that's general science that anybody can

3747.2 --> 3750.16
do now that's just

3748.16 --> 3751.7599999999998
figuring things out that's not science

3750.16 --> 3754.319
science is a method

3751.76 --> 3755.8390000000004
to figure out the cause of an effect you

3754.319 --> 3758.5589999999997
have to have a phenomenon

3755.839 --> 3760.24
you have to very manipulate it all these

3758.559 --> 3763.119
very specific

3760.24 --> 3763.5989999999997
factors very very specific and it makes

3763.119 --> 3766.6400000000003
it not

3763.599 --> 3768.7200000000003
easy it makes it not easy so

3766.64 --> 3770.799
this stupid myth science is easy anybody

3768.72 --> 3773.839
can do it no [ __ ]

3770.799 --> 3774.16
yeah anybody can memorize stuff that

3773.839 --> 3777.359
does

3774.16 --> 3779.68
but if you don't understand it

3777.359 --> 3782.0
then any nonsense that in that is in

3779.68 --> 3785.2
there you're just gonna rattle it copy

3782.0 --> 3788.559
it on and being wrong

3785.2 --> 3790.48
because you adapt it to the error

3788.559 --> 3792.4
and because you don't understand you

3790.48 --> 3797.839
can't correct it

3792.4 --> 3797.839
so you're just repeating the error

3799.13 --> 3804.48

3802.16 --> 3806.0789999999997
and i guess that's what they wanted they

3804.48 --> 3808.319
didn't want just wanted

3806.079 --> 3812.2400000000002
to make it easy for everybody to feel

3808.319 --> 3812.24
smart while they were being stupid

3812.72 --> 3816.799
and from that sense i'd say that oh

3815.119 --> 3819.52
anybody can do science is

3816.799 --> 3820.559
very likely by that effect that

3819.52 --> 3822.319
influence it has

3820.559 --> 3824.3190000000004
just saying that just doing that that

3822.319 --> 3827.2
piece of misinformation i think it's

3824.319 --> 3829.359
very likely that nasa came up with that

3827.2 --> 3831.359
because they seem to be the arbiters of

3829.359 --> 3833.359
stupid

3831.359 --> 3835.839
like really i think they're doing it on

3833.359 --> 3835.839
purpose

3836.319 --> 3840.5589999999997
it's like active mind control program to

3839.839 --> 3842.88
actively

3840.559 --> 3845.8390000000004
methodically dumb you down in as many

3842.88 --> 3845.839
ways as possible

3846.72 --> 3853.839
ever considered that nathan

3850.16 --> 3853.839
nathan's too engaged

3856.57 --> 3867.839
[Music]

3859.52 --> 3867.839
wow they're really going at it

3873.44 --> 3879.52
not a space agency a good one count

3876.48 --> 3882.64
aka eric hebelin

3879.52 --> 3882.64
no that's okay nathan

3892.88 --> 3896.4
the act of being able to learn is value

3895.68 --> 3899.44
yeah sure

3896.4 --> 3900.7200000000003
learning is valuable but it's not

3899.44 --> 3904.319
science though

3900.72 --> 3907.5989999999997
science is more specific and just by

3904.319 --> 3910.64
saying everybody can do science

3907.599 --> 3913.92
it's easy that's

3910.64 --> 3916.0789999999997
a lie it's not true it's

3913.92 --> 3918.2400000000002
misusing the word science it's like

3916.079 --> 3920.96
every if you'd say look everybody

3918.24 --> 3922.799
can figure out the world around them you

3920.96 --> 3925.359
can use logic

3922.799 --> 3927.0389999999998
why didn't they just use logic just say

3925.359 --> 3930.72
everybody can figure out things

3927.039 --> 3934.8390000000004
through logic everybody can do logic

3930.72 --> 3938.3999999999996
that's much more logical remember

3934.839 --> 3941.92
logic yeah why did they have to say

3938.4 --> 3942.48
science it's because they are trying to

3941.92 --> 3945.039
make

3942.48 --> 3947.2
science convoluted because they want to

3945.039 --> 3950.4
step away from the original

3947.2 --> 3952.5589999999997
foundations of physics so they can

3950.4 --> 3954.319
pseudoscience speculate with their

3952.559 --> 3956.7200000000003
nonsense

3954.319 --> 3958.64
and make convoluted fantastical

3956.72 --> 3959.839
structures for people to fawn over

3958.64 --> 3961.52
because they don't get it because

3959.839 --> 3963.0389999999998
they're all lost in

3961.52 --> 3964.799
and trying to figure it out it's too

3963.039 --> 3965.76
difficult i'll just leave it to the

3964.799 --> 3970.48
scientists

3965.76 --> 3970.48
right that's the trick

3970.72 --> 3976.8799999999997
but science is a method it always was

3973.839 --> 3993.839
it's the foundation of a lot of things

3976.88 --> 3993.839
figuring it out through physics

4000.319 --> 4007.119
good one robin stanley yeah

4004.24 --> 4020.72
he's just copied it's just pasting the

4007.119 --> 4024.0
same [ __ ] i think

4020.72 --> 4027.2
all science is in reality is oh

4024.0 --> 4030.799
great spelling no you're a liar that's

4027.2 --> 4034.3999999999996
not science science is a method

4030.799 --> 4039.28
and the use of the word in that fashion

4034.4 --> 4043.119
no it's logic just say it logic

4039.28 --> 4046.2400000000002
all logic is in reality

4043.119 --> 4048.6400000000003
right that's

4046.24 --> 4050.4799999999996
the real thing you use logic to figure

4048.64 --> 4053.68
things out

4050.48 --> 4056.4
science is a method to prove the cause

4053.68 --> 4058.72
of an effect

4056.4 --> 4059.76
figuring out a natural occurring

4058.72 --> 4063.839
phenomena

4059.76 --> 4063.8390000000004
right that's science

4064.16 --> 4070.48
it's not easy to just do that

4067.44 --> 4073.359
you know everybody can boil water

4070.48 --> 4074.72
on the stove or using a fire something

4073.359 --> 4077.68
right

4074.72 --> 4078.24
that's not science either no science you

4077.68 --> 4081.5989999999997
have to

4078.24 --> 4084.0
formulate what you're doing

4081.599 --> 4086.0
you have to have an hypothesis a

4084.0 --> 4088.0
formulated right

4086.0 --> 4090.96
have it all in order and then you engage

4088.0 --> 4093.76
in the experiment

4090.96 --> 4095.44
that's not part of the colloquial

4093.76 --> 4097.92
science that everybody can do no

4095.44 --> 4098.4800000000005
who's doing that no you just say

4097.92 --> 4102.08
something

4098.48 --> 4104.239
and you do it and then you predict

4102.08 --> 4105.679
you predict what do you think is logical

4104.239 --> 4107.759
that would happen

4105.679 --> 4108.96
right and they call that science that's

4107.759 --> 4112.319
not science

4108.96 --> 4114.56
that's logic

4112.319 --> 4114.56
right

4115.6 --> 4119.839
and figuring it out

4120.4 --> 4123.44
and yeah you could say falsification to

4122.719 --> 4124.799
some extent

4123.44 --> 4126.879999999999
because if you predict something it

4124.799 --> 4128.88
doesn't happen then you try to correct

4126.88 --> 4130.64
it or figure out why didn't he do it

4128.88 --> 4132.0
that's all false under large it's not a

4130.64 --> 4134.4800000000005
scientific method it's not

4132.0 --> 4134.48
science

4138.96 --> 4143.839
the word science should not be taken so

4144.839 --> 4147.839
lightly

4179.92 --> 4183.839
okay blue marble science stop whining

4183.199 --> 4187.3589999999995
about

4183.839 --> 4189.839
your [ __ ] to nathan

4187.359 --> 4191.6
and respond to his or i'm gonna ban you

4189.839 --> 4193.5199999999995
i'm sick of this [ __ ] i'm sick of

4191.6 --> 4195.6
hearing your stupid whining about your

4193.52 --> 4198.88
stupid questions that have already been

4195.6 --> 4199.360000000001
addressed right you're gonna stop it and

4198.88 --> 4202.719
i'm gonna

4199.36 --> 4205.5199999999995
kick you out

4202.719 --> 4206.96
address what nathan is saying repeat

4205.52 --> 4208.88
back to him what he's been saying

4206.96 --> 4209.36
summarize it you should be able to in

4208.88 --> 4217.84
just

4209.36 --> 4217.839999999999
half a sentence

4220.48 --> 4226.639999999999
we don't care for your stupid primitive

4224.0 --> 4231.84
little questions that are 10 steps

4226.64 --> 4231.84
behind in the actual debate here

4232.08 --> 4237.28
oh god how about what he's been saying

4235.44 --> 4240.48
why don't you read back to what he's

4237.28 --> 4243.5199999999995
been saying and then address that

4240.48 --> 4246.0
right gravity not being a force

4243.52 --> 4248.0
mass attracting mass not being a proper

4246.0 --> 4249.84
hypothesis

4248.0 --> 4251.679
what's your independent variable all

4249.84 --> 4252.8
these things why don't you all address

4251.679 --> 4256.719
that instead of just

4252.8 --> 4256.719
moving on to your [ __ ] claims

4257.36 --> 4262.88
and wave dismissing all these valid

4260.4 --> 4262.879999999999
facts

4266.0 --> 4268.32
right

4269.12 --> 4275.679
einstein gravity gravity now the current

4272.8 --> 4277.360000000001
the current version officially not

4275.679 --> 4279.92
addressing that

4277.36 --> 4280.88
newton never claimed the hypothesis mass

4279.92 --> 4284.96
attracting mass

4280.88 --> 4289.04
is not a valid hypothesis do i need to

4284.96 --> 4289.04
repeat it again and again and again

4296.96 --> 4302.56
no i'm not opening the panel you're just

4299.36 --> 4302.5599999999995
gonna have to stick the chat

4310.159 --> 4316.879999999999
oh really and how what was your response

4313.199 --> 4319.12
can you summarize that right

4316.88 --> 4321.36
how mass attracting mass is not a proper

4319.12 --> 4324.5599999999995
hypothesis how newton never claimed the

4321.36 --> 4328.48
hypothesis for his form of gravity

4324.56 --> 4331.120000000001
right science is a method

4328.48 --> 4331.919999999999
and that the current gravity officially

4331.12 --> 4335.199
registered

4331.92 --> 4338.64
is not a force so

4335.199 --> 4338.639999999999
why don't you respond to that

4339.12 --> 4343.28
i don't care if you say you've already

4341.52 --> 4344.96
done that you haven't because i would

4343.28 --> 4346.48
remember that because that would stand

4344.96 --> 4349.36
out because that meant you would

4346.48 --> 4350.48
actually answer a question and ballers

4349.36 --> 4353.679
rarely answer

4350.48 --> 4355.799999999999
a question because they it's in their

4353.679 --> 4359.04
best interest to prevent

4355.8 --> 4361.679
continuing down the road because they

4359.04 --> 4363.36
know where they're going to end up

4361.679 --> 4365.1990000000005
they know it instinctively even though

4363.36 --> 4367.92
they try to prevent themselves from

4365.199 --> 4367.919999999999
knowing they do

4368.0 --> 4385.84
so obfuscation is a primary objective

4371.679 --> 4385.84
and i'm not having it

4424.84 --> 4427.84
okay

4435.52 --> 4440.96
it's a question that has been answered

4438.4 --> 4443.839999999999
as well as can be

4440.96 --> 4443.84
for now what

4444.4 --> 4455.839999999999
how is that

4469.44 --> 4472.719
the physical law

4472.96 --> 4478.41
what physical law would that be you mean

4475.76 --> 4480.96
a supposed gravitational law

4478.41 --> 4484.48
[Music]

4480.96 --> 4486.96
law of some force thing

4484.48 --> 4487.599999999999
even though grab this can't be gravity

4486.96 --> 4489.52
right because

4487.6 --> 4491.360000000001
gravity is the bending of space-time

4489.52 --> 4494.84
it's not a force so

4491.36 --> 4496.239
which specific thing were you referring

4494.84 --> 4499.12
to

4496.239 --> 4499.12
blue marble science

4501.28 --> 4505.28
what's the name of this physical law

4507.199 --> 4512.159
because yeah

4510.239 --> 4514.159
pretty sure it's not going to be the law

4512.159 --> 4518.96
of gravity because

4514.159 --> 4518.96
that doesn't exist right

4522.239 --> 4543.08
and gravity is something else so

4539.61 --> 4543.08
[Music]

4546.82 --> 4550.009999999999
[Music]

4559.04 --> 4563.199
yeah nathan that's a tough one to get

4561.12 --> 4565.36
out look

4563.199 --> 4566.799999999999
not you being able to use the word

4565.36 --> 4570.159
theory

4566.8 --> 4570.159000000001
that's just come on

4571.04 --> 4575.679
that's tough because theory really did

4574.0 --> 4578.719
become like synonymous for

4575.679 --> 4580.88
idea except that idea is kind of

4578.719 --> 4583.679
assumed as more superficial because

4580.88 --> 4586.56
anything can be an idea

4583.679 --> 4588.0
theory is just more elaborate idea and

4586.56 --> 4591.4400000000005
that's how it's kind of

4588.0 --> 4592.88
yeah gotten in now with science i

4591.44 --> 4596.5599999999995
totally get it

4592.88 --> 4600.32
because it it stands out and so specific

4596.56 --> 4604.2390000000005
with theory come on like

4600.32 --> 4604.239
that's really tough one to get over for

4606.84 --> 4609.84
me

4620.84 --> 4626.96
foreign

4623.36 --> 4630.08
yes oh robin stanley that's

4626.96 --> 4632.4800000000005
that's just terrible in a funny way

4630.08 --> 4637.84
gravity is like love no one knows what

4632.48 --> 4637.839999999999
it is

4641.84 --> 4651.84
that's the spirit attracted to spirit it

4644.88 --> 4651.84
was very specific

4667.12 --> 4679.84
no i appreciate that rob stanley thanks

4680.719 --> 4685.12
this gravity applies to gas too

4686.32 --> 4693.84
really so what is gravity then

4689.44 --> 4696.719
that it applies to gas

4693.84 --> 4698.8
it seems like they always just slide

4696.719 --> 4700.32
back it doesn't matter how many times

4698.8 --> 4703.6
you

4700.32 --> 4707.36
you make this argument

4703.6 --> 4709.6
based on the actual official things how

4707.36 --> 4711.5199999999995
it works

4709.6 --> 4713.84
doesn't matter you you can build like

4711.52 --> 4714.2390000000005
the the next piece of the staircase but

4713.84 --> 4717.4400000000005
they

4714.239 --> 4719.44
always just slip and stumble back

4717.44 --> 4721.199
they always do it it just doesn't matter

4719.44 --> 4721.5199999999995
how many times you teach them that like

4721.199 --> 4725.12
they

4721.52 --> 4728.4800000000005
refuse to learn it like it they really

4725.12 --> 4731.36
they don't use it

4728.48 --> 4731.36
it's like they have

4731.6 --> 4735.04
these very specific things that they are

4734.08 --> 4737.12
allowed to do

4735.04 --> 4738.719
intellectually and they just like it's a

4737.12 --> 4740.08
whole range of things they're not

4738.719 --> 4743.28
allowed

4740.08 --> 4744.64
to think like that and i wonder if they

4743.28 --> 4748.08
even realize it

4744.64 --> 4751.280000000001
they're not allowed to accept certain

4748.08 --> 4754.64
things and so

4751.28 --> 4756.239
they just yeah keep on reasserting the

4754.64 --> 4758.719
same things over and over again not

4756.239 --> 4762.48
responding to anything

4758.719 --> 4765.92
like not a response

4762.48 --> 4765.919999999999
no response policy

4767.12 --> 4777.84
and now it's at home

4788.05 --> 4791.169
[Music]

4794.64 --> 4796.88
what

4802.32 --> 4808.799999999999
we're dumbing down how how exactly

4805.52 --> 4813.76
are we dumbing down the world tony

4808.8 --> 4819.84
v i take that as a grave grave insult

4813.76 --> 4819.84
that is absolutely ridiculous

4820.32 --> 4823.44
unless you're not addressing me but

4822.159 --> 4826.719
actually paula's

4823.44 --> 4828.719
i'm a little confused here

4826.719 --> 4830.8
spirits are real gravity is well i'm not

4828.719 --> 4834.2390000000005
reifying spirits

4830.8 --> 4837.84
into physics yet idiot

4834.239 --> 4840.718999999999
was literally just drawing a conspiracy

4837.84 --> 4843.12
comparison does that mean that i made a

4840.719 --> 4847.679
hypothesis claim did i

4843.12 --> 4849.76
tony v you dick

4847.679 --> 4850.719
somebody being a little triggered out

4849.76 --> 4861.84
there

4850.719 --> 4861.84
right looking for excuses to attack

4872.84 --> 4875.84
so

4886.84 --> 4889.84
uh

4898.239 --> 4904.5599999999995
that's a very bad comparison tony v

4901.04 --> 4904.56
that's absolutely ridiculous

4905.04 --> 4909.04
look if you're going to build a

4907.04 --> 4912.4
staircase

4909.04 --> 4915.679
you have to use other things than

4912.4 --> 4917.199
just just that

4915.679 --> 4919.1990000000005
i don't know what's going to be a bunch

4917.199 --> 4921.44
of leaves you're just picking up

4919.199 --> 4924.239
leaves heaping it up and then saying

4921.44 --> 4926.0
look it looks kind of like a staircase

4924.239 --> 4927.678999999999
it's not going to work you can't climb

4926.0 --> 4931.44
it you just

4927.679 --> 4933.52
crash down into a pile of leaves

4931.44 --> 4935.678999999999
it doesn't work it doesn't carry it

4933.52 --> 4938.639
doesn't carry structural integrity so

4935.679 --> 4942.08
you're the ones actually not using wood

4938.639 --> 4942.96
but you're too lazy to start picking up

4942.08 --> 4946.719
wood

4942.96 --> 4946.719
when we pointed out where it is

4947.28 --> 4950.239
you're not building it

4951.44 --> 4958.5599999999995
you just want to fantasize build it

4955.92 --> 4959.4400000000005
and then we have to play along with your

4958.56 --> 4961.76
make-believe

4959.44 --> 4962.5599999999995
game into reifying like that's worth

4961.76 --> 4965.4400000000005
anything

4962.56 --> 4967.84
and that it proves something it doesn't

4965.44 --> 4969.28
doesn't prove [ __ ] it's just stupid

4967.84 --> 4973.84
child play

4969.28 --> 4977.199
literally dumb child's play

4973.84 --> 4981.360000000001
[ __ ] doesn't prove anything you're not

4977.199 --> 4984.638999999999
using any solid foundations

4981.36 --> 4986.88
in your setups nothing

4984.639 --> 4990.400000000001
you reject everything in favor of

4986.88 --> 4992.56
philosophical liberalism

4990.4 --> 4994.32
just do whatever the [ __ ] you want

4992.56 --> 4996.400000000001
reason out whatever

4994.32 --> 4998.639
the math if you can make math say

4996.4 --> 5001.28
something

4998.639 --> 5003.04
just if you just ignore how things have

5001.28 --> 5005.5199999999995
been disproven

5003.04 --> 5009.5199999999995
then you can just continue on asserting

5005.52 --> 5009.52
this nonsense fantasy that's what you're

5012.84 --> 5015.84
doing

5017.92 --> 5021.92
it's healing it's affected by gravity

5020.639 --> 5029.84
yeah yeah

5021.92 --> 5029.84
sure it is

5039.92 --> 5045.12
that's just amazing so how does a

5043.52 --> 5046.88
balloon moving

5045.12 --> 5048.639
in the opposite direction of where

5046.88 --> 5051.679
you're accelerating at

5048.639 --> 5051.679
prove gravity

5052.96 --> 5058.4800000000005
i i take it you're not

5056.08 --> 5061.679
actually thinking that that

5058.48 --> 5064.4
scientifically proves gravity right

5061.679 --> 5066.4
because i know that applying forces is

5064.4 --> 5068.48
very interesting what it all does how it

5066.4 --> 5071.36
rearranges

5068.48 --> 5072.879999999999
enclosed material like gases and all

5071.36 --> 5075.759999999999
that yeah this place is when

5072.88 --> 5077.36
acceleration happens to a contained body

5075.76 --> 5080.639
and all it's fascinating

5077.36 --> 5083.199
right but there's no gravity though

5080.639 --> 5084.96
you think there is but you don't know

5083.199 --> 5086.799999999999
what gravity is there is however

5084.96 --> 5091.199
relative density

5086.8 --> 5091.1990000000005
this equilibrium forces happening

5091.76 --> 5098.639
and so since that counts

5095.04 --> 5102.159
as forces in both directions

5098.639 --> 5104.400000000001
right unlike gravity yeah if you apply

5102.159 --> 5105.759999999999
another force then just relative density

5104.4 --> 5108.879999999999
this equilibrium yeah

5105.76 --> 5110.56
it this place is in an apparent axis but

5108.88 --> 5113.12
it's just apparent

5110.56 --> 5115.360000000001
there's no actual gravity axis because

5113.12 --> 5119.04
gravity

5115.36 --> 5121.04
doesn't account for gas going up

5119.04 --> 5123.36
because it is less dense than the medium

5121.04 --> 5123.76
it's in it doesn't actually account for

5123.36 --> 5126.48
that

5123.76 --> 5128.8
in a heliocentric setup you know it

5126.48 --> 5130.879999999999
might account for that in some enclosed

5128.8 --> 5133.52
system but that's not what you're

5130.88 --> 5133.52
rooting for

5138.84 --> 5141.84
right

5145.199 --> 5148.32
counters nathan's silly idea that

5147.04 --> 5155.84
gravity can't ex

5148.32 --> 5155.84
what what are you blabbering about

5158.96 --> 5164.56
gravity can't that's just

5162.0 --> 5165.76
this is getting too much man it's just

5164.56 --> 5168.8
it's now just

5165.76 --> 5171.04
straight out over it lying or psychosis

5168.8 --> 5183.04
either way blue marble science is

5171.04 --> 5185.199
getting really tiresome

5183.04 --> 5187.28
because you're just conjuring gravity

5185.199 --> 5188.5599999999995
you're conjuring gravity to do things

5187.28 --> 5191.199
when officially raven

5188.56 --> 5193.52
gravity doesn't do anything relative

5191.199 --> 5196.719
density this equilibrium

5193.52 --> 5198.96
has force has influence

5196.719 --> 5199.84
right it's a passive displacement i like

5198.96 --> 5202.8
to call it or

5199.84 --> 5204.400000000001
pressure right that's proven that's

5202.8 --> 5208.159000000001
scientifically proven

5204.4 --> 5209.679
that works there's no gravity doing

5208.159 --> 5211.92
anything

5209.679 --> 5212.96
right and then yeah when you use the

5211.92 --> 5215.04
proven things

5212.96 --> 5216.96
relative density disequilibrium or

5215.04 --> 5220.239
passive displacement

5216.96 --> 5223.6
these forces measurable predictable

5220.239 --> 5226.239
provable forces manipulable

5223.6 --> 5227.76
how much force actually happens because

5226.239 --> 5229.759999999999
of relative density

5227.76 --> 5232.0
right you can literally influence the

5229.76 --> 5233.92
relative density of a medium or an

5232.0 --> 5235.84
object and then alter the amount of

5233.92 --> 5236.4
disequilibrium force that comes from

5235.84 --> 5240.0
that

5236.4 --> 5241.92
and displaces it yeah you can do that

5240.0 --> 5243.76
yourself it's very easy it's

5241.92 --> 5246.719
demonstrable

5243.76 --> 5248.719
scientific fact well if you add other

5246.719 --> 5251.92
forces to a body like that by

5248.719 --> 5253.04
taking the entire contained body

5251.92 --> 5256.8
everything that's in it

5253.04 --> 5258.4
with its different densities and then

5256.8 --> 5260.0
applying an acceleration to that

5258.4 --> 5262.4
displacing the entire body in an

5260.0 --> 5264.719
excellatory fashion yeah other force

5262.4 --> 5267.36
subtly introduces itself

5264.719 --> 5269.6
and then combining yeah yeah almost like

5267.36 --> 5271.839999999999
through newtonian mechanics almost

5269.6 --> 5273.280000000001
combines with the force of the natural

5271.84 --> 5275.679
passive displacement

5273.28 --> 5276.5599999999995
and then this apparent axis that was

5275.679 --> 5280.159
there

5276.56 --> 5282.080000000001
thanks to relative density the axis that

5280.159 --> 5284.48
just that's how it manifests

5282.08 --> 5286.4
yeah it displaces yeah so what you've

5284.48 --> 5287.919999999999
proven is not gravity because gravity

5286.4 --> 5289.679
doesn't have anything to do with that

5287.92 --> 5291.6
because it's not a force relative

5289.679 --> 5294.159
density this equilibrium however is a

5291.6 --> 5296.8
force and it expresses itself along the

5294.159 --> 5298.32
z axial alignment and if you apply

5296.8 --> 5300.400000000001
another force to it by

5298.32 --> 5301.92
taking an entire body contained body and

5300.4 --> 5303.44
then accelerating it

5301.92 --> 5305.76
then you introduce another forward and

5303.44 --> 5308.638999999999
then the apparent axis

5305.76 --> 5310.2390000000005
shifts temporarily within the enclosed

5308.639 --> 5312.400000000001
accelerating body yeah that's really

5310.239 --> 5315.759999999999
fascinating it does not prove

5312.4 --> 5317.5199999999995
gravity though because gravity is not a

5315.76 --> 5320.0
force

5317.52 --> 5321.360000000001
has nothing to do with physical reality

5320.0 --> 5324.4
in the slightest

5321.36 --> 5325.04
relative density this equilibrium force

5324.4 --> 5328.08
however

5325.04 --> 5331.44
explains it perfectly and you can

5328.08 --> 5335.36
experiment with it scientifically to

5331.44 --> 5337.599999999999
demonstrate how it works perfectly

5335.36 --> 5339.44
so yeah this force you like to talk

5337.6 --> 5341.04
about that you think is gravity it's not

5339.44 --> 5342.159
gravity it's relative density this

5341.04 --> 5344.8
equilibrium force

5342.159 --> 5346.879999999999
and it goes in both directions not all

5344.8 --> 5350.2390000000005
go down

5346.88 --> 5352.639
goes along the z axis goes up and down

5350.239 --> 5353.919999999999
depending on the density of the object

5352.639 --> 5365.84
and the medium

5353.92 --> 5365.84
and that's how it works

5374.159 --> 5379.839999999999
okay yeah you can [ __ ] off now

5380.0 --> 5384.48
stupid hand with dismissal [ __ ] i'm sick

5382.32 --> 5386.32
of it i put it all down you're just

5384.48 --> 5388.4
lying and denying

5386.32 --> 5390.08
i'm sick of it i don't want your crap in

5388.4 --> 5392.239
here anymore

5390.08 --> 5394.159
don't want some sputtering muttering

5392.239 --> 5396.718999999999
baller [ __ ] just

5394.159 --> 5397.36
acting like a complete insane mental

5396.719 --> 5400.159
patient

5397.36 --> 5402.29
echoing on the same [ __ ] lies over

5400.159 --> 5405.389999999999
and over again like some

5402.29 --> 5405.39
[Music]

5405.6 --> 5413.6
some yeah post-traumatic reenactment

5410.239 --> 5414.959999999999
that moment when it's starting to sink

5413.6 --> 5418.08
into your heart it's

5414.96 --> 5421.679
lies you're believing lies you

5418.08 --> 5423.679
are a liar you're lying to yourself

5421.679 --> 5424.2390000000005
first and foremost and it's so important

5423.679 --> 5426.4
that you keep

5424.239 --> 5429.04
lying to yourself that you're willing to

5426.4 --> 5432.799999999999
lie to everybody else for it as well

5429.04 --> 5434.719
makes you a stuttering bumbling buffoon

5432.8 --> 5436.2390000000005
lying to themselves and that's what you

5434.719 --> 5438.4800000000005
are blue marble science

5436.239 --> 5440.879999999999
i'm sick of listening to it and not even

5438.48 --> 5443.5199999999995
listening to it and reading it

5440.88 --> 5444.56
but just i recognize that [ __ ] and i'm

5443.52 --> 5446.88
not gonna

5444.56 --> 5448.88
have it anymore because you're not

5446.88 --> 5450.639
listening you're not discussing anything

5448.88 --> 5452.639
you're just reasserting the same

5450.639 --> 5454.719
crap over and over again not listening

5452.639 --> 5457.56
to any argumentation

5454.719 --> 5460.56
even though i am presenting it verbally

5457.56 --> 5460.56
uninterrupted

5460.84 --> 5463.84
right

5469.44 --> 5473.678999999999
right well nathan every time you say

5471.36 --> 5476.32
that you know i i almost have to object

5473.679 --> 5479.36
106 you're out of date

5476.32 --> 5482.4
that's almost

5479.36 --> 5482.799999999999
per default logically suggesting that it

5482.4 --> 5485.5199999999995
was

5482.8 --> 5486.88
not out of date at any point which would

5485.52 --> 5490.719
suggest that it was

5486.88 --> 5494.400000000001
scientifically valid and it never was

5490.719 --> 5494.96
so this out of date with what you do say

5494.4 --> 5497.759999999999
it

5494.96 --> 5498.8
normally right it with the pseudoscience

5497.76 --> 5501.92
so it's a

5498.8 --> 5504.400000000001
106 year out of date pseudoscience an

5501.92 --> 5505.36
official narrative that's really what it

5504.4 --> 5509.839999999999
is

5505.36 --> 5509.839999999999
right right because it was never science

5514.8 --> 5519.84
i always find it very confusing though

5517.12 --> 5519.84
when you say it

5521.12 --> 5524.5599999999995
because i'm always like but wait there

5522.639 --> 5525.36
was never a hypothesis claim so it was

5524.56 --> 5528.400000000001
never

5525.36 --> 5533.12
accepted it's just a narrative and

5528.4 --> 5537.04
like to say that at this point

5533.12 --> 5540.08
is the narrative even still important

5537.04 --> 5540.8
at this point or have they thrown up the

5540.08 --> 5543.84
gates

5540.8 --> 5546.320000000001
so much that it's literally no everybody

5543.84 --> 5549.84
can just say whatever the [ __ ] they want

5546.32 --> 5553.199
is it like that right now or is it still

5549.84 --> 5556.2390000000005
important what is pseudo

5553.199 --> 5557.599999999999
science community accepted is it still

5556.239 --> 5560.08
important in any way

5557.6 --> 5560.719
or has it become so derailed that even

5560.08 --> 5563.92
to them

5560.719 --> 5566.8
it doesn't matter anymore it literally

5563.92 --> 5569.84
doesn't matter anymore even

5566.8 --> 5570.8
what has been said at this point because

5569.84 --> 5573.360000000001
nobody's

5570.8 --> 5574.0
in or at least in the ball or arena

5573.36 --> 5576.4
nobody's

5574.0 --> 5578.639
actually sticking to the rules anymore

5576.4 --> 5581.12
everybody's just busying themselves

5578.639 --> 5581.92
trying to lawyer their way through the

5581.12 --> 5585.5199999999995
rules and

5581.92 --> 5588.56
finding every conceivable way how to not

5585.52 --> 5590.56
properly apply the rules

5588.56 --> 5592.719
that's their main focus now so they are

5590.56 --> 5594.76
if anything just anti-science it's not

5592.719 --> 5598.4
even pseudoscience anymore it's

5594.76 --> 5601.4400000000005
anti-science how do you

5598.4 --> 5603.44
derail logic and

5601.44 --> 5604.879999999999
everything in the meaning of words in

5603.44 --> 5608.719
order to reinforce

5604.88 --> 5611.92
absolute nonsensical delusion

5608.719 --> 5615.199
disprovable to no end

5611.92 --> 5618.159
how do you do that by literally

5615.199 --> 5619.839999999999
uprooting the very foundations of words

5618.159 --> 5622.96
and logic and thinking and

5619.84 --> 5625.1990000000005
everything conceivable destroy it all

5622.96 --> 5626.88
make it all worthless making it all the

5625.199 --> 5628.08
same all meaningless you can do whatever

5626.88 --> 5631.84
the [ __ ] you want

5628.08 --> 5632.4
absolute liberalism nothing means

5631.84 --> 5634.4800000000005
anything

5632.4 --> 5636.239
anymore you can say whatever the [ __ ]

5634.48 --> 5640.159
you want as long it's

5636.239 --> 5642.239
as it implies in some weird remote way

5640.159 --> 5643.679
through whatever train of thought that

5642.239 --> 5645.678999999999
the earth is a ball

5643.679 --> 5647.04
and that's the only thing that that

5645.679 --> 5649.36
matters at that point

5647.04 --> 5650.719
it's the only thing left that matters to

5649.36 --> 5655.44
you

5650.719 --> 5658.639
because nothing about what this is is

5655.44 --> 5662.638999999999
scientific or based on logic or reason

5658.639 --> 5665.76
or history

5662.639 --> 5667.84
you don't even apply your own false

5665.76 --> 5671.12
narrative history properly

5667.84 --> 5673.52
you don't even do that so it nothing

5671.12 --> 5674.159
what you do matters it's complete

5673.52 --> 5678.639
garbage

5674.159 --> 5681.5199999999995
it's beyond religious cultism

5678.639 --> 5682.2390000000005
it's religious cultism with a giant

5681.52 --> 5685.76
amount of

5682.239 --> 5690.799999999999
nonsense poured into it just giant epic

5685.76 --> 5694.2390000000005
amounts of [ __ ] so it's a pure

5690.8 --> 5698.2390000000005
spam religion the globe is a

5694.239 --> 5699.04
spam religion just snow you in with

5698.239 --> 5703.119
nonsense

5699.04 --> 5703.119
until you just you break

5704.96 --> 5715.84
and that's what it is

5729.84 --> 5733.92
freak out ooh who's freaking out exactly

5733.28 --> 5738.239
tony v

5733.92 --> 5738.2390000000005
i'm i'm just saying it as it is

5738.719 --> 5742.32
i'm describing exactly what the ball

5740.96 --> 5745.52
religion is

5742.32 --> 5747.119
it's a spam religion where everything is

5745.52 --> 5749.76
turned inside out

5747.119 --> 5751.839999999999
nothing actually matters as long as the

5749.76 --> 5754.0
end result is that the earth is a

5751.84 --> 5757.28
freaking ball like in the cgi

5754.0 --> 5757.679
and nothing else matters it's the only

5757.28 --> 5760.32
thing

5757.679 --> 5762.8
it's the death stare onto the ball it's

5760.32 --> 5763.759999999999
the final image that is etched into you

5762.8 --> 5767.4400000000005
until you can see

5763.76 --> 5770.2390000000005
nothing else but that [ __ ] ball earth

5767.44 --> 5771.28
in your view nothing else matters

5770.239 --> 5775.678999999999
anymore

5771.28 --> 5779.36
no logic no foundation no

5775.679 --> 5782.719
no honor nothing everything is bluff

5779.36 --> 5784.5599999999995
everything is bluff

5782.719 --> 5787.28
everything is tolerated everything is

5784.56 --> 5790.4800000000005
okay no matter how nasty disgusting

5787.28 --> 5791.5199999999995
insane as long as the end result is that

5790.48 --> 5799.839999999999
the earth is a

5791.52 --> 5799.84
[ __ ] ball

5810.84 --> 5813.84
do

5837.92 --> 5843.28
okay audio fight me that's uh

5841.679 --> 5845.28
an interesting question i don't know if

5843.28 --> 5846.8
nathan's here anymore

5845.28 --> 5849.36
or he might be taking a break or

5846.8 --> 5849.360000000001
something but

5849.76 --> 5853.679
like to say that at this point what

5851.84 --> 5854.08
evidence would you accept to prove this

5853.679 --> 5856.2390000000005
sphere

5854.08 --> 5858.639
earth well how about the earth being a

5856.239 --> 5861.5199999999995
ball and all the necessary effects

5858.639 --> 5863.84
that will come from it how about that

5861.52 --> 5866.4800000000005
that geometrical horizon

5863.84 --> 5866.88
about things actually dropping away and

5866.48 --> 5868.879999999999
then

5866.88 --> 5871.119
like doesn't matter how high something

5868.88 --> 5873.52
is you can never see it

5871.119 --> 5874.5599999999995
like nothing about it not a piece cut

5873.52 --> 5877.84
off

5874.56 --> 5881.6
nothing miraging no it's just never ever

5877.84 --> 5883.4400000000005
visible ever no matter how high

5881.6 --> 5885.360000000001
and you would see things completely

5883.44 --> 5886.879999999999
slanted into the distance whatever is

5885.36 --> 5888.719
left of seeing it

5886.88 --> 5890.639
everything would drop like all these

5888.719 --> 5892.08
things that are totally insane and

5890.639 --> 5895.1990000000005
surreal

5892.08 --> 5898.5599999999995
beyond their yeah it's just a warped

5895.199 --> 5900.879999999999
fuel how about that

5898.56 --> 5902.88
it doesn't happen also yeah yeah there

5900.88 --> 5904.2390000000005
is no justification for this gas

5902.88 --> 5906.4800000000005
pressure being here as long as you're

5904.239 --> 5908.718999999999
going to assume that there is a ball

5906.48 --> 5911.44
in an outer space so as long as that

5908.719 --> 5913.679
ball in an open outer space is part of

5911.44 --> 5914.638999999999
that thing that you're trying to

5913.679 --> 5916.88
reinforce

5914.639 --> 5918.159000000001
in your belief it's never going to work

5916.88 --> 5921.76
out there is

5918.159 --> 5924.719
no thing that you can say that will make

5921.76 --> 5926.639
people accept like people like nathan

5924.719 --> 5928.8
accept the ball

5926.639 --> 5929.84
because there's things that you cannot

5928.8 --> 5932.639
overcome

5929.84 --> 5933.28
things that are just not there and there

5932.639 --> 5936.2390000000005
is nothing

5933.28 --> 5936.8
like in order for somebody like nathan

5936.239 --> 5938.799999999999
or me

5936.8 --> 5940.400000000001
to accept the earth is evolved the earth

5938.8 --> 5953.84
would have to be a ball

5940.4 --> 5953.839999999999
and it's not see

5958.52 --> 5962.0
hypothetically speaking

5962.48 --> 5968.718999999999
pictures no it doesn't matter

5965.6 --> 5969.76
it doesn't matter we don't need pictures

5968.719 --> 5973.6
or models

5969.76 --> 5973.6
we got the real world out there

5974.8 --> 5981.360000000001
the earth is not a ball there is nothing

5978.08 --> 5983.119
anybody can ever do to prove the earth

5981.36 --> 5986.239
is the ball because it's not

5983.119 --> 5988.719
and it never will be

5986.239 --> 5991.04
the earth is not and never will be a

5988.719 --> 5993.679
ball

5991.04 --> 5994.32
whatever the layout of this flat earth

5993.679 --> 5997.52
thing

5994.32 --> 5999.5199999999995
maybe that's a whole nother story right

5997.52 --> 6001.52
i don't know what it is can be quite

5999.52 --> 6002.2390000000005
complicated can turn out to be quite

6001.52 --> 6005.280000000001
surreal but

6002.239 --> 6007.678999999999
one thing i do know about it it's not a

6005.28 --> 6007.679
ball

6007.76 --> 6014.8
it's not that ball that suggested

6011.679 --> 6017.52
specific sized ball it's not

6014.8 --> 6019.28
now whatever the layout is of this flat

6017.52 --> 6020.88
surface that i'm going to assume is

6019.28 --> 6023.28
perfectly flat

6020.88 --> 6025.1990000000005
because well it might be almost

6023.28 --> 6028.8
perfectly flat but it's at least

6025.199 --> 6033.5199999999995
flat enough you know i like to say that

6028.8 --> 6035.4400000000005
the earth is flat enough it's done

6033.52 --> 6038.0
for whatever imperfection in the

6035.44 --> 6039.919999999999
geometrical orientation

6038.0 --> 6041.36
that would make it not perfectly

6039.92 --> 6045.36
geometrical flat

6041.36 --> 6046.96
it's flat enough and from that vantage

6045.36 --> 6049.5199999999995
point i don't know

6046.96 --> 6051.44
however weird this layout is of the

6049.52 --> 6052.4800000000005
earth i don't know i don't fully

6051.44 --> 6054.799999999999
understand

6052.48 --> 6056.5599999999995
i have suspicions i have routes to

6054.8 --> 6059.52
figure out

6056.56 --> 6059.84
to deduce like what is it what is it

6059.52 --> 6061.92
where

6059.84 --> 6064.56
what we're in maybe there is a looping

6061.92 --> 6065.04
factor to the realm i'm not going to

6064.56 --> 6067.4400000000005
draw

6065.04 --> 6069.199
all of that in keeping it open though

6067.44 --> 6072.638999999999
but i do know that the earth is

6069.199 --> 6076.799999999999
absolutely flat enough and it will never

6072.639 --> 6078.88
be a literal geometrical ball

6076.8 --> 6080.159000000001
does it matter how the layout of this

6078.88 --> 6083.1990000000005
realm is

6080.159 --> 6084.32
however suggestible right it's never

6083.199 --> 6086.48
going to be a

6084.32 --> 6089.28
literal geometrical ball because the

6086.48 --> 6093.839999999999
earth isn't and there's no curvature

6089.28 --> 6093.84
the world is flat enough

6098.56 --> 6106.0
yeah and the layout who knows maybe

6102.719 --> 6108.159
maybe there is like this ball

6106.0 --> 6109.28
layout going on i kind of doubt it

6108.159 --> 6112.48
though but

6109.28 --> 6114.159
it might be it might be very confusing

6112.48 --> 6116.48
because what do you do with this as

6114.159 --> 6118.0
people like oh the physical world we're

6116.48 --> 6121.04
all used to it oh wait

6118.0 --> 6122.96
the realm is actually a flat ball like

6121.04 --> 6124.08
uh yeah what are you gonna do with that

6122.96 --> 6126.719
all right right

6124.08 --> 6127.119
it might be it might be it's flat though

6126.719 --> 6130.88
it's

6127.119 --> 6133.119
absolutely [ __ ] flat flat enough

6130.88 --> 6135.84
but yeah who knows maybe ah what do you

6133.119 --> 6138.08
do when the land masses interact

6135.84 --> 6139.28
on the surface on that flat surface and

6138.08 --> 6141.679
they interconnect

6139.28 --> 6143.199
as if everything is like on a ball what

6141.679 --> 6145.92
do you do with that

6143.199 --> 6148.08
are you going to assume all that means

6145.92 --> 6151.119
because of the layout that it

6148.08 --> 6152.5599999999995
must be retro boy even though it's

6151.119 --> 6154.4
absolutely flat

6152.56 --> 6156.080000000001
right yeah you're gonna [ __ ] yourself up

6154.4 --> 6158.4
are you gonna one day just blow your

6156.08 --> 6162.32
brains out because you can't reconcile

6158.4 --> 6166.0
that why does it seem like a ball

6162.32 --> 6168.0
but it's flat oh no i can't handle life

6166.0 --> 6169.84
anymore because it's too confusing is

6168.0 --> 6170.719
that gonna happen i don't know man i

6169.84 --> 6174.719
don't know

6170.719 --> 6175.119
i don't really care it might be a flat

6174.719 --> 6178.96
ball

6175.119 --> 6182.159
that's all just fine but what i do know

6178.96 --> 6186.0
is it's not a geometrical

6182.159 --> 6191.36
literal sphere okay

6186.0 --> 6193.04
there's no evidence for this

6191.36 --> 6195.92
right and i'm gonna round out the show

6193.04 --> 6197.84
now so thanks everyone for coming

6195.92 --> 6199.76
i hope you liked the show i thought it

6197.84 --> 6201.52
was pretty good it was amusing uh

6199.76 --> 6203.52
especially with nathan and a couple of

6201.52 --> 6205.92
ballers going back and forth in there

6203.52 --> 6207.6
and me also being part of that

6205.92 --> 6209.36
being drawn and just laying out the

6207.6 --> 6211.84
arguments on my own shows

6209.36 --> 6214.159
is good because then i know i'm gonna be

6211.84 --> 6214.159000000001
heard

6215.199 --> 6218.799999999999
if you like the show then please don't

6217.199 --> 6220.638999999999
forget to rogan's it up and

6218.8 --> 6222.4800000000005
if you haven't already subscribe to my

6220.639 --> 6224.08
channel and hit the bell notification so

6222.48 --> 6226.32
you know when i'm going live

6224.08 --> 6227.199
which is normally 1 pm amsterdam time

6226.32 --> 6229.44
every day

6227.199 --> 6231.119
and please also do support me through

6229.44 --> 6233.28
the paypal patreon super chat and a

6231.119 --> 6235.04
membership system join button

6233.28 --> 6236.8
that'd be much appreciated and thank you

6235.04 --> 6239.199
again nathan earlier for the

6236.8 --> 6241.119000000001
paypal donation and everybody else

6239.199 --> 6245.119
please keep it coming and

6241.119 --> 6245.119
i can really i kind of need it right now

6245.679 --> 6249.84
but i'll survive as i always do it's

6248.4 --> 6252.96
always this last week

6249.84 --> 6254.2390000000005
every month anyway i will be back

6252.96 --> 6256.8
tomorrow

6254.239 --> 6259.36
on a monday again the flat earth early

6256.8 --> 6263.679
bird number 781 and i hope

6259.36 --> 6267.759999999999
not going to be that late and

6263.679 --> 6267.76
hashtag mifa anyone let me see

6269.119 --> 6305.17
right until the next video keep it flat

6274.82 --> 6305.17
[Music]

6325.84 --> 6327.92
you
