if I'd say anything

123.06 --> 130.22
it wasn't much clearer earlier but yeah

126.0 --> 130.22
there's clouds up there rushing

130.86 --> 135.98000000000002
and then it's like rushing a lot and

133.14 --> 135.98
there's a lot of wind

136.14 --> 141.66
lots of leaves getting blown

138.78 --> 144.12
of the trees

141.66 --> 146.7
trees right across of me are really

144.12 --> 150.56
starting to balled up

146.7 --> 150.56
already with this wind

150.84 --> 155.459
there has been a bit of rain too

152.4 --> 158.09900000000002
especially yesterday night

155.459 --> 161.34
it was like a pretty heavy lightning

158.099 --> 163.79999999999998
storm although it it was in the distance

161.34 --> 166.62
but I mean the the flashes that came off

163.8 --> 169.31900000000002
that were so bright

166.62 --> 172.31900000000002
it's incredible

169.319 --> 173.76
but like almost never any Thunder even

172.319 --> 175.92
reached me

173.76 --> 179.239
but just kept flashing from the outside

175.92 --> 179.23899999999998
and really bright

180.54 --> 183.9
right anyway

186.13 --> 189.25
[Music]

196.08 --> 201.18
hello Susie s first in chat good to see

198.959 --> 208.379
you psych bear

201.18 --> 208.37900000000002
it is Monday the 24th of October 2022

208.8 --> 212.9
yeah I didn't have a show yesterday

212.94 --> 217.92
on Sunday because I was kind of sick

216.42 --> 220.73899999999998
I

217.92 --> 223.099
had a really good day Saturday but yeah

220.739 --> 223.09900000000002
yeah

224.34 --> 229.98
I think I uh overdid it a little bit on

227.58 --> 233.459
the beer

229.98 --> 235.85999999999999
tapped into my this is into my Bears off

233.459 --> 237.959
the Sunday and that was afterwards a

235.86 --> 239.70000000000002
mistake also because I didn't really eat

237.959 --> 241.31900000000002
all that well so it was a bit of a weird

239.7 --> 243.29899999999998
Saturday

241.319 --> 245.7
and then the next day I just did not

243.299 --> 249.65900000000002
feel great

245.7 --> 252.5
so yeah I had just didn't do the show

249.659 --> 252.5
and instead

253.439 --> 257.579
had like a shower

255.599 --> 260.579
a good walk outside with much better

257.579 --> 262.079
weather a lot of people were outside saw

260.579 --> 264.78000000000003
some interesting things lots of

262.079 --> 266.46000000000004
mushrooms everywhere all of a sudden

264.78 --> 270.71999999999997
and there was a

266.46 --> 273.23999999999995
like a a horde of storks

270.72 --> 275.82000000000005
40 of them I've never seen that many

273.24 --> 278.16
storks altogether at once ever

275.82 --> 280.919
but they were right there

278.16 --> 283.5
just sitting in the field

280.919 --> 287.52
so that was interesting

283.5 --> 291.66
uh also been actually tapping into some

287.52 --> 294.419
of my ultimate bone broth

291.66 --> 297.0
for Recovery yesterday and that that

294.419 --> 299.03999999999996
really did help so I did get some again

297.0 --> 302.72
today

299.04 --> 302.72
and yeah it's good stuff

305.94 --> 311.6
and it works really well

308.1 --> 311.6
for like recovery

314.16 --> 319.52000000000004
all right

315.419 --> 322.19899999999996
so yeah I know I am a lot better now

319.52 --> 324.44
like I feel better than I did on

322.199 --> 324.44
Saturday

326.699 --> 330.6
and the day before so yeah I just needed

329.28 --> 333.67999999999995
that I guess

330.6 --> 333.68
they often

334.32 --> 340.8
like apparently yeah no drinks barely

338.52 --> 342.9
any like I had one beer that was still

340.8 --> 345.24
leftovers

342.9 --> 346.44
but yeah that was good just little beer

345.24 --> 348.84000000000003
a good

346.44 --> 352.44
had good dinners and all that

348.84 --> 355.33
so I feel a lot better right hello at

352.44 --> 358.42
least LSG let's see you

355.33 --> 358.41999999999996
[Music]

361.1 --> 367.639
right so I'm all fresh enough

364.74 --> 367.639
ready to go

369.06 --> 372.06
uh

372.78 --> 378.55999999999995
yesterday was really devoid of Screams

376.08 --> 378.56
in general

379.08 --> 382.52
there's not a lot going around

384.539 --> 391.62
no bimbob stream and

388.5 --> 395.06
it was an interesting concept Quantum of

391.62 --> 395.06
conscious video again

400.59 --> 405.9
[Music]

402.96 --> 408.18
did also upload a couple of funny videos

405.9 --> 410.12
more deep fakes

408.18 --> 414.62
pretty cool

410.12 --> 414.62
uh and that was it

418.919 --> 425.81899999999996
oh oh yeah and flats are trying

422.039 --> 428.039
went live but then like his computer or

425.819 --> 432.6
something broke down it was really weird

428.039 --> 436.699
because like two hours after that broke

432.6 --> 436.699
the live video was still rolling

436.979 --> 441.419
but it would yeah it would always just

438.96 --> 445.039
break at that last second and but it

441.419 --> 445.039
didn't end that was really weird

446.099 --> 448.88
uh

457.62 --> 463.759
all right so that roughly summarizes

460.8 --> 463.759
what I was doing yesterday

463.96 --> 467.089
[Music]

484.08 --> 490.8
it's kind of weird because today this

487.38 --> 493.979
bone broth thing is not feeling as good

490.8 --> 496.5
as it did yesterday it's weird yes they

493.979 --> 500.039
have really hit the spot

496.5 --> 501.72
now it's like yeah it's still good but

500.039 --> 504.3
I feel almost like I don't need it

501.72 --> 506.759
anymore it's weird

504.3 --> 509.699
but anyway yeah me instead of can do

506.759 --> 512.099

adrenaline and I'm talking when I'm much

818.94 --> 824.7600000000001
younger when I was much younger

[Music]

1079.039 --> 1084.28
what about it Aries 106 I mean seriously

1097.12 --> 1102.32
food truck passport no I've never heard

1100.34 --> 1105.52
anything about that so you can start

1102.32 --> 1105.52
water no sign of that

1107.24 --> 1110.08
foreign

1116.74 --> 1122.48
however is that at the Mississippi River

1119.66 --> 1124.88
or whatever there's all kinds of food

1122.48 --> 1128.799
transport issues because they normally

1124.88 --> 1128.7990000000002
use that River and it's gone dry

1129.26 --> 1133.22
don't know if that's still the case I

1131.12 --> 1136.059
mean that might might have been a summer

1133.22 --> 1136.059
thing or something

1139.58 --> 1142.1789999999999
foreign

1145.13 --> 1151.66

no I did not see that huh

1157.76 --> 1162.22
are ghosts real yeah

1169.7 --> 1174.38
is there any point to

1172.22 --> 1177.76
getting obsessed over that and being

1174.38 --> 1177.7600000000002
scared of it no

1182.14 --> 1185.3390000000002
[Music]

1186.62 --> 1191.6599999999999
getting obsessed with ghosts and [ __ ] is

1189.74 --> 1194.84
not that different from like getting

1191.66 --> 1197.539
obsessed with a living psychopath

1194.84 --> 1201.28
it's dangerous potentially

1197.539 --> 1201.28
and it's not really worth it

1203.93 --> 1207.17
[Music]

1215.6 --> 1219.82
got anything else Aries 106

1224.48 --> 1229.16
or are you just

1226.6 --> 1230.48
spitting things out of your mouth you

1229.16 --> 1232.52
don't really want to talk about it you

1230.48 --> 1235.7
don't seem extremely interested

1232.52 --> 1238.94
otherwise you would have well

1235.7 --> 1240.52
responded to my inquiry what about it

1238.94 --> 1243.72
and you haven't

1240.52 --> 1243.72
[Music]

1244.64 --> 1248.24
silly topics oh you think that's silly

1247.16 --> 1249.38
do you

1248.24 --> 1253.059
I don't

1249.38 --> 1253.0590000000002
you know what I think is silly

1253.58 --> 1259.96
moon mission launches

1256.22 --> 1259.96
that's what I think is silly

1265.74 --> 1278.66
[Music]

1275.179 --> 1282.22
I've never seen anything that confirms

1278.66 --> 1285.559
to me that any of that is real

1282.22 --> 1288.74
wow I have seen plenty of things to

1285.559 --> 1293.4189999999999
prove to me that ghosts are real

1288.74 --> 1295.52
well ghost would be in a catch or word

1293.419 --> 1297.98
for all these different types of things

1295.52 --> 1300.62
that are very different from one another

1297.98 --> 1302.539
that we identify as ghosts

1300.62 --> 1305.1789999999999
yeah

1302.539 --> 1308.48
I know that's real because of my own

1305.179 --> 1311.48
personal experience and research that I

1308.48 --> 1314.24
was able to do here on Earth

1311.48 --> 1315.799
like with my own eyes and ears and

1314.24 --> 1319.1
pineal gland

1315.799 --> 1322.96
so yeah I know that's real

1319.1 --> 1322.9599999999998
moon landings not real

1333.919 --> 1340.9
thousands of U.S troops get really

1337.88 --> 1340.9
are they really

1342.559 --> 1347.059
wow

1345.08 --> 1349.6589999999999
because

1347.059 --> 1349.6589999999999
well

1358.159 --> 1361.3600000000001
best of luck

1363.5 --> 1366.62
just so you know like Putin's not gonna

1365.659 --> 1369.2
like

1366.62 --> 1370.9399999999998
or Russia I should say is not gonna

1369.2 --> 1373.4
spare you

1370.94 --> 1375.44
if you're gonna sit in Ukraine while the

1373.4 --> 1377.0
real [ __ ] hits the fan

1375.44 --> 1379.5800000000002
because

1377.0 --> 1383.36
yeah

1379.58 --> 1385.76
Russia's been very mild

1383.36 --> 1388.039
up to this point

1385.76 --> 1391.48
and it's very likely that they're gonna

1388.039 --> 1391.48
up the gear

1391.88 --> 1399.44
and you don't know to what could be to a

1395.179 --> 1401.0400000000002
very high gear and yeah I wouldn't want

1399.44 --> 1402.679
to be any troops

1401.04 --> 1405.6
[Music]

1402.679 --> 1408.8400000000001
in Ukraine when that happens

1405.6 --> 1408.84
[Music]

1414.08 --> 1420.08
that you saw Adam Sandler okay cool

1417.85 --> 1421.62
[Music]

1420.08 --> 1424.84
huh

1421.62 --> 1424.84
[Music]

1434.86 --> 1440.84
okay if you just seen that that's cool

1437.72 --> 1441.6200000000001
yeah I saw a vivid Spirit of my own

1440.84 --> 1445.22
mother

1441.62 --> 1448.1589999999999
like when it was very dark

1445.22 --> 1450.38
three o'clock at night I'll never forget

1448.159 --> 1452.9
I was Pitch Black no lights on except

1450.38 --> 1455.659
for inside of the house but not that was

1452.9 --> 1457.64
shining directly like upon the garden

1455.659 --> 1459.919
that was standing there

1457.64 --> 1463.88
and then I saw

1459.919 --> 1467.9
well this very standout type of white

1463.88 --> 1470.659
Veil that was like its own dim light

1467.9 --> 1473.0
and that was literally visual that was

1470.659 --> 1475.5800000000002
not some weird

1473.0 --> 1479.919
inner mind thing that was just like a

1475.58 --> 1479.9189999999999
white Veil that just crept up

1482.36 --> 1488.84
approached did not feel scary

1486.559 --> 1491.4189999999999
and then like it touched me on the

1488.84 --> 1494.48
forehead and then I got locked into like

1491.419 --> 1497.539
a separate Vision interface and saw my

1494.48 --> 1500.84
mother's face when she was really young

1497.539 --> 1503.0
like when she was around 20 I think

1500.84 --> 1505.48
which of course in my actual life I've

1503.0 --> 1505.48
never seen

1507.799 --> 1511.94
except maybe as a baby

1509.96 --> 1515.24
right so

1511.94 --> 1518.299
yeah that one sealed the deal because

1515.24 --> 1520.7
before that I was always

1518.299 --> 1523.1
sensitive in a sense that I could feel I

1520.7 --> 1524.96
could feel presences I could feel like

1523.1 --> 1527.0
Remnant energies I could feel when a

1524.96 --> 1529.3400000000001
house was haunted and how

1527.0 --> 1533.84
it was very good with that but I have

1529.34 --> 1536.1789999999999
not visually seen apparitions a lot I

1533.84 --> 1537.9189999999999
feel them out a lot sooner than I

1536.179 --> 1540.5590000000002
actually see something usually when I

1537.919 --> 1543.38
start to see something it's a sign that

1540.559 --> 1544.039
I'm actually retracting my empathy a

1543.38 --> 1546.6200000000001
little

1544.039 --> 1549.02
usually because of emotional distress

1546.62 --> 1550.9399999999998
well hey my mother was dying so I was in

1549.02 --> 1553.8799999999999
emotional distress

1550.94 --> 1555.3200000000002
and then for some reason my feelings

1553.88 --> 1558.3200000000002
don't just

1555.32 --> 1560.12
catch everything and if it's important I

1558.32 --> 1562.1589999999999
guess sometimes

1560.12 --> 1564.9799999999998
in such cases

1562.159 --> 1567.919
apparitions may become more visual

1564.98 --> 1571.659
that is the only real mechanical

1567.919 --> 1571.659
conclusion I would have drawn from that

1574.279 --> 1580.4
because yeah when I feel great I don't

1576.799 --> 1584.4189999999999
really see ghosts and I've seen other

1580.4 --> 1587.1200000000001
people see ghosts in my presence

1584.419 --> 1588.38
and I would feel it and I would not see

1587.12 --> 1591.76
it visually

1588.38 --> 1591.7600000000002
it's like I didn't need to

1594.98 --> 1600.02
I don't know

1596.539 --> 1600.02
anyway ghosts

1600.98 --> 1603.98
spooky

1625.279 --> 1628.279
foreign

1629.26 --> 1635.72
[Music]

1632.72 --> 1635.72
buildings

1638.24 --> 1642.02
like building a train without train

1639.98 --> 1645.279
tracks

1642.02 --> 1645.279
[Music]

1651.5 --> 1655.4
right

1652.02 --> 1657.98
[Music]

1655.4 --> 1660.279
it's it's like an Airborne trip to

1657.98 --> 1660.279
nowhere

1673.26 --> 1680.289
[Music]

1685.159 --> 1690.919
hilarious at least G

1687.5 --> 1692.51
but I gotta give it to you when I was

1690.919 --> 1694.64
still full on ball win

1692.51 --> 1697.039
[Music]

1694.64 --> 1699.5
that's what I'm saying what am I saying

1697.039 --> 1700.94
when I was full on board

1699.5 --> 1705.2
when I

1700.94 --> 1707.919
was still a global space enthusiast

1705.2 --> 1707.919
uh

1708.38 --> 1714.2
I always noticed that

1710.659 --> 1716.5
ghosts didn't really connect to it it's

1714.2 --> 1716.5
like

1716.6 --> 1726.2199999999998
ball earth science space it makes

1721.72 --> 1726.22
ghosts seem more trivial

1726.98 --> 1730.7
right it's like

1728.91 --> 1732.98
[Music]

1730.7 --> 1734.8400000000001
it's like there's probably nothing but

1732.98 --> 1736.88
even if there was something it's not

1734.84 --> 1739.6399999999999
really relevant that's always how I saw

1736.88 --> 1742.4
it then and it's really like the my

1739.64 --> 1744.26
interest in the occult and Mysteries

1742.4 --> 1746.539
like for example one of these things

1744.26 --> 1749.299
Moonlight being cold which I did

1746.539 --> 1751.8799999999999
discover pretty early

1749.299 --> 1756.679
like those are the things that then

1751.88 --> 1760.159
suddenly make things like ghosts seem

1756.679 --> 1761.419
more appealing because it's like wow but

1760.159 --> 1763.5800000000002
there are all these things that we take

1761.419 --> 1766.779
for granted that just turn out not to be

1763.58 --> 1770.059
the case which completely like

1766.779 --> 1771.679
dislocates like the kohiji the seeming

1770.059 --> 1773.779
cohesion of it all

1771.679 --> 1775.8200000000002
and then suddenly it's like oh but if

1773.779 --> 1777.679
that's the case then

1775.82 --> 1779.98
then what's that about about this ghost

1777.679 --> 1779.98
stuff

1786.2 --> 1790.3400000000001
right because

1788.059 --> 1793.6399999999999
when I was still talk thinking about

1790.34 --> 1797.1789999999999
ball Earth and space and Rockets I would

1793.64 --> 1800.72
just be more like oh what about

1797.179 --> 1803.48
a space Bridge or

1800.72 --> 1805.3990000000001
like a space elevator like a space

1803.48 --> 1807.38
station how could you make it efficient

1805.399 --> 1810.9399999999998
blah blah like I would just be thinking

1807.38 --> 1810.94
about that sort of stuff a lot

1811.279 --> 1814.899
could get very creative with it

1815.899 --> 1820.6999999999998
starting out with Legos space Legos of

1819.5 --> 1823.279
course

1820.7 --> 1825.14
and then later also like withdrawing and

1823.279 --> 1830.12
trying to figure out like for computer

1825.14 --> 1832.5800000000002
games but yeah space stuff

1830.12 --> 1835.279
was always very interesting to me in a

1832.58 --> 1838.1589999999999
way it is still it's just that I have

1835.279 --> 1840.62
come to realize like that's never

1838.159 --> 1845.2990000000002
actually literally gonna happen

1840.62 --> 1845.299
it will always be fiction forever

1846.2 --> 1852.8600000000001
and that that does kind of pull back

1849.14 --> 1855.2
some of the enthusiasm for it the appeal

1852.86 --> 1858.02
because you know like you're not

1855.2 --> 1861.22
actually developing technology or

1858.02 --> 1861.22
something not really

1865.159 --> 1870.74
but yeah just looking around at space

1868.039 --> 1872.6589999999999
movies now some of those that are

1870.74 --> 1874.82
actually kind of cool

1872.659 --> 1877.3400000000001
then you get it like yeah but you can

1874.82 --> 1879.4399999999998
really steal technologically build that

1877.34 --> 1882.1399999999999
dream and

1879.44 --> 1883.88
people will catch it we'll catch parts

1882.14 --> 1885.919
of that dream and integrate it into

1883.88 --> 1888.679
their project so

1885.919 --> 1891.64
it's not an entire waste

1888.679 --> 1891.64
in that sense

1897.02 --> 1901.1
you used an asteroid as a concept but

1899.299 --> 1904.6399999999999
that's pretty cool because that's

1901.1 --> 1905.9599999999998
roughly my idea as well except not a

1904.64 --> 1909.1000000000001
rock

1905.96 --> 1909.1000000000001
it would just be

1916.34 --> 1923.1999999999998
like a well a space station

1919.94 --> 1923.2
but a bigger one

1923.72 --> 1928.7
and then like

1925.7 --> 1932.74
try to what is it geosynchronous orbit

1928.7 --> 1932.74
and then connect the chain

1933.2 --> 1937.94
and then like the distance of the

1936.559 --> 1939.9189999999999
spinning Earth

1937.94 --> 1941.0
to the station like the bigger the

1939.919 --> 1943.279
distance

1941.0 --> 1946.34
the more the centripetal force would

1943.279 --> 1948.62
then pull that chain straight so it

1946.34 --> 1950.12
would literally be slung

1948.62 --> 1952.039
right

1950.12 --> 1954.1399999999999
that the distance

1952.039 --> 1956.36
to the earth center

1954.14 --> 1959.179
would make this station

1956.36 --> 1962.299
lit well literally connected

1959.179 --> 1964.3400000000001
through a chain and then like maximize

1962.299 --> 1966.86
that distance so that the centripetal

1964.34 --> 1969.02
force

1966.86 --> 1972.1999999999998
would actually pull the chain straight

1969.02 --> 1975.34
that was my idea

1972.2 --> 1975.3400000000001
it kind of still is

1976.6 --> 1980.1399999999999
[Music]

1980.32 --> 1984.9399999999998
ever left the country yes

1986.96 --> 1990.039
the [ __ ]

1992.299 --> 1997.58
are there ghosts in space there's no

1994.58 --> 2001.86
space so no there's no nothing nothing

1997.58 --> 2001.86
is in a place that doesn't exist

2011.86 --> 2018.7199999999998
and typically ghosts can only be found

2015.399 --> 2018.7199999999998
where there is

2019.299 --> 2024.6399999999999
of their spirits

2021.76 --> 2029.1589999999999
Living spirit so ghosts typically arrive

2024.64 --> 2029.159
where there were at least people

2030.94 --> 2036.64
and then I guess they sometimes linger

2034.36 --> 2037.9599999999998
even when things get abandoned and you

2036.64 --> 2042.3400000000001
could see it as like they're just

2037.96 --> 2044.32
waiting to reintegrate with the group

2042.34 --> 2046.36
they're basically hoping something will

2044.32 --> 2049.179
come back

2046.36 --> 2050.44
make the place live again as when they

2049.179 --> 2053.32
were alive

2050.44 --> 2056.2200000000003
so that they can just like reintegrate

2053.32 --> 2056.2200000000003
with the spirit pool

2056.5 --> 2061.119
not talking yeah this is more like

2058.599 --> 2064.78
dwelling Spirits not actual ghosts which

2061.119 --> 2068.28
are just echoes absorbed by

2064.78 --> 2068.28
material like wood

2068.379 --> 2073.179
that's different those are just Echoes

2070.72 --> 2077.4399999999996
that's not really a living entity and

2073.179 --> 2080.679
those also do faint over time I think

2077.44 --> 2083.94
the living Spirits are more Elusive and

2080.679 --> 2083.94
they can hang around

2085.599 --> 2091.3
and that's the question why why do they

2089.32 --> 2093.46
hang around

2091.3 --> 2095.8
and even through popular ghost

2093.46 --> 2097.359
storytelling and through what mediums

2095.8 --> 2099.4
have done with ghosts and or with

2097.359 --> 2100.5989999999997
spirits and trying to send them to the

2099.4 --> 2102.58
afterlife

2100.599 --> 2104.2000000000003
so that they hang around for a reason

2102.58 --> 2105.8199999999997
they hang around

2104.2 --> 2107.6189999999997
usually because they're waiting on

2105.82 --> 2110.099
something to happen for something to be

2107.619 --> 2110.099
fulfilled

2112.42 --> 2117.52
yeah and I have by the way done that I

2116.32 --> 2119.8590000000004
foreign

2117.52 --> 2122.56
I teamed up with a medium who also

2119.859 --> 2125.44
channeled Aiea at some point

2122.56 --> 2129.099
and actually sent several people

2125.44 --> 2130.78
ghosts or spirits that were dwelling

2129.099 --> 2134.1400000000003
that we picked up

2130.78 --> 2136.48
and then I would be the communicator

2134.14 --> 2139.2999999999997
with them I would be basically a spirit

2136.48 --> 2144.96
therapist and I had helped send

2139.3 --> 2144.96
to send some spirits to be Beyond

2145.9 --> 2150.42
that was very satisfying thing to do by

2148.18 --> 2150.4199999999996
the way

2156.82 --> 2159.82
foreign

2171.54 --> 2178.06
each other become a single no

2175.18 --> 2180.7799999999997
not really at least G I mean they might

2178.06 --> 2183.52
team up and form a union

2180.78 --> 2185.619
they don't actually be they are all

2183.52 --> 2187.06
separate Consciousness if it's not a

2185.619 --> 2190.38
separate conscious it's not even a

2187.06 --> 2190.38
spirit that is more like a ghost

2196.06 --> 2198.72
right

2198.9 --> 2203.56
but they can like

2201.579 --> 2206.92
join together and have one

2203.56 --> 2210.7599999999998
representative but this is getting all

2206.92 --> 2213.2200000000003
a bit too yeah extremes

2210.76 --> 2214.96
I've never personally like encountered

2213.22 --> 2216.7599999999998
that but I would notice like if there

2214.96 --> 2218.44
are several spirits that they would all

2216.76 --> 2220.0
like a group

2218.44 --> 2222.52
just

2220.0 --> 2225.24
behave more like a group

2222.52 --> 2225.24
weird

2228.76 --> 2231.82
oh my God

2230.619 --> 2234.4
why

2231.82 --> 2236.56
why is that your favorite thing because

2234.4 --> 2239.44
it was absolutely ridiculous and made

2236.56 --> 2241.119
Flat Earth look stupid Ares 106 is that

2239.44 --> 2244.14
why it was your favorite thing that

2241.119 --> 2244.1400000000003
happened in a long time

2256.839 --> 2259.839
foreign

2262.56 --> 2267.699
yeah psych bear I know

2264.54 --> 2267.699
[Music]

2288.92 --> 2292.12
[Music]

2291.04 --> 2295.34
uh

2292.12 --> 2295.3399999999997
[Music]

2298.76 --> 2303.2000000000003
[Music]

2318.48 --> 2323.339
but it's an interesting thought at least

2321.099 --> 2323.339
you

2323.68 --> 2326.2799999999997
foreign

2326.4 --> 2331.9
things get more complex in the situation

2329.619 --> 2333.6400000000003
with a lot of spirits then yeah it makes

2331.9 --> 2336.099
sense that there will be some that will

2333.64 --> 2339.9
simply not be

2336.099 --> 2339.9
good at communicating even

2342.76 --> 2349.0600000000004
and it will be the more communicatively

2345.64 --> 2351.16
talented spirits well that would have

2349.06 --> 2353.92
been Spirits from people that had that

2351.16 --> 2356.64
talent that might do the communication

2353.92 --> 2356.64
with the living

2357.579 --> 2360.119
all right

2361.54 --> 2366.7599999999998
yeah because Spirits if you're even able

2364.48 --> 2368.7400000000002
to like really connect intellectually

2366.76 --> 2372.099
somehow

2368.74 --> 2376.54
they're not necessarily smart

2372.099 --> 2378.7000000000003
I mean Spirits are just as stupid as

2376.54 --> 2382.2
people

2378.7 --> 2382.2
because they are people

2382.9 --> 2388.3
right just because certain things have

2385.359 --> 2390.16
been lifted like a veil from their eyes

2388.3 --> 2392.76
doesn't mean that they're now subtly

2390.16 --> 2392.7599999999998
brilliant

2394.619 --> 2400.32
or have talented that they never used to

2397.3 --> 2400.32
have being alive

2426.76 --> 2432.82
Sun holds both in the heliocentric model

2429.76 --> 2435.7000000000003
really so the Sun's gravity is holding

2432.82 --> 2439.3
both then why isn't everything Falling

2435.7 --> 2442.98
Towards the Sun a Google virus

2439.3 --> 2442.98
that uh

2452.76 --> 2460.6800000000003
orbit da oh really duh

2457.96 --> 2460.68
right

2470.68 --> 2476.8199999999997
so an orbit is holding things in your

2473.74 --> 2480.3999999999996
gravitational pull yet not

2476.82 --> 2482.44
actually pulling them

2480.4 --> 2484.42
so there's a pool

2482.44 --> 2487.2400000000002
but it doesn't actually pull them

2484.42 --> 2489.76
because

2487.24 --> 2491.4399999999996
it's so easy akumu if you [ __ ] say

2489.76 --> 2493.119
that in my chat one more time I'm

2491.44 --> 2496.54
Banning you forever

2493.119 --> 2498.579
shut your [ __ ] mouth it's pretty easy

2496.54 --> 2501.22
to understand if you see you say that

2498.579 --> 2503.32
one more [ __ ] time akumo virus I'm

2501.22 --> 2504.7599999999998
kicking you out and you'll never be

2503.32 --> 2506.56
coming back

2504.76 --> 2510.3390000000004
yeah

2506.56 --> 2512.7999999999997
don't [ __ ] Gaslight your own farts in

2510.339 --> 2515.7999999999997
here okay

2512.8 --> 2519.78
[ __ ] off with that [ __ ]

2515.8 --> 2519.78
it's all virtual anyway

2525.26 --> 2529.429
[Music]

2530.2 --> 2534.8999999999996
can you get the [ __ ] out of here

2535.0 --> 2540.579
nobody gives about your incessant

2537.82 --> 2542.26
whining about how I conduct my Show's

2540.579 --> 2545.2200000000003
[ __ ]

2542.26 --> 2545.2200000000003
[ __ ] off

2557.55 --> 2563.3
[Music]

2567.22 --> 2574.8999999999996
right so let's get back

2570.46 --> 2577.66
to orbits and gravitational pull right

2574.9 --> 2579.76
so something is orbiting let's get

2577.66 --> 2582.94
mechanical here yeah something is

2579.76 --> 2585.8390000000004
orbiting that means it is in the pull of

2582.94 --> 2589.78
the gravitation that means oh

2585.839 --> 2591.819
a directional thing a force yeah

2589.78 --> 2594.7200000000003
um it's pulling but it's not coming

2591.819 --> 2594.72
closer though

2595.839 --> 2602.38
because it's also being

2598.599 --> 2605.319
shut off it's like falling around it in

2602.38 --> 2606.46
an equilibrium somehow

2605.319 --> 2608.619
right

2606.46 --> 2610.06
well that's the condition of the

2608.619 --> 2613.1800000000003
preponderance

2610.06 --> 2614.7999999999997
of the material

2613.18 --> 2617.2599999999998
yeah

2614.8 --> 2620.319
what it's doing in relation to the other

2617.26 --> 2623.2000000000003
body of material

2620.319 --> 2625.72
yeah and then there's an equilibrium

2623.2 --> 2627.8799999999997
that's how that thing then spins at a

2625.72 --> 2630.819
steady distance right that's the idea of

2627.88 --> 2634.42
an orbit but here's the [ __ ] little

2630.819 --> 2638.859
detail that you always Overlook yeah

2634.42 --> 2640.0
if it's at an equilibrium with a poor

2638.859 --> 2642.66
what

2640.0 --> 2648.04
to the other body

2642.66 --> 2652.48
that means there is a pull to the other

2648.04 --> 2655.8
body that is being equilibriated with

2652.48 --> 2659.819
yeah that means

2655.8 --> 2662.92
no zero g there

2659.819 --> 2666.64
[ __ ] did you not think about that

2662.92 --> 2669.64
yeah if it's in an orbit that means it's

2666.64 --> 2674.2
in a pole and is finding an equilibrium

2669.64 --> 2676.48
with that which means there is a pole so

2674.2 --> 2680.819
if you're gonna say the Earth is in

2676.48 --> 2682.5
Orbit of the Sun that means it's in the

2680.819 --> 2687.64
gravitational

2682.5 --> 2692.099
pull of the sun which means things will

2687.64 --> 2694.96
fall towards the sun only being

2692.099 --> 2697.54
equilibriated with

2694.96 --> 2700.9
by the sling motion

2697.54 --> 2703.359
of the Earth which means that as soon as

2700.9 --> 2706.599
you would detach

2703.359 --> 2709.66
yeah detach from Earth

2706.599 --> 2713.56
you would then get stuck in the

2709.66 --> 2715.8999999999996
gravitational pull of the Sun

2713.56 --> 2718.06
logic

2715.9 --> 2720.819
logic

2718.06 --> 2723.66
yeah logic by your own virtual

2720.819 --> 2723.66
mechanisms

2728.8 --> 2734.92
yeah [ __ ] darts [ __ ] retards you're

2732.46 --> 2737.8
all [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah you don't even

2734.92 --> 2741.819
understand your own concept you just

2737.8 --> 2745.54
blabber on some science fiction not even

2741.819 --> 2747.7
realizing the mechanical consequences of

2745.54 --> 2750.88
what they even say is happening in there

2747.7 --> 2754.5989999999997
yeah you don't even think about it ever

2750.88 --> 2758.079
because you're all [ __ ] [ __ ]

2754.599 --> 2761.02
you don't think about the mechanics that

2758.079 --> 2763.48
you swear proves you're right

2761.02 --> 2765.64
because you're [ __ ] idiots

2763.48 --> 2768.339
you don't even think about mechanical

2765.64 --> 2770.74
consequence of the things you believe in

2768.339 --> 2772.9
yeah you [ __ ] not

2770.74 --> 2776.14
you're a dumbass

2772.9 --> 2777.88
you don't understand your own model

2776.14 --> 2780.7
you don't understand

2777.88 --> 2783.6600000000003
that things are not gonna float out

2780.7 --> 2785.5
there in space as soon as you would

2783.66 --> 2788.859
drift off

2785.5 --> 2791.5
from the earth yeah well you might get

2788.859 --> 2794.44
pulled toward the moon or something

2791.5 --> 2796.0
but then yeah very soon after you're

2794.44 --> 2800.579
gonna fall

2796.0 --> 2800.579
you're gonna fall towards the sun baby

2800.619 --> 2805.42
how are you gonna break out of that sun

2803.14 --> 2808.44
fall yeah

2805.42 --> 2808.44
how are you gonna do that

2810.57 --> 2813.8990000000003
[Music]

2816.76 --> 2822.6400000000003
I bet any of the spiritual trajectories

2820.48 --> 2825.88
didn't account for the freaking

2822.64 --> 2829.359
gravitational pull of the Sun that can

2825.88 --> 2831.76
still keep giant bodies and vast faster

2829.359 --> 2833.56
distances for than the earth from the

2831.76 --> 2836.0200000000004
sun allegedly

2833.56 --> 2839.7999999999997
and they're still in the gravitational

2836.02 --> 2842.98
pull in order to be in a gravitational

2839.8 --> 2847.319
or bit yeah that means that all that

2842.98 --> 2852.04
distance the sun is actually pulling

2847.319 --> 2855.22
yeah otherwise what's keeping it there

2852.04 --> 2857.319
I mean it doesn't have to be in the

2855.22 --> 2861.04
gravitational pull than to be in an

2857.319 --> 2863.98
orbit or does it oh all these things all

2861.04 --> 2866.079
mental consequences uh

2863.98 --> 2868.319
you just want to do we just want to see

2866.079 --> 2872.26
the little ball go around the other ball

2868.319 --> 2872.8
we don't want to think about logic

2872.26 --> 2876.3590000000004
right

2872.8 --> 2876.3590000000004
[Music]

2876.64 --> 2880.92
it's all been thought of yeah sure it

2878.74 --> 2880.9199999999996
has

2881.079 --> 2885.96
yes so what did you think of then

2890.319 --> 2896.68
how have you thought of it with by the

2893.68 --> 2898.96
way Newtonian modeling [ __ ] nuts yeah

2896.68 --> 2900.819
it's not even recognized anymore but you

2898.96 --> 2905.859
don't know that you don't know that

2900.819 --> 2908.46
you're a slave to Newtonian mechanics

2905.859 --> 2908.46
foreign

2918.0 --> 2923.579
what are you talking about

2920.56 --> 2923.5789999999997
clap Ruckus

2924.88 --> 2928.2000000000003
Oh you mean akumu

2928.48 --> 2933.819
no he's just blabbering his big ass

2931.24 --> 2936.339
mouth or his ass

2933.819 --> 2938.8
just blabbering his ass

2936.339 --> 2941.7999999999997
trying to act like it's all been figured

2938.8 --> 2943.599
over so smart except he isn't you're not

2941.8 --> 2946.0
that smart and you haven't figured it

2943.599 --> 2949.98
out and your bluff's not working at kumu

2946.0 --> 2949.98
virus you just suck

2952.31 --> 2955.8289999999997
[Music]

2964.52 --> 2967.719
[Music]

2968.74 --> 2974.3799999999997
this is New Year yeah yeah but yet you

2971.44 --> 2976.359
have not actually responded to a single

2974.38 --> 2978.76
in the tail mechanical

2976.359 --> 2980.319
thing that I just discussed all your

2978.76 --> 2983.079
just saying Goods we thought of oh let's

2980.319 --> 2985.599
we figure it out yeah that's what I used

2983.079 --> 2987.7000000000003
to say too as a little kid when I didn't

2985.599 --> 2991.599
know any better

2987.7 --> 2992.7999999999997
dumbass akumu virus yeah you haven't

2991.599 --> 2996.88
actually

2992.8 --> 2999.819
laid it down how yeah or even

2996.88 --> 3003.7400000000002
communicated like the Dilemma that I

2999.819 --> 3008.599
actually mentioned and how that then

3003.74 --> 3008.5989999999997
suddenly solves all these things yeah

3009.24 --> 3014.819
I mean

3011.76 --> 3016.8590000000004
of course right things are in orbit with

3014.819 --> 3018.9
Earth and no it's slightly out of orbit

3016.859 --> 3021.359
that means that you're gonna fall

3018.9 --> 3023.52
towards the sun is that what that means

3021.359 --> 3026.339
that you're suddenly gonna be

3023.52 --> 3028.56
no longer caught

3026.339 --> 3030.66
by the gravitational pull of the earth

3028.56 --> 3033.9
and then that means you're gonna be

3030.66 --> 3036.0
subjected to the stronger Paul that's

3033.9 --> 3039.26
the sun isn't it

3036.0 --> 3039.26
isn't that the Sun

3040.5 --> 3046.94
aren't you gonna fall then towards the

3042.66 --> 3046.94
Sun not in a orbit

3049.5 --> 3052.339
what's gonna happen

3073.92 --> 3078.98
you're always in the pool or something

3075.78 --> 3078.98
yeah but it

3079.2 --> 3083.2799999999997
this is not even really what I'm talking

3082.2 --> 3086.04
about

3083.28 --> 3090.2000000000003
what I'm talking about is that things

3086.04 --> 3090.2
should be Falling Towards the Sun

3091.5 --> 3094.28
all of it

3097.619 --> 3102.42
I mean I technically don't even

3099.66 --> 3104.94
understand how the moon can

3102.42 --> 3108.0
be caught in earth gravitational pull

3104.94 --> 3110.04
yet the Earth is in the sun's

3108.0 --> 3112.02
gravitational pull so why aren't they

3110.04 --> 3113.819
just both in the sun's gravitational

3112.02 --> 3118.04
pull then

3113.819 --> 3118.04
isn't the sun much stronger

3118.74 --> 3126.2
oh oh yeah I'm sure you have a really

3122.339 --> 3126.2
shitty little excuse for that too

3138.599 --> 3144.839
things are fun yeah but the point is if

3141.3 --> 3147.48
it's then not connected in this circular

3144.839 --> 3149.339
motion Falling Towards the Sun and orbit

3147.48 --> 3151.619
which I know that that is exactly what

3149.339 --> 3153.9
that is yeah

3151.619 --> 3156.48
but that means if you're not stuck to

3153.9 --> 3158.88
that orbit then

3156.48 --> 3161.88
you're gonna fall towards the Sun

3158.88 --> 3164.4
like always everything is going to fall

3161.88 --> 3168.059
towards the sun it's like oh

3164.4 --> 3169.8
there's a thing here a meteor where's it

3168.059 --> 3171.8390000000004
going well where do you think it's going

3169.8 --> 3175.819
it's Falling Towards the sun because

3171.839 --> 3175.819
everything falls towards the Sun

3176.04 --> 3180.859
because it's so mighty in its

3177.839 --> 3180.859
gravitation isn't it

3190.92 --> 3195.119
before

3192.42 --> 3196.26
so if you then

3195.119 --> 3199.26
keep

3196.26 --> 3201.0
Earth's gravitation

3199.26 --> 3203.9
that means you're gonna Then Fall

3201.0 --> 3203.9
towards the Sun

3208.559 --> 3211.3390000000004
doesn't it

3220.14 --> 3225.359
I'm I'm really sorry Ballers I'm so

3223.319 --> 3227.7
sorry that I'm raping your mind with

3225.359 --> 3230.46
actual questions about your model that

3227.7 --> 3233.52
you should be thinking about I know

3230.46 --> 3235.8
I just like to rape you with the [ __ ]

3233.52 --> 3238.02
reality of the consequences of your own

3235.8 --> 3241.559
[ __ ] little ideas that you have no

3238.02 --> 3242.7
oversight over yeah just shoving it in

3241.559 --> 3245.7000000000003
your face

3242.7 --> 3247.4399999999996
that's what I like to do

3245.7 --> 3250.319
questions being answered and now there's

3247.44 --> 3252.839
not really being answered you basically

3250.319 --> 3254.64
just confirmed what I said anybody that

3252.839 --> 3257.04
even responded to it

3254.64 --> 3258.96
yeah you just confirmed what I said like

3257.04 --> 3261.42
yeah yeah that indeed means that

3258.96 --> 3266.7200000000003
everything then Falls towards the Sun

3261.42 --> 3266.7200000000003
there's no free floaty space anywhere

3270.359 --> 3274.0789999999997
there should be a pool and everywhere

3272.76 --> 3276.9
that means

3274.079 --> 3280.6800000000003
oh you go out of Earth orbit and then

3276.9 --> 3283.859
you take an object with I don't know

3280.68 --> 3285.839
different densities in there

3283.859 --> 3289.44
and then it's like oh look it's

3285.839 --> 3292.619
arranging look it's now we're detached

3289.44 --> 3295.559
from Earth gravity so now the density

3292.619 --> 3298.619
are aligning in a slightly different way

3295.559 --> 3300.6600000000003
because we're now in the pool of the

3298.619 --> 3304.02
Sun's gravity

3300.66 --> 3307.6189999999997
so then everything should realign in

3304.02 --> 3310.44
according to where the sun is

3307.619 --> 3313.7000000000003
does that happen

3310.44 --> 3313.7000000000003
does that happen

3316.92 --> 3319.52
no

3320.819 --> 3325.64
oh yes akumar says yes

3327.26 --> 3333.42
so so then there is no

3331.02 --> 3334.92
free floaty gravity it just doesn't

3333.42 --> 3338.64
exist then

3334.92 --> 3340.6800000000003
yeah zero g is a myth it's a science

3338.64 --> 3344.0989999999997
fiction myth then it doesn't actually

3340.68 --> 3346.9199999999996
exist because the density alignment

3344.099 --> 3350.119
simply going to adapt to the greatest

3346.92 --> 3350.119
source of gravity

3351.42 --> 3356.16
oh

3352.859 --> 3358.74
it's getting a little bit

3356.16 --> 3360.24
isn't it suddenly after completely

3358.74 --> 3363.4199999999996
rearrange

3360.24 --> 3365.2799999999997
the entire science fiction system that

3363.42 --> 3367.319
you've all been using

3365.28 --> 3370.2000000000003
for like the last hundred years and like

3367.319 --> 3372.34
oh yeah but it was all about the free

3370.2 --> 3373.52
float it is

3372.34 --> 3375.9
[Music]

3373.52 --> 3379.079
yeah yeah but your [ __ ] little

3375.9 --> 3381.92
mechanism make that impossible it

3379.079 --> 3381.92
doesn't work anymore

3383.16 --> 3389.7599999999998
[Music]

3385.76 --> 3392.46
float free like a baby in space I came

3389.76 --> 3396.2400000000002
back in the womb no worries

3392.46 --> 3400.28
accepted super lethal

3396.24 --> 3400.2799999999997
it's a really scary mummy

3401.52 --> 3405.859
this is not a new thing yes

3408.54 --> 3412.5589999999997
[Music]

3410.28 --> 3414.1800000000003
yeah chocolates yeah good to see you by

3412.559 --> 3417.8
the way but I'm gonna just leave that

3414.18 --> 3417.7999999999997
for the Flat Earth debate I'm just

3419.7 --> 3422.8999999999996
[ __ ] around here

3423.24 --> 3426.72
it's trying to make them realize what

3424.92 --> 3429.96
they believe in it's all Newtonian

3426.72 --> 3432.359
thinking and they're still

3429.96 --> 3434.76
they're still not getting the natural

3432.359 --> 3437.72
consequences of the model that they

3434.76 --> 3437.7200000000003
employ

3438.119 --> 3442.559
and I find that hysterical

3440.7 --> 3444.54
like all these things that you've all

3442.559 --> 3449.42
taken for granted like no no that

3444.54 --> 3449.42
doesn't actually work it doesn't work

3449.64 --> 3452.7
it doesn't work

3451.52 --> 3455.28
[Music]

3452.7 --> 3456.96
all this time doesn't work yeah it's not

3455.28 --> 3460.559
happening is it

3456.96 --> 3462.96
I mean anything that I said right here

3460.559 --> 3465.9
today yeah oh the gravity of the sun

3462.96 --> 3470.359
realigning the densities yeah

3465.9 --> 3470.359
so how about that Issa

3470.72 --> 3474.54
free-floating thingies

3472.98 --> 3478.099
how can that work why aren't they

3474.54 --> 3478.099
Falling Towards the Sun

3479.099 --> 3484.1400000000003
did I see your earlier comment

3481.98 --> 3488.18
I think I might have missed it

3484.14 --> 3488.18
what the [ __ ] is this gravity yeah

3488.339 --> 3493.2
the Earth One the custody battle over

3490.859 --> 3495.42
the moon with the sun okay that's a good

3493.2 --> 3498.2599999999998
one that's hilarious

3495.42 --> 3498.26
thank you for that

3498.96 --> 3501.5
foreign

3508.16 --> 3514.5589999999997
look at all the personal taxi they can't

3511.079 --> 3517.26
attack me so they're now nagging the

3514.559 --> 3520.02
fellow chat participants yeah no oh no

3517.26 --> 3522.1800000000003
you can't think this is funny you're

3520.02 --> 3524.839
such a sip

3522.18 --> 3524.839
yeah

3525.0 --> 3528.02
tough isn't it

3538.74 --> 3546.8089999999997
foreign

3540.51 --> 3546.809
[Music]

3568.16 --> 3571.339
it please

3571.559 --> 3576.5
your correction is not making it more

3573.78 --> 3576.5
comprehensible

3583.38 --> 3589.5
there's

3585.54 --> 3592.7599999999998
there's always a point where they are

3589.5 --> 3592.76
in balance

3592.98 --> 3595.7
really

3598.319 --> 3608.7
but what about the pull of the Earth

3603.96 --> 3609.9
while it is spinning in relation to the

3608.7 --> 3613.64
sun

3609.9 --> 3616.98
and then oh if you then find this

3613.64 --> 3620.4
equilibrium point

3616.98 --> 3622.319
yeah in the orbit

3620.4 --> 3625.2000000000003
it's still spinning

3622.319 --> 3630.0
so how is that gonna find an equilibrium

3625.2 --> 3634.64
point with the gravitation of the Sun

3630.0 --> 3639.78
of which the direction is constantly

3634.64 --> 3641.819
changing in relation to you how is that

3639.78 --> 3643.5
finding a balance

3641.819 --> 3646.4
huh

3643.5 --> 3646.4
uh uh

3646.7 --> 3659.5499999999997
thought of that oh [ __ ] oh no

3650.66 --> 3659.5499999999997
[Music]

3663.66 --> 3669.18
they're like orange your point

3667.44 --> 3671.66
that sounds

3669.18 --> 3671.66
French

3672.0 --> 3675.96
so that's that's the point that's just

3673.98 --> 3678.359
gonna describe it's like oh yeah yeah no

3675.96 --> 3680.099
I mean yeah it's constantly this

3678.359 --> 3682.38
gravitational bodies over there and

3680.099 --> 3683.94
there and it's constantly shifting with

3682.38 --> 3687.42
this one but

3683.94 --> 3689.579
at some point there is just a balance

3687.42 --> 3691.619
don't ask me how that's possible with

3689.579 --> 3694.319
all these forces pulling from different

3691.619 --> 3695.579
sides continually changing

3694.319 --> 3699.24
it's just

3695.579 --> 3701.28
it's just in Balance I mean don't expect

3699.24 --> 3704.5789999999997
me to actually explain how that's

3701.28 --> 3706.559
happening it's just happening

3704.579 --> 3708.8390000000004
it's just orbital mechanics it just

3706.559 --> 3710.4
works yeah yeah stop pestering me with

3708.839 --> 3712.5589999999997
trying to explain how that mechanically

3710.4 --> 3716.4
works because you can't you just have to

3712.559 --> 3718.38
believe me on it just works huh yeah

3716.4 --> 3721.02
yeah

3718.38 --> 3723.059
I'm appealing for a job at Nasa because

3721.02 --> 3726.42
I have the right attitude

3723.059 --> 3728.88
just don't be whiny we got a reference

3726.42 --> 3732.1800000000003
yeah we gotta reference somebody with a

3728.88 --> 3734.339
very French name figured it out a

3732.18 --> 3736.859
hundred years ago oh he didn't actually

3734.339 --> 3739.2599999999998
explain how that mechanically works but

3736.859 --> 3741.66
he figured it out and we all trust him

3739.26 --> 3743.099
and so should you if you know what's

3741.66 --> 3744.359
good for you

3743.099 --> 3746.28
huh

3744.359 --> 3747.299
you don't want to be a flat earther do

3746.28 --> 3749.94
you

3747.299 --> 3751.619
no it works because we got a name for it

3749.94 --> 3754.02
somebody figured it out he didn't

3751.619 --> 3756.059
explain how it works but he figured out

3754.02 --> 3756.96
that it worked and we just have to trust

3756.059 --> 3759.059
it

3756.96 --> 3763.64
yes

3759.059 --> 3763.6400000000003
yes that's how we do things here

3771.24 --> 3774.3799999999997
look at this guy

3787.26 --> 3790.8190000000004
into adjust your position

3794.579 --> 3799.079
okay

3796.14 --> 3800.819
thank you Aries thank you for clarifying

3799.079 --> 3803.88
my point

3800.819 --> 3806.7
that there is no zero g

3803.88 --> 3811.03
and that you would constantly have to

3806.7 --> 3813.97
adjust your position to keep balance

3811.03 --> 3816.989
[Laughter]

3813.97 --> 3816.9889999999996
[Music]

3820.339 --> 3825.319
oh my God I'm loving it

3826.079 --> 3832.6400000000003
oh

3828.48 --> 3832.64
it is good to be a flat earther guys

3852.9 --> 3858.839
isn't it just lovely

3856.14 --> 3860.819
all these mechanics oh they taken it

3858.839 --> 3863.04
into account for yeah yeah look this guy

3860.819 --> 3865.74
he just proved that because of the

3863.04 --> 3867.599
shifting gravitational points there is

3865.74 --> 3870.1189999999997
like a constant unbalance you have to

3867.599 --> 3872.94
constantly shift to keep your correction

3870.119 --> 3876.9
so you have the right balance

3872.94 --> 3879.059
oh oh yeah yeah there's this thing go

3876.9 --> 3880.2000000000003
you know the science fiction industry

3879.059 --> 3883.8590000000004
and

3880.2 --> 3887.16
they don't actually apply that though

3883.859 --> 3890.46
you know it's really annoying it's kind

3887.16 --> 3893.339
of like it's too difficult and

3890.46 --> 3895.5
it makes things not go smooth

3893.339 --> 3897.18
so they don't really apply it you know

3895.5 --> 3899.16
and that's why nobody knows about it

3897.18 --> 3901.3799999999997
until somebody like me comes along and

3899.16 --> 3903.54
starts to point at how ridiculous this

3901.38 --> 3906.359
entire setup is and then you quickly

3903.54 --> 3908.4
Google it and you find it like oh see

3906.359 --> 3910.2
this guy yeah he figured it out he

3908.4 --> 3912.059
figured out exactly how it is constantly

3910.2 --> 3914.819
an imbalance so you have to re-change

3912.059 --> 3919.0400000000004
your position to keep that balance

3914.819 --> 3920.819
unlike what we actually do

3919.04 --> 3921.48
hmm

3920.819 --> 3923.7599999999998
um

3921.48 --> 3925.36
yes

3923.76 --> 3932.55
how peculiar

3925.36 --> 3932.55
[Music]

3933.619 --> 3936.859
yeah right

3940.02 --> 3944.54
keep telling yourself that dude

3961.02 --> 3965.46
three body prop yeah I was taking Star

3962.819 --> 3967.38
Wars don't even bring in like space-time

3965.46 --> 3970.099
bending I wasn't even

3967.38 --> 3970.099
dude

3971.64 --> 3977.819
let me just tear it down through the

3974.819 --> 3979.5589999999997
Newtonian mechanical Vision which is the

3977.819 --> 3981.96
real thing that people believe in

3979.559 --> 3984.299
whether they realize it or not I'm just

3981.96 --> 3987.18
going through Newtonian mechanics here

3984.299 --> 3989.28
yeah which is the real guiding system

3987.18 --> 3991.2
for the whole thing

3989.28 --> 3994.88
not Einstein gravity because it doesn't

3991.2 --> 3994.8799999999997
actually tell you anything

3996.539 --> 4002.98
doesn't tell you how things are even

3998.4 --> 4002.98
supposed to work it's ridiculous right

4003.26 --> 4008.1400000000003
but it's so funny that even within the

4005.96 --> 4010.2200000000003
Newtonian mechanics there's so many

4008.14 --> 4013.24
errors and

4010.22 --> 4017.72
breaches and impossible to overcome

4013.24 --> 4020.299
situations that are just ignored they're

4017.72 --> 4023.48
just ignored

4020.299 --> 4025.22
yeah it only comes up if somebody asks a

4023.48 --> 4027.079
difficult question like how is that all

4025.22 --> 4029.359
supposed to fit all the forces it's like

4027.079 --> 4032.8390000000004
oh no there's this LaGrange thing this

4029.359 --> 4034.16
person the gosh he figured it out that

4032.839 --> 4035.48
it's just like you have to constantly

4034.16 --> 4038.42
correct and this and that and it's

4035.48 --> 4041.299
really complicated that and that's why

4038.42 --> 4043.52
we don't apply that because it's too

4041.299 --> 4046.22
complicated and it's annoying and it

4043.52 --> 4048.74
makes things too difficult if you would

4046.22 --> 4052.4599999999996
assume that was real so

4048.74 --> 4054.3799999999997
we have it there just just for at reach

4052.46 --> 4056.2400000000002
as soon as somebody asks a complicated

4054.38 --> 4057.98
question about how is this mechanically

4056.24 --> 4061.0989999999997
supposed to work

4057.98 --> 4062.9
but you don't actually apply that

4061.099 --> 4065.839
constantly

4062.9 --> 4068.059
because it's just too difficult and

4065.839 --> 4071.359
there's even kind of this dispute about

4068.059 --> 4074.3590000000004
what is gravity and yeah you know we

4071.359 --> 4076.16
don't need to really apply lagrange's

4074.359 --> 4079.16
system

4076.16 --> 4080.96
because I mean Newtonian gravity isn't

4079.16 --> 4083.0
even that's not even the thing anymore

4080.96 --> 4085.579
supposedly we don't have anything to

4083.0 --> 4088.099
replace it with mind you but it's not

4085.579 --> 4090.6800000000003
official anymore so we don't re we can

4088.099 --> 4093.26
just like take out of the Newtonian

4090.68 --> 4095.72
mechanics whatever we want you know it's

4093.26 --> 4099.62
very convenient that way we don't have

4095.72 --> 4102.199
to actually be consistent or anything

4099.62 --> 4105.3189999999995
right you can just do whatever we want

4102.199 --> 4107.24
with it a nice little sandbox playing

4105.319 --> 4115.68
Ground

4107.24 --> 4115.679999999999
[Music]

4119.54 --> 4125.66
it's too complicated so it's not real

4123.02 --> 4128.6
no no that's not what I said [ __ ]

4125.66 --> 4133.339
Aries 106 what I said is it's too

4128.6 --> 4136.759
complicated it's not applied

4133.339 --> 4139.1
it's not applied

4136.759 --> 4143.259
not applied

4139.1 --> 4143.259
not actually used

4143.9 --> 4151.4
don't straw madney yeah

4147.62 --> 4154.58
don't re-arrange the words that come out

4151.4 --> 4160.12
of my mouth so they can get inside of

4154.58 --> 4160.12
your head in a more convenient way yeah

4160.339 --> 4166.8189999999995
I didn't say it's too complicated it's

4163.58 --> 4171.199
not real no I said it's too complicated

4166.819 --> 4171.1990000000005
it's not applied

4176.6 --> 4178.660000000001
oh

4178.759 --> 4181.719
foreign

4183.66 --> 4189.429
[Music]

4211.48 --> 4218.9
from chaos that's how it works

4215.66 --> 4221.42
right it's reversed entropy

4218.9 --> 4223.4
that's literally what they claim for

4221.42 --> 4224.3
that to happen reversed entropy is the

4223.4 --> 4228.259999999999
only way

4224.3 --> 4232.28
things can go from Total disorder like

4228.26 --> 4237.679
materially unbonded substance

4232.28 --> 4242.0
to rapidly explode into order into ever

4237.679 --> 4242.0
increasing order stability

4242.12 --> 4248.0599999999995
Into A Clockwork

4244.699 --> 4251.0599999999995
now of course nothing that has ever been

4248.06 --> 4254.360000000001
done will ever demonstrate that but

4251.06 --> 4256.159000000001
if you did the opposite you made

4254.36 --> 4259.46
something orderly

4256.159 --> 4261.98
and then you blow it up

4259.46 --> 4263.659
and then you film that and then put it

4261.98 --> 4266.239
in reverse

4263.659 --> 4267.86
well then you sort of have the big bang

4266.239 --> 4270.678999999999
don't you

4267.86 --> 4272.179
kind of is like that isn't it

4270.679 --> 4273.92
right

4272.179 --> 4276.08
I mean

4273.92 --> 4279.5
so it's just like yeah it's just

4276.08 --> 4282.32
reversed entropy I mean it's only like

4279.5 --> 4286.52
the one logically consistent ultimate

4282.32 --> 4288.739
thing that determines what reality is

4286.52 --> 4292.040000000001
you just have to reverse that and then

4288.739 --> 4293.659
it all makes sense right that's all I

4292.04 --> 4295.88
mean what's the problem here

4293.659 --> 4298.46
just have to reverse the like the

4295.88 --> 4300.5
foundational Stone of everything that

4298.46 --> 4302.719
makes everything the way it is and and

4300.5 --> 4305.12
then it works

4302.719 --> 4306.679
it's very easy you just have to flip

4305.12 --> 4311.08
around

4306.679 --> 4311.08
entire reality and then it works

4351.62 --> 4355.099999999999
can you believe that I kicked him out

4354.26 --> 4358.52
but

4355.1 --> 4361.52
somebody comes in here and says

4358.52 --> 4364.400000000001
I've been watching you say the same

4361.52 --> 4365.84
thing for four years that's his

4364.4 --> 4369.92
complaint

4365.84 --> 4372.679
so this guy watched me for four years

4369.92 --> 4374.54
and he's coming just to tell me that

4372.679 --> 4377.4800000000005
he's complaining about

4374.54 --> 4380.36
how it's always the same

4377.48 --> 4383.12
but why are you actually watching me for

4380.36 --> 4384.679
four years then why why are you doing

4383.12 --> 4387.219
that to yourself if you think it's

4384.679 --> 4391.3
everything I say is wrong

4387.219 --> 4391.3
what the hell are you doing here

4397.34 --> 4402.679
I mean why don't you just go to like

4400.04 --> 4405.5
fight the Flat Earth or Mr sensible I

4402.679 --> 4407.719
mean they they say it right I mean

4405.5 --> 4410.36
they they're telling you what you want

4407.719 --> 4412.64
to hear don't they

4410.36 --> 4415.04
I mean yes you're gonna turn into a

4412.64 --> 4416.900000000001
complete piece of [ __ ] gamma if you just

4415.04 --> 4421.5199999999995
listen long enough to them

4416.9 --> 4424.159
but I mean that's worth it right

4421.52 --> 4427.040000000001
or or did you think that you could like

4424.159 --> 4432.139999999999
get a little bit of this arwenian energy

4427.04 --> 4435.5
and drive but like without the Flat

4432.14 --> 4438.280000000001
Earth part huh what just you think you

4435.5 --> 4441.38
can steal the power of Flat Earth

4438.28 --> 4443.0599999999995
without flat Earth just just the power

4441.38 --> 4446.36
not the flatter do you think you could

4443.06 --> 4449.120000000001
just do that think that works

4446.36 --> 4451.659
how do you think I got this power

4449.12 --> 4451.659
foreign

4455.14 --> 4461.12
about the consensus of a bunch of

4458.12 --> 4463.4
[ __ ] slavish retards that don't even

4461.12 --> 4465.62
understand what they believe in

4463.4 --> 4468.139999999999
yeah and then you get all this freedom

4465.62 --> 4470.0
and energy and it's amazing

4468.14 --> 4472.52
yeah there's some isolation but it's

4470.0 --> 4475.64
great it's very well worth it

4472.52 --> 4478.400000000001
because I mean the other choice for me

4475.64 --> 4483.219
is I become just a piece of [ __ ] like

4478.4 --> 4483.219
everybody else disgusting [ __ ]

4483.38 --> 4488.0
that'll literally get themselves killed

4485.9 --> 4489.5
because they're too [ __ ] trusting and

4488.0 --> 4491.239
[ __ ]

4489.5 --> 4495.26
yeah

4491.239 --> 4497.54
and then I thought no I hate that I hate

4495.26 --> 4499.34
that about this world and I'm not gonna

4497.54 --> 4502.34
become that

4499.34 --> 4506.12
even if that makes my life a living hell

4502.34 --> 4509.42
the rest of my life I'd rather live in a

4506.12 --> 4512.239
living hell than to become a [ __ ]

4509.42 --> 4516.52
[ __ ] that would get themselves killed

4512.239 --> 4516.5199999999995
because of their own deranged delusions

4517.76 --> 4524.900000000001
yeah not get killed by somebody else get

4521.659 --> 4529.46
killed by themselves

4524.9 --> 4533.12
by trusting the science and listening to

4529.46 --> 4535.28
what freaking evil satanic people tell

4533.12 --> 4537.5599999999995
them to do

4535.28 --> 4541.34
yeah that's how you get killed in this

4537.56 --> 4544.34
world being a complacent [ __ ]

4541.34 --> 4545.54
or I'd rather live in hell the rest of

4544.34 --> 4548.8
my life

4545.54 --> 4548.8
than to be that

4549.44 --> 4553.639999999999
yeah and that includes dealing with the

4552.5 --> 4556.34
people

4553.64 --> 4558.9800000000005
that don't do that and that brace

4556.34 --> 4561.9800000000005
against that that will fight to be a

4558.98 --> 4563.718999999999
sheep yeah get them in my chat here

4561.98 --> 4566.36
every day

4563.719 --> 4568.4
it's all part of it I'm getting used to

4566.36 --> 4571.099999999999
it

4568.4 --> 4573.32
it's not less agitating I mean I'm still

4571.1 --> 4576.02
going to figure out how to exact

4573.32 --> 4579.799999999999
vengeance

4576.02 --> 4581.0
on a visceral personal level to their

4579.8 --> 4584.2390000000005
lives

4581.0 --> 4586.219
because if you behave that way you gotta

4584.239 --> 4588.62
pay

4586.219 --> 4591.26
I'm not talking about getting banned in

4588.62 --> 4594.199
my chat I'm talking in your [ __ ]

4591.26 --> 4596.06
little life you [ __ ] you think it's

4594.199 --> 4598.54
okay to behave like that you're gonna

4596.06 --> 4598.54
pay

4602.05 --> 4607.979
[Music]

4611.04 --> 4614.489
[Music]

4615.14 --> 4620.42
foreign

4617.29 --> 4620.42
[Music]

4621.159 --> 4626.96
anyway let's get back

4623.659 --> 4631.12
to gravity retardation

4626.96 --> 4631.12
huh thing that started it all

4632.42 --> 4637.46
make everybody squirt in chat

4635.36 --> 4640.339999999999
all these ballers

4637.46 --> 4644.02
desperately trying to Virtue signal

4640.34 --> 4644.02
their way back into dementia

4649.46 --> 4656.9
yeah there is no orbit

4651.98 --> 4661.36
there's no falling around something

4656.9 --> 4661.36
what a ridiculous concept

4664.46 --> 4669.32
so

4666.32 --> 4672.44
in that ridiculous conception

4669.32 --> 4674.239
you get outside of the pool of the

4672.44 --> 4676.759999999999
nearest big body

4674.239 --> 4678.62
the gravitational pull that means that

4676.76 --> 4681.7390000000005
you're then immediately going to be

4678.62 --> 4685.159
subjected to the next best pull

4681.739 --> 4686.36
available which would probably be the

4685.159 --> 4689.239
bigger body

4686.36 --> 4690.739
that keeps the large body that we had

4689.239 --> 4693.5599999999995
you in its pool

4690.739 --> 4695.86
in its pool so that's then gonna pull

4693.56 --> 4695.860000000001
you

4696.92 --> 4701.179
and like quite

4698.9 --> 4705.139999999999
quickly

4701.179 --> 4706.6990000000005
like palpably it's like oh I feel the

4705.14 --> 4708.679
Gravity from Earth and then you go up

4706.699 --> 4711.0199999999995
and it's like oh maybe maybe it's

4708.679 --> 4713.42
getting less probably not

4711.02 --> 4715.820000000001
then at some point it's going to be like

4713.42 --> 4719.54
oh hey whoa

4715.82 --> 4722.96
and you literally kind of fall at the

4719.54 --> 4725.659
ceiling and guess what now it's Falling

4722.96 --> 4728.96
Towards the Sun

4725.659 --> 4731.48
yeah in that ship whenever that is

4728.96 --> 4733.04
that's what should be happening

4731.48 --> 4738.0199999999995
yeah

4733.04 --> 4741.56
you go beyond the orbit Point vertical

4738.02 --> 4743.42
or equilibrium somehow

4741.56 --> 4745.219
yeah

4743.42 --> 4748.28
well that means that you're then going

4745.219 --> 4749.6
to be immediately subjected to the next

4748.28 --> 4752.0599999999995
best pool

4749.6 --> 4755.54
which would be the sun which would

4752.06 --> 4758.6
literally make everything fall towards

4755.54 --> 4761.26
that including you in your alleged

4758.6 --> 4761.26
spaceship

4762.199 --> 4766.759999999999
right it's just gonna be like oh yeah

4764.42 --> 4769.219
instead of like we're not

4766.76 --> 4771.8
being pulled towards the Earth trying to

4769.219 --> 4774.199
make keep our Heights no and then sadly

4771.8 --> 4776.42
boom it's around certainly this yeah

4774.199 --> 4779.239
this Earth is over there and now you're

4776.42 --> 4782.9
Falling Towards that sun in a super far

4779.239 --> 4785.48
distance so it's literally like

4782.9 --> 4787.879999999999
and everything is going to be equally

4785.48 --> 4789.5
pulled towards that that's what would

4787.88 --> 4793.179
happen

4789.5 --> 4793.179
if any of that was real

4794.06 --> 4799.0
really makes words interesting relative

4796.34 --> 4799.0
densities

4799.16 --> 4802.3589999999995
[Music]

4807.92 --> 4812.719
no it doesn't

4810.44 --> 4816.919999999999
everything that I talked about right now

4812.719 --> 4821.92
is pure Fiction it's all part of the

4816.92 --> 4821.92
Newtonian mechanics science fiction

4822.199 --> 4828.86
yeah the science fiction of heliocentric

4825.08 --> 4829.94
outer space and gravitational pulls

4828.86 --> 4832.699
yeah

4829.94 --> 4835.04
nothing about that has anything to do

4832.699 --> 4837.379999999999
with what actually happens here on Earth

4835.04 --> 4839.719
in our Realm

4837.38 --> 4843.26
when you want to get real with it

4839.719 --> 4846.159
relative density this equilibrium force

4843.26 --> 4850.12
is exactly what's happening

4846.159 --> 4850.12
scientifically provable

4850.52 --> 4859.1
yeah gravity is as fictional construct

4854.42 --> 4862.46
Newton the man who invented that gravity

4859.1 --> 4865.900000000001
model that you desperately apply in your

4862.46 --> 4870.02
mind in your science fiction world

4865.9 --> 4875.179
specifically in an official letter with

4870.02 --> 4877.88
disdain said how he did not abide by the

4875.179 --> 4880.159
notion that gravitation would be

4877.88 --> 4882.92
scientifically legitimate he thought

4880.159 --> 4887.239
that was outrageous yeah

4882.92 --> 4889.9
the man who invented the thing that you

4887.239 --> 4889.9
believe in

4889.94 --> 4897.199
he ridiculed it because he thought it

4893.42 --> 4900.14
was ridiculous yet you believe in it

4897.199 --> 4901.759999999999
you apply it to everything that you

4900.14 --> 4904.84
believe in

4901.76 --> 4904.84
still you do

4917.42 --> 4921.1
AP degree Christian good to see you

4921.199 --> 4926.54
yeah today's been quite a blast

4924.38 --> 4930.52
[Music]

4926.54 --> 4930.5199999999995
the trolls lots of triggering

4931.1 --> 4936.280000000001
kumu virus is still in here because he

4933.56 --> 4936.280000000001
took my advice

4936.8 --> 4943.04
very wise of you I don't want to kick

4939.56 --> 4946.1
you out you see but I definitely never

4943.04 --> 4949.159
want to hear you say

4946.1 --> 4952.52
it's really simple

4949.159 --> 4955.46
as a response to an inquiry

4952.52 --> 4957.64
you either say it or you shut the [ __ ]

4955.46 --> 4957.64
up

4959.78 --> 4966.5
yeah you say the answer you give a

4963.08 --> 4969.199
response you lay it down no more

4966.5 --> 4971.6
covering it up with always yeah it's

4969.199 --> 4973.159
really simple no more I don't want to

4971.6 --> 4976.52
see you do that anymore

4973.159 --> 4980.08
you either give an in content response

4976.52 --> 4980.080000000001
or you shut the [ __ ] up

4981.199 --> 4986.199
no more superiority gaslighting you hear

4986.65 --> 4990.25
[Music]

4992.9 --> 4996.5599999999995
do you know Newton was in our cult stuff

4995.12 --> 5000.719
too yeah

4996.56 --> 5000.719
Newton is a very interesting guy

5000.73 --> 5003.87
[Music]

5010.42 --> 5017.56
on his work on Optics

5014.02 --> 5020.5
and race of math astounding well

5017.56 --> 5022.780000000001
he made people think I mean

5020.5 --> 5024.52
the basic Newtonian mechanics which

5022.78 --> 5028.12
apply to

5024.52 --> 5031.780000000001
solids and liquids yeah it's interesting

5028.12 --> 5033.159
it makes you think it's like this Legos

5031.78 --> 5036.159
that is

5033.159 --> 5039.04
like easy to help you figure out like

5036.159 --> 5041.679
basic mechanics right the thing is

5039.04 --> 5044.5
though it does not a bike for gas laws

5041.679 --> 5047.5
at all it doesn't abide to like any kind

5044.5 --> 5050.8
of gas mechanics so it's incomplete it

5047.5 --> 5053.86
it really is just like Legos it's a play

5050.8 --> 5055.12
thing it's not the real thing it's a

5053.86 --> 5058.42
play thing

5055.12 --> 5060.64
to kind of get a grip on basic mechanics

5058.42 --> 5061.96
and it's pretty good I think Newton

5060.64 --> 5063.820000000001
really

5061.96 --> 5067.02
did a good thing

5063.82 --> 5070.0
with that it's just that

5067.02 --> 5073.42
Society basically raped him

5070.0 --> 5074.62
raped his legacy and turned it into this

5073.42 --> 5077.32
insane

5074.62 --> 5079.57
science fiction system that he didn't

5077.32 --> 5094.049
approve of obviously

5079.57 --> 5094.049
[Music]

5104.5 --> 5107.159

5204.699 --> 5211.12
uh I don't know if you caught that last

5207.76 --> 5215.58
part saying that Nathan is late

5211.12 --> 5215.58
so either but he's just late

5215.86 --> 5219.9
or there might not be a live fed

5228.46 --> 5234.36
what

5229.8 --> 5234.360000000001
no or not go one more year behind

5253.84 --> 5256.32
all right

5259.62 --> 5264.58
anyway yeah I feel like I'm done with

5263.32 --> 5267.239
this rant

5264.58 --> 5271.98
I made enough points

5267.239 --> 5271.98
what a great laugh that was awesome

5275.139 --> 5278.639
it was good to have a day off

5288.94 --> 5291.78
foreign

5292.62 --> 5299.5599999999995
get so much faster if everything came

5295.719 --> 5302.56
from the same ex down psych there

5299.56 --> 5305.04
what kind of a question is that

5302.56 --> 5308.5
can't expect him to answer that dude

5305.04 --> 5310.54
Mercury can't even be modeled using

5308.5 --> 5312.88
Newtonian mechanics

5310.54 --> 5314.739
did you forget that

5312.88 --> 5317.38
maybe you weren't around when it was

5314.739 --> 5320.08
making that an item on my show like a

5317.38 --> 5322.06
year ago I think two years maybe

5320.08 --> 5325.239
but yeah

5322.06 --> 5328.2390000000005
I don't know anybody here remembers

5325.239 --> 5332.62
but there's this thing about the orbit

5328.239 --> 5337.0
of mercury in our solar system

5332.62 --> 5339.46
you see the solar system I was made to

5337.0 --> 5341.139
work is based on Newtonian mechanics

5339.46 --> 5343.12
because that's literally the only

5341.139 --> 5344.26
mechanics you can actually do anything

5343.12 --> 5348.46
with

5344.26 --> 5349.6
if you want to have more than two bodies

5348.46 --> 5351.88
yeah

5349.6 --> 5353.860000000001
of Attraction so that's how the

5351.88 --> 5355.12
heliocentric

5353.86 --> 5357.159
yeah

5355.12 --> 5359.5
solar system

5357.159 --> 5361.78
was made

5359.5 --> 5365.58
using Newtonian mechanics and then the

5361.78 --> 5365.58
orbits and then it all kind of works

5365.62 --> 5371.219
for mercury

5367.84 --> 5374.8
like Mercury does not work at all

5371.219 --> 5377.92
according to Newtonian mechanics Mercury

5374.8 --> 5382.08
should be gone it should be absorbed by

5377.92 --> 5382.08
the Sun a long long time ago

5382.179 --> 5390.04
now how did they

5384.94 --> 5391.659
like fix this problem you say you ask

5390.04 --> 5393.28
well

5391.659 --> 5395.32
they cheated

5393.28 --> 5397.659
he see what they did

5395.32 --> 5399.94
is they took the entire solar system

5397.659 --> 5402.4
using Newtonian mechanics so you

5399.94 --> 5405.0599999999995
completed it like oh it's working just

5402.4 --> 5405.0599999999995
not Mercury

5405.159 --> 5412.179
and then

5407.02 --> 5414.84
they added Mercury orbit using Einstein

5412.179 --> 5414.84
mechanics

5415.42 --> 5419.88
yep

5417.1 --> 5424.5
they literally like

5419.88 --> 5424.5
frankensteined up the solar system

5425.5 --> 5432.34
they just couldn't get that mercury in

5428.5 --> 5435.6
there so they just added it using

5432.34 --> 5438.28
another system that's not compatible

5435.6 --> 5442.02
afterward it's like an artistic

5438.28 --> 5445.96
insertion Mercury is artistically

5442.02 --> 5448.96
inserted it's orbit in between the

5445.96 --> 5450.34
perfectly balanced Newtonian solar

5448.96 --> 5453.1
system

5450.34 --> 5455.38
isn't that just fascinating

5453.1 --> 5457.780000000001
right and I'm not making this up this is

5455.38 --> 5462.52
official

5457.78 --> 5465.639
isn't that just incredibly fascinating

5462.52 --> 5467.56
just that history they made the solar

5465.639 --> 5470.08
system using Newtonian mechanics it

5467.56 --> 5472.42
worked perfectly it's just like wow how

5470.08 --> 5475.48
is this working it's working oh wait

5472.42 --> 5477.88
what's Happening Here Mercury ah why

5475.48 --> 5481.239
can't we get Mercury to work damn it

5477.88 --> 5487.12
why won't it just stay out of the Sun

5481.239 --> 5489.28
uh okay uh well Mercury is there so we

5487.12 --> 5491.199
might just as well then artistically

5489.28 --> 5493.9
insert it and then we'll just kind of

5491.199 --> 5496.44
like make it work using einsteining

5493.9 --> 5496.44
mechanics

5496.719 --> 5502.06
even though it's not compatible

5498.94 --> 5504.699
and they didn't then also apply the

5502.06 --> 5506.38
Einstein mechanics to the rest

5504.699 --> 5509.199
yeah they didn't actually do that

5506.38 --> 5512.4400000000005
because it doesn't work

5509.199 --> 5515.62
so it's a Newtonian solar system

5512.44 --> 5519.219
except for mercury which is like

5515.62 --> 5521.639
artistically added on top using Einstein

5519.219 --> 5521.639
mechanics

5522.159 --> 5525.599999999999
isn't that just amazing

5525.76 --> 5531.219
that's what we use today that's

5528.58 --> 5533.86
literally every time you see any kind of

5531.219 --> 5537.82
rendering of a model of the heliocentric

5533.86 --> 5539.5599999999995
system or an animation representation

5537.82 --> 5542.62
that's what it is

5539.56 --> 5545.26
that's what what it actually is

5542.62 --> 5548.38
it's a Newtonian system

5545.26 --> 5550.9800000000005
perfectly balance it it works it

5548.38 --> 5554.38
actually does work within that system

5550.98 --> 5557.58
except for mercury they could never get

5554.38 --> 5560.1
it to work never never never

5557.58 --> 5564.1
they can't get it to work so it's just

5560.1 --> 5566.9400000000005
artistically added in afterward using

5564.1 --> 5571.84
some different paints

5566.94 --> 5574.9
Einstein paint on the Newtonian painting

5571.84 --> 5577.42
yeah that's what you get now every time

5574.9 --> 5578.799999999999
you see that that's what that is that's

5577.42 --> 5582.06
what you're looking at right there

5578.8 --> 5582.06
that's the formula

5582.159 --> 5587.739
yeah

5583.42 --> 5589.96
cannot be helped this is officially true

5587.739 --> 5592.48
this is official

5589.96 --> 5593.7390000000005
this is historical that that is what is

5592.48 --> 5595.54
going on

5593.739 --> 5598.178999999999
what are you gonna do about it ball

5595.54 --> 5599.56
believer how are you gonna Rectify that

5598.179 --> 5602.56
in your mind are you gonna go to fight

5599.56 --> 5605.860000000001
the Flat Earth on us and say uh

5602.56 --> 5608.8
it's just Newtonian gravity is emergent

5605.86 --> 5610.599999999999
force from the space-time bending and

5608.8 --> 5611.9800000000005
that's how it works even though it

5610.6 --> 5615.46
doesn't work and it's not actually

5611.98 --> 5618.5199999999995
compatible mathematically at all

5615.46 --> 5621.159
but so it's just not fixing it's just a

5618.52 --> 5623.1990000000005
blabbermouth excuse to kind of dump on

5621.159 --> 5626.44
top of it like a cloth that kind of hide

5623.199 --> 5630.419999999999
it all right it's compatible don't don't

5626.44 --> 5630.419999999999
don't look at it it's compatible because

5631.96 --> 5636.2300000000005
it's compatible

5634.36 --> 5641.139
somehow

5636.23 --> 5645.28
[Music]

5641.139 --> 5649.36
Mercury can be seen oh my God how dare I

5645.28 --> 5652.719
guys look at that look at see

5649.36 --> 5655.599999999999
everything I've said they've interpreted

5652.719 --> 5657.82
the the numpty [ __ ] ballers in chat

5655.6 --> 5661.0
that feel really triggered

5657.82 --> 5664.98
they've interpreted what I said two of

5661.0 --> 5669.239
them Mercury is observed not invented

5664.98 --> 5671.138999999999
Mercury can be seen it's real

5669.239 --> 5673.36
ah

5671.139 --> 5675.58
did I say

5673.36 --> 5678.94
it's not Observer

5675.58 --> 5681.42
did I say it's not real

5678.94 --> 5681.419999999999
no

5681.639 --> 5689.46
I said look at the model look at the

5686.86 --> 5691.96
model of the solar system yeah

5689.46 --> 5696.28
heliocentric model

5691.96 --> 5697.659
based on Newtonian mechanics officially

5696.28 --> 5700.719
yeah

5697.659 --> 5704.099999999999
oh Mercury is there too yeah oh but it's

5700.719 --> 5706.96
not Newtonian Mercury because that one

5704.1 --> 5709.0
immediately falls into the sun

5706.96 --> 5710.199
it can't work

5709.0 --> 5713.62
yeah

5710.199 --> 5717.219
yeah I'm not saying you can't see

5713.62 --> 5720.94
mercury in the sky sometimes

5717.219 --> 5722.9800000000005
I'm not saying Mercury doesn't exist I

5720.94 --> 5726.58
mean it is a light in the sky

5722.98 --> 5729.48
I'm just saying that you're a nice cozy

5726.58 --> 5731.739
little reliable

5729.48 --> 5735.5199999999995
heliocentric model

5731.739 --> 5738.28
is based on Newtonian mechanics except

5735.52 --> 5740.02
for mercury it's einsteining mechanics

5738.28 --> 5742.54
because they can't get it to be

5740.02 --> 5744.040000000001
Newtonian in that model and not fall

5742.54 --> 5748.06
into the sun

5744.04 --> 5750.76
yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm I'm telling

5748.06 --> 5753.34
you the truth this is historical this is

5750.76 --> 5756.219
fact you can literally

5753.34 --> 5757.06
go into the history of it back engineer

5756.219 --> 5760.2390000000005
it

5757.06 --> 5763.84
maybe even find testimony of the people

5760.239 --> 5767.379999999999
that assembled it at the time

5763.84 --> 5772.360000000001
and see that I'm speaking the truth

5767.38 --> 5775.32
this is what is real this is official

5772.36 --> 5775.32
ah

5775.78 --> 5780.82
oh it doesn't doesn't fit so well in

5778.719 --> 5783.179
your head now anymore does it's not so

5780.82 --> 5786.639
smooth and easy yeah yeah I know

5783.179 --> 5789.46
ignorance makes the heliocentric model

5786.639 --> 5791.679
work so well just don't think too

5789.46 --> 5794.7390000000005
carefully about just enjoy the beautiful

5791.679 --> 5798.4
pictures and then amazing little

5794.739 --> 5800.44
hugeness and oh it's so awesome so big

5798.4 --> 5802.599999999999
and Fantastical yeah don't think about

5800.44 --> 5805.48
the details or how it's supposed to work

5802.6 --> 5808.0
because if you do that you're gonna

5805.48 --> 5810.159
stumble upon the history how it was

5808.0 --> 5813.42
actually established and then you're

5810.159 --> 5815.62
gonna find out a very few curious things

5813.42 --> 5817.9
like I have

5815.62 --> 5820.36
yeah like what I've been explaining in

5817.9 --> 5822.4
the last 10 minutes

5820.36 --> 5825.82
yeah

5822.4 --> 5829.259999999999
it's the truth it's historical fact

5825.82 --> 5829.259999999999
what are you gonna do about it

5829.5 --> 5833.38
how are you gonna make it work in your

5832.3 --> 5835.84
head now

5833.38 --> 5838.900000000001
now that you actually know

5835.84 --> 5840.88
historical facts about that model do you

5838.9 --> 5844.5
believe in huh

5840.88 --> 5844.5
how's it going to fit in your head now

5845.86 --> 5848.32
oh

5847.239 --> 5851.218999999999
uh

5848.32 --> 5851.219
uh uh

5851.56 --> 5858.46
maybe Chan for me some more

5854.32 --> 5861.46
maybe if you just said Mercury is real

5858.46 --> 5865.54
some more times than maybe that will fix

5861.46 --> 5868.139
this historically recognized problem

5865.54 --> 5868.139
huh

5872.41 --> 5875.55
[Music]

5878.11 --> 5889.36
[Music]

5886.8 --> 5890.52
hilarious I'm getting confirmation here

5889.36 --> 5893.679
good

5890.52 --> 5896.139
hypothesis for the cause was wrong yeah

5893.679 --> 5898.179
except Newtonian mechanics is the only

5896.139 --> 5901.179
thing that you're still using to

5898.179 --> 5904.6
actually establish the solar system

5901.179 --> 5906.88
there's no other mechanic system that

5904.6 --> 5911.4400000000005
does that now is it

5906.88 --> 5914.1990000000005
huh Only the Lonely huh

5911.44 --> 5916.48
oh really It Isn't So what's this what's

5914.199 --> 5921.099999999999
the system you're using now

5916.48 --> 5923.82
right to go to your standard solar

5921.1 --> 5923.820000000001
system model

5923.92 --> 5929.08
right why don't you go look into

5927.04 --> 5931.659
how is that built what's the

5929.08 --> 5933.639
mathematical systems behind it

5931.659 --> 5935.92
ever heard of ice yeah yeah yeah I've

5933.639 --> 5939.28
heard of Einstein I also know that

5935.92 --> 5942.06
Einstein mathematics cannot create a

5939.28 --> 5945.34
solar system with forces because

5942.06 --> 5948.6990000000005
Einstein mechanics cannot account for

5945.34 --> 5952.42
more than one body of attraction

5948.699 --> 5953.739
yeah Infamous einsteinian gravity

5952.42 --> 5956.1
dilemma

5953.739 --> 5959.099999999999
Newton didn't have that problem you see

5956.1 --> 5963.219
that's why they still use Newton

5959.1 --> 5965.620000000001
mathematics for the solar system

5963.219 --> 5968.08
because yeah it's it's more than one

5965.62 --> 5970.48
body of Attraction Now isn't it I mean

5968.08 --> 5973.84
planets have moons so there is more than

5970.48 --> 5977.86
one body of Attraction yeah that cannot

5973.84 --> 5981.6
work with Einstein mathematics

5977.86 --> 5984.94
you can only apply everything separately

5981.6 --> 5989.7390000000005
and guess what when you apply everything

5984.94 --> 5992.0199999999995
separately you can't get it balanced it

5989.739 --> 5994.9
won't balance it's all just gonna run

5992.02 --> 5999.540000000001
amok immediately

5994.9 --> 6002.28
because only Newtonian mechanics allows

5999.54 --> 6003.78
multiple bodies to be calculated

6002.28 --> 6005.04
together

6003.78 --> 6007.0199999999995
yeah

6005.04 --> 6009.659
except for mercury because it will

6007.02 --> 6012.0
always keep falling into the Sun ah it

6009.659 --> 6014.699
won't fit it that one won't fit yeah so

6012.0 --> 6016.56
that part yeah a little Einstein Little

6014.699 --> 6018.96
Einstein paint

6016.56 --> 6021.780000000001
on the Newtonian painting of the solar

6018.96 --> 6023.4
system yeah I know that yeah that's what

6021.78 --> 6025.739
I've been explaining here in the last 15

6023.4 --> 6027.138999999999
minutes

6025.739 --> 6031.0199999999995
yeah

6027.139 --> 6032.659000000001
but uh yeah the solar system is

6031.02 --> 6036.659000000001
definitely not

6032.659 --> 6037.679
calculated gravity wise using Einstein

6036.659 --> 6040.92
mechanics

6037.679 --> 6044.1
because you can't do that you see it'll

6040.92 --> 6047.219
run a muck because you can't apply

6044.1 --> 6049.92
Einstein gravity mechanics

6047.219 --> 6052.08
to more than one body of Attraction so

6049.92 --> 6056.88
you cannot make it balanced that's why

6052.08 --> 6060.86
they have to have to no choice they have

6056.88 --> 6063.659000000001
no other option you see they have to use

6060.86 --> 6070.139
Newtonian mechanics they have no choice

6063.659 --> 6072.179
there's no other way to do it you see

6070.139 --> 6074.1
huh

6072.179 --> 6075.2390000000005
but they can't get Mercury to work

6074.1 --> 6077.820000000001
though

6075.239 --> 6080.459999999999
huh isn't that just

6077.82 --> 6083.0599999999995
basically a kick in the butt by the

6080.46 --> 6086.219
designer by God himself showing you

6083.06 --> 6088.320000000001
you're not gonna make this work

6086.219 --> 6091.62
you're not gonna make it work

6088.32 --> 6095.46
it cannot be made to work because it's a

6091.62 --> 6097.98
lie and you will always have a gap that

6095.46 --> 6100.5
you cannot fix and that you'll have to

6097.98 --> 6102.959999999999
smooth it over with lies because

6100.5 --> 6107.58
heliocentrism

6102.96 --> 6110.82
outer space fiction is a lie and it

6107.58 --> 6115.92
cannot be made to perfectly work

6110.82 --> 6119.28
for God's decree because it's a lie

6115.92 --> 6121.92
and so you will always be forced at some

6119.28 --> 6124.619
point to recognize that it doesn't work

6121.92 --> 6126.42
and you'll have to cover it up with lies

6124.619 --> 6128.88
Satan

6126.42 --> 6132.38
because it's his domain

6128.88 --> 6132.38
the domain of Lies

6133.679 --> 6139.139
right but hey ignorance is bliss so if

6136.56 --> 6140.88
you just don't know about it or you just

6139.139 --> 6143.1
make a quick excuse and just [ __ ] all

6140.88 --> 6145.38
over it and go away again they don't

6143.1 --> 6147.4800000000005
want to know it anymore this great it

6145.38 --> 6150.6
works perfectly then just don't think

6147.48 --> 6153.419999999999
about it yeah it's exactly what Satan

6150.6 --> 6155.6990000000005
wants he loves that [ __ ] don't inquire

6153.42 --> 6158.1
don't try to figure out what it is you

6155.699 --> 6159.239
believe in you'll just figure out its

6158.1 --> 6161.1
lies then

6159.239 --> 6165.299999999999
you don't want that you want a nice

6161.1 --> 6168.42
dream to believe in so just do that

6165.3 --> 6170.52
just learn how to make quick nonsense

6168.42 --> 6174.0
excuse as a reflex so you don't have to

6170.52 --> 6177.38
let the reality of it sink in that it's

6174.0 --> 6177.38
all based on lies

6179.179 --> 6183.32
all right

6180.53 --> 6187.5
[Music]

6183.32 --> 6187.5
foreign anyway

6187.8 --> 6192.08
since there's now only ballers in chat

6190.38 --> 6194.52
squirting

6192.08 --> 6196.44
Flat Earth has kind of drop to the

6194.52 --> 6198.42
background I think I'm gonna round out

6196.44 --> 6201.599999999999
the show

6198.42 --> 6203.6990000000005
[Music]

6201.6 --> 6208.639
shut the [ __ ] up a Google virus you're

6203.699 --> 6208.638999999999
projecting funny [ __ ] with lying scumbag

6210.78 --> 6213.679
you get a timeout

6215.76 --> 6221.280000000001
yeah no it's not like Flat Earth we try

6219.36 --> 6223.08
to figure out everything all the time

6221.28 --> 6225.54
there's a flatter of debate show in

6223.08 --> 6227.88
which we may figure out the mechanics of

6225.54 --> 6231.0199999999995
all things all the time every [ __ ]

6227.88 --> 6234.719
day yeah don't project your silly

6231.02 --> 6235.860000000001
retardation predicament unto us a kumu

6234.719 --> 6240.02
virus

6235.86 --> 6240.0199999999995
projecting funny [ __ ]

6245.4 --> 6248.4
foreign

6250.1 --> 6255.96
it's called an ad hom you [ __ ]

6253.08 --> 6259.38
dumbass Only the Lonely

6255.96 --> 6262.46
you don't even know what fallacies

6259.38 --> 6262.46
you're a dumbass

6264.6 --> 6268.46
you don't even know what you're saying

6269.46 --> 6273.32
it's called an ad hom

6276.9 --> 6281.759999999999
it's the fallacy he's using right

6279.9 --> 6284.099999999999
fallacy

6281.76 --> 6286.26
that's not even a normal way to use

6284.1 --> 6290.820000000001
language you don't tell that to somebody

6286.26 --> 6293.88
you point out what logical fallacy yeah

6290.82 --> 6296.639
and the logical fallacy was an ad hom

6293.88 --> 6299.82
it's a great one I love that at home

6296.639 --> 6302.639
Einstein was a disgusting pervert lying

6299.82 --> 6305.219
little scumbag and a [ __ ] [ __ ] on

6302.639 --> 6307.9800000000005
top of that math was the only thing he

6305.219 --> 6311.88
was even good at

6307.98 --> 6317.218999999999
he was a pathetic miscreant

6311.88 --> 6320.9400000000005
he did he literally didn't know how to

6317.219 --> 6325.26
tie his own shoelaces we're talking

6320.94 --> 6330.96
about an adult man who didn't know how

6325.26 --> 6330.96
to tie his shoelaces literally

6331.739 --> 6335.28
yeah

6333.06 --> 6338.639
I bet you didn't know that

6335.28 --> 6341.58
you [ __ ] dumbass

6338.639 --> 6344.46
Jesus Christ

6341.58 --> 6348.36
all these heliocentric idiots just

6344.46 --> 6350.76
worship literal retards

6348.36 --> 6353.36
and I think they're the brilliant people

6350.76 --> 6353.360000000001
of the world

6354.239 --> 6359.459999999999
not sure how that is relevant

6356.82 --> 6361.5599999999995
it is very relevant if you meet a person

6359.46 --> 6363.96
who says they're brilliant and they

6361.56 --> 6366.780000000001
can't tie their own shoelaces

6363.96 --> 6369.38
they might be lying

6366.78 --> 6369.38
huh

6375.719 --> 6381.3
right anyway I am gonna round out the

6378.48 --> 6382.98
show ah cool Nathan's put out the link

6381.3 --> 6385.92
awesome

6382.98 --> 6388.138999999999
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6385.92 --> 6390.4800000000005
like this show if you did then please

don't forget to rogans it up and if you

6390.48 --> 6394.44
haven't already subscribe to my channel

6392.34 --> 6396.360000000001
and hit the Bell notification so you

6394.44 --> 6398.219
know when I'm going live which is

6396.36 --> 6400.259999999999
normally 1pm Amsterdam time and the

6398.219 --> 6402.4800000000005

6400.26 --> 6404.639
weekend and please also do support me

6402.48 --> 6406.619

much appreciate it you can always use it

6408.96 --> 6412.8
so yeah

6410.34 --> 6415.26
any support would be great

6412.8 --> 6416.58
think that this show definitely deserve

6415.26 --> 6418.9800000000005
one I think

6416.58 --> 6420.6
then again I did actually have a day off

6418.98 --> 6422.759999999999
so

6420.6 --> 6425.54
having a day off does give me like a lot

6422.76 --> 6425.54
of energy boost

6425.58 --> 6430.98
so maybe I'll do it like on a weekly

6428.699 --> 6432.96
basis I don't know if I can get like a

6430.98 --> 6435.419999999999
really energetic show out of it every

6432.96 --> 6438.06
time then I'll do that maybe

6435.42 --> 6441.179
right anyway I'll be back tomorrow with

6438.06 --> 6442.679
flat Earth early bird number 1402 on a

6441.179 --> 6444.96
Tuesday and I'm gonna join the Flat

6442.679 --> 6446.76
Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley 9080

6444.96 --> 6447.9
Channel which should start up any minute

6446.76 --> 6450.54
now

6447.9 --> 6455.049999999999
hope to see you there in chat and until

6450.54 --> 6486.329
the next video keep it flat
