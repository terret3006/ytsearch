198.879 --> 202.879
4 am yang california i know

210.879 --> 213.84
right

224.959 --> 227.84
hello backs

228.72 --> 231.04
huh

231.519 --> 236.519
much

232.4 --> 236.519
support and love okay

241.519 --> 246.519
hello mike sidunich good morning

281.28 --> 283.84
right

286.88 --> 290.4
okay there is uh

290.8 --> 296.8
something i wanted to bring up i think i

294.0 --> 298.16
i might have done that earlier but could

296.8 --> 302.16
have forgotten

298.16 --> 302.16
because this guy that supported me

302.56 --> 308.88
baller that supported me

305.199 --> 311.28000000000003
uh was it a week ago or more

308.88 --> 313.68
through yeah that weird little stream of

311.28 --> 314.96
john hawkins where i got into chat

313.68 --> 318.0
and all that

314.96 --> 320.15999999999997
well he is like blocked here and i don't

318.0 --> 322.4
know how that's possible he's not in my

320.16 --> 322.40000000000003
list

323.12 --> 327.039
so i got the suspicion that some of my

325.68 --> 329.039
moderators

327.039 --> 331.28
are probably blocking him and that is

329.039 --> 332.88
giving this weird effect

331.28 --> 334.96
but yeah i

332.88 --> 338.4
i got a lot of moderators some which

334.96 --> 339.59999999999997
haven't come by for a long time i'm not

338.4 --> 343.039
gonna

339.6 --> 345.91900000000004
like undo all wrenches just

343.039 --> 347.919
to get him back in here

345.919 --> 350.24
so i'd like you to check

347.919 --> 352.4
if you have a wrench

350.24 --> 355.199
you have anybody blocked

352.4 --> 358.479
like on your google block list

355.199 --> 360.16
please get rid of that

358.479 --> 364.15999999999997
because

360.16 --> 366.47900000000004
uh if you block like block block

364.16 --> 369.03900000000004
actual active

366.479 --> 371.44
ballers and all that and not just

369.039 --> 374.96
obvious trolls

371.44 --> 378.479
that are using stock accounts then

374.96 --> 382.31899999999996
yeah once those people

378.479 --> 384.31899999999996
like settle down and stop being like

382.319 --> 387.759
dicks or whatever

384.319 --> 389.759
then they simply can't join streams that

387.759 --> 391.759
people that have wrenches

389.759 --> 393.199
have them blocked

391.759 --> 395.36
right and they don't even have to

393.199 --> 398.639
remember it's not like your block list

395.36 --> 401.44
is in your face all the time

398.639 --> 403.84000000000003
it's very disruptive actually that that

401.44 --> 405.28
seems to work like that so it asks you

403.84 --> 408.4
to

405.28 --> 411.919
check your google block list

408.4 --> 412.96
and remove everyone from that because

411.919 --> 416.31899999999996
it

412.96 --> 416.31899999999996
if you have a wrench that is

417.599 --> 421.199
because

418.639 --> 423.199
it just disrupts

421.199 --> 425.599
chat interaction

423.199 --> 425.599
a lot

429.84 --> 436.56
right

431.84 --> 439.28
and this guy nerdy ee

436.56 --> 443.28000000000003
he really seems to want he likes my show

439.28 --> 443.28
he said and he wants to get in the chat

443.759 --> 447.84000000000003
but

445.12 --> 450.08
yeah there's nothing i can do about it

447.84 --> 452.79999999999995
except ask you guys could you check if

450.08 --> 455.52
you have this nerdy ee guy blocked and

452.8 --> 457.84000000000003
if you do please unblock him

455.52 --> 457.84
anyway

463.599 --> 466.319
all right next

473.52 --> 476.56
right so yeah

477.44 --> 482.319
i'm still not completely out of the

480.16 --> 486.0
wonky area just yet

482.319 --> 486.0
but i'm getting a little better so

486.08 --> 490.71999999999997
it's weird i think i might be getting

488.24 --> 490.72
like a

491.36 --> 495.44
an actual flu response thing now

497.199 --> 502.8
so i might be getting like flu-like

499.84 --> 505.11999999999995
situation in the next week or something

502.8 --> 507.599
which is typical

505.12 --> 510.0
i kind of forgotten that does or that

507.599 --> 514.399
can come after

510.0 --> 516.56
like periods of well like gut sickness

514.399 --> 519.76
and emotionalness

516.56 --> 523.68
so that might be arriving

519.76 --> 523.68
or it'll just be like this

524.48 --> 529.839
uh

526.32 --> 529.839
this little extra

530.64 --> 536.8
like a feeling like you got a weight on

533.12 --> 538.08
it but then i won't get sick so anyway

536.8 --> 542.64
i'll be all right

538.08 --> 542.64
however it turns out to go you know

543.279 --> 546.8389999999999
it's not my first ride

545.2 --> 548.5600000000001
hello

546.839 --> 549.6
uh

548.56 --> 550.56
robert

549.6 --> 553.76
b

550.56 --> 553.76
yeah guns of nephron

555.36 --> 559.519
your name is coming becoming quite a

557.04 --> 561.519
hassle to read out

559.519 --> 563.76
anyway welcome to chat

561.519 --> 567.12
hello the akuma virus

563.76 --> 567.12

568.64 --> 573.92

573.92 --> 579.5999999999999
yet but

577.04 --> 579.5999999999999
getting there

583.36 --> 587.88
and this mint tea certainly is helping

594.8 --> 603.3199999999999
right anyway i'm uh up for subjects

598.8 --> 603.3199999999999
with debates yesterday that was good

604.32 --> 606.9590000000001

638.959 --> 644.56
the new movie yet

641.68 --> 647.5999999999999
but as i said yesterday i want to be

644.56 --> 651.5999999999999
like fully back to myself

647.6 --> 651.6
and not wonky at all when i watch that

652.72 --> 658.12
hey america silver patriot good to see

655.12 --> 658.12
you

663.76 --> 668.079
right i've been watching more of owen

665.519 --> 668.079
benjamin

669.76 --> 675.399
like finishing up like the

671.92 --> 675.399
hangout from

675.44 --> 677.9200000000001
monday

682.72 --> 688.0790000000001
the tuesday ones already popped up i

684.8 --> 691.5999999999999
haven't seen it yet

688.079 --> 695.1999999999999
i just finished the other one

691.6 --> 695.2
the kiano conclusion

695.68 --> 699.8
and yeah that was good

711.44 --> 718.399
what's doing last week very good okay

716.399 --> 719.68
well i've

718.399 --> 722.16
i've really

719.68 --> 726.079
only heard good things about it except

722.16 --> 726.079
for like technical commentary

726.8 --> 731.3599999999999
that was like uh

729.04 --> 734.48
could have been structured maybe with a

731.36 --> 738.0
little bit more drama and

734.48 --> 740.639
well universal complain like why is this

738.0 --> 740.639
a two part

741.279 --> 746.079
without saying it like on the movie

743.6 --> 746.0790000000001
poster

746.24 --> 750.48
it's it's just called dune instead of

748.72 --> 753.279
doom part one

750.48 --> 756.48
and that it is clearly part one

753.279 --> 759.04
so but yeah those are some minor

756.48 --> 762.8000000000001
criticisms

759.04 --> 765.4399999999999
and the rest of it is like very scenic

762.8 --> 766.639
very loyal to the original material from

765.44 --> 768.8800000000001
what i've heard because i haven't

766.639 --> 771.04
actually watched it

768.88 --> 775.8389999999999
so yeah i am looking forward to watching

771.04 --> 775.8389999999999
it but i want to be i just want to be

778.399 --> 782.72
yeah

780.72 --> 785.72
i just want to feel strong when i watch

782.72 --> 785.72
it

790.0 --> 795.0
there must be a particular yeah i know

823.199 --> 828.639
right but for me

826.16 --> 831.8389999999999
i got it ready for watching i'm not

828.639 --> 835.199
gonna just do it just yet

831.839 --> 835.1990000000001
that's too much just

836.079 --> 838.3199999999999
uh

839.76 --> 842.92
all right

862.24 --> 865.24
so

883.12 --> 885.839
hmm

885.92 --> 890.56
okay mitch from australia apparently

887.92 --> 891.76
uploaded a video haven't seen that yet

890.56 --> 895.959
like

891.76 --> 895.959
53 minutes ago

906.88 --> 909.88
hmm

912.48 --> 915.279
so yeah guys

916.399 --> 920.199
what do you want to talk about

929.519 --> 932.9590000000001
i got a question too

932.24 --> 936.0790000000001
to

932.959 --> 937.3599999999999
well typical followers right yesterday

936.079 --> 941.68
like

937.36 --> 944.16
that troll came in and he was bad

941.68 --> 946.079
and i got nasty

944.16 --> 948.399
and i'm just wondering

946.079 --> 949.7589999999999
in retrospect

948.399 --> 953.519
like

949.759 --> 954.8000000000001
is this the proper way to handle that

953.519 --> 957.279
or

954.8 --> 960.7199999999999
was this guy just so nasty that i should

957.279 --> 964.079
have just somehow locked him out

960.72 --> 964.0790000000001
and not even addressed him

964.24 --> 968.24
what do you think

965.839 --> 970.399
because i do get the feeling that every

968.24 --> 972.88
time i do get

970.399 --> 974.639
basically start like getting really

972.88 --> 976.079
aggressive

974.639 --> 978.399
towards

976.079 --> 982.56
well these types of troll individuals

978.399 --> 985.04
and i try to be very specific

982.56 --> 988.6389999999999
like really addressing the ones doing

985.04 --> 990.24
that sort of thing on that level

988.639 --> 992.9590000000001
but yeah it's still

990.24 --> 996.0790000000001
very aggressive message to the outside

992.959 --> 998.2399999999999
world and i wonder like

996.079 --> 1001.68
it probably overall doesn't really

998.24 --> 1001.6800000000001
reflect that well on me

1002.399 --> 1005.839
then again it is

1004.16 --> 1007.12
an honest

1005.839 --> 1010.12
direct

1007.12 --> 1010.12
communication

1010.16 --> 1015.4399999999999
but every time that happens i always get

1012.48 --> 1018.24
mixed feelings afterward

1015.44 --> 1020.72
it's like yeah i did it

1018.24 --> 1023.519
and like i stood my ground but that and

1020.72 --> 1026.16
like i didn't shy away didn't fear but

1023.519 --> 1028.4
at the same time like wow

1026.16 --> 1028.4
but

1030.4 --> 1037.1200000000001
it is kind of disruptive in a way and

1033.36 --> 1037.12
also realizing that just

1037.6 --> 1041.9189999999999
whatever i did

1039.28 --> 1045.76
the guy effectively did

1041.919 --> 1045.76
because of my engagement break

1046.319 --> 1051.2
the conversation that i was having

1048.88 --> 1054.16
he did like he effectively distracted

1051.2 --> 1056.72
away and i wonder like

1054.16 --> 1058.96
there must be a better way to deal with

1056.72 --> 1058.96
this

1060.88 --> 1065.1200000000001
but maybe i just need to be a little

1062.64 --> 1066.5590000000002
stronger in order to do that to just

1065.12 --> 1069.1999999999998
like

1066.559 --> 1071.44
not completely not let it in and yeah as

1069.2 --> 1073.8400000000001
i as everybody knows i'm a little bit

1071.44 --> 1073.8400000000001
wonky

1074.16 --> 1081.8400000000001
which kind of means more sensitive so

1077.6 --> 1081.84
maybe it's just not really an option

1082.08 --> 1086.48
right now

1083.919 --> 1089.88
anyway yeah it just wanted to address

1086.48 --> 1089.88
that for a moment

1104.32 --> 1108.0
that's because you're a nice person on

1106.0 --> 1110.4
the back

1108.0 --> 1112.559
i'd like to think i'm not just on the

1110.4 --> 1114.72
bottom

1112.559 --> 1116.16
i like to think i'm a nice person

1114.72 --> 1120.52
overall

1116.16 --> 1120.52
but not weak nice

1126.24 --> 1129.76
like i've throughout my life i've

1128.72 --> 1132.32
suffered

1129.76 --> 1136.72
greatly under my

1132.32 --> 1139.4399999999998
like principled fanatical niceness

1136.72 --> 1141.3600000000001
of even like hit behind it

1139.44 --> 1142.799
because it's

1141.36 --> 1144.0
it

1142.799 --> 1146.24
has

1144.0 --> 1148.16
tactical implications right

1146.24 --> 1152.08
but because of that

1148.16 --> 1152.0800000000002
once people get to know that about me

1153.6 --> 1162.9189999999999
it they become tempted to abuse it

1157.679 --> 1162.919
and that is eve that includes friends

1165.44 --> 1170.24
so i've kind of had to like

1168.32 --> 1173.039
drop the

1170.24 --> 1174.64
almost robotic nice attitude throughout

1173.039 --> 1178.4
my life

1174.64 --> 1181.8400000000001
and become more defensive and just see

1178.4 --> 1183.6000000000001
being able to so smoothly be nice

1181.84 --> 1187.12
and helpful

1183.6 --> 1189.28
even in at adverse situations

1187.12 --> 1191.1999999999998
as a luxury

1189.28 --> 1193.36
not just something i should be handing

1191.2 --> 1195.919
everybody all the time

1193.36 --> 1199.6
and i used to think that you see

1195.919 --> 1199.6000000000001
that was a really big problem

1200.16 --> 1204.96
our win is full of integrity and pretty

1202.96 --> 1206.4
yeah i guess so

1204.96 --> 1209.679
it just sounds weird

1206.4 --> 1209.679
when somebody tells you that

1215.36 --> 1219.9189999999999
it's just that when you're sensitive you

1217.76 --> 1222.0
pick up on everything including the

1219.919 --> 1223.8400000000001
details they weigh more on you and then

1222.0 --> 1226.4
you have a choice are you going to

1223.84 --> 1230.799
ignore it because it's so difficult and

1226.4 --> 1230.799
let it kind of fester in the background

1232.08 --> 1237.4399999999998
causing you to kind of shape away

1234.64 --> 1241.1200000000001
in contrast to it or do i just try to

1237.44 --> 1241.1200000000001
quickly address everything

1241.36 --> 1246.08
and get real about it

1243.2 --> 1249.1200000000001
so that i don't end up evading it but

1246.08 --> 1251.12
instead resolving it right because

1249.12 --> 1252.8799999999999
resolving an issue

1251.12 --> 1254.799
requires

1252.88 --> 1260.44
actual conscious attention and the

1254.799 --> 1260.44
decision to recognize its reality

1268.0 --> 1272.08
what is it with what masks what

1272.159 --> 1277.679
you did that that's creepy

1276.0 --> 1281.919
yeah george said i don't know man i

1277.679 --> 1285.679
think rob skiba was just really

1281.919 --> 1285.679
he kind of he was sold

1286.159 --> 1290.24
by accident you could say because i

1288.24 --> 1292.72
think he was trying to be a christian

1290.24 --> 1296.32
very much but he just

1292.72 --> 1299.039
he got trapped by the spell by the sea

1296.32 --> 1301.84
spell and with him it it manifested in

1299.039 --> 1305.36
masks and well as you say apparently

1301.84 --> 1310.84
even sold them right well you can't get

1305.36 --> 1310.84
more buying into something than that

1330.799 --> 1335.12
you're the boss mike sidunich okay

1339.679 --> 1343.679
well i'm certainly the boss of my show

1344.08 --> 1348.72
this givea get facts bald cheek

1346.72 --> 1351.1200000000001
i don't know

1348.72 --> 1353.3600000000001
i don't know if he did

1351.12 --> 1356.559
there is a lot of suspicion i think that

1353.36 --> 1360.24
he might have done it secretly

1356.559 --> 1363.9189999999999
and like was afraid to share it with

1360.24 --> 1366.559
others that would explain some things

1363.919 --> 1369.1200000000001
but even if he hadn't

1366.559 --> 1371.6789999999999
the procedure he rolled into would have

1369.12 --> 1371.6789999999999
killed him

1371.76 --> 1375.84
either way

1373.28 --> 1375.84
so

1388.32 --> 1392.6399999999999
what max

1390.0 --> 1394.88
need of money no that

1392.64 --> 1396.159
no he wouldn't have done that for that

1394.88 --> 1398.72
reason

1396.159 --> 1402.48
i think rob no as i said i think rob

1398.72 --> 1405.3600000000001
skibar actually believed it he didn't

1402.48 --> 1407.44
just like oh i'm gonna use the system

1405.36 --> 1409.6
and this evil spell to make money no

1407.44 --> 1411.919
that makes no sense i think he really

1409.6 --> 1414.7199999999998
believed it

1411.919 --> 1417.039
or maybe he just thought of the

1414.72 --> 1420.96
like the social effect he was like

1417.039 --> 1424.799
afraid to make other people afraid

1420.96 --> 1424.799
i think he wore the mask for that

1425.279 --> 1429.44
or maybe that's just the excuse and he

1427.52 --> 1431.6
was actually afraid

1429.44 --> 1434.64
like he caught

1431.6 --> 1435.6789999999999
the virus fair

1434.64 --> 1438.7990000000002
it's

1435.679 --> 1442.0
this is all after talk right

1438.799 --> 1442.0
we can't ask him now

1443.039 --> 1448.559
but the guy had issues like

1445.52 --> 1451.44
visibly he had issues with corona he

1448.559 --> 1451.44
didn't really

1452.08 --> 1455.52
he didn't get through it all

1456.08 --> 1459.039
like

1456.84 --> 1461.6
most well like

1459.039 --> 1463.36
everybody that i know like from the flat

1461.6 --> 1465.52
earth debates and all that

1463.36 --> 1467.1999999999998
like i don't know any flat earthers that

1465.52 --> 1469.84
would wear a mask

1467.2 --> 1471.3600000000001
like they all principally know like this

1469.84 --> 1472.8799999999999
is total [ __ ]

1471.36 --> 1475.1999999999998
not gonna do it

1472.88 --> 1476.24
don't care if other people are afraid of

1475.2 --> 1479.44
that

1476.24 --> 1480.64
and rob skiba kinda did he he didn't get

1479.44 --> 1483.1200000000001
through that

1480.64 --> 1487.3200000000002
he was held up by the spell and it

1483.12 --> 1487.32
probably led to his downfall

1490.4 --> 1494.5590000000002
doesn't make him bad

1492.799 --> 1495.52
makes him a little

1494.559 --> 1500.96
weak

1495.52 --> 1503.12
but not like evil weak just weak

1500.96 --> 1506.72
like yeah that can happen it's tragic

1503.12 --> 1506.7199999999998
it's just tragic most of it

1506.96 --> 1509.2
right

1509.44 --> 1514.2
i hope he's doing well on the other side

1514.799 --> 1523.12
because he he did do a lot of good

1518.72 --> 1523.1200000000001
so he definitely deserves a good path

1526.84 --> 1530.9189999999999
beyond ugh

1561.2 --> 1564.64
what

1562.159 --> 1568.159
okay wesley share that seem to ask

1564.64 --> 1568.159
complicated question there

1569.12 --> 1571.84
how much

1572.72 --> 1578.08
does anybody know about

1575.84 --> 1581.52
the spiritual psychology aspect of flat

1578.08 --> 1583.1999999999998
earth versus globe earth argument

1581.52 --> 1584.559
i didn't necessarily know that was a

1583.2 --> 1585.76
part of it

1584.559 --> 1589.2
i mean

1585.76 --> 1592.1589999999999
globals have their own conception as to

1589.2 --> 1595.279
why flat earthers do what they do

1592.159 --> 1596.5590000000002
from their global perspective which is

1595.279 --> 1598.4
very

1596.559 --> 1600.8799999999999
degrading

1598.4 --> 1603.279
they they literally in their conception

1600.88 --> 1606.48
see us as feeble minded for choosing

1603.279 --> 1610.0
what we do and then

1606.48 --> 1610.0
it's very strong manish

1611.6 --> 1616.1589999999999
right not empirical at all when asked

1616.559 --> 1621.12
we definitely have like elaborate

1618.96 --> 1623.1200000000001
responses as to why it's wrong usually

1621.12 --> 1626.3999999999999
always because they just have this

1623.12 --> 1628.0
really weakened straw man icon

1626.4 --> 1630.64
version of us

1628.0 --> 1630.64
in general

1636.64 --> 1641.3600000000001
i'm not saying that all flat earthers

1638.799 --> 1643.76
are psychologically or spiritually

1641.36 --> 1643.76
strong

1645.039 --> 1650.399
some of them are kind of weak

1647.679 --> 1652.0800000000002
but yeah they're all people

1650.399 --> 1655.84
so there's going to be strong ones and

1652.08 --> 1657.76
there's going to be weak ones

1655.84 --> 1660.559
anyway

1657.76 --> 1662.48
end of the grand cycle and ascension as

1660.559 --> 1667.48
well as in biblical harvest i don't know

1662.48 --> 1667.48
what the biblical harvest of teres is

1674.24 --> 1679.279
as for the end of the grand cycle of

1677.039 --> 1680.84
ascension

1679.279 --> 1684.08
i don't know about

1680.84 --> 1685.76
that i mean there's a certain ascension

1684.08 --> 1687.84
mechanic in

1685.76 --> 1691.36
building

1687.84 --> 1694.08
like in societal development

1691.36 --> 1695.6
but i don't know if we are like in the

1694.08 --> 1697.84
peak

1695.6 --> 1701.52
i think that we are riding like a

1697.84 --> 1704.08
technological peak in a way

1701.52 --> 1706.559
but i think that at the same time

1704.08 --> 1709.12
with all the technology like

1706.559 --> 1713.279
humanity has gained we've lost a lot of

1709.12 --> 1715.279
spiritual cohesion and skills like

1713.279 --> 1716.32
it's just been abandoned

1715.279 --> 1717.44
like

1716.32 --> 1720.08
that

1717.44 --> 1721.76
you don't need it to survive anymore

1720.08 --> 1724.48
it's like

1721.76 --> 1726.96
chivalry right

1724.48 --> 1729.3600000000001
chivalry is now like oh that's like

1726.96 --> 1731.679
really nice that's awesome that's epic

1729.36 --> 1734.1589999999999
that's cool when you do that it's really

1731.679 --> 1736.8400000000001
inspiring well

1734.159 --> 1739.6000000000001
a few hundred years ago

1736.84 --> 1743.36
chevrolet was not cool

1739.6 --> 1745.1999999999998
and inspiring it wasn't absolutely dead

1743.36 --> 1747.76
on necessity

1745.2 --> 1752.559
because if you weren't chivalrous

1747.76 --> 1754.48
then you were very devious and evil

1752.559 --> 1757.52
like

1754.48 --> 1760.96
it had a whole different function shift

1757.52 --> 1762.6399999999999
it was really like a necessary code

1760.96 --> 1764.64
to go about

1762.64 --> 1765.76
and to attain

1764.64 --> 1768.0800000000002
power

1765.76 --> 1770.0
because if you weren't chivalrous then

1768.08 --> 1772.399
you were danger

1770.0 --> 1777.44
danger to be corrupted

1772.399 --> 1777.4399999999998
by evil and greed and selfishness

1777.679 --> 1783.1200000000001
and darkness evil like

1781.679 --> 1785.52
right

1783.12 --> 1787.76
chivalrous people wouldn't like torture

1785.52 --> 1788.559
their enemies for example

1787.76 --> 1789.52
well

1788.559 --> 1791.9189999999999
yeah

1789.52 --> 1793.52
if you weren't chivalrous then it's like

1791.919 --> 1795.679
oh [ __ ]

1793.52 --> 1797.84
serious danger here we can't trust this

1795.679 --> 1800.48
one

1797.84 --> 1801.9189999999999
it wouldn't just be like ah he's just in

1800.48 --> 1803.44
a

1801.919 --> 1806.8400000000001
bad place

1803.44 --> 1808.3990000000001
no it would have consequences a lot of

1806.84 --> 1812.399
consequences

1808.399 --> 1815.52
right so chivalry now is very different

1812.399 --> 1816.8799999999999
because of how society's development

1815.52 --> 1820.08
developed

1816.88 --> 1822.96
and the technologies and like new ways

1820.08 --> 1825.6
of

1822.96 --> 1828.3990000000001
of social control and law and that kind

1825.6 --> 1831.12
of doesn't work it's not a necessity

1828.399 --> 1833.9189999999999
anymore it's more like a relic right now

1831.12 --> 1836.9599999999998
but effectively

1833.919 --> 1839.679
the entire society

1836.96 --> 1841.44
like a uniform thing

1839.679 --> 1844.48
has been corrupting

1841.44 --> 1847.279
so actually chivalry has always been a

1844.48 --> 1851.3600000000001
necessity it's just kind of

1847.279 --> 1853.6
been misunderstood and poot

1851.36 --> 1855.039
and exchanged for

1853.6 --> 1858.9599999999998
modern

1855.039 --> 1858.96
immoral or amoral

1862.84 --> 1869.279
pragmatism like away from natural

1867.039 --> 1870.96
good behavior

1869.279 --> 1875.279
right

1870.96 --> 1875.279
so yeah it's a very complicated question

1875.679 --> 1880.24
i hope you appreciate my response

1878.399 --> 1883.12
i don't think we're in a grand cycle

1880.24 --> 1885.1200000000001
right now we're not in the peak because

1883.12 --> 1887.6
look that it doesn't work that way in

1885.12 --> 1887.6
the peak

1888.0 --> 1893.2
everybody would peak

1890.08 --> 1897.36
in it in a when it gets it peak

1893.2 --> 1901.3600000000001
everybody peaks including the autopilot

1897.36 --> 1901.36
people right that's not happening

1902.159 --> 1906.88
it it would rather make me think we're

1904.48 --> 1909.84
actually in the opposite we're

1906.88 --> 1912.64
maybe at getting hitting the bottom

1909.84 --> 1912.6399999999999
of a dale

1913.12 --> 1919.36
and that would be logical considering

1914.96 --> 1921.44
that roughly 200 years ago or more

1919.36 --> 1923.1999999999998
there were people

1921.44 --> 1926.799
unleashing this

1923.2 --> 1927.8400000000001
this satanic conspiracy that is kind of

1926.799 --> 1930.799
having

1927.84 --> 1932.1589999999999
one of its climaxes again

1930.799 --> 1933.9189999999999
right it did

1932.159 --> 1935.679
like 80 years ago and it's doing it

1933.919 --> 1938.159
right now again

1935.679 --> 1941.039
so it it doesn't feel like we are

1938.159 --> 1943.44
actually growing to the peak no it's

1941.039 --> 1946.64
it's been going downhill

1943.44 --> 1950.72
after that point after the conspiracy is

1946.64 --> 1952.7990000000002
conspiring oligarchy the robber barons

1950.72 --> 1954.32
from the 19th century

1952.799 --> 1956.799
their psychological warfare and the

1954.32 --> 1959.84
communism that came out of it and etc

1956.799 --> 1963.679
etc and then nazism they kind of mixed

1959.84 --> 1965.12
in with all of it and now it's corporate

1963.679 --> 1968.159
amoral

1965.12 --> 1970.32
like domination thing

1968.159 --> 1972.24
evil

1970.32 --> 1974.6399999999999
we are not peaking

1972.24 --> 1977.36
in consciousness no

1974.64 --> 1978.3990000000001
everything the average is actually going

1977.36 --> 1980.399
bottom

1978.399 --> 1981.5189999999998
going to the bottom a deal

1980.399 --> 1983.12
but

1981.519 --> 1985.76
that doesn't mean

1983.12 --> 1988.08
that there cannot be the contrast you

1985.76 --> 1988.08
see

1988.24 --> 1991.919
remember what i told about the balance

1990.0 --> 1994.72
between light and darkness

1991.919 --> 1997.039
when light gets very strong there is a

1994.72 --> 1999.44
darkness that will brew

1997.039 --> 2001.12
to form the contrast

1999.44 --> 2002.559
when darkness

2001.12 --> 2004.7199999999998
peaks

2002.559 --> 2007.84
there will be light

2004.72 --> 2010.88
like leaking through

2007.84 --> 2015.9189999999999
and that actually spurs on much much a

2010.88 --> 2018.48
rapid like emergency awakening

2015.919 --> 2020.7990000000002
right so i think that the entire

2018.48 --> 2022.559
awakening that we've been going through

2020.799 --> 2024.559
for

2022.559 --> 2025.36
a couple of years now

2024.559 --> 2026.96
is

2025.36 --> 2030.6399999999999
not the peak

2026.96 --> 2033.76
of a cycle it's actually an emergency

2030.64 --> 2036.5590000000002
awakening in response to the bottom

2033.76 --> 2036.559
of a cycle

2037.2 --> 2040.0800000000002
that's what i think

2040.24 --> 2043.919
but

2041.44 --> 2045.279
because of the setting because of the

2043.919 --> 2048.879
opportunities

2045.279 --> 2051.2
through the internet communication

2048.879 --> 2053.52
the bottom dwellers get worse they get

2051.2 --> 2055.919
more demonic we are all seeing it it's

2053.52 --> 2058.879
all gradually shifting further and

2055.919 --> 2061.359
further this is undeniable

2058.879 --> 2062.7999999999997
but at the same time those that seek the

2061.359 --> 2066.639
light

2062.8 --> 2069.04
are also very easy to gather it

2066.639 --> 2071.679
you see and that's the polarization it's

2069.04 --> 2073.119
the contrast between the sleepers

2071.679 --> 2075.44
and the awakened

2073.119 --> 2078.079
other way around this yeah the sleepers

2075.44 --> 2080.32
and the awakened

2078.079 --> 2080.32
and

2082.32 --> 2088.7200000000003
but that's a process that's kind of just

2085.839 --> 2091.2
happening in response to what seems to

2088.72 --> 2092.7999999999997
me like the bottom

2091.2 --> 2095.4399999999996
the dale

2092.8 --> 2099.119
of a cycle not the top

2095.44 --> 2102.44
so hope you appreciate that analysis

2099.119 --> 2102.44
very serious

2124.88 --> 2127.88
hmm

2144.0 --> 2148.28
ah thank you slo-mo moon buggy

2193.119 --> 2196.7200000000003
yeah yeah i'm proud of it it was a good

2195.119 --> 2199.2000000000003
analysis

2196.72 --> 2201.2799999999997
it's very worth considering keeping in

2199.2 --> 2203.5989999999997
your mind and

2201.28 --> 2203.599
because

2204.64 --> 2208.56
it's tough you know when you're going

2206.8 --> 2211.44
through something that you really take

2208.56 --> 2213.68
notice of and it's like impressing you

2211.44 --> 2214.7200000000003
you tend to center everything around

2213.68 --> 2216.24
that

2214.72 --> 2218.64
in a quick

2216.24 --> 2220.16
oversight analysis

2218.64 --> 2222.7999999999997
right so you think oh and we're

2220.16 --> 2225.5989999999997
awakening that means everybody's now in

2222.8 --> 2227.8390000000004
the peak of awaking no it's not let's

2225.599 --> 2229.839
get real let's look what's out there

2227.839 --> 2230.88
really what's really happening with the

2229.839 --> 2234.32
average

2230.88 --> 2235.6800000000003
like how did the extra generations

2234.32 --> 2238.32
how

2235.68 --> 2240.839
visibly a majority of them are getting

2238.32 --> 2245.839
more and more derailed more

2240.839 --> 2245.839
lost more without a spirit map

2246.48 --> 2248.2400000000002
right

2247.52 --> 2250.8
now

2248.24 --> 2254.72
there's the contrast because some do

2250.8 --> 2256.7200000000003
wake up and they they really burn right

2254.72 --> 2260.48
but that's

2256.72 --> 2263.7599999999998
they're responsive they are reactionary

2260.48 --> 2265.359
they awaken as a reaction to the dimming

2263.76 --> 2268.2400000000002
down of the world

2265.359 --> 2272.0789999999997
like a built-in spiritual mechanism that

2268.24 --> 2275.2799999999997
just happens it's part of the design

2272.079 --> 2279.8390000000004
but the awakening is not the driving

2275.28 --> 2279.8390000000004
force it's the reactionary force

2279.92 --> 2288.0
it can still do some real magic though

2284.16 --> 2288.0
can still have a major impact

2289.119 --> 2297.96
but the overall trend is down

2293.04 --> 2297.96
for the average for the autopilot people

2308.16 --> 2312.8799999999997
god made evolution it was part of the

2310.48 --> 2316.079
plan well god made

2312.88 --> 2318.1600000000003
the delusion of evolution and that was

2316.079 --> 2322.0
part of the plan i would agree with that

2318.16 --> 2323.92
but evolution doesn't exist

2322.0 --> 2327.44
adaptation exists

2323.92 --> 2328.8
but only because adaptation is a

2327.44 --> 2331.44
design

2328.8 --> 2335.32
centric concept

2331.44 --> 2335.32
and it actually works

2354.32 --> 2359.44
we are not clones we yeah that has

2356.96 --> 2361.839
that's called cross braiding

2359.44 --> 2364.96
it's called braiding that's normal this

2361.839 --> 2369.839
set of pools set of designs

2364.96 --> 2369.839
right so every group of people has

2370.48 --> 2375.44
a couple of designs in them or a whole

2373.28 --> 2378.88
bunch depending on

2375.44 --> 2381.28
how how cohesive and strong and spirited

2378.88 --> 2383.119
gene pool is

2381.28 --> 2385.76
can have more

2383.119 --> 2386.96
characters

2385.76 --> 2389.0400000000004
more

2386.96 --> 2390.8
designs

2389.04 --> 2393.68
kept within it

2390.8 --> 2396.6400000000003
one person can have all kinds of

2393.68 --> 2399.9199999999996
blueprints stored it's part of the

2396.64 --> 2403.2799999999997
design just like we could never achieve

2399.92 --> 2405.839
anything like that by our design

2403.28 --> 2408.2400000000002
this is god's design

2405.839 --> 2411.359
right but they are all designs and

2408.24 --> 2414.24
they're stored

2411.359 --> 2414.24
like a crystal

2417.599 --> 2422.079
but there is no

2419.28 --> 2424.7200000000003
gradual alteration there is only

2422.079 --> 2427.52
adaptation and adaptation

2424.72 --> 2427.52
goes back

2428.0 --> 2432.24
species creature

2430.16 --> 2434.72
over generations can adapt to their

2432.24 --> 2438.56
environment or situation

2434.72 --> 2441.68
and they can adapt right back yeah

2438.56 --> 2441.68
that's not evolution

2443.359 --> 2449.2
it's all based on the design it's design

2446.48 --> 2451.44
centric the blueprint

2449.2 --> 2454.0789999999997
the blueprint of a person

2451.44 --> 2456.16
how much cohesion is left of the

2454.079 --> 2458.1600000000003
original design

2456.16 --> 2460.48
because we lose

2458.16 --> 2462.3999999999996
cohesion of the design

2460.48 --> 2463.2
due to entropy

2462.4 --> 2465.599
and

2463.2 --> 2467.68
yeah environmental

2465.599 --> 2470.4
damaging influences

2467.68 --> 2471.839
things we do to ourselves

2470.4 --> 2474.1600000000003
poison

2471.839 --> 2475.52
right sometimes it just

2474.16 --> 2478.0
shifts

2475.52 --> 2480.48
epigenetics for example

2478.0 --> 2482.48
and that could be considered a

2480.48 --> 2483.44
adaptation effect

2482.48 --> 2487.119
but

2483.44 --> 2489.76
yeah it can literally damage and then

2487.119 --> 2493.839
an actual damaged design

2489.76 --> 2495.92
will start to display mutations

2493.839 --> 2498.359
behavior and gets worse and worse the

2495.92 --> 2501.2000000000003
further it degenerates you can't really

2498.359 --> 2502.64
undegenerate it right

2501.2 --> 2504.96
if you could

2502.64 --> 2504.96
well

2506.16 --> 2510.96
that would solve a whole bunch of things

2511.44 --> 2516.56
but yeah i think that right now what

2514.079 --> 2518.48
they're probably trying to do is just oh

2516.56 --> 2521.119
let's get out the damaged parts and

2518.48 --> 2522.72
insert better parts from something else

2521.119 --> 2525.119
but they don't know what they're doing

2522.72 --> 2527.839
when they do that

2525.119 --> 2530.7200000000003
you're not supposed to

2527.839 --> 2532.24
play around with the design like that if

2530.72 --> 2535.7599999999998
it's damaged

2532.24 --> 2537.839
that damage is like a

2535.76 --> 2540.0
timeless marker

2537.839 --> 2543.359
you can try to replace it but it's not

2540.0 --> 2547.52
gonna like totally make a new design

2543.359 --> 2550.7599999999998
it's yet another mutation it's

2547.52 --> 2550.7599999999998
it's complicated

2552.319 --> 2556.64
right so there is adaptation and there

2555.04 --> 2560.48
is mutation

2556.64 --> 2560.48
evolution does not exist

2561.599 --> 2566.7200000000003
no new complete design will spring up

2564.96 --> 2569.119
out of nothing

2566.72 --> 2570.56
where it was not there before that

2569.119 --> 2573.56
doesn't happen

2570.56 --> 2573.56
naturally

2625.839 --> 2630.48
yeah

2627.119 --> 2632.7200000000003
i know wish listler sure yeah look fauci

2630.48 --> 2636.48
was literally a born

2632.72 --> 2636.48
and raised blackguard

2636.88 --> 2642.4
an open even evil person like he can't

2640.56 --> 2645.359
get more blackguard than that guy like

2642.4 --> 2646.56
he was literally born and raised to be

2645.359 --> 2652.319
evil

2646.56 --> 2654.96
and open to be a stage agitator

2652.319 --> 2657.92
he's made for that he don't know how to

2654.96 --> 2657.92
do anything else

2658.96 --> 2662.48
he's a black guard

2660.8 --> 2667.5600000000004
and if you don't know what that means

2662.48 --> 2667.56
then you're probably not into d and d

2685.2 --> 2688.64
why is chat on slow

2687.359 --> 2692.319
well because

2688.64 --> 2692.319
some people want to spam

2692.64 --> 2697.04
and i take it you're probably one of

2694.96 --> 2699.52
them because you're complaining about

2697.04 --> 2701.599
not being able to type quicker well i

2699.52 --> 2704.8
don't need you to type quicker right if

2701.599 --> 2707.04
you have a lot to say then say it in

2704.8 --> 2708.0
a piece of text there's 200 characters

2707.04 --> 2710.24
in them

2708.0 --> 2713.839
yeah i don't need you to spam two-word

2710.24 --> 2717.0789999999997
sentences like 10 times

2713.839 --> 2717.0789999999997
in a row

2722.319 --> 2728.119
hello getting sick

2724.319 --> 2728.119
by the way cleary

2785.839 --> 2794.16
what by the way like what

2789.119 --> 2794.1600000000003
adamic and pre-adamic men living

2799.319 --> 2804.72
side-by-side that's what

2802.48 --> 2804.72
where

2810.48 --> 2815.56
this seems like quite a presupposition

2812.56 --> 2815.56
there

2826.4 --> 2831.0
opposite polarized soul but

2834.0 --> 2837.68
i don't think that has anything to do

2836.079 --> 2840.96
with like

2837.68 --> 2843.9199999999996
genetic heritage

2840.96 --> 2845.599
the opposite poet no that how your soul

2843.92 --> 2848.0
is polarized

2845.599 --> 2850.88
it manifests naturally it's a purely

2848.0 --> 2853.04
spiritual process it's elusive

2850.88 --> 2854.2400000000002
people try to steer it like in their

2853.04 --> 2856.5589999999997
kids

2854.24 --> 2860.8799999999997
but they can't really

2856.559 --> 2862.1600000000003
right if they switch they switch

2860.88 --> 2864.1600000000003
right it's

2862.16 --> 2866.3999999999996
it's part of the design it's in

2864.16 --> 2869.04
unfortunate but it's like a necessary

2866.4 --> 2872.559
challenge i think

2869.04 --> 2876.079
so that you can't just always and like

2872.559 --> 2878.4
you can't ban opposition

2876.079 --> 2878.4
right

2879.599 --> 2883.52
from a god from god's design perspective

2882.16 --> 2885.52
like

2883.52 --> 2888.16
you're not supposed to be able to

2885.52 --> 2889.119
completely ban all opposition and that's

2888.16 --> 2893.7599999999998
why

2889.119 --> 2893.76
as kids grow up they will just choose

2894.24 --> 2899.2
you can't really stop it

2897.119 --> 2901.359
you can try to nudge it you can try to

2899.2 --> 2902.5589999999997
encourage in a direction but you can't

2901.359 --> 2905.68
stop it

2902.559 --> 2908.079
whatever they're gonna choose

2905.68 --> 2912.5989999999997
freedom of choice

2908.079 --> 2912.599
of a new soul entering the world

2914.24 --> 2919.7599999999998
i don't think it has anything to do with

2916.16 --> 2922.0789999999997
like racial heritage or like ooh

2919.76 --> 2925.28
pre-adamic man and all that

2922.079 --> 2929.28
no like show me this pre-adamic man

2925.28 --> 2932.559
please wesley share please show me

2929.28 --> 2932.559
like anything about it

2932.88 --> 2935.6800000000003
right because if you're gonna point it

2934.079 --> 2938.4
like oh look at the

2935.68 --> 2940.3999999999996
the giants with the red hair graveyards

2938.4 --> 2942.319
and all that in america and all these

2940.4 --> 2944.8
other it's like oh really how do you

2942.319 --> 2946.48
know that's pretty adamic

2944.8 --> 2947.28
i think that's post-adamic i think

2946.48 --> 2950.319
that's

2947.28 --> 2953.28
a lot of [ __ ] happened since adam

2950.319 --> 2957.2
maybe adam himself was like one of them

2953.28 --> 2959.92
maybe we all kind of were

2957.2 --> 2959.9199999999996
we don't know

2960.24 --> 2963.359
we don't know for sure

2963.44 --> 2968.2400000000002
right we don't really have like a

2965.359 --> 2971.72
genetic samples of like this ancient

2968.24 --> 2971.72
giant species

2972.079 --> 2978.1600000000003
that seems to have died out mostly to

2974.64 --> 2978.16
compare to us

2981.04 --> 2985.16
not that i know of anyway

2988.079 --> 2993.2400000000002
what does polarized souls even mean

2998.48 --> 3004.96
well a polarized soul is one that

3001.68 --> 3007.839
polarizes against others

3004.96 --> 3010.4
that want yeah polarization right

3007.839 --> 3013.2
creating camps creating

3010.4 --> 3015.52
splitting it up to pro

3013.2 --> 3015.52
con

3017.52 --> 3020.88
like

3018.319 --> 3023.2799999999997
pointing out the differences

3020.88 --> 3025.92
and then

3023.28 --> 3028.079
like don't work to unite but work to

3025.92 --> 3033.119
separate

3028.079 --> 3033.119
and that can be potentially a good thing

3033.839 --> 3037.88
it all depends on the context

3054.599 --> 3061.2000000000003
pre-epidemic was prior age

3058.0 --> 3063.599
prior age everything is lost

3061.2 --> 3063.5989999999997
yeah but

3064.96 --> 3067.2
what

3067.599 --> 3072.2400000000002
now but now you're just pointing at a at

3070.4 --> 3073.599
a classification of

3072.24 --> 3075.839
time

3073.599 --> 3077.6800000000003
a period in history how does that relate

3075.839 --> 3080.319
to the actual

3077.68 --> 3083.359
genetics supposedly right that was what

3080.319 --> 3086.24
he was talking about

3083.359 --> 3089.44
different creations designs academic

3086.24 --> 3091.359
pre-adams so what is this difference

3089.44 --> 3093.28
when you just say like oh yeah that's

3091.359 --> 3096.64
the pre-adamic people were just the

3093.28 --> 3098.1600000000003
people that lived before that well who's

3096.64 --> 3101.1189999999997
to say they were the different people

3098.16 --> 3101.1189999999997
you don't know that

3102.16 --> 3107.1189999999997
so you're putting it in a completely

3104.0 --> 3111.839
different context now clearly

3107.119 --> 3111.839
it's not exactly clearing it up

3143.839 --> 3149.04
huh yeah wesley sure i

3146.4 --> 3150.88
i agree with that

3149.04 --> 3152.96
isn't it

3150.88 --> 3157.04
it's like the darkness is trying to

3152.96 --> 3157.04
force us awaken it's like they are

3161.92 --> 3166.839
maybe they're trying to make us take

3163.839 --> 3166.839
over

3168.64 --> 3172.7999999999997
i mean i feel like i want to

3173.359 --> 3176.319
right i've been

3175.2 --> 3177.4399999999996
very

3176.319 --> 3180.319
adamant

3177.44 --> 3181.76
about my positions about what i think

3180.319 --> 3183.2
should happen

3181.76 --> 3186.2000000000003
very

3183.2 --> 3186.2
unrestrained

3192.24 --> 3198.16
i i got a really weird feeling like they

3195.28 --> 3200.88
are literally just like

3198.16 --> 3203.1189999999997
imagine these people have sacrificed

3200.88 --> 3205.6800000000003
everything including spiritual and

3203.119 --> 3207.52
psychological cohesion

3205.68 --> 3210.7999999999997
in favor of their control they

3207.52 --> 3213.2
sacrificed everything to their control

3210.8 --> 3216.1600000000003
i think they just went out

3213.2 --> 3218.24
but they can't and they can't end it

3216.16 --> 3220.72
they can't stop doing

3218.24 --> 3223.1189999999997
what the system wants them to do so

3220.72 --> 3225.04
maybe they are literally like

3223.119 --> 3228.2400000000002
actually

3225.04 --> 3230.88
begging us could you please

3228.24 --> 3233.52
put us out of our misery and take over

3230.88 --> 3235.599
we don't want to do this anymore but we

3233.52 --> 3237.839
can't stop please put us out of our

3235.599 --> 3237.839
misery

3238.64 --> 3241.68
ever thought about that

3244.16 --> 3247.16
really

3253.92 --> 3257.04
never thought about that

3257.119 --> 3260.88
you know that having

3259.04 --> 3262.5589999999997
all that power

3260.88 --> 3264.079
is

3262.559 --> 3264.88
without

3264.079 --> 3269.04
like

3264.88 --> 3271.599
a godly reward without just

3269.04 --> 3273.44
genuinely long-term good things and

3271.599 --> 3276.1600000000003
comfort and like

3273.44 --> 3277.76
knowing oh god at least i'm not gonna be

3276.16 --> 3279.839
punished for this

3277.76 --> 3282.2400000000002
they don't have any of that right they

3279.839 --> 3284.0789999999997
don't have that

3282.24 --> 3287.4399999999996
but they can't stop

3284.079 --> 3290.2400000000002
they don't seem to be able to stop

3287.44 --> 3292.079
so maybe they're literally just like

3290.24 --> 3293.68
pulling down the curtains and saying

3292.079 --> 3296.6400000000003
like hello

3293.68 --> 3298.24
yes we're a wizard yes we're gonna kill

3296.64 --> 3300.319
you

3298.24 --> 3302.799
am i getting through yet what are you

3300.319 --> 3305.04
gonna do about it right i just have to

3302.799 --> 3307.04
work these [ __ ] switches all the time

3305.04 --> 3310.64
and i'm sick of it

3307.04 --> 3313.52
i don't want to le this is hell i like

3310.64 --> 3315.1189999999997
can't even

3313.52 --> 3317.359
like

3315.119 --> 3320.079
change anything just can only these

3317.359 --> 3321.52
[ __ ] switches can you please just

3320.079 --> 3324.1600000000003
kill me

3321.52 --> 3326.24
just get rid of me and take over i don't

3324.16 --> 3328.319
want to do this anymore

3326.24 --> 3331.2799999999997
isn't it kind of

3328.319 --> 3335.839
in a way feeling like that

3331.28 --> 3335.8390000000004
it's all so over the top

3335.92 --> 3339.2000000000003
right

3337.28 --> 3340.799
it's like the only

3339.2 --> 3343.359
reward they even get out of it is

3340.799 --> 3345.92
temporary like sadistic pleasure of the

3343.359 --> 3348.16
mind control because what's their other

3345.92 --> 3351.2000000000003
rewards

3348.16 --> 3351.2
there's barely any

3351.76 --> 3358.079
they are the most miserable people

3355.44 --> 3360.079
they have nothing

3358.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
i think they just want us to get rid of

3360.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
them because they can't stop

3365.52 --> 3370.04
am i being a little too radical here

3379.92 --> 3385.44
has nobody ever

3382.4 --> 3387.76
thought of it like that before nobody

3385.44 --> 3387.76
here

3389.599 --> 3394.1600000000003
the notion is relatively new to me

3395.76 --> 3399.88
not radical all right

3407.839 --> 3411.0
right

3408.96 --> 3413.76
i think that we might have just

3411.0 --> 3416.48
demoralized the darkness so much by

3413.76 --> 3418.7990000000004
showing us how much freedom you have

3416.48 --> 3420.559
not being that and they just want out

3418.799 --> 3422.24
they just want our freedom but they can

3420.559 --> 3424.6400000000003
never get it so they're just like can

3422.24 --> 3425.68
you please just

3424.64 --> 3429.359
end us

3425.68 --> 3431.5989999999997
and the torture we don't want to see

3429.359 --> 3431.5989999999997
you

3431.68 --> 3434.96
just flourishing

3435.28 --> 3440.0
realizing that we could never do that

3437.68 --> 3442.8799999999997
because we sacrificed all of that for

3440.0 --> 3444.96
this stupid control and now the program

3442.88 --> 3447.28
is even completely erratic and

3444.96 --> 3449.52
nonsensical only getting worse and we

3447.28 --> 3451.2000000000003
don't want to do this anymore but we

3449.52 --> 3453.7599999999998
don't know how to stop

3451.2 --> 3456.96
we are spellbound we're locked in

3453.76 --> 3458.7990000000004
through blackmail and contracts

3456.96 --> 3461.52
and just no more

3458.799 --> 3464.319
social spiritual maneuvering room to do

3461.52 --> 3467.04
anything else we can't get out but we

3464.319 --> 3468.799
want out it's punishing we want to stop

3467.04 --> 3471.7599999999998
this but we can't stop this can you

3468.799 --> 3471.7599999999998
please stop us

3473.119 --> 3478.76
is it like that

3475.04 --> 3478.7599999999998
i feel it is

3488.44 --> 3491.469
[Music]

3493.92 --> 3496.2400000000002
right

3496.48 --> 3500.079
just look at biden for example

3499.2 --> 3503.839
in this

3500.079 --> 3506.7200000000003
freak sun like isn't

3503.839 --> 3508.72
you can't get more like hello here's the

3506.72 --> 3510.72
wizard behind the curtain we're all

3508.72 --> 3512.9599999999996
freaks

3510.72 --> 3515.359
we're going to mock up everything you

3512.96 --> 3519.28
know we're going to mock it up

3515.359 --> 3519.2799999999997
we can't stop mocking it up

3524.0 --> 3528.559
like he's almost like the pinnacle of

3526.0 --> 3528.559
that effect

3528.72 --> 3533.2799999999997
it's just this giant billboard please

3531.599 --> 3535.119
stop us

3533.28 --> 3538.0
please stop us

3535.119 --> 3539.599
please stop us

3538.0 --> 3541.599
and they're starting to

3539.599 --> 3543.839
not just show it they're starting to

3541.599 --> 3547.3590000000004
literally bang you on the head with it

3543.839 --> 3552.839
now please stop us please stop us please

3547.359 --> 3552.839
stop us we can't stop please stop us

3622.559 --> 3626.4
okay

3623.68 --> 3628.64
godzilla who are you talking to exactly

3626.4 --> 3630.4
seems to be saying no incorrect but i

3628.64 --> 3632.24
don't know who you're talking to

3630.4 --> 3635.2400000000002
are you talking about what i'm talking

3632.24 --> 3635.24
about

3643.28 --> 3649.599
i only have one drive hate well godzilla

3647.2 --> 3652.319
you may have heard of my saying hatred

3649.599 --> 3656.0
is unanswered love

3652.319 --> 3658.88
so that completely fits

3656.0 --> 3660.799
the context of what i just said

3658.88 --> 3662.2400000000002
yes they are filled with hatred they are

3660.799 --> 3664.4
not of

3662.24 --> 3667.2
our father

3664.4 --> 3668.1600000000003
but that doesn't like

3667.2 --> 3670.3999999999996
it is

3668.16 --> 3673.839
that though

3670.4 --> 3676.7200000000003
it effectively is that right

3673.839 --> 3678.72
in like a like a spousal argument and

3676.72 --> 3681.52
gets really bad

3678.72 --> 3683.839
you might have stuck to that for a while

3681.52 --> 3685.7599999999998
because i recommend you get out as soon

3683.839 --> 3688.72
as that really starts to happen or you

3685.76 --> 3691.3590000000004
fix it as quick as possible permanent a

3688.72 --> 3694.48
good solution permanent sounds

3691.359 --> 3694.48
dangerous but

3695.119 --> 3700.2400000000002
yeah

3697.119 --> 3702.2400000000002
don't they do that isn't like

3700.24 --> 3704.72
your woman attacking you super

3702.24 --> 3707.4399999999996
frustrated isn't that like

3704.72 --> 3709.68
stop this stop this stop this stop this

3707.44 --> 3709.68
right

3710.4 --> 3715.76
it just

3712.72 --> 3717.0389999999998
it just feels like that

3715.76 --> 3719.559
they're so

3717.039 --> 3722.48
brazen they and they are

3719.559 --> 3724.6400000000003
demoralizing but at the same time those

3722.48 --> 3727.44
that will not be demoralized will be

3724.64 --> 3729.839
grossly offended and they will just it's

3727.44 --> 3731.76
just like this is an atrocity this is

3729.839 --> 3732.96
evil this must be stopped

3731.76 --> 3736.0
so they are

3732.96 --> 3740.319
to the light directly communicating just

3736.0 --> 3742.4
stop us stop us please stop us please

3740.319 --> 3744.799
it hurts

3742.4 --> 3746.48
it hurts and we can't even express the

3744.799 --> 3749.7599999999998
feelings anymore

3746.48 --> 3752.319
we can only express this hatred this

3749.76 --> 3752.3190000000004
defense

3752.88 --> 3759.2000000000003
this keeping everything out because it

3755.359 --> 3759.2
hurts so much please stop us

3764.4 --> 3767.799
it's like hysterical

3772.0 --> 3775.28
but not there no

3773.599 --> 3777.44
i'm not saying it's from their

3775.28 --> 3779.52
perspective it's not their conscious

3777.44 --> 3781.52
perspe they don't have that anymore

3779.52 --> 3783.7599999999998
gorzella

3781.52 --> 3786.319
it's not there anymore

3783.76 --> 3789.3590000000004
they sacrificed it all but that doesn't

3786.319 --> 3792.0
mean that it is effectively that

3789.359 --> 3794.0789999999997
that's what i'm not talking about their

3792.0 --> 3797.839
perspective their con dude their

3794.079 --> 3797.8390000000004
consciousness is just

3798.24 --> 3802.799
gear just thinking like

3800.559 --> 3804.2400000000002
win we have to win this we have to win

3802.799 --> 3807.52
that oh

3804.24 --> 3809.68
how to not go crazy under the punishment

3807.52 --> 3810.88
of realization of what we're actually

3809.68 --> 3813.359
doing

3810.88 --> 3815.52
just win when we have to win this like

3813.359 --> 3818.48
we got to do whatever is necessary but

3815.52 --> 3818.48
it's pure hell

3820.48 --> 3826.799
and what it effectively comes down to

3823.599 --> 3828.96
effectively out there is

3826.799 --> 3830.72
they're just like hi

3828.96 --> 3832.799
i'm an evil wizard

3830.72 --> 3834.72
i'm manipulating the [ __ ] see look

3832.799 --> 3836.559
here's the leverages look at that see i

3834.72 --> 3838.8799999999997
switched his leverage and suddenly the

3836.559 --> 3840.799
big monster goes

3838.88 --> 3843.76
look at this look at how we're doing it

3840.799 --> 3843.7599999999998
we're so powerful

3843.92 --> 3848.64
please stop us i'm stuck behind this

3846.16 --> 3851.52
stupid little curtain my entire life i

3848.64 --> 3853.7599999999998
want out of this please

3851.52 --> 3853.7599999999998
this

3873.839 --> 3876.839
so

3896.559 --> 3898.799
all right

3899.68 --> 3907.1189999999997
you have to realize if there is no part

3903.119 --> 3910.079
of them that is still good inside locked

3907.119 --> 3911.92
in a cage never to be able to come out

3910.079 --> 3914.0
then there would and if they wouldn't

3911.92 --> 3917.839
experience no torture then they would

3914.0 --> 3920.319
not be able to really do what they do

3917.839 --> 3923.119
so there is this part of them always on

3920.319 --> 3925.7599999999998
the inside never showing screaming it's

3923.119 --> 3927.599
the conflict this was expressed in star

3925.76 --> 3928.6400000000003
wars it's there

3927.599 --> 3931.3590000000004
it's just

3928.64 --> 3935.2799999999997
completely unreachable

3931.359 --> 3938.24
but it is there you should know it is

3935.28 --> 3940.0
there no matter how locked away it seems

3938.24 --> 3942.319
doesn't mean that you could just pull it

3940.0 --> 3944.72
out just work with that no but it is

3942.319 --> 3945.52
there it's good to know it's there and

3944.72 --> 3947.52
that

3945.52 --> 3950.079
everything they are

3947.52 --> 3954.0
like the darth vader everything it is is

3950.079 --> 3956.4
to conceal that part

3954.0 --> 3956.4
you see

3957.2 --> 3962.16
but it's there

3959.599 --> 3964.2400000000002
they suffer

3962.16 --> 3967.5589999999997
doesn't exist there's no power without

3964.24 --> 3967.5589999999997
that suffering

3983.52 --> 3988.079
right if there's no actual suffering no

3986.48 --> 3990.16
thing that hurts

3988.079 --> 3993.76
because it reminds you exactly of what

3990.16 --> 3996.799
is wrong what is right in the end

3993.76 --> 3998.079
then you have no grip over reality and

3996.799 --> 4000.48
then you

3998.079 --> 4002.2400000000002
literally like a soulless thing just

4000.48 --> 4006.2
everything just starts to crumble around

4002.24 --> 4006.2
you including power

4007.039 --> 4012.2400000000002
it has to be in there or it can't work

4010.24 --> 4014.319
this is all

4012.24 --> 4016.799
very

4014.319 --> 4019.2
very esoteric

4016.799 --> 4022.319
very metaphysical well it's not

4019.2 --> 4026.52
metaphase esoteric this is just like how

4022.319 --> 4026.52
does it really work inside

4045.039 --> 4049.039
revelation is this awake and fursuit

4047.039 --> 4051.5200000000004
will never awake well if you don't

4049.039 --> 4054.7200000000003
awaken you die

4051.52 --> 4057.92
absolutely it's written it's

4054.72 --> 4062.3999999999996
it's right there you can already see how

4057.92 --> 4065.039
if you don't awaken in this time you die

4062.4 --> 4065.039
die out

4065.92 --> 4071.88
and if you're unlucky or pull everybody

4068.24 --> 4071.8799999999997
you know with you

4094.799 --> 4098.96
yeah

4096.239 --> 4101.3589999999995
it absolutely lets author authorize

4098.96 --> 4105.839
vaccines for children that'll upset them

4101.359 --> 4105.839
the grappler exactly you get it

4107.44 --> 4111.44
see and now it all comes back to full

4109.839 --> 4113.839
circle

4111.44 --> 4115.599999999999
now all these icons that we've kind of

4113.839 --> 4118.3189999999995
got to know

4115.6 --> 4121.679
suddenly placed in a much deeper much

4118.319 --> 4123.359
more serious context

4121.679 --> 4125.759
and it all works

4123.359 --> 4127.839
separately and together it works because

4125.759 --> 4130.88
it's real

4127.839 --> 4133.839
the grabbler icon is real it's a real

4130.88 --> 4133.839
thing

4140.719 --> 4146.4
and so is the torture inside of a

4143.92 --> 4149.04
evil powerful person

4146.4 --> 4151.759
no no torture no grip

4149.04 --> 4155.04
they don't have that pain

4151.759 --> 4156.799
then they literally lose their mind

4155.04 --> 4158.839
their grip

4156.799 --> 4162.88
this is

4158.839 --> 4162.88
complicated spiritual stuff

4164.88 --> 4168.2390000000005
sleeper must awaken

4173.839 --> 4178.3189999999995
right

4174.64 --> 4178.319
but you know tobinoy that

4178.48 --> 4183.199
the spice is dangerous

4181.279 --> 4184.88
right

4183.199 --> 4187.3589999999995
when you get

4184.88 --> 4188.64
psionic and you get telepathic and all

4187.359 --> 4191.04
that

4188.64 --> 4193.759
get contact with the other dimension

4191.04 --> 4197.679
they don't call it that here

4193.759 --> 4198.88
then if you can't handle it you destroy

4197.679 --> 4201.4400000000005
yourself

4198.88 --> 4203.6
that's even set in that major awakening

4201.44 --> 4206.48
ritual where they have to drink the

4203.6 --> 4206.4800000000005
the water alive

4207.44 --> 4211.36
everybody that has ever even tried that

4209.52 --> 4213.120000000001
died

4211.36 --> 4215.92
according to their legend but there

4213.12 --> 4218.239
would be one that did would do it and

4215.92 --> 4220.08
paula tradies would be that one and he

4218.239 --> 4222.08
did it and he could handle it and now he

4220.08 --> 4225.28
could look

4222.08 --> 4226.48
where the benej was afraid

4225.28 --> 4231.8
to see

4226.48 --> 4231.799999999999
and stare right back at him from there

4244.48 --> 4250.5599999999995
i thought this voice was just worm poop

4248.56 --> 4253.6
yeah well even worm poop is quite

4250.56 --> 4255.1990000000005
magnificent substance right here regular

4253.6 --> 4257.1990000000005
worms

4255.199 --> 4261.28
you know that what they pull out

4257.199 --> 4262.5599999999995
literally makes for the most fertile

4261.28 --> 4266.28
product

4262.56 --> 4266.280000000001
soil could have

4273.28 --> 4277.5599999999995
worms are very precious creatures

4287.92 --> 4293.08
like the vegetarian ones that is

4310.0 --> 4313.32
ah godzilla

4314.4 --> 4317.4
what

4332.88 --> 4339.08
yeah yeah that's good

4335.04 --> 4339.08
good working gunny bear

4348.719 --> 4352.159
all right be back two minutes

4352.64 --> 4356.84
oh god stop yapping

4380.4 --> 4383.4
bye

4452.84 --> 4459.1990000000005
huh oh by the way just for the record

4456.08 --> 4461.04
the spice from june it's supposed to be

4459.199 --> 4464.04
tasting like cinnamon

4461.04 --> 4464.04
really

4468.159 --> 4474.799999999999
owen's keanu take was awesome gravy it's

4471.6 --> 4476.96
very fascinating clutch

4474.8 --> 4479.679
i do have a couple of things to say

4476.96 --> 4479.679
about it though

4480.08 --> 4483.84
because

4481.199 --> 4483.839999999999
but

4489.04 --> 4493.44
i i really wonder like if keanu actually

4491.84 --> 4494.719
appreciates

4493.44 --> 4497.839999999999
the joke

4494.719 --> 4500.56
or if he just ignores it because i think

4497.84 --> 4502.8
i think keanu like has depression issues

4500.56 --> 4505.92
like serious ones

4502.8 --> 4507.92
and probably routed in the abuse

4505.92 --> 4510.08
that was also mentioned

4507.92 --> 4512.8
and i think he's like psychologically

4510.08 --> 4512.8
taken on

4515.28 --> 4519.5199999999995
well

4517.199 --> 4521.759999999999
sort of lesbianism

4519.52 --> 4523.120000000001
but it's psychological

4521.76 --> 4525.12
purely

4523.12 --> 4528.5599999999995
i don't think he is

4525.12 --> 4530.88
i think he is born a man

4528.56 --> 4535.400000000001
but i'm i can't be a hundred percent

4530.88 --> 4535.400000000001
sure but i guess that's part of the joke

4540.56 --> 4546.719
but i i really think that he's just like

4543.92 --> 4549.52
well like i get like wonky

4546.719 --> 4551.92
and he has it bad and it probably lasts

4549.52 --> 4554.159000000001
very long and then he just like becomes

4551.92 --> 4556.4800000000005
fragile and he's like okay just

4554.159 --> 4558.799999999999
braid my hair just

4556.48 --> 4561.36
so i could see myself in the mirror and

4558.8 --> 4563.52
at least giggle for a bit because like

4561.36 --> 4565.36
that's what serious depression can do

4563.52 --> 4567.76
that to you like

4565.36 --> 4569.36
sounds a bit weird maybe but i've had

4567.76 --> 4571.360000000001
those types of

4569.36 --> 4573.5199999999995
times

4571.36 --> 4575.36
where i would be like really

4573.52 --> 4577.4400000000005
depressed

4575.36 --> 4581.44
and like didn't have a grip and i would

4577.44 --> 4583.678999999999
just do weird things not creepy

4581.44 --> 4585.759999999999
but weird

4583.679 --> 4586.56
clownish

4585.76 --> 4587.92
just

4586.56 --> 4590.96
so i could

4587.92 --> 4594.08
sort of force myself to smile because

4590.96 --> 4597.28
that's what i was like it wouldn't work

4594.08 --> 4599.84
right and keanu is very he's a very

4597.28 --> 4601.679
stoic guy and i think he has problems

4599.84 --> 4603.52
with

4601.679 --> 4605.36
well depression

4603.52 --> 4607.120000000001
and i think that even gets in the way of

4605.36 --> 4608.88
his acting

4607.12 --> 4612.4
that he's not

4608.88 --> 4614.8
into the role well enough

4612.4 --> 4615.599999999999
because he can't

4614.8 --> 4618.159000000001
he

4615.6 --> 4621.280000000001
can't get it out because it's depressed

4618.159 --> 4624.159
i think he has depression issues

4621.28 --> 4625.5199999999995
and i really hope

4624.159 --> 4627.759999999999
well

4625.52 --> 4627.76
he's

4628.0 --> 4631.28
he's like

4629.04 --> 4633.44
yeah how old is he now

4631.28 --> 4636.44
right so he just that's just what he's

4633.44 --> 4636.44
become

4642.4 --> 4647.28
but i think that ohm benjamin's take on

4644.719 --> 4649.679
it is very funny though and i hope that

4647.28 --> 4653.04
keanu can actually appreciate that for

4649.679 --> 4653.04
the joke that it really is

4657.12 --> 4663.76
oh by the way thank you godzilla for the

4660.4 --> 4666.239
5 canadian dollar super chat donation

4663.76 --> 4668.159000000001
what you do are we may go unnoticed by

4666.239 --> 4670.32
the majority of the world

4668.159 --> 4673.04
but like the truth itself popularity

4670.32 --> 4676.799999999999
means nothing truth still prevails right

4673.04 --> 4680.32
because it is the truth is

4676.8 --> 4680.320000000001
and it doesn't matter when it's

4680.719 --> 4684.4800000000005
taken out of the ground and put on top

4682.56 --> 4688.0
of the table to look at

4684.48 --> 4690.959999999999
it's there and even if the table goes

4688.0 --> 4693.92
is burned and people go away it'll sink

4690.96 --> 4698.32
back in it's going to be found again

4693.92 --> 4698.32
people the truth is there to be found

4698.96 --> 4705.04
and like that

4701.44 --> 4707.04
i like to dig up gems really early when

4705.04 --> 4709.12
people are still preoccupied with

4707.04 --> 4711.199
building their stuff and their community

4709.12 --> 4712.48
and their concept and their narrative

4711.199 --> 4714.96
i'm like

4712.48 --> 4717.678999999999
okay well everybody's occupied with that

4714.96 --> 4719.6
let me quickly dig here

4717.679 --> 4721.1990000000005
look what i got

4719.6 --> 4722.96
you're going to stumble on this like in

4721.199 --> 4725.12
a few months

4722.96 --> 4728.4
and i don't even like

4725.12 --> 4731.04
oh look at me i am the no no i'm just

4728.4 --> 4733.28
like mentioning it once or twice and

4731.04 --> 4735.679
then just seeing like are people picking

4733.28 --> 4737.44
up on what i just did are they still too

4735.679 --> 4741.04
preoccupied

4737.44 --> 4743.839999999999
with like the current time event

4741.04 --> 4747.88
that's what i like to do

4743.84 --> 4747.88
i'm really good at it

4750.159 --> 4753.839999999999
yeah

4751.04 --> 4756.0
i dig up things too soon

4753.84 --> 4759.04
and the weird thing is unlike a lot of

4756.0 --> 4760.56
other people i don't even like oh i'm

4759.04 --> 4761.76
gonna do some

4760.56 --> 4766.0
eight

4761.76 --> 4768.159000000001
reading up of documents and websites and

4766.0 --> 4768.159
no

4768.48 --> 4773.04
nothing

4770.56 --> 4774.84
nothing

4773.04 --> 4780.08
it's

4774.84 --> 4784.32
magic it's right there it's right there

4780.08 --> 4784.32
don't have to do anything

4786.719 --> 4791.199
it's god's gift

4788.8 --> 4794.4800000000005
and i have the unique talent to do it

4791.199 --> 4795.719
and the unique opportunity to do it

4794.48 --> 4797.919999999999
being as

4795.719 --> 4800.88
unentangled as i am

4797.92 --> 4800.88
with society

4801.12 --> 4804.4
because there's nothing holding me back

4802.88 --> 4809.32
i have no

4804.4 --> 4809.32
objections to just doing it

4836.4 --> 4841.679

brilliant individuals out there

4884.32 --> 4890.159

4901.04 --> 4904.159
didn't realize it

4905.28 --> 4910.0
he got spellbound

4908.08 --> 4912.8
it's very tragic

4910.0 --> 4915.8
it didn't need to happen but he got

4912.8 --> 4915.8
spellbound

4916.56 --> 4921.120000000001
he did not die from sea

4922.08 --> 4926.08
nobody dies from that you die from the

4924.48 --> 4926.879999999999
procedures

4926.08 --> 4928.8
that

4926.88 --> 4931.6
overcome you

4928.8 --> 4935.12
when with that condition because it's a

4931.6 --> 4937.120000000001
condition it's not a v it's a condition

4935.12 --> 4938.48
when you go into a hospital with that

4937.12 --> 4939.599999999999
condition

4938.48 --> 4942.08
they

4939.6 --> 4943.4400000000005
unleash procedures onto you

4942.08 --> 4945.679
that are

4943.44 --> 4948.638999999999
not going to help you restore

4945.679 --> 4949.6
and that in most cases end up killing

4948.639 --> 4951.92
you

4949.6 --> 4954.400000000001
yeah that's what happened to him he was

4951.92 --> 4954.4
murdered

4956.0 --> 4961.6
now outrage for me go squirt for me

4960.239 --> 4964.5599999999995
i don't care

4961.6 --> 4966.2390000000005
this is the truth

4964.56 --> 4968.88
i don't know if

4966.239 --> 4971.28
his family feels like that or if they

4968.88 --> 4974.56
just want to leave it alone probably

4971.28 --> 4974.5599999999995
wanna just leave it alone

4974.8 --> 4980.400000000001
i'm not gonna be like oh i am going to

4977.52 --> 4982.4800000000005
sue or no that's not what i do but i

4980.4 --> 4986.679
will point out exactly what it is and

4982.48 --> 4986.678999999999
that i know what it is

4990.48 --> 4995.759999999999
as a good guy a good sensitive guy

4994.239 --> 4999.28
not perfect

4995.76 --> 5001.84
and he perished under a hostile medical

4999.28 --> 5001.84
system

5010.96 --> 5014.4
medical protocols are not for that

5012.56 --> 5015.84
depends on the protocol seeking style

5014.4 --> 5018.879999999999
waters these

5015.84 --> 5020.56
the sea protocols specifically

5018.88 --> 5024.32
are not for your health there are other

5020.56 --> 5026.56
protocols that are fine

5024.32 --> 5027.84
problem is is there's a lot of protocols

5026.56 --> 5030.56
and

5027.84 --> 5032.0
not everybody in the medical system even

5030.56 --> 5034.96
knows

5032.0 --> 5038.639
why those protocols are there

5034.96 --> 5038.639
that's kind of a bigger problem

5038.719 --> 5045.04
you see the whole allopathic medical

5041.199 --> 5045.04
industry has become so

5045.44 --> 5049.28
big

5047.679 --> 5051.52
that it's kind of like becoming

5049.28 --> 5054.719
incohesive like

5051.52 --> 5056.96
if somebody in that system is smart

5054.719 --> 5059.84
enough brilliant enough to literally

5056.96 --> 5061.6
grasp all of it all the procedure like

5059.84 --> 5062.96
knows it all all the protocols all the

5061.6 --> 5066.08
procedures

5062.96 --> 5068.88
then they will know it's not cohesive it

5066.08 --> 5071.44
doesn't make any freaking sense it's

5068.88 --> 5074.08
based on like temporary decision making

5071.44 --> 5076.0
logic it could work

5074.08 --> 5078.0
but when you put it all together then it

5076.0 --> 5079.12
doesn't work

5078.0 --> 5082.4
it's all

5079.12 --> 5085.36
like a giant amount of temporary

5082.4 --> 5086.48
emergency procedures and such

5085.36 --> 5090.5599999999995
and

5086.48 --> 5090.5599999999995
a lot of it doesn't actually work

5092.0 --> 5096.159
and there's a lot that could be

5094.32 --> 5098.5599999999995
improved upon it

5096.159 --> 5100.32
but probably a lot of it has to just be

5098.56 --> 5103.679
replaced and discarded because it's

5100.32 --> 5105.759999999999
completely superfluous and unnecessary

5103.679 --> 5108.88
there's much more efficient

5105.76 --> 5110.2390000000005
cheaper oh no not cheap medical things

5108.88 --> 5112.719
oh my god no

5110.239 --> 5114.799999999999
yeah it's there it's been discovered

5112.719 --> 5118.4800000000005
it's out there it's been

5114.8 --> 5120.88
banned persecuted sued

5118.48 --> 5121.919999999999
it works there's many things that really

5120.88 --> 5123.92
do work

5121.92 --> 5128.0
and there should be freedom to just do

5123.92 --> 5130.08
that completely and no censorship

5128.0 --> 5132.8
and then yeah if there's some

5130.08 --> 5133.84
doctors that get all fouchy on you

5132.8 --> 5136.08
that get

5133.84 --> 5137.6
with another type of thing not the v

5136.08 --> 5138.8
thing

5137.6 --> 5141.120000000001
and they're like oh i got this

5138.8 --> 5143.6
alternative therapy and then yeah peer

5141.12 --> 5145.679
review people can get look into it and

5143.6 --> 5147.280000000001
basically say okay this is what i think

5145.679 --> 5150.0
this is

5147.28 --> 5152.48
this is the data this is my conclusion

5150.0 --> 5155.44
and it's up to the people

5152.48 --> 5157.919999999999
to figure it out and yeah there will be

5155.44 --> 5159.5199999999995
evil doctors coming out of that that

5157.92 --> 5161.92
will

5159.52 --> 5164.56
get people pulled in and probably get

5161.92 --> 5166.96
them killed or whatever

5164.56 --> 5170.4800000000005
that's always going to happen

5166.96 --> 5172.88
but at least it's not the universal

5170.48 --> 5174.799999999999
standardized system that's doing that

5172.88 --> 5176.2390000000005
how about that

5174.8 --> 5179.1990000000005
right that's

5176.239 --> 5180.4
the real problem

5179.199 --> 5182.4
if it's all

5180.4 --> 5185.36
individual doctors

5182.4 --> 5188.799999999999
doing things doing their own thing

5185.36 --> 5191.759999999999
then they can develop their own thing

5188.8 --> 5193.04
and then there is like a free market

5191.76 --> 5194.4800000000005
effect for

5193.04 --> 5196.639
health care

5194.48 --> 5198.799999999999
and people will just be able to pick out

5196.639 --> 5200.08
like i like this i like that

5198.8 --> 5204.400000000001
and then

5200.08 --> 5206.239
different doctors start to adapt adopt

5204.4 --> 5209.28
different methods

5206.239 --> 5211.599999999999
and then it's just like okay well

5209.28 --> 5214.0
this is what i need that that's who i'm

5211.6 --> 5216.08
going to go to

5214.0 --> 5219.08
it's very simple

5216.08 --> 5219.08
decentralized

5225.44 --> 5230.239
yeah that's right wesley share

5228.159 --> 5233.12
rockefeller foundation yeah he the

5230.239 --> 5236.4
standardization allopathic medicine

5233.12 --> 5236.4
that's where it all started

5236.8 --> 5241.12
that's where it started to get

5238.719 --> 5244.96
seriously bad that's when the

5241.12 --> 5247.199
eugenics operation started to really

5244.96 --> 5248.639
like hit society

5247.199 --> 5250.719
because that's what it was used for

5248.639 --> 5253.679
that's probably why they created it in

5250.719 --> 5255.679
the first place it's like oh universal

5253.679 --> 5256.8
medical system what are we going to do

5255.679 --> 5259.04
with that

5256.8 --> 5259.84
kill as much people as we can of course

5259.04 --> 5262.239
and

5259.84 --> 5264.4800000000005
let make sure they don't catch on for as

5262.239 --> 5268.0
long as possible

5264.48 --> 5269.678999999999
and we can just literally just trim

5268.0 --> 5272.56
the grass

5269.679 --> 5275.12
like we wanted

5272.56 --> 5278.400000000001
that's why they made that

5275.12 --> 5278.4
not for our benefit

5279.44 --> 5283.04
look at all the

5281.199 --> 5285.919999999999
like the good

5283.04 --> 5290.0
almost like shaman type

5285.92 --> 5290.0
unique doctors that have just been

5290.56 --> 5293.280000000001
yeah

5291.36 --> 5295.599999999999
robbed

5293.28 --> 5296.8
pushed aside

5295.6 --> 5298.88
destroyed

5296.8 --> 5302.08
because of the

5298.88 --> 5303.52
medical mainstream system

5302.08 --> 5306.5199999999995
that came out of the rockefeller

5303.52 --> 5306.52
foundation

5309.199 --> 5313.839999999999
slander propaganda oh something

5311.679 --> 5316.32
alternative how dare you do something

5313.84 --> 5319.12
alternative for cancer i still remember

5316.32 --> 5321.04
though there was a whole slanderous

5319.12 --> 5323.84
item on the news

5321.04 --> 5325.5199999999995
in the 90s about this person

5323.84 --> 5326.639
famous in the netherlands who died from

5325.52 --> 5329.360000000001
cancer

5326.639 --> 5332.4800000000005
because she got alternative treatment oh

5329.36 --> 5335.12
we never got stopped having that shoved

5332.48 --> 5337.839999999999
in our face about how bad alternative

5335.12 --> 5340.0
medicine was oh my god it kills people

5337.84 --> 5342.96
like slander

5340.0 --> 5344.239
really bad slander

5342.96 --> 5346.4800000000005
right because

5344.239 --> 5348.5599999999995
it would like yeah that person might

5346.48 --> 5350.48
have actually just

5348.56 --> 5353.04
been um improperly

5350.48 --> 5355.12
treated like ineffectively

5353.04 --> 5357.92
it's their choice though

5355.12 --> 5360.0
and that's just one person that does

5357.92 --> 5361.92
like faith healing or something was it i

5360.0 --> 5364.96
don't remember exactly

5361.92 --> 5367.84
but they slept they put that mark and

5364.96 --> 5371.12
put it on everything they put it on

5367.84 --> 5373.04
every alternative thing they slandered

5371.12 --> 5376.239
everything with it they attacked

5373.04 --> 5380.08
alternative medicine with that thing

5376.239 --> 5382.718999999999
through media a conspiracy to slander

5380.08 --> 5385.5199999999995
and destroy alternative health

5382.719 --> 5385.52
practitioners

5385.679 --> 5390.88
that was very serious

5388.88 --> 5392.88
it's all coming out of that same

5390.88 --> 5395.76
mechanism the system

5392.88 --> 5395.76
take control

5395.84 --> 5399.92
standardize

5397.76 --> 5403.6
and euthanize

5399.92 --> 5403.6
without even telling the people

5403.76 --> 5407.320000000001
it needs to stop

5421.76 --> 5428.320000000001
just to destroy homeopathy

5425.6 --> 5430.159000000001
well classical homeopath

5428.32 --> 5433.04
among other things

5430.159 --> 5435.679
but homeopathy is really

5433.04 --> 5439.44
in my opinion and i'm not poo pooing it

5435.679 --> 5441.92
too much but it's among alternative

5439.44 --> 5444.5599999999995
medical systems

5441.92 --> 5446.32
it's one of the least effective it still

5444.56 --> 5448.8
can work though

5446.32 --> 5450.239
but there's it's like one

5448.8 --> 5451.679
one thing

5450.239 --> 5456.799999999999
and there's like

5451.679 --> 5460.4800000000005
hundreds of completely effective unique

5456.8 --> 5462.56
approaches out there for so many things

5460.48 --> 5465.678999999999
it's just one thing

5462.56 --> 5469.4400000000005
to destroy homeopathy no i think

5465.679 --> 5471.76
homeopathy has been actually used

5469.44 --> 5473.919999999999
to put

5471.76 --> 5476.320000000001
in the attention as a controlled

5473.92 --> 5479.28
opposition it's like this is the

5476.32 --> 5481.36
dangerous alternative medicine

5479.28 --> 5483.759999999999
right because that's the first thing

5481.36 --> 5485.839999999999
that people will then start looking at

5483.76 --> 5488.719
as an alternative when they don't trust

5485.84 --> 5489.52
the mainstream medical system anymore

5488.719 --> 5492.4800000000005
but

5489.52 --> 5494.400000000001
it's not the most effective there's many

5492.48 --> 5497.599999999999
other things out there that never get a

5494.4 --> 5501.04
mention they get censorship

5497.6 --> 5504.4800000000005
right i think homeopathy was actually

5501.04 --> 5506.719
put like in the pit of the attention of

5504.48 --> 5509.44
the mainstream as a controlled

5506.719 --> 5511.44
opposition to allopathic medicine that's

5509.44 --> 5514.0
what i think happened does it mean that

5511.44 --> 5515.5199999999995
it's completely ineffective

5514.0 --> 5518.159
yeah it can

5515.52 --> 5520.8
i've seen the the results of it i think

5518.159 --> 5520.799999999999
it can work

5521.52 --> 5525.76
i'm just saying it was

5524.0 --> 5527.28
put into the

5525.76 --> 5528.88
attention

5527.28 --> 5530.239
the mainstream

5528.88 --> 5532.4800000000005
in a pit

5530.239 --> 5536.4
as a controlled opposition because there

5532.48 --> 5538.718999999999
were many other things already back then

5536.4 --> 5542.799999999999
like the gerson therapy dude that was

5538.719 --> 5544.8
like early 20th century like very early

5542.8 --> 5547.84
gerson was out there figuring out like

5544.8 --> 5549.76
how diet affected your health and how

5547.84 --> 5551.84
you could literally cure

5549.76 --> 5554.0
malignant tumors and

5551.84 --> 5556.719
toxic conditions through

5554.0 --> 5560.88
very strict raw dieting and all that

5556.719 --> 5562.0
fast that was early 20th century

5560.88 --> 5566.88
early

5562.0 --> 5569.28
very very early before world war ii okay

5566.88 --> 5572.0
did that get a mention did gerson get a

5569.28 --> 5573.44
mansion oh look at the battle no no it

5572.0 --> 5575.36
didn't

5573.44 --> 5577.678999999999
because it was actually really good it

5575.36 --> 5580.88
still is there's a gerson institute in

5577.679 --> 5580.88
mexico did you know that

5581.12 --> 5584.679
they heal people

5593.92 --> 5600.0
yeah

5595.92 --> 5603.679
it's just one thing right the cannabis

5600.0 --> 5607.92
things that can do it's amazing

5603.679 --> 5607.92
then there is the direction of the the

5608.56 --> 5613.120000000001
the turpentine detoxification there's

5611.44 --> 5615.44
many different

5613.12 --> 5617.76
ways to approach that

5615.44 --> 5620.32
but it is very

5617.76 --> 5624.320000000001
rigorously effective and fascinating and

5620.32 --> 5626.5599999999995
it's very very alternative

5624.32 --> 5630.08
that was also already known that was

5626.56 --> 5633.92
already standard before the allopathic

5630.08 --> 5633.92
medical system like got in the way

5637.12 --> 5641.04
there's so many alternative things other

5639.84 --> 5643.84
than

5641.04 --> 5647.04
homeopathy but they part

5643.84 --> 5649.52
specifically put that in the pit as the

5647.04 --> 5651.679
bad man alternative

5649.52 --> 5654.320000000001
to make everybody think that that was

5651.679 --> 5656.159
like the only alternative so that when

5654.32 --> 5658.48
they were dissatisfied with the medical

5656.159 --> 5661.04
system or in protest of how things go

5658.48 --> 5662.799999999999
about they would go to homeopathy

5661.04 --> 5665.679
specifically

5662.8 --> 5669.04
because among all the things out there

5665.679 --> 5670.2390000000005
as alternative medical systems and

5669.04 --> 5672.96
procedures

5670.239 --> 5677.12
things you could do

5672.96 --> 5677.12
it was probably the least effective

5679.52 --> 5683.8
not saying it is completely ineffective

5691.44 --> 5694.44
so

5720.639 --> 5724.639
right anyway it's been pretty intense

5722.639 --> 5727.6
show today

5724.639 --> 5728.56
it's a lot of information

5727.6 --> 5730.56
came

5728.56 --> 5733.04
passing through me today

5730.56 --> 5733.04
it's good

5733.36 --> 5737.759999999999
i like it

5734.8 --> 5737.76
didn't expect that

5738.0 --> 5742.8
but maybe i am getting really out of the

5740.56 --> 5745.8
wonky phase now

5742.8 --> 5745.8
finally

5765.52 --> 5771.2390000000005
anyway i hope you guys appreciated it

5768.239 --> 5771.239
also

5771.84 --> 5774.639
you probably have

5778.719 --> 5783.2390000000005
because i think i'm gonna run out the

5780.239 --> 5783.239
show

5798.8 --> 5804.4800000000005
yeah thanks loma moonbug and by the way

5801.28 --> 5806.88

5832.88 --> 5838.08
it's just goofing around i don't like

5835.119 --> 5841.44
that i want the energy to be thick and

5838.08 --> 5843.36
rife and of course there's time to joke

5841.44 --> 5847.119
around a little

5843.36 --> 5852.28
but not to distract

5847.119 --> 5852.28
but to just like top it off you know

if he's actu if he's just trying to make

5947.44 --> 5953.44
me work for him

5949.52 --> 5956.0
or whether he actually means that

5953.44 --> 5958.32
but i don't see any reason why he

5956.0 --> 5960.32
shouldn't be able to be part of the chat

5958.32 --> 5961.92
i mean unless he starts misbehaving and

5960.32 --> 5965.04
then yeah that's

5961.92 --> 5967.76
