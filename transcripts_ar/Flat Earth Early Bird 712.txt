76.08 --> 82.479
so it's friday

79.36 --> 86.0
and yeah very similar weather

82.479 --> 88.64
to yesterday except

86.0 --> 90.4
there's some trails going on like i

88.64 --> 92.32000000000001
haven't

90.4 --> 93.92
even noticed that i haven't even

92.32 --> 97.439
addressed anything like that

93.92 --> 100.56
in weeks but this morning it was very

97.439 --> 103.6
visible that there were planes up there

100.56 --> 108.24000000000001
and they were leaving stuff behind now

103.6 --> 111.6
and so it's yeah

108.24 --> 115.759
this weird white sand

111.6 --> 118.32
dune like rippling haze up there

115.759 --> 118.96
and there's still stuff being sprayed

118.32 --> 120.96
even

118.96 --> 123.83999999999999
on camera but yeah you might not be able

120.96 --> 126.399
to pick it up with the camera

123.84 --> 128.0
but yeah kind of too bad and it also

126.399 --> 131.84
makes it even colder

128.0 --> 135.92
i have to say that because i don't know

131.84 --> 135.92000000000002
it does block the sun i think somewhat

141.44 --> 145.68
so i don't know where that's gonna go

144.0 --> 146.879
maybe they're trying to make some rain

145.68 --> 150.56
or something again

146.879 --> 153.92
because it has been a pretty cold night

150.56 --> 158.31900000000002
there's no wind or uh there's no

153.92 --> 158.319
clouds at night and becomes very clear

159.04 --> 161.92
then yeah

164.879 --> 168.48
hasn't still hasn't really frozen yet

167.28 --> 171.28
though

168.48 --> 173.67999999999998
something that stood out to me right

171.28 --> 173.68
anyway

173.76 --> 180.64
uh good sermon was first

176.879 --> 186.159
brand m here we go again

180.64 --> 186.159
matrix media good to see you so far

186.879 --> 195.60999999999999
yeah it's good to start in time

192.57 --> 195.60999999999999
[Music]

197.04 --> 204.319
global dimming yeah that something

202.319 --> 207.28
it just stood out that nothing really

204.319 --> 207.28
happened for so long

211.68 --> 217.04000000000002
but yeah i guess it's continuing

214.799 --> 218.87900000000002
the program now whatever it's gonna lead

217.04 --> 222.64
to

218.879 --> 225.92
uh right

222.64 --> 229.67999999999998
oh god did i make any notes yesterday

225.92 --> 232.23899999999998
nope i did not

229.68 --> 232.239
stupid

237.439 --> 242.07999999999998
right i remember yeah i had an absurdly

240.319 --> 243.439
long call with a friend of mine i think

242.08 --> 243.92000000000002
that's why i didn't make any notes

243.439 --> 245.76
because

243.92 --> 247.83999999999997
pretty much the entire evening was

245.76 --> 250.879
having her on the phone

247.84 --> 253.519
it's like three and a half hours

250.879 --> 254.959
but she had a lot on her on her heart

253.519 --> 256.56
and on her mind and

254.959 --> 257.919
i guess it's the time of the year it's

256.56 --> 260.799
kind of the same thing that happened

257.919 --> 264.639
with my dad's like unusual

260.799 --> 266.79999999999995
usual amount of connecting

264.639 --> 269.84000000000003
a lot of stuff on the move mentally and

266.8 --> 269.84000000000003
yeah she had that too

270.08 --> 276.32
a lot of it like even

273.6 --> 278.72
like she usually doesn't do that but

276.32 --> 281.28
like pronounced judgments

278.72 --> 282.0
for people like making decisions on what

281.28 --> 283.52
to do with what

282.0 --> 285.28
them with the long run is very

283.52 --> 287.75899999999996
impressive you know to hear them

285.28 --> 290.0
basically

287.759 --> 291.04
yeah i can't say it any other way whine

290.0 --> 293.199
about other people

291.04 --> 294.56
but that's what everybody does sometimes

293.199 --> 296.479
you know

294.56 --> 297.84
they need to get that off their chest

296.479 --> 301.28
and kind of give it a place so

297.84 --> 302.63899999999995
yeah this is that's all part of social

301.28 --> 306.0
life

302.639 --> 309.36
but to then certainly hear them really

306.0 --> 312.4
know what to do with that also also she

309.36 --> 314.47900000000004
had it has a date today apparently with

312.4 --> 317.84
some new guy

314.479 --> 325.84
so yeah

317.84 --> 325.84
she's she's moving

329.039 --> 334.4
and yeah like

332.24 --> 336.08
in a way i hope that she's gonna just

334.4 --> 339.28
find the right type of guy

336.08 --> 341.919
because i'm not really that either

339.28 --> 343.67999999999995
i think like we're just too good friends

341.919 --> 348.15999999999997
to ever

343.68 --> 348.16
you know to do that again

348.4 --> 353.28
and yeah i just really hope she's gonna

351.12 --> 354.479
find just the right guy that's gonna

353.28 --> 358.15999999999997
really be able to

354.479 --> 361.75899999999996
play into how she's growing and then

358.16 --> 365.03900000000004
like maybe be a little yeah be

361.759 --> 368.16
a halfway decent stepfather or something

365.039 --> 372.479
to her kid because this dad guy is just

368.16 --> 374.8
[ __ ] insane just keeps on like she

372.479 --> 376.96
she's just trying to be honest and not

374.8 --> 377.759
judgmental but really the conclusion is

376.96 --> 380.79999999999995
he's [ __ ]

377.759 --> 382.40000000000003
insane like really and that he even

380.8 --> 385.44
reflects on the kid because

382.4 --> 388.23999999999995
yeah he does get her with him and now

385.44 --> 389.759
she does he doesn't like physically

388.24 --> 393.84000000000003
abuse or anything

389.759 --> 397.12
but he's always so rambling and out of

393.84 --> 398.56
yeah in always stressed stressed out and

397.12 --> 400.8
complaining just

398.56 --> 402.0
think about online trolls but then in

400.8 --> 405.12
real life now this

402.0 --> 406.56
is this guy and then that reflects on

405.12 --> 408.479
his daughter

406.56 --> 410.56
after she comes back because she's all

408.479 --> 411.35999999999996
in chaos doesn't listen anymore for a

410.56 --> 413.12
period and like

411.36 --> 414.96000000000004
mother has to really try to get through

413.12 --> 418.0
to her because she's just

414.96 --> 420.4
absorbed all that nuttiness being

418.0 --> 422.16
in his presence and he's not really

420.4 --> 425.28
capable of doing anything about it it's

422.16 --> 425.28000000000003
a crazy situation

425.44 --> 429.599
what does she look like yeah i'm not

427.599 --> 434.24
gonna

429.599 --> 434.24
share any details about her i'm

435.52 --> 440.31899999999996
i if i'm probably already just talking

438.639 --> 442.96000000000004
too much about it it's just that

440.319 --> 444.639
in a way she does very much inspire me

442.96 --> 448.23999999999995
and she's a very

444.639 --> 450.56
like a powerful person with great depths

448.24 --> 452.319
depths of character and strength also

450.56 --> 455.12
and

452.319 --> 455.759
like i really resonate with her in that

455.12 --> 457.84000000000003
because it's

455.759 --> 459.68
for her it's too like the entire world

457.84 --> 462.79999999999995
is just [ __ ] [ __ ]

459.68 --> 462.8
and she has to deal with it

463.44 --> 468.639
and has emotional issues then

466.479 --> 470.4
but she's really really doing her best

468.639 --> 474.639
and her daughter also

470.4 --> 477.919
strengthened that so it's just yeah

474.639 --> 478.639
very inspiring to me because she's had

477.919 --> 481.84
some

478.639 --> 485.199
absurd levels of adversity social

481.84 --> 487.52
disorder chaos from other people

485.199 --> 488.96000000000004
that would just mess up her life

487.52 --> 492.08
literally try to just

488.96 --> 494.4
spiritually choke her by

492.08 --> 495.599
sabotaging everything she does and she's

494.4 --> 499.28
crazy

495.599 --> 499.28
and what she's been subjected to

499.44 --> 504.319
and how she just perseveres through all

502.16 --> 504.319
that

504.4 --> 507.84
right uh

508.08 --> 512.0
thankfully i haven't personally really

510.4 --> 514.959
done anything like that

512.0 --> 516.959
although yeah our relation was kind of

514.959 --> 518.8
short-lived because i was not ready to

516.959 --> 522.56
tie down at the time but that's

518.8 --> 522.56
a long time that's my god

522.959 --> 527.92
that's 12 years ago right

533.6 --> 537.9200000000001
right here we go again but it's funny

535.839 --> 540.8800000000001
though because

537.92 --> 541.519
the way she spoke out about it i almost

540.88 --> 543.76
wish i

541.519 --> 545.279
i would have recorded that but it was

543.76 --> 546.72
over the phone and i'm not gonna do that

545.279 --> 550.0
to her and

546.72 --> 552.72
because she said it so well

550.0 --> 553.36
it was almost like listening to like a a

552.72 --> 556.88
doctor

553.36 --> 559.2
testimony about like masks or something

556.88 --> 560.56
like she really knows like holy [ __ ]

559.2 --> 564.32
these people are just

560.56 --> 567.8389999999999
blindly trying to follow stuff and

564.32 --> 569.519
like they can't make can be made to

567.839 --> 571.44
think about what they're doing they're

569.519 --> 572.16
just like following the system and

571.44 --> 576.08
they're so

572.16 --> 579.279
desperate to to not let it go

576.08 --> 580.9590000000001
in ways and they often don't even see it

579.279 --> 584.88
because it's so conditioned

580.959 --> 587.279
into basically virtue signaling with it

584.88 --> 588.8389999999999
with like we trust it we trust it it's

587.279 --> 592.959
it's a whole separate

588.839 --> 595.839
cult tear on its own in society

592.959 --> 597.4399999999999
among a certain frequency and it's kind

595.839 --> 599.12
of easy to fall it's like

597.44 --> 600.6400000000001
you can have a break and still keep

599.12 --> 604.72
going you can have a mental

600.64 --> 606.959
of not a break as in you break apart but

604.72 --> 608.88
take a pause mentally don't think too

606.959 --> 610.079
much about things and still keep going

608.88 --> 614.399
and that's kind of what it

610.079 --> 614.399
makes it so great at first

614.72 --> 618.0
but yeah it can grow out of control

617.44 --> 621.2
people can

618.0 --> 623.92
get in stuck in there and not come out

621.2 --> 625.44
and then everybody has a problem

623.92 --> 627.04
eventually

625.44 --> 628.8800000000001
and that's kind of what's going on now

627.04 --> 632.24
because they're like over

628.88 --> 632.88
pressuring the whole weave of how things

632.24 --> 634.72
work

632.88 --> 636.56
with all these crazy measures and

634.72 --> 640.399
everything

636.56 --> 643.1199999999999
and there are just people

640.399 --> 644.48
that are they can't let go they can

643.12 --> 648.24
because everything is

644.48 --> 653.44
the network the way things work has been

648.24 --> 656.72
destroyed eviscerated annihilated

653.44 --> 660.32
maybe one day something like that could

656.72 --> 662.399
return but it is established that it has

660.32 --> 665.839
been discontinued a wound

662.399 --> 666.959
has been cut and that wound will never

665.839 --> 670.8000000000001
be

666.959 --> 672.959
never a wound it might become a scar

670.8 --> 674.079
it might close up eventually become a

672.959 --> 676.8
scar

674.079 --> 678.16
but it has been and that part is

676.8 --> 680.7199999999999
something that some people

678.16 --> 680.7199999999999
just can't

681.36 --> 687.76
they can't handle it that is

685.04 --> 688.64
like that and so they cling on this

687.76 --> 691.2
virtual

688.64 --> 693.68
echo of what it was like basically

691.2 --> 694.0790000000001
trying to ignore reality as much as they

693.68 --> 697.519
can

694.079 --> 699.4399999999999
even like put on a mask and ignore that

697.519 --> 701.6
they're putting on a mask and why

699.44 --> 703.839
because they just want it to stop

701.6 --> 703.839
eventually

704.8 --> 709.1999999999999
very desperate inability to cope with

708.88 --> 713.68
the

709.2 --> 716.1600000000001
sudden abrupt change for the worse

713.68 --> 717.3599999999999
whatever the cause may be it's not

716.16 --> 719.36
really relevant it is

717.36 --> 720.639
just that it changed for the worse and

719.36 --> 723.92
it

720.639 --> 724.8
it's there it's not gonna go away just

723.92 --> 726.7199999999999
like that

724.8 --> 728.88
and there's just people that can't deal

726.72 --> 731.0400000000001
with it so they try to

728.88 --> 733.12
go along with it and ignoring it at the

731.04 --> 735.4399999999999
same time and

733.12 --> 737.68
all kinds of weird because i see it out

735.44 --> 739.9200000000001
there there's literally people

737.68 --> 741.5999999999999
that are i'm i'm paying closer attention

739.92 --> 744.0
because there's plenty of people still

741.6 --> 746.32
wearing masks it's like i guess half it

744.0 --> 748.959
goes up and down it's very confusing

746.32 --> 752.399
it's one day i see a lot of masks then

748.959 --> 754.3199999999999
only a few and but i've noticed that a

752.399 --> 757.44
lot of people the ones that i've kind of

754.32 --> 759.44
gotten to know before this situation

757.44 --> 762.8000000000001
that have a certain level they're not

759.44 --> 762.8000000000001
like really stupid people

763.36 --> 770.399
they they're doing it and they are

766.88 --> 772.0
literally ignoring it they're basically

770.399 --> 773.68
i'm looking at it and then i'm like

772.0 --> 776.639
almost like trying to

773.68 --> 777.279
experiment with my mind and say okay i'm

776.639 --> 780.32
virtually

777.279 --> 783.36
rendering the mask away and then

780.32 --> 786.32
trying to compare that image

783.36 --> 787.12
with the virtual taking away of the mask

786.32 --> 789.12
with

787.12 --> 790.48
a situation in the past and then i

789.12 --> 794.32
noticed like yes they

790.48 --> 794.32
really are trying to ignore it

796.88 --> 801.8389999999999
and that kind of caught my attention a

799.279 --> 801.8389999999999
little

802.88 --> 810.32
but yeah there are also like the

806.16 --> 813.4399999999999
the yeah the the more

810.32 --> 814.0
slipped down people that are more like

813.44 --> 816.0790000000001
mask

814.0 --> 817.36
enthusiasts and they are very under

816.079 --> 821.5999999999999
tension and they are

817.36 --> 824.9590000000001
like we're acting they have a weird

821.6 --> 826.24
pecking order spirit in them right now

824.959 --> 828.7199999999999
it's you reckon

826.24 --> 830.16
once you realize that you will recognize

828.72 --> 834.399
it it is

830.16 --> 839.04
they even kind of like have that

834.399 --> 839.68
posture of a pecking order situation you

839.04 --> 843.519
should pay

839.68 --> 846.88
if you have chickens and hands and [ __ ]

843.519 --> 849.199
you should you could study that

846.88 --> 852.0
and just try to compare it you'll see

849.199 --> 854.24
like their posture

852.0 --> 855.279
they are in a pecking order mindset

854.24 --> 857.279
sometimes and

855.279 --> 858.88
those are like the mask enthusiast those

857.279 --> 859.92
are the people that would bother other

858.88 --> 862.959
people that would be

859.92 --> 864.959
like outrageous that you didn't keep the

862.959 --> 866.7199999999999
exact distance required that sort of

864.959 --> 868.3199999999999
[ __ ] you know

866.72 --> 872.48
and it is really like they're in a

868.32 --> 872.48
pecking order game mindset

873.199 --> 878.3199999999999
it's very weird because it is a game but

875.36 --> 881.6800000000001
it is a very serious

878.32 --> 884.9590000000001
game for yeah creatures that apply the

881.68 --> 887.68
packing order it's basically a way of

884.959 --> 888.6389999999999
establishing hierarchy in a more

887.68 --> 891.92
automated

888.639 --> 894.72
way that requires less attention

891.92 --> 897.04
it's weird and again see there's all

894.72 --> 898.639
these ways of approach all these

897.04 --> 900.639
ways of doing things and the more you

898.639 --> 905.76
get stressed out the more it's gonna get

900.639 --> 909.44
forced to some really base basal

905.76 --> 911.92
type of way you're going about and

909.44 --> 913.36
this is being done this is being applied

911.92 --> 916.24
it has been

913.36 --> 919.04
incrementally experimented with levels

916.24 --> 921.12
of pressure from different sites

919.04 --> 922.399
and then yeah people respond in a

921.12 --> 926.48
certain way and this

922.399 --> 929.12
is just it's all fitting like a glove

926.48 --> 929.6800000000001
the way things are unrolled the way

929.12 --> 933.279
people

929.68 --> 935.04
are transiting in their

933.279 --> 937.199
in their mode of operation their

935.04 --> 939.68
personal mode of opera it's transiting

937.199 --> 940.16
perfectly it's smooth it's scarily

939.68 --> 942.8
smooth

940.16 --> 944.8
how well it all fits there's no real

942.8 --> 947.8389999999999
unexpected chaos people

944.8 --> 948.8
there's none everything is happening

947.839 --> 951.36
there is no

948.8 --> 952.639
super unexpected event that's literally

951.36 --> 955.519
like what

952.639 --> 956.9590000000001
and that just nobody knows what to think

955.519 --> 958.72
about it

956.959 --> 960.3199999999999
when's the last time anything like that

958.72 --> 963.44
happened

960.32 --> 966.72
people when is the last time anything

963.44 --> 970.5600000000001
happened out there that you just that

966.72 --> 970.5600000000001
that boggles everybody's minds

971.519 --> 977.36
it's quite some time ago now

975.68 --> 978.8
because things are happening there might

977.36 --> 982.24
be shocking but it

978.8 --> 984.7199999999999
is all very smooth

982.24 --> 985.5600000000001
and accounted for and everything and

984.72 --> 989.44
people are

985.56 --> 993.4399999999999
seemingly in the know and acting

989.44 --> 997.2790000000001
and yeah when's the last time something

993.44 --> 997.2790000000001
like really surprising happen

1008.839 --> 1011.839
nothing

1020.24 --> 1039.839
all the time baby what do you mean what

1024.4 --> 1039.8390000000002
oh you're talking about other stuff

1049.6 --> 1053.84
don't do that

1070.32 --> 1076.48
yeah that's a bit maybe aries 106

1074.799 --> 1078.08
woke up on the wrong side of the bed

1076.48 --> 1081.2
today

1078.08 --> 1083.84
i can definitely imagine maybe i

1081.2 --> 1085.28
i just dug a little too deep and

1083.84 --> 1087.36
confronted him with like

1085.28 --> 1089.52
yeah the unpleasantness of some

1087.36 --> 1092.3999999999999
realities

1089.52 --> 1093.36
and also the it's because you know even

1092.4 --> 1095.44
if you know

1093.36 --> 1097.84
kind of how to deal with the reality

1095.44 --> 1100.0
that's happening for yourself

1097.84 --> 1101.4399999999998
there's still a whole lot of people out

1100.0 --> 1104.88
there that you might be

1101.44 --> 1108.16
connected with in some way that

1104.88 --> 1110.0
are not handling it well so even if

1108.16 --> 1111.919
you don't have a problem with it you

1110.0 --> 1114.32
will still have a problem with it and

1111.919 --> 1116.0800000000002
that is just very annoying so maybe i

1114.32 --> 1118.0
just pushed a little too far and he got

1116.08 --> 1121.76
kind of

1118.0 --> 1126.08
yeah too loaded too tense and then

1121.76 --> 1126.08
said something that's really rude indeed

1128.08 --> 1133.9189999999999
and a straw man but i you know i

1131.28 --> 1135.76
i do overall respect ares 106 he's a

1133.919 --> 1138.3200000000002
pretty cool guy but yeah that was over

1135.76 --> 1138.32
line there

1140.64 --> 1151.8400000000001
a flatterer

1154.24 --> 1158.88
no he's not a flatter he's just he's

1156.72 --> 1162.84
just been a good guy

1158.88 --> 1165.8400000000001
why why what are you saying not trust me

1162.84 --> 1165.84
no

1169.84 --> 1174.72
i don't think so i think i recognize it

1172.4 --> 1174.72
you know

1175.6 --> 1179.36
dude i've had those moments where i

1177.84 --> 1182.1599999999999
would just out of nowhere say

1179.36 --> 1185.28
something really rude like the lowest

1182.16 --> 1187.679
blow i could imagine

1185.28 --> 1189.44
it's basically like your best buddy just

1187.679 --> 1191.039
kicking you in the shins because he's in

1189.44 --> 1192.3200000000002
a really shitty mood i think it's

1191.039 --> 1194.48
something like that

1192.32 --> 1194.48
so

1196.96 --> 1202.4
yeah and by the way after that's

1198.64 --> 1202.4
probably not gonna be the best buddy

1203.28 --> 1208.72
but why i had have done even such no i'm

1207.52 --> 1211.76
not kicking the [ __ ]

1208.72 --> 1215.679
because that's just nasty but

1211.76 --> 1217.52
just where you become a real life troll

1215.679 --> 1221.679
i've done that [ __ ] with my brother

1217.52 --> 1224.08
now he was a little older so

1221.679 --> 1226.0
he could take it and he would do it a

1224.08 --> 1226.8799999999999
little with me too because i did push it

1226.0 --> 1230.08
i was

1226.88 --> 1235.8400000000001
just such a nuisance anyway like always

1230.08 --> 1235.84
physically testing people

1237.679 --> 1242.0800000000002
but yeah i had a lot of agility

1239.76 --> 1244.1589999999999
capability and you have to train it

1242.08 --> 1247.1999999999998
somehow and that was kind of it just

1244.159 --> 1249.679
instincts figuring out reflexes with

1247.2 --> 1252.88
other people and yourself and

1249.679 --> 1255.76
you know that and

1252.88 --> 1256.64
like how instinctual threat perceival

1255.76 --> 1259.039
works like

1256.64 --> 1260.88
trying to because this is one of these

1259.039 --> 1262.72
things that also work into the skills

1260.88 --> 1263.5200000000002
that i have now sizing people up

1262.72 --> 1268.159
basically my

1263.52 --> 1269.76
yeah my psychokinetic and psychokinetic

1268.159 --> 1273.2800000000002
nuts uh

1269.76 --> 1275.52
psionic power what the [ __ ] telepathic

1273.28 --> 1276.559
related light it's like it's almost

1275.52 --> 1278.4
telepathy

1276.559 --> 1279.76
but it's not really it's not lit it's

1278.4 --> 1283.2
not telepathy as

1279.76 --> 1285.76
explained in the classical sense

1283.2 --> 1289.28
it's more just like spirits it's a

1285.76 --> 1291.679
complicated weave and it reflects back

1289.28 --> 1293.84
like a dream but it's real you know it's

1291.679 --> 1293.8400000000001
real

1294.24 --> 1297.679
it's just complicated

1297.919 --> 1302.64
but ah now i lost a train of thought

1311.679 --> 1316.8400000000001
yeah training just training instincts

1314.159 --> 1318.159
and knowing like how somebody's radar

1316.84 --> 1320.6399999999999
works

1318.159 --> 1322.24
and it's weird because i i can visually

1320.64 --> 1324.64
see it

1322.24 --> 1327.6
when somebody's alertness senses go off

1324.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
like even if i don't see their face

1327.6 --> 1333.84
i can it's almost like i can see it

1334.08 --> 1339.039
it's yeah i can even see it when i have

1338.64 --> 1342.4
it

1339.039 --> 1345.76
it's literally like there's just this

1342.4 --> 1346.48
pulse going off like an electromagnetic

1345.76 --> 1349.28
pulse

1346.48 --> 1349.28
situation

1349.679 --> 1355.2
and yeah cats have it too

1353.039 --> 1357.52
but they have it very well and it's like

1355.2 --> 1361.28
it their entire body or their fur

1357.52 --> 1363.9189999999999
or something is strengthen it

1361.28 --> 1366.0
is like influencing the whatever this is

1363.919 --> 1368.48
this electrostatic

1366.0 --> 1375.28
field that comes with alertness

1368.48 --> 1377.3600000000001
reactions it's very fascinating

1375.28 --> 1378.72
it's not telekinesis telekinesis is

1377.36 --> 1381.6789999999999
physically moving

1378.72 --> 1382.32
things with your mind i've never been

1381.679 --> 1384.88
able to

1382.32 --> 1386.96
do that although i've had telekinetic

1384.88 --> 1387.44
side effects but that could be explained

1386.96 --> 1390.72
throughout

1387.44 --> 1392.96
it it's just electrostatics or

1390.72 --> 1392.96
but

1395.76 --> 1403.84
i've never mastered telekinesis trust me

1398.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
i tried

1404.0 --> 1409.12
but yeah telepathy like abilities have

1407.52 --> 1412.799
worked great

1409.12 --> 1416.6399999999999
for me it's become second nature

1412.799 --> 1419.679
it's literally normal i yeah

1416.64 --> 1424.3200000000002
and i think that maybe in the far

1419.679 --> 1424.3200000000002
far past it was also normal

1424.799 --> 1427.84
and it's just been taken away from

1426.72 --> 1430.0
people

1427.84 --> 1431.36
that called it witchcraft and all this

1430.0 --> 1434.559
[ __ ] and

1431.36 --> 1437.6789999999999
just fear lots of fear

1434.559 --> 1441.36
lots of convolution lots of corruption

1437.679 --> 1443.919
whatever and

1441.36 --> 1445.1999999999998
and well maybe even the tower of babel

1443.919 --> 1447.5200000000002
caused it to literally

1445.2 --> 1448.64
just dampen that power for a while and

1447.52 --> 1451.2
that has

1448.64 --> 1453.5200000000002
forced people to become more verbal and

1451.2 --> 1453.52
written

1456.72 --> 1463.2
because before that we would just have

1459.36 --> 1463.1999999999998
standard spirit communication

1464.64 --> 1468.96
right and yeah i'm kind of attempting to

1468.0 --> 1471.84
bring it back

1468.96 --> 1474.72
bring back the old yeah the old way of

1471.84 --> 1474.72
doing things and

1474.88 --> 1479.3600000000001
opening it up but yeah to what am i

1477.6 --> 1481.76
opening it up

1479.36 --> 1485.039
this world what the people deal with the

1481.76 --> 1488.799
convolution the craziness the

1485.039 --> 1491.679
the naggingly hanging on to

1488.799 --> 1494.4
petty mistakes and [ __ ] that doesn't

1491.679 --> 1498.64
exactly help

1494.4 --> 1501.039
so but yeah there will be people that

1498.64 --> 1501.76
might just learn how to do this and some

1501.039 --> 1504.48
of them

1501.76 --> 1505.039
will have always known how to do this

1504.48 --> 1506.559
always

1505.039 --> 1508.32
since they were a kid and they'd just

1506.559 --> 1509.76
forgotten that it existed because

1508.32 --> 1512.48
nobody's doing that

1509.76 --> 1513.279
anymore they become isolated and then it

1512.48 --> 1515.679
just

1513.279 --> 1516.88
fades out of their memory that way of

1515.679 --> 1520.159
doing things

1516.88 --> 1520.159
well i'm bringing it back

1521.09 --> 1529.84
[Music]

1523.6 --> 1529.84
i'm opening up the grove

1530.75 --> 1533.95
[Music]

1540.96 --> 1549.44
but doing it in my way

1544.72 --> 1549.44
with a vision towards the future

1549.76 --> 1554.4
and with the idea of basically

1552.12 --> 1557.4399999999998
reconstructing

1554.4 --> 1560.72
a sensible and so critical to me

1557.44 --> 1564.64
a more honest way

1560.72 --> 1564.64
of just doing everything

1569.039 --> 1576.64
like not an ideology not a religion

1573.52 --> 1579.84
not a form of government but

1576.64 --> 1585.1200000000001
just the path the the method

1579.84 --> 1587.76
another hierarchy of doing things

1585.12 --> 1588.2399999999998
and you can still work with the other

1587.76 --> 1591.679
things

1588.24 --> 1592.159
out there it's just that it's better to

1591.679 --> 1594.72
see it

1592.159 --> 1596.8400000000001
these ways because you have more grip

1594.72 --> 1600.72
over the situation that way that's

1596.84 --> 1603.9189999999999
my that's what i've been finding

1600.72 --> 1606.799
out from personal experience it's just

1603.919 --> 1606.7990000000002
i believe in this

1607.12 --> 1615.76
following the path using

1610.32 --> 1618.72
carefully devised methods and approaches

1615.76 --> 1621.279
an esoteric approach where you try to

1618.72 --> 1624.96
get to the ultimate core

1621.279 --> 1628.159
from as many perspectives as you can

1624.96 --> 1631.52
so oh never just saying it's only this

1628.159 --> 1633.919
because nothing is only this

1631.52 --> 1634.6399999999999
whatever it is nothing is only this it's

1633.919 --> 1638.3200000000002
all

1634.64 --> 1639.5200000000002
interconnected and only then when you

1638.32 --> 1642.1589999999999
really get a

1639.52 --> 1643.679
feeling for that like in the entire

1642.159 --> 1647.279
reality is just like a

1643.679 --> 1648.96
giant crystal crystalline structure of

1647.279 --> 1652.08
interconnected layers and

1648.96 --> 1655.1200000000001
colors and everything on every level

1652.08 --> 1657.84
with similarities and

1655.12 --> 1658.4799999999998
wild differences including but it all

1657.84 --> 1661.52
just still

1658.48 --> 1663.679
fits and if you get a feel for that and

1661.52 --> 1666.08
you don't let it distract you too much

1663.679 --> 1666.88
because it can be just like geomatria

1666.08 --> 1669.039
you get

1666.88 --> 1670.159
stuck at only thinking about that well

1669.039 --> 1672.72
then the spell

1670.159 --> 1674.5590000000002
caught you away from reality because one

1672.72 --> 1677.1200000000001
of the primary objectives of

1674.559 --> 1680.0
insight is that you don't let it

1677.12 --> 1681.76
distract you from your regular life

1680.0 --> 1683.36
because it's so important that the

1681.76 --> 1685.6
smarter you are the more important

1683.36 --> 1689.1999999999998
becomes to just

1685.6 --> 1692.399
also use that smart to figure out how to

1689.2 --> 1692.799
live right and to account for what you

1692.399 --> 1695.36
can

1692.799 --> 1696.559
feel and everything to really do it

1695.36 --> 1699.1999999999998
right

1696.559 --> 1701.2
be an example at it because then

1699.2 --> 1701.76
everything becomes better you become

1701.2 --> 1704.0
better

1701.76 --> 1706.399
but also the world out there will it's

1704.0 --> 1709.12
like it's like spreading seeds out there

1706.399 --> 1710.799
you grow and suddenly others do it too

1709.12 --> 1712.559
and you don't even know whether they've

1710.799 --> 1715.52
done it because of you

1712.559 --> 1717.6
or whether it was just an echo or

1715.52 --> 1721.679
resonation somehow

1717.6 --> 1722.48
but if you've not done it then you will

1721.679 --> 1725.919
not see

1722.48 --> 1727.919
that effect with other people around you

1725.919 --> 1730.7990000000002
they might be out there but you will

1727.919 --> 1730.7990000000002
never meet them

1735.279 --> 1739.84
so it's just important to do this and

1737.36 --> 1744.08
that's yeah i'm

1739.84 --> 1746.24
yeah i feel kind of like a pioneer

1744.08 --> 1747.76
what i'm doing it's like i saw the

1746.24 --> 1751.039
opportunity i'm

1747.76 --> 1754.32
i'm a scientist i'm a spiritualist

1751.039 --> 1757.6
i'm a paladin esoterically

1754.32 --> 1759.36
it's can't say it any other way

1757.6 --> 1760.6399999999999
and have a lot of friction because of

1759.36 --> 1763.1999999999998
that

1760.64 --> 1763.8400000000001
in myself a lot of struggle a lot of

1763.2 --> 1766.48
struggle

1763.84 --> 1769.279
because it's just yeah intelligence

1766.48 --> 1772.08
brings a lot of

1769.279 --> 1772.96
wildness and even potential bad ways you

1772.08 --> 1776.1589999999999
see too much

1772.96 --> 1776.559
and then that tries to take control over

1776.159 --> 1780.3200000000002
you

1776.559 --> 1783.36
and i have to fight it and it's

1780.32 --> 1783.76
yeah it's a lot of shouting back and

1783.36 --> 1786.559
forth

1783.76 --> 1786.8799999999999
inside my head sometimes because of that

1786.559 --> 1788.96
yeah

1786.88 --> 1791.5200000000002
scientists applying the scientific

1788.96 --> 1794.799
method and gathering data

1791.52 --> 1798.0
and never convoluting that data and then

1794.799 --> 1799.6399999999999
figuring out honestly and truthfully and

1798.0 --> 1802.72
technically correct

1799.64 --> 1804.88
presuppositional offsets

1802.72 --> 1805.84
as to figuring out what could

1804.88 --> 1809.1200000000001
potentially

1805.84 --> 1811.52
really be out there and how and what the

1809.12 --> 1814.559
natural consequences and how it will all

1811.52 --> 1818.799
fit yeah as scientists you know the word

1814.559 --> 1822.24
scientists is kind of outdated

1818.799 --> 1825.9189999999999
in comparison to what i actually do

1822.24 --> 1830.24
i'm just a cosmogenist a cosmogenist

1825.919 --> 1831.76
i'm a a world builder from a theoretical

1830.24 --> 1833.84
vantage point

1831.76 --> 1835.2
theoretical world build it's what i do i

1833.84 --> 1838.32
can do it

1835.2 --> 1841.1200000000001
and i'm good at it and it seems

1838.32 --> 1844.72
sometimes completely pointless

1841.12 --> 1847.76
because yeah

1844.72 --> 1848.3990000000001
i'm pretty much alone or there's people

1847.76 --> 1849.919
that

1848.399 --> 1852.32
think they're competing with me but

1849.919 --> 1853.8400000000001
they're just obsessed with competition

1852.32 --> 1857.12
and not with cosmogeny

1853.84 --> 1859.4399999999998
they can't do it so i'm alone and i feel

1857.12 --> 1863.279
like a lone wizard in this i'm the

1859.44 --> 1866.3200000000002
cosmogeny wizard and i'm just like

1863.279 --> 1869.2
kind of like gandalf at the shire

1866.32 --> 1870.48
like uh yeah oh it's so nice but we're a

1869.2 --> 1872.0
troublemaker

1870.48 --> 1873.519
that's what i feel like sometimes

1872.0 --> 1877.12
without i do but

1873.519 --> 1879.84
yeah i do it anyway because i can

1877.12 --> 1880.1589999999999
and i think it's necessary and i'm just

1879.84 --> 1883.039
in

1880.159 --> 1885.0390000000002
grief over the world all drowning in

1883.039 --> 1888.24
their own ignorance

1885.039 --> 1891.12
i'm in grief over it since it first

1888.24 --> 1891.1200000000001
caught on to me

1891.679 --> 1898.0
in grief depression level

1894.72 --> 1900.24
grief over how stupid people

1898.0 --> 1902.799
are and that they're suffering under

1900.24 --> 1904.88
their own stupidity

1902.799 --> 1907.76
that they had all this potential in them

1904.88 --> 1910.72
that it was just burned and cut away

1907.76 --> 1913.039
and they don't even know it they do know

1910.72 --> 1915.1200000000001
it but they

1913.039 --> 1916.24
all mechanically push it away because

1915.12 --> 1918.9599999999998
it's all too much

1916.24 --> 1920.32
it's a giant tragedy and it's very

1918.96 --> 1922.48
suffering

1920.32 --> 1924.399
it's big suffering to me it has been for

1922.48 --> 1925.84
a long time it's the reason i went into

1924.399 --> 1929.4399999999998
the goth

1925.84 --> 1931.039
to give that a place to somehow give the

1929.44 --> 1934.159
suffering a place

1931.039 --> 1935.679
and not let it kill me and choke me like

1934.159 --> 1938.159
it did some other people

1935.679 --> 1940.88
that literally did end up dead through

1938.159 --> 1940.88
suicide

1941.039 --> 1947.6
because of this and i've

1944.08 --> 1948.559
i've i'm ascending through it it's that

1947.6 --> 1951.9189999999999
misery

1948.559 --> 1955.6
well i'm i went deep

1951.919 --> 1957.6000000000001
just to get out just to get out i

1955.6 --> 1959.6
i had to otherwise i would be

1957.6 --> 1962.08
disconnected from the world forever and

1959.6 --> 1962.6399999999999
i would lose all sympathy forever i had

1962.08 --> 1964.96
to

1962.64 --> 1966.159
stick my freaking toe in there i had to

1964.96 --> 1968.32
sink

1966.159 --> 1971.44
so i would know what it was like and get

1968.32 --> 1976.1589999999999
out of it and then learn that

1971.44 --> 1979.76
how to explain how to get out of this

1976.159 --> 1979.7600000000002
out of real

1979.84 --> 1986.48
just suffering and inability

1983.76 --> 1988.32
where everybody's shaming you because

1986.48 --> 1990.24
you're supposedly a cool

1988.32 --> 1991.519
intelligent person and you're in a place

1990.24 --> 1994.24
where you're so

1991.519 --> 1996.32
[ __ ] that you can't even control your

1994.24 --> 1998.88
own memory anymore

1996.32 --> 2000.799
and those people then try to destroy the

1998.88 --> 2002.0800000000002
world or they commit suicide well they

2000.799 --> 2005.519
can get out

2002.08 --> 2008.559
they can get out

2005.519 --> 2010.88
but it is a titanic task well what is

2008.559 --> 2012.24
better than a titanic task with

2010.88 --> 2015.2
suffering

2012.24 --> 2017.279
it's like to me it was like this choice

2015.2 --> 2021.44
i'd rather

2017.279 --> 2023.039
live a life of torture then ended out of

2021.44 --> 2026.48
cowardice

2023.039 --> 2029.44
i'd rather live like torture and

2026.48 --> 2031.3600000000001
even from a depressive perspective i

2029.44 --> 2035.2
could see it even on another layer

2031.36 --> 2035.1999999999998
everything that i do and basically see

2035.36 --> 2040.6399999999999
see this torture that i undergo to

2038.48 --> 2041.76
improve myself and i can do it and you

2040.64 --> 2044.5590000000002
are

2041.76 --> 2044.96
tiny tiny specks of dust and you can't

2044.559 --> 2047.6789999999999
even

2044.96 --> 2049.599
attain what i'm doing and that's the

2047.679 --> 2053.359
other side perspective

2049.599 --> 2056.0
that i don't really give any time

2053.359 --> 2058.879
today but it's there it's a natural

2056.0 --> 2060.879
other side of the layer

2058.879 --> 2063.04
but i just try to encourage and just

2060.879 --> 2064.159
hope that there will be people that will

2063.04 --> 2067.919
be able to copy

2064.159 --> 2071.599
in ways what i do from a very

2067.919 --> 2071.5989999999997
seemingly hopeless perspective

2072.24 --> 2076.24
and i don't have to talk about it with

2074.0 --> 2078.399
anyone they could just see it they can

2076.24 --> 2081.5989999999997
go through it and just let it sink

2078.399 --> 2083.7599999999998
that it is possible because

2081.599 --> 2085.839
i don't know you know i'm not

2083.76 --> 2089.119
financially super successful although

2085.839 --> 2091.7599999999998
i'm not as bad as i used to be

2089.119 --> 2092.8790000000004
i'm pretty healthy and pretty stable i

2091.76 --> 2094.96
was in a terrible

2092.879 --> 2096.7999999999997
terrible state for a long time and i had

2094.96 --> 2098.4
to work at it because if i wouldn't

2096.8 --> 2099.2000000000003
things would have gone worse so i'm just

2098.4 --> 2101.92
the example

2099.2 --> 2103.4399999999996
yes you can get out you can it is

2101.92 --> 2106.88
possible

2103.44 --> 2109.44
and if i had only known a person like me

2106.88 --> 2111.28
that i could bear to listen to and have

2109.44 --> 2112.16
the patience to come back again and

2111.28 --> 2114.7200000000003
again again

2112.16 --> 2115.52
and test them and get punished and still

2114.72 --> 2118.72
come back

2115.52 --> 2120.16
if i only had somebody like that then i

2118.72 --> 2122.8799999999997
would have gone through that

2120.16 --> 2123.92
[ __ ] a lot quicker and was able to

2122.88 --> 2125.6800000000003
basically

2123.92 --> 2128.56
join with the rest of the world and

2125.68 --> 2130.8799999999997
start helping to build somewhat

2128.56 --> 2134.88
sooner instead of just sitting there

2130.88 --> 2138.079
being miserable for a very long time

2134.88 --> 2140.96
because all that misery is literally

2138.079 --> 2143.119
a drag on all the energy and all the

2140.96 --> 2146.16
people that are really trying

2143.119 --> 2146.8
but are also caught up in [ __ ] that

2146.16 --> 2149.2799999999997
sucks

2146.8 --> 2150.7200000000003
off those people it sucks off the energy

2149.28 --> 2153.8390000000004
of the titans

2150.72 --> 2155.7599999999998
to be miserable and hopeless you know to

2153.839 --> 2157.599
be miserable everybody gets miserable

2155.76 --> 2160.4
every now and then

2157.599 --> 2161.76
if you have purpose if you have a normal

2160.4 --> 2164.32
life train

2161.76 --> 2165.28
and things to do so important things to

2164.32 --> 2171.119
do that

2165.28 --> 2171.119
have a future prospect then you can just

2171.52 --> 2177.2
get out of that misery if you don't

2174.64 --> 2179.2799999999997
have plans if you have nothing to work

2177.2 --> 2181.52
towards you don't know what you want you

2179.28 --> 2183.44
don't know what the world is yeah then

2181.52 --> 2186.0
you got a problem

2183.44 --> 2187.04
so you need somebody to basically show

2186.0 --> 2190.96
you

2187.04 --> 2193.52
how to get out of that position

2190.96 --> 2194.0
climbing that stairs and improving

2193.52 --> 2195.52
yourself

2194.0 --> 2198.079
taking the challenges taking the

2195.52 --> 2200.48
punishment a lot of screaming probably

2198.079 --> 2203.92
accompany that right you're going to be

2200.48 --> 2207.04
very very frustrated at times

2203.92 --> 2209.2000000000003
but every time you get through that

2207.04 --> 2210.32
you get courage back you get strength

2209.2 --> 2213.2799999999997
back because

2210.32 --> 2214.0
you're building you're growing it works

2213.28 --> 2216.88
you're not

2214.0 --> 2218.32
that weak miserable pile of [ __ ] you

2216.88 --> 2220.1600000000003
used to be

2218.32 --> 2223.599
and you'll never allow yourself to

2220.16 --> 2223.5989999999997
become that bad again

2224.72 --> 2229.839
now that is the best comfort you can

2226.96 --> 2229.839
imagine

2230.0 --> 2234.0
and people can get there

2234.56 --> 2241.359
even though they cannot feel it

2238.32 --> 2244.32
or everybody around them only reflects

2241.359 --> 2245.839
more misery you can get out of that you

2244.32 --> 2247.52
just have to get out of

2245.839 --> 2249.599
that you have to connect to something

2247.52 --> 2251.839
right you have to

2249.599 --> 2253.92
get that spark somewhere that right

2251.839 --> 2257.119
spark the right energy

2253.92 --> 2260.56
and hold on to it and let it

2257.119 --> 2263.839
sink in and start to

2260.56 --> 2266.48
envision well how to get out

2263.839 --> 2267.839
where to go but make sure that where you

2266.48 --> 2270.56
wanna go

2267.839 --> 2271.7599999999998
is right because when you shift in the

2270.56 --> 2275.44
darkness

2271.76 --> 2276.1600000000003
what you seem to want becomes all

2275.44 --> 2279.44
demonic

2276.16 --> 2281.2799999999997
eventually and you cannot use that to

2279.44 --> 2282.0
get out of it it's the delusion

2281.28 --> 2285.28
projected

2282.0 --> 2286.88
over it over the experience to deal with

2285.28 --> 2288.88
being that miserable

2286.88 --> 2291.04
but you can't use that to get out of it

2288.88 --> 2292.079
so you have to envision something that

2291.04 --> 2295.119
is sensible

2292.079 --> 2298.6400000000003
even if you can't seem to stand it

2295.119 --> 2299.76
from the darkness perspective you still

2298.64 --> 2301.92
have to do it

2299.76 --> 2304.1600000000003
because it's the only way to get out of

2301.92 --> 2304.16
there

2306.24 --> 2312.8799999999997
logos the rules the rules

2309.52 --> 2316.0
are not dynamic

2312.88 --> 2319.52
they are what they are and there are

2316.0 --> 2322.079
consequences to the rules and it's very

2319.52 --> 2323.44
complicated sometimes how they work what

2322.079 --> 2326.0
the effect will be

2323.44 --> 2327.44
but they are what they are even if you

2326.0 --> 2330.96
don't want it if

2327.44 --> 2334.7200000000003
you can't make it any other way you can

2330.96 --> 2337.44
deal it with any way you like avoid it

2334.72 --> 2338.48
do it do something in between whatever

2337.44 --> 2341.839
that's all fine

2338.48 --> 2345.599
but it is what it is

2341.839 --> 2349.04
and nothing can change that

2345.599 --> 2352.079
nothing the spectrum of things

2349.04 --> 2352.079
is what it is

2352.16 --> 2358.3999999999996
no model is going to replace it

2356.88 --> 2361.52
and that also by the way counts for a

2358.4 --> 2361.52
certain globe model

2366.839 --> 2374.0
right oh god yeah black worm

2369.92 --> 2377.04
i'm not a religious person and i know

2374.0 --> 2377.04
that god exists

2380.4 --> 2385.2000000000003
i don't believe it i know it cannot be

2383.68 --> 2387.1189999999997
any other way it's absolute

2385.2 --> 2396.0
impossibility

2387.119 --> 2398.8
even by virtual standards

2396.0 --> 2400.079
there has to be a designer even when we

2398.8 --> 2403.44
try to conceive

2400.079 --> 2407.2000000000003
reality and designing we are

2403.44 --> 2410.7200000000003
a sheer emulation of the universal setup

2407.2 --> 2411.1189999999997
of creation and the creator we are a

2410.72 --> 2414.9599999999996
mere

2411.119 --> 2418.079
echo of it in the in what is going on

2414.96 --> 2421.119
like a fractal because

2418.079 --> 2421.44
that is the only thing that can be there

2421.119 --> 2425.2000000000003
is

2421.44 --> 2428.48
no other way it does not matter what you

2425.2 --> 2439.839
want doesn't matter

2428.48 --> 2439.839
what is is that is just the way it is

2452.16 --> 2456.96
i think i gave you all the answers you

2454.079 --> 2456.96
need blackworm

2464.319 --> 2470.8
yes yes i did i'm not going to answer

2467.599 --> 2481.44
a square scribed down list of

2470.8 --> 2483.44
questions for you

2481.44 --> 2485.599
yeah i know you do i'm not here to

2483.44 --> 2488.16
answer you your scribed list of

2485.599 --> 2491.2000000000003
questions

2488.16 --> 2494.0
i already gave you very in-depth answers

2491.2 --> 2497.7599999999998
i'm not here to

2494.0 --> 2500.96
just answer some list of questions

2497.76 --> 2501.6800000000003
now if you have questions and you want

2500.96 --> 2504.8
to learn

2501.68 --> 2505.839
you want to continue where that goes i

2504.8 --> 2509.2000000000003
will answer you

2505.839 --> 2510.7999999999997
and i will give you everything you need

2509.2 --> 2513.68
but you don't seem to be interesting

2510.8 --> 2517.119
because i'm not going to just

2513.68 --> 2518.48
answer some list of questions for you

2517.119 --> 2520.96
i'm not going to help you in your

2518.48 --> 2537.34
statistical research

2520.96 --> 2541.119
i will answer big life questions though

2537.34 --> 2541.119
[Music]

2546.56 --> 2551.839
yeah that's right again

2576.839 --> 2579.839
ugh

2580.56 --> 2583.68
okay blackworm

2591.04 --> 2598.319
yes i do i have giant amounts of answers

2595.119 --> 2600.56
giant but the problem is is you're if

2598.319 --> 2602.88
you're gonna ask questions that are on a

2600.56 --> 2602.88
list

2603.52 --> 2607.04
right then you're not esoterically

2606.079 --> 2610.4
engaged

2607.04 --> 2613.44
you're engaging in exoteric and

2610.4 --> 2614.079
question and answers and those don't

2613.44 --> 2616.64
last

2614.079 --> 2618.0
the ages that's my experience now

2616.64 --> 2621.2
understanding

2618.0 --> 2623.44
gained in the moment through

2621.2 --> 2626.96
the question and answer very specific

2623.44 --> 2629.68
there's no answer without a question

2626.96 --> 2631.68
now that is something else and that's

2629.68 --> 2632.56
much more valuable in my opinion than

2631.68 --> 2637.04
just some

2632.56 --> 2640.4
list of questions but

2637.04 --> 2642.4
whatever you don't have a list

2640.4 --> 2645.28
okay well you did say earlier that you

2642.4 --> 2645.28
did kind of had

2646.839 --> 2651.839
one

2648.56 --> 2655.359
you had some other questions

2651.839 --> 2655.359
oh that sounds like a list but

2658.16 --> 2664.64
my world perspective well that's fine

2661.28 --> 2668.079
i i'd suggest you start watching

2664.64 --> 2668.72
let's just say the last 50 early bird

2668.079 --> 2670.88
shows

2668.72 --> 2673.359
okay that's 50 hours well you could

2670.88 --> 2675.2000000000003
probably do that in a week

2673.359 --> 2677.2
if you're actually interested and you

2675.2 --> 2680.48
can probably skip some parts

2677.2 --> 2683.68
but i wouldn't yeah whatever play

2680.48 --> 2685.68
quickly through it and speed down when

2683.68 --> 2688.839
i'm actually talking in depth

2685.68 --> 2691.1189999999997
and technical and then you'll figure it

2688.839 --> 2697.359
out

2691.119 --> 2699.839
i'm i prescribe esoteric christianity

2697.359 --> 2702.48
to myself and that doesn't mean

2699.839 --> 2702.48
religious

2702.88 --> 2712.2400000000002
at all it's a very esoteric approach

2708.079 --> 2714.079
i focus on the path path of christ an

2712.24 --> 2718.72
exemplary

2714.079 --> 2721.44
way to do things and a mindset a focus

2718.72 --> 2723.2
and an objective and a method the

2721.44 --> 2726.319
methods he used

2723.2 --> 2728.64
the methods of diplomacy the way

2726.319 --> 2728.64
through

2729.44 --> 2734.079
and how to deal with morality and

2732.319 --> 2737.2799999999997
situations all the

2734.079 --> 2741.119
it's this

2737.28 --> 2743.28
is the core of what i'm holding on to in

2741.119 --> 2747.839
christianity

2743.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
and beside that i'm kind of naturalist

2748.079 --> 2754.8
and at that part i do appreciate the old

2751.44 --> 2757.599
knowledge from paganism

2754.8 --> 2760.4
and i do not appreciate the ways of

2757.599 --> 2763.44
control of paganism

2760.4 --> 2767.44
that's part disgusting

2763.44 --> 2770.56
but they were gatherers of

2767.44 --> 2774.0
good tricks and discoveries especially

2770.56 --> 2777.119
in medicine

2774.0 --> 2779.599
and they had just

2777.119 --> 2780.6400000000003
very clear knowledge also of logos of

2779.599 --> 2784.1600000000003
what is critically

2780.64 --> 2785.7599999999998
important and they also had a of

2784.16 --> 2788.319
especially in the religion a great

2785.76 --> 2788.88
understanding of the need of a challenge

2788.319 --> 2791.2799999999997
and

2788.88 --> 2793.52
adulthood was very important and all

2791.28 --> 2793.52
that

2793.599 --> 2800.2400000000002
traditions those parts said see so

2797.76 --> 2800.8
i think they i don't even know what to

2800.24 --> 2803.68
call it

2800.8 --> 2805.28
what i am anymore i just try to take the

2803.68 --> 2808.319
best of everything and then

2805.28 --> 2809.2000000000003
try to unite it into something that is

2808.319 --> 2811.359
cohesive

2809.2 --> 2812.3999999999996
and in balance and that can stand the

2811.359 --> 2815.52
test of time

2812.4 --> 2817.599
even if there are minor conflicts within

2815.52 --> 2818.96
then those minor conflicts can deal with

2817.599 --> 2821.92
themselves

2818.96 --> 2824.88
without losing the entire cohesion that

2821.92 --> 2824.88
is my objective

2826.24 --> 2830.4799999999996
and that even freaking counts for the

2828.56 --> 2834.24
globe cosmology

2830.48 --> 2837.599
storytelling tradition versus the real

2834.24 --> 2837.5989999999997
flat earth cosmology

2838.48 --> 2843.2
that's why i say the the globe's not

2840.64 --> 2845.44
going away

2843.2 --> 2846.64
just because it's completely inside out

2845.44 --> 2850.0
world view

2846.64 --> 2850.0
doesn't mean it's going to go away

2853.44 --> 2859.839
thank you blackworm i appreciate that

2868.72 --> 2874.7999999999997
big bang isn't an explosion

2872.4 --> 2874.8
okay

2891.119 --> 2901.839
yeah thank you for picking that up

2906.8 --> 2909.8390000000004
well an explosion technically is

2908.88 --> 2911.839
pressure

2909.839 --> 2914.5589999999997
the detonation is a shock wave an

2911.839 --> 2916.72
explosion is a pressure wave

2914.559 --> 2916.7200000000003
so

2923.119 --> 2928.1600000000003
and light yeah doesn't really

2926.24 --> 2929.68
necessarily happen with the explosion

2928.16 --> 2933.7599999999998
it's usually the

2929.68 --> 2935.2799999999997
yeah the the extreme chemical energy

2933.76 --> 2937.44
that is going to create the light and

2935.28 --> 2939.2000000000003
that's why detonations cause a bright

2937.44 --> 2943.44
flash

2939.2 --> 2946.72
and explosions don't necessarily do

2943.44 --> 2948.8
that as much because it's more the

2946.72 --> 2957.839
ripping a part of the

2948.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
of the explosive case whatever that is

2958.48 --> 2962.2400000000002
the escape of the gas pressure

2965.92 --> 2970.48
what is in game in background of your

2968.96 --> 2974.88
video that's not a game

2970.48 --> 2976.64
it's a adam meekin made that

2974.88 --> 2977.92
he plucked it off the internet it's

2976.64 --> 2981.5989999999997
basically like

2977.92 --> 2985.839
an animated walk through a forest

2981.599 --> 2989.2000000000003
taken from a game i think that

2985.839 --> 2991.599
i don't know what it is but i

2989.2 --> 2992.8799999999997
if i think it kind of feels like it

2991.599 --> 2996.4
looks

2992.88 --> 2998.7200000000003
like from the oblivion era

2996.4 --> 3001.28
from the the game with moral wind

2998.72 --> 3001.2799999999997
oblivion

3003.28 --> 3008.559
what is it again you know before skyrim

3006.8 --> 3010.8390000000004
from that era it just looks like

3008.559 --> 3013.8390000000004
graphics from that era it's still pretty

3010.839 --> 3018.0789999999997
decent and it's just

3013.839 --> 3021.599
just a video clip that anime can

3018.079 --> 3021.599
plucked from the internet

3024.559 --> 3028.7200000000003
that's pretty decent graphic i agree

3037.04 --> 3041.04
like i can show it for a second just the

3039.92 --> 3046.0
full animation

3041.04 --> 3046.0
i'll do that see

3049.28 --> 3058.0
okay here we go

3054.8 --> 3059.599
nope forgot about that the video is

3058.0 --> 3061.92
still on there

3059.599 --> 3064.7200000000003
hold on i couldn't see it because it's

3061.92 --> 3064.7200000000003
not activated

3064.88 --> 3071.2000000000003
uh right media source one is after all

3080.839 --> 3083.839
right

3093.52 --> 3097.839
pretty cool right

3107.119 --> 3113.599
yeah you can find some incredible things

3110.079 --> 3125.8390000000004
on the internet and adam meekin

3113.599 --> 3125.839
happens to be very good at it

3131.52 --> 3135.7599999999998
a flight through the wilderness of one's

3133.52 --> 3137.119
natural mind i like that kevin horizons

3135.76 --> 3141.76
yeah

3137.119 --> 3144.8
well the thing is i've had like the most

3141.76 --> 3146.4
relieving moments spiritually relieving

3144.8 --> 3150.1600000000003
when i would just

3146.4 --> 3150.1600000000003
walk through a forest

3150.48 --> 3154.72
and that's what this is it's just

3153.04 --> 3157.44
walking through the forest actually kind

3154.72 --> 3157.4399999999996
of slowly

3162.64 --> 3166.24
so i thought yeah that's pretty that

3164.319 --> 3169.44
would be cool as a background and hey

3166.24 --> 3174.64
i am my name is arwyn

3169.44 --> 3174.64
it's it is said that i am an elf

3176.8 --> 3183.92
it's not strange because yeah

3181.119 --> 3186.4
favorite class of elves is widely

3183.92 --> 3190.2400000000002
established to be wizard

3186.4 --> 3192.559
in dnd i am also a game master and a

3190.24 --> 3195.7599999999998
great fan of dnd i literally

3192.559 --> 3198.3190000000004
wrote my own version of the book over a

3195.76 --> 3201.44
thousand pages that is free

3198.319 --> 3201.44
for use online

3201.52 --> 3205.2
that's called trolls and tyrants

3205.599 --> 3210.079
so yeah i'm very much into that also and

3208.8 --> 3212.0
i like elves

3210.079 --> 3213.52
and i think that elves have always been

3212.0 --> 3215.839
pooh-poohed too much

3213.52 --> 3216.559
except for legolas and lord of the rings

3215.839 --> 3219.52
who is like an

3216.559 --> 3223.8390000000004
overkill elf but then again he was kind

3219.52 --> 3223.839
of in the book as well

3224.079 --> 3229.6800000000003
and yeah i got a bow

3227.2 --> 3231.04
so yeah it's just what it is i'm

3229.68 --> 3234.48
literally my name

3231.04 --> 3237.359
is arwin it was given to me by my mother

3234.48 --> 3237.92
named after lord of the rings it has an

3237.359 --> 3241.5989999999997
elven

3237.92 --> 3244.64
meaning it's called friend of the eagle

3241.599 --> 3248.6400000000003
which is kind of fascinating in the face

3244.64 --> 3251.839
of everything

3248.64 --> 3251.839
just everything

3253.28 --> 3256.559
so yeah

3258.96 --> 3268.7200000000003
i am arwyn the elven wizard

3262.88 --> 3268.7200000000003
i guess you could call me a geomancer

3270.64 --> 3277.2799999999997
or maybe yeah cosmogen is

3274.24 --> 3280.64
it would be like a planar traveler yeah

3277.28 --> 3282.079
planar freaking traveler that's it plane

3280.64 --> 3284.8799999999997
shifter

3282.079 --> 3286.6400000000003
i even designed the class redesigned it

3284.88 --> 3288.079
because it was in the original monster

3286.64 --> 3289.5989999999997
manual

3288.079 --> 3291.3590000000004
no wait it wasn't there it's in the

3289.599 --> 3293.28
manual of the planes

3291.359 --> 3295.52
but i redesigned it because the

3293.28 --> 3299.599
potential for it was just too good

3295.52 --> 3302.0
no not arwen dude my name is on your

3299.599 --> 3302.0
screen

3302.319 --> 3308.88
my name is on the screen

3306.16 --> 3308.8799999999997
do you see it

3310.319 --> 3315.2799999999997
the icon it's right there

3317.68 --> 3322.64
right and technically i could have been

3319.92 --> 3325.6800000000003
the cousin

3322.64 --> 3328.0789999999997
or nephew what nephew of uh of irwin

3325.68 --> 3331.2
that's correct

3328.079 --> 3333.44
because in a way i am a half elf

3331.2 --> 3335.68
because my parents were very different

3333.44 --> 3337.119
my mother was more like a pure elf my

3335.68 --> 3341.2
dad's definitely more

3337.119 --> 3341.2000000000003
like a i don't know typical human

3342.24 --> 3346.839
although he does have like old jeans i

3345.68 --> 3350.72
guess

3346.839 --> 3352.96
like not aging so it is really like

3350.72 --> 3356.64
weird how that works out the

3352.96 --> 3356.64
metaphorical comparison

3361.119 --> 3368.6400000000003
yeah well arwyn

3365.119 --> 3368.6400000000003
is in half elven name

3370.319 --> 3374.72
my dad is confirmed just a typical human

3374.839 --> 3382.48
right but he is kind of also gondorian

3378.72 --> 3383.52
you know he is of yeah and that's what

3382.48 --> 3384.96
would then be

3383.52 --> 3386.96
not that he's like a superhuman

3384.96 --> 3389.04
definitely not he's very modest he's

3386.96 --> 3392.48
very modest guy

3389.04 --> 3395.359
but as i said he has the genes

3392.48 --> 3397.119
where we where we just last very long

3395.359 --> 3399.839
without shriveling up it's

3397.119 --> 3401.2000000000003
from indonesia i guess and yeah you

3399.839 --> 3404.16
could consider that

3401.2 --> 3405.359
growing older better longer life like

3404.16 --> 3408.799
the

3405.359 --> 3412.0
the numenoreans which were the ones

3408.799 --> 3413.04
that crossed with the elves to make the

3412.0 --> 3415.119
half elves

3413.04 --> 3417.119
it's not just regular humans it was the

3415.119 --> 3420.48
old humans the

3417.119 --> 3422.6400000000003
yeah the numenoreans

3420.48 --> 3425.599
that created the half elves not just

3422.64 --> 3425.5989999999997
regular people

3426.079 --> 3432.319
because numenoreans lived a lot longer

3430.24 --> 3434.8799999999997
they would still look pretty young when

3432.319 --> 3437.7599999999998
they were 100.

3434.88 --> 3438.96
so yes half elf half half elf you

3437.76 --> 3446.88
quarter elf

3438.96 --> 3450.64
what i don't know man

3446.88 --> 3450.6400000000003
i'm arwin and that's good enough

3453.71 --> 3458.16
[Applause]

3455.28 --> 3460.6400000000003
but yes it is it is very funny of me to

3458.16 --> 3463.44
say yeah yeah my dad is a typical human

3460.64 --> 3464.0789999999997
yeah i realize that is really funny

3463.44 --> 3475.839
thing

3464.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
to say

3477.92 --> 3482.0
no trolls and tyrants is not the game of

3480.079 --> 3485.2000000000003
the late 90s

3482.0 --> 3487.44
there's trolls and tunnels

3485.2 --> 3489.5989999999997
it was a board game sort of thing just

3487.44 --> 3494.96
like d d no no trolls and tyrants

3489.599 --> 3494.96
i made it i researched it i got the name

3496.72 --> 3506.9599999999996
guess when in 2000

3503.76 --> 3509.8390000000004
i think yeah 2010 so

3506.96 --> 3510.4
i knew like because that's it was my

3509.839 --> 3512.319
game

3510.4 --> 3517.839
instead of dungeons and dragons it's

3512.319 --> 3517.839
trolls and tyrants it's the new age

3518.4 --> 3522.2400000000002
tyrants are coming in the open and the

3520.4 --> 3525.2000000000003
trolls are roaming free

3522.24 --> 3527.9199999999996
that's what that's where we are that's

3525.2 --> 3527.9199999999996
what we're dealing

3529.04 --> 3532.16
me fly where's with thing

3536.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
i can't find my trolls and tire inside

3539.04 --> 3545.839
where is it

3548.64 --> 3559.839
i have too many bookmarks

3552.16 --> 3559.839
ah you should be here yes thank god

3561.2 --> 3565.4399999999996
right so i'll put the link of the trolls

3563.44 --> 3568.4
and tyrone site it's a wordpress site

3565.44 --> 3569.52
i used to have the original domain but i

3568.4 --> 3571.28
don't anymore

3569.52 --> 3572.88
it never really worked out so i just

3571.28 --> 3576.7200000000003
have this

3572.88 --> 3578.6400000000003
but yeah unfortunately some of the links

3576.72 --> 3580.5589999999997
don't work anymore because i'm a

3578.64 --> 3581.68
cheapskate and i've never given them a

3580.559 --> 3583.8390000000004
single fee

3581.68 --> 3585.52
so they just made ensure that i just

3583.839 --> 3586.0
couldn't upload files anymore even

3585.52 --> 3588.559
though you're

3586.0 --> 3589.2
supposed to be able to they just broke

3588.559 --> 3592.48
them

3589.2 --> 3594.24
because they are grably bastards that

3592.48 --> 3595.839
of course don't do anything for free

3594.24 --> 3598.24
they just like to make you

3595.839 --> 3600.48
think they do for free as they rip as

3598.24 --> 3602.72
much money out of you as they can

3600.48 --> 3602.72
right

3603.52 --> 3610.48
but yeah this is it and

3606.88 --> 3614.319
that's literally eight

3610.48 --> 3618.319
years over 10 000 hours ten thousand

3614.319 --> 3621.52
hours of technical construction

3618.319 --> 3624.72
because most of it is technical language

3621.52 --> 3625.839
is d technical descriptions i've made

3624.72 --> 3629.5989999999997
like

3625.839 --> 3633.119
200 new spells

3629.599 --> 3635.76
piles and like 200 new feats

3633.119 --> 3636.1600000000003
rearranged old systems reintegrated

3635.76 --> 3638.96
things

3636.16 --> 3639.92
made remade all the base classes all of

3638.96 --> 3642.4
them

3639.92 --> 3643.52
and added five new ones that i were

3642.4 --> 3646.079
originally prestige

3643.52 --> 3648.92
i rearranged some things made a whole

3646.079 --> 3652.079
bunch of prestige classes

3648.92 --> 3653.76
refabricated from scratch the entire

3652.079 --> 3657.119
skill system which is like

3653.76 --> 3660.3190000000004
my master piece very proud of that

3657.119 --> 3663.52
because i gave great depth up to absurd

3660.319 --> 3665.68
epic level options for everything

3663.52 --> 3666.72
and just worked it out much smoother

3665.68 --> 3670.5589999999997
yeah this is

3666.72 --> 3673.4399999999996
one of my life projects that i've not

3670.559 --> 3675.6800000000003
made a single cent off but i have used

3673.44 --> 3679.2000000000003
it to brag a lot

3675.68 --> 3681.1189999999997
in d circles like literally

3679.2 --> 3685.1189999999997
bringing up the book which i still i

3681.119 --> 3688.799
still have it

3685.119 --> 3688.799
it's an older version so it's highly

3696.839 --> 3701.7599999999998
outdated

3699.52 --> 3701.7599999999998
two

3706.079 --> 3715.92
all right two-parter

3712.64 --> 3715.92
extremely outdated

3716.079 --> 3721.3590000000004
and updated but yeah it's like this

3719.119 --> 3722.4
let's flick through it here's the list

3721.359 --> 3725.44
of feats

3722.4 --> 3728.799
oversight here's the fine description

3725.44 --> 3728.799
in alphabetical order

3733.2 --> 3737.5
as i said tens of thousands of hours of

3736.24 --> 3738.839
work

3737.5 --> 3742.4
[Applause]

3738.839 --> 3744.24
spells is mostly mates and wizard spells

3742.4 --> 3747.039
i just focused on those

3744.24 --> 3749.7599999999998
remade a lot i completely redefined

3747.039 --> 3753.44
telekinesis teleport

3749.76 --> 3756.96
and plane shifting to the inf detail

3753.44 --> 3759.559
where to basically completely fix

3756.96 --> 3762.2400000000002
every single problem with every

3759.559 --> 3764.48
cosmogonical factor

3762.24 --> 3767.0389999999998
so the interplanar situation i

3764.48 --> 3769.28
completely refined that

3767.039 --> 3771.2000000000003
so that it is very utilizable even at

3769.28 --> 3772.559
high levels without breaking the entire

3771.2 --> 3776.64
game

3772.559 --> 3780.4
so yeah this is only spells

3776.64 --> 3783.44
sick sick amounts absolutely psychotic

3780.4 --> 3786.48
amount of spells

3783.44 --> 3789.599
and there's now twice the amount by now

3786.48 --> 3789.599
oh god this is heavy

3790.22 --> 3797.2
[Music]

3792.799 --> 3801.92
god damn it that's many spells

3797.2 --> 3801.9199999999996
oh my god never stops

3804.4 --> 3811.2000000000003
right spell sheets to use as gamers

3807.44 --> 3815.68
i designed special ones for those

3811.2 --> 3819.4399999999996
other types of sheets ah the armory

3815.68 --> 3823.5989999999997
here are all the dnd weapons

3819.44 --> 3827.68
ever made ever made all put together in

3823.599 --> 3830.7200000000003
the armory in a giant

3827.68 --> 3833.0389999999998
table like oversight list

3830.72 --> 3834.0789999999997
on my computer this is much better it's

3833.039 --> 3836.96
like a giant

3834.079 --> 3839.039
spreadsheet so you can literally look up

3836.96 --> 3840.7200000000003
every single factor of every single

3839.039 --> 3842.3190000000004
piece of oh this is

3840.72 --> 3844.0
wait this is armor this is only or

3842.319 --> 3846.48
that's why it's not that big because i

3844.0 --> 3848.079
do also have a weaponry

3846.48 --> 3849.92
this is just the armor here that's the

3848.079 --> 3852.96
arsenal of course here

3849.92 --> 3855.599
that's all the normal weapons

3852.96 --> 3856.64
all the martial weapons simple weapons

3855.599 --> 3859.76
martial weapons and

3856.64 --> 3862.5589999999997
all the freaking exotic weapons

3859.76 --> 3863.119
so yeah and detailed description i

3862.559 --> 3865.2000000000003
barely

3863.119 --> 3866.7200000000003
adapted anything but i did create some

3865.2 --> 3870.0
new things i also created

3866.72 --> 3873.5989999999997
a complete set of renaissance weaponry

3870.0 --> 3876.24
including cannons and

3873.599 --> 3879.44
gunpowder to all make it balanced and

3876.24 --> 3882.8799999999997
sensible and developable

3879.44 --> 3885.599
right so that's one part oh my god this

3882.88 --> 3885.599
thing is heavy

3885.839 --> 3892.72
ah rule changes

3889.119 --> 3892.7200000000003
i'm not even going to explain that

3892.839 --> 3900.48
let's optional changes

3897.92 --> 3903.2000000000003
right and here's the masterpiece skill

3900.48 --> 3903.2
descriptions

3904.559 --> 3909.76
so yeah appraise balance bluff climb

3907.44 --> 3911.92

3927.44 --> 3932.96

3929.359 --> 3935.5989999999997
as per the standard 3.5 rules

3932.96 --> 3937.599
because i appreciated those too much it

3935.599 --> 3940.319
has been changed so much since then but

3937.599 --> 3944.799
it is basically a 3.5 based system

3940.319 --> 3949.68
or as i like to call it 3.87

3944.799 --> 3952.48
because that's yeah square root of pi

3949.68 --> 3954.64
wait no it is what is it it's eight

3952.48 --> 3955.44
seven no no it's the square root of 15

3954.64 --> 3957.1189999999997
that's why

3955.44 --> 3959.44
that's the amount of base classes that i

3957.119 --> 3963.119
have yeah i'm a nerd i know

3959.44 --> 3965.68
anyway skills descriptions

3963.119 --> 3968.1600000000003
very very oh my god this [ __ ] thing

3965.68 --> 3968.16
is heavy

3969.359 --> 3976.72
and yeah this

3972.4 --> 3980.64
amount of text here for the skills

3976.72 --> 3983.0389999999998
is literally eight

3980.64 --> 3984.5589999999997
times as much as the original amount

3983.039 --> 3987.6800000000003
that nobody

3984.559 --> 3989.119
ever updated nobody ever updated the

3987.68 --> 3991.5989999999997
skill function

3989.119 --> 3994.079
so i did it and i did it for like the

3991.599 --> 3997.119
next 20 years

3994.079 --> 3998.6800000000003
to simply allow anything that could be

3997.119 --> 4001.92
done through skills

3998.68 --> 4005.2
imaginable in here anything you could

4001.92 --> 4010.4
ever imagine to do with any skill

4005.2 --> 4010.3999999999996
can be found in this freaking system

4017.68 --> 4022.96
right and then we get the base classes

4019.52 --> 4025.839
assassin barbarian bard black guard

4022.96 --> 4027.44
cleric druid fighter monk paladin ranger

4025.839 --> 4031.359
rogue shadow dancer

4027.44 --> 4034.4
sorcerer wizard and a specialist wizard

4031.359 --> 4038.0789999999997
it's probably the most worked on

4034.4 --> 4040.559
but yeah including

4038.079 --> 4042.1600000000003
intro stories as to like what is

4040.559 --> 4045.52
typically

4042.16 --> 4046.72
associated with this i'm gonna round out

4045.52 --> 4049.839
the show by the way i know i'm

4046.72 --> 4053.0389999999998
going way over the time limit

4049.839 --> 4053.0389999999998
but i'm doing it anyway

4053.44 --> 4057.68
so i've had some intro texts but

4057.76 --> 4062.4
they have it has been a long time since

4060.0 --> 4065.52
i've updated them

4062.4 --> 4068.799
so they might be by my own

4065.52 --> 4071.92
description taste a little out of date

4068.799 --> 4074.079
but i thought it was just a good thing

4071.92 --> 4076.48
to basically have certain types of

4074.079 --> 4078.6400000000003
elements with each

4076.48 --> 4079.599
base class which is what players are

4078.64 --> 4082.24
going to take

4079.599 --> 4084.319
when they display the game to kind of

4082.24 --> 4084.799
you have a description of the feel for

4084.319 --> 4087.0389999999998
what

4084.799 --> 4088.16
their character would be like in certain

4087.039 --> 4091.28
scenarios

4088.16 --> 4092.16
like a barbarian where were they like it

4091.28 --> 4094.7200000000003
in nature

4092.16 --> 4096.159
what would be like in the city what type

4094.72 --> 4098.0
of social

4096.159 --> 4100.639999999999
position would they typically take in

4098.0 --> 4104.08
what are typical character

4100.64 --> 4107.04
types that appear among those based

4104.08 --> 4109.759
just all on logic so i balanced try to

4107.04 --> 4112.08
create a balance out story intro story

4109.759 --> 4112.799
for every single type of class so that

4112.08 --> 4114.88
you would

4112.799 --> 4116.96
always be able to get a feel of what

4114.88 --> 4121.839

4116.96 --> 4121.839
