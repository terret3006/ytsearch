154.92 --> 159.78
it's a nice and blue sky

157.62 --> 162.42000000000002
in between the rushing clouds because

159.78 --> 164.64000000000001
they're still rushing

162.42 --> 167.66
up there

164.64 --> 167.66
you might see that

168.3 --> 172.98000000000002
they're going pretty fast but also their

171.06 --> 174.9
the clouds seem to be kind of low

172.98 --> 177.66
hanging so

174.9 --> 180.08
that always does make them seem to go

177.66 --> 180.07999999999998
faster

180.239 --> 184.09900000000002

did roll out

793.68 --> 798.2399999999999
I had a lot of energy back then

796.38 --> 802.2
because I didn't do the show the day

798.24 --> 804.54
before and that really does like add up

802.2 --> 807.0600000000001
that's why yesterday was such a flat

804.54 --> 809.48
Earth versus Globe Earth and a lot of

807.06 --> 809.4799999999999
Baldwin

1477.38 --> 1483.22
here so far but I'm just going to be

1480.02 --> 1483.22
Semitic neutral

1486.86 --> 1490.8799999999999
and yes at some point I'm probably going

1489.02 --> 1494.08
to use that as a title when it's really

1490.88 --> 1494.0800000000002
become the subject

1494.96 --> 1500.8400000000001
maybe today maybe not

1497.78 --> 1504.799
but yeah I like to say yeah how about

1500.84 --> 1507.62
just being Semitic neutral

1504.799 --> 1509.12
I mean that's like a whole revolution in

1507.62 --> 1511.52
this age because either you're

1509.12 --> 1513.26
anti-semitic or you're super pro-semitic

1511.52 --> 1516.6399999999999
well I'm just

1513.26 --> 1516.64
Semitic neutral

1519.21 --> 1533.72
[Music]

1530.779 --> 1536.419
yeah staying neutral but just staying

1533.72 --> 1539.6000000000001
neutral you gotta you've got to then

1536.419 --> 1542.24
call it Semitic neutral if somebody goes

1539.6 --> 1545.6589999999999
anti-semitic or pro-israel is like no

1542.24 --> 1548.059
I'm being Semitic neutral

1545.659 --> 1549.74
I'm not not like oh I'm staring out of

1548.059 --> 1552.3799999999999
it like some chicken who's just trying

1549.74 --> 1553.58
to hide no no you have a very specific

1552.38 --> 1557.9
position

1553.58 --> 1559.9399999999998
I'm neutral about that Semitic neutral

1557.9 --> 1562.039
I'm trying to make it a thing I have no

1559.94 --> 1563.24
idea where that that's probably gonna

1562.039 --> 1566.48
fizzle

1563.24 --> 1568.659
but I thought it was really funny

1566.48 --> 1568.659
okay

1569.24 --> 1573.86
I had it in response I figured yeah I

1572.0 --> 1575.96

when they go out there just staring in

2563.56 --> 2568.2999999999997

sugar being put in a lot of stuff has

2597.7 --> 2601.02
been around for a long time

2617.619 --> 2621.7000000000003

2619.119 --> 2625.96
it's actually a more recent development

2621.7 --> 2628.48
that sugar has been recognized as

2625.96 --> 2632.579
bad as it is and that there are even

2628.48 --> 2637.06
products especially in the organic food

2632.579 --> 2641.079
regions that sector where they're they

2637.06 --> 2644.0789999999997
account for low sugar a lot

2641.079 --> 2645.76
they don't replace it with aspartame and

2644.079 --> 2649.96
that kind of crap

2645.76 --> 2653.3190000000004
right but they just go low sugar so

2649.96 --> 2656.38
there's much more awareness of it now in

2653.319 --> 2658.359

it is poison it's literally poison

2689.26 --> 2696.46
as pertain was actually developed as

2692.619 --> 2698.6800000000003

no sugar in it it only has all these

2751.359 --> 2756.04

2793.18 --> 2802.18
in your body

2795.76 --> 2804.78
among one was a pretty high levels of

2802.18 --> 2807.94
what's it called again

2804.78 --> 2811.7200000000003
formaldehyde yeah it literally breaks

2807.94 --> 2811.7200000000003
down into formaldehyde

2812.56 --> 2817.66
and like

2813.819 --> 2820.2
bad forms of alcohol too yeah so yeah

2817.66 --> 2823.96
you it actually aspartame breaks down

2820.2 --> 2828.2999999999997
partially into alcohol

2823.96 --> 2828.3
it's really freaky stuff

2829.18 --> 2836.02
any citations for the Warfare origin how

2832.78 --> 2838.96
about Wikipedia you dummy

2836.02 --> 2842.04
this is public knowledge I've known this

2838.96 --> 2842.04
for 20 years

2845.5 --> 2849.7
yeah

2846.88 --> 2852.04
20 years it's like one of the first

2849.7 --> 2855.54
things I've learned that pushed me into

2852.04 --> 2855.54
going full organic

2859.54 --> 2865.8
why don't you actually like

2862.9 --> 2872.02
look into Wikipedia look for

2865.8 --> 2874.96
aspartame nutress Suite Donald rumsfelt

2872.02 --> 2879.46
look it up Google a combination of those

2874.96 --> 2881.619
words you will find the official history

2879.46 --> 2884.859
it's official

2881.619 --> 2888.2200000000003
so no citations then except it is public

2884.859 --> 2889.72
knowledge that's officially admitted

2888.22 --> 2893.68
I mean

2889.72 --> 2896.74
you could literally like contact

2893.68 --> 2899.859
Nutra suite and ask them the awkward

2896.74 --> 2902.3799999999997
question and they will admit it's true

2899.859 --> 2905.02
because it is

2902.38 --> 2907.079
officially admitted

2905.02 --> 2907.079
yeah

2908.14 --> 2913.48
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

2909.94 --> 2916.66
citations it's a it's admitted why don't

2913.48 --> 2919.119
you go ask Donald Rumsfeld he did it

2916.66 --> 2922.0789999999997
I think he's still proud of it if he's

2919.119 --> 2922.079
still alive I don't know

2922.599 --> 2928.3
but yeah that that really happened

2926.44 --> 2930.96
they thought it was a revolutionary

2928.3 --> 2930.96
discovery

2932.56 --> 2940.56
but it is really discovered during

2936.88 --> 2940.56
chemical warfare

2941.079 --> 2947.26
development that's when they discovered

2943.359 --> 2951.4
it it's that's really true

2947.26 --> 2953.92
during the Iraqi Warfare in the 90s it's

2951.4 --> 2956.46
really true

2953.92 --> 2956.46
foreign

2964.3 --> 2967.079
no

2968.2 --> 2972.7599999999998
not really

2969.94 --> 2976.2290000000003
what you can think of getting it back

2972.76 --> 2976.2290000000003
[Music]

2981.16 --> 2985.83
[Music]

2991.48 --> 2997.18
the delusion of derps yeah it seems even

2994.3 --> 3000.2400000000002
just rudimentary facts

2997.18 --> 3002.0989999999997
of societal rudimentary facts that are

3000.24 --> 3006.2599999999998
officially admitted and that you can

3002.099 --> 3006.26
literally just look up on Wikipedia

3006.42 --> 3010.859
right this is not about something

3008.16 --> 3013.14
technical or something scientific this

3010.859 --> 3016.14
is history

3013.14 --> 3019.68
yeah this is history is like just the

3016.14 --> 3021.2999999999997
history of the corporation NutraSweet

3019.68 --> 3024.2999999999997
just look it up it's official history

3021.3 --> 3027.42
I'm so sorry but that's the reality

3024.3 --> 3030.2400000000002
that's the world you live in that's real

3027.42 --> 3032.1800000000003
you're gonna have to face it the world

3030.24 --> 3034.02
is not all

3032.18 --> 3035.7599999999998
sweet

3034.02 --> 3039.18
pun intended

3035.76 --> 3041.8190000000004
yeah it isn't

3039.18 --> 3045.319
crazy [ __ ] happens and then everybody

3041.819 --> 3045.319
just goes along with it

3045.41 --> 3052.7799999999997
[Music]

3058.02 --> 3064.319
Wiki is a source now

3061.22 --> 3066.1189999999997
[Music]

3064.319 --> 3068.22
doesn't mean that everything that's on

3066.119 --> 3071.46
there is correct especially when it

3068.22 --> 3074.7599999999998
comes to well things like Coriolis

3071.46 --> 3077.28
effect that's just blatantly in your

3074.76 --> 3079.8590000000004
face wrongs for you to figure out

3077.28 --> 3081.7200000000003
but that thing about Nutra suite and

3079.859 --> 3083.16
Donald's Rumsfeld and the origins of

3081.72 --> 3085.98
aspartame

3083.16 --> 3089.24
just history that's literally true

3085.98 --> 3092.88
literary it is not like oh

3089.24 --> 3095.7599999999998
dangerous or not dangerous or this could

3092.88 --> 3101.1600000000003
be no no this is not about chemistry or

3095.76 --> 3101.1600000000003
speculation this is just history

3101.3 --> 3107.119
like register

3104.059 --> 3109.4
official history

3107.119 --> 3112.6800000000003
not really

3109.4 --> 3115.44
disclaimed by anybody involved

3112.68 --> 3117.72
yeah they kind of kept it under the

3115.44 --> 3119.579
wraps because they thought like oh if we

3117.72 --> 3121.68
just overtly tell them we got this out

3119.579 --> 3125.3390000000004
of chemical warfare

3121.68 --> 3127.6189999999997
wouldn't be have been as appealing

3125.339 --> 3129.839
but they didn't like

3127.619 --> 3132.48
yeah after a while

3129.839 --> 3134.7
the industry kind of moved on and asked

3132.48 --> 3137.04
like the dangers of aspartame were kind

3134.7 --> 3138.7799999999997
of being recognized kept under the under

3137.04 --> 3140.88
the rug

3138.78 --> 3142.619
and then it kind of like Get got the

3140.88 --> 3145.98
other versions like the other types of

3142.619 --> 3149.88
aspartame develop out of it and the

3145.98 --> 3153.079
whole bunch of stuff developed right the

3149.88 --> 3156.48
organic food industry kind of rose up

3153.079 --> 3158.7000000000003
similarly maybe even in response to that

3156.48 --> 3160.079
response to the recognition that wow

3158.7 --> 3162.18
they're just introducing chemical

3160.079 --> 3165.119
warfare agents in the standard food

3162.18 --> 3169.44
cycle now we gotta counter this

3165.119 --> 3173.4
really that it it Rose simultaneously

3169.44 --> 3176.94
I was there I was there when it happened

3173.4 --> 3179.52
in the 90s okay

3176.94 --> 3181.8
and yeah

3179.52 --> 3183.96
right now it's just like yeah it's just

3181.8 --> 3186.48
history that's just what happened

3183.96 --> 3188.04
I mean it's just the history like what

3186.48 --> 3190.079
happened in the Marshall Islands that

3188.04 --> 3193.02
they sent back natives

3190.079 --> 3194.52
just to see what plutonium poisoning

3193.02 --> 3195.66
would do to them

3194.52 --> 3198.3
yeah

3195.66 --> 3200.819
I mean nobody's proud of that

3198.3 --> 3205.52
okay I bet ya

3200.819 --> 3208.2
but it's official history it happened

3205.52 --> 3210.3
well guess what

3208.2 --> 3213.0
there's people in the Marshall Islands

3210.3 --> 3214.8
getting poisoned by plutonium that

3213.0 --> 3220.14
officially happened you know what else

3214.8 --> 3222.0
happened Donald Rumsfeld used a chemical

3220.14 --> 3224.0989999999997
warfare agent

3222.0 --> 3226.98
for the food industry as a sugar

3224.099 --> 3230.839
replacement and they called it aspartame

3226.98 --> 3230.839
that's official history

3239.94 --> 3242.54
foreign

3246.839 --> 3252.9
yeah oh there you go PGC net see it's

3250.319 --> 3256.64
it's not that hard

3252.9 --> 3256.64
but this is just these derps here

3257.22 --> 3262.4599999999996
they just they don't want to know

3260.22 --> 3264.48
you really like your

3262.46 --> 3267.14
Coca-Cola light

3264.48 --> 3270.859
new you you like your Google

3267.14 --> 3274.319
you like how it feels

3270.859 --> 3277.94
chemical warfare stories [ __ ] except

3274.319 --> 3277.94
it's officially recognized

3282.18 --> 3288.5
who's defending aspartame

3285.24 --> 3288.5
well the industry is

3289.559 --> 3293.059
Coca-Cola company is

3293.76 --> 3298.7400000000002
they still defend

3296.22 --> 3301.7599999999998
aspartame

3298.74 --> 3301.7599999999998
because they use it

3305.119 --> 3310.859
uh you do our misinformation troll you

3308.579 --> 3315.559
need to get the [ __ ] out of here

3310.859 --> 3315.5589999999997
get the [ __ ] out of my chat you scumbag

3316.68 --> 3319.16
yeah

3319.26 --> 3325.1400000000003
go back to your

3321.359 --> 3327.5699999999997
political Think Tank basement

3325.14 --> 3328.7599999999998
you little scumbag

3327.57 --> 3332.48
[Music]

3328.76 --> 3332.48
lying bastard

3336.59 --> 3339.84
[Music]

3341.22 --> 3347.8799999999997
anyway I've said what I needed to say

3343.8 --> 3348.96
several times very clear-cut

3347.88 --> 3351.96
yeah

3348.96 --> 3354.68
very clear-cut not over elaborating not

3351.96 --> 3357.78
adding anything on just keeping it super

3354.68 --> 3361.859
rudimentary how I learned it

3357.78 --> 3364.2000000000003
how I at the time looked it all up

3361.859 --> 3366.5989999999997
it's like one of my first research

3364.2 --> 3368.8799999999997
projects

3366.599 --> 3371.099
on the internet

3368.88 --> 3373.2000000000003
thanks to Alex Jones who kind of was the

3371.099 --> 3376.76
first person that shoved that into my

3373.2 --> 3376.7599999999998
face very early days

3376.92 --> 3383.04
okay

3379.38 --> 3385.26
so yeah I mean

3383.04 --> 3387.7799999999997
it's like my first project as a

3385.26 --> 3391.94
conspiracy theorist

3387.78 --> 3391.94
I know like everything about it

3403.74 --> 3407.4599999999996
you didn't know the history of the s410

3405.54 --> 3409.2
oh you learned something new every day

3407.46 --> 3411.42
don't you especially on the Flat Earth

3409.2 --> 3416.46
early bird show

3411.42 --> 3416.46
I learned this in like 2007.

3417.359 --> 3424.619
and it was actually during my lifetime

3420.48 --> 3427.2
happening in the 90s I still remember

3424.619 --> 3429.1800000000003
my mother actually getting enthusiastic

3427.2 --> 3434.339
about aspartame

3429.18 --> 3439.0989999999997
because of her tendency for diabetes

3434.339 --> 3443.4
so aspartame might have actually been

3439.099 --> 3446.099
a factor in screwing up her system

3443.4 --> 3448.8
we have to admit I've taken some of

3446.099 --> 3450.9
those aspartame thingies myself as a

3448.8 --> 3453.8390000000004
teen

3450.9 --> 3455.76
didn't seem like it did anything I

3453.839 --> 3457.859
didn't like oh I'm gonna take us for

3455.76 --> 3459.6800000000003
tape now every day no no no it's just

3457.859 --> 3461.94
sometimes I wanted to like these stupid

3459.68 --> 3464.2799999999997
tablets and I just like I want to feel

3461.94 --> 3466.98
something extremely sweet but it was

3464.28 --> 3468.9
actually gross so I only did that like a

3466.98 --> 3470.52
couple of times in a weird impulses and

3468.9 --> 3473.1600000000003
all that

3470.52 --> 3474.42
like to think that I was not damaged too

3473.16 --> 3477.0
much by it

3474.42 --> 3479.64
but my mother did like take it regularly

3477.0 --> 3482.42
for quite a while that must not have

3479.64 --> 3482.42
been good for her

3485.94 --> 3491.119
no Warfare connections what the hell are

3488.52 --> 3491.119
you talking about

3491.22 --> 3496.74
it was developed

3493.14 --> 3498.98
originally for utilization in the Gulf

3496.74 --> 3498.9799999999996
War

3499.319 --> 3503.119
remember Saddam Hussein

3508.859 --> 3513.54
foreign

3511.099 --> 3516.26
maybe you don't you probably weren't

3513.54 --> 3516.2599999999998
even born then

3516.78 --> 3519.48
I don't know

3517.84 --> 3521.1600000000003
[Music]

3519.48 --> 3522.839
of course there's a Warfare connection

3521.16 --> 3526.64
why do you think they would be

3522.839 --> 3526.64
developing such a substance

3529.799 --> 3536.16
why do you develop substances like that

3533.52 --> 3538.7
that are extremely toxic why would you

3536.16 --> 3538.7
do that

3540.66 --> 3543.2
foreign

3551.18 --> 3555.299
artificial sweetness don't help if

3553.079 --> 3557.28
you're trying to avoid diabetes Well Ari

3555.299 --> 3558.72
knuckle Womble that might be well known

3557.28 --> 3561.5400000000004
now

3558.72 --> 3563.8799999999997
it wasn't well known in the 90s okay

3561.54 --> 3566.339
when it just came out

3563.88 --> 3570.1800000000003
nobody knew anything about it

3566.339 --> 3572.16
people didn't know what it was they just

3570.18 --> 3575.04
knew oh it's a sugar replacement and

3572.16 --> 3576.54
sugar was steadily being recognized as

3575.04 --> 3579.18
being a problem

3576.54 --> 3581.339
because there's sugar in everything that

3579.18 --> 3584.64
was back then too as I said it's been

3581.339 --> 3586.92
like that for like a hundred years

3584.64 --> 3591.96
and like steadily getting worse right

3586.92 --> 3595.2000000000003
more sugar more addiction more sales

3591.96 --> 3597.299
and that then changed but it changed

3595.2 --> 3600.14
also with these freaky sugar

3597.299 --> 3600.14
replacements

3613.799 --> 3619.22
ah there you go thank you only the

3616.799 --> 3619.22
lonely

3620.46 --> 3625.02
okay

3622.02 --> 3625.02
the 70s

3629.46 --> 3632.299
way

3634.74 --> 3638.18
was it in the 70s

3642.55 --> 3646.02
[Music]

3643.68 --> 3647.22
okay but that's a bit odd

3646.02 --> 3648.599
because

3647.22 --> 3650.52
what

3648.599 --> 3653.4
that makes no sense there was absolutely

3650.52 --> 3655.559
no sign of any Gulf War back then

3653.4 --> 3658.079
what's the 70s then it would have to do

3655.559 --> 3659.7000000000003
with Vietnam did they did they test it

3658.079 --> 3663.02
in Vietnam then

3659.7 --> 3663.02
or in Korea

3663.299 --> 3667.74
well that's weird I always thought it

3664.92 --> 3670.02
was like during the Gulf War

3667.74 --> 3672.359
is

3670.02 --> 3674.579
maybe I misremember it

3672.359 --> 3676.7
or maybe it was told incorrectly I don't

3674.579 --> 3676.7000000000003
know

3676.799 --> 3680.059
tested in Iran

3681.78 --> 3688.8590000000004
right but okay so I might have misplaced

3684.72 --> 3691.6189999999997
the timing of when they actually used it

3688.859 --> 3693.72
where what I do still distinctly

3691.619 --> 3695.46
remember that it was originally a

3693.72 --> 3697.3799999999997
chemical warfare agent that's what it

3695.46 --> 3700.68
was developed for and then figured out

3697.38 --> 3702.599
hey it's kind of sweet weird

3700.68 --> 3706.68
and then

3702.599 --> 3709.26
formed the corporation NutraSweet

3706.68 --> 3712.94
as a sugar replacement that still stands

3709.26 --> 3712.94
I might have had the timing wrong

3713.819 --> 3720.119
all right

3716.22 --> 3723.319
yeah it was released in the 90s that was

3720.119 --> 3723.319
during the Gulf War

3725.04 --> 3729.7799999999997
maybe I just kind of linked that up

3727.2 --> 3731.52
together and with the Cold War syndrome

3729.78 --> 3734.3390000000004
and all that

3731.52 --> 3738.2599999999998
but maybe it was developed earlier in in

3734.339 --> 3738.2599999999998
like Vietnam or something I don't know

3748.92 --> 3751.92
83.

3752.099 --> 3757.1600000000003
right so it was just before the Gulf War

3754.799 --> 3757.16
then

3761.46 --> 3765.78
hmm

3763.74 --> 3768.74
anyway thanks for all the backup

3765.78 --> 3768.7400000000002
research here

3771.66 --> 3775.8799999999997
right but this is yeah it's real

3779.56 --> 3783.13
[Music]

3797.76 --> 3802.7090000000003
come on

3799.44 --> 3802.709
[Music]

3807.21 --> 3819.8
[Laughter]

3808.08 --> 3819.7999999999997
[Music]

3827.4 --> 3830.4
foreign

3835.84 --> 3839.03
[Music]

3846.76 --> 3850.5
[Music]

3847.94 --> 3853.76
it might have not been in the 90s it

3850.5 --> 3853.76
might have been in the 80s

3853.799 --> 3856.799
foreign

3864.72 --> 3869.2799999999997
it's a long time ago

3867.119 --> 3870.48
and back then I wasn't that's the weird

3869.28 --> 3872.94
thing like

3870.48 --> 3875.66
even during my teens I just wasn't all

3872.94 --> 3875.66
that interested

3875.7 --> 3880.4399999999996
I was always like no no like my parents

3878.339 --> 3882.72
will know that I don't know I don't

3880.44 --> 3884.64
really I didn't I wouldn't really care I

3882.72 --> 3888.359
just thought like oh if it's so sold in

3884.64 --> 3890.5789999999997
the store that it must be okay

3888.359 --> 3894.0589999999997
yeah

3890.579 --> 3897.079
yeah no longer

3894.059 --> 3897.079
feel like that

3911.339 --> 3916.02
brain cancer

3913.02 --> 3916.02
ouch yep

3922.26 --> 3927.3590000000004
and it's also known that you can go

3925.079 --> 3931.02
blind from it did did you

3927.359 --> 3933.72
because uh specifically because of the

3931.02 --> 3936.5
bad alcohol

3933.72 --> 3936.5
it's like

3937.079 --> 3940.799
you I think it's your liver it splits it

3939.42 --> 3941.66
up in

3940.799 --> 3943.2599999999998
um

3941.66 --> 3945.839
formaldehyde

3943.26 --> 3947.88
and I mentioned before and the bad

3945.839 --> 3950.339
alcohol which I guess that will be

3947.88 --> 3954.5
called wood alcohol and that is

3950.339 --> 3954.5
notorious for making you blind

3955.26 --> 3961.2200000000003
the ethanol right

3958.14 --> 3961.22
so yeah

3963.359 --> 3966.2
it's crazy

3974.48 --> 3978.2
methanol right

3982.559 --> 3990.059
so yeah aspartame bad news don't take it

3987.24 --> 3993.2599999999998
don't take anything that sounds like

3990.059 --> 3993.26
aspartame actually

3994.319 --> 3999.24
just

3996.9 --> 4001.579
just don't do it just don't take

3999.24 --> 4004.0389999999998
something then with sugar if you really

4001.579 --> 4006.8590000000004
want to avoid sugar well the best thing

4004.039 --> 4010.6600000000003
to do it is to make things yourself and

4006.859 --> 4010.66
then leave the sugar out

4014.0 --> 4017.799
hey enemy can I see you

4024.01 --> 4028.059
[Music]

4025.4 --> 4028.059
all right

4029.18 --> 4034.4199999999996
[Music]

4055.24 --> 4059.02
anyway yeah

4060.319 --> 4062.319
um

4072.079 --> 4075.079
what

4080.0 --> 4084.84
never heard of that one only the lonely

4082.28 --> 4088.0190000000002
are you sure about that

4084.84 --> 4088.0190000000002
[Music]

4093.82 --> 4099.339
[Music]

4096.92 --> 4099.339
foreign

4115.759 --> 4120.52
okay so let me get this straight then

4122.359 --> 4129.9800000000005
it was discovered in the 70s by accident

4126.64 --> 4132.1990000000005
then later

4129.98 --> 4135.44
applied

4132.199 --> 4137.178999999999
as chemical warfare agent

4135.44 --> 4141.04
and then

4137.179 --> 4141.04
turned into a sugar replacement

4144.38 --> 4147.1
hmm

4153.859 --> 4160.46
but also I'm pretty sure also it was

4156.199 --> 4162.5599999999995
never actually applied to the field

4160.46 --> 4165.44
I think

4162.56 --> 4167.839000000001
maybe yeah might be incorrect by that

4165.44 --> 4170.239
but I thought that like as a actual

4167.839 --> 4172.219
chemical agent they never used it in

4170.239 --> 4174.919999999999
Warfare

4172.219 --> 4177.92
and I heard but this might all turn out

4174.92 --> 4180.319
to be rumors from the times that they

4177.92 --> 4182.4800000000005
were about to do that

4180.319 --> 4185.4800000000005
like in Iraq

4182.48 --> 4187.879999999999
and then somebody redlighted it and they

4185.48 --> 4190.2789999999995
didn't do it after all

4187.88 --> 4194.06
and I think they did some gay bomb

4190.279 --> 4197.06
instead the other weird [ __ ]

4194.06 --> 4197.06
foreign

4212.67 --> 4215.899
[Music]

4219.98 --> 4224.959999999999
it took a long time before it even

4222.26 --> 4227.62
became considered to become legal in

4224.96 --> 4227.62
other countries

4227.96 --> 4230.62
right

4231.62 --> 4234.28
anyway

4247.4 --> 4256.159
but did I get it right I mean is that

4252.44 --> 4258.82
I was certain that as for tables

4256.159 --> 4258.82
originally

4259.46 --> 4264.44
developed

4261.679 --> 4267.4
like made in large quantities for

4264.44 --> 4267.4
chemical warfare

4268.83 --> 4275.96
[Music]

4279.06 --> 4282.219
[Music]

4297.8 --> 4300.8
hmm

4305.42 --> 4310.58
that's just weird

4307.64 --> 4312.14
I might be subjected to a weird Mandela

4310.58 --> 4315.76
effect here

4312.14 --> 4315.76
for myself by the way

4316.52 --> 4320.26
seem to remember it like that

4321.38 --> 4328.34
but maybe it was kind of like a hyped

4324.739 --> 4331.218999999999
rumor just to push it more through

4328.34 --> 4335.6
and you could still say that it is well

4331.219 --> 4338.0
as a sweetener being employed as a

4335.6 --> 4340.64
chemical warfare agent I mean that is

4338.0 --> 4343.159
technically kind of true

4340.64 --> 4345.08
but it's weird in my memory I was

4343.159 --> 4349.54
certain that it was actually going to be

4345.08 --> 4349.54
like sprayed by planes or something

4360.739 --> 4364.239
this is so odd

4372.92 --> 4376.58
right

4374.36 --> 4379.58
maybe I'll just leave to have to leave

4376.58 --> 4381.739
that part out in my mind

4379.58 --> 4384.5599999999995
maybe I mix it up at the time I mean I

4381.739 --> 4386.9
did learn it right in the peak of like

4384.56 --> 4390.9400000000005
when I first lifted that Veil and it

4386.9 --> 4390.94
made me quite crazy I can tell you

4391.1 --> 4398.2390000000005
I mean I was absolutely terrified

4395.0 --> 4400.28
watching Alex Jones I had like

4398.239 --> 4403.339999999999
a year long where I would just be

4400.28 --> 4405.8
watching it and like getting sweat

4403.34 --> 4407.06
attacked attacks because it was that

4405.8 --> 4409.76
scary

4407.06 --> 4411.9800000000005
to me because I was not used to it it

4409.76 --> 4414.219
felt like I was suddenly inside of a

4411.98 --> 4414.218999999999
secret

4414.44 --> 4418.879999999999
yeah spy Network or something and it is

4417.32 --> 4422.139999999999
really kind of what it was like

4418.88 --> 4422.14
especially at first

4422.91 --> 4429.159
[Music]

4424.76 --> 4429.159000000001
like the first decade especially

4432.62 --> 4437.719
but I might have misremembered this part

4436.159 --> 4440.239
that's weird

4437.719 --> 4442.94
that it is as a sweetener used as

4440.239 --> 4446.0
chemical warfare on the people but it

4442.94 --> 4449.599999999999
wasn't like literally used as a chemical

4446.0 --> 4451.34
warfare bombardment agent but in my mind

4449.6 --> 4454.9400000000005
I thought it

4451.34 --> 4459.6990000000005
I I must have just like

4454.94 --> 4459.699
had the hype made the connection

4460.36 --> 4466.839999999999
yeah you can [ __ ] off yeah I'm just

4464.0 --> 4466.84
being honest here

4468.98 --> 4473.239
I really do think I Mandela affected

4471.56 --> 4476.3
this

4473.239 --> 4479.54
it's like yeah it is used as a chemical

4476.3 --> 4482.360000000001
warfare agent not as an official one in

4479.54 --> 4484.04
a war and somehow in my mind I

4482.36 --> 4487.94
remembered it like that

4484.04 --> 4490.82
it's like two separate things and then I

4487.94 --> 4493.219
made them into one in my memory I might

4490.82 --> 4495.259999999999
have basically over memorized it like

4493.219 --> 4497.78
that

4495.26 --> 4500.4800000000005
yeah and that also because of the

4497.78 --> 4502.88
freaking Gulf War syndrome you know I

4500.48 --> 4503.659
mean that doesn't make it confusing at

4502.88 --> 4506.92
all

4503.659 --> 4506.92
holy [ __ ]

4508.52 --> 4512.860000000001
I must have like cross-connected it

4519.86 --> 4524.48
weird

4521.84 --> 4526.88
but good good to know get good to get it

4524.48 --> 4528.98
out in the open so that I can get it

4526.88 --> 4531.32
straight

4528.98 --> 4533.839999999999
so that I don't Mendel laugh that

4531.32 --> 4536.719
mistake it again

4533.84 --> 4539.900000000001
because I really think that is that

4536.719 --> 4542.3
think it's because of the hype

4539.9 --> 4545.9
not being used to that sort of thing

4542.3 --> 4548.6
right it's like remember the first half

4545.9 --> 4551.179
year when you figured out that the Earth

4548.6 --> 4553.84
was flat what that did to you remember

4551.179 --> 4553.84
that guys

4555.02 --> 4561.9800000000005
it was kind of like that except

4558.44 --> 4564.98
much scarier because it was the entire

4561.98 --> 4569.36
world basically flipping inside out and

4564.98 --> 4572.86
the evil revealing itself overtly to me

4569.36 --> 4577.58
where before that time I had always

4572.86 --> 4581.0
completely hit it completely in it you

4577.58 --> 4585.86
see so opening that door of Alex Jones

4581.0 --> 4589.219
was really [ __ ] terrifying like sweat

4585.86 --> 4591.92
inducing terrifying where I would become

4589.219 --> 4596.4800000000005
paranoid towards my fellow human really

4591.92 --> 4599.54
badly at first really badly

4596.48 --> 4602.599999999999
not that it let me to like get arrested

4599.54 --> 4604.4
or go hysterical in public but it was a

4602.6 --> 4606.38
miserable time because it was suddenly

4604.4 --> 4608.78
like holy [ __ ]

4606.38 --> 4611.96
this world is so [ __ ] up people have

4608.78 --> 4616.46
no idea what the hell this all is

4611.96 --> 4618.8
okay right an exaggerated reaction but

4616.46 --> 4622.76
still very natural and yeah that

4618.8 --> 4626.06
freaking makes you mix up things

4622.76 --> 4629.2390000000005
and so I misremembered it it's like the

4626.06 --> 4633.7390000000005
first thing I learned in there aspartame

4629.239 --> 4636.919999999999
chemical warfare agent Gulf War syndrome

4633.739 --> 4639.739
but then in my mind it's somehow became

4636.92 --> 4641.9
also like it was literally deployed as a

4639.739 --> 4645.08
chemical warfare agent like on the field

4641.9 --> 4647.239
of a war somehow

4645.08 --> 4649.28
that's how it formed in my mind it's

4647.239 --> 4651.98
weird

4649.28 --> 4654.159
because apparently that didn't happen I

4651.98 --> 4654.159
guess

4661.82 --> 4666.739
it's just funny how the memory works

4663.98 --> 4668.78
sometimes but still hey yeah me getting

4666.739 --> 4670.639999999999
that little detail slightly wrong

4668.78 --> 4673.4
through some personal Mandela effect

4670.64 --> 4676.46
doesn't mean that it isn't really

4673.4 --> 4678.32
important to know about aspartame

4676.46 --> 4683.12
[Music]

4678.32 --> 4685.219
and that it is actually quite dangerous

4683.12 --> 4687.199
and that since then there has been

4685.219 --> 4690.7390000000005
massive amounts of recognition for that

4687.199 --> 4693.799999999999
I mean if you now Google aspartame

4690.739 --> 4696.5599999999995
you'll get piles and piles of Articles

4693.8 --> 4697.9400000000005
of showing the the extreme dangers of it

4696.56 --> 4701.2390000000005
yeah

4697.94 --> 4703.339999999999
and which is interesting by the way it

4701.239 --> 4705.739
is why

4703.34 --> 4708.32
because

4705.739 --> 4712.4
15 years ago

4708.32 --> 4714.739
if you Google it or when a search engine

4712.4 --> 4717.98
in whatever it was back then if you try

4714.739 --> 4722.0599999999995
to find it on the internet back then

4717.98 --> 4725.48
you wouldn't find these articles

4722.06 --> 4728.42
yeah because back then they put a lid on

4725.48 --> 4730.5199999999995
it just like they do now with the things

4728.42 --> 4732.92
that now come out and that are like over

4730.52 --> 4735.1990000000005
sensitive and then oh it's not you get

4732.92 --> 4738.62
sniped if you talk about it

4735.199 --> 4739.58
by the platform well back then that sort

4738.62 --> 4743.08
of happened

4739.58 --> 4743.08
with the aspartame

4743.42 --> 4749.54
and other subjects too chemtrails

4747.08 --> 4752.179
uh

4749.54 --> 4754.58
flu vaccines at the time because yeah

4752.179 --> 4757.52
that's been a long-term issue

4754.58 --> 4759.679
but the aspartame also is like

4757.52 --> 4762.080000000001
there were not that many articles and

4759.679 --> 4765.8
there were a lot of like puppets

4762.08 --> 4769.84
that were like counter propaganda in it

4765.8 --> 4772.820000000001
say oh they're Liars it's perfectly safe

4769.84 --> 4775.219
there were actual people like in chats

4772.82 --> 4777.739
and [ __ ] doing that back then 15 years

4775.219 --> 4779.6
ago they're not doing it now and now

4777.739 --> 4782.54
when you Google it there's lists and

4779.6 --> 4785.06
lists of just showing how horrific this

4782.54 --> 4786.32
stuff really is what it all does to you

4785.06 --> 4788.54
right

4786.32 --> 4790.34
when you Googled it 15 years ago you

4788.54 --> 4792.679
wouldn't see that

4790.34 --> 4795.56
you wouldn't get those articles you'd

4792.679 --> 4797.9
get [ __ ] articles

4795.56 --> 4801.02
making excuses for it and how it's all

4797.9 --> 4802.28
just conspiracy if there is yeah Jesse

4801.02 --> 4805.76
Ventura

4802.28 --> 4808.099999999999
yeah his conspiracy theory

4805.76 --> 4812.14
uh series that was on the television

4808.1 --> 4812.14
even also addressed aspartame

4812.9 --> 4815.5599999999995
that's right

4826.219 --> 4831.58
but back then 15 years ago it was a

4828.739 --> 4831.58
whole thing

4832.76 --> 4838.34
and I was like really on top of it

4835.4 --> 4841.099999999999
thanks to Alex Jones and Infowars which

4838.34 --> 4844.159000000001
was then to present planet.tv which I

4841.1 --> 4846.7390000000005
had to have a special membership for

4844.159 --> 4849.32
which is very exciting

4846.739 --> 4851.959999999999
very Niche because there weren't that

4849.32 --> 4854.299999999999
many people that even really knew about

4851.96 --> 4857.199
Alex Jones back then

4854.3 --> 4859.64
and I was like I mean on the loop

4857.199 --> 4862.4
I still remember that I went to certain

4859.64 --> 4864.92
like uh

4862.4 --> 4867.92
groom conventions with people that were

4864.92 --> 4870.02
doing research with Chemtrails and with

4867.92 --> 4873.08
the flu vaccine and all that

4870.02 --> 4875.179
and I went with those it was really uh

4873.08 --> 4876.26
interesting time was very awesome to do

4875.179 --> 4878.4800000000005
that

4876.26 --> 4880.76
because they were all like it was like a

4878.48 --> 4882.919999999999
mini think tank so my one of the first

4880.76 --> 4885.1990000000005
think tanks that I've ever been part of

4882.92 --> 4887.2390000000005
and I would always like give out my

4885.199 --> 4890.0
report about what Alex Jones was talking

4887.239 --> 4892.04
about which is really silly in

4890.0 --> 4894.199
retrospect but still he had a lot of

4892.04 --> 4897.8
good info back then

4894.199 --> 4902.62
it was much less adverse tiesman spammy

4897.8 --> 4902.62
much less politicized it was just more

4902.8 --> 4909.14
food and medical information that

4906.08 --> 4912.26
everybody just needs to know

4909.14 --> 4914.360000000001
right and about Chemtrails and all that

4912.26 --> 4917.860000000001
and

4914.36 --> 4917.86
so yeah with good times

4918.14 --> 4923.2390000000005
after a while I mean at first it was

4920.719 --> 4925.699
really terrifying

4923.239 --> 4928.28
and paranoia inducing but then when I

4925.699 --> 4931.159
got used to it yeah I had a lot of good

4928.28 --> 4932.84
moments after that thanks to being part

4931.159 --> 4935.239
of that knowledge

4932.84 --> 4937.58
and spreading it

4935.239 --> 4940.099999999999
I still remember that like if I would go

4937.58 --> 4944.0
to places or festivals I would literally

4940.1 --> 4945.1990000000005
have movies like end game or Terror

4944.0 --> 4947.48
storm

4945.199 --> 4950.9
The Obama Deception

4947.48 --> 4953.239
on DVDs I would literally buy DVDs and

4950.9 --> 4955.339999999999
then just copy it on there and then hand

4953.239 --> 4957.379999999999
those out

4955.34 --> 4960.26
that was also a thing

4957.38 --> 4962.7390000000005
it worked pretty well I handed out a

4960.26 --> 4962.7390000000005
whole bunch

4971.239 --> 4977.12
what the Ruf wants to debate me on the

4975.199 --> 4979.9
housekeeping questions why does he want

4977.12 --> 4979.9
to debate me

4984.44 --> 4989.178999999999
it's just gonna try to guess like me

4986.659 --> 4991.04
about how fpd is gonna get got

4989.179 --> 4994.219
everything wrong and blah blah blah dude

4991.04 --> 4997.9
why would you debate me I mean I'm not a

4994.219 --> 4997.9
math expert or anything

4998.239 --> 5002.08
I know roof is going to be better at

5000.4 --> 5004.96
math than me

5002.08 --> 5008.199
but yeah don't really give a [ __ ]

5004.96 --> 5010.42
I mean why would I debate or why would I

5008.199 --> 5013.178999999999
do that

5010.42 --> 5016.54
I mean sure I'll have a conversation

5013.179 --> 5018.04
with him but I like a debate

5016.54 --> 5020.679
it's not

5018.04 --> 5023.58
you're not really gonna

5020.679 --> 5023.58
accomplish anything

5025.12 --> 5031.48
I mean I'd rather have him

5028.239 --> 5034.48
get well maybe on the Flat Earth debates

5031.48 --> 5036.82
and do it Maybe

5034.48 --> 5039.04
you know what if I if I would be able to

5036.82 --> 5041.32
get some assistance from the guys not

5039.04 --> 5043.0
necessarily from Nathan then I'd debate

5041.32 --> 5045.639999999999
ruhef

5043.0 --> 5048.82
or Nathan's

5045.64 --> 5050.56
right if Nathan actually does the

5048.82 --> 5052.719
moderating and it doesn't do the

5050.56 --> 5055.900000000001
debating himself because you know where

5052.719 --> 5058.6
what will happen then this is maybe that

5055.9 --> 5061.86
but other than that sure I'll have a

5058.6 --> 5061.860000000001
conversation with him

5076.179 --> 5079.4400000000005
okay Clary

5080.679 --> 5083.46
sure

5090.699 --> 5095.379999999999
they wouldn't want Fair moderation how

5092.98 --> 5098.04
do you know Nathan Nathan would be a

5095.38 --> 5098.04
great moderator

5098.08 --> 5105.1
it's just as if Nathan goes up against

5100.659 --> 5110.639999999999
someone himself during the show

5105.1 --> 5110.64
it's gonna is gonna be basically yeah

5112.78 --> 5120.099999999999
you know what happens

5115.42 --> 5122.38
but if he specifically is the moderator

5120.1 --> 5124.780000000001
that would be different he would stay

5122.38 --> 5126.219
out of it he wouldn't get super enraged

5124.78 --> 5128.44
I think

5126.219 --> 5131.02
it would just take it easy and not be

5128.44 --> 5133.299999999999
that invested except for the moderating

5131.02 --> 5134.070000000001

[Music]

5149.86 --> 5153.179
okay Clary

5167.739 --> 5172.36
yeah it's kind of pointless though too

5170.32 --> 5174.88
debunk in coherent dielectric

5172.36 --> 5177.639
acceleration

5174.88 --> 5178.6
why doesn't somebody actually prove it

5177.639 --> 5181.36
first

5178.6 --> 5184.5
I mean it's not there

5181.36 --> 5184.5
it's [ __ ]

5184.96 --> 5190.06
yeah it's an idea that idea suggests

5188.38 --> 5191.56
that through some electrical

5190.06 --> 5195.400000000001
interference

5191.56 --> 5199.42
[Music]

5195.4 --> 5202.78
you could literally reverse

5199.42 --> 5206.5
the yeah the well the density falling

5202.78 --> 5209.08
and right right that's suggested well

5206.5 --> 5211.12
that doesn't happen there's no oh we're

5209.08 --> 5213.04
we're putting it on the tension and oh

5211.12 --> 5215.98
look all the heavy things are falling up

5213.04 --> 5218.5
in the lighter like the mini helium

5215.98 --> 5220.36
balloon is suddenly going down no no

5218.5 --> 5225.36
that doesn't happen it never happens

5220.36 --> 5228.4
it's never happened it will never happen

5225.36 --> 5231.42
incoherent dielectric acceleration is a

5228.4 --> 5231.42
ridiculous myth

5231.46 --> 5235.9800000000005
and not scientifically valid

5237.94 --> 5242.199
so why do you want why would you want to

5240.159 --> 5244.599999999999
debunk it when it's simply not even

5242.199 --> 5247.32
proven

5244.6 --> 5247.320000000001
it's kind of weird

yeah yeah in general guys I'm not super

5490.179 --> 5495.9
enthusiastic to go up against

5492.78 --> 5499.12
anti-flat earthers or ballers

5495.9 --> 5501.638999999999
specifically like in defense of

5499.12 --> 5504.82
the Flat Earth because

5501.639 --> 5507.6990000000005
I know what they do and it like it's not

5504.82 --> 5509.259999999999
really about argumentation

5507.699 --> 5510.4
to them

5509.26 --> 5511.96
right

5510.4 --> 5514.679
I just

5511.96 --> 5514.679
I don't

5515.08 --> 5520.32

here's the link for fiber outsis

5565.179 --> 5568.4400000000005
shop on Etsy

5570.46 --> 5575.38
she embolish debate

5572.5 --> 5576.699
or me debate Ballers and win every time

5575.38 --> 5579.46
yes

5576.699 --> 5581.199
but that's like if I in the moment have

5579.46 --> 5583.659
to go up against somebody especially

5581.199 --> 5586.54
like in chat or something right

5583.659 --> 5588.759999999999
but if I'd be like oh we're going to

5586.54 --> 5591.4
have a debate

5588.76 --> 5593.02
that's different because then my time is

5591.4 --> 5597.759999999999
set

5593.02 --> 5599.92
right and they're gonna like try to get

5597.76 --> 5602.159000000001
to me they're trying to claw their way

5599.92 --> 5602.159
in

5602.26 --> 5606.4800000000005
seeing them do it tried many times

5610.9 --> 5614.739
I think the last time I tried was Mr

5613.06 --> 5617.4400000000005
sensible

5614.739 --> 5619.9
and then he just played stupid honking

5617.44 --> 5621.679999999999
noises over my responses and all that

5619.9 --> 5624.889999999999
was very aggravating

[Music]

5630.9 --> 5635.08
[Music]

5639.28 --> 5646.0599999999995
right my problem is

5642.639 --> 5647.02
is that well I have a ball win inside of

5646.06 --> 5648.88
me

5647.02 --> 5652.0
and

5648.88 --> 5654.34
I just don't want to do it like they do

5652.0 --> 5657.76
yeah I don't want this psychological

5654.34 --> 5661.96
warfare [ __ ] like I feel embarrassed by

5657.76 --> 5664.12
it my ball inside feels embarrassed for

5661.96 --> 5667.0
the behavior of anti-flat earthers and

5664.12 --> 5670.239
that's not actually a joke I do

5667.0 --> 5672.699
I find it embarrassing I don't wanna I

5670.239 --> 5676.0599999999995
don't want them to behave like that it's

5672.699 --> 5677.62
embarrassing to the ball

5676.06 --> 5681.04
for me

5677.62 --> 5683.739
kind of weird right but yeah I am kind

5681.04 --> 5686.44
of weird like that

5683.739 --> 5688.78
I'd much rather have like a friendly

5686.44 --> 5691.48
conversation

5688.78 --> 5694.78
and then I probably try to bring up

5691.48 --> 5697.48
little details like I do like hey how

5694.78 --> 5701.0199999999995
about this zero g thing

5697.48 --> 5705.04
or what is the ozone layer right now

5701.02 --> 5707.4400000000005
that's like ball mechanics that I like

5705.04 --> 5709.6
to dig into and would like to discuss

5707.44 --> 5711.339999999999
with Ballers too is like hey what do you

5709.6 --> 5713.8
actually think about this how did you

5711.34 --> 5714.76
hear about this what did you learn about

5713.8 --> 5717.400000000001
this

5714.76 --> 5719.26
does it make any sense to you

5717.4 --> 5721.42
right

5719.26 --> 5724.84
that's the type of discussion that I

5721.42 --> 5726.58
would well like like maybe even love to

5724.84 --> 5728.9800000000005
have with a baller

5726.58 --> 5731.0199999999995
and that would be pretty interesting I

5728.98 --> 5733.919999999999
think and like it wouldn't have to go

5731.02 --> 5736.360000000001
sour I wouldn't have to go like oh you

5733.92 --> 5738.4
you're not gonna win

5736.36 --> 5739.9
like that [ __ ] you know it's just

5738.4 --> 5741.879999999999
annoying

5739.9 --> 5745.299999999999
like I'm done with that I'm done with

5741.88 --> 5747.639
the bickering it's a waste of my time

5745.3 --> 5750.1
it doesn't actually accomplish anything

5747.639 --> 5751.6
you don't figure things out that way

5750.1 --> 5754.6
it's just

5751.6 --> 5754.6
annoying

5755.48 --> 5758.669999999999
[Music]

5763.9 --> 5770.799999999999
yeah like well said pgs here indeed

5768.52 --> 5774.659000000001
I mean that kind of painting is like the

5770.8 --> 5774.659000000001
real thing and the AI are

5774.88 --> 5780.1
some of it is interesting but it it

5777.159 --> 5782.799999999999
cannot truly match up to the

5780.1 --> 5785.9800000000005
to just this condensed

5782.8 --> 5788.400000000001
human Spirit dedication to a painting

5785.98 --> 5788.4
like that

5797.54 --> 5800.699
[Music]

5824.26 --> 5827.860000000001
foreign

5825.4 --> 5830.5199999999995
yeah fibroids paintings are very

5827.86 --> 5830.5199999999995
interesting looking

5831.54 --> 5834.75
[Music]

5836.739 --> 5841.959999999999
anyway

5839.139 --> 5844.06
so yeah I'm up for conversations but if

5841.96 --> 5846.4
it's going to be a real debate and they

5844.06 --> 5849.1
insist oh we're gonna

5846.4 --> 5851.44
we're I'm not gonna hold back our word

5849.1 --> 5854.52
I'm gonna destroy every single one of

5851.44 --> 5857.44
the housekeeping questions

5854.52 --> 5861.040000000001
I'd had to I would have to just happen

5857.44 --> 5863.5
to be in the mood for that like in in a

5861.04 --> 5865.48
strong sunny day for me to be like okay

5863.5 --> 5871.139
I'll do that now because otherwise it's

5865.48 --> 5871.138999999999
just gonna be oh no ah this again

5871.659 --> 5874.379999999999
you know

5875.739 --> 5881.5599999999995
I don't want to be a complainy pants but

5878.92 --> 5886.3
even like for example

5881.56 --> 5888.639
this one QE history very late so it was

5886.3 --> 5890.679
very late that doesn't help me because I

5888.639 --> 5892.84
was just to die for it but him just like

5890.679 --> 5894.219
I'm printing out every single fallacy

5892.84 --> 5898.179
and like

5894.219 --> 5902.219
okay you're really good at that but

5898.179 --> 5902.219
it's getting kind of tedious

5903.159 --> 5908.98
maybe to some people that's exactly what

5905.86 --> 5910.54
they want to see but for me I'm much

5908.98 --> 5914.0199999999995
more interested in just the

5910.54 --> 5916.659
conversations that nobody thought of

5914.02 --> 5918.400000000001
like hey what is the ozone layer how can

5916.659 --> 5922.48
it be there

5918.4 --> 5924.04
right I mean whoever talks about that

5922.48 --> 5926.259999999999
I do

5924.04 --> 5928.84
that's the type of stuff that I like to

5926.26 --> 5931.3
discuss mechanical things that are kind

5928.84 --> 5933.9400000000005
of like put in a corner nobody really

5931.3 --> 5936.78
thinks about it but it's actually kind

5933.94 --> 5936.78
of interesting too

5938.739 --> 5941.218999999999
anyway

5947.98 --> 5954.0599999999995
am I gonna be the life of the party on

5949.96 --> 5954.06
fvd today I don't know

5954.28 --> 5956.82
Maybe

5957.4 --> 5962.259999999999
I mean don't forget yesterday I had a

5960.34 --> 5963.639
lot of energy because the day before I

5962.26 --> 5965.02
had basically

5963.639 --> 5968.58
a day off

5965.02 --> 5968.580000000001
because I was a bit sickish

5968.739 --> 5976.919999999999
I don't know if I'm gonna be that

5971.139 --> 5976.92
energetic but I do feel good I feel fine

5981.04 --> 5984.6
and the weather is kind of nice

5985.96 --> 5991.38
I mean

5987.76 --> 5991.38
yesterday was a lot worse

6018.4 --> 6021.87
[Music]

6026.84 --> 6034.4400000000005
newspaper cartoonist switch to iPad

6030.139 --> 6038.3
drawings artwork artwork degenerates

6034.44 --> 6038.299999999999
yeah oh for simplifies

6038.46 --> 6040.88
right

6051.3 --> 6056.4800000000005
I mean

6052.739 --> 6060.239
part of the interesting things about

6056.48 --> 6062.699
like drawing is that you actually do it

6060.239 --> 6067.04
with your hand on the paper and that

6062.699 --> 6067.04
little unexpected things also can happen

6067.199 --> 6072.599999999999
like something that might have been a

6069.12 --> 6074.94
mistake on first go might certainly be

6072.6 --> 6076.92
realized as like hey wait

6074.94 --> 6079.259999999999
that looks actually kind of interesting

6076.92 --> 6082.02
what if I actually just keep it like

6079.26 --> 6084.780000000001
that on purpose right well that sort of

6082.02 --> 6087.42
thing isn't really gonna happen as often

6084.78 --> 6089.219
if you're gonna do did you do painting

6087.42 --> 6093.06
you know

6089.219 --> 6096.119
because it just doesn't work the same

6093.06 --> 6100.38
I don't really like digital painting

6096.119 --> 6104.159
I like sketching with a stupid Gray

6100.38 --> 6105.96
a pencil on a piece of paper and then if

6104.159 --> 6108.54
it's like oh I could do something with

6105.96 --> 6111.4800000000005
this well then I'll scan it in my

6108.54 --> 6113.699
scanner and then work on it with

6111.48 --> 6116.58
Photoshop

6113.699 --> 6118.799999999999
but I always like to turn or to start

6116.58 --> 6121.679
out with it with an actual pencil

6118.8 --> 6125.58
especially if there's just gonna be like

6121.679 --> 6129.4800000000005
shapes or like oh I have to conjure up

6125.58 --> 6131.88
a map of a fantasy land or something

6129.48 --> 6134.04
right like I always start with the

6131.88 --> 6137.159000000001
pencil it's just like let's see what

6134.04 --> 6138.3
happens and just like oh what is this

6137.159 --> 6141.119
becoming

6138.3 --> 6142.860000000001
I have to do that with a pencil it

6141.119 --> 6145.099999999999
doesn't work on the computer it just

6142.86 --> 6145.099999999999
doesn't

6145.32 --> 6150.5
have to do it with hand

6147.179 --> 6150.5
like in front of my face

6150.98 --> 6156.419999999999
otherwise it just that doesn't happen

6153.3 --> 6158.9400000000005
that magic of conjuring something out of

6156.42 --> 6161.119
nothing it doesn't happen otherwise with

6158.94 --> 6161.119
me

6161.159 --> 6165.92
so yeah

6162.84 --> 6168.42
a lot of creative new things do come out

6165.92 --> 6173.2390000000005
specifically sketching

6168.42 --> 6173.2390000000005
for me on paper with a stupid pencil

6178.8 --> 6183.78
um right and that's how I how I've made

6181.739 --> 6187.28
a lot of things by the way

6183.78 --> 6187.28
oh it maps and such

6189.42 --> 6195.3
so I got all these

6192.38 --> 6196.6
[Music]

6195.3 --> 6199.759
foreign

6196.6 --> 6199.759
[Music]

6210.84 --> 6220.1990000000005
yeah I mean this is

6214.44 --> 6223.5
a pencil sketch scanned worked on

6220.199 --> 6225.739
and then print it out and worked on

6223.5 --> 6225.739
again

6226.04 --> 6229.3
but that's how I do it a lot of the

6228.659 --> 6231.9
times

6229.3 --> 6234.38
[Music]

6231.9 --> 6234.379999999999
right

6235.38 --> 6238.400000000001
it's just yeah

6238.56 --> 6241.580000000001
that's a map

6244.02 --> 6247.619000000001
see

6245.78 --> 6252.08
[Music]

6247.619 --> 6255.239
oh this so I made this one too

6252.08 --> 6256.739
yeah the plastic is reflecting a little

6255.239 --> 6259.98
too much

6256.739 --> 6262.159
so yeah this is not helping to get it

6259.98 --> 6262.159
out

6265.219 --> 6269.06
oh look at that

6269.159 --> 6274.619
right here's another example so here's

6271.5 --> 6277.8
like an original pencil sketch

6274.619 --> 6279.659
and then here is a little zoom in the

6277.8 --> 6284.360000000001
same region

6279.659 --> 6284.36
with some digitally added stuff

6285.96 --> 6292.02
yeah so it's like the length all the

6290.58 --> 6294.38
buildings

6292.02 --> 6297.659000000001
and then some text

6294.38 --> 6302.639
pointers to tell you what it is

6297.659 --> 6305.879999999999
right this is hand sketched like I want

6302.639 --> 6308.34
it to be drawn by hand on a piece of

6305.88 --> 6309.25
paper and then I'll scan it and digitize

6308.34 --> 6310.92
it

6309.25 --> 6314.01
[Music]

6310.92 --> 6319.58
and that just works the best

6314.01 --> 6319.58
[Music]

6325.92 --> 6331.679
for me

6328.82 --> 6335.42
[Music]

6331.679 --> 6335.42
okay picture of this

6347.88 --> 6352.400000000001
oh I almost forgot about this one

6353.34 --> 6357.179
wow

6354.78 --> 6359.88
holy [ __ ] I had much of this stuff

6357.179 --> 6361.67
someone forgot about all that

6359.88 --> 6364.8
damn

6361.67 --> 6364.8
[Applause]

6365.239 --> 6368.599999999999
look at that

6369.119 --> 6373.199
this is pretty Advanced yeah this is

6371.1 --> 6375.3
like at the last stages of my campaign

6373.199 --> 6380.178999999999
and after this point yeah the gamers

6375.3 --> 6380.179
broke off but see look at that

6380.34 --> 6384.08
this is an entire continent

6390.48 --> 6392.78
foreign

6394.82 --> 6403.5199999999995
and this is the racial division

6400.26 --> 6403.52
of the peoples

6404.4 --> 6409.98
yeah so it's like a demographic map of

6407.699 --> 6412.699
the different types of peoples where

6409.98 --> 6412.699
they are

6413.159 --> 6417.32
and here's to zoom in on one city

6417.8 --> 6421.9800000000005
gelton's runt

6420.06 --> 6424.320000000001
which one is that

6421.98 --> 6427.799999999999
it's number three yeah this is like one

6424.32 --> 6430.94
of the biggest cities over here

6427.8 --> 6430.9400000000005
at my finger

6431.119 --> 6438.32
see that little circle over there

6435.0 --> 6438.32
so that's this

6447.36 --> 6453.78
yeah Big Harbor

6450.3 --> 6455.52
multiple layer Castle wool

6453.78 --> 6458.179
I haven't actually

6455.52 --> 6458.179
finished

6458.48 --> 6464.04
installing all the buildings yet so this

6460.98 --> 6466.44
is actually a slightly unfinished map

6464.04 --> 6470.0
but yeah I was in the middle of that and

6466.44 --> 6473.58
then my Gamers kind of quit on me

6470.0 --> 6476.52
oh and here's another Park

6473.58 --> 6478.139
this is oh wow this is really awesome

6476.52 --> 6480.360000000001
looking through this I haven't seen this

6478.139 --> 6483.92
in a long ass time

6480.36 --> 6483.92
it's just like the

6489.3 --> 6494.1
yeah this is the little purple Corner

6492.0 --> 6497.46
thingy here this is like a very very

6494.1 --> 6499.9800000000005
super special Mage Tower of Mage

6497.46 --> 6502.8
isolates that keep completely to

6499.98 --> 6506.9
themselves you could call them you could

6502.8 --> 6506.900000000001
roughly compare them with Jews

6507.179 --> 6513.96
and that's this place

6510.239 --> 6516.0599999999995
like a giant Wizard Tower Temple on the

6513.96 --> 6518.58
edge of a mountain reach

6516.06 --> 6520.76
and it's like really hard to even get

6518.58 --> 6520.76
there

6522.78 --> 6526.639
see so this thing is like

6526.739 --> 6532.5
this little purple tip there

6530.46 --> 6534.659
an entire thing what you just saw see

6532.5 --> 6536.94
and it's it's basically right next to

6534.659 --> 6538.379999999999
the well this is like one of the biggest

6536.94 --> 6541.379999999999
capitals

6538.38 --> 6545.46
is right next to it

6541.38 --> 6548.159000000001
see and this all all of this flowed out

6545.46 --> 6549.84
of this just this

6548.159 --> 6551.879999999999
just drew it

6549.84 --> 6554.159000000001
a bunch of circles like oh here's a city

6551.88 --> 6556.02
here's a city oh this is what roughly

6554.159 --> 6560.46
would happen this this kind of industry

6556.02 --> 6562.139
and then it's like let's zoom in

6560.46 --> 6565.639
and certainly

6562.139 --> 6565.639
It all becomes this

6565.86 --> 6569.159
looks like a real medieval city thank

6568.08 --> 6572.5199999999995
you

6569.159 --> 6576.179
thank you very much I feel very honored

6572.52 --> 6579.030000000001
that you would recognize that

6576.179 --> 6580.56
I did my best

6579.03 --> 6583.199
[Music]

6580.56 --> 6586.02
ah that was really cool looking at that

6583.199 --> 6589.138999999999
again I have no idea why it's not on the

6586.02 --> 6591.860000000001
front page it should be

6589.139 --> 6591.86
looking awesome

6600.02 --> 6604.639
hufflinks don't matter as much

6604.739 --> 6606.919999999999
foreign

6610.16 --> 6616.76
[Music]

6617.1 --> 6620.9400000000005
I guess I don't have the map of Atlanta

6619.08 --> 6621.91
door then

6620.94 --> 6625.86
all right

6621.91 --> 6626.94
[Music]

6625.86 --> 6630.179
yeah

6626.94 --> 6632.36
oh wow I completely forgot about the

6630.179 --> 6632.36
time

6638.46 --> 6643.5
I'm gonna round out the show

6640.92 --> 6646.02
I just yeah I was looking through that

6643.5 --> 6650.06
and it got really enthralled I mean I

6646.02 --> 6650.06
had forgotten I I made all that

6651.9 --> 6656.699
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

6654.96 --> 6658.92
you liked this show I thought it was

6656.699 --> 6661.5599999999995
interesting

6658.92 --> 6663.659
informative and a little weird Mandela

6661.56 --> 6666.360000000001
effect

6663.659 --> 6668.699
on my part about the aspartame I

6666.36 --> 6671.4
actually thought it was deployed as an

6668.699 --> 6675.9
official chemical warfare weapon

6671.4 --> 6678.98
but I guess that didn't actually happen

6675.9 --> 6678.98
really weird

6680.28 --> 6684.48
it's only been used as a regular

6682.56 --> 6686.76
consumption

6684.48 --> 6688.799999999999
chemical warfare

6686.76 --> 6691.08
right anyway

6688.8 --> 6693.2390000000005
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6691.08 --> 6695.5199999999995
like this show if you did then please
