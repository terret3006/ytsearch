36.58 --> 43.61
good morning welcome to flatter the

40.61 --> 45.35
earlybird number 436 I'm your host

43.61 --> 47.06
Arwen and before I start to show please

45.35 --> 48.95
don't forget to share it on any platform

50.66 --> 54.349999999999994
bell notification so you know when I'm

52.309 --> 56.0
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

54.35 --> 58.46
Amsterdam time every day

56.0 --> 60.769999999999996
please also do support me through the

58.46 --> 65.68
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and super

60.77 --> 68.09
chats that would be much appreciated so

65.68 --> 75.22900000000001
wait I don't know why but my volume is

68.09 --> 78.53
off again so odd so I'm putting it back

75.229 --> 83.72
to 16 I don't know why it keeps on

78.53 --> 87.05
shifting so odd I'm speaking twice as

83.72 --> 89.53999999999999
loud now and closer by yesterday and now

87.05 --> 93.11
with 16 days ago it's only back to

89.54 --> 95.81
normal levels it's I don't get it don't

93.11 --> 104.71
gets what go what's going on with my

95.81 --> 108.94
volume err it's weird let me

104.71 --> 112.11
keep trying to fix that call them just

108.94 --> 112.11
don't know why it does that

114.06 --> 122.82000000000001
okay 1818 s this better okay

118.89 --> 126.88
right so anyway mmm the weather today is

122.82 --> 128.95
yeah it's okay I think there's some

126.88 --> 132.82
chemtrails no no no hey I see you moon

128.95 --> 137.23
over there I just spotted it it's right

132.82 --> 142.84
over there behind be having the gray

137.23 --> 145.14999999999998
soup anyway it is extremely windy and I

142.84 --> 148.48
think thought it was quite annoying when

145.15 --> 150.19
it was out for groceries and the way

148.48 --> 152.85999999999999
back here cuz I had to push her a wind

150.19 --> 156.60999999999999
but yeah at least it's not raining it's

152.86 --> 166.36
not very wet it's a bit sunny here and

156.61 --> 168.02
there so yeah so today I have with me

166.36 --> 169.47000000000003
green tea that's it

168.02 --> 173.76000000000002
[Music]

169.47 --> 173.76
let's see I wasn't yet

176.31 --> 184.859
for a niche was first Amanda you seeking

181.269 --> 188.65
star water they lie Ohio good servant

184.859 --> 195.90900000000002
michael roark Anna koala

188.65 --> 198.689
Gideon sick YouTube mm-hmm flattered

195.909 --> 201.42999999999998
spaceman yeah good to see you all

198.689 --> 202.03
Saturday so we can do probably a long

201.43 --> 209.95000000000002
shower today

202.03 --> 212.879
oh hello yogurt flying also even though

209.95 --> 218.67999999999998
yeah and I'm not in the best of moods

212.879 --> 222.0
since yesterday blatantly obvious why I

218.68 --> 222.0
think for a lot of people

225.85 --> 230.57
at this point I basically feel like kind

228.56 --> 233.54
of stepping out of this whole situation

230.57 --> 240.53
and just do something else because I'm

233.54 --> 243.07
running so much as a dead end now that

240.53 --> 243.07
yeah

243.73 --> 251.06
well because there's there's just no

247.52 --> 254.39000000000001
progression that I can I can't continue

251.06 --> 263.15
with my figuring out this whole light

254.39 --> 267.53
situation I can't do it like there's

263.15 --> 269.38899999999995
just this freaking politicized situation

267.53 --> 273.40999999999997
going on concerning the nature of light

269.389 --> 279.05
and there's just nobody's nobody can do

273.41 --> 282.16900000000004
it nobody everybody is on either the

279.05 --> 284.39
freakin wave and then assert the ether

282.169 --> 288.40999999999997
and fantasize on about that for two

284.39 --> 290.63
hours as what happened after Randi did

288.41 --> 292.79
this after show in the presentation and

290.63 --> 294.68
we talked a little about it yeah and

292.79 --> 298.58000000000004
after that everybody came in started

294.68 --> 300.35
asserting their conceptualizations in

298.58 --> 302.03
the backdrop history and it's all very

300.35 --> 305.75
fascinating and then proceeded to

302.03 --> 308.75
fantasize on into oblivion about the

305.75 --> 311.0
freakin ether and so many misconceptions

308.75 --> 315.28
through them I couldn't be even bear to

311.0 --> 320.09
sit through that anymore so it's useless

315.28 --> 322.25
yeah John's not helping Nathan's not

320.09 --> 325.4
helping they're all stuck on this

322.25 --> 328.19
particle and the waivers are stuck on

325.4 --> 331.669
the wave and I I can't get anything

328.19 --> 334.91
through it's like when I say hey hello

331.669 --> 337.34
people hello maybe light is not a

334.91 --> 344.93
particle nor a wave could there be a

337.34 --> 349.84
third option nobody even says hmm well

344.93 --> 353.51
maybe no I'm literally hearing no

349.84 --> 355.669
response zero everybody's freaking

353.51 --> 359.87
obsessed with this [ __ ] particle and

355.669 --> 362.63
this [ __ ] wave I'm sick of it there's

359.87 --> 365.45
no progress here and there's not gonna

362.63 --> 367.52
be any progress like this if it's just

365.45 --> 370.729
going to be the freakin fantasising and

367.52 --> 372.919
the gatekeeping I'm stuck between

370.729 --> 375.88
fantasies and a gatekeeper and there's

372.919 --> 375.88
nowhere left to go

402.039 --> 409.36
so yeah Who am I gonna do this who am I

405.669 --> 413.49899999999997
even gonna speculate with if the only

409.36 --> 416.529
people that can even entertain what I

413.499 --> 419.46900000000005
say are basically trying to follow in my

416.529 --> 421.629
steps it's looking for me to give them

419.469 --> 423.669
the answers well I'm still researching

421.629 --> 426.399
it I need somebody that has more

423.669 --> 428.289
understanding than me about it I need

426.399 --> 431.77
somebody to step away from this

428.289 --> 435.12
disgusting politicized situation in this

431.77 --> 439.33
whole ordeal I need someone to step away

435.12 --> 444.279
from the politicization and actually

439.33 --> 450.419
work with me on this and stop stop all

444.279 --> 453.729
this useless bickering and this this

450.419 --> 456.52
just having the mind made up about what

453.729 --> 459.969
its gonna be and and using that as an

456.52 --> 461.919
entire baseline of argumentation I'm so

459.969 --> 464.159
sick of it I can't handle this [ __ ]

461.919 --> 464.159
anymore

468.77 --> 471.89
[Music]

480.35 --> 483.559
[Music]

489.72 --> 498.04
yeah well Effie you know Flat Earth it's

494.89 --> 501.72999999999996
all about revealing the nature of the

498.04 --> 505.69
realm and the light is a very intricate

501.73 --> 510.09000000000003
important part for us to understand what

505.69 --> 510.09
the hell is going on here and

510.54 --> 517.6800000000001
everybody's just stuck on the mechanics

513.66 --> 519.8199999999999
all the garbage of the presuppositional

517.68 --> 523.05
mathematical garbage that's been

519.82 --> 525.58
produced over the last 80 years and

523.05 --> 529.56
probably the entirety of quantum

525.58 --> 534.6700000000001
mechanics you know this is basically it

529.56 --> 537.2199999999999
if if this entire supposed buckyball

534.67 --> 538.93
situation with this supposed diffraction

537.22 --> 540.6700000000001
pattern and I took a quick glance and

538.93 --> 542.02
what Randy showed mech I haven't really

540.67 --> 544.36
read through the thing yet but just a

542.02 --> 546.31
quick glance at the graphs I couldn't

544.36 --> 549.22
you could see what was gonna what was

546.31 --> 550.9899999999999
supposed to be the pattern right well

549.22 --> 553.75
guess what it wasn't a diffraction

550.99 --> 557.71
pattern it was nothing like it it was

553.75 --> 561.0
something else yeah well with that the

557.71 --> 564.58
entire premise of quantum mechanics

561.0 --> 566.76
completely is destroyed it is nothing

564.58 --> 569.97
but presupposition now

566.76 --> 569.97
pretty much

570.62 --> 579.38
it's useless I was kind of holding on to

575.9 --> 582.8
the freaking buckyballs you know it was

579.38 --> 586.73
the last option to to give it any kind

582.8 --> 589.66
of sensible purpose but it's not there

586.73 --> 592.3100000000001
it's not real it's not sufficient

589.66 --> 593.54
doesn't show the actual wave function

592.31 --> 598.18
that you can compare to the wave

593.54 --> 602.66
function that comes out of light so yeah

598.18 --> 606.76
that's that very disappointing turns out

602.66 --> 609.98
that there's almost nowhere left to go

606.76 --> 611.51
it's like everything we've learned

609.98 --> 615.08
everything that's been done in the last

611.51 --> 619.51
hundred years or so is all filler is all

615.08 --> 619.51
filler to distract us almost all of it

624.079 --> 628.79
just I don't know and I'm taking it a

626.48 --> 631.939
little bit more pessimistic than usual

628.79 --> 636.6189999999999
it's just that kind of sick of the

631.939 --> 638.48
situation I just want to figure it out

636.619 --> 641.239
it don't want to bicker with people and

638.48 --> 644.929
their politicization arguments so sick

641.239 --> 648.97
of it so sick of appeals to things and

644.929 --> 648.97
have-nots having to do with the argument

656.29 --> 659.29
well

663.47 --> 670.3100000000001
why would QE want to budge on his slit

667.19 --> 674.0600000000001
experiment in the photons you know the

670.31 --> 676.6099999999999
photon concepts they kind of work they

674.06 --> 680.5999999999999
work better than a freaking wave concept

676.61 --> 685.13
it's just not completely correct the the

680.6 --> 688.94
literal particle assumption is is a bit

685.13 --> 692.36
too far but as I said you can definitely

688.94 --> 695.96
think of light as a particle it's just

692.36 --> 699.11
not but hey we don't understand what the

695.96 --> 703.4000000000001
Freak it is in a particle it's like the

699.11 --> 707.3000000000001
closest thing we can to compare it to

703.4 --> 712.03
something else in order to understand at

707.3 --> 716.06
least the range of its properties right

712.03 --> 718.88
it's not though it doesn't really matter

716.06 --> 721.0999999999999
because doesn't have to be a particle in

718.88 --> 724.34
order for the effects to occur as they

721.1 --> 730.5500000000001
do because the effects occur as they do

724.34 --> 733.07
because they do they just do doesn't say

730.55 --> 735.74
anything about the nature of light

733.07 --> 737.48
really other than it rather says

735.74 --> 739.96
something about the effect of

737.48 --> 739.96
diffraction

753.05 --> 756.05
what

790.28 --> 794.5
I said it Cosentino

801.73 --> 804.97
[Music]

828.99 --> 836.9
all right oh sorry that Cosentino it's

833.7 --> 842.46
very simple at this point

836.9 --> 847.0799999999999
Kiwi keeps this up this is this this

842.46 --> 849.96
attitude growing worse in this affective

847.08 --> 852.84
gatekeeping not saying that's what he's

849.96 --> 856.74
set out to do but it is effectively what

852.84 --> 859.08
he is doing by what he does then yeah I

856.74 --> 861.33
don't see him hanging around for too

859.08 --> 863.99
long he's just gonna go away from

861.33 --> 867.6
YouTube go like oh screw you all nobody

863.99 --> 869.4300000000001
here understands me and everybody's just

867.6 --> 871.0500000000001
being a [ __ ] and going out of control

869.43 --> 874.53
there's nothing more I can do with this

871.05 --> 877.05
I'm gonna go away and literally not be

874.53 --> 878.49
contact ago anymore and hey he can

877.05 --> 880.4699999999999
because nobody knows what he looks like

878.49 --> 882.27
I think that's gonna happen and I think

880.47 --> 884.64
that even Nathan sees it coming

882.27 --> 886.92
and that's might have been part of the

884.64 --> 890.4
motivation why he's so freaking

886.92 --> 893.88
desperate because he placed a lot of

890.4 --> 896.85
this bets as you were due to bets on

893.88 --> 903.12
Kiwi and all that and it's just not

896.85 --> 906.51
working out it's growing worse and I

903.12 --> 911.12
think that that is partially why he just

906.51 --> 914.42
had this disgusting display yesterday

911.12 --> 914.42
it's just

914.83 --> 922.99
the worst one of the worst rants I've

917.11 --> 925.0600000000001
ever heard him do like I don't really

922.99 --> 926.95
feel even like talking to him anymore at

925.06 --> 929.4699999999999
this point it's just so disgusting what

926.95 --> 933.69
he did and you didn't need to do that

929.47 --> 933.69
was completely unnecessary

952.15 --> 957.31
alright what's that it's a custody I

954.279 --> 959.08
don't even know if it was life could be

957.31 --> 962.8199999999999
that it was just the after show

959.08 --> 965.23
but I know it lasted for an hour Randy

962.82 --> 970.0600000000001
was on about it yesterday

965.23 --> 974.7
late and I was part of that show so yeah

970.06 --> 974.6999999999999
that's where we really responded to it

1001.02 --> 1003.59
what

1011.74 --> 1023.83
a handler of what flatter spaceman could

1017.11 --> 1027.99
he be a I don't know a progress delaying

1023.83 --> 1031.06
plant well effectively a gatekeeper to

1027.99 --> 1033.79
prevent progress to keep people fixated

1031.06 --> 1036.339
on certain aspects in order to prevent

1033.79 --> 1038.83
moving beyond that could be possible

1036.339 --> 1040.2
I've even suspected that really early on

1038.83 --> 1044.04
just because of his general attitude

1040.2 --> 1044.04
people who test him

1044.07 --> 1050.56
like in his mind he decides how the

1047.589 --> 1053.77
truth works and when you don't follow

1050.56 --> 1056.5
that pattern then he just says no and

1053.77 --> 1063.28
you're wrong and doesn't exactly show

1056.5 --> 1066.46
you why that's just arrogant so he's not

1063.28 --> 1068.47
a really effective teacher at that you

1066.46 --> 1071.53
know he has all the materials you a

1068.47 --> 1074.8
routine he gives you a class and things

1071.53 --> 1076.84
you can learn and that works right but

1074.8 --> 1084.6399999999999
it's all based on a certain angle of

1076.84 --> 1087.49
approach and it's inflexible so it yeah

1084.64 --> 1090.01
it helps somewhat I understand that side

1087.49 --> 1091.96
but it's just as effective as being

1090.01 --> 1093.97
exposed to Globus telling their

1091.96 --> 1097.66
assertions constantly yeah it's all

1093.97 --> 1099.15
nonsense yeah even if you start out

1097.66 --> 1102.76
knowing that it's all nonsense

1099.15 --> 1106.1200000000001
eventually it'll help having sit through

1102.76 --> 1109.6299999999999
that because now I understand what it is

1106.12 --> 1111.85
and what people think how it works what

1109.63 --> 1115.0
the train of thought behind it is and

1111.85 --> 1119.649
the same goes for everything we have for

1115.0 --> 1122.119
everything John has taught us

1119.649 --> 1127.629
but there's just clearly points where

1122.119 --> 1127.629
it's just not working it's just not

1136.89 --> 1146.8500000000001
I don't accept FBI eats whatever man I

1141.2 --> 1150.24
don't care if he's gonna betray us that

1146.85 --> 1153.6589999999999
it's he is just gonna be a nasty [ __ ]

1150.24 --> 1157.32
piece of [ __ ] that literally will be on

1153.659 --> 1159.48
the level of people like Jim Payne and

1157.32 --> 1160.6689999999999
[ __ ] so it's up to him you know hey if

1159.48 --> 1165.929
he's ok with that

1160.669 --> 1168.419
if he's ok with just being among a blind

1165.929 --> 1170.13
sheet role demons being categorized

1168.419 --> 1174.7990000000002
among those the rest of his life that's

1170.13 --> 1174.7990000000002
up to him I wouldn't recommend it though

1174.919 --> 1180.1390000000001
so yeah it could definitely be faked so

1180.52 --> 1184.059
[Music]

1186.17 --> 1191.03
[Music]

1194.26 --> 1202.27
yeah that's very nice YouTube maybe

1199.02 --> 1204.54
should keep that dream to yourself be

1202.27 --> 1204.54
nice

1208.11 --> 1211.3
[Music]

1237.78 --> 1240.59
hmm

1245.809 --> 1254.989
really YouTube on that case you might

1249.289 --> 1258.4089999999999
want to take a look at your prostate go

1254.989 --> 1269.33
to something to do with it sounds weird

1258.409 --> 1271.94
but it's good well does Studio 68 I

1269.33 --> 1273.9789999999998
don't know you know the next flat

1271.94 --> 1278.3300000000002
earther Bates is gonna be Monday that's

1273.979 --> 1280.519
two days from now I don't know if it

1278.33 --> 1282.109
were on today I wouldn't go there if

1280.519 --> 1286.789
there's ball busters I'm not gonna go

1282.109 --> 1289.849
there just I can't can't do it I don't

1286.789 --> 1294.349
want to do it I don't wanna be part of

1289.849 --> 1297.649
that anymore you know it's really cool

1294.349 --> 1300.559
trailer and all but I don't I don't want

1297.649 --> 1302.869
to be shown in a way where I am

1300.559 --> 1308.539
basically an underling of QE anymore

1302.869 --> 1310.9399999999998
he's not worth it it's just not I don't

1308.539 --> 1313.219
want it so they can't remove me as far

1310.94 --> 1320.6290000000001
as I'm concerned I literally yeah it's

1313.219 --> 1323.6290000000001
just no nothing I can do all that on my

1320.629 --> 1327.4689999999998
own show in my own pace with my own

1323.629 --> 1333.4689999999998
audience and do it much better and much

1327.469 --> 1335.21
less height and not subject my audience

1333.469 --> 1338.719
as much to all this peer pressure

1335.21 --> 1341.509
nonsense which it is in fact it is

1338.719 --> 1344.179
effectively they're constantly with John

1341.509 --> 1347.059
it is doesn't have to be constantly

1344.179 --> 1351.549
mentioned by name or anything but it

1347.059 --> 1351.549
happens constantly so

1354.85 --> 1362.4399999999998
yeah the Meakin yesterday's gone off I

1358.389 --> 1362.4399999999998
was surprised you were in there

1374.24 --> 1382.76
don't be led to what now there's nothing

1378.05 --> 1384.98
to do with Chad Chad is just goofing

1382.76 --> 1392.51
around but they most of them have seen

1384.98 --> 1398.66
it it seemed part of it right well

1392.51 --> 1402.61
you're in for a big a big [ __ ] fest then

1398.66 --> 1402.6100000000001
the enemy can because it was terrible

1405.04 --> 1411.73
there was a shameful display very bad

1459.37 --> 1463.7489999999998
I don't even know what that means Gideon

1461.499 --> 1466.679
SiC Clichy

1463.749 --> 1466.679
what what is that

1476.1 --> 1481.6799999999998
yeah yeah well that's really nice that

1478.65 --> 1485.1000000000001
studio and because he's done so much for

1481.68 --> 1489.99
our shows that means he can just be

1485.1 --> 1493.83
two-faced and assert all kinds of shame

1489.99 --> 1496.98
tactics based on a nonsensical premise

1493.83 --> 1500.4299999999998
that we constantly have to fight when we

1496.98 --> 1503.19
deal with the ballers and then we all

1500.43 --> 1506.0900000000001
including him complain about them doing

1503.19 --> 1509.1000000000001
that and now he's defending that

1506.09 --> 1511.8
approach that the ballers have for

1509.1 --> 1512.49
himself like how dare you be so freakin

1511.8 --> 1515.9099999999999
lazy

1512.49 --> 1518.1
how are you so lazy that you won't get

1515.91 --> 1520.8300000000002
the evidence for the claim that other

1518.1 --> 1522.7199999999998
guy made their claim

1520.83 --> 1527.34
why don't you provide the evidence for

1522.72 --> 1528.99
their claim it is it's the worst I can't

1527.34 --> 1531.72
believe my ears I can't believe he

1528.99 --> 1533.73
actually allowed himself to say that and

1531.72 --> 1540.3
then expand upon it for like half an

1533.73 --> 1542.79
hour it's so disgusting you know then

1540.3 --> 1547.1699999999998
practically the I was basically been

1542.79 --> 1549.51
spending four months defending Huey's

1547.17 --> 1554.01
position against all this [ __ ] light

1549.51 --> 1557.19
waving [ __ ] and he's just leaving me to

1554.01 --> 1560.37
rot and then Nathan even kind of shoves

1557.19 --> 1565.29
in my shoe like how dare you bring QE

1560.37 --> 1568.1399999999999
into it into the argument it's not about

1565.29 --> 1572.94
him originally making the claim about

1568.14 --> 1575.5800000000002
buckyballs now it's about you not using

1572.94 --> 1578.5800000000002
the right arguments and actually drawing

1575.58 --> 1580.26
the buckyballs into it that that was

1578.58 --> 1582.8899999999999
Nathan's approach it's the most

1580.26 --> 1585.93
ridiculous thing I've ever heard

1582.89 --> 1589.6200000000001
what are the worst gaslighting things

1585.93 --> 1592.14
I've ever seen him say and Nathan's done

1589.62 --> 1594.4399999999998
some pretty nasty [ __ ] like in the in

1592.14 --> 1596.8500000000001
the beginning in the far past and then

1594.44 --> 1598.65
excused for that it's new coming and all

1596.85 --> 1601.1399999999999
that everybody was going crazy back then

1598.65 --> 1602.76
but it's like last time he's done

1601.14 --> 1605.2800000000002
anything like it's like three years ago

1602.76 --> 1607.519
and he's changed a lot since I can't

1605.28 --> 1611.19
believe he went there

1607.519 --> 1615.24
it's bad very bad

1611.19 --> 1617.8500000000001
it's Antonio su Bharat's level bad that

1615.24 --> 1619.769
level of deception it's disgusting it's

1617.85 --> 1622.1999999999998
unnecessary I'm not saying that he is

1619.769 --> 1625.47
like that it's just such a bad thing to

1622.2 --> 1627.269
do and such a betrayal betrayal of their

1625.47 --> 1628.769
own principles and betrayal off their

1627.269 --> 1647.82
friends at the same time it's just

1628.769 --> 1649.559
disgusting I don't even know what that

1647.82 --> 1652.1589999999999
is have tapi and I'm not going on

1649.559 --> 1652.1589999999999
discard

1680.66 --> 1684.22
I'm not on this card

1703.559 --> 1712.31
yeah

1705.45 --> 1719.01
that's interesting Amanda young I've had

1712.31 --> 1723.99
globe lied to her visions like pretty

1719.01 --> 1725.8799999999999
extensive ones the ones that I remember

1723.99 --> 1731.66
a lot more than a lot of other things

1725.88 --> 1731.66
and the weird thing is that a lot of it

1731.72 --> 1739.38
was I guess something that could have

1735.54 --> 1741.6599999999999
happened but it never did it is very

1739.38 --> 1744.96
weird so I had experiences like being

1741.66 --> 1748.92
part of it that were quite detailed it

1744.96 --> 1751.47
just never happened but it was like

1748.92 --> 1753.6000000000001
basically a holographic experience and

1751.47 --> 1761.52
it did have interest I remember having

1753.6 --> 1765.57
elaborate conversations with Roxanne for

1761.52 --> 1768.6
example and yeah beyond the

1765.57 --> 1772.9399999999998
conversations we had at the Amsterdam

1768.6 --> 1775.8899999999999
conference which weren't a lot couple

1772.94 --> 1777.78
not super deep and everything but I

1775.89 --> 1780.39
remember having more conversations

1777.78 --> 1782.7
beyond that that literally never really

1780.39 --> 1784.64
happened maybe they will in the future I

1782.7 --> 1790.04
don't know it's always weird with that

1784.64 --> 1790.0400000000002
but yeah

1808.52 --> 1815.66
yeah well duh studio I understand the

1811.01 --> 1817.8799999999999
premise problem is is that Randy got the

1815.66 --> 1820.22
actual article of the officially

1817.88 --> 1824.3300000000002
published article from 1990 he found it

1820.22 --> 1826.58
and there a supposed wave pattern is on

1824.33 --> 1828.02
it where there was the result of the

1826.58 --> 1829.97
buckyballs well guess what it doesn't

1828.02 --> 1835.73
really show the diffraction pattern it

1829.97 --> 1838.69
does it shows a different pattern it's

1835.73 --> 1838.69
not the same pattern

1849.98 --> 1853.17
[Music]

1864.82 --> 1872.47
yeah Nick is always trolling I had the

1870.1 --> 1875.07
trolls will have some feet on this for a

1872.47 --> 1875.07
long time

1875.76 --> 1886.9
Nathan doesn't care about that anyway he

1879.49 --> 1893.28
doesn't care yeah that sounds like fun

1886.9 --> 1893.2800000000002
Amanda young that would be kind of cool

1894.3 --> 1903.8799999999999
I'd love to go out with you guys I have

1901.84 --> 1906.9099999999999
so much music I'd love to share with you

1903.88 --> 1910.72
guys just wonder if if you would get

1906.91 --> 1913.26
into that or if you wouldn't try out

1910.72 --> 1913.26
something else

1918.97 --> 1923.25
seeking truth is there an experiment

1921.19 --> 1927.39
that can sell this argument either way

1923.25 --> 1932.23
well potentially but it would become so

1927.39 --> 1934.66
freakin complex that it'll never settle

1932.23 --> 1937.0
down people will never agree to it it

1934.66 --> 1940.72
would be become to the same level as the

1937.0 --> 1943.36
weird quantum delayed choice experiment

1940.72 --> 1948.22
which is so convoluted and then very

1943.36 --> 1953.28
presupposition in many ways what yeah I

1948.22 --> 1956.2
could think of something for example

1953.28 --> 1959.02
with the double slit just the basic one

1956.2 --> 1964.9
with the lights right the light going

1959.02 --> 1971.6399999999999
through that what happens when you put

1964.9 --> 1974.95
objects in between the parts where the

1971.64 --> 1976.1200000000001
interference is what the interference is

1974.95 --> 1978.51
where there's no light coming through

1976.12 --> 1983.59
what happens when you put things there

1978.51 --> 1988.21
you know it is basically the the actual

1983.59 --> 1990.82
nature of what really happens why this

1988.21 --> 1994.3
specific pattern why does it split up in

1990.82 --> 1997.51
this ratio that's if that can be figured

1994.3 --> 1999.76
out then potentially the entire mystery

1997.51 --> 2002.52
can be solved but it has to be perfect

1999.76 --> 2008.25
it has to be perfectly understood why

2002.52 --> 2010.8899999999999
exactly the Cascades what is that what

2008.25 --> 2012.9
is the cascade that needs to be

2010.89 --> 2015.9
understood and I could device very

2012.9 --> 2018.27
complex setups that could kind of test

2015.9 --> 2024.75
it it's gonna take I need a laboratory

2018.27 --> 2028.8799999999999
and an assistance I could figure it out

2024.75 --> 2033.66
but it's not gonna be easy if I want it

2028.88 --> 2036.15
but just theorizing about it it's too

2033.66 --> 2039.93
difficult I'd have to I have to have

2036.15 --> 2042.99
visual testing in order to literally see

2039.93 --> 2046.44
and let my intuition grasp what is

2042.99 --> 2053.55
really it and I doubt ya don't have

2046.44 --> 2055.109
right now but I could the my paypal link

2053.55 --> 2058.429
is in the description

2055.109 --> 2058.429
Jason James Mason

2069.26 --> 2073.6090000000004
all right seeking truth the problem is

2071.869 --> 2075.889
as though again

2073.609 --> 2078.74
that's why how I started out have been

2075.889 --> 2082.429
getting really sick of this because the

2078.74 --> 2088.24
politicization concerning the the

2082.429 --> 2090.98
particle wave false dichotomy so bad

2088.24 --> 2094.9089999999997
even if I would have this experiment say

2090.98 --> 2097.01
this that entire group which is

2094.909 --> 2099.38
practically hundreds of people

2097.01 --> 2103.67
throughout history some really old

2099.38 --> 2105.8900000000003
people some younger ones and books and

2103.67 --> 2108.53
books and books and books they're not

2105.89 --> 2110.66
gonna just go with it you think that

2108.53 --> 2113.96
everyone after getting a couple of

2110.66 --> 2115.8489999999997
things from just a random layman guide

2113.96 --> 2117.8
it doesn't even have any graduation in

2115.849 --> 2120.4700000000003
the university or and you think anybody

2117.8 --> 2124.01
cares out there no they're just gonna

2120.47 --> 2125.54
say no whatever it's a particle it's a

2124.01 --> 2127.369
way they're just gonna continue what

2125.54 --> 2128.93
they're gonna do cuz they have four

2127.369 --> 2132.8
freaking eighty years you think that's

2128.93 --> 2134.93
gonna stop with some guy figuring out

2132.8 --> 2136.19
that it might be something else no we're

2134.93 --> 2141.68
just gonna keep on going

2136.19 --> 2143.329
just like religions you know once the

2141.68 --> 2145.2799999999997
division is there it's not gonna stop

2143.329 --> 2146.8100000000004
they are gonna go at it even though it

2145.28 --> 2149.119
may turn out they're both wrong

2146.81 --> 2157.52
no they're they don't care they're too

2149.119 --> 2160.55
caught up in it trust me it's not gonna

2157.52 --> 2163.73
stop even if I if I completely figure

2160.55 --> 2166.01
out the nature from scratch from its

2163.73 --> 2175.0
foundational block the real true

2166.01 --> 2177.1400000000003
absolute precise description and system

2175.0 --> 2179.24
everything that lied if I could figure

2177.14 --> 2182.7799999999997
it it's not gonna help people they're

2179.24 --> 2184.6699999999996
not gonna listen you may listen some

2182.78 --> 2187.099
people may start talking about it

2184.67 --> 2189.17
listening and hearing it's not going to

2187.099 --> 2191.9
dissuade those people up there though

2189.17 --> 2194.27
just hammering books at Eddie

2191.9 --> 2195.98
others head particle wave but they're

2194.27 --> 2197.359
they're just gonna continue they're not

2195.98 --> 2200.21
gonna listen to this [ __ ]

2197.359 --> 2203.27
they don't care not until some big

2200.21 --> 2205.64
player publishes it from one political

2203.27 --> 2208.49
angle in order for the other one to have

2205.64 --> 2211.3089999999997
to then read it to this pellet and then

2208.49 --> 2215.1499999999996
in some way it might be figured out but

2211.309 --> 2217.7000000000003
yeah how is that ever gonna happen

2215.15 --> 2222.109
I don't know I'm a bit pessimistic about

2217.7 --> 2228.4399999999996
this situation I just I'm so sick of

2222.109 --> 2232.16
this politicization within within the

2228.44 --> 2234.619
theoretical community as it were it's

2232.16 --> 2236.6299999999997
the entire theory of theoretical physics

2234.619 --> 2238.849
and all that it's completely poisons

2236.63 --> 2243.279
it's completely poisoned to death it's

2238.849 --> 2245.3590000000004
all hollowed out it's just so

2243.279 --> 2250.089
presuppositional everything's become so

2245.359 --> 2250.089
presuppositional it's it's all hello

2312.39 --> 2320.089
well yeah Rukiya life the whole

2316.259 --> 2320.089
situation was pretty superfluous

2327.109 --> 2333.359
yeah professor Phil belt you are a

2330.27 --> 2335.22
lunatic it cannot be both things the

2333.359 --> 2338.46
contradiction in terms the wave is

2335.22 --> 2341.549
secondary particles primary can't be

2338.46 --> 2345.68
both things can't be both things do you

2341.549 --> 2351.0
think it can then you are a clinical

2345.68 --> 2354.48
lunatic you're broken logic it can be an

2351.0 --> 2356.97
apple and a pear at the same time idiot

2354.48 --> 2358.559
and you can't prove it you can think

2356.97 --> 2361.95
that you can prove it but that's just

2358.559 --> 2364.0690000000004
pure arrogance and folly means you're an

2361.95 --> 2364.069
idiot

2364.609 --> 2371.88
just like Brenda is an idiot

2368.74 --> 2371.8799999999997

[Music]

2386.37 --> 2392.73
oh really no rikiya life

2389.43 --> 2396.99
so I've ever heard off the burnout

2392.73 --> 2400.47
concept you know sometimes certain

2396.99 --> 2403.29
places if you just pour like for example

2400.47 --> 2405.48
a lot of oxygen or extra types of quick

2403.29 --> 2408.36
burning fuel over it it may actually

2405.48 --> 2410.31
kill the fire it may smother it burn it

2408.36 --> 2412.23
out quickly so it doesn't keep on

2410.31 --> 2415.44
expanding if you just let it smolder

2412.23 --> 2418.14
well then it can expand because it won't

2415.44 --> 2420.54
it will just keep on getting its oxygen

2418.14 --> 2425.22
there's plenty of wood around and all

2420.54 --> 2427.95
that so I disagree if we just left this

2425.22 --> 2432.47
cap smothering what would have happened

2427.95 --> 2436.5899999999997
is that I would have retracted

2432.47 --> 2439.98
eventually from stress from being stuck

2436.59 --> 2442.05
between a rock and a hard place not

2439.98 --> 2446.19
being able to get it out not getting the

2442.05 --> 2449.19
answers I need and yeah that is just

2446.19 --> 2453.03
goodbye and then you wouldn't even have

2449.19 --> 2455.1
known really why and then everybody

2453.03 --> 2457.23
would just go along peacefully and then

2455.1 --> 2459.45
get caught up in the whole fray of the

2457.23 --> 2465.06
particle wave false dichotomy

2459.45 --> 2467.5499999999997
politicization nonsense as usual so no

2465.06 --> 2472.59
I'm pretty sure it needed to be said

2467.55 --> 2476.46
and this is not about my will or ability

2472.59 --> 2480.42
to find things on the internet this was

2476.46 --> 2487.62
about a man that's supposedly teaching

2480.42 --> 2492.48
us that makes claims and then you'd

2487.62 --> 2495.6
expect him to provide the direct

2492.48 --> 2498.33
evidence for a claim not some general

2495.6 --> 2501.75
reference or some general paper but a

2498.33 --> 2504.6
direct reference the forthcoming

2501.75 --> 2508.74
evidence and he's never done that just

2504.6 --> 2513.0299999999997
never done it he says he does it he

2508.74 --> 2518.06
doesn't because it's just he Bluffs he

2513.03 --> 2521.84
lies John lies a lot

2518.06 --> 2525.47
about what he does what he did I don't

2521.84 --> 2528.02
even know if people notice it I'm just

2525.47 --> 2529.0699999999997
really sick of it and I don't care

2528.02 --> 2537.62
anymore

2529.07 --> 2540.02
I really don't don't care what he thinks

2537.62 --> 2542.62
don't care if he's now gonna put me in

2540.02 --> 2544.79
the [ __ ] hole or whatever he's

2542.62 --> 2545.7999999999997
designated others to do I don't give a

2544.79 --> 2551.6
[ __ ]

2545.8 --> 2554.63
he lies a lot about little things not a

2551.6 --> 2561.29
big things necessarily little things a

2554.63 --> 2563.9300000000003
lot we're sick of it I'm not willing to

2561.29 --> 2566.8
overlook it as a personality Cork

2563.93 --> 2566.7999999999997
anymore

2569.84 --> 2575.79
[Music]

2572.75 --> 2579.839
no he doesn't cherry-pick science

2575.79 --> 2583.74
articles Zep tepi he provides evidence

2579.839 --> 2586.41
and then he sources that evidence in an

2583.74 --> 2589.7599999999998
argument in a case that's not

2586.41 --> 2593.3689999999997
cherry-picking don't you freaking dare

2589.76 --> 2597.9300000000003
assert you're a baller [ __ ] on top of

2593.369 --> 2601.5
this internal Flat Earth issue dick or

2597.93 --> 2603.81
you want to get banned as well yeah yeah

2601.5 --> 2607.68
you know what concerning everything

2603.81 --> 2611.04
globe and everything evolution related

2607.68 --> 2615.4199999999996
all that well guess what despite all of

2611.04 --> 2619.55
this internal [ __ ] despite the lies the

2615.42 --> 2622.079
personal lies right we're just exposed

2619.55 --> 2625.71
there's nothing to do with this

2622.079 --> 2628.349
arguments concerning Flat Earth creation

2625.71 --> 2631.32
cuz he's right he's still right about

2628.349 --> 2634.2000000000003
that yeah you got nothing you can think

2631.32 --> 2637.069
of having something now because John is

2634.2 --> 2641.31
not a perfect human being but you don't

2637.069 --> 2643.23
because he doesn't cherry-pick he

2641.31 --> 2645.569
actually knows what he's talking about

2643.23 --> 2650.069
when it comes to that kind of thing this

2645.569 --> 2652.55
is not about that yeah alrighty then

2650.069 --> 2652.55
yeah

2724.13 --> 2727.3

2732.16 --> 2737.52

no it's mostly just Nathan

2770.52 --> 2777.86
[Music]

2792.88 --> 2801.9100000000003
all right yeah well Sept Appy that's

2799.029 --> 2806.849
really nice but he doesn't really

2801.91 --> 2812.759
cherry-pick he provides relevant sources

2806.849 --> 2817.69
for his arguments that are actually back

2812.759 --> 2820.869
and that are well overall technically

2817.69 --> 2826.42
sound sound enough more sound than most

2820.869 --> 2828.599
people's arguments so right that's not

2826.42 --> 2835.259
really the issue that the issue is not

2828.599 --> 2837.19
how the integrity of his structural

2835.259 --> 2840.88
conceptualizations and the information

2837.19 --> 2845.91
though the problem is is the the lack of

2840.88 --> 2849.69
forthcoming nests and the attitude and

2845.91 --> 2851.95
basically the - the two-faced effect of

2849.69 --> 2854.89
upholding others by certain standards

2851.95 --> 2857.14
but not yourself that's the problem and

2854.89 --> 2863.64
it's nothing to do with the quality of

2857.14 --> 2867.3289999999997
his information or the arguments so yeah

2863.64 --> 2867.3289999999997
not cherry-picking

2874.46 --> 2877.63
[Music]

2879.38 --> 2887.3
this is yeah well peach Jo like peach a

2884.79 --> 2889.11
shines every time somebody else falls

2887.3 --> 2891.09
it's like a vampire

2889.11 --> 2893.3700000000003
every time somebody else just likes

2891.09 --> 2896.13
really something goes to [ __ ] then

2893.37 --> 2898.77
suddenly peach a gets all this greatest

2896.13 --> 2900.9900000000002
calm energy and suddenly he actually

2898.77 --> 2903.15
starts to make half way sense for a few

2900.99 --> 2907.3799999999997
minutes yeah that happens every time

2903.15 --> 2908.85
every single time somebody falls happens

2907.38 --> 2913.19
to him because he's a vampire

2908.85 --> 2915.45
it's a freaking spirit vampire that guy

2913.19 --> 2916.17
and when everybody's doing great he

2915.45 --> 2918.81
sucks

2916.17 --> 2925.5
he's just stumbling around and whining

2918.81 --> 2928.77
bleeding you know this is true I'm not

2925.5 --> 2931.16
saying he's a literal vampire that's I

2928.77 --> 2931.16
don't care

2937.07 --> 2940.07
agencies

2947.63 --> 2955.9100000000003
yeah Bronte yeah I'm gonna round out the

2950.479 --> 2964.7889999999998
show too because I I just need to have a

2955.91 --> 2965.739
calm day today and I can't hold out for

2964.789 --> 2968.989

2982.69 --> 2989.359
Skype call afterward cuz I could use

2985.999 --> 2992.9889999999996
some of that maybe draw so many other

2989.359 --> 2995.39
people in on it too maybe even have

2992.989 --> 3005.259
another show about it or whatever with

2995.39 --> 3007.5989999999997
just more people but yeah for now I am

3005.259 --> 3010.21
gonna round out the show so sorry if

3007.599 --> 3011.739
we're not having a two-hour show today

3010.21 --> 3019.989
it's just that I don't really feel like

3011.739 --> 3021.94
it and it's not that I'm not rested by

3019.989 --> 3024.4
the way because I did rest pretty well

3021.94 --> 3026.9790000000003
this night didn't go to bed too late but

3024.4 --> 3033.67
still I just the whole situation kind of

3026.979 --> 3036.0989999999997
stresses me out anyway Wow look at the

3033.67 --> 3038.9990000000003
downvotes trolls are so seriously

3036.099 --> 3041.739
triggered here it's just crazy

3038.999 --> 3044.229
it's like they keep on growing worse

3041.739 --> 3048.069
it's like are they really trying to set

3044.229 --> 3053.739
a record here is is there some troll

3048.069 --> 3057.249
Society going around like gathering what

3053.739 --> 3060.369
is it pledges to download every single

3057.249 --> 3062.14
Arwen hangout ever and the people that

3060.369 --> 3064.299
are going they that are growing because

3062.14 --> 3067.569
it seems like the amount of downvotes

3064.299 --> 3069.96
again every day just seems to grow it's

3067.569 --> 3069.96
crazy

3071.64 --> 3079.87
there this just this demonic consensus

3076.45 --> 3082.24
among groups that yeah Arwen he is the

3079.87 --> 3084.6099999999997
worst he must go we're not gonna

3082.24 --> 3087.91
actually think about why or anything

3084.61 --> 3090.34
it's just that he is the worst we hate

3087.91 --> 3094.1499999999996
everything he says don't really know why

3090.34 --> 3096.01
but hey our demons tell us we have to do

3094.15 --> 3098.56
this [ __ ] we have to download this show

3096.01 --> 3100.8700000000003
every single day and we will do it and

3098.56 --> 3102.79
we will start to associate just the look

3100.87 --> 3104.65
of his face which is very similar I'll

3102.79 --> 3107.2599999999998
always have the same clothes of the same

3104.65 --> 3110.08
background so it becomes like very easy

3107.26 --> 3111.8500000000004
to everytime associate the face not even

3110.08 --> 3114.85
listen to the words not listen to

3111.85 --> 3116.44
anything and just think oh it's him so

3114.85 --> 3121.6
downvote oh we hate him

3116.44 --> 3124.87
weird him it's very special it's not

3121.6 --> 3129.0699999999997
gonna prevent me from continuing though

3124.87 --> 3130.5699999999997
because even if literally the counter

3129.07 --> 3133.75
would break because there would be

3130.57 --> 3137.98
millions of downloads every single day

3133.75 --> 3141.72
I'd still keep on going because I don't

3137.98 --> 3145.15
care how many people dislike the show

3141.72 --> 3148.6299999999997
what I really care about is people that

3145.15 --> 3151.78
do care about it and that'll be willing

3148.63 --> 3153.94
to interact with me in the chat and then

3151.78 --> 3161.6800000000003
eventually I get to consider some of

3153.94 --> 3165.13
them as my friends and that's the people

3161.68 --> 3165.64
I care about so yeah keep on doing what

3165.13 --> 3168.79
you're doing

3165.64 --> 3173.64
keep on conspiring to pile on the

3168.79 --> 3178.3
Downloads every single day every day

3173.64 --> 3181.0
just like my show that's all fine you

3178.3 --> 3184.0
know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna turn it

3181.0 --> 3187.68
off either okay and it's gonna be

3184.0 --> 3191.56
visible yeah people are gonna see that

3187.68 --> 3193.8399999999997
there's this weird people pouring in the

3191.56 --> 3197.58
down votes even though I'm a pretty

3193.84 --> 3200.4700000000003
decent guy I'm not really overtly

3197.58 --> 3203.68
disgusting or bigoted or anything in a

3200.47 --> 3206.8399999999997
really bad way

3203.68 --> 3209.1499999999996
other than flat earth versus global but

3206.84 --> 3212.36
that is kind of obvious and I still try

3209.15 --> 3213.6800000000003
to be somewhat decent with it not go too

3212.36 --> 3216.23
far and all that

3213.68 --> 3218.69
it's like she's looking other regions

3216.23 --> 3222.38
for example politics people get so much

3218.69 --> 3225.9500000000003
worse with that so everybody can see wow

3222.38 --> 3228.8900000000003
that's a big pile of down votes but hey

3225.95 --> 3233.6
this guy isn't really that nasty what's

3228.89 --> 3236.15
going on here so keep on doing that keep

3233.6 --> 3239.5699999999997
on doing it it's actually helping and

3236.15 --> 3242.12
I'm not gonna turn off the visuals like

3239.57 --> 3245.3900000000003
so many other people do and I'm gonna

3242.12 --> 3249.43
turn it off oh my god otherwise people

3245.39 --> 3252.77
can see that I'm not popular oh no oh no

3249.43 --> 3257.48
the down votes oh my god the down votes

3252.77 --> 3260.09
oh no no no I don't care it doesn't

3257.48 --> 3262.52
actually hurt me I just find it's

3260.09 --> 3265.1600000000003
suspect and it's a telling sign of this

3262.52 --> 3269.98
time that there is just really weirdo

3265.16 --> 3272.87
people out there that make actual effort

3269.98 --> 3278.6
to do something like that persistently

3272.87 --> 3281.96
and I find that more interesting then

3278.6 --> 3284.86
that I'd have that it that it would have

3281.96 --> 3291.98
any kind of weights as to oh my god

3284.86 --> 3294.98
no because I really don't care I really

3291.98 --> 3299.75
don't not about that it's all just a

3294.98 --> 3302.78
bunch of socks anyway so anyway thanks
