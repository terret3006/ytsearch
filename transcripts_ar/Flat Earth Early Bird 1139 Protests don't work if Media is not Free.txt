I'm hoping it's gonna be this weather

121.14 --> 125.18
all weekend that would be great

126.06 --> 128.719
beautiful

129.0 --> 135.06
there's a whole bunch of people outside

132.9 --> 138.0
I went out for groceries and it was like

135.06 --> 140.58
really crowded outside all that really

138.0 --> 143.64
crowded it was more crowded than it has

140.58 --> 145.86
been last in the last week

143.64 --> 148.61999999999998
because everybody's going outside to

145.86 --> 151.26000000000002
absorb some of this some

148.62 --> 153.54
it's like a lot of cafes had people

151.26 --> 156.54
sitting sitting there right outside

153.54 --> 159.12
catching some sun and all that

156.54 --> 162.42
yeah really nice day today

159.12 --> 164.4
it's also the reason I'm late

162.42 --> 166.92
because I thought I'm gonna get

164.4 --> 169.4
groceries even though didn't have too

166.92 --> 169.39999999999998
much time

170.4 --> 175.98000000000002
because I just wanted to catch that sun

172.44 --> 178.5
in case it was gonna go away again but

175.98 --> 180.89999999999998
it hasn't so far so it looks really

178.5 --> 182.76
promising

180.9 --> 186.42000000000002
ah

182.76 --> 188.34
anyway hello keflar first to chat good

186.42 --> 194.099
morning

188.34 --> 196.44
it is Friday the 28th of January 2022

194.099 --> 198.23899999999998
uh yeah I'm almost starting an hour late

196.44 --> 201.06
but

198.239 --> 204.06
just got word from Nathan that there's

201.06 --> 206.7
not going to be a live fed

204.06 --> 208.799
so I think I'm gonna just well since I'm

206.7 --> 211.61999999999998
starting late anyway I'm just gonna keep

208.799 --> 212.58
on going with my show maybe even

211.62 --> 215.34
if

212.58 --> 219.18
if the guys are up for it

215.34 --> 221.4
open up a Google Plus panel and and get

219.18 --> 222.959
them in if yeah

221.4 --> 225.06
if they wanna

222.959 --> 226.56
it's not like oh I really have to do

225.06 --> 230.099
that but

226.56 --> 234.92000000000002
if they're like ah we we wanted to be on

230.099 --> 234.92
the show then I will try to provide that

236.939 --> 241.439
also I've been thinking

239.159 --> 244.85999999999999
would be pretty cool if there was some

241.439 --> 248.159
kind of a standard setup I could arrange

244.86 --> 250.019
OBS in in order to do that because yeah

248.159 --> 252.06
the way the the graphics now and all

250.019 --> 255.48000000000002
that the background is arranged it's

252.06 --> 258.6
really just a one-man show with a chat

255.48 --> 262.44
would be kind of cool to maybe

258.6 --> 265.38
have another version of this layout

262.44 --> 268.02
that would be adapted to having a Google

265.38 --> 270.6
Plus panel in there visibly

268.02 --> 272.46
that would be cool

270.6 --> 277.34000000000003
right so I have to talk to Adam about

272.46 --> 277.34
that see if he can think of something

278.04 --> 284.90000000000003
on this day in

281.06 --> 284.9
1986 what

286.259 --> 290.54
what is so special about this lady

287.88 --> 290.54
Kevlar

306.38 --> 310.039
Challenger oh God

311.88 --> 317.46
yeah that's

314.419 --> 320.65999999999997
I don't have a particularly good memory

317.46 --> 320.65999999999997
for those types of dates

320.9 --> 327.29999999999995
Olaf tell me

324.24 --> 329.52
I that doesn't ring a bell either a

327.3 --> 333.479
heart moot

329.52 --> 333.479
holes graphic

335.039 --> 338.479
sorry anyway

340.259 --> 342.8
so

344.699 --> 349.34000000000003
yeah feeling a lot more awake today

350.4 --> 354.9
I'm gonna say it's because of the Sun

352.259 --> 356.52000000000004
but it's also because I had a good sleep

354.9 --> 359.09999999999997
and

356.52 --> 363.06
yeah like having that washing machine

359.1 --> 365.759
again was certainly like a real big

363.06 --> 368.639
plus because

365.759 --> 371.46000000000004
yeah hasn't been basically washing

368.639 --> 373.319
anything for

371.46 --> 376.919
almost a month

373.319 --> 379.62
can't believe that the way I my supplies

376.919 --> 382.08
work my clothing and all that I can

379.62 --> 385.199
actually haul out for that long

382.08 --> 387.539
so but yeah

385.199 --> 390.0
been doing a whole bunch of washing and

387.539 --> 391.68
including my bed and that was kind of

390.0 --> 393.78
necessary because I hadn't even done

391.68 --> 396.419
that

393.78 --> 399.59999999999997
since like the last time

396.419 --> 403.68
I drank like that absent and got all

399.6 --> 405.96000000000004
sick so it was it was like Yeah I wanted

403.68 --> 406.68
to put that in the wash for quite a

405.96 --> 409.19899999999996
while

406.68 --> 411.36
and I have and it's great I had a really

409.199 --> 414.02000000000004
good sleep last night

411.36 --> 414.02000000000004
this night

414.24 --> 419.3
prime minister of Sweden at the time oh

416.639 --> 419.3
okay

429.599 --> 436.979
right yeah I've heard that Sweden kind

433.979 --> 440.65999999999997
of has a history of

436.979 --> 440.65999999999997
that sort of thing happening

440.819 --> 445.56
like that's not super rare

443.34 --> 448.46
over there

445.56 --> 448.46
so I've heard

450.36 --> 455.16
right

451.74 --> 457.199
I I don't know who he was though

455.16 --> 459.06
I know very little about Swedish

457.199 --> 461.28000000000003
politics and all that

459.06 --> 465.599
it's only really

461.28 --> 469.02
that it grabbed my attention in the last

465.599 --> 471.06
10 years when I gotten to know the

469.02 --> 473.21999999999997
Swedish guy from my role-playing group

471.06 --> 476.28000000000003
the role-playing group is broken up

473.22 --> 479.03900000000004
since then since Corona

476.28 --> 480.78
fortunately and it's only after that

479.039 --> 483.06
point where I kind of like started to

480.78 --> 486.05999999999995
pay more attention to Sweden and

483.06 --> 490.039
well they are locked down or rather the

486.06 --> 490.039
lack of lockdown response and all that

490.319 --> 495.97900000000004
right the trauma was worldwide okay

505.979 --> 512.8199999999999
right the challengers is the

510.06 --> 515.779
that's like the the NASA project that

512.82 --> 515.779
blew up wasn't it

516.06 --> 520.0989999999999
big big fiery explosion

521.82 --> 525.9590000000001
where

523.32 --> 527.519
nobody survived yet they all have twins

525.959 --> 531.1999999999999
that's the one right

527.519 --> 531.2
I hope I remember that correctly

541.2 --> 546.62
right yeah I I do remember that that

543.54 --> 546.62
made a lot of impact

556.38 --> 560.519
because

558.18 --> 563.779
I think that it might have also been

560.519 --> 563.779
kind of the turning point

563.94 --> 568.5600000000001
of

565.74 --> 569.519
where NASA after that point no longer

568.56 --> 572.0999999999999
really

569.519 --> 574.76
was doing its best

572.1 --> 574.76
is there any

575.64 --> 581.16
any legitimacy to this to making such a

578.399 --> 583.68
statement I'm not sure

581.16 --> 586.0799999999999
but before that I'm pretty sure that

583.68 --> 587.8199999999999
everybody was very much just about the

586.08 --> 590.64
dream and really kind of believed it

587.82 --> 591.779
like like it was for something good and

590.64 --> 593.3389999999999
all that

591.779 --> 597.06
and

593.339 --> 599.7
I'm pretty sure that most of my years

597.06 --> 601.8599999999999
the actual new things NASA has had been

599.7 --> 604.38
doing has been pretty

601.86 --> 607.32
shitty and

604.38 --> 609.36
like promoting starting to get involved

607.32 --> 610.98
with climate change [ __ ] and all

609.36 --> 612.9590000000001
that

610.98 --> 614.279
starting to get like politically

612.959 --> 616.9799999999999
involved

614.279 --> 620.0
so like the Challenger might have been

616.98 --> 621.779
like the Tipping Point as to where

620.0 --> 626.519
NASA's

621.779 --> 629.7
public relations attitude had changed

626.519 --> 632.24
is there did I'm basically guessing this

629.7 --> 632.24
right

633.839 --> 638.399
but I think that might be right because

636.36 --> 640.26
it just roughly size it up everything

638.399 --> 642.899
before that time it was all like

640.26 --> 645.48
sparkling and like yeah

642.899 --> 648.54
you know the moon landing hobo Fortress

645.48 --> 651.12
and all that but still like the

648.54 --> 653.0999999999999
the atmosphere the energy that

651.12 --> 655.64
surrounded it all was still kind of

653.1 --> 655.64
positive

657.18 --> 662.2199999999999
and I remember that during most of my

659.94 --> 665.1
life that NASA's stuff happened every

662.22 --> 666.5400000000001
time I faced it I was disappointed every

665.1 --> 671.0
single time

666.54 --> 671.0
even from a believer's perspective

672.48 --> 677.76
so it might have been like the the NASA

675.18 --> 681.18
corruption moment

677.76 --> 684.66
personally they the entire

681.18 --> 687.12
energy of the organization turned around

684.66 --> 688.62
all right anyway Hello Elijah good to

687.12 --> 691.8
see you

688.62 --> 693.54
no fvd today unfortunately

691.8 --> 695.88
but I'm gonna do a little bit longer

693.54 --> 700.2199999999999
show and it might open up a panel

695.88 --> 700.22
if the guys if you guys want to

703.8 --> 707.54

708.72 --> 717.8000000000001

lots of different stuff some of which I

783.48 --> 788.73
have absolutely no idea what it is but

786.48 --> 791.799
it's it feels good

788.73 --> 791.799
[Music]

792.36 --> 798.3000000000001
hello steamy Traveler

795.24 --> 799.98
a geoshifter

798.3 --> 804.5999999999999
space rocket

799.98 --> 807.48
SpaceX is gonna crash into the moon okay

804.6 --> 810.62
and they're doing another thing

807.48 --> 810.62
hey Adam Price

821.959 --> 825.77
U.S federal budget does not so good I

825.06 --> 828.0
don't know

825.77 --> 831.5
[Music]

828.0 --> 831.5
I don't know steamy Traveler

842.519 --> 848.279
I have no idea what their budget is

844.68 --> 850.92
these days I don't know if it's

848.279 --> 854.54
still the same on the same level or if

850.92 --> 854.54
it's gradually going down

856.98 --> 862.4590000000001
I mean to do what they typically always

860.639 --> 866.339
have done

862.459 --> 868.1389999999999
nowadays in this era is cheaper so they

866.339 --> 871.399
probably could achieve anything they

868.139 --> 875.42
wanted to with lesser budget

871.399 --> 875.42
sorry about that NASA

876.12 --> 879.74
but that's just true

885.959 --> 892.199
Google says about half a percent of

888.66 --> 895.079
total US government spending sheesh

892.199 --> 897.3
yeah NASA budget is still gonna be huge

895.079 --> 899.88
but yeah if you compare that to the

897.3 --> 901.56
amount of money that is spent on the

899.88 --> 903.66
entirety of the military industrial

901.56 --> 908.3599999999999
complex

903.66 --> 908.36
it's not that huge really

922.199 --> 925.88
hello Lydia logs

926.06 --> 932.579
jogs but I'm gonna call you logs

929.88 --> 934.8
yeah half a percent so what's the other

932.579 --> 938.279
99

934.8 --> 940.2589999999999
and a half percent spent on you know I

938.279 --> 944.3389999999999
think that

940.259 --> 946.74
the amount of money spent on Military

944.339 --> 948.86
is quite a lot higher than half a

946.74 --> 948.86
percent

961.56 --> 966.8
indeed Rocket Man

963.6 --> 966.8000000000001
that was my point

967.079 --> 970.92
and I think that probably

969.24 --> 974.22
look the problem

970.92 --> 976.4399999999999
the me butting in again right I think

974.22 --> 978.899
that the U.S military

976.44 --> 982.8000000000001
the amount of money that they use it's

978.899 --> 986.1
overspending why because

982.8 --> 989.3
U.S military seems to operate more like

986.1 --> 989.3000000000001
a a guild

989.579 --> 994.519
in a way

991.079 --> 994.519
the generals and all that

997.5 --> 1000.399
and

1002.42 --> 1008.0
I don't think they're just they're just

1004.699 --> 1009.56
they don't seem to be very efficient

1008.0 --> 1011.6
right

1009.56 --> 1014.4799999999999
it's kind of like a corporation that's

1011.6 --> 1015.5600000000001
just like staying relevant and scooping

1014.48 --> 1017.779
money

1015.56 --> 1020.8389999999999
and then yeah they they still have to be

1017.779 --> 1023.959
effective or it's all for nothing

1020.839 --> 1027.14
but I think that you as military the way

1023.959 --> 1028.579
it operates is probably like overly

1027.14 --> 1032.3190000000002
costly

1028.579 --> 1032.319
it's like high maintenance

1040.22 --> 1047.72
right but yeah it's not exactly the

1044.12 --> 1051.799
the time to start reorganizing like in

1047.72 --> 1053.9
the middle of an attempt of or overt

1051.799 --> 1055.16
Communist Revolution and all that it's

1053.9 --> 1058.22
not really the time to start

1055.16 --> 1061.22
reorganizing if you know what I mean

1058.22 --> 1061.22
uh

1065.66 --> 1070.3600000000001
okay chosen one don't address me as

1067.88 --> 1070.3600000000001
Baldwin

1087.44 --> 1091.3600000000001
right yeah that's a lot of money

1093.2 --> 1098.98
actually if you compare that to the

1096.26 --> 1098.98
amount of population

1099.08 --> 1102.3999999999999
that's quite insane

1104.0 --> 1111.32
because weren't there like 350 or 400

1109.22 --> 1114.38
million

1111.32 --> 1116.32
people in the United States

1114.38 --> 1119.6000000000001
well

1116.32 --> 1124.1789999999999
750 billion dollars

1119.6 --> 1128.1999999999998
that would make roughly 2 million

1124.179 --> 1128.2
dollars a person

1130.1 --> 1136.059
in a year

1131.84 --> 1136.059
on a military wouldn't it

1137.48 --> 1140.72
or

1139.1 --> 1143.299
am I right

1140.72 --> 1147.64
Miss calc yeah a billion is a million

1143.299 --> 1147.6399999999999
million right no it's a thousand million

1148.94 --> 1154.22
wait let me

1152.059 --> 1156.46
see you later damn I'm getting worse at

1154.22 --> 1156.46
math

1163.66 --> 1170.0800000000002
or I'm gonna just say 400 million

1172.58 --> 1180.559
wait no no no it's not a million it's

1175.46 --> 1184.3600000000001
it's like two thousand dollars a person

1180.559 --> 1184.36
on the military in a year

1185.9 --> 1193.8200000000002
that's still like for a year guys that's

1189.62 --> 1196.58
a lot of money that every person

1193.82 --> 1198.6789999999999
every person in the United States that

1196.58 --> 1203.32
includes babies

1198.679 --> 1203.3200000000002
they're basically vouching for

1203.48 --> 1207.38
yeah between a thousand and two thousand

1206.299 --> 1210.3799999999999
dollars

1207.38 --> 1213.3200000000002
on the military of the nation supposedly

1210.38 --> 1215.7990000000002
the military industrial complex in a

1213.32 --> 1215.799
single year

1216.799 --> 1221.799
that's that seems kind of excessive

1227.84 --> 1233.36
not saying that the U.S shouldn't have a

1230.659 --> 1235.159
really good an up-to-date military but

1233.36 --> 1237.8799999999999
is that really what you're getting for

1235.159 --> 1237.88
all that money

1238.4 --> 1244.76
like what is the US military specialism

1242.0 --> 1247.64
even these days what is their Edge above

1244.76 --> 1249.62
other big militaries in the world to

1247.64 --> 1251.48
have all that money spent on them what

1249.62 --> 1254.059
is their why how did they develop with

1251.48 --> 1256.299
all that money right

1254.059 --> 1259.3999999999999
I mean are they now

1256.299 --> 1261.3799999999999
psychological warfare specialist is that

1259.4 --> 1262.64
their upgrade or

1261.38 --> 1264.14
like

1262.64 --> 1266.179
is it

1264.14 --> 1269.38
Secret

1266.179 --> 1271.76
like technological integration

1269.38 --> 1274.1000000000001
transhumanist military development and

1271.76 --> 1275.9
they're still keeping it secret is that

1274.1 --> 1277.6399999999999
the upgrade

1275.9 --> 1281.48
all right

1277.64 --> 1284.539
are there more lineups of super heavy

1281.48 --> 1286.6
high-tech developed equipment that's

1284.539 --> 1289.1
still kind of like being kept secret

1286.6 --> 1293.12
that they're gonna enroll what is all

1289.1 --> 1295.34
that money where is it all gone to

1293.12 --> 1297.8799999999999
for what they've basically delivered in

1295.34 --> 1297.8799999999999
all that time

1298.88 --> 1305.98
how does the US military truly justify

1302.6 --> 1305.98
all that money spent

1306.2 --> 1313.9
between a thousand and two thousand

1308.24 --> 1313.9
dollars per American including babies

1316.22 --> 1321.08
you might want to think about that and

1318.559 --> 1323.24
with that I mean like everyone everyone

1321.08 --> 1325.46
in the United States including the

1323.24 --> 1327.1
military including the generals

1325.46 --> 1329.3600000000001
including

1327.1 --> 1331.3999999999999
proponents opponents of the military

1329.36 --> 1336.58
think about that

1331.4 --> 1336.5800000000002
is this working is this really wise

1338.24 --> 1342.559
because a military organization

1343.039 --> 1350.419
that is bound to a nation and taxes it

1346.76 --> 1352.82
can't just pretend to be really strong

1350.419 --> 1356.26
and suck up a lot of money and then not

1352.82 --> 1356.26
deliver you see

1361.52 --> 1368.179
just think about it right because I mean

1365.36 --> 1369.9189999999999
the military there the the soldiers that

1368.179 --> 1371.659
enlist

1369.919 --> 1374.2990000000002
or that even become like really

1371.659 --> 1376.64
professional military in the US they're

1374.299 --> 1377.9
proud people they take their job very

1376.64 --> 1380.419
serious

1377.9 --> 1383.48
and they they're usually or they start

1380.419 --> 1385.2800000000002
out with nationalistic sentiment which

1383.48 --> 1387.4
is a good thing

1385.28 --> 1392.9189999999999
but

1387.4 --> 1392.919
does the military actually deliver that

1393.44 --> 1396.159
you see

1409.64 --> 1412.24
right

1415.1 --> 1420.32
I think that

1417.14 --> 1422.8400000000001
I've been thinking for a while that

1420.32 --> 1427.22
the thing that can potentially save

1422.84 --> 1429.74
America from this Communist Revolution

1427.22 --> 1430.7
and the self-destruction that they bring

1429.74 --> 1432.799
with him

1430.7 --> 1434.8400000000001
because that's what they do

1432.799 --> 1439.36
so the Communist revolutions do they

1434.84 --> 1439.36
destroy countries they destroy him

1439.82 --> 1443.36
right

1441.08 --> 1445.58
I think that the only real thing that

1443.36 --> 1448.1589999999999
could completely

1445.58 --> 1450.4399999999998
change it is like a a military

1448.159 --> 1454.46
Revolution a Grassroots military

1450.44 --> 1456.679
Revolution where basically the yeah the

1454.46 --> 1459.14
highly politicized corrupted generals

1456.679 --> 1462.26
that are part of the the Communist

1459.14 --> 1464.6000000000001
Revolution are unseated are ejected

1462.26 --> 1466.64
maybe that's even gonna cause some

1464.6 --> 1468.1399999999999
internal War

1466.64 --> 1471.76
right

1468.14 --> 1471.76
but I think that if that's done

1472.1 --> 1479.299
that that is the only real chance for

1475.4 --> 1483.38
America to actually evade

1479.299 --> 1486.5
the Doom that is crouching up on them

1483.38 --> 1489.5590000000002
through sheer military force

1486.5 --> 1492.32
but then you have to first undo the

1489.559 --> 1494.24
corruption in the military

1492.32 --> 1496.279
I think a lot of people have been hoping

1494.24 --> 1497.84
this and thinking this well guess what

1496.279 --> 1499.46
it doesn't seem like it's being

1497.84 --> 1501.1399999999999
organized right

1499.46 --> 1503.059
you're just all being played you're

1501.14 --> 1505.5800000000002
being graveled

1503.059 --> 1507.799
literally Grabbers coming in selling you

1505.58 --> 1508.9399999999998
hoping oh that's gonna happen oh look

1507.799 --> 1512.4189999999999
we're doing this we're doing this

1508.94 --> 1516.02
protest oh it's so working so well for

1512.419 --> 1519.3200000000002
you it's working so well yeah maybe we

1516.02 --> 1523.279
should just keep on buying into the same

1519.32 --> 1526.76
opium strategy that doesn't deliver

1523.279 --> 1528.559
like a junkie who doesn't know what else

1526.76 --> 1530.48
to do

1528.559 --> 1533.059
right or

1530.48 --> 1535.52
you could actually say hey

1533.059 --> 1537.6789999999999
all you freaks that are trying to play

1535.52 --> 1539.6589999999999
us go [ __ ] yourself

1537.679 --> 1544.3400000000001
we're no longer playing along with this

1539.659 --> 1544.3400000000001
we're gonna do it our way Grassroots

1546.919 --> 1550.2990000000002
talking about the military

1553.46 --> 1558.74
to get like to really become a

1556.159 --> 1561.38
decentralized constitutional operating

1558.74 --> 1564.679
military

1561.38 --> 1568.88
yeah you're like directed by the chain

1564.679 --> 1568.88
of command and all that but

1569.059 --> 1576.46
that should never take away those roots

1571.88 --> 1576.46
of what what it's really all about

1576.62 --> 1584.059
the law the Constitution under God

1580.4 --> 1586.88
in the country saving your people saving

1584.059 --> 1590.539
morality doing the right thing all these

1586.88 --> 1590.5390000000002
core components

1599.96 --> 1604.46
right so

1601.7 --> 1608.059
maybe that's that's the real route to go

1604.46 --> 1610.4
because like all this protest [ __ ]

1608.059 --> 1611.12
Owen Benjamin's also been harping on

1610.4 --> 1613.76
this

1611.12 --> 1615.6789999999999
latest show that I've been watching and

1613.76 --> 1617.36
yeah it's totally right and I've said it

1615.679 --> 1619.279
before like I think protests are

1617.36 --> 1622.8999999999999
completely useless I actually wanted to

1619.279 --> 1622.9
talk about that as a subject today

1623.0 --> 1628.7
because what is protesting

1626.48 --> 1630.44
where did it come from

1628.7 --> 1631.88
why

1630.44 --> 1633.14
how

1631.88 --> 1636.64
right

1633.14 --> 1636.64
I think protesting

1637.1 --> 1641.48
was

1638.84 --> 1645.8799999999999
a natural response

1641.48 --> 1649.3600000000001
to Media the First Media Radio

1645.88 --> 1651.679
especially TV I think that the TV

1649.36 --> 1654.799
revolutionized the effect

1651.679 --> 1657.02
protest because what is protest protest

1654.799 --> 1660.02
is taking a stand

1657.02 --> 1662.36
and then communicating that to the world

1660.02 --> 1664.279
with an image like a huge amount of

1662.36 --> 1667.1
people standing there we won't take this

1664.279 --> 1668.6
we won't take this right that's a

1667.1 --> 1671.9599999999998
communication

1668.6 --> 1674.059
and it spreads rapidly because you see

1671.96 --> 1676.88
it bang it makes an impact you know

1674.059 --> 1678.62
they're doing that you know the message

1676.88 --> 1680.419
and that they're all standing behind it

1678.62 --> 1683.6
in just a quick glance

1680.419 --> 1686.419
unless some blabber is just misinforming

1683.6 --> 1688.6999999999998
you about it telling you some stupid

1686.419 --> 1692.0590000000002
political story nonsense

1688.7 --> 1693.8600000000001
right but in general you see it do you

1692.059 --> 1696.1399999999999
see the protest through

1693.86 --> 1699.3799999999999
television and that's what made

1696.14 --> 1702.5590000000002
protesting so strong right that white

1699.38 --> 1705.38
peaked in the 60s

1702.559 --> 1706.82
where the television really became more

1705.38 --> 1709.88
standardized

1706.82 --> 1712.22
and it's like yeah hippie Revolution

1709.88 --> 1714.5
we're protesting like protesting

1712.22 --> 1716.059
suddenly became like a live motto in a

1714.5 --> 1719.0
way like your protesting you're always

1716.059 --> 1721.94
protesting the system right well that

1719.0 --> 1724.76
all came from the television

1721.94 --> 1726.1000000000001
right because before the age of the

1724.76 --> 1730.1589999999999
television

1726.1 --> 1733.1589999999999
protesting wasn't that effective

1730.159 --> 1736.0390000000002
right you could the the only real power

1733.159 --> 1738.679
of the protest before that time was that

1736.039 --> 1741.44
you could literally block

1738.679 --> 1743.8400000000001
the functioning of something like oh

1741.44 --> 1746.419
everybody's just not going to their job

1743.84 --> 1749.0
they're boycotting it or something and

1746.419 --> 1752.179
then the company manager that was just

1749.0 --> 1754.159
trying to squirt a little bit more money

1752.179 --> 1756.74
out of it yeah they're like forced like

1754.159 --> 1759.2
oh no I'm losing my business I have to

1756.74 --> 1761.539
give in right but nobody would hear

1759.2 --> 1763.64
about that it would just be done nobody

1761.539 --> 1766.58
would hear about it it's just

1763.64 --> 1769.8990000000001
kind of like doing business internally

1766.58 --> 1774.34
but because of the television suddenly

1769.899 --> 1776.32
protesting could be like a whole

1774.34 --> 1779.9599999999998
spiritual

1776.32 --> 1782.0
emotional cultural revolution thing

1779.96 --> 1784.159
where it's like yeah the man's always

1782.0 --> 1787.899
trying to get to us and we just have to

1784.159 --> 1791.72
fight it just like laborers

1787.899 --> 1794.4189999999999
protests their manager

1791.72 --> 1796.82
and then break them and make things as

1794.419 --> 1799.22
they're supposed to be again right

1796.82 --> 1802.1589999999999
that was the idea that's how it's thrown

1799.22 --> 1805.3990000000001
forth as a culture in hippie culture and

1802.159 --> 1807.8600000000001
it was all because of the TV the TV was

1805.399 --> 1810.52
the primary medium suddenly if you're in

1807.86 --> 1812.9599999999998
a protest and you got filmed

1810.52 --> 1814.94
thousands and thousands of people could

1812.96 --> 1819.38
certainly see it and they would know

1814.94 --> 1821.24
about it right it was the ultimate

1819.38 --> 1823.5800000000002
communication tool through the

1821.24 --> 1825.6200000000001
television protesting right

1823.58 --> 1827.0
well

1825.62 --> 1830.299
that

1827.0 --> 1833.24
was 60 years ago

1830.299 --> 1835.82
things have changed a lot since then

1833.24 --> 1840.08
right now

1835.82 --> 1844.52
we have the internet and social media

1840.08 --> 1847.76
and more importantly the television is

1844.52 --> 1850.6
degraded itself to almost a pure

1847.76 --> 1854.6589999999999
propaganda hub

1850.6 --> 1857.539
corporate government political

1854.659 --> 1860.659
propaganda Hub and people that watch

1857.539 --> 1863.059
television which has greatly decreased

1860.659 --> 1865.1000000000001
still a lot though right because more

1863.059 --> 1867.74
people are watching media but

1865.1 --> 1870.86
most of those are now going to the

1867.74 --> 1872.779
internet to their own sources there

1870.86 --> 1875.12
but the television is just so heavily

1872.779 --> 1877.519
propaganda is that it doesn't really

1875.12 --> 1881.0
make a big impact anywhere because like

1877.519 --> 1883.34
seriously involved workers people that

1881.0 --> 1884.899
are very smart are on top of things they

1883.34 --> 1887.6
don't really watch television anymore

1884.899 --> 1889.82
and they shouldn't right because it's

1887.6 --> 1891.32
all [ __ ] you get fed now most of it

1889.82 --> 1893.6589999999999
it's [ __ ]

1891.32 --> 1895.46
so

1893.659 --> 1899.019
protests

1895.46 --> 1899.019
don't work anymore

1899.059 --> 1903.08
you see

1900.919 --> 1906.38
they don't

1903.08 --> 1909.86
they can still work if

1906.38 --> 1912.2
the internet wasn't really censored

1909.86 --> 1913.6999999999998
if there was absolutely no censorship

1912.2 --> 1916.3400000000001
and anything that was on the internet

1913.7 --> 1919.22
could naturally spread

1916.34 --> 1920.84
like completely natural then it would

1919.22 --> 1923.26
work again

1920.84 --> 1926.799
but because of compartmentalization

1923.26 --> 1929.299
really refined censorship techniques

1926.799 --> 1931.6399999999999
narrowing down the gates

1929.299 --> 1934.1
it's become a completely different

1931.64 --> 1936.6200000000001
picture and now every time somebody's

1934.1 --> 1939.559
like protesting and they're like oh look

1936.62 --> 1941.7199999999998
at me look at me I'm I'm filming this

1939.559 --> 1943.22
we're a protest and it's like yeah you

1941.72 --> 1945.799
can communicate that and some people

1943.22 --> 1948.799
will be like um yeah good good there's a

1945.799 --> 1952.4189999999999
good feel right but it doesn't have the

1948.799 --> 1952.4189999999999
effect anymore it used to

1952.519 --> 1956.539
because

1953.84 --> 1958.76
it's like now always preaching to the

1956.539 --> 1961.82
choir because the choir is the only

1958.76 --> 1965.48
group that's still listening

1961.82 --> 1968.72
because it doesn't get on the TV the

1965.48 --> 1972.2
media that used to do that for us

1968.72 --> 1974.059
right the Jews and that's what they were

1972.2 --> 1977.539
and it's what they are and they were

1974.059 --> 1980.72
good for a Time sort of

1977.539 --> 1983.0
they helped the protest work and they

1980.72 --> 1985.279
learned how to wield it and they

1983.0 --> 1987.14
actually eventually tried to turn it

1985.279 --> 1988.7
into a tool for their favor and that's

1987.14 --> 1992.0
how they use it now

1988.7 --> 1994.22
protests are tools in their favor

1992.0 --> 1996.98
because they have the media they have

1994.22 --> 1999.8600000000001
the television they can lay it down how

1996.98 --> 2003.7
it used to be when they need to

1999.86 --> 2005.559
but if you're not part of their plan

2003.7 --> 2007.96
then you can protest and you can video

2005.559 --> 2010.36
it you can say all these things but it's

2007.96 --> 2012.039
only gonna reach the choir that you

2010.36 --> 2013.6589999999999
preach to because you're going to be cut

2012.039 --> 2015.94
off because you're not part of that plan

2013.659 --> 2018.1000000000001
right the protests

2015.94 --> 2022.419
don't work anymore like they used to

2018.1 --> 2024.779
because the media doesn't work like it

2022.419 --> 2024.779
used to

2029.5 --> 2035.019
right protests work over the Internet

2031.38 --> 2037.2990000000002
that's yes they still kind of do but

2035.019 --> 2040.24
it's very different because of

2037.299 --> 2042.58
censorship right the censorship did not

2040.24 --> 2043.96
happen with the TV if something was on

2042.58 --> 2048.6
the TV

2043.96 --> 2048.6
everyone could see it

2048.7 --> 2053.0789999999997
either it would be put on the TV or it

2051.339 --> 2055.2999999999997
would not and if it would not be put

2053.079 --> 2057.52
onto TV there would have been an outrage

2055.3 --> 2058.78
back then right there's like why is this

2057.52 --> 2061.54
being stopped

2058.78 --> 2063.639
who had a real big problem for like the

2061.54 --> 2069.179
media owner and all that

2063.639 --> 2069.179
now censorship happens very easily

2069.94 --> 2073.839
they just sneak it in 30 into that and

2072.399 --> 2075.7
nobody's really paying attention because

2073.839 --> 2078.639
there's millions and millions of

2075.7 --> 2081.5789999999997
different sources to feed from

2078.639 --> 2084.04
and anybody that's now filming a protest

2081.579 --> 2088.139
they're doing usually just ends up

2084.04 --> 2088.139
preaching to their choir

2088.96 --> 2093.46
it's not really having the effect

2090.94 --> 2097.42
anymore it used to because the media

2093.46 --> 2099.64
that made that possible back then Jews

2097.42 --> 2101.56
and they did a good job right they

2099.64 --> 2104.8799999999997
really did and they helped

2101.56 --> 2104.88
they're not helping now

2105.46 --> 2109.0
they're not really helping they're

2107.56 --> 2112.0
playing political games they're not

2109.0 --> 2116.76
helping the public anymore

2112.0 --> 2116.76
so it doesn't work like it used to

2117.64 --> 2124.66
and so any really big organized protest

2121.78 --> 2125.8
especially with like a huge media

2124.66 --> 2128.2599999999998
coverage

2125.8 --> 2130.599
with all the tropes

2128.26 --> 2132.94
especially if it has a lot of tropes is

2130.599 --> 2136.1800000000003
immediately suspicious and it should be

2132.94 --> 2139.119
immediately suspicious to anybody

2136.18 --> 2141.04
like the whole situation in Canada

2139.119 --> 2143.2000000000003
trucker protest didn't own Benjamins

2141.04 --> 2145.18
covered it and I completely agree and it

2143.2 --> 2147.52
the first time I noticed it was

2145.18 --> 2149.74
immediately like yeah that's cool and

2147.52 --> 2152.44
then actually looking into it it's like

2149.74 --> 2154.9599999999996
this is suspicious

2152.44 --> 2156.46
like they're piling on the tropes way

2154.96 --> 2159.52
too high

2156.46 --> 2161.56
so it's becoming like a

2159.52 --> 2163.359
a feeding trough

2161.56 --> 2167.0789999999997
they're trying to

2163.359 --> 2169.7799999999997
pen knew capital

2167.079 --> 2171.6400000000003
that's what it feels like and yeah

2169.78 --> 2174.76
What's It Gonna achieve like who's

2171.64 --> 2176.5
paying for all the fuel Zone basically

2174.76 --> 2178.5400000000004
explain who's paying paying for that

2176.5 --> 2180.22
what's the result how is this gonna

2178.54 --> 2182.82
resolve the situation how's this gonna

2180.22 --> 2182.8199999999997
dissuade

2182.98 --> 2186.76
the government

2184.24 --> 2189.9599999999996
that's clearly like not giving a [ __ ]

2186.76 --> 2193.2400000000002
anymore like really being like

2189.96 --> 2196.599
gleefully authoritarian

2193.24 --> 2200.16
right Trudeau is a sick

2196.599 --> 2200.1600000000003
psychopath dictator

2201.88 --> 2208.06
I think that like

2205.06 --> 2211.119
even Hitler would look at Trudeau right

2208.06 --> 2213.46
now and be like that guy is disgusting

2211.119 --> 2214.78
like he knows no honor

2213.46 --> 2218.52
he doesn't

2214.78 --> 2218.52
is a real [ __ ] creep

2223.3 --> 2229.119
right

2225.46 --> 2231.76
so yeah What's it gonna do is it just a

2229.119 --> 2234.88
moment of Glee just a little celebration

2231.76 --> 2236.26
and and then what how how did that all

2234.88 --> 2238.06
change

2236.26 --> 2240.099
the situation

2238.06 --> 2243.52
I mean it brought a little bit of like

2240.099 --> 2245.6800000000003
trucker dependency awareness

2243.52 --> 2248.14
right because then now everybody knows

2245.68 --> 2249.8799999999997
like yeah the truckers and Canada is

2248.14 --> 2250.96
really important they keep things going

2249.88 --> 2253.0
they keep

2250.96 --> 2254.7400000000002
the supply is going and without them

2253.0 --> 2257.5
they're all doomed

2254.74 --> 2259.359
yeah we know that now this it was kind

2257.5 --> 2262.18
of public knowledge right that's their

2259.359 --> 2264.22
infrastructure that's how they do things

2262.18 --> 2266.7999999999997
and now everybody knows it for a while

2264.22 --> 2269.2599999999998
I'm like oh so good in all Canada

2266.8 --> 2272.619
but how is this actually solving

2269.26 --> 2275.579
anything how's this Gonna Change

2272.619 --> 2275.579
what's going on

2292.44 --> 2298.839
Chinese corporations bought media out

2296.56 --> 2300.52
right we'll talk about an over

2298.839 --> 2303.64
generalization

2300.52 --> 2306.22
the other Andrew sheesh

2303.64 --> 2310.2
um Chinese corporations didn't buy out

2306.22 --> 2310.2
every media that's ridiculous

2310.599 --> 2315.2200000000003
they got involved oh yeah that's what

2313.3 --> 2318.7200000000003
China would do

2315.22 --> 2318.72
hey use opportunity

2318.94 --> 2323.5
right they they play they they play the

2322.42 --> 2326.44
table

2323.5 --> 2329.26
they get involved they make offers like

2326.44 --> 2331.96
oh if you censor these words or if you

2329.26 --> 2334.48
promote that you'll get a little bonus

2331.96 --> 2337.0
right and then they trick you try to

2334.48 --> 2340.06
keep you in there Etc and you become

2337.0 --> 2345.119
afraid to let go it's all standardized

2340.06 --> 2345.119
tricks they don't buy everything up

2345.76 --> 2350.8590000000004
I mean they might have like in the in a

2348.76 --> 2352.1800000000003
sort of way

2350.859 --> 2355.96
but

2352.18 --> 2357.5789999999997
like people in Hollywood right that I

2355.96 --> 2359.8
would say yeah they they probably

2357.579 --> 2362.38
literally bought up even maybe

2359.8 --> 2364.599
blackmailed on top of that certain

2362.38 --> 2366.82
individuals in Hollywood

2364.599 --> 2369.099
for example because they're really

2366.82 --> 2371.56
pushing that [ __ ]

2369.099 --> 2374.099
and they're like inclined to get

2371.56 --> 2377.98
politically

2374.099 --> 2380.44
involved hassling and

2377.98 --> 2383.22
nagging people about you can't say this

2380.44 --> 2386.5
right that usually means that

2383.22 --> 2388.9599999999996
they have slaves there that they've

2386.5 --> 2391.54
actually just

2388.96 --> 2394.119
that they own certain people there in

2391.54 --> 2396.04
order to be able to manipulate them to

2394.119 --> 2399.099
do that

2396.04 --> 2401.5
right but that's mostly because people

2399.099 --> 2404.7400000000002
do that

2401.5 --> 2406.24
they they went with it they let the

2404.74 --> 2409.0
Chinese

2406.24 --> 2411.5789999999997
government there which is really

2409.0 --> 2414.4
dangerous they let they did business and

2411.579 --> 2418.2400000000002
then they took their money

2414.4 --> 2421.0
if you take huge sums of money

2418.24 --> 2425.2599999999998
from a government then effectively

2421.0 --> 2428.8
karmically they own you it's your stupid

2425.26 --> 2431.8190000000004
fault for doing that is your greed

2428.8 --> 2431.819
that did that

2436.599 --> 2443.619
but yeah I think that the Chinese

2440.74 --> 2445.18
they play a role they get involved they

2443.619 --> 2448.3
have their program they have their

2445.18 --> 2451.359
narrative they they meddle right

2448.3 --> 2456.1600000000003
but in all seriousness that's nothing

2451.359 --> 2459.04
nothing compared to the Jew

2456.16 --> 2462.04
they actually own the media

2459.04 --> 2462.7
and with that I mean like almost all of

2462.04 --> 2466.359
it

2462.7 --> 2468.46
if not just all of it

2466.359 --> 2472.96
and they are a guild

2468.46 --> 2475.42
and they do their thing together

2472.96 --> 2477.76
they have long-term plans long-term

2475.42 --> 2483.3
strategies they own it to say all the

2477.76 --> 2483.3
children bought up the media oh come on

2484.48 --> 2487.96
you're just trying to defend the Jew

2486.28 --> 2490.5400000000004
there

2487.96 --> 2493.06
they say he shouldn't defend a Jew but

2490.54 --> 2495.52
know what you're actually doing you know

2493.06 --> 2500.14
know what is real

2495.52 --> 2502.44
is real huh no what is real this is

2500.14 --> 2502.44
sorry

2509.8 --> 2517.8
and the banks right the banks yeah

2513.94 --> 2517.8
that's pretty much the same thing

2524.619 --> 2531.06
and hey if you're Jewish don't worry

2531.4 --> 2535.3
is yeah I just want to State the facts

2534.28 --> 2538.9
right

2535.3 --> 2540.819
Jews own the media they do that's not

2538.9 --> 2542.5
like they're hiding it's like oh I'm not

2540.819 --> 2544.119
you not really no no they're like yeah

2542.5 --> 2548.079
I'm at you

2544.119 --> 2550.839
yeah they are it's what it is

2548.079 --> 2553.0
I'm not even saying it's bad I'm just

2550.839 --> 2555.54
saying you should realize the

2553.0 --> 2555.54
implications

2557.2 --> 2563.4399999999996
do you think any media is truly free

2560.44 --> 2563.44
no

2594.52 --> 2597.06
right

2597.16 --> 2601.42
but it's also extremely difficult even

2600.099 --> 2605.56
at this point

2601.42 --> 2607.2400000000002
to become a truly separate media from

2605.56 --> 2608.92
the Jew

2607.24 --> 2611.9799999999996
because

2608.92 --> 2616.48
they immediately they don't want that

2611.98 --> 2619.3
the Jews want to own all media they do

2616.48 --> 2621.94
it's a conspiracy yeah and it's true

2619.3 --> 2625.3590000000004
it's a true conspiracy the Jew wants to

2621.94 --> 2628.359
own all media all of it everywhere all

2625.359 --> 2630.46
of it at all time

2628.359 --> 2634.24
they see it almost like they're right

2630.46 --> 2635.68
that's what they do it's theirs their

2634.24 --> 2639.52
guilt

2635.68 --> 2641.7999999999997
Jews want to be the Guild of media

2639.52 --> 2644.38
that's what they want and so if you're

2641.8 --> 2647.92
actually completely Grassroots gonna

2644.38 --> 2651.099
compete and gonna not adapt to what they

2647.92 --> 2652.66
do they will just start irrationally

2651.099 --> 2655.26
attacking you

2652.66 --> 2659.6189999999997
blocking you blocking your financial

2655.26 --> 2662.92
sources blocking information

2659.619 --> 2665.56
they'll just cut you off

2662.92 --> 2667.54
and if necessary start slandering you

2665.56 --> 2670.74
calling you anti-semitic or something

2667.54 --> 2673.359
whatever they can slander you with right

2670.74 --> 2677.3799999999997
that's also a problem that's why there's

2673.359 --> 2679.9
no non-jew own media anymore

2677.38 --> 2682.1400000000003
because the Jews just don't let you have

2679.9 --> 2682.14
it

2685.18 --> 2688.02
it's true

2690.76 --> 2695.1400000000003
look in the mirror and and tell yourself

2693.52 --> 2698.859
no

2695.14 --> 2701.04
we let non-jews have their own media

2698.859 --> 2701.04
Empire

2702.88 --> 2708.94
you can't do it

2704.8 --> 2712.2400000000002
because you know that's not true

2708.94 --> 2716.94
you don't want non-jews to have media

2712.24 --> 2716.9399999999996
Empires you don't you know that's true

2733.78 --> 2738.28
because they lose

2735.54 --> 2740.02
their precious pornography

2738.28 --> 2741.6400000000003
yeah that too

2740.02 --> 2745.42
right

2741.64 --> 2748.72
there's a lot of plan there dude it's a

2745.42 --> 2751.06
giant conspiracy and it is what it is

2748.72 --> 2753.0989999999997
they have their directives they have

2751.06 --> 2755.92
their plans they have their

2753.099 --> 2759.04
feeding pits

2755.92 --> 2761.46
if their seduction systems yeah porn is

2759.04 --> 2761.46
one of them

2762.339 --> 2766.02
and they don't want competition

2768.16 --> 2773.0989999999997
they are a guild

2770.14 --> 2776.319
The Guild of media

2773.099 --> 2778.7200000000003
Jews are a guild of media

2776.319 --> 2781.2
not saying like everybody that actually

2778.72 --> 2783.819
is like into the religion or every

2781.2 --> 2786.7599999999998
Hasidic Jew or something is all

2783.819 --> 2789.2799999999997
automatically into media right

2786.76 --> 2793.119
or automatically a banker

2789.28 --> 2795.76
but they will very likely if they have

2793.119 --> 2797.619
ambition grow into doing that at some

2795.76 --> 2800.619
point

2797.619 --> 2803.56
or they'll stay more modest and more

2800.619 --> 2807.4
actually Godly

2803.56 --> 2810.48
focus more on internal wisdom and then

2807.4 --> 2810.48
not do that

2815.079 --> 2819.819
we are not talking about the normal

2817.18 --> 2823.06
Jewel that's right

2819.819 --> 2825.579
somebody that is of the Jewish faith

2823.06 --> 2828.52
that story studies the Torah and maybe

2825.579 --> 2831.4
even all saw the talmud

2828.52 --> 2832.599
doesn't automatically become a mega

2831.4 --> 2835.839
Grappler

2832.599 --> 2838.3590000000004
but they will very likely be seduced

2835.839 --> 2840.7
into becoming that

2838.359 --> 2844.859
they will be tested like you want to be

2840.7 --> 2844.859
a Grappler this is how you do it

2845.38 --> 2849.6400000000003
just realize if you're too good we're

2847.18 --> 2851.6189999999997
gonna come after you

2849.64 --> 2854.44
we're gonna try to Blackmail you you'll

2851.619 --> 2856.059
just get yeah you start tumbling down

2854.44 --> 2858.579
the pit

2856.059 --> 2859.78
right if you go for that if you are

2858.579 --> 2861.88
seduced

2859.78 --> 2864.4
as you worry you

2861.88 --> 2867.099
you learn everything and then yeah you

2864.4 --> 2869.94
become seduced to become a Grappler

2867.099 --> 2869.94
it happens

2869.98 --> 2876.22
unless like there is a like a strong Jew

2873.52 --> 2879.22
family tradition to absolutely protect

2876.22 --> 2882.4199999999996
your your family against that to be like

2879.22 --> 2882.4199999999996
a super moral Jew

2883.599 --> 2887.5
I don't know if that exists actually

2885.16 --> 2891.8799999999997
maybe I made that up

2887.5 --> 2894.64
maybe that's how I thought it I was

2891.88 --> 2896.02
I've had a time where I thought like no

2894.64 --> 2900.2999999999997
I'm a Jew

2896.02 --> 2900.3
I'm just not that sort of you

2900.7 --> 2907.2599999999998
but yeah that's not really relevant

2904.359 --> 2907.2599999999998
really so

2909.94 --> 2916.14
there's a lot about Jewish people that I

2913.119 --> 2920.1400000000003
find very interesting and inspiring and

2916.14 --> 2923.0789999999997
resourceful and creative and so I I do

2920.14 --> 2926.8799999999997
not just hate Jews

2923.079 --> 2926.88
I've met quite a few that were

2927.099 --> 2931.38
a challenge

2928.66 --> 2935.6189999999997
but still

2931.38 --> 2939.28
great to have around to learn from to

2935.619 --> 2941.5
learn life lessons from not even like by

2939.28 --> 2944.26
listening to them but just by dealing

2941.5 --> 2947.88
with them and how they are

2944.26 --> 2947.88
was very teaching

2949.18 --> 2953.94
and they're really inside not all that

2951.7 --> 2953.9399999999996
bad

2954.76 --> 2961.119
it's just that yeah a lot of them did

2957.94 --> 2963.9
get seduced and then they corrupt right

2961.119 --> 2963.9
under your nose

2964.18 --> 2968.7
I've seen it happen

2966.04 --> 2968.7
seen

2969.16 --> 2973.66
guys that were just like really

2971.38 --> 2976.1800000000003
enthusiastic good willing natural

2973.66 --> 2977.2599999999998
functioning like with natural spiritual

2976.18 --> 2981.7
energy

2977.26 --> 2983.7400000000002
be turned into literal

2981.7 --> 2986.5
monsters

2983.74 --> 2989.7999999999997
like that new no mercy that had no more

2986.5 --> 2993.16
grace had no more Spirit like like it

2989.8 --> 2996.579
was destroyed and I've seen

2993.16 --> 2999.94
them do that to each other

2996.579 --> 3004.3390000000004
it's creepy I don't know if that's yeah

2999.94 --> 3004.339
it's all very remote I've never yeah

3004.619 --> 3010.559
I paid a lot of attention to the people

3006.78 --> 3013.5
that I faced in my life

3010.559 --> 3015.059
and it was very fascinated by Jews every

3013.5 --> 3017.52
time

3015.059 --> 3020.28
and especially when I was much younger I

3017.52 --> 3022.319
was always there kind of to protect them

3020.28 --> 3024.0
and then I noticed that every time I

3022.319 --> 3028.2599999999998
protected them they would always have

3024.0 --> 3031.619
response like oh now I have to trick you

3028.26 --> 3033.9
and that was always very weird

3031.619 --> 3035.76
because they were like you're helping me

3033.9 --> 3037.619
because you want some favor from me

3035.76 --> 3039.119
don't you

3037.619 --> 3042.3
uh

3039.119 --> 3043.38
not really maybe if you want to give

3042.3 --> 3045.9
that

3043.38 --> 3049.579
but that's just like I thought you

3045.9 --> 3049.579
needed protection and help

3050.85 --> 3055.6189999999997
[Laughter]

3052.619 --> 3057.7200000000003
they would always be like that

3055.619 --> 3060.44
in retrospective was all kind of

3057.72 --> 3060.4399999999996
hilarious

3061.619 --> 3068.1600000000003
what's the last time you talked with you

3065.579 --> 3070.2000000000003
that's been a while

3068.16 --> 3072.0
then again I might have been talking to

3070.2 --> 3074.48
Jews not even realize that they were

3072.0 --> 3074.48
Jews

3082.2 --> 3089.22
but then again like maybe there are some

3085.559 --> 3093.26
Jews maybe that finds me just on a more

3089.22 --> 3093.2599999999998
personal level really offensive

3094.2 --> 3097.0989999999997
I don't know

3097.2 --> 3103.2799999999997
throughout my life I have just

3100.68 --> 3106.74
four reasons that kind of elude me

3103.28 --> 3109.559
robbed certain people really badly

3106.74 --> 3112.5
without doing anything it just

3109.559 --> 3114.78
I hit them in the completely wrong way

3112.5 --> 3117.0
and then they're just like I hate you I

3114.78 --> 3119.599
hate you I can't stand you and I don't

3117.0 --> 3119.599
know why

3125.28 --> 3131.0400000000004
maybe it's because I I just throw that

3128.819 --> 3133.98
freaking bowling ball right through the

3131.04 --> 3138.18
the glass window in the porcelain shop I

3133.98 --> 3140.52
just do it I just do it

3138.18 --> 3144.859
like I know there's risk I know I'm

3140.52 --> 3144.859
offending people and I just do it

3146.04 --> 3151.079
I'm like I have to do that

3148.5 --> 3153.599
I'm just gonna make sure that I don't

3151.079 --> 3155.46
actually hit anybody with the bowling

3153.599 --> 3158.04
ball that's walking inside of the

3155.46 --> 3161.28
porcelain shop but they're gonna be

3158.04 --> 3163.92
sitting in a giant cacophony

3161.28 --> 3165.8390000000004
of breaking glass and Porcelain and

3163.92 --> 3167.52
that's gonna wake him up and I have to

3165.839 --> 3169.619
do it but I'm gonna make sure that to

3167.52 --> 3172.319
not to wound anybody

3169.619 --> 3174.1800000000003
that's what I do metaphorically I've

3172.319 --> 3175.859
never actually thrown a bowling ball

3174.18 --> 3179.5989999999997
through a glass window in a porcelain

3175.859 --> 3183.14
shop and I never intend to do that

3179.599 --> 3183.1400000000003
just for the record

3184.559 --> 3186.559
um

3188.7 --> 3193.74
but yeah I don't censor and if I know oh

3192.0 --> 3195.96
this is a group they have certain

3193.74 --> 3197.5789999999997
standard issues the first thing I will

3195.96 --> 3199.5
want to do not that I always

3197.579 --> 3201.2400000000002
automatically do it sometimes I just

3199.5 --> 3203.339
bite my tongue and I just don't say

3201.24 --> 3204.66
anything for a very long time it's kind

3203.339 --> 3206.7
of awkward even

3204.66 --> 3209.16
if I feel the opportunity I'm always

3206.7 --> 3212.2799999999997
going to confront somebody

3209.16 --> 3216.66
with the issues

3212.28 --> 3218.3390000000004
that their Associated group that they

3216.66 --> 3220.92
would have to personally associate with

3218.339 --> 3223.2599999999998
I don't just randomly think like oh you

3220.92 --> 3225.3
must be this kind of type I'm just going

3223.26 --> 3228.96
to assume that and confront you with

3225.3 --> 3231.059
problems that that assumed group has no

3228.96 --> 3235.64
I would have to like feel it off you

3231.059 --> 3235.6400000000003
feel that like this person feels like

3235.94 --> 3242.88
she or he belongs to this or that and

3239.76 --> 3246.2400000000002
then I confront the issues with that

3242.88 --> 3247.02
thing they associate with any always do

3246.24 --> 3250.7999999999997
that

3247.02 --> 3252.839
why I do it for their benefit because

3250.8 --> 3255.54
nobody wants to do that

3252.839 --> 3258.119
it's always a sensitive thing to do that

3255.54 --> 3260.4
I kind of have to do that

3258.119 --> 3262.5
because it's like a unique opportunity

3260.4 --> 3264.54
for them to be confronted with something

3262.5 --> 3266.22
that's really important to be confronted

3264.54 --> 3269.7799999999997
with and that nobody wants to confront

3266.22 --> 3269.7799999999997
them with you see

3270.359 --> 3275.0589999999997
because it's a real it's kind of a

3272.22 --> 3275.0589999999997
cultural problem

3275.119 --> 3281.1600000000003
that most people

3277.38 --> 3283.1600000000003
don't confront others

3281.16 --> 3287.46
when they see

3283.16 --> 3289.2
problems with what they act like they

3287.46 --> 3291.059
just leave them

3289.2 --> 3293.0989999999997
leave them rambling out they don't say

3291.059 --> 3294.78
this is wrong or you're making a mistake

3293.099 --> 3298.079
this and this is why

3294.78 --> 3301.38
people just tend to not do that anymore

3298.079 --> 3305.04
that's a big problem it becomes

3301.38 --> 3308.339
social isolation in the middle of groups

3305.04 --> 3310.38
like you're being there you have issues

3308.339 --> 3312.839
you don't know how to confront the

3310.38 --> 3314.46
issues nobody confronts you with those

3312.839 --> 3317.2799999999997
issues

3314.46 --> 3320.52
and that's a problem that's

3317.28 --> 3322.619
systemic it's getting worse

3320.52 --> 3324.18
it's like social isolation in the middle

3322.619 --> 3326.52
of groups

3324.18 --> 3329.46
can't communicate anymore

3326.52 --> 3332.28
so that's what I do

3329.46 --> 3335.94
I basically chisel on people's identity

3332.28 --> 3337.1400000000003
and make them realize what they're part

3335.94 --> 3339.0
of

3337.14 --> 3341.52
in the hopes that they might actually

3339.0 --> 3344.4
overcome those obstacles and through

3341.52 --> 3347.819
that overcoming of obstacles

3344.4 --> 3350.599
help the entire frequency of what they

3347.819 --> 3350.599
associate with

3358.799 --> 3363.9
all right so yeah today I'm inspired you

3362.579 --> 3366.7200000000003
could say

3363.9 --> 3369.599
it's the Sun

3366.72 --> 3371.3999999999996
and it was a bit of Owen Benjamin that's

3369.599 --> 3376.2200000000003
also addressing this

3371.4 --> 3376.2200000000003
I'm just addressing it more

3376.319 --> 3382.099
a little bit of Sharper Edge and more

3378.48 --> 3382.099
specific more Surgical

3382.5 --> 3386.579
own Benjamin is talking about in general

3384.48 --> 3389.339
it's really good that he does because

3386.579 --> 3391.92
this is our systemic problems that the

3389.339 --> 3394.2799999999997
entire world deals with

3391.92 --> 3399.1800000000003
during this

3394.28 --> 3403.799
continuing media developed

3399.18 --> 3407.22
revolutions like the way things change

3403.799 --> 3409.559
keeps changing keeps drifting

3407.22 --> 3412.4399999999996
like it's not going to be the same like

3409.559 --> 3414.1800000000003
10 years ago and in 10 years it's not

3412.44 --> 3415.38
going to be the same like it is right

3414.18 --> 3418.2599999999998
now

3415.38 --> 3421.26
and there's a that shift

3418.26 --> 3423.3590000000004
is predictable

3421.26 --> 3427.2000000000003
part of looking into the future is

3423.359 --> 3431.0989999999997
understanding how things will change and

3427.2 --> 3434.7599999999998
why and how that will change people

3431.099 --> 3438.299
if you see that if you understand that

3434.76 --> 3440.48
then you can effectively plan for the

3438.299 --> 3440.48
future

3441.48 --> 3446.599
and this is also what a lot of people

3443.28 --> 3446.599
that are good at business do

3447.24 --> 3453.66
see how things are going to change and

3450.059 --> 3457.2000000000003
then they try to build towards

3453.66 --> 3460.8799999999997
or something that resolves what is going

3457.2 --> 3460.8799999999997
to be a situation in the future

3461.339 --> 3464.7599999999998
guess who's really good at that by the

3463.2 --> 3467.5989999999997
way in general

3464.76 --> 3467.599
Jews

3468.0 --> 3472.2
that's why yeah because they're really

3469.98 --> 3475.44
good at that

3472.2 --> 3477.0589999999997
that's why they always just end up on

3475.44 --> 3479.339
top

3477.059 --> 3482.6400000000003
and their Guild formation their Guild

3479.339 --> 3485.04
system helps a lot but the in general

3482.64 --> 3486.9
yeah they're very good at that

3485.04 --> 3488.339
figuring out how things are going to

3486.9 --> 3490.26
change and then playing into that

3488.339 --> 3492.7799999999997
anticipating it

3490.26 --> 3496.7000000000003
building towards the solution that's

3492.78 --> 3496.7000000000003
going to be required in the future

3503.16 --> 3507.0
what am I like in the real world face to

3505.26 --> 3512.94
face

3507.0 --> 3516.96
you get shouty angry opinion Jesus Lydia

3512.94 --> 3521.579
dropping some logs there aren't you

3516.96 --> 3525.359
right on my face to face the same

3521.579 --> 3526.8590000000004
and very polite

3525.359 --> 3528.96
Gallant

3526.859 --> 3530.7599999999998
you could say

3528.96 --> 3534.38
and

3530.76 --> 3537.7200000000003
yeah I try to do good with every action

3534.38 --> 3540.7200000000003
including like giving looks

3537.72 --> 3543.299
giving looks giving Smiles it's old Duty

3540.72 --> 3544.799
I'm it's my duty

3543.299 --> 3547.559
to do right

3544.799 --> 3551.16
every action doesn't mean that I have to

3547.559 --> 3553.92
arrange my entire life around achieving

3551.16 --> 3556.5589999999997
to do good things I just do what I do

3553.92 --> 3561.619
but whatever I am doing while I'm doing

3556.559 --> 3561.619
it I have to do right it's my duty

3564.359 --> 3570.54
like even simple things just

3567.839 --> 3572.7599999999998
you're walking somewhere you have

3570.54 --> 3575.94
somebody's walking on the same path in

3572.76 --> 3578.4
the opposite direction you say hello and

3575.94 --> 3581.339
you give them a good look

3578.4 --> 3584.2200000000003
and give them a very little bit of

3581.339 --> 3587.4
energy courtesy

3584.22 --> 3591.66
just say hello and say it well say it

3587.4 --> 3593.2200000000003
not say not an interest no connection to

3591.66 --> 3595.859
make that connection

3593.22 --> 3598.3799999999997
to be good that's what I do that's what

3595.859 --> 3601.74
I always do

3598.38 --> 3605.099
yeah but if somebody breaks open a can

3601.74 --> 3607.799
of Arwin right if you get me growling

3605.099 --> 3609.96
about a subject I will be like this and

3607.799 --> 3613.559
well not extremely like that but I will

3609.96 --> 3616.859
often get very Vivid to express like how

3613.559 --> 3619.26
much outrage there is from me or another

3616.859 --> 3622.02
group about something and I'll be very

3619.26 --> 3624.2990000000004
expressive as I usually am I am like

3622.02 --> 3627.359
that face to face

3624.299 --> 3628.44
because I am very expressive once I get

3627.359 --> 3630.96
going

3628.44 --> 3631.98
and I'm like that to anybody

3630.96 --> 3635.88
but

3631.98 --> 3637.319
if I size up people not to handle that

3635.88 --> 3639.299
all too well if they're like over

3637.319 --> 3641.88
sensitive or they get scared if somebody

3639.299 --> 3643.92
gets too Vivid or too loud

3641.88 --> 3646.799
I'm just not gonna do that I'll just

3643.92 --> 3648.359
like no I'm okay I'm just gonna spare

3646.799 --> 3650.28
you

3648.359 --> 3652.38
but yeah at the same time there's people

3650.28 --> 3654.2400000000002
that are actually like longing for that

3652.38 --> 3656.6600000000003
because

3654.24 --> 3659.819
they want

3656.66 --> 3662.5789999999997
expressiveness they want the feelings

3659.819 --> 3665.339
and so when I then break open a can of

3662.579 --> 3667.1400000000003
Arwen they're like oh yeah

3665.339 --> 3669.9
and yeah in a way

3667.14 --> 3672.92
so my roommate she really likes it when

3669.9 --> 3672.92
I am the way I am

3678.38 --> 3684.859
Robert digital you [ __ ] wanker

3681.42 --> 3684.859
getting a timeout

3685.44 --> 3692.2200000000003
firm believe you're using others no yeah

3689.16 --> 3695.16
do you see the irony yeah yeah but you

3692.22 --> 3699.839
see gamma pieces of [ __ ]

3695.16 --> 3702.72
like yourself yeah you never say the

3699.839 --> 3705.0
[ __ ] that you do in the shitty way you

3702.72 --> 3707.0989999999997
do face to face

3705.0 --> 3709.14
people like you only do that on the

3707.099 --> 3711.48
internet because you know if you do that

3709.14 --> 3712.98
face to face you're gonna run into

3711.48 --> 3715.14
trouble

3712.98 --> 3717.78
yeah some people might tolerate that

3715.14 --> 3718.799
from you at first until you bump into

3717.78 --> 3721.799
one

3718.799 --> 3725.16
size it up wrong and then they don't

3721.799 --> 3728.96
tolerate that you do that and then they

3725.16 --> 3728.96
punch you in the [ __ ] face

3729.42 --> 3733.92
or they just like stick out a foot and

3732.72 --> 3736.98
make you

3733.92 --> 3739.079
tackle it make you fall over

3736.98 --> 3741.059
they're like gonna just [ __ ] with you

3739.079 --> 3743.46
because you're a piece of [ __ ] and you

3741.059 --> 3745.38
behave like a piece of [ __ ]

3743.46 --> 3747.66
you understand

3745.38 --> 3750.9
now I've never actually had to

3747.66 --> 3752.5789999999997
physically do anything to anybody

3750.9 --> 3756.48
out there

3752.579 --> 3761.52
because Gammas don't act like you do in

3756.48 --> 3765.9
my chat to my face they don't do that

3761.52 --> 3767.64
am I skilled in Asian martial arts

3765.9 --> 3770.2200000000003
meh

3767.64 --> 3772.5
I've had some training but I'm I'm kind

3770.22 --> 3775.0789999999997
of stiff these days so

3772.5 --> 3777.72
I'm not as good as I used to be

3775.079 --> 3782.059
but yes I've had I've had a considerable

3777.72 --> 3782.0589999999997
amount of years doing Taekwondo

3785.88 --> 3790.4
right

3787.26 --> 3790.4
I really like that

3791.339 --> 3796.619
how am I skilled

3793.619 --> 3799.02
not not really anymore I would have to

3796.619 --> 3801.7200000000003
train I would have to like learn how to

3799.02 --> 3804.0
handle physical pain again

3801.72 --> 3806.7599999999998
because I'm not very good at that I'd

3804.0 --> 3809.16
like have to regularly like take punches

3806.76 --> 3811.92
on the arm hurt

3809.16 --> 3815.2799999999997
in order to like learn to ignore that

3811.92 --> 3817.799
again that took some training

3815.28 --> 3819.6600000000003
because I don't like physical pain I'm

3817.799 --> 3821.579
very sensitive with everything and then

3819.66 --> 3823.98
includes to that

3821.579 --> 3825.9
doesn't mean that I can't handle it if I

3823.98 --> 3827.76
need to if I know like if I'm going to

3825.9 --> 3829.6800000000003
complain now I'm gonna get in real

3827.76 --> 3832.0200000000004
trouble then I could literally have

3829.68 --> 3834.839
somebody hit me right in the face and

3832.02 --> 3837.72
not flinch even though it hurts

3834.839 --> 3838.859
I can do that it's actually happened to

3837.72 --> 3841.799
me one time

3838.859 --> 3844.859
some drunk kid

3841.799 --> 3846.96
during New Year's Eve just try to rob me

3844.859 --> 3849.119
off my fireworks and it was like now let

3846.96 --> 3851.28
[ __ ] go and then he punched me in the

3849.119 --> 3854.7200000000003
face and I was like

3851.28 --> 3854.7200000000003
why don't you try that again

3855.0 --> 3858.839
but yeah of course he was gonna [ __ ] his

3857.16 --> 3861.0589999999997
pants after realizing what he just done

3858.839 --> 3864.66
and then he ran away

3861.059 --> 3868.94
and I got to keep most of my fireworks

3864.66 --> 3868.94
right but afterward that really hurt

3868.98 --> 3874.7400000000002
scale that Chuck Norris roundhouse kick

3871.92 --> 3880.319
yeah I was actually really good at that

3874.74 --> 3883.5589999999997
I I did the maneuver and that's now

3880.319 --> 3885.9
God 20 years ago

3883.559 --> 3887.88
a long time ago

3885.9 --> 3889.799
more than 20 years ago damn I'm getting

3887.88 --> 3892.6800000000003
old

3889.799 --> 3894.839
I was I did a maneuver and I even did it

3892.68 --> 3898.5589999999997
during an exam

3894.839 --> 3900.9
a Taekwondo exam where I did a backward

3898.559 --> 3903.0
spin double kick

3900.9 --> 3905.64
and that's not even an officially

3903.0 --> 3908.359
registered maneuver and I did it and I

3905.64 --> 3908.359
did it perfectly

3911.28 --> 3917.099
that's right

3913.079 --> 3920.76
backward spin double kick yeah that's

3917.099 --> 3923.7200000000003
right I was a regular Chun Li

3920.76 --> 3923.7200000000003
male guy

3936.119 --> 3941.099
right but yeah I have a really good

3938.819 --> 3943.74
sense of balance I always have I've

3941.099 --> 3945.96
trained it a lot

3943.74 --> 3949.3799999999997
that's very handy by the way because

3945.96 --> 3952.92
anytime I drop anything glasses

3949.38 --> 3956.28
I always I've never broken a thing in a

3952.92 --> 3959.839
long long time as in

3956.28 --> 3962.94
25 years like I never break a glass

3959.839 --> 3965.4
never happens if it's broken it's always

3962.94 --> 3968.28
because somebody else broke it every

3965.4 --> 3972.119
single time now

3968.28 --> 3973.559
because I always catch it always always

3972.119 --> 3975.6600000000003
catch it

3973.559 --> 3977.46
if I can't catch it with my hand right

3975.66 --> 3979.5
as it's falling I'll catch it with my

3977.46 --> 3981.859
foot and I'll make sure that it doesn't

3979.5 --> 3981.859
break

3982.559 --> 3990.6800000000003
because I got really good balance and

3985.26 --> 3990.6800000000003
extremely fast reflexes extremely fast

3994.2 --> 3998.7
and that's not growing slower either

3996.42 --> 4001.2200000000003
it's not getting slower my reflexes are

3998.7 --> 4004.72
like super fast and they will probably

4001.22 --> 4004.72
always be super fast

4011.24 --> 4017.8999999999996
huh Fluttershy are you going for Kung Fu

4015.02 --> 4021.44
right well yeah good for what well I did

4017.9 --> 4022.819
it not because I wanted to learn how to

4021.44 --> 4025.2200000000003
fight even

4022.819 --> 4028.7
I did it mostly for physical exercise

4025.22 --> 4030.68
and balance and

4028.7 --> 4033.819
I've always kind of treated it like an

4030.68 --> 4033.819
alternative to dancing

4036.079 --> 4040.94
I never really liked even the sparring

4038.24 --> 4041.9599999999996
part I mean I did it but I never liked

4040.94 --> 4045.559
it

4041.96 --> 4047.7200000000003
because I don't like getting hit

4045.559 --> 4051.38
and I think yeah Kung Fu would probably

4047.72 --> 4055.0389999999998
be more effective as a fighting

4051.38 --> 4058.46
thing for actual combat

4055.039 --> 4060.44
but that's not really what I did it for

4058.46 --> 4062.5
I learned Taekwondo mostly for

4060.44 --> 4066.079
self-defense in the sense

4062.5 --> 4070.42
perfecting my reflexes and balance in

4066.079 --> 4070.42
order to avoid every blow

4071.299 --> 4075.14
that's kind of what I trained on even

4073.16 --> 4078.2599999999998
though that's not what Taekwondo really

4075.14 --> 4082.299
is about necessarily

4078.26 --> 4082.2990000000004
but that's what I got out of it mostly

4086.839 --> 4093.859
but I will never be a one-on-one martial

4090.799 --> 4096.98
art fighter

4093.859 --> 4099.46
I never will I don't want to you see I

4096.98 --> 4099.459999999999
don't want to

4099.92 --> 4103.839
I'm much more interested in

4104.54 --> 4111.259
in spiritual power and social energy

4109.46 --> 4114.799
and

4111.259 --> 4116.839
learning how to basically Force somebody

4114.799 --> 4119.96
to stand down without

4116.839 --> 4121.5199999999995
laying as much as a finger on them

4119.96 --> 4124.819
how do you do that how do you

4121.52 --> 4126.679
communicate how do you instantly Force

4124.819 --> 4128.54
somebody to realize that they're doing

4126.679 --> 4130.6990000000005
something that they don't need to do and

4128.54 --> 4132.319
that they will end up regretting how do

4130.699 --> 4134.839
you do that

4132.319 --> 4137.2390000000005
I can't even explain how that works I

4134.839 --> 4139.2789999999995
just do it it's that is something I

4137.239 --> 4141.919999999999
train on

4139.279 --> 4143.900000000001
right so I walk on the street and like a

4141.92 --> 4146.659
group of

4143.9 --> 4149.599999999999
let's just say like doobie is looking

4146.659 --> 4151.639999999999
black guys and yeah some of them do look

4149.6 --> 4153.7390000000005
boobies not that they roll like that

4151.64 --> 4154.819
right but some of them they kind of are

4153.739 --> 4157.4
like that

4154.819 --> 4158.6
I will just walk right past right

4157.4 --> 4160.94
through it

4158.6 --> 4162.1990000000005
and not be afraid I'll look them right

4160.94 --> 4164.3589999999995
in the eye

4162.199 --> 4166.339
and don't do nothing even though they

4164.359 --> 4169.58
kind of in their mind and I can see it

4166.339 --> 4171.5
we're eager to to kind of like start

4169.58 --> 4172.94
trouble or they're not gonna start

4171.5 --> 4176.54
trouble with me

4172.94 --> 4179.54
because I know how this works

4176.54 --> 4181.699
nobody starts trouble with me they don't

4179.54 --> 4185.319
because they don't want to because I

4181.699 --> 4185.3189999999995
make them not want to

4188.179 --> 4193.1
right and I know that gamma's especially

4191.12 --> 4195.199
now that I've said that are always going

4193.1 --> 4197.659000000001
to be fantasizing about doing exactly

4195.199 --> 4200.78
that but yeah reality you don't really

4197.659 --> 4203.54
do that do you because you don't deal

4200.78 --> 4204.8
with reality you deal with squirting

4203.54 --> 4208.5199999999995
fantasies

4204.8 --> 4211.1
to substitute reality because you don't

4208.52 --> 4213.320000000001
actually do things in reality

4211.1 --> 4215.900000000001
because most of you Gammas are just

4213.32 --> 4218.719
chronic Cowarts

4215.9 --> 4220.94
that avoid reality and end up spending

4218.719 --> 4224.2390000000005
their time fantasizing about how they

4220.94 --> 4227.54
would do things in an optimal way being

4224.239 --> 4229.759999999999
very cool being the winner and that you

4227.54 --> 4233.32
never actually do

4229.76 --> 4233.320000000001
and that's what Gammas do

4234.62 --> 4238.719
right like Robert digital

4239.9 --> 4245.0
they just blabber they never actually do

4242.9 --> 4247.159
anything

4245.0 --> 4248.179
I was just fantasizing about doing

4247.159 --> 4250.219
things

4248.179 --> 4253.159
get pissed off

4250.219 --> 4255.02
and other people for talking about it or

4253.159 --> 4257.239
actually doing it

4255.02 --> 4260.900000000001
and they never do it themselves because

4257.239 --> 4265.718999999999
they're cowards chronic cowardice

4260.9 --> 4265.719
it's a real problem it's a gamma problem

4267.14 --> 4273.08
inability to confront confront Their

4269.9 --> 4274.4
Fear confront their their selves their

4273.08 --> 4279.94
own worth

4274.4 --> 4279.94
the reality of their situation fear

4279.98 --> 4286.218999999999
so it prevents them from moving on

4282.739 --> 4288.5599999999995
the ridiculous fantasy squirting

4286.219 --> 4290.659
about things that they should just do

4288.56 --> 4293.2390000000005
and then realize it doesn't work like

4290.659 --> 4295.839999999999
that how you fantasized about it they

4293.239 --> 4295.839999999999
don't go there

4311.36 --> 4317.08
you don't need to be your best you just

4313.82 --> 4317.08
have to be able to put up a fight right

4317.78 --> 4322.28
or you have to look like you could

4320.42 --> 4324.92
really hurt them

4322.28 --> 4328.46
no guess what I look like I can really

4324.92 --> 4332.4800000000005
hurt somebody if I needed to I do and I

4328.46 --> 4335.96
can and I have the internal sadism

4332.48 --> 4338.0
I have a very sadistic monster deep deep

4335.96 --> 4340.52
hidden inside of me

4338.0 --> 4342.14
and it never let out

4340.52 --> 4344.900000000001
unless

4342.14 --> 4348.1990000000005
unless somebody's actually set their

4344.9 --> 4351.5
ways on getting me physically and then

4348.199 --> 4353.96
it's no mercy time then it means I'm

4351.5 --> 4355.94
gonna hurt you not even like put you in

4353.96 --> 4358.88
the hospital but I can make you feel

4355.94 --> 4360.98
pain that doesn't go away

4358.88 --> 4364.36
and that's gonna haunt you in your

4360.98 --> 4364.36
dreams I can literally

4365.54 --> 4370.5199999999995
I learned this from somebody I learned

4368.179 --> 4373.58
this actually from a girl that could

4370.52 --> 4376.34
just touch you with a finger

4373.58 --> 4380.08
and it would hurt it would physically

4376.34 --> 4380.08
hurt and it would keep hurting

4380.12 --> 4384.98
I learned how to do that

4382.94 --> 4387.44
I don't like doing it

4384.98 --> 4389.78
but if somebody is actually become

4387.44 --> 4392.9
possessed with the idea that they can

4389.78 --> 4396.139999999999
physically humiliate or hurt me then I

4392.9 --> 4400.12
will unleash that demon temporarily and

4396.14 --> 4400.12
really really hurt you

4401.9 --> 4406.699
and people feel that they feel this is

4405.02 --> 4409.34
dangerous this is like [ __ ] with

4406.699 --> 4413.5
Darth Vader

4409.34 --> 4413.5
they can feel that off me

4425.42 --> 4430.58
immature individuals kind of handle

4427.34 --> 4433.4800000000005
commune yes absolutely Kevlar you guys

4430.58 --> 4433.48
are totally getting it

4434.12 --> 4438.699
but these things I think need to be

4436.219 --> 4438.699
talked about

4439.34 --> 4444.08
because people especially a lot of

4441.5 --> 4444.8
Gammas they just blabber on and blabber

4444.08 --> 4447.86
on

4444.8 --> 4452.0
and they create this false world

4447.86 --> 4455.0
for themselves to be able to avoid

4452.0 --> 4457.46
things they fear and not feel bad about

4455.0 --> 4460.34
it the problem is if so many people do

4457.46 --> 4462.86
that then eventually others that aren't

4460.34 --> 4464.6
like that might actually start to

4462.86 --> 4467.78
believe that's real because everybody

4464.6 --> 4470.659000000001
says it and if you repeat a lie doesn't

4467.78 --> 4475.159
have to be a lie about a thing but just

4470.659 --> 4478.239
a lying Escapist attitude a certain way

4475.159 --> 4481.46
of doing things if you confront somebody

4478.239 --> 4484.4
with a consistent picture

4481.46 --> 4487.88
enough eventually they will start to

4484.4 --> 4490.82
believe it right if you repeat a lie

4487.88 --> 4491.900000000001
enough people will think eventually it

4490.82 --> 4494.84
is true

4491.9 --> 4498.32
it's not just about a lie that's about

4494.84 --> 4501.4400000000005
an entire false attitude it works that

4498.32 --> 4504.62
unfortunately it does and people are

4501.44 --> 4507.739
getting fooled by the illusions that

4504.62 --> 4509.239
gamma's weave for themselves they weave

4507.739 --> 4511.58
it to comfort themselves and other

4509.239 --> 4513.5
people are starting to think

4511.58 --> 4517.1
that that's real

4513.5 --> 4519.02
and it is it's all an illusion

4517.1 --> 4520.6990000000005
it's all an illusion they make for

4519.02 --> 4522.8
themselves

4520.699 --> 4525.32
and a lot of people do it unfortunately

4522.8 --> 4527.719
it's been normalized in ways through

4525.32 --> 4531.88
social media through

4527.719 --> 4531.88
well nobody correcting them

4539.6 --> 4544.2390000000005
amazing show thanks to take care yeah

4541.699 --> 4544.239
you too

4548.48 --> 4553.339999999999
having over to Nate's okay science works

4551.54 --> 4556.58
in mysterious way but there is no flat

4553.34 --> 4559.12
Earth debates live today so I'm gonna

4556.58 --> 4559.12
keep going

4565.159 --> 4570.82
gravity is mass attracting each other no

4581.84 --> 4587.06
we have a hard time with the definition

4584.6 --> 4589.54
of gravity yeah because it's not it

4587.06 --> 4589.54
isn't anything

4590.06 --> 4594.1990000000005
yeah correct not that graphic yeah yeah

4592.34 --> 4597.8
well I'm kind of ready to change

4594.199 --> 4601.178999999999
subjects I think I've discussed this

4597.8 --> 4601.179
a long enough hole

4604.159 --> 4610.339999999999
just got all cold me talking so long

4607.58 --> 4613.36
that my tea actually got cold

4610.34 --> 4613.360000000001
but it's a good thing

4614.0 --> 4617.9
it's better than yesterday and the day

4615.8 --> 4621.1990000000005
before I just

4617.9 --> 4623.299999999999
just sit there not really knowing what

4621.199 --> 4627.799999999999
to say now I got a whole

4623.3 --> 4630.76
a whole thing a whole subject going

4627.8 --> 4630.76
thank you son

4669.38 --> 4671.56
foreign

4675.56 --> 4679.4800000000005
any name suggestions

4683.3 --> 4686.56
I think I should like

4687.02 --> 4691.3
don't want to make it relate to like

4688.58 --> 4691.3
protests

4695.42 --> 4701.38
we should just call it like the history

4697.46 --> 4701.38
and function of protests

4702.62 --> 4708.679
yeah I'm gonna do that make a decent

4705.86 --> 4712.0599999999995
enough title that's where it all started

4708.679 --> 4712.06
subject so

4718.02 --> 4721.369000000001
[Applause]

4737.96 --> 4743.12
although yeah

4739.82 --> 4745.82
should probably even elaborate more

4743.12 --> 4748.239
because there's much more protests are

4745.82 --> 4748.239
outdated

4749.719 --> 4753.7390000000005
yeah but I don't even know if that's

4751.34 --> 4757.88
entirely true it's just that the way

4753.739 --> 4760.94
they're functioning right now it that

4757.88 --> 4763.82
is not what it seems to be but to just

4760.94 --> 4765.919999999999
say they're outdated in general I can't

4763.82 --> 4769.04
say such a thing

4765.92 --> 4772.159
because there might still be another

4769.04 --> 4774.28
angle of approach that it might evolve

4772.159 --> 4774.28
into

4778.4 --> 4783.679
the most important thing is that we

4780.44 --> 4786.678999999999
first understand what it is

4783.679 --> 4790.28
where it came from why it worked so well

4786.679 --> 4792.14
and why it doesn't work as well now

4790.28 --> 4795.259999999999
that's more important than then

4792.14 --> 4796.34
everybody starts to understand what's

4795.26 --> 4798.02
going on

4796.34 --> 4800.84
then

4798.02 --> 4805.719
maybe another form

4800.84 --> 4805.719
can be figured out and adopted

4806.78 --> 4812.12
but the way it's working right now that

4809.719 --> 4814.52
seems It's not what it used to be it's

4812.12 --> 4817.239
just controlled now it's controlled by

4814.52 --> 4817.2390000000005
media

4825.8 --> 4831.46
like protests don't really work if media

4828.739 --> 4831.459999999999
is not free

4833.48 --> 4836.919999999999
maybe I should call it that

4837.639 --> 4844.58
protests don't work if media is not free

4841.76 --> 4846.88
but then again can media be free you

4844.58 --> 4849.5
know because media and maintenance of it

4846.88 --> 4852.1
actually does cost money so it's

4849.5 --> 4852.1
complicated

4857.179 --> 4860.84
let's see yeah it might be a better

4858.62 --> 4863.719
title

4860.84 --> 4867.219
protests don't work

4863.719 --> 4867.219
if media isn't free

4869.0 --> 4870.45
foreign

4869.39 --> 4870.84
[Applause]

4870.45 --> 4873.989
[Music]

4870.84 --> 4873.9890000000005
[Applause]

4887.239 --> 4891.759999999999
yeah I think that would be a more

4888.8 --> 4891.76
appropriate title

4892.219 --> 4895.94
the truth should be free now the truth

4894.38 --> 4900.4400000000005
is free

4895.94 --> 4902.78
media does not equal truth media is a

4900.44 --> 4905.299999999999
medium it's a place where information

4902.78 --> 4907.94
can pass through

4905.3 --> 4911.2390000000005
the media

4907.94 --> 4914.419999999999
can never be for free so it's gonna cost

4911.239 --> 4917.419999999999
like just like you're gonna pay to rent

4914.42 --> 4920.4800000000005
a building right so are you gonna pay to

4917.42 --> 4923.36
rent media

4920.48 --> 4925.339999999999
to have that space to communicate and to

4923.36 --> 4928.88
use to communicate that's gonna cost

4925.34 --> 4931.6
it's never going to be financially free

4928.88 --> 4931.6
but

4932.3 --> 4936.4400000000005
yeah that's not what this Freedom

4934.58 --> 4938.0
specifically in the title is about it's

4936.44 --> 4941.799999999999
about

4938.0 --> 4941.8
basically uncensored

4950.56 --> 4957.38
so it's more about the freedom of the

4953.6 --> 4959.6
information that can pass through

4957.38 --> 4960.5
not the financial

4959.6 --> 4962.179
price

4960.5 --> 4963.8
[Music]

4962.179 --> 4965.54
price tag

4963.8 --> 4967.639
that's not free

4965.54 --> 4969.38
it can't be just like you're not going

4967.639 --> 4971.659000000001
to be able to find buildings out there

4969.38 --> 4975.639
you can rent for free it's always going

4971.659 --> 4975.638999999999
to have to be paid for by something

4988.28 --> 4992.259999999999
soapbox rent is too high

4995.719 --> 4997.9
foreign

5019.26 --> 5025.96
that's an interesting statement

5022.6 --> 5028.719
you have a point it's not complete

5025.96 --> 5031.0
though say somebody has to decide what

5028.719 --> 5033.28
gets covered by in the media media is

5031.0 --> 5034.42
always somebody spin on things

5033.28 --> 5036.4
well

5034.42 --> 5038.92
yes

5036.4 --> 5041.08
but

5038.92 --> 5045.34
if

5041.08 --> 5047.86
others can have their own spin if enough

5045.34 --> 5049.3
people have their own free personal

5047.86 --> 5051.94
opinion

5049.3 --> 5054.400000000001
spin on things and they're not all like

5051.94 --> 5056.5599999999995
drones set in One Direction and that

5054.4 --> 5060.099999999999
they're Oh no you're too outside of the

5056.56 --> 5061.900000000001
box you're not allowed in right as long

5060.1 --> 5063.9400000000005
as that doesn't happen

5061.9 --> 5065.86
and then it doesn't matter if it's

5063.94 --> 5067.9
somebody's spin because if everybody

5065.86 --> 5070.78
spins in all directions

5067.9 --> 5072.159
then there is no uniform spin there's no

5070.78 --> 5074.139
spell

5072.159 --> 5076.42
to indoctrinate

5074.139 --> 5080.08
because everybody gives their own piece

5076.42 --> 5082.12
of information and insight right

5080.08 --> 5083.739
and if they even contrast each other and

5082.12 --> 5085.9
they can debate each other then you

5083.739 --> 5087.4
actually do have

5085.9 --> 5090.159
freedom

5087.4 --> 5093.699
but if it's all just

5090.159 --> 5096.099999999999
Talking Heads saying the same lines over

5093.699 --> 5098.4
and over again yeah then you have a spin

5096.1 --> 5102.400000000001
then you have a super uniform

5098.4 --> 5102.4
indoctrination media

5102.94 --> 5108.699
right but if everybody is free to

5105.82 --> 5109.9
approach whatever is being discussed in

5108.699 --> 5112.0599999999995
their own way

5109.9 --> 5114.219
and then even debate it with other

5112.06 --> 5116.1990000000005
people on that platform that have a

5114.219 --> 5118.06
slightly different opinion

5116.199 --> 5120.04
then

5118.06 --> 5124.320000000001
then it's still good because then

5120.04 --> 5124.32
everybody can learn from it

5127.78 --> 5135.639
right so it's only if there's a uniform

5131.82 --> 5138.4
media Mogul that literally writes the

5135.639 --> 5140.32
script for every news reader

5138.4 --> 5143.44
yeah that's

5140.32 --> 5146.739
that's like uniform

5143.44 --> 5149.379999999999
young Electro media which leads to

5146.739 --> 5151.48
indoctrination pretty much only it's

5149.38 --> 5153.88
more like media for television these

5151.48 --> 5155.44
days this is which is like almost only

5153.88 --> 5157.78
that

5155.44 --> 5159.5199999999995
it's just programming just programming

5157.78 --> 5161.5
somebody reading out a script their

5159.52 --> 5164.1990000000005
script's all been a tune all the scripts

5161.5 --> 5167.5
are all uniformly pushing you in One

5164.199 --> 5169.299999999999
Direction and then it's read by news

5167.5 --> 5171.94
readers

5169.3 --> 5175.360000000001
right that's not really media in General

5171.94 --> 5179.08
Media is just a medium

5175.36 --> 5181.239
it's a place it's a virtual place where

5179.08 --> 5184.12
information can be brought on the table

5181.239 --> 5185.739
and then spread out and there is a Media

5184.12 --> 5187.96
Group

5185.739 --> 5190.599999999999
where everybody can have different

5187.96 --> 5194.08
opinions about something

5190.6 --> 5196.719
and they all have the room uncensored to

5194.08 --> 5199.54
lay down their opinion about it

5196.719 --> 5202.9
whatever comes and they're all different

5199.54 --> 5204.88
and they might Clash or they might go in

5202.9 --> 5208.179
debates with one another then you have

5204.88 --> 5210.159000000001
free media that's free because it's not

5208.179 --> 5212.4400000000005
censored because it's not all forced to

5210.159 --> 5215.699
become uniform

5212.44 --> 5215.699
this very big difference

5219.1 --> 5226.42
right

5221.44 --> 5228.879999999999
it would be classified under independent

5226.42 --> 5230.62
because everybody in it is independent

5228.88 --> 5233.1990000000005
they're all doing their own thing

5230.62 --> 5235.36
they're not being forced to follow

5233.199 --> 5239.32
certain narrative

5235.36 --> 5241.839999999999
they're not being censored top down

5239.32 --> 5246.78
and that is more free that's more free

5241.84 --> 5246.78
of Freedom of Information type of media

5246.82 --> 5251.199
and that's a lot better

5249.28 --> 5253.179
because if there's a lot of top down

5251.199 --> 5254.62
control like this is the script you

5253.179 --> 5256.179
always have to fall in the script these

5254.62 --> 5258.94
are the things you can't talk about we

5256.179 --> 5261.159
know you like to you can't do it then

5258.94 --> 5264.12
there's no Freedom you're just a news

5261.159 --> 5264.12
reader at that point

5290.44 --> 5297.28
yeah I might be yeah look the media in

5293.26 --> 5301.26
in England is terrible

5297.28 --> 5301.259999999999
it's one of the most uniform

5302.88 --> 5308.8
disrespectful to humanity types of media

5305.98 --> 5312.339999999999
setups in the world

5308.8 --> 5315.159000000001
and it's terrible indeed BBC it's

5312.34 --> 5317.08
terrible now and it's such a tragedy

5315.159 --> 5321.5199999999995
because the BBC

5317.08 --> 5325.54
like in the 90s was like the best

5321.52 --> 5328.2390000000005
highest quality media in the world

5325.54 --> 5330.159
they were the best in the world and

5328.239 --> 5332.5
everybody knows it

5330.159 --> 5334.12
the best documentary the best nature

5332.5 --> 5338.26
documentary The

5334.12 --> 5341.139
best quality overall high standard High

5338.26 --> 5344.679
culture standard right almost like a

5341.139 --> 5347.1990000000005
noble feeling to it in a way well

5344.679 --> 5350.9800000000005
whatever happened

5347.199 --> 5354.04
in the new century it's now turned more

5350.98 --> 5355.718999999999
into like a communist propaganda

5354.04 --> 5359.139
Guild

5355.719 --> 5363.36
and they are nothing like they used to

5359.139 --> 5365.139
be nothing they're quite the opposite

5363.36 --> 5367.179
invasive

5365.139 --> 5370.78
stifling

5367.179 --> 5372.219
and just straight out evil

5370.78 --> 5375.099999999999
evil

5372.219 --> 5379.2390000000005
people in the BBC that program it the

5375.1 --> 5380.92
way they do are evil like really really

5379.239 --> 5382.78
evil

5380.92 --> 5384.4
and they probably is not the only

5382.78 --> 5386.679
terrible thing they do

5384.4 --> 5388.96
I bet that a whole bunch of those people

5386.679 --> 5391.12
in there that are doing what that have

5388.96 --> 5394.06
turned the BBC into what it is right now

5391.12 --> 5397.48
are probably involved in some really

5394.06 --> 5401.280000000001
really nasty ass [ __ ]

5397.48 --> 5401.28
you know what I'm talking about

5402.34 --> 5407.9800000000005
so yeah BBC got completely and utterly

5406.0 --> 5411.219
graveled and it is a giant tragedy

5407.98 --> 5415.32
because it used to be like the best

5411.219 --> 5415.32
media quality in the world

5429.04 --> 5434.639
oh

5431.8 --> 5434.639
yeah

5435.219 --> 5441.52
but guys you can look back at

5437.86 --> 5445.0
BBC Nature Documentaries from the 90s

5441.52 --> 5447.219
and they're still great you can watch

5445.0 --> 5448.84
them right now they're on YouTube you

5447.219 --> 5452.58
can find that stuff everywhere now

5448.84 --> 5452.58
because it's very popular

5452.86 --> 5456.099999999999
it's so good

5454.42 --> 5458.139
they were so good

5456.1 --> 5459.820000000001
just taking they're taking it so serious

5458.139 --> 5463.3
every time

5459.82 --> 5466.78
and yeah if you look what the BBC rolls

5463.3 --> 5468.76
out now you have to be careful get a

5466.78 --> 5470.86
bucket because there's a big chance that

5468.76 --> 5473.860000000001
if you watch it longer than 20 seconds

5470.86 --> 5476.0199999999995
you're gonna throw up it's become so

5473.86 --> 5479.199
disgusting

5476.02 --> 5481.0
like everything you hate

5479.199 --> 5484.12
about media

5481.0 --> 5486.58
is pretty much like all gathered and

5484.12 --> 5489.46
concentrated over at the BBC

5486.58 --> 5491.08
it's like pure mind control of the

5489.46 --> 5493.0
darkest sword

5491.08 --> 5495.94
very very evil

5493.0 --> 5500.08
like not respectful of the human being

5495.94 --> 5502.5599999999995
of the human Spirit or of England in the

5500.08 --> 5502.5599999999995
slightest

5505.719 --> 5511.679
yeah that's right David Attenborough

5507.58 --> 5511.679
yeah dude it was a legend

5542.92 --> 5548.92
can you imagine

5545.08 --> 5551.92
that the BBC like let's just role play

5548.92 --> 5554.139
imagine that the BBC would would have

5551.92 --> 5556.36
wouldn't have been infiltrated and

5554.139 --> 5558.52
corrupted by communist revolutionary

5556.36 --> 5561.219
satanists

5558.52 --> 5563.5
and that it would still be the quality

5561.219 --> 5564.52
it was in the 90s

5563.5 --> 5567.82
dude

5564.52 --> 5569.679
England would not be in its position

5567.82 --> 5572.679
that it is

5569.679 --> 5575.4400000000005
can you imagine that if BBC was as good

5572.679 --> 5577.54
in it with as much Integrity as it was

5575.44 --> 5579.699
in the 90s if it wasn't like that right

5577.54 --> 5581.8
now with every [ __ ] that's happened with

5579.699 --> 5583.96
Boris Johnson

5581.8 --> 5587.139
insane

5583.96 --> 5590.08
sea situation dude

5587.139 --> 5592.6
BBC would have been all over that

5590.08 --> 5595.9
it would have raised the morale

5592.6 --> 5597.820000000001
in England to really high standards

5595.9 --> 5601.54
because that's what they used to do

5597.82 --> 5604.36
that's what the BBC was there for

5601.54 --> 5607.42
to show them like we still we're still

5604.36 --> 5609.82
high class we can still do it we can

5607.42 --> 5612.76
still have Peak culture

5609.82 --> 5614.92
we'll take care of it we will figure out

5612.76 --> 5617.38
the unmisunderstandings we will figure

5614.92 --> 5619.719
out the problem they were like that

5617.38 --> 5622.900000000001
that would have been fantastic in this

5619.719 --> 5623.92
age but yeah unfortunately that didn't

5622.9 --> 5627.54
happen

5623.92 --> 5627.54
they corrupted utterly

5634.36 --> 5641.46
what position is England in well England

5636.88 --> 5641.46
is undergoing a Communist Revolution

5641.92 --> 5647.62
in its own right just like America

5644.739 --> 5651.178999999999
and well unfortunately just like a whole

5647.62 --> 5651.179
bunch of other European countries

5651.58 --> 5656.04
but England's gone pretty far with it

5659.13 --> 5662.289
[Music]

5672.639 --> 5678.9400000000005
right but you got to realize also that

5675.58 --> 5680.86
media again media is so powerful now

5678.94 --> 5685.36
because

5680.86 --> 5687.0599999999995
you cannot have a cultural revolution

5685.36 --> 5691.0599999999995
without

5687.06 --> 5693.04
centralized media control

5691.06 --> 5695.92
and this is what this

5693.04 --> 5698.26
Chinese Communists pretty much learned

5695.92 --> 5700.4800000000005
the best

5698.26 --> 5703.119000000001
that's why they do not relinquish it

5700.48 --> 5705.218999999999
because they know they have to keep that

5703.119 --> 5708.94
under control as soon as they lose that

5705.219 --> 5711.54
it's gonna fall apart

5708.94 --> 5715.379999999999
because you can't have

5711.54 --> 5718.0
a cultural revolution without

5715.38 --> 5720.9400000000005
centralized media control

5718.0 --> 5723.34
and I'll bet you because this is

5720.94 --> 5724.299999999999
basically I I just plucked this out of

5723.34 --> 5726.159000000001
the air

5724.3 --> 5729.1
I'll bet you

5726.159 --> 5731.099999999999
that historically what I just said is

5729.1 --> 5733.96
absolutely 100

5731.1 --> 5736.659000000001
historically true

5733.96 --> 5739.179
the media is not under centralized

5736.659 --> 5741.78
control than a cultural revolution just

5739.179 --> 5741.78
doesn't happen

5742.36 --> 5748.42
I mean personal revolutions people

5745.78 --> 5750.099999999999
individuals might evolve they might

5748.42 --> 5753.4
adapt they might figure a whole bunch of

5750.1 --> 5755.860000000001
things out but the cultural revolution

5753.4 --> 5758.099999999999
it only works with centralized media

5755.86 --> 5758.099999999999
control

5760.719 --> 5765.4
you can't transition like an entire

5763.119 --> 5769.119
country

5765.4 --> 5772.42
if you don't have media control

5769.119 --> 5775.299999999999
that's also again where the Jew comes in

5772.42 --> 5777.4
a lot that's why they are always right

5775.3 --> 5780.52
there when there's some stupid cultural

5777.4 --> 5783.4
color Revolution

5780.52 --> 5786.780000000001
because that's done through

5783.4 --> 5786.78
big Media power

5792.34 --> 5797.88
and yeah the Jew happens to be very good

5795.46 --> 5797.88
at that

5799.6 --> 5804.6990000000005
not that they they are just kind of more

5802.239 --> 5807.299999999999
like mercenaries mostly though in that

5804.699 --> 5807.299999999999
setup

5809.08 --> 5811.619
right

5812.92 --> 5818.9800000000005
you got to realize that the Jew

5815.679 --> 5822.04
in well those types of scenarios are

5818.98 --> 5825.099999999999
mostly functioning

5822.04 --> 5827.56
as mercenaries because they are the ones

5825.1 --> 5829.659000000001
that can actually do it

5827.56 --> 5831.04
they have this skill they're there for

5829.659 --> 5833.86
their skill

5831.04 --> 5835.54
not because everybody wants their

5833.86 --> 5837.639
culture or something right no this is

5835.54 --> 5841.179
for their skills because they're good at

5837.639 --> 5845.26
big things big operations organization

5841.179 --> 5848.26
oversight long-term tactics and so yeah

5845.26 --> 5850.360000000001
they end up at a lot of the head of

5848.26 --> 5852.400000000001
these types of situations

5850.36 --> 5854.38
cultural revolutions

5852.4 --> 5856.119
because they're just good at organizing

5854.38 --> 5859.119
it

5856.119 --> 5861.339999999999
doesn't mean that they are the ones

5859.119 --> 5862.96
taking control now they are just kind of

5861.34 --> 5865.92
like the operator

5862.96 --> 5865.92
a lot of the times

5867.94 --> 5874.719
so yeah it's always rather like who is

5872.26 --> 5878.02
it's not like oh the Jew is right there

5874.719 --> 5880.42
he's he's doing all that no no no he's

5878.02 --> 5882.820000000001
just fulfilling a function

5880.42 --> 5888.179
who's allowing him to do that

5882.82 --> 5888.179
the laws well then aren't the laws wrong

5888.34 --> 5890.88
right

5892.48 --> 5899.199
just look at Russia

5895.179 --> 5900.639
is did you constantly organizing gay

5899.199 --> 5903.759999999999
parades

5900.639 --> 5905.1990000000005
no why well not because he wouldn't like

5903.76 --> 5908.619000000001
to do that

5905.199 --> 5911.32
right it's because the laws they just

5908.619 --> 5913.86
don't allow it oh no how dare they oh

5911.32 --> 5913.86
yeah yeah

5914.619 --> 5919.839999999999
two uh-huh yeah I don't like gay that's

5917.739 --> 5922.599999999999
right

5919.84 --> 5924.88
but yeah they're not doing it if they're

5922.6 --> 5927.1
not allowed right if the law

5924.88 --> 5929.02
doesn't allow them to do what they do

5927.1 --> 5931.54
then they're not going to do it or they

5929.02 --> 5933.1
might do it in secret but that's that's

5931.54 --> 5934.659
a whole lot of matter that's their

5933.1 --> 5936.76
business right

5934.659 --> 5939.719
ugh

5936.76 --> 5939.719
I'm just saying

5939.94 --> 5943.719
like

5941.86 --> 5945.78
you

5943.719 --> 5949.42
media

5945.78 --> 5951.28
Empires like on porn or something they

5949.42 --> 5954.9400000000005
can't form

5951.28 --> 5957.639
if it's not allowed they can build like

5954.94 --> 5959.08
a big Empire if it's illegal because

5957.639 --> 5962.5
then you have to do everything in secret

5959.08 --> 5965.26
and that's not profitable it's hassle

5962.5 --> 5967.06
it's dangerous risky

5965.26 --> 5968.860000000001
right but if it's allowed yeah then it

5967.06 --> 5971.139
can just build it bang and they don't

5968.86 --> 5973.719
have any moral objections it's like

5971.139 --> 5976.2390000000005
they're the thing they do

5973.719 --> 5979.179
and so they become big at it

5976.239 --> 5982.419999999999
but that's not the Jew's fault it's

5979.179 --> 5984.58
because it's legal

5982.42 --> 5987.76
they technically didn't do anything

5984.58 --> 5990.239
wrong according to the law

5987.76 --> 5990.2390000000005
see

5996.52 --> 6000.06
right anyway

6000.5 --> 6004.34
let's see what's going on

6018.78 --> 6024.36
hmm doesn't seem like there's animal for

6021.42 --> 6027.139
a panel

6024.36 --> 6027.139
too bad

6027.9 --> 6032.5199999999995
I'll just continue the show it's been a

6030.06 --> 6035.54
good show so far

6032.52 --> 6035.540000000001
and I got more

6038.159 --> 6041.96
wow look at that

6043.26 --> 6048.900000000001
a bit of a grayish Haze up there as well

6046.619 --> 6053.0599999999995
though and

6048.9 --> 6053.0599999999995
that there's still just plenty of Sun

6055.739 --> 6058.339999999999
got that

6059.159 --> 6064.159
thank you

6061.5 --> 6064.159
the picture

6075.3 --> 6081.08
hey stopping traffic in my rest ahead

6078.48 --> 6081.08
good morning

6109.08 --> 6112.94
23 hmm

6118.5 --> 6122.28
never really watched the news that's

6120.3 --> 6126.54
very wise of you

6122.28 --> 6129.42
I wouldn't I mean when I was 23 I was

6126.54 --> 6132.0199999999995
still watching the news

6129.42 --> 6132.02
oh did I

6133.56 --> 6136.219
die though yeah

6136.86 --> 6140.719
yeah that was still pre-internet

6140.76 --> 6148.1990000000005
it's really after

6143.46 --> 6148.199
I guess after my mother died 2005

6148.38 --> 6153.36
that's

6150.139 --> 6155.88
2006 seven that's when I kind of first

6153.36 --> 6159.42
discovered Alex Jones

6155.88 --> 6161.219
and that's when I really got hit like

6159.42 --> 6163.679
that's when I became a conspiracy

6161.219 --> 6166.199
theorist and like extremely paranoid at

6163.679 --> 6167.52
first because I just totally bought into

6166.199 --> 6170.28
it

6167.52 --> 6173.1
and I kind of needed that I needed that

6170.28 --> 6178.159
to to push it all off me because I was

6173.1 --> 6178.159000000001
very much used to relying on it

6188.52 --> 6193.619000000001
right and before I even like 9 11 I knew

6192.179 --> 6195.84
there was something wrong I just didn't

6193.619 --> 6197.759999999999
know how and I knew that I didn't like

6195.84 --> 6200.1
the wars and

6197.76 --> 6201.3
Iraq and all that that none of that made

6200.1 --> 6205.56
any sense

6201.3 --> 6207.96
yeah didn't have to know what 911 was in

6205.56 --> 6209.639
order to figure that out that this is

6207.96 --> 6212.58
all nonsense all these military

6209.639 --> 6214.679
operations are complete [ __ ]

6212.58 --> 6217.26
and at first I blend oh look at the

6214.679 --> 6220.1990000000005
stupid right wing oh there's the right

6217.26 --> 6220.9800000000005
Wings it's their fault and then later I

6220.199 --> 6223.619
only

6220.98 --> 6226.86
figured out like whoa this

6223.619 --> 6228.839999999999
America is in like some really deep

6226.86 --> 6231.48
Voodoo [ __ ]

6228.84 --> 6232.92
there's some real creepy games going on

6231.48 --> 6235.4
there

6232.92 --> 6235.4
like

6237.119 --> 6241.679
right left paradigm

6240.3 --> 6242.6
to

6241.679 --> 6244.82
to

6242.6 --> 6249.3
satanic Brothers

6244.82 --> 6251.58
ruling Over America with the tag team

6249.3 --> 6253.320000000001
situation going

6251.58 --> 6255.42
that's when I started to figure that out

6253.32 --> 6257.759999999999
well I would have never figured that out

6255.42 --> 6260.219
if I just kept watching TV and news and

6257.76 --> 6263.46
all that on TV

6260.219 --> 6265.639
it really took Alex Jones to pull me in

6263.46 --> 6265.639
there

6265.98 --> 6272.36
movies like The Obama Deception what a

6269.4 --> 6272.36
great movie at the time

6276.659 --> 6282.44
an end game which is still still

6279.06 --> 6282.4400000000005
incredibly relevant

6293.82 --> 6297.259999999999
24 and a half now

6297.54 --> 6305.719
23 and 90 80. oh geesh

6301.92 --> 6305.719
okay Jeff I didn't know

6306.42 --> 6310.7390000000005
didn't know you were that old oh they're

6308.76 --> 6313.26
not that that's necessarily old it's

6310.739 --> 6314.638999999999
just that you seemed very young I guess

6313.26 --> 6318.320000000001
that's a good thing

6314.639 --> 6318.32
right young in spirit

6335.48 --> 6338.959999999999
right anyway

6348.179 --> 6352.28
seasoned veteran yeah

6355.679 --> 6359.28
right you're still fully young well

6357.719 --> 6362.639
that's the most important part right

6359.28 --> 6364.199
that's that's the real youth

6362.639 --> 6367.9800000000005
that's the spirit

6364.199 --> 6370.98
the real youth is not this husk of Flesh

6367.98 --> 6373.199
that does is yeah that is subject at the

6370.98 --> 6375.54
entropy it's the spirit that rests

6373.199 --> 6379.94
inside of it that's

6375.54 --> 6379.94
where the real youth is determined

6381.42 --> 6387.0
would it surprise anybody to to realize

6384.54 --> 6391.159
that when I was really young and the

6387.0 --> 6391.159
little kid I felt incredibly old

6391.44 --> 6396.178999999999
and actually as I'm growing older

6394.26 --> 6398.1
surprisingly I'm starting to feel

6396.179 --> 6399.659
younger

6398.1 --> 6402.6
isn't that weird

6399.659 --> 6404.219
but actually younger like my spirit has

6402.6 --> 6406.92
more

6404.219 --> 6408.54
of that youth in it when one when I was

6406.92 --> 6410.4
a little kid

6408.54 --> 6412.199
yeah I had the energy but it would

6410.4 --> 6416.638999999999
always just hurt me

6412.199 --> 6419.719
I was very passive once I got going some

6416.639 --> 6423.78
inspired about something I would be like

6419.719 --> 6427.26
incredible ideas heavy sci-fi and future

6423.78 --> 6430.44
is anything right but in general with my

6427.26 --> 6433.02
social interactions I was like

6430.44 --> 6435.54
I can't really express myself because as

6433.02 --> 6437.639
soon as I do exactly express myself as

6435.54 --> 6440.639
how I feel and with the energy level

6437.639 --> 6442.38
that I have it's just gonna put off and

6440.639 --> 6444.4800000000005
offend people

6442.38 --> 6446.6990000000005
and that happened a lot when I was a

6444.48 --> 6449.459999999999
little kid

6446.699 --> 6451.919999999999
again yeah some people thought it was

6449.46 --> 6454.08
absolutely brilliant and others they

6451.92 --> 6457.52
hated me and that's even like as a

6454.08 --> 6457.5199999999995
pre-teen as a little kid

6460.139 --> 6466.26
but yeah now that I'm growing older I

6462.84 --> 6468.84
just have more room for that same spirit

6466.26 --> 6470.219
I guess that felt really old when I was

6468.84 --> 6474.179
young

6470.219 --> 6477.92
more room for it to actually manifest

6474.179 --> 6477.92
what's coming out of that spirit

6479.52 --> 6484.679
it's almost like my youth is finally

6481.86 --> 6486.239
getting out of that cage youth was

6484.679 --> 6488.28
always there I just couldn't do anything

6486.239 --> 6491.599999999999
it was trapped and when you feel trapped

6488.28 --> 6491.599999999999
that makes you feel old

6494.82 --> 6502.08
no wonder that even in my vision which I

6498.239 --> 6505.32
had in when I was 17 I was really

6502.08 --> 6508.86
desperate like I wanted to be like I was

6505.32 --> 6510.659
now I felt trapped I felt trapped in a

6508.86 --> 6513.36
world that I had just started to figure

6510.659 --> 6516.0599999999995
out was actually really evil and

6513.36 --> 6518.9
manipulative and that I was trapped in

6516.06 --> 6518.900000000001
the manipulation

6519.659 --> 6526.259999999999
and I felt doomed at the time and I was

6523.26 --> 6529.1990000000005
just like wow look at me in the future I

6526.26 --> 6531.119000000001
am so free I get it I'm I'm where I'm

6529.199 --> 6533.04
supposed to be I can do what I'm

6531.119 --> 6536.639
supposed to do

6533.04 --> 6538.679
and I wanted that now I was like now I

6536.639 --> 6541.8
don't want to wait 20 years for this

6538.679 --> 6544.92
[ __ ] I want it now I need this now

6541.8 --> 6548.6990000000005
I'm trapped now I need that I need that

6544.92 --> 6549.6
From My Future Self right now to get out

6548.699 --> 6550.98
of this

6549.6 --> 6552.780000000001
he couldn't

6550.98 --> 6554.879999999999
couldn't

6552.78 --> 6557.78
terribly frustrated

6554.88 --> 6557.78
about that

6566.76 --> 6572.52
and the dark ones they tried to trick me

6569.159 --> 6575.28
into taking it away like it was some

6572.52 --> 6577.02
kind of a thorn in my own eye because I

6575.28 --> 6579.0599999999995
couldn't get

6577.02 --> 6581.88
what I was going to become

6579.06 --> 6584.400000000001
right there right then

6581.88 --> 6588.4800000000005
they tried to convince me to basically

6584.4 --> 6591.96
oh you you're never going to be that so

6588.48 --> 6594.959999999999
let me take that power off your hands oh

6591.96 --> 6596.219
you won't have to face what you can't

6594.96 --> 6598.619
have

6596.219 --> 6600.78
it's all a trick though and I didn't

6598.619 --> 6603.48
fall for it

6600.78 --> 6605.759999999999
but they they literally tried to torture

6603.48 --> 6609.0599999999995
me mentally

6605.76 --> 6611.159000000001
like that I was faced with people that

6609.06 --> 6613.139
were literally trying to seduce me to

6611.159 --> 6614.28
damage myself

6613.139 --> 6616.139
yeah

6614.28 --> 6618.659
and by the way

6616.139 --> 6621.32
you think that that's like rare or

6618.659 --> 6621.32
something no

6621.54 --> 6626.099
it's kind of a secret

6623.58 --> 6628.08
but I know

6626.099 --> 6630.599
people that have tried that with me

6628.08 --> 6633.119
gonna not to be specific

6630.599 --> 6636.599
they've done that with other people and

6633.119 --> 6642.199
literally made them commit suicide

6636.599 --> 6642.1990000000005
and then bragging to me about it

6670.739 --> 6675.78
so there's some really

6672.78 --> 6678.54
really savagely [ __ ] up people out

6675.78 --> 6680.28
there that are savagely [ __ ] up at a

6678.54 --> 6682.44
really young age

6680.28 --> 6685.5199999999995
and I'm pretty sure that they're made

6682.44 --> 6689.219
like that by their own parents

6685.52 --> 6692.580000000001
that literally like religiously violate

6689.219 --> 6695.28
them in order to traumatize them so that

6692.58 --> 6698.34
they can then be set railroaded to

6695.28 --> 6700.8
project that trauma not back on the ones

6698.34 --> 6703.26
that caused it but on the world like a

6700.8 --> 6705.96
vengeance

6703.26 --> 6709.56
it is

6705.96 --> 6713.34
just absolutely evil

6709.56 --> 6716.76
and relenting Evil

6713.34 --> 6718.619000000001
where you literally can you imagine

6716.76 --> 6721.8
taking your own kids and all their

6718.619 --> 6725.04
innocence and just on purpose corrupting

6721.8 --> 6727.400000000001
them to make them want to commit evil on

6725.04 --> 6727.4
the world

6733.139 --> 6738.659000000001
just

6734.46 --> 6740.76
realize what it's like to know that

6738.659 --> 6743.339999999999
that exists

6740.76 --> 6745.92
sometimes I think it's a miracle that I

6743.34 --> 6749.34
haven't like murdered people

6745.92 --> 6753.86
it is really kind of a miracle in a way

6749.34 --> 6753.860000000001
having known things about people

6754.32 --> 6758.36
and how [ __ ] evil it is

6772.8 --> 6781.159000000001
Christian God now how about just God

6776.52 --> 6781.159000000001
just God the Creator yeah

6782.159 --> 6788.04
the [ __ ] are you talking about

6784.32 --> 6790.739
New Age philosophy Oh you mean

6788.04 --> 6794.34
things that Jesus said that aren't Canon

6790.739 --> 6798.299999999999
yeah that aren't put there by the

6794.34 --> 6802.08
theocrat planners the same people that

6798.3 --> 6805.6990000000005
that actually designed from scratch

6802.08 --> 6809.099
communism and the globe those people

6805.699 --> 6813.178999999999
that decided what Christianity really is

6809.099 --> 6816.92
for for the world and hunted down other

6813.179 --> 6820.56
Christians that did not recognize their

6816.92 --> 6823.7390000000005
sole Authority their Spiritual Authority

6820.56 --> 6827.599
which is a blatant contrast with

6823.739 --> 6827.598999999999
Christ's teachings yeah

6827.88 --> 6833.9400000000005
why don't we just use freedom and do a

6831.9 --> 6836.4
little deeper study into everything

6833.94 --> 6838.86
Jesus has said including that which

6836.4 --> 6841.199
isn't Canon

6838.86 --> 6844.86
huh

6841.199 --> 6848.219
oh it's not canon so I'm going to ignore

6844.86 --> 6851.5199999999995
that he said it can you imagine

6848.219 --> 6853.679
that people actually use as an argument

6851.52 --> 6857.639
that they ignore things that were

6853.679 --> 6860.82
recorded recordedly said by Jesus Christ

6857.639 --> 6864.119
which they say is God

6860.82 --> 6867.78
and then they ignore it because priests

6864.119 --> 6870.179
in the past decided to leave that text

6867.78 --> 6872.58
out of the Bible

6870.179 --> 6877.02
can you imagine you're ignoring

6872.58 --> 6880.86
information spoken by yourself declared

6877.02 --> 6884.820000000001
God because a bunch of priests in your

6880.86 --> 6889.759999999999
past left that part out and tell you to

6884.82 --> 6889.759999999999
ignore the words of your God

6897.48 --> 6902.419999999999
foreign

6899.63 --> 6906.08
[Music]

6902.42 --> 6906.08
bunch of freaks

6907.86 --> 6915.179
I like how Owen Benjamin says it now

6911.219 --> 6917.94
you are satanists you are like the most

6915.179 --> 6921.38
satanic satanists

6917.94 --> 6921.379999999999
that could ever be

6923.58 --> 6930.78
modern Catholic format-based Christians

6927.179 --> 6932.6990000000005
are the most satanic satanists that can

6930.78 --> 6936.239
ever exist

6932.699 --> 6938.638999999999
because you are diametrically violating

6936.239 --> 6941.239
everything that Christ stood for

6938.639 --> 6944.46
everything he said

6941.239 --> 6949.04
diametrically opposing it all

6944.46 --> 6953.599
you are the most satanic anti-christian

6949.04 --> 6953.599
satanists that could ever exist

6960.659 --> 6962.9
foreign

6967.86 --> 6974.759999999999
[Applause]

6970.56 --> 6978.0
I need to get that off my chest

6974.76 --> 6981.139
yeah and it's never gonna go away I will

6978.0 --> 6983.06
never drop that you

6981.139 --> 6987.119
Christians

6983.06 --> 6990.860000000001
Canon Christians oh Jesus died for our

6987.119 --> 6994.82
sins so we can squirt Christians you are

6990.86 --> 6994.82
the satanists

6995.239 --> 6999.659
unwittingly I know you think you're

6997.619 --> 7001.04
Christians you are exactly the opposite

6999.659 --> 7004.82
of Christians

7001.04 --> 7008.0
and under that culture that was created

7004.82 --> 7012.0199999999995
for you that calls itself Christian

7008.0 --> 7014.599
the most damage has been done to

7012.02 --> 7017.119000000001
Christianity that could ever have been

7014.599 --> 7021.4400000000005
conceived

7017.119 --> 7025.159
yeah Catholic Church did the most damage

7021.44 --> 7028.119
to Christianity in world history it

7025.159 --> 7031.638999999999
destroyed every grassroot Christianity

7028.119 --> 7033.5599999999995
attacked them murdered them tortured

7031.639 --> 7037.159000000001
them

7033.56 --> 7040.580000000001
more Christians have been tortured

7037.159 --> 7041.9
by Catholics than probably any group in

7040.58 --> 7043.4
the world

7041.9 --> 7046.46
in a Time

7043.4 --> 7048.379999999999
when there yeah now there's billions of

7046.46 --> 7050.3
people supposedly there's a different

7048.38 --> 7052.34
skill it's different times a different

7050.3 --> 7054.1990000000005
type of Christians you're dealing with

7052.34 --> 7058.6990000000005
right

7054.199 --> 7062.419999999999
they routed Christianity they destroyed

7058.699 --> 7065.659
it they murdered them and wrote them out

7062.42 --> 7068.5
of their history books erased them from

7065.659 --> 7068.5
even history

7068.719 --> 7074.679
the Catholic church is the Church of

7071.84 --> 7074.679
Satan

7075.56 --> 7082.580000000001
the Antichrist church that's what it

7078.8 --> 7085.52
really is yeah and everything they do is

7082.58 --> 7087.44
a part of that and all that crap that

7085.52 --> 7090.38
other churches

7087.44 --> 7092.0599999999995
yeah do oh we're slightly different oh

7090.38 --> 7094.76
you're slightly different so you're

7092.06 --> 7097.099
slightly different from the Antichrist

7094.76 --> 7100.099
church are you well that still makes you

7097.099 --> 7103.0
an antichrist Church yeah because you

7100.099 --> 7106.88
should be exactly the diametric

7103.0 --> 7108.86
opposition of everything they do and

7106.88 --> 7112.3
then you can call yourself Christian

7108.86 --> 7116.36
yeah if you diametrically opposed

7112.3 --> 7118.34
exactly everything they do that's when I

7116.36 --> 7120.679
think you can call yourself a Christian

7118.34 --> 7123.02
not always just a slight little

7120.679 --> 7125.599
difference or we see this slightly

7123.02 --> 7128.0
different oh yeah well you're still an

7125.599 --> 7130.159000000001
anti-christian

7128.0 --> 7132.199
yeah

7130.159 --> 7134.0599999999995
anti-christian

7132.199 --> 7136.9
you think you're a Christian you're an

7134.06 --> 7136.900000000001
anti-christian

7156.199 --> 7161.719
any religion

7159.5 --> 7164.06
that tells you

7161.719 --> 7166.94
this is the only thing you can believe

7164.06 --> 7169.820000000001
everything you philosophize

7166.94 --> 7174.08
and take Serious has to be based on this

7169.82 --> 7176.92
specific limited amount of text

7174.08 --> 7181.159
is automatically an

7176.92 --> 7184.6990000000005
anti-christian religion why because did

7181.159 --> 7187.94
Jesus ever tell you not to inform

7184.699 --> 7190.339999999999
yourself oh Jesus oh no you can only

7187.94 --> 7192.619
look at this document no no he didn't

7190.34 --> 7194.4800000000005
say that he didn't say that at all he

7192.619 --> 7196.94
said you have to actually understand

7194.48 --> 7198.5
things you have to inform yourself if

7196.94 --> 7199.759999999999
you want to overcome an obstacle you

7198.5 --> 7201.739
have to understand it you have to read

7199.76 --> 7205.6990000000005
into it you have to get the people you

7201.739 --> 7207.678999999999
have to learn their ways oh oh well yeah

7205.699 --> 7211.339999999999
then you're having gonna have to read

7207.679 --> 7213.4400000000005
something that's not in that little book

7211.34 --> 7216.26
yeah yeah

7213.44 --> 7218.739
oh you can't it can only be in that

7216.26 --> 7222.400000000001
little book you're an

7218.739 --> 7222.4
anti-christian then

7227.57 --> 7230.679999999999
[Music]

7245.36 --> 7247.96
foreign

7252.4 --> 7256.12
[Music]

7257.36 --> 7262.36
what makes you a Christian what makes

7259.28 --> 7262.36
you an anti-christian

7263.0 --> 7268.099
do as Jesus

7265.46 --> 7272.42
says

7268.099 --> 7275.06
as he taught that makes you a Christian

7272.42 --> 7276.619
oh you follow a tradition you're in a

7275.06 --> 7279.9800000000005
group and they do all kinds of things

7276.619 --> 7284.179
are those things exactly what Jesus said

7279.98 --> 7286.699
as in the esoterics of it the purpose

7284.179 --> 7290.78
the reason why

7286.699 --> 7294.739
or are you just frolicking around

7290.78 --> 7297.0199999999995
kind of like basking in the painting

7294.739 --> 7298.58
of Jesus and what he stood for and

7297.02 --> 7300.5
everything that was said about him

7298.58 --> 7302.48
afterward

7300.5 --> 7306.32
by priests

7302.48 --> 7310.218999999999
right because that's not Christian

7306.32 --> 7315.08
that's Ida it's idolatry

7310.219 --> 7316.159
of iconography based on Christ not the

7315.08 --> 7319.639
teachings

7316.159 --> 7323.54
the teachings diametrically oppose all

7319.639 --> 7325.28
of that and he literally warned you

7323.54 --> 7328.719
about it

7325.28 --> 7328.719
in the Bible

7346.52 --> 7354.320000000001
how are you following Christ's teachings

7350.239 --> 7356.659
by kneeling in front of a wooden statue

7354.32 --> 7358.159
of a cross with a man

7356.659 --> 7359.54
suffering

7358.159 --> 7362.0599999999995
on it

7359.54 --> 7365.0
how how is that following Christ's

7362.06 --> 7368.780000000001
teachings what are you doing

7365.0 --> 7370.76
to enrich yourself with God's wisdom

7368.78 --> 7373.0
through Christ's teachings when you do

7370.76 --> 7373.0
that

7376.4 --> 7381.44
right you're in a church you're standing

7379.28 --> 7383.0
in front of big wooden cross with Christ

7381.44 --> 7385.699
under oh

7383.0 --> 7388.76
yeah and you're kneeling and what are

7385.699 --> 7390.5
you thinking when you do that

7388.76 --> 7392.780000000001
are you

7390.5 --> 7395.719
learning something about Christ's

7392.78 --> 7397.759999999999
teachings when you do that

7395.719 --> 7401.139
are you

7397.76 --> 7404.54
or are you kind of

7401.139 --> 7407.4800000000005
idolizing an icon and saying oh

7404.54 --> 7409.639
you know so much about suffering could

7407.48 --> 7412.5199999999995
you please take some more suffering from

7409.639 --> 7416.06
me and make this all right I'll Trust

7412.52 --> 7418.88
you God and basically dwelling and just

7416.06 --> 7421.46
like who are you chanting to are you

7418.88 --> 7423.4400000000005
actually improving yourself in order to

7421.46 --> 7425.119
improve the world according to Christ's

7423.44 --> 7426.98
teachings when you do that

7425.119 --> 7429.679
or are you just like moaning and

7426.98 --> 7432.879999999999
complaining to a statue

7429.679 --> 7432.88
what are you really doing

7455.659 --> 7460.28
right exactly getting wisdom says his

7458.42 --> 7464.38
church would be corrupt I told you he

7460.28 --> 7464.38
literally warned you about this

7466.219 --> 7472.52
and it is effectively described how it

7470.239 --> 7474.619
is being done

7472.52 --> 7478.88
in the Bible

7474.619 --> 7481.339999999999
it's corrupting in the Bible right there

7478.88 --> 7484.46
in front of you and you don't even

7481.34 --> 7486.5
realize it's happening right in front of

7484.46 --> 7489.199
you in that Bible

7486.5 --> 7490.52
it is corrupting right there it is

7489.199 --> 7492.678999999999
corrupting

7490.52 --> 7494.659000000001
and you don't even see it

7492.679 --> 7496.88
because you you forgot

7494.659 --> 7499.04
the warning parts

7496.88 --> 7501.26
of Christ what he actually said what he

7499.04 --> 7502.46
told you to do it just like oh no no

7501.26 --> 7504.8
this is just

7502.46 --> 7507.139
move that over to the Past you know he

7504.8 --> 7509.06
already did that he just died for our

7507.139 --> 7511.82
sin so everything is all right oh so

7509.06 --> 7514.280000000001
you're not actually gonna figure out

7511.82 --> 7516.44
why he changed the world through his

7514.28 --> 7518.36
wisdom then

7516.44 --> 7520.339999999999
what did he do what do you actually tell

7518.36 --> 7523.098999999999
you to do you're not gonna go there yet

7520.34 --> 7526.46
you're just gonna go oh we gotta follow

7523.099 --> 7528.56
the teachings of Paul and all these

7526.46 --> 7531.02
other people and the priests that have

7528.56 --> 7532.88
come since that are recommending us what

7531.02 --> 7536.119000000001
to do oh really

7532.88 --> 7537.6990000000005
so how how do those recommendations in

7536.119 --> 7539.78
the new

7537.699 --> 7544.299999999999
Traditions you're following how does

7539.78 --> 7544.3
that equate with Christ's teachings

7546.619 --> 7552.739
I'm pretty sure if you just read that

7549.5 --> 7554.84
back and just saw him say oh that my

7552.739 --> 7557.48
church will be corrupted you'd be like

7554.84 --> 7560.360000000001
oh [ __ ]

7557.48 --> 7563.839999999999
it is corrupted I'm in it I don't even

7560.36 --> 7567.139
realize it it's corrupted it's corrupted

7563.84 --> 7571.52
right now the things that we do here

7567.139 --> 7573.32
are a mockery they're a mockery of

7571.52 --> 7576.320000000001
Christ teachings

7573.32 --> 7578.719
all of it is a giant mockery

7576.32 --> 7581.36
and his teachings are still there in the

7578.719 --> 7585.099
book but people are maneuvered

7581.36 --> 7588.739
psychologically spiritually to ignore

7585.099 --> 7593.179
Christ's teachings

7588.739 --> 7595.4
because it's actually an anti-christ

7593.179 --> 7599.9
religion

7595.4 --> 7604.42
it's there to shove that glorious Divine

7599.9 --> 7607.96
wisdom in your face and condition you to

7604.42 --> 7607.96
ignore it

7619.53 --> 7622.62
[Music]

7623.96 --> 7628.599
right I gotta take a two minute break

7625.76 --> 7628.599
I'll be right back

7633.139 --> 7635.32
foreign

7700.94 --> 7703.119
thank you

7719.16 --> 7722.3099999999995
[Music]

7722.36 --> 7725.32
and I'm back

7743.119 --> 7747.619
none of it actually have no that's not

7745.699 --> 7750.32
true

7747.619 --> 7752.679
something did happen but it was a

7750.32 --> 7752.679
rewrite

7753.199 --> 7757.28
it's basically a story based on real

7755.659 --> 7759.799999999999
events

7757.28 --> 7762.199
but the locations have been changed and

7759.8 --> 7765.4400000000005
so have some of the names

7762.199 --> 7768.0199999999995
but I'm very certain that Jesus Christ

7765.44 --> 7772.098999999999
was an individual that actually existed

7768.02 --> 7776.179
and that did break open up that can

7772.099 --> 7778.88
of wisdom for the first time like that

7776.179 --> 7780.7390000000005
and have it recorded and then the

7778.88 --> 7782.900000000001
Catholic Church came into being and

7780.739 --> 7785.178999999999
completely rearranged it basically hit

7782.9 --> 7789.379999999999
hid

7785.179 --> 7793.119
all of the origins and made and dilute

7789.38 --> 7795.679
yeah an illusionary version of it

7793.119 --> 7797.9
completely under their control

7795.679 --> 7800.3
but I am very sure that Jesus Christ

7797.9 --> 7803.42
actually did exist

7800.3 --> 7806.679
just not like it said in the Bible

7803.42 --> 7806.679
not in those places

7819.44 --> 7826.46
right and by the way like uh how the

7822.679 --> 7829.579
Bible is constructed which part

7826.46 --> 7832.099
was written by who which Apostles some

7829.579 --> 7833.96
Apostles didn't even exist

7832.099 --> 7835.579
they were basically just like

7833.96 --> 7836.719
Shakespeare

7835.579 --> 7840.86
right

7836.719 --> 7843.26
a conjured individual to bring forth

7840.86 --> 7846.139
writings of a group

7843.26 --> 7848.96
that was working on that so yeah the

7846.139 --> 7851.719
Bible is constructed

7848.96 --> 7856.34
it's a rewrite

7851.719 --> 7859.78
and relocated but Jesus Christ existed I

7856.34 --> 7859.78
know he did he has to

7860.9 --> 7866.0599999999995
and I don't care

7863.3 --> 7868.46
stopping traffic in my rest I don't care

7866.06 --> 7871.04
that you [ __ ] hate the Bible and that

7868.46 --> 7872.54
you think it's absolutely 100 fake with

7871.04 --> 7875.42
everything and you don't have to repeat

7872.54 --> 7878.44
that every time doesn't help

7875.42 --> 7878.4400000000005
doesn't help anybody

7879.86 --> 7886.239
it literally doesn't help it doesn't

7881.96 --> 7886.2390000000005
help you it doesn't help anybody else

7894.5 --> 7900.139
foreign

7896.8 --> 7902.659000000001
book that's the problem it's how it's

7900.139 --> 7906.079
being used that's the problem and what

7902.659 --> 7909.04
priests say about it

7906.079 --> 7909.04
that's the problem

7914.78 --> 7920.98
Bible is the real deal no it's not

7917.84 --> 7920.9800000000005
absolutely not

7922.46 --> 7930.92
it's a constructed rewrite story based

7926.9 --> 7933.679
on the real individual nothing happened

7930.92 --> 7937.219
nothing happened the way and in the

7933.679 --> 7940.099
places it was described nothing of that

7937.219 --> 7941.179
happened in the way and the places they

7940.099 --> 7944.119000000001
described

7941.179 --> 7947.06
it's a construction

7944.119 --> 7950.44
but Jesus Christ definitely existed and

7947.06 --> 7950.4400000000005
his wisdom is real

7964.639 --> 7969.5
100 no Timothy Crawford no it's not a

7968.3 --> 7973.900000000001
literal

7969.5 --> 7973.9
no it's absolutely not literal

7974.179 --> 7979.4
and it's not even metaphorical it's

7977.06 --> 7983.3
esoteric

7979.4 --> 7984.92
it's esoteric nothing about it is

7983.3 --> 7987.079000000001
literal

7984.92 --> 7989.599
because it's historically incorrect

7987.079 --> 7992.119
nothing happened like that it's not

7989.599 --> 7995.06
about even how it happened it's

7992.119 --> 7996.679
or where it happened it's about what

7995.06 --> 7999.079000000001
happened

7996.679 --> 8002.86
how did it change things

7999.079 --> 8005.92
and what happened as a result of it the

8002.86 --> 8009.098999999999
Bible is basically the story about how

8005.92 --> 8012.28
Christ his teachings were corrupted and

8009.099 --> 8017.679
it is the corruption and it's hiding it

8012.28 --> 8019.54
in plain sight how it is the corruption

8017.679 --> 8022.36
that doesn't mean that Jesus was

8019.54 --> 8023.199
corrupted he's real and his wisdom is

8022.36 --> 8026.92
real

8023.199 --> 8029.94
everything else about it is corrupted

8026.92 --> 8032.86
because it was designed to do that to

8029.94 --> 8036.339999999999
encapsulate Christ

8032.86 --> 8039.78
to prison him and to condition people to

8036.34 --> 8039.78
ignore his wisdom

8041.06 --> 8044.219
[Music]

8054.89 --> 8059.92
[Music]

8056.92 --> 8059.92
ah

8066.43 --> 8072.899
[Music]

8084.219 --> 8091.06
before yeah Bible's the story with truth

8087.52 --> 8094.2390000000005
in it in a sense well it's

8091.06 --> 8098.26
Jesus and his wisdom is true and his

8094.239 --> 8100.48
esoteric implications are far-reaching

8098.26 --> 8102.400000000001
but everything else is there basically

8100.48 --> 8104.739
as a distraction

8102.4 --> 8106.78
away from his teachings from the

8104.739 --> 8109.419999999999
purities of his teachings to basically

8106.78 --> 8112.96
try to harness it

8109.42 --> 8117.4
to harness like a driving light and turn

8112.96 --> 8118.4800000000005
it into a vehicle of power and mind

8117.4 --> 8120.94
control

8118.48 --> 8124.119
that's what the Bible is it's a vehicle

8120.94 --> 8127.259999999999
of power and mind control harnessing

8124.119 --> 8127.259999999999
Christ's power

8128.32 --> 8135.759999999999
like an spiritual enslavement

8132.699 --> 8137.919999999999
can you imagine that that the Bible in

8135.76 --> 8139.54
itself is almost like

8137.92 --> 8142.9
Jesus

8139.54 --> 8144.5199999999995
still dragging that cross around to his

8142.9 --> 8146.739
death

8144.52 --> 8149.52
that's what the existence of the Bible

8146.739 --> 8149.5199999999995
is

8150.46 --> 8155.92
right the existence of it and everything

8153.34 --> 8159.579
that's done with it is Jesus still

8155.92 --> 8163.3
dragging that cross to his Doom

8159.579 --> 8166.0
that's the Bible is that is that process

8163.3 --> 8168.179
esoterically it's prisoning imprisoning

8166.0 --> 8168.179
him

8168.76 --> 8173.88
making everybody ignore his wisdom

8174.219 --> 8178.9
yet oh but you're still eager to

8176.92 --> 8180.579
traditionally drink his blood and eat

8178.9 --> 8184.96
his flesh

8180.579 --> 8187.659
so wise of you that's like oh man

8184.96 --> 8190.38
teach me more wisdom about how to eat

8187.659 --> 8190.379999999999
your body

8190.599 --> 8194.34
yeah that's not what Christ taught

8194.62 --> 8197.099
all right

8207.04 --> 8211.599
Jesus is true God yeah that's that's all

8209.74 --> 8213.699999999999
fine

8211.599 --> 8216.58
he also said that others could surpass

8213.7 --> 8219.04
him and that they would

8216.58 --> 8222.039999999999
and I believed him

8219.04 --> 8225.7
and I accept the challenge

8222.04 --> 8227.319000000001
in my own way limited by my Earthly

8225.7 --> 8231.28
limitations

8227.319 --> 8233.439
but still ascending past it which is a

8231.28 --> 8236.2
part of that

8233.439 --> 8241.179
yeah so if Jesus

8236.2 --> 8242.559000000001
is literally God and you claim that then

8241.179 --> 8244.84
all are

8242.559 --> 8247.84
we all have it in ourselves

8244.84 --> 8251.62
the ability The Inheritance

8247.84 --> 8255.219000000001
the Divine spark the design that that

8251.62 --> 8257.399000000001
allows that to to manifest it's in us

8255.219 --> 8257.399
all

8270.88 --> 8276.58

thing in the world for you you better

8579.22 --> 8583.019999999999
damn well learn it for once

8592.24 --> 8597.899

8595.66 --> 8597.899
chat

8598.54 --> 8604.42
even if you're talking to somebody else

8600.7 --> 8607.359
I don't care you're not gonna talk

8604.42 --> 8609.58
say look if Christ would have called

8607.359 --> 8612.16
himself a God you should have been put

8609.58 --> 8613.899
down like a duck who the [ __ ] do you

8612.16 --> 8615.7
think you are saying something like that

8637.66 --> 8640.3
that's the toughest [ __ ] thing in the

8639.52 --> 8644.28
world

8640.3 --> 8644.279999999999
you better damn well learn it

8663.24 --> 8668.52
yeah yeah Timothy fine whatever

8677.56 --> 8681.939
Jesus said he is God

8680.2 --> 8685.960000000001
the god

8681.939 --> 8688.300000000001
does doesn't mean anything

8685.96 --> 8692.08
like what you think it means

8688.3 --> 8695.619999999999
Jesus is talking esoterics a lot he's

8692.08 --> 8698.439
talking about the very Core Essence

8695.62 --> 8700.54
of a human being is talking about

8698.439 --> 8703.0
everything

8700.54 --> 8706.720000000001
people just think that oh you couldn't

8703.0 --> 8709.24
have said that because then this no you

8706.72 --> 8711.039999999999
don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking

8709.24 --> 8713.14
about

8711.04 --> 8716.26
you don't even realize that the entire

8713.14 --> 8719.5
thing is a rewrite

8716.26 --> 8720.52
based on a real story that happened to

8719.5 --> 8722.68
him

8720.52 --> 8724.54
those words are real

8722.68 --> 8726.16
everything else has pretty much been

8724.54 --> 8729.220000000001
changed

8726.16 --> 8733.0
if he set something it's up to you to

8729.22 --> 8737.5
try to understand what he said and not

8733.0 --> 8740.02
listen to what other people say about it

8737.5 --> 8743.319
and with other people I mean pretty much

8740.02 --> 8745.899000000001
every [ __ ] else everybody in the

8743.319 --> 8749.439
entire [ __ ] world including priests

8745.899 --> 8752.76
including everybody everybody you need

8749.439 --> 8752.76
to figure out what it means

8754.74 --> 8760.3
can't just say he can't have said this

8757.66 --> 8761.74
or this is what he meant oh really this

8760.3 --> 8766.199999999999
is what he meant

8761.74 --> 8766.199999999999
why because other people told you that

8767.74 --> 8770.52
so

8780.819 --> 8783.0
foreign

8786.899 --> 8793.779999999999
do you even know what that means

8789.64 --> 8798.819
oh he is God oh he is literally born God

8793.78 --> 8801.58
or he has God in him like you don't know

8798.819 --> 8803.68
what that means

8801.58 --> 8807.16
you don't know what he was actually

8803.68 --> 8810.76
talking about he was talking esoterics

8807.16 --> 8812.859
Essence as in look

8810.76 --> 8816.78
purity

8812.859 --> 8816.78
true Purity within the design

8821.26 --> 8826.960000000001
and yet all these exeteric conclusions

8824.26 --> 8828.64
are drawn it's ridiculous

8826.96 --> 8831.759999999998
it's ridiculous

8828.64 --> 8833.56
you literally take something that's very

8831.76 --> 8836.62
deep esoteric

8833.56 --> 8839.14
and then you exeterize it and then you

8836.62 --> 8841.18
draw oh look at this and that and that

8839.14 --> 8843.64
that seems to contradict yeah because

8841.18 --> 8846.04
you did the same [ __ ] to that and now

8843.64 --> 8848.08
you're just puzzling your exoteric

8846.04 --> 8850.84
nonsense puzzle

8848.08 --> 8855.0
that doesn't actually mean anything has

8850.84 --> 8855.0
no empirical relation to anything

8878.62 --> 8880.859
foreign

8891.0 --> 8895.92
in The Offspring world the gods oh

8893.92 --> 8900.12
really

8895.92 --> 8900.12
or the sons of God

8900.88 --> 8907.0
Timothy Crawford you can't just roll

8903.88 --> 8908.38
that out and then accept then assume

8907.0 --> 8911.64
that everybody's going to take that

8908.38 --> 8911.64
exactly literal

8911.8 --> 8914.979
why don't you read a little bit more

8913.3 --> 8919.06
careful

8914.979 --> 8923.38
pretty sure that the sons of God not

8919.06 --> 8926.16
sons of gods little G God no the sons of

8923.38 --> 8926.16
God

8926.319 --> 8929.939
did that yeah

8930.58 --> 8934.14
are you gonna ignore that part

8941.62 --> 8945.819000000001
is your opinion is Christ the

8943.54 --> 8947.439
abandonment of truth that makes no

8945.819 --> 8950.979
logical sense

8947.439 --> 8953.34
that's syntax error it makes no sense to

8950.979 --> 8953.34
say that

8953.68 --> 8959.56
Christ the embodiment of truth no

8956.56 --> 8963.16
Christ was a person

8959.56 --> 8966.76
the truth is in essence

8963.16 --> 8971.979
it is information Spirit based

8966.76 --> 8975.1
Christ was a person was a human being

8971.979 --> 8977.319
truth is it as is in essence it's a

8975.1 --> 8980.08
concept it's not the same thing it

8977.319 --> 8982.18
doesn't it's not compatible I mean you

8980.08 --> 8982.979
can think it is in players oh look this

8982.18 --> 8987.04
connection

8982.979 --> 8990.819
oh it all makes sense no it doesn't

8987.04 --> 8992.92
why don't you just think things for what

8990.819 --> 8995.859
they really are instead of constantly

8992.92 --> 8998.58
playing that stupid little exoteric

8995.859 --> 8998.58
puzzle game

9006.359 --> 9011.640000000001
I'm sorry I'm still a little fired up

9008.64 --> 9014.34
here just rest had just really [ __ ]

9011.64 --> 9017.039999999999
pissed me off this garbage and he's

9014.34 --> 9021.84
dabbing that garbage he hates Christ

9017.04 --> 9023.7
admit it Rasta you hate Christ

9021.84 --> 9026.880000000001
you're one of the guys that would

9023.7 --> 9028.319000000001
jokingly say let him burn in a lake of

9026.88 --> 9030.839999999998
[ __ ]

9028.319 --> 9031.859
you would say that with fun I know you

9030.84 --> 9034.380000000001
would

9031.859 --> 9037.800000000001
you've been you've been putting that

9034.38 --> 9042.66
inside for a long I'm sick of it dude

9037.8 --> 9046.319
I'm sick of it not accepting that ever I

9042.66 --> 9050.28
will never find that acceptable

9046.319 --> 9053.3
and since you're not gonna change it

9050.28 --> 9053.300000000001
get out

9060.12 --> 9066.18
you don't respect Christ

9063.0 --> 9069.42
Rasta hat does not respect Christ he

9066.18 --> 9072.6
doesn't he just doesn't

9069.42 --> 9074.76
and it's unacceptable

9072.6 --> 9077.06
you can't have an intellectual

9074.76 --> 9081.06
conversation or a spiritual conversation

9077.06 --> 9084.119999999999
with that attitude with me

9081.06 --> 9087.26
I don't do that I never go there I will

9084.12 --> 9090.84
never go there I will never

9087.26 --> 9093.72
disrespect Christ like that and or

9090.84 --> 9095.819
accept other people that do that's why I

9093.72 --> 9098.16
get pissed off when people start

9095.819 --> 9100.5
chanting oh he died for my sins he died

9098.16 --> 9103.14
for no he [ __ ] didn't

9100.5 --> 9106.68
you egotistical bastard

9103.14 --> 9108.779999999999
no he [ __ ] didn't

9106.68 --> 9110.34
he lived

9108.78 --> 9113.720000000001
teach you

9110.34 --> 9113.72
how to overcome

9114.359 --> 9119.0
death did not save you

9119.22 --> 9125.64
there is no logical reason to assume

9123.479 --> 9127.979
that because it makes no logical sense

9125.64 --> 9131.34
there's no empiricism there's no thing

9127.979 --> 9133.38
that proves that that is true nothing

9131.34 --> 9136.56
proves that that is true

9133.38 --> 9139.92
no empirical proof yeah his teachings

9136.56 --> 9142.92
however are absolutely empirical

9139.92 --> 9146.399
they work you can test them they work

9142.92 --> 9149.64
they're true they're true on many levels

9146.399 --> 9153.24
that's the thing that saves you not his

9149.64 --> 9156.18
death his death does not take away your

9153.24 --> 9157.38
sins does not take away the price for

9156.18 --> 9161.220000000001
your sins

9157.38 --> 9165.06
so lie it's satanic

9161.22 --> 9167.519999999999
[ __ ] evil and dumb it's dumb and

9165.06 --> 9169.56
cowardice to think that

9167.52 --> 9171.66
what you can't just carry the weight of

9169.56 --> 9174.42
your own sins what are you [ __ ]

9171.66 --> 9176.34
weakling oh it's all so much oh so

9174.42 --> 9178.62
you're making a drama out of it too

9176.34 --> 9180.3
you're not just weak you're a drama

9178.62 --> 9182.52
queen too

9180.3 --> 9185.16
oh it's so much nobody could have oh

9182.52 --> 9187.74
yeah you can and people do if they're

9185.16 --> 9191.1
not [ __ ] wussies

9187.74 --> 9194.479
they can handle a challenge from God the

9191.1 --> 9194.479000000001
way we were designed to

9196.38 --> 9199.279999999999
foreign

9217.62 --> 9222.5
have a good day yeah

9220.02 --> 9222.5
fine

9226.26 --> 9230.22
yeah I'm appeal look Timothy is just a

9228.66 --> 9233.1
triggered funny

9230.22 --> 9236.66
right no Christian that devouts their

9233.1 --> 9239.7
entire life to ridiculous unprovable

9236.66 --> 9242.58
priest made chance

9239.7 --> 9245.04
that contradict Christ's teachings

9242.58 --> 9247.8
is is just gonna like oh yeah but you

9245.04 --> 9250.979000000001
dedicated your entire life to it in many

9247.8 --> 9252.599999999999
situations you reverted to that nonsense

9250.979 --> 9256.438999999998
chant

9252.6 --> 9258.54
and actually avoided responsibility it's

9256.439 --> 9260.28
a lot of down payment you made on that

9258.54 --> 9263.160000000002
delusion yeah it's going to be very

9260.28 --> 9265.859
painful to relinquish that

9263.16 --> 9268.26
so they're gonna defend it

9265.859 --> 9271.26
they're gonna chant some more

9268.26 --> 9277.52
because they already sacrificed so much

9271.26 --> 9277.52
for that ridiculous ridiculous chant

9279.6 --> 9284.58
that sucks it sucks when you realize

9282.12 --> 9286.560000000001
intellectually that you've been fooled

9284.58 --> 9288.539999999999
by yourself

9286.56 --> 9292.92
through others

9288.54 --> 9295.5
you let yourself be fooled by man and

9292.92 --> 9297.78
Christ warned it but you didn't take his

9295.5 --> 9301.02
word that serious did you

9297.78 --> 9303.0
no no you'll just take the softer

9301.02 --> 9305.220000000001
version the one the other priests talk

9303.0 --> 9306.42
about because that's how everybody deals

9305.22 --> 9308.34
with it that's a Christian because

9306.42 --> 9311.34
that's what everybody does no it's not

9308.34 --> 9314.22
being a Christian is actually extremely

9311.34 --> 9317.52
hard and Christ describes this

9314.22 --> 9318.84
the more true the closer to God the more

9317.52 --> 9321.84
punishing

9318.84 --> 9324.24
there is no soft Christianity soft

9321.84 --> 9325.56
Christianity is fake Christianity it's

9324.24 --> 9328.64
mockery

9325.56 --> 9328.64
it's fake

9334.46 --> 9338.3
hey that flat fellow

9360.84 --> 9365.34
yeah flatter Sage yeah that's what they

9363.24 --> 9367.5
say yeah that's because

9365.34 --> 9369.42
you know you know where that comes from

9367.5 --> 9372.54
oh you have to make some sort of a

9369.42 --> 9376.319
sacrifice to absolve your sin ah yeah

9372.54 --> 9378.300000000001
that's the classical satanic Pagan [ __ ]

9376.319 --> 9380.46
that's what that is

9378.3 --> 9382.679999999998
we have to make a sacrifice every now

9380.46 --> 9385.46
and then yeah yeah there used to be a

9382.68 --> 9385.460000000001
blood sacrifice

9385.74 --> 9390.119999999999
arguably still is in secret

9388.68 --> 9393.12
right

9390.12 --> 9396.0
oh so they're all we're just gonna

9393.12 --> 9399.960000000001
keep like we're stopping that tradition

9396.0 --> 9403.56
by just reminding you of how we did the

9399.96 --> 9407.399
Pagan thing with Christ and slaughtered

9403.56 --> 9410.06
him in Pagan tradition to absolve you of

9407.399 --> 9412.858999999999
your sin it's so sick

9410.06 --> 9415.519999999999
so sick

9412.859 --> 9415.52
girl

9419.34 --> 9427.2
yeah you know what the real sacrifice is

9423.62 --> 9429.960000000001
facing facing your sin

9427.2 --> 9433.68
facing the challenges of God

9429.96 --> 9435.66
that's the real sacrifice doing it not

9433.68 --> 9437.7
walking away making the right choice

9435.66 --> 9440.18
that's the sacrifice

9437.7 --> 9440.18
yeah

9440.28 --> 9444.84
it's internal it's spiritual

9442.8 --> 9448.08
that's the sacrifice

9444.84 --> 9449.479
you don't have to sacrifice a living

9448.08 --> 9453.42
being

9449.479 --> 9456.06
discontinue its life you don't have to

9453.42 --> 9459.18
like collect blood

9456.06 --> 9462.66
put it on some altar or make people none

9459.18 --> 9466.800000000001
of that that's all Earthly

9462.66 --> 9468.72
creepy [ __ ] that Christ diametrically

9466.8 --> 9471.479
opposed

9468.72 --> 9472.38
it's like his primary goal to oppose

9471.479 --> 9475.8
that

9472.38 --> 9478.08
how ironic that the entire religion that

9475.8 --> 9480.24
flowed forth from that and ended up

9478.08 --> 9483.6
dominating the world for a Time

9480.24 --> 9486.0
actually put him exactly in the

9483.6 --> 9488.34
sacrifice spot of everything he opposed

9486.0 --> 9490.859
again and that's just one thing

9488.34 --> 9492.359
everything about the entire Christian

9490.859 --> 9496.2
religion

9492.359 --> 9499.08
modern religion is anti-christian

9496.2 --> 9503.899000000001
everything it does everything it teaches

9499.08 --> 9506.76
that gets echoed by people by priests is

9503.899 --> 9511.38
diametrically opposed to what Christ

9506.76 --> 9511.380000000001
taught and therefore anti-christian

9522.72 --> 9528.319
um man certainly got on fire today

9536.819 --> 9543.3
all right I think I might have liked

9538.859 --> 9546.5
blown a gasket over and rest that but

9543.3 --> 9546.5
any boost

9549.78 --> 9556.140000000001
it's just

9551.52 --> 9561.42
he was using my energy to insert his

9556.14 --> 9564.119999999999
personal disdain for Christ secretly

9561.42 --> 9566.58
by saying these things it's like covert

9564.12 --> 9569.58
anti-christian I do not accept that

9566.58 --> 9572.819
Rasta I don't care if you can't

9569.58 --> 9577.38
prevent yourself from doing that

9572.819 --> 9580.979
you don't do it here I do not accept

9577.38 --> 9583.679999999998
do not accept

9580.979 --> 9587.099999999999
I don't care you can't handle it I don't

9583.68 --> 9592.939
care you can't handle yourself I dis

9587.1 --> 9592.939
a vow that [ __ ] I do not allow it

9594.84 --> 9599.7
so you're gonna have to find some

9596.58 --> 9604.52
freaking Satanist courtroom to vent that

9599.7 --> 9604.52
[ __ ] because I do not allow it

9621.54 --> 9627.720000000001
yeah flatter Sage I know right isn't it

9625.319 --> 9630.92
just crazy

9627.72 --> 9630.92
the Reversed world

9631.08 --> 9636.84
it's satanic it's where they started

9634.26 --> 9640.5
they started with Christianity

9636.84 --> 9642.899
which is actually anti-christianity

9640.5 --> 9646.319
then they moved on to the globe

9642.899 --> 9648.0
which is anti everything that's

9646.319 --> 9650.64
physically real

9648.0 --> 9653.88
and then they moved on

9650.64 --> 9658.08
to politics and ideology and then they

9653.88 --> 9660.539999999999
created Communists which is amoral

9658.08 --> 9663.6
which doesn't even recognize the

9660.54 --> 9666.84
existence of morality

9663.6 --> 9669.42
and therefore God

9666.84 --> 9671.1
yeah that's all coming out of the same

9669.42 --> 9675.0
thing

9671.1 --> 9675.0
Christian anti-christianity

9676.16 --> 9681.119999999999
anti-reality globe

9679.22 --> 9683.76
anti-god

9681.12 --> 9686.939
politics

9683.76 --> 9689.34
that's what we can thank the Jesuits and

9686.939 --> 9691.76
the Catholic church for that's what they

9689.34 --> 9691.76
created

9693.84 --> 9698.16
historically true

9695.279 --> 9701.359
it's historically true

9698.16 --> 9705.72
just look up who was involved Catholics

9701.359 --> 9707.7
Jesuits they're all in there all of it

9705.72 --> 9709.74
in all of it

9707.7 --> 9712.140000000001
yeah

9709.74 --> 9714.539999999999
Christianity

9712.14 --> 9717.319
the globe

9714.54 --> 9717.319000000001
communism

9721.02 --> 9726.380000000001
and arguably beyond that transhumanism

9728.279 --> 9732.319000000001
transhumanism might be the fourth

9732.42 --> 9738.06
the fourth apocalypse

9735.54 --> 9741.240000000002
right because I think that

9738.06 --> 9743.359
they even see it like they are The Four

9741.24 --> 9745.859
Horsemen of the Apocalypse

9743.359 --> 9749.34
anti-christian Christianity

9745.859 --> 9754.08
the globe false physical reality

9749.34 --> 9756.3
communism the false Godless Spirit ruler

9754.08 --> 9759.439
transhumanism

9756.3 --> 9763.019999999999
the the false disconnected replacement

9759.439 --> 9767.18
of of God's design it would be a

9763.02 --> 9767.18
complete Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

9773.399 --> 9776.3
wouldn't it

9777.18 --> 9782.220000000001
have they not all come

9779.46 --> 9785.46
and ruin everything

9782.22 --> 9788.76
shrouded us all in darkness degenerated

9785.46 --> 9792.72
our very very physical design

9788.76 --> 9794.58
over the ages ruined and poisoned our

9792.72 --> 9798.979
Earth

9794.58 --> 9798.979
our Paradise given to us by God

9819.6 --> 9825.960000000001
whoa kef gas head that's freaky never

9822.66 --> 9828.5
never thought of that connection

9825.96 --> 9828.5
oh

9833.399 --> 9837.66
whoa I've been going for two hours and

9835.62 --> 9840.439
40 minutes man

9837.66 --> 9840.439
hahaha

9882.6 --> 9886.380000000001
right I think I'm going to round out the

9884.46 --> 9888.479
show

9886.38 --> 9890.039999999999
I think this has gone on long enough for

9888.479 --> 9891.479
now

9890.04 --> 9894.26
huh

9891.479 --> 9894.26
what a show

9894.6 --> 9898.74
it's actually kind of split up into

9896.399 --> 9903.019999999999
subjects first like the whole media and

9898.74 --> 9903.02
protests and now like Christianity

9904.62 --> 9909.979000000001
should almost be split up into our four

9906.899 --> 9909.979
more hours yeah yeah

9915.24 --> 9918.84
no I'm not gonna make it four more hours

9917.16 --> 9923.16
that's not gonna

9918.84 --> 9923.16
I'm kind of like drained

9935.88 --> 9939.66
right but it was definitely an

9937.979 --> 9942.438999999998
interesting show and I got very

9939.66 --> 9942.439
passionate again

9944.52 --> 9950.279
and maybe overreacted a little against

9946.979 --> 9954.06
rest ahead but he was just pushing the

9950.279 --> 9956.939
wrong buttons at the wrong time

9954.06 --> 9958.56
and he the problem is not even that he

9956.939 --> 9960.899
does that right I pressed the wrong

9958.56 --> 9963.539999999999
button sometimes and then people get

9960.899 --> 9966.539999999999
pissed off and then guess how I respond

9963.54 --> 9968.580000000002
I'm like oh [ __ ] I didn't realize that

9966.54 --> 9971.279
I'll try to correct it no but that's not

9968.58 --> 9974.1
what Rasta does he's like no you're a

9971.279 --> 9976.02
[ __ ] you were wrong in assuming that I

9974.1 --> 9977.279
meant that like

9976.02 --> 9979.2
that

9977.279 --> 9982.439
was the problem

9979.2 --> 9985.140000000001
that specifically

9982.439 --> 9989.1
he doesn't respect it he doesn't respect

9985.14 --> 9991.019999999999
how serious the conversation was if you

9989.1 --> 9993.479000000001
respond like you're being a little [ __ ]

9991.02 --> 9996.54
that means

9993.479 --> 9999.479
you are not there to be part of that

9996.54 --> 10002.060000000001
moment of that energy

9999.479 --> 10005.72
you're parasiting

10002.06 --> 10009.58
because you you don't respect

10005.72 --> 10009.58
why that all happened

10010.58 --> 10016.3
and I had to respond like that and I

10012.68 --> 10016.300000000001
wrote it I use that energy

10020.42 --> 10025.939
but yeah

10022.399 --> 10027.26
it does always kind of like I don't like

10025.939 --> 10029.18
it

10027.26 --> 10032.42
when I have those types of situations

10029.18 --> 10034.7
with Rasta because it's a long-term

10032.42 --> 10036.02
problem it's I've known him for years

10034.7 --> 10038.54
now

10036.02 --> 10042.439
and he's always been like that

10038.54 --> 10045.979000000001
always and I don't know how to deal with

10042.439 --> 10047.960000000001
it other than get really strict

10045.979 --> 10049.278999999999
sometimes when I just can't handle it

10047.96 --> 10051.8
anymore

10049.279 --> 10055.52
and I I hope

10051.8 --> 10058.699999999999
gotten a message out of it

10055.52 --> 10060.74
or he might get just really pissed off

10058.7 --> 10063.08
with me and start trolling me now that

10060.74 --> 10066.439
could happen he's done that before

10063.08 --> 10070.22
I don't I can't really stop it anymore

10066.439 --> 10073.16
I don't yeah just I really hope he gets

10070.22 --> 10076.039999999999
it I really hope he understands why I

10073.16 --> 10077.72
did that I did not do it to humiliate

10076.04 --> 10080.359
him

10077.72 --> 10083.42
I did it because I thought it was just

10080.359 --> 10086.0
really really disrespectful and he

10083.42 --> 10087.62
didn't even understand it and that's a

10086.0 --> 10090.2
problem

10087.62 --> 10093.2
right

10090.2 --> 10093.2
so

10093.38 --> 10097.699999999999
despite that though it was excellent

10095.84 --> 10100.22
show I'm very happy about it very

10097.7 --> 10103.819000000001
energetic the whole way

10100.22 --> 10106.039999999999
almost Owen Benjamin level

10103.819 --> 10107.96
always seems to be able to do that I

10106.04 --> 10109.1
don't know how he does it man

10107.96 --> 10113.358999999999
it's just

10109.1 --> 10114.92
it's just a real stage talent I guess

10113.359 --> 10117.380000000001
