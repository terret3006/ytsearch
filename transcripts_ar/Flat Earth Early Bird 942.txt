[Music]

96.159 --> 101.84
pretty much the same as yesterday

102.0 --> 104.88
cloud covered

105.92 --> 113.119
wet rain here

109.28 --> 115.84
in there although not as continuously as

113.119 --> 115.84
two days ago

117.759 --> 122.07900000000001
less wind maybe but yeah

125.92 --> 129.84
it's definitely cooling off over here

130.319 --> 135.04
hope it'll get back to that summer heat

132.72 --> 138.56
again at some point

135.04 --> 142.319
that would be nice but for now

138.56 --> 144.48
it's kind of like this and hey it's not

142.319 --> 147.599
really cold

144.48 --> 153.04
it's not like it's constantly wet like

147.599 --> 153.04
typically in autumn

153.68 --> 160.4
it's a dutch summer

157.599 --> 162.72
hello good servant first in chat good to

160.4 --> 162.72
see you

163.68 --> 185.12
uh it's friday

167.04 --> 188.79999999999998
the 2nd of july 2021

185.12 --> 188.8
let's see what this friday brings

197.04 --> 203.92
hello french sissac

201.04 --> 203.92
francis

205.12 --> 209.76
she's luck okay

210.64 --> 214.72
that's not all too easy to pronounce

214.879 --> 219.04
you from eastern europe somewhere

222.319 --> 227.83999999999997
polish right i knew it

230.48 --> 242.48
yeah welcome to the stream hello cleary

240.239 --> 244.0
yeah thanks by the way good servant if

242.48 --> 247.84
you say my last

244.0 --> 250.64
three weeks the shows have been good

247.84 --> 250.64000000000001
i hope so

252.56 --> 257.199
it's it i don't know it's a little tough

255.12 --> 258.079
for me to judge at this point i do watch

257.199 --> 262.639
some of it back

258.079 --> 265.68
and i do like watching my shows back

262.639 --> 270.0
and also in contrast to say

265.68 --> 273.28000000000003
two years ago my frequency is better

270.0 --> 276.32
and i'm very happy about that part

273.28 --> 278.96
my only personal issue is sometimes

276.32 --> 278.96
silence

281.6 --> 288.40000000000003
said long pauses but

285.28 --> 297.84
i don't know i think it it it all fits

288.4 --> 297.84
so i'm happy with my streams

298.72 --> 302.0
hey here we go again

305.039 --> 313.919
all right so yesterday

311.28 --> 315.19899999999996
there's plenty of stream yeah nathan and

313.919 --> 317.84
nathan

315.199 --> 320.639
the after show went on for like over one

317.84 --> 320.63899999999995
and a half hour

321.84 --> 328.71999999999997
like i left for groceries

325.36 --> 331.199
after the after show had already started

328.72 --> 332.72
or like or had been going on for 15

331.199 --> 334.72
minutes because it was pretty good it

332.72 --> 336.72
was all very technical

334.72 --> 339.759
then it went away and then as i came

336.72 --> 342.639
back it was still going and then kept on

339.759 --> 347.759
going for like half an hour

342.639 --> 347.759
so yeah very long thursday show

348.0 --> 354.56
i missed a chunk but yeah i'll

351.28 --> 357.11999999999995
be seeing that back on saturday pretty

354.56 --> 357.12
sure of that

364.84 --> 367.84
right

368.16 --> 372.16
right there were some other streams

369.68 --> 372.16
going on

372.24 --> 376.72
didn't really watch them watched a

374.72 --> 379.6
little bit of flat earth british

376.72 --> 380.319
but then i don't know drifted off into

379.6 --> 384.16
other stuff

380.319 --> 384.16
oh yeah i watched

384.479 --> 390.08
like the hobbit movie the second one

391.759 --> 395.84000000000003
it just popped by

396.4 --> 415.919
and i thought hey why not

409.84 --> 420.96
oh yeah yeah legolas dad

415.919 --> 420.96
is like a [Â __Â ] but that's okay

421.36 --> 423.84000000000003
uh

432.0 --> 437.84
he's still pretty convincing though

443.039 --> 447.52
and that that's a joke guys it's like i

446.479 --> 450.96
actually

447.52 --> 451.19899999999996
weirdly enough associating myself with

450.96 --> 454.56
an

451.199 --> 456.96000000000004
elf that was really a rough remark like

454.56 --> 460.4
i would never be caught

456.96 --> 465.84
by an action actual alvin king

460.4 --> 465.84
saying that uh

466.639 --> 473.199
unless he expressed some particular

471.52 --> 477.12
level of entertainment from my

473.199 --> 479.039
activities and then i might joke with it

477.12 --> 480.479
this is ridiculous there is no such

479.039 --> 485.12
thing

480.479 --> 488.15999999999997
but uh yeah watch that

485.12 --> 490.08
that was pretty cool yeah i almost i

488.16 --> 490.56
almost didn't want to start the stream

490.08 --> 493.599
because

490.56 --> 495.199
i was just watching the start of owen

493.599 --> 498.71999999999997
benjamin

495.199 --> 501.599
i also had a stream yesterday

498.72 --> 501.59900000000005
uh only just

502.879 --> 511.91900000000004
stupid dad pop-ups uh

507.599 --> 511.919
but yeah i'm gonna be live here and

512.719 --> 523.279
answer questions

520.0 --> 526.8
hello rob h good to see you ugh

523.279 --> 529.8389999999999
mark zweiler is sending me more people

526.8 --> 532.0799999999999
blabber messages literally he is being

529.839 --> 535.839
like a spambot

532.08 --> 537.519
ad he's just like oh you do this and

535.839 --> 540.399
your life would change this and your

537.519 --> 544.0
life would change i don't know

540.399 --> 546.88
how to shut him up at this point i mean

544.0 --> 546.88
can you block

547.12 --> 550.88
people in paypal

551.04 --> 556.8
uh i haven't figured out how that works

555.76 --> 560.399
but

556.8 --> 560.399
it's getting a bit on my nerves

560.72 --> 564.5600000000001
it doesn't seem to get the message that

563.36 --> 566.9590000000001
the format

564.56 --> 568.8
he is bringing it's not working i'm not

566.959 --> 572.16
gonna take his advice if he

568.8 --> 572.88
if he acts like this like never taking

572.16 --> 577.8389999999999
advice

572.88 --> 577.8389999999999
from somebody that's acting as a lunatic

579.839 --> 583.9200000000001
right maybe it was somehow routed in

583.279 --> 586.48
some good

583.92 --> 587.1999999999999
thing but he's acting like a lunatic and

586.48 --> 591.839
then

587.2 --> 591.839
so it always works out bad

594.08 --> 596.48
anyway

600.8 --> 619.8389999999999
other than that doing pretty good

605.6 --> 619.839
let's see

637.44 --> 645.44
oh good heard of the english

641.04 --> 649.1999999999999
trans woman priest non-binary

645.44 --> 652.0790000000001
representative of god sorry it's

649.2 --> 654.399
that's a terrible thing to bring up but

652.079 --> 654.399
yeah

658.839 --> 661.839
um

669.36 --> 677.36
okay well friends she's sick

673.44 --> 682.9590000000001
sorry it's gonna francis

677.36 --> 685.36
zai okay i'll just call you francis okay

682.959 --> 689.3599999999999
that part i can't pronounce yeah you

685.36 --> 692.72
came to the right place

689.36 --> 695.839
that's what i'm here for so yeah

692.72 --> 695.839
ask your questions

699.519 --> 705.2
but let me start out by asking you a

702.64 --> 709.1999999999999
question since you brought up science

705.2 --> 713.44
do you know what it is have you

709.2 --> 717.6
learned about paul buster's channel

713.44 --> 720.9590000000001
quantum eraser his presentations

717.6 --> 723.76
nathan oakley also provides the same

720.959 --> 726.88
platform pretty much

723.76 --> 730.88
and much of the same narrative right

726.88 --> 733.8389999999999
it's not a it is a narrative

730.88 --> 736.399
but it's a narrative based in logic and

733.839 --> 740.48
sound reasoning

736.399 --> 741.76
not in politics or misinformation or

740.48 --> 744.0790000000001
manipulation

741.76 --> 746.959
it's what it is the scientific method

744.079 --> 746.959
have you heard of it

757.12 --> 773.839
you heard he said what are you talking

759.04 --> 773.8389999999999
about good servant

774.639 --> 777.76
francis i hope this better not be that

777.04 --> 781.92
same

777.76 --> 781.92
old baller list of nonsense

782.8 --> 789.5999999999999
like eclipses and anti-portal star

787.279 --> 801.8389999999999
positions and

789.6 --> 801.839
oh please let it not be those questions

802.399 --> 806.88
glow busters uh did i say glow busters i

805.6 --> 810.32
meant ball busters

806.88 --> 811.4399999999999
that's like the saturday show i am part

810.32 --> 814.1600000000001
of it

811.44 --> 815.519
both shows that i mentioned i am part of

814.16 --> 819.36
it

815.519 --> 819.36
right i am on that panel

826.0 --> 831.519
how glowbusters is on

829.12 --> 834.639
sunday i think i don't know if it's

831.519 --> 834.639
still going probably

836.399 --> 840.24
right but my question was specific to

838.8 --> 843.279
the scientific method

840.24 --> 848.399
do you realize the issue

843.279 --> 851.6
with the bastardization the cultural

848.399 --> 855.6
bastardization of the word science

851.6 --> 858.8000000000001
how it's been chronically misused

855.6 --> 860.0790000000001
for quite a long time and systematically

858.8 --> 864.0
misapplied

860.079 --> 866.959
culturally through media through

864.0 --> 871.839
general talk from people that are

866.959 --> 871.8389999999999
supposed to know better

877.199 --> 883.199
talk later okay good servant

880.32 --> 885.839
well that's don't know what the hell

883.199 --> 885.8389999999999
that was for

887.92 --> 893.519
but okay talk to you later what about

890.56 --> 893.5189999999999
boats over what

896.839 --> 899.839
what

900.959 --> 914.56
daylight hours

912.16 --> 914.56
okay

917.72 --> 920.779
[Music]

926.05 --> 931.41
[Music]

929.839 --> 934.8800000000001
right so so what about it

931.41 --> 937.36
[Music]

934.88 --> 938.639
yeah different daylight times in

937.36 --> 942.32
different regions

938.639 --> 942.32
in different periods of the year

944.399 --> 955.839
what's the issue

978.48 --> 986.16
right uh yeah concerning the north pole

982.8 --> 989.199
as a point it's not there

986.16 --> 992.48
nobody ever goes there and like actually

989.199 --> 994.639
is at the exact north pole so the north

992.48 --> 998.0790000000001
pole is mostly a region

994.639 --> 1000.92
the region most north and that is the

998.079 --> 1004.3199999999999
region where there is

1000.92 --> 1006.959
24-hour daylight or nighttime

1004.32 --> 1010.0790000000001
experiences

1006.959 --> 1025.839
based on the time of the year that's the

1010.079 --> 1025.839
region that's not a point

1036.839 --> 1041.36
hey

1038.079 --> 1044.24
wait are you asking why is there

1041.36 --> 1044.8799999999999
one point on earth 24-hour sun when

1044.24 --> 1047.76
there is

1044.88 --> 1048.72
24-hour night at the same time on

1047.76 --> 1053.84
another point

1048.72 --> 1053.84
on the earth is that your question

1078.84 --> 1081.84
hmm

1088.64 --> 1096.48
okay now wait

1093.039 --> 1097.84
yeah yeah the apps does help although it

1096.48 --> 1101.3600000000001
is all disk based

1097.84 --> 1101.36
you know you could basically

1103.2 --> 1108.559
reproject the land in a rectangular

1106.4 --> 1112.4
fashion with the same app

1108.559 --> 1115.039
and instead of on a disk

1112.4 --> 1115.8400000000001
it would be a rectangular screen and

1115.039 --> 1117.84
then you would see

1115.84 --> 1118.8799999999999
the position of the sun and the moon or

1117.84 --> 1122.48
you could center

1118.88 --> 1125.8400000000001
around them and make

1122.48 --> 1128.799
the map in a looping fashion

1125.84 --> 1129.52
scroll instead of the celestials however

1128.799 --> 1132.799
yeah right

1129.52 --> 1135.36
side like the uh square earth cosmology

1132.799 --> 1136.0
videos like they do it you could do that

1135.36 --> 1138.1599999999999
with an app

1136.0 --> 1141.6
as well would be pretty much the same

1138.16 --> 1141.6000000000001
thing just another projection

1143.039 --> 1150.16
right so it's not that disk

1146.4 --> 1153.679
which would be a yeah thing that's not

1150.16 --> 1153.679
entirely certain if that's

1162.84 --> 1165.84
euclidean

1167.039 --> 1170.96
try again in one what why would you

1170.48 --> 1174.24
assume

1170.96 --> 1174.24
you're not wording it well

1175.76 --> 1180.8799999999999
what is the issue

1179.2 --> 1184.4
right you don't have to be super

1180.88 --> 1188.3200000000002
specific with like island names and

1184.4 --> 1190.48
all that i don't really know them

1188.32 --> 1192.559
just say okay this is just very much

1190.48 --> 1195.919
north very much south

1192.559 --> 1199.76
very much near to the equator right

1195.919 --> 1199.76
you don't have to be super specific

1202.72 --> 1206.88
at least i believe you wouldn't unless

1205.44 --> 1209.919
this is some kind of a math

1206.88 --> 1209.919
detail question

1216.48 --> 1221.84
right norway

1229.12 --> 1231.6789999999999
williams

1232.96 --> 1239.28
further from the sun

1236.24 --> 1242.64
in the flat earth

1239.28 --> 1246.32
uh no

1242.64 --> 1250.0
what do you mean further from closer to

1246.32 --> 1252.8799999999999
further from the sun are you saying that

1250.0 --> 1255.2
the sun is a physical object that is

1252.88 --> 1257.8400000000001
literally in a euclidean position

1255.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
hovering over a disk

1257.84 --> 1263.84
because that is a misconception

1279.039 --> 1282.08
closer to what

1287.84 --> 1292.0
look from the data francis that you've

1291.36 --> 1295.28
put out

1292.0 --> 1297.12
within your questioning it's already

1295.28 --> 1300.72
becoming apparent to me that you

1297.12 --> 1305.6
are having euclidean

1300.72 --> 1309.2
issues right with the map projection

1305.6 --> 1312.32
disk map projection

1309.2 --> 1314.0800000000002
so you're assuming wait there's light

1312.32 --> 1316.48
here light there

1314.08 --> 1317.36
this is where the disk projection says

1316.48 --> 1319.84
the sun is

1317.36 --> 1319.84
but why

1320.799 --> 1328.0
is it not literally there

1323.84 --> 1328.0
yeah because it isn't literally there

1329.12 --> 1332.2399999999998
the sun is not a physical object it's

1331.919 --> 1334.64
not

1332.24 --> 1337.2
in a literal position it's a light

1334.64 --> 1337.2
manifest

1340.72 --> 1345.44
that's right it doesn't have it's worse

1342.799 --> 1349.52
than not a definitive position

1345.44 --> 1349.52
it doesn't have an actual position

1350.08 --> 1357.4399999999998
it's not a physical object it's a

1353.52 --> 1360.1589999999999
manifestation or

1357.44 --> 1360.72
from my perception from what i've

1360.159 --> 1364.48
gathered

1360.72 --> 1365.919
so far the sun is not even primary it's

1364.48 --> 1369.3600000000001
a side effect

1365.919 --> 1369.3600000000001
of the light manifest

1370.159 --> 1374.24
so it's not coming from this bright disc

1373.12 --> 1376.1589999999999
no the bright disc

1374.24 --> 1378.799
is a side effect of looking straight

1376.159 --> 1383.8400000000001
towards

1378.799 --> 1383.84
the angular manifest of daylight

1384.08 --> 1387.52
and the same goes with all the other

1385.52 --> 1391.12
celestials

1387.52 --> 1391.12
although they are not as intense

1398.4 --> 1401.8400000000001
where does the light come from well

1400.32 --> 1404.24
nobody really

1401.84 --> 1405.12
knows or understands that right people

1404.24 --> 1407.679
attempt to

1405.12 --> 1407.6789999999999
model it

1408.24 --> 1414.96
right try to

1411.36 --> 1415.4399999999998
find an explanation but it's all based

1414.96 --> 1418.64
in

1415.44 --> 1422.3200000000002
in just physical euclidean

1418.64 --> 1423.5200000000002
position based things or they talk about

1422.32 --> 1426.3999999999999
mirrors

1423.52 --> 1428.0
without any real evidence for that

1426.4 --> 1429.279
either because with a mirror they're

1428.0 --> 1432.4
still proximities

1429.279 --> 1444.32
even through the virtually added space

1432.4 --> 1446.88
through the reflector so

1444.32 --> 1448.24
we don't know exactly where the light

1446.88 --> 1451.7600000000002
comes from

1448.24 --> 1454.159
we just know it manifests in a specific

1451.76 --> 1456.24
angular relation to the position on

1454.159 --> 1459.7600000000002
earth

1456.24 --> 1462.72
there's a distinct oscillating pattern

1459.76 --> 1462.72
to the whole of it

1463.12 --> 1468.6399999999999
but you can't really pinpoint any of the

1466.64 --> 1471.919
celestials you can't

1468.64 --> 1472.3200000000002
reach them approach them move closer and

1471.919 --> 1475.76
then

1472.32 --> 1478.72
have the perception of this angular size

1475.76 --> 1480.64
increase of the celestial bodies and

1478.72 --> 1484.799
that includes the moon

1480.64 --> 1486.88
which is supposedly very close right

1484.799 --> 1489.279
there's no angular size increase when

1486.88 --> 1492.7990000000002
you attempt to approach

1489.279 --> 1496.4
their virtual euclidean position assumed

1492.799 --> 1499.84
based on a model triangulation right

1496.4 --> 1501.919
so there's no evidence that they are

1499.84 --> 1504.48
physical or that you can actually

1501.919 --> 1505.3600000000001
measure a literal distance to them any

1504.48 --> 1508.48
of them

1505.36 --> 1510.0
right that is like a really mind-blowing

1508.48 --> 1512.84
detail

1510.0 --> 1514.64
that nobody really likes to deal with

1512.84 --> 1516.48
because

1514.64 --> 1518.88
when somebody's listening and then

1516.48 --> 1521.3600000000001
trying to

1518.88 --> 1523.0390000000002
educate themselves on reality yeah it

1521.36 --> 1524.9599999999998
presents like a giant gap

1523.039 --> 1526.08
like yeah there's something we really

1524.96 --> 1528.88
don't know

1526.08 --> 1529.76
well that makes people feel stupid i

1528.88 --> 1532.279
guess

1529.76 --> 1533.76
so they then would rather choose for a

1532.279 --> 1536.0
reification

1533.76 --> 1538.4
where they just claim it's physical in

1536.0 --> 1540.799
some way in some place

1538.4 --> 1541.6000000000001
so they can continue the story and not

1540.799 --> 1543.52
be

1541.6 --> 1545.4399999999998
forced to present like yeah there's a

1543.52 --> 1547.84
giant gap in in

1545.44 --> 1550.0800000000002
in our understanding here and that's not

1547.84 --> 1550.9599999999998
because we're stupid or uninformed it's

1550.08 --> 1553.1999999999998
because

1550.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
it's really complicated and most people

1553.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
don't want to deal with it

1563.2 --> 1567.8400000000001
photons are energy oh really

1568.4 --> 1574.0800000000002
photon is a model but yeah light is

1571.279 --> 1576.799
energy indeed

1574.08 --> 1577.1999999999998
where's the source for all the energy

1576.799 --> 1581.279
well

1577.2 --> 1584.72
the source would be the energy

1581.279 --> 1587.039
i mean energy through matter manifests

1584.72 --> 1591.1200000000001
light

1587.039 --> 1594.4
electricity creates light in matter

1591.12 --> 1594.3999999999999
we know it as a lamp

1595.039 --> 1600.32
so where i think if i had to

1598.08 --> 1601.9189999999999
would be forced to basically model

1600.32 --> 1605.12
together some kind of energy

1601.919 --> 1607.44
circuit that sustains it all then i'd

1605.12 --> 1610.7199999999998
say that the celestials are

1607.44 --> 1614.0800000000002
electric in origin

1610.72 --> 1616.32
but not in a straightforward setup that

1614.08 --> 1618.08
we would typically

1616.32 --> 1619.9189999999999
be able to understand in order to

1618.08 --> 1622.0
recreate it

1619.919 --> 1625.679
there's something weird going on in the

1622.0 --> 1629.12
way this light is manifesting

1625.679 --> 1633.52
and it's so persistent and eternal so

1629.12 --> 1633.52
there is it's a big puzzle

1633.76 --> 1637.44
but yeah since there is light

1635.44 --> 1640.799
manifesting it's literally

1637.44 --> 1643.919
changing the dynamics within the realm

1640.799 --> 1644.799
through the heat that means there is

1643.919 --> 1647.279
energy

1644.799 --> 1647.279
moving

1647.84 --> 1652.399
and that energy would have to come from

1652.84 --> 1655.84
somewhere

1656.24 --> 1663.679
but it's not coming from a a

1659.44 --> 1665.279
pinpoint position physical generator

1663.679 --> 1666.64
it's not like oh the light is all coming

1665.279 --> 1669.76
from this one point

1666.64 --> 1672.96
in physical space no

1669.76 --> 1677.12
it's just manifesting

1672.96 --> 1680.3990000000001
angular wise locally everywhere it's it

1677.12 --> 1680.399
yeah it's like

1680.64 --> 1690.0800000000002
a rough comparison the entire gas body

1684.96 --> 1693.76
within the realm is the lamp

1690.08 --> 1697.039
but really fractal and weird and motion

1693.76 --> 1698.799
full that yeah you know

1697.039 --> 1700.72
when you have a lamp there's a gas in

1698.799 --> 1704.72
the lamp the gas is a

1700.72 --> 1707.2
near function to it to how it works

1704.72 --> 1708.24
well consider that the entire realm

1707.2 --> 1712.32
enclosure

1708.24 --> 1712.32
would be the lamp's gas

1712.799 --> 1716.96
now of course there's not a wire

1714.72 --> 1720.159
somewhere to actually

1716.96 --> 1722.48
yeah make that lamp into a euclidean

1720.159 --> 1722.48
lamp

1722.84 --> 1727.6789999999999
but

1724.48 --> 1730.96
there is plenty of gas

1727.679 --> 1730.96
there is electricity

1731.6 --> 1734.6399999999999
so yeah in that sense the realm already

1733.919 --> 1738.64
has

1734.64 --> 1741.5200000000002
plenty of elements to suffice

1738.64 --> 1742.24
the engineering principles of a of a

1741.52 --> 1745.36
lamp

1742.24 --> 1745.36
an electric lamp

1749.039 --> 1766.399
is gas not mass what uh

1752.799 --> 1770.08
what does that have to do with it

1766.399 --> 1773.12
how does it have tidal

1770.08 --> 1773.12
effects what

1773.919 --> 1779.3600000000001
how does the sun have tidal effects do

1775.84 --> 1779.36
you have any evidence for this

1779.84 --> 1783.4399999999998
what the the sun

1784.159 --> 1789.0390000000002
i i think you mean the moon because in

1787.159 --> 1792.8400000000001
heliocentrism it is

1789.039 --> 1794.08
claimed the moon causes the tides on

1792.84 --> 1797.12
earth

1794.08 --> 1800.72
but this is even

1797.12 --> 1805.039
geometrically ridiculous

1800.72 --> 1808.799
tides are caused by angel spoons locally

1805.039 --> 1810.8799999999999
and two or three times a day

1808.799 --> 1814.08
that has nothing to do with the

1810.88 --> 1817.6000000000001
presupposed trajectory of the moon

1814.08 --> 1820.96
it's ridiculous like even

1817.6 --> 1823.9599999999998
in mainstream representations it's

1820.96 --> 1825.919
shown like yeah if it would be like what

1823.96 --> 1827.8400000000001
heliocentrism says it does

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
then there would be a giant bulge of

1827.84 --> 1831.039
ocean constantly pulled around the

1829.84 --> 1834.84
equator

1831.039 --> 1837.84
this is ridiculous that's not what's

1834.84 --> 1837.84
happening

1841.44 --> 1844.88
okay are you still able to follow what

1843.76 --> 1848.559
i'm talking about

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
i know i probably put your mind into

1848.559 --> 1851.84
unfamiliar territory

1867.2 --> 1874.559
no no they don't francis

1870.88 --> 1876.96
you have no evidence for this at all

1874.559 --> 1878.24
you cannot prove there's even a

1876.96 --> 1881.519
correlation

1878.24 --> 1882.32
between the tides and the sun and the

1881.519 --> 1886.64
moon's

1882.32 --> 1886.6399999999999
angular position on the earth

1887.84 --> 1892.08
it's not without dispute it is it is

1890.48 --> 1895.3600000000001
without dispute that there is

1892.08 --> 1898.32
no evidence for this whatsoever not even

1895.36 --> 1898.9599999999998
correlative evidence okay nothing

1898.32 --> 1902.24
there's

1898.96 --> 1904.72
nothing unless you would like to present

1902.24 --> 1905.84
anything other than just so stories that

1904.72 --> 1908.08
make the claim

1905.84 --> 1910.0
without the evidence because there's

1908.08 --> 1912.32
plenty of that out there

1910.0 --> 1915.12
but there's no actual evidence not even

1912.32 --> 1915.12
correlatory

1916.0 --> 1920.12
like the modeling doesn't even make any

1918.84 --> 1923.25
sense

1920.12 --> 1923.25
[Music]

1925.12 --> 1929.76
not seeking star wars it might simply be

1927.36 --> 1932.4799999999998
just acting out

1929.76 --> 1932.48
conditioning

1932.96 --> 1938.64
i think it's just conditioning

1936.32 --> 1940.96
oh few sources then no i don't need

1938.64 --> 1942.64
sources to just show stories that make

1940.96 --> 1945.1200000000001
the claim and do not provide the

1942.64 --> 1948.3200000000002
evidence or

1945.12 --> 1948.9599999999998
bridge the giant gap in correlatory

1948.32 --> 1952.08
evidence

1948.96 --> 1956.48
even so no i've seen

1952.08 --> 1956.48
all of that it makes no sense

1956.559 --> 1960.799
doesn't matter you can provide me with

1958.559 --> 1962.799
10 sources saying the same crap in

1960.799 --> 1966.32
different ways over and over again

1962.799 --> 1969.9189999999999
none of them will have actual evidence

1966.32 --> 1977.84
it's all just so stories i know this

1969.919 --> 1977.8400000000001
i've been doing this for six years

1982.159 --> 1988.0
so you got anything else francis

1985.76 --> 1988.799
i mean are you trying to understand

1988.0 --> 1992.159
something here

1988.799 --> 1994.799
or are you just trying to reinforce your

1992.159 --> 1994.7990000000002
conditioning

1997.84 --> 2005.9189999999999
if i can find one that provides the

2000.919 --> 2008.88
observation the observation of what

2005.919 --> 2009.3600000000001
of a moon or a sun being in the sky and

2008.88 --> 2011.7600000000002
then

2009.36 --> 2013.84
a tide happening somewhere and that's

2011.76 --> 2015.84
supposed to prove that it causes the

2013.84 --> 2019.84
tides

2015.84 --> 2019.84
makes no sense

2020.799 --> 2024.1589999999999
that literally makes no sense there's no

2023.2 --> 2027.6000000000001
forces

2024.159 --> 2032.24
being measured there is no

2027.6 --> 2034.9599999999998
indication of any palpable data

2032.24 --> 2035.84
concerning the sun and the moon that

2034.96 --> 2040.08
would

2035.84 --> 2042.72
somehow indicate that it pulls water

2040.08 --> 2043.6789999999999
okay salt water there's no indication

2042.72 --> 2047.84
that it is

2043.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
the cause of it

2054.879 --> 2061.839
shut up nigel wanker

2082.48 --> 2090.399
do you understand physics francis

2088.32 --> 2092.079
you understand that if you're going to

2090.399 --> 2095.1189999999997
point at a

2092.079 --> 2098.7200000000003
palpable physical phenomenon

2095.119 --> 2100.839
in the world like tides

2098.72 --> 2102.16
and there's physical displacement

2100.839 --> 2105.4
happening

2102.16 --> 2110.56
that you're going to have to provide a a

2105.4 --> 2114.8
palpable measurable chain of events

2110.56 --> 2118.72
of forces of mechanics

2114.8 --> 2122.7200000000003
in order to establish the cause for it

2118.72 --> 2122.72
right i i tried to point that out

2123.04 --> 2127.839
right there's actually a body of salt

2125.599 --> 2128.7200000000003
water displacing that's gonna have to

2127.839 --> 2131.68
actually be

2128.72 --> 2132.72
palpable otherwise how can something not

2131.68 --> 2137.68
palpable

2132.72 --> 2137.68
cause a body of water to this place yeah

2137.839 --> 2146.24
now seeing specific lights in the sky

2143.119 --> 2147.44
when that happens does not provide a

2146.24 --> 2151.52
chain

2147.44 --> 2159.839
link of events and mechanics that could

2151.52 --> 2159.839
cause that

2160.96 --> 2166.4
i'm not letting you provide what are you

2163.76 --> 2166.4
talking about

2166.72 --> 2170.7999999999997
you're here in chat aren't you how can i

2170.079 --> 2174.32
stop you

2170.8 --> 2176.7200000000003
from providing the evidence i'm just

2174.32 --> 2178.48
giving you forewarning of what you're

2176.72 --> 2181.9199999999996
gonna attempt and why i know

2178.48 --> 2184.079
it's gonna fail i've been there

2181.92 --> 2185.2000000000003
right i'm not stopping you you wanna do

2184.079 --> 2187.119
it do it

2185.2 --> 2188.56
right there it's there in check i'm not

2187.119 --> 2193.04
stopping you

2188.56 --> 2193.04
i'm just telling you this is pointless

2194.8 --> 2200.7200000000003
doesn't mean that you can't try you know

2198.4 --> 2203.28
just trying to point out why this is not

2200.72 --> 2203.2799999999997
gonna work

2209.18 --> 2215.839
[Music]

2210.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
hey seeking star wars

2225.52 --> 2229.839
no good servant

2245.04 --> 2257.839
that's a really silly conclusion to draw

2262.64 --> 2267.52
you're getting messages in your heart to

2264.32 --> 2267.52
step away one agent

2268.56 --> 2273.599
all right i'm talking to a good servant

2274.88 --> 2279.839
that's my tight explanation with cr what

2280.32 --> 2287.3590000000004
oh hmm okay okay

2284.32 --> 2290.1600000000003
yeah yeah

2287.359 --> 2291.92
that's actually a pretty good example of

2290.16 --> 2295.1189999999997
a similar

2291.92 --> 2295.839
false conclusion based just a story yeah

2295.119 --> 2297.92
yeah that's

2295.839 --> 2299.04
i i appreciate that good servant well

2297.92 --> 2313.839
done

2299.04 --> 2313.839
it is a good comparison

2315.119 --> 2322.0
well why don't you just stop asking

2318.32 --> 2324.2400000000002
what do this what do that what and just

2322.0 --> 2326.32
you were making a claim and just provide

2324.24 --> 2328.72
your evidence and then i will scrutinize

2326.32 --> 2332.48
your evidence

2328.72 --> 2334.56
it's no need to ask me on how to present

2332.48 --> 2341.839
the evidence i already gave you

2334.56 --> 2341.839
everything you need to know about it

2352.839 --> 2355.839
francis

2364.76 --> 2369.8390000000004
[Music]

2366.839 --> 2369.839
uh

2404.88 --> 2409.04
yeah that's all very meta you're not

2406.72 --> 2411.9199999999996
providing any evidence

2409.04 --> 2412.64
i i don't need to know on how you would

2411.92 --> 2415.119
provide

2412.64 --> 2417.5989999999997
evidence i just want you to provide

2415.119 --> 2417.599
evidence

2419.599 --> 2424.6400000000003
and i don't care about blame games or

2422.16 --> 2427.5989999999997
your worries about those yeah

2424.64 --> 2429.839
just provide the evidence or admit you

2427.599 --> 2432.2400000000002
don't have any

2429.839 --> 2432.88
you just have just her stories none of

2432.24 --> 2436.319
which

2432.88 --> 2439.76
actually contain evidence

2436.319 --> 2442.24
that is empirical in nature or even make

2439.76 --> 2443.6800000000003
a solid claim on the chain of events

2442.24 --> 2446.72
mechanically

2443.68 --> 2447.1189999999997
involving the tides okay because none of

2446.72 --> 2449.359
them

2447.119 --> 2449.359
do

2450.23 --> 2454.56
[Music]

2451.76 --> 2457.0400000000004
right and they all involve gravity based

2454.56 --> 2458.96
on newtonian mechanics which is already

2457.04 --> 2461.04
officially denied

2458.96 --> 2462.96
because that's not even what gravity is

2461.04 --> 2464.8
anymore even though the entire solar

2462.96 --> 2468.48
system mechanics are still based on it

2464.8 --> 2468.48
which is completely ludicrous

2469.599 --> 2474.319
it's a crazy world out there if you

2471.52 --> 2474.319
believe in the globe

2478.839 --> 2495.839
francis get to a point

2482.0 --> 2495.839
or get banned

2498.0 --> 2503.04
all right i do appreciate his input by

2500.16 --> 2503.04
the way you know

2505.92 --> 2509.76
but i don't have unlimited patience for

2508.56 --> 2513.04
for just

2509.76 --> 2513.0400000000004
people that stall

2516.24 --> 2523.839
that is annoying

2535.119 --> 2539.2000000000003
all right so now he's actually going to

2537.359 --> 2540.0
look for the evidence isn't that just

2539.2 --> 2542.0
cute

2540.0 --> 2544.56
isn't that just typical first you make

2542.0 --> 2544.56
the claim

2544.72 --> 2548.72
then you assume you're going to win

2546.24 --> 2552.24
because you know how to uphold the story

2548.72 --> 2554.48
then somebody tests you on that

2552.24 --> 2557.2
and then you suddenly have to actually

2554.48 --> 2558.56
figure out the details of the story that

2557.2 --> 2562.0789999999997
you championed

2558.56 --> 2564.72
oh let me look it up why

2562.079 --> 2566.6400000000003
because you didn't really look into it

2564.72 --> 2569.359
before

2566.64 --> 2570.0
none of them do ballers don't do that

2569.359 --> 2573.119
you're not

2570.0 --> 2573.119
trained to do that

2573.52 --> 2578.079
you're just trained to explain not to

2575.839 --> 2581.2
read the details not to critically think

2578.079 --> 2581.2000000000003
about the details

2584.16 --> 2588.3999999999996
but yeah this is just a typical

2586.64 --> 2593.839
situation

2588.4 --> 2593.839
we'll see what he comes back with

2594.64 --> 2598.5
[Music]

2605.599 --> 2611.04
yeah that's silly well you know if you

2607.76 --> 2613.92
don't know then you'll shut up

2611.04 --> 2614.48
you don't necessarily have to do that

2613.92 --> 2618.16
you know

2614.48 --> 2621.52
if you're not going to be zealous

2618.16 --> 2624.16
and you just act adaptively

2621.52 --> 2625.44
then you can make a claim about

2624.16 --> 2627.68
something

2625.44 --> 2629.2000000000003
without necessarily reading into the

2627.68 --> 2632.3999999999996
details of it first

2629.2 --> 2634.96
just by bringing it up because you know

2632.4 --> 2638.2400000000002
when something comes up

2634.96 --> 2640.2400000000002
that could be pretty random that moment

2638.24 --> 2641.68
so it does mean like oh something just

2640.24 --> 2643.7599999999998
came up with me i need to

2641.68 --> 2645.2799999999997
in detail research a lot of things now

2643.76 --> 2647.8390000000004
before i start talking about it no

2645.28 --> 2650.4
no no you can bring something up but

2647.839 --> 2653.7599999999998
then you also need to expect

2650.4 --> 2656.56
that you might make a mistake about it

2653.76 --> 2658.2400000000002
and if somebody then correct you in that

2656.56 --> 2661.04
mistake

2658.24 --> 2665.04
then you need to adapt if it actually is

2661.04 --> 2665.04
a real mistake and not just gaslighting

2665.28 --> 2669.8390000000004
right and if you do that then there's no

2667.44 --> 2669.839
problem

2670.24 --> 2674.3999999999996
right admitting to a mistake is all

2672.8 --> 2679.599
about progress

2674.4 --> 2683.6800000000003
that's what really makes progress

2679.599 --> 2686.2400000000002
and it's very relieving to just do that

2683.68 --> 2687.5989999999997
just say oh this and this this right and

2686.24 --> 2690.56
then somebody else

2687.599 --> 2691.52
no almost but you got this wrong and i'm

2690.56 --> 2695.04
like ah

2691.52 --> 2697.7599999999998
all right now i know and guess what i

2695.04 --> 2698.24
might make that mistake again sometime

2697.76 --> 2700.48
later

2698.24 --> 2701.839
especially if i've been through a lot in

2700.48 --> 2705.599
in between

2701.839 --> 2706.64
but eventually i will stop then making

2705.599 --> 2708.56
that mistake

2706.64 --> 2709.839
and i no longer have to be corrected

2708.56 --> 2714.24
because the correct

2709.839 --> 2714.24
the correction has settled

2715.44 --> 2724.56
and then you really learned it

2719.839 --> 2724.56
this is how i learn complicated things

2726.48 --> 2734.079
complicated procedures by constantly

2730.96 --> 2736.2400000000002
trying it out making mistakes but not

2734.079 --> 2738.319
be afraid of the mistakes sometimes you

2736.24 --> 2739.359
need to make the mistakes in order to

2738.319 --> 2742.8
perfect

2739.359 --> 2744.64
the actual actions because if you know

2742.8 --> 2747.119
what mistakes could happen

2744.64 --> 2747.92
then you can take that spiritually into

2747.119 --> 2750.88
account

2747.92 --> 2760.7200000000003
in the full dynamics of the action as

2750.88 --> 2762.7200000000003
you perform it

2760.72 --> 2764.24
ah life is all about correcting your

2762.72 --> 2767.2799999999997
mistakes

2764.24 --> 2768.7999999999997
and so is sin it's basically the same

2767.28 --> 2772.96
story

2768.8 --> 2777.28
different playbook same story

2772.96 --> 2781.44
science logos

2777.28 --> 2781.44
the same playbook different story

2784.4 --> 2789.76
[Music]

2787.44 --> 2791.04
hey clutch bear gary van gaal hey dan

2789.76 --> 2794.4
winfield

2791.04 --> 2795.44
long time no see then wow dan winfield

2794.4 --> 2798.64
and me go

2795.44 --> 2798.64
back way back

2801.599 --> 2805.2000000000003
like five years or something

2810.079 --> 2817.8390000000004
how are you doing man i hope you stayed

2813.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
clear of the facts

2822.0 --> 2827.359
is it dan winfield or are you just

2824.079 --> 2827.3590000000004
another w

2827.92 --> 2831.839
i don't know

2846.0 --> 2849.359
right that [Â __Â ] thank you i appreciate

2848.24 --> 2859.839
that indeed

2849.359 --> 2859.839
i will not be bribed to say [Â __Â ]

2860.88 --> 2865.44
right i have i have enough to say i

2863.839 --> 2869.52
don't

2865.44 --> 2873.839
need to add to my repertoire

2869.52 --> 2873.839
of saying things

2874.48 --> 2877.359
i appreciate it

2883.68 --> 2885.9199999999996
what

2888.88 --> 2898.0
you can be oh you want to come over

2893.119 --> 2898.0
okay sure we could do that sometime why

2898.839 --> 2901.839
not

2909.76 --> 2912.1600000000003
okay

2912.96 --> 2919.92
yes you can rwf

2917.359 --> 2919.92
romno

2923.52 --> 2929.839
still waiting for francis though

2941.2 --> 2944.24
ah he's back

2952.96 --> 2959.359
correspond they correspond

2956.16 --> 2962.24
with it are you saying

2959.359 --> 2963.7599999999998
the tides and the sun and moon cycles

2962.24 --> 2967.04
right back

2963.76 --> 2971.28
and forth letters i didn't know they had

2967.04 --> 2974.64
like male communication

2971.28 --> 2974.6400000000003
that's really fascinating

2978.079 --> 2982.8390000000004
yeah and i'm making a a joke about it i

2981.52 --> 2987.599
know

2982.839 --> 2987.599
because correspond

2987.76 --> 2995.2000000000003
how how do they correspond

2991.68 --> 2997.44
you mean oh there is

2995.2 --> 2998.64
some kind of cyclical nature and you

2997.44 --> 3001.28
could sort of

2998.64 --> 3003.2
put these cyclical natures just because

3001.28 --> 3005.2000000000003
they are cyclical of the tides

3003.2 --> 3007.1189999999997
next to that and then oh yeah they're

3005.2 --> 3010.64
both cyclical oh

3007.119 --> 3013.6800000000003
no they correspond do they uh

3010.64 --> 3014.24
how does that prove it has anything to

3013.68 --> 3018.96
do with it

3014.24 --> 3022.9599999999996
whatsoever how do these corresponding

3018.96 --> 3026.64
cycles lay a causal

3022.96 --> 3027.68
mechanical chain link the celestial

3026.64 --> 3030.64
bodies

3027.68 --> 3033.04
and actual physical activity that

3030.64 --> 3037.44
displaces the ocean

3033.04 --> 3040.96
called tides where is that

3037.44 --> 3043.44
in in your what you looked up

3040.96 --> 3043.44
francis

3047.599 --> 3053.119
i mean am i overlooking something guys

3050.72 --> 3055.839
i thought it was was pretty specific you

3053.119 --> 3055.839
know

3081.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
okay dutch seder take it easy

3108.839 --> 3111.839
ugh

3120.96 --> 3129.2
oh that that should be easy pam cow

3125.599 --> 3132.319
the more stuff is dissolved

3129.2 --> 3133.839
in water the heavier it becomes the more

3132.319 --> 3137.44
dense it becomes

3133.839 --> 3141.2
when it's saturated it's top weight

3137.44 --> 3143.44
so yeah of course we human beings

3141.2 --> 3144.8799999999997
we are not just literally a balloon skin

3143.44 --> 3147.2000000000003
filled with water

3144.88 --> 3148.0
not even just salt oceanic water no no

3147.2 --> 3151.2
no we got

3148.0 --> 3154.319
lots of stuff dissolved in that water so

3151.2 --> 3154.319
of course we're heavier

3163.839 --> 3169.92
but yeah we can also store gas in our

3167.44 --> 3171.76
body in a very specific cavity it's

3169.92 --> 3174.7200000000003
called the lungs

3171.76 --> 3177.0400000000004
you can keep air in there and thereby

3174.72 --> 3180.24
displacing the average density

3177.04 --> 3184.079
and that helps us to float

3180.24 --> 3186.319
and hey if we go swim in super saiyan

3184.079 --> 3189.76
water that's like

3186.319 --> 3192.88
filled to the brink of sellabili

3189.76 --> 3195.5200000000004
solubility then you

3192.88 --> 3196.079
wouldn't even need to breathe in to stay

3195.52 --> 3197.44
afloat

3196.079 --> 3200.079
because the water is going to be more

3197.44 --> 3200.079
dense than you

3203.68 --> 3208.0
anyway uh let's see if there's some

3207.04 --> 3210.72
progression with

3208.0 --> 3210.72
francis here

3211.28 --> 3220.6400000000003
blind denial provided statistics to show

3216.72 --> 3220.64
the cycles cycles

3220.839 --> 3228.16
okay no no it

3225.04 --> 3229.2799999999997
how is it blind or not i did i deny did

3228.16 --> 3234.24
i deny that there

3229.28 --> 3237.28
are some yeah cyclical natures to both

3234.24 --> 3240.3999999999996
celestial sightings

3237.28 --> 3243.3590000000004
as well as the title function

3240.4 --> 3244.7200000000003
yeah yeah they are both cyclical i know

3243.359 --> 3248.64
did i deny that

3244.72 --> 3251.52
no i just merely pointed out

3248.64 --> 3253.2
that you didn't provide a mechanical

3251.52 --> 3256.96
causal chain link

3253.2 --> 3261.2799999999997
between the two in order to tell us

3256.96 --> 3261.28
how they cause it

3261.359 --> 3265.7599999999998
cause and effect the effect being the

3263.92 --> 3267.839
tides water being pushed around

3265.76 --> 3268.96
where's the causal chain link how does

3267.839 --> 3272.24
it actually

3268.96 --> 3274.8
do that physically right where is it

3272.24 --> 3276.4799999999996
in your explanation francis i haven't

3274.8 --> 3278.7200000000003
seen it

3276.48 --> 3280.4
not the first time not now you just seem

3278.72 --> 3283.839
to be complaining about

3280.4 --> 3285.76
my interpretation of your evidence

3283.839 --> 3287.92
which obviously lacks the actual

3285.76 --> 3290.7990000000004
evidence that is required to prove a

3287.92 --> 3290.799
causal relation

3291.76 --> 3296.88
or at least to attempt to figure out a

3295.2 --> 3297.839
causal relationship because that doesn't

3296.88 --> 3299.44
seem to be there

3297.839 --> 3301.2799999999997
it's just like oh no no there's just

3299.44 --> 3303.839
these cycles of lights

3301.28 --> 3304.6400000000003
and then there's the cycle of the tides

3303.839 --> 3306.5589999999997
so

3304.64 --> 3308.0789999999997
yeah they both cycle that means one

3306.559 --> 3311.2000000000003
causes the other

3308.079 --> 3314.319
yeah but how how does it do that

3311.2 --> 3317.4399999999996
how did you measure that

3314.319 --> 3318.799
how did you actually figure out that

3317.44 --> 3322.16
they

3318.799 --> 3322.16
mechanically do that

3322.88 --> 3326.559
what's the framework for this what's the

3324.48 --> 3334.0
structure you don't seem to be

3326.559 --> 3337.6800000000003
presenting it

3334.0 --> 3340.88
mass affects other bodies of mass

3337.68 --> 3346.0
where are you getting that from

3340.88 --> 3346.0
i don't think so that's ridiculous

3346.24 --> 3351.9199999999996
that's not even officially claimed mass

3348.72 --> 3351.9199999999996
doesn't attract mass

3354.16 --> 3360.24
it's gravity yeah yeah it's outdated

3358.079 --> 3361.44
it's been outdated for more than 80

3360.24 --> 3365.68
years

3361.44 --> 3365.68
is it 100 years a very long time

3366.48 --> 3370.72
right that's not gravity newtonian

3369.04 --> 3374.64
mechanics are disproven

3370.72 --> 3376.72
officially they're only a model

3374.64 --> 3379.1189999999997
for conceptual training newtonian

3376.72 --> 3379.7599999999998
mechanics is only a model for conceptual

3379.119 --> 3382.559
trading

3379.76 --> 3383.8390000000004
also you might want to look into the

3382.559 --> 3386.4
history

3383.839 --> 3388.0789999999997
of what he did and said he wrote a

3386.4 --> 3391.2000000000003
letter to a colleague

3388.079 --> 3393.8390000000004
outraged over how people would

3391.2 --> 3394.5589999999997
assume that he would actually have the

3393.839 --> 3398.319
gall

3394.559 --> 3401.44
to claim a hypothesis over gravitation

3398.319 --> 3404.72
he adamantly rejected that notion

3401.44 --> 3405.119
elaborately in a letter because he did

3404.72 --> 3408.3999999999996
not

3405.119 --> 3411.119
believe in gravitation he didn't

3408.4 --> 3411.92
it was purely conceptual and he didn't

3411.119 --> 3415.76
want to be

3411.92 --> 3418.7200000000003
part of any reification about it

3415.76 --> 3420.96
yeah so yeah gravity is not mass

3418.72 --> 3423.9199999999996
attracting mass

3420.96 --> 3423.92
it's outdated

3424.799 --> 3429.599
right there's no actual evidence for it

3427.28 --> 3429.599
either

3430.839 --> 3433.839
right

3435.76 --> 3439.44
right so there we go again you i guess

3438.64 --> 3441.04
assumed

3439.44 --> 3443.359
gravity would do it isn't that just

3441.04 --> 3444.88
beautiful you have a correlation you

3443.359 --> 3446.24
have lights in the sky they have a

3444.88 --> 3447.76
cyclical pattern

3446.24 --> 3449.52
then you have the tides they have a

3447.76 --> 3452.559
cyclical pattern

3449.52 --> 3455.359
you say oh gravity

3452.559 --> 3457.8390000000004
did you measure that did you measure the

3455.359 --> 3460.88
the forces that would be caused by

3457.839 --> 3463.92
one mass going in proximity no

3460.88 --> 3466.079
no you didn't you just assumed it and

3463.92 --> 3469.44
then synchronized that assumption

3466.079 --> 3472.88
with two cyclical models okay

3469.44 --> 3478.2400000000002
well there's the trick isn't it that's

3472.88 --> 3478.2400000000002
how heliocentricism is held together

3479.44 --> 3486.079
correlations and assumptions

3482.48 --> 3490.48
there's no actual palpable evidence

3486.079 --> 3490.48
of any of it it's ridiculous

3492.24 --> 3495.5989999999997
yeah there is no phenomenon of gravity

3494.4 --> 3497.119
francis

3495.599 --> 3499.44
why don't you join the flat earth

3497.119 --> 3502.6400000000003
debates it starts in

3499.44 --> 3506.0
about 54 minutes from now

3502.64 --> 3508.0
go to discord get on there and why don't

3506.0 --> 3511.52
you present your

3508.0 --> 3514.799
your evidence for this with nathan

3511.52 --> 3514.799
he knows how to deal with that

3515.119 --> 3522.2400000000002
because you're spiraling in denial

3518.559 --> 3524.2400000000002
gravity is not a force it doesn't

3522.24 --> 3525.839
imply mass attracting mass there's no

3524.24 --> 3527.4399999999996
evidence for this

3525.839 --> 3529.44
that that actually is a thing there's

3527.44 --> 3532.48
not even a claim

3529.44 --> 3533.92
not by the original conceiver of

3532.48 --> 3537.04
gravitation

3533.92 --> 3539.76
and not by any official sources it

3537.04 --> 3543.2799999999997
doesn't happen

3539.76 --> 3545.6800000000003
gravity is the bending of space-time

3543.28 --> 3546.799
it's not a force you can think of it as

3545.68 --> 3549.7599999999998
a force

3546.799 --> 3550.96
as a force you can think of that right

3549.76 --> 3552.3190000000004
you're allowed to do that

3550.96 --> 3554.64
it doesn't mean it's right though

3552.319 --> 3557.44
because it isn't a force

3554.64 --> 3559.44
but you can think it you it's a rumor

3557.44 --> 3562.319
that's very tenacious

3559.44 --> 3563.76
right it's wrong though it's wrong it's

3562.319 --> 3566.88
not a force

3563.76 --> 3572.079
right and bodies

3566.88 --> 3574.7200000000003
do not attract each other over distance

3572.079 --> 3577.119
no evidence for this at all not even

3574.72 --> 3577.1189999999997
close

3579.92 --> 3587.839
yeah incoming i know

3590.96 --> 3596.73
phenomenon of gravity referring to

3594.319 --> 3598.24
things falling uh

3596.73 --> 3601.52
[Music]

3598.24 --> 3607.359
you are a noob buddy you

3601.52 --> 3615.839
are a noob you bought it all didn't you

3607.359 --> 3615.839
bought all the nonsense

3628.42 --> 3631.78
[Music]

3636.54 --> 3643.839
[Music]

3639.44 --> 3643.839
what's going on

3645.599 --> 3651.119
yeah hey pam kyle stop why'd you stop

3648.319 --> 3651.119
nagging her

3653.599 --> 3671.839
don't don't nag my chat participants

3656.319 --> 3675.839
thank you very much pam cowell

3671.839 --> 3678.4
yeah yeah simon then i do

3675.839 --> 3680.799
yeah all your reference frames are

3678.4 --> 3680.799
ruined

3681.119 --> 3689.04
you have no evidence of gravity

3685.839 --> 3689.04
the earth spinning

3689.92 --> 3699.04
none of it earth is flat never claim the

3693.04 --> 3699.92
geometric horizon earth curve only

3699.04 --> 3702.5589999999997
exists

3699.92 --> 3702.559
in the math

3703.2 --> 3713.839
internet issues ah yes it's still going

3705.76 --> 3713.8390000000004
thank god

3724.839 --> 3731.04
ah hey he's starting 8012.

3729.839 --> 3733.68
yeah i'm doing great

3731.04 --> 3736.96
[Music]

3733.68 --> 3736.96
denying math

3738.0 --> 3741.28
okay well francis you went from somebody

3740.96 --> 3744.96
that

3741.28 --> 3747.28
actually seemed to be halfway decent

3744.96 --> 3748.2400000000002
in the attempt to inquire evidence but

3747.28 --> 3751.76
now you're just

3748.24 --> 3754.5589999999997
you've just turned into a bald heart

3751.76 --> 3755.44
it's like there's only so many fallacies

3754.559 --> 3757.52
there's only

3755.44 --> 3759.44
so many fallacies i'm going to be

3757.52 --> 3761.839
pointing out

3759.44 --> 3762.96
until it's just like okay i'm done with

3761.839 --> 3766.0789999999997
this [Â __Â ]

3762.96 --> 3767.2
you got too much baggage too much

3766.079 --> 3770.48
nonsense baggage

3767.2 --> 3774.0789999999997
you're not really listening or giving

3770.48 --> 3775.839
feedback recognition of anything i've

3774.079 --> 3779.52
said

3775.839 --> 3779.52
shut up you [Â __Â ]

3780.72 --> 3785.7599999999998
let you go ruin your own reference

3782.559 --> 3785.76
frames [Â __Â ]

3790.72 --> 3797.1189999999997
you want to work to talk anymore huh

3793.76 --> 3800.559
yeah yeah where is the actual palpable

3797.119 --> 3804.0
empirical mechanical evidence

3800.559 --> 3805.039
that links the correlation of celestial

3804.0 --> 3809.039
cycles

3805.039 --> 3810.7200000000003
with tight cycles have you provided the

3809.039 --> 3814.2400000000002
evidence yet

3810.72 --> 3814.24
francis have you

3817.119 --> 3821.039
yeah i want to talk i want to hear you

3819.599 --> 3825.039
actually provide the

3821.039 --> 3827.5200000000004
physical measured palpable evidence

3825.039 --> 3828.079
like the field measurements that prove

3827.52 --> 3831.359
that there

3828.079 --> 3836.96
is a mechanical chain link of

3831.359 --> 3840.24
forces to prove that the celestial cycle

3836.96 --> 3843.28
caused the thing there

3840.24 --> 3846.5589999999997
some way caused palpably

3843.28 --> 3849.039
measurably the tide yeah that's what

3846.559 --> 3851.92
this discussion was about that's not me

3849.039 --> 3853.76
not wanting to talk anymore that's me

3851.92 --> 3857.119
waiting on you to actually

3853.76 --> 3860.4
provide the physical evidence

3857.119 --> 3864.079
not based in just another [Â __Â ] story

3860.4 --> 3867.76
like gravity yeah

3864.079 --> 3871.6800000000003
i want palpable measurable evidence

3867.76 --> 3875.5200000000004
that proves a causal mechanical link

3871.68 --> 3880.72
between the tides happening oceanic

3875.52 --> 3884.64
water bodies being moved in the fashion

3880.72 --> 3887.839
and the light bodies in the sky

3884.64 --> 3889.7599999999998
now prove to me provide the physical

3887.839 --> 3892.88
evidence the measured

3889.76 --> 3897.039
palpable evidence proves

3892.88 --> 3897.039
mechanical chain link

3897.119 --> 3900.6400000000003
between the two okay

3901.44 --> 3906.319
provide information and it wasn't going

3904.079 --> 3907.52
anywhere yeah that's because gravity is

3906.319 --> 3909.44
not proof

3907.52 --> 3911.28
just saying gravity doesn't prove

3909.44 --> 3914.64
anything that's not a

3911.28 --> 3919.039
measurable physical chain link

3914.64 --> 3922.319
that provides the evidence of a cause

3919.039 --> 3925.6800000000003
it's just a story saying things drop

3922.319 --> 3929.0389999999998
that's gravity is not a mechanical

3925.68 --> 3932.3999999999996
chain like how do things dropping cause

3929.039 --> 3934.4
the oceanic bodies of water to move in a

3932.4 --> 3938.1600000000003
cyclical fashion you tell me how that

3934.4 --> 3938.1600000000003
causes that yeah things falling

3938.319 --> 3941.7599999999998
it doesn't yeah no [Â __Â ] it doesn't

3941.2 --> 3944.799
there's not

3941.76 --> 3947.2000000000003
things falling causing the tides

3944.799 --> 3947.2
okay

3948.88 --> 3951.839
what is causing it

3971.359 --> 3975.119
so yeah why don't you try again to

3973.76 --> 3978.6400000000003
provide evidence that

3975.119 --> 3981.2000000000003
actually backs the causal claim

3978.64 --> 3982.4
instead of just saying something and not

3981.2 --> 3985.1189999999997
pointing out

3982.4 --> 3987.359
how that provides the mechanical chain

3985.119 --> 3987.359
link

3987.52 --> 3994.16
right provide the evidence

3991.2 --> 3995.5989999999997
something that can be measured right if

3994.16 --> 3998.319
you want to say gravity is

3995.599 --> 3999.839
things falling well how does that cause

3998.319 --> 4002.0
it then

3999.839 --> 4004.96
oh yeah it makes no sense yeah no [Â __Â ]

4002.0 --> 4021.839
it makes no sense

4004.96 --> 4021.839
i know you said it though

4032.839 --> 4035.839
uh

4043.44 --> 4049.44
oh no nigel arnold are you

4046.72 --> 4050.72
actually trying to guilt-trip good

4049.44 --> 4053.76
servant oversight

4050.72 --> 4055.4399999999996
calling somebody a dumbass

4053.76 --> 4058.0
are you out of your [Â __Â ] mind your

4055.44 --> 4058.0
[Â __Â ]

4059.119 --> 4064.0
yeah you know why god doesn't like

4062.559 --> 4067.119
swearing

4064.0 --> 4069.039
because when you swear a lot it kind of

4067.119 --> 4071.76
brings you down

4069.039 --> 4072.079
it brings you down into the gutter right

4071.76 --> 4074.559
but

4072.079 --> 4076.96
that's the point when you swear you're

4074.559 --> 4079.52
swearing down to somebody

4076.96 --> 4081.2
now if you then go spiral in continue

4079.52 --> 4082.559
swearing and swearing and more swearing

4081.2 --> 4084.0
yeah that brings you down that's

4082.559 --> 4087.119
something god doesn't like

4084.0 --> 4088.48
that doesn't mean you can't express

4087.119 --> 4090.48
yourself properly

4088.48 --> 4091.52
to point at something that is in the

4090.48 --> 4094.559
gutter

4091.52 --> 4098.719
yeah god actually

4094.559 --> 4101.92
appreciates honest clear communication

4098.719 --> 4102.4800000000005
with real emotion and attention within

4101.92 --> 4104.159
it

4102.48 --> 4106.08
he just doesn't like it when you lose

4104.159 --> 4109.12
control when you do that

4106.08 --> 4110.0
yeah so why don't you stop shaming good

4109.12 --> 4113.679
servant

4110.0 --> 4116.4
for just having honest expression

4113.679 --> 4117.12
i mean it's not like he's going full agm

4116.4 --> 4119.679
or something

4117.12 --> 4122.719
because agent sometimes like goes

4119.679 --> 4124.56
overboard is not doing it right now

4122.719 --> 4126.88
but then i point it out too right i

4124.56 --> 4128.799
don't see how good servant is doing that

4126.88 --> 4132.64
by calling somebody a dumbass

4128.799 --> 4136.08
when they're pretty much a dumbass so

4132.64 --> 4136.08
why don't you just leave him alone

4143.92 --> 4147.6
simon then shut the [Â __Â ] up with your

4146.88 --> 4151.04
math

4147.6 --> 4155.1990000000005
retardation you [Â __Â ] get the [Â __Â ]

4151.04 --> 4158.56
out go ruin your own reference frames

4155.199 --> 4161.919999999999
just shut the hell up i don't want to do

4158.56 --> 4163.679
your stupid prefab math [Â __Â ] that you

4161.92 --> 4166.96
didn't even make yourself you

4163.679 --> 4171.92
just copy pasted it from some

4166.96 --> 4171.92
wannabe smart website

4172.0 --> 4175.359
like how to be how to seem smart for

4174.799 --> 4178.08
[Â __Â ]

4175.359 --> 4179.759
retards and that's your sources i know

4178.08 --> 4181.679
they are because you are one of the

4179.759 --> 4184.159
dumbest guys

4181.679 --> 4184.159
out there

4185.12 --> 4191.92
simon then

4188.719 --> 4194.159
and your constant gaslighting [Â __Â ]

4191.92 --> 4198.0
of how you're supposedly smart when

4194.159 --> 4200.96
you have no physical evidence whatsoever

4198.0 --> 4202.0
it's just that it's very tough for you

4200.96 --> 4204.0
to try and even

4202.0 --> 4205.44
prove that you're actually smart because

4204.0 --> 4208.88
anybody that's really

4205.44 --> 4212.0
actually smart doesn't even

4208.88 --> 4213.6
want to associate with you just to point

4212.0 --> 4216.88
out how stupid you are

4213.6 --> 4218.8
because it's so stupid what you do

4216.88 --> 4221.04
they just want to stay clear away and

4218.8 --> 4221.4400000000005
just forget that you exist because your

4221.04 --> 4224.96
very

4221.44 --> 4231.04
existence dumbs people down you're that

4224.96 --> 4233.679
stupid simon then okay

4231.04 --> 4235.679
so stop gaslighting yourself on how

4233.679 --> 4239.76
you're supposedly an intellectual you

4235.679 --> 4239.76
are one of the dumbest people i've ever

4303.199 --> 4311.759999999999
don't talk to him you only encourage him

4308.32 --> 4314.799999999999
like nobody should talk to him

4311.76 --> 4317.84
nothing he says provides

4314.8 --> 4321.4400000000005
any value in any form

4317.84 --> 4324.8
he's too stupid to learn from and that's

4321.44 --> 4324.799999999999
really an accomplishment

4354.84 --> 4357.84

4369.199 --> 4372.879999999999
out it's really

4370.08 --> 4373.84
kind of annoying if you then when they

4372.88 --> 4375.92
cannot answer

4373.84 --> 4379.12
start to ask questions right ballers do

4375.92 --> 4382.08
that [Â __Â ] all the time don't

4379.12 --> 4382.08
just leave them alone

4383.28 --> 4386.8
and by the way you know better than that

4385.84 --> 4392.0
simon dan

4386.8 --> 4392.0
never answers questions not really

4392.32 --> 4396.239
he might just answer a basic question

4395.28 --> 4398.96
because he

4396.239 --> 4400.718999999999
thinks that by sometimes answering basic

4398.96 --> 4401.679
questions that somehow gives him the

4400.719 --> 4405.6
right to

4401.679 --> 4409.1990000000005
avoid all real questions

4405.6 --> 4414.2390000000005

i hope you got that

4452.159 --> 4457.04
all right but yes things still stand you

4455.12 --> 4460.5599999999995
still haven't provided the actual

that's the question of today's show

make that clear

oh okay simon then spam

4496.08 --> 4511.84
your stupid math

test then [Â __Â ]

4520.96 --> 4524.719
we'll see if i'll answer it i don't give

holds on

4558.48 --> 4563.919999999999
last ability to be

4561.92 --> 4565.52
halfway competent with math i don't give

what the hell is that supposed to mean

4587.52 --> 4592.719
i'm sorry i i never learned math

4590.64 --> 4594.96
in english so i don't even know what

4592.719 --> 4597.199
those freaking words all mean

4594.96 --> 4597.199
so

4600.88 --> 4609.84
are you asking multiplication

4604.159 --> 4609.839999999999
of minus numbers

4612.08 --> 4618.08
six times two times minus one

oh [Â __Â ]

4620.56 --> 4623.84
is that what it is

4624.08 --> 4628.239
right i remember that [Â __Â ]

4634.48 --> 4639.5199999999995
can't you do math i'm sorry i'm not

4636.96 --> 4641.92
familiar with this english version of

4639.52 --> 4642.64
it you piece of [Â __Â ] i never learn it in

4641.92 --> 4645.76
english

4642.64 --> 4648.84
i learned it in dutch and i wasn't all

4645.76 --> 4652.8
that interested i did most of my math

4648.84 --> 4656.0
intuitively yeah do you understand

4652.8 --> 4659.1990000000005
i passed on math

4656.0 --> 4662.4
math with an a yeah i passed on it

4659.199 --> 4665.5199999999995
and i barely even went to class like

4662.4 --> 4667.44
the last year i literally visited

4665.52 --> 4668.56
active class with a teacher doing a

4667.44 --> 4672.159
thing

4668.56 --> 4676.400000000001
twice and i still passed

4672.159 --> 4678.639999999999
yeah so

4676.4 --> 4679.44
i don't give a [Â __Â ] about math i really

4678.64 --> 4681.6
don't i

4679.44 --> 4684.5599999999995
i know the tricks i know the mechanics i

4681.6 --> 4687.360000000001
just when you say something like

4684.56 --> 4687.360000000001
what is it again

4688.48 --> 4693.839999999999
i see

4694.64 --> 4700.159000000001
factor i don't know what that freaking

4696.56 --> 4700.159000000001
means factorize

4701.12 --> 4704.5599999999995
i mean i could deduce it but it doesn't

4703.6 --> 4706.64
automatically

4704.56 --> 4710.080000000001
ring a bell with the correlating dutch

physical mechanical chain

4765.92 --> 4771.1990000000005
causal link for the tides already

4769.04 --> 4773.36
yeah i just stopped getting involved

4771.199 --> 4775.36
with this stupid math crap

4773.36 --> 4777.04
simon dan's throwing out yeah why don't

4775.36 --> 4779.5199999999995

5102.88 --> 5106.159000000001
you're one of the dumbest people out

5104.719 --> 5110.88
there

5106.159 --> 5110.879999999999
and everybody knows it you know it

5111.28 --> 5115.12
that's probably the most tragic thing of

5113.44 --> 5119.12
all is most people that are

5115.12 --> 5122.48
really unbelievably stupid don't know

5119.12 --> 5127.28
how stupid they are you do

5122.48 --> 5129.28
then you know how stupid you are

5127.28 --> 5131.12
that's really the biggest tragedy of all

5129.28 --> 5134.159
because what you're going to do about it

5131.12 --> 5138.84
you just have enough consciousness left

5134.159 --> 5141.839999999999
to know how stupid you are now that's

5138.84 --> 5141.84
torture

5149.04 --> 5155.84
ah i love these shows

5160.239 --> 5169.839999999999
sometimes you just gotta do this sort of

5162.08 --> 5169.84
thing guys

5170.48 --> 5174.4
you know it's just like on a farm you

5172.719 --> 5178.32
gotta hunt

5174.4 --> 5180.32
furman and foxes and

5178.32 --> 5181.599999999999
or they're just gonna [Â __Â ] things up and

5180.32 --> 5184.719
you gotta get rough

5181.6 --> 5188.400000000001
so yeah i gotta weed out the weeds and

5184.719 --> 5188.719
you can't just like basically weed them

5188.4 --> 5192.719
out

5188.719 --> 5192.719
you gotta take them by the roots

5192.96 --> 5199.12
and hey maybe even demonstratively

5196.0 --> 5201.52
like crush it

5199.12 --> 5203.04
between a rock just to send out the

5201.52 --> 5206.4800000000005
signal

5203.04 --> 5209.679
to other plants like that

5206.48 --> 5214.799999999999
like yeah right there in this location

5209.679 --> 5214.8
you die get out right

5216.67 --> 5222.719
[Music]

5217.76 --> 5227.280000000001
so yeah sometimes you gotta gotta crush

5222.719 --> 5230.88
some wheat unroot them

5227.28 --> 5234.08
then demonstratively crush the roots

5230.88 --> 5236.400000000001
to send out the signal to other

5234.08 --> 5239.36
weeds like that you are not freaking

5236.4 --> 5242.96
welcome here

5239.36 --> 5246.0
and it looks ugly i know but yeah

5242.96 --> 5246.0
if you don't do it

5246.32 --> 5250.239
they'll just welcome themselves right

5250.84 --> 5253.84
back

5259.52 --> 5267.280000000001
no i'm i'm not mad with you

5262.719 --> 5271.199
francis i'm just run out of patience

5267.28 --> 5274.32
because you came in with a claim

5271.199 --> 5278.0
right and i

5274.32 --> 5281.92
analyzed your claim to the in

5278.0 --> 5285.92
detail and presented to you exactly

5281.92 --> 5285.92
what the problem is with the claim

5286.48 --> 5289.839999999999
and what is required to actually back

5289.199 --> 5292.638999999999
the claim

5289.84 --> 5293.6
and you haven't you said gravity and

5292.639 --> 5296.639
then you got all

5293.6 --> 5297.4400000000005
outreached and flustered and moved on i

5296.639 --> 5299.36
guess

5297.44 --> 5301.919999999999
right you haven't actually provided

5299.36 --> 5306.08
evidence for the claim

5301.92 --> 5308.719
you just use simon dan coming in

5306.08 --> 5310.239
as a red herring to move away from the

5308.719 --> 5313.76
fact that you have still

5310.239 --> 5317.28
not provided actual mechanical

5313.76 --> 5320.639
physical empirical causal

5317.28 --> 5323.599999999999
chain-link evidence for how

5320.639 --> 5325.92
the celestial bodies are supposedly

5323.6 --> 5328.4800000000005
causing that bulge of water

5325.92 --> 5330.08
to move which we know as the tide

5328.48 --> 5337.839999999999
phenomenon

5330.08 --> 5337.84
still haven't provided that evidence

5348.84 --> 5351.84
uh

5354.0 --> 5365.84
all right yeah i'll be back in two

5355.28 --> 5365.84
minutes guys keep

5446.84 --> 5449.84
um

5458.48 --> 5466.48
okay tiny wumbo how many flat earthers

5462.0 --> 5469.52
buy my idea well

5466.48 --> 5472.799999999999
you buy it or not there's no evidence

5469.52 --> 5476.159000000001
that the moon is physical though

5472.8 --> 5479.12
only suggestive

5476.159 --> 5479.12
interpretations

5479.199 --> 5487.839999999999
you know moon signal rebounds

5484.0 --> 5489.679
i made it an item where where is it

5487.84 --> 5491.6
where's the actual evidence that you can

5489.679 --> 5495.4400000000005
do that

5491.6 --> 5496.639
i i expressed or i laid out exactly what

5495.44 --> 5499.839999999999
would be required

5496.639 --> 5501.76
to empirically prove that you could do

5499.84 --> 5504.639
such a thing

5501.76 --> 5505.52
laid it out in detail several times

5504.639 --> 5508.56
there's a

5505.52 --> 5512.080000000001
an early bird show dedicated to it

5508.56 --> 5514.320000000001
with the title moon signal rebounds look

5512.08 --> 5516.8
it up

5514.32 --> 5518.48
yeah so there is no evidence that the

5516.8 --> 5521.360000000001
moon is physical

5518.48 --> 5522.4
and hey when it comes to things that you

5521.36 --> 5525.36
see

5522.4 --> 5527.599999999999
that you can't prove are physical well

5525.36 --> 5529.679
what can you categorize them at

5527.6 --> 5532.08
you know how do you categorize yeah yeah

5529.679 --> 5536.4
there's only one thing i know

5532.08 --> 5538.48
left and that's called holographic

5536.4 --> 5540.159
it's just light image it's an image of

5538.48 --> 5542.0
light and we don't know

5540.159 --> 5543.44
further information yeah so it's

5542.0 --> 5545.52
holographic

5543.44 --> 5547.599999999999
that's what's left when you have

5545.52 --> 5549.76
absolutely no proof that something is

5547.6 --> 5552.0
physical yet you see it

5549.76 --> 5553.679
yeah you'd have no other alternative

5552.0 --> 5554.96
left but to call it holographic and

5553.679 --> 5561.84
that's why i call

5554.96 --> 5561.84
it holographic

5566.96 --> 5571.679
moon is plasma yeah i've heard that idea

5569.44 --> 5574.5599999999995
dutch sailor but it doesn't work

5571.679 --> 5575.679
because plasma is a substance it's

5574.56 --> 5579.6
matter

5575.679 --> 5583.04
right matter has a proximity

5579.6 --> 5586.08
like plasma gas liquid solid

5583.04 --> 5590.0
these are all forms of

5586.08 --> 5593.6
matter matter is physical euclidean it

5590.0 --> 5596.4
has a position a perspective applies

5593.6 --> 5598.719
so if the moon was plasma that means it

5596.4 --> 5602.239
would have a euclidean position

5598.719 --> 5605.36
with a proximity somehow

5602.239 --> 5607.5199999999995
there yeah if literal material is

5605.36 --> 5610.4
involved and plasma is just that

5607.52 --> 5612.400000000001
that means there is a proximity involved

5610.4 --> 5613.28
it has the euclidean position it would

5612.4 --> 5617.839999999999
have to

5613.28 --> 5617.84
otherwise it makes no sense

5622.48 --> 5625.678999999999
so as far as i'm concerned it's just

5625.04 --> 5629.36
light

5625.679 --> 5631.76
now maybe plasma in some place

5629.36 --> 5632.799999999999
up there who knows whatever is up there

5631.76 --> 5635.84
completely

5632.8 --> 5638.4800000000005
out of reach maybe it has an

5635.84 --> 5641.12
influence on the manifestation of the

5638.48 --> 5644.5599999999995
holographic light of the moon

5641.12 --> 5648.08
but that wouldn't make the moon

5644.56 --> 5650.56
thing we see literally that plasma

5648.08 --> 5651.5199999999995
right so i'm not excluding that maybe

5650.56 --> 5653.52
plasma or

5651.52 --> 5655.679
something like that is involved i don't

5653.52 --> 5672.4800000000005
know could be

5655.679 --> 5674.719
it's outside a reach but it might be

5672.48 --> 5677.12
shadow change every day during 20 yes

5674.719 --> 5680.8
yes that's absolutely a part of

5677.12 --> 5684.639
the hologram nigel arnold it is

5680.8 --> 5687.28
that's right makes it very confusing

5684.639 --> 5687.679
right that's why they call it a lunatic

5687.28 --> 5691.36
because

5687.679 --> 5694.96
yeah it's very suggestive

5691.36 --> 5696.639
the moon the way it looks how much it is

5694.96 --> 5697.52
in your face compared to other

5696.639 --> 5701.04
celestials

5697.52 --> 5704.8
beside the sun it's very in your face

5701.04 --> 5707.6
it draws out your curiosity

5704.8 --> 5709.04
it's highly suggestive of some kind of

5707.6 --> 5712.159000000001
physical nature and that

5709.04 --> 5714.719
is very confusing and

5712.159 --> 5716.719
people have went nuts over it obsessed

5714.719 --> 5718.56
over it and that's why they call it a

5716.719 --> 5722.08
lunatic

5718.56 --> 5725.4400000000005
that started with that

5722.08 --> 5728.159
way before heliocentrism was ever

5725.44 --> 5730.0
brought to the wider public people would

5728.159 --> 5731.44
already look at the moon and have like

5730.0 --> 5733.52
but it has to be physical

5731.44 --> 5734.638999999999
why that makes no sense why does it look

5733.52 --> 5736.8
like that oh let me

5734.639 --> 5738.88
paint it why does it look like it has to

5736.8 --> 5741.6
be fizz right lunatic

5738.88 --> 5742.96
that was before heliocentrism was even

5741.6 --> 5745.679
educated

5742.96 --> 5747.119
before anybody really knew about that

5745.679 --> 5756.2390000000005
that already happened

5747.119 --> 5771.839999999999
they called them lunatics

5756.239 --> 5771.839999999999
because yeah the moon looks really weird

5782.84 --> 5785.84
right

5788.639 --> 5790.88
oh

5791.76 --> 5798.400000000001
francis gets back he'd like an answer

5795.119 --> 5813.839999999999
from me wow

5798.4 --> 5813.839999999999
i'd like an answer from him

5837.73 --> 5840.919999999999
[Music]

5852.84 --> 5855.84
uh

5856.4 --> 5869.36
do they steamy traveler do they do that

5860.8 --> 5871.1990000000005
i know they claim to do that

5869.36 --> 5872.5599999999995
all right yeah see you see you later

5871.199 --> 5875.759999999999
style in 80 12.

5872.56 --> 5883.84
thanks for being here i thought it was

5875.76 --> 5883.84
an amusing show as well

5884.48 --> 5888.32
right so steamy traveler yes it is

5886.8 --> 5890.8
claimed

5888.32 --> 5891.599999999999
by ham radio operators that you can

5890.8 --> 5894.639
bounce a

5891.6 --> 5896.400000000001
signal off the moon according to them

5894.639 --> 5897.92
how would that work well you would have

5896.4 --> 5900.879999999999
to

5897.92 --> 5904.0
have a ham radio and then a signal

5900.88 --> 5906.8
amplifier to say the least

5904.0 --> 5909.44
and then send it out and then supposedly

5906.8 --> 5912.400000000001
it bounces off the moon or

5909.44 --> 5914.799999999999
if you don't think that then there's

5912.4 --> 5916.159
supposed to be some kind of reflector up

5914.8 --> 5920.4800000000005
there

5916.159 --> 5923.36
whatever so they say and then you get

5920.48 --> 5924.08
a remnant of your signal back with your

5923.36 --> 5927.759999999999
receiver

5924.08 --> 5929.76
if things are correct right that's the

5927.76 --> 5932.96
claim

5929.76 --> 5933.4400000000005
that's what they claim how it works i've

5932.96 --> 5936.08
never

5933.44 --> 5938.638999999999
actually seen satisfactory evidence that

5936.08 --> 5940.4
that's a real thing though i've had made

5938.639 --> 5942.4800000000005
it into a whole item i

5940.4 --> 5944.719
did an episode about it i already said

5942.48 --> 5944.718999999999
that

5946.0 --> 5951.6
look it up moon signal rebounds

5949.6 --> 5954.8
flat earth early bird show moon signal

5951.6 --> 5954.8
rebounds you'll find it

5955.84 --> 5968.88
what's that

5966.4 --> 5968.879999999999
what the

5970.719 --> 5978.56
how to do it oh that's great

5975.04 --> 5981.44
that's just great they tell you how to

5978.56 --> 5984.2390000000005
do it and they don't actually do it

5981.44 --> 5984.239
brilliant

5986.639 --> 5995.84
they just talk about it isn't that just

5990.88 --> 5995.84
great thanks for that link

5998.159 --> 6003.28
steamy traveler just

6001.28 --> 6006.159
so you know they don't actually

6003.28 --> 6009.92
demonstrate doing it

6006.159 --> 6009.92
it's just blabbering on about it

6022.4 --> 6037.839999999999
they don't good servant they don't

6047.76 --> 6050.96
ah you do remember that episode you

6049.92 --> 6053.84
leave kevin on

6050.96 --> 6055.44
that makes me happy because i consider

6053.84 --> 6058.400000000001
it as

6055.44 --> 6060.0
one of the more grounding scientific

6058.4 --> 6063.28
setups that i have

6060.0 --> 6066.159
proposed right

6063.28 --> 6067.04
i'm very proud of making the details for

6066.159 --> 6070.159
them

6067.04 --> 6074.08
it equates to the proposed

6070.159 --> 6077.28
setup about testing moonlight

6074.08 --> 6080.5599999999995
whether it is literally something that

6077.28 --> 6084.4
injects cold or

6080.56 --> 6087.76
whether it has an entropy

6084.4 --> 6088.5599999999995
enhancing effect i made an episode about

6087.76 --> 6090.96
that one too

6088.56 --> 6093.04
very proud of that never actually

6090.96 --> 6094.4
engaged in the physical setup of testing

6093.04 --> 6097.92
it

6094.4 --> 6101.199
but it's it's out there it is

6097.92 --> 6104.4800000000005
described in detail

6101.199 --> 6108.719
there's a postulate and

6104.48 --> 6111.36
anybody could engage in that test

6108.719 --> 6112.96
to confirm whether it literally

6111.36 --> 6116.719
introduces cold

6112.96 --> 6120.2390000000005
into a closed off system

6116.719 --> 6121.44
or whether it only enhances the entropy

6120.239 --> 6124.48
in order for

6121.44 --> 6127.199
for heat things to cool off quicker

6124.48 --> 6127.919999999999
because that's that was the idea about

6127.199 --> 6130.799999999999
that

6127.92 --> 6130.8
behind that one

6133.6 --> 6137.679
i know julio pebb and they really didn't

6136.239 --> 6140.239
like i did that

6137.679 --> 6141.84
they really didn't like the ham radio

6140.239 --> 6144.5599999999995
challenge

6141.84 --> 6146.0
because yeah they they literally have

6144.56 --> 6149.280000000001
videos where they just say

6146.0 --> 6150.32
look at this look there's a thing and a

6149.28 --> 6153.36
computer screen

6150.32 --> 6155.36
it shows a graph and that means there's
