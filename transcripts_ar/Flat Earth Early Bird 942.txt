[Music]

96.159 --> 101.84
pretty much the same as yesterday

102.0 --> 104.88
cloud covered

105.92 --> 113.119
wet rain here

109.28 --> 115.84
in there although not as continuously as

113.119 --> 115.84
two days ago

117.759 --> 122.07900000000001
less wind maybe but yeah

125.92 --> 129.84
it's definitely cooling off over here

130.319 --> 135.04
hope it'll get back to that summer heat

132.72 --> 138.56
again at some point

135.04 --> 142.319
that would be nice but for now

138.56 --> 144.48
it's kind of like this and hey it's not

142.319 --> 147.599
really cold

144.48 --> 153.04
it's not like it's constantly wet like

147.599 --> 153.04
typically in autumn

153.68 --> 160.4
it's a dutch summer

157.599 --> 162.72
hello good servant first in chat good to

160.4 --> 162.72
see you

163.68 --> 185.12
uh it's friday

167.04 --> 188.79999999999998
the 2nd of july 2021

185.12 --> 188.8
let's see what this friday brings

197.04 --> 203.92
hello french sissac

201.04 --> 203.92
francis

205.12 --> 209.76
she's luck okay

210.64 --> 214.72
that's not all too easy to pronounce

214.879 --> 219.04
you from eastern europe somewhere

222.319 --> 227.83999999999997
polish right i knew it

230.48 --> 242.48
yeah welcome to the stream hello cleary

240.239 --> 244.0
yeah thanks by the way good servant if

242.48 --> 247.84
you say my last

244.0 --> 250.64
three weeks the shows have been good

247.84 --> 250.64000000000001
i hope so

252.56 --> 257.199
it's it i don't know it's a little tough

255.12 --> 258.079
for me to judge at this point i do watch

257.199 --> 262.639
some of it back

258.079 --> 265.68
and i do like watching my shows back

262.639 --> 270.0
and also in contrast to say

265.68 --> 273.28000000000003
two years ago my frequency is better

270.0 --> 276.32
and i'm very happy about that part

273.28 --> 278.96
my only personal issue is sometimes

276.32 --> 278.96
silence

281.6 --> 288.40000000000003
said long pauses but

285.28 --> 297.84
i don't know i think it it it all fits

288.4 --> 297.84
so i'm happy with my streams

298.72 --> 302.0
hey here we go again

305.039 --> 313.919
all right so yesterday

311.28 --> 315.19899999999996
there's plenty of stream yeah nathan and

313.919 --> 317.84
nathan

315.199 --> 320.639
the after show went on for like over one

317.84 --> 320.63899999999995
and a half hour

321.84 --> 328.71999999999997
like i left for groceries

325.36 --> 331.199
after the after show had already started

328.72 --> 332.72
or like or had been going on for 15

331.199 --> 334.72
minutes because it was pretty good it

332.72 --> 336.72
was all very technical

334.72 --> 339.759
then it went away and then as i came

336.72 --> 342.639
back it was still going and then kept on

339.759 --> 347.759
going for like half an hour

342.639 --> 347.759
so yeah very long thursday show

348.0 --> 354.56
i missed a chunk but yeah i'll

351.28 --> 357.11999999999995
be seeing that back on saturday pretty

354.56 --> 357.12
sure of that

364.84 --> 367.84
right

368.16 --> 372.16
right there were some other streams

369.68 --> 372.16
going on

372.24 --> 376.72
didn't really watch them watched a

374.72 --> 379.6
little bit of flat earth british

376.72 --> 380.319
but then i don't know drifted off into

379.6 --> 384.16
other stuff

380.319 --> 384.16
oh yeah i watched

384.479 --> 390.08
like the hobbit movie the second one

391.759 --> 395.84000000000003
it just popped by

396.4 --> 415.919
and i thought hey why not

409.84 --> 420.96
oh yeah yeah legolas dad

415.919 --> 420.96
is like a [ __ ] but that's okay

421.36 --> 423.84000000000003
uh

432.0 --> 437.84
he's still pretty convincing though

443.039 --> 447.52
and that that's a joke guys it's like i

446.479 --> 450.96
actually

447.52 --> 451.19899999999996
weirdly enough associating myself with

450.96 --> 454.56
an

451.199 --> 456.96000000000004
elf that was really a rough remark like

454.56 --> 460.4
i would never be caught

456.96 --> 465.84
by an action actual alvin king

460.4 --> 465.84
saying that uh

466.639 --> 473.199
unless he expressed some particular

471.52 --> 477.12
level of entertainment from my

473.199 --> 479.039
activities and then i might joke with it

477.12 --> 480.479
this is ridiculous there is no such

479.039 --> 485.12
thing

480.479 --> 488.15999999999997
but uh yeah watch that

485.12 --> 490.08
that was pretty cool yeah i almost i

488.16 --> 490.56
almost didn't want to start the stream

490.08 --> 493.599
because

490.56 --> 495.199
i was just watching the start of owen

493.599 --> 498.71999999999997
benjamin

495.199 --> 501.599
i also had a stream yesterday

498.72 --> 501.59900000000005
uh only just

502.879 --> 511.91900000000004
stupid dad pop-ups uh

507.599 --> 511.919
but yeah i'm gonna be live here and

512.719 --> 523.279
answer questions

520.0 --> 526.8
hello rob h good to see you ugh

523.279 --> 529.8389999999999
mark zweiler is sending me more people

526.8 --> 532.0799999999999
blabber messages literally he is being

529.839 --> 535.839
like a spambot

532.08 --> 537.519
ad he's just like oh you do this and

535.839 --> 540.399
your life would change this and your

537.519 --> 544.0
life would change i don't know

540.399 --> 546.88
how to shut him up at this point i mean

544.0 --> 546.88
can you block

547.12 --> 550.88
people in paypal

551.04 --> 556.8
uh i haven't figured out how that works

555.76 --> 560.399
but

556.8 --> 560.399
it's getting a bit on my nerves

560.72 --> 564.5600000000001
it doesn't seem to get the message that

563.36 --> 566.9590000000001
the format

564.56 --> 568.8
he is bringing it's not working i'm not

566.959 --> 572.16
gonna take his advice if he

568.8 --> 572.88
if he acts like this like never taking

572.16 --> 577.8389999999999
advice

572.88 --> 577.8389999999999
from somebody that's acting as a lunatic

579.839 --> 583.9200000000001
right maybe it was somehow routed in

583.279 --> 586.48
some good

583.92 --> 587.1999999999999
thing but he's acting like a lunatic and

586.48 --> 591.839
then

587.2 --> 591.839
so it always works out bad

594.08 --> 596.48
anyway

600.8 --> 619.8389999999999
other than that doing pretty good

605.6 --> 619.839
let's see

637.44 --> 645.44
oh good heard of the english

641.04 --> 649.1999999999999
trans woman priest non-binary

645.44 --> 652.0790000000001
representative of god sorry it's

649.2 --> 654.399
that's a terrible thing to bring up but

652.079 --> 654.399
yeah

658.839 --> 661.839
um

669.36 --> 677.36
okay well friends she's sick

673.44 --> 682.9590000000001
sorry it's gonna francis

677.36 --> 685.36
zai okay i'll just call you francis okay

682.959 --> 689.3599999999999
that part i can't pronounce yeah you

685.36 --> 692.72
came to the right place

689.36 --> 695.839
that's what i'm here for so yeah

692.72 --> 695.839
ask your questions

699.519 --> 705.2
but let me start out by asking you a

702.64 --> 709.1999999999999
question since you brought up science

705.2 --> 713.44
do you know what it is have you

709.2 --> 717.6
learned about paul buster's channel

713.44 --> 720.9590000000001
quantum eraser his presentations

717.6 --> 723.76
nathan oakley also provides the same

720.959 --> 726.88
platform pretty much

723.76 --> 730.88
and much of the same narrative right

726.88 --> 733.8389999999999
it's not a it is a narrative

730.88 --> 736.399
but it's a narrative based in logic and

733.839 --> 740.48
sound reasoning

736.399 --> 741.76
not in politics or misinformation or

740.48 --> 744.0790000000001
manipulation

741.76 --> 746.959
it's what it is the scientific method

744.079 --> 746.959
have you heard of it

757.12 --> 773.839
you heard he said what are you talking

759.04 --> 773.8389999999999
about good servant

774.639 --> 777.76
francis i hope this better not be that

777.04 --> 781.92
same

777.76 --> 781.92
old baller list of nonsense

782.8 --> 789.5999999999999
like eclipses and anti-portal star

787.279 --> 801.8389999999999
positions and

789.6 --> 801.839
oh please let it not be those questions

802.399 --> 806.88
glow busters uh did i say glow busters i

805.6 --> 810.32
meant ball busters

806.88 --> 811.4399999999999
that's like the saturday show i am part

810.32 --> 814.1600000000001
of it

811.44 --> 815.519
both shows that i mentioned i am part of

814.16 --> 819.36
it

815.519 --> 819.36
right i am on that panel

826.0 --> 831.519
how glowbusters is on

829.12 --> 834.639
sunday i think i don't know if it's

831.519 --> 834.639
still going probably

836.399 --> 840.24
right but my question was specific to

838.8 --> 843.279
the scientific method

840.24 --> 848.399
do you realize the issue

843.279 --> 851.6
with the bastardization the cultural

848.399 --> 855.6
bastardization of the word science

851.6 --> 858.8000000000001
how it's been chronically misused

855.6 --> 860.0790000000001
for quite a long time and systematically

858.8 --> 864.0
misapplied

860.079 --> 866.959
culturally through media through

864.0 --> 871.839
general talk from people that are

866.959 --> 871.8389999999999
supposed to know better

877.199 --> 883.199
talk later okay good servant

880.32 --> 885.839
well that's don't know what the hell

883.199 --> 885.8389999999999
that was for

887.92 --> 893.519
but okay talk to you later what about

890.56 --> 893.5189999999999
boats over what

896.839 --> 899.839
what

900.959 --> 914.56
daylight hours

912.16 --> 914.56
okay

917.72 --> 920.779
[Music]

926.05 --> 931.41
[Music]

929.839 --> 934.8800000000001
right so so what about it

931.41 --> 937.36
[Music]

934.88 --> 938.639
yeah different daylight times in

937.36 --> 942.32
different regions

938.639 --> 942.32
in different periods of the year

944.399 --> 955.839
what's the issue

978.48 --> 986.16
right uh yeah concerning the north pole

982.8 --> 989.199
as a point it's not there

986.16 --> 992.48
nobody ever goes there and like actually

989.199 --> 994.639
is at the exact north pole so the north

992.48 --> 998.0790000000001
pole is mostly a region

994.639 --> 1000.92
the region most north and that is the

998.079 --> 1004.3199999999999
region where there is

1000.92 --> 1006.959
24-hour daylight or nighttime

1004.32 --> 1010.0790000000001
experiences

1006.959 --> 1025.839
based on the time of the year that's the

1010.079 --> 1025.839
region that's not a point

1036.839 --> 1041.36
hey

1038.079 --> 1044.24
wait are you asking why is there

1041.36 --> 1044.8799999999999
one point on earth 24-hour sun when

1044.24 --> 1047.76
there is

1044.88 --> 1048.72
24-hour night at the same time on

1047.76 --> 1053.84
another point

1048.72 --> 1053.84
on the earth is that your question

1078.84 --> 1081.84
hmm

1088.64 --> 1096.48
okay now wait

1093.039 --> 1097.84
yeah yeah the apps does help although it

1096.48 --> 1101.3600000000001
is all disk based

1097.84 --> 1101.36
you know you could basically

1103.2 --> 1108.559
reproject the land in a rectangular

1106.4 --> 1112.4
fashion with the same app

1108.559 --> 1115.039
and instead of on a disk

1112.4 --> 1115.8400000000001
it would be a rectangular screen and

1115.039 --> 1117.84
then you would see

1115.84 --> 1118.8799999999999
the position of the sun and the moon or

1117.84 --> 1122.48
you could center

1118.88 --> 1125.8400000000001
around them and make

1122.48 --> 1128.799
the map in a looping fashion

1125.84 --> 1129.52
scroll instead of the celestials however

1128.799 --> 1132.799
yeah right

1129.52 --> 1135.36
side like the uh square earth cosmology

1132.799 --> 1136.0
videos like they do it you could do that

1135.36 --> 1138.1599999999999
with an app

1136.0 --> 1141.6
as well would be pretty much the same

1138.16 --> 1141.6000000000001
thing just another projection

1143.039 --> 1150.16
right so it's not that disk

1146.4 --> 1153.679
which would be a yeah thing that's not

1150.16 --> 1153.679
entirely certain if that's

1162.84 --> 1165.84
euclidean

1167.039 --> 1170.96
try again in one what why would you

1170.48 --> 1174.24
assume

1170.96 --> 1174.24
you're not wording it well

1175.76 --> 1180.8799999999999
what is the issue

1179.2 --> 1184.4
right you don't have to be super

1180.88 --> 1188.3200000000002
specific with like island names and

1184.4 --> 1190.48
all that i don't really know them

1188.32 --> 1192.559
just say okay this is just very much

1190.48 --> 1195.919
north very much south

1192.559 --> 1199.76
very much near to the equator right

1195.919 --> 1199.76
you don't have to be super specific

1202.72 --> 1206.88
at least i believe you wouldn't unless

1205.44 --> 1209.919
this is some kind of a math

1206.88 --> 1209.919
detail question

1216.48 --> 1221.84
right norway

1229.12 --> 1231.6789999999999
williams

1232.96 --> 1239.28
further from the sun

1236.24 --> 1242.64
in the flat earth

1239.28 --> 1246.32
uh no

1242.64 --> 1250.0
what do you mean further from closer to

1246.32 --> 1252.8799999999999
further from the sun are you saying that

1250.0 --> 1255.2
the sun is a physical object that is

1252.88 --> 1257.8400000000001
literally in a euclidean position

1255.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
hovering over a disk

1257.84 --> 1263.84
because that is a misconception

1279.039 --> 1282.08
closer to what

1287.84 --> 1292.0
look from the data francis that you've

1291.36 --> 1295.28
put out

1292.0 --> 1297.12
within your questioning it's already

1295.28 --> 1300.72
becoming apparent to me that you

1297.12 --> 1305.6
are having euclidean

1300.72 --> 1309.2
issues right with the map projection

1305.6 --> 1312.32
disk map projection

1309.2 --> 1314.0800000000002
so you're assuming wait there's light

1312.32 --> 1316.48
here light there

1314.08 --> 1317.36
this is where the disk projection says

1316.48 --> 1319.84
the sun is

1317.36 --> 1319.84
but why

1320.799 --> 1328.0
is it not literally there

1323.84 --> 1328.0
yeah because it isn't literally there

1329.12 --> 1332.2399999999998
the sun is not a physical object it's

1331.919 --> 1334.64
not

1332.24 --> 1337.2
in a literal position it's a light

1334.64 --> 1337.2
manifest

1340.72 --> 1345.44
that's right it doesn't have it's worse

1342.799 --> 1349.52
than not a definitive position

1345.44 --> 1349.52
it doesn't have an actual position

1350.08 --> 1357.4399999999998
it's not a physical object it's a

1353.52 --> 1360.1589999999999
manifestation or

1357.44 --> 1360.72
from my perception from what i've

1360.159 --> 1364.48
gathered

1360.72 --> 1365.919
so far the sun is not even primary it's

1364.48 --> 1369.3600000000001
a side effect

1365.919 --> 1369.3600000000001
of the light manifest

1370.159 --> 1374.24
so it's not coming from this bright disc

1373.12 --> 1376.1589999999999
no the bright disc

1374.24 --> 1378.799
is a side effect of looking straight

1376.159 --> 1383.8400000000001
towards

1378.799 --> 1383.84
the angular manifest of daylight

1384.08 --> 1387.52
and the same goes with all the other

1385.52 --> 1391.12
celestials

1387.52 --> 1391.12
although they are not as intense

1398.4 --> 1401.8400000000001
where does the light come from well

1400.32 --> 1404.24
nobody really

1401.84 --> 1405.12
knows or understands that right people

1404.24 --> 1407.679
attempt to

1405.12 --> 1407.6789999999999
model it

1408.24 --> 1414.96
right try to

1411.36 --> 1415.4399999999998
find an explanation but it's all based

1414.96 --> 1418.64
in

1415.44 --> 1422.3200000000002
in just physical euclidean

1418.64 --> 1423.5200000000002
position based things or they talk about

1422.32 --> 1426.3999999999999
mirrors

1423.52 --> 1428.0
without any real evidence for that

1426.4 --> 1429.279
either because with a mirror they're

1428.0 --> 1432.4
still proximities

1429.279 --> 1444.32
even through the virtually added space

1432.4 --> 1446.88
through the reflector so

1444.32 --> 1448.24
we don't know exactly where the light

1446.88 --> 1451.7600000000002
comes from

1448.24 --> 1454.159
we just know it manifests in a specific

1451.76 --> 1456.24
angular relation to the position on

1454.159 --> 1459.7600000000002
earth

1456.24 --> 1462.72
there's a distinct oscillating pattern

1459.76 --> 1462.72
to the whole of it

1463.12 --> 1468.6399999999999
but you can't really pinpoint any of the

1466.64 --> 1471.919
celestials you can't

1468.64 --> 1472.3200000000002
reach them approach them move closer and

1471.919 --> 1475.76
then

1472.32 --> 1478.72
have the perception of this angular size

1475.76 --> 1480.64
increase of the celestial bodies and

1478.72 --> 1484.799
that includes the moon

1480.64 --> 1486.88
which is supposedly very close right

1484.799 --> 1489.279
there's no angular size increase when

1486.88 --> 1492.7990000000002
you attempt to approach

1489.279 --> 1496.4
their virtual euclidean position assumed

1492.799 --> 1499.84
based on a model triangulation right

1496.4 --> 1501.919
so there's no evidence that they are

1499.84 --> 1504.48
physical or that you can actually

1501.919 --> 1505.3600000000001
measure a literal distance to them any

1504.48 --> 1508.48
of them

1505.36 --> 1510.0
right that is like a really mind-blowing

1508.48 --> 1512.84
detail

1510.0 --> 1514.64
that nobody really likes to deal with

1512.84 --> 1516.48
because

1514.64 --> 1518.88
when somebody's listening and then

1516.48 --> 1521.3600000000001
trying to

1518.88 --> 1523.0390000000002
educate themselves on reality yeah it

1521.36 --> 1524.9599999999998
presents like a giant gap

1523.039 --> 1526.08
like yeah there's something we really

1524.96 --> 1528.88
don't know

1526.08 --> 1529.76
well that makes people feel stupid i

1528.88 --> 1532.279
guess

1529.76 --> 1533.76
so they then would rather choose for a

1532.279 --> 1536.0
reification

1533.76 --> 1538.4
where they just claim it's physical in

1536.0 --> 1540.799
some way in some place

1538.4 --> 1541.6000000000001
so they can continue the story and not

1540.799 --> 1543.52
be

1541.6 --> 1545.4399999999998
forced to present like yeah there's a

1543.52 --> 1547.84
giant gap in in

1545.44 --> 1550.0800000000002
in our understanding here and that's not

1547.84 --> 1550.9599999999998
because we're stupid or uninformed it's

1550.08 --> 1553.1999999999998
because

1550.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
it's really complicated and most people

1553.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
don't want to deal with it

1563.2 --> 1567.8400000000001
photons are energy oh really

1568.4 --> 1574.0800000000002
photon is a model but yeah light is

1571.279 --> 1576.799
energy indeed

1574.08 --> 1577.1999999999998
where's the source for all the energy

1576.799 --> 1581.279
well

1577.2 --> 1584.72
the source would be the energy

1581.279 --> 1587.039
i mean energy through matter manifests

1584.72 --> 1591.1200000000001
light

1587.039 --> 1594.4
electricity creates light in matter

1591.12 --> 1594.3999999999999
we know it as a lamp

1595.039 --> 1600.32
so where i think if i had to

1598.08 --> 1601.9189999999999
would be forced to basically model

1600.32 --> 1605.12
together some kind of energy

1601.919 --> 1607.44
circuit that sustains it all then i'd

1605.12 --> 1610.7199999999998
say that the celestials are

1607.44 --> 1614.0800000000002
electric in origin

1610.72 --> 1616.32
but not in a straightforward setup that

1614.08 --> 1618.08
we would typically

1616.32 --> 1619.9189999999999
be able to understand in order to

1618.08 --> 1622.0
recreate it

1619.919 --> 1625.679
there's something weird going on in the

1622.0 --> 1629.12
way this light is manifesting

1625.679 --> 1633.52
and it's so persistent and eternal so

1629.12 --> 1633.52
there is it's a big puzzle

1633.76 --> 1637.44
but yeah since there is light

1635.44 --> 1640.799
manifesting it's literally

1637.44 --> 1643.919
changing the dynamics within the realm

1640.799 --> 1644.799
through the heat that means there is

1643.919 --> 1647.279
energy

1644.799 --> 1647.279
moving

1647.84 --> 1652.399
and that energy would have to come from

1652.84 --> 1655.84
somewhere

1656.24 --> 1663.679
but it's not coming from a a

1659.44 --> 1665.279
pinpoint position physical generator

1663.679 --> 1666.64
it's not like oh the light is all coming

1665.279 --> 1669.76
from this one point

1666.64 --> 1672.96
in physical space no

1669.76 --> 1677.12
it's just manifesting

1672.96 --> 1680.3990000000001
angular wise locally everywhere it's it

1677.12 --> 1680.399
yeah it's like

1680.64 --> 1690.0800000000002
a rough comparison the entire gas body

1684.96 --> 1693.76
within the realm is the lamp

1690.08 --> 1697.039
but really fractal and weird and motion

1693.76 --> 1698.799
full that yeah you know

1697.039 --> 1700.72
when you have a lamp there's a gas in

1698.799 --> 1704.72
the lamp the gas is a

1700.72 --> 1707.2
near function to it to how it works

1704.72 --> 1708.24
well consider that the entire realm

1707.2 --> 1712.32
enclosure

1708.24 --> 1712.32
would be the lamp's gas

1712.799 --> 1716.96
now of course there's not a wire

1714.72 --> 1720.159
somewhere to actually

1716.96 --> 1722.48
yeah make that lamp into a euclidean

1720.159 --> 1722.48
lamp

1722.84 --> 1727.6789999999999
but

1724.48 --> 1730.96
there is plenty of gas

1727.679 --> 1730.96
there is electricity

1731.6 --> 1734.6399999999999
so yeah in that sense the realm already

1733.919 --> 1738.64
has

1734.64 --> 1741.5200000000002
plenty of elements to suffice

1738.64 --> 1742.24
the engineering principles of a of a

1741.52 --> 1745.36
lamp

1742.24 --> 1745.36
an electric lamp

1749.039 --> 1766.399
is gas not mass what uh

1752.799 --> 1770.08
what does that have to do with it

1766.399 --> 1773.12
how does it have tidal

1770.08 --> 1773.12
effects what

1773.919 --> 1779.3600000000001
how does the sun have tidal effects do

1775.84 --> 1779.36
you have any evidence for this

1779.84 --> 1783.4399999999998
what the the sun

1784.159 --> 1789.0390000000002
i i think you mean the moon because in

1787.159 --> 1792.8400000000001
heliocentrism it is

1789.039 --> 1794.08
claimed the moon causes the tides on

1792.84 --> 1797.12
earth

1794.08 --> 1800.72
but this is even

1797.12 --> 1805.039
geometrically ridiculous

1800.72 --> 1808.799
tides are caused by angel spoons locally

1805.039 --> 1810.8799999999999
and two or three times a day

1808.799 --> 1814.08
that has nothing to do with the

1810.88 --> 1817.6000000000001
presupposed trajectory of the moon

1814.08 --> 1820.96
it's ridiculous like even

1817.6 --> 1823.9599999999998
in mainstream representations it's

1820.96 --> 1825.919
shown like yeah if it would be like what

1823.96 --> 1827.8400000000001
heliocentrism says it does

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
then there would be a giant bulge of

1827.84 --> 1831.039
ocean constantly pulled around the

1829.84 --> 1834.84
equator

1831.039 --> 1837.84
this is ridiculous that's not what's

1834.84 --> 1837.84
happening

1841.44 --> 1844.88
okay are you still able to follow what

1843.76 --> 1848.559
i'm talking about

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
i know i probably put your mind into

1848.559 --> 1851.84
unfamiliar territory

1867.2 --> 1874.559
no no they don't francis

1870.88 --> 1876.96
you have no evidence for this at all

1874.559 --> 1878.24
you cannot prove there's even a

1876.96 --> 1881.519
correlation

1878.24 --> 1882.32
between the tides and the sun and the

1881.519 --> 1886.64
moon's

1882.32 --> 1886.6399999999999
angular position on the earth

1887.84 --> 1892.08
it's not without dispute it is it is

1890.48 --> 1895.3600000000001
without dispute that there is

1892.08 --> 1898.32
no evidence for this whatsoever not even

1895.36 --> 1898.9599999999998
correlative evidence okay nothing

1898.32 --> 1902.24
there's

1898.96 --> 1904.72
nothing unless you would like to present

1902.24 --> 1905.84
anything other than just so stories that

1904.72 --> 1908.08
make the claim

1905.84 --> 1910.0
without the evidence because there's

1908.08 --> 1912.32
plenty of that out there

1910.0 --> 1915.12
but there's no actual evidence not even

1912.32 --> 1915.12
correlatory

1916.0 --> 1920.12
like the modeling doesn't even make any

1918.84 --> 1923.25
sense

1920.12 --> 1923.25
[Music]

1925.12 --> 1929.76
not seeking star wars it might simply be

1927.36 --> 1932.4799999999998
just acting out

1929.76 --> 1932.48
conditioning

1932.96 --> 1938.64
i think it's just conditioning

1936.32 --> 1940.96
oh few sources then no i don't need

1938.64 --> 1942.64
sources to just show stories that make

1940.96 --> 1945.1200000000001
the claim and do not provide the

1942.64 --> 1948.3200000000002
evidence or

1945.12 --> 1948.9599999999998
bridge the giant gap in correlatory

1948.32 --> 1952.08
evidence

1948.96 --> 1956.48
even so no i've seen

1952.08 --> 1956.48
all of that it makes no sense

1956.559 --> 1960.799
doesn't matter you can provide me with

1958.559 --> 1962.799
10 sources saying the same crap in

1960.799 --> 1966.32
different ways over and over again

1962.799 --> 1969.9189999999999
none of them will have actual evidence

1966.32 --> 1977.84
it's all just so stories i know this

1969.919 --> 1977.8400000000001
i've been doing this for six years

1982.159 --> 1988.0
so you got anything else francis

1985.76 --> 1988.799
i mean are you trying to understand

1988.0 --> 1992.159
something here

1988.799 --> 1994.799
or are you just trying to reinforce your

1992.159 --> 1994.7990000000002
conditioning

1997.84 --> 2005.9189999999999
if i can find one that provides the

2000.919 --> 2008.88
observation the observation of what

2005.919 --> 2009.3600000000001
of a moon or a sun being in the sky and

2008.88 --> 2011.7600000000002
then

2009.36 --> 2013.84
a tide happening somewhere and that's

2011.76 --> 2015.84
supposed to prove that it causes the

2013.84 --> 2019.84
tides

2015.84 --> 2019.84
makes no sense

2020.799 --> 2024.1589999999999
that literally makes no sense there's no

2023.2 --> 2027.6000000000001
forces

2024.159 --> 2032.24
being measured there is no

2027.6 --> 2034.9599999999998
indication of any palpable data

2032.24 --> 2035.84
concerning the sun and the moon that

2034.96 --> 2040.08
would

2035.84 --> 2042.72
somehow indicate that it pulls water

2040.08 --> 2043.6789999999999
okay salt water there's no indication

2042.72 --> 2047.84
that it is

2043.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
the cause of it

2054.879 --> 2061.839
shut up nigel wanker

2082.48 --> 2090.399
do you understand physics francis

2088.32 --> 2092.079
you understand that if you're going to

2090.399 --> 2095.1189999999997
point at a

2092.079 --> 2098.7200000000003
palpable physical phenomenon

2095.119 --> 2100.839
in the world like tides

2098.72 --> 2102.16
and there's physical displacement

2100.839 --> 2105.4
happening

2102.16 --> 2110.56
that you're going to have to provide a a

2105.4 --> 2114.8
palpable measurable chain of events

2110.56 --> 2118.72
of forces of mechanics

2114.8 --> 2122.7200000000003
in order to establish the cause for it

2118.72 --> 2122.72
right i i tried to point that out

2123.04 --> 2127.839
right there's actually a body of salt

2125.599 --> 2128.7200000000003
water displacing that's gonna have to

2127.839 --> 2131.68
actually be

2128.72 --> 2132.72
palpable otherwise how can something not

2131.68 --> 2137.68
palpable

2132.72 --> 2137.68
cause a body of water to this place yeah

2137.839 --> 2146.24
now seeing specific lights in the sky

2143.119 --> 2147.44
when that happens does not provide a

2146.24 --> 2151.52
chain

2147.44 --> 2159.839
link of events and mechanics that could

2151.52 --> 2159.839
cause that

2160.96 --> 2166.4
i'm not letting you provide what are you

2163.76 --> 2166.4
talking about

2166.72 --> 2170.7999999999997
you're here in chat aren't you how can i

2170.079 --> 2174.32
stop you

2170.8 --> 2176.7200000000003
from providing the evidence i'm just

2174.32 --> 2178.48
giving you forewarning of what you're

2176.72 --> 2181.9199999999996
gonna attempt and why i know

2178.48 --> 2184.079
it's gonna fail i've been there

2181.92 --> 2185.2000000000003
right i'm not stopping you you wanna do

2184.079 --> 2187.119
it do it

2185.2 --> 2188.56
right there it's there in check i'm not

2187.119 --> 2193.04
stopping you

2188.56 --> 2193.04
i'm just telling you this is pointless

2194.8 --> 2200.7200000000003
doesn't mean that you can't try you know

2198.4 --> 2203.28
just trying to point out why this is not

2200.72 --> 2203.2799999999997
gonna work

2209.18 --> 2215.839
[Music]

2210.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
hey seeking star wars

2225.52 --> 2229.839
no good servant

2245.04 --> 2257.839
that's a really silly conclusion to draw

2262.64 --> 2267.52
you're getting messages in your heart to

2264.32 --> 2267.52
step away one agent

2268.56 --> 2273.599
all right i'm talking to a good servant

2274.88 --> 2279.839
that's my tight explanation with cr what

2280.32 --> 2287.3590000000004
oh hmm okay okay

2284.32 --> 2290.1600000000003
yeah yeah

2287.359 --> 2291.92
that's actually a pretty good example of

2290.16 --> 2295.1189999999997
a similar

2291.92 --> 2295.839
false conclusion based just a story yeah

2295.119 --> 2297.92
yeah that's

2295.839 --> 2299.04
i i appreciate that good servant well

2297.92 --> 2313.839
done

2299.04 --> 2313.839
it is a good comparison

2315.119 --> 2322.0
well why don't you just stop asking

2318.32 --> 2324.2400000000002
what do this what do that what and just

2322.0 --> 2326.32
you were making a claim and just provide

2324.24 --> 2328.72
your evidence and then i will scrutinize

2326.32 --> 2332.48
your evidence

2328.72 --> 2334.56
it's no need to ask me on how to present

2332.48 --> 2341.839
the evidence i already gave you

2334.56 --> 2341.839
everything you need to know about it

2352.839 --> 2355.839
francis

2364.76 --> 2369.8390000000004
[Music]

2366.839 --> 2369.839
uh

2404.88 --> 2409.04
yeah that's all very meta you're not

2406.72 --> 2411.9199999999996
providing any evidence

2409.04 --> 2412.64
i i don't need to know on how you would

2411.92 --> 2415.119
provide

2412.64 --> 2417.5989999999997
evidence i just want you to provide

2415.119 --> 2417.599
evidence

2419.599 --> 2424.6400000000003
and i don't care about blame games or

2422.16 --> 2427.5989999999997
your worries about those yeah

2424.64 --> 2429.839
just provide the evidence or admit you

2427.599 --> 2432.2400000000002
don't have any

2429.839 --> 2432.88
you just have just her stories none of

2432.24 --> 2436.319
which

2432.88 --> 2439.76
actually contain evidence

2436.319 --> 2442.24
that is empirical in nature or even make

2439.76 --> 2443.6800000000003
a solid claim on the chain of events

2442.24 --> 2446.72
mechanically

2443.68 --> 2447.1189999999997
involving the tides okay because none of

2446.72 --> 2449.359
them

2447.119 --> 2449.359
do

2450.23 --> 2454.56
[Music]

2451.76 --> 2457.0400000000004
right and they all involve gravity based

2454.56 --> 2458.96
on newtonian mechanics which is already

2457.04 --> 2461.04
officially denied

2458.96 --> 2462.96
because that's not even what gravity is

2461.04 --> 2464.8
anymore even though the entire solar

2462.96 --> 2468.48
system mechanics are still based on it

2464.8 --> 2468.48
which is completely ludicrous

2469.599 --> 2474.319
it's a crazy world out there if you

2471.52 --> 2474.319
believe in the globe

2478.839 --> 2495.839
francis get to a point

2482.0 --> 2495.839
or get banned

2498.0 --> 2503.04
all right i do appreciate his input by

2500.16 --> 2503.04
the way you know

2505.92 --> 2509.76
but i don't have unlimited patience for

2508.56 --> 2513.04
for just

2509.76 --> 2513.0400000000004
people that stall

2516.24 --> 2523.839
that is annoying

2535.119 --> 2539.2000000000003
all right so now he's actually going to

2537.359 --> 2540.0
look for the evidence isn't that just

2539.2 --> 2542.0
cute

2540.0 --> 2544.56
isn't that just typical first you make

2542.0 --> 2544.56
the claim

2544.72 --> 2548.72
then you assume you're going to win

2546.24 --> 2552.24
because you know how to uphold the story

2548.72 --> 2554.48
then somebody tests you on that

2552.24 --> 2557.2
and then you suddenly have to actually

2554.48 --> 2558.56
figure out the details of the story that

2557.2 --> 2562.0789999999997
you championed

2558.56 --> 2564.72
oh let me look it up why

2562.079 --> 2566.6400000000003
because you didn't really look into it

2564.72 --> 2569.359
before

2566.64 --> 2570.0
none of them do ballers don't do that

2569.359 --> 2573.119
you're not

2570.0 --> 2573.119
trained to do that

2573.52 --> 2578.079
you're just trained to explain not to

2575.839 --> 2581.2
read the details not to critically think

2578.079 --> 2581.2000000000003
about the details

2584.16 --> 2588.3999999999996
but yeah this is just a typical

2586.64 --> 2593.839
situation

2588.4 --> 2593.839
we'll see what he comes back with

2594.64 --> 2598.5
[Music]

2605.599 --> 2611.04
yeah that's silly well you know if you

2607.76 --> 2613.92
don't know then you'll shut up

2611.04 --> 2614.48
you don't necessarily have to do that

2613.92 --> 2618.16
you know

2614.48 --> 2621.52
if you're not going to be zealous

2618.16 --> 2624.16
and you just act adaptively

2621.52 --> 2625.44
then you can make a claim about

2624.16 --> 2627.68
something

2625.44 --> 2629.2000000000003
without necessarily reading into the

2627.68 --> 2632.3999999999996
details of it first

2629.2 --> 2634.96
just by bringing it up because you know

2632.4 --> 2638.2400000000002
when something comes up

2634.96 --> 2640.2400000000002
that could be pretty random that moment

2638.24 --> 2641.68
so it does mean like oh something just

2640.24 --> 2643.7599999999998
came up with me i need to

2641.68 --> 2645.2799999999997
in detail research a lot of things now

2643.76 --> 2647.8390000000004
before i start talking about it no

2645.28 --> 2650.4
no no you can bring something up but

2647.839 --> 2653.7599999999998
then you also need to expect

2650.4 --> 2656.56
that you might make a mistake about it

2653.76 --> 2658.2400000000002
and if somebody then correct you in that

2656.56 --> 2661.04
mistake

2658.24 --> 2665.04
then you need to adapt if it actually is

2661.04 --> 2665.04
a real mistake and not just gaslighting

2665.28 --> 2669.8390000000004
right and if you do that then there's no

2667.44 --> 2669.839
problem

2670.24 --> 2674.3999999999996
right admitting to a mistake is all

2672.8 --> 2679.599
about progress

2674.4 --> 2683.6800000000003
that's what really makes progress

2679.599 --> 2686.2400000000002
and it's very relieving to just do that

2683.68 --> 2687.5989999999997
just say oh this and this this right and

2686.24 --> 2690.56
then somebody else

2687.599 --> 2691.52
no almost but you got this wrong and i'm

2690.56 --> 2695.04
like ah

2691.52 --> 2697.7599999999998
all right now i know and guess what i

2695.04 --> 2698.24
might make that mistake again sometime

2697.76 --> 2700.48
later

2698.24 --> 2701.839
especially if i've been through a lot in

2700.48 --> 2705.599
in between

2701.839 --> 2706.64
but eventually i will stop then making

2705.599 --> 2708.56
that mistake

2706.64 --> 2709.839
and i no longer have to be corrected

2708.56 --> 2714.24
because the correct

2709.839 --> 2714.24
the correction has settled

2715.44 --> 2724.56
and then you really learned it

2719.839 --> 2724.56
this is how i learn complicated things

2726.48 --> 2734.079
complicated procedures by constantly

2730.96 --> 2736.2400000000002
trying it out making mistakes but not

2734.079 --> 2738.319
be afraid of the mistakes sometimes you

2736.24 --> 2739.359
need to make the mistakes in order to

2738.319 --> 2742.8
perfect

2739.359 --> 2744.64
the actual actions because if you know

2742.8 --> 2747.119
what mistakes could happen

2744.64 --> 2747.92
then you can take that spiritually into

2747.119 --> 2750.88
account

2747.92 --> 2760.7200000000003
in the full dynamics of the action as

2750.88 --> 2762.7200000000003
you perform it

2760.72 --> 2764.24
ah life is all about correcting your

2762.72 --> 2767.2799999999997
mistakes

2764.24 --> 2768.7999999999997
and so is sin it's basically the same

2767.28 --> 2772.96
story

2768.8 --> 2777.28
different playbook same story

2772.96 --> 2781.44
science logos

2777.28 --> 2781.44
the same playbook different story

2784.4 --> 2789.76
[Music]

2787.44 --> 2791.04
hey clutch bear gary van gaal hey dan

2789.76 --> 2794.4
winfield

2791.04 --> 2795.44
long time no see then wow dan winfield

2794.4 --> 2798.64
and me go

2795.44 --> 2798.64
back way back

2801.599 --> 2805.2000000000003
like five years or something

2810.079 --> 2817.8390000000004
how are you doing man i hope you stayed

2813.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
clear of the facts

2822.0 --> 2827.359
is it dan winfield or are you just

2824.079 --> 2827.3590000000004
another w

2827.92 --> 2831.839
i don't know

2846.0 --> 2849.359
right that [ __ ] thank you i appreciate

2848.24 --> 2859.839
that indeed

2849.359 --> 2859.839
i will not be bribed to say [ __ ]

2860.88 --> 2865.44
right i have i have enough to say i

2863.839 --> 2869.52
don't

2865.44 --> 2873.839
need to add to my repertoire

2869.52 --> 2873.839
of saying things

2874.48 --> 2877.359
i appreciate it

2883.68 --> 2885.9199999999996
what

2888.88 --> 2898.0
you can be oh you want to come over

2893.119 --> 2898.0
okay sure we could do that sometime why

2898.839 --> 2901.839
not

2909.76 --> 2912.1600000000003
okay

2912.96 --> 2919.92
yes you can rwf

2917.359 --> 2919.92
romno

2923.52 --> 2929.839
still waiting for francis though

2941.2 --> 2944.24
ah he's back

2952.96 --> 2959.359
correspond they correspond

2956.16 --> 2962.24
with it are you saying

2959.359 --> 2963.7599999999998
the tides and the sun and moon cycles

2962.24 --> 2967.04
right back

2963.76 --> 2971.28
and forth letters i didn't know they had

2967.04 --> 2974.64
like male communication

2971.28 --> 2974.6400000000003
that's really fascinating

2978.079 --> 2982.8390000000004
yeah and i'm making a a joke about it i

2981.52 --> 2987.599
know

2982.839 --> 2987.599
because correspond

2987.76 --> 2995.2000000000003
how how do they correspond

2991.68 --> 2997.44
you mean oh there is

2995.2 --> 2998.64
some kind of cyclical nature and you

2997.44 --> 3001.28
could sort of

2998.64 --> 3003.2
put these cyclical natures just because

3001.28 --> 3005.2000000000003
they are cyclical of the tides

3003.2 --> 3007.1189999999997
next to that and then oh yeah they're

3005.2 --> 3010.64
both cyclical oh

3007.119 --> 3013.6800000000003
no they correspond do they uh

3010.64 --> 3014.24
how does that prove it has anything to

3013.68 --> 3018.96
do with it

3014.24 --> 3022.9599999999996
whatsoever how do these corresponding

3018.96 --> 3026.64
cycles lay a causal

3022.96 --> 3027.68
mechanical chain link the celestial

3026.64 --> 3030.64
bodies

3027.68 --> 3033.04
and actual physical activity that

3030.64 --> 3037.44
displaces the ocean

3033.04 --> 3040.96
called tides where is that

3037.44 --> 3043.44
in in your what you looked up

3040.96 --> 3043.44
francis

3047.599 --> 3053.119
i mean am i overlooking something guys

3050.72 --> 3055.839
i thought it was was pretty specific you

3053.119 --> 3055.839
know

3081.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
okay dutch seder take it easy

3108.839 --> 3111.839
ugh

3120.96 --> 3129.2
oh that that should be easy pam cow

3125.599 --> 3132.319
the more stuff is dissolved

3129.2 --> 3133.839
in water the heavier it becomes the more

3132.319 --> 3137.44
dense it becomes

3133.839 --> 3141.2
when it's saturated it's top weight

3137.44 --> 3143.44
so yeah of course we human beings

3141.2 --> 3144.8799999999997
we are not just literally a balloon skin

3143.44 --> 3147.2000000000003
filled with water

3144.88 --> 3148.0
not even just salt oceanic water no no

3147.2 --> 3151.2
no we got

3148.0 --> 3154.319
lots of stuff dissolved in that water so

3151.2 --> 3154.319
of course we're heavier

3163.839 --> 3169.92
but yeah we can also store gas in our

3167.44 --> 3171.76
body in a very specific cavity it's

3169.92 --> 3174.7200000000003
called the lungs

3171.76 --> 3177.0400000000004
you can keep air in there and thereby

3174.72 --> 3180.24
displacing the average density

3177.04 --> 3184.079
and that helps us to float

3180.24 --> 3186.319
and hey if we go swim in super saiyan

3184.079 --> 3189.76
water that's like

3186.319 --> 3192.88
filled to the brink of sellabili

3189.76 --> 3195.5200000000004
solubility then you

3192.88 --> 3196.079
wouldn't even need to breathe in to stay

3195.52 --> 3197.44
afloat

3196.079 --> 3200.079
because the water is going to be more

3197.44 --> 3200.079
dense than you

3203.68 --> 3208.0
anyway uh let's see if there's some

3207.04 --> 3210.72
progression with

3208.0 --> 3210.72
francis here

3211.28 --> 3220.6400000000003
blind denial provided statistics to show

3216.72 --> 3220.64
the cycles cycles

3220.839 --> 3228.16
okay no no it

3225.04 --> 3229.2799999999997
how is it blind or not i did i deny did

3228.16 --> 3234.24
i deny that there

3229.28 --> 3237.28
are some yeah cyclical natures to both

3234.24 --> 3240.3999999999996
celestial sightings

3237.28 --> 3243.3590000000004
as well as the title function

3240.4 --> 3244.7200000000003
yeah yeah they are both cyclical i know

3243.359 --> 3248.64
did i deny that

3244.72 --> 3251.52
no i just merely pointed out

3248.64 --> 3253.2
that you didn't provide a mechanical

3251.52 --> 3256.96
causal chain link

3253.2 --> 3261.2799999999997
between the two in order to tell us

3256.96 --> 3261.28
how they cause it

3261.359 --> 3265.7599999999998
cause and effect the effect being the

3263.92 --> 3267.839
tides water being pushed around

3265.76 --> 3268.96
where's the causal chain link how does

3267.839 --> 3272.24
it actually

3268.96 --> 3274.8
do that physically right where is it

3272.24 --> 3276.4799999999996
in your explanation francis i haven't

3274.8 --> 3278.7200000000003
seen it

3276.48 --> 3280.4
not the first time not now you just seem

3278.72 --> 3283.839
to be complaining about

3280.4 --> 3285.76
my interpretation of your evidence

3283.839 --> 3287.92
which obviously lacks the actual

3285.76 --> 3290.7990000000004
evidence that is required to prove a

3287.92 --> 3290.799
causal relation

3291.76 --> 3296.88
or at least to attempt to figure out a

3295.2 --> 3297.839
causal relationship because that doesn't

3296.88 --> 3299.44
seem to be there

3297.839 --> 3301.2799999999997
it's just like oh no no there's just

3299.44 --> 3303.839
these cycles of lights

3301.28 --> 3304.6400000000003
and then there's the cycle of the tides

3303.839 --> 3306.5589999999997
so

3304.64 --> 3308.0789999999997
yeah they both cycle that means one

3306.559 --> 3311.2000000000003
causes the other

3308.079 --> 3314.319
yeah but how how does it do that

3311.2 --> 3317.4399999999996
how did you measure that

3314.319 --> 3318.799
how did you actually figure out that

3317.44 --> 3322.16
they

3318.799 --> 3322.16
mechanically do that

3322.88 --> 3326.559
what's the framework for this what's the

3324.48 --> 3334.0
structure you don't seem to be

3326.559 --> 3337.6800000000003
presenting it

3334.0 --> 3340.88
mass affects other bodies of mass

3337.68 --> 3346.0
where are you getting that from

3340.88 --> 3346.0
i don't think so that's ridiculous

3346.24 --> 3351.9199999999996
that's not even officially claimed mass

3348.72 --> 3351.9199999999996
doesn't attract mass

3354.16 --> 3360.24
it's gravity yeah yeah it's outdated

3358.079 --> 3361.44
it's been outdated for more than 80

3360.24 --> 3365.68
years

3361.44 --> 3365.68
is it 100 years a very long time

3366.48 --> 3370.72
right that's not gravity newtonian

3369.04 --> 3374.64
mechanics are disproven

3370.72 --> 3376.72
officially they're only a model

3374.64 --> 3379.1189999999997
for conceptual training newtonian

3376.72 --> 3379.7599999999998
mechanics is only a model for conceptual

3379.119 --> 3382.559
trading

3379.76 --> 3383.8390000000004
also you might want to look into the

3382.559 --> 3386.4
history

3383.839 --> 3388.0789999999997
of what he did and said he wrote a

3386.4 --> 3391.2000000000003
letter to a colleague

3388.079 --> 3393.8390000000004
outraged over how people would

3391.2 --> 3394.5589999999997
assume that he would actually have the

3393.839 --> 3398.319
gall

3394.559 --> 3401.44
to claim a hypothesis over gravitation

3398.319 --> 3404.72
he adamantly rejected that notion

3401.44 --> 3405.119
elaborately in a letter because he did

3404.72 --> 3408.3999999999996
not

3405.119 --> 3411.119
believe in gravitation he didn't

3408.4 --> 3411.92
it was purely conceptual and he didn't

3411.119 --> 3415.76
want to be

3411.92 --> 3418.7200000000003
part of any reification about it

3415.76 --> 3420.96
yeah so yeah gravity is not mass

3418.72 --> 3423.9199999999996
attracting mass

3420.96 --> 3423.92
it's outdated

3424.799 --> 3429.599
right there's no actual evidence for it

3427.28 --> 3429.599
either

3430.839 --> 3433.839
right

3435.76 --> 3439.44
right so there we go again you i guess

3438.64 --> 3441.04
assumed

3439.44 --> 3443.359
gravity would do it isn't that just

3441.04 --> 3444.88
beautiful you have a correlation you

3443.359 --> 3446.24
have lights in the sky they have a

3444.88 --> 3447.76
cyclical pattern

3446.24 --> 3449.52
then you have the tides they have a

3447.76 --> 3452.559
cyclical pattern

3449.52 --> 3455.359
you say oh gravity

3452.559 --> 3457.8390000000004
did you measure that did you measure the

3455.359 --> 3460.88
the forces that would be caused by

3457.839 --> 3463.92
one mass going in proximity no

3460.88 --> 3466.079
no you didn't you just assumed it and

3463.92 --> 3469.44
then synchronized that assumption

3466.079 --> 3472.88
with two cyclical models okay

3469.44 --> 3478.2400000000002
well there's the trick isn't it that's

3472.88 --> 3478.2400000000002
how heliocentricism is held together

3479.44 --> 3486.079
correlations and assumptions

3482.48 --> 3490.48
there's no actual palpable evidence

3486.079 --> 3490.48
of any of it it's ridiculous

3492.24 --> 3495.5989999999997
yeah there is no phenomenon of gravity

3494.4 --> 3497.119
francis

3495.599 --> 3499.44
why don't you join the flat earth

3497.119 --> 3502.6400000000003
debates it starts in

3499.44 --> 3506.0
about 54 minutes from now

3502.64 --> 3508.0
go to discord get on there and why don't

3506.0 --> 3511.52
you present your

3508.0 --> 3514.799
your evidence for this with nathan

3511.52 --> 3514.799
he knows how to deal with that

3515.119 --> 3522.2400000000002
because you're spiraling in denial

3518.559 --> 3524.2400000000002
gravity is not a force it doesn't

3522.24 --> 3525.839
imply mass attracting mass there's no

3524.24 --> 3527.4399999999996
evidence for this

3525.839 --> 3529.44
that that actually is a thing there's

3527.44 --> 3532.48
not even a claim

3529.44 --> 3533.92
not by the original conceiver of

3532.48 --> 3537.04
gravitation

3533.92 --> 3539.76
and not by any official sources it

3537.04 --> 3543.2799999999997
doesn't happen

3539.76 --> 3545.6800000000003
gravity is the bending of space-time

3543.28 --> 3546.799
it's not a force you can think of it as

3545.68 --> 3549.7599999999998
a force

3546.799 --> 3550.96
as a force you can think of that right

3549.76 --> 3552.3190000000004
you're allowed to do that

3550.96 --> 3554.64
it doesn't mean it's right though

3552.319 --> 3557.44
because it isn't a force

3554.64 --> 3559.44
but you can think it you it's a rumor

3557.44 --> 3562.319
that's very tenacious

3559.44 --> 3563.76
right it's wrong though it's wrong it's

3562.319 --> 3566.88
not a force

3563.76 --> 3572.079
right and bodies

3566.88 --> 3574.7200000000003
do not attract each other over distance

3572.079 --> 3577.119
no evidence for this at all not even

3574.72 --> 3577.1189999999997
close

3579.92 --> 3587.839
yeah incoming i know

3590.96 --> 3596.73
phenomenon of gravity referring to

3594.319 --> 3598.24
things falling uh

3596.73 --> 3601.52
[Music]

3598.24 --> 3607.359
you are a noob buddy you

3601.52 --> 3615.839
are a noob you bought it all didn't you

3607.359 --> 3615.839
bought all the nonsense

3628.42 --> 3631.78
[Music]

3636.54 --> 3643.839
[Music]

3639.44 --> 3643.839
what's going on

3645.599 --> 3651.119
yeah hey pam kyle stop why'd you stop

3648.319 --> 3651.119
nagging her

3653.599 --> 3671.839
don't don't nag my chat participants

3656.319 --> 3675.839
thank you very much pam cowell

3671.839 --> 3678.4
yeah yeah simon then i do

3675.839 --> 3680.799
yeah all your reference frames are

3678.4 --> 3680.799
ruined

3681.119 --> 3689.04
you have no evidence of gravity

3685.839 --> 3689.04
the earth spinning

3689.92 --> 3699.04
none of it earth is flat never claim the

3693.04 --> 3699.92
geometric horizon earth curve only

3699.04 --> 3702.5589999999997
exists

3699.92 --> 3702.559
in the math

3703.2 --> 3713.839
internet issues ah yes it's still going

3705.76 --> 3713.8390000000004
thank god

3724.839 --> 3731.04
ah hey he's starting 8012.

3729.839 --> 3733.68
yeah i'm doing great

3731.04 --> 3736.96
[Music]

3733.68 --> 3736.96
denying math

3738.0 --> 3741.28
okay well francis you went from somebody

3740.96 --> 3744.96
that

3741.28 --> 3747.28
actually seemed to be halfway decent

3744.96 --> 3748.2400000000002
in the attempt to inquire evidence but

3747.28 --> 3751.76
now you're just

3748.24 --> 3754.5589999999997
you've just turned into a bald heart

3751.76 --> 3755.44
it's like there's only so many fallacies

3754.559 --> 3757.52
there's only

3755.44 --> 3759.44
so many fallacies i'm going to be

3757.52 --> 3761.839
pointing out

3759.44 --> 3762.96
until it's just like okay i'm done with

3761.839 --> 3766.0789999999997
this [ __ ]

3762.96 --> 3767.2
you got too much baggage too much

3766.079 --> 3770.48
nonsense baggage

3767.2 --> 3774.0789999999997
you're not really listening or giving

3770.48 --> 3775.839
feedback recognition of anything i've

3774.079 --> 3779.52
said

3775.839 --> 3779.52
shut up you [ __ ]

3780.72 --> 3785.7599999999998
let you go ruin your own reference

3782.559 --> 3785.76
frames [ __ ]

3790.72 --> 3797.1189999999997
you want to work to talk anymore huh

3793.76 --> 3800.559
yeah yeah where is the actual palpable

3797.119 --> 3804.0
empirical mechanical evidence

3800.559 --> 3805.039
that links the correlation of celestial

3804.0 --> 3809.039
cycles

3805.039 --> 3810.7200000000003
with tight cycles have you provided the

3809.039 --> 3814.2400000000002
evidence yet

3810.72 --> 3814.24
francis have you

3817.119 --> 3821.039
yeah i want to talk i want to hear you

3819.599 --> 3825.039
actually provide the

3821.039 --> 3827.5200000000004
physical measured palpable evidence

3825.039 --> 3828.079
like the field measurements that prove

3827.52 --> 3831.359
that there

3828.079 --> 3836.96
is a mechanical chain link of

3831.359 --> 3840.24
forces to prove that the celestial cycle

3836.96 --> 3843.28
caused the thing there

3840.24 --> 3846.5589999999997
some way caused palpably

3843.28 --> 3849.039
measurably the tide yeah that's what

3846.559 --> 3851.92
this discussion was about that's not me

3849.039 --> 3853.76
not wanting to talk anymore that's me

3851.92 --> 3857.119
waiting on you to actually

3853.76 --> 3860.4
provide the physical evidence

3857.119 --> 3864.079
not based in just another [ __ ] story

3860.4 --> 3867.76
like gravity yeah

3864.079 --> 3871.6800000000003
i want palpable measurable evidence

3867.76 --> 3875.5200000000004
that proves a causal mechanical link

3871.68 --> 3880.72
between the tides happening oceanic

3875.52 --> 3884.64
water bodies being moved in the fashion

3880.72 --> 3887.839
and the light bodies in the sky

3884.64 --> 3889.7599999999998
now prove to me provide the physical

3887.839 --> 3892.88
evidence the measured

3889.76 --> 3897.039
palpable evidence proves

3892.88 --> 3897.039
mechanical chain link

3897.119 --> 3900.6400000000003
between the two okay

3901.44 --> 3906.319
provide information and it wasn't going

3904.079 --> 3907.52
anywhere yeah that's because gravity is

3906.319 --> 3909.44
not proof

3907.52 --> 3911.28
just saying gravity doesn't prove

3909.44 --> 3914.64
anything that's not a

3911.28 --> 3919.039
measurable physical chain link

3914.64 --> 3922.319
that provides the evidence of a cause

3919.039 --> 3925.6800000000003
it's just a story saying things drop

3922.319 --> 3929.0389999999998
that's gravity is not a mechanical

3925.68 --> 3932.3999999999996
chain like how do things dropping cause

3929.039 --> 3934.4
the oceanic bodies of water to move in a

3932.4 --> 3938.1600000000003
cyclical fashion you tell me how that

3934.4 --> 3938.1600000000003
causes that yeah things falling

3938.319 --> 3941.7599999999998
it doesn't yeah no [ __ ] it doesn't

3941.2 --> 3944.799
there's not

3941.76 --> 3947.2000000000003
things falling causing the tides

3944.799 --> 3947.2
okay

3948.88 --> 3951.839
what is causing it

3971.359 --> 3975.119
so yeah why don't you try again to

3973.76 --> 3978.6400000000003
provide evidence that

3975.119 --> 3981.2000000000003
actually backs the causal claim

3978.64 --> 3982.4
instead of just saying something and not

3981.2 --> 3985.1189999999997
pointing out

3982.4 --> 3987.359
how that provides the mechanical chain

3985.119 --> 3987.359
link

3987.52 --> 3994.16
right provide the evidence

3991.2 --> 3995.5989999999997
something that can be measured right if

3994.16 --> 3998.319
you want to say gravity is

3995.599 --> 3999.839
things falling well how does that cause

3998.319 --> 4002.0
it then

3999.839 --> 4004.96
oh yeah it makes no sense yeah no [ __ ]

4002.0 --> 4021.839
it makes no sense

4004.96 --> 4021.839
i know you said it though

4032.839 --> 4035.839
uh

4043.44 --> 4049.44
oh no nigel arnold are you

4046.72 --> 4050.72
actually trying to guilt-trip good

4049.44 --> 4053.76
servant oversight

4050.72 --> 4055.4399999999996
calling somebody a dumbass

4053.76 --> 4058.0
are you out of your [ __ ] mind your

4055.44 --> 4058.0
[ __ ]

4059.119 --> 4064.0
yeah you know why god doesn't like

4062.559 --> 4067.119
swearing

4064.0 --> 4069.039
because when you swear a lot it kind of

4067.119 --> 4071.76
brings you down

4069.039 --> 4072.079
it brings you down into the gutter right

4071.76 --> 4074.559
but

4072.079 --> 4076.96
that's the point when you swear you're

4074.559 --> 4079.52
swearing down to somebody

4076.96 --> 4081.2
now if you then go spiral in continue

4079.52 --> 4082.559
swearing and swearing and more swearing

4081.2 --> 4084.0
yeah that brings you down that's

4082.559 --> 4087.119
something god doesn't like

4084.0 --> 4088.48
that doesn't mean you can't express

4087.119 --> 4090.48
yourself properly

4088.48 --> 4091.52
to point at something that is in the

4090.48 --> 4094.559
gutter

4091.52 --> 4098.719
yeah god actually

it

4102.48 --> 4106.08
he just doesn't like it when you lose

4104.159 --> 4109.12
control when you do that

4106.08 --> 4110.0
yeah so why don't you stop shaming good

4109.12 --> 4113.679
servant

4110.0 --> 4116.4
for just having honest expression

4113.679 --> 4117.12
i mean it's not like he's going full agm

4116.4 --> 4119.679
or something

4117.12 --> 4122.719
because agent sometimes like goes

4119.679 --> 4124.56
overboard is not doing it right now

4122.719 --> 4126.88
but then i point it out too right i

4124.56 --> 4128.799
don't see how good servant is doing that

4126.88 --> 4132.64
by calling somebody a dumbass

4128.799 --> 4136.08
when they're pretty much a dumbass so

4132.64 --> 4136.08
why don't you just leave him alone

4143.92 --> 4147.6
simon then shut the [ __ ] up with your

4146.88 --> 4151.04
math

4147.6 --> 4155.1990000000005

4151.04 --> 4158.56
out go ruin your own reference frames

4155.199 --> 4161.919999999999
just shut the hell up i don't want to do

4158.56 --> 4163.679
your stupid prefab math [ __ ] that you

4161.92 --> 4166.96
didn't even make yourself you

4163.679 --> 4171.92
just copy pasted it from some

4166.96 --> 4171.92
wannabe smart website

4172.0 --> 4175.359
like how to be how to seem smart for

4174.799 --> 4178.08
[ __ ]

4175.359 --> 4179.759
retards and that's your sources i know

4178.08 --> 4181.679
they are because you are one of the

4179.759 --> 4184.159
dumbest guys

4181.679 --> 4184.159
out there

4185.12 --> 4191.92
simon then

4188.719 --> 4194.159
and your constant gaslighting [ __ ]

4191.92 --> 4198.0
of how you're supposedly smart when

4194.159 --> 4200.96
you have no physical evidence whatsoever

4198.0 --> 4202.0
it's just that it's very tough for you

4200.96 --> 4204.0
to try and even

4202.0 --> 4205.44
prove that you're actually smart because

4204.0 --> 4208.88
anybody that's really

4205.44 --> 4212.0
actually smart doesn't even

4208.88 --> 4213.6
want to associate with you just to point

4212.0 --> 4216.88
out how stupid you are

4213.6 --> 4218.8
because it's so stupid what you do

4216.88 --> 4221.04
they just want to stay clear away and

4218.8 --> 4221.4400000000005
just forget that you exist because your

4221.04 --> 4224.96
very

4221.44 --> 4231.04
existence dumbs people down you're that

4224.96 --> 4233.679
stupid simon then okay

4231.04 --> 4235.679
so stop gaslighting yourself on how

4233.679 --> 4239.76
you're supposedly an intellectual you

4235.679 --> 4239.76
are one of the dumbest people i've ever

don't talk to him you only encourage him

like nobody should talk to him

nothing he says provides

any value in any form

4317.84 --> 4324.8
he's too stupid to learn from and that's

kind of annoying if you then when they

cannot answer

4373.84 --> 4379.12
start to ask questions right ballers do

4375.92 --> 4382.08
that [ __ ] all the time don't

just leave them alone

simon dan

never answers questions not really

4392.32 --> 4396.239
he might just answer a basic question

because he

thinks that by sometimes answering basic

questions that somehow gives him the

right to

4401.679 --> 4409.1990000000005
avoid all real questions

in english so i don't even know what

4592.719 --> 4597.199
those freaking words all mean

4594.96 --> 4597.199
so

4600.88 --> 4609.84
are you asking multiplication

right i remember that [ __ ]

4634.48 --> 4639.5199999999995
can't you do math i'm sorry i'm not

familiar with this english version of

it you piece of [ __ ] i never learn it in

english

4642.64 --> 4648.84
i learned it in dutch and i wasn't all

4645.76 --> 4652.8
that interested i did most of my math

4648.84 --> 4656.0
intuitively yeah do you understand

4652.8 --> 4659.1990000000005
i passed on math

4656.0 --> 4662.4
math with an a yeah i passed on it

4659.199 --> 4665.5199999999995
and i barely even went to class like

4662.4 --> 4667.44
the last year i literally visited

4665.52 --> 4668.56
active class with a teacher doing a

4668.56 --> 4676.400000000001
twice and i still passed

4672.159 --> 4678.639999999999
yeah so

4676.4 --> 4679.44
i don't give a [ __ ] about math i really

4678.64 --> 4681.6
don't i

4679.44 --> 4684.5599999999995
i know the tricks i know the mechanics i

4681.6 --> 4687.360000000001
just when you say something like

4684.56 --> 4687.360000000001
what is it again

4688.48 --> 4693.839999999999
i see

4694.64 --> 4700.159000000001

4696.56 --> 4700.159000000001
means factorize

4701.12 --> 4704.5599999999995
i mean i could deduce it but it doesn't

4703.6 --> 4706.64
automatically

4704.56 --> 4710.080000000001
ring a bell with the correlating dutch

that's probably the most tragic thing of

5113.44 --> 5119.12
all is most people that are

5115.12 --> 5122.48
really unbelievably stupid don't know

5119.12 --> 5127.28
how stupid they are you do

5122.48 --> 5129.28
then you know how stupid you are

5127.28 --> 5131.12
that's really the biggest tragedy of all

5129.28 --> 5134.159
because what you're going to do about it

5131.12 --> 5138.84
you just have enough consciousness left

5134.159 --> 5141.839999999999
to know how stupid you are now that's

5138.84 --> 5141.84
torture

5149.04 --> 5155.84
ah i love these shows

5160.239 --> 5169.839999999999
sometimes you just gotta do this sort of

5162.08 --> 5169.84
thing guys

5170.48 --> 5174.4
you know it's just like on a farm you

5172.719 --> 5178.32
gotta hunt

5174.4 --> 5180.32
furman and foxes and

5178.32 --> 5181.599999999999
or they're just gonna [ __ ] things up and

5180.32 --> 5184.719
you gotta get rough

5181.6 --> 5188.400000000001
so yeah i gotta weed out the weeds and

5184.719 --> 5188.719
you can't just like basically weed them

5188.4 --> 5192.719
out

5188.719 --> 5192.719
you gotta take them by the roots

5192.96 --> 5199.12
and hey maybe even demonstratively

5196.0 --> 5201.52
like crush it

5199.12 --> 5203.04
between a rock just to send out the

5201.52 --> 5206.4800000000005
signal

5203.04 --> 5209.679
to other plants like that

5206.48 --> 5214.799999999999
like yeah right there in this location

5209.679 --> 5214.8
you die get out right

5216.67 --> 5222.719
[Music]

5217.76 --> 5227.280000000001
so yeah sometimes you gotta gotta crush

5222.719 --> 5230.88
some wheat unroot them

5227.28 --> 5234.08
then demonstratively crush the roots

5230.88 --> 5236.400000000001
to send out the signal to other

5234.08 --> 5239.36
weeds like that you are not freaking

5236.4 --> 5242.96
welcome here

5239.36 --> 5246.0
and it looks ugly i know but yeah

5242.96 --> 5246.0
if you don't do it

5246.32 --> 5250.239
they'll just welcome themselves right

5250.84 --> 5253.84
back

5259.52 --> 5267.280000000001
no i'm i'm not mad with you

5262.719 --> 5271.199
francis i'm just run out of patience

5267.28 --> 5274.32
because you came in with a claim

5271.199 --> 5278.0
right and i

5274.32 --> 5281.92
analyzed your claim to the in

5278.0 --> 5285.92
detail and presented to you exactly

5281.92 --> 5285.92
what the problem is with the claim

5286.48 --> 5289.839999999999
and what is required to actually back

5289.199 --> 5292.638999999999
the claim

5289.84 --> 5293.6
and you haven't you said gravity and

5292.639 --> 5296.639
then you got all

5293.6 --> 5297.4400000000005
outreached and flustered and moved on i

5296.639 --> 5299.36
guess

5297.44 --> 5301.919999999999
right you haven't actually provided

5299.36 --> 5306.08
evidence for the claim

5301.92 --> 5308.719
you just use simon dan coming in

5306.08 --> 5310.239
as a red herring to move away from the

5308.719 --> 5313.76
fact that you have still

5310.239 --> 5317.28
not provided actual mechanical

5313.76 --> 5320.639
physical empirical causal

5317.28 --> 5323.599999999999
chain-link evidence for how

5320.639 --> 5325.92
the celestial bodies are supposedly

5323.6 --> 5328.4800000000005
causing that bulge of water

5325.92 --> 5330.08
to move which we know as the tide

5328.48 --> 5337.839999999999
phenomenon

5330.08 --> 5337.84
still haven't provided that evidence

5348.84 --> 5351.84
uh

5354.0 --> 5365.84
all right yeah i'll be back in two

5355.28 --> 5365.84
minutes guys keep

5446.84 --> 5449.84
um

5458.48 --> 5466.48
okay tiny wumbo how many flat earthers

5462.0 --> 5469.52
buy my idea well

5466.48 --> 5472.799999999999
you buy it or not there's no evidence

5469.52 --> 5476.159000000001
that the moon is physical though

5472.8 --> 5479.12
only suggestive

5476.159 --> 5479.12
interpretations

5479.199 --> 5487.839999999999
you know moon signal rebounds

5484.0 --> 5489.679
i made it an item where where is it

5487.84 --> 5491.6
where's the actual evidence that you can

5489.679 --> 5495.4400000000005
do that

5491.6 --> 5496.639
i i expressed or i laid out exactly what

5495.44 --> 5499.839999999999
would be required

5496.639 --> 5501.76
to empirically prove that you could do

5499.84 --> 5504.639
such a thing

5501.76 --> 5505.52
laid it out in detail several times

5504.639 --> 5508.56
there's a

5505.52 --> 5512.080000000001
an early bird show dedicated to it

5508.56 --> 5514.320000000001
with the title moon signal rebounds look

5512.08 --> 5516.8
it up

5514.32 --> 5518.48
yeah so there is no evidence that the

5516.8 --> 5521.360000000001
moon is physical

5518.48 --> 5522.4
and hey when it comes to things that you

5521.36 --> 5525.36
see

5522.4 --> 5527.599999999999
that you can't prove are physical well

5525.36 --> 5529.679
what can you categorize them at

5527.6 --> 5532.08
you know how do you categorize yeah yeah

5529.679 --> 5536.4
there's only one thing i know

5532.08 --> 5538.48
left and that's called holographic

5536.4 --> 5540.159
it's just light image it's an image of

5538.48 --> 5542.0
light and we don't know

5540.159 --> 5543.44
further information yeah so it's

5542.0 --> 5545.52
holographic

5543.44 --> 5547.599999999999
that's what's left when you have

5545.52 --> 5549.76
absolutely no proof that something is

5547.6 --> 5552.0
physical yet you see it

5549.76 --> 5553.679
yeah you'd have no other alternative

5552.0 --> 5554.96
left but to call it holographic and

5553.679 --> 5561.84
that's why i call

5554.96 --> 5561.84
it holographic

5566.96 --> 5571.679
moon is plasma yeah i've heard that idea

5569.44 --> 5574.5599999999995
dutch sailor but it doesn't work

5571.679 --> 5575.679
because plasma is a substance it's

5574.56 --> 5579.6
matter

5575.679 --> 5583.04
right matter has a proximity

5579.6 --> 5586.08
like plasma gas liquid solid

5583.04 --> 5590.0
these are all forms of

5586.08 --> 5593.6
matter matter is physical euclidean it

5590.0 --> 5596.4
has a position a perspective applies

5593.6 --> 5598.719
so if the moon was plasma that means it

5596.4 --> 5602.239
would have a euclidean position

5598.719 --> 5605.36
with a proximity somehow

5602.239 --> 5607.5199999999995
there yeah if literal material is

5605.36 --> 5610.4
involved and plasma is just that

5607.52 --> 5612.400000000001
that means there is a proximity involved

5610.4 --> 5613.28
it has the euclidean position it would

5612.4 --> 5617.839999999999
have to

5613.28 --> 5617.84
otherwise it makes no sense

5622.48 --> 5625.678999999999
so as far as i'm concerned it's just

5625.04 --> 5629.36
light

5625.679 --> 5631.76
now maybe plasma in some place

5629.36 --> 5632.799999999999
up there who knows whatever is up there

5631.76 --> 5635.84
completely

5632.8 --> 5638.4800000000005
out of reach maybe it has an

5635.84 --> 5641.12
influence on the manifestation of the

5638.48 --> 5644.5599999999995
holographic light of the moon

5641.12 --> 5648.08
but that wouldn't make the moon

5644.56 --> 5650.56
thing we see literally that plasma

5648.08 --> 5651.5199999999995
right so i'm not excluding that maybe

5650.56 --> 5653.52
plasma or

5651.52 --> 5655.679
something like that is involved i don't

5653.52 --> 5672.4800000000005
know could be

5655.679 --> 5674.719
it's outside a reach but it might be

5672.48 --> 5677.12
shadow change every day during 20 yes

5674.719 --> 5680.8
yes that's absolutely a part of

5677.12 --> 5684.639
the hologram nigel arnold it is

5680.8 --> 5687.28
that's right makes it very confusing

5684.639 --> 5687.679
right that's why they call it a lunatic

5687.28 --> 5691.36
because

5687.679 --> 5694.96
yeah it's very suggestive

5691.36 --> 5696.639
the moon the way it looks how much it is

5694.96 --> 5697.52
in your face compared to other

5696.639 --> 5701.04
celestials

5697.52 --> 5704.8
beside the sun it's very in your face

5701.04 --> 5707.6
it draws out your curiosity

5704.8 --> 5709.04
it's highly suggestive of some kind of

5707.6 --> 5712.159000000001
physical nature and that

5709.04 --> 5714.719
is very confusing and

5712.159 --> 5716.719
people have went nuts over it obsessed

5714.719 --> 5718.56
over it and that's why they call it a

5716.719 --> 5722.08
lunatic

5718.56 --> 5725.4400000000005
that started with that

5722.08 --> 5728.159
way before heliocentrism was ever

5725.44 --> 5730.0
brought to the wider public people would

5728.159 --> 5731.44
already look at the moon and have like

5730.0 --> 5733.52
but it has to be physical

5731.44 --> 5734.638999999999
why that makes no sense why does it look

5733.52 --> 5736.8
like that oh let me

5734.639 --> 5738.88
paint it why does it look like it has to

5736.8 --> 5741.6
be fizz right lunatic

5738.88 --> 5742.96
that was before heliocentrism was even

5741.6 --> 5745.679
educated

5742.96 --> 5747.119
before anybody really knew about that

5745.679 --> 5756.2390000000005
that already happened

5747.119 --> 5771.839999999999
they called them lunatics

5756.239 --> 5771.839999999999
because yeah the moon looks really weird

5782.84 --> 5785.84
right

5788.639 --> 5790.88
oh

5791.76 --> 5798.400000000001
francis gets back he'd like an answer

5795.119 --> 5813.839999999999
from me wow

5798.4 --> 5813.839999999999
i'd like an answer from him

5837.73 --> 5840.919999999999
[Music]

5852.84 --> 5855.84
uh

5856.4 --> 5869.36
do they steamy traveler do they do that

5860.8 --> 5871.1990000000005
i know they claim to do that

5869.36 --> 5872.5599999999995
all right yeah see you see you later

5871.199 --> 5875.759999999999
style in 80 12.

5872.56 --> 5883.84
thanks for being here i thought it was

5875.76 --> 5883.84
an amusing show as well

5884.48 --> 5888.32
right so steamy traveler yes it is

5886.8 --> 5890.8
claimed

5888.32 --> 5891.599999999999
by ham radio operators that you can

5890.8 --> 5894.639
bounce a

5891.6 --> 5896.400000000001
signal off the moon according to them

5894.639 --> 5897.92
how would that work well you would have

5896.4 --> 5900.879999999999
to

5897.92 --> 5904.0
have a ham radio and then a signal

5900.88 --> 5906.8
amplifier to say the least

5904.0 --> 5909.44
and then send it out and then supposedly

5906.8 --> 5912.400000000001
it bounces off the moon or

5909.44 --> 5914.799999999999
if you don't think that then there's

5912.4 --> 5916.159
supposed to be some kind of reflector up

5914.8 --> 5920.4800000000005
there

5916.159 --> 5923.36
whatever so they say and then you get

5920.48 --> 5924.08
a remnant of your signal back with your

5923.36 --> 5927.759999999999
receiver

5924.08 --> 5929.76
if things are correct right that's the

5927.76 --> 5932.96
claim

5929.76 --> 5933.4400000000005
that's what they claim how it works i've

5932.96 --> 5936.08
never

5933.44 --> 5938.638999999999
actually seen satisfactory evidence that

5936.08 --> 5940.4
that's a real thing though i've had made

5938.639 --> 5942.4800000000005
it into a whole item i

5940.4 --> 5944.719
did an episode about it i already said

5942.48 --> 5944.718999999999
that

5946.0 --> 5951.6
look it up moon signal rebounds

5949.6 --> 5954.8
flat earth early bird show moon signal

5951.6 --> 5954.8
rebounds you'll find it

5955.84 --> 5968.88
what's that

5966.4 --> 5968.879999999999
what the

5970.719 --> 5978.56
how to do it oh that's great

5975.04 --> 5981.44
that's just great they tell you how to

5978.56 --> 5984.2390000000005
do it and they don't actually do it

5981.44 --> 5984.239
brilliant

5986.639 --> 5995.84
they just talk about it isn't that just

5990.88 --> 5995.84
great thanks for that link

5998.159 --> 6003.28
steamy traveler just

6001.28 --> 6006.159
so you know they don't actually

6003.28 --> 6009.92
demonstrate doing it

6006.159 --> 6009.92
it's just blabbering on about it

6022.4 --> 6037.839999999999
they don't good servant they don't

6047.76 --> 6050.96
ah you do remember that episode you

6049.92 --> 6053.84
leave kevin on

6050.96 --> 6055.44
that makes me happy because i consider

6053.84 --> 6058.400000000001
it as

6055.44 --> 6060.0
one of the more grounding scientific

6058.4 --> 6063.28
setups that i have

6060.0 --> 6066.159
proposed right

6063.28 --> 6067.04
i'm very proud of making the details for

6066.159 --> 6070.159
them

6067.04 --> 6074.08
it equates to the proposed

6070.159 --> 6077.28
setup about testing moonlight

6074.08 --> 6080.5599999999995
whether it is literally something that

6077.28 --> 6084.4
injects cold or

6080.56 --> 6087.76
whether it has an entropy

6084.4 --> 6088.5599999999995
enhancing effect i made an episode about

6087.76 --> 6090.96
that one too

6088.56 --> 6093.04
very proud of that never actually

6090.96 --> 6094.4
engaged in the physical setup of testing

6093.04 --> 6097.92
it

6094.4 --> 6101.199
but it's it's out there it is

6097.92 --> 6104.4800000000005
described in detail

6101.199 --> 6108.719
there's a postulate and

6104.48 --> 6111.36
anybody could engage in that test

6108.719 --> 6112.96
to confirm whether it literally

6111.36 --> 6116.719
introduces cold

6112.96 --> 6120.2390000000005
into a closed off system

6116.719 --> 6121.44
or whether it only enhances the entropy

6120.239 --> 6124.48
in order for

6121.44 --> 6127.199
for heat things to cool off quicker

6124.48 --> 6127.919999999999
because that's that was the idea about

6127.199 --> 6130.799999999999
that

6127.92 --> 6130.8
behind that one

6133.6 --> 6137.679
i know julio pebb and they really didn't

6136.239 --> 6140.239
like i did that

6137.679 --> 6141.84
they really didn't like the ham radio

6140.239 --> 6144.5599999999995
challenge

6141.84 --> 6146.0
because yeah they they literally have

6144.56 --> 6149.280000000001
videos where they just say

6146.0 --> 6150.32
look at this look there's a thing and a

6149.28 --> 6153.36
computer screen

6150.32 --> 6155.36
it shows a graph and that means there's

6153.36 --> 6156.639
a signal rebound there's no actual

6155.36 --> 6160.32
variation there's

6156.639 --> 6163.56
not even a visual moon in sight

6160.32 --> 6166.5599999999995
in any of these videos it's
