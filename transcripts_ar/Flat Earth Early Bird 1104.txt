very intense video

251.76 --> 255.84

259.519 --> 262.72
right

260.959 --> 264.72
also yeah i've been watching been

262.72 --> 266.24
catching up on own benjamin i hadn't

264.72 --> 269.6

266.24 --> 273.52
distracted so i just started watching

269.6 --> 273.52000000000004
first hour of wednesday's show

277.04 --> 282.8
hello bill nye the science denier clutch

279.919 --> 285.75899999999996
elise g

282.8 --> 285.759
good to see you all

286.4 --> 291.19899999999996
coffee is good this morning yeah well

288.639 --> 292.32
not for me i'm staying off the coffee

291.199 --> 294.88
like

292.32 --> 297.04
me not drinking coffee yesterday was

294.88 --> 299.36
really good decision i of course felt it

297.04 --> 301.52000000000004
coming like days before but

299.36 --> 303.12
it's kind of hard to step away from a

301.52 --> 305.59999999999997
habit like that

303.12 --> 307.84000000000003
just one coffee in the morning right

305.6 --> 308.96000000000004
but yeah i'm not taking coffee for a

307.84 --> 313.11999999999995
while

308.96 --> 313.12
and i feel like so much more stable

316.56 --> 319.84
so yeah the ancestral winds are probably

318.72 --> 323.47900000000004
peaking

319.84 --> 323.479
concerning myself

324.08 --> 328.639
the yeah the prelude being wednesday

328.88 --> 334.8
and i'm just gonna like take it easy

332.479 --> 339.12
and yeah funnily enough

334.8 --> 341.039
since my finances like dried up today

339.12 --> 341.84000000000003
even though i did get a super chat from

341.039 --> 344.24
i mean

341.84 --> 346.0
a paypal from somebody yesterday i don't

344.24 --> 348.56
recognize him

346.0 --> 350.4
but i thank you it just didn't get in so

348.56 --> 352.479
like the previous days it would get in

350.4 --> 354.23999999999995
the next day and that's how it could

352.479 --> 357.44
kind of kept rolling

354.24 --> 359.44
but that didn't happen this time

357.44 --> 360.71999999999997
so it's going to be like a dry weekend

359.44 --> 364.16
for me

360.72 --> 366.639
and i'm okay with that

364.16 --> 367.68
especially since it's kind of a

366.639 --> 370.96000000000004
good

367.68 --> 370.96
opportunity for me to

373.28 --> 378.4
yeah

374.8 --> 378.40000000000003
to let it dry up for a while

379.6 --> 384.40000000000003
it's probably better for my health

382.0 --> 384.4
anyway

387.6 --> 393.03900000000004
right of course if you're gonna enjoy

389.759 --> 397.72
coffee then just enjoy the coffee

393.039 --> 397.71999999999997
hello mike sudenich good to see you

412.56 --> 418.479
it's by the way i've noticed something

415.44 --> 418.479
but it's weird

418.639 --> 424.479
right so there's some people some

421.039 --> 426.0
trolls out there that like to

424.479 --> 428.24
use me

426.0 --> 430.319
in videos

428.24 --> 431.52
to i guess shame flat earthers or

430.319 --> 432.56
something

431.52 --> 434.79999999999995
but they

432.56 --> 437.8
always take something that's just

434.8 --> 437.8
completely

439.039 --> 444.08
not interesting not shocking nothing

442.639 --> 445.919
it's like

444.08 --> 448.31899999999996
they try to make fun of me for being

445.919 --> 449.75899999999996
extremely boring

448.319 --> 452.16
i guess

449.759 --> 454.8
they think so because sometimes i have

452.16 --> 456.47900000000004
just waiting pauses i'm just staring at

454.8 --> 459.28000000000003
the screen at the chat

456.479 --> 461.44
not saying something

459.28 --> 465.67999999999995
i i think they find that more shocking

461.44 --> 467.52
than some of the other things that i do

465.68 --> 470.72
but something that's standing out to me

467.52 --> 470.71999999999997
it's kind of disappointing

474.08 --> 480.479
i hope to be able to absolve my gayness

476.8 --> 480.479
next week oh that would be great

483.599 --> 489.28
i mean

485.039 --> 489.28
you can never get enough gay away

489.84 --> 493.63899999999995
but yeah that would be great

494.16 --> 498.639
i really do appreciate this the overall

496.56 --> 500.639
support it's been like really fantastic

498.639 --> 503.199
and even though it's like not really

500.639 --> 504.96000000000004
working out at this very moment

503.199 --> 508.24
i'm not gonna blame you guys because

504.96 --> 509.68
you've been all super supportive

508.24 --> 510.72
and

509.68 --> 514.32
like

510.72 --> 517.2
in i guess emotionally supportive too

514.32 --> 520.6400000000001
so yeah i'm just not gonna

517.2 --> 524.08
get all victory about it

520.64 --> 524.08
because that's not healthy either

526.16 --> 529.76
and hey i got food so

530.8 --> 534.5999999999999
i'll survive it

540.56 --> 542.88
right

545.839 --> 551.36
right so yeah yesterday's flat earth

547.76 --> 551.36
debate was pretty good

554.0 --> 558.0
who got in there wasn't jose was another

556.399 --> 560.399
guy i think

558.0 --> 562.8
if i remember correctly i'm mixing it up

560.399 --> 564.959
a little

562.8 --> 566.4799999999999
sometimes i make a mix of what actually

564.959 --> 568.7199999999999
happened during flat earth debates

566.48 --> 571.2
because it is

568.72 --> 574.24
quite a few hours

571.2 --> 576.0
and yeah it's like every weekday so

574.24 --> 578.16
sometimes i mix it up but i thought that

576.0 --> 581.6
there was a baller on

578.16 --> 584.88
was it again oh yeah where's wally

581.6 --> 584.88
but he was just a troll

585.92 --> 593.76
like he eventually just fled

590.8 --> 593.76
just ran away

600.88 --> 605.92
let's see what else is going on yeah i'm

603.36 --> 608.8000000000001
feeling pretty stable today isn't that

605.92 --> 608.8
just amazing no

610.959 --> 615.1199999999999
no nervous bursts

612.959 --> 617.1199999999999
down there

615.12 --> 619.839
and i really do think it's the coffee i

617.12 --> 622.24
think the coffee has been just been

619.839 --> 624.48
negatively impacting me

622.24 --> 626.399
during the ancestral winds and i've been

624.48 --> 628.64
able to sort of take it but it's

626.399 --> 632.72
compounding and that's why not haven't

628.64 --> 635.4399999999999
drank it for two days and i feel so much

632.72 --> 635.44
more stable

639.36 --> 643.36
he disappeared really quick when he was

641.12 --> 647.5600000000001
addressed yes indeed

643.36 --> 647.5600000000001
oh hello bob and alice

647.839 --> 650.8800000000001
welcome to my chat

653.839 --> 658.399
right so

656.079 --> 662.4799999999999
i think i'm

658.399 --> 665.48
open for all kinds of discussions

662.48 --> 665.48
today

675.2 --> 677.519
uh

679.04 --> 681.519
let's see

686.8 --> 694.24
wow by the way this whole spat

691.36 --> 694.24
with jiren

695.04 --> 698.0
against

696.0 --> 701.0
jake the [ __ ] is like getting pretty

698.0 --> 701.0
intense

703.2 --> 706.72
the last video that was like

705.76 --> 709.2
dude

706.72 --> 711.44
he's like really going after him

709.2 --> 713.76
and hey yeah jake deserves it like i

711.44 --> 716.8000000000001
thought that

713.76 --> 720.3199999999999
jaren's analysis the going through the

716.8 --> 723.1999999999999
list of the psychopathic traits yeah

720.32 --> 726.639
that absolutely applies to him more than

723.2 --> 726.639
most people out there so

727.12 --> 731.399
i'm with jaren on this one

734.48 --> 739.9200000000001
south of france stuff

737.76 --> 743.639
have i looked into that

739.92 --> 743.639
oh uh

744.56 --> 749.3599999999999
did you link me up yesterday i think i

747.12 --> 751.04
forgot about that

749.36 --> 754.0
because there was already the other

751.04 --> 755.519
video in in waiting

754.0 --> 757.12
i linked it up

755.519 --> 759.36
in the chat

757.12 --> 761.44
so i watch that i don't know could you

759.36 --> 764.0
link me up again i will check it out

761.44 --> 764.0
this weekend

766.639 --> 770.2
hello ralph rodriguez

774.32 --> 780.88
casted many spells recently

778.88 --> 784.8389999999999
well that depends on what you mean with

780.88 --> 784.8389999999999
that bob and alice

787.76 --> 791.279
do you even know what that means

793.6 --> 798.839
how are the cult rituals go well which

796.32 --> 802.8000000000001
would that be

798.839 --> 802.8000000000001
exactly mr troll

804.0 --> 807.639
ah thank you clutch

814.56 --> 818.7199999999999
yeah

816.24 --> 821.519
i'll save that for later

818.72 --> 821.519
clutch thanks

823.519 --> 826.839
go to his playlists and you will see the

825.519 --> 830.72
ones

826.839 --> 830.72
what no ones

832.8 --> 838.16
southern france mysteries you mean

835.76 --> 838.16
all right

841.44 --> 844.8000000000001
cool yeah i will take a look

847.6 --> 851.519
you use your dagger for

852.56 --> 856.7199999999999
well my dagger is mostly just gathering

855.04 --> 858.959
dust

856.72 --> 858.9590000000001
right

859.76 --> 862.639
so

860.639 --> 867.6800000000001
yeah you're having all this weirdo

862.639 --> 867.6800000000001
fantasies but it's absolute horseshit

868.16 --> 872.7199999999999
i'm like one of the most ritually

870.72 --> 875.36
inactive people

872.72 --> 875.36
on youtube

876.72 --> 882.88
like

877.76 --> 882.88
i don't have rituals i specifically

882.959 --> 887.04
like

885.279 --> 889.68
didn't do that

887.04 --> 892.3199999999999
even when i kind of got into like magic

889.68 --> 893.519
and [ __ ] and occultism like i didn't do

892.32 --> 896.0790000000001
that

893.519 --> 898.8
for a good reason because i think it's

896.079 --> 900.3199999999999
pointless

898.8 --> 902.399
and that's even

900.32 --> 905.1990000000001
that's like 20 years ago

902.399 --> 906.0
i knew it was pointless

905.199 --> 909.3599999999999
right

906.0 --> 911.519
because any real spell casting

909.36 --> 914.399
the only thing that actually does that

911.519 --> 917.6
is the intention so rituals are

914.399 --> 920.0
literally kind of like uh yeah it's it's

917.6 --> 923.0400000000001
to focus something

920.0 --> 925.12
if you actually know what you're doing

923.04 --> 927.76
if you're just like following some kind

925.12 --> 930.079
of tradition that you don't understand

927.76 --> 931.199
then you're just fumbling around like a

930.079 --> 932.56
weirdo

931.199 --> 935.12
and you think you're doing something

932.56 --> 935.1199999999999
special

935.68 --> 939.4799999999999
yeah i don't do that

940.16 --> 945.36
i've never done that

942.959 --> 947.3599999999999
well it's not entirely i do do it on

945.36 --> 949.12
intuition sometimes but i've never

947.36 --> 950.8000000000001
planned anything i don't have any

949.12 --> 952.8
tradition

950.8 --> 955.8
ritual tradition

952.8 --> 955.8
anything

958.32 --> 963.1990000000001
like all of my tradition basically

961.279 --> 965.199
consists of

963.199 --> 969.12
looking at something at best or

965.199 --> 971.519
visualizing and then just realizing it

969.12 --> 974.0
like reminding yourself

971.519 --> 976.399
i have reminding rituals

974.0 --> 978.72
that's that's pretty much it

976.399 --> 981.199
please don't go spelling me

978.72 --> 983.839
well i'm gonna cast a band spell on you

981.199 --> 986.3199999999999
because yeah you

983.839 --> 990.0
you're pointless

986.32 --> 990.0
i mean i'm still gonna give you a chance

990.079 --> 994.399
it's just that yeah this stupid smear

1384.4 --> 1388.2
cold for some reason

1389.36 --> 1393.6399999999999
must be the moist in the air

1424.559 --> 1430.9189999999999
oh by the way just some internal things

1427.2 --> 1430.919
here over at arwyn

1431.039 --> 1435.52
yeah i did talk to my roommate the

1433.44 --> 1437.039
really really cute one

1435.52 --> 1438.8799999999999
again yesterday

1437.039 --> 1441.36
quite elaborately

1438.88 --> 1444.159
also basically referencing what happened

1441.36 --> 1446.9599999999998
on wednesday

1444.159 --> 1449.1200000000001
yeah she did actually hear it

1446.96 --> 1449.1200000000001
but

1450.48 --> 1454.48
it's like

1451.76 --> 1458.24
shocking how accepting

1454.48 --> 1460.799
her composure about it is

1458.24 --> 1463.679
i and i really do hope she's not

1460.799 --> 1464.6399999999999
intimidated i i definitely i like almost

1463.679 --> 1467.2
like

1464.64 --> 1469.5200000000002
get all humble like please please don't

1467.2 --> 1471.679
be scared of that like if you would walk

1469.52 --> 1473.279
in even if i would be like

1471.679 --> 1475.8400000000001
raving and mad

1473.279 --> 1478.08
seemingly i would immediately stop doing

1475.84 --> 1480.24
that if i noticed

1478.08 --> 1483.559
that somebody in my direct vicinity

1480.24 --> 1483.559
would be bothered

1487.84 --> 1491.4399999999998
but yeah

1489.039 --> 1495.679
she's she's so nice

1491.44 --> 1495.679
like i really like this girl

1497.039 --> 1501.84
i wonder if her boyfriend even knows

1499.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
what he's got

1504.24 --> 1509.039
in a way i kind of hope he's gonna mess

1506.4 --> 1510.159
it up then again i shouldn't

1509.039 --> 1512.4
hope

1510.159 --> 1514.7990000000002
if it's meant to be it's meant to be but

1512.4 --> 1515.679
yeah if i could i would i would make a

1514.799 --> 1519.12
move

1515.679 --> 1521.2
i really like her i like want to be

1519.12 --> 1522.4799999999998
physically in her presence not even like

1521.2 --> 1524.72
oh i want to

1522.48 --> 1526.84
squirt and all that no it's just i

1524.72 --> 1530.08
really like being in her

1526.84 --> 1534.0
presence that's rare

1530.08 --> 1534.0
not many women have that effect on me

1538.159 --> 1543.3600000000001
did most of them kind of do make me

1541.84 --> 1545.84
squirt

1543.36 --> 1548.24
if yeah but that's not i can't do

1545.84 --> 1551.039
anything with that

1548.24 --> 1552.24
they're all insane usually

1551.039 --> 1555.12
anyway

1552.24 --> 1559.039
yeah this girl is great she's decent

1555.12 --> 1561.4399999999998
she's studying for a doctor and

1559.039 --> 1563.44
and she really understands ethics and

1561.44 --> 1567.039
morality

1563.44 --> 1567.039
and that's just like epic

1569.36 --> 1575.6
and she's pretty hot

1571.6 --> 1575.6
it's just a bonus anyway

1580.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
could the holy land be somewhere else

1583.039 --> 1585.84
jeff

1586.88 --> 1591.6000000000001
it is very interesting though

1589.6 --> 1594.08
you know

1591.6 --> 1596.48
with rome being well

1594.08 --> 1599.279
right next to france

1596.48 --> 1601.279
well yeah italy it's pretty much right

1599.279 --> 1603.76
next to france

1601.279 --> 1605.919
just have to move past the alps and

1603.76 --> 1608.48
you're there

1605.919 --> 1611.6000000000001
and that kind of geographically would

1608.48 --> 1614.72
even make a bit more sense

1611.6 --> 1618.7199999999998
if you displace the

1614.72 --> 1619.919
yeah formerly thought of as jerusalem

1618.72 --> 1621.76
activity

1619.919 --> 1624.96
with jesus and the apostles if you

1621.76 --> 1627.279
displace that over to france

1624.96 --> 1629.679
then geographically it would even make

1627.279 --> 1632.08
more sense

1629.679 --> 1634.159
on a superficial level like that's like

1632.08 --> 1636.72
my preliminary thoughts that i got about

1634.159 --> 1639.279
it it's interesting so i am definitely

1636.72 --> 1641.6000000000001
going to dig into this it is very

1639.279 --> 1643.36
interesting and also because i've heard

1641.6 --> 1646.1589999999999
of this before

1643.36 --> 1650.799
like vaguely in the way far past when i

1646.159 --> 1650.7990000000002
did not have the real curiosity for it

1652.799 --> 1658.039
so

1655.039 --> 1658.039
yeah

1680.64 --> 1683.6000000000001
oh my god

1682.64 --> 1686.88
oh

1683.6 --> 1688.6399999999999
ro go rogue nitpicky

1686.88 --> 1691.6000000000001
right

1688.64 --> 1694.48
like nobody cares

1691.6 --> 1697.6
nobody cares that some guy who's talking

1694.48 --> 1698.559
about completely different things

1697.6 --> 1701.36
was

1698.559 --> 1703.84
slightly technically wrong

1701.36 --> 1707.52
about like detail that's literally

1703.84 --> 1707.52
nitpicking it's not relevant

1707.679 --> 1712.24
he's not i presume he's not talking

1711.12 --> 1714.9599999999998
about

1712.24 --> 1714.96
astronomy

1715.12 --> 1719.4399999999998
in that video

1717.2 --> 1719.44
so

1719.679 --> 1724.3990000000001
it's not gonna stop a baller though from

1721.6 --> 1727.9189999999999
being all nitpicky of course because

1724.399 --> 1730.399
only people that get every mathematical

1727.919 --> 1732.96
detail of the heliocentric conception

1730.399 --> 1734.799
exactly right only those people are

1732.96 --> 1737.799
trustworthy

1734.799 --> 1737.799
right

1743.039 --> 1746.1589999999999
yeah what can you do

1749.84 --> 1755.559
yeah

1751.679 --> 1755.5590000000002
hey seeking star wars

1767.039 --> 1771.12
yeah rogue nobody gives a [ __ ]

1777.52 --> 1784.08
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1779.679 --> 1785.44
well how about get the [ __ ] out and stop

1784.08 --> 1788.799
whining

1785.44 --> 1791.1200000000001
with your semantic nitpick detail that

1788.799 --> 1792.799
you think if you got it wrong that means

1791.12 --> 1795.1999999999998
everything is wrong because you're a

1792.799 --> 1798.84
[ __ ] bald heart [ __ ]

1795.2 --> 1798.8400000000001
now [ __ ] off

1820.559 --> 1823.559
hmm

1839.919 --> 1843.64
hey adam can

1850.96 --> 1855.2
yeah adam i've been watching that video

1852.96 --> 1857.8400000000001
you recommended a few days ago

1855.2 --> 1857.8400000000001
it was great

1858.159 --> 1861.0390000000002
but yeah you have to be in the mood for

1860.159 --> 1864.48
that

1861.039 --> 1867.12
because the because of the way he just

1864.48 --> 1867.1200000000001
makes that

1868.799 --> 1874.44
just the way he speaks is really weird

1871.12 --> 1874.4399999999998
and unnatural

1878.88 --> 1882.72
but yeah the presentation was very

1881.6 --> 1885.9189999999999
interesting

1882.72 --> 1885.919
very interesting indeed

1886.96 --> 1893.2
i'm like 10 minutes into the second half

1890.88 --> 1894.3990000000001
that's all about like the the time

1893.2 --> 1896.32
schematic

1894.399 --> 1899.279
the sun and moon it's really interesting

1896.32 --> 1900.32
i i never even realized that that

1899.279 --> 1901.919
well i

1900.32 --> 1904.8799999999999
every time i say that

1901.919 --> 1906.96
yeah maybe years ago as in 20 years ago

1904.88 --> 1908.7990000000002
i realized that and then i forgot about

1906.96 --> 1912.32
it again again because

1908.799 --> 1914.6399999999999
i wasn't that particularly interesting

1912.32 --> 1916.6399999999999
interested at the time it's just like

1914.64 --> 1918.5590000000002
okay that's weird

1916.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
didn't understand the implications

1918.559 --> 1921.84
didn't understand how

1926.96 --> 1931.679
how yeah why

1929.2 --> 1933.44
things are the way arranged the way they

1931.679 --> 1934.96
are

1933.44 --> 1937.519
i thought this video was very

1934.96 --> 1937.519
enlightening

1947.679 --> 1952.799
cool jim bob

1950.399 --> 1955.1999999999998
oh god

1952.799 --> 1958.32
yeah he's doing more like weird little

1955.2 --> 1960.3990000000001
deep fake snap it's

1958.32 --> 1963.399
it's hilarious last one was kind of

1960.399 --> 1963.399
disturbing

1980.159 --> 1983.159
huh

2004.159 --> 2008.5590000000002
yeah and these are all stock accounts by

2006.64 --> 2010.72
the way because

2008.559 --> 2012.399
i've banned these accounts and so they

2010.72 --> 2014.24
just pop up again

2012.399 --> 2017.12
make new accounts because they're all

2014.24 --> 2020.799
troll scumbags

2017.12 --> 2023.12
no life other than attempting to make

2020.799 --> 2024.32
others miserable so they just don't have

2023.12 --> 2026.799
to feel

2024.32 --> 2029.2
their own misery as much

2026.799 --> 2033.08
how freaking useless and lost they

2029.2 --> 2033.0800000000002
really are in this world

2033.519 --> 2038.24
they can't even

2035.919 --> 2040.0800000000002
change their own point of view anymore

2038.24 --> 2042.559
because they've just

2040.08 --> 2046.24
given in to so much slavery they've

2042.559 --> 2047.9189999999999
become highly inflexible on a mental and

2046.24 --> 2050.24
emotional level

2047.919 --> 2052.7200000000003
so they just spend their time trying to

2050.24 --> 2055.2799999999997
attack others that have not submitted to

2052.72 --> 2059.72
that level of slavery that's what they

2055.28 --> 2059.7200000000003
do that's what they're doing in chat

2068.639 --> 2071.7200000000003
all right

2086.879 --> 2089.839
what clutch

2094.24 --> 2097.6789999999996
ban hammer strong yeah but

2098.32 --> 2103.2400000000002

2106.0 --> 2110.56

2107.68 --> 2112.7999999999997
and i don't want to have that spoiled by

2110.56 --> 2112.7999999999997
them

2115.599 --> 2120.4

2442.88 --> 2447.92
i've heard some good reviews about like

2468.24 --> 2474.3999999999996
intense and surreal also with like oh

2471.119 --> 2477.6400000000003
it's again the the magic man what's he

2474.4 --> 2477.64

2482.16 --> 2484.8799999999997
so yeah

2486.88 --> 2491.599
doctor strange right yeah it's like a

2489.359 --> 2493.119
combi movie

2491.599 --> 2496.2400000000002
it looked

2493.119 --> 2498.319
and seems like it's interesting

2496.24 --> 2501.4399999999996
like it's actually a very good movie

2498.319 --> 2502.8
that also bring back like great villains

2501.44 --> 2506.0
and all that

2502.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
and really make work of it

2506.0 --> 2509.839
so yeah that's what i heard

2513.28 --> 2518.3190000000004
watched it twice okay well i haven't

2515.76 --> 2521.0400000000004
watched anything yet i just i literally

2518.319 --> 2525.079
just not even two hours ago was informed

2521.04 --> 2525.079
that is actually out there

2552.64 --> 2558.319
no spoiler no i'm not spoiling

2555.28 --> 2560.7200000000003
and like i don't really care too much

2558.319 --> 2563.2799999999997
because usually he's like oh big reveal

2560.72 --> 2566.0789999999997
like i literally don't care what happens

2563.28 --> 2568.3190000000004
i literally don't care what happens in

2566.079 --> 2570.5600000000004
the marvel universe or anything or how

2568.319 --> 2573.7599999999998
much it is accurate to the original i

2570.56 --> 2573.7599999999998
literally don't care

2573.839 --> 2578.0789999999997
if it's an entertaining movie to sit

2575.92 --> 2581.119
through i'll sit through it i don't care

2578.079 --> 2583.92
it's like not like oh no don't tell me

2581.119 --> 2584.88
because it doesn't matter it's all

2583.92 --> 2589.839
just

2584.88 --> 2589.839
movie nonsense it's all marvel

2590.079 --> 2593.079
crap

2594.64 --> 2599.68
and like literally in the making of it

2597.599 --> 2601.44
it doesn't matter because like yeah

2599.68 --> 2602.96
though the next guy is gonna make

2601.44 --> 2604.8
another movie and he's just gonna

2602.96 --> 2606.96
rearrange it again because that's what

2604.8 --> 2609.119
they all do like they don't give a [ __ ]

2606.96 --> 2610.8
it's kind of rare when they do

2609.119 --> 2613.28
right and in this movie i heard like

2610.8 --> 2614.96
they actually

2613.28 --> 2616.88
like it was made by somebody that

2614.96 --> 2619.04
actually appreciates

2616.88 --> 2620.48
the character and its history

2619.04 --> 2624.44
that's it

2620.48 --> 2624.44
i don't care about spoilers

2635.64 --> 2641.2799999999997
yeah yeah i love that character

2639.839 --> 2645.04
like it i

2641.28 --> 2647.44
from the original spider-man movies

2645.04 --> 2649.599
the really silly ones with the oh with

2647.44 --> 2651.119
the emo spider-man which is super

2649.599 --> 2653.04
annoying

2651.119 --> 2655.359
super annoying

2653.04 --> 2658.16
but yeah dark oct in the second one of

2655.359 --> 2662.839
that was epic it's like the good thing

2658.16 --> 2662.839
of that entire first series

2663.28 --> 2669.4
so if he's brought back exactly as that

2665.76 --> 2669.4
that's just great

2679.839 --> 2682.839
anyway

2709.119 --> 2714.6400000000003
oh wow you're all back from watching it

2712.0 --> 2718.359
as in it was released

2714.64 --> 2718.359
yesterday or something

2719.839 --> 2722.839
huh

2752.64 --> 2757.92
right so yeah dude i'll i'll take a look

2755.68 --> 2761.48
at that movie at some point

2757.92 --> 2761.48
i'll watch it

2779.359 --> 2784.72
isn't a new spider-man now okay

2782.079 --> 2785.52
oh in the comics

2784.72 --> 2789.16
that's

2785.52 --> 2789.16
seems to be happening

2791.2 --> 2796.16
hasn't really reached hollywood just yet

2797.599 --> 2802.56
but like comics are

2800.0 --> 2806.88
there's like comics out there that just

2802.56 --> 2809.7999999999997
push the like they really push sjw crap

2806.88 --> 2813.52
and like everybody hates it like

2809.8 --> 2817.2000000000003
everybody hates it yeah you get it sjw

2813.52 --> 2820.16
pieces is [ __ ] everybody hates you

2817.2 --> 2823.7599999999998
everybody hates you

2820.16 --> 2825.2799999999997
nobody wants it nobody no

2823.76 --> 2829.76
body

2825.28 --> 2832.5600000000004
and even like the the goons on your side

2829.76 --> 2834.8
they don't even care that much

2832.56 --> 2837.68
because the only difference is that they

2834.8 --> 2840.6400000000003
won't be squealing and whining like a

2837.68 --> 2842.24
stupid little baby over it

2840.64 --> 2845.2
when you do that

2842.24 --> 2849.5989999999997
but everybody else that's still like a

2845.2 --> 2853.0
cohesive human being hates it everybody

2849.599 --> 2853.0
hates it

2859.359 --> 2863.16
ah well done clutch

2876.24 --> 2882.0
come on jared sanford

2879.119 --> 2884.559
if you really care that much then that

2882.0 --> 2886.16
makes you gay

2884.559 --> 2889.76
if you really care so much that

2886.16 --> 2892.319
everybody oh they're all gay oh well

2889.76 --> 2894.0
since you're so focused on that maybe

2892.319 --> 2897.8
you're kind of gay

2894.0 --> 2897.8
ever thought about that

2909.119 --> 2915.359
i mean yeah the the long-term

2912.0 --> 2917.599
programming cannot be denied

2915.359 --> 2920.64
if you're the one obsessing over it then

2917.599 --> 2920.6400000000003
you might be gay

2921.44 --> 2929.0
right anybody that obsesses over gay

2924.96 --> 2929.0
usually is gay

2931.52 --> 2935.599
that's like universally understood

2934.48 --> 2937.119
right

2935.599 --> 2939.44
like i have

2937.119 --> 2941.6800000000003
homophobia issues

2939.44 --> 2944.7200000000003
i don't freaking spend all my time

2941.68 --> 2944.72
obsessing over it

2945.28 --> 2953.3190000000004
like i actually tried to avoid it

2948.64 --> 2953.319
avoid getting agitated by it

2959.28 --> 2961.599
hmm

2963.44 --> 2966.88
never what yeah but you know that about

2965.359 --> 2971.04
it

2966.88 --> 2973.76
george yeah you know about it you know

2971.04 --> 2973.7599999999998
you heard it

2976.319 --> 2981.52
so you haven't watched the movie

2979.04 --> 2982.48
but you actually know

2981.52 --> 2985.359
that

2982.48 --> 2988.48
in comic world spider-man supposedly now

2985.359 --> 2990.64
gay oh so you do know about it

2988.48 --> 2993.04
you just don't know the good parts you

2990.64 --> 2994.24
just know the gay part that's kind of

2993.04 --> 2996.0
gay

2994.24 --> 2997.839
george sanford

2996.0 --> 3001.92
why do you know that when you don't even

2997.839 --> 3001.92
know the movies that's kind of gay

3002.72 --> 3006.0789999999997
wrestling is super gay

3010.319 --> 3014.319
what's it called again mmf

3012.4 --> 3016.319
seems to be kind of like full of gay

3014.319 --> 3018.16
propaganda

3016.319 --> 3020.4
the own benjamin's talked about that a

3018.16 --> 3020.3999999999996
lot

3023.68 --> 3029.359
big news on bit shoot no no no no

3027.92 --> 3032.079
you

3029.359 --> 3035.359
think that was big news

3032.079 --> 3035.3590000000004
that kind of makes you gay

3036.16 --> 3042.16
yeah because who out there in the world

3038.8 --> 3044.88
is more exhilarated or offended or

3042.16 --> 3047.92
whatever some kind of a

3044.88 --> 3049.92
care some kind of form of care about oh

3047.92 --> 3051.92
this fictional character or this person

3049.92 --> 3055.48
turns out to be gay

3051.92 --> 3055.48
it's the gays

3055.52 --> 3060.599
yeah

3056.72 --> 3060.5989999999997
you know this is true

3071.52 --> 3074.72
ah new earth

3075.359 --> 3079.68
what is it about

3077.839 --> 3082.0
i've been subscribed to newer for a long

3079.68 --> 3085.359
time but a lot of what comes out of that

3082.0 --> 3085.359
channel is kind of like

3086.0 --> 3088.319
weird

3088.4 --> 3092.0
i don't fully trust it anymore

3095.2 --> 3099.04
they have some very serious exoteric

3097.68 --> 3100.64
roots

3099.04 --> 3105.64
in there

3100.64 --> 3105.64
that i do not care to entertain

3113.839 --> 3116.88
right

3114.64 --> 3118.96
that's right lloyd cole but that's the

3116.88 --> 3120.8
whole issue isn't it if everything

3118.96 --> 3122.96
becomes about who

3120.8 --> 3126.48
or what is gay

3122.96 --> 3126.48
that makes everybody gay

3128.559 --> 3133.3590000000004
right the real way to completely avoid

3131.2 --> 3135.9199999999996
it is to like have your kid grow up

3133.359 --> 3137.44
never even knowing what it is

3135.92 --> 3140.4
because they've never had to be

3137.44 --> 3143.28
confronted with it

3140.4 --> 3145.599
not oh i gotta tell my kid everything

3143.28 --> 3147.28
about what is gay and what is not yeah

3145.599 --> 3150.92
guess what's gonna happen

3147.28 --> 3150.92
they're gonna be gay

3156.24 --> 3160.4799999999996
yeah don't send them to public school

3158.079 --> 3163.599
yeah well

3160.48 --> 3163.599
it's got the point there

3163.839 --> 3167.92
because they will learn about what gay

3166.16 --> 3171.7999999999997
is in public schools in the united

3167.92 --> 3171.8
states from what i've heard

3180.079 --> 3182.48
is that

3192.8 --> 3195.8
hmm

3219.28 --> 3222.28
anyway

3264.64 --> 3268.0
ah

3265.68 --> 3270.319
all right light coil that's that's great

3268.0 --> 3272.64
rudolph steiner school walter school

3270.319 --> 3272.64
yeah

3272.8 --> 3275.92
it yeah

3273.92 --> 3277.76
it's not for free

3275.92 --> 3279.44
but yeah

3277.76 --> 3281.8390000000004
they're definitely going to learn

3279.44 --> 3283.68
something there also on spiritual levels

3281.839 --> 3285.04
it's very challenging

3283.68 --> 3288.64
such a school

3285.04 --> 3290.96
including for the parents by the way

3288.64 --> 3292.48
like if you're going to be like goofing

3290.96 --> 3294.7200000000003
around as if we're not saying that you

3292.48 --> 3298.0
are lloyd coyle but if you are it's

3294.72 --> 3300.5589999999997
gonna like reflect on the kid

3298.0 --> 3303.68
because at walter schools parents kind

3300.559 --> 3303.6800000000003
of have to represent

3304.799 --> 3310.4
you can't just drop your kid off and

3308.4 --> 3312.799
everything will take care of the rest no

3310.4 --> 3316.28
no that's not how that works

3312.799 --> 3316.28
you gotta represent

3324.24 --> 3328.5589999999997
yes yes yes yes

3326.0 --> 3331.599
field trips yeah that was great

3328.559 --> 3335.8390000000004
i have good ram like that part

3331.599 --> 3335.839
of the school i had great memories of

3346.079 --> 3351.599
in between all the terrible

3348.559 --> 3354.599
social situations that i also got myself

3351.599 --> 3354.599
into

3366.88 --> 3372.359
what is that i don't know what a bursary

3369.359 --> 3372.359
is

3389.52 --> 3392.24
oh okay

3393.68 --> 3397.0
lucky bro

3405.359 --> 3410.68
right bursary is like a grant all right

3421.839 --> 3424.839
so

3455.04 --> 3458.2799999999997
hey geoshifter

3461.92 --> 3464.319
okay

3468.72 --> 3473.68
health comes before education well

3471.04 --> 3475.359
without health there is not much of an

3473.68 --> 3478.48
education

3475.359 --> 3481.04
right you got to be healthy to

3478.48 --> 3483.359
to be open enough to actually learn so

3481.04 --> 3483.359
yeah

3483.52 --> 3488.16
i hope you don't get into trouble for

3485.119 --> 3489.839
that i mean like how are you handling it

3488.16 --> 3491.92
now

3489.839 --> 3495.52
i think that in belgium too just like

3491.92 --> 3495.52
the netherlands there's like this really

3495.599 --> 3500.2400000000002
this mandate like your kids have to go

3497.76 --> 3500.2400000000002
to school

3501.359 --> 3504.48
so how are you fixing it

3506.48 --> 3512.44
are you doing homeschooling

3509.28 --> 3512.44
for something

3546.799 --> 3550.88
all right keep us updated about that

3548.559 --> 3553.76
geoshifter i really hope that everything

3550.88 --> 3553.76
works out all right

3557.28 --> 3562.0
do i speak yeah that's

3559.44 --> 3565.0
none of your business troll i know it

3562.0 --> 3565.0
you

3582.72 --> 3590.359
yeah i'm good good to you lord lloyd

3585.2 --> 3590.359
cole glad that worked out for you

3630.16 --> 3633.44
do they also have bible school by the

3632.079 --> 3637.599
way

3633.44 --> 3641.52
because i had bible class in

3637.599 --> 3641.52
in my waldorf school experience

3641.76 --> 3649.119
i mostly used it for sleeping by the way

3645.76 --> 3651.3590000000004
but that's also because

3649.119 --> 3654.0
it did kind of make me feel comfortable

3651.359 --> 3655.2799999999997
to do that and we were not being like

3654.0 --> 3657.76
you weren't like being slapped on the

3655.28 --> 3659.599
fingers like wake up or something

3657.76 --> 3661.6800000000003
it's just kind of you listen and then

3659.599 --> 3664.079
you kind of

3661.68 --> 3667.04
drift away

3664.079 --> 3669.44
but there was at least bible school

3667.04 --> 3671.839
not that i cared for it that much at the

3669.44 --> 3671.839
time

3672.96 --> 3676.88
i mean i didn't think it was like oh

3674.559 --> 3679.2000000000003
it's all wrong or something i just

3676.88 --> 3681.6800000000003
didn't really care that much

3679.2 --> 3683.839
when i was really young

3681.68 --> 3686.16
like yeah but this is not about

3683.839 --> 3689.2
spaceships

3686.16 --> 3689.2
so i don't care

3690.16 --> 3695.96
oh i was so into sci-fi when i was a kid

3692.799 --> 3695.96
it's insane

3700.72 --> 3703.72
hmm

3718.88 --> 3721.88
hmm

3752.079 --> 3754.079
hello

3753.2 --> 3757.1189999999997
m

3754.079 --> 3759.52
c d x x hope you're not the next suck

3757.119 --> 3759.52
account

3759.76 --> 3764.079
like i don't mind spending all the like

3762.079 --> 3766.079
the entire show just deleting stock

3764.079 --> 3769.799
accounts for for the record and i'm not

3766.079 --> 3769.799
gonna even get upset

3770.48 --> 3777.359
i'm not gonna let it rob me of just the

3775.28 --> 3780.3190000000004
fluentness

3777.359 --> 3782.799
and my stability energy anyway

3780.319 --> 3785.2
so ah just got off from work all right

3782.799 --> 3785.2
all right

3793.839 --> 3797.24
oh man

3808.16 --> 3812.0789999999997
all right yeah one of the things i

3810.0 --> 3814.64
really liked

3812.079 --> 3816.88
at my waldorf school experience

3814.64 --> 3819.44
was that we actually had

3816.88 --> 3819.44
gardening

3820.079 --> 3824.9500000000003
like we had gardening school a lot of

3822.72 --> 3827.2799999999997
people there did like kids like

3824.95 --> 3828.72
[Music]

3827.28 --> 3830.079
i was like yeah

3828.72 --> 3832.0
[ __ ] yeah

3830.079 --> 3833.6800000000003
that's awesome just like my mother's

3832.0 --> 3835.68
garden

3833.68 --> 3836.839
like at home we had a garden too so i

3835.68 --> 3838.48
was just

3836.839 --> 3842.0
interested

3838.48 --> 3845.359
and one time we even like made

3842.0 --> 3845.359
like organic beer

3846.16 --> 3850.72
like a big project like a big casket or

3849.2 --> 3853.52
what do you call the big

3850.72 --> 3855.5989999999997
thing

3853.52 --> 3858.64
barrel

3855.599 --> 3861.599
and then like yeah

3858.64 --> 3863.7599999999998
real super organic like everything was

3861.599 --> 3866.88
ripped from the garden

3863.76 --> 3868.7990000000004
to make it

3866.88 --> 3870.319
my dad at the time because of course i

3868.799 --> 3874.7599999999998
was way too young said it was like one

3870.319 --> 3874.7599999999998
of the best beer he'd ever tasted

3884.24 --> 3890.319
yeah it was awesome

3887.039 --> 3892.6400000000003
it's just cool that they do that

3890.319 --> 3895.0389999999998
right there was all kinds of

3892.64 --> 3897.0389999999998
like stimuli to just like yeah you can

3895.039 --> 3900.559
do this you can

3897.039 --> 3902.7200000000003
it was like really trying to help people

3900.559 --> 3904.3190000000004
find like an angle to like okay you

3902.72 --> 3908.0789999999997
could be this profession you could be

3904.319 --> 3910.799
that profession and actually

3908.079 --> 3914.0
with practical examples

3910.799 --> 3914.799
so yeah i don't know

3914.0 --> 3917.599
like

3914.799 --> 3920.48
social wise my experience in that school

3917.599 --> 3923.119
was a train wreck many fronts although i

3920.48 --> 3925.28
did learn insane much

3923.119 --> 3927.359
because of it

3925.28 --> 3929.76
but like just the sheer amount of

3927.359 --> 3932.0789999999997
materials and processes that i had been

3929.76 --> 3935.4
confronted with in that school

3932.079 --> 3935.4
was fantastic

3943.52 --> 3947.92
yeah one thing that we didn't get to

3945.2 --> 3950.0
learn was about like computers

3947.92 --> 3951.599
there was no computers in that school at

3950.0 --> 3953.76
all

3951.599 --> 3954.48
that was disappointing to me

3953.76 --> 3956.559
but

3954.48 --> 3958.64
it's all fine because i had my computers

3956.559 --> 3960.6400000000003
at home but like

3958.64 --> 3963.0389999999998
they were really against that for some

3960.64 --> 3963.0389999999998
reason

3963.28 --> 3966.3190000000004
probably

3964.64 --> 3967.92
obvious

3966.319 --> 3970.5589999999997
now

3967.92 --> 3973.039
but back then i was like actually shamed

3970.559 --> 3976.079
for being somebody that played computer

3973.039 --> 3979.039
games at home which was weird to me

3976.079 --> 3981.3590000000004
it's very surreal

3979.039 --> 3982.7990000000004
then of course yeah i moved eventually

3981.359 --> 3984.0
to another school

3982.799 --> 3984.96
when i just

3984.0 --> 3987.76
yeah

3984.96 --> 3990.4
got out of that uh was it middle school

3987.76 --> 3993.4
was it even lower

3990.4 --> 3993.4
uh

3994.559 --> 4000.2400000000002
up until i was 12.

3998.079 --> 4002.799
and then afterward i went to

4000.24 --> 4003.68
well a little bit more jesuit oriented

4002.799 --> 4006.4
school

4003.68 --> 4008.5589999999997
and they had computers and they had the

4006.4 --> 4011.039
space and they had the globe earth and

4008.559 --> 4013.2000000000003
so i got my full

4011.039 --> 4016.2400000000002
gratification

4013.2 --> 4020.0
about that there

4016.24 --> 4022.4799999999996
it's really weird in retrospect that

4020.0 --> 4023.44
yeah the things i really longed for as a

4022.48 --> 4026.64
kid

4023.44 --> 4029.119
turned out to be kind of like useless

4026.64 --> 4030.96
in retrospect afterward

4029.119 --> 4032.88
while the things that i didn't really

4030.96 --> 4038.52
want to learn about all that much at the

4032.88 --> 4038.52
time are the most valuable

4049.2 --> 4054.0789999999997
i mean like i tried to just have fun and

4051.599 --> 4055.92
things but i didn't really like super

4054.079 --> 4058.7200000000003
care for it i thought like oh this is

4055.92 --> 4060.2400000000002
all so old-fashioned nonsense like i was

4058.72 --> 4062.48
like oh no we're going to go mud we're

4060.24 --> 4063.839
going to go to the stars um

4062.48 --> 4065.68
friendship they're going to have like

4063.839 --> 4068.319
computers in our bodies and we don't

4065.68 --> 4071.52
have to do anything anyway like i was

4068.319 --> 4073.52
like basically as a kid just totally

4071.52 --> 4076.559
transhuman indoctrinated but i did it

4073.52 --> 4079.44
myself it wasn't like talk to me

4076.559 --> 4082.4
by my parents or anything i was just

4079.44 --> 4084.16
naturally obsessed with it

4082.4 --> 4085.359
i was like just

4084.16 --> 4088.319
futurist

4085.359 --> 4088.319
totally obsessed

4088.96 --> 4093.689
not totally

4090.51 --> 4093.6890000000003
[Music]

4094.079 --> 4098.08
partially obsessed

4095.68 --> 4098.08
anyway

4101.679 --> 4107.279
you applied at the satellite company

4104.159 --> 4107.2789999999995
through a job fair

4108.96 --> 4111.359
okay

4117.44 --> 4120.879999999999
well

4118.799 --> 4123.199
at some point it had really weird

4120.88 --> 4125.279
experiences including dark world right

4123.199 --> 4126.879999999999
dark world is when that started in that

4125.279 --> 4130.159000000001
school

4126.88 --> 4130.159000000001
in that school

4130.56 --> 4135.04
outside the knowledge of any

4133.04 --> 4136.96
like principles or anything they didn't

4135.04 --> 4139.199
know anything about that

4136.96 --> 4139.199
but

4140.56 --> 4147.04
that's when it first started like yeah

4143.359 --> 4149.839
i get what this is i get this

4147.04 --> 4151.759
the misunderstandings and like

4149.839 --> 4154.4
the painting

4151.759 --> 4156.48
that is being painted through the

4154.4 --> 4158.639999999999
stories about space and all that and

4156.48 --> 4160.4
that it's not actually there that we

4158.64 --> 4162.4800000000005
don't know what is there

4160.4 --> 4164.3189999999995
like there might be something

4162.48 --> 4167.919999999999
but the stories that were made up i

4164.319 --> 4171.1990000000005
already figured out like that's not real

4167.92 --> 4173.4400000000005
but maybe something about it might be

4171.199 --> 4175.3589999999995
real at some point

4173.44 --> 4178.3189999999995
so i was just like yeah i want to be

4175.359 --> 4180.96
that i want to be one of these

4178.319 --> 4183.279
i want to help build this

4180.96 --> 4185.6
and then use that kind of as a cover

4183.279 --> 4186.799000000001
while we actually figure out what is

4185.6 --> 4190.799
real

4186.799 --> 4190.799
that was kind of like my initial

4191.04 --> 4194.159
career idea

4194.64 --> 4201.679
and then i figured out oh

4198.56 --> 4204.56
they all don't want that

4201.679 --> 4206.32
they all want me to go away they don't

4204.56 --> 4209.120000000001
want me to do that

4206.32 --> 4212.0
they want to drown in the secrecy and

4209.12 --> 4214.48
the lies and the reaping of the money

4212.0 --> 4216.239
from people for their lives and

4214.48 --> 4218.718999999999
that's what they wanted that's the

4216.239 --> 4220.4
message i got out of the other people

4218.719 --> 4221.92
that were actually interested in the

4220.4 --> 4223.44
same things

4221.92 --> 4226.88
and that was to me

4223.44 --> 4228.799999999999
a massive massive moral and

4226.88 --> 4231.76
psychological blow

4228.8 --> 4235.04
that made me basically dislodge myself

4231.76 --> 4237.1990000000005
from regular society when i realized i

4235.04 --> 4239.28
have all this power i mean the right

4237.199 --> 4242.239
thing i'm even willing to accept that we

4239.28 --> 4244.88
need to fool people to a certain level

4242.239 --> 4248.32
because they just don't get it

4244.88 --> 4250.719
but i'm not gonna become a freaking

4248.32 --> 4253.759999999999
demon

4250.719 --> 4253.76
like those guys

4253.92 --> 4259.76
and that made me realize like yeah this

4256.08 --> 4262.08
entire freaking world is based on people

4259.76 --> 4264.159000000001
that have done that that have taken this

4262.08 --> 4266.159
freaking ticket and just say like no

4264.159 --> 4268.32
[ __ ] them all we're just taking the

4266.159 --> 4271.599999999999
money we're just going to be rich while

4268.32 --> 4273.12
everybody else is stupid and that just

4271.6 --> 4275.679
totally

4273.12 --> 4277.599999999999
broke me

4275.679 --> 4280.159
i didn't really know what to do with my

4277.6 --> 4282.400000000001
life after that point even as i came out

4280.159 --> 4284.239
of school i didn't know what to do with

4282.4 --> 4286.639999999999
my life at all

4284.239 --> 4288.48
because anything anything i thought like

4286.64 --> 4290.64
i'll just build a career there it was

4288.48 --> 4293.199
always like luring in the background of

4290.64 --> 4295.1990000000005
my mind like yeah i'm gonna go there i'm

4293.199 --> 4298.32
gonna be confronted with these same

4295.199 --> 4300.879999999999
disgusting people

4298.32 --> 4303.679
that are then going to punish me and

4300.88 --> 4305.4400000000005
bully me because i have a free mind

4303.679 --> 4308.32
because i do

4305.44 --> 4311.919999999999
want to actually do something positive

4308.32 --> 4312.96
with the entire situation like that

4311.92 --> 4316.56
and that

4312.96 --> 4320.08
scared me off that scared me into not

4316.56 --> 4323.04
trying anything just keeping to myself

4320.08 --> 4323.04
drawing [ __ ]

4323.6 --> 4330.08
but really isolation

4326.8 --> 4332.08
it's because of that main confrontation

4330.08 --> 4335.04
in the school where i realized i have

4332.08 --> 4336.88
this power i understand a lot i even

4335.04 --> 4338.719
understand how other people don't

4336.88 --> 4340.08
understand it

4338.719 --> 4341.44
and i wanna

4340.08 --> 4342.4
help

4341.44 --> 4344.879999999999
not necessarily

4342.4 --> 4347.839999999999
break everybody for free but to keep

4344.88 --> 4350.4800000000005
things stable and to provide a stable

4347.84 --> 4352.0
virtual or esoteric staircase that

4350.48 --> 4354.159
people can

4352.0 --> 4360.199
walk up

4354.159 --> 4360.199
i wanted that i was the only one

4373.199 --> 4380.12
or at least the only one that would like

4375.84 --> 4380.12
openly talk about it

4394.239 --> 4400.32
you won the series yeah go ahead

4397.36 --> 4401.44
fine although that's already bad news

4400.32 --> 4404.719
because

4401.44 --> 4405.919999999999
fe is not really a question it's not a

4404.719 --> 4407.679
thing

4405.92 --> 4410.0
it's not a person

4407.679 --> 4413.4400000000005
it's not even an idea

4410.0 --> 4415.52
fe is a very vague designation to ask a

4413.44 --> 4417.919999999999
question about

4415.52 --> 4421.56
but yeah go ahead we'll see if i'm gonna

4417.92 --> 4421.56
ban you or not

4444.08 --> 4447.08
huh

4455.199 --> 4458.199
okay

4469.679 --> 4476.76
okay or just nothing fine

4472.8 --> 4476.76
all right be back two minutes

4559.04 --> 4561.28
yo

4562.239 --> 4564.799999999999
what's going

4564.84 --> 4569.719
on oh [ __ ] that

4580.96 --> 4587.56
yeah humpty dumpty ain't gonna be put

4583.199 --> 4587.5599999999995
back together again this time

4619.6 --> 4625.280000000001
no you don't need to know that you're

4621.52 --> 4625.280000000001
not gonna ask him questions

4626.0 --> 4628.88
you're just gonna ignore him

4628.08 --> 4632.0
so

4628.88 --> 4633.52
that he doesn't get the idea that he's

4632.0 --> 4636.4
necessarily

4633.52 --> 4638.719
necessary or wanted or needed in any

4636.4 --> 4642.0
form whatsoever for anything

4638.719 --> 4642.0
just needs to [ __ ] off

4642.48 --> 4647.04
don't ask him questions

4644.96 --> 4650.32
somebody's getting systematically banned

4647.04 --> 4652.239
in chat you don't address them you don't

4650.32 --> 4654.5599999999995
ask them questions

4652.239 --> 4654.5599999999995
okay

4681.52 --> 4684.8
all right

4683.199 --> 4688.678999999999
so

4684.8 --> 4688.679
let's see what else

4699.36 --> 4703.679
yeah but

4700.719 --> 4706.64
foxy waxy waxy

4703.679 --> 4708.8
it's not a baller it's a troll

4706.64 --> 4710.4800000000005
somebody that's making soccer accounts

4708.8 --> 4712.64
constantly and just

4710.48 --> 4714.0
being very annoying

4712.64 --> 4716.88
and useless

4714.0 --> 4718.84
that's not a baller right stone monkey

4716.88 --> 4722.08
is a

4718.84 --> 4723.76
baller yeah he's involver ask him that

4722.08 --> 4726.0
question because

4723.76 --> 4728.400000000001
he's just in my chat he knows how to

4726.0 --> 4729.84
behave he knows the rules

4728.4 --> 4732.96
that's a baller

4729.84 --> 4736.159000000001
somebody that continually makes new sock

4732.96 --> 4739.12
accounts to whine

4736.159 --> 4742.879999999999
and slander you don't ask them questions

4739.12 --> 4745.28
you ignore them so they go away

4742.88 --> 4745.28
all right

4745.679 --> 4750.56
doesn't matter how smart you seem how

4748.719 --> 4753.679
well you

4750.56 --> 4756.2390000000005
backed up the question you don't address

4753.679 --> 4757.52
trolls don't do that

4756.239 --> 4760.08
i mean it

4757.52 --> 4760.080000000001
don't do it

4760.4 --> 4764.879999999999
leave it for actual ballers

4762.88 --> 4767.76
because they are in my chat ballers are

4764.88 --> 4767.76
in my chat too

4768.159 --> 4775.639999999999
uh who cares i care it's my show and i'm

4770.64 --> 4775.64
telling you so you better care

4785.36 --> 4790.239
right so if like professor phil or

4787.92 --> 4792.08
whatever got in here yeah ask the

4790.239 --> 4794.239
question sure

4792.08 --> 4796.48
because professor phil

4794.239 --> 4798.4
knows kind of how to behave enough that

4796.48 --> 4800.639999999999
he's not going to get banned

4798.4 --> 4802.879999999999
and then that's fine if it's a troll

4800.64 --> 4805.52
constantly making new stock accounts

4802.88 --> 4809.6
don't address them

4805.52 --> 4813.280000000001
in statistically that causes them not to

4809.6 --> 4813.280000000001
go away you see

4815.6 --> 4820.400000000001
you always forget stone monkeys of water

4818.239 --> 4825.159
i forget sometimes too but he does

4820.4 --> 4825.159
remind us about it every now and then

4836.0 --> 4839.84
your account to be deleted what

4840.639 --> 4844.28
okay that's weird

4857.12 --> 4861.84
right

4859.28 --> 4861.84
anyway

4864.56 --> 4870.159000000001
this is quite an unusual show today

4867.679 --> 4874.12
i mean i started perfectly on time i

4870.159 --> 4874.12
wasn't sick at all

4874.48 --> 4879.12
only downside is i'm freaking poor at

4876.639 --> 4879.12
the moment

4879.92 --> 4884.56
i'm not going to be able to

4882.159 --> 4888.12
get beers

4884.56 --> 4888.120000000001
is what it is

4889.199 --> 4894.239
but yeah i could still definitely use

4891.52 --> 4898.4400000000005
the paypal support

4894.239 --> 4898.44
if anybody can miss it

4903.12 --> 4907.04
all right

4903.92 --> 4907.04
and by the way still

4907.36 --> 4912.0
thank you david i don't know except yeah

4910.4 --> 4913.44
not somebody that i'm familiar with you

4912.0 --> 4915.199
didn't leave a message in a bit but

4913.44 --> 4917.04
still thank you for the

4915.199 --> 4919.28
10 euro paypal

4917.04 --> 4921.92
you sent yesterday

4919.28 --> 4924.8
unfortunately didn't arrive just yet but

4921.92 --> 4924.8
yeah i thank you

4929.679 --> 4934.56
what her account gets deleted every 40

4932.239 --> 4936.799999999999
days that's crazy

4934.56 --> 4936.8
why

4939.92 --> 4945.1990000000005
vaxxy waxy like maybe you should

4942.239 --> 4946.0
like just do a video and upload it maybe

4945.199 --> 4949.5199999999995
then

4946.0 --> 4954.36
youtube will stop deleting it

4949.52 --> 4954.360000000001
maybe youtube thinks you're a troll

4958.96 --> 4963.44
do i invest in crypto

4961.199 --> 4963.44
no

4963.84 --> 4969.04
but i'll take crypto

4966.32 --> 4970.4
mess around with it i'm not particularly

4969.04 --> 4972.4
good at it

4970.4 --> 4974.799999999999
but hey if that's the type of resource

4972.4 --> 4974.799999999999
you got

4975.12 --> 4979.36
you know it's not gonna like immediately

4977.44 --> 4981.44
help my situation

4979.36 --> 4984.44
but i can potentially do something with

4981.44 --> 4984.44
it

4998.159 --> 5004.0
it was a good one yeah yeah clutch yeah

5000.4 --> 5004.0
i'm very happy with today's show

5004.8 --> 5008.88
and especially happy about my condition

5006.96 --> 5010.8
being better

5008.88 --> 5011.6
because yeah it's not fun

5010.8 --> 5014.159000000001
like

5011.6 --> 5016.4800000000005
waking up day after day and just being

5014.159 --> 5016.48
sick

5018.8 --> 5022.92
feeling

5019.92 --> 5022.92
unwell

5033.12 --> 5038.48
right well look foxy waxy

5036.0 --> 5041.04
what you could do if you really want to

5038.48 --> 5043.839999999999
keep your youtube account

5041.04 --> 5043.84
is make a video

5044.719 --> 5049.36
upload it and just keep the video on

5047.36 --> 5052.08
your computer and just keep trying to

5049.36 --> 5054.719
upload it like try to show youtube

5052.08 --> 5056.239
you're actually trying to make a channel

5054.719 --> 5060.0
and then they will probably stop

5056.239 --> 5060.0
treating you like a sock account

5060.639 --> 5062.88
guidelines

5062.239 --> 5065.12
and

5062.88 --> 5065.12
what

5068.32 --> 5071.32
what

5077.28 --> 5083.719
how does it violate your guidelines you

5079.76 --> 5083.719
hadn't even done anything

5088.239 --> 5091.239
weird

5108.159 --> 5111.159
hmm

5112.32 --> 5118.32
yeah well bit shoot seems to be doing

5115.92 --> 5121.52
decently it's not perfect there's they

5118.32 --> 5124.48
still have and censorship issues but

5121.52 --> 5128.080000000001
bit shoot seems to be pretty okay

5124.48 --> 5130.32
compared to youtube so yeah

5128.08 --> 5133.04
and it's been like that for quite a

5130.32 --> 5135.599999999999
while so maybe at some point like if i

5133.04 --> 5137.6
had to go to an alternative i originally

5135.6 --> 5139.4400000000005
thought like oh i'm gonna do like d live

5137.6 --> 5141.92
or something

5139.44 --> 5144.48
but d live is like really

5141.92 --> 5144.4800000000005
censored

5144.88 --> 5150.4800000000005
and yeah you can't really stack or keep

5148.08 --> 5152.639
your videos

5150.48 --> 5155.28
so yeah i might go to bit shoot myself

5152.639 --> 5157.52
at some point but for now i'm just gonna

5155.28 --> 5161.04
stick to youtube and

5157.52 --> 5163.120000000001
hope everything pans out

5161.04 --> 5165.199
comments on medical so yeah that'll do

5163.12 --> 5168.5599999999995
it

5165.199 --> 5170.719
you gotta be careful with that stuff

5168.56 --> 5173.1990000000005
i mean i do comments

5170.719 --> 5176.719
with me about medical stuff but

5173.199 --> 5179.678999999999
i don't like do full presentations with

5176.719 --> 5180.719
visuals and i don't draw in like doctor

5179.679 --> 5182.96
names

5180.719 --> 5185.12
if i can't prevent it

5182.96 --> 5187.44
i'll just kind of like glance through

5185.12 --> 5189.199
the subject and that doesn't seem to get

5187.44 --> 5191.12
me into trouble

5189.199 --> 5193.678999999999
it's really the times when i

5191.12 --> 5195.599999999999
really focus on it

5193.679 --> 5198.2390000000005
that got me into trouble

5195.6 --> 5198.2390000000005
last year

5198.4 --> 5203.36
oh wait not last year no

5200.48 --> 5203.36
earlier this year

5204.639 --> 5207.639
huh

5223.44 --> 5228.48
they censor your video well they're not

5225.52 --> 5230.639
censoring my videos as far as i know i

5228.48 --> 5233.12
i don't think i'm like being recommended

5230.639 --> 5235.28
or anything

5233.12 --> 5235.28
but

5236.48 --> 5240.959999999999
like from the

5238.719 --> 5243.199
well literally over a thousand videos

5240.96 --> 5244.159
i've done

5243.199 --> 5247.12
maybe

5244.159 --> 5250.36
like four in total have been removed at

5247.12 --> 5250.36
some point

5254.4 --> 5258.32
even though yeah i do

5256.32 --> 5261.679
talk about

5258.32 --> 5264.239
important things and heavily

5261.679 --> 5267.92
and i do sometimes like quickly ramp

5264.239 --> 5271.44
through very detailed like little tool

5267.92 --> 5273.12
like information tools that i know like

5271.44 --> 5275.599999999999
exactly the way i'm saying it is going

5273.12 --> 5278.08
to be very useful like in the next few

5275.6 --> 5278.08
years

5278.96 --> 5285.6
or i'll i'll dig into a subject like

5281.52 --> 5288.400000000001
yeah i have serious doubt that even the

5285.6 --> 5288.400000000001
germ theory

5288.48 --> 5292.638999999999
that it's actually scientifically proven

5291.04 --> 5294.8
without fraud

5292.639 --> 5298.08
like i'll bring that forth i'll i'll

5294.8 --> 5300.639
graph that into my opinion of things and

5298.08 --> 5304.76
my explanations i don't seem to get into

5300.639 --> 5304.76
too much trouble over it

5310.159 --> 5313.36
it was just clips yeah

5314.8 --> 5321.84
oh my god yeah that doesn't work

5318.159 --> 5326.32
you can't do that you can't just show

5321.84 --> 5328.96
clips of news and that sort of [ __ ]

5326.32 --> 5331.599999999999
that's what you get banned for duh why

5328.96 --> 5333.28
do you think i never do that

5331.6 --> 5334.400000000001
ever

5333.28 --> 5337.44
ever

5334.4 --> 5340.159
i'll describe it in detail i'll even put

5337.44 --> 5344.239
the link in the chat i will never show

5340.159 --> 5345.5199999999995
some news report video ever

5344.239 --> 5348.48
ever

5345.52 --> 5351.1990000000005
because that is what gets you removed

5348.48 --> 5353.5199999999995
from youtube that's what they do

5351.199 --> 5355.759999999999
you can't do that if you do that you're

5353.52 --> 5360.360000000001
gonna get removed you're gonna have to

5355.76 --> 5360.360000000001
find another way to communicate it

5366.639 --> 5373.28
doesn't matter if you got the clips from

5370.0 --> 5375.679
youtube that's not relevant

5373.28 --> 5375.679
at all

5375.76 --> 5380.400000000001
it's the fact you are showing news clips

5380.8 --> 5384.719
that's the thing that matters it doesn't

5382.4 --> 5387.12
matter that somebody else on youtube is

5384.719 --> 5389.04
fully licensed to do that constantly

5387.12 --> 5390.32
without any interrupt that doesn't

5389.04 --> 5393.76
matter

5390.32 --> 5397.92
it's not fair it wasn't fair it's not

5393.76 --> 5401.1990000000005
gonna be fair to expect this to be fair

5397.92 --> 5404.0
is stupid and a waste of your time

5401.199 --> 5407.239
you just gotta do it the way you need to

5404.0 --> 5407.239
do it

5410.4 --> 5414.08
yeah well if you don't care you're not

5412.56 --> 5416.080000000001
about money from just spreading info

5414.08 --> 5417.04
yeah and then you get banned because so

5416.08 --> 5419.199
yeah

5417.04 --> 5421.44
have fun with that you know just want to

5419.199 --> 5422.48
spread info yeah and then you get banned

5421.44 --> 5423.28
right

5422.48 --> 5427.12
so

5423.28 --> 5427.92
you could potentially spread the info

5427.12 --> 5430.88
and

5427.92 --> 5433.52
not get banned

5430.88 --> 5436.08
right you might want to look into it

5433.52 --> 5438.0
instead of just being lazy and saying no

5436.08 --> 5440.32
i just want to spread this just like oh

5438.0 --> 5443.28
copy paste oh here's the clip yep and

5440.32 --> 5444.96
then you get bands

5443.28 --> 5448.199
don't do that

5444.96 --> 5448.199
it's pointless

5448.719 --> 5452.0
just

5449.44 --> 5454.5599999999995
link to the video

5452.0 --> 5457.199
don't show it on your channel

5454.56 --> 5460.76
that gets you banned you know that now

5457.199 --> 5460.759999999999
don't do it

5463.52 --> 5468.719
why post videos on [ __ ] yeah right and

5465.6 --> 5472.4800000000005
beat you that's easier

5468.719 --> 5472.4800000000005
give you less hassle for doing that

5473.199 --> 5478.4
but it still

5474.639 --> 5481.04
can be risky if it's really like on

5478.4 --> 5482.96
point in the moment very very relevant

5481.04 --> 5486.92
they will still come after you at some

5482.96 --> 5486.92
point if you keep doing that

5509.76 --> 5512.92
all right

5520.56 --> 5526.320000000001
you've made legit ass [ __ ]

5524.0 --> 5526.32
okay

5528.96 --> 5535.52
well i'd like to say i like to think

5531.36 --> 5539.36
that i make legit ass [ __ ] too

5535.52 --> 5539.360000000001
i've contributed a whole bunch

5540.56 --> 5545.52
oh you found the dead astronaut

5542.8 --> 5547.12
no one could find

5545.52 --> 5550.2390000000005
really

5547.12 --> 5550.239
okay that's interesting

5552.159 --> 5556.839999999999
big chance of go okay well good for you

5561.36 --> 5565.799999999999
with no credit okay that's a bummer

5603.679 --> 5610.4800000000005
i'm not okay hey dude i'm sorry if i

5607.52 --> 5613.679
insulted your grandiose work

5610.48 --> 5615.44
that was copied without credit okay

5613.679 --> 5617.76
i didn't know all that i'm just talking

5615.44 --> 5621.28
in general if you really want to be like

5617.76 --> 5623.1990000000005
oh i'm so on point i'm so relevant

5621.28 --> 5625.199
i'm trying to reach out to millions of

5623.199 --> 5627.839999999999
people yeah that's when they come after

5625.199 --> 5629.12
you especially if you start

5627.84 --> 5631.92
using

5629.12 --> 5635.5199999999995
video clips from news channels in your

5631.92 --> 5635.52
video it's risky

5636.88 --> 5644.28
right i don't expect that to happen to

5639.679 --> 5644.28
me because i don't do that

5644.56 --> 5648.56
i'll just

5645.679 --> 5650.4800000000005
verbally explain it and maybe put a link

5648.56 --> 5654.8
that's what i do

5650.48 --> 5654.799999999999
that way yeah my channel is still here

5657.76 --> 5661.76
that's all

5659.92 --> 5663.6
i'm not saying that you're like

5661.76 --> 5665.76
incompetent or anything i'm just saying

5663.6 --> 5669.4800000000005
like yeah you gotta realize how this

5665.76 --> 5669.4800000000005
game works now

5677.199 --> 5682.32
you must understand fair used to use it

5680.08 --> 5685.04
yeah but sometimes even they don't

5682.32 --> 5690.199
really even care if it's just too on

5685.04 --> 5690.199
point they'll just take you down anyway

5724.08 --> 5728.719
right yeah lloyd call yeah that's right

5726.239 --> 5731.04
the fair use system is but it's very

5728.719 --> 5733.92
specific though right you got to be like

5731.04 --> 5733.92
reviewing it

5736.159 --> 5740.48
but if you're like making like a

5738.04 --> 5743.28
sensationalist type of presentation with

5740.48 --> 5745.839999999999
music and you're using video clips of

5743.28 --> 5748.5599999999995
other news channels or whatever

5745.84 --> 5751.52
that's much more risky

5748.56 --> 5754.0
they go after that

5751.52 --> 5758.2390000000005
but yeah if you're just like a guy

5754.0 --> 5759.04
like me on on youtube live and you're

5758.239 --> 5761.599999999999
like

5759.04 --> 5763.92
okay i want to like review this or

5761.6 --> 5766.4800000000005
something this guy's done

5763.92 --> 5769.76
yeah then the fair use system applies

5766.48 --> 5771.44
and that shouldn't get you into trouble

5769.76 --> 5775.1990000000005
if you're gonna like

5771.44 --> 5778.0
actually do news reports reviews

5775.199 --> 5778.0
that's different

5781.36 --> 5785.719
because they do come after you

5796.84 --> 5800.639
exactly

5798.48 --> 5803.678999999999
all right that that's all that's all i

5800.639 --> 5803.679
was trying to convey

5806.48 --> 5810.959999999999
the vices government propaganda

5809.36 --> 5812.639
probably

5810.96 --> 5814.96
he didn't realize that nathan oakley

5812.639 --> 5818.2390000000005
also got on vice once right

5814.96 --> 5818.2390000000005
it's pretty good interview

5820.08 --> 5824.28
a while back a few years ago

5847.6 --> 5852.08
right

5848.8 --> 5852.08
i think i'm going to round out the

5853.76 --> 5857.360000000001
i show everybody's doing okay

5858.239 --> 5863.04
i think it was a good show today

5860.48 --> 5866.0
interesting conversations

5863.04 --> 5869.28
my new troll nuisance but didn't really

5866.0 --> 5871.36
get in my way too much

5869.28 --> 5873.36
because when i feel this good it's just

5871.36 --> 5876.5599999999995
like ben and i don't literally don't

5873.36 --> 5878.5599999999995
feel it i don't even remember it

5876.56 --> 5881.96
it doesn't faze me at all

5878.56 --> 5881.96
when i'm strong

5882.4 --> 5887.119
all right anyway

5884.4 --> 5889.36

5887.119 --> 5891.36
