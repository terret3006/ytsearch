82.799 --> 89.42
so the weather today

85.979 --> 89.42
is quite beautiful

90.479 --> 95.1
seems like the

92.46 --> 97.74
sky has cleared up some more it's even

95.1 --> 101.03999999999999
more blue than it was yesterday

97.74 --> 103.19999999999999
and it's really beautiful like the sun

101.04 --> 106.86000000000001
is very intense

103.2 --> 108.72
and the the winds is like really nice

106.86 --> 113.579
and fresh

108.72 --> 116.03999999999999
like it's a cool breeze it's a real Joy

113.579 --> 118.69999999999999
in the shadows you can really cool off

116.04 --> 118.7
with that wind

118.86 --> 123.78
and then you can just step into the Sun

120.899 --> 125.82000000000001
and warm straight back up

123.78 --> 129.3
so it's really beautiful weather out

125.82 --> 132.599
there this is like excellent weather to

129.3 --> 134.09900000000002
go out and take a nice long walk in the

132.599 --> 137.33999999999997
forest

134.099 --> 139.64
or the park where where at whatever is

137.34 --> 141.959
there over

139.64 --> 144.98
whatever is there

141.959 --> 144.98
where you're at

145.44 --> 150.85999999999999
um words so difficult sometimes to get

148.02 --> 150.86
them in a straight order

151.319 --> 154.61999999999998
right

153.239 --> 157.26
so

154.62 --> 159.12
Little Rocket blimps first in chat Stone

157.26 --> 161.28
monkey 3D

159.12 --> 164.48000000000002
good to see you in chat Nathan Oakley

161.28 --> 164.48
1980 welcome

it is Thursday the 22nd of July 2021

173.879 --> 179.35999999999999
back to the new normal or back to New

177.06 --> 179.36
Normal

180.379 --> 186.78
so I almost thought I wasn't gonna have

182.879 --> 190.5
a title card and then I thought hey wait

186.78 --> 193.2
got this amazing picture from

190.5 --> 195.86
from the early Black Swan days I didn't

193.2 --> 195.85999999999999
even make it

196.5 --> 201.0
and I'll just take that

198.959 --> 204.48
maybe I'll just

201.0 --> 207.36
Photoshop some text over it and then

204.48 --> 209.099
and then edit it in back afterward after

207.36 --> 211.37900000000002
the show is over but for now it's just

209.099 --> 213.67999999999998
that picture it's just good enough on

211.379 --> 213.67999999999998
its own

215.159 --> 221.0
hello Cleary James Mason good to see you

237.18 --> 241.34
right someone I've been up to

241.62 --> 246.62
oh no notes stupid

251.819 --> 254.23899999999998
right

256.38 --> 261.68
yeah yesterday's weather debate was

259.019 --> 261.68
really awesome

262.919 --> 267.419
like

264.12 --> 269.46
it lasted one and a half hour so

267.419 --> 271.74
that was a it was a really interesting

269.46 --> 274.88
show yesterday one for the books can't

271.74 --> 274.88
wait to hear it back

276.38 --> 283.199
how about Bezos rocket Oh you mean like

279.6 --> 286.139
literally everybody else this is but yes

283.199 --> 287.16
I did kind of want a Bezos rocket

286.139 --> 290.759
picture

287.16 --> 292.8
now Owen Benjamin's latest stream from

290.759 --> 295.199
yesterday

292.8 --> 297.72
pretty much had exactly the title

295.199 --> 299.88
picture that I kind of had in mind so

297.72 --> 302.3
it's like okay

299.88 --> 302.3
right

303.479 --> 308.039
so that was just exactly what I was

306.06 --> 311.94
thinking

308.039 --> 314.52
but yeah he or whoever is working on his

311.94 --> 316.699
title cards actually made it and I

314.52 --> 316.69899999999996
didn't

318.6 --> 321.86
see if I can show it

333.479 --> 340.74
all right see that's his latest stream

337.38 --> 343.32
yeah Bezos and a penis rocket and it

340.74 --> 345.3
like I have watched only like what is it

343.32 --> 347.88
20 minutes of that show

345.3 --> 351.979
so far but it yeah that's

347.88 --> 351.979
pretty much the gist of it

354.12 --> 358.08
of course

355.8 --> 360.419
talking about such things that's exactly

358.08 --> 364.15999999999997
what Owen Benjamin

360.419 --> 364.15999999999997
oh his shows are for us

365.46 --> 370.09999999999997
no holds no hold bars

370.319 --> 376.44
man I am really shitty in my uh

374.28 --> 378.23999999999995
my communication skills today but

376.44 --> 381.38
whatever man

378.24 --> 381.38
let's move on

381.84 --> 389.65999999999997
hey good servant

384.84 --> 389.65999999999997
right away old horse rat born

398.34 --> 402.65999999999997
right so now I've heard that even Neil

401.039 --> 405.24
deGrasse Tyson

402.66 --> 407.88000000000005
has said that

405.24 --> 410.90000000000003
that Bezos didn't actually go into space

407.88 --> 410.9
so and yeah

411.66 --> 417.72
you know if

414.0 --> 420.24
if Joe Rogan even got is going to

417.72 --> 425.96000000000004
come forward with that then yeah

420.24 --> 425.96000000000004
then why not Neil why not him you know

426.3 --> 429.56
everybody knows it

434.22 --> 437.84000000000003
so yeah how are you guys doing

445.139 --> 448.94
hello slo-mo moon buggy

452.3 --> 455.41900000000004
all right

474.78 --> 478.979
I'm almost disappointed that I didn't

476.879 --> 481.74
get a comment

478.979 --> 485.52
about my

481.74 --> 488.16
about the panda conspiracy

485.52 --> 490.08
that was like an honest entry now of

488.16 --> 492.12
course should probably if I really want

490.08 --> 494.28
to get serious clip that and then send

492.12 --> 497.4
it over something

494.28 --> 499.08
but I thought that at least like crutch

497.4 --> 501.23999999999995
bear

499.08 --> 503.94
clutch bear

501.24 --> 505.44
would comment about it

503.94 --> 508.759
but oh well

505.44 --> 508.759
a seeking star water

517.979 --> 522.32
all of this blasting off into not outer

520.56 --> 525.8599999999999
space is a response to the Flat Earth

522.32 --> 528.4200000000001
well no I don't know

525.86 --> 531.54
indirectly Maybe

528.42 --> 535.6999999999999
it's also a response to

531.54 --> 539.5799999999999
building on and leaning heavily onto the

535.7 --> 542.6400000000001
futurist narrative right the promises

539.58 --> 545.519
are starting to weigh pretty heavy

542.64 --> 547.98
like okay where are our space stations

545.519 --> 551.04
where where is this

547.98 --> 554.76
commercial space travel and [ __ ]

551.04 --> 557.3389999999999
like where are the mining operations on

554.76 --> 558.8389999999999
other planets to enrich us right all

557.339 --> 560.8800000000001
these things

558.839 --> 562.98
they're starting to weigh more heavily

560.88 --> 565.4399999999999
on everybody and then noticing like yeah

562.98 --> 568.019
we give NASA and all these other groups

565.44 --> 571.0400000000001
all this money and we get to see some

568.019 --> 573.6
footage but in reality it's not really

571.04 --> 574.56
helping like we're not really getting

573.6 --> 576.66
there

574.56 --> 578.0999999999999
it's just more promises for in the

576.66 --> 581.9399999999999
future

578.1 --> 583.62
and people are getting a bit Restless

581.94 --> 586.9200000000001
with everything else in the world

583.62 --> 589.32
getting all pressured up and shitty

586.92 --> 591.24
so then they pressure more on the

589.32 --> 593.519
virtual world and now they want progress

591.24 --> 597.92
there right so it might be a response to

593.519 --> 597.92
that like that's why they're having this

599.399 --> 602.899
Carmen line race

606.48 --> 610.6800000000001
give a quick squirt so people can dream

609.42 --> 612.959
on

610.68 --> 614.88
and Overlook that they're never really

612.959 --> 617.88
gonna get anything that they're that

614.88 --> 620.3
they've been promised since the mid 20th

617.88 --> 620.3
century

620.94 --> 627.839
right

622.86 --> 630.019
hey Kristen good to see you Bad Karma

627.839 --> 630.019
foreign

648.72 --> 655.8000000000001
how do the glass windows handle loose

652.56 --> 658.3389999999999
beads what it what rocket Glimpse what

655.8 --> 658.3389999999999
are you talking about

679.98 --> 683.5790000000001
oh you didn't catch that one old horse

682.32 --> 685.1400000000001
Rod bound

683.579 --> 687.0
born

685.14 --> 690.06
yeah

687.0 --> 693.36
I even made a special link

690.06 --> 695.9399999999999
in the comment section to it to the the

693.36 --> 699.44
panda conspiracy entry

695.94 --> 699.44
was it two shows ago

700.079 --> 707.42
I think well no it was yesterday's show

703.44 --> 707.4200000000001
right let me double check

714.06 --> 717.56
yeah it was yesterday's show

717.6 --> 721.4590000000001
around uh the 40 minutes

721.5 --> 724.7
I put it all down

726.42 --> 730.3199999999999
like it was a proper conspiracy

728.639 --> 732.42
narrative like

730.32 --> 734.82
that was a narrative good enough for

732.42 --> 737.36
somebody to make crazy conspiracy video

734.82 --> 737.36
about it

742.68 --> 744.68
um

751.2 --> 756.98
right Bad Karma yeah yeah sure they'll

754.019 --> 756.98
offer flights

772.079 --> 775.519
it's a smart dude

779.459 --> 785.5189999999999
right well I don't even know like what

782.519 --> 788.1
they said about this thing about basis

785.519 --> 790.139
is like what he said about it

788.1 --> 792.72
what it's supposed to be standing for is

790.139 --> 794.4590000000001
this like the crown achievement of the

792.72 --> 797.0600000000001
whole thing or is this only the

794.459 --> 797.06
preliminary

798.06 --> 802.6199999999999
like a test flight with people it was

801.36 --> 805.019
the first flight where there were

802.62 --> 807.0
actually people on board as far as I

805.019 --> 810.42
heard

807.0 --> 812.399
but yeah does he actually plan to go

810.42 --> 816.06
beyond

812.399 --> 818.339
or not is this it is this just like oh

816.06 --> 823.26
look this is the ride and now people can

818.339 --> 825.9590000000001
get this ride too and that's it

823.26 --> 827.8199999999999
or is it supposed to be like an early

825.959 --> 830.9399999999999
project

827.82 --> 833.1600000000001
still in the development phase to move

830.94 --> 835.2600000000001
Beyond to wherever wherever he was

833.16 --> 837.4399999999999
planning to go Mars or the moon or

835.26 --> 837.4399999999999
something

844.519 --> 848.24
Venus Envy one

850.92 --> 856.139
going further okay well that's very

853.92 --> 858.24
unspecific right if he doesn't actually

856.139 --> 861.66
Target

858.24 --> 864.5
with a name like the Moon

861.66 --> 864.5
or

864.6 --> 871.62
like beyond the ISS

867.899 --> 874.5
High Earth orbit or Mars or something

871.62 --> 878.399
unless he actually mentions that then

874.5 --> 880.019
going further literally means nothing it

878.399 --> 883.82
just means like yeah we'll keep going

880.019 --> 883.82
that's it no promises

884.22 --> 889.94
further next yeah right so that

886.38 --> 889.9399999999999
literally means nothing okay

890.04 --> 892.3389999999999
foreign

898.279 --> 903.6
I remember that I I remember that

901.74 --> 906.24
article

903.6 --> 907.6800000000001
was talked about on the flashlights what

906.24 --> 910.279
is it a year ago

907.68 --> 910.279
uh

920.06 --> 927.2399999999999
a classical homeopath

923.94 --> 932.0600000000001
welcome back long time no see

927.24 --> 932.0600000000001
I'm just so Billy rigged is that

932.1 --> 938.1800000000001
like quote from Bezos

934.92 --> 938.18
classical homeopath

939.899 --> 948.44
yes Bad Karma I know that's what you did

942.899 --> 948.44
and then I gave you the response to it

949.199 --> 951.8599999999999
huh

953.1 --> 959.3000000000001
the rocket is the other rocket is for

956.699 --> 959.3
orbit

961.8 --> 966.18
few hours really

967.5 --> 973.62
okay Moon Shadow

970.019 --> 978.079
well that very curious to see that

973.62 --> 978.079
orbit for hours right

982.92 --> 987.199
very curious to see how he does that

992.279 --> 998.22
yeah own Benjamin did a speech and Flat

995.16 --> 1001.16
Earth yesterday yeah yeah I think

998.22 --> 1005.019
I did catch that part at the beginning

1001.16 --> 1005.019
of of the Stream

1006.019 --> 1008.98
yes he did

1041.9 --> 1045.5790000000002
what are you talking about

1045.62 --> 1050.1399999999999
old horse Rod born what

1055.28 --> 1059.08
yes Bad Karma

1059.419 --> 1064.7
that's right

1061.88 --> 1067.9
everybody knows that bezos's rocket

1064.7 --> 1067.9
looked like a penis

1068.179 --> 1073.3600000000001
that's not a secret it's blatantly

1070.94 --> 1073.3600000000001
obvious

1081.44 --> 1087.039
Moonshadow is a cat Steve oh okay okay

1083.78 --> 1087.039
sorry I didn't know that

1100.96 --> 1105.46
really low yeah what

1107.539 --> 1111.32
it's the issue here are you a robot or

1109.52 --> 1115.66
something

1111.32 --> 1115.6599999999999
hey Judo good to see you

1122.96 --> 1127.039
right yeah Bad Karma I already gave

1125.0 --> 1129.62
comment to that yesterday

1127.039 --> 1132.02
I think was pretty elaborate elaborate

1129.62 --> 1135.02
enough for me right

1132.02 --> 1138.46
process of describing

1135.02 --> 1138.46
what it basically is

1143.96 --> 1147.46
a green silo

1153.86 --> 1158.12
right yeah the whole point about karma

1156.08 --> 1162.26
is that it's not

1158.12 --> 1166.6599999999999
a successful procreation sex act in this

1162.26 --> 1166.66
symbol it's literally just jacking it

1167.179 --> 1172.94
like Conjuring a fantasy of

1169.94 --> 1172.94
heliocentrism

1176.72 --> 1183.5
and with a lot of spectacle just

1180.62 --> 1186.32
doing that and not getting anywhere but

1183.5 --> 1190.0
like oh let the fantasy of it stick it's

1186.32 --> 1190.0
like the metaphor

1190.78 --> 1194.6789999999999
is uncanny

1194.72 --> 1198.34
it yeah jacking it

1207.86 --> 1212.9599999999998
like it's space porn come on

1210.799 --> 1216.26
it's a giant dick

1212.96 --> 1218.0
and with a lot of noise all the cameras

1216.26 --> 1220.52
are on it

1218.0 --> 1223.159
as it goes up

1220.52 --> 1226.1
and install a lot of women talking about

1223.159 --> 1230.24
space and going to space and how amazing

1226.1 --> 1234.26
this is it's porn it's space porn you're

1230.24 --> 1238.159
literally staring at a giant dick

1234.26 --> 1240.3799999999999
while women are talking about space

1238.159 --> 1245.419
and how fantastic it all is and how

1240.38 --> 1248.24
precious and that's porn guys come on

1245.419 --> 1251.419
it's whacking it

1248.24 --> 1254.48
and then yeah Bezos even had a bit of

1251.419 --> 1257.659
trouble getting out so like the final

1254.48 --> 1260.26
squirt which is

1257.659 --> 1260.2600000000002
right

1260.72 --> 1266.659
the people coming out it took a little

1263.12 --> 1269.4189999999999
long so like more attention had to build

1266.659 --> 1271.1000000000001
off like let's just say Basil's had a

1269.419 --> 1273.0800000000002
bit of trouble coming

1271.1 --> 1274.039
that's why it took a little longer in

1273.08 --> 1278.299
the end

1274.039 --> 1281.24
like he had to have cameras on it

1278.299 --> 1283.22
everybody had to be there before he came

1281.24 --> 1286.059
out

1283.22 --> 1289.3600000000001
off the tip of the penis come on guys

1286.059 --> 1289.36
this is this

1289.88 --> 1292.7800000000002
ah

1293.27 --> 1296.3799999999999
[Music]

1317.96 --> 1325.72
the Ryan program admitted they'd never

1320.48 --> 1325.72
been to space what really naughty Tonto

1326.96 --> 1330.88
you got a source for that

1354.14 --> 1358.8200000000002
yeah but Matthew Hall look

1356.419 --> 1363.44
that it looks like a penis

1358.82 --> 1365.539
you know that's what Bezos wanted

1363.44 --> 1367.88
it's his design right it doesn't

1365.539 --> 1369.32
necessarily completely have to look like

1367.88 --> 1373.5200000000002
that

1369.32 --> 1377.1789999999999
but if it would look radically different

1373.52 --> 1378.2
then it would kind of like feel off feel

1377.179 --> 1380.7800000000002
off

1378.2 --> 1383.6000000000001
right there's the rocket they typically

1380.78 --> 1384.74
do become shaped like penises for some

1383.6 --> 1387.4399999999998
reason

1384.74 --> 1390.919
and then if it's radically different

1387.44 --> 1392.96
then it's just going to be more like a

1390.919 --> 1394.76
people are going to see it more like an

1392.96 --> 1398.419
airplane

1394.76 --> 1401.059
or spaceship airplane style thing that's

1398.419 --> 1403.5200000000002
then launching vertically

1401.059 --> 1408.6399999999999
right so yeah

1403.52 --> 1408.6399999999999
traditionally rockets look like penises

1410.12 --> 1414.6789999999999
like this has more to do with the with

1412.46 --> 1415.7
the mind of people and what they see in

1414.679 --> 1418.76
things

1415.7 --> 1420.44
rather than like oh they they on purpose

1418.76 --> 1423.3799999999999
completely made it look like a dick

1420.44 --> 1425.1200000000001
every time nah

1423.38 --> 1427.7
but they don't

1425.12 --> 1430.1
go out of their way to make it not look

1427.7 --> 1434.539
like a dick let's just say it like that

1430.1 --> 1437.84
right and yeah Bezos did absolutely

1434.539 --> 1440.24
make it look like a dick come on that's

1437.84 --> 1442.48
that's just a fact there's no escaping

1440.24 --> 1442.48
that

1444.26 --> 1448.7
right yeah Richard Branson's Virgin

1446.36 --> 1450.82
Galactic yeah that doesn't look like a

1448.7 --> 1450.82
dick

1451.7 --> 1454.419
at all

1457.159 --> 1459.7600000000002
right

1463.0 --> 1467.38
logical fallacy yeah yeah

1467.539 --> 1473.44
it's only a logical fallacy

1471.02 --> 1473.44
right

1495.34 --> 1500.84
okay that's a good point Tony Whitcomb I

1499.46 --> 1503.8400000000001
didn't know that

1500.84 --> 1507.82
yeah it probably wasn't designed very

1503.84 --> 1507.82
aerodynamic for Optimum speed

1523.539 --> 1529.22
uterus [ __ ] okay slow on moon buggy

1526.76 --> 1532.46
that's interesting

1529.22 --> 1538.039
you got a point there

1532.46 --> 1543.46
yeah yeah damn dude you're totally right

1538.039 --> 1543.46
it doesn't look like a uterus wow

1543.5 --> 1546.1
huh

1558.02 --> 1560.559
right

1567.08 --> 1574.539
don't know what to really make of that

1570.32 --> 1574.539
but yeah it it kind of does

1589.72 --> 1596.659
960 shows my mind is finally blown uh I

1594.44 --> 1599.8600000000001
don't know man my mind gets blown on a

1596.659 --> 1599.8600000000001
periodic basis

1604.279 --> 1609.44
I think that my mind is getting blown

1606.32 --> 1611.779
more and more periodically over time

1609.44 --> 1615.0800000000002
like it it's growing exponentially

1611.779 --> 1619.159
because the world is getting quite crazy

1615.08 --> 1621.08
and fractal line now it always was but

1619.159 --> 1626.48
simply the

1621.08 --> 1630.22
input of that is condensing it's

1626.48 --> 1630.22
getting more rapid

1630.32 --> 1632.86
right

1635.0 --> 1638.779
like they're more desperate for quick

1637.279 --> 1641.24
distraction

1638.779 --> 1643.94
and more powerful distraction because

1641.24 --> 1645.38
the whole thing is really all about to

1643.94 --> 1650.24
just

1645.38 --> 1653.179
collapse really badly in many ways

1650.24 --> 1656.6
so yeah the more disastrous the

1653.179 --> 1657.46
situation becomes the more desperate for

1656.6 --> 1661.2199999999998
a

1657.46 --> 1664.24
gripping distraction the system becomes

1661.22 --> 1664.24
it's only logical

1680.539 --> 1683.3799999999999
what what what

1702.02 --> 1707.12
God Bad Karma you're such a [ __ ] why do

1704.899 --> 1710.6
you keep defending this [ __ ]

1707.12 --> 1713.059
like why do you need to defend it

1710.6 --> 1716.3799999999999
I mean you apparently believe in the

1713.059 --> 1718.34
globe that's one thing but why are you

1716.38 --> 1720.14
invested

1718.34 --> 1723.08
in these

1720.14 --> 1725.539
silly rocket launches things come on

1723.08 --> 1728.559
serious like are they actually

1725.539 --> 1728.559
accomplishing anything

1733.34 --> 1738.74
like have their actions

1736.159 --> 1741.44
and flights helped you

1738.74 --> 1744.799
win an argument

1741.44 --> 1748.76
against Flat Earth at any point

1744.799 --> 1752.26
why are you so invested in this

1748.76 --> 1752.26
why are you defending it

1756.86 --> 1763.279
or or do you bad karma actually believe

1760.039 --> 1768.64
that they're going to deliver on the

1763.279 --> 1768.64
long-term Promises of space fare

1770.12 --> 1774.58
for the public do you really believe

1772.22 --> 1774.58
that

1781.22 --> 1786.88
I loved God

1783.98 --> 1786.88
that is

1799.1 --> 1805.6589999999999
missing in action r value yes that's

1802.039 --> 1805.6589999999999
correct Dusty Rider

1818.96 --> 1822.799
right yeah yes he can start with look

1821.059 --> 1825.02
when they say

1822.799 --> 1827.6589999999999
they can't go back to the Moon because

1825.02 --> 1830.4189999999999
it's they lost the technology and it's

1827.659 --> 1833.8990000000001
too painful to put it back together what

1830.419 --> 1835.5200000000002
they actually mean

1833.899 --> 1838.039
when they say that

1835.52 --> 1843.1399999999999
is

1838.039 --> 1847.76
yeah we could do it all over again but

1843.14 --> 1850.159
people wouldn't fall for it now

1847.76 --> 1851.48
right that's literally what he's saying

1850.159 --> 1856.5800000000002
like

1851.48 --> 1860.059
it's too painful to put it back together

1856.58 --> 1862.279
right why because if they put it back

1860.059 --> 1865.34
together then everybody would

1862.279 --> 1870.519
immediately see through it

1865.34 --> 1870.519
right that's what that means

1873.32 --> 1879.08
there is a truth in what he says it's

1876.44 --> 1882.8200000000002
just not in the way he

1879.08 --> 1882.82
on the surface presented it

1916.039 --> 1923.24
all right these flights

1919.82 --> 1924.799
commercial these flights what Siri why

1923.24 --> 1927.82
are you fascinated with it being

1924.799 --> 1931.94
commercial right commercial only mean

1927.82 --> 1935.6
means that it's going to be done and

1931.94 --> 1938.179
repeated for financial gain

1935.6 --> 1940.34
right that's what commercial flights

1938.179 --> 1942.159
stand for so

1940.34 --> 1946.399
when we're talking about commercial

1942.159 --> 1948.8600000000001
flights say in the airline companies

1946.399 --> 1952.1
what makes it commercial is that people

1948.86 --> 1954.3799999999999
can get somewhere else on the world very

1952.1 --> 1957.559
quickly

1954.38 --> 1959.179
and that'll save them a lot of money and

1957.559 --> 1960.5
opportunity

1959.179 --> 1963.3200000000002
right

1960.5 --> 1967.64
so they'll pay for that and then the

1963.32 --> 1970.279
airline company can also benefit

1967.64 --> 1972.2
from that profit and then it's a

1970.279 --> 1975.76
commercial airline see and then you got

1972.2 --> 1975.76
something go so how does

1975.799 --> 1980.779
this launching

1977.96 --> 1983.419
of rockets actually make a profit other

1980.779 --> 1985.76
than by its spectacle

1983.419 --> 1988.039
and people getting all riled up about it

1985.76 --> 1991.519
right

1988.039 --> 1993.799
There's no practical benefit to it as a

1991.519 --> 1996.679
technical application in the world it's

1993.799 --> 2000.34
just a big amusement ride

1996.679 --> 2002.8600000000001
so to call it commercial flights well

2000.34 --> 2006.519
yeah in its commercial flights in the

2002.86 --> 2008.86
sense that a roller coaster

2006.519 --> 2012.46
you know a spectacular roller coaster

2008.86 --> 2014.5
yeah you can buy a ticket to the park in

2012.46 --> 2016.779
which the roller coaster is and then you

2014.5 --> 2020.679
can partake in the roller coaster

2016.779 --> 2022.6
and then the park makes a profit

2020.679 --> 2024.8200000000002
and you got your experience in the

2022.6 --> 2026.1999999999998
roller coaster in that sense yeah

2024.82 --> 2028.72
commercial

2026.2 --> 2031.1200000000001
but other than that

2028.72 --> 2033.8990000000001
there's no

2031.12 --> 2033.899
practical

2034.36 --> 2042.1
commercial advantages coming out of this

2038.44 --> 2044.14
other than that right it's just an

2042.1 --> 2046.9189999999999
entertainment Park setup

2044.14 --> 2046.919
that's it

2051.98 --> 2055.11
[Music]

2055.48 --> 2059.46
that's right just the fairground right

2059.67 --> 2062.739
[Music]

2068.379 --> 2073.0789999999997
colonize Antarctic oh really yeah dude

2071.5 --> 2075.099
dude go

2073.079 --> 2078.659
Tom Tom

2075.099 --> 2078.659
I'd like to see you try

2084.46 --> 2087.2400000000002
I mean

2088.419 --> 2093.359
it's only a giant Frozen ice skate

2094.24 --> 2100.1189999999997
who wouldn't want to live there this is

2097.119 --> 2100.119
uh

2103.839 --> 2111.119
okay Bad Karma I'm glad you're able to

2106.599 --> 2111.119
admit that that's at least something

2130.66 --> 2137.2599999999998
right so yeah Moon Shadow I find it kind

2134.26 --> 2140.7400000000002
of and Dusty Rider no wait well Bad

2137.26 --> 2143.98
Karma I find it kind of bizarre

2140.74 --> 2146.9199999999996
that on one hand

2143.98 --> 2148.839
the world especially the Western world

2146.92 --> 2152.02
is getting

2148.839 --> 2155.38
basically taxed

2152.02 --> 2157.66
and manipulated through climate change

2155.38 --> 2160.42
propaganda

2157.66 --> 2162.52
because of the output and there's the

2160.42 --> 2165.52
supposed danger that causes to The

2162.52 --> 2167.859
Climate right but at the same time

2165.52 --> 2170.02
these rich

2167.859 --> 2172.0
dicks

2170.02 --> 2174.94
can just

2172.0 --> 2178.5
will literally burn up giant Rockets

2174.94 --> 2182.619
right I bet they're not gonna be very

2178.5 --> 2185.44
fuel efficient if you know what I mean

2182.619 --> 2187.7200000000003
like it's basically a just a giant

2185.44 --> 2190.66
amount of

2187.72 --> 2193.74
stuff being burned up right

2190.66 --> 2193.74
so that's okay

2195.28 --> 2200.6800000000003
or I don't know man do they get climate

2197.859 --> 2202.7799999999997
taxation on those types of things

2200.68 --> 2204.64
I know NASA wouldn't because they're

2202.78 --> 2205.8390000000004
just government

2204.64 --> 2208.72
think

2205.839 --> 2211.48
so it's all built like they get just

2208.72 --> 2213.0989999999997
money from the government anyway it

2211.48 --> 2215.7
doesn't really matter you don't need to

2213.099 --> 2215.7000000000003
tax that

2216.04 --> 2222.7
but do these these commercial uh private

2220.18 --> 2226.4199999999996
Enterprise rocket launches do they play

2222.7 --> 2229.4199999999996
pay climate taxes on that or if it's in

2226.42 --> 2233.46
the United States probably not

2229.42 --> 2233.46
it's just all ridiculous

2233.68 --> 2239.44
right they get the joyride wasting giant

2236.56 --> 2241.96
amount of fuel it's like okay we all

2239.44 --> 2246.64
have to stop

2241.96 --> 2249.7
stop using Fuel and all go to durable

2246.64 --> 2253.359
resources blah blah blah but a bunch of

2249.7 --> 2256.4199999999996
crazy billionaires could metaphorically

2253.359 --> 2259.54
just set some oil field on fire because

2256.42 --> 2262.3
they really wanted to see a big fire

2259.54 --> 2263.92
yay

2262.3 --> 2268.5
right

2263.92 --> 2268.5
that's kind of what it feels like to me

2270.28 --> 2278.079
as comparable to oh we have to save the

2273.82 --> 2280.96
wildlife and rare species and then yeah

2278.079 --> 2285.099
the the rain movement and

2280.96 --> 2288.46
all these funds but yet certain super

2285.099 --> 2292.119
Elites and nobility people just go out

2288.46 --> 2294.52
and just hunt endangered species for

2292.119 --> 2297.76
sport and proudly take photographs with

2294.52 --> 2301.599
it in that right it's in the same level

2297.76 --> 2306.28
I feel that's very similar

2301.599 --> 2309.7000000000003
it's like yeah no no no you people the

2306.28 --> 2313.48
cattle you can't do anything we can do

2309.7 --> 2316.2999999999997
whatever we want even if it is grossly

2313.48 --> 2319.0
in opposition to everything we've

2316.3 --> 2320.8590000000004
constantly indoctrinated you with

2319.0 --> 2324.579
right

2320.859 --> 2327.52
now the indoctrination the tightness

2324.579 --> 2329.38
the suffering for Humanity and for the

2327.52 --> 2333.7
Earth that's for you

2329.38 --> 2337.359
cattle that's not for us billionaires we

2333.7 --> 2340.359
can just blatantly violate

2337.359 --> 2344.04
any of these rules that we impose upon

2340.359 --> 2347.619
you at a whim and flaunt it in your face

2344.04 --> 2350.22
welcome to Neo feudalism

2347.619 --> 2350.2200000000003
right

2354.339 --> 2356.94
okay

2381.88 --> 2385.079
what the hell

2398.56 --> 2403.839
what are you talking about Moon Shadow

2400.92 --> 2406.599
they are not fuel efficient hydrogen

2403.839 --> 2408.52
plus oxygen

2406.599 --> 2411.52
are you saying

2408.52 --> 2414.119
that the rocket went on hydrogen and

2411.52 --> 2414.119
oxygen

2415.66 --> 2420.24
is that what you're saying

2418.18 --> 2423.839
that's

2420.24 --> 2423.839
extremely dangerous

2425.319 --> 2430.24
like even if you have separated text

2427.48 --> 2432.839
that is

2430.24 --> 2432.839
like

2436.78 --> 2442.8590000000004
really dangerous but okay apparently

2439.96 --> 2445.9
they managed to get that

2442.859 --> 2448.2999999999997
engineered out in a way that it is

2445.9 --> 2451.02
safe enough that that is pretty

2448.3 --> 2451.02
spectacular

2452.44 --> 2457.44
if that is what you were talking about

2454.72 --> 2457.4399999999996
at all

2458.14 --> 2461.46
it's not like I can tell

2495.7 --> 2501.52
you're all just talking to George

2497.92 --> 2506.16
Sanford for some reason all right

2501.52 --> 2506.16
fine don't talk

2519.76 --> 2524.46
liquid oxygen and hydrogen okay

2526.599 --> 2532.48
right well yeah

2529.96 --> 2536.46
if you combine that

2532.48 --> 2536.46
like if you mix it up

2538.9 --> 2545.56
and then ignite it that is

2542.16 --> 2548.3799999999997
extremely explosive and I mean extremely

2545.56 --> 2552.7599999999998
it is detonation level explosive it is

2548.38 --> 2556.06
dynamite level explosive

2552.76 --> 2559.6600000000003
it's probably the most explosive

2556.06 --> 2562.72
combination of materials possible

2559.66 --> 2564.7599999999998
is oxygen and hydrogen in gaseous form

2562.72 --> 2566.2599999999998
being ignited

2564.76 --> 2570.099
right

2566.26 --> 2572.2000000000003
so if he actually has a system where it

2570.099 --> 2574.3590000000004
managed to combine

2572.2 --> 2576.339
safely

2574.359 --> 2580.66
that's spectacular

2576.339 --> 2583.06
but yeah one little little thingy going

2580.66 --> 2584.7999999999997
wrong and it's bad

2583.06 --> 2588.54
and I'm not talking about a giant

2584.8 --> 2588.54
Fireball I'm talking about like

2589.359 --> 2597.0989999999997
like really absolutely shattering apart

2593.579 --> 2600.6400000000003
like part little bits

2597.099 --> 2603.579
of the whole thing shattering and just

2600.64 --> 2605.0789999999997
exploding in all directions like a big

2603.579 --> 2608.8590000000004
fireworks

2605.079 --> 2612.9
like holy [ __ ] would that explode right

2608.859 --> 2612.9
so if they manage to use that

2615.46 --> 2621.64
in a safe way that's pretty spectacular

2617.98 --> 2625.56
feat of engineering I'd say or extremely

2621.64 --> 2625.56
risky I don't know

2631.48 --> 2634.14
ah

2660.28 --> 2666.48
well Daffy Duck

2662.74 --> 2666.4799999999996
like who comes up with these names

2667.06 --> 2672.46
and crowdfund to go into space well how

2670.18 --> 2674.9199999999996
about I do my own exploration project

2672.46 --> 2677.14
right I've already said I'm very

2674.92 --> 2680.92
interested to see

2677.14 --> 2685.7799999999997
if he gets could get something to stick

2680.92 --> 2688.96
to the top or to the firmament

2685.78 --> 2692.3190000000004
the top of the container in some way

2688.96 --> 2694.06
to have a rocket not a manned rocket

2692.319 --> 2696.7599999999998
thanks

2694.06 --> 2700.18
go up there and basically

2696.76 --> 2702.94
have a nose of a giant paint bomb

2700.18 --> 2705.7599999999998
to make it hit the firmament

2702.94 --> 2709.9
or however high up and it would really

2705.76 --> 2712.9
have to be like a a missile like yeah

2709.9 --> 2715.359
not for manned

2712.9 --> 2718.14
to just go up there and then splatter

2715.359 --> 2718.14
paint

2720.52 --> 2726.46
and then to see like okay does it stick

2723.64 --> 2729.339
when the thing falls back down when the

2726.46 --> 2731.98
rocket falls back down cameras in all

2729.339 --> 2734.7599999999998
directions see if like as it falls down

2731.98 --> 2737.38
you can still see the pain stain

2734.76 --> 2740.0400000000004
persistent like not just droplets of

2737.38 --> 2743.319
paint going in all directions

2740.04 --> 2745.0
diffusing to the camera but an actual

2743.319 --> 2748.359
stained blotch

2745.0 --> 2750.099
that's just visible like that would be

2748.359 --> 2754.02
interesting

2750.099 --> 2754.02
thought of that like three years ago

2768.22 --> 2774.8999999999996
right but I'm I'm not interested in

2770.5 --> 2774.9
going into a manned flight

2774.94 --> 2777.839
up there

2779.8 --> 2785.5600000000004
I'd be more interested to

2782.26 --> 2789.1600000000003
to try out Airship technology

2785.56 --> 2792.04
to like get really advanced

2789.16 --> 2795.7799999999997
Zeppelin technology for example to just

2792.04 --> 2795.7799999999997
float really high up

2796.18 --> 2798.5989999999997
right

2799.24 --> 2806.14
to see what that's like

2802.18 --> 2809.859
I don't know I'd love to like Cruise in

2806.14 --> 2813.2799999999997
a giant Zeppelin and just look at the

2809.859 --> 2814.48
the tapestry of clouds far far beneath

2813.28 --> 2818.7400000000002
you

2814.48 --> 2820.3
and stare at the odd looking sun it's

2818.74 --> 2821.68
probably gonna look pretty weird up

2820.3 --> 2823.48
there

2821.68 --> 2826.0789999999997
that would be a very interesting

2823.48 --> 2826.079
experience

2827.74 --> 2832.66
and I'm not really interested in in

2829.599 --> 2834.6400000000003
going on some kind of a Rocket Ride

2832.66 --> 2836.74
you know I'll I'll just take the roller

2834.64 --> 2839.339
coaster that's good enough for me and a

2836.74 --> 2839.339
lot safer

2854.74 --> 2857.4599999999996
all right

2862.98 --> 2869.92
YOLO yeah I do that's right you only

2867.94 --> 2873.16
live once

2869.92 --> 2877.059
and I'd like to not waste

2873.16 --> 2878.74
that life on stupid [ __ ] and needless

2877.059 --> 2881.02
risks

2878.74 --> 2883.859
that don't lead to anything

2881.02 --> 2883.859
that's right

2945.7 --> 2951.359
well advertiserable what the hell are

2948.64 --> 2951.359
you talking about

2988.24 --> 2993.0
dude you're just a guy in chat

2993.94 --> 3000.18
maybe you should stop the uh

2997.78 --> 3003.5400000000004
the megalomaniacal squirting there

3000.18 --> 3006.14
you're you're a guy in chat

3003.54 --> 3006.14
okay

3008.64 --> 3013.4
you are not the faces of God thanks

3016.5 --> 3021.359
and if you actually expect me to believe

3018.66 --> 3024.18
that then I'll ban you because I'm not

3021.359 --> 3028.16
going to say that name constantly if

3024.18 --> 3028.16
it's that serious yeah

3028.74 --> 3032.359
good stop it

3047.27 --> 3050.36
[Music]

3051.18 --> 3058.04
what does the globe model say about

3053.66 --> 3058.04
coriolis in large bodies of water

3059.22 --> 3062.0
uh

3064.68 --> 3071.0989999999997
I don't know I think that the supposed

3068.119 --> 3073.98
coriolis influences according to the

3071.099 --> 3076.559
globe model like hurricanes that it

3073.98 --> 3078.78
might have some influence on the oceanic

3076.559 --> 3080.8190000000004
currents or something right

3078.78 --> 3083.3390000000004
they'd like to just

3080.819 --> 3086.2799999999997
typically pull in those types of things

3083.339 --> 3088.5
so if the Coriolis effect of the Earth

3086.28 --> 3089.78
spinning underneath supposedly causes

3088.5 --> 3092.76
hurricanes

3089.78 --> 3094.5
and Twirls in your toilet in One

3092.76 --> 3097.98
Direction and the other

3094.5 --> 3099.54
then it might also cause currents to go

3097.98 --> 3101.88
in the way they do

3099.54 --> 3104.4
I don't know if that's if that's part of

3101.88 --> 3107.839
their claim but

3104.4 --> 3107.839
I wouldn't be surprised

3111.059 --> 3115.7000000000003
yeah okay I'm just gonna time you out

3113.339 --> 3115.7
now

3116.28 --> 3121.2000000000003
so let me stop you for you because you

3119.46 --> 3123.7400000000002
don't seem to be very successful at

3121.2 --> 3123.74
stopping

3138.059 --> 3143.1800000000003
yeah well Bad Karma I was mostly talking

3140.4 --> 3143.1800000000003
about you

3144.079 --> 3149.46
has his own issues I've already taken

3146.88 --> 3151.26
note of that for some time he likes he

3149.46 --> 3153.66
tends to get carried away with things

3151.26 --> 3157.8
right

3153.66 --> 3160.859
that's not the same as your situation

3157.8 --> 3163.2000000000003
where you basically claim that you just

3160.859 --> 3166.619
literally make your own reality because

3163.2 --> 3169.0989999999997
you will it right that's worse that's a

3166.619 --> 3169.099
lot worse

3194.72 --> 3199.9399999999996
the same applies no no it doesn't

3201.0 --> 3206.579
no he just gets into stuff

3204.54 --> 3208.44
that he's read about that he's put

3206.579 --> 3213.9
together and then he gets a little

3208.44 --> 3217.619
obsessive that's not the same as oh

3213.9 --> 3220.98
I'm not gonna take things from out there

3217.619 --> 3223.859
no I'm gonna just literally create

3220.98 --> 3226.619
reality with my mind yeah that's what

3223.859 --> 3228.359
you were actually suggesting

3226.619 --> 3231.839
that's worse

3228.359 --> 3233.52
because all our Taza does is take things

3231.839 --> 3235.859
from out there

3233.52 --> 3238.859
and then get a little over preoccupied

3235.859 --> 3242.16
with them yeah

3238.859 --> 3245.0989999999997
over reflecting you could call it

3242.16 --> 3247.3799999999997
you're in full solipsistic mode where

3245.099 --> 3250.6800000000003
you are actually convinced that you can

3247.38 --> 3254.1600000000003
create or alter the fabric of reality

3250.68 --> 3257.2999999999997
ground up just because you will it yeah

3254.16 --> 3257.2999999999997
that's a lot worse

3261.3 --> 3265.94
yeah so stop projecting mad Karma

3266.28 --> 3268.46
foreign

3316.16 --> 3322.04
that's right lumpy gas in a vacuum

3318.78 --> 3322.0400000000004
that's exactly what it is

3322.26 --> 3326.2990000000004
you're absolutely On Target

3340.799 --> 3345.799
oh man well that's not what you said

3343.38 --> 3345.799
yesterday

3367.859 --> 3372.38
you think there's a psychiatric term for

3370.26 --> 3372.38
that

3373.38 --> 3377.6400000000003
I bet there is multiple

3377.76 --> 3381.7990000000004
a gaining wisdom good morning

3401.28 --> 3409.38
yeah yeah well look man Karma we know

3405.96 --> 3412.26
you can imagine anything to be real

3409.38 --> 3415.2000000000003
by your own design there's this thing

3412.26 --> 3417.2990000000004
though about it that doesn't make it

3415.2 --> 3419.16
real right that's not the same thing as

3417.299 --> 3422.099
you claimed yesterday you said you

3419.16 --> 3423.359
actually manifest reality through your

3422.099 --> 3426.42
will

3423.359 --> 3429.66
and then in that moment where you

3426.42 --> 3431.46
revealed that that's when I told you

3429.66 --> 3436.2
no

3431.46 --> 3439.4
it's actually a combination with action

3436.2 --> 3442.5
that manifest your will

3439.4 --> 3444.7400000000002
just thinking something doesn't make it

3442.5 --> 3444.74
real

3446.099 --> 3453.619
that's not how that effect work

3449.4 --> 3453.619
s right that's not how it works

3456.119 --> 3459.299
and you would never claim something well

3457.68 --> 3460.68
why didn't you watch yesterday's show

3459.299 --> 3464.099
back yeah

3460.68 --> 3467.5989999999997
it's right there yeah you did

3464.099 --> 3467.599
you doubled down on it

3495.42 --> 3497.96
hmm

3521.28 --> 3524.28
foreign

3545.64 --> 3551.5789999999997
wait what

3548.339 --> 3554.5789999999997
they speak it and write it before it's

3551.579 --> 3557.2400000000002
implemented by who

3554.579 --> 3557.2400000000002
what

3558.9 --> 3562.339
what are you saying getting wisdom

3587.28 --> 3593.2200000000003
yeah that Karma we know you can be as

3590.76 --> 3596.3590000000004
delusional as you allow yourself to

3593.22 --> 3596.359
become we know

3620.7 --> 3622.819
thank you

3653.4 --> 3660.54
right yeah the whole thing is about the

3656.94 --> 3662.579
my and why it's pretty easy to believe

3660.54 --> 3664.98
whatever you like

3662.579 --> 3666.3590000000004
is because it's actually a defense

3664.98 --> 3668.76
mechanism

3666.359 --> 3671.4
you see when you're in real world

3668.76 --> 3674.2200000000003
confronted with things that are too

3671.4 --> 3676.319
punishing to you not just to your ideas

3674.22 --> 3678.48
but just like it makes it very

3676.319 --> 3680.2799999999997
unpleasant like if reality is very

3678.48 --> 3683.88
demoralizing

3680.28 --> 3685.799
then having a fantasy to hold on to

3683.88 --> 3690.26
could literally mean the difference

3685.799 --> 3690.2599999999998
between being constantly sick

3690.68 --> 3696.24
and doing okay

3693.18 --> 3699.8999999999996
yeah it's a defense mechanism

3696.24 --> 3702.66
but if you get addicted to it just like

3699.9 --> 3705.359
you could get addicted to drugs that

3702.66 --> 3707.3999999999996
using it once in a very specific

3705.359 --> 3710.4
scenario to accomplish something very

3707.4 --> 3712.38
specific could be seen as a medicine

3710.4 --> 3714.1800000000003
if you then get addicted to it just like

3712.38 --> 3719.059
you could with drugs then you become

3714.18 --> 3719.0589999999997
dependent on it and then suddenly there

3720.359 --> 3728.0389999999998
then you can't step away

3723.48 --> 3729.66
from the fantasy even if you no longer

3728.039 --> 3732.6600000000003
need it

3729.66 --> 3735.0
to survive because demoralizing

3732.66 --> 3738.299
situation out there in the real world

3735.0 --> 3741.299
have stopped or like enough time has

3738.299 --> 3743.7
passed so that it's no longer that tense

3741.299 --> 3746.839
right

3743.7 --> 3746.839
and then you got a problem

3749.339 --> 3755.96
so as I explained yesterday

3752.16 --> 3755.96
thinking is not free

3756.72 --> 3762.5989999999997
to think that you can just think

3759.42 --> 3764.76
whatever you like

3762.599 --> 3766.619
without a price

3764.76 --> 3769.1400000000003
is wrong

3766.619 --> 3772.38
it's not how things work there's always

3769.14 --> 3775.319
a price even a thought

3772.38 --> 3777.539
and if you use delusion

3775.319 --> 3780.24
to get around

3777.539 --> 3783.26
and then you lose track of that it's

3780.24 --> 3786.7799999999997
actually an illusion that you use to

3783.26 --> 3790.1400000000003
encourage yourself like remembering

3786.78 --> 3792.2400000000002
a very encouraging speech by your

3790.14 --> 3794.8799999999997
personal speech by your mother or your

3792.24 --> 3796.859
dad or something or brother at one point

3794.88 --> 3798.7200000000003
in your life just remembering that can

3796.859 --> 3801.24
be very encouraging right now if you

3798.72 --> 3803.4599999999996
just have ideas or dreams

3801.24 --> 3806.9399999999996
and you hold on to them

3803.46 --> 3809.64
to grow through a tough time

3806.94 --> 3811.619
but you still kind of break apart then

3809.64 --> 3813.299
you might lose track that it is actually

3811.619 --> 3816.38
a dream and that's when it starts to

3813.299 --> 3816.38
become a psychosis

3817.14 --> 3823.5589999999997
right that's what happens when people

3819.539 --> 3826.3190000000004
snap then the dreams they hold on to

3823.559 --> 3828.3590000000004
they suddenly lose track of what's real

3826.319 --> 3831.42
and what isn't

3828.359 --> 3834.119
they lose the grip

3831.42 --> 3835.38
and then it all gets mixed up then they

3834.119 --> 3838.26
don't know the difference anymore

3835.38 --> 3842.0
between dreams and between knowledge of

3838.26 --> 3842.0
reality and then they got a problem

3842.16 --> 3848.0389999999998
and that's technically psychosis

3846.119 --> 3850.94
it happens under extreme pressure

3848.039 --> 3850.94
typically

3852.319 --> 3856.619
psychological pressure stress

3886.92 --> 3894.96
all right so my tactical advice when it

3890.7 --> 3897.72
comes to using dreams and Fantasies to

3894.96 --> 3900.42
get through tough times in your life

3897.72 --> 3903.18
is to realize very clearly when you do

3900.42 --> 3906.5
it that you do it

3903.18 --> 3909.8999999999996
enjoy it but don't

3906.5 --> 3912.359
truly sever

3909.9 --> 3914.52
the realization of what's actually going

3912.359 --> 3918.119
on just put it very far in the back of

3914.52 --> 3920.64
your mind don't lose it though

3918.119 --> 3923.88
enjoy the dream and then as soon as the

3920.64 --> 3927.0589999999997
stress devil levels go down Let It Go

3923.88 --> 3929.819
and pick it back up pick back up the

3927.059 --> 3933.0
reality as quick as possible

3929.819 --> 3936.0
because you might get addicted

3933.0 --> 3938.339
for second best for the Emergency

3936.0 --> 3941.28
mechanism

3938.339 --> 3943.02
to believe in a dream

3941.28 --> 3944.76
if you get addicted to that you

3943.02 --> 3947.28
literally get into trouble and that's

3944.76 --> 3950.099
when trauma in your life will

3947.28 --> 3952.559
effectively cause you to

3950.099 --> 3953.819
completely go astray and never find your

3952.559 --> 3957.3590000000004
way back

3953.819 --> 3961.579
it is always because of mechanisms of

3957.359 --> 3961.5789999999997
survival that includes dreaming

3962.94 --> 3969.66
they take hold of you and then you can't

3966.2 --> 3972.839
or you refuse to let go

3969.66 --> 3976.319
and then everything goes astray

3972.839 --> 3976.319
right because

3976.38 --> 3979.6400000000003
your imagination

3980.4 --> 3985.1600000000003
who you think is God in your imagination

3987.119 --> 3990.2000000000003
it's Satan

3990.359 --> 3996.42
because your imagination is literally a

3993.9 --> 3999.42
lie provider

3996.42 --> 4001.2200000000003
to help you escape from reality so in

3999.42 --> 4003.319
your imagination yeah it has a function

4001.22 --> 4004.52
it has a survival function

4003.319 --> 4008.72
right

4004.52 --> 4013.579
but what is mechanically transpiring

4008.72 --> 4017.48
is illusion is in deviation from reality

4013.579 --> 4020.059
when that happens it's a lie your

4017.48 --> 4023.42
imagination

4020.059 --> 4026.26
if you let it take grip of you then

4023.42 --> 4031.48
Satan takes grip of you

4026.26 --> 4031.48
through the fabric of reality

4032.78 --> 4037.579
Satan is lies

4034.88 --> 4042.1600000000003
God is the truth and God can be very

4037.579 --> 4042.1600000000003
punishing and Satan can be very

4044.319 --> 4047.66
consoling

4045.98 --> 4051.92
right

4047.66 --> 4057.68
but if you don't step out of the victim

4051.92 --> 4062.119
angle of doing things then sadly Satan

4057.68 --> 4067.0589999999997
takes a fuller much broader grip on you

4062.119 --> 4067.059
and then he actually does damage right

4068.66 --> 4073.5789999999997
so you got to be very careful with your

4071.18 --> 4076.0989999999997
imagination with your thoughts with the

4073.579 --> 4078.6800000000003
virtual Realm inside of your mind

4076.099 --> 4082.2400000000002
because that is technically

4078.68 --> 4082.24
in an esoteric sense

4082.94 --> 4087.319
the realm of Satan

4085.22 --> 4088.819
like

4087.319 --> 4092.0589999999997
God

4088.819 --> 4095.72
his realm is the physical reality

4092.059 --> 4098.6
because it works the way it was designed

4095.72 --> 4100.04
in your mind you can do whatever you

4098.6 --> 4102.5
want

4100.04 --> 4104.48
technically it's a possibility for you

4102.5 --> 4107.239
to do that but not without consequences

4104.48 --> 4109.3589999999995
right you can lie

4107.239 --> 4114.08
whenever you lie

4109.359 --> 4117.02
Satan slips in because Satan is lies he

4114.08 --> 4122.0199999999995
is the force of Lies he is the mechanism

4117.02 --> 4122.02
that rolls forth from that tactic

4123.319 --> 4127.159000000001
and everything that comes with it all

4125.179 --> 4130.1
the pollution all the damage

4127.159 --> 4133.339
all the erasing

4130.1 --> 4135.02
of grip on The Wider reality

4133.339 --> 4138.679
it's all satan

4135.02 --> 4141.14
he is lies and in your imagination is

4138.679 --> 4143.839
usually where he reaches out to you and

4141.14 --> 4146.659000000001
then takes from you

4143.839 --> 4149.42
reality

4146.659 --> 4151.639999999999
it's very difficult

4149.42 --> 4154.9400000000005
especially again when you're under very

4151.64 --> 4156.259
high pressure which luckily Me In This

4154.94 --> 4158.0599999999995
Moment

4156.259 --> 4161.359
I am not

4158.06 --> 4162.679
but God five years ago

4161.359 --> 4165.9800000000005
yeah

4162.679 --> 4168.679
and then I can even

4165.98 --> 4170.7789999999995
example the mechanism like I was under

4168.679 --> 4173.96
so much pressure I felt so bad about

4170.779 --> 4177.259
myself I felt so filled I felt I failed

4173.96 --> 4181.339
in life I felt I failed in my mission

4177.259 --> 4184.94
I felt I failed in everything so super

4181.339 --> 4187.88
punishment super punishment

4184.94 --> 4190.4
and I literally hallucinated from that

4187.88 --> 4193.179
literally it's like my imagination

4190.4 --> 4194.839999999999
spawned forth

4193.179 --> 4197.719
distractions

4194.84 --> 4200.719
for me to in the moment latch onto

4197.719 --> 4204.679
because the the constant feel of

4200.719 --> 4207.38
punishment was so severe

4204.679 --> 4209.42
that it would just manifest as a defense

4207.38 --> 4212.54
mechanism right even hallucinations

4209.42 --> 4216.1
could be considered technically as a

4212.54 --> 4218.6
defense mechanism to escape from extreme

4216.1 --> 4221.3
punishing experience

4218.6 --> 4223.34
now of course where it leads to can even

4221.3 --> 4225.08
be more punishing especially if you get

4223.34 --> 4227.360000000001
obsessed over it or you try to real

4225.08 --> 4229.4
fight into reality but that's part of

4227.36 --> 4231.94
the distracting act right because

4229.4 --> 4234.739
distraction

4231.94 --> 4235.879999999999
moves you away from the sensation of

4234.739 --> 4238.419999999999
punishment

4235.88 --> 4238.42
right

4251.179 --> 4257.179
we punish ourselves

4254.54 --> 4259.4
doesn't really matter when it happens

4257.179 --> 4262.04
when it happens it happens for whatever

4259.4 --> 4267.219
reason you know realization

4262.04 --> 4267.219
when you let an illusion go

4267.32 --> 4271.639999999999
then you face a lot of punishment from

4270.56 --> 4274.400000000001
reality

4271.64 --> 4276.320000000001
and that can be so punishing that you

4274.4 --> 4279.5199999999995
could literally hallucinate from it and

4276.32 --> 4279.5199999999995
that's what I've experienced

4280.82 --> 4285.5
five years ago

4283.219 --> 4286.219
and that was before I got into Flat

4285.5 --> 4288.14
Earth

4286.219 --> 4291.44
what was it before or was it kind of

4288.14 --> 4292.9400000000005
doing no I think it was no it was right

4291.44 --> 4295.339999999999
before

4292.94 --> 4297.199
or somewhere in between it wasn't yeah

4295.34 --> 4298.400000000001
it was before the early bird show at

4297.199 --> 4300.199
least

4298.4 --> 4302.92
because I have talked about those

4300.199 --> 4302.919999999999
experiences

4305.659 --> 4310.28
but yeah I'm these days I'm in a

4308.48 --> 4313.459999999999
completely different position and much

4310.28 --> 4315.639999999999
more stabilized they feel much more at

4313.46 --> 4315.64
home

4315.8 --> 4321.8
that's an important sensation

4318.38 --> 4322.9400000000005
right the feeling that you this is your

4321.8 --> 4324.7390000000005
place

4322.94 --> 4327.32
like it doesn't matter what's on paper

4324.739 --> 4329.299999999999
like this is my place this is where I am

4327.32 --> 4331.88
this is where I have my influence and

4329.3 --> 4334.6990000000005
it's palpable

4331.88 --> 4337.04
it's palpable that I am here and so this

4334.699 --> 4339.32
is my home

4337.04 --> 4341.78
and The Sensation of home is all about

4339.32 --> 4343.82
stability

4341.78 --> 4346.58
and yeah five years ago I didn't have

4343.82 --> 4348.86
that I got kicked out of

4346.58 --> 4351.38
my girlfriend's house and I couldn't

4348.86 --> 4353.239
accept that and I couldn't accept that

4351.38 --> 4355.46
she broke up and it couldn't accept

4353.239 --> 4358.879999999999
anything and it felt like everything I

4355.46 --> 4362.0
dreamed about is all destroyed I had so

4358.88 --> 4364.58
many plans so many I had set forth a

4362.0 --> 4366.62
life in my head ahead for like the rest

4364.58 --> 4368.42
of my life I already planned it out

4366.62 --> 4370.5199999999995
pretty much roughly

4368.42 --> 4371.659
very seriously right and then it's all

4370.52 --> 4374.0
destroyed

4371.659 --> 4376.239
and his only punishment left when that

4374.0 --> 4376.239
happens

4379.219 --> 4383.9800000000005
but that's all done it's in the past now

4384.199 --> 4388.759999999999
I am moving on

4386.9 --> 4393.58
but it's

4388.76 --> 4393.58
yeah it has left its scars

4401.84 --> 4407.96
and there's obstacles that I am starting

4405.38 --> 4409.28
to become uncertain if I will ever

4407.96 --> 4412.28
overcome them

4409.28 --> 4415.099999999999
like this sounds a bit weird but like

4412.28 --> 4416.9
could I ever trust a woman again in a

4415.1 --> 4419.5
relationship

4416.9 --> 4419.5
really

4419.719 --> 4424.52
like do I even want to risk that that

4422.48 --> 4429.94
and that sounds really bizarre right

4424.52 --> 4429.9400000000005
because I freaking love women in general

4431.36 --> 4434.96
but yeah the things how they enrolled

4433.88 --> 4438.56
back then

4434.96 --> 4443.5
I threw I had all my trust I invested

4438.56 --> 4443.5
every bit of trust I had in this girl

4445.659 --> 4454.78
and she violated that trust in more ways

4451.159 --> 4454.78
than I could figure out

4455.54 --> 4462.28
like she probably did [ __ ] that I I did

4458.36 --> 4462.28
I just ignored it

4463.76 --> 4467.3
foreign

4465.5 --> 4469.699
because I was getting obsessed with her

4467.3 --> 4472.52
right it was like

4469.699 --> 4476.5
never mind anyway it's all in the past I

4472.52 --> 4476.5
I'm I'm over that [ __ ]

4480.5 --> 4486.92
but I still experience hesitancy to

4483.679 --> 4490.88
engage I'm like no I'll just get to know

4486.92 --> 4493.9400000000005
a girl for 10 years straight before I

4490.88 --> 4496.28
engage in asking a date right that's

4493.94 --> 4498.98
kind of my sensation right now

4496.28 --> 4503.36
and I'm actually enjoying not having a

4498.98 --> 4506.178999999999
relationship and being able to enjoy

4503.36 --> 4508.699
women on a distance

4506.179 --> 4510.92
in a non-sexual way but just like

4508.699 --> 4514.099999999999
feeling their energy and just like being

4510.92 --> 4517.159
nice to them right and maybe they'll

4514.1 --> 4519.679
have some curiosity and I want to keep

4517.159 --> 4523.54
it that way I want to keep it I don't

4519.679 --> 4523.54
want a freaking relationship anymore

4523.699 --> 4530.36
but yeah if I ever want to get kids

4527.239 --> 4531.98
then I will have to but it as I've

4530.36 --> 4533.179
already said it's got to be really

4531.98 --> 4536.239
special

4533.179 --> 4539.0
and that almost seems unreasonable

4536.239 --> 4542.599999999999
and I know that and that's why I don't

4539.0 --> 4546.679
feel like I have a guarantee

4542.6 --> 4548.96
I'm just gonna have to leave it to God

4546.679 --> 4551.6
and keep doing what I do and improving

4548.96 --> 4554.5
and doing it better and then

4551.6 --> 4554.5
at some point

4555.98 --> 4562.218999999999
I will bump into her

4558.62 --> 4566.199
whoever she is or the moment will arrive

4562.219 --> 4566.199
with somebody already knew

4577.46 --> 4582.38
but yeah she's she's gonna you know

4580.04 --> 4585.0199999999995
she's gotta handle she's got to be able

4582.38 --> 4588.02
to handle freaking our win man

4585.02 --> 4590.84
right remember how

4588.02 --> 4594.14
intense I can be

4590.84 --> 4596.3
oh all of that is still in there and my

4594.14 --> 4598.9400000000005
experience with women is that they

4596.3 --> 4600.860000000001
always scrape to the bottom of the

4598.94 --> 4603.86
barrel

4600.86 --> 4607.54
they like they always have to pull out

4603.86 --> 4607.54
everything for some reason

4607.76 --> 4612.9800000000005
when I'm in a relationship with I don't

4610.219 --> 4614.78
know why they always do that maybe I do

4612.98 --> 4618.339999999999
it to them too

4614.78 --> 4618.34
I don't know why

4633.14 --> 4639.679
I think's the same as me wow really

4637.159 --> 4640.759999999999
ah I don't know if that's possible

4639.679 --> 4643.36
though

4640.76 --> 4643.360000000001
but

4644.12 --> 4648.08
I'm not even sure exactly what I'm

4646.219 --> 4650.62
looking for at the type of mind I'm

4648.08 --> 4650.62
looking for

4658.52 --> 4662.84
I think I'd just like to start out with

4661.159 --> 4665.54
having

4662.84 --> 4668.62
female friends

4665.54 --> 4668.62
that will be great

4676.4 --> 4682.099999999999
a soul mate

4679.1 --> 4685.120000000001
yeah that good old myth of the soul mate

4682.1 --> 4685.120000000001
who knows man

4688.94 --> 4692.599999999999
women are becoming

4690.44 --> 4695.5599999999995
well multi TomTom that's never been an

4692.6 --> 4695.56
objection to me

4696.38 --> 4702.400000000001
half the girls I've dated all said they

4699.56 --> 4702.400000000001
were lesbians

4706.82 --> 4711.92
if they are in need of certain like

4709.4 --> 4715.159
female subtleties and characteristics

4711.92 --> 4717.4400000000005
not all of it then I can provide too I'm

4715.159 --> 4720.139999999999
a very sensitive guy

4717.44 --> 4721.759999999999
I understand vulnerability

4720.14 --> 4726.280000000001
yeah

4721.76 --> 4726.280000000001
my very first girlfriend was a lesbian

4730.4 --> 4735.879999999999
but yeah she had a we had still had it

4733.159 --> 4735.879999999999
like a year together

4752.96 --> 4758.36
you know in a way

4756.08 --> 4761.96
there is always one thing that I would

4758.36 --> 4763.88
be enjoying about being with a lesbian

4761.96 --> 4766.219
girl and that is that we could both

4763.88 --> 4768.679
appreciate other women

4766.219 --> 4770.3
that they'd get

4768.679 --> 4774.32
me

4770.3 --> 4777.14
it was funny like we never like

4774.32 --> 4780.5199999999995
or I didn't this is

4777.14 --> 4780.52
like me and my ex

4782.42 --> 4786.9800000000005
would just be like going around going

4784.58 --> 4789.8
out and then she pointed like oh look at

4786.98 --> 4792.04
that and I'd be like oh [ __ ] yeah I get

4789.8 --> 4792.04
that

4792.92 --> 4798.56
right we'd both be interested in

4796.04 --> 4801.38
beautiful women not to actually do

4798.56 --> 4804.38
anything about it with it or at least

4801.38 --> 4807.26
that I wasn't planning that

4804.38 --> 4809.2390000000005
but yeah that's the one thing that I

4807.26 --> 4812.54
always appreciate about being with a

4809.239 --> 4815.0
lesbian is that she could appreciate

4812.54 --> 4816.94
other women and wouldn't be like oh

4815.0 --> 4821.139
that's a nice guy because that's like

4816.94 --> 4821.138999999999
what do you mean it's a nice guy

4823.82 --> 4827.139
the less I

4829.82 --> 4834.5199999999995
mean no I don't think so not really it's

4832.1 --> 4834.52
difficult

4837.08 --> 4840.219
she said it

4850.52 --> 4857.92
right but like yeah half of the girls

4854.12 --> 4857.92
I've been with were lesbians

4859.12 --> 4862.26
[Music]

4864.38 --> 4869.4800000000005
but it's weird by the way because almost

4866.719 --> 4872.12
every girl I've ever approached since

4869.48 --> 4874.218999999999
then always say they're lesbian for some

4872.12 --> 4876.92
reason

4874.219 --> 4878.84
like I'm starting to like

4876.92 --> 4881.2390000000005
there's gonna be a point where I'm just

4878.84 --> 4882.8
going to completely ignore that she's

4881.239 --> 4885.099999999999
like oh I'm lesbian just like yeah I

4882.8 --> 4885.1
don't care

4895.82 --> 4898.659
like whatever

4901.9 --> 4909.0199999999995
like unless they are like really really

4905.0 --> 4911.179
lesbian like exclusively lesbian cannot

4909.02 --> 4915.860000000001
get themselves to like men

4911.179 --> 4918.8
for some reason those types always look

4915.86 --> 4922.5199999999995
have a certain look to them and I don't

4918.8 --> 4924.320000000001
really find those attractive

4922.52 --> 4926.320000000001
so

4924.32 --> 4929.96
I don't know

4926.32 --> 4932.139
right but enough about all that it's too

4929.96 --> 4932.139
much

4950.719 --> 4955.04
right Dusty ready well that's what I

4953.0 --> 4956.659
think too and I think also that a lot of

4955.04 --> 4958.76
lesbians

4956.659 --> 4961.339999999999
say they're less they're just scared of

4958.76 --> 4963.88
men that's it they're just scared of men

4961.34 --> 4963.88
that's it

4965.78 --> 4973.36
like they don't want to engage in that

4969.08 --> 4973.36
social ritual thing

4974.96 --> 4978.88
so they just hide with women

4979.58 --> 4984.28
there's a lot of that out here a lot

4991.639 --> 4996.62
that you can tell a real lesbian they're

4994.1 --> 4997.9400000000005
miserable that's weird that you'd say it

4996.62 --> 5000.699
because

4997.94 --> 5002.62
in a way

5000.699 --> 5004.839999999999
yeah

5002.62 --> 5007.9
but it doesn't they all don't have to be

5004.84 --> 5011.32
like overtly miserable but in yeah the

5007.9 --> 5012.94
the exclusive lesbians they do seem to

5011.32 --> 5016.0
have like this

5012.94 --> 5019.199
weird dissatisfied twist to them in

5016.0 --> 5019.199
their energy it's weird

5019.239 --> 5022.379999999999
from my experience

5026.26 --> 5033.280000000001
but maybe that is kind of like that

5029.38 --> 5036.52
maybe it is the hatred of men that

5033.28 --> 5038.139
causes that dissatisfaction not their

5036.52 --> 5040.06
love for women

5038.139 --> 5043.32
right have you ever considered that that

5040.06 --> 5043.320000000001
it's actually the hatred

5043.42 --> 5048.46
of the other sex that causes that and

5046.659 --> 5051.879999999999
then it's not

5048.46 --> 5054.96
their affinity and and love association

5051.88 --> 5054.96
with their own sex

5061.36 --> 5064.0199999999995
thank you

5068.56 --> 5073.139
hey Jade dreamers is that the real

5074.199 --> 5076.98

didn't you like move on to some other

5113.199 --> 5115.739
platform

5129.04 --> 5132.719
because you're no longer in my list

5163.659 --> 5166.259999999999

5178.6 --> 5184.92
I hope your your kids are staying clear

5181.0 --> 5184.92
of the vax crap and all that

5188.44 --> 5191.4
though Ben White

5213.4 --> 5218.709
foreign

5215.51 --> 5218.709
[Music]

5222.78 --> 5228.58
[Music]

5225.76 --> 5231.179
yeah for

5228.58 --> 5231.179
got that

5231.4 --> 5237.5199999999995
right but make sure they don't try to

5234.94 --> 5239.98
sneak it on your kid too with some kind

5237.52 --> 5241.659000000001
of crazy creepy ice cream

5239.98 --> 5243.4
truck

5241.659 --> 5245.44
because that sort of craps going around

5243.4 --> 5248.159
they're literally trying to sneak it to

5245.44 --> 5248.159
kids sometimes

5248.32 --> 5254.32
so you gotta be careful

5251.679 --> 5257.6990000000005
all right uh

5254.32 --> 5261.159
yeah Jay dreamer Z and me go way back

5257.699 --> 5263.58
like one of my first live streams I did

5261.159 --> 5263.58
with him

5263.98 --> 5267.959999999999
was it like the very very first

5270.58 --> 5276.639
let me check yeah no it's the second one

5274.42 --> 5279.639
second live stream I ever did was with

5276.639 --> 5282.96
him four years ago

5279.639 --> 5282.96
good old days

5304.78 --> 5310.86
all right check it out

5307.3 --> 5310.860000000001
that's an old [ __ ]

5343.36 --> 5347.98
that's so true

5345.58 --> 5352.5599999999995
getting wisdom

5347.98 --> 5352.5599999999995
that's like logos mechanisms

5377.32 --> 5380.46
no Ben White

5400.3 --> 5402.4800000000005
foreign

5410.679 --> 5416.219
I look like I have more muscles

5413.5 --> 5416.219
really

5416.56 --> 5423.400000000001
I do

5418.84 --> 5425.7390000000005
well I don't feel like that at all

5423.4 --> 5428.679
I've actually grown a little bit of a

5425.739 --> 5432.28
belly but it's still very minor so it's

5428.679 --> 5434.9400000000005
minute dude for I'm for someone in 41 I

5432.28 --> 5434.94
am really

5435.82 --> 5442.84
very much the same as I was 20 years ago

5440.44 --> 5445.659
I used to be skinnier well that could be

5442.84 --> 5448.0
but that's really because well I I

5445.659 --> 5451.12
happen to just talk about it

5448.0 --> 5452.739
earlier in the show that's because I was

5451.12 --> 5456.42
really sick

5452.739 --> 5458.62
like sick psychologically super super

5456.42 --> 5461.38
stressed out felt I was completely

5458.62 --> 5464.44
doomed like in a way getting on YouTube

5461.38 --> 5466.42
going flat Earth it was like my

5464.44 --> 5468.94
as I engaged

5466.42 --> 5470.7390000000005
I literally felt like this is the last

5468.94 --> 5473.32
thing I'm gonna do

5470.739 --> 5475.839999999999
in my life that's what it felt like

5473.32 --> 5477.4
because I was that

5475.84 --> 5480.719
messed up

5477.4 --> 5480.719
emotionally and [ __ ]

5483.82 --> 5489.28
so yeah I'm not surprised that it was

5486.04 --> 5490.36
really skinny just from Pure stress pure

5489.28 --> 5492.5199999999995
stress

5490.36 --> 5494.82
and I remember that I remember like

5492.52 --> 5497.9800000000005
literally being just stressed out

5494.82 --> 5501.34
constantly barely being able to find an

5497.98 --> 5505.08
escape for it it was like that for

5501.34 --> 5505.08
like three years straight

5507.1 --> 5511.0
starting at 2013.

5515.5 --> 5521.739
right you have fear literally eats you

5518.739 --> 5523.86
up like it literally made me skinny I

5521.739 --> 5523.86
think

5524.679 --> 5530.139
now I'm fine it's just fine I'm not

5527.86 --> 5531.46
really skinny anymore but it's not like

5530.139 --> 5534.6
an

5531.46 --> 5534.6
old fatty

5536.56 --> 5541.3
right

5539.02 --> 5543.719
I don't think these muscles have really

5541.3 --> 5543.719
grown

5545.199 --> 5550.599999999999
they either kind of stayed the same

5548.92 --> 5552.1
what

5550.6 --> 5554.679
huh

5552.1 --> 5557.320000000001
that's weird

5554.679 --> 5559.3
my arm does seem to have an increased

5557.32 --> 5562.12
diameter

5559.3 --> 5564.659000000001
what's going on

5562.12 --> 5564.659
huh

5565.96 --> 5568.679
that's weird

5569.02 --> 5574.659000000001
pure Beefcake

5571.8 --> 5577.179
that's that thank you for the compliment

5574.659 --> 5579.28
Tom Parker that is an absolute lie

5577.179 --> 5580.54
though

5579.28 --> 5583.0199999999995
no

5580.54 --> 5586.56
I am no

5583.02 --> 5586.56
90s Arnold

5588.76 --> 5592.1990000000005
hey Julio pavin

5597.699 --> 5603.759999999999
ew

5600.1 --> 5606.88
oh Daffy Duck and Ben white dude keep

5603.76 --> 5608.38
taking it keep taking keep shoving it in

5606.88 --> 5611.7390000000005
there

5608.38 --> 5614.1990000000005
every month yeah

5611.739 --> 5617.5
before you know it you'll have a

5614.199 --> 5621.099999999999
constant covet facts drip

5617.5 --> 5623.38
24 7. for the rest of your life which is

5621.1 --> 5627.06
probably not gonna last very long yeah

5623.38 --> 5629.4400000000005
you can have a constant influx of Kovacs

5627.06 --> 5630.88
constant drip

5629.44 --> 5633.04
because you want it right that's what

5630.88 --> 5635.1990000000005
you want

5633.04 --> 5637.9
you want that poison please give me the

5635.199 --> 5641.32
poison please please it's normal I'm

5637.9 --> 5643.719
okay because I'm a sock

5641.32 --> 5645.94
on a YouTube chat

5643.719 --> 5649.06
that doesn't have a face

5645.94 --> 5651.04
so if you have totally been [ __ ] up

5649.06 --> 5654.04
then you can still pretend that that

5651.04 --> 5656.139
didn't happen to try to encourage more

YouTube is OPC these days

5785.619 --> 5789.42
I don't know about that one

5789.46 --> 5796.02
they're just

5791.5 --> 5796.02
yeah what is PC even you know

5796.36 --> 5802.42
the the just yeah they're just political

5799.3 --> 5804.58
it's not even like PC it's just

5802.42 --> 5806.639
political

5804.58 --> 5811.719
like

5806.639 --> 5814.84
liberal fascist Marxist communist world

5811.719 --> 5816.159
domination mind control Neo feudal

5814.84 --> 5818.619000000001
political

5816.159 --> 5822.879999999999
right they're just like you know [ __ ]

5818.619 --> 5824.619
everyone to death that disagrees with us

5822.88 --> 5826.0
like

5824.619 --> 5828.339999999999
that's

5826.0 --> 5831.1
what they are really

5828.34 --> 5833.7390000000005
so it's it's not even like the 2000 like

5831.1 --> 5837.76
the Obama era PC anymore that was just

5833.739 --> 5840.4
like a a trendy thing a rage

5837.76 --> 5842.38
that people been programmed to death

5840.4 --> 5844.719
with but all of that is kind of like

5842.38 --> 5846.1
gone like nobody gives a [ __ ] about that

5844.719 --> 5848.32
anymore

5846.1 --> 5852.219
barely anybody does

5848.32 --> 5854.0199999999995
like a couple of like weenie teen groups

5852.219 --> 5856.42
or whatever that are into that and

5854.02 --> 5859.42
there's special little pronoun or

5856.42 --> 5862.36
whatever but outside of that like nobody

5859.42 --> 5864.28
gives a [ __ ] really

5862.36 --> 5867.759999999999
but they're still being

5864.28 --> 5871.36
just autocratic sensors

5867.76 --> 5874.6
for profit literally it's autocracy for

5871.36 --> 5877.0
profit it's very fascist

5874.6 --> 5879.639
how people get manipulated in their

5877.0 --> 5881.98
stats in their votes and everything and

5879.639 --> 5884.9800000000005
their reach

5881.98 --> 5887.199
it's only the things that give them a

5884.98 --> 5891.159
good name them profit that cover for

5887.199 --> 5893.379999999999
their executive crimes and all that

5891.159 --> 5895.659
that's

5893.38 --> 5899.46
how they operate

5895.659 --> 5904.719
give a [ __ ] about any principles only

5899.46 --> 5904.719
their own fascistic advantage

5905.44 --> 5909.719
Okay Google good luck with that

5958.56 --> 5963.84
wow Flat Earth train wreck

5964.199 --> 5969.5199999999995
you're the train wreck here

5967.239 --> 5972.4
you really think that you got your

5969.52 --> 5975.219
freaking jab crap

5972.4 --> 5977.92
that that's supposed to prevent you from

5975.219 --> 5979.659
going to the hospital you absolutely

5977.92 --> 5982.42
idiot

5979.659 --> 5985.299999999999
it's already admitted

5982.42 --> 5988.659
that actually the chance of getting

5985.3 --> 5991.360000000001
serious ailments whenever this new virus

5988.659 --> 5994.0599999999995
or whatever is going to go around that

5991.36 --> 5997.78
the chances of having extreme or even

5994.06 --> 6000.96
deadly responses to it enhances every

5997.78 --> 6002.219
time you take a covet shot every time

6000.96 --> 6004.86
you take it

6002.219 --> 6009.4800000000005
the chances you'll get an aggravated

6004.86 --> 6010.92
more deadly response when you get it

6009.48 --> 6013.86
yeah

6010.92 --> 6018.54
that's already admitted

6013.86 --> 6021.659
take the shot and you get it anyway like

6018.54 --> 6024.6
everybody that's taking the shot always

6021.659 --> 6027.42
ends up getting it anyway it's never

6024.6 --> 6029.400000000001
prevented a single person from actually

6027.42 --> 6033.06
getting it

6029.4 --> 6037.0199999999995
and then when you get it

6033.06 --> 6039.54
the way you get it is worse than when

6037.02 --> 6043.56
you haven't taken the covert shot yeah

6039.54 --> 6046.38
that's already admitted fact

6043.56 --> 6048.780000000001
people in Laboratories people with

6046.38 --> 6051.3
Statistics rolling that out telling you

6048.78 --> 6052.98
like yeah this yeah this is our

6051.3 --> 6054.900000000001
prognosis this is what's gonna happen

6052.98 --> 6057.599999999999
everybody that's taking the shots gonna

6054.9 --> 6061.739
have aggravated responses yeah hello

6057.6 --> 6064.139
hello how is taking your shot gonna

6061.739 --> 6067.638999999999
prevent you from getting in the hospital

6064.139 --> 6067.639
you idiot

6068.159 --> 6072.659
it's not it's actually enhanced that

6071.76 --> 6075.0
chance

6072.659 --> 6077.759999999999
yeah every time you take one of those

6075.0 --> 6080.76
Jabs you enhance the chance of ending up

6077.76 --> 6083.34
in a hospital every single time

6080.76 --> 6086.6990000000005
and it compounds

6083.34 --> 6088.4400000000005
yeah the risk is exponential the more

6086.699 --> 6091.099999999999
shots you get

6088.44 --> 6091.099999999999
idiot

6110.58 --> 6115.58
no you can't man wait you don't have a

6113.219 --> 6115.58
wrench

6116.1 --> 6121.02
and

6118.619 --> 6123.179
which specific video are you referring

6121.02 --> 6125.540000000001
to because I've seen some of those

6123.179 --> 6125.54
videos

6131.219 --> 6135.9
I think you're probably talking about

6133.32 --> 6136.98
the same videos Adam Meek and posted the

6135.9 --> 6139.138999999999
other day

6136.98 --> 6143.419999999999
short one

6139.139 --> 6143.42
I think I'll link you up with that

6143.52 --> 6146.84
it's under a minute

6150.3 --> 6153.1990000000005
check it out

6170.34 --> 6174.3
all right is that the link you were

6172.199 --> 6176.54
talking about Ben White is that the same

6174.3 --> 6176.54
link

6186.179 --> 6191.4
right so you can start what yeah dude

6188.04 --> 6194.82
this girl there are so many videos of

6191.4 --> 6197.0599999999995
prominent medical people trying to very

6194.82 --> 6199.32
carefully

6197.06 --> 6203.360000000001
worn against

6199.32 --> 6203.36
taking it it's good stuff

6203.4 --> 6208.739
it's a different one okay well dude

6206.04 --> 6211.199

6213.659 --> 6220.0199999999995

6217.139 --> 6224.28
because they have their own platform and

6220.02 --> 6227.280000000001
they really like try to get every

6224.28 --> 6229.44
good doctor video that explains like why

6227.28 --> 6231.96
it's bad news why you shouldn't be

6229.44 --> 6234.119
taking the shot they always get there

6231.96 --> 6236.3
they try to get there first and present

6234.119 --> 6236.299999999999
