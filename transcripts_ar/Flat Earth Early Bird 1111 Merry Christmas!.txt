and actually yeah the

139.84 --> 147.52
sun was like very bright in my room and

144.0 --> 150.319
i kind of got like over it tense so i

147.52 --> 152.64000000000001

in this it's very cold outside by the

152.64 --> 156.55999999999997

groups of friends

yeah

174.879 --> 179.599
so there is a constant wind blowing and

177.2 --> 181.83999999999997
it's really cold

179.599 --> 184.72
but yeah

181.84 --> 187.12
the sun does make up for it

184.72 --> 190.879
although yeah if as soon as that sun

187.12 --> 193.04
goes down it's gonna be cold

190.879 --> 195.2
for sure

193.04 --> 198.959
right

195.2 --> 201.11999999999998

forward to that

282.479 --> 285.479
huh

301.759 --> 305.199
yeah late last night

305.919 --> 312.4
also because like some

310.24 --> 314.32
people down there

312.4 --> 316.32
just had a party like in the middle of

314.32 --> 320.0
the night

316.32 --> 320.0
i think they were like drunk and [ __ ]

320.16 --> 324.639
and yeah their music they didn't really

322.4 --> 327.12
turn off the base

324.639 --> 329.6
eventually they put it on lower and then

327.12 --> 332.24
like yeah but they kept on going very

329.6 --> 334.47900000000004
late it was

332.24 --> 338.40000000000003
i kind of wanted to go to bed early but

334.479 --> 341.199
yeah that didn't happen because of that

338.4 --> 341.19899999999996
but oh well

342.24 --> 347.12
a lot of people over here in the

344.16 --> 349.03900000000004
netherlands they typically do go to like

347.12 --> 350.56
christmas parties

349.039 --> 353.759
but yeah those

350.56 --> 356.08
are not really out there a lot as far as

353.759 --> 360.16
i know unless you have

356.08 --> 362.08
like your v passport blah

360.16 --> 363.84000000000003
or something

362.08 --> 368.24
so i'm not surprised that they're just

363.84 --> 368.23999999999995
gonna do it at home then right

375.039 --> 379.759
oh yeah i got my

376.4 --> 383.56
my i got the cat for a visit

379.759 --> 383.56
sleeping right there

406.08 --> 410.8
oh yeah and was i was also watching owen

408.4 --> 413.039
benjamin

410.8 --> 415.599
from yesterday's stream

413.039 --> 417.36
got to the first hour he's basically

415.599 --> 420.319
going through all the

417.36 --> 423.039
all the typical christmas songs and

420.319 --> 425.03900000000004
kind of like pointing out how not very

423.039 --> 427.68
christian it is but it's but it's

425.039 --> 427.68
hilarious

430.96 --> 433.96
right

436.8 --> 442.639
also flat earth debates was pretty okay

440.56 --> 445.599
i was

442.639 --> 447.44
weirdly kind of slurry though not

445.599 --> 450.56
not because of anything

447.44 --> 452.71999999999997
i just

450.56 --> 455.12
i didn't flow really well for some

452.72 --> 455.12
reason

455.44 --> 458.479
don't really know why

458.56 --> 464.8
but oh well

461.599 --> 467.68
the show my own show was pretty fluid

464.8 --> 467.68
yesterday i thought

468.8 --> 471.28000000000003
anyway

475.919 --> 479.56
how are you all doing

495.52 --> 498.52
huh

507.36 --> 513.28
watched the james webb telescope rocket

511.039 --> 513.28
oh

518.839 --> 524.08
okay it was some kind of a launch or

521.68 --> 524.0799999999999
something

528.48 --> 533.24
man why is it so freaking cold

541.36 --> 547.32
does get really cold what is the

543.6 --> 547.32
temperature actually

547.53 --> 550.65
[Music]

552.24 --> 558.32
one degree hmm

555.12 --> 558.32
very low humidity

558.64 --> 562.64
right makes sense

560.08 --> 566.64
oh and according to this

562.64 --> 568.64
prediction chart yeah it is gonna freeze

566.64 --> 571.76
up to like minus three

568.64 --> 571.76
this night so

589.839 --> 591.9200000000001
you

616.72 --> 622.64
anyway yeah yesterday's flat earth

618.399 --> 624.64
debate was like very christmasy themed

622.64 --> 628.959
just goofing around a lot

624.64 --> 628.959
it was funny it was it was fun

629.6 --> 632.6
uh

633.36 --> 638.72
good day okay timer

635.92 --> 638.7199999999999
ah okay

639.6 --> 643.0400000000001
probably in the sea now yeah

645.68 --> 652.1999999999999
you got any link to that

648.64 --> 652.1999999999999
i'll take a look

698.64 --> 702.959
right

699.76 --> 704.079
yeah today i don't know what it is

702.959 --> 704.959
but

704.079 --> 707.3599999999999
today

704.959 --> 708.4799999999999
just my tension is a little

707.36 --> 710.16
tough

708.48 --> 713.48
i guess it's the combination of the

710.16 --> 713.48
bright weather

718.16 --> 722.399
so there's a lot going on also going

720.959 --> 724.4799999999999
through me

722.399 --> 726.48
most of the afternoon i was just like it

724.48 --> 728.48
was just kept on

726.48 --> 730.8000000000001
going and going

728.48 --> 733.8000000000001
but right now like i can't really reach

730.8 --> 733.8
it

753.92 --> 756.56
maybe

755.12 --> 758.399
yeah that'll

756.56 --> 760.399
get a little better as the

758.399 --> 764.519
show progresses

760.399 --> 764.519
didn't troll right

774.0 --> 779.72
the buzzing is back

776.56 --> 779.7199999999999
is it

788.88 --> 791.88
hmm

801.519 --> 804.76
all right

819.76 --> 825.76
yeah that's weird because yeah the sound

821.92 --> 827.76
does seem to like pick up something

825.76 --> 830.88
maybe there is like a weird tone going

827.76 --> 830.88
through the place right now

837.199 --> 841.04
i don't know if it's my computer though

839.12 --> 843.04
i don't think so

841.04 --> 845.8389999999999
pick up my mic

843.04 --> 845.8389999999999
okay i'll try

852.32 --> 855.32
uh

861.519 --> 864.519
well

870.639 --> 873.12
does it

873.839 --> 879.379
instantly gone okay

876.09 --> 879.379
[Music]

882.48 --> 887.9200000000001
well yeah well you're right as soon as i

885.279 --> 891.92
put it back the bar does

887.92 --> 891.92
go up it does pick up something

892.959 --> 896.3599999999999
that's weird

921.92 --> 924.92
uh

940.079 --> 945.12
well sorry george sanford there's really

941.92 --> 945.12
nothing i can do about it

945.44 --> 952.24
or i'd have to like put on a filter

949.68 --> 955.8389999999999
but then you'd hear it back as soon as i

952.24 --> 955.839
start talking so

956.639 --> 962.639
mike on my i don't have a mouse pad

960.56 --> 964.88
that sure okay i'll

962.639 --> 966.24
put it on something

964.88 --> 968.32
put it on this

966.24 --> 969.92
toilet roll or something maybe that will

968.32 --> 973.1990000000001
help

969.92 --> 973.199
it's gonna be in the way though

974.32 --> 979.519
yeah that does seem to help

977.759 --> 982.15
but now it's

979.519 --> 985.25
sticking out like a

982.15 --> 985.25
[Music]

999.199 --> 1002.4799999999999
right i'll think of something

1004.24 --> 1008.24
but this should work temporarily

1018.56 --> 1022.43
[Music]

1032.079 --> 1037.6399999999999
hey godzilla

1034.24 --> 1037.64
merry christmas

1038.4 --> 1041.4
huh

1089.28 --> 1095.44
right by the way yeah i'm already

1092.84 --> 1098.1599999999999
tomorrow i'm probably not gonna have a

1095.44 --> 1099.52
show tomorrow

1098.16 --> 1101.039
unless i'm like

1099.52 --> 1103.28
really

1101.039 --> 1105.76
high energy in a good way and

1103.28 --> 1107.6789999999999
i start early

1105.76 --> 1109.36
because if not then i'm not gonna do

1107.679 --> 1111.52
show tomorrow

1109.36 --> 1114.32
because in the afternoon i'm gonna go to

1111.52 --> 1114.32
my dad's and

1114.72 --> 1119.2
yeah

1116.0 --> 1121.84
it would be too much

1119.2 --> 1124.96
compact and all together and all that we

1121.84 --> 1124.9599999999998
kind of have to prepare

1130.96 --> 1135.559
but yeah today i got all the time

1162.84 --> 1167.84
right but if i'm gonna be feeling like

1165.919 --> 1171.2
i'm feeling right now i think i'm

1167.84 --> 1175.8799999999999
probably gonna be sleeping a whole lot

1171.2 --> 1175.88
i don't know why i feel like this

1180.0 --> 1183.88
probably because it's freezing

1193.44 --> 1200.679
tomorrow's the day everybody runs to a

1195.679 --> 1200.679
store to buy out of date products huh

1216.72 --> 1219.88
all right

1221.44 --> 1224.44
ugh

1240.64 --> 1245.2800000000002
my family's christmas is tomorrow too

1243.039 --> 1248.52
all right so i'm not the only one that

1245.28 --> 1248.52
does that

1249.2 --> 1255.2
oh look usually really big and connected

1251.679 --> 1255.2
families have like multiple

1255.679 --> 1260.2800000000002
two or three christmas day celebrations

1262.799 --> 1265.799
ugh

1287.36 --> 1290.4799999999998
yeah by the way i have really noticed

1289.6 --> 1293.039
that

1290.48 --> 1296.039
like the sun is really intense for some

1293.039 --> 1296.039
reason

1305.44 --> 1309.679
i thought it was even kind of surprising

1307.28 --> 1314.24
as i was taking my walk

1309.679 --> 1316.3200000000002
that even with cold wind and all that

1314.24 --> 1319.72
that i could just still feel the heat

1316.32 --> 1319.72
from the sun

1320.559 --> 1325.24
through all that cold so yeah

1331.25 --> 1334.359
[Music]

1353.919 --> 1358.0800000000002
what's the pendant i wear

1356.4 --> 1359.44
it's a pen that i've been wearing for

1358.08 --> 1362.08
years now

1359.44 --> 1365.679
it's a flower life

1362.08 --> 1368.559
carved in pure silver

1365.679 --> 1368.5590000000002
made it myself

1368.799 --> 1375.32
years ago

1371.36 --> 1375.32
like 10 years ago

1375.44 --> 1378.679
no more

1407.44 --> 1412.24
it's really weird looking at that mic at

1409.679 --> 1412.24
eye height

1413.919 --> 1419.3200000000002
but yeah it does really seem to help

1415.84 --> 1419.32
against the vibration

1434.4 --> 1439.5590000000002
you like things that have meaning yeah

1436.24 --> 1439.559
me too

1467.919 --> 1470.24
yeah

1470.4 --> 1475.279
dude i'm a little slow today and i swear

1473.12 --> 1475.279
i

1475.36 --> 1477.9189999999999
i don't know

1478.96 --> 1484.48
just feel kind of woozy

1482.08 --> 1484.48
weird

1484.88 --> 1489.279
although i do have memories that that

1486.88 --> 1490.88
kind of happens sometimes with me when

1489.279 --> 1493.52
it's like really freezing during

1490.88 --> 1493.5200000000002
christmas time

1494.08 --> 1498.24
because i have lots of memories of like

1496.08 --> 1500.0
everybody being all busy and crowded

1498.24 --> 1502.159
with the family and i'm just sitting

1500.0 --> 1504.72
there like uh

1502.159 --> 1506.4
not because i'm like drunk or that i was

1504.72 --> 1508.32
drunk or anything

1506.4 --> 1510.3200000000002
like not at all

1508.32 --> 1512.72
it would like even as i was sorry i

1510.32 --> 1515.72
would just get

1512.72 --> 1515.72
woozy

1516.0 --> 1520.08
and i think it has something to do with

1517.679 --> 1522.159
the bright sun

1520.08 --> 1524.32
because when it's all clouded up it

1522.159 --> 1527.5590000000002
doesn't really happen

1524.32 --> 1527.559
it's weird

1561.5 --> 1564.609
[Music]

1570.159 --> 1573.159
ugh

1598.159 --> 1604.48
oh yeah gortilla yeah i didn't watch it

1601.36 --> 1607.799
but i did see that come by

1604.48 --> 1607.799
in a list

1616.559 --> 1621.799
yeah there's all kinds of goofiness

1618.08 --> 1621.799
going on out there

1646.559 --> 1651.6789999999999
absolutely clue just that man

1648.96 --> 1651.679
may yeah

1652.84 --> 1658.799
partially or he's at the point where he

1655.6 --> 1661.36
just doesn't give a [ __ ] anymore

1658.799 --> 1664.9189999999999
he's like yeah sure let's go brandon

1661.36 --> 1664.9189999999999
whatever man

1682.88 --> 1687.1200000000001
yeah thanks for that george sanford

1695.039 --> 1697.84
no way they did

1698.96 --> 1704.559
hey wrath no notification no i was just

1701.6 --> 1704.559
really late today

1706.159 --> 1711.7600000000002
i started at 3 p.m

1710.0 --> 1712.64
because i yeah

1711.76 --> 1715.52
felt

1712.64 --> 1718.159
weirdly over tense again it's very

1715.52 --> 1720.08
bright out there

1718.159 --> 1722.88
and this night i was kind of kept up by

1720.08 --> 1725.6789999999999
a bunch of drunk

1722.88 --> 1728.24
yeah yeah

1725.679 --> 1730.96
but to drunk friends

1728.24 --> 1735.039
having a party

1730.96 --> 1735.039
like blabbering all loud and [ __ ]

1736.559 --> 1741.6789999999999
it's okay eventually they they kind of

1738.64 --> 1741.679
figured out that it was

1741.84 --> 1745.36
that they were being very loud

1746.08 --> 1751.6
all the combination of it all

1749.52 --> 1753.76
so yeah i took a walk

1751.6 --> 1756.48
which yeah it's a great

1753.76 --> 1759.84
it looks really amazing out there

1756.48 --> 1760.88
so it is definitely like taking a walk

1759.84 --> 1762.8799999999999
time

1760.88 --> 1765.279
and i did

1762.88 --> 1769.0
and wasn't allowing huge amounts of

1765.279 --> 1769.0
people walking

1773.3 --> 1776.4099999999999
[Music]

1787.12 --> 1792.279
yeah wrath thanks merry christmas to you

1789.279 --> 1792.279
too

1795.279 --> 1798.159
finally

1796.32 --> 1800.3
the days are going to grow longer can't

1798.159 --> 1819.6190000000001
wait

1800.3 --> 1819.619
[Music]

1822.64 --> 1826.24
i hope you were dreaming of a green

1824.48 --> 1829.039
christmas what

1826.24 --> 1829.039
what does that mean

1833.2 --> 1837.52
now i i had very restless dream i'm

1835.76 --> 1839.44
finally getting to the point where i can

1837.52 --> 1841.76
start talking again

1839.44 --> 1844.3200000000002
it's a tension again guys i don't know

1841.76 --> 1846.32
what it is

1844.32 --> 1848.559
it's

1846.32 --> 1848.559
it's

1849.279 --> 1854.48
considering with what i got going

1851.919 --> 1856.64
through my mind and the kinds of ideas i

1854.48 --> 1858.159
get and that i could potentially talk

1856.64 --> 1859.96
about

1858.159 --> 1863.6000000000001
this tension thing is like a

1859.96 --> 1865.8400000000001
catastrophic problem for me

1863.6 --> 1867.84
it is it's becoming a catastrophic

1865.84 --> 1870.559
problem

1867.84 --> 1874.399
because i miss it i i'm literally just

1870.559 --> 1876.799
sitting here not like oh clueless but

1874.399 --> 1880.7199999999998
facing that i have all these things i

1876.799 --> 1880.72
potentially want to try to talk about

1881.44 --> 1884.72
and i just can't do it

1885.039 --> 1890.399
like it would make me throw up

1888.399 --> 1894.559
from the tension

1890.399 --> 1898.6399999999999
and then ruin like you make it all worse

1894.559 --> 1898.6399999999999
like get my head spinning or something

1898.799 --> 1902.799
i don't know

1900.48 --> 1906.559
i really hope it's just the freaking

1902.799 --> 1908.6399999999999
ancestral winds thing i mean

1906.559 --> 1911.44
i didn't have this kind of stuff like

1908.64 --> 1911.44
during the summer

1912.71 --> 1915.799
[Music]

1918.84 --> 1928.399
right hello elise good to see you

1923.3 --> 1930.08
[Music]

1928.399 --> 1932.4799999999998
but yeah during the summer i mean

1930.08 --> 1934.48
sometimes i might have like drunken too

1932.48 --> 1937.1200000000001
much and then get sick the next day but

1934.48 --> 1940.24
then they're really perfectly fine after

1937.12 --> 1943.12
it's just that the last few months

1940.24 --> 1946.32
last month or more

1943.12 --> 1949.4399999999998
i just feel like i can't do it

1946.32 --> 1951.12
i feel like a tree

1949.44 --> 1952.3990000000001
losing its leaves

1951.12 --> 1956.8799999999999
kind of thing

1952.399 --> 1960.6399999999999
i think that's probably good comparison

1956.88 --> 1960.64
but i know it will be back

1961.44 --> 1966.0
but like despite that like there's

1964.399 --> 1970.7199999999998
internally

1966.0 --> 1970.72
a lot going on like a lot

1972.0 --> 1975.2
and

1973.84 --> 1978.0
there's less

1975.2 --> 1980.24
room for me now to basically

1978.0 --> 1983.36
do anything with it but it's there's

1980.24 --> 1983.36
more going on

1983.59 --> 1988.08
[Music]

1985.519 --> 1988.08
inside

1988.24 --> 1993.35
just comparing stuff on like

1990.72 --> 1995.679
almost every level

1993.35 --> 1998.559
[Music]

1995.679 --> 2001.6000000000001
i'm like there's this giant reverse

1998.559 --> 2003.9189999999999
engineering refinement process going on

2001.6 --> 2008.08
internally energy-wise spirit-wise

2003.919 --> 2008.0800000000002
spirit mechanics fractal thinking

2009.2 --> 2011.44
and

2014.159 --> 2019.279
it's so much energy

2016.24 --> 2023.519
but i like i can't get it out it's just

2019.279 --> 2023.519
internal and it's kind of punishing at

2030.84 --> 2034.8899999999999
times right and it reflected to me in my

2034.08 --> 2036.24
dreams

2034.89 --> 2037.76
[Music]

2036.24 --> 2040.0
where

2037.76 --> 2040.0
well

2041.919 --> 2048.56
or i was kind of restless too

2044.64 --> 2052.399
and like the characters

2048.56 --> 2054.96
yeah portrayed to be humans other others

2052.399 --> 2058.96
were also responding to that and kind of

2054.96 --> 2060.639
negatively like they were like oh

2058.96 --> 2061.679
he's

2060.639 --> 2063.9190000000003
weak and

2061.679 --> 2066.399
like he's being like this again and like

2063.919 --> 2069.04
impatient and it's like not a good

2066.399 --> 2072.3199999999997
sensation at all yeah guess what in the

2069.04 --> 2075.839
past i've had a whole lot of that

2072.32 --> 2075.839
there's nothing i can do about it

2076.079 --> 2078.3990000000003
yeah

2078.96 --> 2083.28
so yeah i had dreams but they were

2084.159 --> 2089.04
draining maybe that's partially why i'm

2086.48 --> 2091.28
kind of why i feel so knackered

2089.04 --> 2093.679
even though i didn't have overall pretty

2091.28 --> 2095.3590000000004
good rest despite

2093.679 --> 2098.48
having been kept up

2095.359 --> 2101.48
a bit because of the party next door

2098.48 --> 2101.48
huh

2103.27 --> 2106.36
[Music]

2106.72 --> 2109.9199999999996
oh did i miss a joke

2112.24 --> 2116.4799999999996
what

2113.85 --> 2119.52
[Music]

2116.48 --> 2120.35
oh my god no no

2119.52 --> 2123.42
i didn't

2120.35 --> 2123.42
[Music]

2124.16 --> 2128.839
i was just busy talking

2126.8 --> 2130.48
just trying to lay

2128.839 --> 2133.92
down

2130.48 --> 2136.4
well part of the issue why i'm like this

2133.92 --> 2136.4
right now

2136.61 --> 2141.329
[Music]

2141.44 --> 2146.64
just kind of yeah because

2144.4 --> 2148.96
i just learned it's just a very basic

2146.64 --> 2151.2799999999997
principle right and works on all levels

2148.96 --> 2153.359
if you just express what's going on

2151.28 --> 2156.079
somehow if you find a way to find some

2153.359 --> 2158.56
expression it's like

2156.079 --> 2159.52
this is even what artists use it's that

2158.56 --> 2162.0789999999997
drive

2159.52 --> 2164.48
once you express it

2162.079 --> 2166.96
you get room usually things clear up at

2164.48 --> 2168.72
least temporary while the process is

2166.96 --> 2172.0
going while the contact is going or

2168.72 --> 2175.839
while you're like working on your art

2172.0 --> 2179.52
right that's why a whole bunch of people

2175.839 --> 2181.44
that are kinda like me

2179.52 --> 2183.52
and that feel the same things that i'm

2181.44 --> 2186.32
going through right now will probably

2183.52 --> 2188.96
typically try to jump towards something

2186.32 --> 2188.96
artistic

2190.079 --> 2194.88
a whole bunch of people would

2192.079 --> 2196.2400000000002
for example get obsessed with christmas

2194.88 --> 2198.2400000000002
decorations

2196.24 --> 2199.359
which is kind of artistic too or it's at

2198.24 --> 2201.68
least like

2199.359 --> 2204.0
assembly creative and

2201.68 --> 2205.04
yeah you can do anything with it

2204.0 --> 2207.839
right

2205.04 --> 2211.52
to keep you busy to

2207.839 --> 2213.2799999999997
kind of like get the unrest out

2211.52 --> 2215.68
[Music]

2213.28 --> 2218.4
and at the same time there's also a

2215.68 --> 2221.2
different energy just right now

2218.4 --> 2222.8
where everything is kind of clearer and

2221.2 --> 2225.5989999999997
deeper

2222.8 --> 2228.2400000000002
gets closer and i think that applies to

2225.599 --> 2232.0
everybody i think that just

2228.24 --> 2233.04
like the spirit lamp energy is just very

2232.0 --> 2235.68
high

2233.04 --> 2237.359
and with mixed results because of that

2235.68 --> 2239.839
because yeah not everybody could take

2237.359 --> 2241.68
that some people

2239.839 --> 2243.839
kind of freak out

2241.68 --> 2245.68
when again really closed off

2243.839 --> 2248.24
or they get really

2245.68 --> 2250.48
easily agitated and just whiney all the

2248.24 --> 2250.4799999999996
time

2251.119 --> 2255.599
but there is like this

2253.28 --> 2258.4
deeper energy

2255.599 --> 2258.4
that reaches

2259.04 --> 2263.44
closer much closer to your heart also

2261.44 --> 2264.5
more close to this weird timeless

2263.44 --> 2266.16
sensation

2264.5 --> 2269.39
[Music]

2266.16 --> 2273.44
like it's almost yeah

2269.39 --> 2275.839
[Music]

2273.44 --> 2275.839
anyway

2275.89 --> 2280.3199999999997
[Music]

2278.079 --> 2282.5600000000004
there's something

2280.32 --> 2285.839
heavy about this time

2282.56 --> 2287.839
and that's probably every year

2285.839 --> 2289.119
but especially when it freezes and it's

2287.839 --> 2290.96
this bright

2289.119 --> 2292.96
sun

2290.96 --> 2294.88
everything just gets really intense

2292.96 --> 2297.599
people get intense

2294.88 --> 2299.6800000000003
animals too by the way

2297.599 --> 2301.9300000000003
they'll either get sleepy or they get

2299.68 --> 2306.0789999999997
super restless

2301.93 --> 2309.0789999999997

2306.079 --> 2309.079

2338.839 --> 2344.56

2346.56 --> 2351.2799999999997
that yeah

2348.72 --> 2352.9599999999996
i would say to that second part yes and

2351.28 --> 2355.6800000000003
no

2352.96 --> 2358.079
depends on the context right it really

2355.68 --> 2360.48
does because it could be a yes it could

2358.079 --> 2362.48
be you know

2360.48 --> 2364.72
depends yeah but yeah it kind of

2362.48 --> 2367.72
automatic yeah it's difficult you know

2364.72 --> 2367.72
esoterics

2372.48 --> 2376.48
but i guess from a generally christian

2374.64 --> 2380.56
view

2376.48 --> 2380.56
you can only interpret it one way

2381.52 --> 2387.2
but right anyway

2384.16 --> 2389.52
this is hdmi traveler

2387.2 --> 2391.68
merry christmas time to open gifts with

2389.52 --> 2394.079
my children ah that's great have fun

2391.68 --> 2394.0789999999997
with that

2394.24 --> 2398.4799999999996
i mean you probably put in a lot of work

2400.32 --> 2404.48
i mean santa did

2402.56 --> 2406.4
whatever

2404.48 --> 2409.4
yeah anyway i hope you have a great day

2406.4 --> 2409.4

2411.119 --> 2415.04
well good yeah thank you good servant

2412.96 --> 2417.599
for the two dollar super chat merry

2415.04 --> 2417.599
christmas

2419.599 --> 2423.92
fairly confident that jesus knew what he

2421.839 --> 2425.839
was saying i'm not saying that he didn't

2423.92 --> 2428.56
i'm saying that

2425.839 --> 2430.24
what we think he is saying

2428.56 --> 2432.0789999999997
could be wrong

2430.24 --> 2434.0
right

2432.079 --> 2436.0
rose colored darkly

2434.0 --> 2438.4
it's a certain

2436.0 --> 2440.56
lens of where you are at with your

2438.4 --> 2443.599
consciousness and spirit and your

2440.56 --> 2443.599
knowledge at the time

2444.72 --> 2450.24
i'm simply saying there could even be

2446.72 --> 2452.48
more interpretations which would yeah

2450.24 --> 2455.4399999999996
which contrast

2452.48 --> 2457.359
the way you're thinking of it right now

2455.44 --> 2460.599
yeah that's what i'm actually doing it i

[Music]

2473.28 --> 2476.96
right because no one comes through the

2474.96 --> 2478.8
father except for me like what does that

2476.96 --> 2480.88
mean does that

2478.8 --> 2485.2000000000003
indicate the conscious

2480.88 --> 2488.319
ascension is the only way to get to god

2485.2 --> 2490.319
like the deepening of conscious and it

2488.319 --> 2493.04
resolving

2490.319 --> 2496.56
everything in yourself

2493.04 --> 2496.56
and then finding the clarity

2497.359 --> 2503.359
so that would indicate through me as as

2500.0 --> 2506.319
in the path that he walks like how that

2503.359 --> 2508.48

[Music]

2574.0 --> 2579.319
hey service day

how are you doing

2592.45 --> 2598.77

okay italian cat fine

2633.11 --> 2639.449
[Music]

2644.8 --> 2648.1600000000003
if that's the way you want to see it

2646.4 --> 2650.48
then

2648.16 --> 2652.0
it's your prerogative but

2650.48 --> 2656.0
i think i see

2652.0 --> 2656.0
more potentially a lot more in it

2657.28 --> 2661.88
than just a

2658.88 --> 2661.88
confirmation

2670.64 --> 2675.72
did i see james webb cartoon no

2678.16 --> 2681.56
you got a link

2685.16 --> 2688.25
[Music]

2690.4 --> 2695.359
all right no i i didn't think you were

2692.72 --> 2697.68
chao young cat i know but yeah i know

2695.359 --> 2697.68
you're

2699.839 --> 2706.96
yeah you don't have safonya syndrome

2702.8 --> 2706.96
you're a very decent person i'm okay

2707.44 --> 2711.17
i'm

2708.319 --> 2712.8
being a bit competitive

2711.17 --> 2715.599
[Music]

2712.8 --> 2718.319
but that's just

2715.599 --> 2720.6400000000003
yeah that's just the way i communicate

2718.319 --> 2723.52
sometimes if i'm if it's really

2720.64 --> 2725.68
important to me then i will

2723.52 --> 2729.359
bring it with more passion and that can

2725.68 --> 2731.44
be interpreted as aggression

2729.359 --> 2733.359
usually when i get aggressive you will

2731.44 --> 2736.7200000000003
know the difference

2733.359 --> 2736.72
because that's kind of scary

2742.56 --> 2747.52
i'm just

2743.839 --> 2749.44
intense that's the way i am it's kind of

2747.52 --> 2752.079
weird i guess

2749.44 --> 2752.079
foremost

2754.96 --> 2757.96
ah

2764.64 --> 2767.64
oh

2768.92 --> 2771.9990000000003
[Music]

2775.52 --> 2778.52
hmm

2792.96 --> 2804.319
five minute video with cgi oh

2798.17 --> 2805.46
[Music]

2804.319 --> 2808.48
what

2805.46 --> 2811.9700000000003
[Music]

2808.48 --> 2816.659
so they just show cgi

2811.97 --> 2816.6589999999997
[Music]

2819.119 --> 2823.159
one

2820.09 --> 2823.159
[Music]

2825.359 --> 2844.48
what is that

2827.42 --> 2846.8
[Music]

2844.48 --> 2846.8
hmm

2848.079 --> 2854.4
they love doing that don't they

2851.119 --> 2854.4
it's the whole new thing

2854.72 --> 2859.1189999999997
like

2856.079 --> 2860.96
camera on the inside

2859.119 --> 2863.599
like this egg

2860.96 --> 2866.0
that they then hatch in space and it's

2863.599 --> 2868.4
like woof oh look it's in space now or

2866.0 --> 2868.4
something

2868.88 --> 2880.88
i like doing that

2871.29 --> 2880.88
[Music]

2881.2 --> 2887.7999999999997
yeah but like all that cgi build up to

2884.24 --> 2887.7999999999997
that and was ridiculous

2898.72 --> 2902.8799999999997
it turns into a cartoon real quick yeah

2903.599 --> 2908.6800000000003
like in not in a computer game it's like

2906.48 --> 2912.57
a computer game screen

2908.68 --> 2912.5699999999997
[Music]

2915.119 --> 2919.96
too closely to film oh sure

2930.59 --> 2933.6890000000003
[Music]

2937.09 --> 2943.4190000000003
[Music]

2951.68 --> 2958.319
yeah the cgi ball earth in the

2954.4 --> 2961.2000000000003
background is like extra sloppy

2958.319 --> 2961.2
like that looks

2961.599 --> 2965.2000000000003
like late 90s

2963.92 --> 2968.2400000000002
graphics

2965.2 --> 2968.24
for the ball in the

2968.839 --> 2973.44
background i didn't even try to make it

2971.839 --> 2975.31
look realistic

2973.44 --> 2978.38
in that cgi

2975.31 --> 2978.38
[Music]

2993.119 --> 2996.839
are losing it

2998.64 --> 3003.04
i'm still not entirely sure what they're

3000.72 --> 3006.319
even doing

3003.04 --> 3009.2
whether they are trying to

3006.319 --> 3011.68
perpetuate space or whether they are

3009.2 --> 3013.9199999999996
kind of like just trying to destroy it

3011.68 --> 3016.72
while profiteering off it i'm not even

3013.92 --> 3019.92
sure what they're doing anymore

3016.72 --> 3019.9199999999996
haven't been for a while

3020.96 --> 3024.96
but

3021.68 --> 3027.359
the whole thing seems more

3024.96 --> 3028.7200000000003
like it is more of a psychological

3027.359 --> 3032.5589999999997
operation

3028.72 --> 3034.8799999999997
than even an artistic representatory

3032.559 --> 3038.8390000000004
representatory

3034.88 --> 3042.319
project like all of this nasa and all

3038.839 --> 3045.2799999999997
that it seems like it's more preoccupied

3042.319 --> 3045.2799999999997
with kind of like

3049.44 --> 3056.319
just psychological trauma control and

3052.48 --> 3056.319
just weird double speaking

3058.16 --> 3061.92
like extreme

3059.68 --> 3064.0789999999997
contrasts that contradict one another

3061.92 --> 3067.079
and nobody addresses it that sort of

3064.079 --> 3067.079
thing

3067.95 --> 3073.04
[Music]

3070.8 --> 3074.96
because like the quality

3073.04 --> 3076.88
of everything it doesn't even seem to

3074.96 --> 3078.64
matter that much anymore maybe that was

3076.88 --> 3081.359
the business plan maybe it's just a

3078.64 --> 3084.0789999999997
corporate choice it's like okay

3081.359 --> 3086.4
we can just do our utmost best to make

3084.079 --> 3089.119
it like super perfect if it's going to

3086.4 --> 3090.4
be expensive

3089.119 --> 3092.559
or

3090.4 --> 3095.839
we could simply make

3092.559 --> 3099.0400000000004
the whole communication go in kind of a

3095.839 --> 3100.88
dilapidated deranged

3099.04 --> 3103.68
way

3100.88 --> 3106.559
so that we'll just have a crowd

3103.68 --> 3108.5589999999997
that's dumbed down or confused

3106.559 --> 3111.76
so they won't even

3108.559 --> 3113.76
care whether it's fake or not

3111.76 --> 3116.1600000000003
they'll be too preoccupied with some

3113.76 --> 3117.119
political point they're trying to defend

3116.16 --> 3119.1189999999997
within

3117.119 --> 3121.52
this within

3119.119 --> 3123.44
the framework of it all maybe that was

3121.52 --> 3125.839
the business plan in the first place i

3123.44 --> 3125.839
don't know

3126.8 --> 3133.28
because

3128.48 --> 3138.4
it seems like they are on purpose

3133.28 --> 3140.38
keeping flaws in what they do

3138.4 --> 3141.52
like it's mandatory

3140.38 --> 3143.92
[Music]

3141.52 --> 3147.2
it's mandatory not to

3143.92 --> 3150.6800000000003
upgrade the quality

3147.2 --> 3150.68
for some reason

3159.86 --> 3175.11
[Music]

3175.92 --> 3178.92
what

3186.65 --> 3189.7290000000003
[Music]

3190.319 --> 3194.079
see yeah yeah but tell you and cat the

3192.319 --> 3196.319
whole issue is is that they're getting

3194.079 --> 3198.1600000000003
lazy

3196.319 --> 3200.4
they're like oh just fill it up with an

3198.16 --> 3203.44
animation

3200.4 --> 3205.44
like no no we actually want to or well

3203.44 --> 3207.359
the ballers

3205.44 --> 3209.76
people looking for evidence and all that

3207.359 --> 3210.96
they want the real thing they want real

3209.76 --> 3213.76
camera

3210.96 --> 3217.28
not animation

3213.76 --> 3221.0
but they're doing that more and more

3217.28 --> 3221.0
it's just being lazy

3222.96 --> 3228.2400000000002
hopefully q1 on people wake up no way in

3226.16 --> 3230.96
hell

3228.24 --> 3232.72
surface day q1 on

3230.96 --> 3235.839
is a project

3232.72 --> 3238.8799999999997
it's a cia project

3235.839 --> 3241.52
there to specifically

3238.88 --> 3246.319
not do that

3241.52 --> 3246.319
it's like everything is okay except

3247.119 --> 3253.599
you don't touch space you don't touch

3250.559 --> 3253.599
flat earth all that

3259.359 --> 3261.68
yes

3263.04 --> 3266.079
oh there's that too

3268.079 --> 3273.119
yeah trump is not making himself popular

3273.52 --> 3279.92
because he is and hey i called it

3276.319 --> 3282.0
even a year ago it's been in my hashtag

3279.92 --> 3285.359
lists

3282.0 --> 3286.88
right trump is a shill and it seems like

3285.359 --> 3289.2
he's like

3286.88 --> 3291.2000000000003
contracted to shill for this medical

3289.2 --> 3293.839
crap

3291.2 --> 3296.3999999999996
the shilling might be going very deep

3293.839 --> 3298.16
and i wonder if he even realized what

3296.4 --> 3302.2400000000002
he's doing with it

3298.16 --> 3302.24
or whether he truly believes

3302.48 --> 3306.2400000000002
like

3303.28 --> 3308.799
like everything is propaganda so it's up

3306.24 --> 3311.04
to the individual

3308.799 --> 3313.52
whether it is real or not and he just

3311.04 --> 3315.92
wants to believe that vaccines can lead

3313.52 --> 3317.599
to something good and maybe that's why

3315.92 --> 3319.28
he's persisting

3317.599 --> 3322.2400000000002
it would be very

3319.28 --> 3325.6800000000003
trumpishly stubborn

3322.24 --> 3326.8799999999997
and potentially catastrophically

3325.68 --> 3329.7599999999998
stubborn

3326.88 --> 3331.119
but he is just presenting himself like a

3329.76 --> 3334.3190000000004
shill

3331.119 --> 3338.319
for vaccines

3334.319 --> 3338.319
like a professional shill

3338.88 --> 3344.1600000000003
and he's actually kind of

3341.28 --> 3347.119
doing it pretty well considering the

3344.16 --> 3350.72
insane circumstances

3347.119 --> 3353.6800000000003
right to actually just be try to be an

3350.72 --> 3356.0789999999997
honest chill for vaccines

3353.68 --> 3357.44
while a vast majority of even your own

3356.079 --> 3358.88
fans

3357.44 --> 3361.04
are like

3358.88 --> 3363.52
really done with that trick and like no

3361.04 --> 3366.48
no

3363.52 --> 3369.119
and he's still doing it's crazy

3366.48 --> 3371.76
it's crazy what he's doing

3369.119 --> 3375.119
but it just feels like he is just

3371.76 --> 3379.119
abiding to a contract he has to

3375.119 --> 3381.599
make vaccines look good somehow

3379.119 --> 3383.359
because he knows it's not popular he has

3381.599 --> 3387.28
to know that

3383.359 --> 3387.2799999999997
so he's approaching it in another way

3387.359 --> 3392.319
he's very good at mine well is he really

3391.359 --> 3393.92
because

3392.319 --> 3395.92
that like

3393.92 --> 3399.6800000000003
if you're very good at mind control

3395.92 --> 3399.6800000000003
that's something you're not gonna do

3402.48 --> 3406.96
you're not gonna go against the grain of

3404.799 --> 3407.93
like everybody that's been supporting

3406.96 --> 3409.359
you

3407.93 --> 3411.7599999999998
[Music]

3409.359 --> 3414.319
now that's just pigheaded or it's like

3411.76 --> 3416.07
mandatory contract something he can't

3414.319 --> 3419.159
get out of

3416.07 --> 3419.159
[Music]

3424.079 --> 3426.88
right

3425.04 --> 3430.319
because he's literally

3426.88 --> 3432.799
ruining his own momentum by doing this

3430.319 --> 3434.0
he's built a lot of momentum a lot of

3432.799 --> 3434.72
fame

3434.0 --> 3437.119
and

3434.72 --> 3438.8799999999997
kind of deservedly so he's put a lot of

3437.119 --> 3442.1600000000003
energy in it

3438.88 --> 3444.7200000000003
you know his speeches love for life big

3442.16 --> 3445.68
huge audiences he's done a lot of work

3444.72 --> 3449.68
with that

3445.68 --> 3449.68
by doing this he's literally

3451.28 --> 3456.0
poisoning his own well effectively by

3453.68 --> 3460.7599999999998
doing this so there must be a really

3456.0 --> 3460.76
damn good reason for him to do that

3461.839 --> 3466.5589999999997
because he is literally now just

3464.24 --> 3470.04
poisoning his own well all that momentum

3466.559 --> 3470.0400000000004
he built up

3488.48 --> 3493.119
people trust the jab still

3491.68 --> 3496.72
look

3493.119 --> 3499.2000000000003
it's not even clear like what his total

3496.72 --> 3501.04
attitude is but he is

3499.2 --> 3503.839
trying to shield he is trying to be

3501.04 --> 3503.839
apologetic

3505.02 --> 3510.839

3507.599 --> 3510.839

[Music]

3519.76 --> 3523.5200000000004
i mean there look

3521.359 --> 3526.5589999999997
this is the situation there will

3523.52 --> 3526.559
eventually end up

3527.04 --> 3530.799
a huge

3528.559 --> 3532.88
amount of

3530.799 --> 3535.28
vaccinated

3532.88 --> 3537.599
people with this

3535.28 --> 3539.92
the jabs all that

3537.599 --> 3542.079
that are gonna regret it and that might

3539.92 --> 3545.839
live for quite a long time and still

3542.079 --> 3548.4
have things they can do right

3545.839 --> 3550.24
so there's going to be a lot of them

3548.4 --> 3552.2400000000002
they're going to seek

3550.24 --> 3554.9599999999996
their own champion that

3552.24 --> 3557.2
so he's yeah trump seems to be now like

3554.96 --> 3557.2
oh

3557.28 --> 3561.92
just it's about freedom you can't

3559.44 --> 3564.96
mandate it and all that but still doing

3561.92 --> 3568.0
it that's just oh

3564.96 --> 3568.0
what are you doing man

3568.799 --> 3573.359
there's better ways to to get out of

3571.04 --> 3574.16
that

3573.359 --> 3576.319
and

3574.16 --> 3577.92
i wonder if did he really take it

3576.319 --> 3580.16
himself or was

3577.92 --> 3583.119
he said it so

3580.16 --> 3584.72
with a hard tone when he said yes

3583.119 --> 3587.119
that seemed

3584.72 --> 3588.799
like a lie like i don't believe that he

3587.119 --> 3591.28
actually took it

3588.799 --> 3591.28
no way

3591.78 --> 3597.3590000000004

3596.079 --> 3599.04

3597.359 --> 3600.4
the general

3599.04 --> 3602.4
v

3600.4 --> 3604.799
that is going around

3602.4 --> 3608.0
there's no way

3604.799 --> 3611.68
he would never knowingly take that

3608.0 --> 3611.68
because he knows it's bad news

3611.76 --> 3618.88
like he knows people are sick of it

3615.2 --> 3621.4399999999996
literally and figuratively

3618.88 --> 3623.52
but he might still kind of believe in

3621.44 --> 3625.839
vaccination

3623.52 --> 3629.16
as in the industry maybe has some

3625.839 --> 3630.24
special high hopes

3629.16 --> 3632.799
[Music]

3630.24 --> 3633.5989999999997
i mean there is a lot of

3632.799 --> 3636.72
well

3633.599 --> 3639.119
potentially really dangerous but a lot

3636.72 --> 3641.839
of development

3639.119 --> 3644.0
had that has happened in that industry

3641.839 --> 3646.0789999999997
and yeah we're getting a whole bunch of

3644.0 --> 3647.599
bad sides of those developments

3646.079 --> 3649.6800000000003
unfortunately

3647.599 --> 3650.799
because there's crazy people at the helm

3649.68 --> 3654.799
that are

3650.799 --> 3657.52
like using all this momentum and power

3654.799 --> 3660.52
to ram through their eugenics vision of

3657.52 --> 3660.52
depopulation

3660.799 --> 3665.68
and

3661.92 --> 3665.6800000000003
i just wonder if trump

3667.28 --> 3671.2000000000003
like what does he how much is he aware

3669.68 --> 3674.5589999999997
of that

3671.2 --> 3674.5589999999997
like is he because

3674.799 --> 3678.72
like he might just be a freaking

3676.64 --> 3680.0789999999997
eugenicist guys

3678.72 --> 3682.3999999999996
and hey

3680.079 --> 3684.799
looking how he's had to like

3682.4 --> 3687.71
what he's had to deal with

3684.799 --> 3689.52
overall people wise out there

3687.71 --> 3691.52
[Music]

3689.52 --> 3694.319
he might just be like

3691.52 --> 3695.68
convinced that yeah there's not it has

3694.319 --> 3697.359
to be done

3695.68 --> 3699.7599999999998
like this is only going to get worse

3697.359 --> 3701.92
with so many people but i i can't

3699.76 --> 3704.1600000000003
believe that because that so

3701.92 --> 3707.04
diametrically opposes

3704.16 --> 3708.3999999999996
everything that he's

3707.04 --> 3711.64
been saying

3708.4 --> 3711.64
with heart

3712.16 --> 3718.5589999999997
he's a guy that does kind of like trust

3716.88 --> 3720.799
groups of people and trust their

3718.559 --> 3723.119
dynamics so it

3720.799 --> 3724.32
it's just something really freaky going

3723.119 --> 3733.8790000000004
on

3724.32 --> 3733.8790000000004
[Music]

3739.92 --> 3746.0
like it it could be

3742.48 --> 3748.559
just a really terrible

3746.0 --> 3750.0
ticket to the dark side we're seeing it

3748.559 --> 3751.8390000000004
could be that

3750.0 --> 3755.2
got to realize got to keep that in mind

3751.839 --> 3758.4
this could be literally

3755.2 --> 3760.48
trump's anakim skywalker moment where he

3758.4 --> 3762.88
turns to darth vader

3760.48 --> 3765.76
like he really goes for it

3762.88 --> 3769.52
despite everything he had hopes and

3765.76 --> 3772.559
dreams before that that's all then

3769.52 --> 3775.48
sacrificed by those actions and that

3772.559 --> 3778.4
changes the purses dramatically

3775.48 --> 3781.52
dramatically in everything they do it

3778.4 --> 3783.599
always does you can never return to what

3781.52 --> 3785.839
was before that

3783.599 --> 3788.6400000000003
so this could be

3785.839 --> 3790.0
a really dark roll out of where trump is

3788.64 --> 3794.0789999999997
going

3790.0 --> 3794.079
like i'm kind of nervous about it

3794.799 --> 3798.48
because

3795.599 --> 3799.92
trump was so effective

3798.48 --> 3802.559
when he was

3799.92 --> 3804.2400000000002
on the light side

3802.559 --> 3806.0
then what is he gonna be like when he

3804.24 --> 3808.839
actually turns to the dark side that

3806.0 --> 3812.96
could be a genuinely painful nightmare

3808.839 --> 3814.96
guys not just spazzing out gama gamma's

3812.96 --> 3818.2400000000002
corridors that are all higher marty

3814.96 --> 3821.28
nobility like wannabes but like a

3818.24 --> 3824.24
genuinely dark minded [ __ ] up

3821.28 --> 3826.4
individual that has still has massive

3824.24 --> 3830.16
charisma

3826.4 --> 3832.2400000000002
that's scary guys like really scary what

3830.16 --> 3834.8799999999997
could roll out of that

3832.24 --> 3836.799
so i'm really worried what trump is

3834.88 --> 3839.119
doing like

3836.799 --> 3841.0389999999998
i'm looking at the distance right the

3839.119 --> 3843.2000000000003
media and i see people

3841.039 --> 3845.3590000000004
discussing about alex jones like really

3843.2 --> 3847.359
made a point about it

3845.359 --> 3849.52
and yeah i'm glad he did

3847.359 --> 3851.2799999999997
because it is really worrisome and this

3849.52 --> 3853.839
could be

3851.28 --> 3853.8390000000004
scary

3855.27 --> 3862.079
[Music]

3858.72 --> 3862.0789999999997
sounds like the antique

3864.0 --> 3868.28
i would more compare it to

3866.4 --> 3869.839
anakin going to the dark side

3868.28 --> 3871.92
[Music]

3869.839 --> 3876.799
don't forget that what happens in the

3871.92 --> 3876.799
movie while that happens it's [ __ ] up

3877.839 --> 3884.88
it's still very bad

3880.88 --> 3887.28
but you all know that darth vader

3884.88 --> 3890.559
like what he was like

3887.28 --> 3895.8390000000004
in the star wars movies how imposing he

3890.559 --> 3895.8390000000004
actually was like and he carried that

3900.88 --> 3907.039
but still imperial always imperial you

3905.359 --> 3909.52
see

3907.039 --> 3912.2400000000002
and if trump is going to be like that

3909.52 --> 3915.68
it's going to be a problem

3912.24 --> 3918.72
because yeah a lot of these

3915.68 --> 3920.8799999999997
want to be new nobility family

3918.72 --> 3924.319
politicians bankers all that that have

3920.88 --> 3925.92
been setting up the new world order plan

3924.319 --> 3929.0389999999998
they

3925.92 --> 3931.359
were mildly effective they were mostly

3929.039 --> 3933.6800000000003
effective with kind of like creating

3931.359 --> 3936.72
mind control systems and narratives and

3933.68 --> 3939.5989999999997
all that but overall the government name

3936.72 --> 3942.3999999999996
has not been very successful and it's to

3939.599 --> 3945.3590000000004
be expected

3942.4 --> 3948.76
if trump turns guys that could change

3945.359 --> 3948.7599999999998
and that's like

3950.64 --> 3955.359
that's gonna mean a whole nother level

3952.799 --> 3960.96
of bad news that kind of starts to apply

3955.359 --> 3960.96
to everything like a seriously dark time

3961.599 --> 3965.119
i don't know this is getting a bit fake

3963.52 --> 3967.28
now i just

3965.119 --> 3968.88
i just want to emphasize that yeah it

3967.28 --> 3971.039
really worries me

3968.88 --> 3974.6400000000003
trump has really turned to the dark side

3971.039 --> 3974.6400000000003
like this and he's like really

3975.2 --> 3981.359
going there

3976.48 --> 3981.359
and staying there then we got a problem

3981.76 --> 3985.8390000000004
right because just letting him go and

3984.0 --> 3988.16
saying oh i'm give up on trump that's

3985.839 --> 3991.0389999999998
not going to stop it

3988.16 --> 3992.24
he's still going to keep going

3991.039 --> 3993.039
and if

3992.24 --> 3994.72
the

3993.039 --> 3997.44
the good guys

3994.72 --> 4000.24
don't side with him anymore then he's

3997.44 --> 4002.44
gonna seek his crowd somewhere else

4000.24 --> 4004.9599999999996
and he will find it

4002.44 --> 4009.319

yeah

4028.96 --> 4033.76
he might be

4030.319 --> 4035.359
he's one creepy damn damn creepy dude

4033.76 --> 4036.7200000000003
that's for sure

4035.359 --> 4039.839
like he's

4036.72 --> 4041.839
radiating just creepiness

4039.839 --> 4043.2

4041.839 --> 4045.52

4043.2 --> 4047.359
a dark spirit

4045.52 --> 4048.799

4050.079 --> 4055.119
it's hard to describe it's just all

4052.16 --> 4058.3999999999996
kinds of spiritual activity there that i

4055.119 --> 4062.2400000000002
picked up on very i picked up on it in

4058.4 --> 4064.88
the dark world already

4062.24 --> 4067.2799999999997
dude as soon as trump came on my radar i

4064.88 --> 4069.039
immediately started just intuitively

4067.28 --> 4070.48
warning like yeah but be careful his

4069.039 --> 4072.4
family his family is going to be his

4070.48 --> 4073.52
downfall

it's just

4158.4 --> 4163.679
the way that looks

4160.96 --> 4163.679
this is just

4164.159 --> 4168.719
sometimes i just look outside at

4166.4 --> 4172.239
something that's like one of the most

4168.719 --> 4174.64
basic things right just

4172.239 --> 4176.959999999999
just look outside

4174.64 --> 4177.92
in nature it's always there it's like

4176.96 --> 4180.2390000000005
that

4177.92 --> 4182.799
cyclically every year but sometimes i

4180.239 --> 4186.919999999999
just look outside and i'm just like my

4182.799 --> 4186.92
mind is blown like

4190.56 --> 4196.0
like what am i actually seeing

4193.759 --> 4198.719
what is that light

4196.0 --> 4200.96
what is the sunlight

4198.719 --> 4203.36
why does it look like that why does it

4200.96 --> 4206.88
reflect off things like that

4203.36 --> 4209.04
why does sunlight reflect

4206.88 --> 4211.76
and shine

4209.04 --> 4214.84
off things differently

4211.76 --> 4218.320000000001
than man-made light

4214.84 --> 4221.679
because it's like this i just feel like

4218.32 --> 4223.199
it's holographic like it's really

4221.679 --> 4227.679
really different

4223.199 --> 4227.678999999999
totally different from everything else

4228.239 --> 4231.839999999999

4230.239 --> 4234.0
that it's just

4231.84 --> 4237.4400000000005
i don't just see

4234.0 --> 4237.44

4251.92 --> 4257.679

4255.44 --> 4261.599999999999
it's but the holographic light from the

4257.679 --> 4264.8
sun is just more than any man-made light

5853.36 --> 5857.5199999999995
constantly like biting the [ __ ] out of

5855.52 --> 5858.8
them or anything

5857.52 --> 5861.4400000000005
i mean like

5858.8 --> 5864.639
occasionally

5861.44 --> 5867.119
but not not constantly right but

5864.639 --> 5868.88
when i went to vacation to like

5867.119 --> 5871.36
spain

5868.88 --> 5873.119
and yeah we would seek out during that

5871.36 --> 5876.0
time when i liked horse riding and all

5873.119 --> 5877.36
that we would seek out like

5876.0 --> 5879.36
like oh let's

5877.36 --> 5881.28
you can take a little tour on a horse

5879.36 --> 5882.88
through the wilds

5881.28 --> 5884.96
with a guide

5882.88 --> 5887.28
right we would do that sort of thing was

5884.96 --> 5890.639
really fun

5887.28 --> 5893.119
although it's all slow it's like just

5890.639 --> 5895.36
it's nothing spectacular except for the

5893.119 --> 5895.36
view

5895.679 --> 5899.4400000000005
but

5896.639 --> 5902.719
yeah those horses they

5899.44 --> 5905.28
had wounds and [ __ ] from just massive

5902.719 --> 5905.28
amounts of

5905.6 --> 5912.159000000001
hornets and horseflies

5908.56 --> 5915.1990000000005
it was crazy like almost always during

5912.159 --> 5918.199
the summer which is when we were there

5915.199 --> 5918.199
crazy

5918.35 --> 5926.3
[Music]

5926.4 --> 5931.33
but nothing like that ever here in the

5928.56 --> 5939.29
netherlands thank god

5931.33 --> 5939.29
[Music]

5945.52 --> 5949.360000000001
doesn't sound like they should be

5947.04 --> 5951.5199999999995
happening that foreign but they do but

5949.36 --> 5953.599999999999
they do rest ahead

5951.52 --> 5956.719
look if there's like swamp regions

5953.6 --> 5958.639
somewhere there that really escape the

5956.719 --> 5961.04
savage cold

5958.639 --> 5963.36
then that's literally like a retreat to

5961.04 --> 5966.159
all those types of insects especially

5963.36 --> 5967.5199999999995
blood sucking insects

5966.159 --> 5969.44
right

5967.52 --> 5971.84
that are going to use that as a as a

5969.44 --> 5971.839999999999
base

5973.119 --> 5976.86
and then they're just going to go for

5974.48 --> 5979.28
all the animals out there

5976.86 --> 5983.349999999999
[Music]

5979.28 --> 5986.449
so that makes perfect sense

5983.35 --> 5986.4490000000005
[Music]

5996.33 --> 6009.969
[Music]

6011.04 --> 6015.92
yeah

6012.0 --> 6019.8
yeah guns never yeah wasps

6015.92 --> 6019.8
wasps really suck

6026.08 --> 6030.96
although i have managed to prevent

6028.08 --> 6032.9
getting stung by any of them for a long

6030.96 --> 6037.61
long time

6032.9 --> 6037.61
[Music]

6038.8 --> 6043.1990000000005
like wasps can be

6040.96 --> 6043.199
yeah

6044.88 --> 6049.400000000001
they can get so

6046.4 --> 6049.4
aggressive

6050.639 --> 6055.36
if you like slap like slap them around

6053.28 --> 6058.719
or something they'll be like eh no we

6055.36 --> 6058.719
won't be slapped around

6059.679 --> 6063.4800000000005
it's nasty creatures

6068.56 --> 6072.4800000000005
right but i haven't been stung by a wasp

6070.719 --> 6074.4800000000005
for a long time and i don't kill them

6072.48 --> 6076.239
anymore either i just

6074.48 --> 6079.28
be like

6076.239 --> 6082.638999999999
just capture them in a in a glass with a

6079.28 --> 6084.0
piece of paper and just like get out

6082.639 --> 6085.76
don't come back

6084.0 --> 6088.159
but i don't kill them anymore i think

6085.76 --> 6089.76
that they probably know that when you do

6088.159 --> 6092.799999999999
that

6089.76 --> 6095.84
it's like wasps can just feel it on you

6092.8 --> 6098.0
if you're a wasp killer

6095.84 --> 6100.96
and then they get like

6098.0 --> 6103.119
they basically treat you

6100.96 --> 6104.719
like you're an anti-wasp racist or

6103.119 --> 6107.04
something

6104.719 --> 6109.28
you get they get extra punishy and they

6107.04 --> 6109.28
do

6111.52 --> 6116.320000000001
and i think flies by the way regular

6113.6 --> 6119.679
flies have that too like they know when

6116.32 --> 6120.88
you kill flies and then they get extra

6119.679 --> 6123.679
annoying

6120.88 --> 6125.52
this is an extra hard to catch i think

6123.679 --> 6128.2390000000005
there's actually flies out there that

6125.52 --> 6129.84
just make it into a game

6128.239 --> 6131.28
like they want to be hunted because

6129.84 --> 6132.4800000000005
they're so freaking quick

6131.28 --> 6135.84
[Music]

6132.48 --> 6135.839999999999
sometimes of flies

6141.52 --> 6145.52
but yeah i just have a bug capturing

6144.08 --> 6147.199
policy

6145.52 --> 6150.400000000001
i don't kill them

6147.199 --> 6150.4
except for mosquitoes

6159.04 --> 6165.4
but yeah you can't really capture a

6160.88 --> 6168.8
mosquito they're too fragile anyway

6165.4 --> 6170.879999999999
[Music]

6168.8 --> 6173.76
yeah yeah dragonflies eat a lot of

6170.88 --> 6177.84
mosquitoes too

6173.76 --> 6177.84
and so do bats by the way

6181.76 --> 6185.08
and swallows

6195.46 --> 6198.55

well i'm not really a fan of black

6274.4 --> 6280.159
i know snakes i don't know i'm not

6276.8 --> 6280.159000000001
really scared of snakes

6284.96 --> 6289.28
i mean i know poisonous ones can be

6287.199 --> 6291.678999999999
dangerous of course but

6289.28 --> 6291.679
like i

6292.1 --> 6295.169000000001
[Music]

6295.92 --> 6301.719
but yeah

6297.679 --> 6301.719
i'm not super scared of snakes

6308.32 --> 6314.639999999999
[Music]

6319.44 --> 6324.44
yeah yeah service day i know

6327.0 --> 6342.25
[Music]

6345.26 --> 6348.39
[Music]

6354.639 --> 6362.0
right well 101 rock on again it but the

6358.4 --> 6362.0
thing about snakes is right

6362.88 --> 6368.32
they will never do anything unexpected

6366.32 --> 6371.759999999999
the only times you get in trouble with

6368.32 --> 6374.639
snakes is when they are alerted to your

6371.76 --> 6376.8
presence and you are not

6374.639 --> 6379.4400000000005
like if you don't see them and you don't

6376.8 --> 6381.679
pick up you're too preoccupied yeah they

6379.44 --> 6383.28
might suddenly like ah you're too close

6381.679 --> 6385.76
bite

6383.28 --> 6388.08
yeah that sucks so if you just know

6385.76 --> 6389.6
where they are

6388.08 --> 6392.159
then everything is all right and they

6389.6 --> 6394.56
become like you just have to be aware of

6392.159 --> 6396.638999999999
them what they're doing

6394.56 --> 6399.39
they're very easy

6396.639 --> 6400.96
really most snakes

6399.39 --> 6402.719
[Music]

6400.96 --> 6405.76
like they're very predictable you just

6402.719 --> 6407.679
got to know where they are that's all

6405.76 --> 6410.08
they have no interest in coming after

6407.679 --> 6413.04
you it's only like a proximity

6410.08 --> 6414.88
territorial thing at best

6413.04 --> 6419.8
accidents usually with snakes only

6414.88 --> 6419.8
happen because you don't see them

6428.67 --> 6440.88
[Music]

6438.4 --> 6441.679
don't thread on them yeah

6440.88 --> 6442.88
but

6441.679 --> 6445.92
you know

6442.88 --> 6448.0
that's indeed don't thread on them

6445.92 --> 6450.88
but most importantly

6448.0 --> 6452.56
know where they are

6450.88 --> 6453.6
right because why would you threat on

6452.56 --> 6455.92
the snake

6453.6 --> 6458.400000000001
the only reason why you would thread on

6455.92 --> 6460.0
the snake and they might is because you

6458.4 --> 6461.36
don't know where they are because you

6460.0 --> 6464.159
didn't

6461.36 --> 6467.48
pay attention to where you were walking

6464.159 --> 6467.48
what's there

6473.199 --> 6477.04
that's kind of the funny part about it

6477.199 --> 6482.839999999999
and like the whole don't thread on me

6480.8 --> 6486.159000000001
flag thing and all

6482.84 --> 6488.400000000001
that it's like yeah but

6486.159 --> 6490.239
okay snake we won't threaten you but

6488.4 --> 6491.839999999999
yeah we don't really know where you are

6490.239 --> 6494.239
though you're still like hiding in the

6491.84 --> 6494.2390000000005
grass

6496.88 --> 6501.36
you know that's a bit of a problem

6499.52 --> 6503.360000000001
can't see you then

6501.36 --> 6507.04
yeah we don't want to thread on you but

6503.36 --> 6507.04
yeah we can't really see where you are

6510.639 --> 6515.28
right and the rattlesnakes are awesome

6513.04 --> 6518.96
because of that because they do actually

6515.28 --> 6518.96
give you auditory warning

6521.04 --> 6523.76
it's brilliant

6522.56 --> 6525.360000000001
really

6523.76 --> 6527.76
because they're

6525.36 --> 6530.48
like they're usually

6527.76 --> 6533.04
blend into like the background deserty

6530.48 --> 6536.0
like rocky stuff

6533.04 --> 6539.04
and so yeah they blend in very well they

6536.0 --> 6543.04
can just sneak up on a creature

6539.04 --> 6545.28
on a rodent or something strike have it

6543.04 --> 6548.0
right they won't see it coming but if

6545.28 --> 6549.679
they're territorial

6548.0 --> 6551.119
then they'll make a lot of noise and

6549.679 --> 6553.679
then you'll definitely know they're

6551.119 --> 6556.88
there even over a distance it's

6553.679 --> 6558.08
it's brilliant it's a brilliant

6556.88 --> 6561.2390000000005
design

6558.08 --> 6561.239
a rattlesnake

6569.52 --> 6573.76
right but yeah if you know he's rattling

6571.76 --> 6578.04
and you're still gonna go forward yeah

6573.76 --> 6578.04
then it's on you you know

6586.56 --> 6591.599
right but yeah the snake also has to see

6588.719 --> 6594.8
you coming although most snakes

6591.599 --> 6596.56
very vibrant vibration sensitive

6594.8 --> 6597.599
so even if they're laying in the grass

6596.56 --> 6599.119000000001
somewhere

6597.599 --> 6601.360000000001
long grass

6599.119 --> 6603.04
they'll probably feel you coming but i

6601.36 --> 6604.08
don't know maybe if you're like rushing

6603.04 --> 6605.5199999999995
through it

6604.08 --> 6607.28
then they

6605.52 --> 6609.1990000000005
won't have time to respond and they'll

6607.28 --> 6612.8
freak out

6609.199 --> 6615.36
so yeah don't rush through high grass

6612.8 --> 6617.52
unless you got some seriously sturdy

6615.36 --> 6619.28
high boots

6617.52 --> 6623.09
perhaps

6619.28 --> 6626.179999999999
they got to be like really thick

6623.09 --> 6626.18
[Music]

6628.08 --> 6632.679
if there's snakes around that is

6633.65 --> 6641.619
[Music]

6650.84 --> 6655.1990000000005
hmm

6652.56 --> 6658.080000000001
i've seen a couple of snakes

6655.199 --> 6659.919999999999
not really spectacular was in spain

6658.08 --> 6662.4
there's like a couple of like pretty

6659.92 --> 6664.4
tame snakes there's no rattlesnakes or

6662.4 --> 6666.4
anything nothing big

6664.4 --> 6669.429999999999
but like there are snakes in the woods

6666.4 --> 6671.5199999999995
there here and there

6669.43 --> 6675.119000000001
[Music]

6671.52 --> 6675.119000000001
sometimes you find the snakeskin

6676.159 --> 6683.4
but they're like really small snakes and

6678.239 --> 6683.4
they like really go only after rodents

6697.89 --> 6709.26
[Music]

6706.08 --> 6712.339
alrighty then kevlar

6709.26 --> 6712.339
[Music]

6713.44 --> 6717.199
how did we get talking about this

6717.44 --> 6721.199
let's think it started with the weather

6719.04 --> 6725.51
and then igloos and then moved on to

6721.199 --> 6743.199
nature oh yeah mosquitoes in canada

6725.51 --> 6743.1990000000005
[Music]

6753.28 --> 6757.4
what is making all that sound

6758.57 --> 6761.679999999999
[Music]

6764.91 --> 6768.01
[Music]

6770.8 --> 6776.88
is the bus still there

6774.08 --> 6778.4
because it seems like the sound is now

6776.88 --> 6780.0
pretty much equal

6778.4 --> 6782.638999999999
whether it's

6780.0 --> 6786.639
directly on my desk or

6782.639 --> 6786.639
on top of it on this roll

6787.36 --> 6791.639
seems exactly the same now

6806.8 --> 6810.96
see a lot of snakes in wood piles oh

6808.88 --> 6813.36
they like to hang around there

6810.96 --> 6813.36
all right

6816.639 --> 6819.639
hmm

6836.32 --> 6841.92
what sounds like an alarm clock

6838.88 --> 6841.92
what are you talking about

6844.719 --> 6848.119
come on rasta

6849.76 --> 6854.280000000001
stop dissing on your own territories

6882.32 --> 6887.44
really kevlar that's really weird

6885.199 --> 6889.44
because there's literally nothing going

6887.44 --> 6892.0
on out there

6889.44 --> 6894.4
hasn't been any kind of emergency car or

6892.0 --> 6894.4
something

6895.599 --> 6899.119000000001
like i mean

6896.8 --> 6901.360000000001
the radiator seems to be

6899.119 --> 6902.799999999999
doing something maybe that's what you're

6901.36 --> 6905.839999999999
hearing but

6902.8 --> 6905.84
i don't know

6905.92 --> 6908.4800000000005
better now

6909.76 --> 6912.08
yeah

6912.4 --> 6916.4
i don't know what was giving that sound

6914.48 --> 6919.199
i don't know

6916.4 --> 6921.679
i don't know why sometimes it just picks

6919.199 --> 6924.879999999999
up something and i don't and then oh

6921.679 --> 6927.84
it's over i don't hear a difference

6924.88 --> 6927.84
i don't understand

6929.119 --> 6932.119
uh

6933.76 --> 6939.04
believers the probably in america no

6936.239 --> 6941.28
that's problem everywhere rasta you know

6939.04 --> 6941.28
that

6942.08 --> 6945.08
everywhere

6945.15 --> 6948.719
[Music]

6946.88 --> 6952.32
it's just that

6948.719 --> 6953.679
believer expressions tend to annoy you

6952.32 --> 6957.96
more

6953.679 --> 6957.96
when they're close by apparently

6987.92 --> 6994.56
the bible believers are not the problem

6992.32 --> 6994.5599999999995
well

6996.4 --> 7000.159
well

6997.44 --> 7004.0
partially they kind of are godzilla

7000.159 --> 7005.36
because of well-cut christianity

7004.0 --> 7009.28
right

7005.36 --> 7011.28
i mean a closed church

7009.28 --> 7012.8
technically is better

7011.28 --> 7015.44
in my opinion

7012.8 --> 7017.360000000001
than a open church with freaking

7015.44 --> 7018.879999999999
vaccination mandates and

7017.36 --> 7022.4
[Music]

7018.88 --> 7023.92
like politically correct corrections

7022.4 --> 7025.759999999999
[ __ ]

7023.92 --> 7028.2390000000005
in whatever

7025.76 --> 7031.56
it's better to just have a close church

7028.239 --> 7031.5599999999995
then so

7032.32 --> 7034.799999999999
you know

7041.119 --> 7046.88
i mean what good is christianity when

7043.84 --> 7048.0
everybody's just playing

7046.88 --> 7050.2390000000005
a game

7048.0 --> 7052.96
with it like just be part of the group

7050.239 --> 7054.879999999999
and do whatever supposedly the christian

7052.96 --> 7057.76
priesthood says even though everything

7054.88 --> 7061.1990000000005
about it is already so far

7057.76 --> 7064.56
beyond what they should have ever done

7061.199 --> 7067.36
like is that really good at that point

7064.56 --> 7067.360000000001
i don't think so

7067.679 --> 7073.4800000000005
i think it would be better to just close

7069.599 --> 7073.4800000000005
all churches than instead

7076.239 --> 7081.5199999999995
or actually keep one open and then

7078.8 --> 7084.320000000001
really really fight for it

7081.52 --> 7087.599
to have it completely

7084.32 --> 7090.719
exempt for any sort of influence any

7087.599 --> 7092.400000000001
influence medical political any any

7090.719 --> 7094.96
influence like

7092.4 --> 7096.879999999999
truly untouchable like we're gonna do it

7094.96 --> 7098.0
exactly

7096.88 --> 7098.8
the way

7098.0 --> 7101.84
we

7098.8 --> 7101.84
decide to do it

7103.119 --> 7107.199
no

7104.0 --> 7110.4
pandering no appeasing any stupid little

7107.199 --> 7112.719
trends or crazy out of control

7110.4 --> 7114.96
propaganda drunk people

7112.719 --> 7117.52
right nothing like that

7114.96 --> 7120.88
it's critical it's the whole point

7117.52 --> 7120.88
it's the whole point of it

7122.56 --> 7126.76
to escape from all that

7130.719 --> 7136.2390000000005
yeah if you're just nice people and you

7133.679 --> 7139.52
call yourself christians and you [ __ ] to

7136.239 --> 7139.5199999999995
literally everything

7139.599 --> 7144.08
that even jesus himself like strictly

7142.48 --> 7145.919999999999
warned you about

7144.08 --> 7148.32
then what's the point

7145.92 --> 7149.4400000000005
it's like knowing a story and then doing

7148.32 --> 7153.0
it wrong

7149.44 --> 7153.0
what's the point

7162.639 --> 7168.2390000000005
it's like yay i've i've learned to cast

7166.32 --> 7169.44
the spell it's amazing the results

7168.239 --> 7172.159
amazing

7169.44 --> 7174.239
and then you do it wrong every time then

7172.159 --> 7176.0
yeah nothing happens it's just a fizzle

7174.239 --> 7178.32
it's just a mishap nothing's gonna

7176.0 --> 7180.48
happen you did it wrong so what's the

7178.32 --> 7183.04
point of making a tradition out of doing

7180.48 --> 7184.48
it wrong what's the point

7183.04 --> 7188.4
it's no point

7184.48 --> 7188.4
you got it wrong it's a mockery

7188.96 --> 7193.28
it's a mockery you don't even realize it

7190.88 --> 7195.04
is a mockery at that point i guess and

7193.28 --> 7199.759999999999
maybe that is the point maybe that's the

7195.04 --> 7202.88
satanic point to create a mockery

7199.76 --> 7204.8
and people follow it not even realizing

7202.88 --> 7206.2390000000005
it is a mockery

7204.8 --> 7208.719
and it

7206.239 --> 7210.4
isn't what they think it is because they

7208.719 --> 7212.08
might think they're actually being

7210.4 --> 7213.36
really good christians they want to do

7212.08 --> 7216.32
that

7213.36 --> 7218.88
but they don't pay attention they don't

7216.32 --> 7221.199
actually learn the lessons

7218.88 --> 7222.159000000001
and then they just roll into the mockery

7221.199 --> 7224.159
of it

7222.159 --> 7226.638999999999
which is actually satanic even though

7224.159 --> 7228.5599999999995
they might have the best intentions

7226.639 --> 7231.76
but because they're part of the

7228.56 --> 7235.679
corruption part of the cocking

7231.76 --> 7239.360000000001
part of the propaganda influences

7235.679 --> 7241.92
yeah it is effectively satanic so in my

7239.36 --> 7243.5199999999995
opinion it's better to then just close

7241.92 --> 7245.4400000000005
the church

7243.52 --> 7247.360000000001
if you if you're going to do all the

7245.44 --> 7251.04
freaking v

7247.36 --> 7254.239
[ __ ] masks garbage

7251.04 --> 7257.679
political correctness garbage

7254.239 --> 7260.159
it's just better to just close it then

7257.679 --> 7260.159
serious

7264.639 --> 7269.28
but you're all gonna just

7266.639 --> 7271.1900000000005
sing your christmas songs in the church

7269.28 --> 7275.599
with masks on

7271.19 --> 7278.4
[Music]

7275.599 --> 7280.8
you know how [ __ ] you're gonna look

7278.4 --> 7283.199
have any idea how incredibly stupid

7280.8 --> 7286.08
you're gonna look

7283.199 --> 7287.119
like in the face of jesus

7286.08 --> 7289.28
like

7287.119 --> 7291.759999999999
why didn't you just put a mask on the

7289.28 --> 7293.119
jesus statue in the church then

7291.76 --> 7296.639
you know while you're at it why did you

7293.119 --> 7299.679
just put a mask on him

7296.639 --> 7299.679
god what am i saying

7301.76 --> 7304.159000000001
ah

7308.84 --> 7313.84
just do it the way you're supposed to do

7311.92 --> 7317.52
it ignoring

7313.84 --> 7321.4400000000005
the world ignoring what political crap

7317.52 --> 7324.320000000001
is shoveled at you what media panic

7321.44 --> 7326.159
fake fraudulent doctors are shoving

7324.32 --> 7330.239
ignore it

7326.159 --> 7330.239
it's not supposed to be trendy

7334.159 --> 7339.44
you get it christianity is not supposed

7337.36 --> 7340.48
to be trendy that was kind of the

7339.44 --> 7342.799999999999
problem

7340.48 --> 7344.799999999999
with catholicism in the first place is

7342.8 --> 7346.56
that they were always just trying to be

7344.8 --> 7347.84
trendy they were trying to be the big

7346.56 --> 7349.360000000001
guys

7347.84 --> 7352.96
the best group

7349.36 --> 7355.04
it's not you're not supposed to do that

7352.96 --> 7357.44
you're supposed to stay pure and

7355.04 --> 7360.08
uncorrupted not be

7357.44 --> 7362.719
super popular adapt assimilate

7360.08 --> 7365.719
everything just to be popular that's not

7362.719 --> 7365.719
christian

7366.4 --> 7370.96
that's the whole point of the path of

7368.4 --> 7373.28
christ is to stay pure and to not be

7370.96 --> 7377.639
corrupted by the world to not be of the

7373.28 --> 7377.639
world but within it

7382.4 --> 7385.4
so

7397.5 --> 7400.619
[Music]

7405.04 --> 7408.96
again you used to fall for you thought

7406.8 --> 7410.0
the world was a planet yeah

7408.96 --> 7412.4800000000005
of course

7410.0 --> 7415.04
well planets definitely don't belong in

7412.48 --> 7415.04
the church

7416.0 --> 7422.639
it seriously pisses me off when whenever

7418.719 --> 7424.32
i hear some like that happen even in the

7422.639 --> 7426.639
mormon church

7424.32 --> 7428.96
when i was going there that at one point

7426.639 --> 7430.639
i was hearing like oh he's gonna talk to

7428.96 --> 7435.44
the students now and he literally

7430.639 --> 7438.8
started making his own weird allegories

7435.44 --> 7440.799999999999
and he made it up i'm sure he did

7438.8 --> 7442.96
that was not from some book he just made

7440.8 --> 7445.119000000001
up stories about plan like he tried to

7442.96 --> 7445.92
make it all science about the planets

7445.119 --> 7448.88
and

7445.92 --> 7452.88
how that's still biblical it was

7448.88 --> 7454.079
like what the [ __ ] are you doing man

7452.88 --> 7457.84
like

7454.079 --> 7461.119
don't you know that's like really wrong

7457.84 --> 7461.119000000001
you shouldn't be doing that

7462.159 --> 7468.4
you should be telling them no

7465.679 --> 7470.96
the biblical cosmology does not support

7468.4 --> 7474.079
that they're wandering lights it's in

7470.96 --> 7476.0
genesis why didn't they do that

7474.079 --> 7478.32
why did they avoid that why didn't they

7476.0 --> 7479.679
just say look

7478.32 --> 7482.159
yeah we know

7479.679 --> 7483.599
schools teach that and all that

7482.159 --> 7487.92
we know

7483.599 --> 7487.92
it's on the news and in the movies

7488.0 --> 7494.56
doesn't abide by the christian cosmology

7491.679 --> 7496.56
it's not in the bible there is no hint

7494.56 --> 7498.56
of any of that

7496.56 --> 7500.320000000001
and wandering lights why didn't they

7498.56 --> 7502.320000000001
just do that

7500.32 --> 7504.079
you should be doing that christians

7502.32 --> 7506.799999999999
should be doing that

7504.079 --> 7509.04
i mean you're not supposed to like

7506.8 --> 7510.079000000001
did you remember that space is fake like

7509.04 --> 7512.719
that's not

7510.079 --> 7514.4
typical in a church right but if someone

7512.719 --> 7516.4800000000005
is gonna ask

7514.4 --> 7519.48
then you gotta kind of be honest about

7516.48 --> 7519.48
it

7520.239 --> 7523.4
you know

7542.56 --> 7545.56
so

7548.079 --> 7551.36
forgive them for they known and what

7549.599 --> 7554.0
they did

7551.36 --> 7557.119
well they should know if you are

7554.0 --> 7559.36
like some kind of a figure in the church

7557.119 --> 7564.159
in your church that's prominent that has

7559.36 --> 7564.159
a authority position spiritually

7564.96 --> 7570.96
then you can't be weak you can't be just

7568.56 --> 7574.320000000001
pulled

7570.96 --> 7575.76
out and be all popular wise and like oh

7574.32 --> 7577.84
i know

7575.76 --> 7579.4400000000005
i know everything about space

7577.84 --> 7580.96
no

7579.44 --> 7584.159
you're a spiritual leader you're

7580.96 --> 7585.199
supposed to make people aware

7584.159 --> 7587.04
of the

7585.199 --> 7590.638999999999
illusions

7587.04 --> 7591.76
versus the known confirmable truth and

7590.639 --> 7594.0
all that

7591.76 --> 7596.56
right

7594.0 --> 7599.04
spiritual anchor

7596.56 --> 7600.159000000001
a touchdown point

7599.04 --> 7603.679
a

7600.159 --> 7605.759999999999
a root system a earthing

7603.679 --> 7608.2390000000005
they need to know

7605.76 --> 7612.0
what is real and they need to especially

7608.239 --> 7614.0
know that you you can be dependent upon

7612.0 --> 7616.639
to know what is real

7614.0 --> 7618.4
if they might get confused right because

7616.639 --> 7620.159000000001
people do get confused and then they

7618.4 --> 7621.92
need

7620.159 --> 7624.0
a lot of them need like oh i need

7621.92 --> 7625.599
somebody like smart to help me out i

7624.0 --> 7628.8
need to figure this out

7625.599 --> 7630.8
that's what a church leader is supposed

7628.8 --> 7633.04
to do that's what a community leader is

7630.8 --> 7634.2390000000005
supposed to do

7633.04 --> 7636.0
to be

7634.239 --> 7638.159
that person that really

7636.0 --> 7640.639
that can really distinguish can work

7638.159 --> 7641.679
with somebody's dreams

7640.639 --> 7643.679
right

7641.679 --> 7645.599
i mean

7643.679 --> 7647.599
that's just a rough example of someone

7645.599 --> 7650.079
who's like really into power rangers or

7647.599 --> 7652.96
something and they keep on drawing power

7650.079 --> 7653.92
rangers yeah you know it's ridiculous tv

7652.96 --> 7655.28
[ __ ]

7653.92 --> 7657.1990000000005
but you're not gonna be like how dare

7655.28 --> 7658.719
you don't you freaking talk about the

7657.199 --> 7660.799999999999
power range because they're in that

7658.719 --> 7664.32
dream right then right so you're not

7660.8 --> 7667.04
gonna don't try to take the dream away

7664.32 --> 7668.5599999999995
but do try to make them aware that it is

7667.04 --> 7671.36
a dream

7668.56 --> 7674.719
it's all passing and that there are more

7671.36 --> 7677.04
important more timeless things

7674.719 --> 7679.44
that you can give them a hint of and

7677.04 --> 7682.079
then in the moment they might not even

7679.44 --> 7684.079
be all that interested or it might be

7682.079 --> 7685.199
like oh it's too much

7684.079 --> 7687.679
but

7685.199 --> 7689.44
if you share it and you don't let that

7687.679 --> 7691.4400000000005
i don't want it right now if you don't

7689.44 --> 7693.119
let that deter you

7691.44 --> 7695.04
and you can give them something that

7693.119 --> 7697.199
maybe they can't even handle in that

7695.04 --> 7699.199
moment and they won't even give you any

7697.199 --> 7702.239
compliments or whatever

7699.199 --> 7704.079
but they might remember

7702.239 --> 7705.919999999999
and then at some point they will be

7704.079 --> 7708.639
ready and then suddenly what you said

7705.92 --> 7711.04
becomes very valuable it's just not

7708.639 --> 7714.4800000000005
immediately it takes some time

7711.04 --> 7716.56
it's part of being a spiritual leader

7714.48 --> 7719.199
which is what people

7716.56 --> 7720.96
that lead church communities should be

7719.199 --> 7723.5199999999995
doing

7720.96 --> 7725.119
not to be all popular oh look at the new

7723.52 --> 7726.400000000001
trendiness oh we're going to be so

7725.119 --> 7729.44
trendy no

7726.4 --> 7732.799999999999
that's diametrically opposed to what a

7729.44 --> 7732.799999999999
church leader should be doing

7734.8 --> 7738.28
in my opinion

7756.639 --> 7762.400000000001
to blame other adults not children yeah

7759.52 --> 7766.2390000000005
good point rasta

7762.4 --> 7766.239
take it easy on the caps by the way

7768.719 --> 7771.92
oh time to split all right guns i've

7770.4 --> 7774.239
never run thanks for popping by thanks

7771.92 --> 7775.4400000000005
for the paypal and merry christmas to

7774.239 --> 7776.799999999999
you

7775.44 --> 7778.0
i think i'm probably going to round out

7776.8 --> 7780.56
the show too

7778.0 --> 7782.0
whoa man what i've been going over two

7780.56 --> 7787.159000000001
hours

7782.0 --> 7787.159
it's what it's dark when did that happen

7787.199 --> 7789.839999999999
what happened

7790.079 --> 7794.48
it was just light

7792.48 --> 7798.718999999999
i guess i got caught talking and

7794.48 --> 7802.99
suddenly blink and now it's evening okay

7798.719 --> 7806.1
that was quick look see

7802.99 --> 7806.099999999999
[Music]

7809.44 --> 7812.919999999999
blue color

7822.96 --> 7826.76
oh man i'm getting hungry

7838.079 --> 7845.119
yeah merry christmas 101 rock hard

7842.239 --> 7845.119
and everybody

7847.04 --> 7851.84
this time flies insects yeah yeah yeah

7849.679 --> 7854.159
also lots of insect kind of weird for

7851.84 --> 7857.4400000000005
christmas but i guess

7854.159 --> 7861.44
it's all relevant right it's good to

7857.44 --> 7861.44
know everything about the world

7862.48 --> 7869.04
that yeah we share existence with to

7865.28 --> 7872.239
understand it know what it's doing there

7869.04 --> 7873.92
so that you don't fear it

7872.239 --> 7876.5599999999995
and that you might even learn to

7873.92 --> 7878.4
appreciate it somewhat

7876.56 --> 7882.0
like for example i freaking

7878.4 --> 7883.04
instinctively hate mosquitoes right

7882.0 --> 7884.4
but

7883.04 --> 7886.88
i realize

7884.4 --> 7889.5199999999995
that they're very important

7886.88 --> 7891.119
like for the food cycle out there

7889.52 --> 7893.119000000001
it's important they exist there's a

7891.119 --> 7895.28
whole bunch of creatures that depend on

7893.119 --> 7895.28
them

7896.0 --> 7900.96
and like

7897.36 --> 7903.44
that goes very far it's like mosquitoes

7900.96 --> 7903.44
are like

7904.48 --> 7908.718999999999
mosquitoes are to nature

7907.199 --> 7912.5599999999995
like

7908.719 --> 7914.2390000000005
roughly what rice is

7912.56 --> 7917.280000000001
to asians

7914.239 --> 7920.48
right it's like yeah

7917.28 --> 7922.239
it ties into a lot

7920.48 --> 7923.5199999999995
and though even though i freaking hate

7922.239 --> 7926.239
mosquitoes

7923.52 --> 7928.159000000001
i do realize yeah they exist for a

7926.239 --> 7930.0
purpose and you can't just take them

7928.159 --> 7932.159
away that would

7930.0 --> 7935.36
do a lot of damage

7932.159 --> 7935.36
more than you could oversee

7937.92 --> 7942.88
mosquitoes are for population what are

7940.079 --> 7945.5199999999995
you talking about

7942.88 --> 7945.52
no they're not

7948.32 --> 7953.759999999999
there's their mosquitoes are like the

7950.48 --> 7956.638999999999
rice of insects

7953.76 --> 7962.079000000001
they're flying food

7956.639 --> 7965.1990000000005
they're like protein transport systems

7962.079 --> 7965.199
mosquitoes make

7965.76 --> 7969.84
makes blood go around you could say

7975.599 --> 7980.52
anyway

7976.56 --> 7980.52
still don't like him though

7984.56 --> 7988.96
right i don't kill creatures not even

7987.04 --> 7991.44
insects but yeah mosquitoes are still

7988.96 --> 7994.159
the exemption not retracting that

7991.44 --> 7994.159
screw them

7995.52 --> 7997.84
uh

7998.159 --> 8002.4
they spread disease

8000.56 --> 8006.2390000000005
not really

8002.4 --> 8006.239
i mean certain mosquitoes do

8008.48 --> 8012.959999999999
although yeah that's very treatable

8010.719 --> 8012.96
though

8015.76 --> 8021.119000000001
i mean there's no like like malaria is

8018.8 --> 8025.84
very treatable you understand it's a

8021.119 --> 8025.839999999999
parasite parasites are very treatable

8031.119 --> 8036.4
that's part of what they are for oh

8033.679 --> 8038.96
really you got any ancient historical

8036.4 --> 8042.119
quotations

8038.96 --> 8042.119
for that

8064.96 --> 8071.199
yeah yes kefla yeah me too yeah nathan's

8068.48 --> 8073.44
clover's doing great

8071.199 --> 8074.719
yeah

8073.44 --> 8077.36
yeah the second

8074.719 --> 8077.36
video was

8077.84 --> 8083.599
all is good and yeah that was a very

8080.56 --> 8085.599
relieving video and very cute

8083.599 --> 8088.599
right i guess i'm gonna round out the

8085.599 --> 8088.599
show

8095.599 --> 8099.76
not treatable in animal population

8102.4 --> 8106.48
i don't know

8103.76 --> 8107.280000000001
i don't know godzilla i don't know

8106.48 --> 8109.919999999999
like

8107.28 --> 8112.4
how that works with animal life in

8109.92 --> 8115.119
africa and all that

8112.4 --> 8118.32
i don't i don't know if the malaria

8115.119 --> 8118.32
parasite is even

8118.88 --> 8124.719
like harmful to every sort of creature i

8122.079 --> 8125.679
don't know about that i haven't dug that

8124.719 --> 8128.159
deep

8125.679 --> 8129.92
into the info

8128.159 --> 8134.679
i don't know what it is i don't know

8129.92 --> 8134.679
where the malaria parasite came from

8137.76 --> 8142.96
and it's kind of odd you know like how

8139.52 --> 8142.96
did it sneak in there

8144.079 --> 8148.48
because it's not like it keeps on

8146.32 --> 8150.88
carrying on from generation to

8148.48 --> 8152.718999999999
generation

8150.88 --> 8156.2390000000005
through touch or something no it's

8152.719 --> 8159.04
literally they're born with it it's

8156.239 --> 8162.4
integrated it's weird

8159.04 --> 8164.639
i don't know how that's possible

8162.4 --> 8166.96
part of the no but you how do you know

8164.639 --> 8170.159000000001
that courts how do you know it's part of

8166.96 --> 8171.679
their purpose what you're conjuring like

8170.159 --> 8173.839999999999
the design

8171.679 --> 8174.639
its population control

8173.84 --> 8176.2390000000005
no

8174.639 --> 8179.28
unless

8176.239 --> 8182.879999999999
you start to assume that everything

8179.28 --> 8184.96
nature does is all and only about

8182.88 --> 8187.36
population control all creatures

8184.96 --> 8189.36
everything they exist to be population

8187.36 --> 8190.839999999999
control of everything else

8189.36 --> 8194.639
right unless you're going to go with

8190.84 --> 8196.8
that you know

8194.639 --> 8196.8
no

8199.84 --> 8207.08
like mosquitoes don't devastate nature

8203.359 --> 8207.08
they don't do that

8207.12 --> 8212.719000000001
i mean yeah swamp areas

8209.599 --> 8214.319
swamp yeah but creatures then

8212.719 --> 8217.358999999999
also certain type of creatures that are

8214.319 --> 8220.479
bothered but that they avoid the swamps

8217.359 --> 8223.92
they go to other places

8220.479 --> 8226.8
where there's not so much mosquitoes so

8223.92 --> 8229.76
it's just to say oh they're bred only

8226.8 --> 8233.438999999998
for population control oh really

8229.76 --> 8235.2
so that's your interpretation of god how

8233.439 --> 8237.92
he designed it

8235.2 --> 8240.559000000001
when he he created all the creatures i

8237.92 --> 8240.559
don't think so

8243.76 --> 8248.08
but i don't know maybe there is

8245.599 --> 8249.599
something weird about like malaria

8248.08 --> 8252.96
mosquitoes

8249.599 --> 8256.2
maybe they have been modified like what

8252.96 --> 8259.598999999998
if during the

8256.2 --> 8259.599
pre-atlantean age

8260.08 --> 8265.359
you know when when the nephilim went all

8262.88 --> 8269.518999999998
full genetic modification and freaky

8265.359 --> 8269.519
[ __ ] yeah maybe it was made then

8269.679 --> 8273.28
something maybe it's not really an

8271.519 --> 8276.399
original design

8273.28 --> 8280.559000000001
of of the mosquito that could be but to

8276.399 --> 8283.358999999999
say mosquito in general is designed by

8280.559 --> 8285.759999999998
like original gods to be population

8283.359 --> 8287.2
control no that's

8285.76 --> 8291.800000000001
i don't see that

8287.2 --> 8291.800000000001
like no creatures are like that

8295.12 --> 8299.439
read a little too much into but you know

8296.88 --> 8302.639
i always do that

8299.439 --> 8306.319
i take a remark like i just take

8302.639 --> 8308.0
separated remarks very serious

8306.319 --> 8310.16
and i felt like

8308.0 --> 8312.719
you just said population control and i'm

8310.16 --> 8315.28
just like no

8312.719 --> 8317.839999999998
no unless you look at everything like

8315.28 --> 8320.24
from a darwinian perspective

8317.84 --> 8323.599
and then just like yeah then everything

8320.24 --> 8325.84
becomes population it's nature right

8323.599 --> 8327.2
nature always grows out of control until

8325.84 --> 8328.8
something else

8327.2 --> 8330.960000000001
controls it

8328.8 --> 8333.84
is that population control yeah well

8330.96 --> 8334.719
then everything all forms of life are

8333.84 --> 8336.639000000001
all

8334.719 --> 8340.16
designed to be population control

8336.639 --> 8340.16
because that's a part of nature

8342.559 --> 8347.84
right including humans

8344.719 --> 8347.839999999998
including everything

8349.12 --> 8354.240000000002
but yeah i know yeah i i zoomed in a

8352.08 --> 8355.92
little too much

8354.24 --> 8358.24
but you know sometimes

8355.92 --> 8359.679
people say something they don't mean all

8358.24 --> 8362.96
that much with it

8359.679 --> 8366.08
but i'm still gonna take it as a lot

8362.96 --> 8367.199999999999
because i find it worth addressing

8366.08 --> 8369.84
even though

8367.2 --> 8373.04
i basically over exaggerate the original

8369.84 --> 8376.719000000001
statement it's something i do i yeah

8373.04 --> 8379.519
it's kind of become a bit of a habit

8376.719 --> 8380.96
because it's me talking

8379.519 --> 8383.359
on my show

8380.96 --> 8385.759999999998
and then doing that really provides you

8383.359 --> 8386.84
a whole reason to start

8385.76 --> 8389.76
explaining

8386.84 --> 8392.479
stuff so i kind of do that don't take it

8389.76 --> 8392.479
too personal

8393.2 --> 8397.359
disease is natural population control

8398.24 --> 8403.16
spreads

8400.16 --> 8403.16
no

8406.96 --> 8412.08
now disease is a part

8409.28 --> 8412.08
of nature

8412.399 --> 8416.56
it's a part of the designs it's a part

8414.88 --> 8418.64
of it

8416.56 --> 8421.76
so again you come down to the same thing

8418.64 --> 8423.439
oh it's control yeah everything is

8421.76 --> 8425.439
cells

8423.439 --> 8428.0
are population control

8425.439 --> 8430.56
every cell is population control it's

8428.0 --> 8432.64
all designed

8430.56 --> 8434.319
as population control

8432.64 --> 8435.199999999999
but as soon as you start pointing at

8434.319 --> 8437.439
this

8435.2 --> 8438.16
was the zionist population yeah then you

8437.439 --> 8440.399
go

8438.16 --> 8441.52
eventually like yeah everything is

8440.399 --> 8445.039999999999
everything

8441.52 --> 8446.08
it's all population control then

8445.04 --> 8449.84
or

8446.08 --> 8449.84
it's just a mechanism

8450.0 --> 8455.439
and to think about it

8451.92 --> 8457.52
to be to reduce any form of life only to

8455.439 --> 8458.800000000001
that mechanism that is a part of all

8457.52 --> 8462.08
nature

8458.8 --> 8464.8
seems kind of degrading

8462.08 --> 8466.479
there's more to it

8464.8 --> 8467.358999999999
god designs

8466.479 --> 8471.119999999999
things

8467.359 --> 8474.960000000001
more than just to be population control

8471.12 --> 8474.960000000001
everything has like a purpose

8476.96 --> 8481.839999999998
that's more than just basic mechanical

8479.68 --> 8484.16
function

8481.84 --> 8488.24
right anyway

8484.16 --> 8488.24
i think i've overblown it enough by now

8494.399 --> 8499.039999999999
ah oh there you go 101 rock on yeah

8496.96 --> 8500.72
that's just nature

8499.04 --> 8502.880000000001
yeah if rabbits

8500.72 --> 8505.039999999999
go like uh

8502.88 --> 8507.199999999999
start exploding over the place then yeah

8505.04 --> 8509.76
all the hunting animals they're gonna

8507.2 --> 8512.84
have a good time

8509.76 --> 8515.76
until yeah that population is

8512.84 --> 8517.439
suddenly yeah at its minimum and then

8515.76 --> 8519.28
yeah they're not gonna have a good time

8517.439 --> 8520.399
because suddenly now their prey is all

8519.28 --> 8522.960000000001
gone

8520.399 --> 8522.96
that's right

8524.8 --> 8528.8
anyway i am rounding out now for

8526.72 --> 8529.92
realsies

8528.8 --> 8531.84
it's

8529.92 --> 8536.08
two hours 20 minutes this is one of my

8531.84 --> 8536.08
longest shows yet and it started so late

8536.319 --> 8541.6
anyway

8538.64 --> 8544.319
thanks everyone for coming for this late

8541.6 --> 8547.12
but extra long christmas

8544.319 --> 8547.96
episode of flat earth early bird

8547.12 --> 8550.800000000001
number

8547.96 --> 8551.599999999999
1111 it's kind of a magical number i

8550.8 --> 8553.679999999998
thought

8551.6 --> 8556.399000000001
so yeah it's worth it

8553.68 --> 8558.08
doing it two hours 22 minutes

8556.399 --> 8560.88
worth it too

8558.08 --> 8562.8
right so if you like this show

8560.88 --> 8564.88
then please don't forget to rogan's it

8562.8 --> 8566.0
up and if you haven't already subscribe
