5.38 --> 13.34
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

9.17 --> 19.659
early-bird number 85 I'm your host

13.34 --> 23.21
Arwen and forgot little light in here

19.659 --> 27.46
yeah whatever ice and snow is out there

23.21 --> 27.46
it's all gone just completely vanished

30.579 --> 39.039
still kind of rainy and Misty and try to

36.109 --> 41.690000000000005
know it's always something isn't it

39.039 --> 43.910000000000004
there I complain about the cold or I

41.69 --> 50.05
complain about the weather it's too hot

43.91 --> 50.05
or something must be my Dutch heritage

51.19 --> 56.07
but

53.469 --> 56.07
yeah

57.76 --> 66.25
I'm doing a lot better but different

62.88 --> 71.17
very different very very different a

66.25 --> 73.68
very weird way it's like the shivers

71.17 --> 73.68
have stopped

77.57 --> 84.61999999999999
it's just from what it's like it's

79.9 --> 86.96000000000001
turned around it's the same but now it's

84.62 --> 91.24000000000001
coming from another direction it's it's

86.96 --> 96.16999999999999
very hard to explain like my sensations

91.24 --> 101.69
that sense but yeah I'm I need to pull

96.17 --> 104.27
myself together literally and I've been

101.69 --> 108.55
taking up some of ISA advising base

104.27 --> 111.77
we've started to push ups and [ __ ] and

108.55 --> 114.67
maybe yeah maybe the spring time is

111.77 --> 119.09
coming and I should kind of look at that

114.67 --> 123.28
like yeah it is coming and I will do a

119.09 --> 123.28
lot better once that happens

126.56 --> 134.81
but yeah let's see some chat Steve and

131.51 --> 136.60999999999999
Nick ATM The Observer

134.81 --> 139.66
I got Wells good to see you avoiding

136.61 --> 139.66000000000003
each edge am

142.709 --> 148.56900000000002
yeah

145.24 --> 150.70000000000002
it's so weird it's like

148.569 --> 152.79899999999998
thanks as we call me yeah it's so

150.7 --> 158.54899999999998
different now everything is so different

152.799 --> 158.549
like everything that's happened it just

162.45 --> 165.98999999999998
just look at me a week ago what was I

165.48 --> 168.23899999999998
doing

165.99 --> 170.73000000000002
it's so different now I feel different

168.239 --> 171.45000000000002
it's almost like I'm not the same person

170.73 --> 175.59
anymore

171.45 --> 180.08999999999997
I am but things just work differently

175.59 --> 182.66
and I had a very strong effect in that

180.09 --> 185.58
sense yesterday evening

182.66 --> 188.19
talked very extensively with Constance

185.58 --> 191.88000000000002
it was always such a great support for

188.19 --> 194.04
me it's you guys have experienced out

191.88 --> 197.069
there even when she's on the hangout

194.04 --> 198.84
she's so understanding and other people

197.069 --> 203.63
too and I want to thank you all for

198.84 --> 206.31
being incredibly supportive and

203.63 --> 214.59
mustering this wisdom that just inspires

206.31 --> 221.04
all to me and it's when that happens it

214.59 --> 224.97
feels the same as when I do it but from

221.04 --> 227.69
the other side it's I wonder sometimes

224.97 --> 232.579
is all that knowledge all that wisdom

227.69 --> 236.37
really ours is it or does it just

232.579 --> 241.37
channel through those that don't have

236.37 --> 241.37
the obstructions to the blocking

247.22 --> 252.89
just gives a whole new perspective on

249.5 --> 254.93
what consciousness is and humanity is

252.89 --> 260.0
and what individuals really are

254.93 --> 263.89
sometimes I wonder like is the sense of

260.0 --> 269.48
being an individual really an illusion a

263.89 --> 272.53
very core foundation Oh illusion and

269.48 --> 277.25
that's yeah not that I suggest that you

272.53 --> 279.91999999999996
give it up like no way because what's

277.25 --> 282.35
the point of it all if you're not gonna

279.92 --> 288.44
be this individual that you've been

282.35 --> 290.39000000000004
shaped into no but when you look at the

288.44 --> 294.56
energies and the threads and the

290.39 --> 301.07
frequencies it just seems like are we

294.56 --> 303.2
really that separate but just all a

301.07 --> 310.15999999999997
bunch of parallel strings on the same

303.2 --> 315.68
guitar and some strings are just not

310.16 --> 318.65000000000003
we're broken or not tights well enough

315.68 --> 321.41
so they just don't work and others work

318.65 --> 323.98999999999995
perfectly they're tuned perfectly is

321.41 --> 331.84000000000003
that is that it in any way very ethereal

323.99 --> 331.84000000000003
stuff again I guess I guess what

332.97 --> 338.1
yeah the whole thing is not over yet

336.03 --> 342.63
not by a long shot and I've been

338.1 --> 346.98
presented by my friends here in the

342.63 --> 352.40999999999997
community with challenges they're

346.98 --> 356.91
basically telling me like yeah there's

352.41 --> 362.64000000000004
more and yeah I'm noticing there is more

356.91 --> 366.27000000000004
there is so much more it's like how much

362.64 --> 368.66999999999996
can an individual take really and maybe

366.27 --> 370.62
that is just the challenge maybe that is

368.67 --> 374.97
the greatest challenge how much can we

370.62 --> 381.99
take how much can we allow ourselves to

374.97 --> 386.67
see but for example I'll give you a very

381.99 --> 388.95
odd example that I just saw not even 50

386.67 --> 395.01
minutes before that and it freaked me

388.95 --> 397.34999999999997
out it just did it's a video from

395.01 --> 400.53
observation deck and yeah it's actually

397.35 --> 402.98
YouTube that suggested so I don't know

400.53 --> 406.38
what's going on with you two

402.98 --> 411.20000000000005
what is this what is the algorithm doing

406.38 --> 411.2
it it's so contradicting everything

414.61 --> 421.71000000000004
it's doing one thing to one group and

417.639 --> 421.71000000000004
another thing to other groups

424.4 --> 431.5
and I get the feeling I get the feeling

427.91 --> 434.6
this strong feeling that the algorithm

431.5 --> 436.58
yes many times has been suggested is

434.6 --> 441.08000000000004
basically the spirit of Lucifer or

436.58 --> 445.19
something is trying to manipulate and go

441.08 --> 448.65999999999997
to everyone all things in the world

445.19 --> 453.29
trying to goad it into a direction and

448.66 --> 456.5
maneuvering contrasts make forcing

453.29 --> 461.27000000000004
choices until there are absolute

456.5 --> 463.94
polarized fronts and I'm getting this

461.27 --> 466.37
feeling more and more it is very freaky

463.94 --> 468.289
because yeah that's not what I want I

466.37 --> 471.71
want everyone to come together I want

468.289 --> 474.789
everyone to get an understanding and not

471.71 --> 474.789
to polarize

477.42 --> 485.31
and Danny yeah a depth response with

480.5 --> 490.86
debt that far stepping back question

485.31 --> 497.19
like we kind of know that everything is

490.86 --> 500.06
a lie but do we realize that everything

497.19 --> 504.03
is a lie you know

500.06 --> 508.59
how far can we realize this really

504.03 --> 516.8
without losing everything or losing it

508.59 --> 516.8
or losing ourselves and it's like

521.53 --> 528.28
what out there is real and what is a

524.02 --> 531.46
game and do the ones that are in the

528.28 --> 535.12
game even know they're in a game being

531.46 --> 543.34
played with them how many people out

535.12 --> 546.43
there know they are pawns in a game can

543.34 --> 553.0
they see it and if they see it do they

546.43 --> 555.15
choose it and I find myself more and

553.0 --> 562.87
more looking into people's eyes

555.15 --> 564.73
everywhere shows news videos as soon as

562.87 --> 566.68
somebody is really there doing a

564.73 --> 569.47
presentation or something I look in

566.68 --> 572.14
their eyes and just see what what are

569.47 --> 574.0
they carrying there what is their

572.14 --> 576.88
sensation do they think they're doing

574.0 --> 579.16
alright do they think they're doing

576.88 --> 582.4
something they have to do are they

579.16 --> 584.29
afraid are they suffering are they

582.4 --> 586.72
holding something back and it's just

584.29 --> 589.63
almost the only thing that I end up

586.72 --> 592.0
looking at really because it seems more

589.63 --> 595.08
like the eyes communicate the truth and

592.0 --> 595.08
the words do not

599.53 --> 604.0
this world is just weird anyway I'm

601.96 --> 606.97
gonna get to that example that I was

604.0 --> 610.09
mentioning about a video from

606.97 --> 614.62
observation deck let me see if I could

610.09 --> 618.01
present that just one part all of it is

614.62 --> 621.97
good it is kind of a a continuation of

618.01 --> 625.3
the Phoenicians versus the Tarte Aryans

621.97 --> 627.61
concept it's made by somebody else I

625.3 --> 634.03
think that maybe even Martin mentioned

627.61 --> 637.6800000000001
this this very video but I'm gonna see

634.03 --> 637.68
if I can prevail them

639.57 --> 642.57
see

646.74 --> 654.6
and I'm not gonna do it with volume I'm

650.31 --> 658.38
just gonna show you something that

654.6 --> 663.3000000000001
shocked me actually apparently there's

658.38 --> 665.55
this spot the it's it's set by the video

663.3 --> 668.8499999999999
maker it's in in like in Russia in the

665.55 --> 677.0999999999999
sea and they found this underwater

668.85 --> 679.11
a typical seamless rock thing so yeah

677.1 --> 681.09
it's like a the Sun looks familiar you

679.11 --> 686.16
know that's kind of interesting yeah

681.09 --> 694.32
that's very typical well guess what that

686.16 --> 697.38
rock formation is exactly exactly like

694.32 --> 702.4300000000001
laser printed exactly the same with all

697.38 --> 705.08
details all bumps and shitty thing is as

702.43 --> 708.3299999999999
[Music]

705.08 --> 712.5300000000001
as here in another part of the world

708.33 --> 718.62
it's like it's been copy pasted what the

712.53 --> 721.0799999999999
hell what is this this is this is more

718.62 --> 725.45
than just a construction technique

721.08 --> 725.45
there's something really weird going on

725.84 --> 734.52
it's it freaks me out

729.66 --> 736.92
really does and yeah it's very easy to

734.52 --> 739.74
draw extreme conclusions it's all a

736.92 --> 743.99
simulation it's all the illusion is it's

739.74 --> 747.78
magic it's just Satan copy pasting [ __ ]

743.99 --> 752.27
maybe it is I don't get it

747.78 --> 758.0699999999999
it's so weird it is so incredibly weird

752.27 --> 760.77
can you see it it's this is not an error

758.07 --> 766.0400000000001
it's the exact same thing in another

760.77 --> 766.04
place in the world what the Freak

770.43 --> 775.55
yeah so that came on my plate I don't

773.25 --> 775.55
know where

782.1 --> 786.72
but yeah

783.87 --> 792.8
see there's copy-pasted constructions in

786.72 --> 792.8000000000001
this world is it fake really

795.85 --> 801.25
he pretty much just did a Photoshop

798.16 --> 804.4599999999999
overlay of it and it's definitely a

801.25 --> 809.61
different place you know it's a moving

804.46 --> 809.61
underwater video so

815.22 --> 821.5500000000001
it's like every time I keep keep on

818.79 --> 826.65
looking things become crazier and

821.55 --> 829.55
crazier and more polarized and more

826.65 --> 829.55
extreme

836.32 --> 843.82
and at the same time from all the people

839.05 --> 849.2199999999999
all my friends people that care resonate

843.82 --> 852.639
with me they emphasize like the the

849.22 --> 856.75
Christ's wisdom to me and that really

852.639 --> 863.069
kind of says like yeah it's it is all an

856.75 --> 863.069
illusion it is all a giant lesson

867.81 --> 878.51
to test us before we move on before we

874.14 --> 878.51
move on beyond this world and

885.25 --> 889.269
and it's odd because they remind me you

888.1 --> 891.4590000000001
should rejoice

889.269 --> 897.43
you should rejoice in seeing all this

891.459 --> 901.8889999999999
and to be fair it's it's tough I want to

897.43 --> 901.8889999999999
write but

903.6 --> 910.95
it's so shocking in a way and I get this

908.55 --> 914.55
weird response that's probably routed

910.95 --> 917.4300000000001
into when my awareness first grabbed

914.55 --> 920.31
onto this concept all of this when I was

917.43 --> 929.04
a very little kid and that is like this

920.31 --> 936.81
can't be like no way how can I know this

929.04 --> 942.18
is true and not and not believe it yeah

936.81 --> 946.6199999999999
well I'm not the only one apparently so

942.18 --> 951.54
there's humanity is filled with

946.62 --> 953.8100000000001
illusions and in abilities to cope with

951.54 --> 957.3299999999999
what they know to be true

953.81 --> 958.8
basically they hide what they know to be

957.33 --> 964.9100000000001
true again the holes in the

958.8 --> 964.91
consciousness effect it is everywhere

966.75 --> 976.04
and then I wonder through the philosophy

972.649 --> 980.699
is the holes

976.04 --> 984.569
what really makes all things without the

980.699 --> 986.279
holes is there anything there was no the

984.569 --> 988.709
loose you know park you could move

986.279 --> 990.11
beyond would there be anything anything

988.709 --> 994.4899999999999
at all

990.11 --> 997.8000000000001
but yeah that's really heavy philosophy

994.49 --> 1006.97
concept and yeah there's no real way to

997.8 --> 1010.8499999999999
find out at least not until we move on

1006.97 --> 1016.5690000000001
to wherever it is that we do move on

1010.85 --> 1016.5690000000001
then is that heaven

1016.67 --> 1019.5999999999999
or is it a

1020.88 --> 1028.65
new challenge in another setting and

1024.62 --> 1033.9899999999998
then this is also kind of a a belief a

1028.65 --> 1036.63
story that was shared with me a view of

1033.99 --> 1039.569
things that yeah there is another world

1036.63 --> 1042.5100000000002
beyond death you move to the next world

1039.569 --> 1045.4189999999999
kind of thing and has even been movies

1042.51 --> 1049.559
that had that kind of concept in them

1045.419 --> 1052.3200000000002
they were pretty grim but fascinating to

1049.559 --> 1057.6499999999999
know and to me is like oh my god there's

1052.32 --> 1061.95
is this really a just one part in a huge

1057.65 --> 1064.0800000000002
cascade of different levels and I've

1061.95 --> 1066.419
heard this from many angles like even

1064.08 --> 1070.9399999999998
even Alex Jones in one of his more

1066.419 --> 1073.039
visionary things said that it's like

1070.94 --> 1075.8700000000001
fascinating you know it's like

1073.039 --> 1079.11
technically who needs the damn outer

1075.87 --> 1082.02
space who needs to go to planets in this

1079.11 --> 1086.4599999999998
physical realm when the interdimensional

1082.02 --> 1091.1689999999999
world and this journey of these of the

1086.46 --> 1093.33
individual spirit is probably more than

1091.169 --> 1098.63
most can handle and that's what keeps us

1093.33 --> 1098.6299999999999
stuck here really

1113.6 --> 1117.9399999999998
yeah

1115.16 --> 1117.94
Oh them

1117.96 --> 1121.79
I want to make a special shout out

1124.33 --> 1130.73
because

1126.019 --> 1136.379
yesterday I got another PayPal donation

1130.73 --> 1143.909
pretty big not huge but yeah big enough

1136.379 --> 1147.799
for me again from the was it all done

1143.909 --> 1147.7990000000002
let me go there

1156.57 --> 1164.01
yeah from dan Kinser again thank you dan

1160.41 --> 1170.3400000000001
Kinser thank you so much yeah you great

1164.01 --> 1174.99
the 42 bucks that's that's really a lot

1170.34 --> 1181.23
thank you so much it does help it will

1174.99 --> 1187.86
help and I'll do my best to justify it

1181.23 --> 1191.55
to to really I guess yeah just see

1187.86 --> 1197.2199999999998
trying to justify it the best I can and

1191.55 --> 1200.22
not disappoint anyone and yeah I have

1197.22 --> 1204.8700000000001
definitely been considering like sister

1200.22 --> 1207.48
where do I go after this crazy rage

1204.87 --> 1212.4899999999998
thing that's starting to leave you live

1207.48 --> 1216.68
a life of its own it's just there's some

1212.49 --> 1220.22
crazy [ __ ] going on out there people are

1216.68 --> 1220.22
it's weird

1236.38 --> 1239.97
what's going on here chef

1245.6 --> 1253.98
yeah

1247.68 --> 1257.5700000000002
move on kinda need to move on but just

1253.98 --> 1257.57
looking it's like

1269.33 --> 1278.539
it's it this is all getting super super

1272.69 --> 1280.999
meta in retrospect but it's becoming the

1278.539 --> 1284.299
deeper you look and the bigger the over

1280.999 --> 1287.6000000000001
structure becomes okay the more

1284.299 --> 1290.509
difficult it becomes to find some kind

1287.6 --> 1292.789
of sensible angle to explain it with and

1290.509 --> 1295.789
that's what causes these great pauses

1292.789 --> 1300.71
every time it's just like how the hell

1295.789 --> 1303.139
am I gonna explain this and that it's

1300.71 --> 1308.57
becoming less of a consistent picture

1303.139 --> 1309.879
and more like a weird 3d blend of all

1308.57 --> 1316.519
these things

1309.879 --> 1320.529
it's becoming so complex in a way yet

1316.519 --> 1325.1
from another angle it seems to get more

1320.529 --> 1331.869
more narrow more straightforward at the

1325.1 --> 1331.869
same time but in a way that seems just

1348.37 --> 1353.32
I don't know I guess I'm gonna have to

1351.01 --> 1355.99
keep on asking am i doing the right

1353.32 --> 1360.97
thing here am i is this what I'm

1355.99 --> 1363.91
supposed to be doing so it was a good

1360.97 --> 1365.26
question to ask you know like what are

1363.91 --> 1369.96
you doing what are you doing in your

1365.26 --> 1372.19
life is this you have to you know you

1369.96 --> 1374.83
everybody's always concerned and just

1372.19 --> 1377.53
keep on going just keep that flow going

1374.83 --> 1381.9399999999998
you know keep the economy going keep

1377.53 --> 1385.83
work going but is this is that path

1381.94 --> 1385.8300000000002
really what you're supposed to be doing

1390.92 --> 1398.76
or are there

1393.51 --> 1402.51
better ways more worthy ways and not

1398.76 --> 1404.789
just for you you know it and most people

1402.51 --> 1407.01
that are on a path that is very strict

1404.789 --> 1413.639
in their own way they already know it's

1407.01 --> 1417.4089999999999
like egotism and selflessness are just

1413.639 --> 1420.99
two sides of the same metal in a way and

1417.409 --> 1426.6200000000001
those that need to do things for the

1420.99 --> 1431.07
world they meet they can't be selfish

1426.62 --> 1435.809
just like really selfish people can't

1431.07 --> 1439.889
get themselves to become selfless it's

1435.809 --> 1442.2
so weird it's just that movement in a

1439.889 --> 1446.1299999999999
direction it's like a polarization in

1442.2 --> 1449.419
either direction and they it can freeze

1446.13 --> 1449.419
it can't really stop

1459.28 --> 1464.79
yeah I don't know I don't even know what

1462.31 --> 1464.79
I'm doing anymore

1491.33 --> 1498.12
that's funny

1493.909 --> 1503.159
yeah you know I also that Hagrid Wells

1498.12 --> 1506.2099999999998
thanks for sharing that but I also saw

1503.159 --> 1509.7890000000002
fairies when I was very young

1506.21 --> 1514.559
it has been a continuing theme for some

1509.789 --> 1518.19
time and I think also that again like

1514.559 --> 1526.62
the dark world what is that it seems to

1518.19 --> 1531.8700000000001
have been a natural response mechanism

1526.62 --> 1537.389
to trauma to tension that I couldn't

1531.87 --> 1540.539
handle and it doesn't work like that

1537.389 --> 1544.529
anymore though because yeah now when I

1540.539 --> 1546.87
get a lot of tension I maybe get like

1544.529 --> 1551.19
depressed sensation like my body may

1546.87 --> 1555.1789999999999
start to get overly tense but it doesn't

1551.19 --> 1558.48
really work like it did back then not

1555.179 --> 1563.8200000000002
the effect where I would literally be

1558.48 --> 1566.85
launched into on to the other side and I

1563.82 --> 1569.539
think even there were fairies out there

1566.85 --> 1569.539
that were

1571.25 --> 1577.89
basically consoling me or even like

1574.56 --> 1580.59
entertaining me together borrowing all

1577.89 --> 1584.1000000000001
that [ __ ] it's so weird

1580.59 --> 1586.49
I came in to hang out with you like the

1584.1 --> 1586.49
good old days

1587.75 --> 1594.0
there's no good old days but I welcome

1591.48 --> 1595.8600000000001
you anyway thank you appreciate it

1594.0 --> 1598.2
I was bored I got off work a little

1595.86 --> 1600.3899999999999

1621.19 --> 1626.3490000000002
so yeah I just check I just I just saw

1623.679 --> 1627.7
you notification and I didn't even check

1626.349 --> 1630.549
while you were talking about all right

1627.7 --> 1636.1290000000001
talking about spirit just stuffs just so

1630.549 --> 1640.389
you know so do you have anything the

1636.129 --> 1642.4289999999999
winch to insert talk about because

1640.389 --> 1645.82
otherwise I'm gonna just be rambling on

1642.429 --> 1649.95
like I typically do and no you don't

1645.82 --> 1654.519
really like it and very open about that

1649.95 --> 1657.1290000000001
so yeah it's all right I mean I mean it

1654.519 --> 1661.989
just chilling mood today just more of a

1657.129 --> 1664.599
listener then then a talker so yeah

1661.989 --> 1667.419
chillin it's a little chilly in the cold

1664.599 --> 1670.509

right

1676.179 --> 1686.259
good for you no work doing stuff is

1680.169 --> 1688.509
satisfying cannot be denied it sucks you

1686.259 --> 1690.099
know like if socks is physical work and

1688.509 --> 1692.799
whatever I was doing the frozen

1690.099 --> 1694.6899999999998
Department today I talked shelves in a

1692.799 --> 1697.69
supermarket you know that's what I do I

1694.69 --> 1699.729
just just put product in the chest but I

1697.69 --> 1701.739
took care of the frozen Department

1699.729 --> 1704.799
yesterday I had a couple eyelids on the

1701.739 --> 1707.08
sub boxes and I was sealing the doors

1704.799 --> 1710.649
making a little bit you know could be

1707.08 --> 1715.499
worse you know I considered like working

1710.649 --> 1722.83
in a very organic supermarket but yeah

1715.499 --> 1727.509
not young enough they are all very

1722.83 --> 1729.97
liberal minded and I don't have an

1727.509 --> 1732.369
entire life of experience and there's

1729.97 --> 1734.309
like hundreds of others that do and are

1732.369 --> 1737.649
very desperate for these types of jobs

1734.309 --> 1739.629
so yeah that didn't really work out I'm

1737.649 --> 1742.359
still open for it you know organic

1739.629 --> 1747.1899999999998
supermarket I'd be very good at it I

1742.359 --> 1750.3999999999999
know like so much [ __ ] about food

1747.19 --> 1752.8
yeah so much I can like yeah yeah

1750.4 --> 1755.0500000000002
anybody could have basically asked me

1752.8 --> 1758.01
for nutritional advice and it could be

1755.05 --> 1761.77
like okay do this that that that order

1758.01 --> 1767.5
could give just free advice for

1761.77 --> 1770.1399999999999
customers but yeah I mean my shift right

1767.5 --> 1772.18
now is the overnight shift 10:00 p.m. to

1770.14 --> 1774.25
7:00 in the morning you know and at the

1772.18 --> 1775.9
time I get off work when used to be show

1774.25 --> 1780.07
starts you know so you have a guide on

1775.9 --> 1782.02
my time zone or whatever but there's no

1780.07 --> 1786.1599999999999
many customers just two or three weirdos

1782.02 --> 1788.08
her tonight I'm like drunks and during

1786.16 --> 1790.18
the daytime before when I used to work

1788.08 --> 1793.4499999999998
for Walmart I work almost eight years

1790.18 --> 1795.8200000000002
and I did all the ship you know open in

1793.45 --> 1798.25
chief and I did manager in the afternoon

1795.82 --> 1798.6399999999999
or like three or four years so it was

1798.25 --> 1800.89
good

1798.64 --> 1804.24
a customer interaction I enjoyed it very

1800.89 --> 1813.8100000000002
much man I'm a people person you know

1804.24 --> 1816.55
yeah sorry office you are there were so

1813.81 --> 1818.35
yeah yeah yeah there were some people

1816.55 --> 1820.6599999999999
that try to give me a hard time a little

1818.35 --> 1823.24
bit aful whatever the racist comments

1820.66 --> 1826.3600000000001
are trying to mock my accent or whatever

1823.24 --> 1831.36
but ninety 98% of the people were cool

1826.36 --> 1833.6799999999998
you know I love why it's trendy you know

1831.36 --> 1837.28
all the social justice warrior

1833.68 --> 1839.77
everywhere like so yeah people are like

1837.28 --> 1842.59
screwed it I'm gonna be racist because

1839.77 --> 1846.19
they don't like it that's the actual

1842.59 --> 1848.4399999999998
effect I wonder how many people realize

1846.19 --> 1852.67
that everything the social justice

1848.44 --> 1856.0800000000002
warriors do is actually encouraging that

1852.67 --> 1858.22
which they try to fight literally

1856.08 --> 1860.3799999999999
absolutely hundred percent literal

1858.22 --> 1864.4
that's the effect everything they fight

1860.38 --> 1868.5600000000002
it manifests as a counter response it it

1864.4 --> 1868.5600000000002
was probably even designed like that

1870.82 --> 1878.1689999999999
through that through that me it's freaky

1883.089 --> 1889.609
yeah you got a nice nice - super cheddar

1886.219 --> 1891.6490000000001
people he's didn't that kid man I know I

1889.609 --> 1893.779
feel happy for you bro because I know I

1891.649 --> 1897.4989999999998
mean people needed them and I'm happy

1893.779 --> 1899.57
for you though I really I mean I really

1897.499 --> 1902.059
can't afford to give super Chester

1899.57 --> 1904.759
nobody if I could I super shot myself if

1902.059 --> 1907.07
I sense you know but but that's good you

1904.759 --> 1908.119
know honest people that dislike year you

1907.07 --> 1909.649
know I appreciate it

1908.119 --> 1913.82
there's people that really don't need it

1909.649 --> 1916.579
and get a lot from any group on the

1913.82 --> 1918.499
YouTube you know and that sucks but

1916.579 --> 1920.749
people that really need it doesn't suck

1918.499 --> 1923.3890000000001
satisfaction I don't think so I don't I

1920.749 --> 1927.559
think money has its price more and more

1923.389 --> 1932.119
I think that nobody gets a lot of money

1927.559 --> 1934.519
if they don't get bit in the ass in an

1932.119 --> 1939.309
equal and opposite fashion eventually

1934.519 --> 1942.669
but hey wow thank you [ __ ] you that is a

1939.309 --> 1948.139
substantial donation thank you so much

1942.669 --> 1950.3790000000001
interest and kudos to you mean I to Nate

1948.139 --> 1952.82
and I'm those who does a daily show I

1950.379 --> 1954.549
couldn't do a daily show bro like I

1952.82 --> 1957.4689999999998
don't know what to talk about you know

1954.549 --> 1960.019
rambling or whatever I mean you got you

1957.469 --> 1962.45
got you got a mind a beautiful mind I

1960.019 --> 1965.059
have a lot of subject N and come field

1962.45 --> 1967.759
time you know I couldn't do that I'm

1965.059 --> 1970.399
more of a I joined you know a little bit

1967.759 --> 1972.8890000000001
and I comment here and there but all

1970.399 --> 1975.4089999999999
myself to come up with subjects I

1972.889 --> 1978.529
couldn't do it I mean they just happen

1975.409 --> 1981.3490000000002
it just happens really I that's the

1978.529 --> 1983.779
weird thing about it you know like news

1981.349 --> 1986.059
organizations even

1983.779 --> 1989.749
independent once they have teams and

1986.059 --> 1992.57
they put things together and like people

1989.749 --> 1995.3890000000001
shove news and then they choose the path

1992.57 --> 1999.4689999999998
for the nose or what I didn't do any of

1995.389 --> 2003.129
that zero barely is sometimes I do when

1999.469 --> 2006.46
I really especially earlier and also on

2003.129 --> 2009.369
the Flat Earth the talks then I did do

2006.46 --> 2014.769
it as many times as possible but now it

2009.369 --> 2017.589
just it just whatever comes comes and it

2014.769 --> 2020.529
just comes out and I tried to put it out

2017.589 --> 2022.749
make something useful it's like okay

2020.529 --> 2024.909
what Lego parts are now gonna be

2022.749 --> 2029.71
spawning out of my mind and then okay

2024.909 --> 2032.229
it's this can do this with it that's

2029.71 --> 2034.839
what I'm doing I mean English is not

2032.229 --> 2038.6490000000001
your first language or easy no it's not

2034.839 --> 2040.029
for how long do you learn English in

2038.649 --> 2043.2389999999998
your country you know when you were a

2040.029 --> 2047.25
little kid or something I had I was

2043.239 --> 2050.71
lucky enough to be in a generation where

2047.25 --> 2055.659
cartoons were all English spoken with

2050.71 --> 2058.559
Dutch subtitles so I actually kind of

2055.659 --> 2064.44
learned the feel and the culture for

2058.559 --> 2067.289
American from when I was six and I

2064.44 --> 2070.089
watched like the Transformers and

2067.289 --> 2070.48
Optimus Prime was my greatest role model

2070.089 --> 2073.089
bro

2070.48 --> 2075.129
it helps many a cartoons and he you know

2073.089 --> 2075.7
yeah but you thicken kids but not

2075.129 --> 2078.73
anymore

2075.7 --> 2081.97
not any it's all Dutch now everything is

2078.73 --> 2085.289
Dutch they completely really well but

2081.97 --> 2088.45
yeah that that pushed me a great deal to

2085.289 --> 2090.849
focus on English like I really wanted to

2088.45 --> 2096.7
learn English I wanted to speak English

2090.849 --> 2099.96
like the real thing when I even remember

2096.7 --> 2099.96
one thing that when I was

2102.06 --> 2108.81
from 8 9 on or something like I really

2106.5 --> 2110.61
wanted to do that and I never really got

2108.81 --> 2112.71
good at any other language but yeah

2110.61 --> 2117.3
English I got a better grade on English

2112.71 --> 2119.4
than I did on Dutch school so how long

2117.3 --> 2121.86
you been speaking English

2119.4 --> 2130.35
I mean conversational like that maybe 15

2121.86 --> 2137.7000000000003
20 years that's that's a difficult

2130.35 --> 2140.54
question see real spoken right no I've

2137.7 --> 2147.1499999999996
been writing English forever forever

2140.54 --> 2149.52
like since 2000 something ever as ever

2147.15 --> 2153.15
since like the internet kind of popped

2149.52 --> 2155.43
up yeah English being English writing it

2153.15 --> 2157.6800000000003
all the time but actually speaking it

2155.43 --> 2163.02
well weirdly enough that actually

2157.68 --> 2164.94
started with YouTube you guys he was

2163.02 --> 2167.46
bright kid and I mean sometimes when I'm

2164.94 --> 2170.2200000000003
working I'm thinking all these like

2167.46 --> 2173.4
dialogues and I'm very elaborate you

2170.22 --> 2177.35
know way to to the grammatical I'm the

2173.4 --> 2179.61
sentences how can I you know properly

2177.35 --> 2182.4
structured a sentence and then when I

2179.61 --> 2184.56
like right now in the spot I get dark

2182.4 --> 2187.56
and the words just don't come out you

2184.56 --> 2192.33
know I just freeze I got a really good

2187.56 --> 2195.06
teacher in school so yeah he was an

2192.33 --> 2197.7599999999998
awesome English teacher with a lot of

2195.06 --> 2200.61
comedy like his favorite way to spend

2197.76 --> 2204.09
the class time was putting on Black

2200.61 --> 2205.83
Adder or Monty Python videos so yeah it

2204.09 --> 2207.32
was safe to say he was everyone's

2205.83 --> 2212.79
favorite teacher

2207.32 --> 2214.86
except that's always one year yeah they

2212.79 --> 2216.48
teach English in Puerto Rico in all the

2214.86 --> 2218.85
grades from first grade till you

2216.48 --> 2221.91
graduate high school but then there are

2218.85 --> 2224.04
this handful of students of African kids

2221.91 --> 2226.77
that really learned the English and

2224.04 --> 2228.75
practice a lot and conversation and then

2226.77 --> 2229.98
there's the other ones like me that we

2228.75 --> 2232.41
just want to make it through we just

2229.98 --> 2234.15
want to hear we have the grade even a D

2232.41 --> 2235.8689999999997
- at least we fasted you know that was

2234.15 --> 2237.369
me I never had good grades

2235.869 --> 2241.21
English wasn't interested you know I

2237.369 --> 2242.559
start speaking it pretty much in 2005 so

2241.21 --> 2244.66
it's been just a little while I was

2242.559 --> 2247.69
thirty years old I was all do you know

2244.66 --> 2254.6499999999996
so it's been a more of a struggle for me

2247.69 --> 2256.7490000000003
right well you at least her very social

2254.65 --> 2259.329
you have social warmth and that's

2256.749 --> 2262.3799999999997
another way to deal with it you know so

2259.329 --> 2265.0890000000004
if you're really social if you're really

2262.38 --> 2269.71
loving despite everything despite

2265.089 --> 2273.67
whatever then you don't even need a

2269.71 --> 2275.109
mouth really not true and I don't help

2273.67 --> 2278.049
back you know in the beginning the first

2275.109 --> 2280.18
two years I shy away a little bit

2278.049 --> 2281.769
because I felt the mocking and laughing

2280.18 --> 2283.93
like holy [ __ ] what he's trying to say

2281.769 --> 2285.8489999999997
and there were these certain people but

2283.93 --> 2287.98
I always push through that you know what

2285.849 --> 2291.2400000000002
I'm gonna ignore those and and just

2287.98 --> 2293.98
learn learn absorb and repeat you know

2291.24 --> 2298.8689999999997
it's a training you might want to get

2293.98 --> 2302.38
some first before we continue yet the

2298.869 --> 2304.7490000000003
observer donated 9.99 dollars thank you

2302.38 --> 2307.42
so much and yes

2304.749 --> 2308.68
life is good even though it's bad that

2307.42 --> 2310.96
is brilliant

2308.68 --> 2313.21
that's brilliant totally agree with that

2310.96 --> 2315.48
yeah there's always a middle ground man

2313.21 --> 2318.849
where we all we all can be happy bro

2315.48 --> 2322.029
there's one thing that really helps to

2318.849 --> 2325.119
learn how to speak language your own

2322.029 --> 2328.239
language or another language and that is

2325.119 --> 2333.099
not by learning the language as much but

2328.239 --> 2335.349
learning the way your jaw and everything

2333.099 --> 2338.259
is supposed to move to learn to

2335.349 --> 2341.099
physically mimic it and there's there's

2338.259 --> 2343.45
teachings for this it's the name again

2341.099 --> 2347.38
through that's always the funny part for

2343.45 --> 2350.739
me I thrive and I try but you really

2347.38 --> 2353.4700000000003
it's like almost like serious muscle

2350.739 --> 2355.45
training but it's this and you have to

2353.47 --> 2359.16
have somebody that can guide you in this

2355.45 --> 2359.16
what's the name again

2361.08 --> 2366.73
articulation it's like there's training

2364.33 --> 2371.23
for articulation and if you get that

2366.73 --> 2373.9
right then your accent will fade away

2371.23 --> 2376.84
and you'll start to automatically fall

2373.9 --> 2380.6800000000003
in that real language structure you you

2376.84 --> 2383.02
become the language if you get the

2380.68 --> 2386.77
physical aspect of it right it's not

2383.02 --> 2390.22
just the words it's not just words you

2386.77 --> 2394.21
translate through verbally no it's the

2390.22 --> 2396.91
essence of what that language is and the

2394.21 --> 2400.69
people that use it really there's more

2396.91 --> 2403.44
to language than just language and I've

2400.69 --> 2408.84
studied a lot of English and like

2403.44 --> 2412.6
admirable English Oxford English and

2408.84 --> 2417.1000000000004
movies and just inspiring figures and I

2412.6 --> 2419.62
try to basically copy part of that and

2417.1 --> 2421.93
make it my own and this is what it's

2419.62 --> 2424.96
become and never completely lost the

2421.93 --> 2430.6
Dutch accent it's it's almost impossible

2424.96 --> 2432.4
maybe completely impossible but yeah the

2430.6 --> 2435.16
first I think the first English that I

2432.4 --> 2436.33
learned like memorized was the Bob

2435.16 --> 2440.5899999999997
Marley songs

2436.33 --> 2442.39
rastaman hay which I mean I won all that

2440.59 --> 2444.6400000000003
stuff you know I didn't know what he was

2442.39 --> 2447.1299999999997
saying I had an idea you know a little

2444.64 --> 2449.29
bit but I did I was just mimicking and

2447.13 --> 2451.15
repeating what he was saying now until

2449.29 --> 2453.13
whatever ten twelve years ago that I

2451.15 --> 2455.32
know I say like now I understand the

2453.13 --> 2457.0
lyrics you know it's about the freedom

2455.32 --> 2459.73
about their you know all these good

2457.0 --> 2462.25
stuff before I just learned it you know

2459.73 --> 2464.26
at first you just get the words and then

2462.25 --> 2465.7
later you start to see the mirror and

2464.26 --> 2470.3500000000004
then you start to see the meanings

2465.7 --> 2473.2
behind the meanings and yeah that that

2470.35 --> 2474.75
happens as you grow older it happened

2473.2 --> 2478.8999999999996
with me look I started to just

2474.75 --> 2481.87
phonetically copy really cool sounding

2478.9 --> 2484.33
sentences you know that's how it started

2481.87 --> 2487.74
with me like ooh Optimus Prime said

2484.33 --> 2490.5699999999997
something and it sounded so glorious I

2487.74 --> 2492.0699999999997
just phonetically copied just to see

2490.57 --> 2494.44
like is that

2492.07 --> 2498.5800000000004
exactly how it sounds what yeah like a

2494.44 --> 2500.56
parrot that's how it started and it'll

2498.58 --> 2504.15
through practicing that at a young age

2500.56 --> 2507.07
did give me a lot of advantage actually

2504.15 --> 2511.9
doing English class because everybody

2507.07 --> 2514.9
was like and teach you like no no no you

2511.9 --> 2517.63
say it like this and and is like when

2514.9 --> 2521.89
it's my turn it's just like I just roll

2517.63 --> 2525.07
it out like I've always known it this

2521.89 --> 2527.44
funny little a little fun fact we're in

2525.07 --> 2529.03
in college after I got out of high

2527.44 --> 2529.96
school I went to for this for like two

2529.03 --> 2532.0
years in Puerto Rico

2529.96 --> 2534.13
and we had the English class right and

2532.0 --> 2536.32
there was this little old lady and she

2534.13 --> 2539.26
were like alright let's learn how to say

2536.32 --> 2541.3900000000003
thank you and then she go in front of me

2539.26 --> 2543.5200000000004
like writing 2 inches of my face and she

2541.39 --> 2544.93
stick her tongue out and then she said

2543.52 --> 2547.33
alright you stick your tongue out and

2544.93 --> 2549.6099999999997
then as the tongue is coming in then you

2547.33 --> 2553.06
start saying the world thank you like

2549.61 --> 2554.65
you swallow in the PhD the tea style and

2553.06 --> 2556.96
it was so funny and there was this guy

2554.65 --> 2559.21
he's got this condition that he had a

2556.96 --> 2561.46
little short tongue like a little short

2559.21 --> 2564.7
tongue and he cannot speak it out and

2561.46 --> 2565.84
she like thank you I need thank you and

2564.7 --> 2567.79
she said no no no no you gotta stick

2565.84 --> 2569.44
your tongue out and he like trying to

2567.79 --> 2571.54
put the tongue out it was [ __ ]

2569.44 --> 2573.76
hilarious man I never forget that we

2571.54 --> 2575.5
used to call him Robocop because he had

2573.76 --> 2577.84
an accident he got run over by a car and

2575.5 --> 2581.2
he got a lot of like why are some

2577.84 --> 2583.63
freaking using his body and he used to

2581.2 --> 2585.04
walk all funny like Robocop and he

2583.63 --> 2589.4700000000003
talked funny like that's cool I don't

2585.04 --> 2592.63
know little fun stories will get tragic

2589.47 --> 2595.0899999999997
it was funny he was a drinker bro he

2592.63 --> 2599.07
could drink like a [ __ ] I've been

2595.09 --> 2599.07
driving fast she crazy good

2601.58 --> 2605.6
I don't know what that come from I just

2604.49 --> 2611.6
had to throw it out there

2605.6 --> 2615.02
Robocop what's not strange like the

2611.6 --> 2618.3199999999997
concept of Robocop at the time was

2615.02 --> 2620.96
pretty impactful still is it still is a

2618.32 --> 2624.7400000000002
movie and you have to realize that it

2620.96 --> 2627.17
was deep first I'm not entirely the

2624.74 --> 2630.47
first but pretty much the first movie

2627.17 --> 2632.9
ever where the concept well gone Liberia

2630.47 --> 2637.22
that was really out there like there's

2632.9 --> 2639.62
been metropolis from what is it 90 27 or

2637.22 --> 2641.75
something that also kind of had that but

2639.62 --> 2645.95
that was like pretty too long ago and

2641.75 --> 2648.02
weird and weird Malthusian influences in

2645.95 --> 2650.1499999999996
that [ __ ] totally occult movie but

2648.02 --> 2655.91
Robocop yeah that was the first time it

2650.15 --> 2658.94
was like everybody got to see this you

2655.91 --> 2662.75
have yeah a tragedy but then you get the

2658.94 --> 2665.09
power of being a robot and yeah that was

2662.75 --> 2669.47
pretty impactful it was in part like a

2665.09 --> 2673.13
superhero movie you know or it was a no

2669.47 --> 2675.4399999999996
yeah robot and it was only followed up

2673.13 --> 2677.62
basically by the terminator concept

2675.44 --> 2680.78
which was kind of the next step in that

2677.62 --> 2684.62
that even stripped the humanity and then

2680.78 --> 2686.75
tried to reintroduce it around through

2684.62 --> 2689.18
the people with the interactions but

2686.75 --> 2692.6
yeah that but Robocop really started

2689.18 --> 2695.0899999999997
that yeah I think about the ad really I

2692.6 --> 2697.85
really put it in the consciousness and

2695.09 --> 2702.26
also like the concept of the singularity

2697.85 --> 2705.86
and Skynet and that still roams through

2702.26 --> 2707.9900000000002
our culture to this day yeah I think in

2705.86 --> 2710.42
they may be from the latest evidence but

2707.99 --> 2713.3599999999997
in the eighties it's where we start

2710.42 --> 2715.07
getting good ideas about the future and

2713.36 --> 2717.29
on the movies you know what can be done

2715.07 --> 2719.42
what can be possible on everybody trying

2717.29 --> 2722.36
to overachieve shoulder that it was a

2719.42 --> 2724.64
good good decade for movies bro the

2722.36 --> 2726.4100000000003
eighties was amazing and then the night

2724.64 --> 2729.62
is new but the eighties it was amazing

2726.41 --> 2733.27
and terrible see yeah yeah through day

2729.62 --> 2736.42
like I'm I'm a fan

2733.27 --> 2737.77
of a couple of reviewers that are really

2736.42 --> 2739.78
liberal reviewers that I've been

2737.77 --> 2741.49
following like as long as I've been

2739.78 --> 2746.11
following Alex Jones they've been at it

2741.49 --> 2748.81
for an over a decade and yeah they show

2746.11 --> 2751.3
some movies out there from the 80s

2748.81 --> 2755.41
especially and the 90s that are just so

2751.3 --> 2757.8100000000004
crazy and at the time it's so funny

2755.41 --> 2759.43
because they even like reflect in their

2757.81 --> 2761.32
own way like oh yeah I remember this

2759.43 --> 2762.94
movie is so awesome I remember it to be

2761.32 --> 2770.6800000000003
awesome and then they watch it again as

2762.94 --> 2772.78
an adult and it's like yeah but did you

2770.68 --> 2775.87
got you got classic like goes for

2772.78 --> 2778.48
ghostbusters and and gremlins you know

2775.87 --> 2780.91
and the Terminator stuff like that that

2778.48 --> 2784.18
was a good movies you know gremlins was

2780.91 --> 2786.25
very interesting I was like I saw him on

2784.18 --> 2789.22
the movie theater I thought on theatre

2786.25 --> 2792.64
broad agreement awesome scary I had this

2789.22 --> 2795.97
weird period where when I first saw it

2792.64 --> 2800.14
like I would rent the video of it and

2795.97 --> 2802.99
then on my tape recorder recorded the

2800.14 --> 2805.96
sound of the entire movie and then like

2802.99 --> 2808.12
during break time listen to the tape of

2805.96 --> 2811.3
the movie because we love that movie so

2808.12 --> 2813.22
much and then we would basically reenact

2811.3 --> 2814.9
it from memory just from the sound just

2813.22 --> 2816.6099999999997
saying like yeah now this is happening

2814.9 --> 2819.31
now this is happening because we just

2816.61 --> 2821.2000000000003
memorized it from the sound that [ __ ]

2819.31 --> 2823.7799999999997
yeah and then you got the whole world or

2821.2 --> 2826.0299999999997
world general like The Nightmare on Elm

2823.78 --> 2828.25
Street you got the Jason Voorhees you

2826.03 --> 2830.53
know you got the poltergeist poltergeist

2828.25 --> 2832.3
was a cult movie for me every single

2830.53 --> 2836.4700000000003
Sunday after church I used to watch

2832.3 --> 2845.3700000000003
voltage eyesbrow know I had a mean no no

2836.47 --> 2850.54
I like the plague until a certain point

2845.37 --> 2853.42
like then I started to see predator

2850.54 --> 2857.56
predator was probably the first real

2853.42 --> 2860.36
serious scary movie that I saw didn't

2857.56 --> 2863.18
see it like right away but

2860.36 --> 2865.4
was I had like 16 or something or 17 and

2863.18 --> 2867.04
it could barely handle it who gave me

2865.4 --> 2870.23
nightmares

2867.04 --> 2872.99
but raping movie bro yeah but that is

2870.23 --> 2875.27
one one amazing movie because of the

2872.99 --> 2879.89
intensity because of the realness of it

2875.27 --> 2884.87
and what is sorry yeah another era oh my

2879.89 --> 2886.91
god what a bizarre movie is that that's

2884.87 --> 2889.0099999999998
like a never never saw that one there's

2886.91 --> 2891.3799999999997
a new movie called it's rolling in now

2889.01 --> 2893.0
yeah probably new stuff but there's

2891.38 --> 2896.4700000000003
nothing like the old thing because that

2893.0 --> 2901.43
is like one of the very early Japanese

2896.47 --> 2903.6499999999996
anime and they had everything hand-drawn

2901.43 --> 2907.46
it's just in there were like racing

2903.65 --> 2909.89
scenes where you were like racers on the

2907.46 --> 2913.34
highway and you're like zoom in and the

2909.89 --> 2915.74
background moving in 3d towards you and

2913.34 --> 2919.3700000000003
it was all hand-drawn frame by frame

2915.74 --> 2923.72
it's like wow you feel it it was

2919.37 --> 2926.42
tangible such such intensity and the

2923.72 --> 2930.95
whole movies like intense and maniacal

2926.42 --> 2934.13
as well and it's like hyper slow fiction

2930.95 --> 2936.08
mystery it's amazing hello Close

2934.13 --> 2938.54
Encounters of the Third Kind he's one of

2936.08 --> 2941.0299999999997
my favorite movies of all time I used to

2938.54 --> 2944.63
watch even all the time I see it all the

2941.03 --> 2949.28
time every time they showed me I used to

2944.63 --> 2952.58
like it but I liked et a little more but

2949.28 --> 2956.15
I totally grew out of it it's not know

2952.58 --> 2957.5
why I'm much email is right Joba movies

2956.15 --> 2959.03
there's something wrong with these

2957.5 --> 2961.49
movies it's weird

2959.03 --> 2963.8300000000004
can't put my finger on it although the

2961.49 --> 2969.9799999999996
others like reviewed and all cult review

2963.83 --> 2971.72
and shipment I think for very long some

2969.98 --> 2975.17
of my favorites are time-travel movies

2971.72 --> 2977.39
from the oldest ones to the newest ones

2975.17 --> 2978.4700000000003
you know that I enjoyed a lot deja boo'

2977.39 --> 2981.41
I don't know if you saw it themselves

2978.47 --> 2983.06
was in some movie it's really good movie

2981.41 --> 2985.49
it's about kind of time travel or

2983.06 --> 2989.2
whatever there's a lot in between time

2985.49 --> 2989.2
travel movies I just loved the idea

2989.9 --> 2994.9100000000003
right back to the future man that's

2992.18 --> 2997.25
wrong the [ __ ] oh my god yeah

2994.91 --> 2999.68
what the other was such a good movie

2997.25 --> 3002.29
series been my favorite for a long time

2999.68 --> 3004.5699999999997
it it never really it won't really go

3002.29 --> 3010.65
away ever totally as a favorite it is

3004.57 --> 3010.65
just so well done like the music and

3012.63 --> 3020.53
it's funny but really one of the one of

3018.73 --> 3023.7400000000002
the best directors you know beautiful

3020.53 --> 3027.2200000000003
mind to create yeah but it's also very

3023.74 --> 3030.7599999999998
special because it's not a total kitty

3027.22 --> 3033.3999999999996
movie like really weeny but it's not

3030.76 --> 3038.05
entirely adult either it's like really

3033.4 --> 3041.4100000000003
well kept in between and that's pretty

3038.05 --> 3044.77
unique you gotta watch a ready player

3041.41 --> 3046.8399999999997
one scene from last year yeah Anthony

3044.77 --> 3053.02
MOV from theater but it's really good I

3046.84 --> 3057.9700000000003
like it man it's pretty decent it's

3053.02 --> 3060.91
pretty little and as a made movie it

3057.97 --> 3064.48
still has a lot of creepy fat it's like

3060.91 --> 3069.7
the whole nowadays totally overkill

3064.48 --> 3071.89
amped up aggressive energy like all the

3069.7 --> 3076.06
movies now almost everything is just too

3071.89 --> 3080.14
much too strong too much too glamorous

3076.06 --> 3084.06
CGI too heavy a story too much it's like

3080.14 --> 3086.47
really weird and I'm waiting because

3084.06 --> 3088.92
they went filbert he say he was gonna

3086.47 --> 3092.68
make a movie called rogue robocar lips

3088.92 --> 3096.3
robot ellipse okay

3092.68 --> 3096.2999999999997
hey did you go

3098.16 --> 3101.3289999999997
okay he drew up

3109.32 --> 3116.01
movies movies a lot of influence on the

3111.78 --> 3118.92
end drop its mighty I myself own yeah

3116.01 --> 3120.8700000000003
that's a but yeah when it comes to like

3118.92 --> 3124.55
things like horror movies it's really

3120.87 --> 3128.4
odd because I literally avoided them

3124.55 --> 3132.57
like up into a very late age I think I

3128.4 --> 3139.23
probably just started even trying to

3132.57 --> 3142.11
watch that type of movie after it was 18

3139.23 --> 3144.78
or something I watch The Exorcist like

3142.11 --> 3146.67
hardcore like the uncut version like

3144.78 --> 3148.9500000000003
when I was a little kid maybe five six

3146.67 --> 3151.77
years old bro my brother put it to me I

3148.95 --> 3153.27
was so freaked out and then I played by

3151.77 --> 3156.12
my head one day and I was the scene

3153.27 --> 3159.77
where she comes by brown on their back

3156.12 --> 3162.72
of his dad the first time I saw that I

3159.77 --> 3167.82
literally pissed my pants and screamed

3162.72 --> 3169.41
and ran away so terrified oh my god I

3167.82 --> 3170.9700000000003
wasn't hard kid I used to watch all

3169.41 --> 3173.04
these horror movies and my dad used to

3170.97 --> 3176.0099999999998
like I got you a new movie like yeah a

3173.04 --> 3178.71
nightmare part to me celebrating and

3176.01 --> 3181.53
Jason to every time all the new ones

3178.71 --> 3185.16
came in my dad knew what movies to get

3181.53 --> 3188.07
me horror movies I've watched a lot of

3185.16 --> 3188.7599999999998
those like after I went into the Gulf

3188.07 --> 3191.46
see

3188.76 --> 3195.3300000000004
for reals so I still have like a movie

3191.46 --> 3197.94
library with well also like historically

3195.33 --> 3201.33
themed and fantasy movies and a lot of

3197.94 --> 3204.09
horror [ __ ] as well but not like they're

3201.33 --> 3207.54
dis more the inspiring fantasy based on

3204.09 --> 3210.6600000000003
inspired things like Hellraiser and such

3207.54 --> 3213.44
and oh yeah like Hellraiser - it's like

3210.66 --> 3216.27
one of so fascinating a movie is like

3213.44 --> 3218.37
well for obvious reasons that it's sort

3216.27 --> 3220.53
of like hey do you know basically

3218.37 --> 3224.52
introduce this other realm it's like oh

3220.53 --> 3226.6800000000003
yeah you know and it's a giant maze and

3224.52 --> 3230.99
like my fantasy goes completely all over

3226.68 --> 3234.3599999999997
the place with that movie but and other

3230.99 --> 3237.54
like that but like the total slasher

3234.36 --> 3240.9300000000003
[ __ ] I could never stand that really not

3237.54 --> 3245.069
really maybe like Halloween and

3240.93 --> 3248.0099999999998
little but it's because it was just so

3245.069 --> 3249.98
basic and so well done and was so the

3248.01 --> 3252.96
killer was so stoic

3249.98 --> 3255.54
yeah and that was like the first time

3252.96 --> 3258.21
like I think sometimes that they

3255.54 --> 3260.0099999999998
invented the concept or reinvented it

3258.21 --> 3262.7400000000002
modern wise because of course it's all

3260.01 --> 3264.599
but basically a remake of the

3262.74 --> 3268.02
black-and-white old ones where they did

3264.599 --> 3271.6800000000003
that before but er theatrically and but

3268.02 --> 3277.29
yeah like Halloween it was like the

3271.68 --> 3282.089
total silent stoic robotic killer

3277.29 --> 3286.8
basically yeah people did it was an

3282.089 --> 3289.23
Irving very much so but I don't even

3286.8 --> 3291.4500000000003
live follow-ups and everything yeah the

3289.23 --> 3293.819
evil did the first one was horrifying

3291.45 --> 3296.25
you know to him day well yeah with the

3293.819 --> 3298.8
basement tank and banging and whatever

3296.25 --> 3302.24
the evil power coming in the tea and you

3298.8 --> 3305.13
know and all that but have you seen

3302.24 --> 3306.8089999999997
darkness though yeah everyone's got a

3305.13 --> 3308.76
little pony I've been army of Darkness

3306.809 --> 3311.1600000000003
all man went overboard it was hilarious

3308.76 --> 3314.3390000000004
yeah I'll never forget really good never

3311.16 --> 3318.17
never ever forget the scene where in one

3314.339 --> 3322.799
single shot you see a guy with like

3318.17 --> 3325.92
props like stuck like a skeleton face

3322.799 --> 3328.17
stuck over a black mask and then right

3325.92 --> 3339.9900000000002
next to it you literally see a skeleton

3328.17 --> 3342.059
hung by a wire walking neck yeah that

3339.99 --> 3343.68
was crazy that movie that guy Bruce

3342.059 --> 3345.5400000000004
Campbell's he got talking the same

3343.68 --> 3347.7
character he not done a couple serious

3345.54 --> 3349.95
and movies but I think he's doing some

3347.7 --> 3351.39
serious like ass versus the Evil Dead or

3349.95 --> 3354.4199999999996
something like that you know and she

3351.39 --> 3357.18
exists yeah yeah but they but he never

3354.42 --> 3360.2400000000002
really escaped that character that he

3357.18 --> 3365.52
became it was so it's so iconic the way

3360.24 --> 3368.64
he was that weird semi meta here you

3365.52 --> 3371.94
know give him [ __ ] hero and he never got

3368.64 --> 3373.25
off that that stereotype like everybody

3371.94 --> 3376.39
just saw that so

3373.25 --> 3379.19
couldn't really act anyway else anymore

3376.39 --> 3384.74
why are you not acting like we want you

3379.19 --> 3386.09
to yeah I see some some some people get

3384.74 --> 3388.31
stuck in the character like the Harry

3386.09 --> 3390.05
Potter guy he he makes a couple good

3388.31 --> 3391.4
movies but he's still Harry Potter for

3390.05 --> 3396.26
everybody that's a you know that's Harry

3391.4 --> 3402.05
Potter you know I see yeah never get

3396.26 --> 3406.19
away from that yep lot of debate 700

3402.05 --> 3409.3100000000004
live I got notification all right yeah

3406.19 --> 3414.2000000000003

3409.31 --> 3420.7999999999997

3438.92 --> 3443.9900000000002
distraction in this case wasn't too bad

3441.65 --> 3449.21
just talking about other stuff and

3443.99 --> 3451.85
movies and it's not always good to

3449.21 --> 3459.65
always keep on talking so serious and

3451.85 --> 3462.29
[ __ ] not healthy but yeah if I'm left to

3459.65 --> 3467.87
my own devices I will typically always

3462.29 --> 3470.3
do that I just always go there but it's

3467.87 --> 3472.16
good to have some superficial stuff to

3470.3 --> 3474.5
talk about as well we're just going

3472.16 --> 3477.62
through memories it's good good to

3474.5 --> 3478.81
reflect back so with something new you

3477.62 --> 3482.21
can pick out of it

3478.81 --> 3485.65
