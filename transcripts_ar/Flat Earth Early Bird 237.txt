no yeah the weather today is still kind

71.75 --> 78.41
of cloudy it's been raining here and

74.66 --> 82.729
there a little not really too bad right

78.41 --> 86.21
now I hoping I'm hoping it's gonna stay

82.729 --> 88.899
dry because I got my clothes out for

86.21 --> 88.899
drying

94.33 --> 103.25
there's a lot of noise outside but yeah

99.74 --> 105.16999999999999
it's calm not windy it's not really cold

103.25 --> 107.39
but it's not very warm yeah it's kind of

105.17 --> 114.29
fresh really especially when the sun's

107.39 --> 121.06
not out but yeah it's still kind of nice

114.29 --> 126.29
I I walk outside this morning through a

121.06 --> 130.64000000000001
walking path as usual saw a fencing club

126.29 --> 133.22
basically doing their thing outside over

130.64 --> 136.32999999999998
at a castle which I walked past which is

133.22 --> 139.1
on that route hmm

136.33 --> 150.05
so I got to Mara coffee with me today

139.1 --> 152.63
and tea that's it I had early lunch but

150.05 --> 155.959
I don't know what it is last few days

152.63 --> 159.56
I've been feeling kind of physically

155.959 --> 163.16
feeble like Bob leash I don't know what

159.56 --> 167.45
it is I don't really feel sick it's like

163.16 --> 171.41
sort of attention and my mind keeps on

167.45 --> 173.29
wandering in directions I sometimes not

171.41 --> 175.64
continually thank God

173.29 --> 177.769
directions I don't want it to and I've

175.64 --> 179.6
been trying to contact my healer but for

177.769 --> 183.62
some reason I can't reach him maybe he's

179.6 --> 188.07999999999998
on a vacation just had his phone turned

183.62 --> 188.08
off I wouldn't be surprised

191.25 --> 202.209
need more food Steve well that's the

195.73 --> 204.97
thing it's like it ate one even properly

202.209 --> 207.79
going I had dinner yesterday like a

204.97 --> 210.519
hamburger as usual but it was kind of

207.79 --> 214.599
late and it just I couldn't finish it

210.519 --> 216.459
I just knew like okay if I'm gonna try

214.599 --> 224.10999999999999
to stuff this in I'm gonna throw up

216.459 --> 228.43
I just it's not like I'm really hungry

224.11 --> 230.29000000000002
or anything I don't know what it is I

228.43 --> 233.17000000000002
can't really explain it anyway

230.29 --> 235.29899999999998
yeah yesterday's hangout was really

233.17 --> 239.85999999999999
interesting to me it kind of blew me

235.299 --> 243.56900000000002
away because at first it just seems like

239.86 --> 247.9
this guy is just another you know

243.569 --> 250.0
prediction and everything oh this but

247.9 --> 252.359
it's not like at least it's not directly

250.0 --> 255.73
an end-of-the-world prediction so I

252.359 --> 258.419
appreciate that about it well he was

255.73 --> 261.09999999999997
like very persistent and he had some

258.419 --> 264.58
numerological connections and I even

261.1 --> 266.83000000000004
watched this video about 25 minutes or

264.58 --> 270.35999999999996
something and it was pretty much the

266.83 --> 276.34
same story kind of exactly the same and

270.36 --> 277.51
I don't know it's it feels really

276.34 --> 280.11999999999995
interesting though

277.51 --> 282.25
I wonder what some others will think

280.12 --> 285.49
about it and for example really curious

282.25 --> 287.97
what Paula thinks about it Bible

285.49 --> 287.97
literalism

290.72 --> 296.25
like is there something to it in some

293.82 --> 300.68
way what are the arguments against it

296.25 --> 303.09
and I have absolutely no oversight over

300.68 --> 305.8
what is involved in all that kind of

303.09 --> 308.91999999999996
thing but she certainly would

305.8 --> 308.92
[Music]

313.15 --> 324.729
right yell at Tia well I wouldn't mind

318.46 --> 328.27
really but I'm just really it feels to

324.729 --> 330.669
me like yeah I am kind of ready for for

328.27 --> 339.60999999999996
a relationship but I'm walking on

330.669 --> 341.74
eggshells because I'm just very it's

339.61 --> 354.52000000000004
very tough to find the right compatible

341.74 --> 356.83
partner for me it is unusual and that I

354.52 --> 360.37
could find anyone that would really suit

356.83 --> 370.63
me and just my intuition pushes me

360.37 --> 375.49
towards types that are just it's I I

370.63 --> 379.229
agree I need to meet somebody but I kind

375.49 --> 386.349
of need the sidestep old habits

379.229 --> 386.919
it might focus and really use what I've

386.349 --> 390.729
become

386.919 --> 394.93
on top of what I used to be to approach

390.729 --> 400.21
a woman with instead of what I used to

394.93 --> 404.94
be just like what yeah my hunger for

400.21 --> 406.15
certain things like I don't know for

404.94 --> 408.639
certain

406.15 --> 412.51
yeah thinks about women not just sex or

408.639 --> 415.66
anything it's just I got very passionate

412.51 --> 417.31
very hungry for interactions when I when

415.66 --> 421.66
I feel really attracted I don't know

417.31 --> 425.38
what it is I'm just a man it's my

421.66 --> 428.25
instincts but they're not always that

425.38 --> 428.25
productive so

430.32 --> 444.87
I'll figure it out when I get there no

436.99 --> 444.87
thanks music man no thanks

447.86 --> 450.999
[Music]

456.47 --> 459.54900000000004
[Music]

470.27 --> 477.4
music man used some kind of troll anyway

477.669 --> 483.56
yeah should even be entertaining this

481.22 --> 485.57000000000005
kind of [ __ ] but I'm gonna look through

483.56 --> 491.84
chat who is here drunken bullet for one

485.57 --> 497.479
one was early in me scan music man into

491.84 --> 507.169
into music of all it was Ronin Fyodor

497.479 --> 512.83
Dostoevsky Steve trace Blythe yell

507.169 --> 512.8299999999999
Atiyah super curve

515.259 --> 523.849
right well maybe you're just in the

518.329 --> 525.3499999999999
trollish mood then music man I don't

523.849 --> 528.74
know why else what you asked me if I

525.35 --> 533.019
want an interview for employment over at

528.74 --> 533.019
all these really

543.31 --> 549.0
okay okay I guess it was a genuine

546.86 --> 552.139
question then

549.0 --> 552.139
[Music]

553.24 --> 562.58
okay the miss Kang well yeah would be

560.09 --> 564.98
very weird to start out demanding they

562.58 --> 568.9100000000001
would leave in Flat Earth I've even

564.98 --> 572.0
heard of it but it all really depends in

568.91 --> 577.61
how they're gonna respond to that if

572.0 --> 579.01
they if she minds that I am like very

577.61 --> 581.84
much tied into it

579.01 --> 584.0
who knows maybe she will find it kind of

581.84 --> 586.82
attractive you know it is interesting

584.0 --> 592.22
and it is something that yeah it's kind

586.82 --> 596.0600000000001
of unique so if it doesn't necessarily

592.22 --> 600.9100000000001
have to be so you must leave like but if

596.06 --> 605.75
they're gonna be extremely pro glower

600.91 --> 607.64
pro glow and all that and have a lot of

605.75 --> 610.75
hobbies basically tying in with that

607.64 --> 610.75
that's gonna be difficult

626.05 --> 628.079
I

639.88 --> 644.28
[Music]

641.06 --> 650.6099999999999
hmm that's a good question Trish billith

644.28 --> 653.4
well that's the thing like how long

650.61 --> 657.42
until she would naturally find out I

653.4 --> 660.3
would look if I'd be saying Leah I for

657.42 --> 662.28
Radio or either YouTube show that I do

660.3 --> 665.04
every day and have a community of people

662.28 --> 669.2099999999999
that I kind of work with that I got to

665.04 --> 672.75
know and it's pretty big and interesting

669.21 --> 677.9100000000001
and science and physics and all kinds of

672.75 --> 680.49
things and if she's still listening then

677.91 --> 682.68
who know she might actually ask like oh

680.49 --> 684.65
yeah what is your channel and I'll show

682.68 --> 688.8299999999999
her and then she'd look and see

684.65 --> 694.77
flattered the early bird so yeah it all

688.83 --> 696.72
depends on their character look and if

694.77 --> 700.23
she's not really gonna care too much

696.72 --> 703.08
about like what I do mentally or

700.23 --> 706.2
whatever then it's also not very likely

703.08 --> 710.94
they'll be interested in a very serious

706.2 --> 714.3900000000001
relationship and then I don't know if I

710.94 --> 717.6800000000001
would be inclined to even share as much

714.39 --> 717.68
you know it all depends

722.5 --> 729.67
right that that's kind of funny that you

726.19 --> 732.0100000000001
say that music man if if the woman is

729.67 --> 740.2299999999999
super hot she can believe what she wants

732.01 --> 743.11
yes and also if a hot woman really wants

740.23 --> 746.77
somebody they'll be inclined to

743.11 --> 749.92
basically really easily act they'll

746.77 --> 752.71
believe whatever the other one believes

749.92 --> 756.64
without being shocked that's also an

752.71 --> 758.83
extra talent that totally smashes the

756.64 --> 761.23
other person and tends to then make them

758.83 --> 763.5600000000001
fall in love because they are convinced

761.23 --> 766.35
oh my god she totally believes me and

763.56 --> 770.9499999999999
finally what I've been looking that

766.35 --> 775.1800000000001
that's also a female skill it's very

770.95 --> 777.9100000000001
tricky I fell for it in the past with

775.18 --> 780.16
things like my ex at the beginning kind

777.91 --> 782.77
of did that with me because it was all

780.16 --> 785.38
over the place I call it totally totally

782.77 --> 789.5799999999999
out there not out there not insane but

785.38 --> 792.52
like very wide too much information not

789.58 --> 797.22
as terrifying or disgusting but just too

792.52 --> 802.27
much data and she would be like yeah wow

797.22 --> 805.4100000000001
you know that's so cool I was just like

802.27 --> 811.12
a home and she's so into me it's just

805.41 --> 813.91
it's a female trick as well and hey guys

811.12 --> 816.07
can kind of do that as well they're like

813.91 --> 818.38
really have the hots for a chick and

816.07 --> 823.6
that chick might be into some kind of

818.38 --> 825.84
bit silly or stupid stuff you hope there

823.6 --> 833.52
might be more but you'll be like oh yeah

825.84 --> 835.72
yeah sure that's cool why not I do that

833.52 --> 838.03
you know but if it's just gonna be that

835.72 --> 842.44
then eventually I'll get bored is [ __ ]

838.03 --> 845.5
just like right what yeah

842.44 --> 848.83
first contact you know you do that kind

845.5 --> 851.7
of stuff everybody that has some skill

848.83 --> 851.7
does that I guess

857.22 --> 867.24
oh right I heard that - Cleary mmm when

864.3 --> 871.5899999999999
was the last time I had a lady well that

867.24 --> 875.79
was my accident really and look that was

871.59 --> 877.83
such a yeah sound so dramatic it now

875.79 --> 882.24
it's not really that romantic anymore

877.83 --> 884.4300000000001
but that was such a disappointment that

882.24 --> 887.34
she broke up with me that I just said

884.43 --> 893.3599999999999
like no screw it I don't want to do this

887.34 --> 895.95
anymore I am just I'm done

893.36 --> 898.53
but yeah I'm not completely done because

895.95 --> 901.3100000000001
I still want children so I can't hold

898.53 --> 901.31
myself to that

905.88 --> 914.1
I don't know maybe it'll weirdly end up

908.58 --> 916.08
eventually just going on continuing on

914.1 --> 918.09
hopefully getting in financial better

916.08 --> 923.3100000000001
positions maybe even getting a more

918.09 --> 926.4300000000001
sensible job angle not as an employee

923.31 --> 929.31
but yeah more structural things that I

926.43 --> 931.02
actually make money out of and then at

929.31 --> 933.6899999999999
some position I could just say okay so

931.02 --> 937.3199999999999
who's interested in having my child and

933.69 --> 942.33
I may just be women that'll be like well

937.32 --> 943.8900000000001
you know what why not and then of course

942.33 --> 946.97
there's going to be conditions and

943.89 --> 949.5
everything and they're not gonna like

946.97 --> 952.3000000000001
LGBT the [ __ ] out of my kid or anything

949.5 --> 955.89
because then it's off the deal is off

952.3 --> 955.89
[Laughter]

961.01 --> 970.65
but I don't know I to me it's still kind

967.38 --> 972.86
of wild I'm hoping I'm already trying to

970.65 --> 975.5699999999999
visualize seeing trying to visualize

972.86 --> 976.5600000000001
yeah based on my own dad's advice

975.57 --> 979.37
towards me

976.56 --> 983.88
it's how he did it with his current wife

979.37 --> 989.01
really having a detailed vision of

983.88 --> 991.49
somebody and then he met her and it was

989.01 --> 994.71
exactly like that even though he thought

991.49 --> 1000.17
first she wasn't but turned out to be

994.71 --> 1003.74
exactly that and I'm I'm hoping maybe I

1000.17 --> 1007.03
will be yeah I'll do it good it out

1003.74 --> 1010.13
there booth I'll be good enough to

1007.03 --> 1012.3199999999999
achieve something similar so I'm kind of

1010.13 --> 1015.64
like hope I'm trying to narrow down my

1012.32 --> 1019.82
focus on what the frequencies would be

1015.64 --> 1022.54
that the right female for me would be

1019.82 --> 1022.5400000000001
subjected to

1025.99 --> 1033.769
and they are gonna be complex people and

1032.439 --> 1036.0790000000002
yeah

1033.769 --> 1040.039
since they're at least gonna be

1036.079 --> 1042.829
attractive definitely above-average it's

1040.039 --> 1046.579
just yeah that's just otherwise not

1042.829 --> 1048.74
gonna work I don't know I feel I'm this

1046.579 --> 1053.21
sounds really stupid but I feel like I'm

1048.74 --> 1057.73
above average and I I just have to do

1053.21 --> 1057.73
that at least and it has to work out and

1058.51 --> 1065.74
the talent has to be compatible I don't

1063.649 --> 1065.7399999999998
know

1068.66 --> 1075.77
maybe I'm being too specific even in my

1072.26 --> 1077.9
approach and it might be more about just

1075.77 --> 1082.34
coincidence in the moment I don't know

1077.9 --> 1085.46
what it is and I'm not a 9-under

1082.34 --> 1092.48
and by the way above average is not nine

1085.46 --> 1095.51
out of ten now my ex was a nine out of

1092.48 --> 1098.419
ten and that was kind of too high aimed

1095.51 --> 1102.309
for me really but I thought I could pull

1098.419 --> 1102.3090000000002
it off no

1119.86 --> 1122.9799999999998
[Music]

1123.669 --> 1128.5900000000001
all right

1125.179 --> 1128.5900000000001
Cheers Nathan

1140.7 --> 1152.249
yeah Ronnie fashi I agree but also

1148.289 --> 1160.499
disagree a little because there is kind

1152.249 --> 1162.359
of a charm it's like if somebody's hot

1160.499 --> 1165.029
they have to have a little spice to them

1162.359 --> 1166.559
you know but not constantly because that

1165.029 --> 1173.059
it would just be a pain

1166.559 --> 1173.059
yeah nobody should be a total dick

1204.6 --> 1207.1689999999999
yeah

1208.64 --> 1214.6100000000001
that's funny Cleary moved to Texas you

1212.48 --> 1221.48
can find a little lady there I bet I

1214.61 --> 1224.9799999999998
could let's just say seriously the

1221.48 --> 1233.8990000000001
thought has crossed my mind like America

1224.98 --> 1236.38
but I don't know I'm looking for a rare

1233.899 --> 1236.3799999999999
species

1254.309 --> 1261.029
yeah yeah yeah

1258.349 --> 1263.9399999999998
uhmm you think so

1261.029 --> 1266.419
well guess what I did that to test it

1263.94 --> 1271.1290000000001
and yeah I thought it was disgusting

1266.419 --> 1271.1290000000001
so why are you bringing that up

1284.96 --> 1287.96
mm-hmm

1289.13 --> 1294.91
all right well that's what QE usually

1292.669 --> 1294.91
does so

1321.79 --> 1324.79
yeah

1328.7 --> 1335.45
well you know what I'm talking about

1332.889 --> 1338.119
chicks that would be good with flat

1335.45 --> 1342.32
earth and all that what I think would be

1338.119 --> 1344.869
really hot but that's something so I

1342.32 --> 1346.879
don't they I don't expect anything to be

1344.869 --> 1350.029
out there like that would be a chick

1346.879 --> 1355.2199999999998
that I just find really hot that has the

1350.029 --> 1358.309
right speech type that wouldn't have a

1355.22 --> 1361.609
terrible terrible Dutch accent basically

1358.309 --> 1365.359
that would be nice they when they talk

1361.609 --> 1369.58
to English and what I think would be

1365.359 --> 1376.129
really hot is if they could just like me

1369.58 --> 1379.309
be dynamic in their thinking and be a

1376.129 --> 1380.7099999999998
Cosmo genius basically just like I am

1379.309 --> 1383.4189999999999
and that they could definitely

1380.71 --> 1386.239
understand presuppositional mechanisms

1383.419 --> 1389.1490000000001
concerning the the globe model and

1386.239 --> 1391.82
everything but that they could do the

1389.149 --> 1396.2489999999998
same thing with the Flat Earth as well

1391.82 --> 1401.09
just like I have that would be amazing I

1396.249 --> 1402.859
would be stunned by that but yeah if a

1401.09 --> 1405.379
girl like that would be hard enough to

1402.859 --> 1407.4499999999998
me that I think that if they'd even just

1405.379 --> 1413.1789999999999
arrived on the scene it pearl but she'd

1407.45 --> 1415.73
probably blow everyone away so I wonder

1413.179 --> 1419.299
if there would be a girl out there if

1415.73 --> 1424.039
I'd even have a chance to to get there I

1419.299 --> 1427.309
don't know who knows maybe a girl like

1424.039 --> 1430.73
that will run into me and try to use me

1427.309 --> 1436.07
as a as a stepping stool and ask me like

1430.73 --> 1440.44
hey can ya introduce me to the scene and

1436.07 --> 1440.4399999999998
I'll do it who knows

1457.22 --> 1462.6200000000001
all right yeah yeah David reads yeah the

1460.82 --> 1467.06
towers yeah I really like that

1462.62 --> 1470.11
presentation yesterday I think Randy

1467.06 --> 1474.2
brought it forth was really good

1470.11 --> 1477.5
that how far away the towers could be

1474.2 --> 1481.01
seen it's just such a basic point well

1477.5 --> 1485.74
no wait it wasn't seen it was how far

1481.01 --> 1488.78
the for the transmitter would reach and

1485.74 --> 1492.02
there were supposed to be relays used

1488.78 --> 1493.73
but then that person didn't use a relay

1492.02 --> 1499.46
just had a direct connection over

1493.73 --> 1502.25
extreme distance and I thought like the

1499.46 --> 1503.77
newspaper or whatever they'd like yet

1502.25 --> 1507.53
don't talk about that

1503.77 --> 1510.46
that was amazing yeah I saw that part

1507.53 --> 1510.46
that was really cool

1525.76 --> 1532.47
I'm pretty sure Trish bliss that was

1528.34 --> 1532.47
mentioned that there were no relays used

1550.36 --> 1552.99
yeah

1578.83 --> 1586.76
mm-hmm

1581.57 --> 1586.76
yeah it is a bit noisy isn't he I

1587.78 --> 1595.1
thought he was a troll at first your Xin

1592.71 --> 1595.1000000000001
whatever

1600.129 --> 1611.07
apparently you is just a trollish guy an

1606.789 --> 1611.07
obese guy called Sam okay

1619.02 --> 1621.98
all right

1627.87 --> 1632.35
[Music]

1630.01 --> 1637.09
yeah I by the way I have been looking a

1632.35 --> 1639.549
little in the Google Mead system which

1637.09 --> 1641.59
is the one that Jose is using but

1639.549 --> 1645.85
apparently you have to actually register

1641.59 --> 1648.87
a a website and a business for that

1645.85 --> 1654.549
that was weird I didn't expect all that

1648.87 --> 1660.58
so I'm not sure if I'll get there quite

1654.549 --> 1663.6399999999999
soon maybe by now just as a as an anchor

1660.58 --> 1671.29
for for a media representation of myself

1663.64 --> 1677.7
I need like an arwing website like our

1671.29 --> 1677.7
wind calm for all our in related media

1684.35 --> 1689.4189999999999
what Jose uses sound Li's account are

1688.58 --> 1700.269
you serious

1689.419 --> 1700.269
Ronnie fashi huh okay I didn't know that

1704.909 --> 1712.5390000000002
anyway yeah do you guys have any

1709.84 --> 1715.8999999999999
feedback by the way on the guy that came

1712.539 --> 1719.98
on yesterday talking about his biblical

1715.9 --> 1724.24
prediction about the return of Christ

1719.98 --> 1725.919
basically because just yeah I've been

1724.24 --> 1729.01
wondering about that and just really

1725.919 --> 1731.25
curious what what you guys think about

1729.01 --> 1731.25
that

1739.47 --> 1742.47
okay

1744.87 --> 1749.9089999999999
yeah Roger MCE

1747.07 --> 1749.9089999999999
you would say that

1752.79 --> 1757.43
[Music]

1769.85 --> 1776.11
yes unicorn laser eyes he specifically

1773.99 --> 1785.2
said that was the funny thing about it

1776.11 --> 1788.1999999999998
April 5th 2021 if I'm not mistaken the

1785.2 --> 1788.2
misremembering

1802.95 --> 1810.14
or was it August 5th ah terrible at this

1847.88 --> 1854.99
right well unicorn laser eyes what he

1850.7 --> 1858.47
specifically said was you he will return

1854.99 --> 1860.419
as a thief in the night so he basically

1858.47 --> 1864.7
said it's not gonna come during the day

1860.419 --> 1868.8090000000002
it's gonna be during a three-day

1864.7 --> 1873.679
blackout of the Sun that's what he said

1868.809 --> 1875.539
and then there were more things that he

1873.679 --> 1877.97
tied into that he said yeah during these

1875.539 --> 1880.9089999999999
three days you can't eat or drink

1877.97 --> 1884.2
anything and you have to wear special

1880.909 --> 1887.99
tight linen clothes was kind of weird

1884.2 --> 1893.179
and then suggested that yeah you would

1887.99 --> 1896.059
visit Jesus Christ that way unless you

1893.179 --> 1898.1200000000001
were too poor it was very specific so he

1896.059 --> 1905.2
had thought it out very carefully

1898.12 --> 1905.1999999999998
referencing Torah things I think but I

1906.37 --> 1916.1589999999999
don't know it it did kind of make sense

1913.15 --> 1920.89
in a way sort of it kind of worked out

1916.159 --> 1920.89
with the whole story to me but

1923.84 --> 1929.27
that's why I'm curious what you guys

1925.76 --> 1934.18
think about it all right Book of

1929.27 --> 1934.18
Revelations right

1963.08 --> 1968.809
now but yeah Trish Blythe he may have

1966.83 --> 1970.46
all quoted things from the Bible but

1968.809 --> 1972.83
it's his train of thoughts

1970.46 --> 1978.8890000000001
it's his construction that he's making

1972.83 --> 1987.039
out of it that's what I that's why I

1978.889 --> 1987.039
said his thoughts this train of thinking

2004.46 --> 2010.009
yeah unicorn laser eyes that was exactly

2007.22 --> 2017.99
my argument you know all these

2010.009 --> 2021.59
predictions but yeah would it be wise to

2017.99 --> 2026.809
completely say no because so many times

2021.59 --> 2030.1899999999998
false it can never be true or would it

2026.809 --> 2034.249
just be sensible to say okay well maybe

2030.19 --> 2036.95
we'd find out wouldn't we certainly the

2034.249 --> 2041.24
Sun blacks out for three days oh yeah I

2036.95 --> 2046.3400000000001
think that the world will know so then

2041.24 --> 2048.74
there may be something to it and hey if

2046.34 --> 2051.19
it doesn't happen then what's the issue

2048.74 --> 2051.1899999999996
really

2083.44 --> 2088.96
all right yeah Trish Blythe yeah that's

2086.08 --> 2091.0
the interesting thing about it what you

2088.96 --> 2094.48
said that's right get prepared anyway

2091.0 --> 2099.73
because the whole setup just felt like a

2094.48 --> 2103.84
test like a test of Christ and it's good

2099.73 --> 2107.5
to be prepared that that could happen to

2103.84 --> 2109.57
not wander off and then get caught in

2107.5 --> 2112.0
the wrong moment basically like that and

2109.57 --> 2114.52
that's kind of what that whole set up

2112.0 --> 2117.34
that he presented that's what the

2114.52 --> 2120.61
frequency the energy the direction of it

2117.34 --> 2124.7200000000003
was it's like a test and based telling

2120.61 --> 2129.82
you like you know be be prepared and

2124.72 --> 2132.8399999999997
that was kind of appealing in my opinion

2129.82 --> 2132.84
it felt appealing

2139.5 --> 2144.99
Oh although I don't know like where

2142.17 --> 2147.54
would I get a linen clothes set that's

2144.99 --> 2150.18
gonna be the special request I guess

2147.54 --> 2156.0
like okay I guess I have to get all in

2150.18 --> 2156.69
and clothing now hmm I thought I was

2156.0 --> 2165.39
kind of weird

2156.69 --> 2167.94
I bought fasting for a period I could do

2165.39 --> 2173.0989999999997
that although I don't know if I could do

2167.94 --> 2175.9500000000003
completely without drinking water but I

2173.099 --> 2178.0800000000004
don't know maybe during that time the

2175.95 --> 2181.109
general conditions of the world will

2178.08 --> 2185.2799999999997
work differently maybe it'll be like a

2181.109 --> 2189.18
weird dark world crossover period where

2185.28 --> 2195.9300000000003
things work differently and where you

2189.18 --> 2200.22
don't need to eat maybe like the the the

2195.93 --> 2202.89
normal earthly needs who actually not

2200.22 --> 2205.98
will be suppressed or something you

2202.89 --> 2209.58
don't need that maybe it'll be like that

2205.98 --> 2211.77
and that would be then okay if you then

2209.58 --> 2215.31
get caught eating or whatever it's gonna

2211.77 --> 2219.99
be purely your lust or your something

2215.31 --> 2223.02
like that and then that'll poison the

2219.99 --> 2226.9199999999996
spirit and apparently make you an

2223.02 --> 2229.74
outcast or yeah make you fail the test

2226.92 --> 2233.67
that that's kind of what I think caught

2229.74 --> 2236.0699999999997
from it so who knows maybe indeed if

2233.67 --> 2239.25
that will happen I'll basically say okay

2236.07 --> 2242.119
I got water here I got food here I'm

2239.25 --> 2245.609
just not gonna think about that and just

2242.119 --> 2248.1600000000003
hope that yeah I won't just die of

2245.609 --> 2250.3489999999997
thirst and I'll just go stay on the

2248.16 --> 2254.0699999999997
right frequency pray a lot meditate

2250.349 --> 2260.82
whatever and then hey maybe it'll work

2254.07 --> 2263.28
or maybe I will get like help and yeah

2260.82 --> 2265.8900000000003
if my instincts then take over and don't

2263.28 --> 2267.869
want to let me die of thirst because

2265.89 --> 2270.54
that's not happening what I thought

2267.869 --> 2275.9700000000003
would happen earlier then I'll just go

2270.54 --> 2279.63
and get a sip anyway and risk that who

2275.97 --> 2281.91
knows maybe like totally different stuff

2279.63 --> 2285.81
is gonna happen and this is also

2281.91 --> 2288.089
extremely presuppositional but I do find

2285.81 --> 2291.57
it interesting also again because I have

2288.089 --> 2294.06
dark road related vision experiences

2291.57 --> 2295.32
that do kind of mention that that the

2294.06 --> 2300.68
three days

2295.32 --> 2304.4700000000003
the Sun I've seen that three dark days

2300.68 --> 2308.22
it was super surreal and like the dark

2304.47 --> 2310.3199999999997
ones that tried to screw me over in that

2308.22 --> 2313.23
vision even tried to suggest like it

2310.32 --> 2315.36
would go out forever there was also a

2313.23 --> 2318.51
mind trick but I fell for it back at the

2315.36 --> 2321.51
time and it was a terrible idea like oh

2318.51 --> 2323.73
my god how was humanity how's life gonna

2321.51 --> 2325.8900000000003
survive without the Sun and so I got

2323.73 --> 2328.8
like falsely preoccupied with that in my

2325.89 --> 2331.5
mind for a long time and that's been

2328.8 --> 2335.3700000000003
going on until I figured out what their

2331.5 --> 2337.73
vision really was and how it was off how

2335.37 --> 2341.52
a lot of it was basically mind tricks

2337.73 --> 2344.9900000000002
where I was fooled to carry on believing

2341.52 --> 2344.99
something that wasn't true

2361.67 --> 2366.529
Chris Matt that's a weird question have

2364.73 --> 2371.569
you ever heard of the dark night of the

2366.529 --> 2376.22
soul that does weirdly ring familiar I I

2371.569 --> 2379.91
don't know what is the context is that

2376.22 --> 2384.549
like ritual or philosophy or what what

2379.91 --> 2384.549
is that supposed to be the novel

2425.359 --> 2428.2889999999998
hmm

2429.32 --> 2437.44
okay that sounds eerily familiar

2434.51 --> 2437.44
Chris Matt

2445.62 --> 2449.75
where have you heard that from

2489.99 --> 2498.6299999999997
it sounds incredibly familiar you didn't

2495.54 --> 2500.8089999999997
Chris Matt Wow okay how how did you do

2498.63 --> 2500.809
that

2537.89 --> 2540.52
huh

2541.76 --> 2544.69
okay

2544.97 --> 2551.56
so you meditated on that that sounds

2548.78 --> 2551.5600000000004
pretty weird

2570.65 --> 2577.88
I'm pretty sure that I didn't meditate

2573.23 --> 2581.539
on that for months so if I went through

2577.88 --> 2588.7690000000002
that and then might just have I probably

2581.539 --> 2591.7690000000002
did it very rushed like I was with it I

2588.769 --> 2594.799
had a lot of energy so I could just like

2591.769 --> 2598.64
manipulate my own mind quite easily it

2594.799 --> 2601.269
was very dangerous potentially and I

2598.64 --> 2606.769
think I just like threw off the shield

2601.269 --> 2610.549
just threw it down and that's how I just

2606.769 --> 2613.359
entered it pretty quickly I think that's

2610.549 --> 2618.609
what happened it was during the whole

2613.359 --> 2618.609
yeah in involvement with those people

2629.13 --> 2632.06
okay

2643.07 --> 2645.8500000000004
hmm

2656.82 --> 2659.75
that's interesting

2660.63 --> 2668.55
because what you're describing I've I

2664.07 --> 2670.44
didn't consciously learn that but retro

2668.55 --> 2674.2400000000002
actively I seem to have learned that

2670.44 --> 2677.43
from my vision experiences because as

2674.24 --> 2680.0099999999998
I've tried to describe those visions I

2677.43 --> 2682.35
was literally seemed to have been with

2680.01 --> 2685.4700000000003
my consciousness in a sub layer of my

2682.35 --> 2687.38
consciousness where elements of my own

2685.47 --> 2691.68
character seemed to be their own

2687.38 --> 2694.83
personification like pieces of me were

2691.68 --> 2696.5099999999998
addressing me but I didn't I wasn't I

2694.83 --> 2700.47
was confused in that state wasn't

2696.51 --> 2709.98
totally aware that they were potentially

2700.47 --> 2712.62
parts of me but in retrospect yeah

2709.98 --> 2716.67
that's definitely been there like

2712.62 --> 2720.2999999999997
there's just elements of my mind that

2716.67 --> 2724.14
are trying to control me and they were

2720.3 --> 2729.0800000000004
personified but it seems that in just

2724.14 --> 2732.35
how I responded to it all basically

2729.08 --> 2736.74
resisting much of it much of those

2732.35 --> 2738.9
thoughts you could say in that I've kind

2736.74 --> 2740.91
of like succeeded through the whole

2738.9 --> 2743.57
thing through the trial I think that's

2740.91 --> 2750.54
why I still am a person and not just a

2743.57 --> 2751.32
drone now what the real conscious lesson

2750.54 --> 2755.7
has come

2751.32 --> 2760.71
much much afterward so it's not in the

2755.7 --> 2762.9199999999996
same type of yeah linear conscious

2760.71 --> 2767.07
experiences as you seem to have

2762.92 --> 2771.98
underwent it from what I from what I've

2767.07 --> 2771.98
understood so far Chris Matt

2808.48 --> 2811.23
right

2820.51 --> 2827.98
hmm right yes so it is really like a

2825.67 --> 2832.21
metaphysical experience of an inner

2827.98 --> 2834.46
monologue makes sense if you would open

2832.21 --> 2837.31
your third eye what that is it's

2834.46 --> 2842.53
basically trying to make you transcend

2837.31 --> 2844.95
what is going on so yeah the first thing

2842.53 --> 2849.19
you would get to see is your own

2844.95 --> 2851.89
gatekeeping how you are preventing

2849.19 --> 2854.89
yourself from getting the full picture

2851.89 --> 2857.74
by the programming you've led on to you

2854.89 --> 2860.74
and yeah that is what would be revealed

2857.74 --> 2863.29
in such a moment it is what was revealed

2860.74 --> 2865.4199999999996
to me during those vision experiences

2863.29 --> 2867.55
when I was not ready for it and

2865.42 --> 2872.14
basically didn't really learn the lesson

2867.55 --> 2877.1800000000003
when I came out of it I was just crushed

2872.14 --> 2880.7999999999997
by it mostly but now afterwards I have

2877.18 --> 2880.7999999999997
learned it much later

2893.03 --> 2896.0890000000004
[Music]

2913.0 --> 2921.869
yeah yeah sorry for the long silence is

2916.9 --> 2921.869
just just thinking about all this and

2926.61 --> 2931.86
it's really fascinating how it works

2929.12 --> 2934.1099999999997
when you're trying to achieve like the

2931.86 --> 2936.7200000000003
next level in consciousness or like

2934.11 --> 2939.51
could be conceived as going to the fifth

2936.72 --> 2942.3599999999997
i mentioning the fifth dimension or

2939.51 --> 2946.5200000000004
opening up your third eye or that but

2942.36 --> 2949.92
that's always going to be an idea

2946.52 --> 2954.93
formulated constructed within the

2949.92 --> 2959.46
typical normal culture framework of the

2954.93 --> 2963.29
mind how people express their ideas and

2959.46 --> 2968.19
conceptualize their ideas and it it can

2963.29 --> 2971.61
that cannot really properly express what

2968.19 --> 2974.91
actually is that's happening in such a

2971.61 --> 2980.1600000000003
moment because the transcendence element

2974.91 --> 2983.25
you can't be told what it is you can

2980.16 --> 2990.48
only experience it and then you really

2983.25 --> 2992.82
see it it's like the matrix they said

2990.48 --> 2999.14
something you can't be told what the

2992.82 --> 3003.4100000000003
matrix is you have to experience it and

2999.14 --> 3005.18
that is really ascendance you have to

3003.41 --> 3007.31
see through it you have to actually

3005.18 --> 3011.18
touch it with your own consciousness you

3007.31 --> 3013.0099999999998
can't be can't be translated to you you

3011.18 --> 3018.14
have to go there with your mind you

3013.01 --> 3020.75
can't have something bring what that is

3018.14 --> 3022.7
like to your mind in your current mind

3020.75 --> 3025.3
state you have to go there with your

3022.7 --> 3027.71
mind because it's never gonna translate

3025.3 --> 3030.19
into what the experience is actually

3027.71 --> 3030.19
like

3033.53 --> 3041.3300000000004
no no P Mars thanks I know

3079.26 --> 3086.0400000000004
yeah more color that's I kind of agree

3082.58 --> 3088.619
everything everyone has negative and

3086.04 --> 3095.64
positive in them it's all bound by the

3088.619 --> 3098.52
ego either either parts and when things

3095.64 --> 3100.8199999999997
get to still an opposition starts to

3098.52 --> 3104.73
form so if things get too good

3100.82 --> 3110.1600000000003
then suddenly longing the ego starts

3104.73 --> 3116.19
still one of the ruin it and when things

3110.16 --> 3119.0099999999998
are too shitty and too terrible then the

3116.19 --> 3122.09
ego will start to become obsessed with

3119.01 --> 3127.7000000000003
getting trying to get away from that and

3122.09 --> 3131.4
somehow recreate something pure somehow

3127.7 --> 3134.48
might not really work out but that's it

3131.4 --> 3141.359
it's what happens there's always a dual

3134.48 --> 3143.91
effect within every person it's yeah in

3141.359 --> 3145.89
a way it's also what I tried to say is

3143.91 --> 3150.27
like yeah if everything just seems to be

3145.89 --> 3152.2999999999997
going so well so great then that can be

3150.27 --> 3155.25
considered kind of like a bad sign

3152.3 --> 3158.01
metaphysically because then you're gonna

3155.25 --> 3164.119
have to need to deal with everything

3158.01 --> 3169.71
being great and not yeah and with stands

3164.119 --> 3172.44
seductions from that point and depending

3169.71 --> 3174.39
on how good you are at it you may be

3172.44 --> 3178.28
able to deal with that very easily or

3174.39 --> 3181.41
you have a lot of trouble with that I

3178.28 --> 3185.9900000000002
myself have had a lot of trouble with

3181.41 --> 3185.99
that so I'm very

3187.98 --> 3195.7400000000002
I see it on the edge about when things

3192.81 --> 3195.74
are going really good

3198.17 --> 3203.42
because I've been fooled in the past

3200.609 --> 3206.73
when when that happens and I don't want

3203.42 --> 3210.589
ya don't want to make the same type of

3206.73 --> 3213.26
mistakes yeah

3210.589 --> 3216.57
but because of that also

3213.26 --> 3219.0600000000004
it's almost automated that if things go

3216.57 --> 3223.4100000000003
really well then there's like an inner

3219.06 --> 3227.52
sabotage because it's a fail-safe

3223.41 --> 3232.74
mechanism I I guess but it's not really

3227.52 --> 3236.599
nice to have that on the other hand it's

3232.74 --> 3239.9399999999996
better not to get out of control in

3236.599 --> 3243.839
mania and get all drunk on the glory

3239.94 --> 3250.02
because that's yeah again that creates

3243.839 --> 3253.44
that risk setting and I seem to have

3250.02 --> 3255.109
developed a counter effect in my ego to

3253.44 --> 3262.7400000000002
basically prevent that from happening

3255.109 --> 3266.22
and for now I'm gonna leave it there but

3262.74 --> 3268.43
I need to I need to be able to handle it

3266.22 --> 3268.43
though

3274.24 --> 3280.87
I guess it's kind of like a stick behind

3278.02 --> 3292.23
the door as they say it just forces me

3280.87 --> 3292.23
to keep on moving and that's good so

3299.47 --> 3305.0099999999998
ha

3301.59 --> 3309.7400000000002
well I talked to me Cleary a Dark

3305.01 --> 3314.3100000000004
Passenger and need an exorcism well no

3309.74 --> 3315.99
look there and I even said at the

3314.31 --> 3318.36
beginning of the show yeah I wish I

3315.99 --> 3322.08
could talk to my healer because maybe

3318.36 --> 3323.78
there is like a tag there I do feel like

3322.08 --> 3327.5699999999997
there are some kind of Romanian

3323.78 --> 3329.7900000000004
influences like depression like elements

3327.57 --> 3333.51
that are not supposed to be there in my

3329.79 --> 3336.0299999999997
opinion that yeah

3333.51 --> 3337.8
seem to be external so I want to get rid

3336.03 --> 3342.2400000000002
of that but that's nothing like a real

3337.8 --> 3344.67
possession or anything it's just I'm not

3342.24 --> 3346.6499999999996
really worried about it because I'm

3344.67 --> 3349.58
still just following the principles I'm

3346.65 --> 3349.58
not doing anything crazy

3358.17 --> 3366.15
and yeah praying to Jesus Christ

3361.349 --> 3366.539
it does actually help when I feel like

3366.15 --> 3374.789
that

3366.539 --> 3377.1800000000003
and I do that I will Jeremy Bennett good

3374.789 --> 3377.1800000000003
morning

3388.97 --> 3399.0899999999997
all right so enough about all that

3395.93 --> 3399.0899999999997
[Music]

3400.91 --> 3408.67
see something interesting yesterday that

3405.62 --> 3408.67
I haven't mentioned yet

3412.59 --> 3417.67
hmm

3414.74 --> 3420.4399999999996
all right yeah now I noticed that

3417.67 --> 3422.81
Jeffrey Epstein was arrested by Trump

3420.44 --> 3427.63
apparently even Owen Benjamin made a

3422.81 --> 3427.63
video with that title huh

3428.109 --> 3434.7799999999997
yeah and it's also lift a veil

3432.53 --> 3441.02
man I mean I totally missed out on that

3434.78 --> 3442.849
yesterday for some reason but okay I

3441.02 --> 3447.02
guess that's happening I'll try to catch

3442.849 --> 3449.65
up on on that situation but yeah at

3447.02 --> 3449.65
least it's something

3461.53 --> 3468.46
right that's that's true Chris Matt yeah

3465.55 --> 3471.1000000000004
I'd like to respond to that before I ran

3468.46 --> 3473.95
out to show like Chris Matt says you are

3471.1 --> 3476.62
the creator in your own life you choose

3473.95 --> 3478.87
how you feel about reality do not allow

3476.62 --> 3482.56
the outside world to control you it's

3478.87 --> 3487.72
absolutely true but on the other hand

3482.56 --> 3491.29
there seem to be inherent influences

3487.72 --> 3493.0299999999997
that come from me that arrived in my

3491.29 --> 3495.55
consciousness through myself

3493.03 --> 3497.7400000000002
not through outsider suggesting it to it

3495.55 --> 3501.13
although they did try to manipulate me

3497.74 --> 3504.97
with my own feelings attaching more

3501.13 --> 3511.09
things to it when I was younger but I do

3504.97 --> 3513.8199999999997
have also negative feelings toward the

3511.09 --> 3520.92
world that naturally arrive it's like a

3513.82 --> 3520.92
combination of disappointment and

3524.0 --> 3528.26
yeah it's mostly just disappointment

3526.13 --> 3530.63
that get in can get into anger and all

3528.26 --> 3533.78
that and that was there from a very

3530.63 --> 3536.57
young age and it is also partially

3533.78 --> 3541.1600000000003
because my intellect intellectual

3536.57 --> 3543.4100000000003
insight awoken very young so I was

3541.16 --> 3546.29
literally staring and trying to

3543.41 --> 3548.2999999999997
communicate get along with people that

3546.29 --> 3551.63
were all in this sounds horrible that

3548.3 --> 3555.4700000000003
were all below me and I felt isolated

3551.63 --> 3558.08
I felt like I couldn't do anything it's

3555.47 --> 3560.6899999999996
just like yeah just do really stupid

3558.08 --> 3566.81
shitty things that are not challenging

3560.69 --> 3569.54
I felt locked in and and those things

3566.81 --> 3573.14
that I experienced together have yeah

3569.54 --> 3575.9
put this reflection of the world in me

3573.14 --> 3578.24
that does say like yet though a lot of

3575.9 --> 3580.94
the world is really shitty and people

3578.24 --> 3585.859
are really freaking [ __ ] even the

3580.94 --> 3587.9
good ones yeah like and even the really

3585.859 --> 3590.48
smart people have really freaking

3587.9 --> 3593.78
[ __ ] moments or elements about them

3590.48 --> 3595.64
like corners in in the whole spectrum of

3593.78 --> 3599.48
things where for some freaking reason

3595.64 --> 3602.24
they told they turn total retards in

3599.48 --> 3604.52
that aspect unresolved issues and then

3602.24 --> 3606.68
childish behavior start all that and

3604.52 --> 3610.13
everybody has it and everybody's an

3606.68 --> 3613.64
idiot basically and then I figure it out

3610.13 --> 3618.71
as I went along oh [ __ ] I'm a freaking

3613.64 --> 3620.66
idiot - yeah so now I can think about

3618.71 --> 3622.82
the whole world is like okay everybody's

3620.66 --> 3625.5499999999997
just freaking [ __ ] and I'm [ __ ]

3622.82 --> 3628.1600000000003
and look we just endlessly back and

3625.55 --> 3634.3390000000004
forth about [ __ ] and never getting

3628.16 --> 3636.5299999999997
anywhere but at the same time well this

3634.339 --> 3638.7799999999997
seems to be like a framework of just

3636.53 --> 3643.55
okay there's a lot of garbage out there

3638.78 --> 3645.71
and if it really is a lot of it but at

3643.55 --> 3648.44
the same time there's also just every

3645.71 --> 3652.88
time in between the garbage

3648.44 --> 3654.89
there's always something unique or kind

3652.88 --> 3657.2400000000002
of interesting that can be found in

3654.89 --> 3660.24
between it also have

3657.24 --> 3662.3399999999997
time and it almost gives the garbage

3660.24 --> 3666.4199999999996
value because sometimes she wanted wood

3662.34 --> 3669.51
that those unique things even come up if

3666.42 --> 3674.9
the world wasn't in this garbage state

3669.51 --> 3674.9
human wise you know it gets really weird

3676.34 --> 3682.71
so yeah it's just it's there I don't

3680.76 --> 3684.9300000000003
think it's external I don't think it is

3682.71 --> 3687.75
a demon inside of me that's like oh yeah

3684.93 --> 3690.1499999999996
hate the world hate you will know those

3687.75 --> 3693.15
influences are definitely out there as

3690.15 --> 3697.26
soon as you unleash that kind of feeling

3693.15 --> 3699.51
and let it rage yeah immediately things

3697.26 --> 3702.3
on the outside be it spirits or be it

3699.51 --> 3705.9300000000003
media things will reach out and say oh

3702.3 --> 3711.1800000000003
yeah Oh we'll all so much sites to show

3705.93 --> 3715.89
you you know that'll happen oh yeah but

3711.18 --> 3717.69
the the actual feeling response the the

3715.89 --> 3719.22
feeling relation with the world that's

3717.69 --> 3725.55
genuine that's me that's my

3719.22 --> 3727.74
consciousness but I'm not gonna make

3725.55 --> 3731.04
that into a one directional blame

3727.74 --> 3733.7099999999996
situations because as I said as I grew

3731.04 --> 3737.64
up I also figured out that I myself am

3733.71 --> 3741.09
just as [ __ ] I just try to handle my

3737.64 --> 3743.37
own human retardation as well as I can

3741.09 --> 3745.77
and like really fix the problem almost

3743.37 --> 3749.58
like desperately trying to hide my own

3745.77 --> 3750.96
human [ __ ] ET like like yeah I made a

3749.58 --> 3753.72
mistake when I corrected really quickly

3750.96 --> 3764.25
so it's not really done that kind of

3753.72 --> 3768.9599999999996
[ __ ] this is getting really weird but ya

3764.25 --> 3774.24
know I I have negative in feelings but

3768.96 --> 3778.38
it's not really hatred or rage all of

3774.24 --> 3782.04
that really comes from well what I think

3778.38 --> 3785.1
that hatred is is love and answer is

3782.04 --> 3786.99
it's locked out love it's something you

3785.1 --> 3789.45
want that you can't and then it turns

3786.99 --> 3790.6899999999996
bitter then it turns into ruin and you

3789.45 --> 3794.1699999999996
just want to get it out

3790.69 --> 3796.9
way but you wouldn't want to get it out

3794.17 --> 3798.4500000000003
of the way if you had no feelings for it

3796.9 --> 3801.78
to begin with

3798.45 --> 3804.609
see and that's why I think hate is

3801.78 --> 3807.8190000000004
basically love an answer to our love

3804.609 --> 3815.47
locked out and it turns into rage and

3807.819 --> 3819.97
hatred but I don't do that because I

3815.47 --> 3825.1899999999996
start out now with everyone accepting

3819.97 --> 3826.99
like oh my god people and by default I

3825.19 --> 3830.109
just accept their [ __ ] because

3826.99 --> 3831.97
they're humans and I'm gonna have to

3830.109 --> 3834.25
accept as I approach them that I am

3831.97 --> 3838.089
[ __ ] too and that they will probably

3834.25 --> 3846.16
get to see parts of my retardation see

3838.089 --> 3848.859
this weird isn't it but yeah in that

3846.16 --> 3851.97
sense retardation has become a really an

3848.859 --> 3854.8489999999997
overgeneralization it's rather just the

3851.97 --> 3857.2
mechanical floors of our own psychology

3854.849 --> 3861.01
psychological systems the inherent

3857.2 --> 3867.1299999999997
nature to corrupt to lie to ourselves

3861.01 --> 3869.9500000000003
the infinitely complex ability to lie to

3867.13 --> 3871.7400000000002
ourselves especially is probably at the

3869.95 --> 3876.79
core of all this

3871.74 --> 3879.3999999999996
it's a massive tool to be able to do

3876.79 --> 3882.099
that but it's also the biggest mind trap

3879.4 --> 3885.13
for yourself ever it's it's the biggest

3882.099 --> 3888.04
enslavement to ever lying to yourself

3885.13 --> 3891.73
and humans are full of it and it's been

3888.04 --> 3895.869
bred into us culturally over over the

3891.73 --> 3897.97
decades so it's getting worse and that's

3895.869 --> 3903.4500000000003
why everybody seems to be delusional and

3897.97 --> 3907.45
why so many people now just settle for

3903.45 --> 3909.1899999999996
obvious delusion because yeah it's kind

3907.45 --> 3912.7
of in the right direction it kind of

3909.19 --> 3915.069
looks good if you really look at it

3912.7 --> 3917.0499999999997
critically it's a mess it's absolutely

3915.069 --> 3918.97
[ __ ] but yeah everything is like

3917.05 --> 3920.13
that now so just go with this because

3918.97 --> 3924.29
it's silent

3920.13 --> 3927.3900000000003
right and I catch myself even doing this

3924.29 --> 3930.9
are not conspiracies

3927.39 --> 3933.6299999999997
for example with media I'll just say

3930.9 --> 3935.31
like oh yeah this media is doing this

3933.63 --> 3937.4300000000003
but I'll still look because there's

3935.31 --> 3942.29
still something interesting there and

3937.43 --> 3942.29
then I just allow myself to be subjected

3943.79 --> 3946.79
yeah

3955.84 --> 3963.73
yeah thanks thanks yeah thanks for the

3959.26 --> 3965.4700000000003
good responses isn't it it's a good

3963.73 --> 3967.54
thing to talk about it's pretty complex

3965.47 --> 3971.29
too by the way talk about when you're

3967.54 --> 3973.0299999999997
just by yourself but I thought it was

3971.29 --> 3976.2599999999998
yeah it's important it's a part of me

3973.03 --> 3979.51
and whenever I have dissatisfaction

3976.26 --> 3982.36
about people or again like all stupid

3979.51 --> 3985.92
humans why do they always say that's not

3982.36 --> 3988.96
some demon that's hiding in our when I

3985.92 --> 3992.2000000000003
can come out I hate everyone no that's

3988.96 --> 3995.02
that's not an external thing no that is

3992.2 --> 3997.7799999999997
really me and that frustration has

3995.02 --> 4000.2599999999998
always been there and it's been a big

3997.78 --> 4003.96
challenge to basically deal with that

4000.26 --> 4006.3900000000003
but I yeah at the recognition of it and

4003.96 --> 4009.03
the kind of forced acceptance it's

4006.39 --> 4013.77
always also given some opportunity

4009.03 --> 4016.32
because it all also reveals how much

4013.77 --> 4018.66
more dynamic because of the natural

4016.32 --> 4021.42
retardation of humans and the acceptance

4018.66 --> 4025.35
of it how much more dynamic people have

4021.42 --> 4031.4300000000003
also become in adapting unreasonably so

4025.35 --> 4031.43
but they have and I can use that

4031.58 --> 4036.9
everything and everyone is using that I

4034.01 --> 4039.57
don't want to abuse that I can use that

4036.9 --> 4044.7000000000003
that is there but I first have to accept

4039.57 --> 4048.75
that it is there and then then I can

4044.7 --> 4052.2
just use that setting because people are

4048.75 --> 4054.87
more subjected to retardation they also

4052.2 --> 4058.56
are much more easy to accept things and

4054.87 --> 4065.7599999999998
just go along to get along with whatever

4058.56 --> 4068.4
even with crazies or with unusual ideas

4065.76 --> 4073.65
that may seem crazy to those that are

4068.4 --> 4077.7200000000003
not very trained at it so yeah you know

4073.65 --> 4080.4300000000003
every really Indian every single

4077.72 --> 4084.81
disadvantage every single one of them

4080.43 --> 4088.2799999999997
has an advantage and now I'm actually

4084.81 --> 4090.93
quoting a a football legend

4088.28 --> 4096.900000000001
here in the Netherlands that was famous

4090.93 --> 4097.29
for saying that yo home drive oak what

4096.9 --> 4101.639999999999
is it

4097.29 --> 4103.739
el cuñado have safor do or he said it

4101.64 --> 4106.2300000000005
the other way around every disadvantage

4103.739 --> 4108.839
no as every advantage has its did

4106.23 --> 4111.719999999999
disadvantage I don't know which one it

4108.839 --> 4114.48
was but he was very it was a positive

4111.72 --> 4116.759
message like yes things will always go

4114.48 --> 4121.099999999999
shitty but you can always take advantage

4116.759 --> 4121.1
of of it somehow in a good way

4139.21 --> 4144.7
hmm anyway yeah you guys seem to be back
