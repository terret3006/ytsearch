38.17 --> 46.489000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.14 --> 48.620000000000005
early-bird number 241 I'm your host

46.489 --> 50.33
Arwen and before we start show please

48.62 --> 51.169999999999995
don't forget to share it on any platform

50.33 --> 54.68
you deem fit

51.17 --> 59.809
except Facebook me because they went

54.68 --> 61.129
overboard big time and also if you

59.809 --> 62.989
haven't already subscribed to my channel

61.129 --> 64.75999999999999
and hit about notification so you know

62.989 --> 67.21
when I'm going live which is normally

64.76 --> 69.71000000000001
2:00 p.m. answer damn time every day

67.21 --> 73.03999999999999
please also support my show through the

69.71 --> 75.55
Super chats PayPal patreon and my

73.04 --> 80.09
GoFundMe that would be much appreciated

75.55 --> 82.28
so good morning everyone sorry for being

80.09 --> 85.97
a little bit late explain later the

82.28 --> 88.64
weather today is dry at least still bit

85.97 --> 91.61
clouded it's kind of moist and warm it's

88.64 --> 96.979
not the most pleasant types of weather

91.61 --> 98.81
my opinion but it's okay it actually did

96.979 --> 101.77
pretty much keep on raining all

98.81 --> 108.229
throughout the evening yesterday and

101.77 --> 112.55
I've found like a slightly dry spot for

108.229 --> 114.619
me to do my paper rounds and it just so

112.55 --> 118.149
happened to be exactly when Randy was

114.619 --> 121.039
live-streaming his right to hand the

118.149 --> 127.61
presentation but I did see it afterward

121.039 --> 131.75
and I was surprisingly yeah impressed by

127.61 --> 133.88
it not so much by his attitude but by

131.75 --> 136.55
the things that he brought forth and I

133.88 --> 138.62
also left a comment over at Randy's on

136.55 --> 140.3
that video so if you haven't seen that

138.62 --> 143.18
check it out it was really interesting

140.3 --> 146.59900000000002
because he was basically doing the same

143.18 --> 150.68
thing from the same angle as I've been

146.599 --> 153.14
very carefully trying to construct from

150.68 --> 154.81900000000002
the bottom up basically a criticism on

153.14 --> 158.35999999999999
quantum mechanics that it's based on

154.819 --> 161.54
presuppositions and right hand put it

158.36 --> 163.90900000000002
down pretty well but he also mixed up a

161.54 --> 164.73999999999998
couple of things and the cue yeah straw

163.909 --> 167.53
man a key

164.74 --> 170.05
since that didn't were incorrect and it

167.53 --> 172.21
was very messy and he raged a lot

170.05 --> 173.92000000000002
sounded really like a raging SOI boy

172.21 --> 176.71
sorry right the hand you do

173.92 --> 179.07999999999998
you should just step away from

176.71 --> 180.64000000000001
everything anger related just don't

179.08 --> 184.63000000000002
express that because it makes you look

180.64 --> 189.07
absolutely horrific not saying that John

184.63 --> 193.72
over here is all that great but at least

189.07 --> 196.23999999999998
he has some control over his own the way

193.72 --> 199.12
he expresses things and that yeah you

196.24 --> 204.73000000000002
should work on that but other than that

199.12 --> 207.31
a lot of good points that allow almost

204.73 --> 210.31
perfectly reflect some of the approaches

207.31 --> 212.23
that I've been saying and then he seemed

210.31 --> 215.59
to be experimenting a bit

212.23 --> 218.56
BRR yeah conceptualizing a little bit

215.59 --> 221.17000000000002
beyond that don't necessarily agree with

218.56 --> 224.31
all everything he said absolutely but it

221.17 --> 224.30999999999997
was interesting

224.97 --> 234.28
so yeah that happened also yeah I need

232.45 --> 240.73
to redress the whole situation with

234.28 --> 244.69
moral because yeah I was pretty he's a

240.73 --> 247.14999999999998
persistent stood my ground because

244.69 --> 248.98
Morrell was just being pushy and

247.15 --> 252.6
annoying and it's funny because there's

248.98 --> 255.76
another type of video that was on

252.6 --> 258.21999999999997
through oh and Benjamin that kind of

255.76 --> 260.14
reminds me of that type of behavior you

258.22 --> 263.89000000000004
might have seen it on our and Benjamin

260.14 --> 267.66999999999996
it's like last video he posted a guy

263.89 --> 270.06
that's just being like oh bring it on

267.67 --> 274.03000000000003
bring it on fight me and he's obviously

270.06 --> 276.01
no match for anyone and that's kind of

274.03 --> 278.34999999999997
the situation that it felt like with me

276.01 --> 282.25
Amuro so that's also why I don't want to

278.35 --> 285.31
attack him but I made a technical

282.25 --> 288.15
mistake and I asked others to point out

285.31 --> 293.14
hey if you know a better way to do this

288.15 --> 294.90999999999997
tell me and nobody really did everybody

293.14 --> 296.53
just seemed perplexed by the whole thing

294.91 --> 297.52000000000004
on the debates when I brought that forth

296.53 --> 298.98999999999995
and

297.52 --> 302.53
even asked afterwards you might have

298.99 --> 304.02
heard it in the after show but I figured

302.53 --> 308.44
out that I made a mistake

304.02 --> 310.78
considering my analysis of Merle because

308.44 --> 314.229
I looked up of psychotic and what

310.78 --> 319.44899999999996
psychosis technically is and I was

314.229 --> 323.53
incorrect my yeah Merle is not psychotic

319.449 --> 328.62
so I apologize Merle for calling you

323.53 --> 332.02
that you're not psychotic but you are

328.62 --> 334.0
like on the edge of it and every symptom

332.02 --> 338.919
that I basically described about you

334.0 --> 341.349
still stands I just put the wrong label

338.919 --> 343.78
on it the label I put there is what

341.349 --> 345.849
happens if it gets much worse and I

343.78 --> 347.85999999999996
don't know if Merle will get worse I

345.849 --> 352.99
don't think so I think he's been like

347.86 --> 356.83000000000004
this like pretty stable you could say so

352.99 --> 360.49
yeah my apologies Merle is not psychotic

356.83 --> 364.99
but he is well I can oh yeah I guess if

360.49 --> 369.069
I have to just he's a bit wonky that's

364.99 --> 372.789
it so just to clarify that and I prevent

369.069 --> 375.779
lawsuits which are challenging and yeah

372.789 --> 379.479
so let I want I needed to correct that

375.779 --> 385.33
because in the end facing him it also

379.479 --> 388.99
became more about just actually kind of

385.33 --> 393.25
true I was kind of troll baiting him and

388.99 --> 396.039
that was I should have just looked that

393.25 --> 404.319
[ __ ] up in detail before and then just

396.039 --> 408.099
be perfectly correct so so now that I

404.319 --> 410.65000000000003
address that because yeah psychosis is

408.099 --> 412.63
described as a severe mental disorder in

410.65 --> 415.44899999999996
which thoughts and emotions are so

412.63 --> 418.74
impaired that contact is lost with

415.449 --> 418.74
external reality and

421.18 --> 431.0
that's almost what I described but it's

427.34 --> 434.27
one step further because he's not

431.0 --> 437.15
entirely lost considering emotions for

434.27 --> 440.81
example he's not entirely lost it's just

437.15 --> 445.96999999999997
that when he suffers through certain

440.81 --> 450.38
emotions then he loses control and he

445.97 --> 454.07000000000005
loses his sight on limitations that you

450.38 --> 461.54
need like his emotion severely impair

454.07 --> 464.15
him you could say but not in a yeah in a

461.54 --> 468.17
social way it's so difficult to describe

464.15 --> 470.12
it he doesn't like shut down like some

468.17 --> 472.91
people do under stress now with him he

470.12 --> 476.02
actually becomes like manic in a way

472.91 --> 480.35
like come at me bro and starts to act

476.02 --> 484.57
like he's a bit a tough guy and that's

480.35 --> 484.57000000000005
just so weird

488.46 --> 496.03999999999996
anyway let's yeah let's move on to the

492.42 --> 499.56
next subject let's see who is in chat

496.04 --> 502.38
lots of activity yeah I actually tried

499.56 --> 506.25
to start an hour early but there was

502.38 --> 510.69
literally no one and it just I kind of

506.25 --> 513.39
need people being there in order to get

510.69 --> 516.27
going so I just played a game in the

513.39 --> 520.04
meantime it was good amusement I kind of

516.27 --> 522.93
drank all my Tamera coffee at that time

520.04 --> 527.37
so that's why I don't have it anymore

522.93 --> 534.93
but I still do have tea because I got up

527.37 --> 540.84
pretty early today so anyway let's get

534.93 --> 544.13
through chat AGM was here he was first a

540.84 --> 546.95
neighbor over mocha came in Amanda young

544.13 --> 554.18
also drunken ball at four one one

546.95 --> 554.1800000000001
Voynich face ute

557.49 --> 574.58
bit off venom flatout faith a flat man

565.88 --> 574.58
dating in fret and a tequila hope bill G

579.55 --> 583.9599999999999
yeah good to see you guys

588.59 --> 596.48
ha you're gonna bring it back on on the

592.279 --> 598.88
the rest of the weirdo trolls yeah did

596.48 --> 601.94
by the way what did you guys have any

598.88 --> 603.67
reflection after in retrospect on what I

601.94 --> 607.3100000000001
said yesterday

603.67 --> 611.7199999999999
pretty much my opening statement about a

607.31 --> 619.3299999999999
hello parish Mike right away and odds

611.72 --> 621.65
and sods but it seems like a chaotic

619.33 --> 629.14
counter movement and there's a lot of

621.65 --> 631.91
people jumping on and it seems in a way

629.14 --> 639.8
like there are all people that either

631.91 --> 643.1
just can't can't adapt to like the broad

639.8 --> 647.2099999999999
scope of science and some of the issues

643.1 --> 648.82
there and are rebelling and others that

647.21 --> 651.85
are kind of I don't know they're just

648.82 --> 656.57
they're Restless they want to keep on

651.85 --> 658.22
digging and they are now getting kind of

656.57 --> 660.2600000000001
I don't know they're losing track I

658.22 --> 663.4100000000001
don't know what it is but I think that

660.26 --> 665.81
right the hand at least is is digging in

663.41 --> 669.5
fruitful ground and I called for um on

665.81 --> 671.5999999999999
to people to basically get onto this and

669.5 --> 674.12
I'm glad that it's happening and I'm

671.6 --> 676.46
gonna hopefully be part of that maybe

674.12 --> 678.5600000000001
one time I could have right to hand here

676.46 --> 683.45
on my show and have a good conversation

678.56 --> 686.03
and maybe help him out get over that

683.45 --> 688.88
rage against John because it's extremely

686.03 --> 694.43
counterproductive I know because I I had

688.88 --> 696.95
that I bottled it up but there's more

694.43 --> 699.4399999999999
effective ways of dealing with him like

696.95 --> 703.1
he does kind of take criticism but he

699.44 --> 706.0100000000001
always has to save face and so that's

703.1 --> 707.2090000000001
why in the more recent period of dealing

706.01 --> 709.76
with him every time there is something

707.209 --> 713.42
bugging me or seems to be ruining the

709.76 --> 715.04
atmosphere and don't and I don't think

713.42 --> 716.54
it's funny because sometimes it just

715.04 --> 719.24
seems to be kind of funny I don't know

716.54 --> 721.79
what that is but a lot of the times it's

719.24 --> 725.78
just not funny to me

721.79 --> 728.7199999999999
and then I'll just put it down there and

725.78 --> 731.3
just not be a John John you're stupid

728.72 --> 733.34
John always ruining it unless I do that

731.3 --> 737.06
as a joke because it is kind of funny to

733.34 --> 741.2800000000001
do it as a joke and at the same time you

737.06 --> 744.4399999999999
don't get such a troll fight after that

741.28 --> 747.86
but I don't know I think that John has

744.44 --> 750.7600000000001
kind of improved his overall attitude in

747.86 --> 753.65
his live performances and yeah

750.76 --> 757.64
credit has to be given where credit is

753.65 --> 763.49
due so at the same time yeah there's

757.64 --> 766.22
still the the opening front that I've

763.49 --> 770.09
also engaged in and I hello by the way

766.22 --> 772.4300000000001
Adam ikan good to see you and but I am

770.09 --> 776.72
open for guests by the way but I'm gonna

772.43 --> 779.18
continue this but I think that quantum

776.72 --> 783.19
eraser is gonna be probably the first

779.18 --> 788.5999999999999
one maybe some more who knows maybe even

783.19 --> 791.36
some the more intelligent on the fence

788.6 --> 792.8000000000001
people or ballers may actually join in

791.36 --> 793.97
because they're really into quantum

792.8 --> 795.5899999999999
mechanics and they might be able to

793.97 --> 797.48
defend it so this might become like a

795.59 --> 799.3100000000001
new front line situation I don't know

797.48 --> 802.13
how many people will come to the defense

799.31 --> 804.88
of quantum mechanics or if this is

802.13 --> 808.1899999999999
something that will just really sink in

804.88 --> 811.21
an expose that there is another

808.19 --> 811.21
machination there

813.33 --> 820.83
we'll figure it out as we go we'll see

816.12 --> 824.839
who arises a and and opposes us in our

820.83 --> 824.839
concept in our Rican sexual ization

827.48 --> 831.0
mm-hmm anyway let's see I got something

829.8 --> 833.64
oh right

831.0 --> 836.04
ooh I hope that somebody would say hello

833.64 --> 839.8389999999999
on skype but it was Nathan putting out

836.04 --> 839.8389999999999
his hangout link early

847.7 --> 855.22
quantum is a Thomas Tom ISM another

852.23 --> 858.41
religion yeah I like that a Tom ISM

855.22 --> 861.19
that's that's a good way to put it a Tom

858.41 --> 866.63
ISM atomism

861.19 --> 869.8100000000001
and it really starts the point at

866.63 --> 874.16
several things nothing it quantum

869.81 --> 877.9899999999999
mechanics radioactivity fission

874.16 --> 882.3199999999999
supposedly these seem to be kind of

877.99 --> 884.48
store cover stories for effects in that

882.32 --> 889.3100000000001
region and nothing seems to be

884.48 --> 892.13
completely what it would truly is so

889.31 --> 894.14
this is really interesting and it was

892.13 --> 896.18
kind of inevitable that quantum

894.14 --> 898.58
mechanics would be drawn into doubt as

896.18 --> 902.78
soon as people started to have doubts

898.58 --> 907.64
about nuclear related issues because

902.78 --> 910.28
yeah radioactivity that kind of things

907.64 --> 912.56
and quantum mechanics puzzled

910.28 --> 916.97
light-being particles it's kind of in

912.56 --> 922.25
the same range it's all atomism and how

916.97 --> 927.1600000000001
that has been explained to us monotheism

922.25 --> 932.52
what youth

927.16 --> 932.52
I really

933.49 --> 940.9590000000001
you want to separate the elements of of

936.66 --> 944.61
creation in the energies and then

940.959 --> 948.8789999999999
worship that try to communicate with

944.61 --> 955.24
separated elements of creation that

948.879 --> 959.1700000000001
seems unbalanced I guess you could

955.24 --> 964.3
address a Pantheon as several faces of

959.17 --> 967.059
the same creation but you will risk

964.3 --> 971.319
automatically to start ignoring elements

967.059 --> 976.99
I know it because I used to be kind of a

971.319 --> 979.179
pantheist I'd still do have some

976.99 --> 980.49
recognition I'm still trying to figure

979.179 --> 983.499
out what that is

980.49 --> 988.3290000000001
pantheism and monotheism and the

983.499 --> 991.24
reflections thereupon were part of well

988.329 --> 993.189
my new part but still overall pretty big

991.24 --> 995.639
because it was a huge experience but

993.189 --> 1002.5999999999999
they were part of my visions is also

995.639 --> 1002.6
just there is something about all of it

1002.72 --> 1010.6990000000001
anyway yeah I think I might be getting

1007.049 --> 1017.579
bit vague here about this but anyway I

1010.699 --> 1019.9799999999999
these days I prefer to just follow the

1017.579 --> 1024.3799999999999
path of Christ and not be so concerned

1019.98 --> 1028.939
about any personified deities you know

1024.38 --> 1034.529
even if they were supposedly so powerful

1028.939 --> 1036.74
then they really don't need anything of

1034.529 --> 1036.74
us

1037.42 --> 1040.47
not really

1043.91 --> 1050.3500000000001
I think we should be more concerned with

1045.98 --> 1050.35
just being good caretakers

1061.179 --> 1065.69
right bit of venom and that's so

1063.59 --> 1070.52
interesting but yeah that would like the

1065.69 --> 1073.789
Elohim what are the Elohim are because

1070.52 --> 1076.03
I've it's such a difference with the

1073.789 --> 1079.25
rest of the conceptualizations of God

1076.03 --> 1085.51
where it's more uniform Alpha Omega and

1079.25 --> 1090.11
yellow heme seem to be like designated

1085.51 --> 1095.09
manifestation to be tools for creation

1090.11 --> 1097.8799999999999
and maybe that is even what officially

1095.09 --> 1099.6499999999999
the Fallen Angels and all that where

1097.88 --> 1103.2800000000002
that came out of it's basically a tool

1099.65 --> 1106.8200000000002
that was that went rogue maybe that is

1103.28 --> 1110.27
what it's all about it's just part of

1106.82 --> 1113.3899999999999
the original magnificent creation and

1110.27 --> 1120.1689999999999
all its might an unbelievable glory and

1113.39 --> 1122.8400000000001
then there was a break with the with the

1120.169 --> 1125.0200000000002
blueprint and I guess creation let it

1122.84 --> 1125.02
happen

1136.45 --> 1141.1000000000001
right at a meeting yeah I think you

1139.389 --> 1143.7589999999998
totally get what I was trying try to

1141.1 --> 1143.759
convey

1153.22 --> 1160.0
yeah but but but just just consider this

1157.48 --> 1165.1200000000001
from this perspective and trying to

1160.0 --> 1169.75
address Adam mostly just consider that

1165.12 --> 1173.77
there are like these sub channels that

1169.75 --> 1175.08
basically on the edge of this is kind of

1173.77 --> 1178.53
fake on the edge of where matter

1175.08 --> 1181.1499999999999
transits into absolute the god realm

1178.53 --> 1183.94
yeah I call it the source that's where I

1181.15 --> 1184.9
think the personified deities may be or

1183.94 --> 1187.3200000000002
whatever yeah

1184.9 --> 1189.1000000000001
so the personification is like

1187.32 --> 1196.03
oversimplification to column like that

1189.1 --> 1202.8999999999999
but these arms of the creator like just

1196.03 --> 1206.23
think about what ego would do if that's

1202.9 --> 1212.13
what they had with the experience that

1206.23 --> 1216.3700000000001
we have with ego and and humanity like

1212.13 --> 1219.4
that doesn't seem very good the idea and

1216.37 --> 1223.78
I think that any kind of religion that

1219.4 --> 1230.89
basically tries to attribute ego driven

1223.78 --> 1232.3
elements deities is is basically it it

1230.89 --> 1236.8300000000002
couldn't be

1232.3 --> 1238.87
correct because to me it's like how I

1236.83 --> 1241.6599999999999
would conceptualize it from the Creator

1238.87 --> 1244.9599999999998
standpoint if an element like a part of

1241.66 --> 1247.53
the tool you used to it's like one of

1244.96 --> 1249.79
your agents basically one of the

1247.53 --> 1252.76
bureaucrats in but this is rough

1249.79 --> 1256.03
conceptual and government style God the

1252.76 --> 1259.3
Creator his direct tools one of them if

1256.03 --> 1261.52
they'd got an ego and just started to do

1259.3 --> 1264.25
things their own way completely then

1261.52 --> 1269.77
either that has been secretly part of

1264.25 --> 1272.8
the design it must be right or it would

1269.77 --> 1277.3899999999999
basically corrupt and then be cut off

1272.8 --> 1280.21
from its energy and replaced because in

1277.39 --> 1284.2900000000002
the spiritual realm and create a concern

1280.21 --> 1286.77
that shouldn't be any real obstacle so

1284.29 --> 1289.78
it's like

1286.77 --> 1292.51
considering that the personified deities

1289.78 --> 1296.29
are the pantheon from whatever cultural

1292.51 --> 1298.18
angle you approach it if they would be

1296.29 --> 1300.79
corrupted or some of them in some way

1298.18 --> 1304.66
with ego then apparently that's part of

1300.79 --> 1307.42
the design plan and maybe that is the

1304.66 --> 1314.02
very concept of the devil that there is

1307.42 --> 1316.51
supposed to be some kind of their house

1314.02 --> 1320.74
I think about maybe there has to be

1316.51 --> 1324.1
mistakes in every religion in order for

1320.74 --> 1326.53
it to be able to function as to be

1324.1 --> 1328.81
mistakes that people can fall into there

1326.53 --> 1330.7
has to be traps mind traps in every

1328.81 --> 1334.4199999999998
religion it seems to be in every

1330.7 --> 1341.65
religion maybe if they'd if they're not

1334.42 --> 1343.3600000000001
there then it somehow doesn't work but

1341.65 --> 1346.69
then again you have religion you know

1343.36 --> 1350.31
it's still like a group binding system

1346.69 --> 1354.3700000000001
so that's why much more for personal

1350.31 --> 1356.5
individual religions that could

1354.37 --> 1359.35
basically cooperate with others

1356.5 --> 1364.15
like-minded and then go on using

1359.35 --> 1367.9499999999998
frequency as a as a measuring tool for

1364.15 --> 1373.6200000000001
the decision-making instead of a

1367.95 --> 1373.6200000000001
top-down code for the group

1375.769 --> 1381.299
yeah all right Mandela effect yeah I

1379.799 --> 1383.369
should bring that up for a second it was

1381.299 --> 1386.339
kind of I thought it was kind of funny

1383.369 --> 1388.259
although also worrisome sometimes but

1386.339 --> 1391.529
I'm not gonna get too carried away about

1388.259 --> 1399.33
it but apparently something happened to

1391.529 --> 1401.519
Superman the old guy that and and here's

1399.33 --> 1403.1999999999998
the funny thing I need to extrapolate a

1401.519 --> 1406.559
bit on this because it was interesting

1403.2 --> 1410.779
Mandela effect so the guy a lot of

1406.559 --> 1415.849
people remember as Christopher Reeves

1410.779 --> 1419.249
ree ves the old Superman from the iconic

1415.849 --> 1421.139
what is it 70s movies somewhere over

1419.249 --> 1424.529
there in that same time period that

1421.139 --> 1426.589
really brought forth iconic hero effect

1424.529 --> 1429.479
more than anything else I think and

1426.589 --> 1431.58
weird silly things like spinning around

1429.479 --> 1435.419
earth supposedly turning back time it

1431.58 --> 1436.859
was hilariously silly but yeah now

1435.419 --> 1438.1190000000001
apparently his name seems to have

1436.859 --> 1440.9689999999998
dropped the ass

1438.119 --> 1443.58
but here is the weirdest thing it's

1440.969 --> 1447.229
almost like it's incomplete because

1443.58 --> 1450.389
there is huge amounts of materials

1447.229 --> 1452.489
music-wise for example out there that

1450.389 --> 1455.6999999999998
are inspired by this man that remain

1452.489 --> 1461.7
name-drop Christopher Reeves and that

1455.7 --> 1464.249
has not been altered so before it seemed

1461.7 --> 1467.1290000000001
like Mandela effect seems to influence

1464.249 --> 1470.219
things pretty extremely and it's just

1467.129 --> 1472.649
uniformly change and people really also

1470.219 --> 1476.3690000000001
do remember it now it seems to be almost

1472.649 --> 1480.4189999999999
like incomplete it's divided up now

1476.369 --> 1483.359
there's chaos because some things have

1480.419 --> 1486.1190000000001
changed it and some have not that's a

1483.359 --> 1490.099
new type of Mandela manifestation if you

1486.119 --> 1495.359
ask me it's much weirder but then again

1490.099 --> 1498.809
yeah the name Christopher Reeves it's

1495.359 --> 1502.46
also much easier mistaken because if you

1498.809 --> 1505.02
attribute something to him like

1502.46 --> 1507.55
Christopher Reeves

1505.02 --> 1511.69
Superman because there are other

1507.55 --> 1513.55
Superman movies then yeah you say

1511.69 --> 1516.64
Christopher Reeves even though you would

1513.55 --> 1519.55
mean Christopher Reeve so that's and

1516.64 --> 1521.8000000000002
yeah especially he was iconic so that's

1519.55 --> 1528.01
very easily done and a lot of people

1521.8 --> 1530.59
then may at that time just jumbled it up

1528.01 --> 1534.67
a little bit more and that might have

1530.59 --> 1538.09
like migrated on so it's not entirely

1534.67 --> 1540.49
sure with this one according to me it

1538.09 --> 1542.8
might simply be a very stupid annoying

1540.49 --> 1544.93
mistake that slipped in pretty early on

1542.8 --> 1547.6
they tried or they well they tried to

1544.93 --> 1552.48
correct it but it didn't go through or

1547.6 --> 1552.48
maybe they kind of like screwed it up

1552.69 --> 1561.49
because they didn't like the guy I don't

1558.82 --> 1563.56
know maybe they're just nagging him

1561.49 --> 1565.68
because they don't like the old Superman

1563.56 --> 1571.33
icon so they're trying to sow confusion

1565.68 --> 1574.03
surrounding the character I don't know

1571.33 --> 1579.28
but I thought it was pretty telling that

1574.03 --> 1582.1
it the changes have not been uniform so

1579.28 --> 1584.83
that tells me that there are certain

1582.1 --> 1591.9699999999998
conditions in order for the change to

1584.83 --> 1594.73
manifest somehow and that also kind of

1591.97 --> 1596.74
bypasses the idea of literally this

1594.73 --> 1599.89
entire world being a matrix and the

1596.74 --> 1603.16
modele effect being a change in the

1599.89 --> 1604.72
matrix kind of effect I'm getting much

1603.16 --> 1609.0700000000002
more feeling that there may be some

1604.72 --> 1611.88
other weird type of surreal type of

1609.07 --> 1615.76
magic extra dimensional maybe in nature

1611.88 --> 1620.3100000000002
that is doing it rather than a reset of

1615.76 --> 1625.15
the matrix maybe some really weird trick

1620.31 --> 1628.3899999999999
or maybe even like a overkill applied

1625.15 --> 1630.4
magician's trick somehow I still don't

1628.39 --> 1633.01
understand a lot of how that happens and

1630.4 --> 1637.99
it's always suggested like oh yeah it's

1633.01 --> 1638.62
everything is always pure trick but I

1637.99 --> 1640.809
don't know may

1638.62 --> 1643.09
it's because I'm kind of a dreamer and I

1640.809 --> 1644.8899999999999
do believe in incredible things being

1643.09 --> 1647.62
possible as I've experienced pretty

1644.89 --> 1649.75
incredible things but maybe there are

1647.62 --> 1652.51
some weird tricks out there that are

1649.75 --> 1654.97
real and they might even be inclined to

1652.51 --> 1656.74
just fake it out more in public to

1654.97 --> 1659.47
really make people believe that it is

1656.74 --> 1662.2
all fake so they can then perform

1659.47 --> 1664.9
they're real serious magic tricks and

1662.2 --> 1667.9
literally nobody would understand and

1664.9 --> 1670.0900000000001
they would be convinced that it was

1667.9 --> 1683.95
faked somehow even though nobody can

1670.09 --> 1687.58
figure out how so then again the nature

1683.95 --> 1689.8600000000001
of people to devise up trigger trickery

1687.58 --> 1692.799
to fool people using all kinds of

1689.86 --> 1696.6689999999999
mechanisms and light effects is pretty

1692.799 --> 1698.44
astonishing how far that goes but yeah

1696.669 --> 1700.3600000000001
that's why I immediately brought it it

1698.44 --> 1703.63
may be some kind of dreamer thing of me

1700.36 --> 1705.789
that I just refused to submit that oh

1703.63 --> 1709.0
it's everything it's like oh it's always

1705.789 --> 1711.76
gonna be fake it could always turn out

1709.0 --> 1714.279
to be fake and there's a big chance that

1711.76 --> 1716.26
most of it is but there still may be

1714.279 --> 1718.27
some weird things going on and I think

1716.26 --> 1722.47
that this mandala effect kind of falls

1718.27 --> 1727.69
into the same category but it seems to

1722.47 --> 1730.1490000000001
be bound to specific figures one could

1727.69 --> 1734.169
are let's just say this is just I'm

1730.149 --> 1739.6589999999999
putting it out there let's just say that

1734.169 --> 1741.429
maybe people that kind of like did deal

1739.659 --> 1744.97
with the whole kind of issue with

1741.429 --> 1749.8300000000002
Hollywood are the ones that are viable

1744.97 --> 1754.27
for this kind of weird effect and only

1749.83 --> 1756.8799999999999
then and that people that don't engage

1754.27 --> 1760.059
in that are not subjected to the change

1756.88 --> 1762.22
maybe that is it though this like that

1760.059 --> 1764.529
is kind of like sowing suspicion

1762.22 --> 1767.169
immediately with anything involved with

1764.529 --> 1770.799
the Mandela effect so I don't run want

1767.169 --> 1771.6100000000001
to like draw conclusions from that idea

1770.799 --> 1773.44
that

1771.61 --> 1775.9599999999998
everything mandala related has to be

1773.44 --> 1779.6390000000001
kind of Satanist in origin or it can't

1775.96 --> 1783.059
happen but who knows further

1779.639 --> 1783.059
investigation is required

1788.85 --> 1796.4089999999999
oh that's fascinating Phillip Evans

1793.1 --> 1798.99
Phillip Evans says chat the Bible

1796.409 --> 1802.74
describes at least two ferments one for

1798.99 --> 1805.139
the stars and one where the birds fly

1802.74 --> 1807.35
none of them are described as solid

1805.139 --> 1810.5089999999998
that's fascinating

1807.35 --> 1813.48
that's my I thought so I thought so

1810.509 --> 1816.419
because I listened to people talking

1813.48 --> 1819.99
about Bible stuff for example Paula from

1816.419 --> 1821.3400000000001
Bible Bible literalist I yeah before I

1819.99 --> 1824.159
could know I still listen to it

1821.34 --> 1826.399
sometimes but I learned a lot and the

1824.159 --> 1829.769
firmament questions always came up

1826.399 --> 1831.9599999999998
multiple times and I heard some of it

1829.769 --> 1835.08
and yeah it didn't say a physical though

1831.96 --> 1837.72
I think I remembered it like that so

1835.08 --> 1846.049
it's good to hear that I how I remember

1837.72 --> 1852.8990000000001
it is actually correctly it's just that

1846.049 --> 1856.2
there is a firmament but people we who

1852.899 --> 1858.809
we are now and how we've learned things

1856.2 --> 1861.419
and the language changed perhaps and the

1858.809 --> 1863.4289999999999
entire angle to all of it there may be

1861.419 --> 1865.8890000000001
some missing factors that we used to be

1863.429 --> 1868.23
taken for absolute granted that nobody

1865.889 --> 1871.2299999999998
could ever forget that we have been made

1868.23 --> 1873.23
to forget perhaps by deep suppression

1871.23 --> 1878.99
and that might eventually come floating

1873.23 --> 1878.99
but maybe that's what I am experiencing

1879.769 --> 1886.6200000000001
but we simply can't understand what they

1883.32 --> 1891.9289999999999
mean with the firmament all we know is

1886.62 --> 1896.34
that there is water related to it that's

1891.929 --> 1898.41
it we don't know what it is

1896.34 --> 1902.6899999999998
do we even know with absolute certainty

1898.41 --> 1907.23
that it is described within the physical

1902.69 --> 1911.31
realm completely I've wondered sometimes

1907.23 --> 1913.8
that maybe creation like the Adam Eve

1911.31 --> 1915.81
creation was not in the physical realm

1913.8 --> 1919.26
yet and then when they walked out of

1915.81 --> 1922.62
paradise they literally solid

1919.26 --> 1924.99
yeah they translated into the entropy

1922.62 --> 1926.9399999999998
based physical realm as by the way

1924.99 --> 1928.31
quantum eraser describes it which I

1926.94 --> 1930.48
really appreciated

1928.31 --> 1934.85
because I kind of agree with that

1930.48 --> 1936.54
concept it plays into that that that

1934.85 --> 1940.82
conceptualization that part of the

1936.54 --> 1944.34
vision that about it they were in the

1940.82 --> 1946.5
upper dimension where there was a

1944.34 --> 1948.1699999999998
everything the blueprint was there the

1946.5 --> 1953.88
design was there everything was there

1948.17 --> 1957.48
but it was a turtle and then they were

1953.88 --> 1960.93
cast down like the entire realm perhaps

1957.48 --> 1964.47
was cast down or they were displaced to

1960.93 --> 1967.68
another part of the realm where entropy

1964.47 --> 1970.38
would gather like out of paradise so in

1967.68 --> 1975.0900000000001
in it's definitely another realm

1970.38 --> 1977.67
it's another setting who knows maybe

1975.09 --> 1979.4099999999999
that original paradise does exist

1977.67 --> 1981.8700000000001
somewhere or maybe it's been destroyed

1979.41 --> 1984.45
maybe it's unreachable maybe it's

1981.87 --> 1986.82
changed maybe God has redesigned the

1984.45 --> 1988.56
garden do we ever get to hear about it

1986.82 --> 1991.3799999999999
maybe it is eternal and it's just

1988.56 --> 1992.6399999999999
exactly there forever as Adam left it

1991.38 --> 1997.74
who knows

1992.64 --> 2000.8000000000002
does anybody know that about that but I

1997.74 --> 2004.34
conceptualized that all creation exists

2000.8 --> 2005.81
at first in a timeless realm or where

2004.34 --> 2009.98
time had no consequence

2005.81 --> 2013.61
and then they translate it into a into

2009.98 --> 2017.47
our familiar earth realm where we will

2013.61 --> 2021.8899999999999
would be suggested to entropy and to

2017.47 --> 2024.58
need for sustenance for real and not

2021.89 --> 2024.5800000000002
just for joy

2032.52 --> 2041.3
okay is anybody following me matrix is

2037.98 --> 2041.3
in the Bible now what

2059.61 --> 2066.42
okay for an itch what it what are you

2062.01 --> 2068.3700000000003
saying oh this is how discussion out

2066.42 --> 2072.0
here apparently that you're having

2068.37 --> 2073.95
separately from me Sun and Moon Oh God

2072.0 --> 2076.08
there we go that yeah that's that's the

2073.95 --> 2078.3799999999997
astrological interpretation it's very

2076.08 --> 2082.86
interesting how that works doesn't it

2078.38 --> 2089.25
because that yeah heavenly bodies seem

2082.86 --> 2091.59
to be perhaps an original blueprint or

2089.25 --> 2095.79
maybe an internal reflection there

2091.59 --> 2097.9500000000003
there's a great mystery to the heavenly

2095.79 --> 2101.87
interpretation and the structure of

2097.95 --> 2101.87
pretty much all the stories out there

2104.06 --> 2108.71
what what are you talking about footage

2122.84 --> 2130.9100000000003
they're cool

2126.81 --> 2130.91
that's interesting Phillip Evans

2137.57 --> 2144.1000000000004
really a demeans hypocrite holy [ __ ] are

2145.33 --> 2176.18
you sure it's not willing to tell me

2168.74 --> 2178.4799999999996
directly or at least the interpretation

2176.18 --> 2178.48
of the name

2184.21 --> 2188.76
now wait maybe this is it

2196.28 --> 2199.0
huh

2204.07 --> 2212.1400000000003
okay I'm getting some page here I have

2206.92 --> 2215.23
no idea who this is but they are saying

2212.14 --> 2216.22
that it kind of relates to the word red

2215.23 --> 2222.31
or ground

2216.22 --> 2224.56
it's like Terra so all these relations

2222.31 --> 2230.62
for it according to this person seems to

2224.56 --> 2232.7999999999997
be telling that atom is earth rather the

2230.62 --> 2232.7999999999997
name

2238.9 --> 2242.55
that's fascinating isn't it

2258.38 --> 2270.08
Strong's what is it Strong's hit what is

2261.84 --> 2270.08
that strong okay

2280.39 --> 2283.259
all right

2285.68 --> 2290.95
the blue letter Bible I don't know what

2288.02 --> 2290.95
this is by the way

2302.42 --> 2306.91
I don't know about this

2317.3 --> 2326.86
what is what is Strong's by the way that

2321.31 --> 2326.86
aged 120 what is that

2343.17 --> 2350.9700000000003
what are you trying to type ute there

2345.75 --> 2353.51
are some words that I censor just a

2350.97 --> 2353.5099999999998
couple hour

2359.789 --> 2361.849
you

2364.55 --> 2374.3300000000004
right Adam agrees with me that's what I

2367.31 --> 2377.17
saw as well now according to these very

2374.33 --> 2378.79
specific types of what apparently

2377.17 --> 2383.57
Strong's

2378.79 --> 2385.7599999999998
a-h 120 then it could be seen as some

2383.57 --> 2393.3500000000004
other way apparently including hypocrite

2385.76 --> 2397.2400000000002
I seems very weak very weakly to me just

2393.35 --> 2397.24
this one little word here

2411.97 --> 2418.24
the Strongs is the one all the Christian

2415.71 --> 2424.2400000000002
apologists use what what's a Christian

2418.24 --> 2427.7799999999997
apologist you mean small hat cooked

2424.24 --> 2430.2
Christians like sellout churches is that

2427.78 --> 2430.2000000000003
what it is

2446.6 --> 2455.5
oh you mean specifically Flat Earth

2449.57 --> 2457.94
related apologists I don't know look

2455.5 --> 2461.66
there's just people that just don't want

2457.94 --> 2463.82
to do it you know look the globe I think

2461.66 --> 2466.58
I really think that it has become much

2463.82 --> 2470.63
more about psychology than anything else

2466.58 --> 2474.47
the psychology of it just makes people

2470.63 --> 2479.21
want to evade going for a flat earth

2474.47 --> 2482.0299999999997
it's such a task and but I think it's

2479.21 --> 2486.2
also pretty temporary because I think

2482.03 --> 2489.01
the next generations will probably not

2486.2 --> 2492.5
show the same symptoms

2489.01 --> 2494.69
they'll have different issues and like I

2492.5 --> 2498.23
think that the next generation will be

2494.69 --> 2499.28
very polarizing ly different because of

2498.23 --> 2501.14
all this because of all the

2499.28 --> 2505.88
indoctrination some people will be nut

2501.14 --> 2508.8799999999997
cases and maniacs like people turn into

2505.88 --> 2512.7200000000003
artificial Psychopaths and others will

2508.88 --> 2514.94
be like very totally getting it right

2512.72 --> 2517.7
away and knowing like know even from

2514.94 --> 2519.62
young on no you can't ever fall into

2517.7 --> 2522.23
that trap or when they did like

2519.62 --> 2524.63
immediately figure out like oh that's

2522.23 --> 2527.39
not gonna lead to something good I'm not

2524.63 --> 2529.58
gonna be that fool and I think it will

2527.39 --> 2533.17
be very polarized and it all depends on

2529.58 --> 2533.17
yeah what what are they gonna do

2536.97 --> 2541.9199999999996
and I think that's more gonna be about

2539.28 --> 2545.4
ya the psychology issues and that Flat

2541.92 --> 2547.98
Earth will not be so impactful as our

2545.4 --> 2550.71
generations that were much more strictly

2547.98 --> 2553.35
indoctrinated with it and that's I think

2550.71 --> 2555.6
a lot of the original systems that even

2553.35 --> 2560.19
allow that type of indoctrination to

2555.6 --> 2562.5899999999997
that level are basically all starting to

2560.19 --> 2564.6
fight itself it's all starting to

2562.59 --> 2566.67
disintegrate it's it is part of the

2564.6 --> 2568.5299999999997
basically the same thing that also

2566.67 --> 2571.31
provides the deep state structure but

2568.53 --> 2574.2000000000003
it's like the deep state structure

2571.31 --> 2577.2799999999997
invaded the or took over the original

2574.2 --> 2580.9199999999996
system that was kind of applying

2577.28 --> 2583.3500000000004
propaganda in a way that at least seemed

2580.92 --> 2585.2400000000002
kind of good but was still abuse but

2583.35 --> 2590.0699999999997
it's not a lot of confusion about it and

2585.24 --> 2594.33
the confusion rose to the top and then

2590.07 --> 2597.48
yeah they basically did it coming up so

2594.33 --> 2600.0299999999997
now there's open evil on top of that

2597.48 --> 2602.61
original indoctrination system that's

2600.03 --> 2607.32
been structurally implemented originally

2602.61 --> 2609.03
in secret and I think that in the future

2607.32 --> 2611.19
that's not going to be a big problem

2609.03 --> 2614.19
anymore because the condition is already

2611.19 --> 2616.53
they over killed it and that will simply

2614.19 --> 2620.55
result in I in the polarization of

2616.53 --> 2622.8
maniacs and people that are just not

2620.55 --> 2625.5600000000004
susceptible that are immune to that [ __ ]

2622.8 --> 2627.6000000000004
that's what it's gonna result in in Flat

2625.56 --> 2630.24
Earth Glover that's not gonna be an

2627.6 --> 2632.04
issue because people that are gonna have

2630.24 --> 2634.8799999999997
that as an issue that are gonna have an

2632.04 --> 2638.33
issue with for example Flat Earth or

2634.88 --> 2642.2400000000002
extremely with the globe in a crazy way

2638.33 --> 2644.25
they're all gonna be part of people that

2642.24 --> 2646.2599999999998
just have no control and that act like

2644.25 --> 2647.46
demons more and more and more more one

2646.26 --> 2650.7900000000004
way or the other and that may go

2647.46 --> 2656.9
completely insane or get monstrous or

2650.79 --> 2656.9
just say like ah I don't know anymore

2658.46 --> 2665.569
and that's what in my opinion is gonna

2661.22 --> 2669.0789999999997
naturally roll out of this I don't think

2665.569 --> 2671.3
that that polarized issue with Flat

2669.079 --> 2673.9700000000003
Earth is going to be here for the next

2671.3 --> 2677.75
generations because they're already been

2673.97 --> 2681.0499999999997
subjected to they'd already been forced

2677.75 --> 2682.97
to basically confront themselves with

2681.05 --> 2685.6090000000004
everything and take responsible for

2682.97 --> 2688.069
their own mind and some of them fail but

2685.609 --> 2693.5299999999997
because it's for some of them succeed

2688.069 --> 2695.0589999999997
and so it's not gonna be yeah people

2693.53 --> 2696.98
that are gonna have issues with it are

2695.059 --> 2699.079
gonna have issues it's probably a lot

2696.98 --> 2702.67
more things than just that and they're

2699.079 --> 2702.67
just gonna be whining about everything

2705.13 --> 2712.01
so on the long run even the Flat Earth

2708.619 --> 2715.069
versus globe is it's important that it's

2712.01 --> 2717.619
happening and especially for the older

2715.069 --> 2719.359
generations it's still something to busy

2717.619 --> 2721.9700000000003
themselves with but I think that in

2719.359 --> 2723.319
future generations it's not gonna be

2721.97 --> 2723.77
like this anyway I don't think we're

2723.319 --> 2725.299
good

2723.77 --> 2727.78
the goers are gonna get older and

2725.299 --> 2732.23
eventually there will be no more globus

2727.78 --> 2734.3590000000004
like that except for people that want to

2732.23 --> 2736.22
be like part of the controllers are

2734.359 --> 2739.0099999999998
going to be like oh I'm gonna try out

2736.22 --> 2741.5299999999997
being a spin doctor be part of the click

2739.01 --> 2747.1090000000004
and then go to NASA or something that

2741.53 --> 2750.3390000000004
may happen but those will be yeah those

2747.109 --> 2752.93
won't be innocent people eventually

2750.339 --> 2757.18
because it's not

2752.93 --> 2757.18
yeah the cover is blown for all of it

2763.319 --> 2772.21
what Q is preaching and teaching Flat

2766.99 --> 2775.29
Earth apologetics what what in the what

2772.21 --> 2775.29
do you mean with that

2788.17 --> 2796.29
if you're actually if you mean apology

2791.29 --> 2796.29
ISM apologetics okay

2806.88 --> 2817.61
oh right apologetics for Flat Earth

2811.29 --> 2817.61
really no way no that's not true

2817.88 --> 2827.6400000000003
he is apologetic religiously about his

2822.81 --> 2831.7999999999997
own convictions he's not he's absolutely

2827.64 --> 2835.5299999999997
not perfect and yeah we're work well

2831.8 --> 2838.05
he's probably working on it he seems to

2835.53 --> 2839.52
be working on himself at least in some

2838.05 --> 2842.52
way so that's promising

2839.52 --> 2844.86
but everybody's working on and so I

2842.52 --> 2847.41
don't think that he's apologetics

2844.86 --> 2851.1
concerning Flat Earth at all doesn't

2847.41 --> 2853.92
need to he actually helped us with great

2851.1 --> 2861.5699999999997
arguments technical arguments getting us

2853.92 --> 2864.17
giving us teaching us new discipline the

2861.57 --> 2868.98
new disciplines of speech of where

2864.17 --> 2872.46
science is coming from where that is

2868.98 --> 2874.5
being seated so we learned a lot from

2872.46 --> 2876.21
quantum eraser and you can't really take

2874.5 --> 2879.48
that away no matter how annoying you

2876.21 --> 2881.25
think he is sometimes or how much no

2879.48 --> 2886.71
matter how much you disagree on certain

2881.25 --> 2890.21
concepts like I do but I don't see him

2886.71 --> 2893.4900000000002
as an apology and an apologetics

2890.21 --> 2897.71
apologist I guess it's called for Flat

2893.49 --> 2897.7099999999996
Earth at all I don't get that

2906.029 --> 2913.489
no that's wrong our colored genius is

2909.119 --> 2917.1290000000004
not measured with IQ that's ridiculous

2913.489 --> 2918.979
intelligence quickness is measured with

2917.129 --> 2922.529
IQ genius

2918.979 --> 2925.319
requires a creative element and that's

2922.529 --> 2931.159
unique you can't measure it you can

2925.319 --> 2933.869
recognize it when it manifests you can

2931.159 --> 2937.199
gauge how strong it is with the

2933.869 --> 2939.599
intervals of when it appears and then

2937.199 --> 2943.589
you can deem somebody a genius or not

2939.599 --> 2945.589
depending on how much of that type of

2943.589 --> 2953.419
thing

2945.589 --> 2953.419
impresses you so know

2962.08 --> 2971.38
look and people can be just absurdly

2965.11 --> 2973.9300000000003
smart IQ wise big just quick but that

2971.38 --> 2979.6
doesn't mean that they're flawless can

2973.93 --> 2984.1299999999997
also be accompanied with just a lack of

2979.6 --> 2986.56
creative thinking you just mechanize you

2984.13 --> 2988.6600000000003
can use system very quickly you can

2986.56 --> 2992.35
master those people I guess I would

2988.66 --> 2994.66
imagine would be great manual readers

2992.35 --> 2996.43
that just master a system very quickly

2994.66 --> 2998.2599999999998
because they'd be good manual readers

2996.43 --> 3002.91
but when it comes to actually designing

2998.26 --> 3006.84
things they may be very kooky and not

3002.91 --> 3008.73
very effective but yeah and then there

3006.84 --> 3011.19
may be people that are extremely

3008.73 --> 3015.57
intelligent and creative and then they

3011.19 --> 3019.71
are probably more likely to have social

3015.57 --> 3022.7400000000002
issues because because of the social

3019.71 --> 3024.39
issues they kind of deflected all their

3022.74 --> 3026.22
intention and energies on that and then

3024.39 --> 3029.0099999999998
started developing in the other regions

3026.22 --> 3033.2099999999996
which were more which yielded more

3029.01 --> 3036.92
viable occupation and then those social

3033.21 --> 3041.31
issues will remain lingering so

3036.92 --> 3048.2000000000003
intelligence and genius know the real

3041.31 --> 3057.18
genius is the ability to apply all of it

3048.2 --> 3060.21
and just push the boundary for example

3057.18 --> 3066.5099999999998
on some concept or change a way of

3060.21 --> 3069.3
thinking and open up something new which

3066.51 --> 3072.53
will influence everybody's thinking

3069.3 --> 3075.1200000000003
that's real genius the genius lies in

3072.53 --> 3078.92
opening up people's mind by touching

3075.12 --> 3082.0699999999997
upon new ground that nobody saw and

3078.92 --> 3084.21
doing it at the right time preferably

3082.07 --> 3085.77
because if you don't do it at the right

3084.21 --> 3087.33
time everybody's just gonna be saying

3085.77 --> 3089.67
like what the hell are you talking about

3087.33 --> 3091.5299999999997
that doesn't it I don't get what you're

3089.67 --> 3093.33
saying this is so far out there to me I

3091.53 --> 3095.46
just don't get it there's some of the

3093.33 --> 3097.0789999999997
responses that I used to get

3095.46 --> 3101.27
in the beginning of when I was doing

3097.079 --> 3104.76
YouTube videos a lot of that but

3101.27 --> 3106.349
afterwards now people are getting it

3104.76 --> 3108.63
much more and there's others that are

3106.349 --> 3111.48
now kind of following that same

3108.63 --> 3116.13
construction of thought because it is

3111.48 --> 3118.289
viable in many ways there is something

3116.13 --> 3121.67
to it that's why I'm interested in that

3118.289 --> 3121.67
in that angle

3127.03 --> 3132.55
yeah the line between brilliance and

3130.03 --> 3133.92
madness I crossed the line that's

3132.55 --> 3140.7400000000002
hilarious

3133.92 --> 3146.65
well the thing is brilliance to many

3140.74 --> 3150.37
people is madness when it is not the

3146.65 --> 3153.4
right time to sink in with everyone but

3150.37 --> 3155.68
that also tipping yeah that typically

3153.4 --> 3158.62
makes it look like madness until later

3155.68 --> 3164.25
and then everybody starts to figure it

3158.62 --> 3168.22
out and then it suddenly flips around so

3164.25 --> 3171.16
you could almost per default recognize

3168.22 --> 3173.3799999999997
false genius if somebody's gonna be put

3171.16 --> 3175.24
forward on some stage and he's gonna be

3173.38 --> 3179.52
the media ever it's just gonna call him

3175.24 --> 3183.4599999999996
a genius genius genius then that almost

3179.52 --> 3186.97
automatically excludes them from being

3183.46 --> 3189.93
an actual genius like Einstein for

3186.97 --> 3193.2099999999996
example who was pushed for it like that

3189.93 --> 3195.43
because actual geniuses the one that

3193.21 --> 3198.7
really afterward turn out to be geniuses

3195.43 --> 3206.44
almost always are scoffed at by everyone

3198.7 --> 3209.73
like Tesla so that's how you know it's

3206.44 --> 3213.94
so funny because it's actually

3209.73 --> 3219.82
applicable as a systemic thing you can

3213.94 --> 3222.58
make a directive out of it and that is

3219.82 --> 3227.65
if you're trying to figure out new

3222.58 --> 3232.9
things see what it does to people and if

3227.65 --> 3235.27
it's a radical fruitful new idea then

3232.9 --> 3237.1
two things will happen some people will

3235.27 --> 3240.15
be blown in their mind some people may

3237.1 --> 3243.61
become very gentle and jealous and [ __ ]

3240.15 --> 3245.56
or just be become quite listeners

3243.61 --> 3248.32
because they want to let it sink in

3245.56 --> 3252.61
because it feels good and others will

3248.32 --> 3256.6600000000003
just attack and immediately try to flag

3252.61 --> 3259.819
you as insane or trying to turn everyone

3256.66 --> 3262.89
crazy remember that

3259.819 --> 3267.0589999999997
so that's how you recognize real genius

3262.89 --> 3270.68
or even good ideas that could be genius

3267.059 --> 3273.3900000000003
by the natural response

3270.68 --> 3277.819
it's fascinating way to approach

3273.39 --> 3280.799
information to find the truthfulness by

3277.819 --> 3285.45
throwing it out there and see how it is

3280.799 --> 3288.66
reflected upon in a way that is how we

3285.45 --> 3290.729
are discovering a lot and we don't even

3288.66 --> 3294.989
consciously realize that it does work

3290.729 --> 3297.089
like that most of the time it's so funny

3294.989 --> 3298.92
like originally before I started to

3297.089 --> 3301.729
engage in the Flat Earth debates and

3298.92 --> 3305.9990000000003
really become part of all this I thought

3301.729 --> 3312.049
that almost everything in the media was

3305.999 --> 3312.049
scripted in some way originally and

3312.41 --> 3318.839
eventually I figured out no way that's

3314.459 --> 3321.479
it's not many people can use like key

3318.839 --> 3325.949
words to basically remind them of

3321.479 --> 3330.209
subjects and I can even use that but a

3325.949 --> 3334.339
lot of the times things really naturally

3330.209 --> 3337.5589999999997
arrive and manifest them in an entire

3334.339 --> 3340.019
concept and they arise that happens with

3337.559 --> 3346.079
me it also happens with some other

3340.019 --> 3349.6989999999996
people that well let's just say I think

3346.079 --> 3352.259
that Alex Jones has these moments but

3349.699 --> 3354.989
yeah that doesn't mean that everything

3352.259 --> 3356.64
he does is over all lot just like genius

3354.989 --> 3360.119
or something I just think that he has

3356.64 --> 3363.719
his moments he has just definite ups and

3360.119 --> 3367.319
downs and and it's long-term chronic

3363.719 --> 3371.849
issues his approach to things

3367.319 --> 3374.219
but but that's always that ability that

3371.849 --> 3377.4590000000003
he had of just these moments that is

3374.219 --> 3379.829
really the thing that kept me stuck to

3377.459 --> 3383.459
going back because I didn't want to miss

3379.829 --> 3385.349
that that moment enriched so much even

3383.459 --> 3388.979
though much of the rest could have been

3385.349 --> 3390.7490000000003
[ __ ] or just repetitive or old news in a

3388.979 --> 3392.3489999999997
way that's like yeah it is kind of new

3390.749 --> 3393.9889999999996
news to the people that are basic

3392.349 --> 3397.1800000000003
shutting it out of their consciousness

3393.989 --> 3399.13
for a long time but for we had the

3397.18 --> 3401.2
people that have been listening they

3399.13 --> 3402.9100000000003
they know this [ __ ] by heart it's almost

3401.2 --> 3406.4199999999996
getting sickening like yeah yeah we know

3402.91 --> 3408.43
it we know it but still waiting for the

3406.42 --> 3411.099
couple of moments when there's just

3408.43 --> 3414.22
something really awesome manifesting

3411.099 --> 3420.099
because it does happen sometimes some

3414.22 --> 3421.9599999999996
periods more than others yeah that's

3420.099 --> 3425.6800000000003
right peanuts Clark don't over

3421.96 --> 3427.96
generalize it's it's a natural habit to

3425.68 --> 3430.69
do that to start putting things in

3427.96 --> 3431.099
framework to be able to better oversee

3430.69 --> 3435.43
it

3431.099 --> 3437.9500000000003
but if you're gonna then judge detailed

3435.43 --> 3443.259
individuals upon that then you are

3437.95 --> 3445.269
breaking something that you're basically

3443.259 --> 3447.94
taking away their individuality and

3445.269 --> 3449.769
you're not getting the full workings of

3447.94 --> 3452.549
all things you're just getting an aspect

3449.769 --> 3456.16
and then over generalizing it so yes I

3452.549 --> 3458.2
try not to do it I sometimes start out

3456.16 --> 3461.3799999999997
doing it but then as I noticed that I am

3458.2 --> 3464.109
getting giving that angle I immediately

3461.38 --> 3467.309
extrapolate upon it it's like I'm almost

3464.109 --> 3467.3089999999997
afraid not to do it

3470.68 --> 3477.1
because I want to be very specific

3473.2 --> 3479.5299999999997
because my concerns about individuals

3477.1 --> 3482.8199999999997
are rarely because of an over

3479.53 --> 3482.82
generalized thing

3491.07 --> 3498.29
yeah that's that is ironic bit of venom

3494.58 --> 3500.85
that Einstein said that that is very

3498.29 --> 3506.43
that's actually kind of self-conscious

3500.85 --> 3509.7599999999998
in in plain sight it almost makes you

3506.43 --> 3511.83
think that he might had have some level

3509.76 --> 3517.65
of integrity in him hidden somewhere

3511.83 --> 3521.0099999999998
this despite all the rest but maybe he

3517.65 --> 3524.25
just was just being a jackass and like

3521.01 --> 3526.4100000000003
yeah I know I'm [ __ ] but I'm I'm doing

3524.25 --> 3529.2
this and everybody's gonna think I'm a

3526.41 --> 3532.19
genius so I could yeah I'm just gonna be

3529.2 --> 3532.1899999999996
a jackass about it

3546.55 --> 3549.1800000000003
what

3549.38 --> 3554.7490000000003
all right right uh yeah you know what

3553.19 --> 3559.2490000000003
I'm gonna round out the show I kind of

3554.749 --> 3562.009
need a break it was good I think I was

3559.249 --> 3565.7
interesting thanks for yeah having some

3562.009 --> 3571.369
good interaction in chat was a good good

3565.7 --> 3573.89
chat today huh so thanks everyone for

3571.369 --> 3576.9500000000003
coming if you like the show please don't

3573.89 --> 3578.5989999999997
forget to upload it and if you haven't

3576.95 --> 3580.069
already subscribe to my channel and hit

3578.599 --> 3581.599
the bell notification so you know when

3580.069 --> 3584.8089999999997
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

3581.599 --> 3587.119
p.m. amsterdam time every day today was

3584.809 --> 3588.94
a little bit late I wanted to be early

3587.119 --> 3591.9790000000003
turn out to be a little bit late

3588.94 --> 3596.569
sometimes I do start early so I don't

3591.979 --> 3598.519
know if you want to check in early that

3596.569 --> 3601.759
kind of does encourage me because I will

3598.519 --> 3603.049
sometimes just go on earlier if I feel

3601.759 --> 3606.739
like it but it's I'm not gonna do that

3603.049 --> 3609.229
if nobody's there that just unless I

3606.739 --> 3611.359
have like a presentation to do and that

3609.229 --> 3615.3489999999997
doesn't seem to be happening a lot I

3611.359 --> 3617.359
don't seem to be eager doing that I do a

3615.349 --> 3619.6090000000004
lot of my things just improvise in a

3617.359 --> 3622.719
moment like I did on this show that it

3619.609 --> 3626.269
works why would I want to like prefab

3622.719 --> 3629.63
things if I can just get the right flow

3626.269 --> 3634.3999999999996
and make it manifest in the spot you

3629.63 --> 3637.4300000000003
know so anyway I will be back to more

3634.4 --> 3638.569
with flatters early bird number 242 and

3637.43 --> 3640.719
I'm also gonna join the Flat Earth

3638.569 --> 3644.869
debates right after this on the panel

3640.719 --> 3648.4
hashtag me if I indeed yeah again thanks

3644.869 --> 3651.71
everyone for coming until the next video

3648.4 --> 3681.789
keep it flat

3651.71 --> 3681.789
