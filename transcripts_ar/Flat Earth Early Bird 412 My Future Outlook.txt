119.659 --> 125.78
who is in chat today everybody was

121.61 --> 128.39
pretty late also was I I didn't go

125.78 --> 131.54
through had that late but then I woke up

128.39 --> 139.57999999999998
at 1:00 was like whoa apparently I

131.54 --> 144.35
needed that George Sanford was first

139.58 --> 154.33
Obama Cole I'm and a young Tom Parker

144.35 --> 159.4
Nathan Oakley 90-80 flattered space man

154.33 --> 159.4
all right I guess that is it for now

162.94 --> 167.15
yeah I think the trolls also woke up

165.53 --> 170.63
pretty late because I didn't have any

167.15 --> 176.38
down votes up until just a few minutes

170.63 --> 176.38
ago well

186.33 --> 191.729
right so

188.63 --> 191.72899999999998
[Music]

193.849 --> 196.86999999999998
all right here

209.68 --> 213.01000000000002
not some park it's not that crazy it

212.049 --> 215.709
happens to me

213.01 --> 219.519
well since the start of the early bird

215.709 --> 225.04
show and before so there are some people

219.519 --> 227.709
really trying to discourage me but

225.04 --> 237.189
that's not really working though you

227.709 --> 238.81
know I just get used to it but yeah the

237.189 --> 241.269
thing that I am kind of disappointed

238.81 --> 247.51
that although it's not that bad

241.269 --> 250.48000000000002
is that well my channel again or maybe

247.51 --> 253.32899999999998
it's just still the case kind sis seems

250.48 --> 255.069
to be a little stale because I don't get

253.329 --> 259.32
a lot of new subscribers even though I

255.069 --> 264.46
ask literally on every show to share it

259.32 --> 268.08
or maybe you think that just everyone

264.46 --> 270.88
has seen this as or has seen me or

268.08 --> 274.06
because if you're trying to keep me as

270.88 --> 275.83
like your secret little stream that you

274.06 --> 283.57
like but you think nobody else likes

275.83 --> 286.9
then please reconsider I do want a wider

283.57 --> 288.43
audience a little wider just keep it

286.9 --> 292.29999999999995
grown steady I don't want the whole

288.43 --> 297.99
world platform that's yeah that wouldn't

292.3 --> 297.99
make that wouldn't help but

300.66 --> 309.09900000000005
yeah it is not anyway it is what it is

304.05 --> 315.569
ma'am uh hello

309.099 --> 315.569
I like your the hope mozzarellas miss

317.4 --> 327.48999999999995
but yeah anyway it's I had a little

322.93 --> 329.41
personal realization yesterday it's it's

327.49 --> 333.19
about games because yeah I've always

329.41 --> 336.31
been a gamer for a long time but I've

333.19 --> 341.46999999999997
just noticed that well most of the games

336.31 --> 345.58
that have been left to me like they're

341.47 --> 351.84900000000005
all thinking games and planning games

345.58 --> 353.56
and strategy and I got kind of yeah I've

351.849 --> 356.02
been getting sick of it for a long time

353.56 --> 360.909
I haven't really touched upon any new

356.02 --> 364.18
games for a long time because yeah

360.909 --> 366.909
there's no more easy downloading

364.18 --> 370.449
platform for me now available because I

366.909 --> 373.27
used to do that just to check out games

370.449 --> 382.349
and make up my mind if I thought they

373.27 --> 385.03
were good enough to buy and yeah so I

382.349 --> 390.37
just got really frustrated because I

385.03 --> 392.469
just wanted to do something fresh but

390.37 --> 395.65
then I grabbed back at just this web

392.469 --> 398.4
game and old web game and yeah you

395.65 --> 399.75
actually required some reflexes like

398.4 --> 402.729
on-the-spot

399.75 --> 405.159
improvising reflexes it's like basic

402.729 --> 407.949
shooters from the old days that concept

405.159 --> 410.74
the bullet-hell and all that well that's

407.949 --> 413.199
like the overkill version but it was

410.74 --> 414.789
kind of good to do that again and yeah

413.199 --> 418.03000000000003
that's not something I can do every day

414.789 --> 420.219
but do remember again like oh yeah wait

418.03 --> 422.979
it like a lot of the improvising

420.219 --> 424.57
reflexes is what made gaming so good to

422.979 --> 427.96
me and they don't have a lot of those

424.57 --> 430.029
games and in the old days there used to

427.96 --> 430.71999999999997
be a lot more of those types of games a

430.029 --> 432.58
name

430.72 --> 442.3
wouldn't get bored with them very

432.58 --> 447.90999999999997
quickly but yeah even then you know

442.3 --> 452.53000000000003
games are technically just escapism a

447.91 --> 454.18
way to escape not knowing anything else

452.53 --> 458.28
you want to do with your time at the

454.18 --> 460.63
time and yeah if you if you're stuck

458.28 --> 463.98999999999995
waiting for something now well then a

460.63 --> 467.07
game could be yeah an easy way to spend

463.99 --> 471.28000000000003
your time quickly without getting bored

467.07 --> 474.27
but yeah when you play it constantly a

471.28 --> 477.21999999999997
very long time and you escape you try to

474.27 --> 480.88
really escape from time consciousness

477.22 --> 484.78000000000003
then it becomes not so good and to be

480.88 --> 487.54
fair I have had that for a long time I'd

484.78 --> 492.03999999999996
like from very young age on I was very

487.54 --> 495.28000000000003
game addicted but I yeah it was

492.04 --> 497.47
typically just a side effect of me not

495.28 --> 500.28
really knowing how to engage people

497.47 --> 504.99
socially of not having an extensive

500.28 --> 508.05999999999995
easy-going social life and games were I

504.99 --> 509.83
was just more capable at them I was also

508.06 --> 512.62
more capable at them at the time at

509.83 --> 514.06
least than other people well that's what

512.62 --> 520.9
you get when you're very fanatical at

514.06 --> 524.14
them but yeah it's just it doesn't

520.9 --> 528.6999999999999
really work for me anymore and I'm also

524.14 --> 531.34
just getting kind of sick of even

528.7 --> 534.37
figuring out that I got all this time on

531.34 --> 537.1
my hands this book yeah and I still look

534.37 --> 539.29
I spent a lot of time these days just

537.1 --> 543.72
following media getting thoughts from

539.29 --> 546.61
people and then comparing all of that

543.72 --> 550.02
and I'm noticing that yeah there's a

546.61 --> 552.5500000000001
there's there's some strain to this even

550.02 --> 554.71
because I look very deep and there's

552.55 --> 556.3
issues with each individual and they all

554.71 --> 560.01
have their own frequencies and their own

556.3 --> 566.4
angles to things and move

560.01 --> 570.42
and yeah then I compare it to what I do

566.4 --> 580.47
here my show and my income and I think

570.42 --> 586.11
like is this working really you know I'm

580.47 --> 590.28
not I don't have any real connections

586.11 --> 592.98
that of like a group of people that I

590.28 --> 596.76
can I'm building a site with or anything

592.98 --> 600.99
or trying these online platform things

596.76 --> 604.29
out more extensively or even expanding

600.99 --> 606.84
my yeah the trinkets of my channel as it

604.29 --> 610.53
were this is like it's almost like

606.84 --> 614.76
online shop keeping in a way and I never

610.53 --> 616.62
been a champion it because you find you

614.76 --> 619.2
got to be good at just figuring out

616.62 --> 620.94
little busying therapy detail thingies

619.2 --> 626.25
all the time you got to think that's fun

620.94 --> 627.57
and I know I've never been that guy it

626.25 --> 629.85
was even a problem when I was a

627.57 --> 633.21
goldsmith it's just I get too occupied

629.85 --> 635.6700000000001
with the actual craft and I don't like

633.21 --> 637.94
they're required things that come with

635.67 --> 637.9399999999999
that

641.02 --> 651.48
but yeah I I do I wonder like where can

648.73 --> 651.48
I go with this

652.41 --> 665.37
hey Karen be good morning see you well

664.14 --> 669.13
again

665.37 --> 672.01
I'm starting to think again maybe

669.13 --> 675.1899999999999
because I do feel stronger than I did

672.01 --> 677.11
last year most most of it this like

675.19 --> 681.9100000000001
despite all the ups and downs that are

677.11 --> 684.49
still happening because of the fifteenth

681.91 --> 689.14
of the seven chakras and unlocking

684.49 --> 691.63
finally but yeah my habit cycles are

689.14 --> 694.24
still kind of the same and themselves so

691.63 --> 696.85
I'm just trying to make sense where I am

694.24 --> 699.79
and try to find a new angle as to where

696.85 --> 702.4300000000001
to go because it's still kind of like I

699.79 --> 703.959
do kind of feel like I'm stuck like even

702.43 --> 706.2399999999999
the whole situation with the Flat Earth

703.959 --> 708.579
debates and I'm a regular panelist and

706.24 --> 711.25
even like Jose is a little something

708.579 --> 713.68
from time to time yeah and I do things

711.25 --> 716.62
and it's it's interesting it's good I

713.68 --> 719.0999999999999
make some good points I like it but yeah

716.62 --> 723.13
at the same time I'm still in a

719.1 --> 726.87
financially sucky position and even I do

723.13 --> 732.25
get some help from guys and people but

726.87 --> 736.0
it's not really expanding I feel and so

732.25 --> 740.16
I'm thinking maybe I should try some

736.0 --> 744.01
kind of career after all and in a way

740.16 --> 746.68
why I originally even try to avoid that

744.01 --> 750.22
is because I thought I wouldn't be able

746.68 --> 754.81
to properly handle what people would be

750.22 --> 757.48
like but yeah I've had now for five

754.81 --> 761.3499999999999
years roughly or at least three years

757.48 --> 764.3100000000001
pretty intensely I've grown skin so

761.35 --> 764.3100000000001
maybe I can use that

765.8 --> 773.27
like a social skin growing I've used all

770.0 --> 779.03
of this and maybe I can use it maybe I

773.27 --> 784.4
can use that to not explode not get

779.03 --> 788.42
agitated not try to escape socially from

784.4 --> 791.68
a new job that I would attain somehow at

788.42 --> 791.68
least it's a better outlook

800.24 --> 803.309
[Music]

804.809 --> 817.779
not a lot of money and Effie well it's

809.139 --> 821.769
more than it used to be but I'm I guess

817.779 --> 826.36
I'm not sufficient to the Gravatt on

821.769 --> 830.92
myself I don't have the necessary skill

826.36 --> 834.6990000000001
range to do it just on my own and I

830.92 --> 838.92
don't know you know I I feel I do have

834.699 --> 842.019
friends and if I had some idea then I

838.92 --> 846.929
could try to ask somebody like hey can

842.019 --> 846.929
you do that I can do that but on average

847.529 --> 854.29
it's yeah I see people don't have the

851.049 --> 859.689
time really or it's too complicated what

854.29 --> 861.879
I want and it ends up me just basically

859.689 --> 864.879
waiting for people to get enthusiastic

861.879 --> 869.499
do something for me and then taking that

864.879 --> 871.899
moment because besides that I've had a

869.499 --> 875.74
lot of like ideas that I wanted to do

871.899 --> 879.67
and I asked around and just nobody does

875.74 --> 884.339
it nobody has the time I don't know what

879.67 --> 887.709
it is I don't know why a lot of people

884.339 --> 889.3290000000001
up there in flatter scene that have been

887.709 --> 891.9989999999999
in there for a long time why they seem

889.329 --> 897.91
to be partnering up so easily and all

891.999 --> 901.869
that and not with me never really had a

897.91 --> 906.0889999999999
proper answer to that maybe they can

901.869 --> 909.63
even put their finger on it exactly I

906.089 --> 910.7090000000001
don't know maybe maybe I'm just now

909.63 --> 915.579
[Music]

910.709 --> 917.79
going way out there and just getting it

915.579 --> 923.37
around I don't know

917.79 --> 931.53
but yeah I still have a lot of trouble

923.37 --> 934.47
trying to make make sense our size up

931.53 --> 939.24
the situation that I'm in having this

934.47 --> 942.78
show here online and being active on the

939.24 --> 946.4
platforms looking around and just not

942.78 --> 946.4
not getting by

946.7 --> 958.6800000000001
[Music]

969.54 --> 977.24
the business like I'm a teacher great

980.2 --> 986.529
well whatever I would be engaging in it

984.25 --> 991.95
it would be a challenge no matter what

986.529 --> 996.329
for me to mostly not get sick of the job

991.95 --> 996.3290000000001
that's the main challenge

1004.7 --> 1010.51
okay

1007.49 --> 1013.55
[Music]

1010.51 --> 1017.209
yeah but but that seems to be it missed

1013.55 --> 1021.5
mainly it's just being a flat earther

1017.209 --> 1026.089
doesn't get you money and why should it

1021.5 --> 1027.77
really you know but a lot of flat

1026.089 --> 1033.26
earthers have been successful because

1027.77 --> 1035.569
they just have careers and despite them

1033.26 --> 1039.079
being flat earthers they've managed to

1035.569 --> 1045.9189999999999
maintain all that and I find that very

1039.079 --> 1049.28
impressive but yeah I'm not

1045.919 --> 1051.679
I made some poor choices you could say

1049.28 --> 1056.2
or it just didn't have it in me when I

1051.679 --> 1062.6000000000001
was young too distracted to demotivated

1056.2 --> 1066.44
there really and yeah to keep it rollin

1062.6 --> 1069.5
to feel like I really fell and everybody

1066.44 --> 1072.29
was all telling me the opposite but I

1069.5 --> 1076.19
just felt like there's no use to trying

1072.29 --> 1081.98
to keep it rolling I just I couldn't do

1076.19 --> 1088.3700000000001
it I was also too inspired to do other

1081.98 --> 1092.299
stuff too well to get all creative even

1088.37 --> 1096.59
at the time though with with the indie

1092.299 --> 1099.77
and you have my own of yeah occult

1096.59 --> 1102.6789999999999
inspiration research and just digging

1099.77 --> 1105.83
around on the still somewhat fresh

1102.679 --> 1108.2800000000002
internet for conspiracy ideas and all

1105.83 --> 1111.1689999999999
kinds of things so I've just too

1108.28 --> 1114.37
distracted there was too much to engage

1111.169 --> 1114.3700000000001
in and was too glorious

1117.4 --> 1124.43
but yeah I can't really blame that

1120.02 --> 1127.58
because in the end it really was just my

1124.43 --> 1130.46
own unwillingness to engage in that I

1127.58 --> 1136.1899999999998
gave in to that because it was very

1130.46 --> 1139.6100000000001
punishing I did like try jobs during my

1136.19 --> 1144.41
teens and I just really didn't like it I

1139.61 --> 1151.82
didn't have a I was too proud of myself

1144.41 --> 1153.71
and my ideas and everything I had I and

1151.82 --> 1157.22
in a way you always have to have some

1153.71 --> 1160.22
level of humility as a worker with

1157.22 --> 1164.3600000000001
something and I I had a lot of trouble

1160.22 --> 1166.76
with that and I would typically keep to

1164.36 --> 1168.4399999999998
myself but when somebody would then do

1166.76 --> 1172.4
something like that like a boss would

1168.44 --> 1175.28
push me like talk down to me even though

1172.4 --> 1178.0400000000002
I was being very efficient in public and

1175.28 --> 1181.55
that would hurt me so much I would be so

1178.04 --> 1184.21
pissed off I thought I would see the

1181.55 --> 1186.71
technicality of it that was in just and

1184.21 --> 1189.3500000000001
there was like a social thing and I

1186.71 --> 1192.23
didn't accept that I could not accept

1189.35 --> 1195.3799999999999
that so I wouldn't like explode on the

1192.23 --> 1199.19
spot but I would just be so pissed off

1195.38 --> 1201.0500000000002
at it that yeah it wouldn't take too

1199.19 --> 1203.6000000000001
long before I would just quit that job

1201.05 --> 1208.7
and I would speak out about it very

1203.6 --> 1214.3
pissed off then when I quit and yeah it

1208.7 --> 1214.3
got me nowhere this but what do I do

1214.36 --> 1222.4699999999998
well I've grown more skin so maybe it's

1218.36 --> 1226.3899999999999
basically back to that stupid situation

1222.47 --> 1229.6000000000001
again from the bottom up in the dirt the

1226.39 --> 1236.3300000000002
stupid jobs and get over that and

1229.6 --> 1239.9299999999998
somehow then still rise and I may have

1236.33 --> 1243.59
more skills hopefully and just not be so

1239.93 --> 1246.63
bothered by my stupid sense of honour

1243.59 --> 1250.36
that constantly gets in the way

1246.63 --> 1252.72
just try to focus more on on the

1250.36 --> 1255.58
frequency I'm doing things right and on

1252.72 --> 1257.38
finding a better way to respond and I

1255.58 --> 1260.8
have learned a lot of ways to response

1257.38 --> 1263.65
nowadays so I think I could probably do

1260.8 --> 1270.22
it and so maybe I should do it because

1263.65 --> 1275.47
yeah this what I do here you know I do

1270.22 --> 1280.02
appreciate I love it at times but I'm

1275.47 --> 1284.77
stuck I'm financially stuck here and I

1280.02 --> 1286.99
don't have the feeling like it's not

1284.77 --> 1290.71
progressing because even I'm doing

1286.99 --> 1293.17
something wrong on this platform or

1290.71 --> 1300.13
towards my public or anything it's just

1293.17 --> 1306.1200000000001
that apparently people that do sling out

1300.13 --> 1312.7
cash easily yet they like Nathan Oakley

1306.12 --> 1315.31
they like ranty although he also yeah

1312.7 --> 1321.64
doesn't have as much as he used to I

1315.31 --> 1325.87
guess and and Jose still get some but

1321.64 --> 1328.99
yeah what I notice here is that just my

1325.87 --> 1333.52
loyal followers here that who do tend to

1328.99 --> 1336.46
come every day they try to yeah they try

1333.52 --> 1340.0
to drop some change here and I know

1336.46 --> 1342.49
that's like it's very serious and the

1340.0 --> 1346.51
gesture is I understand what that's

1342.49 --> 1350.5
worth but I'm not getting any like some

1346.51 --> 1353.41
of the big players oh well thank for

1350.5 --> 1357.37
example he still he's the last one that

1353.41 --> 1361.98
that really supported me like 20 euros

1357.37 --> 1365.59
it's like helps so much but for example

1361.98 --> 1367.53
only sheep Oh can't see I guess I need

1365.59 --> 1369.9399999999998
to address this for a moment

1367.53 --> 1372.57
like he yeah we've been through

1369.94 --> 1376.049
something together on the show and I

1372.57 --> 1379.87
helped him to a certain insight and

1376.049 --> 1383.83
yeah he maneuvered his life into

1379.87 --> 1385.4499999999998
position where he got into a win-win

1383.83 --> 1388.12
situation for himself where he's

1385.45 --> 1391.1490000000001
crushing it he's got his own company and

1388.12 --> 1394.0
he's got his girlfriend or wife I don't

1391.149 --> 1397.049
I don't know anyway and he's a kid on

1394.0 --> 1400.0
the way I think or he already has one I

1397.049 --> 1402.85
don't remember this is a stupid I don't

1400.0 --> 1404.649
know sorry sorry Risa got the details

1402.85 --> 1410.74
wrong but it was just a great situation

1404.649 --> 1414.9699999999998
and yeah I've had some great talks very

1410.74 --> 1417.159
personal talks with him since yeah in

1414.97 --> 1418.779
the last year but then I started

1417.159 --> 1420.8200000000002
noticing like yeah I don't really see

1418.779 --> 1424.809
him a lot and then when I see him I see

1420.82 --> 1429.58
him in over at Jose's and it is so

1424.809 --> 1439.3799999999999
freaky he's a baller now and I tried to

1429.58 --> 1442.72
carefully address him in in Skype and he

1439.38 --> 1445.919
gave me this or what I can only

1442.72 --> 1449.38
interpret as very confused response

1445.919 --> 1454.75
where he mainly just seems very pissed

1449.38 --> 1458.19
off at at the negativity coming from

1454.75 --> 1461.32
Nathan Oakley and he thinks that I

1458.19 --> 1464.169
embraced that and yeah I technically

1461.32 --> 1467.32
take over some of his approaches because

1464.169 --> 1469.99
of the legitimacy that I see in them but

1467.32 --> 1471.7
yeah a lot of the negatively that Nathan

1469.99 --> 1474.49
puts on top of it and he can't bear that

1471.7 --> 1478.3300000000002
he's very sensitive to these kind he's

1474.49 --> 1483.519
always been extremely positive but his

1478.33 --> 1487.5
response is to then completely step to

1483.519 --> 1491.35
the other side it seems and just doubt

1487.5 --> 1493.029
yeah give credence to to the globe and

1491.35 --> 1498.32
like why couldn't it be like and it's

1493.029 --> 1505.1
just seemed very confused do that yeah

1498.32 --> 1508.71
make me worry about him a lot because as

1505.1 --> 1513.059
he stepped as he basically chose to

1508.71 --> 1516.48
oppose that negativity he sided with the

1513.059 --> 1518.94
other side and I've just seen just what

1516.48 --> 1522.1100000000001
comes from him the energy it's all it's

1518.94 --> 1525.419
more hostile it's almost like he's

1522.11 --> 1533.2489999999998
become slightly Sivan yeah in a way and

1525.419 --> 1535.3200000000002
I I hope not but it is very

1533.249 --> 1538.619
disappointing and at the same time yeah

1535.32 --> 1541.83
he also did absolutely financially

1538.619 --> 1545.82
support me in a big way probably the

1541.83 --> 1548.369
most of anyone and now he doesn't like

1545.82 --> 1552.539
me anymore and he's gotten into this

1548.369 --> 1556.61
situation and when we're before he

1552.539 --> 1561.47
seemed to be extremely thankful and

1556.61 --> 1561.4699999999998
appreciative now suddenly not

1568.73 --> 1578.72
that's quite frustrating because I yeah

1573.74 --> 1581.21
I in my view on things I was kind of

1578.72 --> 1583.13
counting on him to be there kind of by

1581.21 --> 1587.66
my side as someone I could fall back to

1583.13 --> 1592.4
but suddenly it's gone I can't call it a

1587.66 --> 1595.67
betrayal really but it's like an

1592.4 --> 1603.1000000000001
unexpected instability or something I

1595.67 --> 1603.1000000000001
don't know that's not helping

1605.46 --> 1608.589
[Music]

1624.16 --> 1628.22
anyway you have ramen on for almost half

1626.54 --> 1630.53
an hour here and see what you guys are

1628.22 --> 1632.3
talking about doesn't seem like you're

1630.53 --> 1638.3
talking about what I'm talking about

1632.3 --> 1640.58
Oh l used to that because I'm only

1638.3 --> 1645.35
trying to address all of you very

1640.58 --> 1648.73
directly why would you then start

1645.35 --> 1648.73
talking about what I'm talking about

1656.4 --> 1662.48
[Music]

1677.69 --> 1681.68
flatter spaceman yeah

1685.659 --> 1692.2990000000002
well yeah flatter spaceman look it's

1688.49 --> 1694.94
always been a very strange I guess for

1692.299 --> 1698.649
the wider public it's always been my

1694.94 --> 1703.759
personal mission kind of thing to be

1698.649 --> 1706.1899999999998
honest and direct and then on top of

1703.759 --> 1708.6490000000001
that very careful with it because people

1706.19 --> 1712.759
aren't used to it to not stereotype

1708.649 --> 1718.4899999999998
myself to find some anonymity safety

1712.759 --> 1721.73
know to be very strong and present as I

1718.49 --> 1724.22
am because I've experienced every time

1721.73 --> 1726.8890000000001
that I did as I was very young that

1724.22 --> 1729.169
amazing things would come from doing

1726.889 --> 1734.9289999999999
that and my parents encouraged that a

1729.169 --> 1738.769
lot so that's just the way that I've

1734.929 --> 1741.98
become and for people that haven't done

1738.769 --> 1744.98
that most of their lives yeah it's much

1741.98 --> 1747.259
tougher to actually step away from the

1744.98 --> 1749.1490000000001
stereotype from the mask they created

1747.259 --> 1752.3890000000001
because they've gotten so good at that

1749.149 --> 1754.9699999999998
and to then actually show there on

1752.389 --> 1757.49
ourselves while they're on ourselves

1754.97 --> 1761.84
isn't properly developed because it's

1757.49 --> 1767.69
never been exposed so then when do

1761.84 --> 1770.36
people that do wear masks fall into

1767.69 --> 1772.46
stereotypes a lot when they then try to

1770.36 --> 1775.9699999999998
show themselves they they look very

1772.46 --> 1777.769
jittery stumbly and fragile almost like

1775.97 --> 1780.769
a little kid sometimes because they're

1777.769 --> 1786.889
just not used to doing that scary to

1780.769 --> 1789.409
them they didn't grow that part I have

1786.889 --> 1793.399
I've grown I've grown it most of my life

1789.409 --> 1796.279
I and the funny thing is is that I can

1793.399 --> 1798.9189999999999
even sort of wear masks but yeah that's

1796.279 --> 1803.69
literally just called acting and I have

1798.919 --> 1807.5900000000001
to be careful with that [ __ ] because I'm

1803.69 --> 1809.8690000000001
I can make it very real because I have

1807.59 --> 1811.999
all my energies all my personal things

1809.869 --> 1814.9399999999998
available and every time I do you light

1811.999 --> 1817.94
a mat at my mask it's derived from

1814.94 --> 1819.8300000000002
something that I've gone through or that

1817.94 --> 1823.159
like tour that I've experienced it's a

1819.83 --> 1829.49
part of me so even when I do put up an

1823.159 --> 1830.8700000000001
act it is still me I but I don't know

1829.49 --> 1836.6
maybe that's not the right way to

1830.87 --> 1839.6589999999999
explain it but yeah I'm used to just

1836.6 --> 1842.09
literally being myself always I'm not

1839.659 --> 1848.3600000000001
afraid I'm confident that like anyone in

1842.09 --> 1851.9289999999999
the world could see this and yeah

1848.36 --> 1854.6899999999998
nothing I don't feel that something bad

1851.929 --> 1860.419
could come of it except for just people

1854.69 --> 1864.519
with petty frustrations and and the all

1860.419 --> 1871.8200000000002
that seemed to seem to be there a lot

1864.519 --> 1874.309
petty frustrations because everybody's

1871.82 --> 1878.259
wearing masks they don't like it when

1874.309 --> 1878.259
some is just walking around without one

1908.76 --> 1911.21
it's

1912.56 --> 1915.55
they'll clean

1917.48 --> 1920.65
[Music]

1923.12 --> 1927.9199999999998
all right yeah eight and Tom Parker on

1926.93 --> 1932.47
top of that okay

1927.92 --> 1935.96
how many people out there have a literal

1932.47 --> 1942.73
daily standard show at the exact same

1935.96 --> 1942.73
time set and do that every single day

1943.27 --> 1951.7
and and try to manage something and

1948.19 --> 1954.8600000000001
improvise pretty much everything this is

1951.7 --> 1957.8300000000002
you know I I am kind of proud of what

1954.86 --> 1961.4299999999998
I've achieved technically yeah but when

1957.83 --> 1964.55
it comes to the financial backing yeah

1961.43 --> 1967.16
it's not too much better now at the same

1964.55 --> 1970.82
time I've got the other roots the GTI

1967.16 --> 1973.3700000000001
and all that stuff but that seems to be

1970.82 --> 1977.24
going kind of nice but again it's still

1973.37 --> 1980.5
always gonna be long run it's getting

1977.24 --> 1986.53
closer but I'm not there yet I'm still

1980.5 --> 1986.53
at the foot of the mountain

1987.94 --> 1993.22
and it's gonna get a lot steeper a lot

1990.52 --> 1998.11
quicker I could potentially ascend

1993.22 --> 2000.57
financially in the next few years it's

1998.11 --> 2005.6699999999998
not still gonna be in this year but it

2000.57 --> 2007.71
will hopefully I I hope this that at the

2005.67 --> 2009.72
end of the year like it presuming that

2007.71 --> 2012.45
I'm just gonna continue exactly as I do

2009.72 --> 2014.28
right now right and that things would

2012.45 --> 2016.32
pick up because I'm kind of in a

2014.28 --> 2019.35
financial slump right now it's so pretty

2016.32 --> 2026.7
much at the minimum don't really know

2019.35 --> 2031.35
what to do about it but if things pick

2026.7 --> 2034.3500000000001
up slightly and I maintain this what I

2031.35 --> 2037.86
do here then hopefully at the end of the

2034.35 --> 2040.6499999999999
year I will reach that that tipping

2037.86 --> 2045.7199999999998
point financially where finally it's

2040.65 --> 2052.7400000000002
just gonna stay out of the red God can't

2045.72 --> 2054.39
wait for that moment to happen but yeah

2052.74 --> 2059.85
if things are not gonna pick up then

2054.39 --> 2063.45
maybe I will need to cease doing this

2059.85 --> 2067.5299999999997
show and get some kind of job and just

2063.45 --> 2069.7999999999997
see where that goes before as long as I

2067.53 --> 2069.8
need you

2073.679 --> 2076.809
[Music]

2082.32 --> 2088.9500000000003
so yeah in case you people haven't

2085.55 --> 2092.28
gotten it yet I could really use your

2088.95 --> 2096.81
support and that also includes the super

2092.28 --> 2098.28
Jets doesn't help super amounts but

2096.81 --> 2103.29
still it helps a little

2098.28 --> 2106.53
it does balance things out a little but

2103.29 --> 2111.83
yeah if you got anything to spare paper

2106.53 --> 2115.32
or anything that would do a lot of good

2111.83 --> 2119.87
yeah I know peanuts Clark I know they

2115.32 --> 2123.42
suck but it all did it still depends on

2119.87 --> 2126.0899999999997
for me you know though the weird thing

2123.42 --> 2130.38
is when it comes to mechanical things

2126.09 --> 2133.38
concerning jobs I can make almost

2130.38 --> 2136.5
everything interesting like I make

2133.38 --> 2138.87
getting groceries interesting yeah

2136.5 --> 2143.28
because I combine whatever I can I do

2138.87 --> 2146.3399999999997
put a sports elements to it I even kind

2143.28 --> 2150.03
of put a racer race elements to it as in

2146.34 --> 2154.8
that I try to maintain my speed at all

2150.03 --> 2157.8500000000004
times and never get into an awkward

2154.8 --> 2160.8
situation or a potential accident and

2157.85 --> 2163.71
just do that and I make a sport of it

2160.8 --> 2166.9500000000003
all and even though technically what's

2163.71 --> 2168.93
transpiring is is could be considered

2166.95 --> 2170.91
kind of boring I can make it interesting

2168.93 --> 2172.8599999999997
I can do that with jobs that's never

2170.91 --> 2174.48
been the problem the technical side of

2172.86 --> 2178.56
jobs have never been the problem the

2174.48 --> 2183.21
problem will always be either sense of

2178.56 --> 2185.85
hopelessness and boredom from people not

2183.21 --> 2189.65
being very inspired that I work with or

2185.85 --> 2193.29
that there would be just annoying people

2189.65 --> 2195.15
yeah for trying to push me around trying

2193.29 --> 2198.63
to point at me say oh you're not a

2195.15 --> 2201.54
regular person that the social side

2198.63 --> 2205.13
would always be where if things could

2201.54 --> 2208.77
potentially go wrong at a job because

2205.13 --> 2210.2400000000002
yeah no matter how is basic the job is I

2208.77 --> 2212.82
can kind of make it interesting I can

2210.24 --> 2215.3799999999997
cut find something in it that I can

2212.82 --> 2217.7200000000003
optimize our make efficient it can

2215.38 --> 2219.37
always do something with technicals

2217.72 --> 2221.6499999999996
doesn't matter what it is really it

2219.37 --> 2224.23
doesn't no matter what I can always find

2221.65 --> 2226.4500000000003
something - technically occupy myself

2224.23 --> 2228.1
with because I approach the technicals

2226.45 --> 2230.1299999999997
kind of like a computer game it's always

2228.1 --> 2232.75
like okay figure out how this works

2230.13 --> 2238.03
where is the where is room for

2232.75 --> 2241.33
improvement just I can do that no it's

2238.03 --> 2243.13
the social side it is how I feel do I

2241.33 --> 2249.5499999999997
feel that I'm going anywhere

2243.13 --> 2254.73
our people treating me am i bumping into

2249.55 --> 2258.3700000000003
more people that could that do get me

2254.73 --> 2260.71
that could become my friends that could

2258.37 --> 2263.38
maybe help me find a better

2260.71 --> 2269.35
understanding for people that are not

2263.38 --> 2271.21
like me and I do bump into these people

2269.35 --> 2277.08
sometimes like one of my neighbors over

2271.21 --> 2280.27
here is one of those people and like he

2277.08 --> 2282.8199999999997
he doesn't really know me but he has

2280.27 --> 2287.2
this intuition where he just gets me

2282.82 --> 2290.11
like oh he is he's a guy like that it's

2287.2 --> 2292.0899999999997
very different but he feels like yeah

2290.11 --> 2296.2000000000003
but he is a good guy very serious and

2292.09 --> 2298.36
and I feel very climbed to be open with

2296.2 --> 2302.8599999999997
him without much obstruction without

2298.36 --> 2305.29
much fear of triggering him yeah

2302.86 --> 2310.1200000000003
normal people people that just have

2305.29 --> 2313.33
basic lives on occasion watch the news

2310.12 --> 2319.0
watch like typical television shows talk

2313.33 --> 2321.8199999999997
about all that stuff basic people that

2319.0 --> 2326.74
just busy themselves with how their

2321.82 --> 2329.4100000000003
colleagues think of them and that it's

2326.74 --> 2332.4399999999996
not bad people it's just people that

2329.41 --> 2335.47
don't worry about the elite control

2332.44 --> 2339.73
structure and social engineering and the

2335.47 --> 2342.52
political in that not everybody engages

2339.73 --> 2347.83
with that stuff you know

2342.52 --> 2354.4
a lot of people really don't like all

2347.83 --> 2356.47
that so yeah and therefore it's very

2354.4 --> 2359.05
logical that not everybody not

2356.47 --> 2361.3599999999997
everybody's gonna like my show and what

2359.05 --> 2365.26
I do because I typically always do that

2361.36 --> 2366.79
I try not to try to keep the fear

2365.26 --> 2368.7700000000004
pouring out of it because every time you

2366.79 --> 2371.61
do it as always slips in it's always so

2368.77 --> 2376.8
easy to start assuming some kind of doom

2371.61 --> 2380.17
some danger thing out of control and

2376.8 --> 2382.75
that that fear point is also what deters

2380.17 --> 2384.58
a lot of basic people and the fear for

2382.75 --> 2388.36
now it slips in it's always people that

2384.58 --> 2390.94
talk about these things always let the

2388.36 --> 2393.73
fear for and slip in because it is kind

2390.94 --> 2396.31
of like a flame to draw attention but at

2393.73 --> 2397.9900000000002
the same time that flame ruins the clear

2396.31 --> 2406.11
the clarity of the inside it's a very

2397.99 --> 2406.1099999999997
smoky flame so

2421.92 --> 2428.88
huh Wow big Chung is that's funny

2426.02 --> 2433.16
teaching guitar my dad's been a guitar

2428.88 --> 2437.55
teacher like his entire life that I

2433.16 --> 2440.96
don't have the patience for it and my

2437.55 --> 2440.96
fingertips are too sensitive

2450.51 --> 2456.7200000000003
coaching teaching content alright Oh big

2454.53 --> 2460.05
chunga's yeah it is something that I

2456.72 --> 2462.839
thank you for actually honestly thinking

2460.05 --> 2466.1400000000003
with me concerning potentials for the

2462.839 --> 2472.0099999999998
future yeah teaching people things it

2466.14 --> 2475.5
turns out that I guess you could say

2472.01 --> 2480.03
skills aren't naturally spreading as

2475.5 --> 2484.38
much as they used to among young and

2480.03 --> 2487.829
older people so there seems to be a lot

2484.38 --> 2490.109
of people just having blank slates

2487.829 --> 2493.53
trying to figure it out completely from

2490.109 --> 2497.73
scratch by themselves so yeah there's a

2493.53 --> 2501.0600000000004
lot of need for good advice and sources

2497.73 --> 2506.73
that could be considered as reliable

2501.06 --> 2509.52
advice and I hope that people do think

2506.73 --> 2514.56
that I am one of those sources and that

2509.52 --> 2519.21
whatever problems I do have don't poison

2514.56 --> 2522.72
the quality of the advisory information

2519.21 --> 2526.43
that I hand out because it's very

2522.72 --> 2526.43
important to me that it's pure

2529.99 --> 2533.08
[Music]

2534.91 --> 2544.75
hmm yeah unicorns lair I have thought

2539.26 --> 2547.42
about a D&D content channel I don't

2544.75 --> 2554.38
think it's gonna work it's not gonna

2547.42 --> 2558.63
work for me no you know what's actually

2554.38 --> 2563.319
going on I'm having very serious trouble

2558.63 --> 2567.819
with the D&D system itself and hey I I

2563.319 --> 2573.4
helped built a lot of it but I'm running

2567.819 --> 2578.14
into very serious structural problems

2573.4 --> 2580.869
with it as my campaign has gone for a

2578.14 --> 2583.359
long time and it's getting so bad it's

2580.869 --> 2587.559
like the overpowered nests

2583.359 --> 2591.24
is getting so bad that it's literally

2587.559 --> 2594.25
ruining the experience of the game and

2591.24 --> 2598.859
it's a problem that I thought I could

2594.25 --> 2602.23
have helped out of the way but I can't

2598.859 --> 2604.3289999999997
the only way to bypass that problem and

2602.23 --> 2608.049
that is kind of what I originally even

2604.329 --> 2611.5
hope with my D&D is when a lot of the

2608.049 --> 2614.88
game mastering or when the platform

2611.5 --> 2618.609
itself where the game would be utilized

2614.88 --> 2621.4500000000003
would be again yeah a computer game it

2618.609 --> 2624.97
would be the rules the adaptation the

2621.45 --> 2626.9199999999996
application of all the things being done

2624.97 --> 2629.6499999999996
would be done by the computer very

2626.92 --> 2631.63
quickly very it would not have to take

2629.65 --> 2634.329
up time it would not have to take up so

2631.63 --> 2637.6600000000003
much attention and the players could

2634.329 --> 2640.3900000000003
then much easier just focus on what

2637.66 --> 2644.0099999999998
their characters would be making as a

2640.39 --> 2644.0099999999998
decision in the moment

2645.96 --> 2652.03
but yeah

2648.93 --> 2655.72
does anybody know somebody out there

2652.03 --> 2659.86
that would be willing to mechanically

2655.72 --> 2662.5
program an entire D&D structure it would

2659.86 --> 2664.98
be kind of like Neverwinter Nights in a

2662.5 --> 2669.82
way bit of baldur's gate

2664.98 --> 2673.06
other D&D types games but backward you

2669.82 --> 2676.51
have frame framework for the development

2673.06 --> 2679.33
and applications of that and then how

2676.51 --> 2682.2700000000004
the game would actually be you know for

2679.33 --> 2687.8199999999997
me a baldur's gate setup would just be

2682.27 --> 2691.81
fine just a nice painted picture and I

2687.82 --> 2694.26
said anisotropic view doesn't have to be

2691.81 --> 2697.27
all 3d you know that that is completely

2694.26 --> 2701.4100000000003
superfluous to the actual experience of

2697.27 --> 2704.86
the game I've even figured out that as

2701.41 --> 2709.18
games have developed in Indian de games

2704.86 --> 2712.36
that's still the original setup of the

2709.18 --> 2716.56
baldur's gate with anisotropic view no

2712.36 --> 2720.25
3d nonsense and the good music on top of

2716.56 --> 2722.86
that it works the best all the 3d

2720.25 --> 2725.29
thingies and all that in the end after

2722.86 --> 2729.19
playing through all of these types of

2725.29 --> 2731.83
games many many times the original start

2729.19 --> 2736.18
out with very basic surroundings but

2731.83 --> 2741.73
paid attention paintings and designs and

2736.18 --> 2745.12
just hand-drawn locations it worked the

2741.73 --> 2748.96
best that's my conclusion so that's why

2745.12 --> 2752.02
I wouldn't mind starting up a game

2748.96 --> 2754.81
format that would just use that although

2752.02 --> 2759.43
who knows what like I've imagined like

2754.81 --> 2762.43
incredible almost virtual worlds very D

2759.43 --> 2766.4199999999996
in the base that would be kind of like

2762.43 --> 2771.3599999999997
sandbox open platform and then it would

2766.42 --> 2776.44
be a combination of that and struck yes

2771.36 --> 2780.04
was it story change applications

2776.44 --> 2782.14
I have a lot of ideas but I know that

2780.04 --> 2784.18
actually applying these things and fine

2782.14 --> 2785.8199999999997
to again a fine-tuning it and getting

2784.18 --> 2788.02
all the mistakes out of the way and

2785.82 --> 2793.4500000000003
updating it is just such an incredible

2788.02 --> 2795.52
chore so I don't foresee this actually

2793.45 --> 2798.25
manifesting without some serious

2795.52 --> 2804.49
financial backing which I very blatantly

2798.25 --> 2807.04
don't have but who knows what kind of

2804.49 --> 2818.52
interesting game worlds could be born

2807.04 --> 2823.39
from this yeah totally creepy nuts Clark

2818.52 --> 2826.65
yeah when I get financially stable well

2823.39 --> 2832.0299999999997
it's not just financial stability though

2826.65 --> 2838.4700000000003
it's also I need like family dynamics

2832.03 --> 2841.3900000000003
are yeah it's not just the material

2838.47 --> 2843.7599999999998
social setup now there's there's

2841.39 --> 2846.79
energies to deal with and you got to be

2843.76 --> 2851.6200000000003
able to properly build on things that

2846.79 --> 2853.84
will make sense of escapism will

2851.62 --> 2857.41
potentially still be a problem for me I

2853.84 --> 2860.8900000000003
foresee even if I do get a family so I

2857.41 --> 2863.3199999999997
need to be able to have these grounds

2860.89 --> 2868.54
available to me to build on with all

2863.32 --> 2870.7000000000003
that energy and I really kind of hope

2868.54 --> 2877.75
now that I thought about it

2870.7 --> 2882.37
yeah but my girlfriend it would be great

2877.75 --> 2885.39
if they were media savvy are interested

2882.37 --> 2889.99
or in the technicals or like a studio

2885.39 --> 2891.85
person that would be fantastic if I

2889.99 --> 2895.2999999999997
could technically partner up and

2891.85 --> 2899.47
continue what I do but with a girlfriend

2895.3 --> 2901.3900000000003
or a wife eventually I think things

2899.47 --> 2904.91
would

2901.39 --> 2910.73
yeah I think I think that could really

2904.91 --> 2915.49
help me even do all of this better some

2910.73 --> 2915.4900000000002
proper female inside an encouragement

2917.92 --> 2922.96
but yeah

2919.72 --> 2922.9599999999996
who knows

2926.03 --> 2929.199
[Music]

2930.819 --> 2939.009
man but what it definitely comes down to

2935.279 --> 2951.729
for anyone any female I'd be interested

2939.009 --> 2955.319
in sorry is that they would be just very

2951.729 --> 2960.6989999999996
talented they don't even need to have

2955.319 --> 2964.15
incredible and heard of peak talents but

2960.699 --> 2971.4990000000003
if they just had a lot of talent if they

2964.15 --> 2973.719
could kind of match me in energy

2971.499 --> 2977.769
intensity and would be able to deal with

2973.719 --> 2983.589
it and have made themselves into a very

2977.769 --> 2987.2189999999996
serious project on the long term just

2983.589 --> 2990.15
like I have to do things right yeah the

2987.219 --> 2990.15
good work great together

2997.92 --> 3004.31
but yeah I'll get to that when I'll get

3002.13 --> 3004.31
to that

3016.93 --> 3021.6299999999997
hello insanity sanity young dog I'm

3019.99 --> 3026.56
doing fine

3021.63 --> 3033.67
like I've been doing pretty good in last

3026.56 --> 3035.94
month despite being a little sick here

3033.67 --> 3035.94
and there

3050.31 --> 3058.35
right and that's the flutter the baton

3053.67 --> 3060.98
approaches so do the bickering back and

3058.35 --> 3069.9
forth between Flat Earth and the bowl

3060.98 --> 3072.96
startup in my chat of course so typical

3069.9 --> 3074.61
that usually in the last 50 minutes of

3072.96 --> 3076.23
my shows it doesn't really matter what

3074.61 --> 3077.67
I'm talking about it's just going to be

3076.23 --> 3080.6
I'm just going to be reading a lot of

3077.67 --> 3084.59
back and forth between ballers and

3080.6 --> 3084.5899999999997
flat-earthers in my chat

3096.2 --> 3103.8999999999996
no Sandra what's up you're all right

3124.82 --> 3132.32
because I don't set a topic well the I

3130.04 --> 3140.0
did kind of set a topic as basically

3132.32 --> 3146.7200000000003
yeah our wins future on YouTube what

3140.0 --> 3151.43
should I do and yeah I've had some good

3146.72 --> 3153.62
ideas from people so yeah I'm not saying

3151.43 --> 3155.93
that nobody is actually responding so

3153.62 --> 3158.2
thanks everybody for the ideas and the

3155.93 --> 3158.2
thoughts

3171.2 --> 3173.77
maybe

3200.77 --> 3210.53
some of these thought it was good idea

3202.88 --> 3212.33
to still light some fireworks and the

3210.53 --> 3214.6000000000004
birds are not too happy about that of

3212.33 --> 3214.6
course

3275.77 --> 3278.34
it

3283.119 --> 3286.0190000000002
no big changes

3290.98 --> 3297.64
so you're just saying NASA does not use

3294.49 --> 3301.6899999999996
a flat earth model well have you

3297.64 --> 3306.8489999999997
actually looked into the source in chat

3301.69 --> 3312.67
that claimed ya gleam okay can you

3306.849 --> 3314.5
provide a link and you ya not that's not

3312.67 --> 3321.06
the link link can you provide the link

3314.5 --> 3321.06
that actually sources what nASA uses

3345.0 --> 3352.05
no that's not true gleam you got a

3349.62 --> 3361.83
wrench what that's ridiculous

3352.05 --> 3366.6000000000004
you or you posted a link in my chat well

3361.83 --> 3373.0099999999998
please you link up to it or or is it too

3366.6 --> 3373.0099999999998
big right there yeah

3381.96 --> 3387.92
right well there you go that's the link

3384.809 --> 3391.76
why don't you look into that big Yungas

3387.92 --> 3391.76
yeah they do use it

3400.49 --> 3403.5699999999997
[Music]

3404.18 --> 3415.14
well big chunga's that's a question you

3407.19 --> 3418.8
should be asking yourself if they use

3415.14 --> 3421.02
the flat earth model then why are you

3418.8 --> 3423.26
assuming they are putting objects in

3421.02 --> 3423.2599999999998
orbit

3434.69 --> 3440.84
what kind of a dumb trick question is

3436.61 --> 3443.54
that we can't calculate with weight

3440.84 --> 3449.6600000000003
without G well that's because weight is

3443.54 --> 3452.5299999999997
based on G the concept is derived from

3449.66 --> 3457.5499999999997
it yeah of course you can calculus like

3452.53 --> 3460.4900000000002
okay calculate an orbit without the

3457.55 --> 3462.11
earth being a globe yeah no of course

3460.49 --> 3466.39
you can't do that doesn't make any sense

3462.11 --> 3466.3900000000003
because the one is based on the other

3483.949 --> 3491.789
anyway uh I think I'm gonna round out

3488.88 --> 3494.9990000000003
the show for their debates just started

3491.789 --> 3496.829

3523.14 --> 3528.0589999999997

3525.709 --> 3532.6499999999996
so a hash tag me feh

3528.059 --> 3535.219
