121.09 --> 125.77000000000001
weather today is kinda similar to

123.88 --> 130.06
yesterday right now there's a big cloud

125.77 --> 136.41
going over and it's windy but despite

130.06 --> 136.41
all of that it's still warm a bit moist

136.739 --> 144.70000000000002
thank God that noisy thing over there is

140.38 --> 147.48
gone they're still working but yeah not

144.7 --> 149.76
what they did yesterday

147.48 --> 159.03
so I got fresh air all throughout the

149.76 --> 164.819
show so let's see who is in chat so

159.03 --> 168.84
Rufus st. Hubbins morning Steve Obama

164.819 --> 170.51
cool 101 rock hound and mystique cognate

168.84 --> 173.51
a good seal

170.51 --> 180.89
yeah I got with me today to Mara coffee

173.51 --> 180.89
usual and tea that's it

186.68 --> 195.27
yesterday was a blast I watched back the

192.39 --> 198.95999999999998
show and it really was I was so

195.27 --> 206.33
accelerated by red pill philosophy

198.96 --> 209.52
coming on and he is such an energetic

206.33 --> 212.34
attentive guy and very smart

209.52 --> 216.24
I wonder if most people even realize

212.34 --> 218.94
that they might sense it but for me it

216.24 --> 223.86
was like wow to have this guy on the

218.94 --> 226.8
show watch was such a delight because he

223.86 --> 230.01000000000002
really used applies his smarts to build

226.8 --> 235.5
something to help build a show

230.01 --> 237.75
so effectively like I don't know if he'd

235.5 --> 240.39
consider it I'd like partner up with him

237.75 --> 243.42
on a show I don't know maybe I'm being a

240.39 --> 245.25
bit hasty here let's just have him have

243.42 --> 248.73
me have him on of a few more times and

245.25 --> 251.19
see if it'll be just as great but it was

248.73 --> 255.06
awesome I thought and it was good to

251.19 --> 258.89
look at or listen to a really good time

255.06 --> 262.049
putting out more of the complex issues

258.89 --> 264.75
yeah accelerating so after that I went

262.049 --> 267.57
to the debates and those who are good as

264.75 --> 272.3
well and then there were some bumping of

267.57 --> 272.3
heads between flat-earthers

273.14 --> 277.37
yeah there's some ruckus going on

280.45 --> 286.33
I don't know have half most of you watch

283.69 --> 289.29
the debate yesterday plain truth you we

286.33 --> 291.41999999999996
were probably on there by the way hello

289.29 --> 303.67
plain truth

291.42 --> 306.63
Sherlock class Shaw hello Jose you're

303.67 --> 306.63
not new here

318.19 --> 326.07
[Music]

321.71 --> 331.60999999999996
right so before I get all distracted by

326.07 --> 331.61
the jet ah yeah there was debates

331.97 --> 340.29
typical and there was this moment and

338.43 --> 344.13
we're rumpus basically got on the

340.29 --> 348.77000000000004
hangouts panel and he was gonna do a

344.13 --> 354.39
typical weirdo rumpus Wizardry words

348.77 --> 356.52
juggling trick story and yeah we like

354.39 --> 360.18
everybody on the panel knew like oh

356.52 --> 362.43
they're here he goes again but we were

360.18 --> 364.08
kind of wanting to let him finish

362.43 --> 365.669
because otherwise we know what happens

364.08 --> 368.58
if you start interrupting him he'll just

365.669 --> 370.44
uh you're censoring me your since you me

368.58 --> 375.06
your censored you get that kind of [ __ ]

370.44 --> 376.86
so we were like okay let's just we know

375.06 --> 379.73
we have already won pretty much with

376.86 --> 383.7
rhombus so let's just let him talk and

379.73 --> 386.46000000000004
let's just see what happens once he like

383.7 --> 388.11
silences once when he says he's done and

386.46 --> 391.169
we start to respond let's see what

388.11 --> 395.7
happens but then Johnston started to

391.169 --> 398.09999999999997
interrupt him through the discord and he

395.7 --> 400.169
didn't stop he was like no I will not

398.1 --> 404.76000000000005
tolerate this [ __ ] and it's like

400.169 --> 408.32
dude and I spoke up about it and rant he

404.76 --> 411.18
spoke up about it but he just kept them

408.32 --> 413.49
being like that and it was extremely

411.18 --> 420.03000000000003
disruptive he really ruined the moment

413.49 --> 424.59000000000003
there and yeah doesn't it's not good

420.03 --> 426.92999999999995
it's not good for the show it's like a

424.59 --> 431.38
race yeah taking away moments it's not

426.93 --> 433.01
good so yeah I wanted to mention that

431.38 --> 434.96
[Music]

433.01 --> 439.90999999999997
let's see

434.96 --> 439.90999999999997
right oh yeah oh and Benjamin Callum and

440.83 --> 450.71
must be the first time where I actually

443.27 --> 453.94899999999996
just - now he went on about his supposed

450.71 --> 457.35999999999996
to murder duck and then started to make

453.949 --> 462.05
a joke out of it which I think was

457.36 --> 464.15000000000003
tasteless because if he really cared

462.05 --> 466.789
about that duck supposedly and there's

464.15 --> 469.42999999999995
been this big [ __ ] and everything speak

466.789 --> 472.969
duck [ __ ] but she is kind of funny I

469.43 --> 476.90000000000003
guess then why would you then start

472.969 --> 482.539
calling the potential predators to tie

476.9 --> 484.60999999999996
them into racial groups you know I get

482.539 --> 487.15
the joke but we're talking about a real

484.61 --> 490.639
animal supposedly being killed here I

487.15 --> 499.06899999999996
didn't think that was funny at all so

490.639 --> 501.56
again and yeah that was a definite miss

499.069 --> 502.069
for me so I tuned out started do other

501.56 --> 505.759
things

502.069 --> 507.74
wait watch Alec Jones actually get drunk

505.759 --> 510.44
and watch Alex Jones and then I noticed

507.74 --> 516.26
something when you're drunk watching

510.44 --> 518.769
Alex Jones is a lot more fun the sky

516.26 --> 518.769
worrying

522.82 --> 542.95
and interesting but right also thanks to

537.21 --> 546.94
some harsh criticism right-wing media

542.95 --> 548.62
and their overblowing of details of what

546.94 --> 550.45
is happening in the world putting things

548.62 --> 554.11
out of code or not out of context but

550.45 --> 558.82
over blowing them he yeah he was

554.11 --> 562.44
basically saying okay Germany and France

558.82 --> 569.08
are not getting overflown by migrants

562.44 --> 571.0600000000001
not all of them and technically yeah

569.08 --> 573.49
technically that's correct but it is

571.06 --> 575.41
like if you just could go look at the

573.49 --> 578.49
rates it is pretty significant and

575.41 --> 585.39
there's policy tinker tailored to

578.49 --> 585.39
manifest this that's unmistakeably so so

588.13 --> 593.11
the thing about Alex Jones is yes he

590.709 --> 597.4899999999999
over blows it he put something down and

593.11 --> 600.79
then he kind of like fills in the rest

597.49 --> 604.1800000000001
with tell not show and then suggest

600.79 --> 605.98
that's everywhere just to like slap you

604.18 --> 608.949
in the face with it and that's what he

605.98 --> 611.5500000000001
does now is that putting things out of

608.949 --> 611.55
context

612.87 --> 619.259
no is it over blowing something to make

616.3 --> 624.13
to really try to get a point through yes

619.259 --> 626.5790000000001
and I think he's admitted that several

624.13 --> 632.47
times and then proceeds to still do it

626.579 --> 636.16
but it's just it's a cut it's become so

632.47 --> 639.19
complex everything and so politicized

636.16 --> 642.13
and manipulative very default and even

639.19 --> 645.519
like manipulative for supposedly the

642.13 --> 653.199
right reasons but yeah the end result of

645.519 --> 655.72
it is not always fully accounted for so

653.199 --> 658.99
it's like an on the way form of

655.72 --> 665.1990000000001
manipulating and then hoping things will

658.99 --> 670.8100000000001
will turn out all right no oh really

665.199 --> 673.87
Brenda from Assam where although you

670.81 --> 677.319
know what yeah in some cases I guess

673.87 --> 682.99
well it's not even liar look I don't

677.319 --> 685.5999999999999
think Alex Jones let's just say if you

682.99 --> 688.17
can be more specific I'll say if that's

685.6 --> 688.1700000000001
true or not

688.46 --> 695.2900000000001
about Alex Jones is of course a spin

691.07 --> 695.2900000000001
doctor in but not about

700.08 --> 704.33
I don't know where I'm going with this

709.21 --> 716.6500000000001
he doesn't make up fake news

714.13 --> 720.16
like he doesn't create the things where

716.65 --> 721.93
there were none Oh although when he does

720.16 --> 724.3
that he does it like with the camera and

721.93 --> 726.9699999999999
yeah he basically sends out journalist

724.3 --> 730.5699999999999
to do something but that's pretty open

726.97 --> 732.82
and honest really although looking for

730.57 --> 741.37
trouble but yeah that's what journalists

732.82 --> 748.6800000000001
do so he's I don't think he's fake news

741.37 --> 748.68
I just think he just he is manipulative

750.0 --> 759.79
really explain to me how exactly Mark of

757.36 --> 767.26
Melbourne how is Alex Jones a Zionist

759.79 --> 770.56
chill it is he for Israel taking over

767.26 --> 774.04
the Middle East does he like that that

770.56 --> 777.6899999999999
he does he say that because I'm pretty

774.04 --> 781.75
sure that Alex Jones just kind of likes

777.69 --> 785.47
the concept of the nation of Israel and

781.75 --> 788.8
and the people and the industry of it I

785.47 --> 792.19
think he likes that opposing to the

788.8 --> 795.0999999999999
other conditions in the surrounding

792.19 --> 797.9100000000001
regions although they are serious doing

795.1 --> 799.84
pretty good even though they've been

797.91 --> 806.65
yeah pretty much

799.84 --> 808.36
ruffle roughed up by war and I think

806.65 --> 810.04
that it's about that not about the

808.36 --> 813.16
government I've heard Alex Jones

810.04 --> 815.98
definitely have criticism about yeah

813.16 --> 818.3199999999999
people in politics and then again also

815.98 --> 822.9300000000001
sometimes like in a political maneuver

818.32 --> 826.63
attempts trying to yeah

822.93 --> 829.8
protect them I guess or basically defend

826.63 --> 834.9399999999999
them yeah argue for them

829.8 --> 836.9699999999999
so I think Alex Jones is just getting on

834.94 --> 840.3000000000001
the geopolitical angle of it and

836.97 --> 846.8100000000001
realizes yes Israel is kind of

840.3 --> 852.54
become an an ass dick II Ally that's

846.81 --> 858.4499999999999
kind of like trying to mind ya there

852.54 --> 859.709
I could make a certain comparison but I

858.45 --> 863.089
don't know if it would be appropriate

859.709 --> 869.31
but there yeah Israel is trying to like

863.089 --> 871.1700000000001
really take over America through

869.31 --> 874.7399999999999
politics and media you could say like

871.17 --> 877.8
really get become the leader of it as

874.74 --> 880.589
we're almost like the cultural leader in

877.8 --> 884.31
a way like make Israel really important

880.589 --> 886.5600000000001
that's what Israel wants that's why

884.31 --> 889.92
they're all in Congress and try to yeah

886.56 --> 893.88
politically manipulate America to to get

889.92 --> 899.0699999999999
their way every time to guarantee their

893.88 --> 902.07
safety and that's kind of yeah that to

899.07 --> 904.589
the American public themselves to the to

902.07 --> 910.35
the just the American Americans that is

904.589 --> 916.5290000000001
kind of yeah not good that's not an

910.35 --> 919.0500000000001
honest situation so it's it's a mixed

916.529 --> 921.98
bag but the reason the reality remains

919.05 --> 927.0889999999999
is there are certain geopolitical setups

921.98 --> 930.089
certain allied groups like American has

927.089 --> 934.8290000000001
its allies and Russia Russia has its

930.089 --> 938.7900000000001
allies and China and they're intertwined

934.829 --> 943.17
in certain ways but yeah because of that

938.79 --> 945.24
it's kind of set you can't just say oh

943.17 --> 947.9399999999999
you did something wrong I'm gonna drop

945.24 --> 948.839
you because yeah that's gonna create

947.94 --> 952.8000000000001
total chaos

948.839 --> 955.74
so geopolitics freaking complex I'm

952.8 --> 960.5699999999999
serious if you really take into account

955.74 --> 963.74
just a lack of maneuverability everybody

960.57 --> 963.74
has to deal with really

964.36 --> 973.5
it's very tough to make big changes very

967.779 --> 973.5
very tough huge turmoil usually happens

979.38 --> 985.54
now Brenda I didn't say that Israel is

982.42 --> 987.7299999999999
trying to claim sovereignty over the US

985.54 --> 990.55
okay not been talking about literally

987.73 --> 993.9300000000001
taking over I was kind of specific I

990.55 --> 997.06
said they're trying to manipulate

993.93 --> 999.8389999999999
America into being their bodyguard kind

997.06 --> 999.8389999999999
of situation

1005.04 --> 1013.8
it's like a Master Blaster setup very

1009.78 --> 1016.17
appropriate and comparision really but

1013.8 --> 1020.25
that is Israel what Israel wants America

1016.17 --> 1022.62
is really kind of at a bigger helm

1020.25 --> 1026.4
situation at more at the helm of the

1022.62 --> 1031.52
entire geopolitical balance taking all

1026.4 --> 1031.52
kinds of risks and everything and

1033.14 --> 1037.94
they're just seeing it like yeah we just

1036.0 --> 1042.0
need to maintain this in order for

1037.94 --> 1043.65
everything to stay balanced because yeah

1042.0 --> 1047.1
we want to keep it balanced that's the

1043.65 --> 1049.5300000000002
priority right now but that may not last

1047.1 --> 1052.1699999999998
forever you know things can certainly

1049.53 --> 1053.8799999999999
change around like it doesn't even

1052.17 --> 1055.8300000000002
directly have to be related to what

1053.88 --> 1059.1000000000001
Israel does it could be some other

1055.83 --> 1064.1699999999998
countries that suddenly like amp up the

1059.1 --> 1067.7099999999998
aggression and then yeah so the deals

1064.17 --> 1070.68
start to rearrange themselves that kind

1067.71 --> 1074.73
of chaos and you never know what you'll

1070.68 --> 1076.29
end up with look geopolitics and and

1074.73 --> 1078.51
making deals and everything has become

1076.29 --> 1080.55
very quick and very complex

1078.51 --> 1083.48
it's like speech as I already made that

1080.55 --> 1083.48
comparison earlier

1089.82 --> 1097.9299999999998
Wow Brenna for that your band that is

1093.04 --> 1103.71
absolutely disgusting calling me a

1097.93 --> 1107.3400000000001
racist anti-semite that is that is

1103.71 --> 1107.3400000000001
absolutely revolting

1109.05 --> 1112.6
that is absolutely revolting Brenda

1111.64 --> 1118.38
you're bad

1112.6 --> 1123.81
done go back to your freaking Marxist

1118.38 --> 1123.8100000000002
jackoff Circle please

1126.61 --> 1129.7199999999998
[Music]

1137.76 --> 1145.51
i hi hello lone hyena I have no idea

1144.58 --> 1150.37
what you're talking about

1145.51 --> 1153.25
Vatican Israel deeds okay so are you

1150.37 --> 1156.34
saying that Israel is directly owned by

1153.25 --> 1163.72
Rome or by the Vatican is that what

1156.34 --> 1166.6499999999999
you're stating could be look as I said

1163.72 --> 1169.33
it's entangled all over the place and

1166.65 --> 1171.52
it's for me it's kind of tough to

1169.33 --> 1174.6399999999999
pinpoint where the Vatican is really

1171.52 --> 1180.58
into it because the Vatican is like a

1174.64 --> 1183.21
separate manipulation thing besides the

1180.58 --> 1188.32
nation priorities it's like its own

1183.21 --> 1190.6000000000001
geopolitical agency and they involve

1188.32 --> 1196.6789999999999
themselves in so many ways with so many

1190.6 --> 1196.6789999999999
groups so

1201.04 --> 1206.95
sure lone hyena Jerry I've yeah that's

1206.56 --> 1210.31
all right

1206.95 --> 1215.77
look I've looked into it too but it is

1210.31 --> 1218.35
very it's it's difficult and there are

1215.77 --> 1220.8899999999999
so many it's just so much more complex

1218.35 --> 1224.98
than usually people that dive into it

1220.89 --> 1228.01
like to uphold and people get stuck on

1224.98 --> 1235.1200000000001
symbols and what they think is driving

1228.01 --> 1237.67
everything and I personally usually like

1235.12 --> 1242.26
to emphasize situations and dealings

1237.67 --> 1245.2
more with what they do and what they can

1242.26 --> 1248.26
do what they decide on because of the

1245.2 --> 1250.1200000000001
circumstances how that works because if

1248.26 --> 1252.8799999999999
you understand that then you truly

1250.12 --> 1256.6
understand the frequency that drives all

1252.88 --> 1258.3100000000002
of it and I'm very more much more

1256.6 --> 1260.1399999999999
interested in that because if you get

1258.31 --> 1262.12
that frequency right then you can place

1260.14 --> 1265.93
it all into the framework of of

1262.12 --> 1269.4099999999999
everything of all yeah in a more

1265.93 --> 1271.6000000000001
historical framework that would be more

1269.41 --> 1274.99
accurate because it is all attuned to

1271.6 --> 1279.1599999999999
the actual method the methods and the

1274.99 --> 1283.71
mindset and the methodology that these

1279.16 --> 1283.71
groups wield over the course of time

1285.7 --> 1292.75
I agree lone hyena it is a very complex

1290.53 --> 1294.67
subject yeah I'm okay to talk about you

1292.75 --> 1297.01
look you know if you want to have like a

1294.67 --> 1299.74
presentation or a discussion about it

1297.01 --> 1302.04
then add me on skype and I'll have you

1299.74 --> 1302.04
over

1323.96 --> 1332.23
mm-hmm yeah I you know I wonder about

1329.93 --> 1332.23
that

1335.14 --> 1341.99
look supposedly right as I've kind of

1338.96 --> 1344.68
learned it roughly in the Roman days how

1341.99 --> 1348.71
did the Catholic Church came into being

1344.68 --> 1350.63
first the Romans persecuted the

1348.71 --> 1353.96
Christians and everything in the arenas

1350.63 --> 1356.3300000000002
supposedly and then one of the Emperor's

1353.96 --> 1362.39
decided yeah I'm gonna become a

1356.33 --> 1365.84
Christian so at what point from that to

1362.39 --> 1369.3100000000002
the known medieval times where where the

1365.84 --> 1374.11
Vatican was ruling over Europe basically

1369.31 --> 1380.78
where did it turn from a Roman Emperor

1374.11 --> 1385.76
into a Pope or were there absolutely

1380.78 --> 1390.26
separate popes from emperors can

1385.76 --> 1394.51
somebody confirm that or this or deny

1390.26 --> 1394.51
that for me please I don't remember

1396.13 --> 1399.179
[Music]

1400.86 --> 1405.9599999999998
well medieval times look you can call it

1404.279 --> 1410.519
medieval times or not medieval times

1405.96 --> 1416.97
from the the Roman Empire times up until

1410.519 --> 1419.75
the the Roman Church theocracy that's

1416.97 --> 1419.75
what I'm referring to

1428.01 --> 1434.61
right Constantine was the Emperor and

1432.15 --> 1440.97
made himself the first pup well there

1434.61 --> 1445.7099999999998
you go so it's the theocracy is

1440.97 --> 1449.97
literally the Roman Empire actually if

1445.71 --> 1454.6100000000001
you really look at it technically it's

1449.97 --> 1458.46
just no longer dealing in nations it's

1454.61 --> 1463.11
dealing transnationally deals in

1458.46 --> 1468.39
religion and in information so religion

1463.11 --> 1472.04
and secret service basically but it's

1468.39 --> 1472.0400000000002
still the Roman Empire basically

1475.05 --> 1483.6
and I bet you they still get involved in

1479.16 --> 1485.7900000000002
Imperial business there's an empire

1483.6 --> 1490.31
somewhere they're gonna be involved in

1485.79 --> 1490.31
it pretty sure about that

1505.62 --> 1508.62
Wow

1512.28 --> 1517.11
that would be so bizarre if the

1514.35 --> 1519.98
Catholics would literally convert to

1517.11 --> 1519.9799999999998
Islam like that

1522.77 --> 1528.17
I don't think that will really work I

1525.5 --> 1532.97
think they'll cause a huge division

1528.17 --> 1536.0900000000001
it'll force a division which would be

1532.97 --> 1540.95
unprecedented but kind of in a more

1536.09 --> 1543.02
extreme form of what happened during the

1540.95 --> 1545.78
split up where the Protestants and

1543.02 --> 1549.98
everything Calvinism started to rise in

1545.78 --> 1553.1
opposition to the Catholic Church so the

1549.98 --> 1554.38
Romans will divide if that type of thing

1553.1 --> 1563.12
is enforced

1554.38 --> 1568.0900000000001
yeah the Roman Catholics so you know it

1563.12 --> 1570.9199999999998
seems like a really devastating idea but

1568.09 --> 1577.6599999999999
does that sound like that's just gonna

1570.92 --> 1577.66
happen just like that I don't think so

1578.26 --> 1586.85
it's just gonna

1581.36 --> 1589.34
yeah exposed the Vatican more I don't

1586.85 --> 1591.26
think they'll do it really I think they

1589.34 --> 1593.0
might have actually considered doing it

1591.26 --> 1594.7
I think they went along with the plan

1593.0 --> 1597.77
they might have even been the

1594.7 --> 1602.3300000000002
progenitors of the plan but I can't be

1597.77 --> 1604.94
sure of that but I just don't think that

1602.33 --> 1607.1599999999999
they'll go with roads that are not

1604.94 --> 1608.96
viable so I don't think they're really

1607.16 --> 1611.8100000000002
gonna do that anymore even though they

1608.96 --> 1618.56
were going to because it's not gonna

1611.81 --> 1621.32
work now things have changed around or

1618.56 --> 1624.23
maybe I'm being too optimistic or maybe

1621.32 --> 1627.4099999999999
it'll simply take a lot longer but will

1624.23 --> 1629.72
it still work then because it seems like

1627.41 --> 1632.1200000000001
the whole thing is being rushed and if

1629.72 --> 1634.3700000000001
it's being rushed then that must be for

1632.12 --> 1643.25
a reason there must be a reason to try

1634.37 --> 1647.4799999999998
and rush it haste but haste from their

1643.25 --> 1649.88
side only makes more people basically

1647.48 --> 1651.65
give that up and wake up from and turn

1649.88 --> 1654.3200000000002
to the other side so it's not effective

1651.65 --> 1657.26
so it almost seems like a controlled

1654.32 --> 1658.9099999999999
implosion of the plan really if you look

1657.26 --> 1659.71
at it objectively you control the

1658.91 --> 1666.14
implosion

1659.71 --> 1671.56
so then fall try to fall out presently

1666.14 --> 1674.42
and all the alternative option to that

1671.56 --> 1676.6699999999998
that'll be very easy to implement

1674.42 --> 1678.91
because they already have everything in

1676.67 --> 1678.91
place

1684.72 --> 1692.049
does that make any sense

1687.49 --> 1694.71
so I don't think yeah I don't think it's

1692.049 --> 1694.71
gonna happen like that

1695.49 --> 1700.32
what all kinds of things could happen

1701.309 --> 1708.9089999999999
I've had crazy ideas Orvis

1705.99 --> 1712.059
well there you go there you go with your

1708.909 --> 1715.0900000000001
sound bite not but I've had ideas that

1712.059 --> 1717.61
seemed like crazy to me and that I have

1715.09 --> 1721.779
no direct confirmation of but that would

1717.61 --> 1723.6399999999999
suggest that at some point and it

1721.779 --> 1725.47
doesn't make any sense to me really when

1723.64 --> 1729.0
I think about it so this may just have

1725.47 --> 1732.6100000000001
been a dark world imposed delusion that

1729.0 --> 1737.32
try to terrorize me but it suggested

1732.61 --> 1740.049
that the Christianity and this could be

1737.32 --> 1742.5
because of the dick because of the the

1740.049 --> 1745.51
Vatican the Catholics would basically be

1742.5 --> 1750.61
switched inside out like they would come

1745.51 --> 1752.74
clean with the supposed real background

1750.61 --> 1756.76
information sharing that they are

1752.74 --> 1758.86
actually Satanists and that Christianity

1756.76 --> 1766.39
is actually Satanism it sounds

1758.86 --> 1768.9699999999998
absolutely bizarre and that would then

1766.39 --> 1771.22
kind of like be quickly implemented

1768.97 --> 1774.539
almost out of fear throughout the media

1771.22 --> 1776.95
and it's gonna like completely

1774.539 --> 1779.429
demoralize everyone if that happens I

1776.95 --> 1786.64
really hope that doesn't happen

1779.429 --> 1788.23
seems very freakin creepy but yeah just

1786.64 --> 1790.51
think about it if that could somehow

1788.23 --> 1792.88
happen and Christianity would go or

1790.51 --> 1795.669
while the Vatican would go openly dark

1792.88 --> 1797.8600000000001
then the media would just grab on to

1795.669 --> 1800.8300000000002
that and they certainly become partners

1797.86 --> 1805.529
in mind-control that's a terrible

1800.83 --> 1805.529
thought that's it

1805.94 --> 1811.98
and it would almost be like imposing a

1809.04 --> 1816.6499999999999
one-world religion through media and

1811.98 --> 1820.23
unnatural religion that's inhumane and

1816.65 --> 1822.75
it would impose it autocratically

1820.23 --> 1825.45
through media mind-control but also

1822.75 --> 1826.41
maybe even through rules it's a terrible

1825.45 --> 1828.03
terrible thought

1826.41 --> 1832.74
and I hope it's never going to happen

1828.03 --> 1835.82
like that I would definitely not be able

1832.74 --> 1835.82
to survive that

1840.61 --> 1847.83
so I wouldn't worry too much about it

1843.46 --> 1853.029
it's a worst-case scenario outcome and

1847.83 --> 1858.279
as long as we haven't handed over all

1853.029 --> 1861.309
our reigns all our our options

1858.279 --> 1865.57
over to the elite out of some panic or

1861.309 --> 1867.76
some short-term need then that can never

1865.57 --> 1869.9189999999999
manifest I'm pretty confident about it

1867.76 --> 1872.11
because we'll still have some rings and

1869.919 --> 1875.46
we would just stop stop it in its tracks

1872.11 --> 1879.1299999999999
as we have with some things kind of

1875.46 --> 1884.019
through public attention so I wouldn't

1879.13 --> 1887.0800000000002
worry about it too much but maybe if you

1884.019 --> 1889.779
think like you know what you guys have

1887.08 --> 1892.33
it under control there you know we don't

1889.779 --> 1895.33
need to worry it's already done and it's

1892.33 --> 1897.97
all right well if you think like that

1895.33 --> 1901.029
then just realize that there is no

1897.97 --> 1903.039
guarantee that we can all of us like all

1901.029 --> 1905.409
the guys that even try can keep

1903.039 --> 1910.21
upholding all of this under such

1905.409 --> 1912.7600000000002
pressure and that if we don't maintain

1910.21 --> 1919.24
wide support and really try to maneuver

1912.76 --> 1923.08
our way to push them off the throne then

1919.24 --> 1928.5
we will inevitably end up like that so

1923.08 --> 1928.5
don't be too fearless about it

1933.86 --> 1942.4099999999999
so what's this done with my speech

1946.94 --> 1950.679
take a sip of this tea

1971.77 --> 1978.77
mm-hmm oh right a lianca yeah I read

1977.06 --> 1981.23
your comment there does anyone actually

1978.77 --> 1984.1399999999999
believe that the alien propaganda the

1981.23 --> 1985.04
result of space exists with we are

1984.14 --> 1987.3200000000002
insignificant

1985.04 --> 1989.78
is strong enough to make people believe

1987.32 --> 1993.6499999999999
in them and that the world religion

1989.78 --> 1995.87
ensues well that's the funny thing I

1993.65 --> 1997.7900000000002
think that there's a lot of people that

1995.87 --> 2003.61
believe in aliens because they've

1997.79 --> 2006.28
actually seen them and why they see them

2003.61 --> 2012.54
that's not a matter because I think that

2006.28 --> 2016.48
the aliens Dupre's are a manifestation

2012.54 --> 2021.31
that is derived from the other dimension

2016.48 --> 2024.01
from the dark world and how they came to

2021.31 --> 2025.78
be in that shape that's an interesting

2024.01 --> 2029.17
matter where they always like that or

2025.78 --> 2031.84
have we with our cultural focus with the

2029.17 --> 2038.43
world have we somehow manifested to them

2031.84 --> 2044.08
to be like that that they adapt to our

2038.43 --> 2047.7
cultural mindset as they might have in

2044.08 --> 2052.45
ages past adapted to the mythologies of

2047.7 --> 2055.12
what people believed in back then see so

2052.45 --> 2058.2999999999997
I think that aliens are real and the

2055.12 --> 2061.0
hylia while they are experienced let's

2058.3 --> 2063.07
just say it like that but at the same

2061.0 --> 2066.88
time the controllers have latched on to

2063.07 --> 2069.159
that image and try to make a more

2066.88 --> 2071.02
physical solid narrative with it a

2069.159 --> 2073.7200000000003
science fiction narrative that they come

2071.02 --> 2075.52
from another planet so heliocentrism so

2073.72 --> 2078.3399999999997
they made it into something physical

2075.52 --> 2083.409
literal and they are now kind of working

2078.34 --> 2085.7200000000003
a geopolitical theater game space game

2083.409 --> 2088.659
space force all that with that man in

2085.72 --> 2090.1899999999996
black but it's a game but that doesn't

2088.659 --> 2093.2200000000003
mean that people don't actually

2090.19 --> 2097.11
experience these aliens and that they

2093.22 --> 2097.1099999999997
don't experience weird sightings

2098.73 --> 2107.88
I to be fair I have personally never

2102.42 --> 2110.4900000000002
seen them never not not even in the know

2107.88 --> 2112.6400000000003
that's not true yeah I've seen them in a

2110.49 --> 2117.8289999999997
dark world but they didn't look like a

2112.64 --> 2121.91
aliens for good reason for some reason

2117.829 --> 2128.19
this sounds weird okay but because I

2121.91 --> 2130.109
kind of was aware about Flat Earth as I

2128.19 --> 2131.82
went through that even though it was

2130.109 --> 2134.19
kind of conditional in the whole product

2131.82 --> 2136.5
it's so complex how it works I didn't

2134.19 --> 2139.14
see them as aliens I just saw them just

2136.5 --> 2143.339
like I saw other extra dimensionals like

2139.14 --> 2145.41
humans that I knew it's not very nice

2143.339 --> 2147.15
but that's why they just completely

2145.41 --> 2151.14
failed to impress me I didn't see a gray

2147.15 --> 2154.859
alien at all because apparently you have

2151.14 --> 2156.8689999999997
to be converted to that belief in order

2154.859 --> 2160.109
to see them like that now would explain

2156.869 --> 2162.9300000000003
why I've basically never seen any kind

2160.109 --> 2166.68
of alien sighting I've seen freaking

2162.93 --> 2169.68
Buddha that was very special I have seen

2166.68 --> 2171.69
angels I've seen freaking fairies seeing

2169.68 --> 2174.41
pretty incredible [ __ ] but I've never

2171.69 --> 2174.41
seen an alien

2179.46 --> 2187.71
and what are you talking about yeah

2181.92 --> 2192.119
talking about complex stuff don't

2187.71 --> 2195.51
understand what you experienced yeah

2192.119 --> 2198.589
it's what I experienced is what I call

2195.51 --> 2202.4100000000003
the dark world or the dark world visions

2198.589 --> 2205.0789999999997
those were very interesting what I think

2202.41 --> 2207.089
are extra dimensional experiences and

2205.079 --> 2209.25
I've tried to figure out how they worked

2207.089 --> 2213.359
what it was that I experienced

2209.25 --> 2216.0
they were definitely drug-induced that I

2213.359 --> 2217.98
had no knowledge of basically at the

2216.0 --> 2222.77
time so I was just taking a leap of

2217.98 --> 2227.67
faith taking risk with my own sanity and

2222.77 --> 2229.559
yeah that risk turned out to be a great

2227.67 --> 2232.2000000000003
risk indeed because I didn't really know

2229.559 --> 2235.71
what I was doing and what type of people

2232.2 --> 2238.3799999999997
I was doing that with but I did have

2235.71 --> 2242.73
some pretty heavy experiences despite

2238.38 --> 2246.0
all that learned a lot and I presumably

2242.73 --> 2248.43
even saw into the future maybe my own

2246.0 --> 2252.29
future experiences it was extremely

2248.43 --> 2259.5
fascinating but also very burdensome and

2252.29 --> 2264.21
terrifying at times so this was

2259.5 --> 2266.369
completely not hallucinatory parallel to

2264.21 --> 2267.96
the waking world like so yeah the basic

2266.369 --> 2269.67
illumination is like ooh you see

2267.96 --> 2271.859
something or you see it warped or you

2269.67 --> 2275.04
see colors that's like a basic

2271.859 --> 2276.869
elucidation well this is just not a

2275.04 --> 2279.99
waking experience what I'm talking about

2276.869 --> 2281.9700000000003
this is like a dream but more like a

2279.99 --> 2282.93
lucid dream but in a lucid dream you're

2281.97 --> 2285.839
still dreaming

2282.93 --> 2287.819
you're still semi present your senses

2285.839 --> 2289.92
are just extremely clear for some reason

2287.819 --> 2291.42
and you can really focus and think about

2289.92 --> 2293.339
what you're looking at separately and

2291.42 --> 2296.25
that's not really normal

2293.339 --> 2301.0099999999998
well this experience it's like you're

2296.25 --> 2305.04
literally totally completely awake and

2301.01 --> 2308.3900000000003
present but in another realm so it's so

2305.04 --> 2311.18
much more vivid than even lucid dreaming

2308.39 --> 2312.99
but it's also very dangerous

2311.18 --> 2317.3599999999997
so that

2312.99 --> 2317.3599999999997
why I say I don't recommend it ever

2322.45 --> 2327.9399999999996
yeah well I'll yong-chol what I presumed

2325.329 --> 2330.069
it is and I have no way to exactly

2327.94 --> 2331.92
confirm what it was or what type of

2330.069 --> 2335.799
tinkering they did with it

2331.92 --> 2337.839
because they were chemists those people

2335.799 --> 2340.119
they did have understanding of chemistry

2337.839 --> 2347.109
with that stuff but they were basically

2340.119 --> 2350.67
dealing in LSD ayahuasca substances but

2347.109 --> 2353.98
they really knew what they were doing I

2350.67 --> 2357.15
didn't I could barely even understand

2353.98 --> 2357.15
what they were talking about

2366.92 --> 2370.11
[Music]

2373.74 --> 2380.91
how does this look this stuff is really

2377.07 --> 2384.869
freaky and weird and the majority of it

2380.91 --> 2390.1499999999996
is pretty much in between 20 and 15

2384.869 --> 2391.77
years ago and I still don't have a

2390.15 --> 2393.39
complete memory of what actually

2391.77 --> 2398.3
happened because most of these

2393.39 --> 2398.2999999999997
experience experiences are like

2398.33 --> 2408.69
in-between the normal time linear

2405.63 --> 2411.69
experience there you're caught in

2408.69 --> 2413.52
between it just manifests instantly but

2411.69 --> 2417.77
there's it's a fast experience so

2413.52 --> 2417.77
there's just like extra time experience

2418.76 --> 2425.4900000000002
and a lot about that experience was so

2423.03 --> 2427.9500000000003
vivid I didn't have any way to shield

2425.49 --> 2429.93
myself off like people normally can

2427.95 --> 2432.75
shield themselves against influences

2429.93 --> 2435.48
from the outside I did not have full

2432.75 --> 2437.88
capacity with that skill so everything

2435.48 --> 2441.48
really just overwhelmed me and that also

2437.88 --> 2445.08
causes me to be traumatized after it

2441.48 --> 2446.58
very much so and having instant amnesia

2445.08 --> 2449.0989999999997
induced because I basically couldn't

2446.58 --> 2452.369
handle all of it but now slipping all

2449.099 --> 2454.6800000000003
back after a long time and now it's just

2452.369 --> 2457.53
really vivid memories that are burned

2454.68 --> 2459.6299999999997
into my memory even though what I

2457.53 --> 2463.8300000000004
physically experienced during all of

2459.63 --> 2470.2200000000003
that time in my normal life I only have

2463.83 --> 2473.359
fragments and I mostly remember that I I

2470.22 --> 2477.9199999999996
really was disappointed in myself and

2473.359 --> 2481.52
that I just didn't have control over my

2477.92 --> 2484.26
my feelings towards myself especially

2481.52 --> 2486.349
but it yet they remained parallel

2484.26 --> 2490.5
experiences and I am presuming they were

2486.349 --> 2494.9100000000003
originally induced advised by some kind

2490.5 --> 2499.49
of ayahuasca substance but I've never

2494.91 --> 2499.49
bought that stuff or even sought it out

2501.13 --> 2506.9
every time I was involved in that it

2503.87 --> 2510.19
kind of overcame me through my interest

2506.9 --> 2510.19
in the occult usually

2519.32 --> 2522.98
are you listening

2527.29 --> 2532.81
right a young cook well I've shared this

2529.42 --> 2538.12
before look I always say I don't seek

2532.81 --> 2539.68
that [ __ ] out and I'm just gonna be

2538.12 --> 2543.22
honest about it because it's also very

2539.68 --> 2546.04
fascinating what I remember from it but

2543.22 --> 2550.7999999999997
it's really in the majority of it it's

2546.04 --> 2550.8
mostly been a burden and caused me to

2551.28 --> 2561.3700000000003
not be able to build a normal life

2557.88 --> 2564.6400000000003
because of the strain that came

2561.37 --> 2567.39
afterwards like the punishment I

2564.64 --> 2567.39
received

2583.06 --> 2590.09
right well Tesla Apple you know what it

2587.599 --> 2593.21
may actually be somewhat psychosis

2590.09 --> 2597.17
related but the thing about psychosis is

2593.21 --> 2599.15
I I know a lot about psychosis and I

2597.17 --> 2602.599
know how to recognize it there are

2599.15 --> 2604.88
several forms of psychosis and like the

2602.599 --> 2607.04
worst is where you literally cannot

2604.88 --> 2609.76
distinguish information anymore and that

2607.04 --> 2612.71
point people start to talk gibberish

2609.76 --> 2615.13
where he just can't see the difference

2612.71 --> 2618.77
anymore everything becomes jumbled up

2615.13 --> 2620.3900000000003
that's when you can totally lose it but

2618.77 --> 2624.44
there's other levels there is like

2620.39 --> 2626.54
obsession driven psychosis where you

2624.44 --> 2632.51
become religious and no longer think

2626.54 --> 2635.66
critically and that also can become

2632.51 --> 2638.09
paranoia it's usually just emotions that

2635.66 --> 2643.5989999999997
take control over the reasoning

2638.09 --> 2649.73
capability that can be psychotic but

2643.599 --> 2652.4300000000003
yeah the real psychosis is when your

2649.73 --> 2655.31
cognitive functions no longer really see

2652.43 --> 2657.41
when something doesn't make any sense

2655.31 --> 2660.32
well it's blatantly obvious to most

2657.41 --> 2663.3799999999997
people in a technical sense especially

2660.32 --> 2667.13
because yeah like oh this is a fact or

2663.38 --> 2669.8
this is the reality that's more opinion

2667.13 --> 2672.589
driven really in reality but when it

2669.8 --> 2674.75
comes to technical logic if you if you

2672.589 --> 2677.66
think something is technically sound and

2674.75 --> 2681.099
logical while it lately isn't that is

2677.66 --> 2681.0989999999997
also a form of psychosis

2684.28 --> 2692.03
so and I've reasoned out that basically

2688.49 --> 2696.5299999999997
the whole process that put me into those

2692.03 --> 2699.8
weird in the dark world was also it

2696.53 --> 2703.67
might have also been like psychosis

2699.8 --> 2710.27
induced in some way they certainly seem

2703.67 --> 2713.66
to terrorize me and yet definitely

2710.27 --> 2717.05
conclude that there are evil people just

2713.66 --> 2719.48
glad that I at least eventually managed

2717.05 --> 2723.6400000000003
to realize it without completely

2719.48 --> 2723.64
becoming a mind-controlled slave to them

2728.56 --> 2737.74
[Music]

2731.32 --> 2740.92
PTSD hmm all right PTSD well you can

2737.74 --> 2745.5099999999998
consider that PTSD also tends to have

2740.92 --> 2748.27
psychotic side effects that's an

2745.51 --> 2751.4500000000003
obsessive paranoia so there's very

2748.27 --> 2756.4
logical and can induce hallucinations of

2751.45 --> 2760.6299999999997
past experiences and I can pretty much

2756.4 --> 2764.53
say that I had that literally but yeah I

2760.63 --> 2766.71
didn't go to war didn't see Dalek have

2764.53 --> 2770.9500000000003
freaking explosions and all that [ __ ]

2766.71 --> 2773.65
didn't do horrifying things really in

2770.95 --> 2775.96
the reality that would cause all that no

2773.65 --> 2778.4500000000003
but I did go through those freaking dark

2775.96 --> 2781.45
world experiences and I was facing off

2778.45 --> 2788.7999999999997
with some really freaking evil things

2781.45 --> 2792.31
without protection and barely survived

2788.8 --> 2794.11
that mentally and emotionally and then

2792.31 --> 2797.5299999999997
when I came out of it yeah dead it's

2794.11 --> 2800.29
like being tortured and I was them well

2797.53 --> 2802.6800000000003
PTSD traumatized by that and that took a

2800.29 --> 2805.0299999999997
long time to basically unravel it and

2802.68 --> 2807.43
eventually it did kind of help to

2805.03 --> 2810.28
realize that most of the traumatizing

2807.43 --> 2813.16
things that I experienced there were not

2810.28 --> 2816.94
physically real because at first I

2813.16 --> 2819.2799999999997
thought they were at first let's say the

2816.94 --> 2822.16
first ten years I didn't even realize

2819.28 --> 2824.8300000000004
that those experience I had were not

2822.16 --> 2828.8799999999997
physically real I just thought it was

2824.83 --> 2830.86
all one real thing until I basically

2828.88 --> 2835.03
figured out like wait I remember these

2830.86 --> 2838.06
kind of locations and I know where they

2835.03 --> 2841.36
are supposedly but they're not there

2838.06 --> 2845.29
they're not like that it's like a region

2841.36 --> 2848.98
is real and then it forms into something

2845.29 --> 2852.49
slightly different and in reality that's

2848.98 --> 2855.94
not there it is so weird how that

2852.49 --> 2858.16
sometimes were really surreal but at the

2855.94 --> 2861.85
time I didn't know those regions all too

2858.16 --> 2864.5899999999997
well and I didn't notice that they were

2861.85 --> 2868.37
likely not

2864.59 --> 2870.81
not actually in the physical real-world

2868.37 --> 2873.1099999999997
it was in the dark world but I didn't

2870.81 --> 2873.11
know that

2878.93 --> 2886.47
so yeah got a lot into the weird dark

2882.24 --> 2891.8999999999996
world thing again dad some I've talked

2886.47 --> 2895.3199999999997
about that a lot but it seems like a

2891.9 --> 2897.96
dangerous subject to me especially

2895.32 --> 2899.8500000000004
because I guess it is kind of really

2897.96 --> 2902.91
interesting I even find it interesting

2899.85 --> 2906.0299999999997
but at the same time that almost seems

2902.91 --> 2908.25
bad to me like I'm not happy that I find

2906.03 --> 2910.77
it so fascinating because that may

2908.25 --> 2913.58
encourage others to like oh god I want

2910.77 --> 2921.21
to try this well literally it's hell

2913.58 --> 2923.5499999999997
okay so no don't be an idiot it's much

2921.21 --> 2926.55
more effective to actually apply the

2923.55 --> 2930.42
energies of how you are resolve problems

2926.55 --> 2934.86
and then build that up instead of

2930.42 --> 2938.0
getting a giant whiplash on your spirit

2934.86 --> 2941.1
by something that is just too big just

2938.0 --> 2945.03
with the off chance that you might climb

2941.1 --> 2946.92
out of that and become more refined than

2945.03 --> 2949.38
you would have become if you hadn't

2946.92 --> 2951.39
experienced that because that is seems

2949.38 --> 2956.33
to be kind of like the choice I made but

2951.39 --> 2959.6099999999997
I wonder a lot if it was ever worth it

2956.33 --> 2962.6
now of course when I talk about this

2959.61 --> 2967.29
like for example ayahuasca it's even

2962.6 --> 2969.36
more normalized I guess the idea like oh

2967.29 --> 2972.24
yeah you can take that with the shaman

2969.36 --> 2976.9700000000003
and can be therapeutical can even get

2972.24 --> 2980.39
away PTSD and I I have never tried that

2976.97 --> 2984.56
I've only basically experienced through

2980.39 --> 2987.6299999999997
through not very reliable dark

2984.56 --> 2990.5
individuals that's this so I don't know

2987.63 --> 2993.3900000000003
how that is I don't want to poopoo Oh

2990.5 --> 2995.269
everything about ayahuasca because I

2993.39 --> 2998.3289999999997
haven't experienced that

2995.269 --> 3001.569
set up and I've even thought like maybe

2998.329 --> 3005.0190000000002
that does really work maybe I could even

3001.569 --> 3007.39
kind of like remove some of the shadow

3005.019 --> 3010.029
of the experiences that I had to

3007.39 --> 3012.249
basically allow myself to grow a little

3010.029 --> 3014.769
bit more in spirit toward something more

3012.249 --> 3018.069
constructive instead of just constantly

3014.769 --> 3024.5989999999997
having to hold the memories of the

3018.069 --> 3024.599
shadows I'd I wonder if that's possible

3031.19 --> 3038.21
but then again for example my healer

3035.29 --> 3042.85
highly recommends against that so I do

3038.21 --> 3042.85
also have to take into account that and

3043.81 --> 3050.99
if I did that for example what would I

3047.84 --> 3056.9300000000003
risk happen would I for example lose my

3050.99 --> 3061.22
my super detail focus I don't know it

3056.93 --> 3065.1499999999996
could completely rearrange my balance so

3061.22 --> 3069.3199999999997
if I ever even truly am going to do that

3065.15 --> 3072.1
I have to be very very focused very

3069.32 --> 3077.44
aware very aware of the consequences

3072.1 --> 3077.44
before I ever even consider it really

3078.43 --> 3085.3999999999996
and yeah it's not on my priority list

3082.58 --> 3088.2999999999997
just let's just put it like that for a

3085.4 --> 3092.26
lot more things to do before I even

3088.3 --> 3092.26
start to ponder upon that

3111.37 --> 3114.3599999999997
I don't know

3118.1 --> 3124.52
monotheism pantheism I think it's all

3121.31 --> 3127.0099999999998
basically personification I think the

3124.52 --> 3132.08
issue is personification really if you

3127.01 --> 3135.88
just think creator and how it is the

3132.08 --> 3138.77
Alpha and the Omega all things then I

3135.88 --> 3141.4700000000003
think that is the most important

3138.77 --> 3145.91
condition really that you're aware of

3141.47 --> 3149.0499999999997
that and then you can take on an example

3145.91 --> 3152.2999999999997
and every example has a certain effect

3149.05 --> 3156.59
on yourself and on the world and a

3152.3 --> 3159.67
certain result and everybody chooses

3156.59 --> 3160.8500000000004
their own way and you can like be a

3159.67 --> 3163.4
pantheist

3160.85 --> 3167.66
or whatever direction some kind of older

3163.4 --> 3169.67
religion and that doesn't necessarily

3167.66 --> 3172.52
have to mean that you are then

3169.67 --> 3175.07
completely doomed I think it's all much

3172.52 --> 3177.38
more about the frequency and the methods

3175.07 --> 3180.29
you apply in the actual consequences of

3177.38 --> 3182.65
those things not the story that guides

3180.29 --> 3182.65
them

3187.49 --> 3195.1699999999996
I basically respond to do people speak

3192.01 --> 3197.4500000000003
the right energy the the right frequency

3195.17 --> 3200.15
the right truth without dangers without

3197.45 --> 3203.66
something that'll eventually invert that

3200.15 --> 3209.12
energy naturally because of the

3203.66 --> 3211.58
circumstances is the energy a narrow

3209.12 --> 3215.06
path basically or at a narrow path

3211.58 --> 3218.2
towards crud of Christ as an example or

3215.06 --> 3220.4
another mythical figure very similar

3218.2 --> 3222.2599999999998
does it matter it's about the

3220.4 --> 3226.6600000000003
methodology it's about the frequency

3222.26 --> 3230.2700000000004
it's about the narrowness and this and

3226.66 --> 3236.27
the avoidance the fighting against

3230.27 --> 3238.63
seductions and obsessions that's what I

3236.27 --> 3238.63
think

3239.85 --> 3242.989
[Music]

3243.24 --> 3249.0899999999997
and yeah getting those things out of the

3246.58 --> 3252.88
way the things that make you obsess and

3249.09 --> 3256.48
focus on what is natural and wise and

3252.88 --> 3266.4300000000003
constructive I think that is the what

3256.48 --> 3266.43
the true path is all about yeah

3274.41 --> 3285.42
huh uber Mukul I I wouldn't over

3280.829 --> 3287.67
generalize that that depression medica

3285.42 --> 3290.579
you know what most depression medication

3287.67 --> 3294.299
is right it's actually fluoride based or

3290.579 --> 3300.96
at least the prozac literally fluoride

3294.299 --> 3304.2
sodium fluoride based and MDMA is a

3300.96 --> 3306.9
completely disappear psychotropic

3304.2 --> 3309.89
interact interacting substance it's

3306.9 --> 3309.89
different

3313.97 --> 3325.4599999999996
lithium and all that stuff what it does

3317.07 --> 3331.65
is basically suppress or like railroad a

3325.46 --> 3334.9700000000003
different more unwavering type of mood

3331.65 --> 3338.4
and forcing the moods and basically

3334.97 --> 3342.14
interrupting the normal mood energy

3338.4 --> 3345.06
cycle and that's really disruptive

3342.14 --> 3347.52
that's what all the the antidepressants

3345.06 --> 3350.0
do but MDMA does something completely

3347.52 --> 3353.25
different MDMA is like a transform

3350.0 --> 3358.17
formation process you could compare it I

3353.25 --> 3360.57
guess to cannabinoids also but they more

3358.17 --> 3364.9500000000003
physical oriented metabolic all

3360.57 --> 3368.4900000000002
transformation effect it's getting rid

3364.95 --> 3370.68
of cancers all that and MDMA what it

3368.49 --> 3374.6
does is does that specifically to the

3370.68 --> 3378.6
pineal gland and like the spiritual

3374.6 --> 3381.99
rearrangement the spiritual entanglement

3378.6 --> 3385.08
of the nerves I think that is what that

3381.99 --> 3387.12
does specifically and in it you get this

3385.08 --> 3392.22
amazing experience it's like you are

3387.12 --> 3394.5299999999997
your spirit is set on from this gains

3392.22 --> 3397.37
extra energy like from the other

3394.53 --> 3400.02
dimension that's how I experienced it

3397.37 --> 3403.98
with mile dosage is because I didn't

3400.02 --> 3405.93
always get overkill amount but that's

3403.98 --> 3407.4
how it felt like you're getting an

3405.93 --> 3409.14
energy from the extra dimension it's

3407.4 --> 3412.2000000000003
really like everything is just enhanced

3409.14 --> 3414.0299999999997
and even the really basic LSD is known

3412.2 --> 3416.1299999999997
to do that is first to enhance the

3414.03 --> 3421.6400000000003
senses and you feel like you're getting

3416.13 --> 3421.6400000000003
a lot of energy it's very

3422.08 --> 3430.7999999999997
warming in a way but yeah you don't get

3426.76 --> 3430.8
dark world experiences from that

3443.79 --> 3450.96
Wow thank you Looby do Looby loo that's

3448.47 --> 3455.8799999999997
that's ice that's an amazing compliment

3450.96 --> 3458.1
thank you it says love your show by the

3455.88 --> 3462.78
way you are more eloquent in English

3458.1 --> 3465.29
than most native English speakers I do

3462.78 --> 3465.2900000000004
my best

3466.07 --> 3471.6200000000003
although I do find a lot of dick

3468.87 --> 3475.92
different types of English accents very

3471.62 --> 3485.91
charming although sometimes a little bit

3475.92 --> 3488.4
difficult to follow I if I could if I

3485.91 --> 3489.66
really trained it I'd love to speak like

3488.4 --> 3492.57
Oxford English

3489.66 --> 3495.42
I'm very charmed by that form of laying

3492.57 --> 3497.19
language it is I guess also the thing

3495.42 --> 3500.2200000000003
that I really appreciate about rumpus

3497.19 --> 3503.04
because when he's not when he's not

3500.22 --> 3505.14
jittering when he's just calm then he's

3503.04 --> 3511.4
so well-spoken really the Oxford English

3505.14 --> 3519.54
type very precise and meticulous and

3511.4 --> 3522.57
more fluently than then I get it so to

3519.54 --> 3525.14
each their own but thank you again for

3522.57 --> 3525.1400000000003
the compliment

3530.769 --> 3540.4889999999996
well thank you for that as well I

3534.16 --> 3540.489
wouldn't say an amazing lexicon blot

3543.64 --> 3552.27
I think I've just had so much experience

3547.77 --> 3556.81
with listening very very attentively to

3552.27 --> 3559.57
real English speakers and we in the

3556.81 --> 3563.71
Netherlands I my generation actually had

3559.57 --> 3565.2400000000002
a unique opportunity it's because now in

3563.71 --> 3567.01
the Netherlands like all the cartoons

3565.24 --> 3570.6899999999996
and everything it's just Dutch

3567.01 --> 3573.1600000000003
programming sometimes you have a movie

3570.69 --> 3574.96
and I'm talking about television because

3573.16 --> 3577.21
that's still out there mostly for the

3574.96 --> 3579.73
oldies there's just Dutch spoken

3577.21 --> 3581.44
programmes there's movies or series

3579.73 --> 3585.4900000000002
sometimes English and then it's with

3581.44 --> 3587.38
Dutch subtitles or it's cartoons and

3585.49 --> 3592.87
everything's just Dutch spoken but in my

3587.38 --> 3595.9
day we had it's like ooh look we got a

3592.87 --> 3596.89
present from America look they got

3595.9 --> 3599.77
cartoons

3596.89 --> 3602.17
some of them taken from Japan made their

3599.77 --> 3604.39
own and we were like given that as a

3602.17 --> 3606.82
present and we were very appreciative of

3604.39 --> 3610.15
that and as a he was very appreciated of

3606.82 --> 3613.4100000000003
it so I got to see all these cartoons as

3610.15 --> 3616.57
a little little kid like from six and on

3613.41 --> 3619.21
that for all English spoken and pretty

3616.57 --> 3622.02
basic English it was kind of done if you

3619.21 --> 3626.32
see it now but I was a little kid and

3622.02 --> 3628.36
that was my very inspiring English

3626.32 --> 3630.82
teacher I love those frickin cartoons

3628.36 --> 3634.35
Saturday morning I would get up seven

3630.82 --> 3637.54
o'clock I would hate getting up at like

3634.35 --> 3638.2
nine o'clock to go to school well oh

3637.54 --> 3641.74
yeah

3638.2 --> 3646.21
Saturday morning 7 o'clock you bet I was

3641.74 --> 3649.77
up cartoons English cartoons all kinds

3646.21 --> 3655.18
of English cartoons space battles and

3649.77 --> 3658.57
fantasies [ __ ] and awesome but that is

3655.18 --> 3662.83
how I got so exposed with English very

3658.57 --> 3665.23
young and it made me really enthusiastic

3662.83 --> 3668.2
to want to kind of be able to speak the

3665.23 --> 3670.2400000000002
language so I I decided very young like

3668.2 --> 3672.6099999999997
I am gonna be really good at English I

3670.24 --> 3674.89
want that I'm not too good at the other

3672.61 --> 3675.3900000000003
languages I'd never really they never

3674.89 --> 3679.98
really

3675.39 --> 3686.1299999999997
I tried Spanish it it slipped away again

3679.98 --> 3690.96
I tried German yeah also slipped away

3686.13 --> 3694.4100000000003
again it's just I can kind of follow the

3690.96 --> 3696.75
other languages I kind of get with

3694.41 --> 3700.5899999999997
Spanish with French and with German I

3696.75 --> 3702.75
can pretty much decently make out at

3700.59 --> 3705.69
some point what what is the kind of what

3702.75 --> 3707.55
they're talking about but I can't just

3705.69 --> 3709.38
speaking it I might get the accent right

3707.55 --> 3712.3500000000004
if I have like the right sentence I

3709.38 --> 3714.51
could read out French and probably be

3712.35 --> 3717.2999999999997
very accurate with it or relatively

3714.51 --> 3720.8700000000003
accurate but actually understanding it

3717.3 --> 3722.4
is something different I'd have to

3720.87 --> 3726.0299999999997
figure it out but English I've always

3722.4 --> 3730.65
been good at it I just kept on learning

3726.03 --> 3734.4
and learning and learning and always

3730.65 --> 3740.51
been more interested in English spoken

3734.4 --> 3746.73
music more interested in English spoken

3740.51 --> 3750.2400000000002
TV movies but there's like for example

3746.73 --> 3755.28
some Dutch movies that I do kind of

3750.24 --> 3757.14
appreciate but not a lot compared to

3755.28 --> 3760.53
English stuff I've just been a big fan

3757.14 --> 3762.99
of the United States and an England even

3760.53 --> 3764.76
England especially their their nature

3762.99 --> 3768.8999999999996
documentaries in the nineties were just

3764.76 --> 3775.6200000000003
amazing and not so propagandized as they

3768.9 --> 3779.7200000000003
are now so yeah man Brad dragging on
