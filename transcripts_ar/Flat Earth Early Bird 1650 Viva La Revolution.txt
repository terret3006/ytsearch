through that

101.28 --> 107.6

104.34 --> 107.60000000000001
yesterday all evening

117.479 --> 121.979
all the plants and the grass and all

119.28 --> 124.56
that are getting a lot of water

121.979 --> 127.579
to recover from the heat wave that

124.56 --> 127.57900000000001
preceded all this

127.86 --> 130.399
right

133.319 --> 137.54
uh literally first in chat

139.739 --> 146.09900000000002

148.5 --> 151.04
right

153.12 --> 159.12
so in America

155.58 --> 161.459

[Music]

181.459 --> 186.42000000000002
I think maybe independence day is just

184.14 --> 189.6
more about this Spirit of

186.42 --> 192.11999999999998
Independence not actual Independence

189.6 --> 194.72
[Music]

192.12 --> 194.72
yeah

194.879 --> 197.29999999999998
okay

205.92 --> 211.61999999999998
hello dank Oz good to see you all how

209.819 --> 213.78
are you guys doing

211.62 --> 217.04
I'm doing okay

213.78 --> 217.04
not eating a lot

217.86 --> 221.0
but I don't know

226.379 --> 228.98
hmm

240.78 --> 247.26
before that yeah I mean

244.099 --> 249.92
uh there's a lot going on in the world

247.26 --> 249.92
right now

253.14 --> 258.18
farmers are going for another round of

256.44 --> 260.459
more serious protests here in the

258.18 --> 263.66
Netherlands

260.459 --> 263.66
just been announced

271.919 --> 278.46
by the farmer's Defense Force

274.68 --> 281.34000000000003
yeah and like the whole France situation

278.46 --> 284.09999999999997
has been going all over the internet I

281.34 --> 285.9
mean every [ __ ] person on the

284.1 --> 287.46000000000004
internet is talking about it out there

285.9 --> 289.73999999999995
now

287.46 --> 292.4
and they're all pretty much concluding

289.74 --> 292.40000000000003
the same thing

293.1 --> 298.8
like yeah you invited in the scum of the

296.639 --> 300.78000000000003
earth and rejects from another country

298.8 --> 303.0
and and then they

300.78 --> 305.59999999999997
did not adapt and they just want to

303.0 --> 305.6
conquer you

306.479 --> 309.84
right

308.22 --> 312.72
yeah by the way I'm getting some weird

309.84 --> 315.08
issues for I should probably email them

312.72 --> 318.47900000000004
I'm getting weird issues with

315.08 --> 322.56
unauthorized.tv like

318.479 --> 325.68
my payment doesn't seem to work

322.56 --> 327.24
even though it should and it has worked

325.68 --> 331.699
in the past so

327.24 --> 331.699
either my bank has literally blocked

333.0 --> 339.3
the ability to pay an authorize.tv which

336.419 --> 342.59999999999997
is like really [ __ ] up

339.3 --> 344.759
or there's something wrong with their

342.6 --> 346.56
system I don't know what it is but it's

344.759 --> 350.12
kind of annoying I had to

346.56 --> 350.12
watch on D live

350.58 --> 356.4
because that's still live

353.639 --> 359.1
but yeah yeah I can't comment there so

356.4 --> 360.539
that's that was kind of annoying

359.1 --> 363.0
I had a good show though yesterday

360.539 --> 364.979
started really late though that was a

363.0 --> 367.08
bit annoying

364.979 --> 369.9
but a good show

367.08 --> 373.02
hey bumbaclad Gator fish man it's been

369.9 --> 375.979
ages since I've seen you

373.02 --> 375.979
how are you doing

384.23 --> 394.569
[Music]

396.66 --> 401.16
all right yeah no yesterday no flat

399.419 --> 403.639
Earth debates Nathan's computer was

401.16 --> 403.639
completely

403.86 --> 412.44
[ __ ] it just wasn't able to do it

408.96 --> 416.52
hopefully today he said he was gonna

412.44 --> 416.52
have some things fixed

418.319 --> 423.97900000000004
oh no live stream today either

421.38 --> 423.979
[ __ ]

431.759 --> 437.22
oh wow okay well

435.36 --> 441.24
from the looks of it there might not be

437.22 --> 443.09900000000005
any Flat Earth debates the entire week

441.24 --> 445.94
maybe Friday

443.099 --> 445.94
or something

446.4 --> 451.67999999999995
ah goody

449.46 --> 454.38
well at least the Flat Earth early bird

451.68 --> 457.08
show will keep going

454.38 --> 460.8
so maybe I have to talk more about Flat

457.08 --> 463.94
Earth or or you'll start to Twitch

460.8 --> 463.94
by the end of the week

468.3 --> 476.0
well shaking off the Sleepy Vibe right

471.539 --> 476.0
are you in the United States I take it

479.819 --> 484.44
no need to debate yeah but there is a

482.099 --> 486.539
need to I don't know to yell at

484.44 --> 489.5
anti-flat earthers

486.539 --> 489.5
I know that

490.259 --> 494.34000000000003
yeah the guys work by the way from

492.479 --> 496.62
flutter thread kind of hanging over at

494.34 --> 501.73999999999995
flat zoids

496.62 --> 501.74
I did watch like a half a flat side show

502.319 --> 506.06
and heard Adam Lincoln and

507.199 --> 514.38
some other Neo in there so they kind of

510.419 --> 517.8
were like hey we want to do our thing so

514.38 --> 520.52
we'll just do it in your show flat so it

517.8 --> 520.52
uh

523.56 --> 526.8599999999999
all right your slave job this morning

525.54 --> 530.12
okay

526.86 --> 530.12
East Coast okay

530.7 --> 534.44
all right well that's still doable

535.62 --> 539.34
West Coast it's going to be like middle

537.42 --> 542.539
of the night

539.34 --> 542.539
[Music]

545.18 --> 550.92
right well I hope to alleviate you of

548.82 --> 553.2
some of the boredom of pure

550.92 --> 558.56
slave job

553.2 --> 558.5600000000001
hopefully I mean I do feel pretty good

559.08 --> 561.62
uh

562.08 --> 566.94
I'm all stocked up on stuff got an

564.839 --> 568.8000000000001
Illuminati I saw again

566.94 --> 571.08
woohoo

568.8 --> 573.8389999999999
some roccola

571.08 --> 576.4200000000001
and even a crystal energy drink although

573.839 --> 578.399
with this temperature I don't think I'm

576.42 --> 581.04
actually gonna drink it but I just have

578.399 --> 583.26
it just in case I want to

581.04 --> 586.68
if I get really steamed up and I really

583.26 --> 588.72
need some refreshment after that

586.68 --> 590.88
uh

588.72 --> 594.32
and conversation is always appreciate oh

590.88 --> 594.32
thank you thank you for saying that

599.88 --> 606.779
early bird is a good name for the yes

602.88 --> 609.12
yes thank you that's the reason

606.779 --> 612.54
I'm calling it The Flat Earth early bird

609.12 --> 615.08
show for America that's right doing it

612.54 --> 615.0799999999999
for America

623.399 --> 628.32
because I don't know but I for some

626.1 --> 630.4200000000001
reason maybe it's because of the way

628.32 --> 633.899
that I speak English which is very

630.42 --> 636.5999999999999
American it's I don't speak British

633.899 --> 640.08
and it's definitely new don't go and do

636.6 --> 642.0600000000001
the accident or you know I don't do that

640.08 --> 644.5790000000001
it's very uncomfortable

642.06 --> 646.7399999999999
so I kind of stick to American

644.579 --> 649.38
and that probably makes it more

646.74 --> 652.32
appealing to Americans too I'm probably

649.38 --> 655.079
more appealing to Americans because my

652.32 --> 658.0400000000001
accent is much more American

655.079 --> 658.04
oriented

658.62 --> 663.66
and I can do a bit of British but just

661.32 --> 666.4200000000001
don't say right you know

663.66 --> 670.14
a dog it doesn't come out right

666.42 --> 672.42
and all these bloody inflat inflictions

670.14 --> 676.079
like inflections

672.42 --> 678.4799999999999
are kind of getting on my nerves

676.079 --> 683.279
like I'm not good at it like British

678.48 --> 685.6800000000001
doing English is is a pretty doable

683.279 --> 687.18
language it really is it is one of the

685.68 --> 688.68
more doable language that's why it's

687.18 --> 691.38
been so successful around the world

688.68 --> 692.9399999999999
that's why a lot of languages have also

691.38 --> 694.38
English beside that because it's so

692.94 --> 699.0
doable

694.38 --> 702.12
now speaking like a British person

699.0 --> 705.899
that's another matter

702.12 --> 707.12
that is [ __ ] complicated as hell I

705.899 --> 711.24
mean

707.12 --> 714.74
properly British is more difficult than

711.24 --> 714.74
speaking Dutch

714.779 --> 720.42
trust me

717.3 --> 723.26
is very difficult

720.42 --> 725.76
I mean you can do the surface

723.26 --> 729.3
you know the surface

725.76 --> 732.3
cutting off tones and that that's doable

729.3 --> 735.12
but actually doing all the other tricks

732.3 --> 737.579
they do I it's so [ __ ] difficult it's

735.12 --> 739.5600000000001
not doable I mean it makes effectively

737.579 --> 743.8199999999999
Oxford British

739.56 --> 746.6999999999999
like what how Darth Vader speaks much

743.82 --> 748.44
or like does Darth Vader's Oxford well

746.7 --> 750.779
Oxford English is like very clear

748.44 --> 753.72
English and that's much more easy to

750.779 --> 756.72
comprehend than actually accented

753.72 --> 759.1800000000001
British like for example Paul Cook and

756.72 --> 760.86
he's a pretty awesome guy I think

759.18 --> 765.5
very British

760.86 --> 768.0600000000001
very spunky it is like a

765.5 --> 770.04
old-fashioned type British guy to me at

768.06 --> 772.4399999999999
least blonde and all that he does his

770.04 --> 774.12
streams about uh

772.44 --> 777.4200000000001
well about

774.12 --> 779.519
monolithic structures and how it's been

777.42 --> 783.06
made through composite stone and all

779.519 --> 786.36
this very but he has that really thick

783.06 --> 788.579
British accent and like

786.36 --> 791.82
when he doesn't like really make effort

788.579 --> 794.2199999999999
to speak out which he doesn't really do

791.82 --> 796.8000000000001
then it just like sometimes just can't

794.22 --> 799.5
tell what the [ __ ] he's saying because

796.8 --> 802.74
he just sled really thick British accent

799.5 --> 805.279
and it's just like ah what are you

802.74 --> 805.279
saying man

806.04 --> 811.92
right it's almost as terrible or as

808.68 --> 814.7399999999999
difficult as Scottish

811.92 --> 818.399
I mean English is really not that much

814.74 --> 820.98
more complicated than Scottish accent

818.399 --> 823.26
I think anyway

820.98 --> 826.74
I still love the Brits though

823.26 --> 829.079
the old-fashioned ones the newer the

826.74 --> 833.3
weenie boy Brits they suck

829.079 --> 833.3
but like the old types are awesome

833.459 --> 838.6899999999999
anyway

835.49 --> 838.69
[Music]

839.339 --> 843.48
same goes for the Netherlands and there

841.56 --> 847.279
are like a lot of weenie boy nettle

843.48 --> 851.4590000000001
Dutch people that are just terrible

847.279 --> 854.579
and whiny but there's also still just

851.459 --> 857.88
kind of more much more silent

854.579 --> 859.019
very awesome guys that do their job

857.88 --> 862.74
great

859.019 --> 865.86
and without complaints and

862.74 --> 868.86
and they look good and healthy and

865.86 --> 871.32
they're helpful like there's plenty of

868.86 --> 872.88
that too there's really freaking awesome

871.32 --> 874.8000000000001
Dutch guys

872.88 --> 878.639
like that make me like

874.8 --> 882.38
like feel like I'm a young it makes me

878.639 --> 882.38
get that younger brother feeling

882.42 --> 887.9399999999999
because I don't know I am not really

884.82 --> 889.6800000000001
like that unfortunately I am like half

887.94 --> 891.899
the whiny type

889.68 --> 895.26
although I do make a lot of personal

891.899 --> 897.66
effort to not whine to people

895.26 --> 900.3
because I hate it when people whine to

897.66 --> 903.92
me and so I'm assuming that people are

900.3 --> 903.92
gonna hate it when I whine to them

905.279 --> 907.82
anyway

912.779 --> 917.399
right hand radio

915.0 --> 919.8
yeah I saw that but there was literally

917.399 --> 921.66
nothing happening in there that was

919.8 --> 924.199
weird

921.66 --> 924.199
yesterday

928.82 --> 933.48
a joke

931.019 --> 935.279
I don't think they say that there jock

933.48 --> 937.38
is not really a word that British people

935.279 --> 940.16
use

937.38 --> 940.16
it's very American

945.54 --> 950.48
you've seen him flat smatting people

950.76 --> 956.579
I can't yeah it's just that the way

953.279 --> 960.72
British talk it's it they construct

956.579 --> 962.519
their sentences differently

960.72 --> 964.8000000000001
ah

962.519 --> 967.019
so sometimes if if somebody didn't

964.8 --> 969.3
intend to speak British and it's just

967.019 --> 972.66
saying it like an American you can even

969.3 --> 974.459
then say that with the British accent

972.66 --> 977.399
because it just doesn't work because

974.459 --> 979.8199999999999
it's not constructed like a British

977.399 --> 979.82
sentence

980.699 --> 985.929
anyway

982.76 --> 985.929
[Music]

988.92 --> 992.5999999999999
hey more colored good to see you

997.5 --> 1002.24
Scottish Oz

999.779 --> 1006.279
Gordon Ramsay

1002.24 --> 1006.279
Gordon Ramsay Scottish huh

1006.86 --> 1010.36
okay I didn't know that

1012.92 --> 1019.5999999999999
huh all right well yeah sure why not

1029.609 --> 1033.4389999999999
[Music]

1031.339 --> 1035.0
you know that's hilarious more colored

1033.439 --> 1039.28
thanks

1035.0 --> 1039.28
I'm gonna Chow Down some of this rookola

1063.95 --> 1067.069
[Music]

1074.539 --> 1079.34
yes bomb McLeod Gator fish

1078.2 --> 1082.5800000000002
but

1079.34 --> 1085.4599999999998
a jock is also a reference to the types

1082.58 --> 1087.5
that typically play football so it looks

1085.46 --> 1090.52
like a jock doesn't literally have to

1087.5 --> 1090.52
mean he plays football

1091.64 --> 1095.38
is just built for that

1095.96 --> 1099.5
um

1097.0 --> 1102.88
[Music]

1099.5 --> 1102.88
translate oh okay

1104.0 --> 1106.66
foreign

1106.78 --> 1110.86
how to pronounce it properly

1117.679 --> 1123.38
I still find it very hilarious that

1120.74 --> 1126.799
British but especially Americans just

1123.38 --> 1127.7600000000002
can't do the Dutch fouls they just can't

1126.799 --> 1130.539
do it

1127.76 --> 1130.539
it's like

1131.24 --> 1135.2
to them it's it's more like making like

1133.52 --> 1137.6
a bird sound or something something

1135.2 --> 1140.6000000000001
really unnatural

1137.6 --> 1143.299
but for us that's just that's normal it

1140.6 --> 1147.52
like we don't understand why you left

1143.299 --> 1147.52
those types of sounds out of your system

1151.7 --> 1154.1200000000001
okay

1155.6 --> 1162.02
oh a jock this is

1158.66 --> 1165.4
sweaty so what the [ __ ] okay okay I

1162.02 --> 1165.4
didn't know that Waters boy

1167.24 --> 1174.34
okay so I guess that the British have a

1170.0 --> 1174.34
whole other interpretation of that word

1176.84 --> 1180.4399999999998
that's weird

1178.28 --> 1182.1789999999999
and very typical of course they have

1180.44 --> 1184.76
completely different meanings that are

1182.179 --> 1186.74
only they get it yeah that makes sense

1184.76 --> 1189.559
they're going to use all the same words

1186.74 --> 1191.72
except completely different and it makes

1189.559 --> 1194.059
perfect sense to them and nobody out

1191.72 --> 1196.46
there even knows that they

1194.059 --> 1200.5
that that's how they're using it

1196.46 --> 1200.5
like that's so freaking British

1203.299 --> 1207.039
you can say it right okay

1210.98 --> 1214.6
I don't know more than

1215.5 --> 1221.419
that's not a very

1218.48 --> 1223.78
easy thing for English people to

1221.419 --> 1223.7800000000002
pronounce

1226.28 --> 1230.6789999999999
yeah because they go to org Oregon

1231.039 --> 1235.9
that's something that you're very easy

1233.36 --> 1235.8999999999999
to do but

1237.16 --> 1240.46
yeah without

1241.1 --> 1246.08
working up phlegm or

1244.7 --> 1247.7
I mean

1246.08 --> 1250.6999999999998
good luck

1247.7 --> 1253.179
yes you can okay I'd like to hear that

1250.7 --> 1253.179
sometime

1267.26 --> 1270.46
yeah the AL

1271.7 --> 1274.48
o

1274.64 --> 1283.48
a a a a a oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah

1280.64 --> 1283.48
good luck with that

1284.419 --> 1289.3400000000001
yeah that was all very distinctly

1286.82 --> 1293.1399999999999
different sounds that are very integral

1289.34 --> 1293.1399999999999
to the general language Dutch

1293.62 --> 1298.039
o a

1295.82 --> 1301.48
o

1298.039 --> 1301.48
yeah that's all different

1303.679 --> 1310.88
although o and O that's really weird to

1307.94 --> 1313.039
you that's that's probably like no

1310.88 --> 1316.159
that's the same

1313.039 --> 1318.799
it's just a micron different yeah yeah

1316.159 --> 1321.98
well the Chinese have that kind of weird

1318.799 --> 1325.539
detail inflection differences too

1321.98 --> 1325.539
very important to them too

1327.44 --> 1332.559
not really bro

1329.96 --> 1332.559
what

1334.1 --> 1338.26
can draw my R's like a Spanish person

1338.84 --> 1342.22
like a Spanish person

1344.24 --> 1347.24
I

1354.86 --> 1360.4399999999998
am easy to do oh okay well yeah sure Mr

1358.58 --> 1364.34
braggy pants

1360.44 --> 1367.94
I'd like to hear I'd like to see you

1364.34 --> 1370.3999999999999
record a Dutch sentence and actually and

1367.94 --> 1372.6200000000001
actually do it like a Dutch person good

1370.4 --> 1375.3200000000002
luck with that

1372.62 --> 1378.82
yeah and I'm not even bringing in the

1375.32 --> 1382.6589999999999
damn accents okay because that just

1378.82 --> 1382.6589999999999
completely [ __ ] it up

1388.7 --> 1392.5
you sound [ __ ]

1393.74 --> 1396.34
okay

1403.12 --> 1407.32
you guys are in a weird mood

1409.1 --> 1415.6
working on your Spanish cool

1412.159 --> 1415.6000000000001
I should work on my Spanish

1419.179 --> 1426.52
but I can follow Spanish decently I can

1422.6 --> 1426.52
follow it as well as I can follow German

1426.679 --> 1431.96
I just can't really speak it

1429.62 --> 1435.799
I can get the accents right but I don't

1431.96 --> 1437.539
know how to properly construct sentences

1435.799 --> 1438.8799999999999
same goes with German like that's the

1437.539 --> 1440.12
where the problem is

1438.88 --> 1442.22
[Music]

1440.12 --> 1444.26
the weird thing is I'm not really all

1442.22 --> 1446.98
that talented in language I always had a

1444.26 --> 1446.98
lot of trouble with it

1450.02 --> 1453.98
except for English

1452.299 --> 1455.6
and Dutch

1453.98 --> 1458.059
I was good at that

1455.6 --> 1459.62
the other ones difficult

1458.059 --> 1461.539
very difficult it's just they couldn't

1459.62 --> 1463.8999999999999
focus

1461.539 --> 1467.84
although I did become very good at

1463.9 --> 1471.2
recognizing the language it's like I can

1467.84 --> 1472.6
pretty much hear anybody from

1471.2 --> 1475.5800000000002
like

1472.6 --> 1479.6589999999999
Greece Italy

1475.58 --> 1482.74
Spain or Portugal hear them talk and

1479.659 --> 1487.0590000000002
then pretty pretty accurately identify

1482.74 --> 1487.059
where which country they came from

1487.28 --> 1490.36
pretty good at that

1490.58 --> 1497.78
but I can't actually speak it

1494.419 --> 1500.2990000000002
or really understand it

1497.78 --> 1502.34
like when it gets complex I mean The

1500.299 --> 1505.52
Superficial hello good weather language

1502.34 --> 1507.6789999999999
that's very doable but I mean when

1505.52 --> 1510.26
they're gonna start to talk like more

1507.679 --> 1512.6000000000001
complicated explanatory explanatory

1510.26 --> 1513.919
things that's when I just kind of lose

1512.6 --> 1516.4599999999998
track

1513.919 --> 1516.46
anyway

1526.34 --> 1532.34
yeah English only because they yeah they

1529.88 --> 1535.0
have to they do this soft r

1532.34 --> 1535.0
r r

1535.82 --> 1540.34
r r r

1537.34 --> 1540.34
uh

1541.0 --> 1547.58
yeah R is very

1543.799 --> 1549.62
it's almost like you cut your tongue off

1547.58 --> 1552.4399999999998
you can't do the r

1549.62 --> 1557.62
you can't do it properly

1552.44 --> 1557.6200000000001
you cannot speak proper or

1564.86 --> 1569.059
yeah so

1567.26 --> 1573.02
think of the

1569.059 --> 1576.039
the city there's a city it's more huge

1573.02 --> 1580.12
people know it as dead

1576.039 --> 1584.539
no it's Den ha right but there's another

1580.12 --> 1587.6589999999999
name for it and a more originally Dutch

1584.539 --> 1592.22
name that is the most unpronounceable

1587.659 --> 1594.3200000000002
city for any non-dodge person ever

1592.22 --> 1596.799
you know how Den Hague was originally

1594.32 --> 1596.799
spelled

1599.9 --> 1606.88
yeah seven

1602.919 --> 1606.88
it's totally crazy

1616.7 --> 1619.96
I hope I've got that right

1620.179 --> 1624.269
foreign

1621.18 --> 1624.269
[Applause]

1625.34 --> 1631.1
yeah

1626.84 --> 1634.52
I have and that's like a separated s

1631.1 --> 1638.6789999999999
g r a v e n

1634.52 --> 1638.679
h a g e

1639.98 --> 1646.6
but I mean that's like

1643.1 --> 1649.3999999999999
s c h type

1646.6 --> 1652.2199999999998
that's just happened is it s and then

1649.4 --> 1654.5
separated from a g but that's not

1652.22 --> 1656.6000000000001
logical that's not how Dutch it it's

1654.5 --> 1660.26
always s-ch

1656.6 --> 1662.059
we never take SG it's always SCH and

1660.26 --> 1664.82
then you get this

1662.059 --> 1668.74
but it automatically happens

1664.82 --> 1668.74
when you with this name

1668.96 --> 1675.26
so you have to s

1671.779 --> 1677.2
this and then the r immediately after

1675.26 --> 1680.6589999999999
and that's something that just people

1677.2 --> 1683.6000000000001
they just hurt their throat if they're

1680.659 --> 1684.74
not Dutch when they do that

1683.6 --> 1688.6399999999999
um

1684.74 --> 1690.34
yes Haven again yeah but scriveningen is

1688.64 --> 1694.1200000000001
still very easy

1690.34 --> 1694.12
Trace half and half

1695.539 --> 1698.2
okay

1698.299 --> 1704.9189999999999
good luck with that anyway I'm chowing

1700.94 --> 1704.919
down on this Illuminati casa

1713.36 --> 1716.49
[Music]

1719.55 --> 1722.75
[Music]

1726.28 --> 1729.45
[Music]

1733.94 --> 1736.539
hmm

1737.38 --> 1743.0590000000002
grinder yeah that's tough more colored

1739.7 --> 1745.5800000000002
I'm very glad I'm not

1743.059 --> 1747.559
I only grind teeth when I'm awake and

1745.58 --> 1749.98
really pissed off or I used to I don't

1747.559 --> 1749.98
do it anymore

1751.1 --> 1756.559
you know why it really happens

1753.679 --> 1759.38
why do your jaws really

1756.559 --> 1761.72
clinch like that

1759.38 --> 1763.279
if you're gonna sleep it's because

1761.72 --> 1765.74
I've noticed

1763.279 --> 1768.98
people that are really active thinkers

1765.74 --> 1770.6
and that have like morality and conflict

1768.98 --> 1773.74
with the world

1770.6 --> 1777.1999999999998
they think a lot it builds up tension

1773.74 --> 1779.96
right there it's actually your eye

1777.2 --> 1782.8400000000001
muscles did you know that

1779.96 --> 1785.0
your eye muscles your brain because your

1782.84 --> 1787.1
brain itself is not is literally not a

1785.0 --> 1789.32
muscle so what happens if you get

1787.1 --> 1792.1999999999998
stressed out is that the nearest muscles

1789.32 --> 1795.1399999999999
basically start to clinch up to

1792.2 --> 1797.6000000000001
literally do the magnetizing effect

1795.14 --> 1800.419
the thing that I can actively do at a

1797.6 --> 1802.52
distance yeah it happens in your body so

1800.419 --> 1804.14
your jaw is one of the most powerful

1802.52 --> 1806.179
muscles

1804.14 --> 1809.5
you got

1806.179 --> 1812.419
what you're stressed out you are gonna

1809.5 --> 1814.34
probably right earn when you get angry

1812.419 --> 1818.3600000000001
it's stress

1814.34 --> 1821.059
because tension takes that away and I

1818.36 --> 1822.9799999999998
notice that every time I go to sleep I

1821.059 --> 1824.12
have a lot of tension here right behind

1822.98 --> 1827.3600000000001
my eyes

1824.12 --> 1831.32
from the eye muscles and then I have a

1827.36 --> 1832.58
tendency to earn glue that like lock it

1831.32 --> 1835.039
up tight

1832.58 --> 1837.6789999999999
so keep it tense not super tense but

1835.039 --> 1840.02
tense enough to attract tension because

1837.679 --> 1842.539
it attracts tension away

1840.02 --> 1846.58
the back of my eye muscles

1842.539 --> 1846.58
that's usually where it comes from

1846.799 --> 1850.8799999999999
right

1847.94 --> 1855.0800000000002
now if you could

1850.88 --> 1858.14
in any way do magnetization then you can

1855.08 --> 1859.0
literally prevent jaw clenching like

1858.14 --> 1863.48
that

1859.0 --> 1864.52
by magnetizing the back of your eyes by

1863.48 --> 1867.559
just

1864.52 --> 1870.1399999999999
absorbing it right out of it's not out

1867.559 --> 1872.36
of your skull it's from behind your eyes

1870.14 --> 1875.3600000000001
where there's muscles

1872.36 --> 1877.34
dude I this literally hurt me like doing

1875.36 --> 1880.059
it just as it that much like it

1877.34 --> 1880.059
immediately

1881.36 --> 1887.24
it's like ow

1884.12 --> 1889.58
so it's immediately drawing it up

1887.24 --> 1891.38
and the more it's drawn out of there the

1889.58 --> 1893.12
more relaxed you'll feel even almost

1891.38 --> 1895.5800000000002
kind of Daisy

1893.12 --> 1900.279
and you'll definitely not have clinching

1895.58 --> 1900.279
Jaws so that might be a tip

1903.08 --> 1905.5
right

1905.659 --> 1912.159
but this is how it works with me and I

1908.659 --> 1912.159
have that issue a lot

1912.799 --> 1918.08
but I don't grind

1915.26 --> 1920.84
and I always try to let go of my because

1918.08 --> 1923.48
also I I can't afford to have my jaw

1920.84 --> 1926.779
lock like that because I got so many

1923.48 --> 1929.059
issues with my teeth

1926.779 --> 1932.779
I it's dangerous

1929.059 --> 1937.36
like I could literally like ruin

1932.779 --> 1937.36
my teeth further if I do that

1937.76 --> 1943.1
not that there's any acute danger but if

1939.919 --> 1945.76
I really crush it then there is and I

1943.1 --> 1950.26
don't want to damage my teeth anymore so

1945.76 --> 1950.26
I take great care to prevent that

1957.86 --> 1963.02
right yeah and smoking doesn't matter at

1960.2 --> 1966.0800000000002
all by the way for that

1963.02 --> 1968.12
because I use proper filters

1966.08 --> 1971.1789999999999
these ones

1968.12 --> 1974.059
and because of that and I am not a chain

1971.179 --> 1975.44
smoker like that but I do smoke plenty

1974.059 --> 1978.44
of joints

1975.44 --> 1982.64
but because that filter system

1978.44 --> 1985.52
yeah teeth are just fine right they look

1982.64 --> 1989.72
does that look all blackened up

1985.52 --> 1991.82
nope yeah in between maybe a little

1989.72 --> 1995.8990000000001
or that could be an Illuminati called

1991.82 --> 1998.899
song it's not perfect white I know but I

1995.899 --> 2004.2399999999998
mean my teeth has been a lot worse when

1998.899 --> 2006.5189999999998
I still drank black tea and coffee

2004.24 --> 2008.919
because when you combine that with

2006.519 --> 2010.96
smoking that's when [ __ ] starts to

2008.919 --> 2014.279
plaque to your teeth

2010.96 --> 2014.279
that's what I've noticed

2018.58 --> 2021.539
mouthwash

2021.94 --> 2028.24
I I would know more colored I don't use

2024.82 --> 2032.46
that and I don't believe about the tar

2028.24 --> 2035.799
thing but I do know is that tar

2032.46 --> 2039.6000000000001
specifically is very very well removed

2035.799 --> 2039.6
by these things these fillers

2042.22 --> 2047.82
yeah I'm out by the way so I can't show

2045.399 --> 2047.82
you one

2047.919 --> 2053.7000000000003
I'm gonna get I have to get some new

2050.379 --> 2057.22
ones after the show

2053.7 --> 2060.2999999999997
vaporizing yeah sure vaping but I mean

2057.22 --> 2060.2999999999997
it's not the same though

2065.74 --> 2072.2999999999997
and technically vaping is much more

2068.74 --> 2072.2999999999997
dangerous in the sense that it

2072.94 --> 2078.28
yeah every time I smoke a joint I have

2076.24 --> 2080.2
to roll it

2078.28 --> 2083.3790000000004
with the [ __ ] paypan you could

2080.2 --> 2086.919
literally chain smoke yourself to death

2083.379 --> 2089.44
and not have to lift a finger okay

2086.919 --> 2090.6389999999997
if you have any habit issues with

2089.44 --> 2092.98
smoking

2090.639 --> 2095.859
those things are deadly

2092.98 --> 2099.28
because you can just keep puffing like

2095.859 --> 2102.52
every every five seconds

2099.28 --> 2104.8
until it's all out and dude it can

2102.52 --> 2105.7
seriously [ __ ] you up because of the

2104.8 --> 2111.0600000000004
ease

2105.7 --> 2111.06
because of the ease it's very dangerous

2111.16 --> 2116.3799999999997
yeah and you can get like what is it

2113.619 --> 2119.44
like crisp long something really popcorn

2116.38 --> 2122.8
lungs really [ __ ] up yeah that doesn't

2119.44 --> 2125.619
happen with joints why

2122.8 --> 2128.8
because nobody's crazy enough to like

2125.619 --> 2131.1400000000003
roll a thousand joints and then smoke

2128.8 --> 2133.42
them one at a time after it that doesn't

2131.14 --> 2135.5789999999997
work

2133.42 --> 2137.56
You're Gonna Roll One You're Gonna smoke

2135.579 --> 2142.079
one and then you're gonna wait

2137.56 --> 2142.0789999999997
and then maybe roll a new one

2145.119 --> 2149.92
right the same issue by the way goes

2147.16 --> 2151.5989999999997
with General package cigarettes because

2149.92 --> 2154.48
you can literally get them out light

2151.599 --> 2157.06
them or light the new one with the old

2154.48 --> 2160.7400000000002
one and keep on going that doesn't work

2157.06 --> 2160.74
when you have to roll the thing yourself

2161.46 --> 2166.96
I mean smoking issues are not just

2164.98 --> 2169.48
health or what are you getting in it's

2166.96 --> 2172.96
also the habit of it

2169.48 --> 2175.92
is a very key component

2172.96 --> 2175.92
for smoking

2176.68 --> 2183.22
I really like smoking why

2181.0 --> 2185.98
because

2183.22 --> 2187.839
you go to a special place for smoking

2185.98 --> 2190.78
sometimes outside

2187.839 --> 2193.119
right not everybody smokes so it is like

2190.78 --> 2195.4
the special you have the smokers it's

2193.119 --> 2198.339
like a

2195.4 --> 2200.5
a sort of soft conspiracy like you have

2198.339 --> 2204.4
the smokers you

2200.5 --> 2206.44
you yeah it binds you together it

2204.4 --> 2208.78
it's weird how that works and I always

2206.44 --> 2211.2400000000002
found that very appealing I would always

2208.78 --> 2213.6400000000003
use the smoking room or standing outside

2211.24 --> 2215.9799999999996
with the party and have conversations

2213.64 --> 2218.5
and people would be up for it

2215.98 --> 2221.26
yeah

2218.5 --> 2223.3
I love that

2221.26 --> 2225.099
not no it's not even because of the

2223.3 --> 2227.44
freaking smoking it's because people

2225.099 --> 2231.28
actually want to [ __ ] listen to me

2227.44 --> 2234.599
this is talk about complicated things

2231.28 --> 2234.599
when they're smoking

2234.76 --> 2239.32
and that's why I liked it

2237.28 --> 2241.48
it's not even feel like oh man I can't

2239.32 --> 2244.06
wait to suck off that stupid thing again

2241.48 --> 2245.5
like oh I need to smoke in me no no it's

2244.06 --> 2247.7799999999997
like

2245.5 --> 2250.18
I love it because

2247.78 --> 2252.2200000000003
I can when I just feel casual like oh I

2250.18 --> 2254.2
want to smoke some and then oh somebody

2252.22 --> 2257.14
else comes walking it oh a conversation

2254.2 --> 2259.359
starts oh we we end up like talking an

2257.14 --> 2262.7999999999997
hour straight about spiritual

2259.359 --> 2262.7999999999997
philosophical things

2264.099 --> 2269.619
like Miss half the party because because

2266.619 --> 2270.7000000000003
we were smoking and talking and I loved

2269.619 --> 2273.7000000000003
it

2270.7 --> 2277.839
before I did this stuff on the internet

2273.7 --> 2280.96
that was the place the only real place

2277.839 --> 2284.099
for me where I had elaborate

2280.96 --> 2287.68
mechanical spiritual conversations

2284.099 --> 2289.3
before I did this before I got into Flat

2287.68 --> 2292.48
Earth and on YouTube

2289.3 --> 2295.9
that was the only place

2292.48 --> 2298.3
so you can imagine how [ __ ] I hated

2295.9 --> 2299.92
it that suddenly smoking became

2298.3 --> 2301.3
forbidden everywhere

2299.92 --> 2304.1800000000003
it's like

2301.3 --> 2305.98
I was like yeah I agree don't smoke in

2304.18 --> 2308.14
restaurants at the table that's kind of

2305.98 --> 2310.66
gross

2308.14 --> 2312.94
but then gave us a smoking room

2310.66 --> 2314.92
and then eventually even they banned

2312.94 --> 2317.02
even the smoking rooms and [ __ ] it's

2314.92 --> 2322.02
really [ __ ] up now you're going to go

2317.02 --> 2322.02
to a coffee shop and you can't even

2322.359 --> 2328.839
in some places you can't even actually

2326.02 --> 2332.04
smoke there

2328.839 --> 2332.04
it's [ __ ]

2333.099 --> 2338.4
you can only smoke it if it's pure like

2335.619 --> 2338.4
what the [ __ ] man

2339.64 --> 2345.04
whatever anyway

2342.16 --> 2347.7999999999997
I liked the smoking more because of the

2345.04 --> 2350.52
conversation opportunities than for the

2347.8 --> 2350.52
smoking itself

2351.4 --> 2355.06
because when I wasn't smoking at parties

2353.98 --> 2356.88
and whatever

2355.06 --> 2359.2599999999998
there wouldn't be any conversations

2356.88 --> 2361.48
except with people that were my friends

2359.26 --> 2363.4
I would continually blabber their heads

2361.48 --> 2365.8
off

2363.4 --> 2368.56
safe to say I only had friends that

2365.8 --> 2371.3390000000004
would tolerate that

2368.56 --> 2371.339
uh

2372.28 --> 2374.3390000000004
okay

2381.7 --> 2388.54
anyway I'm not a big fan of vaping

2386.02 --> 2392.64
I mean technological it's pretty

2388.54 --> 2392.64
Advanced but I mean there's just

2399.579 --> 2405.54
yeah you could really ruin yourself just

2402.28 --> 2405.5400000000004
over using them

2435.04 --> 2439.06
okay well Mark college you might have

2437.32 --> 2441.6400000000003
that ability

2439.06 --> 2443.859
to moderate yourself but

2441.64 --> 2446.79
there's plenty of people that don't

2443.859 --> 2450.0
really have that ability all that well

2446.79 --> 2450.0
[Music]

2459.76 --> 2462.6600000000003
ah okay

2466.72 --> 2474.18
oh I must be 18 years or older to for

2470.14 --> 2474.18
that website what the hell

2485.14 --> 2488.3599999999997
[Music]

2489.04 --> 2495.18
okay cool I guess smart caller thanks

2492.46 --> 2495.18
for sharing that

2495.94 --> 2498.94
foreign

2509.14 --> 2513.46
yeah yeah I heard about the new

2511.119 --> 2515.38
marijuana vaping stuff

2513.46 --> 2519.42
but

2515.38 --> 2519.42
that stuff is chemically altered

2521.68 --> 2526.96
I don't think it's even properly known

2524.14 --> 2529.3199999999997
what that actually does to you on the

2526.96 --> 2529.32
long run

2529.359 --> 2533.52
because it's relatively a new invention

2534.44 --> 2537.65
[Music]

2541.119 --> 2545.77
I'm not touching it

2542.56 --> 2545.77
[Music]

2546.579 --> 2549.0600000000004
okay

2562.06 --> 2565.2
it was due

2576.04 --> 2578.579
foreign

2612.22 --> 2618.0989999999997
you don't have to tell me about what

2614.38 --> 2620.7400000000002
happens with a joint i've smoked

2618.099 --> 2623.579
more than I can count

2620.74 --> 2623.5789999999997
in my life

2647.68 --> 2654.54
how is vaporizing new well there is like

2651.46 --> 2656.68
a chemically altered type of cannabis

2654.54 --> 2658.9
vaporizing system

2656.68 --> 2662.5789999999997
out there

2658.9 --> 2662.579
that really gets you high

2663.04 --> 2668.319
I don't know

2665.319 --> 2671.16
what that does to you on the long run I

2668.319 --> 2671.16
don't think they know

2677.8 --> 2681.7000000000003
dry herb paper okay yeah the

2679.96 --> 2684.88
old-fashioned way

2681.7 --> 2688.2599999999998
right well that's fine

2684.88 --> 2688.26
I don't like it though

2688.839 --> 2692.819
because I want tobacco in it

2701.619 --> 2704.859
concentrates are better than me yes

2703.24 --> 2706.72
that's what I was talking about okay I

2704.859 --> 2708.7
didn't know you Vaped the old-fashioned

2706.72 --> 2711.52
way by literally taking a bit of

2708.7 --> 2713.319
cannabis and then vaporizing it okay

2711.52 --> 2715.839
yeah that's

2713.319 --> 2718.2599999999998
very healthy I'm just not really into

2715.839 --> 2718.2599999999998
that

2718.599 --> 2725.94
I don't like it

2721.06 --> 2725.94
I don't like smoking pure I just don't

2728.26 --> 2736.119
a 42 and year old I'm 43.

2732.52 --> 2739.9
and I'm more old-fashioned

2736.119 --> 2741.76
I roll it in a paper and then I light it

2739.9 --> 2745.619
on fire

2741.76 --> 2745.619
that's how old-fashioned I am

2752.02 --> 2758.2599999999998
but yeah my mother got a bit into that

2754.359 --> 2758.2599999999998
type of vaping vaporizing

2758.74 --> 2763.54
I start really vaping it's it is more

2760.839 --> 2767.02
like vaporizing

2763.54 --> 2770.22
but I I just don't like it

2767.02 --> 2770.22
it's not for me

2772.66 --> 2776.3999999999996
it mostly makes me cough

2780.16 --> 2787.02
and every time I smoke cannabis without

2782.619 --> 2787.02
tobacco it just makes me [ __ ]

2788.319 --> 2795.22
and I don't like that I really don't I

2792.339 --> 2798.52
usually end up like oh [ __ ]

2795.22 --> 2802.8999999999996
just angrily agitatedly now not really

2798.52 --> 2805.18
like anxious but just like unhappy and

2802.9 --> 2807.04
disappointed in myself waiting until my

2805.18 --> 2811.54
brain starts working again I don't like

2807.04 --> 2813.88
it I don't like smoking cannabis pure

2811.54 --> 2817.68
I need the tobacco or it makes me

2813.88 --> 2817.6800000000003
[ __ ] it just does that

2824.98 --> 2831.04
don't like bongs either

2828.16 --> 2833.339
unless it well you can mix it in that

2831.04 --> 2833.339
but

2833.56 --> 2839.0789999999997
I just don't like it pure it it's it

2836.319 --> 2840.88
makes me dumb like not on the long run

2839.079 --> 2845.619
but acutely it just literally

2840.88 --> 2848.1400000000003
immediately and it just become so slow

2845.619 --> 2852.78
and lethargic it's [ __ ] lame

2848.14 --> 2852.7799999999997
literally lame I don't like that

2860.74 --> 2866.7
tobacco ruins the taste but it all

2862.96 --> 2866.7
depends on what tobacco you're gonna use

2877.3 --> 2881.92
right Marco but anyway why are we

2879.76 --> 2884.88
talking about cannabis all the time it's

2881.92 --> 2884.88
getting hot babe

2886.18 --> 2888.66
it's getting

2927.7 --> 2930.7
huh

2939.22 --> 2944.14
all right

2941.44 --> 2945.88
okay well enough of that I don't want to

2944.14 --> 2949.56
talk this entire show about freaking

2945.88 --> 2949.56
cannabis I'm serious

2951.099 --> 2955.2400000000002
a bit is is cool

2953.2 --> 2957.0989999999997
figure anything I don't want to talk I

2955.24 --> 2959.6189999999997
don't want to talk about that I don't

2957.099 --> 2963.96
want this show to be about drugs

2959.619 --> 2963.96
okay I really don't

2964.78 --> 2970.48
so I mean enjoy it and all that but

2967.18 --> 2973.66
don't blabber on about it forever a

2970.48 --> 2975.4
little bit is cool and I know I did it

2973.66 --> 2976.18
myself but now I'm realizing I don't

2975.4 --> 2979.1800000000003
wanna

2976.18 --> 2982.18
talk two freaking hours just about

2979.18 --> 2985.18
cannabis I really don't and I don't like

2982.18 --> 2989.22
people that want to talk about cannabis

2985.18 --> 2989.22
all the time I don't like them

2989.84 --> 2995.76
[Music]

2991.079 --> 2995.76
use it and leave it

2997.72 --> 2999.839
um

3006.9 --> 3010.09
I like the the language subject much

3009.42 --> 3014.909
more

3010.09 --> 3014.909
[Music]

3047.54 --> 3054.18
that video we made has 246 views

3052.079 --> 3057.0
yeah but that's because you put it in

3054.18 --> 3059.3999999999996
the uh in the shorts

3057.0 --> 3062.48
people are gonna flick through it and it

3059.4 --> 3062.48
was a pretty funny video

3064.079 --> 3066.8590000000004
so that's you

3069.48 --> 3072.44
I'll post it

3077.339 --> 3080.7
yeah unless we made a little comedy

3079.38 --> 3083.54
sketch

3080.7 --> 3083.54
pretty funny

3097.3 --> 3100.4190000000003
[Music]

3114.599 --> 3121.04
Heist view of your video yeah

3117.119 --> 3121.04
but I mean it's a funny little skip

3125.04 --> 3128.359
it's gonna attract some attention

3129.059 --> 3137.48
oh like [ __ ] what oh what the hell

3727.799 --> 3733.319
with your [ __ ] climate cultist

3730.14 --> 3737.299
[ __ ] yeah provable cults

3733.319 --> 3741.54
based on provable models that are broken

3737.299 --> 3744.599
based off a universal model of reality

3741.54 --> 3747.119
called a ball Earth which has been

3744.599 --> 3750.6600000000003
utterly disproven everything about

3747.119 --> 3753.839
climate change cultism is all a lie it

3750.66 --> 3756.68
is the most purest of lies ever

3753.839 --> 3756.68
concocted

3756.78 --> 3765.3590000000004
and they all point one by one at all the

3761.4 --> 3768.42
elements that we critically need

3765.359 --> 3771.18
for life to exist

3768.42 --> 3774.48
all one by one they are named as

3771.18 --> 3776.94
pollutants yes CO2

3774.48 --> 3780.859
nitrogen

3776.94 --> 3780.859
I mean what's next oxygen

3781.14 --> 3787.859
I'm not the first one to say that I mean

3784.14 --> 3789.9
they need to get the [ __ ] out I want to

3787.859 --> 3792.42
banish these people

3789.9 --> 3794.46
I want them to be dumped on an island

3792.42 --> 3797.94
and you [ __ ] figure out how to live

3794.46 --> 3800.16
shut your [ __ ] mouth yeah it's all

3797.94 --> 3804.14
[ __ ] nothing happens what you say

3800.16 --> 3804.14
you need to get the [ __ ] out of here

3804.24 --> 3809.64
you need to get the [ __ ] out of

3807.059 --> 3813.0
civilized regions

3809.64 --> 3814.859
go sit on a [ __ ] Island

3813.0 --> 3819.26
chanting about your climate change

3814.859 --> 3819.2599999999998
[ __ ] don't do it here

3826.2 --> 3828.87
oh

3827.94 --> 3832.44
ah

3828.87 --> 3832.44
[Music]

3844.68 --> 3851.359
but I mean in all fairness I think that

3847.98 --> 3854.819
I think that we should like universally

3851.359 --> 3856.74
like the Western World all of it I think

3854.819 --> 3858.72
we should break

3856.74 --> 3862.2
with this notion

3858.72 --> 3864.0589999999997
that people that are that evil and they

3862.2 --> 3866.22
are evil it doesn't matter if they're

3864.059 --> 3868.44
ignorant they are acting evil they are

3866.22 --> 3870.66
creating evil they are perpetuating evil

3868.44 --> 3873.66
and they're profiting of evil

3870.66 --> 3876.66
that those people should be

3873.66 --> 3878.46
still consider to be part of society

3876.66 --> 3883.859
when they're not

3878.46 --> 3886.859
those people need to be isolated

3883.859 --> 3889.5
and then actually execute it I think

3886.859 --> 3891.9
yeah and I think that even [ __ ] Arab

3889.5 --> 3895.74
countries with their Islam I have

3891.9 --> 3898.2000000000003
actually failed I think they've failed I

3895.74 --> 3900.8999999999996
think that they were weak

3898.2 --> 3903.72
indeed because of their weakness

3900.9 --> 3905.52
all these dredges pieces of [ __ ] which

3903.72 --> 3909.24
should have been people that should have

3905.52 --> 3911.7599999999998
been exterminated you see

3909.24 --> 3914.5789999999997
they should have been exterminated and

3911.76 --> 3916.6800000000003
dumped into Mass Graves

3914.579 --> 3920.099
where they would have fulfilled a better

3916.68 --> 3925.0789999999997
function of fertilizing the ground for

3920.099 --> 3927.0
people that actually deserve to have

3925.079 --> 3929.88
fruits

3927.0 --> 3930.9
because these people are scum of the

3929.88 --> 3933.9
Earth

3930.9 --> 3936.54
and yeah I'm not thanking

3933.9 --> 3937.859
the Islamic countries for leaving them

3936.54 --> 3940.5
alive

3937.859 --> 3942.0
when people that are that were bad that

3940.5 --> 3944.7
garbage

3942.0 --> 3948.78
should have been executed but they

3944.7 --> 3950.22
didn't which sounds like weakness to me

3948.78 --> 3953.2200000000003
sounds like

3950.22 --> 3956.16
Islam is slipping a little too getting a

3953.22 --> 3958.14
little more gamma and like oh you you

3956.16 --> 3960.24
imported them yeah yeah well you left

3958.14 --> 3962.94
them alive

3960.24 --> 3966.839

yeah even in your country they did that

4099.819 --> 4106.400000000001

but they are the ones that gonna get it

4613.82 --> 4620.199
they're just there to die and make them

4616.76 --> 4620.1990000000005
feel really [ __ ] up

4621.199 --> 4625.599999999999
because they thought that they were

4623.84 --> 4629.06
smart

4625.6 --> 4631.34
working with the globalists and letting

4629.06 --> 4634.04
all this [ __ ] happen they go oh they're

4631.34 --> 4636.38
just destroyed themselves oh yeah oh

4634.04 --> 4638.12
we're so smart yeah yeah guess who's

4636.38 --> 4640.78
gonna pay the [ __ ] price for that

4638.12 --> 4640.78
[ __ ]

4641.96 --> 4648.94
yeah you think after this [ __ ]

4644.86 --> 4648.94
Islamic scumbag Revolution

4648.98 --> 4655.699
from this trash that you let the

4652.58 --> 4658.34
globalist export to our countries

4655.699 --> 4660.62
instead of having executed them as would

4658.34 --> 4663.56
have been proper

4660.62 --> 4667.159
for their General criminal insane

4663.56 --> 4669.8
behavior that are unrepenting with

4667.159 --> 4671.719
as they kept assaulting everybody even

4669.8 --> 4675.14
in your own country

4671.719 --> 4676.94
yeah you should have executed them

4675.14 --> 4678.320000000001
would have been plenty of grounds to do

4676.94 --> 4681.5199999999995
that

4678.32 --> 4686.299999999999
in your own [ __ ] law yeah

4681.52 --> 4688.1
but you didn't you instead chose to use

4686.3 --> 4693.04
them against the West

4688.1 --> 4693.04
and you will pay for that very dearly

4700.64 --> 4705.4400000000005
it would have been much better that when

4703.46 --> 4708.62
these people were supposedly moving away

4705.44 --> 4711.0199999999995
that they just

4708.62 --> 4712.34
gotten helicopters and just mowed them

4711.02 --> 4714.26
all down

4712.34 --> 4716.9800000000005
before they could exit the country that

4714.26 --> 4716.9800000000005
would have been better

4718.1 --> 4722.0
yeah

4720.08 --> 4724.1
I mean I wouldn't

4722.0 --> 4726.32
can you imagine that we have a bunch of

4724.1 --> 4729.08
[ __ ] up crazy people that really

4726.32 --> 4731.36
originate from this country kind of like

4729.08 --> 4733.76
me but like actually physically

4731.36 --> 4735.86
aggressive and all that all like the

4733.76 --> 4738.14
worst

4735.86 --> 4740.239
you're gonna dump that on another

4738.14 --> 4744.62
country

4740.239 --> 4748.699
that makes you responsible you [ __ ] with

4744.62 --> 4752.12
you take care of your own

4748.699 --> 4754.94
you don't make another country

4752.12 --> 4757.4
you don't make it their problem

4754.94 --> 4760.46
you don't dump your pieces of [ __ ] on

4757.4 --> 4762.5599999999995
another country you take care of them

4760.46 --> 4765.26
they're your problem

4762.56 --> 4767.780000000001
and you will be traced back as being

4765.26 --> 4771.38
responsible for that by people

4767.78 --> 4777.259999999999
whether that's legal or whatever doesn't

4771.38 --> 4780.32
matter it's natural law that's how it is

4777.26 --> 4782.42
you dump your trash on us you will pay

4780.32 --> 4786.44
the price

4782.42 --> 4789.04
nobody gets to dump their trash for free

4786.44 --> 4789.04
you understand

4801.14 --> 4806.0
I don't care what you don't understand

4803.0 --> 4809.36
logical conclusion

4806.0 --> 4813.92
this is not about being comprehensible

4809.36 --> 4817.54
for you I'm not addressing you

4813.92 --> 4817.54
I'm talking globally

4839.42 --> 4843.9800000000005
yeah I'm not even talking about England

4841.28 --> 4845.0599999999995
I mean that [ __ ] is such a [ __ ]

4843.98 --> 4849.259999999999
mess

4845.06 --> 4851.120000000001
it's unbelievable I'm just talking about

4849.26 --> 4853.34
[ __ ] that's going down in France and

4851.12 --> 4856.76
they have a long history the like those

4853.34 --> 4859.900000000001
blacks and France

4856.76 --> 4859.900000000001
but I mean

4860.3 --> 4865.6990000000005
it's so [ __ ] dumb

4862.82 --> 4868.28
I mean what the [ __ ] do you think is

4865.699 --> 4871.219
gonna happen after that you [ __ ]

4868.28 --> 4874.34
trash scumbag that should have your

4871.219 --> 4877.58
skulls crushed on the sidewalk

4874.34 --> 4880.4800000000005
yeah each and every one of you you

4877.58 --> 4883.64
[ __ ] scumbag with your illegally

4880.48 --> 4885.58
imported machine guns like how the [ __ ]

4883.64 --> 4888.9800000000005
did that even happen

4885.58 --> 4892.34
why aren't there like snipers on the

4888.98 --> 4895.099999999999
roof just [ __ ] killing them all

4892.34 --> 4897.52
why aren't you taking them down you

4895.1 --> 4897.52
[ __ ]

4900.62 --> 4906.199
all right

4902.199 --> 4907.82
these stupid scumbags doing all that

4906.199 --> 4910.099999999999
like

4907.82 --> 4912.44
do they realize do they even they

4910.1 --> 4914.54
probably hate everybody they probably

4912.44 --> 4917.0599999999995
hate the people in their own country

4914.54 --> 4919.5199999999995
they probably hate Islam and they hate

4917.06 --> 4921.1990000000005
France

4919.52 --> 4923.719
probably both

4921.199 --> 4924.799999999999
seriously I mean they will chat AL Akbar

4923.719 --> 4928.4
and all that

4924.8 --> 4930.08
but I mean they hate the people that

4928.4 --> 4932.0
rule their country their original

4930.08 --> 4935.3
country

4932.0 --> 4936.62
because those people rejected them

4935.3 --> 4939.5
yeah

4936.62 --> 4941.3
these [ __ ] in France roaming around and

4939.5 --> 4944.54
their kids

4941.3 --> 4947.7390000000005
they are outlaws

4944.54 --> 4947.739
in Arab countries

4948.199 --> 4953.178999999999
right

4949.52 --> 4955.88
so technically they don't even care if

4953.179 --> 4959.06
after they [ __ ] France starts another

4955.88 --> 4961.64
war with their home country

4959.06 --> 4964.88
they don't care they want that you know

4961.64 --> 4967.64
why because they hate their original

4964.88 --> 4971.179
Nation they hate the rulers of their

4967.64 --> 4974.42
original nation and they hate

4971.179 --> 4978.4400000000005
all the people that surround them that

4974.42 --> 4980.9
guessed them in their Nation they hate

4978.44 --> 4983.659
it all they want it all to burn and

4980.9 --> 4986.599999999999
though thus they should just be

4983.659 --> 4989.96
Mass executed

4986.6 --> 4992.84
as terrorists which they are they are

4989.96 --> 4996.9800000000005
terrorists they're just indiscriminate

4992.84 --> 5000.6990000000005
murderers plunderers vandalizers

4996.98 --> 5000.699
open racists

5001.719 --> 5010.38
violator and and murderer of children

5006.04 --> 5010.38
they do that they don't give a [ __ ]

5011.44 --> 5019.239
they should all be promptly executed

5015.82 --> 5022.0599999999995
yeah not jilled executed

5019.239 --> 5025.0599999999995
and literally go in with

5022.06 --> 5027.280000000001
I don't know machine guns flamethrowers

5025.06 --> 5030.219
go into these neighborhoods where you

5027.28 --> 5032.08
can go and literally light the entire

5030.219 --> 5035.8
place up

5032.08 --> 5038.26
corner it off and burn it all just burn

5035.8 --> 5040.3
it all down

5038.26 --> 5041.320000000001
and shoot anything that comes running

5040.3 --> 5044.26
out

5041.32 --> 5047.139999999999
just [ __ ] torch the entire [ __ ]

5044.26 --> 5050.679
place leave nothing left

5047.14 --> 5051.9400000000005
nothing all of it die all of it

5050.679 --> 5055.38
yeah

5051.94 --> 5055.379999999999
that's what they should do

5056.92 --> 5062.02
because these people are all pirate

5059.98 --> 5064.78
scumbag

5062.02 --> 5066.9400000000005
just criminals

5064.78 --> 5068.92
and they're not repenting and they use

5066.94 --> 5072.28
their own children

5068.92 --> 5075.46
they'd like it's it's the worst possible

5072.28 --> 5079.48
the only logical course of action is

5075.46 --> 5079.4800000000005
full on extermination

5082.3 --> 5087.0
or die yeah or die

5087.76 --> 5092.92
you exterminate them or you get

5090.58 --> 5094.9
exterminated you choose

5092.92 --> 5097.06
because that's what they will do they

5094.9 --> 5099.639999999999
will do that because they don't give a

5097.06 --> 5102.159000000001
[ __ ] about anything they're just there

5099.64 --> 5103.9800000000005
to destroy everything because they've

5102.159 --> 5107.08
been rejected everywhere

5103.98 --> 5109.718999999999
except by these [ __ ] globalists that

5107.08 --> 5112.239
know that they'll never heal that

5109.719 --> 5115.54
they'll never adapt and they'll just try

5112.239 --> 5117.58
to assault and replace

5115.54 --> 5119.739
the local population that's the only

5117.58 --> 5121.84
thing that they want to do they just

5119.739 --> 5123.04
want to replace everybody but they're

5121.84 --> 5124.179
not going to work they're not gonna

5123.04 --> 5128.26
build

5124.179 --> 5130.54
yeah those people you know what they do

5128.26 --> 5132.659000000001
they kill everybody and then leave a

5130.54 --> 5137.08
couple of people alive

5132.659 --> 5139.78
to slave labor under threat of torture

5137.08 --> 5143.26
and death for them yeah they will never

5139.78 --> 5147.099999999999
work they will enslave you and your

5143.26 --> 5149.320000000001
women French yeah and your children

5147.1 --> 5151.659000000001
to do everything for you and it will

5149.32 --> 5154.0599999999995
barely hold up I mean it's not even

5151.659 --> 5156.159
gonna be like France is Never Gonna

5154.06 --> 5158.56
return to back to normal if they

5156.159 --> 5160.42
actually overrun everything it's never

5158.56 --> 5163.900000000001
going to turn back to normal you will be

5160.42 --> 5167.7390000000005
slaves in Chains and cages

5163.9 --> 5169.839999999999
in a [ __ ] that they will roll

5167.739 --> 5174.36
over you

5169.84 --> 5174.360000000001
unless you exterminate them

5174.4 --> 5180.339999999999
and I take your [ __ ] prime minister

5176.92 --> 5183.76
with it I mean that guy needs to burn

5180.34 --> 5185.860000000001
and that whole [ __ ] following of his

5183.76 --> 5188.02
you should probably just put them on

5185.86 --> 5191.08
stakes and burn them

5188.02 --> 5193.179
because they absolutely deserve it they

5191.08 --> 5196.54
know everything that was gonna happen

5193.179 --> 5198.46
all of this happening right now is part

5196.54 --> 5201.28
of their playbook and you're not even

5198.46 --> 5204.1
half the [ __ ] way of that Playbook

5201.28 --> 5205.9
yeah you're not even halfway through the

5204.1 --> 5208.179
[ __ ] Playbook

5205.9 --> 5211.239
yeah

5208.179 --> 5213.9400000000005
so when are you gonna do something

5211.239 --> 5216.759999999999
French when are you gonna let this

5213.94 --> 5219.4
stupid [ __ ] liberal veneer Go and

5216.76 --> 5221.88
show who the real French were yeah

5219.4 --> 5225.04
the original French

5221.88 --> 5227.139
continually beseech with war and [ __ ]

5225.04 --> 5230.139
and doing War themselves for their

5227.139 --> 5233.679
freaky [ __ ] up Kings yeah

5230.139 --> 5236.26
you actually did [ __ ]

5233.679 --> 5238.36
and you didn't give a [ __ ]

5236.26 --> 5240.46
and you just did these things it's like

5238.36 --> 5242.5599999999995
oh they're against us okay then we kill

5240.46 --> 5244.659
them all tonight and you did that you

5242.56 --> 5247.54
just [ __ ] killed them all you did it

5244.659 --> 5250.42
right there right then and nobody would

5247.54 --> 5251.8
give a [ __ ] about it afterwards because

5250.42 --> 5254.26
you're French

5251.8 --> 5255.58
yeah that's who you were

5254.26 --> 5259.659000000001
well

5255.58 --> 5264.46
you don't seem to be showing that type

5259.659 --> 5267.28
of culture anymore so get ready to die

5264.46 --> 5270.9
yeah you understand you let it go and

5267.28 --> 5274.3
now you're gonna die every one of them

5270.9 --> 5276.96
torturously torturous death and

5274.3 --> 5276.96
humiliation

5277.48 --> 5285.459999999999
yeah unless you can muster finding that

5281.5 --> 5288.639
old French Spirit back that did not give

5285.46 --> 5291.159
a [ __ ] and just did what needed to be

5288.639 --> 5292.78
done even if you died in the process

5291.159 --> 5295.659
yeah

5292.78 --> 5297.699
the old French if they knew like oh our

5295.659 --> 5299.32
generals are secretly working together

5297.699 --> 5301.239
with the king of the opponent and

5299.32 --> 5303.159
they're like maneuver it would [ __ ]

5301.239 --> 5305.459999999999
walk off to them and just [ __ ] shoot

5303.159 --> 5305.46
them

5311.26 --> 5316.0
yeah they would they would literally

5313.659 --> 5317.5
risk their own lives they probably got

5316.0 --> 5319.48
shot but they would just do it they

5317.5 --> 5322.06
would just walk up and [ __ ] kill them

5319.48 --> 5324.9
kill the [ __ ] General because they

5322.06 --> 5324.900000000001
are a traitor

5326.92 --> 5331.78
Bang and they'd get it then they get it

5330.219 --> 5333.58
to jail they probably got executed but

5331.78 --> 5336.82
they'd still [ __ ] do it because why

5333.58 --> 5339.159
because they didn't give a [ __ ] and they

5336.82 --> 5341.259999999999
knew that they had to do that or that

5339.159 --> 5343.259999999999
France would be dead

5341.26 --> 5347.02
they were that

5343.26 --> 5350.26
patriotic yeah they would literally just

5347.02 --> 5352.4800000000005
get themselves killed

5350.26 --> 5355.2390000000005
doing something that risky because they

5352.48 --> 5358.54
knew if they didn't they didn't die for

5355.239 --> 5361.659
that specific thing Against All Odds

5358.54 --> 5363.94
that France would be dead and they

5361.659 --> 5366.54
actually cared enough to do something

5363.94 --> 5366.54
about it

5369.28 --> 5373.48
okay

5371.32 --> 5376.42
so think about it French

5373.48 --> 5378.759999999999
how long are you gonna play this stupid

5376.42 --> 5381.58
little oh we're so French liberal

5378.76 --> 5382.780000000001
civilized game or when are you gonna

5381.58 --> 5384.639
show

5382.78 --> 5387.88
your roots

5384.639 --> 5392.02
what actually made France strong and

5387.88 --> 5395.7390000000005
revered and feared

5392.02 --> 5398.26
yeah you take care of your own you take

5395.739 --> 5401.5
care of your corruption

5398.26 --> 5405.34
and you don't get a [ __ ] what the world

5401.5 --> 5406.719
says yeah that's the French way now go

5405.34 --> 5409.9800000000005
and do it

5406.719 --> 5409.9800000000005
take care of business

5410.26 --> 5415.139
show the world how you do it

5416.55 --> 5420.129
[Music]

5423.639 --> 5426.54
or burn

5426.699 --> 5433.5599999999995
let it all burn yes yeah you get a

5429.76 --> 5433.56
choice show what you got or burn

5433.6 --> 5439.3
no more [ __ ] no more oh we can fix

5436.719 --> 5442.78
it oh [ __ ] you fix it

5439.3 --> 5445.56
yeah you can't fix this

5442.78 --> 5449.88
you can only take care of it

5445.56 --> 5449.88
now go and do it or die

5450.58 --> 5455.139
so that's my message to France and

5453.46 --> 5457.4800000000005
Arabia

5455.139 --> 5460.2390000000005
both of you

5457.48 --> 5463.36
yeah you're you're literally

5460.239 --> 5465.58
if you don't fix this if you don't

5463.36 --> 5468.46
take care of this

5465.58 --> 5471.94
you're gonna have like a

5468.46 --> 5473.02
a century type War that's just never

5471.94 --> 5475.12
gonna end

5473.02 --> 5477.820000000001
Team France

5475.12 --> 5481.599999999999
and these [ __ ] Arabian and African

5477.82 --> 5483.34
countries like it will never end okay

5481.6 --> 5485.92
and that's what the design that's what

5483.34 --> 5489.78
the globalist wants they want the French

5485.92 --> 5489.78
to be in a Perpetual War

5493.719 --> 5497.9800000000005
and the more you're gonna let this wound

5496.0 --> 5500.26
sit there and let them burn down

5497.98 --> 5502.419999999999
neighborhoods and let them just assault

5500.26 --> 5505.679
police officers

5502.42 --> 5509.679
the more absolutely inevitable it is

5505.679 --> 5513.3
that you will be just sent into Wars of

5509.679 --> 5513.3
Slaughter for no damn reason

5513.82 --> 5517.96
just back and forth back and forth and

5515.98 --> 5520.54
you'll never get out of it and they'll

5517.96 --> 5521.7390000000005
never get those [ __ ] up people away

5520.54 --> 5524.56
from there

5521.739 --> 5526.718999999999
they will never make them go they will

5524.56 --> 5528.52
never take care of them yeah these this

5526.719 --> 5531.159
government you have these globalists

5528.52 --> 5534.580000000001
they will never make them stop they will

5531.159 --> 5536.86
let these Arab it's not even Arab these

5534.58 --> 5539.08
scumbags these supposed islamics

5536.86 --> 5542.5
comebacks overrun your entire country

5539.08 --> 5544.6
they won't stop them yeah

5542.5 --> 5547.44
I mean these police officers they can't

5544.6 --> 5547.4400000000005
even do anything

5548.199 --> 5555.159
I mean they're not even allowed to shoot

5551.08 --> 5558.78
back with live weapons like that

5555.159 --> 5558.78
in this situation like dude

5559.12 --> 5564.34
as far as I'm concerned if you're there

5561.58 --> 5566.38
as a police and somebody throws a rock

5564.34 --> 5569.860000000001
at you or starts shooting heavy

5566.38 --> 5573.06
fireworks at you you take a gun and you

5569.86 --> 5575.86
[ __ ] shoot them

5573.06 --> 5581.4400000000005
that's normal

5575.86 --> 5584.679
if somebody overtly assaults you

5581.44 --> 5588.0599999999995
you shoot them

5584.679 --> 5588.06
that's normal

5590.8 --> 5596.56
I think that these police Chiefs that

5593.62 --> 5598.12
are in place there in France keeping it

5596.56 --> 5600.820000000001
the way they are I think that they're

5598.12 --> 5602.679
Traders and they should be executed I

5600.82 --> 5605.199
think that the police themselves should

5602.679 --> 5609.4
actually do the revolution I mean that's

5605.199 --> 5611.678999999999
where all the badasses gather anyway

5609.4 --> 5613.54
but instead of just Gathering there to

5611.679 --> 5615.04
get slaughtered and not being able to do

5613.54 --> 5617.62
anything about I think that the police

5615.04 --> 5619.6
themselves should have a revolution they

5617.62 --> 5621.82
should go into Revolution

5619.6 --> 5625.54
literally take out their own police

5621.82 --> 5628.36
Chiefs change the rules

5625.54 --> 5631.8
arrest macron like with there should

5628.36 --> 5634.719
probably be like a police force coup

5631.8 --> 5636.28
arrest macron arrest those people in

5634.719 --> 5641.08
politics

5636.28 --> 5644.32
and then the real war starts then

5641.08 --> 5647.82
actually with heavy Weaponry go after

5644.32 --> 5647.82
these [ __ ] Invaders

5648.1 --> 5652.659000000001
right

5650.38 --> 5654.34
and then there's two

5652.659 --> 5658.0599999999995
things you could do you could either

5654.34 --> 5659.5
build an actual serious wall around the

5658.06 --> 5662.139
entire region

5659.5 --> 5663.82
like really build it in

5662.139 --> 5665.86
that is not really going to fix it

5663.82 --> 5668.139
really on the long run it will it will

5665.86 --> 5671.5
break again they will break out again

5668.139 --> 5674.139
or you could just say like okay yeah

5671.5 --> 5676.96
we're going to

5674.139 --> 5679.179
literally turn off all the power

5676.96 --> 5681.52
all the internet Towers we're gonna turn

5679.179 --> 5684.159
it all off for a while

5681.52 --> 5687.639
We Gather the troops and we go in there

5684.159 --> 5690.28
with the flame throwers and the miniguns

5687.639 --> 5693.58
and the sniper rifles and we [ __ ]

5690.28 --> 5695.62
kill every single one of them

5693.58 --> 5697.54
and there's not going to be any film

5695.62 --> 5700.3
footage of it

5697.54 --> 5703.12
and we just [ __ ] kill them all

5700.3 --> 5704.9800000000005
and then literally clean them out bold

5703.12 --> 5706.78
those all the corpses and [ __ ] away

5704.98 --> 5709.48
quickly

5706.78 --> 5711.28
before yeah before oh we got power

5709.48 --> 5715.419999999999
restored again yeah and then it's like

5711.28 --> 5718.42
oh oh look oh yeah they've all fled

5715.42 --> 5720.219
yeah do that just [ __ ] do it dude

5718.42 --> 5722.4400000000005
just do it

5720.219 --> 5725.5
I mean what the [ __ ] is anybody gonna do

5722.44 --> 5729.299999999999
about it anyway you're [ __ ] friends

5725.5 --> 5729.3
you're the biggest country in Europe

5730.719 --> 5737.38
just [ __ ] do it everybody will love

5734.38 --> 5740.38
you for it everybody wants this

5737.38 --> 5740.38
everybody

5751.9 --> 5756.58
this is Bleak yeah it is that's what

5754.42 --> 5759.4800000000005
needs to be done though retroville hello

5756.58 --> 5759.48
good to see you

5761.08 --> 5763.739
ah

5768.76 --> 5771.4800000000005
foreign

5785.02 --> 5790.659000000001
and and the best thing Beyond it would

5788.139 --> 5792.639
be besides France is that well if

5790.659 --> 5794.86
they're gonna actually finally take care

5792.639 --> 5797.92
of them and and they die

5794.86 --> 5800.0199999999995
not just oh one killed kid got killed

5797.92 --> 5801.76
yeah there's gonna be a revolution then

5800.02 --> 5804.040000000001
and everywhere else in Europe and their

5801.76 --> 5806.92
goal gonna start trashing and then you

5804.04 --> 5809.44
other countries will all face the same

5806.92 --> 5811.96
[ __ ] so what are you gonna do you're

5809.44 --> 5814.78
just gonna let him burn it down like a

5811.96 --> 5817.2390000000005
bunch of [ __ ] are you gonna actually

5814.78 --> 5820.199
take care of them like oh we're gonna

5817.239 --> 5820.199
revolutionize yeah

5821.08 --> 5828.699
yeah that should be the response

5825.4 --> 5831.699
[ __ ] shoot them all

5828.699 --> 5834.178999999999
what [ __ ] Revolution yeah this is not

your [ __ ] country you sick scumbags

you deserve to die

5839.98 --> 5844.239
yeah

5841.54 --> 5846.82
and your [ __ ] origin countries those

5844.239 --> 5849.58
governments

5846.82 --> 5853.299999999999
they should probably pay

5849.58 --> 5856.48
for not actually doing that for letting

5853.3 --> 5860.5
you leaving you alive and letting these

5856.48 --> 5862.659
globalist scumbag satanists import you

5860.5 --> 5865.84
for your convenience yeah you're gonna

5862.659 --> 5868.599999999999
have to pay a price for that

5865.84 --> 5870.78
for just letting that happen you

5868.6 --> 5870.780000000001
understand

5876.15 --> 5879.82
[Music]

5884.08 --> 5886.5
oh

5889.6 --> 5896.280000000001
so pick up your machine guns and shoot

5893.199 --> 5896.28
the Invaders

5897.82 --> 5902.5599999999995
or pick up their [ __ ] machine guns

5900.82 --> 5904.48
and shoot them

5902.56 --> 5905.8
I mean in Western Country you're

5904.48 --> 5908.259999999999
probably not going to have a gun well

5905.8 --> 5911.46
they have machine guns

5908.26 --> 5911.46
so take care of them

5911.739 --> 5916.718999999999
right or take an improvised explosive

5914.139 --> 5918.88
just blow them up and then you pick

5916.719 --> 5921.84
their guns up and then now look you got

5918.88 --> 5921.84
some machine guns

5922.659 --> 5928.659
and probably shoot a few with that

5925.659 --> 5930.5199999999995
yeah fight back

5928.659 --> 5933.839999999999
it's War

5930.52 --> 5933.84
it's just War

5939.73 --> 5942.83
[Music]

5946.719 --> 5948.719
m

5953.1 --> 5959.1990000000005
sign up for yeah military's crap I mean

5956.56 --> 5961.780000000001
what the [ __ ] man the military should be

5959.199 --> 5963.28
the ones that are taking care of this

5961.78 --> 5965.5599999999995
but they're in the pockets of the

5963.28 --> 5967.3
globalists they they're not allowed to

5965.56 --> 5969.719
take care of anything that's actually

5967.3 --> 5969.719
good

5970.54 --> 5974.8
they're only there to get in your way

5972.76 --> 5977.08
and to make other to attack other

5974.8 --> 5978.76
countries to force gay policies on them

5977.08 --> 5981.6
that's what your [ __ ] military is

5978.76 --> 5981.6
doing now I mean

5982.9 --> 5987.219
and if they're okay with that then you

5985.36 --> 5992.699
should all fire them you should fire

5987.219 --> 5992.699
your entire military and persecute them

5993.1 --> 5996.3
for treachery

5997.659 --> 6002.219
but I mean there's going to be plenty of

5999.58 --> 6004.38
people that aren't in the military that

6002.219 --> 6006.84
didn't go into the military because of

6004.38 --> 6008.58
the just that well form your own

6006.84 --> 6011.76
military

6008.58 --> 6015.0
I mean you're at War you're at War

6011.76 --> 6018.26
you fight or you die

6015.0 --> 6018.26
form your own military

6031.02 --> 6035.88
yeah that was ridiculous retroville I

6033.659 --> 6039.5599999999995
remember that yeah but that was just

6035.88 --> 6039.56
[ __ ] really [ __ ] stupid

6049.56 --> 6053.76
yeah I I really hope they're not that

6052.08 --> 6057.0599999999995
dumb now

6053.76 --> 6059.1
but I mean maybe they are maybe I yeah I

6057.06 --> 6060.84
don't want to say but maybe it is really

6059.1 --> 6063.3
just the time for the French people to

6060.84 --> 6066.139
die maybe they're just too [ __ ]

6063.3 --> 6066.139
stupid to live

6070.56 --> 6076.860000000001
now whereas there is historical examples

6073.56 --> 6078.84
of it so if that's still the case if

6076.86 --> 6083.239
they're still that stupid then maybe

6078.84 --> 6083.2390000000005
they do deserve to be exterminated

6084.48 --> 6087.138999999999
could be

6089.76 --> 6092.88
right

6090.78 --> 6096.0599999999995
so hey

6092.88 --> 6100.02
maybe maybe there's some French badasses

6096.06 --> 6102.96
there that actually want to prove

6100.02 --> 6105.780000000001
that historical

6102.96 --> 6109.5
view of French people wrong maybe maybe

6105.78 --> 6112.219
you actually want to prove that wrong

6109.5 --> 6112.219
French

6112.679 --> 6118.38
or maybe there's nobody left maybe they

6114.659 --> 6120.299999999999
all got oh yeah medically experimented

6118.38 --> 6122.9400000000005
on to death or

6120.3 --> 6127.4400000000005
they're all in jail

6122.94 --> 6130.0199999999995
because they they said the n-word

6127.44 --> 6132.48
on social media or I don't know I don't

6130.02 --> 6133.280000000001
know even like how extreme that is but I

6132.48 --> 6136.509999999999
mean

6133.28 --> 6136.509999999999
[Music]

6143.94 --> 6150.138999999999
your part Acadian return what does that

6147.96 --> 6150.139
mean

6160.44 --> 6164.4
like they're the only ones yeah but

6162.3 --> 6166.7390000000005
they're not the only ones just start the

6164.4 --> 6169.32
rushing

6166.739 --> 6171.0599999999995
I mean just start doing it and you'll

6169.32 --> 6174.179
start noticing that as soon as you start

6171.06 --> 6176.88
doing it there's gonna be like two and

6174.179 --> 6179.28
then later 10 and then 20 and then 100

6176.88 --> 6182.34
people following you not really

6179.28 --> 6184.8
following you just following along with

6182.34 --> 6187.26
you you're not the only one most people

6184.8 --> 6189.119000000001
are waiting for somebody to finally come

6187.26 --> 6192.06
out of the shadows and make those first

6189.119 --> 6193.5599999999995
steps to officially decide to spearhead

6192.06 --> 6195.54
that movement

6193.56 --> 6197.580000000001
and then they'll come out I am one of

6195.54 --> 6199.76
those people I am waiting for that to

6197.58 --> 6199.76
happen

6200.04 --> 6204.6
here although I mean these farmer

6203.1 --> 6206.58
Defense Force

6204.6 --> 6209.1
seems to be having their own strategy

6206.58 --> 6210.78
and I mean I'm like they're really

6209.1 --> 6212.9400000000005
awesome guys

6210.78 --> 6214.92
and therefore the Dutch Farmers they

6212.94 --> 6217.5199999999995
you'd have to be awesome

6214.92 --> 6217.52
but

6217.56 --> 6222.360000000001
I re I'm still like the Dutch might

6220.38 --> 6224.219
actually sort of have a chance in all

6222.36 --> 6228.92
this

6224.219 --> 6228.92
maybe we can live through this

6230.159 --> 6236.28
without just overt violence like with

6233.88 --> 6238.86
that that line has definitely been

6236.28 --> 6241.86
passed in France I mean they are at War

6238.86 --> 6244.199
now they are in a civil war and they

6241.86 --> 6246.98
better get ready for war or they're all

6244.199 --> 6246.98
gonna die

6247.08 --> 6251.5199999999995
yeah

6248.88 --> 6253.8
take care of your government they are

6251.52 --> 6257.219
traitors

6253.8 --> 6261.659000000001
try to get the military involved to take

6257.219 --> 6264.9
care of this in a more permanent fashion

6261.659 --> 6266.46
or if they want then you're gonna have

6264.9 --> 6268.799999999999
to do it yourselves you're gonna have to

6266.46 --> 6272.159
suit up

6268.8 --> 6275.04
and do it civil war style like some of

6272.159 --> 6277.099999999999
your very far ancestors have

6275.04 --> 6280.26
talking like

6277.1 --> 6283.820000000001
1600s and such dude there's been a lot

6280.26 --> 6283.820000000001
of war in France a lot

6284.34 --> 6289.139
so

6285.6 --> 6291.719
you should have that in you you should

6289.139 --> 6295.619
have that ancestral instinct to guide

6291.719 --> 6297.659
you in doing such things in Civil War

6295.619 --> 6299.639
so

6297.659 --> 6302.4
but you'd have to take that so you have

6299.639 --> 6304.26
to actually engage to get the feel for

6302.4 --> 6308.5199999999995
that Spirit again you have to actually

6304.26 --> 6310.56
do it to remember it to remember how to

6308.52 --> 6312.659000000001
do that that you have that in you that

6310.56 --> 6314.280000000001
you can do that that you can't succeed

6312.659 --> 6316.679
doing that

6314.28 --> 6319.099999999999
you have to remember by taking those

6316.679 --> 6319.1
steps

6320.4 --> 6326.46
you can't wait till the feeling comes to

6323.82 --> 6329.04
you first you have to take the steps

6326.46 --> 6332.46
then the feeling comes then you get what

6329.04 --> 6335.46
you need but you got to do it first

6332.46 --> 6335.46
right

6338.659 --> 6345.259999999999
can the French still rescue the sinking

6341.52 --> 6345.26
ship well through Civil War

6346.639 --> 6353.0
I mean just start shooting back like for

6350.82 --> 6353.0
real

6356.76 --> 6359.360000000001
oh

6361.26 --> 6368.1
treat it like a civil war stop

6364.639 --> 6370.7390000000005
perpetually retreating

6368.1 --> 6373.159000000001
treated like a civil war starts shooting

6370.739 --> 6373.159
back

6373.8 --> 6378.900000000001
that's the only thing that will work

6376.56 --> 6380.34
and work is yeah I mean it is going to

6378.9 --> 6383.638999999999
be a [ __ ] house it's going to be

6380.34 --> 6385.38
slaughterhouse but it already is

6383.639 --> 6387.42
it's the only thing that's going to stop

6385.38 --> 6391.4400000000005
that

6387.42 --> 6396.1990000000005
in the French are still not outnumbered

6391.44 --> 6396.199
but that will eventually change

6397.98 --> 6403.04
I mean the numbers are steadily

6400.5 --> 6403.04
dwindling

6403.08 --> 6407.46
right now

6404.82 --> 6409.44
they're getting killed in their streets

6407.46 --> 6411.4800000000005
in their own streets burning up in their

6409.44 --> 6413.46
own buildings yeah it's happening right

6411.48 --> 6416.718999999999
now it's gonna keep happening

6413.46 --> 6416.719
until you fight back

6416.76 --> 6421.08
and you fight back with lethal Force you

6419.28 --> 6424.44
don't take [ __ ] and you don't give a

6421.08 --> 6426.9
[ __ ] if it's some stupid kid doing that

6424.44 --> 6429.599999999999
yeah it's a stupid kid

6426.9 --> 6432.42
it's probably killed more people than

6429.6 --> 6434.6990000000005
you could ever imagine before they even

6432.42 --> 6438.0
reach that age yeah

6434.699 --> 6441.0599999999995
you just [ __ ] shoot them and stop

6438.0 --> 6444.239
being so [ __ ] retardedly sentimental

6441.06 --> 6446.719
about it yeah nobody gives a [ __ ] about

6444.239 --> 6450.659
your [ __ ] sentimentality French

6446.719 --> 6453.179
nobody gives a [ __ ] about your [ __ ]

6450.659 --> 6454.379999999999
sentimentality

6453.179 --> 6457.5
yeah

6454.38 --> 6459.2390000000005
that's the one thing we don't give a

6457.5 --> 6464.159
[ __ ] about

6459.239 --> 6466.94
yeah stop being whiny little [ __ ] and

6464.159 --> 6466.94
get to action

6472.08 --> 6476.699
ah

6473.699 --> 6476.699
well

6477.9 --> 6480.799999999999
sun is back

6480.9 --> 6484.699
and I'm all heated up

6497.6 --> 6502.58
I just think I'm done for now with rants

6540.659 --> 6542.78
okay

6543.139 --> 6549.84
can you do Arnold Schwarzenegger giving

6545.82 --> 6549.84
the friend some advice no

6555.179 --> 6561.38
like I don't think Arnold is very good

6558.239 --> 6561.379999999999
at talking French

6565.739 --> 6569.48
I'm not even going to try

6585.9 --> 6590.219
but I mean I could say get to the

6587.88 --> 6592.5
chopper but I mean you'd have to have a

6590.219 --> 6594.78
chopper

6592.5 --> 6596.58
I mean yeah sure the French police has a

6594.78 --> 6602.0599999999995
couple of Choppers but I mean it's not

6596.58 --> 6602.0599999999995
gonna be enough to use in an assault

6602.34 --> 6608.719
unless you have a minigun

6605.06 --> 6608.719
that could help

6614.94 --> 6621.0599999999995
yeah Arnold is in the bootle yes he is

6617.48 --> 6624.739
screw your freedom

6621.06 --> 6624.7390000000005
and he's a climate [ __ ]

6648.179 --> 6652.639
he says he's speaking Yeah well he is a

6650.34 --> 6652.639
liar

6652.86 --> 6658.259999999999
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Shameless to

6655.56 --> 6660.119000000001
your face liar

6658.26 --> 6664.04
and he thinks he can do that because

6660.119 --> 6664.04
he's Superior than everybody else

6664.34 --> 6667.88
thank you

6672.18 --> 6677.58
[Music]

6675.179 --> 6680.28
but Arnold will just straight out lie to

6677.58 --> 6682.679
your face he doesn't give a [ __ ] you'll

6680.28 --> 6685.619
say whatever he wants to say

6682.679 --> 6687.6
or whatever he wants to fantasize to be

6685.619 --> 6690.119
real he doesn't care

6687.6 --> 6692.34
it's not pathological he just doesn't

6690.119 --> 6693.96
care whether he speaks the truth or lies

6692.34 --> 6697.34
he just doesn't care

6693.96 --> 6697.34
he's a he's a scumbag

6704.46 --> 6711.44
and by the way he was always a scumbag

6707.04 --> 6711.44
he really was and a [ __ ]

6720.3 --> 6724.38
it's just that he happened to be in a

6722.76 --> 6727.679
couple of movies that were pretty damn

6724.38 --> 6731.719
impressive and that's it

6727.679 --> 6731.719
he always was a scumbag

6765.0 --> 6771.8
you have your own ideas of earning

6768.9 --> 6771.799999999999
okay

6772.98 --> 6777.959999999999
you're not alone you do oh well whatever

6775.679 --> 6780.6
man I'm just gonna say what it is he's a

6777.96 --> 6783.179
lying scumbag and he's a [ __ ]

6780.6 --> 6786.5
but I mean that's not really secret

6783.179 --> 6786.5
information or anything

6786.54 --> 6793.92
it's just that people are wisening up to

6790.26 --> 6796.320000000001
it more now because like the star flare

6793.92 --> 6797.52
that he used to have during Terminator 2

6796.32 --> 6800.58
and all that

6797.52 --> 6802.8
that's worn off like

6800.58 --> 6805.5
people are not Star Struck by him

6802.8 --> 6807.84
anymore they just see him for the actual

6805.5 --> 6811.159
scumbag that he really is and always was

6807.84 --> 6811.159000000001
that's the difference

6826.06 --> 6832.080000000001
[Music]

6829.08 --> 6832.08
foreign

6846.02 --> 6852.9800000000005
I mean he was completely saturated with

6849.78 --> 6852.98
steroids and all that

6855.9 --> 6861.0
and just look at me now it's like it

6858.78 --> 6863.04
doesn't it doesn't even seem like the

6861.0 --> 6866.78
same person I mean the only thing that's

6863.04 --> 6866.78
really the same is kind of his face

6870.3 --> 6875.400000000001
a little bit you can still recognize his

6873.179 --> 6878.34
face but I mean the rest I mean there's

6875.4 --> 6882.179
nothing like the same guy because it was

6878.34 --> 6884.639
completely artificially pumped up

6882.179 --> 6888.3
I mean you just take like a bicycle pump

6884.639 --> 6890.88
and just go and then you get an Arnold

6888.3 --> 6894.42
that's exactly what it was that's not

6890.88 --> 6896.46
natural guys nobody naturally grows like

6894.42 --> 6898.76
that

6896.46 --> 6898.76
foreign

6910.86 --> 6915.54
oh God yeah Richard yeah remember he

6913.56 --> 6919.080000000001
even had a [ __ ] movie about that it

6915.54 --> 6922.739
was so weird that was so lame

6919.08 --> 6925.34
it was like why why why would you even

6922.739 --> 6925.339999999999
do that

6926.46 --> 6930.6
I think that was like the end of of the

6929.219 --> 6933.0
beginning of the end when he started

6930.6 --> 6935.400000000001
doing that it was like okay well All

6933.0 --> 6939.98
That Glory you had with the Terminator

6935.4 --> 6939.98
series you just [ __ ] it all up now

6940.619 --> 6946.679
and it I don't think any actual really

6944.58 --> 6949.139
good movies

6946.679 --> 6953.119
came after that that he was in it really

6949.139 --> 6953.119
was the end when he started doing that

6956.159 --> 6961.679
because before that people still just

6958.32 --> 6965.04
could think of him as a badass

6961.679 --> 6967.8
but that was just like okay this is just

6965.04 --> 6970.82
not [ __ ] funny anymore it's just

6967.8 --> 6970.820000000001
[ __ ] up and gross

6984.119 --> 6988.46
oh god it worked yeah

7002.6 --> 7008.360000000001
that stands us

7005.42 --> 7010.28
okay and to live in Qatar could you

7008.36 --> 7013.04
translate that I don't know the national

7010.28 --> 7016.599999999999
anthem or France

7013.04 --> 7016.6
what is this stun's ass

7035.06 --> 7037.659000000001
what

7047.78 --> 7053.5599999999995
okay French Revolution

7051.38 --> 7053.56
foreign

7053.719 --> 7059.179
yeah that's kind of that's funny that

7056.42 --> 7061.9
you mentioned it you're right

7059.179 --> 7061.9
you're right

7062.0 --> 7066.739
it is basically about war

7064.46 --> 7069.139
so yeah I mean

7066.739 --> 7071.54
the anthem

7069.139 --> 7073.52
if they just actually listen to what it

7071.54 --> 7077.139
said and then started saying it yeah

7073.52 --> 7077.139
that might actually help him out

7077.42 --> 7080.9800000000005
remember who they really are

7096.38 --> 7101.56
yeah so I don't know the French Anthem I

7098.84 --> 7101.56
don't know the song

7104.719 --> 7111.86
look guys to be fair I've never been a

7108.5 --> 7114.619
big fan of French people

7111.86 --> 7117.32
but I'm willing to give them a chance to

7114.619 --> 7119.598999999999
at least survive this [ __ ] right

7117.32 --> 7121.4
but I've always been saying and always

7119.599 --> 7123.4400000000005
been making this joke and this has been

7121.4 --> 7126.5599999999995
like my entire life

7123.44 --> 7128.98
it's like I love France what a beautiful

7126.56 --> 7128.9800000000005
country

7131.84 --> 7135.58
that's like the only downside

7135.619 --> 7141.0199999999995
yeah because I don't really like the

7138.5 --> 7144.02
French really they they don't know how

7141.02 --> 7146.599
to speak any other [ __ ] language

7144.02 --> 7149.06
they're super arrogant

7146.599 --> 7150.26
and cocky and they think they're all

7149.06 --> 7151.820000000001
that

7150.26 --> 7153.9800000000005
because that's just like kind of a

7151.82 --> 7155.659
general attitude and it's I don't like

7153.98 --> 7157.699
it I don't like the French I think

7155.659 --> 7160.04
they're annoying

7157.699 --> 7161.54
and I think they're kind of gross too I

7160.04 --> 7164.239
mean

7161.54 --> 7167.179
their Liberals are really gross they

7164.239 --> 7170.36
were always like way too overtly sexual

7167.179 --> 7172.34
with things like like it's just gross I

7170.36 --> 7174.5
don't like the French

7172.34 --> 7177.32
but

7174.5 --> 7180.02
like if they can actually find that

7177.32 --> 7183.679
other side of them that really serious

7180.02 --> 7186.139
War side then at least I'll get some

7183.679 --> 7188.2390000000005
respect for them back

7186.139 --> 7189.92
in the face of this new situation

7188.239 --> 7191.239
they're they're finding themselves in

7189.92 --> 7192.619
more and more

7191.239 --> 7196.699
right

7192.619 --> 7199.94
what I mean yeah if they completely fail

7196.699 --> 7202.82
I'm not gonna grieve for the French I'm

7199.94 --> 7206.0599999999995
like gonna be like oh well yeah that

7202.82 --> 7208.82
took a little longer than I expected

7206.06 --> 7211.159000000001
that that will be my response I mean I

7208.82 --> 7213.44
will be worried because now it's ruled

7211.159 --> 7215.119
by a bunch of scumbags from a from

7213.44 --> 7217.699
another part of the world that should

7215.119 --> 7219.38
have been exterminated a long time ago

7217.699 --> 7223.04
and then they're probably gonna come

7219.38 --> 7224.2390000000005
after us like that's would be my worry

7223.04 --> 7226.639
right

7224.239 --> 7228.879999999999
but the French people on themselves it's

7226.639 --> 7228.88
like

7230.0 --> 7235.4
and I mean I'm really sorry there are

7232.4 --> 7236.179
some real [ __ ] French Crushers out

7235.4 --> 7238.82
there

7236.179 --> 7241.58
especially the farmers I the farmers

7238.82 --> 7243.86
there I do think they're very cool the

7241.58 --> 7246.26
issue is though is that our farmers are

7243.86 --> 7249.259999999999
much cooler and smarter

7246.26 --> 7252.92
okay yeah so that I said it

7249.26 --> 7255.26
Dutch farmers are much more badass than

7252.92 --> 7257.659
French Farmers although French Farmers

7255.26 --> 7262.46
probably

7257.659 --> 7265.4
would be more more capable

7262.46 --> 7266.78
because of the all the the old way of

7265.4 --> 7270.619
the French

7266.78 --> 7273.679
they'd be more dangerous as Warriors

7270.619 --> 7275.659
than the Dutch Farmers perhaps

7273.679 --> 7278.42
but the Dutch farmers are just better at

7275.659 --> 7280.098999999999
farming just a fact

7278.42 --> 7282.679
way more

7280.099 --> 7284.719
but there's still some awesome French

7282.679 --> 7288.04
people out there that I've just never

7284.719 --> 7288.04
really met for some reason

7288.32 --> 7290.96
but

7289.46 --> 7294.139
yeah

7290.96 --> 7297.199
I've never had a really high opinion of

7294.139 --> 7299.599
French culture to be fair I don't like

7297.199 --> 7301.159
their wines I don't like their food I

7299.599 --> 7303.4400000000005
really don't

7301.159 --> 7305.96
I mean I've been through France from

7303.44 --> 7308.48
plenty of times because every time me

7305.96 --> 7311.9
and my parents would go to Spain on

7308.48 --> 7315.44
holiday on vacation for months for a

7311.9 --> 7317.96
month we would always go through France

7315.44 --> 7319.94
it would be like a day travel through

7317.96 --> 7321.92
France with the car

7319.94 --> 7324.759999999999
and then you would eat at a French

7321.92 --> 7327.9400000000005
restaurant and sleep in a French Hotel

7324.76 --> 7331.9400000000005
and eating in France

7327.94 --> 7331.94
always sucked

7332.38 --> 7339.26
it always sucked

7336.139 --> 7342.4400000000005
I've never been to a French restaurant

7339.26 --> 7344.42
where I actually liked what I got to eat

7342.44 --> 7348.259999999999
never

7344.42 --> 7350.78
all French food sucks

7348.26 --> 7354.7390000000005
I mean it might be great for you that's

7350.78 --> 7358.58
great deal no thanks

7354.739 --> 7360.739
like pretty much any country

7358.58 --> 7363.0199999999995
is cool with me when it comes to food

7360.739 --> 7365.36
but not France they're just [ __ ]

7363.02 --> 7367.780000000001
disgusting they eat snails for crying

7365.36 --> 7367.78
out loud

7372.44 --> 7377.36
and I don't like their line

7374.719 --> 7379.96
I like Spanish wine much better than

7377.36 --> 7379.96
French wine

7387.88 --> 7394.58
right but I do hope despite all that

7392.239 --> 7398.598999999999
I mean I'd rather have the [ __ ]

7394.58 --> 7402.0199999999995
French there with their gross food and

7398.599 --> 7404.54
their their their like lingual ineptness

7402.02 --> 7408.02
I'd rather have them than a bunch of

7404.54 --> 7412.179
third world [ __ ] scumbags that are

7408.02 --> 7412.179
super anti-european racist

7412.699 --> 7418.219
and just disgusting

7415.219 --> 7420.88
demons I'd rather have the French than

7418.219 --> 7420.88
those people

7421.28 --> 7424.0
definitely

7425.179 --> 7430.639
I mean

7426.92 --> 7432.9800000000005
I can if these [ __ ] win over France

7430.639 --> 7435.139
and France completely Get Wrecked and

7432.98 --> 7436.759999999999
basically taken up by these [ __ ]

7435.139 --> 7439.58
scumbags

7436.76 --> 7440.84
then I can't go to Spain again

7439.58 --> 7443.42
because

7440.84 --> 7445.6990000000005
I'm not gonna drive through France with

7443.42 --> 7448.28
these [ __ ] scumbags that are probably

7445.699 --> 7452.36
like set car bombs on the side of the

7448.28 --> 7455.0199999999995
highway yeah how about

7452.36 --> 7455.0199999999995
not

7455.84 --> 7461.3
if they win

7457.52 --> 7464.4800000000005
Europe will be absolutely broken down

7461.3 --> 7467.54
because France is in the middle of

7464.48 --> 7469.82
Europe it's literally in the middle of

7467.54 --> 7471.26
the entirety of Europe if it gets caught

7469.82 --> 7474.679
off

7471.26 --> 7476.0
then logistically it will be a gigantic

7474.679 --> 7479.2390000000005
nightmare

7476.0 --> 7480.92
that's like you can't overcome that

7479.239 --> 7482.0
like where are you gonna go with your

7480.92 --> 7483.86
trucks

7482.0 --> 7485.48
if you want from the south to the North

7483.86 --> 7487.88
or the North to the South or from the

7485.48 --> 7490.94
West to the you're not gonna go anywhere

7487.88 --> 7493.52
yeah because France is no longer

7490.94 --> 7494.21
accessible then and it's in the middle

7493.52 --> 7496.099
of everything

7494.21 --> 7498.9800000000005
[Music]

7496.099 --> 7501.8
if France gets completely shut down

7498.98 --> 7505.0
because of this [ __ ] anti-european

7501.8 --> 7509.0
Revolution then Europe will completely

7505.0 --> 7509.0
collapse majestically

7512.719 --> 7517.3
I bet nobody hasn't really thought about

7514.76 --> 7517.3
that before

7531.26 --> 7535.900000000001
I'm gonna call this show Viva La

7533.42 --> 7535.9
Revolution

7536.19 --> 7545.349999999999
[Music]

7554.659 --> 7559.638999999999
ah wow

7557.84 --> 7563.179
man

7559.639 --> 7566.3
dude that's two hours later

7563.179 --> 7568.099
man I did I thought like oh yeah what am

7566.3 --> 7569.96
I gonna talk about the next hour of the

7568.099 --> 7571.400000000001
show but I guess that next hour is

7569.96 --> 7574.4
already over

7571.4 --> 7574.4
huh

7590.92 --> 7596.06
right so yeah

7593.54 --> 7597.92
I'm not in a hurry to round out

7596.06 --> 7601.900000000001
Flat Earth debate is not going to be

7597.92 --> 7601.9
live probably this entire week

7601.94 --> 7608.719
maybe live Thursday or Friday but

7605.96 --> 7611.719
definitely not today and tomorrow

7608.719 --> 7611.719
unfortunately

7637.88 --> 7640.88
foreign

7655.719 --> 7660.679
do I get my channel shut down for I

7658.58 --> 7663.139
don't even care I mean

7660.679 --> 7664.82
we all know that's what's happening I

7663.139 --> 7667.4800000000005
don't have to talk about it I don't have

7664.82 --> 7667.48
to mention it

7679.52 --> 7684.5
I mean that's default

7681.98 --> 7686.299999999999
like why would I even talk about that

7684.5 --> 7688.28
yeah of course they're doing all that

7686.3 --> 7690.860000000001
they're openly doing it what's up with

7688.28 --> 7695.42
fvd Nathan's computer is pretty much

7690.86 --> 7698.48
broken it it told like his processor

7695.42 --> 7700.88
just completely burned out

7698.48 --> 7705.28
so he's taking it to the shop and

7700.88 --> 7705.28
getting like new parts replaced again

7716.179 --> 7720.92
any ideas on the legitimacy of human

7719.239 --> 7723.0199999999995
NPCs

7720.92 --> 7725.42
what

7723.02 --> 7728.540000000001
well you can't take it literal of course

7725.42 --> 7731.78
more color but I mean what NPC typically

7728.54 --> 7735.94
is is an autopilot mechanism

7731.78 --> 7735.94
now what we typically identify

7744.199 --> 7751.219
is the people that go on autopilot

7747.739 --> 7753.919999999999
with the really dumb overt liberal [ __ ]

7751.219 --> 7756.56
that's who we see as NPCs the people

7753.92 --> 7759.02
that basically start echoing the

7756.56 --> 7762.679
mainstream news

7759.02 --> 7765.320000000001
an advertisement lingo all that [ __ ]

7762.679 --> 7767.2390000000005
that's what we call NPCs but it is

7765.32 --> 7770.619
basically an autopilot mechanism and

7767.239 --> 7774.5599999999995
there's different Lanes you can sit on

7770.619 --> 7776.719
with your autopilot yeah

7774.56 --> 7777.619000000001
let's just say I have an autofinance

7776.719 --> 7781.099
system

7777.619 --> 7785.119
it's on a quite a different rail as the

7781.099 --> 7788.3
NPC autopilot I'm rather like

7785.119 --> 7791.0199999999995
the exact opposite but I do have an

7788.3 --> 7791.02
autopilot

7791.84 --> 7796.52
but I mean my my autopilot is more that

7794.719 --> 7799.82
of like

7796.52 --> 7802.3
at the German National Socialist in the

7799.82 --> 7802.299999999999
30s

7803.06 --> 7808.400000000001
like beef like not

7805.699 --> 7810.44
the SS Squad but the the others like

7808.4 --> 7813.92
that's my autopilot like really

7810.44 --> 7817.219
nationalist like local defensive

7813.92 --> 7820.36
traditional Role Models like that that's

7817.219 --> 7820.36
my autopilot

7820.4 --> 7827.0599999999995
that's how I behave automatically

7823.52 --> 7830.360000000001
but it it is not normal anymore that

7827.06 --> 7832.6990000000005
used to be normal before my lifetime and

7830.36 --> 7834.86
I really long for that back

7832.699 --> 7837.46
so I had to become it it's the only way

7834.86 --> 7837.46
to get it back

7837.92 --> 7842.9
so that's my

7839.96 --> 7845.179
that's my NPC Lane

7842.9 --> 7848.598999999999
and not the [ __ ] liberal one and even

7845.179 --> 7850.099
when I kind of try to be more liberal

7848.599 --> 7851.84
because I thought that it was actually

7850.099 --> 7854.96
better

7851.84 --> 7856.9400000000005
I even wouldn't autopilot I would it

7854.96 --> 7858.86
would be a more conscious form of

7856.94 --> 7861.799999999999
liberalism

7858.86 --> 7864.259999999999
really believing like no no yeah you

7861.8 --> 7867.26
just gonna do it like this and that and

7864.26 --> 7869.96
and Opposites Attract and like sort of

7867.26 --> 7875.1990000000005
an Alchemy approach but not autopilot

7869.96 --> 7875.199
I'm not an NPC Like That Never Was

7875.599 --> 7883.28
I was more much more of a consciously

7878.36 --> 7885.619
choosing liberal that was also idealist

7883.28 --> 7888.08
on top of that and therefore kind of

7885.619 --> 7890.299999999999
naive as to the darkness that was

7888.08 --> 7893.0
actually behind it all I didn't see it

7890.3 --> 7894.38
when I was younger I couldn't see it I

7893.0 --> 7895.52
couldn't believe it people would tell me

7894.38 --> 7897.8
and I would be like what are you talking

7895.52 --> 7900.679
about that makes no sense

7897.8 --> 7902.360000000001
I would be why would somebody on top be

7900.679 --> 7904.9400000000005
so evil

7902.36 --> 7908.239
why would they build a entire structure

7904.94 --> 7911.0
for enthusiastic good people to

7908.239 --> 7913.699
to take part in and like it just didn't

7911.0 --> 7917.719
make sense at all

7913.699 --> 7919.879999999999
and in a way it still doesn't make sense

7917.719 --> 7922.28
but there is a fact that there are

7919.88 --> 7924.88
really [ __ ] evil people conspiring at

7922.28 --> 7928.5199999999995
the top of like

7924.88 --> 7930.1990000000005
managerial government functions and they

7928.52 --> 7932.179
infiltrate and they are really

7930.199 --> 7935.0599999999995
anti-human

7932.179 --> 7940.639
and psychopathic

7935.06 --> 7944.0
but they don't create the actual systems

7940.639 --> 7947.4800000000005
they infiltrate and then they abuse the

7944.0 --> 7950.119
systems to destroy the systems

7947.48 --> 7952.28
so in a sense they don't they are not

7950.119 --> 7955.82
the designers

7952.28 --> 7958.82
of the system they're the ones that are

7955.82 --> 7960.5
getting in to destroy it

7958.82 --> 7962.42
and that's something I just didn't

7960.5 --> 7964.28
understand when I was younger I didn't

7962.42 --> 7966.619
have the oversight over how all of that

7964.28 --> 7969.259999999999
will work I have much better oversight

7966.619 --> 7972.259999999999
now also thanks to just the elaborate

7969.26 --> 7974.54
media that's available now yeah because

7972.26 --> 7978.079000000001
internet media

7974.54 --> 7980.92
was not available until my late teens

7978.079 --> 7980.92
you see

7981.38 --> 7986.42
like before I was

7984.079 --> 7990.38
18

7986.42 --> 7992.659
there was only modem internet and there

7990.38 --> 7995.659000000001
was barely websites the modem internet

7992.659 --> 7998.96
was really for chatting

7995.659 --> 8001.598999999999
as MSN Messenger right that's what we

7998.96 --> 8003.34
would do with it that was like oh we can

8001.599 --> 8005.619000000001
chat certainly it's cheaper than the

8003.34 --> 8007.360000000001
phone that's it

8005.619 --> 8009.4
it wasn't really cheaper than the phone

8007.36 --> 8011.259999999999
with the modem that you had to call in

8009.4 --> 8013.299999999999
with but the point was is that that's

8011.26 --> 8015.9400000000005
like the internet phase that I got

8013.3 --> 8018.46
through in my teens it was really in my

8015.94 --> 8020.98
20s when the actual internet started to

8018.46 --> 8023.44
happen you get Google Vid Google video

8020.98 --> 8027.36
and then YouTube

8023.44 --> 8027.36
and that's when it really hit off

8028.179 --> 8033.46
I didn't get I didn't live through that

8030.52 --> 8035.9800000000005
in my teens in my teens it wasn't there

8033.46 --> 8040.06
there was television

8035.98 --> 8043.0199999999995
and there was at related teens there was

8040.06 --> 8043.02
some internet

8046.179 --> 8049.54
some but it was still mostly just

8048.219 --> 8051.82
television

8049.54 --> 8053.56
now that was the source for things you

8051.82 --> 8055.659
didn't have an internet in the

8053.56 --> 8056.22
alternative new sites you didn't have

8055.659 --> 8059.398999999999
any of that

8056.22 --> 8059.399
[Music]

8060.34 --> 8065.139
like the even real first alternative

8062.98 --> 8066.82
stuff that I got into was like Alex

8065.139 --> 8068.9800000000005
Jones

8066.82 --> 8071.259999999999
with like

8068.98 --> 8075.5199999999995
some of his movies and that all happened

8071.26 --> 8077.92
like after 2006.

8075.52 --> 8079.3
or before or even like I got a terror

8077.92 --> 8081.639
storm

8079.3 --> 8085.5
yeah when I was I don't know that that

8081.639 --> 8085.5
was 2006 or five or something

8088.239 --> 8092.678999999999
in the end game

8090.34 --> 8095.9800000000005
but that was like before that I never

8092.679 --> 8099.76
even heard of any of that

8095.98 --> 8103.0599999999995
because it just wasn't really there

8099.76 --> 8106.3
now there's alternative media out of

8103.06 --> 8109.179
your ass everywhere and it is kind of

8106.3 --> 8112.96
dilapidated and shitty

8109.179 --> 8115.719
it's less research because back then

8112.96 --> 8120.88
all these conspiracy theory people they

8115.719 --> 8123.34
did mostly research now there is a media

8120.88 --> 8126.04
everywhere an alternative media

8123.34 --> 8127.84
everywhere talking all the time every

8126.04 --> 8130.0
day

8127.84 --> 8132.9400000000005
back then it wasn't there all you had

8130.0 --> 8134.679
was books and how do I get the all the

8132.94 --> 8137.799999999999
information from the books reading like

8134.679 --> 8138.9400000000005
a [ __ ] madman every day like way too

8137.8 --> 8141.6990000000005
much information that was what Alex

8138.94 --> 8143.919999999999
Jones was doing in that time you even

8141.699 --> 8145.9
talks about it just reading all the

8143.92 --> 8148.4400000000005
[ __ ] time read read it read it read

8145.9 --> 8150.28
and then like oh

8148.44 --> 8152.079
comprehended and then make a

8150.28 --> 8153.639
presentation out of it or maybe a movie

8152.079 --> 8157.719
or something

8153.639 --> 8160.719
now it's just like there is too much

8157.719 --> 8163.2390000000005
information people don't have time to

8160.719 --> 8165.159
read books this is

8163.239 --> 8166.54
they don't have the time anymore there's

8165.159 --> 8169.239
too much

8166.54 --> 8171.82
stuff already out

8169.239 --> 8174.04
just like

8171.82 --> 8176.679
there's so many

8174.04 --> 8178.599
alternative documentaries out there it

8176.679 --> 8180.46
you can't keep track of it

8178.599 --> 8181.96
there's been things out that we haven't

8180.46 --> 8184.179
even heard of

8181.96 --> 8186.82
because we were too busy watching

8184.179 --> 8189.46
another alternative movie alternative

8186.82 --> 8191.679
documentary that was coming out at the

8189.46 --> 8194.019
exact same time because it's everywhere

8191.679 --> 8196.12
you can't keep track anymore so it just

8194.019 --> 8199.42
doesn't work the same back in the day

8196.12 --> 8202.54
they all had to read like crazy and then

8199.42 --> 8204.7
compile that information somehow make it

8202.54 --> 8207.04
comprehensible to somebody that hadn't

8204.7 --> 8209.380000000001
read read a hundred books

8207.04 --> 8211.899000000001
now it's all different because it just

8209.38 --> 8214.119999999999
all comes through media and a lot of

8211.899 --> 8216.639
information you get through other people

8214.12 --> 8218.740000000002
through media it's like somebody reads

8216.639 --> 8220.779999999999
this book makes an elaborate

8218.74 --> 8223.0
presentation about it what are you gonna

8220.78 --> 8225.519
do read the book no you're gonna watch

8223.0 --> 8229.12
the presentation

8225.519 --> 8231.880000000001
because it's super super much quicker

8229.12 --> 8235.359
it's so much quicker to do that and you

8231.88 --> 8239.858999999999
can just get through more that way

8235.359 --> 8241.960000000001
and but that does change the way things

8239.859 --> 8244.059000000001
work

8241.96 --> 8248.018999999998
because now

8244.059 --> 8252.179
there's a lot out there that is known

8248.019 --> 8252.179
but we know it through others

8253.059 --> 8258.639
you understand now you don't know it all

8256.059 --> 8260.38
from just having read this book and that

8258.639 --> 8262.3
book and that book and that book and you

8260.38 --> 8266.438999999998
know it like everything you know is in

8262.3 --> 8269.438999999998
those books now we know through other

8266.439 --> 8270.939
people we've heard of these things

8269.439 --> 8274.12
and then you

8270.939 --> 8277.24
Sense on the source like how reliable is

8274.12 --> 8279.28
this person how much do I know him do I

8277.24 --> 8280.179
know that it would actually be careful

8279.28 --> 8283.960000000001
enough

8280.179 --> 8286.359
to present things correctly

8283.96 --> 8289.66
Etc and by that standard you then size

8286.359 --> 8292.0
up the value of the information he has

8289.66 --> 8294.219
and then maybe cross-reference does

8292.0 --> 8296.8
anybody else talk about that well yeah

8294.219 --> 8299.32
these days any subject there will be

8296.8 --> 8302.679
thousands of people talking about it and

8299.32 --> 8304.359
a lot of them will be complete [ __ ]

8302.679 --> 8307.12
and some of them will be really

8304.359 --> 8309.219000000001
informative it's up to you to figure out

8307.12 --> 8311.380000000001
which person is actually a reliable

8309.219 --> 8313.779999999999
source and which isn't right so that's

8311.38 --> 8316.42
how it works now people don't know all

8313.78 --> 8319.599
these things from having read the book

8316.42 --> 8320.92
they know them through good sources on

8319.599 --> 8323.92
the internet

8320.92 --> 8325.84
that you feel this is reliable this is

8323.92 --> 8327.76
unique enough like there's always

8325.84 --> 8329.08
something new coming through this corner

8327.76 --> 8330.939
that doesn't come through the other

8329.08 --> 8333.099
Corners except years later

8330.939 --> 8335.979000000001
right and then it doesn't even matter

8333.099 --> 8338.380000000001
whether the person is crazy or whatever

8335.979 --> 8341.08
or not really good at talking

8338.38 --> 8342.82
he gets the good info very quick and

8341.08 --> 8344.139
then you have that as a source it's a

8342.82 --> 8347.08
quick source

8344.139 --> 8349.179
for new things early

8347.08 --> 8351.7
and then you have the other type of

8349.179 --> 8354.16
source of the person that's really good

8351.7 --> 8358.0
at explaining something

8354.16 --> 8360.219
in his field perfectly right like you

8358.0 --> 8363.399
really wanted Nathan Oakley or Quantum

8360.219 --> 8365.5
eraser source for physics and Flat Earth

8363.399 --> 8368.46
because they're super detailed and very

8365.5 --> 8368.46
good at explaining it

8368.62 --> 8372.34
right

8369.88 --> 8375.88
I am another type of source I like to be

8372.34 --> 8377.32
the source that gets things very early

8375.88 --> 8380.74
so

8377.32 --> 8384.88
Nathan is much more of a specialist

8380.74 --> 8387.479
Source I am much more of a early bird

8384.88 --> 8387.479
source

8388.3 --> 8393.82
are you guys still following me

8391.6 --> 8395.92
talking about sources

8393.82 --> 8398.52
and how it's different now compared to

8395.92 --> 8398.52
the 90s

8399.16 --> 8403.479
how do we do research what are

8401.32 --> 8405.279999999999
conspiracy theories now because in the

8403.479 --> 8406.84
90s there were cookie conspiracy

8405.28 --> 8409.92
theories they would read like a hundred

8406.84 --> 8412.72
books and then be all awkward and

8409.92 --> 8414.399
weirded out and super disappointed and

8412.72 --> 8415.42
always getting bullied by the regular

8414.399 --> 8419.619999999999
people

8415.42 --> 8422.439
right but now

8419.62 --> 8424.54
you don't find those types anymore not

8422.439 --> 8427.24
like that because

8424.54 --> 8429.939
most of them have gotten the recognition

8427.24 --> 8432.52
that they actually need it for their

8429.939 --> 8434.14
insights by now because of the internet

8432.52 --> 8436.12
spreading around the information people

8434.14 --> 8439.358999999999
figuring it out quicker

8436.12 --> 8441.460000000001
and it's just much more room to talk

8439.359 --> 8444.220000000001
about more people talk about more

8441.46 --> 8447.039999999999
obscure subjects and go into detail

8444.22 --> 8449.438999999998
thanks to the internet it wasn't there

8447.04 --> 8452.319000000001
in the 90s in the 90s if you were a

8449.439 --> 8455.68
conspiracy theorist that read 100 books

8452.319 --> 8459.119999999999
you had to make a presentation go to a

8455.68 --> 8462.64
special meeting UFO meeting

8459.12 --> 8465.220000000001
conspiracy theory meeting oh The Fifth

8462.64 --> 8467.8
Dimension meeting whatever it was about

8465.22 --> 8471.099999999999
and then do your presentation in front

8467.8 --> 8474.099999999999
of 20 maybe 40 people or something and

8471.1 --> 8476.2
that's the only way you could actually

8474.1 --> 8477.640000000001
spread that information

8476.2 --> 8479.740000000002
now

8477.64 --> 8481.599999999999
it's very easy to spread that

8479.74 --> 8484.66
information and so you don't see any

8481.6 --> 8486.58
more of the the kooky type conspiracy

8484.66 --> 8488.2
theories like that

8486.58 --> 8491.08
I mean you have a bunch of [ __ ]

8488.2 --> 8493.6
blabbermouth conspiracy theorists but

8491.08 --> 8496.42
not the awkward ones that are like

8493.6 --> 8499.6
having social isolation issues

8496.42 --> 8502.06
because everybody thinks they're crazy

8499.6 --> 8504.04
that doesn't that's not out there

8502.06 --> 8505.72
anymore those people have recovered from

8504.04 --> 8508.18
that because of the internet because

8505.72 --> 8511.358999999999
they can now definitely connect to a

8508.18 --> 8514.06
massive amount of people very easily

8511.359 --> 8515.92
instead of having to prepare a

8514.06 --> 8517.96
presentation that you could maybe do

8515.92 --> 8520.84
once or twice a year

8517.96 --> 8523.419999999998
now you can do it with a community on a

8520.84 --> 8524.380000000001
daily basis on the internet and that's

8523.42 --> 8526.479
really

8524.38 --> 8529.599999999999
transform those types of people made

8526.479 --> 8532.72
them less socially awkward

8529.6 --> 8535.24
so now the socially awkward

8532.72 --> 8537.76
tinfoil had conspiracy theorist is now

8535.24 --> 8541.06
reserved for stupid stereotype

8537.76 --> 8543.34
characters in in Hollywood movies that's

8541.06 --> 8546.22
the place where you still find them in

8543.34 --> 8547.23
reality they don't exist anymore not

8546.22 --> 8550.458999999999
like that

8547.23 --> 8550.458999999999
[Music]

8551.859 --> 8554.460000000001
anyway

8561.1 --> 8565.54
and I mean even in movies they're they

8563.2 --> 8567.399000000001
are becoming kind of a favorite thing

8565.54 --> 8569.560000000001
I mean we're missing the kooky

8567.399 --> 8572.14
conspiracy theories I miss the Corky

8569.56 --> 8574.66
conspiracy theorists

8572.14 --> 8576.099999999999
there's a plenty of retards that'll talk

8574.66 --> 8578.56
about anything that they absolutely

8576.1 --> 8581.26
don't understand anything about

8578.56 --> 8583.24
there's very little high Specialists

8581.26 --> 8585.939
that are socially awkward

8583.24 --> 8589.14
I used to love talking to those people

8585.939 --> 8592.300000000001
because I have super details

8589.14 --> 8595.18
detailed inquiry yeah guess what cookie

8592.3 --> 8599.019999999999
conspiracy theories none are better than

8595.18 --> 8600.76
two very detailed answer complicated

8599.02 --> 8605.04
Niche questions

8600.76 --> 8605.04
nobody's better at it than those types

8606.46 --> 8610.599999999999
and I miss him

8608.8 --> 8612.938999999998
although I think they're just kind of

8610.6 --> 8615.52
like I don't know hanging around in this

8612.939 --> 8618.460000000001
chat I think that some of you guys are

8615.52 --> 8623.28
just kind of those types

8618.46 --> 8623.279999999999
a lot of them now end up flat earthers

8648.399 --> 8652.119999999999
what how are you talking about

8650.68 --> 8655.08
you're all talking about something

8652.12 --> 8655.08
completely different

8674.92 --> 8677.64
hello

8685.68 --> 8691.02
sometimes I really think you guys just

8688.18 --> 8693.64
don't listen to me at all

8691.02 --> 8695.68
I mean are you actually listening to me

8693.64 --> 8697.08
or you just like the sound of my voice

8695.68 --> 8701.44
in the background rambling

8697.08 --> 8701.44
[Music]

8703.12 --> 8707.5
which is very weird to me because I

8705.7 --> 8711.060000000001
would find my own voice in the

8707.5 --> 8711.06
background quite annoying

8714.88 --> 8719.14
I'd expect that if you're gonna be

8717.399 --> 8721.779999999999
listening to me you're gonna actually

8719.14 --> 8725.34
listen to what I have to say

8721.78 --> 8725.34
and not for my voice

8725.8 --> 8730.8
or maybe I'm wrong about that I don't

8728.62 --> 8730.800000000001
know

8730.96 --> 8735.22
it's Independence Day yeah I know that

8733.0 --> 8735.84
Retro Bill 4th of July

8735.22 --> 8739.069
I know

8735.84 --> 8739.069
[Music]

8740.979 --> 8747.06
but maybe you should just rename it into

8743.88 --> 8747.06
interdependence day

8749.2 --> 8754.800000000001
I think interdependence day would now be

8751.96 --> 8754.8
more appropriate

8760.91 --> 8764.219
[Music]

8778.24 --> 8784.06
right

8780.34 --> 8786.28
unless somebody's like or just get out a

8784.06 --> 8788.5
UFO and freaking blow up the White House

8786.28 --> 8789.28
already and just make it Independence

8788.5 --> 8793.3
Day

8789.28 --> 8794.859
right I mean if UFO comes and blows up

8793.3 --> 8796.179999999998
the White House today in the United

8794.859 --> 8798.880000000001
States

8796.18 --> 8801.34
then I'm content that you'll keep

8798.88 --> 8803.8
calling it Independence Day

8801.34 --> 8806.04
but only under that condition otherwise

8803.8 --> 8809.22
you're gonna have to rename it into

8806.04 --> 8809.220000000001
interdependence day

8809.92 --> 8812.460000000001
right

8818.0 --> 8823.479
[Music]

8820.3 --> 8826.358999999999
so you hear it either you rename it to

8823.479 --> 8829.3
interdependence day or

8826.359 --> 8832.479000000001
you get a UFO to blow up the White House

8829.3 --> 8835.358999999999
and then then you'll definitely be

8832.479 --> 8837.64
calling it Independence Day

8835.359 --> 8839.5
you actually have a good reason to call

8837.64 --> 8841.779999999999
it Independence Day because it directly

8839.5 --> 8847.38
references the movie

8841.78 --> 8847.380000000001
like even the cover of the movie DVD so

8871.359 --> 8877.140000000001
wouldn't that be freaking hilarious by

8873.58 --> 8877.14
the way if that actually happened

8881.38 --> 8886.779999999999
although I think that pretty much any

8884.14 --> 8888.46
reason why if the White House will blow

8886.78 --> 8889.84
up I think that like half the world

8888.46 --> 8893.58
would be cheering at this point

8889.84 --> 8893.58
including half of America

8894.52 --> 8900.16
because

8896.68 --> 8903.880000000001
it's just gone so bad

8900.16 --> 8907.06
I think that the United States

8903.88 --> 8909.58
federal government and the presidency at

8907.06 --> 8913.6
this point is just kind of regarded like

8909.58 --> 8916.0
the end stages of the Roman Empire

8913.6 --> 8919.68
it's like nothing good comes out of this

8916.0 --> 8919.68
just nothing ever

8919.84 --> 8926.34
so maybe it is time a UFO just blew up

8922.42 --> 8926.34
the White House and just be done with it

8936.8 --> 8940.07
[Music]

8942.12 --> 8946.380000000001
what you asked the kid today

8947.38 --> 8951.06
that's hilarious Retro Bill

8951.69 --> 8962.82
[Music]

8963.54 --> 8966.6
thank you

8978.1 --> 8986.979000000001
what really antiluvian well you can't be

8982.24 --> 8989.979
serious 24 are what

8986.979 --> 8989.979
why

8990.46 --> 8993.479
that's crazy

8996.28 --> 9001.02
no it doesn't like why the [ __ ] would it

8999.1 --> 9003.720000000001
matter whether they're liberals I mean

9001.02 --> 9006.899000000001
even as a liberal there's no [ __ ] way

9003.72 --> 9009.599999999999
that you're gonna be happy with this

9006.899 --> 9011.16
this current Whitehead like

9009.6 --> 9014.84
[Music]

9011.16 --> 9014.84
can't be that stupid

9015.42 --> 9019.979
[Music]

9016.74 --> 9023.6
it can't be that's no

9019.979 --> 9023.599999999999
I refuse to believe

9041.46 --> 9047.58
you gotta stop it man you gotta stop

9044.46 --> 9050.339999999998
these [ __ ] liberal nuts these Nut

9047.58 --> 9053.52
Cases it has to stop it's it's a plague

9050.34 --> 9055.56
it's like a communist plague and it

9053.52 --> 9057.78
needs to stop

9055.56 --> 9060.84
needs to be halted it needs to be

9057.78 --> 9063.02
identified for the mental deviation it

9060.84 --> 9063.02
is

9071.939 --> 9075.5
it just needs to end

9101.58 --> 9105.12
made up pull yeah it could be let's hope

9104.22 --> 9109.619999999999
so

9105.12 --> 9111.899000000001
in 24 man they can't seriously be like a

9109.62 --> 9115.560000000001
hundred million people

9111.899 --> 9118.08
that actually consciously knowingly

9115.56 --> 9119.699999999999
support this [ __ ] white house there's

9118.08 --> 9121.319
no way

9119.7 --> 9124.52
this

9121.319 --> 9124.519999999999
like it can't be

9127.859 --> 9133.380000000001
I mean not unless they like directly in

9130.8 --> 9134.699999999999
that moment of asking got paid to say

9133.38 --> 9138.74
that I mean

9134.7 --> 9138.740000000002
that they just can't be

9146.46 --> 9149.58
[Music]

9168.359 --> 9171.02
hmm

9173.46 --> 9178.16
well that's an interesting chart thanks

9175.8 --> 9178.16
for that

9178.62 --> 9182.899000000001
doesn't seem like it's really been very

9180.66 --> 9182.899
good

9186.72 --> 9193.76
although why the hell did Clinton get

9189.18 --> 9193.76
such a good trust score that's weird

9198.42 --> 9202.02
why

9200.45 --> 9204.68
[Music]

9202.02 --> 9204.68
