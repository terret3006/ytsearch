it's just so it's a full-on summer's day

114.189 --> 121.00899999999999
it's like bugs all over the place with

117.5 --> 123.939
every a great time that's good because

121.009 --> 123.93900000000001
the plants need that

129.769 --> 134.56900000000002
blossoming of the tree down there for

133.01 --> 139.849
example what's very short though but

134.569 --> 141.79999999999998
yeah the everything's doing great you if

139.849 --> 144.17
you look carefully you can really see

141.8 --> 148.9
the heat glowing of the sides of the

144.17 --> 153.14
roof there I can see it with my eyes

148.9 --> 159.43
maybe with my p1000 I would be able to

153.14 --> 164.86999999999998
zoom in on it so please also if you can

159.43 --> 167.15

other ways most are in the description

170.299 --> 176.739
box below and I have some regular

173.299 --> 180.26000000000002

184.25 --> 190.12
a proper our winner thumb for that

186.709 --> 194.269
somewhere in the near future

190.12 --> 197.12
yeah for now I got Tamara coffee with me

194.269 --> 199.329
same system as yesterday worked out

197.12 --> 199.329
great

203.26 --> 214.64
that's just perfect and tea I had kind

211.01 --> 220.22
of a hungry morning because I skipped

214.64 --> 225.52999999999997
dinner yesterday oh well I had a very

220.22 --> 229.55
active evening long conversation with a

225.53 --> 231.34
good friend of mine who's a mother by

229.55 --> 235.09
the way so the good constant mother

231.34 --> 238.28
stories and it's pretty like holy [ __ ]

235.09 --> 240.53
like for example I also watched Bowen

238.28 --> 243.44
Benjamin this morning by the way but yes

240.53 --> 246.8
they had that phone call and it took

243.44 --> 250.43
like two hours those phone calls are

246.8 --> 252.02
long and it was good

250.43 --> 255.65
I could definitely like she had a lot to

252.02 --> 259.73
bear and I had a lot to share and she

255.65 --> 263.09000000000003
has she can wield real energy she's like

259.73 --> 266.51
a strong mother and spirited person so

263.09 --> 269.9
yeah we really all most yeah we are on

266.51 --> 271.4
equal energy terms at that great

269.9 --> 273.22999999999996
conversations I have a couple of other

271.4 --> 279.78
friends like that but yeah each one is

273.23 --> 282.03000000000003
unique and

279.78 --> 283.73999999999995
now I'm I'm again and this seems to be

282.03 --> 285.69
reoccurring maybe it's the heat but I

283.74 --> 288.12
kind of lose track of the original point

285.69 --> 290.16
I was trying to make this is really

288.12 --> 292.92
annoying actually I hope it's not the

290.16 --> 298.76000000000005
tumeric often probably not it's probably

292.92 --> 301.59000000000003
need proof it is really warm in here I

298.76 --> 307.31
kind of want to take off my shoes it's

301.59 --> 307.31
too warm for that the point the point

308.06 --> 315.23
long conversation right in reflection on

316.35 --> 323.34000000000003
today I only lost track I've just tried

320.34 --> 326.72999999999996
to read sum it up I had the call was

323.34 --> 329.03999999999996
really good heavy intends oh she's such

326.73 --> 332.46000000000004
an intense person always dealing with

329.04 --> 336.66
heavy stuff and she's a good person it's

332.46 --> 339.09
very moral upstanding person very

336.66 --> 343.29
righteous and liberal but in a real

339.09 --> 346.22999999999996
righteous way it's it's impressive but

343.29 --> 349.41
she gets a lot of trouble from other

346.23 --> 352.95000000000005
people I don't know because she yeah I

349.41 --> 357.36
know she's not a large woman so she's

352.95 --> 359.49
kind of slim and tiny very spirited that

357.36 --> 363.72
comes natural usually with us types of

359.49 --> 367.47
builds but yeah she does get pushed

363.72 --> 367.92
around by by other types of people it's

367.47 --> 369.90000000000003
annoying

367.92 --> 371.94
anyway yeah everybody has these types of

369.9 --> 374.42999999999995
issues of their own anyway and we talked

371.94 --> 377.25
a long time she's a great person she

374.43 --> 379.74
helped me out like borrowing lending me

377.25 --> 381.48
money and stuff like it really needed so

379.74 --> 385.65000000000003
it's she's awesome

381.48 --> 387.75
and really reliable at and she helps out

385.65 --> 391.28
even guys that probably don't really

387.75 --> 393.75
deserve it sometimes but she's just so

391.28 --> 396.27
she really wants to believe in the good

393.75 --> 398.76
side of people even though she will have

396.27 --> 401.53999999999996
the eyes in the census to do take note

398.76 --> 407.88
of bad elements she's not oblivious

401.54 --> 411.57
she's just really really tolerant that's

407.88 --> 415.35
good but it brings some issues and yeah

411.57 --> 419.46
I kind of helped her teacher like make

415.35 --> 421.23
her see more what what she is what what

419.46 --> 422.94
is going on and how she could

421.23 --> 425.21000000000004
potentially use her energies and

422.94 --> 427.83
redirect them in certain situations like

425.21 --> 432.21
like a good what a good psychology will

427.83 --> 434.13
do I guess and it just goes intuitively

432.21 --> 436.83
and we have we've known each other we've

434.13 --> 439.95
even had a relationship a long time ago

436.83 --> 442.56
when I was still doing the goldsmithing

439.95 --> 445.86
education which she is a goldsmith as

442.56 --> 447.61
well although not practicing full-time

445.86 --> 453.939
mother pretty much

447.61 --> 455.5
hmm yeah I don't I do my best but

453.939 --> 458.949
because she is a good person and she

455.5 --> 462.909
also helps me like I'm not gonna go one

458.949 --> 466.349
way street direction you know the energy

462.909 --> 466.349
has to be balanced

474.449 --> 481.62
otherwise it's not gonna last it's just

476.4 --> 484.73999999999995
gonna drain me and then until you just

481.62 --> 487.56
crash and I have had those situation I

484.74 --> 489.509
did I was like so super tolerant that I

487.56 --> 491.669
didn't know my limits and I would even

489.509 --> 492.99
like help out people that nobody else

491.669 --> 496.289
would help even though they were

492.99 --> 498.93
obviously socially deranged and we're

496.289 --> 501.15
constantly begging and manipulating and

498.93 --> 503.039
[ __ ] and I will always get these types

501.15 --> 509.099
behind me because I would help them out

503.039 --> 512.13
like seriously and now I'm much more

509.099 --> 514.2
careful I really sized people up like

512.13 --> 520.019
yeah is this really gonna have the

514.2 --> 522.0
effect the ideal effect that is imagined

520.019 --> 524.579
when you want to engage in those types

522.0 --> 527.3
of actions like to really know what the

524.579 --> 532.4399999999999
consequences are of your interactions

527.3 --> 534.4499999999999
yeah I'm always trying to figure that

532.44 --> 537.48
one out and I help everyone else do we

534.45 --> 539.6400000000001
do it with their lives because the world

537.48 --> 542.8100000000001
especially socially has become a lot

539.64 --> 549.329
more complicated in the last 10 years

542.81 --> 552.0889999999999
and everybody says no [ __ ] yeah but then

549.329 --> 554.87
we need a new type of skill a new type

552.089 --> 557.6400000000001
of angle to deal with all that and

554.87 --> 559.7090000000001
that's kind of what I'm trying to do

557.64 --> 563.79
also it's part of the process it just

559.709 --> 570.3499999999999
comes with that skill what I over what I

563.79 --> 574.62
do it's yeah it's very convenient mmm

570.35 --> 577.07
but anyway let's get back to actual

574.62 --> 578.899
flatter the related news or this was so

577.07 --> 584.259
hilarious

578.899 --> 588.23
this morning it popped up see

584.259 --> 594.16
an RT article I posted it in the master

588.23 --> 596.679
B chat but you just got to see this so

594.16 --> 601.009
yeah

596.679 --> 603.769
NASA exact executive in charge of

601.009 --> 607.22
artemis moon mission quits after just 60

603.769 --> 610.999
sorry six weeks escorted out of

607.22 --> 611.72
headquarters yeah so what's the story

610.999 --> 620.3290000000001
behind that

611.72 --> 623.929
right well mark Cyr say around Syria

620.329 --> 626.3
yellow orange yellow I don't know how

623.929 --> 628.3389999999999

626.3 --> 630.8499999999999
less than two months ago as special

628.339 --> 633.889
assistant to agents agency chief Jim

630.85 --> 636.589
British sign on the Artemus project has

633.889 --> 639.649
left his post after his proposal for a

636.589 --> 642.98
sustainable lunar campaign was nixed by

639.649 --> 645.17
Congress sir Angelo was escorted out of

642.98 --> 648.29
NASA headquarters in Washington after he

645.17 --> 650.0889999999999
resigned according to two sources who

648.29 --> 652.2489999999999
spoke to Reuters to pursue other

650.089 --> 655.0690000000001
opportunities to run to join the agency

652.249 --> 658.0400000000001
in April to organize a dedicated Mission

662.749 --> 669.339
moon base okay this kind of draggy first

667.04 --> 669.3389999999999
part

673.21 --> 677.77
more political stuff

686.6 --> 694.82
all right anyway it it basically broke

689.75 --> 698.35
down again there's some lot of revealing

694.82 --> 702.62
information a guy suggested like oh yeah

698.35 --> 704.8100000000001
you might have like refuted the globe

702.62 --> 709.36
using the globe model or something in

704.81 --> 709.3599999999999
their engineering it would be hilarious

712.94 --> 718.9300000000001
we need a lot more rocket scientists not

716.15 --> 718.93
fewer

723.58 --> 734.32
anyway I'm all sorry ring this up this

727.64 --> 738.23
is kind of lame about anyway yeah again

734.32 --> 746.86
surprise surprise they're slow down in

738.23 --> 759.38
nos our projects right anyway let's see

746.86 --> 762.76
again in chat and we with you yeah I am

759.38 --> 762.76
open for calls by the way

776.07 --> 793.0200000000001

777.64 --> 793.02
okay okie dokie

800.6 --> 809.1700000000001
good vibrations yeah I look I've been

804.38 --> 813.29
enjoying my day very much very much so

809.17 --> 816.86
just enjoying the Sun outside get some

813.29 --> 820.66
fresh water and some bread and then they

816.86 --> 820.66
are all chillin out in there in the heat

823.3 --> 829.25
that's doing me a lot of good I yeah my

826.52 --> 833.3
I had some update about my financial

829.25 --> 836.48
situation thing and it just seems like

833.3 --> 839.63
they yeah they for some reason just took

836.48 --> 841.49
it all like I didn't expect them to do

839.63 --> 846.67
this they didn't even say like oh there

841.49 --> 850.07
is a I say like a fine or anything

846.67 --> 852.1999999999999
although they have like suggested like

850.07 --> 854.9300000000001
oh if you don't do it then you could get

852.2 --> 857.48
it fine if they find out what that was

854.93 --> 859.7299999999999
indirect I haven't actually had a

857.48 --> 861.32
notification that I'm having a fine so

859.73 --> 867.44
they're just literally just taking you

861.32 --> 871.4000000000001
know I don't get this it's yeah it

867.44 --> 872.9300000000001
really does feel like punishment for

871.4 --> 876.05
doing work it's freaky

872.93 --> 880.16
it's not healthy and I'm gonna complain

876.05 --> 882.5899999999999
about this so but not to you guys

880.16 --> 884.92
because yeah this yeah what are you

882.59 --> 884.9200000000001
gonna do

888.96 --> 898.88
[Music]

891.02 --> 908.49
but I'm not that down about it because

898.88 --> 911.91
my dad is doing kind of good and yeah so

908.49 --> 917.19
things will be all right it's really

911.91 --> 919.14
awesome to have like family to be able

917.19 --> 924.09
to fall back on and that they're really

919.14 --> 929.61
okay with it that is just like my family

924.09 --> 932.4
set up in like after I was 12 didn't

929.61 --> 936.21
work that way at all but I was I just

932.4 --> 939.39
didn't comply I didn't really have any

936.21 --> 940.86
respect really so now I just have a

939.39 --> 944.61
really good bond with my dad and

940.86 --> 947.57
suddenly it works and like we really

944.61 --> 947.57
want to help each other out

951.27 --> 957.27
and I like I'm seriously like in my head

954.63 --> 960.8389999999999
like yeah I can't take too long I want

957.27 --> 964.5889999999999
to be able to present a son my son to

960.839 --> 967.2
him like yeah dad I I did it I finally

964.589 --> 970.98
accomplished that you basically did that

967.2 --> 972.95
through me and it's a it's gonna be all

970.98 --> 975.72
right like that I don't know just a

972.95 --> 979.4100000000001
reaffirm logos I want to reach that

975.72 --> 983.64
moment so I can I'm literally on a daily

979.41 --> 985.86
basis like yeah you know I'm okay with

983.64 --> 988.08
what I do and I like the show I like

985.86 --> 989.49
talking about all these subjects and

988.08 --> 991.62
presupposing you know all the things

989.49 --> 993.899
that I do I kind of appreciate that it's

991.62 --> 995.61
a good way to spend my time but at the

993.899 --> 998.459
same time like I don't want to be

995.61 --> 1004.2090000000001
literally doing this for twenty or

998.459 --> 1006.68
thirty years like this without

1004.209 --> 1015.8599999999999
accomplishing the other things that I

1006.68 --> 1018.26
basically must do but I yeah I have a

1015.86 --> 1021.86
view on it I have vision and I have

1018.26 --> 1024.829
trust and I have confidence and I've

1021.86 --> 1028.49
been through a lot of crazy things with

1024.829 --> 1033.079
heavy heavy obstacles almost tinker made

1028.49 --> 1035.959
for my for my how I am my talents my

1033.079 --> 1041.809
signature specifically sized up for that

1035.959 --> 1045.38
almost so I feel I have like I can do

1041.809 --> 1050.75
these things definitely to have a lot

1045.38 --> 1053.66
more confidence if anything but yeah

1050.75 --> 1056.84
it's all about initiative and financial

1053.66 --> 1059.8700000000001
room and a financial room in this age is

1056.84 --> 1063.49
kind of yeah it's not what it used to be

1059.87 --> 1063.4899999999998
like ten years ago

1067.12 --> 1072.25
[Music]

1069.25 --> 1072.25
let's

1078.33 --> 1086.58
you have I know the Omega where T I'm

1081.36 --> 1092.1599999999999
not just gonna hop on anything no of

1086.58 --> 1094.6799999999998
course not serious it's like I hate to

1092.16 --> 1097.47
get almost Owen Benjamin on it but if I

1094.68 --> 1100.5
had a woman that I'd size of like okay

1097.47 --> 1103.77
you are compatible for what I've

1100.5 --> 1107.12
envisioned for what our children could

1103.77 --> 1116.15
become I'm gonna be pretty

1107.12 --> 1120.2399999999998
medically tyrannical its but in a very

1116.15 --> 1122.4
refined way like you have like no she

1120.24 --> 1126.8700000000001
can't she has to have perfect diet

1122.4 --> 1128.0900000000001
control as she has to like really like

1126.87 --> 1130.77
she has to go to school

1128.09 --> 1133.34
basically to spare at school maybe if

1130.77 --> 1137.79
maybe she'll be already has like a like

1133.34 --> 1140.6999999999998
which which macaroons would be very

1137.79 --> 1143.1
helpful in general hey by the way thank

1140.7 --> 1146.43
you peanuts Clark for the superjet

1143.1 --> 1149.55
donation we live in a wicked world but

1146.43 --> 1153.0900000000001
yeah it has to be just this skill she

1149.55 --> 1157.44
does have she has to have the impulse

1153.09 --> 1161.3999999999999
and this skill or the ability the talent

1157.44 --> 1164.76
to to create this skill in or in order

1161.4 --> 1167.13
for it to assure that our children will

1164.76 --> 1170.04
have a good chance to have those skills

1167.13 --> 1173.6100000000001
or even have like an improved version of

1170.04 --> 1179.85
it by combining it and yeah sorry I'm

1173.61 --> 1183.27
just really super wound

1179.85 --> 1188.1
yeah well I thought my ex was really

1183.27 --> 1191.49
like that like seriously just but yeah

1188.1 --> 1196.73
she was unfortunately not willing to

1191.49 --> 1196.73
have children like really not freaky

1196.75 --> 1203.93
to Wed but there's more amazing people

1202.04 --> 1210.62
out there and and it's funny how it

1203.93 --> 1212.96
works because the way well let in this

1210.62 --> 1215.3899999999999
case the women and four males as well

1212.96 --> 1220.1200000000001
but these types of women's that are that

1215.39 --> 1224.15
amazing regular people don't notice that

1220.12 --> 1227.2099999999998
they might see the beauty or like oh

1224.15 --> 1232.25
they're really sociable but they won't

1227.21 --> 1235.43
see the refined depth that actually

1232.25 --> 1238.31
creates that because they don't have

1235.43 --> 1241.73
that that insight level they don't look

1238.31 --> 1245.8999999999999
that far I do so I recognize that and

1241.73 --> 1249.34
that's that's like one good advantage is

1245.9 --> 1252.2900000000002
they're not automatically all taken

1249.34 --> 1254.98
because some people just don't even see

1252.29 --> 1257.71
it and how special they are I see it

1254.98 --> 1265.06
this almost sounds like a pick-up line

1257.71 --> 1267.46
but it's really chewy honestly yeah

1265.06 --> 1276.08
[Music]

1267.46 --> 1280.6100000000001
right and I basically need a a partner

1276.08 --> 1283.9099999999999
in my mission as well I need them to in

1280.61 --> 1286.01
some way reflect following the path of

1283.91 --> 1287.5700000000002
Christ that doesn't happen to be exactly

1286.01 --> 1291.3799999999999
that but it has to be about the

1287.57 --> 1294.29
frequency it has to be they have to like

1291.38 --> 1296.42
synchronize like that and maybe they'll

1294.29 --> 1298.1599999999999
choose another expression because their

1296.42 --> 1300.41
character has different elements that

1298.16 --> 1303.5900000000001
just require slightly different

1300.41 --> 1305.8700000000001
frequency and I get that if it's if it

1303.59 --> 1309.3999999999999
works it works as long as it doesn't

1305.87 --> 1313.27
clash too much with my frequency but

1309.4 --> 1313.27
that's very important

1314.71 --> 1321.98
so yeah ultra demanding I'm like to me

1319.91 --> 1324.47
it almost sounds like yeah good luck

1321.98 --> 1328.82
with that but it exists I know it does

1324.47 --> 1330.3500000000001
and maybe my dad kind of weirdly but

1328.82 --> 1334.1899999999998
it's not weird if you really think about

1330.35 --> 1336.35
if you just speak it out and he would

1334.19 --> 1337.67
say like write it in a letter almost

1336.35 --> 1339.6499999999999
kind of witchy

1337.67 --> 1342.0800000000002
like write it in a letter put it to

1339.65 --> 1344.1200000000001
thought like solidify it but if I speak

1342.08 --> 1345.77
it out on a live stream it's almost kind

1344.12 --> 1349.4799999999998
of the same so I'm just gonna speak at

1345.77 --> 1353.08
it and then somewhere it might manifest

1349.48 --> 1356.03
in that form it might become set and

1353.08 --> 1359.02
attuned to me it's kind of magical

1356.03 --> 1362.3799999999999
thinking I guess but it's also just

1359.02 --> 1366.25
energetics its spirit stuff and

1362.38 --> 1369.1100000000001
intentions do definitely manifest things

1366.25 --> 1371.57
they set frequency and another thing

1369.11 --> 1373.82
start to resonate and attune and all

1371.57 --> 1377.0
that that's just it's another it's

1373.82 --> 1382.1499999999999
another way of approaching these kind of

1377.0 --> 1386.06
things without overly materializing in

1382.15 --> 1395.93
mm so but yeah who knows what's gonna

1386.06 --> 1398.09
come on my path you know what I'm not

1395.93 --> 1401.24
even looking for like a crash romance

1398.09 --> 1403.76
like yeah that's a really nice idea that

1401.24 --> 1405.98
you like walk up to something and

1403.76 --> 1412.79
suddenly just a spark start flying and

1405.98 --> 1416.09
it's like holy [ __ ] like should we that

1412.79 --> 1418.84
yeah that's cool stuff but not looking

1416.09 --> 1421.76
really for that because that usually

1418.84 --> 1425.3899999999999
eventually mutates into something that's

1421.76 --> 1428.21
not doesn't reflect the original so I've

1425.39 --> 1435.19
actually have experienced that but I

1428.21 --> 1435.19
just want I don't know

1438.43 --> 1443.2
I'm getting way too public about this

1440.68 --> 1450.79
it's just I want to take it slow that's

1443.2 --> 1454.6000000000001
just it the spirit on the long run is

1450.79 --> 1456.46
much more important to me than the

1454.6 --> 1460.75
physical really although yeah the

1456.46 --> 1465.07
physical is still important but it it's

1460.75 --> 1479.23
in priorities that remains secondary but

1465.07 --> 1482.59
I think both are important yeah yeah I

1479.23 --> 1489.059
like women so think of me whatever you

1482.59 --> 1491.59
want I like women you know I can be

1489.059 --> 1496.12
impressed by guys or have like wow

1491.59 --> 1499.87
you're really cool and like yeah being

1496.12 --> 1507.04
impressed basically but I've never been

1499.87 --> 1515.52
like Oh Yvonne you know I'm just not gay

1507.04 --> 1517.799
yeah really so

1515.52 --> 1526.71
you know I really like women but not all

1517.799 --> 1529.37
of them like women with bad attitudes I

1526.71 --> 1532.58
don't like him

1529.37 --> 1532.58
[Music]

1537.95 --> 1546.31
mm-hmm oh okay Jessica what you want to

1542.51 --> 1546.31
come on sure why not

1553.67 --> 1579.3400000000001
anyone else wants to join in yeah let me

1557.42 --> 1579.3400000000001
know on skype yeah hello hello Jessica

1580.48 --> 1592.34
well you're crackling a lot oh don't you

1584.929 --> 1597.049
too Mike okay what's my thing then I'm

1592.34 --> 1598.1299999999999
sorry oh how do I don't know yeah better

1597.049 --> 1601.07
it's it's gone

1598.13 --> 1602.96
good okay yeah it's my head I need to

1601.07 --> 1605.6299999999999
get new headphones like that was

1602.96 --> 1607.6100000000001
happening yesterday when I was on I was

1605.63 --> 1609.71
on this cord now China talked and it was

1607.61 --> 1611.84
like just everyone kept complaining

1609.71 --> 1615.799
about the mic so I need to get into me

1611.84 --> 1618.77
hair headphones which no but I was

1615.799 --> 1621.02
everything are you doing yeah I'm a bit

1618.77 --> 1625.04
flustered by the heat but I'm doing good

1621.02 --> 1632.09
overall and I'm just talking about way

1625.04 --> 1635.75
too personal stuff out in the open yeah

1632.09 --> 1637.25
I heard I heard about like I was like I

1635.75 --> 1641.75
was listening and like you know like

1637.25 --> 1642.95
about the superwoman and everything and

1641.75 --> 1644.39
like you're talking about your friend

1642.95 --> 1645.74
and everything that's really cool that

1644.39 --> 1647.5700000000002
you have like everyone needs somebody

1645.74 --> 1650.059
like that in their lives to be able to

1647.57 --> 1653.71
talk to an S that's the Hong individual

1650.059 --> 1657.49
yeah and I got several actually in

1653.71 --> 1659.39
retrospect I'm really lucky with that

1657.49 --> 1660.71
that's really good

1659.39 --> 1663.74
there's a lot of people that don't have

1660.71 --> 1666.6100000000001
that so yeah a lot of people it kind of

1663.74 --> 1669.01
breaks off at some point but no with all

1666.61 --> 1671.3899999999999
these people that I'm still

1669.01 --> 1675.14
communicating with I really have a good

1671.39 --> 1677.21
bond and there's no outlook in it

1675.14 --> 1680.2700000000002
stopping at any point it's not souring

1677.21 --> 1685.0
up or anything so even though we even

1680.27 --> 1685.0
had like pretty big conflicts

1698.19 --> 1705.77
hmm okay you know sound I don't know if

1701.52 --> 1708.36
you're on hold or anything but yeah hmm

1705.77 --> 1716.67
Doan Benjamin was a real blast this

1708.36 --> 1719.07
morning it's sometimes I get the feeling

1716.67 --> 1721.41
like that we're really in certain

1719.07 --> 1725.07
aspects just riding the same frequency

1721.41 --> 1727.8600000000001
and I get the feel that maybe the depth

1725.07 --> 1729.81
that I'm delving in that that doing that

1727.86 --> 1732.4199999999998
in general that it's kind of rubbing off

1729.81 --> 1734.94
on them or yeah uh but that's the

1732.42 --> 1737.79
correlation is not causation necessarily

1734.94 --> 1740.94
of course that they may be naturally now

1737.79 --> 1743.97
doing that as well it's kind of the time

1740.94 --> 1745.8300000000002
for it or they got a a reflection a more

1743.97 --> 1748.68
stable line with it I don't know what's

1745.83 --> 1750.48
going on but it's very impressive to see

1748.68 --> 1755.04
that I see him doing it I see others

1750.48 --> 1759.6
doing it like Alex Jones is also again

1755.04 --> 1761.01
really doing his best if you can find

1759.6 --> 1764.04
him actually in between all the

1761.01 --> 1766.47
advertisements but still the

1764.04 --> 1768.6
advertisements are also really heavy

1766.47 --> 1775.65
effort as well but of course they will

1768.6 --> 1778.55
get repetitive and yeah I keep on

1775.65 --> 1778.5500000000002
watching all of it

1783.59 --> 1793.62
come back I'm sorry right welcome back

1787.67 --> 1796.2
no no so what were you saying I was just

1793.62 --> 1798.2399999999998
talking about Owen Benjamin and and

1796.2 --> 1801.0
others like Alex Jones and how I

1798.24 --> 1804.6
basically almost feel like a correlation

1801.0 --> 1807.36
that they're trying to deep delve into

1804.6 --> 1810.09
thinking and now it almost feels like

1807.36 --> 1812.01
that's like they're getting into that

1810.09 --> 1813.78
because I've been doing it almost like I

1812.01 --> 1815.37
would be following it but it's I can

1813.78 --> 1817.8899999999999
only prove a correlation not a causation

1815.37 --> 1820.1999999999998
of course because they may be just

1817.89 --> 1823.3500000000001
naturally inclined to now start doing

1820.2 --> 1825.6000000000001
that so I can prove that they're of

1823.35 --> 1830.25
course inspired by me like they never

1825.6 --> 1833.34
even mentioned my name I think I think

1830.25 --> 1835.8
that what happens is that the people who

1833.34 --> 1840.1799999999998
you tend to be drawn to they're

1835.8 --> 1843.6299999999999
naturally like somewhat it's is like

1840.18 --> 1845.8500000000001
like on but because if you're it rubs

1843.63 --> 1848.73
off yeah and that's why it's not aware

1845.85 --> 1851.9399999999998
of it but I can't really claim oh look

1848.73 --> 1854.94
oh and Benjamin is getting Arwen traits

1851.94 --> 1857.8200000000002
I'm not gonna be that [ __ ] that makes

1854.94 --> 1860.01
everything about him but I'm gonna do

1857.82 --> 1862.59
get the impression that something like

1860.01 --> 1867.18
that because I have been doing this for

1862.59 --> 1869.07
so long now for months and I'm just

1867.18 --> 1871.98
starting to notice that other people are

1869.07 --> 1874.86
now starting to build think in the in

1871.98 --> 1877.98
similar ways like the pattern is

1874.86 --> 1882.35
starting to echo out there of sentence

1877.98 --> 1886.29
building and visualizing it's awesome

1882.35 --> 1889.2199999999998
well so maybe it is rubbing off I don't

1886.29 --> 1892.2
know maybe the algorithm is just

1889.22 --> 1894.96
extracting my elements and then just

1892.2 --> 1896.67
artificially putting that on other

1894.96 --> 1900.78
people or something I don't know how

1896.67 --> 1902.52
this is happening but and it may not

1900.78 --> 1905.55
necessarily be specific to you it just

1902.52 --> 1907.35
may be no my clunky maybe I just

1905.55 --> 1910.44
everybody picks yeah I've been to 80

1907.35 --> 1911.9099999999999
something like maybe I just get it

1910.44 --> 1914.46
naturally I'm not taking any

1911.91 --> 1915.3990000000001
instructions from AI or anything or even

1914.46 --> 1919.6490000000001
look into

1915.399 --> 1923.349
like oh like professional flowcharts um

1919.649 --> 1925.599
social dealings or anything I don't I

1923.349 --> 1928.899
know they exist but and I have a feeling

1925.599 --> 1933.399
like how they are but I don't do that it

1928.899 --> 1936.2189999999998
yeah it's not natural to me yeah you

1933.399 --> 1939.1589999999999
said flowcharts or dealing well how to

1936.219 --> 1945.519
handle social aspects in a very

1939.159 --> 1951.0990000000002
mechanical way companies do that they

1945.519 --> 1953.889
like artificially it's like how for

1951.099 --> 1955.539
example sales like how to literally it's

1953.889 --> 1957.82
not about the actual conversation

1955.539 --> 1960.729
anymore but only about getting the

1957.82 --> 1966.549
customer to a certain point so it

1960.729 --> 1974.8300000000002
literally yeah comes mechanized meta in

1966.549 --> 1976.509
a meta way absolutely ma'am no do people

1974.83 --> 1978.369
tend to do that a lot less but like

1976.509 --> 1982.349
especially I'm not gonna miss it but I

1978.369 --> 1985.869
think yeah but it's a principle method

1982.349 --> 1987.9089999999999
it's really it's a method and yeah if it

1985.869 --> 1989.9189999999999
works you start a lot of people then

1987.909 --> 1992.3200000000002
that do that especially professionally

1989.919 --> 1997.179
start to use it on anything start to use

1992.32 --> 2001.139
it on their friends yeah yeah it becomes

1997.179 --> 2006.3300000000002
them yeah like you're like oh

2001.139 --> 2008.7589999999998
incorporate yeah not always sticks they

2006.33 --> 2012.4689999999998
can be good but still they all have

2008.759 --> 2015.33
these corporate dickish nough stew them

2012.469 --> 2018.269
yeah and this isn't having installation

2015.33 --> 2019.6789999999999
like being inspired by others dancing at

2018.269 --> 2022.7
least one there's not that it's just

2019.679 --> 2026.519
that when you when it starts to become

2022.7 --> 2028.409
like you're literally just mainly

2026.519 --> 2030.929
becoming a phone or copy of something

2028.409 --> 2033.029
else something that was originally had

2030.929 --> 2035.909
authenticity this person start waiting

2033.029 --> 2038.279
for this person ever all type of thing

2035.909 --> 2040.739
going on and then but then like now

2038.279 --> 2043.589
everyone's then everybody just start to

2040.739 --> 2045.539
get lumped up into one category and then

2043.589 --> 2047.279
it starts to become a bit right it's no

2045.539 --> 2049.11
I think it's the thing with Owen really

2047.279 --> 2051.72
likes to be categorized you

2049.11 --> 2054.21
and that's under sample but at the same

2051.72 --> 2057.1499999999996
time we do want to be a part of a group

2054.21 --> 2062.16
it's weird yeah but we are all

2057.15 --> 2064.38
individuals yes we are yes yes and that

2062.16 --> 2065.97
but we're both we're a groups and we're

2064.38 --> 2068.85
individuals but if you take the

2065.97 --> 2070.95
individual factor out of it then you

2068.85 --> 2072.81
take away the individual spirit of these

2070.95 --> 2076.35
people you take away their sovereignty

2072.81 --> 2080.07
and that's what the corporate Marxist

2076.35 --> 2087.48
system is trying to do take away your

2080.07 --> 2089.31
individuality 1984 right and they're

2087.48 --> 2091.98
like that's what it that way it is it's

2089.31 --> 2093.18
much easier to when you have when you

2091.98 --> 2094.62
have people that are grouped up like

2093.18 --> 2097.14
that it's much easier to then you have

2094.62 --> 2099.0299999999997
people in the huddle and everything it's

2097.14 --> 2100.7999999999997
much easier to influence that whole

2099.03 --> 2104.4300000000003
group versus everyone just having their

2100.8 --> 2106.8
own mentality and everything so that's

2104.43 --> 2109.1
why it's like we you are you are but you

2106.8 --> 2111.78
still have your own individual

2109.1 --> 2118.14
individual understanding of things it's

2111.78 --> 2120.9900000000002
you know I'm saying so yeah right well

2118.14 --> 2123.6
you could compare it like this if

2120.99 --> 2126.4199999999996
everyone as an individual was just Lord

2123.6 --> 2129.45
of their own person like their body was

2126.42 --> 2131.91
their castle and that way yeah then

2129.45 --> 2135.0299999999997
there can be a communication between oh

2131.91 --> 2136.71
yeah it's just a real it's actual

2135.03 --> 2138.92
sovereignty that's what the original

2136.71 --> 2141.7200000000003
idea of personal sovereignty even was

2138.92 --> 2145.92
it's taking away that unique right from

2141.72 --> 2148.1099999999997
the nobility to be yeah untouchable in

2145.92 --> 2149.58
their rights because of the nobility had

2148.11 --> 2151.2000000000003
the rights and they could just point at

2149.58 --> 2154.02
people that were Noble and just make

2151.2 --> 2164.5499999999997
them their slaves to take that away and

2154.02 --> 2168.03
make it give it to a citizenship to be

2164.55 --> 2170.9700000000003
sovereign is to be like a noble but the

2168.03 --> 2173.0400000000004
original nobles weren't all just maniacs

2170.97 --> 2175.3199999999997
they had a very strict code of conduct

2173.04 --> 2177.21
and it could end up in duels if they

2175.32 --> 2178.98
misbehaves and then they got rid of the

2177.21 --> 2181.2
duels Oh guess who did that oh what's

2178.98 --> 2182.46
the French Court right before the

2181.2 --> 2185.64
Jacobite

2182.46 --> 2188.9
jacobeans over what is it the French

2185.64 --> 2190.3089999999997
Revolution so the Liberals basically

2188.9 --> 2192.4500000000003
yeah

2190.309 --> 2194.1600000000003
liberals took away the guns for the

2192.45 --> 2202.68
nobility and guess what happened to the

2194.16 --> 2205.5
nobility and so I had no no hmm it's

2202.68 --> 2208.0789999999997
like it's like a trick like this was

2205.5 --> 2210.18
like the trix's basically it's like a

2208.079 --> 2212.88
whole they're really really really

2210.18 --> 2215.16
clever that's why you have to be but

2212.88 --> 2219.839
they're methodical and they guide the

2215.16 --> 2221.46
method right that's why you have to be

2219.839 --> 2224.869
careful like you can't just be like oh

2221.46 --> 2227.309
no they're definitely not your friends

2224.869 --> 2230.4900000000002
like no like people will have their own

2227.309 --> 2233.0400000000004
silent agenda their own type of way they

2230.49 --> 2234.359
want things to be they're not don't

2233.04 --> 2235.829
think that they're putting you in the

2234.359 --> 2237.839
forefront they're actually really caring

2235.829 --> 2240.809
about you know if you're not if you're

2237.839 --> 2242.069
not pushing their agenda for did they're

2240.809 --> 2243.599
just gonna you know I'm saying like

2242.069 --> 2246.27
their whole thing is to control but

2243.599 --> 2248.28
they're doing it in a way that's you

2246.27 --> 2251.22
know I'm saying that provide that that

2248.28 --> 2253.77
makes it look as if it's comforting it's

2251.22 --> 2256.2599999999998
accepting its blah blah blah you know

2253.77 --> 2258.329
it's like oh like everyone is equal

2256.26 --> 2260.8190000000004
equality they're making it appear that

2258.329 --> 2266.2200000000003
way mm-hm and it's really not and it's

2260.819 --> 2268.319
really not that there's no like because

2266.22 --> 2271.339
like they put down that one gets the

2268.319 --> 2275.75
opportunity to become equal slaves

2271.339 --> 2278.16
exactly exactly

2275.75 --> 2281.22
yep doesn't know what they don't they

2278.16 --> 2282.66
don't want to die but they want that you

2281.22 --> 2284.25
know I'm saying so people have to think

2282.66 --> 2285.93
about it that way instead of it it

2284.25 --> 2287.94
doesn't have to be this oh my god

2285.93 --> 2291.0299999999997
these der so it doesn't have to be that

2287.94 --> 2294.78
extreme it's very it's really really

2291.03 --> 2297.8390000000004
simple when you think about how how

2294.78 --> 2299.28
power works its period once you

2297.839 --> 2303.599
understand that then you understand how

2299.28 --> 2306.6600000000003
these individuals how these individuals

2303.599 --> 2309.319
influence and affect the masses the way

2306.66 --> 2312.7799999999997
that they do what their motivation is I

2309.319 --> 2314.19
know that so right well it's usually not

2312.78 --> 2319.17
the narrator

2314.19 --> 2320.79
if that they're putting out right and

2319.17 --> 2324.15
they say one thing but they think I'm

2320.79 --> 2326.37
living and with governments this is even

2324.15 --> 2329.4300000000003
true like general what governments put

2326.37 --> 2331.5
out their narratives but that's why

2329.43 --> 2334.5299999999997
there are so many speculators as to size

2331.5 --> 2336.3
up how the game is played like what does

2334.53 --> 2338.07
it actually mean is this a bluff what

2336.3 --> 2340.71
they're doing right now or this - are

2338.07 --> 2343.71
they negotiating some trade system

2340.71 --> 2345.36
through for trying to be imposing or

2343.71 --> 2347.34
whatever or are they trying to make

2345.36 --> 2350.9100000000003
friends in a certain type of financial

2347.34 --> 2354.21
stroke like it's never just straight

2350.91 --> 2356.49
word for word what they say never market

2354.21 --> 2359.31
never has been really for a long long

2356.49 --> 2361.35
time and that's why they're all these

2359.31 --> 2364.65
speculators to basically figure out what

2361.35 --> 2366.69
that action really signifies what the

2364.65 --> 2371.34
narrative signifies instead of taking it

2366.69 --> 2374.81
literal and those who understand

2371.34 --> 2374.81
politics take this is second nature

2376.43 --> 2382.5899999999997
really you know it's somewhat

2380.28 --> 2384.96
metaphysical way as well when it comes

2382.59 --> 2387.7200000000003
to things it's like you have that like

2384.96 --> 2392.19
you have one it's like they provide that

2387.72 --> 2393.6
other aspect that other energy like you

2392.19 --> 2395.94
have like you have then you have the

2393.6 --> 2398.88
Liberals and then you have conservatives

2395.94 --> 2401.34
it's like it's like you have this energy

2398.88 --> 2404.04
going back and forth back and forth it's

2401.34 --> 2405.8700000000003
like this this um this conflict between

2404.04 --> 2407.7
energy is going but it's like a it's

2405.87 --> 2409.43
like a chain it's like they in a way

2407.7 --> 2411.7799999999997
they kind of play off of each other

2409.43 --> 2414.72
basically it's like like that back and

2411.78 --> 2416.2200000000003
forth that it's like so that's the way I

2414.72 --> 2421.2
look at it I look at it in that sense

2416.22 --> 2423.0299999999997
you know I'm saying like again yeah and

2421.2 --> 2425.1299999999997
then I know it goes deeper than that but

2423.03 --> 2427.92
that's just what they're both pushing it

2425.13 --> 2429.87
they're brushing it in a position to one

2427.92 --> 2432.02
another and that's really their problem

2429.87 --> 2433.89
is that they keep on pushing one another

2432.02 --> 2436.86
that's the real problem

2433.89 --> 2440.0299999999997
it's not really their principles it's

2436.86 --> 2444.3900000000003
that they keep on pushing it too far

2440.03 --> 2446.1000000000004
we're looking on like oh how can we can

2444.39 --> 2446.93
we like poke them a little and then can

2446.1 --> 2450.0499999999997
poke a little

2446.93 --> 2452.6299999999997
more and how can we assault them in a

2450.05 --> 2454.2200000000003
way that they that things don't go out

2452.63 --> 2456.4100000000003
of control and they're always like

2454.22 --> 2461.859
trying to push one another through media

2456.41 --> 2461.859
through financial things and schools

2462.19 --> 2469.91
business everywhere political influences

2466.66 --> 2473.8689999999997
poking one another try

2469.91 --> 2476.7799999999997
yeah it was like the more like the more

2473.869 --> 2478.2200000000003
on when you have when you have a more of

2476.78 --> 2480.559
a conservative agenda that's being

2478.22 --> 2482.93
pushed out there that's dominating then

2480.559 --> 2485.63
that's when the liberal attacks to go

2482.93 --> 2489.02
even more extreme and fight back against

2485.63 --> 2490.579
that so it's like yeah yeah but that's

2489.02 --> 2493.0099999999998
really their problem it's like an

2490.579 --> 2495.9700000000003
objective to the extreme left to be

2493.01 --> 2500.69
extreme and that's just ridiculous

2495.97 --> 2503.77
it's like their their system is broken

2500.69 --> 2507.9500000000003
their objective system like the rules

2503.77 --> 2510.68
it's broken it's like an error in the

2507.95 --> 2515.1499999999996
system and they're not correcting it and

2510.68 --> 2516.6189999999997
it's totally absurd all right I think

2515.15 --> 2518.809
there's a lot like I don't think they're

2516.619 --> 2519.71
necessarily right and that's what and

2518.809 --> 2522.98
that's one thing I've always been

2519.71 --> 2524.75
curious of like is it that is it broken

2522.98 --> 2527.48
in terms of like how it's affecting the

2524.75 --> 2530.21
people or the broken in terms of how it

2527.48 --> 2532.22
like well cuz I can explain exactly how

2530.21 --> 2534.349
it's broken the system the liberal

2532.22 --> 2540.47
system with that party system and that

2534.349 --> 2542.299
group and the media system it's alex

2540.47 --> 2546.319
jones gonna love this one but it's like

2542.299 --> 2548.93
yeah a great guy a liberal or an

2546.319 --> 2552.89
astronaut or something yeah natural rock

2548.93 --> 2557.4199999999996
in space in a movie and then like an

2552.89 --> 2559.43
alien pops out like in the movie alien

2557.42 --> 2562.4
and like the new Liberal Party is that

2559.43 --> 2566.27
alien like yeah it is surrounded by that

2562.4 --> 2570.23
body it but it nested in it and it

2566.27 --> 2572.48
literally abandoned everything that was

2570.23 --> 2576.02
wholesome about the original concepts

2572.48 --> 2579.42
and just like a like a monster spawned

2576.02 --> 2581.579
forth from it and then keeping up the

2579.42 --> 2584.73
that corpse skinned off the original

2581.579 --> 2586.5
liberal guy to portray yeah I'm still

2584.73 --> 2588.93
liberal but it's actually a freaking

2586.5 --> 2593.579
alien that killed the original liberal

2588.93 --> 2595.8289999999997
guy that's really kind of oh that's

2593.579 --> 2598.4700000000003
enough doesn't really really good enough

2595.829 --> 2604.619
I'm now yeah it's gonna love that one

2598.47 --> 2617.3089999999997
but it's it's an alien in human liberal

2604.619 --> 2619.4700000000003
skin clothing ya know this alright but

2617.309 --> 2621.78
they really they're like aliens in the

2619.47 --> 2624.39
movie alien you know the hell sorry they

2621.78 --> 2627.809
grow so eventually yeah alien kind of

2624.39 --> 2632.9
bursts out of the original skin and so

2627.809 --> 2636.299
it's like yeah I'm still see like the

2632.9 --> 2641.01
the mobile mouth and everything already

2636.299 --> 2643.29
going up and forth and like no I think

2641.01 --> 2648.42
you're not that liberal guy anymore

2643.29 --> 2650.52
alien yeah are you sure that despite

2648.42 --> 2652.619
you're trying to behave kind of normal

2650.52 --> 2653.579
which is weird for an alien they never

2652.619 --> 2657.0
normally wouldn't do that

2653.579 --> 2660.42
pretty sure you're actually in yea

2657.0 --> 2665.579
pretty large alien wearing the remnants

2660.42 --> 2667.589
of a human liberal skin mmm-hmm maybe

2665.579 --> 2670.79
you should come over with me to the

2667.589 --> 2680.88
airlock just take a look at the window

2670.79 --> 2682.97
be right back yeah nothing to worry

2680.88 --> 2687.21
about

2682.97 --> 2690.6299999999997
yeah there's yeah it makes lesson and

2687.21 --> 2692.13
this just so is you just really really

2690.63 --> 2695.79
messed up like everything that's going

2692.13 --> 2697.4700000000003
on right now like like this oh and I'm

2695.79 --> 2699.69
not in like what's crazy is like you

2697.47 --> 2700.9199999999996
know you know not everybody who is one

2699.69 --> 2702.9
thing I will say is another not

2700.92 --> 2705.559
everybody who is on the left or

2702.9 --> 2709.23
necessarily liberal is has an extraneous

2705.559 --> 2712.079
mind agenda it's just the political you

2709.23 --> 2713.369
know I'm so where can you go that's it

2712.079 --> 2715.4100000000003
yeah and

2713.369 --> 2717.239
they get seduced by power because it's

2715.41 --> 2720.299
constantly shoved in their face

2717.239 --> 2722.339
that's reduction from all angles so they

2720.299 --> 2725.309
then just like okay that Liberal Party

2722.339 --> 2727.229
is freakin corrupt but yeah otherwise

2725.309 --> 2730.289
I'm gonna literally be completely

2727.229 --> 2731.7889999999998
nowhere the right will day because

2730.289 --> 2734.849
always says like the right it's not

2731.789 --> 2738.5690000000004
gonna accept you you know it's not

2734.849 --> 2740.789
totally not true but yeah a lot of

2738.569 --> 2743.19
people that are naturally liberal world

2740.789 --> 2750.1800000000003
then just risk going with it and it'll

2743.19 --> 2751.829
tear them apart over time yep does you

2750.18 --> 2754.0789999999997
think that you think you have some type

2751.829 --> 2758.1600000000003
of friendships and properly yeah you

2754.079 --> 2761.94
don't mean here it's not no let's no you

2758.16 --> 2762.42
have like people that yeah it's just

2761.94 --> 2764.19
creepy

2762.42 --> 2765.71
it is ninety eighty four people that

2764.19 --> 2767.279
constantly check each other for

2765.71 --> 2769.529
microaggressions and that kind of

2767.279 --> 2772.619
nonsense it's not that bad everywhere

2769.529 --> 2777.45
but there with some circles if you want

2772.619 --> 2781.259
to be part then you have to do that they

2777.45 --> 2783.299
do exist and it's just kind of

2781.259 --> 2785.19
normalized I don't know it's like okay

2783.299 --> 2785.88
to do that you can't really complain

2785.19 --> 2787.589
about it

2785.88 --> 2790.099
nothing's gonna be done about it if you

2787.589 --> 2795.299
complain about that kind of situation

2790.099 --> 2797.819
social situation Oh mister I feel like

2795.299 --> 2799.95
if there are no people if enough of the

2797.819 --> 2801.8089999999997
masses are able to speak out against it

2799.95 --> 2803.91
and expose that they would be forced to

2801.809 --> 2805.739
change their policies but if there's a

2803.91 --> 2807.0589999999997
lot of people are being fed a certain

2805.739 --> 2807.7490000000003
narrative and don't really know what's

2807.059 --> 2810.779
going on

2807.749 --> 2812.729
oblivious there's not gonna be a lot you

2810.779 --> 2815.479
know you have a few people you know I'm

2812.729 --> 2817.6499999999996
saying like it's like oh you like oh

2815.479 --> 2819.66
you're trying to think of the I can't

2817.65 --> 2822.119
think of the word right now but you know

2819.66 --> 2823.739
a few people who are looking at what's

2822.119 --> 2826.079
going on and everything like that

2823.739 --> 2828.2690000000002
they're the ones and they're the ones

2826.079 --> 2829.4990000000003
who get attacked by the in the droves by

2828.269 --> 2831.749
the ones who think that everything is

2829.499 --> 2834.479
all hunky-dory and all that so it's like

2831.749 --> 2837.0589999999997
you like you try to speak out but it's

2834.479 --> 2837.499
in that sense quantity does really

2837.059 --> 2839.849
matter

2837.499 --> 2842.8799999999997
quality matters as well but a quantity

2839.849 --> 2846.81
rule wait it's like because this is the

2842.88 --> 2848.4
people as the people stop accepting and

2846.81 --> 2850.17
dealing with like these policies and

2848.4 --> 2851.64
dealing with what's going on then they

2850.17 --> 2854.04
will be forced to change the narrative

2851.64 --> 2857.52
look right balance right peer pressure

2854.04 --> 2861.41
basically yeah but doesn't necessarily

2857.52 --> 2864.45
have to be because it all depends on how

2861.41 --> 2867.18
how ambitious these people that keep

2864.45 --> 2869.64
this in place are and I think they are

2867.18 --> 2871.98
like pretty insanely ambitious to keep

2869.64 --> 2876.75
it the way that it is now especially in

2871.98 --> 2878.61
America like these professors and a lot

2876.75 --> 2881.27
of these people that just forward this

2878.61 --> 2885.42
kind of thinking they are fanatics like

2881.27 --> 2887.1
in person they act fanatical and it get

2885.42 --> 2894.9
really aggressive at times it's just

2887.1 --> 2900.72
freaky so yeah it's gonna be I don't

2894.9 --> 2903.03
know it some point they're literally

2900.72 --> 2906.2999999999997
probably just gonna be dragged out of

2903.03 --> 2909.57
their jobs or other their places like

2906.3 --> 2911.2200000000003
yeah okay there's no longer a support

2909.57 --> 2913.0800000000004
structure for what you're trying to do

2911.22 --> 2916.47
here nobody wants it all the parents

2913.08 --> 2918.45
have complained about it we have been

2916.47 --> 2919.98
allowed to now adopt a new type of

2918.45 --> 2922.4399999999996
curriculum that's actually more

2919.98 --> 2924.66
marketable and adapted to the new age

2922.44 --> 2928.08
instead of this insane nonsan that just

2924.66 --> 2933.69
helps everybody to giant pile of college

2928.08 --> 2936.21
debt so goodbye here out of a job then

2933.69 --> 2938.9900000000002
if they then get injustice then they're

2936.21 --> 2941.58
just gonna get dragged off by the police

2938.99 --> 2944.1
the idiot eventually there's definitely

2941.58 --> 2946.56
gonna happen certainly but it's just a

2944.1 --> 2950.43
couple of years probably maybe a decade

2946.56 --> 2953.84
and it's gonna be over and there's going

2950.43 --> 2953.8399999999997
to be new problems instead of that

2956.46 --> 2969.91
remember do you are you still there by

2959.05 --> 2974.2000000000003
the way Jessie Jessie hmm I'm not

2969.91 --> 2977.3199999999997
getting any sound from you but does

2974.2 --> 2979.24
everybody else remember the time when

2977.32 --> 2984.19
for the first time

2979.24 --> 2986.41
social justice became a thing like it it

2984.19 --> 2989.23
really popped into the media during the

2986.41 --> 2993.8199999999997
Obama era especially the first term

2989.23 --> 2996.25
remember how like a rage it was to do

2993.82 --> 2999.1600000000003
that kind of thing to adapt to proper

2996.25 --> 3000.99
lingo it was really everybody was like

2999.16 --> 3002.7599999999998
oh this is all the rage this is going to

3000.99 --> 3005.22
change everything was a total hype and

3002.76 --> 3007.44
it was being hyped to the max like

3005.22 --> 3010.4599999999996
massive investments in that hype it was

3007.44 --> 3013.02
like a corporate cultural program

3010.46 --> 3015.96
terrible I've been it's one of the most

3013.02 --> 3019.32
painful things they ever did I hated it

3015.96 --> 3022.41
I realized it pretty early on I just

3019.32 --> 3024.21
thought like we just need to just not

3022.41 --> 3027.3599999999997
give it any attention but it didn't work

3024.21 --> 3030.75
it's just too massive and investment but

3027.36 --> 3034.6800000000003
yeah for all that hype that propelled it

3030.75 --> 3038.97
at first now people in general are

3034.68 --> 3041.85
pretty sick of it and this is hardened

3038.97 --> 3043.98
the people that have actually latched on

3041.85 --> 3047.3399999999997
to it in a one way decision kind of

3043.98 --> 3049.38
thing and they're getting like desperate

3047.34 --> 3051.81
and more aggressive and you get to

3049.38 --> 3054.69
notice that that's where these weird old

3051.81 --> 3058.77
videos of like these for example

3054.69 --> 3061.79
transsexual people that get miss names

3058.77 --> 3065.45
and then go totally berserk and go on a

3061.79 --> 3069.27
vandalism rage in that kind of [ __ ]

3065.45 --> 3072.0
that's because it's not as popular like

3069.27 --> 3078.81
these people would be like open-armed

3072.0 --> 3083.19
welcomed eight years ago right remember

3078.81 --> 3085.14
that remember back then what happened

3083.19 --> 3089.37
the actual energy what was unleashed

3085.14 --> 3090.06
that's now all died out even though it'd

3089.37 --> 3093.12
still be

3090.06 --> 3095.5499999999997
kind of reinforced with words the

3093.12 --> 3099.33
momentum has died out and the rage is

3095.55 --> 3099.78
absolutely gone and most people are sick

3099.33 --> 3103.0099999999998
of it

3099.78 --> 3106.32
so that's never gonna get back and

3103.01 --> 3108.69
because of that there's never gonna be a

3106.32 --> 3111.15
return of that [ __ ] at least in the

3108.69 --> 3113.01
Western world for a while because it

3111.15 --> 3115.71
they totally spread it everywhere in

3113.01 --> 3118.5
everybody's face and now it's it's gonna

3115.71 --> 3121.05
just slowly die out and we're gonna move

3118.5 --> 3124.74
on to a more productive type of culture

3121.05 --> 3126.84
and I'm probably very self created now

3124.74 --> 3129.6
with the internet people are everywhere

3126.84 --> 3133.4700000000003
engaging in trying to build some kind of

3129.6 --> 3137.31
own culture some kind of own way of

3133.47 --> 3139.02
doing things of just some sometimes I

3137.31 --> 3141.12
just keep on zapping in YouTube to

3139.02 --> 3143.67
deadly different type of channels and

3141.12 --> 3152.79
I'm just noticing that people are trying

3143.67 --> 3159.9
to build their own type of thing really

3152.79 --> 3166.8
working on it so yeah the old

3159.9 --> 3168.87
hierarchies are gonna go away as usual

3166.8 --> 3171.6000000000004
and this hierarchy that was going to be

3168.87 --> 3173.43
a ruler class supposedly as Alex Jones

3171.6 --> 3177.69
suggests and it's very true really

3173.43 --> 3182.85
that's really what they were told they

3177.69 --> 3185.33
told me when they try to get me and yeah

3182.85 --> 3188.33
this is just not gonna happen

3185.33 --> 3188.33
like

3189.14 --> 3193.91
it couldn't happen and if it did happen

3191.63 --> 3195.71
it was very unlikely it would happen as

3193.91 --> 3198.77
the people that have been told it would

3195.71 --> 3203.45
happen would imagine it to become so

3198.77 --> 3207.35
it's just total foolishness to continue

3203.45 --> 3209.27
trying to push this well yeah if you

3207.35 --> 3212.69
invested everything if you sacrifice so

3209.27 --> 3214.64
much then where's what is there to go

3212.69 --> 3216.35
back to that's the angle of a lot of

3214.64 --> 3222.44
people that just dove in way too deep

3216.35 --> 3226.04
and they're literally screwed although

3222.44 --> 3231.9500000000003
yeah they might just literally be

3226.04 --> 3237.68
slapped in the face with it and find ya

3231.95 --> 3241.04
a new a new starting point to become

3237.68 --> 3243.77
whatever they have made themselves and

3241.04 --> 3248.42
still be a pretty incredible individual

3243.77 --> 3251.75
but not with the presupposed things that

3248.42 --> 3254.75
were supposed to come so who knows I

3251.75 --> 3257.12
don't know but it's gonna end the whole

3254.75 --> 3261.41
social justice warrior nonsense it's

3257.12 --> 3264.17
gonna be just eventually it'll probably

3261.41 --> 3266.33
just be like the communist scum that

3264.17 --> 3268.2200000000003
there'll be the approach because they're

3266.33 --> 3269.75
probably always will be these types of

3268.22 --> 3271.31
people there always have been

3269.75 --> 3273.32
it's just that people didn't really

3271.31 --> 3279.23
recognize them at certain ages because

3273.32 --> 3281.78
they wasn't so much attention to it kind

3279.23 --> 3285.53
of it kept in the background but there

3281.78 --> 3288.1400000000003
will always be these types but yeah that

3285.53 --> 3290.9300000000003
idea that they're gonna rule that's just

3288.14 --> 3294.6099999999997
over and lost the strength they lost the

3290.93 --> 3294.6099999999997
momentum it's gone

3296.42 --> 3308.839
thank God literally sorry

3305.89 --> 3312.319
welcome back uh yeah I'm sorry I had to

3308.839 --> 3312.859
take care of sister well like I was I

3312.319 --> 3316.18
missed

3312.859 --> 3318.41
I know I missed a whole bunch of stuff

3316.18 --> 3328.7599999999998
but you know I'll be able to look back

3318.41 --> 3331.49
on the show so yeah we talked about I

3328.76 --> 3335.0
was just ranting on how the social

3331.49 --> 3337.279
justice warrior situation happened

3335.0 --> 3339.5
during the Obama age that it became like

3337.279 --> 3341.869
a serious hype and everyone was always

3339.5 --> 3344.839
trying fool around with it like it's

3341.869 --> 3347.079
worse than latest toy and how that

3344.839 --> 3350.119
momentum is just gone it was really

3347.079 --> 3352.2690000000002
enforced by the media and now like

3350.119 --> 3355.069
everybody's pretty much sick of it and

3352.269 --> 3357.019
that's reflecting again itself through

3355.069 --> 3359.869
people that have sacrificed so much for

3357.019 --> 3362.9599999999996
it that are going nuts because they're

3359.869 --> 3369.17
obviously not getting what they were

3362.96 --> 3370.7
promised right exactly that's what I

3369.17 --> 3374.119
think that's the biggest reason why

3370.7 --> 3376.21
there's such a such a big wave now I

3374.119 --> 3378.92
think he's just going all over the place

3376.21 --> 3381.95
because it was this big hole that was

3378.92 --> 3386.029
splitting into people's head like people

3381.95 --> 3388.46
are like people can be only people can

3386.029 --> 3390.019
be fooled on with this along but there's

3388.46 --> 3391.2200000000003
only so much that you can put people

3390.019 --> 3394.819
through before they're just like you

3391.22 --> 3397.509
know what this is enough all right but

3394.819 --> 3401.18
it all depends that okay look as many

3397.509 --> 3403.819
more sensible people they can be fooled

3401.18 --> 3406.5389999999998
by their leader or whatever and then at

3403.819 --> 3410.93
some point they'll have enough and

3406.539 --> 3414.6800000000003
they'll then reject but the problem is

3410.93 --> 3417.98
with the ante for people yeah the more

3414.68 --> 3419.839
extreme communist types is that nothing

3417.98 --> 3424.39
is enough for them they'll go more crazy

3419.839 --> 3427.67
but they'll never reject their

3424.39 --> 3428.8689999999997
hostage-taker it's it's literally their

3427.67 --> 3439.339
religion to be

3428.869 --> 3440.779
on that side really that's true and

3439.339 --> 3442.73
that's why I say there's good just gonna

3440.779 --> 3445.849
be people that are always gonna be on

3442.73 --> 3448.19
that side but all the power that they

3445.849 --> 3450.9990000000003
were promised and the media assistants

3448.19 --> 3454.21
and all that well all that machinery is

3450.999 --> 3457.009
dying out it's not functioning it's not

3454.21 --> 3460.9990000000003
growing it's not winning the spells

3457.009 --> 3463.759
wearing off the hype is gone and I was

3460.999 --> 3466.0989999999997
just gonna wither wither wait there's no

3463.759 --> 3469.999
way that that that the whole situation

3466.099 --> 3472.1600000000003
could get a second momentum you know

3469.999 --> 3474.4399999999996
this right they know this you can feel

3472.16 --> 3476.769
it just figure out like what if they

3474.44 --> 3479.809
would redo it would that really work

3476.769 --> 3483.819
would that change people's minds make

3479.809 --> 3486.92
them switch to being Pro that again no

3483.819 --> 3489.17
not a mark this is not what in general

3486.92 --> 3492.9500000000003
like the people that went to that side

3489.17 --> 3495.049
they went to that side well but there's

3492.95 --> 3496.91
at the same time an entire alternative

3495.049 --> 3500.859
media narrative all over the place

3496.91 --> 3503.8089999999997
that's just very aware that yeah that is

3500.859 --> 3505.339
not what we want and people that are on

3503.809 --> 3511.279
that side that have seen these things

3505.339 --> 3513.859
are not gonna go back so it doesn't

3511.279 --> 3516.289
really matter how much new attention and

3513.859 --> 3518.859
momentum they are going to be given by

3516.289 --> 3522.0190000000002
media or government or whatever finance

3518.859 --> 3524.799
it's not gonna work anymore people

3522.019 --> 3524.799
figured it out

3529.47 --> 3536.37
so that's just my opinion I don't know

3532.05 --> 3538.4700000000003
maybe you know you could go a dark route

3536.37 --> 3541.74
and say that eventually did they'll just

3538.47 --> 3544.89
force it upon everyone like yeah okay we

3541.74 --> 3548.25
are absolutely one tyrannical system and

3544.89 --> 3552.5899999999997
now everybody has to get a sex change

3548.25 --> 3554.97
that kind of freaking insanity something

3552.59 --> 3557.3900000000003
but if that kind of [ __ ] starts to

3554.97 --> 3560.1899999999996
happen then everything is totally flux

3557.39 --> 3562.2599999999998
it is so funny that you mentioned it was

3560.19 --> 3564.36
not funny but is it it's interesting

3562.26 --> 3567.7200000000003
that you mention that because like this

3564.36 --> 3569.34
morning I was like hey I was looking I

3567.72 --> 3572.1899999999996
was on own I got a notification from

3569.34 --> 3574.4100000000003
organization and it was coffee on the

3572.19 --> 3576.66
gender-bender agenda and everything so I

3574.41 --> 3578.85
just started watching that this one and

3576.66 --> 3580.5899999999997
it was so create all the stuff that they

3578.85 --> 3584.0
were talking about Isabelle said it's so

3580.59 --> 3587.1600000000003
crazy like basically like literally

3584.0 --> 3590.01
programming and brainwashing people and

3587.16 --> 3591.93
parents and children into thinking that

3590.01 --> 3594.1800000000003
there's something wrong with the way

3591.93 --> 3597.06
they were born and it's like people know

3594.18 --> 3599.22
like nobody sees the psychological

3597.06 --> 3601.0499999999997
damage I'm not gonna say that nobody

3599.22 --> 3602.8799999999997
sees it but like the fact that they're

3601.05 --> 3603.8700000000003
pushing that so harshly let people

3602.88 --> 3605.9700000000003
really need to see that there's

3603.87 --> 3607.83
something wrong with this if you don't

3605.97 --> 3609.93
allow it [ __ ] like before the child has

3607.83 --> 3612.06
even fully developed they should not be

3609.93 --> 3613.68
making those kinds of decisions about

3612.06 --> 3615.42
whether or not they want to be a boy or

3613.68 --> 3617.8199999999997
a girl or anything like that like it's

3615.42 --> 3619.25
like no like you have to also say like

3617.82 --> 3623.1000000000004
children that they don't know anymore

3619.25 --> 3624.87
it's like they're exactly it's abuse

3623.1 --> 3626.4
it's a that's exactly what it is cuz

3624.87 --> 3627.6
like children they say all types of

3626.4 --> 3629.85
stuff they said they want to be this is

3627.6 --> 3631.7999999999997
a little event as they're growing up as

3629.85 --> 3634.44
they get older children play dress up

3631.8 --> 3636.3900000000003
like this because you see a boy dressing

3634.44 --> 3637.8
up as a girl wearing one of mommy's hats

3636.39 --> 3639.18
there's not all of a sudden mean you

3637.8 --> 3642.9
have to make him go through this

3639.18 --> 3646.41
hormonal transition and it's totally

3642.9 --> 3648.06
insane you know I'm saying like it's

3646.41 --> 3649.2599999999998
like that's my whole thing is like you

3648.06 --> 3651.33
can do whatever you want to do whatever

3649.26 --> 3654.8100000000004
you want to be like way in terms of the

3651.33 --> 3657.39
social construction of the way that of

3654.81 --> 3659.07
the way that um everything is portrayed

3657.39 --> 3660.2999999999997
like if you're a man you have to be this

3659.07 --> 3662.4
way if you're a woman you have to be

3660.3 --> 3663.15
that way that is something that is true

3662.4 --> 3667.65
and that isn't

3663.15 --> 3670.23
parcel mentality but to then say that to

3667.65 --> 3672.39
then say that you can just become a

3670.23 --> 3674.88
woman and you can just become a man no

3672.39 --> 3678.54
that's not well this you can imagine

3674.88 --> 3681.0
that no you can role play that and go

3678.54 --> 3684.11
very far with it it might work or it

3681.0 --> 3689.16
might not work but my main issue is that

3684.11 --> 3690.9300000000003
yeah when you ask non adults about this

3689.16 --> 3693.45
like hey would you like to be of the

3690.93 --> 3697.3799999999997
opposite sex suggesting that that could

3693.45 --> 3698.97
actually be real then who knows maybe

3697.38 --> 3701.6400000000003
whatever the face they're going through

3698.97 --> 3702.6899999999996
it could be like yeah sure especially if

3701.64 --> 3704.6099999999997
they're a little like oh yeah like

3702.69 --> 3707.34
playing a girl I want to be a girl

3704.61 --> 3710.52
forever you know it's like little kids

3707.34 --> 3713.25
can be like that and they don't see the

3710.52 --> 3716.34
long-term consequences so to suggest

3713.25 --> 3719.43
that that could be a ground for actual

3716.34 --> 3726.33
radical decision for something like that

3719.43 --> 3728.5499999999997
is absolutely maniacal right and so it's

3726.33 --> 3730.83
really it's really really crazy and like

3728.55 --> 3733.17
people need to more and more people need

3730.83 --> 3734.79
to speak out about the like that's the

3733.17 --> 3737.01
whole thing it's like you have so many

3734.79 --> 3738.59
people they're not showing the nay

3737.01 --> 3740.6400000000003
they're trying to show this positive

3738.59 --> 3742.6800000000003
aspect of it or trying to make it seem

3740.64 --> 3744.6
like it's a good thing and that these

3742.68 --> 3746.8199999999997
people are happy when there's a lot of

3744.6 --> 3749.97
them that when there's a lot of them

3746.82 --> 3752.1600000000003
that do regret making like making those

3749.97 --> 3754.4399999999996
decisions especially at a young age like

3752.16 --> 3755.97
when they're before they were even able

3754.44 --> 3759.18
to even knew what they were going to be

3755.97 --> 3761.8799999999997
yeah before they learn how their

3759.18 --> 3764.6099999999997
character would change because when

3761.88 --> 3766.6800000000003
you're really young there's only a few

3764.61 --> 3769.23
elements really that are left of you

3766.68 --> 3771.7799999999997
it's mostly like the form of how you do

3769.23 --> 3774.03
things that stay but the actual

3771.78 --> 3777.4500000000003
inspiration what drives the person

3774.03 --> 3780.69
radically changes during puberty it does

3777.45 --> 3782.46
with almost everyone do you know what I

3780.69 --> 3784.77
mean yeah

3782.46 --> 3786.63
like the skill expression the how they

3784.77 --> 3790.2599999999998
handle themselves can be very much the

3786.63 --> 3792.57
same but they're derived they approach

3790.26 --> 3794.4300000000003
things densed a radically changed during

3792.57 --> 3797.01
poverty when all the new social

3794.43 --> 3800.73
influences and the chemistry sets in

3797.01 --> 3802.71
and then only can they start to size up

3800.73 --> 3804.03
what's going on in the world because

3802.71 --> 3806.31
when you're really young you don't

3804.03 --> 3809.4900000000002
recognize what that all that is or you

3806.31 --> 3814.0499999999997
have like a hint of it's like oh that's

3809.49 --> 3816.7799999999997
like adults gooshie stuff or something

3814.05 --> 3820.82
but you don't really understand how

3816.78 --> 3826.6090000000004
important that really is gonna become so

3820.82 --> 3828.3900000000003
yeah all right yeah it's just really

3826.609 --> 3830.99
like when you get down to the

3828.39 --> 3834.99
nitty-gritty of it it's learn is

3830.99 --> 3838.89
literally just people um is literally

3834.99 --> 3840.27
just people not really not really taking

3838.89 --> 3842.43
into account they're not paying it so

3840.27 --> 3845.22
what's really going on people aren't

3842.43 --> 3848.8199999999997
paying it's like oh it's like a own what

3845.22 --> 3850.56
is it called not mass hysteria but I

3848.82 --> 3851.82
don't know how to explain it this is

3850.56 --> 3854.369
like this whole thing where people just

3851.82 --> 3858.09
get there's so much going on it's really

3854.369 --> 3860.25
hard for your brain to we have so much

3858.09 --> 3863.01
going on all this overwhelming all these

3860.25 --> 3865.74
overwhelming aspects I'll just run on

3863.01 --> 3868.1090000000004
any environment yes well that is you

3865.74 --> 3870.18
called social unrest it's not mass

3868.109 --> 3872.72
hysteria mass hysteria is when people

3870.18 --> 3875.52
start to kill each other or themselves

3872.72 --> 3879.1189999999997
really that okay and this gets really

3875.52 --> 3881.369
serious oh that that's like for example

3879.119 --> 3883.53
when it's like oh yeah we are great we

3881.369 --> 3885.9300000000003
are great and then suddenly an army just

3883.53 --> 3888.2900000000004
starts to rip open cities yeah then you

3885.93 --> 3891.75
get a mass hysteria because everything

3888.29 --> 3894.359
it's all gone and that's when that's

3891.75 --> 3896.94
mass hysteria but yeah people are under

3894.359 --> 3899.49
pressure under unreasonable amounts of

3896.94 --> 3902.88
pressure and they're not really given a

3899.49 --> 3904.7999999999997
sum that makes sense it's like this what

3902.88 --> 3909.15
you present with it doesn't really make

3904.8 --> 3911.2200000000003
sense by the system that's what that

3909.15 --> 3913.5
just stresses everything out it kind of

3911.22 --> 3918.39
enforces a cognitive dissonance that's

3913.5 --> 3921.359
not gonna lead to a durable situation

3918.39 --> 3922.95
that's the real stressing out problem

3921.359 --> 3926.79
and that's why a lot of people then get

3922.95 --> 3929.49
maniacal about things under the pressure

3926.79 --> 3930.8089999999997
but it's not necessary it's it's social

3929.49 --> 3932.7589999999996
unrest it is what

3930.809 --> 3935.3900000000003
- also by the way spring forth

3932.759 --> 3939.359
revolutions if that it happens to be

3935.39 --> 3942.8089999999997
aligned with the political situation it

3939.359 --> 3945.119
is that lack of durability of the

3942.809 --> 3947.039
overall living situation that pushes

3945.119 --> 3950.039
that stress level that then leads to

3947.039 --> 3951.719
action but in this case the stress is

3950.039 --> 3955.829
being pushed on people that are in

3951.719 --> 3957.779
control that are the ones that are kind

3955.829 --> 3962.429
of like holding it together and that is

3957.779 --> 3967.38
just it can't last it's not built to

3962.429 --> 3972.539
last it's gonna break not wasn't

3967.38 --> 3976.799
designed to last what things things

3972.539 --> 3977.969
emerged because of a certain like that's

3976.799 --> 3980.88
what like nothing ever stays the same

3977.969 --> 3984.209
because things do emerge at a certain

3980.88 --> 3986.219
time for a certain purpose in regards to

3984.209 --> 3990.5389999999998
what's going on currently but when you

3986.219 --> 3993.7490000000003
try to when you try to keep that

3990.539 --> 3996.3590000000004
narrative afloat when it's not needed

3993.749 --> 4001.1299999999997
anymore that's when things start to

3996.359 --> 4005.449
truly go into cows cable icon I'll need

4001.13 --> 4007.309
it for what you know well you know what

4005.449 --> 4009.9790000000003
you're suggesting all that stuff is

4007.309 --> 4014.599
needed to improve the civilization

4009.979 --> 4018.439
supposedly to get a better way of doing

4014.599 --> 4020.929
things but what they really know where

4018.439 --> 4023.6299999999997
it's built upon our own principles to

4020.929 --> 4026.2690000000002
literally Daryl historically the real

4023.63 --> 4029.6890000000003
society which is reflected upon several

4026.269 --> 4032.209
periods in recorded history so that's

4029.689 --> 4034.1589999999997
the principles that actually where it's

4032.209 --> 4037.0389999999998
coming from that's the gradual gradual

4034.159 --> 4040.369
roots of where that system is coming

4037.039 --> 4043.039
from so that makes the alert that the

4040.369 --> 4045.619
fruit is obviously a trap it's like the

4043.039 --> 4051.3190000000004
the glowing eye of that deep-sea fish

4045.619 --> 4055.02
it's obviously not real and it's

4051.319 --> 4057.7799999999997
basically a hostile force it's a

4055.02 --> 4064.49
a hostile agent from the outside on the

4057.78 --> 4064.4900000000002
inside but it acts as a hostile agent

4065.03 --> 4072.15
right and that's the communism is that's

4069.96 --> 4083.52
really unfortunately what Marxist

4072.15 --> 4087.23
communism has become right right oh you

4083.52 --> 4089.55
mean I guess I was moreso speaking I

4087.23 --> 4094.98
guess I was mostly speaking in terms of

4089.55 --> 4097.02
like when there were um when there were

4094.98 --> 4100.38
certain things going on that were unjust

4097.02 --> 4104.01
to a certain group of people and that in

4100.38 --> 4107.76
that particular power stepped in and

4104.01 --> 4110.97
provided assistance in that regard

4107.76 --> 4118.97
Oh like what or they used the momentum

4110.97 --> 4121.38
of it yeah to dig in dig into power

4118.97 --> 4123.62
because that's actually what the

4121.38 --> 4127.08
Democrats have been doing from the start

4123.62 --> 4133.98
they were like the nobility digging

4127.08 --> 4136.89
their way into the the public system and

4133.98 --> 4143.669999999999
form their own nobility within that's

4136.89 --> 4148.049
how they wanna do things so they every

4143.67 --> 4150.45
time these movements on the surface seem

4148.049 --> 4152.85
like yeah everybody needs that but then

4150.45 --> 4155.849999999999
at the top the people actually leading

4152.85 --> 4158.04
this are playing their own game and the

4155.85 --> 4162.120000000001
entire movement is basically just a pawn

4158.04 --> 4164.549
in a long-term project of which the

4162.12 --> 4166.74
willing participants have no idea of the

4164.549 --> 4169.2
long-term consequences of everything

4166.74 --> 4171.0
that's gonna happen after that it's

4169.2 --> 4172.799
always on the short run we need to

4171.0 --> 4174.75
change this now and then after it's

4172.799 --> 4177.24
changed yeah everything's good that's

4174.75 --> 4180.21
the mindset usually in these types of

4177.24 --> 4183.03
social revolutions but what they didn't

4180.21 --> 4184.949
know is that it's a multi-step plan from

4183.03 --> 4186.69
the original start

4184.949 --> 4189.0
that has already been applied several

4186.69 --> 4191.339
times and the public constantly is

4189.0 --> 4197.15
oblivious of this people are not

4191.339 --> 4200.5199999999995
educated of government them aside and

4197.15 --> 4203.28
ideologies what they really do it's just

4200.52 --> 4205.679
a stab now oh it's a fascist and that is

4203.28 --> 4208.53
Hitler and that's as far as it goes for

4205.679 --> 4210.57
most people they don't really just

4208.53 --> 4212.79
associate a couple of horrible images

4210.57 --> 4214.849999999999
and a couple of sayings and they don't

4212.79 --> 4219.12
really get what's actually structurally

4214.85 --> 4221.6990000000005
structurally beneath all that right

4219.12 --> 4226.0199999999995
exactly like I thought about that like

4221.699 --> 4227.879999999999
Pete wait is that like it comes with the

4226.02 --> 4230.31
education and it comes would actually

4227.88 --> 4232.59
like when you that's like when you see

4230.31 --> 4235.8
all of the hobo stuff that's happening

4232.59 --> 4237.719
right now and this in like you you're

4235.8 --> 4238.860000000001
looking at the narratives that are being

4237.719 --> 4241.08
pushed and things aren't getting any

4238.86 --> 4242.549999999999
better things are getting worse that's

4241.08 --> 4244.26
when we really start to look at what is

4242.55 --> 4245.969
really going on what is the problem

4244.26 --> 4247.59
because you're saying that we need this

4245.969 --> 4249.75
we need that but people are suffering

4247.59 --> 4252.66
even more than they were before you

4249.75 --> 4256.82
started talking about this so-called

4252.66 --> 4260.699
liberal liberation or so-called freedom

4256.82 --> 4263.429
we're like on the chill providing Salt

4260.699 --> 4264.69
Lake or whatever security we're trying

4263.429 --> 4266.79
to provide things are good so when you

4264.69 --> 4269.639999999999
start to when people start to awake

4266.79 --> 4272.429
awake into that idea right that ignites

4269.64 --> 4275.46
right in the open a closed-loop system

4272.429 --> 4277.469
that is inflexible but when they break

4275.46 --> 4281.31
it open what are they actually building

4277.469 --> 4283.5
on top of that and that it goes for

4281.31 --> 4286.1990000000005
lawmaking in general like every time

4283.5 --> 4288.69
when it's when something new an

4286.199 --> 4291.299999999999
exception is made what is been built on

4288.69 --> 4293.178999999999
top of all that every single time that's

4291.3 --> 4297.0
how the entire Constitution is being

4293.179 --> 4300.87
supposedly bypassed through giant piles

4297.0 --> 4310.08
of paper and every time they start

4300.87 --> 4312.05
breaking the concepts yeah it's so it's

4310.08 --> 4314.94
just so

4312.05 --> 4316.89
no by the way I don't want to need to

4314.94 --> 4319.2
shout out a rebel robbed TV for the

4316.89 --> 4323.85
super chat and thank you $2 super jet

4319.2 --> 4327.21
donation much appreciated ironic you he

4323.85 --> 4329.79
was oh he was on you like him and light

4327.21 --> 4331.83
the hand were like like my uh my

4329.79 --> 4333.42
advocates yesterday cuz like yes and it

4331.83 --> 4336.66
was just really crazy after the live

4333.42 --> 4339.9
show was over like it was like like um

4336.66 --> 4343.2
we got into it with what did we get into

4339.9 --> 4344.7
it was a gym panda and a cotton like a

4343.2 --> 4347.97
couple other people who got into it with

4344.7 --> 4349.8
it was really really it was like I got

4347.97 --> 4352.38
to the ride I got so triggered I had to

4349.8 --> 4355.05
go yeah like it was it was really bad I

4352.38 --> 4357.77
didn't I knew he was bad but I didn't

4355.05 --> 4361.37
know it was it was so stupid

4357.77 --> 4364.68
welcome to the world of discord yeah

4361.37 --> 4368.76
control gutter it it is kind of on par

4364.68 --> 4371.04
with 4chan really yeah that's what I was

4368.76 --> 4373.8
thinking too glad we're your channel

4371.04 --> 4375.51
you always think like our chat room is

4373.8 --> 4378.21
like the worst you know everybody has

4375.51 --> 4380.67
like their troll types but there are

4378.21 --> 4383.52
these places where suddenly you get a

4380.67 --> 4386.1900000000005
new depth of nasty you just didn't

4383.52 --> 4387.84
realize could happen and you don't

4386.19 --> 4392.3099999999995
really want to know it and that happens

4387.84 --> 4395.4800000000005
in these kind of places yeah like yeah

4392.31 --> 4402.3
people can get that idiotically nasty

4395.48 --> 4405.8099999999995
welcome to the Internet like you were

4402.3 --> 4410.1
just you were just see stuff all the

4405.81 --> 4413.1
time the new and like experiencing it's

4410.1 --> 4415.05
totally different but is this and it's

4413.1 --> 4416.81
just and it's like better the day like

4415.05 --> 4419.34
I'm glad I wasn't completely by myself

4416.81 --> 4420.870000000001
but it like but it you know like even

4419.34 --> 4422.67
with the support it was still really

4420.87 --> 4424.41
frustrating to just even be in that

4422.67 --> 4427.65
whole thing but right behind like you

4424.41 --> 4429.8099999999995
really he released a dominantly and rob

4427.65 --> 4431.5199999999995
was like like he looked like he was

4429.81 --> 4433.89
giving that extra support it was really

4431.52 --> 4435.18
good well it was still overall like we

4433.89 --> 4436.860000000001
were able to get a lot of good points in

4435.18 --> 4437.31
regardless I wouldn't have to accept

4436.86 --> 4439.17
them

4437.31 --> 4441.75
it doesn't really matter like as long as

4439.17 --> 4443.01
it's acknowledged you know I'm saying

4441.75 --> 4444.36
like they're never going to accept

4443.01 --> 4445.119000000001
anything that goes against their

4444.36 --> 4447.13
narrative

4445.119 --> 4451.69
four vials of how much sense it makes

4447.13 --> 4454.4800000000005
total religious fanatics yes they are

4451.69 --> 4457.96
but they're spellbound they're bound by

4454.48 --> 4460.468999999999
their way their by their method by their

4457.96 --> 4463.449
method of working by their enforced

4460.469 --> 4466.4800000000005
presuppositional reason of which they

4463.449 --> 4469.178999999999
conceal the routes to themselves and

4466.48 --> 4474.82
just look at the flower that comes from

4469.179 --> 4477.099
it that's what and they look to Gaslight

4474.82 --> 4478.509999999999
to like they have this really they love

4477.099 --> 4482.2300000000005
The Gaslight you and they love to like

4478.51 --> 4485.530000000001
make them to cover up the roots just

4482.23 --> 4488.65
stare at the beautiful pictures of space

4485.53 --> 4490.119
and all the galaxies and look at the

4488.65 --> 4494.08
flower just look at the flower don't

4490.119 --> 4496.509999999999
look at the rear that's it the flower

4494.08 --> 4500.92
don't look at their roots that's their

4496.51 --> 4504.070000000001
religion yeah basically yeah they don't

4500.92 --> 4506.8
want to let it go and it's like it's

4504.07 --> 4508.929
like it's just treated like a fantasy

4506.8 --> 4510.79
like if somebody told you so I told you

4508.929 --> 4513.369
wrestling's not real did you let go on a

4510.79 --> 4514.659
raging whatever and attack the people

4513.369 --> 4518.92
that told you wrestling wasn't real no

4514.659 --> 4520.78
you like but because it's og hey space

4518.92 --> 4525.76
isn't real it's impossible for it to

4520.78 --> 4529.2699999999995
exist oh my god well it's just it's so

4525.76 --> 4532.06
sad well it's not but you know the

4529.27 --> 4535.51
problem is if you really want to be fair

4532.06 --> 4537.219
about it ah ha I was push it but if you

4535.51 --> 4540.25
really if you really want to be fair

4537.219 --> 4544.69
about it you can't just say like outer

4540.25 --> 4547.78
space is not real but because it is too

4544.69 --> 4549.879999999999
much lights out before it and that's not

4547.78 --> 4552.13
fair because in reality we don't really

4549.88 --> 4554.29
know what is up there what we do know is

4552.13 --> 4555.719
that the set of proposed as we get to

4554.29 --> 4558.639
see in the science fiction movies

4555.719 --> 4561.06
suppose the gravity less environment

4558.639 --> 4563.83
with an sucking out of space vacuum

4561.06 --> 4567.7300000000005
that's never gonna happen but whatever

4563.83 --> 4572.5
may be up there could be very

4567.73 --> 4575.25
interesting still in some way so I would

4572.5 --> 4578.38
say I don't want to take away like that

4575.25 --> 4579.01
potential new ground it might still be

4578.38 --> 4584.5
interesting

4579.01 --> 4588.43
to explore up there you know not to find

4584.5 --> 4592.2
planets but to find interesting

4588.43 --> 4595.6
phenomena perhaps new effects no typing

4592.2 --> 4598.3
like that's what's so crazy it's like

4595.6 --> 4600.34
I'm pretty sure I'm positive that they

4598.3 --> 4602.110000000001
have tried to get up there and every

4600.34 --> 4603.85
going to I'm including it's like there's

4602.11 --> 4605.049999999999
no word I think that the problem is is

4603.85 --> 4607.3
that they get to a certain point where

4605.05 --> 4610.18
they can't go on a fire right but who's

4607.3 --> 4611.95
to say that that is not our overcome a

4610.18 --> 4615.67
wall that it won't just take a certain

4611.95 --> 4618.13
time to approach it all from the new

4615.67 --> 4622.72
angle and then bypass the original

4618.13 --> 4624.91
problem that's true maybe they already

4622.72 --> 4627.16
can in there just waiting until like

4624.91 --> 4629.53
yeah like this is too

4627.16 --> 4631.36
they're too complex too obvious to

4629.53 --> 4633.37
conceal so maybe they're waiting for the

4631.36 --> 4636.58
whole globe right to sit out until

4633.37 --> 4638.0199999999995
they're gonna proceed with that maybe

4636.58 --> 4640.0599999999995
it's something like that you don't know

4638.02 --> 4642.910000000001
you don't know what they really know and

4640.06 --> 4644.530000000001
how they decide what they decide to do

4642.91 --> 4650.08
with all that knowledge how that works

4644.53 --> 4651.94
really mmm there's like a lot of

4650.08 --> 4654.3099999999995
knowledge I'm pretty sure that is just

4651.94 --> 4657.25
out there in boxes is like yeah we

4654.31 --> 4659.47
figured out this whole technology but it

4657.25 --> 4661.51
has like too much influences to just

4659.47 --> 4664.42
start out introducing it so there's like

4661.51 --> 4666.4890000000005
yeah could we do this could we how are

4664.42 --> 4668.05
we gonna puzzle these new introductions

4666.489 --> 4671.679999999999
together with what is there and the

4668.05 --> 4674.77
illusions that are still ongoing is it

4671.68 --> 4676.42
not gonna disrupt that's how I think

4674.77 --> 4682.9890000000005
that they really make these long-term

4676.42 --> 4684.16
plans for society mmm memory like that's

4682.989 --> 4687.04
that's a pretty good point

4684.16 --> 4688.48
like that's why it's almost like it's

4687.04 --> 4690.67
weird because it's like they will this

4688.48 --> 4693.04
be too much for the public to handle

4690.67 --> 4696.0
will this be too much of a bit late well

4693.04 --> 4698.41
Technol technologically disruptive

4696.0 --> 4701.08
interference between one system type

4698.41 --> 4704.17
that is widening and becoming we like

4701.08 --> 4706.42
for example the telephone system I think

4704.17 --> 4709.81
it's pretty certain that expanded

4706.42 --> 4711.84
telephone wireless systems but

4709.81 --> 4715.05
definitely not Coral

4711.84 --> 4718.08
work properly next together to a free

4715.05 --> 4720.87
energy Tesla type of system where you

4718.08 --> 4722.24
could then receive it from the air the

4720.87 --> 4725.82
energy I think that would probably

4722.24 --> 4728.19
disrupt each cell see that there are

4725.82 --> 4730.889999999999
like technology directions that are just

4728.19 --> 4733.32
gonna disrupt each other one type of

4730.89 --> 4737.58
system is going to take up the medium of

4733.32 --> 4739.349999999999
the other one to function properly maybe

4737.58 --> 4745.41
this is getting a very complex now but

4739.35 --> 4748.200000000001
yeah technology no I'm I'm just doing

4745.41 --> 4750.51
I've just never heard like like when you

4748.2 --> 4751.679999999999
were talking about on the free light it

4750.51 --> 4755.31
would they would end up clashing

4751.68 --> 4758.240000000001
basically that yeah Tesla met the others

4755.31 --> 4760.830000000001
maybe hmm

4758.24 --> 4762.9
well I would like what would happen if

4760.83 --> 4765.0599999999995
that was if there was just one medium to

4762.9 --> 4767.639999999999
reference to so like if we just had that

4765.06 --> 4770.1
one aspect a little bit being both of

4767.64 --> 4773.910000000001
them having to co-exist well then all

4770.1 --> 4776.9400000000005
the unique applications of manipulation

4773.91 --> 4778.8
would suddenly be gone hmm

4776.94 --> 4781.049999999999
because that is what the short wave

4778.8 --> 4783.09
system is so useful for that's why they

4781.05 --> 4784.89
specifically attuned to brain function

4783.09 --> 4786.77
to in order to secretly be able to

4784.89 --> 4789.570000000001
manipulate with it at some point or

4786.77 --> 4793.8
gradually or however the option and

4789.57 --> 4796.71
Tesla level that type of energy usage

4793.8 --> 4799.320000000001
doesn't do that it's high it's high

4796.71 --> 4801.18
voltage it just has benefits it actually

4799.32 --> 4803.7
clears up the mind it does exactly the

4801.18 --> 4805.860000000001
opposite thing and it's not something

4803.7 --> 4810.57
you secretly turn-on like if it's

4805.86 --> 4813.8099999999995
running it will have that effect so it

4810.57 --> 4821.04
yeah yeah totally and on semester them

4813.81 --> 4822.990000000001
again oh yes gosh I was oh man then like

4821.04 --> 4826.1
I wonder what that would be like I

4822.99 --> 4830.25
really do because I do amazing wonders

4826.1 --> 4834.09
yeah music for ensign did my favor you

4830.25 --> 4837.09
just I say that's amazing

4834.09 --> 4839.46
like I've seen Nathan Antion the

4837.09 --> 4843.0
conceptualization of Philander's I've

4839.46 --> 4845.31
seen things of that in my visions I went

4843.0 --> 4848.41
all over the place

4845.31 --> 4856.240000000001
throughout time with my spirit met some

4848.41 --> 4859.2699999999995
very unexpected to see people and that

4856.24 --> 4862.3
like so that's how you try it oh yeah

4859.27 --> 4863.92
yeah that's what but like like I said

4862.3 --> 4866.47
like oh is it I'm really really

4863.92 --> 4869.67
imaginative but there's like so like

4866.47 --> 4871.570000000001
there's Oz where I'm just sitting and

4869.67 --> 4875.11
there's other I'm just sitting and I'm

4871.57 --> 4878.59
meditating and I'm like my big issue is

4875.11 --> 4881.259999999999
that I have a really I struggle with

4878.59 --> 4884.95
organizing my thoughts properly I have

4881.26 --> 4887.2300000000005
focused so many amazing ideas and I

4884.95 --> 4888.25
tried it it's it's so hard for me to

4887.23 --> 4891.129999999999
focus I feel like there's always

4888.25 --> 4891.64
something just I have a very good thing

4891.13 --> 4893.77
up mine

4891.64 --> 4896.68
I've a very good tip for you on learning

4893.77 --> 4898.56
how to focus with imagination because

4896.68 --> 4903.16
you have to take into account

4898.56 --> 4906.31
imagination is like a television scream

4903.16 --> 4909.7
with a certain frequency like a story a

4906.31 --> 4911.950000000001
direction that upholds it and it takes

4909.7 --> 4915.3099999999995
energy and the bigger and the more

4911.95 --> 4917.139999999999
complex it is the more skill you need to

4915.31 --> 4920.34
maintain it and it starts to cost more

4917.14 --> 4921.97
energy so make sure that you're always

4920.34 --> 4924.43
compartmentalizing whatever is going to

4921.97 --> 4927.67
spring forth from it you like cut it

4924.43 --> 4929.16
like grass before it starts to take up

4927.67 --> 4934.39
too much energy

4929.16 --> 4937.78
hmm you can just say like it's a because

4934.39 --> 4941.79
no nothing you can conceptualize is like

4937.78 --> 4945.219999999999
so unique that will only appear once

4941.79 --> 4947.17
ideas spring naturally forth from a

4945.22 --> 4950.110000000001
frequency and if you maintain that

4947.17 --> 4952.27
frequency precisely the great likelihood

4950.11 --> 4956.83
you out of nowhere will come up with the

4952.27 --> 4958.4800000000005
same idea that you'd forgotten so I

4956.83 --> 4960.55
don't have to ever be afraid you're

4958.48 --> 4963.15
gonna forget a unique idea in a unique

4960.55 --> 4965.62
moment or some kind of thing you've seen

4963.15 --> 4970.65
because it will always come back to you

4965.62 --> 4976.17
I technically think that

4970.65 --> 4977.82
people can't really forget anything even

4976.17 --> 4980.46
though I'd in a certain moment have

4977.82 --> 4983.5199999999995
trouble remembering something truly

4980.46 --> 4986.85
forgetting is I think not really

4983.52 --> 4996.870000000001
possible it will always be somewhere

4986.85 --> 5002.93
inside of your spirit yeah cut off in a

4996.87 --> 5005.96
tangent again yeah

5002.93 --> 5008.63
no wait notice everyone anything that

5005.96 --> 5010.76
cuz it's because it's just um it's so

5008.63 --> 5013.06
difficult for me like being able to do

5010.76 --> 5015.83
that I've had write and I've had like

5013.06 --> 5017.830000000001
like when I was younger it was it was a

5015.83 --> 5020.0599999999995
lot more I was a lot more in tune with

5017.83 --> 5021.92
with that aspect of myself as I've

5020.06 --> 5024.77
gotten older it's been a lot harder to

5021.92 --> 5027.32
maintain so I've been wanting to build

5024.77 --> 5029.900000000001
and work on that more and try and try

5027.32 --> 5031.91
more holistic methods on the book

5029.9 --> 5035.0
because our minds are so important like

5031.91 --> 5038.33
they're literally focused right it's all

5035.0 --> 5041.54
about the focus yeah and it's also a

5038.33 --> 5043.7
kind of a decision because it is like

5041.54 --> 5045.47
sometimes there's like jobs for excite

5043.7 --> 5047.2699999999995
you of course know about this and

5045.47 --> 5049.070000000001
there's some jobs that are a little bit

5047.27 --> 5050.450000000001
more strained 'fl it's like okay you're

5049.07 --> 5053.8099999999995
you're gonna go to work and you have to

5050.45 --> 5055.849999999999
get that tension specifically from it

5053.81 --> 5057.080000000001
and you need that otherwise you're not

5055.85 --> 5059.6900000000005
gonna pay it you're not gonna do it

5057.08 --> 5062.99
right well it's the same thing with

5059.69 --> 5066.589999999999
taking your visualization and your

5062.99 --> 5070.4
imagination very serious you can only

5066.59 --> 5073.37
really learn how to do it if you put

5070.4 --> 5075.5
actual effort into it not effort that's

5073.37 --> 5077.45
gonna be demanded by some social

5075.5 --> 5080.09
structure around you but by your own

5077.45 --> 5083.0599999999995
decision making and I've decided that

5080.09 --> 5086.4800000000005
long though so I've been undergoing a

5083.06 --> 5088.990000000001
training program more than well let's

5086.48 --> 5091.37
just say just literally my entire life

5088.99 --> 5094.219999999999
started out as a mission given to me by

5091.37 --> 5098.36
my parents I was really good at it

5094.22 --> 5099.860000000001
and then I didn't take it so seriously

5098.36 --> 5102.62
anymore but it came naturally and

5099.86 --> 5103.63
eventually like I felt I lost control

5102.62 --> 5106.69
and now I'm

5103.63 --> 5109.929
like this I can take this even further

5106.69 --> 5112.419999999999
I'm going this is a very serious project

5109.929 --> 5117.37
for me my visualization I'm gonna use

5112.42 --> 5119.7390000000005
this to improve things and thus when I

5117.37 --> 5124.33
do it there is just a certain level of

5119.739 --> 5130.75
tension that helps maintain it but you

5124.33 --> 5134.5
have to level it up over time I always

5130.75 --> 5137.08
focus especially in the start the

5134.5 --> 5139.929
guidance is very can be very helpful and

5137.08 --> 5142.54
then you pretty much have to start out

5139.929 --> 5145.389
by taking dominance in the conversation

5142.54 --> 5147.79
and then kind of what do what I do but

5145.389 --> 5150.37
you have to do it for example just go

5147.79 --> 5155.19
into very fine details for yourself and

5150.37 --> 5158.8
just maintain that focus as you do it so

5155.19 --> 5166.33
yeah maybe next time because I was kind

5158.8 --> 5168.639
of supposed to run out and show but I'd

5166.33 --> 5170.679
love to see you actively do that

5168.639 --> 5173.139
sometime because I know you have the

5170.679 --> 5180.46
talent for it I felt it from the start

5173.139 --> 5182.83
no oh yes hello yes yes you do because

5180.46 --> 5185.38
you're already growing and if you start

5182.83 --> 5187.48
way in the back and you start to grow

5185.38 --> 5189.219
vastly forward there's a big chance

5187.48 --> 5191.739
you're actually gonna be a master at it

5189.219 --> 5196.12
in contrast to somebody that didn't have

5191.739 --> 5199.449
that I never really even tried to push

5196.12 --> 5203.11
it it's the same with me I was not a

5199.449 --> 5206.23
speaker when I was young I was a silent

5203.11 --> 5208.8099999999995
guy always looking at it I was very

5206.23 --> 5212.5199999999995
nervous to talk about express myself

5208.81 --> 5215.139
very nervous and because of that

5212.52 --> 5218.8
eventually I forced my way through that

5215.139 --> 5221.11
and now I've built all this skill in the

5218.8 --> 5225.54
process that somebody that didn't have

5221.11 --> 5230.07
that natural yeah retroactive instincts

5225.54 --> 5232.54
they would not be so good at their skill

5230.07 --> 5234.13
doing this they would be a little bit

5232.54 --> 5236.32
more mechanical because they don't have

5234.13 --> 5237.1990000000005
so much feel for it because their life

5236.32 --> 5241.849
didn't die

5237.199 --> 5245.629999999999
we depend on it when they were young mm

5241.849 --> 5250.209
and you have the same potential I can

5245.63 --> 5253.969
feel it and you've already come very far

5250.209 --> 5255.769
no there are this way I wish I had you

5253.969 --> 5257.719
know what you know it's not so I'm still

5255.769 --> 5259.400000000001
pretty young so I still have time to

5257.719 --> 5263.449
learn and grow into that

5259.4 --> 5266.36
absolutely not more so absolutely not to

5263.449 --> 5269.659
it definitely not no it's just the

5266.36 --> 5271.82
beginning when you start to see it and

5269.659 --> 5276.289
you want it and you start to work on it

5271.82 --> 5279.409
that's the beginning it's like with

5276.289 --> 5281.509999999999
becoming a farmer when you start out a

5279.409 --> 5283.459
farmer it's just all work at the

5281.51 --> 5286.159000000001
beginning all hard work usually if you

5283.459 --> 5288.979
want to do it right but after a while

5286.159 --> 5292.129999999999
then the fruits start coming and you

5288.979 --> 5295.280000000001
improve and more and more and eventually

5292.13 --> 5297.769
you'll be doing it all the time it'll be

5295.28 --> 5300.92
second nature and you will always reap

5297.769 --> 5306.769
good harvests unless the circumstances

5300.92 --> 5311.959
just make it impossible but that's funny

5306.769 --> 5315.709
actually I don't technically I want to

5311.959 --> 5318.11
have a vegetable garden and fruit I want

5315.709 --> 5320.749
to basically have a mirror image of what

5318.11 --> 5323.15
I used to have with my mother my old

5320.749 --> 5326.63
house which was just a good house with a

5323.15 --> 5329.239
paradise old back garden we even had a

5326.63 --> 5332.409000000001
swimming small swimming pool eventually

5329.239 --> 5338.268999999999
but just with fruits everywhere and just

5332.409 --> 5343.518999999999
cats and rabbits and I love it maybe a

5338.269 --> 5346.309
goat yes maybe a goat look yeah for the

5343.519 --> 5346.76
goat milk I believe we're gonna have

5346.309 --> 5350.42
children

5346.76 --> 5352.159000000001
oh oh oh and benjamin got that totally

5350.42 --> 5356.15
right and chickens of course don't

5352.159 --> 5360.11
forget chickens oh yes cancer tuco -

5356.15 --> 5361.879999999999
funny good or end chickens yeah just

5360.11 --> 5365.209
having animals around like there's this

5361.88 --> 5368.36
soul like you know like it does

5365.209 --> 5369.65
something to have like just interacting

5368.36 --> 5371.03
with different kinds of creatures in

5369.65 --> 5372.86
nature you know plants

5371.03 --> 5374.57
well at they're right there looking

5372.86 --> 5376.489
things well you interact with them and

5374.57 --> 5378.7699999999995
you feel their vibrational energy yes so

5376.489 --> 5380.989
like when you you develop a bond with

5378.77 --> 5384.110000000001
them as well so it's like an absolutely

5380.989 --> 5387.86
help and not just death because the

5384.11 --> 5392.239
herders the keepers of animals like farm

5387.86 --> 5394.4
animals are have a parent role they have

5392.239 --> 5396.558999999999
a direct influence on the animal and the

5394.4 --> 5399.65
animal knows it so if they really treat

5396.559 --> 5405.110000000001
that animal preciously and raise it very

5399.65 --> 5406.848999999999
seriously then they will bear great yeah

5405.11 --> 5409.789
they will reflect upon that they will

5406.849 --> 5412.07
might even become smartly attuned to you

5409.789 --> 5414.259999999999
as a person like a familiar if I had

5412.07 --> 5418.489
that happened with me and my cat like I

5414.26 --> 5421.369000000001
really raised that cat and she she like

5418.489 --> 5425.089999999999
was another like another compadre a

5421.369 --> 5427.219
presence that that we had like a ranking

5425.09 --> 5432.349
system that was going on it was amazing

5427.219 --> 5434.389
that you can do that and the same goes

5432.349 --> 5437.96
for plants but also for animals if you

5434.389 --> 5442.639
raise it themselves they can yeah you

5437.96 --> 5445.219
can learn to apply care and then reap

5442.639 --> 5446.929
the fruits of it and then if you if you

5445.219 --> 5450.199
naturally grow up with that see that

5446.929 --> 5451.789
happen then you also eventually figure

5450.199 --> 5455.509999999999
out you can do that with people as well

5451.789 --> 5457.429
and it'll be kind of the same thing yeah

5455.51 --> 5461.389
although you have to recognize the

5457.429 --> 5464.2390000000005
Seavers of course in it but yeah it's

5461.389 --> 5469.13
it's a good skill to build for social

5464.239 --> 5473.449
building vencie to have animals to take

5469.13 --> 5475.76
care of when you're young yeah because

5473.449 --> 5479.2699999999995
you'll notice the reaping of the fruits

5475.76 --> 5481.25
of your care and when you're like you

5479.27 --> 5483.9800000000005
have a lousy period in your teenage

5481.25 --> 5486.55
times and you neglect things you know

5483.98 --> 5486.549999999999
that as well

5492.55 --> 5499.55
I'm sorry I was just thinking about my

5494.96 --> 5502.94
teenage years you're like oh like it's

5499.55 --> 5505.1
just I feel like they were pretty there

5502.94 --> 5507.349999999999
they weren't bad but it's just there are

5505.1 --> 5509.33
a lot of things that I know I missed out

5507.35 --> 5511.400000000001
on and maybe that was for a purpose a

5509.33 --> 5516.04
reason why they miss out on those things

5511.4 --> 5518.54
but okay look like like what like just

5516.04 --> 5520.46
you know I was late like that you know I

5518.54 --> 5523.58
said before I was more I was more

5520.46 --> 5525.2
confined like at home and everything

5523.58 --> 5527.54
like that like I had social interactions

5525.2 --> 5530.8099999999995
but not as like I wasn't like you know a

5527.54 --> 5532.64
part of the own you know like part of a

5530.81 --> 5535.280000000001
big social group like that or programs

5532.64 --> 5536.33
like that so I was a bit more that

5535.28 --> 5538.219999999999
that's one thing that kind of

5536.33 --> 5540.7699999999995
contributed to me becoming more

5538.22 --> 5542.87
reclusive like I said when I was younger

5540.77 --> 5544.43
I was more much more jovial free

5542.87 --> 5546.68
spirited when I got older I started to

5544.43 --> 5550.31
become more self-conscious and reclusive

5546.68 --> 5552.83
and not really wanting to interact with

5550.31 --> 5554.9890000000005
people being afraid that they would look

5552.83 --> 5556.16
at me a certain way or that they would

5554.989 --> 5557.15
cease they would see something wrong

5556.16 --> 5558.349999999999
with me and they wouldn't want to be

5557.15 --> 5562.759999999999
around me they wouldn't want to talk to

5558.35 --> 5564.650000000001
me and all that because yeah like I

5562.76 --> 5567.05
ended up going to like in my teammate my

5564.65 --> 5568.7
teenage years were really really like

5567.05 --> 5571.43
that's why I really only have a small

5568.7 --> 5574.01
group of friends and in that small group

5571.43 --> 5576.47
I was that's that's all I really had

5574.01 --> 5579.38
like I was I was afraid to try to make

5576.47 --> 5582.35
other long less in relationships or when

5579.38 --> 5584.4800000000005
I would try people would people wouldn't

5582.35 --> 5585.650000000001
be very responsive people weren't you

5584.48 --> 5588.23
know I'm saying I wouldn't say not

5585.65 --> 5591.08
seriously as seriously as you needed it

5588.23 --> 5593.259999999999
for them to do I know exactly what you

5591.08 --> 5596.03
mean right

5593.26 --> 5599.360000000001
super superficial relations and they

5596.03 --> 5600.739
know supposedly hundreds of people but

5599.36 --> 5603.41
they know don't know them really well

5600.739 --> 5605.419999999999
and they're going with their intuition

5603.41 --> 5607.58
that they have special skills for it to

5605.42 --> 5610.46
oversee that they won't know them as

5607.58 --> 5616.489
well as you and me will because we need

5610.46 --> 5618.7300000000005
that that extra attention that extra

5616.489 --> 5618.73
depth

5619.55 --> 5624.78
you know like it's just and sometimes I

5622.59 --> 5628.14
I should say I wish I wasn't like that

5624.78 --> 5630.24
but it's it's very it's very draining

5628.14 --> 5633.27
and then the people that she end up do

5630.24 --> 5634.74
forming bonds with there are the types

5633.27 --> 5636.620000000001
of people that just take and take and

5634.74 --> 5639.62
take and it'll really give back and

5636.62 --> 5642.599999999999
those in those relationships are just so

5639.62 --> 5644.22
so horrible because you're willing to

5642.6 --> 5645.780000000001
give yourself to this person you really

5644.22 --> 5647.31
genuinely care about this person but

5645.78 --> 5648.96
they don't really care about you

5647.31 --> 5651.09
and you don't realize it until you have

5648.96 --> 5652.77
nothing left and then they're like okay

5651.09 --> 5655.26
I was taking all I can get I'm gonna

5652.77 --> 5657.330000000001
move on and it's like that they need to

5655.26 --> 5659.7300000000005
show appreciation for what you're giving

5657.33 --> 5663.65
them they don't even see it don't give

5659.73 --> 5668.48
recognition then it's just time to go

5663.65 --> 5670.92
yeah it's just yes I'm so I've tried to

5668.48 --> 5673.62
I've tried to just you know I'm done

5670.92 --> 5675.93
with it basically I try not to get into

5673.62 --> 5678.45
that anymore like I need someone who's

5675.93 --> 5681.42
on my same vibrational level I can't I

5678.45 --> 5683.34
can't get with someone who's who's that

5681.42 --> 5684.72
who like it's like if we both give to

5683.34 --> 5688.53
each other it would have to be like that

5684.72 --> 5690.72
like like they give and I can and I and

5688.53 --> 5693.3
another another one of my issues is that

5690.72 --> 5696.6
I don't really isn't that I don't like

5693.3 --> 5699.18
to receive but I don't that I don't like

5696.6 --> 5701.04
to be showered and all of this you know

5699.18 --> 5702.81
like oh you give me this you give you

5701.04 --> 5705.39
that vulva I'm sorry I'm getting way too

5702.81 --> 5708.21
personal mieze around oh yeah you're

5705.39 --> 5711.18
just modest I find come straightforward

5708.21 --> 5714.27
compliments very embarrassing as well so

5711.18 --> 5716.58
I know what you mean but you got to take

5714.27 --> 5720.6
it though it can be an insult not to

5716.58 --> 5722.61
properly take it it's weird that's you

5720.6 --> 5725.13
have to realize that sometimes somebody

5722.61 --> 5729.389999999999
it means a lot for them to really give a

5725.13 --> 5732.36
compliment so you should take it and not

5729.39 --> 5734.04
and not then make it about you by being

5732.36 --> 5738.098999999999
embarrassed of it it's very difficult I

5734.04 --> 5742.3
I still have trouble with that but

5738.099 --> 5745.2300000000005
do you know what I mean absolutely I

5742.3 --> 5754.389
[Music]

5745.23 --> 5758.169999999999
mean they found me oh my gosh very loud

5754.389 --> 5759.88
yes the police racing by its I remember

5758.17 --> 5762.07
her I've already thought somebody's

5759.88 --> 5765.31
biking that they're not gonna come for

5762.07 --> 5767.29
that but I've only ever heard those

5765.31 --> 5769.21
sirens on TV like you know they don't

5767.29 --> 5770.739
sound like that down there Oh I said

5769.21 --> 5772.869
down here they don't sound like that

5770.739 --> 5774.848999999999
over here so hearing that I was like

5772.869 --> 5780.098999999999
sounds like yeah the sessions are

5774.849 --> 5781.3
different in different regions no it

5780.099 --> 5786.88
might be the axes that it was a fire

5781.3 --> 5790.900000000001
took well yeah that I think they pretty

5786.88 --> 5792.88
much old made it the same siren know it

5790.9 --> 5794.848999999999
used to be different sirens but I think

5792.88 --> 5797.2300000000005
it's pretty much all the same now

5794.849 --> 5799.119000000001
because I really like to look what is

5797.23 --> 5801.19
gonna come past good it wasn't a fire

5799.119 --> 5805.48
truck or is it an ambulance or is it a

5801.19 --> 5809.949
police I I can't really distinguish the

5805.48 --> 5813.848999999999
it's all the same to me now mmm yeah

5809.949 --> 5815.739
like you know and Atlanta they they have

5813.849 --> 5818.38
distinct sounds and everything like that

5815.739 --> 5819.839999999999
I don't like them and you're like in

5818.38 --> 5821.8
your area I guess they've made it more

5819.84 --> 5825.52
they made them more the same when

5821.8 --> 5829.06
everything looks yeah well you have to

5825.52 --> 5834.099
get out of the way anyways a really

5829.06 --> 5838.75
better yeah you know pick up yeah well

5834.099 --> 5841.3
so hey the going over time for 25

5838.75 --> 5842.92
minutes but it's been great so but I'm

5841.3 --> 5844.71
really gonna run out to show now it's

5842.92 --> 5847.2390000000005
been so lovely to have you on your

5844.71 --> 5848.86
you're fantastic conversationalist I

5847.239 --> 5853.209999999999
love the conversations we have

5848.86 --> 5854.29
I really hope to continue in and I hope

5853.21 --> 5858.219
you enjoyed it as well

5854.29 --> 5860.469
oh yeah I know I was kind of in and out

5858.219 --> 5862.0
but I was yeah I was trying to listen to

5860.469 --> 5862.659
as much as possible yeah don't worry

5862.0 --> 5868.42
about it

5862.659 --> 5870.369
well yeah great yeah what I prefer

5868.42 --> 5871.06
talking versus chatting I'm realizing

5870.369 --> 5874.089999999999
right now

5871.06 --> 5877.030000000001
I feel I can say more

5874.09 --> 5880.21
I agree but on the debates as well you

5877.03 --> 5882.3099999999995
know I want to get all personal about it

5880.21 --> 5884.26
looked like sometimes when John comes on

5882.31 --> 5885.780000000001
and you already know what he's gonna be

5884.26 --> 5889.66
doing it like he gets really noisy

5885.78 --> 5890.59
immediately and I'm just like oh god I

5889.66 --> 5893.38
know

5890.59 --> 5895.33
it's literally gonna be him shouting at

5893.38 --> 5897.07
people and calling them clowns for 20

5895.33 --> 5898.48
minutes straight and anybody that dares

5897.07 --> 5900.46
to interrupt is gonna get the full

5898.48 --> 5902.7699999999995
bearish so last time that happens is

5900.46 --> 5907.18
like okay I'm gonna go now this is this

5902.77 --> 5908.580000000001
is gonna suck from Iran when he is in

5907.18 --> 5913.360000000001
one of his moods

5908.58 --> 5915.25
yeah it's more than rarity so he was

5913.36 --> 5919.03
being a little rough yesterday too when

5915.25 --> 5921.28
I was trying to say something in yeah I

5919.03 --> 5923.65
was just like oh my god it seems really

5921.28 --> 5925.78
both do this to me it wasn't I could say

5923.65 --> 5927.61
he wasn't trying to be mean but it was

5925.78 --> 5929.139999999999
just like being relaxed like I'm trying

5927.61 --> 5930.94
to get it out like give me a minute

5929.14 --> 5933.58
oh you know I'm saying like he gets

5930.94 --> 5935.5
really you know I'm saying and I and I

5933.58 --> 5937.75
understand like you know we're doing the

5935.5 --> 5940.32
show like it hasn't quit but I was just

5937.75 --> 5943.09
trying to address the nonsense that

5940.32 --> 5945.82
people saying like you know I will say

5943.09 --> 5948.49
was nonsense necessarily but it was it

5945.82 --> 5951.7
was his I always notice when Pete says

5948.49 --> 5956.7699999999995
it but this time he was unusually clear

5951.7 --> 5959.65
and actually interesting Hey like if Wow

5956.77 --> 5961.9800000000005
Pete you're unusually interesting

5959.65 --> 5964.599999999999
normally it's just our star kisser but

5961.98 --> 5967.2699999999995
yeah he was I had a clear moment or

5964.6 --> 5973.84
something maybe he's trying to merit

5967.27 --> 5975.55
coffee as well no it does

5973.84 --> 5979.17
wait there's a lot more I kind of talked

5975.55 --> 5982.24

tomorrow with flat earth early-bird

6066.379 --> 6074.629
number 194 and yeah hashtag me if of

6072.169 --> 6078.169
course I'm yeah I've looked into the Hat

6074.629 --> 6083.329
unfortunately it it will cost some they

6078.169 --> 6084.949
had a minimum of 25 and it's I've

6083.329 --> 6088.28
calculate it's pretty much gonna end up

6084.949 --> 6089.659
like 250 euros and then I'll get 25 of

6088.28 --> 6092.809
these hats but I don't even know how

6089.659 --> 6095.449
they're gonna look really but yeah maybe

6092.809 --> 6098.019
I'm gonna have to do a GoFundMe for this

6095.449 --> 6100.579
as well because 250 euros is not exactly

6098.019 --> 6103.399
in my surplus right now unfortunately

6100.579 --> 6107.719
I'd hoped I could take one example but

6103.399 --> 6111.619000000001
no they want a minimum of that well but

6107.719 --> 6114.609
it's still in the plans to get hashtag

6111.619 --> 6117.799999999999
me 4 hats so actually make it a thing

6114.609 --> 6121.969
right so until the next letters

6117.8 --> 6125.05
early-bird keep it flat and have a nice

6121.969 --> 6125.05
sunny day

6125.21 --> 6156.369
