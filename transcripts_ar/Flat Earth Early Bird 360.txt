69.259 --> 78.409
chats we're much appreciated and well

72.89 --> 82.909
necessary so good morning everyone let's

78.409 --> 85.759
see the weather today is yeah it's kind

82.909 --> 91.009
of dreary keeps on raining and then not

85.759 --> 96.22
raining again raining again a paper

91.009 --> 108.879
round somewhere that should be doable

96.22 --> 108.879
but yeah typical no barely any Sun what

112.31 --> 122.13
so yeah today I have Tamera coffee with

115.68 --> 124.61000000000001
me in tea and a tangerine I thought it

122.13 --> 124.61
was a good idea

132.03 --> 140.05
yeah yeah I took it's funny I've been

138.1 --> 143.59
taking tumeric off you now in the

140.05 --> 145.77
morning as well I do a little just very

143.59 --> 148.45000000000002
light dosage and it's actually extremely

145.77 --> 150.54000000000002
pleasant starting up so yeah Tamera

148.45 --> 156.95999999999998
coffees just growing into more and more

150.54 --> 164.2
success it's proven in my metabolism so

156.96 --> 166.26000000000002
yeah little updated with that and yeah

164.2 --> 168.91
of course

166.26 --> 171.7
Riley's video I didn't see it life

168.91 --> 174.35999999999999
because it went out very late and I

171.7 --> 179.17
actually went back to bed early again

174.36 --> 182.47000000000003
and weirdly enough I ate pizza again but

179.17 --> 184.01999999999998
I don't feel bad at all today so I can't

182.47 --> 187.9
really explain it

184.02 --> 191.49
I've tried to call my healer but yeah I

187.9 --> 195.459
couldn't get into contact with him and

191.49 --> 200.26000000000002
so that's all in the long run and yeah

195.459 --> 209.29
but man he really pulled my heartstrings

200.26 --> 213.42
there Tony and his little doggy yeah I

209.29 --> 217.72
know I was in kind of a similar position

213.42 --> 221.22
five years ago with my cat and I told

217.72 --> 225.37
that story a couple of times just

221.22 --> 227.5
majorly tragic to me and I really hope

225.37 --> 232.42000000000002
that while Tony is in a better position

227.5 --> 235.81
in a sense that yeah he has resources he

232.42 --> 238.39
can do things and and he's trying out

235.81 --> 242.459
stuffs trying out CBD oil I really hope

238.39 --> 242.45899999999997
it it does something

243.28 --> 253.75
what's this yeah but yeah I I empathize

249.58 --> 264.82
greatly and sympathize but empathize a

253.75 --> 266.92
bit too right yeah but it's not yeah

264.82 --> 271.0
well of course it's helping it and just

266.92 --> 274.6
Tony doesn't wanna doesn't want him to

271.0 --> 276.73
go but it's also a bit of a mystery as

274.6 --> 281.08000000000004
to exactly what it is that's going on

276.73 --> 285.58000000000004
that that ailment that sickness like the

281.08 --> 287.8
doctors don't really have an answer so

285.58 --> 290.59
it's it's kind of like a puzzle as to

287.8 --> 292.72
what is that what is going on and that

290.59 --> 294.42999999999995
add that also I'm just very curious to

292.72 --> 300.07000000000005
ask my either and I'm probably gonna ask

294.43 --> 303.85
my dad as well because my dad's yeah my

300.07 --> 306.43
mother-in-law she is a great dog lover

303.85 --> 308.53000000000003
in the sense that she's had dogs a lot

306.43 --> 311.77
and she has a lot of dogs right now and

308.53 --> 313.53
maybe she's heard of it maybe she has

311.77 --> 317.71
something interesting to say about it

313.53 --> 320.65
and they're well acquainted with the

317.71 --> 328.59999999999997
alternative sector so I'm gonna ask them

320.65 --> 330.94
for advice as well so yeah I think

328.6 --> 337.3
there's a good chance that we can figure

330.94 --> 339.71999999999997
it out but it is still the eyes get out

337.3 --> 339.72
here

343.25 --> 348.319
[Music]

351.289 --> 355.78999999999996
yeah it's tense

353.45 --> 359.95
anyway yeah I'm gonna go through chat

355.79 --> 364.36
before it's all trolled to hell mm-hmm

359.95 --> 368.69
right so a GM was first Giulio Pavan

364.36 --> 374.78000000000003
when the young James Mason ego plane in

368.69 --> 380.51
Anchorage or Sanford over moco Tom

374.78 --> 384.36999999999995
Parker brand and the studio 68 coming

380.51 --> 384.37
Cassie Gilmore good servant

384.55 --> 390.68
George Sanford pumpkin Karen B to see

388.28 --> 393.73999999999995
you you probably brought in the trolls

390.68 --> 400.28000000000003
didn't you you're always followed by

393.74 --> 401.93
trolls it's okay Major Tom might be

400.28 --> 409.98999999999995
doubling on people

401.93 --> 409.99
the I Fyodor Dostoevsky 101 rock hound

416.36 --> 427.61
belt and pop yeah let's see you all not

424.699 --> 430.49
Appleton pop not yet usually most of

427.61 --> 434.389
them come leaking in halfway the show

430.49 --> 436.28000000000003
and then yeah they are literally waking

434.389 --> 438.319
up for the debates I don't know why ever

436.28 --> 444.41999999999996
why they all get so obsessed over it

438.319 --> 447.449
it's just yeah

444.42 --> 447.449
[Music]

453.41 --> 456.65000000000003
ridiculous there

459.449 --> 464.259
yeah it's the same guy George Sanford

462.159 --> 467.919
there's a troll a nice spanning sock

464.259 --> 469.569
account so yeah if you recognize him and

467.919 --> 473.19899999999996
he leaves a trade mark every time

469.569 --> 477.24
Advanta because this is a pure troll

473.199 --> 477.24
who's just pissed off for some reason

482.61 --> 495.819
mmm tangerines love them they're the

487.15 --> 500.87899999999996
best reliable and they don't dry out as

495.819 --> 500.879
quickly as other fruits love them

510.249 --> 512.909
yeah

513.59 --> 526.0790000000001
[Music]

515.869 --> 527.999
now a GM at the time and that's good I I

526.079 --> 531.929
don't want him to become purely

527.999 --> 535.589
dependent on me for his food habits you

531.929 --> 540.149
know he has to still be a crow can't

535.589 --> 547.11
start depending for its survival on me

540.149 --> 550.589
giving it good food so I hey thank you

547.11 --> 552.42
brand em for the $2 of cheddar nation

550.589 --> 555.119
glad to see you grow and patreon subs

552.42 --> 557.8499999999999
yeah I haven't checked it out but

555.119 --> 560.85
there's been some movement yeah there's

557.85 --> 566.399
been some new patreon in the last month

560.85 --> 571.879
thank them again let's see what's

566.399 --> 571.879
happened recently I got five now

584.49 --> 592.65
all right yeah yeah gaining wisdom and

589.95 --> 596.1600000000001
it himself I think I shouted him out it

592.65 --> 599.85
was four days ago anyway yeah slowly

596.16 --> 602.99
growing it's great you know because of

599.85 --> 605.82
the steadiness of the of the platform

602.99 --> 608.58
but every little bit helps and

605.82 --> 613.62
eventually the more becomes the more it

608.58 --> 615.69
helps so yeah it's great thank you

613.62 --> 618.75
everyone for subscribing to my patreon

615.69 --> 622.23
and if you have a patreon and you like

618.75 --> 624.93
to support while content makers let's

622.23 --> 627.75
just call it like that and there's a lot

624.93 --> 631.1099999999999
of groups doing that then please

627.75 --> 633.99
yeah consider becoming a patron of mine

631.11 --> 638.22
as well and you can find the link in the

633.99 --> 640.2
description box below and thanks of all

638.22 --> 644.22
the patrons that have supported me so

640.2 --> 649.07
far sheesh what's this guy's obsession

644.22 --> 649.07
with piss holy [Â __Â ]

656.68 --> 664.42
there seems to be a specific theme

659.66 --> 664.42
spawning from this distro

676.8 --> 683.91
yes projecting probably in some way or

680.139 --> 688.1800000000001
he's just like he stumbled upon that and

683.91 --> 690.37
I don't know maybe it triggered some

688.18 --> 694.0889999999999
weird fetish of his so now he's just

690.37 --> 695.74
like ha ha ha ha maniacal about it I

694.089 --> 700.6
don't know there's some really weird

695.74 --> 703.11
people out there you know or maybe it's

700.6 --> 706.3290000000001
Pete Mars I think it's probably P Mars

703.11 --> 709.0600000000001
because he politely asked me can you

706.329 --> 710.8889999999999
please unban me and I asked why and he

709.06 --> 713.8499999999999
didn't even respond to that so he's

710.889 --> 720.88
probably just pissed off that I didn't

713.85 --> 724.74
indulge him could be mistaken though but

720.88 --> 724.74
that's my first guess

725.97 --> 736.22
then don't even waste your time timing

731.849 --> 736.22
about just Benham it's ridiculous

753.39 --> 762.75
a guilty pleasure I don't get that

756.36 --> 764.91
Laurie I really don't get it is it also

762.75 --> 769.92
the problem is I probably do get it it's

764.91 --> 772.4699999999999
just so freaky to see it to experience

769.92 --> 776.91
it from my perspective but understanding

772.47 --> 779.9100000000001
so badly why you guys do that because of

776.91 --> 785.16
just the sheer exposure and having been

779.91 --> 787.4699999999999
a believer myself originally but to you

785.16 --> 790.529
guys it really must be like okay that's

787.47 --> 792.72
just because of your belief there's just

790.529 --> 795.779
certain grounds you can't go and we

792.72 --> 798.57
constantly do that and you just don't

795.779 --> 801.0
understand what you're seeing and

798.57 --> 807.3000000000001
hearing it just it doesn't work it can't

801.0 --> 810.24
match it it can settle because of what

807.3 --> 813.209
your default conscience position is it

810.24 --> 818.61
can't settle and so it must feel like

813.209 --> 820.9799999999999
like a mystery like to you flat earth

818.61 --> 825.36
must be just a giant mystery that you

820.98 --> 827.79
just can't unravel and and that must be

825.36 --> 830.4300000000001
yeah like a guilty pleasure like a

827.79 --> 834.38
puzzle you can never solve but yeah it

830.43 --> 839.9699999999999
does keep people busy apparently and

834.38 --> 842.55
it's so weird because I'm doing that but

839.97 --> 846.99
I totally get all of it and I'm

842.55 --> 850.62
literally working with the material and

846.99 --> 853.47
really trying to figure it out what's

850.62 --> 857.73
going on just by pure data and nobody

853.47 --> 859.5600000000001
can point at me at this point and tell

857.73 --> 863.37
me that I'm a fantasist or anything

859.56 --> 866.51
because I mostly point at data and I'm

863.37 --> 869.25
very careful as to when I try to

866.51 --> 871.22
conceptualize something and what the

869.25 --> 873.839
presuppositions within those

871.22 --> 880.97
conceptualizations are and how you can

873.839 --> 884.48
actually proceed to prove them so

880.97 --> 888.74
I got it figured out guys ballers and

884.48 --> 895.21
well flat-earthers yes but all of them

888.74 --> 899.96
must know B so badly that I'm quite

895.21 --> 902.63
straightforward really you don't need to

899.96 --> 908.7800000000001
follow every single thing I say to just

902.63 --> 911.9
kind of get what I'm about and the

908.78 --> 914.42
problems even behind it that I just kind

911.9 --> 916.37
of publicly showed as to give a more

914.42 --> 919.9699999999999
complete picture as to what you're

916.37 --> 923.42
seeing but the ball is that yeah that's

919.97 --> 927.47
fascinating to them of course but they

923.42 --> 930.16
don't get it because they can't they

927.47 --> 934.28
can't step away from their consciousness

930.16 --> 936.56
perspective that is grounded within the

934.28 --> 939.5799999999999
globe cosmology being true and so much

936.56 --> 939.5799999999999
dependent upon it

960.87 --> 968.86
well like angular data for example

964.829 --> 971.05
constantly addresses to address it we

968.86 --> 974.74
have a lot of angular data concerning

971.05 --> 976.54
the heavenly lights the exact angles and

974.74 --> 980.38
the patterns that they follow it's all

976.54 --> 987.88
been geometrically laid out the angular

980.38 --> 991.57
pattern and then astronomy they build

987.88 --> 993.87
upon that data with a presupposition of

991.57 --> 998.769
foundation layer on top of it

993.87 --> 1002.22
imagining them to be specific things in

998.769 --> 1005.79
a giant eternal realm coordination

1002.22 --> 1008.279
system but yeah and that's all also

1005.79 --> 1011.279
being worked out very carefully so sort

1008.279 --> 1015.51
of careful enough that you could just

1011.279 --> 1017.82
simply get lost in all the data enjoy

1015.51 --> 1020.79
the dream and not really bump into

1017.82 --> 1023.9290000000001
serious issues from that right

1020.79 --> 1026.9389999999999
perspective but if you're actually gonna

1023.929 --> 1029.4189999999999
look at the details yeah it's all of it

1026.939 --> 1029.419
is a mess

1032.72 --> 1039.1390000000001
but that angular data of the heavenly

1035.389 --> 1041.029
bodies and light that is well

1039.139 --> 1044.539
established and it is very fascinating

1041.029 --> 1048.919
data for me to work with because it it's

1044.539 --> 1053.6
like the first orientation data

1048.919 --> 1056.0
concerning the layout of the realm but

1053.6 --> 1058.789
it's not solved yet there's there still

1056.0 --> 1062.48
mysteries to be figured out things that

1058.789 --> 1066.44
even now are so default in being

1062.48 --> 1069.019
presupposed because of just this

1066.44 --> 1071.1200000000001
psychological need of people to have

1069.019 --> 1074.8990000000001
things as straightforward as possible

1071.12 --> 1079.7589999999998
even if it's not entirely confirmed and

1074.899 --> 1085.1789999999999
that is what spawn the literalization of

1079.759 --> 1087.529
the Flat Earth disk for example my

1085.179 --> 1092.539
equations my equations

1087.529 --> 1095.899
you got descriptions I am NOT a guy that

1092.539 --> 1099.399
just keeps a math book for every

1095.899 --> 1104.2099999999998
freaking thing I deal I deal with ok

1099.399 --> 1109.6
math is of minor consequence to what I

1104.21 --> 1109.6000000000001
do it's much more about shaping and

1110.529 --> 1115.639
geometrical consequences just the

1113.029 --> 1119.419
concepts themselves not describing

1115.639 --> 1123.85
things in math it's useless activity to

1119.419 --> 1123.8500000000001
me and I'm not really that good at it I

1123.879 --> 1130.4289999999999
sufficient enough that I can understand

1126.32 --> 1133.6689999999999
the process but I'm not a champion at

1130.429 --> 1134.0590000000002
just doing math or they did gave me a

1133.669 --> 1139.929
headache

1134.059 --> 1139.9289999999999
eventually I don't like it

1140.94 --> 1143.94
yeah

1150.28 --> 1154.16
[Music]

1162.88 --> 1168.029
so anything else concerning the data

1187.19 --> 1190.88
Steve what are you doing

1201.97 --> 1208.419
or am i making a model well in my mind I

1206.139 --> 1213.399
have it pretty much shaped I've even

1208.419 --> 1217.6290000000001
conceptualized the system to literally

1213.399 --> 1220.2689999999998
mold the Earth's surface is based on

1217.629 --> 1227.08
latitude and then to be able to bend it

1220.269 --> 1230.95
around now that will be great like a

1227.08 --> 1233.799
Mashable earth surface system that I

1230.95 --> 1239.169
could work with that could give some

1233.799 --> 1242.7
great visual demonstrations as to the ad

1239.169 --> 1246.49
the looping concept when I try to

1242.7 --> 1249.3400000000001
explain about the orientation for

1246.49 --> 1252.99
example of the equator is it a straight

1249.34 --> 1255.61
line is it a half a circle an arc or

1252.99 --> 1258.82
something in the direction of that or is

1255.61 --> 1265.4189999999999
it a complete circle and yeah literally

1258.82 --> 1269.97
show it as a mold but yet I don't have

1265.419 --> 1269.97
the software for that I have the ideas

1275.43 --> 1281.3700000000001
no no I'm not gonna stop talking piss

1279.13 --> 1281.3700000000001
off

1288.35 --> 1291.4399999999998
[Music]

1292.05 --> 1297.96
Ct it's tea green tea

1298.06 --> 1306.4299999999998
[Music]

1300.96 --> 1309.15
Sencha organic I really like it

1306.43 --> 1309.15
it's healthy

1313.32 --> 1323.57
made with filtered water ceramic

1316.98 --> 1330.4
filtered water like a fresh spring

1323.57 --> 1333.509
cooked in an electric cooker that's it

1330.4 --> 1333.509
[Music]

1341.759 --> 1345.869
what are you talking about kamikaze

1344.049 --> 1349.9189999999999
Gilmore

1345.869 --> 1354.1789999999999
yes yes Emperor Palpatine my model is

1349.919 --> 1354.179
falsifiable that is correct

1363.72 --> 1372.15
in multiple ways I already shared that

1369.08 --> 1374.6599999999999
it's all about the orientation of the

1372.15 --> 1374.66
equator

1378.11 --> 1385.4699999999998
if the equator lined that that apparent

1382.95 --> 1388.2
correlation of the sun's orientation

1385.47 --> 1392.69
over the Earth's surface if that is

1388.2 --> 1397.98
anything but a literal closed circle

1392.69 --> 1401.73
literal physical circle then there is

1397.98 --> 1403.8
just a great chance of either spatial

1401.73 --> 1408.08
non-linearity going on within the realm

1403.8 --> 1412.94
or a definitive looping factor

1408.08 --> 1412.9399999999998
absolutely falsifiable absolutely

1424.14 --> 1429.22
yeah no [Â __Â ] I should try to falsified

1427.09 --> 1439.23
with tests but yeah that takes quite an

1429.22 --> 1444.549
expedition I actually have to follow

1439.23 --> 1450.04
those the equator literally and measure

1444.549 --> 1452.2
up how you're moving very precisely this

1450.04 --> 1454.03
is quite an expedition to do that to do

1452.2 --> 1457.78
it for real and not just as a

1454.03 --> 1461.98
preliminary test that's not gonna be any

1457.78 --> 1464.32
substantial proof so yeah if you don't

1461.98 --> 1466.35
mind I'm not prepared to do that right

1464.32 --> 1466.35
now

1470.549 --> 1477.429
besides doing it completely on my own

1472.9 --> 1479.679
seems kind of insane such a fast

1477.429 --> 1483.8700000000001
expedition you can't do such thing just

1479.679 --> 1486.49
on your own maybe in novels you could

1483.87 --> 1488.59
but in the real world they are you

1486.49 --> 1492.13
definitely gonna need a team for us for

1488.59 --> 1494.85
such big big endeavors that are

1492.13 --> 1494.8500000000001
sensitive

1496.92 --> 1500.15
[Music]

1505.33 --> 1509.28
insult generator Wow

1515.42 --> 1523.5800000000002
so yeah thank you for the questions by

1519.0 --> 1525.75
the way it's a I very much appreciate it

1523.58 --> 1529.1399999999999
because it's a whole lot better than

1525.75 --> 1532.19
these stupid trolls just snowing under

1529.14 --> 1532.19
my freaking chat

1574.5 --> 1588.799
no Philip Cooper it's ridiculous this is

1585.059 --> 1588.799
not the equator region

1629.17 --> 1631.8600000000001
yeah

1633.919 --> 1637.249
let's see

1652.14 --> 1654.7700000000002
yep

1656.87 --> 1662.2099999999998
to be careful

1659.33 --> 1664.749
now there are some political situational

1662.21 --> 1667.999
issues that are very confusing to me

1664.749 --> 1670.159
like I'm seeing them from multiple

1667.999 --> 1679.6100000000001
angles and it's really tough to make out

1670.159 --> 1684.429
what to make of the situation involves a

1679.61 --> 1687.7099999999998
certain city state somewhere in the East

1684.429 --> 1691.1000000000001
it's just very confusing as to what is

1687.71 --> 1692.779
that who is doing what because it seems

1691.1 --> 1695.7199999999998
like things are going out of control

1692.779 --> 1698.6
there and Wars me greatly but I am

1695.72 --> 1703.19
getting disorientated as to like who is

1698.6 --> 1712.9599999999998
doing what and why are things

1703.19 --> 1712.96
aggravating so much anyway

1718.07 --> 1721.2
[Music]

1747.6 --> 1754.8
and other than that yeah man crazy

1751.78 --> 1754.8
liberal nnessee

1755.28 --> 1768.87
anybody see that that weird clip or aoc

1762.45 --> 1773.01
just started promoting was it

1768.87 --> 1779.02
vampire [Â __Â ] like what the [Â __Â ]

1773.01 --> 1790.87
creepy as hell like what is going on why

1779.02 --> 1793.59
won't you do that holy [Â __Â ] my chat

1790.87 --> 1793.59
broken or something

1796.24 --> 1799.08
yeah

1799.76 --> 1806.81
that's weird not the big chat but the

1803.69 --> 1809.3
the regular YouTube chat was broken for

1806.81 --> 1814.57
some reason I missed out doing a lot of

1809.3 --> 1814.57
things you were saying sorry about that

1823.85 --> 1830.33
yeah yeah Philip Cooper I know I know

1827.06 --> 1833.27
it's so lovely I know I remember it from

1830.33 --> 1835.52
the early days it can rent lists full

1833.27 --> 1838.49
days when we didn't understand all your

1835.52 --> 1842.03
presuppositions yet and you're still

1838.49 --> 1845.06
thought you had an argument yeah but on

1842.03 --> 1846.92
the sphere that circle in a straight

1845.06 --> 1850.52
line blah blah blah yeah it's very very

1846.92 --> 1852.5900000000001
very nice but that's not proof because

1850.52 --> 1855.83
you're just presupposing it's a sphere

1852.59 --> 1859.79
and there's still no curvature to

1855.83 --> 1864.6499999999999
actually allow you to use that as some

1859.79 --> 1867.32
kind of proof everybody knows by now

1864.65 --> 1873.47
that the horizon is not the leading edge

1867.32 --> 1877.1
of a sphere it's an optical effect where

1873.47 --> 1881.21
the sky meets the ground apparently with

1877.1 --> 1883.73
Mirage effects beyond and then

1881.21 --> 1885.92
eventually nothing because of a lack of

1883.73 --> 1889.07
air clarity that will obstruct further

1885.92 --> 1891.53
view so it is not curvature that and

1889.07 --> 1896.75
boats definitely do not go over the

1891.53 --> 1906.98
curve they simply disappear beyond the

1896.75 --> 1910.51
horizon and sometimes they don't so he

1906.98 --> 1910.51
has not much of an argument really

1917.71 --> 1927.16
okay insult general nobody delete that

1920.23 --> 1932.3700000000001
that's actually kind of funny Michael

1927.16 --> 1932.3700000000001
O'Rourke damn it

1946.27 --> 1951.07
right I thought it was kind of funny

1948.5 --> 1951.07
what he said

1951.8 --> 1959.5
[Music]

1954.37 --> 1962.9499999999998
because he's basically mark praising my

1959.5 --> 1965.59
intellect so it seems but he doesn't

1962.95 --> 1969.549
actually give any kind of information

1965.59 --> 1972.6689999999999
within the mock set up where it's proven

1969.549 --> 1976.96
that I'm not smart so in a way it's kind

1972.669 --> 1982.8090000000002
of a covert compliment it's weird

1976.96 --> 1984.73
I thought it was interesting I'll just

1982.809 --> 1986.98
spell it out you know this these kind of

1984.73 --> 1989.47
things are interesting aberrations of

1986.98 --> 1992.799
personal behavior to me so what he said

1989.47 --> 1995.44
in SOL generator Arwen thinks he's smart

1992.799 --> 1999.429
Arwen is speaking in a few levels above

1995.44 --> 2004.76
the median that excuse the supremacy of

1999.429 --> 2007.02
his intellect hahaha smiley with tears

2004.76 --> 2012.84
ahaha intellect

2007.02 --> 2016.25
now that's a good troll so yeah I don't

2012.84 --> 2016.25
know I think that's interesting

2021.99 --> 2028.11
anyway yeah proceeded in the bedding I

2029.85 --> 2040.2099999999998
know it was just a timing issue mica or

2032.98 --> 2043.809
don't worry about it there's a slight

2040.21 --> 2046.71
delay between when I speak and when you

2043.809 --> 2046.71
get to see itself

2062.129 --> 2072.819
really NASA trolling that's cool so I

2067.77 --> 2077.77
make it so much more amusing for you to

2072.819 --> 2080.98
be so dumb thank you I guess in that

2077.77 --> 2084.22
sense it's not a waste of effort after

2080.98 --> 2088.379
all now at least I can make your

2084.22 --> 2088.379
stupidity more amusing to you

2106.77 --> 2109.94
[Music]

2111.32 --> 2114.2200000000003
okay

2117.359 --> 2125.13
but how how exactly you you've put out

2122.73 --> 2128.069
quite a few sentences right there

2125.13 --> 2132.38
but in it you haven't really said

2128.069 --> 2132.38
anything to disprove it

2132.63 --> 2140.15
you're just saying oh it's so dumb it's

2135.42 --> 2143.039
so dumb it's so dumb but what exactly

2140.15 --> 2148.2000000000003
why don't you point at the actual

2143.039 --> 2150.63
stupidity of mine and mention it so

2148.2 --> 2152.7889999999998
people can see what you're suppose that

2150.63 --> 2157.609
claim of stupidity really is instead of

2152.789 --> 2161.69
just blabbering on about nothing

2157.609 --> 2161.69
pretending to be very confident

2169.08 --> 2175.0989999999997
huh

2170.96 --> 2177.5
okay John Bernards yeah sure I've

2175.099 --> 2182.3
personally experienced moonlight being

2177.5 --> 2184.819
cooler I like yeah in the nights

2182.3 --> 2187.76
especially when it's very clear and cold

2184.819 --> 2190.7599999999998
and I go smoking on the balcony and

2187.76 --> 2193.5200000000004
there's a moon out if I stand under that

2190.76 --> 2195.7700000000004
moon yeah I'm gonna freakin freeze up as

2193.52 --> 2197.839
I smoke so what I do then is stand

2195.77 --> 2199.819
around the corner where I'm in the

2197.839 --> 2202.2799999999997
shadow of the Moon and then suddenly

2199.819 --> 2211.369
it's a whole lot more pleasant and I

2202.28 --> 2218.03
don't freeze up so just yeah to me it's

2211.369 --> 2224.38
kind of obvious and I've done tests with

2218.03 --> 2228.3190000000004
actual thermometers what is it it's now

2224.38 --> 2233.059
pretty long ago you have ten years ago

2228.319 --> 2235.91
or something for buddy and yeah it was

2233.059 --> 2238.94
different but yeah we didn't record

2235.91 --> 2240.5789999999997
anything and kind of doing it in the

2238.94 --> 2242.9900000000002
background

2240.579 --> 2246.02
weren't really ready to come forward

2242.99 --> 2248.3289999999997
with that on YouTube or anything but

2246.02 --> 2253.25
yeah that that's what I've experienced

2248.329 --> 2256.809
and that's it I have no conclusive

2253.25 --> 2256.809
evidence that I can present

2268.49 --> 2279.58
eat buddy all right our our regularly

2275.08 --> 2281.839
what is that discerning for I am

2279.58 --> 2286.7599999999998
astronomically fascinated with your

2281.839 --> 2291.43
opinions life with all relished your

2286.76 --> 2291.4300000000003
channel and gave you a sub okay

2292.119 --> 2295.7200000000003
righty dokie

2305.22 --> 2311.52
that sounds very pseudo-intellectual of

2308.13 --> 2313.26
you because still besides using slightly

2311.52 --> 2316.5
more complicated words you haven't

2313.26 --> 2319.2000000000003
actually said anything nasa trolling

2316.5 --> 2326.88
although i did I do appreciate the the

2319.2 --> 2328.47
subbing sure no problem with that but

2326.88 --> 2332.849
yeah you still haven't provide any

2328.47 --> 2338.0989999999997
specifics on exactly what it is you

2332.849 --> 2340.4100000000003
claim is dumb about me yeah but you're

2338.099 --> 2341.94
not actually highlighting in you're just

2340.41 --> 2347.0099999999998
saying you're doing you're not

2341.94 --> 2350.819
highlighting anything what is it do it

2347.01 --> 2355.28
come on come on NASA trolling present my

2350.819 --> 2355.2799999999997
stupidity to me come on do it

2361.74 --> 2371.39
yeah

2363.589 --> 2375.349
that's funny but exactly what is it that

2371.39 --> 2378.3799999999997
provides the proof for your covert claim

2375.349 --> 2381.17
of me being stupid really are not so

2378.38 --> 2385.339
covered eventually what what is it what

2381.17 --> 2391.4
did i do what did I say so wrong yeah

2385.339 --> 2393.589
this is kind of pathetic I'm Alma I'm

2391.4 --> 2396.13
kind of disappointed you should have at

2393.589 --> 2399.709
least be able to try something I know

2396.13 --> 2401.719
things about me that are stupid don't

2399.709 --> 2406.029
you haven't you even paid enough

2401.719 --> 2410.839
attention to notice these things come on

2406.029 --> 2413.93
no way please oh are you trying to

2410.839 --> 2424.459
intimidate me without any arguments that

2413.93 --> 2427.0389999999998
is so overconfidence yeah I think I

2424.459 --> 2429.2889999999998
think the guys probably just tried out

2427.039 --> 2432.679
some new medication and it had kind of

2429.289 --> 2435.429
an expected manic side effects so it's

2432.679 --> 2435.429
just going nuts

2439.67 --> 2444.85
am i anywhere close necessarily probably

2443.96 --> 2447.85
a man or not

2444.85 --> 2447.85
hmm

2477.52 --> 2480.67
[Music]

2481.12 --> 2489.3399999999997
well to be fair Mario knows it's flat a

2485.44 --> 2491.71
lot of things that everyone also flat

2489.34 --> 2495.1000000000004
earthers and even yet halfway decent

2491.71 --> 2497.91
people say in chats and on the Internet

2495.1 --> 2500.83
I think most of them wouldn't say that

2497.91 --> 2503.56
those things on the level of energy that

2500.83 --> 2505.98
they do normally on the Internet to be

2503.56 --> 2505.98
fair

2523.48 --> 2526.11
yeah

2529.04 --> 2534.81
even I look I can get rude and trollish

2532.26 --> 2538.7000000000003
I don't do that

2534.81 --> 2544.62
in the real world I'm actually

2538.7 --> 2546.6299999999997
neurotically polite really in the real

2544.62 --> 2550.71
world you'll have to push me hard to

2546.63 --> 2554.21
start misbehaving or I gotta be honest

2550.71 --> 2554.21
um severe pressure and

2568.79 --> 2575.29
why why are you asking Jonesy oddity I

2572.51 --> 2579.55
have no idea

2575.29 --> 2579.55
are you expecting something to happen

2582.33 --> 2585.389
[Music]

2590.46 --> 2596.62
right Major Tom yeah it's a sensible

2593.56 --> 2608.0099999999998
question there's really experimentation

2596.62 --> 2608.0099999999998
I think yeah figuring out optics

2608.55 --> 2617.17
that's all it a solid model a basic

2613.36 --> 2620.77
model for how optics work from a

2617.17 --> 2624.01
personal perspective how it looks like

2620.77 --> 2628.33
the optical slant and the Mirage in zone

2624.01 --> 2630.61
Beyond and the linear obstruction or the

2628.33 --> 2636.31
linear concealment rate of it into the

2630.61 --> 2639.31
distance all that I think that is yeah

2636.31 --> 2643.36
really it's been good

2639.31 --> 2648.22
figuring that out as a solid foundation

2643.36 --> 2651.57
to dispel the claim of curvature very in

2648.22 --> 2651.5699999999997
great detail

2660.28 --> 2663.4500000000003
why did you do that

2678.7 --> 2683.9399999999996
all right god

2684.0 --> 2691.77
come on Asset Charles down don't get all

2686.9 --> 2694.619
[Â __Â ] nonsense into this don't got PJ

2691.77 --> 2698.869
on us I thought it was kind of a half

2694.619 --> 2698.869
way amusing you're trying to throw me

2701.62 --> 2704.71
[Music]

2713.869 --> 2725.17
Yeah right gleam indeed but just he

2717.079 --> 2725.17
doesn't even know it just doesn't know

2730.01 --> 2738.8300000000004
which is silly because everybody has

2734.63 --> 2741.77
their flaws so the only reason for you

2738.83 --> 2745.7799999999997
not to know is for basically not having

2741.77 --> 2750.65
paid attention and just making stupid

2745.78 --> 2752.0
out their claims without any real

2750.65 --> 2756.56
backing because you haven't actually

2752.0 --> 2763.27
looked into any of it it's very childish

2756.56 --> 2763.27
behavior they're not very effective

2765.22 --> 2770.5589999999997
you're only gonna end up being

2767.16 --> 2774.52
humiliated even though your face is not

2770.559 --> 2777.8190000000004
revealed your essence is tied into your

2774.52 --> 2781.24
actions into that soccer count or

2777.819 --> 2787.21
whatever it is and it's gonna reflect on

2781.24 --> 2790.6499999999996
you even though we don't know literally

2787.21 --> 2790.65
your identity it doesn't matter

2819.54 --> 2823.16
yeah he's spiraling

2829.19 --> 2834.799
Yeah right I know emperor palpatine if

2832.7 --> 2836.75
he's gonna go out of control and just

2834.799 --> 2839.119
start yeah

2836.75 --> 2841.039
increasing the severity level of his

2839.119 --> 2845.809
attacks getting more and more

2841.039 --> 2848.03
unreasonable and hostile then yeah I'll

2845.809 --> 2852.9700000000003
just bad name eventually but I don't

2848.03 --> 2852.9700000000003
know so far it's been kind of just funny

2869.98 --> 2881.02
oh you were emperor palpatine surprise

2875.56 --> 2883.0299999999997

there are so many yeah obviously people

3093.809 --> 3098.789
probably you know maybe even person that

3096.93 --> 3101.609
just hang around

3098.789 --> 3104.219
Nathan Oakley trolling their asses off

3101.609 --> 3107.0989999999997
all the time so you kind of been

3104.219 --> 3110.279
associated but don't take that as a sign

3107.099 --> 3113.839
to go out trying to get gay dates in

3110.279 --> 3113.839

3210.68 --> 3215.3289999999997
you gleam maybe you should just leave

3212.599 --> 3217.869
NASA mindset alone it seems like he's

3215.329 --> 3222.7400000000002
literally now gone into some weird

3217.869 --> 3224.03
talking to himself spiral because just

3222.74 --> 3225.7099999999996
look at what he's saying that makes a

3224.03 --> 3228.8190000000004
lot of sense if he's literally talking

3225.71 --> 3228.819
to himself at this point

3239.04 --> 3245.04
and he plans for the rant ECAM yeah of

help for that NASA mindset and I'm

3289.57 --> 3297.9100000000003
serious I'm starting to get a little

3293.26 --> 3302.55
worried about the type of words you're

grafting into your sentences there

3312.77 --> 3317.56

solution for you as well get help

we can do for you here you just need to

3340.2 --> 3348.5099999999998
find it somewhere else because yeah it
