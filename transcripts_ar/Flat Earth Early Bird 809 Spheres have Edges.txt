it's still very hot

154.84 --> 157.84
ah

163.599 --> 171.83999999999997
right so yesterday

167.04 --> 171.84
i don't know i uh

173.76 --> 178.79999999999998
had a pretty laid back day yesterday

178.959 --> 184.8
do i add homie to your tea no

182.0 --> 188.08
i don't no i just drink it as is i don't

184.8 --> 188.08
add any sugar to it

188.72 --> 191.35999999999999
any sort

196.319 --> 203.51899999999998
it's just green tea i do put

200.319 --> 207.83999999999997
a cane regular uh

203.519 --> 207.84
organic cane sugar in my coffee though

208.239 --> 213.12
that's about it add honey just for the

212.4 --> 215.59900000000002
health part

213.12 --> 217.04
part of it okay well if if that works

215.599 --> 227.83999999999997
out for you

217.04 --> 227.84
because it's still sugar you know

238.84 --> 242.959
um oh man

240.959 --> 244.799
yesterday went pretty much the same as

242.959 --> 248.4
uh

244.799 --> 250.64000000000001
as monday from my part

248.4 --> 252.239
and so i missed i think i missed out on

250.64 --> 253.439
the complete after show again but i

252.239 --> 257.84000000000003
heard it was pretty good

253.439 --> 257.84
and rumpus got in there again apparently

259.12 --> 262.479
i myself was not that

263.12 --> 272.08
not that contributing yesterday

268.8 --> 274.56
i think i spoke up about once

272.08 --> 274.56
that's it

275.12 --> 279.36
but yeah i can't be active every single

277.759 --> 280.88
day in a flatter debate it comes and

279.36 --> 284.32
goes

280.88 --> 284.32
hey hello that flat fellow

287.44 --> 293.199
right i did actually listen back to my

290.479 --> 294.96
show from yesterday

293.199 --> 297.84000000000003
from beginning to end and i thought it

294.96 --> 297.84
was pretty good

301.12 --> 305.44
so it yeah it it's kind of better than

305.12 --> 308.84000000000003
it

305.44 --> 312.56
seemed to me as i was doing it

308.84 --> 315.919
weird oh that works out

312.56 --> 319.84
but yeah my show is pretty decent

315.919 --> 323.52
even though i am yeah not

319.84 --> 327.11999999999995
like rolling out ace oh a

323.52 --> 330.32
a steady media program of any sort i'm

327.12 --> 330.32
basically improvising

330.72 --> 334.47900000000004
but it's still very entertaining

337.44 --> 340.639
and yeah you have this ability to

339.84 --> 343.44
basically hop

340.639 --> 344.88
on a subject pretty quickly if it's

343.44 --> 353.84
brought up

344.88 --> 353.84
and that works out just fine

356.0 --> 361.039
but uh yeah other than that infowars

359.28 --> 364.4
still apparently in the middle of a

361.039 --> 367.84
snowstorm and there was some uploads

364.4 --> 367.84
there was no live program

371.28 --> 374.79999999999995
and yeah so i continued just watching my

373.36 --> 378.0
own show

374.8 --> 379.84000000000003
and the rest of the evening played

378.0 --> 381.919
yeah i've been playing game been playing

379.84 --> 385.59999999999997
balls gate 3 some more

381.919 --> 388.96
discovered some new territories in there

385.6 --> 391.52000000000004
with like very high difficulty

388.96 --> 391.52
but yeah

392.56 --> 396.96
it's it it keeps on being interesting

400.4 --> 404.71999999999997
oh aaron armstrong why don't you look in

403.28 --> 406.96
the chat

404.72 --> 409.199
on screen and see if you're still

406.96 --> 413.44
blocked

409.199 --> 418.16
that's just dumb thing to say come on

413.44 --> 420.84
uh also i updated the chat rules

418.16 --> 422.24
and now added in the rule about the

420.84 --> 425.67999999999995
hagglers

422.24 --> 428.479
if i address you you'll have to actually

425.68 --> 429.44
respond if you don't then i will kick

428.479 --> 432.479
you

429.44 --> 437.84
right so that's now

432.479 --> 437.84
updated this is in the description box

448.16 --> 452.16
it's not dumb at all well i think it is

450.16 --> 454.88000000000005
dummy i think it's dumb to say am i

452.16 --> 454.88000000000005
still blocked

455.759 --> 465.84000000000003
but you can check that yourself

466.56 --> 470.16
you used to be able to comment

470.56 --> 476.56
yeah and then i blocked you and then you

472.96 --> 476.56
speak up and then you can see

476.8 --> 482.8
in the text right there you can see it

480.72 --> 484.47900000000004
that your name is there so to actually

482.8 --> 487.199
ask if you're blocked

484.479 --> 487.919
is kind of stupid because you could just

487.199 --> 491.199
keep

487.919 --> 492.0
yeah have the only seven watching see it

491.199 --> 495.36
pop up and then

492.0 --> 495.36
you know it's there

497.68 --> 504.0
and i'm not a bit cranky

501.199 --> 507.44
i'm just pointing it out to you you're

504.0 --> 509.36
not the only one

507.44 --> 511.84
right there's more people coming in my

509.36 --> 514.24
chat am i still blog

511.84 --> 521.8389999999999
instead of just typing something out and

514.24 --> 521.839
then watching it for themselves

538.24 --> 542.8
how you been yeah i mean i've been doing

546.839 --> 549.839
okay

556.0 --> 564.56
new hairstyle nah not necessarily i just

560.72 --> 568.08
i i put my hair loose

564.56 --> 571.279
loose more regularly

568.08 --> 573.279
it's also better for my hair i think

571.279 --> 574.88
but i i pretty much only do this for the

573.279 --> 575.68
show because when i go outside i

574.88 --> 580.72
definitely

575.68 --> 582.399
put it in a in the pigtail setup

580.72 --> 591.839
because otherwise it's just gonna blow

582.399 --> 591.839
in my face constantly

602.839 --> 605.839
so

607.6 --> 614.72
yeah the games

610.72 --> 614.72
bit of south park watching

615.92 --> 621.92
i'm over season like

619.04 --> 621.92
15 already

623.839 --> 630.8800000000001
and i'm still just amazed by like

627.36 --> 632.9590000000001
what is in south park all of it

630.88 --> 634.16
and it's pretty astounding also because

632.959 --> 636.56
there were just

634.16 --> 637.519
things and details that the shows were

636.56 --> 639.4399999999999
about

637.519 --> 641.2
that when they first came out i didn't

639.44 --> 646.0
really understand them

641.2 --> 649.6
and now watching back now i understand

646.0 --> 649.6
like they were really

650.88 --> 657.519
putting out psychological

654.0 --> 659.6
things about basically regular human

657.519 --> 662.88
beings about the sheep

659.6 --> 665.76
how they typically respond and stuff

662.88 --> 668.32
and then put it in an absurdistic way

665.76 --> 671.36
slightly to make it funny

668.32 --> 674.88
but all those things are all

671.36 --> 677.44
happening out there still

674.88 --> 680.64
so yeah it's very revealing to to what

677.44 --> 680.6400000000001
south park it really is

681.6 --> 685.36
also some of the story arcs are building

685.04 --> 690.64
up

685.36 --> 690.64
like halfway the entire series

692.079 --> 696.3199999999999
and some of those episodes they kind of

694.32 --> 699.0400000000001
hit pretty hard in ways

696.32 --> 700.8000000000001
so there's this moment at some point

699.04 --> 704.079
where

700.8 --> 707.5999999999999
or like stan goes through

704.079 --> 709.04
like sort of a divorce situation at home

707.6 --> 712.399
and everything and it's all

709.04 --> 716.0
pointed out and they even draw in

712.399 --> 718.24
sort of a matrix analogy but yeah they

716.0 --> 719.2
it it's a very convoluted and

718.24 --> 722.24
complicated

719.2 --> 722.24
episode that one

722.56 --> 727.4399999999999
basically about cynicism but

725.6 --> 729.36
at some point in your life you might

727.44 --> 732.5600000000001
just start to

729.36 --> 735.76
see everything like it's shitty and

732.56 --> 736.7199999999999
like that that episode got very close to

735.76 --> 739.519
heart

736.72 --> 740.0790000000001
like really close to heart because i i

739.519 --> 743.36
pretty much

740.079 --> 746.3199999999999
in my way went through that

743.36 --> 748.0
almost all of it like i went through a

746.32 --> 751.839
divorce situation

748.0 --> 755.92
for my parents although it was later

751.839 --> 758.0
like yeah my parents were always having

755.92 --> 758.959
issues with one another one way or the

758.0 --> 762.079
other it was always

758.959 --> 765.4399999999999
something right and

762.079 --> 767.8389999999999
so yeah stan's parents and his entire

765.44 --> 768.399
situation just reminds me a lot about

767.839 --> 770.24
myself

768.399 --> 772.56
in a whole lot of ways it gets very

770.24 --> 775.839
close and this one especially

772.56 --> 779.3599999999999
because it kind of in a way did

775.839 --> 781.6800000000001
to me describes like things that i've

779.36 --> 784.399
been through

781.68 --> 784.959
how i like to see it and then it shows

784.399 --> 788.639
this

784.959 --> 791.1199999999999
the episode shows you like from a very

788.639 --> 794.24
cynical perspective basically what it

791.12 --> 797.44
is what that is

794.24 --> 799.519
what the like hopping onto the idea of

797.44 --> 801.839
the matrix

799.519 --> 805.6
and kind of deciding to be outside and

801.839 --> 807.6800000000001
what it does what it can do to your mind

805.6 --> 809.2
how you can become a total safanye

807.68 --> 812.88
because of it and all and it's

809.2 --> 812.88
very much expressed in there

813.6 --> 817.9200000000001
so yeah it's personal reflections

824.32 --> 828.72
years ago you thought you got it yeah i

826.32 --> 832.0
did get a ticket what happened

828.72 --> 834.88
well i paid the ticket and then i didn't

832.0 --> 834.88
do that anymore

838.639 --> 843.839
if i watched jericho no i have not

848.32 --> 853.36
especially if it's something new

851.36 --> 854.399
i haven't been watching a lot of netflix

853.36 --> 856.24
recently

854.399 --> 857.76
just been watching south park more and

856.24 --> 871.839
more

857.76 --> 871.8389999999999
netflix not so much

877.12 --> 885.839
it's older but it's good i i have heard

879.44 --> 885.839
about it

899.519 --> 906.079
maybe tom parker maybe i'd like it

903.12 --> 907.44
it's just that i don't know man a lot of

906.079 --> 913.8389999999999
biblical themed

907.44 --> 913.839
things in media out there

919.279 --> 927.8389999999999
i'm just not super interested

930.8 --> 941.8389999999999
on average i'm much more interested in

932.56 --> 941.8389999999999
what paula has to say bible literally

946.03 --> 949.25
[Music]

949.68 --> 953.4399999999999
it's not about religion okay

953.519 --> 959.729
i don't remember what it is

956.6 --> 959.729
[Music]

967.6 --> 972.639
okay more about what we're dealing with

970.399 --> 972.639
now

980.839 --> 983.839
hmm

989.68 --> 994.079
nuclear attack all right i think i

994.839 --> 997.839
remember

1001.92 --> 1005.519
yeah we're not really dealing with that

1004.24 --> 1007.199
now though

1005.519 --> 1009.519
nobody's ever dealing with a nuclear

1007.199 --> 1012.639
attack that only happy

1009.519 --> 1012.639
happens in the movies

1017.36 --> 1024.0
all right by the way little detail

1020.399 --> 1027.36
about the netherlands it's pretty

1024.0 --> 1027.36
freaky actually because

1027.679 --> 1035.1200000000001
yesterday apparently there was

1031.039 --> 1035.12
a situation right

1035.439 --> 1038.559
where the dutch court basically sided

1038.0 --> 1043.039
with

1038.559 --> 1045.6789999999999
activists that were against the lockdown

1043.039 --> 1046.079
and they actually yeah gave them that

1045.679 --> 1048.0
like

1046.079 --> 1052.08
this the activist one like there was

1048.0 --> 1057.679
even a separate article about it

1052.08 --> 1060.1599999999999
rt but then this morning i watched

1057.679 --> 1061.2
onto we have been looking through rt

1060.16 --> 1064.0800000000002
again

1061.2 --> 1064.0800000000002
and apparently

1064.24 --> 1068.799
yeah that very same decision was not too

1066.72 --> 1073.57
long afterward

1068.799 --> 1076.78
was overturned it's like what the hell

1073.57 --> 1076.78
[Music]

1077.84 --> 1083.1999999999998
so yeah almost thought like oh finally

1080.64 --> 1088.3200000000002
some of this [ __ ] gonna end

1083.2 --> 1088.32
but then they basically undid that

1088.72 --> 1095.84
it's almost like a fake out like what

1090.72 --> 1095.84
what is this

1104.83 --> 1124.08
[Music]

1106.64 --> 1124.0800000000002
maybe i'll read into some of that all

1134.84 --> 1137.84
right

1148.84 --> 1151.84
oh

1178.72 --> 1182.96
an appellate panel i don't know

1183.12 --> 1187.84
maybe uh like sleeping warrior could

1186.0 --> 1189.52
help me make some sense of what actually

1187.84 --> 1192.3999999999999
happened in there

1189.52 --> 1194.16
but yeah the articles do basically put

1192.4 --> 1194.799
out the basics of it i don't know how

1194.16 --> 1198.559
that

1194.799 --> 1198.559
can even be possible like that

1201.76 --> 1204.84
that there would be like an emergency

1203.84 --> 1209.4399999999998
court panel

1204.84 --> 1213.4399999999998
just overturning it pretty much

1209.44 --> 1216.559
last minute what was earlier decided

1213.44 --> 1216.559
like it pretty bizarre

1218.24 --> 1221.84
and disappointing

1226.44 --> 1229.569
[Music]

1229.6 --> 1235.4399999999998
so yeah we'll see how that progresses

1233.12 --> 1249.84
i'll keep i'll try to keep an eye out on

1235.44 --> 1249.8400000000001
that situation

1253.44 --> 1259.919
right so yeah i am up and open for the

1257.36 --> 1262.9599999999998
next one a half hour

1259.919 --> 1265.2
for any kind of communication or subject

1262.96 --> 1265.2
so

1268.4 --> 1274.3200000000002
if anybody else is out there

1271.84 --> 1276.72
beside that flat fellow and aaron

1274.32 --> 1291.84
armstrong and tom parker then please

1276.72 --> 1291.84
speak up in chat that would be great

1295.52 --> 1305.84
huh hello tara 306 good to see you

1313.28 --> 1317.84
texas cold record and millions without

1315.36 --> 1318.3999999999999
power yes yeah i have followed that

1317.84 --> 1320.0
little

1318.4 --> 1322.88
through infowars there were some

1320.0 --> 1324.72
uploaded reports there

1322.88 --> 1329.0390000000002
and there's apparently this whole

1324.72 --> 1333.84
situation going on that's quite insane

1329.039 --> 1333.84
with the power

1335.28 --> 1339.9189999999999
it is crazy to just have the power

1337.919 --> 1341.1200000000001
completely blacked out when it's that

1339.919 --> 1347.1200000000001
cold that is really

1341.12 --> 1349.9189999999999
just bad it's really bad situation

1347.12 --> 1361.84
and you would have to wonder like how

1349.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
did it even get to that point

1369.28 --> 1372.6399999999999
right so these blackouts like why is

1372.32 --> 1374.32
that

1372.64 --> 1378.24
is that because lines are cut or

1374.32 --> 1378.24
anything or is it just because

1379.12 --> 1383.28
like these what is it the coal power

1382.159 --> 1385.2
plants that

1383.28 --> 1387.039
that they typically use in the winter

1385.2 --> 1390.559
for power

1387.039 --> 1394.4
they just turned off so

1390.559 --> 1398.08
basically yeah however that's arranged

1394.4 --> 1398.0800000000002
windmills frozen right so

1398.72 --> 1405.039
yeah when when when the the

1402.159 --> 1406.0800000000002
environmentally friendly power

1405.039 --> 1408.32
provisions

1406.08 --> 1410.799
falter which can happen due to

1408.32 --> 1413.84
environmental circumstances

1410.799 --> 1416.48
then there should be an alternative

1413.84 --> 1417.28
emergency option open which yeah coal

1416.48 --> 1421.2
plants

1417.28 --> 1423.9189999999999
that would be great so why aren't they

1421.2 --> 1423.919
firing up

1424.24 --> 1428.0
to undo the blackout it's absolutely

1426.559 --> 1431.12
ridiculous

1428.0 --> 1435.12
it's totally irresponsible

1431.12 --> 1438.7199999999998
like in this case like

1435.12 --> 1441.4399999999998
certain individuals over there

1438.72 --> 1443.1200000000001
if somebody's keeping it like that then

1441.44 --> 1445.039
there should be people fired and

1443.12 --> 1459.84
potentially even

1445.039 --> 1459.84
like sued over that

1463.279 --> 1470.159
why why do you keep asking that dmk 2020

1466.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
why why would you say that

1470.159 --> 1487.8400000000001
i think it's funny for some reason

1488.0 --> 1495.679
i i don't see it you know eric debay is

1491.84 --> 1499.6
literally on the other side of the realm

1495.679 --> 1500.4
so why why is he supposedly here and

1499.6 --> 1504.559
it's

1500.4 --> 1508.5590000000002
just silly why why do you say that

1504.559 --> 1508.559
hey guns have never owned r p

1509.679 --> 1512.799
hey did you change your name back

1511.52 --> 1516.08
thought you were gonna

1512.799 --> 1516.08
be called robert b

1526.24 --> 1531.2
and george sanford hello by the way rob

1528.96 --> 1531.2
h

1532.72 --> 1539.279
no just asking well no no d damn

1535.76 --> 1542.64
k 2020 no of course eric debase not here

1539.279 --> 1546.4
if eric debay was here if i'd actually

1542.64 --> 1548.7990000000002
meet him for the first time face to face

1546.4 --> 1550.64
yeah i'll share it on the show don't

1548.799 --> 1551.9189999999999
worry about it you know if something

1550.64 --> 1554.4
actually happens

1551.919 --> 1555.5200000000002
that relates in any way to flat earth or

1554.4 --> 1558.5590000000002
the scene

1555.52 --> 1562.8799999999999
you'll know right so it's just

1558.559 --> 1571.84
completely stupid to keep on asking that

1562.88 --> 1571.8400000000001
why would you assume that

1582.84 --> 1585.84
so

1594.08 --> 1598.08
right yeah well tom parker look it

1596.32 --> 1600.96
doesn't deserve to be timed out

1598.08 --> 1602.1589999999999
for something like that i just i just

1600.96 --> 1604.72
don't get it

1602.159 --> 1605.2
because he's not the first one to ask

1604.72 --> 1607.52
that

1605.2 --> 1610.159
other people have to in the past it's

1607.52 --> 1610.1589999999999
like why

1610.24 --> 1614.159
like it's some kind of a meme-ish thing

1612.48 --> 1616.799
to say or something but

1614.159 --> 1618.159
doesn't make any sense i don't think

1616.799 --> 1627.84
it's funny

1618.159 --> 1627.8400000000001
just pointless

1654.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
oh man

1674.1 --> 1677.23
[Music]

1680.84 --> 1683.84
hmm

1691.279 --> 1697.84
right so yeah got some people in chat at

1694.64 --> 1697.8400000000001
least it's good to see

1698.799 --> 1703.679
so yeah open to talk hope to talk about

1702.799 --> 1706.8799999999999
subjects

1703.679 --> 1706.88
i'm up for questions

1708.96 --> 1713.039
as long as they they are relevant to

1710.64 --> 1713.039
anything

1715.84 --> 1722.84
called snap finally over

1719.36 --> 1724.9599999999998
well it seems to be over in europe at

1722.84 --> 1728.1589999999999
least

1724.96 --> 1730.88
or in what is it the

1728.159 --> 1732.72
northwest europe they call it england

1730.88 --> 1736.0800000000002
and the netherlands i don't know how

1732.72 --> 1738.88
what yeah what if there's still snow

1736.08 --> 1740.399
more inland on the mainland of europe i

1738.88 --> 1741.2
don't know what it's like in germany and

1740.399 --> 1743.1999999999998
france

1741.2 --> 1745.039
could be that it's still very much snow

1743.2 --> 1747.76
covered over there but over here it's

1745.039 --> 1747.76
really mild

1747.84 --> 1756.72
all the snow is gone and i think so

1752.72 --> 1756.72
so yeah the same goes for england

1764.84 --> 1767.84
saskatchewan

1772.88 --> 1777.0390000000002
oh yep yeah by the way guns have never

1775.679 --> 1781.679
run rmp

1777.039 --> 1784.399
oh bmr you're why bmi is

1781.679 --> 1788.0800000000002
it's different again i thought yeah i'm

1784.399 --> 1788.08
just used to saying rmp but

1788.88 --> 1795.1200000000001
had you seen have you seen

1792.0 --> 1795.679
flat waters video because he had a

1795.12 --> 1799.12
couple of

1795.679 --> 1802.799
he had a video about i guess what

1799.12 --> 1802.799
his native american tribe

1803.2 --> 1807.1200000000001
or specific tribe was particularly

1805.52 --> 1812.799
interested in

1807.12 --> 1812.799
was very elaborate so had you seen that

1814.08 --> 1823.84
it's like from a week ago or maybe more

1818.0 --> 1823.84
i don't remember

1834.72 --> 1842.48
there's a squatch living in saskatoon

1839.48 --> 1842.48
saskatchewan

1848.84 --> 1851.84
okay

1869.039 --> 1872.72
oh yeah talking about witch

1875.519 --> 1882.24
like the it was really funny

1879.36 --> 1884.08
looking in between the story when i was

1882.24 --> 1886.08
watching south park because there's been

1884.08 --> 1887.039
an episode and i've gotten past that

1886.08 --> 1890.08
point

1887.039 --> 1891.279
where they address canada more like that

1890.08 --> 1894.48
episode about

1891.279 --> 1897.36
supposed royal wedding that happened

1894.48 --> 1898.96
back then and they did this absurd piece

1897.36 --> 1902.0
about it

1898.96 --> 1905.1200000000001
but they also just this

1902.0 --> 1906.159
weird little thing like what's it called

1905.12 --> 1908.559
giant bob

1906.159 --> 1909.7600000000002
oh no wait that's ugly bob but there was

1908.559 --> 1911.279
like this

1909.76 --> 1912.799
i don't know if i forgot his name a

1911.279 --> 1914.48
giant or

1912.799 --> 1916.24
he was much taller and then they

1914.48 --> 1918.24
explained it away because of supposed

1916.24 --> 1919.039
radioactivity but there was just this

1918.24 --> 1923.1200000000001
funny hint

1919.039 --> 1926.72
like as if there are still giants around

1923.12 --> 1927.6789999999999
in canada and it's kept like a national

1926.72 --> 1929.519
secret

1927.679 --> 1932.3990000000001
because they made it into like oh there

1929.519 --> 1935.679
is a secret

1932.399 --> 1938.9599999999998
a secret box that every canadian has

1935.679 --> 1941.2
and then after the president tells you

1938.96 --> 1943.279
then you open the box and then secret

1941.2 --> 1946.799
instructions against an

1943.279 --> 1948.0
ancient evil like a giant like just this

1946.799 --> 1951.9189999999999
organization to protect

1948.0 --> 1956.159
against the giants if they would i guess

1951.919 --> 1958.24
take over again it was so

1956.159 --> 1959.919
funny to look at it from a well

1958.24 --> 1961.679
cosmogeny perspective

1959.919 --> 1963.3600000000001
because they just fooled around with it

1961.679 --> 1964.88
a little

1963.36 --> 1966.32
then to realize like oh yeah they're

1964.88 --> 1969.3600000000001
joking around they're even like

1966.32 --> 1971.84
explaining it away quickly

1969.36 --> 1972.9599999999998
but just to notice that oh oh they have

1971.84 --> 1976.0
a

1972.96 --> 1977.679
a secret tradition not saying that any

1976.0 --> 1982.32
of this is literally true but

1977.679 --> 1982.3200000000002
just the suggestion of it was pretty

1988.84 --> 1994.32
amazing

1991.12 --> 1995.84
what spheres don't have them yeah

1994.32 --> 1999.039
spheres do have edges

1995.84 --> 2003.76
it's when you look past a sphere

1999.039 --> 2006.399
right it cuts off what is normally

2003.76 --> 2008.1589999999999
what is normally out there to be seen

2006.399 --> 2012.6399999999999
behind the sphere

2008.159 --> 2014.64
so there the sphere has an edge

2012.64 --> 2017.44
it's the thing that's obstructing the

2014.64 --> 2022.3200000000002
view from behind the sphere

2017.44 --> 2022.3200000000002
so spheres do have edges guess who

2023.039 --> 2025.36
right

2030.159 --> 2038.72
it might not be a like a a geometrical

2035.279 --> 2041.039
edge but they have a visual

2038.72 --> 2041.039
edge

2042.24 --> 2046.08
right so there might not be it might not

2045.6 --> 2050.399
be an

2046.08 --> 2053.679
edge as in a geometric corner

2050.399 --> 2055.679
but concerning optics there is an edge

2053.679 --> 2056.879
it's the edge that obstructs the site

2055.679 --> 2061.839
behind it

2056.879 --> 2061.839
that's the edge

2063.52 --> 2068.56
now you can call that an edge it's the

2065.76 --> 2068.5600000000004
edge of the sphere

2073.119 --> 2078.8
obstruction is not an edge well what if

2076.159 --> 2079.28
there is an edge cutting off the side

2078.8 --> 2082.3990000000003
like

2079.28 --> 2083.76
the edge of the hill you know when you

2082.399 --> 2087.04
look at the hill

2083.76 --> 2088.8790000000004
from the side of it it cuts off the side

2087.04 --> 2091.599
behind it

2088.879 --> 2092.72
and then you can point at well the edge

2091.599 --> 2096.079
of the hill the

2092.72 --> 2100.839
within the side you point at the

2096.079 --> 2103.92
edge that is cutting off sides so

2100.839 --> 2104.48
yeah it does have an edge the edge might

2103.92 --> 2107.76
not be

2104.48 --> 2111.44
geometrical right

2107.76 --> 2114.4
it's optical but it is there right

2111.44 --> 2115.599
so geometrically spheres have maybe no

2114.4 --> 2118.079
edges

2115.599 --> 2118.8
but optically they do because when you

2118.079 --> 2122.2400000000002
look

2118.8 --> 2125.52
at a sphere that sphere

2122.24 --> 2128.4799999999996
blocks things behind it

2125.52 --> 2128.88
and then when you look at the sphere

2128.48 --> 2131.839
where

2128.88 --> 2134.079
it starts blocking things behind it you

2131.839 --> 2136.48
call that the edge

2134.079 --> 2137.2000000000003
the edge of the sphere blocking things

2136.48 --> 2141.68
yes

2137.2 --> 2144.48
so you do and it's not even a metaphor

2141.68 --> 2146.16
it's just it's the emphasis on the other

2144.48 --> 2149.76
element about it

2146.16 --> 2149.7599999999998
an optics related element

2150.88 --> 2154.7200000000003
you're using the wrong terminology no i

2152.96 --> 2158.0
don't think so

2154.72 --> 2160.48
i don't think so oh no

2158.0 --> 2162.32
but an obstruction would also be a

2160.48 --> 2165.68
description of what it's doing

2162.32 --> 2166.96
right but when you point at it you could

2165.68 --> 2170.0
simply say no that's

2166.96 --> 2171.599
the edge visually it is the edge it's

2170.0 --> 2175.599
the edge

2171.599 --> 2179.52
that obstructs things behind it

2175.599 --> 2179.52
the edge of the object

2179.76 --> 2186.0
and below it everything is obstructed so

2182.96 --> 2188.64
yeah there is an edge spheres have edges

2186.0 --> 2191.359
it's not a geometric edge but it's an

2188.64 --> 2191.359
optical edge

2197.76 --> 2203.92
now if you would say okay the edge

2200.88 --> 2206.2400000000002
of the geometric sphere it would still

2203.92 --> 2209.119
be correct

2206.24 --> 2211.2
because the edge itself is not geometric

2209.119 --> 2213.52
the sphere is geometric

2211.2 --> 2214.64
and it has an edge the edge itself is

2213.52 --> 2219.04
not geometric

2214.64 --> 2223.04
perhaps right but the sphere is

2219.04 --> 2225.2
so the optical edge of a geometric

2223.04 --> 2227.839
sphere is a correct statement

2225.2 --> 2229.9199999999996
if it just leaves out the optical yeah

2227.839 --> 2231.92
it might be a little bit more easy to

2229.92 --> 2235.2000000000003
confuse

2231.92 --> 2235.2000000000003
but it is still correct

2237.52 --> 2243.44
a degree to disagree no no no you're

2240.8 --> 2245.76
just incorrect guess who

2243.44 --> 2245.76
sorry

2252.56 --> 2259.2
yeah silhouette edge all kinds of edge

2255.68 --> 2262.3999999999996
but since it is a sphere

2259.2 --> 2263.7599999999998
right that is doing it it's a sphere

2262.4 --> 2265.359
edge

2263.76 --> 2268.32
it's the edge of the sphere it's the

2265.359 --> 2271.839
optical edge of the geometric sphere

2268.32 --> 2271.839
yeah it's an edge

2281.359 --> 2287.92
ask google oh yeah google is super

2285.2 --> 2287.9199999999996
reliable

2290.8 --> 2296.32
when it comes to that no

2294.0 --> 2299.28
i know i don't need to inquire i just

2296.32 --> 2302.56
gave you an explanation

2299.28 --> 2306.2400000000002
i know i'm right so yeah i'm pretty sure

2302.56 --> 2308.96
that google will tell you that

2306.24 --> 2310.72
geometries of spheres don't have

2308.96 --> 2313.119
geometric edges right they don't have

2310.72 --> 2315.359
edges the geometry doesn't have an edge

2313.119 --> 2317.28
yeah but i explained that i literally

2315.359 --> 2319.04
just explained that just because you now

2317.28 --> 2321.2000000000003
typed it into google

2319.04 --> 2323.2
and found that same explanation and

2321.2 --> 2326.24
misunderstood it

2323.2 --> 2329.2
interpreted to make you think

2326.24 --> 2331.2
that i was incorrect that's not my

2329.2 --> 2335.7599999999998
problem

2331.2 --> 2338.8799999999997
because i am correct right the geometry

2335.76 --> 2343.599
might not have an edge but the visuals

2338.88 --> 2343.599
of the geometry will have an edge

2347.44 --> 2351.76
it's what what you think is the horizon

2349.76 --> 2354.88
remember

2351.76 --> 2358.96
it's supposedly the the edge of the

2354.88 --> 2358.96
geometric sphere you're looking past

2359.04 --> 2362.4
obstructing things right right at the

2361.68 --> 2364.72
edge

2362.4 --> 2366.8
edge of the sphere the visual edge of

2364.72 --> 2370.0
the geometric sphere

2366.8 --> 2371.76
yeah it is an edge it is an edge spheres

2370.0 --> 2374.32
have edges

2371.76 --> 2375.2000000000003
the edge might not be a geometrical

2374.32 --> 2378.4
nature

2375.2 --> 2381.68
but it is there its visual

2378.4 --> 2385.599
yeah as long as you can see the geometry

2381.68 --> 2388.56
then visually it has an edge yeah

2385.599 --> 2389.76
yeah so keep keep keep chanting for me

2388.56 --> 2392.7999999999997
keep chanting say it

2389.76 --> 2393.6800000000003
has no edge it has no edges only flat

2392.8 --> 2396.96
earth can have

2393.68 --> 2399.359
edges not my mouth can't have an edge it

2396.96 --> 2402.7200000000003
sounds so stupid yeah we know

2399.359 --> 2402.72
that's why we keep saying it

2402.8 --> 2410.5600000000004
because spheres do have edges the edge

2406.24 --> 2413.52
is just not geometrical it's optical

2410.56 --> 2413.52
it is an edge

2413.68 --> 2420.0789999999997
you mean obstruction no i mean edge

2416.72 --> 2423.52
edge h

2420.079 --> 2426.8
spheres have edges spheres

2423.52 --> 2429.44
have edges spheres have

2426.8 --> 2438.4900000000002
edges i think i know what i'm going to

2429.44 --> 2445.31
call this hangout

2438.49 --> 2445.31
[Music]

2455.68 --> 2458.8799999999997
if it's not geometric it's not an edge

2458.24 --> 2462.64
oh

2458.88 --> 2465.76
no no no i'm afraid edges

2462.64 --> 2469.92
definitely exist beyond

2465.76 --> 2474.0
the field of geometry so

2469.92 --> 2477.599
you're wrong laugh it up funny

2474.0 --> 2478.48
laugh it up yeah edges exist beyond

2477.599 --> 2482.319
geometry

2478.48 --> 2482.319
so keep laughing there guess who

2482.96 --> 2498.619
chant for me

2494.03 --> 2498.619
[Music]

2514.45 --> 2517.64
[Music]

2520.68 --> 2523.7999999999997
[Music]

2537.359 --> 2543.52
all right yeah

2540.96 --> 2545.04
now guns of neuron i did google it two

2543.52 --> 2548.24
spheres of edges and it

2545.04 --> 2551.839
basically addresses the geometry

2548.24 --> 2551.839
it's the only thing it does address

2568.4 --> 2574.88
right but it doesn't mention about

2571.76 --> 2579.8390000000004
the edge when you are looking past it

2574.88 --> 2579.839
though you know

2583.28 --> 2586.4
so keep laughing it up funny spheres do

2585.68 --> 2589.2799999999997
have edges

2586.4 --> 2590.079
it's just not a geometric edge it's an

2589.28 --> 2592.38
optical one

2590.079 --> 2594.4
when you look at it

2592.38 --> 2598.8
[Music]

2594.4 --> 2602.0
the edge of the sphere cuts off

2598.8 --> 2602.0
the visuals behind it

2602.4 --> 2606.56
so it is effective the edge is indeed

2605.28 --> 2609.92
obstructing

2606.56 --> 2614.16
things behind it but it's not

2609.92 --> 2618.16
obstruction obstruction is a description

2614.16 --> 2618.16
a description of the effect

2618.88 --> 2625.2000000000003
it it doesn't have to be

2621.96 --> 2625.839
exclusively an obstruction because it is

2625.2 --> 2627.9199999999996
not just

2625.839 --> 2629.2799999999997
an obstruction anything can be an

2627.92 --> 2632.16
obstruction

2629.28 --> 2632.96
but when it's part of a geometry it's

2632.16 --> 2635.839
not just

2632.96 --> 2635.839
obstruction

2637.68 --> 2643.7599999999998
it's the edge of the sphere

2640.72 --> 2648.0
obstructing things behind it

2643.76 --> 2663.8390000000004
right visually obstructing the edge the

2648.0 --> 2663.839
edge of the sphere

2665.28 --> 2669.92
the contour is the edge yeah that's

2667.599 --> 2669.92
right

2670.56 --> 2677.839
correct for niche

2686.079 --> 2690.88
no i think i've said it enough now i've

2688.96 --> 2704.4
i've titled to hang out it

2690.88 --> 2719.839
you know but keep laughing

2704.4 --> 2719.839
it doesn't make you edgy or anything

2720.319 --> 2733.839
oh oh thank you georgie

2723.92 --> 2733.839
mytik i appreciate that

2748.4 --> 2751.839
yeah he just doesn't want to get it he

2750.4 --> 2754.319
can't actually apply

2751.839 --> 2754.96
optics i think i think this person here

2754.319 --> 2757.599
is

2754.96 --> 2760.48
stuck in the autographic view syndrome

2757.599 --> 2764.2400000000002
stuck in his the view in his head

2760.48 --> 2767.2
so he can think about the geom geometry

2764.24 --> 2768.16
but he can't actually approach it

2767.2 --> 2771.1189999999997
through

2768.16 --> 2771.5989999999997
another way of describing things another

2771.119 --> 2775.52
type

2771.599 --> 2778.48
of wielding of language in optics

2775.52 --> 2779.28
other effects other things about it

2778.48 --> 2782.2400000000002
right

2779.28 --> 2784.0
has an edge something is obstructing

2782.24 --> 2787.5989999999997
something else

2784.0 --> 2790.8
then yeah it's hidden

2787.599 --> 2793.52
behind the edge of the obstruction

2790.8 --> 2793.52
funny isn't it

2800.96 --> 2807.76
can i show you why would i why would i

2804.319 --> 2808.96
do that when i can just tell you spheres

2807.76 --> 2812.079
have edges and then

2808.96 --> 2814.8
watch how people in chat think they're

2812.079 --> 2818.319
totally right and they keep on chanting

2814.8 --> 2818.319
like a bunch of funny zealots

2818.88 --> 2822.1600000000003
overlooking that i've already explained

2820.96 --> 2825.359
in utter detail

2822.16 --> 2828.7999999999997
exactly what that means

2825.359 --> 2830.7999999999997
so keep chanting for me keep chanting

2828.8 --> 2832.88
no the fear it notice yeah it is a

2830.8 --> 2834.96
sphere edge it is

2832.88 --> 2838.56
it's the edge of the sphere it's just

2834.96 --> 2842.48
not a geometric edge

2838.56 --> 2842.88
yeah it's optical i know it's so hard

2842.48 --> 2846.0
you know

2842.88 --> 2847.76
optics exist outside of geometry there

2846.0 --> 2850.88
is optics

2847.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
it too is there

2850.88 --> 2859.839
i know it's very very tough for you

2860.15 --> 2864.219
[Music]

2868.27 --> 2873.119
[Music]

2870.48 --> 2873.599
yeah yeah spheres don't have edges yeah

2873.119 --> 2876.1600000000003
yeah

2873.599 --> 2877.52
oh yeah they're perfectly flat yeah

2876.16 --> 2880.0
according to you

2877.52 --> 2882.88
spheres have no edges so that means that

2880.0 --> 2885.76
spheres can't obstruct things

2882.88 --> 2887.2000000000003
because there's no edge to obstruct

2885.76 --> 2890.3190000000004
behind

2887.2 --> 2894.0
you know the edge is pretty much the

2890.319 --> 2897.92
the marketer line

2894.0 --> 2900.96
between the obstruction

2897.92 --> 2903.76
and the non-obstruction

2900.96 --> 2904.2400000000002
yeah there's an edge between that it's

2903.76 --> 2907.0400000000004
to

2904.24 --> 2907.359
where things start to obstruct and where

2907.04 --> 2910.5589999999997
they

2907.359 --> 2913.839
don't that marketer line is

2910.559 --> 2918.079
you know what it's called an edge

2913.839 --> 2921.839
it's called an edge yeah

2918.079 --> 2925.2400000000002
yeah the edge is the mercator line

2921.839 --> 2928.24
between the obstruction and the

2925.24 --> 2928.24
non-obstruction

2932.0 --> 2935.839
apparent edge

2940.839 --> 2943.839
right

2944.48 --> 2946.8
wow

2947.839 --> 2952.0
but i will keep repeating it though

2952.72 --> 2956.64
i will absolutely keep repeating it

2955.04 --> 2959.119
because maybe

2956.64 --> 2961.52
if i can make you double down on your

2959.119 --> 2964.2400000000002
own stupidity enough

2961.52 --> 2967.04
eventually you'll get to the point where

2964.24 --> 2969.2799999999997
literally the entire concept of edges

2967.04 --> 2970.079
beyond geometry will literally be

2969.28 --> 2974.559
permanently

2970.079 --> 2976.7200000000003
erased from your mind due to your own

2974.559 --> 2978.4
spiritual lobotomy that you are

2976.72 --> 2981.5989999999997
currently exercising

2978.4 --> 2984.319
with your doubling down on nonsense

2981.599 --> 2984.6400000000003
because spheres do have edges it's just

2984.319 --> 2987.839
not

2984.64 --> 2987.839
geometric edges

2988.0 --> 2992.64
so keep chanting for me guess who keep

2989.92 --> 2992.64
chanting for me

2995.119 --> 3002.559
yeah no it's an

2998.24 --> 3007.9199999999996
edge within vision

3002.559 --> 3010.8390000000004
right vision is the medium

3007.92 --> 3012.16
it's the medium in which the edge can be

3010.839 --> 3017.119
found

3012.16 --> 3020.3999999999996
the edge of what the edge of the sphere

3017.119 --> 3022.6400000000003
within vision yeah

3020.4 --> 3023.92
yeah keep crying for me keep crying

3022.64 --> 3028.0
laughing

3023.92 --> 3029.839
keep it up yeah maybe if you repeat this

3028.0 --> 3033.599
over and over again

3029.839 --> 3036.0
for the next hour eventually you will be

3033.599 --> 3038.0
able to gaslight me

3036.0 --> 3039.2
into thinking that i'm wrong about what

3038.0 --> 3042.4
i'm saying

3039.2 --> 3042.3999999999996
yeah keep it up

3042.88 --> 3050.319
or you could seize being

3046.4 --> 3052.1600000000003
a cognitive dissonant idiot

3050.319 --> 3053.599
and just snap out of it and listen to

3052.16 --> 3057.1189999999997
what i'm saying

3053.599 --> 3060.559
yeah spheres have edges

3057.119 --> 3063.92
those edges of the sphere however

3060.559 --> 3067.52
are not geometric edges

3063.92 --> 3070.64
they're visual edges you see them

3067.52 --> 3073.68
it's the marketer line between

3070.64 --> 3076.7999999999997
where the sphere obstructs

3073.68 --> 3080.96
things behind it and where it

3076.8 --> 3084.6400000000003
doesn't obstruct things behind it

3080.96 --> 3089.44
yeah that's the edge that's the edge

3084.64 --> 3092.7999999999997
of the sphere within the observation

3089.44 --> 3095.839
yeah it's not a geometric edge

3092.8 --> 3097.52
it is an edge though yeah so keep

3095.839 --> 3100.0
chanting for me guess who

3097.52 --> 3101.2
keep it up yeah within vision exactly

3100.0 --> 3104.319
exactly

3101.2 --> 3107.04
oh have you caught on

3104.319 --> 3108.24
within vision yeah yeah yeah yeah i know

3107.04 --> 3112.319
i know

3108.24 --> 3112.8799999999997
yeah within vision is where the sphere

3112.319 --> 3115.599
has an

3112.88 --> 3117.44
edge that's right yeah yell it out yell

3115.599 --> 3120.1600000000003
it out

3117.44 --> 3122.0
chant for me yell it out break through

3120.16 --> 3122.5589999999997
the cognitive dissonance yes that's

3122.0 --> 3125.28
right

3122.559 --> 3127.76
within vision within vision spheres have

3125.28 --> 3130.7200000000003
an edge

3127.76 --> 3130.7200000000003
scream it for me

3130.8 --> 3134.7200000000003
scream it for me fundy come on

3135.359 --> 3138.48
have you caught on yet spheres have

3137.76 --> 3142.079
edges

3138.48 --> 3142.72
yeah within vision have you figured it

3142.079 --> 3145.599
out

3142.72 --> 3146.3999999999996
you see now you see now that arwin was

3145.599 --> 3153.839
right

3146.4 --> 3153.839
and you were wrong do you see it

3154.16 --> 3157.2
you're a little slow

3157.44 --> 3161.119
but i i think he's he's caught on

3159.68 --> 3165.04
because he's kind of like

3161.119 --> 3168.079
flipped it around in himself

3165.04 --> 3168.64
yeah the edges oh wait you mean that

3168.079 --> 3172.48
edge

3168.64 --> 3173.2
that you claimed for over 15 minutes in

3172.48 --> 3175.76
my chat

3173.2 --> 3176.24
spheres do not have because you googled

3175.76 --> 3179.5200000000004
it

3176.24 --> 3182.72
you mean that visual edge

3179.52 --> 3185.28
that you claimed spheres do not have

3182.72 --> 3185.2799999999997
that one

3185.76 --> 3189.8390000000004
yeah i know i know it's visual isn't

3188.64 --> 3191.68
that funny

3189.839 --> 3194.0789999999997
keep laughing and crying at the same

3191.68 --> 3197.68
time for me

3194.079 --> 3200.4
come on throw it all out share your pain

3197.68 --> 3202.0789999999997
i know you were wrong spheres do have

3200.4 --> 3205.119
edges

3202.079 --> 3207.3590000000004
yeah it's just not a geometric edge it's

3205.119 --> 3209.52
it edge within the visual

3207.359 --> 3212.88
when you look at this fear it does have

3209.52 --> 3216.16
an edge yeah that's right

3212.88 --> 3219.599
say it a couple of more times

3216.16 --> 3223.839
yeah tell me how the edge is visual

3219.599 --> 3223.839
i know i've been telling you

3232.96 --> 3237.359
no i'm not gonna ban him i'm just gonna

3235.44 --> 3240.559
make him

3237.359 --> 3240.5589999999997
boil in his own fat

3240.64 --> 3244.48
because he thought he was trolling me

3243.2 --> 3248.64
but it turns out

3244.48 --> 3251.92
he was actually just trolling himself

3248.64 --> 3255.5989999999997
because he didn't think to think

3251.92 --> 3258.88
beyond his his little

3255.599 --> 3260.48
straw man gaslighting attempted to try

3258.88 --> 3263.76
and make me

3260.48 --> 3266.2400000000002
stop saying edge

3263.76 --> 3268.3190000000004
in relation to his fear he just he just

3266.24 --> 3270.64
wanted that to stop it's shameful

3268.319 --> 3272.5589999999997
you know ballers don't like to be

3270.64 --> 3275.359
reminded

3272.559 --> 3277.0400000000004
that the sphere they think they stand on

3275.359 --> 3280.0
has an edge

3277.04 --> 3281.44
that edge isn't geometric but it is an

3280.0 --> 3284.079
edge though

3281.44 --> 3284.96
where does it edge come into play or

3284.079 --> 3288.6400000000003
when you

3284.96 --> 3293.839
look at it then suddenly that sphere

3288.64 --> 3293.839
has an edge yeah

3295.119 --> 3299.92
not the edge of a sphere edge of your

3298.799 --> 3303.359
vision

3299.92 --> 3305.76
now now it's actually within the vision

3303.359 --> 3308.5589999999997
the edge of vision is something else

3305.76 --> 3310.6400000000003
the edge of vision is the absolute limit

3308.559 --> 3312.559
of sight based on

3310.64 --> 3314.319
the conditions of the medium you're

3312.559 --> 3315.2000000000003
looking through that's the actual edge

3314.319 --> 3318.96
of division

3315.2 --> 3323.52
now the edge is of the sphere

3318.96 --> 3327.28
within vision

3323.52 --> 3330.319
that's the edge the edge of this sphere

3327.28 --> 3331.28
within vision it's not the edge of the

3330.319 --> 3333.7599999999998
vision

3331.28 --> 3336.559
she's very you have a lot of trouble

3333.76 --> 3339.92
putting these two together do you

3336.559 --> 3343.28
edge sphere

3339.92 --> 3346.319
edge sphere

3343.28 --> 3349.92
they go together

3346.319 --> 3354.48
yeah edge sphere sphere

3349.92 --> 3358.319
edge edges of spheres

3354.48 --> 3361.119
they have an edge it's the one

3358.319 --> 3363.119
right it's it's the one thing about it

3361.119 --> 3365.28
that obstructs

3363.119 --> 3366.1600000000003
things beyond it when you look at it

3365.28 --> 3369.76
within vision

3366.16 --> 3369.7599999999998
that's an edge that's an edge of a

3374.839 --> 3380.0789999999997
sphere

3376.96 --> 3382.48
oh an apparent edge yeah

3380.079 --> 3383.6800000000003
yeah i know it's an apparent edge that's

3382.48 --> 3386.72
right because it's

3383.68 --> 3388.3999999999996
an edge within sight yeah

3386.72 --> 3391.839
larry the march look even larry the

3388.4 --> 3391.839
march get it gets it by now

3392.16 --> 3396.24
right so you're in trouble guess who

3395.119 --> 3399.76
you're in trouble because

3396.24 --> 3404.5589999999997
even regular ballers in chat are now

3399.76 --> 3406.96
agreeing with me

3404.559 --> 3407.76
yeah it is within vision that's right

3406.96 --> 3410.319
the sphere

3407.76 --> 3412.88
has an edge within vision because you're

3410.319 --> 3414.799
gonna look at the sphere right

3412.88 --> 3416.2400000000002
you're gonna look out over the sphere

3414.799 --> 3418.88
that you think you're standing on

3416.24 --> 3419.839
right so you're you think you stand on

3418.88 --> 3422.7200000000003
the sphere

3419.839 --> 3423.2
you look out over it guess what that's

3422.72 --> 3426.0789999999997
fear

3423.2 --> 3426.3999999999996
within sight right you're looking over

3426.079 --> 3429.599
it

3426.4 --> 3433.52
right has an edge

3429.599 --> 3437.599
yeah and that edge you thought

3433.52 --> 3440.88
was like the geometric horizon

3437.599 --> 3440.88
that's what you originally thought

3442.88 --> 3450.0
right the geometric horizon is

3446.96 --> 3450.799
like if you're going to try to point it

3450.0 --> 3454.24
out

3450.799 --> 3455.28
within vision well it's going to be the

3454.24 --> 3456.64
sphere edge

3455.28 --> 3458.8390000000004
right because we're dealing with

3456.64 --> 3462.319
division right we're not trying to

3458.839 --> 3464.96
calculate what things are supposed to be

3462.319 --> 3466.16
geometrically now we're going through

3464.96 --> 3469.76
optics through

3466.16 --> 3472.8799999999997
vision and in vision spheres

3469.76 --> 3475.92
have edges i know

3472.88 --> 3480.4
so so keep on posting that laughy

3475.92 --> 3483.52
cry crying smiley just keep doing it

3480.4 --> 3488.96
throw it all out because

3483.52 --> 3491.7599999999998
you're wrong yes spheres do have edges

3488.96 --> 3494.319
it's not a geometric sphere edge yeah

3491.76 --> 3494.3190000000004
that's right

3497.92 --> 3502.48
but they do have visual edges though you

3500.319 --> 3506.4
know when you have a ball

3502.48 --> 3511.68
and you're looking at it the geometric

3506.4 --> 3514.4
edge or well the visual edge basically

3511.68 --> 3516.48
it's a bit confusing like that because

3514.4 --> 3516.88
we like to call it the geometric sphere

3516.48 --> 3519.52
edge

3516.88 --> 3520.48
because the geometric sphere within

3519.52 --> 3523.68
vision

3520.48 --> 3527.359
does have an edge the edge

3523.68 --> 3531.7599999999998
itself is not geometric

3527.359 --> 3534.24
right but the visuals of the geometry

3531.76 --> 3535.76
sphere the geometric sphere the sphere

3534.24 --> 3539.839
itself is geometric

3535.76 --> 3542.48
and in it has an edge though

3539.839 --> 3542.48
in vision

3546.799 --> 3555.52
yeah that's right did i claim

3551.359 --> 3559.119
that the edge of the sphere

3555.52 --> 3562.799
was geometric did i say that

3559.119 --> 3564.319
at any point guess who did i say that

3562.799 --> 3564.96
i'm pretty sure i didn't i'm pretty sure

3564.319 --> 3569.2
that

3564.96 --> 3572.64
say say i'm pretty sure that i said

3569.2 --> 3576.319
spheres have edges

3572.64 --> 3578.16
the edge of spheres are not geometric

3576.319 --> 3583.2799999999997
though

3578.16 --> 3586.3999999999996
it's visual within the visuals

3583.28 --> 3589.8390000000004
looking at a sphere it has an edge

3586.4 --> 3592.2400000000002
it's the point on the sphere

3589.839 --> 3594.64
where it starts obstructing things

3592.24 --> 3598.72
behind it so you can't see them that

3594.64 --> 3598.72
edge of the sphere

3604.64 --> 3612.24
so yeah do indeed rest your case because

3608.079 --> 3615.04
no i'm not contradicting myself at all

3612.24 --> 3616.8799999999997
i am getting a bit bored though saying

3615.04 --> 3619.2
the same thing over and over again

3616.88 --> 3621.44
which is correct i described it

3619.2 --> 3625.7599999999998
correctly every step of the way

3621.44 --> 3629.76
and hey if somebody actually respectable

3625.76 --> 3632.2400000000002
would contradict me in the chat

3629.76 --> 3635.2000000000003
then i might reconsider but i'm pretty

3632.24 --> 3639.9199999999996
sure i got it exactly right

3635.2 --> 3643.2799999999997
right because spheres geometrically

3639.92 --> 3646.48
don't have edges but visually

3643.28 --> 3649.8390000000004
they do have edges so

3646.48 --> 3654.0
to claim that spheres have no

3649.839 --> 3657.839
edges is incorrect

3654.0 --> 3657.839
they do have edges

3661.28 --> 3665.2000000000003
that edge is just not geometric

3666.24 --> 3671.839
am i am i getting through to you yet

3668.16 --> 3671.839
guess who

3681.76 --> 3688.1600000000003
if it's in your vision then it's not a

3684.559 --> 3688.1600000000003
geometric sphere edge

3696.319 --> 3704.079
well i did i say that

3700.559 --> 3706.3190000000004
did i i don't think so no wait

3704.079 --> 3708.079
that part you supposedly said no if it

3706.319 --> 3710.799
is in your vision

3708.079 --> 3711.3590000000004
then it is a geometric sphere edge right

3710.799 --> 3715.52
this

3711.359 --> 3718.799
is geometrical and the geometric sphere

3715.52 --> 3720.319
has an edge the edge of the geometric

3718.799 --> 3723.44
sphere however

3720.319 --> 3728.5589999999997
is not a geometric edge

3723.44 --> 3728.559
it's a visual edge yeah

3733.76 --> 3741.599
no it's not no it's not

3736.88 --> 3746.319
yeah it is

3741.599 --> 3750.4
yeah geometric spheres do have edges

3746.319 --> 3750.4
they just don't have geometric edges

3752.16 --> 3757.52
but the sphere is geometric and it does

3755.68 --> 3760.0
have an edge

3757.52 --> 3762.24
it's an optical illusion that's right dr

3760.0 --> 3764.4
gonzo

3762.24 --> 3769.839
ah whatever you want to call it no it's

3764.4 --> 3769.839
not yeah it is

3775.119 --> 3779.44
yeah george sanford yeah i look at this

3777.68 --> 3780.64
point i don't even want to bring in the

3779.44 --> 3783.44
black swan anymore

3780.64 --> 3784.48
because these people are so [ __ ] up in

3783.44 --> 3788.16
their mind

3784.48 --> 3789.2
so [ __ ] up like i'm starting to get

3788.16 --> 3794.3999999999996
worried

3789.2 --> 3794.3999999999996
like if you're that stupid then

3794.559 --> 3799.92
i don't know what's keeping you alive

3796.24 --> 3803.2799999999997
anymore really out there

3799.92 --> 3806.48
if you if you can't even get basic facts

3803.28 --> 3807.76
straight even when i explain them over

3806.48 --> 3810.72
and over and over again

3807.76 --> 3811.44
this is not like globiola's confusion

3810.72 --> 3814.48
okay

3811.44 --> 3817.52
it's not it's not that complicated

3814.48 --> 3820.88
it's a very rudimentary

3817.52 --> 3823.0389999999998
basic little thing that i just explained

3820.88 --> 3826.799
to you for the last half hour

3823.039 --> 3832.2400000000002
and more and you just don't get it

3826.799 --> 3832.24
it makes you really really stupid

3833.28 --> 3837.2000000000003
you understand cognitive dissonance

3836.64 --> 3840.0
indeed

3837.2 --> 3841.359
you're very cognitive doesn't it because

3840.0 --> 3844.48
you can't seem to

3841.359 --> 3847.44
get over the fact that i never

3844.48 --> 3848.559
claimed the edge was a geometric edge

3847.44 --> 3851.599
ever

3848.559 --> 3855.3590000000004
sphere may be geometric but

3851.599 --> 3858.48
its edge is not geometric

3855.359 --> 3860.88
is visual and then you keep saying to me

3858.48 --> 3863.839
oh look this is what you're saying yeah

3860.88 --> 3866.319
i know i know that is what i was saying

3863.839 --> 3867.7599999999998
it wasn't the other thing that you

3866.319 --> 3869.92
thought i was saying

3867.76 --> 3872.6400000000003
that's why i described it over and over

3869.92 --> 3872.64
and over again

3876.88 --> 3880.079
yeah i know that's what i said i

3878.799 --> 3883.44
remember i remember

3880.079 --> 3884.2400000000002
it's all on record you're having a very

3883.44 --> 3886.799
serious

3884.24 --> 3889.68
like cognitive breakdown it's not even

3886.799 --> 3892.799
cognitive dissonance anymore

3889.68 --> 3894.5589999999997
are you having trouble are you switching

3892.799 --> 3898.16
medications or anything

3894.559 --> 3900.1600000000003
because this is pretty serious like

3898.16 --> 3904.24
mental breakdown you're you're

3900.16 --> 3904.24
displaying here in my chat right now

3907.28 --> 3914.48
only in your vision not oh oh really

3911.28 --> 3916.799
so if it's only in my vision then it

3914.48 --> 3918.799
doesn't have an edge

3916.799 --> 3922.88
but what about when i look at it i'm

3918.799 --> 3926.24
pretty sure it has an edge

3922.88 --> 3929.76
right because yeah the edge

3926.24 --> 3933.2
demarcates where basically the sphere

3929.76 --> 3933.2000000000003
obstructs things behind it

3934.839 --> 3937.839
so

3955.2 --> 3958.24
in my vision spheres enough edges yeah

3957.52 --> 3961.2
well we can

3958.24 --> 3963.52
see spheres though the real ones the

3961.2 --> 3966.8799999999997
ones that are actually there

3963.52 --> 3968.64
right how would you even know

3966.88 --> 3970.88
something was a sphere if you couldn't

3968.64 --> 3972.0789999999997
see it how would you know for sure it's

3970.88 --> 3975.039
a sphere

3972.079 --> 3975.039
if you can't look at it

3975.2 --> 3981.2799999999997
i think i've just dug into like really

3978.72 --> 3982.799
really deep painful routes here with

3981.28 --> 3984.2400000000002
this guy

3982.799 --> 3986.24
so he's probably going to keep on

3984.24 --> 3987.4399999999996
chanting this nonsense for the rest of

3986.24 --> 3990.8799999999997
the day now

3987.44 --> 3994.7200000000003
basically double speaking constantly

3990.88 --> 3997.92
how spheres do have edges visually

3994.72 --> 3999.52
but not in the geometry geometrically

3997.92 --> 3999.92
speaking they don't have an edge and

3999.52 --> 4002.799
that

3999.92 --> 4004.96
apparently according to him means with

4002.799 --> 4006.4
caps and a lot of laughing and crying

4004.96 --> 4008.48
smileys

4006.4 --> 4009.6800000000003
that they don't have an edge even though

4008.48 --> 4012.4
you now in

4009.68 --> 4014.5589999999997
your sentences say that they do have

4012.4 --> 4021.839
edges

4014.559 --> 4021.8390000000004
it's very sad yeah

4033.359 --> 4038.0
so maybe maybe chant it one more time

4038.4 --> 4041.44
for old times sake

4041.599 --> 4048.559
chant it for me tell me how

4045.039 --> 4051.28
spheres have edges

4048.559 --> 4051.6800000000003
but they also don't have edges tell me

4051.28 --> 4063.8390000000004
again

4051.68 --> 4063.839
guess who tell me come come on

4076.96 --> 4083.039
how is edge being defined here i already

4080.559 --> 4083.039
said that

4088.839 --> 4095.44
optical

4091.359 --> 4097.359
not actual edge doesn't actually have an

4095.44 --> 4097.679
edge because spheres themselves don't

4097.359 --> 4101.04
have

4097.679 --> 4101.679
edges except the one in your vision

4101.04 --> 4104.48
though

4101.679 --> 4105.12
the one that you mentioned the not

4104.48 --> 4109.04
actual

4105.12 --> 4109.04
edge that is still an edge

4109.12 --> 4115.12
right it's just not a geometric edge so

4111.52 --> 4115.120000000001
yeah yeah you keep chanting for me

4115.92 --> 4122.4
maybe keep it up for another 50 minutes

4119.04 --> 4124.4
keep it up show the world how much in

4122.4 --> 4126.5599999999995
pain you really are

4124.4 --> 4133.839
maybe use some more caps and then some

4126.56 --> 4133.839000000001
more smileys

4133.92 --> 4140.88
then it's apparent not actual edge

4137.359 --> 4142.64
an actual edge but it's an edge isn't it

4140.88 --> 4144.64
are you saying that apparent edges are

4142.64 --> 4147.839
not edges i'm pretty sure that

4144.64 --> 4147.839
an edge is an edge

4149.44 --> 4155.759
whether the edge appears within

4152.719 --> 4159.6
sight or if it's a

4155.759 --> 4164.799
geometric edge it's like a fact a factor

4159.6 --> 4167.120000000001
of a geometry right both are edges

4164.799 --> 4168.96
both are edges it's just one type of

4167.12 --> 4172.159
edges a different type of

4168.96 --> 4175.6
edge as the other right

4172.159 --> 4176.96
but yeah by your own admission and then

4175.6 --> 4179.6
contradiction

4176.96 --> 4180.96
spheres do have edges they have edges in

4179.6 --> 4182.799
their vision that's right

4180.96 --> 4184.4
well you're looking out over one right

4182.799 --> 4186.08
now right that's what you're presuming

4184.4 --> 4188.5599999999995
that you're standing on a sphere

4186.08 --> 4191.04
that you are looking out over well guess

4188.56 --> 4193.4400000000005
what in your sight

4191.04 --> 4194.4
spheres have edges you've already

4193.44 --> 4196.96
admitted that

4194.4 --> 4198.879999999999
and then proceeded to deny that spheres

4196.96 --> 4202.56
have edges in the same sentence

4198.88 --> 4206.32
over and over and over again

4202.56 --> 4209.679
not an actuator stop double shooting

4206.32 --> 4212.159
sorry i'm gonna discontinue i i can

4209.679 --> 4213.6
only response in laughter after this

4212.159 --> 4217.839999999999
point now

4213.6 --> 4217.84
this is just getting really ridiculous

4220.63 --> 4223.77
[Music]

4227.04 --> 4234.159
oh gods here comes another one

4231.36 --> 4235.04
red pill drill yeah i know i know google

4234.159 --> 4237.36
says

4235.04 --> 4239.92
yeah that in the geometry spheres don't

4237.36 --> 4242.4
have edges i know

4239.92 --> 4243.76
there they forgot to mention though that

4242.4 --> 4245.92
visually

4243.76 --> 4249.360000000001
there's another aspect to spheres and

4245.92 --> 4252.96
there in visuals they do have edges

4249.36 --> 4254.0
right it's just that as a geometrical

4252.96 --> 4256.64
aspect

4254.0 --> 4257.28
spheres don't have edges i know i know

4256.64 --> 4260.64
that

4257.28 --> 4261.84
right but visually they do oh it forgot

4260.64 --> 4264.08
to mention that

4261.84 --> 4265.28
well i'm sorry that google forgot to

4264.08 --> 4267.6
mention that

4265.28 --> 4268.4
i'm mentioning it though because it's

4267.6 --> 4270.84
true

4268.4 --> 4272.32
and demonstrable you can prove it for

4270.84 --> 4274.4800000000005
yourself

4272.32 --> 4276.159
you can demonstrate i've explained this

4274.48 --> 4278.32
many times and you

4276.159 --> 4280.239
in my chat confirmed this and then

4278.32 --> 4280.48
proceeded to double speak but it's not

4280.239 --> 4283.04
an

4280.48 --> 4284.5599999999995
edge though it's only an apparent edge

4283.04 --> 4286.08
it's only an edge when you look at it

4284.56 --> 4288.0
right it's not really an edge

4286.08 --> 4290.159
yeah yeah close your eyes put a

4288.0 --> 4291.36
blindfold on it doesn't exist anymore it

4290.159 --> 4292.239
doesn't have an edge because i'm not

4291.36 --> 4294.239
looking at it

4292.239 --> 4296.48
yeah keep on keep on chanting chant for

4294.239 --> 4300.159
me chant for me guess who

4296.48 --> 4302.48
keep it up not actual then

4300.159 --> 4305.599999999999
well it does have an edge it's just not

4302.48 --> 4308.639999999999
a geometric edge

4305.6 --> 4311.52
yeah it's not the terminology of

4308.64 --> 4312.88
edge within geometry it's a different

4311.52 --> 4316.4800000000005
type of edge

4312.88 --> 4319.52
it's a visual edge it's the edge within

4316.48 --> 4328.08
sight demarking an

4319.52 --> 4332.0
object and what it obstructs behind

4328.08 --> 4335.92
is a waste of time a little here we go

4332.0 --> 4335.92
again it is getting a bit tiresome

4338.08 --> 4342.08
i know i know red pill trill i've been

4341.28 --> 4345.5199999999995
trying to say

4342.08 --> 4348.719
that to this guy the guess who person

4345.52 --> 4349.52
i know geometrically spheres don't have

4348.719 --> 4351.84
edges

4349.52 --> 4353.120000000001
i never claimed that so i don't know why

4351.84 --> 4356.96
you're putting that

4353.12 --> 4360.64
in my shoes right i didn't say that

4356.96 --> 4364.4
i didn't claim a geometric edge

4360.64 --> 4368.2390000000005
like within the geometry in edge right

4364.4 --> 4371.199
just claiming that geometric spheres

4368.239 --> 4372.879999999999
the spheres themselves with the geometry

4371.199 --> 4376.239
of sphericity

4372.88 --> 4379.52
they do have edges the edges they have

4376.239 --> 4380.08
are not geometric edges they're visual

4379.52 --> 4383.120000000001
edges

4380.08 --> 4387.12
they're edges when you look at them

4383.12 --> 4391.28
and those edges demark where

4387.12 --> 4394.08
the sphere obstructs things behind it

4391.28 --> 4395.5199999999995
versus where they don't that's the edge

4394.08 --> 4398.8
of the sphere

4395.52 --> 4400.0
right it's not a geometric aspect of the

4398.8 --> 4402.159000000001
sphere

4400.0 --> 4403.84
it's what happens when you look at it

4402.159 --> 4407.759999999999
i've been trying to tell

4403.84 --> 4409.6
this really giggling weirdo in chat

4407.76 --> 4411.76
called guess who

4409.6 --> 4413.4400000000005
and he's already confirmed that and then

4411.76 --> 4415.6
proceeded to double speak his

4413.44 --> 4416.799999999999
way into saying but they don't have

4415.6 --> 4419.1990000000005
edges even though you

4416.8 --> 4420.159000000001
literally just said they have edges in

4419.199 --> 4422.32
the same sentence

4420.159 --> 4424.5599999999995
and you keep on doing that keep chanting

4422.32 --> 4427.84
keep chanting for me

4424.56 --> 4427.84
keep chanting for me

4428.88 --> 4433.1990000000005
this is like spheriolus or something

4431.04 --> 4433.199
this

4433.679 --> 4438.0
it's a constant double speak this is

4435.92 --> 4441.84
just insane

4438.0 --> 4441.84
constant constant almost speak

4447.199 --> 4452.5599999999995
oh oh now oh look at that he never said

4451.36 --> 4456.96
the sphere has an

4452.56 --> 4459.679
edge you never said that only appears so

4456.96 --> 4462.4800000000005
it doesn't actually have an edge there

4459.679 --> 4465.84
it doesn't have a demarcation line

4462.48 --> 4469.599999999999
between where the object known as sphere

4465.84 --> 4472.32
blocks things into the distance it just

4469.6 --> 4474.2390000000005
just looks like it it doesn't actually

4472.32 --> 4477.04
obstruct anything

4474.239 --> 4478.718999999999
it just looks like it it actually goes

4477.04 --> 4481.28
on forever you know why

4478.719 --> 4483.36
you know why the earth that you presume

4481.28 --> 4486.639999999999
to be a sphere

4483.36 --> 4489.04
only appears

4486.64 --> 4490.08
to have an edge right it's because it's

4489.04 --> 4492.96
not a sphere

4490.08 --> 4495.199
you're actually standing on a flat plane

4492.96 --> 4498.4
and the only thing

4495.199 --> 4498.96
that limits your site is the quality of

4498.4 --> 4501.28
the air

4498.96 --> 4503.04
and your resolution limit based on the

4501.28 --> 4506.239
observation height

4503.04 --> 4508.0
yeah black swan observations disprove

4506.239 --> 4512.159
the geometry

4508.0 --> 4513.28
because the edge the visual edge of what

4512.159 --> 4515.599999999999
you're looking at

4513.28 --> 4517.12
we also know it as the horizon here on

4515.6 --> 4520.64
earth

4517.12 --> 4524.239
it doesn't abide by

4520.64 --> 4526.0
spherical geometry the earth were is

4524.239 --> 4529.678999999999
sphere

4526.0 --> 4532.96
then that visual edge

4529.679 --> 4537.1990000000005
of the obstruction caused by the sphere

4532.96 --> 4539.36
getting in the way right visually

4537.199 --> 4540.5599999999995
would have to be at a certain consistent

4539.36 --> 4544.4
rate

4540.56 --> 4548.320000000001
and guess what black swan observations

4544.4 --> 4553.839999999999
disprove that persistent geometrical

4548.32 --> 4553.84
rate because the earth is not a sphere

4557.12 --> 4560.239
not an edge yeah keep chanting for me

4559.36 --> 4562.96
not an edge

4560.239 --> 4564.799999999999
keep chanting chanting chan chan chan

4562.96 --> 4567.12
chants or more spheres don't have edges

4564.8 --> 4568.400000000001
except they do it's just visual so they

4567.12 --> 4572.08
don't have an edge

4568.4 --> 4574.96
right spheres only have

4572.08 --> 4575.679
visual edges so they don't have any

4574.96 --> 4579.04
edges

4575.679 --> 4595.84
yeah yeah keep keep chanting for me

4579.04 --> 4595.84
keep chanting keep it up

4598.96 --> 4602.719
yeah that's right annie franson that's

4601.199 --> 4604.879999999999
correct yeah that totally

4602.719 --> 4607.04
weird silly distorted picture and all

4604.88 --> 4607.36
that yeah you shouldn't be able to see

4607.04 --> 4610.32
that

4607.36 --> 4611.679
ever those rigs should have been

4610.32 --> 4613.92
absolutely obstructed

4611.679 --> 4616.8
at all times and no conditions could

4613.92 --> 4620.8
ever make them visible

4616.8 --> 4624.64
from beyond the edge

4620.8 --> 4627.76
of the sphere visual wise

4624.64 --> 4628.400000000001
yeah that shouldn't be possible because

4627.76 --> 4631.679
you can't

4628.4 --> 4635.28
look behind a hill

4631.679 --> 4640.08
sight doesn't make things visible

4635.28 --> 4642.32
beyond a sphere edge

4640.08 --> 4642.32
huh

4645.679 --> 4653.1990000000005
how many visual edges are spheres

4650.64 --> 4653.1990000000005
just one

4653.84 --> 4662.719
it's the entire thing it's that circle

4658.159 --> 4666.239
yeah the sphere edge is a circle

4662.719 --> 4668.56
right because you see it it blocks out

4666.239 --> 4672.159
things behind it

4668.56 --> 4675.280000000001
and yeah the pattern of it

4672.159 --> 4680.239
of what is concealed is concealed beyond

4675.28 --> 4682.8
this circle the circle of the sphere

4680.239 --> 4682.799999999999
the edge

4685.679 --> 4688.96
atmospheric refraction no no that's

4688.4 --> 4692.08
that's

4688.96 --> 4696.64
fiction because visuals you there is no

4692.08 --> 4700.4
optics medium that can make you

4696.64 --> 4704.719
without any mirrors might you might add

4700.4 --> 4706.0
actual mirrors just the regular state of

4704.719 --> 4710.159
atmosphere cannot

4706.0 --> 4714.88
make you see things obstructed

4710.159 --> 4718.0
behind geometric obstructions

4714.88 --> 4721.1990000000005
behind actual obstructions

4718.0 --> 4724.8
not just apparent ones

4721.199 --> 4727.919999999999
like for example the edge of a sphere

4724.8 --> 4731.76
the non-geometric edge

4727.92 --> 4731.76
of a geometric sphere

4732.84 --> 4749.84
huh all right

4735.76 --> 4749.84
i'll be back in two minutes

4844.84 --> 4847.84
so

4849.92 --> 4853.28
so she's still chanting

4858.8 --> 4866.639
oh that's a oh look at that

4863.04 --> 4869.5199999999995
i just had to stop telling him for two

4866.639 --> 4870.88
minutes after a 45 minute non-stop

4869.52 --> 4875.360000000001
reminder

4870.88 --> 4878.639
and now he agrees

4875.36 --> 4882.32
took a very long time

4878.639 --> 4887.36
took you a very very long time though

4882.32 --> 4891.44
right so yeah that's right

4887.36 --> 4895.36
non-geometric edge of a geometric sphere

4891.44 --> 4899.678999999999
yeah so you agree then

4895.36 --> 4903.839999999999
spheres have edges

4899.679 --> 4903.84
thank you very much

4904.75 --> 4909.85
[Music]

4913.89 --> 4917.4890000000005
[Music]

4920.31 --> 4923.379000000001
[Music]

4930.21 --> 4934.639
[Music]

4932.08 --> 4937.5199999999995
oh look at that that's what i've been

4934.639 --> 4940.32
trying to say the whole time

4937.52 --> 4940.96
not an actual what a parent no this

4940.32 --> 4944.239
sphere

4940.96 --> 4949.36
doesn't have a geometric edge oh

4944.239 --> 4949.36
sorry did did i say geometric edge

4949.84 --> 4954.159000000001
did i say that at any point did i write

4952.4 --> 4957.599999999999
that down

4954.159 --> 4960.32
where did i say geometric edge really

4957.6 --> 4961.76
except maybe in several times repeating

4960.32 --> 4964.08
myself i might have

4961.76 --> 4965.12
accidentally slipped up what i was

4964.08 --> 4967.6
saying

4965.12 --> 4970.08
but i think that overall i've been

4967.6 --> 4971.360000000001
pretty concise and accurate

4970.08 --> 4973.36
and i never claimed there was a

4971.36 --> 4976.639
geometric edge i just said

4973.36 --> 4977.04
spheres have edges and that's triggering

4976.639 --> 4980.2390000000005
you

4977.04 --> 4982.08
to no end even now i'm saying it

4980.239 --> 4983.44
even now when i'm saying it you still

4982.08 --> 4985.5199999999995
can't handle it

4983.44 --> 4986.48
even though you've already conceded that

4985.52 --> 4990.88
yes

4986.48 --> 4993.759999999999
spheres do have edges

4990.88 --> 4995.84
it's just not geometric edge they do

4993.76 --> 4998.639
have an edge though

4995.84 --> 4999.28
yeah and then now you can write angry

4998.639 --> 5002.2390000000005
emails

4999.28 --> 5003.679
to google about how they didn't inform

5002.239 --> 5006.959999999999
you about that part

5003.679 --> 5010.4
they left that out it just

5006.96 --> 5014.08
didn't approach the sphere

5010.4 --> 5017.28
beyond geometry concerning the word

5014.08 --> 5020.239
edge when you google it

5017.28 --> 5020.239
yeah i noticed that

5020.48 --> 5025.599999999999
spheres do have edges though

5023.6 --> 5026.719
isn't that just funny isn't that just

5025.6 --> 5028.96
funny how they do

5026.719 --> 5031.199
actually have edges you already admitted

5028.96 --> 5031.199
that

5032.78 --> 5035.978999999999
[Music]

5038.0 --> 5042.56
sphere edges plural yeah that's right no

5040.639 --> 5045.6
but i said spheres

5042.56 --> 5048.88
not a sphere a sphere has an

5045.6 --> 5052.08
edge i said spheres have

5048.88 --> 5055.12
edges yeah

5052.08 --> 5057.84
so multiple spheres will have multiple

5055.12 --> 5057.84
edges

5058.4 --> 5061.44
because there's more of them

5068.96 --> 5072.2390000000005
yes yeah that's called a concession

5070.8 --> 5075.28
guess who but

5072.239 --> 5078.08
hey maybe if you

5075.28 --> 5080.32
if you write a declaration how saying

5078.08 --> 5083.679
that spheres indeed do have edges

5080.32 --> 5086.799999999999
doesn't mean that spheres have edges

5083.679 --> 5090.08
then by all means do that

5086.8 --> 5093.4400000000005
you know maybe you can prove to yourself

5090.08 --> 5093.44
that you didn't concede

5093.76 --> 5099.84
that's okay

5105.52 --> 5110.159000000001
why is that not correct english multiple

5108.08 --> 5114.08
spheres have multiple edges

5110.159 --> 5117.36
a sphere has an edge right

5114.08 --> 5127.44
spheres multiple have

5117.36 --> 5130.88
edges how is that incorrect english

5127.44 --> 5130.879999999999
spheres have an edge

5132.0 --> 5138.4
okay is that

5135.28 --> 5140.4
i don't know but that's also a way of

5138.4 --> 5144.0
saying that

5140.4 --> 5146.0
because each multiple separated spheres

5144.0 --> 5149.52
have an edge indeed

5146.0 --> 5152.639
but if you have multiple spheres

5149.52 --> 5154.96
then they have all edges at the same

5152.639 --> 5156.8
time so this is uh really nitpicking

5154.96 --> 5159.679
here

5156.8 --> 5159.679
i'm not incorrect

5159.92 --> 5165.36
if i'd be incorrect i'd feel it i feel

5162.719 --> 5165.36
it's off

5165.76 --> 5169.84
so i don't see it

5178.48 --> 5182.718999999999
it's the correct way of saying it well

5180.239 --> 5185.919999999999
yeah well my way works as well

5182.719 --> 5185.92
spheres have edges

5186.0 --> 5191.12
because there are multiple spheres they

5188.32 --> 5194.239
have multiple edges

5191.12 --> 5197.84
now separatedly multiple spheres

5194.239 --> 5201.199
separatedly separate separately

5197.84 --> 5205.6
have an edge each separate sphere has an

5201.199 --> 5207.12
edge so spheres also have an edge

5205.6 --> 5210.96
but yeah if you're just going to take

5207.12 --> 5212.239
them all at once then spheres have edges

5210.96 --> 5216.88
a whole bunch of spheres and they all

5212.239 --> 5216.879999999999
have edges yeah it's both correct

5218.8 --> 5223.4400000000005
yeah but they do have edges they have

5221.6 --> 5227.6
just not geometrical

5223.44 --> 5231.678999999999
edges guess who was

5227.6 --> 5231.679
this is getting really ocd

5234.639 --> 5240.96
i think you need to just maybe work that

5237.679 --> 5240.96
out on your own guess who

5245.6 --> 5250.08
they'd appeared to have edges but they

5247.52 --> 5253.1990000000005
don't geometrically yeah i know

5250.08 --> 5256.88
so yes indeed spheres have edges it's

5253.199 --> 5256.879999999999
not geometrical edges i know

5257.84 --> 5262.0
hey an apparent edges are edges too they

5260.8 --> 5267.76
appear don't they

5262.0 --> 5270.08
there's something there

5267.76 --> 5271.92
it's just a different field it's not the

5270.08 --> 5274.96
field of geometry

5271.92 --> 5278.4800000000005
it's optics but it's there

5274.96 --> 5281.84
it does have an edge in optics

5278.48 --> 5281.839999999999
there is an edge to a sphere

5282.08 --> 5287.12
yeah this is not actual it's apparent

5286.239 --> 5290.799999999999
not actual

5287.12 --> 5290.8
really apparent not actual

5291.199 --> 5294.879999999999
now i'm pretty sure they do they do have

5293.44 --> 5298.638999999999
a an

5294.88 --> 5299.28
edge it's just it is actual it is an

5298.639 --> 5303.28
actual

5299.28 --> 5308.0
edge right it's an actual edge

5303.28 --> 5311.679
it's just not a geometric edge

5308.0 --> 5312.8
an edge within sight that makes it

5311.679 --> 5315.92
apparent

5312.8 --> 5319.52
but in this case a parent is not

5315.92 --> 5322.719
the opposite of not actual

5319.52 --> 5327.52
because we're not trying to

5322.719 --> 5329.199
basically get a geometric edge out of it

5327.52 --> 5330.96
we're getting a different type of edge

5329.199 --> 5333.199
out of it

5330.96 --> 5336.2390000000005
how many times do you need to repeat

5333.199 --> 5339.5199999999995
this for yourself over and over again

5336.239 --> 5339.5199999999995
it's getting really silly

5345.36 --> 5350.639
spheres don't have the edge it's only in

5348.96 --> 5352.719
your vision or when

5350.639 --> 5354.2390000000005
even five-year-olds understand this yeah

5352.719 --> 5357.04
yeah well

5354.239 --> 5358.159
yeah you seem to have a lot of trouble

5357.04 --> 5361.6
about it though because

5358.159 --> 5365.12
you keep on telling me how spheres

5361.6 --> 5368.88
don't have edges and then they do

5365.12 --> 5370.88
in vision so you keep saying it doesn't

5368.88 --> 5373.1990000000005
have an edge but it does

5370.88 --> 5375.1990000000005
so easy to understand yeah well you seem

5373.199 --> 5378.08
to have a lot of trouble with it

5375.199 --> 5378.879999999999
with the fact that you keep telling me

5378.08 --> 5382.08
that spheres

5378.88 --> 5385.28
do indeed have edges

5382.08 --> 5387.199
apparent edges edges within sight right

5385.28 --> 5389.28
you keep telling me and then telling me

5387.199 --> 5392.638999999999
how they don't have edges

5389.28 --> 5394.8
maybe you should yeah get some uh

5392.639 --> 5407.84
psychological help with that because

5394.8 --> 5407.84
it's getting really glaring

5418.159 --> 5421.92
man dealing with ballers guys it really

5421.52 --> 5427.280000000001
is

5421.92 --> 5427.28
just a lunatic asylum sometimes

5428.719 --> 5432.56
though it's not every day though it

5430.719 --> 5434.159
depends on what you're going to bring to

5432.56 --> 5435.84
the table but this guy is just

5434.159 --> 5438.719
constantly telling me spheres don't have

5435.84 --> 5440.56
edges look c spheres have edges

5438.719 --> 5441.76
so that means they don't have edges

5440.56 --> 5444.400000000001
because

5441.76 --> 5446.08
that one edge is not a real edge it

5444.4 --> 5450.4
doesn't exist even though i keep

5446.08 --> 5454.239
pointing out how it is an edge

5450.4 --> 5456.32
it's not an edge it seems like you can't

5454.239 --> 5458.799999999999
get your head out of the geometry

5456.32 --> 5461.04
there's other things beyond geometry you

5458.8 --> 5463.1990000000005
do realize that right

5461.04 --> 5464.32
well you do because you keep telling me

5463.199 --> 5467.678999999999
there is and then

5464.32 --> 5468.0
denying the thing that you shared with

5467.679 --> 5472.639
me

5468.0 --> 5472.639
exists it's it's very

5474.159 --> 5477.839999999999
it's very sad

5478.719 --> 5483.6
here he goes again spheres don't have an

5481.84 --> 5486.639
edge it's only in your vision

5483.6 --> 5490.4800000000005
five-year-olds understand this yeah yeah

5486.639 --> 5493.52
copy paste it say it i don't

5490.48 --> 5495.5199999999995
say the sphere has an edge i say it

5493.52 --> 5498.96
appears so

5495.52 --> 5500.56
so it's not double speaking you're just

5498.96 --> 5504.2390000000005
too dense to understand it's

5500.56 --> 5505.120000000001
inside it's not an actual sphere with an

5504.239 --> 5510.0
edge

5505.12 --> 5512.4
it's not an actual sphere within it what

5510.0 --> 5516.08
so wait you're saying that a sphere is

5512.4 --> 5516.08
not actually a sphere

5516.32 --> 5521.12
it's not the actual sphere with an edge

5519.28 --> 5524.719
what

5521.12 --> 5528.159
what i'm pretty sure that spheres do

5524.719 --> 5530.88
have edges it's just not geometric edges

5528.159 --> 5531.5199999999995
you've already conceded to that at the

5530.88 --> 5535.76
edge

5531.52 --> 5536.320000000001
appears when involving optics so when

5535.76 --> 5538.88
you look

5536.32 --> 5540.799999999999
at the sphere it does have an edge it's

5538.88 --> 5544.719
a demarcation

5540.8 --> 5547.52
as to where the object sphere

5544.719 --> 5549.52
obstruct things beyond it visually

5547.52 --> 5552.56
that's where the edge is

5549.52 --> 5554.400000000001
right so you've already conceded this

5552.56 --> 5558.0
and just because it's

5554.4 --> 5559.839999999999
a visual type of edge doesn't mean it's

5558.0 --> 5561.04
not an edge and you've even conceded

5559.84 --> 5563.1990000000005
this

5561.04 --> 5565.5199999999995
but then you constantly within the same

5563.199 --> 5566.08
sentence keep on rolling it back saying

5565.52 --> 5568.2390000000005
but no

5566.08 --> 5569.76
because it's apparent that means it's

5568.239 --> 5571.919999999999
not an actual edge

5569.76 --> 5573.04
even though i've already conceded it is

5571.92 --> 5575.04
an edge

5573.04 --> 5576.32
but because it's apparent and not

5575.04 --> 5579.28
geometric

5576.32 --> 5581.679
it's not an edge because apparently

5579.28 --> 5583.12
beyond geometry things don't really

5581.679 --> 5589.84
exist

5583.12 --> 5589.84
according to you

5600.56 --> 5606.159000000001
if i was to set you some basic geometry

5603.6 --> 5609.679
questions do you think you'd perform

5606.159 --> 5612.719
well i keep on telling you natural

5609.679 --> 5615.1990000000005
consequences of geometry

5612.719 --> 5616.0
special especially spherical geometry

5615.199 --> 5618.879999999999
and tell you how

5616.0 --> 5620.08
spheres do actually have an edge outside

5618.88 --> 5623.52
of geometry

5620.08 --> 5628.0
right geometric things

5623.52 --> 5631.1990000000005
sometimes have certain non-geometric

5628.0 --> 5633.92
elements to them things

5631.199 --> 5634.96
that are absolutely connected and

5633.92 --> 5638.159
persistent

5634.96 --> 5641.52
in their mechanics outside

5638.159 --> 5644.799999999999
of the geometry like for example

5641.52 --> 5649.040000000001
visually geometry of things

5644.8 --> 5651.1990000000005
has very specific visual consequences

5649.04 --> 5653.679
it's funny how that works out isn't it

5651.199 --> 5656.48
so things exist

5653.679 --> 5659.6
beyond geometry i know it's really tough

5656.48 --> 5663.28
for some people to realize that

5659.6 --> 5666.0
but just because there is an aspect

5663.28 --> 5668.88
of something that is geometrical that

5666.0 --> 5672.4
lies outside of geometry

5668.88 --> 5676.0
doesn't mean it doesn't exist

5672.4 --> 5679.199
it means there is a factor

5676.0 --> 5681.84
to the geometry that lies outside of the

5679.199 --> 5684.159
field of geometry that is persistently

5681.84 --> 5687.679
there

5684.159 --> 5691.119
one of these examples is the visual

5687.679 --> 5693.28
edge of the sphere

5691.119 --> 5695.199
but you can't handle it you keep on

5693.28 --> 5697.119
telling me how it does have an edge but

5695.199 --> 5697.599999999999
it's only apparent so it doesn't have an

5697.119 --> 5701.199
edge

5697.6 --> 5705.84
which is just brutal multi-tier

5701.199 --> 5705.839999999999
multi-layer double speak to yourself

5707.119 --> 5711.28
because it seems so it only appears to

5710.32 --> 5715.84
have an edge

5711.28 --> 5715.84
so it has an edge then

5716.4 --> 5720.239
it has an edge because you can see the

5718.4 --> 5723.28
edge it's the edge

5720.239 --> 5724.718999999999
that demarcates where the spherical

5723.28 --> 5729.04
object

5724.719 --> 5732.08
obstructs things beyond it from sight

5729.04 --> 5735.84
yeah visual edge of the sphere

5732.08 --> 5738.96
so it has an edge see

5735.84 --> 5739.92
so so tell me so tell me then red p red

5738.96 --> 5741.76
pill trill

5739.92 --> 5742.96
tell me how i need to do some tests i

5741.76 --> 5745.04
need to qualify

5742.96 --> 5746.639
i need to qualify i can't be saying all

5745.04 --> 5749.84
of this i can be

5746.639 --> 5751.4400000000005
claiming that geometrical spheres have

5749.84 --> 5753.92
non-geometric edges

5751.44 --> 5754.48
how dare i i must do some tests now i

5753.92 --> 5757.1990000000005
must

5754.48 --> 5758.48
prove my qualifications i can't be

5757.199 --> 5760.799999999999
teaching this

5758.48 --> 5761.5199999999995
how dare i i can't say that spheres have

5760.8 --> 5764.56
edges

5761.52 --> 5766.8
outside of geometry how dare i right i

5764.56 --> 5768.639
have to do all these tests now to prove

5766.8 --> 5772.159000000001
that i'm qualified enough

5768.639 --> 5775.52
to bring you this information

5772.159 --> 5778.4
right because i can't just say that

5775.52 --> 5785.84
spheres have edges outside of geometry

5778.4 --> 5785.839999999999
it's really difficult for some people

5789.44 --> 5793.36
it's not double speaking no double speak

5792.08 --> 5796.84
oh look at them

5793.36 --> 5798.799999999999
look at them squirm this is incredible

5796.84 --> 5802.96
man

5798.8 --> 5805.4400000000005
like you guys are such fanatical

5802.96 --> 5808.08
you're so fanatical about your religious

5805.44 --> 5808.08
views that

5808.48 --> 5812.32
i've already predicted this way back but

5810.639 --> 5814.2390000000005
if push comes to shove

5812.32 --> 5815.92
you guys are all going to be suicide

5814.239 --> 5819.04
bombers

5815.92 --> 5821.1990000000005
by your own decision

5819.04 --> 5823.04
you're already kind of doing it

5821.199 --> 5824.799999999999
intellectually you're intellectual

5823.04 --> 5827.5199999999995
suicide bombers

5824.8 --> 5829.52
you literally break people up with

5827.52 --> 5831.84
absolute double speak nonsense and

5829.52 --> 5833.280000000001
confusion and lies and peer pressure and

5831.84 --> 5837.1990000000005
whatever you can

5833.28 --> 5841.599999999999
not even to get yourself out as a winner

5837.199 --> 5845.599999999999
not even to win but just to destroy

5841.6 --> 5847.84
the enemy destroy their power destroy

5845.6 --> 5849.84
their cohesion destroy their argument

5847.84 --> 5851.1990000000005
whatever you can get a hold of you don't

5849.84 --> 5854.719
care about yourself

5851.199 --> 5859.119
anymore even in the face of just

5854.719 --> 5861.52
the opponent that denies your religion

5859.119 --> 5862.5599999999995
you guys are all intellectual suicide

5861.52 --> 5864.56
bombers

5862.56 --> 5866.4800000000005
and who knows where that will actually

5864.56 --> 5867.119000000001
bring you in the real world at some

5866.48 --> 5869.599999999999
point

5867.119 --> 5871.04
when your religion is actually exposed

5869.6 --> 5871.6
how about that what you're going to do

5871.04 --> 5872.8
then

5871.6 --> 5875.04
what you're going to do then when the

5872.8 --> 5877.28
world's not actually

5875.04 --> 5878.719
giving in to your stupid trickery that

5877.28 --> 5881.44
you were conditioned with

5878.719 --> 5882.0
in school that you're supposedly smart

5881.44 --> 5884.48
if you think

5882.0 --> 5885.6
the earth is a ball and defend that

5884.48 --> 5888.08
concept

5885.6 --> 5889.360000000001
and push people around because they

5888.08 --> 5891.76
believe something else

5889.36 --> 5895.44
what you're going to do then you think

5891.76 --> 5895.4400000000005
your double speak is going to save you

5895.52 --> 5900.320000000001
i don't think so your double speak is

5898.0 --> 5903.76
not going to save you

5900.32 --> 5906.48
when people are getting kind of sick

5903.76 --> 5908.8
of this double speak nonsense and like

5906.48 --> 5911.919999999999
it's not going to be accepted anymore

5908.8 --> 5912.320000000001
what you're gonna do then right because

5911.92 --> 5914.719
these

5912.32 --> 5916.799999999999
intellectual suicide bomber runs that

5914.719 --> 5919.76
you keep on doing here

5916.8 --> 5921.04
they're not helping really all they've

5919.76 --> 5923.84
caused

5921.04 --> 5925.36
is us to grow thicker skin and to get

5923.84 --> 5928.08
some blast paddings and

5925.36 --> 5929.0
intellectual blast padding to expect

5928.08 --> 5932.48
people to

5929.0 --> 5935.52
absolutely basically commit suicide

5932.48 --> 5938.0
shocking like commit terror attacks by

5935.52 --> 5940.400000000001
self-torture in plain sight just

5938.0 --> 5943.52
exposure to insanity and horror

5940.4 --> 5944.239
that's your tactics just showing

5943.52 --> 5947.76
yourself

5944.239 --> 5948.32
literally jabbing knives into your own

5947.76 --> 5952.320000000001
freaking

5948.32 --> 5954.719
face to show you that you

5952.32 --> 5956.88
don't care you don't care about cohesion

5954.719 --> 5957.679
you don't care about logic only thing

5956.88 --> 5961.119
you care about

5957.679 --> 5964.8
is the goal the goal that everyone

5961.119 --> 5967.36
must believe the earth is a sphere

5964.8 --> 5967.84
despite all the evidence against it and

5967.36 --> 5970.88
you'll

5967.84 --> 5971.92
attack language you attack the very

5970.88 --> 5975.04
foundational

5971.92 --> 5979.119
meanings of every logic

5975.04 --> 5982.0
form out there in order to achieve it

5979.119 --> 5984.239
intellectual suicide bombers is what you

5982.0 --> 5984.239
are

5988.08 --> 5991.92
layla stop talking like that please it's

5990.88 --> 5995.84
edgy

5991.92 --> 5995.84
yeah that's a funny one

6003.92 --> 6010.2390000000005
yeah i know it's tough hearing that

6007.84 --> 6010.2390000000005
isn't it

6015.36 --> 6019.28
yeah and sorry here we go again i know

6018.159 --> 6023.44
that sometimes

6019.28 --> 6026.159
you just gotta

6023.44 --> 6027.599999999999
i don't know you gotta cook some glowers

6026.159 --> 6029.679
just gonna

6027.6 --> 6032.0
squish them up it's just like meatloaf

6029.679 --> 6035.119
you know the the more you squeeze it

6032.0 --> 6037.52
the more you handle it the better it

6035.119 --> 6041.36
starts to taste afterward

6037.52 --> 6041.360000000001
so you're just gonna wrangle them up

6041.6 --> 6046.4800000000005
and yeah the best way to do it sometimes

6044.96 --> 6049.04
not all the time because then gets

6046.48 --> 6052.4
tiresome but sometimes you just gotta

6049.04 --> 6054.4
ram the same thing in their heads

6052.4 --> 6056.159
over and over and over again and then

6054.4 --> 6059.36
make them squirt

6056.159 --> 6060.0
make them react with double speak make

6059.36 --> 6062.799999999999
them

6060.0 --> 6062.8
defend

6063.679 --> 6067.1990000000005
their false position

6067.28 --> 6070.639
and yet make them blurt out the most

6069.6 --> 6073.6
nonsensical

6070.639 --> 6075.28
garbage the world has ever seen without

6073.6 --> 6077.92
even realizing it and then

6075.28 --> 6079.599999999999
shoving that garbage in their face it's

6077.92 --> 6080.4
like oh they puke well you shove their

6079.6 --> 6082.56
face in it

6080.4 --> 6084.32
just shove the face in the puke just

6082.56 --> 6084.719
show like that's that's what came out of

6084.32 --> 6088.0
you

6084.719 --> 6090.56
that's what you just did yeah

6088.0 --> 6091.44
they don't know no it's oh if it's just

6090.56 --> 6095.04
sick it's

6091.44 --> 6097.599999999999
all for a good reason it's it's normal

6095.04 --> 6099.92
no no it's not it's not normal it's

6097.6 --> 6104.4800000000005
insane

6099.92 --> 6107.1990000000005
people are insane spend a lot of time

6104.48 --> 6108.48
denying something then affirming

6107.199 --> 6111.119
something

6108.48 --> 6112.0
confirming it and denying it at the same

6111.119 --> 6115.599999999999
time

6112.0 --> 6118.639
and then eventually complaining about

6115.6 --> 6121.76
how the meaning of words are not

6118.639 --> 6124.4800000000005
actually the meaning of words anymore

6121.76 --> 6126.2390000000005
so no i didn't mean that i oh yeah you

6124.48 --> 6129.44
did you did

6126.239 --> 6130.638999999999
you got triggered you saw spheres don't

6129.44 --> 6133.04
have edges

6130.639 --> 6135.1990000000005
you couldn't get your mind outside of

6133.04 --> 6138.32
the field of geometry

6135.199 --> 6141.28
even though i constantly emphasize

6138.32 --> 6142.239
that spheres don't have geometric edges

6141.28 --> 6145.92
the edge

6142.239 --> 6149.44
geometric spheres have are not geometric

6145.92 --> 6152.4800000000005
they're optics based right so you kept

6149.44 --> 6155.44
on just going and going and going and

6152.48 --> 6156.799999999999
keep on saying spheres don't have edges

6155.44 --> 6158.799999999999
oh

6156.8 --> 6160.4800000000005
yeah spheres do have edges they're just

6158.8 --> 6162.639
not geometric edges see

6160.48 --> 6164.0
see still he's doing it and now he's

6162.639 --> 6167.76
trying to gaslight me

6164.0 --> 6168.88
with gaslighting so it's just a 180

6167.76 --> 6171.6
degree projection

6168.88 --> 6171.6
constantly

6173.04 --> 6177.92
yeah i know i know spheres don't have

6175.52 --> 6182.080000000001
geometric edges i already told you that

6177.92 --> 6183.84
guess who but you keep chanting for me

6182.08 --> 6186.8
keep chanting like you've gotta win i

6183.84 --> 6189.04
never claimed they had geometric edges

6186.8 --> 6190.88
i claimed they had edges though just not

6189.04 --> 6193.119
geometric

6190.88 --> 6195.6
yeah it's so tough for you you can't

6193.119 --> 6195.599999999999
handle it

6198.8 --> 6204.400000000001
that is polite way of denying evidence

6201.679 --> 6207.679
oh really so are you denying

6204.4 --> 6209.679
that when you look at a sphere that they

6207.679 --> 6213.28
have an edge

6209.679 --> 6215.1990000000005
the demarcation of the sphere

6213.28 --> 6217.5199999999995
where it starts to obstruct things

6215.199 --> 6219.5199999999995
behind it so that you can't see them

6217.52 --> 6222.0
that's called the edge that's an edge of

6219.52 --> 6222.0
a sphere

6229.28 --> 6236.88
oh you're gonna pay me shut up dude

6233.679 --> 6237.84
i don't need your stupid tests the test

6236.88 --> 6239.92
is my show

6237.84 --> 6242.400000000001
it's your test it's your test to see

6239.92 --> 6245.84
what you got inside of you

6242.4 --> 6248.96
how are you gonna deal

6245.84 --> 6250.56
very basic problems that you're going to

6248.96 --> 6252.32
be confronted with

6250.56 --> 6253.92
are you going to fundamentally at the

6252.32 --> 6257.199
rudimentary

6253.92 --> 6260.4
grassroots of your very foundational

6257.199 --> 6262.638999999999
understanding not the [ __ ] you've you've

6260.4 --> 6264.4
piled in there over the ages which is

6262.639 --> 6266.96
your original

6264.4 --> 6267.679
beginnings of understanding let's see

6266.96 --> 6269.76
how you just

6267.679 --> 6271.6
[ __ ] around with that keep on double

6269.76 --> 6273.4400000000005
speaking keep on saying something and

6271.6 --> 6275.92
then denying it and then laughing and

6273.44 --> 6279.599999999999
then telling me how i'm stupid

6275.92 --> 6279.6
for something that i haven't claimed

6284.88 --> 6288.2390000000005
oh it only appears now it does have an

6287.679 --> 6290.08
edge

6288.239 --> 6291.839999999999
the edge is just not geometric

6290.08 --> 6294.4
turtledove

6291.84 --> 6295.360000000001
it does have an edge because when you

6294.4 --> 6298.638999999999
look at it

6295.36 --> 6302.239
that edge is the demarcation line

6298.639 --> 6305.4400000000005
between the geometric sphere

6302.239 --> 6307.759999999999
and not the geometric sphere you could

6305.44 --> 6311.28
call it a horizon

6307.76 --> 6314.96
it's a geometric horizon perhaps

6311.28 --> 6317.759999999999
right now the edge

6314.96 --> 6319.199
is not geometric but the horizon would

6317.76 --> 6321.4400000000005
be geometric

6319.199 --> 6322.799999999999
it's a little tough isn't it it's like

6321.44 --> 6325.36
oh the words is

6322.8 --> 6327.1990000000005
almost the same almost but they have a

6325.36 --> 6329.599999999999
completely different

6327.199 --> 6331.919999999999
function within the setup it's very

6329.6 --> 6334.8
difficult to keep that apart isn't it

6331.92 --> 6336.56
right so a geometric sphere has a

6334.8 --> 6340.6
geometric horizon

6336.56 --> 6342.320000000001
the geometric horizon is effectively the

6340.6 --> 6346.8
non-geometric

6342.32 --> 6349.92
edge of the sphere yeah

6346.8 --> 6349.92
isn't that just special

6350.56 --> 6354.320000000001
look look at how triggered everybody is

6352.56 --> 6356.320000000001
i totally get it by the way if

6354.32 --> 6358.32
the flat earthers out there are just

6356.32 --> 6359.92
gonna go i totally get it

6358.32 --> 6362.88
because these people in my chat right

6359.92 --> 6366.32
now are just squirting

6362.88 --> 6369.92
big time big time

6366.32 --> 6371.92
big big big time they can't handle it

6369.92 --> 6373.1990000000005
yeah keep telling me how keep telling me

6371.92 --> 6375.52
turtledove

6373.199 --> 6377.119
you're not the first one keep telling me

6375.52 --> 6379.280000000001
keep telling me spheres don't have

6377.119 --> 6381.759999999999
geometrical edges go on our wind spheres

6379.28 --> 6383.92
don't have cuban catches come on

6381.76 --> 6386.400000000001
stop saying they have edges spheres

6383.92 --> 6388.96
don't have geometric edges yeah i know i

6386.4 --> 6392.48
never claimed they had geometric edges

6388.96 --> 6394.88
they do have edges though yeah

6392.48 --> 6395.919999999999
so keep chanting for me keep chanting

6394.88 --> 6399.36
for me

6395.92 --> 6401.36
tell me oh come on irwin spears don't

6399.36 --> 6403.599999999999
have geometric edges stop

6401.36 --> 6404.48
saying that i'm not saying that i never

6403.6 --> 6407.76
said that

6404.48 --> 6410.08
i just said that they have edges

6407.76 --> 6411.52
those edges are just not geometric

6410.08 --> 6415.199
though i know it's so

6411.52 --> 6418.2390000000005
hard keep squirting for me come on

6415.199 --> 6420.879999999999
do it come on tell me

6418.239 --> 6422.48
tell me how spheres don't have geometric

6420.88 --> 6426.4800000000005
edges tell me come on

6422.48 --> 6429.839999999999
tell me some more yeah

6426.48 --> 6432.239
i got 10 more minutes of this [ __ ]

6429.84 --> 6433.76
tell me tell me how spheres don't have

6432.239 --> 6438.638999999999
geometric edges

6433.76 --> 6441.119000000001
i know i know i know

6438.639 --> 6442.8
they do have edges though just not

6441.119 --> 6447.36
geometric edges

6442.8 --> 6451.28
yeah the geometric horizon

6447.36 --> 6454.96
of a geometric sphere is

6451.28 --> 6459.84
a sphere edge the edge

6454.96 --> 6463.199
the nature of this edge is not geometric

6459.84 --> 6466.639
it's optical right

6463.199 --> 6470.239
because the geometric horizon

6466.639 --> 6473.84
of the geometric sphere also has other

6470.239 --> 6474.959999999999
effects elements to them optical for

6473.84 --> 6478.0
example

6474.96 --> 6479.28
right so these two distinct geometric

6478.0 --> 6482.719
things with geometry

6479.28 --> 6487.84
in the name have non

6482.719 --> 6487.84
geometric elements to them like an edge

6488.32 --> 6493.119
see you see

6496.88 --> 6500.56
yeah adam meekin oh so good to have you

6499.44 --> 6502.638999999999
here

6500.56 --> 6504.639
i've been rambling literally about this

6502.639 --> 6507.76
for over one and a half hour it's

6504.639 --> 6510.4800000000005
it's kind of yeah

6507.76 --> 6511.6
it's kind of numbing me a little but i

6510.48 --> 6514.799999999999
think this

6511.6 --> 6515.679
i really hit on a very painful point i

6514.8 --> 6518.56
have never

6515.679 --> 6521.52
seen this level of cognitive dissonance

6518.56 --> 6521.52
before in chat

6525.679 --> 6532.2390000000005
yeah but with the no edge that's

6528.96 --> 6534.4
that's within the geometry right it's

6532.239 --> 6535.839999999999
within the geometry it's a tangent and

6534.4 --> 6540.48
all that right

6535.84 --> 6542.96
well i was talking about how spheres

6540.48 --> 6545.36
with the geometric horizon and the

6542.96 --> 6548.8
sphere itself being geometric

6545.36 --> 6551.36
doesn't have geometric edges

6548.8 --> 6552.719
it has visual edges because a geometric

6551.36 --> 6555.839999999999
edge you see

6552.719 --> 6557.52
is like a geometric aspect

6555.84 --> 6559.92
that the sphere doesn't have because it

6557.52 --> 6561.76
doesn't have edges according to google

6559.92 --> 6563.92
and that is technically correct it

6561.76 --> 6566.84
doesn't have geometric edges

6563.92 --> 6568.8
the sphere but it does have an edge

6566.84 --> 6572.2390000000005
though

6568.8 --> 6573.92
the edge is non-geometric it is still an

6572.239 --> 6577.199
edge though it does

6573.92 --> 6579.1990000000005
have it spheres do have edges it's just

6577.199 --> 6582.719
not a geometric edge it's a different

6579.199 --> 6587.28
type of edge

6582.719 --> 6587.28
what do you say adam

6592.48 --> 6597.5199999999995
oh my god look at this guy see he

6595.36 --> 6598.48
doesn't even understand that there is

6597.52 --> 6602.2390000000005
any sort of

6598.48 --> 6605.919999999999
edge beyond geometric

6602.239 --> 6609.04
he literally reifies every form of edge

6605.92 --> 6611.84
into a geometric edge and he keeps on

6609.04 --> 6611.84
saying it

6621.119 --> 6624.5599999999995
that's right that's right that's exactly

6623.599 --> 6628.2390000000005
the obstruct

6624.56 --> 6632.639
yeah the edge the edge a sphere has

6628.239 --> 6635.919999999999
is the demarcation line between

6632.639 --> 6639.52
the sphere itself and that which

6635.92 --> 6641.76
is it visually blocks that's the edge of

6639.52 --> 6644.96
the sphere it's not the geometric edge

6641.76 --> 6648.159000000001
but it is there and it is inherent to

6644.96 --> 6649.92
things that are geometric i'm

6648.159 --> 6652.239
trying to explain this to these people

6649.92 --> 6654.88
and they are just squirting over the

6652.239 --> 6656.718999999999
chat it's unbelievable

6654.88 --> 6658.4800000000005
and i'm all leaving it they're not not

6656.719 --> 6661.679
giving it a timeout because it's just

6658.48 --> 6661.678999999999
too special it's too

6662.159 --> 6668.159
too telling to remove it

6666.0 --> 6670.08
i want people to see that i want people

6668.159 --> 6672.32
to see how much

6670.08 --> 6673.36
cognitive pain some people reside in

6672.32 --> 6677.28
when it comes to

6673.36 --> 6681.839999999999
really rudimentary things

6677.28 --> 6681.84
it's unbelievable

6698.719 --> 6704.4
anyway i'm gonna stop it because

6702.32 --> 6707.36
this guy is never gonna learn i don't

6704.4 --> 6709.5199999999995
even know if he's a person at this point

6707.36 --> 6712.48
probably is only a person could be that

6709.52 --> 6714.719
stupid bots can't be

6712.48 --> 6716.0
like stupid you can't program real

6714.719 --> 6718.88
stupidity

6716.0 --> 6720.0
you can program repetitiveness but not

6718.88 --> 6723.04
genuine

6720.0 --> 6724.639
cognitive pain that some only humans can

6723.04 --> 6728.08
be that stupid

6724.639 --> 6730.8
right so

6728.08 --> 6733.04
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6730.8 --> 6735.360000000001
like this show

6733.04 --> 6736.32
oh yeah and a reminder spheres have

6735.36 --> 6738.88
edges right

6736.32 --> 6740.08
it's just not geometric edges just one

6738.88 --> 6743.28
last time

6740.08 --> 6746.239
just wanted to clear that up right

6743.28 --> 6748.48
