patreon so today's weather is well right

74.49 --> 80.21
now just now there's a little bit of a

76.59 --> 85.13
cloud getting in front of the daylight

80.21 --> 89.06899999999999
but it's a pretty beautiful day and I

85.13 --> 91.74
thought I did catch some cam trailing

89.069 --> 96.42
going on this morning with definite

91.74 --> 99.08
cross stripes that lingered but I don't

96.42 --> 104.58
know what happened to them I don't

99.08 --> 106.56
really see the typical correlating hey

104.58 --> 110.039
so I'm kind of surprised about that and

106.56 --> 115.379
instead we've got all these fluffy

110.039 --> 120.47
clouds a very picturesque you can almost

115.379 --> 120.47
like grab them you know it's like

123.99 --> 134.35
yeah yeah very pretty and yeah surprise

131.92 --> 139.29999999999998
something else oh the wind is a lot

134.35 --> 141.97
fresher so I did actually go out get

139.3 --> 144.31
groceries in my t-shirt but yeah

141.97 --> 146.8
with the wind it sometimes got a bit

144.31 --> 148.95
fresh but it's really nice it's better

146.8 --> 157.51000000000002
than yesterday and the day before that

148.95 --> 164.73999999999998
so I'm it's nice it feels like summer so

157.51 --> 170.67999999999998
how you guys all and gals all doing let

164.74 --> 173.19
me see who is in chat just double

170.68 --> 177.52

173.19 --> 184.96
yeah stone monkey 3d was in there Ragnar

177.52 --> 189.209

Trish that you are a girl let me see let

203.34 --> 206.479
[Music]

207.209 --> 214.69
okay well that's not player at all

210.81 --> 217.9
although the female in the picture seems

214.69 --> 223.93
to be the most central thing in your

217.9 --> 230.019
item so I lost this morning all right

223.93 --> 233.29000000000002
good to know I'm just checking I've

230.019 --> 235.989
mistaken people in chat just by looking

233.29 --> 237.60999999999999
at their name for males and then they

235.989 --> 244.599
turn out to be female and I was like

237.61 --> 249.34
what Oh get out confused so I'm just

244.599 --> 253.0
trying to make sure it's not your

249.34 --> 259.45
picture you did you don't know how to do

253.0 --> 264.58
that it's not that difficult really but

259.45 --> 266.94
you have to get like onto a browser to

264.58 --> 266.94
do it

273.69 --> 281.31
right well if you add me on skype then

277.71 --> 284.64
I'll explain it to you info if you want

281.31 --> 287.31
it's yeah these are like these small

284.64 --> 289.95
tiny things if you have no idea how to

287.31 --> 291.54
do it then yeah you're lost but it's not

289.95 --> 293.72999999999996
really that hard once you get to know

291.54 --> 296.55
the little trick you just have to know

293.73 --> 299.52000000000004
where to find it because YouTube and

296.55 --> 302.97
Google and all that is is a giant mess

299.52 --> 304.77
it's like a giant tree of things that

302.97 --> 307.14000000000004
look just branch in all direction

304.77 --> 310.08
seemingly randomly sometimes it's really

307.14 --> 313.38
confusing to figure out where to go to

310.08 --> 315.71999999999997
do certain things but yeah if you keep

313.38 --> 318.6
on digging eventually you'll get the

315.72 --> 320.34000000000003
oversight and you'll just be like oh my

318.6 --> 327.84000000000003
god this is ridiculous but at least I

320.34 --> 330.96
know how to work with it I can I can do

327.84 --> 338.58
it from my PC I can't do it for you

330.96 --> 341.58
though but if you if we Skype call for

338.58 --> 343.65
four for example or I'm gonna look it up

341.58 --> 347.28
how to do it and then just give you a

343.65 --> 349.46999999999997
verbal explanation in the chat and we'll

347.28 --> 351.67999999999995
get you a picture it's not that

349.47 --> 351.68
difficult

353.46 --> 356.72999999999996
[Music]

357.61 --> 364.52000000000004
right well don't blame yourself Trish

361.419 --> 368.539
like I consider myself to be pretty

364.52 --> 371.839
smart but when it comes to interfacing

368.539 --> 374.349
with programs and everything I am really

371.839 --> 377.809
not that smart

374.349 --> 381.199
I'm just once I get to know a few tricks

377.809 --> 383.77900000000005
and I keep on working with that it just

381.199 --> 386.449
becomes second nature but it's really

383.779 --> 388.49
hard for me to engage in new things and

386.449 --> 392.349
I always get these weird haze of

388.49 --> 394.009
confusion it's like an unrest I

392.349 --> 397.52
originally thought it was like

394.009 --> 401.12
hyperactivity related but it seems to be

397.52 --> 404.12
more inner conflict like fear of

401.12 --> 405.8
something new it's very primal it feels

404.12 --> 408.74
to me that experience I don't know it

405.8 --> 411.259
this sounds really weird but for me it

408.74 --> 413.27
just is difficult to do new things on

411.259 --> 416.899
average it always has been and I used to

413.27 --> 419.87
punish myself for that really badly like

416.899 --> 422.029
oh my god you stupid [ __ ] and I would

419.87 --> 423.979
take the [ __ ] literally because slow

422.029 --> 428.389
you're slowing yourself down why are you

423.979 --> 429.83
not doing new things but yeah punishing

428.389 --> 432.729
yourself over that doesn't happen

429.83 --> 432.729
doesn't really help

437.6 --> 440.6
so

441.11 --> 445.72900000000004
just figure out how to get yourself to

444.05 --> 448.699
do these new things and for me that's

445.729 --> 452.27
always been it just has to be important

448.699 --> 454.61
enough and for things to be able to be

452.27 --> 457.00899999999996
important enough I have to be focused

454.61 --> 459.11
I have to be and for that I am basically

457.009 --> 460.819
following the path it is like a

459.11 --> 464.69
religious personal thing but it also

460.819 --> 467.389
helps with that because you need clarity

464.69 --> 469.31
if you're not clear then your egos just

467.389 --> 471.139
gonna make you deviate instantly and

469.31 --> 474.37
find some reason to do something else

471.139 --> 476.84000000000003
that used to happen to me constantly

474.37 --> 480.919
basically in the first 20 years of my

476.84 --> 483.919
life and it really felt like a curse

480.919 --> 486.919
it really did because it made me walk

483.919 --> 489.43
away from things that just could have

486.919 --> 489.43
been great

495.73 --> 505.51
but it was because of my yeah my spirit

502.48 --> 509.04
was not in the right place my heart may

505.51 --> 509.03999999999996
have been sort of in the right place

510.78 --> 517.75
there was some faith there to guide me

514.3 --> 525.31
through it but my spirit like I was

517.75 --> 528.88
basically not clear my worldview was

525.31 --> 530.8599999999999
twisted it twisted in a way just as

528.88 --> 534.04
small children twist toward their

530.86 --> 536.83
worldview and I basically kept on doing

534.04 --> 541.5999999999999
that but because I was so smart

536.83 --> 542.8000000000001
it's not that apparent and also

541.6 --> 545.86
megalomaniacal

542.8 --> 549.04
Akala T came from that and yeah in a way

545.86 --> 551.59
I was kind of crazy but I didn't act out

549.04 --> 557.77
I was mostly just passive-aggressive

551.59 --> 560.2
about it yeah so I'm basically putting

557.77 --> 563.5
down trying to put down like who I used

560.2 --> 566.08
to be which I really can't compare with

563.5 --> 569.95
myself anymore because now I have so

566.08 --> 573.0400000000001
many more aspects things I do routines

569.95 --> 575.6500000000001
that I'm even proud of as I express them

573.04 --> 577.3299999999999
that's why sometimes can get very lively

575.65 --> 581.17
because I'm proud that I'm doing that

577.33 --> 582.94
because way back I would be in

581.17 --> 585.0999999999999
conversations I would be in trains of

582.94 --> 588.9100000000001
thought and I would not have these

585.1 --> 592.48
routines and that made me dwell and that

588.91 --> 595.06
made me just allow considering that

592.48 --> 597.7
there is no purpose there is no God and

595.06 --> 600.01
it's all an illusion and then try to

597.7 --> 604.8100000000001
build something from that which has no

600.01 --> 607.54
foundation that's how I got caught and

604.81 --> 611.4699999999999
all that and then the entire world was

607.54 --> 614.77
basically like handing out stuff to work

611.47 --> 616.72
with from that mindset you know that's

614.77 --> 620.05
been like that for a long time and I was

616.72 --> 622.9
buying it I was freaking buying into

620.05 --> 626.02
society like slavishly

622.9 --> 627.63
and all I wanted basically out of it was

626.02 --> 631.77
to be part

627.63 --> 633.75
of the group such a basic instinct but

631.77 --> 636.03
it was so powerful with me that it would

633.75 --> 642.24
sometimes even drive me to do crazy

636.03 --> 644.6999999999999
things because it's like the this make

642.24 --> 646.41
kind of sound a bit racist I think but

644.7 --> 649.2
it's really a genuine it's like the

646.41 --> 651.36
Chinese instinct I have Chinese blood

649.2 --> 654.6600000000001
just a little so the Chinese don't give

651.36 --> 656.94
a [ __ ] about me I'm not trying to divert

654.66 --> 659.88
your signal or anything but maybe that's

656.94 --> 662.22
what made me like wanna be part of the

659.88 --> 664.41
giant group so badly it's like this

662.22 --> 666.84
instinct that I think a lot of Chinese

664.41 --> 668.88
people have that makes China work the

666.84 --> 673.1700000000001
way it does and I think I may have

668.88 --> 675.3
remnants of this in me but it's not

673.17 --> 679.5
healthy in a society that is basically

675.3 --> 684.51
corrupted because it's burst forth

679.5 --> 689.01
naivety and people and systems are out

684.51 --> 694.77
there just to abuse that so it's I was

689.01 --> 697.86
really out of place in so many ways in

694.77 --> 702.6899999999999
this society and I did feel like a night

697.86 --> 707.37
outcast what is Chinese blood it's

702.69 --> 710.0
genetics it's offspring I have basically

707.37 --> 710.0
what is it

711.02 --> 720.1999999999999
1/16 shinies I think or 1/8 it's not

715.68 --> 723.63
that much but still yeah they have

720.2 --> 727.38
clearly leaked through somewhat but I

723.63 --> 729.21
still do have many especially as I'm

727.38 --> 731.91
growing older I seem to be getting more

729.21 --> 736.44
European features you could say I think

731.91 --> 738.98
at least maybe also the they were maybe

736.44 --> 743.96
the mustache also adds a bit to that

738.98 --> 746.97
maybe my overall attitude I don't know

743.96 --> 750.7800000000001
but when I was a kid like my really kid

746.97 --> 753.36
photos I kind of did have like bit

750.78 --> 755.55
slanty eyes for example it was just

753.36 --> 758.4300000000001
people thought like oh that's like a

755.55 --> 761.29
little half Chinese or something

758.43 --> 764.0699999999999
but as I'm growing older it does really

761.29 --> 764.0699999999999
kind of change

764.97 --> 768.169
[Music]

772.86 --> 780.19
anyway I don't think you guys are really

776.92 --> 786.61
that interested yeah maybe I'm wrong

780.19 --> 792.94
maybe it's just chatting anyway yeah

786.61 --> 795.73
also my dad is not that tall I'm a

792.94 --> 799.36
little bit more tall so I guess that

795.73 --> 802.6
over the generations as we hopefully

799.36 --> 807.13
also family of my dad's like my dad has

802.6 --> 809.14
many brothers and they add kids and not

807.13 --> 812.26
enough of them basically got back into

809.14 --> 815.8
marrying Indonesian or anything no one

812.26 --> 823.42
did I think married somebody from

815.8 --> 828.31
Suriname a black lady but anyway as the

823.42 --> 830.56
old genetics from my yeah nobody I don't

828.31 --> 832.2099999999999
think it's it's all matter of

830.56 --> 835.4799999999999
circumstances but nobody's really

832.21 --> 837.7900000000001
getting back to marrying into Indonesian

835.48 --> 840.4300000000001
which is also part of my bloodline very

837.79 --> 843.91
no everybody knows that in that family

840.43 --> 850.1099999999999
part or Chinese I don't know we're not

843.91 --> 853.24
drawn to it it seems for some reason so

850.11 --> 855.75
the further away the generations become

853.24 --> 860.14
we seem to be getting taller and more of

855.75 --> 865.68
obviously European looking more based in

860.14 --> 867.9399999999999
the typical Dutch and circles Germanic

865.68 --> 870.0999999999999
maybe a bit British here and there

867.94 --> 873.4000000000001
something a little bit French all that

870.1 --> 875.83
those types tend to become more the way

873.4 --> 879.01
that my family looks from my generation

875.83 --> 881.14
and the ones further down the line even

879.01 --> 886.15
more because I do have cousins that do

881.14 --> 888.36
have children also kind of jealous about

886.15 --> 888.36
that

888.62 --> 902.37
but oh well I'm not dead yet hmm but it

900.42 --> 905.8789999999999
was kind of weird also because I think

902.37 --> 908.399
that it sounds sounds kind of weird that

905.879 --> 910.649
in my if when I was very young I was

908.399 --> 913.55
kind of like being treated a bit racist

910.649 --> 917.49
by people there was you were like

913.55 --> 919.68
half-breed really it's like but they did

917.49 --> 921.899
it really to bully but it was like

919.68 --> 923.91
trolling bullying because they I don't

921.899 --> 926.67
think they were really racist they were

923.91 --> 928.499
just really nasty trolling to me in that

926.67 --> 931.2299999999999
time when I was kind of honorable and

928.499 --> 933.66
just trying the size of what the world

931.23 --> 936.3290000000001
was like basically I didn't get it so

933.66 --> 939.569
there was extremely traumatizing to me

936.329 --> 941.37
and I really thought like oh my god I'm

939.569 --> 944.3389999999999
gonna like turn into this ridiculous

941.37 --> 947.91
half Chinese at some point I got over

944.339 --> 949.86
that image and obviously when I look at

947.91 --> 952.499
myself now I'm not looking at oh wow I

949.86 --> 952.92
look like such a half Chinese no not at

952.499 --> 956.97
all

952.92 --> 958.829
I look much less like it like than my

956.97 --> 963.72
dad do even though we do share some

958.829 --> 967.319
certain features anyway I don't even

963.72 --> 970.0690000000001
care you know look not right now if I

967.319 --> 972.509
would have been more Chinese then

970.069 --> 976.259
technically I don't mind it's really

972.509 --> 977.939
only a reflection to that that bullying

976.259 --> 983.3000000000001
when I was little that was kind of

977.939 --> 983.3
ridiculous in retrospect yeah

988.16 --> 993.65
I don't know I'm all over the place with

990.71 --> 995.9300000000001
my things now

993.65 --> 1003.13
I was watching Owen Benjamin by the way

995.93 --> 1009.03
before this was interesting again this

1003.13 --> 1012.13
is ready I think I did share it before I

1009.03 --> 1015.12
don't know I'm just very verbal about my

1012.13 --> 1015.12
background and things

1035.47 --> 1040.509
right Ronnie fashi oh yeah that's so

1038.949 --> 1042.97
funny that you're saying that because

1040.509 --> 1049.379
especially in that time among those

1042.97 --> 1054.82
people oh yeah they were like conspiring

1049.379 --> 1057.039
just to draw curiosity about things they

1054.82 --> 1060.129
were really just being attention grabby

1057.039 --> 1066.549
so badly that they would just conspire

1060.129 --> 1068.74
to hide that nothing from certain

1066.549 --> 1071.23
individuals and then what you would bite

1068.74 --> 1074.35
and I would be typically the guy to bite

1071.23 --> 1078.179
because I hate it when people kept

1074.35 --> 1078.1789999999999
secrets for me and I couldn't stand that

1078.45 --> 1085.3300000000002
I've since come to terms with that that

1082.69 --> 1087.8790000000001
element about humanity but I used to

1085.33 --> 1091.389
hate that so when I they would freaking

1087.879 --> 1093.309
they would fool me with anything I was

1091.389 --> 1096.6689999999999
such a troll bader because I had no

1093.309 --> 1099.07
control I was just I was just

1096.669 --> 1101.5900000000001
chronically bored and I didn't feel like

1099.07 --> 1103.74
I was felt like I was entirely out of

1101.59 --> 1107.47
place sometimes I really was wondering

1103.74 --> 1109.389
it's not even out of depression but it

1107.47 --> 1112.96
was kind of like a discouraged feeling

1109.389 --> 1119.1899999999998
like am I even supposed to be here

1112.96 --> 1124.69
I feel like this doesn't make any sense

1119.19 --> 1127.059
that me with Who I am and my dreams and

1124.69 --> 1129.22
everything that I'm supposed that like

1127.059 --> 1133.08
this world doesn't make any sense

1129.22 --> 1135.309
everybody is just being monsters and

1133.08 --> 1139.48
everybody is being two-faced about

1135.309 --> 1142.71
everything and it just got that kind of

1139.48 --> 1149.6390000000001
corrupted my heart and that that really

1142.71 --> 1149.6390000000001
made yeah cause rage to enter in me

1150.53 --> 1157.11
after that point when I was confronted

1154.23 --> 1160.65
with all that behavior and nobody really

1157.11 --> 1162.33
even noticed that that I saw that and I

1160.65 --> 1164.52
didn't share it with my parents but then

1162.33 --> 1167.22
I started to brood on it and that really

1164.52 --> 1171.45
unleashed a rage in me that's never

1167.22 --> 1174.95
relieved that's never left it's it's

1171.45 --> 1174.95
probably always gonna be a part of me

1176.96 --> 1183.77
and it's it's rage in kind of a

1181.11 --> 1183.77
vengeance

1190.32 --> 1199.9199999999998
but yeah this world does not allow that

1193.05 --> 1208.9199999999998
in any way only monsters allow it and

1199.92 --> 1213.3300000000002
then they abuse it yeah but I was pretty

1208.92 --> 1216.39
sick back then that kids were acting

1213.33 --> 1218.6399999999999
like that before that time I had a

1216.39 --> 1222.7800000000002
problem because I was very little like

1218.64 --> 1224.6100000000001
really young and then everybody around

1222.78 --> 1227.07
me would basically be [ __ ] or

1224.61 --> 1229.74
retreated in their own minds and I just

1227.07 --> 1232.4099999999999
wanted to have interest I wanted to

1229.74 --> 1234.81
basically do science okay that that idea

1232.41 --> 1237.78
I wanted to really get to the hardcore

1234.81 --> 1239.76
knowledge like this freakin block [ __ ]

1237.78 --> 1242.07
in cars is like what the hell I wanna

1239.76 --> 1249.66
freakin learn how to build a nuclear

1242.07 --> 1254.37
reactor you know but then later I

1249.66 --> 1256.65
entered like the big older kids and then

1254.37 --> 1259.8799999999999
they started to do things and it was

1256.65 --> 1264.3300000000002
kind of fun I had more to engage with

1259.88 --> 1269.0700000000002
more to put my energy in and then later

1264.33 --> 1273.4499999999998
like when I entered it was like beyond 9

1269.07 --> 1276.33
that age then people just started to

1273.45 --> 1279.27
behave really devious like they were

1276.33 --> 1283.8
suddenly taught this dark side by their

1279.27 --> 1286.65
parents and they would literally try to

1283.8 --> 1289.44
intimidate you with that [ __ ] and Bluff

1286.65 --> 1291.39
and I was just and that's the thing I

1289.44 --> 1294.42
was talking about that was so shocking

1291.39 --> 1298.1000000000001
to me that that at least like a rage of

1294.42 --> 1298.1000000000001
vengeance feeling that's never gone away

1299.27 --> 1304.02
but it's not like I feel it all the time

1302.19 --> 1307.0800000000002
it's just that's the moment when that

1304.02 --> 1312.1399999999999
arrived it's like the realization that

1307.08 --> 1312.1399999999999
the world is filled with demons and

1313.7 --> 1319.95
anyone can become possessed by them but

1317.64 --> 1322.26
only if you allow it

1319.95 --> 1325.3400000000001
and sometimes the innocent get

1322.26 --> 1327.9
contaminated and they need to be rescued

1325.34 --> 1329.6399999999999
but sometimes somebody's been

1327.9 --> 1333.72
contaminated for so long I have

1329.64 --> 1338.88
sacrificed so much that they can just

1333.72 --> 1342.99
never come back that all of that in a

1338.88 --> 1351.8700000000001
singular moment basically bummed into my

1342.99 --> 1355.56
head like a vision and the rage was the

1351.87 --> 1358.35
response it's like yeah that's you gotta

1355.56 --> 1360.8999999999999
fight for that and it's always been

1358.35 --> 1364.9099999999999
instinctual to me every time and that's

1360.9 --> 1368.66
how I even now it's now turned into more

1364.91 --> 1373.01
conscious use of picking out frequencies

1368.66 --> 1377.76
finding the pure finding those in need

1373.01 --> 1380.7
that actually deserve it recognize the

1377.76 --> 1385.17
symptoms of abusers even just social

1380.7 --> 1387.66
abusers that take things for granted

1385.17 --> 1392.15
for example that's like the lowest here

1387.66 --> 1395.49
but all the signs I recognize all of it

1392.15 --> 1399.27
that's also I guess grown out of that as

1395.49 --> 1402.0
a as a substitute for vengeance just

1399.27 --> 1404.1
learning how to actually deal with it

1402.0 --> 1408.0
and fix something instead of just trying

1404.1 --> 1410.2199999999998
to destroy the evil which tends to then

1408.0 --> 1412.95
create more evil and then people start

1410.22 --> 1414.8700000000001
to see you as evil and then they become

1412.95 --> 1421.14
evil towards you and then the cycle

1414.87 --> 1423.3799999999999
never ends I'm very glad that I figured

1421.14 --> 1423.38
that out

1434.269 --> 1441.489
yeah anyway yeah

1444.279 --> 1450.139
there's so much going on it every time

1447.649 --> 1452.6589999999999
now that for example Owen Benjamin talks

1450.139 --> 1455.33
about subjects or Alex Jones talks about

1452.659 --> 1457.3690000000001
subjects or even flat earthers have a

1455.33 --> 1460.07
new subject sometimes it feels really

1457.369 --> 1462.379
difficult for me to just talk about it

1460.07 --> 1466.07
again now I don't know why that is

1462.379 --> 1473.089
it feels like that's not mine

1466.07 --> 1474.829
I just more and more I feel like I

1473.089 --> 1477.94
shouldn't even respond to things unless

1474.829 --> 1480.139
I have like a really personal

1477.94 --> 1484.749
contribution to add to it now I don't

1480.139 --> 1484.7489999999998
know what it is but I feel like I'm

1485.229 --> 1491.919
something is holding me back but it's

1489.139 --> 1491.9189999999999
not fair

1495.21 --> 1499.58
so I don't know maybe I should just be

1497.67 --> 1502.95
talking about my own issues and

1499.58 --> 1506.04
reflecting that story because I think

1502.95 --> 1508.92
that probably a lot of kids for example

1506.04 --> 1511.5
out there may be shocked to feel

1508.92 --> 1516.3300000000002
themselves resonating with it for

1511.5 --> 1519.72
example and then this is like a short

1516.33 --> 1521.37
glimpse of their own understanding of

1519.72 --> 1527.79
what's going on with them in the future

1521.37 --> 1530.1299999999999
and that might be encouraging that these

1527.79 --> 1532.59
things happen like that and it's very

1530.13 --> 1535.0200000000002
mysterious that it does it was very

1532.59 --> 1538.05
mysterious to me maybe your personal

1535.02 --> 1543.65
experience is slightly different or the

1538.05 --> 1548.22
different angle but this stuff happens

1543.65 --> 1552.6000000000001
and it shapes you when you're young the

1548.22 --> 1557.97
ways informations are are exposed to

1552.6 --> 1561.36
your innocent soul creates all these new

1557.97 --> 1566.7
worlds that sometimes completely replace

1561.36 --> 1569.9699999999998
the old mindset and feelings or they

1566.7 --> 1572.07
replace it partially and then instead

1569.97 --> 1576.14
cherish part of it or even hold it

1572.07 --> 1576.1399999999999
hostage it's weird other works

1578.25 --> 1589.049
this is a literal spirit development and

1584.669 --> 1593.73
it's fascinating and I'm sometimes I

1589.049 --> 1596.76
feel almost like gloating in just that I

1593.73 --> 1599.73
can actually talk about it in such

1596.76 --> 1603.179
detail with such confidence and I really

1599.73 --> 1603.78
know that I'm right about what I'm

1603.179 --> 1608.75
talking about

1603.78 --> 1608.75
at least when I'm talking about myself

1612.86 --> 1621.1499999999999
so yeah I hope it does make some kind of

1618.75 --> 1625.47
sense to some people out there at least

1621.15 --> 1629.01
my listeners and if it does you'll

1625.47 --> 1631.65
probably be reflecting now upon related

1629.01 --> 1635.58
or similar events in in your past

1631.65 --> 1638.73
because it's good to go over that to

1635.58 --> 1641.85
remember that sometimes like watching an

1638.73 --> 1644.82
old movie even if it was kind of

1641.85 --> 1648.99
terrible because sometimes much later it

1644.82 --> 1654.0
turns out to be terrible for reasons

1648.99 --> 1656.49
that have expired and then when you feel

1654.0 --> 1660.299
get close to that experience again when

1656.49 --> 1662.85
you let it get close to you then

1660.299 --> 1664.9189999999999
suddenly you'll see it in an entirely

1662.85 --> 1667.7099999999998
different way because there's a certain

1664.919 --> 1670.2
noise factor you could say that's not in

1667.71 --> 1674.28
the way anymore and you might be

1670.2 --> 1676.98
perplexed by what you're seeing which

1674.28 --> 1681.27
you will be totally different in some

1676.98 --> 1687.27
way no just self reflection is is it

1681.27 --> 1692.57
very important to in my opinion it fixed

1687.27 --> 1692.57
me without it I I probably be dead now

1693.169 --> 1697.6100000000001
probably would have been dead a long

1695.159 --> 1697.6100000000001
time ago

1698.179 --> 1709.7
it's also self-reflection is also the

1702.299 --> 1712.83
road to self forgiveness for example but

1709.7 --> 1718.259
yeah that only that's actually only

1712.83 --> 1719.97
really valid if it is true because you

1718.259 --> 1721.74
can't forgive yourself and just say oh

1719.97 --> 1723.659
yeah I forgive myself and just say no

1721.74 --> 1725.789
I'm not gonna feel bad anywhere I'm just

1723.659 --> 1727.5900000000001
not gonna indoctrinate myself about not

1725.789 --> 1731.519
feeling bad about something anymore

1727.59 --> 1734.22
but the problem is God the field of

1731.519 --> 1735.1490000000001
energy the resonance of everything does

1734.22 --> 1737.19
not agree with that

1735.149 --> 1738.84
you're sidestepping and other people

1737.19 --> 1741.419
will feel that and they will become

1738.84 --> 1744.0
agitated and they will have impulses to

1741.419 --> 1747.8890000000001
want to remind you about that but they

1744.0 --> 1750.389
might not do that for their own reasons

1747.889 --> 1752.519
so it's always important to when you

1750.389 --> 1758.07
approach something to try and forgive

1752.519 --> 1761.94
yourself that you will learn about the

1758.07 --> 1766.49
mistake that is the antecedent that is

1761.94 --> 1770.22
the necessity that is without that any

1766.49 --> 1774.419
forgiveness towards yourself is is just

1770.22 --> 1778.71
illusion forgiveness only is really

1774.419 --> 1782.519
valid when you fix it when you fix the

1778.71 --> 1785.22
thing somehow and if it is if it used to

1782.519 --> 1788.509
be something that like you damaged or

1785.22 --> 1792.929
you caused something that you can't fix

1788.509 --> 1796.769
that's yeah that's very difficult to

1792.929 --> 1798.3600000000001
reflect upon but then you can look at

1796.769 --> 1803.49
from different angles and just see like

1798.36 --> 1807.36
how the circumstances work and should

1803.49 --> 1809.3700000000001
you be taking full responsibility for

1807.36 --> 1812.4289999999999
something if you didn't have the full

1809.37 --> 1814.08
oversight and then how can you prevent

1812.429 --> 1816.509
it in the future from engaging in

1814.08 --> 1818.49
something potentially being able to

1816.509 --> 1820.98
cause things that you had no full

1818.49 --> 1822.75
oversight over so if you then learn the

1820.98 --> 1825.179
lesson by not allowing something to

1822.75 --> 1827.75
happen like that again by making sure

1825.179 --> 1832.0700000000002
you have the full oversight

1827.75 --> 1834.289
then any forgiveness can settle and then

1832.07 --> 1836.9289999999999
you probably will go to rest over time

1834.289 --> 1839.0
for it but if you're just gonna say like

1836.929 --> 1842.9
no I just couldn't help but you know I

1839.0 --> 1845.45
didn't know it doesn't matter then you

1842.9 --> 1850.8500000000001
can forgive yourself but it doesn't it's

1845.45 --> 1857.0
not valid doesn't really work because

1850.85 --> 1859.82
you haven't actually learned from the

1857.0 --> 1864.5
experience you haven't fixed what caused

1859.82 --> 1867.6399999999999
the mistake so I hope this is

1864.5 --> 1867.64
interesting to you guys

1875.89 --> 1881.5
all right and by the way this is not

1878.41 --> 1886.15
just all talk it is also something that

1881.5 --> 1888.04
I did because my parents did see me be

1886.15 --> 1889.8400000000001
led they were letting me do my own thing

1888.04 --> 1891.07
and it was kind of out of their hands

1889.84 --> 1893.83
because it was too much

1891.07 --> 1895.809
they couldn't wield me anyway after a

1893.83 --> 1897.37
while when I became a teenager and

1895.809 --> 1900.46
everything it was just too much for them

1897.37 --> 1901.87
I was too strong and we all knew it and

1900.46 --> 1903.91
I was sad about it

1901.87 --> 1905.799
I was disappointed that my poor parents

1903.91 --> 1908.74
weren't stronger basically because it's

1905.799 --> 1914.679
so much energy back then I was chaotic

1908.74 --> 1919.809
and unfound it properly yeah but now I

1914.679 --> 1922.2900000000002
completely lost my point too much at the

1919.809 --> 1922.29
same time

1930.33 --> 1934.6399999999999
and I completely lost the point

1945.83 --> 1961.84
Oh is there some update see let me

1958.999 --> 1961.84
distract myself

1978.97 --> 1987.55
I'm flattered wait oh yeah that's right

1983.62 --> 1989.2299999999998
I was kind of hoping that mind-warped

1987.55 --> 1995.74
would get on but he doesn't seem to be

1989.23 --> 1997.72
there oh wait he has responded oh he

1995.74 --> 2003.15
doesn't have any time now he said that

1997.72 --> 2006.0
he may join tomorrow huh oh well but

2003.15 --> 2008.46
yeah I'd hoped that because we had some

2006.0 --> 2011.85
progress on conversations about quantum

2008.46 --> 2017.91
mechanics and I'm gonna try to break in

2011.85 --> 2021.6299999999999
it break it open it it'll maybe become

2017.91 --> 2023.8200000000002
even a separate sub subject like Flat

2021.63 --> 2026.49
Earth because there is just so much

2023.82 --> 2030.36
about it that requires discussing and

2026.49 --> 2033.66
just just to elaborate what it is

2030.36 --> 2037.4399999999998
supposed to be and I got more people now

2033.66 --> 2039.96
that are saying to me yeah I really like

2037.44 --> 2042.5700000000002
what that you're doing this I find it

2039.96 --> 2045.83
interesting I have information so that

2042.57 --> 2048.69
means there is something coming together

2045.83 --> 2050.67
quantum mechanics that debates about

2048.69 --> 2056.19
that the debates about the micro world

2050.67 --> 2058.02
the the debates about the technology and

2056.19 --> 2060.06
I'm very enthusiastic about even now

2058.02 --> 2064.77
that I'm remembering it it's like oh

2060.06 --> 2067.23
yeah this is gonna get interesting so I

2064.77 --> 2075.69
hope that you will find that as

2067.23 --> 2079.14
interesting as I do what a plane will

2075.69 --> 2085.23
take off to fly around the world north

2079.14 --> 2091.6099999999997
and south livestreams okay that does

2085.23 --> 2091.61
sound interesting and hilarious

2094.57 --> 2101.1000000000004
where where can I find that Ragnar

2098.26 --> 2101.1000000000004
Stefan he'll listen

2111.05 --> 2117.67
ah thanks over Mukul let me check that

2115.49 --> 2117.6699999999996
out

2122.25 --> 2126.9
that's just 12 second video

2132.88 --> 2142.57
okay but it's not a livestream it's a 12

2135.52 --> 2151.86
second video so it says streamed live 12

2142.57 --> 2151.86
hours ago is that it 12 seconds

2154.65 --> 2162.079
that seems our

2168.5 --> 2173.15
it was the intro video right so it on

2171.41 --> 2175.7599999999998
this one more orbit

2173.15 --> 2177.71
alright that's a channel that is going

2175.76 --> 2182.75
to supposedly livestream it even though

2177.71 --> 2183.65
it's not announcing it yet anywhere okay

2182.75 --> 2190.31
sure

2183.65 --> 2194.859
I'll keep an eye on that and we'll see

2190.31 --> 2194.859
if it's worth subscribing before

2198.97 --> 2205.75
ah man

2201.3 --> 2205.75
[Music]

2212.609 --> 2220.72
right so it's gonna be that plane is it

2215.68 --> 2226.69
that small passenger wait what is it

2220.72 --> 2234.48
like a a private jet type plane that's

2226.69 --> 2234.48
gonna do it all right

2242.98 --> 2252.18
ah bilji creator sapien on it I don't

2249.55 --> 2252.1800000000003
think so

2266.16 --> 2273.99
all right well truth bliss Trish bliss

2269.19 --> 2275.82
I'm mostly curious how they're actually

2273.99 --> 2281.2999999999997
gonna film it is it gonna be freaking

2275.82 --> 2287.46
fish eye lens because if it is then I

2281.3 --> 2292.0800000000004
don't know it might be not all that easy

2287.46 --> 2295.23
to a peanuts clerk is calling then it

2292.08 --> 2305.84
might be not all that hard to basically

2295.23 --> 2305.84
fake that stuff or who knows maybe yeah

2307.1 --> 2313.0499999999997
maybe they figured out a way to trick it

2309.8 --> 2335.6400000000003
maybe they're slit anyway I'm gonna call

2313.05 --> 2339.6600000000003
in peanuts Clark he called me a good

2335.64 --> 2347.04
morning good morning man yeah doing good

2339.66 --> 2347.97
doing good okay yep yeah how are you

2347.04 --> 2360.33
doing

2347.97 --> 2362.22
you call hey hold on one second oh yeah

2360.33 --> 2364.29
right so they might have some kind of

2362.22 --> 2366.5099999999998
trick up their sleeve where they're

2364.29 --> 2368.88
basically gonna tap into the live stream

2366.51 --> 2371.5800000000004
do almost like a switcheroo thing like

2368.88 --> 2375.4500000000003
in the movies they do with the high-tech

2371.58 --> 2378.0299999999997
robbery like a vault robbery [ __ ] like

2375.45 --> 2380.04
put the camera on a loop at a certain

2378.03 --> 2382.9500000000003
point where that's really easy to do

2380.04 --> 2388.19
because it's just white beneath turn

2382.95 --> 2388.1899999999996
around and then continue the stream and

2389.48 --> 2394.04
well there would be some issues

2391.68 --> 2397.0699999999997
concerning the angle of the light

2394.04 --> 2399.5
and that might be the only clue that you

2397.07 --> 2401.2400000000002
actually get that they did turn because

2399.5 --> 2407.93
the angle of the Sun and everything is

2401.24 --> 2409.49
gonna be different so yeah there's this

2407.93 --> 2411.5299999999997
of course a lot to speculate about

2409.49 --> 2415.16
what's gonna happen but who knows maybe

2411.53 --> 2418.34
just gonna go to north and uh their

2415.16 --> 2424.7599999999998
connection was broken because there were

2418.34 --> 2428.51
no satellites or blah and then maybe

2424.76 --> 2430.07
it's gonna be even cheaper at it then

2428.51 --> 2432.92
what I suggested they're just gonna

2430.07 --> 2437.0800000000004
there's there enough yeah but it was

2432.92 --> 2437.08
still life it was just technical issues

2437.17 --> 2446.7200000000003
so it's taking peanuts Clark so long

2441.59 --> 2449.21
you're still there yeah I was waiting

2446.72 --> 2455.06
for you to talk how you been man yeah

2449.21 --> 2459.56
I'm doing good yeah you're talking about

2455.06 --> 2463.7599999999998
you're talking about people used to

2459.56 --> 2467.48
think that your attorney now now look I

2463.76 --> 2470.3900000000003
am partially Chinese and that kind of

2467.48 --> 2472.04
impressed me like I was just a little

2470.39 --> 2474.6189999999997
kid you know so I was like Oh Chinese

2472.04 --> 2476.0
and then all their culture and I thought

2474.619 --> 2478.52
it was kind of interesting and

2476.0 --> 2484.1
fascinating and the different music and

2478.52 --> 2486.59
[ __ ] and I don't know the kids in my

2484.1 --> 2489.109
school they kind of bullied me with that

2486.59 --> 2493.57
at some point but seriously they bullied

2489.109 --> 2497.63
me with everything they could find

2493.57 --> 2499.1600000000003
because I just baited everything I would

2497.63 --> 2500.6600000000003
tell them [ __ ] about myself that I

2499.16 --> 2504.56
shouldn't and then they would then

2500.66 --> 2505.81
proceeded to bully me with that story of

2504.56 --> 2509.0299999999997
my life

2505.81 --> 2511.07
right that's not this I thought the only

2509.03 --> 2515.6600000000003
parts that you remember huh are there

2511.07 --> 2519.3500000000004
some good parts that you remember oh I

2515.66 --> 2522.23
remember that they would go out and do

2519.35 --> 2524.93
sneaky stuff that you're not allowed to

2522.23 --> 2525.83
do and then then they would welcome me

2524.93 --> 2528.41
with them

2525.83 --> 2531.65
because I'm actually kind of competent

2528.41 --> 2536.72
and they would much easier chicken out

2531.65 --> 2538.37
than I would with things so yeah I was

2536.72 --> 2541.9599999999996
kind of a naughty kid I did some pretty

2538.37 --> 2545.62
crazy things also like stupid things

2541.96 --> 2556.51
didn't actually get anyone really hurt

2545.62 --> 2561.47
but did just stupid things so uh how was

2556.51 --> 2563.2900000000004
the flutter drama or community or

2561.47 --> 2565.64
movement whatever you want to call it

2563.29 --> 2574.85
hmm I've kind of taken a step I've kind

2565.64 --> 2579.17
of taken a step back yeah why it was

2574.85 --> 2585.08
just consuming me and my family was

2579.17 --> 2589.4900000000002
taking a notice and mm-hmm it was it was

2585.08 --> 2591.5299999999997
consuming me a lot and I don't know if

2589.49 --> 2595.4599999999996
you you remember last few times we

2591.53 --> 2597.44
talked mm-hmm I didn't I didn't know

2595.46 --> 2599.93
what to do with this information you

2597.44 --> 2603.53
know because it just I was happy before

2599.93 --> 2609.14
I found slaughter you know all right

2603.53 --> 2611.51
yeah and in a way I almost want it back

2609.14 --> 2614.9
but I don't want to go back to sleep

2611.51 --> 2616.82
you know and it's you could never be

2614.9 --> 2620.06
among these people and tolerate their

2616.82 --> 2621.8
behavior again you know before you

2620.06 --> 2623.5099999999998
thought they were really fighting on the

2621.8 --> 2626.21
right side and they were just panicking

2623.51 --> 2628.07
now you know you can never unknow that

2626.21 --> 2633.89
even if you're gonna act it so it's

2628.07 --> 2638.1400000000003
never gonna be the same anyway there

2633.89 --> 2638.14
will always be glowers dear

2638.23 --> 2650.5
and I I keep wondering you know because

2644.32 --> 2653.349
I watched Nathan show a lot and Nathan

2650.5 --> 2657.88
always stressed that you know we don't

2653.349 --> 2661.57
live on a model and anytime a model was

2657.88 --> 2666.2200000000003
presented anytime a model was brought up

2661.57 --> 2667.75
it was quickly thrown out yeah

2666.22 --> 2673.1499999999996
and then one day I one day I'm watching

2667.75 --> 2676.359
the show and Nathan and Dawn present a

2673.15 --> 2679.589
model and I can't tell if they're

2676.359 --> 2686.3489999999997
trolling the globus or they're serious

2679.589 --> 2688.3289999999997
it's throwing me off I mean what were

2686.349 --> 2690.19
they serious about that providing the

2688.329 --> 2690.9300000000003
the globe arts model has a flatter as

2690.19 --> 2694.39
well

2690.93 --> 2698.0789999999997
you remember that the globe earth model

2694.39 --> 2701.97
as a Flat Earth Map do you remember the

2698.079 --> 2708.369
show where they presented they presented

2701.97 --> 2710.56
elevation on the Google Earth right it

2708.369 --> 2714.19
pulled Google look Google Earth up and

2710.56 --> 2718.75
they provided an example of elevation in

2714.19 --> 2720.4900000000002
one spot elevation in another across a

2718.75 --> 2727.3
bridge I think it was do you not

2720.49 --> 2730.4199999999996
remember yeah but I am what is the exact

2727.3 --> 2733.2400000000002
issue here constantly so doing a lot of

2730.42 --> 2736.9300000000003
dates for this year were they serious or

2733.24 --> 2739.45
was that them trolling I don't know it's

2736.93 --> 2742.75
probably them trolling if they even

2739.45 --> 2745.1699999999996
remember that so because I've noticed

2742.75 --> 2751.54
they haven't brought it back up reading

2745.17 --> 2755.02
okay I'm basically ignoring that yeah I

2751.54 --> 2759.79
just thought that was weird but and also

2755.02 --> 2761.47
like I didn't want to ask flat earthers

2759.79 --> 2764.46
and I really respect you and I don't

2761.47 --> 2768.2999999999997
want to put you in a position but I mean

2764.46 --> 2770.46
how how many miles is it to the edge I

2768.3 --> 2774.4900000000002
was says there's a net

2770.46 --> 2775.63
well I mean you claim that it's flat

2774.49 --> 2779.77
right

2775.63 --> 2784.02
it seems so yeah so there there has to

2779.77 --> 2787.45
be an end point or there has to be a

2784.02 --> 2793.45
part where like you would say looping

2787.45 --> 2796.96
mm-hmm so that's my question

2793.45 --> 2802.0299999999997
and so your question is how wide is the

2796.96 --> 2803.89
loop please nobody's a loop right well

2802.03 --> 2805.9
we're I can say pretty much that it's

2803.89 --> 2810.04
gonna be the entire known length of the

2805.9 --> 2814.359
equator at least at that point and it

2810.04 --> 2816.7
might be smaller the closer you get to

2814.359 --> 2818.35
the you further you go north north or

2816.7 --> 2822.0
south from that I don't know for sure

2818.35 --> 2825.52
how that works really if it's looping

2822.0 --> 2828.25
it's not guaranteed to be literally

2825.52 --> 2833.83
rectangular with straight connections it

2828.25 --> 2839.92
might be warped looping like yeah like

2833.83 --> 2844.0299999999997
beads connected where the presupposed

2839.92 --> 2846.9700000000003
Antarctica and or Pole north pole that

2844.03 --> 2849.28
those regions would be when the loop

2846.97 --> 2852.8799999999997
would be tighter which is extremely

2849.28 --> 2855.6090000000004
confusing because that would heavily

2852.88 --> 2859.81
suggest that it would be a lateral globe

2855.609 --> 2861.4
shape to those that are trying to go

2859.81 --> 2862.66
around in that region because it's

2861.4 --> 2866.14
literally getting tighter

2862.66 --> 2868.0
that's so weird if you go from east to

2866.14 --> 2870.67
west and straight line then it will

2868.0 --> 2873.04
become shorter before you fall back into

2870.67 --> 2876.25
your own footsteps basically but the

2873.04 --> 2880.359
only real way to prove that it would be

2876.25 --> 2883.859
like that is to find the end point in

2880.359 --> 2886.99
the north find a barrier or a literal

2883.859 --> 2889.2999999999997
middle point whatever it's gonna be and

2886.99 --> 2892.4199999999996
if there's not gonna be a barrier then

2889.3 --> 2895.96
that loop may simply widen again it's

2892.42 --> 2897.76
like literally you walk onto what seems

2895.96 --> 2899.53
to be like a globe but when you get to

2897.76 --> 2903.8500000000004
the middle there's like a tunnel into

2899.53 --> 2907.03
like a new realm beyond that

2903.85 --> 2908.41
and the South could be the same anyway

2907.03 --> 2911.8300000000004
this might be a little bit too

2908.41 --> 2917.1099999999997
complicated now it's just I'm falling

2911.83 --> 2920.41
I'm following alright so I'm not I'm not

2917.11 --> 2923.44
picking on this person but someone in

2920.41 --> 2924.0099999999998
track says we don't know what the shape

2923.44 --> 2927.34
is

2924.01 --> 2931.3300000000004
so therefore are you willing to concede

2927.34 --> 2935.59
that maybe we shouldn't tell people that

2931.33 --> 2938.41
it's far well flat is not a shape flat

2935.59 --> 2941.6800000000003
is a geometrical aspect that is very

2938.41 --> 2944.2799999999997
deduce ibly so so I'm not gonna say the

2941.68 --> 2947.02
earth is not flat because I haven't seen

2944.28 --> 2951.0600000000004
anything did that to contradict that

2947.02 --> 2960.31
aspect about it but flat is not a shape

2951.06 --> 2963.04
globe is a shape I mean for one right we

2960.31 --> 2967.45
can't go high enough to go up there and

2963.04 --> 2971.5299999999997
take a picture right we can't explore

2967.45 --> 2974.2599999999998
right because none of us have obviously

2971.53 --> 2978.4300000000003
the funds or the resources to be able to

2974.26 --> 2984.07
do that and I'm just kind of taking a

2978.43 --> 2986.7999999999997
step back because how can I tell someone

2984.07 --> 2989.05
that the earth is flat when I surely

2986.8 --> 2992.77
don't know I don't know what the shape

2989.05 --> 2996.07
is and in it well you have to start

2992.77 --> 2998.83
somewhere it is no use going to people

2996.07 --> 3000.69
like oh my god you have to listen I

2998.83 --> 3002.94
don't know what the shape of the earth

3000.69 --> 3005.37
is really that's the honest truth

3002.94 --> 3007.35
you think they're gonna think oh my god

3005.37 --> 3009.98
this guy is on to something no he's

3007.35 --> 3012.06
gonna say that guys just literally

3009.98 --> 3013.77
cognitive dissonance some piece of

3012.06 --> 3016.59
information that they take for granted

3013.77 --> 3018.42
out of existence though they're never

3016.59 --> 3023.6400000000003
gonna respond to that no you have to

3018.42 --> 3026.82
present an alternative to the input that

3023.64 --> 3030.21
has ties in that has work that is

3026.82 --> 3031.92
inviting the consciousness into that

3030.21 --> 3033.75
like there is something to it there has

3031.92 --> 3037.28
to be something to work with to figure

3033.75 --> 3040.58
out can't just say yeah

3037.28 --> 3043.7000000000003
in true reality we don't know that might

3040.58 --> 3045.88
be a good position to bring up in a more

3043.7 --> 3048.8599999999997
advanced philosophical debate maybe

3045.88 --> 3051.5
right but when you're just talking to

3048.86 --> 3053.15
the common people they're literally for

3051.5 --> 3067.28
good reasons gonna think you're just

3053.15 --> 3070.25
crazy even though you may be right hold

3067.28 --> 3073.7000000000003
on yeah eternal incites a also yeah you

3070.25 --> 3075.86
you can't say I don't know but it's not

3073.7 --> 3079.6699999999996
a globe yeah you could do that it's not

3075.86 --> 3083.03
a globe but it is almost the same effect

3079.67 --> 3085.25
it's just like no it's not this look you

3083.03 --> 3088.1600000000003
have to see what else is out there in

3085.25 --> 3089.96
the world okay and this is the bad part

3088.16 --> 3092.81
about the whole setup

3089.96 --> 3095.18
it's very polluting and that is that

3092.81 --> 3099.47
there's other groups out there that are

3095.18 --> 3103.27
kind of doing that by saying there's no

3099.47 --> 3106.81
gender okay and because that is

3103.27 --> 3109.19
everywhere the common people will see a

3106.81 --> 3113.36
person a flat earther that being on say

3109.19 --> 3116.68
now I it's not a globe will interpret

3113.36 --> 3119.9300000000003
that as being on the same spectrum as

3116.68 --> 3120.44
there is no gender and other things like

3119.93 --> 3124.04
that

3120.44 --> 3127.94
that they will think it is and another

3124.04 --> 3130.88
piece of that vast attempt from the dark

3127.94 --> 3136.07
side to derail society that is a big

3130.88 --> 3138.9500000000003
problem for us all so it's not a perfect

3136.07 --> 3142.3300000000004
solution it's better technically to just

3138.95 --> 3145.6699999999996
hand something alternative to work with

3142.33 --> 3147.44
because the people that yeah they want

3145.67 --> 3149.69
to work with something they it's like a

3147.44 --> 3151.58
new hobby and then they might figure it

3149.69 --> 3153.86
out and then eventually come to the

3151.58 --> 3155.99
realization oh [ __ ] yeah it is actually

3153.86 --> 3158.78
a toy to get you out of the globe

3155.99 --> 3161.93
because in reality we don't know and

3158.78 --> 3165.4700000000003
that's the big problem but you can't

3161.93 --> 3168.35
start out with that in my opinion that's

3165.47 --> 3170.72
not wise well let me let me ask you if

3168.35 --> 3174.89
and you know why do you think

3170.72 --> 3177.5299999999997
that the question of how many miles is

3174.89 --> 3181.79
it to the edge why is that not the

3177.53 --> 3183.8900000000003
biggest question in this conversation

3181.79 --> 3186.23
because it's the biggest straw man

3183.89 --> 3188.72
question because it is automatically

3186.23 --> 3191.33
assuming that the earth is a shape of

3188.72 --> 3193.3399999999997
some kind in the middle of space and if

3191.33 --> 3195.59
you say flat then he automatically

3193.34 --> 3196.9700000000003
flatten the first thing that comes to

3195.59 --> 3198.9500000000003
mind which would be a globe and then

3196.97 --> 3203.5699999999997
it's a disk and then it has an edge so

3198.95 --> 3206.56
that's why that question comes up it's

3203.57 --> 3209.3
still angled from globe thinking

3206.56 --> 3214.0
accepting outer space surrounding the

3209.3 --> 3214.0
earth that's why they asked for the edge

3215.71 --> 3224.89
what wouldn't possibly finding that that

3221.96 --> 3228.859
question out wouldn't that kind of

3224.89 --> 3234.71
wouldn't that solve it on both in what

3228.859 --> 3240.56
do you mean here so I mean if if we if a

3234.71 --> 3243.109
group did explore and did go out and did

3240.56 --> 3244.97
come up to some type of barrier wouldn't

3243.109 --> 3249.17
wouldn't that do it right there I mean

3244.97 --> 3251.2999999999997
wouldn't that kill the globe maybe or it

3249.17 --> 3253.25
would spring forth new globe theories

3251.3 --> 3255.05
where would be said oh my god there

3253.25 --> 3258.44
seems to be some kind of protection dome

3255.05 --> 3262.3
around our ball planets to protect us

3258.44 --> 3267.5
from the aliens outside or you know

3262.3 --> 3269.0800000000004
they'll never give it up they don't need

3267.5 --> 3272.349
to they can just change everything

3269.08 --> 3276.77
except that the earth must be a globe

3272.349 --> 3279.5
they can do that you know other people

3276.77 --> 3282.23
have even attempted like put back in the

3279.5 --> 3287.349
Creator even but still keep the earth

3282.23 --> 3287.349
globe can't open did it

3288.51 --> 3294.2690000000002
for example do you oh man he's into you

3292.589 --> 3297.069
yeah

3294.269 --> 3300.279
nice listen I can't hold him but I I

3297.069 --> 3303.91
don't know I don't really I don't really

3300.279 --> 3306.88
resonate with what he says I used to

3303.91 --> 3310.1499999999996
he basically helped taught me a lot

3306.88 --> 3311.6800000000003
about evolution and how the Smithsonian

3310.15 --> 3318.1600000000003
is screwing around and even the first

3311.68 --> 3325.1189999999997
hints of giants and yeah but that was

3318.16 --> 3326.71
now 10 years ago no I know you said you

3325.119 --> 3334.21
were listening the whole engagement did

3326.71 --> 3335.98
you catch Jose show yesterday yeah did

3334.21 --> 3337.96
you did you listen to the 911

3335.98 --> 3339.609
conversation they had yep

3337.96 --> 3344.109
the big big chunk of it it was

3339.609 --> 3347.2599999999998
interesting good like could you just

3344.109 --> 3349.359
like hear that just honestly and some of

3347.26 --> 3352.349
those guys how they were literally

3349.359 --> 3355.48
trying to petition for a job with CNN

3352.349 --> 3358.75
that's house that's how sycophantic they

3355.48 --> 3360.819
got about it yeah absolutely it was I

3358.75 --> 3365.619
really think these guys want a fricking

3360.819 --> 3366.099
job with CNN there that might was pretty

3365.619 --> 3370.329
bad

3366.099 --> 3376.6600000000003
I was listening at work and I was like

3370.329 --> 3378.13
these little lying POS the evidence is

3376.66 --> 3380.46
right there in your face and they're

3378.13 --> 3383.9500000000003
like no you know nothing wrong with that

3380.46 --> 3388.7200000000003
Wow I got the armor off the government

3383.95 --> 3392.2
on me it's like you know I understand a

3388.72 --> 3395.069
lot of people flat earth is just

3392.2 --> 3398.74
something that they may not be able to

3395.069 --> 3404.079
reconcile but 9/11 man you got to give

3398.74 --> 3407.2
us that that's totally obvious and it

3404.079 --> 3410.5
was it blew my mind how disingenuous

3407.2 --> 3413.99
they were being especially that big blue

3410.5 --> 3418.47
guy like wow

3413.99 --> 3420.4399999999996
how dishonest can you be yeah wait

3418.47 --> 3423.8999999999996
big blue guy which one was that

3420.44 --> 3426.48
submarine man that's his name no the

3423.9 --> 3432.81
dude with the gorilla Oh God gorilla uh

3426.48 --> 3442.26
yeah mr. cowboy space cowboy yeah god

3432.81 --> 3445.73
what a caricature is that like that's

3442.26 --> 3448.6200000000003
all that's all I really I would prefer

3445.73 --> 3452.9
Kevin people around me to you wouldn't

3448.62 --> 3461.7
trust a gorilla with a cowboy accent

3452.9 --> 3465.51
right yeah like I would rather you know

3461.7 --> 3470.0699999999997
give all around me to look into 9/11 and

3465.51 --> 3473.61
be honest about it then to admit that

3470.07 --> 3475.1400000000003
the earth is not a closed right because

3473.61 --> 3479.04
at least that shows that you're willing

3475.14 --> 3483.29
to you're willing to accept that yes

3479.04 --> 3485.61
your authority does lie to you and

3483.29 --> 3488.85
that's all that's all I really ever

3485.61 --> 3493.29
wanted yeah well for me even saying it's

3488.85 --> 3495.24
not a globe is technically not a hundred

3493.29 --> 3497.85
percent certain yet because the world

3495.24 --> 3501.0899999999997
may be incredibly surreal and warped in

3497.85 --> 3504.24
spaciality as looping wood or like it's

3501.09 --> 3506.67
once it could be looping you're opening

3504.24 --> 3508.62
up the door for a very warped

3506.67 --> 3511.35
potentially warped reality that could

3508.62 --> 3515.37
literally look the looping aspect could

3511.35 --> 3518.91
be like a next test like okay is your

3515.37 --> 3521.52
mind ready to accept that then if you go

3518.91 --> 3524.7599999999998
looking further you may end up being

3521.52 --> 3528.12
confronted with freaking looping mirror

3524.76 --> 3533.7000000000003
whole [ __ ] so you know you don't know

3528.12 --> 3535.62
God is a very very broad creator at it

3533.7 --> 3538.02
including the surreal elements I think

3535.62 --> 3540.47
so far so who knows what it could turn

3538.02 --> 3540.47
out to be

3540.49 --> 3548.29
so uh in your in your chat why better

3543.91 --> 3550.72
says so it's okay to accept the amount

3548.29 --> 3553.869
eleven thing because of your proof but

3550.72 --> 3558.5099999999998
it's not okay to accept photos of Earth

3553.869 --> 3561.1600000000003
from space and then he says the irony

3558.51 --> 3567.88
exact Lange for you because of your men

3561.16 --> 3571.2999999999997
I don't get that well we were talking

3567.88 --> 3573.79
about 9/11 and how I would rather I

3571.3 --> 3580.0
would rather someone admit 9/11 to me

3573.79 --> 3581.68
than the earth not being a globe he's

3580.0 --> 3584.08
comparing two different things I mean

3581.68 --> 3587.3799999999997
all right oh I get it

3584.08 --> 3589.63
yeah I get it now it took it took a very

3587.38 --> 3592.9300000000003
long time but I get it right so yet

3589.63 --> 3595.9
because 9/11 is so blatantly obvious you

3592.93 --> 3598.2999999999997
don't yeah it's not that difficult to

3595.9 --> 3600.76
get over as the globe because the globe

3598.3 --> 3604.29
is just Tinker Tailor designed to stick

3600.76 --> 3607.1090000000004
to the mind like a curse it's the balls

3604.29 --> 3611.89
especially the men they just want balls

3607.109 --> 3615.2799999999997
balls on women balls for kicking they

3611.89 --> 3618.339
like balls so if you're gonna take a

3615.28 --> 3619.7200000000003
ball away one one way or the other are

3618.339 --> 3620.83
you gonna take away their games are you

3619.72 --> 3622.359
gonna take away their boobs they're

3620.83 --> 3623.83
gonna get pissed off so if you're gonna

3622.359 --> 3626.589
take away their earth globe they're

3623.83 --> 3628.77
gonna be pissed off as well so that's my

3626.589 --> 3632.5499999999997
over-generalized theory about that

3628.77 --> 3632.55
concerning psychology

3636.4 --> 3643.339
women at some it's crazy I wonder if you

3640.94 --> 3647.119
could do a statistical analysis about

3643.339 --> 3648.65
that and it's this is totally ridiculous

3647.119 --> 3651.8900000000003
by the way what I'm gonna propose now

3648.65 --> 3655.13
but just think like okay do tests on men

3651.89 --> 3657.77
and then basically analyze if they like

3655.13 --> 3660.94
boobs if they think that's important or

3657.77 --> 3664.28
they really enjoy that and then ask him

3660.94 --> 3666.619
what do you think about people that say

3664.28 --> 3668.9900000000002
the earth is not a globe and just see

3666.619 --> 3671.54
how intense if there is a direct

3668.99 --> 3673.9399999999996
correlation between the two that may

3671.54 --> 3678.619
prove or statistically proof of

3673.94 --> 3682.339
correlation for my theory see what you

3678.619 --> 3688.67
mean I wonder you know it seems to be

3682.339 --> 3690.5299999999997
very psychological oriented so I'm

3688.67 --> 3697.76
joking about it but it may actually be

3690.53 --> 3699.1400000000003
real like I said man I am I've just been

3697.76 --> 3701.809
sitting back I've been watching

3699.14 --> 3704.95
everybody I watch a lot of the shows of

3701.809 --> 3707.5690000000004
course I have a job to where I could put

3704.95 --> 3713.3289999999997
the Bluetooth headphones in and just

3707.569 --> 3717.41
kind of listen a lot work and just been

3713.329 --> 3720.26
I don't know it's just weird it's no one

3717.41 --> 3722.6299999999997
no one talks about the edge no one wants

3720.26 --> 3725.15
to talk about it and to me that's the

3722.63 --> 3731.27
most important question how many miles

3725.15 --> 3734.48
is it to the edge well there's only one

3731.27 --> 3737.299
way to find out if there is any distance

3734.48 --> 3740.359
to an edge by confirming that there is

3737.299 --> 3743.569
an edge and what that would entail if

3740.359 --> 3747.74
it's an edge to this to the room you can

3743.569 --> 3752.45
go or if it is an edge of the earth in

3747.74 --> 3755.359
some wider weird container you know who

3752.45 --> 3757.9399999999996
knows maybe the earth is actually like a

3755.359 --> 3760.64
pyramid stepping-stone and we're just on

3757.94 --> 3763.7000000000003
the top stone

3760.64 --> 3767.8399999999997
maybe it's a turtle on the back of a

3763.7 --> 3769.85
turtle maybe it is like geometrically

3767.84 --> 3773.4700000000003
specially turtle shape even though

3769.85 --> 3775.94
everything would literally be flat

3773.47 --> 3780.62
that's the weird thing about it it could

3775.94 --> 3784.13
be any shape if you however you put all

3780.62 --> 3786.77
the land together it will all be flat

3784.13 --> 3788.7200000000003
but it could be any weird threat the

3786.77 --> 3793.13
line shape potentially maybe it is like

3788.72 --> 3800.3599999999997
a weird geometrical turtle shape in some

3793.13 --> 3803.27
bizarre way who knows oh it's good

3800.36 --> 3805.76
talking to you man I hope you're doing

3803.27 --> 3806.0
well I know you probably want to round

3805.76 --> 3810.07
down

3806.0 --> 3812.78
I am yeah yeah I have to go to work and

3810.07 --> 3819.11
I'm glad you're doing good man you seem

3812.78 --> 3821.3300000000004
like you're up well it is it is because

3819.11 --> 3823.4300000000003
it is the day of the moment though right

3821.33 --> 3825.98
the moment of the day because my show

3823.43 --> 3827.48

CGI ranting yeah I'm seeing CGI ranty a

3875.06 --> 3881.2999999999997
lot in my jet it's so funny because we

3878.87 --> 3883.16
all thought like he was a genuinely

3881.3 --> 3891.4100000000003
annoying troll but he turns out to be

3883.16 --> 3893.48
pretty ok is is mr. Cheswick is that is

3891.41 --> 3897.71
that Baldy cat does that the same

3893.48 --> 3899.03
the person one where I'm not not in your

3897.71 --> 3903.71
chat I'm talking about in general

3899.03 --> 3905.42

3903.71 --> 3908.45
conspiracy cats and Baltic that's the

3905.42 --> 3909.109
same person yes I'm pretty sure they are

3908.45 --> 3914.8399999999997
the same

3909.109 --> 3916.52
I think they seem to be the same but

3914.84 --> 3918.77
yeah I'm not the one to ask I'm not

3916.52 --> 3922.73
really the one to keep track of like

3918.77 --> 3931.55
what's going on in in account world of

3922.73 --> 3933.68
YouTube to address Brenda honestly I

3931.55 --> 3936.5600000000004
I've taken a step back I know and I

3933.68 --> 3942.7999999999997
don't know because I don't know how many

3936.56 --> 3944.96
miles to the edge I don't I'm just

3942.8 --> 3947.42
curiously waiting for that one moment

3944.96 --> 3950.63
where finally a giant laser will be

3947.42 --> 3955.07
tested firing perpendicular to the

3950.63 --> 3959.96
equator and then watching live on camera

3955.07 --> 3968.4500000000003
as the laser past fires past itself I'm

3959.96 --> 3973.43
really waiting for it I hope well

3968.45 --> 3978.35
shouldn't be too difficult doesn't have

3973.43 --> 3980.39
to be a Death Star laser or anything it

3978.35 --> 3984.85
would just have to be very strong and

3980.39 --> 3984.85
stable and straight

3988.099 --> 3996.63
