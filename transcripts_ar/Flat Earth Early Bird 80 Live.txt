3.92 --> 11.309000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.89 --> 20.09
early-bird number 80 I'm your host

11.309 --> 24.14
Arwen and what a raucous entire day

20.09 --> 28.16
started pretty much yesterday and weird

24.14 --> 32.099000000000004
weird responses from the world very

28.16 --> 35.3
fascinating responses and I'm talking in

32.099 --> 35.3
ethereal says

39.8 --> 45.879999999999995
for whatever it's worth I think that

46.27 --> 55.940000000000005
yesterday in one of the first analysis

50.02 --> 60.800000000000004
on this site is inside that I shared it

55.94 --> 63.01
was probably a mistake even to bring

60.8 --> 63.01
that up

64.17 --> 71.72
the whole thing about Trump and Hillary

68.34 --> 71.72
being the same

73.259 --> 82.259
it wasn't exactly what I was saying just

76.049 --> 84.42
that seem to be intertwined very much

82.259 --> 87.2
they're not the same they are very much

84.42 --> 87.2
not the same

91.82 --> 95.32
so let that be clear

96.49 --> 106.14999999999999
I'm not moving to that side

100.18 --> 110.97900000000001
never will I yeah I I want balance I

106.15 --> 113.4
want peace but only peace that make

110.979 --> 113.4
sense

114.729 --> 126.729
not a stalemate that all definitely end

118.27 --> 129.869
up in a loss in losing the war the

126.729 --> 129.869
spiritual battle and

137.55 --> 142.58
I don't really know what to say it's

140.34 --> 142.58
like

146.22 --> 154.71
I do support Trump and I do support what

150.81 --> 156.81
he has done mostly in but yeah the

154.71 --> 159.15
doubts all the doubts and what is he

156.81 --> 161.63
doing and is this right and why is he

159.15 --> 161.63
doing it

161.69 --> 171.57
is he being blackmailed in a very dirty

167.07 --> 174.47
way that he doesn't know how to work

171.57 --> 174.47
around for example

180.08 --> 185.45000000000002
that they find his ultimate weak spot

182.78 --> 188.75
and exploit it and they're holding him

185.45 --> 191.06
hostage with it and it doesn't even need

188.75 --> 193.61
to be a dark thing about him I don't

191.06 --> 199.54
think they did I really don't think he

193.61 --> 205.15
has that type of darkness with him

199.54 --> 205.15
corruptibility now he is too much

205.18 --> 212.63
dedicated to his methods he is walking

209.39 --> 216.35
his path so straight in his own way it's

212.63 --> 219.47
just everybody's path is always

216.35 --> 222.62
different than what everybody thinks it

219.47 --> 225.83
should be when you actually start to

222.62 --> 229.22
walk it and in that sense everybody is

225.83 --> 231.44000000000003
now like I get the feeling I don't know

229.22 --> 233.0
if that's just me projecting but I get

231.44 --> 234.59
this feeling like everybody's trying to

233.0 --> 237.77
tell me no you're doing it wrong you

234.59 --> 240.08
doing this you doing that it's the same

237.77 --> 245.69
thing in another way you know from

240.08 --> 249.61
another angle if you walk the path then

245.69 --> 249.60999999999999
the world will turn against you

254.55 --> 260.34000000000003
from within from within the darkness the

257.01 --> 264.32
darkness will oppose you and yeah how do

260.34 --> 264.32
you deal with that and what can you do

267.97 --> 271.98
is there a thing like about

272.62 --> 278.84000000000003
spiritual sacrifice like choices you

276.44 --> 282.59
have to make this kind of thing what is

278.84 --> 284.98999999999995
that how does that work because yeah the

282.59 --> 287.45
darkness will always resort to any kind

284.99 --> 292.66
of power blackmail of course

287.45 --> 295.9
any way they can find it any method I

292.66 --> 298.70000000000005
think they have become that ruthless or

295.9 --> 301.34
just don't care and that ruthlessness

298.7 --> 306.4
expresses itself automatically through

301.34 --> 308.98999999999995
them it's a side effect of corruption

306.4 --> 311.289
once you corrupt

308.99 --> 314.84000000000003
there's no limit to the fall really

311.289 --> 316.639
that's the danger and if you wouldn't

314.84 --> 320.349
want to uncorrupt then you have to atone

316.639 --> 324.979
and that brings another sacrifice

320.349 --> 328.699
usually the sacrifice that was required

324.979 --> 331.479
by God that was refused in order to turn

328.699 --> 331.479
to the darkness

334.389 --> 337.389
it's

338.17 --> 346.96000000000004
it's very complicated and it's very

340.93 --> 349.12
personal and nobody can really judge for

346.96 --> 359.95
each person's choice they can only

349.12 --> 365.11
respond to the choice anyway so yeah I

359.95 --> 368.95
kind of yesterday was like a day when I

365.11 --> 371.17
was at the beginning very much I felt

368.95 --> 373.47999999999996
everything pressing on me so badly and

371.17 --> 377.53000000000003
there was kind of almost trying to look

373.48 --> 379.75
for a way to escape like I feeling like

377.53 --> 381.88
I'm faltering I can't handle this [ __ ]

379.75 --> 383.56
you know is this really what I'm

381.88 --> 388.65999999999997
supposed to be doing and I asked that

383.56 --> 392.95
question every so often and this time I

388.66 --> 394.48
was strong and then the Hangout

392.95 --> 399.61
yesterday happened and the way it

394.48 --> 402.76
started and other responses as well from

399.61 --> 407.37
before that hangout just like very

402.76 --> 407.37
snappy very icy out of nowhere

409.73 --> 418.19
but they seem to come from the light and

412.82 --> 420.44
not from the dark as I was faltering I

418.19 --> 425.03
guess almost like the light reaching out

420.44 --> 426.85
like oh stay in line stay in line don't

425.03 --> 431.15
get confused don't get distracted

426.85 --> 433.31
through other people that barely know me

431.15 --> 436.03999999999996
but in that moment suddenly out of

433.31 --> 439.19
nothing they seemed to know me so

436.04 --> 441.71000000000004
fascinating to see it's the same kind of

439.19 --> 445.51
responses as what the darkness does it

441.71 --> 452.63
comes out of people that are just dumb

445.51 --> 456.65
but then all this condensed well thought

452.63 --> 459.35
out reasoning not really from the person

456.65 --> 463.57
themselves comes out so the darkness has

459.35 --> 463.57000000000005
this and the light has this

464.77 --> 473.46999999999997
and yeah so I want to do a step forward

469.569 --> 477.91
again and basically say no I have to do

473.47 --> 482.94000000000005
this and even though it'll again up the

477.91 --> 482.94
pressure I must try to take this

487.71 --> 496.46
and let the world transform towards the

491.85 --> 498.6
light and there's probably gonna be

496.46 --> 503.12
sacrifices one way or the other it's

498.6 --> 503.12
just there's no way around it

510.55 --> 516.909
so whatever's gonna happen it's gonna

512.62 --> 521.05
suck but it's better to have something

516.909 --> 524.83
that sucks with some kind of Hope than

521.05 --> 528.39
to just not think about it and let

524.83 --> 528.39
darkness overcome everything

541.68 --> 546.3199999999999
there's many subjects that kind of

543.54 --> 556.04
wanted to touch upon but I don't know

546.32 --> 561.3900000000001
it's time yet [ __ ] about my past like

556.04 --> 563.01
growing up in a liberal family the weird

561.39 --> 565.29
thing is is that from that perspective

563.01 --> 567.5699999999999
everything seems normal but in

565.29 --> 571.4699999999999
retrospect when you look back at the

567.57 --> 578.279
certain things that transpired then

571.47 --> 583.5600000000001
start to get questions like like was

578.279 --> 588.06
this wrong what happened but I just took

583.56 --> 591.4499999999999
it with energy like I like rededicated

588.06 --> 593.2199999999999
to love basically in the face of the

591.45 --> 595.529
darkness that I really didn't know how

593.22 --> 598.22
to respond to that was that used to be

595.529 --> 605.37
kind of my method as a very young kid to

598.22 --> 606.9
get through that until my liberal Ness

605.37 --> 609.0600000000001
caught up with me

606.9 --> 613.62
and I think I understand pretty much

609.06 --> 616.41
when that happened it's in a certain

613.62 --> 620.91
school period in the school where I got

616.41 --> 623.9699999999999
the most bullied the most horribly and I

620.91 --> 626.13
never got that never got what that was

623.97 --> 628.14
but there were apparently a great number

626.13 --> 630.89
of Christians there and I think that at

628.14 --> 633.81
some point some discussion came up about

630.89 --> 635.9399999999999
well you know what is forbidden by God

633.81 --> 637.92
and everything and I probably went

635.94 --> 640.0500000000001
straight into that like an ultra liberal

637.92 --> 641.79
said like no it's okay to be this and

640.05 --> 645.8389999999999
it's okay to be that and even that and

641.79 --> 647.8199999999999
even that like almost like what the [ __ ]

645.839 --> 650.73
they're trying to pull over us right now

647.82 --> 653.279
like saying no pedophilia is okay like I

650.73 --> 657.57
will have to admit when I was a very

653.279 --> 659.199
very young kid like a preteen I thought

657.57 --> 662.499
that like

659.199 --> 668.529
can't be that bad right like I wanna

662.499 --> 670.5400000000001
love to as a kid I was very yeah I

668.529 --> 672.73
wanted to know what that was like and

670.54 --> 676.629
everything always looked forward to like

672.73 --> 679.859
oh when I'm an adult I can engage in

676.629 --> 682.089
romantic stuff and yeah longed for that

679.859 --> 684.22
and I thought no there's nothing wrong

682.089 --> 687.0400000000001
with that but yeah it's speaking out

684.22 --> 690.6990000000001
about it oh my god I had no idea what I

687.04 --> 694.3589999999999
was saying basically and people yeah you

690.699 --> 698.319
get an ultra right-wing versus left wing

694.359 --> 701.1990000000001
fight in a very early age and my god

698.319 --> 704.3389999999999
and I was just a little kid have no idea

701.199 --> 707.199
what I was doing and my classmates just

704.339 --> 711.2790000000001
like suddenly declared me like the devil

707.199 --> 713.319
and now that fits because I remember

711.279 --> 717.749
that part the whole bullying [ __ ] that

713.319 --> 720.81
came out of it and I kind of like okay

717.749 --> 723.63
these liberal thoughts that I had

720.81 --> 727.8
and I thought oh god they're so bad out

723.63 --> 732.26
here I just have to like don't don't

727.8 --> 732.26
talk about it don't think about it just

732.44 --> 737.49
try to do with the world whatever I can

735.21 --> 744.21
do at the time now it's not what I

737.49 --> 748.62
thought it was that [ __ ] and this yeah

744.21 --> 752.84
being a liberal meaning well you accept

748.62 --> 752.84
things that you just don't understand

755.519 --> 762.449
you just want to believe that everything

757.74 --> 764.9590000000001
can be okay you know it's innocent and

762.449 --> 764.959
naive

767.05 --> 772.18
but yeah I bet you those from the

770.08 --> 777.1800000000001
liberal sections that allow themselves

772.18 --> 782.9499999999999
to actually wander into this perversion

777.18 --> 788.0699999999999
too far yeah you can't be innocent and

782.95 --> 792.21
naive and nice once you do that once you

788.07 --> 792.21
once you go there it's just

794.23 --> 799.09
you open up these gates you open up

796.75 --> 801.97
these holes in your consciousness and

799.09 --> 807.37
things become worse corruption sets in

801.97 --> 809.89
so whatever led you safely through going

807.37 --> 813.07
there that's no longer there to protect

809.89 --> 815.91
you it fades away it extinguishes as a

813.07 --> 815.9100000000001
side effect

823.68 --> 837.4699999999999
these creepy stuff all creepy stuff

828.98 --> 839.9590000000001
anyway Nick I see Jadwin Thorsen bill G

837.47 --> 846.6800000000001
was a very funny joke about eating

839.959 --> 850.279
clocks and watches leb and um Julie

846.68 --> 856.81
Bennett [ __ ] use resin tintin monocle

850.279 --> 864.5
Daniel / McCool be spherical cow

856.81 --> 873.7399999999999
Karen be michael righteous force dank je

864.5 --> 875.63
je and Dre up browning jazz akanda yeah

873.74 --> 878.199
you can add it down thread of you Casey

875.63 --> 878.199
here Steve

881.56 --> 885.4799999999999
so oh yeah you some husky

888.139 --> 894.299
anyway hope talking about this [ __ ] is

892.559 --> 902.1
not too disturbing to be fair it is

894.299 --> 904.369
disturbing to me it's it's so weird it's

902.1 --> 904.369
like

905.13 --> 914.05
nowadays it's I see the respect like the

908.649 --> 915.58
whole pedophilia thing is so just put

914.05 --> 917.4699999999999
out there and there's people like

915.58 --> 923.7090000000001
talking about it all over the place and

917.47 --> 925.0600000000001
it's freaks me out it's like I get I

923.709 --> 926.9499999999999
totally get it

925.06 --> 931.2399999999999
you know the anger but with me it just

926.95 --> 934.029
freaks me out maybe it is because I was

931.24 --> 936.61
on the other side of that fence when it

934.029 --> 940.18
was very young and innocent and so it

936.61 --> 942.839
just scares me it scares me that I was

940.18 --> 942.8389999999999
there I'd

945.25 --> 952.92
with my mind and in my heart in a way

949.39 --> 955.3
and now to see that I would that that

952.92 --> 958.99
that was not what I thought it's all

955.3 --> 963.6099999999999
scary i I can't really get angry of it I

958.99 --> 969.88
get absolutely nauseated from it like it

963.61 --> 973.0
creeps the hell out of me but I don't

969.88 --> 977.05
know I see him to just have a flight

973.0 --> 984.43
response maybe maybe it just needs more

977.05 --> 987.5999999999999
time you know in in a way like even

984.43 --> 991.9899999999999
believing that I think when retrospect

987.6 --> 997.72
may have caused damage spiritually

991.99 --> 1001.67
unwittingly and I'm just now trying to

997.72 --> 1001.6700000000001
slowly try to fix it

1002.6 --> 1008.45
dispel all that weird liberal garbage

1005.9 --> 1012.52
from my past the parts that were

1008.45 --> 1012.5200000000001
actually garbage that were too much

1026.11 --> 1031.6
anyway

1028.4 --> 1031.6000000000001
I'm glad to see you guys

1036.18 --> 1039.8600000000001
what are you talking about

1043.19 --> 1048.13
do you know arguing among yourselves

1052.57 --> 1057.8999999999999
P Mars strolling up the place come on

1058.47 --> 1065.19
thanks nobody actually responding to the

1061.12 --> 1065.1899999999998
things I'm saying it's just great

1085.66 --> 1093.3700000000001
I just watched Owen Benjamin by the way

1089.02 --> 1095.71
was again very intense as well I I can

1093.37 --> 1097.4399999999998
feel that he's kind of in his own way

1095.71 --> 1102.58
trying the same thing

1097.44 --> 1108.059
it was noticeably carrying weight it's

1102.58 --> 1108.059
trying to he walks the path

1109.55 --> 1114.6599999999999
anyway

1112.03 --> 1114.66
yeah

1128.7 --> 1131.419
I just

1145.01 --> 1147.7
god

1155.41 --> 1165.5800000000002
yeah P Mars you can't defeat racism by

1159.16 --> 1169.68
becoming racist now actually the way to

1165.58 --> 1169.6799999999998
defeat it is to not emphasize it

1173.76 --> 1181.74
and only address a derogatory spirit

1178.68 --> 1184.29
when it arises it's not about any tack

1181.74 --> 1186.47
it's just about the derogatory spirit

1184.29 --> 1186.47
day

1190.84 --> 1194.25
the judgment and

1197.47 --> 1206.27
automatically putting a category beneath

1202.34 --> 1207.53
you that is basically it that's racism

1206.27 --> 1211.97
that's all of it

1207.53 --> 1214.51
and it's not about the tag it's about

1211.97 --> 1214.51
the act

1218.07 --> 1226.29
and if you're trolling with tags yeah

1223.74 --> 1231.18
technically you may not be racist but

1226.29 --> 1234.42
your riling it up it exposure makes

1231.18 --> 1237.89
plant seeds so yeah you don't I don't

1234.42 --> 1245.04
think it's just don't need to do that

1237.89 --> 1249.3200000000002
now it's useless keeps us all

1245.04 --> 1249.32
preoccupied with this simplistic

1249.5 --> 1258.14
battlefronts that are technicalities in

1254.85 --> 1258.1399999999999
the grand scale of things

1278.43 --> 1283.4
that's a good one you summer house cute

1280.47 --> 1283.4
it's hilarious

1283.94 --> 1292.04
that maybe before the politicians

1288.31 --> 1297.74
everything was always liberal virtual

1292.04 --> 1300.17
signalling but in a kind of extreme

1297.74 --> 1304.52
counter response they are now doing the

1300.17 --> 1306.41
opposite and actually fascist virtual

1304.52 --> 1311.27
cycling because they believe oh yeah

1306.41 --> 1314.0900000000001
they're gonna be the winners because the

1311.27 --> 1317.68
light side is the fascists according to

1314.09 --> 1321.4099999999999
them and they just see it like that and

1317.68 --> 1324.29
over extremophiles oh maybe maybe it is

1321.41 --> 1327.5900000000001
right maybe the attractive virtue signal

1324.29 --> 1332.74
to the enemy that is just completely out

1327.59 --> 1332.74
of place that would be very typical

1336.52 --> 1342.7
or maybe maybe that's just what they

1340.78 --> 1348.76
have inside maybe that is just what they

1342.7 --> 1353.2
deal with and I don't know it's so weird

1348.76 --> 1358.35
it's all so weird apparatus what they do

1353.2 --> 1358.3500000000001
it is so out there it is so surreal now

1359.94 --> 1365.169
like

1362.53 --> 1367.6299999999999
it makes me nervous to think like what

1365.169 --> 1371.2
it would be like to be one of those

1367.63 --> 1377.8600000000001
people in that machine being subjected

1371.2 --> 1383.159
being part of that out-of-control code

1377.86 --> 1383.1589999999999
of conduct that's so freaky

1389.64 --> 1394.5200000000002
it is almost a mystery that it's

1391.89 --> 1394.5200000000002
possible

1399.07 --> 1404.79
right it's a my house key the best of

1402.37 --> 1406.9599999999998
jokes I always have a wide

1404.79 --> 1411.18
multi-dimensional scale meaning to it

1406.96 --> 1413.74
that's what makes them so good person

1411.18 --> 1417.76
bringing them forth doesn't always need

1413.74 --> 1424.29
to see all of that to be able to

1417.76 --> 1424.29
manifest it just rings forth

1499.17 --> 1504.3000000000002
chad is all in chaos now great

1505.2 --> 1512.71
every time I seek for help out there

1508.84 --> 1516.6399999999999
with you guys it's always like bickering

1512.71 --> 1521.67

1516.64 --> 1525.0600000000002
is that really what you came here for is

1521.67 --> 1525.0600000000002

1672.27 --> 1682.4
we have to now do this and it feels like

1676.04 --> 1688.86
no that's not that's not for you and

1682.4 --> 1691.74
it's like okay what everything suggests

1688.86 --> 1695.1
that I should do something like that

1691.74 --> 1697.98
what's going on here very confusing to

1695.1 --> 1704.9399999999998
me I have to do what I have to do and

1697.98 --> 1707.75
look I just basically want things to

1704.94 --> 1707.75
turn out all right

1710.14 --> 1714.2990000000002
I want life to move on

1716.31 --> 1721.22
and whatever is going to be lost

1724.5 --> 1731.15
make it a make it a kind of loss that we

1727.2 --> 1731.15
can survive all of us

1734.12 --> 1737.4699999999998
I don't know what it is

1739.19 --> 1741.73
you know

1752.05 --> 1760.6499999999999
ah I like it when I say yeah I like it

1756.34 --> 1760.6499999999999
too it's usually a sigh of relief

1764.67 --> 1770.46
building up tension we're gonna say

1767.16 --> 1775.3100000000002
something and then it's like no okay

1770.46 --> 1778.58
let's go detention again that's it

1775.31 --> 1780.35
anyway yeah hey Alan B where are you you

1778.58 --> 1788.74
know I gave you a link like 10 minutes

1780.35 --> 1788.74
ago so what you doing

1794.2 --> 1797.799

didn't ask for a link Ali be

1868.33 --> 1873.6499999999999
I'm not doing it in the earlybird chat

1871.4 --> 1876.0500000000002
allenby I'm doing it in our chat where

1873.65 --> 1878.44
you just spoke to me I just reposted the

1876.05 --> 1878.44
link

1889.32 --> 1895.37
at telling me you can't see that you're

1892.86 --> 1895.37
serious

1902.59 --> 1905.1589999999999
but

1909.7 --> 1917.44
okay there's something really weird

1911.23 --> 1922.41
going on the Skype blocking blotting out

1917.44 --> 1922.41
the link good morning

1926.72 --> 1933.409
warning Arwen ah see work anyway

1930.759 --> 1934.239
how we doing this week we got a good

1933.409 --> 1939.769
weekend

1934.239 --> 1942.499
yeah bit tense bit tense why stuff

1939.769 --> 1945.169
happening in the world there's always

1942.499 --> 1950.359
stuff happening yeah and this time this

1945.169 --> 1954.3790000000001
stuff is pretty tense so yeah you're a

1950.359 --> 1956.9789999999998
bit down about it just very nervous I

1954.379 --> 1961.4789999999998
got no very ominous feeling about it

1956.979 --> 1961.479
about what in particular anything

1965.139 --> 1973.82
politics life you sure it's there's like

1971.479 --> 1976.789
well if there's like a stalemate right

1973.82 --> 1980.09
now but the dark side is still gaining

1976.789 --> 1983.6589999999999
ground and some things got a break and

1980.09 --> 1987.59
it's gonna cause damage noticeable

1983.659 --> 1990.919
damage that can't be shoved under the

1987.59 --> 1993.83
mat kind of damage and I'm very nervous

1990.919 --> 1998.269
of it because of the cascading effect it

1993.83 --> 2003.1899999999998
will absolutely have on the world but

1998.269 --> 2005.95
yeah if doesn't break there's no true

2003.19 --> 2008.169
action then yeah the darkness will

2005.95 --> 2011.22
gradually more and more overcome maybe

2008.169 --> 2011.22
this is like the

2014.1 --> 2023.9499999999998
the point of no return and the ship is

2019.69 --> 2028.72
waiting not sure if it should go further

2023.95 --> 2030.04
that kind of set up feeling right that

2028.72 --> 2033.19
doesn't sound too positive

2030.04 --> 2035.98
so it isn't exactly it is very unnerving

2033.19 --> 2040.71
but yeah on the other side you have the

2035.98 --> 2043.44
belief but the thing is about champions

2040.71 --> 2046.03
about champions of the light one

2043.44 --> 2048.79
wherever they are and whatever front

2046.03 --> 2052.77
they are if they falter and they fall

2048.79 --> 2055.72
then absolutely it is inevitable by

2052.77 --> 2059.95
balance of the light and darkness itself

2055.72 --> 2063.79
that a new champion will rise but yeah

2059.95 --> 2067.95
that takes time and in that time the

2063.79 --> 2067.95
darkness will cause more damage

2075.93 --> 2081.7
so yeah in that sense I'd almost say

2079.6 --> 2085.9
like know it maybe it's better to just

2081.7 --> 2087.5099999999998
go a radical and I'm just thinking like

2085.9 --> 2091.5
my god

2087.51 --> 2095.2000000000003
example these people what could they do

2091.5 --> 2097.03
you could just assess and make a whole

2095.2 --> 2102.1
bunch of people over the world there

2097.03 --> 2105.28
that maniacal they have that power that

2102.1 --> 2108.73
[ __ ] and so them it's like yeah it's

2105.28 --> 2111.5800000000004
just my my self-defense you know it's

2108.73 --> 2113.83
like my last stand like you can take me

2111.58 --> 2116.59
out or are you gonna do this then please

2113.83 --> 2119.0499999999997
stop behaving like a freaking maniac I

2116.59 --> 2119.92
can't do that of course because that's

2119.05 --> 2122.6200000000003
just who I am

2119.92 --> 2126.64
and that's the freaking sickness of the

2122.62 --> 2130.2599999999998
entire situation you could have us have

2126.64 --> 2134.64
maneuvered themselves in positions where

2130.26 --> 2139.09
their sickness can just spout out and in

2134.64 --> 2141.64
unavailable like Thrones of darkness and

2139.09 --> 2147.8500000000004
there's like if you want to topple the

2141.64 --> 2149.1099999999997
throne then things will blow up pretty

2147.85 --> 2152.11
dark thoughts from you

2149.11 --> 2154.78
I feel more so sir is it there is it

2152.11 --> 2160.06
just in sight I don't know I don't know

2154.78 --> 2162.9700000000003
I had a brilliant weekend okay good for

2160.06 --> 2164.7999999999997
you well yeah I thought you were doing

2162.97 --> 2166.4199999999996
okay I thought you're doing that look

2164.8 --> 2167.9500000000003
that new venture with you doubt and

2166.42 --> 2172.51
things were looking up and looking

2167.95 --> 2174.21
pretty good for you yeah you said you

2172.51 --> 2178.9900000000002
were gonna do something with you dad

2174.21 --> 2181.11
couple of weeks ago you went to a

2178.99 --> 2184.4199999999996
meeting with Alan during the Christmas

2181.11 --> 2186.73
no you took it I think it sounded like

2184.42 --> 2194.7400000000002
you talked about doing a business with

2186.73 --> 2199.45
him also that sounded quite promising he

2194.74 --> 2201.1899999999996
does yeah looks me up she goes it's not

2199.45 --> 2203.24
like Oh

2201.19 --> 2205.15
suddenly out of nowhere I'll be a

2203.24 --> 2207.859
freakin billionaire or something now

2205.15 --> 2216.4300000000003
well something to look forward to or

2207.859 --> 2216.43
it's basically a an anchor for when yeah

2216.579 --> 2222.5600000000004
financial in a sort of financial

2220.069 --> 2225.41
collapse situation it will be a life

2222.56 --> 2227.869
saver that thing if you're completely

2225.41 --> 2230.0
reliant on the state totally you don't

2227.869 --> 2232.31
have your own sources you could

2230.0 --> 2238.01
potentially be screwed in the coming

2232.31 --> 2239.349
period one way or the other is it worth

2238.01 --> 2242.5400000000004
the risk

2239.349 --> 2245.0
what do you mean sometimes it's worth

2242.54 --> 2251.75
taking a risk to see whether you can

2245.0 --> 2256.04
come out the other side I don't

2251.75 --> 2257.63
understand the context well you see you

2256.04 --> 2259.7599999999998
said well if you went in with your dad

2257.63 --> 2262.52
or jumped into that and made a real good

2259.76 --> 2264.849
go of it because you you're saying you

2262.52 --> 2270.349
were fed up of relying on the state

2264.849 --> 2273.65
maybe that could be a thing right well

2270.349 --> 2276.88
yeah look that is what that company

2273.65 --> 2276.88
thing is about

2277.76 --> 2281.48
that's supposed to talk about it

2279.44 --> 2283.85
elaborately like according to their

2281.48 --> 2287.42
current rules so Gabriel is being

2283.85 --> 2290.1189999999997
attacked judicially almost as

2287.42 --> 2291.29
elaborately as like Trump and everything

2290.119 --> 2294.77
is being attacked

2291.29 --> 2297.17
mirages of the lawyers just trolling the

2294.77 --> 2298.97
[ __ ] out of the company and you're

2297.17 --> 2302.17
trying to turn it into a circus act

2298.97 --> 2306.2
rules and [ __ ] that make no sense pure

2302.17 --> 2308.4500000000003
bureaucracy barrage so yeah and that

2306.2 --> 2311.359
means again that it is something serious

2308.45 --> 2313.8799999999997
it is real it is really separate and

2311.359 --> 2318.25
it's my belief that it could be the core

2313.88 --> 2322.3
foundation or a firm an early example of

2318.25 --> 2327.29
how libertarian ebert arianism can be

2322.3 --> 2330.59
manifested by true in the financial true

2327.29 --> 2332.84
independence because that is really

2330.59 --> 2336.07
where most of the power come from

2332.84 --> 2338.21
doesn't it in the end

2336.07 --> 2341.92
that's how they will that's how the

2338.21 --> 2341.92
government wields its power through

2342.1 --> 2350.63
finances and dependence on those

2345.109 --> 2352.73
finances yes this one controller it's

2350.63 --> 2356.51
one control method that they use keep

2352.73 --> 2358.869
people poor keep them down keep them

2356.51 --> 2361.8100000000004
away but I don't know about you but the

2358.869 --> 2364.54
libraries are still okay in the UK so I

2361.81 --> 2369.41
couldn't read a lot do you read a lot

2364.54 --> 2374.24
nope you thought about it I think about

2369.41 --> 2376.22
everything look can you get a free

2374.24 --> 2378.56
library ticket get free books out do

2376.22 --> 2384.47
research I've heard that many many many

2378.56 --> 2386.63
times my lifetime no always good I

2384.47 --> 2390.3399999999997
always enjoy a good book and learning

2386.63 --> 2390.34
new things it's always great

2392.529 --> 2402.73
are you okay yeah just right down yeah

2400.43 --> 2402.73
well

2405.15 --> 2410.64
whole situation you know just because

2408.39 --> 2413.1299999999997
you're now doing like superficial talk

2410.64 --> 2415.47
doesn't mean that what I'm dealing with

2413.13 --> 2419.07
is going away it's just on standby and

2415.47 --> 2421.9199999999996
you're still gonna see it coming inquiry

2419.07 --> 2427.23
I know and I'm just telling you why

2421.92 --> 2432.17
you're seeing what you're seeing well

2427.23 --> 2437.1
Alicia honest about it yes it's critical

2432.17 --> 2439.94
wanna see is the the absolute main

2437.1 --> 2439.94
foundation

2444.46 --> 2450.23
and it's worth taking the risk yeah I

2448.4 --> 2453.28
guess I don't follow any path I just do

2450.23 --> 2453.28
what I want these days

2461.559 --> 2467.42
do you have do you have any of the

2464.599 --> 2470.509
robbers apart from this our photography

2467.42 --> 2474.099
drawing I know you do the Dungeons &

2470.509 --> 2476.569
Dragons how's that going steady she goes

2474.099 --> 2478.96
she been doing that quite a while on it

2476.569 --> 2484.609
yeah half my life

2478.96 --> 2489.71
what's up 20 years yeah you still enjoy

2484.609 --> 2491.15
that it's a joyful life how comes you

2489.71 --> 2495.859
haven't written any short stories and

2491.15 --> 2497.539
then things like that cuz shifted all

2495.859 --> 2501.49
the storylines and the characters and

2497.539 --> 2505.029
things like that don't you well I am

2501.49 --> 2508.5789999999997
kind of writing a story of the adventure

2505.029 --> 2511.519
so and I have made short stories I've

2508.579 --> 2514.69
made science fiction stories okay but I

2511.519 --> 2519.74
don't publish them it's just like I

2514.69 --> 2522.849
don't know it's it's not like that it's

2519.74 --> 2522.8489999999997
just something

2525.1 --> 2533.68
I'm doing this I didn't really publish

2531.88 --> 2538.9
like my trolls and tyrants book either

2533.68 --> 2541.8399999999997
it's just out there for free that but

2538.9 --> 2547.06
you go skills you see wanted to do you

2541.84 --> 2549.67
you may use this I'm just putting

2547.06 --> 2552.12
suggestions up and things out there for

2549.67 --> 2555.1
skills that you've already caught

2552.12 --> 2558.9
you've obviously you know about story

2555.1 --> 2558.9
arcs and things are absolutely yeah

2559.17 --> 2568.87
narratives your cultures the inevitable

2565.06 --> 2571.09
motions of decisions and everything yeah

2568.87 --> 2573.2799999999997
that that's what I am talking about

2571.09 --> 2576.73
right now and the context is the world

2573.28 --> 2579.88
that's been the subject in the last few

2576.73 --> 2581.77
weeks and yeah you can do this with a

2579.88 --> 2584.4100000000003
game you can do this with a science

2581.77 --> 2588.54
fiction story and you can do it with the

2584.41 --> 2588.54
real world because it is all

2589.11 --> 2598.56
derived from the same essence as AG the

2594.75 --> 2600.63
patterns are persistent and if they

2598.56 --> 2602.79
would not be in a story if they would

2600.63 --> 2605.04
the patterns of how that things

2602.79 --> 2607.5
naturally are L would be too deviating

2605.04 --> 2613.17
then it would be not pleasurable to

2607.5 --> 2616.92
experience may be seen as disruptive so

2613.17 --> 2619.8
yeah the good stories are very much a

2616.92 --> 2625.17
reflection of workings of the real world

2619.8 --> 2627.8700000000003
that's what grips us very true very true

2625.17 --> 2631.16
but I don't think you should take the

2627.87 --> 2631.16
weight of the world on your shoulders

2633.41 --> 2641.22
well no it's not corrects but I don't

2638.55 --> 2645.3
think you should are you telling at last

2641.22 --> 2647.4599999999996
to drop the ball but am I telling

2645.3 --> 2650.73
somebody to drop the ball oh come on

2647.46 --> 2654.7200000000003
Alan be you get this come on are you

2650.73 --> 2657.69
telling Attalus to drop the ball no no

2654.72 --> 2660.93
no oh right well how can you then tell

2657.69 --> 2664.02
me like well why are you carrying this

2660.93 --> 2666.21
weight just tell me why do you think I'm

2664.02 --> 2669.18
doing it I think I'm doing it because I

2666.21 --> 2670.41
think it's fun does it do your running

2669.18 --> 2673.83
cook yes

2670.41 --> 2677.5699999999997
you think so yes it does but not in the

2673.83 --> 2681.2999999999997
way that is very immediately apparent

2677.57 --> 2685.38
okay but yeah as I said the rewards of

2681.3 --> 2688.4700000000003
the path are imminent what you think the

2685.38 --> 2690.65
rewards will be what comes from the

2688.47 --> 2690.6499999999996
light

2691.29 --> 2700.32
the light reaches out as well is that a

2695.91 --> 2701.97
spiritual light it's the other side you

2700.32 --> 2707.69
have the demons and the goodness and you

2701.97 --> 2710.7599999999998
look the angels and the light mmm there

2707.69 --> 2714.51
sounds very apocalyptic no it's seeing

2710.76 --> 2718.2900000000004
in the yang it's just two faces of the

2714.51 --> 2721.76
same metal basically in energy-wise but

2718.29 --> 2723.6
they are fundamentally different

2721.76 --> 2727.44
fundamentally different and the same

2723.6 --> 2732.54
like the shadows and the vorlons it's

2727.44 --> 2734.52
the same concept okay well if you think

2732.54 --> 2741.45
is something you got to go through and

2734.52 --> 2743.49
that's up to you nice to see you in a

2741.45 --> 2749.7
white shirt if I may make the mood a

2743.49 --> 2758.2999999999997
little lighter right yeah I felt I

2749.7 --> 2758.2999999999997
needed to contrast what happen yesterday

2758.57 --> 2765.2000000000003
just because I was starting to falter

2765.38 --> 2773.76
falter yeah from worrying the weight

2769.19 --> 2775.29
okay what does what does fall treat

2773.76 --> 2781.17
involve going back to the globe like

2775.29 --> 2782.94
those no no that's never gonna happen so

2781.17 --> 2783.6800000000003
you know a flips it's not even required

2782.94 --> 2788.16
okay

2783.68 --> 2789.99
globe versus let earth in in the current

2788.16 --> 2793.0499999999997
situation that's not even really

2789.99 --> 2795.5699999999997
relevant it is relevant of course

2793.05 --> 2799.2000000000003
because it was still part of the legal

2795.57 --> 2805.05
assistance to versus fundamental life

2799.2 --> 2806.48
but there it's no you look there's no

2805.05 --> 2812.8100000000004
use for me to go

2806.48 --> 2814.16
it doesn't work I tried it I tried it

2812.81 --> 2818.39
and you didn't want to kick well you

2814.16 --> 2822.02
know no I tried it and I just stumbled

2818.39 --> 2823.339
back it's like what Oh what is this oh

2822.02 --> 2825.53
look at these old maps this is

2823.339 --> 2831.23
fascinating what's going on and then oh

2825.53 --> 2836.2400000000002
[ __ ] it's freakin flat again I can't

2831.23 --> 2838.51
help it I'm too curious July the

2836.24 --> 2843.589
conspiracy will better

2838.51 --> 2848.03
no no Flat Earth is actually quite

2843.589 --> 2852.47
serene a place to stick to with your

2848.03 --> 2855.02
mind except for the trolls of course to

2852.47 --> 2859.91
counterbalance that it's actually quite

2855.02 --> 2863.69
peaceful and neutral and how many flat

2859.91 --> 2865.49
earthers do worry so much about what's

2863.69 --> 2871.339
happening in politics and the other

2865.49 --> 2873.109
conspiracies really really I think most

2871.339 --> 2875.569
just like sticking really to Flat Earth

2873.109 --> 2877.5789999999997
and getting good at that and there's

2875.569 --> 2882.92
still so much to work out there so much

2877.579 --> 2886.79
to do what big thing what one thing do

2882.92 --> 2893.54
you think needs working out really

2886.79 --> 2897.23
working out solidifying re-engineering

2893.54 --> 2900.859
of another reengineering just reverse

2897.23 --> 2906.17
engineering true optics in its entirety

2900.859 --> 2909.43
and it's a very big so much data so much

2906.17 --> 2912.4900000000002
complexities it's on another depth level

2909.43 --> 2916.73
compared to the other knowledge is and

2912.49 --> 2919.9399999999996
it's been taken from from the general

2916.73 --> 2921.98
schooling from the consciousness so we

2919.94 --> 2924.17
have to really figure out all of these

2921.98 --> 2928.25
things all these approaches and just see

2924.17 --> 2930.23
like what is it what is it what's really

2928.25 --> 2931.97
going on here and I've seen some very

2930.23 --> 2935.67
convincing new material

2931.97 --> 2938.3289999999997
grantees a couple of days ago doesn't

2935.67 --> 2943.9500000000003
necessarily have to be the final

2938.329 --> 2946.3390000000004
conclusion to that and the end the

2943.95 --> 2948.18
problem the main problem will always be

2946.339 --> 2951.0299999999997
understanding the confine without

2948.18 --> 2953.7799999999997
understanding the qualified you don't

2951.03 --> 2958.26
know all the factors and that's just

2953.78 --> 2963.75
gonna always be a problem what do you

2958.26 --> 2969.0890000000004
mean by um true optics the workings of

2963.75 --> 2972.53
light and sight okay do you think we

2969.089 --> 2975.599
don't understand that oh the general

2972.53 --> 2984.059
public's conception of it is absolutely

2975.599 --> 2986.55
abysmal yes okay so you think we need to

2984.059 --> 2989.94
do a lot more work on that lenses and

2986.55 --> 2991.71
explaining mirages and optical slumps

2989.94 --> 2995.73
and things like that that's where we

2991.71 --> 2999.21
need to be focusing if you like to be

2995.73 --> 3004.01
well I'm just saying I think that is

2999.21 --> 3006.859
where there is we got there we arrived

3004.01 --> 3009.0490000000004
there and there is more to be gained so

3006.859 --> 3012.2
that is just something we can work on

3009.049 --> 3015.92
and we will know that there it will be

3012.2 --> 3019.0
results from it quite certain I am quite

3015.92 --> 3019.0
certain there will be

3021.51 --> 3030.21
okay well how would do we go about now

3024.21 --> 3035.52
what's the next move everybody's already

3030.21 --> 3038.31
in the middle of it people are doing

3035.52 --> 3041.7
their work their research some of them

3038.31 --> 3045.119
are making presentations and we are then

3041.7 --> 3047.3689999999997
spreading those conclusions those

3045.119 --> 3050.8500000000004
results and trying to reap özil

3047.369 --> 3052.65
everything like okay is it completely

3050.85 --> 3054.48
right where is it not right where is it

3052.65 --> 3057.03
uncertain how does this fit in with

3054.48 --> 3060.84
everything else what requires

3057.03 --> 3063.63
replacement do you think ultimately the

3060.84 --> 3072.9900000000002
ones would understand that it will lead

3063.63 --> 3075.869
to a updated model well yeah an updated

3072.99 --> 3079.3199999999997
a very much updated visual model

3075.869 --> 3082.6800000000003
definitely look if you got true up if

3079.32 --> 3085.3500000000004
you master true optics as they are then

3082.68 --> 3090.27
you could assimilate in a computer with

3085.35 --> 3094.65
if you apply all of it adequately good

3090.27 --> 3099.03
enough then you could get pretty amazing

3094.65 --> 3101.46
real like simulations of things they'll

3099.03 --> 3104.5800000000004
just look exactly with the Mirage in

3101.46 --> 3108.6
Zone in all these effects and once you

3104.58 --> 3113.13
get there when you can actually see

3108.6 --> 3116.67
those elements arrive naturally within

3113.13 --> 3119.9100000000003
the rendering of the simulation then you

3116.67 --> 3123.1800000000003
know you got something that's very close

3119.91 --> 3125.99
at least to reality and again from that

3123.18 --> 3129.0899999999997
point move on understanding like

3125.99 --> 3132.27
actually changing the independent

3129.09 --> 3137.119
variables within the simulation and see

3132.27 --> 3137.119
what changes in the manifestations

3142.39 --> 3146.12
sounds like a lot of work no it's not

3145.55 --> 3148.3100000000004
breathing

3146.12 --> 3151.0299999999997
in the end that's gonna be extremely

3148.31 --> 3154.46
easy the biggest problem is gonna be

3151.03 --> 3158.0600000000004
gathering all the data that's required

3154.46 --> 3163.07
and getting an oversight as to what is

3158.06 --> 3165.83
required to get it right do you think do

3163.07 --> 3168.9100000000003
you think flats got the people to do

3165.83 --> 3171.02
that yeah

3168.91 --> 3173.89
who do you think it's gonna do it you

3171.02 --> 3176.12
think if he call we're gonna do that

3173.89 --> 3180.74
riling heavenly are now gone three of

3176.12 --> 3183.04
you it's yes so you see is a more of a

3180.74 --> 3192.2
group effort

3183.04 --> 3196.46
well that tap into it momentum the whole

3192.2 --> 3202.33
process will gain yes and you think

3196.46 --> 3202.33
you're pretty close yeah

3203.97 --> 3212.72
well that's good I look forward to

3205.95 --> 3212.72
seeing the results sure you do I do

3216.47 --> 3222.359
she'll be good fun to see a new model

3219.99 --> 3225.45
and new explorations and new maps

3222.359 --> 3230.19
I hear Antonio's publishing a book with

3225.45 --> 3232.98
a new updated knock on it and that

3230.19 --> 3235.91
she'll be out so if he core are doing a

3232.98 --> 3239.069
lot of experiments Tony's doing his

3235.91 --> 3240.66
education thing so this should be quite

3239.069 --> 3244.52
a lot of stuff going off this year then

3240.66 --> 3244.52
of course there will

3249.43 --> 3256.64
pretty soon you'll be getting a new

3252.619 --> 3258.859
microphone I hope so and that hopefully

3256.64 --> 3261.6189999999997
a camera then we could see some footage

3258.859 --> 3265.73
from the top of your roof a new camera

3261.619 --> 3268.339
oh you mean yeah yeah I hope so

3265.73 --> 3272.42
I don't know how fast that'll go I got

3268.339 --> 3275.45
some promises here but you know seeing

3272.42 --> 3278.7200000000003
is believing I think that'd be great

3275.45 --> 3280.339
I think that'd be great if you could get

3278.72 --> 3284.0
out and do some observations I think

3280.339 --> 3285.4
you'd love that I think that give you a

3284.0 --> 3288.349
real sense of purpose

3285.4 --> 3292.1600000000003
no just temporarily

3288.349 --> 3295.869
it'll get boring eventually if I don't

3292.16 --> 3299.27
actually move on to other locations but

3295.869 --> 3300.38
everything in due time yeah well you're

3299.27 --> 3303.2599999999998
gonna have a problem well you shouldn't

3300.38 --> 3308.92
have much problem proving it's flat soon

3303.26 --> 3312.25
as you live in the Netherlands well

3308.92 --> 3324.4700000000003
that's all a matter of perspective

3312.25 --> 3327.5
because it's that was a joke oh but yeah

3324.47 --> 3328.9399999999996
there's there's not many really flat

3327.5 --> 3333.48
arisings because there's a lot of

3328.94 --> 3335.9700000000003
freakin buildings everywhere but

3333.48 --> 3340.29
I would like to at some point like Gulf

3335.97 --> 3345.7099999999996
to the coast and try to film across the

3340.29 --> 3348.0589999999997
water to one of the islands that works

3345.71 --> 3351.42
yeah that'd be good Flint man got some

3348.059 --> 3356.7000000000003
beautiful buildings you know Creek that

3351.42 --> 3360.809
you like the border boots with a board

3356.7 --> 3362.819
of Regulus board yep no I don't I barely

3360.809 --> 3370.17
know what's really even going on there

3362.819 --> 3373.95
I know a lot is going on but well I'm

3370.17 --> 3375.9
not a guy that's like oh yeah let me get

3373.95 --> 3381.359
in between there and be a part of all

3375.9 --> 3384.589
that no it's never been that way always

3381.359 --> 3388.77
been like the odd one out

3384.589 --> 3391.92
well all your life yeah well there's

3388.77 --> 3394.47
nothing wrong with that nothing wrong a

3391.92 --> 3397.829
lot of good at it outsiders have done

3394.47 --> 3400.1699999999996
great things I try to do it like I I do

3397.829 --> 3400.799
want to be part of that it just doesn't

3400.17 --> 3405.9
work

3400.799 --> 3407.7599999999998
I tried well that's nothing to worry

3405.9 --> 3411.51
about I'm sure there's lots people like

3407.76 --> 3415.67
that no I'm just I don't know maybe I'm

3411.51 --> 3417.869
too much in my own way my frequency or

3415.67 --> 3419.48
intelligence or my understanding or

3417.869 --> 3421.829
whatever the hell that is

3419.48 --> 3424.98
there's just a lot of people that can't

3421.829 --> 3430.44
take it but I can't act like it's not

3424.98 --> 3432.299
there okay so you think it's more like

3430.44 --> 3437.58
social skills and other people's

3432.299 --> 3443.49
understanding yeah yeah

3437.58 --> 3446.27
and look I can like for example not talk

3443.49 --> 3452.5499999999997
about Flat Earth that's that's doable

3446.27 --> 3454.65
but the stay mentally basic and act like

3452.55 --> 3460.4700000000003
there's nothing going on in here that's

3454.65 --> 3463.73
something that doesn't work right does

3460.47 --> 3466.0499999999997
it doesn't work what do you feel about

3463.73 --> 3469.35
taking part in the conference is going

3466.05 --> 3473.1000000000004
on in Amsterdam that sounds like a ideal

3469.35 --> 3475.56
opportunity for you to meet like-minded

3473.1 --> 3477.2999999999997
people a conference thing yeah I was

3475.56 --> 3482.13
thinking about that when was that I

3477.3 --> 3490.23
never got a but believe it sometime in

3482.13 --> 3494.3
the summer no no demo go there

3490.23 --> 3496.89
definitely well why aren't you

3494.3 --> 3506.4
approaching them and asked asking to be

3496.89 --> 3507.89
a speaker I don't know to start out

3506.4 --> 3510.3
being a speaker

3507.89 --> 3512.2799999999997
maybe I just go to one of the

3510.3 --> 3514.73
conference's and actually meet a flat

3512.28 --> 3514.73
earther

3516.72 --> 3525.66
well you've usually got plenty to say

3518.94 --> 3528.75
I'm sure you could do ten minutes Oh God

3525.66 --> 3531.75
yeah even if it's just your story how

3528.75 --> 3533.88
you how you came about why you do you

3531.75 --> 3538.65
sure what you're in trouble maybe I

3533.88 --> 3541.98
could go on with my rectangular looping

3538.65 --> 3545.73
stuff or something definitely and it is

3541.98 --> 3547.68
kind of my thing so we're okay I could

3545.73 --> 3550.05
talk about that I guess do some

3547.68 --> 3554.64
explanations like oh the misconceptions

3550.05 --> 3556.6800000000003
and disk presumptions and yeah you know

3554.64 --> 3559.3199999999997
yeah sure sure I could do that no

3556.68 --> 3562.89
problem it's routine well you came up

3559.32 --> 3567.36
with the optical slant that was your

3562.89 --> 3572.67
idea wasn't it the optical slant is only

3567.36 --> 3575.4300000000003
for the phenomena as it is being

3572.67 --> 3578.73
perceived basically yeah but you said

3575.43 --> 3582.21
that at least six months before Antony

3578.73 --> 3584.88
came up with dirty air yeah there's been

3582.21 --> 3590.37
many different approaches to what it

3584.88 --> 3598.23
wasn't so you could talk about that your

3590.37 --> 3600.0299999999997
life is a Fe adventurer right okay yeah

3598.23 --> 3600.72
you can't be interesting people will be

3600.03 --> 3605.5800000000004
interested

3600.72 --> 3607.1299999999997
I did have an open question thing sure

3605.58 --> 3611.91
doing it

3607.13 --> 3614.6600000000003
plus you you would probably know a large

3611.91 --> 3616.71
percentage of the people there already

3614.66 --> 3619.29
if you look at home to being familiar

3616.71 --> 3625.8
with them yeah so there you go I think

3619.29 --> 3630.09
you should do it sure why not you should

3625.8 --> 3631.9500000000003
have a word with Tony he knows Roxanne I

3630.09 --> 3636.5
think Roxanne's one of the organizers

3631.95 --> 3636.5
which or part of the organization team

3639.29 --> 3645.84
cool and that'd be great you'd be part

3643.74 --> 3649.08
of the broadcast part of the thing I'm

3645.84 --> 3651.38
gonna meet loads of new people think

3649.08 --> 3653.54
I've just sold all your problems are

3651.38 --> 3656.2200000000003
[Laughter]

3653.54 --> 3657.62
math snob solved all my problems but it

3656.22 --> 3659.8199999999997
is something to look forward to

3657.62 --> 3665.91
especially if it's gonna be in the

3659.82 --> 3669.27
summer then I can I will be able to go

3665.91 --> 3674.99
by that time and I'm sure of it so yeah

3669.27 --> 3677.69
and yeah but for now I'm kind of still

3674.99 --> 3680.2099999999996
nervous about right now more like this

3677.69 --> 3682.04
period yeah I think you'll be alright

3680.21 --> 3683.96
you've been through it before and you've

3682.04 --> 3689.599
been through worse I think you'll be

3683.96 --> 3694.19
fine I know what how about the rest of

3689.599 --> 3694.579
the world well I'm sure I'll be fine as

3694.19 --> 3697.25
well

3694.579 --> 3700.79
I won't we do funny very you'll be fine

3697.25 --> 3706.66
as well but when we finally meet

3700.79 --> 3706.66
I'll buy you a drink what do you mean no

3708.7 --> 3712.54
you wouldn't have a drink with me

3714.4 --> 3721.42
no maybe Wow

3718.7 --> 3724.5789999999997
but I'd be extremely suspicious of you

3721.42 --> 3728.359
every single step of the way that's okay

3724.579 --> 3730.369
I'm fine without you nothing to do

3728.359 --> 3731.72
scared of yeah you're not gonna be

3730.369 --> 3736.2200000000003
bringing me a drink

3731.72 --> 3738.589
for example haha I'll let you pay a

3736.22 --> 3742.339
drink and I'll look as the bartender

3738.589 --> 3746.089
opens it up and hands it to me wow that

3742.339 --> 3751.25
paranoid yeah Wow yeah it happened

3746.089 --> 3754.4
before okay so I'll tell you what then

3751.25 --> 3759.29
Arwen what I'll do is I'll give you 20

3754.4 --> 3761.859
euros and you can go to the bar that's

3759.29 --> 3761.859
all right deal

3765.09 --> 3777.4700000000003
