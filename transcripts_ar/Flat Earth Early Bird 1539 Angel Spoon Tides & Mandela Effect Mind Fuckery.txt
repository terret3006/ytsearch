[Music]

139.5 --> 144.78

162.39 --> 170.89999999999998
[Music]

173.7 --> 183.41
it is Tuesday the 14th of March 2023

179.57 --> 183.41
[Music]

185.64 --> 192.83999999999997
temperature is 8 degrees Celsius

189.54 --> 195.98999999999998
yeah no more 17 degrees that was really

192.84 --> 197.159
nice though yesterday it was really nice

195.99 --> 199.8
[Music]

197.159 --> 201.84
went out for groceries and that it was

199.8 --> 205.519
just

201.84 --> 205.519
smooth smooth weather

208.49 --> 211.559
[Music]

211.739 --> 217.92000000000002
right but I am slightly wonky though I

214.739 --> 221.34
don't know what it was just the the wind

217.92 --> 223.55999999999997
constant wind kept me up at night it was

221.34 --> 225.78
kind of annoying

223.56 --> 229.519
so it was like real sudden pressure and

225.78 --> 229.519
all that so it startled me

229.6 --> 231.95
[Music]

231.06 --> 238.11
uh

231.95 --> 238.10999999999999
[Music]

238.739 --> 241.739
you don't feel super great

240.55 --> 244.37900000000002
[Music]

241.739 --> 247.62
combination of things I think like the

244.379 --> 250.85999999999999
way I ate yesterday was just not very

247.62 --> 254.0
good for me so I felt that at night and

250.86 --> 254.0
the wind kept me up

254.7 --> 260.09999999999997
also yeah man I watched old Benjamin

258.0 --> 262.26
show like a part of it

260.1 --> 264.18
from this Monday

262.26 --> 266.52
God

264.18 --> 268.8
that was like re that was kind of

266.52 --> 272.479
shocking

268.8 --> 272.479
well some of it I'd seen before

272.699 --> 277.759
but yeah I don't know I'm a little weird

275.46 --> 277.75899999999996
today

281.94 --> 286.88
I'll be all right though if somebody's

283.8 --> 286.88
gonna show up and chat

289.86 --> 306.44
that would be great

292.11 --> 310.06
[Music]

306.44 --> 316.68
a 4kc first in chat good to see you

310.06 --> 319.08
[Music]

316.68 --> 321.84000000000003
right so I'm just gonna take it easy in

319.08 --> 324.14
this first part and let's see if it gets

321.84 --> 335.76
rolling

324.14 --> 335.76
[Music]

338.17 --> 346.689
[Music]

363.06 --> 370.08
right but I mean definitely I mean

367.259 --> 372.47900000000004
not eating super great

370.08 --> 374.28
and then not sleeping well combination

372.479 --> 378.08
yeah

374.28 --> 378.08
doesn't really work all that great

379.8 --> 384.539
I mean it would have been worse if I if

382.259 --> 384.96000000000004
I had still been drinking beer which I

384.539 --> 388.02
don't

384.96 --> 388.02
[Music]

389.4 --> 394.5
I am noticing by the way like yeah man I

392.22 --> 396.78000000000003
really quit drinking I drank like beer

394.5 --> 399.78
every day for what is it three years

396.78 --> 399.78
more

400.68 --> 407.88
kind of lost count

402.15 --> 409.79999999999995
[Music]

407.88 --> 411.9
and now it's like yeah no I'm not

409.8 --> 413.22
drinking and it's like it's always been

411.9 --> 416.46
that so

413.22 --> 417.78000000000003
I'm really happy that about that

416.46 --> 442.46
is much healthier

417.78 --> 445.67999999999995
[Music]

442.46 --> 448.02
uh okay sorry Casey I wanted to get

445.68 --> 449.88
further into that I mean I thought it

448.02 --> 452.12
was pretty clear what I was talking

449.88 --> 452.12
about

454.86 --> 460.619
right there's no real paradoxes

457.55 --> 460.619
[Music]

461.099 --> 468.0
they only exist virtually

464.4 --> 469.85999999999996
and they're always there because

468.0 --> 473.819
the build up

469.86 --> 477.599
to such a conclusion has been wrong

473.819 --> 480.84000000000003
and you can either find other ways

477.599 --> 482.039
to explain things without it having a

480.84 --> 484.25899999999996
paradox

482.039 --> 487.25
you see and I did that I demonstrated

484.259 --> 490.319
that on the show yesterday Thor

487.25 --> 494.22
[Music]

490.319 --> 498.12
right so Paradox when it arrives it's

494.22 --> 500.16
it's kind of universally because

498.12 --> 502.56
your angle of approach was just wrong

500.16 --> 504.90000000000003
your build up

502.56 --> 508.639
what's wrong and then yeah Paradox might

504.9 --> 508.63899999999995
arrive because it's wrong

508.979 --> 514.5
the vantage point was wrong

511.62 --> 516.419
anyway yeah I'll take a two-minute break

514.5 --> 518.779
I'll be right back you think about that

516.419 --> 518.779
sure

524.67 --> 538.7099999999999
[Music]

536.22 --> 572.169

617.76 --> 619.9399999999999
thank you

624.46 --> 643.87
[Music]

652.16 --> 655.64

664.2 --> 669.629
Richard G good to see you

666.58 --> 669.629
[Music]

672.84 --> 698.36
[Music]

693.0 --> 698.36
man I'm just realizing also that I think

698.459 --> 703.3199999999999
there's just a tension building up

700.56 --> 705.7199999999999
because well tomorrow is going to be an

703.32 --> 709.019
election day here

705.72 --> 712.86
and there's a lot of

709.019 --> 714.3100000000001
hopes writing on it right now it's it's

712.86 --> 717.1800000000001
really tense I mean

714.31 --> 721.68
[Music]

717.18 --> 725.3389999999999
if this fails or it goes astray

721.68 --> 728.399
or something I mean we're really screwed

725.339 --> 732.44
the Netherlands like this is like a

728.399 --> 732.44
critical moment I can feel the tension

734.339 --> 739.33
maybe it's just me but I mean

737.64 --> 743.72
I'm really tense about it

739.33 --> 748.5600000000001
[Music]

743.72 --> 750.779
I mean I really hope this I mean if at

748.56 --> 753.06
this point you see just thinking like oh

750.779 --> 754.68
and we all vote and then everybody comes

753.06 --> 756.959
out and votes and

754.68 --> 759.899
and then we get the right guys and then

756.959 --> 761.9399999999999
it'll finally be over I mean that is

759.899 --> 764.7
kind of still a bit in the background of

761.94 --> 767.82
my head when I think about it but I mean

764.7 --> 770.36
is that realistic at this point

767.82 --> 770.36
foreign

772.98 --> 783.1800000000001
[Music]

779.1 --> 785.639
I am secretly suspecting that like the

783.18 --> 788.579
elections might Simply Be stolen

785.639 --> 790.92
kind of like well not as overtly as it

788.579 --> 794.0999999999999
was in the United States

790.92 --> 795.24
oh the ballot craziness and all that on

794.1 --> 797.839
camera

795.24 --> 797.839
but

801.18 --> 806.54
at this point the chances with how the

803.279 --> 806.54
government has been behaving

806.7 --> 812.22
people in power

809.16 --> 814.68
the likelihood of them doing trying to

812.22 --> 817.62
pull something off like that is very

814.68 --> 821.66
high in my opinion of course there will

817.62 --> 821.66
be people guarding against it but yeah

821.94 --> 826.3800000000001
tense

824.339 --> 829.7600000000001
and I didn't sleep very well and was

826.38 --> 829.76
really restless last night

831.0 --> 833.839
uh

836.459 --> 842.54
selection stone that yeah well they do

838.68 --> 842.54
actually they they still do matter

843.12 --> 849.72
right this is not like who is going to

845.399 --> 853.43
become president type of vote

849.72 --> 855.12
this is more about like Regional control

853.43 --> 856.68
[Music]

855.12 --> 859.66
provincial

856.68 --> 862.38
so it is actually important

859.66 --> 864.42
[Music]

862.38 --> 866.76
so I didn't give you yeah yeah well I

864.42 --> 868.74
will give consent to these people these

866.76 --> 871.56
specific people because of their actions

868.74 --> 873.899
and especially because of the lack of

871.56 --> 875.6999999999999
secret corrupt [ __ ] that goes against

873.899 --> 878.16
all their principles that they do in the

875.7 --> 880.32
background yeah I haven't caught them

878.16 --> 882.12
doing that at all

880.32 --> 884.339
and that is

882.12 --> 887.22
really hopeful because in the past when

884.339 --> 889.8000000000001
I trusted people turn out they were

887.22 --> 892.0790000000001
doing sneaky [ __ ] in the back and they

889.8 --> 893.279
corrupted

892.079 --> 895.5
then

893.279 --> 896.579
and I don't anticipate that from

895.5 --> 899.399
happening

896.579 --> 902.579
right now what it's going to turn into

899.399 --> 904.079
if they would get real power that's a

902.579 --> 905.88
whole new question

904.079 --> 908.519
and there's still a big chance that if

905.88 --> 911.22
they really get these guys

908.519 --> 913.38
get a better grip that there is going to

911.22 --> 916.26
be basically like

913.38 --> 919.019
big money power going to like knock on

916.26 --> 921.06
their door and like try to force them

919.019 --> 923.519
like oh if you don't cooperate like

921.06 --> 925.4399999999999
we'll screw over the entire country

923.519 --> 930.019
doing this and that

925.44 --> 930.019

Scrooge George Sanford

955.02 --> 961.92
[Music]

958.019 --> 964.26
a binary system well look

961.92 --> 969.24
in a way with all the multiple parties

964.26 --> 971.519
around there is a sort of binary system

969.24 --> 973.32
it's just these groups that go one way

971.519 --> 975.72
and there's the groups that go the

973.32 --> 978.1990000000001
opposite way and they naturally kind of

975.72 --> 978.1990000000001
cling together

979.199 --> 982.9799999999999
even though they are independent they're

981.3 --> 984.03
just aligned

982.98 --> 997.25

I mean in the United States yeah I mean

1166.22 --> 1171.14
the Republicans and the Democrats they

1168.679 --> 1173.96

1171.14 --> 1175.4
really conjoined twins I mean they're

1173.96 --> 1177.8600000000001
really like that

in the Netherlands these

1177.86 --> 1184.84

pressure without a container next to a

1498.08 --> 1504.26
gigantic vacuum that doesn't work either

1501.5 --> 1506.24
and oh if you think that they can be

1504.26 --> 1508.46
contained somehow by gravity well good

1506.24 --> 1511.1
luck with that because it can't gravity

1508.46 --> 1512.24
cannot be contained cannot be a

1511.1 --> 1514.82
container

1512.24 --> 1516.6200000000001
I mean I can think of it as a container

1514.82 --> 1519.9189999999999
pretty eloquently but that's not going

1516.62 --> 1522.4399999999998

each other and then they try to verbally

1627.14 --> 1633.8600000000001

1794.12 --> 1797.899
were so hilarious I just had to laugh at

it

1797.899 --> 1803.0
yeah

1799.159 --> 1806.44
I mean you think that saying tights

1803.0 --> 1806.44
is a globe argument

that is hysterical

what you think that the tides according

1815.059 --> 1820.539
to what has been explained about how the

1817.399 --> 1820.539
globe model works and the time

1821.44 --> 1828.14
really have you ever seen Neil deGrasse

1824.899 --> 1830.059
Tyson in like with a visual with the 3D

1828.14 --> 1832.279
animated demonstration on what that

1830.059 --> 1834.02
would actually look like how a giant

1832.279 --> 1837.919
bulge of water

1834.02 --> 1839.96
like Miller's planet from Interstellar

1837.919 --> 1841.3400000000001
how that would just go around being

1839.96 --> 1844.88
pulled up

1841.34 --> 1846.86
and drowning everything every 24 hours

1844.88 --> 1849.44
yeah yeah

1846.86 --> 1851.36
that's what he showed that that's what

1849.44 --> 1855.52
should be happening

1851.36 --> 1858.62
according to the tides model okay

1855.52 --> 1860.9189999999999
is that happening is that happening

1858.62 --> 1860.9189999999999
though

1861.26 --> 1865.779
no

1863.179 --> 1869.48
and there's places in the open ocean

1865.779 --> 1874.039
where there is no Tides next to other

1869.48 --> 1876.98
places where there is a tide yes explain

1874.039 --> 1880.399
it on the globe buddy

1876.98 --> 1883.1
why'd you explain that on a globe how

1880.399 --> 1886.039
the moon pulls a bit of water in one

1883.1 --> 1892.0
region but right beside it it doesn't do

1886.039 --> 1894.44
that yes yes oh it's logic

2036.399 --> 2040.9599999999998
is just a soccer counter of Sean Hawkins

2038.919 --> 2044.22

2040.96 --> 2044.22
Sean Hawkins doesn't he

2044.82 --> 2048.56

2088.32 --> 2096.7000000000003
[Music]

2094.54 --> 2099.4
you do want to know about the tides well

2096.7 --> 2101.3199999999997
tides are a very interesting thing and

2099.4 --> 2104.8
still kind of mysterious

2101.32 --> 2107.92
right I have my own explanation as to

2104.8 --> 2110.6800000000003
what I think tides are

2107.92 --> 2112.2400000000002
I think that they are mostly a magnetic

2110.68 --> 2114.8799999999997
phenomenon

2112.24 --> 2118.4799999999996
that are related to

2114.88 --> 2120.2200000000003
uh well metal in the ground Regional

2118.48 --> 2122.14
because it's like a regional thing it

2120.22 --> 2123.8799999999997
always comes back in that region that's

2122.14 --> 2125.74
where the tides are and it's usually

2123.88 --> 2126.94
metal

2125.74 --> 2129.4799999999996
rich

2126.94 --> 2129.48
Rock

2130.72 --> 2137.5
so and also it looks magnetic when you

2134.68 --> 2139.1189999999997
look at the tide map

2137.5 --> 2141.46
overview

2139.119 --> 2143.32
it looks magnetic it looks like

2141.46 --> 2144.339
something is being stirred there's like

2143.32 --> 2146.8590000000004
a

2144.339 --> 2147.82
a line and it just keeps stirring like

2146.859 --> 2151.24
that

2147.82 --> 2153.94
it looks like a magnetic spoon it

2151.24 --> 2156.8799999999997
reminded me of like

2153.94 --> 2160.7200000000003
like a stirring a magnetic stirring

2156.88 --> 2162.6400000000003
device like in a laboratory equipment

2160.72 --> 2165.4599999999996
and they have like a magnet and then a

2162.64 --> 2167.2599999999998
pill and it just keeps moving around

2165.46 --> 2169.119
it just reminded me of that so I was

2167.26 --> 2171.88
thinking like yeah this is like a spoon

2169.119 --> 2177.6600000000003
it's like a magnetic spoon somehow is

2171.88 --> 2177.6600000000003
just a flap just keeps rotating hmm

2177.88 --> 2183.94
and so I called it an angel spoon it's

2181.42 --> 2185.619
like an angel it's just stirring the

2183.94 --> 2188.68
water

2185.619 --> 2191.5
and then of course that's not literal

2188.68 --> 2193.4199999999996
it's like a symbolic

2191.5 --> 2196.06
description

2193.42 --> 2197.56
so I call what causes the tights Angel

2196.06 --> 2199.839
spoons

2197.56 --> 2202.18
yeah and then everybody can squirt over

2199.839 --> 2204.5789999999997
that because you go yeah how dare you oh

2202.18 --> 2207.3999999999996
how dare you call it an angel spoon yeah

2204.579 --> 2212.1400000000003
dude I don't know what the [ __ ] it is

2207.4 --> 2214.78
but it it reminds me of like somebody

2212.14 --> 2217.24
stirring their their tea

2214.78 --> 2219.82
from the top view

2217.24 --> 2221.68
the tight map so I'm just think yes just

2219.82 --> 2224.2000000000003
like Angel spoons they're just stirring

2221.68 --> 2225.46
the ocean and it's probably magnetic

2224.2 --> 2227.859
related

2225.46 --> 2230.02
because I mean it's salt water

2227.859 --> 2235.06
salt water is

2230.02 --> 2238.18
susceptible to Electric activity it is

2235.06 --> 2241.2599999999998
you can do electric things do things

2238.18 --> 2241.2599999999998
with salt water

2241.599 --> 2247.78
is just a fact

2243.7 --> 2249.5789999999997
right so there's something magnetic

2247.78 --> 2251.8590000000004
that is

2249.579 --> 2253.48
stirring

2251.859 --> 2256.06
the water

2253.48 --> 2258.339
and that's causing the tides in a very

2256.06 --> 2263.2599999999998
specific way I mean some places have

2258.339 --> 2266.74
Tides three times a day okay how the

2263.26 --> 2270.3390000000004
[ __ ] do you explain that okay you you

2266.74 --> 2272.3799999999997
explain that okay other than oh the

2270.339 --> 2275.0789999999997
angel spoons just stirring one and a

2272.38 --> 2278.04
half times as fast otherwise I'm like

2275.079 --> 2278.04
dude

2279.88 --> 2284.44
can you explain that

2282.16 --> 2288.0989999999997
where there's three tides in certain

2284.44 --> 2289.44
locations on Earth no probably nobody

2288.099 --> 2291.339
can really

2289.44 --> 2293.38
[Music]

2291.339 --> 2295.96
I mean it makes no sense in any kind of

2293.38 --> 2299.32
model idea about the tides or even like

2295.96 --> 2301.78
oh water gets sucked up in a big hole

2299.32 --> 2304.54
and then blow it out again

2301.78 --> 2306.52
that idea which by the way does not

2304.54 --> 2308.92
match

2306.52 --> 2310.839
the tide maps at all because you would

2308.92 --> 2313.42
see that you would see like oh there's a

2310.839 --> 2315.5789999999997
hole oh it's suddenly

2313.42 --> 2317.7400000000002
lesson there is something is sucking it

2315.579 --> 2319.1800000000003
up and then oh there's a bulge oh now

2317.74 --> 2320.74
it's getting up no that's not what it

2319.18 --> 2324.839
looks like that's not what a tide Maps

2320.74 --> 2324.839
look like the tide Maps look like a line

2325.06 --> 2329.22
that's going around

2327.52 --> 2331.599
not

2329.22 --> 2332.859
that's not what you're seeing on the

2331.599 --> 2334.78
tide map

2332.859 --> 2338.56
you see

2334.78 --> 2340.5400000000004
so yeah I've thought about these things

2338.56 --> 2341.92
all right yeah you get the [ __ ] out of

2340.54 --> 2343.45
here [ __ ]

2341.92 --> 2346.51
just piss off man

2343.45 --> 2346.5099999999998
[Music]

2346.96 --> 2350.7
that's your dumbass caps

2350.859 --> 2357.2999999999997
right so yeah that's my argument

2354.16 --> 2357.2999999999997
for the tides

2358.0 --> 2362.619
and the other one the star Trails I mean

2360.22 --> 2364.48
it's so embarrassing to keep hearing

2362.619 --> 2366.76
Ballers talk about that I'm not even

2364.48 --> 2368.38
gonna rebut that

2366.76 --> 2371.8590000000004
I mean

2368.38 --> 2374.9100000000003
just turn around 180 degrees

2371.859 --> 2378.02
that's usually the answer

2374.91 --> 2378.02
[Music]

2382.66 --> 2386.2799999999997
all right anyway let's move on

2387.31 --> 2391.15
[Music]

2392.26 --> 2397.5
it's okay odds

2396.339 --> 2400.5589999999997
whatever

2397.5 --> 2400.559
[Music]

2403.599 --> 2407.44
I mean the angel spoons are not at the

2406.0 --> 2410.98
Docks

2407.44 --> 2413.2000000000003
okay they are more

2410.98 --> 2416.079
in the ocean

2413.2 --> 2418.4199999999996
more they're not like at

2416.079 --> 2420.4
the beach that's not where that happened

2418.42 --> 2423.099
that's not where that specific stirring

2420.4 --> 2426.579
effect is happening it's happening

2423.099 --> 2429.42
where there's a thicker bulge of water

2426.579 --> 2433.5600000000004
that's where it starts happening not

2429.42 --> 2433.56
directly on top of the land

2435.16 --> 2442.0789999999997
although even maybe some region it kind

2438.28 --> 2442.079
of does but those are really weird then

2442.119 --> 2446.7400000000002
because like ah

2444.7 --> 2449.74
but from what I saw in the tight Maps

2446.74 --> 2454.359
usually the epicenter of an Angel spoon

2449.74 --> 2456.9399999999996
stirring is not directly at the coast it

2454.359 --> 2458.74
never is it's always slightly off the

2456.94 --> 2462.42
coast at least

2458.74 --> 2462.4199999999996
or deeper mid-ocean

2466.06 --> 2470.46
see if I can just show it tight Maps

2471.339 --> 2473.88
thank you

2477.3 --> 2486.46
[Music]

2484.119 --> 2489.599

2524.619 --> 2527.52
let's see

2528.15 --> 2534.329
[Music]

2534.82 --> 2540.52
yeah I'm trying this one this might work

2537.55 --> 2543.02
[Music]

2540.52 --> 2546.339
hello what the hell

2543.02 --> 2550.8
[Music]

2546.339 --> 2550.7999999999997
great yeah opening a new tab of course

2551.74 --> 2560.14
oh goody it's the NASA Channel

2554.75 --> 2562.42
[Music]

2560.14 --> 2567.1189999999997
let's see if it's the original thing or

2562.42 --> 2567.119
if it's just some nonsense [ __ ]

2568.85 --> 2576.8199999999997
[Music]

2573.4 --> 2579.2200000000003
okay yeah yeah now this does show it

2576.82 --> 2581.56
this does actually show the circular

2579.22 --> 2584.859
movement

2581.56 --> 2586.7799999999997
although it's shown different now like

2584.859 --> 2590.0789999999997
it's not as distinct

2586.78 --> 2592.42
but I mean this animation from the NASA

2590.079 --> 2594.52
channel does actually just kind of show

2592.42 --> 2597.16
what I'm talking about it really does

2594.52 --> 2600.7599999999998
look it's getting stirred

2597.16 --> 2603.25
you see it's just

2600.76 --> 2615.5200000000004
stirring

2603.25 --> 2620.16
[Music]

2615.52 --> 2620.16
the star drill thing you can explain it

2620.38 --> 2625.96
oh really

2622.839 --> 2628.42
oh let me guess oh if the Earth is a

2625.96 --> 2631.9
disc then how does it make sense that

2628.42 --> 2635.26
the south is 360 degrees Yeah because

2631.9 --> 2637.06
the Earth is not a disc

2635.26 --> 2639.46
duh

2637.06 --> 2640.599
I mean if South is south and north is

2639.46 --> 2642.34
north

2640.599 --> 2646.119
there is no issue at all

2642.34 --> 2649.359
[Music]

2646.119 --> 2652.7200000000003
it's not a disc it's rectangle yeah you

2649.359 --> 2654.5789999999997
have no issues with like logically you

2652.72 --> 2657.4599999999996
have no issues

2654.579 --> 2660.28
with how the stars are showing

2657.46 --> 2662.98
if it's just rectangular

2660.28 --> 2665.26
and South is always South and North is

2662.98 --> 2666.76
always north always the same euclidean

2665.26 --> 2669.579
direction

2666.76 --> 2674.6800000000003
yeah no issues whatsoever

2669.579 --> 2674.6800000000003
I mean this was an answer I had in 2016.

2674.8 --> 2679.78
yeah

2676.72 --> 2681.4599999999996
that's why I don't like disc reifying

2679.78 --> 2683.03
flat earthers

2681.46 --> 2689.8
because they're wrong

2683.03 --> 2691.42
[Music]

2689.8 --> 2692.8590000000004
no that wasn't what you're gonna say oh

2691.42 --> 2695.56
well whatever then

2692.859 --> 2699.409
don't say anything then

2695.56 --> 2699.409
[Music]

2702.6 --> 2720.94

2718.42 --> 2722.6800000000003

2720.94 --> 2724.9
ages since I went on any kind of

2722.68 --> 2726.819
vacation I could use that too I mean

2724.9 --> 2728.92
I've been haven't been on vacation for

2726.819 --> 2730.619
over a decade

2728.92 --> 2734.16

2785.68 --> 2789.94

2788.38 --> 2792.04
Spain again

2789.94 --> 2793.2400000000002
to where I used to go on vacation all

2792.04 --> 2796.859
the time

2793.24 --> 2796.859
I'm gonna just go there alone

2797.06 --> 2802.7599999999998
[Music]

2805.66 --> 2807.839
thank you

2815.64 --> 2821.2
on the other hand I mean do I really

2818.56 --> 2822.5789999999997
even need to go to another country like

2821.2 --> 2825.3999999999996
during the summer

2822.579 --> 2829.0
the Summers here have been great

2825.4 --> 2831.099
I mean like in the 90s and the 80s it

2829.0 --> 2834.7
was like yeah the weather here typically

2831.099 --> 2836.6800000000003
sucked during summer so we like fled to

2834.7 --> 2839.7999999999997
Spain where it was super sunny and hot

2836.68 --> 2842.0789999999997
because it was usually just raining a

2839.8 --> 2844.6600000000003
lot in the Netherlands well that's not

2842.079 --> 2846.099
really been happening in the last 10

2844.66 --> 2847.8999999999996
years

2846.099 --> 2849.579
it really hasn't

2847.9 --> 2851.7400000000002
so

2849.579 --> 2855.2400000000002
I mean the Summers here are great

2851.74 --> 2855.24
they're very enjoyable

2855.819 --> 2859.859
and even like really hot

2860.619 --> 2866.02
which like in the 90s was rare

2863.79 --> 2868.359
[Music]

2866.02 --> 2871.859
maybe like a week of that and then would

2868.359 --> 2871.859
just be rain again

2872.56 --> 2875.16
anyway

2890.319 --> 2895.2
right okay even like were you gonna say

2892.9 --> 2895.2000000000003
anything

2896.079 --> 2901.0
was anybody going to attempt to still

2898.18 --> 2903.16
reassert that maybe the Earth is a globe

2901.0 --> 2905.56
after all after everything that I I just

2903.16 --> 2907.0
roll out with that numpty dip [ __ ] and

2905.56 --> 2909.94
who had to get banned because he was

2907.0 --> 2912.339
only complaining about

2909.94 --> 2914.64
me not debating him while I was debating

2912.339 --> 2914.64
him

2920.26 --> 2924.3390000000004
warm enough to go swim in the channel

2922.54 --> 2927.339
during summer

2924.339 --> 2930.94
when it's actually warm yeah

2927.339 --> 2933.64
dude like even last summer there's like

2930.94 --> 2935.68
there's this there's boats there and

2933.64 --> 2938.2599999999998
some people actually live there and just

2935.68 --> 2941.56
like there were kids diving from boats

2938.26 --> 2944.76
in the water there all the time

2941.56 --> 2944.7599999999998
because it was really hot

2948.76 --> 2955.48
it's also logically because

2952.0 --> 2958.42
really hot here in the Netherlands is

2955.48 --> 2960.819
less hot than for example in mid-spain

2958.42 --> 2963.579
why because there's more moist here

2960.819 --> 2965.8
there's water everywhere so when it gets

2963.579 --> 2967.599
really hot it also

2965.8 --> 2969.3500000000004
there's a lot of moist it makes it more

2967.599 --> 2970.9
hot

2969.35 --> 2973.72
[Music]

2970.9 --> 2974.8
typically right we don't have dry heat

2973.72 --> 2976.9599999999996
here

2974.8 --> 2981.3390000000004
if it's gonna get hot then it's also

2976.96 --> 2984.52
gonna be moist on

2981.339 --> 2985.77
and that yeah that typically makes it

2984.52 --> 2988.359
seem warmer

2985.77 --> 2990.579
[Music]

2988.359 --> 2992.92
and the need to cool off will be higher

2990.579 --> 2995.44
even though the temperature isn't like

2992.92 --> 2997.96
really like as high as it would be in

2995.44 --> 2999.7000000000003
summer in Texas or something right not

2997.96 --> 3001.46
even close

2999.7 --> 3002.64
humid yeah because of the humidity

3001.46 --> 3003.78
[Music]

3002.64 --> 3006.54
so

3003.78 --> 3007.98
when it's like 30 degrees here that's

3006.54 --> 3010.859
freaking hot

3007.98 --> 3014.339
30 degrees Celsius

3010.859 --> 3014.74
that's really hot because there's moist

3014.339 --> 3020.04
everywhere

3014.74 --> 3022.22
[Music]

3020.04 --> 3022.22

3103.859 --> 3106.819
like you're in an oven

3107.94 --> 3113.339
I mean 43 when it's dry is freaking hot

3111.119 --> 3115.76
enough but when it's humid that's really

3113.339 --> 3115.7599999999998

like

3131.38 --> 3135.7200000000003
[Music]

3132.78 --> 3138.119
take my computer and everything

3135.72 --> 3141.4199999999996
in a backpack

3138.119 --> 3143.7000000000003
or in some Bust or something like what

3141.42 --> 3145.7400000000002
you guys have an extensive imagination

3143.7 --> 3146.71
but I mean that's not just not gonna

[Music]

3209.16 --> 3214.92
yeah but in look guys I am not a no bad

3213.96 --> 3217.8
type

3214.92 --> 3218.84
I am like quite the opposite of a nomad

3217.8 --> 3224.6400000000003
type

3218.84 --> 3228.859
[Music]

3224.64 --> 3232.0789999999997
like I feel really uncomfortable

3228.859 --> 3236.04
continually traveling like literally it

3232.079 --> 3238.5
makes me feel sick I I just want it's

3236.04 --> 3240.66
like when we had to travel even on

3238.5 --> 3242.819
vacation to Spain through in the car

3240.66 --> 3245.04
which took like a whole day

3242.819 --> 3247.74
I would just like not

3245.04 --> 3250.02
I would try to just like get my mind of

3247.74 --> 3252.66
it play games video games or something

3250.02 --> 3254.7
or board games

3252.66 --> 3257.3999999999996
because I just really didn't like it I

3254.7 --> 3260.0989999999997
don't like I want to be at a place and

3257.4 --> 3262.2000000000003
then make it my home and stay there as

3260.099 --> 3263.76
much as I can you that's typically what

3262.2 --> 3265.859
I do

3263.76 --> 3268.9500000000003
I'm a home guy

3265.859 --> 3271.5589999999997
I'm not a nomad at all

3268.95 --> 3275.22
[Music]

3271.559 --> 3276.77
like I lose myself if I don't have some

3275.22 --> 3291.4199999999996
kind of a home turf

3276.77 --> 3293.7599999999998
[Music]

3291.42 --> 3295.099
you're a Wanderer okay

3293.76 --> 3298.5200000000004
fine

3295.099 --> 3301.92
there's other types that do like that

3298.52 --> 3303.359
that really hate being stuck up in one

3301.92 --> 3307.64
place all the time and they think it's

3303.359 --> 3307.64
prison yeah I think the opposite

3316.619 --> 3322.98
going off alone well look if it's like

3320.88 --> 3326.1600000000003
exploring someplace

3322.98 --> 3328.619
sure I'll go off alone but that's like

3326.16 --> 3329.7599999999998
territorial it's like what is in the

3328.619 --> 3332.099
territory

3329.76 --> 3334.3190000000004
surrounding my direct territory that's

3332.099 --> 3336.54
called exploration yeah I love that I

3334.319 --> 3338.94
love that kind of wondering what I don't

3336.54 --> 3340.859
like is keep on wondering keep on

3338.94 --> 3342.18
wondering more and more and more and

3340.859 --> 3345.0
more until you don't know where the [ __ ]

3342.18 --> 3347.4199999999996
you are anymore yeah that's what I don't

3345.0 --> 3351.059
like at all

3347.42 --> 3352.92
what I like to explore surrounding

3351.059 --> 3355.46
territory

3352.92 --> 3355.46
sure

3356.64 --> 3362.42
I know I don't like just keep moving I

3359.7 --> 3362.4199999999996
just don't like it

3365.92 --> 3368.969
[Music]

3371.37 --> 3397.8489999999997
[Music]

3398.28 --> 3404.2200000000003
right so yeah I get it there's people

3401.7 --> 3406.0789999999997
Like Richard G probably and they're like

3404.22 --> 3408.839
oh finally

3406.079 --> 3411.9
on vacation away from home and he'll be

3408.839 --> 3413.819
like yeah out there and like the first

3411.9 --> 3414.78
few days he's gonna be like yeah I'm

3413.819 --> 3417.24
free

3414.78 --> 3419.3390000000004
right with me it's exactly the opposite

3417.24 --> 3421.9799999999996
when do we have to go on vacation the

3419.339 --> 3423.9
first few days I feel like this is not

3421.98 --> 3424.92
home everything is different I don't

3423.9 --> 3427.6800000000003
like it

3424.92 --> 3430.44
and then I have to get used to it first

3427.68 --> 3433.5789999999997
and then after a few days I'm like oh

3430.44 --> 3435.9
yeah I get it now I'm I'm now it's home

3433.579 --> 3438.9
temporary yeah

3435.9 --> 3440.099
so I'm the exact op I need some time to

3438.9 --> 3442.44
adjust

3440.099 --> 3445.02
like that was even a bit of an issue at

3442.44 --> 3447.7200000000003
the Amsterdam conference because it it's

3445.02 --> 3451.2599999999998
basically two days

3447.72 --> 3454.68
but that makes me really nervous and

3451.26 --> 3456.9
uptight it just makes me uncomfortable

3454.68 --> 3459.4199999999996
if I don't have some time to get used to

3456.9 --> 3462.359
it I mean it was even a bit of an issue

3459.42 --> 3464.64
at the wave Gothic traffon with my

3462.359 --> 3467.839
ex-girlfriend which was like that's

3464.64 --> 3467.839
three days in a row

3469.68 --> 3475.02
festivals because it's so short I just

3473.099 --> 3477.2400000000002
and it's like another place and then

3475.02 --> 3479.22
we're like camping or

3477.24 --> 3481.4399999999996
in a hotel somewhere and it's all just

3479.22 --> 3484.0789999999997
like a new place that I don't know and I

3481.44 --> 3486.2400000000002
could get lost and I don't like that

3484.079 --> 3489.2400000000002
right

3486.24 --> 3491.9399999999996
I need some time to settle in before I

3489.24 --> 3499.2
can really enjoy something

3491.94 --> 3501.48
[Music]

3499.2 --> 3504.5989999999997
but I can imagine that Richard G indeed

3501.48 --> 3507.18
would be like he would be like as soon

3504.599 --> 3509.4
as he's he's out he's like I'm free yeah

3507.18 --> 3513.2599999999998
I can just be free

3509.4 --> 3513.26
that doesn't work with me like that

3515.46 --> 3521.099
then again sitting here all the time I

3519.119 --> 3523.339
absolutely don't feel like I'm in a

3521.099 --> 3523.339
prison

3524.64 --> 3529.2599999999998
even though it's kind of small I guess

3526.98 --> 3531.08
and all that but there's this thing I

3529.26 --> 3533.2200000000003
got used to it

3531.08 --> 3535.64
[Music]

3533.22 --> 3535.64
and

3535.68 --> 3539.3999999999996
I'm connecting more with like the other

3537.66 --> 3541.5
roommates and all that because of it

3539.4 --> 3543.7200000000003
it's like oh I don't have all that room

3541.5 --> 3545.52
for myself well then I just have to

3543.72 --> 3548.22
share that

3545.52 --> 3550.44
the room without it yep

3548.22 --> 3552.4399999999996
hello

3550.44 --> 3552.44
hello

3552.859 --> 3556.0989999999997
look at that

3564.54 --> 3571.859
oh it was a jackdaw was like sitting

3568.559 --> 3575.3590000000004
with this with this chest like on the on

3571.859 --> 3575.359
the roof it looked really silly

3580.38 --> 3586.04
birds are gathering there now for some

3582.48 --> 3586.04
reason I don't know why

3591.29 --> 3596.72
[Music]

3592.98 --> 3596.72
every day oh Jesus

3597.42 --> 3603.04

3600.059 --> 3606.9
that's all that's really all I need

3603.04 --> 3606.9
[Music]

3607.2 --> 3613.02
and like a shower every week well unless

3611.339 --> 3614.94
I'm like going to be really active and

3613.02 --> 3616.5
like to the beach and all that and then

3614.94 --> 3618.299
yeah I'm probably gonna need more

3616.5 --> 3620.3
showers

3618.299 --> 3622.319
but yeah

3620.3 --> 3625.01
[Music]

3622.319 --> 3628.089
truck stop showers yeah yeah

3625.01 --> 3628.0890000000004
[Music]

3636.72 --> 3648.48
[Music]

3646.38 --> 3650.7000000000003
funniest part is the water is not clean

3648.48 --> 3652.98
well that all depends on where you are

3650.7 --> 3654.7799999999997
at George Sanford

3652.98 --> 3655.52
different regions have different water

3654.78 --> 3657.299
quality

3655.52 --> 3659.16
[Music]

3657.299 --> 3661.619
I mean I'm pretty sure that like water

3659.16 --> 3664.2599999999998
quality for example in Germany and the

3661.619 --> 3666.7200000000003
Netherlands is really great like from

3664.26 --> 3667.92
every tap but if you for example go to

3666.72 --> 3670.4399999999996
Spain

3667.92 --> 3672.839
water quality is not great

3670.44 --> 3674.7000000000003
they like typically put chlorine in

3672.839 --> 3678.96
there

3674.7 --> 3680.7
right and so with big parts of France

3678.96 --> 3684.299
I don't know maybe that's a change but

3680.7 --> 3686.3999999999996
that's been like that when I was younger

3684.299 --> 3689.18
so it all depends on the region what the

3686.4 --> 3689.1800000000003
water quality is

3695.43 --> 3698.5099999999998
[Music]

3705.839 --> 3708.02
thank you

3742.43 --> 3756.54
[Music]

3753.78 --> 3759.1800000000003
okay Richard G

3756.54 --> 3762.359
oh look the water quality here is really

3759.18 --> 3764.8999999999996
good but I still use ceramic water

3762.359 --> 3764.9
filters

3765.119 --> 3771.2400000000002
because there is still just like

3768.18 --> 3773.8799999999997
junk remnants

3771.24 --> 3774.8999999999996
and that Browns up the filters literally

3773.88 --> 3777.119
so

3774.9 --> 3779.04
that way the water is just cleaner and

3777.119 --> 3780.839
the filters last very long because the

3779.04 --> 3782.7599999999998
water is not that dirty really

3780.839 --> 3784.74
compared to other countries other

3782.76 --> 3787.3190000000004
regions

3784.74 --> 3789.4199999999996
I mean there's like other cities which

3787.319 --> 3792.0589999999997
water the water quality is much less

3789.42 --> 3793.44
like the water quality here in Utrecht

3792.059 --> 3797.28
is great

3793.44 --> 3799.799
but the water quarterly quality in like

3797.28 --> 3804.38
Rotterdam or Den Hague

3799.799 --> 3804.38
or Amsterdam not so great

3816.76 --> 3826.869
[Music]

3828.66 --> 3832.339
used to drink from the hose

3836.33 --> 3844.15
[Music]

3840.66 --> 3853.0789999999997
hey Amanda young good to see you

3844.15 --> 3855.96
[Music]

3853.079 --> 3859.44
right but yeah when why do I care that

3855.96 --> 3863.52
much well for me it's a big difference

3859.44 --> 3864.599
I mean I can like help bubbly taste the

3863.52 --> 3867.66
difference

3864.599 --> 3871.02
between water from the tap

3867.66 --> 3873.66
here and water that's gone through my

3871.02 --> 3876.18
ceramic filter it's a palpable

3873.66 --> 3877.2599999999998
difference especially when you cook the

3876.18 --> 3880.0789999999997
water

3877.26 --> 3882.2990000000004
it's really different

3880.079 --> 3887.48
tastes different

3882.299 --> 3887.48
feels different when you drank it so

3888.42 --> 3892.46
no Nathan today what are you talking

3890.28 --> 3892.46
about

3894.24 --> 3899.22

3924.96 --> 3928.559
big difference in my coffee after big

3926.76 --> 3930.119
Berkey Water freely yeah yeah well

3928.559 --> 3931.38
that's what I use big Berkeley water

3930.119 --> 3934.02
filter but I

3931.38 --> 3936.839
I use ceramic filters not the big Berkey

3934.02 --> 3938.85
filters those carbon filters those don't

3936.839 --> 3941.16
last very long

3938.85 --> 3943.68
[Music]

3941.16 --> 3947.339
my ceramic filters however

3943.68 --> 3949.04
they've been lasting roughly 10 years

3947.339 --> 3956.02
and they're still usable

3949.04 --> 3956.02
[Music]

3959.579 --> 3962.7200000000003
you forgot okay

3962.88 --> 3967.619
so you thought you'd show up 15 minutes

3965.46 --> 3971.46
after my show would normally end

3967.619 --> 3971.46

just

4011.66 --> 4019.5789999999997
all those clouds just went away

4016.52 --> 4022.22
I've I am like really surprised

4019.579 --> 4024.92
sometimes like how the sky just

4022.22 --> 4027.02
transforms like that

4024.92 --> 4030.14
am I right I mean the clouds were not

4027.02 --> 4032.359
moving around remember

4030.14 --> 4035.24
you could just compare this shot to the

4032.359 --> 4038.02
shot that I did earlier in the show

4035.24 --> 4040.819
and you just see like yeah it's

4038.02 --> 4043.94
completely different looking

4040.819 --> 4045.68
yet there's not really a lot happening

4043.94 --> 4047.48
up there

4045.68 --> 4050.8599999999997
so

4047.48 --> 4055.64
how can it just transform like that

4050.86 --> 4058.1600000000003
[Music]

4055.64 --> 4059.359
and that you you can't really even see

4058.16 --> 4062.7799999999997
it

4059.359 --> 4066.5589999999997
yeah but it's pretty beautiful out there

4062.78 --> 4068.8900000000003

you gonna get snow in the middle of

summer that's my question

in California

4110.779 --> 4114.4400000000005
that it actually snowed in California

4112.819 --> 4117.02
that's like

4114.44 --> 4119.139999999999
hasn't happened in like 200 years or

4117.02 --> 4119.14
something

I know there was like this giant flood

4151.04 --> 4155.12
recently

4153.02 --> 4157.31

4157.31 --> 4161.359
[Music]

4158.96 --> 4162.859
I think it was storm season in Autumn

4161.359 --> 4164.6
last year right

4162.859 --> 4166.58
but yeah I just do remember there was

4164.6 --> 4168.02
all the massive amounts of rains and all

4166.58 --> 4169.8189999999995
these floods

4168.02 --> 4172.46
I think your guys are still probably

4169.819 --> 4175.04
like rebuilding

4172.46 --> 4179.9800000000005
from that because entire Villages were

4175.04 --> 4179.98
all just Swept Away flooded to all hell

4222.08 --> 4228.739
at work eating plain yogurt

4225.08 --> 4231.739

yeah I heard that

4302.42 --> 4307.46
because is it really bad I mean it was

4304.76 --> 4310.84
the damage extensive or

4307.46 --> 4310.84
did most of it recover

4313.13 --> 4321.679

4318.739 --> 4323.299999999999
because yeah oranges do not like frost I

[Music]

4325.219 --> 4331.159
orange trees don't either they're really

4348.5 --> 4353.98
unfortunately

4350.84 --> 4353.9800000000005

4396.8 --> 4400.659000000001
the floor it is warmer than California

4401.719 --> 4405.44
yeah but that's because it's just more

4403.34 --> 4410.4800000000005
Oceanic isn't it

4405.44 --> 4413.259999999999
I mean California is not like a

4410.48 --> 4415.58
we call they

4413.26 --> 4418.820000000001
[Music]

4415.58 --> 4421.94
it's not bordering ocean as much

4418.82 --> 4424.639999999999
California that is although yeah the uh

4421.94 --> 4426.139999999999
there is that little

4424.64 --> 4428.3
part

4426.14 --> 4431.3
that does kind of stick in the ocean but

4428.3 --> 4434.719
I mean California is also a lot of

4431.3 --> 4435.7390000000005
inward land and mountain and Forest and

4434.719 --> 4439.1
all that

4435.739 --> 4442.04
Florida is really just riverlands

4439.1 --> 4443.02
and swamps

4442.04 --> 4445.76
right

4443.02 --> 4448.6990000000005
[Music]

4445.76 --> 4452.08
and is more south yeah effectively it

4448.699 --> 4452.08
sticks out more to the South

4456.98 --> 4461.48
right but it's because it's surrounded

4459.02 --> 4463.580000000001
by ocean everywhere it's kind of like

4461.48 --> 4467.178999999999
the Netherlands too I mean Nelson's not

4463.58 --> 4468.739
super warm but it's like Riverland and

4467.179 --> 4471.5
it's surrounded by a lot of ocean

4468.739 --> 4475.28
surface and when that happens

4471.5 --> 4478.699
then the temperature averages out more

4475.28 --> 4481.219
so like ocean climate more than if you

4478.699 --> 4483.5599999999995
have a really big chunk of land that's

4481.219 --> 4486.8
away from the ocean because then the

4483.56 --> 4488.79
winters become more cold and Summers can

4486.8 --> 4490.78
potentially become more hot

4488.79 --> 4493.5199999999995
[Music]

4490.78 --> 4495.739
around the ocean the temperature is

4493.52 --> 4498.26
going to be more average and if it's in

4495.739 --> 4499.419999999999
a hot region like very close to the

4498.26 --> 4503.06
equator

4499.42 --> 4506.54
then it's gonna be an average hotter

4503.06 --> 4506.54
region right

4509.42 --> 4512.9800000000005
the islands are cute yeah yeah

4515.6 --> 4521.179
right or Indonesia I mean Indonesia is

4518.96 --> 4523.28
like all kinds of thin islands and all

4521.179 --> 4525.86
that now it's a big island called Bali

4523.28 --> 4528.679
on top of that but like Java and all

4525.86 --> 4531.62
that those are like pretty slim Islands

4528.679 --> 4534.679
in a very hot region

4531.62 --> 4536.3
surrounded by ocean and so it's

4534.679 --> 4538.6990000000005
moist

4536.3 --> 4539.400000000001
and warm and pretty stable in its

4538.699 --> 4544.8189999999995
temperature

4539.4 --> 4544.8189999999995
[Music]

4545.84 --> 4551.54
with some occasional storms and

4549.5 --> 4552.69

4551.54 --> 4555.74
that too

4552.69 --> 4555.74
[Music]

4562.28 --> 4565.94
in that sense by the way you could

4563.96 --> 4567.92
almost say that Florida is kind of like

4565.94 --> 4569.96
an island

4567.92 --> 4572.2390000000005
that's still stuck to the mainland

4569.96 --> 4576.46
because it is really like

4572.239 --> 4576.459999999999
typically more an island climate

4588.32 --> 4590.62
foreign

4592.68 --> 4595.759

4598.36 --> 4604.639999999999
by the way by these types of things and

4600.92 --> 4607.28
knowing that because well I'm a

4604.64 --> 4609.38
a game master and sometimes like you

4607.28 --> 4611.659
have to if you're gonna like conjure up

4609.38 --> 4614.78
some land out of nothing

4611.659 --> 4618.08
it's got to be somewhat realistic

4614.78 --> 4622.34
right so I'm very interested in like why

4618.08 --> 4626.0
is the Land There the way it is what is

4622.34 --> 4629.32
it like why is it like that

4626.0 --> 4629.32
I think about those things

4635.0 --> 4639.69
what what are you talking about Thor

heard I don't I still don't know if it's

4701.54 --> 4707.719
still legitimate or anything that the

4704.239 --> 4711.139999999999
number Pi actually changed somehow

4707.719 --> 4713.179
a while ago there was an alleged Mandela

4711.14 --> 4714.88
effect surrounding it

4713.179 --> 4716.78
and I've never really been

4714.88 --> 4719.6
[Music]

4716.78 --> 4725.0
like clarifying it too much

4719.6 --> 4725.0
because I remember Pi being 3.1428

4725.36 --> 4727.96
I think

4732.62 --> 4739.099999999999
eight five nine I don't know it might be

4735.56 --> 4742.360000000001
all off but for some reason it's

4739.1 --> 4742.360000000001
dramatically changed

4744.14 --> 4749.360000000001
unless somebody was just really [ __ ]

4747.02 --> 4752.7390000000005
with everybody

4749.36 --> 4752.739
do any of you remember that

4753.86 --> 4758.179
it was a few years ago there's some

4756.5 --> 4760.219
there was just some item out there like

4758.179 --> 4763.84
the number changed

4760.219 --> 4763.84
one four one five

4767.14 --> 4771.14
four two

4772.82 --> 4775.36
really

4776.76 --> 4785.2390000000005
[Music]

4780.62 --> 4787.46
well the thing was I learned pie

4785.239 --> 4789.139999999999
by IX is one of the few things I

4787.46 --> 4791.9
actually memorized when I was younger

4789.14 --> 4793.64
and then it had like a certain set of

4791.9 --> 4798.199
numbers and it was really good at that I

4793.64 --> 4800.54
I remembered like eight digits perfectly

4798.199 --> 4802.639999999999
but I've forgotten that since and then

4800.54 --> 4803.78
it was just really weird to hear like it

4802.64 --> 4806.4800000000005
changed

4803.78 --> 4810.98
because no I just don't remember exactly

4806.48 --> 4813.08
how I memorized it before this

4810.98 --> 4815.36
so now it's just like what the [ __ ] is

4813.08 --> 4818.42
going on with this pie number like how

4815.36 --> 4821.38
the hell is that changing

4818.42 --> 4821.38
I don't get it

4823.04 --> 4830.84
I just thought it was 3.14

4827.12 --> 4836.08
2 8 5 9.

4830.84 --> 4836.08
something but I might be completely off

4852.62 --> 4862.4
one four one five nine was wow yeah

4858.38 --> 4865.88
one four one five nine two

4862.4 --> 4868.839999999999
I I switched the two and a one

4865.88 --> 4868.84
one four one

4869.6 --> 4875.620000000001
nine two yeah the rest I don't remember

4873.5 --> 4875.62
um

4887.719 --> 4893.84
okay George Sanford whatever

4890.12 --> 4896.0
I just remembered that that it just it

4893.84 --> 4899.179
was an item how it supposedly changed

4896.0 --> 4902.26
and it was like really like why like

4899.179 --> 4902.26
that makes no sense

4902.38 --> 4907.9400000000005
why would it change how could it change

4906.08 --> 4910.179
how could that make sense that it would

4907.94 --> 4910.178999999999
change

4911.54 --> 4915.739
and it wasn't like oh it's always been

4913.64 --> 4917.84
this no it was just like an official

4915.739 --> 4919.759999999999
thing like no it's actually a different

4917.84 --> 4923.179
number

4919.76 --> 4926.06
in a sense like oh it was wrong

4923.179 --> 4930.52
the original was wrong or something it

4926.06 --> 4930.52
was so weird when I first saw that

4941.6 --> 4945.820000000001
it can't change yeah that's what I

4943.699 --> 4945.82
thought

4951.43 --> 4957.08
[Music]

4953.54 --> 4959.12
yeah I wasn't talking about rounding up

4957.08 --> 4961.219
or down numbers

4959.12 --> 4963.92
talking about that the number the

4961.219 --> 4965.78
sequence would be different

4963.92 --> 4968.6
there was a whole thing out there it

4965.78 --> 4970.759999999999
might be just a giant [ __ ] with your

4968.6 --> 4973.34
mind campaign though I mean it's

4970.76 --> 4974.6
happened before oh look at this new

4973.34 --> 4976.219
thing happening it's gonna change

4974.6 --> 4978.7390000000005
everything in the next day it's like oh

4976.219 --> 4981.62
no nothing happened no no what do you

4978.739 --> 4983.36
mean article something happened no no

4981.62 --> 4984.32
nothing happened this just never

4983.36 --> 4988.099999999999
happened

4984.32 --> 4990.259999999999
right so there's been weird [ __ ] [ __ ]

4988.1 --> 4992.900000000001
with your mind thing items

4990.26 --> 4994.820000000001
that have been rolling out

4992.9 --> 4998.839999999999
in the last decade

4994.82 --> 5001.0599999999995
and that that might be one of them

4998.84 --> 5002.7390000000005
that it just bumped into it and they

5001.06 --> 5005.080000000001
just talked about oh it's different now

5002.739 --> 5007.419999999999
oh a little um probably some Mandela

5005.08 --> 5009.219
effect proponent

5007.42 --> 5012.6
and that it's gonna turn out to be

5009.219 --> 5012.6
complete horseshit

5013.37 --> 5017.21
[Music]

5018.46 --> 5022.84
that's like something out of 90 84. yeah

5020.98 --> 5025.0599999999995
Welcome to the Real World Richard G

5022.84 --> 5028.3
that's this world

5025.06 --> 5030.04
where complete horror [ __ ] items are

5028.3 --> 5032.14
just rolled out

5030.04 --> 5034.179
impromptu

5032.14 --> 5035.4400000000005
and then forgot about like it never

5034.179 --> 5038.26
happened

5035.44 --> 5040.299999999999
it's to break people's mind to plant

5038.26 --> 5041.7390000000005
false memories and then act like it

5040.3 --> 5043.3
never happened it's

5041.739 --> 5044.739
yeah

5043.3 --> 5047.320000000001
that's happened

5044.739 --> 5049.718999999999
that has happened to the public people

5047.32 --> 5052.719
do that

5049.719 --> 5053.9800000000005
like entire corporations sometimes do

5052.719 --> 5057.36
that

5053.98 --> 5057.36
it's part of what they do

5068.32 --> 5071.5599999999995
a 3.142

5071.98 --> 5079.08
right

5074.02 --> 5079.080000000001
now that's how I got the 142 then

5080.92 --> 5083.82
makes sense

5095.82 --> 5100.54
rich people do weird stuff for

5097.96 --> 5104.38
entertainment yeah they like to

5100.54 --> 5108.34
to mentally whip the flock

5104.38 --> 5111.04
to keep essays as I said right keep your

5108.34 --> 5114.400000000001
underlings [ __ ] so that everything

5111.04 --> 5118.56
stays predictable and you can

5114.4 --> 5118.5599999999995
have an edge over all of it

5118.84 --> 5123.1
so I think that they do it literally

5120.76 --> 5125.4400000000005
rolling out deranged [ __ ] just to

5123.1 --> 5127.179
confuse everybody up to make people lose

5125.44 --> 5129.58
track of what they're doing I think

5127.179 --> 5132.28
that's literally why they do that

5129.58 --> 5135.04
why that's being done out there just

5132.28 --> 5137.679
weird things that are completely off

5135.04 --> 5139.179
the range are rolled out so people are

5137.679 --> 5141.1
like what what the hell going on what's

5139.179 --> 5142.9
this and then they get into it and then

5141.1 --> 5144.400000000001
it just turns into a dead end and

5142.9 --> 5147.639999999999
they're really confused and then

5144.4 --> 5150.099999999999
whatever they were doing before that is

5147.64 --> 5151.84
just gone

5150.1 --> 5153.76
they just lost

5151.84 --> 5155.56
their moment

5153.76 --> 5158.219
I think that's why they do that sort of

5155.56 --> 5161.1990000000005
thing roll out complete nonsense

5158.219 --> 5164.159
unexpectedly and then pretend it never

5161.199 --> 5164.159
happened afterwards

5164.199 --> 5169.0
it's to keep people [ __ ]

5167.44 --> 5170.86
because when people are [ __ ]

5169.0 --> 5173.32
disrupted

5170.86 --> 5176.5199999999995
blown their concentration

5173.32 --> 5176.5199999999995
they're more predictable

5179.38 --> 5185.46
and their system that's that like count

5182.38 --> 5185.46
on that happening

5185.5 --> 5191.04
ways to make profit through that

5188.199 --> 5191.04
predictability

5197.86 --> 5202.5599999999995
the entire Mandela effect to sign up

5200.139 --> 5202.56
like that

5203.98 --> 5209.678999999999
it is

5206.44 --> 5214.36
the Mandela effect is a psychological

5209.679 --> 5217.9
operation it is palpably

5214.36 --> 5220.48
it is a psychological operation exactly

5217.9 --> 5223.0
that's what the Mandela effect is it's

5220.48 --> 5224.86
purely psychological the people that

5223.0 --> 5226.78
reinforce that there's some dimensional

5224.86 --> 5229.179
switching going on they're [ __ ]

5226.78 --> 5230.98
delusional they don't have evidence for

5229.179 --> 5234.28
that they're just [ __ ] delusional

5230.98 --> 5237.28
Matrix theorists

5234.28 --> 5240.5199999999995
yeah delusional but there is

5237.28 --> 5243.159
psychological [ __ ] going on though

5240.52 --> 5247.2390000000005
and that's provable

5243.159 --> 5249.219
like aesthetic design decisions that are

5247.239 --> 5252.638999999999
on purpose

5249.219 --> 5255.52
off from what the universal person's

5252.639 --> 5259.96
mind would expect

5255.52 --> 5261.219
and they do that on purpose yeah

5259.96 --> 5264.2390000000005
like

5261.219 --> 5268.56
the bracers girl at the James Bond movie

5264.239 --> 5271.178999999999
every [ __ ] person in the world

5268.56 --> 5274.4800000000005
insisted when first watching that movie

5271.179 --> 5279.219
and even afterward that she would have

5274.48 --> 5283.48
to have the braces because story wise

5279.219 --> 5287.5
that's exactly what would round it out

5283.48 --> 5290.32
and complete a pattern like to resolve

5287.5 --> 5292.96
an issue in the story it would have been

5290.32 --> 5295.9
the resolve that would be to make

5292.96 --> 5299.62
everybody yeah wow they finally they

5295.9 --> 5301.9
found love bracers and Jaws yeah

5299.62 --> 5304.78
in the moment everybody wanted it and

5301.9 --> 5308.0199999999995
they didn't do it and that was the

5304.78 --> 5310.42
Mandela effect they didn't do it on

5308.02 --> 5313.179
purpose

5310.42 --> 5314.4400000000005
to [ __ ] with you

5313.179 --> 5318.04
yeah

5314.44 --> 5320.5
that's what the Mandela effect is

5318.04 --> 5323.92
they don't do things they do things

5320.5 --> 5327.1
differently from what everybody would

5323.92 --> 5330.4
naturally anticipate would happen

5327.1 --> 5334.0
and then people can't handle not getting

5330.4 --> 5336.339999999999
that moment of satisfaction to resolve a

5334.0 --> 5338.5
story-based issue

5336.34 --> 5341.139
and then people get really disturbed

5338.5 --> 5344.86
about it because the movie isn't what

5341.139 --> 5346.54
you want what you need it to be you see

5344.86 --> 5348.46
there's something wrong with it there's

5346.54 --> 5350.92
an aesthetic break and that breaks

5348.46 --> 5355.06
people's minds and then their internal

5350.92 --> 5358.9
memory corrects it in their memory to

5355.06 --> 5361.659000000001
how it's supposed to be aesthetically

5358.9 --> 5363.5199999999995
not how it actually was but how it's

5361.659 --> 5368.5
supposed to be

5363.52 --> 5371.46
that is the Mandela effect it's in

5368.5 --> 5371.46
people's minds

5381.12 --> 5389.679
yeah they make things off on purpose

5386.679 --> 5391.96
to [ __ ] with you

5389.679 --> 5394.719
it's an ad it's actually even part of

5391.96 --> 5397.3
standard advertising strategies

5394.719 --> 5400.84
like that's that technique to do that

5397.3 --> 5404.679
make it slightly off is in books

5400.84 --> 5409.2390000000005
for advertising strategies it really is

5404.679 --> 5412.2390000000005
yeah some people just took it really far

5409.239 --> 5415.12
they didn't do it for an ad

5412.239 --> 5416.678999999999
they did it in a movie just because they

5415.12 --> 5419.26
could

5416.679 --> 5422.28
and also because the people that do get

5419.26 --> 5426.9400000000005
Mandela affected you know they get

5422.28 --> 5429.94
obsessed with their respective product

5426.94 --> 5432.638999999999
from which they've experienced the

5429.94 --> 5434.799999999999
Mandela effect yeah they get obsessed

5432.639 --> 5438.219
with the product

5434.8 --> 5442.12
oh what is just a coincidence it's just

5438.219 --> 5444.34
I mean that that wasn't like the purpose

5442.12 --> 5445.719
of it

5444.34 --> 5447.34
huh

5445.719 --> 5448.6
huh

5447.34 --> 5451.54
see

5448.6 --> 5454.42
what it is

5451.54 --> 5456.88
it's on purpose to make you obsessed

5454.42 --> 5459.6990000000005
with it if you're obsessed with the

5456.88 --> 5461.56
product that's good advertisement that

5459.699 --> 5462.94
means that somebody's obsessed with the

5461.56 --> 5465.159000000001
product

5462.94 --> 5469.0599999999995
that that means that that product is

5465.159 --> 5470.98
probably gonna get more attention

5469.06 --> 5472.120000000001
even if just negative attention doesn't

5470.98 --> 5473.678999999999
matter it's going to get more attention

5472.12 --> 5474.94
people that are obsessed don't let

5473.679 --> 5477.82
things go

5474.94 --> 5481.419999999999
so an advertisement of a Mandela effect

5477.82 --> 5483.46
is Gonna Last potentially decades

5481.42 --> 5485.9800000000005
yeah people are going to remember some

5483.46 --> 5488.679
stupid little Mandela affected ad in

5485.98 --> 5490.839999999999
their mind for decades

5488.679 --> 5493.2390000000005
still harping on about it still making

5490.84 --> 5494.1990000000005
live shows talking about it referencing

5493.239 --> 5496.239
it

5494.199 --> 5498.58
there was no manila effect

5496.239 --> 5500.379999999999
nobody would have remembered

5498.58 --> 5501.76
it would have been forgotten 20 years

5500.38 --> 5504.2390000000005
ago

5501.76 --> 5508.2390000000005
yeah it's called

5504.239 --> 5508.239
advertisement tactic

5528.82 --> 5533.88
yeah

5530.08 --> 5533.88
it's Advanced programming

5547.26 --> 5552.280000000001
but you see how that works I mean people

5550.12 --> 5555.219
don't have consciousness of that a lot

5552.28 --> 5556.54
of the time is that the Mind wants

5555.219 --> 5560.02
things

5556.54 --> 5561.699
in a certain way you want a story to be

5560.02 --> 5566.56
resolved

5561.699 --> 5569.98
you want a point to remain strong

5566.56 --> 5573.639
you want the atmosphere the feelings to

5569.98 --> 5576.82
be consistent you want the visuals and

5573.639 --> 5580.179
the sounds to be coherent

5576.82 --> 5582.82
with the story and the style and the

5580.179 --> 5585.639
setup you want all the things to be in

5582.82 --> 5589.78
place to be right to have a point yeah

5585.639 --> 5591.9400000000005
and so if something in that is off

5589.78 --> 5594.4
and you don't understand that about

5591.94 --> 5596.199
yourself then you're gonna be really

5594.4 --> 5598.659
freaked out

5596.199 --> 5602.379999999999
because there's a there's a likelihood

5598.659 --> 5606.04
that you'll literally remember it wrong

5602.38 --> 5608.88
because it was wrong to your internal

5606.04 --> 5608.88
interpretation

5609.52 --> 5615.9400000000005
it wasn't the way it's supposed to be

5612.3 --> 5618.78
according to aesthetic logic

5615.94 --> 5618.78
you see

5621.699 --> 5624.5199999999995
and that's when the memory starts

5623.38 --> 5626.92
[ __ ] with you

5624.52 --> 5631.2390000000005
and the same happens by the way with

5626.92 --> 5633.88
people yeah your relationship

5631.239 --> 5636.339999999999
especially fresh yeah there's things

5633.88 --> 5638.8
that your spouse or whatever your

5636.34 --> 5641.5
boyfriend girlfriend might do

5638.8 --> 5643.0
that literally is really out of place

5641.5 --> 5645.1
here

5643.0 --> 5647.679
and then you'll be inclined to just like

5645.1 --> 5650.26
well I'm just gonna completely put that

5647.679 --> 5652.9
on the side and not let that be part of

5650.26 --> 5655.06
the overview of the person that I think

5652.9 --> 5657.699
they are

5655.06 --> 5659.679
just put it in the back

5657.699 --> 5661.9
and then later

5659.679 --> 5664.06
if that becomes an item you'll be like

5661.9 --> 5667.239
what are you talking about

5664.06 --> 5670.84
you don't do that

5667.239 --> 5673.9
because it's not it didn't fit it didn't

5670.84 --> 5677.9400000000005
fit in your picture of that person so

5673.9 --> 5680.62
you will completely forget that exists

5677.94 --> 5682.0
aesthetic correction system in the

5680.62 --> 5686.32
psyche

5682.0 --> 5688.42
that is the Mandela effect the Mandela

5686.32 --> 5690.88
effect is a hundred percent

5688.42 --> 5692.86
psychological

5690.88 --> 5695.4400000000005
provable

5692.86 --> 5698.28
logically

5695.44 --> 5698.28
provable

5701.06 --> 5705.6990000000005
[Music]

5707.32 --> 5711.179
nobody even knew them and that is

5721.54 --> 5727.96
nobody says magic mirror no but because

5724.84 --> 5731.02
that stupid because in typical fairy

5727.96 --> 5733.42
tales it's Mirror Mirror yeah blue build

5731.02 --> 5735.46
Evolution it's because the original

5733.42 --> 5737.62
material

5735.46 --> 5739.9
does that

5737.62 --> 5741.46
that's why

5739.9 --> 5744.04
but guess what

5741.46 --> 5746.699
Disney thought oh we're gonna do it

5744.04 --> 5748.26
slightly different we're gonna take that

5746.699 --> 5751.178999999999
exact

5748.26 --> 5753.719
aesthetic pattern that's been culturally

5751.179 --> 5757.9
echoed for hundreds of years probably

5753.719 --> 5761.62
and then make it magic mirror oh that's

5757.9 --> 5764.379999999999
not on purpose at all no it they're not

5761.62 --> 5766.239
trying to [ __ ] with your mind so you'll

5764.38 --> 5768.1
get obsessed with their stupid little

5766.239 --> 5771.04
cartoon forever

5768.1 --> 5772.84
and think all his magic is evil yeah

5771.04 --> 5774.82
they just [ __ ] with your mind because

5772.84 --> 5778.06
they changed it

5774.82 --> 5782.08
to stupid magic mirror which is not the

5778.06 --> 5784.0
original way it is remembered for

5782.08 --> 5787.84
Generations

5784.0 --> 5790.199
that's why they changed it the [ __ ] with

5787.84 --> 5790.1990000000005
you

5791.02 --> 5799.179
it was always changed to that to [ __ ]

5795.1 --> 5802.0
with you you just didn't remember it

5799.179 --> 5803.9800000000005
because you didn't want to remember that

5802.0 --> 5806.98
they [ __ ] with you you'd rather

5803.98 --> 5809.739
remember the way it has been remembered

5806.98 --> 5813.178999999999
for multiple Generations

5809.739 --> 5816.099999999999
yeah Mandela effect is in your mind

5813.179 --> 5820.1990000000005
doing those things

5816.1 --> 5820.1990000000005
telling you how it's supposed to be

5831.46 --> 5837.06
nobody remember yeah you don't remember

5833.199 --> 5837.0599999999995
yeah because you don't care

5837.44 --> 5841.0599999999995
[Music]

5839.199 --> 5842.86
I don't care

5841.06 --> 5844.900000000001
I don't care about freaking Disney

5842.86 --> 5846.699
movies and their stupid [ __ ] mind

5844.9 --> 5848.86
[ __ ] that they do because they've

5846.699 --> 5851.08
always been mind [ __ ] they always

5848.86 --> 5852.699
done that sort of [ __ ] with people in

5851.08 --> 5854.139
their movies they're slight different

5852.699 --> 5859.12
interpreter oh they have to do it the

5854.139 --> 5861.1
Disney way yeah why to [ __ ] with people

5859.12 --> 5863.62
that's why

5861.1 --> 5866.56
they're satanists

5863.62 --> 5867.82
they [ __ ] with people they want to [ __ ]

5866.56 --> 5870.76
with your mind

5867.82 --> 5873.34
they like doing that

5870.76 --> 5875.56
look at all these idiots decades and

5873.34 --> 5878.139
decades later still obsessively

5875.56 --> 5879.46
complaining and fear spiraling about

5878.139 --> 5881.679
their product

5879.46 --> 5883.2390000000005
all they had to do was just [ __ ] a

5881.679 --> 5886.12
little bit around with the Aesthetics

5883.239 --> 5888.82
and oh look people go crazy isn't that

5886.12 --> 5890.739
fun ah satanic Disney isn't that just

5888.82 --> 5892.5
fun just [ __ ] a little with their heads

5890.739 --> 5894.82
and they'll go all crazy it's so easy

5892.5 --> 5896.44
they're so stupid they don't even

5894.82 --> 5898.9
understand what their own [ __ ] mind

5896.44 --> 5900.46
is doing they're that's stupid so why

5898.9 --> 5901.54
wouldn't you [ __ ] around with their

5900.46 --> 5904.179
heads then

5901.54 --> 5906.1
because people are [ __ ] [ __ ]

5904.179 --> 5908.56
they were running around blabbering

5906.1 --> 5911.9800000000005
nonsense for 20 years straight because

5908.56 --> 5914.080000000001
of one little [ __ ] trick they did

5911.98 --> 5916.599999999999
and they still after 20 years don't

5914.08 --> 5919.179
understand what the [ __ ] going on

5916.6 --> 5920.679
that's hilarious to a Satanist it's

5919.179 --> 5924.78
hilarious

5920.679 --> 5924.78
look at the idiot look at them

5926.52 --> 5930.820000000001
you never liked Disney when I was young

5928.659 --> 5934.54
I avoided Disney when I was young Disney

5930.82 --> 5937.54
was like kind of barred

5934.54 --> 5941.76
in our household

5937.54 --> 5941.76
we didn't watch Disney [ __ ] ever

5946.12 --> 5949.5
we didn't have those movies

5949.719 --> 5954.82
there's no girls in our house anyway so

5952.239 --> 5956.5599999999995
it's like yeah I mean Disney was like a

5954.82 --> 5959.62
girl thing

5956.56 --> 5962.04
in my day that's how I saw it I didn't

5959.62 --> 5962.04
like Disney

5964.46 --> 5969.28
[Music]

5966.58 --> 5972.32
ever watched Lion King yeah

5969.28 --> 5975.38
afterward on DVD

5972.32 --> 5975.38
[Music]

5976.5 --> 5982.54
in a download era I mean yeah I did

5979.48 --> 5983.5599999999995
watch movies afterwards but when I was

5982.54 --> 5985.63
young

5983.56 --> 5987.6990000000005
I didn't give a [ __ ]

5985.63 --> 5990.58
[Music]

5987.699 --> 5992.739
yeah sure if a Disney movie or like a

5990.58 --> 5994.78
cartoon thing would come on TV then

5992.739 --> 5996.879999999999
maybe I'd watch it

5994.78 --> 5999.759999999999
but to be fair I was overall more

5996.88 --> 6003.12
interested in just like movies

5999.76 --> 6005.34
live action movies then cartoon movies

6003.12 --> 6007.5
from Disney

6005.34 --> 6009.179
right unless it's like Transformers or

6007.5 --> 6011.28
something then it's freaking then I

6009.179 --> 6013.1990000000005
loved it I didn't like Disney [ __ ] I

6011.28 --> 6015.659
liked Saturday morning cartoons more

6013.199 --> 6018.839999999999
than Disney stuff

6015.659 --> 6021.0599999999995
but Disney was just gross in ways it is

6018.84 --> 6023.219
gross I mean it's really [ __ ] gross

6021.06 --> 6026.580000000001
and manipulative and just

6023.219 --> 6030.42
creepy a lot of the time

6026.58 --> 6033.9
and they're they're funny characters are

6030.42 --> 6037.4400000000005
often really freaking creepy

6033.9 --> 6040.32
it's like oh hi Sue I'm so funny

6037.44 --> 6043.199
you're just gross disgusting figure

6040.32 --> 6045.84
that's pretending to be funny

6043.199 --> 6047.339999999999
so people when they bump into that sort

6045.84 --> 6050.58
of person they'll think oh they're funny

6047.34 --> 6053.76
when they're actually disgusting rapists

6050.58 --> 6056.6
and [ __ ] like [ __ ] Disney [ __ ]

6053.76 --> 6056.6
everything they do

6065.34 --> 6070.62
I mean

6067.08 --> 6074.9
most women that grow up watching Disney

6070.62 --> 6074.9
movies become mentally deranged

6077.58 --> 6082.739
not all of them but most of them do

6080.3 --> 6083.900000000001
especially when they don't have very

6082.739 --> 6086.459999999999
strict

6083.9 --> 6089.099999999999
psychological emotional guidance from

6086.46 --> 6091.44
their parents their parents just put

6089.1 --> 6093.120000000001
them behind the TV watching some stupid

6091.44 --> 6097.0199999999995
Disney video

6093.12 --> 6099.0599999999995
they're gonna get [ __ ] up

6097.02 --> 6101.96
yeah

6099.06 --> 6101.96
they will

6103.32 --> 6108.78
seen it happening

6105.96 --> 6110.76
you can point them up you can point out

6108.78 --> 6112.5599999999995
the Disney girls that grew up with that

6110.76 --> 6116.6990000000005
[ __ ] and neglect

6112.56 --> 6119.6990000000005
you can point them out what they're like

6116.699 --> 6122.159
usually they are like

6119.699 --> 6124.619
attention [ __ ] trying to make a scene

6122.159 --> 6127.638999999999
if they don't get their way

6124.619 --> 6127.639
terrible figures

6129.06 --> 6131.719
uh

6145.38 --> 6149.9400000000005
be managed here yeah that's not Disney

6148.56 --> 6151.7390000000005
though

6149.94 --> 6155.5199999999995
let's

6151.739 --> 6158.339999999999
that's just the weirdness of the 80s

6155.52 --> 6161.280000000001
so there was a lot of weird dubious [ __ ]

6158.34 --> 6163.56
going around in just cartoons as well

6161.28 --> 6166.38
not the non-disney cartoon there was a

6163.56 --> 6169.080000000001
lot of weirdness going around dude I

6166.38 --> 6172.46
mean Transformers is really weird when

6169.08 --> 6172.46
you look deeper into it

6178.02 --> 6185.46
I mean they they did an occult

6181.52 --> 6188.639
political stunt okay it's really

6185.46 --> 6191.6
egregious I never even realized that

6188.639 --> 6191.6
until way later

6193.94 --> 6198.0
anybody remember like the Transformers

6196.8 --> 6200.820000000001
the movie

6198.0 --> 6203.34
that Infamous one that got all the kids

6200.82 --> 6205.08
crying out of the theater because it was

6203.34 --> 6208.26
actually much more adult and

6205.08 --> 6211.44
Transformers suddenly died for real

6208.26 --> 6215.34
that movie it was really awesome in a

6211.44 --> 6216.839999999999
way but it was also a propaganda piece

6215.34 --> 6218.639
you know why

6216.84 --> 6222.119000000001
because they literally killed off

6218.639 --> 6224.52
Optimus Prime and replaced him with raw

6222.119 --> 6228.239
Demus Prime

6224.52 --> 6231.42
you know what Rodimus is

6228.239 --> 6234.0199999999995
Hillary Clinton's middle name

6231.42 --> 6234.02
yeah

6234.119 --> 6239.46
oh you think that's a coincidence oh by

6237.119 --> 6241.86
the way Rodimus Prime

6239.46 --> 6244.9800000000005
and hot rod are like the most hated

6241.86 --> 6248.5199999999995
characters in Transformers

6244.98 --> 6251.4
like the third season was terrible

6248.52 --> 6253.9800000000005
Rodimus as a leader was complete [ __ ]

6251.4 --> 6256.259999999999
and neglectful and spiteful and he

6253.98 --> 6260.299999999999
didn't give a [ __ ] about anybody it was

6256.26 --> 6262.679
terrible yeah but that is real it's real

6260.3 --> 6265.619000000001
they did that

6262.679 --> 6267.719
they suddenly took the kids cartoon made

6265.619 --> 6270.0
it really adults it had all kinds of

6267.719 --> 6273.78
Transformers just die like on screen

6270.0 --> 6275.82
like having their like their holes in

6273.78 --> 6278.099999999999
their chest blown and smoke coming out

6275.82 --> 6280.739
of their mouth dropping dead and [ __ ]

6278.1 --> 6282.96
okay that's never happened before and

6280.739 --> 6285.78
they killed off Optimus Prime the

6282.96 --> 6288.08
ultimate iconic hero of the entire

6285.78 --> 6288.08
series

6288.179 --> 6294.719
and then replaced him with some stupid

6293.1 --> 6297.4800000000005
modernized

6294.719 --> 6300.44
looking car guy that's really just a

6297.48 --> 6302.339999999999
dick and not a leader at all

6300.44 --> 6305.099999999999
rademus

6302.34 --> 6308.04
came Rodimus Prime with the Matrix and

6305.1 --> 6309.6
Leadership and then he became completely

6308.04 --> 6311.94
[ __ ] useless

6309.6 --> 6315.3
and wasn't terrible leader after that

6311.94 --> 6317.879999999999
yeah that happened I mean

6315.3 --> 6321.02
the [ __ ]

6317.88 --> 6321.02
you didn't know that

6323.52 --> 6326.780000000001
I didn't know that

6332.699 --> 6337.739
but I mean that was specifically the

6335.58 --> 6341.4
name chosen for the character that was

6337.739 --> 6344.4
literally created then they created that

6341.4 --> 6347.219
character in that movie the movie was

6344.4 --> 6348.48
the coming out of a whole new season of

6347.219 --> 6351.659
characters

6348.48 --> 6354.718999999999
and Rodimus Prime was the new leader

6351.659 --> 6359.879999999999
that's not a coincidental pick

6354.719 --> 6362.4
okay that was a bought in Choice I'm

6359.88 --> 6364.32
pretty sure they got sponsorship to do

6362.4 --> 6367.92
that and hey the quality of the movie

6364.32 --> 6370.619
The visuals were absolutely amazing so

6367.92 --> 6372.4800000000005
I'm pretty sure they got some some real

6370.619 --> 6375.0599999999995
money

6372.48 --> 6377.58
for that thing but it's it feels like

6375.06 --> 6383.06
it's politically involved

6377.58 --> 6383.0599999999995
and if the people there actually did it

6383.1 --> 6387.900000000001
without being bought off it's even worse

6385.98 --> 6392.28
because that means that the Transformers

6387.9 --> 6393.719
crew were actually liberal liberals

6392.28 --> 6398.179
as in

6393.719 --> 6398.179
super Hollywood leftist

6400.92 --> 6405.9
now in a way I'm not surprised because I

6402.78 --> 6411.86
also know that the the voice actor

6405.9 --> 6411.86
of Optimus Prime is a flaming [ __ ]

6413.4 --> 6418.44
so I'm not surprised in that sense a lot

6415.92 --> 6422.659
of those cartoon people were I mean the

6418.44 --> 6422.659
whole He-Man crew is gay as [ __ ]

6423.179 --> 6429.9800000000005
liberal liberals right

6425.4 --> 6429.98
so yeah that's the thing too

6433.619 --> 6439.38
right all these all the things even the

6436.92 --> 6442.02
ones that we really love

6439.38 --> 6444.78
when is something is like outstandingly

6442.02 --> 6448.92
better than it was before

6444.78 --> 6451.46
it's usually mind [ __ ] time

6448.92 --> 6453.719
they're usually making something

6451.46 --> 6459.42
unusually great

6453.719 --> 6460.9800000000005
to get some imprint on you yeah

6459.42 --> 6463.26
oh it's a product you'll love it oh

6460.98 --> 6466.739
suddenly it's becoming really great

6463.26 --> 6468.780000000001
in one moment watch out that's when they

6466.739 --> 6471.0599999999995
try to program you

6468.78 --> 6474.119
they do

6471.06 --> 6476.219
that's how it works you have a product a

6474.119 --> 6479.46
series whatever it's has a consistent

6476.219 --> 6482.159
quality people like it oh it gets really

6479.46 --> 6484.92
great all of a sudden watch out for

6482.159 --> 6486.96
programming watch out that's how they

6484.92 --> 6488.88
slip it in they slip it in in the

6486.96 --> 6492.36
moments where you're like wow this

6488.88 --> 6494.1
is wanted that's when they come in and

6492.36 --> 6497.48
they plant it

6494.1 --> 6497.4800000000005
that's how they do it

6497.94 --> 6502.739
in the moment where you let your guard

6499.98 --> 6505.678999999999
down because you're in ecstasy that's

6502.739 --> 6509.239
when they try to program you and they

6505.679 --> 6509.2390000000005
know when those moments happen

6509.28 --> 6513.438999999999
foreign

6510.42 --> 6513.439
[Music]

6523.04 --> 6530.1
took the Matrix of leadership like

6525.659 --> 6531.96
inside from Galvatron inside of Unicron

6530.1 --> 6534.2390000000005
in his head

6531.96 --> 6536.46
and he took the Matrix and like grew

6534.239 --> 6539.638999999999
into Rodimus Prime it was one of the

6536.46 --> 6543.119
most awesome ecstatic moments I've ever

6539.639 --> 6546.06
had in Transformers yeah it's literally

6543.119 --> 6548.94
the glorification of Rodimus a freaking

6546.06 --> 6552.360000000001
Hillary Clinton name into the ultimate

6548.94 --> 6555.119
leader I mean that is programming that

6552.36 --> 6557.82
is as straightforward psychological

6555.119 --> 6560.179
programming as I've ever experienced in

6557.82 --> 6560.179
my life

6564.179 --> 6569.28
yeah the direct Association of Hillary

6566.94 --> 6571.98
Clinton's name with like the replacement

6569.28 --> 6574.679
of the ultimate leader

6571.98 --> 6576.78
in an Ascension moment an ecstatic and

6574.679 --> 6579.179
awesome rock music and it's like yeah

6576.78 --> 6581.4
we're gonna touch we're gonna finally

6579.179 --> 6583.38
destroy Unicorn it's like ultimate

6581.4 --> 6588.659
ecstatic release

6583.38 --> 6592.26
and the glorification of Rodimus okay

6588.659 --> 6596.78
it is as straightforward propaganda

6592.26 --> 6596.780000000001
placement as I've ever spotted

6599.0 --> 6606.48
and it it's still annoying me because

6603.02 --> 6609.659000000001
it's still a really awesome movie with

6606.48 --> 6612.718999999999
really like the feel I loved it I still

6609.659 --> 6616.5199999999995
loved the movie I still love it

6612.719 --> 6616.52
but I know that about it now

6620.46 --> 6624.4800000000005
when I first found out that Hillary

6622.5 --> 6627.78
Clinton's middle name was Rodimus I was

6624.48 --> 6631.099999999999
really freaked out I was like what what

6627.78 --> 6631.099999999999
the [ __ ] are you talking about

6638.3 --> 6642.78
watching these shows okay

6641.219 --> 6647.179
fine

6642.78 --> 6647.179
talking about Transformers G1

6648.54 --> 6657.719
and specifically Transformers the movie

6653.159 --> 6661.5
the original drawn movie

6657.719 --> 6665.639
