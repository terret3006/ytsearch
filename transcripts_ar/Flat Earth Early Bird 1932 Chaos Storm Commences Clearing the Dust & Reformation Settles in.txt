Arwin right weather today is

110.84 --> 118.479
restless it's been very

114.0 --> 123.799
windy entire morning the entire

118.479 --> 123.799
morning so is blowing hard it's very

124.64 --> 130.92
clouded it's not been raining that I've

127.399 --> 134.48
noticed but it's

130.92 --> 139.319
just guts of wind are just continually

134.48 --> 139.319
pounding against the the wall and all

141.84 --> 147.68
that so quite the contrast with

144.68 --> 147.68
yesterday

151.44 --> 153.72
all

157.25 --> 163.159
[Music]

159.239 --> 165.36
right hello g h first in chat good to

163.159 --> 165.35999999999999
see

165.519 --> 171.08
you it is Sunday the 28th of April

176.239 --> 182.48000000000002
2024 temperature is 6 16°

185.76 --> 193.959
C 58%

188.92 --> 196.28
humidity yeah and a bit of wind 35 km an

193.959 --> 198.48
hour right it's starting to get a little

196.28 --> 198.48
bit

208.519 --> 211.76000000000002
warmer right

213.08 --> 219.56
so yeah at a late night last night hey

215.959 --> 219.56
Thor KC good to see

221.36 --> 226.56
you you never find me right at the start

224.04 --> 229.239
of the stream

226.56 --> 231.84
yeah I don't know why but I mean these

229.239 --> 234.0
days uh my streams

231.84 --> 238.959
now are

234.0 --> 238.959
there before I start the Stream

243.879 --> 249.28
right so if you just go to my channel

246.64 --> 250.83999999999997
you can literally see like when there's

249.28 --> 253.4
an upcoming stream and everything

250.84 --> 255.76
especially if you uh hit the Bell

253.4 --> 258.959
notification you'll get a half an hour

255.76 --> 258.959
warning in advance

262.16 --> 269.0
so yeah I schedule the show now that's

265.28 --> 269.0
right g h

270.639 --> 276.759
right I figured out how to do that and

273.4 --> 281.63899999999995
it's actually quite

276.759 --> 281.639
easy turned out to be easier than I

281.72 --> 288.199
thought although like there's been some

284.24 --> 288.199
transformations of like how

288.68 --> 295.44
YouTube does that and yeah it's very

291.88 --> 295.44
doable now

305.24 --> 311.96000000000004
right so yeah

308.479 --> 311.96
yesterday busy

314.52 --> 317.52
day

318.24 --> 324.12
uh show turned out to be pretty decent I

321.84 --> 327.52
mean in the middle there was like this

324.12 --> 329.8
vacuum where nobody was saying anything

327.52 --> 333.15999999999997
and I got a bit annoyed but like at the

329.8 --> 337.16
end of yeah the end part of the stream

333.16 --> 337.16
was interesting again and got

341.28 --> 344.28
fluid

344.479 --> 349.12
what up my Bing out your

351.479 --> 357.56
arcades

354.199 --> 357.56
something oh

358.16 --> 363.12
okay got a bit of the flooding issues

360.52 --> 363.12
over there

365.24 --> 373.52
dorc or you just you're just

369.919 --> 379.12
anticipating for if there will be floods

373.52 --> 379.12
all right well very wise to think

385.24 --> 390.16
ahead where are you at by the way

401.24 --> 407.0
right anyway yeah yes the show was

408.68 --> 412.24
fine and

413.24 --> 419.0
uh see later that evening I did watch a

417.039 --> 420.479
bunch of streams yeah I did watch the

419.0 --> 423.199
Joe

420.479 --> 426.52
thing but not for very

423.199 --> 428.639
long it it was like a 3our stream and I

426.52 --> 431.639
watched like 10 minutes of it and then I

428.639 --> 431.639
got

432.84 --> 438.96
bored like oh yeah moonlanding

435.759 --> 442.16
skepticism and I'm like this is all just

438.96 --> 442.15999999999997
presupposing a

443.879 --> 449.59900000000005
lot and I'm sure that that guy like

447.68 --> 453.40000000000003
really welldeveloped argumentation

449.599 --> 456.44
ations and all that but yeah I mean I I

453.4 --> 458.28
didn't get to it all like I'm definitely

456.44 --> 462.199
not going to

458.28 --> 462.19899999999996
watch 3 hours of

462.36 --> 467.8
that right but later that evening there

464.56 --> 470.68
was ball busters live and I was part of

467.8 --> 474.08
that show I just got on there from the

470.68 --> 476.68
start and it was pretty good last five

474.08 --> 479.68
more than 5 hours if you can't believe

476.68 --> 482.8
that crazy long but it was was

479.68 --> 485.56
interesting and they were reviewing or

482.8 --> 490.199
we were reviewing the

485.56 --> 492.0
uh wh it gets it with Harrison Smith on

490.199 --> 494.039
Owen uh

492.0 --> 496.72
Owen on

494.039 --> 502.08
Infowars like the first half of

496.72 --> 502.08000000000004
it and yeah that was hilarious

515.2 --> 521.159
right but also like kind of

518.2 --> 524.12
tedious because I already I watched that

521.159 --> 528.959
part like the first half of

524.12 --> 530.72
it and like they like never it was just

528.959 --> 534.04
all about the

530.72 --> 537.0400000000001
sky it's all about oh the moon mostly

534.04 --> 540.92
and like orbits

537.04 --> 545.04
and Pathways and patterns and that and

540.92 --> 547.68
like ironically Harrison even

545.04 --> 550.16
earlier within that debate said like oh

547.68 --> 552.8
yeah we'll get to the Earth and and

550.16 --> 554.7199999999999
curve and all that but they never do

552.8 --> 557.7199999999999
they never get to it they never address

554.72 --> 561.0
it it was only talking about the

557.72 --> 562.1600000000001
sky and wit it pretty much just gave it

561.0 --> 565.48
all

562.16 --> 568.8389999999999
away he just gave him

565.48 --> 571.48
everything there no real hardcore

568.839 --> 576.2
argument he wasn't really arguing for

571.48 --> 576.2
the Flat Earth he was more arguing for

576.24 --> 583.04
geocentrism and just seemed to like try

579.56 --> 584.92
to maneuver the conversation towards

583.04 --> 588.7199999999999
like

584.92 --> 588.7199999999999
him talking about

589.44 --> 596.0
ether although never really fullon got

592.32 --> 600.0790000000001
to that but maybe in the second half he

596.0 --> 602.12
will I don't know but yeah it supposed

600.079 --> 604.0
Flat Earth debate there was no flat

602.12 --> 607.48
Earth

604.0 --> 607.48
debate there just

608.399 --> 611.399
wasn't

614.79 --> 617.89
[Music]

617.92 --> 624.8
right but it was pretty good to be part

621.279 --> 629.24
of that and give some input here and

624.8 --> 629.24
there it was nice

636.24 --> 642.92
but it was very long like lasted until

639.76 --> 647.36
past two and I was kind of restless from

642.92 --> 647.36
it so I have had a pretty late

647.519 --> 652.88
night staying up

650.639 --> 657.36
uh

652.88 --> 657.36
that playing some video games

657.959 --> 662.68
and watch something else what was

668.72 --> 672.0400000000001
that I

672.44 --> 678.1600000000001
watching oh yeah yeah I was on on D

684.639 --> 690.279
live the MC Dirty Work had a stream

690.88 --> 697.8
and wait is he still

693.68 --> 702.76
going holy [ __ ] he's still

697.8 --> 702.76
going 10 hours that's

707.08 --> 710.159
[Music]

710.48 --> 714.399
insane right but it was really

712.399 --> 716.6
interesting because it was like a bit of

714.399 --> 720.2
history about the Jesuits was very

716.6 --> 723.24
elaborate presentation about that very

720.2 --> 726.519
elaborate and like involving Jesuit

723.24 --> 729.5600000000001
involvement in like the Civil War and

726.519 --> 732.12
everything in the United States very

729.56 --> 734.3599999999999
detailed it was interesting so I like

732.12 --> 737.199
was really kind of captivated listening

734.36 --> 740.8000000000001
to that while just playing a game and

737.199 --> 744.24
just trying to calm down

740.8 --> 749.12
but yeah got very late so I'm just a

744.24 --> 749.12
little tiny bit wonky from that

755.12 --> 758.72
but overall I do feel good and

761.32 --> 766.6800000000001
stable stable considering the

764.44 --> 769.1990000000001
circumstances like I am recovering from

766.68 --> 773.079
my instability I'm noticing that I am

769.199 --> 773.079
recovering from it

805.199 --> 815.279
got a key okay debatable d right so you

809.279 --> 815.279
played a bunch of games okay fair enough

845.639 --> 852.48
right so yeah also uh

848.88 --> 852.48
contacted blue pill

853.079 --> 860.399
Devolution and I think later today I'm

858.12 --> 862.88
going to have another night owl show and

860.399 --> 865.68
with him just talk about stuff I don't

862.88 --> 869.32
know exactly what probably a lot of

865.68 --> 869.3199999999999
community talk

876.759 --> 881.279
like 11 a.m. California

881.68 --> 888.04
time so that should be somewhere in the

885.32 --> 888.0400000000001
evening for

888.079 --> 893.12
me right so yeah keep an eye out for

893.88 --> 900.4399999999999
that yeah busy weekend

897.839 --> 902.6800000000001
indeed right and tomorrow I'm going to

900.44 --> 905.8000000000001
have a very short

902.68 --> 908.6389999999999
show because I got an appointment to

905.8 --> 911.279
talk with my landlord and stuff about

908.639 --> 911.279
some things

912.199 --> 918.12
and so tomorrow I will have a show but

915.24 --> 922.759
it will not it will like last two hours

918.12 --> 922.759
or something not super long that's

926.399 --> 933.839
it then yeah

930.92 --> 933.8389999999999
so that's the

945.12 --> 951.399
schedule all right so now I hope some

947.72 --> 951.399
more people find the show on this

954.0 --> 958.8
Sunday just draws

959.04 --> 964.519
seemed that me returning yesterday to

961.48 --> 967.279
ballusters triggered a whole bunch of

964.519 --> 971.68
trolls the Virgin Droid has his hands

967.279 --> 971.68
full with it like the entire

980.0 --> 986.079
show looks like they're still awake not

983.6 --> 986.0790000000001
having a

986.36 --> 994.519
life but yeah I have no problems

990.56 --> 999.3599999999999
just removing all that but I hope that

994.519 --> 1001.639
some actual chat participants Will Roll

999.36 --> 1003.92
in otherwise it's going to be kind of a

1001.639 --> 1003.92
quiet

1008.639 --> 1013.319
show all right but I'll still have the

1010.759 --> 1013.319
blue P

1013.56 --> 1017.56
Evolution KN I will show later to look

1016.399 --> 1021.759
forward

1017.56 --> 1021.7589999999999
to turn Tado watch

1022.079 --> 1025.399
season for

1035.039 --> 1041.559
KC all of your basement started to leak

1037.72 --> 1041.559
water that's that's not

1043.799 --> 1049.959
good yeah that sucks sorry to hear that

1055.3 --> 1058.44
[Music]

1057.08 --> 1060.76
so I guess you're going to be kind of

1058.44 --> 1064.52
busy with that for a

1060.76 --> 1068.64
while heard from clutch also has issues

1064.52 --> 1068.6399999999999
like that over in

1069.64 --> 1073.48
Canada so tornado season you say where

1072.4 --> 1078.8400000000001
are you

1073.48 --> 1078.84
at are you like in Florida or something

1080.159 --> 1084.48
that's usually where a lot of tornadoes

1082.039 --> 1084.48
tend to

1092.159 --> 1096.6000000000001
hit all right I hope you stay completely

1094.919 --> 1099.0
clear of those

1096.6 --> 1105.36
though otherwise you might have bigger

1099.0 --> 1105.36
troubles than just a basement leak huh

1106.33 --> 1114.1699999999998
[Music]

1117.45 --> 1121.259
[Music]

1122.799 --> 1130.6399999999999
my PCP specs it's not really any of your

1126.679 --> 1130.64
business debatable d

1139.48 --> 1143.64
all you need to know is that it works

1145.28 --> 1150.44
fine only thing I got a bit of an issue

1147.679 --> 1153.919
with is the monitor that's kind of

1150.44 --> 1158.24
like glitching a little which is

1153.919 --> 1162.679
Annoying It's still table but it's

1158.24 --> 1162.679
annoying but uh

1166.33 --> 1170.48
[Music]

1168.84 --> 1173.1589999999999
as it doesn't get any problems like

1170.48 --> 1175.44
turning on and all that it should just

1173.159 --> 1175.44
be

1191.28 --> 1197.12
fine right in the middle of Country okay

1199.48 --> 1206.84
yes debatable D It's Working still it's

1202.679 --> 1206.8400000000001
fine no issues that's

1207.32 --> 1213.08
right the only issues I really bump into

1210.32 --> 1216.36
is that like certain games just won't

1213.08 --> 1220.32
run on it and that's

1216.36 --> 1224.1589999999999
it like newer games that's like the only

1220.32 --> 1224.1589999999999
issue I have really

1235.72 --> 1240.799
I get the network Wi-Fi stuff sorted no

1238.52 --> 1240.799
not

1242.76 --> 1249.12
really but I got a emergency internet

1247.039 --> 1251.96
system still and it's just directly

1249.12 --> 1256.36
hooked up through USB so I don't have to

1251.96 --> 1256.3600000000001
interface with that through WiFi

1259.36 --> 1266.039
so I basically got like 4G internet

1261.88 --> 1269.64
right now and and it'll be like that for

1266.039 --> 1272.72
probably another week supposedly

1269.64 --> 1276.8400000000001
Wednesday or Thursday they were going to

1272.72 --> 1281.159
fix that but

1276.84 --> 1284.1999999999998
uh I mean there like there's a cable

1281.159 --> 1287.0
break somewhere outside of the building

1284.2 --> 1289.76
I have no idea how long that'll take

1287.0 --> 1292.2
like that might take a while

1289.76 --> 1292.2
but

1294.32 --> 1302.08
uh so someone wouldn't be able to gift

1297.36 --> 1302.08
you a newer game then yeah pretty

1303.919 --> 1309.1200000000001
much like the only way I could do that

1306.32 --> 1312.279
is if i' have like another

1309.12 --> 1316.12
SSD and try to install a newer version

1312.279 --> 1317.08
of Windows on that and then basically

1316.12 --> 1321.4399999999998
switch

1317.08 --> 1323.1589999999999
it and then I might be able to use that

1321.44 --> 1325.279
and to be fair I have actually

1323.159 --> 1327.5200000000002
considered

1325.279 --> 1332.24
upgrading it's just

1327.52 --> 1337.039
that I have this principle if it's not

1332.24 --> 1341.52
broke don't don't try to fix

1337.039 --> 1341.52
it and I really know Windows

1346.48 --> 1353.2
7 know where everything is

1349.44 --> 1357.679
is like the interface so I'm

1353.2 --> 1357.679
just I just like to hold on to

1375.24 --> 1380.44
that hello dupons good to see you

1424.799 --> 1427.799
okay

1451.2 --> 1457.0
yeah that was that was an idea gas h

1493.159 --> 1496.919
right but I'm not doing that right now

1495.48 --> 1501.159
like there's

1496.919 --> 1505.44
no no need for me to do that like I just

1501.159 --> 1509.3990000000001
need to keep going with what I

1505.44 --> 1512.8400000000001
have and like new games is not like

1509.399 --> 1512.84
that's not a priority right

1513.559 --> 1520.1589999999999
now if anything I I really would like a

1518.24 --> 1522.52
new

1520.159 --> 1526.279
monitor that's something that I'd really

1522.52 --> 1526.279
like a new monitor

1529.279 --> 1534.399
I can still keep going with this one but

1531.679 --> 1537.159
I would really like a new

1534.399 --> 1541.4799999999998
monitor and pretty much everything else

1537.159 --> 1541.48
is doesn't have any priority

1552.679 --> 1557.039
whatsoever although look if somebody's

1555.2 --> 1560.039
going to like help me out and send me an

1557.039 --> 1560.039
SSD

1562.48 --> 1570.279
that I could use to install

1565.76 --> 1574.96
a a new windows on then yeah I could

1570.279 --> 1574.96
potentially try that out for sure

1593.799 --> 1598.76
right but I mean like I'm not really

1596.76 --> 1602.799
going to do any of

1598.76 --> 1604.679
that until I get some money Surplus

1602.799 --> 1608.1589999999999
situation going

1604.679 --> 1612.1200000000001
on so I'll need some more

1608.159 --> 1612.1200000000001
support I always need more

1614.919 --> 1620.24
support you can do it on a USB stick

1618.12 --> 1620.2399999999998
what

1623.88 --> 1628.679
I don't think so you can't boot from a

1626.88 --> 1634.48
USB

1628.679 --> 1634.48
stick I mean there may be some

1635.08 --> 1645.559
uh non Windows systems Linux for example

1640.0 --> 1645.559
might be able to do that but uh

1654.919 --> 1661.279
but I mean if I'd got a new SSD that had

1658.12 --> 1667.08
decent amount of room on it that would

1661.279 --> 1667.08
work yes you can no no you

1669.08 --> 1673.8799999999999
can't you do it all the time well that's

1671.799 --> 1676.8799999999999
very cute I can't do that on this

1673.88 --> 1676.88
computer

1689.6 --> 1694.24
like a USB is not going to be big

1704.039 --> 1713.32

1709.96 --> 1715.8400000000001
yeah you can leave it alone now yeah I

1713.32 --> 1715.84
don't want

1724.399 --> 1732.08
it no I'm not

1727.6 --> 1734.9189999999999

1732.08 --> 1737.48
whining about my [ __ ] computer

Ancient Aliens video again that's that

2204.96 --> 2210.16
apparently just boot from a USB I don't

2216.359 --> 2224.4
care yeah good enough I was wrong I was

2220.839 --> 2227.119
wrong you can do it I don't care stop

2224.4 --> 2227.119
talking about

2241.04 --> 2249.04
it fix I don't need fixing it doesn't

2246.119 --> 2251.28
need fixing my computer is not broken

what you need a mask and ladex gloves

okay really

2314.72 --> 2317.72
why

2339.04 --> 2345.64
right but I mean if anything I could use

2341.68 --> 2348.72
like a new new SSD disc and if I could

2345.64 --> 2351.64
like copy my current SSD disc in its

2348.72 --> 2356.359
entirety onto the other

2351.64 --> 2358.7999999999997
one and then upgrade it from there on or

2356.359 --> 2360.319
something I mean I could like do it

2358.8 --> 2363.079
install from

2360.319 --> 2365.359
scratch whatever I still have an SSD

2363.079 --> 2367.119
disc but that thing is kind of unstable

2365.359 --> 2369.359
tends to like completely break down all

of a

2370.48 --> 2375.0
sudden like shut off that's

2385.76 --> 2392.2000000000003
annoying it's just like why

2389.2 --> 2392.2
now

2396.319 --> 2400.359
why for

2429.24 --> 2434.0
much rather talk about something flat

2431.599 --> 2434.0
earth

2439.16 --> 2445.56
related or anything else

2443.44 --> 2448.599
related related

2445.56 --> 2451.119
to Nazi Germany or

2448.599 --> 2453.04
something there's a lot of stuff like

2451.119 --> 2458.76
going around about

2453.04 --> 2458.7599999999998
that that continually bump into it

2459.24 --> 2466.52

no right I'm going to turn on my coffee

2569.2 --> 2573.16
and Illuminati C on in the oven

2571.24 --> 2574.9599999999996
hopefully after eating something I I'll

2573.16 --> 2579.1189999999997
get a little bit more

2574.96 --> 2579.119

2804.04 --> 2810.92
Hitler bump into all these weird little

2807.88 --> 2814.7200000000003
videos and one from X recently

2810.92 --> 2816.64
was like that's one of the more odd ones

2814.72 --> 2819.72
about how there were apparently a whole

2816.64 --> 2819.72
bunch of like

2820.839 --> 2825.52
crossdressers that were like homosexuals

2824.079 --> 2828.599
were

2825.52 --> 2833.319
apparently not tolerated but

2828.599 --> 2836.119
crossdressers were is like very

2833.319 --> 2838.16
odd and there's like photographic

2836.119 --> 2841.48
evidence of that and everything it's

2838.16 --> 2841.48
very strange

2856.16 --> 2859.24
hey Richard good to see

2859.8 --> 2865.4
you you tried to work out how

2862.4 --> 2868.1600000000003
perspective works for

2865.4 --> 2871.1600000000003
what what do you mean you can't work out

2868.16 --> 2871.16
perspective

2897.8 --> 2900.48
like what does that

2903.559 --> 2908.76
mean coding perspective uh

2912.319 --> 2918.359
isn't that just

2914.88 --> 2919.76
like a standard thing that just

2918.359 --> 2922.5989999999997
naturally

2919.76 --> 2925.0
happens within like rate tracing or

2922.599 --> 2929.3590000000004
however that process is called these

2925.0 --> 2929.359
days is that just what what

2930.24 --> 2938.5989999999997
happens like there's a just distance

2933.2 --> 2941.799
calculated and all that and then it like

2938.599 --> 2944.799
like I don't know how you'd separately

2941.799 --> 2944.799
have to code

2947.52 --> 2952.079
perspective for graphics rendering

2965.72 --> 2969.68
okay for

2970.26 --> 2978.1290000000004
[Music]

3002.0 --> 3009.16
yeah that's true th

3004.319 --> 3011.0
casc yeah that's right people like on

3009.16 --> 3012.96
theater women weren't allowed to

3011.0 --> 3015.52
participate and so men would have to

3012.96 --> 3018.76
play the role of the women in theater

3015.52 --> 3022.0
yeah that's that's it's weird but that

3018.76 --> 3022.0
is true

3031.88 --> 3038.119
doesn't account for optical

3035.2 --> 3042.0
drop

3038.119 --> 3047.1600000000003
what you mean that rate tracing

3042.0 --> 3051.28
doesn't naturally insert refraction

3047.16 --> 3051.2799999999997
effects through a homogeneous

3052.0 --> 3057.52

3054.119 --> 3060.359
thing I mean yeah Optics elaborate

3057.52 --> 3063.4
Optics are kind of complicated

3060.359 --> 3066.4
so I can't really help you there

3063.4 --> 3066.4

Sun couldn't set on a r Trace Flat

3129.68 --> 3134.7599999999998
Earth well it all depends look if you're

3133.4 --> 3137.599
in that

3134.76 --> 3140.599
system if you're going to have the Sun

3137.599 --> 3145.119
be an actual

3140.599 --> 3147.839
object an light emitting object yeah

3145.119 --> 3150.7200000000003
you're going to have troubles with it

3147.839 --> 3152.24
especially to try to make it look like

3150.72 --> 3156.359
the real

3152.24 --> 3156.359
world because in the real world it

3157.68 --> 3160.68
isn't

3161.079 --> 3164.88
so you'd have to

3165.88 --> 3172.0
use it as a backdrop as a background

3172.599 --> 3179.28
thing the celestial

3175.28 --> 3184.2400000000002
light and not be like an object that's

3179.28 --> 3184.2400000000002
in the ukian position over that flatter

3184.88 --> 3189.799
disc and then it'll probably work out a

3187.52 --> 3189.799
lot

3198.119 --> 3204.4
better right it's just just the angles

3201.68 --> 3206.96
just the angles to the backdrop it's

3204.4 --> 3212.119
like the sun would become part of the

3206.96 --> 3212.119
backdrop picture the background

3217.0 --> 3220.13
[Music]

3236.799 --> 3242.52
retracing probably would not account for

3239.28 --> 3244.6800000000003
standard refraction no it wouldn't it

3242.52 --> 3247.68
would never do

3244.68 --> 3249.44
that because standard refraction like

3247.68 --> 3253.0789999999997
doesn't

3249.44 --> 3256.079
exist like you can't

3253.079 --> 3260.319
calculate curved

3256.079 --> 3260.319
paths like that it doesn't

3261.319 --> 3266.48
work yeah actor refraction is angle

3264.799 --> 3269.88
changes

3266.48 --> 3269.88
when there's a a

3270.48 --> 3277.559
border of a median and that works you

3274.88 --> 3279.6800000000003
can do that in Ray tracing very

3277.559 --> 3281.7200000000003
effectively but like things like

3279.68 --> 3285.24
terrestrial refraction or standard

3281.72 --> 3289.48
refraction like that doesn't work

3285.24 --> 3293.8799999999997
because like Rays just like light don't

3289.48 --> 3293.88
bend doesn't work

3306.91 --> 3310.9289999999996
[Music]

3313.119 --> 3317.4
like there is no terrestrial refraction

3321.24 --> 3324.5989999999997

3328.039 --> 3331.599
you could probably do it in an

3329.4 --> 3333.92
orographic scenario

3331.599 --> 3336.3590000000004
but you're actually going to apply

3333.92 --> 3341.2000000000003
perspective I mean it's going to be way

3336.359 --> 3345.359
too hard I suspect although

3341.2 --> 3347.8799999999997
yeah I don't know maybe these days with

3345.359 --> 3349.52
the computers how strong they are you

3347.88 --> 3352.079
might be able to do that without

3349.52 --> 3352.079
breaking the

3352.16 --> 3359.16
computer but I mean logically it

3357.68 --> 3360.0
like how the hell are you going to make

3359.16 --> 3362.3999999999996
the

3360.0 --> 3365.92
Rays Bend like

3362.4 --> 3368.48
that then calculation I don't even know

3365.92 --> 3368.48
how that would

3369.319 --> 3376.839
work it would certainly slow things down

3372.52 --> 3376.839
dramatically I I suspect

3393.28 --> 3398.44
if it would yield any kind of cohesive

3395.559 --> 3401.28
image at all because I mean you got to

3398.44 --> 3404.2400000000002
realize that even with rate tracing

3401.28 --> 3407.599
like have

3404.24 --> 3410.319
a back and forth It's like light is

3407.599 --> 3413.2400000000002
going these rays are going all over the

3410.319 --> 3417.079
place back and forth but if it's like

3413.24 --> 3419.839
all bending somehow dude it's going to

3417.079 --> 3419.8390000000004
be a giant

3421.96 --> 3427.039
mess rate tracing is Globe Fancy

3427.48 --> 3434.559
no no it's a computer Graphics rendering

3438.359 --> 3443.0389999999998
clearly right and it's talking about

3441.16 --> 3445.3999999999996
trying to simulate terrestrial

3443.039 --> 3447.039
refraction using rate tracing like

3445.4 --> 3448.6800000000003
making it

3447.039 --> 3452.92
curved

3448.68 --> 3455.839
Rays uh it's going to be a gigantic mess

3452.92 --> 3459.6800000000003
it's probably going to like just like

3455.839 --> 3459.68
look completely

3461.28 --> 3466.079
distorted if you'd actually try to apply

3469.359 --> 3474.44
it like if these rays are now all

3471.88 --> 3477.319
bending I

3474.44 --> 3480.359
mean the good chance you simply won't

3477.319 --> 3482.7599999999998
see anything then at some

3480.359 --> 3484.0
point like how are you going to make the

3482.76 --> 3486.6400000000003
Rays

3484.0 --> 3489.72
Bend

3486.64 --> 3495.5589999999997
back what it's going to go like this and

3489.72 --> 3495.5589999999997
then curve right back like that really

3527.559 --> 3533.599
why would you was

3529.799 --> 3537.359
yeah why would you waste it I know I

3533.599 --> 3540.319
mean the actual refraction

3537.359 --> 3544.119
like even in the real world is like

3540.319 --> 3548.0
mostly admitted to be

3544.119 --> 3548.92
insignificant like not worth mentioning

3548.0 --> 3550.599
or

3548.92 --> 3555.2400000000002
calculating

3550.599 --> 3555.2400000000002
and practically imperceivable

3566.24 --> 3571.5989999999997
so yeah you wouldn't waste your CPU time

3568.799 --> 3574.319
to do that unless you got a real point

3571.599 --> 3574.319
to make with it

3591.28 --> 3598.76
all all right anyway think I'm going to

3593.92 --> 3598.76
get my coffee and I'll be right

3624.96 --> 3628.96
back for

3685.0 --> 3690.119
anyway

3687.48 --> 3692.22
yeah sorry guys for shouting earlier

it's just

3695.64 --> 3700.8799999999997

upgrading my computer it's just not not

3700.88 --> 3703.88
today

3717.0 --> 3721.16
although it is an interesting idea that

3718.88 --> 3723.6800000000003
I could just like find a big enough USB

3721.16 --> 3723.68
stick and

3724.319 --> 3730.96
then like run the computer from

3728.2 --> 3734.1189999999997
there but I'd much rather just have it

3730.96 --> 3737.92
internally with another

3734.119 --> 3742.119
SSD that it could just run parallel so

3737.92 --> 3742.119
that it could more easily switch

3845.52 --> 3849.48
okay that's interesting thir Cas yeah

3847.119 --> 3849.48
that makes

3851.119 --> 3858.88
sense does it also like apply defraction

3854.96 --> 3858.88
and all that within rate tracing I

3862.559 --> 3869.4
wonder cuz that is like a natural

3865.359 --> 3869.4
function of light it does do

3873.92 --> 3880.52
that but is defraction effects is that

3878.0 --> 3885.079
included in rate tracing I

3880.52 --> 3885.079
wonder I have no idea

3892.77 --> 3896.36
[Music]

3919.4 --> 3924.319
yeah remember those days Thor KC yeah

3921.76 --> 3928.6800000000003
rate tracing used to take a long long

3924.319 --> 3931.359
time I mean in the 90s I was rate

3928.68 --> 3933.1189999999997
tracing on my migga 1200 and that took

3931.359 --> 3935.7599999999998
like

3933.119 --> 3938.44
hours sometimes an entire day just to

3935.76 --> 3938.44
render one

3945.88 --> 3950.119

4422.12 --> 4425.719
weird it's been like that for like a

4424.679 --> 4427.96
year or

4425.719 --> 4430.96
more I don't even know how that's

4427.96 --> 4430.96

4471.48 --> 4478.32
can't really talk about things that I

4474.48 --> 4481.32
normally would like to talk about

4478.32 --> 4484.799999999999
there and why I mostly don't hang around

4481.32 --> 4489.32

4494.44 --> 4499.04
perfectly fine hang around there on a

daily basis talking [ __ ] about other

4499.04 --> 4503.0
people continually that's perfectly

4503.04 --> 4507.239
fine they just let let that

4511.32 --> 4519.159
happen right but me talking about

4515.88 --> 4522.0
controversial subjects controversial

4519.159 --> 4526.36
opinions that may not be strictly

4522.0 --> 4529.199
biblical Dogma well that's that's just

4526.36 --> 4532.239
that's too much that's when I need to be

4529.199 --> 4534.96
timed out and removed and all that and

I'm not going to deal with it they don't

4555.36 --> 4559.96
want to clean out the

4559.96 --> 4565.12
any part of it anymore I just don't want

Jabs like

4691.239 --> 4697.48

4719.48 --> 4725.678999999999

somehow they do that they literally go

4730.96 --> 4737.28
spying everywhere snooping and spying

4737.28 --> 4742.599999999999
don't think the Bible is actually of God

4740.08 --> 4744.719

4742.6 --> 4748.88

4744.719 --> 4752.4
basically a Catholic mind control

4748.88 --> 4755.400000000001

6395.8 --> 6406.52
girl and she literally said that

6400.04 --> 6406.5199999999995

somebody else's sex life even

6452.0 --> 6457.96

stop I should put more work in behind

7654.76 --> 7660.1990000000005
the scenes

7657.199 --> 7660.199
what

7665.119 --> 7668.88
how maybe have a

7668.96 --> 7676.96
topic all the time now I don't have 20

7671.88 --> 7679.639
minutes of silence all the time and I do

7676.96 --> 7683.599
eventually figure out topics I mean why

7679.639 --> 7685.84
don't you try to do a a Daily Show for

7683.599 --> 7687.88
like a decade and see how well you're

7685.84 --> 7692.04
going to do with finding subjects to

7687.88 --> 7692.04
talk about Richard G

7724.639 --> 7732.4400000000005
but could you just stop being so damn

7727.36 --> 7732.44
victim here did I call you a troll

7735.079 --> 7740.04
you don't do it for a reason and what is

7737.8 --> 7740.04
that

7740.4 --> 7746.598999999999
reason is it because I had i t I

7744.079 --> 7749.88
addressed you that there were people

7746.599 --> 7752.4400000000005
that have like that say like oh you're

7749.88 --> 7756.0
sympathizing with the Enemy which I was

7752.44 --> 7759.159
neutral in I just informed you should I

7756.0 --> 7762.159
just like completely not not say

7759.159 --> 7762.159
anything

7763.679 --> 7769.84
I mean I told them off I told them like

7766.44 --> 7769.839999999999
hey don't don't do

7777.96 --> 7783.52
that is it always like this no Lucy

7780.4 --> 7783.5199999999995
level it's never like

7784.639 --> 7790.119
this now today is the first it's like oh

7788.199 --> 7793.239
well everything is just completely out

7790.119 --> 7796.119
of control now but I mean if even thank

7793.239 --> 7798.36
Phi is going to pop up to say all that

7796.119 --> 7799.36
it's like oh no what I just did like to

7798.36 --> 7802.558999999999
be

7799.36 --> 7804.639
Resolute with the situation that's the

7802.559 --> 7807.559
reason why all that happened that's why

7804.639 --> 7810.599
they abandoned me which is like

7807.559 --> 7814.88
extremely demoralizing to me it's

7810.599 --> 7820.719
because I just don't let Richard G rant

7814.88 --> 7820.719
on and call me a hypocrite and all that

7824.159 --> 7828.36
cuz I'm the one being unreasonable here

7826.36 --> 7831.96
totally unreasonable I mean I've been

7828.36 --> 7834.0
just completely nasty

7831.96 --> 7839.36
today

7834.0 --> 7842.04
right been so nasty like how dare I be

7839.36 --> 7843.799999999999
Resolute when people just roll in out of

7842.04 --> 7846.8
nowhere and start cursing at other

7843.8 --> 7846.8
people

7866.76 --> 7872.079000000001
and Richard G really hates Lucy so okay

7870.0 --> 7873.59
fine

7872.079 --> 7876.679999999999
well

7873.59 --> 7876.68
[Music]

7877.48 --> 7883.718999999999
whatever Rich G hates you Lucy can't

7880.88 --> 7885.4400000000005
really help it but I mean he wants to do

7883.719 --> 7887.679
that so I'm just going to let you do

7885.44 --> 7890.96
that I mean apparently that's that's

7887.679 --> 7890.96
okay now

7912.159 --> 7918.239
I guess it's just a freefor all chat now

7915.28 --> 7920.5199999999995
I mean I've done it all wrong all this

7918.239 --> 7922.638999999999
time if people just want to talk [ __ ]

7920.52 --> 7927.360000000001
and just start infighting with one

7922.639 --> 7930.679
another then I just have to let them

7927.36 --> 7933.839999999999
now because apparently if I don't well

7930.679 --> 7936.52
then it's all bad and Arwin is so bad

7933.84 --> 7938.52
and I'm just doing terrible I don't

7936.52 --> 7941.1990000000005
deserve any support I don't deserve

7938.52 --> 7945.119000000001
anything if I don't just let people talk

7941.199 --> 7945.119
complete [ __ ] to one another in my

7950.0 --> 7954.32
chat you will stop now your point has

7952.52 --> 7956.4800000000005
been made I don't even know what the

7954.32 --> 7960.36
[ __ ] point you

7956.48 --> 7964.638999999999
had Richard G I don't know what the hell

7960.36 --> 7964.639
your supposed point was

7985.4 --> 7989.199
all I know is you [ __ ] hate Lucy you

7988.28 --> 7991.44
hate

7989.199 --> 7995.32
duper

7991.44 --> 7998.598999999999
and turns you around and into a person

7995.32 --> 8001.639
that's just nasty all of a sudden you

7998.599 --> 8003.559
didn't say anything for a week

8001.639 --> 8006.88
for some reason that you haven't

8003.559 --> 8006.88
clarified to me at

8010.199 --> 8016.36
all but your point has been made yeah

8013.36 --> 8016.36
sure sure it

8017.46 --> 8021.47
[Music]

8025.28 --> 8031.5199999999995
has whatever it is it's been made

8049.639 --> 8053.52
oh it's

8050.679 --> 8055.1990000000005
weird okay oh Richard G I didn't know

8053.52 --> 8057.92
you were like that I thought you were

8055.199 --> 8061.159
like this mellow guy that just like lets

8057.92 --> 8064.92
everything just roll past that's how I

8061.159 --> 8067.759999999999
used to you but apparently you have this

8064.92 --> 8067.76
other side to

8068.239 --> 8076.558999999999
you and uh yeah you shock me a little

8072.4 --> 8076.558999999999
but I guess that's just what you do

8076.8 --> 8082.559
then right maybe I have been too tight

8079.4 --> 8086.199
with you guys right

8082.559 --> 8089.4800000000005
maybe my idea to that I could like have

8086.199 --> 8092.5199999999995
a chat where everybody actually

8089.48 --> 8096.079
behaves maybe that was too much maybe

8092.52 --> 8097.8
it's just like no no the trolls win

8096.079 --> 8100.48
everybody's a [ __ ] troll now

8097.8 --> 8103.4800000000005
everybody's becoming a troll and I can't

8100.48 --> 8104.598999999999
stop it because I'm being attacked from

8103.48 --> 8109.079
all

8104.599 --> 8111.639
sides for not just letting people act

8109.079 --> 8115.119
kind of out of

8111.639 --> 8118.52
control in my chat so I guess that's how

8115.119 --> 8118.5199999999995
it is now

8124.76 --> 8132.52
you have another side lol Arwin you're

8127.44 --> 8132.5199999999995
Dr Jacko Mr Hyde oh yes of

8136.76 --> 8142.4400000000005
course hey and I'm fine with you having

8139.36 --> 8144.719
that side it's just that it's kind of a

8142.44 --> 8148.199
sudden it's kind of a bit sudden out

8144.719 --> 8151.159
don't knowwhere but I

8148.199 --> 8155.44
mean that's cool

8151.159 --> 8159.36
hey I'm sorry I I called you a a troll

8155.44 --> 8159.36
earlier I guess it's just

8161.4 --> 8164.4
feelings

8166.0 --> 8172.0
right Phil earlier confirmed it I mean I

8170.32 --> 8175.4
didn't think he was even watching

8172.0 --> 8177.599
anymore I thought they abandoned me yeah

8175.4 --> 8180.96
disconnecting all contact and everything

8177.599 --> 8184.679
but I apparently this behavior my

8180.96 --> 8188.44
attitude towards you Richard G was

8184.679 --> 8188.4400000000005
enough to Warrant another

8193.16 --> 8198.399
communication right so that's fine I

8195.399 --> 8201.439
guess that I have to give you guys some

8198.399 --> 8203.96
room to express your feelings even if

8201.439 --> 8206.319
those feelings are not very constructive

8203.96 --> 8209.559
I just have to let it

8206.319 --> 8212.84
happen so I guess that the chat policy

8209.559 --> 8212.84
is now changed

8213.519 --> 8218.92
it's not a workshop anymore it is just

8219.12 --> 8227.679
like like a social Gathering therapy

8223.04 --> 8227.679
room now I guess that's what it is

8233.28 --> 8239.399000000001
now I can't see hey Gary Fe you got

8237.0 --> 8242.319
anything productive to

8239.399 --> 8245.08
say everything you're saying thus far in

8242.319 --> 8248.039999999999
the last half hour is just how I'm not

8245.08 --> 8251.559
doing it right how I can't see

8248.04 --> 8255.599
it do you have anything to say that that

8251.559 --> 8257.279999999999
might like have any kind of constructive

8255.599 --> 8261.679
influence

8257.28 --> 8261.679
whatsoever Gary f

8279.399 --> 8282.199999999999
cuz I haven't been there for two days no

8281.12 --> 8286.08
not two

8282.2 --> 8286.08
days barely at

8297.8 --> 8303.559
all see overall overall severely

8308.12 --> 8312.0
reduced yeah and I'm

8312.359 --> 8317.479000000001
sorry I'm sorry that I acted that you

8315.04 --> 8319.76
were no longer my friend it's just I

8317.479 --> 8322.319
kind of thought that at the moment I

8319.76 --> 8324.24
kind of thought that because the way you

8322.319 --> 8328.559
basically roll into my

8324.24 --> 8331.479
chat I genuinely thought that yeah but

8328.559 --> 8332.92
even despite everything that happen

8331.479 --> 8335.88
right now

8332.92 --> 8340.92
everything which is like Way Beyond my

8335.88 --> 8343.598999999998
normal tolerance limit Way Beyond it I'm

8340.92 --> 8345.0
still willing to consider you to be my

8343.599 --> 8347.679
friend Richard

8345.0 --> 8350.399
G can you believe that I can barely

8347.679 --> 8353.679
believe it but it's

8350.399 --> 8356.319
true yeah I'm just going to consider

8353.679 --> 8358.599
that you may need it some venting room

8356.319 --> 8361.96
for all this and you couldn't do it any

8358.599 --> 8361.960000000001
other way

8374.519 --> 8382.16
listen to what the [ __ ] are you talking

8376.84 --> 8382.16
about Gary a seriously could you just

8388.12 --> 8392.640000000001

8402.56 --> 8407.96
oh I'm sure this all this oh yes I would

8405.96 --> 8411.599999999999
have nipped it in the butt if only I'd

8407.96 --> 8415.399
listened to Gary Fe three days ago what

8411.6 --> 8415.399000000001
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

8419.64 --> 8423.68
man for

8453.439 --> 8458.68
right and yeah richer G it's no problem

8455.76 --> 8461.0

8475.24 --> 8481.08
people have that issue been very

8479.12 --> 8483.12
understanding and I'm very glad that you

8481.08 --> 8486.0
were personally willing to communicate

8483.12 --> 8489.880000000001
with me about it I wish You' done so

8486.0 --> 8492.16
more elaborately so that perhaps you

8489.88 --> 8494.759999999998
could have like rolled out all this

8492.16 --> 8498.08
stuff not in

8494.76 --> 8498.08
public like

8499.16 --> 8504.56

8502.2 --> 8508.359
let it happen and it's out it's out here

8508.359 --> 8514.56
all Hassle and it's okay I'm I'm not

8511.88 --> 8515.96

about

8515.96 --> 8522.56
that I'm not even like Banning everybody

8519.6 --> 8526.6
which was probably would be my normal

8522.56 --> 8526.6
response to this kind of thing

8527.319 --> 8533.64
happening right but thank Phil for

8531.68 --> 8536.08
telling me that that's wrong and I just

8533.64 --> 8539.0
need to let everybody just completely

8536.08 --> 8540.88
vent and call me names and a hypocrite

8539.0 --> 8543.24
and all that and that's all fine because

8540.88 --> 8544.599999999999
they're still my friends and you can

8543.24 --> 8548.6
just do that

8544.6 --> 8551.960000000001

8575.399 --> 8580.358999999999
be a great what fibro what are you

8578.08 --> 8580.359
talking

wrenches only show up after the drama

8606.16 --> 8610.319

8608.16 --> 8614.0
correct

8610.319 --> 8618.039999999999
yeah it is that's very perceptive of

8614.0 --> 8621.76
you I mean I could be angry about it

8618.04 --> 8625.92
annoyed about it but I'm not because hey

8628.96 --> 8635.88
and I'm okay with it

8631.319 --> 8640.08
cuz this is just how things go now right

8635.88 --> 8642.119999999999
I mean it's not like well maybe this

8640.08 --> 8646.52
just seems like everybody's [ __ ]

8642.12 --> 8650.68
turning against me right but that that

8646.52 --> 8650.68
can't be it that that's not

8650.88 --> 8657.72

8654.64 --> 8659.96
hypocrite I've done it all wrong you

8657.72 --> 8662.358999999999
should just let people act like complete

8659.96 --> 8662.358999999999
Mania

8662.8 --> 8670.278999999999
right deal with the trolls all the time

8666.72 --> 8672.84
earlier in this show were like 20 trolls

8670.279 --> 8675.0
that I banned but I mean I'm the one

8672.84 --> 8677.08
doing it all wrong I'm just I'm just

8675.0 --> 8679.2
terrible I shouldn't be on the internet

8677.08 --> 8684.479
I mean you guys said so yourself why am

8679.2 --> 8684.479000000001
I here I should just like go away

8703.64 --> 8706.699999999999
[Music]

8713.319 --> 8716.319
right

8726.64 --> 8731.479
but I'm very glad that Richard G got

8728.72 --> 8731.479
that all off his

8742.359 --> 8749.640000000001
chest I guess I just have to deal with

8746.56 --> 8752.199999999999
that that's just how he works I didn't

8749.64 --> 8755.119999999999
know it cuz he never really showed that

8752.2 --> 8758.16
side in like a year or

8755.12 --> 8760.52
more he seemed to be like completely

8758.16 --> 8762.439
stoic he's like I thought Richard G is

8760.52 --> 8764.84
like the most stoic person I've ever

8762.439 --> 8766.68
come across on the internet so stoic

8764.84 --> 8769.64
that he'd just hang around complete

8766.68 --> 8771.92
troll [ __ ] without even

8769.64 --> 8774.08
flinching to the point where other

8771.92 --> 8776.24
people get nervous from perceiving that

8774.08 --> 8778.76
and trying to warn me like oh he's

8776.24 --> 8781.399
hanging with trolls right and then I

8778.76 --> 8785.0
have to like deal with it and

8781.399 --> 8786.88
but I mean even just asking him about it

8785.0 --> 8789.68
would piss him

8786.88 --> 8791.759999999998

right now I'm sorry Richard G not

8893.68 --> 8900.68
everything that I talk about is about

8896.92 --> 8904.76
you you understand that that that I was

8900.68 --> 8907.92

you I don't care I don't care that

8916.2 --> 8922.560000000001
conversation I didn't see it as

8919.52 --> 8925.0
malignant you understand Richard G I

8922.56 --> 8928.0
didn't think that those stupid

8925.0 --> 8930.68
screenshots that they sent

8928.0 --> 8933.52
me that they were malignant I just

8930.68 --> 8936.84
thought like this is annoying like who

8933.52 --> 8936.84
gives a [ __ ] about

8938.0 --> 8943.64
that like Orwin is a wizard and you

8940.68 --> 8946.24
laugh at it and I'm like yeah why not

8943.64 --> 8949.599999999999
laugh at it like that doesn't mean

8946.24 --> 8953.039999999999
anything yeah but you seem to like not

8949.6 --> 8956.52
care you seem to not care that I'm

8953.04 --> 8960.640000000001
actually have been siding with you every

8956.52 --> 8963.0
single [ __ ] time yeah my only problem

8960.64 --> 8965.88
is is that I find it annoying that

8963.0 --> 8969.0
people keep doing that and sending me

8965.88 --> 8971.08
this stuff about you like you're some

8969.0 --> 8973.56
kind of troll when I don't think you're

8971.08 --> 8975.92
some kind of troll I'm annoyed with

8973.56 --> 8978.359
those people and I'm like just sharing

8975.92 --> 8982.399
with you out of

8978.359 --> 8983.960000000001
honesty yeah did I tell you not to do

8982.399 --> 8986.92
it

8983.96 --> 8990.119999999999
anybody did I tell Richard G not to do

8986.92 --> 8990.12
that anymore

8990.319 --> 8994.88
no no I didn't tell him not to do it

9014.359 --> 9018.319
anymore what are you talking

9018.64 --> 9023.039999999999
about I have scared off star water slow

9022.04 --> 9025.319000000001
I don't know what the hell you're

9023.04 --> 9025.319000000001
talking

9044.84 --> 9051.92
about but I make it clear it bugs you

9047.8 --> 9051.92
there's an underlying impli I don't know

9052.8 --> 9058.319
G it's fine you want to hang around them

9056.0 --> 9058.319
that's

9058.72 --> 9064.8
fine I don't mind I

9061.6 --> 9068.24
just it's only Annoying that I just get

9064.8 --> 9070.72
emails and all that [ __ ] about it but I

9068.24 --> 9075.76
already told duper don't do that

9070.72 --> 9075.76
anymore he hasn't done it since

9099.12 --> 9104.52
did I call seeking starwater an idiot

9102.24 --> 9104.52
for

9105.399 --> 9110.96
that well if I did seeking star water

9108.439 --> 9115.12
I'm very sorry I mean

9110.96 --> 9118.56
it I didn't directly mean you as a

9115.12 --> 9122.68
person being an idiot and I think I did

9118.56 --> 9124.68
clarify also about that like I

9122.68 --> 9125.76
understand that there's something there

9124.68 --> 9128.800000000001
that you

9125.76 --> 9132.64
think is there and that you might call

9128.8 --> 9134.679999999998
Ether it's just that the physics idea of

9132.64 --> 9136.68
ether being a light

9134.68 --> 9141.84
medium that's

9136.68 --> 9145.56
stupid and you shouldn't do that

9141.84 --> 9148.399
like it's not necessary right but I mean

9145.56 --> 9152.119999999999
I'm really sorry if I if I hurt your

9148.399 --> 9154.92
feelings with that I genuinely mean

9152.12 --> 9158.960000000001
that I'm sorry seeking star water it's

9154.92 --> 9158.960000000001
just that it's

9177.92 --> 9181.12
so yeah anything

9185.24 --> 9193.68

9307.12 --> 9314.0
I'm done giving you

9309.08 --> 9314.0
advice advice about what

9325.16 --> 9331.52
I'm sorry Gary Effy I'm really

9328.399 --> 9334.64
sorry thank you for all the advice I'm

9331.52 --> 9338.399000000001
so thankful for for all the Fantastical

9334.64 --> 9341.68
advice I mean yeah I'm such a bastard

9338.399 --> 9344.358999999999
man I can be so rude to

9341.68 --> 9347.92
people like how dare I call them a

9344.359 --> 9350.359
[ __ ] for holding on to an idea that's

9347.92 --> 9354.0
like blatantly out outdated and

9350.359 --> 9355.319
Superfluous and can be argued against in

9354.0 --> 9358.279
every

9355.319 --> 9361.479
detail for example even though I really

9358.279 --> 9363.640000000001
like the person as a person I definitely

9361.479 --> 9368.039999999999
want to see sing star water

9363.64 --> 9373.08
back although I doubt that she'd come in

9368.04 --> 9373.080000000002
an environment like that's like this

9384.12 --> 9389.52
yeah Lucy level I mean yeah Richard G

9386.52 --> 9392.24
got really triggered from you having

9389.52 --> 9394.960000000001
some kind of sexual reference to

9392.24 --> 9397.64
Paula talking about that I mean

9394.96 --> 9399.88
apparently that's just like super

9397.64 --> 9402.439
triggering like I didn't see it like

9399.88 --> 9405.839999999998
that I I didn't think it was like in

9402.439 --> 9408.92
Good Taste necessarily but I mean not

9405.84 --> 9410.64
enough to like oh wow kick you out

9408.92 --> 9412.72
immediately

9410.64 --> 9414.519999999999
right and especially now because now

9412.72 --> 9415.96
people could just say whatever the [ __ ]

9414.52 --> 9421.24
they want

9415.96 --> 9424.438999999998
apparently there is no more standard

9421.24 --> 9430.64
now because trying to uphold a standard

9424.439 --> 9430.64
is what made thank Phil abandon

9431.92 --> 9440.76
me just being angry and like

9436.68 --> 9444.76
oh dealing with my friends

9440.76 --> 9444.76
incorrectly trying to uphold a

9454.319 --> 9459.119999999999
standard all right but hey I'm being

9457.56 --> 9461.8
very tolerant

9459.12 --> 9464.240000000002
now and I hope I've been kind of

9461.8 --> 9467.8
amicable despite the situation where

9464.24 --> 9471.439
normally I'd get pretty [ __ ] pissed

9467.8 --> 9471.438999999998
off overall this

9472.04 --> 9478.6
happening but I guess that sometimes you

9474.76 --> 9482.04
just have to let people just say nasty

9478.6 --> 9483.960000000001
[ __ ] about you and get away with it let

9482.04 --> 9487.640000000001
them get away with it I just have to do

9483.96 --> 9489.72
that because it's really important it's

9487.64 --> 9493.199999999999
just really important apparently that's

9489.72 --> 9493.199999999999
part of normal friendship

9494.56 --> 9499.6
behavior and I really deserved it

9497.16 --> 9502.72
somehow I mean

9499.6 --> 9504.6
like to know how exactly how I really

9502.72 --> 9508.599999999999
deserved all

9504.6 --> 9508.6
this but apparently I

9523.8 --> 9527.679999999998
did yeah Lucy I

9527.92 --> 9531.439
know just

9532.96 --> 9541.08
so overgeneralized statement I'm not

9535.96 --> 9541.08
accusing you of anything it's all fine

9569.16 --> 9573.72
right I really by the way hope to see

9571.84 --> 9576.359
slow-mo moon buggy back I mean I don't

9573.72 --> 9576.358999999999
know why the

9578.2 --> 9581.2
hell

9581.279 --> 9587.84
okay oh yes yeah you go and INF fight

9585.359 --> 9590.08
together then I'll stay out of it okay

9587.84 --> 9592.24
you go bicker about that in my chat

9590.08 --> 9594.0
because it's okay to bicker in my chat

9592.24 --> 9597.52
now these

9594.0 --> 9601.08
days that's just

9597.52 --> 9603.399000000001
fine but uh yeah I really hope to see

9601.08 --> 9605.52
slow-mo moon buggy back really

9603.399 --> 9607.519999999999
considered him like a

9605.52 --> 9610.84
friend very

9607.52 --> 9612.439
valuable friend that I really enjoyed

9610.84 --> 9616.24
having him in

9612.439 --> 9618.24
chat and maybe I said some things that

9616.24 --> 9621.68
rubbed him the wrong way but he's never

9618.24 --> 9621.68
actually addressed me about

9624.52 --> 9631.279
it

9626.64 --> 9634.0
what admitting I'm wrong okay I'm wrong

9631.279 --> 9636.399000000001
and I think I've got my emotions under

9634.0 --> 9639.24
control so I'm wrong I don't know

9636.399 --> 9642.479
exactly about what I'm wrong but you're

9639.24 --> 9646.359
right thank Phil I am wrong I admit it I

9642.479 --> 9648.84
was completely wrong about

9646.359 --> 9651.84
something and I really regret it and I

9648.84 --> 9654.399
want to correct my

9651.84 --> 9657.76
incorrectness and

9654.399 --> 9660.24
uh yeah it's

9657.76 --> 9662.92
cool but you're

9660.24 --> 9666.319
right I admit I was

9662.92 --> 9668.52
wrong about something I don't know what

9666.319 --> 9671.68
exactly but yeah I've been wrong and

9668.52 --> 9674.720000000001
I'll probably be wrong again and I'll be

9671.68 --> 9677.84
very very willing to admit it and I

9674.72 --> 9681.199999999999
won't be emotional about it at all I try

9677.84 --> 9683.359
not to be so yeah I mean as soon as you

9681.2 --> 9686.0
could just point out exactly how I was

9683.359 --> 9688.479000000001
wrong that's cool or maybe I was wrong

9686.0 --> 9690.439
about Richard G being a troll I

9688.479 --> 9692.519999999999
genuinely thought in that moment that he

9690.439 --> 9696.16
was I really thought

9692.52 --> 9699.880000000001
that yeah so I wasn't lying about it I

9696.16 --> 9703.8
was just apparently Incorrect and the

9699.88 --> 9707.599999999999
way that I have this show that I

9703.8 --> 9710.358999999999
uphold the rules here didn't work

9707.6 --> 9713.04
properly in order to to maintain a

9710.359 --> 9716.2
friendship with some people in the

9713.04 --> 9719.439
chat and so I had to basically break all

9716.2 --> 9720.92
of that apart in favor of trying to

9719.439 --> 9723.279
restore the

9720.92 --> 9726.399
friendship which I did and it's exactly

9723.279 --> 9729.2
what I did and yeah the way I had my

9726.399 --> 9731.8
show the way I thought of people was

9729.2 --> 9735.479000000001
wrong I totally agree I was wrong I'm

9731.8 --> 9738.84
wrong a lot guys I Wrong a

9735.479 --> 9741.16
lot sometimes I think I'm like wrong 50%

9738.84 --> 9741.16
of the

9741.92 --> 9749.399
times and it's a miracle that I even get

9746.16 --> 9749.399
some things correct at

9752.72 --> 9757.399
all I really am a lost

9755.479 --> 9762.039999999999
cause

9757.399 --> 9762.039999999999
okay maybe Gary F maybe I

9762.279 --> 9767.92
am you just don't care to see trolls

9765.2 --> 9770.359
talk about old women's sex lives yeah

9767.92 --> 9772.279
well I don't care either

9770.359 --> 9774.6
I don't care to talk about it either and

9772.279 --> 9776.640000000001
that's why I kind of like ignored it so

9774.6 --> 9780.92
that could move

9776.64 --> 9783.479
on and not bring it back up by keep

9780.92 --> 9786.479
repeating it over and over and over

9783.479 --> 9786.479
again

9799.76 --> 9803.6
right and I think I'm controlling my

9801.319 --> 9806.76
emotions pretty well right now I

9803.6 --> 9809.479000000001
mean this is all very frustrating and I

9806.76 --> 9811.84
feel like I do not have control at all

9809.479 --> 9814.88
about the entire

9811.84 --> 9818.2
situation but at the same time I'm like

9814.88 --> 9822.438999999998
yeah okay well if I have lost control

9818.2 --> 9825.08
then then just so be it right I mean

9822.439 --> 9827.319
what are you going to do what could I do

9825.08 --> 9831.0
about it absolutely nothing there's

9827.319 --> 9833.72
absolutely nothing I can do about this

9831.0 --> 9836.439
whatsoever pretty much everybody seems

9833.72 --> 9838.399
to be turning against me they're just

9836.439 --> 9839.64
all everybody's convinced I've done

9838.399 --> 9842.56
everything

9839.64 --> 9845.96
wrong and well maybe they're right maybe

9842.56 --> 9845.96
I have done everything

9846.12 --> 9852.479000000001
wrong the ideas that I had and like how

9849.479 --> 9854.119999999999
I tried to do things I guess it was just

9852.479 --> 9856.88
wrong I was just

9854.12 --> 9859.12
Incorrect and I shouldn't do it anymore

9856.88 --> 9860.88
like that I shouldn't respond like that

9859.12 --> 9864.76
to people in my

9860.88 --> 9867.72
chat I shouldn't have this

9864.76 --> 9870.960000000001
format I shouldn't be expecting anything

9867.72 --> 9875.119999999999
from anybody in my

9870.96 --> 9878.399
chat and just let them say whatever the

9875.12 --> 9882.12
[ __ ] they want in whatever way they want

9878.399 --> 9884.56
and bicker back and forth without any

9882.12 --> 9886.84
objection cuz that's just how things

9884.56 --> 9889.72
happen now it's apparently it's

9886.84 --> 9892.399
necessary everybody seems to agree

9889.72 --> 9895.519999999999
that I was wrong about everything so

9892.399 --> 9895.519999999999
this is how it's going to be

9896.439 --> 9902.24
now what a mess yeah well hey you're not

9899.64 --> 9903.88
informing me I'm such a mess Gary I'm

9902.24 --> 9906.199999999999
such a mess you're totally right I'm

9903.88 --> 9907.92
such a mess but yeah if you're not going

9906.2 --> 9909.92
to tell me then I'm not going to figure

9907.92 --> 9914.04
it out

9909.92 --> 9917.319
right so you could just keep doing

9914.04 --> 9920.960000000001
that just keep emphasizing how shitty I

9917.319 --> 9920.96
am how terrible I am

9921.24 --> 9926.279
that's

9922.52 --> 9930.439
fine but I mean yeah it's not going to

9926.279 --> 9930.439
help anything if you just keep saying

9935.16 --> 9940.039999999999
that I shouldn't apologize if I don't

9937.92 --> 9941.76
know what for yeah but it's necessary

9940.04 --> 9944.560000000001
Frank sometimes you just need to

9941.76 --> 9948.04
apologize for something even if you

9944.56 --> 9950.359
don't know what it was that I did wrong

9948.04 --> 9953.880000000001
right because I do do things wrong

9950.359 --> 9955.720000000001
sometimes and then just because I don't

9953.88 --> 9959.0
understand exactly what I did wrong

9955.72 --> 9959.0
doesn't mean that it shouldn't

9960.16 --> 9965.92
apologize right I mean it's very helpful

9962.52 --> 9971.319000000001
if I afterward get to find out exactly

9965.92 --> 9973.92
what I did wrong but I mean it's not a

9971.319 --> 9975.76
prerequisite anymore apparently it's

9973.92 --> 9977.72
that's not how you're supposed to do

9975.76 --> 9980.52
thing that's not the right way of

9977.72 --> 9983.399
communication I was wrong in thinking

9980.52 --> 9989.479000000001
that cuz everybody agrees that I was

9983.399 --> 9989.479
wrong about that now don't you

9993.359 --> 9998.720000000001
guys I could have Listen to You 3 days

9996.16 --> 10000.88
ago yeah well you keep saying

9998.72 --> 10003.358999999999
that I don't know what the hell you're

10000.88 --> 10005.479
talking about though I wonder if you

10003.359 --> 10007.6
know what the hell you're talking about

10005.479 --> 10010.96
at this

10007.6 --> 10015.880000000001
point cuz just keep mentioning a time

10010.96 --> 10015.88
period without any in content

10028.8 --> 10033.92
so come across insincere if you

10031.72 --> 10036.8
apologize for something oh

10033.92 --> 10040.68
okay well I'm sorry I didn't mean to

10036.8 --> 10040.679999999998
come across insincerely

10041.56 --> 10047.199999999999
I am sorry I'm I feel very sorry that's

10045.04 --> 10048.720000000001
not insincere just because I don't know

10047.2 --> 10051.0
what I'm supposed to be sorry for

10048.72 --> 10053.16
doesn't mean that I don't feel sorry I

10051.0 --> 10054.56
do feel sorry I feel sorry for this

10053.16 --> 10056.6
entire [ __ ]

10054.56 --> 10059.039999999999
situation

10056.6 --> 10063.0
everything CU apparently I've done so

10059.04 --> 10065.720000000001
much wrong for so long and it's broken

10063.0 --> 10068.12
it's all broken I'm effectively broken

10065.72 --> 10071.119999999999
right now I've been emotionally broken

10068.12 --> 10073.84
for quite a while while as I've shared

10071.12 --> 10076.319000000001
I've gone through a very rough time very

10073.84 --> 10080.960000000001
rough with

10076.319 --> 10082.72
like anguish on a daily basis yeah

10080.96 --> 10084.599999999999
nobody cares about that though not

10082.72 --> 10085.96
really they don't want to hear about it

10084.6 --> 10088.439
you don't want to hear about that but I

10085.96 --> 10091.08
mean it's made things difficult

10088.439 --> 10093.439
and and the Energy's just been

10091.08 --> 10096.08
relatively low the chat's not flowing

10093.439 --> 10100.12
and apparently I had to just like throw

10096.08 --> 10102.319
it all overboard just just boom just

10100.12 --> 10105.08
destroy everything everything that I've

10102.319 --> 10107.0
built just throw it all around and now

10105.08 --> 10110.96
things are flowing in the chat look it

10107.0 --> 10113.56
oh there's chat activity there's chat

10110.96 --> 10116.278999999999
activity so apparently I did the right

10113.56 --> 10119.72
thing doing that I did the right thing

10116.279 --> 10122.08
just like throwing it all overboard just

10119.72 --> 10124.119999999999
unconditionally apologizing I've done

10122.08 --> 10126.84
everything wrong a lot of things I have

10124.12 --> 10129.6
done wrong and I am genuinely sorry I

10126.84 --> 10130.68
never meant to do things wrong

10129.6 --> 10134.04
but I

10130.68 --> 10137.720000000001
have and I want to correct

10134.04 --> 10139.960000000001
it and apparently there's a lot of room

10137.72 --> 10141.56
needed for people to just do whatever

10139.96 --> 10144.319
they want in my

10141.56 --> 10146.199999999999
chat and so I'll give it to them you

10144.319 --> 10148.0
just can do whatever you want in my room

10146.2 --> 10150.04
in my chat now and you can just bicker

10148.0 --> 10155.279
back and forth and

10150.04 --> 10155.279
argue that's allowed now you can just do

10156.56 --> 10163.039999999999
that cuz it doesn't really matter

10158.8 --> 10163.039999999999
anymore if there's order in my chat or

10164.399 --> 10169.72
anything apparently people don't really

10166.76 --> 10171.479
care anymore it's it's not turned out to

10169.72 --> 10174.56
be as as

10171.479 --> 10177.84
effective to uphold that as I had hoped

10174.56 --> 10179.88
as I had thought I had

10177.84 --> 10181.76
envisioned apparently it's just more

10179.88 --> 10185.759999999998
important that people can just have the

10181.76 --> 10191.16
freedom and just do whatever they

10185.76 --> 10191.16
like so that's how it's going to be

10194.04 --> 10199.2
now all right anybody else need an

10196.439 --> 10203.84
apology I mean I know I've like done a

10199.2 --> 10206.479000000001
lot of things terribly wrong terribly so

10203.84 --> 10210.239
if you're an outsider you want to show

10206.479 --> 10213.399
up and just tell me to apologize I'll do

10210.239 --> 10213.399
it I'm

10214.04 --> 10219.52

10216.76 --> 10222.6

10219.52 --> 10225.479000000001
opportunity to say hello and I will

10222.6 --> 10229.2
apologize for all the terrible terrible

10225.479 --> 10229.199999999999
things that I have done

10253.96 --> 10257.16
I mispronounced your name the first

10255.84 --> 10261.439

10257.16 --> 10265.0

10287.84 --> 10294.6

10292.04 --> 10294.6
human

10296.6 --> 10301.880000000001
being

10298.359 --> 10301.880000000001
instruction what

10303.399 --> 10310.439

10306.239 --> 10315.68

10310.439 --> 10315.68
Harden be a man what the [ __ ] does that

10316.56 --> 10323.16
mean how am I acting like a spoiled do

10319.76 --> 10326.0
spoiled child children always like

10323.16 --> 10326.0
genuinely

10326.08 --> 10332.12
apologize you think this is all sarcasm

10328.76 --> 10332.12
it isn't it is not

10333.04 --> 10338.560000000001
sarcasm and I don't know exactly what I

10335.92 --> 10340.64
should be hardening for I'm I'm just

10338.56 --> 10343.119999999999
trying to address everything all the

10340.64 --> 10345.84
Grievances I'm being real

10343.12 --> 10349.160000000002
here and I'm genuinely admitting I've

10345.84 --> 10352.439
done things wrong I've managed things

10349.16 --> 10355.039999999999
incorrectly I had a plan it didn't work

10352.439 --> 10357.399
it's not working and I'm willing to

10355.04 --> 10360.800000000001
correct it I'm willing to reshape the

10357.399 --> 10364.76
way the show is willing to reshape the

10360.8 --> 10369.759999999998
way that I am in order

10364.76 --> 10369.76
to bring back the life

10370.2 --> 10374.08
so I don't know what the hell you're

10372.16 --> 10378.359
talking about thank

10374.08 --> 10381.479
Phil but maybe if you genuinely

10378.359 --> 10387.56
mean a real communication you should

10381.479 --> 10391.16
just like pick up contact again on Skype

10387.56 --> 10391.16
and stop being so damn

10392.68 --> 10395.68
vague

10395.84 --> 10400.2
yeah so I don't know what the hell

10398.64 --> 10403.119999999999
you're talking

10400.2 --> 10407.08
about cuz I am being a

10403.12 --> 10410.76
man I am being a man right now yeah if I

10407.08 --> 10414.399
weren't I'd literally kick all of you

10410.76 --> 10417.12
out pretend like it never happened and

10414.399 --> 10419.519999999999
then see if some show happens with a lot

10417.12 --> 10421.52
of Silent space in the chat and then I'd

10419.52 --> 10423.640000000001
round out like nothing ever happened and

10421.52 --> 10425.52
start the back show back up tomorrow

10423.64 --> 10428.88
like nothing ever happened I'm not doing

10425.52 --> 10432.640000000001
that I've addressed everything I've

10428.88 --> 10434.96
I've been very open I'm I'm like willing

10432.64 --> 10437.84
to commit serious

10434.96 --> 10440.839999999998
apologies and I willing to admit my

10437.84 --> 10445.56
wrongdoings and do my best to correct it

10440.84 --> 10445.56
I don't see how I haven't been a

10445.96 --> 10450.679999999998
man

10447.479 --> 10454.599999999999
yeah and I don't have never heard of a

10450.68 --> 10456.399
spoiled child that has acted this way

10454.6 --> 10459.960000000001
that would say all these things and mean

10456.399 --> 10463.358999999999
it and like really act upon what they're

10459.96 --> 10466.16
saying which is what I'm doing

10463.359 --> 10468.359
so I think you got it wrong I don't know

10466.16 --> 10470.96
what the hell you're talking about but

10468.359 --> 10473.56
doesn't seem like you're understanding

10470.96 --> 10476.358999999999
what's going on

10473.56 --> 10480.08
here all

10476.359 --> 10485.04
right so yeah Richard G's got his

10480.08 --> 10485.039999999999
room he's said his peace and that's

10485.239 --> 10490.319
cool I'm cool with it I'm cool with him

10488.72 --> 10492.64
I mean I didn't like that this all

10490.319 --> 10495.56
happened but apparently it's necessary

10492.64 --> 10495.56
for all that to

10495.92 --> 10499.92
happen I'm even like willing to give him

10498.319 --> 10503.278999999999
his wrench back I mean why not it

10499.92 --> 10505.64
doesn't really matter anyway at this

10503.279 --> 10507.76
point it's fine I'll just give him a

10505.64 --> 10510.199999999999
wrench back I mean he didn't really want

10507.76 --> 10514.800000000001
it but I mean he could use it again if

10510.2 --> 10516.319000000001
he wants to right so that's all cool so

10514.8 --> 10520.319
he's got his wrench

10516.319 --> 10520.319
back and we'll see what happens

10530.6 --> 10534.880000000001
happens if you are then calling us

10533.16 --> 10538.039999999999
idiots for not agreeing reading our

10534.88 --> 10538.039999999999
comments in a snarky

10538.84 --> 10545.399
way you're talking to me right now flut

10542.76 --> 10545.399
cuz you're

10546.6 --> 10552.16
right I should be more careful with

10550.319 --> 10554.359
addressing

10552.16 --> 10558.6
people's

10554.359 --> 10561.68
opinions I should be I need to be more I

10558.6 --> 10564.52
I genuinely mean it you're

10561.68 --> 10567.359
right reading it in a snarky way I mean

10564.52 --> 10567.359
it is sometimes

10568.16 --> 10574.399
for for comedic purposes

10571.6 --> 10577.84
also like especially if it's like a

10574.399 --> 10579.8
baller a baller comment then I I do like

10577.84 --> 10583.239
to do that I mean I think that some

10579.8 --> 10586.08
people actually find that quite

10583.239 --> 10589.76
amusing and to stop lying about my hair

10586.08 --> 10595.16
what lies there's no lies about my

10589.76 --> 10598.68
hair and no no no that's still going to

10595.16 --> 10600.92
make me ban you like if you just hear

10598.68 --> 10603.880000000001
about

10600.92 --> 10608.2
nonsense like there's my hair is not a

10603.88 --> 10608.199999999999
subject that's going to be talked about

10612.439 --> 10616.92
just get [ __ ] out and clear the air yeah

10614.439 --> 10616.92
exactly

10617.359 --> 10621.479000000001
clutch and that's happening right

10623.319 --> 10628.16
now that's

10625.52 --> 10630.2
cool I'm in a way I'm glad that this is

10628.16 --> 10633.52
happening because now it's just cleared

10630.2 --> 10635.6
up and I hope people really think that

10633.52 --> 10637.84
I'm I'm not trying to be disingenuous

10635.6 --> 10641.279
I'm not being sarcastic at all like I

10637.84 --> 10645.84
really am not I am being straightforward

10641.279 --> 10648.239
right now yeah I feel humiliated I feel

10645.84 --> 10650.84
humiliated by everything that's just

10648.239 --> 10654.399
happened but it's like yeah I'm going to

10650.84 --> 10656.76
go with it I'm going to because I care

10654.399 --> 10661.278999999999
about this show I care about the people

10656.76 --> 10663.479
that have been with me on this show and

10661.279 --> 10665.68
I realize

10663.479 --> 10669.08
that the way that

10665.68 --> 10673.84
I've acted on this show has like rub

10669.08 --> 10676.68
people the wrong way been too harsh in

10673.84 --> 10677.880000000001
ways not flexible enough and I need to

10676.68 --> 10682.880000000001
fix

10677.88 --> 10686.72
that this is not a bluff I genuinely

10682.88 --> 10688.96
need to and want to fix that to be more

10686.72 --> 10692.16
Dynamic to give more room to other

10688.96 --> 10692.16
people's feelings and

10692.239 --> 10701.239
opinions right and I will do my best

10698.52 --> 10704.0
it feels dismissive depending yes I

10701.239 --> 10704.0
realize that

10709.04 --> 10712.04
clutch

10718.52 --> 10723.359
yeah thank you I appreciate

10726.6 --> 10733.239
that that I have to like give a backdrop

10730.399 --> 10736.199999999999
explanation though it's it's very hard

10733.239 --> 10739.08
for me to to deal

10736.2 --> 10741.800000000001
with people that just have

10739.08 --> 10744.84
completely contrasting opinions about

10741.8 --> 10748.239
things it's very tough on me because I'm

10744.84 --> 10750.479
coming from a flat Earth debate T style

10748.239 --> 10753.279
discipline where people really there's

10750.479 --> 10756.519999999999
not a lot of room to have your own

10753.279 --> 10758.16
opinions it's not an exag is really like

10756.52 --> 10760.319000000001
that

10758.16 --> 10765.239
and

10760.319 --> 10768.88
so division in opinion is like consider

10765.239 --> 10771.479
the weakness that that's what it's like

10768.88 --> 10775.92
or what it was

10771.479 --> 10778.76
like and I need to get over

10775.92 --> 10781.439
that I've been trying to get over it

10778.76 --> 10785.359
step by step but it's a hard habit to

10781.439 --> 10785.359
get completely rid of it's very

10787.04 --> 10791.0
tough for

10814.63 --> 10817.65
[Music]

10820.57 --> 10825.789999999999
[Music]

10845.56 --> 10850.8
all right so I need to figure out to how

10848.96 --> 10853.8
to

10850.8 --> 10855.64
basically compartmentalize dealing with

10853.8 --> 10858.64
people that kind of just want to joke

10855.64 --> 10862.039999999999
around and people that are serious and

10858.64 --> 10864.16
see deal with it somehow it's tough It's

10862.04 --> 10866.479000000001
going to be a new way of dealing with it

10864.16 --> 10866.479
with the

10869.56 --> 10877.119999999999
chat and well at least there will be

10872.239 --> 10877.119999999999
just some activity that's something

10879.08 --> 10884.039999999999
cuz inactivity has been a bit of a

10886.399 --> 10892.88
problem wow I can't believe this like

10888.72 --> 10892.88
lasted three hours already

10917.64 --> 10922.599999999999
right I'm going to take a few minute

10926.08 --> 10934.08
break I'll be right back and yeah

10929.239 --> 10934.08
hopefully if anybody else here has some

10934.6 --> 10940.68
grievances let me know and I'll try to

10937.279 --> 10943.640000000001
address it as as honestly as I

10940.68 --> 10945.720000000001
can at least I feel a little better

10943.64 --> 10949.72
don't forget to rogans it up especially

10945.72 --> 10952.358999999999
if you really like the episodes where

10949.72 --> 10955.519999999999
everything just goes to chaos and all

10952.359 --> 10959.0
that you like that well this is the show

10955.52 --> 10962.560000000001
for you I'm sure it's going to have a

10959.0 --> 10966.16
lot of troll videos that reference

10962.56 --> 10966.16
this be right

10966.84 --> 10969.84
back

10996.76 --> 10999.76
for

11026.72 --> 11029.72
e

11056.72 --> 11060.679999999998
for for

11129.12 --> 11131.6
and I'm

11134.84 --> 11138.08
back all

11145.439 --> 11149.439
right okay

11153.8 --> 11156.119999999999
let's

11175.68 --> 11180.12
see yeah I still don't know what the

11177.84 --> 11183.399
hell happened 3 days ago Gary Fe hasn't

11180.12 --> 11185.560000000001
really addressed anything just says oh

11183.399 --> 11188.72
man if I had only listened to Gary 3

11185.56 --> 11191.16
days ago I could have avoided all of

11188.72 --> 11194.479
this it could have been so much better

11191.16 --> 11196.119999999999
if I only knew what the hell Gary Fe was

11194.479 --> 11199.56
talking about three days ago but he

11196.12 --> 11204.12
refuses to share that with me

11199.56 --> 11207.92
so so do you like

11204.12 --> 11211.84
stuff yeah I like stuff of course I like

11207.92 --> 11211.84
stuff who doesn't like stuff I

11211.92 --> 11221.08
mean stuff that's everything is stuff so

11216.56 --> 11221.08
how couldn't you like stuff

11261.96 --> 11267.519999999999
right I'm certainly like all energetic

11264.72 --> 11269.278999999999
and all that and I'm a bit hungry though

11267.52 --> 11272.720000000001
I'm almost like maybe I could just like

11269.279 --> 11276.04
make lunch and just continue the show

11272.72 --> 11276.039999999999
for another hour or

11276.56 --> 11283.399
something oh Simpsons joke oh okay I

11279.64 --> 11286.08
didn't recognize it I'm not thoroughly

11283.399 --> 11288.8
familiar with everything the S has ever

11286.08 --> 11291.039999999999
been said in The Simpsons except for

11288.8 --> 11294.88
it's just a bunch of stuff that happens

11291.04 --> 11294.880000000001
that I mean that one is going to

11294.96 --> 11300.96
always be remembered but other than that

11298.52 --> 11303.800000000001
not so

11300.96 --> 11305.479
much get people talking and lighten the

11303.8 --> 11309.08
yeah but maybe it's not time to lighten

11305.479 --> 11313.039999999999
the mood yet clutch I mean I genuinely

11309.08 --> 11315.279
want more people to to get in here and

11313.04 --> 11317.52
like I want you to feel safe to share

11315.279 --> 11317.52
your

11319.239 --> 11327.72
grievances I mean you want an

11324.08 --> 11330.84
apology for my behavior we and have had

11327.72 --> 11336.039999999999
a lot of behavior that's been very rough

11330.84 --> 11339.56
on people I know it is it's not I'm not

11336.04 --> 11342.76
cocking I'm not being sarcastic I

11339.56 --> 11349.199999999999
know I know that's

11342.76 --> 11351.399
real I have a relatively difficult

11349.2 --> 11355.720000000001
personality

11351.399 --> 11359.08
and if you if I hurt you in any way or

11355.72 --> 11362.479
it's just been tough on you interacting

11359.08 --> 11366.16
with me I want you to let me know and I

11362.479 --> 11369.16
will genuinely apologize and give you an

11366.16 --> 11371.96
opportunity to to share share your

11369.16 --> 11371.96
feelings about

11375.359 --> 11378.76
it I mean

11382.96 --> 11388.278999999999
it of course trolls not included cuz

11386.52 --> 11391.52
they can go [ __ ]

11388.279 --> 11394.12
themselves but I mean I have rubbed

11391.52 --> 11396.16
people the wrong way I really hope that

11394.12 --> 11397.68
slow-mo moon buggy is not that I didn't

11396.16 --> 11401.56
say anything

11397.68 --> 11403.84
wrong I mean I really miss that guy I

11401.56 --> 11403.84
really

11407.76 --> 11413.6
do like he's been

11410.8 --> 11416.239
great great having around and I I

11413.6 --> 11418.960000000001
genuinely miss him I'm like almost every

11416.239 --> 11422.6
day I feel like oh man I wish he would

11418.96 --> 11425.919999999998
show up now I know he's probably also

11422.6 --> 11428.399000000001
busy he mentioned that he was like

11425.92 --> 11431.6
moving or something and that could take

11428.399 --> 11434.8
a lot of effort and time

11431.6 --> 11438.68
and maybe he's having a break from the

11434.8 --> 11441.479
internet entirely which is not unwise to

11438.68 --> 11444.279
do that every now and

11441.479 --> 11449.119999999999
then but I do miss his presence and his

11444.279 --> 11449.12
input he always had such good tips

11471.279 --> 11477.800000000001
Gary Fe where the hell is Gary Fe is he

11473.359 --> 11481.239
still here is everybody just gone now

11477.8 --> 11483.56
do people only listen when I get all

11481.239 --> 11485.68
Rowdy and [ __ ] is that the only time

11483.56 --> 11488.439
you're going to say

11485.68 --> 11490.279
anything we have to get pissed off again

11488.439 --> 11492.800000000001
before people start saying anything in

11490.279 --> 11492.800000000001
the chat

11493.04 --> 11497.479000000001
again this is kind of ridiculous

11506.239 --> 11510.199999999999
guys for

11577.319 --> 11583.8
okay gy I'm really sorry man I don't

11581.08 --> 11587.68
know exactly what I did to offend you as

11583.8 --> 11592.8
much as you seem to be acting right now

11587.68 --> 11592.800000000001
but you won't seem to tell me

11595.12 --> 11599.880000000001
anything so but okay sure I guess I

11598.2 --> 11603.239000000001
won't have to worry about you I don't

11599.88 --> 11603.239
know exactly what I did

11603.56 --> 11610.84
wrong but whatever it is I apologize man

11606.8 --> 11614.119999999999
I'm sorry if I talked to you rudely or

11610.84 --> 11619.16
if I ignored your advice three days ago

11614.12 --> 11619.160000000002
I don't know what it was but I'm very

11625.6 --> 11630.6
sorry if they left and they are not

11628.239 --> 11634.64
hearing this

11630.6 --> 11634.640000000001
maybe I don't know where they are

11656.04 --> 11659.04
at

11686.04 --> 11690.0
for for

11737.68 --> 11744.720000000001
yeah clutch I don't know I don't know I

11740.8 --> 11748.599999999999
have no idea why Gary is acting like

11744.72 --> 11751.08
this I have no idea yeah he just refuses

11748.6 --> 11754.640000000001
to tell me so but apparently I really

11751.08 --> 11754.64
insulted him somehow

11756.52 --> 11762.960000000001
or Once Bitten Twice Shy unfortunately

11764.0 --> 11768.96
okay I don't know what that means

11791.76 --> 11796.800000000001
but still like to know exactly what you

11794.16 --> 11798.199
were telling me 3 days ago that would

11796.8 --> 11803.119999999999
have changed

11798.199 --> 11803.12
everything if I had only listened

11831.239 --> 11838.84
Des a safe space yeah yeah sure I mean

11834.64 --> 11838.84
Rich G this is a safe space for you man

11839.56 --> 11844.119999999999
I mean you're still here you even got

11841.92 --> 11844.12
your

11845.12 --> 11852.279
wrench I couldn't imagine any more safe

11848.08 --> 11857.08
space on the internet at this

11852.279 --> 11857.08
point for you so

11894.479 --> 11898.76
to be duper was the problem oh

11900.479 --> 11905.56
okay yeah well either way I agree

11922.8 --> 11928.72
clutch I and I agree like if duper does

11925.92 --> 11928.72
not

11928.76 --> 11933.72
stop the hassle that has been

11932.16 --> 11936.16
surrounding him pretty much from the

11933.72 --> 11940.0
start then I will probably kick him

11936.16 --> 11942.92
out cuz he's being a destabilizing

11940.0 --> 11945.92
factor and it's just getting really

11942.92 --> 11945.92
tedious

11964.199 --> 11968.319000000001
get this in any male dominated

11972.72 --> 11979.16
really come on clutch I

11976.08 --> 11982.16
mean she does have a bit of a point it

11979.16 --> 11982.16
is

11986.88 --> 11990.56
it is different because of

11993.239 --> 11998.399
that don't Richard don't don't do

11998.96 --> 12006.039999999999
that you don't have to go anywhere I I

12002.04 --> 12009.080000000002
didn't let you do all that just to have

12006.04 --> 12013.52
you like flee please

12009.08 --> 12017.239
don't please just stay

12013.52 --> 12019.880000000001
here and look guys like I genuine mean

12017.239 --> 12022.119999999999
it I've done things wrong I've done

12019.88 --> 12026.239
things wrong for a

12022.12 --> 12031.160000000002
while I thought it would work it's not

12026.239 --> 12035.119999999999
working and so I'm changing I I will and

12031.16 --> 12038.16
I am changing and I can I'm doing this

12035.12 --> 12041.199
because I can if I wouldn't be able to

12038.16 --> 12044.08
then i' literally would have said today

12041.199 --> 12046.880000000001
okay this is it I'm not doing this

12044.08 --> 12048.64
anymore it's over

12046.88 --> 12050.72
yeah I could have done that I could have

12048.64 --> 12052.08
done that today and said okay this is

12050.72 --> 12055.399
the last

12052.08 --> 12056.88
time I'm doing an early birth show I

12055.399 --> 12060.439
can't deal with this

12056.88 --> 12063.16
anymore it's not working it doesn't look

12060.439 --> 12065.199
like it is going to work and I'm done

12063.16 --> 12067.6
with it I'm going to try to figure out

12065.199 --> 12070.279
how to run my life in a different way

12067.6 --> 12074.800000000001
that could have happened

12070.279 --> 12077.720000000001
but I have the room and the dynamic I'm

12074.8 --> 12079.64
climbing out of my instability and I got

12077.72 --> 12084.198999999999
more

12079.64 --> 12086.84
room and so I'm going to do this

12084.199 --> 12089.720000000001
different and it's going to be genuinely

12086.84 --> 12091.439
different it's going to be socially

12089.72 --> 12094.88
emotionally

12091.439 --> 12097.199
different I have been too harsh with a

12094.88 --> 12101.679999999998
lot of

12097.199 --> 12104.479000000001
people I have been I know I have been

12101.68 --> 12106.880000000001
now I have been because that's kind of

12104.479 --> 12110.399
how I work

12106.88 --> 12114.64
I'm just like that

12110.399 --> 12116.8
but it's grounded things to a Hal over

12114.64 --> 12119.84
time

12116.8 --> 12122.519999999999
and and now I need to do it differently

12119.84 --> 12125.56
and I am I'm doing it differently right

12122.52 --> 12127.960000000001
now I hope you guys can feel it you guys

12125.56 --> 12131.519999999999
can notice it you probably have some

12127.96 --> 12134.56
unexpected size of relief here and

12131.52 --> 12137.439
there and that is purely because I'm

12134.56 --> 12139.198999999999
doing it differently cuz this is a

12137.439 --> 12144.08
different show now the way this is

12139.199 --> 12144.08
happening is different now it really

12147.199 --> 12151.399000000001

12149.479 --> 12153.399
transformation you're right in the

12151.399 --> 12157.16

12157.16 --> 12167.64
I'm going to do it different from now

on and give people more room

12173.56 --> 12178.239
yeah clutch with it's not about being

12175.479 --> 12180.8
treated different don't don't be so over

12178.239 --> 12183.6
sensitive to that what she means is that

12180.8 --> 12186.438999999998
if you just have men

12183.6 --> 12188.92
together it'll be in a certain way

12186.439 --> 12190.76
compared to if you have mostly women

12188.92 --> 12192.199
together it's different because of that

12190.76 --> 12193.72
that's what she's talking about she's

12192.199 --> 12198.279
not talking

12193.72 --> 12201.0
about feminism or anything so please

12198.279 --> 12201.0
just settle

12209.84 --> 12215.56
down do you

12211.96 --> 12217.399
want an apology for the misunderstanding

12215.56 --> 12220.399
of rate

12217.399 --> 12220.399
what

12220.8 --> 12229.16
uh what why I don't get it but sure

12226.68 --> 12231.56
I want treat she's not saying that she's

12229.16 --> 12234.64
being treated differently clutch that's

12231.56 --> 12234.64
not what she's talking

12235.68 --> 12243.399
about she's just talking about the

12238.72 --> 12243.399
overall influence not about

12244.96 --> 12251.399
treatment just about what is going on in

12249.12 --> 12256.720000000001
general that's what she is talking about

12251.399 --> 12256.72
not about how somebody is treating her

12256.84 --> 12259.359
settle

12275.51 --> 12278.729
[Music]

12293.16 --> 12298.8
mean I usually Reserve those kinds of

12296.16 --> 12302.359
remarks purely

12298.8 --> 12305.319
for just the worst of the worst kind of

12302.359 --> 12308.279
trolls so I can guarantee that I'll

12305.319 --> 12312.84
never ever say that

12308.279 --> 12316.359
again but I mean I don't generally tell

12312.84 --> 12316.359
people that

12320.8 --> 12328.0
so I don't know why you'd bring that up

12324.84 --> 12331.6
I mean did I tell you

12328.0 --> 12331.6
that I don't think

12336.199 --> 12342.16
so right but I've already

12339.319 --> 12344.039999999999
been getting that more under control I'm

12342.16 --> 12347.039999999999
working on

12344.04 --> 12349.560000000001
it I mean I'm still a person

12347.04 --> 12352.560000000001

12352.56 --> 12354.72
the

12363.359 --> 12370.04

things to talk about on that for sure

12416.96 --> 12422.358999999999
I'm sure it's going to be a continuation

12419.0 --> 12424.84
of today's situation and it would be

12422.359 --> 12427.52
good to have somebody else actually

12424.84 --> 12427.52
verbally

12428.08 --> 12433.239
speak

12429.84 --> 12435.76
cuz me just being the exclusive person

12433.239 --> 12438.16
talking here has been kind of rough to

12435.76 --> 12438.16
be fair

12438.32 --> 12443.128999999999
[Music]

12443.92 --> 12449.8

12455.199 --> 12461.560000000001
dust yeah Lucy just just let it the

12459.6 --> 12465.6

12529.64 --> 12533.319
mean there should be tons

12545.439 --> 12550.08
more rate tracing yeah but I'm not

12547.96 --> 12552.198999999999
really interested in talking about rate

12550.08 --> 12554.72
tracing with you to

12552.199 --> 12558.04
bable I don't really care that much

12554.72 --> 12558.039999999999
about that

12573.199 --> 12577.52
I mean just like how computer renders

12575.84 --> 12580.72
things and all that I

12577.52 --> 12583.640000000001
mean yeah sure it's something uh there's

12580.72 --> 12585.599999999999
really professional videos about that

12583.64 --> 12588.039999999999
there's no point in me talking about

12585.6 --> 12588.04
that at all

12589.279 --> 12596.239
all especially in like a person versus

12593.239 --> 12598.64
person type setup like there's no point

12596.239 --> 12602.52
I'm not going to talk about that it's

12598.64 --> 12605.119999999999
not within the range of my

12602.52 --> 12607.6
subject I mean just because it happens

12605.12 --> 12610.279
to become the conversation because of

12607.6 --> 12612.359
chat interaction in a part of the show

12610.279 --> 12616.279
that doesn't mean that it's now my

12612.359 --> 12616.279
subject it isn't

12623.12 --> 12626.359
all right

12672.279 --> 12675.279
h

12689.84 --> 12693.72

12696.92 --> 12703.6
stick to the Skype chat thank bill

12708.0 --> 12711.92
I don't know why you're just like

12710.239 --> 12715.56
communicating

12711.92 --> 12720.319
through the YouTube chat right now I

12715.56 --> 12723.8
thought there was like a issue with

12720.319 --> 12723.8
that this

12727.12 --> 12730.76
uh it's kind of

12730.96 --> 12735.759999999998
unusual hey FL Sage

welcome to the early bird show at the

12749.0 --> 12753.84
3our 30 minute

12751.72 --> 12756.679999999998
Mark I

12753.84 --> 12758.56
mean Tech you couldn't have possibly

12756.68 --> 12761.359
been more

12758.56 --> 12762.72
late seriously I'm actually about to

12761.359 --> 12765.239
round

12762.72 --> 12768.399
out but I mean I don't necessarily have

12765.239 --> 12771.64
to I can keep keep going for a

12768.399 --> 12775.439
bit but yeah you missed the

12771.64 --> 12777.039999999999
total chaos Fest the likes if you

12775.439 --> 12781.439
haven't

12777.04 --> 12781.439
seen in a while

12807.76 --> 12812.92
all right hope you've been sleeping

12810.319 --> 12815.96
okay just woke

12812.92 --> 12817.84
up thought something like that yeah I

12815.96 --> 12821.08
did actually wanted to talk to you

12817.84 --> 12824.08
yesterday but then I just like ball

12821.08 --> 12826.239
busters just went on and on and on for

12824.08 --> 12827.88
literally

12826.239 --> 12830.68
over four

12827.88 --> 12834.239
hours so I didn't really find the time

12830.68 --> 12834.239
to chat up with

12836.72 --> 12841.8
you yeah but today has been a total

12839.359 --> 12841.800000000001
chaos

12843.12 --> 12848.68
storm that's why it's in the title chaos

12846.08 --> 12851.76
storm I mean I don't use those words in

12848.68 --> 12851.76
my title very

12852.16 --> 12857.439
lightly it's been absolute chaos

12858.88 --> 12862.679999999998
around the 2hour Mark I actually thought

12861.12 --> 12864.880000000001
that it was going to be the last show I

12862.68 --> 12864.880000000001
would

12865.6 --> 12872.720000000001
do cuz it just went into total

12874.359 --> 12879.56
Malarkey that was a pretty that was

12877.56 --> 12882.519999999999
pretty interesting review show you mean

12879.56 --> 12886.319
the ball busters yeah it was interesting

12882.52 --> 12891.399000000001
and I'm glad I was part of that

12886.319 --> 12894.319
like despite the just continual

12891.399 --> 12897.039999999999
trolling eventually the Virgin do did

12894.319 --> 12898.96
actually clean it up a bit which is nice

12897.04 --> 12903.0
but I mean it was

12898.96 --> 12906.8
just endless endless trolling like it

12903.0 --> 12909.68
started out with just like 30 pure troll

12906.8 --> 12914.0
comments like before even anybody just

12909.68 --> 12917.64
said hello total Madness but still

12914.0 --> 12917.64
despite that it was a good show

12918.04 --> 12924.319000000001
and yeah had a pretty good stable time

12921.84 --> 12924.319
being on

12927.479 --> 12934.96
it like my own energies are stabilizing

12930.76 --> 12938.439
like in relation to the uh to the crew

12934.96 --> 12941.599999999999
there which like two three months ago

12938.439 --> 12945.16
was not the case at all like I would get

12941.6 --> 12946.92
like really weird from it like a weird

12945.16 --> 12950.68
tension

12946.92 --> 12953.279
and it seems like that's stopping like

12950.68 --> 12955.319
it stopped I didn't get it this time got

12953.279 --> 12956.439
a bit tired eventually but I mean it's

12955.319 --> 12958.239
such a long

12956.439 --> 12962.199
show

12958.239 --> 12965.239
but as long as they don't get like extra

12962.199 --> 12968.359
angry with the group dynamics it seems

12965.239 --> 12970.92
that I can just deal with it just fine

12968.359 --> 12973.92
it's that when the the whole group

12970.92 --> 12976.72
starts to act really angry that just

12973.92 --> 12979.199
like makes that trigger something really

12976.72 --> 12982.239
bad in my

12979.199 --> 12983.78
head wi it is just one embarrassment

12982.239 --> 12985.8
after

12983.78 --> 12988.199
[Music]

12985.8 --> 12991.679999999998
another

12988.199 --> 12994.16
yeah it it wasn't much of a flat Earth

12991.68 --> 12996.199
debate at all they just talked about the

12994.16 --> 12998.359
sky all the time and there was no

12996.199 --> 13001.04
reference to the Earth being flat or

12998.359 --> 13004.08
measured flat or navigated flat at

13001.04 --> 13006.720000000001
all at least the first half of that I

13004.08 --> 13009.68
mean maybe the next ball buster the next

13006.72 --> 13012.119999999999
time there will be some mention of how

13009.68 --> 13014.800000000001
the Earth is actually flat who knows but

13012.12 --> 13017.720000000001
it wasn't in the first half at

13014.8 --> 13020.72
least and it was kind of nonsensical I

13017.72 --> 13023.96
mean he was wi was basically just dis

13020.72 --> 13026.239
discussing a geocentric system and

13023.96 --> 13026.239
that's

13031.68 --> 13037.12
it he did not do a great job

13038.72 --> 13044.278999999999
I mean it could have been worse but it

13040.479 --> 13044.278999999999
was just not great

13065.64 --> 13070.099
right so

13067.04 --> 13070.099
[Music]

13073.72 --> 13078.438999999998
yeah you told you were C is because it's

13076.56 --> 13080.88
saying measuring Earth is flat is one of

13078.439 --> 13085.56
the best ways to prove its

13080.88 --> 13085.56
last I'm sure they do

13111.16 --> 13114.16
h

13141.84 --> 13148.12
right I'm going to round out the show I

13143.72 --> 13151.0
need some uh some lunch and all that and

13148.12 --> 13153.92
it's still need there a recovery time so

13151.0 --> 13156.8
I could do the loop build Evolution show

13153.92 --> 13161.279
or yeah the show with him

13156.8 --> 13161.278999999999
on the night owl number eight

13166.12 --> 13172.359
later according to Ken langy it's bad to

13170.08 --> 13175.359
parir it back correct

13172.359 --> 13175.359
information

13176.359 --> 13181.399000000001
yeah Ken is a bit of a goofball

13189.0 --> 13196.64
what time is night ow uh that's like 11

13194.279 --> 13200.279
pm California

13196.64 --> 13200.278999999999
time something like

13200.479 --> 13205.599999999999
that um let me check email

13213.96 --> 13221.08
again 11 11 a.m. California time that's

13218.8 --> 13223.278999999999
what he said I don't know when exactly

13221.08 --> 13223.279
that

13227.76 --> 13235.0
is is that like 10 p.m. Amsterdam

13231.72 --> 13238.479
time or is that 1:00 I'm not sure how

13235.0 --> 13238.479
late that is

13250.59 --> 13255.979
[Music]

13258.79 --> 13261.869
[Applause]

13264.96 --> 13270.64
oh that's 8

13266.08 --> 13270.64
o00 oh that's that's actually kind of

13270.96 --> 13280.519999999999
quickly that's 8:00 p.m. Amsterdam time

13275.0 --> 13280.52
so that's 2 hours and 20 minutes from

13281.56 --> 13286.88
now roughly around that time I don't

13284.239 --> 13291.8
know when I mean I still have

13286.88 --> 13291.8
to has to actually contact me on

13292.52 --> 13297.720000000001
Skype otherwise it's like how the hell

13294.96 --> 13297.72
is it even going to

13301.76 --> 13307.239
work so I hope that will work

13312.08 --> 13316.66

13353.48 --> 13356.689999999999
[Applause]

13363.69 --> 13368.28
[Music]

13369.479 --> 13374.278999999999
forward to it yeah yeah me too I hope

13372.08 --> 13376.159
it's going to work I mean it could be

13374.279 --> 13379.199
that I

13376.159 --> 13381.76
yeah I mean Loop Evolution hasn't

13379.199 --> 13384.76
actually added me on Skype

13381.76 --> 13384.76
yet

13384.84 --> 13389.56
so if he doesn't do that in time then

13388.04 --> 13392.04
yeah like he's not going to be able to

13389.56 --> 13392.039999999999
get on my

13394.12 --> 13398.08
show for

13449.04 --> 13454.52
all right so yeah r g if you're still

13451.52 --> 13454.52
there

13463.08 --> 13467.8
let me know in Skype as

13469.439 --> 13474.319
well it's difficult for Flat Earth shows

13472.359 --> 13477.08
to stay interesting there's only so much

13474.319 --> 13479.56
you can say

13477.08 --> 13480.76
yeah well it's just it becomes a

13479.56 --> 13483.88
community

13480.76 --> 13486.08
thing and there's plenty of adjacent

13483.88 --> 13488.399
subjects to talk about out but I mean

13486.08 --> 13491.0
eventually those kind of run out as

13488.399 --> 13492.8
well unless you have like massive

13491.0 --> 13495.64
amounts of

13492.8 --> 13497.72
research because yeah I I talk about

13495.64 --> 13501.358999999999
Giants as

13497.72 --> 13504.198999999999
well talk about alternative

13501.359 --> 13506.800000000001
history talk about Spirit mechanics talk

13504.199 --> 13508.880000000001
a lot about rudol Steiner when I

13506.8 --> 13511.88
can and the

13508.88 --> 13511.88
technique

13512.239 --> 13517.439
and talk about

13515.199 --> 13520.880000000001
narratives in general like social

13517.439 --> 13523.479000000001
engineering and social media narratives

13520.88 --> 13526.319
and the different layers and how that

13523.479 --> 13530.319
works and the compartmentalization in

13526.319 --> 13533.8
people's minds of those that actually do

13530.319 --> 13537.88
it so yeah there there is plenty to talk

13533.8 --> 13540.92
about but it just needs to have its

13537.88 --> 13542.72
moment because you can't just like force

13540.92 --> 13545.399
like oh yeah I have to talk about

13542.72 --> 13549.56
something let's talk about this no it

13545.399 --> 13549.56
has to have a natural

13550.64 --> 13556.96
spark has to be some animal for it as

13554.76 --> 13556.960000000001
they

13557.199 --> 13566.68
say they never try convincing people

13562.04 --> 13569.399000000001
anymore yeah well just give them

13566.68 --> 13571.6
arguments and then they'll either

13569.399 --> 13573.479
convince themselves or brace against it

13571.6 --> 13576.880000000001
I

13573.479 --> 13579.479
mean active trying to convince somebody

13576.88 --> 13582.399
yeah that's that's a lot of energy with

13579.479 --> 13584.599999999999
usually very little result and the more

13582.399 --> 13587.119999999999
time pass is the worst it'll get because

13584.6 --> 13590.439
everybody's getting completely bombarded

13587.12 --> 13592.6
and snowed under with propaganda and

13590.439 --> 13594.6
social engineering and just pushiness

13592.6 --> 13598.04
all around and the more that's going to

13594.6 --> 13601.720000000001
happen the less receptive people will

13598.04 --> 13604.239000000001
get for being convinced about

13601.72 --> 13606.519999999999
anything so yeah the more time passes

13604.239 --> 13610.72
the more ult it's going to be to get

13606.52 --> 13610.720000000001
through to anybody about anything

13631.93 --> 13636.149
[Music]

13647.35 --> 13650.52
[Music]

13693.76 --> 13697.76
for e

13717.97 --> 13721.019999999999
[Music]

13741.479 --> 13746.56
right so I got the permanent title now

13743.96 --> 13749.159
chaos storm commences clearing the dust

13746.56 --> 13753.039999999999
and Reformation settles in so that's

13749.159 --> 13753.039999999999
exactly what happened today

13769.279 --> 13776.6
right anyhow I'm rounding out the

13773.08 --> 13779.56
show so hopefully in roughly two hours

13776.6 --> 13781.960000000001
there will be another night owl show

13779.56 --> 13784.92
maybe there

13781.96 --> 13787.519999999999
won't I hope there will I got a kind of

13784.92 --> 13790.239
got a feeling like there's a 50/50

13787.52 --> 13794.0
chance that it's not going to happen and

13790.239 --> 13796.52
if it won't then well it'll be okay I

13794.0 --> 13798.08
mean blue build evolution is kind of a

13796.52 --> 13801.279
busy

13798.08 --> 13804.359
guy and it would be very early for him

13801.279 --> 13804.359
on a Sunday

13806.08 --> 13814.359
so all right but hopefully it will

13809.12 --> 13814.359
happen and otherwise maybe another day

13820.239 --> 13824.76
right but I am going to round out now

13822.439 --> 13829.0
it's almost 4

13824.76 --> 13829.0
hours I believe it's been that

13830.92 --> 13839.08
long so yeah storm outside storm inside

13835.479 --> 13843.278999999999
God what a Restless day today

13839.08 --> 13845.239
was I hope I'm going to like sleep well

13843.279 --> 13847.52
though and

13845.239 --> 13850.56
at least it's not as cold and it's going

13847.52 --> 13854.04
to be a little bit warmer in the coming

13850.56 --> 13858.479
period so yeah that should be

13854.04 --> 13862.68
good right so thanks everyone for coming
