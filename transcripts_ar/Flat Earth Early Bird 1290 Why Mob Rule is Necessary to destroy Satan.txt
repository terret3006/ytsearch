look at how blue that is

136.5 --> 139.16

156.72 --> 163.2
beautiful day not as hot

160.26 --> 166.62
as it was yesterday in the afternoon and

163.2 --> 169.56
yeah yesterday evening it did actually

166.62 --> 172.44
start to rain

169.56 --> 174.8
quite a bit even so there was some rain

172.44 --> 174.8
yesterday

175.019 --> 180.86
it probably did cool off the place

178.2 --> 180.85999999999999
but

181.019 --> 187.159
it's nice and dry again

272.639 --> 276.479
little startled this morning because of

274.32 --> 278.28

almost every show has been great

287.1 --> 291.54
titles and all yesterday not really a

289.919 --> 293.28
title although I could probably think of

291.54 --> 295.139
one but

293.28 --> 298.73999999999995
and I did

295.139 --> 300.84000000000003
actually get some comments this time and

298.74 --> 302.88
I thank you very much for that of course

300.84 --> 304.67999999999995
the trolls had to immediately start

302.88 --> 306.71999999999997
whining about that

304.68 --> 308.58

400.319 --> 405.97900000000004
apt you have to pay for your new app

403.02 --> 405.979
what does that mean

410.46 --> 414.0
anyhow it's all right

412.31 --> 419.3
[Music]

414.0 --> 419.3
uh apartment okay right right

446.54 --> 449.67900000000003
[Music]

480.3 --> 485.28000000000003
ah sorry uh

483.06 --> 487.319
right so yeah everything's pretty much

485.28 --> 490.34
going as

487.319 --> 490.34000000000003
as it is

490.74 --> 496.199
forming situation in the Netherlands is

493.44 --> 498.12
still getting pushed

496.199 --> 500.84000000000003
then there is still resistance and I

498.12 --> 500.84000000000003
don't know like

501.3 --> 506.52000000000004
where it's going though

503.879 --> 509.40000000000003
I'm not really getting the uh the feel

506.52 --> 512.8199999999999
that these political parties although

509.4 --> 514.9789999999999
they are exposing themselves to no end

512.82 --> 517.82
it's mostly the three

514.979 --> 520.9190000000001
vvd

517.82 --> 523.9190000000001
d66 but p

520.919 --> 523.919
vda

524.159 --> 529.3199999999999
which is like the labor party

527.04 --> 533.399
they too

529.32 --> 535.2600000000001
they are to in this crazy world economic

533.399 --> 538.26
Forum screen

535.26 --> 541.279
they're all double thinking nut casing

538.26 --> 541.279
nut cases

542.82 --> 549.38
and yeah well at least they're exposing

545.76 --> 549.38
themselves to a certain degree

550.019 --> 554.6
I don't know if that's gonna be enough

552.18 --> 554.5999999999999
though

557.58 --> 562.399
the whole situation is kind of making me

559.98 --> 562.399
nervous

574.019 --> 576.62
right

584.16 --> 591.3
so anybody

587.519 --> 593.88
like to start a conversation it may have

591.3 --> 595.62
me address a certain subject

593.88 --> 598.88
speak up I don't really have anything

595.62 --> 598.88
specific at hand

601.079 --> 608.2399999999999
I guess in a way that I would be open

603.66 --> 608.24
for guests if they are yeah

608.64 --> 613.5
they're flat Earth early bird followers

610.98 --> 616.44
at least not just gonna take random

613.5 --> 618.66
people that I don't really know

616.44 --> 621.62
if you might want to come on like

618.66 --> 621.62
through a Skype call

631.2 --> 638.36
what did you see that

634.68 --> 638.3599999999999
Bank goes down okay

643.56 --> 647.06
oh do you have a guess head

653.48 --> 658.16
tender and never heard of it

663.3 --> 665.4799999999999
foreign

669.06 --> 676.9799999999999
right so there was a bit of a bank

671.36 --> 680.7
freeze or crash you're saying PGC net

676.98 --> 681.839
it wasn't like a controlled whole bank

680.7 --> 683.88
holiday

681.839 --> 686.7600000000001
which isn't that like what happens

683.88 --> 689.519
during the Jubilee celebration isn't

686.76 --> 693.62
that like official

689.519 --> 693.62
so this was an unplanned

695.399 --> 699.18
Bank

697.62 --> 702.14
freeze

699.18 --> 702.14
is that what you think

703.079 --> 708.12
if you have any like

705.0 --> 711.0
good news article about it then don't

708.12 --> 714.92
yeah and share it

711.0 --> 714.92
a technical Pro right

716.279 --> 721.56
so they didn't intend to do that it was

718.5 --> 725.779
just a a crash

721.56 --> 725.779
it just broke all right

763.44 --> 765.98
foreign

776.899 --> 781.8
I think that some people do actually see

779.82 --> 784.2
it

781.8 --> 786.42
it's just that like what are we gonna do

784.2 --> 788.76
with the action moment how's the action

786.42 --> 790.62
actually gonna stop the situation and

788.76 --> 793.86
not make things worse that's been like

790.62 --> 795.6
kind of the Dilemma for a long time

793.86 --> 798.66
I'd say

795.6 --> 801.0
it has caused entire groups to like wow

798.66 --> 801.98
that they would never

801.0 --> 804.12
ever

801.98 --> 805.62
be violent

804.12 --> 810.12
right ever

805.62 --> 813.5600000000001
well that simply may be unfit infeasible

810.12 --> 813.5600000000001
in my opinion

817.2 --> 823.44
I think like it it might actually have

820.44 --> 825.839
to turn into rake and torches time like

823.44 --> 829.0790000000001
it might be unavoidable

825.839 --> 831.98
and that means that people should really

829.079 --> 831.9799999999999
not avoid it

832.579 --> 837.4799999999999
especially out of fear right that's the

835.92 --> 839.8199999999999
factor

837.48 --> 841.9200000000001
it's like as long as the ones that are

839.82 --> 843.9590000000001
figuring out what's going on and that

841.92 --> 846.06
are like really sick of it and want to

843.959 --> 849.7199999999999
take action as long as they are afraid

846.06 --> 854.18
that if they go further

849.72 --> 854.1800000000001
than just basic protesting

854.399 --> 858.66
that oh they might get in trouble or

856.86 --> 862.38
like that's when the real Crackdown

858.66 --> 864.24
starts if you're afraid of that

862.38 --> 869.3389999999999
then they win

864.24 --> 873.12
because then they're gonna lean on that

869.339 --> 876.12
so easy everybody's just too afraid to

873.12 --> 878.4590000000001
actually start bashing our faces in and

876.12 --> 883.32
slitting our throats they're too afraid

878.459 --> 883.3199999999999
so we can do anything anything

883.62 --> 889.199
the crazier the better because

886.1 --> 893.12
everybody's too afraid to do something

889.199 --> 893.12
about it other than just

896.339 --> 901.5
right

898.079 --> 904.199
they're gonna lean on it

901.5 --> 906.66
they're gonna gloat over it they're

904.199 --> 909.4799999999999
gonna enjoy their double speak they're

906.66 --> 914.04
gonna flaunt it in your face how insane

909.48 --> 916.9200000000001
they are and how afraid of them you are

914.04 --> 919.92
that you'll just spend all your time

916.92 --> 923.16
trying to psychologically analyze and

919.92 --> 925.3389999999999
unravel and counter their blatant

923.16 --> 928.98
insanity

925.339 --> 931.44
not actually stopping it just countering

928.98 --> 937.259
it right they're scattergunting us with

931.44 --> 939.74
insanity and like straight on treason

937.259 --> 943.38
and then if we spend all our time

939.74 --> 946.259
countering their crazy scatter gunny

943.38 --> 948.899
then they're not effectively gonna stop

946.259 --> 952.62
scatter gunning and they'll have all the

948.899 --> 956.839
room in the world to just unroll their

952.62 --> 956.839
treasonous anti-human agenda

957.0 --> 963.959
so they're leaning on it like hard

960.6 --> 968.0400000000001
leaning like on your neck leaning on it

963.959 --> 970.92
like oh that's so great man we've

968.04 --> 972.779
conditioned them all through moves and

970.92 --> 977.3389999999999
culture and politics and advertisement

972.779 --> 979.5
corporations they're all too afraid

977.339 --> 983.4590000000001
to actually

979.5 --> 986.339
get rid of us they're too afraid

983.459 --> 988.38
they're counting on it

986.339 --> 992.5790000000001
counting on it

988.38 --> 995.42
I've seen that coming for a long time

992.579 --> 998.699
that's why I've been harping on it

995.42 --> 1002.3
countering it saying no no no violence

998.699 --> 1004.519
is the answer for a long time everybody

1002.3 --> 1009.4399999999999
thought I was crazy I know

1004.519 --> 1009.44
in a way it is crazy right but

1010.82 --> 1016.4200000000001
what are you gonna do not be crazy and

1014.72 --> 1019.1600000000001
have them

1016.42 --> 1023.3
lean on your neck

1019.16 --> 1025.339
all the Glee and enjoyment that they can

1023.3 --> 1029.12
Master instead

1025.339 --> 1031.76
is that the better option then

1029.12 --> 1035.4799999999998
think about that

1031.76 --> 1038.78
right don't delude yourself in that just

1035.48 --> 1041.3600000000001
doing the contemporarily seemingly good

1038.78 --> 1043.28
thing is going to actually fix the

1041.36 --> 1045.4389999999999
situation

1043.28 --> 1048.439
yeah that's called staring yourself

1045.439 --> 1048.439
blind

1064.28 --> 1069.16
okay Jared Sandra I don't understand

1065.9 --> 1069.16
that sentence there

1069.2 --> 1071.5
foreign

1077.419 --> 1082.64
so what I think needs to happen

1080.72 --> 1085.58
I've been saying it even on the Dutch

1082.64 --> 1087.2
sites and all they don't like it they so

1085.58 --> 1090.32
don't like it when I do that they delete

1087.2 --> 1092.9
my comments when I say things like we

1090.32 --> 1095.6599999999999
should reintroduce the death penalty

1092.9 --> 1098.6000000000001
they don't like that they remove it from

1095.66 --> 1101.8400000000001
the alternative sites

1098.6 --> 1104.48
from these counter New World Order site

1101.84 --> 1108.74
they delete those messages

1104.48 --> 1110.9
they're afraid they're so afraid

1108.74 --> 1112.76
so afraid that everybody they're gonna

1110.9 --> 1115.1000000000001
come after them

1112.76 --> 1117.919
I mean I they must think that

1115.1 --> 1122.0
this government is literally as powerful

1117.919 --> 1123.6200000000001
as the Nazis from movies they must think

1122.0 --> 1127.4
that at this point

1123.62 --> 1131.12
I mean why wouldn't you just all

1127.4 --> 1134.8400000000001
go after him and say like yeah let's not

1131.12 --> 1137.4399999999998
be afraid let's do whatever is necessary

1134.84 --> 1140.299
and will

1137.44 --> 1141.919
rebuild we'll figure out what to do

1140.299 --> 1146.9189999999999
afterward

1141.919 --> 1146.919
first let's Slaughter these people

1150.74 --> 1155.9
as in let's ensure that their Spirit of

1153.86 --> 1159.3799999999999
confidence that they can just be

1155.9 --> 1161.38
treasonous and insane and nothing nobody

1159.38 --> 1165.2600000000002
will do anything about them because

1161.38 --> 1167.74
legally they got it all covered

1165.26 --> 1167.74
right

1167.9 --> 1172.88
as long as you're gonna leave that

1169.6 --> 1174.559
there's no there's no way out it doesn't

1172.88 --> 1177.2
really matter at that point whether

1174.559 --> 1179.12
you're even protesting or not as long as

1177.2 --> 1181.82
they can think that they can get away

1179.12 --> 1183.02
with this using their little legal

1181.82 --> 1186.26
backing

1183.02 --> 1186.98
and that's why you have to bypass all

1186.26 --> 1190.94
that

1186.98 --> 1194.059
and go straight to the roots

1190.94 --> 1196.8200000000002
if a politician is treasonous

1194.059 --> 1199.52
and it becomes blatantly obvious

1196.82 --> 1202.76
and there's like damage among the public

1199.52 --> 1206.299
directly because of their actions

1202.76 --> 1208.82
then you form a mob

1206.299 --> 1211.039
you go to their houses

1208.82 --> 1213.9189999999999
you drag them out

1211.039 --> 1217.78
you stomp on their limbsome

1213.919 --> 1217.7800000000002
and then you light them on fire

1218.12 --> 1224.3799999999999
and in these days you can film that too

1221.659 --> 1229.159
yeah and then you can send those videos

1224.38 --> 1229.159
to the other politicians

1230.419 --> 1235.7800000000002
guess what's gonna happen after that

1233.179 --> 1239.0590000000002
they're not gonna have their little

1235.78 --> 1242.12
double speak move

1239.059 --> 1245.4189999999999
all over us again oh they might go oh we

1242.12 --> 1248.4189999999999
need the police this oh God we're we're

1245.419 --> 1251.0
in Civil War yeah yeah yeah yeah keep

1248.419 --> 1253.64
harping keep resisting right because

1251.0 --> 1255.5
what you're gonna send the military the

1253.64 --> 1257.48
police after us

1255.5 --> 1260.6
but you're gonna have them guard your

1257.48 --> 1264.02
houses 24 7 all the time

1260.6 --> 1267.86
dude it's Gotta it's not gonna help you

1264.02 --> 1271.039
the only recourse is to flee before you

1267.86 --> 1273.799

1271.039 --> 1276.74
and then even if you flee we're gonna

1284.659 --> 1289.8200000000002
remember how

1286.28 --> 1292.46
like certain Jew organizations went

1289.82 --> 1295.6399999999999
after the Nazis and followed them around

1292.46 --> 1298.3400000000001
the world to try to trace them down and

1295.64 --> 1300.7990000000002
get them and bring them to justice we're

1298.34 --> 1304.6
gonna do that too

1300.799 --> 1307.94

1318.86 --> 1325.2199999999998
traitors against our country

1322.039 --> 1327.919
and you will pay for it

1325.22 --> 1330.559
you're not gonna get away even though

1327.919 --> 1333.38
the system that you were a part of has

1330.559 --> 1336.74
made all these options for you to get

1333.38 --> 1339.74
away every time right it's so safe yeah

1336.74 --> 1341.419
yeah that system is starting to buckle

1339.74 --> 1347.72
and falter

1341.419 --> 1349.72
and we will hunt you down you understand

1347.72 --> 1353.419
New World Order

1349.72 --> 1358.24
treasonous politicians

1353.419 --> 1358.24
you're not gonna get away with it

1364.28 --> 1368.48
that's called mob rule that's right and

1366.44 --> 1372.46
we need it back

1368.48 --> 1372.46
we need it back right away

1372.62 --> 1378.9189999999999
and pick up the pieces afterward

1375.74 --> 1383.1200000000001
people that are currently in power are

1378.919 --> 1386.3600000000001
full on treasonous they need to die they

1383.12 --> 1387.799
need to die they need to be executed as

1386.36 --> 1389.6589999999999
traitors

1387.799 --> 1393.5
and as witches

1389.659 --> 1397.0390000000002
in my opinion too because they are

1393.5 --> 1398.679
they're beyond regular Liars

1397.039 --> 1403.28
they have

1398.679 --> 1405.5590000000002
purposeful evil malicious intent

1403.28 --> 1407.6589999999999
for the people that they're supposed to

1405.559 --> 1410.1399999999999
be ruling over and guarding and

1407.659 --> 1410.14
protecting

1411.679 --> 1414.46
foreign

1418.7 --> 1424.3400000000001
people nowadays are too sensitive you I

1421.64 --> 1427.76
am too sensitive yeah

1424.34 --> 1430.36
I am too sensitive and I came to this

1427.76 --> 1430.36
conclusion

1432.38 --> 1436.5390000000002
it doesn't matter how sensitive you are

1437.24 --> 1440.5
it needs to be done

1447.76 --> 1457.95
[Music]

1462.26 --> 1466.64
ah

1464.059 --> 1470.48
so yeah

1466.64 --> 1472.88
I am regularly imagining what it would

1470.48 --> 1475.46
be like to be the person to basically do

1472.88 --> 1478.5200000000002
that and how I would absolutely not have

1475.46 --> 1481.52
a life afterward especially if I'm like

1478.52 --> 1485.74
the only one to actually do it and

1481.52 --> 1485.74
everybody's just gonna dump it all on me

1486.2 --> 1493.5800000000002
I have been imagining that and like

1490.039 --> 1497.179
because I'm not just going to throw my

1493.58 --> 1497.96
my entire life and potential away on my

1497.179 --> 1500.9
own

1497.96 --> 1504.44
to then see the entire country revert

1500.9 --> 1506.659
right back to right before that so that

1504.44 --> 1510.02
all of it would have been for nothing

1506.659 --> 1512.24
the treacherous politicians might be

1510.02 --> 1514.52
replaced and then everybody's gonna let

1512.24 --> 1516.679
them do the exact same thing again if

1514.52 --> 1518.72
that's going to be the rent result then

1516.679 --> 1521.3200000000002
I'm not gonna do anything

1518.72 --> 1521.32
right

1521.86 --> 1527.059
besides how am I gonna take out on my

1525.799 --> 1531.1399999999999
own like

1527.059 --> 1532.94
what is it 40 to 100 people that are all

1531.14 --> 1535.5200000000002
involved in this including the high

1532.94 --> 1538.46
courts how am I gonna do that I don't

1535.52 --> 1541.279
know even where they are as soon as I

1538.46 --> 1543.02
take down one everybody's alerted I will

1541.279 --> 1544.88
not be able to get to the others it's

1543.02 --> 1547.76
going to be pointless that's why it's

1544.88 --> 1550.94
gonna have to be an organized effort

1547.76 --> 1553.76
where hundreds of people get into place

1550.94 --> 1558.2
stand ready and then execute the night

1553.76 --> 1561.86
of the Long Knives on these traitors

1558.2 --> 1564.919
that style that's the only way to do it

1561.86 --> 1568.2199999999998
there's no other way I can imagine that

1564.919 --> 1570.5
it could actually be successful

1568.22 --> 1572.539
with a successful end result and not

1570.5 --> 1574.9
just right away right back where you

1572.539 --> 1574.9
started

1583.52 --> 1585.94
right

1600.14 --> 1608.48
oh the witch on the market the mob the

1604.52 --> 1610.76
mob turning against me right yes they're

1608.48 --> 1613.58
gonna attack somebody

1610.76 --> 1616.64
over Flat Earth believe no no they're

1613.58 --> 1619.039
not dude they can't even approach flat

1616.64 --> 1623.0
earthers that's the whole point

1619.039 --> 1625.4
there will never be a mob rule to get go

1623.0 --> 1628.4
after flat earthers because flat

1625.4 --> 1629.8400000000001
earthers don't double speak and lie

1628.4 --> 1633.0800000000002
about everything

1629.84 --> 1635.539
it's exactly the opposite so how can you

1633.08 --> 1637.4189999999999
even go at it oh look at the mob they're

1635.539 --> 1641.12
coming out oh flutter there's yeah yeah

1637.419 --> 1644.0590000000002
let hear us shout out the arguments that

1641.12 --> 1646.76
you are ignoring that are factually true

1644.059 --> 1649.6399999999999
let us shout the arguments that you can

1646.76 --> 1651.26
literally calculate on the spot research

1649.64 --> 1654.14
Trace

1651.26 --> 1656.419
that are all exactly true yes yes oh

1654.14 --> 1659.419
that's going to be a great mop what are

1656.419 --> 1662.419
they gonna stab their own eyes out and

1659.419 --> 1664.159
put cotton balls in their ears and then

1662.419 --> 1668.659
come after us is that how they're gonna

1664.159 --> 1670.8200000000002
do it no no aries 106 that makes no

1668.659 --> 1673.8200000000002

happen yeah

1692.299 --> 1700.51

1701.74 --> 1707.419

1703.64 --> 1709.76
just go on race war and all that and

1707.419 --> 1711.8600000000001
like brutalize totally innocent people

1709.76 --> 1714.08
that aren't even expecting it right

1711.86 --> 1717.4399999999998
we've all seen it's all on camera it's

1714.08 --> 1720.08
all oh yes yes well that's the dark side

1717.44 --> 1723.02
that's how everything would be done

1720.08 --> 1727.52
wrong well if we have a mob rule against

1723.02 --> 1732.1399999999999
evil like this it won't be like that

1727.52 --> 1733.76
you'll just have videos of executions

1732.14 --> 1736.279
of people

1733.76 --> 1738.3799999999999
on which you could basically pull an

1736.279 --> 1740.72
entire background on them

1738.38 --> 1743.0
even in the video itself of the

1740.72 --> 1745.279
execution you could just put look this

1743.0 --> 1747.38
is what this motherfucker's done this is

1745.279 --> 1750.26
how many people he got killed this is

1747.38 --> 1752.2990000000002
how much money he stole this is the

1750.26 --> 1756.26
condition

1752.299 --> 1759.26
of the place that he ruled over

1756.26 --> 1760.76
after he started because of what he's

1759.26 --> 1763.34
done right

1760.76 --> 1765.399
it's different it's not going to be like

1763.34 --> 1770.6789999999999
this sick

1765.399 --> 1773.4799999999998
riots race racist riots and just

1770.679 --> 1776.179
[ __ ] burning of stars and all that

1773.48 --> 1780.52
that's not this that's not gonna be mob

1776.179 --> 1780.52
rule at all it's quite the opposite

1781.88 --> 1788.0590000000002
yeah and just look how well the police

1785.0 --> 1791.0
is handling even those rides they're not

1788.059 --> 1793.7
they're not handling it

1791.0 --> 1795.679
and besides I'm quite confident that if

1793.7 --> 1798.799
a true mob

1795.679 --> 1801.3200000000002
would form to actually be determined

1798.799 --> 1804.74
enough and trained enough

1801.32 --> 1807.279
to take out the politicians that those

1804.74 --> 1811.64
[ __ ] police officers

1807.279 --> 1814.22
filthy mercenary [ __ ] that might try to

1811.64 --> 1817.5800000000002
stop you they're gonna just get trampled

1814.22 --> 1820.76
right I mean they start shooting at the

1817.58 --> 1823.1
mob they're gonna get literally their

1820.76 --> 1825.74
their face is crushed on the sidewalk

1823.1 --> 1826.9399999999998
with people's heels they're gonna die

1825.74 --> 1829.039
brutally

1826.94 --> 1832.0
right you're gonna stand in the way of

1829.039 --> 1836.24
the mob rule against the treacherous

1832.0 --> 1839.6
government people that whose time has

1836.24 --> 1842.84
come then you are directly an accomplice

1839.6 --> 1844.6399999999999
to that level and then you die too an

1842.84 --> 1848.6
entire police squads could just

1844.64 --> 1852.5
literally die within a time span of 10

1848.6 --> 1854.84
minutes if they dare stand in the way of

1852.5 --> 1858.86
such a a happening

1854.84 --> 1863.24
then you have no chance no chance

1858.86 --> 1865.1
they have no chance if we use mob rule

1863.24 --> 1867.2
no chance

1865.1 --> 1869.299
there's nothing they can do

1867.2 --> 1870.8600000000001
what you think that there's going to be

1869.299 --> 1874.76

1870.86 --> 1877.299
literally mow down a sizable chunk of

treacherous blatantly treacherous

1882.94 --> 1888.2

1885.26 --> 1890.899
do that I think that military would have

1888.2 --> 1893.96
an internal revolutions on their hand if

1890.899 --> 1895.9799999999998

1910.279 --> 1916.76
I think evils in prisons are a hazard

1914.299 --> 1918.3799999999999
evil politicians because they will have

1916.76 --> 1919.94
connections they will have knowledge

1918.38 --> 1923.3600000000001
they will have tricks they will have

1919.94 --> 1924.559
power they will not be effectively in

1923.36 --> 1927.5
prison

1924.559 --> 1928.82
that's why the death penalty is the only

1927.5 --> 1933.08
answer

1928.82 --> 1935.899
that's how you truly circum meant how

1933.08 --> 1939.019
you erase their power

1935.899 --> 1942.1589999999999
their power of abuse you erase it by

1939.019 --> 1942.159
executing them

1950.899 --> 1955.6999999999998
it has not worked out very well

1952.88 --> 1958.46
historically oh yeah yeah how well has

1955.7 --> 1961.059
it historically worked out to just let

1958.46 --> 1964.88
it happen huh how well did it go that

1961.059 --> 1968.059
historically in Rome Aries 106 when the

1964.88 --> 1971.019
empress went entirely to [ __ ] and insane

1968.059 --> 1976.34
in order to burn their own cities down

1976.34 --> 1984.34
that work out for you huh Ares 106.

1980.539 --> 1989.24
how well does not doing it work out

1984.34 --> 1992.72
historically Aries 106. huh why'd you

1989.24 --> 1995.36
put some of those examples right next

1992.72 --> 1998.1200000000001
to the times when it didn't work out

1995.36 --> 2001.059
very well under mob rule yeah why don't

1998.12 --> 2003.8799999999999
you put the times next to that when they

2001.059 --> 2006.94
didn't do that huh how well did that

2003.88 --> 2009.72
work out oh the entire place was

2006.94 --> 2016.0

2035.799 --> 2039.82
head we only need to get rid of this one

2038.26 --> 2041.799
person and then everything will change

2039.82 --> 2043.84
and it turns out it doesn't change at

2041.799 --> 2046.48
all because it wasn't just that one

2043.84 --> 2049.419
person and then the rest comes after you

2046.48 --> 2050.679
yeah of course that happens that's why

2049.419 --> 2055.1389999999997
you have to

2050.679 --> 2060.839
get a list and get them all all of them

2055.139 --> 2060.839
not just the head all of them

2070.3 --> 2077.5
and I raised my Gypsy sure dude

2073.659 --> 2082.0
look you can take it wherever you like

2077.5 --> 2084.099
torture or not I I don't I mean torture

2082.0 --> 2087.22
in general doesn't really matter the

2084.099 --> 2089.02
situation is never good for morale

2087.22 --> 2092.379
but again

2089.02 --> 2096.099
thumb might simply be necessary as a

2092.379 --> 2098.74
direct detergent to literally make these

2096.099 --> 2101.26
treacherous politician types that might

2098.74 --> 2104.02
have ambition to do that [ __ ] their

2101.26 --> 2107.38
pants so much and have nightmares to no

2104.02 --> 2110.02
end about being tortured to death

2107.38 --> 2114.339
because they've seen it actually happen

2110.02 --> 2116.56
yeah that's a good reason to do it

2114.339 --> 2119.32
not because it's fun

2116.56 --> 2121.9
because everybody wants revenge because

2119.32 --> 2123.1600000000003
it is effectively demoralizing to do

2121.9 --> 2126.04
that

2123.16 --> 2128.2
but as a deterrent can be quite useful

2126.04 --> 2131.2
and that includes putting people on

2128.2 --> 2133.2999999999997
poles and just whipping them to death

2131.2 --> 2136.359
on [ __ ] camera

2133.3 --> 2139.0
right or lighting them on fire

2136.359 --> 2140.619
or skinning them alive and then burying

2139.0 --> 2145.0
them on their salt

2140.619 --> 2148.78
whatever the [ __ ] you can think of right

2145.0 --> 2151.42
it's about showing other types like that

2148.78 --> 2154.7200000000003
this is gonna happen to you if you want

2151.42 --> 2156.94
to do that you want to take that risk oh

2154.72 --> 2158.98
you oh you'll be the badass or you have

2156.94 --> 2160.48
so much power you could just lie and get

2158.98 --> 2162.64
away with it oh look at all the money

2160.48 --> 2165.52
yeah yeah

2162.64 --> 2166.54
and then you're going to be tortured to

2165.52 --> 2169.48
death

2166.54 --> 2173.079
you still want to do it huh you still

2169.48 --> 2175.06
want to do it now oh

2173.079 --> 2180.599
think you can

2175.06 --> 2180.599
you think you can bypass that fate huh

2195.76 --> 2198.21
that's right the examples are great

2197.74 --> 2200.6189999999997
teachers

2198.21 --> 2204.4
[Music]

2200.619 --> 2209.1400000000003
so yeah I don't particularly like

2204.4 --> 2212.14
cruelty and I especially despise torture

2209.14 --> 2216.2799999999997
as a power tool right torture is a power

2212.14 --> 2219.339
tool of pure intimidation it's horrific

2216.28 --> 2222.2200000000003
it's gross

2219.339 --> 2225.0
but there's something to be said for

2222.22 --> 2225.0
witch burnings

2225.88 --> 2232.119
right when somebody's not just a little

2229.359 --> 2235.96
out of control they goes too far if they

2232.119 --> 2239.1400000000003
become weak distracted as a leader but

2235.96 --> 2241.8
if they just turn out to be straight on

2239.14 --> 2245.2
traitors

2241.8 --> 2247.3
literally only carry caring about the

2245.2 --> 2248.5789999999997
manipulation of their people and

2247.3 --> 2253.2400000000002
extortion

2248.579 --> 2256.3590000000004
enslavement and not actually making the

2253.24 --> 2258.8199999999997
place better ruling over people for the

2256.359 --> 2260.5
good of the people

2258.82 --> 2263.7400000000002
right that's a completely different

2260.5 --> 2265.3
story and then yeah that isn't that is a

2263.74 --> 2268.54
traitor

2265.3 --> 2271.54
it is standard policy throughout history

2268.54 --> 2273.52
and it's still the case

2271.54 --> 2276.16
it's just like oh well how do you define

2273.52 --> 2278.079
a Trader yeah you have to have actual

2276.16 --> 2280.359
National Consciousness you have to have

2278.079 --> 2283.6600000000003
recognition of that

2280.359 --> 2285.5789999999997
the traitor has had always

2283.66 --> 2289.06
been

2285.579 --> 2292.7400000000002
designated as getting the death penalty

2289.06 --> 2292.74
for a reason

2298.88 --> 2303.67
[Music]

2307.54 --> 2311.579
so yeah we'll see how long it lasts

2312.04 --> 2315.72
see how far it goes

2317.02 --> 2323.2599999999998
I don't know maybe if we just all say it

2320.8 --> 2325.42
hi politicians we're gonna torture you

2323.26 --> 2328.3
to death did I mean the [ __ ]

2325.42 --> 2331.119
Liberals are already doing that

2328.3 --> 2333.599
and they are not even intimidating

2331.119 --> 2337.96
they're just [ __ ] [ __ ] babies

2333.599 --> 2340.96
baby slaves that are enacting like

2337.96 --> 2344.26
they're on some righteous tour it is all

2340.96 --> 2347.32
a mockery of themselves I mean you can't

2344.26 --> 2349.42
seriously be intimidated by a Marxist

2347.32 --> 2352.2400000000002
leftist these days

2349.42 --> 2354.64
I mean you gotta stay away from them

2352.24 --> 2357.339
like you would stay away from a Raging

2354.64 --> 2359.44
Bull but you can't seriously be scared

2357.339 --> 2363.04
of that those people are [ __ ] out of

2359.44 --> 2364.66
their minds they have no sensory

2363.04 --> 2367.0
at all

2364.66 --> 2370.7799999999997
sensibility sensory

2367.0 --> 2374.579
senses they don't have them at all

2370.78 --> 2374.579
so it's very different

2374.68 --> 2382.5989999999997
it is very different

2376.9 --> 2385.599
a mob rule to take down the corrupted

2382.599 --> 2389.7400000000002
treacherous governments would be nothing

2385.599 --> 2392.8
like what we've seen you understand what

2389.74 --> 2395.02
the left the leftists do

2392.8 --> 2397.2400000000002
it's it's not gonna be like that it's

2395.02 --> 2399.28
not gonna even resemble that it's not

2397.24 --> 2401.56
gonna feel like that and it's not gonna

2399.28 --> 2404.5600000000004
have an influence like that it is

2401.56 --> 2408.04
completely different those are all

2404.56 --> 2411.52
mockeries those are all mimics

2408.04 --> 2414.64
of revolutionary it's all fake they're

2411.52 --> 2416.38
all drone slaves pretending to be

2414.64 --> 2419.3799999999997
revolutionaries

2416.38 --> 2422.44
you can't even compare an actual mob

2419.38 --> 2426.13
rule to that you just can't it's not

2422.44 --> 2429.32
going to be like that at all

2426.13 --> 2429.32
[Music]

2433.24 --> 2438.22

2435.76 --> 2440.619
nice oh how are we gonna do it then how

2438.22 --> 2444.16
are we gonna rain today yeah yeah let's

2440.619 --> 2445.839
get the [ __ ] politicians first yeah

2444.16 --> 2448.24
and then

2445.839 --> 2450.2799999999997
let's have a wider debate how are we

2448.24 --> 2453.339
gonna build this country now how are we

2450.28 --> 2454.48
gonna arrange the rules yeah that comes

2453.339 --> 2458.44
afterward

2454.48 --> 2461.92
it has absolutely no point whatsoever

2458.44 --> 2464.98
to start talking about that while the

2461.92 --> 2468.88
mob rule situation still has to unfold

2464.98 --> 2471.96
it is completely pointless

2468.88 --> 2476.94
it's just gonna cause friction

2471.96 --> 2476.94
distraction and ineffectiveness

2477.46 --> 2483.359
do it afterward first you take the

2479.859 --> 2489.7599999999998
politicians then you discuss

2483.359 --> 2493.0
widely how are we going to redo this now

2489.76 --> 2495.099
yeah you do that afterward you can have

2493.0 --> 2498.819
your ideas ahead of time

2495.099 --> 2501.94
but it did you gotta do the freaking

2498.819 --> 2504.22
revolution first you can't just oh I'm

2501.94 --> 2506.619
just gonna imagine the rest of my life

2504.22 --> 2509.74
of what it would be like after a

2506.619 --> 2513.6400000000003
revolution yeah that's called escapism

2509.74 --> 2516.2799999999997
it's cowardice it's just you not trying

2513.64 --> 2518.859
to focus on that moment because that

2516.28 --> 2522.52
moment is the only thing that actually

2518.859 --> 2524.68
matters not even how you're going to

2522.52 --> 2528.52
build up your country after that only

2524.68 --> 2530.7999999999997
that moment matters

2528.52 --> 2532.54
you take them down that's all that

2530.8 --> 2537.54
matters how are you going to build the

I'm going to make it happen psionically

2907.119 --> 2910.119
by example it doesn't work that way

2908.74 --> 2913.24
because as soon as you do it then

everything changes so you have to all do

energy on this happening it's something

2922.0 --> 2928.839
I wanted for a very very long time

specifically because I had the idea that

2928.839 --> 2935.5589999999997
it would probably never happen because

they didn't do [ __ ]

tolerance of evil is a mistake

not turned out the way it is if they

3157.319 --> 3162.0
hadn't

3159.24 --> 3164.819
so it's like really tough even to like

3162.0 --> 3167.579
try to find something new to talk about

3164.819 --> 3169.8
with flat Earth other than like

3167.579 --> 3171.78
psychology but yeah even the psychology

3169.8 --> 3174.059
is kind of getting getting saturated

3171.78 --> 3176.46
that's why I like to constantly now

3174.059 --> 3178.619
compare it to other fields like politics

3176.46 --> 3182.88
look at how exactly the same this works

3178.619 --> 3184.859
right because I'm already like I don't

3182.88 --> 3187.26
see any anti-flat Earth or saying

3184.859 --> 3189.859
anything that I am not able to predict

3187.26 --> 3189.8590000000004
at this point

3195.599 --> 3202.579
I don't estimate it borders boy I don't

3205.2 --> 3211.2599999999998
it's very tough to size up

3207.9 --> 3215.4
a lot of politicians

3211.26 --> 3217.559
a lot of people in places of power

3215.4 --> 3220.859
think about what type of functionaries

3217.559 --> 3223.619
go to like build a bird conferences

3220.859 --> 3225.72
and and all that sort of thing well

3223.619 --> 3228.559
that's pretty much it

3225.72 --> 3228.5589999999997
those people

3228.9 --> 3232.92
and their constituents

3230.58 --> 3235.5589999999997
[Music]

3232.92 --> 3236.64
so yeah that's potentially like a

million people

3236.64 --> 3240.54
worldwide

3238.079 --> 3242.78
or maybe even like a hundred million I

3240.54 --> 3242.7799999999997
don't know

3243.9 --> 3250.559
I can't really size that up for you

3247.14 --> 3254.24
you're gonna have to do that yourself

3250.559 --> 3254.2400000000002

you can't seriously be believing this

the time we didn't have good enough

3448.38 --> 3454.98

there's no

I'm gonna just say it like that

4047.539 --> 4052.8190000000004
very low observation right in order for

4050.18 --> 4054.5
the earth to be a ball geometrically it

isn't

4054.5 --> 4059.9
see too far without obstruction for the

earth to be a ball it's not a ball Black

4059.9 --> 4066.2000000000003
Swan it's a not a ball

4063.14 --> 4067.5789999999997
now how that works through Optics I

4066.2 --> 4070.46
don't give a [ __ ]

4067.579 --> 4075.1400000000003
it's a very complicated subject what I

4070.46 --> 4078.559
do know it's not geometric it's not

4075.14 --> 4081.92
blocking things in the distance Black

4078.559 --> 4085.099
Swan observations if it was ever

4081.92 --> 4088.839
anything physical to block things

4085.099 --> 4088.839
visually behind it

4089.24 --> 4093.14
right

4090.74 --> 4095.7799999999997
if it was that you couldn't have Black

4093.14 --> 4100.159
Swan observations but we do

4095.78 --> 4102.38
so it's not earth curve boats Don't Go

of your Optical medium IR camera things

4119.12 --> 4125.42
will simply fold a pair to fold into the

4125.42 --> 4131.96
typically by experiencing the bottom of

4129.5 --> 4134.98
the object in the distance starting to

4131.96 --> 4136.58
get obscured

4323.36 --> 4328.04
I don't use them either I don't really

4325.76 --> 4329.84
use cards I'm not a person that does

4328.04 --> 4333.14
that all the time

4329.84 --> 4335.679
we'd very rarely and I will always keep

4333.14 --> 4335.679
it that way

4355.64 --> 4360.38
I mean if we're going to do show

4357.14 --> 4363.26
together sure I will do it again like if

4360.38 --> 4366.32
I'm with somebody else then playing card

4363.26 --> 4368.54
playing cards that works fine I just

4366.32 --> 4370.699
don't ever do it on my own I really

4368.54 --> 4373.699
don't

4370.699 --> 4376.28
I don't think I've even ever done that a

4373.699 --> 4377.48
single time and it's for good reason

4376.28 --> 4380.96
because

4377.48 --> 4383.959999999999
every form of tarot or divining like

4380.96 --> 4387.38
that is potentially dangerous it is

4383.96 --> 4388.82
Christ didn't warn about it for nothing

4387.38 --> 4392.4800000000005
it is

4388.82 --> 4395.179
and I'm very sensitive and I am

4392.48 --> 4397.159
in that risk Zone

4395.179 --> 4399.62
always have been

4397.159 --> 4402.199
so that's why I don't typically do it

4399.62 --> 4405.14
and then when I do actually do it it

4402.199 --> 4408.45
works fantastically why because I never

4405.14 --> 4409.9400000000005
do it that's why it works fantastically

4446.48 --> 4452.959999999999
I try to take on the entire world

4450.14 --> 4457.04
don't I deserve some super chat for that

4452.96 --> 4460.84
I want complaints from you about how I'm

4457.04 --> 4460.84
not reading your Super Chat said well

4473.0 --> 4479.739

4476.84 --> 4479.7390000000005
it's all good

4502.159 --> 4505.659
but anyhow

4506.239 --> 4513.4
if you like what I do and you like what

4508.88 --> 4513.400000000001
I stand for and the messages that are

4513.46 --> 4521.08
controversial to say the least and

4516.34 --> 4521.08
potentially very early

4521.6 --> 4528.92
almost prophetic but not literally like

4524.78 --> 4531.259999999999
that but early I pick out things that

4528.92 --> 4533.54
it's gonna be like yes nobody's in for

4531.26 --> 4534.92
this yet but this is going to be really

4533.54 --> 4536.719
important so I'm giving you an

4534.92 --> 4538.88
opportunity to grow towards something

4536.719 --> 4541.34
that's going to be absolutely essential

4538.88 --> 4543.02
and I'm giving you like five or ten

4541.34 --> 4546.92
years heads up

4543.02 --> 4548.780000000001
that drain for that critical moment

4546.92 --> 4551.179
that's what I do

4548.78 --> 4553.46
and I could really use some financial

4551.179 --> 4557.5
support for that

4553.46 --> 4557.5
if not just as a recognition

4558.14 --> 4561.679
like hello I'm calling things very early

4560.6 --> 4565.76
here

4561.679 --> 4569.84
very very early I called the whole

4565.76 --> 4571.42
Corona [ __ ] very early immediately

4569.84 --> 4574.46
actually

4571.42 --> 4576.32
immediately said never vax ever no

4574.46 --> 4579.32
matter the circumstances always make

4576.32 --> 4582.219
sure you get fired don't ever quit

4579.32 --> 4585.699
yeah immediately

4582.219 --> 4585.699
2020 early

4587.0 --> 4593.56
I called the whole holographic nature of

4589.76 --> 4597.14
the celestials immediately

4593.56 --> 4599.06
2015-16 when people hadn't even heard of

4597.14 --> 4602.360000000001
it ever

4599.06 --> 4606.5
I call things very early

4602.36 --> 4610.5199999999995
and I'm calling mob rule to destroy

4606.5 --> 4613.219
Satan very very early

4610.52 --> 4615.26
although it could have been earlier it's

4613.219 --> 4617.42
just that now seems like the time where

4615.26 --> 4619.159000000001
the tension is building up enough for

4617.42 --> 4623.6
people to actually

4619.159 --> 4626.0599999999995
become able to grasp and take it and

4623.6 --> 4628.219
decide upon it

4626.06 --> 4630.92
because technically this should have

4628.219 --> 4632.6
happened like 20 years ago I'm not even

4630.92 --> 4635.4800000000005
joking this should have happened 20

4632.6 --> 4638.14
years ago but everyone's just

4635.48 --> 4641.9
nice and slow

4638.14 --> 4644.2390000000005
nice and slow and ignorant yeah yeah so

4641.9 --> 4647.12
it's gonna have to be now

4644.239 --> 4650.5599999999995
because we don't have

every time you talk to them every single

5373.36 --> 5379.0

5376.12 --> 5381.699
encouragement to keep coming back keep

5379.0 --> 5383.199
nagging keep rearranging whatever's

5381.699 --> 5385.12
talked about

5385.12 --> 5389.94
thing you should do in response is give

5387.58 --> 5392.739
them the Amish treatment and literally

5389.94 --> 5396.5199999999995

all they want is a piece of your soul

5481.36 --> 5486.219
all they want is a little moment in

5483.76 --> 5487.900000000001

well then don't look at it

5526.12 --> 5531.699
just look at all

that's a name that sounds like it is a

5531.699 --> 5536.5599999999995
troll sock account that means you don't

5534.4 --> 5538.54
read what they say

5536.56 --> 5540.88
and you don't address them and you

5538.54 --> 5543.28
literally forget that they might have

5540.88 --> 5545.38
been a person

5543.28 --> 5547.36
that you might have had a conversation

5545.38 --> 5551.400000000001
with because they're not they're a troll

[Music]

5555.4 --> 5561.219
and I get it if they don't like

5557.92 --> 5562.78
immediately act like trolls and you

5561.219 --> 5564.46
think you might be having a halfway

5562.78 --> 5566.199
decent conversation then I'm not gonna

5564.46 --> 5568.3
blame you if you're actually having a

5566.199 --> 5570.5199999999995
conversation but then people start

5568.3 --> 5573.34
getting deleted because they turn out to

5570.52 --> 5577.0
be anti-flat Earth or scumbag Liars

5573.34 --> 5579.46
and then suddenly new people get in

5577.0 --> 5584.5
you you know

5579.46 --> 5588.219
it's a troll sock you know it is and you

5584.5 --> 5592.719
should immediately ignore them like even

5588.219 --> 5594.58
like oh this person says hello you are a

5592.719 --> 5597.52
troll you'll hear me you [ __ ] piece

if you just say hello if you're just

5602.44 --> 5609.699
like give a smiley the timing with which

5605.8 --> 5611.860000000001

it's a sock account it's a fair yeah

5667.12 --> 5672.96
it's a sock puppet right what is a sock

5670.06 --> 5672.96
account based on

5677.219 --> 5684.58
I I'm a person I'm really a real person

5681.94 --> 5687.599999999999
on the internet yeah that's what a sock

5684.58 --> 5687.6
account is based on

5687.76 --> 5690.96
that's a sock account

5705.76 --> 5712.360000000001
yeah that's right

5708.58 --> 5713.739
you know Splat stationary and closed

5712.36 --> 5717.82
beautiful

5713.739 --> 5721.239
God's design is incredibly Dynamic and

5717.82 --> 5724.119
God is unbelievably forgiving

5721.239 --> 5727.599999999999
one could even state that once you

5724.119 --> 5730.42
realize how this world work works that

5727.6 --> 5732.1
arguably God might be a little bit too

5730.42 --> 5734.56
forgiving

5732.1 --> 5736.860000000001
that's what I think sometimes I really

5734.56 --> 5736.860000000001
do

5737.32 --> 5741.28
I think that God is a little bit too

5739.06 --> 5743.860000000001
forgiving

5741.28 --> 5746.98
but then again

5743.86 --> 5749.86
if he is you must have a damn good

5746.98 --> 5751.599999999999
reason because he is the designer of all

5749.86 --> 5754.48
things throughout time

5751.6 --> 5757.3
and he knows what he's doing

5754.48 --> 5760.48
it's just that I find

5757.3 --> 5763.1990000000005
his forgiveness a little intolerable

5760.48 --> 5763.199
sometimes

5767.6 --> 5771.589

5806.98 --> 5811.799999999999
no it's not Adam Price it is not fun

5817.78 --> 5822.4
first time ever like the first half year

5820.659 --> 5824.259999999999
you're even on the internet knowing

5822.4 --> 5826.179
about letter then to be like wow look at

5824.26 --> 5829.06
these crazy trolls that's so amusing

5826.179 --> 5830.139
yeah I've been doing this for five years

5829.06 --> 5832.96
now

5830.139 --> 5837.119
and I'm really sick of it

5832.96 --> 5837.119
I don't think they're fun at all

5838.84 --> 5844.360000000001
at all I think that these people they

5842.26 --> 5846.1
should have some actual consequences for

5844.36 --> 5848.5
what they're doing

5846.1 --> 5850.54
cyber stalking I think it should have

5848.5 --> 5853.96
serious consequences

5850.54 --> 5855.58
I think it should be very punishable

oh hey

5855.58 --> 5860.44
thank you Del West Watson

I feel better

5906.699 --> 5913.599999999999
maybe just my being generally pissed off

5910.239 --> 5916.299999999999
was just due to the financial situation

5913.6 --> 5917.7390000000005
it is really my thing it is like if I'm

5916.3 --> 5919.78
going to be stressed out because of

5917.739 --> 5922.54
finances I'm on average gonna get more

5919.78 --> 5925.659
ragey it is true

5922.54 --> 5927.4
so you could literally be my doctor and

5925.659 --> 5929.58
send me money

5927.4 --> 5932.86
and then cure

5929.58 --> 5935.159
my frustration that's literally what you

5932.86 --> 5935.159
can do

5936.219 --> 5941.9800000000005
that's right you give me money and then

5938.44 --> 5944.619
I won't ban you just yet that's right

5941.98 --> 5946.839999999999
because I'm never saying oh you did this

5944.619 --> 5948.599999999999
well that means I'm never Banning you oh

5946.84 --> 5951.76

5979.119 --> 5984.4
and like flatter Sage dude they would

5982.119 --> 5987.099999999999
have to be like they would have to

5984.4 --> 5989.379999999999
basically go completely insane over

5987.1 --> 5992.4400000000005
several days before I would even think

5989.38 --> 5994.6
of like Banning them

5992.44 --> 5996.82
but they aren't they are typically not

5994.6 --> 5999.88
doing that so

5996.82 --> 6002.58
oh yeah yeah yeah I noticed that thank

5999.88 --> 6005.76

so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6014.159 --> 6019.08
like this show

6015.9 --> 6023.099999999999
must have been Rowdy I guess

6019.08 --> 6028.199
very Rowdy the first half but I do stand

6023.1 --> 6031.92
by that and hey oh you disagree

6028.199 --> 6034.08
you disagree can you actually back up

6031.92 --> 6036.54
that disagreement with some actual

6034.08 --> 6039.239
historical references and backing and so

6036.54 --> 6040.98
that it is actually serious can you lay

6039.239 --> 6044.099999999999
down a scenario

6040.98 --> 6046.739
that this yeah that counters

6044.1 --> 6050.52
my foresight that I've shared can you

6046.739 --> 6052.5199999999995
can you actually prove me wrong using

6050.52 --> 6055.139
history

6052.52 --> 6058.619000000001
strategy all kinds of sources you can

6055.139 --> 6064.02
use to prove me wrong about my assertion

6058.619 --> 6066.9
then please I beg of you do that please

6064.02 --> 6069.540000000001
make a case share that case with me tell

6066.9 --> 6072.08
me why I'm wrong why I'm really

6069.54 --> 6075.119
absolutely

6072.08 --> 6077.88
unavoidably wrong about it tell me

6075.119 --> 6080.9
because just say oh you're just too

6077.88 --> 6083.58
angry that's not an argument yeah

6080.9 --> 6086.099999999999
you're gonna destroy it so it's not an

6083.58 --> 6089.58
argument I want to actually

6086.1 --> 6092.46
get a case to prove me wrong because I

6089.58 --> 6094.38
don't think there is one so if you have

6092.46 --> 6097.08
a actual case

6094.38 --> 6100.38
that is serious that is historical

6097.08 --> 6104.28
backing and references and quotes

6100.38 --> 6106.32
please share that with me in my comment

6104.28 --> 6108.3
section I would be very thankful for

6106.32 --> 6110.34
that if you're just going to be a sock

6108.3 --> 6112.320000000001

6110.34 --> 6115.139

6112.32 --> 6118.5599999999995
if you disagree I only care if you can

6115.139 --> 6120.84
make a really good counter argument

6118.56 --> 6124.38
that's not just basic but actually

6120.84 --> 6127.1990000000005
research that I will definitely read so

6124.38 --> 6128.52
