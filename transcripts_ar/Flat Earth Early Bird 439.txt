232.14 --> 238.11999999999998
sorry for being a little bit later just

234.22 --> 242.71
yet went off with the timing I wasn't

238.12 --> 245.65
even up that late but yeah I am kind of

242.71 --> 248.5
tired this morning partially because of

245.65 --> 250.9
the weather it's not helping getting out

248.5 --> 254.55
about that late but I don't know this

250.9 --> 258.04
new situation that's arrived since yes

254.55 --> 263.73
it's kind of wearing me down a bit

258.04 --> 263.73
I'm not happy about it a YouTube

267.71 --> 276.40999999999997
right because yes everybody might have

271.37 --> 279.71
taken notice off yesterday seems like I

276.41 --> 283.88000000000005
don't know whatever happened for at last

279.71 --> 289.00899999999996
Friday when yeah me a rant he kinda

283.88 --> 292.07
confronted QE well I didn't really get

289.009 --> 295.34000000000003
berated or anything yesterday so at

292.07 --> 300.289
least I'm happy about that but then I

295.34 --> 303.02
don't know John was quite upset and

300.289 --> 306.139
really pissed off again and he started

303.02 --> 310.60999999999996
to point out a few people among which

306.139 --> 312.849
Karen be but how they supposedly I don't

310.61 --> 314.96000000000004
know he went really nutty with it in

312.849 --> 319.82
conspiratorial saying that they were

314.96 --> 321.25899999999996
like sabotaging the argument and I

319.82 --> 324.02
thought that was kind of over the top

321.259 --> 330.139
and probably a bit paranoid

324.02 --> 335.62
and why I I yeah I talked about it I

330.139 --> 335.62
tried to kind of dispel some of the

336.039 --> 344.96
seeming conflicts and yeah I did

340.19 --> 347.51
actually talk to Karen B for quite a

344.96 --> 350.18
while over Skype and to be fair yeah

347.51 --> 353.419
look Karen B isn't exactly the easiest

350.18 --> 356.8
of persons herself not as bad as Kiwi if

353.419 --> 359.27
not a longshot but like she was kind of

356.8 --> 361.639
pissed off about it and when Karen B

359.27 --> 363.83
gets pissed off he gets very retracted

361.639 --> 365.90000000000003
so it was even kind of hard to

363.83 --> 369.889
communicate with her at that point

365.9 --> 374.50899999999996
so yeah QE definitely pissed her off but

369.889 --> 378.77
also it kind of turned out to be what I

374.509 --> 380.90000000000003
expected it to be because Karen we

378.77 --> 384.32
pretty much explained to me that she

380.9 --> 387.08
doesn't watch ball busters she doesn't

384.32 --> 391.82
watch flat earth debates and she really

387.08 --> 394.96999999999997
hasn't for for for over a month and like

391.82 --> 398.36
nothing and she kind of like I guess

394.97 --> 399.97900000000004
politically stayed away that it probably

398.36 --> 401.449
also arrives a little bit out of the

399.979 --> 404.68899999999996
hole Bob situation

401.449 --> 406.699
earlier because she just doesn't like

404.689 --> 411.52000000000004
that even if there is something to it

406.699 --> 414.11
you know she didn't like that I did that

411.52 --> 418.75899999999996
but she wasn't really angry with me she

414.11 --> 420.889
did get it but yeah she didn't listen to

418.759 --> 423.259
the show shows she hasn't kept track of

420.889 --> 425.93
the Flat Earth debate and I literally

423.259 --> 428.3
had to explain the black swan argument

425.93 --> 429.889
from scratch because she yeah as I

428.3 --> 434.389
thought she didn't she didn't understand

429.889 --> 437.15000000000003
it she didn't understand what what the

434.389 --> 439.279
fuss was about she thought like oh you

437.15 --> 442.75899999999996
have Black Swan right so the exception

439.279 --> 444.469
and it's all over the place and I had to

442.759 --> 447.529
explain that it's actually a restore

444.469 --> 451.219
historical reference because well she

447.529 --> 454.61
just hadn't noticed it's not like she

451.219 --> 457.039
she ignored it on purpose she just

454.61 --> 459.139
really didn't didn't take note of it

457.039 --> 462.74
even though yeah we did on the debates

459.139 --> 467.449
and all repeated daily everyday but yeah

462.74 --> 469.61
she didn't watch it like none of it it

467.449 --> 471.8
seems kind of odd like a lot of us yeah

469.61 --> 473.749
we I am on the debates every day a lot

471.8 --> 475.46000000000004
of you watch the debates every day just

473.749 --> 477.529
to kind of keep track know don't always

475.46 --> 481.12899999999996
agree but there's some people out there

477.529 --> 485.629
that just don't don't want to watch it

481.129 --> 487.759
so that's what happened I think it was a

485.629 --> 489.529
wide misunderstanding now this is only

487.759 --> 492.139
concerning Karen B I can't talk for

489.529 --> 496.55
younger individuals for example I can't

492.139 --> 498.529
talk for Ben because Ben and Q II have

496.55 --> 501.169
been more in communication with one

498.529 --> 503.24
another than I have with that I don't

501.169 --> 507.169
really know who Ben is I kind of seen

503.24 --> 509.27
him talk to heard him on the debates I

507.169 --> 510.02
think once or something then or was it

509.27 --> 512.12
on ball-busters

510.02 --> 514.37
but I don't really know as for the

512.12 --> 516.319
others that were involved I don't really

514.37 --> 519.769
know them either I think it probably

516.319 --> 522.68
just a misunderstanding got out of hand

519.769 --> 527.42
and it's kind of stupid but I don't

522.68 --> 529.899
think it was really enough arias so yeah

527.42 --> 532.51
I do think that QE was actually paranoid

529.899 --> 535.329
like unreasonably and

532.51 --> 544.41
I hope to dispel it I don't know if I

535.329 --> 549.43
can all right

544.41 --> 555.1899999999999
yeah that's okay grantee definitely

549.43 --> 557.92
needed hiding but ya know this is gonna

555.19 --> 559.7790000000001
go down and I'm gonna pretty much lay

557.92 --> 562.24
this down and I don't know what's gonna

559.779 --> 563.949
happen if look if there's this warpath

562.24 --> 568.449
and it's not stopping then I'm gonna

563.949 --> 570.37
step out because I don't wanna listen to

568.449 --> 573.8499999999999
that [ __ ] either if that's gonna

570.37 --> 577.66
continue you know like with Karen be at

573.85 --> 579.6990000000001
least like she she just doesn't really

577.66 --> 581.35
want to get involved in this so she I

579.699 --> 584.529
kind of asked her like would you come on

581.35 --> 589.4200000000001
the show with me to just pretty much say

584.529 --> 592.449
this kind of backed me up so that it can

589.42 --> 596.139
be highlighted that QE he really made a

592.449 --> 598.779
mistake and yeah that's a mistake is a

596.139 --> 601.54
mistake though you know I've been had

598.779 --> 603.73
moments and hasn't been for a while

601.54 --> 605.649
where I was just doing stuff I didn't

603.73 --> 607.4490000000001
feel really good it was tense and then

605.649 --> 610.81
suddenly somebody said something in a

607.449 --> 613.18
certain order in the heat of a situation

610.81 --> 616.1199999999999
and I would suddenly see that as a

613.18 --> 618.16
psychological heavy attack when it

616.12 --> 621.339
wasn't actually after an hour afterwards

618.16 --> 625.24
like wait I co totally overreacted if

621.339 --> 629.0100000000001
that's not what she or he meant and I

625.24 --> 629.01
think that is what happened to QE and

629.519 --> 635.319
yes Internet in Internet fighting in

632.649 --> 638.649
fighting it is his typical flatterers I

635.319 --> 642.2199999999999
even in a way kind of said to QE like

638.649 --> 644.199
yeah welcome to flat earth you know this

642.22 --> 648.36
is the downside of flat earth this [ __ ]

644.199 --> 648.3599999999999
happens but

648.899 --> 657.72
yeah anyway I hope that's I don't know

654.73 --> 660.85
what they'll come with it I don't know

657.72 --> 663.1600000000001
what Karen P was Duff definitely not

660.85 --> 666.399
attempting to attack the arguments he

663.16 --> 670.87
just didn't understand and understand

666.399 --> 674.23
the historical context of it she hadn't

670.87 --> 677.019
heard of that concept and I told her

674.23 --> 681.129
like yeah this is really what QE does he

677.019 --> 684.279
is putting forth academics in a way that

681.129 --> 687.61
it can spread very far and wide and even

684.279 --> 689.889
catch on to the not super niche

687.61 --> 693.5500000000001
intelligent people because it is kind of

689.889 --> 696.9590000000001
a tenable concept and it is very

693.55 --> 700.449
relevant to the to this age where

696.959 --> 703.439
deception is rife in media and all that

700.449 --> 708.4799999999999
so it's good for people to learn this

703.439 --> 711.819
even if yeah even if they're not like

708.48 --> 715.2090000000001
flat-earthers it's just a good thing to

711.819 --> 718.4799999999999
know anyway that is typically what QE

715.209 --> 722.529
does and well Karen B just doesn't

718.48 --> 726.839
really care about that too much she got

722.529 --> 730.649
the concept she thinks yeah it's just

726.839 --> 730.649
nothing super special

735.34 --> 741.88
well Randy look yeah you know their

738.91 --> 743.98
requests been out there the references

741.88 --> 747.7
are out there we're still waiting for

743.98 --> 752.47
some kind of visual backup of the of the

747.7 --> 754.3000000000001
knowing which path experiment and yeah

752.47 --> 756.5500000000001
that's a very tough one and it should be

754.3 --> 758.26
tough it's it's a very complex setup in

756.55 --> 760.29
the first place we talked about it a lot

758.26 --> 765.06
so I understand the concept completely

760.29 --> 768.76
just haven't really had any definitive

765.06 --> 772.029
data myself that made me conclude that

768.76 --> 777.36
it is absolutely undeniably real but I

772.029 --> 781.6
understand what it's supposed to be and

777.36 --> 784.99
yeah I look Randy I can I'm not gonna

781.6 --> 787.74
turn into another anon okay the issue is

784.99 --> 787.74
just out there

793.9 --> 800.1899999999999
and I am not I'm still absolutely

797.77 --> 802.63
convinced that light is not a wave so I

800.19 --> 805.72
don't know where you're going with all

802.63 --> 808.3
this Randy but you know you seem to be

805.72 --> 812.35
very eager hopping on to this ether

808.3 --> 815.4699999999999
issue the concerning light and I think

812.35 --> 819.99
that's a huge mistake because it's

815.47 --> 822.94
really false it there is no ether that

819.99 --> 824.74
that needs to be there in order for

822.94 --> 831.48
light to be a wave it's just a complete

824.74 --> 831.48
misconception ization something else

837.63 --> 846.79
right photon is an elementary particle

842.25 --> 850.0
or that is what the the particle

846.79 --> 854.41
conceptual is concerning light portray

850.0 --> 858.52
it to be they compared it to two atomic

854.41 --> 861.54
particles but it shares very little

858.52 --> 861.54
qualities with that

868.74 --> 877.509
there's no duality going on either the

873.939 --> 879.7199999999999
duality is a false dichotomy there is no

877.509 --> 879.72
duality

880.29 --> 884.0999999999999
it's simply neither

896.74 --> 909.98
think of it of like a a fruit merchant

904.01 --> 912.5889999999999
or somebody with an orchard and they

909.98 --> 916.339
have pears and they have apples you know

912.589 --> 921.2600000000001
and one day somebody brings an orange to

916.339 --> 926.5100000000001
them and they're like holy [ __ ] it it's

921.26 --> 928.91
a fruit but it's kind of different so I

926.51 --> 933.26
guess this is an apple and a pear at the

928.91 --> 936.1999999999999
same time yeah that makes sense right

933.26 --> 938.54
because apples and pears is all I know

936.2 --> 940.0400000000001
is I've been trading that all my life in

938.54 --> 943.01
Krogh them know everything about apples

940.04 --> 944.93
and pear so this thing here is

943.01 --> 947.3
completely different it must be both an

944.93 --> 948.8299999999999
orange or I mean both an apple and a

947.3 --> 952.7299999999999
pear even though in reality it's an

948.83 --> 955.1800000000001
orange that's what I think the situation

952.73 --> 955.1800000000001
is like

971.19 --> 978.3290000000001
this okay Cleary someone told you that

975.779 --> 981.93
light is a spiritual non-physical

978.329 --> 983.4899999999999
element really well I wouldn't

981.93 --> 989.1289999999999
necessarily call it spiritual because

983.49 --> 990.8100000000001
then the senses would absolutely well

989.129 --> 992.939
maybe well maybe there's something to it

990.81 --> 995.819
but it's really secondary you know what

992.939 --> 998.2199999999999
is spiritual spirituals pretty much

995.819 --> 1001.009
sensories concerning subtle energies

998.22 --> 1004.1800000000001
that are not so apparent not necessarily

1001.009 --> 1006.92
visual in the first place so who knows

1004.18 --> 1011.4799999999999
but I am pretty certain that light is

1006.92 --> 1015.31
non-physical like not in the in the

1011.48 --> 1015.3100000000001
regular atomic sense

1025.5 --> 1031.5
well a couple neck all right if we live

1029.88 --> 1035.64
on a flat plane and every pick is a

1031.5 --> 1039.809
white swan well the issue is there is no

1035.64 --> 1042.659
Black Swan if you let's say presuppose a

1039.809 --> 1046.1589999999999
flat plane and you don't really need to

1042.659 --> 1048.8090000000002
presuppose it you can just take it as is

1046.159 --> 1053.3400000000001
you see it because it's there but

1048.809 --> 1058.289
there's no Black Swan to the Flat Earth

1053.34 --> 1062.1499999999999
model as it were that's yeah it's it's

1058.289 --> 1064.9089999999999
kind of sad you know what would be

1062.15 --> 1067.98
absolutely well there would be

1064.909 --> 1070.5
potentially a Black Swan to the Flat

1067.98 --> 1073.34
Earth model and that is if there was

1070.5 --> 1075.96
footage live video footage say rocket

1073.34 --> 1078.6899999999998
going outside of the atmosphere non-stop

1075.96 --> 1082.409
shot and then as you as it leaves earth

1078.69 --> 1084.289
you can gradually see earth turning into

1082.409 --> 1086.64
a sphere beneath it

1084.289 --> 1088.71
exactly as how it's supposed to be

1086.64 --> 1091.74
visual with the scale and all that now

1088.71 --> 1093.75
that could be sort of a Black Swan to

1091.74 --> 1096.809
the Flat Earth it would kind of undo it

1093.75 --> 1098.49
but yeah it's so blatantly obvious that

1096.809 --> 1103.799
that's never gonna happen or it would

1098.49 --> 1106.32
have it's impossible they Photoshop it

1103.799 --> 1108.4089999999999
because they have to because they can't

1106.32 --> 1111.72
even get that far

1108.409 --> 1115.7700000000002
so yeah maybe there is still a potential

1111.72 --> 1117.74
black swan concerning the Flat Earth but

1115.77 --> 1120.15
yeah good luck with that

1117.74 --> 1122.4
we got the Black Swan of the globe

1120.15 --> 1125.3090000000002
though and we don't even need to go

1122.4 --> 1128.549
outside of the atmosphere or whatever go

1125.309 --> 1130.77
up there in order to get it just have to

1128.549 --> 1133.11
wait for the right day and then see so

1130.77 --> 1135.53
incredibly far that it's blatantly

1133.11 --> 1140.8799999999999
obvious that yeah there's no curvature

1135.53 --> 1143.789
an apparent horizon can loom up beyond

1140.88 --> 1147.7990000000002
an geometrical horizon that's a physical

1143.789 --> 1152.12
impossibility that's not how optics work

1147.799 --> 1152.12
that's not how those effects work

1165.51 --> 1176.34
right rentee well look the issue really

1170.73 --> 1178.14
is is the word particle in itself and

1176.34 --> 1181.77
what does it even stand for these days

1178.14 --> 1185.24
our particle has just been grown very

1181.77 --> 1191.51
close to the concept of atom particles

1185.24 --> 1195.96
it's like the meaning of it has deepened

1191.51 --> 1198.51
towards that specifically and you can

1195.96 --> 1201.95
even see the traces of it so at a point

1198.51 --> 1205.1
there had been attempts to basically

1201.95 --> 1209.3400000000001
calculate the weight of a single photon

1205.1 --> 1213.12
which would be so idiotically small that

1209.34 --> 1215.73
it's basically negligible that kind of

1213.12 --> 1218.82
thing because they needed that weight

1215.73 --> 1222.299
they needed to make it more adapting

1218.82 --> 1226.32
more uniformly a particle so they try to

1222.299 --> 1231.24
particle eyes it deeper beyond beyond

1226.32 --> 1232.95
actual sensibility so added yell I don't

1231.24 --> 1238.82
think light is a particle in the in that

1232.95 --> 1238.82
sense but it's definitely not a wave

1238.97 --> 1247.169
even though there seem to be odd

1242.309 --> 1249.44
wave-like abilities or yeah wave effects

1247.169 --> 1254.2800000000002
involved somehow

1249.44 --> 1256.47
but yeah it's always at because of

1254.28 --> 1259.11
diffraction pretty much and then ya know

1256.47 --> 1262.32
the fraction is defined as waves waves

1259.11 --> 1269.87
waves waves everywhere but is that

1262.32 --> 1269.87
really true I don't know if it is

1273.89 --> 1280.76
I mean to me it seems like the

1277.24 --> 1288.23
diffraction would be an effect the

1280.76 --> 1290.23
interaction something else and I don't

1288.23 --> 1294.4
know it's just it's not really a wave

1290.23 --> 1296.809
not in the in the sense that more

1294.4 --> 1299.51
provable waves function

1296.809 --> 1303.6499999999999
nothing like that because provable waves

1299.51 --> 1306.919
function you have through an entire

1303.65 --> 1310.5700000000002
medium and the medium is then altered

1306.919 --> 1315.5300000000002
and that alteration is where the waves

1310.57 --> 1317.45
basically form and that's not what what

1315.53 --> 1322.01
light is like light is completely

1317.45 --> 1324.23
self-sufficient it can exist probably

1322.01 --> 1326.03
even better when there is no matter but

1324.23 --> 1330.59
we still need a require matter in order

1326.03 --> 1335.02
to register it and it just has a couple

1330.59 --> 1336.74
of weird wave-like attributes as it were

1335.02 --> 1338.48
effects that can

1336.74 --> 1342.559
well that because of the definition of

1338.48 --> 1344.8700000000001
their fraction artists G is a wave but

1342.559 --> 1348.11
that doesn't mean that it is literally a

1344.87 --> 1352.12
wave that makes no sense because waves

1348.11 --> 1352.12
are secondary anyway

1354.42 --> 1357.6190000000001
[Music]

1358.619 --> 1364.4189999999999
now Randy look I don't care if you're

1361.809 --> 1367.299
gonna get all ether ish now I don't

1364.419 --> 1371.0800000000002
really respect that at all if people are

1367.299 --> 1373.299
just they talk nonsense they've gone on

1371.08 --> 1376.899
to a presupposition that is a mistake

1373.299 --> 1380.009
and that spawns the ether and then the

1376.899 --> 1384.7589999999998
fantasizing begins and it's all [ __ ]

1380.009 --> 1388.71
it's potentially more [ __ ] than

1384.759 --> 1388.71
quantum mechanics presuppositions

1389.19 --> 1396.279
because you can't yeah you can't even

1392.08 --> 1397.989
really mathematically prove it and

1396.279 --> 1401.71
quantum mechanics you can at least sort

1397.989 --> 1404.559
of mathematically prove it even though

1401.71 --> 1406.6290000000001
it is probably presuppositional in many

1404.559 --> 1408.85
ways but it just doesn't matter because

1406.629 --> 1417.84
it is about calculating the pattern of

1408.85 --> 1417.84
the outcome figuring out how anyway

1425.88 --> 1429.179
take every gas away what are you left

1428.649 --> 1432.4599999999998
with

1429.179 --> 1435.039
well you're left first off you can't

1432.46 --> 1437.08
take every gas away that's physically

1435.039 --> 1439.99
impossible and what you're left with is

1437.08 --> 1443.3799999999999
very sparse gas of all kinds especially

1439.99 --> 1445.809
the ones that are hardest to extract so

1443.38 --> 1449.94
the lower density gases are the most

1445.809 --> 1455.049
likely to remain the most afterward

1449.94 --> 1458.3500000000001
there is no space without gas there's no

1455.049 --> 1460.539
true vacuum that's purely a theoretical

1458.35 --> 1463.539
concept that's invented by the Glovers

1460.539 --> 1465.49
in the first place and even they say

1463.539 --> 1470.97
technically absolute vacuum is

1465.49 --> 1474.309
impossible so it's pointless

1470.97 --> 1477.82
there's no ether filling the space

1474.309 --> 1480.4289999999999
because then if it would be filling the

1477.82 --> 1483.1899999999998
space instead that you would are you

1480.429 --> 1487.779
really suggestion suggesting that ether

1483.19 --> 1489.909
is on par with matter and therefore can

1487.779 --> 1497.07
replace it that makes no damn sense in

1489.909 --> 1501.909
the first place literally it does it and

1497.07 --> 1504.6899999999998
that's not the way light is correlated

1501.909 --> 1510.22
with matter in the first place anyway no

1504.69 --> 1512.769
light the more matter there is the more

1510.22 --> 1517.3890000000001
light becomes absorbed distorted

1512.769 --> 1519.7
obstructed less matter there is the less

1517.389 --> 1521.9499999999998
light will be absorbed or distorted or

1519.7 --> 1525.309
obstructed and will simply carry on

1521.95 --> 1529.51
further so it a real place that makes no

1525.309 --> 1533.3799999999999
sense no there is nothing moving in its

1529.51 --> 1535.389
stead if the ether and it is purely

1533.38 --> 1537.279
conceptual at this point it is really an

1535.389 --> 1540.07
presuppositional if it is anything then

1537.279 --> 1543.549
it is just a feel a backdrop thing

1540.07 --> 1546.1899999999998
that's everywhere but I don't think it

1543.549 --> 1547.96
is that I don't think it involves itself

1546.19 --> 1550.3600000000001
with light I think that part is a pure

1547.96 --> 1552.82
misconception I think there is probably

1550.36 --> 1554.799
neither but it is electrical has nothing

1552.82 --> 1555.77
to do really with light maybe with how

1554.799 --> 1560.15
lights manner

1555.77 --> 1562.67
fast soured or something can create how

1560.15 --> 1564.95
matter can be made to create light maybe

1562.67 --> 1568.22
in some way maybe it's involved in that

1564.95 --> 1574.07
but it is not a medium for like to be a

1568.22 --> 1577.72
wave in it is such bad mistake it is it

1574.07 --> 1580.58
is like trying to ram a Lego block onto

1577.72 --> 1583.42
onto another piece of Lego when it

1580.58 --> 1585.53
clearly cannot fit and then just

1583.42 --> 1596.24
accepting that that's how it's supposed

1585.53 --> 1599.36
to be it's just not son doesn't travel

1596.24 --> 1601.97
Ian Adams son is not an object in order

1599.36 --> 1604.55
to travel through anything it's light

1601.97 --> 1607.88
it's like manifest and I don't know how

1604.55 --> 1610.78
it manifests I just know it does it's

1607.88 --> 1610.7800000000002
very consistently

1618.21 --> 1624.96
Oh God James Mason please I could that

1622.98 --> 1627.09
that troll in my comment section is

1624.96 --> 1630.6290000000001
still going on whining about Polaris

1627.09 --> 1633.509
just keeps on doing that [ __ ] like he

1630.629 --> 1638.2099999999998
really thinks he's got me now because of

1633.509 --> 1645.419
Polaris just I can't believe that they

1638.21 --> 1649.019
they really think that that it there

1645.419 --> 1651.769
that short-sighted I guess yeah it's so

1649.019 --> 1655.44
easy it's so easy to be that

1651.769 --> 1658.889
short-sighted to constantly overlook the

1655.44 --> 1661.6190000000001
presuppositions of it all and just think

1658.889 --> 1664.9189999999999
okay because this guy is not talking

1661.619 --> 1667.74
about this again because I have many

1664.919 --> 1670.7990000000002
times but because I'm not responding

1667.74 --> 1673.44
that means you have a win and the only

1670.799 --> 1677.129
thing you think you have a win is

1673.44 --> 1678.48
because you're really dumb yeah here a

1677.129 --> 1681.57
there you go you don't even know what

1678.48 --> 1683.6390000000001
presupposing is why don't you just stop

1681.57 --> 1685.619
spamming my comments section and

1683.639 --> 1688.9989999999998
actually look into some of the things

1685.619 --> 1688.999
we're talking about dumbass

1700.45 --> 1706.3400000000001
[Music]

1703.36 --> 1709.79
yeah Randy Flat Earth ambient light is a

1706.34 --> 1712.37
beam yeah it is all of it is and it

1709.79 --> 1716.48
spreads out because light can split up

1712.37 --> 1719.36
indefinitely and it will if it's not all

1716.48 --> 1721.82
uniform in one direction if it waves out

1719.36 --> 1724.34
then it will keep on splitting up and

1721.82 --> 1726.05
splitting up and splitting up until it

1724.34 --> 1729.97
becomes so weak it can no longer be

1726.05 --> 1733.96
registered that's light it's all beams

1729.97 --> 1737.0
it's just not beams of units of

1733.96 --> 1738.71
indivisible units no they are infinitely

1737.0 --> 1745.33
divisible and they can split up

1738.71 --> 1745.33
indefinitely because of it you see

1756.39 --> 1761.88
oh you are asking me what

1758.549 --> 1766.01
presuppositions WS you really need me to

1761.88 --> 1770.7
say that really well you're presupposing

1766.01 --> 1773.33
right that the stars are in fixed

1770.7 --> 1776.22
locations and that the earth is a globe

1773.33 --> 1778.77
underneath it all and that that

1776.22 --> 1780.99
correlation of the core yeah of the

1778.77 --> 1784.35
angular relations of the heavenly bodies

1780.99 --> 1786.33
prove that the earth must be a ball

1784.35 --> 1790.35
underneath because you presuppose that

1786.33 --> 1797.61
it is you don't recognize that there

1790.35 --> 1799.799
could be other relations going on yeah

1797.61 --> 1802.4099999999999
yeah it does move

1799.799 --> 1805.98
yeah Polaris move all of the heavenly

1802.41 --> 1810.63
bodies move did you know that when you

1805.98 --> 1813.3600000000001
go north and south Polaris's angle

1810.63 --> 1816.3600000000001
changes so yeah it does move it just

1813.36 --> 1819.6299999999999
doesn't rotate per default over time on

1816.36 --> 1823.1899999999998
the globe of the heavens because it is

1819.63 --> 1825.2600000000002
at the axis point of that apparent globe

1823.19 --> 1829.73
that's right

1825.26 --> 1829.73
it does move so

1832.47 --> 1838.21
Yeah right well you are presupposing

1835.629 --> 1843.61
there is a geometry involved in that the

1838.21 --> 1846.73
geometry is the reason for the globe of

1843.61 --> 1849.1
the heavens to be as it is it's like oh

1846.73 --> 1852.129
it's old it's so spherical it turns

1849.1 --> 1857.529
around us if you go this way and that

1852.129 --> 1861.039
way then it turns with us just like if

1857.529 --> 1865.33
the earth were a globe spinning

1861.039 --> 1869.08
underneath it it is yeah it's uncanny

1865.33 --> 1872.009
how much that would be like but it's not

1869.08 --> 1874.749
proof that it is like that in order for

1872.009 --> 1876.159
to think for you to think that it is a

1874.749 --> 1879.1290000000001
proof for that you will have to

1876.159 --> 1881.8890000000001
presuppose it you'll have to presuppose

1879.129 --> 1885.07
that the earth is a spinning ball

1881.889 --> 1889.33
underneath that fixed what you're gonna

1885.07 --> 1893.47
presuppose as fixed stars around the

1889.33 --> 1897.1589999999999
globe and that's how you think that

1893.47 --> 1902.289
Polaris is proof of the globe do you

1897.159 --> 1904.1190000000001
understand now ws and that's right

1902.289 --> 1907.09
perspective isn't an issue for Polaris

1904.119 --> 1909.279
none of perspective issues are involved

1907.09 --> 1911.049
in the globe of the heavens because they

1909.279 --> 1913.239
are celestial lights and there is no

1911.049 --> 1916.57
distance that be determined in the first

1913.239 --> 1919.69
place perspective doesn't come into play

1916.57 --> 1922.029
unless you can actually prove you're

1919.69 --> 1925.5700000000002
dealing with physical objects that have

1922.029 --> 1928.09
distances and therefore have sizes as is

1925.57 --> 1930.609
always involved concerning perspective

1928.09 --> 1935.259
globe of the heavens is not none of it

1930.609 --> 1938.549
it doesn't change angular size if you

1935.259 --> 1938.549
change your position on the earth

1954.379 --> 1960.32
spam the same [ __ ] over and over again

1957.22 --> 1962.33
even though I just actually entertained

1960.32 --> 1963.9189999999999
your [ __ ] for a second to try and

1962.33 --> 1965.6899999999998
explain what you're doing wrong you're

1963.919 --> 1970.5490000000002
gonna just keep on doing the same [ __ ]

1965.69 --> 1971.96
over and over again well okay if you're

1970.549 --> 1975.35
gonna do that I'm just gonna keep on

1971.96 --> 1981.47
banning you because you are a dumb [ __ ]

1975.35 --> 1984.4599999999998
and you can't listen to arguments yeah

1981.47 --> 1984.46
get out here

1985.7 --> 1991.1390000000001
so you keep on spamming my comment

1988.5 --> 1994.519
section I'll keep on deleting every

1991.139 --> 1996.9289999999999
single dumb Polaris comment you make and

1994.519 --> 1999.21
expect you to keep on doing that for

1996.929 --> 2001.46
years because you have no life you have

1999.21 --> 2003.98
no brain in order to for you to actually

2001.46 --> 2005.96
get a life because you're too dumb for

2003.98 --> 2007.22
that apparently because you can't listen

2005.96 --> 2009.3500000000001
to reason otherwise you wouldn't be

2007.22 --> 2012.6490000000001
hyping on the same freaking argument for

2009.35 --> 2016.6589999999999
months even after having been explained

2012.649 --> 2016.6589999999999
why it's wrong several times

2022.75 --> 2027.829
[Music]

2036.67 --> 2042.43
no hardly looking I don't want the

2039.76 --> 2045.1
Polaris [ __ ] to fill every freaking

2042.43 --> 2047.3500000000001
comment section my hangouts I want

2045.1 --> 2050.2599999999998
people to actually talk about the things

2047.35 --> 2053.5899999999997
that I talk about in my hangout and not

2050.26 --> 2056.11
red herring it with stupid other

2053.59 --> 2058.659
subjects that have been regurgitated to

2056.11 --> 2072.58
no end and that have already been solved

2058.659 --> 2074.77
a hundred times if you don't mind yeah

2072.58 --> 2080.62
don't you tell me what looks good hardly

2074.77 --> 2083.04
looking disingenuous [ __ ] caught you

2080.62 --> 2083.04
before

2083.81 --> 2086.929
[Music]

2094.77 --> 2108.44
yeah well the new fewer can figure out

2098.75 --> 2113.13
who I am by this yeah yeah new viewers I

2108.44 --> 2116.2400000000002
make arguments here that I don't put

2113.13 --> 2120.2400000000002
down lightly especially if I'm annoyed

2116.24 --> 2121.9799999999996
right so it you better listen if I'm

2120.24 --> 2124.68
making an argument if I'm putting it

2121.98 --> 2127.05
down on my show at my pace you better

2124.68 --> 2128.79
damn well listen you better damn well

2127.05 --> 2130.92
make notes and you better

2128.79 --> 2133.86
cross-reference it and figure it out

2130.92 --> 2137.69
because if you don't understand yet you

2133.86 --> 2140.4
feel compelled to somehow respond to it

2137.69 --> 2143.4
to get in my face yeah you will get

2140.4 --> 2146.64
banned cuz I don't have time for that

2143.4 --> 2150.2400000000002
[ __ ] look if you don't understand you

2146.64 --> 2152.0099999999998
can ask me for explanations but if you

2150.24 --> 2153.3599999999997
don't understand and you're then gonna

2152.01 --> 2156.15
insert [ __ ]

2153.36 --> 2160.6400000000003
yeah that's not that's not the way to go

2156.15 --> 2160.64
on this show just so you know

2169.45 --> 2172.739
[Music]

2194.54 --> 2206.89
I had a triple rain we

2217.4 --> 2222.4700000000003
okay well piss off then Howard more you

2220.82 --> 2226.55
were never welcome here in the first

2222.47 --> 2229.58
place because you're one of those

2226.55 --> 2231.26
spamming [ __ ] as well when you stay

2229.58 --> 2240.5
out of my comments section as well just

2231.26 --> 2244.03
go away if you can't listen to my

2240.5 --> 2246.11
arguments and you don't get it and

2244.03 --> 2249.4100000000003
you're still going to assert your

2246.11 --> 2251.78
[ __ ] concerning that without even

2249.41 --> 2253.5499999999997
trying to actually get what I'm saying

2251.78 --> 2258.4900000000002
without proving that you're trying to

2253.55 --> 2258.4900000000002
get it well then you're not welcome here

2266.07 --> 2276.3900000000003
I have no idea where Randy Wentz is

2270.29 --> 2280.31
probably maybes on the on the pre-show

2276.39 --> 2280.31
let earth debate panel or something

2284.85 --> 2288.62
alright see you still there

2295.03 --> 2301.369
yeah

2297.27 --> 2301.369
all right suit yourself

2315.14 --> 2321.019
if they're gonna be yeah if they're if

2318.95 --> 2325.1899999999996
they're not gonna take a few steps back

2321.019 --> 2327.64
and just at least be respectful towards

2325.19 --> 2331.869
me then I'll probably be out as well

2327.64 --> 2337.4
because yeah I'm not gonna just stand by

2331.869 --> 2339.589
while a senseless war is started based

2337.4 --> 2342.829
on misunderstandings and just personal

2339.589 --> 2345.319
[ __ ] I'm not gonna stand by and let that

2342.829 --> 2347.989
all just happen without trying to get

2345.319 --> 2351.589
the misconceptions out of the way but if

2347.989 --> 2353.809
they then proceeded to attack me for not

2351.589 --> 2358.069
siding with them yeah then I'm

2353.809 --> 2361.6400000000003
absolutely out absolutely out then so

2358.069 --> 2366.769
it's up to them back down and be

2361.64 --> 2368.96
sensible or you lose me and hey maybe

2366.769 --> 2372.2589999999996
they don't care I'm just an RN I'm just

2368.96 --> 2375.41
this guy are they I should be so

2372.259 --> 2378.89
thankful for them all that show should

2375.41 --> 2380.93
be so thankful like why is ridiculous

2378.89 --> 2383.089
that our win won't just fall in line

2380.93 --> 2386.3289999999997
because he has to be so thankful for it

2383.089 --> 2388.22
all right that could be a thing Nathan

2386.329 --> 2391.849
kind of already did that on Friday a

2388.22 --> 2395.45
little and yeah I'm not gonna bite for

2391.849 --> 2399.9100000000003
that either you know I helped freaking

2395.45 --> 2403.8489999999997
make the show you know my contributions

2399.91 --> 2407.359
literally echo on verbally to this day

2403.849 --> 2409.6090000000004
in the entire flat earth community so to

2407.359 --> 2411.2889999999998
say that I have everything to thank for

2409.609 --> 2414.319
the Flat Earth debates now that's

2411.289 --> 2420.529
nonsense it's a pretty balanced

2414.319 --> 2423.049
relationship I give and I get and it's

2420.529 --> 2425.18
good and I am thankful for Nathan he did

2423.049 --> 2431.359
definitely inspire me he has helped me

2425.18 --> 2433.64
develop but it's also a lot because of

2431.359 --> 2436.009
me and because of what I did

2433.64 --> 2440.69
what I did with it and the conclusions

2436.009 --> 2443.509
that I drew and the research and thought

2440.69 --> 2445.91
experiments that I have done so that

2443.509 --> 2447.29
they can peer pressure me to fall in

2445.91 --> 2452.69
line it's just not going

2447.29 --> 2455.36
happen the best they'll get out of me is

2452.69 --> 2457.28
me shutting up not responding to

2455.36 --> 2459.29
something ridiculous they say and just

2457.28 --> 2462.86
acting like it didn't happen that's the

2459.29 --> 2465.71
best they can get out of me and if they

2462.86 --> 2468.4100000000003
demand more than yeah they can go [ __ ]

2465.71 --> 2485.84
off but I'm not expecting that right

2468.41 --> 2488.81
away all right Randy okay well yeah if

2485.84 --> 2490.58
you're gonna retract anyway then yeah

2488.81 --> 2496.81
you might as well just fill it up with

2490.58 --> 2496.81
the paid work that seems sensible

2503.369 --> 2506.369
so

2539.4 --> 2542.809
it's absolutely absurd

2547.69 --> 2554.2200000000003
ya know energies yeah it seems like the

2550.45 --> 2557.6189999999997
Black Swan is very easily misinterpreted

2554.22 --> 2559.8999999999996
because it is like a literal icon by

2557.619 --> 2564.52
itself and black swans are kind of

2559.9 --> 2566.349
curious creatures so yeah I Riva even

2564.52 --> 2568.089
thought it like yeah you could have like

2566.349 --> 2571.089
it does almost seem like a secret

2568.089 --> 2573.069
society name like the Black Swan this is

2571.089 --> 2578.71
it I wouldn't be surprised if there's

2573.069 --> 2583.63
like what is it detective conspiracy or

2578.71 --> 2586.089
oriented books out there what is it like

2583.63 --> 2589.1800000000003
storybooks that would have the Black

2586.089 --> 2591.5789999999997
Swan as like a secret society I wouldn't

2589.18 --> 2595.0
be surprised at how or maybe that those

2591.579 --> 2598.3590000000004
will come but it is very easy to be used

2595.0 --> 2600.52
for such a more symbolic type of name it

2598.359 --> 2602.65
has so much energy so much mystery

2600.52 --> 2604.329
already in there even though it's not

2602.65 --> 2606.9100000000003
about the freaking Sun in the first

2604.329 --> 2608.77
place it's just a historical reference

2606.91 --> 2611.71
really it's not about this one that's

2608.77 --> 2612.21
the well that's the problem that's the

2611.71 --> 2618.789
problem

2612.21 --> 2620.7400000000002
that'll make people misunderstand the

2618.789 --> 2624.1600000000003
issue is not this one the issue was that

2620.74 --> 2627.7
originally it was thought that all swans

2624.16 --> 2629.77
were white and then a guy literally got

2627.7 --> 2632.3799999999997
a Black Swan somewhere brought it with

2629.77 --> 2634.72
him to show like no you're wrong see

2632.38 --> 2637.98
here's the Black Swan that's what it's

2634.72 --> 2642.4599999999996
about it's not about the actual Swan and

2637.98 --> 2647.309
yeah people are probably inclined to

2642.46 --> 2647.309
miss interpret what it means very easily

2649.92 --> 2655.1800000000003
secret Robert duck society I like that

2654.73 --> 2670.69
one

2655.18 --> 2674.3999999999996
enough Lane that's hilarious or just the

2670.69 --> 2674.4
rubber duck society how about that

2687.49 --> 2693.91
they did

2690.25 --> 2697.45
all right cool Randy well I appreciate

2693.91 --> 2699.79
being in that group just don't wallow

2697.45 --> 2702.8199999999997
too much in the ether nonsense because

2699.79 --> 2705.849
then I'll just leave eventually because

2702.82 --> 2709.78
I don't want this to be the giant ether

2705.849 --> 2710.53
ejaculation okay I don't want that it's

2709.78 --> 2714.4300000000003
stupid

2710.53 --> 2718.119
ether is dumb it's wrong it really is

2714.43 --> 2721.33
wrong but maybe you all just need some

2718.119 --> 2723.6400000000003
time to wallow over it have that freedom

2721.33 --> 2725.59
to fantasize about ether until you

2723.64 --> 2729.1299999999997
finally realize that it's wrong

2725.59 --> 2730.75
yes whatever but I I I don't need to go

2729.13 --> 2735.81
through all that to figure it out

2730.75 --> 2735.81
I had my ether time way back in the past

2738.21 --> 2744.4
you know did did you know Randy I

2741.82 --> 2752.19
probably never shared this before on my

2744.4 --> 2755.2000000000003
show but I think like in the late 90s I

2752.19 --> 2760.2400000000002
was confronted with the light issue

2755.2 --> 2762.58
before and then my brother very well

2760.24 --> 2764.3199999999997
explained and was very difficult for him

2762.58 --> 2768.339
but he still managed to explain to me

2764.32 --> 2772.81
why light is not a way for you and then

2768.339 --> 2775.99
I was just so shocked at figuring out

2772.81 --> 2779.44
that well that the mainstream approach

2775.99 --> 2782.02
and the data would be set that it's all

2779.44 --> 2787.03
a wave that that is kind of what shocked

2782.02 --> 2790.96
me out of it what broke me away from

2787.03 --> 2794.71
continuing studying physics because I

2790.96 --> 2800.7400000000002
was just like wow it's so brutally

2794.71 --> 2803.98
corrupted it is so harshly wrong and I

2800.74 --> 2805.99
can't deal with that so that's why I

2803.98 --> 2809.95
stepped away from the entire subject

2805.99 --> 2812.52
back in the late 90s that's why I

2809.95 --> 2815.5
probably didn't go and study physics

2812.52 --> 2821.58
because I could have it was just

2815.5 --> 2821.58
corrupted it was just corrupted badly

2822.61 --> 2832.55
scientism big-time and yeah there's no

2829.43 --> 2842.24
use trying to develop yourself within

2832.55 --> 2845.48
that when everything opposes you huh

2842.24 --> 2848.0
alright could be Mary Tyler Moore right

2845.48 --> 2850.63
yeah you're right

2848.0 --> 2850.63
weird

2862.76 --> 2866.4500000000003
alright well rent fled earth there's

2864.68 --> 2873.7999999999997
always the flutter of the early bird

2866.45 --> 2876.7999999999997
show because yeah letting people story

2873.8 --> 2879.0800000000004
out is I guess good some point it's

2876.8 --> 2880.52
gonna be good for the individuals to be

2879.08 --> 2882.619
able to get things off their chest and

2880.52 --> 2885.44
get you at least feel that they're just

2882.619 --> 2887.7200000000003
being heard as is but that's more of a

2885.44 --> 2891.41
social function as for the actual growth

2887.72 --> 2895.2999999999997
development what you do in general isn't

2891.41 --> 2897.47
all that useful it helps a little

2895.3 --> 2900.32
because it just helps bring your

2897.47 --> 2902.54
information afloat but yeah there's so

2900.32 --> 2907.6090000000004
much garbage that some of your guests

2902.54 --> 2912.14
put out rant it's but I guess that with

2907.609 --> 2917.75
most of them you know of course but Flat

2912.14 --> 2919.43
Earth debates does help build the refine

2917.75 --> 2921.71
technical understanding has helped me a

2919.43 --> 2925.8689999999997
lot I've been able to properly reflect

2921.71 --> 2925.869
my insights there

2928.07 --> 2932.5
[ __ ] off [ __ ]

2954.85 --> 2965.31
ok-ran tea Hey look go ahead you know

2960.28 --> 2968.38
nobody's gonna stop you anyway I'm not

2965.31 --> 2969.46
gonna tell you things I'm not expecting

2968.38 --> 2971.92
you to do it

2969.46 --> 2973.93
you never when you when you got an idea

2971.92 --> 2976.66
in your head you never really back down

2973.93 --> 2979.24
for anything no matter the cost so I

2976.66 --> 2981.0299999999997
wasn't expecting you to do anything else

2979.24 --> 2984.72
than what you were gonna do I'm just

2981.03 --> 2991.0
making it clear where I stand

2984.72 --> 2994.1499999999996
okay that's all and yeah I will keep on

2991.0 --> 2996.55
going on the flat earth debates for as

2994.15 --> 3000.77
long as it's tolerable but if it's just

2996.55 --> 3003.6000000000004
gonna be stupid senseless attacking or

3000.77 --> 3007.52
peer pressure nonsense assertions

3003.6 --> 3010.89
constantly then I'm out but I'm not

3007.52 --> 3012.66
expecting that to happen firsthand but

3010.89 --> 3014.6099999999997
who knows maybe I'll go on the panel in

3012.66 --> 3017.16
a few minutes and get that [ __ ] all over

3014.61 --> 3018.9900000000002
me again like how dare you try to defend

3017.16 --> 3020.97
care of your seat turn Bews [ __ ] blah

3018.99 --> 3023.93
blah blah you should know so [ __ ] yeah

3020.97 --> 3027.1099999999997
if they're gonna do that then I'm out

3023.93 --> 3029.97
absolutely and or at least gonna give

3027.11 --> 3031.82
them the back of my tongue for a moment

3029.97 --> 3034.7099999999996
and if they could continue then I'm out

3031.82 --> 3036.36
but let's hope they don't do that let's

3034.71 --> 3037.98
hope they actually listen to the

3036.36 --> 3039.81
beginning of my show where I explain

3037.98 --> 3044.88
exactly what happened and my

3039.81 --> 3047.04
communications with Karen and hey look

3044.88 --> 3049.11
even if I'm out of Fe D you know I'll

3047.04 --> 3052.35
still do the early bird show I still

3049.11 --> 3054.4500000000003
need to do this still progress research

3052.35 --> 3057.0899999999997
I'll probably even still watch the FE D

3054.45 --> 3058.97
here and there it's just tuned out more

3057.09 --> 3062.3900000000003
cuz don't want to waste my time with

3058.97 --> 3062.39
yelling all the time

3064.74 --> 3072.9399999999996
but yeah we'll see what happens I'm

3069.22 --> 3075.37
pretty neutral with this I just think

3072.94 --> 3077.26
there's no use in starting some kind of

3075.37 --> 3080.0499999999997
in fight in fighting over

3077.26 --> 3082.3
misunderstanding not everybody likes

3080.05 --> 3086.28
each other that's blatantly obvious and

3082.3 --> 3090.01
you shouldn't use that as an excuse to

3086.28 --> 3092.6200000000003
aggravate things it just should use it

3090.01 --> 3095.0200000000004
in the sense that you keep it in the

3092.62 --> 3097.15
back of your minds in order to not poke

3095.02 --> 3100.15
people too much before things get out of

3097.15 --> 3102.13
hand because we are all trying to do our

3100.15 --> 3104.14
own thing our own developments in our

3102.13 --> 3107.2000000000003
own directions some of which may be

3104.14 --> 3109.45
wrong and some of which just need to be

3107.2 --> 3112.72
done because people need to personally

3109.45 --> 3114.6699999999996
figure things out and that's why they

3112.72 --> 3117.0699999999997
may be going on a wrong path for a while

3114.67 --> 3119.9500000000003
even very passionately hey I went on the

3117.07 --> 3122.8300000000004
gravity remember and what's very serious

3119.95 --> 3125.5
that wasn't a joke that wasn't a joke to

3122.83 --> 3129.6
me so everybody goes their own path it's

3125.5 --> 3135.16
just a matter of don't make things worse

3129.6 --> 3139.06
by giving in to personal issues with one

3135.16 --> 3140.6499999999996
another that's all anyway I'm gonna
