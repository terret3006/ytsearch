good

65.119 --> 69.68
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

94.88 --> 102.88
that would be much appreciated

98.079 --> 102.88
so turned around somewhat

104.72 --> 108.56
it's kind of stormy again

108.88 --> 112.079
less clouds but still quite a few and

111.52 --> 115.2
nice

112.079 --> 117.439
clear blue spots in between it's a bit

115.2 --> 120.399
of sun earlier right now the clouds are

117.439 --> 120.39899999999999
in front of the sun

121.28 --> 125.68
very beautiful cloud formations out

126.84 --> 132.08
there yeah outside it's a little fresh

129.84 --> 135.04
when the sun's not out but

132.08 --> 135.04000000000002
a little chilly

135.2 --> 142.72
but overall it's actually still kind of

137.2 --> 146.72
nice and warm

142.72 --> 146.72
a bit of a restless day i think

147.92 --> 150.319
right

154.84 --> 157.84
so

159.76 --> 166.879
it's tuesday the 25th

162.8 --> 166.87900000000002
of may 2021

169.28 --> 175.04
yeah it seems like for some reason

172.64 --> 176.95899999999997
this almost the entire month like on a

175.04 --> 180.159
regular basis i

176.959 --> 182.239
accidentally say it's april

180.159 --> 184.0
i don't know why i keep it's like it's

182.239 --> 187.76
happened like three or four times

184.0 --> 191.04
now it's weird i just keep saying

187.76 --> 194.159
april even though it's may it's may

191.04 --> 194.159
stop saying april

195.519 --> 200.48000000000002
of course trolls and comments like to

197.599 --> 204.72
remind me about that

200.48 --> 207.44
because yeah when i'm actually right

204.72 --> 208.72
about a lot of things then of course

207.44 --> 211.92
when i make

208.72 --> 212.56
silly semantic mistakes then of course

211.92 --> 216.23899999999998
you gotta

212.56 --> 218.0
hang all weight on that otherwise yeah

216.239 --> 221.84
you'll feel like you have no point

218.0 --> 225.92
so i totally get that why they do that

221.84 --> 227.76
funny thing is though that i use that

225.92 --> 229.92
what they do

227.76 --> 231.67999999999998
what they try to do to gas like me make

229.92 --> 235.83999999999997
me feel stupid i just

231.68 --> 239.43900000000002
use it to improve myself

235.84 --> 242.64000000000001
huh hello

239.439 --> 245.28
that flat fellow first in chat yeah a

242.64 --> 245.27999999999997
little late

245.519 --> 250.0
steamy traveler good to see you rob h

248.159 --> 253.76
good to see you

250.0 --> 256.799
it's almost you now well yeah

253.76 --> 256.799
another week or so

260.799 --> 264.79999999999995
oh man yesterday at this really special

263.28 --> 267.84
moment outside it was

264.8 --> 271.199
quite spectacular

267.84 --> 274.32
wish could have like quickly grabbed

271.199 --> 276.56
p900 or something to film it but it's

274.32 --> 278.24
takes such a long time to start it up

276.56 --> 280.639
and everything and probably the battery

278.24 --> 280.639
is not

280.84 --> 287.59999999999997
optimal that it was a short

283.759 --> 290.47900000000004
window of time

287.6 --> 292.08000000000004
like a minute but i was basically just

290.479 --> 297.12
out there

292.08 --> 300.4
on the roof smoking uh smoking a spliff

297.12 --> 305.12
and then like it was kind of clear

300.4 --> 308.23999999999995
and then like this huge huge

305.12 --> 308.479
billowing cloud came literally rolling

308.24 --> 311.28000000000003
in

308.479 --> 312.32
it i haven't seen such a thing up close

311.28 --> 316.96
in a long time

312.32 --> 320.639
it was very spectacular it was like

316.96 --> 322.479
like this wave of of like really dark

320.639 --> 324.639
billowing cloud and

322.479 --> 326.639
what you could see by the parts of the

324.639 --> 330.08
cloud that it was literally like

326.639 --> 332.639
rolling rolling

330.08 --> 332.639
forward

334.08 --> 340.56
and like a like a big wave

337.12 --> 343.68
a wall of cloud just came rolling in

340.56 --> 346.24
i was expecting that yeah it would

343.68 --> 347.84000000000003
start to pour rain out of it but it

346.24 --> 350.0
didn't actually do that

347.84 --> 351.19899999999996
just a couple of drops but it it

350.0 --> 354.4
literally just came

351.199 --> 356.56
rolling over and it was there outside

354.4 --> 358.63899999999995
just kind of like

356.56 --> 360.639
embracing the moment literally standing

358.639 --> 364.40000000000003
out there with my arms

360.639 --> 365.36
to feel it because it was so spectacular

364.4 --> 367.84
i could feel

365.36 --> 369.759
like how i could almost like feel the

367.84 --> 372.79999999999995
pressure dynamics happening

369.759 --> 376.319
trying to imagine it in my head

372.8 --> 378.84000000000003
and just seeing what's out there

376.319 --> 380.40000000000003
it was just it was really spectacular i

378.84 --> 382.23999999999995
thought

380.4 --> 384.23999999999995
wish i could have filmed it but probably

382.24 --> 387.28000000000003
the camera wouldn't have picked it up

384.24 --> 389.84000000000003
you know cameras don't really see 3d

387.28 --> 389.84
and all that

390.479 --> 396.31899999999996
but just to see like behind me

394.24 --> 398.56
everything being clear then a bunch of

396.319 --> 402.40000000000003
like little sheep clouds

398.56 --> 404.4
and behind that thicker like hazy

402.4 --> 405.52
already kind of grayish clouds and

404.4 --> 410.71999999999997
behind that

405.52 --> 413.12
like this outstanding wall

410.72 --> 414.639
of like really dark cloud that was

413.12 --> 418.319
literally just moving

414.639 --> 420.639
like upwards and behind it downwards

418.319 --> 422.8
so it was literally just rolling on and

420.639 --> 425.919
behind that big

422.8 --> 429.199
cloud banks but not as

425.919 --> 431.84
much as that wave cloud

429.199 --> 432.639
that literally just came rolling in it

431.84 --> 434.31899999999996
was

432.639 --> 436.0
it was quite spectacular i really

434.319 --> 439.68
remember that i wanted to share that

436.0 --> 439.68
moment descriptive wise

442.56 --> 446.479
hello furby xl

446.8 --> 454.56
is that really a real name

450.56 --> 456.72
or whatever uh

454.56 --> 456.72
so

458.16 --> 464.47900000000004
anyway yesterday

461.28 --> 467.75899999999996
was a lot of fun on the flatter debates

464.479 --> 469.599
i went full on baller

467.759 --> 471.199
well dude i should really start making

469.599 --> 479.84
notes again this has been

471.199 --> 479.84000000000003
like since saturday

485.039 --> 491.52
but yeah i put down a whole train of

489.199 --> 495.52000000000004
baller reasoning

491.52 --> 499.12
to basically bypass

495.52 --> 501.12
well locally flat curve function

499.12 --> 503.52
collapse

501.12 --> 505.36
because yeah if you're going to use

503.52 --> 508.56
optics

505.36 --> 510.72
to try and prove the earth is a ball

508.56 --> 511.68
it never works out because as soon as

510.72 --> 515.279
you can see

511.68 --> 519.519
far then yeah the geometry doesn't

515.279 --> 522.08
match the site

519.519 --> 523.519
and that's i think why randy kind of

522.08 --> 527.36
like tried to

523.519 --> 530.32
maneuver in locally flat idea

527.36 --> 533.12
based on several cross references

530.32 --> 536.32
probably because of

533.12 --> 541.76
the the concept of level

536.32 --> 541.7600000000001
and uh they call them again

542.0 --> 546.399
yes it was a natural cloud formation rob

544.24 --> 546.399
h

546.56 --> 549.8389999999999
there's no trails anywhere

551.76 --> 558.64
uh land surveyors

556.16 --> 559.68
right the idea probably came from that

558.64 --> 561.68
to combine it

559.68 --> 563.76
ignore everything else locally flat and

561.68 --> 566.4799999999999
then i expanded upon it with a bit of

563.76 --> 566.48
science fiction

566.8 --> 572.0799999999999
based on quantum mechanics experiments

569.92 --> 574.16
just the idea of it and i thought like

572.08 --> 577.44
yeah yeah that way

574.16 --> 581.12
you can still make ballers believe

577.44 --> 585.6
it's a bow but relinquish

581.12 --> 587.839
that it cannot be measured as it were

585.6 --> 590.48
that when you try to test it it's not

587.839 --> 592.1600000000001
there but still hold on to it

590.48 --> 593.6800000000001
and kind of like because that

592.16 --> 596.48
situation's been out there

593.68 --> 598.399
i just created kind of a i painted a

596.48 --> 602.0
framework for it

598.399 --> 605.279
to kind of legitimize

602.0 --> 608.0
the positions

605.279 --> 608.8
it yeah i don't know makes me really

608.0 --> 610.48
feel like i'm an

608.8 --> 612.399
artist or something i don't know what it

610.48 --> 613.12
is but i think it's a lot of fun to do

612.399 --> 617.2
that and i'm

613.12 --> 617.68
i can do it it's almost like oh this is

617.2 --> 620.8000000000001
my

617.68 --> 622.079
lifelong dream from 20 years ago to be

620.8 --> 625.68
like

622.079 --> 626.16
a baller scientist except i didn't want

625.68 --> 628.4799999999999
to be

626.16 --> 630.399
like a really disgusting liar that's

628.48 --> 632.0
everything oh it's all about ego because

630.399 --> 635.44
even back then that was like the

632.0 --> 636.079
thing it's all about ego like oh you're

635.44 --> 639.2790000000001
smart

636.079 --> 641.519
well then you have to

639.279 --> 641.519
like

642.88 --> 646.399
hold on to your idea so they don't get

645.36 --> 648.16
stolen

646.399 --> 649.6
right that sort of thing to really be

648.16 --> 653.04
like hey my dear

649.6 --> 656.88
it was so annoying back then when i

653.04 --> 659.1999999999999
i've always been kind of like

656.88 --> 660.48
a christian scientist as i thought it

659.2 --> 663.279
like like no

660.48 --> 666.399
information is there to open up for

663.279 --> 670.399
everybody and when everybody gets it

666.399 --> 672.88
gets availability to the information

670.399 --> 674.0
then they have the opportunity to get

672.88 --> 676.959
out of it better

674.0 --> 678.0
and that's what we all need when

676.959 --> 682.8
somebody really

678.0 --> 686.079
improves gets a better footholding

682.8 --> 688.88
in the world with their consciousness

686.079 --> 690.0
it helps everybody especially onto the

688.88 --> 693.76
future

690.0 --> 696.8
and that's kind of been my philosophy

693.76 --> 698.399
with science even before i really kind

696.8 --> 702.16
of understood

698.399 --> 704.56
christianity more up close started to

702.16 --> 705.519
look beyond just like the priesthoods

704.56 --> 708.64
that i thought were

705.519 --> 710.72
hypocrites and all that

708.64 --> 713.279
that kind of made me step away from the

710.72 --> 716.1600000000001
community of christianity

713.279 --> 719.2
and i've come back in my own way and in

716.16 --> 721.92
an eclectic way

719.2 --> 723.0400000000001
but yeah it matches like that's where

721.92 --> 725.279
science and

723.04 --> 726.56
spirituality has eventually started

725.279 --> 730.0
bridging because

726.56 --> 733.1199999999999
from a christian perspective doing that

730.0 --> 736.72
is totally logical and i even

733.12 --> 740.72
see as like the truth and awakening is

736.72 --> 743.9200000000001
is is critical

740.72 --> 744.639
to christ's jesus christ's position and

743.92 --> 746.7199999999999
his words

744.639 --> 748.0790000000001
reveal that everything reveals it's

746.72 --> 751.44
always finding the way

748.079 --> 754.6389999999999
through lifting people up

751.44 --> 758.0790000000001
so that they may carry

754.639 --> 761.76
those the others

758.079 --> 765.8389999999999
right and maybe even carry you

761.76 --> 768.959
further up so that's where it kind of

765.839 --> 768.9590000000001
bridged all together

771.519 --> 776.5600000000001
and now i'm living my dream of being a

774.48 --> 778.88
baller

776.56 --> 780.3199999999999
but yeah kind of like in a controlled

778.88 --> 782.639
way in a flat earth or

780.32 --> 784.399
prison what the ballers would argue

782.639 --> 787.519
because they think it's a prison but

784.399 --> 790.56
it's not really a prison it's like a

787.519 --> 790.5600000000001
it's more like a

790.8 --> 795.76
a golden cage or a small little palace

794.24 --> 800.88
and i can literally just

795.76 --> 804.639
step out of it act like a baller

800.88 --> 807.92
but when truly tested i would relinquish

804.639 --> 810.9590000000001
the truth the flat earth truth the

807.92 --> 814.399
yeah for as far as information

810.959 --> 817.8389999999999
is within reach

814.399 --> 821.199
but it works because paul belief

817.839 --> 823.519
right bo anybody can believe the ball

821.199 --> 825.279
it's only when you try to reify it into

823.519 --> 828.48
reality

825.279 --> 830.48
other than through mind games and then

828.48 --> 832.24
hold on to that reification that you

830.48 --> 835.6
really got the problem that you really

832.24 --> 835.6
step away from the truth

836.24 --> 843.519
right so i guess that my efforts are

838.079 --> 847.04
part of the dual cosmo conical society

843.519 --> 847.04
to diffuse

847.199 --> 852.16
the weight through their own ego

850.32 --> 854.1600000000001
and their own issues that a lot of

852.16 --> 858.24
ballers tend to hang on

854.16 --> 861.8389999999999
to their religion put it on there

858.24 --> 865.36
as a weight to keep them there

861.839 --> 869.6
they use the the ball belief

865.36 --> 873.36
as a wall to protect inquiry

869.6 --> 875.0400000000001
into their personal affairs in ways

873.36 --> 877.279
to themselves right to their own

875.04 --> 879.36
consciousness

877.279 --> 881.68
and i'm trying to kind of dispel that so

879.36 --> 884.72
that it can just be used

881.68 --> 887.76
as an interesting tool for

884.72 --> 890.639
consciousness physics

887.76 --> 890.639
exploration

891.36 --> 896.0
right so that we can like even after

894.24 --> 899.44
it's concluded that the earth is

896.0 --> 901.199
flat truly and doesn't work like

899.44 --> 903.6
the only ballers they might go

901.199 --> 906.4799999999999
completely solipsistic or whatever

903.6 --> 908.72
they're really bad ones but that most

906.48 --> 912.24
would just agree yeah it's fine

908.72 --> 914.639
but still you know what if it was a ball

912.24 --> 915.839
it's interesting to think about also

914.639 --> 918.0
like

915.839 --> 919.6
yeah it's just an easy game like okay we

918.0 --> 922.0
know the earth is flat

919.6 --> 924.48
but what if it was a ball what would

922.0 --> 926.399
happen if the earth was a ball according

924.48 --> 928.32
to heliocentrism right

926.399 --> 930.16
then you go through it every step

928.32 --> 933.519
there's all these mistakes

930.16 --> 936.959
so it's almost like a great

933.519 --> 940.16
picture of errors that you could learn

936.959 --> 943.92
from and to test your

940.16 --> 946.48
insight right would you then

943.92 --> 948.88
throw it all away because it's wrong or

946.48 --> 952.48
would you keep it around

948.88 --> 956.8
as a as a learning tool

952.48 --> 956.8000000000001
to get debating to get thinking

958.0 --> 962.399
what if the earth was a ball right

964.72 --> 967.12
anyway

967.839 --> 971.6800000000001
it was good to do that on the flat earth

969.44 --> 974.9590000000001
debate yesterday

971.68 --> 974.959
i was very amused

976.0 --> 980.24
i hope others appreciate my efforts as

978.56 --> 983.8389999999999
well

980.24 --> 983.839
though you might think it's a bit weird

984.88 --> 995.12
uh hello george sanford tom parker

991.279 --> 997.6
seeking star water gary

995.12 --> 997.6
benga

1003.92 --> 1011.8389999999999
david weiss at an interview okay i

1006.399 --> 1011.839
didn't pick up on that

1022.839 --> 1025.839
so

1032.24 --> 1036.48
right so any feedback would be great

1037.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
hmm

1075.679 --> 1082.88
right not much

1080.559 --> 1082.8799999999999
uh

1092.48 --> 1095.919
yeah i spend a lot of i remember again

1094.4 --> 1099.039
yeah i spent a lot of time

1095.919 --> 1100.3200000000002
i watched some info wars i also spent a

1099.039 --> 1104.48
lot of time just

1100.32 --> 1106.799
playing a game and then it

1104.48 --> 1108.08
was very entertaining and then suddenly

1106.799 --> 1111.36
a whole bunch of hours

1108.08 --> 1113.76
passed so

1111.36 --> 1117.039
yeah i didn't manage to get to bed too

1113.76 --> 1117.039
early unfortunately

1117.2 --> 1123.679
but at least it wasn't like five o'clock

1120.24 --> 1136.96
took a shower

1123.679 --> 1140.0
i do feel well rested today

1136.96 --> 1142.72
right so yeah how are you guys and gals

1140.0 --> 1142.72
all doing

1144.32 --> 1150.0
i'm pretty much open for any subject

1147.36 --> 1152.799
yesterday's show was by the way very

1150.0 --> 1152.799
happy about it

1153.679 --> 1162.16
lots of giants lots of giant talk

1158.08 --> 1166.799
pretty much laid down everything

1162.16 --> 1166.799
i've gathered so far about that subject

1177.84 --> 1184.0
doing the glow believer imitation like

1180.96 --> 1184.0
suffering the fools

1186.4 --> 1188.72
what

1190.64 --> 1206.7990000000002
hello iron fe by the way but

1194.32 --> 1208.799
trying to figure out is that a question

1206.799 --> 1210.1589999999999
right but as a global believer i don't

1208.799 --> 1213.28
necessarily

1210.159 --> 1213.6000000000001
suffer the fools because just because i

1213.28 --> 1215.84
am

1213.6 --> 1218.32
championing the idea the earth might be

1215.84 --> 1218.32
a globe

1218.559 --> 1224.1589999999999
doesn't mean that i'm going to tolerate

1221.36 --> 1226.9599999999998
the bad behavior of ballers

1224.159 --> 1230.3200000000002
i'd rather take in the position where

1226.96 --> 1232.32
i'm like no no you don't understand

1230.32 --> 1234.1589999999999
how you're supposed to really act as a

1232.32 --> 1237.039
baller like

1234.159 --> 1238.0800000000002
taking it more serious as a religion

1237.039 --> 1241.2
almost like no

1238.08 --> 1242.1589999999999
no it doesn't work like that you're not

1241.2 --> 1244.32
supposed to

1242.159 --> 1246.48
act like this you're supposed to correct

1244.32 --> 1249.76
yourself and trust that there's always a

1246.48 --> 1253.3600000000001
way through for the ball

1249.76 --> 1256.559
and i literally put the deed to that

1253.36 --> 1260.32
to that word to that idea

1256.559 --> 1262.96
i show it like okay this is incorrect

1260.32 --> 1265.4399999999998
it's like so probably wrong that even

1262.96 --> 1267.679
like the machinations don't work anymore

1265.44 --> 1271.44
have been unraveled well then you move

1267.679 --> 1274.5590000000002
on to another position

1271.44 --> 1277.28
and admit every now and then

1274.559 --> 1280.1589999999999
when you did make a mistake because even

1277.28 --> 1283.44
as a baller making a mistake

1280.159 --> 1286.96
is still an honor to admit if you're

1283.44 --> 1286.96
able to move on from that

1287.76 --> 1291.6
but this seems to be a big problem for a

1289.679 --> 1295.52
lot of ballers the trenchers

1291.6 --> 1297.9189999999999
like they have this image this

1295.52 --> 1298.72
idea that they're always right and that

1297.919 --> 1301.8400000000001
they can never

1298.72 --> 1303.3600000000001
admit to mistakes and that's kind of

1301.84 --> 1306.9599999999998
foolish

1303.36 --> 1306.9599999999998
it's foolish to think like that

1316.84 --> 1319.84
anyway

1326.32 --> 1332.1589999999999
oh my thoughts on eldorado the lost city

1329.76 --> 1336.64
of gold oh sheesh

1332.159 --> 1340.88
oh i had some weird ideas about that one

1336.64 --> 1340.88
like really weird dark world ideas

1341.28 --> 1353.039
did i ever share i think i did that

1346.799 --> 1353.039
2000 no 1997

1353.12 --> 1358.4799999999998
like in like the first time

1356.48 --> 1360.08
that i kind of like consciously in the

1358.48 --> 1362.96
physical world

1360.08 --> 1364.48
took ayahuasca because that [ __ ] i guess

1362.96 --> 1367.76
happened before

1364.48 --> 1368.72
but it's like in in the big when i first

1367.76 --> 1372.4
broke open

1368.72 --> 1374.96
like i on the other side i i was very

1372.4 --> 1377.2800000000002
fascinated by el dorado

1374.96 --> 1379.6000000000001
and i saw it in the distance because

1377.28 --> 1382.08
when i came out i came out into like

1379.6 --> 1386.799
this big tropical forest

1382.08 --> 1390.3999999999999
environment on the other side

1386.799 --> 1390.4
and then i saw like

1391.2 --> 1398.799
sort of this golden shiny pyramidal

1395.44 --> 1401.2
structure sticking out out of the

1398.799 --> 1402.799
jungle into the distance and i really

1401.2 --> 1405.679
wanted to go there but

1402.799 --> 1405.679
yeah then

1406.0 --> 1409.039
something approached me there on the

1408.08 --> 1411.76
other side

1409.039 --> 1416.72
and drew me away to other things

1411.76 --> 1421.52
actually started this

1416.72 --> 1421.52
talk to me about well this sort of thing

1423.679 --> 1430.64
yeah about physics what's really odd

1426.88 --> 1432.64
like he took me through the school

1430.64 --> 1434.24
because yeah it happened in school it's

1432.64 --> 1436.0
totally insane

1434.24 --> 1437.36
right i didn't know what what the hell

1436.0 --> 1439.679
was going on

1437.36 --> 1442.84
i didn't even know what it was it it was

1439.679 --> 1444.159
so crazy the entire situation was quite

1442.84 --> 1446.9599999999998
crazy

1444.159 --> 1448.96
but on the other side first i saw was in

1446.96 --> 1451.039
the forest so i kind of held around in

1448.96 --> 1454.799
the distance wanted to go there

1451.039 --> 1458.48
and he said no you're no

1454.799 --> 1460.72
you're not allowed there and i

1458.48 --> 1463.1200000000001
i listened because i didn't know what

1460.72 --> 1466.559
the hell was going on and then

1463.12 --> 1468.6399999999999
the environment switched to the school

1466.559 --> 1470.799
but it wasn't literally the school it

1468.64 --> 1472.3200000000002
was comprised

1470.799 --> 1475.039
the environment i was in wasn't

1472.32 --> 1476.3999999999999
literally the architecture of the school

1475.039 --> 1481.12
building

1476.4 --> 1484.159
but it it was comprised of

1481.12 --> 1486.799
the typical design

1484.159 --> 1487.7600000000002
of it so it was like a rearranged

1486.799 --> 1490.4
building

1487.76 --> 1492.08
larger in some parts like completely

1490.4 --> 1495.3600000000001
metamorphized but still

1492.08 --> 1496.72
recognizable as that location it's like

1495.36 --> 1499.12
those types of curtains

1496.72 --> 1500.96
and those types of wood panels those

1499.12 --> 1504.559
types of

1500.96 --> 1508.32
tables and all that very fascinating

1504.559 --> 1509.84
and there were like glass showcases with

1508.32 --> 1513.52
objects

1509.84 --> 1517.36
and devices and machines and basically

1513.52 --> 1519.9189999999999
going through physics

1517.36 --> 1521.4399999999998
like he was trying to test me on my

1519.919 --> 1524.0
physics knowledge i think and

1521.44 --> 1524.64
instruct me a little and yeah but also

1524.0 --> 1527.44
with that

1524.64 --> 1528.48
like testing the machinations how easily

1527.44 --> 1531.919
would i

1528.48 --> 1534.159
reify things and i didn't know

1531.919 --> 1536.64
back then but to remember that quite

1534.159 --> 1539.8400000000001
fascinating but yeah right before that

1536.64 --> 1543.3600000000001
i did see eldorado in the distance

1539.84 --> 1547.12
now whether it's a physical real place

1543.36 --> 1547.12
i kind of highly doubt it

1547.279 --> 1552.88
and i think that if it was ever found it

1550.0 --> 1556.24
would have probably been

1552.88 --> 1558.0
they would have whoever found it

1556.24 --> 1559.76
would have attempted to kept keep it

1558.0 --> 1563.039
secret and then eventually

1559.76 --> 1567.039
the empire or like the nobility the

1563.039 --> 1568.799
the controllers now the dark ones

1567.039 --> 1571.279
would have probably just stripped the

1568.799 --> 1574.32
whole place

1571.279 --> 1578.48
like all of it and

1574.32 --> 1578.48
yeah build a giant

1578.559 --> 1587.76
pile of gold out of it for their empire

1584.48 --> 1590.559
but did they ever find it

1587.76 --> 1591.84
it could be [ __ ] simply that it's always

1590.559 --> 1595.36
been kind of like

1591.84 --> 1597.52
on the other side a thing that if you

1595.36 --> 1599.039
get in touch with hallucinogenics that

1597.52 --> 1603.039
you get to see

1599.039 --> 1603.44
it almost like a symbol on the other

1603.039 --> 1605.76
side

1603.44 --> 1606.64
rather than something that's literally

1605.76 --> 1610.84
there

1606.64 --> 1614.0
and i've reasoned out through early

1610.84 --> 1614.799
ideas about my dark world experience

1614.0 --> 1617.76
that maybe

1614.799 --> 1618.1589999999999
it's like something in another dimension

1617.76 --> 1622.72
that's

1618.159 --> 1624.8400000000001
literally there in the other dimension

1622.72 --> 1626.08
that it's like some kind of a weird

1624.84 --> 1630.08
heaven

1626.08 --> 1633.9189999999999
location that's been built

1630.08 --> 1633.9189999999999
by all kinds of people

1634.08 --> 1640.96
over the ages like a heaven that's been

1638.0 --> 1642.399
built on the other side by people now of

1640.96 --> 1646.799
course that doesn't make it the

1642.399 --> 1650.0
actual scriptural biblical heaven

1646.799 --> 1654.24
but it's still like with that idea

1650.0 --> 1657.279
maybe it was built by people

1654.24 --> 1658.48
on the other side perhaps not entirely

1657.279 --> 1662.08
by people maybe

1658.48 --> 1665.1200000000001
entities that are native

1662.08 --> 1665.12
to the other side

1665.36 --> 1669.84
had a hand in that as well right

1673.2 --> 1677.1200000000001
wow robert you thought akumavar was a

1675.84 --> 1679.039
credible guy

1677.12 --> 1680.7199999999998
oh my god well you didn't pay too much

1679.039 --> 1681.36
attention because he's been around for

1680.72 --> 1684.88
quite a while

1681.36 --> 1684.8799999999999
and wow and he is

1686.32 --> 1692.399
he's just a total [ __ ]

1689.6 --> 1693.1999999999998
like one of those that's always friendly

1692.399 --> 1697.279
but never

1693.2 --> 1699.44
genuine i can't stand the guy

1697.279 --> 1711.84
i think he's i think he really is a

1699.44 --> 1711.8400000000001
terrible pierced person

1717.6 --> 1724.48
right and he's not just the globe zealot

1721.12 --> 1726.8799999999999
like he's just an overall terrible

1724.48 --> 1726.88
person

1737.84 --> 1741.9189999999999
like and he is so annoying like him

1740.64 --> 1744.96
calling himself

1741.919 --> 1748.24
a mathematician and

1744.96 --> 1751.679
he's the worst he can't do

1748.24 --> 1767.84
[ __ ] he can't even do basic calculus

1751.679 --> 1767.8400000000001
like he is the worst

1776.24 --> 1795.84
anyway steamy traveler i hope i uh

1780.399 --> 1795.84
answered your question to satisfaction

1811.679 --> 1813.919
right

1816.159 --> 1821.679
also just realize like how the minds of

1818.96 --> 1825.039
people also work right

1821.679 --> 1828.88
so if somebody just

1825.039 --> 1830.0
anybody out there from somewhere else

1828.88 --> 1832.96
you didn't know

1830.0 --> 1833.279
would come up to you and you're like not

1832.96 --> 1836.32
too

1833.279 --> 1836.88
aware about people lying and stuff about

1836.32 --> 1840.1589999999999
things

1836.88 --> 1842.3200000000002
and they told you like whoa dude

1840.159 --> 1844.72
somebody told me there's like this city

1842.32 --> 1845.6
of gold somewhere in a tropical region

1844.72 --> 1847.679
but

1845.6 --> 1849.6789999999999
it's all hidden and there's all kind of

1847.679 --> 1852.88
there's a curse or something

1849.679 --> 1855.44
yeah that's an idea

1852.88 --> 1858.5590000000002
that is going to stick stick get into

1855.44 --> 1862.64
people's imagination it's like

1858.559 --> 1865.12
treasure city right so

1862.64 --> 1866.72
it would not have to ever exist if

1865.12 --> 1869.6
somebody just came up with it and

1866.72 --> 1870.3990000000001
decided to tell it as a rumor story to

1869.6 --> 1873.84
kind of like

1870.399 --> 1874.799
maneuver people to get away from their

1873.84 --> 1878.24
homes and

1874.799 --> 1881.36
and like start exploration then a city

1878.24 --> 1884.32
of gold in a mysterious land

1881.36 --> 1886.32
would have never have to even had a clue

1884.32 --> 1888.799
of existing

1886.32 --> 1889.6789999999999
it would still grab people and kind of

1888.799 --> 1892.08
echo on

1889.679 --> 1894.3200000000002
over the ages and somebody might draw

1892.08 --> 1895.12
his in visualization of what it would

1894.32 --> 1898.6399999999999
look like

1895.12 --> 1907.84
and that would enhance the aberration

1898.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
which it would be even further

1910.67 --> 1913.809
[Music]

1916.41 --> 1921.8400000000001
[Music]

1918.84 --> 1921.84
hmm

1934.08 --> 1937.6789999999999
oh see me traveler uh

1943.44 --> 1948.0800000000002
i guess it would be gold my favorite

1946.159 --> 1950.64
material to work with it's just that i

1948.08 --> 1952.399
haven't really worked with it a lot

1950.64 --> 1954.48
only sparingly because it's very

1952.399 --> 1956.1589999999999
expensive can't just like oh this gold

1954.48 --> 1958.08
thing that gold thing and i'm not gonna

1956.159 --> 1959.679
like build things with it and then melt

1958.08 --> 1962.0
it and try to remake it

1959.679 --> 1962.799
because every time you work on it or you

1962.0 --> 1965.36
melt it down

1962.799 --> 1967.2
there's a loss of material so it's kind

1965.36 --> 1971.039
of an expensive material to work with

1967.2 --> 1971.039
but every time i have worked with it

1972.88 --> 1979.7600000000002
it was always very interesting

1977.6 --> 1981.6789999999999
so i guess that gold would be the

1979.76 --> 1982.559
favorite material for me to work with

1981.679 --> 1984.48
but

1982.559 --> 1985.9189999999999
silver is also very good it's very

1984.48 --> 1989.039
different

1985.919 --> 2005.8400000000001
and i have worked a lot with silver most

1989.039 --> 2005.84
things that i made were silver

2006.96 --> 2015.2
but gold kind of makes it very

2010.96 --> 2015.2
easy to be really precise

2016.72 --> 2020.3990000000001
when you're crafting it when you're

2018.159 --> 2022.64
working with it it's really easy

2020.399 --> 2024.2399999999998
like when silver is much more like a

2022.64 --> 2025.8400000000001
whole project because

2024.24 --> 2027.679
if you have a silver object you're

2025.84 --> 2030.9599999999998
making and you try to

2027.679 --> 2032.799
weld something onto some spot of it

2030.96 --> 2034.64
every time you do that the whole thing

2032.799 --> 2037.6
has to be heated

2034.64 --> 2039.1200000000001
and then things can go wrong in that

2037.6 --> 2042.399
process

2039.12 --> 2044.1589999999999
with gold you can just stick on as many

2042.399 --> 2047.6
things as you like

2044.159 --> 2049.52
because the heat doesn't radiate out so

2047.6 --> 2051.44
every time it just gets locally heated

2049.52 --> 2053.359
if you do it right yeah you could just

2051.44 --> 2054.879
aim your flame wrong and then melt the

2053.359 --> 2057.7599999999998
entire freaking thing if you don't

2054.879 --> 2057.7599999999998
if you're not careful

2057.919 --> 2064.399
it's much easier to craft new

2061.28 --> 2066.8
parts onto a gold object than it is

2064.399 --> 2066.7999999999997
silver

2070.24 --> 2074.3199999999997
so with gold it's also easier to

2072.56 --> 2077.359
basically have

2074.32 --> 2081.3590000000004
tiny parts pre-constructed

2077.359 --> 2086.399
pre smoothened put them together

2081.359 --> 2088.72
and then make it into a hole with silver

2086.399 --> 2090.72
it's trickier because again the whole

2088.72 --> 2093.04
thing has to heat

2090.72 --> 2095.5989999999997
so if you have a lot of loose things

2093.04 --> 2098.72
that are all welded

2095.599 --> 2099.76
together with solder then yeah if you

2098.72 --> 2101.7599999999998
eat one part

2099.76 --> 2104.1600000000003
then something else might like oops it

2101.76 --> 2106.88
goes loose it's much more of a hassle

2104.16 --> 2106.8799999999997
than with gold

2113.52 --> 2119.7599999999998
i don't know what a set or a square is

2115.92 --> 2119.76
seeking star wars never heard of that

2123.68 --> 2134.64
what's that whoa

2130.8 --> 2136.88
that's incredible steamy traveler

2134.64 --> 2139.839
right but yeah this what you're seeing

2136.88 --> 2139.839
there that picture

2140.8 --> 2149.92
it yeah that is possible with gold

2145.68 --> 2152.48
again because if you know how to

2149.92 --> 2153.119
locally heat it and not because this

2152.48 --> 2155.359
thing

2153.119 --> 2156.48
one big flame onto it and the whole

2155.359 --> 2159.359
thing melts

2156.48 --> 2161.04
right as long as you can work with small

2159.359 --> 2164.48
local heating

2161.04 --> 2166.96
somehow then yeah you can just

2164.48 --> 2167.52
stick on piece by piece by piece and

2166.96 --> 2169.68
then

2167.52 --> 2170.72
stick that on another bigger piece and

2169.68 --> 2174.16
then you get like

2170.72 --> 2176.0
super elaborate complicated objects like

2174.16 --> 2179.04
this

2176.0 --> 2180.64
that's very that's much easier

2179.04 --> 2182.079
to do with gold than with any other

2180.64 --> 2185.52
material like

2182.079 --> 2188.6400000000003
because this thing is not cast

2185.52 --> 2188.64
this is assembled

2193.76 --> 2197.119
hho torch

2199.599 --> 2203.2000000000003
right hydrogen oxygen

2203.599 --> 2210.1600000000003
well i typically use

2206.88 --> 2214.079
uh was it i think

2210.16 --> 2218.16
butane like one of the typical gas

2214.079 --> 2221.28
and oxygen like combine it

2218.16 --> 2223.2
that works really well with gold or with

2221.28 --> 2224.079
anything else pretty much but with gold

2223.2 --> 2226.48
because you can

2224.079 --> 2229.6800000000003
keep this the flame very small very

2226.48 --> 2233.2
local and still get it really hot

2229.68 --> 2233.5989999999997
if you add oxygen to it you really need

2233.2 --> 2235.359
to

2233.599 --> 2237.599
like any kind of soldering and

2235.359 --> 2243.2799999999997
goldsmithing without

2237.599 --> 2244.6400000000003
having oxygen added to it

2243.28 --> 2246.6400000000003
you know there are systems where you

2244.64 --> 2249.5989999999997
literally

2246.64 --> 2250.8799999999997
because of the the nozzle it sucks in

2249.599 --> 2254.0
the air

2250.88 --> 2254.56
like in because of the mechanism and

2254.0 --> 2257.119
then

2254.56 --> 2258.4
that way you can heating the flame

2257.119 --> 2261.599
beyond just the typical

2258.4 --> 2262.64
yellow burning because you really need

2261.599 --> 2265.44
that

2262.64 --> 2266.72
but if you add oxygen directly from a

2265.44 --> 2269.92
separate tank

2266.72 --> 2271.2799999999997
to the flame it yeah it gets much better

2269.92 --> 2273.839
and then you can keep the sm

2271.28 --> 2274.4
the flames really small like really

2273.839 --> 2278.0789999999997
small

2274.4 --> 2278.079
it literally can come out of

2278.96 --> 2285.92
like out of a pin just a very

2282.8 --> 2286.4
very thin pin would be like at the end

2285.92 --> 2288.16
and

2286.4 --> 2289.44
the flame would come out of that would

2288.16 --> 2294.24
be this big and

2289.44 --> 2294.2400000000002
super hot very effective

2294.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
it's been a while since i worked on any

2296.64 --> 2299.839
of that

2300.88 --> 2313.839
pick of the necklace

2303.92 --> 2313.839
okay so you can start water sure

2339.839 --> 2344.32
what iron if he is there gold in your

2343.04 --> 2347.44
area that can

2344.32 --> 2350.079
being kept after being found what does

2347.44 --> 2350.079
that even mean

2351.599 --> 2357.3590000000004
there's no gold in the ground here in

2354.32 --> 2357.3590000000004
the netherlands at all

2361.68 --> 2369.839
uh yeah terra 306 i guess

2365.28 --> 2369.8390000000004
hello welcome to the stream

2375.839 --> 2381.359
well iron fe if you find gold it's going

2379.04 --> 2385.2
to be something that's been lost

2381.359 --> 2385.2
yeah of course you can keep that

2385.76 --> 2388.7200000000003
finders keepers

2390.32 --> 2396.079
unless it's like a like a suitcase full

2393.839 --> 2398.64
of gold bars or something and then

2396.079 --> 2398.6400000000003
yeah then

2400.16 --> 2413.7599999999998
it's not as easy

2410.96 --> 2416.48
natural golden no no there is no gold in

2413.76 --> 2416.48
the ground here

2418.319 --> 2421.7599999999998
there might have been places where there

2419.92 --> 2424.8
was a little

2421.76 --> 2426.48
but that's all been mined

2424.8 --> 2428.96
and i don't think the netherlands ever

2426.48 --> 2428.96
had any

2433.52 --> 2439.839
and there's not any in the rivers either

2441.92 --> 2447.04
whatever gold used to be in the ground

2444.48 --> 2450.88
here it's all been mined

2447.04 --> 2454.0
now of course you can still filter out

2450.88 --> 2457.359
the gold because there's like an average

2454.0 --> 2460.56
micro percentage of gold pretty much

2457.359 --> 2464.64
in everything right but it's not

2460.56 --> 2467.839
efficient like scooping up

2464.64 --> 2467.839
100 cubes

2467.92 --> 2474.96
100 cubic meters so to to get

2471.44 --> 2476.7200000000003
like one micro grain of gold it's not

2474.96 --> 2481.839
worth it

2476.72 --> 2481.839
it's too much work for too little gold

2492.839 --> 2497.7599999999998
hmm yeah

2495.359 --> 2499.2
steamy traveler that that that looks

2497.76 --> 2503.8390000000004
very similar

2499.2 --> 2506.839
yeah that's pretty much

2503.839 --> 2509.839
the same design as the device that i

2506.839 --> 2509.839
used

2526.63 --> 2529.6690000000003
[Music]

2533.28 --> 2537.8390000000004
okay taryn what is that link

2541.599 --> 2551.839
ooh sun dog

2552.88 --> 2557.04
yeah i've seen a few sun dogs myself

2557.359 --> 2562.319
but they only really start to stand out

2559.44 --> 2566.0
when with cameras though

2562.319 --> 2569.359
i have seen like fake traces of

2566.0 --> 2573.119
it of something like this

2569.359 --> 2573.119
you link to with my eyes

2573.52 --> 2593.839
but it would not be as pronounced as

2576.4 --> 2593.839
like when you look at it with a camera

2604.839 --> 2607.839
hmm

2618.839 --> 2621.839
so

2632.88 --> 2635.839
hmm

2648.48 --> 2654.56
it's a halo not a sun dog oh it kind of

2651.44 --> 2654.56
looks like a rainbow

2658.48 --> 2662.0
so i do wonder like how is that like how

2661.599 --> 2664.4
is that

2662.0 --> 2664.4
happening

2671.2 --> 2674.72
it is kind of mysterious maybe i could

2673.76 --> 2678.5600000000004
just really

2674.72 --> 2681.4399999999996
loosely speculate maybe it's because

2678.56 --> 2684.319
at times when that's happening there is

2681.44 --> 2686.7200000000003
like particles or even moist

2684.319 --> 2688.079
very high up in the air like unusual

2686.72 --> 2690.0789999999997
heights

2688.079 --> 2692.2400000000002
so that there would be kind of moist at

2690.079 --> 2694.079
the effective edge of vision where the

2692.24 --> 2697.2799999999997
sun

2694.079 --> 2699.3590000000004
will seem to be manifesting as a

2697.28 --> 2701.76
holographic phenomenon

2699.359 --> 2704.0789999999997
and that big yeah that it kind of like

2701.76 --> 2706.2400000000002
would manifest

2704.079 --> 2707.44
right in the middle of the moist

2706.24 --> 2709.9199999999996
virtually

2707.44 --> 2712.0
causing that rainbow effect maybe it's

2709.92 --> 2713.599
something like that

2712.0 --> 2715.68
most of the time it doesn't seem to

2713.599 --> 2718.48
happen and that's then

2715.68 --> 2720.56
again pure speculation that it is

2718.48 --> 2722.2400000000002
because there's not that much moist

2720.56 --> 2724.48
right at the edge of vision where the

2722.24 --> 2727.5989999999997
holographic phenomenon of the sun will

2724.48 --> 2727.599
seem to manifest

2727.68 --> 2733.839
as an origin point but it's only

2730.64 --> 2733.839
apparent of course

2739.04 --> 2742.4
it looks that way when your sun gets i

2741.119 --> 2746.96
disagree and

2742.4 --> 2750.0
i i don't do that by the way

2746.96 --> 2750.56
just don't don't look with open eyes in

2750.0 --> 2754.24
the sun

2750.56 --> 2757.119
i recommend against it it's not really

2754.24 --> 2757.1189999999997
healthy for you

2757.599 --> 2762.6400000000003
look at it with the eyes closed that's

2759.92 --> 2762.64
much better

2762.88 --> 2766.2400000000002
right because the real effect comes from

2765.359 --> 2770.4
the sun

2766.24 --> 2774.72
going through you through the holes

2770.4 --> 2777.839
of your skull entering pineal gland

2774.72 --> 2779.2
that's the real effect of sun gazing

2777.839 --> 2782.16
it's not like oh

2779.2 --> 2784.8799999999997
burn out your redness no because that

2782.16 --> 2784.8799999999997
can happen

2786.4 --> 2790.8
yeah actually it's very healthy well

2788.24 --> 2793.9199999999996
good luck with that

2790.8 --> 2799.119
i i like to keep my eyes

2793.92 --> 2799.119
like pristine if possible as long as i

2800.839 --> 2803.839
can

2805.599 --> 2811.52
any suggestion to get into something in

2808.96 --> 2811.52
the arts

2815.76 --> 2818.079
what

2824.88 --> 2828.48
i don't know see me traveler

2829.599 --> 2837.28
i mean people can get into art

2833.599 --> 2838.6400000000003
but usually when yeah when there's a

2837.28 --> 2840.8
real artist there

2838.64 --> 2843.1189999999997
the art gets into them not the other way

2840.8 --> 2843.119
around

2843.359 --> 2847.04
if you really got it in you you don't

2844.88 --> 2849.6800000000003
have to really try it out

2847.04 --> 2851.119
it'll come calling you will be drawn to

2849.68 --> 2853.2
it and then do it

2851.119 --> 2855.44
even before you consciously know what it

2853.2 --> 2855.4399999999996
is

2856.319 --> 2861.359
i had that with design drawings i i

2859.52 --> 2862.88
tried painting later because it was

2861.359 --> 2865.2
suggested to me

2862.88 --> 2867.92
and then it just didn't really work out

2865.2 --> 2870.96
it didn't develop

2867.92 --> 2872.079
because it's just not my thing right so

2870.96 --> 2875.28
yeah you can get

2872.079 --> 2878.319
into painting but unless

2875.28 --> 2880.2400000000002
you're like have a natural talent for

2878.319 --> 2883.68
everything that comes with it

2880.24 --> 2885.52
then yeah you can still do it

2883.68 --> 2889.04
like a hobby thing but it's never going

2885.52 --> 2889.04
to be extraordinary

2891.359 --> 2893.5989999999997
right

2895.04 --> 2902.0
so i don't know but

2900.24 --> 2904.0
yeah technically you could go with

2902.0 --> 2907.28
anything

2904.0 --> 2907.28
you could go into like

2908.8 --> 2914.88
living plant architecture i'd say that's

2912.319 --> 2917.7599999999998
an art like

2914.88 --> 2918.7200000000003
very elven like yeah you can literally

2917.76 --> 2922.3190000000004
just bend

2918.72 --> 2925.9199999999996
trees and like if you then

2922.319 --> 2928.24
map out how you predict the trees will

2925.92 --> 2930.88
grow over time you can literally like

2928.24 --> 2930.8799999999997
use them

2931.44 --> 2936.559
to become like part of a construction or

2934.24 --> 2942.0
a building

2936.559 --> 2944.88
right i think that's art

2942.0 --> 2946.64
but it does take time though a lot of

2944.88 --> 2949.359
time

2946.64 --> 2949.92
but you can literally like shape trees

2949.359 --> 2953.119
to

2949.92 --> 2953.6800000000003
become very specific shape and then kind

2953.119 --> 2956.2400000000002
of like

2953.68 --> 2957.7599999999998
use them as a foundation for some

2956.24 --> 2960.16
structure

2957.76 --> 2960.1600000000003
living

2964.0 --> 2968.0
watch bob ross and you will be able to

2966.0 --> 2971.119
paint well paint

2968.0 --> 2974.16
like landscape pictures tom parker

2971.119 --> 2975.6800000000003
like he's a landscaper right

2974.16 --> 2978.3999999999996
it's more to painting than just

2975.68 --> 2978.3999999999996
landscaping

2979.599 --> 2984.079
like yeah i i've drawn landscapes

2982.4 --> 2986.88
landscapes are

2984.079 --> 2986.88
pretty doable

2994.72 --> 3013.839
thanks bob three or six

3024.839 --> 3027.839
hmm

3044.72 --> 3050.7999999999997
right but to continue

3048.559 --> 3052.48
your question steamy traveler were you

3050.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
looking for art

3052.48 --> 3056.4
well how about speech art how about the

3055.839 --> 3059.599
arts

3056.4 --> 3063.2000000000003
of language how about the art

3059.599 --> 3066.8
of using language

3063.2 --> 3069.7599999999998
to amplify consciousness

3066.8 --> 3070.559
you know spiritual arts this is like

3069.76 --> 3073.6800000000003
anything is

3070.559 --> 3073.6800000000003
effectively art

3079.839 --> 3087.119
like art just requires vision

3083.44 --> 3088.7200000000003
and passion that's pretty much it then

3087.119 --> 3097.839
it can art can be in

3088.72 --> 3097.839
any field

3104.319 --> 3109.119
yeah iron fe what look you can use arts

3106.96 --> 3112.0
for profit but when you do that then you

3109.119 --> 3112.0
kind of bind it

3113.68 --> 3121.1189999999997
right because if you're gonna make art

3118.079 --> 3123.04
while having money on your mind and then

3121.119 --> 3125.04
cross-referencing as you're producing

3123.04 --> 3125.7599999999998
with like the value that you could get

3125.04 --> 3129.599
of it

3125.76 --> 3131.76
then in that process whatever it is

3129.599 --> 3132.7200000000003
the inspiration the source that comes

3131.76 --> 3135.6800000000003
welling up

3132.72 --> 3137.4399999999996
to bring you all that clarity and the

3135.68 --> 3140.48
vision and the creativity

3137.44 --> 3144.319
it's gonna kind of plug it up

3140.48 --> 3147.599
right money plugs up the fountain of

3144.319 --> 3153.839
inspiration it does

3147.599 --> 3153.839
it does it every time

3155.52 --> 3160.24
it's like it's a serious problem for for

3158.48 --> 3163.92
successful artists

3160.24 --> 3163.9199999999996
is that the money seducer

3164.079 --> 3167.44
like lucifer effectively lucifer doesn't

3166.559 --> 3170.48
have to be

3167.44 --> 3173.44
totally evil but it like money will just

3170.48 --> 3175.76
cause you to bend your mind and

3173.44 --> 3180.319
consciousness focus to the money

3175.76 --> 3183.599
and then take away from the actual art

3180.319 --> 3185.599
it will become more like as a sales

3183.599 --> 3187.6800000000003
product

3185.599 --> 3188.8
than it will actual art right because

3187.68 --> 3191.839
actual art

3188.8 --> 3192.2400000000002
is quite the opposite it it tries to

3191.839 --> 3195.04
step

3192.24 --> 3196.0789999999997
outside of typical conventions and

3195.04 --> 3199.2
tricks

3196.079 --> 3201.44
and formulas it's

3199.2 --> 3204.48
new that's what makes it real art it's

3201.44 --> 3207.68
like unusual it's outside of the

3204.48 --> 3209.839
the norm whatever that may be at the

3207.68 --> 3209.839
time

3229.44 --> 3234.7200000000003
right sometimes art is just made for

3232.0 --> 3238.16
pure oppositional defiance

3234.72 --> 3241.839
just for that because yeah

3238.16 --> 3243.5989999999997
people that are artistically talented

3241.839 --> 3245.44
they might make anything but it's just

3243.599 --> 3247.44
like don't really care

3245.44 --> 3249.44
just too much pumping or something you

3247.44 --> 3251.839
know

3249.44 --> 3252.48
but then it's like oh yeah if somebody's

3251.839 --> 3254.48
gonna then

3252.48 --> 3258.319
start dictating top down or something

3254.48 --> 3260.64
like this is the only way it should be

3258.319 --> 3261.599
this is how you should do it then that

3260.64 --> 3265.839
might typically

3261.599 --> 3267.92
infuse a rebellious inspiration response

3265.839 --> 3269.599
where the person's gonna absolutely

3267.92 --> 3272.16
prove the other one wrong

3269.599 --> 3275.2000000000003
right then they'll start going from an

3272.16 --> 3277.839
oppositional defiant position

3275.2 --> 3278.72
oppositional defines can be quite the

3277.839 --> 3282.48
muse

3278.72 --> 3284.8799999999997
to an artist they will give it their

3282.48 --> 3285.839
all because they are rebelling against

3284.88 --> 3289.04
something that

3285.839 --> 3291.52
they feel is clamping down on them

3289.04 --> 3293.839
on their spirit and on their freedom

3291.52 --> 3293.839
right

3305.599 --> 3308.6400000000003
knitting

3307.0 --> 3311.359
[Music]

3308.64 --> 3314.5589999999997
oh hey i've seen you can make pretty

3311.359 --> 3316.4
amazing things with knitting

3314.559 --> 3318.799
there's some ladies out there that are

3316.4 --> 3321.2000000000003
like really good at it

3318.799 --> 3323.7599999999998
and that can just do incredible works at

3321.2 --> 3328.24
a very short time span

3323.76 --> 3328.2400000000002
i see that as an art definitely

3330.72 --> 3337.839
creating memes art for the masses

3334.16 --> 3340.16
oh yeah iron fe memes but the thing is

3337.839 --> 3340.16
again

3340.88 --> 3347.44
it's almost like memes

3344.72 --> 3348.16
are like a different category because

3347.44 --> 3350.799
memes are

3348.16 --> 3353.359
are already have like a designation as

3350.799 --> 3354.48
in that they must be catchy they must be

3353.359 --> 3357.2799999999997
of the time

3354.48 --> 3357.28
mindset so

3359.76 --> 3365.2000000000003
if you're like have an occupation

3362.96 --> 3367.44
specifically to create memes and not

3365.2 --> 3371.2
just let the memes happen

3367.44 --> 3374.079
then that might cause

3371.2 --> 3376.0789999999997
like real eroding and [ __ ] right because

3374.079 --> 3378.799
it has to catch so you can't

3376.079 --> 3380.1600000000003
make it to outside of the box for

3378.799 --> 3384.16
whatever

3380.16 --> 3386.48
designated group the memes have got to

3384.16 --> 3386.48
catch

3387.52 --> 3391.839
so yeah

3402.64 --> 3407.7599999999998
right if you have if you're just good at

3404.72 --> 3410.9599999999996
memes as a side effect

3407.76 --> 3412.88
as a format of doing your thing

3410.96 --> 3414.7200000000003
yeah they can be great they can be art

3412.88 --> 3417.52
but if you're really like oh

3414.72 --> 3418.0
we have to create memes then then

3417.52 --> 3422.16
usually

3418.0 --> 3424.96
the same thing happens as when an artist

3422.16 --> 3427.359
needs to sell needs to sell so it's

3424.96 --> 3430.7200000000003
going to adapt its creative processes to

3427.359 --> 3433.7599999999998
getting it sold also the same

3430.72 --> 3436.72
goes for professional meme makers

3433.76 --> 3439.0400000000004
it has to stick it has to fight right

3436.72 --> 3442.319
and then

3439.04 --> 3445.68
like real spontaneous realizations and

3442.319 --> 3446.0
unique psychological moments might elude

3445.68 --> 3450.0
them

3446.0 --> 3450.0
because of that it's the same effect

3458.839 --> 3461.839
right

3484.16 --> 3490.64
industrial artist art by contract right

3488.079 --> 3493.2000000000003
like the thing is it kind of undoes

3490.64 --> 3493.2
itself

3495.28 --> 3503.6800000000003
no more narrow the application

3499.2 --> 3508.16
of art forced by yourself

3503.68 --> 3517.839
the less artful it will become

3508.16 --> 3517.839
you usually end up in tropes

3526.4 --> 3531.839
more like drafting what

3539.599 --> 3544.1600000000003
memes are useful for breaking through

3541.28 --> 3546.1600000000003
indoctrination well yeah well

3544.16 --> 3550.16
specifically to break that

3546.16 --> 3550.16
memes are very easy

3550.319 --> 3557.2
because you can make very effective

3554.16 --> 3558.24
little straw man examples of a whole

3557.2 --> 3561.359
range of people

3558.24 --> 3563.2799999999997
that do these type of actions because of

3561.359 --> 3566.4
their indoctrination and then

3563.28 --> 3567.76
by showing that in a meme you can make

3566.4 --> 3571.2000000000003
that very upfront

3567.76 --> 3571.2000000000003
and still entertaining

3571.52 --> 3575.599
yeah so memes are very effective indeed

3573.839 --> 3587.839
to break through indoctrinations yes

3575.599 --> 3587.839
they are

3600.23 --> 3611.61
[Music]

3618.22 --> 3621.33
[Music]

3625.44 --> 3630.16
power have tried to restrict memes right

3627.68 --> 3630.16
but it's

3630.559 --> 3634.799
it's very difficult to restrict it

3638.24 --> 3645.839
like visuals visual memes are very

3643.2 --> 3648.16
difficult to truly restrict in a

3645.839 --> 3651.2799999999997
universal way because

3648.16 --> 3653.04
well powers that be also use it

3651.28 --> 3655.2000000000003
this is standard staple so if you're

3653.04 --> 3657.599
going to say oh this thing could not

3655.2 --> 3659.52
not be showed because of the mind

3657.599 --> 3661.92
control meme potential

3659.52 --> 3663.92
well that means that it's not gonna be

3661.92 --> 3668.559
usable by anything

3663.92 --> 3668.559
so every time like a government tries to

3669.839 --> 3673.2
erase a meme they usually cut in their

3672.88 --> 3676.4
own

3673.2 --> 3676.3999999999996
influences as well

3677.119 --> 3685.839
it's very tough to crack down on memes

3689.04 --> 3694.799
okay jesus died for you too i don't

3691.92 --> 3699.839
think jesus died by the way

3694.799 --> 3699.839
but everything else is pretty much true

3702.799 --> 3709.44
that's a bit of an oversimplification

3710.839 --> 3713.839
but

3726.64 --> 3729.2
okay

3733.839 --> 3737.839
it makes me feel i didn't die well i

3736.0 --> 3740.799
addressed that a few days ago when i had

3737.839 --> 3743.839
an entire show dedicated to it

3740.799 --> 3747.52
but what makes me feel he deny is well

3743.839 --> 3750.319
he's god right well

3747.52 --> 3752.4
if he's really god then he shouldn't be

3750.319 --> 3755.92
able to die

3752.4 --> 3758.96
and i think that he was like

3755.92 --> 3759.92
on the edge of it enough to convince the

3758.96 --> 3762.96
powers that

3759.92 --> 3766.64
be that he was dead

3762.96 --> 3768.64
in order to get away from that situation

3766.64 --> 3770.72
from growing worse

3768.64 --> 3772.64
so what i think is he basically sounds

3770.72 --> 3776.0789999999997
really bad don't mean it like that

3772.64 --> 3777.839
he faked his death in order to resolve

3776.079 --> 3780.7200000000003
the situation

3777.839 --> 3781.44
and actually regenerate it survived it

3780.72 --> 3784.48
which is an

3781.44 --> 3788.64
unbelievable feat

3784.48 --> 3792.2400000000002
for any humanoid i'd say

3788.64 --> 3796.0789999999997
right so i'm definitely not downplaying

3792.24 --> 3798.72
his power and god i'm just saying like

3796.079 --> 3800.0
what priests have made this thing of

3798.72 --> 3803.1189999999997
christ dying into

3800.0 --> 3804.319
is it feels like an abomination to me it

3803.119 --> 3806.799
feels like

3804.319 --> 3810.5589999999997
a mind control trick and it makes no

3806.799 --> 3811.44
sense there is no real logic to all of

3810.559 --> 3814.3190000000004
that

3811.44 --> 3815.359
it's based on the assumption that that

3814.319 --> 3818.5589999999997
sacrifice

3815.359 --> 3821.92
was ever condoned right

3818.559 --> 3824.559
that makes no sense like that

3821.92 --> 3825.44
pagan like slaughter sacrifice would be

3824.559 --> 3828.48
condoned

3825.44 --> 3830.7200000000003
at any point and i simply disagree to

3828.48 --> 3830.72
that

3832.079 --> 3836.079
and it makes it center it makes it

3834.24 --> 3839.5989999999997
center to like the entire

3836.079 --> 3842.48
godly cosmology i find that

3839.599 --> 3842.48
abominable

3842.88 --> 3850.0
i don't think any god would ever require

3846.4 --> 3852.7200000000003
that to happen to to what dispel

3850.0 --> 3854.88
sins that we are born with even though

3852.72 --> 3857.68
we're still

3854.88 --> 3859.92
it still comes they're still these sins

3857.68 --> 3862.0
they're in us that's part of our design

3859.92 --> 3864.799
right we're still gonna have to face

3862.0 --> 3866.0
them so why would you say that oh all

3864.799 --> 3867.52
your sins are

3866.0 --> 3869.28
it's all okay it's all taken away

3867.52 --> 3873.7599999999998
because this

3869.28 --> 3878.7200000000003
deity of a man was slaughtered for you

3873.76 --> 3878.7200000000003
i think that's an abomination to say

3878.839 --> 3882.799
that really i know it sounds quite

3881.2 --> 3884.96
dramatic when i put it like that but i

3882.799 --> 3884.96
do

3886.48 --> 3893.52
i don't think he died for our sins he

3889.839 --> 3896.72
lived to help us through

3893.52 --> 3897.28
to reveal things to us to show us the

3896.72 --> 3901.1189999999997
way

3897.28 --> 3904.48
his way and with promises

3901.119 --> 3908.48
we can ascend even further right

3904.48 --> 3911.599
he didn't die for our sins he lived

3908.48 --> 3914.48
as an example for us to deal

3911.599 --> 3914.48
with our sins

3915.599 --> 3922.6400000000003
where before there was no way through no

3918.24 --> 3924.8799999999997
way no example no way out that's what i

3922.64 --> 3924.8799999999997
think

3929.839 --> 3935.2
yeah that's really funny tiny bumble

3932.319 --> 3951.839
keep gaslighting yourself

3935.2 --> 3951.839
keep gaslighting yourself buddy

3954.799 --> 3958.72
well yeah well tom parker guess what

3957.359 --> 3962.64
wait just for sinner's death

3958.72 --> 3966.24
it still is yeah

3962.64 --> 3968.72
it's the design you can't take that

3966.24 --> 3968.72
away

3973.52 --> 3980.48
when you sin you die a little right

3978.48 --> 3982.4
if you don't find a way through if you

3980.48 --> 3985.44
don't

3982.4 --> 3988.079
give it an actual long-term function it

3985.44 --> 3989.76
is effectively a sin it is laying down

3988.079 --> 3993.92
cohesion

3989.76 --> 3995.3590000000004
that brings death closer it literally

3993.92 --> 3998.7200000000003
degenerates you

3995.359 --> 4001.44
it does sin degenerates you

3998.72 --> 4003.0389999999998
making you die a little that's not been

4001.44 --> 4006.799
taken away because christ

4003.039 --> 4009.76
died supposedly allegedly

4006.799 --> 4010.799
yeah that's just not true it's still

4009.76 --> 4014.3190000000004
there

4010.799 --> 4016.4
right now right now throughout your life

4014.319 --> 4017.599
if you do [ __ ] that's really bad for

4016.4 --> 4020.799
your spirit

4017.599 --> 4024.6400000000003
you're gonna grow old if you

4020.799 --> 4027.359
ignore the evils in the word world

4024.64 --> 4028.5589999999997
and let them attack you and scar you and

4027.359 --> 4032.24
you ignore it

4028.559 --> 4032.2400000000002
you grow old or sick

4033.2 --> 4037.7599999999998
it's still there right now

4038.0 --> 4041.599
dude if it wasn't for jesus christ and

4040.24 --> 4044.5589999999997
what he said

4041.599 --> 4048.96
then i would have probably not even been

4044.559 --> 4051.119
at the point where i could realize this

4048.96 --> 4052.4
right that's what he brought he brought

4051.119 --> 4055.6800000000003
the enlightenment

4052.4 --> 4059.039
this the vision the knowledge to see

4055.68 --> 4061.5989999999997
it for what it is and step away

4059.039 --> 4063.28
from tropes and oversimplification and

4061.599 --> 4077.839
cult behavior

4063.28 --> 4077.8390000000004
that's what he did

4079.28 --> 4084.3190000000004
oh god you too tiny wumbo i've been

4081.28 --> 4087.6800000000003
having that for like days

4084.319 --> 4087.68
freaking flashing [ __ ]

4089.119 --> 4105.839
i don't i can't even watch at the

4091.359 --> 4105.839
youtube page anymore

4130.839 --> 4135.6
uh

4132.48 --> 4147.839
right anyway uh

4135.6 --> 4147.839
be back in two minutes

4228.84 --> 4231.84
what

4252.239 --> 4258.799999999999
hmm well the flashing

4256.159 --> 4261.199
is not off my camera iron fv it's just

4258.8 --> 4263.76
the entire page

4261.199 --> 4264.639999999999
stalling showing a black screen and then

4263.76 --> 4266.96
back

4264.64 --> 4269.12
constantly that's that's the thing that

4266.96 --> 4273.36
i'm experiencing

4269.12 --> 4275.84
once again i'll show you

4273.36 --> 4278.639999999999
to see what that is see this this is

4275.84 --> 4287.84
what i was talking about

4278.64 --> 4287.84
that seems to keep happening

4293.76 --> 4301.84
but luckily in the recording that

4296.08 --> 4301.84
doesn't happen

4308.64 --> 4315.84
my image that's

4312.159 --> 4315.839999999999
that's just the lighting

4333.28 --> 4343.84
yeah by the way hello alexandra gonzalez

4336.32 --> 4343.84
slipped in there good to see you

4344.48 --> 4351.28
right so yeah i've got 20 20

4348.159 --> 4354.839999999999
minutes plus left so

4351.28 --> 4356.719
i think i pretty much explained

4354.84 --> 4358.96
everything

4356.719 --> 4360.56
but everything that was said so far so

4358.96 --> 4371.84
let's move

4360.56 --> 4371.84
bring it on

4372.88 --> 4375.92
like you can try to refute something i

4375.52 --> 4377.6
said

4375.92 --> 4381.36
ballers try it all the time well if you

4377.6 --> 4381.360000000001
want to refute something i've said

4381.52 --> 4385.84
concerning jesus's life

4388.32 --> 4393.12
let's argue it and then i'm gonna trace

4390.96 --> 4395.52
the origins of your statements

4393.12 --> 4396.48
and see if you actually understand what

4395.52 --> 4399.84
you're saying

4396.48 --> 4403.5199999999995
or are you just parroting priesthood

4399.84 --> 4403.52
chants right

4403.679 --> 4413.04
because that's my thing now i'm going to

4406.719 --> 4415.679
address that

4413.04 --> 4415.679
oh [ __ ]

4416.239 --> 4421.44
accidentally moved picture damn it

4424.84 --> 4427.84
uh

4433.6 --> 4436.96
i know how to fix that now

4437.92 --> 4443.4400000000005
copy transform paste transform and it's

4452.84 --> 4455.84
fixed

4471.84 --> 4475.92
outside of the bible how do we know

4473.44 --> 4478.799999999999
jesus even existed

4475.92 --> 4480.32
well there's a lot of historical

4478.8 --> 4484.2390000000005
evidence for that

4480.32 --> 4484.239
it's like surprising amount

4484.56 --> 4489.92
right that there definitely was this guy

4490.159 --> 4493.759999999999
and it gets a little warped a little

4492.8 --> 4498.4800000000005
weird because

4493.76 --> 4502.159000000001
i think that he went to india eventually

4498.48 --> 4505.5199999999995
then oh let bring in the

4502.159 --> 4508.719
the churchians say oh no no no

4505.52 --> 4514.159000000001
of course not because he died right well

4508.719 --> 4514.159
if he didn't die then why not

4517.04 --> 4524.0
and hey i've even argued who gives a

4520.64 --> 4527.04
[ __ ] who gives a [ __ ]

4524.0 --> 4528.48
tiny wombo whether he existed or not

4527.04 --> 4531.04
why don't you just listen to the

4528.48 --> 4533.04
freaking words that he says

4531.04 --> 4534.48
at the actions described and the

4533.04 --> 4538.159
motivations and

4534.48 --> 4542.5599999999995
the reasons yeah

4538.159 --> 4545.679
i don't care if he ever existed

4542.56 --> 4548.88
those words those actions

4545.679 --> 4552.2390000000005
that spirit i don't care

4548.88 --> 4554.88
if it if it was made up if god

4552.239 --> 4556.32
literally just beamed that idea into

4554.88 --> 4558.2390000000005
people's heads

4556.32 --> 4559.599999999999
whether it was actually a person that

4558.239 --> 4562.879999999999
did that

4559.6 --> 4565.120000000001
it is magnificent and it must not be

4562.88 --> 4568.0
forgotten

4565.12 --> 4570.0
because those words whether it came from

4568.0 --> 4573.76
a real person or not

4570.0 --> 4577.84
are absolutely tools that help

4573.76 --> 4581.4400000000005
people as a guide right tiny womble

4577.84 --> 4582.32
so it doesn't matter whether jesus

4581.44 --> 4587.04
existed

4582.32 --> 4595.84
or not the words are what they are

4587.04 --> 4595.84
yeah it doesn't matter

4598.88 --> 4603.36
holy [ __ ] really it's dimitra south

4601.199 --> 4609.839999999999
america

4603.36 --> 4609.839999999999
what are you sure about that

4610.239 --> 4614.4
that's never caught up on that

4615.76 --> 4620.159000000001
oh i don't agree with me well i don't

4618.48 --> 4622.639999999999
give a [ __ ] you do

4620.159 --> 4624.639999999999
or you don't tiny wombo because

4622.64 --> 4628.64
everything i said stands and i don't

4624.64 --> 4628.64
care if 99

4629.08 --> 4634.0
99.99 of all humanity

4631.44 --> 4635.12
or if i'm literally the only [ __ ] one

4634.0 --> 4638.32
in the world

4635.12 --> 4638.8
that believes it like i don't care i

4638.32 --> 4642.239
don't

4638.8 --> 4645.4400000000005
care yeah

4642.239 --> 4651.839999999999
my arguments stand

4645.44 --> 4651.839999999999
and there's nothing you can do about it

4659.18 --> 4663.329000000001
[Music]

4664.08 --> 4670.64
oh okay fine sure whatever

4668.0 --> 4672.159
whatever tiny wumble find it quite

4670.64 --> 4675.52
annoying that you'd even

4672.159 --> 4676.639999999999
bring that up because i do think he

4675.52 --> 4679.1990000000005
existed

4676.64 --> 4681.679
is one of the more well registered

4679.199 --> 4684.799999999999
individuals of the past

4681.679 --> 4688.08
yeah i do think he existed my point is

4684.8 --> 4690.0
it doesn't matter whether he exists it

4688.08 --> 4691.04
doesn't matter whether the whole thing

4690.0 --> 4695.52
is fiction

4691.04 --> 4700.0
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

4695.52 --> 4700.0
matters is power of the words

4701.12 --> 4704.48
power of the actions the thought behind

4703.92 --> 4707.84
it

4704.48 --> 4707.839999999999
it is immortal

4709.12 --> 4714.96
doesn't matter if it's fiction

4712.159 --> 4716.32
it is immortal doesn't matter if it

4714.96 --> 4719.28
actually was

4716.32 --> 4720.32
grafted onto this character and it came

4719.28 --> 4723.5199999999995
from someone

4720.32 --> 4725.5199999999995
else from i don't know another like

4723.52 --> 4727.679
godly incarnation that came down to

4725.52 --> 4730.0
earth to do something and he said that

4727.679 --> 4730.56
and then it was grafted onto the jesus

4730.0 --> 4734.32
character

4730.56 --> 4735.4400000000005
it doesn't matter it only matters is the

4734.32 --> 4738.32
words

4735.44 --> 4739.678999999999
and the spirit behind the words and the

4738.32 --> 4742.719
spirit behind

4739.679 --> 4745.4400000000005
the context that

4742.719 --> 4746.8
is a map it's a map for the spirit is an

4745.44 --> 4750.08
example

4746.8 --> 4751.76
it's a road an optimization and it

4750.08 --> 4763.679
doesn't matter where it came from the

4751.76 --> 4766.56
only thing that matters is what it is

4763.679 --> 4767.4400000000005
it's fine tiny wumbo i just get annoyed

4766.56 --> 4770.56
anytime

4767.44 --> 4771.5199999999995
anybody says like ooh he might not have

4770.56 --> 4774.4800000000005
existed

4771.52 --> 4775.4400000000005
that's just my immediate response to go

4774.48 --> 4777.44
[ __ ] yourself

4775.44 --> 4780.879999999999
okay that's my immediate response every

4777.44 --> 4780.879999999999
time i hear somebody do that

4780.96 --> 4785.199
right literally because

4786.4 --> 4791.44
yeah i just i i can't stand it when

4789.12 --> 4793.04
people do that

4791.44 --> 4794.799999999999
i can't stand people that would

4793.04 --> 4797.5199999999995
literally deny

4794.8 --> 4799.679
his existence to try and take away the

4797.52 --> 4801.679
power of those words

4799.679 --> 4803.679
because that's what people do that for

4801.679 --> 4806.159
they deny his existence because they

4803.679 --> 4810.0
want to deny the power

4806.159 --> 4811.839999999999
that is brought with it power for

4810.0 --> 4814.56
humanity for the individual for

4811.84 --> 4814.56
ascension

4815.44 --> 4819.839999999999
the way through

4831.04 --> 4837.12
yeah andrew well who knows man maybe

4834.4 --> 4839.44
people maybe they will start to spread

4837.12 --> 4843.12
rumors that i'm actually holographic

4839.44 --> 4847.919999999999
right i'm just this cgi

4843.12 --> 4847.92
project i'm like the a.i

4849.04 --> 4856.96
christ's simulator or whatever

4853.679 --> 4860.96
i am the arwin wizard project i am

4856.96 --> 4864.4800000000005
cgi i never existed

4860.96 --> 4864.4800000000005
just like patricia's dear

4866.96 --> 4870.159
yeah doesn't really matter though you

4869.679 --> 4873.12
know

4870.159 --> 4874.0
the power of the words the realization

4873.12 --> 4876.48
that happens

4874.0 --> 4877.76
when you listen that is what really

4876.48 --> 4881.599999999999
matters

4877.76 --> 4884.8
so in the end i've already set

4881.6 --> 4887.6
set my spirit to yes like yes

4884.8 --> 4888.08
i matter as a person as an individual

4887.6 --> 4892.56
very

4888.08 --> 4896.32
little very little because when i die

4892.56 --> 4899.76
nobody cares nobody should care

4896.32 --> 4902.88
right but if my words

4899.76 --> 4905.12
do something good then my words should

4902.88 --> 4908.32
carry on that's what i've always wanted

4905.12 --> 4910.0
in that sense i am memeing

4908.32 --> 4912.4
and in a way you could consider that

4910.0 --> 4915.84
christ's words are meaning

4912.4 --> 4918.4
they meme an entire spirit and

4915.84 --> 4919.12
it's meant not to be like oh i'm jesus

4918.4 --> 4922.159
christ i'm

4919.12 --> 4925.599999999999
special i am the gods designated

4922.159 --> 4928.32
i am so important no

4925.6 --> 4928.84
it's the words and the message and that

4928.32 --> 4932.4
he

4928.84 --> 4933.76
wanted to make it echo for others to

4932.4 --> 4936.5599999999995
catch it too

4933.76 --> 4938.96
get spiritually enlightened by it and

4936.56 --> 4941.1990000000005
carry on doing the same

4938.96 --> 4943.76
that was the whole point and in that

4941.199 --> 4948.4
sense i tried to follow it

4943.76 --> 4951.6
to do the same because i i don't matter

4948.4 --> 4954.5599999999995
i really don't i'm just this guy

4951.6 --> 4956.56
can barely societally integrate it oh

4954.56 --> 4960.400000000001
yeah i'm very smart

4956.56 --> 4962.4800000000005
but i have issues and i've just got a

4960.4 --> 4965.599999999999
bunch of words and ideas and that's

4962.48 --> 4968.159
it i barely even

4965.6 --> 4970.56
i don't even have a real social life not

4968.159 --> 4970.5599999999995
really

4970.84 --> 4978.56
right are we nature destroyer of globes

4975.28 --> 4981.759999999999
well not even that i'm actually also

4978.56 --> 4983.92
continuing the globe religion in the

4981.76 --> 4986.639
moment of its death

4983.92 --> 4988.719
because it is dying you can see it

4986.639 --> 4989.52
they're all just muttering spiraling

4988.719 --> 4993.36
into

4989.52 --> 4996.400000000001
just death right and i'm actually

4993.36 --> 4999.759999999999
continuing the dream

4996.4 --> 5002.879999999999
in a productive fashion so that

4999.76 --> 5006.639
what i always saw in the globe a

5002.88 --> 5010.719
a great tool to play with to make us

5006.639 --> 5014.8
think i'm trying to retain that

5010.719 --> 5018.08
for humanity to prevent that it'll just

5014.8 --> 5019.84
be polarized and and just hate but

5018.08 --> 5022.48
really just like hey

5019.84 --> 5023.12
what if the earth was a globe we know it

5022.48 --> 5026.239
isn't

5023.12 --> 5029.28
but what if how would things be

5026.239 --> 5031.199
consider this consider that consider

5029.28 --> 5033.44
everything you learned about physics

5031.199 --> 5036.719
right that's a creative

5033.44 --> 5039.678999999999
mental process that is what the globe is

5036.719 --> 5041.76
ideal for because it is so incredibly

5039.679 --> 5042.2390000000005
flawed it's literally like a test so

5041.76 --> 5044.4800000000005
like

5042.239 --> 5046.638999999999
okay you think you're good at physics

5044.48 --> 5049.678999999999
well let's presuppose the globe

5046.639 --> 5052.8
find the flaws well you go this

5049.679 --> 5056.4
this area that flaw that area that flaw

5052.8 --> 5058.88
right we i nathan oakley's crew

5056.4 --> 5059.839999999999
know this now because we're so trained

5058.88 --> 5062.96
at it

5059.84 --> 5067.52
but it is kind of like a test

5062.96 --> 5067.52
or it can be it can be that test

5067.6 --> 5073.92
right that's every time somebody says oh

5070.719 --> 5077.199
the globe needs to be removed

5073.92 --> 5079.12
from the consciousness then i say what

5077.199 --> 5081.44
why would you do that why would you take

5079.12 --> 5084.0
away that magnificent tool

5081.44 --> 5086.638999999999
to test your intellect with why would

5084.0 --> 5086.639
you do that

5087.84 --> 5094.88
right now of course like the approach

5091.84 --> 5096.719
the teaching of it like in schools then

5094.88 --> 5098.8
sure there should be some probably some

5096.719 --> 5102.88
altercations to that

5098.8 --> 5106.96
to not make it as indoctrinated

5102.88 --> 5110.84
it should be carefully considered

5106.96 --> 5112.08
and how to introduce it into people's

5110.84 --> 5114.2390000000005
lives

5112.08 --> 5115.92
instead of just using it as a weapon of

5114.239 --> 5117.5199999999995
mind control which it is kind of being

5115.92 --> 5120.4800000000005
used for now

5117.52 --> 5121.76
right but that doesn't make it a mind

5120.48 --> 5125.36
control weapon

5121.76 --> 5127.52
in origin i think it was a priestly tool

5125.36 --> 5129.5199999999995
as i even said way before like i think

5127.52 --> 5130.96
the globe was a mind experiment at a

5129.52 --> 5135.84
very early stage

5130.96 --> 5135.84
to test the new

5136.639 --> 5140.08
priest initiates whatever ancient

5139.04 --> 5142.48
priesthood very

5140.08 --> 5143.6
ancient times because it's all about

5142.48 --> 5145.839999999999
consciousness

5143.6 --> 5148.2390000000005
testing your knowledge right i thought

5145.84 --> 5152.639
it the globe was always meant for that

5148.239 --> 5155.04
and then it became a mind control weapon

5152.639 --> 5157.4400000000005
and that's how it's used now it's such a

5155.04 --> 5157.44
waste

5157.84 --> 5162.88
and at the meantime here the flat

5160.08 --> 5165.76
earthers that really get it

5162.88 --> 5166.32
isn't it awesome we we deal with the

5165.76 --> 5168.320000000001
globe

5166.32 --> 5170.799999999999
we deal with that puzzle on a daily

5168.32 --> 5171.12
basis and it's very entertaining and

5170.8 --> 5173.76
it's

5171.12 --> 5175.44
interesting it makes you think right

5173.76 --> 5180.84
well maybe that's because

5175.44 --> 5184.239
that's what it was designed for

5180.84 --> 5184.2390000000005
originally right

5188.08 --> 5191.44
ah hello julio pebbin

5192.48 --> 5197.678999999999
renovating your kitchen tons of money

5194.88 --> 5200.719
yeah that's that's fine julio pepin dude

5197.679 --> 5202.88
just do what you need to do i i'm doing

5200.719 --> 5206.08
fine right now financially i could still

5202.88 --> 5206.08
use support of course

5207.44 --> 5213.839999999999
but yeah you know your own life comes

5211.04 --> 5213.84
first of course

5215.36 --> 5220.159
and a good kitchen is a is a great

5218.08 --> 5225.679
blessing to have so

5220.159 --> 5227.28
hope that all turns out all right

5225.679 --> 5230.2390000000005
yeah hello by the way enemy can an

5227.28 --> 5230.239
apparent arwyn

5234.4 --> 5239.839999999999
and slo-mo moon buggy good to see you

5244.92 --> 5248.209
[Music]

5254.33 --> 5258.199
[Music]

5267.84 --> 5272.0
flat earth was always meant to be a

5269.36 --> 5272.0
treasure hunt

5272.159 --> 5277.599999999999
probably the depends on exactly what you

5275.92 --> 5279.36
mean if you mean like the flat earth

5277.6 --> 5282.8
movement

5279.36 --> 5285.599999999999
the 2015 awakening yeah

5282.8 --> 5286.08
probably it is kind of like a treasure

5285.6 --> 5287.84
hunt

5286.08 --> 5291.6
like oh what are they hiding what is it

5287.84 --> 5291.6
being hidden ooh antarctica

5291.84 --> 5295.360000000001
secret documents ooh secret ancient

5294.32 --> 5297.44
history yeah

5295.36 --> 5301.5199999999995
treasure hunt definitely is is kind of

5297.44 --> 5301.5199999999995
the spirit that makes it appealing

5302.239 --> 5307.04
am i a good cook i like to think so

5304.239 --> 5309.759999999999
steamy traveler

5307.04 --> 5310.08
favorite recipes i got several i like

5309.76 --> 5314.159000000001
make

5310.08 --> 5315.92
spaghetti and make it vegetarian these

5314.159 --> 5319.839999999999
days

5315.92 --> 5323.52
chili i had that the last week

5319.84 --> 5326.08
or last weekend also vegetarian make it

5323.52 --> 5326.080000000001
these days

5332.32 --> 5336.0
yeah chicken ketchup it's like

5334.56 --> 5339.120000000001
indonesian with a lot

5336.0 --> 5340.4
of ginger the ginger in every form and

5339.12 --> 5342.8
chicken

5340.4 --> 5344.799999999999
a bunch of garlic it's really nice and

5342.8 --> 5348.639
then have that with rice

5344.8 --> 5352.639
maybe some chili beans

5348.639 --> 5357.12
like chili and in beans together

5352.639 --> 5359.36
on top of that it's very uh oriental

5357.12 --> 5360.5599999999995
like i'm very proud of that recipe i

5359.36 --> 5363.5199999999995
really made

5360.56 --> 5365.1990000000005
specialized myself that is really tasty

5363.52 --> 5366.96
but it is a lot of work and it is kind

5365.199 --> 5370.96
of expensive to make

5366.96 --> 5374.159
because i make it all organic uh

5370.96 --> 5375.92
right what else yeah spaghetti can also

5374.159 --> 5380.5599999999995
be used to make lasagna

5375.92 --> 5385.36
so very nice but yeah cheese uh

5380.56 --> 5387.120000000001
what else yeah that

5385.36 --> 5388.719
i know there's all kinds of things i

5387.12 --> 5392.88
make and making pretty good

5388.719 --> 5394.96
vegetable soup

5392.88 --> 5397.12
but most of the time i really end up

5394.96 --> 5402.719
kind of like making hamburgers

5397.12 --> 5402.719
all organic with fresh vegetables too

5404.84 --> 5411.92
and yeah chicken broccoli

5407.6 --> 5411.92
one of my latest inventions

5415.76 --> 5425.360000000001
so yeah you're making me hungry now

5420.719 --> 5427.52
but yes i am a good cook like i am good

5425.36 --> 5428.4
i like to sit i like to think that my

5427.52 --> 5432.84
cooking

5428.4 --> 5435.839999999999
is on level with my communication

5432.84 --> 5435.84
quality

5439.76 --> 5443.360000000001
and i think i inherited that from my dad

5442.4 --> 5446.32
because my dad

5443.36 --> 5448.239
always used to be the cook in the house

5446.32 --> 5451.199
in my family

5448.239 --> 5453.839999999999
and he was pretty good like much better

5451.199 --> 5456.4
than my mom

5453.84 --> 5458.08
and yeah the same setup was with me and

5456.4 --> 5462.4
my ex i was the cook

5458.08 --> 5466.719
and yeah i would absolutely please her

5462.4 --> 5466.719
with that among other things

5470.08 --> 5473.44
on the level with gordon ramsay though

5472.719 --> 5476.159
no

5473.44 --> 5477.36
no it isn't it's not that kind of

5476.159 --> 5480.4
cooking

5477.36 --> 5482.799999999999
like i'm not a a cre a crea cook

5480.4 --> 5484.638999999999
like oh i can just make anything quickly

5482.8 --> 5488.320000000001
oh just the perfect

5484.639 --> 5488.32
the because that's like

5489.76 --> 5494.56
it's a different type of cooking it's

5497.6 --> 5502.0
it's more mechanized it gets more

5500.4 --> 5504.638999999999
professional but i don't

5502.0 --> 5506.48
really necessarily like that i mean that

5504.639 --> 5509.679
sort of cooking can be really good and

5506.48 --> 5512.799999999999
also yeah the thing about it is

5509.679 --> 5513.28
they can do so much so many different

5512.8 --> 5515.679
things

5513.28 --> 5517.36
right that's really what gordon ramsay

5515.679 --> 5518.56
cooking is all about is like you could

5517.36 --> 5522.08
make anything

5518.56 --> 5525.1990000000005
right i'm i can't make anything

5522.08 --> 5527.12
but i can make quite a few things

5525.199 --> 5528.4
that i've become really good at because

5527.12 --> 5530.8
i'm like

5528.4 --> 5532.0
i make it i think like hmm what's wrong

5530.8 --> 5534.400000000001
with this

5532.0 --> 5536.4
then i still eat it unless it's like

5534.4 --> 5539.04
really filled but i don't really even

5536.4 --> 5540.638999999999
really feel ever haven't really filled

5539.04 --> 5543.76
in cooking in

5540.639 --> 5546.08
since i was like 20 or something

5543.76 --> 5549.04
unless i yeah leave it on the stove for

5546.08 --> 5551.12
too long and it burns or something

5549.04 --> 5552.56
but in general i don't feel with my

5551.12 --> 5556.96
cooking attempts

5552.56 --> 5559.4400000000005
anymore so yeah then i just do it over

5556.96 --> 5560.159
and over and over again over a period of

5559.44 --> 5564.48
time to see

5560.159 --> 5567.839999999999
like what does it do to my body also

5564.48 --> 5570.08
and alter it slightly

5567.84 --> 5573.679
figure out okay would it be better like

5570.08 --> 5575.679
with more herbs of that sort or less

5573.679 --> 5577.6
right those kind of like detailed

5575.679 --> 5579.1990000000005
testing and until i find like the

5577.6 --> 5581.4400000000005
perfect formula

5579.199 --> 5583.759999999999
and then it becomes just fully automated

5581.44 --> 5586.48
i literally don't even think about it

5583.76 --> 5587.679
i don't have it written down in list of

5586.48 --> 5589.599999999999
recipes

5587.679 --> 5591.92
it's all in the memory i just know like

5589.6 --> 5594.159000000001
okay this this this this this

5591.92 --> 5596.0
and it just start doing it and usually

5594.159 --> 5599.599999999999
i'm with my mind i'm in

5596.0 --> 5604.48
somewhere else i don't really have to

5599.6 --> 5604.4800000000005
concentrate on my cooking to do it right

5609.36 --> 5612.5599999999995
unless i'm like trying something new

5611.199 --> 5614.32
then i might need a little bit more

5612.56 --> 5616.719
concentration with muscle time i'm just

5614.32 --> 5619.199
dreaming around thinking about

5616.719 --> 5621.04
yeah well my show or flat earth debates

5619.199 --> 5624.159
or

5621.04 --> 5626.639
alex jones things or yeah

5624.159 --> 5626.638999999999
everything

5627.84 --> 5631.84
but yeah i'm pretty decent cook

5636.0 --> 5640.4
and i'm i'm similarly good at cooking

5638.48 --> 5643.28
for larger groups as well

5640.4 --> 5644.32
because i've done that too like i am a

5643.28 --> 5647.5199999999995
good cook like i

5644.32 --> 5651.04
could i could do it professionally

5647.52 --> 5654.2390000000005
it's just that uh regulations and crap

5651.04 --> 5654.719
no way i'm a free cook i i do it the way

5654.239 --> 5658.08
i

5654.719 --> 5660.08
[ __ ] please like totally

5658.08 --> 5661.5199999999995
like you're not gonna make me do

5660.08 --> 5665.5199999999995
something differently

5661.52 --> 5667.679
because of freaking regulations i cook

5665.52 --> 5669.84
the way i do it like even for example

5667.679 --> 5672.8
when i make spaghetti

5669.84 --> 5673.679
and then i get in the fresh tomatoes i

5672.8 --> 5676.4800000000005
squeeze

5673.679 --> 5679.1990000000005
them by hand and nothing in the world is

5676.48 --> 5682.879999999999
going to make me do that different

5679.199 --> 5685.44
i do that right because

5682.88 --> 5687.04
it does something else i actually kind

5685.44 --> 5689.199
of magnetize

5687.04 --> 5692.239
the substance as i'm squishing it with

5689.199 --> 5695.919999999999
my hand so there is all kinds of spirit

5692.239 --> 5698.0
interaction going on with my methods

5695.92 --> 5699.36
of cooking and nobody is going to make

5698.0 --> 5701.76
me alter that

5699.36 --> 5703.5199999999995
and if i'd go professional then suddenly

5701.76 --> 5707.52
oh you have to do like this you can't do

5703.52 --> 5709.52
that and then i'd be like oh [ __ ] you

5707.52 --> 5711.92
that's not great that's not the way to

5709.52 --> 5711.92
do it

5713.119 --> 5717.04
do you want to grow any herbs or spices

5715.36 --> 5718.799999999999
oh well not on my balcony because it

5717.04 --> 5721.44
would just blow away

5718.8 --> 5723.360000000001
it's too much wind up here but i do have

5721.44 --> 5725.919999999999
some in my kitchen

5723.36 --> 5727.28
i've shown that before by the way i have

5725.92 --> 5731.119
a basil plant

5727.28 --> 5734.32
one is blooming i have oregano

5731.119 --> 5738.159
oregano and

5734.32 --> 5741.36
also laurel i have a little laurel tree

5738.159 --> 5744.48
very little just stumpy

5741.36 --> 5746.5599999999995
so i have those in my kitchen sometimes

5744.48 --> 5749.759999999999
i get like parsley

5746.56 --> 5749.76
but no not recently

5750.719 --> 5754.159
but yeah basil always fresh basil

5752.96 --> 5756.8
because fresh basil

5754.159 --> 5758.48
is a whole different world from like

5756.8 --> 5760.639
dried basil

5758.48 --> 5763.36
like i don't really like dried basil at

5760.639 --> 5765.4400000000005
all when it's fresh it's

5763.36 --> 5767.44
that's that's the good stuff like

5765.44 --> 5770.799999999999
anything

5767.44 --> 5773.04
with tomato or tomato sauce you gotta

5770.8 --> 5776.400000000001
gotta have fresh basil because dried

5773.04 --> 5776.4
basil it just doesn't do it

5779.76 --> 5783.360000000001
good cook is a skill yeah well

5783.76 --> 5786.96
dude if society freaking breaks down

5786.56 --> 5789.1990000000005
real

5786.96 --> 5791.52
serious but as long as there's still

5789.199 --> 5795.36
some local farming happening

5791.52 --> 5798.4800000000005
and like there's no more prefab products

5795.36 --> 5801.119
or whatever and certainly cooks

5798.48 --> 5803.919999999999
become very needed then yeah i could

5801.119 --> 5805.44
absolutely get a job as a cook

5803.92 --> 5807.1990000000005
right because hey if that all happens

5805.44 --> 5807.919999999999
then the freaking regulations isn't

5807.199 --> 5810.638999999999
gonna matter

5807.92 --> 5811.36
[ __ ] anymore anyway so then yeah as long

5810.639 --> 5815.52
as i'm

5811.36 --> 5816.159
free to do it my way hey and any really

5815.52 --> 5818.4800000000005
good cook

5816.159 --> 5819.599999999999
is like this have you ever noticed that

5818.48 --> 5822.239
in restaurants

5819.6 --> 5823.360000000001
like the really good cooks like they

5822.239 --> 5825.119
have an ego

5823.36 --> 5826.5599999999995
and you don't freaking tell them how to

5825.119 --> 5829.92
do their work ever

5826.56 --> 5833.119000000001
or they'll they'll get really pissed off

5829.92 --> 5836.08
and i'm like that too it's like no no i

5833.119 --> 5841.759999999999
really know how to make what i make you

5836.08 --> 5844.32
can't tell me [ __ ]

5841.76 --> 5844.96
because i know how to make it tasty like

5844.32 --> 5848.159
to

5844.96 --> 5848.159
pretty much everyone

5848.639 --> 5852.96
i've never had a complaint by the way

5850.96 --> 5853.6
from anyone ever about my cooking

5852.96 --> 5855.84
quality

5853.6 --> 5855.84
ever

5859.6 --> 5863.6
yeah so for me too yeah absolutely is a

5862.719 --> 5866.2390000000005
tactic

5863.6 --> 5869.6
is like hey if i'm gonna try to like

5866.239 --> 5871.28
kind of pick up on a girl or a lady

5869.6 --> 5874.2390000000005
what do you think i'm gonna do i'm gonna

5871.28 --> 5876.88
invite her over and say like hey

5874.239 --> 5879.678999999999
what would you like me to make like what

5876.88 --> 5882.08
do you really like as a meal

5879.679 --> 5884.2390000000005
not just because it's easy but what is

5882.08 --> 5886.0
in your memory of like oh i really like

5884.239 --> 5887.678999999999
this

5886.0 --> 5889.92
let's see if i can make something like

5887.679 --> 5889.92
that

5890.08 --> 5894.32
and if it would be like in my range that

5892.4 --> 5895.5199999999995
would be a big plus because then i know

5894.32 --> 5898.639
i can

5895.52 --> 5900.56
satisfy her over time with my cooking

5898.639 --> 5901.76
right so yeah that's one of the things

5900.56 --> 5911.84
that i would do

5901.76 --> 5911.84
and i've done that very many many times

5916.48 --> 5923.5199999999995
don't over undercook chicken unless you

5920.239 --> 5925.36
no but tiny wombo i what i meant with

5923.52 --> 5926.159000000001
regulations is like the cooking

5925.36 --> 5929.199
profession

5926.159 --> 5932.5599999999995
right how it works now in industrial

5929.199 --> 5934.4
in the in the society it's all kinds of

5932.56 --> 5937.04
stupid [ __ ]

5934.4 --> 5939.839999999999
you have to get all these papers and

5937.04 --> 5939.84
things

5943.679 --> 5948.719
imagine how good most food tasted 50 100

5947.28 --> 5951.44
years

5948.719 --> 5952.4
before all the industrialization of well

5951.44 --> 5955.04
i don't think

5952.4 --> 5958.0
it's that much off you know if you get

5955.04 --> 5961.36
really good quality organic food

5958.0 --> 5962.239
like the raw stuff especially you make

5961.36 --> 5964.5599999999995
it yourself

5962.239 --> 5965.28
it's not that far off a hundred years

5964.56 --> 5967.280000000001
ago

5965.28 --> 5968.8
besides 100 years ago there were many

5967.28 --> 5971.84
other problems

5968.8 --> 5974.320000000001
right 100 years ago

5971.84 --> 5975.360000000001
there was just the industrialization had

5974.32 --> 5977.4
just happened

5975.36 --> 5978.719
now if you're talking about

5977.4 --> 5982.0
pre-industrialization

5978.719 --> 5985.52
yeah the food would have been pristine

5982.0 --> 5985.52
there was no pollution [ __ ]

5985.76 --> 5990.400000000001
there was no artificial fertilizer and

5989.119 --> 5992.48
all that

5990.4 --> 5994.08
in the old days yeah food would have

5992.48 --> 5997.04
been really good

5994.08 --> 5998.0
overall then the industrialization

5997.04 --> 6001.28
happened and then

5998.0 --> 6002.08
the poisoning started to happen and the

6001.28 --> 6005.679
medical

6002.08 --> 6005.679
system started to happen

6007.199 --> 6010.799999999999
but hey if you if you cook like i do and

6010.32 --> 6014.799999999999
you get

6010.8 --> 6014.8
you're really careful with your sources

6015.119 --> 6019.759999999999
of your ingredients i don't think it's

6017.84 --> 6023.119000000001
that far off

6019.76 --> 6023.52
now if you grow it yourself every part

6023.119 --> 6026.799999999999
of it

6023.52 --> 6030.56
it would be even better

6026.8 --> 6033.119000000001
then i think it would probably surpass

6030.56 --> 6034.56
how good it used to be over 100 years

6033.119 --> 6037.5199999999995
ago

6034.56 --> 6038.96
right because we have many more things

6037.52 --> 6043.040000000001
available now we have

6038.96 --> 6046.4800000000005
knowledge of spices that are in reach

6043.04 --> 6050.32
that's just like that that wasn't there

6046.48 --> 6051.759999999999
just think about it like 300 years ago

6050.32 --> 6055.04
in europe we didn't even know what

6051.76 --> 6055.04
freaking potatoes were

6055.28 --> 6058.96
if you accept the official history that

6058.56 --> 6061.280000000001
is

6058.96 --> 6062.8
right and there's many more of these

6061.28 --> 6066.0
examples like now

6062.8 --> 6069.52
we got everything from everywhere

6066.0 --> 6070.96
that wasn't there right so you can

6069.52 --> 6073.6
actually surpass

6070.96 --> 6077.28
that quality as long as you really

6073.6 --> 6080.88
source your food sources carefully

6077.28 --> 6083.92
so yes we can

6080.88 --> 6086.08
potentially cook better

6083.92 --> 6089.6
than pre-industrialization but you got

6086.08 --> 6089.6
to be very careful when picking your

6090.84 --> 6096.400000000001
sources

6092.56 --> 6096.400000000001
and preferably all grow it yourself

6098.88 --> 6107.36
like because nothing is going to surpass

6102.48 --> 6110.718999999999
a a chicken you've raised yourself

6107.36 --> 6113.599999999999
and fed organically give plenty of

6110.719 --> 6116.56
just good treatment good environment if

6113.6 --> 6118.639
you're going to slaughter it yourself

6116.56 --> 6120.88
get over that because the first time's

6118.639 --> 6124.0
going to be pretty brutal

6120.88 --> 6126.8
on your spirit and then

6124.0 --> 6127.6
just prepare it nothing is going to

6126.8 --> 6130.0
surpass that

6127.6 --> 6131.119000000001
nothing you could buy in any supermarket

6130.0 --> 6134.56
or

6131.119 --> 6137.119
right a butcher is going to surpass

6134.56 --> 6138.88
like a creature you organically raised

6137.119 --> 6141.92
in person

6138.88 --> 6145.36
i'm so hungry right now

6141.92 --> 6145.36
yeah well you brought it up

6145.92 --> 6149.84
i'm getting kind of hungry too

6154.56 --> 6163.84
all right

6167.679 --> 6172.96
yeah but i'm really happy that i got

6169.92 --> 6172.96
good cooking skills

6173.04 --> 6177.44
it's also kind of silly because i you do

6175.44 --> 6179.119
take it for granted

6177.44 --> 6180.638999999999
like if you're really good at cooking i

6179.119 --> 6182.719
think a lot of people just

6180.639 --> 6184.639
accidentally take it for granted they

6182.719 --> 6186.32
don't realize that it's really a skill

6184.639 --> 6187.679
that there's a whole bunch of people out

6186.32 --> 6190.48
there that are can

6187.679 --> 6192.56
cook for [ __ ] like they can't do it they

6190.48 --> 6193.119
just they mess up every time they don't

6192.56 --> 6196.0
know

6193.119 --> 6198.0
they don't understand the balance of the

6196.0 --> 6199.76
spices and how it tastes really where

6198.0 --> 6202.48
they just don't get it

6199.76 --> 6205.84
and like their entire life they just

6202.48 --> 6205.839999999999
don't get it

6207.119 --> 6210.32
eating the pet chicken

6211.36 --> 6215.119
well when you say it like that it's a

6213.119 --> 6215.599999999999
tragedy yeah guns have never owned no

6215.119 --> 6219.5199999999995
but

6215.6 --> 6221.6
i don't mean just a regular pet chicken

6219.52 --> 6224.639
like you would have to breed and raise

6221.6 --> 6226.4800000000005
it specific like a meat chicken

6224.639 --> 6228.2390000000005
right it's a different type of chicken

6226.48 --> 6231.599999999999
as an egg chicken

6228.239 --> 6232.0
because yeah if you slaughter and egg

6231.6 --> 6235.4400000000005
chicken

6232.0 --> 6235.44
that is kind of a tragedy

6237.36 --> 6240.96
but meat chicken is just they're just

6239.52 --> 6247.84
meat hats anyway

6240.96 --> 6247.84
they're kind of stupid

6265.6 --> 6269.6
what is my favorite meal i cook

6270.08 --> 6275.84
well the favorites i don't make them too

6272.239 --> 6275.839999999999
often because they're a lot of work

6276.08 --> 6282.239
but what i typically make the most

6279.36 --> 6283.28
and i still love it every time every

6282.239 --> 6286.08
time i love it

6283.28 --> 6288.4
is a hamburger it's just a standard

6286.08 --> 6292.0
orwenian hamburger

6288.4 --> 6292.799999999999
just bread baked onions the onions baked

6292.0 --> 6295.52
with

6292.8 --> 6295.52
with the beef

6296.4 --> 6301.599999999999
uh like fresh chili pepper

6299.76 --> 6304.719
did this is the order of it you got the

6301.6 --> 6307.76
bread fresh chili pepper

6304.719 --> 6310.4
on there the baked onions

6307.76 --> 6312.320000000001
dropped on there then some a little bit

6310.4 --> 6314.48
of chili sauce

6312.32 --> 6317.759999999999
so that it kind of stick that gets

6314.48 --> 6321.199
sticky on top of that the hamburger

6317.76 --> 6324.2390000000005
then on top of that uh

6321.199 --> 6325.119
ketchup don't overdo it with any of the

6324.239 --> 6328.48
sauces

6325.119 --> 6332.48
on that lattice

6328.48 --> 6336.32
on that tomato slices then the final

6332.48 --> 6338.4
piece of bread with uh

6336.32 --> 6340.159
with mayonnaise on that that's an

6338.4 --> 6342.96
arwanian hamburger

6340.159 --> 6344.239
you can't miss but every time i finish

6342.96 --> 6347.119
up eating i'm a mess

6344.239 --> 6350.718999999999
like sauce all over me but god is that

6347.119 --> 6353.599999999999
delicious i must have eaten like

6350.719 --> 6359.84
at least a thousand of them by now

6353.6 --> 6359.84
probably more

6364.239 --> 6368.5599999999995
that's right homemade hamburgers are

6365.92 --> 6368.56
fantastic

6368.719 --> 6373.84
if if like the hamburger meat quality is

6371.679 --> 6373.84
good

6377.6 --> 6383.1990000000005
baked hamburgers well baking uh

6380.639 --> 6384.96
i effectively just originally i started

6383.199 --> 6388.08
doing it in olive oil so just

6384.96 --> 6391.36
take a cooking of frying pan

6388.08 --> 6395.36
olive oil put the hamburgers in

6391.36 --> 6397.599999999999
there and the onions at the same time

6395.36 --> 6399.04
because yeah it mixes in like the flavor

6397.6 --> 6400.88
and everything mixes and it's really

6399.04 --> 6404.0
good like that

6400.88 --> 6406.4800000000005
and eventually

6404.0 --> 6407.92
that was which was originally all of all

6406.48 --> 6410.718999999999
it becomes pure

6407.92 --> 6414.56
hamburger grease literally it's it's

6410.719 --> 6416.719
grease and i keep reusing it

6414.56 --> 6417.6
as long as i like don't really overheat

6416.719 --> 6420.4800000000005
it or anything

6417.6 --> 6423.280000000001
you can reuse it and it it just becomes

6420.48 --> 6425.28
more and more and more tasty over time

6423.28 --> 6429.599999999999
then you eventually like have hamburger
