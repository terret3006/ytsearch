6.85 --> 36.92
[Music]

37.4 --> 45.12
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.49 --> 46.86
earlybird number 247 I'm your host

45.12 --> 48.57
Arwen and before we start the show

46.86 --> 51.68
please don't forget to share it on any

48.57 --> 54.81
platform you deem fit they deem fit

51.68 --> 56.76
accept Facebook and also if you haven't

54.81 --> 58.410000000000004
already subscribed to my channel and hit

56.76 --> 60.269999999999996
the bell notification so you know when

58.41 --> 64.08
I'm going live which is normally 2 p.m.

60.27 --> 66.92
Amsterdam time every day also please

64.08 --> 71.00999999999999
support my show through Super chats

66.92 --> 78.57000000000001
PayPal my patreon and my GoFundMe much

71.01 --> 81.09
obliged so today it's suddenly turned

78.57 --> 83.83999999999999
around which kind of surprising for

81.09 --> 83.84
Wednesday Oh

85.25 --> 93.8
Meijer look at that still bit cloudy but

89.61 --> 96.77
yeah son look at that

93.8 --> 103.44
it's really nice

96.77 --> 106.38
haven't seen any chemtrails really I did

103.44 --> 111.84
see some planes but they basically left

106.38 --> 113.82
calm trail so yeah nice nice weather on

111.84 --> 115.97
Wednesday no less so I'm gonna have a

113.82 --> 120.38999999999999
sunny paper around for a change

115.97 --> 122.729
but that's good anyway yeah I don't have

120.39 --> 130.59
to marry coffee now because I already

122.729 --> 136.7
drank it but I do have a huge Apple it's

130.59 --> 139.7
like an eighth of my head size and good

136.7 --> 139.7
blueberries

140.47 --> 160.84
oh so good auntie so I was up very early

154.39 --> 164.73999999999998
today as I was also I have also gone to

160.84 --> 170.47
bed relatively early what is it like a

164.74 --> 176.20000000000002
quarter past one so I enjoyed a full

170.47 --> 183.57999999999998
sunny morning I'm all mellowed out I had

176.2 --> 187.70999999999998
a couple of joints already so man so

183.58 --> 187.71
much has happened it's just incredible

189.78 --> 197.14000000000001
almost bit nervous about it but um it's

194.86 --> 198.55
good it is basically good I'm gonna look

197.14 --> 203.91
in chat who's there

198.55 --> 206.70000000000002
let's see so ehm was there pretty early

203.91 --> 210.07
Daniel

206.7 --> 217.54
Nick Amanda young

210.07 --> 221.2
/ moko fyodor dostoyevsky Steve Dave

217.54 --> 228.45
Johnson sceptic nine thirty nine ninety

221.2 --> 238.26
three six I mean pumpkin God faith right

228.45 --> 241.82999999999998
flat accord music secret Asian man yeah

238.26 --> 241.82999999999998
good to see you all

242.519 --> 250.63
that was quite a day yesterday again

246.13 --> 253.63
second time except that I that I left

250.63 --> 255.76
the debates so I don't know how many of

253.63 --> 261.19
you have seen it

255.76 --> 264.07
I basically popped in at the last 15-20

261.19 --> 267.49
minutes of that while it was premiering

264.07 --> 270.7
so I didn't see ya I didn't even hear

267.49 --> 273.7
back the part where I was at but yeah I

270.7 --> 276.31
left you might have noticed and I spoke

273.7 --> 280.36
it out very loudly I think that I wasn't

276.31 --> 285.58
muted so I got across they were not

280.36 --> 287.68
gonna respond to my question which is

285.58 --> 289.40999999999997
kind of my new housekeeping question

287.68 --> 292.36
it's my Orwellian housekeeping question

289.41 --> 301.03000000000003
and his scientific evidence of the speed

292.36 --> 305.47
of light and yeah they said they didn't

301.03 --> 313.65999999999997
have to because of their quantum body of

305.47 --> 315.31
science and well as I predicted as they

313.66 --> 318.22
basically stated they weren't gonna

315.31 --> 323.44
address it so the entire thing was

318.22 --> 326.95000000000005
basically a typical Jong style clown

323.44 --> 329.52
headpiece not addressing the question in

326.95 --> 335.59
this case which is very very

329.52 --> 339.479
in-your-face shameful there I think he's

335.59 --> 343.29999999999995
trying to bluff it and this whole thing

339.479 --> 346.15
you know look I think John's a

343.3 --> 349.12
gatekeeper for real but not for flat

346.15 --> 356.31
earth but for quantum mechanics it's in

349.12 --> 356.31
his name you know it's it's there so

356.55 --> 366.04
it's probably personal although it might

360.19 --> 368.59
be some kind of I just say scientists

366.04 --> 371.65000000000003
small scientists conspiracy among the

368.59 --> 373.21
quantum mechanic scientists who wanted

371.65 --> 375.48999999999995
like keep their funding or something

373.21 --> 378.31
maybe that's the cause why he's doing

375.49 --> 380.74
what he's doing because he's personally

378.31 --> 381.94
invested into that research he does know

380.74 --> 384.49
a lot about it so I wouldn't be

381.94 --> 390.61
surprised but he is acting like a

384.49 --> 392.83
gatekeeper and yeah I'm not gonna be

390.61 --> 396.7
tolerating that and neither are a lot of

392.83 --> 402.12
other people so among them right the

396.7 --> 404.89
hand who yeah III he is he did a little

402.12 --> 405.37
livestream yesterday I saw him I saw his

404.89 --> 410.02
face

405.37 --> 416.74
and I don't know I basically offered him

410.02 --> 420.90999999999997
like we should get a quantum mechanics

416.74 --> 423.76
exploration roundtable group and just

420.91 --> 426.15000000000003
talk about it on a weekly basis see how

423.76 --> 428.83
many people we can get together and

426.15 --> 430.9
specifically tied to that subject and I

428.83 --> 433.84
already have kind of plans like let's

430.9 --> 436.96
just delve in all the material the

433.84 --> 439.23999999999995
history of it there's different concepts

436.96 --> 445.39
that came out of it how they came out of

439.24 --> 448.92
it and really really get to know it but

445.39 --> 451.41999999999996
not necessarily just be blinded by the

448.92 --> 454.66
incredible technical detail that it

451.42 --> 459.04
contains but actually approach it from

454.66 --> 461.41
the roots up with the understanding now

459.04 --> 464.92
of putting off presuppositions

461.41 --> 467.23
definitely being in there and I will

464.92 --> 469.75
work on back back engineering it it's

467.23 --> 472.62
not going to be that much of work for me

469.75 --> 476.02
actually because I just see it now

472.62 --> 478.36
it's gonna be very easy for me to do I

476.02 --> 480.72999999999996
don't even have to really spend a lot of

478.36 --> 483.82
cognitive attention to it even to do it

480.73 --> 486.8
now because I just see it now it's been

483.82 --> 490.17
unveiled to me

486.8 --> 493.92
that I was right in my suspicions and I

490.17 --> 497.64000000000004
see now why so who knows what's gonna

493.92 --> 499.59000000000003
happen but really get into the quantum

497.64 --> 503.65999999999997
mechanics and kind of like we did with

499.59 --> 506.42999999999995
flat earth and with psychology or

503.66 --> 510.45000000000005
debating techniques because we have to

506.43 --> 514.94
not forget that John did definitely help

510.45 --> 520.08
us with that as did Riley also a lot

514.94 --> 525.48
thank god he's not like fanatically John

520.08 --> 526.62
obsessed in this in this argument so we

525.48 --> 529.5
do have to thank him for that

526.62 --> 532.62
we work that out now this is gonna

529.5 --> 535.35
happen whether he likes it or not and he

532.62 --> 538.35
might be acting kind of like a baller in

535.35 --> 540.39
this specific sense using the same type

538.35 --> 543.0
of techniques he has already displayed

540.39 --> 548.49
it now in this presentation which was

543.0 --> 554.34
just a giant a giant straw man very

548.49 --> 556.5
obviously so kind of admittedly and I'm

554.34 --> 560.0
not admitted it just they say it's

556.5 --> 563.04
justified it's a justified straw man

560.0 --> 564.66
anyway whatever designation that's

563.04 --> 567.6899999999999
you're supposed to give that type of

564.66 --> 570.0
thing I it's never been my expertise how

567.69 --> 577.58
ask Riley about it if I really need to

570.0 --> 577.58
know let's get some blueberries in there

583.48 --> 595.009
they're so sweet and very the aromas

590.209 --> 598.7299999999999
very sweet with a nice a vitamin C

595.009 --> 601.299
aftertaste sourness it's just this stuff

598.73 --> 601.299
so good

612.31 --> 619.5799999999999
well Looby loo it is part of my show

615.94 --> 619.94
Alphaeus sock troll harassing me for no

619.58 --> 622.76
reason

619.94 --> 626.0600000000001
but yeah it's part of what I do there's

622.76 --> 628.49
actually people like x3 20 that

626.06 --> 631.64
especially likes it when I do that he

628.49 --> 633.23
but yeah to each his own but this is

631.64 --> 637.16
kind of a it's meant as a brighter

633.23 --> 640.07
morning breakfast show in that sense

637.16 --> 642.8199999999999
aimed at the United States for those

640.07 --> 646.94
that do get up early and just want to

642.82 --> 649.49
think use their thinking skills and get

646.94 --> 653.11
into complex subjects in the morning in

649.49 --> 656.0600000000001
a quiet kind of quiet setting people not

653.11 --> 662.27
bickering and just have a nice breakfast

656.06 --> 665.0889999999999
and a good good conversation yeah that

662.27 --> 668.24
used to be like family tradition back in

665.089 --> 670.94
the day for a lot of families and now

668.24 --> 675.08
with all the media TV social media it's

670.94 --> 678.35
all scattered that it's it doesn't work

675.08 --> 682.22
the same when you have electronics in

678.35 --> 684.74
between and yeah since you're seeing me

682.22 --> 689.39
it's kind of the second best the only

684.74 --> 692.779
problem is you can't really visually sit

689.39 --> 696.9399999999999
there and respond with your I can't see

692.779 --> 696.9399999999999
your physical response but that's it I

699.08 --> 704.4200000000001
[Music]

700.6 --> 708.14
just know that in my family setting

704.42 --> 715.76
that's gonna be a thing we are gonna

708.14 --> 720.89
have a debating culture and the funny

715.76 --> 725.0889999999999
thing is I'll probably be into it my my

720.89 --> 727.1899999999999
wife might be yeah she might get a

725.089 --> 730.4590000000001
little tired of it eventually because

727.19 --> 731.23
that happens it's inevitable it happens

730.459 --> 735.829
every time

731.23 --> 739.04
but my kids oh my god yeah well if

735.829 --> 742.3299999999999
they're gonna have like well the same

739.04 --> 745.64
kind of build

742.33 --> 749.45
energetically physically as I have then

745.64 --> 752.0
oh my god they once they catch on to the

749.45 --> 756.589
debating culture that I've been they

752.0 --> 758.779
will probably just astound the [ __ ] out

756.589 --> 762.95
of me with knowledge that they will

758.779 --> 766.73
present me so crystal clear at like very

762.95 --> 771.769
young age between eight and twelve like

766.73 --> 773.69
I did that back then and I just can't

771.769 --> 776.48
wait to see that again I don't know it's

773.69 --> 780.5
just us dreaming dreaming dreaming but a

776.48 --> 783.35
family for me look I'm not gonna

780.5 --> 787.13
underestimate how impactful that will be

783.35 --> 789.019
and even though to the outside world who

787.13 --> 791.149
doesn't really know me it may appear to

789.019 --> 793.279
like just another typical family with

791.149 --> 796.06
people that may have some kind of issues

793.279 --> 799.55
and might get very emotional sometimes

796.06 --> 803.39
but for me and for my children and

799.55 --> 806.0
hopefully for my wife we will see the

803.39 --> 809.48
valued in between where others will not

806.0 --> 813.26
and it'll be absolutely astounding it'll

809.48 --> 818.11
be a magical family in a in a good way

813.26 --> 818.11
like in the light way in the pathway

820.48 --> 826.76
dreaming on yep

823.61 --> 837.32
Looby loo I have no children that I know

826.76 --> 840.829
of unfortunately I why I wasn't ready

837.32 --> 843.2900000000001
for it and but that didn't yeah I

840.829 --> 847.13
basically surrendered to that and then

843.29 --> 850.399
was a liberal pretty much during all my

847.13 --> 852.13
relationships and that doesn't really

850.399 --> 855.97
help

852.13 --> 855.97
now retrospect

856.06 --> 860.2199999999999
I kind of missed a couple of

857.8 --> 863.4699999999999
opportunities because some of my exes I

860.22 --> 865.27
would have really probably loved having

863.47 --> 868.27
children and with them I know that they

865.27 --> 870.88
now have children with others but

868.27 --> 873.67
because I was basically not in the

870.88 --> 877.87
attitude that I was available for that

873.67 --> 881.11
and just wanted to goof around and yeah

877.87 --> 883.27
experience more sex and all that and and

881.11 --> 886.69
just romance and oh yeah it was in it

883.27 --> 889.66
for the experience itself then yeah that

886.69 --> 898.74
doesn't work for them

889.66 --> 900.5799999999999
apparently anymore so it's just what

898.74 --> 908.37
what's going on here

900.58 --> 924.3100000000001
oh my god that's ridiculous

908.37 --> 935.05
that is so troll ish that's yeah yeah

924.31 --> 940.7199999999999
Lottie says that's a they know Steve he

935.05 --> 944.62
was just being nice yeah the the Lottie

940.72 --> 948.01
ban is off I know that I did said that a

944.62 --> 952.08
lot before but a lot he's been behaving

948.01 --> 954.49
nice in chats in my presence and

952.08 --> 958.12
whatever he was going through he seems

954.49 --> 960.49
to finally have toned down and I don't

958.12 --> 962.47
know he made like a really funny remark

960.49 --> 964.8100000000001
the other day so I just thought like

962.47 --> 968.6800000000001
yeah you can't come up with that kind of

964.81 --> 973.0889999999999
[ __ ] if you are in a rage so I said okay

968.68 --> 975.3299999999999
for that i unlock you you know you gotta

973.089 --> 980.23
reward excellence

975.33 --> 982.0300000000001
you just have to or it'll go away it's

980.23 --> 984.439
universal you've got to reward

982.03 --> 986.73
excellence or I'll go away

984.439 --> 996.809
even if you kind of don't like the

986.73 --> 1002.869
person yeah right and Internet

996.809 --> 1007.279
misunderstanding sure it was alright

1002.869 --> 1010.73
anyway fresh starts we'll see what

1007.279 --> 1014.119
happens yeah Wow

1010.73 --> 1022.6990000000001
55 watching that bad hmm

1014.119 --> 1030.38
oh did he now ran T I wouldn't know I I

1022.699 --> 1033.639
tend to not watch videos out there like

1030.38 --> 1037.49
that there are so many I lost track I

1033.639 --> 1041.089
did save a couple on my computer maybe

1037.49 --> 1042.949
one day I should like make a all the

1041.089 --> 1045.4089999999999
troll videos made about our wind

1042.949 --> 1047.6200000000001
sequence it'll probably last like an

1045.409 --> 1047.6200000000001
hour

1053.32 --> 1057.789
it's pretty insane what's out there

1063.809 --> 1076.71
hmm but anyway where was I oh yeah I got

1071.369 --> 1086.629
a new patreon somebody how was it he

1076.71 --> 1089.749
said to me in oh yeah proficient pirate

1086.629 --> 1093.09
that was awesome

1089.749 --> 1096.719
so thanks proficient pirate for becoming

1093.09 --> 1100.9499999999998
a I think use yeah you said you were

1096.719 --> 1106.0700000000002
gonna be a monthly patreon so thank you

1100.95 --> 1106.07
very much for that means a lot to me oh

1107.69 --> 1111.3300000000002
yeah

1108.899 --> 1114.9289999999999
by the way I almost forgot something

1111.33 --> 1119.1589999999999
that just happened yesterday evening or

1114.929 --> 1121.919
yesterday night I was just what was it

1119.159 --> 1125.8200000000002

1121.919 --> 1128.8490000000002
one hey you know what what's that yeah I

1125.82 --> 1132.1689999999999
want blueberries Thank You skeptic 9 3 9

1128.849 --> 1138.119
9 3 6 for the $2 super chair donations

1132.169 --> 1141.719
actually this this yeah little bit more

1138.119 --> 1145.4689999999998
full is pretty much $2 it wasn't that

1141.719 --> 1149.1290000000001
expensive like it's it was the cheapest

1145.469 --> 1150.749
little thing in there got strawberries

1149.129 --> 1156.2099999999998
and other all the other berries they

1150.749 --> 1159.419
were like 250 to three yards but this

1156.21 --> 1162.919
one was like 180 so that should be about

1159.419 --> 1168.3890000000001
$2 and it's all organic it's fantastic

1162.919 --> 1172.0990000000002
it's really really well done and they

1168.389 --> 1175.1589999999999
must have tons of that stuff

1172.099 --> 1181.249
so I hope they make a good profit

1175.159 --> 1184.3790000000001
because I want good organic fruit

1181.249 --> 1186.95
Gardens you know what did ya fruit farms

1184.379 --> 1186.9499999999998
yeah what

1187.429 --> 1200.69
orchids no or what do you call that guys

1202.309 --> 1210.48
where you have fruit trees and bushes or

1206.489 --> 1212.58
or chart that's yeah I couldn't I

1210.48 --> 1213.119
couldn't get it at orchard that's it

1212.58 --> 1216.4499999999998
yeah

1213.119 --> 1219.299
good orchards especially if they're

1216.45 --> 1221.3990000000001
local but even if they're just very good

1219.299 --> 1225.119
somewhere I don't know in France or

1221.399 --> 1227.7589999999998
something they they need a good profit

1225.119 --> 1232.9499999999998
they need that extra security to get

1227.759 --> 1237.059
through all the yeah de to survive the

1232.95 --> 1242.759
the trade wars so that's why I say I

1237.059 --> 1248.97
hope they get a good profit they deserve

1242.759 --> 1250.8890000000001
it I'm not necessarily talking about the

1248.97 --> 1253.1390000000001
people trading in it and selling it I

1250.889 --> 1255.119
just really hope that the people that do

1253.139 --> 1258.32
the production it that they get a good

1255.119 --> 1264.299
profit and they need it they deserve it

1258.32 --> 1269.519
and they need a bit of security for the

1264.299 --> 1272.6689999999999
future so that we don't run out of the

1269.519 --> 1278.58
good stuff even if things get a little

1272.669 --> 1281.8790000000001
tense it's very important so make sure

1278.58 --> 1285.119
to support your organic farmer if you

1281.879 --> 1290.1
have one unless you're just yeah making

1285.119 --> 1294.119
your own stuff or if yeah if you're not

1290.1 --> 1296.1
if you're in a very urban area yeah you

1294.119 --> 1298.1999999999998
don't you're not very close to farms you

1296.1 --> 1301.9989999999998
don't have that ability then just go to

1298.2 --> 1304.769
a reliable organic supermarket and yeah

1301.999 --> 1307.98
look into them what they do how they

1304.769 --> 1311.929
treat their farmers and all that make

1307.98 --> 1316.259
sure yeah you do your best to support

1311.929 --> 1319.489
the right cause and not just a bunch of

1316.259 --> 1319.489
money-grubbing people

1323.2 --> 1330.65
you need a milkshake mmm oh man these

1327.74 --> 1336.28
blueberries are so good this Apple is

1330.65 --> 1339.17
gonna take me I couldn't finish this

1336.28 --> 1342.22
this is like an entire dinner sized

1339.17 --> 1346.9
Apple just look at it look at this thing

1342.22 --> 1353.78
it's a planet look at that

1346.9 --> 1355.6100000000001
it's Mars away it's Venus its Mars again

1353.78 --> 1363.77
oh it awaits its is it the Blood Moon

1355.61 --> 1368.03
yes what is it right oh yeah I almost

1363.77 --> 1372.28
lost track yesterday evening wow that

1368.03 --> 1376.67
took like 15 minutes yesterday evening I

1372.28 --> 1378.83
was watching a video or playing a game

1376.67 --> 1380.8100000000002
and then took a smoke outside on the

1378.83 --> 1384.74
balcony was like oh my god it's

1380.81 --> 1386.99
beautiful so clear moonlight and you can

1384.74 --> 1389.24
even see the stars no clouds and really

1386.99 --> 1392.57
nice in an evening moonlight was kind of

1389.24 --> 1399.83
bright though and then I looked and then

1392.57 --> 1401.72
I thought wait what what is that so yeah

1399.83 --> 1405.77
I noticed something about the moon I

1401.72 --> 1410.06
thought that looks odd because it was

1405.77 --> 1412.61
just sitting there and it looked like

1410.06 --> 1416.57
there was a chunk out of it and it was

1412.61 --> 1422.6299999999999
pointed down it like like two horns

1416.57 --> 1424.73
pointing down like that it was weird it

1422.63 --> 1431.0
didn't look like the normal moon shadow

1424.73 --> 1433.76
oh yeah the normally very weird like how

1431.0 --> 1435.74
it was placed never was a very

1433.76 --> 1438.8
unexpected I thought okay that's odd

1435.74 --> 1441.2
hmmm wish I could like photograph that

1438.8 --> 1444.1699999999998
besides with anything like yeah my

1441.2 --> 1448.46
webcam wouldn't would barely take notice

1444.17 --> 1451.97
of it they finally had a p900

1448.46 --> 1455.54
please support my GoFundMe but then

1451.97 --> 1457.97
afterward like after an hour I think I

1455.54 --> 1462.04
went back and just check hey how's it

1457.97 --> 1468.04
lookin at okay and the moon was

1462.04 --> 1471.17
completely full so I thought okay that

1468.04 --> 1473.3899999999999
must have been some kind of eclipse that

1471.17 --> 1479.96
I was staring at without even realizing

1473.39 --> 1482.1200000000001
it pretty interesting and yeah I put it

1479.96 --> 1485.78
out in the Skype chat and other people

1482.12 --> 1488.81
even said yeah like yeah it's partial

1485.78 --> 1491.24
lunar eclipse and it's gonna be on the

1488.81 --> 1495.32
flat earth debates after this so despite

1491.24 --> 1497.45
all the issues I am gonna be very

1495.32 --> 1499.49
interested to see what they gathered in

1497.45 --> 1501.98
material how many videos have been made

1499.49 --> 1504.08
about this that are gonna be dragged

1501.98 --> 1506.8700000000001
into it it's gonna be an interesting

1504.08 --> 1509.24
event the Flat Earth debate is probably

1506.87 --> 1511.1599999999999
so I will get in there and just probably

1509.24 --> 1513.68
listen a lot maybe comment here and

1511.16 --> 1515.69
there but yeah I witnessed it without

1513.68 --> 1519.74
even realizing basically looking at it's

1515.69 --> 1523.4
like okay that's unusual because it

1519.74 --> 1526.46
wasn't like an even it was like exactly

1523.4 --> 1530.41
in the middle when I looked at it so it

1526.46 --> 1536.48
looked like it was just a very odd

1530.41 --> 1544.88
oriented moon that was out of place so

1536.48 --> 1550.09
that it was a weird experience well

1544.88 --> 1556.22
Looby loo that the that the apparent

1550.09 --> 1560.02
moon and sun covering are in the Hindu

1556.22 --> 1563.57
cosmology attributed to these black and

1560.02 --> 1569.44
invisible discs although I personally

1563.57 --> 1572.36
think that the effect is more like the

1569.44 --> 1575.3200000000002
closing off of a tunnel through which

1572.36 --> 1575.32
the light comes

1576.16 --> 1580.72
that's more how it looks to me it really

1578.86 --> 1582.9399999999998
does look like the light is actually

1580.72 --> 1587.5
coming through a tunnel and that tunnel

1582.94 --> 1589.78
is then being closed off like a more

1587.5 --> 1591.34
sealed like a boulder is rolling in

1589.78 --> 1600.73
front of it

1591.34 --> 1604.27
closing off a cave that idea that's what

1600.73 --> 1607.39
my intuition tells me kind of that's

1604.27 --> 1611.73
what it says that the closest thing I

1607.39 --> 1613.8100000000002
could logically interpret it as visually

1611.73 --> 1621.22
but I don't think there is anything

1613.81 --> 1623.98
physical out there and not really just

1621.22 --> 1626.26
like and I don't even know how it

1623.98 --> 1631.29
manifests but it's likely some kind of

1626.26 --> 1635.89
electrical nature deriving from a

1631.29 --> 1640.4099999999999
ever-present electrical field that just

1635.89 --> 1640.41
has these light visuals as a side effect

1641.97 --> 1648.88
including the moon and yeah

1645.99 --> 1660.1200000000001
predominantly the Sun of course which is

1648.88 --> 1663.73
very influential but yeah curious to see

1660.12 --> 1665.53
more on that in the debates but yeah

1663.73 --> 1669.27
that's it for me I just saw it without

1665.53 --> 1669.27
not without realizing it

1672.73 --> 1675.859
[Music]

1677.5 --> 1681.4
so what else

1684.39 --> 1687.5990000000002
[Music]

1692.78 --> 1699.84
yeah yeah Randy was on a little bit

1696.87 --> 1706.29
earlier what's kind of interesting

1699.84 --> 1710.73
oh yeah flat flat water has been

1706.29 --> 1717.09
uploading a couple of new videos about

1710.73 --> 1719.1
yeah evil Disney related yeah typical

1717.09 --> 1721.4399999999998
stuff for him

1719.1 --> 1723.4199999999998
not so much Bible oriented but more the

1721.44 --> 1725.97
conspiracy side of him it was kind of

1723.42 --> 1731.48
interesting if you like flat waters for

1725.97 --> 1734.04
videos that's a flat water Flat Earth

1731.48 --> 1738.54
use but yeah he's been there for a long

1734.04 --> 1741.8
time I got into his videos before I

1738.54 --> 1741.8
started my own channel

1748.61 --> 1755.899
I always found his videos in particular

1751.61 --> 1758.6899999999998
very fascinating because I remembered

1755.899 --> 1760.58
them so vividly from my visions from

1758.69 --> 1762.6490000000001
years before that that's one of the

1760.58 --> 1765.769
things that just astounded me like he

1762.649 --> 1770.57
ever I recognized that voice I heard

1765.769 --> 1772.76
that voice when I was 17 and when I was

1770.57 --> 1779.09
23 I think somewhere there maybe it was

1772.76 --> 1781.45
2005 25 I actually saw it with a crowd

1779.09 --> 1785.649
of people that were all watching and

1781.45 --> 1790.1200000000001
listening it's just incredible to then

1785.649 --> 1790.12
face him like that

1813.61 --> 1826.1699999999998
what no I haven't had a haircut in 28

1823.84 --> 1826.1699999999998
years

1830.37 --> 1838.77
yeah oh man

1836.43 --> 1841.0800000000002
I refuse to cut my hair even in school

1838.77 --> 1847.18
when it was officially the rules that as

1841.08 --> 1850.3799999999999
a boy you had to okay I just refused

1847.18 --> 1850.38
[Music]

1860.62 --> 1867.2199999999998
well I do sometimes when it gets extra

1863.71 --> 1868.81
fluffy just tip cut the tips off you

1867.22 --> 1870.3700000000001
know because they're broken and it's

1868.81 --> 1872.4099999999999
better for your hair if you do that

1870.37 --> 1875.6699999999998
every now and then that's all but I

1872.41 --> 1877.21
never cut it I never cut it in short in

1875.67 --> 1881.26
28 years

1877.21 --> 1883.83
I can barely imagine myself without long

1881.26 --> 1883.83
hair really

1889.29 --> 1894.21
and it has all kinds of advantages

1891.6 --> 1898.6499999999999
because I always like to put it up like

1894.21 --> 1901.8600000000001
this what if I have it loose it does

1898.65 --> 1905.25
kind of give an extra charm to it but if

1901.86 --> 1908.25
I do that often then my hair also gets

1905.25 --> 1913.37
more broken more quickly so I usually

1908.25 --> 1913.37
just keep it like this to conserve it

1927.2 --> 1936.2
oh okay well I'm Andy young I was almost

1933.44 --> 1939.23
gonna ask does anybody want to see that

1936.2 --> 1941.809
so yeah I do I sometimes let my hair

1939.23 --> 1945.23
down especially if I'm gonna sit on that

1941.809 --> 1947.6299999999999
chair because otherwise that a piece of

1945.23 --> 1950.929
elastic was which is pretty tight not up

1947.63 --> 1952.669
there or down there you see it'll

1950.929 --> 1954.23
constantly be pushing in the back of my

1952.669 --> 1958.19
head so I just yeah

1954.23 --> 1965.169
in the evening I usually do fine you

1958.19 --> 1974.3500000000001
know I'm not insecure my hair is fine

1965.169 --> 1989.51
it's just a bit thin so my ex loved it

1974.35 --> 1995.269
loosen it up I'm gonna leave it up there

1989.51 --> 2000.1299999999999
like it is roughly but yeah see it's not

1995.269 --> 2002.7
super long it's oh yeah I don't know

2000.13 --> 2002.7
what you call that

2007.46 --> 2013.42
I know Voynich that's why I don't do

2010.91 --> 2013.42
that a lot

2018.52 --> 2026.03
I did actually have a mullet for a while

2023.36 --> 2029.87
we all did in the 80s and then it

2026.03 --> 2036.07
proceeded to become long hair I had a

2029.87 --> 2039.7099999999998
mullet pretty young so did my nephews

2036.07 --> 2040.3999999999999
but yeah after 11 I just didn't cut it

2039.71 --> 2043.1000000000001
anymore

2040.4 --> 2045.5600000000002
and I like they asked like do you want

2043.1 --> 2048.74
to know I want long I don't want to go

2045.56 --> 2051.41
through that jail period again because

2048.74 --> 2054.62
when it's not long enough yeah it

2051.41 --> 2060.2
becomes my hair because it is kind of

2054.62 --> 2063.2599999999998
thin it can get kind of wacky this can

2060.2 --> 2067.48
get very in cooperative so I had to put

2063.26 --> 2067.48
gel in it when I was like 12 and [ __ ]

2068.11 --> 2082.4
chocolate you guys if you want to see a

2079.31 --> 2091.85
really silly metal video that video

2082.4 --> 2094.39
picture I'll show you one it's kind of

2091.85 --> 2094.39
terrible

2096.11 --> 2103.67
it wasn't 2006 it it's basically right

2099.62 --> 2106.79
when I started the transition in eating

2103.67 --> 2110.15
organic and I was literally basically

2106.79 --> 2112.7599999999998
hunting for women in the sense that like

2110.15 --> 2120.23
looking around and in this case I was at

2112.76 --> 2125.2700000000004
a grunt championship like a music thing

2120.23 --> 2127.97
and yeah there was this one chick that

2125.27 --> 2130.84
was taking part in it and she was really

2127.97 --> 2135.1299999999997
hot I thought so I was kind of like

2130.84 --> 2139.21
being a bit groupie ish ah here it is oh

2135.13 --> 2139.21
my god so terrible

2143.48 --> 2148.81
oh Jesus I'm not gonna show you that one

2147.17 --> 2156.02
right

2148.81 --> 2161.99
the that's not me like like I rarely act

2156.02 --> 2165.349
out on a photo I hate that but in this

2161.99 --> 2166.7599999999998
case I kind of did I know it's not

2165.349 --> 2168.56
that's special

2166.76 --> 2176.2400000000002
I might have shown it before it's just

2168.56 --> 2178.3289999999997
now right I don't even remember who this

2176.24 --> 2181.3289999999997
guy is I think he was a photographer

2178.329 --> 2181.329
anyway

2189.29 --> 2213.13
right yay so stupid 2006 hey wait your

2202.82 --> 2213.13
yeah beer well I was having a lot of fun

2213.19 --> 2218.18
it was a total medal crowd and the

2216.2 --> 2227.0
atmosphere was good and that's kind of

2218.18 --> 2231.74
what it was like yeah see and that's 13

2227.0 --> 2235.49
years ago okay I'll show thee the

2231.74 --> 2238.1899999999996
terrible silly photo as well it's too

2235.49 --> 2239.8999999999996
bad for the girl I don't know if you

2238.19 --> 2247.4900000000002
would care I don't know who that is

2239.9 --> 2249.32
it's she did that then if she has a I

2247.49 --> 2252.7999999999997
don't know it is if she has a lot of

2249.32 --> 2255.32
trouble with it then then she probably

2252.8 --> 2258.4100000000003
wouldn't have done that there's no

2255.32 --> 2261.56
nudity or anything don't worry she

2258.41 --> 2263.68
didn't have to find it back again damn

2261.56 --> 2263.68
it

2267.109 --> 2276.859
right but I like the way I stood there a

2273.26 --> 2276.8590000000004
bit faint maybe

2288.27 --> 2291.45
all right

2291.99 --> 2299.7
yeah you know what I mean but yet it was

2297.45 --> 2300.4399999999996
all in good fun and this is what it

2299.7 --> 2304.0499999999997
looked like

2300.44 --> 2308.19
my arms were a little bit bigger because

2304.05 --> 2313.4100000000003
I was enjoying plenty of wealth and

2308.19 --> 2315.4700000000003
working out on my own and this is just a

2313.41 --> 2325.3199999999997
couple of years before I met my ex

2315.47 --> 2329.31
anyway enough about that that was damn

2325.32 --> 2332.52
I'm sweating make me nervous like I

2329.31 --> 2334.5299999999997
remember how to what level an idiot I

2332.52 --> 2336.66
used to be back then and I'm like afraid

2334.53 --> 2339.7200000000003
that you'll see it but of course you're

2336.66 --> 2342.0
not the literally gonna see it because

2339.72 --> 2344.8199999999997
I'm the only one that can see that

2342.0 --> 2349.29
because I've been through that and it's

2344.82 --> 2352.17
very hard to even take notice this is

2349.29 --> 2354.84
actually no it's because my hair is

2352.17 --> 2356.94
loose it's so much warmer there's all

2354.84 --> 2363.48
this warmth building up in between my

2356.94 --> 2369.5
hair just continues I have to take off

2363.48 --> 2369.5
my t-shirt as well just kidding

2373.68 --> 2377.7
it's not hot enough for that

2388.369 --> 2391.369
brennick

2391.92 --> 2395.099
[Music]

2396.26 --> 2407.17
hmm oh yeah yeah dreadlocks no never

2402.14 --> 2407.17
gonna do that destroys your hair

2413.479 --> 2420.859
chuckling are you Asian you don't know

2417.599 --> 2420.8590000000004
how funny that question is

2441.569 --> 2448.599
No yeah you know I thought about like oh

2445.75 --> 2451.059
yeah do a head banging but new let's not

2448.599 --> 2452.799
do that because I actually at this time

2451.059 --> 2456.46
for some reason maybe it's because of

2452.799 --> 2460.569
the these the abrupt weather change the

2456.46 --> 2464.619
moist just my muscles seem to be a

2460.569 --> 2466.93
little bit cramped up especially near my

2464.619 --> 2469.539
neck so if I'm gonna like be idiotic

2466.93 --> 2472.839
enough to do some head banging even if

2469.539 --> 2476.2000000000003
just for a few seconds I risk basically

2472.839 --> 2478.42
ripping something and then I'm like

2476.2 --> 2481.5099999999998
screwed for at least two weeks so not

2478.42 --> 2485.349
gonna do that I know myself I know how

2481.51 --> 2489.6090000000004
my body functions I know when to do and

2485.349 --> 2493.9
what not to do and that way I can get

2489.609 --> 2497.92
old pretty undamaged I think so just

2493.9 --> 2501.75
don't do anything foolish oh I have to

2497.92 --> 2501.75
do this because it's so hot

2505.25 --> 2535.02
ha oh that went pretty well without any

2509.46 --> 2536.67
assistance yeah yeah if I want to go

2535.02 --> 2538.89
full in then I have to do some like

2536.67 --> 2549.359
upper body training and then just sit

2538.89 --> 2556.2
here naked eating fruits that that'll do

2549.359 --> 2561.15
great probably be healthy to do that but

2556.2 --> 2564.1499999999996
I don't know I think it's probably just

2561.15 --> 2565.5
gonna distract people more than it's

2564.15 --> 2570.38
actually going to help them pay

2565.5 --> 2570.38
attention to what I typically talk about

2573.829 --> 2577.01
all right

2579.63 --> 2586.84
yeah yeah and you know what let's get

2583.03 --> 2589.0
back on the hair right because I Marwan

2586.84 --> 2591.34
and I always have to drag things out

2589.0 --> 2593.68
that people are pretty satisfied about

2591.34 --> 2596.44
not dragging out because I am just this

2593.68 --> 2597.97
neurotic information digger if and when

2596.44 --> 2600.1
it's probably not the best time for it

2597.97 --> 2602.2
but concerning the hair yeah I do get

2600.1 --> 2605.2599999999998
these troll remarks sometimes like oh oh

2602.2 --> 2608.23
in this building or its building because

2605.26 --> 2611.01
sometimes yeah this this shows yeah you

2608.23 --> 2615.55
know what that is that is just having

2611.01 --> 2617.71
thin hair because that's just what my

2615.55 --> 2625.63
freakin hair is like and guess what it's

2617.71 --> 2626.44
been exactly like this for at least damn

2625.63 --> 2630.7000000000003
I'm old

2626.44 --> 2637.66
yeah for like 17 years it hasn't changed

2630.7 --> 2640.93
in those 17 years really so yeah I'm not

2637.66 --> 2645.27
I'm not bullying it's I have slightly

2640.93 --> 2649.6
less hair here but that's the natural ie

2645.27 --> 2654.45
that became kind of a parent I guess in

2649.6 --> 2661.0899999999997
my early 20s but that's probably because

2654.45 --> 2665.3799999999997
I don't know my hair became a little bit

2661.09 --> 2667.03
thinner like after my teens were over

2665.38 --> 2669.52
for some reason I had a bit thicker

2667.03 --> 2673.1800000000003
maybe it is because I was using more

2669.52 --> 2675.88
artificial hair thicker thingies when I

2673.18 --> 2677.35
was young because I inherited thin air

2675.88 --> 2682.12
from my mother she had the same kind of

2677.35 --> 2685.5899999999997
issues and it just became apparent

2682.12 --> 2691.45
because I stopped using junk products

2685.59 --> 2694.9
and I don't do that anymore and it's

2691.45 --> 2698.97
been in great condition and very stable

2694.9 --> 2704.02
without any extra hair loss or anything

2698.97 --> 2708.49
so yeah I feel young

2704.02 --> 2719.8
I kind of look yeah I am very satisfied

2708.49 --> 2722.859
with with my with this physical body I'm

2719.8 --> 2727.3300000000004
very thankful to the Lord for giving it

2722.859 --> 2733.65
to me and I hope to make up for some of

2727.33 --> 2733.65
my foolish mistakes when I was young all

2733.98 --> 2738.839
[Music]

2735.839 --> 2738.839
right

2738.99 --> 2747.64
yeah brandy Oh with you I don't know it

2743.92 --> 2751.54
just you know with some men it just kind

2747.64 --> 2755.95
of suits them that's weird

2751.54 --> 2758.109
just some people it's like yeah it like

2755.95 --> 2760.5989999999997
looks cool or something I don't know it

2758.109 --> 2763.2999999999997
being bullish doesn't always make you

2760.599 --> 2767.77
look like ooh I don't think that at all

2763.3 --> 2772.38
it just depends on on your type I guess

2767.77 --> 2775.66
and also what it means to you if you are

2772.38 --> 2780.15
uncomfortable about it for real then

2775.66 --> 2780.1499999999996
that will influence you a great deal

2784.56 --> 2792.94
so my best advice is to just get over it

2789.39 --> 2795.12
because people are gonna basically abuse

2792.94 --> 2799.6
any weakness you're gonna have anyway

2795.12 --> 2802.12
so the best way is to just no longer let

2799.6 --> 2804.67
it bother you and embrace what you are

2802.12 --> 2808.5
and just think what you can kind of like

2804.67 --> 2812.26
still get out of it with it no it's

2808.5 --> 2814.03
and besides weirdly enough there are

2812.26 --> 2818.92
apparently chicks out there that really

2814.03 --> 2823.75
dig it I actually heard women say that

2818.92 --> 2825.4300000000003
and not like to like move on to some kid

2823.75 --> 2828.22
now today were just talking about it

2825.43 --> 2831.43
among them among girls and I was just

2828.22 --> 2833.14
listening in because I have ears and I

2831.43 --> 2834.6699999999996
was not standing too far away and it

2833.14 --> 2838.48
just happened to catch that that kind of

2834.67 --> 2841.3
thing and yeah girls sometimes like that

2838.48 --> 2844.48
so you don't have to be embarrassed if

2841.3 --> 2848.79
you're actually building at all you know

2844.48 --> 2850.96
it's even considered in a more

2848.79 --> 2852.4
physiological sense that if you are

2850.96 --> 2854.5
balding that means you have more

2852.4 --> 2856.4500000000003
testosterone that means kind of more

2854.5 --> 2859.14
fertility so it's all a matter of how

2856.45 --> 2859.14
you look at it

2869.42 --> 2872.32
all right

2874.13 --> 2876.88
mm-hmm

2882.53 --> 2889.61
all right well it is it is all a matter

2886.61 --> 2894.01
of perspective like I just said if you

2889.61 --> 2897.46
just consider that people that get moldy

2894.01 --> 2900.6200000000003
often that that is triggered by

2897.46 --> 2904.01
testosterone that it's can actually be

2900.62 --> 2908.72
taken as a good sign for fertility just

2904.01 --> 2909.5600000000004
like hey a person gets gray hair when

2908.72 --> 2911.5099999999998
they get older

2909.56 --> 2914.09
and it's like oh they're becoming old

2911.51 --> 2917.48
and weak they're useless now yeah yeah

2914.09 --> 2921.55
sure or you could see weights that

2917.48 --> 2924.56
person has went through some things and

2921.55 --> 2926.36
they probably have wisdom and you can

2924.56 --> 2929.21
recognize it whether white hair as it

2926.36 --> 2931.1
were although they might have issues

2929.21 --> 2934.31
with that on top of it you have to dig

2931.1 --> 2936.71
through and then suddenly the age is no

2934.31 --> 2940.91
longer really a downside there's always

2936.71 --> 2943.25
something positive you basically can get

2940.91 --> 2946.75
or at least try to get out of everything

2943.25 --> 2946.75
out of every type of thing

2950.91 --> 2957.0699999999997
and that's kind of now I feel bit to

2954.73 --> 2959.62
face saying that because it's like me

2957.07 --> 2962.11
like yeah I'm telling people don't worry

2959.62 --> 2964.2999999999997
about being bald when I'm obviously not

2962.11 --> 2966.4300000000003
bald and telling people oh don't worry

2964.3 --> 2971.6200000000003
about gray hair or looking old when I

2966.43 --> 2974.02
look insanely young fry heads but I do

2971.62 --> 2976.9
think that's really good advice like I

2974.02 --> 2980.46
heard other people give that advice as

2976.9 --> 2980.46
well and I kind of agreed on it so

2982.14 --> 3003.21
anyway yep and there's been people like

3000.42 --> 3006.03
face to face people that are even knew

3003.21 --> 3008.4
that kind of even told me like oh why

3006.03 --> 3010.2000000000003
don't you just shave it because you are

3008.4 --> 3015.71
seeing like these things

3010.2 --> 3018.99
and I'm like it what why would I do that

3015.71 --> 3027.2400000000002
it's my senses why did woman what I want

3018.99 --> 3030.39
to get rid of that ever just because I

3027.24 --> 3033.7799999999997
might look something that could be

3030.39 --> 3038.46
considered by some people as negative on

3033.78 --> 3043.44
my looks and besides I think I'm I got

3038.46 --> 3045.3
it down pretty well hey and if I really

3043.44 --> 3053.51
need to make a move usually it's just

3045.3 --> 3053.51
gonna be a blur weird

3053.97 --> 3057.14
but yeah

3062.03 --> 3069.27
huh well toady it's funny but yeah that

3066.39 --> 3072.15
story originally was what inspired me to

3069.27 --> 3075.89
keep my hair it that I learned that

3072.15 --> 3081.39
mythology I learned Greek mythology

3075.89 --> 3085.2
throughout my my late pre teens to early

3081.39 --> 3086.85
teens it was in that school it was when

3085.2 --> 3089.87
I started to grow long hair and I like

3086.85 --> 3092.3399999999997
that story it was also I was also told

3089.87 --> 3095.31
Greek mythology by my parents who were

3092.34 --> 3098.8500000000004
also I happened to talk about it and I

3095.31 --> 3102.18
liked it and I was like yeah I can do

3098.85 --> 3106.92
that I will be strong by having long

3102.18 --> 3110.21
hair because everybody with short hair

3106.92 --> 3113.4
seemed to me like they were acting basic

3110.21 --> 3114.96
so I was thought man I'll just go with

3113.4 --> 3117.32
the more sophisticated people

3114.96 --> 3120.66
and now retrospect a lot of those

3117.32 --> 3123.3900000000003
sophisticated people turn out to be kind

3120.66 --> 3127.91
of weirdos that are following cults now

3123.39 --> 3132.72
or basically created those cults but

3127.91 --> 3134.0299999999997
capacity was they they did have a lot of

3132.72 --> 3139.41
potential

3134.03 --> 3144.9300000000003
they just wasted it on their appetite

3139.41 --> 3149.33
for power most of them and the rest got

3144.93 --> 3149.33
shoved to the side I guess

3158.58 --> 3163.08
but yeah I got long hair and I'd like to

3161.13 --> 3166.59
keep it that way I'm satisfied it's

3163.08 --> 3168.69
always been just my hair color I like it

3166.59 --> 3173.1600000000003
I like that it is kind of like dark

3168.69 --> 3177.9
colored not perfectly black my dad's

3173.16 --> 3187.74
hair is almost perfectly black and it's

3177.9 --> 3192.4500000000003
more like the afro type hair but no not

3187.74 --> 3194.5499999999997
me I seem to be perfect crossover

3192.45 --> 3197.0099999999998
between my mother and my dad because my

3194.55 --> 3203.5800000000004
mother had lighter hair like blonde a

3197.01 --> 3205.3500000000004
bit it's darker blonde but it was

3203.58 --> 3209.2799999999997
lighter than my hair color so I got

3205.35 --> 3213.0
right in between hashtag me festive

attention exploration of the material of

3268.17 --> 3273.09
quantum physics with assistance because

3270.09 --> 3275.6000000000004
if I had to do it all on my own I'd get

3273.09 --> 3278.88
a headache before I finish one page

3275.6 --> 3281.25
seriously so I can definitely use

3278.88 --> 3283.83
assistance at it but once I really get

3281.25 --> 3286.59
the grip that's when the magic is gonna

3283.83 --> 3289.5
happen it's already have seen some of it

3286.59 --> 3292.569
so I will be back tomorrow with flat

3289.5 --> 3294.099
earth early-bird number 248

3292.569 --> 3296.529
and I'm going to join the flattery

3294.099 --> 3298.119
debates right after this and very

3296.529 --> 3301.779
curious to see what they come up with

3298.119 --> 3307.9790000000003
concerning that partial moon eclipse so

3301.779 --> 3307.979
until the next video keep it flat

3308.48 --> 3338.559
