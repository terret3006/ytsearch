105.68 --> 111.799
bit because I feel that Nathan's going

to be very busy with this new

112.759 --> 116.079
server like

117.2 --> 123.399
yesterday hello Richard G first in chat

Raining very

137.12 --> 142.20000000000002
clouded it's not very pleasant

148.76 --> 153.319
outside all right

155.2 --> 160.83999999999997
so it is Friday the 5th of January

163.36 --> 166.36
2024

167.879 --> 174.0
uh right and yeah there will be plenty

171.519 --> 174.0
to talk

174.159 --> 178.07999999999998
about of course yeah yesterday the Flat

176.959 --> 180.92000000000002
Earth

178.08 --> 183.31900000000002
debates was really interesting with like

180.92 --> 187.159
the other

183.319 --> 191.2
server although it got Rassy as all hell

187.159 --> 194.04
so yeah the there's not a lot of like

191.2 --> 197.72
anti- rassing discipline on that server

194.04 --> 197.72
so it yeah it got really

199.319 --> 207.0
messy but it was really interesting

201.799 --> 207.0
yesterday like wits it gets it was on

207.29 --> 210.56
[Music]

208.68 --> 213.04000000000002
there

210.56 --> 216.48
you yeah I don't know if you if You'

213.04 --> 219.239
guys have seen it you've seen it Richard

216.48 --> 222.439
G but it was really

219.239 --> 225.519
interesting right and yeah the the after

222.439 --> 225.519
show just lasted

226.56 --> 232.36
forever I think the guys were still like

229.12 --> 235.84
doing stuff at

232.36 --> 235.84
9 9 in

238.68 --> 241.68
theing

243.36 --> 251.0
right

245.959 --> 253.76
also finished watching fool me once yeah

251.0 --> 253.76
it was pretty

254.12 --> 258.639
intense there's definitely a lot of

256.6 --> 261.47900000000004
spoilers I could give away so I'm just

258.639 --> 265.28000000000003
not going to really say much about it

261.479 --> 265.28
except that like it's really

268.6 --> 274.47900000000004
interesting

271.44 --> 278.08
and kind of messed up

274.479 --> 279.84
too right but it was a mystery so yeah

278.08 --> 283.96
and it was very mysterious and it

279.84 --> 286.4
definitely gave me a big

283.96 --> 290.56
twist at the

286.4 --> 295.79999999999995
end so it did actually accomplish

290.56 --> 295.8
that but uh anyway yeah it was

298.56 --> 301.56
interesting

301.639 --> 307.52
what else oh

303.96 --> 308.479
yeah right so the the loose piece of my

307.52 --> 311.84
too

308.479 --> 311.84
finally fell

312.28 --> 318.479
out so that was pretty quick and yeah I

315.52 --> 320.52
am an there's an Illuminati cant in the

318.479 --> 324.039
oven right

320.52 --> 324.039
now so that's

328.479 --> 331.479
done

332.28 --> 335.67999999999995
still takes some getting used

349.16 --> 353.16
to that's my

358.479 --> 361.479
Illuminati

363.24 --> 369.52
right so yeah how have your day

366.12 --> 372.0
been how was your day I mean how has

369.52 --> 372.0
your day

380.319 --> 385.52000000000004
been just looking around what's going

388.4 --> 391.4
on

419.24 --> 421.40000000000003
yeah

426.68 --> 432.24
H

428.599 --> 435.479
okay right yeah nothing really super not

432.24 --> 435.479
worthy that I just bumped

448.319 --> 451.319
into

457.44 --> 460.96
right whoa

475.44 --> 481.319
really fed is on another

478.319 --> 481.319
level

482.56 --> 488.639
yes yes Richard you

485.319 --> 491.47900000000004
definitely I mean I feel like I'm not

488.639 --> 494.0
even really good enough at this point

491.479 --> 497.039
like with the level of argumentation

494.0 --> 498.879
that Nathan is rolling out like I'm just

497.039 --> 502.84
going to be quite Frank like I can't

498.879 --> 502.84000000000003
keep even I I can't do

503.72 --> 510.47900000000004
that like I'm very glad that I'm capable

507.039 --> 513.64
of like following the details

510.479 --> 517.36
but I could never like roll that out

513.64 --> 520.1999999999999
exactly like that so

517.36 --> 524.0
precise and at exactly the right moment

520.2 --> 526.44
so like I yeah that's Way Beyond My

524.0 --> 531.399
Level besides I'm not even that

526.44 --> 531.399
interested in like debating that

534.399 --> 540.839
much I'm just much more interesting in

537.12 --> 542.6
just spitballing idea and like comparing

540.839 --> 545.36
it's like what do you think of this oh

542.6 --> 545.36
what do you think of

545.72 --> 552.32
this all this bickering

548.6 --> 556.519
just such a waste of time for

552.32 --> 559.2
me when I could like throw out really

556.519 --> 559.2
good ideas

560.76 --> 568.079
instead the other groups of Flur are

563.56 --> 568.079
behind yeah of course they are

568.12 --> 572.32
rich it's not really an opinion it's

570.64 --> 576.8389999999999
just the way it

572.32 --> 578.6800000000001
is right they just focus on oh people oh

576.839 --> 580.839
we just talk about it oh we see what

578.68 --> 582.7199999999999
happens and oh we try to pick up on good

580.839 --> 585.9590000000001
arguments

582.72 --> 588.0790000000001
but I mean Flat Earth the bat is just

585.959 --> 591.5189999999999
like rigorous

588.079 --> 594.7199999999999
training in a way because it's just so

591.519 --> 594.72
on the nose all the

595.079 --> 602.56
time it's really about training it and

599.399 --> 604.92
hey I get it I'm glad that I'm get that

602.56 --> 605.76
I get it and so that I'm like up to date

604.92 --> 608.64
with the

605.76 --> 610.519
arguments but like in a heated debate

608.64 --> 613.079
against somebody else it would be very

610.519 --> 616.72
hard for me to like put every detail

613.079 --> 616.7199999999999
right on the right spot every

619.12 --> 626.0
time it requires me to be somewhat calm

622.2 --> 626.0
to even like keep track of all this

628.04 --> 633.5999999999999
stuff

630.64 --> 638.8389999999999
so it's like Nathan is completely

633.6 --> 641.639
unfaced by getting adoms thrown at

638.839 --> 643.839
him or he'll point it out really but

641.639 --> 647.839
like he's technically not faced by it

643.839 --> 650.6800000000001
he'll just like respond in argument

647.839 --> 653.2790000000001
instead like for me that's very

650.68 --> 656.56
difficult to do

653.279 --> 659.16
that like I do not respond well to

656.56 --> 660.76
adoms I mean I'm not going to like if if

659.16 --> 664.519
I'd be in a debate I'm not going to like

660.76 --> 668.399
explode like that like a r wi or

664.519 --> 670.519
something but I'd probably say like yeah

668.399 --> 675.68
screw that I'm not going to continue

670.519 --> 675.68
this conversation so I just jump

677.639 --> 685.0790000000001
up I'd quit before it became a rage

682.24 --> 687.9590000000001
quit because I that would definitely

685.079 --> 690.959
come then somebody just decides to start

687.959 --> 690.959
ad homing

693.0 --> 697.2
unless I felt really confident it

695.12 --> 699.8
basically just start an homing back I

697.2 --> 701.72
mean I am very good at ad homing when I

699.8 --> 705.959
feel like

701.72 --> 708.72
it when I when I get into that

705.959 --> 712.2399999999999
Spirit you all know that I'm pretty good

708.72 --> 712.24
at putting words

713.0 --> 717.959
together describing people's

715.68 --> 720.3599999999999
idiocy and

717.959 --> 722.1999999999999
flaws

720.36 --> 724.5600000000001
but I mean there would be no more debate

722.2 --> 724.5600000000001
after

726.88 --> 732.12
that that just be ad homing and just

729.92 --> 734.68
ramming you into the ground and like oh

732.12 --> 737.6
oh you're complaining oh let

734.68 --> 739.88
me let me then double down on that like

737.6 --> 742.32
just keep stomping it into the ground

739.88 --> 745.04
with the heels until it's like all just

742.32 --> 747.88
in the ground that's what I keep doing

745.04 --> 749.8
it would not look good it would not feel

747.88 --> 752.519
good

749.8 --> 755.399
but I'd have the temporary sensation

752.519 --> 757.12
like I basically kill them which is kind

755.399 --> 760.36
of what I want to

757.12 --> 763.839
do cuz people that at home in

760.36 --> 767.5600000000001
conversations and discussions I tend to

763.839 --> 767.5600000000001
like Savage hate

774.68 --> 783.279
them

777.24 --> 783.279
right hello Jog and wrath let see

806.68 --> 811.12

811.12 --> 814.639

867.16 --> 870.68
way thank

872.399 --> 878.279
It's Kind crowded in

875.279 --> 878.279
here

886.0 --> 889.0
oops

893.959 --> 899.04
right so guys anything interesting out

897.279 --> 901.399
there happening that I should be made

899.04 --> 901.399
aware

927.6 --> 930.6
of

936.079 --> 940.0
right so

937.36 --> 942.0
guys what do you want me to talk about

940.0 --> 945.199
I'm pretty

942.0 --> 947.16
awake I'm good I'm stable I'm late

945.199 --> 950.04
there's short there's a short amount of

947.16 --> 952.36
time but hey you want me to talk about

950.04 --> 954.24
it say it just roll it in there oh you

952.36 --> 957.6
want me some video I've never heard of

954.24 --> 959.24
before just share it whatever

957.6 --> 961.88
man

959.24 --> 965.36
just whatever you do just don't do

961.88 --> 966.88
nothing in my chat don't just say hello

965.36 --> 969.88
and then say

966.88 --> 969.88
nothing

974.24 --> 979.9590000000001
please oh Fox News ban fif yeah

981.0 --> 987.0
surely he's getting kind of

984.279 --> 989.8
popular and I have to say like for the

987.0 --> 991.92
game that it is what he's doing out

989.8 --> 995.7199999999999
there the politics and stuff I think

991.92 --> 1001.279
he's doing pretty good I'll just say

995.72 --> 1005.839
it I mean he still FC the snake to me

1001.279 --> 1005.8389999999999
because of what I know through Dr

1006.279 --> 1012.279
Shiva but I mean you got to give credit

1010.12 --> 1015.199
where credit is due and his performance

1012.279 --> 1018.16
has been like

1015.199 --> 1021.0
improving I already pointed that out a

1018.16 --> 1024.0
while ago is like hm I'm kind of liking

1021.0 --> 1026.559
this guy like I know he's like prob he

1024.0 --> 1027.28
is a snake probably underneath it but

1026.559 --> 1032.079
like

1027.28 --> 1037.6399999999999
damn he's he is like putting himself out

1032.079 --> 1037.6399999999999
there he's very sharp indeed like he has

1041.439 --> 1047.72
skill but I

1043.839 --> 1050.0
mean that skill typically also comes

1047.72 --> 1053.2
with like this

1050.0 --> 1055.679
Dynamic nature where it's like really

1053.2 --> 1058.1200000000001
easy for somebody like that to just flip

1055.679 --> 1060.64
it around and like oh yeah now I'm doing

1058.12 --> 1065.76
exactly the opposite of what I always

1060.64 --> 1065.76
did that's the risk you know that's the

1066.44 --> 1073.6000000000001
risk and it's very real

1069.96 --> 1075.44
risk right not so obvious not so obvious

1073.6 --> 1077.08
establishments is what all they do is

1075.44 --> 1078.52
like oh we're opposing them and then

1077.08 --> 1081.4399999999998
what they get the power it's like oh no

1078.52 --> 1085.0
wait we are actually

1081.44 --> 1087.1200000000001
them oh and then it's like oh just how

1085.0 --> 1088.72
long can you take before like everybody

1087.12 --> 1093.28
hat

1088.72 --> 1093.28
you but by that time you already got the

1096.48 --> 1103.559
power but yeah he is doing good and

1100.24 --> 1104.72
we'll see what happens hey ter 306 good

1103.559 --> 1107.32
see

1104.72 --> 1110.32
you widen world

1107.32 --> 1110.32
no

1113.96 --> 1117.039
I mean if that's going to happen a

1115.36 --> 1121.799
second time I think that there is going

1117.039 --> 1125.1589999999999
to be like a a military

1121.799 --> 1127.6
thing I have actually seen it it's just

1125.159 --> 1127.6000000000001
so

1129.08 --> 1136.4399999999998
crazy like in my vision was very

1132.48 --> 1139.2
distinct like early stage thing so not

1136.44 --> 1142.039
like when not like look got lost in the

1139.2 --> 1146.039
80 years of dwelling no in the very

1142.039 --> 1149.6
early like succinct Vision segments like

1146.039 --> 1152.8799999999999
a message from the outside like there

1149.6 --> 1152.8799999999999
was something like that going to

1157.84 --> 1163.6789999999999
happen or there was something in the

1160.159 --> 1166.7990000000002
plans as in there is a possibility to do

1163.679 --> 1166.799
that and it

1167.24 --> 1170.24
may

1172.679 --> 1176.52
there are liberals turning on by yeah

1174.36 --> 1180.52
that's I

1176.52 --> 1183.24
know he's absolutely unpopular and he's

1180.52 --> 1185.799
like going for Guin book of records of

1183.24 --> 1190.28
like the wor the

1185.799 --> 1193.9189999999999
worst national leader of all times or

1190.28 --> 1193.9189999999999
something he might make

1197.24 --> 1200.24
it

1210.28 --> 1215.6789999999999
hello Luke Kramers yeah happy New Year

1253.64 --> 1260.4
yeah just got here are you doing 45

1256.76 --> 1263.96
minute shows these days sort

1260.4 --> 1267.2
of I'm just like combination of like

1263.96 --> 1267.2
having rough nights

1267.679 --> 1271.039
and bad

1272.64 --> 1277.279
timing but I mean tomorrow I'll be

1278.08 --> 1285.96
there is it because of the

1280.88 --> 1285.96
cold may there's a lot of

1286.84 --> 1293.8799999999999
moist and there's like freaking water

1289.72 --> 1298.559
dripping in here that's why buckets over

1293.88 --> 1298.5590000000002
there so it is like that's

1308.64 --> 1315.8400000000001
annoying cold this Peri okay well it's

1312.48 --> 1317.039
not super Frosty cold it's just really

1315.84 --> 1322.48
freaking

1317.039 --> 1322.48
moist and gray and all that

1327.96 --> 1333.88
crap and I got bills I just got another

1330.919 --> 1337.44
bill basically proving to me like yeah

1333.88 --> 1340.0390000000002
yeah that financial situation thing that

1337.44 --> 1342.6000000000001
I was sort of like all fearful about

1340.039 --> 1344.76
half a year ago yeah it did get out of

1342.6 --> 1347.3999999999999
hand like right

1344.76 --> 1350.72
now there's a debt that's going to like

1347.4 --> 1354.1200000000001
explod ly grow and there's literally

1350.72 --> 1354.1200000000001
nothing I can do about

1362.08 --> 1366.1999999999998
it so that's that's

1366.72 --> 1371.84
sucks hey unless somebody could just

1369.039 --> 1373.52
like oh yeah could you like whip forth

1371.84 --> 1376.9599999999998
like

1373.52 --> 1379.96
500 that would be

1376.96 --> 1379.96
great

1384.6 --> 1389.32
right in the meantime I'm mostly

1386.24 --> 1393.84
concerned like about being able to

1389.32 --> 1399.6399999999999
eat on a weekly basis so there's

1393.84 --> 1399.6399999999999
literally nothing I can [ __ ] do about

1400.36 --> 1409.8799999999999
it and it sucks it makes this entire

1404.159 --> 1409.88
situation really [ __ ] suck

1410.52 --> 1416.679
also because there's literally not a

1413.159 --> 1418.0390000000002
[ __ ] thing I can do even if I step

1416.679 --> 1422.159
out of this

1418.039 --> 1425.84
scenario and like go try to figure out a

1422.159 --> 1429.44
job or whatever then I'm still not going

1425.84 --> 1429.4399999999998
to get out of

1436.88 --> 1439.88
it

1464.32 --> 1470.0
so yeah that's that don't generally like

1468.6 --> 1473.0
to dwell

1470.0 --> 1474.84
on disappointing things and all that

1473.0 --> 1478.44
that's why you don't typically want to

1474.84 --> 1482.52
bring it up but it really does suck a

1478.44 --> 1483.6000000000001
lot it's like a constant open wound it's

1482.52 --> 1487.279
right

1483.6 --> 1489.559
there there's nothing it can do about it

1487.279 --> 1491.32
can't just like show it off all the time

1489.559 --> 1494.2
it'll just hurt

1491.32 --> 1497.08
more and nobody's [ __ ] doing anything

1494.2 --> 1498.8400000000001
about it there's no super wealthy people

1497.08 --> 1501.24
out there that that are like yeah man

1498.84 --> 1504.6
this Arwin guy we really we want to keep

1501.24 --> 1504.6
him afloat

1505.279 --> 1511.84
no I'm very glad I have like friends

1508.84 --> 1515.0
here people like dank that are like

1511.84 --> 1517.84
capable of supporting me to a decent

1515.0 --> 1519.96
degree very happy about that feel very

1517.84 --> 1522.84
lucky wouldn't really know what the hell

1519.96 --> 1525.919
to do with my life if I

1522.84 --> 1528.6
hadn't but I'm coming to the realization

1525.919 --> 1532.76
yeah this is so great it's not [ __ ]

1528.6 --> 1532.76
enough isn't that just [ __ ]

1534.6 --> 1541.12
great so I'm going to have to like like

1538.88 --> 1544.279
sit on this edge

1541.12 --> 1546.4399999999998
here and until it splits me right down

1544.279 --> 1548.559
the middle at some point because it's

1546.44 --> 1551.44
just going to be too sharp for me to

1548.559 --> 1554.279
keep balance on it and then I'm going to

1551.44 --> 1555.6000000000001
die that's the [ __ ] situation I'm in

1554.279 --> 1559.2
here

1555.6 --> 1561.559
financially yeah

1559.2 --> 1564.88
I might one day actually land on the

1561.559 --> 1567.399
[ __ ] street because of this despite

1564.88 --> 1567.3990000000001
the [ __ ]

1569.32 --> 1574.1589999999999
weather yeah and then there will be no

1571.84 --> 1577.0
more [ __ ] early bird show I'll

1574.159 --> 1577.0
guarantee you

1581.52 --> 1588.76
that or Flat Earth debate or ever

1584.52 --> 1590.32
hearing from me ever again

1588.76 --> 1592.679
cuz I'm not going to be walking around

1590.32 --> 1592.6789999999999
with a

1613.919 --> 1619.88
smartphone but uh I don't know man maybe

1617.76 --> 1622.2
just this whole Flat Earth thing is just

1619.88 --> 1622.2
too

1623.0 --> 1630.399
much it's just that Flat Earth is been

1625.84 --> 1630.399
the only thing that actually gave me

1630.44 --> 1638.039
that that want the want to even be on

1634.88 --> 1641.24
media to do that because I have unique

1638.039 --> 1644.44
ideas with it that's why I want that's

1641.24 --> 1647.88
why I came on YouTube guys specifically

1644.44 --> 1649.88
because of that if I go like yeah but

1647.88 --> 1652.5200000000002
because of Flat Earth you don't get the

1649.88 --> 1656.0390000000002
numbers you don't get the the funds they

1652.52 --> 1657.44
don't throw giant piles of cash at you

1656.039 --> 1660.76
because you're

1657.44 --> 1663.919
not a [ __ ] scumbag like people out

1660.76 --> 1663.919
there that have that

1668.08 --> 1673.799
setup right so if I'd like just go on

1671.279 --> 1675.76
YouTube to talk about the current thing

1673.799 --> 1678.48
or about politics

1675.76 --> 1682.0
crap yeah I might have been like super

1678.48 --> 1685.279
rich and like absolutely

1682.0 --> 1688.279
evil not really giving a

1685.279 --> 1690.84
[ __ ] just like yeah give me more money

1688.279 --> 1692.84
just give me more money and die I I

1690.84 --> 1694.9599999999998
might have ended up like literally

1692.84 --> 1697.9189999999999
telling everybody to get the vaccine for

1694.96 --> 1700.64
real and I might even get paid for it no

1697.919 --> 1701.919
wouldn't get that far I'm just kind of

1700.64 --> 1704.64
sick of

1701.919 --> 1707.96
this like I want to talk about Flat

1704.64 --> 1709.72
Earth but because of that

1707.96 --> 1712.96
it's just that these [ __ ] Mega

1709.72 --> 1714.559
corporations have just decided like oh

1712.96 --> 1716.919
okay well that means that you're going

1714.559 --> 1719.559
to have a a PO a life of poverty and

1716.919 --> 1721.5590000000002
we're literally going to choke you down

1719.559 --> 1724.6399999999999
at every

1721.559 --> 1728.559
corner and and then pretend like we

1724.64 --> 1728.5590000000002
don't even do that it's all your

1728.84 --> 1732.9599999999998
fault I'm getting kind of sick of

1735.919 --> 1740.88
it right anyway I'm going to get my

1737.96 --> 1740.88
coffee be right

1766.32 --> 1769.32
back

1796.32 --> 1799.32
e

1804.84 --> 1810.1589999999999
oh and by the way I figured out that it

1807.279 --> 1810.159
wasn't really the

1811.36 --> 1817.6
coffee that's really mostly responsible

1814.32 --> 1822.1589999999999
for the the cramp thing it's sugar it's

1817.6 --> 1822.1589999999999
directly sugar that's what I

1826.24 --> 1829.24
noticed

1839.36 --> 1848.399
on GEOS with nather what what does that

1844.84 --> 1851.9599999999998
mean what the [ __ ] is

1848.399 --> 1851.9599999999998
GEOS what this

1856.24 --> 1861.48
boy not expressing your truth in the

1858.919 --> 1862.919
world would be far worse than death yeah

1861.48 --> 1865.919
but I mean

1862.919 --> 1865.919
death

1867.919 --> 1874.0
though it's just death it's just oh well

1871.88 --> 1876.279
you could have Death Or you could have

1874.0 --> 1878.559
death which one do you choose and this

1876.279 --> 1881.679
is the [ __ ] thing that I even saw my

1878.559 --> 1883.8799999999999
Visions very early and that was

1881.679 --> 1887.279
literally hell it's

1883.88 --> 1891.8400000000001
like you get to choose what you

1887.279 --> 1891.84
basically lose and you don't get

1892.24 --> 1898.1200000000001
anything which like when you're really

1895.32 --> 1901.0
young just thinking about that is like

1898.12 --> 1903.639
one of the worst [ __ ] things you can

1901.0 --> 1906.399
imagine that you just get to pit that

1903.639 --> 1910.9599999999998
you you get to sort of choose what you

1906.399 --> 1912.86
lose and you don't get anything for for

interesting when my Channel's very

2240.119 --> 2243.119
explosive

yeah it's not going to draw in more

2245.96 --> 2251.079
people like at best I just get Godzilla

it aren't there jobs available uh maybe

that are going to give like a pay that's

2320.16 --> 2328.3999999999996
going to even come close to me becoming

2324.4 --> 2331.4
capable of like financing my own

2328.4 --> 2331.4
Survival

2333.52 --> 2338.52
okay so no

2341.04 --> 2346.359
yeah I

2342.64 --> 2348.8799999999997
mean every time a person here says jobs

2346.359 --> 2351.88
available that means no more Flat Earth

2348.88 --> 2351.88
early bird show

2354.0 --> 2361.319
then like that's what that will always

2358.48 --> 2364.44
mean every time somebody brings up that

2361.319 --> 2366.52
question yeah like oh so you want me to

2364.44 --> 2369.44
quit the early bird show because that is

2366.52 --> 2374.079
going to happen the early bird show is

2369.44 --> 2377.28
in the time slot where all [ __ ] jobs

2374.079 --> 2379.92
in the world always want that time slot

2377.28 --> 2381.28
yeah all the jobs in the world all have

2379.92 --> 2384.6800000000003
this time

2381.28 --> 2386.6800000000003
slot so it's goodbye early bir show then

2384.68 --> 2391.16
just so you

2386.68 --> 2393.7999999999997
know what about evening jobs uh

2391.16 --> 2396.68
no that's going to make me nothing

2393.8 --> 2399.6800000000003
evening jobs that's not going to be a

2396.68 --> 2399.68
full-time job

2401.8 --> 2408.8
then and

2404.24 --> 2411.8799999999997
besides I'm not really all that optimal

2408.8 --> 2411.88
physically in the

2411.96 --> 2417.0
evening so

2414.72 --> 2421.04
no yeah how

2417.0 --> 2421.04
about stop wasting my

2422.319 --> 2428.119
time yeah I I mean I could probably do

2425.119 --> 2430.1600000000003
all of it under one [ __ ] condition

2428.119 --> 2433.76
and that's no more

2430.16 --> 2433.7599999999998
YouTube is that

2444.4 --> 2450.88
clear do a late bird

2447.28 --> 2453.8
show you mean a night owl show oh that's

2450.88 --> 2455.319
cute but it's not going to be a fun show

2453.8 --> 2458.319
for

2455.319 --> 2458.319
me

2459.4 --> 2464.48
because I'm in a worse condition I will

2462.4 --> 2467.04
look worse yeah because there's no

2464.48 --> 2467.04
natural

2468.359 --> 2475.56
daylight I'm not going to have as much

2470.839 --> 2478.44
fresh energy going to be less full of

2475.56 --> 2482.56
ideas but I mean if it's like

2478.44 --> 2484.92
specifically with somebody else on then

2482.56 --> 2488.0
yeah that could work if I had somebody

2484.92 --> 2489.92
else to like do my show with or have

2488.0 --> 2491.64
somebody on have people on with

2489.92 --> 2495.7200000000003
interviews hey you want to be

2491.64 --> 2498.56
interviewed by Arwin contact me I can do

2495.72 --> 2501.56
that I know it's very rare right there's

2498.56 --> 2504.04
a couple of them on my channel and my

2501.56 --> 2507.44
YouTube really lost to shove them

2504.04 --> 2509.92
forward it's like my own YouTube channel

2507.44 --> 2511.96
algorithm is like super sick of just

2509.92 --> 2514.2400000000002
seeing my face so they just like

2511.96 --> 2516.28
desperately as soon as they see another

2514.24 --> 2518.5989999999997
face on on the video they just like oh

2516.28 --> 2520.5600000000004
oh look there's another person on it too

2518.599 --> 2522.76
another person got on the early bir show

2520.56 --> 2525.04
Once like they're just terrified of

2522.76 --> 2528.48
everybody getting mind numbingly sick

2525.04 --> 2528.48
from seeing my face or

2531.079 --> 2538.3590000000004
something right but hey you want to get

2534.4 --> 2541.48
on with me and talk Flat Earth or

2538.359 --> 2543.72
something else asterics whatever you can

2541.48 --> 2547.16
do that contact

2543.72 --> 2550.1189999999997
me and it can be in the evening if it's

2547.16 --> 2554.0
like if in the middle of the super early

2550.119 --> 2556.4
morning is not good for you yeah you had

2554.0 --> 2558.88
to actually contact me

2556.4 --> 2562.319
though and not

2558.88 --> 2565.1600000000003
like never ever getting contacted by

2562.319 --> 2568.52
anybody like over the time span of like

2565.16 --> 2572.16
five years which is now the current

2568.52 --> 2574.839
situation like nobody has contacted me

2572.16 --> 2577.72
to get on with my show like

2574.839 --> 2580.96
ever except for starets and how did he

2577.72 --> 2583.9199999999996
do it in the chat he just say hey what

2580.96 --> 2588.16
can I get on with you oh yeah cool let's

2583.92 --> 2590.2400000000002
do it and then we did it like two times

2588.16 --> 2591.92
yeah that's the only person that has

2590.24 --> 2594.1189999999997
like ever done

2591.92 --> 2597.319
that like

2594.119 --> 2598.48
that anybody can do that you don't have

2597.319 --> 2601.16
to

2598.48 --> 2604.64
be you don't even have to have your own

2601.16 --> 2607.5589999999997
damn Channel like I don't [ __ ] care

2604.64 --> 2609.64
you want to have a conversation with Arn

2607.559 --> 2611.52
you want to ask me questions face to

2609.64 --> 2615.68
face where you can rumpus the [ __ ] out

2611.52 --> 2615.68
of me then you can do that

2617.16 --> 2624.5989999999997
here rasaad was on also yeah yeah yeah

2621.04 --> 2624.599
yeah that's a special case

2629.96 --> 2634.839
though I'm not having R to had back on

2635.079 --> 2638.079
though

2644.72 --> 2650.04
one of the first Early Bird shows I

2646.52 --> 2651.92
watch with say yeah well why is that the

2650.04 --> 2656.119
first one of the first ones you watched

2651.92 --> 2660.04
richy because that particular video gets

2656.119 --> 2663.28
shoved in your face like

2660.04 --> 2665.2799999999997
continually like on my page it's like oh

2663.28 --> 2668.2000000000003
the one with tasar Reds is on the front

2665.28 --> 2671.1600000000003
page again is it surprise surprise it's

2668.2 --> 2674.0789999999997
always on the [ __ ] front page for me

2671.16 --> 2676.5989999999997
for you every time I see that video it's

2674.079 --> 2678.559
like months I just always see that

2676.599 --> 2681.3590000000004
[ __ ] video

2678.559 --> 2684.28
1536 every freaking time it's always on

2681.359 --> 2686.16
the front page so it's not surprising

2684.28 --> 2688.079
that oh I got to know you through that

2686.16 --> 2691.0789999999997
video yeah because it's always on the

2688.079 --> 2691.079
front page for some

2692.4 --> 2697.64
reason and yeah by the way despite being

2695.68 --> 2700.68
on the the front page it still only has

2697.64 --> 2702.7599999999998
303 views or maybe they cut those views

2700.68 --> 2703.68
down dramatically or something they

2702.76 --> 2706.92
capped

2703.68 --> 2710.72
it but for it being always on the front

2706.92 --> 2710.7200000000003
page it doesn't have even that many

2714.0 --> 2719.96
views anyway I'm going to eat my kasan

2716.599 --> 2719.96
before it's completely cold

2724.88 --> 2727.88
cheers

2733.079 --> 2736.76
yeah by the way good to see you

2746.76 --> 2754.0400000000004
Robert show with me and Nathan was

2749.68 --> 2758.839
great sure well maybe I'll get Nathan on

2754.04 --> 2758.839
if he'll if he'll want to or have the

2760.18 --> 2764.72
[Music]

2761.72 --> 2764.72
time

2766.68 --> 2772.8799999999997
sure right but I mean you got to realize

2769.92 --> 2775.04
also that the time slot for the actual

2772.88 --> 2777.8
early bir show is just a difficult time

2775.04 --> 2780.319
slot for pretty much most people in the

2777.8 --> 2784.4
entire [ __ ]

2780.319 --> 2787.2799999999997
world so it's not easy I'm just saying

2784.4 --> 2789.319
that hey you want to see more people or

2787.28 --> 2792.44
you want to get on but the time slot's

2789.319 --> 2797.16
not right or you can contact me we can

2792.44 --> 2801.319
like do a live show or a recorded

2797.16 --> 2805.0789999999997
show in five or six hours from now just

2801.319 --> 2806.839
like that all you have to do is actually

2805.079 --> 2811.319
contact

2806.839 --> 2814.7999999999997
me and then we can arrange such a

2811.319 --> 2818.16
thing the condition is you have to have

2814.8 --> 2820.8
Skype you have to have

2818.16 --> 2823.44
Skype and you're going to have to be

2820.8 --> 2828.4
willing to contact me on Skype because

2823.44 --> 2828.4
that's how you're going to be on the

2844.72 --> 2847.72
show

2851.119 --> 2854.7200000000003
why did you ban me

2867.92 --> 2874.359
what a p per viiew braw what the hell

2871.8 --> 2874.3590000000004
does that even

2874.72 --> 2877.72
mean

2894.68 --> 2903.0789999999997
yeah I know Robert glow Buster crew

2899.079 --> 2903.079
definitely make flat Earth look

2903.28 --> 2911.3590000000004
ridiculous it's just their Des L trying

2906.68 --> 2914.839
to keep the attention of really dumb

2911.359 --> 2914.839
people that's the

2914.92 --> 2919.96
problem they want to scoop up the big

2917.64 --> 2923.1189999999997
crowd guess what you're going to have to

2919.96 --> 2925.079
mind control [ __ ] retards then cuz

2923.119 --> 2927.4
that's how that works you want the

2925.079 --> 2930.2000000000003
biggest crowd ever of all people that

2927.4 --> 2933.28
are like really behind well you got to

2930.2 --> 2936.48
have to convince them that you're

2933.28 --> 2939.48
God and if they're [ __ ] ret [ __ ]

2936.48 --> 2942.319
enough they will then follow you like

2939.48 --> 2945.88
that because they're [ __ ]

2942.319 --> 2948.48
[ __ ] right so you got to somehow

2945.88 --> 2951.319
mind control those [ __ ] retards into

2948.48 --> 2954.52
thinking that you're all the

2951.319 --> 2956.7599999999998
[ __ ] so that they'll like praise you and

2954.52 --> 2958.64
follow you around and throw money at you

2956.76 --> 2960.1600000000003
even though they literally don't

2958.64 --> 2961.24
understand a [ __ ] word that's coming

2960.16 --> 2964.0
out of your

2961.24 --> 2966.1189999999997
mouth that's what they want because hey

2964.0 --> 2969.96
the majority of the world is is getting

2966.119 --> 2971.92
filled with complete [ __ ]

2969.96 --> 2973.88
retards they're getting worse the

2971.92 --> 2976.079
youth's getting worse the newer

2973.88 --> 2979.44
generation of all these guys just like

2976.079 --> 2982.48
growing up they're all

2979.44 --> 2984.7200000000003
malformed intellectually and

2982.48 --> 2989.04
emotionally these people have all been

2984.72 --> 2991.64
like severely insanely traumatized in

2989.04 --> 2994.52
certain ways mentally when they were

2991.64 --> 2997.7599999999998
young all these people are all having

2994.52 --> 3001.52
issues with trying to figure out

2997.76 --> 3003.0400000000004
reality because of what has been done

3001.52 --> 3005.88
for decades

3003.04 --> 3008.88
now crazy programming on the kids

3005.88 --> 3011.0
through television School government

3008.88 --> 3016.359
[ __ ] whole Co

3011.0 --> 3019.2
crap people lose their

3016.359 --> 3023.24
minds but they still want to be part of

3019.2 --> 3026.4399999999996
something naturally right so

3023.24 --> 3030.2
then they just go to what they think is

3026.44 --> 3031.96
the biggest guy out there and it doesn't

3030.2 --> 3035.2799999999997
have to be smart they can barely keep

3031.96 --> 3037.4
track as long as it just sounds smart

3035.28 --> 3041.28
and

3037.4 --> 3041.28
confident and that's how that

3042.04 --> 3048.04
works right there a [ __ ]

3044.72 --> 3051.0789999999997
herder or sheep herder if you will

3048.04 --> 3054.68
there's a lot of those and they have

3051.079 --> 3056.3590000000004
money and they just throw it at you even

3054.68 --> 3058.3999999999996
though they don't understand the [ __ ]

3056.359 --> 3060.48
word you're saying because you sound

3058.4 --> 3062.92
smart and

3060.48 --> 3065.16
confident and they didn't hear anything

3062.92 --> 3067.64
that triggered them to like be super

3065.16 --> 3070.2799999999997
suspicious of you in some way because of

3067.64 --> 3070.2799999999997
some weird

3071.559 --> 3077.079
programming yeah CU all these people are

3074.0 --> 3078.88
just propelled by [ __ ] up programming

3077.079 --> 3080.48
that's out of their control they are not

3078.88 --> 3084.359
even aware of

3080.48 --> 3087.119
it personality is just shaped by the

3084.359 --> 3092.0789999999997
programming because they're too dumb to

3087.119 --> 3092.079
undo that and nobody else

3098.52 --> 3103.839
cares to beat the [ __ ] you must be

3101.119 --> 3106.599
able to think [ __ ] what it's very

3103.839 --> 3108.88
easy to think [ __ ] it's just a waste

3106.599 --> 3108.88
of

3109.44 --> 3117.04
time what I want is retardation to be

3113.28 --> 3118.6400000000003
savagely discouraged

3117.04 --> 3123.16
instead

3118.64 --> 3125.44
of encouraged to to exploit them

3123.16 --> 3129.0789999999997
financially yeah cuz that's what's been

3125.44 --> 3135.0
happening that's what's the idiocracy

3129.079 --> 3139.7200000000003
process it's like oh if we just dumb it

3135.0 --> 3143.48
down we can reach a wider audience

3139.72 --> 3146.4399999999996
yeah yeah when that sentence was first

3143.48 --> 3149.76
uttered it's probably like in the 60s or

3146.44 --> 3151.599
something in me like that's when all of

3149.76 --> 3154.6800000000003
this [ __ ] went to

3151.599 --> 3157.92
hell that's when it

3154.68 --> 3161.72
started that's when everything became so

3157.92 --> 3164.48
[ __ ] dumb why because you could have

3161.72 --> 3164.48
a bigger

3164.68 --> 3169.72
audience yeah more [ __ ] well guess

3167.44 --> 3171.799
what if you're just radiating more

3169.72 --> 3175.52
retardation out

3171.799 --> 3178.079
there it's going to make everybody even

3175.52 --> 3180.52
more stupid and that's what's been

3178.079 --> 3182.96
happening generation on

3180.52 --> 3188.72
generation and now the new generation of

3182.96 --> 3192.28
whiz kid is like maybe a tenth of the

3188.72 --> 3193.2
smarts of like the real computer nerd

3192.28 --> 3197.8390000000004
from the

3193.2 --> 3201.24
80s yeah those guys in the 80s were like

3197.839 --> 3204.16
literally 10 times as quick and smart as

3201.24 --> 3205.9199999999996
any supposed Genius of

3204.16 --> 3208.0
now

3205.92 --> 3209.839
because they actually had to do it all

3208.0 --> 3211.599
they had to actually figure it out in

3209.839 --> 3214.48
person they couldn't just look something

3211.599 --> 3216.92
up they couldn't just ask Jack GTP to do

3214.48 --> 3220.359
it for them

3216.92 --> 3222.4
yeah actually smart people that actually

3220.359 --> 3224.7599999999998
understand things these newer

3222.4 --> 3228.4
Generations smart

3224.76 --> 3231.28
people they're [ __ ]

3228.4 --> 3233.96
[ __ ] they they can like construct a

3231.28 --> 3236.1600000000003
sentence to sound halfway competent and

3233.96 --> 3239.359
they think they're brilliant

3236.16 --> 3242.7599999999998
no you're not you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3239.359 --> 3242.7599999999998
you've been programmed to be a

3248.24 --> 3254.359
[ __ ] it needs to

3251.04 --> 3258.88
stop this whole [ __ ] advertising to

3254.359 --> 3261.799
the most [ __ ] person ever needs to

3258.88 --> 3264.079
stop because it's making it's creating

3261.799 --> 3265.7599999999998
the idiocracy it needs to

3264.079 --> 3268.2000000000003
stop

3265.76 --> 3270.88
like and in order for that such a thing

3268.2 --> 3272.799
to stop that that like that needs to be

3270.88 --> 3276.799
by government government needs to say

3272.799 --> 3280.28
like standards like media like you're

3276.799 --> 3283.0
not allowed to do that anymore here's

3280.28 --> 3284.7200000000003
the statistical result it's scientific

3283.0 --> 3288.2
that that's the statistical result

3284.72 --> 3292.16
you're not allowed to do that anymore or

3288.2 --> 3292.96
you get fines of like millions and then

3292.16 --> 3295.72
if

3292.96 --> 3298.559
you keep doing it

3295.72 --> 3302.04
billions and then we just confiscate the

3298.559 --> 3305.599
entire media Corporation by the

3302.04 --> 3308.4
state if you keep doing it that's what

3305.599 --> 3310.96
should be happening that's the only way

3308.4 --> 3313.2000000000003
you can actually stop like the Cascade

3310.96 --> 3313.2
of

3314.64 --> 3322.5589999999997
Idiocracy yeah no longer encourage

3318.96 --> 3325.359
stupidity or sloth or fatness or

3322.559 --> 3327.799
anything like that gluttony right all

3325.359 --> 3330.92
these cash cows all these sinful cash

3327.799 --> 3333.559
cows to zombie corporations right they

3330.92 --> 3335.88
just want to make money well the best

3333.559 --> 3339.3190000000004
way to make money is to make to turn a

3335.88 --> 3341.76
person into a disgusting demon blob that

3339.319 --> 3345.119
just continually needs to consume and

3341.76 --> 3348.3590000000004
waste yeah because they waste the most

3345.119 --> 3351.2400000000002
money on corporations that provide them

3348.359 --> 3353.799
[ __ ] for their sin yeah so that's what

3351.24 --> 3356.64
they do then that's what the [ __ ]

3353.799 --> 3361.52
corporations do then then until you say

3356.64 --> 3365.64
you're not allowed to do that

3361.52 --> 3365.64
anymore yeah that's how it

3373.52 --> 3379.7599999999998
works right but of course the powers

3377.16 --> 3382.799
that be currently and the mega

3379.76 --> 3386.44
corporations are in power so instead

3382.799 --> 3388.92
they dictate what the politicians do and

3386.44 --> 3390.7200000000003
you can't have a political opinion

3388.92 --> 3394.44
that's against the current thing or the

3390.72 --> 3394.4399999999996
the main group

3401.599 --> 3409.319
right so what's actually happening

3404.96 --> 3411.92
is exactly the opposite of what we

3409.319 --> 3415.599
should be doing that's what's happening

3411.92 --> 3418.64
exactly the opposite government should

3415.599 --> 3422.1600000000003
be cracking down on corporations and

3418.64 --> 3424.359
media telling them you can't do these

3422.16 --> 3425.72
things this is bad for the public here's

3424.359 --> 3428.16
the scientific

3425.72 --> 3429.0789999999997
evidence here's the study from the last

3428.16 --> 3431.2799999999997
100

3429.079 --> 3433.599
years

3431.28 --> 3438.6400000000003
yeah instead

3433.599 --> 3439.839
no Corporation heads and their policies

3438.64 --> 3442.16
are

3439.839 --> 3446.2
like

3442.16 --> 3447.5989999999997
manipulating and rousing up audiences

3446.2 --> 3450.5989999999997
against

3447.599 --> 3453.92
politicians that could be a threat to

3450.599 --> 3459.119
their Monopoly power that's what's

3453.92 --> 3459.119
really happening in the west Now isn't

3473.799 --> 3476.799
it

3482.76 --> 3486.76
yeah Richard yeah but yeah that formula

3485.76 --> 3491.28
is

3486.76 --> 3491.28
just it's missing some things

3491.4 --> 3499.2000000000003
yeah because idiocy has to actually be

3496.319 --> 3503.0
fed I don't think idiocy is even a

3499.2 --> 3505.68
natural state idiocy only really exists

3503.0 --> 3509.599
because of continual poison

3505.68 --> 3512.7599999999998
so if somebody like keeps eating paint

3509.599 --> 3514.92
chips or lead or something right yeah

3512.76 --> 3516.6800000000003
then they stay stupid it's going to do

3514.92 --> 3519.52
eventually do damage that cannot be on

3516.68 --> 3522.96
them but they have to keep doing it and

3519.52 --> 3525.0389999999998
so even idiots and idiot families

3522.96 --> 3527.88
they're going to spawn forth

3525.039 --> 3530.8390000000004
matildas so unless every one of them

3527.88 --> 3533.1600000000003
keeps being indoctrinated thoroughly

3530.839 --> 3533.16
with

3533.2 --> 3537.5989999999997
retardation there will literally be

3535.319 --> 3540.0
Matilda's rising up for them and just

3537.599 --> 3541.88
like retaining their Brilliance and it's

3540.0 --> 3543.2
like oh stupid family oh suddenly

3541.88 --> 3546.1600000000003
they're smart again because there's

3543.2 --> 3549.0
brilliant people in there now we have to

3546.16 --> 3550.92
keep them [ __ ] you have to actively

3549.0 --> 3553.0
dumb down the smart people that are

3550.92 --> 3556.16
going to pop up in these new

3553.0 --> 3560.64
families that's what's happening cuz

3556.16 --> 3563.64
matildas will rise I'm one of those in a

3560.64 --> 3566.64
way and my life kind of got [ __ ]

3563.64 --> 3566.64
up

3567.64 --> 3572.7599999999998
yeah but I am

3569.68 --> 3575.0789999999997
like in ways

3572.76 --> 3577.3590000000004
smarter than my parents and they were

3575.079 --> 3579.92
not dumb definitely my mother was not

3577.359 --> 3581.119
dumb but they were all like [ __ ] in

3579.92 --> 3584.48
ways they were

3581.119 --> 3586.7200000000003
all emotionally incompetent my dad's

3584.48 --> 3589.28
really overcome that but like when I was

3586.72 --> 3591.9199999999996
younger they were like emotionally

3589.28 --> 3594.76
incompetent and thereby also socially

3591.92 --> 3599.119
incompetent like we as a family didn't

3594.76 --> 3601.5200000000004
know how to compose ourselves as a group

3599.119 --> 3606.1600000000003
versus other families or the outside

3601.52 --> 3606.16
world we didn't know how to it was a

3610.48 --> 3616.28
mess and that messiness like other

3613.839 --> 3619.2799999999997
people played into that manipulate they

3616.28 --> 3619.28
manipulated

3623.559 --> 3628.76
me

3626.24 --> 3631.8799999999997
with it I was kind of vulnerable it

3628.76 --> 3635.599
didn't really they didn't take they

3631.88 --> 3639.52
didn't make me do anything terrible on

3635.599 --> 3642.2000000000003
purpose but I really there was a period

3639.52 --> 3645.599
there where I really hat it my parents

3642.2 --> 3649.0789999999997
like really hat it it's like they just

3645.599 --> 3653.4
die and be out of my way it got to that

3649.079 --> 3653.4
point and my mother did actually

3653.52 --> 3660.16
die that's really creepy a

3657.799 --> 3661.799
realization it's almost like I wished it

3660.16 --> 3664.0
and then it happened and then I feel

3661.799 --> 3666.96
like what the [ __ ] did that really

3664.0 --> 3666.96
happen

3670.72 --> 3675.5989999999997
yeah right but the problem is

3673.039 --> 3678.28
programming and stupid

3675.599 --> 3680.92
programming keeps people stupid if you

3678.28 --> 3682.8390000000004
take the stupid programming away they'll

3680.92 --> 3686.2400000000002
start to figure they'll be left to their

3682.839 --> 3690.799
own devices in pulses will suddenly feel

3686.24 --> 3694.52
room to come forth and Brilliance will

3690.799 --> 3697.0
automatically as per design of God

3694.52 --> 3698.52
return like the Matilda effect that's

3697.0 --> 3701.119
what I'm going to call

3698.52 --> 3703.7599999999998
it I'm going to actually put that in the

3701.119 --> 3704.7200000000003
title it because it is an effect it's a

3703.76 --> 3707.2400000000002
real

3704.72 --> 3709.0389999999998
thing now they exaggerated it a little

3707.24 --> 3712.359
bit by like giving her telekinesis and

3709.039 --> 3715.96
all that but that thing of a brilliant

3712.359 --> 3719.119
person like being born among retards is

3715.96 --> 3719.119
very very

3719.68 --> 3725.0789999999997
real and usually they they don't make

3722.72 --> 3726.9599999999996
out of it they just get so damaged by

3725.079 --> 3728.92
their parents that are all jealous that

3726.96 --> 3731.2
they eventually become like emotionally

3728.92 --> 3731.92
crippled which then gets in the way of

3731.2 --> 3734.52
their

3731.92 --> 3737.16
intelligence they just become spastics

3734.52 --> 3740.599
or like Globe tards or something

3737.16 --> 3740.5989999999997
hopelessly in love with

3743.359 --> 3746.359
delusions

3750.39 --> 3753.46
[Applause]

3760.92 --> 3764.599
oo this is a good

3768.44 --> 3774.039
title continual idiocracy media

3771.839 --> 3775.92
programming to counter the Matilda

3774.039 --> 3778.4
effect

3775.92 --> 3778.4
I like

3785.52 --> 3792.839
that idiot person not involved in public

3788.839 --> 3792.839
affairs Layman that's hilarious

3794.119 --> 3800.079
really

3796.279 --> 3802.44
tomonoid wow that's a very different way

3800.079 --> 3805.079
to look at that

3802.44 --> 3807.2400000000002
word so they think that

3805.079 --> 3811.1600000000003
a Layman is an

3807.24 --> 3813.8799999999997
idiot in Greek that's really

3811.16 --> 3817.1189999999997
weird I'm going to go with

3813.88 --> 3819.52
no that's not the the definition of

3817.119 --> 3823.7200000000003
idiot that I

3819.52 --> 3823.72
know but uh

3833.279 --> 3836.279
huh

3840.599 --> 3845.799
bro rednecks would never forget that

3843.16 --> 3848.3999999999996
plants need water whoa woodworking guny

3845.799 --> 3851.96
bear no no no no

3848.4 --> 3856.2000000000003
no he didn't get the title no no they

3851.96 --> 3858.76
can be made to

3856.2 --> 3862.3999999999996
forget

3858.76 --> 3866.2000000000003
yeah how do you get made to forget by

3862.4 --> 3866.2000000000003
water only coming out of the to

3867.279 --> 3873.64
toilet everybody gets all permanent

3870.839 --> 3876.48
sugar highs which really eats away at

3873.64 --> 3879.8799999999997
your concentration did you know that

3876.48 --> 3881.96
continual sugar it it starts to eat at

3879.88 --> 3886.359
your

3881.96 --> 3889.119
concentration you can you can definitely

3886.359 --> 3893.16
make rednecks over a couple Generations

3889.119 --> 3895.839
forget that plants need water oh

3893.16 --> 3899.279
yeah

3895.839 --> 3899.279
I mean it's got to be pretty bad

3900.799 --> 3906.72
though I mean if there's any people like

3904.0 --> 3908.559
living rural then it's not going to

3906.72 --> 3911.279
happen with

3908.559 --> 3912.599
them or like out in the woods right

3911.279 --> 3915.319
that's the kind of the funny thing with

3912.599 --> 3917.7200000000003
idiocracy too is that there's no mention

3915.319 --> 3920.839
at all of like

3917.72 --> 3923.0389999999998
people on the land it's all

3920.839 --> 3925.279
city that's how they showed the

3923.039 --> 3926.3190000000004
idiocracy it's it's they just showed you

3925.279 --> 3928.96
the

3926.319 --> 3931.279
city but when you really think about it

3928.96 --> 3934.119
carefully there might just

3931.279 --> 3937.48
be they did also like show farmers and

3934.119 --> 3937.48
all that but they they were

3942.4 --> 3947.48
unsuccessful right nexts are defined by

3945.16 --> 3947.48
being

3951.279 --> 3955.839
rural what w work in gy bear like think

3954.16 --> 3959.5989999999997
of it like

3955.839 --> 3962.68
this they could be made to forget by

3959.599 --> 3965.88
simply making it

3962.68 --> 3971.24
illegal and you know how they do

3965.88 --> 3975.839
that well what if the brondo company

3971.24 --> 3978.0
said like no we need more water for

3975.839 --> 3980.72
Brando you have to

3978.0 --> 3983.0
Lobby using water for anything other

3980.72 --> 3986.799
than the toilet to be

3983.0 --> 3988.839
illegal like and everybody's idiots

3986.799 --> 3992.48
they're just gonna let it happen so

3988.839 --> 3995.599
that's probably why that's prob why

3992.48 --> 3998.079
nobody knew it's because it was made

3995.599 --> 4001.0
illegal to use

3998.079 --> 4003.52
water and then everybody just forgot it

4001.0 --> 4003.52
just all

4007.72 --> 4012.2
halted yo borders boy hey hey [ __ ]

4011.079 --> 4014.6400000000003

4038.839 --> 4045.44
great all right oh that's

4042.92 --> 4046.319
probably

4045.44 --> 4048.44
a

4046.319 --> 4050.319
ad from the

4048.44 --> 4053.4
Brando from the

4050.319 --> 4056.0
Bro company right it was just their ad

4053.4 --> 4058.48
said like oh plants crave

4056.0 --> 4060.079
it it was a lie but they were just

4058.48 --> 4062.88
allowed to do that and then everybody

4060.079 --> 4062.88
started believing

4072.92 --> 4076.92
it what the hell are you talking about

4096.0 --> 4099.239
teret what

4102.839 --> 4105.839
the

4132.799 --> 4135.799
h

4142.0 --> 4146.0

4173.6 --> 4177.279
oh yeah don't make sure that doesn't

4176.239 --> 4182.3589999999995

again slowmo that's really

4188.279 --> 4191.799000000001
bad all right all

4196.56 --> 4204.120000000001

4198.12 --> 4204.12
or they just secretly poison all food

4206.12 --> 4210.76
sources and like make sure you don't

4208.159 --> 4213.08
find out and then you eat any food and

4210.76 --> 4216.21

like spray you with like laomiz

4216.21 --> 4219.22
[Music]

4221.48 --> 4226.4
chemicals right I mean if the only thing

4224.6 --> 4228.8
that has to happen wood work and gy bear

4226.4 --> 4232.44
is that you your Independence would

4228.8 --> 4236.400000000001
officially become declared a threat to

4232.44 --> 4236.4
the nation and it done it's

4247.4 --> 4252.28
over yeah I know it woodworking gunny

4250.239 --> 4254.799999999999
bear dude I've already heard that song

4252.28 --> 4257.4
like a thousand times through the Alex

4254.8 --> 4257.400000000001
Jones Show

4267.36 --> 4272.839999999999
alone yeah by the

4269.6 --> 4276.4400000000005
way situation is very doable I just eat

4272.84 --> 4280.96
my Illuminati C on no problems

4276.44 --> 4280.96
whatsoever I'm just happy there's no

4281.239 --> 4286.28
pain at all like at all which is

4289.28 --> 4295.8
great wow Nathan seems to be very late

4292.56 --> 4298.56
today which is funny cuz so am

4295.8 --> 4301.159000000001
I he still hasn't gone live he just

4298.56 --> 4301.159000000001
threw out the

4312.56 --> 4315.56
link

4332.88 --> 4339.719
hopefully he's not having PC

4336.0 --> 4341.8
problems maybe Jo he's trying out all

4339.719 --> 4345.8
kinds of

4341.8 --> 4348.08
things I I mean he just got his perfect

4345.8 --> 4349.719
computer he got he got it all perfect so

4348.08 --> 4351.679
of course that means he has to now

4349.719 --> 4353.679
completely start over again try and add

4351.679 --> 4356.36
new things so that he could Tinker

4353.679 --> 4358.8
another few hundred

4356.36 --> 4362.04
hours I mean it's really tinkering

4358.8 --> 4363.84
addiction it really is it's not even a a

4362.04 --> 4365.92
joke anymore it's not even a running

4363.84 --> 4369.719
it's literally

4365.92 --> 4372.719
that you can't help it

4369.719 --> 4375.159
like if you're getting so used to trying

4372.719 --> 4379.56
fixing things then once you really fix

4375.159 --> 4381.5599999999995
it it's like it hurts it hurts that it's

4379.56 --> 4382.76
perfect that there's nothing more you

4381.56 --> 4385.52
can do that

4382.76 --> 4387.96
hurts so you start to like [ __ ] around

4385.52 --> 4391.0
so you build something new so you have

4387.96 --> 4394.84
more work to do that's what it is about

4391.0 --> 4394.84
that's what the real tinkering addiction

4395.84 --> 4400.56
is anyway yeah Richard G thanks for

4398.28 --> 4400.5599999999995
being

4402.36 --> 4405.36
here

4408.76 --> 4415.719

4411.0 --> 4415.719

4440.32 --> 4444.44
Patricia SC steer is extremely

4444.76 --> 4448.96
cute I was a little bit in love with her

4448.08 --> 4451.48
at the

4448.96 --> 4454.6
time but I was probably not the only one

4451.48 --> 4457.678999999999
I mean she's extremely

4454.6 --> 4460.4400000000005

4462.28 --> 4465.28
but

4475.0 --> 4481.44

4477.76 --> 4483.96

4481.44 --> 4483.96
about it

4492.28 --> 4495.28
though

4505.28 --> 4512.84
Sergeant was like a poppy dog dude

lady I found her to be incredibly

4552.199 --> 4555.199
Charming

4558.28 --> 4564.4
she is no I think she still is but she's

4560.88 --> 4564.400000000001
not really doing anything with

4577.06 --> 4585.120000000001
[Applause]

4582.12 --> 4585.12
it

4585.679 --> 4592.52
ah Nathan's going

4588.4 --> 4595.599999999999
live too bad I'm doing my

4592.52 --> 4598.8
show and I got 39 watching I'm happy to

4595.6 --> 4601.1990000000005
have 39 watching please don't go

4598.8 --> 4603.360000000001
away you know what his show is going to

4601.199 --> 4603.36
be

4605.04 --> 4610.4
about Flat Earth documentary came

4610.719 --> 4615.08
up no

4616.52 --> 4622.92
no she wasn't like that at all Luke

4619.08 --> 4625.719
Kramers look I actually got to know her

4622.92 --> 4630.0
followed her talked with her even in

4625.719 --> 4630.0
private uh she did

4630.92 --> 4636.28
not like why she left was because of

4633.88 --> 4639.04
infighting

4636.28 --> 4641.48
crap because of flat earthers going

4639.04 --> 4644.679
after flat other flat earthers

4641.48 --> 4646.879999999999
and like there was no understanding yet

4644.679 --> 4650.52
of like difference between Flat Earth

4646.88 --> 4652.719
and Feasta nonsense side and she just

4650.52 --> 4655.280000000001
she just wanted everybody to have peace

4652.719 --> 4657.4
and just be a community and it just

4655.28 --> 4660.08
wouldn't work it would work for a little

4657.4 --> 4663.0
bit and then everything like exploded

4660.08 --> 4666.08
again and she got sick of

4663.0 --> 4668.84
that because she just couldn't do

4666.08 --> 4672.0
anything with it and she refused to pick

4668.84 --> 4674.56
parties she just hated

4672.0 --> 4676.239
it when when the infighting happened and

4674.56 --> 4679.96
I think that that is really the thing

4676.239 --> 4683.718999999999
that like made her quit because she just

4679.96 --> 4687.76
didn't want it's like all of Flat Earth

4683.719 --> 4690.4800000000005
was like her boyfriend and her boyfriend

4687.76 --> 4693.320000000001
just refused to stop bickering and

4690.48 --> 4696.28
fighting periodically and that's why she

4693.32 --> 4699.48
left her boyfriend which is all of Flat

4696.28 --> 4701.599999999999
Earth that's kind of what it was like

4699.48 --> 4704.5599999999995
it's just like she got sick of all the

4701.6 --> 4708.88
freaking in fighting all the

4704.56 --> 4708.88
time so she just divorced

4713.719 --> 4720.159
it right and I'm not talking sexual I'm

4716.719 --> 4723.88
talking emotional she was

4720.159 --> 4727.719
like she like she's the person that just

4723.88 --> 4732.2390000000005
like knows the name of a thousand people

4727.719 --> 4734.92
okay I don't I absolutely do not she did

4732.239 --> 4734.919999999999
and does

4737.76 --> 4742.159000000001
so and she did kind of treat like

4740.32 --> 4744.4
everybody's like oh you're all my

4742.159 --> 4747.839999999999
friends because you're into Flat

4744.4 --> 4750.199
Earth but I hate infighting and then

4747.84 --> 4751.8
everybody would go infighting anyway

4750.199 --> 4753.48
like including people that she was

4751.8 --> 4755.4800000000005
really like please don't do that please

4753.48 --> 4757.5199999999995
don't get with them please don't do the

4755.48 --> 4759.759999999999
infighting and then they would all do it

4757.52 --> 4763.88
anyway and she just got like [ __ ] all of

4759.76 --> 4765.76
you [ __ ] you you're all [ __ ]

4763.88 --> 4768.2390000000005
I don't want to have anything to do with

4765.76 --> 4771.6
this and that's kind of

4768.239 --> 4775.36
like what made her

4771.6 --> 4775.360000000001
leave get her on my

4777.12 --> 4784.159
show I don't think she wants

4780.56 --> 4786.679
to it would be awesome though but I

4784.159 --> 4790.199
mean it would be kind of weird for her

4786.679 --> 4790.1990000000005
to do that

4790.84 --> 4794.84
and I'm too friction

4795.679 --> 4801.8
I mean I got the rageing

4797.76 --> 4804.159000000001
thing and I don't think she wants that

4801.8 --> 4807.719
to be like associated with her even

4804.159 --> 4809.679
indirectly I'm not sure though I maybe

4807.719 --> 4814.159
she's not even all that aware about it

4809.679 --> 4816.4400000000005
it's just that I know she will like

4814.159 --> 4818.44
resent that side of me

4816.44 --> 4821.44
enormously even though she will like

4818.44 --> 4821.44
also understand

4821.76 --> 4826.52
emotionally like there is frustrations

4824.52 --> 4830.76
like man even in those interviews she's

4826.52 --> 4830.76
always been like very understanding of

4831.48 --> 4837.12
me but like what would it accomplish if

4834.199 --> 4838.839999999999
I got her on like once it just everybody

4837.12 --> 4841.4
will just start calling her up like oh

4838.84 --> 4842.84
get back on YouTube get back on YouTube

4841.4 --> 4844.28
and then it's going to be the same [ __ ]

4842.84 --> 4847.0
over

4844.28 --> 4848.8
again but I mean yeah the idea I it

4847.0 --> 4851.56
would be really cool if I could get

4848.8 --> 4854.719
Patricia steer on also just to know like

4851.56 --> 4854.719
hey how are you doing

4861.159 --> 4867.32
actually but I don't even at this point

4864.28 --> 4867.32
know how to contact

4870.12 --> 4877.36
her I mean I had contact with her over

4873.4 --> 4879.879999999999
Skype but she kind of left all of

4877.36 --> 4881.639
it because people just kept harassing

4879.88 --> 4884.639
her

4881.639 --> 4884.639
everywhere

4899.08 --> 4906.679
what the hell okay borders boy and Teran

4902.32 --> 4909.44
are talking Indian Cuisine I

4906.679 --> 4912.159
guess all righty

4909.44 --> 4915.599999999999
then right but I think I'm going to

4912.159 --> 4918.4
round out this show that turned out

4915.6 --> 4918.400000000001
longer than an

4918.8 --> 4924.679
hour I thought it was pretty good show

4921.32 --> 4928.0
did you guys not enjoy

4924.679 --> 4932.0
this everything everyone was calling her

4928.0 --> 4932.0
a [ __ ] yeah but that I mean

4932.159 --> 4936.159
seriously all those people need to all

4934.639 --> 4939.4800000000005
get kicked in the

4936.159 --> 4943.159
nuts calling her a [ __ ] is just too

4939.48 --> 4946.5599999999995
[ __ ] up as especially if you consider

4943.159 --> 4950.0
the source of this nonsense

4946.56 --> 4953.0
okay cuz I don't want to like bring

4950.0 --> 4956.4
disgusting things back up but I mean

4953.0 --> 4960.04
yeah you know who brought it up oh she's

4956.4 --> 4966.0
a try yeah Antonio

4960.04 --> 4970.48
subat who had a sexual relationship

4966.0 --> 4974.4
admittedly with her for like half a year

4970.48 --> 4976.879999999999
or something like that yeah and he said

4974.4 --> 4979.04
that she's a [ __ ] okay yeah God Rest

4976.88 --> 4982.2390000000005
his soul indeed but I mean he did

4979.04 --> 4984.6
basically say I just had a sexual

4982.239 --> 4988.759999999999
relationship for half a year with a with

4984.6 --> 4992.56
a man that built himself into a

4988.76 --> 4994.04
woman like he that guy's [ __ ] insane

4992.56 --> 4996.84
okay when it comes socially to

4994.04 --> 4998.6
relationships and all that he's insane

4996.84 --> 5001.400000000001
because he's literally saying yeah I

4998.6 --> 5003.400000000001
just [ __ ] the [ __ ] for half a year

5001.4 --> 5006.04
and live with her

5003.4 --> 5009.04
and now going to say oh try try you're

5006.04 --> 5011.76
out of your mind Antonio and you done a

5009.04 --> 5013.88
lot of damage with your petty disgusting

5011.76 --> 5016.52
jealousy and you probably got cancer

5013.88 --> 5016.52
from that and

5018.08 --> 5023.32
died which in a yeah I I I cannot help

5021.639 --> 5026.36
but say that in a way you kind of

5023.32 --> 5031.0
deserve that because it was that [ __ ]

5026.36 --> 5031.0
Petty that you did that it's absolutely

5031.48 --> 5035.36
disgusting

5033.12 --> 5039.239
not [ __ ] her now yeah I

5035.36 --> 5043.679
know okay but that's where those rumors

5039.239 --> 5047.08
came from he said it after having had a

5043.679 --> 5049.32
relation sexual relationship with her

5047.08 --> 5051.32
for like half a year and then calling

5049.32 --> 5053.5599999999995
her a tra I mean that's just [ __ ]

5051.32 --> 5057.44
[ __ ] dude and they all bought it and

5053.56 --> 5060.4400000000005
it's [ __ ] she is definitely a born

5057.44 --> 5060.44
woman

5061.36 --> 5069.12
okay and a beautiful one too man like

5065.8 --> 5075.400000000001
dude if I'd like gone back in

5069.12 --> 5078.36
time say 30 years with like

5075.4 --> 5080.799999999999
man but I probably would be like to

5078.36 --> 5084.96
scared to even address her because she's

5080.8 --> 5084.96
be so like Jesus Christ you're

5087.48 --> 5093.28
hot but she would probably not even see

5090.28 --> 5095.96
me I don't know and she she's still hot

5093.28 --> 5098.5599999999995
even at this age she's still very

5095.96 --> 5099.76
attractive but also she's just really

5098.56 --> 5102.76
good at

5099.76 --> 5102.76
maintenance

5108.56 --> 5111.56
anyway

5112.04 --> 5117.199
what am I still talking about Patricia

5115.119 --> 5119.639
yeah I'm still talking about

5117.199 --> 5122.0
Patricia somebody brought up the stupid

5119.639 --> 5124.28
[ __ ] thing and I thought I needed to

5122.0 --> 5124.28
address

5127.4 --> 5136.199
that and how ridiculous that claim even

5131.6 --> 5136.1990000000005
was considering where it came

5151.28 --> 5154.28
from

5158.639 --> 5162.76
but uh yeah I mean I'd love to get her

5160.719 --> 5165.52
back on

5162.76 --> 5167.92
and I'd probably just ask her about

5165.52 --> 5170.719
America like how is America changed how

5167.92 --> 5174.1990000000005
is your like daily life change

5170.719 --> 5176.8
like I'd like as ask more like General

5174.199 --> 5178.919999999999

not going to have a longer show just so

5285.0 --> 5290.96
you know make sure it doesn't happen and

5293.92 --> 5297.8
okay but if you're going to be like this

5296.48 --> 5299.879999999999
even if you're going to talk about

5297.8 --> 5304.04
Indian food or something back and forth

5299.88 --> 5304.04
that's all fine as long as it keeps

5304.36 --> 5309.5199999999995

5306.52 --> 5312.4800000000005
