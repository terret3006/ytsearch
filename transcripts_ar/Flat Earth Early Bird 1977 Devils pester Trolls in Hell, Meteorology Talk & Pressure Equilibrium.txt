186.159 --> 190.79899999999998
okay well forast says that after the

189.08 --> 195.44000000000003
weekend it's going to get a little

190.799 --> 195.44
warmer so kind of looking forward to

197.12 --> 201.239
that although there's not a lot of sun

199.56 --> 205.239
in that

201.239 --> 205.239
forecast terrible

230.879 --> 236.51899999999998
right let see what was I doing yesterday

240.0 --> 243.0
e

272.8 --> 276.479
I got a lot of responses

285.639 --> 294.88
yesterday

287.68 --> 294.88
oh hello person socker count today bye

317.88 --> 325.68
but I I'm so incredibly resistant

321.12 --> 328.36
against criticism I mean if I don't just

325.68 --> 331.199
thank all the trolls for just being

328.36 --> 334.039
absolutely miserable

331.199 --> 336.91900000000004
scumbags that only can see the negative

334.039 --> 339.199
about anything that I ever do and only

336.919 --> 341.24
suggestions they ever make is I do

339.199 --> 344.0
exactly the opposite with my life

341.24 --> 346.40000000000003
everything that I ever do which is not

344.0 --> 349.8
realistic and when I would do it it

346.4 --> 352.52
would literally not help me at all but I

349.8 --> 356.039
mean yeah man that's the problem the

352.52 --> 358.71999999999997
problem is I don't let trolls talk [ __ ]

356.039 --> 360.31899999999996
to me all the time with idiotic

358.72 --> 362.96000000000004
suggestions

360.319 --> 366.40000000000003
that are extremely

362.96 --> 369.79999999999995
counterproductive or simply suggestions

366.4 --> 372.79999999999995
that are not attainable and not

369.8 --> 377.8
reasonable that's the

372.8 --> 382.08
problem yeah problem is is that I just

377.8 --> 385.12
don't C blanch do whatever some faceless

382.08 --> 388.31899999999996
[ __ ] internet troll tells me who just

people that spend all their time just

427.599 --> 433.44

anonymously and telling them to off

themselves that's evil I'm so evil that

437.199 --> 442.72
I just want to get rid of people that

just let them eat you

470.28 --> 473.63899999999995

474.96 --> 481.44
reasonable yeah it's safe to say that

477.639 --> 481.44
it's not going to be a

484.84 --> 492.28
I mean they keep trying to gas light

488.24 --> 492.28000000000003
everybody like that it's

497.84 --> 503.919
ridiculous and it's obviously not going

500.639 --> 503.919
to work

512.56 --> 521.0799999999999
right I'm so evil that just people that

516.08 --> 523.8000000000001
I contact would like to be on my

521.08 --> 525.64
show well that that can only happen if

523.8 --> 529.4399999999999

531.76 --> 537.12
want

533.36 --> 537.12
terrible terrible

538.44 --> 545.0790000000001
people that are like

540.8 --> 547.3599999999999
the personified expression of misery I

545.079 --> 551.4799999999999
want them to end their own life that is

547.36 --> 551.48
just that is just [ __ ]

555.72 --> 558.72
outrageous

559.8 --> 564.56
right yeah yeah now I have absolutely no

562.88 --> 567.16
problem with

564.56 --> 571.16
that I mean

567.16 --> 574.279
people say such things to other people

571.16 --> 575.88
just for being in some kind of political

574.279 --> 579.32
oppositional

575.88 --> 582.079
Camp yeah now that's evil that's like

579.32 --> 582.0790000000001
completely

584.48 --> 588.44
ridiculous I don't wish anything like

586.72 --> 590.9200000000001
that to my political

588.44 --> 594.5600000000001
opponent which I guess would be

590.92 --> 596.519
Ballers even though they really really

594.56 --> 601.3199999999999
annoy me at

596.519 --> 605.519
times now I do it to people that

601.32 --> 608.7600000000001
exclusively spend all their time trying

605.519 --> 612.12
to make individuals

608.76 --> 615.72
miserable and they do it anonymously I

612.12 --> 615.72
mean that's just

616.72 --> 621.48
evil but uh yeah no I'll not start this

620.0 --> 623.279
show is not going to be just me

621.48 --> 624.76
complaining about the trolls it's kind

623.279 --> 627.399
of

624.76 --> 630.399
pointless but I just bumped into these

627.399 --> 630.399
comments

634.68 --> 639.3199999999999
right as I was starting the show just

636.839 --> 639.32
look at

649.68 --> 655.56
around all right so there's plenty

652.48 --> 655.5600000000001
things happening in the

657.079 --> 664.4399999999999
world apparently the Roth Childs are

660.2 --> 664.44
taking up business in Saudi Arabia

664.76 --> 673.279
now is highly

668.88 --> 673.279
suspicious it's unusual

690.24 --> 698.44
let's see other than

693.519 --> 698.44
that nothing super remarkable

728.2 --> 731.2
h

759.92 --> 766.079
right so yeah it's going to be kind of a

762.519 --> 768.48
slow start I got the feeling today again

766.079 --> 768.4799999999999
that's

768.519 --> 774.279
fine just going to make it a short show

771.16 --> 777.199
and then everybody can show up 2 and 1/2

774.279 --> 779.56
hours in and be like oh wait what

777.199 --> 783.4399999999999
happened oh wait you're rounding out

779.56 --> 785.04
show you're rounding out yeah yeah I

783.44 --> 790.0400000000001
will be rounding out the show because

785.04 --> 793.199
you all showed up super [ __ ] late and

790.04 --> 796.88
basically left me to my own devices to

793.199 --> 800.3199999999999
try to fill in the

796.88 --> 803.04
show there nobody to reflect

800.32 --> 805.9200000000001
upon except for wtim is

803.04 --> 807.8389999999999
here but he's probably really busy too

805.92 --> 811.12
so he's not going to be continually

807.839 --> 811.12
chatting with me

817.399 --> 819.68
that's

821.0 --> 828.32
fine right anyhow I got the

823.92 --> 828.3199999999999
communication back from Crow trip

832.56 --> 839.5999999999999
7 and I think I got a uh show with them

836.6 --> 841.0400000000001
in what is it now three weeks

839.6 --> 844.519
so that should be

841.04 --> 848.959
interesting I've not gotten any

844.519 --> 848.9590000000001
communication back from Russian vids

856.0 --> 864.36
yet but he did say that he would like to

860.24 --> 864.36
be on the night ow show so that could be

864.88 --> 870.24
interesting yeah as for Crow trip 7 I'd

868.0 --> 872.759
probably have to like

870.24 --> 875.839
watch some of his stuff more recent

872.759 --> 875.839
stuff to kind of catch

882.0 --> 890.199
up try to figure out what he is all

885.32 --> 896.24
about other than gatria and all that

890.199 --> 896.24
and just see what he's doing these days

927.6 --> 932.12
right okay me

977.68 --> 984.3599999999999
okay so Optimus just sent me an email

981.44 --> 986.44
that I that he's blocked in the chat is

984.36 --> 989.0
that

986.44 --> 991.72
true cuz I could just see him here and

989.0 --> 995.36
he's not in my blocked list or anything

991.72 --> 995.36
so that doesn't make any damn

1009.88 --> 1016.16
sense okay apparently he wanted to say

1012.44 --> 1016.1600000000001
more things but they didn't come

1016.199 --> 1020.8389999999999
through oh no there he is

1024.88 --> 1031.0390000000002
now you can type

1026.72 --> 1034.039
yeah weird yeah it is kind of weird it's

1031.039 --> 1034.039

1329.96 --> 1338.64
they do I do see them being dead at some

1334.799 --> 1340.1589999999999
point and then probably stuck in a cage

1338.64 --> 1342.72
in some hellish

1340.159 --> 1346.679
landscape with continual demons coming

1342.72 --> 1351.679

1610.399 --> 1615.8799999999999
simply experience to the level of

1612.919 --> 1619.2
intensity where it seems

1615.88 --> 1622.7990000000002
forever it doesn't really matter to me

1619.2 --> 1625.52
me it's all just a matter of expression

1622.799 --> 1625.52
as far as I'm

1631.36 --> 1639.76
concerned oh oh here comes Moxy the real

1634.679 --> 1639.76
Moxy oh but he knows no you

1642.64 --> 1648.72
don't yeah zap and you would actually do

1645.96 --> 1650.88
that probably but you're not doing that

1648.72 --> 1654.279
right

1650.88 --> 1656.8400000000001
now yeah you can't fool me I mean in a

1654.279 --> 1659.32
couple of months you two could just be

1656.84 --> 1661.76
completely miserable pieces of [ __ ]

1659.32 --> 1666.08
suddenly out of

1661.76 --> 1668.24
nowhere Moxy so uh I'm just not dumb

1666.08 --> 1672.32
enough to think that some sock account

1668.24 --> 1674.799
that is like named after you and

1672.32 --> 1676.96
hybridized with some stupid theme that

1674.799 --> 1679.0
that it is actually you when they're all

1676.96 --> 1680.559
socker accounts that are made that day

1679.0 --> 1682.72
when your main accounts aren't even

1680.559 --> 1687.399
blocked yeah I'm not that [ __ ]

1682.72 --> 1690.519
[ __ ] yeah I'm not like a 60 IQ Jello

1687.399 --> 1690.5189999999998
fish that

1691.279 --> 1696.039
just like an autistic Jello fish that

1694.32 --> 1698.36
just seees something and then

1696.039 --> 1700.519
immediately thinks that it's their mommy

1698.36 --> 1703.399
or daddy or something yeah I'm not that

1700.519 --> 1706.3990000000001
[ __ ] stupid I mean those trolls think

1703.399 --> 1708.4399999999998
I'm that stupid cuz they're projecting

1706.399 --> 1711.0
that level of stupidity which is is

1708.44 --> 1713.799
probably the level of stupidity that

1711.0 --> 1716.96
they're at except like one little step

1713.799 --> 1720.2
above it so that's like the intended

1716.96 --> 1720.2
target for

1721.96 --> 1729.64
them yeah they're trying to troll me

1726.159 --> 1731.88
with a level of stupidity that reflects

1729.64 --> 1736.2
their

1731.88 --> 1736.2
retardation not mine

1751.6 --> 1754.36
[Music]

1752.72 --> 1757.6000000000001
socer with your

1754.36 --> 1759.799
names must have been clear yeah probably

1757.6 --> 1764.1589999999999
could be

1759.799 --> 1768.96
clear clear is certainly taking his Hell

1764.159 --> 1770.96
Tour his Vengeance Hell Tour for God

1768.96 --> 1773.76
taking his daddy

1770.96 --> 1776.6000000000001
away right because I mean that's a good

1773.76 --> 1780.72
excuse to just start saying oh Jesus is

1776.6 --> 1784.279
a pedophile oh everything is hate now

1780.72 --> 1784.279
yeah I'm I'm sure that's the

1788.12 --> 1793.039
solution or maybe it isn't maybe I I

1790.96 --> 1795.72
don't even think it is clear it's just

1793.039 --> 1798.559
one of these other nameless

1795.72 --> 1801.279
faceless miserable miserable

1798.559 --> 1804.72
scumbag that's just like barely even

1801.279 --> 1804.72
holding on to life at

1807.799 --> 1813.43

[ __ ]

1826.559 --> 1831.399
[ __ ] with his

1828.48 --> 1833.48
[ __ ]

1831.399 --> 1835.9599999999998
characters haven't you noticed that

1833.48 --> 1838.76
every time Ted has some undercover

1835.96 --> 1841.039
character I hate all of his undercover

1838.76 --> 1844.519
characters I always end up hating them

1841.039 --> 1848.44
because he can't help himself but just

1844.519 --> 1852.48
Express just his own repulsive [ __ ]

1848.44 --> 1854.6000000000001
demonic nature and graft that into his

1852.48 --> 1857.679
characters because he just can't help he

1854.6 --> 1860.799
has to show that he's a [ __ ] demon on

1857.679 --> 1864.2
the inside he can't help it

1860.799 --> 1866.84
yeah like a psychotic killer can't help

1864.2 --> 1868.72
but just like show up at the crime scene

1866.84 --> 1871.24
because he's just he hopes secretly

1868.72 --> 1874.84
somebody is's going to figure it out the

1871.24 --> 1874.84
Demonic nature

1890.36 --> 1894.12
they made donations to be streams in

1892.639 --> 1896.36
your

1894.12 --> 1899.1589999999999
name okay

1896.36 --> 1902.559
said that is weird I mean they're

1899.159 --> 1902.5590000000002
[ __ ] out of their minds

1906.279 --> 1914.679
man oh oh look oh a message that's not

1910.639 --> 1914.6789999999999
going to show up oh

1960.919 --> 1965.72
yeah I guess today is a bit of a troll

1962.96 --> 1965.72
Fest and that's

1965.76 --> 1972.559
fine I'm kind of pissed off about the

1969.44 --> 1975.559
weather sucks I just want some bloody

1972.559 --> 1975.559
summer

1978.559 --> 1983.799
I mean this is the type of weather you'd

1980.76 --> 1988.1589999999999
be expecting in late September or

1983.799 --> 1988.1589999999999
something like literally this is

1990.84 --> 1997.039
ridiculous this is not mid June weather

2019.399 --> 2024.1589999999999
hey Bill sign good to see you

2041.36 --> 2045.76
oh

2042.76 --> 2045.76
wow

2046.24 --> 2054.919
cool a person that's not a sock troll

2050.24 --> 2054.919
made today hello

2069.119 --> 2074.8
tons of rain but they're saying July and

2072.2 --> 2077.5989999999997
August will be above heat oh yeah sure

2074.8 --> 2077.599
they're saying

2080.24 --> 2086.0789999999997
that dude the freaking climate change

2083.919 --> 2089.7599999999998
Nut Cases here in the Netherlands in the

2086.079 --> 2093.8390000000004
politics are still like alarming oh my

2089.76 --> 2096.2000000000003
God spring was so hot dude we've had

2093.839 --> 2098.0
like the shittiest rainiest coldest

2096.2 --> 2101.96
summer

2098.0 --> 2105.119
in over a decade here like ongoing right

2101.96 --> 2108.68
now and they're still literally saying

2105.119 --> 2114.079
like oh my God we are risking global

2108.68 --> 2114.0789999999997
warming I mean it's so [ __ ]

2123.52 --> 2128.16
unbelievable well sha G

2134.4 --> 2141.04
summer starts officially 20th of June

2138.04 --> 2141.04
really

2141.599 --> 2148.4
H yeah I guess that makes sense but I

2144.72 --> 2151.9599999999996
mean in the last 10 decade it's been

2148.4 --> 2155.44
like in May that's when the summer like

2151.96 --> 2155.44
it gets warm

2163.04 --> 2167.52
I had already kind of

2164.68 --> 2169.24
like made a new model for the entire

2167.52 --> 2171.8
thing saying that there's like a a

2169.24 --> 2174.7999999999997
pre-summer and then an after

2171.8 --> 2179.8390000000004
summer cuz it would get kind of like

2174.8 --> 2179.8390000000004
summer in May normally

2194.52 --> 2200.8
right you have a for prummer and after

2197.599 --> 2203.88
summer and then like Midsummer it would

2200.8 --> 2206.319
be like me still warm but nothing

2203.88 --> 2209.44
spectacular but in May it would be very

2206.319 --> 2211.7599999999998
hot and then potentially late August and

2209.44 --> 2214.76
September would still be very

2211.76 --> 2219.119
warm like that's what it's been like in

2214.76 --> 2219.119
the last 10 years

2221.079 --> 2226.4
but yeah this year it seems like the way

2224.28 --> 2228.8
that's worked in the last 10 years is

2226.4 --> 2232.96
just over and now it just kind of sucks

2228.8 --> 2235.0
again it's like to me it's like a I was

2232.96 --> 2237.8
so happy with the climate change that

2235.0 --> 2239.56
had happened because I I like that I

2237.8 --> 2242.6400000000003
like better

2239.56 --> 2244.56
Summers I don't want it to be the way

2242.64 --> 2247.0789999999997
that it was like all around the '90s

2244.56 --> 2249.96
where it's like it's just always [ __ ]

2247.079 --> 2251.96
raining all the time all summer all

2249.96 --> 2257.04
winter always [ __ ]

2251.96 --> 2257.04
raining yeah cuz that sucks

2280.2 --> 2284.9199999999996
106 Fahrenheit I don't know is that warm

2282.8 --> 2287.6800000000003
I I can never size up the whole

2284.92 --> 2287.6800000000003
Fahrenheit

2289.319 --> 2297.119
thing I I could just never get a feel

2292.2 --> 2297.1189999999997
for that fenite temperature system at

2306.0 --> 2316.4
all 41 Celsius oh yeah that is kind of

2311.2 --> 2316.3999999999996
hot I mean that's proper summer

2321.04 --> 2329.88
heat 50 Celsius no that's n that's

2326.2 --> 2335.64
Overkill like that's desert

2329.88 --> 2335.6400000000003
heat or Madrid heat it Peak

2336.44 --> 2340.4
summer for

2372.079 --> 2377.7200000000003
I'm also thinking that there is

2374.52 --> 2381.96
literally like a plan for

2377.72 --> 2384.9599999999996
this I don't know whether the plan

2381.96 --> 2389.04
like the you know there's this whole new

2384.96 --> 2391.65
scam that's trying they're just trying

2389.04 --> 2393.319
to unfold the whole new bird flu

2391.65 --> 2395.599
[Music]

2393.319 --> 2397.64
[ __ ] it might have something to do

2395.599 --> 2399.92
with the weather either they're trying

2397.64 --> 2402.56
to cause the weather or they just knew

2399.92 --> 2404.6800000000003
it was going to be this kind of weather

2402.56 --> 2407.88
in this

2404.68 --> 2409.96
period and then they hope like oh that

2407.88 --> 2413.2400000000002
maybe the chickens or whatever are going

2409.96 --> 2416.119
to like just get sick of all the

2413.24 --> 2421.359
moist and it not being super warm and

2416.119 --> 2423.7200000000003
that they would then be inclined to get

2421.359 --> 2428.04
sick so that they could just like

2423.72 --> 2428.04
declare this nonsense emergency

2430.2 --> 2433.0789999999997
that they of course

2437.64 --> 2443.68
want right I mean they can do whatever

2440.92 --> 2445.359
they like I mean oh it gets super hot

2443.68 --> 2449.8799999999997
it's very simple then it's like oh

2445.359 --> 2452.92
climate alarmism oh no oh let's

2449.88 --> 2455.319
forbid uh air conditioning right that's

2452.92 --> 2459.48
what they would do then oh it's get it's

2455.319 --> 2462.68
a super rainy cold old summer oh well oh

2459.48 --> 2464.44
some flu pandemic will break

2462.68 --> 2467.5989999999997
out

2464.44 --> 2468.88
then let's kill all the animals well

2467.599 --> 2470.56
that's what they're going to do then I

2468.88 --> 2472.96
mean that's how it

2470.56 --> 2475.0
works whatever is going to happen they

2472.96 --> 2477.0
got some shitty response to make

2475.0 --> 2480.359
everything worse for everybody they

2477.0 --> 2480.359
always do

2502.48 --> 2508.079
maybe start cloud seating this year well

2506.16 --> 2511.2
it's like officially admitted that there

2508.079 --> 2514.2000000000003
are tests being done in

2511.2 --> 2517.96
the here in the

2514.2 --> 2520.5989999999997
Netherlands University of Del

2517.96 --> 2523.04
with like climate modification and cloud

2520.599 --> 2525.6800000000003
seating I mean there was like articles

2523.04 --> 2525.68
about that

2528.24 --> 2531.56
recently and

2534.28 --> 2540.8
suspicions oh oh oh I wouldn't no that's

2543.599 --> 2547.88
you what the

2551.4 --> 2554.4
okay

2586.319 --> 2592.079
well hello HRA

2589.079 --> 2595.559
rraa seems like you're a sock too

2592.079 --> 2595.559
although I don't know why

2597.44 --> 2604.8
you use an account that's like over

2600.44 --> 2604.8
three years old for that

2631.119 --> 2636.839
who's responsible for building clouds

2634.4 --> 2638.079
what are you talking about responsible

2636.839 --> 2642.48
they not

2638.079 --> 2642.48
responsible for the weather

2669.64 --> 2672.4
I mean here in the Netherlands there's

2671.16 --> 2676.359
just this

2672.4 --> 2679.4
whole group that's basically Water

2676.359 --> 2682.839
Management well water management clouds

2679.4 --> 2682.839
would fall under that

2685.68 --> 2691.64
so I say that's the direction to look it

2689.44 --> 2691.64
look

2696.04 --> 2699.04
in

2725.96 --> 2729.96
e for

2737.86 --> 2743.5
[Music]

2769.16 --> 2773.72
uh no clutch I don't think that they

2771.24 --> 2776.839
believe that at all that's kind of weird

2773.72 --> 2776.839
that D suggest

2780.88 --> 2787.2400000000002
that due to

2783.72 --> 2789.9599999999996
overseeding no Sanji It's Not Over over

2787.24 --> 2793.359
seating it's just if you're going to

2789.96 --> 2794.48
Cloud seat when there is more moist in

2793.359 --> 2798.2
the

2794.48 --> 2800.2
air then you anticipate it and it's too

2798.2 --> 2801.8799999999997
high and then you start seeding then it

2800.2 --> 2804.5589999999997
has like

2801.88 --> 2807.8
this draining

2804.559 --> 2810.0400000000004
effect where basically like all of it

2807.8 --> 2813.92
just gets pulled out of the

2810.04 --> 2815.72
air right so you want some rain and You'

2813.92 --> 2817.8
be like oh well this this amount of

2815.72 --> 2819.359
water in the air okay that's Cloud seed

2817.8 --> 2821.48
and then that water is going to come out

2819.359 --> 2824.0789999999997
but if the water that was in the air was

2821.48 --> 2826.319
basically three times higher

2824.079 --> 2828.559
concentration then you anticipate it

2826.319 --> 2832.0
well then you get a

2828.559 --> 2834.52
flood that's what happened it's not all

2832.0 --> 2837.079
they pump out more cloud seeding no they

2834.52 --> 2840.119
just underestimated how much moist was

2837.079 --> 2844.44
in the air while cloud seeding that's

2840.119 --> 2844.44
the reason why it floods

2866.76 --> 2870.5200000000004
hello Kumo virus

2897.559 --> 2903.44
wow that coffee really helped

2900.079 --> 2908.48
though I was feeling kind of

2903.44 --> 2908.48
wonky before the show but

2908.68 --> 2912.68
that really woke me up

2916.75 --> 2919.88
[Music]

2942.2 --> 2949.0789999999997
right but this is how I see it look uh

2946.48 --> 2951.2
weather

2949.079 --> 2953.52
control is something that's been

2951.2 --> 2956.359
developed in the last 30 years or

2953.52 --> 2960.64
something with a lot of

2956.359 --> 2962.44
tests and everybody probably thought

2960.64 --> 2964.5589999999997
like oh they're manipulating the weather

2962.44 --> 2966.96
that means they have it now under

2964.559 --> 2968.8390000000004
perfect control that's the part part

2966.96 --> 2972.559
where I'm going to step in and say like

2968.839 --> 2975.799
uh no no they don't have perfect

2972.559 --> 2979.4
control like at all there will be

2975.799 --> 2979.4
unexpected things that

2980.76 --> 2987.559
happen and sudden floods are one of

2985.28 --> 2990.3590000000004
those things it's like yeah you're s

2987.559 --> 2992.28
cloud seeding and then

2990.359 --> 2993.72
underestimating how much water is going

2992.28 --> 2996.8390000000004
to come out of the

2993.72 --> 2999.359
sky seen it in Dubai and you're probably

2996.839 --> 3001.88
going to see it in some more

2999.359 --> 3004.44
places right especially places that will

3001.88 --> 3006.44
be relatively dry and then it's like

3004.44 --> 3009.559
decided like oh we're going to use the

3006.44 --> 3009.559
weather manipulation

3010.2 --> 3017.1189999999997
to to yeah to get some rain there and

3014.319 --> 3019.92
then they like miscalculate and then

3017.119 --> 3019.92
suddenly there's a

3020.119 --> 3026.2000000000003
flood now this I think naturally happens

3023.64 --> 3028.96
in California region where it's like

3026.2 --> 3031.68
super dry until it rains and then it all

3028.96 --> 3034.96
floods but that's like on

3031.68 --> 3037.5989999999997
record happening

3034.96 --> 3040.359
there and even a couple of hundred years

3037.599 --> 3043.319
ago those planes were all flooded for a

3040.359 --> 3046.04
period so that is like inherent to the

3043.319 --> 3046.04
environment

3046.359 --> 3054.24
there but not in Dubai

3049.68 --> 3058.64
though and nor in Europe anywhere that

3054.24 --> 3058.64
that doesn't naturally happen there

3066.96 --> 3073.04
you used to be a Dopey moonlanding Den

3075.16 --> 3079.16
what hey Woodwork and guny

3083.2 --> 3088.48
bear the ground's ability to absorb the

3086.119 --> 3090.119
moisture yeah but that's that's

3088.48 --> 3092.359
perfectly logical especially in the

3090.119 --> 3096.599
California region

3092.359 --> 3098.2
because if it's always very dry and

3096.599 --> 3100.599
sunny

3098.2 --> 3103.5989999999997
then like the ground's not going to

3100.599 --> 3105.7200000000003
absorb the water as easily well if

3103.599 --> 3108.079
there's a lot of water going back and

3105.72 --> 3112.0
forth because of regular

3108.079 --> 3114.1600000000003
rain then it will be able to absorb

3112.0 --> 3117.359
water much more

3114.16 --> 3120.0
quickly if it's always dry

3117.359 --> 3123.0789999999997
well the dryness is basically going to

3120.0 --> 3125.72
effectively form like this air layer

3123.079 --> 3129.2400000000002
within the dirt that prevents the water

3125.72 --> 3129.24
from seeping through

3139.839 --> 3145.24
it regions where there's regular rain

3143.52 --> 3148.7599999999998
will

3145.24 --> 3153.16
always abs absorb the water much more

3148.76 --> 3155.559
easily and like absorb it into the

3153.16 --> 3157.799
groundwater it will always work better

3155.559 --> 3160.079
in regions where there's regular rain

3157.799 --> 3162.48
compared to Regions where there's never

3160.079 --> 3165.1600000000003
any rain and it's always dry and then

3162.48 --> 3167.76
suddenly a giant Cloud burst well it's

3165.16 --> 3173.1189999999997
not going to be absorbed so

3167.76 --> 3173.119
easily cuz the ground's all dried up

3182.81 --> 3185.84
[Music]

3191.559 --> 3199.7200000000003
this California after a long dry yes

3194.599 --> 3199.7200000000003
work Mar gy I was talking about that

3234.0 --> 3239.4

[Music]

3284.57 --> 3287.7090000000003
[Music]

3295.2 --> 3298.319
get what are you talking about

3306.64 --> 3311.4
normal trails that dissipate right away

3309.16 --> 3313.64
yeah well normal trails that dissipate

3311.4 --> 3315.7400000000002
right away are con Trails they're

3313.64 --> 3317.359
condensation Trails

3315.74 --> 3320.72
[Music]

3317.359 --> 3322.96
exclusively like if it's actually dust

3320.72 --> 3327.52
of some kind solid material which is

3322.96 --> 3327.52
what supposed to be

3327.88 --> 3332.2000000000003
it's not going to dissipate immediately

3330.44 --> 3335.119
that's the difference between a camp

3332.2 --> 3337.359
Trail alleged and a

3335.119 --> 3341.119
contrail contrail

3337.359 --> 3344.96
dissolve immediately after a few

3341.119 --> 3346.4
seconds without any Trace chemtrail

3344.96 --> 3349.28
doesn't

3346.4 --> 3350.559
dissolve there's solid particles left

3349.28 --> 3354.28
behind that

3350.559 --> 3359.44
then wave out like a

3354.28 --> 3359.44
feather those are solid particles go

3391.64 --> 3397.92
what okay that's crazy would work any

3394.319 --> 3397.92
there that's a extreme

3398.72 --> 3403.72
contrast contrails also form clouds and

3402.0 --> 3407.799
stay

3403.72 --> 3410.72
no no they don't because of the

3407.799 --> 3414.2
altitude it

3410.72 --> 3416.8799999999997
doesn't yeah airplanes don't fly at

3414.2 --> 3420.319
Cloud height

3416.88 --> 3424.119
they fly above Cloud

3420.319 --> 3426.64
height the moist they leave behind is

3424.119 --> 3430.7200000000003
not just going to sit there like a cloud

3426.64 --> 3430.72
because it's too high for

3440.52 --> 3447.68
it it's not at a height where there's

3444.559 --> 3448.7200000000003
enough moist and everything for yeah to

3447.68 --> 3452.44
form

3448.72 --> 3456.5989999999997
clouds so it's just immediately going to

3452.44 --> 3459.68
dissipate dissolve back into the

3456.599 --> 3463.6800000000003
air and then in its dissolved State

3459.68 --> 3466.0389999999998
probably dwell downward slowly toward

3463.68 --> 3468.68
Cloud

3466.039 --> 3472.88
height and then maybe add to those

3468.68 --> 3472.8799999999997
clouds that might be there

3489.079 --> 3491.559
what

3492.68 --> 3497.2
no makes no sense

3513.599 --> 3517.559
what about those earthquake machines I

3515.359 --> 3519.2
don't know it has absolutely nothing to

3517.559 --> 3521.76
do with weather manipulation that we

3519.2 --> 3521.7599999999998
were talking

3532.24 --> 3537.2
about right I mean what about volcano

3535.119 --> 3540.319
eruptions MO

3537.2 --> 3542.16
see what about that oh yeah that has

3540.319 --> 3545.0
absolutely nothing to do with what we

3542.16 --> 3545.0
were talking about

3545.28 --> 3550.52
either it's kind of the same thing

3547.68 --> 3554.0
except it's absolutely not the same

3550.52 --> 3554.0
thing at all

3592.359 --> 3596.68
okay it looks like moxy's interest is

3594.68 --> 3599.9199999999996
losing cohesion because is starting to

3596.68 --> 3603.5989999999997
blabber on nonsense now all right anyway

3599.92 --> 3603.599
I'll be right back

3633.96 --> 3636.96
for

3663.96 --> 3666.96
for

3678.88 --> 3682.149
[Music]

3694.44 --> 3697.0
and I'm

3708.44 --> 3712.44
back machines

3731.76 --> 3736.119
what freezing rain that isn't that

3734.839 --> 3740.0389999999998
called

3736.119 --> 3740.039
hail woodworking guny

3741.68 --> 3747.839
bear oh wait immediately freezes when it

3744.88 --> 3747.839
land then no that's called

3751.92 --> 3760.319
sleep right it's like super cooled water

3756.64 --> 3762.24
that's like refuses to freeze but then

3760.319 --> 3764.4
when it touches the surface then it

3762.24 --> 3766.3999999999996
immediately like

3764.4 --> 3767.76
crystallizes it's called

3766.4 --> 3771.2000000000003
[Music]

3767.76 --> 3771.2000000000003
SLE yeah that's

3771.64 --> 3778.7599999999998
weird and very hazardous for vehicles

3775.68 --> 3778.7599999999998
that drive on the

3796.119 --> 3802.2400000000002
road SLE is also ready that makes no

3799.52 --> 3807.079
sense kumu

3802.24 --> 3810.4799999999996
virus raining ice that's called hail

3807.079 --> 3810.48
it's snow or

3817.799 --> 3824.0389999999998
hail generally sleep is like it's water

3821.64 --> 3827.44
it's just super

3824.039 --> 3829.92
cold like so cold that if it touches

3827.44 --> 3833.2000000000003
Solid Surfaces that are also cold that

3829.92 --> 3835.2000000000003
it immediately crystallizes freezes up

3833.2 --> 3837.48
but that it the the rain itself is

3835.2 --> 3840.839
liquid and if you're like in that you

3837.48 --> 3840.839
cool off

3840.92 --> 3847.88
dramatically unlike when it hails and

3843.319 --> 3847.88
you just get bumped by a bunch of haill

3854.92 --> 3859.279
stones slushy right

3863.4 --> 3869.76
exactly well slushy that's just like wet

3891.0 --> 3897.039
snow hey hello by the way Lucy level

3893.559 --> 3897.039
good to see you

3900.52 --> 3905.0
slushes melting yeah man all these

3902.96 --> 3907.7200000000003
different

3905.0 --> 3910.599
conditions isn't that weird how all

3907.72 --> 3914.52
these different types of

3910.599 --> 3917.799
snow and rain all have these different

3914.52 --> 3917.799
effects and different

3924.64 --> 3928.68
names for

3957.79 --> 3964.5589999999997
[Music]

3960.4 --> 3964.559
what how does that make any

3964.96 --> 3972.64
sense precipitation consisting of ice

3968.48 --> 3975.359
pallets with rain or snow

3972.64 --> 3980.8799999999997
what so is it

3975.359 --> 3980.88
mixed mixed with ah right okay

4004.48 --> 4007.599
[Music]

4028.039 --> 4034.119
okay that's weird so sleep would be in

4031.0 --> 4036.839
between in between snow and

4034.119 --> 4039.319
hail then

4036.839 --> 4042.0789999999997
apparently weird I thought that sleep

4039.319 --> 4046.799
was different I thought that it was like

4042.079 --> 4049.0
super cooled rain that Still Remains

4046.799 --> 4050.0389999999998
liquid until it touches the surface and

4049.0 --> 4054.44
then

4050.039 --> 4054.44
freezes but yeah

4057.68 --> 4063.72
whatever right the idea would be

4060.76 --> 4065.2400000000002
like technically they say all rain

4063.72 --> 4066.7599999999998
starts out

4065.24 --> 4071.3999999999996
as

4066.76 --> 4073.88
ice or hail then it goes down because

4071.4 --> 4073.88
density

4074.0 --> 4078.92
increase then it melts due to the

4077.0 --> 4081.599
temperature of the air it goes through

4078.92 --> 4081.599
turns into

4082.279 --> 4089.279
rain and then depending on the

4085.279 --> 4092.24
temperature it can freeze back up again

4089.279 --> 4095.039
in a certain layer but it could also

4092.24 --> 4098.0
like that the ground would be super cold

4095.039 --> 4100.12
the air above it not s that super cold

4098.0 --> 4103.159
and that basically rain just comes down

4100.12 --> 4106.719
and then freezes up as soon as it

4103.159 --> 4106.719
touches the ground

4106.839 --> 4115.2789999999995
and I thought that those conditions

4108.719 --> 4115.279
would like be called Sleek but whatever

4164.92 --> 4170.56
hey bigger than 5 mm what

4168.08 --> 4171.679
really oh I didn't know it was defined

4170.56 --> 4175.679
like

4171.679 --> 4175.679
that huh

4217.99 --> 4222.92
[Music]

4220.4 --> 4228.28
whatever oh at least it's not raining

4222.92 --> 4228.28
here not here that's something for

4284.4 --> 4289.92
right yes s forms when rain partially

4287.4 --> 4293.4
melted snow freezes as it falls right

4289.92 --> 4295.12
because there's like but that also then

4293.4 --> 4297.638999999999
that's like when there's a lot of cold

4295.12 --> 4300.32
air at

4297.639 --> 4303.76
ground and that also creates the

4300.32 --> 4307.48
conditions that you can get like super

4303.76 --> 4311.4400000000005
cold rain that literally freezes upon

4307.48 --> 4315.36
touch so that I

4311.44 --> 4317.638999999999
guess I was right at that

4315.36 --> 4321.799999999999
so sleep is really

4317.639 --> 4326.8
about very cold air at ground

4321.8 --> 4328.6
level influencing the rain or snow as it

4326.8 --> 4330.679
like approaches the ground because

4328.6 --> 4334.120000000001
there's all these different air layers

4330.679 --> 4336.2390000000005
that have different influences on the

4334.12 --> 4338.92
precipitation all depends on what the

4336.239 --> 4342.5599999999995
temperatures with every air layer are

4338.92 --> 4342.56
for the end result

4372.96 --> 4377.0
why are we talking about meteorology

4381.44 --> 4384.48
better than freezing

4384.84 --> 4390.679
ring yeah but sleep

4387.48 --> 4394.239
conditions do also typically lead to

4390.679 --> 4394.2390000000005
freezing rain

4405.639 --> 4412.679
I was the info guy in my

4412.679 --> 4415.679
Menat

4425.92 --> 4433.639
rather hey Rich G why is it called

4431.32 --> 4437.639
meteor

4433.639 --> 4437.639
uh I just look up

4437.88 --> 4443.36
the the atmology of meteor and then

4440.76 --> 4443.360000000001
you'll find

4464.04 --> 4468.04
out for

4629.52 --> 4636.56
this isn't about flat versus

glob yeah I know I know there no

4636.56 --> 4639.2390000000005
discussion

4639.8 --> 4647.1990000000005
there right I mean for any meteorology

4643.48 --> 4650.04
to work you have to have a

4647.199 --> 4653.4
container so there's no discussion there

4650.04 --> 4656.12
meteorology does not work on a globe

4653.4 --> 4658.679
Earth because you require containment

4656.12 --> 4662.48
and why the

4658.679 --> 4662.4800000000005
hell YouTube keep

4664.0 --> 4668.08
stalling this is this just

4670.84 --> 4675.0
me come on

4678.52 --> 4683.56
is anybody else having stalling issues

4681.199 --> 4683.5599999999995
with the

4736.719 --> 4743.84
from Modern

4739.32 --> 4746.44
meteor yeah denoting any atmospheric

4743.84 --> 4752.12
phenomenon so

4746.44 --> 4752.12
meteor is literally anything in the

4753.639 --> 4760.92
sky but you'd never expected that right

4757.32 --> 4764.36
so technically even calling it

4760.92 --> 4766.719
atmosphere is kind of like a new way to

4764.36 --> 4766.719
call it

4767.199 --> 4772.239
we should be calling the

4769.56 --> 4775.56
atmosphere the

4772.239 --> 4777.44
meteor really like logically the

4775.56 --> 4781.719
atmosphere should

4777.44 --> 4781.719
be called the

4783.48 --> 4789.12
meteor according to

4786.04 --> 4792.32
atmology isn't that just

4789.12 --> 4795.679
something how weird that we then

4792.32 --> 4800.44
describe meteor to like a

4795.679 --> 4804.0
weird apparent rock that might enter the

4800.44 --> 4806.599999999999
meteor which is basically the the proper

4804.0 --> 4806.6
word for

4812.28 --> 4817.04
atmosphere because atmosphere just means

4818.44 --> 4825.678999999999
air in a sphere which makes no sense

4821.88 --> 4828.36
it's like a globers word that was

4825.679 --> 4830.8
inserted when atmosphere should be

4828.36 --> 4833.04
called the

4830.8 --> 4836.08
meteor because

4833.04 --> 4841.48
meteor in the original

4836.08 --> 4845.0
meteoros is basically the area above

4841.48 --> 4845.0
you that's the

4845.32 --> 4848.32
Latin

4849.719 --> 4855.88
meteor isn't that just

4853.0 --> 4858.719
interesting so English technically

4855.88 --> 4864.679
invented the word

4858.719 --> 4864.679
atmosphere it should be called meteor or

4867.88 --> 4871.32
meteor weird

4875.08 --> 4882.679
huh P can't exist with

4878.76 --> 4886.56
that's it's ridiculous thing to say Z

4882.679 --> 4886.56
happy ridiculous

4900.76 --> 4906.400000000001
surface is a better word than container

4903.76 --> 4909.679
in regards to what gas pressure

4906.4 --> 4914.638999999999
requires uh no cuz the surface has to be

4909.679 --> 4918.0
in all sides it has to be contained

4914.639 --> 4919.92
just a surface is not sufficient to

4918.0 --> 4922.719
create the gas pressure

4919.92 --> 4924.76
because it will then press in the

4922.719 --> 4926.639
direction where there is not a surface

4924.76 --> 4928.08
because it goes in all directions until

4926.639 --> 4931.96
stopped by a

4928.08 --> 4931.96
surface it has to be a

4932.239 --> 4937.159
container the one surface does not

4934.8 --> 4940.1990000000005
create gas

4937.159 --> 4943.159
pressure it has to be an

4940.199 --> 4946.159
enveloped surface in other words a

4943.159 --> 4946.159
container

4948.44 --> 4953.239
so I don't know why you're bringing on

4951.239 --> 4956.5599999999995
this

4953.239 --> 4956.919999999999
weird thing here Richard G this is like

4956.56 --> 4959.080000000001
your

4956.92 --> 4962.4800000000005
[Music]

4959.08 --> 4964.159
new I'm not going to call it beite maybe

4962.48 --> 4965.599999999999
it's more like what the hell was his

4964.159 --> 4970.04
name

4965.6 --> 4970.04
again I what the [ __ ] was

4971.48 --> 4978.28
his this is like years ago

4975.12 --> 4982.159
it was this guy no

4978.28 --> 4982.159
pressure the [ __ ] was his

4984.12 --> 4988.92
name I

4986.08 --> 4991.4
forgot but there was this guy who was

4988.92 --> 4991.4
always

4993.199 --> 5000.48
arguing that you didn't need a container

4996.52 --> 5004.719
for pressure ridiculous I completely

5000.48 --> 5006.919999999999
forgot his name

5004.719 --> 5011.2390000000005
that's like a British accent guy who

5006.92 --> 5014.1990000000005
actually did with his voice like a come

5011.239 --> 5016.28
on flatter debates and he had his own

5014.199 --> 5019.919999999999
channel and everything I just completely

5016.28 --> 5019.92
forgot his name

5039.28 --> 5046.04
anybody here has any memory for anything

5042.639 --> 5048.4400000000005
that's not like more less than one year

5046.04 --> 5050.0
old does anybody here know anything

5048.44 --> 5052.5599999999995
about anything that's happened in the

5050.0 --> 5052.56
last 10

5052.719 --> 5057.36
years it's on the tip of my tongue

5060.36 --> 5065.719
um spur schemo that's it

5065.96 --> 5072.84
spur chemo no pressure that that was his

5069.88 --> 5076.0
thing he started like questioning that

5072.84 --> 5078.56
[ __ ] it doesn't

5076.0 --> 5082.76
work gas pressure

5078.56 --> 5085.400000000001
requires a surface enveloping the entire

5082.76 --> 5088.92
volume in order for pressure to be

5085.4 --> 5093.119
established there's a hole in a

5088.92 --> 5097.56
container the gas will then proceed to

5093.119 --> 5100.679
exit that volume that is contained

5097.56 --> 5104.04
through the hole in the container and

5100.679 --> 5107.2390000000005
exit it and not create the pressure it

5104.04 --> 5110.04
will use the container to press itself

5107.239 --> 5110.04
out of the

5112.44 --> 5117.96
container CU it will try to go in all

5114.8 --> 5121.119000000001
directions but there's one place where

5117.96 --> 5123.679
it then can go and then Evacuate the

5121.119 --> 5126.32
container which is open cuz there's a

5123.679 --> 5126.32
hole in it

5135.36 --> 5139.5599999999995
if you have enough pressure

5140.639 --> 5147.639
constant what no the pressure is only

5144.4 --> 5150.0
there because it is pressing in all

5147.639 --> 5153.32
directions pressing on the

5150.0 --> 5156.32
container then causes the gas to be

5153.32 --> 5160.96
pressurized and press against all the

5156.32 --> 5160.96
other gas which then presses against the

5168.56 --> 5174.360000000001
container yeah gas pressure is only gas

5171.36 --> 5176.5599999999995
pre pressure CU it presses on all the

5174.36 --> 5178.839999999999
other gas that surrounds it that

5176.56 --> 5181.159000000001
eventually ends up pressing on the

5178.84 --> 5185.6
container take the container away and

5181.159 --> 5185.599999999999
the whole thing goes like Domino

5194.199 --> 5200.48
right even with a freaking gradient even

5197.08 --> 5204.0
with a gradient yeah you you make a hole

5200.48 --> 5206.678999999999
at at the spot where the pressure is the

5204.0 --> 5209.96
the lowest within a

5206.679 --> 5212.159
container then despite there being lower

5209.96 --> 5214.8
pressure there relative to other regions

5212.159 --> 5215.839999999999
of the container the whole thing is

5214.8 --> 5218.76
going to

5215.84 --> 5220.6
shift and suddenly even where the lower

5218.76 --> 5223.76
pressure is there's going to be a

5220.6 --> 5227.0
massive pressure build up yeah

5223.76 --> 5230.360000000001
ironically because the equilibrium of

5227.0 --> 5233.639
the entire container has

5230.36 --> 5233.639
changed and

5233.76 --> 5239.400000000001
thus the gradient no longer functions no

5237.52 --> 5243.080000000001
longer will

5239.4 --> 5246.199
stabilize in that dynamic because the

5243.08 --> 5248.48
container equilibri has been disrupted a

5246.199 --> 5249.32
gas pressure gradient comes forth out of

5248.48 --> 5252.239
the

5249.32 --> 5255.28
equilibrium within the container if that

5252.239 --> 5257.599999999999
container is altered and there's a hole

5255.28 --> 5259.679
then the equilibrium will like

5257.6 --> 5263.04
immediately start to

5259.679 --> 5265.32
distort a pressure will build up where

5263.04 --> 5267.4
the hole in the container is even though

5265.32 --> 5269.96
there was lower pressure

5267.4 --> 5271.239
there because of the equilibrium within

5269.96 --> 5273.639
the closed

5271.239 --> 5277.04
container and then the pressure of the

5273.639 --> 5279.679
gas will will evacuate out of the hole

5277.04 --> 5284.199
and the average pressure in the entire

5279.679 --> 5284.1990000000005
container will go down that's what

5300.28 --> 5307.5599999999995
happens pressure doesn't mean oh God oh

5304.84 --> 5307.56
my

5307.679 --> 5313.8
God Kumar you're so tedious

5314.4 --> 5320.119
[Music]

5317.0 --> 5322.6
sometimes yeah yeah pressure literally

5320.119 --> 5322.599999999999
means

5322.84 --> 5332.08
press pressure is pressing

5327.0 --> 5332.08
pressure is the act of

5332.32 --> 5339.04
pressing that's literally what pressure

5335.56 --> 5341.400000000001
is to say that pressure does not mean

5339.04 --> 5345.04
press is

5341.4 --> 5347.759999999999
asinine it's literally what it does

5345.04 --> 5350.239
mean oh pressure gets around ground

5347.76 --> 5351.88
level yeah but it only exists around

5350.239 --> 5354.239
ground level because there's an

5351.88 --> 5357.6
equilibrium within the closed system

5354.239 --> 5360.4
that allows the gas pressure gradient to

5357.6 --> 5363.320000000001
form as it

5360.4 --> 5365.44
does a gas pressure gradient can only

5363.32 --> 5368.159
form if there's an equilibrium within

5365.44 --> 5368.159
the closed

5369.6 --> 5376.08
system if it's not a closed system then

5372.52 --> 5376.080000000001
a gradient can

5376.199 --> 5382.44
form yeah

5378.159 --> 5386.36
because a gas pressure gradient requires

5382.44 --> 5389.36
gas pressure gas pressure requires a

5386.36 --> 5389.36
container

5402.56 --> 5407.159000000001
you're not 100 what the [ __ ] Richard G

5405.44 --> 5409.839999999999
you're just weird

5407.159 --> 5412.5199999999995
now what do you mean there's you're not

5409.84 --> 5415.679
sure if there's a vacuum no there is not

5412.52 --> 5420.080000000001
a vacuum of space that's

5415.679 --> 5420.08
insane it's a human

5422.719 --> 5427.4
conception there's no space there's no

5427.639 --> 5434.8
volume I mean some flat earthers think

5430.639 --> 5436.719
there's water infinite water uh well you

5434.8 --> 5438.96
could argue that to a certain degree

5436.719 --> 5441.28
because water under certain levels of

5438.96 --> 5444.04
pressure

5441.28 --> 5448.4
cannot basically be compressed any

5444.04 --> 5449.719
further so infinite water theoretically

5448.4 --> 5452.44
makes more

5449.719 --> 5455.08
sense because water under certain level

5452.44 --> 5457.4
of pressure simply can not be pressured

5455.08 --> 5460.6
more like no matter

5457.4 --> 5462.08
what like you can have infinite pressure

5460.6 --> 5464.360000000001
on on

5462.08 --> 5469.119
water infinite

5464.36 --> 5471.679
pressure without it changing it will not

5469.119 --> 5473.5599999999995
be altered by the pressure it will not

5471.679 --> 5476.4800000000005
the molecular structure at some point

5473.56 --> 5479.2390000000005
will no longer be influenced by the

5476.48 --> 5481.799999999999
pressure so that just weird yeah you can

5479.239 --> 5484.5199999999995
decompress water it will evaporate but

5481.8 --> 5487.84
if you press water

5484.52 --> 5489.88
then eventually like the water is like

5487.84 --> 5493.08
more hard

5489.88 --> 5493.08
than than

5494.44 --> 5497.44
Tung

5497.52 --> 5503.080000000001
theoretically CU after a certain level

5500.119 --> 5506.839999999999
of pressure water cannot be compressed

5503.08 --> 5510.4
any further no matter what no matter if

5506.84 --> 5511.6
the entire Earth would be pressing on

5510.4 --> 5516.5199999999995
that

5511.6 --> 5519.320000000001
water and that is argumentation for why

5516.52 --> 5522.8
the whatever infinite volume that people

5519.32 --> 5524.759999999999
just have it has to be infinite because

5522.8 --> 5527.159000000001
you're humans and you just can't help

5524.76 --> 5529.2390000000005
yourself but imagine that kind of [ __ ]

5527.159 --> 5531.96
that you can't prove well if there's an

5529.239 --> 5534.599999999999
infinite volume well what would it be

5531.96 --> 5538.639
well not a vacuum that's

5534.6 --> 5541.04
insane but water You could argue that it

5538.639 --> 5545.28
could be

5541.04 --> 5548.36
water because water can potentially be

5545.28 --> 5550.679
involved in Infinity you could have

5548.36 --> 5553.5599999999995
infinite pressure because of infinite

5550.679 --> 5556.4400000000005
volume and then the water would still be

5553.56 --> 5556.4400000000005
and remain

5557.32 --> 5564.599999999999
water because after a certain level of

5560.6 --> 5567.56
pressure it just it won't be

5564.6 --> 5569.96
compressed it will just remain water and

5567.56 --> 5573.92
that's the fascinating thing about

5569.96 --> 5575.639
water but I mean that you'll have to

5573.92 --> 5578.119
assume there's water out there and then

5575.639 --> 5581.8
there's some kind of container that is

5578.119 --> 5584.28
basically shielding us off from this

5581.8 --> 5585.4400000000005
water and you would never get to that

5584.28 --> 5588.719
water

5585.44 --> 5590.678999999999
ever because yeah I mean break the

5588.719 --> 5593.639
shielding and the water just with

5590.679 --> 5595.32
literally infinite pressure just Rams

5593.639 --> 5597.119
right through in the realm and it's all

5595.32 --> 5601.92
gone

5597.119 --> 5605.28
bang like a massive submarine

5601.92 --> 5606.92
implosion because that is what what what

5605.28 --> 5609.84
Earth would be then the Earth realm

5606.92 --> 5612.36
would be like a submarine one freaking

5609.84 --> 5617.04
little hole in the side and

5612.36 --> 5621.04
is just bang it Instant

5617.04 --> 5622.56
Crush if we're surrounded by

5621.04 --> 5624.92
water

5622.56 --> 5627.320000000001
right now there's an alternative

5624.92 --> 5631.159
conception for that and that is there

5627.32 --> 5634.08
simply is not any volume in which matter

5631.159 --> 5636.719
can exist

5634.08 --> 5641.119
there is no space there's nothing

5636.719 --> 5644.08
there's no empty volume or filled volume

5641.119 --> 5647.4
there simply is no additional volume

5644.08 --> 5649.36
nonone space there nothing is there and

5647.4 --> 5651.759999999999
nothing could ever be

5649.36 --> 5654.44
there and that's kind of the theory that

5651.76 --> 5654.4400000000005
I hold on

5656.6 --> 5661.76
to yeah no infinite volume that has to

5660.119 --> 5664.32
somehow

5661.76 --> 5665.96
manage in which case it would be water

5664.32 --> 5667.799999999999
because water is the only thing that can

5665.96 --> 5669.639
be compressed Beyond a certain point no

5667.8 --> 5672.6
matter how much of it there is or how

5669.639 --> 5675.400000000001
much pressure so thetically that would

5672.6 --> 5677.52
pan out well what it would also pan out

5675.4 --> 5679.839999999999
is if there's simply the amount of

5677.52 --> 5681.080000000001
volume available for matter to exist in

5679.84 --> 5685.08
is

5681.08 --> 5688.199
limited that would also solve all the

5685.08 --> 5690.48
issues except for the human mind not

5688.199 --> 5693.36
wanting to accept that there isn't

5690.48 --> 5696.239
infinite volume which people always seem

5693.36 --> 5697.92
to like hold on

5696.239 --> 5701.48
to

5697.92 --> 5704.32
cuz in your life moving around it feels

5701.48 --> 5706.919999999999
like there is infinite volume and you to

5704.32 --> 5709.679
then realize well maybe no it isn't

5706.92 --> 5712.4800000000005
infinite and then humans like take it

5709.679 --> 5715.6
personal and like feel like oh my God

5712.48 --> 5719.0
I'm in a cage the realm has a limited

5715.6 --> 5722.1990000000005
volume I'm in a cage ridiculous you can

5719.0 --> 5726.199
walk around your entire life never

5722.199 --> 5730.839999999999
stopping and you'll never ever cover the

5726.199 --> 5733.638999999999
entire volume of the realm but if it's

5730.84 --> 5736.119000000001
just information or a thought that

5733.639 --> 5739.1990000000005
there's a limited volume and immediately

5736.119 --> 5740.08
people imagine themselves in a cage cuz

5739.199 --> 5744.4
they're

5740.08 --> 5744.4
ridiculous they're ridiculous about

5752.44 --> 5757.759999999999
it right

5754.4 --> 5761.96
so yeah imagine there's infinite volume

5757.76 --> 5764.52
all you like if that enables you to not

5761.96 --> 5767.76
go through life feeling like you're

5764.52 --> 5770.6
inside of a crampy little

5767.76 --> 5774.4400000000005
prison then yeah imagine whatever the

5770.6 --> 5774.4400000000005
[ __ ] you want man

5786.44 --> 5794.638999999999
how do you make different forms of ice

5789.6 --> 5800.400000000001
then uh you cool it off and then it

5794.639 --> 5802.92
expands because ice takes up more volume

5800.4 --> 5802.92
than

5807.0 --> 5813.08
water a kumu virus I mean that's

5810.36 --> 5815.92
something that you should learn when

5813.08 --> 5815.92
you're like like

5819.44 --> 5824.719
10 for somebody that's a fountain of

5822.52 --> 5826.52
information it's kind of ridiculous that

5824.719 --> 5828.96
you wouldn't know something so

5826.52 --> 5831.639
rudimentary that you learn in physics

5828.96 --> 5833.84
class at an extremely young

5831.639 --> 5836.719
age because you learn that at an

5833.84 --> 5836.719
extremely young

5836.88 --> 5842.1990000000005
age yeah unique properties of

5842.28 --> 5848.5599999999995
water when you freeze water reduce it to

5846.04 --> 5854.88
its solid state it

5848.56 --> 5854.88
expands if you put pressure on ice it

5861.679 --> 5867.8
melts yeah it's the only material that

5865.159 --> 5867.799999999999
works like

5869.599 --> 5877.88
that and that's why they use water

5872.88 --> 5877.88
freezing water to like break

5878.159 --> 5883.199
things to break rock to break

5884.36 --> 5891.36
mountains yeah you pour water in a hole

5888.159 --> 5893.44
then you chemically freeze the water

5891.36 --> 5896.5599999999995
well the water is going to when it

5893.44 --> 5899.919999999999
freezes into a solid ice it's going to

5896.56 --> 5905.04
expand like nothing can stop that and it

5899.92 --> 5905.04
will literally break a mountain apart

5907.679 --> 5912.599
yeah and water is the only material that

5910.04 --> 5915.119
does that it's the only material that

5912.599 --> 5917.599
when going from a liquid to a solid

5915.119 --> 5923.48
state it expands it's the

5917.599 --> 5923.4800000000005
only material that does that

5939.48 --> 5944.4
different forms of ice yeah I'm sure

5972.639 --> 5976.76
different forms ofice different yeah I'm

5974.36 --> 5979.5199999999995
sure you do I'm sure you want to move

5976.76 --> 5981.0
away from my rudimentary statement and

5979.52 --> 5984.0
know

5981.0 --> 5984.0
oh

5984.199 --> 5990.598999999999
quickly quickly recover

5987.32 --> 5992.28
from displaying ignorance in the face of

5990.599 --> 5994.76
rudimentary knowledge that you

5992.28 --> 5997.4
definitely should have known

5994.76 --> 6000.2390000000005
quickly quickly roll out a whole bunch

5997.4 --> 6004.04
of stuff to try to prove that you're

6000.239 --> 6004.04
smart that you're smart

6017.48 --> 6024.48
enough right but we can just stick to

6021.08 --> 6024.48
your require

6026.44 --> 6032.159
a container for gas pressure to form

6029.719 --> 6035.36
that you require a container for gas

6032.159 --> 6035.36
pressure to form a

6039.48 --> 6046.159
gradient yeah there's no situation in

6042.36 --> 6046.159
which you have some kind of gas

6047.239 --> 6053.638999999999
pressure in a container that you then

6050.84 --> 6056.4400000000005
like influence for coold and Heat to

6053.639 --> 6059.119
form a gradient and then you make that

6056.44 --> 6061.32
so extreme that at the cold side the

6059.119 --> 6065.08
pressure becomes extremely low which you

6061.32 --> 6067.96
would then open up with a hole to an

6065.08 --> 6071.639
environment that's much bigger that is

6067.96 --> 6073.719
exactly as cold and

6071.639 --> 6076.96
depressurized you know what

6073.719 --> 6080.52
happens the gradient instantly

6076.96 --> 6082.36
dissipates and the extra pressure at the

6080.52 --> 6085.400000000001
lower levels where it's heated up

6082.36 --> 6089.598999999999
immediately vacate through the hole into

6085.4 --> 6089.598999999999
the larger area of lower

6089.76 --> 6096.96
pressure cuz it doesn't matter that at

6094.719 --> 6100.08
the point where the hole in that

6096.96 --> 6101.639
gradient based container is formed like

6100.08 --> 6103.719
that right where the hole is that that

6101.639 --> 6105.2390000000005
pressure right there it would be of the

6103.719 --> 6108.92
same

6105.239 --> 6110.759999999999
pressure as the surrounding lower

6108.92 --> 6113.88
pressure container it doesn't matter

6110.76 --> 6116.400000000001
that that location right there is of the

6113.88 --> 6119.32
same pressure and temperature as the

6116.4 --> 6122.839999999999
surrounding larger

6119.32 --> 6126.679
container the equilibrium of that

6122.84 --> 6129.52
container is disrupted through the hole

6126.679 --> 6131.76
which disables the gradiation and

6129.52 --> 6135.040000000001
immediately makes the higher pressure

6131.76 --> 6139.56
part of that container vacate into the

6135.04 --> 6142.84
larger volume that's just how it

6139.56 --> 6146.080000000001
is right because a gas pressure gradient

6142.84 --> 6150.52
only forms if there's an

6146.08 --> 6150.5199999999995
equilibrium within the closed

6152.199 --> 6158.598999999999
system the equilibrium is

6155.239 --> 6161.5199999999995
distorted by the container opening up to

6158.599 --> 6163.639
another volume well then that gas

6161.52 --> 6165.1990000000005
pressure gradient will no longer

6163.639 --> 6168.159000000001
naturally

6165.199 --> 6171.239
form because the equilibrium of the

6168.159 --> 6175.119
container has been

6171.239 --> 6175.119
disrupted yeah

6178.48 --> 6183.48
so he just redirected your [ __ ]

6180.76 --> 6185.679
nonsense and all that all you want akumu

6183.48 --> 6188.759999999999
virus you just keep spamming it keep

6185.679 --> 6190.599
spamming your hor [ __ ] oh it's a device

6188.76 --> 6192.84
oh it works completely different oh

6190.599 --> 6195.159000000001
quickly distract away from the hardcore

6192.84 --> 6198.119000000001
facts that Arwin just laid down hardcore

6195.159 --> 6201.92
facts demonstrable hardcore facts that

6198.119 --> 6203.88
you can literally do on your own if you

6201.92 --> 6205.88
have the environment you can have like a

6203.88 --> 6207.88
mini laborator pressure laborator and

6205.88 --> 6210.400000000001
you could laboratory and can do it

6207.88 --> 6213.04
yourself and and prove that rwind is

6210.4 --> 6215.638999999999
right you can do that just like

6213.04 --> 6218.36
that

6215.639 --> 6219.88
yeah gas pressure gradient within a

6218.36 --> 6223.28
closed

6219.88 --> 6225.599
system can only have the different

6223.28 --> 6227.4
pressures as part of the gradient

6225.599 --> 6230.4800000000005
because of the equilibrium within the

6227.4 --> 6232.638999999999
closed system open a hole in that

6230.48 --> 6236.919999999999
container even at the lower pressure

6232.639 --> 6239.599
side to a larger volume of equally low

6236.92 --> 6242.56
pressure yeah volume surrounding it

6239.599 --> 6245.28
being equally low pressure well guess

6242.56 --> 6247.2390000000005
what it will disrupt the closed system

6245.28 --> 6249.719
that allowed the gas pressure gradient

6247.239 --> 6253.239
to form as it did and the higher

6249.719 --> 6255.56
pressure part of that little before

6253.239 --> 6257.44
closed system is immediately going to

6255.56 --> 6258.92
vacate through the hole and equalize

6257.44 --> 6262.159
with the larger

6258.92 --> 6264.04
volume cuz it doesn't matter that at the

6262.159 --> 6265.879999999999
high end

6264.04 --> 6267.56
of that closed system with the gas

6265.88 --> 6269.32
pressure grain there was low pressure

6267.56 --> 6271.4800000000005
and that that low pressure is equal to

6269.32 --> 6274.44
the low pressure outside it as soon as

6271.48 --> 6277.5199999999995
the hole is formed in between those two

6274.44 --> 6280.119
containers the equilibrium of that first

6277.52 --> 6283.88
container with the gradient as it Formed

6280.119 --> 6285.0
is distorted and immediately collapses

6283.88 --> 6287.8
and

6285.0 --> 6290.4
immediately the gradient is distorted

6287.8 --> 6294.679
and the higher pressure part of that

6290.4 --> 6297.879999999999
gradient will explode forth through the

6294.679 --> 6301.719
hole it's

6297.88 --> 6305.0
irrelevant that at the high end there

6301.719 --> 6308.2390000000005
was a low pressure part that's right

6305.0 --> 6310.8
next to another container with equally

6308.239 --> 6314.04
low pressure it doesn't matter because

6310.8 --> 6317.0
that low pressure only formed there

6314.04 --> 6319.679
because of the container equilibrium

6317.0 --> 6323.599
that allowed the gas pressure gradient

6319.679 --> 6325.32
to pan out like that it does matter that

6323.599 --> 6327.76
at one side there's a low pressure and

6325.32 --> 6329.599
that right next to it on the other side

6327.76 --> 6332.04
of the barrier is equally low pressure

6329.599 --> 6335.4800000000005
you created a hole between those two and

6332.04 --> 6337.5199999999995
the entire gradient collapses

6335.48 --> 6342.119
instantaneously because it could only

6337.52 --> 6344.4400000000005
form because of the stability the

6342.119 --> 6346.199
equilibrium that was formed within the

6344.44 --> 6348.04
closed

6346.199 --> 6352.719
system

6348.04 --> 6352.719
see that's how it works

6359.92 --> 6364.2390000000005
container Sho the most pressure be

6362.0 --> 6365.48
exerted on the walls it's all pressing

6364.239 --> 6368.28
on

6365.48 --> 6370.598999999999
everything all the gas presses on all

6368.28 --> 6372.4
the neighboring gas which presses on all

6370.599 --> 6373.88
the other neighboring gas which

6372.4 --> 6377.799999999999
eventually ends

6373.88 --> 6381.1990000000005
up chain pressing on the container every

6377.8 --> 6383.679
part of the gas presses on every other

6381.199 --> 6386.04
part of the gas because

6383.679 --> 6389.28
it eventually presses through the other

6386.04 --> 6389.28
gas on the container

6389.76 --> 6395.360000000001
wall yeah have one part of the container

6393.48 --> 6398.239
wall be

6395.36 --> 6401.48
gone and then the entire pressure

6398.239 --> 6401.48
equilibrium is

6408.56 --> 6415.88
distorted this is how it

6411.84 --> 6415.88
works for

6443.13 --> 6449.5
[Music]

6447.199 --> 6452.549999999999
where is it

6449.5 --> 6452.55
[Applause]

6453.16 --> 6456.29
[Music]

6473.27 --> 6476.4490000000005
[Music]

6492.239 --> 6496.919999999999
okay that's alter the title yeah

6494.28 --> 6500.36
pressure equilibrium definitely worth

6496.92 --> 6503.679
noting I mean I think I explained this

6500.36 --> 6507.96
very competently

6503.679 --> 6510.679
and I'd love somebody to actually do

6507.96 --> 6512.56
this just do

6510.679 --> 6516.1990000000005
it have

6512.56 --> 6519.4400000000005
some gas tank experimentation yeah you

6516.199 --> 6520.678999999999
take an aquarium or whatever have

6519.44 --> 6524.0
pressure in

6520.679 --> 6526.4400000000005
it that have cold influences on one side

6524.0 --> 6529.36
the top heat influence on the other side

6526.44 --> 6532.0
the bottom let the gas pressure gradient

6529.36 --> 6533.719
form then figure out oh what is the

6532.0 --> 6535.96
actual pressure at the top where the

6533.719 --> 6538.92
pressure is the lowest okay it's this

6535.96 --> 6541.56
amount right okay now you take that

6538.92 --> 6544.4
entire setup put it in a larger

6541.56 --> 6546.599
container and then make the pressure of

6544.4 --> 6548.879999999999
the larger container surrounding that

6546.599 --> 6552.599
gradiated container

6548.88 --> 6554.56
equal to the lowest pressure within the

6552.599 --> 6558.32
gradiated

6554.56 --> 6561.0
container have that the entire

6558.32 --> 6564.239
surrounding larger container adapt and

6561.0 --> 6566.52
become equal pressure not gradiate equal

6564.239 --> 6569.839999999999
pressure to the lowest pressure of the

6566.52 --> 6571.320000000001
gradiated container within it then open

6569.84 --> 6574.1990000000005
a

6571.32 --> 6577.08
hole between the

6574.199 --> 6579.239
lowest pressure within the gradiated

6577.08 --> 6581.679
container and the larger container

6579.239 --> 6583.959999999999
surrounding it and then watch as the

6581.679 --> 6587.36
entire equilibrium of the gradiated

6583.96 --> 6589.28
container is instantaneously distorted

6587.36 --> 6591.96
and the higher pressure part of the

6589.28 --> 6594.84
gradient container immediately explodes

6591.96 --> 6597.28
forth through the hole equalizing with

6594.84 --> 6598.4400000000005
the larger lower pressure container that

6597.28 --> 6602.48
surrounds

6598.44 --> 6605.719
it show it show how I'm right about this

6602.48 --> 6605.718999999999
because this is how it

6619.92 --> 6624.4800000000005
works yeah you can't have

6623.239 --> 6626.638999999999
gas

6624.48 --> 6632.5599999999995
pressure sitting

6626.639 --> 6632.56
there next to a large volume of lower

6635.239 --> 6641.799999999999
pressure you can have a gradient within

6638.56 --> 6643.4400000000005
a container with one part being lower

6641.8 --> 6646.159000000001
pressure and the other part higher

6643.44 --> 6651.36
pressure and it would be relatively

6646.159 --> 6653.36
equally spread out so it's like + 2 - 2

6651.36 --> 6655.32
equal volume roughly

6653.36 --> 6657.119
a gradient in that way yeah that

6655.32 --> 6659.0
gradient is not going to be oh there's

6657.119 --> 6661.28
just this one part where it's really

6659.0 --> 6664.52
high pressure then one part right next

6661.28 --> 6666.88
to it is lower pressure and then a 100

6664.52 --> 6669.280000000001
billion parts that is extremely low

6666.88 --> 6671.04
pressure yeah gas pressure gradients

6669.28 --> 6673.759999999999
don't form that

6671.04 --> 6675.639
way you can't create a gas pressure

6673.76 --> 6678.2390000000005
gradient under any circumstance no

6675.639 --> 6681.1990000000005
matter how much

6678.239 --> 6683.5199999999995
temperature alterations influxes

6681.199 --> 6686.239
influences you have you could never form

6683.52 --> 6689.320000000001
a gas pressure gradient that will pan

6686.239 --> 6695.28
out that way it's going to be pretty

6689.32 --> 6695.28
much plus 2 minus 2 equal volume

6696.0 --> 6702.56
roughly it's not going to be as a

6698.679 --> 6705.679
symmetrical as the heliocentric

6702.56 --> 6708.599
Universe forces it to

6705.679 --> 6712.079
be cuz gas pressure doesn't stick to a

6708.599 --> 6713.96
ball in the face of a infinite volume of

6712.079 --> 6716.639
low pressure it just doesn't work like

6713.96 --> 6719.84
that it can't work like that doesn't

6716.639 --> 6723.76
matter if the gas pressure is

6719.84 --> 6727.360000000001
gradiated yeah open that closed system

6723.76 --> 6730.159000000001
with the gradient up to a larger volume

6727.36 --> 6732.679
that is of equal low pressure as the

6730.159 --> 6735.44
lower pressure side of the gradient

6732.679 --> 6737.76
within the closed system and the entire

6735.44 --> 6741.0
system of the gradiated system will

6737.76 --> 6743.280000000001
explode forth through that hole into the

6741.0 --> 6746.92
larger system

6743.28 --> 6750.119
even though before you opened the hole

6746.92 --> 6752.679
the pressure would have been equal on

6750.119 --> 6756.5599999999995
either side of that closed

6752.679 --> 6756.56
system that's just how it

6759.73 --> 6762.879999999999
[Music]

6764.92 --> 6769.1990000000005
is all right hope you're all enjoying

6767.4 --> 6771.799999999999
the show if you are don't forget to

6769.199 --> 6775.5599999999995
rogans it up and somebody just support

6771.8 --> 6775.56
me once

6776.079 --> 6781.799999999999
just it would be really nice if I could

6778.76 --> 6787.639
get something for my efforts

6781.8 --> 6787.639
here I mean I am sharing pretty reliable

6787.92 --> 6794.0
information like this is high quality

6791.48 --> 6794.0
physics

6794.079 --> 6799.44
class most physics teachers in school

6796.96 --> 6802.599
are not going to get to this point where

6799.44 --> 6806.719
they're going to explain these Dynamics

6802.599 --> 6808.639
as meticulous as I do you will not find

6806.719 --> 6810.92
any physics teachers around the world

6808.639 --> 6813.719
that will do that I guarantee it like

6810.92 --> 6817.4800000000005
this what I'm telling you now is way

6813.719 --> 6821.2390000000005
more meticulous than even my physics

6817.48 --> 6823.28
teacher taught me about all of this and

6821.239 --> 6825.919999999999
I thought that my physics teacher was

6823.28 --> 6829.199
pretty damn meticulous and good and

6825.92 --> 6832.84
honorable yeah what I'm explaining to

6829.199 --> 6836.0
you now is way more detailed than even

6832.84 --> 6840.84
my physics teacher

6836.0 --> 6840.84
did like 30 Years Ago by

6845.079 --> 6852.48
now right and hey you want to prove me

6849.32 --> 6856.0
wrong do the setup do the setup as I

6852.48 --> 6858.839999999999
propose right one container temperature

6856.0 --> 6861.4
influences a gradient within the tanker

6858.84 --> 6864.0
surrounded by a bigger tanker without a

6861.4 --> 6866.96
gradient influence but with a low

6864.0 --> 6869.8
pressure equal to the low pressure side

6866.96 --> 6872.76
of the gradiated tanker open a hole in

6869.8 --> 6875.8
between and see the entire gradiated

6872.76 --> 6879.079000000001
tanker explode forth to equalize with

6875.8 --> 6880.639
the non-radiated lower press tanker

6879.079 --> 6883.0
that's what

6880.639 --> 6884.32
happens that's what will happen it

6883.0 --> 6888.36
doesn't

6884.32 --> 6889.92
matter that the lower pressure side of

6888.36 --> 6892.839999999999
the gradiated

6889.92 --> 6897.28
tanker was of equal pressure

6892.84 --> 6900.2390000000005
as the surrounding lower pressure tanker

6897.28 --> 6903.0
make a hole in between the

6900.239 --> 6905.759999999999
equilibrium of the gas pressure gradient

6903.0 --> 6907.56
will immediately be disrupted and the

6905.76 --> 6910.079000000001
entire pressure from the gradiated

6907.56 --> 6914.639
tanker will explode forth into the lower

6910.079 --> 6914.639
pressure tanker that's just what

6914.679 --> 6919.28
happens it's not going to sit there

6917.84 --> 6922.88
because that's not how gas pressure

6919.28 --> 6922.88
Dynamics work

6947.639 --> 6954.1990000000005
what's

6949.719 --> 6954.199
that what's that clutch

6955.76 --> 6959.599
oh yeah

6957.04 --> 6961.56
yeah yeah the barometer yeah the

6959.599 --> 6965.0
barometer just Compares

6961.56 --> 6967.719
pressures it has its own pressure to

6965.0 --> 6970.719
then compare with the pressure directly

6967.719 --> 6972.32
outside that is formed because of the

6970.719 --> 6975.56
container

6972.32 --> 6979.199
walls so it's like compare the pressure

6975.56 --> 6983.84
inside one set of container to The

6979.199 --> 6986.598999999999
Container it is in and it's pressure

6983.84 --> 6989.4800000000005
like comparing pressures that's how you

6986.599 --> 6992.0
then measure the pressure by one of

6989.48 --> 6995.159
these pressure systems the barometer

6992.0 --> 6995.159
being hyper

6995.239 --> 7002.28
stable and completely closed or isolated

6999.28 --> 7002.28
even

7017.239 --> 7022.079
right so I really hope you guys are

7019.28 --> 7024.5599999999995
appreciating my work

7022.079 --> 7029.92
here as a

7024.56 --> 7029.92
online flat earther YouTube physics

7033.32 --> 7038.88
teacher living off social welfare barely

7036.679 --> 7040.4
getting around it would be nice if I got

7038.88 --> 7044.159000000001
some

7040.4 --> 7044.159
support for what I do

7063.199 --> 7069.799999999999
if you guys not going to stop the

7066.28 --> 7072.679
[ __ ] in my chat SEPTA Moxy yumu

7069.8 --> 7075.88
virus I'm going to time you all out 24

7072.679 --> 7079.76
hours because you're being very annoying

7075.88 --> 7079.76
you're acting like 12y

7082.119 --> 7086.48
olds

7083.679 --> 7089.56
right

7086.48 --> 7091.48
hyperactive you'd behaved like that when

7089.56 --> 7094.119000000001
you were actually that age you'd

7091.48 --> 7096.119
probably be sent to the school doctor

7094.119 --> 7098.36
and be prescribed

7096.119 --> 7100.799999999999
math because you're acting like

7098.36 --> 7104.119
disruptive hyperactive people and it's

7100.8 --> 7104.119000000001
[ __ ] annoying

7123.239 --> 7129.079
yeah I'm sorry that I'm

7125.92 --> 7131.119
proving like your last seeds of doubt

7129.079 --> 7133.639
that you were desperately holding on to

7131.119 --> 7136.32
for your helos Centric marel I'm sorry

7133.639 --> 7140.079
that I just completely dispelled that

7136.32 --> 7144.119
last remaining seed of Hope for you I'm

7140.079 --> 7147.679
really sorry yeah Earth is [ __ ] flat

7144.119 --> 7147.679
get over it

7161.14 --> 7164.319
[Music]

7176.52 --> 7183.159000000001
yeah Lucy level but I mean that's what

7178.52 --> 7185.639
that is right Rin is basically

7183.159 --> 7187.0
math you have a bunch of hyperactive

7185.639 --> 7190.719
kids that

7187.0 --> 7193.04
just be loud and disruptive and like oh

7190.719 --> 7195.0
I want to have fun in the middle of an

7193.04 --> 7197.639
important learning moment which you're

7195.0 --> 7200.36
obviously having trouble with

7197.639 --> 7202.04
accepting if you kept doing that You'

7200.36 --> 7203.719
either be kicked out of school or just

7202.04 --> 7206.48
sent to the school doctor and they would

7203.719 --> 7208.4800000000005
say like yeah you're being disruptive

7206.48 --> 7211.799999999999
you need to learn to sit

7208.48 --> 7214.879999999999
still oh you don't want to okay well

7211.8 --> 7218.360000000001
then you're hyperactive here's your

7214.88 --> 7220.4800000000005
Redlin which is meth and it would

7218.36 --> 7223.199
probably work because if you're actually

7220.48 --> 7227.079
hyperactive then you calm down from that

7223.199 --> 7230.44
crap ralin is meth yeah yeah it is what

7227.079 --> 7237.159
you didn't know that you didn't know

7230.44 --> 7237.159
that yeah it's meth it's meth ralin is

7241.0 --> 7247.44
meth I'm really glad I never took it cuz

7245.159 --> 7247.44
it

7250.52 --> 7257.159000000001
sucks why not be a physics teacher

7253.96 --> 7259.96
because I refuse to teach Globe

7257.159 --> 7262.0
tardia which is required for the

7259.96 --> 7265.44
freaking curriculum of any physics

7262.0 --> 7268.28
teacher out there they're all forc

7265.44 --> 7270.799999999999
forced to teach Globe

7268.28 --> 7274.48
tardia that's

7270.8 --> 7278.4400000000005
why well not this teacher yeah I'll just

7274.48 --> 7281.678999999999
teach for free the real

7278.44 --> 7284.0
thing yeah I'd rather teach for free

7281.679 --> 7286.92
than have a paid job as a teacher

7284.0 --> 7289.159
teaching absolute [ __ ] to children

7286.92 --> 7292.36
that look up to

7289.159 --> 7294.239
you and because they trust you they're

7292.36 --> 7297.48
going to accept the propaganda you're

7294.239 --> 7297.48
forced to teach no

7298.32 --> 7302.92
thanks yeah and then oh well there's

7300.8 --> 7305.56
somebody that's catching on oh he'll

7302.92 --> 7307.719
just take them apart like on the side

7305.56 --> 7309.84
outside a class talk to them yeah and

7307.719 --> 7312.52
then you get some freaking Jew or a

7309.84 --> 7314.56
Freemason or some Jesuit walk up to you

7312.52 --> 7317.639
and threaten you like you never talk

7314.56 --> 7320.88
about that again or you're

7317.639 --> 7323.92
fired yeah and you'll never get a job

7320.88 --> 7327.719
again because that [ __ ] happens I've

7323.92 --> 7331.32
literally seen it I've seen that happen

7327.719 --> 7332.52
to people yeah that teacher that great

7331.32 --> 7335.599
physics

7332.52 --> 7337.76
teacher when eventually he took me on

7335.599 --> 7340.679
the side and started talking about this

7337.76 --> 7345.0
[ __ ] he was

7340.679 --> 7347.4800000000005
threatened he was afraid to talk to me

7345.0 --> 7350.159
separately from the class after that

7347.48 --> 7354.119
point because he got

7350.159 --> 7356.92
threatened and I was mortified over

7354.119 --> 7359.4
that that a teacher got threatened

7356.92 --> 7362.679
because he he wanted to teach me real

7359.4 --> 7364.92
things yeah that's this [ __ ] world we

7362.679 --> 7364.92
live

7365.48 --> 7372.0
in yeah that happened to me like when I

7367.92 --> 7374.76
was like 14 or something

7372.0 --> 7377.8
never forget that

7374.76 --> 7380.320000000001
[ __ ] yeah that's why I'm not a paid

7377.8 --> 7382.639
teacher in a school because then you

7380.32 --> 7387.04
have to teach everybody Globe [ __ ] and

7382.639 --> 7389.56
if you get real some scumbag [ __ ] is

7387.04 --> 7391.84
going to walk up to you from a bigger

7389.56 --> 7393.88
organization and threaten to ruin your

7391.84 --> 7397.159000000001
entire life just because you're trying

7393.88 --> 7400.32
to teach somebody the truth yeah I'm not

7397.159 --> 7403.32
doing that I'll just teach everybody for

7400.32 --> 7403.32
free

7403.4 --> 7409.48
and then hope to be able to get along

7405.96 --> 7412.32
get by from donations that are given

7409.48 --> 7414.759999999999
voluntarily yeah that's what I prefer to

7412.32 --> 7417.639
do even if that means dealing with

7414.76 --> 7421.719
shitty ass trolls that act like a bunch

7417.639 --> 7421.719
of hyperactive kids

7430.54 --> 7435.04
[Music]

7433.079 --> 7437.239
you are going to be a math professor

7435.04 --> 7441.84
nothing about the globe there yeah I'm

7437.239 --> 7445.28
sure it is it'll never no no Globe will

7441.84 --> 7449.679
ever be involved as a math teacher I'm

7445.28 --> 7449.679
sure yeah Kuma virus

7451.96 --> 7458.2390000000005
right a farm in a beekeeper oh that's

7454.88 --> 7458.2390000000005
pretty awesome luy

7460.119 --> 7465.96
level go to his house in the weekends

7463.159 --> 7465.96
okay that's a bit

7466.44 --> 7470.719
weird but yeah sounds

7474.48 --> 7478.718999999999
awesome what was he threatened

7479.44 --> 7486.199
for for hinting at information that

7482.679 --> 7486.1990000000005
Earth was actually measured

7486.92 --> 7491.84
flat basically for information that has

7489.719 --> 7494.199
been revealed like in the flatter Earth

7491.84 --> 7497.52
debates

7494.199 --> 7500.678999999999
development with Celestial

7497.52 --> 7504.040000000001
navigation mentioning that there's no

7500.679 --> 7508.559
Parallax within the star Mo all that all

7504.04 --> 7511.0
the real things all the the factual data

7508.559 --> 7513.559
yeah then he shared

7511.0 --> 7515.96
that and then he got threatened to be

7513.559 --> 7517.320000000001
fired over that if he ever talked about

7515.96 --> 7520.84
that

7517.32 --> 7523.639
again yeah through people that snitched

7520.84 --> 7523.639
on him

7523.92 --> 7531.079
in the class like

7528.079 --> 7534.759999999999
students taking notice of him saying

7531.079 --> 7537.679
those things telling it to their parents

7534.76 --> 7540.2390000000005
their parents contacting the school the

7537.679 --> 7542.76
school then directly threatening the

7540.239 --> 7545.959999999999
teacher we got complaints if you talk

7542.76 --> 7549.159000000001
about that you're fired yeah through

7545.96 --> 7550.119
[ __ ] students in the class snitching

7549.159 --> 7553.638999999999
on

7550.119 --> 7553.639
them yeah

7562.25 --> 7565.34
[Music]

7570.679 --> 7576.119
that's rough yeah it is [ __ ] rough

7573.199 --> 7576.119
it's a [ __ ]

7578.159 --> 7582.799999999999
nightmare

7579.719 --> 7585.119
yeah it's like waking up in Brave

7582.8 --> 7588.88
realizing that you're actually living in

7585.119 --> 7592.44
A Brave New World in that

7588.88 --> 7595.88
book like I was L I read that book and

7592.44 --> 7600.759999999999
made a report for it on in English

7595.88 --> 7603.400000000001
class which I like aced by the way yeah

7600.76 --> 7605.159000000001
and then during that school while I was

7603.4 --> 7608.239
reading that book and making a book

7605.159 --> 7611.079
report I figured out that that that that

7608.239 --> 7613.44
[ __ ] reality from that book is the

7611.079 --> 7615.719
reality I'm already living in it's like

7613.44 --> 7618.239
all just being

7615.719 --> 7619.559
camouflaged just being camouflaged and

7618.239 --> 7622.959999999999
kept from you that you're being

7619.559 --> 7625.679
indoctrinated with lies and I was

7622.96 --> 7628.4
unfortunate enough to be smart enough to

7625.679 --> 7631.079
catch onto that while it was

7628.4 --> 7633.679
happening so that I would be subjected

7631.079 --> 7636.04
to the realization that [ __ ] reality

7633.679 --> 7639.639
is a nightmare of

7636.04 --> 7643.44
Lies with hellish people that literally

7639.639 --> 7644.96
knowingly gatekeep the truth out of out

7643.44 --> 7647.719
of teaching

7644.96 --> 7650.28
yeah that's this [ __ ] world and I

7647.719 --> 7654.639
[ __ ] figured it out as a teenager and

7650.28 --> 7658.199
it wrecked me wrecked me made me

7654.639 --> 7661.4800000000005
dislocate with society never being

7658.199 --> 7663.36
capable of figuring out what kind of job

7661.48 --> 7667.04
what kind of profession I want because

7663.36 --> 7667.04
of that crap

7668.1 --> 7671.209000000001
[Music]

7674.079 --> 7682.0
cuz every option available would all be

7677.719 --> 7685.32
a trap a trap made with

7682.0 --> 7686.599
lies and you forced to oh you want to

7685.32 --> 7688.28
get good at this you want to get good at

7686.599 --> 7691.92
a career you want to get famous well

7688.28 --> 7693.44
then you have to lie you have to lie

7691.92 --> 7696.28
yeah that's what I figured out as a

7693.44 --> 7700.678999999999
young teenager and it wrecked

7696.28 --> 7702.159
me it made me dislocate with Society

7700.679 --> 7705.32
permanently

7702.159 --> 7710.5199999999995
I've never recovered I'm 44 years old

7705.32 --> 7710.5199999999995
I've never recovered from that in 30

7717.39 --> 7720.459000000001
[Music]

7720.76 --> 7726.1990000000005
years and I didn't even know the Earth

7723.32 --> 7728.5199999999995
was flat I just had weird hints at that

7726.199 --> 7730.32
there's something weird going on I just

7728.52 --> 7732.52
wanted to know what's the physical

7730.32 --> 7734.28
reality around me

7732.52 --> 7736.280000000001
I wasn't even thinking of like Earth

7734.28 --> 7738.679
being flat I was just thinking like

7736.28 --> 7741.88
maybe it's a weird interdimensional

7738.679 --> 7743.96
thing or whatever or like we're inside a

7741.88 --> 7746.719
cube that's

7743.96 --> 7750.559
like I was just

7746.719 --> 7753.32
like it seems there's information being

7750.559 --> 7756.360000000001
covered up about physical

7753.32 --> 7760.04
reality I wasn't like oh oh we're on a

7756.36 --> 7764.679
flat Earth disc with a doom I wasn't

7760.04 --> 7766.92
like I I wasn't even interested in that

7764.679 --> 7769.84
I wasn't even trying to like oh I want

7766.92 --> 7772.36
to figure out how it's a flat Earth disc

7769.84 --> 7775.119000000001
under a dome I was just like there's

7772.36 --> 7777.598999999999
information being covered up PE teachers

7775.119 --> 7779.799999999999
are getting threatened for telling

7777.599 --> 7783.0
certain things that's

7779.8 --> 7785.679
insane that's [ __ ] creepy that's

7783.0 --> 7785.679
creepy as

7787.84 --> 7792.719
hell yeah and I would just thought like

7790.28 --> 7795.36
wow is this real reality like a giant

7792.719 --> 7797.88
holidex super surreal

7795.36 --> 7800.36
situation like maybe we're like all

7797.88 --> 7803.32
living in a freaking bar

7800.36 --> 7804.5199999999995
Cube like maybe we're all living in a

7803.32 --> 7807.5199999999995
bar

7804.52 --> 7810.280000000001
Cube and and this experience is just

7807.52 --> 7812.1990000000005
like the Matrix even though the Matrix

7810.28 --> 7814.32
the movie hadn't even come out yet yeah

7812.199 --> 7815.079
I was already thinking like that when I

7814.32 --> 7818.48
was

7815.079 --> 7820.32
14 because of those experiences like

7818.48 --> 7822.199
there's something really freaky and

7820.32 --> 7825.159
surreal happening in

7822.199 --> 7828.44
reality Dark World Visions started to

7825.159 --> 7833.28
come forth with another parallel dream

7828.44 --> 7838.04
world where I was trying to figure this

7833.28 --> 7838.04
out and then everything really became

7847.88 --> 7855.84
crazy yeah but yeah okay I'm dislocated

7852.32 --> 7857.84
from society oh goody Well turns out

7855.84 --> 7859.96
society's pretty [ __ ] and now I'm

7857.84 --> 7864.0
continually thinking like what would

7859.96 --> 7867.8
have happened if I'd given up so I like

7864.0 --> 7873.96
oh no I have to adapt I I can't think

7867.8 --> 7876.400000000001
for myself anymore dude I'd freaking be

7873.96 --> 7879.8
dead I'd be dead

7876.4 --> 7882.799999999999
now yeah I would have died three years

7879.8 --> 7885.84
ago

7882.8 --> 7889.84
if I had done that and you could all

7885.84 --> 7889.84
guess why I would have died three years

7894.639 --> 7900.639
ago because I would go along with

7898.04 --> 7903.88
everything then because what's holding

7900.639 --> 7906.679
me back of just surrendering to the

7903.88 --> 7909.2390000000005
group Spirit and just be the Forerunner

7906.679 --> 7912.76
the the brave courageous guy that's just

7909.239 --> 7914.919999999999
like oh Society needs to do this right

7912.76 --> 7917.2390000000005
because it's said somehow and I'm going

7914.92 --> 7919.1990000000005
to trust that whenever some top down

7917.239 --> 7921.119
order comes from some random place and

7919.199 --> 7923.199
we don't know who it's coming from that

7921.119 --> 7925.04
means that everybody must do that and

7923.199 --> 7927.799999999999
I'll be the Forerunner I'll be the brave

7925.04 --> 7929.719
guy that's like no don't worry guys just

7927.8 --> 7931.679
participate in the medical experiment

7929.719 --> 7933.8
it's good it's we all need this yeah I

7931.679 --> 7936.28
would have done that I'd be proudly

7933.8 --> 7939.04
doing that out of complete surrendering

7936.28 --> 7942.559
faith and then I would have died a

7939.04 --> 7944.48
horrible [ __ ] death

7942.559 --> 7946.92
just like so many other people that's

7944.48 --> 7948.5199999999995
exactly what would have happened if I

7946.92 --> 7951.52
had not

7948.52 --> 7954.96
resisted and dislocated myself from

7951.52 --> 7957.320000000001
society permanently at that age that's

7954.96 --> 7960.199
exactly what would have happened it

7957.32 --> 7964.558999999999
literally that vision of that happening

7960.199 --> 7967.678999999999
haunted me for 20 years like future

7964.559 --> 7970.639
fears of like I'm going to die from a

7967.679 --> 7973.84
medical experiment yeah I was terrified

7970.639 --> 7976.76
of dying from a medical experiment like

7973.84 --> 7976.76
in my early

7978.48 --> 7985.678999999999
20s because it would haunt me in my

7982.4 --> 7991.0
dreams literally in my dreams I was

7985.679 --> 7994.4800000000005
being confronted with how do I prevent

7991.0 --> 7997.96
being seduced from taking a medical

7994.48 --> 8001.28
experiment that's literally like like

7997.96 --> 8003.88
will literally make you no longer human

8001.28 --> 8007.0
that will take the the the the unique

8003.88 --> 8009.84
human spark out of

8007.0 --> 8012.0
you because I feared that I would be

8009.84 --> 8014.159000000001
seduced because it's like it would be

8012.0 --> 8017.719
encouraged as a group

8014.159 --> 8021.638999999999
dynamic to do that to be good person to

8017.719 --> 8024.8
be considered a good person was super

8021.639 --> 8028.04
[ __ ] addicting to me yeah super

8024.8 --> 8030.679
[ __ ] addicted like oh people tell you

8028.04 --> 8034.5199999999995
you're good if you do this dude I'll

8030.679 --> 8037.599
[ __ ] risk death just to do that yeah

8034.52 --> 8039.360000000001
that's the guy that I was hyper

8037.599 --> 8042.96
sensitive to group

8039.36 --> 8045.719
influence hyper sensitive to it if I

8042.96 --> 8050.559
hadn't dislocated from society this way

8045.719 --> 8054.639
I would be dead now I know I would

8050.559 --> 8058.360000000001
because I would have like loved to die

8054.639 --> 8062.96
just to be doing something that was told

8058.36 --> 8066.88
to me within the group dynamic yeah

8062.96 --> 8070.52
like that tendency like even almost got

8066.88 --> 8070.52
me killed at a younger

8070.719 --> 8075.96
age like you're in a group with just a

8073.679 --> 8078.84
bunch of kids they're going to be like

8075.96 --> 8081.679
who who dares to do this well guess what

8078.84 --> 8084.0
guess what here's our win here's our win

8081.679 --> 8086.96
oh the group you're going to be

8084.0 --> 8089.48
challenged for doing something to be a

8086.96 --> 8091.8
badass guess who's going to do that yeah

8089.48 --> 8094.759999999999
me I would do it even if it's [ __ ]

8091.8 --> 8096.8
insane even if it's humiliating because

8094.76 --> 8098.88
it was a challenge and I'm part of a

8096.8 --> 8101.1990000000005
group and when I'm in a part of a group

8098.88 --> 8106.159000000001
and I get a challenge I'm the one that

8101.199 --> 8108.239
would do it like a [ __ ] insane person

8106.159 --> 8111.0
cuz that's how sensitive to group

8108.239 --> 8113.678999999999
dynamics I am it's a [ __ ]

8111.0 --> 8116.079
nightmare if I hadn't actively and

8113.679 --> 8118.52
permanently dislocated myself in my

8116.079 --> 8122.96
teens and basically become a Hermit the

8118.52 --> 8122.96
rest of my life I would now be

8134.4 --> 8138.598999999999
dead and the devil knew

8140.199 --> 8145.36
it in my Visions he knew

8146.36 --> 8151.96
that been holding it over my head all

8149.48 --> 8155.44
you have to do is just become part of it

8151.96 --> 8157.28
again just Just Surrender like you don't

8155.44 --> 8160.839999999999
have to be alone

8157.28 --> 8165.759999999999
forever you can be praised by other

8160.84 --> 8167.719
humans for being an exemplary individual

8165.76 --> 8169.639
ironically be called individual even

8167.719 --> 8172.079
though it's barely an

8169.639 --> 8174.079
individual but you would be praised by

8172.079 --> 8177.48
everybody because I'd be such a

8174.079 --> 8182.119
forerunner I'd be so brave and

8177.48 --> 8184.919999999999
just like oh oh no no our country is

8182.119 --> 8187.32
threatened by a war we need volunteers

8184.92 --> 8190.4400000000005
to protect it oh guess who's going to be

8187.32 --> 8192.88
number one doing that that's me that's

8190.44 --> 8197.16
me I'll run straight into the

8192.88 --> 8199.438999999998
trenches why because the group demands

8197.16 --> 8201.96
it yeah that's

8199.439 --> 8205.16
me

8201.96 --> 8208.039999999999
dude if I hadn't become a [ __ ] hermit

8205.16 --> 8211.2
I would probably now be reporting to the

8208.04 --> 8214.639000000001
Department of Defense volunteering for

8211.2 --> 8214.639000000001
[ __ ] Ukraine

8214.88 --> 8217.88
now

8224.2 --> 8228.2
okay just the thought of

8230.719 --> 8235.358999999999
that makes me sick

8247.719 --> 8251.559
all right so yeah that's some

8252.519 --> 8258.679
uh some personal stuff I'm sharing here

8256.479 --> 8261.119999999999
but now you

8258.679 --> 8263.679
know and you also know that I've been

8261.12 --> 8265.76
extremely consistent so yeah I mean

8263.679 --> 8268.08
everything I'm saying all matches

8265.76 --> 8271.04
everything that I've ever said and done

8268.08 --> 8274.12
on my show cuz this is real this is how

8271.04 --> 8278.559000000001
I work I'm hyper sensitive to group

8274.12 --> 8282.359
dynamic I always have to actively reject

8278.559 --> 8284.199999999999
group dynamic even when I'm in a group

8282.359 --> 8286.04
when I'm in a group it's like I'm

8284.2 --> 8290.800000000001
surrounded by the devil that is

8286.04 --> 8290.800000000001
continually seducing me and it's really

8292.92 --> 8298.439
seductive

8294.639 --> 8301.639
yeah I mean I feel like Gandalf

8298.439 --> 8304.319
sometimes and like Frodo is just

8301.639 --> 8306.279999999999
continually trying to give me the ring

8304.319 --> 8308.599
whenever I'm in a group with group

8306.28 --> 8310.359
dynamic it's like there's just froo

8308.599 --> 8312.519
there just trying to give me the ring

8310.359 --> 8315.28
they telling me like take it take it

8312.519 --> 8318.519
like all the [ __ ] time any group

8315.28 --> 8322.439
dynamic it it's just always happening I

8318.519 --> 8324.800000000001
always have to be hyper Vigilant like I

8322.439 --> 8326.92
can't give into the group dynamic I

8324.8 --> 8330.599
can't give into the group dynamic

8326.92 --> 8333.960000000001
because that's instantaneous hell for me

8330.599 --> 8333.960000000001
that that's where I Lose My

8339.88 --> 8345.92
Soul yeah and it's part of the reason

8342.679 --> 8348.28
why I left fed because they were like

8345.92 --> 8351.08
literally becoming like Frodo like that

8348.28 --> 8354.399000000001
they were literally forcing like like

8351.08 --> 8357.559
you have to be that group dynamic and

8354.399 --> 8359.96
I'm like I can't do it anymore man I'm

8357.559 --> 8362.679
starting to hallucinate from the strain

8359.96 --> 8365.08
of this

8362.679 --> 8368.76
I can't do it

8365.08 --> 8368.76
anymore I can't

8369.12 --> 8378.28
be forced to to be that group dynamic I

8373.96 --> 8381.479
can't do it I can't do it I can't do

8378.28 --> 8384.679
it why are you trying to force me to do

8381.479 --> 8387.639
that I can't do it I can't do it why

8384.679 --> 8389.64
aren't you listening to my warnings that

8387.639 --> 8392.599999999999
I can't do

8389.64 --> 8396.76
it warnings that I've given out over

8392.6 --> 8399.2
years and that were 100% ignored even

8396.76 --> 8403.439
like whether I I was sharing it calmly

8399.2 --> 8408.399000000001
or yelling it at them it was

8403.439 --> 8408.399
ignored I had to leave and I can't go

8412.24 --> 8416.359
back it's not because of an

8416.72 --> 8421.92
individual it's because of the group

8418.92 --> 8424.6
dynamic ex the group Dynamic

8421.92 --> 8427.92
exclusively it's like the devil is the

8424.6 --> 8430.479000000001
group dynamic it is to me and they might

8427.92 --> 8433.319
all be thriving there they might all be

8430.479 --> 8435.519999999999
like having that part that they always

8433.319 --> 8438.76
longed for and needed and it just works

8435.52 --> 8441.720000000001
great well it does not work great for me

8438.76 --> 8444.319
to me it's just freaking froto telling

8441.72 --> 8445.96
me take the ring take it take it take it

8444.319 --> 8450.479
yeah that's what that is to me that's

8445.96 --> 8450.479
the [ __ ] group dynamic to me

8470.52 --> 8472.84
good

8473.28 --> 8478.359
reference is literally like that Richard

8475.84 --> 8481.56
G it is literally like that I mean

8478.359 --> 8484.319
people underestimate that that moment in

8481.56 --> 8487.56
the movie Lord of the Rings when Frodo

8484.319 --> 8490.88
like desperately tries to give out of

8487.56 --> 8493.6
fear tries to give gandal of the Ring

8490.88 --> 8496.8
people underestimate that like how

8493.6 --> 8498.640000000001
terrifying terrible that moment was like

8496.8 --> 8502.0
the entire world could have been

8498.64 --> 8505.479
destroyed if gandal in that moment

8502.0 --> 8508.76
wasn't strong enough to say

8505.479 --> 8511.88
no in that one moment like even more

8508.76 --> 8514.2
than the time when when Gad was seduced

8511.88 --> 8518.24
if gandal had given

8514.2 --> 8518.240000000002
in it would have all been

8519.16 --> 8523.16
destroyed yeah

8541.93 --> 8545.04
[Music]

8549.76 --> 8557.54
right but you can thank ill andal that

8553.56 --> 8560.649
Gandalf did not take that ring in that

8557.54 --> 8560.649000000001
[Music]

8567.479 --> 8571.679999999998
moment all right yeah thanks losy level

8570.52 --> 8574.6
have a great

8571.68 --> 8577.800000000001
day it's been a good show surprisingly

8574.6 --> 8581.640000000001
it started out really trollish but it's

8577.8 --> 8581.64
pretty cool it's been

8590.12 --> 8596.84
interesting tile

8592.84 --> 8596.84
building what

8602.8 --> 8607.479
all right I have no idea what you guys

8604.399 --> 8610.119999999999
have been talking about in the last 15

8607.479 --> 8612.039999999999
minutes or something it was just way too

8610.12 --> 8616.560000000001
zoned

8612.04 --> 8616.560000000001
in into trying to explain

8623.76 --> 8629.12
this all

8626.319 --> 8631.24
right and also you got to realize that

8629.12 --> 8633.92
with everything that I explained like I

8631.24 --> 8637.319
was trying

8633.92 --> 8639.52
trying she's trying but I was trying to

8637.319 --> 8642.0
even explain this to my parents at the

8639.52 --> 8646.279
time and like they it was over their

8642.0 --> 8649.2
heads okay that's how terrifying the

8646.279 --> 8651.84
entire situation was I'm a teenager I'm

8649.2 --> 8655.04
figuring this [ __ ] out and it's just

8651.84 --> 8656.880000000001
over their heads not necessarily over

8655.04 --> 8660.160000000002
their heads about Flat Earth they were

8656.88 --> 8663.0
like oh yeah maybe it is flat who knows

8660.16 --> 8667.399
right very open-minded very liberal in a

8663.0 --> 8670.279
good way but that that thing that that

8667.399 --> 8672.56
the teacher would just be almost fired

8670.279 --> 8676.52
because they just told the truth to

8672.56 --> 8679.359
me like my parents did not know how to

8676.52 --> 8682.52
respond to that at all they were

8679.359 --> 8685.880000000001
terrified of that to the point where

8682.52 --> 8688.720000000001
they didn't even give any comments on it

8685.88 --> 8692.119999999999
okay now imagine trying to have to deal

8688.72 --> 8696.199999999999
with that when you're 14

8692.12 --> 8699.560000000001
yeah when you're smart and liberal

8696.2 --> 8703.319000000001
thinking and like have honoring ancient

8699.56 --> 8705.359
wisdom parents like don't know how to

8703.319 --> 8707.56
respond at something that's happening to

8705.359 --> 8712.720000000001
you in your life because they're

8707.56 --> 8712.72
terrified imagine what that's like

8728.64 --> 8732.278999999999
or just follow whatever the chat is

8730.56 --> 8737.16
talking about

8732.279 --> 8742.76
and don't don't consider what I just

8737.16 --> 8742.76

support for my efforts

8861.76 --> 8868.72
the Tils are made for yeah fiber outs I

8864.479 --> 8871.479
mean those re-entry burning tiles are

8868.72 --> 8873.119999999999
made of certain type a ceramic because

8871.479 --> 8878.039999999999
that's the only thing that can take that

8873.12 --> 8878.04
heat for a prolong time ceramics

8904.479 --> 8907.92
I don't know about that fiber

8908.8 --> 8914.88
outs I don't see why you have to be so

8912.12 --> 8914.880000000001
suspicious of

8925.399 --> 8930.8
Lucy she's been around for a while

8948.0 --> 8951.84
okay Luci level well let me tell you

8950.92 --> 8955.76
it's

8951.84 --> 8958.52
Ceramics yeah that's the reentry burning

8955.76 --> 8960.880000000001
tiles heat absorption that's all

8958.52 --> 8962.16
Ceramics I just happened to know

8960.88 --> 8967.92
[Music]

8962.16 --> 8973.56
that cuz I was really interested in all

8967.92 --> 8973.56
that huge space fan best entertainment

8982.68 --> 8988.64
ever don't everything no

8992.279 --> 8998.0
you don't have to doubt logic don't have

8994.88 --> 9002.119999999999
to doubt things that

8998.0 --> 9002.12
are just

9002.68 --> 9006.08
provable through

9007.72 --> 9012.0
empiricism right and hey you can doubt

9010.0 --> 9016.479
Flat Earth all you like but I mean the

9012.0 --> 9016.479
geometric orientation of the Earth is

9017.12 --> 9023.2
flat yeah there's no signs whatsoever

9020.12 --> 9027.84
there's any form of

9023.2 --> 9031.439
curvature concave or

9027.84 --> 9031.439
convex in any

9043.6 --> 9050.12
way what are you talking about

9047.16 --> 9053.76
fibs just could you just leave loose

9050.12 --> 9055.800000000001
level alone like yeah sure it's a troll

9053.76 --> 9059.56
or whatever but I

9055.8 --> 9062.8
mean it's one of the least tedious

9059.56 --> 9064.68
trolls thus far if she is so could you

9062.8 --> 9068.679999999998
just

9064.68 --> 9068.68

you got some kind of injury you're

9242.72 --> 9245.358999999999
taking like

9248.68 --> 9253.52
a or is it a cortisol shot or

9257.16 --> 9264.319
something for like the

9262.12 --> 9267.160000000002
healing don't know if that's actually

9264.319 --> 9269.16
something people do I vaguely remember

9267.16 --> 9271.0
my brother having taken some of that

9269.16 --> 9275.359
because he had shoulder

9271.0 --> 9275.359
issues being like a hobbyist

9275.399 --> 9283.399
climber torn rotator cuff right steroid

9279.2 --> 9283.399000000001
inject oh right okay

9293.84 --> 9299.64
yeah that

9294.88 --> 9303.64
sucks rotator cuff that's very sensitive

9299.64 --> 9303.64
I really hope it heals up all

9310.12 --> 9315.52
right right you definitely want to avoid

9312.76 --> 9315.52
surgery with

9316.88 --> 9323.759999999998
that hurts like a [ __ ] right

9320.84 --> 9326.24
right I wish you could like redirect

9323.76 --> 9329.92
some of that pain through magnet

9326.24 --> 9329.92
magnetization as I would do

9345.12 --> 9351.960000000001
it [ __ ] off L level no they don't do

9349.16 --> 9351.96
that that's that's

9352.8 --> 9356.16
ridiculous and

9362.56 --> 9368.84
criminal like they can't put it in there

9365.68 --> 9368.84
that stuff doesn't

9374.68 --> 9382.08
mix yeah it's not like it's just CA it's

9379.76 --> 9384.52
not like it's vitamin C that you can

9382.08 --> 9386.24
just like oh it just put some vitamin C

9384.52 --> 9389.720000000001
alongside whatever you were going to

9386.24 --> 9392.52
inject like no no it's a very delicate

9389.72 --> 9394.84
set of weird ass chemicals you can't

9392.52 --> 9399.399000000001
just mix that up with steroids and then

9394.84 --> 9399.399
expect that to work no they don't do

9404.68 --> 9411.279
that yeah the medical experimentation

9407.76 --> 9414.479
shots are like really delicate chemical

9411.279 --> 9417.6
type stuff if you

9414.479 --> 9422.278999999999
like leave it out in the heat for too

9417.6 --> 9426.16
long it completely like yeah

9422.279 --> 9428.800000000001
becomes weird and Alters it's a very

9426.16 --> 9430.8
weird [ __ ] it's not like

9428.8 --> 9432.84
vitamins yeah the medical

9430.8 --> 9434.92
experimentation that's like a really

9432.84 --> 9437.76
weird ass

9434.92 --> 9440.72
delicate insane

9437.76 --> 9443.319
procedure that has like very specific

9440.72 --> 9444.8
conditions it have to be kept cool and

9443.319 --> 9446.88
all these things that are really

9444.8 --> 9449.438999999998
required you can't just mix it in with

9446.88 --> 9450.8
something else that it doesn't work like

9449.439 --> 9456.08
that at

9450.8 --> 9456.08
all so they don't do that

9476.479 --> 9480.88
it says not to get any medical

9478.399 --> 9483.84
experimentation while doing it dude

9480.88 --> 9486.88
every procedure should say that like all

9483.84 --> 9491.12
the time like oh when you're doing this

9486.88 --> 9494.519999999999
don't do that like when doing anything

9491.12 --> 9496.76
don't don't engage in any medical

9494.52 --> 9500.640000000001
experimentation like this should just

9496.76 --> 9500.64
when doing anything

9505.399 --> 9508.399
ah

9540.0 --> 9545.6
all weird left arm issues I that's weird

9542.96 --> 9548.759999999998
I got weird left arm issues but it's not

9545.6 --> 9551.439
like rotatory I mean thank God this is

9548.76 --> 9553.16
working just fine but I do have issues

9551.439 --> 9557.279
like on the left

9553.16 --> 9560.56
side I have to like massage it sometimes

9557.279 --> 9560.560000000001
it's weird

9563.439 --> 9567.2
always have issues on the left side and

9565.479 --> 9568.24
not so much on the right side that's

9567.2 --> 9571.08
very

9568.24 --> 9573.439
rare even though this is definitely my

9571.08 --> 9573.439
stronger

9574.09 --> 9580.279
[Music]

9577.68 --> 9583.16
arm but because I'm just always

9580.279 --> 9585.560000000001
massaging my left side my left side is

9583.16 --> 9587.359
like more flexible than my right side my

9585.56 --> 9589.039999999999
right side's stronger my left side's

9587.359 --> 9590.359
more flexible it's kind of weird that

9589.04 --> 9594.640000000001
way

9590.359 --> 9594.640000000001
but it can be extremely useful

9620.96 --> 9628.199999999999
pain to get off what do you mean to get

9625.52 --> 9631.880000000001
off why would it be a pain to get off

9628.2 --> 9631.880000000001
you just stop taking

9635.04 --> 9642.12
it all right see you later

9638.88 --> 9643.88
Lucy take it

9642.12 --> 9647.279
easy right I'm going to take a

9643.88 --> 9647.278999999999
two-minute break I'll be right

9648.24 --> 9652.279
back for

9738.16 --> 9742.16
e e

9743.75 --> 9746.87
[Music]

9783.359 --> 9785.960000000001
okay and I'm

9788.8 --> 9791.869999999999
[Music]

9792.68 --> 9799.359
back there are sign effects to getting

9795.279 --> 9799.359
off them oh okay

9814.64 --> 9821.68
I I was not fully aware of that I never

9818.12 --> 9826.52
had issues I've never had any kind of

9821.68 --> 9826.52
steroids that I'm aware of

9848.72 --> 9855.64
but I mean to be fair I've never really

9851.04 --> 9858.52
been wounded except for my earlier teen

9855.64 --> 9859.56
years like I've just never sustained

9858.52 --> 9861.279
actual

9859.56 --> 9862.8
after

9861.279 --> 9865.92
that

9862.8 --> 9868.319
just as a kid and as a teenager I was

9865.92 --> 9872.8
kind of like Reckless about

9868.319 --> 9874.76
things not overly Reckless but Reckless

9872.8 --> 9878.039999999999
enough to actually get

9874.76 --> 9880.68
hurt but then eventually when I figured

9878.04 --> 9882.880000000001
out that how [ __ ] up the world is and

9880.68 --> 9885.359
that you can't really trust anybody

9882.88 --> 9888.479
because we're being taught lies and

9885.359 --> 9890.16
there's an evil system then I realized

9888.479 --> 9892.88
like yeah

9890.16 --> 9896.039999999999
getting wounded is a great opportunity

9892.88 --> 9900.24
for these people to like implant you

9896.04 --> 9905.2
with sensors and tracking systems

9900.24 --> 9909.88
and weird ass behavioral manipulation

9905.2 --> 9912.800000000001
devices and so then I realized like

9909.88 --> 9915.8
yeah I just have to make sure that I

9912.8 --> 9920.96
never ever get in an accident

9915.8 --> 9920.96
ever and I didn't after that point

9921.92 --> 9926.24
I was never Reckless again because I

9924.479 --> 9929.679999999998
realized how dangerous that could

9926.24 --> 9929.68
actually be

9962.399 --> 9965.399
shot

9966.399 --> 9972.08
this after your cat

9969.439 --> 9974.68
accident okay I thought that could have

9972.08 --> 9976.56
been a cat accident I mean if a cat goes

9974.68 --> 9980.76
all foaming at the mouth and just

9976.56 --> 9983.16
scratches the [ __ ] out of you

9980.76 --> 9986.56
completely scratched like you might need

9983.16 --> 9986.56
a that in a shot after

9987.56 --> 9993.399
that but I guess a car accident could be

9991.0 --> 9993.399
pretty

10000.2 --> 10005.560000000001
dangerous that's

10002.64 --> 10010.599999999999
rabies yeah but I mean if it's like in a

10005.56 --> 10012.8
Dusty area and the cat's just like dirty

10010.6 --> 10015.92
well you might need tanus

10012.8 --> 10019.519999999999
too cuz it's all about that those weird

10015.92 --> 10019.52
ass spores that are in the

10026.2 --> 10032.960000000001
dust rusted Metals

10030.96 --> 10036.039999999999
yeah

10032.96 --> 10038.08
allegedly tetanus is like spores that

10036.04 --> 10040.560000000001
are in the dust that's how I was taught

10038.08 --> 10043.399
about it I mean

10040.56 --> 10046.56
I don't know though in

10043.399 --> 10049.599999999999
retrospect a lot of disease and claims

10046.56 --> 10053.199999999999
on how you get it are

10049.6 --> 10055.84
like more correlation than causation

10053.2 --> 10059.359
like there's so many things that you can

10055.84 --> 10061.880000000001
get that are that I just have like what

10059.359 --> 10065.439
the hell is that I mean sure there is

10061.88 --> 10067.679999999998
something there but is it really based

10065.439 --> 10070.0
on the model that they claim how it

10067.68 --> 10073.800000000001
works

10070.0 --> 10073.8
I not so damn sure

10077.08 --> 10084.479
anymore I mean viruses literally don't

10081.12 --> 10088.640000000001
exist it can't be

10084.479 --> 10090.84
that there might be some spores involved

10088.64 --> 10095.439
sure I mean

10090.84 --> 10096.439
spores can be like bacteria can be like

10095.439 --> 10101.0
blood

10096.439 --> 10103.479000000001
platelets so there might something there

10101.0 --> 10107.96
I just don't really know the true nature

10103.479 --> 10107.96
now of tanus like what the hell is

10112.24 --> 10118.84
that but it all it seems to always be

10115.479 --> 10124.199999999999
involving open wounds like the danger of

10118.84 --> 10128.16
tetus for some reason is about open

10124.2 --> 10130.08
wounds and dirt getting in it especially

10128.16 --> 10133.92
in hot

10130.08 --> 10136.0
Dusty places for some reason that's a

10133.92 --> 10138.92
risk for

10136.0 --> 10142.359
tetanus if you get wounded in like a a

10138.92 --> 10145.16
moist area there apparently is no danger

10142.359 --> 10145.16
like that at

10146.319 --> 10153.92
all and I don't know

10150.6 --> 10155.880000000001
why except for the model that they tell

10153.92 --> 10157.84
you why and that is that oh there's the

10155.88 --> 10159.56
spores and they flow around in this dust

10157.84 --> 10161.6
and the Spore could get in the wound and

10159.56 --> 10166.239
then you can get

10161.6 --> 10168.359
tetus okay if you say so I don't know if

10166.239 --> 10171.08
that actually

10168.359 --> 10176.04
true I mean was there

10171.08 --> 10179.12
actual C postulate tests done with

10176.04 --> 10181.640000000001
that I mean have they actually isolated

10179.12 --> 10183.880000000001
these tetanus spores that are supposedly

10181.64 --> 10186.519999999999
causing that did they then manage to

10183.88 --> 10190.319
actually have those isolated spores

10186.52 --> 10193.460000000001
directly cause tatus in a

10190.319 --> 10196.66
I don't know if they even did

10193.46 --> 10196.66
[Music]

10199.279 --> 10205.16
that Arin you sure you're not a

10203.6 --> 10208.04
doctor

10205.16 --> 10212.119999999999
uh

10208.04 --> 10212.12
what I'm a doctor to

10212.359 --> 10218.0
myself I'm My Own doctor I'm My Own

10215.0 --> 10218.0
psychologist

10221.88 --> 10226.479
I'm basically my own healthc care

10224.16 --> 10228.96
professional that's what I

10226.479 --> 10230.72
am in all

10228.96 --> 10234.16
directions

10230.72 --> 10236.88
and hey I'm not a doctor though and if I

10234.16 --> 10239.96
give medical advice I have to tell you

10236.88 --> 10242.08
like hey uh yeah this might sound super

10239.96 --> 10244.319
reasonable very well

10242.08 --> 10246.479
formulated even with some background

10244.319 --> 10250.119999999999
research and references but yeah I'm

10246.479 --> 10253.76
technically not a doctor

10250.12 --> 10256.399000000001
so yeah whenever you do it whatever

10253.76 --> 10259.0
happens you can't then afterwards say

10256.399 --> 10262.8
but a doctor told me that this would

10259.0 --> 10262.8
work CU I'm not a

10263.0 --> 10269.239
doctor I'm arguably better than a doctor

10266.04 --> 10271.439
in my opinion because I prefer to take

10269.239 --> 10272.6
my own advice than to take an advice of

10271.439 --> 10278.479000000001
the average

10272.6 --> 10278.479000000001
doctor which I usually don't consult

10278.8 --> 10283.96
or basically never consult I haven't

10281.84 --> 10288.399
consulted a

10283.96 --> 10292.679999999998
doctor since I was 23 I

10288.399 --> 10294.92
think I've consulted my dad a lot

10292.68 --> 10298.04
though but that's because he had a lot

10294.92 --> 10303.0
of alternative medical insights and

10298.04 --> 10303.0
treatments for things for ailments so

10309.56 --> 10315.0
found in soil

10312.359 --> 10317.68
Ash Ash

10315.0 --> 10320.6
what

10317.68 --> 10323.6
rusted skin

10320.6 --> 10323.6
Serv

10327.64 --> 10335.479
what how the hell would it be in Ash

10330.96 --> 10335.479
that makes no damn sense Ash is like

10335.72 --> 10340.519999999999
completely like sterilized

10341.56 --> 10348.119999999999
how the [ __ ] can

10344.6 --> 10351.0
Ash create teus that makes no sense to

10348.12 --> 10351.0
me akumu

10355.68 --> 10361.0
virus unless tetanus is actually a form

10359.319 --> 10364.64
of

10361.0 --> 10369.2
poisoning that causes these symptoms and

10364.64 --> 10372.56
not an organism based disease at all oh

10369.2 --> 10372.560000000001
as they said oh it's

10372.68 --> 10379.239
spores so is it a poisonous a poison

10376.16 --> 10382.2
based condition actually

10379.239 --> 10384.64
teus because I mean Ash is freaking

10382.2 --> 10387.720000000001
sterile it's it's like it's

10384.64 --> 10390.0
burnt things that are burned are

10387.72 --> 10395.72
sterile how the hell is that going to

10390.0 --> 10395.72
cause a infection that's very strange

10403.04 --> 10406.2
the rust I get

10406.52 --> 10414.12
though although not directly why but

10409.92 --> 10419.479
it's just like getting a rust yeah

10414.12 --> 10419.479000000001
rusted wound from a rusted nail is like

10423.239 --> 10429.119999999999
dangerous but I I don't exactly

10426.399 --> 10430.76
understand why though

10429.12 --> 10434.12
it would be kind of interesting to

10430.76 --> 10438.16
figure out why why what's actually going

10434.12 --> 10441.359
on there dude like the whole medical

10438.16 --> 10445.08
world just needs to be like refigured

10441.359 --> 10447.399000000001
out I mean we know like oh this

10445.08 --> 10450.439
correlates with that and that and that

10447.399 --> 10453.039999999999
that's what causes this thing but what

10450.439 --> 10455.6
the [ __ ] is actually what is that thing

10453.04 --> 10458.960000000001
actually like what's actually

10455.6 --> 10462.08
happening why why those things why do

10458.96 --> 10464.278999999999
those things cause that that needs to be

10462.08 --> 10468.0
reassessed like with

10464.279 --> 10468.0
everything absolutely

10484.72 --> 10489.92
everything are you trying to be

10486.76 --> 10492.76
sarcastic marxy

10489.92 --> 10496.8
because it just makes me pissed off at

10492.76 --> 10496.800000000001
you don't know if that's what you're

10517.319 --> 10523.479
after what the [ __ ] are you what do you

10519.96 --> 10526.919999999998
mean wrap it up hey Moxy [ __ ] this is

10523.479 --> 10526.92
not your [ __ ] show

10547.239 --> 10551.279
[ __ ] for

10580.279 --> 10586.319000000001
right anyway almost hitting the thre

10583.0 --> 10589.84
hour mark all right children no no just

10586.319 --> 10592.319
stop talking Moxy just stop

10589.84 --> 10594.0
talking you're you're going over lines

10592.319 --> 10598.88
that you shouldn't go over and there's

10594.0 --> 10598.88
no damn reason for you to do that anyway

10609.2 --> 10614.16
other than you potentially being an

10611.279 --> 10617.92
unstable [ __ ] that just randomly gets

10614.16 --> 10617.92
nasty out of nothing

10649.399 --> 10654.119999999999
all right but I think it's been a very

10650.96 --> 10656.16
good show overall very interesting

10654.12 --> 10660.2
subjects I mean Today's Show is

10656.16 --> 10663.8
definitely a show I'd like to share with

10660.2 --> 10666.0
people like for example Crow I

10663.8 --> 10669.199999999999
definitely be like hey Crow you want a

10666.0 --> 10670.96
an average show that's actually good

10669.2 --> 10674.84
take this

10670.96 --> 10677.358999999999
one it's a good indicator of like what I

10674.84 --> 10679.6
talk about on on the level like this is

10677.359 --> 10679.6
the

10680.479 --> 10687.278999999999
level this is a good sample of a quality

10690.92 --> 10695.479
show you have something on I don't know

10693.96 --> 10698.358999999999
what the hell you're talking about

10695.479 --> 10703.039999999999
whatever

10698.359 --> 10703.04
you go do whatever you like marxy

10755.04 --> 10759.880000000001
okay go virus

10758.239 --> 10762.68
whatever that

10759.88 --> 10767.278999999999
means all right anyway guys don't forget

10762.68 --> 10767.279
to Rogan up the show come

10769.04 --> 10773.84
on there's 30 watching

10811.6 --> 10815.479000000001
all right I think I'm going to round out

10813.96 --> 10819.16
the

10815.479 --> 10822.278999999999
show it's been good but uh yeah maybe I

10819.16 --> 10825.0
just want to round out on a high end

10822.279 --> 10827.16
before things get all diluted and

10825.0 --> 10830.96
pointless again people just talk

10827.16 --> 10833.399
[ __ ] in my chat about absolute

10830.96 --> 10835.72
nonsense because that is usually what

10833.399 --> 10838.88
you guys end up doing and I'd like to

10835.72 --> 10842.519999999999
avoid that segment right and we have

10838.88 --> 10844.759999999998
we've had tons of subjects tons of

10842.52 --> 10846.84
different subjects and it's been good

10844.76 --> 10849.800000000001
and I'd like to round it out on that

10846.84 --> 10851.880000000001
high note so thanks everyone for coming

10849.8 --> 10854.16
I hope you like this show if you did

10886.68 --> 10890.0
then I have a good show and I still

10888.279 --> 10893.239
don't get any support that kind of

10890.0 --> 10896.0
pisses me off again yeah it's not

10893.239 --> 10899.52
helping to stabilize the average mood

10896.0 --> 10903.04
that I have during my show yeah so uh

10899.52 --> 10905.2
