101.92 --> 106.159
so the way the weather today is

106.24 --> 109.52
quite astonishing

109.84 --> 112.84
like

114.079 --> 118.55999999999999
even more amazing than yesterday it's so

116.159 --> 120.71900000000001
clear blue

118.56 --> 123.04
look just a

120.719 --> 125.03999999999999
tiny bunch of clouds over there that

123.04 --> 126.84
kind of look gray by the way that's

125.04 --> 128.479
weird

126.84 --> 131.03900000000002
but

128.479 --> 131.92000000000002
it's super clear blue and

131.039 --> 134.0
yeah

131.92 --> 136.879
it really stood out to me i was outside

134.0 --> 138.56
smoking checking out the sky

136.879 --> 140.64
absorbing the sun

138.56 --> 142.959
i'm seeing a whole bunch of planes like

140.64 --> 144.95899999999997
even now

142.959 --> 146.48
see one over there one over there but

144.959 --> 147.599
there were like

146.48 --> 149.92
i saw

147.599 --> 151.28
i think it must be like four or five in

149.92 --> 153.11999999999998
one view

151.28 --> 155.599
and none of them

153.12 --> 158.8
are leaving trails

155.599 --> 161.04
it's all like that one a contrail they

158.8 --> 162.959
dissipate

161.04 --> 164.48
so for some reason today there's no

162.959 --> 167.84
spray

164.48 --> 167.84
oh look there's an actual

167.92 --> 172.79999999999998
personal plane with a banner behind it

170.319 --> 175.67999999999998
flying over there huh

172.8 --> 175.68
just pick that up

178.159 --> 184.12
i can't read it though from this

181.12 --> 184.12
distance

185.84 --> 189.20000000000002
anyway yeah beautiful

189.599 --> 193.599
blue skies and

191.84 --> 197.4
barely wind

193.599 --> 197.39999999999998
and the sun is just

198.56 --> 204.48
gorgeous and yeah noticing like even

200.959 --> 204.48
birds are just sitting

204.64 --> 211.319
on chimneys and in trees just like

207.44 --> 211.319
absorbing the sun

213.04 --> 216.879
hello gadget inspector first in chat

215.44 --> 220.12
good to see you

216.879 --> 220.12
mike sidoonich

232.239 --> 238.59900000000002
it says sub 2 early bird

235.439 --> 238.599
it does

241.36 --> 244.48000000000002
what

242.239 --> 247.439
what what says that

244.48 --> 247.439
besides myself

249.599 --> 254.23899999999998
anyway

251.2 --> 256.079
it is monday the 22nd

254.239 --> 259.759
second

256.079 --> 262.0
of november 2021

259.759 --> 264.40000000000003
uh

262.0 --> 264.4
let's see

266.24 --> 270.479
oh

267.28 --> 272.32
yeah it is kind of cold eight degrees

270.479 --> 274.8
well with the sun out i'm not really

272.32 --> 276.96
feeling it but yesterday as soon as the

274.8 --> 279.12
sun like got

276.96 --> 281.12
out of sight

279.12 --> 282.8
it did get cold

281.12 --> 284.32
it really did

282.8 --> 286.72
so it's probably going to be the same

284.32 --> 286.71999999999997
today

288.4 --> 292.63899999999995
so i'm going to enjoy that sun while

290.4 --> 294.32
it's out there

292.639 --> 295.36
literally

294.32 --> 297.44
because

295.36 --> 299.12
technically only exists

297.44 --> 302.24
as long as you see it

299.12 --> 302.24
because it's holographic

302.96 --> 306.08
oh the plane banner

306.88 --> 312.4
sub to war

308.96 --> 312.4
okay i get the joke now

313.6 --> 315.84000000000003
no

316.08 --> 319.35999999999996
i mean that could have fit on the banner

318.16 --> 323.16
but

319.36 --> 323.16
no that's just weird

329.039 --> 333.15999999999997
that would be hilarious though

339.919 --> 342.919
right

355.52 --> 360.479
so yesterday was overall

357.759 --> 363.68
i think a pretty quiet day

360.479 --> 364.84
like outside of the premiere from friday

363.68 --> 368.0
the fed

364.84 --> 371.039
premiere which was like very intense it

368.0 --> 371.039
was and but

371.52 --> 376.639
it was good to see it back because when

373.84 --> 379.039
it was going it was like kind of

376.639 --> 381.12
agitating too and like all of them we

379.039 --> 384.24
were all like riled up

381.12 --> 384.24
and brian was just

384.4 --> 388.71999999999997
you know

385.28 --> 390.23999999999995
one of his leprechaun moods

388.72 --> 392.319
that's a joke

390.24 --> 396.16
i still think he's awesome it's just

392.319 --> 398.96000000000004
like i have my moods he has his moods

396.16 --> 402.319
he had that idea stuck in his head

398.96 --> 405.19899999999996
and we're all like really eager to

402.319 --> 405.199
to clear it up

406.0 --> 410.8
but yeah watching it it actually was

408.56 --> 413.68
very informative and detailed like it

410.8 --> 416.479
was just like really focused physics

413.68 --> 418.479
basically around a single subject

416.479 --> 420.96
and that's interesting

418.479 --> 424.4
jared had a good fit

420.96 --> 424.4
did you see it yeah

427.039 --> 432.759
i think i did

428.96 --> 432.75899999999996
another clip right

436.319 --> 443.599
stephen hawkins like the uh yeah

440.88 --> 443.599
a bit about

443.919 --> 449.19899999999996
the pbs

445.919 --> 450.88
item with the helicopter

449.199 --> 454.24
yeah it really stood out to me like i

450.88 --> 457.039
hadn't even picked up on that that

454.24 --> 459.44
like it's all just a

457.039 --> 460.8
assembled presentation it wasn't

459.44 --> 463.199
actually

460.8 --> 466.0
like two cameras actually

463.199 --> 467.44
filming the same event because the then

466.0 --> 469.52
the

467.44 --> 472.4
helicopter would have been

469.52 --> 474.96
facing the other direction

472.4 --> 476.63899999999995
in on the other camera

474.96 --> 479.84
so yeah that

476.639 --> 479.84000000000003
hadn't even picked up on that

479.919 --> 484.4
but it's true the whole thing was just

482.16 --> 486.319
ridiculous and edited and all that so

484.4 --> 490.67999999999995
much wrong with it and they must have

486.319 --> 490.68
done it on purpose they must have

492.0 --> 495.599
it's unavoidable

495.919 --> 500.87899999999996
but it was interesting it was a good

497.52 --> 500.87899999999996
video very detailed

508.879 --> 514.64
right something that also really

512.8 --> 516.8
picked yeah that was

514.64 --> 518.7189999999999
very interesting but i forgot yeah i

516.8 --> 520.88
wasn't there live

518.719 --> 523.599
i still watched it back

520.88 --> 525.519
it was made by jim bob

523.599 --> 528.08
like he was having

525.519 --> 530.88
like a really elaborate

528.08 --> 533.279
philosophical discussion about

530.88 --> 535.12
spiritual veganism like really elaborate

533.279 --> 537.2
and i think that even

535.12 --> 539.12
nathan thompson he was chatting back and

537.2 --> 542.88
forth with him i'm not sure if he was in

539.12 --> 545.04
chat because the chat was unavailable

542.88 --> 548.92
the youtube chat it was gone

545.04 --> 548.92
so i couldn't see it

548.959 --> 551.5189999999999
but yeah

551.92 --> 556.56
very detailed

554.48 --> 558.08
interesting

556.56 --> 559.8389999999999
philosophically

558.08 --> 562.24
like the guy knows what he's talking

559.839 --> 564.72
about

562.24 --> 566.9590000000001
that's why i like him

564.72 --> 566.9590000000001
huh

567.44 --> 573.2
the ducks flying across just kills what

570.88 --> 577.04
oh right right yeah yeah

573.2 --> 579.279
yeah that yeah it's so full of

577.04 --> 581.5999999999999
edits and

579.279 --> 582.959
it's but they had to

581.6 --> 585.279
know

582.959 --> 587.68
because

585.279 --> 590.48
to try to achieve the fakery they

587.68 --> 593.8389999999999
wouldn't have had to go there

590.48 --> 597.12
because it was all recorded so it makes

593.839 --> 597.12
no sense other than

597.44 --> 602.48
it was there to

599.839 --> 605.0400000000001
reassure ball believers that wouldn't

602.48 --> 606.48
dig into the details

605.04 --> 609.76
but there

606.48 --> 612.24
also to show the details to actual flat

609.76 --> 612.24
earthers

614.88 --> 621.04
and why do they do that

616.959 --> 621.04
yeah that's a big mystery really

622.24 --> 624.48
but

622.959 --> 626.4799999999999
nasa seems to

624.48 --> 627.9200000000001
kind of operate like that

626.48 --> 628.88
and then

627.92 --> 632.0
like

628.88 --> 633.92
or is it not it's not directly nasa but

632.0 --> 636.48
like the group that is doing that that

633.92 --> 638.56
is faking space

636.48 --> 640.88
it seems like it's just

638.56 --> 643.5189999999999
mandatory

640.88 --> 646.399
for the real fakers

643.519 --> 649.2
the field fakers not just theories field

646.399 --> 649.2
fakers to

650.64 --> 657.1999999999999
show that it's actually fake

654.399 --> 659.92
that it's edited that it's assembled

657.2 --> 662.1600000000001
that it's basically made into a stage

659.92 --> 665.4399999999999
and it's not raw data

662.16 --> 665.4399999999999
like they have to do that

668.959 --> 673.1999999999999
it's a game for that well they probably

671.2 --> 676.0
do it like a game but it's also like

673.2 --> 678.72
they have to do that you don't see it

676.0 --> 678.72
without that

682.56 --> 687.04
hey lsg

684.399 --> 687.04
good to see you

687.519 --> 693.279
yeah i saw your your little private

690.16 --> 694.16
video you sent me uh about roofing you

693.279 --> 698.68
were

694.16 --> 698.68
working on the roof looked pretty good

710.88 --> 717.2
yeah yeah but look gerunds has like are

714.24 --> 719.92
these by the way

717.2 --> 722.1600000000001
these are like old videos right like

719.92 --> 724.079
snippets that he's taking out of

722.16 --> 727.12
his shows

724.079 --> 727.12
from over the years

727.2 --> 732.32
or is this like all very recent and he's

729.76 --> 735.04
just going through it again i'm not sure

732.32 --> 736.1600000000001
because i yeah to admit i haven't really

735.04 --> 738.639
watched like

736.16 --> 741.36
all of jaren's

738.639 --> 741.36
from the beginning

743.36 --> 749.519
so but i do remember this

746.639 --> 753.279
subject being treated by him like

749.519 --> 756.279
at least a year ago or more

753.279 --> 756.279
anyway

760.72 --> 765.44
right so flat side is having kind of a

762.8 --> 767.76
back and forth thing going now also with

765.44 --> 770.48
ranty

767.76 --> 773.04
made a pretty hilarious video yesterday

770.48 --> 775.6
very trollish though but

773.04 --> 777.12
yeah ranty totally deserves that because

775.6 --> 779.6
he's

777.12 --> 779.6
ranty

779.92 --> 784.04
he knows what he is now

795.12 --> 798.5600000000001
they are a few years just reposting

797.2 --> 801.36
clips right

798.56 --> 804.92
but good clips

801.36 --> 804.92
really good clips

814.639 --> 819.92
right in a way it kind of shows like the

817.279 --> 821.68
real value of his work

819.92 --> 825.04
that even though it's years ago it's

821.68 --> 827.76
still very on point

825.04 --> 829.36
so yeah i like his clips i like doing i

827.76 --> 831.4399999999999
don't really like watching like a

829.36 --> 833.519
two-hour show non-stop

831.44 --> 836.0790000000001
but i like the clips

833.519 --> 839.36
they're good clips

836.079 --> 843.4799999999999
good reference material

839.36 --> 843.48
so yeah keep it going jiren

843.839 --> 847.0400000000001
hello jeff gassett

852.399 --> 857.76
any updates on that

854.639 --> 860.0
weird video retraction situation that i

857.76 --> 860.0
just

860.16 --> 864.88
discussed yesterday

862.32 --> 868.399
everybody a couple of guys here just

864.88 --> 872.639
kept on being rowdy about that

868.399 --> 872.639
any updates or nothing new

874.24 --> 878.639
i didn't watch like bulb uh glow busters

876.88 --> 881.519
i i don't really watch glow busters

878.639 --> 885.72
anymore for a while but

881.519 --> 885.72
some of you probably still do

897.12 --> 903.279
yes gadget inspector i know

899.519 --> 903.279
but he's a clown

905.6 --> 909.0400000000001
he he really is

909.36 --> 914.32
like he even has the sadness of the

912.079 --> 916.16
clown now the only thing that's missing

914.32 --> 918.88
is just that he has like a standard

916.16 --> 918.88
clown makeup

920.399 --> 923.68
but i really think he found his calling

922.399 --> 925.839
in there

923.68 --> 928.2399999999999
doing what he does like he had to do it

925.839 --> 930.5600000000001
he even said it when he was still like a

928.24 --> 931.839
flat earther he just said like i i have

930.56 --> 933.5999999999999
to do this

931.839 --> 934.72
like dude you're [ __ ] out of your

933.6 --> 936.0790000000001
mind

934.72 --> 938.88
don't go there

936.079 --> 938.88
you'll be sorry

939.12 --> 941.839
but he did it anyway

942.0 --> 948.399
and has been doing it

945.33 --> 948.399
[Applause]

957.04 --> 960.04
right

972.88 --> 977.68
huh right so i've been

975.279 --> 977.68
playing

978.079 --> 981.199
the video game follow up

980.16 --> 983.519
from

981.199 --> 984.639
pathfinder king maker the wrath of the

983.519 --> 986.0
righteous

984.639 --> 987.519
and

986.0 --> 988.959
it's decent

987.519 --> 990.32
i don't think it's as good as the

988.959 --> 993.5999999999999
previous one

990.32 --> 996.639
it's also because i'm just i'm it's

993.6 --> 999.0400000000001
really starting to show

996.639 --> 1003.24
that there's like

999.04 --> 1003.24
certain types of influences

1006.0 --> 1008.639
in this

1007.519 --> 1011.36
like

1008.639 --> 1014.32
in the character setup mainly like the

1011.36 --> 1018.88
characters you're dealing with

1014.32 --> 1018.88
starting to notice a distinct pattern

1019.36 --> 1022.36
seriously

1024.559 --> 1028.48
but yeah despite that it's still pretty

1026.319 --> 1030.6399999999999
good game but it just feels so like i'm

1028.48 --> 1033.3600000000001
surrounded by

1030.64 --> 1036.0
lefties everywhere

1033.36 --> 1038.799
in the game

1036.0 --> 1041.679
it's like all women warriors and

1038.799 --> 1043.9189999999999
wizards and like

1041.679 --> 1045.919
there's like one guy

1043.919 --> 1048.64
and he's evil

1045.919 --> 1050.64
like oh yeah

1048.64 --> 1052.48
okay

1050.64 --> 1054.3200000000002
uh

1052.48 --> 1056.24
so that's a bit annoying but other than

1054.32 --> 1057.84
that it's

1056.24 --> 1059.76
it's okay

1057.84 --> 1061.84
i don't yeah i'm still in the early

1059.76 --> 1064.84
stages of the game

1061.84 --> 1068.24
but yeah that pattern has become quite

1064.84 --> 1068.24
noticeable here

1068.88 --> 1072.4
but

1069.84 --> 1075.1999999999998
when it comes to like a cultural

1072.4 --> 1078.24
background detail

1075.2 --> 1078.24
it's pretty decent

1079.12 --> 1083.1999999999998
like when you really start reading the

1080.88 --> 1085.2
dialogue and like the the verbal

1083.2 --> 1088.24
dialogue is pretty good

1085.2 --> 1090.16
there's not as much in there as

1088.24 --> 1092.72
well there is

1090.16 --> 1094.559
yeah it's just weird sometimes it's

1092.72 --> 1096.72
actually you hear a

1094.559 --> 1098.6399999999999
sound bite of somebody speaking the text

1096.72 --> 1100.32
and while you're reading it other times

1098.64 --> 1102.3200000000002
you don't

1100.32 --> 1104.559
and that's like weird

1102.32 --> 1106.8799999999999
sometimes like if you're gonna put in a

1104.559 --> 1109.44
lot of actual

1106.88 --> 1112.3200000000002
auditory dialogue

1109.44 --> 1114.88
then it gets weird when there isn't any

1112.32 --> 1118.08
but anyway so details

1114.88 --> 1118.0800000000002
hey neil cosatino

1119.44 --> 1124.3200000000002
but yeah the uh let's just call it sjw

1122.64 --> 1127.2800000000002
type programming

1124.32 --> 1129.12
it's not super overt but like the the

1127.28 --> 1130.48
characters you're presented with it's

1129.12 --> 1132.08
like

1130.48 --> 1135.1200000000001
okay

1132.08 --> 1137.1999999999998
not that i'm even like

1135.12 --> 1139.84
despise the characters they present you

1137.2 --> 1142.24
with it's just

1139.84 --> 1142.24
okay

1142.64 --> 1146.7990000000002
like oh yeah by the way it's not true

1144.48 --> 1150.48
it's like two guys one guy is like a

1146.799 --> 1152.799
serious mutant and like a it's kind of a

1150.48 --> 1154.72
gesture type

1152.799 --> 1156.8799999999999
and the other guy is like an evil

1154.72 --> 1159.039
nobility guy like

1156.88 --> 1159.0390000000002
but

1161.6 --> 1166.9599999999998
how do you say that it's difficult like

1163.679 --> 1168.799
he's evil but he's not like

1166.96 --> 1171.679
like an infiltrator

1168.799 --> 1174.0
as far as i can tell so far anyway but

1171.679 --> 1176.48
it's just like come on the rest is all

1174.0 --> 1176.48
girls

1177.44 --> 1179.8400000000001
this is

1183.039 --> 1186.96
anyway

1184.16 --> 1186.96
not giving in

1188.799 --> 1193.32
just walked off a job whoa

1194.559 --> 1198.48
all right neil

1197.039 --> 1201.36
that's

1198.48 --> 1201.3600000000001
that's upsetting

1204.88 --> 1210.64
but you're you're basically like your

1206.88 --> 1210.64
own company right so you basically

1211.76 --> 1215.36
declined

1213.2 --> 1215.3600000000001
a

1216.4 --> 1220.5590000000002
an order or something

1218.559 --> 1225.2
because they demand you got tests it's

1220.559 --> 1225.2
not like your job you just lost right

1233.36 --> 1237.84
right exactly exactly okay okay

1241.919 --> 1248.679
no but that doesn't work jason brown

1244.799 --> 1248.679
it doesn't work that way

1248.96 --> 1253.039
right it's not his uh

1251.52 --> 1254.48
his employee

1253.039 --> 1257.679
that's

1254.48 --> 1260.64
that's like demanding it it's like

1257.679 --> 1264.0
he's sent out

1260.64 --> 1266.159
and where he is gonna do the task they

1264.0 --> 1267.84
want him to do the test right

1266.159 --> 1270.96
they can't really

1267.84 --> 1272.8799999999999
yeah that doesn't make any sense

1270.96 --> 1275.28
to get fired from that it's not your

1272.88 --> 1277.1200000000001
company really it's a

1275.28 --> 1279.44
somebody that's basically taking an

1277.12 --> 1279.4399999999998
order

1279.84 --> 1284.799
the best you could do is just refuse

1282.32 --> 1284.799
that's it

1288.799 --> 1291.84
all right

1292.88 --> 1298.48
see i i do get this stuff even though i

1295.679 --> 1300.72
barely had a job in my life i do get how

1298.48 --> 1304.919
this kind of works

1300.72 --> 1304.919
contracting right

1320.88 --> 1326.72
well sorry for neil

1324.24 --> 1330.2
no the the place that placed the order

1326.72 --> 1330.2
should be sorry

1337.52 --> 1341.12
i mean they're gonna not get the good

1339.52 --> 1344.8799999999999
workers

1341.12 --> 1348.32
only did the the v numpties

1344.88 --> 1348.3200000000002
they should be the ones sorry

1350.64 --> 1356.1200000000001
then they test you for drugs and alcohol

1353.12 --> 1356.12
okay

1364.24 --> 1368.24
hey

1365.6 --> 1370.8799999999999
hello bex thank you for the

1368.24 --> 1370.88
22

1372.88 --> 1379.2
knock it's like

1375.919 --> 1380.4
norwegian cronin or something

1379.2 --> 1382.48
is it

1380.4 --> 1384.64
thank you for that

1382.48 --> 1387.96
i don't know how much it is but yeah

1384.64 --> 1387.96
that's cool

1397.039 --> 1402.8799999999999
what's wrong with the test oh god

1399.52 --> 1404.72
we we got a numpty in the chat

1402.88 --> 1407.8400000000001
no no there is something wrong with the

1404.72 --> 1409.84
test logical conclusion

1407.84 --> 1410.9599999999998
those tests

1409.84 --> 1413.76
are

1410.96 --> 1415.76
like unpredicted like what oh if you

1413.76 --> 1417.84
don't have it well then you have nothing

1415.76 --> 1420.08
to yeah but they're those tests there

1417.84 --> 1422.24
are no tests for this stuff that are

1420.08 --> 1424.32
reliable

1422.24 --> 1426.4
it it can't work

1424.32 --> 1430.1589999999999
there's no there's not even like an

1426.4 --> 1433.2
original signature to truly look for

1430.159 --> 1434.64
with the test it's completely pointless

1433.2 --> 1435.919
and

1434.64 --> 1437.679
there's

1435.919 --> 1440.3200000000002
like a lot of

1437.679 --> 1441.52
insight that i've gathered over over the

1440.32 --> 1443.76
the year

1441.52 --> 1446.72
that like some of these tests like the

1443.76 --> 1448.0
q-tips and all they have toxic chemicals

1446.72 --> 1450.159
on them

1448.0 --> 1452.559
you don't want to have

1450.159 --> 1454.64
your body to absorb that the more you do

1452.559 --> 1455.9189999999999
that the worse it like it's going to be

1454.64 --> 1458.0
for your body

1455.919 --> 1460.4
so yeah there is something wrong with

1458.0 --> 1464.72
test first they don't work and even like

1460.4 --> 1464.72
the designer of the tests admitted that

1465.279 --> 1467.6
and

1468.4 --> 1472.24
you get

1470.159 --> 1473.5200000000002
yeah north norwegian crown ah i called

1472.24 --> 1476.48
it

1473.52 --> 1478.799
approximately two dollars okay

1476.48 --> 1478.799
wow

1479.039 --> 1484.32
that's not a lot

1481.12 --> 1484.32
but yeah thanks

1485.36 --> 1489.6789999999999
right fake and tainted that's one way of

1487.279 --> 1489.679
saying it

1499.039 --> 1503.76
right and then there's that

1500.96 --> 1506.24
there are suspicions that did yeah that

1503.76 --> 1509.36
they're actually collecting dna

1506.24 --> 1509.36
when they're doing tests

1511.279 --> 1515.84
so yeah there's a lot of good reasons

1513.279 --> 1515.84
not to do that

1516.88 --> 1521.679
it's not even that just

1519.039 --> 1525.12
oh well neil hey dude

1521.679 --> 1528.1200000000001
it's a good thing not to give in to

1525.12 --> 1528.12
right

1535.919 --> 1538.72
i'm with you man

1541.44 --> 1546.24
but it would be good

1543.679 --> 1548.48
if you got another like another

1546.24 --> 1548.48
uh

1548.64 --> 1552.0800000000002
not another job

1550.48 --> 1555.76
well i guess you could call it a job

1552.08 --> 1556.799
like another task instead

1555.76 --> 1559.52
i mean

1556.799 --> 1564.08
surely there are

1559.52 --> 1566.24
tasks out there in your line of work

1564.08 --> 1570.039
where they don't demand you get tests

1566.24 --> 1570.039
like they don't care

1572.08 --> 1575.12
hey melby styles

1576.48 --> 1581.1200000000001
why are you numpty for asking a

1578.159 --> 1581.1200000000001
reasonable question

1582.0 --> 1585.12
because

1582.96 --> 1587.1200000000001
you're by even saying that's a

1585.12 --> 1591.36
reasonable question at this point that

1587.12 --> 1591.36
proves you're completely misinformed

1595.12 --> 1598.52
that's why

1616.32 --> 1621.36
all right gadget inspector

1619.44 --> 1623.8400000000001
sure if you do it once for something

1621.36 --> 1623.84
like that

1624.0 --> 1627.679
okay so i've been misinformed how does

1625.679 --> 1630.24
it make you a numpty

1627.679 --> 1632.96
because you're still misinformed all

1630.24 --> 1636.159
this [ __ ] all this info

1632.96 --> 1640.32
is literally like spraying all over

1636.159 --> 1642.96
media out there like everybody

1640.32 --> 1644.559
is echoing the info about it

1642.96 --> 1646.96
yet

1644.559 --> 1648.559
you didn't see any reason why not to

1646.96 --> 1652.08
take the test well that makes you a

1648.559 --> 1653.039
numpty that makes you willingly ignorant

1652.08 --> 1655.12
or

1653.039 --> 1657.039
fearful and avoidant

1655.12 --> 1660.799
of the information that you need to know

1657.039 --> 1664.6
in order to draw a different conclusion

1660.799 --> 1664.6
that makes you a numpty

1680.96 --> 1685.2
hello marvel were you talking to

1685.52 --> 1690.08
kooky i don't know what who that is

1691.36 --> 1696.039
am i using artificial intelligence

1696.48 --> 1699.48
how

1715.6 --> 1721.1999999999998
if someone lies to you and you believe

1717.84 --> 1722.24
them that makes you a numpty

1721.2 --> 1726.799
well

1722.24 --> 1726.799
if it's like a really complicated lie

1726.88 --> 1731.3600000000001
very well concealed no

1729.12 --> 1731.36
right

1732.48 --> 1737.44
if it's a very elaborate setup yeah

1734.72 --> 1740.64
that's that can be very easy to bite

1737.44 --> 1743.1200000000001
into and you didn't get any hints that

1740.64 --> 1745.5200000000002
you were being fooled that's difficult

1743.12 --> 1747.76
this however

1745.52 --> 1750.399
is a whole different scale

1747.76 --> 1752.96
because the information about it

1750.399 --> 1755.6
i've even literally shared it right

1752.96 --> 1757.3600000000001
before this you seem to just mind blank

1755.6 --> 1761.1999999999998
everything i said or maybe you're just

1757.36 --> 1761.1999999999998
not really paying attention at all

1761.679 --> 1765.2
right it's kind the hints are kind of

1764.0 --> 1768.559
overt

1765.2 --> 1768.559
if you don't pick up on that

1768.96 --> 1772.96
yeah

1770.48 --> 1774.64
that makes you a numpty

1772.96 --> 1778.52
that makes you kind of willingly

1774.64 --> 1778.5200000000002
ignorant or avoidant

1784.96 --> 1787.96
so

1803.36 --> 1807.6789999999999
am i in the area where riots are

1805.6 --> 1809.36
happening melvi styles no

1807.679 --> 1811.6000000000001
not that i've picked up on but i did

1809.36 --> 1813.6789999999999
notice by the way good yeah

1811.6 --> 1816.48
well not good thing but

1813.679 --> 1819.679
now that you're mentioning it

1816.48 --> 1820.96
apparently there were another

1819.679 --> 1824.72
there was another ride in the

1820.96 --> 1827.039
netherlands this time in den hague

1824.72 --> 1829.679
i haven't checked out the details but

1827.039 --> 1829.679
apparently

1831.679 --> 1836.1200000000001
it wasn't just the one in rotterdam

1846.0 --> 1849.88
why did i read that

1850.0 --> 1852.88
think

1851.2 --> 1855.52
it might have happened like on saturday

1852.88 --> 1855.5200000000002
or sunday

1856.48 --> 1860.24
like the next day i can't find it back

1858.88 --> 1863.24
now

1860.24 --> 1863.24
anyway

1864.32 --> 1870.08
new york city yeah neil cause i got that

1867.36 --> 1871.9189999999999
i i get it

1870.08 --> 1875.76
it would be kind of weird neil if you

1871.919 --> 1879.8400000000001
were talking about literal giants

1875.76 --> 1881.76
i mean you're not that small

1879.84 --> 1884.48
i don't think you're scared a giant of

1881.76 --> 1886.24
like big people either so yeah i i

1884.48 --> 1890.84
understood you were talking about the

1886.24 --> 1890.84
football team giants yeah

1898.559 --> 1902.72
oh cookie holds the world record oh so

1900.96 --> 1905.76
it's an ai well

1902.72 --> 1907.84
dude i'm a person i'm a human being damn

1905.76 --> 1907.84
it

1908.64 --> 1914.0
it's live you're seeing me on camera you

1910.799 --> 1918.12
think that any of this is fake

1914.0 --> 1918.12
what the [ __ ] is going on

1932.0 --> 1935.0
hmm

1938.399 --> 1943.12
feeling there's going to be worldwide

1940.799 --> 1946.12
riot

1943.12 --> 1946.12
maybe

1948.08 --> 1951.6789999999999
maybe my message got through

1955.6 --> 1960.559
weirdly

1957.519 --> 1962.96
like yeah this oh peaceful it's not

1960.559 --> 1965.84
working i didn't really ask for riots

1962.96 --> 1967.44
though it's like i don't

1965.84 --> 1970.72
and it's like maybe it's just

1967.44 --> 1970.72
preliminary right

1971.12 --> 1975.6789999999999
i was much more about just

1974.399 --> 1978.32
yeah

1975.679 --> 1981.2
more militant idea about it

1978.32 --> 1982.48
like no not just

1981.2 --> 1984.88
like you can't

1982.48 --> 1987.039
thread on me type of [ __ ] and then

1984.88 --> 1988.72
getting in brawls

1987.039 --> 1992.08
because then you're just gonna go after

1988.72 --> 1994.88
police and cause damage again and

1992.08 --> 1996.24
like that doesn't accomplish

1994.88 --> 1999.279
a switch

1996.24 --> 1999.279
of the situation

2001.6 --> 2008.32
but maybe it's just a buildup

2005.76 --> 2010.72
where is the world headed coming five

2008.32 --> 2010.72
years

2014.32 --> 2019.84
i think it's gonna just polarize more

2016.399 --> 2024.32
and harden up

2019.84 --> 2024.32
and i think that like the way that the

2024.399 --> 2032.4799999999998
the demonic liars are going at it

2027.519 --> 2036.159
that they're just gonna get so off tone

2032.48 --> 2038.48
that it might actually cause like

2036.159 --> 2040.64
a weird kind of split in consciousness

2038.48 --> 2043.279
because there's just no viable way you

2040.64 --> 2045.519
can deal with it

2043.279 --> 2050.0
but it's still like having this surreal

2045.519 --> 2053.2
influence to those who do listen to it

2050.0 --> 2053.2
it's very unhealthy

2053.359 --> 2057.359
that it's out there

2055.119 --> 2059.44
that that's happening this level of mind

2057.359 --> 2062.159
control and aggressive

2059.44 --> 2062.159
mind control

2063.919 --> 2067.1189999999997
it's gonna wear on people

2068.0 --> 2074.2
like even the strong ones even the ones

2070.32 --> 2074.2000000000003
that are actually like

2074.96 --> 2079.2
trying to rally people and all that

2080.96 --> 2085.679
and that's why i'm saying yeah that's

2082.48 --> 2087.599
what i've said like no you

2085.679 --> 2090.56
like

2087.599 --> 2093.9190000000003
these people don't have like the balance

2090.56 --> 2093.919
issues that we do

2094.96 --> 2100.839
so they're just gonna make it worse and

2096.96 --> 2103.44
worse and things that you

2100.839 --> 2105.68
thought right

2103.44 --> 2107.44
might just suddenly change because

2105.68 --> 2110.7999999999997
certain things are wearing on you that

2107.44 --> 2114.2400000000002
you didn't even realize could be worn on

2110.8 --> 2116.7200000000003
that would deteriorate faculties for

2114.24 --> 2118.8799999999997
example

2116.72 --> 2121.2
from long stressful manipulative

2118.88 --> 2122.56
exposure it kind of changes your

2121.2 --> 2125.4399999999996
dynamics

2122.56 --> 2128.16
over time it's bad

2125.44 --> 2131.119
it's mental torture and that wears on

2128.16 --> 2132.96
you

2131.119 --> 2134.96
you can't just find the strength

2132.96 --> 2137.44
position in the conscious position and

2134.96 --> 2139.68
then it doesn't influence you anymore no

2137.44 --> 2140.4
it does it still does just because you

2139.68 --> 2142.3999999999996
know

2140.4 --> 2145.839
it's manipulative doesn't mean it's not

2142.4 --> 2145.839
gonna wear on you

2146.56 --> 2148.7999999999997
right

2150.48 --> 2155.44
it's like true indoctrination true

2152.72 --> 2157.68
indoctrination you start out

2155.44 --> 2159.599
thinking or like realizing having

2157.68 --> 2161.359
information knowing it's fake but then

2159.599 --> 2164.32
as you listen

2161.359 --> 2167.119
it still compels you to then consider

2164.32 --> 2168.88
that you might have been wrong

2167.119 --> 2171.44
even though

2168.88 --> 2173.119
you actually had real proof you kind of

2171.44 --> 2175.839
forget and that's like real

2173.119 --> 2177.6800000000003
indoctrination it's like hypnotism even

2175.839 --> 2179.92
if you did even if you thought at first

2177.68 --> 2182.16
like i can't trust this

2179.92 --> 2183.839
you might still be pulled in

2182.16 --> 2186.24
and the more of that sort of thing

2183.839 --> 2188.16
happens out there the weaker everybody

2186.24 --> 2190.3999999999996
gets you don't get stronger from it you

2188.16 --> 2192.3999999999996
actually get weaker from it

2190.4 --> 2195.52
it's going to be more difficult not to

2192.4 --> 2199.0
get sucked in because it it's weighing

2195.52 --> 2199.0
on you everywhere

2205.839 --> 2210.96
right and that's why i'm saying like it

2208.0 --> 2210.96
just needs to end

2211.76 --> 2216.079
the way it's

2213.04 --> 2218.24
being set up needs to be discontinued

2216.079 --> 2220.7200000000003
and it's not going to discontinue by

2218.24 --> 2220.72
itself

2222.4 --> 2227.2000000000003
and forming like another front

2225.04 --> 2229.2799999999997
as an alternative

2227.2 --> 2231.7599999999998
is not going to work on the long run

2229.28 --> 2233.0400000000004
they have like a permanent unfair

2231.76 --> 2234.48
advantage

2233.04 --> 2237.04
and they're not going to give up that

2234.48 --> 2237.04
advantage

2238.0 --> 2242.0
and

2239.119 --> 2244.2400000000002
the ones that do this are like literally

2242.0 --> 2247.92
prepared to suffer for it which is

2244.24 --> 2247.9199999999996
completely insane but they are

2248.32 --> 2255.32
just like we are except

2251.2 --> 2255.3199999999997
they have an unfair advantage

2259.2 --> 2265.2799999999997
they have no objections to deepen the

2262.8 --> 2269.32
lies and the mind control

2265.28 --> 2269.32
they have no moral objections

2270.4 --> 2275.04
and that's an unfair advantage not an

2272.64 --> 2278.92
advantage that you should be jealous of

2275.04 --> 2278.92
but it is what it is

2288.079 --> 2292.04
what are you talking about

2320.079 --> 2325.44
right but yeah right it's happening

2323.119 --> 2327.2000000000003
we'll see where it goes

2325.44 --> 2329.92
another weird thing by the way that i

2327.2 --> 2332.96
picked up on

2329.92 --> 2335.04
but it i guess it's to be expected

2332.96 --> 2339.079
i hello that flat fellow thanks for the

2335.04 --> 2339.079
99 cent super chat

2341.52 --> 2349.68
like did anybody see like the the first

2345.76 --> 2349.6800000000003
interview from rittenhouse

2350.72 --> 2354.64
like

2351.839 --> 2356.4
he immediately cooked

2354.64 --> 2359.359
like on the first interview he was

2356.4 --> 2363.839
basically like oh i'm not a racist

2359.359 --> 2363.839
i'm not a racist i actually support blm

2367.2 --> 2372.16
so i guess he's maneuvering to become

2369.68 --> 2375.2
the next conservative

2372.16 --> 2375.2
special boy now

2375.28 --> 2380.1600000000003
oh yeah again it's to be expected

2381.44 --> 2385.04
but he could have just

2383.04 --> 2388.079
like

2385.04 --> 2390.96
went full force

2388.079 --> 2393.2000000000003
and just said like no

2390.96 --> 2396.8
they're

2393.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
like communist infiltrator organizations

2396.8 --> 2401.8390000000004
they are the racists they promote race

2399.119 --> 2405.1600000000003
they could have done all that but no

2401.839 --> 2405.16
no he didn't

2411.28 --> 2414.28
so

2428.88 --> 2431.92
how is he that dumb

2434.4 --> 2438.079
yeah

2435.92 --> 2441.359
but it just

2438.079 --> 2441.3590000000004
it's fighting the [ __ ]

2441.44 --> 2444.88
he is

2442.72 --> 2448.16
joining the swamp

2444.88 --> 2449.119
it's to be expected

2448.16 --> 2453.24
it's like

2449.119 --> 2453.2400000000002
what's this guy's name again

2456.88 --> 2459.76
oh yeah david hawk

2458.8 --> 2462.7200000000003
right

2459.76 --> 2464.96
he did the same thing sort of for the

2462.72 --> 2466.72
democrats he became like a democrat

2464.96 --> 2471.119
special boy

2466.72 --> 2471.1189999999997
well it seems like kyle rittenhouse is

2471.2 --> 2474.72
at least now

2472.56 --> 2478.24
seems like he's maneuvering towards

2474.72 --> 2480.7999999999997
becoming part of the conservatives

2478.24 --> 2483.4399999999996
a new special boy there yeah but they

2480.8 --> 2484.96
are all freaking [ __ ] and they're gay

2483.44 --> 2486.4
and they're

2484.96 --> 2488.64
like

2486.4 --> 2493.44
super cooked

2488.64 --> 2496.8799999999997
apologetic towards insane maniacal

2493.44 --> 2498.7200000000003
reversed world nazis which are the other

2496.88 --> 2501.04
side

2498.72 --> 2502.72
you can't [ __ ] to that anymore but they

2501.04 --> 2505.599
are doing it

2502.72 --> 2506.839
they're all doing it it's terrible

2505.599 --> 2508.56
and

2506.839 --> 2511.359
pointless

2508.56 --> 2514.56
it's almost like like a very serious

2511.359 --> 2516.88
controlled opposition like they're

2514.56 --> 2520.839
to be the alternative and to [ __ ] that

2516.88 --> 2523.04
hard is that's like maybe even more

2520.839 --> 2526.72
damaging than what the democrats are

2523.04 --> 2526.72
doing two conservatives

2527.839 --> 2533.2
almost makes me think it is just a giant

2530.56 --> 2537.839
monolithic conspiracy

2533.2 --> 2537.839
like really seriously evil conspiracy

2549.44 --> 2552.88
thems are the racists

2553.359 --> 2556.24
yeah yeah they're everything that they

2555.2 --> 2557.5989999999997
say

2556.24 --> 2559.4399999999996
the opponent is

2557.599 --> 2561.3590000000004
they're reversed rollers

2559.44 --> 2564.16
straight out

2561.359 --> 2566.319
but to then [ __ ] and then like to

2564.16 --> 2568.96
entertain any of that

2566.319 --> 2570.56
instead of just straight out saying

2568.96 --> 2573.2
no

2570.56 --> 2575.839
you're satanic you're doing exactly the

2573.2 --> 2576.72
opposite of everything you say everybody

2575.839 --> 2578.24
you

2576.72 --> 2579.2
every time you accuse somebody of

2578.24 --> 2581.52
something

2579.2 --> 2583.68
that's literally on the spot projection

2581.52 --> 2586.24
of what you're doing to try to distract

2583.68 --> 2589.5989999999997
away from what you're doing every single

2586.24 --> 2591.5989999999997
time you could have just said that

2589.599 --> 2594.6400000000003
but then you wouldn't probably get all

2591.599 --> 2597.04
that attention from the republican side

2594.64 --> 2599.52
all of a sudden

2597.04 --> 2601.839
because in order to do that you have to

2599.52 --> 2605.96
play the [ __ ] game

2601.839 --> 2605.96
and become a conservative

2610.079 --> 2613.599
you know what i'm talking about right

2619.599 --> 2622.96
i mean

2620.72 --> 2625.68
with the republicans and on the right

2622.96 --> 2630.0
wing the only thing you can be hardcore

2625.68 --> 2633.359
about are completely pointless things

2630.0 --> 2635.839
or like unresolvable issues

2633.359 --> 2637.04
that people will forever be divided

2635.839 --> 2640.88
about

2637.04 --> 2642.88
even in a more stable situation

2640.88 --> 2645.6800000000003
you can't actually

2642.88 --> 2648.2400000000002
make a difference change it for real you

2645.68 --> 2651.2799999999997
can't do that

2648.24 --> 2651.2799999999997
hey what's this

2653.76 --> 2656.7200000000003
yeah what's going on

2657.44 --> 2660.839
alex g

2669.04 --> 2672.4
are you pocket banning

2672.96 --> 2677.48
or is it just fat finger syndrome

2695.2 --> 2699.4399999999996
amazing no it just means that the trolls

2697.76 --> 2700.7200000000003
are

2699.44 --> 2703.2000000000003
like

2700.72 --> 2706.48
they're just sleeping

2703.2 --> 2708.56
usually when like nathan oakley

2706.48 --> 2710.8
appears like all the trolls just start

2708.56 --> 2713.599
to wake up and then they join my chat to

2710.8 --> 2713.599
start whining

2714.24 --> 2719.2
right before they can go to the

2716.88 --> 2722.7200000000003
the chat

2719.2 --> 2724.64
over at life and oakley's life so

2722.72 --> 2726.8799999999997
they're still asleep and i'm fine with

2724.64 --> 2726.8799999999997
that

2728.96 --> 2732.88
hey random explorer yeah i mentioned

2731.119 --> 2736.48
pocket banning now it's just that at

2732.88 --> 2736.48
least g just seemed to have

2736.96 --> 2743.599
banned an unbanned old haas rod born for

2739.68 --> 2745.359
no reason because he didn't say anything

2743.599 --> 2747.44
crazy or anything

2745.359 --> 2751.2799999999997
or out of line

2747.44 --> 2754.64
just monolithic indeed it would seem

2751.28 --> 2756.96
intricately thought out unfortunately

2754.64 --> 2759.359
bizarre indeed like

2756.96 --> 2761.04
oh my god how dare you say that

2759.359 --> 2762.64
no

2761.04 --> 2763.92
i'm pretty sure it was like a pocket

2762.64 --> 2766.96
banning or

2763.92 --> 2766.96
fat finger syndrome

2771.599 --> 2775.839
yeah pocket man all right it was a

2773.2 --> 2775.839
[ __ ] man

2779.76 --> 2783.76
that only happens if you have a freaking

2782.0 --> 2787.16
mobile phone

2783.76 --> 2787.1600000000003
by the way

2799.839 --> 2804.48
how do you see thumbs down all i see on

2802.16 --> 2806.7999999999997
youtube now is dislikes

2804.48 --> 2806.8
really

2808.48 --> 2812.079
well that might

2810.079 --> 2814.48
be your settings

2812.079 --> 2814.48
clutch

2814.64 --> 2819.52
because i still see i think you can like

2817.44 --> 2822.319
in the settings of youtube you can

2819.52 --> 2824.319
choose to turn off

2822.319 --> 2827.359
you can like go along with that program

2824.319 --> 2828.079
and not see the dislikes anymore

2827.359 --> 2830.88
and

2828.079 --> 2832.4
yeah if that option exists then you all

2830.88 --> 2834.56
know that

2832.4 --> 2836.96
youtube likes to sometimes like oh we're

2834.56 --> 2841.7999999999997
gonna just overhaul everything oh you

2836.96 --> 2841.8
suddenly switched that on oh

2844.88 --> 2849.28
right

2845.92 --> 2849.28
that heck that could have happened

2852.64 --> 2856.4
new update maybe no but they did

2854.559 --> 2858.1600000000003
announce that they were gonna do that

2856.4 --> 2860.7200000000003
that they were gonna hide the dislike

2858.16 --> 2864.3999999999996
button or uh that they wouldn't show the

2860.72 --> 2864.3999999999996
dislikes anymore only the likes

2865.359 --> 2870.88
mostly to hide the unpopularity of like

2869.119 --> 2873.04
the sea

2870.88 --> 2874.8
propaganda

2873.04 --> 2879.16
which were like getting massively

2874.8 --> 2879.1600000000003
downvoted like massively

2888.0 --> 2892.8
what's the latest hot topic in my

2889.92 --> 2894.7200000000003
opinion l junkie uh

2892.8 --> 2896.96
well currently there's

2894.72 --> 2898.839
it's rowdy time so there's people going

2896.96 --> 2903.28
at it with anti-flat

2898.839 --> 2906.88
earthers uh mechanically

2903.28 --> 2909.0400000000004
was been a lot of attention to the

2906.88 --> 2913.52
the to the sexton

2909.04 --> 2913.52
so the sexton is kind of the item of

2913.76 --> 2917.119
of the past few months

2919.599 --> 2925.3590000000004
or it's it's like even been declared the

2921.839 --> 2925.359
year of the saxon wasn't it

2925.839 --> 2931.44
next year would be the year of the sun

2929.2 --> 2932.48
but yeah there's a lot of sextant talks

2931.44 --> 2935.52
and

2932.48 --> 2939.359
a lot of anti-flat earthers trying to

2935.52 --> 2939.359
argue how it would work on the globe

2940.24 --> 2944.7999999999997
like i even had somebody in my chat

2942.48 --> 2947.76
saying like whoa mr sensible you don't

2944.8 --> 2949.92
need the horizon to use a sextant

2947.76 --> 2952.0
just use a water level i addressed that

2949.92 --> 2954.0
yesterday on my show elaborately oh

2952.0 --> 2957.0
that's ridiculous it could never work at

2954.0 --> 2957.0
sea

2970.96 --> 2974.4
what

2972.559 --> 2978.119
you're out of your league

2974.4 --> 2978.119
what are you talking about

2990.88 --> 2995.119
oh yeah lop

2993.04 --> 2997.68
i i take it that's actually what that

2995.119 --> 2998.6400000000003
character is saying there llp

2997.68 --> 3001.359
yeah

2998.64 --> 3004.0
well i have that all the time but that's

3001.359 --> 3006.96
basically people yeah they they spend

3004.0 --> 3010.88
their time making stock accounts

3006.96 --> 3014.079
to give somebody a pile of down votes

3010.88 --> 3016.1600000000003
but that gets removed by youtube

3014.079 --> 3018.2400000000002
eventually because it's not a real

3016.16 --> 3021.04
account with no activity so they take it

3018.24 --> 3023.7599999999998
away again that's normal and with me it

3021.04 --> 3026.7599999999998
even gets taken away within a day every

3023.76 --> 3026.76
time

3029.76 --> 3035.5200000000004
but that's normal that's troll that's

3031.68 --> 3035.52
soccer counts doing the down votes

3038.96 --> 3045.44
that's mostly anti-flat earthers that

3041.52 --> 3046.64
are like really into like the politics

3045.44 --> 3049.119
almost

3046.64 --> 3051.04
of making sure that flat earthers seem

3049.119 --> 3053.6800000000003
very unpopular like they're like

3051.04 --> 3055.2
dedicated to that [ __ ]

3053.68 --> 3057.04
but they come and go

3055.2 --> 3058.7999999999997
sometimes they're like really on to you

3057.04 --> 3061.52
and for months and then they kind of

3058.8 --> 3063.2000000000003
like tire out and then or go on vacation

3061.52 --> 3064.8
or move on to somebody else and then

3063.2 --> 3067.1189999999997
they stop

3064.8 --> 3069.92
so it's been kind of quiet

3067.119 --> 3072.48
the last two weeks i think with the down

3069.92 --> 3075.7200000000003
votes when before that it was constantly

3072.48 --> 3075.72
like towering

3086.319 --> 3091.359
yeah wearing her don't don't talk to

3089.2 --> 3094.359
people in my chat like that

3091.359 --> 3094.359
please

3107.44 --> 3111.16
now i'll do it

3114.48 --> 3118.64
don't neck people in my chat thanks

3123.52 --> 3127.839
it depends on when amazon releases new

3126.0 --> 3129.44
gifts what

3127.839 --> 3135.319
i don't know what that

3129.44 --> 3135.319
how that works tara 306 welcome to chat

3146.559 --> 3150.079
after my show today i'm finally going to

3148.24 --> 3153.839
get

3150.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
my vitamin c supplements back

3155.52 --> 3158.8
or while getting a new batch

3158.88 --> 3162.0
it's really about time

3163.119 --> 3166.839
i don't miss it

3167.359 --> 3170.24
get contained

3177.2 --> 3181.9199999999996
what teratrio say are you saying that

3179.28 --> 3184.1600000000003
amazon literally sponsors people like

3181.92 --> 3184.16
that

3185.04 --> 3191.44
do you have any evidence for that

3187.52 --> 3195.28
i mean they might maybe they do do that

3191.44 --> 3198.0
they're like hey want amazon gift cards

3195.28 --> 3200.7200000000003
yeah keep trolling those flat earthers

3198.0 --> 3203.359
maybe that happens but yeah without any

3200.72 --> 3207.16
actual substantial proof

3203.359 --> 3207.16
that's just a rumor

3222.079 --> 3228.559
it's a joke but you never know

3224.96 --> 3228.559
why stop joking

3228.88 --> 3232.359
it's very confusing

3236.64 --> 3241.2799999999997
uh

3238.72 --> 3242.24
oh wait yeah you're of course in india

3241.28 --> 3244.3190000000004
so

3242.24 --> 3247.5589999999997
it's probably late for you right that

3244.319 --> 3247.5589999999997
makes sense

3256.4 --> 3260.64
report to death that's why they do the

3258.16 --> 3260.64
trolling

3262.16 --> 3266.48
or if they're bored to death that means

3264.319 --> 3269.52
that they are avoiding what they need to

3266.48 --> 3272.0
be doing with their lives

3269.52 --> 3274.4
boredom

3272.0 --> 3277.119
is a symptom

3274.4 --> 3280.319
of avoidance

3277.119 --> 3281.599
i know from experience

3280.319 --> 3284.64
right

3281.599 --> 3286.559
there's things that you come across

3284.64 --> 3290.24
you don't want to deal with that you

3286.559 --> 3291.599
don't want to learn you don't want to

3290.24 --> 3293.9199999999996
invest

3291.599 --> 3296.0
attention

3293.92 --> 3298.16
and you just don't want to know about it

3296.0 --> 3299.839
you want to forget about it well

3298.16 --> 3301.839
then you're going to end up getting

3299.839 --> 3305.119
bored

3301.839 --> 3307.2799999999997
and then you waste all your time

3305.119 --> 3309.839
because you think you are bored when

3307.28 --> 3312.3190000000004
you're actually just avoiding

3309.839 --> 3315.2799999999997
things that matter

3312.319 --> 3315.2799999999997
that's how i see it

3316.319 --> 3322.24
like to me boredom is kind of sloth it's

3319.839 --> 3324.799
a sin

3322.24 --> 3327.9199999999996
like acting on it

3324.799 --> 3331.0
moment you realize hey i'm bored you got

3327.92 --> 3331.0
a problem

3336.64 --> 3339.64
ugh

3362.559 --> 3368.3590000000004
ah yeah the trolls have arrived gadget

3365.119 --> 3368.359
that's right

3397.2 --> 3402.2
any globe rules today

3399.2 --> 3402.2
no

3409.68 --> 3413.1189999999997
like

3410.64 --> 3417.4
if there would be any glow proofs then

3413.119 --> 3417.4
why would they be trolling right

3418.559 --> 3424.2400000000002
they'd just be reveling in their proof

3420.88 --> 3424.2400000000002
and their references to it

3424.319 --> 3429.599
and then they would analyze how flat

3426.72 --> 3431.68
earthers are trying to avoid

3429.599 --> 3433.599
letting the proof sink in because the

3431.68 --> 3435.839
tide would have been turned

3433.599 --> 3437.6800000000003
right the flat earthers were actually

3435.839 --> 3440.0
wrong and trying to make it up to make

3437.68 --> 3442.0789999999997
it all seem flat because it supposedly

3440.0 --> 3444.96
really is

3442.079 --> 3447.92
problem though is that's not reality

3444.96 --> 3450.7200000000003
reality is the earth is flat

3447.92 --> 3454.88
they don't have any arguments

3450.72 --> 3456.24
most of them kind of realize that by now

3454.88 --> 3458.559
and they're just

3456.24 --> 3461.7599999999998
they don't want to know so they get

3458.559 --> 3464.559
bored and think oh let's just

3461.76 --> 3468.0
try to get on on their nerves

3464.559 --> 3471.0
on those that defeated us

3468.0 --> 3471.0
intellectually

3474.96 --> 3479.44
see there we go

3477.68 --> 3482.16
yeah

3479.44 --> 3483.92
i know i know you think you have proof

3482.16 --> 3485.92
that the earth is a globe

3483.92 --> 3488.7200000000003
but yeah when it really comes to it it's

3485.92 --> 3491.28
too it's too painful a process to put it

3488.72 --> 3493.5989999999997
back together again

3491.28 --> 3493.599
huh

3498.559 --> 3502.28
wow look at that

3503.44 --> 3507.48
yeah squirm for us fundies

3536.72 --> 3540.24
letter through

3539.119 --> 3541.359
yeah

3540.24 --> 3544.5589999999997
how about

3541.359 --> 3546.319
fast lines aside at extremely low

3544.559 --> 3548.559
observation height

3546.319 --> 3550.0
one foot observation height several

3548.559 --> 3552.079
miles away

3550.0 --> 3554.559
how does that work on a globe again

3552.079 --> 3556.96
oh yeah it should all be obstructed from

3554.559 --> 3558.96
view because the curve

3556.96 --> 3560.96
should be getting in the way if you were

3558.96 --> 3563.68
standing on the globe it doesn't there's

3560.96 --> 3566.319
no exponential drop behind a physical

3563.68 --> 3568.799
obstruction or also known as a geometric

3566.319 --> 3570.72
horizon at that super low observation

3568.799 --> 3572.72
height should be very close by that

3570.72 --> 3575.52
physical obstruction preventing you from

3572.72 --> 3578.0
seeing beyond the horizon

3575.52 --> 3580.88
but that doesn't actually happen black

3578.0 --> 3584.72
swan there's your flat earth proof

3580.88 --> 3588.2400000000002
you can see extreme distances at very

3584.72 --> 3590.799
very low observation height one foot

3588.24 --> 3593.359
there's only one logical conclusion you

3590.799 --> 3596.96
could draw involving geometry

3593.359 --> 3600.44
and that is there is no curve it's flat

3596.96 --> 3600.44
there you go

3604.24 --> 3608.72
the fraction of

3606.16 --> 3608.72
the [ __ ]

3612.24 --> 3616.319
and the roosters are going at it

3617.839 --> 3623.2
yeah yeah refraction terrestrial

3619.839 --> 3626.5589999999997
refraction that's my paradox it's mine

3623.2 --> 3628.96
it's my paradox baldwin is the only one

3626.559 --> 3633.52
legally allowed to use it

3628.96 --> 3633.52
because it's my paradox you understand

3633.68 --> 3635.9199999999996
if

3637.04 --> 3640.88
yes bex

3638.64 --> 3640.8799999999997
if

3641.2 --> 3646.24
terrestrial refraction

3643.599 --> 3647.6800000000003
existed

3646.24 --> 3650.799
then

3647.68 --> 3654.0
there would have never been any way

3650.799 --> 3656.319
to use observations to establish the

3654.0 --> 3658.16
actual radius through optical

3656.319 --> 3660.079
measurement

3658.16 --> 3662.72
even though the radius value is

3660.079 --> 3664.1600000000003
literally in the formula for terrestrial

3662.72 --> 3666.319
refraction

3664.16 --> 3667.7599999999998
it's called the arwenian paradox i

3666.319 --> 3670.48
discovered it

3667.76 --> 3673.3590000000004
a couple of years ago

3670.48 --> 3675.359
and i was honored by receiving that name

3673.359 --> 3677.839
from nathan for it

3675.359 --> 3679.5989999999997
making it my paradox and it was at first

3677.839 --> 3682.0789999999997
kind of unnerving

3679.599 --> 3685.3590000000004
to have to see that happen but i accept

3682.079 --> 3689.3590000000004
it now it is my paradox

3685.359 --> 3691.04
if terrestrial refraction existed

3689.359 --> 3693.44
then

3691.04 --> 3696.079
it can't exit yeah it couldn't have

3693.44 --> 3698.0
because where did you get the radius

3696.079 --> 3701.44
how did you get the radius because you

3698.0 --> 3702.4
can't measure it if light is bending

3701.44 --> 3705.04
not

3702.4 --> 3706.96
making making things not

3705.04 --> 3710.44
where they physically are because the

3706.96 --> 3710.44
light is bending

3712.799 --> 3716.48
then the radius could never have been

3714.4 --> 3717.92
established

3716.48 --> 3721.2
by the way it isn't

3717.92 --> 3721.2000000000003
it's just presupposed

3722.0 --> 3728.079
it's always presupposed like you have to

3724.24 --> 3730.0
presuppose r if you're a glober because

3728.079 --> 3731.44
you can't get it you can't get the

3730.0 --> 3734.16
radius you can't get it through

3731.44 --> 3737.2000000000003
measurement because when you try that it

3734.16 --> 3739.359
turns out it's not a ball

3737.2 --> 3740.8799999999997
you can see too far at low observation

3739.359 --> 3743.68
height

3740.88 --> 3745.52
it's geometrically not a ball so oh then

3743.68 --> 3747.68
terrestrial refraction

3745.52 --> 3750.4
well that's cool and all

3747.68 --> 3753.2799999999997
but that means that you no longer

3750.4 --> 3756.88
have any ability to actually establish

3753.28 --> 3758.96
the radius value through measurement

3756.88 --> 3761.599
even though you use it in the

3758.96 --> 3765.799
terrestrial refraction formula that you

3761.599 --> 3765.799
assume has to exist

3772.799 --> 3777.599
so yeah

3774.4 --> 3780.88
refraction that's really cool and all

3777.599 --> 3783.119
doesn't actually work though

3780.88 --> 3785.2000000000003
you literally end up in a very close

3783.119 --> 3786.559
proximity paradox

3785.2 --> 3788.0789999999997
where you're going to end up switching

3786.559 --> 3793.039
back and forth back and forth back and

3788.079 --> 3793.039
forth never finding solid ground ever

3794.799 --> 3799.2
it can't be

3796.48 --> 3800.4
the horizon can't be refracted to seem

3799.2 --> 3802.319
flat

3800.4 --> 3804.1600000000003
because if it were that you could have

3802.319 --> 3805.44
never gotten

3804.16 --> 3806.64
the radius

3805.44 --> 3808.839
value

3806.64 --> 3813.7599999999998
through

3808.839 --> 3817.68
measurement in order to formulate

3813.76 --> 3817.6800000000003
the terrestrial refraction formula

3817.92 --> 3820.4
try it

3820.88 --> 3826.88
flew around the world oh you mean in a

3824.0 --> 3828.48
circle in a straight line through a loop

3826.88 --> 3830.48
yeah it didn't go over any curve though

3828.48 --> 3832.079
it just flew in a straight line a

3830.48 --> 3834.16
geometric straight line that's what

3832.079 --> 3835.8390000000004
planes do they all fly in geometric

3834.16 --> 3837.2799999999997
straight lines when they go long

3835.839 --> 3839.0389999999998
distances

3837.28 --> 3840.88
they don't actually go around a curve

3839.039 --> 3842.1600000000003
they make no turns they don't go

3840.88 --> 3844.88
downward

3842.16 --> 3847.68
over the long run they don't dive down

3844.88 --> 3850.0
they all go straight so yeah you wanted

3847.68 --> 3852.64
to use that as proof

3850.0 --> 3855.52
well that's just a claim they've gone a

3852.64 --> 3858.0
distance around a sphere

3855.52 --> 3862.079
because you assume that distance takes

3858.0 --> 3864.4
place on a sphere even though the actual

3862.079 --> 3864.4
path

3864.559 --> 3869.599
and the turns and the maneuvers don't

3867.28 --> 3871.28
show it's actually moving around the

3869.599 --> 3874.4
curve

3871.28 --> 3876.799
it shows it moves all in a straight line

3874.4 --> 3878.88
you see

3876.799 --> 3881.68
and besides flying around what you

3878.88 --> 3882.96
presuppose is a sphere is not actually a

3881.68 --> 3885.44
measurement

3882.96 --> 3889.119
of the geometry

3885.44 --> 3890.4
you cannot derive an r value

3889.119 --> 3893.44
from just

3890.4 --> 3893.44
moving a distance

3893.839 --> 3896.96
sorry that doesn't work

3897.039 --> 3902.88
you have to actually measure something

3900.319 --> 3904.48
like well the horizon because hey if the

3902.88 --> 3906.319
earth was a sphere

3904.48 --> 3907.68
then the horizon would be geometric and

3906.319 --> 3909.68
you would be able to measure it like

3907.68 --> 3912.3999999999996
that oh wait terrestrial refraction you

3909.68 --> 3915.1189999999997
say yeah now there is no more way to

3912.4 --> 3916.88
establish the radius

3915.119 --> 3919.28
yeah you don't have it anymore you can

3916.88 --> 3921.52
only presuppose it once you

3919.28 --> 3923.8390000000004
establish terrestrial refraction in your

3921.52 --> 3923.839
argument

3929.119 --> 3932.799
as sophia smith it doesn't work

3932.96 --> 3937.92
you already claim terrestrial refraction

3935.28 --> 3939.8390000000004
whatever a plane sees

3937.92 --> 3942.4
at the horizon

3939.839 --> 3945.799
it's irrelevant

3942.4 --> 3945.799
because geometrically

3946.16 --> 3953.1189999999997
it's not where you see it

3949.119 --> 3953.119
if you claim terrestro refraction

3953.28 --> 3956.96
it's your claim dude chick

3956.0 --> 3959.599
lady

3956.96 --> 3961.2
sofia smith is your claim you claim

3959.599 --> 3962.88
terrestrial refraction but you don't

3961.2 --> 3966.24
seem to understand what terrestrial

3962.88 --> 3966.2400000000002
refraction really does

3966.319 --> 3970.88
it visually bends

3969.359 --> 3973.359
sites

3970.88 --> 3975.92
where they're not supposed to be

3973.359 --> 3978.96
and once you do that you can't rely on

3975.92 --> 3981.839
your sights anymore to make geometric

3978.96 --> 3984.799
points because what you see is not in

3981.839 --> 3986.64
the place it's supposed to be

3984.799 --> 3988.96
so yeah you want you want your claim

3986.64 --> 3990.96
terrestrial refraction

3988.96 --> 3993.44
you can't make an argument oh look with

3990.96 --> 3995.839
this plane saw the other plane at the

3993.44 --> 3998.48
horizon yeah that doesn't matter anymore

3995.839 --> 3999.92
because what you see is not in the place

3998.48 --> 4002.48
where you see it

3999.92 --> 4004.839
it becomes a terrestrial refraction

4002.48 --> 4007.2
it completely negates all those

4004.839 --> 4009.68
arguments once you claim to restore

4007.2 --> 4012.0789999999997
refraction you can't use optics and

4009.68 --> 4013.7599999999998
sites anymore to make geometric claims

4012.079 --> 4016.76
don't you understand this is basic

4013.76 --> 4016.76
mechanics

4033.599 --> 4038.96
so yeah you can't have your

4036.88 --> 4041.44
terrestrial refraction and then make

4038.96 --> 4043.839
geometric claims you can't do both

4041.44 --> 4043.839
it doesn't

4046.839 --> 4051.52
work sixty thousand dollars for one

4049.52 --> 4052.72
kilogram sat like dude

4051.52 --> 4055.119
what a waste

4052.72 --> 4056.9599999999996
i'd invest that in gold

4055.119 --> 4058.559
and then keep the gold

4056.96 --> 4059.92
that would be much better investment

4058.559 --> 4062.4
than

4059.92 --> 4064.96
building something and

4062.4 --> 4068.4
having it chugged somewhere

4064.96 --> 4068.4
in the bermuda triangle

4071.76 --> 4075.599
seems like such a waste of all that

4073.44 --> 4078.48
money

4075.599 --> 4080.6400000000003
try it yeah no thanks no i'll i'll just

4078.48 --> 4082.319
use that money and buy gold and then

4080.64 --> 4084.319
half that gold and then you can prove

4082.319 --> 4086.24
like i have gold i actually have

4084.319 --> 4087.92
something real here

4086.24 --> 4089.5989999999997
from all that money

4087.92 --> 4092.559
isn't that cool

4089.599 --> 4094.96
not just a story

4092.559 --> 4098.4800000000005
of how something fantastical supposedly

4094.96 --> 4098.4800000000005
happened because of your investment

4099.359 --> 4102.719
like investing

4100.88 --> 4105.12
60 000

4102.719 --> 4108.2390000000005
dollars for a satellite

4105.12 --> 4109.839
is like investing money into the making

4108.239 --> 4112.08
of a movie

4109.839 --> 4114.159
except the movie is there to pretend to

4112.08 --> 4117.799
be real

4114.159 --> 4117.799
that's what it is

4124.0 --> 4127.719
it seems so triggered

4132.319 --> 4135.759
i'm sorry am i

4134.159 --> 4138.48
my solid

4135.759 --> 4141.04
straight to the point hardcore worked

4138.48 --> 4145.2789999999995
out reason out well balanced arguments a

4141.04 --> 4146.4
little too much for you sophia smith

4145.279 --> 4148.799000000001
yeah

4146.4 --> 4149.5199999999995
yeah maybe you should stop projecting

4148.799 --> 4152.4
and

4149.52 --> 4154.88
do what you say like actual investment

4152.4 --> 4158.0
into insight and knowledge

4154.88 --> 4159.04
kissy face yeah maybe you should do that

4158.0 --> 4160.88
i have

4159.04 --> 4163.5199999999995
that's how i know

4160.88 --> 4166.08
these arguments because i paid attention

4163.52 --> 4166.080000000001
i care

4166.159 --> 4170.639999999999
right i understand mechanics that are

4168.64 --> 4172.2390000000005
involved you don't seem to

4170.64 --> 4174.0
you haven't disclaimed terrestrial

4172.239 --> 4176.4
refraction you were so easy to claim

4174.0 --> 4177.92
that i've explained to you the actual

4176.4 --> 4179.759
consequence of that you haven't even

4177.92 --> 4182.08
addressed it you're just moving on to

4179.759 --> 4183.44
the next subject oh satellites money oh

4182.08 --> 4185.5199999999995
that proves it

4183.44 --> 4188.239
learn knowledge yeah i just described to

4185.52 --> 4190.719
you knowledge knowledge that involves

4188.239 --> 4192.879999999999
those things you're ignoring it maybe

4190.719 --> 4194.56
you should stop ignoring

4192.88 --> 4196.400000000001
the arguments

4194.56 --> 4199.120000000001
and listen

4196.4 --> 4202.679
ever consider that

4199.12 --> 4202.679
probably not

4207.44 --> 4211.839999999999
i said nothing about atmospheric

4209.44 --> 4214.639999999999
refraction no that's terrestrial

4211.84 --> 4218.400000000001
refraction atmospheric refraction

4214.64 --> 4221.04
officially is negligible at all times

4218.4 --> 4223.04
at all times negligible the amount of

4221.04 --> 4224.64
actual refraction not terrestrial

4223.04 --> 4226.48
refraction which is a machination a

4224.64 --> 4227.84
globe machination that's the refraction

4226.48 --> 4229.759999999999
you were referring to

4227.84 --> 4233.12
right because that

4229.76 --> 4235.12
is not an insignificant deviation actual

4233.12 --> 4237.679
refraction which is basically the

4235.12 --> 4239.84
distortion of light

4237.679 --> 4242.56
because of the preponderance of material

4239.84 --> 4245.04
it's moving through

4242.56 --> 4246.719
it distorts it yeah

4245.04 --> 4248.48
that refraction

4246.719 --> 4251.6
in the air

4248.48 --> 4253.919999999999
is negligible the amount of geometric

4251.6 --> 4256.08
deviation

4253.92 --> 4260.719
that the light distortion of refraction

4256.08 --> 4264.32
causes is negligible that means less

4260.719 --> 4264.32
than one percent like

4264.52 --> 4270.159000000001
0.05 or something i don't know exactly

4267.44 --> 4272.639999999999
it's very low insignificant

4270.159 --> 4274.879999999999
negligible when something is negligible

4272.64 --> 4277.52
it's basically insignificant

4274.88 --> 4279.6
that means you don't have to account for

4277.52 --> 4281.679
it because the deviation is so minor

4279.6 --> 4284.719
it's insignificant it doesn't matter

4281.679 --> 4285.679
negligible that's actual refraction

4284.719 --> 4287.92
yes

4285.679 --> 4290.159
now terrestrial refraction is not the

4287.92 --> 4290.159
same

4290.239 --> 4294.959999999999
it's a machination and it has r the

4293.36 --> 4298.5599999999995
radius value

4294.96 --> 4301.199
and grained in its formula

4298.56 --> 4303.360000000001
it's a different thing

4301.199 --> 4305.28
and it's the thing you would need in

4303.36 --> 4308.32
order to justify

4305.28 --> 4311.84
why the horizon you see

4308.32 --> 4314.639999999999
is not in its correct geometric position

4311.84 --> 4318.32
when you presuppose a globe

4314.64 --> 4318.320000000001
yeah it's not the same refraction

4318.48 --> 4322.718999999999
you do understand that right we've been

4320.159 --> 4326.32
only like talking about this like every

4322.719 --> 4326.32
day for the last three years

4326.84 --> 4330.719
everywhere

4328.4 --> 4332.5599999999995
flat earth debates on my channel

4330.719 --> 4336.52
dedicated subjects

4332.56 --> 4336.52
all that right

4345.84 --> 4349.84
no it's not

4347.44 --> 4351.678999999999
no that you literally just pull that out

4349.84 --> 4355.12
of your ass

4351.679 --> 4356.64
that's not atmospheric refraction at all

4355.12 --> 4358.4
doesn't have anything to do with

4356.64 --> 4361.12
celestial objects

4358.4 --> 4363.5199999999995
it doesn't apply to celestia object

4361.12 --> 4366.5599999999995
that's where celestial refraction come

4363.52 --> 4369.4400000000005
you don't seem to know your lore

4366.56 --> 4371.6
maybe you should

4369.44 --> 4374.639999999999
get some knowledge about this subject

4371.6 --> 4376.719
before you literally conjure up made-up

4374.64 --> 4377.84
[ __ ] on the spot that i can

4376.719 --> 4380.96
literally

4377.84 --> 4383.52
identify as made-up [ __ ] on the spot

4380.96 --> 4386.32
yeah that is a definition it's just not

4383.52 --> 4388.88
any official definition has nothing to

4386.32 --> 4391.44
do with actual refraction

4388.88 --> 4395.52
of any sort you literally just made it

4391.44 --> 4399.28
up you sofia smith made that [ __ ] up

4395.52 --> 4401.92
just like akumu virus

4399.28 --> 4404.159
on the thursday show

4401.92 --> 4406.96
made up

4404.159 --> 4409.12
that radii can be bent

4406.96 --> 4410.8
he just stated that and then he doubled

4409.12 --> 4413.12
down and then he tried to find it out

4410.8 --> 4414.4800000000005
there and it wasn't out there because he

4413.12 --> 4418.0
made it up

4414.48 --> 4418.0
like you just did

4422.48 --> 4428.159
you just made it up

4425.52 --> 4429.1990000000005
i've researched this subject

4428.159 --> 4431.759999999999
a lot

4429.199 --> 4433.12
like set with the data under my nose

4431.76 --> 4436.08
trying to find

4433.12 --> 4439.199
details in it further details to study

4436.08 --> 4442.08
like on a daily basis for like a year

4439.199 --> 4444.48
this very specific subject not an item

4442.08 --> 4446.159
that came past and like i take a glitch

4444.48 --> 4449.678999999999
look at it and satisfied yeah i know

4446.159 --> 4453.28
this no no like every day every day

4449.679 --> 4455.92
every day every day every day

4453.28 --> 4457.759999999999
like two hours a day every day for like

4455.92 --> 4459.84
a year

4457.76 --> 4461.6
getting faced with that information and

4459.84 --> 4463.4400000000005
the types of refraction looking it up

4461.6 --> 4464.159000000001
looking up in dictionaries looking it up

4463.44 --> 4465.44
in

4464.159 --> 4467.199
wiki

4465.44 --> 4470.4
yeah i know what the [ __ ] i'm talking

4467.199 --> 4472.96
about what you said is made up [ __ ]

4470.4 --> 4475.28
you don't have any references you made

4472.96 --> 4475.28
it up

4477.199 --> 4481.4
when people go like that just

4485.84 --> 4490.88
yeah yeah

4487.84 --> 4494.6
all right i'm gonna take a break

4490.88 --> 4494.6
be back in two minutes

4575.92 --> 4579.32
and i'm back

4585.28 --> 4590.32
you could do it

4586.87 --> 4593.28
[Laughter]

4590.32 --> 4593.28
oh my god

4593.76 --> 4598.4800000000005
yeah

4595.36 --> 4598.48
get the [ __ ] out here

4599.76 --> 4603.6
it's the same [ __ ] troll it's the same

4602.32 --> 4607.799999999999
person

4603.6 --> 4607.8
the same one that got banned

4617.12 --> 4622.719
right but it was funny while it lasted

4619.84 --> 4625.96
yeah i think so to too terry 306 i think

4622.719 --> 4625.96
you're right

4649.04 --> 4654.36
been telling since 15 minutes all right

4675.12 --> 4680.64

4678.96 --> 4682.88
it was funny though

4680.64 --> 4682.88
right

4683.76 --> 4687.4400000000005
it was worth going through it again

4690.159 --> 4694.08
and it's it's kind of nice to like open

4692.159 --> 4697.199
that can again i rarely open it it's

4694.08 --> 4699.199
just i keep that information in storage

4697.199 --> 4701.839999999999
in the back of my mind it's there i got

4699.199 --> 4703.28
it in a jar it's sealed it'll last

4701.84 --> 4705.360000000001
forever

4703.28 --> 4708.32
and then sometimes when

4705.36 --> 4709.599999999999
some numpty comes out of the

4708.32 --> 4712.239
woods

4709.6 --> 4714.56
i can just like open the can like it's

4712.239 --> 4717.28
all fresh

4714.56 --> 4720.159000000001
like i i just figured all that out in

4717.28 --> 4722.0
detail i just memorized it even though i

4720.159 --> 4724.639999999999
haven't really

4722.0 --> 4724.64
in a while

4728.719 --> 4731.719

4756.719 --> 4758.96
right

4759.76 --> 4766.159000000001

and this guy is one of them

4777.6 --> 4782.159000000001
i should know yeah

4780.159 --> 4784.32

4782.159 --> 4788.12
because i have to

4784.32 --> 4788.12
it's for my own survival

4794.8 --> 4797.8
so

4812.88 --> 4815.88
ah

4818.88 --> 4825.04
trolls got to get sharper bring act it's

4821.44 --> 4827.199

4825.04 --> 4828.96
that's what you're gonna say

4827.199 --> 4830.5599999999995
that's yeah but then they wouldn't be

4828.96 --> 4832.96
trolls anymore

4830.56 --> 4834.2390000000005
that's not what trolls do trolls are

4832.96 --> 4837.76
loud

4834.239 --> 4840.08
noisy ignorant and they throw [ __ ] at

4837.76 --> 4840.08
you

4840.159 --> 4847.679
they make things stink by throwing [ __ ]

4843.36 --> 4850.239
at it that's what trolls do

4847.679 --> 4851.92
they go somewhere and they leave a big

4850.239 --> 4853.839999999999
steamy

4851.92 --> 4856.56
pile of dump

4853.84 --> 4856.56
that's what they do

4857.04 --> 4862.639
they leave a huge dump so yeah to say oh

4860.639 --> 4865.679
they gotta get informed and sharp or

4862.639 --> 4867.6
bring actual arguments are you real

4865.679 --> 4871.2390000000005
if they had any such things then they

4867.6 --> 4871.2390000000005
wouldn't be trolls

4886.84 --> 4889.679
wow

4888.8 --> 4891.92
dude

4889.679 --> 4894.4
what you

4891.92 --> 4896.719
you think that's gonna do something

4894.4 --> 4901.44
i literally just talk about those types

4896.719 --> 4904.2390000000005
of there's nothing you can do and say

4901.44 --> 4908.239
right the only thing you're gonna do

4904.239 --> 4910.4
is one day get yourself killed

4908.239 --> 4911.678999999999
you understand that with that attitude

4910.4 --> 4914.4
one day

4911.679 --> 4917.84
you're gonna act like that by accident

4914.4 --> 4920.239
to somebody's face and they're literally

4917.84 --> 4921.76
going to take your skull and bash it

4920.239 --> 4924.48
into the wall

4921.76 --> 4926.719
until it cracks open you understand

4924.48 --> 4928.48
that's what's going to happen one day

4926.719 --> 4930.96
with that attitude

4928.48 --> 4933.919999999999
it's not even going to be me doing it

4930.96 --> 4936.639
it's just you

4933.92 --> 4937.52
everybody hates people that act like

4936.639 --> 4941.92
this

4937.52 --> 4941.92
they don't even care who they acted too

4942.159 --> 4948.48
doesn't matter when you get that

4944.159 --> 4948.48
disgusting everybody just hates you

4949.04 --> 4955.36
and you're now hiding behind internet id

4952.0 --> 4958.08
yeah internet anonymity

4955.36 --> 4961.12
and one day you're you you're gonna get

4958.08 --> 4963.28
so used to this so that that's normal to

4961.12 --> 4965.28
you now that you'll just act like that

4963.28 --> 4968.239
to somebody's face

4965.28 --> 4970.159
and when that happens they're gonna kill

4968.239 --> 4972.5599999999995
you [ __ ]

4970.159 --> 4976.04
you understand that [ __ ]

4972.56 --> 4976.04
it's gonna happen

4986.719 --> 4989.04
ah

4998.32 --> 5001.679
i'm talking to mike fox logical

5000.32 --> 5004.88
conclusion

5001.679 --> 5007.52
who's sock trolling me with just at home

5004.88 --> 5012.52
[ __ ] trying to think he can get

5007.52 --> 5012.52
in my feelings somehow it's pathetic

5030.48 --> 5037.959999999999
who told you i will visit yeah i bet you

5033.36 --> 5037.96
need you probably need that

5042.639 --> 5048.32
you know that i actually for a for a bit

5045.76 --> 5049.1990000000005
even like work there it didn't last very

5048.32 --> 5051.5199999999995
long

5049.199 --> 5054.638999999999
it's part of my study

5051.52 --> 5057.84
because i was gonna actually like

5054.639 --> 5059.92
at some point was a 2002

5057.84 --> 5062.639
i'm gonna study to get into mental

5059.92 --> 5065.36
health care but i i found another way of

5062.639 --> 5067.92
doing it outside of the system

5065.36 --> 5069.599999999999
it's what's happening right now

5067.92 --> 5072.88
i apply

5069.6 --> 5074.4800000000005
that need and my skills here

5072.88 --> 5077.12
because this

5074.48 --> 5079.04
is partially mental health care and like

5077.12 --> 5081.84
how do we deal with people that are

5079.04 --> 5084.639
completely out of control

5081.84 --> 5086.08
how do you tame how to control demon

5084.639 --> 5088.96
people

5086.08 --> 5091.679
they've just lost everything lost grip

5088.96 --> 5093.76
on their reality on their feelings and

5091.679 --> 5096.639
they're just raging and

5093.76 --> 5099.6
being nasty demons all day anonymously

5096.639 --> 5100.639
in other people's chats

5099.6 --> 5102.719
yeah

5100.639 --> 5103.84
now i do this now i

5102.719 --> 5105.44
study

5103.84 --> 5108.400000000001
maniacs

5105.44 --> 5109.599999999999
and nasty freaks

5108.4 --> 5111.36
study them

5109.6 --> 5113.84
that's why i don't just straight out

5111.36 --> 5116.5599999999995
delete everything

5113.84 --> 5117.76
right i'm not afraid of maniacs i know

5116.56 --> 5120.0
they're out there i know they're a

5117.76 --> 5122.96
systemic problem

5120.0 --> 5125.96
and i tend intend to deal with that

5122.96 --> 5125.96
problem

5126.4 --> 5130.96
and not just

5127.92 --> 5130.96
in my vicinity

5133.52 --> 5137.92
i'm gonna get this

5136.0 --> 5140.08
mental plague

5137.92 --> 5143.08
under control somehow one way or the

5140.08 --> 5143.08
other

5164.639 --> 5167.639
ah

5180.8 --> 5186.159000000001
yeah llp i know i know but it's just

5183.12 --> 5186.159
gonna go away again

5191.76 --> 5197.52
but dude every time this [ __ ] happens

5194.239 --> 5199.919999999999
just remember just visualize

5197.52 --> 5201.92
whoever this guy is

5199.92 --> 5203.04
he's probably pretty miserable with who

5201.92 --> 5205.52
he is

5203.04 --> 5207.28
but he's choosing to make that the

5205.52 --> 5209.52
world's problem

5207.28 --> 5212.239
when you do that

5209.52 --> 5214.159000000001
reality ends to tends to maneuver you

5212.239 --> 5215.919999999999
into position

5214.159 --> 5219.92
where your

5215.92 --> 5223.1990000000005
unwillingness to deal with yourself

5219.92 --> 5225.04
and to actually learn to be useful

5223.199 --> 5226.0
in some way instead of just a detriment

5225.04 --> 5228.8
to everyone

5226.0 --> 5230.48
it maneuvers you into a position

5228.8 --> 5231.6
where you literally

5230.48 --> 5233.839999999999
die

5231.6 --> 5237.1990000000005
somebody does actually

5233.84 --> 5239.84
bash your skull in at some point

5237.199 --> 5241.839999999999
because you thought it was normal

5239.84 --> 5243.84
you didn't realize that some people

5241.84 --> 5245.6
don't take kindly

5243.84 --> 5246.400000000001
the overt

5245.6 --> 5249.1990000000005
gay

5246.4 --> 5251.44
demon nasty people

5249.199 --> 5254.0
that'll say anything to try to get under

5251.44 --> 5256.239
your skin and think it's normal

5254.0 --> 5259.28
they're not going to be like people that

5256.239 --> 5261.36
hang around on the internet a lot

5259.28 --> 5263.44
and then when they see you act like that

5261.36 --> 5265.92
within like two meters distance of them

5263.44 --> 5268.159
they're gonna walk up to you grab you by

5265.92 --> 5270.159
the skull as you're stupid in your

5268.159 --> 5271.44
mobile all focused up and you just

5270.159 --> 5274.08
thought oh i'm just going to say that

5271.44 --> 5276.239
out loud and not look at him

5274.08 --> 5279.36
just pretend like i'm in the internet

5276.239 --> 5281.839999999999
still yo guess what no physical barrier

5279.36 --> 5284.639
there is going to grab your head

5281.84 --> 5286.88
and bash it into the wall until you're

5284.639 --> 5290.08
dead

5286.88 --> 5291.52
it's only natural

5290.08 --> 5294.239
so just

5291.52 --> 5296.159000000001
visualize that and then it's not all

5294.239 --> 5298.159
that bad you know that he's doing this

5296.159 --> 5299.679
because he's gonna pay

5298.159 --> 5301.839999999999
for what he's doing

5299.679 --> 5304.56
through logos through

5301.84 --> 5306.2390000000005
the natural consequences of your actions

5304.56 --> 5308.4800000000005
and the design

5306.239 --> 5311.44
taking it into account

5308.48 --> 5313.919999999999
and maneuvering you to a certain end

5311.44 --> 5313.919999999999
result

5320.96 --> 5324.159
we'll go to hell for it i don't know

5322.56 --> 5326.159000000001
about that

5324.159 --> 5329.28
like after he's dead

5326.159 --> 5331.679
i don't know where he'll go

5329.28 --> 5333.84
can't say anything about that

5331.679 --> 5337.4400000000005
but practically people that are like

5333.84 --> 5339.679
this they are in hell actually

5337.44 --> 5341.759999999999
they're experiencing health that's why

5339.679 --> 5344.2390000000005
they're a demon

5341.76 --> 5346.08
that's why they don't have the subtle

5344.239 --> 5348.0
senses anymore

5346.08 --> 5350.0
and they don't really appreciate life

5348.0 --> 5352.56
that more because they're all burned out

5350.0 --> 5354.159
because they're demonic so they are

5352.56 --> 5356.639
literally in hell

5354.159 --> 5359.92
and crushing their skull in the wall

5356.639 --> 5363.4800000000005
is actually god's mercy

5359.92 --> 5363.4800000000005
think about that

5373.36 --> 5379.759999999999
afterlife well look the whole afterlife

5376.159 --> 5382.0
ordeal doesn't have any thing to do with

5379.76 --> 5382.0
that

5382.08 --> 5387.36
you see

5384.239 --> 5389.04
there it may definitely be an afterlife

5387.36 --> 5391.599999999999
what it will be like

5389.04 --> 5394.48
i don't know i don't

5391.6 --> 5396.8
i think that people out there have been

5394.48 --> 5398.5599999999995
just assuming too much like they know

5396.8 --> 5401.12
what'll happen

5398.56 --> 5402.719
even based on like surreal experiences

5401.12 --> 5405.44
dark bull experience like i tried to

5402.719 --> 5409.199
figure that out through my dark world

5405.44 --> 5412.879999999999
never got to know never really

5409.199 --> 5418.199
but what i did get to find out is that

5412.88 --> 5418.1990000000005
you live heaven or hell in your life

5422.0 --> 5425.52
technically you could say you could

5424.0 --> 5427.52
consider that

5425.52 --> 5429.040000000001
in the world if so if you're like really

5427.52 --> 5431.1990000000005
pissed off at somebody or somebody's

5429.04 --> 5433.84
really pissed off of somebody else and

5431.199 --> 5436.08
they say go to hell that's not like oh

5433.84 --> 5437.4400000000005
die and then you get sent to hell no

5436.08 --> 5440.5599999999995
that's like

5437.44 --> 5443.839999999999
experience hell feel the burn

5440.56 --> 5445.52
of the consequences of what you do

5443.84 --> 5447.6
it's about the now

5445.52 --> 5450.159000000001
not about the afterlife when you say

5447.6 --> 5452.56
that go to hell

5450.159 --> 5454.96
that's like literally now while you're

5452.56 --> 5456.639
alive feel it

5454.96 --> 5459.8
isn't that what you would want when you

5456.639 --> 5459.8
say that

5463.52 --> 5466.8
i mean not saying it's a good thing to

5465.28 --> 5469.199
say that

5466.8 --> 5471.2390000000005
i'm just saying

5469.199 --> 5472.96
i don't see it

5471.239 --> 5475.759999999999
exclusively

5472.96 --> 5479.679
as like heaven and hell that that's only

5475.76 --> 5479.679
about like the afterlife

5480.239 --> 5484.239
it might have involvements like i'll bet

5482.56 --> 5486.56
you

5484.239 --> 5488.4
from a pragmatic standpoint it's gonna

5486.56 --> 5490.080000000001
reflect on you after your life you're

5488.4 --> 5491.5199999999995
gonna see your life back right that's a

5490.08 --> 5495.04
typical thing

5491.52 --> 5498.080000000001
so yeah whatever heaven or hell

5495.04 --> 5500.32
you've been contaminated with it's gonna

5498.08 --> 5502.48
you're gonna go through that

5500.32 --> 5504.4
and it all depends right you can go

5502.48 --> 5506.159
through hell practice like have a lot of

5504.4 --> 5507.12
challenge have a lot of misunderstanding

5506.159 --> 5510.159
like

5507.12 --> 5511.76
hurt but still have like

5510.159 --> 5513.199
you're no you know you're doing it for

5511.76 --> 5514.96
the right thing you're being strong for

5513.199 --> 5517.04
the right thing you're trying to change

5514.96 --> 5519.76
things for the better and then go

5517.04 --> 5521.5199999999995
through hell well that i bet you that's

5519.76 --> 5523.04
gonna reflect really well in the

5521.52 --> 5525.52
afterlife

5523.04 --> 5525.5199999999995
because

5525.76 --> 5530.8
you went through hell it didn't rub off

5528.239 --> 5533.5199999999995
on you you stood firm i bet you god's

5530.8 --> 5535.6
gonna appreciate that

5533.52 --> 5538.0
and so will you

5535.6 --> 5539.52
but if you go through hell and you lose

5538.0 --> 5543.04
it

5539.52 --> 5545.679
then you're gonna actually well

5543.04 --> 5547.199
experience that pain and the shame and

5545.679 --> 5549.92
the loss and

5547.199 --> 5552.0
abandoning and seeing yourself wither in

5549.92 --> 5552.96
the afterlife you're gonna feel that

5552.0 --> 5555.92
back

5552.96 --> 5558.56
right so heaven and hell

5555.92 --> 5558.56
in your life

5559.199 --> 5564.08
i'm very certain

5561.44 --> 5566.638999999999
you could definitely see it like that

5564.08 --> 5566.639
and i do

5572.0 --> 5575.76
it's all in this life heaven and hell

5574.08 --> 5578.719
mostly no

5575.76 --> 5582.159000000001
it's not mostly hell

5578.719 --> 5584.639
life is what you make of it

5582.159 --> 5587.199
and if you understand how

5584.639 --> 5589.1990000000005
the design works

5587.199 --> 5590.32
then

5589.199 --> 5594.32
you have

5590.32 --> 5596.639
a good compass a moral compass literally

5594.32 --> 5597.5199999999995
to find your way to

5596.639 --> 5599.1990000000005
heaven

5597.52 --> 5601.120000000001
because that's what you really want in

5599.199 --> 5603.12
the end most people unless you lose

5601.12 --> 5604.159
yourself so much that you start to long

5603.12 --> 5607.44
for hell

5604.159 --> 5609.44
and then you're gonna find that

5607.44 --> 5613.719
but i don't recommend it

5609.44 --> 5613.719
it's not very pleasant in hell

5616.159 --> 5621.36
most people that dwell in that those

5618.8 --> 5622.96
frequencies they become complete gammas

5621.36 --> 5625.04
and demons

5622.96 --> 5629.08
that's what happens

5625.04 --> 5629.08
and then you get numb down

5630.4 --> 5636.08
and you can't even sense the subtleties

5634.0 --> 5639.199
of heavenly experiences anymore it

5636.08 --> 5640.32
doesn't mean anything to you anymore

5639.199 --> 5642.4
see

5640.32 --> 5645.04
that's the dangers of experiencing hell

5642.4 --> 5647.44
it burns you out it burns your subtle

5645.04 --> 5651.12
senses so you can't really experience

5647.44 --> 5651.12
the subtleties of heaven anymore

5657.28 --> 5662.159
that's why you shouldn't dwell

5659.199 --> 5662.159
on the darkness

5663.52 --> 5666.88
right

5664.719 --> 5669.36
take a look maybe to understand but

5666.88 --> 5671.76
don't dwell don't obsess because it's

5669.36 --> 5673.839999999999
gonna burn you out literally it's going

5671.76 --> 5675.92
to burn out your spirit

5673.84 --> 5678.56
it's going to desensitize you you'll get

5675.92 --> 5680.4
used to things you shouldn't get used to

5678.56 --> 5682.159000000001
and then suddenly you don't see it

5680.4 --> 5684.5599999999995
anymore that you shouldn't have gotten

5682.159 --> 5686.719
used to it you just got used to it and

5684.56 --> 5689.04
now it becomes you

5686.719 --> 5690.639
you made the mistake you didn't realize

5689.04 --> 5692.56
the mistake

5690.639 --> 5695.52
you doubled down

5692.56 --> 5698.080000000001
and then you became the mistake that's

5695.52 --> 5703.159000000001
what that references

5698.08 --> 5703.159
see i i think about these things a lot

5722.08 --> 5726.639
experiences of heaven still more

5723.679 --> 5726.639
powerful than hell

5726.88 --> 5731.36
but only

5729.199 --> 5733.44
if you can accept them

5731.36 --> 5736.799999999999
if you have the senses

5733.44 --> 5739.839999999999
left to receive them you see

5736.8 --> 5743.159000000001
if you still have the sensibility

5739.84 --> 5743.159000000001
for it

5764.159 --> 5768.96
its effects on parallax what

5766.96 --> 5772.8
whoa

5768.96 --> 5772.8
that's very technical all of a sudden

5780.08 --> 5783.199
death

5781.04 --> 5786.4
the 3d model

5783.199 --> 5789.5199999999995
well i don't really have a the 3d model

5786.4 --> 5792.719
that fellow i mean i have references

5789.52 --> 5796.4400000000005
i have suspicions of what

5792.719 --> 5796.44
the layout is

5801.36 --> 5805.119
but i i don't really have like a solid

5804.08 --> 5807.36
model

5805.119 --> 5810.5599999999995
that i could say like oh yeah this thing

5807.36 --> 5812.639
is absolutely euclidean this is exactly

5810.56 --> 5816.320000000001
one on one on every part every part is

5812.639 --> 5817.1990000000005
exactly in the real position

5816.32 --> 5819.119
right

5817.199 --> 5822.48
that's a challenge

5819.119 --> 5825.28
because there seem to be irregularities

5822.48 --> 5828.4
within the entire layout

5825.28 --> 5831.28
yeah which kind of like very early on

5828.4 --> 5833.5199999999995
let's say six years ago even more

5831.28 --> 5837.28
brought me to the inside like

5833.52 --> 5837.280000000001
maybe space is not linear

5837.6 --> 5842.2390000000005
maybe it isn't just a perfect euclidean

5840.88 --> 5845.639
box

5842.239 --> 5845.638999999999
all of it

5854.0 --> 5859.28
don't know how that relates to parallax

5856.32 --> 5859.28
at all by the way but

5866.0 --> 5870.08
i might be onto something well

5868.96 --> 5872.08
yeah

5870.08 --> 5874.719
that's

5872.08 --> 5877.5199999999995
that's why i introduced it as a concept

5874.719 --> 5880.4
very early on in my flat earth talks

5877.52 --> 5882.719
it it was literally a part of my icon of

5880.4 --> 5883.759999999999
the time

5882.719 --> 5886.639
space

5883.76 --> 5886.639
isn't linear

5887.6 --> 5890.88
space is not linear

5891.28 --> 5894.92
that was the idea

5912.639 --> 5917.1990000000005
hey pj kershanks who are these soccer

5914.639 --> 5919.6
con idiots it's just one guy it's mike

5917.199 --> 5919.599999999999
fox

5920.639 --> 5924.92
he was extra triggered today

5936.719 --> 5942.2390000000005
whole model how long does it take

5939.119 --> 5944.48
well auto pilot

5942.239 --> 5946.159
may never happen

5944.48 --> 5949.759999999999
it might simply

5946.159 --> 5953.44
be impossible to have a

5949.76 --> 5958.08
euclidean representation of the space

5953.44 --> 5958.08
available to us in physical reality

5958.88 --> 5965.52
but yeah if we had

5962.08 --> 5968.239
world peace and wide availability like

5965.52 --> 5970.8
accessibility everywhere money

5968.239 --> 5974.239
technology available then we could like

5970.8 --> 5976.320000000001
do a really detailed measuring

5974.239 --> 5979.119
and accurate yeah an attempt to

5976.32 --> 5982.48
accurately model the entire layout

5979.119 --> 5984.239
including ocean bottom everything

5982.48 --> 5986.959999999999
then we would get somewhere we would

5984.239 --> 5988.32
start to see if space is not entirely

5986.96 --> 5991.199
linear

5988.32 --> 5993.36
if literally you start measuring

5991.199 --> 5995.36
it's all euclidean and then suddenly you

5993.36 --> 5997.36
end up like uh

5995.36 --> 5999.5199999999995
what the hell

5997.36 --> 6001.759999999999
we went out in a straight line and then

5999.52 --> 6003.92
certainly ended up crossing or something

6001.76 --> 6006.320000000001
right that shouldn't be possible if it's

6003.92 --> 6008.4
all euclidean right you'll start to

6006.32 --> 6009.679
notice those types of

6008.4 --> 6012.719
issues

6009.679 --> 6014.639
in the measuring up process

6012.719 --> 6016.32
so yeah i've thought about it a lot but

6014.639 --> 6018.400000000001
it doesn't mean that

6016.32 --> 6021.4
it's actually going to happen anytime

6018.4 --> 6021.4
soon

6037.52 --> 6041.119000000001
damn it i ran out of tea

6041.44 --> 6044.44
ah

6052.56 --> 6055.56
um

6067.76 --> 6071.719
man there's a huge delay

6075.98 --> 6079.08
[Music]

6090.48 --> 6094.718999999999
hmm you're getting some interfacing

6092.159 --> 6096.638999999999
problems pj crew shank that sucks

6094.719 --> 6098.719
dude yesterday when i was watching the

6096.639 --> 6101.28
premiere on flat earth debates it was

6098.719 --> 6103.6
constantly interrupting

6101.28 --> 6104.5599999999995
constantly stalling and i even i almost

6103.6 --> 6107.679
forgot

6104.56 --> 6109.280000000001
i noticed a really weird pattern

6107.679 --> 6111.679
should have recorded it

6109.28 --> 6113.28
but i had like two different browsers

6111.679 --> 6116.96
open right

6113.28 --> 6119.679
firefox browser and chrome browser

6116.96 --> 6122.159
and it had in both playing

6119.679 --> 6124.159
the same premiere

6122.159 --> 6126.159
and you yeah because when it was played

6124.159 --> 6127.599999999999
you could it was like slightly off face

6126.159 --> 6130.4
is very normal so you would hear like

6127.6 --> 6133.1990000000005
the metallic kind of echo sound right

6130.4 --> 6135.92
every time it started stalling

6133.199 --> 6138.32
they both started stalling on exactly

6135.92 --> 6140.88
the same time

6138.32 --> 6143.599999999999
and then turned on exactly the same time

6140.88 --> 6143.6
every time

6144.48 --> 6148.119
that was weird

6151.04 --> 6157.28
it's almost like it was actually

6154.8 --> 6160.159000000001
just stalled on purpose

6157.28 --> 6162.08
and not actually a connection issue

6160.159 --> 6164.5599999999995
because if it was a connection issue

6162.08 --> 6166.4
then every browser should have its own

6164.56 --> 6168.88
separate

6166.4 --> 6170.719
waiting row issue

6168.88 --> 6172.08
and then start stalling at different

6170.719 --> 6175.28
times but they

6172.08 --> 6176.639
stalled every time perfectly synchronous

6175.28 --> 6179.759999999999
perfectly

6176.639 --> 6182.719
for like a half hour straight it was

6179.76 --> 6184.400000000001
like what is this

6182.719 --> 6187.119
that was weird

6184.4 --> 6190.759999999999
i should have recorded it but it just

6187.119 --> 6190.759999999999
it was kind of late

6198.48 --> 6201.919999999999
i don't know if that's happening over

6199.92 --> 6205.84
here too if you guys are experiencing

6201.92 --> 6205.84
any stalling like that

6222.239 --> 6227.759999999999
every browser is different yeah except

6224.639 --> 6229.1990000000005
they stalled exactly the same time

6227.76 --> 6231.4400000000005
constantly

6229.199 --> 6233.28
that makes no sense it wasn't the same

6231.44 --> 6235.28
browser it wasn't like two winners of

6233.28 --> 6238.159
the same browser no it was two different

6235.28 --> 6240.0
browsers and they both stalled

6238.159 --> 6243.679
synchronistically

6240.0 --> 6246.48
synchronously every single time

6243.679 --> 6248.08
that makes no sense that's not natural

6246.48 --> 6250.799999999999
stalling

6248.08 --> 6253.28
that's an artificially an artificial

6250.8 --> 6255.52
delay interference

6253.28 --> 6257.5199999999995
otherwise it would never stall synchro

6255.52 --> 6261.2390000000005
asynchronously

6257.52 --> 6261.2390000000005
that makes no sense

6264.88 --> 6270.4800000000005
it's a computer issue what do you mean

6267.679 --> 6270.4800000000005
a premiere

6271.92 --> 6275.84
how is that a computer issue

6278.239 --> 6283.36
it's literally premiered from the google

6280.719 --> 6285.6
machine it's not premiering from your

6283.36 --> 6288.08
computer

6285.6 --> 6291.280000000001
the entire thing is uploaded to google

6288.08 --> 6291.28
then it streams

6298.0 --> 6303.36
you need big gpu to run too what are you

6300.639 --> 6306.400000000001
talking about i was taught i was using

6303.36 --> 6307.759999999999
two browsers to watch the premiere

6306.4 --> 6309.199
stream i

6307.76 --> 6311.1990000000005
he wasn't

6309.199 --> 6312.799999999999
he wasn't even there it's a premiere it

6311.199 --> 6315.119
was not a live show

6312.8 --> 6317.6
it was not being live generated

6315.119 --> 6320.48
it was a premiere you upload it to

6317.6 --> 6322.639
google then it streams it

6320.48 --> 6326.36
has nothing to do with cp

6322.639 --> 6326.36
cpu issues

6335.44 --> 6338.44
gpu

6348.8 --> 6353.28
anyway yeah that happened i almost

6350.639 --> 6354.96
forgot about it it was weird

6353.28 --> 6355.84
i'm gonna check if it's gonna happen

6354.96 --> 6357.92
again

6355.84 --> 6360.32
because i think there might be just

6357.92 --> 6364.639
literally an artificial delay put on

6360.32 --> 6364.639
nathan's premieres by google

6367.6 --> 6372.159000000001
because this has been happening for a

6369.52 --> 6376.639
while that weird stalling interruption

6372.159 --> 6376.638999999999
any premier it makes no sense

6384.48 --> 6389.759999999999
no george sanford it isn't

6387.6 --> 6392.56
it's a premiere it's not a live stream

6389.76 --> 6392.56
george sanford

6393.04 --> 6398.44
it isn't

6394.88 --> 6398.4400000000005
nathan's computer

6410.639 --> 6413.88
my computer

6415.119 --> 6417.44
what

6422.719 --> 6427.88
that doesn't really make any sense

6424.88 --> 6427.88
either

6433.84 --> 6437.76
oh hello

6435.28 --> 6439.679
linux

6437.76 --> 6440.84
having trouble finding my channel yeah i

6439.679 --> 6443.6
bet

6440.84 --> 6445.84
you yeah you have to wait through all

6443.6 --> 6448.0
the troll garbage first and there's a

6445.84 --> 6449.92
lot of it

6448.0 --> 6451.199
do i have two computers running no i

6449.92 --> 6453.92
don't

6451.199 --> 6456.159
no i don't it's one computer it's really

6453.92 --> 6458.159
basic

6456.159 --> 6461.28
i mean it's a pretty good computer i

6458.159 --> 6461.28
don't have issues

6462.08 --> 6465.88
it's not my computer

6480.719 --> 6484.56
i mean

6482.4 --> 6487.199
i don't think i've even ever with this

6484.56 --> 6488.4800000000005
computer went over 50

6487.199 --> 6492.4
gpu

6488.48 --> 6494.879999999999
cpu activity ever like ever and that

6492.4 --> 6496.638999999999
includes playing

6494.88 --> 6501.36
two games at the same time while

6496.639 --> 6501.36
watching some live stream etc like no

6503.04 --> 6507.48
it's not my computer issues

6516.96 --> 6521.76
a lack of ram

6519.44 --> 6521.759999999999
dude

6523.36 --> 6526.639
i have so much freaking ram in this

6525.6 --> 6530.4800000000005
thing

6526.639 --> 6530.4800000000005
i literally overkilled it

6531.04 --> 6536.28
let's see what what is the freaking ram

6532.96 --> 6536.28
on this thing

6543.92 --> 6547.28
or do i check that again

6547.92 --> 6550.92
e

6567.04 --> 6571.28
no that's not it uh hold on

6575.44 --> 6582.119
is this it no

6578.239 --> 6582.119
how do i get there again

6590.239 --> 6592.799999999999
much

6593.36 --> 6597.839999999999
yeah

6594.56 --> 6597.84
that's it

6605.52 --> 6609.4800000000005
available megabytes

6610.08 --> 6615.28
10 000

6611.76 --> 6615.280000000001
i mean sorry 10 million

6618.239 --> 6623.119
committed bytes in use

6620.48 --> 6625.678999999999
21 000

6623.119 --> 6629.159
available megabytes

6625.679 --> 6629.159
10 million

6642.88 --> 6647.4400000000005
this is by the way still not the one

6644.48 --> 6649.598999999999
that was actually looking for but

6647.44 --> 6652.598999999999
is it system tools

6649.599 --> 6652.599
no

6655.76 --> 6660.56
i don't know i'm having trouble finding

6657.599 --> 6660.56
the right thing here

6660.719 --> 6667.2390000000005
but yeah it's safe to say i have a huge

6663.199 --> 6667.239
amount of memory in my computer

6673.44 --> 6677.839999999999
ah there's it that's it oh yeah yeah

6676.159 --> 6679.839999999999
yeah

6677.84 --> 6683.599
installed memory

6679.84 --> 6683.599
16 gigabytes

6684.08 --> 6687.88
i think i have enough

6705.04 --> 6712.48
right performance quality of memory

6708.32 --> 6712.48
is a 7.6 score

6714.719 --> 6719.44
according to this

6716.239 --> 6719.44
analysis system

6720.48 --> 6725.678999999999
so yeah no my computer is absolutely

6723.36 --> 6725.679
great

6730.4 --> 6736.239
but anyway i'm rounding out the show

6732.48 --> 6739.36
this has gone on long enough

6736.239 --> 6739.36
it's not my computer

6741.28 --> 6747.119
computer is doing doing just fine

6744.32 --> 6751.48
my monitor is getting kind of old

6747.119 --> 6751.48
but even that still works

6754.639 --> 6758.56
why today's standards well it wasn't low

6757.84 --> 6760.56
by

6758.56 --> 6763.04
standards of 10 years ago logical

6760.56 --> 6768.56
conclusion

6763.04 --> 6772.239
i've never had any issues with memory

6768.56 --> 6775.360000000001
or sloth like anything

6772.239 --> 6780.239
everything i've ever run on my computer

6775.36 --> 6783.199
always goes fluid every single time

6780.239 --> 6783.199
