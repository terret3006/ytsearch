86.96 --> 94.72
not as beautiful as yesterday

91.2 --> 101.84
it's a little bit more cloudy although

94.72 --> 101.84
interesting looking clouds though see

114.24 --> 116.55999999999999
right

118.079 --> 129.119
so here we go again is first in chat

123.28 --> 132.56
good to see you

129.119 --> 132.56
i tear it 306

135.44 --> 143.84
all right so finally starting on time

154.08 --> 157.28
so today i'm feeling a lot calmer than

156.56 --> 161.76
yesterday

157.28 --> 161.76
at least which is a good thing

162.0 --> 165.519
really starting to calm down

167.92 --> 171.44
and yeah i've been thinking about

170.16 --> 173.2
certain things i've been saying

171.44 --> 176.319
yesterday too

173.2 --> 181.92
about my yeah

176.319 --> 184.39999999999998
declaration like cremation a care

181.92 --> 186.879
now it was kind of like winging it with

184.4 --> 190.239
that one

186.879 --> 192.39999999999998
but yeah in essence i i

190.239 --> 196.4
i hope people got that like i'm not

192.4 --> 196.4
going to engage in some kind of like

196.84 --> 200.56
conscious sacrificing or suppressing

199.92 --> 203.51899999999998
ritual

200.56 --> 203.519
it's just that

205.12 --> 211.44
uh like the knee like

208.319 --> 211.44
the empathy is

211.84 --> 215.04
making me kind of hopeless in this sort

214.08 --> 217.36
of scenario

215.04 --> 218.879
and i just need to step away and so i

217.36 --> 221.28
need to care a little less

218.879 --> 223.04
in the moment at least like retract my

221.28 --> 226.239
care it's not even that

223.04 --> 228.48
i don't care it's just that i

226.239 --> 231.44
i don't know you could compare it maybe

228.48 --> 232.959
more to a situation

231.44 --> 235.12
where you'd have a kid and they're at

232.959 --> 235.599
that age where they're gonna do it their

235.12 --> 237.36
way

235.599 --> 238.959
and there's nothing really you can do to

237.36 --> 241.84
stop it

238.959 --> 243.92000000000002
and even though you know or yeah the

241.84 --> 247.20000000000002
suffering they will typically

243.92 --> 248.07999999999998
undergo because of it you gotta like let

247.2 --> 251.28
them do it

248.08 --> 254.56
and so you gotta retract

251.28 --> 258.089
and just let them do it and i think

254.56 --> 259.919
if that sort of thing is more the

258.089 --> 263.04
[Music]

259.919 --> 265.919
that sort of thing is more like the

263.04 --> 269.759
the creation of care i was aiming at but

265.919 --> 272.96
i guess that just calling it that

269.759 --> 274.96000000000004
some crap attention grabby or something

272.96 --> 276.4
i don't know what i was exactly thinking

274.96 --> 279.03999999999996
in a moment i just thought that was

276.4 --> 279.03999999999996
appropriate

279.28 --> 283.84
wasn't really i think

283.919 --> 290.4
but then again every time i think of

287.28 --> 294.32
something supposed evil ones are doing

290.4 --> 297.35999999999996
and suppose it rituals i just think

294.32 --> 301.52
about it like this like the

297.36 --> 305.12
the evil people the willing evil

301.52 --> 308.479
they steal all these rituals they steal

305.12 --> 311.44
all these things these are called

308.479 --> 312.24
things that are ancient traditions they

311.44 --> 316.4
stole it

312.24 --> 318.16
and they made it evil and everybody

316.4 --> 320.32
doesn't know about it and then they get

318.16 --> 322.16
confronted with something like bohemian

320.32 --> 323.44
grove and the rituals they do there and

322.16 --> 325.759
so they just think

323.44 --> 327.52
it's per default evil because it's kept

325.759 --> 330.56
secret so it must be evil

327.52 --> 335.039
well what if it wasn't really

330.56 --> 335.039
evil originally and they just made it

336.84 --> 341.44
evil

338.08 --> 344.96
so i'm in my own weird way kind of like

341.44 --> 346.08
fishing their tricks and then just

344.96 --> 349.19899999999996
saying no

346.08 --> 352.32
i'm not going along with their plan

349.199 --> 356.08000000000004
and i'm claiming it back

352.32 --> 356.08
i'm claiming back the magic

361.84 --> 365.44
like every time it's something oh we're

364.08 --> 367.919
doing this oh we're so

365.44 --> 368.639
special we are evil we're in control

367.919 --> 372.79999999999995
it's like no

368.639 --> 372.8
no you just stole that effect

373.28 --> 377.44
and you're polluting it by associating

375.68 --> 380.479
with it

377.44 --> 382.8
and you're discouraging others from

380.479 --> 384.31899999999996
perceiving it as something that might

382.8 --> 387.199
actually be

384.319 --> 388.08000000000004
positive in some way like the things

387.199 --> 391.36
that they do

388.08 --> 393.59999999999997
could be used like that but because

391.36 --> 394.72
they are dark and they are doing what

393.6 --> 398.16
they do they

394.72 --> 400.72
use it to discourage others to just

398.16 --> 402.24
associate everything that they use with

400.72 --> 404.639
evil

402.24 --> 405.6
when it's just tools to them and they

404.639 --> 409.36
want

405.6 --> 412.639
others to not want to use things

409.36 --> 413.039
because yeah that empowers them and they

412.639 --> 417.44
fear

413.039 --> 417.44
that they fear others to be empowered

417.919 --> 423.039
so they convince everyone that

421.199 --> 424.88
those things that could potentially

423.039 --> 428.4
empower ban them

424.88 --> 428.71999999999997
are evil and you can only attain that if

428.4 --> 431.599
you're

428.72 --> 431.59900000000005
part of them

432.08 --> 436.0
and that's kind of like a little thing

434.0 --> 439.84
that i've been doing for a while now

436.0 --> 443.12
and you could say like even with the 33

439.84 --> 445.19899999999996
that i've done that first i just claimed

443.12 --> 447.68
it back just say no

445.199 --> 449.639
yeah i know the 33 is all associated

447.68 --> 452.8
with

449.639 --> 455.68
freemasonry and numerology

452.8 --> 457.52000000000004
and all the symbolism and i just think

455.68 --> 460.56
it's a strong number

457.52 --> 464.24
and they just stole it

460.56 --> 468.0
or they claimed it made it their thing

464.24 --> 470.08
and then they slowly or

468.0 --> 472.4
quickly i don't know exactly how but

470.08 --> 474.71999999999997
they corrupted and therefore the number

472.4 --> 476.08
becomes associated with their corruption

474.72 --> 478.24
you see

476.08 --> 479.199
and i'm just taking it back just saying

478.24 --> 492.8
no

479.199 --> 498.0
no maybe it's just a power number uh

492.8 --> 501.52000000000004
hello terminoid what right so

498.0 --> 503.52
just to clarify that

501.52 --> 506.0
what i just explained is typically the

503.52 --> 510.479
reason why i do this sort of things i'm

506.0 --> 513.039
not trying to sneak in evil occultism

510.479 --> 514.159
and making everybody used to just

513.039 --> 518.8
accepting it no

514.159 --> 521.8389999999999
i'm trying to take it back

518.8 --> 521.8389999999999
trying to take it back

523.44 --> 530.1600000000001
for everybody for the good willing

527.04 --> 532.8
to not be afraid of these things and

530.16 --> 532.8
what they are

532.959 --> 537.4399999999999
and not the the groups and the people

535.839 --> 541.36
using them

537.44 --> 544.48
you don't become them by using it

541.36 --> 546.08
you only become them by using it their

544.48 --> 550.08
way

546.08 --> 550.08
with their angle to things

554.16 --> 557.36
magical rituals

557.68 --> 560.7199999999999
right well if you don't understand yeah

559.44 --> 564.8800000000001
then it is just

560.72 --> 564.88
mysterious and creepy and you don't know

567.76 --> 575.2
and i'm not drawing you in

571.04 --> 578.0
in some kind of magic ritual i'm

575.2 --> 580.72
dispelling the magic ritual i'm

578.0 --> 584.0
dispelling

580.72 --> 586.24
the the nonsense that's what i'm trying

584.0 --> 590.8
to do anyway i'm trying to defuse it

586.24 --> 593.92
just telling you no

590.8 --> 597.12
it's not about the exoterics

593.92 --> 598.64
it's about that they do something

597.12 --> 601.839
mysterious

598.64 --> 602.8389999999999
and then show and use these symbols and

601.839 --> 607.2
these

602.839 --> 610.0
effects so that you look at those

607.2 --> 611.12
things and effects and start to become

610.0 --> 614.079
suspicious of

611.12 --> 616.079
them those things and effects those

614.079 --> 619.519
exoterics

616.079 --> 622.64
so that you will never

619.519 --> 624.32
really use that never look into it

622.64 --> 626.16
consider that hey maybe that is

624.32 --> 627.519
something you can do doesn't necessarily

626.16 --> 629.519
make you evil

627.519 --> 631.519
it's only when you do that the thing

629.519 --> 636.24
that they do

631.519 --> 636.24
with it you see

645.04 --> 651.12
yeah 777 hey nathan oakley 980

655.04 --> 658.88
it's kind of funny how like the timing

658.16 --> 661.519
with that is

658.88 --> 663.279
that for me to just start out with this

661.519 --> 667.2
subject

663.279 --> 669.92
at this show but it is appropriate

667.2 --> 671.2
it's like all these things these numbers

669.92 --> 674.3199999999999
these effects these

671.2 --> 678.1600000000001
archaic symbols

674.32 --> 678.1600000000001
they all started somewhere

678.24 --> 684.32
and you something universal

681.279 --> 686.72
that i've started to recognize

684.32 --> 688.0
it's and it is really universal and i

686.72 --> 690.5600000000001
think i'm right about this

688.0 --> 692.24
and that is that all the symbols every

690.56 --> 695.1199999999999
single one of them

692.24 --> 695.12
they were never

695.36 --> 699.76
most of them that are the oldest at

697.68 --> 703.8389999999999
least they cannot have been

699.76 --> 703.8389999999999
created out of evil

704.959 --> 713.3599999999999
they were always a start out to

709.36 --> 716.8000000000001
a thing to enhance consciousness to

713.36 --> 720.88
realize something about reality

716.8 --> 724.16
and then to reduce that understanding

720.88 --> 727.76
into a symbol into a thing that could

724.16 --> 730.0
echo on in the ages and be recognized

727.76 --> 731.92
like the nazi symbol indeed well i'm not

730.0 --> 734.88
going to

731.92 --> 736.0
reassimilate that one anytime soon even

734.88 --> 740.0
though

736.0 --> 743.92
i would like to i would like that

740.0 --> 744.959
that just the the evil associated that

743.92 --> 749.92
it would be

744.959 --> 753.76
dispelled and in ways

749.92 --> 756.959
like uh countries in the east

753.76 --> 759.92
like really the east like asia

756.959 --> 761.04
they don't look at that symbol in the

759.92 --> 765.36
same way

761.04 --> 768.24
and swastikas are even still utilized in

765.36 --> 769.92
hindu religion if i'm correct i'm not

768.24 --> 771.76
too sure

769.92 --> 773.68
this is a rough estimation heaven

771.76 --> 776.0
actually went out in the field to look

773.68 --> 778.4799999999999
around and see how much of it

776.0 --> 780.639
is still there i just heard it's still

778.48 --> 784.399
being used

780.639 --> 784.399
right and i wish

784.839 --> 790.72
that it could just be

787.88 --> 791.68
reassimilated like as the symbol that it

790.72 --> 794.5600000000001
really stands for

791.68 --> 796.3199999999999
and not of what hitler and the nazis

794.56 --> 801.8389999999999
wanted to do

796.32 --> 801.839
what they made it into

802.32 --> 807.2
reclaim the symbols for free humanity

807.839 --> 819.2790000000001
isn't it flipped over though

814.56 --> 819.279
uh yeah maybe

820.639 --> 827.279
but people don't really even

824.399 --> 828.0
see that though you know when they see

827.279 --> 830.399
it they don't

828.0 --> 831.36
see they don't look at it with which way

830.399 --> 834.72
it's turning

831.36 --> 834.72
if it just looks like that

834.959 --> 838.0
the original way of or the mirror they

837.279 --> 842.32
just see

838.0 --> 843.04
it they don't know there's even a

842.32 --> 846.1600000000001
difference

843.04 --> 848.3199999999999
most people they just see it and they

846.16 --> 850.639
think ah nazi symbol even though it

848.32 --> 857.839
might not be the

850.639 --> 857.839
it might not be turned around

866.88 --> 872.56
coriolis proof one

870.16 --> 872.56
anyway

874.72 --> 879.279
i was just thinking like cremation of

877.839 --> 885.839
care and like

879.279 --> 885.8389999999999
the people engaging in that that

886.24 --> 890.24
what what is all that what's actually

888.079 --> 891.4399999999999
happening because i think that these

890.24 --> 893.6800000000001
people

891.44 --> 896.0
that engage in this sort of ritual the

893.68 --> 899.92
cremation of care

896.0 --> 904.16
that they are in actuality desperate

899.92 --> 906.0
to really not care because

904.16 --> 908.3199999999999
even though they might have psychopathic

906.0 --> 909.279
traits or whatever or they doubled down

908.32 --> 912.0790000000001
on the business

909.279 --> 913.4399999999999
guild or [ __ ] got involved with the

912.079 --> 915.68
creepiness

913.44 --> 917.36
they probably still have some kind of

915.68 --> 920.6389999999999
human feelings

917.36 --> 922.72
and to be in the middle of

920.639 --> 925.36
all this darkness unfolding is

922.72 --> 930.0
disconcerting either way

925.36 --> 930.0
the the cremation of care is almost like

930.32 --> 936.32
it's not like a celebration of

932.959 --> 939.5189999999999
psychopathy it is really

936.32 --> 943.519
used to be i think a thing a ritual

939.519 --> 946.8
to lay down the troubles

943.519 --> 948.9590000000001
you experience from what you're engaging

946.8 --> 948.959
in

949.12 --> 954.0
but more from a responsibility

951.92 --> 956.88
perspective like you have to

954.0 --> 959.36
retract some of your care and able to be

956.88 --> 962.639
properly managing things without

959.36 --> 964.24
anguish because then you lose that grip

962.639 --> 966.399
you see

964.24 --> 968.0
have you ever thought of it like that i

966.399 --> 970.639
do that sort of thinking about

968.0 --> 972.88
things all the time it's like oh some

970.639 --> 975.199
dark [ __ ] is being presented and then

972.88 --> 976.72
everybody i know everybody's immediately

975.199 --> 979.4399999999999
squirting all over it

976.72 --> 980.9590000000001
and i'm just looking like what is it

979.44 --> 984.0790000000001
they're actually doing

980.959 --> 986.16
do they know what they're actually doing

984.079 --> 989.519
the ones actually doing the ritual

986.16 --> 993.04
and what and if not what do they

989.519 --> 993.04
think they're actually doing

994.079 --> 999.8389999999999
because every time somebody does some

996.0 --> 1002.399
kind of dark ritual or anything

999.839 --> 1003.12
everybody that gets to learn about that

1002.399 --> 1006.16
always

1003.12 --> 1009.68
assume that those people know

1006.16 --> 1011.92
exactly what they're doing

1009.68 --> 1013.7589999999999
right that they know the full scope of

1011.92 --> 1017.4399999999999
it all that they understand that

1013.759 --> 1020.8000000000001
do they do they really

1017.44 --> 1020.8000000000001
somehow i doubt it

1021.04 --> 1025.199
but maybe that's just me maybe they do

1024.48 --> 1028.079
understand

1025.199 --> 1028.48
maybe they understand it even beyond the

1028.079 --> 1030.6399999999999
way

1028.48 --> 1033.039
that i'm looking at or maybe they caught

1030.64 --> 1036.0790000000002
got caught up in a

1033.039 --> 1036.48
false way of looking things that's like

1036.079 --> 1040.24
a

1036.48 --> 1040.24
little personal mini culture

1040.319 --> 1044.959
that yeah you get that gets revealed to

1043.76 --> 1048.079
you through others

1044.959 --> 1052.559
it's like this is how we do it

1048.079 --> 1054.6399999999999
and then from that cultural perspective

1052.559 --> 1057.039
you think you know what you're doing

1054.64 --> 1058.96
with those rituals and things because

1057.039 --> 1059.679
there is an explanation from that

1058.96 --> 1062.0
perspective

1059.679 --> 1063.2800000000002
doesn't mean it has to be actually true

1062.0 --> 1068.72
it could be their own

1063.28 --> 1070.8799999999999
little conspiracy idea of how things are

1068.72 --> 1072.32
and because they all keep it secret

1070.88 --> 1075.679
mostly

1072.32 --> 1078.3999999999999
you don't really get to find out whether

1075.679 --> 1081.679
they truly know it

1078.4 --> 1086.0800000000002
or whether they just have a cultural

1081.679 --> 1086.0800000000002
deluded view of what they're doing

1087.12 --> 1090.559
it's something to think about not too

1089.76 --> 1093.039
hard though

1090.559 --> 1095.84
not too long can be quite confusing i

1093.039 --> 1095.84
think

1098.16 --> 1105.039
right so let's let's get back into chat

1102.08 --> 1105.36
i think i made my point quite clear oh

1105.039 --> 1107.44
yeah

1105.36 --> 1109.4399999999998
also been watching some owen benjamin

1107.44 --> 1112.24
he's still streaming

1109.44 --> 1112.72
but not live anymore he's just uploading

1112.24 --> 1116.08
things

1112.72 --> 1118.16
and watching an unbeat shoot it's very

1116.08 --> 1120.24
enlightening like

1118.16 --> 1122.16
it's almost like the chat distractions

1120.24 --> 1123.84
have gone away a little and he's even

1122.16 --> 1125.919
talked about that today

1123.84 --> 1127.84
or yesterday on the stream yesterday

1125.919 --> 1129.8400000000001
that i watched a little piece off right

1127.84 --> 1131.84
before the show

1129.84 --> 1133.36
and he just seems much more focused on

1131.84 --> 1135.28
the message

1133.36 --> 1136.8799999999999
and just rolling out complete not

1135.28 --> 1139.6789999999999
getting distracted

1136.88 --> 1140.96
and i'm almost kind of jealous it makes

1139.679 --> 1143.919
me it reminds me

1140.96 --> 1145.919
of my flatter talk days when i didn't

1143.919 --> 1147.76
really have that life interaction as

1145.919 --> 1149.919
much

1147.76 --> 1151.44
not because it wasn't live it was it's

1149.919 --> 1154.4
just there were so

1151.44 --> 1155.3600000000001
few people in chat and they were mostly

1154.4 --> 1158.5590000000002
just listening

1155.36 --> 1159.12
or trolling i wasn't really engaging as

1158.559 --> 1161.28
much

1159.12 --> 1163.52
with them as i was right now so i was

1161.28 --> 1167.76
just really focused on the subject

1163.52 --> 1167.76
primarily and that does help

1168.16 --> 1173.1200000000001
it helps for the quality of what you're

1170.0 --> 1173.12
of the message you're bringing

1174.72 --> 1178.08
then again you would have to have some

1177.28 --> 1180.24
kind of message

1178.08 --> 1182.799
you want to be related you want to be

1180.24 --> 1182.799
relating

1184.48 --> 1188.72
and yeah i don't always have that

1186.4 --> 1191.6000000000001
sometimes it's just me

1188.72 --> 1192.0
waking up feeling in a certain way not

1191.6 --> 1194.08
really

1192.0 --> 1196.48
knowing what to do with it and then the

1194.08 --> 1199.28
show kind of turns into just like me

1196.48 --> 1200.24
trying to express what i'm feeling and

1199.28 --> 1203.6
then

1200.24 --> 1205.44
ideas that come with that

1203.6 --> 1206.6399999999999
and it's just more like a showcase like

1205.44 --> 1208.799
i'm just

1206.64 --> 1210.0800000000002
showing my natural response to things

1208.799 --> 1214.24
and

1210.08 --> 1214.24
but that's not really subject oriented

1214.48 --> 1221.84
so those types of shows typically just

1218.4 --> 1226.24
i interact with the chat and then

1221.84 --> 1229.039
yeah there's this chemistry between us

1226.24 --> 1230.0
you give your insights and your opinions

1229.039 --> 1232.72
and i

1230.0 --> 1235.84
like look at it and just think like okay

1232.72 --> 1235.84
how am i going to

1235.919 --> 1243.3600000000001
move like emotionally and spiritually

1240.0 --> 1244.159
how am i going to move in reflection of

1243.36 --> 1247.039
what i've seen

1244.159 --> 1248.159
because it does help if people reflect

1247.039 --> 1250.08
upon these things

1248.159 --> 1252.159
then i get to watch it from their

1250.08 --> 1255.52
perspective what they attain from it

1252.159 --> 1257.679
because while i'm in it there's always

1255.52 --> 1259.12
every time things that are concealed for

1257.679 --> 1263.679
me like i can't

1259.12 --> 1266.559
see how other people see it and me

1263.679 --> 1269.76
and it's thus very helpful that i have a

1266.559 --> 1269.76
chat to interact with

1270.96 --> 1275.679
that helped me with that with help help

1273.52 --> 1279.28
me clarify

1275.679 --> 1281.52
the situation and what i'm doing

1279.28 --> 1284.8799999999999
it's really helpful but it's a whole

1281.52 --> 1287.36
other way of doing a hangout

1284.88 --> 1289.1200000000001
and i've been doing this a lot recently

1287.36 --> 1290.3999999999999
because yeah at some point

1289.12 --> 1292.3999999999999
you're kind of going to run out of

1290.4 --> 1292.96
subjects and the only way you're going

1292.4 --> 1296.64
to stay

1292.96 --> 1298.4
a subject orientated is by constantly

1296.64 --> 1301.3600000000001
going out and finding

1298.4 --> 1303.3600000000001
a subject to talk about well i tried

1301.36 --> 1305.28
that earlier in the early bird series

1303.36 --> 1308.799
like the first year

1305.28 --> 1311.84
and it became very hard

1308.799 --> 1313.799
after like after a while very tough

1311.84 --> 1315.84
to keep hanging on to just

1313.799 --> 1317.84
subject-oriented

1315.84 --> 1320.32
so that's why i did this it's just like

1317.84 --> 1323.1999999999998
no it's just an open chat

1320.32 --> 1323.76
can be whatever whatever people bring to

1323.2 --> 1326.48
the chat

1323.76 --> 1328.0
whatever i bring whatever connects and

1326.48 --> 1329.84
sometimes it's just

1328.0 --> 1332.08
a bit of goofing around and then me

1329.84 --> 1333.76
getting pissed off at my chat like why

1332.08 --> 1336.799
aren't you more serious

1333.76 --> 1338.48
why are you goofing around this is and

1336.799 --> 1340.96
that's that that's just gonna be what

1338.48 --> 1340.96
that is

1341.039 --> 1344.799
but anyway

1345.039 --> 1348.96
hello unbelievable productions good to

1347.039 --> 1350.1589999999999
see you there's a lot of people in chat

1348.96 --> 1355.3600000000001
by the way tommenoid

1350.159 --> 1355.3600000000001
matthew mitchells dutch sailor

1359.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
rob h

1363.84 --> 1370.0
right also i don't know if he's gonna

1367.6 --> 1372.08
object to it but i've been having more

1370.0 --> 1372.96
back-and-forth emails with good servant

1372.08 --> 1376.6399999999999
to clarify

1372.96 --> 1377.44
things and he's just doing his own show

1376.64 --> 1380.48
i think

1377.44 --> 1383.679
doing pretty good like

1380.48 --> 1385.919
he seems to have i'm not sure what

1383.679 --> 1386.72
exactly he's done but i think that he

1385.919 --> 1388.64
might have just

1386.72 --> 1390.799
stepped away from flat earth and focused

1388.64 --> 1393.1200000000001
purely on christianity not to mention

1390.799 --> 1395.52
anything about those things

1393.12 --> 1397.039
and certainly i don't even i'm guessing

1395.52 --> 1399.84
now he hasn't told me

1397.039 --> 1402.0
he hasn't told me that he expl

1399.84 --> 1403.6
explicitly excluded flat earth or

1402.0 --> 1405.6
anything but he has a new channel

1403.6 --> 1408.24
apparently and he has like over

1405.6 --> 1409.1999999999998
1200 subscribers already already pretty

1408.24 --> 1412.159
quickly

1409.2 --> 1412.64
so he's doing well and i'm happy for him

1412.159 --> 1415.0390000000002
i

1412.64 --> 1417.2800000000002
genuinely am because he wanted the

1415.039 --> 1419.12
platform he wanted a show he wanted an

1417.28 --> 1423.36
audience he wanted to do his thing

1419.12 --> 1426.559
and it seems like he's getting it and

1423.36 --> 1429.6789999999999
that's good i'm happy for him

1426.559 --> 1430.0
i'm very happy for him i don't think i'm

1429.679 --> 1433.52
really

1430.0 --> 1437.039
going to be friends with him like as

1433.52 --> 1440.72
before but at least i know

1437.039 --> 1442.64
he's he's out of that rut and he's got

1440.72 --> 1444.4
something to work on

1442.64 --> 1446.64
and he wants that and he needs that so

1444.4 --> 1448.64
i'm happy for him and glad that he can

1446.64 --> 1451.8400000000001
move on

1448.64 --> 1452.4
and now he still seems to donate to my

1451.84 --> 1455.039
channel

1452.4 --> 1459.8400000000001
and or yeah to me through paypal and i

1455.039 --> 1459.84
do also appreciate that

1460.32 --> 1464.08
even though he's not really part of the

1462.0 --> 1466.24
show anymore or in the chat

1464.08 --> 1467.6789999999999
but i do appreciate it so yeah good

1466.24 --> 1470.64
servant

1467.679 --> 1472.0800000000002
i wish you the best of luck with your

1470.64 --> 1474.5590000000002
new youtube channel and your

1472.08 --> 1475.4399999999998
exploits and i hope you do well and you

1474.559 --> 1478.08
find peace

1475.44 --> 1480.24
the peace that you're looking for

1478.08 --> 1483.36
through christ

1480.24 --> 1487.84
as always anyway so that

1483.36 --> 1487.84
was there

1493.679 --> 1496.3200000000002
what is this

1498.0 --> 1504.48
the caves of chauvet paintings

1501.6 --> 1504.48
if there are hoax

1504.72 --> 1511.84
i wouldn't know they might be

1509.36 --> 1514.3999999999999
or maybe at some point there were some

1511.84 --> 1517.9189999999999
artists that were like

1514.4 --> 1520.72
this stupid society i'm sick of it

1517.919 --> 1522.64
it's not allowed for some reason that i

1520.72 --> 1524.559
just paint like this [ __ ] so i'm just

1522.64 --> 1525.6000000000001
gonna go into this cave and and do it

1524.559 --> 1527.9189999999999
like that

1525.6 --> 1530.32
maybe it was just like a tartarian art

1527.919 --> 1530.3200000000002
project

1537.12 --> 1544.4799999999998
is was it made by ancient cave

1540.84 --> 1547.12
people i doubt it

1544.48 --> 1549.44
but does it mean that it has to be

1547.12 --> 1557.6
modern faked

1549.44 --> 1560.0800000000002
but i don't know it might be it might be

1557.6 --> 1561.76
but it could also be just not what they

1560.08 --> 1563.279
say it is but it might have been an

1561.76 --> 1566.0
original art project

1563.279 --> 1566.96
in whatever period maybe yeah a

1566.0 --> 1568.559
tartarian

1566.96 --> 1571.3600000000001
just went into a cave and thought like

1568.559 --> 1573.6
yeah i'm gonna do this

1571.36 --> 1575.039
because society doesn't appreciate me so

1573.6 --> 1585.84
i'm just gonna do it here i'm just gonna

1575.039 --> 1585.84
do my art here who knows

1602.08 --> 1606.72
humans have been faking things ever

1604.64 --> 1610.48
since they realized they could

1606.72 --> 1610.48
well that's when the priesthood started

1610.84 --> 1616.6399999999999
yeah

1612.0 --> 1619.76
but that's pretty much very long ago

1616.64 --> 1622.7990000000002
i think it arrived that sort of trickery

1619.76 --> 1626.08
when first the first humans

1622.799 --> 1629.039
experienced prosperity it's in the

1626.08 --> 1630.6399999999999
times of plenty where certain people

1629.039 --> 1631.84
just start to figure out weight there's

1630.64 --> 1634.24
so much

1631.84 --> 1635.9189999999999
i can just trick people into giving me

1634.24 --> 1638.96
stuff

1635.919 --> 1641.2
i think that's when it started

1638.96 --> 1643.279
because when when yeah there is no

1641.2 --> 1645.3600000000001
prosperity whatsoever and everybody has

1643.279 --> 1647.039
to fight for their food

1645.36 --> 1648.7199999999998
people are not going to be tricked and

1647.039 --> 1651.36
if they are they're going to

1648.72 --> 1653.44
be very vengeful because something that

1651.36 --> 1655.4399999999998
they needed very much was taken from

1653.44 --> 1657.76
them they needed it to survive

1655.44 --> 1660.559
so it's only in times of prosperity that

1657.76 --> 1664.1589999999999
i think that people

1660.559 --> 1664.1589999999999
really start to fake things

1665.279 --> 1669.279
because they can and they can get away

1667.52 --> 1671.2
with it much easier even if it was

1669.279 --> 1673.52
discovered then it's just like oh

1671.2 --> 1674.799
we've been tricked oh well let's move on

1673.52 --> 1675.6
because they can because there's

1674.799 --> 1679.039
prosperity

1675.6 --> 1679.039
and no big deal like that

1680.84 --> 1683.84
right

1701.36 --> 1705.36
right off the bat they claimed 36 000

1704.64 --> 1708.5590000000002
years old

1705.36 --> 1711.4399999999998
and how did they do that

1708.559 --> 1712.1589999999999
did they take sample of the carbon used

1711.44 --> 1714.559
in the

1712.159 --> 1715.6000000000001
in the drawing and then concluded this

1714.559 --> 1719.279
is 30

1715.6 --> 1722.0
000 this is 36 year 36

1719.279 --> 1722.64
000 year old carbon carbon dated or

1722.0 --> 1725.84
whatever

1722.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
did they do that

1726.08 --> 1730.08
i yeah i don't know where they'd get it

1728.48 --> 1732.08
it sounds like it's just a stupid

1730.08 --> 1734.399
estimation game they just

1732.08 --> 1736.08
take this fast scale of time and it just

1734.399 --> 1738.399
size up like oh this

1736.08 --> 1739.12
according to what has generally been

1738.399 --> 1741.9189999999999
envisioned

1739.12 --> 1742.799
should be there well because it looks

1741.919 --> 1745.279
like this

1742.799 --> 1746.32
it's in a location like this then it

1745.279 --> 1749.84
must just be

1746.32 --> 1750.96
roughly this age i think they do it like

1749.84 --> 1754.0
that

1750.96 --> 1758.799
it's just guesstimation according to

1754.0 --> 1758.799
their system of how things should work

1759.279 --> 1763.6
some carbon dating is slow yeah sure it

1761.039 --> 1766.72
is i'm not saying it isn't i'm just

1763.6 --> 1771.12
asking like did they do that um

1766.72 --> 1772.48
on the cave painting paint

1771.12 --> 1774.8799999999999
and i'm pretty sure there's carbon in

1772.48 --> 1774.88
there too

1775.039 --> 1778.24
it was just a question but it could be

1777.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
that

1778.24 --> 1781.84
they didn't even do that at all

1786.08 --> 1794.509
[Music]

1806.399 --> 1811.279
radiocarbon dating yep right

1817.84 --> 1823.84
rhinos in france and leopards

1826.64 --> 1831.3600000000001
well maybe they were

1834.64 --> 1838.96
i think there were all kinds of wild

1836.88 --> 1842.0800000000002
bigger predators

1838.96 --> 1845.76
in ancient in like

1842.08 --> 1849.039
in old europe before it got all grappled

1845.76 --> 1851.679
and certified and acidified

1849.039 --> 1852.24
with cities and everything before there

1851.679 --> 1854.159
there was

1852.24 --> 1856.3990000000001
just a whole lot of woods and i think

1854.159 --> 1859.2
there was a whole range of

1856.399 --> 1865.84
bigger predators that are now just

1859.2 --> 1865.8400000000001
blatantly extinct

1884.08 --> 1886.96
right anyway

1888.44 --> 1896.0800000000002
gravitation in auric neon

1891.6 --> 1896.08
pier what the [ __ ] is that

1899.76 --> 1907.84
how hot was it in these periods

1908.399 --> 1912.4799999999998
well realize also by the way that the

1911.12 --> 1914.799
medieval time

1912.48 --> 1916.08
officially and that's not even too

1914.799 --> 1919.44
incredibly long ago

1916.08 --> 1921.6789999999999
it was very hot even in europe

1919.44 --> 1922.799
remember that like officially according

1921.679 --> 1926.48
to the history

1922.799 --> 1931.44
there was a miniature ice age during the

1926.48 --> 1934.559
renaissance the 70s somethings

1931.44 --> 1937.76
but before in the medieval period

1934.559 --> 1939.44
it was very warm it was an exceptionally

1937.76 --> 1943.12
warm

1939.44 --> 1943.1200000000001
like in europe everywhere

1946.799 --> 1951.76
so for example i can imagine that in the

1950.08 --> 1953.279
old netherlands before it became the

1951.76 --> 1956.399
netherlands when it was all just

1953.279 --> 1958.24
swamps and [ __ ] god can you imagine like

1956.399 --> 1961.5189999999998
there was a giant heat

1958.24 --> 1963.6
always must have been mosquito hell over

1961.519 --> 1966.72
here in the netherlands

1963.6 --> 1970.399
before it became the netherlands the

1966.72 --> 1974.799
the deets regions

1970.399 --> 1976.2399999999998
the swamp people as it started out

1974.799 --> 1978.24
it was really that hot there must have

1976.24 --> 1982.159
been a whole bunch of mosquitoes

1978.24 --> 1982.159
constantly everywhere must be very

1988.84 --> 1991.84
annoying

1991.919 --> 1999.44
that's when they say the caves were used

1995.519 --> 2001.679
what well then maybe in that case

1999.44 --> 2003.44
those caves were painted during medieval

2001.679 --> 2005.6000000000001
times

2003.44 --> 2007.2
it's kind of funny that way because if

2005.6 --> 2010.6399999999999
they're supposed to be like

2007.2 --> 2014.559
in inquisitor [ __ ] going on

2010.64 --> 2016.72
and it was then

2014.559 --> 2017.6
well maybe an artist actually went to

2016.72 --> 2020.159
the cave

2017.6 --> 2022.08
because he didn't want to get arrested

2020.159 --> 2024.48
for witchcraft

2022.08 --> 2025.6
because his painting he just had this

2024.48 --> 2028.799
expressive thing

2025.6 --> 2031.12
going and he went to the caves

2028.799 --> 2033.039
just to do his art so he wouldn't get

2031.12 --> 2034.9599999999998
persecuted because he knew like if he's

2033.039 --> 2037.44
gonna actually paint that he's gonna

2034.96 --> 2038.96
get arrested by the inquisitors who

2037.44 --> 2041.919
knows

2038.96 --> 2044.159
that's not too unlikely in my opinion

2041.919 --> 2044.159
even

2045.279 --> 2047.84
right

2054.8 --> 2060.159
right but anyway i'm all still yeah

2058.0 --> 2060.8
going at this concept at the cave

2060.159 --> 2062.8
paintings

2060.8 --> 2064.48
from the presupposition that it wasn't

2062.8 --> 2067.76
just a a complete

2064.48 --> 2069.599
rig fake out that there was some

2067.76 --> 2071.3590000000004
original painting going on just trying

2069.599 --> 2072.639
to figure out like what would that have

2071.359 --> 2075.679
been

2072.639 --> 2078.56
if it was actually real

2075.679 --> 2079.28
and not going by their historical

2078.56 --> 2088.32
standard

2079.28 --> 2091.44
nonsense approach

2088.32 --> 2092.0
i know that george sanford i was talking

2091.44 --> 2093.76
about

2092.0 --> 2095.52
the netherlands before it was the

2093.76 --> 2096.079
netherlands it was just a giant swamp

2095.52 --> 2099.44
area

2096.079 --> 2100.8
river mound swamp area well if there was

2099.44 --> 2103.04
a big heat

2100.8 --> 2104.6400000000003
a lot of persistent heat going on in

2103.04 --> 2106.72
europe during that time

2104.64 --> 2108.8799999999997
well then the netherlands before

2106.72 --> 2110.64
beginning ends must have been mosquito

2108.88 --> 2111.6800000000003
hell during that period during the

2110.64 --> 2115.359
entire period

2111.68 --> 2120.3199999999997
there's constant heat and water

2115.359 --> 2120.3199999999997
and yeah swamp mosquitoes everywhere

2122.32 --> 2125.28
i can imagine

2129.2 --> 2132.48
and then yeah if you look at it from

2131.2 --> 2136.16
that perspective

2132.48 --> 2136.64
no wonder the dutch people decided to

2136.16 --> 2139.2799999999997
just

2136.64 --> 2141.1189999999997
dry it all out to drain the swamp and

2139.28 --> 2142.0
turn it into polar and dikes because

2141.119 --> 2144.88
they were like

2142.0 --> 2146.88
yeah let's get that [ __ ] out of here

2144.88 --> 2147.28
before it starts to heat up again and we

2146.88 --> 2149.2000000000003
get

2147.28 --> 2151.599
like overrun by mosquitoes again

2149.2 --> 2155.4399999999996
remember all that remember how

2151.599 --> 2157.92
grand pod died from blood loss

2155.44 --> 2160.2400000000002
from getting bitten to death by miss

2157.92 --> 2162.16
giant mosquitoes

2160.24 --> 2164.3999999999996
let's drain that freaking swamp before

2162.16 --> 2173.839
it heats up again

2164.4 --> 2173.839
i don't know

2175.359 --> 2181.68
yeah i'm just fooling around now

2178.64 --> 2182.16
but seriously though like in when

2181.68 --> 2186.0
there's

2182.16 --> 2189.04
big mosquitoes and it's hot they can get

2186.0 --> 2189.04
very aggressive

2190.8 --> 2196.4
like i remember when i went

2193.92 --> 2197.44
to spain with my parents during the

2196.4 --> 2199.119
summers

2197.44 --> 2200.48
there were some places where there were

2199.119 --> 2204.079
rivers

2200.48 --> 2206.16
like little streams and and all that

2204.079 --> 2208.079
like in the middle of the summer and one

2206.16 --> 2211.7599999999998
time we decided to just

2208.079 --> 2214.88
camp next to a stream like that and then

2211.76 --> 2216.88
like seriously we got attacked by

2214.88 --> 2219.359
mosquitoes it was so bad that we

2216.88 --> 2222.4
literally just moved in the night

2219.359 --> 2224.56
because it was so bad

2222.4 --> 2225.76
like if you just sit still for 10

2224.56 --> 2228.24
minutes and not move

2225.76 --> 2230.079
you would literally have like a thousand

2228.24 --> 2233.839
mosquitoes on you

2230.079 --> 2236.6400000000003
so yeah loss of blood i don't know

2233.839 --> 2236.64
it could happen

2240.839 --> 2243.839
potentially

2244.64 --> 2247.839
yeah especially if the mosquitoes are

2246.4 --> 2249.52
really big you know

2247.839 --> 2251.04
the small ones yeah they're not gonna

2249.52 --> 2251.359
suck up a lot of blood but if they're

2251.04 --> 2255.359
like

2251.359 --> 2257.839
really hornet sized mosquitoes

2255.359 --> 2259.52
yeah and they all attack you at the same

2257.839 --> 2262.16
time you are going to

2259.52 --> 2263.04
get freaking dizzy from blood loss and

2262.16 --> 2266.16
also all

2263.04 --> 2269.04
like yeah the dissolving poison they

2266.16 --> 2273.92
also inject you is gonna [ __ ] you up

2269.04 --> 2276.0
so like the anti-blood clother

2273.92 --> 2278.7200000000003
that they inject every mosquito injects

2276.0 --> 2285.839
in you that's also gonna [ __ ] you up

2278.72 --> 2287.5989999999997
if you have giant amounts of it

2285.839 --> 2289.2799999999997
right here we go again well there you go

2287.599 --> 2299.839
and that's not even

2289.28 --> 2299.8390000000004
right next to a river or anything

2305.75 --> 2309.539
[Music]

2313.359 --> 2317.839
right yeah draining the swamp it's funny

2315.44 --> 2318.8
how that metaphor works out because yes

2317.839 --> 2321.599
swamps

2318.8 --> 2324.48
it's not often talked about they're the

2321.599 --> 2326.2400000000002
breeding hearth of mosquitoes

2324.48 --> 2328.56
that's one of their favorite places to

2326.24 --> 2330.64
do that because it's still water there's

2328.56 --> 2332.59
a lot of stuff going around

2330.64 --> 2334.16
and the mosquito larvae

2332.59 --> 2336.48
[Music]

2334.16 --> 2336.48
i think

2337.359 --> 2341.2799999999997
was that other creatures i'm not sure if

2339.359 --> 2343.2799999999997
mosquito larvae actually

2341.28 --> 2345.3590000000004
hunt as their larvaes did i think there

2343.28 --> 2349.119
was more

2345.359 --> 2349.92
dragonflies that do that but anyway yeah

2349.119 --> 2353.119
swamps

2349.92 --> 2354.0
love i mean mosquitoes love swamps so

2353.119 --> 2357.28
yeah

2354.0 --> 2358.64
if you want to get rid of the mosquito

2357.28 --> 2361.8390000000004
plague of people just

2358.64 --> 2363.92
sucking on everything

2361.839 --> 2365.359
just draining the life and the spirit

2363.92 --> 2366.2400000000002
from everything yeah you got to drain

2365.359 --> 2368.88
that swamp

2366.24 --> 2371.839
that's right it's a very fitting

2368.88 --> 2371.839
metaphor like that

2372.0 --> 2383.839
or the political swamp political swamps

2376.0 --> 2383.839
create mosquito public they do

2384.72 --> 2391.7599999999998
[Music]

2404.88 --> 2411.119
leaving smashed ones behind well

2407.92 --> 2413.6800000000003
good luck with that they don't have

2411.119 --> 2414.7200000000003
any self-conscious mosquitoes don't have

2413.68 --> 2417.68
self-conscious

2414.72 --> 2418.7999999999997
not really they have tactical conscious

2417.68 --> 2420.96
they have

2418.8 --> 2421.8390000000004
spatial awareness to which they respond

2420.96 --> 2424.88
they they

2421.839 --> 2427.839
don't know

2424.88 --> 2430.0
trust me on this they don't know

2427.839 --> 2439.839
mosquitoes are just

2430.0 --> 2439.839
barely barely sentient in any form

2441.359 --> 2453.839
you like to imagine they do okay well

2444.72 --> 2453.839
if that's what you like

2454.79 --> 2458.389
[Music]

2461.0 --> 2464.099
[Music]

2464.839 --> 2467.839
um

2473.839 --> 2482.56
right so yeah

2477.04 --> 2482.56
mosquitoes the swamp cave paintings

2482.96 --> 2486.079
it's kind of interesting

2487.76 --> 2493.2000000000003
yeah i don't like mosquitoes either but

2491.119 --> 2495.04
i just see it as an environmental

2493.2 --> 2496.0789999999997
nuisance i'm not going to blame this

2495.04 --> 2499.359
species

2496.079 --> 2501.119
also mosquitoes are a very important

2499.359 --> 2503.52
part of

2501.119 --> 2506.4
they're a very important food to a whole

2503.52 --> 2506.4
range of creatures

2506.8 --> 2510.6400000000003
a very effective food so

2512.0 --> 2515.44
you know when i was younger i was like

2514.4 --> 2518.48
eradicate

2515.44 --> 2520.7200000000003
all the mosquitoes well

2518.48 --> 2523.839
if you did that then say goodbye to a

2520.72 --> 2523.839
whole range of species

2524.96 --> 2536.48
like bats and certain types of birds

2530.4 --> 2541.92
that live off them

2536.48 --> 2541.92
and let alone other types of insects

2542.319 --> 2549.04
so mosquitoes are like in ways

2545.839 --> 2552.24
fish off the air

2549.04 --> 2553.92
like little fish swarms in the sea

2552.24 --> 2555.5989999999997
they just produce produce produce and

2553.92 --> 2557.04
then they are like a lot of

2555.599 --> 2559.6800000000003
feeding bottom for a lot of other

2557.04 --> 2562.839
creatures well mosquitoes are like that

2559.68 --> 2564.3999999999996
in the insect world the airborne insect

2562.839 --> 2567.7599999999998
world so

2564.4 --> 2570.8
yeah very annoying i don't like them but

2567.76 --> 2572.48
they're there and yeah they are part of

2570.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
nature's

2572.48 --> 2579.839
food cycle

2584.01 --> 2591.0190000000002
[Music]

2593.92 --> 2599.6800000000003
yeah i know i heard about that aries 106

2597.52 --> 2599.68
but

2601.92 --> 2608.079
it's no use not really

2606.079 --> 2610.1600000000003
if you really want to bring down

2608.079 --> 2613.8390000000004
mosquitoes

2610.16 --> 2618.24
then you gotta breed

2613.839 --> 2622.4
natural mosquito predators a lot of them

2618.24 --> 2625.2
so i'd say okay for example

2622.4 --> 2626.319
breed bats sounds really weird right

2625.2 --> 2629.4399999999996
well they have

2626.319 --> 2631.119
they have bat nests

2629.44 --> 2632.88
like here in the forest in the

2631.119 --> 2636.8
netherlands it's great i see

2632.88 --> 2640.96
the bats are plenty around

2636.8 --> 2640.96
and they eat mosquitoes a lot of them

2641.2 --> 2648.48
like a lot a whole lot of the time

2645.04 --> 2651.2799999999997
like throughout the years they eat a lot

2648.48 --> 2651.28
of mosquitoes

2651.76 --> 2655.0400000000004
so that would be a way or i don't know

2653.839 --> 2656.96
swallows

2655.04 --> 2659.599
like certain types of swallows eat a lot

2656.96 --> 2663.839
of mosquitoes well breed them

2659.599 --> 2666.48
and yeah send them out

2663.839 --> 2668.4
when it's like breeding season or

2666.48 --> 2672.2400000000002
whatever and especially in tropical

2668.4 --> 2673.92
countries that sort of thing happens

2672.24 --> 2676.7999999999997
where just like this

2673.92 --> 2678.96
giant cloud of mosquitoes that's visibly

2676.8 --> 2680.2400000000002
visible at great distances just starts

2678.96 --> 2682.56
to arise

2680.24 --> 2684.8799999999997
i'll send in the swallow send in the

2682.56 --> 2684.88
bats

2684.96 --> 2688.7200000000003
and it's gonna survive anyway and

2686.88 --> 2692.319
besides nature

2688.72 --> 2694.9599999999996
already kind of does it in its own way

2692.319 --> 2696.319
because with those big mosquito clouds

2694.96 --> 2698.319
nature knows that

2696.319 --> 2699.68
all the animals know that and they

2698.319 --> 2705.839
already send

2699.68 --> 2705.839
their yeah their harvesters at it

2711.92 --> 2716.7200000000003
they think they could use them for

2713.599 --> 2716.7200000000003
popular oh god

2730.16 --> 2747.839
well yeah i don't know anything about

2732.64 --> 2747.839
that though

2755.839 --> 2758.96
what do you mean it's an interesting

2757.359 --> 2761.52
idea

2758.96 --> 2763.76
why i don't know population control is

2761.52 --> 2767.119
never really a good idea

2763.76 --> 2767.119
even with animals like

2767.76 --> 2775.8390000000004
it's just trying to tinker with nature

2770.16 --> 2775.839
is that really a good idea

2778.88 --> 2784.2400000000002
yeah well what

2782.079 --> 2786.8
creating more disease rather you think

2784.24 --> 2790.16
that's going to control

2786.8 --> 2790.1600000000003
animal populations

2790.48 --> 2794.72
or is it just gonna wreck a whole lot of

2792.4 --> 2794.7200000000003
things

2799.76 --> 2804.4
oh there are three or six i didn't know

2801.52 --> 2817.839
that palindrome

2804.4 --> 2817.839
i guess so

2828.839 --> 2831.839
hmm

2845.28 --> 2848.2400000000002
zika virus

2848.96 --> 2852.48
i don't think zika virus is real here we

2851.52 --> 2855.2
go again

2852.48 --> 2858.64
i don't think it was real at all all

2855.2 --> 2861.839
that nonsense about shrunken

2858.64 --> 2863.92
heads and all that whatever that was

2861.839 --> 2866.0
that wasn't caused by some freaking

2863.92 --> 2869.599
virus it was caused by

2866.0 --> 2872.079
wells that were poison with this

2869.599 --> 2872.7200000000003
pesticide it was caused by pesticide

2872.079 --> 2875.76
poisoning

2872.72 --> 2879.68
has nothing to do with freaking virus

2875.76 --> 2879.6800000000003
there was a complete ruse a complete

2884.839 --> 2887.839
scam

2914.72 --> 2929.839
all right

2937.35 --> 2940.5
[Music]

2943.68 --> 2949.2799999999997
where would you go if you had a time

2945.52 --> 2949.28
machine i would go

2949.52 --> 2954.8
to where the time machine was made and

2951.92 --> 2957.839
then prevent it from being made

2954.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
let's see what happens

2958.83 --> 2962.219
[Music]

2967.04 --> 2974.769
[Music]

2979.599 --> 2983.839
you would be stuck there no i'd still

2981.92 --> 2985.6800000000003
have the time machine

2983.839 --> 2988.64
it's just that it was never made but i

2985.68 --> 2988.64
still have it though

2994.72 --> 3000.5589999999997
because it's there

2998.559 --> 3001.8390000000004
i brought it with me into that other

3000.559 --> 3005.0400000000004
timeline dimension

3001.839 --> 3006.24
so it's just there oh yeah it never gets

3005.04 --> 3009.7599999999998
made well

3006.24 --> 3012.16
that's no concern to physical reality

3009.76 --> 3026.8
because physical reality doesn't care of

3012.16 --> 3028.64
the origin just if it's there or not

3026.8 --> 3030.48
the time machine police will not be

3028.64 --> 3034.96
pleased with that paradox

3030.48 --> 3034.96
this is uh

3035.119 --> 3039.28
i'm sure they won't but then again they

3037.599 --> 3040.88
will never be able to trace it because

3039.28 --> 3044.559
it was never made

3040.88 --> 3046.48
i just have it so how would they ever

3044.559 --> 3047.599
even know where it came from if it was

3046.48 --> 3051.119
never made

3047.599 --> 3052.88
even though it's still there right

3051.119 --> 3055.839
i guess that would make the time machine

3052.88 --> 3055.839
police pissed off

3061.92 --> 3065.76
as soon as you stop it being made it

3064.0 --> 3068.4
would disappear i think you've been

3065.76 --> 3071.8390000000004
watching too much back to the future

3068.4 --> 3071.839
i don't think that happens at all

3073.04 --> 3079.44
because it would disappear no

3076.16 --> 3081.2799999999997
no i would never have been able to

3079.44 --> 3083.44
make the time travel because it was

3081.28 --> 3086.88
never made

3083.44 --> 3088.7200000000003
so either i just flip back to where i

3086.88 --> 3090.079
originally was introduced to the time

3088.72 --> 3092.24
machine that was never made

3090.079 --> 3093.8390000000004
in order to not be able to engage and

3092.24 --> 3097.7599999999998
then just stay where i

3093.839 --> 3100.4
was or it works differently

3097.76 --> 3103.3590000000004
and then there is just this time machine

3100.4 --> 3103.359
that was never made

3107.04 --> 3113.92
things don't phase out

3110.48 --> 3118.079
when something disrupts the the

3113.92 --> 3121.2000000000003
yeah it's original conception

3118.079 --> 3125.119
because i don't think that time is

3121.2 --> 3127.2799999999997
connected like that from a time

3125.119 --> 3130.079
travel perspective which is technically

3127.28 --> 3130.079
not possible

3130.88 --> 3135.2000000000003
so it's just no it's like oh you were

3133.28 --> 3137.0400000000004
never born well i'm here

3135.2 --> 3138.7999999999997
it's like oh so it doesn't make

3137.04 --> 3140.4
chronological sense well you're time

3138.8 --> 3142.7200000000003
traveling now aren't you

3140.4 --> 3143.6800000000003
so does it have to make chronological

3142.72 --> 3146.9599999999996
sense you mean

3143.68 --> 3148.0
in your mind it has to work has it well

3146.96 --> 3151.2
you just freaking

3148.0 --> 3153.359
went to another time so

3151.2 --> 3155.839
to me that means you're literally just

3153.359 --> 3158.16
taking something that is

3155.839 --> 3158.96
and moving dimensions into somewhere

3158.16 --> 3162.16
else

3158.96 --> 3165.2
it's just there there is no

3162.16 --> 3168.16
need for an origin what is just is

3165.2 --> 3171.2799999999997
there is no linear connection because it

3168.16 --> 3176.16
has been disconnected from time itself

3171.28 --> 3176.1600000000003
by moving outside a linear time

3176.64 --> 3181.839
so no that's how i see time travel

3184.72 --> 3190.64
you just go there

3187.76 --> 3193.28
because i don't know most things if you

3190.64 --> 3196.64
would draw a natural consequence

3193.28 --> 3199.8390000000004
to oh you could prevent

3196.64 --> 3201.68
yourself from existing well if that were

3199.839 --> 3204.48
the case

3201.68 --> 3205.2
then you would have already done it you

3204.48 --> 3208.0
see

3205.2 --> 3208.3999999999996
because what you're gonna do in the past

3208.0 --> 3210.559
from

3208.4 --> 3212.8
yourself in the future perspective it

3210.559 --> 3216.2400000000002
has already happened

3212.8 --> 3217.6800000000003
so either it cannot be done it never

3216.24 --> 3223.839
will be done

3217.68 --> 3223.839
or it simply doesn't matter

3227.92 --> 3231.079
[Music]

3234.839 --> 3237.839
so

3243.04 --> 3247.599
because in my opinion if you time travel

3245.599 --> 3248.319
you literally go to another dimension

3247.599 --> 3252.319
and thereby

3248.319 --> 3252.319
sever your entire connection

3253.2 --> 3257.359
to your origin because you stepped out

3256.24 --> 3262.5589999999997
of your

3257.359 --> 3262.5589999999997
time chronological normal

3262.839 --> 3265.839
being

3266.24 --> 3272.24
so yeah you just go to another place

3269.599 --> 3273.119
you experience a cycle that was a part

3272.24 --> 3276.0
of you

3273.119 --> 3277.76
but that already happened to you it

3276.0 --> 3280.319
cannot unhappen

3277.76 --> 3281.44
but you can create something else in

3280.319 --> 3283.359
instead

3281.44 --> 3285.92
and then if you would move back there

3283.359 --> 3290.64
would be no nothing to connect onto

3285.92 --> 3293.839
once you return but you're still there

3290.64 --> 3293.839
because you are

3297.28 --> 3300.48
so it would be rather a case of just

3299.359 --> 3307.839
getting unstuck

3300.48 --> 3307.839
in chronological time

3317.28 --> 3320.6400000000003
right zach time is in space to travel

3319.44 --> 3323.28
through indeed

3320.64 --> 3323.92
well especially by einstein standards

3323.28 --> 3329.0400000000004
it's

3323.92 --> 3329.04
it's nonsense it's it's science fiction

3329.839 --> 3335.839
it's still very amusing though

3338.2 --> 3341.3399999999997
[Music]

3363.04 --> 3377.839
all right but yeah

3366.559 --> 3377.8390000000004
time travel come on

3388.839 --> 3391.839
so

3405.839 --> 3409.04
right yeah well aries 106 look if

3408.319 --> 3412.5589999999997
there's

3409.04 --> 3413.52
concerning time travel if there was such

3412.559 --> 3419.0400000000004
a thing

3413.52 --> 3422.4
it would only ever be viably achievable

3419.04 --> 3424.48
in a stationary flat earth because

3422.4 --> 3426.64
as i brought this on the scene a long

3424.48 --> 3429.04
time ago on the flat earth debates

3426.64 --> 3429.68
if the earth was a ball moving in space

3429.04 --> 3431.68
and all that

3429.68 --> 3434.16
that means it's constantly moving that

3431.68 --> 3437.68
means if you literally displace yourself

3434.16 --> 3440.24
in time and space to another time

3437.68 --> 3442.24
when you are in that location unless you

3440.24 --> 3444.319
can literally

3442.24 --> 3447.04
have the celestial charge of every

3444.319 --> 3448.079
position exactly in the euclidean sense

3447.04 --> 3451.2
the entire

3448.079 --> 3451.6800000000003
the galactic position unless you account

3451.2 --> 3454.16
for that

3451.68 --> 3457.44
you're literally just going to reappear

3454.16 --> 3457.44
in vacuum of space

3457.839 --> 3464.16
with the earth way hundreds of

3460.96 --> 3467.52
billions of kilometers in the distance

3464.16 --> 3467.52
because it's not there yet

3468.799 --> 3475.839
so if time travel was real

3478.16 --> 3481.2
wait that's not a right train of thought

3480.319 --> 3483.68
it's just that

3481.2 --> 3484.8799999999997
time travel could only ever work on a

3483.68 --> 3488.5589999999997
flat earth

3484.88 --> 3489.599
if it could work at all it has to be

3488.559 --> 3491.0400000000004
stationary

3489.599 --> 3493.28
because otherwise you're just going to

3491.04 --> 3497.7599999999998
jump into nothing

3493.28 --> 3500.96
because the ball earth isn't there yet

3497.76 --> 3503.5200000000004
or is past it if you go into the future

3500.96 --> 3505.839
unless you have an automated system that

3503.52 --> 3506.48
knows the exact euclidean galactic

3505.839 --> 3510.0
position

3506.48 --> 3513.44
of the earth in every time

3510.0 --> 3515.76
does it does anybody know that exactly

3513.44 --> 3517.04
like how much of a risk is it to be just

3515.76 --> 3519.599
slightly off it's just

3517.04 --> 3520.96
just slightly off just the through 100

3519.599 --> 3522.88
000 kilometers that you

3520.96 --> 3524.96
suddenly appear in the middle of a

3522.88 --> 3531.839
vacuum of space

3524.96 --> 3531.839
you know it's crazy

3542.839 --> 3545.839
hmm

3550.4 --> 3559.839
what are you talking about

3566.559 --> 3570.6400000000003
oh the pyramids how were the pyramids

3570.839 --> 3576.319
built

3572.64 --> 3579.92
i think they were built with a giants

3576.319 --> 3584.079
partial levitation electrostatic

3579.92 --> 3587.2000000000003
levitation or depolarization levitation

3584.079 --> 3589.8390000000004
and stone molding indeed so like a

3587.2 --> 3591.839
super advanced concrete except it's not

3589.839 --> 3601.839
concrete

3591.839 --> 3601.839
it just really turns into stone

3604.88 --> 3608.6400000000003
moved just mold in place

3609.839 --> 3614.72
well unless you're suggesting that there

3612.4 --> 3616.88
is like

3614.72 --> 3617.7599999999998
that all of it is cast and i don't think

3616.88 --> 3620.6400000000003
it is because

3617.76 --> 3623.2000000000003
the pyramid also contains very specific

3620.64 --> 3625.68
types of rocks

3623.2 --> 3627.359
that have literally been cut from

3625.68 --> 3631.2
original places

3627.359 --> 3633.68
and they bear the complete markings of

3631.2 --> 3637.1189999999997
natural formed rock

3633.68 --> 3638.799
that cannot have been cast from scratch

3637.119 --> 3640.96
because then it would not have those

3638.799 --> 3644.88
specific patterns in them

3640.96 --> 3648.2400000000002
so i think that rather solid rock

3644.88 --> 3651.28
can be made into temporary putty

3648.24 --> 3654.0789999999997
then put into place and basically

3651.28 --> 3656.079
squeeze it in seal it so that it fits

3654.079 --> 3658.7200000000003
perfectly in its surrounding like clay

3656.079 --> 3662.079
and then you solidify it again and then

3658.72 --> 3664.48
it's just perfectly sealed

3662.079 --> 3666.0
it's not like the entire pyramid is not

3664.48 --> 3669.52
just a giant

3666.0 --> 3672.799
mold casting project

3669.52 --> 3676.0
absolutely not there are real pieces of

3672.799 --> 3676.0
rock used in there

3683.04 --> 3688.48
right so it's more likely that they

3687.599 --> 3691.28
managed to

3688.48 --> 3691.52
find out a way how to temporarily turn

3691.28 --> 3695.0400000000004
it

3691.52 --> 3698.799
into a putty that you can

3695.04 --> 3713.839
mold it and then have it restore back to

3698.799 --> 3713.839
its original hardness

3718.319 --> 3722.88
the blocks are not uniform either

3724.839 --> 3727.839
when

3734.89 --> 3738.0099999999998
[Music]

3756.24 --> 3761.2799999999997
what are you talking about does

3759.359 --> 3762.72
ancient alien have to do with any of

3761.28 --> 3767.039
that this

3762.72 --> 3782.83
it's just atlantea atlantis it's

3767.039 --> 3785.96
the atlantean era

3782.83 --> 3785.96
[Music]

3788.079 --> 3794.48
hmm yes ironfee yeah

3791.599 --> 3795.76
well this guy apparently does have some

3794.48 --> 3800.799
of this ancient

3795.76 --> 3803.5200000000004
technique because he did some things

3800.799 --> 3805.839
with that or at least it's heavily

3803.52 --> 3807.839
suggested i can't really prove it

3805.839 --> 3811.68
i think it's there i think that

3807.839 --> 3813.52
technology does exist

3811.68 --> 3816.48
it's being withheld because it's

3813.52 --> 3818.4
probably not as economically viable

3816.48 --> 3820.319
because people that are in control

3818.4 --> 3824.7200000000003
currently they want

3820.319 --> 3829.2
quickly made and easily demolished

3824.72 --> 3832.5589999999997
structures and when you start stone cast

3829.2 --> 3835.5989999999997
and stone mold giant monolithic

3832.559 --> 3836.079
rock structures it's probably not as

3835.599 --> 3839.92
easy

3836.079 --> 3842.0
to to yeah to take it apart again

3839.92 --> 3843.92
so they just want easy quick

3842.0 --> 3845.76
constructions they don't give a [ __ ]

3843.92 --> 3848.48
whether it's gonna leave a lot of junk

3845.76 --> 3848.48
all of the time

3849.119 --> 3855.52
because big stone

3852.24 --> 3859.4399999999996
buildings are a hassle

3855.52 --> 3862.559
they can't easily be modified they can't

3859.44 --> 3864.64
just quickly be taken away again to make

3862.559 --> 3867.599
room for something else

3864.64 --> 3868.16
and that's what the people in control

3867.599 --> 3870.319
want

3868.16 --> 3872.5589999999997
that's what they want they want just a

3870.319 --> 3872.5589999999997
big

3873.599 --> 3877.039
playground where people constantly build

3876.0 --> 3879.119
new stuff

3877.039 --> 3880.7200000000003
keep busy and then it breaks apart again

3879.119 --> 3883.039
and they build again and they just want

3880.72 --> 3885.0389999999998
that sandbox effect where everybody just

3883.039 --> 3887.599
keeps on making sand castles they don't

3885.039 --> 3890.559
want any permanent structures

3887.599 --> 3892.2400000000002
none they don't want any permanent

3890.559 --> 3894.3190000000004
structures

3892.24 --> 3896.64
if anything they want to take them all

3894.319 --> 3900.799
away

3896.64 --> 3903.2
because it anchors people's memories

3900.799 --> 3904.319
it's like generational observations and

3903.2 --> 3907.359
memories

3904.319 --> 3909.88
that take away from their control

3907.359 --> 3911.0389999999998
where they want everybody's mind to be

3909.88 --> 3914.079
completely

3911.039 --> 3917.119
malleable and fluid

3914.079 --> 3920.2400000000002
so instead of making the rock

3917.119 --> 3921.44
fluid and using it as putty they now

3920.24 --> 3924.24
resort to

3921.44 --> 3926.079
molding people's mind instead and doing

3924.24 --> 3928.72
that whole process on

3926.079 --> 3930.96
spiritual humanity and not so much more

3928.72 --> 3935.68
on the rocks

3930.96 --> 3951.839
it's kind of metaphorical that way

3935.68 --> 3951.839
right i'll be back in two minutes

4039.31 --> 4042.54
[Music]

4046.839 --> 4049.839
yep

4051.76 --> 4055.6800000000003
huh let's go to here there audio fight

4054.24 --> 4058.5589999999997
me

4055.68 --> 4059.0389999999998
cardio and arwen wait you you actually

4058.559 --> 4062.2400000000002
work

4059.039 --> 4063.44
out while listening to me oh that's

4062.24 --> 4067.1189999999997
weird

4063.44 --> 4067.119
didn't know it was that stimulating

4067.68 --> 4073.52
or triggering i don't know

4071.28 --> 4075.92
so i'm not much of a workout guy myself

4073.52 --> 4078.16
although in springtime i always do get

4075.92 --> 4080.88
like i have to beef up i have to beef up

4078.16 --> 4084.0789999999997
to show off against a girl or something

4080.88 --> 4086.1600000000003
have that instinct definitely kicks in

4084.079 --> 4088.319
every springtime

4086.16 --> 4090.5589999999997
it usually just ends up frustrating me a

4088.319 --> 4090.5589999999997
lot

4093.52 --> 4097.119
but every spring time it happens

4102.839 --> 4105.839
right

4104.08 --> 4107.5199999999995
that measure two thousand years from now

4105.839 --> 4108.64
people will think that harry potter was

4107.52 --> 4111.4400000000005
real

4108.64 --> 4111.4400000000005
no they won't

4113.759 --> 4118.799
but it might captivate a lot of people's

4117.12 --> 4122.3189999999995
fantasy

4118.799 --> 4123.679
like man like if harry potter wasn't

4122.319 --> 4126.080000000001
just open fiction

4123.679 --> 4126.799
let's say it was like an ancient book i

4126.08 --> 4130.4
would be like

4126.799 --> 4132.799
holy [ __ ] where is that hidden location

4130.4 --> 4136.799
where's the space in between space

4132.799 --> 4139.12
because hey i'm open-minded about

4136.799 --> 4140.64
potential spatial non-linearity of

4139.12 --> 4144.159
everything in the realm

4140.64 --> 4145.679
so yeah i've even suggested that like

4144.159 --> 4147.679
there could be places where there's

4145.679 --> 4149.4400000000005
simply more room than actually fits

4147.679 --> 4152.2390000000005
there

4149.44 --> 4154.0
even like spatially concealed like there

4152.239 --> 4157.2789999999995
is like a mini

4154.0 --> 4160.48
portal loop in places like a knot where

4157.279 --> 4163.359
a piece of space ties in that's not

4160.48 --> 4166.239
lit literally linearly correct connected

4163.359 --> 4166.2390000000005
to everything else

4166.4 --> 4170.639999999999
and yeah harry potter does address that

4168.799 --> 4172.56
sort of thing

4170.64 --> 4175.359
so if i wouldn't know it was science

4172.56 --> 4180.799
fiction that i might be like wow

4175.359 --> 4180.799
i want to find that secret place somehow

4184.0 --> 4188.08
it sounds really appealing actually even

4186.0 --> 4190.239
though i know it's fiction

4188.08 --> 4192.4
just to find a secret place that was

4190.239 --> 4194.718999999999
something that even as a very little kid

4192.4 --> 4196.96
i was absolutely obsessed with

4194.719 --> 4199.04
like i wanted to find that secret place

4196.96 --> 4199.36
i wanted to find a place that nobody

4199.04 --> 4202.719
knew

4199.36 --> 4204.48
existed and i would think that i could

4202.719 --> 4206.08
find it anywhere i was convinced like

4204.48 --> 4208.159
yeah that could literally be

4206.08 --> 4209.44
every town every force there's just

4208.159 --> 4212.719
space

4209.44 --> 4217.199
that nobody knows about and i just want

4212.719 --> 4219.36
to find it

4217.199 --> 4221.28
i had kind of a fantastical mind like

4219.36 --> 4223.679
that

4221.28 --> 4225.5199999999995
but yeah i could conceive of such a

4223.679 --> 4229.1990000000005
thing

4225.52 --> 4232.64
and it's kind of suggested in

4229.199 --> 4235.36
in television and science fiction

4232.64 --> 4237.1990000000005
and i was very eager to say like okay so

4235.36 --> 4239.92
maybe that is real maybe that's up for

4237.199 --> 4241.678999999999
somebody to figure out how that works

4239.92 --> 4243.6
or maybe it's already figured out that

4241.679 --> 4248.96
it's just completely secret

4243.6 --> 4248.96
they want they the first arrival of they

4249.199 --> 4253.678999999999
they want it all for themselves and

4251.44 --> 4254.719
we're just stuck to the normal linear

4253.679 --> 4259.84
time

4254.719 --> 4259.84
space situation

4261.92 --> 4273.84
but yeah that was me when i was young

4265.199 --> 4273.839999999999
very young

4279.52 --> 4283.92
but yeah can you imagine just it's a

4281.679 --> 4284.56
science fiction situation that you would

4283.92 --> 4286.96
find these

4284.56 --> 4288.400000000001
ancient ruins oh by the way i've used

4286.96 --> 4290.96
this in my dnd

4288.4 --> 4292.48
campaign right that there's an ancient

4290.96 --> 4294.4
ruin somewhere

4292.48 --> 4297.5199999999995
that's even known to be there it's just

4294.4 --> 4301.839999999999
that nobody's really that interested

4297.52 --> 4301.84
and then one moment you go there

4302.4 --> 4305.92
and you find some kind of secret

4304.56 --> 4308.88
entrance now that's

4305.92 --> 4309.92
like that's a dream for a whole bunch of

4308.88 --> 4312.32
people

4309.92 --> 4314.4800000000005
you would find this secret place in some

4312.32 --> 4316.4
ancient ruins it's like can't get more

4314.48 --> 4319.199
mysterious and

4316.4 --> 4321.28
and all that than that and maybe you

4319.199 --> 4323.599999999999
would find some kind of time gate into

4321.28 --> 4326.19
where it was originally made and then

4323.6 --> 4327.76
yeah i don't know

4326.19 --> 4331.36
[Music]

4327.76 --> 4331.360000000001
then you got a science fiction story

4339.44 --> 4357.839999999999
just f w i w what does

4342.48 --> 4357.839999999999
that mean

4359.199 --> 4364.639999999999
just these shorts i don't for what it's

4361.84 --> 4364.64
worth oh okay

4367.92 --> 4373.04
i'm not i'm not really a fan of shorts

4371.679 --> 4374.8
like that

4373.04 --> 4376.88
because people do that [ __ ] all the time

4374.8 --> 4378.400000000001
it's like how about you just spell out

4376.88 --> 4379.6
what you're saying how about just

4378.4 --> 4382.32
honoring

4379.6 --> 4385.84
the use of the language by just actually

4382.32 --> 4385.84
saying it

4388.64 --> 4399.84
but that's me

4413.6 --> 4418.320000000001
you usually play a long game of chess

4424.84 --> 4429.1990000000005
okay

4426.88 --> 4431.12
i don't quite cut it for weight lifting

4429.199 --> 4441.839999999999
but for stadio card

4431.12 --> 4441.84
cardio okay i guess

4453.28 --> 4457.36
i'm tired of seeing people in their

4455.8 --> 4469.84
skivvies

4457.36 --> 4469.839999999999
what is that

4474.96 --> 4477.199
oh

4480.0 --> 4483.84
uh what

4496.159 --> 4498.4
what

4502.56 --> 4505.6
yeah i get that now but what are you

4504.8 --> 4507.679
talking about

4505.6 --> 4509.280000000001
you're tired of seeing people in their

4507.679 --> 4510.88
underwear well maybe you

4509.28 --> 4512.32
shouldn't look at them when they're

4510.88 --> 4525.84
almost naked then

4512.32 --> 4525.84
what the [ __ ] what are you talking about

4526.4 --> 4532.32
like who the [ __ ] is where it's walking

4529.52 --> 4532.320000000001
in their underwear

4533.679 --> 4539.36
unless you're talking about south of the

4536.239 --> 4541.919999999999
equator or something

4539.36 --> 4544.32
people in public are like that oh

4541.92 --> 4546.2390000000005
they're not over here especially not now

4544.32 --> 4548.88
because it's freaking cold i don't know

4546.239 --> 4550.48
what the hell you're talking about

4548.88 --> 4552.400000000001
don't know what kind of people you're

4550.48 --> 4552.879999999999
hanging around with but the people that

4552.4 --> 4554.4
i know

4552.88 --> 4556.400000000001
are not walking around in their

4554.4 --> 4559.5199999999995
underwear not even

4556.4 --> 4559.5199999999995
in the heat of summer

4559.679 --> 4567.84
like unless it's really insanely hot

4563.6 --> 4567.84
and then you still try to minimize it

4575.12 --> 4581.84
jersey girls

4578.159 --> 4581.839999999999
oh okay

4598.0 --> 4602.96
aren't they cold like what the [ __ ]

4601.12 --> 4604.32
who's gonna do that during this type of

4602.96 --> 4606.84
weather

4604.32 --> 4608.0
like during this time in of the year in

4606.84 --> 4612.56
jersey

4608.0 --> 4613.92
in which it is winter so i don't get it

4612.56 --> 4623.84
i don't get where you bring that up

4613.92 --> 4623.84
right now

4649.12 --> 4655.36
hmm okay matthew mitchell what what are

4652.159 --> 4655.36
you referring to there

4655.92 --> 4659.6
they designed built and demolished a

4659.04 --> 4663.5199999999995
thousand

4659.6 --> 4664.159000000001
acre showpiece in late 1800s what are

4663.52 --> 4666.4800000000005
you talking

4664.159 --> 4666.48
about

4668.4 --> 4673.839999999999
oh the chicago world fair

4671.44 --> 4675.199
no they didn't actually they did nothing

4673.84 --> 4678.400000000001
of the sort

4675.199 --> 4680.719
they just dressed up

4678.4 --> 4682.5599999999995
ancient tartarian buildings that were

4680.719 --> 4685.44
there claimed they made it

4682.56 --> 4686.88
and then destroyed it that's what they

4685.44 --> 4690.5599999999995
actually did they didn't build

4686.88 --> 4694.8
[ __ ] nothing they did

4690.56 --> 4694.8
they did not build [ __ ]

4702.64 --> 4710.159000000001
came there it was all there they said

4706.0 --> 4714.239
we made this and then they destroyed it

4710.159 --> 4714.239
that's what they did they did not build

4718.84 --> 4721.84
anything

4727.679 --> 4731.52
it was just for them a giant excuse to

4730.0 --> 4733.52
start tearing down

4731.52 --> 4735.679
tartarian buildings in order to

4733.52 --> 4737.92
reinforce the entire false history

4735.679 --> 4740.0
narrative

4737.92 --> 4741.12
that's what they did they destroyed the

4740.0 --> 4744.48
old buildings because

4741.12 --> 4747.84
they can't be there because america was

4744.48 --> 4749.919999999999
just forming they

4747.84 --> 4751.04
they couldn't have been there because

4749.92 --> 4752.96
that would mean that

4751.04 --> 4755.92
everything was a lie so they just have

4752.96 --> 4758.32
to tear down these ancient buildings

4755.92 --> 4760.56
or say that it wasn't built by americans

4758.32 --> 4764.08
at some point

4760.56 --> 4766.080000000001
which makes no damn sense and that's

4764.08 --> 4768.88
it and yeah there were apparently a

4766.08 --> 4772.08
whole lot of these ancient buildings

4768.88 --> 4777.84
in chicago from ancient tertaria and

4772.08 --> 4777.84
they just had to destroy it

4786.48 --> 4790.48
wouldn't that just be fascinating though

4788.4 --> 4793.44
you know it just you're a group of rich

4790.48 --> 4796.32
people whatever you go to some place

4793.44 --> 4797.599999999999
that's been like that forever ancient

4796.32 --> 4798.799999999999
buildings and then you could just go

4797.6 --> 4802.400000000001
there and say like

4798.8 --> 4802.88
yeah we built that yeah we built that

4802.4 --> 4805.199
thing

4802.88 --> 4806.2390000000005
right there that you've been staring at

4805.199 --> 4809.36
for like five

4806.239 --> 4810.959999999999
or six generations since you further i

4809.36 --> 4812.4
first arrived here like hundreds of

4810.96 --> 4815.28
years ago

4812.4 --> 4816.5599999999995
we built that and we're going to destroy

4815.28 --> 4818.639
it now

4816.56 --> 4821.120000000001
that's pretty much what they did it's

4818.639 --> 4823.84
it's maximum grabbler it's just like

4821.12 --> 4825.76
no we are just going to destroy it it

4823.84 --> 4827.52
makes no sense why but we're going to do

4825.76 --> 4829.679
it and you're not going to stop us

4827.52 --> 4832.159000000001
because we're going to use exceptional

4829.679 --> 4835.52
force if you try to stop us

4832.159 --> 4838.879999999999
and you will never even know why

4835.52 --> 4841.040000000001
because if you're all in the dark

4838.88 --> 4842.0
and you're going to be more in the dark

4841.04 --> 4845.199
after

4842.0 --> 4846.0
then we can do whatever the [ __ ] we want

4845.199 --> 4847.839999999999
and you won't even

4846.0 --> 4851.36
really stop us because you don't even

4847.84 --> 4851.360000000001
understand what the [ __ ] we're doing

4852.0 --> 4859.52
that's what happened in the chicago fair

4855.52 --> 4862.56
world fair came in claimed it their own

4859.52 --> 4862.56
then destroyed it

4863.25 --> 4866.699
[Music]

4870.63 --> 4874.8
[Music]

4873.12 --> 4876.48
to be honest i hope that all the people

4874.8 --> 4879.28
that organized it all

4876.48 --> 4880.4
got some kind of plague and died

4879.28 --> 4889.04
horrible deaths

4880.4 --> 4891.12
they probably would have

4889.04 --> 4892.719
and i hope that torture of their

4891.12 --> 4894.719
ancestors

4892.719 --> 4897.199
carries on throughout the bloodline if

4894.719 --> 4899.6
they're not all dead yet

4897.199 --> 4901.599999999999
i hope that torture of that level of

4899.6 --> 4904.96
destruction of what you committed

4901.6 --> 4908.08
can never be removed from your bloodline

4904.96 --> 4910.2390000000005
until at some point

4908.08 --> 4911.28
all your ancestors are just going to

4910.239 --> 4914.0
kill themselves

4911.28 --> 4916.4
how about that how about that for a

4914.0 --> 4918.8
consequence for your [ __ ] grabblers

4916.4 --> 4920.96
in your scumbags

4918.8 --> 4922.88
right you want to destroy things you

4920.96 --> 4925.52
think you can get away with it

4922.88 --> 4927.679
well it's going to be torture for your

4925.52 --> 4931.67
for you and your offspring from there on

4927.679 --> 4933.6
until it's all gone how about that

4931.67 --> 4945.84
[Music]

4933.6 --> 4945.84
your [ __ ] darkness

4946.56 --> 4950.080000000001
because i think it by the way that it

4948.159 --> 4954.638999999999
does happen i think that

4950.08 --> 4957.36
dark deeds even secret ones

4954.639 --> 4958.159000000001
they carry on through the generations

4957.36 --> 4962.159
even though the

4958.159 --> 4966.159
your ancestors might not even know

4962.159 --> 4969.199
what your grandfather or whatever done

4966.159 --> 4970.5599999999995
you don't know you still get this in as

4969.199 --> 4973.44
a bonus prize

4970.56 --> 4975.120000000001
yeah oh you think you can do something

4973.44 --> 4978.638999999999
and get away with it

4975.12 --> 4979.199
in the face of god no no you will have

4978.639 --> 4983.6
the

4979.199 --> 4987.04
full price even after death

4983.6 --> 4989.6
even after death the full price of it

4987.04 --> 4991.679
in this world not even in wherever

4989.6 --> 4992.8
you're going to hell or whatever how

4991.679 --> 4995.36
that works right

4992.8 --> 4996.320000000001
no in the physical world you will have

4995.36 --> 5000.159
the full

4996.32 --> 5004.0
price because what you did will echo

5000.159 --> 5005.04
on in the in the generations to follow

5004.0 --> 5008.08
they will

5005.04 --> 5010.32
pay the price for what you did they will

5008.08 --> 5014.96
take this suffering

5010.32 --> 5018.4
that you could not or refuse to

5014.96 --> 5020.719
yeah how about that for a forecast

5018.4 --> 5023.04
yeah can you feel it burning can you

5020.719 --> 5023.6
feel the burning sacrifice of everything

5023.04 --> 5026.48
you are

5023.6 --> 5028.08
even throughout the timeless realm can

5026.48 --> 5032.799999999999
you feel it burning

5028.08 --> 5032.8
what you've done yeah

5035.679 --> 5041.679
i hope you do i'm not addressing people

5038.56 --> 5041.679
in chat hair by the way

5041.84 --> 5047.76
although yeah some of you might be in

5044.8 --> 5051.1990000000005
exactly that position

5047.76 --> 5052.08
some very far distant relative might

5051.199 --> 5055.44
have done something

5052.08 --> 5057.84
absolutely horrendous atrocious

5055.44 --> 5059.678999999999
being part of a disgusting conspiracy

5057.84 --> 5062.159000000001
that is absolute evil

5059.679 --> 5064.0
not talking ooh joe sacrifice no just

5062.159 --> 5067.199
destroying good things

5064.0 --> 5068.239
specifically like really permanently

5067.199 --> 5072.879999999999
scarring

5068.239 --> 5075.44
the world in ways in ways that

5072.88 --> 5075.92
subsequent generations don't even can't

5075.44 --> 5078.638999999999
even

5075.92 --> 5080.56
see that you did that because they lost

5078.639 --> 5084.159000000001
the memory of what it is

5080.56 --> 5086.4800000000005
that you destroyed right so it might

5084.159 --> 5088.799999999999
seem very convenient i think that the

5086.48 --> 5089.28
sin of that sort of destruction carries

5088.8 --> 5091.76
on

5089.28 --> 5092.639
permanently over the generations that

5091.76 --> 5095.1990000000005
follow until

5092.639 --> 5097.679
all those generations eventually just

5095.199 --> 5100.5599999999995
implode and destroy themselves

5097.679 --> 5102.0
get completely grabbled completely

5100.56 --> 5104.639
squirmy and weak

5102.0 --> 5105.92
and just die i think that is the

5104.639 --> 5113.84
long-term price

5105.92 --> 5113.84
for such acts

5126.96 --> 5131.92
hmm yes steam heating

5130.0 --> 5134.159
yeah isn't it isn't that interesting

5131.92 --> 5134.8
it's like early industrial central

5134.159 --> 5141.839999999999
heating

5134.8 --> 5141.84
very fascinating

5142.32 --> 5155.84
it's a good system

5172.239 --> 5177.04
supposed to be really healthy for you is

5175.12 --> 5180.4
it

5177.04 --> 5181.44
it's just it's like a central heating

5180.4 --> 5184.96
system except

5181.44 --> 5188.638999999999
with steam heat instead not

5184.96 --> 5191.679
liquid heated water but steam pressed

5188.639 --> 5194.32
is that's particularly healthy

5191.679 --> 5196.56
i don't know if it is i don't it's like

5194.32 --> 5198.639
central heating in any sort of form

5196.56 --> 5200.56
whether it's steam heating or water

5198.639 --> 5202.2390000000005
heating it does have kind of an

5200.56 --> 5206.080000000001
influence on the air

5202.239 --> 5209.04
i personally experience central heating

5206.08 --> 5210.239
not as pleasant i get it does something

5209.04 --> 5213.44
weird to my skin

5210.239 --> 5215.759999999999
i can feel it when it's going

5213.44 --> 5217.5199999999995
like when it's when the hot water is

5215.76 --> 5217.84
like rushing through it and it's ready i

5217.52 --> 5221.1990000000005
can

5217.84 --> 5225.84
feel it doing something to me

5221.199 --> 5225.839999999999
my skin doesn't like it

5226.48 --> 5229.919999999999
but yeah the actual steam the water

5229.12 --> 5231.92
vapor

5229.92 --> 5234.4
yeah that's something else well central

5231.92 --> 5236.4800000000005
heating system is not going to vent that

5234.4 --> 5238.879999999999
of course it's going to keep it closed

5236.48 --> 5241.199
otherwise it's a leak

5238.88 --> 5241.1990000000005
right

5243.6 --> 5247.52
healthy because your building is well

5245.52 --> 5250.88
ventilated no

5247.52 --> 5253.92
no central heating and even steam

5250.88 --> 5256.96
based central heating

5253.92 --> 5260.8
that is not a ventilation system

5256.96 --> 5263.28
that's not what that is if it was open

5260.8 --> 5264.88
that means that everything would be wet

5263.28 --> 5267.04
constantly wet because there would be

5264.88 --> 5272.56
constantly water

5267.04 --> 5272.56
vapor entering no that's not what that

5278.84 --> 5281.84
is

5299.28 --> 5303.199
okay george sanford

5305.84 --> 5309.84
if you say so

5336.08 --> 5342.239
okay so that is then very different

5339.36 --> 5343.599999999999
from a central heating type of system

5342.239 --> 5346.0
it's not closed

5343.6 --> 5346.8
i don't know i this is the first time

5346.0 --> 5348.96
i'm hearing of

5346.8 --> 5350.0
that specifically i automatically as

5348.96 --> 5352.88
some assumed that

5350.0 --> 5355.84
it was tied in with another form of

5352.88 --> 5357.76
central heating where it's a closed loop

5355.84 --> 5359.52
but apparently it isn't so i'm

5357.76 --> 5361.679
completely at a loss right now

5359.52 --> 5363.6
with that if it is a completely

5361.679 --> 5364.08
different type of system then i don't

5363.6 --> 5365.92
know how

5364.08 --> 5379.36
the [ __ ] it works i'm not gonna comment

5365.92 --> 5382.56
on it

5379.36 --> 5385.12
in a closed loop that's all very cute

5382.56 --> 5386.400000000001
yeah well in that case if it is in a

5385.12 --> 5387.84
closed loop then i was

5386.4 --> 5390.839999999999
pretty much right about everything i

5387.84 --> 5392.0
said because that's the natural

5390.84 --> 5395.52
consequences

5392.0 --> 5396.96
don't know what being well ventilated

5395.52 --> 5398.56
of the building in the region that's

5396.96 --> 5407.84
supposed to be heating up has to do with

5398.56 --> 5407.84
that at all

5421.679 --> 5435.84
i don't know what you're talking about

5423.04 --> 5435.84
man i don't know

5442.8 --> 5445.84
if you just mean open circulation

5445.36 --> 5448.5599999999995
because

5445.84 --> 5450.32
heat radiates and it makes the air rise

5448.56 --> 5453.120000000001
and then has to circulate

5450.32 --> 5455.36
if that is what you mean that's not

5453.12 --> 5458.4
steam radiators that's just

5455.36 --> 5459.04
all heating every single form of it it

5458.4 --> 5462.0
always

5459.04 --> 5464.4
is dependent on that yeah the hot air

5462.0 --> 5466.08
that is coming off it needs to circulate

5464.4 --> 5468.159
and if it's not designed properly then

5466.08 --> 5468.88
can they get locked in and lost yeah i

5468.159 --> 5471.44
know that

5468.88 --> 5474.56
that's just heating in general has

5471.44 --> 5477.919999999999
nothing to do with that specific system

5474.56 --> 5483.04
being very confusing but

5477.92 --> 5483.04
what you're putting out to me

5486.159 --> 5491.839999999999
okay here we go again sure

5516.84 --> 5519.84
so

5543.84 --> 5547.84
right anyway

5549.04 --> 5554.239
[Music]

5551.44 --> 5560.638999999999
got half an hour more to go getting kind

5554.239 --> 5564.48
of hungry wow

5560.639 --> 5564.4800000000005
what an odd contrast out there

5567.6 --> 5574.0
on this side it's all blue

5570.96 --> 5577.44
a couple of trails though and then on

5574.0 --> 5580.48
that side it's completely gray

5577.44 --> 5583.839999999999
and cloud covered

5580.48 --> 5587.5199999999995
like a split into

5583.84 --> 5592.08
over here blue

5587.52 --> 5592.080000000001
and over there it's cloudy

5600.84 --> 5603.84
weird

5603.92 --> 5607.6
hey julio pevan good to see you

5607.73 --> 5611.83
[Music]

5612.719 --> 5617.84
steam is very corrosive

5621.36 --> 5628.4
well if connected to open air

5625.92 --> 5630.25
sure if it's in a closed system though

5628.4 --> 5633.5199999999995
it's different

5630.25 --> 5633.52
[Music]

5645.01 --> 5648.1990000000005
[Music]

5656.84 --> 5659.84
right

5664.67 --> 5670.86
[Music]

5667.679 --> 5676.12
buildings were made of stone right

5670.86 --> 5676.12
[Music]

5678.96 --> 5683.84
it also by the way means that if you

5681.84 --> 5684.639
have steam heating and it is in a closed

5683.84 --> 5687.1990000000005
system that

5684.639 --> 5689.04
a leak can completely [ __ ] things up

5687.199 --> 5692.159
really badly

5689.04 --> 5694.8
especially if you don't discover it for

5692.159 --> 5694.799999999999
a long time

5697.6 --> 5700.719
because at the escape point there's

5699.52 --> 5705.040000000001
going to be rust

5700.719 --> 5705.04
situations all over the place

5709.92 --> 5714.0
yeah and dangerous indeed because if it

5711.76 --> 5716.0
like actually breaks

5714.0 --> 5718.239
yeah you got an out-of-control steam

5716.0 --> 5718.239
vent

5719.84 --> 5724.719
and everything's going to depressurize

5721.84 --> 5724.719
it's going to be a mess

5725.52 --> 5729.84
potentially explosive

5730.96 --> 5734.4
and that's probably why they don't use

5733.04 --> 5736.4
it that much anymore

5734.4 --> 5738.32
because of the potential danger that

5736.4 --> 5741.5199999999995
comes with it and they now just use

5738.32 --> 5744.32
liquid central heating with

5741.52 --> 5746.2390000000005
heated liquid water because it's a

5744.32 --> 5757.84
little bit safer because if one of those

5746.239 --> 5757.839999999999
breaks things don't explode

5784.719 --> 5788.88
all right big explosive problems with

5786.4 --> 5792.239
steams well

5788.88 --> 5794.88
it's like you you would need some really

5792.239 --> 5797.678999999999
specialized maintenance people

5794.88 --> 5798.0
that like as emergency mechanics would

5797.679 --> 5800.8
be

5798.0 --> 5802.32
would rush in and try to fix it and that

5800.8 --> 5804.8
might take very long and

5802.32 --> 5806.799999999999
probably be very costly because once

5804.8 --> 5813.679
something really breaks

5806.8 --> 5815.92
you got a problem a big problem

5813.679 --> 5817.36
and yeah being a mechanic at a steam

5815.92 --> 5822.0
heater

5817.36 --> 5822.0
must is potentially a hazardous job

5823.28 --> 5827.84
but there have been quite a few

5824.88 --> 5827.84
accidents with it

5839.679 --> 5846.4
gas is dangerous too well if it's going

5843.04 --> 5846.4
to be heat pressured

5862.719 --> 5866.159
heat pipes in your school

5867.44 --> 5875.599999999999
yeah but were they steam

5871.76 --> 5879.52
heat powered or was it just regular

5875.6 --> 5884.8
water hot water powered

5879.52 --> 5886.719
iron 26 which one it's a big difference

5884.8 --> 5889.04
right so that's not what we were talking

5886.719 --> 5889.04
about

5889.52 --> 5893.4400000000005
right because those are everywhere

5891.679 --> 5896.08
that's just central heating

5893.44 --> 5896.799999999999
that's just good standard center heating

5896.08 --> 5899.5199999999995
is just

5896.8 --> 5899.52
hot water

5900.48 --> 5904.4
we were talking about steam heating it's

5902.719 --> 5908.88
an older system

5904.4 --> 5908.879999999999
apparently used in industrial times

5908.96 --> 5913.36
and it was extremely effective but also

5911.44 --> 5925.839999999999
hazardous when things go wrong like

5913.36 --> 5925.839999999999
very hazardous

5928.96 --> 5932.949
[Music]

5941.92 --> 5946.8
right well george sanford

5945.04 --> 5949.119
it's pretty safe to say that they

5946.8 --> 5950.719
abandoned or made it illegal steam

5949.119 --> 5952.639
heating just because of the sheer

5950.719 --> 5955.28
amounts of accidents and people getting

5952.639 --> 5955.28
killed from it

5956.0 --> 5962.8
so they just abandoned it

5959.52 --> 5965.040000000001
even though it was probably very cost

5962.8 --> 5967.1990000000005
effective

5965.04 --> 5968.32
up until the point where [ __ ] hits the

5967.199 --> 5971.36
fan and like

5968.32 --> 5975.36
things break and explode and [ __ ]

5971.36 --> 5976.799999999999
so that's probably why it was originally

5975.36 --> 5980.239
very popular because

5976.8 --> 5982.4800000000005
it was resource wise cheap and people

5980.239 --> 5984.08
would give no shits they would just get

5982.48 --> 5985.759999999999
the profession like oh yeah you get

5984.08 --> 5987.92
killed who gives a [ __ ]

5985.76 --> 5989.76
just do it anyway like the old

5987.92 --> 5991.679
industrial mentality

5989.76 --> 5993.360000000001
just like how they built the high-rise

5991.679 --> 5995.4400000000005
buildings

5993.36 --> 5997.44
like people would just get in there even

5995.44 --> 5999.199
without some kind of security system

5997.44 --> 6000.638999999999
just like oh [ __ ] it oh somebody falls

5999.199 --> 6003.599999999999
off well then they're dead

6000.639 --> 6004.400000000001
we just move on right well in that sort

6003.6 --> 6007.52
of scenario

6004.4 --> 6011.04
using steam heated

6007.52 --> 6014.639
buildings is an option in modern day

6011.04 --> 6017.76
it's not an option anymore they they

6014.639 --> 6023.84
took that away even though it was

6017.76 --> 6023.84
probably very cost effective

6034.84 --> 6037.84
do

6040.08 --> 6044.08
new york has a massive steam heat set

6042.239 --> 6047.759999999999
wow

6044.08 --> 6051.36
so that's like this the city itself

6047.76 --> 6053.76
so they got one big steam

6051.36 --> 6053.759999999999
system

6061.28 --> 6066.0
huh okay that's interesting here we go

6063.76 --> 6066.0
again

6068.96 --> 6073.28
look i'm just i'm not saying that i

6071.6 --> 6074.719
think that steam heating should be

6073.28 --> 6076.84
abandoned

6074.719 --> 6078.88
it's good they might have perfected it

6076.84 --> 6081.6
to

6078.88 --> 6082.56
to scale down the amount of things that

6081.6 --> 6084.96
can go wrong

6082.56 --> 6086.8
dramatically so that simply you build

6084.96 --> 6090.2390000000005
the steam system with like

6086.8 --> 6093.119000000001
massive unbreakable parts

6090.239 --> 6093.5199999999995
and it just goes on forever and never

6093.119 --> 6096.239
ever

6093.52 --> 6097.119000000001
breaks down or maybe in a few hundred

6096.239 --> 6101.759999999999
years

6097.119 --> 6107.839999999999
something might give so maybe they built

6101.76 --> 6107.84
the new york steam system like that

6108.32 --> 6112.239
anyway yeah i will definitely check out

6110.32 --> 6114.4
that uh

6112.239 --> 6115.44
that documentary you found that seems

6114.4 --> 6118.839999999999
interesting

6115.44 --> 6120.48
do you want to post yeah sure post it

6118.84 --> 6122.56
here

6120.48 --> 6135.839999999999
and yeah also posted in skype that would

6122.56 --> 6135.84
be cool i'll take a look at it

6137.62 --> 6141.2699999999995
[Music]

6146.84 --> 6151.24
hmm

6148.19 --> 6151.24
[Music]

6166.88 --> 6172.4800000000005
by the way i think that steam heating

6169.44 --> 6173.5199999999995
has probably been used for a very long

6172.48 --> 6177.28
time i think that

6173.52 --> 6191.84
the romans probably even used it

6177.28 --> 6191.84
way back then

6194.48 --> 6202.799999999999
what's the largest pixie i'm i'm riding

6197.92 --> 6204.639
i'm living in one steamy traveler

6202.8 --> 6207.84
it's utrecht it's one of the biggest

6204.639 --> 6207.84
cities in the netherlands

6208.32 --> 6212.4
old infrastructure yeah

6212.56 --> 6219.84
there are some in amsterdam still but it

6228.48 --> 6235.44
i don't know i don't think we have any

6232.08 --> 6236.96
like real tartaria ancient buildings i

6235.44 --> 6240.4
think we got just

6236.96 --> 6242.32
modern applications of it

6240.4 --> 6244.638999999999
like what the freemasons at first

6242.32 --> 6247.84
started to make with it or something

6244.639 --> 6247.84
that level

6258.48 --> 6263.119
a very narrow tall buildings in

6260.56 --> 6263.119000000001
amsterdam

6264.08 --> 6270.239
right well those very narrow

6268.239 --> 6272.638999999999
tall buildings were like the first

6270.239 --> 6275.919999999999
attempts at flat apartments

6272.639 --> 6278.08
very early because amsterdam was like a

6275.92 --> 6280.08
trade city very big for important and

6278.08 --> 6281.92
they needed a lot of people

6280.08 --> 6285.36
to be able to live there so they just

6281.92 --> 6285.36
started to build those types of

6286.84 --> 6289.92
buildings

6288.08 --> 6291.44
while at the same time amsterdam is

6289.92 --> 6294.56
basically a city

6291.44 --> 6298.0
built on a swamp that

6294.56 --> 6303.84
risked sinking a lot so they just built

6298.0 --> 6303.84
tall [ __ ]

6322.65 --> 6325.759999999999
[Music]

6329.84 --> 6334.08
yeah steamy traveler you completely

6331.76 --> 6336.56
missed it we were actually talking about

6334.08 --> 6339.92
steam heating systems

6336.56 --> 6339.92
for quite a while in the show

6341.04 --> 6347.04
how are they heated i don't know

6344.56 --> 6349.4400000000005
central heating it's not that hard to

6347.04 --> 6349.44
install

6350.32 --> 6354.08
and they probably originally were heated

6353.679 --> 6357.119
through

6354.08 --> 6360.159
just stoves

6357.119 --> 6360.159
just a fireplace

6365.76 --> 6372.159000000001
although yeah the really bigger

6369.04 --> 6374.0
buildings i don't know if you want to

6372.159 --> 6376.719
call them tartarian or whatever

6374.0 --> 6378.639
but like they're really big ones which

6376.719 --> 6380.96
there are a few in amsterdam

6378.639 --> 6382.32
i know maybe they have steam-powered

6380.96 --> 6387.6
heating too

6382.32 --> 6390.799999999999
maybe or they used to

6387.6 --> 6391.04
i don't know i'm not i'm not a hiss like

6390.8 --> 6393.6
a

6391.04 --> 6396.159
an architecture historian i don't know

6393.6 --> 6399.360000000001
all these things

6396.159 --> 6415.839999999999
i don't know everything about everything

6399.36 --> 6415.839999999999
everywhere okay

6425.44 --> 6429.44
we want you to well that's too bad i

6427.6 --> 6432.2390000000005
don't

6429.44 --> 6432.719
i don't know everything i might be able

6432.239 --> 6434.718999999999
to

6432.719 --> 6435.76
figure out everything but that doesn't

6434.719 --> 6438.56
mean that i just

6435.76 --> 6440.08
know everything it's just when you hand

6438.56 --> 6442.88
something over to me

6440.08 --> 6444.719
i'll probably make sense of it that's

6442.88 --> 6448.4800000000005
what i do i can make sense

6444.719 --> 6451.76
of everything most things

6448.48 --> 6452.48
not everything i'm very good at that but

6451.76 --> 6455.1990000000005
i don't

6452.48 --> 6457.839999999999
know everything a lot of information is

6455.199 --> 6457.839999999999
just raw

6462.0 --> 6466.08
okay well see you later matthew mitchell

6467.76 --> 6471.84
i know you're joking

6473.6 --> 6477.4400000000005
imagine the nasty massive sewer systems

6476.32 --> 6480.159
in the city

6477.44 --> 6481.839999999999
of the size of new york city well the

6480.159 --> 6485.119
i've already got a look at it

6481.84 --> 6486.400000000001
it's called ghostbusters 2. ever seen

6485.119 --> 6488.32
that

6486.4 --> 6490.0
they go down there oh yeah and by the

6488.32 --> 6493.36
way they accidentally break

6490.0 --> 6496.719
break the steam heating system i think

6493.36 --> 6500.4
it was electrical but yeah

6496.719 --> 6513.84
in that movie they literally reel down

6500.4 --> 6513.839999999999
and you get to see the sewers

6516.08 --> 6527.84
of course

6552.84 --> 6555.84
um

6566.84 --> 6569.84
hmm

6571.599 --> 6576.32
oh drop by the way i didn't do my

6574.639 --> 6578.719
newspaper rounds yesterday it's

6576.32 --> 6582.239
kind of late but i didn't do it i just

6578.719 --> 6586.2390000000005
didn't want to i'm really pissed off

6582.239 --> 6588.5599999999995
like i don't want to spread around news

6586.239 --> 6592.5599999999995
where people are having vaccines shoved

6588.56 --> 6592.56
in their face i've refused to do that

6593.599 --> 6597.84
this is like this is the last drop the

6595.92 --> 6598.2390000000005
next time if the next pa because they're

6597.84 --> 6600.159000000001
just

6598.239 --> 6602.08
they don't really care what i do whether

6600.159 --> 6604.4
i deliver it or not

6602.08 --> 6605.76
if next week there's going to be another

6604.4 --> 6607.92
[ __ ] headline with

6605.76 --> 6609.04
corona fixing this caron affecting that

6607.92 --> 6611.04
or we have to

6609.04 --> 6612.08
i'm literally just gonna email them like

6611.04 --> 6614.159
i'm i'm resting

6612.08 --> 6616.08
resigning i'm not gonna be part of this

6614.159 --> 6619.36
[ __ ]

6616.08 --> 6621.119
because i did this as a favor to people

6619.36 --> 6622.0
out there because i'm not making any

6621.119 --> 6624.0
money from it

6622.0 --> 6625.28
like two euros a month or something it's

6624.0 --> 6627.84
ridiculous

6625.28 --> 6628.8
doing it as a favor but i'm not going to

6627.84 --> 6631.4400000000005
help

6628.8 --> 6631.92
turn that favor into like yeah here's

6631.44 --> 6634.5599999999995
your

6631.92 --> 6639.84
death indoctrination i don't want to be

6634.56 --> 6639.84
part of that that's not why i did it

6649.36 --> 6654.799999999999
by the way i did get i noticed something

6652.48 --> 6659.759999999999
weird

6654.8 --> 6662.56
in a dutch alternative news site

6659.76 --> 6663.679
i don't know if it's even remotely true

6662.56 --> 6666.080000000001
or not

6663.679 --> 6667.84
or if this is some kind of conspiracy or

6666.08 --> 6671.119
whatever

6667.84 --> 6672.08
but there was this article about

6671.119 --> 6676.4
apparently

6672.08 --> 6676.4
that it is said

6676.639 --> 6682.639
that apparently friday

6679.679 --> 6684.639
the dutch cabinet is gonna fall like

6682.639 --> 6686.96
it's breaking

6684.639 --> 6688.88
because of also the vaccine [ __ ] and

6686.96 --> 6690.8
everything it's it's breaking apart so

6688.88 --> 6692.84
they say this i don't know if it's true

6690.8 --> 6694.4800000000005
or if this is like oh a fake out

6692.84 --> 6696.4800000000005
situation

6694.48 --> 6698.32
where everybody's gonna be oh finally

6696.48 --> 6700.718999999999
and then it's not gonna happen

6698.32 --> 6702.08
i don't know man because i don't trust

6700.719 --> 6704.4
it

6702.08 --> 6705.119
i don't trust these people anymore at

6704.4 --> 6708.48
all

6705.119 --> 6711.119
it could all be a giant fake out but

6708.48 --> 6714.32
i don't know maybe the government is

6711.119 --> 6717.5199999999995
going to go in some kind of a

6714.32 --> 6718.48
crisis very shortly here in the

6717.52 --> 6721.280000000001
netherlands

6718.48 --> 6722.0
if it will i'll be very interested and

6721.28 --> 6725.119
i'll probably

6722.0 --> 6727.599
report out a little on me on the super

6725.119 --> 6737.839999999999
super superficial level because i don't

6727.599 --> 6737.84
do deep digs in that sort of [ __ ]

6748.56 --> 6755.360000000001
huh really iron fe

6752.56 --> 6755.360000000001
that's bizarre

6757.28 --> 6762.5599999999995
well i i do understand though because

6759.119 --> 6765.44
hot showers can be very addictive

6762.56 --> 6767.280000000001
like when i was sick i was absolutely

6765.44 --> 6772.239
hot shower addicted

6767.28 --> 6774.08
because it helped but

6772.239 --> 6775.839999999999
now that i'm not sick anymore i don't

6774.08 --> 6778.88
shower constantly

6775.84 --> 6780.2390000000005
so i could do without what i do miss

6778.88 --> 6782.400000000001
however is just a hot

6780.239 --> 6784.5599999999995
the oppo yeah the possibility of taking

6782.4 --> 6786.4
a hot bath because that has just another

6784.56 --> 6789.92
level so it

6786.4 --> 6789.92
i haven't had one of those in

6791.199 --> 6798.638999999999
very long time very very long time

6795.199 --> 6801.839999999999
jesus christ [ __ ] seven years

6798.639 --> 6803.1990000000005
that's insane and i haven't had an

6801.84 --> 6807.84
actual warm bath in

6803.199 --> 6807.839999999999
seven years that's [ __ ] insane

6807.92 --> 6813.04
ah hey i kill the hope long time now see

6813.119 --> 6821.839999999999
come to omen for a bath dude nah

6823.679 --> 6827.119
but just showers are good enough for me

6826.719 --> 6830.96
and

6827.119 --> 6832.32
besides my my thing that i do is i wash

6830.96 --> 6834.56
my feet

6832.32 --> 6837.759999999999
every day before going to bed that's

6834.56 --> 6840.0
what i do that works really well

6837.76 --> 6842.0
and i don't take regular showers

6840.0 --> 6842.8
sometimes i take them now because i'm

6842.0 --> 6845.119
just cold

6842.8 --> 6846.719
when it's really cold it's an easy way

6845.119 --> 6850.159
to warm up quickly

6846.719 --> 6850.159
and i really do it for the heat

6851.119 --> 6854.48
but i don't shower regularly because

6852.8 --> 6857.4400000000005
it's not really that great for me it's

6854.48 --> 6857.44
not good for my skin

6858.4 --> 6863.839999999999
as far as i noticed

6870.96 --> 6877.84
without hot showers

6880.48 --> 6882.799999999999
hmm

6885.36 --> 6888.96
yeah steamy traveler hot springs in

6888.159 --> 6891.28
iceland

6888.96 --> 6892.32
hot springs what makes them so nice

6891.28 --> 6895.92
besides being hot

6892.32 --> 6897.44
is that they are saturated with minerals

6895.92 --> 6900.8
so you're getting like mineral

6897.44 --> 6904.32
bombardment when you go into that

6900.8 --> 6905.92
that's the real health benefit it's not

6904.32 --> 6908.08
just hot water no it's

6905.92 --> 6919.84
saturated with all kinds of minerals and

6908.08 --> 6919.84
all that

6931.76 --> 6936.56
all hmm so i'm gonna round out this wait

6934.08 --> 6936.5599999999995
what's that

6937.76 --> 6944.320000000001

saturated in giant juice what

6962.0 --> 6969.76
the [ __ ] oh hot mud baths are also good

6966.239 --> 6972.879999999999
yeah those are very good for the skin

6969.76 --> 6972.88
but then again just

6973.119 --> 6980.5599999999995
like uh mediterranean salt
