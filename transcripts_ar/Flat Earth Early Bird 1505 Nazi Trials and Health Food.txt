87.24 --> 93.979
right so today weather is amazing look

91.68 --> 96.119
at this it's a Pure Blue Sky

93.979 --> 98.28
all the way

96.119 --> 100.82
and I mean all the way I can't see a

98.28 --> 100.82000000000001
cloud around

100.979 --> 108.24
like almost sort of a bit hazy there but

105.96 --> 110.52
I mean the webcam is probably not even

108.24 --> 112.439
gonna pick that up distinctly

110.52 --> 115.259
I can barely make out the difference

112.439 --> 116.39899999999999
with my eyes it's just very pure blue

115.259 --> 118.799
sky

116.399 --> 123.06
bright Sun

118.799 --> 125.759
no wind that it's no wind at all I'm not

123.06 --> 129.979
seeing anything move not even on a small

125.759 --> 129.979
scale except for the birds flying around

130.08 --> 134.59900000000002
and yeah there's gardening work

132.06 --> 134.599
happening

135.06 --> 139.8
clearing out bushes for the springtime I

137.819 --> 144.14
think

139.8 --> 144.14000000000001
there's a plane flying over right there

146.16 --> 149.57999999999998
so

147.48 --> 152.94
it's that kind of the day very beautiful

149.58 --> 156.59900000000002
wind still enjoyable it's it's really

152.94 --> 159.84
nice in the sun I'm smoking some

156.599 --> 162.89999999999998
before this on the balcony

159.84 --> 165.18
really bright Sun

162.9 --> 167.239
like even with my eyes closed it's still

165.18 --> 170.81900000000002
kind of hurt a bit

167.239 --> 173.3
to my eyes it was that bright so it's a

170.819 --> 173.29999999999998
beautiful day

174.78 --> 183.78
it is Tuesday the 7th of February 2023

180.78 --> 183.78
foreign

190.58 --> 194.3
pretty good day yesterday

194.64 --> 197.83999999999997
was overall

198.239 --> 203.9
and the evening it became a little less

201.06 --> 203.9
but I mean

204.239 --> 210.48000000000002
it's a weird situation like

207.379 --> 211.92
the horn

210.48 --> 214.79999999999998
I was

211.92 --> 217.26
like tuning in there and was trying to

214.8 --> 219.54000000000002
figure out what he was talking about

217.26 --> 220.92
like it was really difficult for me to

219.54 --> 222.17999999999998
figure out like what he was talking

220.92 --> 225.23899999999998
about really

222.18 --> 228.54000000000002
but it seemed like he was trying to

225.239 --> 230.58
criticize some guy but I don't know that

228.54 --> 232.79899999999998
guy at all and he wasn't

230.58 --> 235.019
it was just all kind of confusing but I

232.799 --> 237.18
tried to communicate with somebody that

235.019 --> 242.34
apparently was a troll

237.18 --> 245.519
I had no idea because I just came in

242.34 --> 247.019
and then he banned me for that it's like

245.519 --> 250.4
what

247.019 --> 250.4
what you're talking to me

251.519 --> 255.98000000000002
what like it was so confusing

257.82 --> 262.699
right but he was not in a good mood

259.62 --> 262.699
during that

264.66 --> 268.86
I bet there's a whole bunch of trolls I

266.639 --> 271.38
would love to say oh now you know how it

268.86 --> 273.06
feels Arwin that's how we feel every

271.38 --> 277.04
time you ban us

273.06 --> 277.04
yeah but you

278.16 --> 285.66
well to be fair yeah it is comparable

282.06 --> 288.12
your but some of you probably aren't

285.66 --> 289.91900000000004
even trying to be [ __ ]

288.12 --> 291.84000000000003
you just are

289.919 --> 294.139
you can't help it you don't even see it

291.84 --> 294.13899999999995
probably

297.24 --> 303.05
but I mean you're here to nag

300.36 --> 304.91900000000004
I can instantly feel it

303.05 --> 306.78000000000003
[Music]

304.919 --> 308.4
I was there just kind of trying to have

306.78 --> 310.44
a conversation and I thought somebody

308.4 --> 311.63899999999995
was basically complaining about having

310.44 --> 315.12
an itch

311.639 --> 318.0
and I immediately thought like oh wait I

315.12 --> 320.6
have like advice for that just

318.0 --> 322.86
quit sugar and cut down on the coffee

320.6 --> 325.02000000000004
and so like yeah that sounded fine

322.86 --> 327.12
because I took it literally later only

325.02 --> 330.18
did I realized that that was probably a

327.12 --> 332.4
troll trying to psychosomatically nag

330.18 --> 334.62
the host or something

332.4 --> 336.06
like apparently he has a bit of issues

334.62 --> 338.88
with that

336.06 --> 342.84
which is very understandable I mean I

338.88 --> 345.78
have itch of or I've used to have

342.84 --> 350.29999999999995
that sort of issue overreaction

345.78 --> 350.29999999999995
to the chat it's not even that long ago

350.4 --> 356.34
but I mean

352.44 --> 360.62
he should know like hi I'm I just

356.34 --> 360.61999999999995
came along I have a channel

360.9 --> 366.06
I talk about this

363.539 --> 369.479
apparently he forgot or something

366.06 --> 371.759
I don't know it was weird

369.479 --> 374.75899999999996
makes me feel like there's not a lot of

371.759 --> 377.1
disability there at all

374.759 --> 380.58000000000004
I think the guy has issues

377.1 --> 383.16
but I mean who doesn't you know but

380.58 --> 384.71999999999997
still I mean there's not a lot I can do

383.16 --> 387.47900000000004
with that because

384.72 --> 390.12
I won't be able to just calmly be myself

387.479 --> 392.94
and do what I do

390.12 --> 395.22
without being misunderstood and

392.94 --> 398.88
like I'm attacking or something or like

395.22 --> 401.46000000000004
I'm trying to patronize somebody like no

398.88 --> 402.74
I'm literally trying to give advice you

401.46 --> 405.9
never know

402.74 --> 408.44
a lot of people don't know things or

405.9 --> 408.44
they forget

409.44 --> 415.16
anyway hello tarot 306 first and chat

412.5 --> 415.16
good to see you man

417.0 --> 422.759
so that was a bit weird

419.46 --> 425.12
and then I watched God forbid the Space

422.759 --> 425.12
movie

425.22 --> 430.86
which I kind of always avoid it for some

427.8 --> 434.479
reason because of the look of it

430.86 --> 437.58000000000004
and it's so funny because I

434.479 --> 438.979
it was exactly what I thought it was was

437.58 --> 440.52
gonna be

438.979 --> 442.74
exactly

440.52 --> 444.919
never seen it before not not even a

442.74 --> 444.919
trailer

445.8 --> 452.28000000000003
the movie in ways was very predictable

450.0 --> 455.4
but yeah it's called life it was a space

452.28 --> 456.9
movie in the issue of the future or

455.4 --> 459.65999999999997
something

456.9 --> 463.15999999999997
looking very different from the ISS we

459.66 --> 463.16
get to see from NASA

463.199 --> 469.979
and they were basically testing life

465.66 --> 473.09900000000005
from Mars they found something and then

469.979 --> 474.419
it all takes place just there it's all

473.099 --> 477.12
just one

474.419 --> 480.31899999999996
all in the ISS

477.12 --> 483.3
and then that yeah the life form

480.319 --> 485.03900000000004
gets kind of out of control and it's it

483.3 --> 487.199
basically very quickly started to remind

485.039 --> 490.44
me of The Blob

487.199 --> 492.90000000000003
which is like a movies of the 80s or 90s

490.44 --> 494.639
a horror movie where a meteor comes

492.9 --> 497.75899999999996
crashing down and literally like a

494.639 --> 499.979
jellyfish like thing is in there

497.759 --> 502.8
and it literally consumes like

499.979 --> 505.68
everything all living things

502.8 --> 508.319
including humans it's really horrific

505.68 --> 510.24
like scary like that's scary it's like

508.319 --> 512.52
all practical effects and it's really

510.24 --> 515.76
[ __ ] scary that that's movie scared

512.52 --> 520.159
the [ __ ] out of me when I was younger in

515.76 --> 520.159
my teens and they reminded me of that

520.919 --> 525.72
but it had just all that

524.12 --> 528.48
astronaut

525.72 --> 532.38
oh I'm gonna check herself sacrifice

528.48 --> 534.0600000000001
myself first for you guys [ __ ] it

532.38 --> 537.66
was like

534.06 --> 541.38
oh astronauts sacrificing themselves for

537.66 --> 544.5
the rest the movie that was literally it

541.38 --> 546.66
happened like way too many times it got

544.5 --> 549.56
on my nerves it was like this is getting

546.66 --> 549.56
[ __ ] annoying

550.74 --> 555.24
and

552.42 --> 559.3199999999999
if you constantly have people doing that

555.24 --> 561.36
they all do it when it's too late

559.32 --> 563.88
there was like this great opportunity

561.36 --> 566.04
for this woman

563.88 --> 567.959
I was gonna check something and then the

566.04 --> 571.5
creature

567.959 --> 573.8389999999999
comes out and whatever it's all it's

571.5 --> 576.36
pretty it's like a yeah

573.839 --> 580.62
like a stalker type movie but with an

576.36 --> 582.54
alien blob creature that's very fast and

580.62 --> 585.779
extremely intelligent

582.54 --> 588.0
and it's it I mean it is like

585.779 --> 590.3389999999999
well done in a way I thought the design

588.0 --> 594.74
of it was very

590.339 --> 599.2790000000001
Dynamic and natural looking like it was

594.74 --> 601.8
in that sense the CGI was pretty good

599.279 --> 603.72
is well developed

601.8 --> 605.64
the story though was just kind of

603.72 --> 607.26
annoying

605.64 --> 610.1999999999999
because there were several opportunities

607.26 --> 612.26
where there's like yeah oh you could ah

610.2 --> 615.08
the creatures on me

612.26 --> 618.899
I'm gonna try oh it's trying to drown me

615.08 --> 621.0600000000001
I'm gonna try to get back in oh wait no

618.899 --> 622.68
it's too late oh I'm just gonna stay

621.06 --> 626.279
outside and

622.68 --> 628.88
and die well why didn't you freaking

626.279 --> 633.959
figure that out before and then just

628.88 --> 635.9399999999999
like disconnect it jump off like push

633.959 --> 638.279
yourself off while that thing is still

635.94 --> 642.0
completely entangled with you so it

638.279 --> 643.4399999999999
can't jump back to the station you

642.0 --> 645.779
stupid

643.44 --> 648.3800000000001
she could have saved like half the crew

645.779 --> 648.38
doing that

649.56 --> 653.3389999999999
but no

651.3 --> 656.579
you're all dramatic in the last moment

653.339 --> 658.5
oh oh I tried to get you in no why are

656.579 --> 660.959
you working against me oh she's trying

658.5 --> 662.76
to sacrifice oh how freaking Brave of

660.959 --> 666.92
you yeah

662.76 --> 666.92
it's completely [ __ ] pointless

667.26 --> 672.8
I hated it in that sense anyway that

670.56 --> 672.8
movie

675.48 --> 678.32
foreign

680.6 --> 684.0790000000001
how it worked

684.12 --> 687.72
the special effects all of it was pretty

686.279 --> 690.779
good

687.72 --> 695.0
it's just that element was so overdone

690.779 --> 695.0
and it annoyed the [ __ ] out of me

697.32 --> 703.0790000000001
anyway hello

699.26 --> 705.0
what terminal Cola

703.079 --> 707.779
come to India

705.0 --> 707.779
okay

712.62 --> 715.85
[Music]

721.86 --> 724.5790000000001
all right

726.24 --> 730.44
and there's a lot of conferences stuff

728.82 --> 734.22
happening

730.44 --> 735.6
like in the Dutch alternative news that

734.22 --> 739.519
I like to follow

735.6 --> 739.519
there's been some messages too like

743.22 --> 747.4200000000001
for in in Japan apparently there's all

746.399 --> 751.079
kinds of

747.42 --> 754.4399999999999
trials happening right now

751.079 --> 757.579
in relation to vaccine damage

754.44 --> 757.5790000000001
this is a literal quote

760.74 --> 765.36
right

761.94 --> 768.0790000000001
so there's all there's stuff going down

765.36 --> 768.0790000000001
right now

768.72 --> 772.86
foreign

770.279 --> 775.079
like it's starting that's what I feel

772.86 --> 779.0
it's it's starting

775.079 --> 779.0
it's finally starting to happen

790.26 --> 795.66
yeah and good good and you I guess you

793.62 --> 798.899
could see it as similar

795.66 --> 802.079
people are finally snapping out of it on

798.899 --> 804.6
a very large scale like in group format

802.079 --> 806.88
and that is

804.6 --> 811.6800000000001
that hasn't really happened thus far

806.88 --> 815.16
that like media has been insanely

811.68 --> 818.6999999999999
strong in its effort to keep the mass

815.16 --> 822.36
like the the group Minds people that are

818.7 --> 825.36
like that out of that position

822.36 --> 827.88
to keep them strong behind them

825.36 --> 830.94
and that has apparently been faltering

827.88 --> 833.279
because now there are like big group

830.94 --> 835.86
Gatherings against them

833.279 --> 838.88
including in India apparently

835.86 --> 838.88
so that's good

839.579 --> 844.16
I'd say about damn time but I mean

845.579 --> 851.959
not everybody

846.899 --> 851.959
catches on 10 years before it happens

856.44 --> 863.22
or yeah I mean I was always extremely

859.68 --> 864.66
frightful of vaccinations even like in

863.22 --> 866.639
my teens

864.66 --> 869.459
I heard terrible stories about them

866.639 --> 872.279
which were real like I

869.459 --> 875.899
heard of people getting extremely

872.279 --> 875.899
vaccine damaged in school

876.0 --> 880.98
like from my school people there

878.76 --> 883.56
it's all just like

880.98 --> 887.82
and people well had their opinions even

883.56 --> 890.3389999999999
a sort of conspiracy opinion type

887.82 --> 893.1600000000001
and so I heard all that and yeah very

890.339 --> 895.399
influenceable so that made me already

893.16 --> 899.3389999999999
like yeah

895.399 --> 901.019
it's probably not as good as they say it

899.339 --> 902.639
is

901.019 --> 905.1
good

902.639 --> 907.88
so that happened a long time ago way

905.1 --> 907.88
before all this

908.22 --> 914.1
and they had Vision weird Vision

910.92 --> 916.4399999999999
announcements which like insisted on

914.1 --> 919.94
that I would take it

916.44 --> 919.94
which was surreal

920.76 --> 925.56
because why the hell would I do that but

923.519 --> 928.38
they like insisted within the vision

925.56 --> 930.06
which was horrifying to me because it

928.38 --> 931.68
was like an imminent Doom almost I

930.06 --> 933.0
didn't understand it like I didn't

931.68 --> 935.5999999999999
understand what the hell was going on

933.0 --> 935.6
anyway but

935.76 --> 940.26
he like insisted that I would take it

938.1 --> 942.9200000000001
throughout a big part of it but I

940.26 --> 942.92
haven't of course

945.959 --> 953.0999999999999
but in the vision I learned of all kinds

949.44 --> 955.2600000000001
like I heard descriptions of like what

953.1 --> 958.74
would happen how like

955.26 --> 961.74
it would be like a weird

958.74 --> 961.74
nano-organism

962.16 --> 968.16
like a tentacle monster that that those

965.639 --> 971.22
are the words

968.16 --> 973.74
that I heard described like they he was

971.22 --> 975.6
like sadistically described he I don't

973.74 --> 978.6
even know

975.6 --> 981.24
who if it was the guy through my dream

978.6 --> 983.639
or just a demon or something I don't

981.24 --> 985.5600000000001
know what it was although it carried his

983.639 --> 987.839
face

985.56 --> 989.699
in the but definitely in the vision was

987.839 --> 991.1990000000001
telling me

989.699 --> 994.68
like yeah

991.199 --> 997.4399999999999
we're expect we're gonna experiment on a

994.68 --> 1001.7589999999999
vast scale on everybody and

997.44 --> 1005.0600000000001
people are going to be tricked like be

1001.759 --> 1007.22
we're gonna try to create an organism

1005.06 --> 1011.68
in them like that's what

1007.22 --> 1011.6800000000001
I heard that in my vision in 97.

1012.199 --> 1016.54
at a later stage of that Vision though

1017.3 --> 1021.199
so

1018.74 --> 1023.0
and late yeah I mean 80 years is a

1021.199 --> 1024.559
freaking insane long time for our

1023.0 --> 1026.36
consciousness

1024.559 --> 1028.28
even though it literally happened in

1026.36 --> 1030.6789999999999
probably just one minute in physical

1028.28 --> 1033.6789999999999
time

1030.679 --> 1033.679
anyway

1036.679 --> 1044.0
was it tax tax damage guy

1040.76 --> 1045.5
right yeah but you can't say the word

1044.0 --> 1049.72
vax

1045.5 --> 1049.72
I've put that on the No No list

1055.64 --> 1059.9
but I mean

1057.2 --> 1063.14
I think it's okay to just reference

1059.9 --> 1066.3200000000002
vaccine damage from vaccines like in

1063.14 --> 1069.5590000000002
that happened 20 years ago because it

1066.32 --> 1071.8999999999999
was pretty rare

1069.559 --> 1075.98
all right back then

1071.9 --> 1079.4
but I mean that's all on record I mean

1075.98 --> 1081.5
I'm not oh making a direct connection oh

1079.4 --> 1084.0800000000002
I'm not right

1081.5 --> 1087.799
I'm not hyping the current

1084.08 --> 1090.559
position in the current thing

1087.799 --> 1094.28
so you can just reference that but yeah

1090.559 --> 1097.16
the word vax v a x is technically banned

1094.28 --> 1099.5
I just Auto ban it

1097.16 --> 1102.38
because I don't want people to yell out

1099.5 --> 1106.64
things about that in my chat

1102.38 --> 1107.73
never helps anyone and may give me risks

1106.64 --> 1111.98
and all that

1107.73 --> 1115.24
[Music]

1111.98 --> 1115.24
and I don't want that again

1115.53 --> 1122.0
[Music]

1118.46 --> 1125.6000000000001
besides what can even be said at this

1122.0 --> 1128.6
point in my chat concerning that subject

1125.6 --> 1130.9399999999998
that anybody getting to the point of

1128.6 --> 1132.9189999999999
actually finding my channel and

1130.94 --> 1135.44
following it hasn't already heard a

1132.919 --> 1136.64
thousand times concerning that one thing

1135.44 --> 1139.22
right

1136.64 --> 1141.6200000000001
there's no point

1139.22 --> 1144.98
[Music]

1141.62 --> 1147.3799999999999
in trying to Hype it up like that

1144.98 --> 1149.179
because it's it is everywhere and you're

1147.38 --> 1152.74
not even gonna find me unless you

1149.179 --> 1152.74
probably go through all that first

1165.08 --> 1167.62
oh

1177.2 --> 1179.6200000000001
right

1182.299 --> 1186.26
okay

1183.86 --> 1188.4189999999999
yeah by the way

1186.26 --> 1191.96
I hear and

1188.419 --> 1194.539
that there are basically

1191.96 --> 1196.72
treatments

1194.539 --> 1200.36
and like not

1196.72 --> 1202.539
invasive genetic editing type treatments

1200.36 --> 1202.539
even

1203.059 --> 1208.3999999999999
but I mean I don't know anything about

1205.039 --> 1210.5
them I just it heard some stuff from

1208.4 --> 1213.26
well from those doctors and all that

1210.5 --> 1215.539
that there are things

1213.26 --> 1218.12
that you can do to like

1215.539 --> 1221.66
get rid of the alleged Spike protein

1218.12 --> 1223.82
which I don't even know exactly like

1221.66 --> 1226.28
how much of that story is exactly real

1223.82 --> 1227.6
but it probably is an involvement of

1226.28 --> 1230.26
something

1227.6 --> 1230.26
like that

1231.02 --> 1236.799
but a lot of it that things that have

1232.94 --> 1236.799
been said about it I think are fake

1239.0 --> 1244.48
it's been overhyped I think but I mean

1242.26 --> 1246.98
apparently some people

1244.48 --> 1250.1
have something with that and there is

1246.98 --> 1253.1200000000001
something you can do about it

1250.1 --> 1253.12
to solve that

1253.28 --> 1259.72
anyway

1255.679 --> 1259.72
I haven't really looked too much into it

1265.12 --> 1271.82
no videos using those words get deleted

1270.2 --> 1273.26
okay

1271.82 --> 1275.5
well it's not much of the current thing

1273.26 --> 1275.5
anymore

1291.62 --> 1294.82
right but anyway

1295.88 --> 1302.1200000000001
I could talk about it I guess but I just

1299.539 --> 1304.52
I don't like

1302.12 --> 1308.8999999999999
there are chances that at some point

1304.52 --> 1312.559
they're gonna like re-do it like despite

1308.9 --> 1313.7
everything and then even at least on the

1312.559 --> 1318.1399999999999
short run

1313.7 --> 1321.14
they might send out the algorithm again

1318.14 --> 1323.0590000000002
right to clamp down so I almost like

1321.14 --> 1324.7990000000002
don't want to risk it until I basically

1323.059 --> 1329.059
see those people in jail and getting

1324.799 --> 1331.52
executed right because I'm like yeah

1329.059 --> 1334.52
these people are

1331.52 --> 1337.46
in ways tireless

1334.52 --> 1340.34
they don't give a [ __ ] it seems in how

1337.46 --> 1344.1200000000001
exposed they have become they just steep

1340.34 --> 1346.539
like stick to the plan this crazy ass

1344.12 --> 1346.539
plan

1346.76 --> 1350.72
just keep going keep going like that

1349.1 --> 1353.0
that's this thing that's the thing

1350.72 --> 1355.46
that's happening right A lot of people

1353.0 --> 1357.26
think oh well we've exposed them oh yeah

1355.46 --> 1358.4
now it's gonna stop finally Something's

1357.26 --> 1361.1589999999999
Gonna Be Done

1358.4 --> 1365.1200000000001
yeah it unfortunately doesn't really

1361.159 --> 1367.5200000000002
work like that anymore it used to like

1365.12 --> 1370.28
30 years ago

1367.52 --> 1374.539
even 20 years ago but

1370.28 --> 1378.94
things have changed quite dramatically

1374.539 --> 1384.94
in politics in last 10 years

1378.94 --> 1384.94
and they just keep doing it

1390.62 --> 1395.059
and apparently they have enough

1393.26 --> 1397.9
connections

1395.059 --> 1397.8999999999999
in places

1397.94 --> 1402.6200000000001
to not make sure that they don't get

1401.539 --> 1405.98
stopped

1402.62 --> 1408.6789999999999
which is completely insane that that's

1405.98 --> 1410.539
even possible I mean

1408.679 --> 1412.94
I've been wondering like what is all

1410.539 --> 1415.34
keeping this in its place

1412.94 --> 1419.48
and why aren't these people basically

1415.34 --> 1422.26
getting massively stalked and just

1419.48 --> 1422.26
I don't know

1422.6 --> 1429.58
like if you know which specific people

1425.36 --> 1429.58
keep this [ __ ] in place like it is

1430.64 --> 1435.98
it would be a miracle if those people

1432.559 --> 1438.86
have any kind of life right now

1435.98 --> 1441.799
without being terrified

1438.86 --> 1444.9799999999998
because they are literally like the

1441.799 --> 1447.98
pillars on like a sort of a new Nazi

1444.98 --> 1449.84
Empire right now like do you like you

1447.98 --> 1452.78
are the pillars there

1449.84 --> 1455.299
you're carrying it you're leaving your

1452.78 --> 1459.08
body exposed dude

1455.299 --> 1462.86
like the pillars are gonna eventually

1459.08 --> 1466.28
crumble when people figure that out

1462.86 --> 1468.1399999999999
because just attacking like what's on

1466.28 --> 1471.3999999999999
top of the pillars that that little

1468.14 --> 1474.7990000000002
pyramid thing that these politicians and

1471.4 --> 1476.5
media figures like yeah those people you

1474.799 --> 1480.1399999999999
can just go after them

1476.5 --> 1483.44
endlessly and they'll just complainy

1480.14 --> 1486.14
pants and gas like this [ __ ] out of

1483.44 --> 1488.179
everybody forever they will never stop

1486.14 --> 1489.2
they will just keep going and going and

1488.179 --> 1491.659
going

1489.2 --> 1493.94
I might get a bit more deranged but they

1491.659 --> 1496.7600000000002
will just keep going

1493.94 --> 1499.039
it's no use going after that at all like

1496.76 --> 1500.9
they it's like they want that

1499.039 --> 1503.539
they are the

1500.9 --> 1504.799
the gas lamp to attract the bugs at

1503.539 --> 1507.2
night

1504.799 --> 1509.059
that's what they are you need to go

1507.2 --> 1510.6200000000001
after the

1509.059 --> 1512.6
the

1510.62 --> 1515.4189999999999
what do you call it the

1512.6 --> 1520.299
the legs of the table

1515.419 --> 1520.2990000000002
it is standing on the pillars

1520.88 --> 1526.22
that's what okay is keeping this in

1523.22 --> 1531.32
place and those pillars should be

1526.22 --> 1531.32
like highlighted identified

1532.7 --> 1537.679
made known basically public oh no my

1536.12 --> 1541.9599999999998
private information yeah go [ __ ]

1537.679 --> 1541.96
yourself you're a [ __ ] Nazi bastard

1542.02 --> 1547.6399999999999
no what do you think only the system can

1544.94 --> 1550.039
do that sort of [ __ ] no people can do

1547.64 --> 1553.22
that too it's just that normal people

1550.039 --> 1556.76
that aren't freaking Nazis have a

1553.22 --> 1558.74
conscious and they don't think that it's

1556.76 --> 1561.32
something you should normally do to

1558.74 --> 1563.26
people just because they oppose you but

1561.32 --> 1566.779
since you're a freaking

1563.26 --> 1570.14
obvious Nazi upholding

1566.779 --> 1573.26
like terrible Eugenics power in this

1570.14 --> 1576.64
country well yeah that kind of changes

1573.26 --> 1576.64
things now doesn't it

1587.299 --> 1594.46
right bad things what the hell

1591.44 --> 1594.46
was talking about that

1600.98 --> 1603.64
bro

1604.1 --> 1608.4189999999999
well maybe in your country tarot maybe

1606.62 --> 1610.8799999999999
that's the way you guys do it over there

1608.419 --> 1612.74
in here we will be lucky if they even

1610.88 --> 1616.659
get a death penalty

1612.74 --> 1616.659
because we're freaking wussies

1617.96 --> 1623.26
if it were up to me I'd probably just

1620.84 --> 1623.26
like

1625.88 --> 1631.64
since all of the guys since all these

1628.52 --> 1634.039
same people are all it's all the same

1631.64 --> 1635.8400000000001
scam right

1634.039 --> 1639.44
like the

1635.84 --> 1642.3799999999999
medical experimentation

1639.44 --> 1645.5800000000002
and the Russia War

1642.38 --> 1650.24
that's the same people they are not

1645.58 --> 1652.3999999999999
separate in any way so a good tactic to

1650.24 --> 1653.9
get rid of them for the Dutch sheets

1652.4 --> 1656.419
which have no death penalty

1653.9 --> 1658.94
unfortunately which is very stupid it

1656.419 --> 1661.159
should definitely exist specifically for

1658.94 --> 1662.659
these types of scenarios

1661.159 --> 1664.88
for like

1662.659 --> 1667.0590000000002
well

1664.88 --> 1667.0590000000002
foreign

1667.539 --> 1674.44
multiple casualty scenarios

1671.96 --> 1674.44
right

1675.74 --> 1681.44
should be there

1678.26 --> 1685.1589999999999
capital punishment I believe

1681.44 --> 1688.1000000000001
not just like oh like

1685.159 --> 1691.4
it should be very rare

1688.1 --> 1694.3999999999999
not just used in regular crimes although

1691.4 --> 1696.98
yeah I mean somebody's like continually

1694.4 --> 1699.26
just murdering after murder that's

1696.98 --> 1701.419
would also eventually yeah I don't know

1699.26 --> 1703.34
it's just my opinion the duchies

1701.419 --> 1705.3200000000002
probably are not gonna do it but we

1703.34 --> 1708.08
could just like okay

1705.32 --> 1711.74
well I bet Russia's gonna have a very

1708.08 --> 1713.6589999999999
interesting War Court after that shit's

1711.74 --> 1715.039
over there

1713.659 --> 1716.419
we could just

1715.039 --> 1719.299
hey Russia

1716.419 --> 1722.3600000000001
you want these people that that

1719.299 --> 1726.2
literally stole our money

1722.36 --> 1728.3799999999999
and send weapons to Ukraine you want

1726.2 --> 1728.38
them

1728.48 --> 1733.159
you can have them

1730.4 --> 1738.0800000000002
I mean in with us so they would just

1733.159 --> 1739.22
take up like tax tax Euros in jails and

1738.08 --> 1740.4189999999999
[ __ ]

1739.22 --> 1743.48
so

1740.419 --> 1746.26
maybe you could deal with them in a more

1743.48 --> 1746.26
efficient way

1749.23 --> 1752.45
[Music]

1753.159 --> 1758.6000000000001
right and then hopefully they won't like

1756.2 --> 1760.5800000000002
get pardoned and [ __ ] because that would

1758.6 --> 1763.279
be a major shock

1760.58 --> 1766.24
my Russian but anyway like yeah I've

1763.279 --> 1766.24
been thinking about that

1767.36 --> 1772.34
because

1768.98 --> 1774.559
I really like there have to be

1772.34 --> 1777.5
deaths

1774.559 --> 1781.6399999999999
and if in some way possible legally

1777.5 --> 1785.74
because there has to be a sign like you

1781.64 --> 1785.74
can't [ __ ] do this anymore

1785.779 --> 1793.36
because I believe if we don't

1789.2 --> 1793.3600000000001
they'll just keep going

1793.64 --> 1801.919
and like you cut off the mushroom

1796.94 --> 1804.38
well the fungus is still in the bark

1801.919 --> 1806.96
it's just gonna grow a new mushroom so

1804.38 --> 1810.38
you have to like

1806.96 --> 1814.779
basically put an anti-fungal on the bar

1810.38 --> 1814.779
yet yeah you have to actually kill it

1814.94 --> 1818.659
not just

1816.26 --> 1821.179
cut off the flower of it

1818.659 --> 1823.8200000000002
if you want to get rid of the fungus

1821.179 --> 1825.679
they want to save the tree

1823.82 --> 1828.3799999999999
I don't know by the way this is

1825.679 --> 1830.539
improvised don't know about forestry how

1828.38 --> 1832.7600000000002
that actually works if you even can do

1830.539 --> 1835.34
that I've seen a lot of trees which that

1832.76 --> 1837.26
get like mushrooms on them on the bark

1835.34 --> 1839.779
and they just get cut down because

1837.26 --> 1842.299
apparently they

1839.779 --> 1846.44
they don't save them or that's not

1842.299 --> 1848.84
possible but I mean in theory you might

1846.44 --> 1850.46
just give a tree anti-fungal or

1848.84 --> 1853.1
something

1850.46 --> 1855.44
but it could also damage the ground so

1853.1 --> 1857.4189999999999
maybe it's like when mushrooms start

1855.44 --> 1859.94
popping up out of a tree it's like too

1857.419 --> 1861.8600000000001
late I'm not sure

1859.94 --> 1864.44
I'm not a Forester

1861.86 --> 1866.899
maybe I should I could ask arakil the

1864.44 --> 1870.8200000000002
hope if he ever pops up again

1866.899 --> 1870.82
because he is into Forestry

1874.36 --> 1880.8799999999999
is that the right word for it Forestry

1878.419 --> 1883.419
it's like

1880.88 --> 1883.419
uh

1884.15 --> 1889.1000000000001
[Music]

1886.58 --> 1891.5
currently ending plan because yeah yeah

1889.1 --> 1894.039
it is forestry I had the word right

1891.5 --> 1894.039
thank God

1894.14 --> 1897.46
still good to check

1899.56 --> 1902.599
[Music]

1924.5 --> 1930.279
and continually [ __ ] the public uh well

1927.74 --> 1930.279
tered

1931.58 --> 1937.1
I mean screwing with the public isn't

1935.0 --> 1940.34
necessarily even the issue that's just

1937.1 --> 1943.76
misfunctional it's that they are

1940.34 --> 1945.32
they have goals to literally destroy

1943.76 --> 1947.419
nations with it

1945.32 --> 1949.34
like they want to destroy the cohesion

1947.419 --> 1952.3400000000001
they want to destroy

1949.34 --> 1956.12
the strength of the people itself

1952.34 --> 1958.52
and like even genetically

1956.12 --> 1961.399
so

1958.52 --> 1966.7
that's why it's so egregious and that's

1961.399 --> 1969.7399999999998
why it needs such a brutal punishment

1966.7 --> 1974.44
specifically because of that that

1969.74 --> 1974.44
attitude like you just can't have that

1985.399 --> 1990.559
and it's ridiculous because a lot of

1987.799 --> 1993.559
people in this country especially were

1990.559 --> 1996.559
very aware of that sort of mindset then

1993.559 --> 1999.74
again in these days there are still like

1996.559 --> 2001.779
a lot of dutchies here

1999.74 --> 2003.7
that are really figuring it out like

2001.779 --> 2006.159
even the media people they are like

2003.7 --> 2008.46
Reawakening they are realizing like oh

2006.159 --> 2008.46
[ __ ]

2008.679 --> 2015.64
it's happened again

2011.88 --> 2017.019
I'd never thought I'd see it like like

2015.64 --> 2020.2
it is

2017.019 --> 2022.48
this is exactly the [ __ ] that 20 years

2020.2 --> 2024.22
ago people were trying to prevent and

2022.48 --> 2026.08
it's actually happening

2024.22 --> 2028.679
it's happened

2026.08 --> 2028.6789999999999
so

2030.039 --> 2034.12
yeah it's crazy anyway

2034.779 --> 2037.679
foreign

2038.76 --> 2043.019
s it's been a while

2058.54 --> 2065.22
tough and immediate punishments in Arab

2061.119 --> 2065.2200000000003
yeah well a lot of them

2066.639 --> 2069.179
foreign

2081.54 --> 2086.08
I'm gonna remove that is too far man

2084.339 --> 2090.159
don't

2086.08 --> 2093.639
that is too far don't do that

2090.159 --> 2095.679
could you please remove that

2093.639 --> 2098.92
I don't want that kind of

2095.679 --> 2101.92
thing in my chat I can't

2098.92 --> 2101.92
help

2102.94 --> 2106.2000000000003
how is this YouTube

2106.48 --> 2113.859
turret thank you why oh he has a wrench

2110.8 --> 2117.579
so I can't remove his message

2113.859 --> 2120.88
as the channel on what the [ __ ] is this

2117.579 --> 2123.3390000000004
that's a terrible system what just

2120.88 --> 2125.56
because somebody with a wrench sends

2123.339 --> 2127.72
something it cannot be removed except by

2125.56 --> 2129.66
them or through a timeout which then

2127.72 --> 2132.16
removes everything

2129.66 --> 2134.94
ridiculous system

2132.16 --> 2134.94
hold on

2161.94 --> 2168.54
yeah it might be a package for me

2165.22 --> 2168.54
might be the book even

2180.0 --> 2184.9
or something else I don't know could be

2183.16 --> 2189.359
even it

2184.9 --> 2189.359
surprise birthday present or something

2197.0 --> 2199.2
[Music]

2197.2 --> 2199.2
um

2200.64 --> 2204.0
okay thanks

2233.56 --> 2236.339
welcome

2246.579 --> 2251.26
back

2248.11 --> 2251.26
[Music]

2254.859 --> 2258.339
yeah

2256.119 --> 2261.7200000000003
this is it's very interesting I'm gonna

2258.339 --> 2261.72
have a little unpacking video

2267.22 --> 2272.6189999999997
yeah I was trying to find

2270.16 --> 2275.3199999999997
black Crystal again

2272.619 --> 2277.2400000000002
in albertang and it wasn't there still

2275.32 --> 2279.579
and then I tried another albertang

2277.24 --> 2281.3799999999997
wasn't there either

2279.579 --> 2284.5
so then I thought

2281.38 --> 2287.6800000000003
maybe I could just order it online

2284.5 --> 2290.88
and I did and it was like really cheap

2287.68 --> 2290.8799999999997
compared to in the store

2290.92 --> 2295.98
so I got like well a lot

2298.06 --> 2300.06
um

2304.06 --> 2306.2999999999997
foreign

2308.78 --> 2311.8590000000004
[Music]

2314.21 --> 2321.04
[Laughter]

2316.8 --> 2324.119
so yeah I probably have enough light for

2321.04 --> 2324.119
the rest of the year now

2330.839 --> 2336.64
so that's pretty cool

2333.88 --> 2338.98
like 40 rolls of them

2336.64 --> 2340.96
I'm gonna have to figure out though how

2338.98 --> 2344.46
to store them

2340.96 --> 2344.46
without them getting wet

2351.46 --> 2355.7200000000003
but it is kind of an I think that it

2353.92 --> 2357.76
might be

2355.72 --> 2358.68
I don't know they might be like on a

2357.76 --> 2361.48
weird

2358.68 --> 2363.3999999999996
put it in the background list because I

2361.48 --> 2367.44
don't see them around anymore like this

2363.4 --> 2367.44
all it's really disappointing actually

2368.8 --> 2374.44
like in like tip like in a tobacco store

2372.22 --> 2377.4399999999996
where they have like little candy things

2374.44 --> 2379.359
sometimes don't see it there

2377.44 --> 2381.94
I don't see it

2379.359 --> 2383.14
well in the big supermarkets is where I

2381.94 --> 2385.96
could find it

2383.14 --> 2387.339
so I hope they're not like going Bust or

2385.96 --> 2391.119
anything or

2387.339 --> 2396.119
because I love that product

2391.119 --> 2396.119
it's like it's basically the only candy

2397.119 --> 2403.56
that I even still take

2400.119 --> 2403.56
anyway hello LSG

2410.48 --> 2413.559
[Music]

2422.5 --> 2430.0
oh God good yeah let her say ah

2428.079 --> 2432.76
so gross

2430.0 --> 2434.8
why are you oh

2432.76 --> 2437.44
getting all descriptive about that

2434.8 --> 2439.2400000000002
that's [ __ ] up man shouldn't do that

2437.44 --> 2442.0
it's not good

2439.24 --> 2445.5989999999997
like why do you think I avoid doing that

2442.0 --> 2448.42
because it's not good it's not good to

2445.599 --> 2450.7000000000003
say those things like even if it is a

2448.42 --> 2452.859
deserve it it's never good to say those

2450.7 --> 2456.04
things it's like talking the language of

2452.859 --> 2458.74
Mordor I mean it

2456.04 --> 2461.8
doesn't matter how much somebody seems

2458.74 --> 2466.2999999999997
to deserve it it's never good to start

2461.8 --> 2468.88
describing those things like that's evil

2466.3 --> 2471.46
there's no scenario in which that it

2468.88 --> 2473.94
could be good

2471.46 --> 2473.94
uh

2474.76 --> 2477.3
anyway

2477.339 --> 2482.7999999999997
and yeah I mean

2481.3 --> 2486.46
quick

2482.8 --> 2489.3390000000004
I don't know about that like

2486.46 --> 2492.339
it has to be figured out

2489.339 --> 2492.339
but

2493.599 --> 2499.3590000000004
I've already tried to even

2496.2 --> 2501.46
warn everybody when I get into that sort

2499.359 --> 2504.06
of Vengeance thought and all that which

2501.46 --> 2504.06
is not good

2504.42 --> 2510.4
if it ever comes to pass to actually

2507.64 --> 2513.339
happen then it's never going to feel

2510.4 --> 2516.28
actually like it is now when you're like

2513.339 --> 2517.839
longing for it to end it will be very

2516.28 --> 2520.8
different

2517.839 --> 2520.7999999999997
always is

2522.4 --> 2529.54
so it's better to not dwell upon those

2525.579 --> 2533.579
types of ideas trying to create that

2529.54 --> 2533.579
in your mind about the future

2539.859 --> 2545.3199999999997
but yeah I mean

2542.099 --> 2547.96
that's why I don't I'm like oh this or

2545.32 --> 2551.98
this is the way or that's the way I mean

2547.96 --> 2554.079
unless I'm really freaking pissed off

2551.98 --> 2556.06
and then I might like get really dark

2554.079 --> 2559.3590000000004
with it

2556.06 --> 2562.9
but it's only when I'm really like get

2559.359 --> 2566.0789999999997
that rage energy and rage win

2562.9 --> 2567.52
but overall it's really pragmatic why I

2566.079 --> 2570.04
think that they

2567.52 --> 2572.98
like some of these people that are

2570.04 --> 2577.119
organizing all this should be executed

2572.98 --> 2579.339
it is really for pragmatic purposes

2577.119 --> 2580.96
because it's got to stop

2579.339 --> 2583.2999999999997
like they're

2580.96 --> 2586.56
I don't think there's like they you have

2583.3 --> 2586.5600000000004
to do that to make him stop

2595.5 --> 2601.42
all right you gotta also realize it's

2598.359 --> 2604.18
it's yeah with a lot of these psycho

2601.42 --> 2608.099
conspirators it's not just them right

2604.18 --> 2610.7799999999997
they have their family involved

2608.099 --> 2612.28
so even if they're just going to be in

2610.78 --> 2616.7200000000003
jail

2612.28 --> 2618.28
what the family members are not also

2616.72 --> 2621.16
going to be in jail well guess what

2618.28 --> 2623.3190000000004
they're gonna do they're just going to

2621.16 --> 2627.3999999999996
continue that [ __ ]

2623.319 --> 2629.859
or if like Daddy Gates or Whatever Gets

2627.4 --> 2632.2000000000003
executed could you imagine it's probably

2629.859 --> 2633.52
not gonna happen for a long time

2632.2 --> 2635.859
then

2633.52 --> 2639.28
they're just gonna

2635.859 --> 2643.5989999999997
yeah not so eagerly pick up those reins

2639.28 --> 2647.3390000000004
again right because data want to die

2643.599 --> 2647.339
whoa whoa

2648.339 --> 2650.94
right

2653.8 --> 2656.3390000000004
anyway

2656.52 --> 2663.22
let's try to

2659.56 --> 2665.5
shift subjects to something uh a little

2663.22 --> 2667.859
bit more constructive and positive if

2665.5 --> 2667.859
possible

2667.9 --> 2670.619
uh

2676.599 --> 2678.78
thank you

2695.099 --> 2701.079
okay Jared I'm trying to read up on what

2698.26 --> 2704.5200000000004
you guys have been saying

2701.079 --> 2708.46
all right so there are

2704.52 --> 2711.06
not even that rough in India with the

2708.46 --> 2711.06
death penalty

2712.18 --> 2716.44
yeah it's probably

2714.88 --> 2718.3
but I mean

2716.44 --> 2722.8
India has been

2718.3 --> 2726.0
pretty severely infected with sjw [ __ ]

2722.8 --> 2726.0
hasn't it Tarot

2729.0 --> 2734.14
like that is also there

2732.04 --> 2738.4
just like in the West

2734.14 --> 2740.74
and they are always like sjw is freaking

2738.4 --> 2745.119
worship criminals effectively

2740.74 --> 2747.22
the actual criminals the ones that are

2745.119 --> 2750.099
still with them and they're stupid

2747.22 --> 2752.2
useless ideology though

2750.099 --> 2753.7000000000003
but then like oh they murdered a bunch

2752.2 --> 2755.68
of people they don't give a [ __ ] because

2753.7 --> 2757.96
they're on their side

2755.68 --> 2758.819
so that's what they typically do they

2757.96 --> 2762.94
just

2758.819 --> 2766.68
sjws just try to prevent homicidal

2762.94 --> 2766.68
Maniacs from getting killed

2767.04 --> 2771.359
and that just makes everything worse

2774.7 --> 2777.8999999999996
India said

2779.92 --> 2783.839
hey Matthew Hall let's see you

2787.0 --> 2790.9
man time is flying

2788.98 --> 2795.0
I can't believe it

2790.9 --> 2795.0
such beautiful weather it's amazing

2799.54 --> 2804.66
and I feel great

2802.06 --> 2804.66
foreign

2810.119 --> 2817.7200000000003
no alcohol no [ __ ] with that I gotta cut

2820.48 --> 2824.2
noticing

but that's great it's just like oh

2824.2 --> 2829.4199999999996
cutting down oh no how terrible that

2827.079 --> 2832.0

2920.38 --> 2923.04
really

2931.18 --> 2934.0789999999997
anyways

2954.4 --> 2959.619
what's the temperature here yeah

2957.119 --> 2962.46
did I check that

2959.619 --> 2962.46
maybe I forgot

2962.5 --> 2967.18
five degrees Celsius so it is a little

2965.079 --> 2969.76
cooler apparently

2967.18 --> 2972.0989999999997
or the weather readout's just complete

2969.76 --> 2975.4
horseshit that's a possibility too

2972.099 --> 2977.98
yesterday is us it was raining no it

2975.4 --> 2981.839
wasn't at all

2977.98 --> 2981.839
so that was just complete nonsense

2982.3 --> 2987.2200000000003
it is freezing a bit at night I did also

2985.3 --> 2989.44
see some Frost

2987.22 --> 2992.4399999999996
in the shadows

2989.44 --> 2994.3
earlier but that's all gone now so it is

2992.44 --> 2996.339
kind of freezing at night but I know

2994.3 --> 2998.319
with the sun it's beautiful but then as

2996.339 --> 2999.46
soon as the sun goes down it does get

2998.319 --> 3003.079
really

2999.46 --> 3003.079
called very quickly

3007.8 --> 3010.52

3014.66 --> 3018.98
Poncho Pete is he still around

3022.14 --> 3026.5789999999997
huh

3024.42 --> 3029.099
okay

3026.579 --> 3032.04
yeah now punch your feet I we kind of

3029.099 --> 3034.56
hang I we had a couple of shows or yet

3032.04 --> 3037.02
shows where everybody could just roll in

3034.56 --> 3041.0
and I joined some of them

3037.02 --> 3041.0
but that guy's freaking insane

3042.42 --> 3048.3
he has like

3044.94 --> 3051.98
really bizarre emotional issues and gets

3048.3 --> 3051.98
like kind of psychotic at times

3053.34 --> 3056.4590000000003
[Music]

3057.319 --> 3063.0589999999997
he's had some trauma I think he's even

3060.119 --> 3066.359
like talked about that a bit in the past

3063.059 --> 3068.6600000000003
but I don't know I in many ways is bad

3066.359 --> 3068.66
news

3069.059 --> 3072.92
there's something creepy about him

3074.579 --> 3079.3390000000004
he's acted like weird and satanic at

3077.16 --> 3079.339
times

3080.16 --> 3084.1189999999997
so I don't see him as a really stable

3082.68 --> 3088.859
person

3084.119 --> 3091.02
but it was kind of fun hanging around

3088.859 --> 3093.72
for a while

3091.02 --> 3097.619
but eventually he also became like very

3093.72 --> 3100.2599999999998
Savage and just everybody's a shield

3097.619 --> 3102.78
and that was really lame

3100.26 --> 3105.3
that's when I completely like lost

3102.78 --> 3106.5
interest and just stopped hanging around

3105.3 --> 3109.02
them

3106.5 --> 3112.4
because he was like more on the side of

3109.02 --> 3115.64
Antonio super rats and crowd

3112.4 --> 3115.64
Antonio's dead

3116.94 --> 3120.839
I don't know who they hang around with

3118.68 --> 3123.14
nowadays but apparently he's just gaming

and besides that's not always true

foreign

3503.4 --> 3509.04
if you haven't actually attained that

3506.52 --> 3511.4
already is not just certainly all gonna

3509.04 --> 3511.4
happen

3511.7 --> 3517.2599999999998
it's usually if you have already built

3514.74 --> 3519.72
up a couple of aches and pains and then

3517.26 --> 3522.5400000000004
those tend to get worse that's usually

3519.72 --> 3523.799
what happens you don't just subtly out

3522.54 --> 3526.619
of nowhere

3523.799 --> 3529.619
start to develop that

3526.619 --> 3532.88
unless you're like a working man

3529.619 --> 3532.88
then it might happen

3538.74 --> 3545.3999999999996
only joking you're talking to a lady

3541.98 --> 3548.78
that's that's terrible terrible joke Ian

3588.72 --> 3595.2799999999997
I wish I could say the same things

3592.44 --> 3595.28
uh-huh

3597.119 --> 3603.599
although I've lost a lot of them

3600.839 --> 3606.24
I'm actually like

3603.599 --> 3609.98
less burdened by issues

3606.24 --> 3609.9799999999996
and then I was 20 years ago

3616.619 --> 3620.96
yeah good and you or another one we'll

3618.42 --> 3620.96
keep it that way

3632.75 --> 3635.8
[Music]

3636.599 --> 3639.559
okay

3640.76 --> 3645.9
no but I actually believe it's the other

3643.5 --> 3648.0
way around I mean

3645.9 --> 3649.7400000000002
those types of things is like oh you're

3648.0 --> 3652.5
getting old that means you're gonna get

3649.74 --> 3654.0589999999997
sick and and like get issues and you

3652.5 --> 3656.94
can't do any more things anymore

3654.059 --> 3658.7400000000002
crippled or you become demented like

3656.94 --> 3661.92
really

3658.74 --> 3666.18
that always happens does it

3661.92 --> 3668.46
or does it just happen to people that

3666.18 --> 3671.04
don't figure it out

3668.46 --> 3673.799
when they get old like they have to

3671.04 --> 3676.46
completely rearrange everything and

3673.799 --> 3678.96
that they actually have to like train

3676.46 --> 3683.0
things and

3678.96 --> 3683.0
so they just let it kind of snuff out

3685.26 --> 3689.88
because they don't grow into the format

3688.079 --> 3691.6800000000003
of actually maintaining yourself when

3689.88 --> 3696.0
you get older and

3691.68 --> 3698.16
yeah that when you give up right

3696.0 --> 3700.26
a lot of people then get kind of sick

3698.16 --> 3702.299
and die that's even why some people that

3700.26 --> 3704.5400000000004
are really into their job when they then

3702.299 --> 3709.339
suddenly quit that job

3704.54 --> 3709.339
they they get a heart attack and die

3714.48 --> 3717.02
it's weird

3717.359 --> 3724.52
but it's all about the mindset as like

3719.7 --> 3724.52
are you preparing for an old age

3724.559 --> 3729.5400000000004
then like how well do you know your body

3726.839 --> 3732.48
how well can you prevent damage on your

3729.54 --> 3735.48
body especially when you're younger

3732.48 --> 3738.9
but if you can't then how do you deal

3735.48 --> 3741.599
with it it's like it's a giant plan of

3738.9 --> 3743.839
it's a life plan everybody should have

3741.599 --> 3743.839
one

3744.0 --> 3748.02
but

3745.859 --> 3750.96
you kind of have to be

3748.02 --> 3753.24
have it pointed out to you at a

3750.96 --> 3754.02
relatively young age that that is a

3753.24 --> 3756.0589999999997
thing

3754.02 --> 3758.64
in order for you to get good at it

3756.059 --> 3760.6800000000003
because if you like oh start doing that

3758.64 --> 3762.5989999999997
way later in life

3760.68 --> 3764.7599999999998
well then you already [ __ ] up so many

3762.599 --> 3766.6800000000003
things you you haven't even kept track

3764.76 --> 3768.96
properly probably of what what's

3766.68 --> 3770.7
happened in your life so how are you

3768.96 --> 3772.26
going to manage your health then if you

3770.7 --> 3774.299
don't even know what you've taken and

3772.26 --> 3776.88
all that [ __ ] right if you've gone so

3774.299 --> 3778.799
loose on a party you've ingested things

3776.88 --> 3780.78
you don't even know what it was

3778.799 --> 3783.359
like how are you going to take care of

3780.78 --> 3784.92
your long-term Health like that

3783.359 --> 3788.0
later

3784.92 --> 3788.0
but anyway

3791.339 --> 3795.54
but the thing is is if you get wiser

3793.98 --> 3797.4
when you get older you don't just give

3795.54 --> 3800.52
up

3797.4 --> 3802.92
then you may actually become healthier

3800.52 --> 3805.559
and less burdened

3802.92 --> 3807.359
by physical issues later in life than

3805.559 --> 3809.7000000000003
when you were younger

3807.359 --> 3811.2599999999998
because when you're younger you get rash

3809.7 --> 3813.7799999999997
you [ __ ] up

3811.26 --> 3816.42
you do damage you try things out and it

3813.78 --> 3819.119
turned out not to be great foreign

3816.42 --> 3822.2400000000002
and you get all kinds of weird effects

3819.119 --> 3824.46
that burden you

3822.24 --> 3826.68
well when your later life you'd probably

3824.46 --> 3830.48
just don't do that anymore you're less

3826.68 --> 3830.48
impulsive like that

3830.88 --> 3836.88
and more careful more good at being

3834.42 --> 3838.6800000000003
careful

3836.88 --> 3839.7000000000003
or you're just a complete failure at

3838.68 --> 3841.0789999999997
life

3839.7 --> 3845.66
and then

3841.079 --> 3845.6600000000003
you can literally have less issues

3846.299 --> 3849.799
less issues with life

3850.5 --> 3854.76
right so there's basically two

3852.48 --> 3858.66
directions older people can take and one

3854.76 --> 3860.94
is you degenerate and then die and the

3858.66 --> 3863.22
other is you actually become better at

3860.94 --> 3866.42
life than you were

3863.22 --> 3869.72
and you live a healthy peaceful

3866.42 --> 3869.7200000000003
clear-minded life

3871.74 --> 3876.68
with like social function and all that

3877.859 --> 3882.72
then you probably could be you'll be

3879.9 --> 3884.88
more respected then too right those are

3882.72 --> 3888.72
the directions you can take

3884.88 --> 3891.96
and even acceptance by Society is not

3888.72 --> 3895.3799999999997
essential in that decision

3891.96 --> 3898.2
because I definitely made the decision

3895.38 --> 3901.88
for the for the second to not crumble

3898.2 --> 3905.22
very early on but I never really

3901.88 --> 3907.44
connected up with society that much

3905.22 --> 3909.7799999999997
so it's independent from that's just

3907.44 --> 3912.059
because you get rejected by everybody in

3909.78 --> 3914.52
your family or something or that doesn't

3912.059 --> 3917.099
mean you then have no choice but to

3914.52 --> 3920.22
degenerate and die

3917.099 --> 3921.96
even though if it's really rough some

3920.22 --> 3924.7799999999997
people might literally try to project

3921.96 --> 3925.859
that onto you and make you believe that

3924.78 --> 3930.02
yeah

3925.859 --> 3930.02
which has actually happened in my life

3930.18 --> 3935.96
and I love some

3932.64 --> 3935.96
pretty bad scars

3940.5 --> 3946.319
but I've fought my way through that

3943.859 --> 3948.96
and to dispel that to dispel that belief

3946.319 --> 3951.66
that I did believe

3948.96 --> 3954.78
for some time

3951.66 --> 3958.2599999999998
like I'm gonna end up terrible

3954.78 --> 3960.0
everybody's gonna hate me I'm an outcast

3958.26 --> 3962.6400000000003
nobody's gonna care what I have to say

3960.0 --> 3964.559
people are like not going to listen to

3962.64 --> 3967.02
me even though I'm trying to help them

3964.559 --> 3969.7400000000002
with really good advice just because

3967.02 --> 3969.74
it's me

3970.02 --> 3974.24
that was like the fear image

3975.18 --> 3979.319
that people basically placed inside of

3978.48 --> 3982.319
me

3979.319 --> 3984.7799999999997
to make me tone down make me Shut up

3982.319 --> 3985.859
make me stop saying things that blew

3984.78 --> 3989.119
their minds

3985.859 --> 3989.119
because they didn't want that

4000.079 --> 4005.0
right so yeah people can be convinced

4002.48 --> 4007.88
into believing when you grow older

4005.0 --> 4010.88
you're gonna get sick and it'll hurt

4007.88 --> 4013.119
everything and then you'll just die

4010.88 --> 4013.119
foreign

4014.02 --> 4019.7599999999998
that you're going to psychosomatically

4016.4 --> 4022.039
reinforce that procedure

4019.76 --> 4024.8190000000004
and then really believe that that's just

4022.039 --> 4024.8190000000004
how it goes

4025.46 --> 4029.559
and then you will degenerate and die

4030.619 --> 4036.079
if you realize like no all those things

4033.859 --> 4038.48
that people like automatically take for

4036.079 --> 4039.5
granted and never gives a second glance

4038.48 --> 4041.78
at

4039.5 --> 4046.42
well a lot of those are

4041.78 --> 4046.42
like psychosomatic reinforcements

4047.66 --> 4052.299
they don't have to be like that

4056.72 --> 4061.22
I mean some things are inevitable if

4059.72 --> 4063.2
it's like typically in your family that

4061.22 --> 4065.0
you like get gray hair very early or

4063.2 --> 4067.2799999999997
that you get balds very early right

4065.0 --> 4070.24
those things are like you can't really

4067.28 --> 4070.2400000000002
avoid that then

4070.28 --> 4074.6600000000003
but

4071.539 --> 4076.6400000000003
that's then so like something special

4074.66 --> 4078.2599999999998
that doesn't mean it happens to everyone

4076.64 --> 4081.02
you see

4078.26 --> 4083.26
or in general or with other aspects of

4081.02 --> 4083.2599999999998
you

4085.7 --> 4091.3999999999996
right somebody might age like

4089.0 --> 4094.52
with their skin that they really gotta

4091.4 --> 4099.04
become old looking but that their spirit

4094.52 --> 4099.04
is real young still on the inside

4100.0 --> 4106.88
although that is kind of right usually

4102.4 --> 4109.699
like the way people look does reflect

4106.88 --> 4112.299
their inner spirit

4109.699 --> 4112.299
foreign

4120.98 --> 4126.678999999999
but yeah my dad also like just very

4124.4 --> 4129.44
conscious like yeah

4126.679 --> 4130.359
he's 70 now and he's like yeah but I'm

4129.44 --> 4135.08
just

4130.359 --> 4138.02
I still am like I'm 30 except my body is

4135.08 --> 4140.96
a little bit more worn that's all

4138.02 --> 4143.620000000001
but my body's a bit more worn but I'm a

4140.96 --> 4143.62
lot wiser

4143.779 --> 4150.799000000001
and I've been through things so I don't

4147.02 --> 4153.14
get like seductions as much because I

4150.799 --> 4154.94
just know everything about that now it

4153.14 --> 4156.679
doesn't bother me anymore

4154.94 --> 4159.3189999999995
I've learned a lot

4156.679 --> 4161.5
from my dad from his descriptions of

4159.319 --> 4161.5
that

4162.739 --> 4170.48
it's it's like a very reinsuring Outlook

4166.16 --> 4172.699
because I've been very afraid of Aging

4170.48 --> 4174.678999999999
also well because just look at my mom

4172.699 --> 4176.178999999999
how wrong that went and I kind of

4174.679 --> 4179.02
thought

4176.179 --> 4181.339
like how much of that really was just

4179.02 --> 4184.040000000001
Pharmaceuticals and how much of it was

4181.339 --> 4186.5599999999995
really her

4184.04 --> 4190.219
like would it have happened even if she

4186.56 --> 4193.400000000001
hadn't like spiraled and just

4190.219 --> 4195.199
medically spiraled like taking too many

4193.4 --> 4197.78
Pharmaceuticals

4195.199 --> 4200.299999999999
would it still have happened would she

4197.78 --> 4203.9
would still have died then I don't know

4200.3 --> 4205.28
but my dad's basically like no but

4203.9 --> 4208.339999999999
that's

4205.28 --> 4209.36
it that you don't look at that as an

4208.34 --> 4211.28
example

4209.36 --> 4214.5199999999995
to think of your own future because

4211.28 --> 4217.599999999999
that's very unlikely

4214.52 --> 4217.6
just look at me

4221.239 --> 4229.36
right and I'd love to be like my dad

4224.0 --> 4229.36
like in when I'm his age his current age

4229.699 --> 4234.5199999999995
he's great

4231.14 --> 4234.52
I'm very proud of him

4237.32 --> 4242.84
I mean he's not like a big money

4239.9 --> 4245.54
slanging guy

4242.84 --> 4248.179
it doesn't have like 10 children or

4245.54 --> 4251.9
something it's just got me but like he's

4248.179 --> 4254.9
a really sharp wise person and he is

4251.9 --> 4259.0599999999995
still very eager to live and learn

4254.9 --> 4259.0599999999995
and I greatly admire that

4260.48 --> 4262.839999999999
anyway

4278.44 --> 4283.339999999999
okay Matthew Hall

4281.239 --> 4286.419999999999
yeah that's

4283.34 --> 4286.42
not bad man

4295.52 --> 4301.64
do I believe in demons well that depends

4298.58 --> 4303.86
on how you define demons Ian Adams but

4301.64 --> 4305.3
yeah

4303.86 --> 4308.78
but

4305.3 --> 4311.4400000000005
that all depends on what you assume

4308.78 --> 4311.44
demons are

4311.9 --> 4314.08
thank you

4314.739 --> 4320.299999999999
like are you gonna do your reference to

4317.78 --> 4322.34
demon as like a consciousness

4320.3 --> 4325.360000000001
or demons as in

4322.34 --> 4327.92
our personal demons like on the inside

4325.36 --> 4330.46
that we face

4327.92 --> 4334.1
or not face

4330.46 --> 4336.02
or you're talking about some

4334.1 --> 4337.820000000001
biblical

4336.02 --> 4343.1
devil

4337.82 --> 4346.88
entity that is like beside God and doing

4343.1 --> 4346.88
these things like yeah

4347.78 --> 4353.739
basically depends on the angle of

4350.36 --> 4353.739
approach or even the cosmology

4362.0 --> 4365.069
[Music]

4372.28 --> 4378.259999999999
I mean

4374.659 --> 4380.9
I've never like no like lost my

4378.26 --> 4384.64
Consciousness to an entity that took me

4380.9 --> 4384.639999999999
over that's never happened

4386.0 --> 4389.92
but I've seen it with other people

4390.86 --> 4398.259999999999
so if you consider that to be a demon

4393.44 --> 4398.259999999999
taking over then yeah I've seen that

4400.76 --> 4405.14
absolutely

4403.52 --> 4409.34
but

4405.14 --> 4412.64
what did what it how I see it is like

4409.34 --> 4414.56
if somebody basically relinquishes like

4412.64 --> 4416.96
their control panel of their

4414.56 --> 4418.780000000001
Consciousness then another thing can

4416.96 --> 4422.719
step in

4418.78 --> 4425.179
but it will use other levers

4422.719 --> 4428.0
within the mind

4425.179 --> 4430.1
of how to do things then you're normal

4428.0 --> 4431.48
consciously conscious would typically do

4430.1 --> 4435.5
because

4431.48 --> 4438.5
the demon does not have any objection so

4435.5 --> 4441.699
it can utilize other skills that are

4438.5 --> 4441.699
kind of dormant in you

4441.8 --> 4445.34
so

4443.12 --> 4448.099999999999
that's usually how you recognize a demon

4445.34 --> 4451.46
is that a person like subtly behaves in

4448.1 --> 4454.52
a very very different way

4451.46 --> 4456.8
like very unlike their character

4454.52 --> 4461.1990000000005
with like a dark

4456.8 --> 4461.1990000000005
brooding intention to it

4463.88 --> 4468.56
also often associated with like a dark

4466.28 --> 4470.719
mood like with somebody's like getting

4468.56 --> 4472.46
possessed by the devil you could say

4470.719 --> 4475.34
that and then they're like up to no good

4472.46 --> 4477.679
they like wanna create Mischief or

4475.34 --> 4480.8
something you could say like that is

4477.679 --> 4483.1990000000005
sort of a a devil

4480.8 --> 4485.659000000001
possessing them and somebody can really

4483.199 --> 4487.879999999999
even start to like accept that and then

4485.659 --> 4491.259999999999
it becomes a part of them and then they

4487.88 --> 4491.26
become kind of nasty people

4491.96 --> 4497.659
right so things happen

4494.719 --> 4500.06
you can get like a

4497.659 --> 4502.219
sort of a possession it's like something

4500.06 --> 4504.7390000000005
comes over you is how they say it

4502.219 --> 4508.159
something just comes over you

4504.739 --> 4510.678999999999
but you can then let it go

4508.159 --> 4514.159
enact it and then figure it out and let

4510.679 --> 4518.62
it go or you can actually say no this is

4514.159 --> 4518.62
I'm going to think that this is who I am

4520.28 --> 4524.239
and then you kind of like integrate and

4522.56 --> 4526.9400000000005
then you keep doing that and then that

4524.239 --> 4530.08
demon becomes a part of you

4526.94 --> 4533.719
so it's all kinds of ways how you can

4530.08 --> 4536.199
describe it demons

4533.719 --> 4536.199
see

4540.32 --> 4547.719
oh one big Pawn

4543.26 --> 4550.219
send the truth to the world of spin

4547.719 --> 4551.02
well and don't I'm not just here to

4550.219 --> 4554.5
address

4551.02 --> 4554.5
Ballers though but

4564.02 --> 4569.620000000001
pain on that shoulder all right that

4566.3 --> 4569.62
makes sense Ian Adams because

4569.9 --> 4576.0199999999995
you're talking about a non-possessing

4572.56 --> 4577.580000000001
extra bodily entity

4576.02 --> 4579.56
then

4577.58 --> 4582.92
I think that's probably more like a

4579.56 --> 4586.580000000001
shadow than a demon because a demon

4582.92 --> 4588.7390000000005
in my experience doesn't actually have

4586.58 --> 4591.44
those qualities

4588.739 --> 4595.78
demons like really only

4591.44 --> 4595.78
are identifiable through your own mind

4596.3 --> 4600.6990000000005
because they don't take form

4601.04 --> 4605.739
that's other things

4603.5 --> 4608.199
but there are things out there like

4605.739 --> 4612.08
nature Spirits Maybe

4608.199 --> 4614.239
that do actually feed off pain so if

4612.08 --> 4616.4
you're like pain in your shoulder then

4614.239 --> 4620.48
yeah you could potentially see something

4616.4 --> 4624.58
or some Shadow draped around it

4620.48 --> 4624.58
because it's feeding off the pain

4625.52 --> 4631.88
see its face that's creepy

4628.1 --> 4634.04
right but that is it's more like an

4631.88 --> 4635.54
amoeba that's just sitting on it like oh

4634.04 --> 4638.659
when you're in here yeah there's the

4635.54 --> 4638.659
energy it's

4639.08 --> 4644.239
right

4641.239 --> 4646.04
it's kind of it's like a jungle thing a

4644.239 --> 4648.799999999999
jungle of spirits

4646.04 --> 4652.12
it's just they're feeding and as soon as

4648.8 --> 4652.12
that goes away they'll stop

4652.52 --> 4657.9800000000005
they'll go yeah as soon as the pain is

4655.46 --> 4659.42
resolved they go away too

4657.98 --> 4662.239
right I wouldn't worry about that

4659.42 --> 4664.9
although I I try to take care of your

4662.239 --> 4664.9
shoulder though

4666.08 --> 4671.48
be very careful with that

4668.78 --> 4673.04
like I have to actually

4671.48 --> 4675.678999999999
do

4673.04 --> 4678.44
pretty regular massages on my own

4675.679 --> 4681.1990000000005
shoulder sometimes

4678.44 --> 4683.36
because if I don't it gets really

4681.199 --> 4686.419999999999
cramped sometimes and then I could like

4683.36 --> 4689.0
pull a muscle by accident and then it

4686.42 --> 4694.04
really is [ __ ] painful

4689.0 --> 4696.26
so I basically in my own masseuse

4694.04 --> 4698.8
just to prevent that sort of thing from

4696.26 --> 4698.8
happening

4698.9 --> 4705.98
and luckily enough I am kind of flexible

4701.719 --> 4708.7390000000005
in my arms and I keep them very flexible

4705.98 --> 4712.04
because if I wouldn't then I wouldn't be

4708.739 --> 4715.159
able to do that it's like I have to be

4712.04 --> 4718.06
all those things to keep myself

4715.159 --> 4718.0599999999995
functional

4722.06 --> 4724.659000000001
anyway

4728.06 --> 4732.88
mental health problems from eight years

4730.159 --> 4732.879999999999
in what sense

4732.98 --> 4736.639999999999
how is that mental health problem you're

4735.08 --> 4739.179
seeing things

4736.64 --> 4739.179
right

4739.219 --> 4743.659
well

4741.679 --> 4745.6990000000005
yeah so

4743.659 --> 4748.099999999999
it's not a problem

4745.699 --> 4751.0599999999995
it's only a problem if you get all hyped

4748.1 --> 4753.92
up about it and try to convince

4751.06 --> 4756.56
psychiat psychologist or whatever of

4753.92 --> 4758.42
that it's a real thing like that

4756.56 --> 4761.900000000001
just

4758.42 --> 4764.0
don't complain to a doctor about seeing

4761.9 --> 4766.04
a weird creature

4764.0 --> 4768.38
because they'll just give you weird

4766.04 --> 4771.44
psychotropic [ __ ]

4768.38 --> 4773.659000000001
like enter like uh anti-psychotics or

4771.44 --> 4777.639999999999
whatever like they don't have anything

4773.659 --> 4777.639999999999
to do with that at all

4778.52 --> 4783.080000000001
you're gonna have to work that out with

4780.38 --> 4786.4400000000005
people that are more

4783.08 --> 4789.1
apt in figuring out spiritual things and

4786.44 --> 4789.099999999999
experiences

4792.44 --> 4795.28
like me

4801.5 --> 4806.679
turmeric everything is oh that's awesome

4809.239 --> 4813.739
is that because I advised it

4811.94 --> 4816.0199999999995
or did you discover it on your own

4813.739 --> 4818.919999999999
before that

4816.02 --> 4818.92
one big Palm

4841.82 --> 4846.799999999999
but yeah turmeric is great I was

4843.8 --> 4850.88
promoting it with my turmeric coffee for

4846.8 --> 4854.179
like half the Early Bird shows

4850.88 --> 4855.92
but yeah then the coffee aspect it's not

4854.179 --> 4858.7390000000005
great

4855.92 --> 4861.02
so I quit the coffee

4858.739 --> 4864.339999999999
but I still use turmeric I mean I have a

4861.02 --> 4864.34
supplement that has it in it

4866.3 --> 4871.58
this one a softball Meadow complex and

4869.48 --> 4874.599999999999
it has turmeric in it by the way also

4871.58 --> 4874.6
has green tea in it

4874.699 --> 4882.08
just curcuma in it green tea let's go

4878.719 --> 4884.2390000000005
under my my turkey

4882.08 --> 4885.94
Ginger

4884.239 --> 4890.139999999999
nettle

4885.94 --> 4890.139999999999
selenium black pepper

4890.9 --> 4893.679
and of course

4894.739 --> 4899.12
right

4896.12 --> 4904.239
it's America is great

4899.12 --> 4904.239
cinnamon honey that's interesting

4906.92 --> 4911.96
oh you you figured it out on your own

4908.84 --> 4914.14
okay no problem of course not good on

4911.96 --> 4914.14
you

4914.54 --> 4917.54
foreign

4921.08 --> 4930.4
I mean I figured it out I think around

4925.36 --> 4930.4
2016. so you actually beat me to it

4933.72 --> 4936.899
[Music]

4942.94 --> 4948.5599999999995
but I did really try it out on my own

4946.219 --> 4951.32
volition nobody was giving me an example

4948.56 --> 4953.06
I was just like huh what if I just put a

4951.32 --> 4955.88
little bit of this but I mean they're

4953.06 --> 4958.52
like herbs that typically would fit

4955.88 --> 4962.659000000001
together like

4958.52 --> 4964.64
coffee turmeric it is kind of India in

4962.659 --> 4966.679
that sense I thought so I was like oh

4964.64 --> 4968.659000000001
they probably would fit together so I

4966.679 --> 4970.6990000000005
just tried it out and was like whoa this

4968.659 --> 4975.46
is great

4970.699 --> 4975.46
tastes amazing like different but great

4976.1 --> 4981.38
yeah

4977.9 --> 4984.86
I miss turmeric coffee sometimes

4981.38 --> 4987.7390000000005
maybe I'll try it like one time sometime

4984.86 --> 4989.42
just to see what happens Patton had it

4987.739 --> 4991.759999999999
in such a long time

4989.42 --> 4995.02
maybe it'll be different now that I've

4991.76 --> 4995.02
stopped drinking alcohol

5000.82 --> 5006.759999999999
although it would probably still give a

5003.46 --> 5010.02
like a not so good reaction because of

5006.76 --> 5010.02
the smoking cannabis

5010.6 --> 5015.6990000000005
like sometimes the combination of that

5012.82 --> 5017.44
like works out really bad even though

5015.699 --> 5021.099999999999
it's been like especially when I was

5017.44 --> 5024.28
younger like coffee and cannabis smoking

5021.1 --> 5026.860000000001
worked like really great together make

5024.28 --> 5029.32
me feel like really pumped

5026.86 --> 5032.139999999999
enthusiastic

5029.32 --> 5035.38
but then later it started to give like

5032.14 --> 5038.1990000000005
this sort of weird allergy reaction type

5035.38 --> 5040.659000000001
feeling well not allergy it's like

5038.199 --> 5041.799999999999
it just would make histamines or

5040.659 --> 5044.5599999999995
something

5041.8 --> 5047.34
it would it get it would get me agitated

5044.56 --> 5047.34
and itchier

5051.04 --> 5056.34
but to be fair I've never tested it out

5053.199 --> 5056.339999999999
even without cannabis

5056.44 --> 5058.839999999999
because

5057.64 --> 5062.8
I

5058.84 --> 5065.400000000001
never drank coffee when I wasn't smoking

5062.8 --> 5065.400000000001
cannabis

5068.02 --> 5072.1
yeah

5070.48 --> 5075.04
yeah the times that I wasn't smoking

5072.1 --> 5077.5
cannabis I wasn't drinking coffee

5075.04 --> 5078.719
huh

5077.5 --> 5083.26
right

5078.719 --> 5087.28
no way that's not entirely true actually

5083.26 --> 5089.679
my name was 2008

5087.28 --> 5092.94
I wasn't smoking cannabis but I think I

5089.679 --> 5092.9400000000005
was drinking coffee then

5093.58 --> 5097.179
I was more struggling with sugar at the

5095.86 --> 5099.839999999999
time

5097.179 --> 5099.84
hmm

5101.44 --> 5106.599999999999
but I think yeah that it does like if

5104.5 --> 5108.159
you combine it

5106.6 --> 5109.84
it's not great but maybe it's the

5108.159 --> 5113.0199999999995
tobacco because it was still smoking

5109.84 --> 5114.88
tobacco then and that the tobacco come

5113.02 --> 5118.120000000001
maybe it's the tobacco the combination

5114.88 --> 5120.219
with the coffee and not the Cannabis I'm

5118.12 --> 5122.14
not sure I'm not sure on how I'm gonna

5120.219 --> 5122.4800000000005
test that either

5122.14 --> 5123.6990000000005
foreign

5122.48 --> 5126.28
[Music]

5123.699 --> 5129.699
anyway I'm not drinking coffee for a

5126.28 --> 5133.32
while but I do miss it sometimes

5129.699 --> 5133.32
also because yeah the

5133.719 --> 5139.679
yeah well anyway if you've drank coffee

5136.3 --> 5139.679
then you know why

5140.32 --> 5145.679
because it gets you pumped

5143.199 --> 5145.678999999999
anyway

5149.62 --> 5155.34
turmeric

5150.94 --> 5155.339999999999
medicinal herb request studies yes

5156.58 --> 5163.199
and there's so many different variations

5159.58 --> 5163.199
of the turmeric root even

5165.34 --> 5170.38
there's ones that are more spicy that

5167.8 --> 5172.96
are ones that are more

5170.38 --> 5176.5
they have more curcuminoid like the the

5172.96 --> 5178.36
really the healing ingredient

5176.5 --> 5182.02
and then there's ones that are like

5178.36 --> 5184.12
really special tasting so there's all

5182.02 --> 5186.34
kinds of different turmeric Roots by now

5184.12 --> 5187.84
like I think hundreds of different types

5186.34 --> 5190.719
maybe thousands

5187.84 --> 5193.719
it's just as much it's like there's

5190.719 --> 5196.7390000000005
lavender types there's like 50 or 60

5193.719 --> 5196.7390000000005
types of lavender

5198.46 --> 5203.5
I happen to know that because if there

5200.92 --> 5206.02
was like this place this Garden where

5203.5 --> 5207.58
they had that it's like what all these

5206.02 --> 5210.159000000001
different types of Leaven it was really

5207.58 --> 5212.26
weird to me like why would you have that

5210.159 --> 5214.299999999999
many different types of lavender

5212.26 --> 5216.46
okay

5214.3 --> 5217.96
but yeah with turmeric that is very

5216.46 --> 5219.82
logical

5217.96 --> 5222.719
because they have so many different

5219.82 --> 5222.719
types of properties

5224.739 --> 5229.959999999999
you put turmeric in your mashed potatoes

5227.5 --> 5233.76
okay

5229.96 --> 5233.76
the yeah that could work

5238.3 --> 5245.1
well I'll use a bit of turmeric when I

5240.58 --> 5245.1
like make more Asian type dishes

5247.42 --> 5252.28
but not a lot of it I mean I already

5250.06 --> 5255.46
have it in a supplement I mean

5252.28 --> 5257.32
the actual Taste of turmeric I'm not

5255.46 --> 5260.5
like wow

5257.32 --> 5262.9
I love that no not specific I like it

5260.5 --> 5265.3
with the coffee but in general it's like

5262.9 --> 5267.5199999999995
yeah I mean if you mix it up with some

5265.3 --> 5269.4400000000005
other things like ginger and then it

5267.52 --> 5272.9800000000005
just becomes like this Asian kind of

5269.44 --> 5275.08
taste and then or Curry right

5272.98 --> 5277.36
and that's different

5275.08 --> 5279.639
than just a tumeric

5277.36 --> 5281.62
so

5279.639 --> 5283.12
it's not like an herb you can just put

5281.62 --> 5285.639
in everything

5283.12 --> 5287.62
or maybe you can maybe you really love

5285.639 --> 5289.06
it and you as you say you put it in your

5287.62 --> 5293.94
mashed potatoes

5289.06 --> 5293.9400000000005
okay why not if you like it then why not

5309.699 --> 5315.239
turmeric and gingery okay yeah yeah that

5312.88 --> 5315.2390000000005
will work

5317.86 --> 5323.04
wouldn't that be weird like a tumeric

5320.5 --> 5323.04
ale

5329.679 --> 5336.42
yeah turmeric ginger ale would be

5332.679 --> 5336.42
interesting it but

5336.94 --> 5339.54
yeah

5339.76 --> 5344.02
I mean is it gonna have that property

5341.98 --> 5347.259999999999
really I mean does ginger ale really

5344.02 --> 5351.360000000001
have ginger properties

5347.26 --> 5351.360000000001
I mean it's it is a fizzy drink

5352.42 --> 5357.6990000000005
and those are usually not particularly

5355.06 --> 5360.179
nutritious compared to just the product

5357.699 --> 5360.178999999999
normally

5360.82 --> 5364.259999999999
that's supposed to be in it

5365.86 --> 5370.0199999999995
man all this food talks make me hungry

5371.739 --> 5381.159
in and on everything pizzas okay

5377.62 --> 5382.239
I guess you really love it then okay

5381.159 --> 5385.44
fine

5382.239 --> 5385.44
if you love it you love it

5391.239 --> 5397.259999999999
it's America by the three wise men

5393.94 --> 5397.259999999999
that's interesting

5398.38 --> 5404.08
I

5400.659 --> 5406.44
I say that's a very plausible train of

5404.08 --> 5406.44
thinking

5413.679 --> 5417.659
and it would make sense because

5419.02 --> 5425.5
the other two things were also kind of

5422.139 --> 5430.1990000000005
spices right

5425.5 --> 5430.199
incense gold and myrrh

5430.36 --> 5434.38
well if that gold would have been

5431.98 --> 5438.54
tumeric then it's literally all spices

5434.38 --> 5438.54
it would be like spices from the East

5457.02 --> 5462.0
ashwagandha tea for concentration is

5459.28 --> 5464.5599999999995
that good for it because I have

5462.0 --> 5466.12
ashwagandha I've just not really tried

5464.56 --> 5468.34
it yet

5466.12 --> 5470.739
but I got that supplement from my

5468.34 --> 5473.139
stepmother during Christmas

5470.739 --> 5476.58
I'm just like I don't know I don't know

5473.139 --> 5476.58
if I should be using it

5476.679 --> 5480.2390000000005
I want to know more about it

5484.3 --> 5487.56
but I do have it

5492.51 --> 5495.6990000000005
[Music]

5508.12 --> 5512.679
get used to cleaning up right after

5510.159 --> 5515.32
preparing yeah then well that's a good

5512.679 --> 5516.82
habit to have anyway one big pun I do

5515.32 --> 5519.34
that usually

5516.82 --> 5523.0199999999995
like when I'm cooking I'm just

5519.34 --> 5523.02
immediately washing the dishes

5525.76 --> 5531.659000000001
because that way it's much easier to

5527.44 --> 5531.659
clean off I can do it pretty fast

5532.36 --> 5537.719
and it doesn't leave a mess for the rest

5535.179 --> 5537.719
of the roommates

5548.02 --> 5551.52
right

5549.52 --> 5551.52
now

5565.98 --> 5569.379999999999
right anyway hope you guys are enjoying

5568.42 --> 5572.76
the show

5569.38 --> 5572.76
20 more minutes to go

5614.94 --> 5619.138999999999
magnesium is good for mental health yeah

5619.54 --> 5622.92
good for a whole bunch of things

5625.0 --> 5628.56
I'm just scrolling back because

5629.8 --> 5634.0
I think everybody's probably already

5631.36 --> 5636.159
migrating to

5634.0 --> 5639.84
Heavy D

5636.159 --> 5639.839999999999
ude although I still got 24 watching

5644.38 --> 5647.38
important

5662.62 --> 5667.38
you wash everything before you eat okay

5676.679 --> 5682.0
let me tell you

5679.84 --> 5685.4800000000005
I have a weird habit although maybe it's

5682.0 --> 5688.179
not that weird but like I leave the

5685.48 --> 5690.099999999999
peels on the potatoes like even with

5688.179 --> 5693.36
mashed potatoes

5690.1 --> 5693.360000000001
I just leave it on there

5698.08 --> 5703.42
and like when it was an early teen that

5700.659 --> 5705.099999999999
was Unthinkable to me I hated it but it

5703.42 --> 5708.58
didn't make any sense it was just like

5705.1 --> 5711.219
Oh no you're not supposed to eat it why

5708.58 --> 5713.86
because it's not because it's different

5711.219 --> 5717.219
from the rest of the potato that was it

5713.86 --> 5719.86
but actually eating the peel is

5717.219 --> 5722.32
extremely healthy

5719.86 --> 5725.32
so it turns out to be and that's why I

5722.32 --> 5727.92
just don't peel potatoes anymore

5725.32 --> 5727.92
for anything

5728.139 --> 5730.9800000000005
for baking

5732.699 --> 5738.719
or for mashed

5735.1 --> 5738.719
I just take pill and all

5743.26 --> 5748.780000000001
and it's completely digests so

5746.44 --> 5752.099999999999
it's not like oh you're not supposed to

5748.78 --> 5752.099999999999
eat it no no it's fine

5752.5 --> 5755.88
I think it's actually better

5760.36 --> 5765.339999999999
I mean I

5762.4 --> 5768.699
if if I were to make like my own french

5765.34 --> 5771.78
fries though from from actual potatoes

5768.699 --> 5771.78
that would be different

5772.36 --> 5776.98
but yeah I I mean I buy pre-fab French

5775.78 --> 5779.739
fries

5776.98 --> 5781.54
all organic and yeah data of course

5779.739 --> 5784.78
don't have peels on them

5781.54 --> 5787.679
but anything else potato I'll leave the

5784.78 --> 5787.679
potato peel on

5788.86 --> 5792.46
the people have been telling me like

5790.6 --> 5794.02
throughout my teens like how that or

5792.46 --> 5797.7390000000005
even preteens like how that was

5794.02 --> 5802.139
healthier and I was like no no and now

5797.739 --> 5802.138999999999
I'm like yeah give me those pills baby

5802.5 --> 5805.92
I'll take it

5809.76 --> 5816.7390000000005
[Music]

5822.76 --> 5829.0
my father told me as a Young Man best

5825.34 --> 5830.9800000000005
part of a veggie is at the skin yeah one

5829.0 --> 5833.38
well yeah

5830.98 --> 5835.659
I got that same advice too but I

5833.38 --> 5838.4400000000005
rejected it for a long time because of I

5835.659 --> 5838.44
guess Aesthetics

5839.86 --> 5842.4
but

5842.56 --> 5847.92
for like the last 10 years I well 10

5845.739 --> 5847.919999999999
years

5849.219 --> 5853.3
no it's my ex I was still peeling him

5851.32 --> 5856.9
because it just looks better

5853.3 --> 5860.28
so like last eight years

5856.9 --> 5860.28
I don't peel potatoes

5860.44 --> 5866.44
I mean if they're like covered in dirt

5862.42 --> 5869.679
I'll still wash them carefully but um

5866.44 --> 5873.099999999999
get the like the weird growth thingies

5869.679 --> 5875.4400000000005
out there if they're in on it

5873.1 --> 5878.58
but under that no I just

5875.44 --> 5878.58
leave the peel on

5890.739 --> 5896.0199999999995
all right soft boiled Sprouts salted

5894.4 --> 5899.32
woof

5896.02 --> 5901.659000000001
but yeah I mean Sprouts you should never

5899.32 --> 5904.659
over boil them because they turn into

5901.659 --> 5906.82
snot and that's disgusting

5904.659 --> 5908.92
but if you like boil them that they're

5906.82 --> 5913.44
just that they're still almost a little

5908.92 --> 5913.4400000000005
bit crispy Sprouts are amazing

5913.719 --> 5916.86
really healthy

5921.82 --> 5926.92
no but like mashed potatoes with

5925.12 --> 5931.84
with the

5926.92 --> 5933.52
a good gravy beef gravy of some time

5931.84 --> 5936.639
some kind of meat

5933.52 --> 5939.159000000001
and then Sprouts yeah amazing loving

5936.639 --> 5940.659000000001
lovely makes me think like I actually

5939.159 --> 5944.339999999999
want to get some Sprouts again because

5940.659 --> 5944.339999999999
it's not typically in my diet

5945.219 --> 5951.76
but I should actually get some of that

5949.179 --> 5953.8
why not

5951.76 --> 5956.9800000000005
but usually when I go for mashed

5953.8 --> 5959.4400000000005
potatoes and some meat I tend to go for

5956.98 --> 5962.32
the red beets

5959.44 --> 5966.879999999999
that's what I typically get

5962.32 --> 5972.0599999999995
beef sausage mashed potatoes red beets

5966.88 --> 5972.06
and a lot of butter-based gravy

5975.9 --> 5979.92
but Sprouts could work too

5981.04 --> 5984.9
ah I'm getting really hungry now from

5983.139 --> 5989.46
all this food talk

5984.9 --> 5989.46
so guys what am I gonna call this show

6001.56 --> 6004.04
foreign

6019.02 --> 6022.76
health food for happiness

6028.5 --> 6031.44
but I mean it's not the only thing we've

6030.239 --> 6035.54
talked about

6031.44 --> 6035.54
first we were talking about like

6035.659 --> 6043.28
judging eugenicist Nazis

6040.02 --> 6043.280000000001
maybe you should call it that

6044.36 --> 6048.92
Nazi trials and health foods

6050.94 --> 6054.32
it's a really bizarre

6063.19 --> 6067.08
[Music]

6064.679 --> 6069.4400000000005
that's a really weird comedy I kind of

6067.08 --> 6069.44
like it

6069.9 --> 6076.32
because it's both true

6072.36 --> 6078.239
Judgment Day no not just Nazi trials and

6076.32 --> 6080.88
health food I mean

6078.239 --> 6083.28
why not

6080.88 --> 6085.26
it's kind of weird together

6083.28 --> 6087.36
but that's what we talked about pretty

6085.26 --> 6092.54
much

6087.36 --> 6092.54
judgment there is so do move no no no

6097.44 --> 6100.759999999999
this is what it's gonna be

6103.739 --> 6106.5
foreign

6105.27 --> 6108.84
[Music]

6106.5 --> 6111.239
I mean I'm going to overall just call

6108.84 --> 6114.54
these eugenicists

6111.239 --> 6117.259999999999
globalist w e f people I am going to

6114.54 --> 6120.06
call them Nazis

6117.26 --> 6123.3
they literally support Nazis by the way

6120.06 --> 6126.2390000000005
literal Nazis so I mean

6123.3 --> 6127.26
it's not uncalled for to call on that at

6126.239 --> 6130.259999999999
this point

6127.26 --> 6133.1990000000005
so I will in the future basically start

6130.26 --> 6136.02
referring to them as the Nazis

6133.199 --> 6138.54
so you understand

6136.02 --> 6142.9800000000005
so when I talk about the Nazis it will

6138.54 --> 6147.78
not be white people and Christians or

6142.98 --> 6151.04
the Russians right no no it will be

6147.78 --> 6151.04
the globalists

6151.199 --> 6154.5199999999995
the w e f

6155.52 --> 6160.88
the anti-russian war mongers

6161.88 --> 6165.6
that

6163.56 --> 6168.9800000000005
yeah Ukraine is following right now

6165.6 --> 6168.9800000000005
white of sprouts

6181.739 --> 6188.0599999999995
are they big on sprouts in Ukraine

6185.58 --> 6188.0599999999995
okay

6188.34 --> 6194.3
I don't know but I'm not changing the

6190.56 --> 6194.3
title any further this is going to be it

6194.82 --> 6198.259999999999
thanks for participating though

6202.38 --> 6204.56
thank you

6207.86 --> 6212.699
judging your Genesis yeah

6226.94 --> 6230.659
okay enough already

6234.5 --> 6239.46
can I talk about that now

6237.48 --> 6241.5599999999995
on YouTube

6239.46 --> 6244.8
because I think I got into pretty big

6241.56 --> 6247.1990000000005
trouble because of that earlier

6244.8 --> 6249.84
but is it really good I mean it's an

6247.199 --> 6252.379999999999
anti-parasite that can be good for

6249.84 --> 6252.38
different things

6258.3 --> 6264.6
but yeah I mean it's not something that

6260.52 --> 6266.76
I would say as a Layman not a doctor

6264.6 --> 6270.4800000000005
like oh you should definitely turn to it

6266.76 --> 6272.820000000001
every day no no no I mean

6270.48 --> 6276.659
if there's strong signs that you have

6272.82 --> 6277.98
like some kind of parasite in you in

6276.659 --> 6281.099999999999
some way or

6277.98 --> 6284.48
then it's good to maybe try that and

6281.1 --> 6284.4800000000005
then just do that like once

6285.48 --> 6292.44
until well it starts to affect you in a

6289.619 --> 6293.82
good way and clear up the [ __ ] and then

6292.44 --> 6295.5599999999995
like you don't really need it anymore

6293.82 --> 6297.9
it's not something you should like

6295.56 --> 6302.3
regularly take at all

6297.9 --> 6302.299999999999
but yeah it can be very effective I bet

6306.84 --> 6314.1
I mean if I for example for some reason

6309.96 --> 6316.7390000000005
were to go out into the jungle in Africa

6314.1 --> 6318.08
somewhere or something I want an

6316.739 --> 6321.959999999999
emergency

6318.08 --> 6324.119
set Ivermectin sat with me because yeah

6321.96 --> 6326.639
jungle is Infamous for the amount of

6324.119 --> 6330.36
parasites you can contract there

6326.639 --> 6335.659000000001
right Ivermectin

6330.36 --> 6335.659
it's a miracle cure in a lot of ways

6336.9 --> 6340.759999999999
I'm just not going to make a claim about

6339.239 --> 6343.08
some

6340.76 --> 6345.179
conceptual thing

6343.08 --> 6346.92
that's never actually been proven to

6345.179 --> 6349.679
exist I'm not going to claim that it

6346.92 --> 6352.4
cures that you see because that doesn't

6349.679 --> 6352.4
even exist

6361.28 --> 6367.5
although the condition

6363.86 --> 6372.36
it might help against the earlier

6367.5 --> 6375.26
Associated condition that you could get

6372.36 --> 6375.259999999999
naturally

6385.86 --> 6390.599999999999
better natural remedy maybe maybe

6387.6 --> 6393.1990000000005
there's better ways I don't know

6390.6 --> 6393.1990000000005
foreign

6404.119 --> 6412.259999999999
stay away from it it's not it's not that

6409.56 --> 6414.719
bad or detrimental flatter Sage come on

6412.26 --> 6417.38
it's just yeah there's other ways to do

6414.719 --> 6417.38
it but it

6417.719 --> 6420.199
right

6431.58 --> 6434.58
foreign

6438.739 --> 6446.638999999999
I mean maybe like certain medicine men

6442.619 --> 6448.86
in Africa do know how to like get rid of

6446.639 --> 6451.46
parasites just using a couple of roots

6448.86 --> 6451.46
and herbs

6452.699 --> 6457.0199999999995
maybe they already know

6455.04 --> 6460.199
but I mean Ivermectin is just like an

6457.02 --> 6462.360000000001
industrial Pro Era product

6460.199 --> 6467.219
industrial no it's like modern era

6462.36 --> 6469.619
product that does like function and it's

6467.219 --> 6471.2390000000005
like it doesn't like rot or anything so

6469.619 --> 6476.0
it's you could just make it and then

6471.239 --> 6476.0
keep it around forever I think

6478.02 --> 6482.34
so it's very practical for a long term

6480.42 --> 6484.679
storage right well if you're going to

6482.34 --> 6487.32
make some herb thingy you're going to

6484.679 --> 6489.36
have to make it on the spot

6487.32 --> 6493.94
and then you can't keep it around for

6489.36 --> 6493.94
years because then it will probably rot

6494.58 --> 6497.119
right

6500.34 --> 6508.02
so don't just say oh it's bad because

6505.679 --> 6510.3
there's a natural way to do it yeah but

6508.02 --> 6513.06
everything has advantages and

6510.3 --> 6514.8
disadvantages in that sense

6513.06 --> 6517.76
I think it's a good product that it

6514.8 --> 6517.76
exists definitely

6517.98 --> 6522.86
I praised it in the past and I'm gonna

6520.08 --> 6522.86
stick to that

6532.38 --> 6537.06
fertility nonsense that's absolute

6535.32 --> 6539.639
nonsense you're saying there's been a

6537.06 --> 6543.38
lot of complete [ __ ]

6539.639 --> 6543.38
that have been spouted about it

6543.98 --> 6551.699
why because that's literally like think

6547.98 --> 6554.759999999999
of it as billions of dollars being

6551.699 --> 6558.379999999999
rolled out handed out to people that

6554.76 --> 6558.38
would do just whatever they said

6559.08 --> 6565.139
and Ivermectin was it it was the thing

6563.1 --> 6570.5
sort of competing

6565.139 --> 6574.4400000000005
in the conscious out there a bit with

6570.5 --> 6577.679
the you know what shot

6574.44 --> 6580.699
so that was that's just all a bunch of

6577.679 --> 6583.619
lying rumor [ __ ] that has rolled out

6580.699 --> 6587.339999999999
just to prevent people from grabbing

6583.619 --> 6590.36
that and moving away from the shots

6587.34 --> 6590.360000000001
that's what that was

6594.9 --> 6599.96
tin truth I don't what the who the [ __ ]

6597.659 --> 6599.96
is that

6604.56 --> 6608.76
you have no idea what you're talking

6605.82 --> 6611.36
about Joe Sanford

6608.76 --> 6611.360000000001
foreign

6621.8 --> 6627.179
look if you're gonna be good but then

6624.78 --> 6629.5199999999995
it's your [ __ ] issue okay Jared

6627.179 --> 6632.6990000000005
Sanford because it isn't it's not bad

6629.52 --> 6634.5
not something it's not like a supplement

6632.699 --> 6635.71
you take every day yeah if you're doing

6634.5 --> 6638.52
