so yeah the weather today is

110.88 --> 117.65899999999999
dreary although just just now five

115.02 --> 119.219
minutes ago it stopped raining because

117.659 --> 121.52000000000001
it's been pretty much raining all

119.219 --> 121.52
morning

122.82 --> 127.079
from that big cloud you see over there

125.46 --> 130.64
now

127.079 --> 130.64
or another one

131.76 --> 133.76
um

136.14 --> 141.98
can't really tell

137.879 --> 141.98
where the wind is taking the clouds

142.8 --> 146.22
they don't seem to really Rush up there

144.72 --> 149.879
but anyway

146.22 --> 152.04
it is kind of windy and it is rainy

149.879 --> 154.94
still it's not that cold though

152.04 --> 154.94
surprisingly

157.08 --> 162.44000000000003
foreign

159.66 --> 165.12
but yeah not the best of weathers and

162.44 --> 167.84
even yesterday going out for groceries

165.12 --> 167.84
it was a real

168.48 --> 176.22
feat of timing to get get the groceries

172.5 --> 176.22
in between rainstorms

182.819 --> 188.099
so

184.5 --> 190.62
hello Latter Day Saints please don't

188.099 --> 193.07999999999998
caps spam

190.62 --> 195.3
I would appreciate that

193.08 --> 198.78
one father unit

195.3 --> 206.09900000000002
good to see you gaining wisdom

198.78 --> 206.099
yeah it's Sunday the 1st of August 2021

208.98 --> 212.11999999999998
it's an hour show today

213.84 --> 219.9
ah so yeah

216.92 --> 222.05999999999997
I spend a lot of time by the way like

219.9 --> 224.09900000000002
even like half the day

222.06 --> 226.5
before I go to bed when I get up

224.099 --> 228.48
thinking about like what is the title

226.5 --> 231.36
card gonna be this time

228.48 --> 233.7
and I managed to fix something again

231.36 --> 235.14000000000001
half an hour in advance and Adam was

233.7 --> 239.099
there and he

235.14 --> 241.26
fixed it up so yeah

239.099 --> 245.099
did it again

241.26 --> 246.659
very happy with it very relevant

245.099 --> 250.14
yet

246.659 --> 251.89999999999998
I don't really even have to

250.14 --> 254.819
mention

251.9 --> 256.979
contextual words for people to

254.819 --> 259.15999999999997
completely understand what this title is

256.979 --> 259.15999999999997
about

259.32 --> 266.419
if you're halfway able to critically

262.68 --> 266.419
think about what's going on in the world

268.8 --> 273.36
that's a good thing

271.44 --> 275.71999999999997
if you know how

273.36 --> 275.72
right

278.04 --> 282.3
so yeah yesterday ball busters was live

281.4 --> 285.419
again

282.3 --> 287.88
although I was barely really on it

285.419 --> 291.24
I was a little bit rompussy

287.88 --> 293.1
at the start and then QE

291.24 --> 295.38
kind of cut me

293.1 --> 297.3
down on the spot and after that I was

295.38 --> 299.699
just like no just let's leave it to the

297.3 --> 301.979
guys they're doing great Adam was really

299.699 --> 303.479
active Nathan was really active and I

301.979 --> 306.36
felt like

303.479 --> 308.75899999999996
now I'll just get borderline ball

306.36 --> 311.58000000000004
winning or something so

308.759 --> 315.47900000000004
I'm just gonna stick to chat

311.58 --> 316.979
although I was yeah in the in the panel

315.479 --> 318.24
but it was just stayed on me with most

316.979 --> 321.419
of the time

318.24 --> 323.699
but yeah great show good to have QE back

321.419 --> 326.039
on Saturday

323.699 --> 327.72
I guess like energy wise he had a lot of

326.039 --> 329.759
catching up to do because it was really

327.72 --> 333.38000000000005
eager

329.759 --> 333.38
and yeah that worked out great

334.74 --> 340.1
was both very informative and

337.259 --> 340.1
entertaining Joe

348.18 --> 354.56
right in the meantime out there in media

352.32 --> 354.56
land

355.199 --> 361.5
the information is rushing out on

358.259 --> 365.1
several fronts worldwide

361.5 --> 368.94
that hospitals in contrast the last year

365.1 --> 371.699
are actually filling up now

368.94 --> 375.24
and there's already been

371.699 --> 377.52000000000004
figured out that yeah

375.24 --> 381.24
most of them are vaccinated

377.52 --> 382.71999999999997
it's more than half of all of it every

381.24 --> 385.02
time now so

382.72 --> 388.5
[Music]

385.02 --> 392.039
and in some cases much more

388.5 --> 396.12
and yeah I thought that

392.039 --> 398.09999999999997
well that is partially one of course

396.12 --> 401.16
the title is about

398.1 --> 402.47900000000004
because that is really a thing that that

401.16 --> 405.78000000000003
happened

402.479 --> 407.94
that skunk to knock

405.78 --> 410.15999999999997
the most thickest

407.94 --> 411.9
thickest of suspensive disbelief

410.16 --> 415.02000000000004
upholders

411.9 --> 416.52
It's Gonna Knock them straight

415.02 --> 420.35999999999996
yeah

416.52 --> 422.94
straight out like it's very hard even

420.36 --> 425.41900000000004
when you're very dumb to not take notice

422.94 --> 425.419
of this

427.259 --> 432.84000000000003
right you you actually yeah you could

430.38 --> 434.94
argue that you'd have to be clinically

432.84 --> 436.73999999999995
psychotic not

434.94 --> 439.44
to let this

436.74 --> 440.699
change your view on the situation in the

439.44 --> 443.46
world

440.699 --> 447.84000000000003
if you're like really a statist

443.46 --> 450.71999999999997
medical establishment believer

447.84 --> 454.67999999999995
you really have to be psychotic not to

450.72 --> 458.59900000000005
take this and then let it change you in

454.68 --> 458.599
the way you approach the world right now

462.539 --> 469.639
and that's a very good thing because

464.46 --> 469.63899999999995
this type of scenario usually leads to a

470.819 --> 476.47900000000004
to a break

473.4 --> 476.479
a spell break

480.419 --> 484.69899999999996
so I'm kind of excited about that

484.919 --> 487.75899999999996
anyway

489.31 --> 492.47
[Music]

493.259 --> 499.58000000000004
any thoughts on that Reflections I would

496.62 --> 499.58
appreciate it in chat

522.24 --> 526.5
try not to underestimate yeah yeah of

524.76 --> 531.3
course look I'm not saying it is

526.5 --> 535.2
impossible to ignore it I'm just saying

531.3 --> 539.5999999999999
the pragmatic consequences is that

535.2 --> 539.6
you either become or you stay

540.18 --> 547.1999999999999
psychotic literally like measurably

544.16 --> 550.74
provably psychotic in order to go

547.2 --> 553.62
through that and that look

550.74 --> 556.08
being psychotic

553.62 --> 557.64
is not very

556.08 --> 559.44
useful

557.64 --> 562.92
for a person

559.44 --> 566.1
right it's like derailing

562.92 --> 568.4399999999999
just to keep going with the pattern that

566.1 --> 569.76
has been followed up until the point of

568.44 --> 574.44
psychosis

569.76 --> 577.5
but it makes people lose control over

574.44 --> 579.6600000000001
well their their grip on reality

577.5 --> 582.24
right and that is palpable in this case

579.66 --> 586.3199999999999
so whoever is going to take debate they

582.24 --> 588.779
will regress further they will turn more

586.32 --> 592.019
golemish they will turn more Goblin away

588.779 --> 593.3389999999999
they will sink deeper into the

592.019 --> 595.32
the

593.339 --> 598.8000000000001
the cage

595.32 --> 603.24
they built for themselves in order to

598.8 --> 607.38
deny the reality of the situation

603.24 --> 609.0
and that gives those that do not a

607.38 --> 611.1
slight advantage

609.0 --> 613.399
it's just slight

611.1 --> 613.399
right

614.339 --> 619.5790000000001
but the thing is if enough people can be

620.66 --> 627.42
rescued psychologically

623.94 --> 632.0400000000001
as this is now coming out then

627.42 --> 634.26
we could potentially gain more

632.04 --> 637.76
spiritual overweight

634.26 --> 637.76
over the situation

638.1 --> 644.7
because if it is kind of a fact that in

641.399 --> 647.64
if enough people start to resist

644.7 --> 648.839
like it's going to like halt in its

647.64 --> 651.92
track

648.839 --> 651.9200000000001
the whole situation

652.44 --> 657.72
because the whole thing does ride on the

655.62 --> 659.82
continuation of the story and for the

657.72 --> 663.6600000000001
story to continue There have to be

659.82 --> 666.2600000000001
participants in order to make the part

663.66 --> 666.26
of the story

667.38 --> 674.279
like that includes victims that will be

670.32 --> 676.8000000000001
straw man presented as being

674.279 --> 679.92
victim of something that is more

676.8 --> 681.42
preferable to the story right and that's

679.92 --> 683.279
what they're trying right now I was like

681.42 --> 685.74
oh my God look at all these Delta

683.279 --> 687.779
varying infected people and

685.74 --> 691.32
yeah we're just not gonna tell you that

687.779 --> 694.079
most of them were actually vaccinated

691.32 --> 697.399
but yeah we will find out of course

694.079 --> 697.399
through other sources

701.16 --> 706.519
we're getting good at rushing things yes

703.44 --> 706.519
Adam it's awesome

717.2 --> 721.6800000000001
which man-made technological

719.639 --> 725.42
achievements

721.68 --> 725.42
mankind the most problems

733.68 --> 736.2199999999999
that

735.12 --> 740.16
it

736.22 --> 742.32
that's such a complicated question

740.16 --> 744.5
you know because it all ties in one

742.32 --> 744.5
another

744.6 --> 748.8000000000001
everything does

746.579 --> 753.4399999999999
everything rests on something else I'd

748.8 --> 756.9799999999999
say the invention of Fire or the wheel

753.44 --> 758.5790000000001
but yeah this

756.98 --> 761.12
currently

758.579 --> 764.4799999999999
most problems

761.12 --> 768.42
uh yeah I would say

764.48 --> 770.88
radio communication technology

768.42 --> 774.4799999999999
that entire thing and the media that's

770.88 --> 778.2
come out of it that has allowed

774.48 --> 781.26
such fast levels of indoctrination

778.2 --> 783.779
that beforehand could only be achieved

781.26 --> 785.579
basically in

783.779 --> 787.86
cults

785.579 --> 791.18
and prison camps

787.86 --> 793.8000000000001
right so in our overall the radio

791.18 --> 795.4799999999999
communication technology and everything

793.8 --> 797.639
else that came out of it television

795.48 --> 798.899
including and even the internet in its

797.639 --> 800.22
own right

798.899 --> 802.5
they have

800.22 --> 806.7
made it possible

802.5 --> 809.399
for vast vast amounts of people to be

806.7 --> 811.139
easily indoctrinated

809.399 --> 813.48
and quick

811.139 --> 816.3
quickly relatively quickly

813.48 --> 819.54
and it took some build up right it took

816.3 --> 822.54
some people first needed to trust the

819.54 --> 824.16
medium trust the advantages the

822.54 --> 826.68
quickness and oh

824.16 --> 828.7199999999999
I'm so trendy I'm so informed they

826.68 --> 833.42
needed to go through all that before it

828.72 --> 837.72
could all be achieved right and before

833.42 --> 840.36
this before radio basically came out

837.72 --> 844.5
that level of indoctrination was only

840.36 --> 846.24
before that possible in Cults and prison

844.5 --> 849.42
camps

846.24 --> 852.0
sounds very harsh right but it is true I

849.42 --> 854.779
think it is true

852.0 --> 854.779
so yeah

855.24 --> 859.5600000000001
I hope that answers your question your

857.579 --> 861.9799999999999
very complicated questions demon

859.56 --> 861.9799999999999
Traveler

873.0 --> 878.88
right

875.16 --> 879.959
but like even even this now The Germ

878.88 --> 884.42
Theory

879.959 --> 884.42
has had its own problems but people

884.519 --> 889.16
would resist it much more back in the

886.98 --> 889.16
day

889.32 --> 895.86
right they couldn't push as much it is

891.779 --> 899.459
really the whole rollout of media

895.86 --> 900.779
and social media and top-down media

899.459 --> 904.0189999999999
control

900.779 --> 906.12
that has made the other things into a

904.019 --> 909.3
problem that has allowed the medical

906.12 --> 910.26
system to become a eugenic system like

909.3 --> 912.8389999999999
this

910.26 --> 915.36
although it was probably always planned

912.839 --> 918.6
to become that when it was originally

915.36 --> 920.88
really kind of like standardized by the

918.6 --> 922.9200000000001
Rockefeller Foundation ah yeah yeah

920.88 --> 924.8389999999999
they're getting a mention recently

922.92 --> 927.66
aren't they yeah

924.839 --> 930.12
so it was always kind of designed to

927.66 --> 932.3389999999999
become that on the long run but it is

930.12 --> 937.8
really the media

932.339 --> 941.5790000000001
grip that has allowed it all to mutate

937.8 --> 944.0
into that evil manifestation as what it

941.579 --> 944.0
is now

945.18 --> 950.0
what about indoctrinations through

946.98 --> 950.0
various religions

952.98 --> 955.4590000000001
well

955.8 --> 960.959
how is that a technology though you know

958.16 --> 963.68
your question steamy traveler before was

960.959 --> 966.3599999999999
specifically about technology

963.68 --> 970.2589999999999
religions don't really apply technology

966.36 --> 972.3000000000001
they apply to indoctrinate and to you

970.259 --> 973.6800000000001
know build cultists that is the cult

972.3 --> 976.139
thing right that's the cult thing and

973.68 --> 978.959
that I mentioned that includes Cults

976.139 --> 983.36
that spring forth from religions but not

978.959 --> 983.3599999999999
necessarily exclusively that

983.82 --> 990.259
you can keep it in just a small local

986.339 --> 990.259
group it can be anything but anyway

993.24 --> 997.62
right

994.68 --> 999.899
so unless religions like apply

997.62 --> 1002.839
hallucinatory

999.899 --> 1004.94
Pharma or whatever as part of their

1002.839 --> 1007.5790000000001
indoctrination or some specialized

1004.94 --> 1009.019
ritual to Fascinate you or to stick to

1007.579 --> 1011.62
it

1009.019 --> 1016.0600000000001
they religions didn't really apply

1011.62 --> 1016.0600000000001
man-made technology for it

1016.399 --> 1024.82
talking about prisons and cult yes yes

1020.12 --> 1024.82
so yeah before the radio age

1024.86 --> 1029.6
it yeah

1026.62 --> 1031.579
that's how people's minds were altered

1029.6 --> 1034.839
but the thing is see and this is the

1031.579 --> 1034.839
distinct difference

1034.88 --> 1039.439
that period versus this period that

1037.16 --> 1041.419
period required face-to-face

1039.439 --> 1044.66
communication

1041.419 --> 1047.9
right you'd need a indoctrinator

1044.66 --> 1050.96
for every Community to achieve that so

1047.9 --> 1053.48
any type of indoctrination and cult

1050.96 --> 1056.419
situation would always be much smaller

1053.48 --> 1060.38
scale and meanwhile any group that

1056.419 --> 1063.679
wasn't indoctrinated would be much more

1060.38 --> 1067.2990000000002
privy to resist it and then Wars would

1063.679 --> 1067.299
start and [ __ ] local

1068.12 --> 1072.799
the cultists just started to

1070.16 --> 1075.8200000000002
attack others or whatever they would be

1072.799 --> 1075.82
indoctrinated to do

1078.26 --> 1083.48
right so because of the media

1080.96 --> 1085.94
instead of just

1083.48 --> 1090.08
wet finger worker instead of one person

1085.94 --> 1092.179
for a hundred to indoctrinate

1090.08 --> 1093.32
and keep that individual also under

1092.179 --> 1096.26
control

1093.32 --> 1099.02
now you can have one individual and with

1096.26 --> 1101.6
enough technological grip one could

1099.02 --> 1105.52
indoctrinate a million people

1101.6 --> 1105.52
right that's the big difference

1107.9 --> 1113.3600000000001
right and also they're behind the

1110.24 --> 1115.94
internet so what if something breaks the

1113.36 --> 1119.0
spell breaks the cult nothing yeah they

1115.94 --> 1122.0
might get sued back in the day let's say

1119.0 --> 1123.62
100 200 years ago if a cult

1122.0 --> 1125.96
figure

1123.62 --> 1129.62
if their spell would break

1125.96 --> 1132.26
the cultists would tear him apart right

1129.62 --> 1136.039
because they were physically there

1132.26 --> 1137.96
and now radio technology has made that

1136.039 --> 1141.2
safety net because you can technically

1137.96 --> 1145.039
indoctrinate a million people

1141.2 --> 1147.44
without physically having to face them

1145.039 --> 1150.2
right

1147.44 --> 1153.16
so there's my case

1150.2 --> 1153.16
for your question

1155.179 --> 1160.039
uh hello gaining wisdom

1158.24 --> 1162.559
when you're attracted the message what

1160.039 --> 1165.559
Moon Shadow Thomas

1162.559 --> 1165.559
8955

1167.36 --> 1171.58
Gerard Sanford Dusty Ryder

1171.7 --> 1175.179
good to see you

1176.55 --> 1179.75
[Music]

1181.94 --> 1188.419
right also the formula I just cleared up

1186.679 --> 1191.3600000000001
for you right

1188.419 --> 1194.179
the advantage of internet and radio

1191.36 --> 1196.76
technology to indoctrinate

1194.179 --> 1198.26
is also the reason

1196.76 --> 1201.98
why

1198.26 --> 1202.76
the controllers the Neo feudalists are

1201.98 --> 1205.22
actually

1202.76 --> 1208.82
pendant

1205.22 --> 1212.0
on radio and internet communication in

1208.82 --> 1214.52
order to keep things the way they are to

1212.0 --> 1218.179
keep the crowds

1214.52 --> 1221.72
the peons properly indoctrinated

1218.179 --> 1223.88
now they of course want pure one-sided

1221.72 --> 1225.38
media

1223.88 --> 1228.0200000000002
right

1225.38 --> 1229.7600000000002
but that's very difficult as long as

1228.02 --> 1233.24
there is any media

1229.76 --> 1235.46
other people individuals can break out

1233.24 --> 1237.26
of it technologically like technically

1235.46 --> 1240.2
good pirate right

1237.26 --> 1242.78
even and just one little message can

1240.2 --> 1244.52
have a giant shock wave because it has

1242.78 --> 1247.299
so much reach because of the technology

1244.52 --> 1250.58
right this is their problem they can't

1247.299 --> 1253.6399999999999
fully take it all away because then they

1250.58 --> 1256.34
don't have the grip anymore that allowed

1253.64 --> 1258.0800000000002
this all to become what it is

1256.34 --> 1259.6999999999998
so every time they say oh they're gonna

1258.08 --> 1262.1
shut off the internet this is all going

1259.7 --> 1265.5800000000002
to be a Dark Age no if that if they do

1262.1 --> 1269.059
that it's it is it's all gone

1265.58 --> 1273.1999999999998
then they completely lose control then

1269.059 --> 1275.539
yeah everybody will just start to ignore

1273.2 --> 1277.52
all the indoctrination and media outside

1275.539 --> 1279.3799999999999
and if it's not there anymore and start

1277.52 --> 1281.9
to get on with their lives and actually

1279.38 --> 1284.48
get a life and do something productive

1281.9 --> 1287.419
and become more independent right so

1284.48 --> 1290.78
they're basically stuck in the stalemate

1287.419 --> 1293.0590000000002
situation with with the internet

1290.78 --> 1297.46
they can't really take it away because

1293.059 --> 1297.46
they need it they really do

1299.0 --> 1307.0
or their entire cult spell

1301.88 --> 1307.0
grip on the world will fade rapidly

1309.14 --> 1314.0
is there any way communication systems

1311.299 --> 1315.5
could be yeah I already said that right

1314.0 --> 1318.08
steamy Traveler

1315.5 --> 1321.46
we already have the advantage

1318.08 --> 1324.02
just a couple of voices speaking out

1321.46 --> 1326.3600000000001
saying key things in the right moments

1324.02 --> 1329.179
can totally break spells off the cult

1326.36 --> 1331.52
indoctrination and they have that safety

1329.179 --> 1334.52
net of the barrier in between them right

1331.52 --> 1337.1
they don't have to face the cottage hard

1334.52 --> 1339.1399999999999
face to face to warn them and then if

1337.1 --> 1342.02
the chords are good you bastards and

1339.14 --> 1343.46
tear them up right literally murder them

1342.02 --> 1345.62
on the spot that's what would happen

1343.46 --> 1347.72
like hundreds of years ago with cultists

1345.62 --> 1350.299
if you face them about their cult they

1347.72 --> 1354.02
would freaking murder you in a mob

1350.299 --> 1356.84
right so the Internet safety net allows

1354.02 --> 1358.7
per definition even for just a small

1356.84 --> 1362.6589999999999
hand of people

1358.7 --> 1363.98
to really do some spell breaking

1362.659 --> 1365.7800000000002
out there

1363.98 --> 1368.72
very easily

1365.78 --> 1371.1789999999999
you can't really stop it

1368.72 --> 1374.059
so yes communication systems are

1371.179 --> 1376.4
definitely a great advantage

1374.059 --> 1379.0
to those who wish to

1376.4 --> 1382.8400000000001
bring freedom to the world actual

1379.0 --> 1382.84
individual freedom

1404.5 --> 1409.039
yeah yeah you have to pay them for your

1407.12 --> 1410.1789999999999
indoctrinations right just like you have

1409.039 --> 1413.059
to pay

1410.179 --> 1415.8400000000001
to get your facts now you have to pay

1413.059 --> 1415.84
for that

1432.919 --> 1438.5590000000002
right you have to pay

1435.26 --> 1440.9
the snake to eat you and then you have

1438.559 --> 1443.0
to hold still otherwise he's not going

1440.9 --> 1445.279
to eat you

1443.0 --> 1447.919
so either you have to die overnight and

1445.279 --> 1449.84
then the sneak just says oh [ __ ] it I'm

1447.919 --> 1453.0200000000002
gonna eat this

1449.84 --> 1455.539
or you have to hold really still in

1453.02 --> 1459.7
order for the snake to eat you

1455.539 --> 1459.7
right referencing back into the picture

1460.94 --> 1465.679
hey blood near 23 yeah be back in two

1463.88 --> 1467.8600000000001
minutes

1465.679 --> 1467.8600000000001
foreign

1548.24 --> 1551.24
foreign

1580.179 --> 1583.539
handcuff what

1588.26 --> 1592.8799999999999
I don't exactly remember what you're

1590.36 --> 1595.9399999999998
talking about blunder 23

1592.88 --> 1598.3600000000001
Hancock Scandal what what was that when

1595.94 --> 1598.3600000000001
was that

1612.5 --> 1617.9
a room by decree

1615.559 --> 1620.6
well that's

1617.9 --> 1624.76
so but that's like emergency power

1620.6 --> 1629.98
situation that's not very uncommon

1624.76 --> 1629.98
socialist democracies have that option

1630.74 --> 1635.14
if the majority agrees to it

1642.52 --> 1647.9189999999999
could stand down off the stage

1652.1 --> 1655.059
I don't remember

1657.26 --> 1660.62
okay maybe I'll Google it maybe Google

1659.6 --> 1664.1
will

1660.62 --> 1667.9599999999998
or refresh my memory I might have seen

1664.1 --> 1667.9599999999998
it but I've just forgot what it's about

1669.08 --> 1674.299
June oh this is recently

1688.88 --> 1691.72
oh right

1694.7 --> 1701.0800000000002
right okay yeah I don't know

1698.179 --> 1701.0800000000002
I see now

1703.34 --> 1707.72
this

1705.679 --> 1710.5590000000002
hey Dan Winfield

1707.72 --> 1710.559
good to see you

1731.539 --> 1734.539
ah

1735.02 --> 1739.52
right hey Dan Winfield I hope you're

1737.0 --> 1741.2
doing good I hope you haven't

1739.52 --> 1745.48
been

1741.2 --> 1745.48
duped into taking the vax

1757.58 --> 1761.4189999999999
I mean you are in Britain so it is

1759.74 --> 1764.539
pretty tough to get around Britain

1761.419 --> 1766.5800000000002
without that sort of [ __ ] pushing on you

1764.539 --> 1768.3799999999999
constantly I get it

1766.58 --> 1771.6999999999998
but

1768.38 --> 1771.7
yeah I really hope you didn't

1778.64 --> 1785.8990000000001
yeah Dan Winfield and me go way back

1783.26 --> 1789.82
oh God

1785.899 --> 1789.82
oh okay only the first oh

1790.58 --> 1794.799
oh god dude that's

1803.48 --> 1809.32
all right

1804.74 --> 1809.32
so yeah that's good at least you stop

1810.08 --> 1814.12
I hope it's not gonna cause trouble

1814.76 --> 1819.86
this the first shot is every time I

1817.52 --> 1821.6
think it is like a preparatory shot it

1819.86 --> 1824.4189999999999
like prepares your body for the

1821.6 --> 1827.12
receivable of all this garbage

1824.419 --> 1831.3400000000001
I don't know what type of residual

1827.12 --> 1831.34
long-term influences it has really

1833.299 --> 1839.179
all right then yeah that's good that's a

1835.64 --> 1841.779
good stance to take just

1839.179 --> 1841.779
oh

1843.2 --> 1847.5800000000002
hello by the way Matthew Hall good to

1845.24 --> 1850.58
see you too

1847.58 --> 1850.58
SKS

1859.279 --> 1865.7
you're waiting to what do you mean

1862.399 --> 1865.6999999999998
planet 23.

1866.84 --> 1871.1789999999999
until it's now but it cannot

1872.419 --> 1879.0800000000002
they don't have the legal backing

1876.62 --> 1881.9189999999999
although yeah maybe look

1879.08 --> 1881.9189999999999
in England

1882.799 --> 1889.46
you have the freaking Queen so unless at

1886.159 --> 1893.419
some point she just decides no

1889.46 --> 1897.08
I'm taking mono a monarchical stand you

1893.419 --> 1899.24
will now take the facts peons

1897.08 --> 1901.82
then you got a problem because it's the

1899.24 --> 1903.98
freaking Queen of England and in the

1901.82 --> 1905.6
past she's been kind of like pretty

1903.98 --> 1909.32
rough

1905.6 --> 1912.4399999999998
before if she would go to decide that it

1909.32 --> 1914.84
would probably also seal her fate

1912.44 --> 1915.919
and the fate of the British royalty in

1914.84 --> 1919.039
general

1915.919 --> 1920.419
but she could technically do that

1919.039 --> 1922.64
legally

1920.419 --> 1926.6000000000001
that's the problem

1922.64 --> 1928.96
right now that is an exception situation

1926.6 --> 1928.9599999999998
though

1933.559 --> 1938.539
because pretty much everywhere else they

1936.86 --> 1942.1589999999999
can do that

1938.539 --> 1947.08
without just directly

1942.159 --> 1947.0800000000002
compromising their own power stability

1947.6 --> 1951.6789999999999
because they will break the Nuremberg

1949.519 --> 1956.24
code it's just that

1951.679 --> 1959.48
yeah the the British Monarchy has been

1956.24 --> 1962.96
notorious for ignoring human rights

1959.48 --> 1964.82
related treaties and issues at occasion

1962.96 --> 1966.26
right

1964.82 --> 1969.2
so

1966.26 --> 1971.72
but yeah even if they do that anyway you

1969.2 --> 1973.64
you should still take a stand and just

1971.72 --> 1976.46
not let them do that even if it's going

1973.64 --> 1980.919
to be like military

1976.46 --> 1980.919
drink it and force that

1984.799 --> 1988.96
so I wouldn't be counting on it

1993.74 --> 1998.1200000000001
like I've already made my own

1995.419 --> 2001.48
declarations very early on and that is

1998.12 --> 2005.0189999999998
like if anybody tries to force that I'm

2001.48 --> 2007.84
not gonna wait for to be so oh I'm a

2005.019 --> 2010.36
victim of it they forced it on me oh

2007.84 --> 2012.399
please the next group or whatever please

2010.36 --> 2015.4599999999998
find Justice from no no no

2012.399 --> 2018.76
if somehow in some capacity somebody

2015.46 --> 2021.76
whether it's a crazy cultist individual

2018.76 --> 2024.1
or a police officer or even a freaking

2021.76 --> 2027.399
military or a SWAT team or whatever it

2024.1 --> 2029.5
is if somebody tries to force it in me I

2027.399 --> 2031.84
will take it

2029.5 --> 2034.059
from natural law

2031.84 --> 2036.9399999999998
as a deadly

2034.059 --> 2040.6789999999999
attack attempt on my life

2036.94 --> 2043.96
and I will respond

2040.679 --> 2047.2
potentially preemptively with deadly

2043.96 --> 2048.82
force I made this declaration so that

2047.2 --> 2051.82
everybody

2048.82 --> 2054.7000000000003
that looks into me knows this like you

2051.82 --> 2057.099
cannot do that without

2054.7 --> 2060.2799999999997
it being so important that somebody

2057.099 --> 2062.02
actually willing to risk their own death

2060.28 --> 2063.8790000000004
to do that

2062.02 --> 2066.099
like yeah

2063.879 --> 2069.2799999999997
so the world would be have to have to be

2066.099 --> 2072.04
going completely to ape [ __ ]

2069.28 --> 2075.48
in my view in order for that to ever

2072.04 --> 2075.48
even approach

2078.04 --> 2080.52
right

2081.22 --> 2086.4399999999996
right but it is like when that [ __ ]

2083.919 --> 2088.72
happens yeah nurenberg oh yeah you can

2086.44 --> 2091.679
get Justice afterward or you can take it

2088.72 --> 2091.6789999999996
right there and then

2091.72 --> 2095.379
you have the legal grounds you just have

2093.879 --> 2099.0989999999997
to find the will

2095.379 --> 2102.48
to take lethal action

2099.099 --> 2102.48
to take it serious

2105.82 --> 2110.1400000000003
it's like somebody coming over and

2108.4 --> 2112.54
saying yeah

2110.14 --> 2114.7599999999998
we're gonna seat you you can't come out

2112.54 --> 2116.619
of your house we will grab you take you

2114.76 --> 2119.619
down vaccine that's the same as

2116.619 --> 2120.88
surrounding you with guns and saying

2119.619 --> 2123.099
yeah as soon as you come out of your

2120.88 --> 2129.1800000000003
house we will shoot you

2123.099 --> 2129.1800000000003
yeah it's effectively legally the same

2146.98 --> 2154.359
[Music]

2149.92 --> 2158.619
what no one photo unit that's not true

2154.359 --> 2160.74
no it's not fables it's absolutely

2158.619 --> 2164.5
official the only issue though somebody

2160.74 --> 2167.7999999999997
must be able to execute it you need a

2164.5 --> 2170.859
stable uncorrupted authority of some

2167.8 --> 2173.1400000000003
form to actually do that it's very tough

2170.859 --> 2176.0789999999997
to do it because everything is going to

2173.14 --> 2178.359
be scrambling to escape and to hide and

2176.079 --> 2180.76
to spin their way out everything

2178.359 --> 2182.98
and requires quite a lot of effort to

2180.76 --> 2187.0600000000004
actually enforce the Nuremberg code

2182.98 --> 2189.64
right but legally as an individual as

2187.06 --> 2192.7599999999998
these [ __ ] things are happening you are

2189.64 --> 2194.44
legally allowed to use lethal Force to

2192.76 --> 2196.1400000000003
defend yourselves

2194.44 --> 2199.7200000000003
against

2196.14 --> 2203.02
blatantly obviously

2199.72 --> 2205.18
forced vaccination situation right they

2203.02 --> 2207.099
can tell you it's force it can tell you

2205.18 --> 2210.94
you have to take it that doesn't matter

2207.099 --> 2213.6400000000003
if they actually physically come to you

2210.94 --> 2215.94
and are gonna try to force it in you

2213.64 --> 2219.8199999999997
whether you agree or not

2215.94 --> 2223.18
then that boundary has been crossed and

2219.82 --> 2225.4
you are allowed to apply lethal Force

2223.18 --> 2228.46
against it and you will be protected

2225.4 --> 2232.3
afterward by the Nuremberg hub or you'll

2228.46 --> 2234.4
at least get like major leniency

2232.3 --> 2236.7400000000002
because yeah you might cause excessive

2234.4 --> 2238.839
damage and they'll probably push it

2236.74 --> 2241.1189999999997
against you or whatever

2238.839 --> 2244.119
but like the actual

2241.119 --> 2246.099
lethal Force response

2244.119 --> 2250.92
that is

2246.099 --> 2250.92
that is expected actually of you

2252.76 --> 2256.96
right

2255.099 --> 2259.3590000000004
if everybody's just going to be

2256.96 --> 2261.46
complaining after why did they force it

2259.359 --> 2264.16
on me Nuremberg please

2261.46 --> 2267.339
do that yeah yeah if everybody does that

2264.16 --> 2269.56
then nobody

2267.339 --> 2272.619
is going to actually enforce it and it

2269.56 --> 2276.099
will just be complained until you die

2272.619 --> 2278.079
right no people actually have to take a

2276.099 --> 2280.7400000000002
stand

2278.079 --> 2283.3
damage the corrupted party that are

2280.74 --> 2287.02
enforcing such things

2283.3 --> 2289.2400000000002
otherwise it's not gonna break

2287.02 --> 2293.56
it will just continue on

2289.24 --> 2296.74
like a big Nazi Empire that right if

2293.56 --> 2299.5
everybody resists it's it stops

2296.74 --> 2301.8999999999996
if people partially resist then it will

2299.5 --> 2304.839
slow down significantly if nobody

2301.9 --> 2307.48
resists then you can complain for the

2304.839 --> 2310.24
rest of your life nothing

2307.48 --> 2313.06
is gonna help you find Justice for what

2310.24 --> 2317.339
happened you understand there has to be

2313.06 --> 2320.2599999999998
a new Authority body that is uncorrupted

2317.339 --> 2323.38
try to imagine that in this age

2320.26 --> 2325.98
that can enforce it it has to first come

2323.38 --> 2325.98
into being

2338.44 --> 2342.64
why don't you try it out you piece of

2340.54 --> 2346.18
[ __ ] yes come back

2342.64 --> 2348.9
yeah why why didn't you try me

2346.18 --> 2348.8999999999996
[ __ ]

2351.64 --> 2357.54
I don't know you're just blabbering

2353.5 --> 2357.54
Bluster like all the trolls

2364.599 --> 2366.78
foreign

2399.0 --> 2404.099
hey Captain Caveman

2401.5 --> 2404.099
what's up

2420.339 --> 2424.9
dude yeah I know PJ khrushcheck like

2423.099 --> 2426.52
most of the people that do that sort of

2424.9 --> 2429.339
[ __ ] in chat

2426.52 --> 2432.839
they're like

2429.339 --> 2436.9
16 18 maybe like 25

2432.839 --> 2439.48
guys that are all freaking gay wussies

2436.9 --> 2441.88
that [ __ ] to everything and always end

2439.48 --> 2443.98
up just mumbling

2441.88 --> 2445.119
right in front of them like autist

2443.98 --> 2447.099
people

2445.119 --> 2449.38
because they're too afraid to actually

2447.099 --> 2452.2000000000003
face you when they talk about you right

2449.38 --> 2455.04
that's yeah keyboard Warriors I've met

2452.2 --> 2455.04
those types of people

2458.619 --> 2464.319
they would blabber on behind your back

2461.2 --> 2466.839
like like they expected you wouldn't

2464.319 --> 2469.24
hear them as if they were saying it in

2466.839 --> 2471.7
chat right even though they were audibly

2469.24 --> 2474.839
just saying it

2471.7 --> 2474.839
people are nuts

2484.92 --> 2490.42
Marta Fox Communities

2488.38 --> 2491.56
do whatever

2490.42 --> 2494.4
or

2491.56 --> 2494.4
girl whatever

2507.7 --> 2513.5989999999997
Riley's dog I did it

2510.52 --> 2513.599
I don't think so

2513.64 --> 2517.859
no Dan Winfield definitely didn't

2521.74 --> 2526.66
like if Riley's dog would have died I

2524.92 --> 2529.2400000000002
would know it he would tell everybody

2526.66 --> 2530.5
all heartbroken and you really lost that

2529.24 --> 2532.72
dog

2530.5 --> 2535.3
but no last time I heard he's actually

2532.72 --> 2538.4199999999996
completely recovered like he doesn't

2535.3 --> 2540.28
have any chronic issues anymore

2538.42 --> 2543.3
barely

2540.28 --> 2543.3
so don't worry

2552.22 --> 2557.2799999999997
words have meaning yeah yeah they do

2554.74 --> 2557.2799999999997
that's right

2584.5 --> 2587.5
foreign

2589.54 --> 2596.22
man I'm really loving this title card

2592.48 --> 2596.22
I'm very happy with it

2596.74 --> 2600.819
I love

2598.48 --> 2603.819
our cooperation

2600.819 --> 2606.9
Adam making in mine

2603.819 --> 2606.9
I really like this

2615.16 --> 2617.2799999999997
thank you

2635.2 --> 2639.8999999999996
there's absolutely no way this could be

2637.48 --> 2639.9
accurate

2640.72 --> 2644.819
right they can't believe it

2645.76 --> 2651.5400000000004
that's that was my first natural

2647.8 --> 2651.54
response like 20 years ago

2653.44 --> 2658.119
or more I don't know man

2656.2 --> 2660.9399999999996
people have tried to

2658.119 --> 2662.8
tell me a lot of times and I would like

2660.94 --> 2665.38
quickly forget about it because hey yeah

2662.8 --> 2667.42
bowling rain Supreme

2665.38 --> 2670.2400000000002
I really thought it was real even though

2667.42 --> 2672.76
I knew it was being constructed

2670.24 --> 2675.3999999999996
including by myself

2672.76 --> 2676.7200000000003
as I was going that it was that weird

2675.4 --> 2678.339
right

2676.72 --> 2681.819
but yeah it was a pretty serious ball

2678.339 --> 2684.04
believer like pretty religious but like

2681.819 --> 2686.2
under God it was a weird idea like the

2684.04 --> 2687.7
idea we have to create this reversed

2686.2 --> 2690.5789999999997
world

2687.7 --> 2692.5
thing to dream about

2690.579 --> 2695.619
as a challenge

2692.5 --> 2697.359
and to provide a leather staircase of

2695.619 --> 2700.06
consciousness

2697.359 --> 2704.0989999999997
that's what I thought as freaking ball

2700.06 --> 2704.099
when 20 years ago right

2704.92 --> 2710.8
it was religious

2707.68 --> 2712.5989999999997
and I did it also for God which I

2710.8 --> 2714.88
definitely believed really no matter

2712.599 --> 2717.04
what everybody would say yeah I'd heard

2714.88 --> 2720.3
people like oh God is dead or God is

2717.04 --> 2724.359
stupid it's all nonsense uh

2720.3 --> 2727.0600000000004
yeah sure like I'm not gonna argue with

2724.359 --> 2729.359
you but I'm definitely not gonna agree

2727.06 --> 2729.359
with you

2731.92 --> 2735.7000000000003
even though I would absolutely agree

2733.96 --> 2738.16
with the atheists if they start

2735.7 --> 2743.2
complaining about Christian religions

2738.16 --> 2743.2
people religious people yeah

2747.04 --> 2754.2599999999998
anyway this is all like me 20 years ago

2750.22 --> 2754.2599999999998
and you've never heard of me before

2757.72 --> 2761.2
it's more than 20 years ago it's more

2759.819 --> 2764.2599999999998
like

2761.2 --> 2767.02
25 years ago

2764.26 --> 2769.48
after 21 it like

2767.02 --> 2772.96
a lot of the original ball wind dream

2769.48 --> 2776.859
really broke because Baldwin

2772.96 --> 2779.619
was resting on the idea that he could

2776.859 --> 2781.72
integrate with like the entire Society

2779.619 --> 2784.9
it was in the time when it was still

2781.72 --> 2787.9599999999996
completely unwilling to accept

2784.9 --> 2790.48
how much darkness is in there and it's

2787.96 --> 2793.96
not gonna go away

2790.48 --> 2797.26
because as soon as that started to sink

2793.96 --> 2799.839
in pretty dramatically at first

2797.26 --> 2802.0600000000004
like it completely broke

2799.839 --> 2804.5789999999997
Baldwin's

2802.06 --> 2807.88
belief and that's when he became

2804.579 --> 2812.28
secondary and had to kind of climb

2807.88 --> 2812.28
to towards a new purpose in my life

2821.56 --> 2826.599
have the efforts of you being putting in

2824.68 --> 2829.56
the new title cards result in new

2826.599 --> 2834.7000000000003
increasing viewers and subs

2829.56 --> 2837.099
no well yes and no I have definitely

2834.7 --> 2839.3799999999997
gained increased viewership

2837.099 --> 2841.42
that was especially at the start it was

2839.38 --> 2844.48
very palpable

2841.42 --> 2847.059
like it has averaged the viewership

2844.48 --> 2850.96
on average has gone up

2847.059 --> 2853.8390000000004
30 to 50 percent sometimes like and

2850.96 --> 2855.579
peaked even Way Beyond over that

2853.839 --> 2858.94
but

2855.579 --> 2860.8590000000004
yeah the amount of Subs no is

2858.94 --> 2865.059
no

2860.859 --> 2868.619
that's just completely unaltered

2865.059 --> 2868.619
I'll check it out right now

2870.099 --> 2875.26
yep I got

2872.04 --> 2877.48
1960 subscribers

2875.26 --> 2880.119
right

2877.48 --> 2883.66
and sometimes it's

2880.119 --> 2885.819
59 and then it's 52 and then it goes

2883.66 --> 2887.319
back up and then goes back down and

2885.819 --> 2889.839
whatever

2887.319 --> 2894.72
it doesn't really go past that I haven't

2889.839 --> 2894.72
seen it go past the 1960 mark

2896.68 --> 2901.0789999999997
but yeah views have definitely gone up

2916.96 --> 2924.059
hey Tony Whitcomb are you

2920.26 --> 2924.059
responding to my title card

2924.28 --> 2927.8190000000004
yep

2926.079 --> 2929.2000000000003
because it's the first time I'm seeing

2927.819 --> 2932.2
you speak up

2929.2 --> 2934.24
welcome to chat you're kind of late but

2932.2 --> 2937.02
that's fine I'll still go at least

2934.24 --> 2937.02
another 10 minutes

2953.74 --> 2959.7999999999997
right plunder 23 your problem reaction

2956.38 --> 2962.98
solution well is it even still that you

2959.8 --> 2966.1600000000003
know this new rushed out roll system

2962.98 --> 2967.78
rolling out rushed system doesn't seem

2966.16 --> 2970.48
to be much of a problem reaction

2967.78 --> 2972.28
solution it's rather seems to be

2970.48 --> 2974.619
solution

2972.28 --> 2977.8590000000004
reaction problem

2974.619 --> 2979.7200000000003
right they give us the solution to a

2977.859 --> 2981.7
problem that literally does not exist

2979.72 --> 2983.3799999999997
that has to be conjured virtually

2981.7 --> 2987.3999999999996
completely

2983.38 --> 2991.7200000000003
the great effort and censorship

2987.4 --> 2995.2000000000003
then there's a response from the public

2991.72 --> 2997.18
and the solution literally creates the

2995.2 --> 2999.16
problem that literally was not there

2997.18 --> 3001.46
before

2999.16 --> 3004.94
right so it's more like a solution

3001.46 --> 3004.94
reaction problem

3012.18 --> 3018.18
quickly conjure a problem so the people

3015.3 --> 3020.76
will get this solution that will then

3018.18 --> 3022.6189999999997
actually create the problem that didn't

3020.76 --> 3024.3
exist before

3022.619 --> 3026.2200000000003
right and that's the title of my show

3024.3 --> 3029.819
pretty much

3026.22 --> 3031.85
isn't that just relevant now

3029.819 --> 3034.989
I'm so relevant

3031.85 --> 3034.989
[Music]

3040.06 --> 3044.119
[Music]

3046.98 --> 3049.16
foreign

3059.96 --> 3063.68
that sounds delicious

3068.46 --> 3072.619
hello James Mason good to see you

3077.16 --> 3081.54
right yeah Thomas eight nine five five

3079.38 --> 3084.7200000000003
but the thing is though

3081.54 --> 3086.599
yeah they can propose a new solution to

3084.72 --> 3089.7599999999998
the problem their previous solution cost

3086.599 --> 3092.579
the problem is though it's very likely

3089.76 --> 3094.2000000000003
that the new solution to the newly

3092.579 --> 3096.48
created problem

3094.2 --> 3098.5789999999997
is not going to solve the newly created

3096.48 --> 3101.16
problem and instead

3098.579 --> 3103.98
compound the situation further by

3101.16 --> 3106.2
creating even more problems on top of

3103.98 --> 3108.42
the newly created problems right

3106.2 --> 3110.7599999999998
there doesn't seem to be any hint that

3108.42 --> 3112.6800000000003
they are actually giving you a solution

3110.76 --> 3115.559
to anything

3112.68 --> 3117.4199999999996
they are only creating more problems

3115.559 --> 3120.7400000000002
effectively

3117.42 --> 3120.7400000000002
right and that's why

3120.96 --> 3127.619
the only solution that was there was at

3123.66 --> 3128.819
the start solution reaction problem

3127.619 --> 3131.46
right

3128.819 --> 3133.92
the only solution was at the start and

3131.46 --> 3135.839
the solution was don't buy into it don't

3133.92 --> 3136.98
take it and then you don't have the

3135.839 --> 3139.92
problem

3136.98 --> 3143.099
right that's the only part where there

3139.92 --> 3146.28
is a solution non-engagement do not buy

3143.099 --> 3147.48
into it under any circumstance no matter

3146.28 --> 3150.5400000000004
the cost

3147.48 --> 3152.04
and hey if that's gonna mean that you

3150.54 --> 3155.099
will be pushed

3152.04 --> 3157.319
and your natural law rights will be

3155.099 --> 3159.2400000000002
violated that somebody might end up

3157.319 --> 3164.0
trying to force it on you for whatever

3159.24 --> 3164.0
reason then kind of you have a

3164.04 --> 3170.2799999999997
human Duty

3165.96 --> 3171.9
I don't even know natural law duty to

3170.28 --> 3175.26
take out

3171.9 --> 3177.6800000000003
the one doing that to you

3175.26 --> 3177.6800000000003
right

3178.859 --> 3184.14
it's like a civil duty is it this could

3181.619 --> 3187.1600000000003
I call it a civil Duty what I just

3184.14 --> 3187.16
described I'm not sure

3187.8 --> 3190.46
foreign

3192.72 --> 3198.72
it's like it's supposed to be a civil

3196.079 --> 3201.6600000000003
Duty it's even like punishable

3198.72 --> 3203.5789999999997
under the law if you witness a crime

3201.66 --> 3206.64
that you report that crime to the police

3203.579 --> 3208.92
now of course all kinds of reasons why

3206.64 --> 3211.2
not to do that

3208.92 --> 3213.96
not always although when it's very

3211.2 --> 3216.66
egregious you definitely should

3213.96 --> 3218.579
right but with minor things yeah no

3216.66 --> 3221.94
issues

3218.579 --> 3223.92
so if that is kind of forced by law then

3221.94 --> 3226.26
shouldn't you do the same thing when

3223.92 --> 3228.54
it's literally cultists or groups or

3226.26 --> 3230.1600000000003
even if it includes police officers that

3228.54 --> 3232.5589999999997
have bought into the cup

3230.16 --> 3234.8999999999996
are literally going to violate your

3232.559 --> 3238.3190000000004
human rights

3234.9 --> 3240.7200000000003
isn't it a duty to respond properly to

3238.319 --> 3241.859
that as well and not let them roll over

3240.72 --> 3243.7799999999997
you

3241.859 --> 3247.98
right

3243.78 --> 3250.1400000000003
so is it is it a civil Duty

3247.98 --> 3251.16
to physically defend yourself against

3250.14 --> 3254.94
that

3251.16 --> 3257.22
I would say yes but I don't know if it

3254.94 --> 3259.98
officially could be considered that

3257.22 --> 3262.14
I'm certainly considering it

3259.98 --> 3264.859
as such

3262.14 --> 3264.859
uh

3284.99 --> 3288.0899999999997
[Music]

3293.46 --> 3298.68
called Debbie you're still controller to

3296.099 --> 3301.5
enthusia dude it can be used for all

3298.68 --> 3303.0589999999997
kinds of things dude directed energy

3301.5 --> 3305.7
weapons

3303.059 --> 3307.619
can literally be used to totally

3305.7 --> 3310.2599999999998
disintegrate

3307.619 --> 3312.96
metal and rock

3310.26 --> 3314.3390000000004
not Mountain disintegrate right well if

3312.96 --> 3317.76
they can do that they could pretty much

3314.339 --> 3320.22
do anything conceivable with that

3317.76 --> 3322.38
they can literally just make you explode

3320.22 --> 3324.66
on the spot they could literally mind

3322.38 --> 3326.94
wipe you or certainly out of nowhere

3324.66 --> 3332.18
like dude

3326.94 --> 3332.18
that Tech can do literally anything

3335.94 --> 3339.9
right

3337.14 --> 3341.2799999999997
just as much as there is like resonance

3339.9 --> 3345.9
technology

3341.28 --> 3348.119
to fix body issues and even disease

3345.9 --> 3349.7400000000002
conditions through by applying very

3348.119 --> 3354.42
specific resonance

3349.74 --> 3356.7599999999998
like that it's very underappreciated

3354.42 --> 3358.819
but it can technically heal anything

3356.76 --> 3363.3590000000004
right well

3358.819 --> 3366.7799999999997
d e w weapons are kind of based on the

3363.359 --> 3373.2799999999997
same concept except weaponized

3366.78 --> 3373.28
it can damage alter manipulate anything

3374.339 --> 3380.5789999999997
the potential is dare I say unlimited

3378.0 --> 3381.599
and it's extremely dangerous because of

3380.579 --> 3384.0
that

3381.599 --> 3385.92
now that's not a guarantee that it will

3384.0 --> 3387.9
be a blight because it's going to be

3385.92 --> 3391.98
pretty dramatic

3387.9 --> 3393.839
right and anything dramatic is going to

3391.98 --> 3396.059
cause nervousness it's going to cause

3393.839 --> 3397.14
Restless it's gonna cause loss of

3396.059 --> 3398.579
control

3397.14 --> 3401.8799999999997
but

3398.579 --> 3403.92
yeah subtle influences for sure

3401.88 --> 3406.859
I mean I think they could probably get

3403.92 --> 3408.599
away with applying it in a subtle way to

3406.859 --> 3411.7799999999997
just kind of

3408.599 --> 3414.42
make suggestions drop in your mind like

3411.78 --> 3417.119
a third voice from the outside to kind

3414.42 --> 3419.64
of like nudge people psychologically

3417.119 --> 3421.1400000000003
towards a certain direction like they

3419.64 --> 3423.1189999999997
could try that

3421.14 --> 3425.819
and then it's very likely that people

3423.119 --> 3428.4
that are weaker in mind they're very

3425.819 --> 3430.079
easily to go along to get along that

3428.4 --> 3432.299
they will fall for it when the people

3430.079 --> 3434.1600000000003
that have critical thought will rather

3432.299 --> 3437.46
experience like wait there's something

3434.16 --> 3438.839
wrong here I feel

3437.46 --> 3440.94
weird

3438.839 --> 3442.619
right and they won't do that because

3440.94 --> 3444.299
they have principles they have critical

3442.619 --> 3447.54
thought they have stronger Spirit

3444.299 --> 3450.18
they're much more aware of tampering

3447.54 --> 3452.9
even in the energy field

3450.18 --> 3452.8999999999996
so

3453.42 --> 3460.619
yeah

3455.819 --> 3462.42
I'll bet you do d-e-w

3460.619 --> 3467.119
eaponry

3462.42 --> 3467.119
it's not gonna go away anytime soon

3468.0 --> 3474.299
and I bet that especially like

3470.7 --> 3477.9199999999996
highly secret operations will start

3474.299 --> 3477.92
utilizing them more and more

3482.16 --> 3486.359
I don't really like to think about it it

3484.38 --> 3488.2200000000003
is really so it's such a potential

3486.359 --> 3491.7
Danger

3488.22 --> 3493.74
it's dangerous enough to make Alex Jones

3491.7 --> 3495.7799999999997
If he if you get him to think about it

3493.74 --> 3497.7
to get a complete and utter meltdown

3495.78 --> 3500.42
because it is that freaking dangerous

3497.7 --> 3500.4199999999996
potentially

3520.38 --> 3524.819
presence in the body has an effect on

3522.48 --> 3526.7400000000002
others as well yes it does that's just

3524.819 --> 3529.88
what we experience as the spirit

3526.74 --> 3533.22
resonating and this is in my opinion

3529.88 --> 3536.04
it's a suspicion I see the strong

3533.22 --> 3539.4599999999996
correlations this is also what causes

3536.04 --> 3541.38
vaccinated people to supposedly shed on

3539.46 --> 3543.54
family members on people they are around

3541.38 --> 3545.6400000000003
all day especially if they sympathize

3543.54 --> 3548.22
with them if they have an emotional

3545.64 --> 3550.68
spiritual connections

3548.22 --> 3552.359
which most people thankfully still do

3550.68 --> 3555.799
with their family

3552.359 --> 3559.68
that through that energy connection

3555.799 --> 3563.7
the bizarre influences of the vaccine

3559.68 --> 3565.02
start to Echo onto the non-factor

3563.7 --> 3568.16
recipient

3565.02 --> 3570.119
and that's how they catch it

3568.16 --> 3572.339
psychosomatically basically that that

3570.119 --> 3576.059
was the previous

3572.339 --> 3576.9
word description that I would assign to

3576.059 --> 3579.119
it

3576.9 --> 3581.76
but yes I think it is very much about

3579.119 --> 3583.6800000000003
resonance not about oh there's this

3581.76 --> 3586.7400000000002
particles being created in the

3583.68 --> 3588.7799999999997
vaccinated and they fly more on the

3586.74 --> 3590.819
other person and that's how they get the

3588.78 --> 3594.7200000000003
disease now that model is complete

3590.819 --> 3599.2799999999997
horseshit yeah that doesn't exist it it

3594.72 --> 3601.74
doesn't work that way do these shatters

3599.28 --> 3605.099
people that have been infected by

3601.74 --> 3608.7599999999998
shedding of close family members do they

3605.099 --> 3610.619
pass it on as they are in the sickness

3608.76 --> 3614.099
condition and then they are with other

3610.619 --> 3616.26
people do they actually does it continue

3614.099 --> 3619.7400000000002
or doesn't it

3616.26 --> 3622.3190000000004
does it require the presence of a

3619.74 --> 3625.9199999999996
vaccinated person to have that effect

3622.319 --> 3628.799
right this is something to look out for

3625.92 --> 3632.819
very carefully to figure out what that

3628.799 --> 3635.4
is and not buy into the virus model

3632.819 --> 3638.22
based shedding concept

3635.4 --> 3640.02
because they are trying to make it again

3638.22 --> 3642.8999999999996
about viruses

3640.02 --> 3646.14
which nothing

3642.9 --> 3649.099
has to do with that really

3646.14 --> 3649.0989999999997
none of it does

3658.44 --> 3662.7000000000003
hmm

3660.0 --> 3665.28
that's a good one Thomas 8955 didn't

3662.7 --> 3667.3799999999997
Copernicus say that the model was wasn't

3665.28 --> 3669.7200000000003
made to explain constitute reality but

3667.38 --> 3671.339
simply the model for The Luminaries

3669.72 --> 3676.0789999999997
yes

3671.339 --> 3678.38
in a way Copernicus probably still

3676.079 --> 3682.6800000000003
functioned under the

3678.38 --> 3685.1400000000003
since forgotten understanding maybe this

3682.68 --> 3687.0589999999997
is my speculation he might have known

3685.14 --> 3689.16
the globe of the heavens is purely

3687.059 --> 3691.26
holographic and he was simply modeling

3689.16 --> 3692.94
and then later it all got physically

3691.26 --> 3696.0200000000004
reified

3692.94 --> 3696.02
but he might have known

3706.38 --> 3710.339
but yeah those are interesting types of

3708.54 --> 3712.44
questions

3710.339 --> 3714.299
right

3712.44 --> 3716.16
it's like don't over generalize things

3714.299 --> 3718.68
it's just like oh these Ballers you're

3716.16 --> 3721.799
talking about Newtonian gravity

3718.68 --> 3723.8999999999996
uh Stupid Newton and then you actually

3721.799 --> 3726.0
look into Newton's work and you'll find

3723.9 --> 3729.599
that he wrote a letter about how he

3726.0 --> 3732.0
absolutely did not claim a hypothesis to

3729.599 --> 3734.52
gravitation because he thought that was

3732.0 --> 3737.28
absolutely ridiculous that somebody

3734.52 --> 3742.02
could believe that to be literal to be

3737.28 --> 3744.9
scientific right so don't downplay these

3742.02 --> 3747.0
people that are grafted into this crazy

3744.9 --> 3750.299
ball are called narrative

3747.0 --> 3752.52
right check out who they were a lot of

3750.299 --> 3753.96
these people that have basically done

3752.52 --> 3756.96
the development that are now

3753.96 --> 3759.2400000000002
standardized in the globe religion

3756.96 --> 3761.96
they did not necessarily agree with the

3759.24 --> 3761.9599999999996
globe religion

3762.42 --> 3764.9
right

3766.98 --> 3772.559
I'm sure some of them were

3769.319 --> 3775.98
like Cavendish for example he was

3772.559 --> 3778.98
absolutely in on it he had to be

3775.98 --> 3782.46
too much machination in his work

3778.98 --> 3785.22
right there's so much machination

3782.46 --> 3787.44
in there you know

3785.22 --> 3788.2799999999997
they are in on the globe religion they

3787.44 --> 3791.9
know

3788.28 --> 3791.9
what they're doing is Imagination

3796.14 --> 3801.72
but don't just blame anybody that got

3799.98 --> 3803.28
stuck with their work in the

3801.72 --> 3806.0
heliocentric

3803.28 --> 3806.0
religion

3815.16 --> 3821.22
exactly Thomas 8955

3818.819 --> 3823.079
and I always like to remind people about

3821.22 --> 3825.7799999999997
that I love it

3823.079 --> 3829.46
also made me have a lot more respect for

3825.78 --> 3832.7400000000002
Newton like like I still think him as a

3829.46 --> 3835.14
respectful historical figure for

3832.74 --> 3837.18
everything he's done and yes I know like

3835.14 --> 3839.819
the Newtonian model it's only a model

3837.18 --> 3844.0989999999997
it's a concept that excludes

3839.819 --> 3844.099
gas behavior in the model

3844.26 --> 3849.559
but yeah it was still interesting and

3850.5 --> 3857.119
and he seemed like just yeah it doesn't

3853.559 --> 3857.119
seem like a bad person to me

3860.94 --> 3870.78
right he didn't marry his cousin twice

3866.099 --> 3870.78
he wasn't like a sodomite creep

3871.38 --> 3878.579
wasn't like darwini darwinist

3874.859 --> 3880.5789999999997
right no he was a Christian and he was a

3878.579 --> 3884.039
bit of an occultist was very much

3880.579 --> 3887.039
digging into occultism too

3884.039 --> 3890.48
but he was in the core of a Christian he

3887.039 --> 3890.48
was out to figure out the truth

3908.099 --> 3913.799
yeah but PJ krishank you know

3910.92 --> 3916.5
it the ball religion Globe religion

3913.799 --> 3918.119
isn't even Helios entered is not Sun

3916.5 --> 3919.559
worship

3918.119 --> 3921.1800000000003
right

3919.559 --> 3924.599
now it's

3921.18 --> 3927.5989999999997
nothing worse yet it's the worship of

3924.599 --> 3930.299
the vacuum of space and being

3927.599 --> 3933.2400000000002
an insignificant little nothing within

3930.299 --> 3936.42
it that's the real worship the worship

3933.24 --> 3939.1189999999997
is the void it's void worship it doesn't

3936.42 --> 3942.0
actually worship the sun even the sun

3939.119 --> 3944.94
our sun is insignificant

3942.0 --> 3947.4
within the entire model yeah do you

3944.94 --> 3949.38
understand there's so many bigger Sons

3947.4 --> 3952.079
Etc it says just a stupid little blip on

3949.38 --> 3954.96
an outskirt of a galaxy that's not even

3952.079 --> 3957.7200000000003
the only Galaxy it's just one Galaxy a

3954.96 --> 3960.18
thousand galaxies which are in an over

3957.72 --> 3962.3999999999996
Galaxy and an even bigger right it's

3960.18 --> 3965.819
also insignificant including the Sun so

3962.4 --> 3966.78
it's modern heliocentrism as we call it

3965.819 --> 3970.44
now

3966.78 --> 3974.039
isn't really Sun worship it's void

3970.44 --> 3977.16
worship the worship of nothing of

3974.039 --> 3979.38
nihilism meaninglessness that's what it

3977.16 --> 3982.2
really is and that's what makes it so

3979.38 --> 3985.319
satanic really when you think about it

3982.2 --> 3987.24
worship the sun right the sun is

3985.319 --> 3989.46
freaking awesome

3987.24 --> 3992.819
right

3989.46 --> 3995.039
yet to worship it as some kind of a God

3992.819 --> 3998.579
would be kind of like

3995.039 --> 4000.079
a little Earthly right wouldn't it's

3998.579 --> 4002.7200000000003
advised against

4000.079 --> 4005.7200000000003
but that's not what Helia Centris do

4002.72 --> 4008.0589999999997
right they don't worship the sun let's

4005.72 --> 4011.5989999999997
get honest here no

4008.059 --> 4014.0
originally they just placed the sun in a

4011.599 --> 4015.619
basic little model of close by thing

4014.0 --> 4017.72
supposedly

4015.619 --> 4019.2200000000003
and then said oh no it's not revolving

4017.72 --> 4021.3799999999997
around the earth it's revolving around

4019.22 --> 4023.839
the Sun that's really the only thing

4021.38 --> 4025.28
that makes it heliocentric it's just one

4023.839 --> 4028.16
little thing

4025.28 --> 4029.48
that doesn't make the entire Globe

4028.16 --> 4031.5789999999997
religion

4029.48 --> 4032.359
sudden more shipping that's just not

4031.579 --> 4035.8390000000004
true

4032.359 --> 4038.5989999999997
right it's void worshiping the

4035.839 --> 4041.72
worshiping of insignificance

4038.599 --> 4043.6400000000003
and meaninglessness

4041.72 --> 4046.1189999999997
that's what it really is think about it

4043.64 --> 4046.1189999999997
carefully

4049.96 --> 4053.15
[Music]

4056.66 --> 4064.0989999999997
right I mean these freaks don't even are

4060.26 --> 4067.2200000000003
not even willing to recognize

4064.099 --> 4069.7400000000002
that everything is designed because it

4067.22 --> 4071.7799999999997
can only be designed they are not even

4069.74 --> 4075.5789999999997
willing to

4071.78 --> 4075.579
accept that right

4082.039 --> 4088.6600000000003
so it's void worship worship of

4084.74 --> 4088.66
meaninglessness and insignificance

4094.52 --> 4100.839
right I'll be back two minutes again and

4097.58 --> 4100.839
then I'm gonna run out of the show

4102.08 --> 4104.92
foreign

4170.54 --> 4173.54
foreign

4182.92 --> 4187.819
work on the streets yeah yeah I've seen

4185.6 --> 4191.679
some of that he also got on the ball

4187.819 --> 4191.679
business panel yesterday that was fun

4228.62 --> 4233.239
right yeah getting wisdom that you yeah

4231.739 --> 4235.58
a lot of it

4233.239 --> 4238.82
is exactly that

4235.58 --> 4242.0599999999995
one example and to me this was kind of

4238.82 --> 4245.239
unveiled by Owen Benjamin but he's not

4242.06 --> 4247.88
the inventor of it I think

4245.239 --> 4249.5599999999995
and I think that maybe in the far past I

4247.88 --> 4252.32
have been confronted with the concept

4249.56 --> 4254.2390000000005
before and I marveled over it and then I

4252.32 --> 4256.759999999999
forgot about it and that is that the

4254.239 --> 4258.98
story of evolution

4256.76 --> 4261.26
is actually

4258.98 --> 4263.5
a

4261.26 --> 4265.659000000001
I can

4263.5 --> 4268.699
anthropomorphization or a

4265.659 --> 4270.86
literalification of a process that does

4268.699 --> 4273.5599999999995
actually happen

4270.86 --> 4276.259999999999
and it has everything to do with

4273.56 --> 4279.38
procreation and birth

4276.26 --> 4282.92
right the Big Bang having sex

4279.38 --> 4285.38
then the Ooze being struck by lightning

4282.92 --> 4288.7390000000005
like

4285.38 --> 4291.08
yeah that could be like the spark flying

4288.739 --> 4295.218999999999
between man and woman

4291.08 --> 4297.08
and then oh the evolution cycle from one

4295.219 --> 4300.14
cell splitting up becoming multiple

4297.08 --> 4303.679
cells then turning into like a fish

4300.14 --> 4306.26
a bird like all these weird little

4303.679 --> 4308.9
morphic stages within the development of

4306.26 --> 4312.92
the fetus right

4308.9 --> 4315.86
I thought that was absolutely brilliant

4312.92 --> 4317.2390000000005
so the story of evolution that includes

4315.86 --> 4319.219
the Big Bang

4317.239 --> 4322.58
could actually be completely

4319.219 --> 4324.9800000000005
metaphorical and not literal but it

4322.58 --> 4327.26
can't be literal's complete nonsense but

4324.98 --> 4329.78
as a metaphorical thing yeah it pretty

4327.26 --> 4332.7390000000005
accurately represents the

4329.78 --> 4332.739
procreation

4334.1 --> 4337.96
it's astounding when you think about it

4343.159 --> 4345.58
right

4345.8 --> 4347.9800000000005
foreign

4348.739 --> 4353.959999999999
but yeah it is Imagination Big Bang

4351.739 --> 4355.94
story of evolution it is a machination

4353.96 --> 4359.12
it is a

4355.94 --> 4361.5199999999995
a weird literalization

4359.12 --> 4363.32
of another process that is very

4361.52 --> 4366.320000000001
miraculous and

4363.32 --> 4366.32
and Universal

4379.1 --> 4383.54
yes PJ creshenko well that's a lot of

4381.86 --> 4389.5599999999995
people do that right

4383.54 --> 4389.56
and there is such worship it does exist

4390.199 --> 4394.0
in a lot of like occultism

4394.76 --> 4401.0
right but that's not what like the

4397.54 --> 4404.179
heliocentric belief is it's not literal

4401.0 --> 4406.58
Sun worship but it effectively causes is

4404.179 --> 4408.14
void worship the worship of

4406.58 --> 4411.5599999999995
insignificance oh it doesn't mean

4408.14 --> 4414.320000000001
anything the random chance

4411.56 --> 4415.820000000001
right oh it's just like oh it could all

4414.32 --> 4418.34
be gone just like that it doesn't mean

4415.82 --> 4420.799999999999
anything that's really the Cornerstone

4418.34 --> 4423.32
that's where it all comes down to

4420.8 --> 4424.96
right so it's not about oh the sun is

4423.32 --> 4427.58
everything the sun no no no no no no

4424.96 --> 4430.1
suddenly even it's like insignificant

4427.58 --> 4433.179
just another stupid little blip in the

4430.1 --> 4433.179
endless universe right

4439.4 --> 4443.239
so yeah good

4441.5 --> 4445.64
