the weather today

96.96 --> 102.32
i don't know

99.36 --> 105.52
it was a lot more cloudy earlier so this

102.32 --> 108.39899999999999
is kind of unexpected this

105.52 --> 108.399
patch of blue

110.0 --> 115.84
certainly

111.439 --> 115.83999999999999
cleared up it happened very quickly

120.64 --> 125.04
it's just there's a lot of haze up there

122.88 --> 125.03999999999999
like

125.52 --> 129.28
i don't know maybe i didn't really pay a

127.759 --> 133.28
lot of attention

129.28 --> 133.28
until now to the sky but

135.92 --> 141.48
maybe these were clouds and they kind of

138.16 --> 141.48
like dissolved

142.319 --> 144.79999999999998
i don't know

144.879 --> 149.2
but yeah right now it's nice and sunny

149.52 --> 153.04000000000002
it's mostly wind still

153.36 --> 157.56
but it's still kind of cool

159.04 --> 165.2
i'll see i'll check the temperature

162.959 --> 168.64000000000001
hello america silver patriot first in

but yeah it's october so come on anyway

200.319 --> 203.76
right

201.68 --> 207.12
oh i got up really late today that's

203.76 --> 207.12
also why i started a little late

208.0 --> 212.4
when my alarm clock went off at 11

210.239 --> 213.12
o'clock i was

212.4 --> 215.84
i

213.12 --> 217.04
was already woken up 15 minutes before

215.84 --> 219.28
that

217.04 --> 222.4
but then i just realized like i really

219.28 --> 224.84
wanted to sleep out a little

222.4 --> 227.92000000000002
and i did that

224.84 --> 229.20000000000002
but because of that i woke up a half

227.92 --> 232.07999999999998
hour before

229.2 --> 232.07999999999998
starting the show

232.159 --> 236.39999999999998
but i do feel

234.319 --> 240.599
just well rested

236.4 --> 240.59900000000002
anyway hello gadget inspector

251.519 --> 255.239
mercia yeah

258.16 --> 260.47900000000004
so

263.28 --> 269.03999999999996
what was going on yesterday

266.8 --> 271.199
right so yeah for starters yesterday's

269.04 --> 274.24
show

271.199 --> 276.639
yesterday show was very

274.24 --> 276.639
tense

279.04 --> 283.32
i went at it pretty hard

285.919 --> 293.56
i was sick with the flu okay

289.28 --> 293.55999999999995
well welcome back guys inspector

302.72 --> 305.199
all right

308.24 --> 313.52
right right right yeah yesterday

311.039 --> 315.68
made by jim bob was live and i did catch

313.52 --> 318.96
his show

315.68 --> 318.96
it was very interesting

321.919 --> 327.35999999999996
talking about the spirit mechanics of

324.08 --> 329.51
idolatry very interesting

327.36 --> 332.66
right

329.51 --> 332.65999999999997
[Music]

333.759 --> 339.039
of course

335.12 --> 340.96
yeah nathan oakley's the premiere

339.039 --> 341.759
that was recorded on

340.96 --> 344.15999999999997
sun

341.759 --> 346.40000000000003
no wait on friday it was very good very

344.16 --> 346.40000000000003
long

346.639 --> 351.479
i certainly enjoyed watching that back

352.639 --> 357.759
uh let's see what else

355.759 --> 359.36
there's not a lot of live streams on my

357.759 --> 361.68
list

359.36 --> 361.68
right

364.72 --> 372.0
oh right somebody in skype linked me up

368.72 --> 372.0
to glow busters

372.479 --> 378.24
some weird stuff going on there

375.759 --> 383.039
well weird it just felt weird

378.24 --> 383.039
because they were just like playing

383.12 --> 387.6
flat side video

385.44 --> 389.44
with his music so it was like very

387.6 --> 392.16
recognizable

389.44 --> 394.71999999999997
and yeah nathan oakley

392.16 --> 395.759
was in those videos

394.72 --> 398.319
as well

395.759 --> 401.68
that was just weird like they were

398.319 --> 404.72
like using the video anyway

401.68 --> 406.84000000000003
i guess he was trying to be

404.72 --> 411.199
doing it in a positive

406.84 --> 411.19899999999996
light it's just weird

417.12 --> 420.16
so yeah that happened

421.12 --> 424.88
it's just strange to hear like nathan

423.44 --> 428.0
oakley clips

424.88 --> 428.0
on glow busters

430.4 --> 434.4
and like he was not there live neither

432.639 --> 437.84000000000003
was flat they were just playing one of

434.4 --> 437.84
flat so it's videos

438.0 --> 441.28
i'm giving commentary

447.36 --> 451.91900000000004
ah hey yeah catch you respect yeah i was

449.599 --> 454.4
on mitchell from australia last friday

451.919 --> 456.24
and it was very it was great

454.4 --> 459.35999999999996
i haven't watched the whole thing back

456.24 --> 462.16
but just the first half hour it was good

459.36 --> 462.16
although yeah

462.4 --> 466.87899999999996
it was a little stumbly

465.28 --> 468.87899999999996
don't like that

466.879 --> 471.28000000000003
but yeah i guess that you guys don't

468.879 --> 472.319
mind and mitchell just carried carried

471.28 --> 474.15999999999997
it through

472.319 --> 477.16
very eloquently

474.16 --> 477.16
uh

480.479 --> 485.24
hey james mason good morning

496.8 --> 501.919
did you see what the top google answer

500.16 --> 506.0
is

501.919 --> 506.79999999999995
if you type is gravity a theory

506.0 --> 508.16
no

506.8 --> 510.639
no actually

508.16 --> 510.639
i haven't

512.399 --> 518.88
i guess i'll try it out

514.809 --> 523.039
[Music]

518.88 --> 523.039
it's a theory not a fact huh

526.88 --> 531.8389999999999
i guess they mean colloquial theory

530.59 --> 533.9200000000001
[Music]

531.839 --> 537.0400000000001
this material should be approached with

533.92 --> 537.04
an open mind oh

541.68 --> 546.2399999999999
not even to mention universal theory of

543.839 --> 550.1600000000001
gravity gravity is often taught in

546.24 --> 553.92
schools as a fact when in fact it is not

550.16 --> 556.399
even a good theory wow they added that

553.92 --> 556.399
all right

560.56 --> 564.959
yeah that that's unexpected

565.6 --> 570.9590000000001
let me share that with you

568.72 --> 573.9590000000001
alright so yeah that's actually what it

570.959 --> 573.959
said

588.839 --> 594.48
huh that's interesting

592.24 --> 596.64
and well technically correct although

594.48 --> 598.9590000000001
yeah theory is used in a colloquial

596.64 --> 598.959
sense

602.0 --> 605.519
because

602.959 --> 607.76
yeah if

605.519 --> 611.2
if it is a theory

607.76 --> 613.519
then it should have scientific backing

611.2 --> 614.8000000000001
and to then say it is a theory but not a

613.519 --> 617.04
fact is

614.8 --> 620.3199999999999
yeah does contradict that

617.04 --> 622.3199999999999
unless you unmentioned

620.32 --> 624.5600000000001
unless you just simply forget to mention

622.32 --> 626.1600000000001
that it's a colloquial theory

624.56 --> 627.3599999999999
but yeah that's

626.16 --> 631.36
not

627.36 --> 634.8000000000001
that's not really an integrated approach

631.36 --> 634.8000000000001
for the word just yet

635.279 --> 638.8
in wider language use

639.44 --> 644.72
so i guess you could call that like

643.12 --> 647.839
an academic

644.72 --> 647.839
critical approach

650.24 --> 655.72
interesting anyway yeah thanks for

652.16 --> 655.7199999999999
bringing that up

674.88 --> 680.32
hey gaining wisdom good to see you

677.6 --> 680.32
timothy p

681.44 --> 685.839
hello

682.959 --> 689.8389999999999
global mcglobe face

685.839 --> 689.839
try reading your source what

706.0 --> 711.2
oh that is kind of funny that you're

708.24 --> 711.2
dude stop it

711.68 --> 719.279
the key sentence there is this satirical

717.12 --> 721.76
what

719.279 --> 724.32
what i'll do that is

721.76 --> 727.04
evolution

724.32 --> 727.0400000000001
a theory

727.76 --> 733.68
i was both fact in theory oh well they

730.48 --> 733.6800000000001
didn't got that one wrong

738.399 --> 743.72
major patterns of change

740.639 --> 743.72
all right

745.279 --> 750.32
yeah it still goes to show

747.36 --> 750.32
google is not

751.279 --> 758.4399999999999
like a bottom line

753.68 --> 758.4399999999999
source that gets everything right

758.56 --> 763.279
but i guess they are now reconsidering

761.68 --> 768.04
gravity

763.279 --> 768.04
in the in a more public way

772.8 --> 777.279
just quoting the article that i showed

778.399 --> 782.76
i wasn't digging into an article

785.93 --> 789.76
[Music]

788.399 --> 792.399
no no

789.76 --> 792.399
you're wrong

792.88 --> 800.16
i'm sorry i showed it right that wasn't

796.079 --> 801.519
an article it was simply

800.16 --> 804.8
what google

801.519 --> 804.8
said themselves

806.56 --> 811.079
it's like the the top result

825.199 --> 830.399
right

826.079 --> 830.399
that that usually means

830.48 --> 835.36
if they

831.44 --> 838.1600000000001
literally highlight a piece of text

835.36 --> 842.0790000000001
that google kind of backs it

838.16 --> 842.37
otherwise they just show the link

842.079 --> 843.5999999999999
and

842.37 --> 847.44
[Music]

843.6 --> 847.44
you'd have to dig into it yourself

850.079 --> 855.2399999999999
right they place the text underneath it

861.68 --> 866.959
so i disagree with you there global

864.079 --> 866.959
globe face

867.44 --> 871.5600000000001
what kind of name is that

879.279 --> 884.399
yeah they do show delay i know

881.519 --> 885.76
i know i'm not disputing that cps i'm

884.399 --> 888.32
just saying

885.76 --> 892.079
when they show the text

888.32 --> 892.0790000000001
directly under the search bar

894.88 --> 899.36
when they show that that usually implies

898.56 --> 901.5999999999999
that

899.36 --> 905.44
like google

901.6 --> 905.44
stands behind the statement

905.68 --> 910.199
like that is their official choice

912.639 --> 916.5600000000001
but maybe

913.76 --> 920.079
that's not what it is

916.56 --> 921.3599999999999
but that's kind of how i've taken that

920.079 --> 923.5999999999999
they

921.36 --> 926.32
show piece of text above

923.6 --> 929.0400000000001
any link source that and they put it on

926.32 --> 931.839
top that kind of implies that this is

929.04 --> 934.639
what google says about it

931.839 --> 937.1990000000001
they move behind

934.639 --> 939.6800000000001
those that statement

937.199 --> 943.519
which is then from the source and

939.68 --> 943.519
sometimes they don't even show a source

946.04 --> 949.169
[Music]

949.92 --> 955.04
shout out to meat

952.24 --> 958.399
by jim rob protesting

955.04 --> 958.399
meat budget you mean

960.16 --> 964.88
made by jim bob

961.68 --> 964.88
not meat by gmo

965.12 --> 970.639
yeah yeah he was talking about that

967.6 --> 972.9590000000001
a jim bob talks about a lot of

970.639 --> 972.9590000000001
things

974.399 --> 980.399
like debate flat earth debate subjects

977.279 --> 982.8
and like literally addresses

980.399 --> 984.639
nathan oakley and quantum eraser so he

982.8 --> 989.04
is like with us

984.639 --> 989.04
i haven't like he hasn't shown up yet

989.12 --> 995.24
on the show in the panel but he might

991.519 --> 995.24
not be up for that

999.759 --> 1003.839
but he's definitely following

1001.92 --> 1006.88
it's interesting and he's also like

1003.839 --> 1010.1600000000001
almost very interested in studying

1006.88 --> 1011.519
anti-flood earther and global psychology

1010.16 --> 1014.079
and

1011.519 --> 1016.8
concerning that

1014.079 --> 1018.7199999999999
like it's really interesting for me too

1016.8 --> 1020.3199999999999
to be in this chat i have a lot of

1018.72 --> 1022.839
experience with it

1020.32 --> 1026.48
that i can then condense in what i'm

1022.839 --> 1029.199
saying and he does it live so it's for

1026.48 --> 1032.16
me it's very interesting streams to

1029.199 --> 1032.16
to sit through life

1032.4 --> 1037.6000000000001
made by jim bob great channel on youtube

1035.679 --> 1041.039
and it's kind of like my show it's just

1037.6 --> 1041.039
him on camera talking

1041.36 --> 1046.9199999999998
interacting with jet

1043.56 --> 1046.9199999999998
[Music]

1049.44 --> 1053.6000000000001
but he also does like political cartoons

1052.08 --> 1056.6399999999999
and all that

1053.6 --> 1058.6399999999999
and he's tied into the

1056.64 --> 1061.2800000000002
the owen benjamin

1058.64 --> 1061.2800000000002
website

1065.44 --> 1068.72
low stone monkey 3d

1076.96 --> 1080.64
oh oh

1078.72 --> 1083.919
i think i triggered a couple of globers

1080.64 --> 1083.919
here through that result

1084.72 --> 1088.48
so you're now in my chat telling me

1087.2 --> 1091.28
telling us

1088.48 --> 1093.76
the flat earthers pj crew shank

1091.28 --> 1094.8799999999999
like oh why don't you google the other

1093.76 --> 1098.0
things

1094.88 --> 1100.72
where google all agrees with us

1098.0 --> 1103.2
yeah that's not what this is about

1100.72 --> 1105.679
this is not about some claim like oh

1103.2 --> 1107.52
google is switching to become more like

1105.679 --> 1109.6000000000001
flat earthers no that's not what this

1107.52 --> 1111.76
was about it was simply

1109.6 --> 1113.6
a little

1111.76 --> 1116.16
detail

1113.6 --> 1117.039
that came to the attention

1116.16 --> 1119.1200000000001
right

1117.039 --> 1123.28
doesn't mean google's not on your side

1119.12 --> 1128.28
anymore globers don't worry

1123.28 --> 1128.28
your consensus isn't still in place

1136.4 --> 1141.44
what

1138.0 --> 1141.44
james mason what

1145.2 --> 1151.2
what are you talking about

1148.32 --> 1154.3999999999999
hey ralph rodriguez i triggered the ai

1151.2 --> 1157.28
bots i don't think they're ai bots

1154.4 --> 1157.2800000000002
alfred there you guys

1160.88 --> 1163.6000000000001
hey i bought

1162.24 --> 1167.1200000000001
yeah

1163.6 --> 1167.12
behave very differently

1167.42 --> 1170.64
[Music]

1169.28 --> 1174.8799999999999
right

1170.64 --> 1179.3200000000002
when i referenced the ai the other day

1174.88 --> 1179.3200000000002
i wasn't talking about bots

1179.52 --> 1187.36
i was talking about study like the ai

1183.36 --> 1187.36
that studies all information

1188.48 --> 1191.3600000000001
right that's not

1190.0 --> 1193.36
that doesn't mean that they're going to

1191.36 --> 1197.36
be like good at

1193.36 --> 1201.76
making a realistic bot

1197.36 --> 1201.76
that the ai can do that no no that

1203.6 --> 1211.1999999999998
now bots at best are used for trolling

1208.799 --> 1214.1589999999999
or for yeah for

1211.2 --> 1216.559
fooling really simple people that just

1214.159 --> 1219.0390000000002
can't see through it that that don't

1216.559 --> 1221.9189999999999
feel the repetitiveness effect and just

1219.039 --> 1223.12
the unnaturalness to how they

1221.919 --> 1224.88
reply

1223.12 --> 1227.84
right if they're not good at spotting

1224.88 --> 1229.2800000000002
that then those people will be caught up

1227.84 --> 1230.1589999999999
with them

1229.28 --> 1232.0
that's

1230.159 --> 1234.0
the best

1232.0 --> 1236.24
it yeah that's the best they can do so

1234.0 --> 1236.24
far

1237.76 --> 1243.12
there's no ai bot that's completely

1240.48 --> 1244.159
mimicking a person

1243.12 --> 1246.2399999999998
and like

1244.159 --> 1249.2800000000002
develops and

1246.24 --> 1251.2
basically shows reflections upon what

1249.28 --> 1253.039
things that people go through that

1251.2 --> 1256.799
change them and change their attitude

1253.039 --> 1259.679
change their vibration etc bots can

1256.799 --> 1259.679
do that and

1260.799 --> 1266.8799999999999
if they try something like that then

1262.559 --> 1266.8799999999999
they are like stuck to a very specific

1268.159 --> 1270.0800000000002
setting

1269.2 --> 1271.76
it's

1270.08 --> 1275.039
they're not dynamic enough to be

1271.76 --> 1278.4
realistic it's like dude humans are very

1275.039 --> 1278.4
complicated creatures

1279.44 --> 1282.44
anyway

1316.08 --> 1320.32
paid agents no

1322.64 --> 1326.2
i doubt it

1333.919 --> 1340.96
like how like what would the money

1337.039 --> 1343.84
interest be to pay somebody to get on

1340.96 --> 1345.8400000000001
a very low profile show

1343.84 --> 1349.12
right well the only reason would be to

1345.84 --> 1352.0
kind of help it lift out of low profile

1349.12 --> 1356.08
so that would that's cause promotion

1352.0 --> 1358.64
right why else would paid people be paid

1356.08 --> 1361.84
to get in the way of low profile things

1358.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
that's just silly

1366.4 --> 1370.64
because guys i am low profile

1371.36 --> 1375.039
that doesn't mean that there aren't a

1373.44 --> 1378.159
lot of people

1375.039 --> 1378.1589999999999
aware about me

1378.799 --> 1382.96
but effectively i am low profile here on

1381.44 --> 1385.679
youtube

1382.96 --> 1388.679
zach got 2080

1385.679 --> 1388.679
subscribers

1392.159 --> 1397.6000000000001
and there's like 19 watching now

1394.64 --> 1402.039
to have somebody actually pay to like

1397.6 --> 1402.039
get in my way it's just

1402.08 --> 1408.24
that's not economically effective like

1404.88 --> 1411.44
that falls outside a lot like no it has

1408.24 --> 1413.679
to be people actually just wanting to do

1411.44 --> 1413.679
that

1415.2 --> 1420.559
right there's a lot of people that like

1417.6 --> 1422.8799999999999
they know how to grab all money for

1420.559 --> 1424.8799999999999
themselves together

1422.88 --> 1427.1200000000001
and then guess what

1424.88 --> 1428.8400000000001
the better they get at it the more time

1427.12 --> 1432.1589999999999
they have on their

1428.84 --> 1432.1589999999999
hands right

1433.919 --> 1439.44
and that time on their hands

1436.64 --> 1441.679
makes them get hobbies

1439.44 --> 1442.8400000000001
right now if they're any good their

1441.679 --> 1445.6000000000001
hobby will

1442.84 --> 1447.9189999999999
be like okay i'm gonna

1445.6 --> 1450.7199999999998
build something

1447.919 --> 1452.72
right i'm gonna craft something

1450.72 --> 1455.039
or maybe like

1452.72 --> 1458.52
take care of garden get a special plant

1455.039 --> 1458.52
you know hobbies

1458.64 --> 1463.039
but unfortunately a lot of people

1460.88 --> 1465.279
don't really do that or feel they don't

1463.039 --> 1467.36
have the opportunity or the worthiness

1465.279 --> 1470.799
or the skills to do it so then instead

1467.36 --> 1472.799
they just go kind of socializing

1470.799 --> 1476.48
and yeah internet

1472.799 --> 1478.8799999999999
is very easy for that very cheap

1476.48 --> 1481.1200000000001
so they end up just doing this sort of

1478.88 --> 1481.1200000000001
thing

1482.4 --> 1487.6000000000001
that's all voluntary that's people

1484.4 --> 1489.52
having time on their hands

1487.6 --> 1491.12
it's their hobby

1489.52 --> 1494.1589999999999
they're not really getting paid for it

1491.12 --> 1494.1589999999999
that makes no sense

1496.08 --> 1502.3999999999999
like who is paying them

1498.96 --> 1505.3600000000001
what do they think they will accomplish

1502.4 --> 1505.3600000000001
by doing that

1506.88 --> 1510.7990000000002
that it's worth investing money into

1509.679 --> 1512.72
right

1510.799 --> 1516.1589999999999
just think about it logically it doesn't

1512.72 --> 1519.52
make any sense to do that

1516.159 --> 1523.48
it's all just a bunch of pc level rumors

1519.52 --> 1523.48
don't don't buy it

1541.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
wow

1558.08 --> 1562.559
yeah hey glober mcglobe face we heard

1566.0 --> 1571.84
like are you gonna keep on bickering

1568.4 --> 1571.8400000000001
about it in my chat

1581.919 --> 1585.039
right

1582.799 --> 1587.52
so the yeah

1585.039 --> 1590.96
like even oh this is satirical why would

1587.52 --> 1593.36
google put that on top

1590.96 --> 1594.96
as a general search result why would

1593.36 --> 1598.0
they put

1594.96 --> 1602.32
what you claim is a fully satirical

1598.0 --> 1604.4
article why would they put that on top

1602.32 --> 1606.8799999999999
with that specific

1604.4 --> 1609.6000000000001
search order like why

1606.88 --> 1611.279
do they put that on top then

1609.6 --> 1615.0
right oh it's just satirical why did

1611.279 --> 1615.0
they put it on top

1626.159 --> 1628.72
why not

1631.279 --> 1637.279
well why wouldn't they

1633.2 --> 1638.72
address a more real article according to

1637.279 --> 1641.039
you

1638.72 --> 1642.96
where it is said just like with oh when

1641.039 --> 1646.0
you search is evolution a theory where

1642.96 --> 1647.279
it says no it's both a theory and a fact

1646.0 --> 1650.24
right

1647.279 --> 1652.32
why didn't they put something like that

1650.24 --> 1654.64
on top

1652.32 --> 1656.8799999999999
as a search result you have an

1654.64 --> 1659.3600000000001
explanation for that ballers

1656.88 --> 1662.64
huh are you just going to complain about

1659.36 --> 1665.6789999999999
the satirical article they put it on top

1662.64 --> 1668.0800000000002
instead why would they do that

1665.679 --> 1670.48
when you just search that is gravity a

1668.08 --> 1670.48
theory

1672.72 --> 1675.84
why don't you address that

1677.2 --> 1684.159
it's on top because it has the most hits

1680.159 --> 1685.44
[ __ ] cps that's absolute horseshit

1684.159 --> 1689.8400000000001
and you know it

1685.44 --> 1689.8400000000001
they haven't done that in over a decade

1690.0 --> 1694.96
you know google directs things

1692.799 --> 1697.84
not according to most hits

1694.96 --> 1697.8400000000001
that's [ __ ]

1714.24 --> 1717.919
oh oh they were just kidding yeah i know

1716.48 --> 1722.72
james mason

1717.919 --> 1725.8400000000001
but they were still just kidding on top

1722.72 --> 1725.84
as a search result

1732.08 --> 1738.24
it's all a giant appeal to google well

1735.12 --> 1739.12
you guys seem to be so adamant to point

1738.24 --> 1741.76
out

1739.12 --> 1745.36
it was only satirical yet it did appear

1741.76 --> 1745.36
on top in the search result

1751.36 --> 1757.039
i mean i'm just pointing out

1753.84 --> 1759.6789999999999
absolute facts that i demonstrated and

1757.039 --> 1761.919
showed you on screen

1759.679 --> 1763.8400000000001
right that's a fact that was the search

1761.919 --> 1765.679
result on top

1763.84 --> 1769.12
and you guys have been squirting about

1765.679 --> 1769.1200000000001
it for like half an hour now

1770.48 --> 1775.52
like could have just like oh okay

1773.279 --> 1777.039
and moved on to something else but no

1775.52 --> 1779.039
you had to

1777.039 --> 1782.32
dig into it

1779.039 --> 1786.48
and then reveal how it was only satire

1782.32 --> 1786.48
even though it was the top search result

1787.44 --> 1793.96
and then keep on bickering with the flat

1790.24 --> 1793.96
earthers in my chat

1806.799 --> 1811.52
look at all the people popping in i'll

1809.2 --> 1812.559
feel a need to say something about it

1811.52 --> 1815.279
too

1812.559 --> 1816.559
i really must be triggering them

1815.279 --> 1819.039
over such a

1816.559 --> 1821.279
trivial thing really from my vantage

1819.039 --> 1821.279
point

1821.44 --> 1825.76
like i don't use google

1826.32 --> 1831.76
to basically tell me what reality is

1829.279 --> 1833.76
i use it to find things

1831.76 --> 1836.72
and it it presents a lot of things that

1833.76 --> 1841.039
are blatantly wrong

1836.72 --> 1843.6000000000001
it's up for you to figure that out

1841.039 --> 1843.6
i have

1845.039 --> 1850.0
it wasn't satire it wasn't it wasn't

1846.96 --> 1852.24
true that's fine

1850.0 --> 1854.96
you know i don't mind either way whether

1852.24 --> 1855.919
it's just truth or was based on a satire

1854.96 --> 1858.72
article

1855.919 --> 1862.039
it was the top search result you see i

1858.72 --> 1862.039
don't care

1864.24 --> 1871.519
they care a lot a lot to basically

1867.36 --> 1871.519
repeat it like five times in my chat

1876.399 --> 1880.32
have you ever looked through a telescope

1878.48 --> 1882.3990000000001
oh

1880.32 --> 1885.9189999999999
man you have to look through a telescope

1882.399 --> 1885.9189999999999
or or you're not worthy

1886.48 --> 1890.799
well i have looked through telescopes

1888.72 --> 1894.559
especially when i was young i was very

1890.799 --> 1896.399
fascinated by the celestial bodies

1894.559 --> 1898.559
i also looked through a big telescope

1896.399 --> 1903.12
once and then realized that i was

1898.559 --> 1903.12
looking at a paper cut out of a planet

1903.36 --> 1907.84
and i was severely shocked

1921.44 --> 1925.519
i don't know where that happened

1926.399 --> 1933.6399999999999
i just have this distinct memory it

1928.64 --> 1933.64
could be dark world it was weird

1934.559 --> 1939.12
i think maybe it was like this dark

1936.559 --> 1942.96
world thing where they were trying to

1939.12 --> 1946.1589999999999
make it clear to me like no it is fake

1942.96 --> 1946.159
because it looked too fake

1946.48 --> 1949.48
like

1949.679 --> 1954.0800000000002
i just don't remember if that actually

1952.08 --> 1956.48
happened in the physical real world or

1954.08 --> 1958.0
if it was part of like this weird dark

1956.48 --> 1961.039
world

1958.0 --> 1961.039
revealing trip

1964.96 --> 1972.24
saturn is bloody bloody

1968.08 --> 1976.84
amazing true telescope is it

1972.24 --> 1976.84
it kind of always looks the same to me

1997.2 --> 2000.2
hmm

2013.76 --> 2019.679
yeah that's right lg

2016.72 --> 2023.84
yeah the art of making realistic looking

2019.679 --> 2023.8400000000001
planets is is not that hard

2027.519 --> 2031.44
like i used to draw that as a kid i

2029.76 --> 2034.559
still have those drawings by the way but

2031.44 --> 2034.559
they're in my storage

2038.0 --> 2042.2
afterwards stop though

2053.52 --> 2056.52
ah

2070.72 --> 2076.1589999999997
great cgi though oh you mean the uh the

2073.599 --> 2077.599
rendered version of saturn and jupiter

2076.159 --> 2081.48
yeah they're both very interesting

2077.599 --> 2081.48
looking i agree

2089.44 --> 2093.48
a nathan oakley 1980

2120.96 --> 2124.96
just lighting your skype oh i have a

2123.119 --> 2127.52
better telescope and then it's not a

2124.96 --> 2129.68
light in the sky anymore it has to be

2127.52 --> 2132.32
suddenly a solid thing you're looking at

2129.68 --> 2135.1189999999997
okay bad camera

2132.32 --> 2135.119
keep dreaming

2140.88 --> 2144.599
hello tara 306.

2169.76 --> 2174.48
how can some fake who says saturn is

2172.96 --> 2177.119
fake

2174.48 --> 2182.0
did i say it's fake i'm just saying it's

2177.119 --> 2182.0
not a physical object it's light

2182.4 --> 2187.56
and who knows the detail you can attain

2187.76 --> 2191.6800000000003
i don't know for sure i just know

2189.599 --> 2195.48
there's absolutely no proof whatsoever

2191.68 --> 2195.48
they're physical objects

2202.16 --> 2205.16
so

2215.76 --> 2219.119
oh okay lg

2219.44 --> 2222.56
through real stereo

2225.839 --> 2231.119
yeah i wouldn't listen to myself on

2228.079 --> 2231.119
headphones either

2234.8 --> 2240.8
i really don't like

2236.8 --> 2242.5600000000004
using headphones in general unless

2240.8 --> 2244.32
like i'm listening

2242.56 --> 2246.96
or i want to listen with great

2244.32 --> 2250.8
concentration to music

2246.96 --> 2250.8
then i might put on headphones

2250.88 --> 2255.4
but usually i prefer a speaker

2260.16 --> 2263.16
so

2292.72 --> 2295.72
ah

2297.9 --> 2300.949
[Music]

2304.48 --> 2308.909
so

2305.82 --> 2308.909
[Music]

2322.16 --> 2326.0
there he goes again

2324.0 --> 2328.56
dude i don't know what either of you are

2326.0 --> 2328.56
talking about

2332.079 --> 2337.28
it's just back and forth bickering to me

2335.119 --> 2339.599
i'm trying to find

2337.28 --> 2342.4
things to latch onto so that i can

2339.599 --> 2342.4
address it but

2352.88 --> 2358.7200000000003
yeah and hey timothy p it's all nice but

2356.64 --> 2360.96
your name sucks

2358.72 --> 2363.2799999999997
because it's way too long

2360.96 --> 2366.4
and it's literally just

2363.28 --> 2370.32
taking up huge space in my chat with

2366.4 --> 2370.32
your three-word sentences

2374.48 --> 2379.48
there you go another three-word sentence

2382.96 --> 2387.88
you're unwittingly spamming dude

2407.2 --> 2412.24
five word sentence and every time you

2409.839 --> 2416.64
say something

2412.24 --> 2416.64
your title takes up three sentences

2421.52 --> 2430.0
my point that is your point

2425.52 --> 2430.0
oh is it is that your point cps

2431.44 --> 2436.48
oh right you did say does anyone

2433.2 --> 2438.64
understand semi-tp

2436.48 --> 2441.2
now it's just

2438.64 --> 2443.44
kind of like semi-autistically blurting

2441.2 --> 2445.359
out things that's okay that's fine i get

2443.44 --> 2447.68
in that mood too sometimes in people's

2445.359 --> 2447.68
chats

2447.76 --> 2451.2400000000002
it's a butt

2456.48 --> 2462.0
is he a butt or really

2459.2 --> 2464.0789999999997
well he's a bot that also listens to my

2462.0 --> 2467.2
show then

2464.079 --> 2470.1600000000003
because he did just kind of

2467.2 --> 2472.56
respond to that obviously since nobody

2470.16 --> 2474.319
in chat specifically addressed

2472.56 --> 2477.7599999999998
him the way i did

2474.319 --> 2477.7599999999998
so where are you getting that from

2478.4 --> 2483.2000000000003
hey one father unit long time no see

2488.4 --> 2491.599
he makes no sense

2490.72 --> 2494.48
right

2491.599 --> 2496.0
well sometimes some people just start

2494.48 --> 2497.52
blabbering

2496.0 --> 2501.8
they're just like rambling about

2497.52 --> 2501.8
whatever pops in their mind

2509.2 --> 2516.0
our whim

2511.52 --> 2520.28
oh you did it and i win

2516.0 --> 2520.28
some trouble with the keyboard there

2540.4 --> 2544.28
true truth happened

2554.88 --> 2559.839
yeah okay i'm gonna time you out now

2556.72 --> 2562.9599999999996
you're starting to annoy me

2559.839 --> 2565.599
stop wasting my space in my chat

2562.96 --> 2569.119
you're literally blabbering nonsense

2565.599 --> 2571.76
stupid three-word sentences

2569.119 --> 2571.76
get a point

2575.119 --> 2578.119
right

2580.88 --> 2585.04
no james mason i did not see which it

2583.28 --> 2588.92
gets it

2585.04 --> 2588.92
at salt lake city

2618.0 --> 2622.24
it was

2618.839 --> 2622.24
amusing okay

2628.24 --> 2632.2
he got attacked by a girl

2636.56 --> 2641.7599999999998
really like attack detect or just like

2640.079 --> 2643.599
somebody trying to push him out of the

2641.76 --> 2646.6400000000003
way

2643.599 --> 2649.76
you got a link to that

2646.64 --> 2653.319
post it in chat

2649.76 --> 2653.3190000000004
i'll take a look

2676.96 --> 2679.28
whoa

2681.599 --> 2685.76
okay

2683.44 --> 2688.0
well i wouldn't call that attacked

2685.76 --> 2691.8390000000004
i wouldn't i would call that assaulted

2688.0 --> 2691.839
like what the hell serious

2692.64 --> 2695.7599999999998
kicked him in the face

2696.0 --> 2699.2
that's messed up dude

2701.2 --> 2706.72
which it was oh no not on video

2704.48 --> 2706.72
oh

2708.88 --> 2711.88
okay

2718.96 --> 2722.64
a surface day

2720.88 --> 2725.6400000000003
that sailor

2722.64 --> 2725.64
morning

2735.76 --> 2738.76
hmm

2747.28 --> 2750.28
uh

2770.0 --> 2773.68
ah yeah that's great i'll see i was

2772.24 --> 2777.7599999999998
gonna ask again

2773.68 --> 2779.44
like did the the pain situation recede

2777.76 --> 2781.599
what happened

2779.44 --> 2783.119
or are you still sitting through it and

2781.599 --> 2785.119
using it

2783.119 --> 2786.6400000000003
like i i kind of do want to know the

2785.119 --> 2789.839
details

2786.64 --> 2789.839
because this is my

2790.0 --> 2796.48
this is my experiment i'm like i used it

2793.599 --> 2798.1600000000003
on myself and now i just i need to see

2796.48 --> 2800.0
like what it does with other people

2798.16 --> 2801.44
because i have no other references to

2800.0 --> 2805.119
this

2801.44 --> 2807.119
this is to me like a discovery

2805.119 --> 2810.48
but yeah i don't exactly have like a

2807.119 --> 2812.0
laboratory available and then oh let's

2810.48 --> 2815.28
petition

2812.0 --> 2818.0
a hundred people to test this

2815.28 --> 2821.119
so i'm just very

2818.0 --> 2824.16
eager to get more info

2821.119 --> 2827.6800000000003
on how and yeah what it does

2824.16 --> 2830.839
how is it how is it affecting

2827.68 --> 2830.839
the situation

2836.96 --> 2843.559
but i'm really glad that it turned out

2839.28 --> 2843.559
to have helped that's great

2849.04 --> 2852.8
yeah that those are the moment that just

2850.88 --> 2854.7200000000003
gives me the feeling like okay becoming

2852.8 --> 2856.8
a layman

2854.72 --> 2858.3999999999996
kind of doctor

2856.8 --> 2861.52
whatever yeah

2858.4 --> 2861.52
it's worth it at least

2865.92 --> 2869.28
you don't necessarily have to have a

2867.839 --> 2873.24
paper

2869.28 --> 2873.2400000000002
in order to heal people

2878.16 --> 2881.16
anyway

2892.72 --> 2896.48
that's science cause and effect

2895.04 --> 2898.64
relationship

2896.48 --> 2901.52
well it's more like

2898.64 --> 2904.0
medical science right for medical

2901.52 --> 2906.24
science you just got to test it

2904.0 --> 2908.4
and if you want to get it really proven

2906.24 --> 2910.8799999999997
then you got to have like a

2908.4 --> 2912.319
a control group and all that

2910.88 --> 2915.04
so

2912.319 --> 2918.4
yeah

2915.04 --> 2920.5589999999997
actual medical science is

2918.4 --> 2922.88
kind of tends to be expensive because

2920.559 --> 2925.92
there's just so much you will need to do

2922.88 --> 2927.359
so many people you need to get involved

2925.92 --> 2929.359
and they'll have to meet the right

2927.359 --> 2932.64
condition

2929.359 --> 2932.64
and do it voluntary

2936.4 --> 2941.319
i ended up getting into what okay

2944.8 --> 2949.88
all right

2946.88 --> 2949.88
okay

2957.119 --> 2963.92
you you could have if yeah if you could

2960.4 --> 2965.599
have also for example tested oregano oil

2963.92 --> 2968.079
if you really wanted to have like the

2965.599 --> 2969.839
effect of antibiotics oregano oil gets

2968.079 --> 2972.079
pretty close to that as as well it's

2969.839 --> 2972.0789999999997
very

2972.16 --> 2974.8799999999997
you can ask

2975.119 --> 2979.839
brian

2977.52 --> 2981.839
about that he like he really favors

2979.839 --> 2984.839
oregano oil so he does know a lot about

2981.839 --> 2984.839
it

2990.319 --> 2996.119
but anyway hey as long as it worked

2992.559 --> 2996.119
that's just great

2999.359 --> 3003.7599999999998
right and it is in the cure all that's

3001.44 --> 3006.319
right yeah the magnesium it's not a cure

3003.76 --> 3006.3190000000004
it's like

3006.64 --> 3012.48
it's a symptom

3008.319 --> 3015.2799999999997
suppressor for some reason

3012.48 --> 3018.8
so yeah less anguish

3015.28 --> 3018.8
i'm really glad it worked

3020.72 --> 3023.9199999999996
hello one photo unit

3024.079 --> 3028.48
got coffee

3027.04 --> 3030.88
eric

3028.48 --> 3032.72
one one one one

3030.88 --> 3036.599
good to see you wow

3032.72 --> 3036.5989999999997
plenty of people in chat

3052.16 --> 3055.16
um

3056.48 --> 3059.599
well maybe

3065.92 --> 3070.4
but yeah you're not gonna chew gum if

3068.16 --> 3072.319
you have like a throbbing toothache if

3070.4 --> 3073.2000000000003
you know what i mean

3072.319 --> 3075.359
so

3073.2 --> 3080.359
that's kind of past that stage it's more

3075.359 --> 3080.359
like a preventative i guess

3082.4 --> 3087.599
little magnesium silica

3085.359 --> 3090.0789999999997
perhaps i don't know you know

3087.599 --> 3092.319
the funny thing was just that just the

3090.079 --> 3094.88
magnesium

3092.319 --> 3097.119
has that distinct effect now yeah of

3094.88 --> 3099.28
course you could try to mix it in with

3097.119 --> 3102.559
other things

3099.28 --> 3102.559
to like address the

3103.28 --> 3108.48
the inflammation directly

3105.359 --> 3110.64
get more yeah antibiotic alike like

3108.48 --> 3113.76
oregano oil but yeah it's a very

3110.64 --> 3116.48
distinct taste or

3113.76 --> 3118.8
you could try colloidal silver

3116.48 --> 3118.8
or

3119.44 --> 3124.2000000000003
what else

3121.2 --> 3124.2
garlic

3124.319 --> 3127.839
right

3126.079 --> 3129.8390000000004
strong garlic

3127.839 --> 3131.92
there's all kinds of things that you can

3129.839 --> 3134.48
try instead of antibiotics because

3131.92 --> 3137.04
antibiotics does always have a pretty

3134.48 --> 3138.8
big impact on your system especially

3137.04 --> 3141.2799999999997
your intestines

3138.8 --> 3143.6800000000003
often you have to reboot your intestine

3141.28 --> 3145.8390000000004
flora after you've done it

3143.68 --> 3149.24
because it yeah it tends to kill off a

3145.839 --> 3149.24
lot of the flora

3154.8 --> 3158.2400000000002
cloves

3156.64 --> 3163.96
um

3158.24 --> 3163.9599999999996
could could do one father unit clove oil

3166.8 --> 3170.96
but like clove oil is like it's

3169.839 --> 3172.88
it's

3170.96 --> 3176.16
it's different from magnesium because

3172.88 --> 3178.8
it's literally like a numbing agent

3176.16 --> 3180.7999999999997
it it top it locally numbs like the

3178.8 --> 3181.92
nerve effect that's why you yeah if you

3180.8 --> 3184.6400000000003
have it over your tongue you can

3181.92 --> 3186.7200000000003
literally just hey what happened i can't

3184.64 --> 3187.52
feel my tongue move normally anymore

3186.72 --> 3189.2
right

3187.52 --> 3191.44
it's different

3189.2 --> 3194.3999999999996
magnesium does not do that at all but it

3191.44 --> 3197.839
does take like shave off clearly the

3194.4 --> 3200.88
edge the peak of the pain so that it has

3197.839 --> 3200.88
less of an impact

3202.16 --> 3207.44
hot whiskey loads of sugar and what

3205.119 --> 3207.44
what

3207.52 --> 3209.839
why

3214.0 --> 3216.16
no

3218.64 --> 3223.839
no especially the sugar that's just a

3220.72 --> 3223.839
bad idea

3225.599 --> 3232.3590000000004
like sugar is not a go-to when you have

3228.0 --> 3232.359
any sort of inflammation situation

3238.96 --> 3242.96
hmm hey what's that james mason

3249.839 --> 3256.48
how did you do it uh no no no no

3254.079 --> 3256.48
just a

3256.559 --> 3261.52
pot

3258.24 --> 3265.2799999999997
of magnesium citrate it could be like

3261.52 --> 3266.96
five bucks or whatever it's just powder

3265.28 --> 3269.52
like with a scoop

3266.96 --> 3269.52
right see

3276.319 --> 3280.4
and you just put it

3278.48 --> 3282.799
in a cup

3280.4 --> 3286.48
pour a bit of water with it

3282.799 --> 3290.319
mix it around until it it dissolves

3286.48 --> 3290.319
and then you can just rinse that around

3290.799 --> 3295.04
don't really need anything else for that

3292.88 --> 3297.28
it's very you could do it very quickly

3295.04 --> 3300.5589999999997
and it's super cheap so this like a pot

3297.28 --> 3302.799
like that can last well

3300.559 --> 3306.8390000000004
i've been using it pretty regularly now

3302.799 --> 3306.839
for half a year and it's

3306.96 --> 3315.679
it's still like three quarters full

3310.57 --> 3315.679
[Music]

3351.76 --> 3357.28
all right that's a

3353.44 --> 3357.28
video with wits it salt lake

3357.92 --> 3361.96
so it was actually recorded

3362.48 --> 3365.48
okay

3379.44 --> 3383.2000000000003
right

3380.88 --> 3384.96
trying to find something

no it doesn't matter that it's very

3556.559 --> 3560.88
cheap

3558.64 --> 3563.44
i can't

3560.88 --> 3566.6400000000003
i can't afford to

3563.44 --> 3569.52
to push on it because

3566.64 --> 3569.52
i don't have it

3570.839 --> 3574.48

3585.359 --> 3590.0
lot

3587.839 --> 3591.7599999999998
and i do appreciate you

3590.0 --> 3593.839
i think it's probably mutual or you

3591.76 --> 3594.88
wouldn't be hanging around in my chat so

3593.839 --> 3596.319
much

3594.88 --> 3599.28
but

3596.319 --> 3601.119
i also do take money from ballers

3599.28 --> 3603.92
as long as they're not

3601.119 --> 3606.48
creepy demons they're just trying to buy

3603.92 --> 3609.52
me out or something right donations have

3606.48 --> 3609.52
to be unconditional

3612.839 --> 3616.48
oh what

3616.799 --> 3620.079
your tiny womble

3620.4 --> 3623.119
oh okay

3623.52 --> 3626.52

hmm

3636.799 --> 3642.16
yeah that could match actually yeah okay

3639.04 --> 3645.2
i see it

3642.16 --> 3647.52
you said that many times before

3645.2 --> 3651.2
dude i don't even know if tiny womble is

3647.52 --> 3651.2
banned i don't think he is

3653.04 --> 3656.52
maybe i did

3660.4 --> 3664.48
i think it was because you were getting

3662.0 --> 3667.48
just creepy with the facts [ __ ] and all

3664.48 --> 3667.48
that

3674.72 --> 3678.799
huh

3676.559 --> 3682.3590000000004
but no this is the first time i'm

3678.799 --> 3682.359
learning about it

3687.48 --> 3695.76
[Music]

3693.839 --> 3699.839
no

3695.76 --> 3699.8390000000004
i don't think you're in there dude

3701.2 --> 3703.9199999999996
i'm serious

3704.96 --> 3709.359
i don't

3706.96 --> 3710.319
look dude i have banned

3709.359 --> 3712.4
people

3710.319 --> 3715.359
and then what i typically do is it's

3712.4 --> 3717.52
like a prolonged timeout i unban them

3715.359 --> 3720.88
the next day

3717.52 --> 3720.88
or later in the evening

3723.52 --> 3727.7599999999998
but you're not in my banned list i'm

3726.079 --> 3730.92
looking through it right now you're not

3727.76 --> 3730.92
in there

3743.28 --> 3746.28
so

3760.559 --> 3764.6400000000003
doctor guns are still banned oh yes

3763.039 --> 3768.5200000000004

3764.64 --> 3768.52
now you can [ __ ] off

3771.59 --> 3774.6890000000003
[Music]

3778.08 --> 3782.5589999999997
[Music]

3780.0 --> 3784.319
hey george sanford good memory just

3782.559 --> 3787.3190000000004
short are you talking about yourself or

3784.319 --> 3787.319
me

3801.839 --> 3806.16
we're all magicians with money what

3807.44 --> 3811.799
well i'm not

3808.799 --> 3811.799
unfortunately

3821.2 --> 3824.799
no i didn't think he was funny at all

3823.2 --> 3827.799
bad karma i just thought it was very

3824.799 --> 3827.799
annoying

3845.119 --> 3848.6400000000003
we make it disappear oh

3850.48 --> 3856.28
i understand you know there's so much

3852.559 --> 3856.28
you can do with money

3883.839 --> 3888.16
all your donations go to your girlfriend

3886.48 --> 3890.2400000000002
okay

3888.16 --> 3893.96
that's a matter of priorities by the way

3890.24 --> 3893.9599999999996
that sounds like

3899.359 --> 3903.64
ah never mind i'm not gonna

3908.0 --> 3912.079
just reminds me of a certain type of

3910.079 --> 3915.7200000000003
arrangement

3912.079 --> 3915.7200000000003
rather than a girlfriend

3971.76 --> 3980.559
it's a complicated i take it you meant

3974.96 --> 3983.28
to say affair to live with woman with it

3980.559 --> 3983.28
yes it is

3985.599 --> 3990.079
unless

3987.359 --> 3990.0789999999997
you're a man

3991.28 --> 3998.3190000000004
and you know how to do that and you

3994.0 --> 4001.319
avoid women that just kind of do that

3998.319 --> 4001.319
right

4011.599 --> 4015.3590000000004
like i i could never

4013.44 --> 4017.2000000000003
live like that well i can literally

4015.359 --> 4020.96
never live like that because i don't

4017.2 --> 4022.0789999999997
really make money a lot like that

4020.96 --> 4023.839
but i have

4022.079 --> 4027.039
services

4023.839 --> 4031.0789999999997
i have skills to provide

4027.039 --> 4031.079
in a lot of different departments

4040.16 --> 4043.0389999999998
so i guess that

4043.2 --> 4048.72
i'd rather be like the boyfriend that

4046.079 --> 4050.6400000000003
they would throw money at

4048.72 --> 4053.1189999999997
but that doesn't usually work out all

4050.64 --> 4053.1189999999997
that great

4060.88 --> 4065.92
right besides they can't really buy me

4064.24 --> 4069.0389999999998
like that

4065.92 --> 4071.6800000000003
so yeah i don't know

4069.039 --> 4073.76
to be fair i've only lived with a woman

4071.68 --> 4077.68
once

4073.76 --> 4082.0
which my memory was still amazing

4077.68 --> 4082.0
it's very exhilarating and inspiring and

4085.359 --> 4091.64
but it wasn't gonna be

4088.079 --> 4091.6400000000003
something great

4095.359 --> 4101.64
in the end so and i kind of knew that

4098.64 --> 4101.64
anyway

4110.64 --> 4116.64
girls with daddy issues

4113.04 --> 4116.64
always gravitated toward me

4116.799 --> 4119.839
all right

4120.239 --> 4126.159
so you have like a rebellious boyfriend

4122.64 --> 4126.159000000001
thing going on i guess

4127.52 --> 4131.2390000000005
oh jason mccormack

4141.759 --> 4144.0
huh

4145.44 --> 4148.879999999999
10 euros for veggies

4147.44 --> 4152.239
all right service day i really

4148.88 --> 4152.2390000000005
appreciate that thanks man

4154.159 --> 4159.239
i'll see it when it arrives in the mail

4179.92 --> 4186.799
right but anyway yeah for me dude guys

4183.44 --> 4189.04
it's for me uh i've been out of the

4186.799 --> 4191.92
circuit of like

4189.04 --> 4194.239
even attempting to get a girlfriend

4191.92 --> 4196.2390000000005
that i don't even know like how i work

4194.239 --> 4200.599999999999
anymore like that i know i have skills i

4196.239 --> 4200.599999999999
know what i've done in the past but

4202.4 --> 4207.12
like if i ever engage in a relationship

4205.199 --> 4210.879999999999
again it's gonna have serious startup

4207.12 --> 4210.88
issues because i'm like so

4211.199 --> 4215.5199999999995
disconnected from that

4213.28 --> 4219.12
from that as a priority now even though

4215.52 --> 4221.76
i like most of my life guys

4219.12 --> 4224.4
i was like obsessed getting a girlfriend

4221.76 --> 4226.030000000001
like really at a very young age i like

4224.4 --> 4228.239
really wanted it from

4226.03 --> 4230.719
[Music]

4228.239 --> 4233.5199999999995
very young age on like six and i have

4230.719 --> 4235.44
like even there's cute photographs of me

4233.52 --> 4236.56
as a little boy

4235.44 --> 4238.96
being

4236.56 --> 4241.84
totally in love with a girl

4238.96 --> 4241.84
of my age

4242.08 --> 4246.159
so i was like especially when i was

4243.92 --> 4248.8
super young i was always like in love

4246.159 --> 4250.48
with girls and they were like blissfully

4248.8 --> 4253.6
ignorant of that

4250.48 --> 4253.599999999999
but they still liked me

4254.0 --> 4258.48
but then later like when sexuality

4256.64 --> 4260.8
really came in then it suddenly became

4258.48 --> 4262.959999999999
very complicated and only had my real

4260.8 --> 4265.679
first girlfriend

4262.96 --> 4269.44
when i was 18.

4265.679 --> 4271.52
just makes it perfectly illegal

4269.44 --> 4275.678999999999
whatever

4271.52 --> 4275.679
but i kind of let that go

4275.92 --> 4279.92
i let it go after my ex

4278.48 --> 4281.599999999999
because i just

4279.92 --> 4285.719
it dominated

4281.6 --> 4285.719
my spirit so much

4287.6 --> 4292.8
and i have some i have a like well a

4290.719 --> 4294.8
better purpose for my spirit now and i

4292.8 --> 4297.12
have to keep it stable

4294.8 --> 4298.719
i can't allow my spirit to get

4297.12 --> 4301.84
distracted

4298.719 --> 4301.84
by that

4301.92 --> 4308.96
heavy interaction and like the weird

4305.36 --> 4311.759999999999
social play that does happen between

4308.96 --> 4311.76
man and a woman

4312.56 --> 4317.52
it's like i can't handle that right now

4316.159 --> 4319.679
and that's why it

4317.52 --> 4323.1990000000005
hasn't really done anything in 10 years

4319.679 --> 4325.04
even though like yeah i think girls are

4323.199 --> 4326.639999999999
or some women

4325.04 --> 4328.8
very cute

4326.64 --> 4331.679
and i do kind of get a little flirty i

4328.8 --> 4333.12
just i don't make a move i don't do it

4331.679 --> 4335.6
anymore

4333.12 --> 4340.84
i just i'm like no no no they'll just be

4335.6 --> 4340.84
happy not no not really knowing me

4352.8 --> 4355.8
yep

4356.64 --> 4358.96
right

4361.84 --> 4366.4800000000005
and then there was there is also kind of

4364.08 --> 4368.239
the traumatizing effect

4366.48 --> 4371.599999999999
with my ex

4368.239 --> 4373.839999999999
let's get yeah that

4371.6 --> 4373.84
like

4376.08 --> 4381.679
just dealing with flat earth

4378.88 --> 4383.28
and love is difficult because yeah you

4381.679 --> 4386.159
never really know what's going to happen

4383.28 --> 4386.159
once you break it

4389.84 --> 4394.56
and it's even a possibility that a girl

4392.719 --> 4396.0
thinks you're really cute they kind of

4394.56 --> 4397.76
fall in love

4396.0 --> 4399.84
and they're like oh yeah yeah sure flat

4397.76 --> 4402.96
earth that's no problem right

4399.84 --> 4404.0
but then after a while suddenly

4402.96 --> 4406.64
they're not

4404.0 --> 4410.4
like the in love phase is kind of

4406.64 --> 4412.0
dimming down it always happens

4410.4 --> 4414.48
and then it might turn out that they're

4412.0 --> 4417.12
not actually interested after all and

4414.48 --> 4418.5599999999995
then i've already gone undergone the

4417.12 --> 4419.36
bonding

4418.56 --> 4422.320000000001
right

4419.36 --> 4422.32
then you're [ __ ]

4425.52 --> 4427.84
so

4431.199 --> 4434.799999999999
she married someone else that [ __ ]

4436.88 --> 4440.28
i don't know

4442.96 --> 4449.199
in a way i kind of want to try to play

4445.76 --> 4451.84
it more casual and not like if

4449.199 --> 4454.32
like it's a religion

4451.84 --> 4456.8
like really heavy in love and everything

4454.32 --> 4458.48
is so bloody serious

4456.8 --> 4461.4800000000005
because that's kind of how i've done it

4458.48 --> 4461.48
always

4469.52 --> 4476.400000000001
but it hasn't exactly made it easier for

4473.36 --> 4478.5599999999995
me to really understand

4476.4 --> 4481.28
how having a relationship works

4478.56 --> 4484.8
basically because of my own fanaticism

4481.28 --> 4488.44
the fanaticism distracted me also

4484.8 --> 4488.4400000000005
from my insecurity

4501.04 --> 4505.28
first love was shira that's hilarious

4506.96 --> 4512.88
my first love was a real live woman i'm

4510.159 --> 4512.879999999999
happy to say

4522.32 --> 4526.5599999999995
but yeah after i got like in saturday

4524.4 --> 4528.239
morning cartoons and all that for me it

4526.56 --> 4531.120000000001
was actually

4528.239 --> 4532.879999999999
in retrospect super silly but i was so

4531.12 --> 4534.88
young

4532.88 --> 4538.36
but i did also fall in love with like a

4534.88 --> 4538.36
cartoon character

4539.04 --> 4544.08
it was so so silly now in retrospect but

4542.32 --> 4546.719
yeah it's kind of like you fall into a

4544.08 --> 4546.719
trance and

4547.52 --> 4552.96
yes bad karma a real life woman

4550.64 --> 4554.8
a girl

4552.96 --> 4556.4800000000005
i fell in love with women all the time

4554.8 --> 4558.159000000001
when i was really young

4556.48 --> 4560.879999999999
and i fell in love with one of my

4558.159 --> 4560.879999999999
teachers too

4565.52 --> 4569.1990000000005
not just one by the way i think i've had

4567.52 --> 4572.0
like three teachers

4569.199 --> 4574.5599999999995
but one i was like really into her and

4572.0 --> 4576.159
then afterward like she started to

4574.56 --> 4578.56
notice like okay you're getting a little

4576.159 --> 4580.96
obsessive here

4578.56 --> 4584.159000000001
please back it off and then i was like

4580.96 --> 4584.159
all heartbroken about it

4584.88 --> 4590.76
that's like when i was

4587.12 --> 4590.76
six or something

4607.12 --> 4610.64
daphne and scooby-doo

4611.36 --> 4613.92
all right

4618.159 --> 4622.48
i can't blame you it i don't know it's

4620.239 --> 4625.36
not enough for me to fall off with

4622.48 --> 4625.36
but yeah

4626.159 --> 4632.199
she is drawn pretty quick

4628.88 --> 4632.1990000000005
cute looking

4660.239 --> 4666.08
right but yeah as i grew up got more

4663.44 --> 4668.639999999999
sexual also i kind of started to lose

4666.08 --> 4668.64
interest

4668.96 --> 4673.52
in well cartoon figurines he didn't do

4671.679 --> 4678.0
it for me anyway because it wasn't just

4673.52 --> 4680.2390000000005
me dreaming it was also like a sexuality

4678.0 --> 4680.239
so

4680.56 --> 4684.64
but yeah i'm not gonna burden you with

4682.8 --> 4687.28
the details of what that was like i

4684.64 --> 4692.04
think that a lot of guys kind of

4687.28 --> 4692.04
like embarrassing memories about that

4694.4 --> 4698.08
but i did kind of avoid

4701.12 --> 4704.5599999999995
getting carried away with that

4704.88 --> 4709.1990000000005
like not get sexually obsessed and all

4707.04 --> 4709.199
that

4710.64 --> 4714.64
and yeah a lot of the times

4712.4 --> 4717.04
unsuccessfully by the way

4714.64 --> 4720.159000000001
but yeah never got into anything pervy

4717.04 --> 4722.239
it was always anchored in love and then

4720.159 --> 4724.96
eventually when i yeah i got into

4722.239 --> 4726.959999999999
puberty it became love with sex

4724.96 --> 4730.0
but it never really stepped away from

4726.96 --> 4730.0
love thank god

4733.04 --> 4737.12
i'm black bulman drank mossy

4738.159 --> 4741.28
so did vegeta

4742.32 --> 4745.799999999999
i get it

4750.4 --> 4755.48
jennifer lawrence is my second one

4763.28 --> 4766.32
she looked like again

4774.48 --> 4777.839999999999
keyboard damn it

4784.96 --> 4789.56
oh

4786.56 --> 4789.56
right

4800.4 --> 4803.44
i do get it but

4803.6 --> 4808.400000000001
no

4805.76 --> 4808.400000000001
no for me

4810.96 --> 4815.96
oh maybe

4812.56 --> 4815.96
i don't know

4820.96 --> 4824.4800000000005
i think that

4822.639 --> 4826.88
what something i've noticed is that like

4824.48 --> 4830.04
she's becoming a little bit overly aware

4826.88 --> 4830.04
of herself

4837.679 --> 4840.92
now what

4853.679 --> 4857.159
what the hell

4869.52 --> 4873.280000000001
is that some kind of gamma off or

4871.76 --> 4875.84
something

4873.28 --> 4875.84
sheesh

4880.08 --> 4885.84
maybe my future girlfriend why what the

4883.44 --> 4885.839999999999
dude

4886.0 --> 4890.32
that karma that is messed up i don't

4888.08 --> 4893.5199999999995
think i'm i'm gonna like

4890.32 --> 4896.239
at least i don't have any ambitions

4893.52 --> 4900.4400000000005
to marry like a 20 years old

4896.239 --> 4900.44
when i'm 60 thanks

4902.56 --> 4908.96
i am not going to vow to exclude it

4906.48 --> 4910.48
because screw you i want to have a kid

4908.96 --> 4912.719
at some point

4910.48 --> 4912.718999999999
but

4913.12 --> 4920.12
that's not been among my long-term

4915.84 --> 4920.12
strategy if you know what i mean

4935.28 --> 4939.92
that's what they all say

4937.44 --> 4939.919999999999
okay

4943.679 --> 4946.0
hey

4953.44 --> 4956.879999999999
dude if i were 60 and i'd still kind of

4956.08 --> 4959.12
look

4956.88 --> 4960.96
as young as i do now then maybe it will

4959.12 --> 4963.599999999999
be completely different and it will be

4960.96 --> 4965.84
just like what is this weird guy he's 60

4963.6 --> 4968.8
why does he look like he's 30

4965.84 --> 4968.8
that's just weird

4969.04 --> 4972.88
and then maybe

4970.32 --> 4975.5199999999995
yeah people kind of like

4972.88 --> 4976.639
whatever man this is

4975.52 --> 4979.040000000001
what

4976.639 --> 4980.400000000001
no i'm not going there

4979.04 --> 4983.6
i'm still

4980.4 --> 4985.5199999999995
early in my 40s and i'm not really

4983.6 --> 4990.159000000001
concerned with

4985.52 --> 4995.0
my dating life or whatever in my 60s

4990.159 --> 4995.0
it's not not yet at least

5008.48 --> 5011.48
so

5018.239 --> 5021.759999999999
40s is the new 20s

5024.719 --> 5029.84
i i i wouldn't want to be in my 20s

5027.6 --> 5029.84
anymore

5031.28 --> 5034.159
it's too much

5034.719 --> 5038.08
energy too little grip

5039.199 --> 5043.839999999999
or at least that that's what it was for

5041.36 --> 5043.839999999999
me

5044.08 --> 5049.84
now this is in a way i'm 40 now and it

5047.6 --> 5053.280000000001
is to me

5049.84 --> 5057.12
almost like this is my 20s i'm weird

5053.28 --> 5061.44
like that i'm a late bloomer i'm a i'm a

5057.12 --> 5061.44
half elf and for some reason

5061.52 --> 5065.76
like everything just

5063.199 --> 5070.44
goes slower

5065.76 --> 5070.4400000000005
like all the processes even like

5070.8 --> 5073.679
like the physical

5077.199 --> 5083.96
like my puberty

5080.08 --> 5083.96
lasted very long

5100.96 --> 5103.96
anyway

5116.4 --> 5120.4
ah cps yeah good on you man

5120.719 --> 5126.76
25 years damn that's a that's a long

5123.76 --> 5126.76
time

5133.44 --> 5136.44
huh

5149.92 --> 5153.52
this is

5150.96 --> 5155.44
oh that's just rough bad karma that's

5153.52 --> 5158.84
just rough i don't think he's married to

5155.44 --> 5158.839999999999
helen keller

5184.8 --> 5188.56
oh you don't what hmm

5189.36 --> 5196.48
keller makes the perfect wife

5192.4 --> 5200.0
you see she's so good at acting

5196.48 --> 5200.0
now i'm not gonna go there

5200.56 --> 5206.8
um benjamin did some great

5204.08 --> 5210.5199999999995
skits on helen keller if you haven't

5206.8 --> 5210.52
seen that it's hilarious

5226.159 --> 5231.36
you have advanced arrested development

5229.04 --> 5231.36
what

5234.32 --> 5241.639
you just made that up didn't

5236.84 --> 5241.639
you that really a thing

5256.239 --> 5261.28
we're gonna make up things

5258.48 --> 5264.28
well then i consider myself chronically

5261.28 --> 5264.28
challenged

5266.0 --> 5271.239
slightly discontarted from normal time

5290.32 --> 5297.799999999999
yeah you did make it up i knew it

5294.8 --> 5297.8
huh

5316.96 --> 5319.96
hmm

5328.8 --> 5333.28
no jason mccormack's that's not

5332.0 --> 5335.44
gross

5333.28 --> 5339.12
not chronically

5335.44 --> 5339.12
ah it's how do you call that

5340.4 --> 5344.239
because chronos

5342.159 --> 5348.239
time

5344.239 --> 5349.678999999999
but yeah chronic also kind of means like

5348.239 --> 5354.239
permanently

5349.679 --> 5354.2390000000005
so this yeah that's not how i meant it

5354.719 --> 5359.44
and your chronic challenge is more like

5357.76 --> 5362.679
yeah that's called being a drug addict

5359.44 --> 5362.678999999999
that's different

5375.12 --> 5380.36
timo osman was in the wizzit video one

5397.04 --> 5402.4
yes bad karma yes

5399.6 --> 5402.400000000001
yes it does

5403.6 --> 5410.360000000001
that is if you're still attracted yes it

5407.36 --> 5410.36
does

5422.8 --> 5425.679
hey good seven

5430.239 --> 5435.839999999999
well she was dude i don't care

5432.88 --> 5437.92
if you're still interested yeah then you

5435.84 --> 5440.159000000001
are gay bad karma

5437.92 --> 5442.32
if you're still interested after that

5440.159 --> 5446.4
transition

5442.32 --> 5449.84
any transition yeah you are gay yes

5446.4 --> 5449.839999999999
is that clear enough an answer

5476.88 --> 5479.6
oh [ __ ]

5480.48 --> 5484.199
service day yeah

5492.48 --> 5496.718999999999
so was she all like shocked and

5494.48 --> 5498.879999999999
discontorted over that

5496.719 --> 5502.32
can imagine like oh i'm here for mental

5498.88 --> 5502.32
support i'm like no i'm all right

5502.639 --> 5507.52
uh

5504.96 --> 5509.679
uh what is your physical condition

5507.52 --> 5512.96
have you done something bad

5509.679 --> 5516.4
to yourself did you take any v's

5512.96 --> 5517.6
yeah then like if they never really know

5516.4 --> 5520.239
known that

5517.6 --> 5521.84
it's going to be one hell of a shock

5520.239 --> 5523.44
or they are going to say like i'm not

5521.84 --> 5525.52
listening to you i'm not listening to

5523.44 --> 5527.599999999999
you you're crazy

5525.52 --> 5531.4800000000005
it can't be that

5527.6 --> 5531.4800000000005
they'll still be shocked

5537.44 --> 5540.879999999999
she got scared

5538.96 --> 5542.639
oh you got a little over enthusiastic

5540.88 --> 5544.639
yeah you got to be very careful with

5542.639 --> 5548.0
that dude like your enemy you can be

5544.639 --> 5551.84
like way too aggressive with your energy

5548.0 --> 5554.239
and i have that tendency too sometimes

5551.84 --> 5555.4400000000005
made a lot of effort to get that under

5554.239 --> 5557.5199999999995
control

5555.44 --> 5561.839999999999
because you can just accidentally

5557.52 --> 5561.84
spiritually assault people like that

5561.92 --> 5567.1990000000005
especially if you're bringing extreme

5564.48 --> 5569.5199999999995
news yeah bringing extreme news with

5567.199 --> 5572.5599999999995
extreme energy is

5569.52 --> 5575.92
kind of literally an assault

5572.56 --> 5577.76
when you do that you have to know that

5575.92 --> 5579.12
it's literally like you're attacking

5577.76 --> 5582.2390000000005
people

5579.12 --> 5585.28
when you bring very extreme news in with

5582.239 --> 5589.239
extreme energy

5585.28 --> 5589.239
you gotta be very careful

5590.639 --> 5594.639
oh you've already known her for a while

5595.12 --> 5599.04
okay well then she did probably get a

5597.12 --> 5601.44
little bit more opportunity to get used

5599.04 --> 5601.44
to you

5601.76 --> 5608.159000000001
doing that

5603.76 --> 5608.159000000001
in that case i'm waging war yeah well

5609.28 --> 5614.0
just know what the what the consequences

5611.679 --> 5616.4
are right if you're just constantly

5614.0 --> 5618.96
waging war eventually there will be

5616.4 --> 5618.96
victims

5623.679 --> 5627.04
she asked me how i was doing she got the

5626.0 --> 5629.36
truth

5627.04 --> 5630.8
i understand that i understand that

5629.36 --> 5632.799999999999
right of course you're going to be

5630.8 --> 5635.84
yourself especially if you've already

5632.8 --> 5636.96
done that consistently but then when you

5635.84 --> 5639.360000000001
change

5636.96 --> 5642.96
the focal point of the subject you're

5639.36 --> 5646.0
talking about and make it about her

5642.96 --> 5647.84
then you have to put that back in the

5646.0 --> 5649.679
can again

5647.84 --> 5651.4400000000005
you have to tone it down because now

5649.679 --> 5653.28
you're talking about somebody else's

5651.44 --> 5655.839999999999
life

5653.28 --> 5658.239
it might get close to her

5655.84 --> 5660.400000000001
and if you then break something like

5658.239 --> 5663.04
really terrible and terrifying to her

5660.4 --> 5665.36
you're going to be very

5663.04 --> 5666.96
calm

5665.36 --> 5668.96
because otherwise you're you're just

5666.96 --> 5671.52
going to like

5668.96 --> 5673.92
psionically whip her

5671.52 --> 5676.8
right you gotta be very careful

5673.92 --> 5679.8
it's all this information is super high

5676.8 --> 5679.8
impact

5686.4 --> 5690.32
you were so high energy yesterday like

5688.8 --> 5692.4800000000005
that and you got to be careful man

5690.32 --> 5695.679
because you just have a tendency to like

5692.48 --> 5699.36
explode in doom chance and [ __ ] it's not

5695.679 --> 5702.56
good for anybody especially not you

5699.36 --> 5704.96
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

5702.56 --> 5708.400000000001
it's been interesting very lots of

5704.96 --> 5708.4
personal conversation here

5709.04 --> 5713.76
i do appreciate

5712.08 --> 5716.4
like sharing and

5713.76 --> 5716.400000000001
comparing

5726.159 --> 5731.04
right yeah gaining wisdom yeah it is

5728.0 --> 5731.04
about the delivery

5731.76 --> 5736.4800000000005
and if you no but it's also because of

5734.32 --> 5738.96
the devastating nature of the

5736.48 --> 5741.5199999999995
information

5738.96 --> 5744.32
right can you just this very bizarre

5741.52 --> 5745.6
example but can you imagine

5744.32 --> 5747.04
like

5745.6 --> 5750.56
typical

5747.04 --> 5752.719
war scenario and then like oh

5750.56 --> 5754.639
somebody goes to the house
