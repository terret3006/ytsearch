weather today is a little

92.0 --> 98.96
different it's much more windy

95.84 --> 100.0
i think it's a bit warmer again hasn't

98.96 --> 103.83999999999999
really rained much

100.0 --> 103.84
but it has been clouded a lot

112.84 --> 117.92
so

114.88 --> 121.119
all right but it's yeah still cooled off

117.92 --> 121.119
compared to last week

121.6 --> 124.55999999999999
let me check though

127.04 --> 146.87900000000002
give it some fresh water

143.68 --> 146.87900000000002
yeah they're in the corner

166.55 --> 171.84
[Music]

168.84 --> 171.84
right

172.08 --> 179.20000000000002
it's wednesday the 23rd

175.68 --> 182.4
of june 2021

179.2 --> 188.319
man we're almost halfway the year

182.4 --> 188.31900000000002
just one more week how time is flying

190.159 --> 194.879
hello clutch bear first in chat good to

192.56 --> 194.879
see you

197.2 --> 213.83999999999997
how are you doing

214.319 --> 220.319
right so yesterday i was very flustered

218.0 --> 221.68
really stood out to me how much hope

220.319 --> 226.319
today will be less

221.68 --> 228.31900000000002
although i do feel kind of the same

226.319 --> 229.44
i think it's because of the healing

228.319 --> 232.56
phase

229.44 --> 235.439
my jaw is a lot better like it is now

232.56 --> 235.439
really improving

238.879 --> 242.72
but yeah it does give some side effects

240.959 --> 247.76
i just feel like my body

242.72 --> 247.76
is like in regeneration mode

248.08 --> 251.76000000000002
and that that kind of like draws some

250.4 --> 254.159
energy from me

251.76 --> 256.799
it's weird how that works so crave more

254.159 --> 258.88
for sleep too

256.799 --> 260.88
all right and i did have a good night's

258.88 --> 263.12
sleep so

260.88 --> 263.12
ah

267.12 --> 269.84000000000003
all right so

270.96 --> 275.52
yesterday was decently interesting

276.16 --> 279.84000000000003
flat earth debates of course

280.639 --> 285.84000000000003
and it was very active in uh well during

283.6 --> 288.72
the live show

285.84 --> 290.63899999999995
but i went for groceries pretty much

288.72 --> 294.56
some point and then when i came back

290.639 --> 294.56
the show was over

295.6 --> 301.6
i think was it yeah it was

298.88 --> 302.15999999999997
anyway it was a good show uh also a

301.6 --> 305.199
little

302.16 --> 308.72
funny thing infowars

305.199 --> 311.039
hey i still keep track of it

308.72 --> 312.08000000000004
sometimes it gets a bit boring i think

311.039 --> 315.52
because it's just

312.08 --> 318.24
so narrow political

315.52 --> 320.32
and yeah that's nothing i that it

318.24 --> 324.0
doesn't really mean that much to me

320.32 --> 327.59999999999997
i mean it's interesting as a study

324.0 --> 330.96
example but those people

327.6 --> 334.16
are not in my backyard right that's

330.96 --> 336.479
u.s stuff anyway

334.16 --> 336.47900000000004
uh

337.44 --> 341.6
right one thing that did stand out to me

339.52 --> 345.28
is that owen troyer was during

341.6 --> 346.08000000000004
alex jones show and he suddenly started

345.28 --> 350.84
talking about

346.08 --> 354.56
flat earth censorship like out of

350.84 --> 356.479
nowhere the whole rant about it

354.56 --> 358.16
he said like flat earth at least five

356.479 --> 360.15999999999997
times

358.16 --> 362.24
and all about yeah i might not agree

360.16 --> 363.36
with it but yeah they are being censored

362.24 --> 365.36
and narrowed down

363.36 --> 368.40000000000003
and it's about freedom of speech so yeah

365.36 --> 368.40000000000003
i appreciated that

371.039 --> 374.96
yeah it always stands out to me when i

372.88 --> 376.96
over at infowar somebody dropped some

374.96 --> 379.919
flat earth

376.96 --> 382.63899999999995
even from a baller perspective i i i do

379.919 --> 386.79999999999995
appreciate that

382.639 --> 387.759
so that was fun uh owen benjamin also

386.8 --> 391.199
went

387.759 --> 393.199
live yeah i don't catch him live anymore

391.199 --> 395.44
you know that only works for me when

393.199 --> 398.319
he's streaming live through youtube but

395.44 --> 401.44
that's not working right now

398.319 --> 405.03900000000004
but that was also very entertaining i

401.44 --> 405.039
watch it on bit shoot afterwards

406.84 --> 409.84
uh

412.88 --> 416.24
i think that's it pretty much

417.039 --> 421.599
right yeah kiwi life he was also live i

420.16 --> 423.84000000000003
didn't get on there though

421.599 --> 424.71999999999997
i stayed in chat i just didn't really

423.84 --> 429.039
feel like

424.72 --> 433.59900000000005
getting in there i was still feeling

429.039 --> 433.599
the same as i did during the show

435.039 --> 437.84
uh

443.36 --> 448.319
right it was a good opportunity for me

445.12 --> 450.639
also to get very me of course

448.319 --> 452.8
which is a lot of fun to do and when

450.639 --> 454.479
you're verbally present then it can be a

452.8 --> 465.84000000000003
little disruptive so

454.479 --> 465.84
it just stuck to chat

474.479 --> 481.599
so anybody out there

477.68 --> 484.72
speak up i'm up for subjects i'm

481.599 --> 484.71999999999997
up for inquiry

487.12 --> 492.08
i could like randomly start about

490.84 --> 494.96
something

492.08 --> 497.599
something esoteric it's just stood out

494.96 --> 497.599
to me that

498.4 --> 505.19899999999996
in the entire spectrum of

501.44 --> 506.0
like frequencies and the staircase is

505.199 --> 508.879
basically up

506.0 --> 510.879
and down i'm just noticing that in

508.879 --> 511.36
different fields a lot of people that

510.879 --> 513.519
are

511.36 --> 516.64
basically walking that staircase down

513.519 --> 520.479
through their methodology

516.64 --> 523.519
they are all not doing well

520.479 --> 526.5600000000001
in every field like the darkness

523.519 --> 530.9590000000001
is really like on

526.56 --> 530.959
on a lot of tension and it flusters them

531.839 --> 536.72
like they lose their grip on the

534.399 --> 538.959
situation because of it

536.72 --> 540.64
that's something that's like that's been

538.959 --> 543.5999999999999
sporadically happening

540.64 --> 544.72
for a while i'm noticing now that it

543.6 --> 548.24
seems to be

544.72 --> 550.72
growing almost in peak-like

548.24 --> 550.72
fashion

552.88 --> 558.16
so yeah it's a metaphor

555.92 --> 560.56
it's like they they're climbing down and

558.16 --> 563.76
they're now all gathering

560.56 --> 565.5999999999999
on this floor at the bottom of the

563.76 --> 569.279
staircase

565.6 --> 570.399
and yeah it seems like there could be a

569.279 --> 572.72
trap door

570.399 --> 574.08
or in the entire floor could be

572.72 --> 577.12
literally at some point

574.08 --> 578.48
falling down if there's enough people

577.12 --> 580.64
gathering there

578.48 --> 582.9590000000001
and they know it but they don't want to

580.64 --> 585.4399999999999
go and still people keep coming down

582.959 --> 587.3599999999999
that staircase

585.44 --> 588.8000000000001
and it's like they're all aware like

587.36 --> 591.519
this [ __ ] can literally

588.8 --> 593.04
fall from underneath us and we don't

591.519 --> 595.279
know where we're going to end up after

593.04 --> 595.279
that

596.88 --> 602.8
yeah it's esoteric it's also a metaphor

600.88 --> 606.32
but that's what it feels like for a

602.8 --> 606.3199999999999
while so it's like

607.12 --> 610.72
some of the dark people may literally or

609.68 --> 613.279
literally

610.72 --> 614.24
maybe metaphorically walking up to like

613.279 --> 618.32
a

614.24 --> 621.04
chopping block of some sort

618.32 --> 621.6
in the not too distant future and they

621.04 --> 623.8389999999999
can all

621.6 --> 625.0400000000001
feel it and they're all like oh god not

623.839 --> 627.6
me

625.04 --> 629.04
and some might be like oh yeah that's my

627.6 --> 632.5600000000001
designation

629.04 --> 633.4399999999999
in the program like that's the price i

632.56 --> 635.8389999999999
have to pay

633.44 --> 637.7600000000001
for all my goodies and my lollipops and

635.839 --> 640.24
fancy pants and

637.76 --> 642.48
all that power that i have used so they

640.24 --> 648.24
might simply just choose it

642.48 --> 648.24
because they were designated too right

650.959 --> 654.16
i've been up and down the ladder yeah

652.56 --> 658.16
drunken bullet for one one

654.16 --> 658.16
i don't mean a literal letter it's an

659.12 --> 664.48
it's more like an ethereal letter it's a

661.12 --> 664.48
ladder of the consciousness

666.16 --> 671.8389999999999
no matter yeah i know that for you it's

669.12 --> 671.839
not a metaphor

673.839 --> 679.9200000000001
doing some gardening or roof works

677.44 --> 679.9200000000001
painting

680.88 --> 689.8389999999999
yeah welcome to chad

697.519 --> 703.839
roofing right

714.839 --> 717.839
hmm

745.279 --> 752.48
hey agm good to see you

749.12 --> 754.399
right so yeah i'm i'm already done

752.48 --> 758.32
for my report i've been very just

754.399 --> 763.6
relaxed and

758.32 --> 763.6
healing taking it easy

764.32 --> 769.6
i think i might be doing my last

766.399 --> 769.6
newspaper around

770.24 --> 776.0
for this thing today

773.839 --> 778.32
at least their their front page doesn't

776.0 --> 780.48
have some freaking corona or vaccine

778.32 --> 782.0
[ __ ] on it

780.48 --> 787.839
so i'm not just gonna toss it in the

782.0 --> 787.839
paper bin

796.399 --> 801.839
all right

814.16 --> 820.3199999999999
all right agm you were like a

817.76 --> 820.3199999999999
roofer

823.519 --> 829.12
right so drunken bullet and agm could

826.88 --> 831.36
potentially be colleagues like one would

829.12 --> 834.639
be doing the

831.36 --> 838.399
the woodworks underneath it the support

834.639 --> 838.399
and agm would be doing the

838.72 --> 845.6800000000001
the roof topping like the the cover

843.44 --> 845.6800000000001
right

850.72 --> 854.0
i've seen some roofing happening out

852.56 --> 858.56
there too by the way

854.0 --> 858.56
now that you mention it several places

859.04 --> 864.639
so it seems like it's the time of the

861.04 --> 864.639
year to update your roof

866.24 --> 870.0
to get out the rotten wood and to

868.959 --> 873.1199999999999
replace everything

870.0 --> 873.12
etc etc

878.32 --> 889.12
right so yay roofing

885.44 --> 889.12
it's raining over there all right

893.04 --> 899.8389999999999
not so much here

927.519 --> 930.48
right we're getting some

931.36 --> 936.8000000000001
roofed roofers talk in the chat

938.24 --> 945.12
i've never been a roofer by the way so

942.24 --> 946.639
because i don't know i don't do too

945.12 --> 948.399
great with heights

946.639 --> 952.8
probably could learn to get over it but

948.399 --> 952.8
it it never was very appealing to me

953.44 --> 956.0790000000001
because of that

957.11 --> 960.2
[Music]

964.639 --> 972.24
but like the work itself that

968.079 --> 972.2399999999999
that seems like could be a lot of fun

973.199 --> 987.12
like you're not gonna get bored at least

983.12 --> 987.12
fell through them twice what

994.839 --> 999.36
okay

996.72 --> 999.36
all right

1002.48 --> 1011.839
welcome to rufus early bird show

1015.85 --> 1019.129
[Music]

1022.839 --> 1030.079
yeah good

1024.959 --> 1030.079
i mean not good but yeah thanks

1036.48 --> 1041.439
right well yeah in case that sort of

1039.039 --> 1042.0
[ __ ] happens any good roofer will always

1041.439 --> 1045.039
have

1042.0 --> 1049.199
like rock climbers

1045.039 --> 1049.199
have good rope security works

1049.52 --> 1053.84
always be safe when you're roofing

1062.08 --> 1069.1999999999998
right so you have scaffolding

1065.28 --> 1069.2
scaffolding is it i know

1069.76 --> 1072.799
and rope security and then things should

1072.08 --> 1076.1599999999999
be all right

1072.799 --> 1078.08
okay now let's move on

1076.16 --> 1081.8400000000001
let's talk about how the world's going

1078.08 --> 1081.84
maz oh

1082.24 --> 1085.919
is it is it really go mad yeah i guess

1085.36 --> 1088.4799999999998
it is

1085.919 --> 1088.48
in ways

1092.08 --> 1109.84
or rather it's being pushed to go mad

1115.84 --> 1118.9599999999998
right but hey if you want to bring up

1117.52 --> 1120.8799999999999
something specific

1118.96 --> 1123.1200000000001
i'm open for it right i'm pretty much a

1120.88 --> 1125.6000000000001
clean slate

1123.12 --> 1126.1599999999999
clean enough to even just talk about

1125.6 --> 1129.9189999999999
freaking

1126.16 --> 1129.919
roofing for a few moments

1134.48 --> 1138.16
right but yeah you say the world's going

1137.679 --> 1143.44
mad

1138.16 --> 1145.6000000000001
that's like that's not a subject

1143.44 --> 1146.64
that's like pointing at what is it like

1145.6 --> 1148.48
25

1146.64 --> 1149.679
of all things happening in the world or

1148.48 --> 1152.559
something you know just like

1149.679 --> 1152.5590000000002
could mean anything

1158.96 --> 1165.8400000000001
fell through into the kitchen oh [ __ ]

1169.919 --> 1172.88
hey tom parker

1175.36 --> 1179.84
palm scanners

1182.48 --> 1185.84
no i have not seen those

1190.64 --> 1194.0800000000002
or what i have heard by the way is that

1193.28 --> 1197.28
i don't know if

1194.08 --> 1200.96
how much weight you should hang on it

1197.28 --> 1201.28
that supposedly the mask mandate might

1200.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
be

1201.28 --> 1207.84
lifting in england hooray

1211.6 --> 1215.12
yeah but what's going down in the u.s i

1213.44 --> 1216.24
don't know man it only seems to be

1215.12 --> 1219.84
getting worse

1216.24 --> 1222.799
they're like really pushing

1219.84 --> 1225.4399999999998
but in the netherlands i there's like a

1222.799 --> 1227.52
lot of talk of like oh vaccine passport

1225.44 --> 1231.679
and [ __ ]

1227.52 --> 1233.76
but they're certainly not

1231.679 --> 1235.3600000000001
they there's just a lot of political

1233.76 --> 1237.76
push talk

1235.36 --> 1239.9189999999999
like they want to mandate it they want

1237.76 --> 1239.919
to

1240.799 --> 1243.9189999999999
say like oh if you don't take it you're

1242.559 --> 1247.039
like an outcast

1243.919 --> 1249.2800000000002
like but there's no actual moves

1247.039 --> 1252.4
happening there's no places where you're

1249.28 --> 1255.039
literally being forced like that

1252.4 --> 1256.4
people seem to be very well aware here

1255.039 --> 1263.84
like

1256.4 --> 1263.8400000000001
that that's basically illegal

1264.799 --> 1267.84
but that's over here that's what i'm

1266.24 --> 1268.72
experiencing right i'm not seeing

1267.84 --> 1272.1589999999999
anybody getting

1268.72 --> 1272.559
forced like in the beginning like a year

1272.159 --> 1276.0
ago

1272.559 --> 1277.76
more when masks started nonsense

1276.0 --> 1279.12
started up like yeah there were like

1277.76 --> 1281.039
carrots and they were

1279.12 --> 1283.12
put on your mask put on your mouth i'm

1281.039 --> 1286.96
not seeing that hair anymore

1283.12 --> 1288.2399999999998
at all like at all you might see people

1286.96 --> 1291.6000000000001
discussing about

1288.24 --> 1294.64
wearing a mask not a mask but there's

1291.6 --> 1296.7199999999998
like no more anxiety now

1294.64 --> 1298.4
nobody's being forced here there's just

1296.72 --> 1300.96
some people that still wear it

1298.4 --> 1301.76
and others that don't and nobody's

1300.96 --> 1304.72
pushing around

1301.76 --> 1305.039
anymore really so i'm very relieved to

1304.72 --> 1308.4
see

1305.039 --> 1309.28
that change but that's over here that's

1308.4 --> 1312.72
what i'm

1309.28 --> 1312.72
experiencing when i go out

1314.88 --> 1320.88
right there might still be places

1318.72 --> 1323.44
where yeah it's like oh you've got to

1320.88 --> 1325.44
wear a mask to get in here

1323.44 --> 1326.72
like special boy clubs or whatever i

1325.44 --> 1329.8400000000001
don't know

1326.72 --> 1333.84
i don't even try

1329.84 --> 1333.84
don't really care about that

1341.52 --> 1347.84
they get a print of your palm

1351.36 --> 1357.039
but your palm what kind of data is in

1354.4 --> 1357.039
your palm

1358.84 --> 1361.84
what

1372.84 --> 1375.84
what

1376.24 --> 1391.679
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

1389.28 --> 1393.28
but agm what do you mean do you mean

1391.679 --> 1395.3600000000001
they scan your phone or

1393.28 --> 1403.84
literally the palm of your head i don't

1395.36 --> 1403.84
get this

1415.6 --> 1420.32
okay scan your hand

1418.05 --> 1422.0
[Music]

1420.32 --> 1423.36
oh so they're also scanning your

1422.0 --> 1427.039
fingerprint you mean

1423.36 --> 1429.9189999999999
right because if it's

1427.039 --> 1430.559
just like this part of your hand like i

1429.919 --> 1434.4
don't see

1430.559 --> 1434.3999999999999
what they're gonna get out of that

1434.96 --> 1448.64
that's the palm of your hand

1445.6 --> 1450.9599999999998
okay so there well yeah hey

1448.64 --> 1452.3200000000002
pam cow so they're taking your

1450.96 --> 1454.08
fingerprint then

1452.32 --> 1456.72
right that's relevant information

1454.08 --> 1462.559
because that is

1456.72 --> 1462.559
like registry that's identification

1464.48 --> 1470.48
wow so you're saying there's no

1467.52 --> 1473.679
supermarkets that require identification

1470.48 --> 1476.159
to get in

1473.679 --> 1476.159
sheesh

1485.679 --> 1501.8400000000001
that's creepy

1507.58 --> 1510.71
[Music]

1515.279 --> 1519.039
i mean for example i could i could

1517.36 --> 1521.039
imagine that for whatever reason

1519.039 --> 1522.559
non-corona related

1521.039 --> 1524.24
you would potentially want

1522.559 --> 1527.52
identification for

1524.24 --> 1528.0
customers that get in if it's like a

1527.52 --> 1530.1589999999999
really

1528.0 --> 1531.039
expensive merchandise store or something

1530.159 --> 1534.5590000000002
you know first

1531.039 --> 1536.96
for security insurance reasons maybe

1534.559 --> 1539.52
but just a regular supermarket that's

1536.96 --> 1539.52
insane

1540.32 --> 1543.84
like what

1549.12 --> 1552.7199999999998
huh what's that agent

1554.08 --> 1558.48
is that a video in which they do that

1558.72 --> 1571.84
okay check it out

1562.64 --> 1571.8400000000001
palm scanners right

1575.2 --> 1579.52
oh christ the thing is full of ads

1579.12 --> 1583.12
that's

1579.52 --> 1585.84
really annoying it's like the third one

1583.12 --> 1585.84
now

1588.559 --> 1595.039
okay well so far i'm only seeing

1592.32 --> 1595.039
cgi

1596.559 --> 1599.84
where's this

1603.44 --> 1606.64
and still footage

1611.6 --> 1617.84
so i'm not actually i'm seeing it

1615.279 --> 1619.12
being showed like this is here i'm not

1617.84 --> 1621.1999999999998
actually seeing

1619.12 --> 1622.799
a situation where there's a line of

1621.2 --> 1624.64
people and they use it

1622.799 --> 1626.8799999999999
so it doesn't seem to be implemented

1624.64 --> 1629.5200000000002
just yet according to this video

1626.88 --> 1629.5200000000002
just saying

1630.799 --> 1638.24
hey jim coffee

1634.799 --> 1641.84
all right hello andrew stallion8012

1638.24 --> 1641.84
good to see you

1643.919 --> 1647.919
oh stallion 82 stop it you don't have to

1646.399 --> 1652.0
apologize

1647.919 --> 1652.0
dude it was quite clear what was going

1652.84 --> 1655.84
on

1659.44 --> 1664.159
somebody was just a little oversensitive

1661.6 --> 1664.1589999999999
that's all

1665.36 --> 1670.32
not you all right

1670.88 --> 1676.3990000000001
what's the girl on the super yeah i

1672.48 --> 1678.48
watched it i scrolled through it agm

1676.399 --> 1680.08
it's just sitting there there's not a

1678.48 --> 1682.24
line of people using it

1680.08 --> 1683.279
so it's just like yeah look we got this

1682.24 --> 1685.039
thing here

1683.279 --> 1686.799
this is what we're supposed to use it

1685.039 --> 1690.48
for so that means it's not actually

1686.799 --> 1693.279
implemented yet they just got the device

1690.48 --> 1694.72
in preparation that's what the video

1693.279 --> 1697.84
when i scrolled through it

1694.72 --> 1697.84
seems to be about

1700.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
do you understand what i'm saying again

1718.0 --> 1724.48
amazon want to store biometric

1721.12 --> 1727.039
data in the cloud what

1724.48 --> 1727.039
the [ __ ]

1728.24 --> 1735.2
that's crazy why would they do that

1732.24 --> 1735.76
this biometric data is like security

1735.2 --> 1738.159
data

1735.76 --> 1740.559
you don't don't just throw that in a

1738.159 --> 1740.5590000000002
cloud

1741.6 --> 1745.6789999999999
that's a security breach waiting to

1750.84 --> 1756.9599999999998
happen

1752.64 --> 1756.96
that's what

1762.799 --> 1768.72
but like that's

1766.0 --> 1770.399
a situation where literally the secret

1768.72 --> 1772.88
service should be coming

1770.399 --> 1775.12
to them and saying like uh you can't do

1772.88 --> 1775.1200000000001
this

1776.88 --> 1782.5590000000002
you are going to violate the rights of

1779.84 --> 1782.559
these people

1784.799 --> 1792.96
and compromise security systems

1788.88 --> 1796.24
so that seems quite crazy is that real

1792.96 --> 1796.24
or is it just a bluff

1797.2 --> 1800.3990000000001
is it something they say they are

1798.88 --> 1802.3200000000002
implementing or

1800.399 --> 1809.84
they are saying just like no we want to

1802.32 --> 1809.84
do that you know

1819.919 --> 1823.6000000000001
ah right pamko okay so they are

1822.559 --> 1827.2
implementing it

1823.6 --> 1830.799
as store policy then right that's

1827.2 --> 1834.72
see that's how it starts store policy

1830.799 --> 1838.0
so that means yeah

1834.72 --> 1841.2
it's not a law they're just doing it as

1838.0 --> 1851.84
part of the store policy

1841.2 --> 1851.8400000000001
nobody that you can't stop that

1857.519 --> 1864.08
but as far as go as far as storing

1861.36 --> 1865.799
biometric data even fingerprint data in

1864.08 --> 1868.8799999999999
a cloud setup that's

1865.799 --> 1872.32
irresponsible because clouds are not

1868.88 --> 1876.3200000000002
secure they are not secure

1872.32 --> 1876.32
they can't be secure they're clouds

1876.559 --> 1880.72
they're literally literally anybody

1878.32 --> 1883.4399999999998
could just tap into it

1880.72 --> 1883.44
very easily

1883.84 --> 1888.8799999999999
you don't have to be a lead hacksaw to

1886.159 --> 1888.88
to do that

1889.44 --> 1893.8400000000001
hey neil cosentino good to see you

1894.96 --> 1900.159
he is still here what yeah i'm still

1897.919 --> 1900.159
here

1900.559 --> 1904.32
for the next hour and 20 minutes at

1904.84 --> 1907.84
least

1911.519 --> 1918.84
i hate clouds well computer clouds

1915.36 --> 1922.399
yes oh aji right

1918.84 --> 1924.6399999999999
yeah your fabulous uh brother-in-law

1922.399 --> 1924.6399999999999
right

1928.64 --> 1933.919
right well neil don't worry about it

1931.76 --> 1936.8799999999999
he's only going to stay until the

1933.919 --> 1936.88
lockdowns end

1946.84 --> 1949.84
right

1952.24 --> 1956.159
i hope you realize though that

1954.08 --> 1956.8799999999999
likelihood that lockdowns are never

1956.159 --> 1960.8400000000001
going to end

1956.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
since you live in new york so yeah good

1960.84 --> 1963.84
luck

1969.039 --> 1977.84
sorry i couldn't help it i had to i had

1972.0 --> 1977.84
to joke with it

1988.84 --> 1995.4399999999998
hmm but yeah drunken bullet

1992.32 --> 1997.6789999999999
clouds like computer information clouds

1995.44 --> 2000.72
on the internet

1997.679 --> 2002.72
well it's like this

2000.72 --> 2004.08
piece of paper that you can just write

2002.72 --> 2006.48
[ __ ] on and everybody

2004.08 --> 2007.279
can reach it if they have the entrance

2006.48 --> 2010.559
code

2007.279 --> 2012.0
but nothing is or the link right but

2010.559 --> 2015.519
nothing would prevent

2012.0 --> 2019.6
people from just finding that link

2015.519 --> 2021.519
or find it on somebody else's browser

2019.6 --> 2023.4399999999998
right it's just like oh this is the link

2021.519 --> 2023.84
to the cloud they just need that code

2023.44 --> 2026.0800000000002
and

2023.84 --> 2028.48
that now it's theirs now they can just

2026.08 --> 2030.96
get on it

2028.48 --> 2032.48
unless the cloud has some specific

2030.96 --> 2036.32
security

2032.48 --> 2036.799
clearance system of course but still

2036.32 --> 2040.08
yeah

2036.799 --> 2041.2
hackers can potentially bypass that i

2040.08 --> 2043.9189999999999
don't know maybe the

2041.2 --> 2044.88
the security issues have been partially

2043.919 --> 2047.919
resolved but

2044.88 --> 2048.56
when the icloud idea first came on there

2047.919 --> 2052.159
was just

2048.56 --> 2055.679
major security issues with it

2052.159 --> 2057.52
it's like very insecure

2055.679 --> 2060.2400000000002
i don't know if that's changed but still

2057.52 --> 2062.8
it does just overall it seems very

2060.24 --> 2065.919
unwise to start storing biometric data

2062.8 --> 2069.8390000000004
and such things like security data

2065.919 --> 2073.1189999999997
on a system that was very insecure

2069.839 --> 2077.119
from the start right

2073.119 --> 2079.9190000000003
because the idea of just a note block

2077.119 --> 2083.359
icloud thing like i've used that for

2079.919 --> 2083.359
dungeon dragons for example

2083.44 --> 2088.0
just as a note pad like write down [ __ ]

2086.8 --> 2089.52
to remember it

2088.0 --> 2090.639
and then you could always look it up on

2089.52 --> 2091.359
the internet you didn't need the

2090.639 --> 2093.2000000000003
physical

2091.359 --> 2095.44
need didn't need to write it down on the

2093.2 --> 2098.0
physical paper and then

2095.44 --> 2098.88
not lose that piece of paper right but

2098.0 --> 2100.96
that's because

2098.88 --> 2103.2000000000003
like yeah it's just notes about what we

2100.96 --> 2104.4
did in dnd that's not like oh yeah

2103.2 --> 2107.1189999999997
everybody in the world

2104.4 --> 2109.839
could hack that that's fine no problem

2107.119 --> 2112.0
you know it's just

2109.839 --> 2113.04
what we did as players that's it there's

2112.0 --> 2116.16
no problem with

2113.04 --> 2120.16
doesn't have to be that secure right

2116.16 --> 2123.2
well for that it's pretty cool system

2120.16 --> 2125.7599999999998
i think like it's not like oh ban

2123.2 --> 2128.3199999999997
all cloud systems it's just like don't

2125.76 --> 2128.32
use it

2128.839 --> 2137.119
involving things that require

2132.16 --> 2137.1189999999997
security that's it

2142.839 --> 2145.839
anyway

2146.079 --> 2150.48
use it to save games right well yeah

2150.88 --> 2159.839
right why not

2184.839 --> 2187.839
uh

2194.48 --> 2201.2
well pam cowell that depends

2197.599 --> 2205.04
you see if you open up

2201.2 --> 2208.96
a thing a page or whatever

2205.04 --> 2210.72
space on the cloud then you're the one

2208.96 --> 2214.0
that are going to have to

2210.72 --> 2214.48
install or set the security for it if

2214.0 --> 2216.48
you do

2214.48 --> 2217.92
if you just don't do that or you don't

2216.48 --> 2222.16
even know that that

2217.92 --> 2226.839
you should then it's not secure

2222.16 --> 2229.5989999999997
see so it all depends on who's using the

2226.839 --> 2233.2799999999997
cloud

2229.599 --> 2237.119
but still yeah it's because it's

2233.28 --> 2237.119
there's no real physical yeah

2239.68 --> 2245.52
it's just not fully secure yet

2243.359 --> 2247.92
it might never get that like that i

2245.52 --> 2250.16
don't know i'm not a hacker

2247.92 --> 2252.16
i'm not super up to date i've only got

2250.16 --> 2253.44
superficial glimpses from what has been

2252.16 --> 2258.0
happening out there and i have

2253.44 --> 2258.0
interests like

2258.24 --> 2265.2
the rough it developments

2262.079 --> 2267.76
even though i'm not a programmer i i do

2265.2 --> 2269.4399999999996
like keep track of that sort of like

2267.76 --> 2270.6400000000003
what is happening how is it happening

2269.44 --> 2274.4
how is it developing

2270.64 --> 2277.04
are there problems i'm specifically

2274.4 --> 2279.839
interested in the problems

2277.04 --> 2279.839
when they arrive

2281.28 --> 2285.599
because i'm just interested in the

2282.72 --> 2288.0
overall development and how that works

2285.599 --> 2288.0
anyway

2292.24 --> 2299.839
half the time the company running the

2293.92 --> 2299.839
cloud licks your info

2341.04 --> 2355.839
yes cow indeed

2366.839 --> 2369.839
so

2380.839 --> 2383.839
uh

2408.839 --> 2411.839
so

2416.16 --> 2420.72
right so yeah i guess we'll just see

2418.64 --> 2423.2799999999997
where that's gonna lead like if amazon's

2420.72 --> 2425.4399999999996
gonna do all this

2423.28 --> 2427.6800000000003
we'll just see what it'll do to them you

2425.44 --> 2429.839
know it might turn out to be a giant

2427.68 --> 2432.56
disaster move

2429.839 --> 2435.119
that like nobody wants it and that

2432.56 --> 2435.119
people are

2435.599 --> 2439.44
that before just did it for the

2437.839 --> 2443.44
convenience

2439.44 --> 2445.599
and because it was cheap and quick

2443.44 --> 2447.76
that they're now just gonna say okay

2445.599 --> 2449.92
well if you're gonna be like this

2447.76 --> 2452.4
then i'm no longer gonna prefer you i'm

2449.92 --> 2455.52
gonna seek somewhere else

2452.4 --> 2459.44
unless like there's no alternative

2455.52 --> 2459.44
to find this one niche thing

2464.88 --> 2469.04
i would think so at least

2470.16 --> 2476.3999999999996
i don't know i don't even i i've never

2473.28 --> 2476.4
ordered off amazon

2478.839 --> 2494.48
never

2481.119 --> 2498.6400000000003
i never needed to

2494.48 --> 2501.119
a while ago i did however try to

2498.64 --> 2503.2
engage like potentially publishing for

2501.119 --> 2506.1600000000003
amazon

2503.2 --> 2507.52
with like dnd game book that was trying

2506.16 --> 2510.56
to make

2507.52 --> 2513.2
but i never really got it complete

2510.56 --> 2516.319
like as a completely solo project i i

2513.2 --> 2520.0789999999997
just couldn't get it to work

2516.319 --> 2522.24
it didn't work technical problems like i

2520.079 --> 2524.88
would have to have

2522.24 --> 2526.56
a specialist that really knows about the

2524.88 --> 2530.319
publishing software and

2526.56 --> 2532.4
and their issues and i yeah

2530.319 --> 2534.839
it just didn't really work out and i

2532.4 --> 2537.839
kind of lost my motivation to continue

2534.839 --> 2537.839
it

2539.68 --> 2551.52
so technically i've never done anything

2541.76 --> 2554.88
with amazon

2551.52 --> 2556.88
amazon's rocket what

2554.88 --> 2559.119
rocket what are you talking about clutch

2556.88 --> 2559.119
bear

2561.839 --> 2565.359
are you saying amazon is now launching

2564.16 --> 2578.42
rockets

2565.359 --> 2581.5099999999998
what exactly are you talking about

2578.42 --> 2581.51
[Music]

2587.53 --> 2590.6490000000003
[Music]

2590.839 --> 2593.839
yes

2604.839 --> 2611.359
hey

2606.88 --> 2611.359
blue origin okay that's amazon

2612.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
or is it just sponsored by amazon like

2614.24 --> 2621.839
what what are you talking about

2626.46 --> 2629.619
[Music]

2638.88 --> 2645.119
ah right it's founded by jeff bezos

2646.839 --> 2651.92
okay it does seem separate though it's

2650.16 --> 2655.2799999999997
not

2651.92 --> 2657.359
it's just another company from him

2655.28 --> 2659.599
all right so he's into that [ __ ] too i

2657.359 --> 2659.5989999999997
guess

2660.4 --> 2663.92
was there some rocket launch that

2662.16 --> 2677.839
actually happened or is it just

2663.92 --> 2677.839
like yeah

2678.88 --> 2681.92
oh that thing yeah i think i have seen

2681.04 --> 2686.16
that

2681.92 --> 2686.16
in action sort of supposedly

2689.04 --> 2693.44
with another rocket that can land again

2695.68 --> 2704.24
and a separate separable capsule

2700.0 --> 2719.839
right has there been some action

2704.24 --> 2719.839
recently with this

2730.839 --> 2733.839
uh

2745.359 --> 2748.4
really fam cow

2753.28 --> 2757.28
like he's going in person

2758.839 --> 2761.839
really

2767.359 --> 2773.44
okay well that would be interesting to

2769.92 --> 2775.6800000000003
analyze it to say the least

2773.44 --> 2777.839
like is he actually is he actually

2775.68 --> 2780.48
stepping in the device or is it going to

2777.839 --> 2783.92
be trickery is it just some room

2780.48 --> 2786.079
suggest to be in that thing or whatever

2783.92 --> 2790.079
who knows man maybe he's really actually

2786.079 --> 2793.28
going to get in that device and do that

2790.079 --> 2797.04
although the flight into space

2793.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
of course is nonsense because yeah

2797.04 --> 2803.839
they can't get to space

2822.4 --> 2831.839
space is claimed what the hell are you

2824.96 --> 2831.839
blabbering about george sanford

2842.839 --> 2845.839
hmm

2867.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
really a hundred kilometers sure

2912.839 --> 2915.839
so

2920.96 --> 2925.76
dr evil's rocket ride his escape rocket

2926.839 --> 2929.839
right

2950.88 --> 2958.079
goody yeah

2954.88 --> 2960.8
billionaires and their rocket toys

2958.079 --> 2961.599
and their escape pods and their dr evil

2960.8 --> 2968.319
dreams

2961.599 --> 2968.319
yeah it's almost starting to turn into a

2968.839 --> 2971.839
trope

2981.51 --> 2984.739
[Music]

2996.839 --> 2999.839
so

3002.319 --> 3013.839
right anyway so

3006.0 --> 3013.839
let's see

3017.2 --> 3027.839
hmm nathan uploaded a video

3020.559 --> 3027.8390000000004
oh wait that was four hours ago uh

3031.04 --> 3040.72
can't wait to see at the edited clips

3034.72 --> 3042.7999999999997
right well yeah

3040.72 --> 3044.24
i don't see how they could do it without

3042.8 --> 3046.96
editing it

3044.24 --> 3046.9599999999996
at this point

3047.92 --> 3052.16
the way the playbook is designed for

3049.92 --> 3052.16
such

3052.839 --> 3055.839
theatrics

3060.48 --> 3064.8
pesos think space is space no tony wait

3064.24 --> 3067.839
come

3064.8 --> 3068.1600000000003
b dude like you really think somebody

3067.839 --> 3071.92
like

3068.16 --> 3074.16
bezos doesn't know that space is fake

3071.92 --> 3077.76
that's crazy you're not going to like

3074.16 --> 3077.7599999999998
start a company to do that

3079.04 --> 3083.839
if you really think it's real

3094.16 --> 3098.48
why do co-practitioners always block

3096.4 --> 3101.839
anyone who challenges

3098.48 --> 3102.96
well because they can't handle the

3101.839 --> 3106.88
challenge

3102.96 --> 3110.0
right they can't actually get into

3106.88 --> 3113.28
the inquiry

3110.0 --> 3115.76
the criticism that's why

3113.28 --> 3118.2400000000002
code practitioners tend to block right

3115.76 --> 3121.44
now whether they physically block them

3118.24 --> 3124.0789999999997
from speaking in a chat where they block

3121.44 --> 3128.079
it out of their mind

3124.079 --> 3128.079
all depends on the individual

3135.359 --> 3143.2799999999997
but yes what really makes a cult occult

3139.359 --> 3144.16
is that they actively have conditioning

3143.28 --> 3146.8
to block

3144.16 --> 3148.319
out certain information that conflicts

3146.8 --> 3152.48
with their

3148.319 --> 3154.88
trained beliefs

3152.48 --> 3157.44
so you can't get into the criticism yeah

3154.88 --> 3159.28
that's right

3157.44 --> 3163.28
if you're a co-practitioner you can't

3159.28 --> 3163.28
get into the criticism that's correct

3163.52 --> 3168.64
unless you somehow wanted to suggest

3166.48 --> 3169.119
that i am the cult practitioner even

3168.64 --> 3173.1189999999997
though i

3169.119 --> 3176.88
literally just addressed you

3173.119 --> 3181.119
right it just just addressed you

3176.88 --> 3185.04
as if you were asking a

3181.119 --> 3195.839
generally a general question

3185.04 --> 3195.839
right because i'm not taking your bait

3196.8 --> 3203.2000000000003
15-hour degree drift i block

3199.92 --> 3204.4
i don't block that no that 15-hour

3203.2 --> 3207.9199999999996
degree

3204.4 --> 3208.8
of the non-physical non-mechanical

3207.92 --> 3210.96
gyroscope

3208.8 --> 3212.88
definitely happened so yes yeah that

3210.96 --> 3215.359
that light there was a weird

3212.88 --> 3217.119
15 degree per hour light rotation was

3215.359 --> 3222.64
very weird though

3217.119 --> 3225.839
however the way it rotated

3222.64 --> 3229.839
very specifically on the z-axis

3225.839 --> 3230.72
right when the location where it was

3229.839 --> 3233.7599999999998
done

3230.72 --> 3236.16
was somewhere in the u.s so

3233.76 --> 3238.0
not the north or the south pole so it

3236.16 --> 3241.1189999999997
doesn't make any sense anyway

3238.0 --> 3244.079
and physical gyroscopes didn't do it

3241.119 --> 3245.92
it was just the ring laser one just the

3244.079 --> 3248.559
light rotation yeah

3245.92 --> 3252.4
so i don't avoid it i address it i

3248.559 --> 3252.4
explain it right there on the spot

3255.2 --> 3259.9199999999996
now are you going to face my rebuttal

3262.839 --> 3268.5589999999997
huh

3265.599 --> 3269.6800000000003
we're just gonna sink back into the

3268.559 --> 3279.8390000000004
swamp again

3269.68 --> 3279.839
forget dirt

3286.559 --> 3293.28
no now you're just lying it's not true

3290.16 --> 3295.839
you're just lying now there is no

3293.28 --> 3296.48
mechanical gyroscope 15 degree per hour

3295.839 --> 3306.88
drift

3296.48 --> 3309.68
that's just a lie

3306.88 --> 3310.2400000000002
you think i would i would just let you

3309.68 --> 3313.839
lie

3310.24 --> 3321.839
like that and not catch you

3313.839 --> 3321.839
it's ridiculous

3322.4 --> 3326.559
yeah i know ring laserjet yeah that's

3324.96 --> 3330.4
right

3326.559 --> 3331.28
the light deviated 15 degrees per hour

3330.4 --> 3333.839
even in a

3331.28 --> 3335.2000000000003
in a in the zero gauss chamber yeah

3333.839 --> 3339.04
that's right

3335.2 --> 3341.9199999999996
yeah not the physical one though

3339.04 --> 3344.4
only the light yeah the light rotated 15

3341.92 --> 3347.119
degrees per hour isn't it fascinating

3344.4 --> 3349.119
now how does it this prove that the

3347.119 --> 3351.28
earth spins

3349.119 --> 3353.52
when the mechanical gyroscope doesn't do

3351.28 --> 3353.52
that

3353.599 --> 3359.44
despite your foolish attempt to

3356.96 --> 3363.839
roll that lie in there like that

3359.44 --> 3363.839
actually happened and it didn't

3365.359 --> 3371.119
no why are you so eager to get blocked

3372.88 --> 3376.1600000000003
right i i don't need to block you i'm

3375.68 --> 3379.68
just

3376.16 --> 3382.0789999999997
going to refute your argument right

3379.68 --> 3384.0789999999997
because i'm not a cult leader i'm not

3382.079 --> 3387.119
desperate

3384.079 --> 3389.3590000000004
to martyr myself

3387.119 --> 3390.1600000000003
oh quick block me because my argument

3389.359 --> 3392.72
make no sense

3390.16 --> 3393.68
i need some form of apparent legitimacy

3392.72 --> 3395.68
oh

3393.68 --> 3398.5589999999997
yeah good luck with that i'm just going

3395.68 --> 3400.8799999999997
to address your argument

3398.559 --> 3400.88
huh

3402.88 --> 3406.2400000000002
i have blocked you many times yeah i'm

3405.119 --> 3410.079
sure i did

3406.24 --> 3410.0789999999997
but i don't need to right now

3414.16 --> 3419.04
right because i'm not really in the

3415.839 --> 3422.24
middle of something

3419.04 --> 3425.7599999999998
and i think it's funny because it's

3422.24 --> 3430.319
very obvious what you are

3425.76 --> 3432.2400000000002
you're a projecting little cultist

3430.319 --> 3435.2
isn't that just hilarious you're a

3432.24 --> 3438.319
projected little contest [ __ ] turd

3435.2 --> 3442.0789999999997
huh yeah thank bob

3438.319 --> 3445.04
chant for me thank bob yes do it do it

3442.079 --> 3446.0
thank him for his 15 degree light

3445.04 --> 3448.319
rotation

3446.0 --> 3449.04
when the physical gyro didn't thank him

3448.319 --> 3453.52
for that

3449.04 --> 3455.92
keep chanting do it

3453.52 --> 3458.4
is an established cult oh really based

3455.92 --> 3458.4
on what

3458.88 --> 3467.52
do we make claims of physical proof

3463.599 --> 3471.28
that turn out to be based on lies

3467.52 --> 3476.4
and misunderstandings no

3471.28 --> 3479.8390000000004
no we address the questions

3476.4 --> 3482.1600000000003
we work out the physics

3479.839 --> 3484.64
there's no cult established because a

3482.16 --> 3487.04
cult is based on a belief

3484.64 --> 3489.2
that ignores evidence that contradicts

3487.04 --> 3492.0
that belief from being true

3489.2 --> 3494.64
we don't do that that's your department

3492.0 --> 3494.64
baltard

3495.76 --> 3503.44
right because we address arguments you

3499.44 --> 3505.92
lie and bring us foolish

3503.44 --> 3507.92
arguments that are very easily refuted

3505.92 --> 3509.44
and then start chanting about how you

3507.92 --> 3511.28
are victorious

3509.44 --> 3512.48
now we recalled it we don't address the

3511.28 --> 3514.96
argument when that's just

3512.48 --> 3516.4
projection that's exactly what you're

3514.96 --> 3522.64
doing in my chat

3516.4 --> 3522.64
right now palpably provably to everyone

3523.119 --> 3526.799
so keep chanting for me fundy

3528.839 --> 3531.839
anti-intellectual

3533.28 --> 3537.0400000000004
yeah that's exactly what you are phuket

3536.24 --> 3540.8799999999997
word

3537.04 --> 3544.0
that you are perfectly projecting

3540.88 --> 3546.88
it's not 99 it's a hundred percent

3544.0 --> 3548.88
projection a group of anti-intellectuals

3546.88 --> 3551.839
making claims of physical proof

3548.88 --> 3552.4
based on lies and misunderstanding

3551.839 --> 3555.599
that's

3552.4 --> 3558.64
the ball religion for you it's a

3555.599 --> 3562.799
perfect perfect

3558.64 --> 3562.799
should print it out put it

3563.68 --> 3571.359
in a canvas this is art

3568.48 --> 3574.0
coming out of out of the cultist mouth

3571.359 --> 3576.4
isn't that just perfect

3574.0 --> 3578.72
and he's obsessed with being blocked

3576.4 --> 3578.7200000000003
it's just

3584.559 --> 3587.8390000000004
it's hilarious

3588.079 --> 3591.6800000000003
i'm not even fazed by this [ __ ] it's

3590.799 --> 3594.72
just

3591.68 --> 3597.839
funny it's funny to me

3594.72 --> 3600.8799999999997
your mental retardation

3597.839 --> 3602.0
and suffering through it suffering in

3600.88 --> 3604.96
the scenario of

3602.0 --> 3606.96
not being able to deal with reality and

3604.96 --> 3608.0
even the dynamics of the social

3606.96 --> 3610.96
situation

3608.0 --> 3613.52
is hilarious to me because i'm a bit of

3610.96 --> 3617.359
a sadist like that towards

3613.52 --> 3620.319
mentally [ __ ] people that behave

3617.359 --> 3621.119
obsessively like yourself i think it's

3620.319 --> 3624.0
funny

3621.119 --> 3624.96
you know why because of petty personal

3624.0 --> 3627.92
reasons because

3624.96 --> 3628.7200000000003
people like you made my life miserable

3627.92 --> 3631.119
in a time

3628.72 --> 3633.4399999999996
when it was very trusting towards the

3631.119 --> 3635.599
world and the good spirit of humanity

3633.44 --> 3636.7200000000003
i couldn't imagine that people could be

3635.599 --> 3640.2400000000002
like this

3636.72 --> 3642.799
like you and i was just like

3640.24 --> 3643.9199999999996
no you're you're acting so i would trust

3642.799 --> 3647.68
them

3643.92 --> 3650.559
because i believe they were better yeah

3647.68 --> 3651.2
and oh i have i come back from that [ __ ]

3650.559 --> 3655.3590000000004
yeah

3651.2 --> 3659.5989999999997
and as a result now i just enjoy

3655.359 --> 3662.799
your [ __ ] suffering and projected

3659.599 --> 3667.28
[ __ ] i love it i think it's funny

3662.799 --> 3669.68
i'm not desperate i'm exhilarated

3667.28 --> 3671.119
because you're so [ __ ] stupid and you

3669.68 --> 3673.9199999999996
just keep on going

3671.119 --> 3674.6400000000003
keep projecting please ban me please ban

3673.92 --> 3676.799
me

3674.64 --> 3678.96
because i just made the statement how

3676.799 --> 3680.319
cultists always block everybody that was

3678.96 --> 3682.64
my entry

3680.319 --> 3684.079
that was my entry so why aren't you

3682.64 --> 3687.2
doing it why are you

3684.079 --> 3690.2400000000002
addressing my arguments

3687.2 --> 3692.319
let me project some more summaries

3690.24 --> 3694.16
of what i think you are when that's

3692.319 --> 3699.44
exactly what you are

3694.16 --> 3703.2
yourself okay turd

3699.44 --> 3705.839
i'm so triggered i'm having a breakdown

3703.2 --> 3705.839
oh my god

3706.4 --> 3714.0
see guys i'm such i'm having a breakdown

3710.839 --> 3717.119
man i feel so bad

3714.0 --> 3718.88
because this guy is just calling it it's

3717.119 --> 3721.76
just describing me right

3718.88 --> 3724.799
it's not a hundred percent projection in

3721.76 --> 3724.7990000000004
every detail

3724.96 --> 3731.52
it's not just mirror talk it's me

3728.319 --> 3731.52
i'm i'm triggered

3732.319 --> 3738.48
this is terrible i'm so triggered man

3735.44 --> 3739.2000000000003
[ __ ] don't know what i'm gonna do with

3738.48 --> 3743.68
this

3739.2 --> 3743.68
anxiety and stress so triggered

3753.599 --> 3755.839
what

3763.68 --> 3767.2
what does that even mean secret globe

3765.68 --> 3769.839
agents

3767.2 --> 3769.839
what

3774.559 --> 3781.92
yeah i know i know forget her

3777.92 --> 3782.88
he picked up the gyroscope the light

3781.92 --> 3785.119
based

3782.88 --> 3785.92
gyroscope three times and it kept on

3785.119 --> 3788.2400000000002
drifting

3785.92 --> 3789.119
isn't that just special yes we know

3788.24 --> 3791.52
light

3789.119 --> 3792.2400000000002
light rotates 15 degrees per hour we

3791.52 --> 3795.119
know

3792.24 --> 3798.0
isn't it just special yeah yeah the

3795.119 --> 3801.76
mechanical gyroscope doesn't though

3798.0 --> 3804.48
baltard we know

3801.76 --> 3806.2400000000002
we know light rotates 15 degrees per

3804.48 --> 3811.2
hour yeah it's very special

3806.24 --> 3811.2
yeah the physical gyroscope didn't

3822.839 --> 3825.839
though

3829.44 --> 3839.839
keep chanting fundy

3840.079 --> 3842.4
all right

3848.799 --> 3852.48
yeah it's [ __ ] dude there is no

3850.72 --> 3856.24
freaking bald spot

3852.48 --> 3859.359
i have hair i will always have hair

3856.24 --> 3862.4799999999996
right it's not like

3859.359 --> 3864.88
like thick hair it's never been like

3862.48 --> 3866.72
that i'm not i don't have like african

3864.88 --> 3870.559
style hair

3866.72 --> 3875.52
yeah i'm 41 years old

3870.559 --> 3875.52
yeah it's it's been like this

3875.76 --> 3883.76
pretty much since i was what is it

3879.359 --> 3886.799
17 yeah it thinned out

3883.76 --> 3889.3590000000004
a little bit

3886.799 --> 3891.599
but yeah i don't know man i'm not going

3889.359 --> 3895.2
to be anywhere near bald

3891.599 --> 3898.1600000000003
before i reach 60.

3895.2 --> 3900.3999999999996
not have not nothing near that i'm not

3898.16 --> 3902.0
worried about it all

3900.4 --> 3903.52
i know there's nothing wrong with my

3902.0 --> 3909.119
hair

3903.52 --> 3912.24
it's just that it was mentioned

3909.119 --> 3913.52
yeah because i'm not worried i literally

3912.24 --> 3917.2
don't care i'm not

3913.52 --> 3920.64
insecure okay you [ __ ] baltard

3917.2 --> 3925.52
retards i literally don't care i'm not

3920.64 --> 3928.96
insecure about who i am what i look like

3925.52 --> 3934.079
i'm considered relatively attractive

3928.96 --> 3936.4
yeah i know even when i don't want to

3934.079 --> 3938.1600000000003
because it's sometimes it's very

3936.4 --> 3942.2400000000002
rewarding to be

3938.16 --> 3942.24
just completely undetected

3942.72 --> 3953.359
i've learned that from other people

3950.079 --> 3958.319
i'm just it's they they just oh

3953.359 --> 3961.7599999999998
look at that what did he say

3958.319 --> 3965.0389999999998
you are bald now oh i'm so bald

3961.76 --> 3968.3190000000004
i'm so bold

3965.039 --> 3971.039
scary i'm so

3968.319 --> 3971.0389999999998
afraid

3972.96 --> 3979.839
this is yes it's getting a bit boring

3976.88 --> 3979.839
now

3982.079 --> 3985.599
disagree with the bald attacks oh well

3984.72 --> 3989.7599999999998
thank you

3985.599 --> 3993.28
forget dirt for siding with me on that

3989.76 --> 3995.599
that's very nice of you

3993.28 --> 3997.6800000000003
he confirmed the girl oh you mean the

3995.599 --> 3998.1600000000003
leading edge of the sphere that you

3997.68 --> 4001.0389999999998
never

3998.16 --> 4002.24
claimed as a baller right you never

4001.039 --> 4006.079
claimed

4002.24 --> 4009.5989999999997
the horizon was earth curve

4006.079 --> 4010.6400000000003
but when jaren proved it it was still

4009.599 --> 4013.28
assumed to be

4010.64 --> 4013.2799999999997
earth curve

4018.839 --> 4021.839
right

4028.88 --> 4032.6400000000003
you think caveman was cool well if

4030.96 --> 4033.44
you're gonna do that sort of [ __ ] in my

4032.64 --> 4036.4
chat

4033.44 --> 4036.4
then you're not cool

4046.4 --> 4051.76
spheres don't have edges

4049.44 --> 4053.44
no they do spheres have an edge that's

4051.76 --> 4057.5200000000004
right

4053.44 --> 4057.52
the edge of when you look at them

4057.92 --> 4063.839
you look at the sphere now where the

4060.96 --> 4063.839
sphere

4065.119 --> 4068.7200000000003
no longer is the sphere when you look at

4067.44 --> 4070.7200000000003
it now

4068.72 --> 4072.18
if you actually have a sphere as an

4070.72 --> 4074.16
example freaking out

4072.18 --> 4077.44
[Music]

4074.16 --> 4079.5989999999997
where some spheres right let's take this

4077.44 --> 4079.599
one

4080.079 --> 4087.3590000000004
so we got a sphere right

4083.2 --> 4092.64
now when we're thinking geometry

4087.359 --> 4096.0
literal geometry then yeah

4092.64 --> 4099.199
a sphere doesn't have an edge because

4096.0 --> 4102.56
there is no literal corner because it's

4099.199 --> 4104.879999999999
a singular sphere if it would be like a

4102.56 --> 4105.679
20-sided dice yeah then it has many

4104.88 --> 4108.759
edges

4105.679 --> 4110.88
within the geometry right so

4108.759 --> 4115.279
geometrically

4110.88 --> 4118.400000000001
spheres don't have edges

4115.279 --> 4121.52
but there's other

4118.4 --> 4125.44
mediums yeah like optics

4121.52 --> 4128.64
and when you look at the sphere

4125.44 --> 4132.159
it has an edge

4128.64 --> 4135.279
the edge is where it blocks things

4132.159 --> 4139.199
behind it that's the

4135.279 --> 4142.0
edge of the sphere

4139.199 --> 4142.96
when you look at it right it's not a

4142.0 --> 4145.199
geometric

4142.96 --> 4146.08
edge it's not about the geometry of the

4145.199 --> 4148.96
shape and whether

4146.08 --> 4149.839
it has an edge anywhere or multiple

4148.96 --> 4153.6
edges in it

4149.839 --> 4156.719
right it's not about the edge of this

4153.6 --> 4160.0
geometric nature of the sphere no it's

4156.719 --> 4163.44
the edge of when you look at it

4160.0 --> 4167.6
look at the sphere where it blocks

4163.44 --> 4171.199
things behind it that's the edge

4167.6 --> 4172.56
this is the edge behind it it blocks

4171.199 --> 4177.3589999999995
things

4172.56 --> 4189.839000000001
from sight that's the edge of the sphere

4177.359 --> 4192.56
huh huh are you getting it yet

4189.839 --> 4192.88
yeah it is it is scientific stuff isn't

4192.56 --> 4197.52
it

4192.88 --> 4203.84
it's about meaning of words

4197.52 --> 4203.84
let me get a notepad yeah yeah

4209.84 --> 4215.12
it's just because ballers keep on

4212.08 --> 4218.48
blabbering nonsense

4215.12 --> 4219.199
spheres have no edges yeah spheres have

4218.48 --> 4222.4
an edge

4219.199 --> 4226.48
right yeah the geometry of the sphere

4222.4 --> 4229.5199999999995
doesn't have edges but the sphere

4226.48 --> 4232.639999999999
the physical sphere when you look at it

4229.52 --> 4235.76
it has an edge the edge is optical

4232.64 --> 4238.0
that's the edge of a sphere right it's

4235.76 --> 4240.400000000001
supposed to be blocking things behind it

4238.0 --> 4242.719
like i just demonstrated

4240.4 --> 4244.96
you think that's the earth you think

4242.719 --> 4248.159
that the earth is a sphere

4244.96 --> 4251.679
or when you look on

4248.159 --> 4254.719
at the sphere that sphere

4251.679 --> 4257.84
should have an edge blocking things

4254.719 --> 4260.159
behind it you used to call it earth

4257.84 --> 4264.96
curve

4260.159 --> 4267.839999999999
remember that remember when you called

4264.96 --> 4268.96
it earth curve it was supposed to be the

4267.84 --> 4271.6
edge of the sphere

4268.96 --> 4272.0
blocking things into the distance before

4271.6 --> 4273.4400000000005
you

4272.0 --> 4276.88
before it all went to hell with the

4273.44 --> 4279.919999999999
black swan you said you never claimed

4276.88 --> 4287.84
the horizon is earth curve etc etc

4279.92 --> 4287.84
remember that

4298.84 --> 4303.59
hmm

4300.49 --> 4303.59
[Music]

4308.91 --> 4315.36
[Music]

4312.159 --> 4317.839999999999
an unqualified youtube

4315.36 --> 4318.96
really what makes me a qualified

4317.84 --> 4321.679
youtuber

4318.96 --> 4322.08
now that's a new one guys did you hear

4321.679 --> 4326.2390000000005
fro

4322.08 --> 4329.12
turt called me an unqualified youtuber

4326.239 --> 4332.08
i didn't know i had to have a special

4329.12 --> 4335.92
paper to become a youtuber

4332.08 --> 4339.199
or to say that i'm doing science

4335.92 --> 4341.1990000000005
right i need to [ __ ] as long as you

4339.199 --> 4343.199
follow a certain playbook and just call

4341.199 --> 4344.879999999999
themselves a science and nobody's

4343.199 --> 4347.36
scientists nobody's going to do anything

4344.88 --> 4347.36
about it

4347.92 --> 4351.679
right well i don't follow that narrative

4350.48 --> 4355.199
but i can

4351.679 --> 4358.159
perform science and when i say

4355.199 --> 4359.759999999999
science i mean a scientific method

4358.159 --> 4364.239
empirical

4359.76 --> 4367.280000000001
method to prove the cause of an effect

4364.239 --> 4369.36
of a natural occurring phenomenon yeah

4367.28 --> 4370.08
that's doing science i know how to do

4369.36 --> 4373.28
that so

4370.08 --> 4374.4
i am technically qualified as a

4373.28 --> 4377.36
scientist

4374.4 --> 4377.92
it's just that i'm mostly a theorist

4377.36 --> 4381.36
right

4377.92 --> 4384.08
i deal with models but i have the

4381.36 --> 4385.36
scientific method available i know it i

4384.08 --> 4388.4
can utilize it i

4385.36 --> 4388.4
can distinguish

4389.12 --> 4392.239
i'm just doing fine

4393.199 --> 4397.36
also yeah knowing what science is the

4395.92 --> 4401.28
scientific method i

4397.36 --> 4404.48
i'm not just gonna call anything science

4401.28 --> 4406.48
right because it's just conceptual a lot

4404.48 --> 4409.599999999999
of things are conceptual

4406.48 --> 4412.879999999999
they're mind experiments they're

4409.6 --> 4414.400000000001
pieces of reasoning they're basically

4412.88 --> 4417.12
philosophy

4414.4 --> 4417.5199999999995
technically so in most things i don't

4417.12 --> 4420.88
claim

4417.52 --> 4424.080000000001
science i don't need to because i'm not

4420.88 --> 4425.6
insecure about what i do and where it's

4424.08 --> 4429.6
going

4425.6 --> 4434.56
i don't need to keep a safe blanket of

4429.6 --> 4438.8
science science right

4434.56 --> 4440.88
to cover for my activities

4438.8 --> 4443.28
but when i actually engage with

4440.88 --> 4444.08
something that it does involve actual

4443.28 --> 4447.12
science

4444.08 --> 4449.04
scientific method then i will call it

4447.12 --> 4455.84
science

4449.04 --> 4455.84
yeah that's how it works

4465.44 --> 4471.199
neurological item what

4468.96 --> 4472.4800000000005
i don't need more training for that does

4471.199 --> 4475.44
gosling

4472.48 --> 4478.0
i don't well s80 prep book don't know

4475.44 --> 4478.0
what that is

4480.84 --> 4486.08
whatever

4482.08 --> 4486.08
seeking star water see you

4489.44 --> 4497.12
what scientists have you consulted or

4492.32 --> 4500.0
worked with in your flat earth study

4497.12 --> 4500.0
consulted

4500.64 --> 4504.08
well i haven't really officially

4503.12 --> 4508.5599999999995
consulted

4504.08 --> 4510.64
scientists never really needed to

4508.56 --> 4513.280000000001
because i don't need somebody else to

4510.64 --> 4517.52
perform the scientific method

4513.28 --> 4520.719
no although if if i would ever make to

4517.52 --> 4521.92
would go to jesus the point where i

4520.719 --> 4525.92
would

4521.92 --> 4528.4
try to actually make a scientific claim

4525.92 --> 4529.6
and test the hypothesis then i do expect

4528.4 --> 4532.639999999999
other scientists

4529.6 --> 4536.0
to test it out and to also

4532.64 --> 4539.6
perform the experiment to confirm it

4536.0 --> 4542.719
or to disprove it whatever they want

4539.6 --> 4545.04
right as long as they do it right it

4542.719 --> 4549.12
should be correct

4545.04 --> 4552.56
so i don't

4549.12 --> 4556.159
i don't really inquire as to somebody's

4552.56 --> 4559.76
scientific background what i do do

4556.159 --> 4563.04
instead is just determine

4559.76 --> 4566.56
right on the spot what their skill

4563.04 --> 4569.199
range is i inquire

4566.56 --> 4571.360000000001
i research purely on a spiritual

4569.199 --> 4571.759999999999
intellectual level without talking about

4571.36 --> 4574.239
it

4571.76 --> 4575.84
what their skills are what they can

4574.239 --> 4578.959999999999
handle what they can do

4575.84 --> 4580.88
what they can uncover

4578.96 --> 4582.2390000000005
right it doesn't necessarily have to

4580.88 --> 4584.96
involve science

4582.239 --> 4587.36
but it all depends on how empirical

4584.96 --> 4589.84
minded are they how

4587.36 --> 4591.12
easily distracted by conceptions are

4589.84 --> 4593.52
they how

4591.12 --> 4595.92
much do they risk refining their

4593.52 --> 4597.92
conceptions into physical reality and

4595.92 --> 4601.04
their model of it

4597.92 --> 4604.32
right i inquire in all those things

4601.04 --> 4604.32
when i source

4605.199 --> 4608.799999999999
so i've talked to a lot of people that

4606.88 --> 4609.84
have probably performed some scientific

4608.8 --> 4612.96
experiments

4609.84 --> 4613.4400000000005
somewhere it's not really noteworthy you

4612.96 --> 4615.6
know

4613.44 --> 4616.719
like you can do science a scientific

4615.6 --> 4619.679
experiment if

4616.719 --> 4623.84
yeah to basically prove water boils it's

4619.679 --> 4623.84
super easy

4625.6 --> 4629.4400000000005
as a scientist how do tides work

4628.4 --> 4632.4
magnetic

4629.44 --> 4635.36
angel spoons cause them solar eclipse

4632.4 --> 4640.0
it's a celestial phenomena so

4635.36 --> 4640.0
we don't know nobody knows exactly

4640.08 --> 4643.6
how the optical effects of the

4642.56 --> 4646.719
celestials

4643.6 --> 4648.320000000001
happen like that we just know the cycles

4646.719 --> 4651.679
of them

4648.32 --> 4653.199
we don't know how though we just know

4651.679 --> 4656.96
the cycles

4653.199 --> 4656.96
everybody knows that pretty much at this

4662.84 --> 4668.400000000001
point

4665.28 --> 4669.92
i mostly make up no no i put things

4668.4 --> 4671.759999999999
together i don't make up

4669.92 --> 4673.6
and when i make something up i'll be

4671.76 --> 4676.320000000001
very clear about it

4673.6 --> 4678.08
and honest if i'm gonna make you

4676.32 --> 4681.759999999999
presuppose something i'll

4678.08 --> 4685.04
say it every time because i don't like

4681.76 --> 4688.400000000001
people to accidentally start reifying

4685.04 --> 4692.4
pure conceptions into physical reality

4688.4 --> 4696.5599999999995
if i'm going to have a train of thought

4692.4 --> 4698.96
in a very specific road of assumption

4696.56 --> 4701.280000000001
i will say it so that you don't

4698.96 --> 4704.719
mistakingly

4701.28 --> 4707.759999999999
start assuming things that yeah you

4704.719 --> 4712.08
don't have proof for

4707.76 --> 4714.0
i don't like people yeah that's right

4712.08 --> 4715.76
there's a lot about a lot of people that

4714.0 --> 4718.88
i don't like everybody has

4715.76 --> 4720.96
ability as traits i don't like i have

4718.88 --> 4724.2390000000005
traits that i don't like

4720.96 --> 4728.56
right still gonna have to deal with it

4724.239 --> 4728.5599999999995
so that's i don't see the problem here

4730.0 --> 4733.199
is there any anything else

4733.6 --> 4737.04
seems like the troll horde thinks they

4735.679 --> 4740.159
got a grip now there

4737.04 --> 4742.48
they can just do their thing here

4740.159 --> 4744.5599999999995
tides are caused by what please explain

4742.48 --> 4748.48
there i did an episode about it it has

4744.56 --> 4750.159000000001
it in the title tides are caused by

4748.48 --> 4752.239
angel spoons look it up

4750.159 --> 4754.48
watch it i'm not gonna explain it all

4752.239 --> 4754.48
here

4756.239 --> 4760.839999999999
because the water is magnetic no not

4758.56 --> 4762.080000000001
because water is magnetic because of

4760.84 --> 4765.52
magnetics

4762.08 --> 4770.64
it's a magnetic phenomena clearly

4765.52 --> 4776.320000000001
what transpires during the tides

4770.64 --> 4779.92
angel spoons oh so it sounds mad does it

4776.32 --> 4784.48
oh it sounds mad ah

4779.92 --> 4791.04
yeah i'm sorry it sounds mad

4784.48 --> 4793.919999999999
but that's what i chose to call it

4791.04 --> 4795.36
yeah yeah angel spoons it i called it

4793.92 --> 4799.36
angel's foods that's

4795.36 --> 4802.839999999999
my name that i gave it yeah

4799.36 --> 4806.0
hey hey it's not

4802.84 --> 4808.8
literal [ __ ]

4806.0 --> 4808.8
you didn't know that

4830.84 --> 4833.84
ugh

4835.84 --> 4840.400000000001
from working geometry i don't have any

4838.8 --> 4843.28
geometry problems

4840.4 --> 4843.28
dos gosling

4843.92 --> 4850.0
only baltards have geometry problems i

4848.08 --> 4854.32
don't

4850.0 --> 4856.32
baldwin me that can never let go

4854.32 --> 4858.159
the belief that the earth is a ball i

4856.32 --> 4859.28
have him contained in a golden cage

4858.159 --> 4861.36
within me

4859.28 --> 4862.48
because i am more than him but he is

4861.36 --> 4865.44
still in there

4862.48 --> 4867.199
yeah he doesn't even have a freaking

4865.44 --> 4870.08
geometry problem you

4867.199 --> 4871.839999999999
idiot because all the bald hearts are

4870.08 --> 4875.88
tarts

4871.84 --> 4878.88
they're literally left behind

4875.88 --> 4882.08
[ __ ] right i'm not

4878.88 --> 4886.8
not being offensive i'm being literal

4882.08 --> 4890.08
baltards are [ __ ] they're behind

4886.8 --> 4891.92
they're slow because i ballwin

4890.08 --> 4893.44
i know there's just a curve function

4891.92 --> 4896.0
collapse right

4893.44 --> 4896.799999999999
why would you worry about geometry

4896.0 --> 4899.52
because when you

4896.8 --> 4900.8
when you physically measure it when you

4899.52 --> 4902.88
detect it

4900.8 --> 4904.8
when you analyze it the curve function

4902.88 --> 4906.8
collapse it's all flat so why would you

4904.8 --> 4909.04
worry about the geometry

4906.8 --> 4909.84
when everything is going to turn out to

4909.04 --> 4913.28
be flat

4909.84 --> 4913.28
anyway right

4913.6 --> 4919.6
curve function collapse i don't have

4916.4 --> 4919.599999999999
geometry problems

4920.719 --> 4925.28
okay yeah now you're going goodbye

4925.6 --> 4931.84
it was fun while it lasted

4940.719 --> 4945.199
thank you stalin812 i appreciate that

4943.6 --> 4948.320000000001
you appreciate the

4945.199 --> 4951.36
artistic thing that i did

4948.32 --> 4951.36
by choosing that name

4951.679 --> 4958.96
right and it's not even that it's not

4955.199 --> 4960.879999999999
even whimsical i chose an angel spoon

4958.96 --> 4962.8
for a good reason because that's kind of

4960.88 --> 4966.400000000001
what it looks like to me

4962.8 --> 4967.84
an ethereal spoon in every tight

4966.4 --> 4972.48
location that's just

4967.84 --> 4975.4400000000005
staring the water around like a spoon

4972.48 --> 4977.759999999999
it's i chose angel spoon for a good

4975.44 --> 4977.759999999999
reason

4982.88 --> 4988.719
you could physic math and physical

4985.6 --> 4988.719
logical reasoning

4988.88 --> 4995.6
so could you yeah i have i have

4993.04 --> 4998.32
i'm not going with a knee-jerk reaction

4995.6 --> 5000.4800000000005
now you're projecting dos gosling

4998.32 --> 5003.199
that's exactly what you're doing all of

5000.48 --> 5006.4
every dude i have a show

5003.199 --> 5007.919999999999
i've had over 10 000 hours of live

5006.4 --> 5015.04
experience

5007.92 --> 5019.52
you think this is a knee-jerk reaction

5015.04 --> 5022.8
really no i know exactly what i'm doing

5019.52 --> 5022.8
this is not random

5024.639 --> 5043.84
you're having a jerk reaction because

5026.639 --> 5043.84
you can't face the facts

5056.0 --> 5060.32
i wonder now is it actually 10 000 hours

5061.44 --> 5068.5599999999995
is there even like a like a stat

5064.96 --> 5071.84
for that i don't know but i know it's

5068.56 --> 5071.84
this channel's been out here for

5073.4 --> 5078.879999999999
56 years at least

5076.88 --> 5080.56
something like that and yeah i have a

5078.88 --> 5082.96
daily show

5080.56 --> 5085.120000000001
thousand episodes so that's a thousand

5082.96 --> 5088.2390000000005
times

5085.12 --> 5091.84
one and a half hour two hours

5088.239 --> 5094.879999999999
right that's at least 2 000 hours

5091.84 --> 5098.400000000001
and yeah okay maybe 10

5094.88 --> 5101.679
000 is a little bit much right

5098.4 --> 5101.679
thousands of hours still

5103.199 --> 5105.839999999999
it's enough

5111.6 --> 5115.52
yeah dude get the [ __ ] out of here you

5114.0 --> 5118.719
[ __ ] baltard

5115.52 --> 5121.360000000001
piece of [ __ ] projecting [ __ ]

5118.719 --> 5121.36
[ __ ] off

5122.0 --> 5128.4
i am a psychiatrist you [ __ ]

5125.199 --> 5130.5599999999995
walnut [ __ ] i don't know where the

5128.4 --> 5132.638999999999
walnut came from whatever

5130.56 --> 5135.120000000001
just i'm done with you retards get the

5132.639 --> 5135.12
[ __ ] out

5135.679 --> 5140.6
i've let you made a complete buffoon of

5138.8 --> 5143.6
yourself by

5140.6 --> 5147.52
blatantly showing 100

5143.6 --> 5150.96
projection of your predicament onto me

5147.52 --> 5152.159000000001
i refuted it i refuted every damn thing

5150.96 --> 5156.0
you said

5152.159 --> 5158.48
in every possible conceivable detail

5156.0 --> 5160.719
and now your time up is up here i'm done

5158.48 --> 5163.28
with your retards get the [ __ ] out

5160.719 --> 5163.28
all of you

5165.76 --> 5172.320000000001
get a [ __ ] life i'm never

5168.8 --> 5176.0
going away i'm gonna do this every

5172.32 --> 5178.239
day yeah

5176.0 --> 5180.4
until you're all dead from your [ __ ]

5178.239 --> 5185.28
vaccine spike protein

5180.4 --> 5188.08
poisoning yeah you pieces of [ __ ] scum

5185.28 --> 5188.48
i'm gonna do this every day until you're

5188.08 --> 5191.679
all

5188.48 --> 5197.839999999999
dead from your own [ __ ] retardation

5191.679 --> 5197.84
how about that [ __ ]

5201.92 --> 5205.76
yeah you got a life that's why you're

5203.44 --> 5210.799999999999
trolling my chat yeah that's what

5205.76 --> 5213.6
people with lives do

5210.8 --> 5214.08
they have all the time in the world to

5213.6 --> 5215.679
troll

5214.08 --> 5217.28
other people that's what people with

5215.679 --> 5220.719
lives do right uh

5217.28 --> 5223.199
oh no no they don't do that

5220.719 --> 5226.0
people that have lives don't have time

5223.199 --> 5228.48
for [ __ ] like that

5226.0 --> 5230.4
right they don't have frustrations that

5228.48 --> 5233.199
makes them need to project their

5230.4 --> 5236.48
retardation onto other people either

5233.199 --> 5237.919999999999
because they have a successful life

5236.48 --> 5240.08
where they are not left with

5237.92 --> 5243.679
frustrations because of their own

5240.08 --> 5246.48
personal utter failure in life

5243.679 --> 5247.4400000000005
yeah so you don't have a life you [ __ ]

5246.48 --> 5249.5199999999995
hard

5247.44 --> 5252.638999999999
you're here in my chat trying to troll

5249.52 --> 5255.120000000001
me you are a goddamn [ __ ]

5252.639 --> 5257.36
and you should [ __ ] take the freaking

5255.12 --> 5258.639
vaccine that's not a vaccine keep taking

5257.36 --> 5267.839999999999
it until you die

5258.639 --> 5267.84
[ __ ] keep doing it [ __ ]

5268.32 --> 5271.469999999999
[Music]

5277.28 --> 5280.4
all right andrew yeah you're not among

5279.6 --> 5284.400000000001
those

5280.4 --> 5284.4
it's just it's just these people

5286.88 --> 5292.84
it's like one or two guys

5290.159 --> 5294.799999999999
they they must be really feeling bad

5292.84 --> 5297.28
today you know

5294.8 --> 5298.08
because some days these people they

5297.28 --> 5300.159
can't

5298.08 --> 5302.0
really convince themselves of their own

5300.159 --> 5304.4
[ __ ] delusions

5302.0 --> 5306.56
so they just gotta make everybody else's

5304.4 --> 5309.04
life miserable so they don't have to

5306.56 --> 5310.96
feel how they don't have control over

5309.04 --> 5313.12
their own damn mind

5310.96 --> 5314.4800000000005
so they just try to project it you know

5313.12 --> 5317.76
the projection is an

5314.48 --> 5320.48
attempt to cast the misery

5317.76 --> 5322.88
the spell of their experience onto the

5320.48 --> 5326.32
other person

5322.88 --> 5327.28
make them the one they are the one that

5326.32 --> 5330.08
are

5327.28 --> 5330.4
having that not you and by doing that

5330.08 --> 5333.199
you

5330.4 --> 5334.96
focus on them and then you get the

5333.199 --> 5337.36
feeling like wait wait no

5334.96 --> 5338.4800000000005
they have the problem it's not me i'm

5337.36 --> 5341.839999999999
not having a problem

5338.48 --> 5342.638999999999
oh no no it's not me yeah that's what

5341.84 --> 5345.76
you're doing

5342.639 --> 5348.88
that's what these trolls are doing it's

5345.76 --> 5352.2390000000005
really pathetic and when they say

5348.88 --> 5354.56
i have a life they know they're lying

5352.239 --> 5357.599999999999
and they're not feeling happy about it i

5354.56 --> 5357.6
can assure you that

5360.159 --> 5365.5199999999995
right estelle in 80 12 thanks for being

5362.84 --> 5368.08
here

5365.52 --> 5369.76
i'm still gonna go continue the show

5368.08 --> 5373.199
though

5369.76 --> 5376.56
i'm not out of here just yet so

5373.199 --> 5379.839999999999
but yeah it was interesting doing that

5376.56 --> 5379.84
i really don't care

5381.12 --> 5385.04
i mean for me it can be some of a relief

5383.92 --> 5388.56
to just

5385.04 --> 5388.56
really throw it out to them

5389.76 --> 5392.96
right because i will never like these

5392.239 --> 5395.839999999999
people i

5392.96 --> 5397.36
i hate people that are like that that's

5395.84 --> 5399.84
never going to change i will

5397.36 --> 5402.4
never accept them i will never tell them

5399.84 --> 5402.400000000001
it's okay

5402.88 --> 5406.0
because of the behavior right if you

5405.6 --> 5409.04
believe

5406.0 --> 5413.12
in a ball and you behave

5409.04 --> 5416.48
like a gentleman or gentle woman

5413.12 --> 5419.599999999999
then yeah you're okay by book

5416.48 --> 5422.32
because i was like that too

5419.6 --> 5423.04
20 years ago i really believed in the

5422.32 --> 5424.96
ball

5423.04 --> 5427.04
and it was hurting to me if somebody

5424.96 --> 5429.28
doubted it

5427.04 --> 5430.56
but i would still behave like a

5429.28 --> 5434.08
gentleman i wouldn't

5430.56 --> 5438.56
use it as an excuse to start behaving

5434.08 --> 5441.679
like a complete disgusting evil demon

5438.56 --> 5443.84
like a literal demon right because when

5441.679 --> 5446.4800000000005
you do that

5443.84 --> 5447.1990000000005
that frequency starts pulling you in and

5446.48 --> 5451.36
guess what

5447.199 --> 5454.4
some at some point you can't pull out

5451.36 --> 5458.0
anymore when you keep doing that

5454.4 --> 5459.44
you can't pull out of that mindset out

5458.0 --> 5462.639
of that troll mode

5459.44 --> 5464.239
out of that nasty at some point when you

5462.639 --> 5466.400000000001
keep doing it and doing it

5464.239 --> 5467.759999999999
you can't get out anymore and i knew

5466.4 --> 5471.44
that that's why i

5467.76 --> 5475.52
never did that because i i have

5471.44 --> 5476.96
purity right you can have purity and

5475.52 --> 5478.080000000001
even believe in the ball yeah you're

5476.96 --> 5480.159
going to make a lot of mistakes you're

5478.08 --> 5483.44
going to look like an idiot

5480.159 --> 5485.92
but as long as you're a good person

5483.44 --> 5486.719
as i said earlier like way earlier way

5485.92 --> 5489.36
back

5486.719 --> 5490.08
and it's kind of metaphorically perhaps

5489.36 --> 5494.159
literal in

5490.08 --> 5497.04
some way even ballers can go to heaven

5494.159 --> 5498.0
right because it's not about what you

5497.04 --> 5499.92
believe

5498.0 --> 5502.08
the place you're standing on to be it's

5499.92 --> 5504.08
about how you are in life

5502.08 --> 5506.08
how you compose yourself how you face

5504.08 --> 5509.199
your challenges how you deal with things

5506.08 --> 5511.12
in other people that's the more

5509.199 --> 5514.239
important thing

5511.12 --> 5516.4
and that's why i've championed a dual

5514.239 --> 5518.4
cosmogonical society even

5516.4 --> 5520.5599999999995
but it seems there's just people out

5518.4 --> 5524.96
there that can never

5520.56 --> 5527.76
accept that it that in reality physical

5524.96 --> 5531.52
reality it may not be a ball

5527.76 --> 5532.2390000000005
and they will go demonic they will let

5531.52 --> 5535.639
themselves

5532.239 --> 5540.638999999999
roll down and become the most despicable

5535.639 --> 5543.52
disgusting people you can imagine

5540.639 --> 5545.36
like if that happens in the physical

5543.52 --> 5546.8
world people will have a tendency of

5545.36 --> 5548.48
like literally just

5546.8 --> 5551.04
killing them to put them out of their

5548.48 --> 5554.48
misery it's that bad

5551.04 --> 5558.0
right and i've seen people actually

5554.48 --> 5559.28
physically in physical situations behave

5558.0 --> 5561.76
like that too and it is

5559.28 --> 5562.96
just like really you gotta walk away

5561.76 --> 5566.159000000001
quick or you just

5562.96 --> 5568.8
gonna strangle them it's so

5566.159 --> 5571.12
disgusting what people allow themselves

5568.8 --> 5571.12
to do

5573.04 --> 5580.96
right over their cultish fanaticism

5577.679 --> 5584.08
over their inability to let go

5580.96 --> 5587.679
of their of their convictions handed

5584.08 --> 5589.84
over to them by people and they believed

5587.679 --> 5593.1990000000005
it and then they're holding on to it

5589.84 --> 5596.4800000000005
forever that's the cultish conviction

5593.199 --> 5597.04
and that is what seduces them to engage

5596.48 --> 5600.32
in

5597.04 --> 5602.239
extreme offense demonic offense and then

5600.32 --> 5602.639
as they do it and they do it more and

5602.239 --> 5605.839999999999
more

5602.639 --> 5608.88
they become demonic and then they can't

5605.84 --> 5610.159000000001
step out of that again yeah that's what

5608.88 --> 5617.84
happens to these people

5610.159 --> 5617.839999999999
it's really sad

5621.199 --> 5625.12
but it's only really sad for them

5626.159 --> 5633.12
we shouldn't be sad i choose to

5629.52 --> 5636.159000000001
find it hilarious i choose to

5633.12 --> 5639.44
i choose to be amused

5636.159 --> 5642.48
by their stupidity and suffering

5639.44 --> 5643.12
because at least by their stupidity and

5642.48 --> 5645.599999999999
suffering

5643.12 --> 5646.4
being exposed like this invisible for

5645.6 --> 5648.400000000001
anybody

5646.4 --> 5650.48
even people that are not that invested

5648.4 --> 5653.839999999999
in the subject

5650.48 --> 5657.5199999999995
then at least their damage can serve

5653.84 --> 5658.88
as a display to discourage other people

5657.52 --> 5662.0
from doing that from

5658.88 --> 5663.4400000000005
letting themselves go there to slip into

5662.0 --> 5666.56
that

5663.44 --> 5668.638999999999
to avoid that at all costs throughout

5666.56 --> 5672.080000000001
your life starting very young

5668.639 --> 5675.12
because that [ __ ] starts up very young

5672.08 --> 5680.159
most people go trolling like

5675.12 --> 5680.159
between eight and twelve

5680.719 --> 5683.84
right and it's all fun and games at

5682.56 --> 5686.88
first

5683.84 --> 5687.360000000001
but when you take things personal and

5686.88 --> 5690.2390000000005
you

5687.36 --> 5693.119
dive in there and get real control

5690.239 --> 5696.08
freaky and evil and dark

5693.119 --> 5696.639
yeah it makes scars on your soul on your

5696.08 --> 5699.76
mind

5696.639 --> 5700.56
that you will never grow out of these

5699.76 --> 5703.6
scars will

5700.56 --> 5705.52
carry through your growth

5703.6 --> 5706.88
through your teen times through your

5705.52 --> 5710.320000000001
young adulthood

5706.88 --> 5712.32
and then you have that in you and you

5710.32 --> 5714.719
because of that have not been able to

5712.32 --> 5717.84
develop in other ways

5714.719 --> 5721.679
to be actually more likeable

5717.84 --> 5723.360000000001
this happens to people right and that's

5721.679 --> 5726.56
why i choose to

5723.36 --> 5728.5599999999995
let these trolls display themselves

5726.56 --> 5729.76
live on the spot with all their

5728.56 --> 5732.8
delusions

5729.76 --> 5735.119000000001
and be unfazed by it

5732.8 --> 5738.08
because it needs to be seen that this

5735.119 --> 5741.759999999999
happens to people

5738.08 --> 5745.5199999999995
and others need to see them as a warning

5741.76 --> 5745.84
don't do that not even for something

5745.52 --> 5748.8
that

5745.84 --> 5749.4400000000005
seems like a good reason never go full

5748.8 --> 5751.76
demon

5749.44 --> 5753.5199999999995
don't do it there is no legitimate

5751.76 --> 5756.4800000000005
reason to do that it's always

5753.52 --> 5758.639
just the seduction of the moment a quick

5756.48 --> 5763.678999999999
heavy relief

5758.639 --> 5763.679
but the price is too much just don't do

5768.84 --> 5772.56
it

5770.48 --> 5773.839999999999
i used to troll my babysitter aries when

5772.56 --> 5777.6
i say yeah but that's

5773.84 --> 5777.6
that's just your that's just

5778.0 --> 5782.84
your duty as a child and that's

5779.52 --> 5784.320000000001
different look if you still need a

5782.84 --> 5787.04
babysitter

5784.32 --> 5787.04
then yeah

5791.04 --> 5796.96
right but in that sense when you're

5794.48 --> 5800.5599999999995
trolling in that age category you're

5796.96 --> 5803.6
also doing it to kind of like

5800.56 --> 5806.88
reject the authority to separate right

5803.6 --> 5809.84
so that's actually a

5806.88 --> 5810.8
pulse that is not all evil that is not

5809.84 --> 5812.56
all petty

5810.8 --> 5814.400000000001
it's different it's very different when

5812.56 --> 5817.04
you do it very young

5814.4 --> 5817.759999999999
but still you can get seduced into

5817.04 --> 5821.199
taking things

5817.76 --> 5824.0
really personal and then going too far

5821.199 --> 5825.599999999999
seen it happen i've had it a couple of

5824.0 --> 5827.119
times

5825.6 --> 5828.719
by accident and i would be like

5827.119 --> 5832.639
afterwards like oh [ __ ]

5828.719 --> 5836.159
i did go too far that was just nasty

5832.639 --> 5838.159000000001
and i felt ashamed and then i

5836.159 --> 5839.28
ingrained it in my memory like don't do

5838.159 --> 5842.0
that again

5839.28 --> 5855.84
don't let it get that far it's

5842.0 --> 5855.84
meaningless it's only damaging

5857.28 --> 5864.0
yes yes nova maya right

5860.88 --> 5867.36
because i even explained exactly

5864.0 --> 5870.239
why i called it [ __ ]

5867.36 --> 5872.08
because it's literal it's not just like

5870.239 --> 5874.959999999999
you are

5872.08 --> 5877.04
a a category of people that are

5874.96 --> 5878.2390000000005
universally made fun of and i'll just

5877.04 --> 5881.44
leave it to that no i

5878.239 --> 5882.638999999999
actually use the word in a technical

5881.44 --> 5886.159
sense

5882.639 --> 5886.88
i explain it to you yeah so it's not

5886.159 --> 5890.36
just

5886.88 --> 5893.36
name calling no no it's an actual

5890.36 --> 5893.36
analysis

5900.719 --> 5911.84
how about that all right anyway

5904.08 --> 5911.84
i'll be back in two minutes

5911.86 --> 5915.009999999999
[Music]

6006.4 --> 6013.199
right let's

6009.679 --> 6013.1990000000005
get some fresh air in here

6015.36 --> 6018.639
just turn it down

6028.88 --> 6038.96
that was nice

6037.36 --> 6042.96
it's been a while since i had a good

6038.96 --> 6042.96
rant against a bunch of trolls

6043.92 --> 6051.84
it's really such a relief to just do it

6047.119 --> 6051.839999999999
like that

6060.99 --> 6064.2789999999995
[Music]

6073.6 --> 6079.84
yeah i know right george sanford

6087.84 --> 6091.029
[Music]

6095.42 --> 6099.069
[Music]

6104.84 --> 6107.84
dude

6110.08 --> 6121.84
doesn't ring a bell singing star wars

6111.92 --> 6121.84
sounds interesting

6134.32 --> 6150.719
i use weeds

6148.96 --> 6153.119
yeah that's right andrew by the way when

6150.719 --> 6157.199
the troll inevitably loses the truth

6153.119 --> 6160.88
sinks into their mind not always takes

6157.199 --> 6163.5199999999995
takes time well you know you got to them

6160.88 --> 6164.08
when they're just triggered and they

6163.52 --> 6166.159000000001
only

6164.08 --> 6167.84
are triggered right because that only

6166.159 --> 6171.44
trigger tension

6167.84 --> 6174.84
that's literally like a wall they summon

6171.44 --> 6176.48
in that moment in between their

6174.84 --> 6179.76
conscious

6176.48 --> 6182.239
and the information and is is

6179.76 --> 6184.08
reaching a crescendo and about to hit

6182.239 --> 6186.32
their consciousness right and they

6184.08 --> 6187.679
it starts to shine really bright onto

6186.32 --> 6191.44
them it starts hurting

6187.679 --> 6195.52
so they then erect this virtual wall

6191.44 --> 6198.96
of pure offense of pure trigger

6195.52 --> 6201.280000000001
that's when you know you got to them

6198.96 --> 6202.96
now if you let them if you start

6201.28 --> 6205.04
responding to that

6202.96 --> 6206.88
and then like poking and starting like a

6205.04 --> 6209.04
virtual fight

6206.88 --> 6211.28
then you'll actually make them lose that

6209.04 --> 6215.36
realization but if you let them just

6211.28 --> 6218.5599999999995
sputter it out then eventually

6215.36 --> 6219.759999999999
they might still have some glimpse of

6218.56 --> 6222.96
the original

6219.76 --> 6225.280000000001
light coming through

6222.96 --> 6225.28
right

6227.199 --> 6232.719
so that's why when a troll is is like

6230.639 --> 6235.04
properly triggered in a moment when you

6232.719 --> 6236.719
know you got to them not

6235.04 --> 6238.8
personal reasons but because of

6236.719 --> 6240.56
realization that you really made them

6238.8 --> 6242.08
realize and it hurts

6240.56 --> 6244.159000000001
that's when you have to stop kicking

6242.08 --> 6247.28
them kind of

6244.159 --> 6248.4
just let them sputter it out let them

6247.28 --> 6250.719
squirt

6248.4 --> 6252.239
let them be triggered don't kick them

6250.719 --> 6253.679
because if you kick them when they're

6252.239 --> 6255.919999999999
like that

6253.679 --> 6256.719
then you actually take away that light

6255.92 --> 6258.96
again then you

6256.719 --> 6259.76
really are giving them an excuse to

6258.96 --> 6262.8
deviate

6259.76 --> 6275.84
with their conscience and not

6262.8 --> 6275.84
let it sink in that's my advice on that

6286.84 --> 6289.84
ugh

6314.84 --> 6317.84
hmm

6326.719 --> 6332.8
hmm tree bark incense

6333.119 --> 6336.799999999999
right can be very interesting

6342.84 --> 6345.84
uh

6350.48 --> 6354.159
there's certain types of incense that i

6352.48 --> 6357.28
like so that like the

6354.159 --> 6360.32
the yellowish resin it's very standard

6357.28 --> 6360.32
what's it called again

6364.239 --> 6370.839999999999
i forget but i really like that type

6367.6 --> 6373.84
it's been a while since i've burnt some

6370.84 --> 6373.84
incense

6377.04 --> 6380.239
but it's also yeah i'm sharing this

6378.96 --> 6382.32
house with others if

6380.239 --> 6387.839999999999
when you burn incense it's gonna get

6382.32 --> 6387.84
everywhere so

6401.199 --> 6405.839999999999
infected sap tree what

6405.92 --> 6411.6
so it is like fermented wood

6409.52 --> 6412.96
or something something like that so you

6411.6 --> 6415.84
can start water that's

6412.96 --> 6415.84
that's weird

6439.44 --> 6443.839999999999
right so i'm gonna round out the show

6441.119 --> 6443.839999999999
guys

6444.32 --> 6459.599999999999
that was interesting

6456.159 --> 6462.879999999999
oh okay

6459.6 --> 6462.88
so it's just the sap

6464.56 --> 6469.92
cheers huh okay okay

6468.0 --> 6472.239
all right sounds like a relatively rare

6469.92 --> 6474.96
commodity then

6472.239 --> 6476.879999999999
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

6474.96 --> 6478.88
i hope you liked this show

6476.88 --> 6481.1990000000005
was a bit over the place at least there

6478.88 --> 6485.1990000000005
was a lot of activity

6481.199 --> 6488.48
i had to try to get through to a certain

6485.199 --> 6490.638999999999
group of trolls that just couldn't let

6488.48 --> 6494.08
it go today

6490.639 --> 6497.1990000000005
and yeah i hope that amused you

6494.08 --> 6499.5199999999995
uh yeah if you're just watching this as

6497.199 --> 6501.839999999999
an outsider don't take that personal

6499.52 --> 6503.280000000001
like even if you like that wasn't

6501.84 --> 6506.0
addressed to you

6503.28 --> 6507.44
even if you are like no but the earth

6506.0 --> 6510.239
can be a ball right

6507.44 --> 6513.36
right then i wasn't interested you it's

6510.239 --> 6516.638999999999
just that these type of people

6513.36 --> 6518.639
that are obsessed with trying to smear

6516.639 --> 6520.8
flat earthers and

6518.639 --> 6522.56
like they can't even consider that the

6520.8 --> 6525.28
earth might not be a ball

6522.56 --> 6526.719
right well if you can't consider that

6525.28 --> 6528.5599999999995
then you have a problem

6526.719 --> 6529.76
and then you will end up trolling like

6528.56 --> 6531.76
this

6529.76 --> 6533.6
very likely and then i will respond to

6531.76 --> 6536.08
you like i have

6533.6 --> 6536.639
but if you are still open-minded enough

6536.08 --> 6540.32
to just

6536.639 --> 6542.96
consider other things then i would never

6540.32 --> 6544.719
address you like that i wouldn't have to

6542.96 --> 6545.92

6544.719 --> 6549.679
