that'll be much appreciated

79.68 --> 87.28
right echo echo you say

84.24 --> 90.32
there's an echo

87.28 --> 91.68
yeah no surprise there probably has to

90.32 --> 95.119
do with the audio

91.68 --> 98.56
input capture i'll just

95.119 --> 101.84
mute it and

98.56 --> 101.84
hopefully there's no more echo

102.24 --> 109.36
right so hello adam meekin first in chat

105.92 --> 113.119
george sanford brandm

109.36 --> 116.399
yeah there's major issues this is a

113.119 --> 119.52
very flimsily quickly put together

116.399 --> 124.0
thing that i've tried to do

119.52 --> 129.119
because yeah yesterday i wasn't there

124.0 --> 132.08
and because when i started up my obs

129.119 --> 133.36
the entire scene collection archive that

132.08 --> 135.36
i had everything

133.36 --> 137.20000000000002
all the different types of setups it was

135.36 --> 140.56
all just completely

137.2 --> 142.72
erased completely erased and i have no

140.56 --> 144.8
idea how that's even possible i tried to

142.72 --> 147.84
reinstall thought it was maybe like a

144.8 --> 150.8
data interpretation issue

147.84 --> 152.4
but even after reinstalling it's just

150.8 --> 155.59900000000002
it's gone when i click

152.4 --> 158.31900000000002
the early bird show the old

155.599 --> 159.2
thing it's just nothing literally a

158.319 --> 163.35999999999999
blank screen

159.2 --> 166.48
nothing so to completely reconstruct

163.36 --> 168.4
a sort of functional show setup on a

166.48 --> 171.28
whim

168.4 --> 171.84
with my genius technical skills yeah i'm

171.28 --> 174.64000000000001
not

171.84 --> 175.68
not great at it and it's been a very

174.64 --> 179.83999999999997
long time since i

175.68 --> 181.92000000000002
even tweaked anything with obs so

179.84 --> 183.44
i had to quickly put something together

181.92 --> 187.76
and this is it so this

183.44 --> 192.07999999999998
sort of resembles the old

187.76 --> 194.959
show format a lot

192.08 --> 196.08
uh even though yeah all the picture data

194.959 --> 198.08
and the animation

196.08 --> 199.92000000000002
it's still on my computer i still have

198.08 --> 202.31900000000002
it it's just that the

199.92 --> 204.64
the framework of obs to put it all

202.319 --> 206.95899999999997
together has been completely wiped

204.64 --> 210.879
so i have to start all over again and

206.959 --> 210.879
try to reconstruct it and adam

211.04 --> 216.319
who is in chat he helped me the last

214.0 --> 219.44
time putting it together so hopefully

216.319 --> 223.04
together we can use

219.44 --> 226.4
some of today to yeah reconstruct it

223.04 --> 231.68
as close as possible to the old

226.4 --> 233.92000000000002
style and who knows maybe even afterward

231.68 --> 235.439
figure out a couple of upgrades because

233.92 --> 240.39999999999998
adam has collected a

235.439 --> 243.35999999999999
very few very interesting backdrops

240.4 --> 245.36
like really nice backgrounds that are

243.36 --> 249.59900000000002
pretty impressive and i might

245.36 --> 250.31900000000002
i might use them as a regular backdrop

249.599 --> 253.2
of

250.319 --> 254.0
the show so it's not just walking

253.2 --> 257.199
through the forest

254.0 --> 259.68
non-stop right

257.199 --> 259.68
anyway

260.72 --> 265.6
i got green tea with me it's a really

262.96 --> 268.32
beautiful day

265.6 --> 271.12
i haven't gotten to it yet but yeah it's

268.32 --> 274.24
still the early word show so

271.12 --> 277.68
look it's amazing

274.24 --> 283.28000000000003
sunny bright warm

277.68 --> 285.759
that's why i'm in my t-shirt

283.28 --> 287.52
although there has been well there is

285.759 --> 290.24
trails up there

287.52 --> 292.24
you can still see the distinct shapes

290.24 --> 294.56
have been many planes leaving trails

292.24 --> 297.28000000000003
don't know what kind of trails

294.56 --> 300.4
it does stand out that there seemed to

297.28 --> 303.919
just be more planes leaving trails

300.4 --> 308.56
in the last last day

303.919 --> 311.52
since yesterday too and there's the moon

308.56 --> 313.44
i don't know if the webcam picks it up

311.52 --> 314.0
but it's really nice and warm and

313.44 --> 316.56
there's just

314.0 --> 318.72
a lot of people outside doing all kinds

316.56 --> 320.8
of things

318.72 --> 322.96000000000004
[Music]

320.8 --> 325.52000000000004
and it's weird there's a bit of romance

322.96 --> 327.59999999999997
hanging in the air too and it's

325.52 --> 328.79999999999995
getting to me that that part is getting

327.6 --> 331.03900000000004
to me

328.8 --> 331.039
so

336.84 --> 339.84
yes

340.56 --> 347.68
hey amanda young long time no see

343.84 --> 347.67999999999995
or was it nah

349.68 --> 358.24
anyway good to see you so

354.8 --> 361.12
for now this show format

358.24 --> 361.12
will have to do

361.68 --> 368.0
and hopefully tomorrow

365.28 --> 369.84
or maybe other if it if we can't fix it

368.0 --> 372.8
all

369.84 --> 374.56
this afternoon then maybe we can do that

372.8 --> 378.479
tomorrow

374.56 --> 382.479
right so yeah but my day

378.479 --> 385.84
yesterday was pretty chaotic

382.479 --> 387.039
and kind of stressful because yeah i

385.84 --> 390.88
didn't do a show and

387.039 --> 392.0
i i kind of wanted to i had a lot in my

390.88 --> 394.319
mind that i was

392.0 --> 395.039
like i have finally had something to

394.319 --> 396.639
give

395.039 --> 399.59999999999997
and then it didn't work then was all

396.639 --> 403.52
gone so it was really frustrating

399.6 --> 403.52000000000004
and then later the evening i got some

404.319 --> 408.56
some more stress piled on when i got a

406.84 --> 413.35999999999996
letter

408.56 --> 418.08
from my landlord's lawyer goody

413.36 --> 420.8
so yeah i forwarded that to my lawyer

418.08 --> 421.28
and hopefully that will resolve the

420.8 --> 423.28000000000003
issue

421.28 --> 425.67999999999995
just like last time it's not like

423.28 --> 427.919
something has dramatically changed since

425.68 --> 427.919
then

428.24 --> 431.599
but yeah it makes me very nervous

430.72 --> 434.8
because they are

431.599 --> 437.759
threatening me kind of like

434.8 --> 440.16
yeah peer pressuring me it's complicated

437.759 --> 442.96000000000004
lawyer blabbering

440.16 --> 444.24
trying to just get me to go away and i'm

442.96 --> 445.84
not going away

444.24 --> 447.599
there's nowhere to go for me i'm not

445.84 --> 448.15999999999997
just gonna go on the freaking street

447.599 --> 450.639
because

448.16 --> 451.91900000000004
i'm not perfectly convenient to the

450.639 --> 454.72
landlord even though i

451.919 --> 456.24
am he's just taking everything i do for

454.72 --> 458.47900000000004
granted

456.24 --> 458.479
right

462.08 --> 466.71999999999997
but yeah i'm a bit stressed

467.039 --> 478.86
but still still in a pretty good mood

472.16 --> 482.059
despite all that

478.86 --> 482.059
[Music]

484.56 --> 490.0
it's just that in general being

487.68 --> 492.40000000000003
threatened to get kicked out of my house

490.0 --> 494.08
where i'm living is kind of stressful

492.4 --> 497.52
for me in general

494.08 --> 499.84
just this visceral influence

497.52 --> 501.919
on my physical being that's really

499.84 --> 503.84
unpleasant so i did have a little bit of

501.919 --> 506.08
an uncomfortable

503.84 --> 507.67999999999995
time trying to sleep yesterday night and

506.08 --> 510.24
that typically happens so

507.68 --> 512.5600000000001
thanks again for that landlord thanks a

510.24 --> 512.5600000000001
lot

513.039 --> 518.7189999999999
that's that's what i get for literally

515.2 --> 518.719
doing my utmost best

518.959 --> 525.4399999999999
to be like the guy of the house and

522.0 --> 527.36
and like clean things up and

525.44 --> 528.48
ensuring that everybody keeps buying

527.36 --> 530.72
toilet paper

528.48 --> 530.72
and

531.76 --> 535.8389999999999
when somebody's not responding to

534.72 --> 538.32
somebody else like

535.839 --> 540.08
being noisy because yeah oh i'm noisy

538.32 --> 542.48
sometimes apparently right

540.08 --> 544.399
well i'm not the only one and then when

542.48 --> 547.519
they get complaints

544.399 --> 549.76
they don't respond so i i i think i even

547.519 --> 551.519
shared this on the show like i i had to

549.76 --> 552.16
come out of my room and actually tell

551.519 --> 554.8
them like

552.16 --> 556.56
could you please not play guitar in

554.8 --> 560.0799999999999
middle of the night

556.56 --> 562.399
right because i'm not a dick

560.08 --> 563.44
that instead would call the police or

562.399 --> 565.68
something

563.44 --> 565.6800000000001
right

566.56 --> 569.92
but yeah that's what you get

570.32 --> 579.9200000000001
try to be good guy you get [ __ ]

576.56 --> 581.92
but i'll survive

579.92 --> 585.4399999999999
ah by the way thank you amanda young for

581.92 --> 585.4399999999999
the 5 super chat donation

587.12 --> 593.44
and hello agm

590.64 --> 596.56
yeah agm has been unbanned since the

593.44 --> 596.5600000000001
great unbanning

596.959 --> 600.959
where i figured out that with one click

599.04 --> 604.24
i could basically delete

600.959 --> 607.279
every every

604.24 --> 609.2
uh chat ban

607.279 --> 610.8
i ever did so there's thousands and

609.2 --> 613.6800000000001
thousands with one click i thought

610.8 --> 614.4799999999999
yeah let's just do that most of them are

613.68 --> 619.8389999999999
socks that are

614.48 --> 619.839
completely forgotten anyway

620.0 --> 627.76
and agm has been pretty

623.6 --> 627.76
pretty decently behaved recently so

631.2 --> 634.399
it's kind of good to have a mag

642.56 --> 649.1199999999999
am i the only ones who can't hear

646.079 --> 649.12
well i think so

650.0 --> 654.56
but my sound is not perfect i'm aware of

653.2 --> 657.36
this

654.56 --> 659.279
i tried to fix it that's also why i

657.36 --> 661.519
started up a little late i tried to fix

659.279 --> 663.36
it with the help of adam but it just

661.519 --> 666.079
didn't work out

663.36 --> 668.8000000000001
that i don't know how to alter the obs

666.079 --> 671.1999999999999
sound now because before

668.8 --> 671.92
when i went to advanced options and all

671.2 --> 675.0400000000001
that

671.92 --> 677.1999999999999
there was like oh a a slider

675.04 --> 678.48
where you could actually say oh more to

677.2 --> 679.36
the left more to the right yeah that

678.48 --> 682.8000000000001
slider is still

679.36 --> 683.36
looking at me but now for some insane

682.8 --> 686.399
reason

683.36 --> 688.48
you can't alter it you can't do anything

686.399 --> 691.68
with it so i cannot

688.48 --> 694.88
actively use it anymore it's it's

691.68 --> 697.5999999999999
garbage obs just turned it to

694.88 --> 698.079
garbage for no goddamn reason and i'm

697.6 --> 702.72
really

698.079 --> 705.8389999999999
pissed off at it really

702.72 --> 705.839
let's just ruin it

712.48 --> 717.839
yeah sorry for swearing

719.12 --> 724.32
sound is five times five i don't know

721.12 --> 724.32
what that means agm

727.04 --> 733.12
but i suspect that from what i can see

730.32 --> 734.72
in the mixer of obs that the sound

733.12 --> 736.32
coming through is going to be highly

734.72 --> 738.5600000000001
asymmetrical

736.32 --> 740.399
so if you got me on a speaker you

738.56 --> 742.079
probably won't notice too much if you

740.399 --> 744.16
got me on headphones you're probably

742.079 --> 745.4399999999999
going to hear it on one side very strong

744.16 --> 747.6
and barely on the other

745.44 --> 749.6800000000001
because that's what it looks like on the

747.6 --> 759.839
slider here

749.68 --> 759.8389999999999
on the equalizer so

760.0 --> 763.36
sorry it's so yeah i'm gonna try to fix

762.399 --> 765.68
it for now

763.36 --> 768.88
this is the way it's gonna be there's

765.68 --> 768.88
nothing i can do about it

769.279 --> 772.88
and at least i can just say hello again

772.16 --> 775.04
i'm still

772.88 --> 778.16
trying to do my shows just the heavy

775.04 --> 778.16
technical difficulties

779.44 --> 786.1600000000001
fortunately though i also figured out

782.88 --> 790.48
an interesting thing that i can actually

786.16 --> 793.12
export the

790.48 --> 794.5600000000001
the formats like the the scene

793.12 --> 798.32
collection as they're called in

794.56 --> 801.5189999999999
obs like what basically puts together

798.32 --> 805.12
the show and and the chat and the and

801.519 --> 805.12
the background and everything

805.36 --> 809.04
and i can export that file save it down

808.0 --> 811.68
so even if

809.04 --> 812.16
obs goes like oh it's all deleted again

811.68 --> 815.12
which

812.16 --> 816.8
just happened this morning again by the

815.12 --> 819.12
way

816.8 --> 819.92
because i had put together something

819.12 --> 821.6
which

819.92 --> 823.519
resembles very much what you're looking

821.6 --> 825.839
at right now

823.519 --> 827.44
and then i started obs and it was all

825.839 --> 829.519
gone just like that

827.44 --> 830.72
just like didn't exist anymore i had to

829.519 --> 834.24
start all over and

830.72 --> 834.24
rebuild it this morning

835.12 --> 839.12
so i don't know what the hell is going

837.68 --> 843.5999999999999
on with obs

839.12 --> 847.36
but it's totally screwing

843.6 --> 847.36
screwing the program

847.76 --> 857.8389999999999
and my work do not appreciate that

851.279 --> 857.8389999999999
hey hello dank

865.6 --> 872.24
right yeah there was

868.639 --> 874.16
no live show whatsoever yesterday

872.24 --> 876.16
because i wasn't there live

874.16 --> 877.92
there was no live ball busters i did

876.16 --> 880.639
know however notice

877.92 --> 883.12
that nathan just completely filled the

880.639 --> 886.8
entire day with premiere

883.12 --> 890.079
he had like four or five just kept on

886.8 --> 890.079
going and going and going

890.48 --> 895.76
and they were good shows i think there

892.399 --> 900.24
were some shows being repeated

895.76 --> 900.24
the same shows but they were still good

905.519 --> 912.16
what do i think of nasa pushing the new

910.16 --> 913.6
mars rover nonsense well yeah it's the

912.16 --> 915.36
same kind of as the old

913.6 --> 918.16
mars rover nonsense you know it's not

915.36 --> 918.16
the first time

919.279 --> 923.36
so yeah of course they're going to be oh

921.04 --> 924.0
it's so special look at the magic trick

923.36 --> 926.48
oh

924.0 --> 929.12
it's so real yeah of course they're

926.48 --> 929.12
gonna do that

931.759 --> 937.1990000000001
but it's it's stupid did anybody see

935.199 --> 940.24
david weiss

937.199 --> 943.04
why is this video he had a video

940.24 --> 943.04
that i watched

943.6 --> 949.279
what's his name again don pettit

949.92 --> 954.0
that was absolutely ridiculous that

952.839 --> 957.44
video

954.0 --> 959.68
but that guy is just ridiculous it's his

957.44 --> 959.6800000000001
thing

967.279 --> 971.92
but yeah the marsh rover is a lot in

969.519 --> 983.839
attention right now but

971.92 --> 983.8389999999999
also plenty of people making fun of it

992.24 --> 997.839
they called the rover perseverance sure

995.44 --> 997.839
they did

1004.61 --> 1007.82
[Music]

1022.839 --> 1028.079
um

1024.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
uh hello steve oh foster i

1028.079 --> 1039.839
don't know what you're talking about

1042.609 --> 1045.789
[Music]

1046.319 --> 1050.72
is this about curvature calculator

1050.84 --> 1053.84
claims

1055.44 --> 1059.559
look like for me the curvature

1057.44 --> 1064.24
calculator is kind of like

1059.559 --> 1064.24
2018 it's old

1064.4 --> 1067.44
it's already been revealed for the

1066.0 --> 1070.64
machination it is and

1067.44 --> 1074.64
most trenchers don't even reference

1070.64 --> 1077.919
it anymore unless they are in a

1074.64 --> 1080.16
like in a mind wipe they're like just

1077.919 --> 1082.16
re-inserting all everything over again

1080.16 --> 1084.16
like boats going over curve and all that

1082.16 --> 1085.679
when they're like in complete ignorant

1084.16 --> 1088.48
restart mode

1085.679 --> 1090.16
restart the ball stories again then they

1088.48 --> 1093.1200000000001
might bring it up

1090.16 --> 1094.0800000000002
but overall the ones on on the front

1093.12 --> 1095.6789999999999
line that

1094.08 --> 1097.52
that really try to approach flat

1095.679 --> 1100.0
earthers they don't even bring up the

1097.52 --> 1106.16
curvature calculator anymore

1100.0 --> 1106.16
so curve calculators are totally wrong

1106.84 --> 1112.08
okay sure they're wrong

1109.52 --> 1112.799
you know why they're wrong though

1112.08 --> 1117.9189999999999
because they

1112.799 --> 1117.9189999999999
exclude perspective and they replace it

1118.88 --> 1125.2
so they negate any yeah perspective

1122.16 --> 1126.0800000000002
apparent size changes within the

1125.2 --> 1130.64
calculation

1126.08 --> 1134.48
and then instead the reduction in size

1130.64 --> 1138.7990000000002
is accepted

1134.48 --> 1140.64
as a a height change like a literal

1138.799 --> 1143.84
height change due to

1140.64 --> 1145.919
a curve that's the idea behind it

1143.84 --> 1148.559
that's the process the replacement

1145.919 --> 1150.0800000000002
process of perspective that it applies

1148.559 --> 1151.9189999999999
but it's completely wrong because we

1150.08 --> 1154.08
don't see an autographic view

1151.919 --> 1154.96
we we see with perspective so it

1154.08 --> 1157.6
replaces

1154.96 --> 1157.6000000000001
perspective

1158.32 --> 1162.0
with an autographic view that excludes

1160.799 --> 1165.84
perspective

1162.0 --> 1168.08
and then says that the drop is due to

1165.84 --> 1170.559
instead of distance and then reducing

1168.08 --> 1173.039
the apparent size due to that distance

1170.559 --> 1174.8799999999999
they say the drop is due to earth curve

1173.039 --> 1178.799
so that is how the machination of the

1174.88 --> 1180.64
curvature calculator works we

1178.799 --> 1182.6399999999999
uncovered this over at the flat earth

1180.64 --> 1185.8400000000001
debates

1182.64 --> 1185.8400000000001
in 2018

1187.039 --> 1193.2
like even mick west came on

1190.48 --> 1193.84
and basically admitted things like it

1193.2 --> 1197.679
assumes

1193.84 --> 1207.84
r within the calculator

1197.679 --> 1207.8400000000001
and all that

1215.28 --> 1220.72
what are you talking about cousin omar

1217.6 --> 1223.1999999999998
i'm pretty sure the ball

1220.72 --> 1223.919
even if it was a ball let's presuppose

1223.2 --> 1225.8400000000001
it

1223.919 --> 1228.88
it's pretty much stationary there's

1225.84 --> 1228.8799999999999
nothing speeding up

1230.96 --> 1243.46
because there's no coriolis effect

1235.77 --> 1243.46
[Music]

1251.12 --> 1256.559
calculators are real if it was a globe

1254.559 --> 1259.6
but we see it totally diff

1256.559 --> 1263.84
now now even again that's the weird

1259.6 --> 1263.84
thing even if the calculators

1264.32 --> 1267.76
even if the earth was a globe then the

1266.799 --> 1272.1589999999999
calculator

1267.76 --> 1272.1589999999999
for earth curvature would still be wrong

1272.48 --> 1277.6
because it still excludes perspective

1275.2 --> 1281.039
and in reality there is perspective now

1277.6 --> 1284.1589999999999
if we were living on the ball

1281.039 --> 1286.0
then there would be curve

1284.159 --> 1288.0800000000002
there would be something persistently

1286.0 --> 1291.12
blocking things in the distance

1288.08 --> 1294.559
because the curve is in the way and then

1291.12 --> 1297.76
on top of that perspective on top of it

1294.559 --> 1301.44
right so the curvature calculator

1297.76 --> 1304.96
currently used can never function

1301.44 --> 1307.039
it's it's built broken

1304.96 --> 1308.96
because it never includes perspective so

1307.039 --> 1312.4
it can never be used for anything

1308.96 --> 1319.8400000000001
visual even if the earth were a ball

1312.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
you see it's completely useless now

1330.64 --> 1334.48
being asked about the lines of latitude

1333.44 --> 1338.159
well

1334.48 --> 1338.159
it's not really a line it's a

1338.4 --> 1342.159
it's an arbitrary position

1342.72 --> 1346.08
based on celestial apparent position

1345.36 --> 1349.4399999999998
derivative

1346.08 --> 1361.84
or rather angular position

1349.44 --> 1361.8400000000001
derived lines so

1369.28 --> 1375.84
can powerful telescopes be used to

1372.0 --> 1379.2
overcome perspective no

1375.84 --> 1383.039
but powerful telescopes might

1379.2 --> 1386.8400000000001
allow to see further

1383.039 --> 1388.72
due to the incredible level of angular

1386.84 --> 1390.559
resolution

1388.72 --> 1392.559
right because the angular resolution

1390.559 --> 1395.52
limit is eventually the thing

1392.559 --> 1397.44
that effectively makes the site fall

1395.52 --> 1399.9189999999999
into the horizon

1397.44 --> 1400.96
now if your angular resolution limit is

1399.919 --> 1405.2
unbelievable

1400.96 --> 1408.4
then that last part that last folding

1405.2 --> 1410.96
you will actually see much more

1408.4 --> 1412.5590000000002
because of the angular resolution of a

1410.96 --> 1415.2
giant telescope

1412.559 --> 1416.3999999999999
right although it will still be

1415.2 --> 1420.48
influenced by

1416.4 --> 1421.76
the atmosphere by the air it's looking

1420.48 --> 1424.32
through so

1421.76 --> 1425.76
even if the angular resolution limit is

1424.32 --> 1428.0
extremely high

1425.76 --> 1430.64
then still eventually things will get

1428.0 --> 1433.6
blurred out from sight

1430.64 --> 1435.1200000000001
because of the air that is just going to

1433.6 --> 1436.8799999999999
diffuse

1435.12 --> 1439.039
everything and then at some point it's

1436.88 --> 1442.3200000000002
not going to be able to see further

1439.039 --> 1446.4
so i think that giant telescopes

1442.32 --> 1449.4399999999998
have a like the bigger telescope

1446.4 --> 1451.6000000000001
the further you can potentially see with

1449.44 --> 1451.6000000000001
it

1452.48 --> 1456.08
but there will always be a cap

1457.36 --> 1460.9599999999998
because of the area looking through

1467.12 --> 1469.36
right

1471.44 --> 1474.96
hello rufus and hubbins i look sharp

1474.0 --> 1477.279
today okay

1474.96 --> 1477.279
thanks

1481.6 --> 1487.84
what happened to the black shirt i took

1483.279 --> 1487.84
it off

1489.039 --> 1492.799
you know when i wear my sweater i do

1490.88 --> 1495.0390000000002
wear a black shirt on top of

1492.799 --> 1496.6399999999999
my white shirt because otherwise it

1495.039 --> 1499.679
shines through the black

1496.64 --> 1501.76
sweater a lot and that's weird

1499.679 --> 1504.0800000000002
but i've been wearing a white shirt all

1501.76 --> 1504.08
year

1506.0 --> 1510.64
i haven't seen you in a while let your

1508.0 --> 1510.64
uh no

1511.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
not today

1520.48 --> 1526.72
i've had my hair down a lot

1523.76 --> 1528.8799999999999
in the last few months so but i'm not

1526.72 --> 1543.84
doing that today

1528.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
my hair is just too chaotic

1557.44 --> 1562.3200000000002
i'd like to focus on conversation please

1563.01 --> 1566.24
[Music]

1566.4 --> 1573.2
guy argued horizon comes from greek

1569.679 --> 1573.2
word circle what

1578.72 --> 1585.84
i i don't know about that

1581.84 --> 1585.84
steven foster

1586.96 --> 1592.159
is bitcoin around what no bitcoin is

1590.4 --> 1595.6000000000001
digital

1592.159 --> 1599.8400000000001
this is silver

1595.6 --> 1599.84
it's not bitcoin

1629.279 --> 1633.279
you would like non-digital bitcoin well

1631.76 --> 1635.36
that's too bad for you because that

1633.279 --> 1638.48
doesn't exist

1635.36 --> 1640.8799999999999
now somebody could make something

1638.48 --> 1642.64
physical and then tell you it is a

1640.88 --> 1645.1200000000001
physical bitcoin and if you

1642.64 --> 1647.44
accept that then you might consider

1645.12 --> 1649.76
having a physical bitcoin

1647.44 --> 1650.64
but when it comes to the currency

1649.76 --> 1652.48
bitcoin

1650.64 --> 1654.3990000000001
that's never going to happen you could

1652.48 --> 1657.919
install bitcoin

1654.399 --> 1658.6399999999999
on a digital device and then say that

1657.919 --> 1661.679
the

1658.64 --> 1662.3990000000001
digital storage device is a bitcoin

1661.679 --> 1664.3990000000001
physical

1662.399 --> 1666.2399999999998
but then you would just be reifying the

1664.399 --> 1670.8799999999999
storage device into

1666.24 --> 1670.88
the bitcoin right so no

1675.2 --> 1684.88
no i did not read up about edgar says

1679.6 --> 1684.8799999999999
case casey sorry steamy traveler

1690.799 --> 1694.6399999999999
i was a bit weirded out about it

1694.96 --> 1699.2
and you brought that up because of just

1697.12 --> 1700.399
the things that are put together as what

1699.2 --> 1704.32
is has to his

1700.399 --> 1711.84
activities just like oh okay

1704.32 --> 1711.84
that sounds eerily familiar

1722.84 --> 1726.799
this

1724.96 --> 1739.76
so i don't know it made me a little

1726.799 --> 1742.0
nervous actually

1739.76 --> 1744.0
yeah and then all this stuff happened

1742.0 --> 1749.12
and i completely forgot about it

1744.0 --> 1752.32
right so i i yeah can safely say that

1749.12 --> 1754.2399999999998
i i have roughly forgotten a lot of

1752.32 --> 1756.559
details of everything that has happened

1754.24 --> 1761.2
in the last

1756.559 --> 1761.2
week because of what happened yesterday

1762.08 --> 1767.84
so you have to pretty much remind me

1764.0 --> 1767.84
about it or i'd have to watch it back

1782.48 --> 1794.08
a circle is flat in geometry yeah well

1785.76 --> 1796.96
yes if it's just a circle

1794.08 --> 1798.399
a circle is flat indeed it's also the

1796.96 --> 1801.44
funny part about

1798.399 --> 1804.08
mention of this circle of the earth

1801.44 --> 1804.0800000000002
in the bible

1804.799 --> 1808.08
but yeah that can mean a lot of things

1806.559 --> 1811.52
because of what type of circle

1808.08 --> 1822.559
are we talking about could perhaps a

1811.52 --> 1824.8799999999999
spatial loop also be considered a circle

1822.559 --> 1827.6789999999999
but yeah it's basically semantics at

1824.88 --> 1830.159
that point i was just wondering like

1827.679 --> 1832.3990000000001
technically speaking could a straight

1830.159 --> 1833.7600000000002
line looping in on itself be considered

1832.399 --> 1835.6789999999999
circular

1833.76 --> 1837.52
but geometrically that's probably

1835.679 --> 1839.8400000000001
incorrect now if you would take on some

1837.52 --> 1839.84
kind of

1840.72 --> 1846.96
fourth dimensional space then perhaps

1843.84 --> 1848.1589999999999
by einstein's definition a straight line

1846.96 --> 1851.6000000000001
looping in on itself

1848.159 --> 1854.3990000000001
is circular

1851.6 --> 1865.1999999999998
but yeah that that's not actually

1854.399 --> 1868.559
physically circular then

1865.2 --> 1871.279
it's just that when loops

1868.559 --> 1873.519
are described to make somebody

1871.279 --> 1876.24
understand it

1873.519 --> 1876.64
the circle is always referenced because

1876.24 --> 1879.279
your

1876.64 --> 1881.519
circuit it's like the best next steps

1879.279 --> 1883.039
like to imagine the circle looping in on

1881.519 --> 1885.76
itself with the circle it's not that

1883.039 --> 1888.24
hard to imagine that you're starting

1885.76 --> 1890.0
where you came from that you end up

1888.24 --> 1891.6
there

1890.0 --> 1893.919
it's just that if it's in a straight

1891.6 --> 1898.399
line then it gets a little weird so

1893.919 --> 1901.6000000000001
to explain a spatial loop

1898.399 --> 1903.039
in a straight line ending up up in the

1901.6 --> 1904.48
same place you started

1903.039 --> 1906.08
even though you're going in a straight

1904.48 --> 1909.279
line yeah

1906.08 --> 1912.72
when explaining that a circle is

1909.279 --> 1916.24
probably the first thing you're going to

1912.72 --> 1918.3990000000001
involve to try and explain the concept

1916.24 --> 1921.84
right even though it isn't technically

1918.399 --> 1921.84
geometrically a circle

1921.919 --> 1925.1200000000001
but yeah what are you gonna do

1925.88 --> 1929.1190000000001
[Music]

1929.679 --> 1935.8400000000001
you understand looping now that is

1931.6 --> 1938.799
awesome amanda you

1935.84 --> 1940.08
and technically it shouldn't have to be

1938.799 --> 1943.84
that difficult

1940.08 --> 1947.36
because even in games computer games

1943.84 --> 1950.6399999999999
like things like portals

1947.36 --> 1955.1999999999998
and even on tv series

1950.64 --> 1958.88
doctor who the tardis

1955.2 --> 1962.559
and then some certain scenes in certain

1958.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
movies matrix and even like star trek

1962.559 --> 1967.36
episodes

1963.84 --> 1969.76
have treated the concept for some reason

1967.36 --> 1971.76
as a concept so then you start to wonder

1969.76 --> 1974.32
did they just conjure it out of

1971.76 --> 1977.519
absolutely nothing or is it just the

1974.32 --> 1980.32
realization of something

1977.519 --> 1981.039
incredible about our reality that is

1980.32 --> 1984.08
just

1981.039 --> 1986.8799999999999
kind of too heavy to just overtly

1984.08 --> 1987.76
declare it right and it wouldn't be

1986.88 --> 1990.5590000000002
consistent

1987.76 --> 1991.36
with the heliocentric cosmology anyway

1990.559 --> 1994.6399999999999
so that would

1991.36 --> 1996.7199999999998
already make that impossible

1994.64 --> 1998.88
but i'm just wondering sometimes is it

1996.72 --> 2001.279
completely out of nowhere

1998.88 --> 2002.3200000000002
out of pure fantasy conjured concept

2001.279 --> 2005.12
that is physically

2002.32 --> 2005.84
eternally impossible or is it actually

2005.12 --> 2008.9599999999998
something that

2005.84 --> 2012.32
is and has always been present it's just

2008.96 --> 2015.1200000000001
really tough to realize

2012.32 --> 2017.2
what that is and that it can't be

2015.12 --> 2019.84
something else

2017.2 --> 2019.8400000000001
right

2020.399 --> 2025.12
looping to me is like pac-man no that's

2023.36 --> 2028.559
an example

2025.12 --> 2029.4399999999998
you know but the thing though with

2028.559 --> 2032.96
pac-man

2029.44 --> 2036.0800000000002
you know pac-man as a game

2032.96 --> 2037.679
the thing is is that it's centered

2036.08 --> 2040.08
around the level

2037.679 --> 2041.919
so your pac-man goes around on the level

2040.08 --> 2044.48
right and then he goes to one side

2041.919 --> 2047.039
and then he ends up at the other right

2044.48 --> 2049.359
that's a loop but that's still like an

2047.039 --> 2052.8
off-screen loop

2049.359 --> 2053.44
well if then you could program the game

2052.8 --> 2055.28
and it would

2053.44 --> 2056.8
probably not be very nice to play like

2055.28 --> 2060.7200000000003
that but to

2056.8 --> 2063.28
center onto pac-man himself

2060.72 --> 2065.4399999999996
then the screen instead would be moving

2063.28 --> 2066.8
around pac-man as pac-man stands still

2065.44 --> 2068.399
and then

2066.8 --> 2070.3990000000003
going to the side on the other side

2068.399 --> 2073.1189999999997
would simply go through the tight

2070.399 --> 2074.0789999999997
tunnel to the other side and end up in

2073.119 --> 2076.3990000000003
the same place

2074.079 --> 2078.3990000000003
now if you look at it like that then you

2076.399 --> 2078.96
can understand much better of what it

2078.399 --> 2082.159
would be

2078.96 --> 2082.7200000000003
like to be physically within a loop

2082.159 --> 2086.56
because

2082.72 --> 2089.7599999999998
every observation we make as people

2086.56 --> 2093.119
so consciousness is always from

2089.76 --> 2094.32
our perspective from our observation

2093.119 --> 2097.52
vantage point

2094.32 --> 2100.56
so that is what it would always be like

2097.52 --> 2101.28
to experience a loop you would never go

2100.56 --> 2104.24
to some

2101.28 --> 2106.7200000000003
edge and then teleport or whatever

2104.24 --> 2108.56
magical experience to another side no

2106.72 --> 2111.1189999999997
it would just seem like a standard

2108.56 --> 2111.119
connection

2113.839 --> 2121.839
right so yeah pac-man pac-man

2118.96 --> 2124.48
it's been called the pac-man model very

2121.839 --> 2126.16
annoying name to me by the way

2124.48 --> 2128.48
because it makes it just silly and it

2126.16 --> 2131.839
isn't silly it's not silly at all it's

2128.48 --> 2131.839
very serious in my opinion

2134.16 --> 2145.839
but fine pac-man is an example

2137.92 --> 2145.839
of a looping system

2148.0 --> 2151.52
can you cast spells in real life yeah

2150.88 --> 2155.76
it's called

2151.52 --> 2159.119
communication it's called words stories

2155.76 --> 2162.079
yeah spelling

2159.119 --> 2163.92
so yeah you can definitely cast spells

2162.079 --> 2167.6800000000003
in real life

2163.92 --> 2170.88
and the more conscious you become

2167.68 --> 2173.839
the more you will realize that words are

2170.88 --> 2173.839
spells

2175.2 --> 2178.56
and their impact can be

2179.52 --> 2186.72
dramatic if yeah if the

2183.28 --> 2188.4
the will and the train of thought and

2186.72 --> 2191.839
the dream supporting it

2188.4 --> 2194.88
is strong enough right

2191.839 --> 2198.24
so it comes into fruition

2194.88 --> 2199.04
through spells the dreams come into

2198.24 --> 2202.56
fruition

2199.04 --> 2205.92
through spells through words

2202.56 --> 2215.839
stories ideas visualizations all kinds

2205.92 --> 2215.839
of things

2225.28 --> 2233.119
now whether words have influence

2229.2 --> 2236.72
outside of the spirit and consciousness

2233.119 --> 2237.839
that is another matter i don't know

2236.72 --> 2239.4399999999996
about that

2237.839 --> 2242.0789999999997
i don't think so i don't think there is

2239.44 --> 2244.8
literally well there might be

2242.079 --> 2246.5600000000004
sound based techniques but that wouldn't

2244.8 --> 2248.32
literally be words

2246.56 --> 2250.0
you know i think that might have been

2248.32 --> 2252.1600000000003
even the original mistake

2250.0 --> 2254.48
about the idea of spell casting with

2252.16 --> 2256.64
words in the magical words

2254.48 --> 2259.28
well maybe it's not about the words but

2256.64 --> 2262.8799999999997
it's about the type of sound

2259.28 --> 2265.2000000000003
that that that those words have and that

2262.88 --> 2266.56
the specific type of sound frequencies

2265.2 --> 2270.16
and all that can

2266.56 --> 2272.93
have certain effects like for example

2270.16 --> 2275.68
sound to

2272.93 --> 2278.48
[Music]

2275.68 --> 2279.5989999999997
to make stone moldable certainly to make

2278.48 --> 2283.04
it soft

2279.599 --> 2285.599
or to make it very light all that

2283.04 --> 2286.8
well wouldn't be the words it's a sound

2285.599 --> 2290.48
effect

2286.8 --> 2293.92
now the person could train themselves to

2290.48 --> 2297.52
verbally produce those sounds

2293.92 --> 2299.76
using certain words training to say them

2297.52 --> 2300.96
in a certain way because those words

2299.76 --> 2304.6400000000003
produce the

2300.96 --> 2306.7200000000003
required type of sound effects

2304.64 --> 2307.7599999999998
perhaps classified under cymatics or

2306.72 --> 2311.2
something

2307.76 --> 2313.6800000000003
you know just sound effects

2311.2 --> 2315.52
that could have magical or would seem

2313.68 --> 2319.2799999999997
like magical influences

2315.52 --> 2322.56
right so

2319.28 --> 2322.5600000000004
yeah there you go

2323.599 --> 2328.96
i think there is sound effects sound

2326.64 --> 2329.68
magic you could say sound has an

2328.96 --> 2332.7200000000003
incredible

2329.68 --> 2334.24
potential in what it can actually do but

2332.72 --> 2337.52
it's not going to be the words

2334.24 --> 2340.4799999999996
the words are based on information and

2337.52 --> 2342.16
you can conjure ideas and dreams and all

2340.48 --> 2345.44
and motivations and

2342.16 --> 2347.44
trigger people with the meaning of words

2345.44 --> 2349.359
but the word themselves are only the

2347.44 --> 2352.48
communication device

2349.359 --> 2353.68
for the information which is purely in

2352.48 --> 2356.0
spirit it's

2353.68 --> 2357.68
it's an ethereal thing it's only within

2356.0 --> 2358.96
our consciousness that it actually has

2357.68 --> 2361.44
that meaning and does

2358.96 --> 2362.88
things because the sound itself doesn't

2361.44 --> 2366.0
do that

2362.88 --> 2369.2000000000003
but sound separately may have an

2366.0 --> 2372.96
influence that is pretty remarkable

2369.2 --> 2372.96
of material right

2381.28 --> 2385.3590000000004
i know ares 106.

2388.4 --> 2393.92
yeah with the sonic cannon and [ __ ] yeah

2391.52 --> 2396.72
it's interesting

2393.92 --> 2399.04
it's also funny if you realize that

2396.72 --> 2402.64
those sound cannons weren't even in

2399.04 --> 2402.64
the original dune book

2403.76 --> 2406.7200000000003
weirding modules

2409.44 --> 2425.839
like they were added on i think

2432.079 --> 2439.3590000000004
what the hell does that mean what does a

2435.599 --> 2442.2400000000002
fake martial arts adapt sound like i've

2439.359 --> 2442.24
never heard of that

2443.68 --> 2445.9199999999996
right

2447.359 --> 2454.72
and i've had my fair share in the past

2449.68 --> 2454.72
it's just that i kind of dropped it

2464.839 --> 2467.839
eventually

2470.319 --> 2476.8
search it out what really wha

2473.599 --> 2480.1600000000003
you want me to search for

2476.8 --> 2484.4
fake martial arts add that

2480.16 --> 2487.52
really really you want me to google that

2484.4 --> 2489.92
what no no no that

2487.52 --> 2492.319
why didn't you do that you let google

2489.92 --> 2495.6800000000003
know that you're [ __ ]

2492.319 --> 2497.839
that's fine then you can relay that

2495.68 --> 2509.839
information you gathered in the process

2497.839 --> 2509.839
to me i'm not gonna do that for you

2520.0 --> 2525.68
okay stone monkey 3d yeah i can imagine

2523.599 --> 2528.0
that it would be convenient but i don't

2525.68 --> 2530.56
think you you'll just have

2528.0 --> 2537.839
that sort of technique readily available

2530.56 --> 2537.839
without consequences at least

2546.88 --> 2555.76
oh there's a new dune

2551.52 --> 2557.68
i've seen something i've heard of it

2555.76 --> 2560.48
it's more faithful to the books okay

2557.68 --> 2561.839
that would be very interesting

2560.48 --> 2565.839
who knows maybe it is going to be a

2561.839 --> 2565.839
really good one

2566.319 --> 2571.52
i i'm just more curious whether they're

2568.64 --> 2573.52
gonna kill it with cgi

2571.52 --> 2575.7599999999998
you know if it's gonna be all that just

2573.52 --> 2578.24
action and cgi and [ __ ]

2575.76 --> 2580.3190000000004
or whether they're really gonna relay

2578.24 --> 2583.68
the culture

2580.319 --> 2586.56
without it all being a super special boy

2583.68 --> 2586.56
or something i don't know

2586.96 --> 2595.2
so we'll see but yeah doom

2590.24 --> 2595.2
is look very close to my heart

2596.0 --> 2600.48
like paul atreides i kind of associated

2599.68 --> 2604.319
with him

2600.48 --> 2604.319
in spirit many ways

2605.599 --> 2610.96
sometimes i think i feel

2608.96 --> 2612.079
that i sort of did something similar

2610.96 --> 2621.839
with my own life

2612.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
and that's why it's weird

2621.92 --> 2625.04
but yeah the awakening and all that

2624.16 --> 2628.48
that's had

2625.04 --> 2631.44
it heavily inspired me

2628.48 --> 2631.44
and the telepathy

2633.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
but also just how it all happened

2636.24 --> 2641.1189999999997
the position of weakness that he

2639.119 --> 2644.4
actually started out with

2641.119 --> 2646.6400000000003
that part also really

2644.4 --> 2648.0
inspired me because it's it makes it

2646.64 --> 2652.48
very real

2648.0 --> 2654.88
he's really being crushed from all sides

2652.48 --> 2654.88
and then

2655.52 --> 2661.04
finds the right vision and then

2658.72 --> 2663.4399999999996
yeah completely ascends out of it and

2661.04 --> 2668.079
it's just very inspiring

2663.44 --> 2668.079
that story to me

2673.599 --> 2678.48
and i especially thought that just the

2675.68 --> 2680.96
the occult secrets

2678.48 --> 2682.72
that system in the book was just really

2680.96 --> 2684.7200000000003
incredible

2682.72 --> 2690.64
just i really liked how they did that

2684.72 --> 2693.2
how they put that out

2690.64 --> 2705.839
and i thought it was properly translated

2693.2 --> 2705.839
in the original movie

2711.92 --> 2717.04
right so i think i'm about to round out

2716.24 --> 2719.2
the show

2717.04 --> 2722.4
but i could go on a little longer i did

2719.2 --> 2722.3999999999996
start out a little late

2722.96 --> 2733.2
so any remarks is this

2726.319 --> 2737.44
show format good enough

2733.2 --> 2740.48
hold on i think i should

2737.44 --> 2740.48
move that chat

2743.2 --> 2747.839
see what i can do

2749.04 --> 2761.839
get that thing out of there

2752.88 --> 2761.839
that might be better like this right

2774.079 --> 2777.52
get the text out of the way

2780.48 --> 2789.839
all right i shouldn't forget

2783.68 --> 2792.96
there's prioritizing let's see

2789.839 --> 2795.92
so if i just put the chat last

2792.96 --> 2796.96
right then it goes behind the background

2795.92 --> 2803.359
drawing

2796.96 --> 2806.4
yeah this is going nice

2803.359 --> 2806.4
center it a little more

2809.359 --> 2817.839
so there you go

2820.16 --> 2825.52
oh my god steamy traveler really

2823.28 --> 2827.599
greatest accomplishment in my life so

2825.52 --> 2830.16
far well

2827.599 --> 2832.88
well that's opening a can of worms one

2830.16 --> 2832.8799999999997
way or the other

2838.4 --> 2842.319
i could get really philosophical about

2840.48 --> 2844.2400000000002
to say that my greatest accomplished is

2842.319 --> 2847.44
also my greatest failure

2844.24 --> 2847.4399999999996
and vice versa

2853.28 --> 2857.0400000000004
sometimes i like to think that my

2857.599 --> 2865.2000000000003
sort of almost religious mission to

2862.0 --> 2869.04
keep me the way i am to be the person

2865.2 --> 2869.04
that i really am from the inside

2869.599 --> 2873.92
in this world where everybody's

2873.28 --> 2876.96
basically

2873.92 --> 2878.319
forced to relinquish those aspects and

2876.96 --> 2880.16
it's normalized

2878.319 --> 2881.44
i think that sometimes that is my

2880.16 --> 2885.44
greatest

2881.44 --> 2887.76
achievement although

2885.44 --> 2889.599
it yeah it's also my greatest curse

2887.76 --> 2892.3190000000004
anyway

2889.599 --> 2895.52
because then now i'm stuck a lot of the

2892.319 --> 2895.52
time because of it as well

2898.48 --> 2902.0
right with greatest accomplishment well

2900.16 --> 2905.1189999999997
it depends

2902.0 --> 2905.119
from what perspective

2911.44 --> 2914.96
i think in a way my greatest

2912.88 --> 2916.8
accomplishment could be considered that

2914.96 --> 2920.0
i

2916.8 --> 2920.88
that i at least finally really really

2920.0 --> 2923.04
snapped out of

2920.88 --> 2923.04
the

2924.0 --> 2930.72
like the globalism

2927.52 --> 2933.839
and not just the globe earth

2930.72 --> 2937.839
but that i i'm really happy

2933.839 --> 2941.92
that i truly and permanently snapped

2937.839 --> 2944.0
out of that liberalism because i was

2941.92 --> 2946.2400000000002
sort of mistakingly stuck in there

2944.0 --> 2947.92
from a delusion standpoint because i

2946.24 --> 2949.52
really thought that it was the right

2947.92 --> 2950.88
thing or that it's just like something

2949.52 --> 2953.2
you have to double down on

2950.88 --> 2955.2000000000003
until things turn all right right well

2953.2 --> 2959.04
it isn't

2955.2 --> 2961.68
oh my god it isn't right

2959.04 --> 2963.599
so that i think is a i'm very happy with

2961.68 --> 2966.5589999999997
that

2963.599 --> 2968.4
as to what the outside world would

2966.559 --> 2969.8390000000004
consider my greatest accomplishment

2968.4 --> 2971.44
i don't think the outside world

2969.839 --> 2974.7999999999997
considers anything i've done

2971.44 --> 2974.8
to be a great accomplishment

2978.88 --> 2984.48
but then again a lot of the times great

2982.24 --> 2987.359
accomplishments are in the i

2984.48 --> 2987.359
of the beholder

2994.0 --> 2998.16
in a way i think that a great no is it

2996.8 --> 3001.2000000000003
the greatest i'm

2998.16 --> 3003.2799999999997
a good accomplishment i think is

3001.2 --> 3005.2799999999997
still doing this show doing it

3003.28 --> 3009.2000000000003
persistently

3005.28 --> 3011.44
building up just show hosting

3009.2 --> 3012.319
and doing what i do and the psychology

3011.44 --> 3013.839
development

3012.319 --> 3016.5589999999997
because there has been a lot of

3013.839 --> 3016.5589999999997
development

3018.079 --> 3024.7200000000003
the problem is though that the things

3021.44 --> 3028.2400000000002
where i develop in the most i don't see

3024.72 --> 3029.68
that as something like oh i'm really so

3028.24 --> 3032.4799999999996
good at this

3029.68 --> 3034.3999999999996
because i'm used to it while things that

3032.48 --> 3036.48
i'm not good at and that i can't

3034.4 --> 3037.52
constantly stumble upon

3036.48 --> 3039.68
those are the things that are

3037.52 --> 3040.0
consciously emphasized to me because

3039.68 --> 3043.04
they

3040.0 --> 3044.96
are an obstacle they are in my way my

3043.04 --> 3047.359
ability to be really good at certain

3044.96 --> 3052.079
things is never in my way

3047.359 --> 3052.0789999999997
right so it's tough to judge

3052.319 --> 3058.96
myself like that it's good to see my obs

3056.559 --> 3062.079
is working well barely flat side my

3058.96 --> 3064.079
sound isn't working great

3062.079 --> 3065.8390000000004
and it still has these weird issues

3064.079 --> 3069.6800000000003
where it just

3065.839 --> 3073.359
suddenly discards

3069.68 --> 3073.359
the the setups of scenes

3074.24 --> 3078.24
so i have to keep on exporting

3079.68 --> 3083.839
the setup every time

3084.079 --> 3089.04
because yeah one time i might just start

3086.8 --> 3090.96
up my obs and then it's gone

3089.04 --> 3093.52
whatever i built whatever it is just

3090.96 --> 3097.839
it's just erased i don't know why

3093.52 --> 3097.839
but it does it

3110.16 --> 3116.16
yeah that's really cute mn

3113.359 --> 3119.2799999999997
yeah paranormal abilities yeah oh money

3116.16 --> 3124.24
money money yeah you know what

3119.28 --> 3127.44
you can't make money of that

3124.24 --> 3129.359
not without a bigger price

3127.44 --> 3130.96
if you're gonna commercialize on like

3129.359 --> 3136.319
spiritual abilities it's gonna

3130.96 --> 3138.7200000000003
[ __ ] you up it's a real risk

3136.319 --> 3140.0
it's a real serious risk and that's why

3138.72 --> 3141.68
i decided

3140.0 --> 3143.04
as soon as i figured out that i have

3141.68 --> 3147.839
certain abilities that i

3143.04 --> 3151.119
can't ever ever cash in on it

3147.839 --> 3156.0
never what i can do however is just

3151.119 --> 3158.88
apply it and then hopefully

3156.0 --> 3161.119
support everything that surround me and

3158.88 --> 3166.2400000000002
that they might support me

3161.119 --> 3168.8
in my need right that's the only way i

3166.24 --> 3171.04
i allow myself to really do that sort of

3168.8 --> 3171.04
thing

3172.319 --> 3176.0
like lay on hands and all that

3177.52 --> 3183.839
so it's like this i don't give a flying

3180.559 --> 3185.76
[ __ ] about money about oh

3183.839 --> 3187.7599999999998
look at all the giant prizes all you

3185.76 --> 3189.5200000000004
have to do is showcase yourself like

3187.76 --> 3192.559
some kind of

3189.52 --> 3195.68
public experiment

3192.559 --> 3199.52
beyond well just being a youtuber

3195.68 --> 3199.52
and being very honest about yourself

3199.599 --> 3204.2400000000002
but oh and we engaged to get money right

3202.0 --> 3207.359
i'll say that that means that i'm just

3204.24 --> 3210.7999999999997
a pub public play thing then to

3207.359 --> 3213.2799999999997
try and get the money right it's just

3210.8 --> 3213.28
brilliant

3216.16 --> 3221.04
no mn if you had telepathy or

3219.599 --> 3223.599
telekinesis

3221.04 --> 3225.2
you would curse the day you found out

3223.599 --> 3226.8
that you had it

3225.2 --> 3228.319
because the world's never gonna leave

3226.8 --> 3231.6800000000003
you alone

3228.319 --> 3233.7599999999998
that's why you know

3231.68 --> 3235.359
people that have these powers they keep

3233.76 --> 3238.4
them secret

3235.359 --> 3242.96
because everything is going to [ __ ]

3238.4 --> 3244.8
you up look at the freaking world how it

3242.96 --> 3246.64
is right now

3244.8 --> 3248.0
you think anybody is going to be

3246.64 --> 3251.839
anything other than

3248.0 --> 3251.839
suspicious or jealous

3253.28 --> 3255.599
right

3262.88 --> 3267.2000000000003
so yeah and then you just don't know

3265.44 --> 3267.839
what the [ __ ] you're talking about

3267.2 --> 3271.1189999999997
because you're

3267.839 --> 3274.319
a numpty and you can't look beyond just

3271.119 --> 3277.6800000000003
movie logic apparently or you would

3274.319 --> 3282.319
realize this sort of thing

3277.68 --> 3282.319
right and with movie logic i mean like

3282.72 --> 3286.9599999999996
marvel movie logic right because there

3285.599 --> 3290.0
are some actual

3286.96 --> 3292.96
interesting psionic

3290.0 --> 3293.52
serious movies out there that give it

3292.96 --> 3296.319
attention

3293.52 --> 3298.319
and that definitely emphasize like oh

3296.319 --> 3299.119
you have this power oh that's really

3298.319 --> 3302.64
cool

3299.119 --> 3305.119
except it's a nightmare yeah

3302.64 --> 3306.799
and that part i've expressed myself yeah

3305.119 --> 3309.04
being really empathetic be

3306.799 --> 3310.72
having that ability to basically crawl

3309.04 --> 3314.5589999999997
in somebody's head and

3310.72 --> 3317.4399999999996
get out really heavy details

3314.559 --> 3318.2400000000002
or heavy d not details as in information

3317.44 --> 3320.0
details but

3318.24 --> 3321.359
really getting the structure right away

3320.0 --> 3323.44
yeah it's a nightmare

3321.359 --> 3324.5589999999997
yeah i have this ability right it's

3323.44 --> 3328.7200000000003
really cool

3324.559 --> 3328.7200000000003
well having it is a nightmare

3329.28 --> 3335.8390000000004
because what i don't talk about is

3332.319 --> 3336.5589999999997
all the spiritual pain that also seeps

3335.839 --> 3338.96
through

3336.559 --> 3340.88
on a constant basis the pressure that

3338.96 --> 3349.839
builds up every time i do it

3340.88 --> 3349.839
yeah don't talk about that

3351.119 --> 3356.48
not in a direct sense anyway

3354.24 --> 3357.2799999999997
it's just that's gonna happen anyway

3356.48 --> 3360.319
that happened

3357.28 --> 3362.4
when i was young anyway so at some point

3360.319 --> 3363.2799999999997
you're just like okay well i have this

3362.4 --> 3366.799
ability

3363.28 --> 3369.8390000000004
i can just yeah i realize i'm [ __ ]

3366.799 --> 3370.72
the rest of my life how am i gonna get

3369.839 --> 3372.88
through this or

3370.72 --> 3374.8799999999997
just say okay well since i have this

3372.88 --> 3377.359
freaking curse anyway i might just try

3374.88 --> 3380.6400000000003
to learn to utilize it for something

3377.359 --> 3382.799
constructive and that's how i got it

3380.64 --> 3385.68
that's how it's gotten here that's why

3382.799 --> 3385.68
why i have this

3385.76 --> 3392.6400000000003
right it's a sheer necessity

3390.8 --> 3395.6800000000003
[Music]

3392.64 --> 3399.2
to divine people's thoughts

3395.68 --> 3402.24
has allowed me to survive

3399.2 --> 3404.0
extreme circumstances having that

3402.24 --> 3418.4799999999996
ability has literally allowed me

3404.0 --> 3433.839
to physically survive

3418.48 --> 3433.839
shut up any fun sir

3435.359 --> 3439.359
don't ability don't exist yeah yeah they

3437.839 --> 3443.04
do exist

3439.359 --> 3443.92
they do and you don't need a specific

3443.04 --> 3446.64
organ for it

3443.92 --> 3449.44
we have that specific organ you just

3446.64 --> 3454.0789999999997
need to learn how to deal

3449.44 --> 3457.359
with the tension that it brings

3454.079 --> 3460.559
without burning your nerves out

3457.359 --> 3462.64
right because if you just throw out

3460.559 --> 3466.0
that sort of [ __ ] if you have it you're

3462.64 --> 3466.0
gonna burn yourself up

3467.599 --> 3472.839
but that's something that you don't know

3469.2 --> 3475.839
about though because you don't think it

3472.839 --> 3475.839
exists

3496.96 --> 3501.599
comment section spamming bad links yeah

3500.079 --> 3504.559
i know

3501.599 --> 3505.2000000000003
i don't even get the the notifications

3504.559 --> 3507.599
anymore

3505.2 --> 3509.5989999999997
george sanford but if you want to like

3507.599 --> 3513.44
report

3509.599 --> 3515.119
the standardized advertisement comments

3513.44 --> 3517.44
in my comment section that would be

3515.119 --> 3519.92
great i do it with other people too

3517.44 --> 3522.2400000000002
like i do that everywhere everywhere i

3519.92 --> 3523.119
do even do it in the infowars comment

3522.24 --> 3525.04
section

3523.119 --> 3526.799
because they have that [ __ ] i just do it

3525.04 --> 3529.599
wherever i am it's just that you see

3526.799 --> 3530.319
stupid butt advertisement get the [ __ ]

3529.599 --> 3532.6400000000003
out

3530.319 --> 3533.92
i don't care where it is get the [ __ ]

3532.64 --> 3535.839
out

3533.92 --> 3537.28
so i would really appreciate that if

3535.839 --> 3539.2
some of you

3537.28 --> 3541.119
would do that as well with my comment

3539.2 --> 3542.0789999999997
section because i can't keep track of it

3541.119 --> 3545.119
anymore just

3542.079 --> 3547.28
i'm not even trying it's just if i

3545.119 --> 3551.599
happen to bump into something

3547.28 --> 3551.599
i'll like clear it out or whatever but

3553.04 --> 3558.48
800 plus shows with

3556.319 --> 3559.92
comment sections each one of them you

3558.48 --> 3563.28
know

3559.92 --> 3565.599
it's kind of a a lot can't keep track of

3563.28 --> 3565.599
all that

3566.24 --> 3570.319
yeah and i really do appreciate how

3568.24 --> 3573.839
everybody with the wrench in chat is

3570.319 --> 3573.839
having patience with these

3574.359 --> 3579.5989999999997
sphericity nonsense numpties

3581.839 --> 3590.0
evidence i am evidence i am evidence

3586.48 --> 3592.079
i have minor telepathy through empathy

3590.0 --> 3594.799
it's very strainful

3592.079 --> 3595.52
but and when pressurized situations

3594.799 --> 3601.839
happen

3595.52 --> 3601.839
it it just works

3602.48 --> 3606.48
right and that doesn't mean oh i can

3604.4 --> 3609.44
just oh

3606.48 --> 3611.28
what am i thinking right now no no no i

3609.44 --> 3613.44
could actually guess that pretty well

3611.28 --> 3615.6800000000003
at times if i know the individual a

3613.44 --> 3617.28
little better right that includes trolls

3615.68 --> 3619.5989999999997
i eventually just figure you

3617.28 --> 3621.2000000000003
out right it's all about figuring you

3619.599 --> 3624.1600000000003
out and when you're figured out

3621.2 --> 3625.9199999999996
then i can literally predict you like i

3624.16 --> 3628.5589999999997
can predict animal behavior

3625.92 --> 3631.2000000000003
that's [ __ ] right yeah yeah because

3628.559 --> 3634.3190000000004
it's not that difficult

3631.2 --> 3634.319
if you got the skill

3635.839 --> 3644.88
right but generally i'm pretty good

3639.68 --> 3644.8799999999997
at trying to guess somebody's

3645.2 --> 3649.2799999999997
mental responses or just what they're

3647.76 --> 3651.5200000000004
thinking or especially what they're

3649.28 --> 3652.3190000000004
feeling inside you know i have a lot of

3651.52 --> 3655.359
insight on

3652.319 --> 3657.68
in their feeling workings and yeah

3655.359 --> 3658.88
it's always very funny how people try to

3657.68 --> 3661.359
gaslight you

3658.88 --> 3662.48
all the time about that you can't do it

3661.359 --> 3664.96
you know why

3662.48 --> 3666.319
because they can't face honesty when it

3664.96 --> 3666.96
comes to their feeling lives there's a

3666.319 --> 3669.52
lot of people

3666.96 --> 3670.88
in the world that can never be honest

3669.52 --> 3673.359
about what they're feeling

3670.88 --> 3674.88
ever and so when somebody's really good

3673.359 --> 3678.0
at reading it

3674.88 --> 3678.559
they have to attack you they must attack

3678.0 --> 3681.839
you

3678.559 --> 3682.88
because they know that you can read them

3681.839 --> 3685.04
and they

3682.88 --> 3687.04
have to keep it a secret so they will do

3685.04 --> 3688.64
anything to keep it a secret including

3687.04 --> 3691.04
attacking innocent people

3688.64 --> 3693.04
that aren't even interested because you

3691.04 --> 3694.96
figured out they got that skill

3693.04 --> 3699.839
yeah i learned it from real life

3694.96 --> 3699.839
freaking experience

3706.799 --> 3714.559
i've had it a lot it's not pleasant

3710.64 --> 3717.92
because at times the gas lighting works

3714.559 --> 3719.28
yeah people cat gaslighted me about what

3717.92 --> 3722.4
i am what i could do

3719.28 --> 3725.3590000000004
and then at some point i believed it

3722.4 --> 3727.359
what an idiot but yeah freaking peer

3725.359 --> 3729.839
pressure from all sides and without

3727.359 --> 3732.48
proper guidance

3729.839 --> 3734.64
you know my parents were not good at

3732.48 --> 3737.68
psychological warfare

3734.64 --> 3740.96
at all i had to freaking teach

3737.68 --> 3745.359
them okay because they were real

3740.96 --> 3745.359
numpties at it really stupid

3745.92 --> 3753.2000000000003
they've gotten well my mother died

3749.2 --> 3755.1189999999997
eventually fortunately my dad has

3753.2 --> 3758.16
never become a champion at it but at

3755.119 --> 3760.799
least he understands it

3758.16 --> 3761.2799999999997
and he respects me for my insight and

3760.799 --> 3764.0
he's

3761.28 --> 3766.4
he listens in on me sometimes just when

3764.0 --> 3768.96
i explain things

3766.4 --> 3771.6800000000003
because he has very empathic senses as

3768.96 --> 3773.839
well it's a different ability though

3771.68 --> 3775.0389999999998
it's a different way he uses he just can

3773.839 --> 3778.64
read feelings

3775.039 --> 3778.6400000000003
pretty easily he just doesn't

3779.16 --> 3783.839
psychoanalyze as much

3789.44 --> 3793.68
you defended my abilities did you oh i

3792.079 --> 3797.8390000000004
thought that you were defending the

3793.68 --> 3797.839
other guy

3799.76 --> 3804.7990000000004
thought you were being sarcastic

3801.92 --> 3804.799
influenza

3805.2 --> 3810.319
like who are you to defend me on these

3808.72 --> 3824.24
abilities since when are you

3810.319 --> 3827.119
a believer in anything i say in defense

3824.24 --> 3829.2
right well mata young it's not my

3827.119 --> 3831.28
intelligence people have to be careful

3829.2 --> 3833.4399999999996
for though because i utilize my

3831.28 --> 3836.3190000000004
intelligence a lot

3833.44 --> 3838.0
for diplomacy and social dynamics just

3836.319 --> 3839.92
to make things smoother

3838.0 --> 3843.359
i have to be careful for my feelings

3839.92 --> 3843.359
though because i do have those

3843.599 --> 3849.52
and when you piss me off yeah there's

3846.72 --> 3849.52
all these tears

3849.92 --> 3854.96
and so yeah you don't want to push too

3851.68 --> 3854.96
far right

3859.92 --> 3867.839
right well there you go

3863.119 --> 3867.839
see totally got it

3869.039 --> 3873.28
see in france because i get you

3873.92 --> 3877.44
because you're in my chat talking

3875.92 --> 3879.92
responding

3877.44 --> 3881.2000000000003
sending out these certain types of

3879.92 --> 3884.88
feeling pulses

3881.2 --> 3885.5989999999997
that i can pick up this not from your

3884.88 --> 3889.44
words but

3885.599 --> 3891.839
from you through the words

3889.44 --> 3894.799
and so i can profile you as an

3891.839 --> 3898.0789999999997
individual how you respond to things and

3894.799 --> 3898.48
that way i can size you up as seeing

3898.079 --> 3901.119
that

3898.48 --> 3903.2
it was blatantly obvious sarcastic and

3901.119 --> 3904.319
you can't guess like me into thinking it

3903.2 --> 3908.48
wasn't

3904.319 --> 3909.52
because i know you now see even i've

3908.48 --> 3911.039
never met you

3909.52 --> 3913.0389999999998
i've never met you i don't even know

3911.039 --> 3916.4
what you look like i don't even know if

3913.039 --> 3916.4
indifference is your real name

3916.88 --> 3920.319
but i know what you're like

3920.4 --> 3924.2400000000002
and that's what you're going to be

3921.68 --> 3926.96
feeling and thinking on average

3924.24 --> 3929.2799999999997
depending on certain reflections you

3926.96 --> 3934.319
give off through your communication

3929.28 --> 3934.3190000000004
that i pick up on yeah that's how i do

3934.839 --> 3939.44
it

3937.599 --> 3941.119
what's your native language i think it's

3939.44 --> 3951.839
dutch

3941.119 --> 3951.839
if i remember correctly

3952.4 --> 3957.6800000000003
that's why i pronounce it in dutch

3954.799 --> 3965.839
should have picked up on that

3957.68 --> 3965.839
well you probably who cares

3969.359 --> 3972.24
wow again what

3973.2 --> 3979.839
so you're not dutch

3989.119 --> 3994.0
or you you're just nagging me trying to

3992.079 --> 3996.2400000000002
break the cohesion try to break my

3994.0 --> 3999.039
confidence by never confirming anything

3996.24 --> 4000.3999999999996
and just keeping gaslighting me right

3999.039 --> 4003.44
if you're gonna keep doing that i'm just

4000.4 --> 4006.1600000000003
gonna eventually ban you i don't even

4003.44 --> 4007.92
know why you have been unbanned

4006.16 --> 4009.68
why i've even left you in this chat

4007.92 --> 4011.599
because you're overall just a very

4009.68 --> 4013.7599999999998
annoying influence every time you speak

4011.599 --> 4013.76
up

4015.839 --> 4020.319
wow forgetting your native language

4017.52 --> 4023.839
right yeah well it's not that difficult

4020.319 --> 4026.24
yeah is that real do you really think

4023.839 --> 4035.839
that that is a wow moment

4026.24 --> 4035.839
for real

4045.52 --> 4049.599
ban you no because i still feel it have

4047.92 --> 4052.88
the feeling you're being just

4049.599 --> 4053.3590000000004
sarcastic and it's annoying me so why

4052.88 --> 4056.96
are you

4053.359 --> 4057.52
wowing for such relatively trivial

4056.96 --> 4063.839
things

4057.52 --> 4063.839
it's not that hard to figure out

4066.16 --> 4070.48
or maybe again maybe it is really hard

4069.2 --> 4072.96
to figure out for you

4070.48 --> 4073.52
it just happens to be really easy for me

4072.96 --> 4075.76
maybe

4073.52 --> 4078.48
maybe that's the point where we've

4075.76 --> 4080.7990000000004
arrived right now

4078.48 --> 4081.76
and you are a baller yes you have that

4080.799 --> 4084.319
for you

4081.76 --> 4086.0
you you have the ball tardation

4084.319 --> 4088.839
influence so yeah that

4086.0 --> 4092.48
does like scale down your abilities

4088.839 --> 4092.48
significantly that is true

4096.319 --> 4105.839000000001
oh what did mn say this time

4115.6 --> 4120.56
okay well that's cool then in infants

4120.88 --> 4126.4800000000005
i guess i can't criticize you for

4125.199 --> 4133.12
just trying to be nice and

4126.48 --> 4136.0
straightforward at this point

4133.12 --> 4137.199
so never mind about the uh the banning

4136.0 --> 4138.64
i'll just leave it to that

4137.199 --> 4140.5599999999995
and i'm gonna round out the show wow

4138.64 --> 4144.719
we've been

4140.56 --> 4147.1990000000005

way it's kind of nice to

4153.679 --> 4161.839

4155.92 --> 4161.839
