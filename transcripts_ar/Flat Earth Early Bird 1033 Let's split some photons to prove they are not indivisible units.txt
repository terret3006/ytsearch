so

107.439 --> 112.83999999999999
the weather today

109.84 --> 115.28
i thought it was gonna be exactly like

112.84 --> 117.92
yesterday it's in the morning it was

115.28 --> 119.04
super bright sky and sunny

117.92 --> 121.84
and then

119.04 --> 121.84
this happened

122.079 --> 127.119
so yeah pretty thick cloud bank

125.36 --> 131.039
is moving over there doesn't seem to be

127.119 --> 131.039
coming any rain out of it so far

131.12 --> 137.20000000000002
it's taking all the sun away and it is

133.04 --> 137.2
like it's constant wind

139.52 --> 142.8
so that's

141.04 --> 144.56
to be careful with the doors again

142.8 --> 146.87900000000002
because with this kind of wind like

144.56 --> 149.04
everything starts to ram closed and all

146.879 --> 149.04
that

156.959 --> 159.76
bit restless

163.84 --> 169.68
right so

165.68 --> 171.76000000000002
hello matthew mitchell first in chat

169.68 --> 177.08
it is tuesday

171.76 --> 177.07999999999998
the 5th of october 2021

181.84 --> 185.36
i'll be doing a two-hour show today as

184.08 --> 188.53900000000002
usual

185.36 --> 188.53900000000002
[Music]

188.56 --> 192.72
ah flat earth debates is finally back

194.8 --> 199.59900000000002
and nathan did sound very focused and

198.319 --> 201.28
well rested

199.599 --> 203.11999999999998
yesterday so yeah

201.28 --> 204.879
he just needed a

203.12 --> 206.48000000000002
a week off

204.879 --> 209.28
i guess

206.48 --> 214.64
he's back anyway

209.28 --> 214.64000000000001
huh hello pj crew shank good to see you

216.08 --> 223.36
all right so yeah i'm gonna

220.08 --> 224.87900000000002
i was looking i thought i need to get my

223.36 --> 226.87900000000002
note

224.879 --> 230.64
my notes back

226.879 --> 230.64
so i'm going to keep track of that again

230.879 --> 236.319
because a lot of things i've just

232.879 --> 238.39999999999998
started to notice are slipping me by

236.319 --> 240.79899999999998
it's a kind of a waste i shouldn't just

238.4 --> 243.12
make notes again and i am going to do

240.799 --> 243.12
that

249.439 --> 253.439
right so yeah i've been uh

252.159 --> 255.92
been gaming

253.439 --> 258.4
and got pretty late last night so the

255.92 --> 260.239
thing that i said yesterday i didn't do

258.4 --> 262.479
all probably yeah i did do that this

260.239 --> 262.479
night

263.199 --> 269.12
definitely going to put a break on that

266.84 --> 271.28
today because i like finally got the

269.12 --> 276.28000000000003
hang of it and then it was really yeah

271.28 --> 276.28
with the game it was tough to let go so

283.12 --> 286.96
so yeah maybe a little bit more tired

285.6 --> 288.88
than usual

286.96 --> 290.88
but still

288.88 --> 293.44
just

290.88 --> 296.08
it'll be all right

293.44 --> 299.199
uh

296.08 --> 299.199
what was going down

302.16 --> 304.56
right

305.84 --> 310.71999999999997
so after flat earth debate

309.199 --> 313.36
uh yeah

310.72 --> 316.8
stuck watching some infowars

313.36 --> 319.759
as usual and later

316.8 --> 322.08
made by jim bob went live again

319.759 --> 322.84000000000003

327.28 --> 330.23999999999995
but yeah

330.56 --> 335.88
i kind of

332.32 --> 335.88
stuck to jimbob

344.72 --> 348.16
all right hello

346.32 --> 351.479
sicarious

348.16 --> 351.47900000000004
gaining wisdom

364.56 --> 369.44
oh yeah i did take notice of the

367.759 --> 371.73
gerunds clip

369.44 --> 373.039
mushrooms on mars

371.73 --> 374.8
[Music]

373.039 --> 378.28
like it's just funny

374.8 --> 378.28000000000003
a little detail

381.28 --> 385.59999999999997
all right

382.4 --> 388.08
okay pg crew shank thanks

385.6 --> 391.199
looking forward to that

388.08 --> 391.199
hello believer

392.0 --> 395.0
hhh

399.039 --> 403.4
i don't know what boroshaka means

413.039 --> 416.71999999999997
right so i'm pretty much open for

417.44 --> 421.759
any subject if it's not going to be too

419.44 --> 425.039
heavy

421.759 --> 427.84000000000003
also i'd like to hear back from uh

425.039 --> 427.84
isles g

430.96 --> 434.96
about

431.84 --> 437.75899999999996
like his potential toothache situation

434.96 --> 441.919
because he gave note that my tip did

437.759 --> 441.91900000000004
help him and i'm just curious as to

442.08 --> 446.639
yeah

443.039 --> 446.639
how did it work out in the long run

447.199 --> 455.639
for me this is all just data gathering

451.52 --> 455.639
but i'm really glad it helped

476.24 --> 479.84000000000003
hello slow mo moon buggy

492.319 --> 495.319
so

517.519 --> 520.519
uh

530.48 --> 536.24
oh hello classical homeopath you want to

533.04 --> 536.24
talk about own benjamin

536.72 --> 541.519
what do you think of the criticisms you

539.04 --> 541.519
receive

542.64 --> 545.64
what

550.0 --> 553.64
oh which ones

575.519 --> 582.16
right i did notice by the way he had a

578.88 --> 584.88
stream from yesterday but i haven't been

582.16 --> 586.8
i haven't gotten to watching it yet

584.88 --> 588.24
so i don't know

586.8 --> 591.56
what was on there

588.24 --> 591.5600000000001
just yet

594.48 --> 597.6800000000001
this operation is a little bit like a

596.64 --> 601.48
cult

597.68 --> 601.4799999999999
well in what sense

605.279 --> 608.48
i mean

607.04 --> 609.8389999999999
that's

608.48 --> 611.04
like i

609.839 --> 613.839
most of the

611.04 --> 615.519
criticisms that flow in his direction

613.839 --> 618.0790000000001
and all that

615.519 --> 620.48
it's the same type of [Â __Â ] that i get

618.079 --> 622.64
right like ooh flat earth is a cult this

620.48 --> 622.64
just

623.12 --> 628.16
i don't see the cult

625.92 --> 630.3199999999999
right it's all open and information it's

628.16 --> 630.3199999999999
all

630.8 --> 634.399
freedom of choice but

634.56 --> 637.92
also

635.6 --> 640.5600000000001
yeah consequences

637.92 --> 643.76
and there is just the thing that's going

640.56 --> 643.76
like an unspoken

644.56 --> 647.56
system

653.839 --> 656.839
wait

676.72 --> 679.9200000000001
i mean like seriously

678.48 --> 682.0790000000001
musical that

679.92 --> 684.64
that started to happen

682.079 --> 686.16
like the moment he started to doubt the

684.64 --> 687.68
moon landing

686.16 --> 689.12
right because you're going to realize

687.68 --> 693.519
that he's got a

689.12 --> 695.76
he comes from a very broad base

693.519 --> 695.76
right

697.36 --> 702.24
like i don't have it as far as i know is

699.92 --> 704.56
super broad base i mean i have some

702.24 --> 707.519
familiarity

704.56 --> 708.8
but it's not like oh i had this thing

707.519 --> 711.6
going

708.8 --> 714.399
and then suddenly i switched to flat

711.6 --> 719.0400000000001
earth no i came in

714.399 --> 719.04
with flat earth so it's different

720.48 --> 725.76
and because of his broad base yeah

723.04 --> 728.16
there's going to be

725.76 --> 732.399
pretty severe responses psychologically

728.16 --> 734.7199999999999
against what he did resistance and

732.399 --> 737.92
unwillingness and then people will just

734.72 --> 737.9200000000001
start saying occult

738.079 --> 741.4399999999999
because they don't want to deal with it

743.12 --> 748.88
a lot of these accusations are really

745.279 --> 748.88
not very well thought through

749.68 --> 754.88
and there's some gammas that really like

751.68 --> 759.399
make giant conspiracy theory stories

754.88 --> 759.399
but it's blatantly nonsense

760.0 --> 765.279
based on conjured mindsets and

762.8 --> 768.959
motivations that are just there's no

765.279 --> 771.959
evidence for that no trace evidence

768.959 --> 771.959
so

777.92 --> 783.88
you don't have to be sorry

780.079 --> 783.88
that's okay dude

786.72 --> 790.8000000000001
it happens there's just some people that

788.639 --> 793.6800000000001
are really paranoid

790.8 --> 795.92
and butthurt about him

793.68 --> 799.04
but it was he had did expect it he

795.92 --> 800.88
basically said like why and how he's all

799.04 --> 802.24
explained that like

800.88 --> 804.56
a year ago

802.24 --> 804.5600000000001
more

805.2 --> 809.6
they're just butt hurt

806.959 --> 811.1199999999999
and he's he always does a sacred cup

809.6 --> 812.72
slaughterhouse

811.12 --> 815.68
for his comedy

812.72 --> 818.5600000000001
and that even aggravates it

815.68 --> 821.76
because he effectively is doing it on

818.56 --> 823.92
purpose so those that choose to be

821.76 --> 826.88
in this agreement or but heard over it

823.92 --> 829.12
yet they are gonna be constantly

826.88 --> 832.519
making themselves an emotional target

829.12 --> 832.519
because of that

862.16 --> 864.48
right

866.399 --> 871.12
yeah pj chris yanks well

868.72 --> 873.6
there's a weird situation about it it's

871.12 --> 877.279
more like a

873.6 --> 879.6
band of fellow adventurers in a way

877.279 --> 880.959
because owen benjamin doesn't like cult

879.6 --> 883.279
people

880.959 --> 887.3599999999999
like typical cult people are just very

883.279 --> 887.36
good at being obedient and all that

887.839 --> 892.24
and like following the rules like the

890.16 --> 895.199
moment they are laid out by cult leaders

892.24 --> 899.399
or the cult priesthood

895.199 --> 899.399
he doesn't like that

900.0 --> 904.44
he doesn't like those types of people

920.8 --> 928.56
i mean he likes cooperation in work

924.399 --> 930.399
situations of course a good workflow

928.56 --> 932.7199999999999
but he just wants everybody to be

930.399 --> 933.92
individuals and thinking about their own

932.72 --> 938.399
things

933.92 --> 940.639
like that's really that stands out to me

938.399 --> 941.68
and and that doesn't work in a cult

940.639 --> 943.759
because

941.68 --> 946.16
a cult leader

943.759 --> 948.16
effectively is very alone

946.16 --> 950.959
because all the followers

948.16 --> 954.24
are just doing what they say

950.959 --> 957.199
but none of them know him

954.24 --> 958.5600000000001
there's nobody to reflect upon

957.199 --> 960.399
their level where they're at what

958.56 --> 962.88
they're doing and they have to even keep

960.399 --> 966.32
secrets from their cult followers

962.88 --> 968.56
right it's an unpleasant situation

966.32 --> 971.12
and that's just

968.56 --> 973.8389999999999
so opposite of how

971.12 --> 977.44
owen benjamin operates

973.839 --> 977.44
and what he's built around him

978.959 --> 981.959
right

985.759 --> 990.88
right his own benjamin wants that

987.68 --> 990.88
connection he wants to

992.0 --> 994.8
joke around

995.199 --> 1000.8
and then get a response then see like

997.279 --> 1005.36
what people genuinely reflect on like

1000.8 --> 1005.3599999999999
yeah it that's what he does

1007.12 --> 1011.44
and it's born out of stand-up comedy

1009.44 --> 1013.519
like that's where that started that's

1011.44 --> 1015.0400000000001
where he figured out that social

1013.519 --> 1016.399
interaction

1015.04 --> 1019.04
alchemy

1016.399 --> 1021.839
and that's

1019.04 --> 1025.639
what's become part of how he is and how

1021.839 --> 1025.6390000000001
he likes to do things

1025.839 --> 1030.319
even on a personal level to some extent

1028.559 --> 1032.799
i think

1030.319 --> 1032.799
i did

1033.36 --> 1039.0
i hope i got it right i think i got it

1035.439 --> 1039.0
right anyway

1051.28 --> 1055.44
oh oh really slow mo moon buggy

1056.96 --> 1060.64
so you got kind of pulled into flat

1059.28 --> 1064.0
earth

1060.64 --> 1064.0
thanks to owen benjamin

1065.44 --> 1070.8400000000001
or were you already

1067.039 --> 1070.84
like on it

1089.84 --> 1092.84

1118.0 --> 1121.28
moon buggy then i have to thank owen

1119.84 --> 1123.4399999999998
benjamin

1121.28 --> 1125.36
for that

1123.44 --> 1127.76
because you're a great guy to have

1125.36 --> 1127.76
around

1130.88 --> 1133.6000000000001
in my view

1134.48 --> 1138.72
hello moon shadow good to see you

1143.12 --> 1146.2399999999998
what is that freaking

1144.96 --> 1149.799
buzz

1146.24 --> 1149.799
sound ah

1160.559 --> 1165.2
i'm a tad bit [Â __Â ] at times

1163.2 --> 1168.4
okay slow mo moon buggy

1165.2 --> 1171.1200000000001
wells we all are at times so

1168.4 --> 1173.2800000000002
i definitely cannot exclude myself from

1171.12 --> 1173.28
that

1174.88 --> 1179.44
i feel a bit slow today

1176.84 --> 1181.4399999999998
myself that's because of the combination

1179.44 --> 1185.039
of it now being stormy and me not

1181.44 --> 1185.039
basically not having slept enough

1190.64 --> 1196.2800000000002
i'll make sure tomorrow i'll be in a

1192.48 --> 1196.28
little bit better condition

1252.159 --> 1256.7990000000002
oh

1253.44 --> 1256.799
you changed your name did you

1258.08 --> 1263.559
yeah you it's aries curse of man okay

1275.25 --> 1278.369
[Music]

1294.0 --> 1299.36
now what comes next for fv what is

1296.48 --> 1301.6
everybody hoping for

1299.36 --> 1301.6
well

1302.4 --> 1309.039
why are you asking classical homeopath

1305.52 --> 1309.039
like why are you not asking me

1316.72 --> 1322.4
i mean sure i'd like to hear a classical

1318.799 --> 1322.4
homeopaths attempt

1327.76 --> 1333.44
all right sicarius yeah i agree

1330.4 --> 1338.44
and so does aries 106

1333.44 --> 1338.44
and he's been around for a long time so

1356.48 --> 1361.84
all right

1357.76 --> 1361.84
what is everybody hoping for

1374.96 --> 1379.039
i think a lot of flat earthers are

1376.559 --> 1381.76
probably hoping for a mainstream

1379.039 --> 1381.76
transition

1382.48 --> 1386.799
but

1384.32 --> 1389.9189999999999
the to me that seems like a foolish hope

1386.799 --> 1392.48
in these in the current state

1389.919 --> 1394.0800000000002
of the world

1392.48 --> 1395.52
because what i think

1394.08 --> 1397.84
in the sense

1395.52 --> 1399.039
what is next

1397.84 --> 1400.32
for us

1399.039 --> 1402.1589999999999
well

1400.32 --> 1404.0
we have to deal with the c and the v

1402.159 --> 1406.24
situation first and everything that

1404.0 --> 1409.76
comes rolling out of that i mean we

1406.24 --> 1409.76
could still just keep going but

1414.24 --> 1418.64
like flat earth as well as as it was

1416.559 --> 1420.32
always going to be

1418.64 --> 1423.44
has become

1420.32 --> 1425.36
just like a cog in a whole range of

1423.44 --> 1428.24
things

1425.36 --> 1428.24
that are happening

1428.72 --> 1434.64
and there's just a lot of like

1432.08 --> 1436.48
spiritual development in battle now in

1434.64 --> 1440.0
other regions

1436.48 --> 1444.2
like the sea situation has effectively

1440.0 --> 1444.2
distracted away

1444.24 --> 1448.559
right like it's not the time for it now

1446.799 --> 1450.799
when people would say

1448.559 --> 1453.36
in my personal opinion like

1450.799 --> 1456.72
like yeah we don't have time for flat

1453.36 --> 1459.6789999999999
earth right now we have to deal with the

1456.72 --> 1462.88
with the lockdowns and

1459.679 --> 1464.72
i'd say like yeah i can't blame you for

1462.88 --> 1466.5590000000002
saying that

1464.72 --> 1468.96
it's kind of true

1466.559 --> 1468.96
you see

1471.039 --> 1474.72
and hey even as flat earthers there's a

1473.44 --> 1477.2
lot that we

1474.72 --> 1479.039
can do to support

1477.2 --> 1480.88
the development

1479.039 --> 1482.48
in the resistance

1480.88 --> 1487.279
because of the

1482.48 --> 1490.96
most mostly the analytical skills

1487.279 --> 1493.44
because of our disposition in society

1490.96 --> 1495.279
that we don't believe mainstream things

1493.44 --> 1497.8400000000001
pretty much by default and we have good

1495.279 --> 1497.84
reason to

1498.32 --> 1501.32
and

1501.36 --> 1507.279
a lot of people are really entangled

1503.919 --> 1509.919
into the regular world

1507.279 --> 1514.52
and job situations and all that

1509.919 --> 1514.5200000000002
we can just keep a lookout for details

1522.08 --> 1528.8799999999999
like in my own right i have done that by

1525.6 --> 1531.6
dragging in rudolph steiner and by

1528.88 --> 1533.44
dragging in germany medicine and terrain

1531.6 --> 1535.4399999999998
theory

1533.44 --> 1537.919
like that

1535.44 --> 1537.919
i did

1538.64 --> 1544.0
because i had knowledge of it and i had

1541.039 --> 1547.12
no objection to to do that like i'm a

1544.0 --> 1547.12
flat earther anyway

1548.24 --> 1553.36
it's not like oh because of this i'm

1550.48 --> 1553.3600000000001
sadly gonna

1553.76 --> 1557.52
lose some kind of license or whatever or

1556.24 --> 1559.679
a job

1557.52 --> 1562.08
so

1559.679 --> 1562.0800000000002
boom

1563.36 --> 1568.32
and hey lots of flat earthers all

1566.72 --> 1570.4
they deal with flat earth and they deal

1568.32 --> 1572.3999999999999
with other subjects a lot

1570.4 --> 1575.3600000000001
it's been a habit for a long time to

1572.4 --> 1579.3600000000001
kind of mix flat earth in with

1575.36 --> 1582.32
just regular health and maintenance and

1579.36 --> 1585.6789999999999
like how to avoid

1582.32 --> 1588.1589999999999
allopathic medical system etc etc and

1585.679 --> 1591.799
that's even before

1588.159 --> 1591.7990000000002
the sea situation

1598.48 --> 1602.24
also of course because of the sea

1600.559 --> 1604.24
situation

1602.24 --> 1606.24
we've been doing a lot of reflecting and

1604.24 --> 1607.279
we haven't been alone non-flat earthers

1606.24 --> 1610.24
too

1607.279 --> 1612.08
upon history and recent history to kind

1610.24 --> 1614.64
of explain like what is this mind

1612.08 --> 1616.3999999999999
control thing going on has it happened

1614.64 --> 1619.5200000000002
before

1616.4 --> 1622.24
and how do we recognize it

1619.52 --> 1624.039
in kind of a slurry of

1622.24 --> 1627.1200000000001
rewritten

1624.039 --> 1630.32
propagandized history

1627.12 --> 1632.1589999999999
with still registered facts

1630.32 --> 1633.36
but then like

1632.159 --> 1635.8400000000001
yeah

1633.36 --> 1638.24
filled in to kind of serve a propaganda

1635.84 --> 1638.24
purpose

1639.44 --> 1643.279
and so there's been a lot of

1640.72 --> 1645.6000000000001
reconstruction as to what has really

1643.279 --> 1647.12
happened

1645.6 --> 1648.559
like in the

1647.12 --> 1650.8799999999999
first half of the

1648.559 --> 1652.8799999999999
20th century

1650.88 --> 1656.48
that's also been a lot of flat earthers

1652.88 --> 1660.159
that have been like dual working on that

1656.48 --> 1662.88
it's a very valuable

1660.159 --> 1667.0800000000002
thing to develop

1662.88 --> 1667.0800000000002
to untangle history

1668.72 --> 1674.799
because it does help you know

1671.84 --> 1677.84
if you figure out history then

1674.799 --> 1681.12
it's very likely it'll help you to

1677.84 --> 1682.84
figure out current situation

1681.12 --> 1686.0
because

1682.84 --> 1688.399
controllers or the controlling spirit

1686.0 --> 1691.679
the methodology

1688.399 --> 1696.9189999999999
is very the ones that work

1691.679 --> 1696.919
they just apply straight out

1697.279 --> 1703.6
they're very repetitive and so yeah if

1700.0 --> 1705.679
you manage to recognize the history

1703.6 --> 1707.6
and look through the propaganda that was

1705.679 --> 1708.96
kind of used to cover it up make it look

1707.6 --> 1711.6789999999999
different

1708.96 --> 1715.039
then you can just recognize the methods

1711.679 --> 1718.64
and then also figure out solutions very

1715.039 --> 1721.919
quickly because now it's an internet age

1718.64 --> 1724.159
figure out connect very quickly

1721.919 --> 1726.7990000000002
in relation to 100 years ago when that

1724.159 --> 1728.7990000000002
wasn't there and world dependent on

1726.799 --> 1731.279
telegraph

1728.799 --> 1731.279
letters

1731.84 --> 1735.6789999999999
bird messages all that but that took

1734.48 --> 1737.44
ages

1735.679 --> 1739.2
and you didn't always even know if it

1737.44 --> 1742.72
was being received

1739.2 --> 1745.039
right so that's a big difference

1742.72 --> 1747.44
and we should use that advantage while

1745.039 --> 1749.44
it's still there

1747.44 --> 1752.3990000000001
and we are all of us

1749.44 --> 1756.52
like speaking for all of humanity

1752.399 --> 1756.52
awakened humanity

1768.159 --> 1773.3200000000002
ah cool slow mo moon buggy that's cool

1788.32 --> 1794.1589999999999
you you know that

1790.399 --> 1796.559
in these days considering flat earth i

1794.159 --> 1797.7600000000002
never bring it up anymore in my real

1796.559 --> 1800.799
life

1797.76 --> 1803.84
what i now do instead

1800.799 --> 1803.84
is try to

1803.919 --> 1810.64
to define to read

1806.559 --> 1813.039
the people to figure out if they get it

1810.64 --> 1816.0
like basically see if there is like an

1813.039 --> 1817.679
energy pattern difference

1816.0 --> 1820.559
because

1817.679 --> 1822.88
like globe belief does leave its traces

1820.559 --> 1824.399
in the personality

1822.88 --> 1827.3600000000001
something i've noticed

1824.399 --> 1830.2399999999998
so even if it's never been brought up

1827.36 --> 1831.6
by the behavior you can almost already

1830.24 --> 1832.559
tell

1831.6 --> 1835.1999999999998
if

1832.559 --> 1837.6
like like a percentage of delusion it's

1835.2 --> 1839.6000000000001
really interesting and also it goes in

1837.6 --> 1841.12
all directions it includes

1839.6 --> 1842.8799999999999
gay

1841.12 --> 1844.2399999999998
yeah

1842.88 --> 1845.279
it's weird

1844.24 --> 1846.88
they're there

1845.279 --> 1848.64
i've noticed that

1846.88 --> 1854.48
globe belief

1848.64 --> 1854.48
v gay trans facts zombies

1855.52 --> 1860.08
it's kind of in that direction

1860.64 --> 1864.48
and

1861.84 --> 1866.6399999999999
the more of that you've let

1864.48 --> 1868.96
stick to your soul the more you're going

1866.64 --> 1870.64
to be pulled into that frequency of

1868.96 --> 1872.64
behavior and it's all kind of the same

1870.64 --> 1875.679
frequency in ways

1872.64 --> 1878.72
the seductions and the prices

1875.679 --> 1881.44
are kind of the same

1878.72 --> 1884.32
and so i just like to

1881.44 --> 1886.0800000000002
decipher people without even bringing up

1884.32 --> 1889.6789999999999
the subjects now

1886.08 --> 1892.8799999999999
i'm basically the weirdo

1889.679 --> 1895.039
in the long leather black jacket just

1892.88 --> 1898.0
staring at people

1895.039 --> 1901.44
but not awkwardly

1898.0 --> 1904.48
but i just don't really talk to people

1901.44 --> 1907.44
i just don't i've become even more

1904.48 --> 1909.76
of a mute

1907.44 --> 1912.48
i'm just like psionically staring into

1909.76 --> 1912.48
people's heads

1912.88 --> 1916.96
and i will address when spoken to

1914.64 --> 1920.72
absolutely and i do even like at the

1916.96 --> 1922.08
cashier as the cash registry

1920.72 --> 1923.919
i just mentioned the weather or

1922.08 --> 1925.6789999999999
something

1923.919 --> 1928.3200000000002
and then i use the opportunity to

1925.679 --> 1929.8400000000001
basically define the mood of the person

1928.32 --> 1932.799
that responds

1929.84 --> 1932.799
to figure out like

1933.2 --> 1937.8400000000001
how constructed is their response in

1935.679 --> 1938.88
other words how nervous are they about

1937.84 --> 1941.1999999999998
me

1938.88 --> 1944.88
and that also gives a whole bunch of

1941.2 --> 1946.559
framework backdrop potential as to where

1944.88 --> 1949.279
they're coming from it's

1946.559 --> 1952.799
dude i can't stop divining

1949.279 --> 1952.799
i can't stop it anymore

1958.96 --> 1961.96
ah

1962.88 --> 1969.7990000000002
that's not true i can't stop it but i'm

1965.519 --> 1969.799
just not really stopping it

1978.24 --> 1984.24
who is going to do research on light and

1980.72 --> 1986.72
photons who's going to make fe map

1984.24 --> 1991.08
who is going to work out what the sun is

1986.72 --> 1991.08
where is this learned

1991.76 --> 1995.2
the mfe map we

1998.96 --> 2006.64
well making it true fe map or just

2002.799 --> 2009.519
the real map a real model

2006.64 --> 2013.6000000000001
that will require

2009.519 --> 2013.6
opportunity flexibility and

2016.84 --> 2022.0
prosperity it requires a freedom of the

2019.84 --> 2023.6
world's minds

2022.0 --> 2026.399
that they're not burdened by the sea

2023.6 --> 2028.8799999999999
situation really the sea situation is

2026.399 --> 2030.4799999999998
like indirect opposite of that

2028.88 --> 2032.24
opportunity

2030.48 --> 2034.24
like it's not it's going to make it not

2032.24 --> 2036.08
work

2034.24 --> 2038.08
to do that

2036.08 --> 2040.559
figuring out the map because it requires

2038.08 --> 2042.8799999999999
just in world explanation

2040.559 --> 2045.8799999999999
exploration

2042.88 --> 2045.88
scanning

2055.119 --> 2060.96
yeah as for the lights

2056.879 --> 2063.359
and photon research yes just people

2060.96 --> 2064.879
kind of casually doing trying it out on

2063.359 --> 2066.72
them on their own

2064.879 --> 2069.359
i think that

2066.72 --> 2073.3199999999997
john d is trying stuff out

2069.359 --> 2073.3199999999997
and that is interesting

2075.28 --> 2078.8790000000004
dude i'll just be here theorizing about

2077.919 --> 2081.5989999999997
it

2078.879 --> 2084.3199999999997
as soon as i get an angle as soon as i

2081.599 --> 2084.32
got something

2084.48 --> 2090.72
i'm still resting on my very very early

2088.48 --> 2093.679
maybe too soon theory

2090.72 --> 2096.1589999999997
about light being infinitely divisible

2093.679 --> 2096.159
beams

2096.399 --> 2101.2
and

2097.839 --> 2104.96
not photon not wave

2101.2 --> 2107.1189999999997
oh well photon it is a convention but

2104.96 --> 2109.44
it's not a particle it's not a wave it's

2107.119 --> 2112.48
an infinitely divisible beam

2109.44 --> 2114.64
and then there's the diffraction cascade

2112.48 --> 2118.8
effect what happens when light moves in

2114.64 --> 2118.7999999999997
very close proximity to a surface

2121.119 --> 2127.599
which i distinctly separate from the

2124.8 --> 2128.88
notion that's in my opinion completely

2127.599 --> 2131.04
lame

2128.88 --> 2133.119
that matter does the same thing it

2131.04 --> 2135.68
doesn't and it doesn't prove that light

2133.119 --> 2138.48
is a particle at all diffraction in

2135.68 --> 2140.8799999999997
matter never goes beyond three bands

2138.48 --> 2143.119
never ever

2140.88 --> 2144.48
and light does it

2143.119 --> 2147.04
so much

2144.48 --> 2149.52
so many times

2147.04 --> 2151.68
it's not the same thing at all like at

2149.52 --> 2154.16
all it's embarrassing anytime somebody

2151.68 --> 2157.48
suggests that

2154.16 --> 2157.48
in my opinion

2158.56 --> 2164.16
so i'll just be theorizing about that

2161.92 --> 2166.2400000000002
and see what happens i don't think i

2164.16 --> 2168.72
think that that is a viable

2166.24 --> 2170.56
direction because people could just do

2168.72 --> 2173.68
it in their own basement

2170.56 --> 2176.32
doesn't really require free exploration

2173.68 --> 2176.3199999999997
of the world

2180.88 --> 2186.28
uh

2182.48 --> 2186.28
what was the other one

2188.16 --> 2190.96
and who is going to work out what the

2189.76 --> 2193.5200000000004
sun is

2190.96 --> 2193.52
nobody

2195.839 --> 2199.0
i mean

2200.88 --> 2206.2400000000002
there could be more tests like when is

2203.839 --> 2207.7599999999998
finally somebody gonna try to to

2206.24 --> 2210.0
actually

2207.76 --> 2211.5200000000004
get an angular size change in the sun

2210.0 --> 2214.32
for example

2211.52 --> 2216.32
like just a try

2214.32 --> 2218.079
i don't know some kind of a zeppelin or

2216.32 --> 2220.88
something

2218.079 --> 2223.3590000000004
drone zeppelin thingy

2220.88 --> 2226.2400000000002
doesn't have to be big

2223.359 --> 2230.24
just like okay just go to the sun then

2226.24 --> 2230.24
name it icarus let's see what happens

2230.32 --> 2232.7200000000003
you know

2232.96 --> 2237.2
who knows maybe my mind will be

2234.88 --> 2240.7200000000003
absolutely blown as it is revealed like

2237.2 --> 2240.72
holy [Â __Â ] apparently

2241.2 --> 2246.3199999999997
there is something euclidean about the

2243.44 --> 2246.32
sun after all

2246.72 --> 2250.0789999999997
i don't know i haven't seen it

2253.04 --> 2257.599
there's only one thing that even

2255.359 --> 2259.359
remotely gives a hint

2257.599 --> 2261.599
that there might be something euclidean

2259.359 --> 2264.24
about it and that's that one piece of

2261.599 --> 2266.56
footage high balloon footage

2264.24 --> 2269.52
that i saw very early on but i've only

2266.56 --> 2272.88
ever seen one example of this

2269.52 --> 2272.88
i think it's the dog cam

2274.64 --> 2278.4
and you see like a spotlight of the sun

2277.68 --> 2280.24
on

2278.4 --> 2284.56
like sheep clouds

2280.24 --> 2287.52
and the sun lea just looks unusually big

2284.56 --> 2290.16
but that's like

2287.52 --> 2292.0
yeah it's still that's not even it

2290.16 --> 2294.0789999999997
doesn't prove angular size change

2292.0 --> 2297.359
because it's just like oh hello open

2294.079 --> 2300.4
eyes oh look this is what you see

2297.359 --> 2303.359
doesn't prove angular size change

2300.4 --> 2306.32
it just proves like what

2303.359 --> 2308.72
what is this this is definitely not a

2306.32 --> 2311.839
ball of fire very far away and the

2308.72 --> 2314.3999999999996
spotlight is very surreal but in that

2311.839 --> 2316.16
sense the spotlight effect

2314.4 --> 2320.64
more supports

2316.16 --> 2320.64
the holographic surreal nature of it all

2320.88 --> 2324.4
right that's what i got out of that

2325.28 --> 2331.119
it's support that none of it actually

2327.599 --> 2333.6800000000003
makes any sense if it was like a literal

2331.119 --> 2335.119
spotlight in a location

2333.68 --> 2338.24
that you would

2335.119 --> 2339.44
see that from that high up and not lower

2338.24 --> 2341.04
down and

2339.44 --> 2344.64
it just

2341.04 --> 2344.64
the sun is so surreal

2346.079 --> 2348.4
right

2348.48 --> 2353.76
so yeah that was very elaborate

2351.76 --> 2356.48
but good question

2353.76 --> 2356.48
moonshadow

2365.04 --> 2368.8
mainstream people do what they do well

2366.8 --> 2370.88
mainstream people are just trying to

2368.8 --> 2373.44
milk the herd

2370.88 --> 2373.44
that's all

2374.56 --> 2379.2799999999997
whatever makes the herd squirt

2377.2 --> 2381.5989999999997
that's what they'll be doing

2379.28 --> 2383.28
they don't care in actual knowledge

2381.599 --> 2385.6800000000003
development they don't care about that

2383.28 --> 2386.5600000000004
they just want to exploit whatever comes

2385.68 --> 2387.52
up

2386.56 --> 2389.92
whatever

2387.52 --> 2393.04
makes the world squirt that's what

2389.92 --> 2394.7200000000003
they'll be doing that's the mainstream

2393.04 --> 2397.119
right

2394.72 --> 2401.1189999999997
that's what it is it's very mechanized

2397.119 --> 2401.119
there's no real development

2401.68 --> 2405.9199999999996
just refinement of the manipulation

2408.96 --> 2412.319
right

2411.359 --> 2415.119
and

2412.319 --> 2417.359
also cult formation that

2415.119 --> 2420.88
i have to say that

2417.359 --> 2420.88
mainstream media

2421.119 --> 2428.4
has become more

2423.44 --> 2428.4
like cult leaders than they've ever seen

2433.119 --> 2437.2000000000003
they actually do

2434.88 --> 2440.76
act like that they do just want the

2437.2 --> 2440.7599999999998
obedient followers

2459.359 --> 2464.4
how will flat earthers convinced

2461.44 --> 2467.4
mainstream physicists

2464.4 --> 2467.4
uh

2467.52 --> 2472.72
that's not difficult at all

2469.92 --> 2474.96
all you have to do is just

2472.72 --> 2476.68
get real with the physics and then

2474.96 --> 2479.44
reveal

2476.68 --> 2483.9199999999996
presuppositional based mistakes

2479.44 --> 2487.28
and assumption based mistakes um

2483.92 --> 2488.88
yeah what typical physicists deal with

2487.28 --> 2491.0400000000004
what what they might have overlooked

2488.88 --> 2493.04
it's not that difficult really like you

2491.04 --> 2495.359
don't actually have to even bring up

2493.04 --> 2497.359
flat earth

2495.359 --> 2500.0789999999997
you don't even have to say the word you

2497.359 --> 2500.0789999999997
can still just

2500.4 --> 2504.96
for example gas pressure without a

2501.92 --> 2509.599
container is a very solid

2504.96 --> 2511.839
grounded in physics argument it's

2509.599 --> 2511.839
yeah

2513.28 --> 2518.6400000000003
you don't necessarily have to

2515.68 --> 2520.72
draw into question the shape of earth

2518.64 --> 2522.96
with that it could just be about like

2520.72 --> 2525.839
okay outer space

2522.96 --> 2527.119
gas pressure on earth no no container

2525.839 --> 2528.96
wall

2527.119 --> 2530.96
how does this work

2528.96 --> 2533.599
right they don't have to think about oh

2530.96 --> 2535.44
is it a ball is it flat no it's just you

2533.599 --> 2538.1600000000003
can leave that out and it's still

2535.44 --> 2538.16
something that's

2539.04 --> 2544.079
that yeah maybe some of the physicists

2541.119 --> 2545.599
just really don't want you to touch that

2544.079 --> 2547.92
ball

2545.599 --> 2550.92
you can still make them ponder on that

2547.92 --> 2550.92
part

2553.44 --> 2560.079
convince them that spectroscopy is wrong

2556.079 --> 2562.0
well that is also not too difficult

2560.079 --> 2565.3590000000004
you can just

2562.0 --> 2567.119
get detailed about what spectroscopy is

2565.359 --> 2568.48
how it works

2567.119 --> 2571.76
and how the

2568.48 --> 2574.48
kind of divining process of celestial

2571.76 --> 2576.8390000000004
spectroscopy is just a mockery

2574.48 --> 2580.2400000000002
because spectroscopy has all

2576.839 --> 2582.0789999999997
these mechanical issues like you have to

2580.24 --> 2583.839
have like a

2582.079 --> 2584.7200000000003
vacuum chamber

2583.839 --> 2587.2799999999997
or

2584.72 --> 2589.839
the gases in between are going to

2587.28 --> 2593.28
distort the reading

2589.839 --> 2595.599
oh guess what doesn't happen

2593.28 --> 2597.8390000000004
in celestial spectroscopy yeah they

2595.599 --> 2600.0
don't draw a vacuum there's no direct

2597.839 --> 2601.599
connection to the material it's all just

2600.0 --> 2603.839
like oh

2601.599 --> 2606.6400000000003
look in that direction imagine like it's

2603.839 --> 2609.2
spectroscopy you're doing that's what it

2606.64 --> 2611.44
is it's a complete mockery

2609.2 --> 2612.8799999999997
of the real spectroscopy

2611.44 --> 2615.88
engineering

2612.88 --> 2615.88
technology

2627.76 --> 2631.599
so yeah there is a long road

2631.68 --> 2637.359
but yeah that's look what if somebody

2635.2 --> 2639.04
starts studying physics why do they do

2637.359 --> 2641.359
it do they do it because they want to

2639.04 --> 2643.92
know they want to understand

2641.359 --> 2645.7599999999998
or they want to be

2643.92 --> 2648.64
a wizard

2645.76 --> 2651.6800000000003
and be like i'm so smart i i've read all

2648.64 --> 2654.16
this stuff i know it all by heart

2651.68 --> 2656.72
and that makes me smart

2654.16 --> 2659.52
because if therefore in it for that

2656.72 --> 2661.52
it's much more likely that their lack of

2659.52 --> 2664.72
natural curiosity will make them

2661.52 --> 2667.92
overlook the mistakes in favor of

2664.72 --> 2670.319
convenience and then they will typically

2667.92 --> 2673.119
start utilizing

2670.319 --> 2675.119
machinations

2673.119 --> 2677.44
because they will start to aim for the

2675.119 --> 2680.56
more popular white ground which is more

2677.44 --> 2683.2000000000003
filled with delusions

2680.56 --> 2686.56
right so yeah as a physicist

2683.2 --> 2688.96
when you're young and you get into that

2686.56 --> 2692.0789999999997
do you really want to know

2688.96 --> 2694.48
and face the consequences of knowing

2692.079 --> 2697.6800000000003
which is also conjoined by the

2694.48 --> 2700.16
realization that the world

2697.68 --> 2702.48
the majority of it is kind of delusional

2700.16 --> 2705.92
and misinformed

2702.48 --> 2707.839
and other people exploit that

2705.92 --> 2710.48
do you want to face that it's like a

2707.839 --> 2712.16
pretty punishing social

2710.48 --> 2715.68
realization

2712.16 --> 2716.839
that comes along with genuine

2715.68 --> 2720.319
frontline

2716.839 --> 2722.72
discovery exploration feeling

2720.319 --> 2724.56
that you get that pulls other physicists

2722.72 --> 2726.319
that the poor physicists in that just

2724.56 --> 2728.319
want to understand that just really want

2726.319 --> 2731.52
to get it and

2728.319 --> 2732.56
maybe at first oh more technology

2731.52 --> 2736.24
right

2732.56 --> 2736.24
then they'll probably become an engineer

2738.72 --> 2741.72
so

2754.16 --> 2756.64
all right

2759.119 --> 2764.319
right

2760.48 --> 2764.319
and it's also very ironic that

2764.64 --> 2769.68
physics will eventually also touch upon

2767.359 --> 2769.68
god

2770.88 --> 2775.7200000000003
like

2771.68 --> 2775.72
yeah that also happens

2775.839 --> 2780.0
it's even kind of a standardized saying

2779.04 --> 2782.48
i think

2780.0 --> 2784.4
it's pops it's so standardized that

2782.48 --> 2786.16
you'll even find it back in games i

2784.4 --> 2788.64
don't remember who said it

2786.16 --> 2791.1189999999997
maybe it was fan feynman

2788.64 --> 2794.0
somebody like that that yeah you start

2791.119 --> 2794.0
out an atheist

2794.4 --> 2798.96
when you get into physics but then at

2796.16 --> 2802.8799999999997
the end of the road you you're no longer

2798.96 --> 2804.88
an atheist you you know

2802.88 --> 2806.079
the bottom of the glass

2804.88 --> 2807.839
started the

2806.079 --> 2811.119
filled glass you think you're an atheist

2807.839 --> 2811.119
but at the bottom you know

2813.599 --> 2817.1600000000003
because it's true

2817.28 --> 2824.599
if you wanna get real

2820.24 --> 2824.5989999999997
then finding out is inevitable

2837.92 --> 2841.7200000000003
hello hester smith

2875.0 --> 2878.48
photoelectric effect discovered by

2877.2 --> 2880.8799999999997
einstein

2878.48 --> 2880.88
no

2883.2 --> 2887.9199999999996
oh thank you america silver patriot for

2886.16 --> 2889.04
the five dollar super chat donation

2887.92 --> 2891.92
truth

2889.04 --> 2891.92
capital letters

2894.96 --> 2897.119
no

2899.599 --> 2904.4
yeah the photoelectric effect doesn't

2902.079 --> 2906.8
prove a photon

2904.4 --> 2906.8
at all

2907.839 --> 2911.7599999999998
it just proves that there is a direct

2911.92 --> 2919.359
correlation well a causation perhaps

2916.4 --> 2922.64
now there's just a direct link between

2919.359 --> 2922.64
light and electricity

2922.96 --> 2926.559
but it interacts with matter that's

2924.64 --> 2929.7999999999997
pretty much it it doesn't prove a photon

2926.559 --> 2929.8
or anything

2932.48 --> 2936.72
and hey solar panels can be very

2934.8 --> 2937.6800000000003
effective

2936.72 --> 2940.0
but

2937.68 --> 2944.16
it's not a good system for

2940.0 --> 2944.16
centralized electricity production

2944.64 --> 2951.0789999999997
because

2945.599 --> 2951.079
its strength wanes over distance

2962.24 --> 2965.9599999999996
hey daniel field

2974.319 --> 2978.64
the photovoltaic effect what

2981.68 --> 2985.0
what is that

2991.68 --> 2995.2799999999997
ah right yeah yeah

2997.28 --> 3002.52
electric current immaterial exposed to

2999.28 --> 3002.52
light yeah

3015.44 --> 3018.839
let me check

3021.37 --> 3024.56
[Applause]

3044.64 --> 3049.44
that's funny that's kind of the same

3046.88 --> 3050.319
thing except that photoelectric effect

3049.44 --> 3053.319
is

3050.319 --> 3053.319
modeled

3055.04 --> 3058.48
like

3055.92 --> 3060.48
how much light before

3058.48 --> 3063.92
matter gets charged enough that an

3060.48 --> 3063.92
electron bumps out

3066.88 --> 3071.52
right that absolutely doesn't prove by

3069.599 --> 3074.88
the way again

3071.52 --> 3074.88
that light is a particle

3077.599 --> 3080.839
at all

3089.2 --> 3094.16
yeah i know a moon shadow i heard

3091.76 --> 3094.1600000000003
but it's

3094.839 --> 3101.119
ridiculous i think he probably won that

3097.359 --> 3103.839
nobel prize because of the re them

3101.119 --> 3106.4
the angle of approach because they were

3103.839 --> 3106.4
trying to

3107.119 --> 3110.119
participate

3112.4 --> 3119.76
right it was used

3115.68 --> 3120.8799999999997
to make assume that light was a particle

3119.76 --> 3122.8390000000004
it's not

3120.88 --> 3126.2400000000002
and it doesn't prove it i've explained

3122.839 --> 3128.5589999999997
it quite a few times like for two years

3126.24 --> 3128.5589999999997
now

3131.28 --> 3136.3190000000004
like i even already integrated all of

3134.559 --> 3137.6800000000003
everything that i've explained and how i

3136.319 --> 3139.04
just

3137.68 --> 3140.16
referenced it

3139.04 --> 3141.68
like yeah

3140.16 --> 3144.0
tension builds up

3141.68 --> 3146.72
like there's infinite beams infinitely

3144.0 --> 3149.2
divisible beams of energy

3146.72 --> 3149.2
hitting

3149.76 --> 3155.2000000000003
the material

3151.359 --> 3157.04
and then at some point it is just enough

3155.2 --> 3159.4399999999996
like

3157.04 --> 3161.7599999999998
energy goes that direction

3159.44 --> 3163.359
gets inserted and then at some point the

3161.76 --> 3165.8390000000004
critical mass

3163.359 --> 3167.5989999999997
for an electron to eject is reached and

3165.839 --> 3170.48
then it ejects

3167.599 --> 3173.04
it does not prove oh there's a specific

3170.48 --> 3173.04
unit

3173.359 --> 3179.119
because it directly exchanges oh the

3176.559 --> 3182.7200000000003
photon unit electron unit

3179.119 --> 3182.7200000000003
no not at all

3184.48 --> 3190.76
it's a model thing

3186.48 --> 3190.76
it's how do you model what's happening

3198.079 --> 3201.44
they were able to count the part oh you

3200.559 --> 3204.76
mean

3201.44 --> 3204.76
the electrons

3210.559 --> 3215.6800000000003
it gave way to the double slit yeah but

3212.64 --> 3218.16
why because they figured out

3215.68 --> 3219.9199999999996
the image the photon

3218.16 --> 3222.96
which is basically

3219.92 --> 3226.48
the amount of energy in the form of

3222.96 --> 3229.2
light required for material to

3226.48 --> 3230.079
have that photoelectric switch right

3229.2 --> 3233.5989999999997
it's

3230.079 --> 3236.319
like how much light is enough for that

3233.599 --> 3237.28
effect to happen and that's the photon

3236.319 --> 3239.7599999999998
unit

3237.28 --> 3242.4
doesn't mean that that is literally like

3239.76 --> 3242.4
a particle

3242.72 --> 3248.5589999999997
it's a globule of energy like how much

3246.24 --> 3251.5589999999997
energy is enough for that effect to

3248.559 --> 3251.559
transpire

3266.559 --> 3270.2400000000002
yeah

3267.44 --> 3273.44
so i i literally explained it moonshadow

3270.24 --> 3273.4399999999996
i just explained it

3276.16 --> 3282.319
what is the photon

3278.72 --> 3283.7599999999998
it's not a unit of light

3282.319 --> 3287.52
as in a

3283.76 --> 3290.7200000000003
particle as in an indivisible thing

3287.52 --> 3293.599
it's like a globule of energy it's

3290.72 --> 3296.72
infinitely divisible beams

3293.599 --> 3298.4
that add up to enough energy

3296.72 --> 3302.8799999999997
combined

3298.4 --> 3302.88
to cause the photoelectric effect

3305.599 --> 3313.04
so they yeah when they shoot photons

3308.88 --> 3316.76
it's basically like releasing droplets

3313.04 --> 3316.7599999999998
except it beams

3330.8 --> 3333.929
[Music]

3338.559 --> 3343.28
right well if he's already said it's a

3340.319 --> 3346.16
packet that means they're not

3343.28 --> 3346.1600000000003
like atoms

3346.88 --> 3349.839
they're not units

3353.68 --> 3359.359
it's not one unit of light

3356.72 --> 3361.52
it's not one unit of light if he even

3359.359 --> 3365.52
says it's a packet of energy then that's

3361.52 --> 3365.52
already an admission by description

3366.96 --> 3371.92
i don't know about the wavelength thing

3368.799 --> 3374.88
though i don't see how that is really

3371.92 --> 3374.88
important to anything

3375.839 --> 3378.16
maybe

3380.72 --> 3384.9599999999996
like the whole wavelength and all that

3382.64 --> 3388.24
makes even less sense

3384.96 --> 3391.28
if you are assuming that light is

3388.24 --> 3394.0
a unit an indivisible unit

3391.28 --> 3394.0
a particle

3402.559 --> 3407.0400000000004
yeah moonshadow i know separate packets

3405.119 --> 3408.319
yeah that's right and oh

3407.04 --> 3411.119
if you

3408.319 --> 3413.92
make the packets half that size it

3411.119 --> 3415.92
doesn't register

3413.92 --> 3417.6800000000003
isn't that just amazing it doesn't

3415.92 --> 3420.16
register anymore

3417.68 --> 3422.799
right because it's not enough light

3420.16 --> 3426.5589999999997
energy to trigger the effects it doesn't

3422.799 --> 3428.64
mean that there's not light energy

3426.559 --> 3433.1600000000003
being transferred it's just not enough

3428.64 --> 3433.16
for the photoelectric effect you see

3433.76 --> 3437.76
and

3435.359 --> 3439.2
let me get a little bold

3437.76 --> 3442.4
i'll bet you

3439.2 --> 3445.04
if you take like photon shooters

3442.4 --> 3448.4
and you set them to have strength when

3445.04 --> 3449.92
when one photon would not be enough

3448.4 --> 3451.44
or like

3449.92 --> 3453.6800000000003
half a photon would not be enough to

3451.44 --> 3456.079
trigger the effect i'll bet you that if

3453.68 --> 3457.9199999999996
you directed

3456.079 --> 3460.88
two of these beams

3457.92 --> 3462.88
that would both add up to the strength

3460.88 --> 3464.96
of a single photon and perfectly

3462.88 --> 3466.079
simultaneously with exactly the same

3464.96 --> 3467.359
distance

3466.079 --> 3470.96
launch

3467.359 --> 3474.16
have a photon worth of energy

3470.96 --> 3476.7200000000003
that combined it will trigger the

3474.16 --> 3479.68
photoelectric effect how about that

3476.72 --> 3479.68
how about that

3485.92 --> 3490.48
you can't break a packet oh really

3495.359 --> 3498.0789999999997
yeah you can

3498.96 --> 3502.88
of course you can

3500.559 --> 3504.7200000000003
all light can be split up indefinitely

3502.88 --> 3506.7200000000003
because it's infinitely divisible beams

3504.72 --> 3509.9199999999996
you just take

3506.72 --> 3513.9199999999996
some kind of refractive medium a prism

3509.92 --> 3516.7200000000003
anything and break that photon into

3513.92 --> 3518.96
split it up yeah you can absolutely you

3516.72 --> 3518.9599999999996
can

3520.64 --> 3525.359
there are no yeah there are

3523.2 --> 3527.7599999999998
they just don't register

3525.359 --> 3532.24
you i bet you you can

3527.76 --> 3532.2400000000002
generate half a photon worth of energy

3533.119 --> 3537.599
worth of light i bet you that is a

3535.28 --> 3539.3590000000004
mechanical possibility

3537.599 --> 3543.559
it's just gonna

3539.359 --> 3543.5589999999997
kind of not really register

3544.96 --> 3549.28
separately

3547.2 --> 3551.7599999999998
if there's two

3549.28 --> 3554.48
half a photon worth of energy shooting

3551.76 --> 3556.3190000000004
at the same location with the photo

3554.48 --> 3560.2400000000002
sensitive material

3556.319 --> 3562.4
that together overlapping it like

3560.24 --> 3563.839
infinitely divisible beams

3562.4 --> 3567.6800000000003
both

3563.839 --> 3569.68
enough for half the power

3567.68 --> 3574.3999999999996
of one photon

3569.68 --> 3576.48
that combined certainly overlapping like

3574.4 --> 3577.92
they will actually trigger the

3576.48 --> 3580.92
photoelectric effect that's my

3577.92 --> 3580.92
prediction

3588.24 --> 3592.16
what's a packet

3589.92 --> 3592.96
a package

3592.16 --> 3597.8799999999997
right

3592.96 --> 3597.88
a thing with other things in it

3604.48 --> 3608.799
what it definitely isn't is an infinite

3606.96 --> 3612.0
in

3608.799 --> 3615.64
an indivisible unit a packet is not an

3612.0 --> 3615.64
indivisible unit

3617.839 --> 3623.119
because then

3619.52 --> 3623.119
it would be called a particle

3625.44 --> 3630.48
maybe i'm mixing it all up and kiwi is

3628.64 --> 3632.0789999999997
gonna have a field day with me on this

3630.48 --> 3633.76
he doesn't like it when i do this sort

3632.079 --> 3635.76
of thing

3633.76 --> 3637.76
but

3635.76 --> 3640.88
the description of what i'm talking

3637.76 --> 3640.88
about that stance

3641.2 --> 3646.96
and this just saying no doesn't exist oh

3644.48 --> 3650.079
no you can't create half a photon oh

3646.96 --> 3652.48
really based on what what's the specific

3650.079 --> 3654.4
data that

3652.48 --> 3656.64
declares that it is a mechanical

3654.4 --> 3659.2000000000003
impossibility you could never create

3656.64 --> 3661.1189999999997
half a photon worth of light why

3659.2 --> 3662.0789999999997
if you can size down the amount of

3661.119 --> 3663.839
energy

3662.079 --> 3665.6800000000003
a light emitter

3663.839 --> 3667.359
outputs

3665.68 --> 3669.68
to a photon

3667.359 --> 3672.5589999999997
then why couldn't you

3669.68 --> 3674.24
narrow it down just a little more to

3672.559 --> 3676.96
half a photo why

3674.24 --> 3680.5589999999997
was there a specific

3676.96 --> 3682.0
a specific notification like

3680.559 --> 3684.6400000000003
we tried

3682.0 --> 3686.64
below the photon but then just nothing

3684.64 --> 3688.96
happened like literally

3686.64 --> 3691.1189999999997
the energy wouldn't transit or something

3688.96 --> 3693.2
like the light would not manifest like

3691.119 --> 3694.559
provably not manifest

3693.2 --> 3696.72
right

3694.559 --> 3698.6400000000003
or is it just like yeah yeah half half a

3696.72 --> 3700.799
photon is just not enough to register

3698.64 --> 3702.5589999999997
and according to the assumption that it

3700.799 --> 3703.839
should be a particle that means there is

3702.559 --> 3706.2400000000002
no light

3703.839 --> 3709.64
because it's not enough to be a photon

3706.24 --> 3709.64
that's chanting

3718.0 --> 3721.52
how to face destructive into

3724.839 --> 3732.0
face half a photon is a titan what

3729.44 --> 3734.48
are you talking about animaking

3732.0 --> 3737.799
hello by the way glad to have you here

3734.48 --> 3737.799
in this conversation

3743.53 --> 3746.6490000000003
[Music]

3753.8 --> 3756.849
[Music]

3762.64 --> 3766.44
hello daniel rubbles

3772.079 --> 3776.6400000000003
its size

3775.039 --> 3779.6400000000003
affects the moment

3776.64 --> 3779.64
what

3787.68 --> 3793.0389999999998
the face ooh face yeah it still doesn't

3791.44 --> 3796.16
make it

3793.039 --> 3798.3190000000004
an indivisible unit moonshadow

3796.16 --> 3800.64
nothing you've said so far proves to be

3798.319 --> 3803.44
light is an indivisible unit

3800.64 --> 3806.24
assumed to be a particle nothing nothing

3803.44 --> 3806.2400000000002
you've presented

3807.68 --> 3811.72
and i've addressed everything

3814.16 --> 3818.96
except frequency change because that is

3816.799 --> 3820.4
just so bizarre it's like oh yeah it's a

3818.96 --> 3824.0
unit

3820.4 --> 3826.319
but it has phase change like what are

3824.0 --> 3828.559
you talking about

3826.319 --> 3828.5589999999997
that

3829.52 --> 3834.0
that makes even less sense if it's a

3831.52 --> 3834.0
particle

3835.28 --> 3839.599
and like seriously like how can a prism

3838.0 --> 3841.68
split up

3839.599 --> 3843.039
light

3841.68 --> 3844.799
in like

3843.039 --> 3846.88
that doesn't make sense if it's

3844.799 --> 3849.28
particles none of it makes sense if it's

3846.88 --> 3851.6800000000003
particles light doesn't make sense if

3849.28 --> 3856.2400000000002
it's particles at all doesn't mean it's

3851.68 --> 3856.24
a wave it's not a wave that's [Â __Â ]

3856.319 --> 3861.52
it's just not particles

3858.4 --> 3863.44
doesn't make any damn sense

3861.52 --> 3865.599
on an intuitive level i've predicted i

3863.44 --> 3869.2000000000003
think i'm right about this you would not

3865.599 --> 3871.839
be able to see anything

3869.2 --> 3874.0789999999997
if light were particles like how is are

3871.839 --> 3876.0789999999997
things going to compact how do these

3874.079 --> 3881.48
photon

3876.079 --> 3881.48
traveling vast distances then just

3882.16 --> 3888.52
like compact and replace each like you

3884.64 --> 3888.52
wouldn't see anything

3901.839 --> 3909.0
have i heard of the broad line no

3905.44 --> 3909.0
never heard of that

3912.559 --> 3915.559
god

3931.52 --> 3934.52
hmm

3944.24 --> 3949.0789999999997
matter has waved properly oh goody

3950.799 --> 3957.96
no it's [Â __Â ] it's not matter light

3954.48 --> 3957.96
is not matter

3967.76 --> 3972.6400000000003
it's all just building on the scene

3970.48 --> 3974.799
the only thing they were trying to do is

3972.64 --> 3975.839
make light into a particle because they

3974.799 --> 3978.88
wanted

3975.839 --> 3982.319
everything to be one singular spectrum

3978.88 --> 3985.76
of all things that's what they wanted

3982.319 --> 3989.48
doesn't work that way light is not like

3985.76 --> 3989.48
matter it isn't

4028.799 --> 4034.119
hello net wallace good to see you

4034.4 --> 4039.52
yo sicarius hester smith could you

4036.64 --> 4042.72
please stop bickering

4039.52 --> 4045.28
about about religion

4042.72 --> 4047.2799999999997
in the middle of my hangout

4045.28 --> 4049.44
been going at it for 15 minutes

4047.28 --> 4051.599
bickering back and forth about

4049.44 --> 4054.0
what i assume is the apostle paul or

4051.599 --> 4054.0
whatever

4061.039 --> 4067.4
i'd prefer some contribution to what i'm

4063.68 --> 4067.3999999999996
actually talking about

4077.76 --> 4082.6400000000003
all right i'm not gonna time you out or

4079.359 --> 4082.64
anything but come on

4088.799 --> 4094.839
hey against another on pi rmp good to

4091.68 --> 4094.839
see you

4104.239 --> 4108.879999999999
trying to yeah good luck with that

4106.159 --> 4108.879999999999
nestor smith

4110.48 --> 4114.5599999999995
dude

4111.759 --> 4115.679
sicarious formerly known aries cursor

4114.56 --> 4119.839000000001
man

4115.679 --> 4119.839
he's constantly doing that sort of thing

4121.12 --> 4126.719
i think the guy is addicted to

4123.359 --> 4129.52
the social to conflict

4126.719 --> 4129.52
constantly does

4130.839 --> 4136.08
that it just comes washing in and just

4133.839 --> 4138.5599999999995
like starting his own hangout in the

4136.08 --> 4143.0
chat about something else that's like he

4138.56 --> 4143.0
does that almost every time

4162.719 --> 4166.719
connect wavelength with energy

4173.52 --> 4175.839000000001
okay

4176.0 --> 4178.319
sure

4183.44 --> 4187.44
look i'm not saying that

4185.359 --> 4189.759
wave length

4187.44 --> 4192.96
in light doesn't exist i'm just saying

4189.759 --> 4197.12
it doesn't make any damn sense if it's

4192.96 --> 4197.12
actual indivisible units

4197.52 --> 4202.56
we know as particles then it would make

4200.56 --> 4205.56
very very little sense that's all i'm

4202.56 --> 4205.56
saying

4216.08 --> 4220.159
you thought a photon couldn't be split

4219.199 --> 4221.04
yeah

4220.159 --> 4222.08
i

4221.04 --> 4225.12
that's

4222.08 --> 4227.12
the rumor that everybody gets to hear

4225.12 --> 4229.5199999999995
because it's a particle right oh it's a

4227.12 --> 4233.36
particle

4229.52 --> 4233.360000000001
yeah except it's not

4234.239 --> 4238.239
the only thing it has any relation to is

4236.719 --> 4240.56
like oh look

4238.239 --> 4244.4
this is the minimum amount of light

4240.56 --> 4246.080000000001
energy you need to have a photoelectric

4244.4 --> 4248.159
effect before

4246.08 --> 4250.5599999999995
something happens in the material in

4248.159 --> 4253.599999999999
order to register a difference

4250.56 --> 4255.120000000001
and then that energy quanta is declared

4253.6 --> 4257.280000000001
a photon

4255.12 --> 4260.08
that doesn't mean it's an infinite it's

4257.28 --> 4260.8
an indivisible unit

4260.08 --> 4263.5199999999995
like

4260.8 --> 4265.1990000000005
like an electron is also assumed to be

4263.52 --> 4267.4400000000005
that's also debatable

4265.199 --> 4267.44
or

4268.08 --> 4272.96
like an atom

4269.76 --> 4275.1990000000005
which in each in its own classification

4272.96 --> 4278.2390000000005
its own

4275.199 --> 4280.639999999999
spectrum of effects isn't

4278.239 --> 4282.718999999999
is an indivisible unit because if it is

4280.64 --> 4284.08
divided further then it doesn't function

4282.719 --> 4287.36
like that anymore

4284.08 --> 4290.32
right well light is not that

4287.36 --> 4294.239
how difficult can it be to see this

4290.32 --> 4295.5199999999995
light is not a particle

4294.239 --> 4299.28
it isn't

4295.52 --> 4302.080000000001
it is infinitely divisible

4299.28 --> 4304.8
just won't register it

4302.08 --> 4306.88
because how can you register it if it's

4304.8 --> 4308.159000000001
not enough energy to trigger any

4306.88 --> 4311.12
response

4308.159 --> 4314.08
in material which is

4311.12 --> 4316.239
indivisible units so it has a minimum

4314.08 --> 4318.48
size and therefore a minimum amount of

4316.239 --> 4319.678999999999
energy required for it to have any

4318.48 --> 4320.879999999999
effect

4319.679 --> 4323.679
so light

4320.88 --> 4329.32
for us is bound

4323.679 --> 4329.32
by matter by the size limit of matter

4330.8 --> 4335.04
because matter is all we have

4334.239 --> 4337.759999999999
to

4335.04 --> 4341.36
yeah well to literally reflect it on to

4337.76 --> 4343.76
to register it that it exists

4341.36 --> 4346.799999999999
so if it's not enough to trigger that

4343.76 --> 4350.320000000001
matter from responding then it

4346.8 --> 4350.320000000001
seemingly doesn't exist

4351.92 --> 4355.679
that's

4352.88 --> 4357.4400000000005
the workings that's how it is determined

4355.679 --> 4360.08
to be a particle

4357.44 --> 4362.0
by that baseline assumption like oh if

4360.08 --> 4363.92
it's not enough energy to for matter to

4362.0 --> 4366.32
register then it doesn't exist so it

4363.92 --> 4368.4
means it has to be that unit oh what if

4366.32 --> 4371.28
it was one and a half

4368.4 --> 4373.599999999999
energy worth a photon

4371.28 --> 4373.599999999999
huh

4375.6 --> 4382.08
what if you

4376.719 --> 4382.08
fire two one and a half energy photons

4382.8 --> 4389.28
towards the same location

4385.679 --> 4391.28
would it register three photons worth of

4389.28 --> 4393.28
interaction would there be three photons

4391.28 --> 4395.84
or electrons released

4393.28 --> 4398.84
right these are the questions that i

4395.84 --> 4398.84
asked

4437.44 --> 4443.12
so it's a quanta not

4439.679 --> 4445.679
so there is oh really oh i beg to differ

4443.12 --> 4448.88
moonshadow and i've already suggested

4445.679 --> 4448.88
how to even test that

4449.679 --> 4455.12
to just state there is no half a quanta

4452.159 --> 4459.08
oh really

4455.12 --> 4459.08
what's your evidence for that

4471.28 --> 4477.199
one and a half is twofold

4475.76 --> 4480.08
no

4477.199 --> 4483.36
when you catch yourself saying one and a

4480.08 --> 4486.719
half is two

4483.36 --> 4488.159
there should be like uh hello

4486.719 --> 4490.719
hello

4488.159 --> 4495.44
something wrong here

4490.719 --> 4497.52
no one and a half is not two thanks

4495.44 --> 4500.4
error error

4497.52 --> 4500.400000000001
illogical

4500.88 --> 4505.96
anyway i'll get back to this i'll be

4502.56 --> 4505.96
back in two minutes

4548.88 --> 4551.88
so

4580.8 --> 4585.76
oh and by the way if i turn out to be

4583.28 --> 4588.32
absolutely right about everything that

4585.76 --> 4591.12
i'm saying light being

4588.32 --> 4593.28
infinitely divisible in strength

4591.12 --> 4596.719
the issues with the photoelectric effect

4593.28 --> 4599.199
how everything then i wanted officially

4596.719 --> 4602.2390000000005
to be called the arwynian theorem or the

4599.199 --> 4602.239
arwyn theorem

4602.88 --> 4609.84
because i don't see anybody else

4605.679 --> 4612.32
in history ever even suggesting anything

4609.84 --> 4615.92
like this ever ever

4612.32 --> 4618.799999999999
has anybody ever heard anybody ever

4615.92 --> 4620.4
suggest anything like this anything

4618.8 --> 4623.52
ever

4620.4 --> 4626.08
in over 100 years no

4623.52 --> 4629.6
not a single person

4626.08 --> 4631.28
and that baffles me it it truly baffles

4629.6 --> 4636.04
me

4631.28 --> 4636.04
baffled me when i was much younger too

4652.63 --> 4655.689
[Music]

4668.8 --> 4671.1990000000005
all right

4671.52 --> 4676.56
field of quantum information yeah of

4674.08 --> 4679.5599999999995
course there would be

4676.56 --> 4679.56
right

4680.64 --> 4684.719
dude

4681.92 --> 4688.88
i'm just a theorist i think that they

4684.719 --> 4691.92
probably already know how to do this

4688.88 --> 4693.1990000000005
right get like a whole fractal of micro

4691.92 --> 4695.6
light energy

4693.199 --> 4695.599999999999
going

4696.0 --> 4699.199
who knows what you can do

4699.76 --> 4703.92
once you simply ex

4702.48 --> 4706.718999999999
accept

4703.92 --> 4709.92
light is not an infinitely and

4706.719 --> 4711.84
keep on switching an indivisible unit

4709.92 --> 4715.1990000000005
once you realize it's not indivisible

4711.84 --> 4717.92
then who knows what the limit is

4715.199 --> 4720.159
right the limit is only the interaction

4717.92 --> 4722.64
between matter but if the interaction

4720.159 --> 4725.12
between matter is not

4722.64 --> 4727.04
integral to the process then maybe

4725.12 --> 4729.44
splitting it up might provide some

4727.04 --> 4729.44
function

4730.88 --> 4734.8
like

4732.159 --> 4737.44
recombination

4734.8 --> 4738.719
dude you could have like a

4737.44 --> 4741.919999999999
micro

4738.719 --> 4744.8
light based computer on sub

4741.92 --> 4746.96
photonic energy

4744.8 --> 4748.96
who knows this is science is a science

4746.96 --> 4751.04
fiction who knows maybe you could have

4748.96 --> 4752.719
like a chip

4751.04 --> 4755.04
that just works with

4752.719 --> 4757.6
micro photons

4755.04 --> 4759.6
like light that is so small

4757.6 --> 4762.719
that matter doesn't even ratchet so it's

4759.6 --> 4766.64
just a pure light

4762.719 --> 4766.64
reflecting situation and

4767.44 --> 4771.599999999999
tripping out here

4769.44 --> 4773.44
who knows man

4771.6 --> 4775.04
i just know

4773.44 --> 4777.5199999999995
light being in

4775.04 --> 4780.08
indivisible unit makes absolutely no

4777.52 --> 4780.080000000001
sense to me

4780.8 --> 4788.159000000001
and i have not been presented with like

4783.28 --> 4790.719
conclusive data that proves

4788.159 --> 4792.879999999999
you can only spawn light

4790.719 --> 4795.52
at a minimum of one photon it's

4792.88 --> 4797.84
physically impossible to spawn light

4795.52 --> 4799.6
with less than one photon

4797.84 --> 4802.4800000000005
i mean just because you register you

4799.6 --> 4804.400000000001
don't register it as a singular half

4802.48 --> 4806.239
photon

4804.4 --> 4808.32
with the like photoelectrophile doesn't

4806.239 --> 4810.959999999999
mean there's nothing no energy being

4808.32 --> 4814.719
created it's just not enough to register

4810.96 --> 4816.88
right unless that is specifically

4814.719 --> 4819.04
proven through

4816.88 --> 4821.6
tests

4819.04 --> 4823.44
that you literally cannot spawn

4821.6 --> 4826.639
light energy

4823.44 --> 4829.28
until you do it enough for a singular

4826.639 --> 4831.52
photo right if that is the case then

4829.28 --> 4834.48
yeah then

4831.52 --> 4837.4400000000005
my conception as a problem

4834.48 --> 4839.678999999999
because if you can't split up light

4837.44 --> 4841.919999999999
technologically

4839.679 --> 4844.639
if you can't generate less than a photon

4841.92 --> 4846.639
worth of energy then how could i prove

4844.639 --> 4849.4400000000005
that it exists

4846.639 --> 4851.84
right because only through recombination

4849.44 --> 4855.12
of less than one photon energy could it

4851.84 --> 4858.6
be proven that it's still there

4855.12 --> 4858.599999999999
by recombination

4860.159 --> 4866.799999999999
how could we detect half a photon

4862.8 --> 4870.719
by shooting two half a photon

4866.8 --> 4873.52
in the same place moonshadow that's how

4870.719 --> 4875.84
from two different devices

4873.52 --> 4878.719
perfectly lined up

4875.84 --> 4880.32
shooting half a photon or one and a half

4878.719 --> 4883.12
photon if you will

4880.32 --> 4886.4
towards the exact same photoelectric

4883.12 --> 4888.159
sensitive location

4886.4 --> 4890.879999999999
and then there should be one or in the

4888.159 --> 4892.719
second example three

4890.88 --> 4895.04
photon worth

4892.719 --> 4897.679
of interaction

4895.04 --> 4900.239
and then you can prove with that that

4897.679 --> 4900.2390000000005
it's not

4900.56 --> 4905.120000000001
yeah it will prove it's still there even

4902.96 --> 4906.4
though it's not

4905.12 --> 4909.76
worth

4906.4 --> 4909.759999999999
as a complete photon

4909.84 --> 4914.679
right

4911.04 --> 4914.679
that's my theorem

4923.04 --> 4926.0
how would you know you're firing half a

4924.96 --> 4927.76
photon

4926.0 --> 4930.639
well how would you know you're firing a

4927.76 --> 4931.76
single photon

4930.639 --> 4933.679
right

4931.76 --> 4934.88
because it's sensitive and it can be

4933.679 --> 4937.12
calibrated

4934.88 --> 4940.32
the amount of energy input well you

4937.12 --> 4942.4
start with okay you just down the energy

4940.32 --> 4944.159
make it less

4942.4 --> 4946.08
right you have to size up how much

4944.159 --> 4948.0
energy directly correlates with what

4946.08 --> 4949.84
would be half a photon

4948.0 --> 4954.679
you have to literally

4949.84 --> 4954.679
feel it out by testing it

4959.12 --> 4964.88
isn't that just like the double slitting

4960.88 --> 4964.88
no it's nothing like that at all

4970.239 --> 4974.0
that would be

4971.36 --> 4975.44
or that would be absolutely crazy

4974.0 --> 4978.159
because then it would basically be

4975.44 --> 4979.678999999999
hidden in plain sight that photons are

4978.159 --> 4982.879999999999
not singular

4979.679 --> 4985.76
in the visible units

4982.88 --> 4988.719
maybe it is maybe the

4985.76 --> 4991.84
quantum delay choice whatever it i don't

4988.719 --> 4991.84
know probably not

4993.92 --> 4997.6
sounds similar in approach yeah well but

4995.92 --> 5001.12
it's much simpler though this is not

4997.6 --> 5003.679
about delayed pathways this is about

5001.12 --> 5006.159
establishing how much

5003.679 --> 5011.719
units

5006.159 --> 5011.719
photon globule energy units are arriving

5022.88 --> 5027.1990000000005
but hey if you want if

5024.96 --> 5030.0
my theorem if you want to call that

5027.199 --> 5033.28
quantum physics you want to

5030.0 --> 5035.04
place that in in that area i don't mind

5033.28 --> 5036.639
i don't mind being called a quantum

5035.04 --> 5038.639
physicist i bet

5036.639 --> 5042.76
the rest of all the quantum physicists

5038.639 --> 5042.76
probably will mind

5043.76 --> 5049.52
because this is a layman here

5046.719 --> 5051.12
i've never even set foot in a university

5049.52 --> 5053.52
i know

5051.12 --> 5057.159
don't need to

5053.52 --> 5057.159000000001
just need to be telepathic

5064.8 --> 5069.360000000001
don't they use crystals to split photons

5069.44 --> 5074.638999999999
well if you could split a photon then

5071.36 --> 5074.639
it's already done deal

5076.239 --> 5080.638999999999
if you can split

5078.0 --> 5083.679
a singular photon with a crystal

5080.639 --> 5085.84
yeah then it's not an indivisible unit

5083.679 --> 5085.84
done

5098.88 --> 5103.92
no no moonshadow that doesn't work that

5101.679 --> 5103.92
way

5106.48 --> 5113.839999999999
a single

5108.4 --> 5113.839999999999
molecule of h2o will never be a droplet

5114.48 --> 5119.759999999999
because

5116.56 --> 5121.92
if that is the amount it is in the face

5119.76 --> 5125.280000000001
of its medium

5121.92 --> 5128.719
it's immediately going to dissolve

5125.28 --> 5128.719
so it will not be a droplet

5133.679 --> 5137.92
split

5134.8 --> 5141.6
okay okay well there you go i win george

5137.92 --> 5144.08
sanford if that is true then i win

5141.6 --> 5144.08
i win

5144.48 --> 5151.879999999999
like it's not an indivisible unit done

5148.56 --> 5151.88
i win

5159.28 --> 5164.5199999999995
if what you say is based on anything

5161.28 --> 5164.5199999999995
that is

5168.239 --> 5172.4
different colors are different photos

5177.04 --> 5182.32
how is that a response to that

5179.6 --> 5185.04
diff like different photons oh so it was

5182.32 --> 5189.5199999999995
just one photon and now three photons

5185.04 --> 5189.5199999999995
are coming from that really moon shadow

5191.44 --> 5196.32
how does that make any logical sense

5194.239 --> 5198.5599999999995
so there's literally energy creation

5196.32 --> 5198.5599999999995
then

5198.96 --> 5203.36
if a

5200.4 --> 5206.719
infant indivisible unit

5203.36 --> 5209.5199999999995
suddenly reproduces three

5206.719 --> 5211.6
indivisible units ooh

5209.52 --> 5214.56
seems like a

5211.6 --> 5217.360000000001
natural law breaking happening there by

5214.56 --> 5217.360000000001
that assumption

5220.0 --> 5224.44
energy cannot be destroyed and created

5246.08 --> 5251.76
there's called a bumping particle

5248.88 --> 5254.32
making you crazy no no you were always

5251.76 --> 5254.320000000001
crazy

5262.719 --> 5266.08
oh

5263.52 --> 5267.120000000001
oh seeking star water

5266.08 --> 5269.36
are you

5267.12 --> 5271.599999999999
are you actually backstabbing me over

5269.36 --> 5271.599999999999
that

5272.08 --> 5278.36
right i'm in over my head are you

5274.239 --> 5278.36
actually going there again

5282.32 --> 5286.239
you think i can't call ken wheeler

5284.639 --> 5290.32
technobabble

5286.239 --> 5292.799999999999
because i'm in over my head am i really

5290.32 --> 5292.799999999999
you think

5293.199 --> 5299.199
why didn't you elaborate exactly on how

5296.4 --> 5302.199
i'm in over my head then seeking star

5299.199 --> 5302.199
wars

5339.04 --> 5341.199
no

5341.76 --> 5346.320000000001
no jason mccormack i have no idea where

5343.84 --> 5349.360000000001
you got that that might be way in the

5346.32 --> 5350.4
beginning like as in four or five years

5349.36 --> 5352.08
ago

5350.4 --> 5354.799999999999
when i didn't even have the early bird

5352.08 --> 5356.4
show then and i just got into like just

5354.8 --> 5359.92
heard about ken wheeler watched some

5356.4 --> 5359.92
stuff and i'm like what is this

5360.96 --> 5365.76
oh that's when i might have said like oh

5362.88 --> 5368.400000000001
yeah that's i don't get it right yeah

5365.76 --> 5371.04
that's first encounter yeah i've learned

5368.4 --> 5372.799999999999
a couple of things since then a lot of

5371.04 --> 5375.199
things

5372.8 --> 5379.1990000000005
yeah don't tell me

5375.199 --> 5380.48
ken wheeler is over my head yeah

5379.199 --> 5385.0
or

5380.48 --> 5385.0
provide some proof of that

5405.84 --> 5410.4800000000005
a stream of white light yeah i know

5413.679 --> 5418.8
i don't know how you're getting the

5415.12 --> 5418.8
seven different photons though

5418.88 --> 5422.56
moon shadow this is just first you have

5421.28 --> 5424.239
a stream

5422.56 --> 5427.1990000000005
and then you have seven different

5424.239 --> 5431.32
photons it's like oh really how did that

5427.199 --> 5431.32
switch all of a sudden happen

5462.639 --> 5466.96
so jason

5465.12 --> 5469.36
jason mccormack so you can start would

5466.96 --> 5472.4800000000005
you would you like to address

5469.36 --> 5472.48
what i just talked about

5473.679 --> 5477.84
concerning ken wheeler would you like to

5475.52 --> 5480.96
address what you just said

5477.84 --> 5480.96
or apologize

5481.76 --> 5485.719
for this baseless statement

5509.6 --> 5511.92
what

5513.6 --> 5516.96
no

5514.4 --> 5521.5199999999995
he calls ken

5516.96 --> 5523.04
he calls can tack no babble because it's

5521.52 --> 5525.679
over his head

5523.04 --> 5525.679
no no

5529.76 --> 5535.08
no that's not that's not how i interpret

5532.08 --> 5535.08
that

5567.12 --> 5569.5199999999995
all right

5570.48 --> 5575.28
well if she meant that then she might

5572.88 --> 5578.0
want to actually back that up right now

5575.28 --> 5579.679
and not just stay silent for

5578.0 --> 5581.76
six minutes

5579.679 --> 5585.639
after saying something like that and i

5581.76 --> 5585.639
have addressed it twice

5592.8 --> 5596.2390000000005
yeah moonshadow that doesn't make any

5594.56 --> 5600.52
damn sense dude

5596.239 --> 5600.5199999999995
that's just nonsense now

5625.48 --> 5628.589999999999
[Music]

5634.7 --> 5638.938999999999
[Music]

5641.28 --> 5646.48
all right so next time somebody says

5644.4 --> 5648.4
something like that

5646.48 --> 5650.239
and i'm wrong

5648.4 --> 5652.879999999999
you know it's like oh no no irwin that's

5650.239 --> 5654.799999999999
not what it meant i was meaning yeah he

5652.88 --> 5656.32
doesn't know what he's

5654.8 --> 5659.12
into like

5656.32 --> 5660.88
he is in over his head

5659.12 --> 5662.96
then yeah you could have corrected me

5660.88 --> 5663.92
very quickly but i don't think so

5662.96 --> 5666.56
because

5663.92 --> 5668.4
seeking star wars has said things like

5666.56 --> 5671.1990000000005
that before

5668.4 --> 5675.5199999999995
never does she actually back it up maybe

5671.199 --> 5675.5199999999995
she liked him for some reason

5676.08 --> 5680.88
right but if you're gonna go as far as

5677.6 --> 5683.84
to say like oh arwyn is below

5680.88 --> 5687.28
ken wheeler because he doesn't get him

5683.84 --> 5690.08
that's an extremeness insult extreme

5687.28 --> 5692.239
insult especially considering what he

5690.08 --> 5694.639
dabbles in what he's freaking done to

5692.239 --> 5697.04
himself

5694.639 --> 5697.04
okay

5698.32 --> 5703.84
and if you keep sneaking that in and

5700.48 --> 5705.759999999999
then moving away seeking star wars i am

5703.84 --> 5708.8
going to eventually take

5705.76 --> 5708.8
drastic measures

5710.719 --> 5718.44
either you back up those statements

5714.56 --> 5718.4400000000005
or you keep them to yourself

5744.639 --> 5749.88
we accepted physics

5746.88 --> 5749.88
okay

5765.92 --> 5770.8
all right well moon shadow i don't

5767.52 --> 5772.96
understand why you bring in the photons

5770.8 --> 5774.719
like at all but i do know that white

5772.96 --> 5777.84
light is consistent of the whole full

5774.719 --> 5779.76
spectrum combined i know that

5777.84 --> 5781.4400000000005
you can see it when you split it apart

5779.76 --> 5784.8
with the prism

5781.44 --> 5787.199
i know that

5784.8 --> 5789.119000000001
i don't see how that relates to photons

5787.199 --> 5790.879999999999
though

5789.119 --> 5794.08
like something

5790.88 --> 5796.56
white light is seven quanta that that

5794.08 --> 5796.5599999999995
makes no

5796.84 --> 5800.32
sense to me

5802.4 --> 5808.879999999999
i don't see how that really relates to

5805.679 --> 5810.08
the argument of light being a photon or

5808.88 --> 5813.08
not

5810.08 --> 5813.08
anyway

5822.639 --> 5827.52
all men are right there by all are wrong

5825.679 --> 5831.4800000000005
somewhere yeah some are just a little

5827.52 --> 5831.4800000000005
bit more right than others

5841.6 --> 5846.320000000001
made it for the ending yeah hey owls g

5843.52 --> 5849.679
how are you doing man

5846.32 --> 5849.679
how's the tooth situation

5850.56 --> 5854.88
i'm really curious as to like how things

5853.119 --> 5857.5199999999995
have progressed since you tried out the

5854.88 --> 5857.52
magnesium

5863.76 --> 5869.320000000001
yeah

5865.52 --> 5869.320000000001
and it's raining

5899.76 --> 5902.08
right

5905.76 --> 5911.4400000000005
yeah but i get it moonshadow certain

5909.119 --> 5913.759999999999
frequencies of light

5911.44 --> 5914.719
wave lengths ironically as they call

5913.76 --> 5916.639
them

5914.719 --> 5918.0
frequencies is probably a better

5916.639 --> 5921.119
terminology

5918.0 --> 5923.6
of light yeah they have more effect

5921.119 --> 5923.599999999999
bumping

5923.679 --> 5927.76
bumping electrons from the material

5928.719 --> 5933.199
they just catch

5930.159 --> 5938.92
better i appreciate that

5933.199 --> 5938.919999999999
the way you said it is is decent enough

5939.52 --> 5944.719
oh it it still works

5941.76 --> 5944.719
that's awesome man

5946.96 --> 5949.679
right and it doesn't completely take it

5948.8 --> 5951.84
away

5949.679 --> 5954.4
so that you accidentally forget or

5951.84 --> 5958.719
anything get over courageous but at

5954.4 --> 5960.96
least it it takes away like the nerf

5958.719 --> 5963.199
like the part that like it doesn't make

5960.96 --> 5965.52
you it doesn't get on your nerves

5963.199 --> 5966.799999999999
anymore ironically

5965.52 --> 5969.679
that's what i've

5966.8 --> 5969.679
had from that

5979.04 --> 5981.84
hmm

5992.159 --> 5996.638999999999
i'd love to do is isolate the green well

5994.56 --> 5999.04
moonshadow that should not be difficult

5996.639 --> 5999.04
at all

5999.199 --> 6003.199
at all

6000.8 --> 6003.1990000000005
really

6005.119 --> 6008.759999999999
you use a prism

6009.04 --> 6011.76
so

6009.76 --> 6012.8
if you literally want to split up the

6011.76 --> 6014.88
light

6012.8 --> 6017.1990000000005
and have a purpose for both like okay

6014.88 --> 6019.119
you split up the light in a prism one

6017.199 --> 6020.799999999999
side of the prism

6019.119 --> 6025.28
moves towards

6020.8 --> 6027.4400000000005
a region where it is getting absorbed by

6025.28 --> 6028.639
photoelectric plates

6027.44 --> 6032.08
and the other

6028.639 --> 6035.119
moves i don't know deeper or whatever

6032.08 --> 6037.119
towards an element that absorbs its heat

6035.119 --> 6038.799999999999
for like a radiator

6037.119 --> 6041.44
and then you could have like solar

6038.8 --> 6041.4400000000005
panels that

6042.32 --> 6048.08
yeah a combi system

6045.36 --> 6050.48
with prism blocks or something that

6048.08 --> 6053.04
split up the light

6050.48 --> 6056.48
use the electricity and heat

6053.04 --> 6059.28
a heating element for some kind of a

6056.48 --> 6059.28
heating system

6060.88 --> 6064.119
i don't know

6064.32 --> 6068.4
but yeah splitting up light

6066.48 --> 6070.0
in between the two spectra is not

6068.4 --> 6073.759999999999
difficult

6070.0 --> 6076.0
glass sky prism what the hell's jason

6073.76 --> 6079.84
that makes no bloody sense in your

6076.0 --> 6079.84
freaking concave [Â __Â ] but

6080.719 --> 6083.199
uh

6082.159 --> 6084.0
yeah

6083.199 --> 6085.199
no

6084.0 --> 6088.56
there's no

6085.199 --> 6089.678999999999
sun coming through a piece of glass up

6088.56 --> 6091.679
there

6089.679 --> 6094.4800000000005
the light is pretty damn sure the light

6091.679 --> 6096.2390000000005
is physically manifesting within the

6094.48 --> 6100.718999999999
realm space

6096.239 --> 6103.678999999999
not shining through something onto us

6100.719 --> 6105.199
it's holographic

6103.679 --> 6108.4
but

6105.199 --> 6110.5599999999995
no definitive evidence for this just yet

6108.4 --> 6112.5599999999995
more to be tested as i mentioned earlier

6110.56 --> 6113.84
i'd love to see somebody like take a

6112.56 --> 6116.400000000001
zeppelin

6113.84 --> 6119.04
call it icarus and just go for that sun

6116.4 --> 6120.638999999999
see if you can get actual angular size

6119.04 --> 6124.159
increase

6120.639 --> 6124.159000000001
in its appearance somehow

6125.04 --> 6128.159
and then we'll figure it out

6128.56 --> 6133.400000000001
you do that exactly with glass oh okay

6134.08 --> 6136.719
a better way

6139.6 --> 6143.92
well the most ideal way moonshadow is

6141.92 --> 6148.679
that you somehow

6143.92 --> 6148.679
productively utilize the heat

6152.96 --> 6156.639
well what do you know about heat you

6154.4 --> 6159.119
know heat

6156.639 --> 6160.84
causes expansion of material right it

6159.119 --> 6163.679
starts cause

6160.84 --> 6166.32
pressure so maybe if you could combine

6163.679 --> 6169.92
it with photoelectrics

6166.32 --> 6169.92
and then utilize the heat

6170.159 --> 6173.679
for kind of like a

6172.0 --> 6176.08
a push

6173.679 --> 6180.0
electric generator then maybe you could

6176.08 --> 6180.0
like dual purpose

6180.32 --> 6183.84
the solar panel or something
