anyway yeah today it's a bit cloudy but

80.31 --> 85.08
still yeah you look like this it seems

82.74 --> 92.82
kind of grim but this is more what it's

85.08 --> 99.56
like still plenty of light dry not windy

92.82 --> 103.08
bit cold though yeah very typical and

99.56 --> 105.69
yeah today's the day of fish the

103.08 --> 108.24
fireworks are being sold everywhere so I

105.69 --> 109.02
think it starts somewhere or not I think

108.24 --> 115.02
it's today

109.02 --> 117.959
usually it is like two days before it

115.02 --> 121.649
really starts although other explosions

117.959 --> 124.649
you hear the week before are all from

121.649 --> 126.179
last year or they get it from another to

124.649 --> 128.489
get it from Belgium or Germany where

126.179 --> 130.77
they where it sold pretty much

128.489 --> 133.31900000000002
throughout the year and but now yeah

130.77 --> 136.08
everybody's gonna get their fireworks so

133.319 --> 142.82999999999998

149.099 --> 157.909
Sunday yeah I started up to

152.9 --> 160.84900000000002

Jacko more colored Amanda young

164.989 --> 171.20000000000002
drunken bothered for one one seeking

167.72 --> 174.92
star water awesome Austin Daye Alejo

171.2 --> 178.099
high as Yakko Marcel male nurse dank

174.92 --> 188.08999999999997
yeah good to see you in this last Sunday

178.099 --> 189.95
of 2019 how the year has flown by like

188.09 --> 195.62
before I even realized like the last

189.95 --> 198.94
week was already there next year's gonna

195.62 --> 198.94
be quite a blast I think

208.56 --> 223.14000000000001
last Sunday of the decade huh all right

214.65 --> 223.14000000000001
crazy decade it was so much has changed

226.68 --> 235.54000000000002
yeah you do yeah I I can't even remember

232.81 --> 239.109
it I don't know what I did that last

235.54 --> 242.769
year I still know that last year I was

239.109 --> 247.40900000000002
just preoccupied with trying to start up

242.769 --> 251.579
my channel a little bit more serious and

247.409 --> 251.57899999999998
getting into the early bird show

255.89 --> 258.579
yeah

258.95 --> 266.09
well things are gonna progress the way

262.49 --> 270.29
they are then I have to be careful that

266.09 --> 274.76
the next 10 years are going to pass by

270.29 --> 276.83000000000004
as quickly as this entire year because I

274.76 --> 283.88
think that just so much is going to

276.83 --> 288.71
happen I think that things and settings

283.88 --> 291.76
and are gonna change around as well like

288.71 --> 293.96
the context of the geopolitical

291.76 --> 297.28999999999996
situations and all that it's already

293.96 --> 300.26
just going all over the place so I

297.29 --> 303.71000000000004
predict it geopolitics is turning more

300.26 --> 306.11
and more into speech yes and thinks we

303.71 --> 308.65999999999997
kind of taken for granted to being in a

306.11 --> 313.07
certain setting are already kind of like

308.66 --> 314.90000000000003
teetering flopping around getting kind

313.07 --> 318.01
of weird and predictable well that's

314.9 --> 318.01
going to get even worse I think

323.21 --> 331.15999999999997
yeah well good to hear more so mode in

326.09 --> 340.09
there yeah yeah the Flat Earth debates

331.16 --> 340.09000000000003
have been around for a while so yes

344.86 --> 352.75
yeah well I already kind of felt it

350.26 --> 356.02
coming because things were just moving

352.75 --> 359.35
very quickly in attitudes and angles of

356.02 --> 363.01
approach from the media from the

359.35 --> 365.17
individuals that are in that place would

363.01 --> 367.9
change around much more quickly and

365.17 --> 370.27000000000004
that's just made me feel of speeches

367.9 --> 375.88
because other other parties would

370.27 --> 378.01
respond like equally adapt very quickly

375.88 --> 379.39
in their attitudes and that just made me

378.01 --> 381.13
feel like yeah it's like quick moves

379.39 --> 385.45
it's much quicker it doesn't take as

381.13 --> 394.57
much time anymore so yeah it really does

385.45 --> 397.45
feel bit like speeches hmm so yeah I I

394.57 --> 400.06
wasn't even up that incredibly late but

397.45 --> 403.0
I had a pretty heavy meal because I

400.06 --> 404.49
finally managed to get to make that

403.0 --> 407.11
spaghetti

404.49 --> 408.88
they've been postponing for over a week

407.11 --> 411.75
and had to get new ingredients for but

408.88 --> 414.7
it made it and it was really good and

411.75 --> 417.22
yeah I kind of started making it in the

414.7 --> 419.17
middle of the ball the life ball-busters

417.22 --> 420.85
hangout because it was like yeah I'm

419.17 --> 425.05
really hungry and I'm not gonna settle

420.85 --> 427.77000000000004
for some a couple of scraps I needed a

425.05 --> 430.74
good meal and it took me quite a while

427.77 --> 435.29999999999995
but I was still there at the latter part

430.74 --> 438.67
it was a pretty high energy high buzz

435.3 --> 441.52000000000004
stream again like I don't know maybe it

438.67 --> 445.24
is because Kiwi doesn't do actual live

441.52 --> 448.12
streams enough so that everybody really

445.24 --> 451.69
musters their their full energy when it

448.12 --> 455.5
when he does and yeah it was great such

451.69 --> 457.78
a full panel and yeah Randy was there

455.5 --> 460.51
like the whole old crowd was there and

457.78 --> 462.7
we were all doing great people didn't

460.51 --> 465.90999999999997
even really interrupt one in that or not

462.7 --> 468.76
even by accident like maybe like I think

465.91 --> 470.74
I did it like once or twice and

468.76 --> 472.84
retreated chocolate a little but barely

470.74 --> 474.84000000000003
and nobody got pissed off it was awesome

472.84 --> 478.08
and

474.84 --> 485.38899999999995
it's name that taboo conspiracy was in

478.08 --> 494.639
there and yeah good to have him in there

485.389 --> 496.8
it was awesome yeah I didn't even know

494.639 --> 499.35
that his channel had been deleted I I

496.8 --> 502.91
was subscribed to boo conspiracies I

499.35 --> 505.62
knew he was doing good stuff but yeah

502.91 --> 509.88000000000005
there's many out there and I didn't

505.62 --> 510.51
really follow it but yeah taking a look

509.88 --> 513.8389999999999
again

510.51 --> 517.05
yeah his video was very good it was very

513.839 --> 519.0290000000001
clear very easy to take in that's I

517.05 --> 520.7099999999999
didn't even have to follow the whole

519.029 --> 523.65
thing and that is just what I noticed

520.71 --> 526.86
about it's like it's easy to take it's

523.65 --> 529.74
in a way what the approach that mark

526.86 --> 536.04
Sargent tried as well it's slightly

529.74 --> 538.6800000000001
altered and great that works not the old

536.04 --> 541.62
one Austin Austin Austin I think it

538.68 --> 544.0799999999999
probably happened some time ago his old

541.62 --> 550.94
channel but he made a new channel and he

544.08 --> 555.089
put yeah he basically my created to that

550.94 --> 560.1500000000001
yeah it in retrospect it was probably

555.089 --> 560.1500000000001
during that purge what is it the 10th

563.58 --> 569.97
but yeah he's still active with his new

567.55 --> 569.9699999999999
channel

581.14 --> 585.63
[Music]

582.96 --> 588.86
take care and be

585.63 --> 588.86
[Music]

598.58 --> 610.7700000000001
but anyway yeah I'm a bit start because

607.77 --> 613.26
again I was up very late I the big meal

610.77 --> 616.56
I guess and I really needed some long

613.26 --> 620.91
sleep so I think I slept overall like 10

616.56 --> 623.13
or 11 hours I guess I needed it right

620.91 --> 625.74
thank you dank for the for the link

623.13 --> 638.73
yeah that's taboo conspiracies new

625.74 --> 641.57
channel also right away might just as

638.73 --> 645.45
well use the opportunity if somebody

641.57 --> 647.34
wants to get on with me ever talk maybe

645.45 --> 652.86
about last year or about ball-busters

647.34 --> 654.96
are about anything then tell me and or

652.86 --> 657.75
yeah tell me on skype and I'll give you

654.96 --> 659.88
a call and get you on the show just have

657.75 --> 663.87
a nice calm talk no you don't have to do

659.88 --> 669.36
anything heavy but I'm yeah I'll be open

663.87 --> 672.63
for that or questions somebody wants to

669.36 --> 677.78
get on the panel with me and just asking

672.63 --> 681.35
questions not baller questions so just

677.78 --> 681.35
to clear that up

684.26 --> 690.77
right yeah IgM makes sense and look I

688.22 --> 696.0500000000001
when I ate finally when I did get my

690.77 --> 700.21
spaghetti with special like was it I

696.05 --> 704.78
used to have I always get like this

700.21 --> 708.47
Parmesan cheese like this very pecorino

704.78 --> 714.43
very compact very tasteful cheese and

708.47 --> 718.9100000000001
yes since I try to avoid all forms of

714.43 --> 721.4
sit cow dairy products now except well

718.91 --> 727.1899999999999
except for butter I still take that but

721.4 --> 729.47
I took a a goat cheese alternative

727.19 --> 731.69
pecorino apparently that was there and

729.47 --> 735.89
oh god it's probably gonna taste like

731.69 --> 739.19
goat but no it didn't didn't at all so

735.89 --> 742.01
it was really really great and I had

739.19 --> 745.1
pretty much a double meal because it

742.01 --> 751.37
just was very hungry and I almost ate it

745.1 --> 757.09
all so I was pretty stuffed pretty much

751.37 --> 757.09
had a double dinner what it was great

758.02 --> 765.76
caris the bottom I don't know what that

762.86 --> 765.76
is your check Oh

768.74 --> 772.69
and yeah concerning the time that I go

771.44 --> 777.95
to bed

772.69 --> 780.5300000000001
well that differs a lot it seems that

777.95 --> 784.5500000000001
what I try to aim for yeah I've been up

780.53 --> 786.92
a lot of late late nights also thanks to

784.55 --> 790.37
D life and just a lot of the American

786.92 --> 793.61
activity on YouTube and D life I've been

790.37 --> 797.8100000000001
drawing me in so more than often it kept

793.61 --> 800.48
me up up until between 3:00 and 4:00 but

797.81 --> 802.51
typically try to aim in between 1:00 and

800.48 --> 805.1
2:00

802.51 --> 806.23
that's a very decent time for me to go

805.1 --> 810.59
to bed

806.23 --> 816.88
then I don't get up that late and I did

810.59 --> 823.36
that last night as well but still yeah

816.88 --> 829.34
still got up pretty late one o'clock

823.36 --> 832.22
anyway Oh Christmas tree decoration so

829.34 --> 834.65
chuckle I I don't know their Christmas

832.22 --> 837.14
tree decorations and yeah where does it

834.65 --> 840.1999999999999
come from what was it originally what

837.14 --> 847.49
does it mean what is yeah it's a

840.2 --> 849.7700000000001
cultural trinket that's been yeah that

847.49 --> 853.8100000000001
has a vast history of background

849.77 --> 853.81
meanings and hassle

857.66 --> 862.25
I don't know if you just see it as a

859.55 --> 867.05
decoration that's okay but yeah there

862.25 --> 868.73
are so much context to it that salty

867.05 --> 878.14
balls what do you mean I've never heard

868.73 --> 880.3100000000001
of that or edibles

878.14 --> 882.05
there's the trismus Christmas

880.31 --> 884.1199999999999
decorations and then you have the

882.05 --> 886.52
edibles and yeah these days it's usually

884.12 --> 889.01
something in the direction of cookies or

886.52 --> 895.03
chocolate but I think that originally

889.01 --> 897.5
they were mushrooms and probably

895.03 --> 902.54
psychotropic mushrooms that's probably

897.5 --> 908.45
what it started out way way back during

902.54 --> 910.4
the Christian days but that has been

908.45 --> 914.1700000000001
altered by society as it was

910.4 --> 918.31
incorporated and they took away the

914.17 --> 921.7099999999999
hallucinogens and therefore also the

918.31 --> 922.8699999999999
like the ethereal traditions that came

921.71 --> 926.57
with it I guess

922.87 --> 928.79
from within old paganism and some of

926.57 --> 930.8900000000001
them may have been very dark and I think

928.79 --> 935.27
most of them were probably not but yeah

930.89 --> 937.0699999999999
you know the dark ones grapplers get

935.27 --> 938.99
involved with everything and then give

937.07 --> 940.25
it their own spin so wouldn't be

938.99 --> 943.3100000000001
surprised if there were some really

940.25 --> 945.35
creepy pagans because there's creepy

943.31 --> 949.2199999999999
people among every group during every

945.35 --> 952.88
age but yeah it was probably originally

949.22 --> 955.4300000000001
mushrooms and they changed it when they

952.88 --> 958.43
integrated it through cut Catholicism

955.43 --> 960.0799999999999
probably when they did that when they

958.43 --> 962.9
did it they changed it to cookies in

960.08 --> 966.0500000000001
chocolate or some kind of other basic

962.9 --> 970.64
treats that would be kind of like a food

966.05 --> 974.24
trinket more generalized as a present

970.64 --> 977.09
for make it appealing to kids to get

974.24 --> 979.7
them involved and and get some kind of a

977.09 --> 987.64
family interaction tradition going with

979.7 --> 987.6400000000001
it so that's what I think about it

988.85 --> 994.59
as for the decorations I don't know the

992.25 --> 1005.51
decorations have always been decorations

994.59 --> 1007.9100000000001
and I think originally concerning

1005.51 --> 1011.12
decorations I think you originally it

1007.91 --> 1013.91
was just mostly candles I still remember

1011.12 --> 1016.28
the time when we put actual burning

1013.91 --> 1019.85
candles in the Christmas tree we did

1016.28 --> 1021.68
that for a while very carefully and yeah

1019.85 --> 1025.43
my parents were always very careful with

1021.68 --> 1028.49
that and I was made sure before that

1025.43 --> 1030.38
that because we always had cats that the

1028.49 --> 1033.73
cat we had wouldn't get all aggressive

1030.38 --> 1036.8300000000002
towards the tree and cause mayhem and

1033.73 --> 1040.31
then eventually we switched for a moment

1036.83 --> 1042.6499999999999
too this is all from in in my family

1040.31 --> 1048.77
when I was a kid and eventually switched

1042.65 --> 1050.63
to yeah electric lights because it was a

1048.77 --> 1053.51
little bit safer and they don't didn't

1050.63 --> 1055.2800000000002
have to worry about it all the time but

1053.51 --> 1057.95
yeah in the old days of course there

1055.28 --> 1059.84
were no electric lights maybe didn't

1057.95 --> 1064.5800000000002
take whatever well that's probably not

1059.84 --> 1066.86
available for this kind of thing so it

1064.58 --> 1070.31
was just candles people used candles

1066.86 --> 1072.74
because it was yeah of course you have

1070.31 --> 1075.83
to remember the aspect of what is being

1072.74 --> 1078.65
celebrated from the from the original

1075.83 --> 1081.3799999999999
pagan view and that is the return of the

1078.65 --> 1087.77
light dark days and the return of the

1081.38 --> 1090.0500000000002
light 21st solstice and yeah you do that

1087.77 --> 1090.92
of course if you return off to like by

1090.05 --> 1094.73
little lights

1090.92 --> 1096.1100000000001
so yeah candles is typically probably

1094.73 --> 1102.2
what they used as the original

1096.11 --> 1104.6899999999998
decorations maybe even they put like

1102.2 --> 1109.04
pagan idols or whatever I don't know

1104.69 --> 1111.05
exactly what else they put in there you

1109.04 --> 1115.55
know you can so do so much with such a

1111.05 --> 1117.1699999999998
tradition a Decker a typical decorative

1115.55 --> 1118.6
tradition there's so many things you

1117.17 --> 1122.15
could do with that

1118.6 --> 1125.8899999999999
like religious or family tradition or

1122.15 --> 1125.89
whatever meaning you're gonna tribute

1130.63 --> 1135.65
alright sir check oh well I I still

1133.34 --> 1139.57
remember that that kind of thing even

1135.65 --> 1142.5800000000002
was on the news like oh yeah

1139.57 --> 1145.7
like there were couple of fires this

1142.58 --> 1147.71
Christmas because of Christmas trees

1145.7 --> 1150.41
catching fire through candles and we'll

1147.71 --> 1154.76
be careful with candle so they kind of

1150.41 --> 1156.71
did get the candle thing through well

1154.76 --> 1159.53
through normal liberal media tried to

1156.71 --> 1162.23
get the people aware of candle danger

1159.53 --> 1163.94
during Christmas and that kind of all

1162.23 --> 1167.81
went away because I don't think a lot of

1163.94 --> 1171.55
people still do actually put actual

1167.81 --> 1171.55
candles in Christmas trees

1175.93 --> 1183.01
Kendyl in the tree no why what is so

1178.78 --> 1187.75
globe head about that it's a light it's

1183.01 --> 1192.1299999999999
a light that that can be there even if

1187.75 --> 1193.78
electricity is off but yeah you have to

1192.13 --> 1195.7600000000002
be careful with how you install that

1193.78 --> 1197.83
thing if you got to put the candle like

1195.76 --> 1199.36
in the middle of the tree yeah of course

1197.83 --> 1203.47
it's good and doesn't catch fire but

1199.36 --> 1206.02
that's not how you install that man try

1203.47 --> 1211.38
to put them on the the more outer edges

1206.02 --> 1211.3799999999999
of the branches away from the tree

1216.48 --> 1222.55
well Zep tepi that is what the general

1220.12 --> 1224.7099999999998
media always like to put on everyone

1222.55 --> 1226.99
that's like the consensus approach is

1224.71 --> 1230.4
that yeah the celebration of Christ well

1226.99 --> 1233.11
that's the celebration of their

1230.4 --> 1238.26
Luciferian Christ it's the Freemason

1233.11 --> 1240.8799999999999
Christ it's the astrological

1238.26 --> 1244.36
personification of Christ with what the

1240.88 --> 1247.5700000000002
Gnostics made of it the Sun and the Sun

1244.36 --> 1249.6999999999998
cycle in the the three days that's how

1247.57 --> 1253.54
they've rearranged a lot of the Bible

1249.7 --> 1255.55
and adapted it to be well you could say

1253.54 --> 1258.79
the astrological christ the gnostic

1255.55 --> 1261.8799999999999
christ the solar christ and that's

1258.79 --> 1265.21
really what's being celebrated and and

1261.88 --> 1266.92
the persona or and the integration of

1265.21 --> 1269.8600000000001
that concept into the bible that's

1266.92 --> 1271.63
really every time people celebrate

1269.86 --> 1273.1899999999998
christ and how it's been portrayed

1271.63 --> 1277.3200000000002
that's what's being celebrated it's

1273.19 --> 1279.49
always the the specific timings and that

1277.32 --> 1282.54
arrangement of the story that's always

1279.49 --> 1288.42
been so much emphasized during Christmas

1282.54 --> 1288.42
you know you might have noticed that

1291.53 --> 1299.04
so yeah astronomical that's the Christ

1295.44 --> 1301.14
that's really that's the part of that

1299.04 --> 1303.03
concept that's being forwarded every

1301.14 --> 1306.1200000000001
time by media and being repeated and

1303.03 --> 1308.31
being integrated into into media

1306.12 --> 1311.9699999999998
products stories Christmas stories

1308.31 --> 1314.3999999999999
that's the part you know this is true so

1311.97 --> 1316.65
every time somebody says yeah it's all

1314.4 --> 1318.63
about celebrating Christ well no it's

1316.65 --> 1320.46
not really about celebrating Jesus

1318.63 --> 1323.22
Christ and what it was really like now

1320.46 --> 1327.57
it's celebrating the this return of the

1323.22 --> 1331.32
son gnostic Christ their version what

1327.57 --> 1335.28
they made of it but yeah and that it is

1331.32 --> 1342.87
kind of a diss at the original esoteric

1335.28 --> 1347.1
Christ what he really stood for but yeah

1342.87 --> 1351.6599999999999
is what it is I say if you're just aware

1347.1 --> 1354.57
of it you can look they'd the return of

1351.66 --> 1357.8100000000002
the Sun the daylight grown longer is in

1354.57 --> 1361.23
a celebrated celebrating celebration

1357.81 --> 1362.9099999999999
worthy occasion in my opinion but as

1361.23 --> 1366.63
long as you just realize that the actual

1362.91 --> 1370.2
Jesus Christ doesn't have too much to do

1366.63 --> 1373.5600000000002
with it that his story is being used as

1370.2 --> 1377.9
a cover almost to take away some of the

1373.56 --> 1380.1299999999999
weight of what it actually was then well

1377.9 --> 1382.6200000000001
yeah if as long as you're aware of that

1380.13 --> 1386.7800000000002
I don't think you got a big problem you

1382.62 --> 1386.78
won't be led astray subconsciously

1388.42 --> 1391.529
[Music]

1398.81 --> 1407.54
well that's interesting Cleary so could

1404.21 --> 1411.56
it be that Krishna the figure in the

1407.54 --> 1414.3799999999999
history of the Hindu religion that

1411.56 --> 1416.95
Krishna may have been subjected to the

1414.38 --> 1420.95
similar process that he may have been

1416.95 --> 1423.95
yeah celestial eyes just like Christ

1420.95 --> 1426.23
were and hey we know that Jesuits went

1423.95 --> 1429.53
literally all around the world

1426.23 --> 1433.28
God interfered with all the religions

1429.53 --> 1434.87
and we say oh that's specifically to

1433.28 --> 1437.84
cover up Flat Earth right that's what a

1434.87 --> 1439.52
lot of flat earthers said I even kind of

1437.84 --> 1443.84
said it and probably they did they did

1439.52 --> 1448.97
in their own way but I am convinced that

1443.84 --> 1451.31
they also astrologically attuned all the

1448.97 --> 1456.41
religions they all put it into the

1451.31 --> 1459.56
astronomical model to synchronize it all

1456.41 --> 1461.96
and hey at that what what has that done

1459.56 --> 1466.25
what has that done more than anything

1461.96 --> 1468.28
okay and just remember for example the

1466.25 --> 1473.69
original movie what was it again

1468.28 --> 1477.83
zeitgeist what did it do it said look

1473.69 --> 1480.74
it's all just Gnostics because look all

1477.83 --> 1484.4299999999998
these stories are the same so that must

1480.74 --> 1486.11
mean they are individually not real but

1484.43 --> 1487.75
they're actually all just referring to

1486.11 --> 1491.24
the same and we can correlate that

1487.75 --> 1493.25
similarity to the celestial cycle so it

1491.24 --> 1497.99
must all mean the celestial cycle well

1493.25 --> 1500.15
that's exactly why they did it to take

1497.99 --> 1502.82
away from what was originally there

1500.15 --> 1508.19
which was probably very important very

1502.82 --> 1512.24
significant and just synchronize it with

1508.19 --> 1514.3700000000001
the astronomical cycles so that people

1512.24 --> 1516.92
that would look at it objectively would

1514.37 --> 1519.7399999999998
recognize that and then think that it's

1516.92 --> 1525.02
more about the synchronization rather

1519.74 --> 1528.0
than the actual extent any historical

1525.02 --> 1531.81
significance of the characters within

1528.0 --> 1534.81
religion see and that's how they kind of

1531.81 --> 1538.83
partially helped to diffuse it in its

1534.81 --> 1541.95
original foundations in the in the

1538.83 --> 1547.9199999999998
introduction into the wider world that's

1541.95 --> 1551.97
what they did yeah so that's why I

1547.92 --> 1553.92
constantly say it all these religions

1551.97 --> 1555.63
there will probably very real the

1553.92 --> 1559.5800000000002
individuals there were probably very

1555.63 --> 1562.92
powerful spiritually aware individuals

1559.58 --> 1565.05
that had a huge impact on culture and

1562.92 --> 1566.88
the way people thought and how

1565.05 --> 1569.61
everything eventually came into being

1566.88 --> 1572.7900000000002
and started to understand things and

1569.61 --> 1575.04
then the Jesuits came meddled with

1572.79 --> 1577.59
everything and then astrological eyes it

1575.04 --> 1580.98
made it all into astronomically

1577.59 --> 1584.81
synchronized systems and they were

1580.98 --> 1584.81
probably forced to allow that to happen

1585.11 --> 1594.6
they didn't the the Jews who didn't came

1588.3 --> 1597.26
by and just asked no so that's my

1594.6 --> 1597.26
opinion on that

1603.79 --> 1606.93
[Music]

1618.25 --> 1621.39
[Music]

1630.13 --> 1638.47
a GM I don't know where you're getting

1632.35 --> 1640.8999999999999
that from because I don't think that

1638.47 --> 1642.8500000000001
there is literal diet a personification

1640.9 --> 1645.76
with in astrology it's just the

1642.85 --> 1647.74
mechanism it's they are the watch

1645.76 --> 1650.58
readers they are the clock readers

1647.74 --> 1653.169
that's really the mathematical deducing

1650.58 --> 1657.309
system of the globe of the heavens how

1653.169 --> 1659.23
it proceeds the mechanism of it oh all

1657.309 --> 1667.9189999999999
right Randy I'll I'll I'll check it out

1659.23 --> 1667.919
Oh Randy wants to call me sure why not

1671.77 --> 1681.429
[Music]

1675.9 --> 1686.5300000000002
hey hey Randy how's it going yeah it's

1681.429 --> 1688.0300000000002
going good a bit still have to properly

1686.53 --> 1692.5
wake up though although I think it's

1688.03 --> 1695.26
gonna fine because I was up very late it

1692.5 --> 1699.28
was a good show yesterday yeah was was a

1695.26 --> 1701.26
blast it was I mean that who made the

1699.28 --> 1705.3999999999999
introduction for the quantity of racing

1701.26 --> 1707.71
shuttle was it Adam Adam ikan yeah Wow

1705.4 --> 1709.45
pretty a sight isn't it so 3 minute is

1707.71 --> 1712.419
the three minute in trouble it's awesome

1709.45 --> 1716.8300000000002
yeah it feels almost like like in a real

1712.419 --> 1718.5700000000002
movie intro it's all I like to be Fermi

1716.83 --> 1720.1899999999998
that I watched it back again I you know

1718.57 --> 1722.3799999999999
I mean I was part of it obviously

1720.19 --> 1727.0
Oh watching it back as well you get full

1722.38 --> 1729.21
kind of impact of listening to everyone

1727.0 --> 1731.86
going over that sort of content and

1729.21 --> 1733.9
crushing it crushing it everyone had an

1731.86 --> 1736.03
input and everyone was spot-on it was an

1733.9 --> 1740.52
excellent show last night yes it was

1736.03 --> 1743.59
yeah the energy was just so high that I

1740.52 --> 1745.33
it was it was a not expert it was kind

1743.59 --> 1748.1499999999999
of like that the time before that as

1745.33 --> 1751.33
well when when John does live shows then

1748.15 --> 1754.0590000000002
I guess there's this extra expectation

1751.33 --> 1756.07
like it's this is the real stage thing

1754.059 --> 1758.02
we have to do I don't know I got that

1756.07 --> 1760.6299999999999
feeling and when I get that feeling also

1758.02 --> 1763.33
then I figure out like okay this is not

1760.63 --> 1765.73
a time to really goof around

1763.33 --> 1767.619
after like a line a little bit better I

1765.73 --> 1771.369
have to do a little bit better to fall

1767.619 --> 1774.6999999999998
in line not to satisfy anyone's ego but

1771.369 --> 1778.6589999999999
just to get this thing right to use that

1774.7 --> 1780.999
energy well yeah I mean I think we're

1778.659 --> 1783.1000000000001
all sort of figuring it all out now you

1780.999 --> 1784.509
know I mean everyone seems to understand

1783.1 --> 1786.9399999999998
that you know if you over talk each

1784.509 --> 1789.34
other and you you jump in and you you

1786.94 --> 1790.929
know you are gonna lose the the impacts

1789.34 --> 1792.6999999999998
of what we're trying to talk about so

1790.929 --> 1794.259
and people have a feeling for when

1792.7 --> 1796.749
people are speaking and know when to

1794.259 --> 1799.659
she'll talk he hopefully allows the

1796.749 --> 1802.6290000000001
conversation to flow and you know we've

1799.659 --> 1807.509
got better at doing this and it's all

1802.629 --> 1811.509
through teamwork essentially yeah yeah

1807.509 --> 1815.739
and there were so many people on that on

1811.509 --> 1817.8990000000001
that panel how it was a great show we

1815.739 --> 1820.8400000000001
had a great guest I mean Ben tubi of

1817.899 --> 1822.549
conspiracy I mean you know I mean he's

1820.84 --> 1824.32
been on the front line for years it's

1822.549 --> 1826.899
like as all we all start off somewhere

1824.32 --> 1828.97
and we all end up where we are now I

1826.899 --> 1830.889
mean three years ago I when what you

1828.97 --> 1833.019
know now to what you knew three years

1830.889 --> 1837.129
ago is probably completely different

1833.019 --> 1839.169
you're an infinitely better forced to

1837.129 --> 1841.57
Flat Earth than he would have been three

1839.169 --> 1843.0590000000002
years ago the same with everybody you

1841.57 --> 1846.22
know our arguments have evolved

1843.059 --> 1848.4089999999999
researchers different evolved and yeah

1846.22 --> 1851.529
we've got to this place now and we're

1848.409 --> 1854.1090000000002
only just starting to crush it right

1851.529 --> 1857.619
yeah well we've grown a lot of skills

1854.109 --> 1860.139
and that's what I noticed mostly because

1857.619 --> 1863.9499999999998
especially from the start I already had

1860.139 --> 1865.9599999999998
most of these ideas that I now that an

1863.95 --> 1868.989
hour wheeled I I kind of already had

1865.96 --> 1871.359
most of them but I just didn't really

1868.989 --> 1873.279
know what to do with them yet I could

1871.359 --> 1874.9289999999999
just barely translate it and so I just

1873.279 --> 1876.85
put down some rough I did it fall it

1874.929 --> 1880.3590000000002
felt much more like I wasn't inspired

1876.85 --> 1882.2489999999998
artists at the time but yeah during all

1880.359 --> 1884.799
of this time all of the process all the

1882.249 --> 1888.659
things I've tried out I just figured out

1884.799 --> 1891.429
so much more like what is Who am I on

1888.659 --> 1894.519
camera because it is kind of different

1891.429 --> 1897.1000000000001
as as a face to face approach socially

1894.519 --> 1899.08
and figured so much out about myself

1897.1 --> 1902.5
of figured out about how to deal with

1899.08 --> 1905.32
others in this way and learn to deal

1902.5 --> 1907.36
with friendship and friction among among

1905.32 --> 1910.51
one another well we have our own history

1907.36 --> 1914.32
of course and yeah we built all this

1910.51 --> 1916.929
skill and yeah you're right now we can

1914.32 --> 1920.32
do a lot with it it all depends really

1916.929 --> 1923.22
on what what crosses our path and what

1920.32 --> 1926.4099999999999
new directions we can find

1923.22 --> 1928.63
yeah and collaboration on YouTube I mean

1926.41 --> 1931.1200000000001
it's a relatively new thing essentially

1928.63 --> 1932.71
I mean people about 20 years ago you

1931.12 --> 1934.9289999999999
know there wasn't that opportunity for

1932.71 --> 1937.15
people that may have thought the way we

1934.929 --> 1938.789
think to actually just get involved with

1937.15 --> 1941.5
something like this and because of the

1938.789 --> 1943.78
kind of explosion a few years ago on

1941.5 --> 1945.88
flat earth you know and then the

1943.78 --> 1947.6789999999999
resurgence of it again more recently in

1945.88 --> 1949.69
the past three or four years I mean this

1947.679 --> 1951.76
is when it really took hold and people

1949.69 --> 1954.19
have actually latched on to other people

1951.76 --> 1956.08
and be able to carry on their work and

1954.19 --> 1958.69
you know bounce with each other

1956.08 --> 1960.1299999999999
collaborate in real time you know it's

1958.69 --> 1962.6200000000001
something that has never been had

1960.13 --> 1964.659
afforded the opportunity to humankind or

1962.62 --> 1966.76
put till this point which is why we're

1964.659 --> 1968.8300000000002
advancing our arguments as quickly as we

1966.76 --> 1970.87
are you know if it was back in the olden

1968.83 --> 1972.73
days 50 years ago where you had to send

1970.87 --> 1975.3999999999999
a letter to somebody and say I think

1972.73 --> 1977.89
this is an inferior Mirage it was just

1975.4 --> 1979.9
it was it was impossible to do it's not

1977.89 --> 1982.179
like I communicate with you in Amsterdam

1979.9 --> 1984.669
or whatever you know I mean just people

1982.179 --> 1986.44
didn't have the the abilities to do what

1984.669 --> 1988.6000000000001
we're doing right now which is bad

1986.44 --> 1990.52
technology we were able to communicate

1988.6 --> 1992.9499999999998
in real time with each other work

1990.52 --> 1994.24
together and this is why we're crushing

1992.95 --> 1995.95
it this is why our arguments are

1994.24 --> 1997.48
evolving so quickly and the globe has a

1995.95 --> 1999.46
falling behind so fast

1997.48 --> 2002.76
it's because their argument is from the

1999.46 --> 2006.24
1800s and it's never going to win

2002.76 --> 2010.289
because we are crushing it yes we are

2006.24 --> 2013.65
and we're no longer segregated because I

2010.289 --> 2015.6299999999999
think that has been a general tactic

2013.65 --> 2018.0300000000002
that they've used to keep Flat Earth off

2015.63 --> 2020.159
it's not just the conditioning of people

2018.03 --> 2022.86
against it but also the effective social

2020.159 --> 2024.9
result that comes from with it comes

2022.86 --> 2027.809
with it and that is that as soon as you

2024.9 --> 2029.46
are kind of like openly questioning it

2027.809 --> 2032.01
the globe or something

2029.46 --> 2033.419
in the old days you would be segregated

2032.01 --> 2035.279
and you would be made to feel

2033.419 --> 2036.99
specifically like you're an idiot but

2035.279 --> 2040.38
you were also that you would be the only

2036.99 --> 2043.07
one remember and your three-month-old

2040.38 --> 2047.0700000000002
it's early internet that segregation

2043.07 --> 2049.2
sadly was kind of like we've people that

2047.07 --> 2051.21
did it again they realized like wait no

2049.2 --> 2053.22
but there may be more we can look for

2051.21 --> 2057.03
them we can find them and then yeah

2053.22 --> 2059.1899999999996
people kind of found each other by

2057.03 --> 2060.7200000000003
happenstance because the technology was

2059.19 --> 2063.51
now available they couldn't easily

2060.72 --> 2065.73
naturally segregate us anymore because

2063.51 --> 2067.53
you could it's when you when the

2065.73 --> 2069.089
questions were still fresh the idea is

2067.53 --> 2072.8100000000004
the inspiration you could go and find

2069.089 --> 2075.149
others and actually get to talk with

2072.81 --> 2078.24
them and 20 years ago that was a

2075.149 --> 2080.94
nerd-off well yeah I mean whatever you

2078.24 --> 2084.3889999999997
have your secret sources and and just

2080.94 --> 2087.089
communicate for every would wanted to

2084.389 --> 2089.73
keep it a secret and all that for

2087.089 --> 2091.409
everyone flat earther that has a channel

2089.73 --> 2093.78
and he's putting content out right now

2091.409 --> 2095.94
there are 10 that have fallen before the

2093.78 --> 2097.8
attender have come and gone and they

2095.94 --> 2099.2400000000002
were packed wanted out of this this

2097.8 --> 2101.13
argument they were packed committed by

2099.24 --> 2103.14
the globus that would come in descend on

2101.13 --> 2104.55
the channel tell them they were [ __ ]

2103.14 --> 2106.5
tell them who this that and the other

2104.55 --> 2109.23
Doc's them anything they could think of

2106.5 --> 2111.57
to to push them off of youtube and

2109.23 --> 2113.4900000000002
silence their voice so for every single

2111.57 --> 2115.9500000000003
person that's managed to stay the course

2113.49 --> 2118.7999999999997
there was been ten before that had been

2115.95 --> 2121.7999999999997
chased away by these pack-hunting trolls

2118.8 --> 2123.8100000000004
and essentially what we've done as a

2121.8 --> 2126.6600000000003
community that you know those that are

2123.81 --> 2128.2799999999997
still left we still have a very good

2126.66 --> 2131.0989999999997
connection with each other we can rely

2128.28 --> 2134.07
on I could I can call you I could call

2131.099 --> 2135.839
Nathan I could call Bob from Globus it

2134.07 --> 2137.7000000000003
doesn't really matter if I'm in need of

2135.839 --> 2139.74
something and I need to reach out to

2137.7 --> 2142.0499999999997
somebody I've got support there you know

2139.74 --> 2143.7299999999996
in the past that wasn't the case but I

2142.05 --> 2145.17
think what we're doing as a community is

2143.73 --> 2148.56
we're giving that opportunity now to

2145.17 --> 2150.9300000000003
allow people to come to us come to us we

2148.56 --> 2152.19
can help introduce you we can we can we

2150.93 --> 2154.68
can protect you from these trolls

2152.19 --> 2156.66
because now we have the answers you know

2154.68 --> 2158.91
back in the day we knew that we were

2156.66 --> 2160.95
seeing too far and they just told us it

2158.91 --> 2163.3799999999997
was refraction in lumen and all this and

2160.95 --> 2165.99
we were insane yeah but now week

2163.38 --> 2168.63
demonstrate that that is [ __ ] there

2165.99 --> 2170.609
is no it's we have flat water we have

2168.63 --> 2171.329
flat water we see too far it's as simple

2170.609 --> 2173.94
as that

2171.329 --> 2176.279
you know of course the housekeeping

2173.94 --> 2178.799
questions too but it's all the case of

2176.279 --> 2180.809
you know those that came before they

2178.799 --> 2183.329
fell on the sword it led to where we are

2180.809 --> 2185.19
now and we're still where we're at the

2183.329 --> 2186.96
front with keeping this argument going

2185.19 --> 2189.7200000000003
to boot conspiracy is an excellent

2186.96 --> 2192.539
channel I went on a bit of a rampage

2189.72 --> 2198.359
this morning against Ruth if we put a

2192.539 --> 2202.13
video out about him oh sorry in a life

2198.359 --> 2205.23
but I didn't know it was shocking I'm

2202.13 --> 2207.42
for instance right when I first got into

2205.23 --> 2209.67
this this art this whole argument the

2207.42 --> 2211.23
first time I pulled the camera I mean if

2209.67 --> 2214.289
you go back to my early footage I've got

2211.23 --> 2216.65
the camera is tilted at like 45 degrees

2214.289 --> 2219.7200000000003
I can't even hold the camera straight

2216.65 --> 2221.819
even use even using a tripod that's how

2219.72 --> 2224.009
the limit of my technology was an

2221.819 --> 2225.69
abilities back then and what what's

2224.009 --> 2228.93
happened is that you've got real heft

2225.69 --> 2232.079
dragging or very old very very old

2228.93 --> 2233.5789999999997
debunk long debunked video that taboo

2232.079 --> 2235.619
conspiracy put out when he was first

2233.579 --> 2237.9
start enough he went down to a lake he

2235.619 --> 2240.63
did an observation he misidentified a

2237.9 --> 2242.579
building that was it it was as simple as

2240.63 --> 2245.009
that it was on his old channel it was

2242.579 --> 2247.23
from years ago and because he's been

2245.009 --> 2248.91
crushing it recently because he has been

2247.23 --> 2250.71
crushing he's now a globe buster

2248.91 --> 2252.5389999999998
he put on an excellent video out that

2250.71 --> 2254.16
absolutely debunks the globe in every

2252.539 --> 2257.5490000000004
matter of fact we went over it last

2254.16 --> 2261.089
night on ball busters you had everybody

2257.549 --> 2262.829
usual usual eulogizing over it so what's

2261.089 --> 2265.65
their response their responses to go

2262.829 --> 2267.63
back to an incredibly old video that was

2265.65 --> 2269.579
a mistake from two big conspiracies part

2267.63 --> 2271.71
we all do it it's how part of our

2269.579 --> 2274.259
learning curve is how we've got here we

2271.71 --> 2276.42
got here by making mistakes so he made a

2274.259 --> 2279.0
mistake he misidentified a building big

2276.42 --> 2281.759
[ __ ] deal right but Rohit did a 30

2279.0 --> 2284.22
minute [ __ ] video about him titled

2281.759 --> 2286.23
put him in the title as if hey hey

2284.22 --> 2288.8689999999997
nobody needs to listen to [ __ ] - boo

2286.23 --> 2290.43
conspiracy because we can debunk him no

2288.869 --> 2292.17
you can debunk an observation where he

2290.43 --> 2294.359
misidentified the building from years

2292.17 --> 2296.25
ago when he first started but you can't

2294.359 --> 2297.19
you can't go back to his current

2296.25 --> 2299.859
research

2297.19 --> 2302.079
and take that apart now can you know if

2299.859 --> 2304.0
you want such that now now that we have

2302.079 --> 2306.79
the arguments or is all about attacking

2304.0 --> 2308.53
the person discrediting the person going

2306.79 --> 2310.329
back to research that they did yeah is a

2308.53 --> 2312.88
[ __ ] god that doesn't matter has no

2310.329 --> 2314.77
relevance in the current [ __ ] argument

2312.88 --> 2316.54
that we have right now we have a current

2314.77 --> 2319.48
argument we have the winning points and

2316.54 --> 2322.0
they can't handle it Andrew hit can suck

2319.48 --> 2328.15
my dick okay

2322.0 --> 2330.609
not literally okay that's what they're

2328.15 --> 2333.13
all doing now isn't isn't it it's it's

2330.609 --> 2336.04
all character assassination character

2333.13 --> 2338.26
attacks like even as they try to bring

2336.04 --> 2341.319
forward the argument sometimes you know

2338.26 --> 2343.4500000000003
the ballers are still in the background

2341.319 --> 2346.329
in the back of their mind working on an

2343.45 --> 2349.48
angle to try to discredit the person

2346.329 --> 2351.819
they're they're talking with so they're

2349.48 --> 2355.71
not even concerned with their arguments

2351.819 --> 2358.5099999999998
anymore their arguments seem not so much

2355.71 --> 2361.96
research or genuine things it's more

2358.51 --> 2364.9
like toys to them as they're trying to

2361.96 --> 2366.67
accomplish this fast goal of literally

2364.9 --> 2369.64
making everyone believe what they

2366.67 --> 2372.04
believe so it's not even to them so much

2369.64 --> 2374.0789999999997
more about the data about the things

2372.04 --> 2377.38
it's about what they can do with it and

2374.079 --> 2379.2400000000002
that's they don't really care about the

2377.38 --> 2380.8
truth they just don't they just care

2379.24 --> 2383.9799999999996
about everything making everybody

2380.8 --> 2385.7200000000003
believe it's a ball yeah I think I think

2383.98 --> 2387.52
this following year that the next year

2385.72 --> 2390.7599999999998
is going to be an exceptionally good

2387.52 --> 2392.349
year for flyers because okay we have the

2390.76 --> 2394.6600000000003
housekeeping questions that came out at

2392.349 --> 2397.4500000000003
the start of last year but essentially

2394.66 --> 2400.18
we refined the barea found them we've

2397.45 --> 2402.3689999999997
now got a whole more bunch of research

2400.18 --> 2404.71
that has come along this year including

2402.369 --> 2408.19
Shaolin and a shout out in the chat to

2404.71 --> 2411.13
they lay Ohio I heart there they lay

2408.19 --> 2415.18
Ohio who I actually believe is a globe

2411.13 --> 2417.01
earther however yes however he got in

2415.18 --> 2418.96
touch with me on my most recent video

2417.01 --> 2422.0200000000004
from this morning and said that when he

2418.96 --> 2424.96
was in Hawaii the water itself was

2422.02 --> 2426.91
higher in in the bay than he was at the

2424.96 --> 2430.17
shoreline and that was an effect that

2426.91 --> 2432.3599999999997
everybody knows about in the in Hawaii

2430.17 --> 2433.71
it was caused by the shoulding effect

2432.36 --> 2435.03
that I've been talking about you know

2433.71 --> 2437.01
when the waters trying to push up the

2435.03 --> 2438.9
ramp so he actually quote creates an

2437.01 --> 2440.7900000000004
artificial hump so when you get physical

2438.9 --> 2442.7400000000002
blockage of distance stuff that is the

2440.79 --> 2444.42
cause of it so I've been talking about

2442.74 --> 2446.31
this he got in touch and said you know

2444.42 --> 2447.6
why I saw it firsthand you're not even

2446.31 --> 2450.2999999999997
allowed to swim in that area because

2447.6 --> 2451.2
it's a very well-known thing boom thank

2450.3 --> 2453.21
you very much

2451.2 --> 2454.74
now we've even got low Bertha's that are

2453.21 --> 2457.53
looking but the research and thinking

2454.74 --> 2460.77
you know what he has a point I also have

2457.53 --> 2462.36
another point from the distant horizons

2460.77 --> 2463.98
you know and this is from sebou

2462.36 --> 2466.29
conspiracy so we're all getting there

2463.98 --> 2466.92
we're all thinking it out this year's

2466.29 --> 2469.59
gonna be epic

2466.92 --> 2471.81
last year we we made huge progress the

2469.59 --> 2473.4900000000002
following year is gonna be even better

2471.81 --> 2477.45
just hold onto your horses this is going

2473.49 --> 2478.02
to be a ride and a half yeah I bet

2477.45 --> 2481.4399999999996
you're right

2478.02 --> 2484.23
looking forward to it hope to being a

2481.44 --> 2487.92
part of it a little bit more also why I

2484.23 --> 2491.55
do have a p900 now of course thanks to

2487.92 --> 2495.06
you so and I'm really looking forward to

2491.55 --> 2496.8
kind of springtime because I personally

2495.06 --> 2499.08
don't like staying up in the cold I

2496.8 --> 2501.78
don't know how you do it sometimes Randy

2499.08 --> 2504.24
hmm when I look at the weather of the

2501.78 --> 2505.8300000000004
the the shoreline footage it you're when

2504.24 --> 2507.8599999999997
you're doing that and I realized like

2505.83 --> 2510.72
man he's just standing there for like

2507.86 --> 2513.3900000000003
fifteen or thirty minutes maybe even an

2510.72 --> 2516.81
hour in that weather like how do you

2513.39 --> 2518.73
have like ability to withhold the

2516.81 --> 2520.83
weather because I would literally like

2518.73 --> 2522.3
feel really shitty afterwards and that

2520.83 --> 2524.43
kind of cold yes

2522.3 --> 2528.48
now of course I'm I'm kind of skinny so

2524.43 --> 2530.0099999999998
that doesn't really help but I think

2528.48 --> 2531.72
he's more to do with the point it's just

2530.01 --> 2534.0600000000004
it's just a mindset that you get into

2531.72 --> 2535.5
once you once you start chasing the

2534.06 --> 2537.54
research and you and you get the book

2535.5 --> 2540.21
for it you don't really feel the cold

2537.54 --> 2541.32
you feel it you know initially when you

2540.21 --> 2543.12
first go out but then when you actually

2541.32 --> 2545.31
see something and you want to go down

2543.12 --> 2548.3399999999997
and test it out you kind of get excited

2545.31 --> 2550.85
the Blood starts pumping you seem to you

2548.34 --> 2553.44
seem to just be able to push through it

2550.85 --> 2555.54
it's only the walk back then when you've

2553.44 --> 2557.76
walked out a quarter mile out across the

2555.54 --> 2559.68
beach because that's the hardest bit is

2557.76 --> 2561.57
walking back to the car or what have you

2559.68 --> 2563.5499999999997
because that is a long walk across some

2561.57 --> 2565.079
it takes out of your book

2563.55 --> 2566.3390000000004
yeah up until that point when you're

2565.079 --> 2568.319
doing all the research and stuff it's

2566.339 --> 2569.46
real form and then you get to come home

2568.319 --> 2571.44
and you get to look through everything

2569.46 --> 2573.21
and sometimes you disappointed because

2571.44 --> 2575.4900000000002
you actually feel that you actually saw

2573.21 --> 2576.93
something that you didn't and then you

2575.49 --> 2578.609
realize those a bloody inferior Mirage

2576.93 --> 2580.23
there and then it's a case of okay so

2578.609 --> 2583.68
you've got to go and tell people about

2580.23 --> 2586.05
Cynthia mirages again but I feel that

2583.68 --> 2588.8999999999996
you know that sort of work obviously has

2586.05 --> 2590.46
has been a huge progress to you know

2588.9 --> 2592.05
everything that we do everything that we

2590.46 --> 2593.64
do every time that we go out and we do

2592.05 --> 2595.559
stuff when we work together and we come

2593.64 --> 2597.48
up corrupt collaborate with each other

2595.559 --> 2599.6090000000004
we always seem to get an answer we

2597.48 --> 2603.599
always stand Sam seems to find the way

2599.609 --> 2605.64
and you know what you do on your show is

2603.599 --> 2607.8900000000003
you sort of like you you recap things

2605.64 --> 2609.48
that happen maybe the day before which

2607.89 --> 2611.73
it feels good because you know people

2609.48 --> 2613.92
don't often get to hear that you know so

2611.73 --> 2616.619
you'll go and you'll say oh I saw a show

2613.92 --> 2618.51
yesterday on whoever's channel it would

2616.619 --> 2620.4900000000002
have been and you can direct people to

2618.51 --> 2622.98
go and watch that so you always keeping

2620.49 --> 2624.4799999999996
your you know you're always focusing on

2622.98 --> 2627.15
the here and now and keeping up-to-date

2624.48 --> 2628.71
with what people are doing it's it's

2627.15 --> 2631.2000000000003
rare that I check all the channels out

2628.71 --> 2632.64
to be honest right it's rare I'm doing

2631.2 --> 2635.0989999999997
my own sort of research you've got the

2632.64 --> 2637.14
head down all the time but you're always

2635.099 --> 2638.549
focusing on other people too so it's

2637.14 --> 2641.94
great what you do all of your channel

2638.549 --> 2646.44
Thank You Randy I really appreciate it

2641.94 --> 2648.96
yeah I do I do it's kind of funny how it

2646.44 --> 2651.839
worked out for me because I do watch a

2648.96 --> 2654.17
lot of videos in general it is kind of

2651.839 --> 2657.869
what I've been doing I've been doing it

2654.17 --> 2660.42
since the time of Alec Winston's Alex

2657.869 --> 2663.839
Jones Show came to my attention and it

2660.42 --> 2665.4
was still very interesting though and in

2663.839 --> 2669.089
the beginnings and it really got me to

2665.4 --> 2671.52
just watch media watch news watch what

2669.089 --> 2673.319
some people had to say all kinds of

2671.52 --> 2675.809
subjects and it really got me watching

2673.319 --> 2679.92
videos on the internet it's conspiracy

2675.809 --> 2682.049
related and I do that I just do that a

2679.92 --> 2684.2400000000002
lot and originally I thought man I've

2682.049 --> 2685.95
been told you're wasting your time just

2684.24 --> 2688.6189999999997
sitting behind that computer watching

2685.95 --> 2691.5299999999997
stuff all day long well I'm not just

2688.619 --> 2693.96
watching kitty videos you know or the

2691.53 --> 2696.299
funnies you know I do watch some series

2693.96 --> 2697.539
sometimes but it's different but when I

2696.299 --> 2699.279
watch video

2697.539 --> 2701.289
I really watch things that I find

2699.279 --> 2704.739
interesting and I remember it and it is

2701.289 --> 2708.6690000000003
kind of what I do now it is yeah I keep

2704.739 --> 2711.309
track of things from my limited circle

2708.669 --> 2713.229
because I'm not immediate genius you

2711.309 --> 2714.759
know there are there's better people out

2713.229 --> 2717.009
there that do their own thing I do it in

2714.759 --> 2722.679
my own way and I think I'm doing it okay

2717.009 --> 2724.839
and yeah it's good to keep track there's

2722.679 --> 2728.799
so much going on in flat earth and and

2724.839 --> 2733.119
flat earthers do so many things on the

2728.799 --> 2735.069
internet well yeah I mean if you just

2733.119 --> 2737.859
look at the globe logic now the globe

2735.069 --> 2739.299
logic is just so [ __ ] for anybody to

2737.859 --> 2743.889
actually look at it critic you know

2739.299 --> 2745.839
spend an hour with any you know flat

2743.889 --> 2748.569
earther just just you know imagine that

2745.839 --> 2750.189
you just wanted to to look into this and

2748.569 --> 2751.959
you knew somebody that knew the

2750.189 --> 2754.299
arguments on Flat Earth and used to sit

2751.959 --> 2756.399
down with them for an hour and they were

2754.299 --> 2756.88
able to go through the nonsense of the

2756.399 --> 2758.799
globe

2756.88 --> 2761.0190000000002
I guarantee after an hour of somebody

2758.799 --> 2763.029
just listening down and having that that

2761.019 --> 2766.029
conversation with someone that's been

2763.029 --> 2768.309
able to follow these the progression of

2766.029 --> 2770.709
Flat Earth and our arguments you know we

2768.309 --> 2773.409
could turn anybody essentially not the

2770.709 --> 2775.3289999999997
trolls not not the guys in the trolls

2773.409 --> 2777.549
that are here all the time it could be

2775.329 --> 2779.679
just a handful of people that have got a

2777.549 --> 2781.659
million different stock accounts you

2779.679 --> 2783.13
know I mean probably paid operatives

2781.659 --> 2785.7690000000002
that's sitting here all day to make a

2783.13 --> 2787.599
big racket right but your average person

2785.769 --> 2790.479
you know you person down the pub you put

2787.599 --> 2792.1890000000003
you know your friends friend you know

2790.479 --> 2793.419
whoever you know you could just have if

2792.189 --> 2795.0389999999998
somebody wanted to engage in a

2793.419 --> 2797.6189999999997
conversation with you you could

2795.039 --> 2800.529
literally in an hour have them thinking

2797.619 --> 2802.359
so much about how [ __ ] the actual

2800.529 --> 2805.899
globe model is I mean think about it

2802.359 --> 2808.419
spinning a thousand miles an hour right

2805.899 --> 2810.519
right that's and that's one only one

2808.419 --> 2813.189
presupposed motion remember because it's

2810.519 --> 2815.859
also spinning around the Sun and the Sun

2813.189 --> 2818.649
is spinning around a galaxy galaxies are

2815.859 --> 2823.119
spinning around one another everything

2818.649 --> 2829.299
is spinning infinite scale sized ok so

2823.119 --> 2830.67
where's all that motion there's no

2829.299 --> 2833.58
momentum going on there

2830.67 --> 2838.44
no centrifugal forces being subjected to

2833.58 --> 2841.08
us so thank God yeah I know I mean

2838.44 --> 2842.37
wouldn't we here if we were here we here

2841.08 --> 2845.34
we got typical ever got

2842.37 --> 2846.6
Zep tepi in the in the chat and he's one

2845.34 --> 2849.7200000000003
of these guys that I've just mentioned

2846.6 --> 2852.5699999999997
probably one of many little stock

2849.72 --> 2854.1899999999996
accounts from from these paid operatives

2852.57 --> 2856.05
I remember when Muncie said he couldn't

2854.19 --> 2858.03
explain the second celestial Pole and

2856.05 --> 2859.8
how diamond hit was to fly this we don't

2858.03 --> 2861.3900000000003
have to explain everything we don't have

2859.8 --> 2863.4
the answers for everything I'm just

2861.39 --> 2865.44
explaining here and now how the

2863.4 --> 2867.39
connections we've gathered have only

2865.44 --> 2869.2200000000003
been very recently you know it's not

2867.39 --> 2870.81
like we have had thousands of years to

2869.22 --> 2872.43
come up with some kind of [ __ ]

2870.81 --> 2875.7
yeah but I tell you what we are doing

2872.43 --> 2877.83
we're crushing your little globe model

2875.7 --> 2880.2599999999998
we're crushing your idea that you know

2877.83 --> 2881.7599999999998
of looming crushing your ideas that were

2880.26 --> 2884.4900000000002
spinning crushing your ideas that

2881.76 --> 2887.61
there's a vacuum of space out there yeah

2884.49 --> 2889.89
it's only a matter of time Zep tepi you

2887.61 --> 2892.11
know yeah it's only a matter of time

2889.89 --> 2895.3399999999997
yeah you know we're taking everything

2892.11 --> 2898.26
away from you you've got nothing left

2895.34 --> 2900.4500000000003
well let us still have their belief

2898.26 --> 2903.8700000000003
though I think I don't think Zep tepi is

2900.45 --> 2907.08
a troll account though he isn't but

2903.87 --> 2909.87
there's plenty out there I still got the

2907.08 --> 2912.9
the singular troll constantly stalking

2909.87 --> 2915.33
me so yeah but what I'm saying is this

2912.9 --> 2917.25
isn't one guy just Zep tepi

2915.33 --> 2919.11
I mentioned that I mentioned the second

2917.25 --> 2921.48
settle a celestial pole this the

2919.11 --> 2924.48
southern celestial pole I think one time

2921.48 --> 2926.28
in my entire life and it was a long time

2924.48 --> 2927.66
ago it was at least over a year ago when

2926.28 --> 2929.2200000000003
I said that it was pretty dumb in that

2927.66 --> 2930.5699999999997
we couldn't explain it and I remember

2929.22 --> 2932.58
the conversation it was just on one

2930.57 --> 2935.79
particular hangout very what one time

2932.58 --> 2938.0699999999997
that I mentioned it so this Zep tepi has

2935.79 --> 2940.08
an incredibly good memory for somebody

2938.07 --> 2942.57
that is just your average Joe Lea

2940.08 --> 2944.58
somebody that just happened to fall and

2942.57 --> 2947.4
listen to a conversation that I had over

2944.58 --> 2949.23
a year ago and remember it and be able

2947.4 --> 2951.27
to bring it up like that

2949.23 --> 2953.67
Tim attacks the father is just the

2951.27 --> 2956.49
average person sitting in the chair no

2953.67 --> 2958.44
but Randy you underestimate what Bob

2956.49 --> 2961.5
leaves does to the mind

2958.44 --> 2963.18
okay you know there is this thing where

2961.5 --> 2965.52
they literally cannot remember

2963.18 --> 2967.47
an argument or things said even just a

2965.52 --> 2969.39
few seconds ago even if you keep on

2967.47 --> 2972.0299999999997
repeating that right there's like

2969.39 --> 2973.77
seemingly artificial amnesia going on

2972.03 --> 2975.9
but that doesn't mean that their memory

2973.77 --> 2978.809
cannot perfectly function in other ways

2975.9 --> 2981.0
it's just they don't have it so much

2978.809 --> 2983.8390000000004
under control they're there their

2981.0 --> 2986.4
insight is kind of being subjective

2983.839 --> 2988.89
subconsciously to their belief structure

2986.4 --> 2990.9
because it's so important to keep that

2988.89 --> 2993.6299999999997
in line that's what they're really

2990.9 --> 2997.04
focusing on so it's just an entire

2993.63 --> 3000.53
different approach to everything and

2997.04 --> 3003.38
they don't really realize it's you have

3000.53 --> 3006.44
to analyze this behavior very carefully

3003.38 --> 3008.9900000000002
to notice that how selective their

3006.44 --> 3010.79
memory is and what actually makes it

3008.99 --> 3014.3289999999997
function and also that it's not really

3010.79 --> 3017.0589999999997
acted I don't think it is acted I think

3014.329 --> 3020.869
that when they really get this amnesia

3017.059 --> 3024.4700000000003
effect that they just cannot their

3020.869 --> 3026.4500000000003
consciousness is being blocked outside

3024.47 --> 3028.1899999999996
of their will as it were in such a

3026.45 --> 3029.8689999999997
moment so they just can't let it

3028.19 --> 3032.2400000000002
penetrate and they will have to be

3029.869 --> 3035.079
subjected from a martyr perspective of

3032.24 --> 3038.299
oh my god I'm now not succeeding I'll be

3035.079 --> 3040.7000000000003
but I'm doing it for the globe kind of

3038.299 --> 3042.859
thing well one thing I mean he just

3040.7 --> 3045.3999999999996
mentioned there he said you know he

3042.859 --> 3047.66
actually gave me props for being

3045.4 --> 3050.299
intellectually honest right that's what

3047.66 --> 3055.339
he said and what I would say is that I

3050.299 --> 3058.4
will I would be how can I say this I

3055.339 --> 3061.13
think almost every single flattener

3058.4 --> 3063.5
3-seat researcher is intellectually

3061.13 --> 3066.44
honest we're not trained to be deceptive

3063.5 --> 3069.23
in any way we're looking for answers so

3066.44 --> 3071.599
being able to hold our hands up and say

3069.23 --> 3073.13
yeah if this is the case and if this is

3071.599 --> 3075.4100000000003
right and if that's wrong then it is an

3073.13 --> 3077.54
issue for us it's not a big deal for a

3075.41 --> 3079.609
flat earther to be to be like that we

3077.54 --> 3082.609
can afford to do that because we're here

3079.609 --> 3084.68
researching with an open mind and we're

3082.609 --> 3087.38
not being conditioned in any way we've

3084.68 --> 3091.0099999999998
literally got a clean slate where we can

3087.38 --> 3093.1400000000003
make our own findings and try and find

3091.01 --> 3095.059
our own way in this argument whereas the

3093.14 --> 3096.65
globe earth is you're boxed in you've

3095.059 --> 3097.8190000000004
already been told all your info

3096.65 --> 3099.4100000000003
Meishan you've been brainwashed from

3097.819 --> 3100.97
being a kid to say that this is your

3099.41 --> 3103.7
model and this is how everything works

3100.97 --> 3106.4599999999996
and you're not able to be intellectually

3103.7 --> 3108.98
honest you're not able to say okay we

3106.46 --> 3110.539
see this in the distance or the horizon

3108.98 --> 3112.609
is so much further away than it should

3110.539 --> 3115.4300000000003
be on a globe and then you've got it

3112.609 --> 3117.38
going to fall back to this mentality of

3115.43 --> 3119.5989999999997
some kind of looming or refraction

3117.38 --> 3123.289
without it ever being demonstrated to

3119.599 --> 3124.6090000000004
you in this entire ever in this debate

3123.289 --> 3125.96
you've not got a single globe around

3124.609 --> 3128.5099999999998
there that's been able to demonstrate

3125.96 --> 3130.46
this ever there's no scientific proof

3128.51 --> 3131.809
for that there's no scientific proof for

3130.46 --> 3133.279
your spinning globe there's no

3131.809 --> 3134.9300000000003
scientific proof that you can have gas

3133.279 --> 3136.88
pressure without a container there's

3134.93 --> 3138.2
nothing there's literally nothing that

3136.88 --> 3139.549
you have when you break this down

3138.2 --> 3142.279
consistently you're not being

3139.549 --> 3143.63
intellectually honest with yourselves we

3142.279 --> 3147.039
can be intellectually honest with

3143.63 --> 3149.0
ourselves and we will individually take

3147.039 --> 3150.529
one thing at a time

3149.0 --> 3152.39
and break it down and break it down and

3150.529 --> 3153.829
eventually get an answer but you guys

3152.39 --> 3156.319
you you're not coming back with anything

3153.829 --> 3158.8390000000004
you stick into this model this low

3156.319 --> 3160.7
belief and you're not willing to at

3158.839 --> 3163.22
least be intellectually honest on

3160.7 --> 3165.799
anything and that's the difference

3163.22 --> 3168.1699999999996
between us and that's why we get

3165.799 --> 3170.059
frustrated with you guys when we present

3168.17 --> 3172.7000000000003
you with new evidence new findings new

3170.059 --> 3175.6090000000004
research you dismiss it because you have

3172.7 --> 3178.46
this cognitive bias because of what

3175.609 --> 3181.67
you've been told as a child by teachers

3178.46 --> 3183.89
and your adults and in books books that

3181.67 --> 3185.51
were written for the purpose of

3183.89 --> 3188.21
brainwashing you into this globe

3185.51 --> 3190.279
religion but when you actually break it

3188.21 --> 3193.099
down you realize that it can't possibly

3190.279 --> 3194.96
be true but yet you won't fall back and

3193.099 --> 3196.88
at least address that argument you won't

3194.96 --> 3199.549
look at our research you've got this

3196.88 --> 3202.1600000000003
bias and it's very frustrating

3199.549 --> 3210.619
we're intellectually honest yes but you

3202.16 --> 3213.049
guys certainly aren't yeah yeah they to

3210.619 --> 3216.4700000000003
be fair some people especially my chat

3213.049 --> 3218.39
they try to be but yet the only way to

3216.47 --> 3220.73
really do that without giving

3218.39 --> 3225.17
recognition as to the failure of their

3220.73 --> 3227.569
religion to be true yeah they just have

3225.17 --> 3229.64
to stay away and just not address it and

3227.569 --> 3230.24
I've noticed that at least some ballers

3229.64 --> 3232.46
are

3230.24 --> 3234.68
trying their best not to do that na they

3232.46 --> 3237.53
know if they if they can't handle it if

3234.68 --> 3241.19
they're gonna get all rowdy rowdy

3237.53 --> 3243.5600000000004
rallied up then I will eventually time

3241.19 --> 3245.69
them out or ban them but they know now

3243.56 --> 3247.46
it's just like yeah when there is a

3245.69 --> 3250.46
failure in their model and somebody

3247.46 --> 3253.339
points it out and it's right you better

3250.46 --> 3255.29
just shut up because you know it's true

3253.339 --> 3259.339
you don't have to say yes we know it's

3255.29 --> 3262.63
true but yeah just don't start spouts

3259.339 --> 3265.2799999999997
puing nonsense or lies back to try to

3262.63 --> 3268.19
dissuade everyone that it's not true

3265.28 --> 3270.5
because it is there are so many problems

3268.19 --> 3274.27
with the globe model so many things not

3270.5 --> 3278.15
accounted for so many things assumed and

3274.27 --> 3281.63
just overlooked because it isn't a

3278.15 --> 3283.58
complete model like even as the concept

3281.63 --> 3286.25
of a model of what a model is supposed

3283.58 --> 3290.21
to be a representation right well it's

3286.25 --> 3292.79
not a proper model you may think of it

3290.21 --> 3295.9700000000003
as a proper model but it isn't it's

3292.79 --> 3298.64
broken it's incomplete it's not finished

3295.97 --> 3300.2
you could say that's like the best

3298.64 --> 3302.18
designation you could give it's like you

3300.2 --> 3304.2799999999997
know it's unfinished it's like a project

3302.18 --> 3307.04
but they never really refine it all and

3304.28 --> 3309.32
when you try that you figure out why

3307.04 --> 3314.9
because it can't really work because

3309.32 --> 3317.27
it's not true and that doesn't work well

3314.9 --> 3319.4900000000002
the thing we are the only thing we want

3317.27 --> 3322.0099999999998
from the globe is if we were ever having

3319.49 --> 3325.339
debates with them back and forth it's

3322.01 --> 3327.53
for intellectual honesty that's it we

3325.339 --> 3329.54
have the ability to be intellectually

3327.53 --> 3332.03
honest will concede points will admit

3329.54 --> 3333.65
when we round will it's all cases found

3332.03 --> 3335.8390000000004
in the research and working on it I'm

3333.65 --> 3337.67
working on it they never concede

3335.839 --> 3340.46
anything they never want to get into an

3337.67 --> 3342.08
into a proper debate with you or a

3340.46 --> 3345.32
discussion with you and be

3342.08 --> 3346.73
intellectually honest and that's that's

3345.32 --> 3348.619
why I think a lot of flat earthers are

3346.73 --> 3351.83
really frustrated with the current crop

3348.619 --> 3353.6600000000003
of what you would call professional

3351.83 --> 3355.79
globo's let's say let's put it that way

3353.66 --> 3358.5989999999997
of professional trolls are the science

3355.79 --> 3360.67
communicators you mean yeah thing

3358.599 --> 3363.279
there they're rolling out the science

3360.67 --> 3367.509
communicator yeah

3363.279 --> 3372.88
well new it's their new priesthood we

3367.509 --> 3376.119
just one step we just want a discussion

3372.88 --> 3377.9500000000003
you know a logical discussion logical

3376.119 --> 3379.779
that's the dust difference you see we're

3377.95 --> 3383.0789999999997
very logical people and they're very

3379.779 --> 3385.359
logical they believe in fairies in magic

3383.079 --> 3388.1800000000003
and magic dust and that gravity can do

3385.359 --> 3391.18
this and all this kind of fanciful stuff

3388.18 --> 3393.94
can can can happen right we don't this

3391.18 --> 3396.009
on fairies there's more legitimacy to

3393.94 --> 3399.81
fairies than there is to the globe model

3396.009 --> 3401.999
okay hey you don't know what I've seen

3399.81 --> 3404.47
[Laughter]

3401.999 --> 3406.8089999999997
bull Aereo but that doesn't mean that's

3404.47 --> 3407.799
not real but it's at least there's

3406.809 --> 3410.7690000000002
something to it

3407.799 --> 3413.019
so here's the logical here's the logical

3410.769 --> 3414.7889999999998
point right I say to you that you're

3413.019 --> 3417.1899999999996
spinning at a thousand miles an hour and

3414.789 --> 3419.529
I say no I'm stationary I'm not moving

3417.19 --> 3422.4700000000003
right so which one's the most logical

3419.529 --> 3423.819
think about it right are you spinning as

3422.47 --> 3426.9689999999996
a thousand miles an hour

3423.819 --> 3431.499
or are you stationary which one makes

3426.969 --> 3433.539
more sense to you well if you weren't

3431.499 --> 3435.759
told anything if you were told anything

3433.539 --> 3438.369
you just were born today but you could

3435.759 --> 3440.349
speak right and then I said to you are

3438.369 --> 3442.779
you spinning at a thousand miles an hour

3440.349 --> 3445.539
all right you stationary which one would

3442.779 --> 3447.64
it be well the logical person would say

3445.539 --> 3449.1400000000003
hmm I don't feel that I'm spinning I'm

3447.64 --> 3451.8089999999997
actually feel like I'm actually quite

3449.14 --> 3453.069
stationary right but then someone else

3451.809 --> 3454.599
is gonna come along to you and say no

3453.069 --> 3455.859
actually you are spinning at a thousand

3454.599 --> 3456.4790000000003
miles an hour and you're gonna believe

3455.859 --> 3460.18
that

3456.479 --> 3462.7889999999998
right this way and I know how they say

3460.18 --> 3466.479
because it's all relative

3462.789 --> 3469.779
remember mmm that's what they say it's

3466.479 --> 3471.7889999999998
they like kind of very easily forward

3469.779 --> 3474.819
that to Einstein like yeah but is

3471.789 --> 3476.71
relative relativity too because most

3474.819 --> 3478.69
people are not gonna engage in trying to

3476.71 --> 3480.9990000000003
figure that out it's been considered as

3478.69 --> 3483.219
one of the more complicated stuff in

3480.999 --> 3486.3999999999996
society so most people be oh it's

3483.219 --> 3489.609
relative oh okay you know it works

3486.4 --> 3491.469
that's how it worked on me when I then

3489.609 --> 3492.7
you go into Coriolis and you say

3491.469 --> 3497.17
demonstrate car

3492.7 --> 3499.8689999999997
well you can demonstrate the the way in

3497.17 --> 3501.4
which Coriolis should be observed but

3499.869 --> 3503.71
you can't demonstrate it in the real

3501.4 --> 3506.349
world to prove that loosed returning you

3503.71 --> 3508.089
can't do that so the more things that

3506.349 --> 3510.25
you break down with stuff the more time

3508.089 --> 3513.369
that you just ask people to be logical

3510.25 --> 3516.16
as opposed to illogical say to them how

3513.369 --> 3517.81
come you are breathing gas pressure or

3516.16 --> 3519.52
that you surrounded by a gas pressure

3517.81 --> 3522.46
how can we have gas pressure and we have

3519.52 --> 3524.47
a vacuum of space up there you know how

3522.46 --> 3527.92
are those two interacting with each

3524.47 --> 3531.0699999999997
other without a violent interaction you

3527.92 --> 3534.04
know violent which would be the case and

3531.07 --> 3535.42
they say Oh gravity and then you say

3534.04 --> 3536.92
well what's something you can't say

3535.42 --> 3539.079
something you can't prove the bending of

3536.92 --> 3543.099
a conceptual space-time all that

3539.079 --> 3545.23
[ __ ] yeah hmm come on who's the

3543.099 --> 3547.05
logical ones and who's the logical ones

3545.23 --> 3548.68
here

3547.05 --> 3550.8100000000004
we're not trying to be unreasonable

3548.68 --> 3552.91
we're just asking for a debate here a

3550.81 --> 3554.47
proper argument you bring your proofs

3552.91 --> 3557.17
but you don't have any proofs you've got

3554.47 --> 3558.43
no scientific proofs you don't have them

3557.17 --> 3561.099
that's why we're asking for them but you

3558.43 --> 3567.27
don't go home you've got a fairy tale

3561.099 --> 3571.329
were you gonna proof yeah that's true

3567.27 --> 3573.93
indeed and hey I've been very open like

3571.329 --> 3577.329
oh you wanna discuss gas pressure

3573.93 --> 3581.109
next to a container Oh gravity you say

3577.329 --> 3583.2400000000002
okay well when was it like two days ago

3581.109 --> 3587.71
I did a piece told about it like the

3583.24 --> 3590.74
four steps in in how impossible gas

3587.71 --> 3594.069
pressure next to a vacuum of space on

3590.74 --> 3596.2
the earth is and there's like four steps

3594.069 --> 3598.5099999999998
it's like no matter what you presuppose

3596.2 --> 3601.4199999999996
it's always gonna turn to be absolutely

3598.51 --> 3604.48
impossible because even if you do assume

3601.42 --> 3607.06
that gravity is a force then that force

3604.48 --> 3609.13
as presumed it should function is a weak

3607.06 --> 3611.619
force and it cannot contract the gas

3609.13 --> 3614.29
pressure expansion in the container

3611.619 --> 3616.48
force which is considered entropy and is

3614.29 --> 3620.02
a strong for so it can't counteract each

3616.48 --> 3623.89
other over time it's asymmetrical from

3620.02 --> 3626.74
their own systems and if you then start

3623.89 --> 3628.42
to assume well wait maybe gravity

3626.74 --> 3630.7
some just misunderstood we just don't

3628.42 --> 3633.01
understand it it can do that right well

3630.7 --> 3635.02
then you got the issue oh but wait the

3633.01 --> 3637.71
entire presupposed container of the

3635.02 --> 3640.18
outer space universe is also supposedly

3637.71 --> 3642.52
expanding the redshift remember that

3640.18 --> 3643.96
presupposition redshift it's expanding

3642.52 --> 3647.65
well that means that the volume is

3643.96 --> 3649.42
increasing and therefore all the gas all

3647.65 --> 3651.9100000000003
of it no matter where it is no matter

3649.42 --> 3655.869
what forces it is being subjected to are

3651.91 --> 3658.0
going to volumetrically expand despite

3655.869 --> 3660.01
all forces being subjected to them so

3658.0 --> 3663.01
even if gravity was a force and that

3660.01 --> 3665.23
force would mysteriously be sufficient

3663.01 --> 3666.13
to keep that gas pressure on that ball

3665.23 --> 3667.96
in that fashion

3666.13 --> 3670.81
well the universe would still be

3667.96 --> 3672.4900000000002
expanding counteracting that gravity

3670.81 --> 3674.95
force to keep that gas on the ball and

3672.49 --> 3678.3999999999996
it would still escape over time maybe

3674.95 --> 3680.56
not as fast but it would so there's

3678.4 --> 3684.85
there's a slight problem with the

3680.56 --> 3686.67
concept know what I mean well isn't even

3684.85 --> 3689.68
big one how did how did the first

3686.67 --> 3691.51
particles of gas actually just adir to

3689.68 --> 3694.5699999999997
the to the rock that was the earth in

3691.51 --> 3696.3300000000004
its quote-unquote formation you know how

3694.57 --> 3699.1000000000004
was that even possible

3696.33 --> 3701.89
it's a hole in space you know it's a

3699.1 --> 3704.2
hole it just goes off and then yeah

3701.89 --> 3706.69
first yeah

3704.2 --> 3709.8689999999997
to be fair I can conceptualize it's all

3706.69 --> 3712.33
mechanical and fictional it's conceptual

3709.869 --> 3714.55
but hey if there is holes in space like

3712.33 --> 3718.96
Einstein would say then yeah things

3714.55 --> 3720.73
would like go in there and eventually

3718.96 --> 3722.26
the more heavy the more dense would end

3720.73 --> 3724.359
up at the bottom and the less dense

3722.26 --> 3727.15
would end up and top including the gas

3724.359 --> 3728.95
that is how it would be seen it it's

3727.15 --> 3731.17
like the universe would be a flat

3728.95 --> 3733.8399999999997
surface and there would be holes in

3731.17 --> 3736.6
there and in those holes the the heavier

3733.84 --> 3740.8
matter gathers that's kind of how it

3736.6 --> 3744.64
would work but yeah none of that really

3740.8 --> 3747.46
helps the gas pressure from just staying

3744.64 --> 3749.56
on top of that that top layer where the

3747.46 --> 3754.18
holes are not there and just spreading

3749.56 --> 3757.5099999999998
out full out funny isn't it

3754.18 --> 3759.72
it just didn't work not even Einstein in

3757.51 --> 3763.8590000000004
gravity hole bending

3759.72 --> 3765.6899999999996
of space can really counteract the the

3763.859 --> 3770.7
practical effects of gas pressure

3765.69 --> 3773.28
expansion not really I mean to be honest

3770.7 --> 3777.96
I mean that the globe bottle has failed

3773.28 --> 3780.9
miserably upholding the the the concept

3777.96 --> 3783.29
of it it's failed so poorly for just a

3780.9 --> 3785.76
few people that have done some research

3783.29 --> 3791.46
working as a community together on

3785.76 --> 3794.07
YouTube much you know for people once

3791.46 --> 3796.109
they step outside that box of the

3794.07 --> 3797.9700000000003
indoctrination it doesn't take long for

3796.109 --> 3800.609
people to actually look at the the

3797.97 --> 3803.3689999999997
nonsense of it you know and how it fails

3800.609 --> 3805.29
how it can't possibly work you know it

3803.369 --> 3806.849
doesn't take people very long to

3805.29 --> 3808.74
understand that they've been brainwashed

3806.849 --> 3812.2200000000003
into believing something that isn't true

3808.74 --> 3813.5989999999997
you know and you know I'm not saying

3812.22 --> 3815.7599999999998
that we're the most intelligent people

3813.599 --> 3818.07
in the world but we just dedicated

3815.76 --> 3822.0200000000004
people into looking into this yeah and

3818.07 --> 3824.849
you know we don't need to have a science

3822.02 --> 3827.19
acumen to actually disprove their

3824.849 --> 3830.1600000000003
[ __ ] we don't need that they just

3827.19 --> 3835.369
have mathematics mathematics isn't

3830.16 --> 3837.48
reality you know reality is reality

3835.369 --> 3840.15
alright if you don't use your

3837.48 --> 3842.369
mathematics to build upon reality then

3840.15 --> 3845.849
it's just all gonna go adrift you're not

3842.369 --> 3848.3
gonna be touching down anywhere other

3845.849 --> 3850.53
than we can speak for yourself Renzi

3848.3 --> 3852.119
well do you have a deal of letters after

3850.53 --> 3855.27
my name I do have a degree but I don't

3852.119 --> 3855.599
have a degree in science Adam does

3855.27 --> 3859.08
though

3855.599 --> 3861.3590000000004
Adams quite the guy it scales with it

3859.08 --> 3864.5699999999997
Adam why do you join the panel yeah why

3861.359 --> 3869.22
not if you want yeah and ask to speak to

3864.57 --> 3871.0800000000004
you actually yeah I mean yeah we're just

3869.22 --> 3873.81
crushing it now what guys we're just

3871.08 --> 3875.64
crushing it it's it's gone a little bit

3873.81 --> 3877.56
stale because the globe is not fighting

3875.64 --> 3878.97
back really in fact the only thing be

3877.56 --> 3882.2999999999997
fighting back is against the person

3878.97 --> 3884.43
rather than the argument and yeah this

3882.3 --> 3886.8590000000004
is why when they keep saying Flat Earth

3884.43 --> 3889.77
is losing no Flat Earth is winning it's

3886.859 --> 3891.91
just that the the raging arguments that

3889.77 --> 3893.23
used to be in the past the the

3891.91 --> 3896.109
hundreds of videos that used to be out

3893.23 --> 3900.4
every single day isn't the case anymore

3896.109 --> 3903.339
because the globus can't respond he

3900.4 --> 3904.42
can't make videos against this and

3903.339 --> 3906.49
against that and against the other

3904.42 --> 3908.829
because we're smarter now we've learned

3906.49 --> 3911.3489999999997
how to navigate their their pitfalls

3908.829 --> 3913.809
their traps their arguments and crush

3911.349 --> 3916.809
them and so they're not coming back with

3913.809 --> 3919.27
videos against doors you know they can't

3916.809 --> 3923.4100000000003
do it the arguments gone stale because

3919.27 --> 3926.2599999999998
of them indeed yeah Adam said yeah you

3923.41 --> 3945.0589999999997
could join the pool for half an hour so

3926.26 --> 3945.059
that's awesome afternoon guys hey

3945.39 --> 3952.299
welcome on the early bird show though

3949.42 --> 3956.4
our morning everyone in chat as well

3952.299 --> 3959.88
Sarah later yeah you're right guys it's

3956.4 --> 3962.98
it's not become stale as it's become

3959.88 --> 3966.25
predictable it's almost at the point on

3962.98 --> 3969.039
the debates where they will start at

3966.25 --> 3970.779
that point and we can pretty much not

3969.039 --> 3972.279
finish their point but show where they

3970.779 --> 3974.71
long piscator because they can't finish

3972.279 --> 3977.559
a point anymore you can't take it to its

3974.71 --> 3980.289
scientific or validated conclusions

3977.559 --> 3983.1400000000003
because we've on picked it so all that's

3980.289 --> 3986.5890000000004
left for them is to try and tell me that

3983.14 --> 3989.14
a shoe is a phenomena you know it is a

3986.589 --> 3991.0
complete slaughter right now I mean it

3989.14 --> 3992.65
back in the butt when I first started

3991.0 --> 3995.109
off I mean you had people like does it

3992.65 --> 3997.329
the cameraman and whoever else you know

3995.109 --> 3998.89
debunking our stuff which was fine you

3997.329 --> 4001.1090000000004
know because we would just learn in you

3998.89 --> 4004.049
know they've gone quiet now I mean it

4001.109 --> 4006.45
used to be the case that you'd have ten

4004.049 --> 4008.73
globe trolls to one flat earther and

4006.45 --> 4011.359
they would sort of like descend on your

4008.73 --> 4015.66
channel rip hear of your argument apart

4011.359 --> 4017.7599999999998
and now it's still the way around you

4015.66 --> 4019.3799999999997
know now we have the arguments now and

4017.76 --> 4022.619
they're not playing ball they've gone

4019.38 --> 4025.63
into like a little shell and and hidden

4022.619 --> 4028.6600000000003
away on the wrong little side of the

4025.63 --> 4029.92
of the pond let's say and and they don't

4028.66 --> 4032.47
want to come over and play with us

4029.92 --> 4034.089
anymore you know yeah I got something to

4032.47 --> 4036.069
say about about that yeah you're totally

4034.089 --> 4038.98
right because I still remember in the

4036.069 --> 4041.89
time when ballers would be so confident

4038.98 --> 4043.329
about being the winner and all that that

4041.89 --> 4046.0
they would be like oh yeah they're don't

4043.329 --> 4047.799
they're afraid they don't want us

4046.0 --> 4050.259
yeah there you stay away from us because

4047.799 --> 4052.809
they don't want to argue with us face to

4050.259 --> 4055.66
face and all that and now it's indeed

4052.809 --> 4058.69
more like they're just getting complainy

4055.66 --> 4061.47
in our within our presence so it's more

4058.69 --> 4062.98
like yeah why don't they just stop

4061.47 --> 4071.3999999999996
getting in our way

4062.98 --> 4075.009
oh damn I'm Friday's IRM show we had

4071.4 --> 4076.599
Jose in a chat for a little bit and I'll

4075.009 --> 4077.98
just just talk to him and one of the

4076.599 --> 4081.7000000000003
questions he was asking me you know why

4077.98 --> 4084.4900000000002
don't flutter this' come on the ballers

4081.7 --> 4088.509
show and engage in conversation and and

4084.49 --> 4091.2099999999996
genuine my response and and knows a fair

4088.509 --> 4094.329
play to a point no daddy said you know

4091.21 --> 4096.46
was my point was from what is the point

4094.329 --> 4097.9890000000005
what is the point in turning up to

4096.46 --> 4099.969
engage in a conversation as you say

4097.989 --> 4102.638999999999
around here is intellectually not honest

4099.969 --> 4104.7390000000005
you you get to a point that would allow

4102.639 --> 4107.799
you to progress if here that's accepted

4104.739 --> 4109.69
in mainstream science whatever you know

4107.799 --> 4112.839
but they won't even accept that because

4109.69 --> 4114.549
it does destroy their paradigm so you

4112.839 --> 4116.199
can't actually have this conversation

4114.549 --> 4118.69
and that's that's the point I was making

4116.199 --> 4119.949
to Jose's ease ease know that he's

4118.69 --> 4122.0199999999995
noticed that there aren't many fighters

4119.949 --> 4123.669999999999
bothering to go there there's a few

4122.02 --> 4125.620000000001
hardcore ones and they're having a no

4123.67 --> 4127.719
Travis and the likes well actually it's

4125.62 --> 4130.17
not attractive to us not because we're

4127.719 --> 4132.609
scared without all the areas have been

4130.17 --> 4133.839
scared of losing in a hajiman with them

4132.609 --> 4136.359
there's not an argument that can win

4133.839 --> 4137.38
it's because it's the futility and

4136.359 --> 4139.150000000001
you're not actually gonna have a

4137.38 --> 4141.58
discussion you're gonna spend hours

4139.15 --> 4143.44
batting around like I said whether a

4141.58 --> 4147.5199999999995
shoes a phenomena or whatever you know I

4143.44 --> 4150.849999999999
mean all the nonsense redefining a word

4147.52 --> 4152.889
you know it's a non Socratic debate is

4150.85 --> 4157.5
the best they've got isn't it yeah I

4152.889 --> 4159.13
mean it's like the rumpus fires level

4157.5 --> 4163.739
level is

4159.13 --> 4167.71
level is curved yeah and also means or

4163.739 --> 4169.69
remember that I'm like make your mind up

4167.71 --> 4170.9800000000005
so what you're trying to say now was and

4169.69 --> 4174.159
then I actually pinned him down to a

4170.98 --> 4175.329
point and I said so across this massive

4174.159 --> 4178.0
ocean of water

4175.329 --> 4179.38
it's flies it he said yeah so I said

4178.0 --> 4184.509
should we've got flat water he said yeah

4179.38 --> 4187.029
you got flat water ok it's like they're

4184.509 --> 4190.719
two completely redefining the terms of

4187.029 --> 4192.219
what flat level actually means and that

4190.719 --> 4198.07
was all down to the Salt Lake's

4192.219 --> 4200.38
that the Bolivian salt flats and you

4198.07 --> 4202.719
know you have a territory there that's

4200.38 --> 4204.34
known to be flat in fact if you look at

4202.719 --> 4206.199
some of the videos because I've actually

4204.34 --> 4209.05
been watching some of these tour videos

4206.199 --> 4211.65
that the people go on tour there and you

4209.05 --> 4214.119000000001
have some of the guys that do all the

4211.65 --> 4217.388999999999
driving around and taking them to these

4214.119 --> 4220.089999999999
locations and stuff and the speaking on

4217.389 --> 4221.92
camera saying how how flat it is and how

4220.09 --> 4223.929
far you can actually see and the reason

4221.92 --> 4225.429
you can see as far as you can and you

4223.929 --> 4227.8
actually think it's nearer than it is

4225.429 --> 4230.71
it's because it's so far away because

4227.8 --> 4232.389
it's so flat so even the people the tour

4230.71 --> 4234.82
guides in the location know that the

4232.389 --> 4236.11
area is completely flat but then you've

4234.82 --> 4237.75
got the glow birds that are trying to

4236.11 --> 4241.15
twist this and say well no it's not

4237.75 --> 4243.219
because if it was flat then that would

4241.15 --> 4245.049999999999
go against their model even though it's

4243.219 --> 4247.36
known to be the flattest surface on

4245.05 --> 4249.04
earth right even though the people that

4247.36 --> 4251.5
live there know that it's flat as a

4249.04 --> 4254.8
pancake yet the globe is will still try

4251.5 --> 4257.8
and try to argue that it's not because

4254.8 --> 4259.51
it would crush their their worldview and

4257.8 --> 4261.099
the reason it would crush their

4259.51 --> 4263.889
worldview especially in the Bolivian

4261.099 --> 4267.219
salt salt flats is that within the rainy

4263.889 --> 4269.5
season the entire area is covered in

4267.219 --> 4271.63
around about knee-deep water that's why

4269.5 --> 4273.489
you get these beautiful reflections now

4271.63 --> 4274.6900000000005
if that was the case and I think I

4273.489 --> 4278.829
worked it out there was almost like a

4274.69 --> 4280.839999999999
hundred million cubic liters or

4278.829 --> 4283.299999999999
something of water all for that entire

4280.84 --> 4285.79
area well if it was the shape of the

4283.3 --> 4288.55
globe you know then that water would

4285.79 --> 4291.159
pool look in the middle it would have to

4288.55 --> 4292.570000000001
conform to the shape of the earth so I

4291.159 --> 4292.839999999999
cross that flat surface she couldn't

4292.57 --> 4295.84
have

4292.84 --> 4298.599
flat surface you couldn't have just knee

4295.84 --> 4300.6990000000005
knee height the whole way over 50 square

4298.599 --> 4302.53
miles you couldn't have it you know it

4300.699 --> 4306.669999999999
would have to be it would have to be

4302.53 --> 4310.69
cooling due to gravity then rhombuses

4306.67 --> 4312.88
world flat across those salt flats isn't

4310.69 --> 4315.54
flat flat falls off at a rate of 8

4312.88 --> 4319.21
inches per mile squared and that was the

4315.54 --> 4321.25
nonsense I listen to him Babylon for

4319.21 --> 4323.77
hours with you was trying to just

4321.25 --> 4325.69
confuse people to accept that there'd

4323.77 --> 4328.900000000001
ball a dictionary definition of flat

4325.69 --> 4331.36
means curving a rate of our but that

4328.9 --> 4332.589999999999
doesn't mean that those salt flats are

4331.36 --> 4335.259999999999
curving at the rate of our and they're

4332.59 --> 4336.969
not they're flat yeah the contradiction

4335.26 --> 4339.34
he just trying to confuse wasn't he and

4336.969 --> 4341.92
and and that's that's the whole point

4339.34 --> 4343.75
it's that frustration that actually you

4341.92 --> 4345.52
know he's not even gonna concede that so

4343.75 --> 4347.219
that you can have a grown-up

4345.52 --> 4350.369000000001
conversation he's just gonna try and

4347.219 --> 4353.38
confuse and twist and perverse so that

4350.369 --> 4354.848999999999
you've always be doing and you just have

4353.38 --> 4357.84
to sod off daily because it's just

4354.849 --> 4361.27
hideous the flesh the flattest place

4357.84 --> 4363.52
known to humans known to humankind the

4361.27 --> 4366.1900000000005
flattest place measured on the earth

4363.52 --> 4370.6900000000005
the Bolivian salt flats isn't flat in

4366.19 --> 4373.598999999999
the rhombuses mind hmm well I think it

4370.69 --> 4376.239
is especially because that location has

4373.599 --> 4382.21
been used specifically because it is so

4376.239 --> 4386.259999999999
flat for when is it super fast the wheel

4382.21 --> 4388.75
drink a lot speed records well if it's

4386.26 --> 4392.38
not gonna be perfectly flat there's

4388.75 --> 4394.929
gonna be a problem with super high speed

4392.38 --> 4398.28
vehicles you look it's not just a thing

4394.929 --> 4403.15
going very fast now it's going very fast

4398.28 --> 4405.73
leaning upon this this surface so any

4403.15 --> 4409.509999999999
kind of deviation is going to get

4405.73 --> 4413.5599999999995
massive repercussions that's why it is

4409.51 --> 4415.179
so perfectly flat or well he proven and

4413.56 --> 4417.070000000001
he's come back with well it's all to do

4415.179 --> 4418.9
with the elevation the elevation to say

4417.07 --> 4422.409
is that it's the same elevation from

4418.9 --> 4424.54
point a B C and D then he says an

4422.409 --> 4425.629999999999
elevation is measured from the center of

4424.54 --> 4428.15
the earth and the neighboring

4425.63 --> 4430.43
that says that elevation is not to be

4428.15 --> 4437.389999999999
confused with the distance from the

4430.43 --> 4440.12
center of the earth yeah and it's like I

4437.39 --> 4442.9400000000005
literally have a citation up right now

4440.12 --> 4444.38
and you're telling me the elevation is

4442.94 --> 4447.98
measured from the distance in the center

4444.38 --> 4450.59
of the earth and I'm like dude this is

4447.98 --> 4451.58
this is the Congress if this is what

4450.59 --> 4453.83
they were talking about intellectual

4451.58 --> 4456.44
honesty and Adam you hit it on the head

4453.83 --> 4459.71
that there is the point it's got to the

4456.44 --> 4461.87
point where you just feel so frustrated

4459.71 --> 4463.88
that you just can't have an intellectual

4461.87 --> 4465.89
discussion with these guys you know you

4463.88 --> 4468.26
just want them to be honest and they

4465.89 --> 4472.75
can't do that their bias won't allow

4468.26 --> 4475.37
them to to dwell away from the from the

4472.75 --> 4477.02
narratives that they've been told in any

4475.37 --> 4480.32
way shape or form they won't concede a

4477.02 --> 4482.780000000001
single point ever right because that's

4480.32 --> 4486.65
the part of the game especially that

4482.78 --> 4489.74
rumpus likes to play he loves being a

4486.65 --> 4493.099999999999
spin doctor and it's weird because I

4489.74 --> 4495.7699999999995
know he does it and I kind of enjoy

4493.1 --> 4499.370000000001
listening to his spinning around because

4495.77 --> 4502.64
I just can feel behind it like how much

4499.37 --> 4505.49
he wants to manipulate people in to

4502.64 --> 4508.52
going with it it is I can sense that

4505.49 --> 4510.59
from him and I don't know for some weird

4508.52 --> 4513.01
reason I just find it hilarious and

4510.59 --> 4516.89
funny that he's so genuinely passionate

4513.01 --> 4521.530000000001
that manipulate people this haven't you

4516.89 --> 4524.360000000001
know he really genuinely enjoys it

4521.53 --> 4526.73
that's a level one my mate was is

4524.36 --> 4530.0
another good example where you're not

4526.73 --> 4533.419999999999
able to progress with them because okay

4530.0 --> 4534.88
for part of his narrative flat was sea

4533.42 --> 4537.68
level and a yachtie

4534.88 --> 4539.78
related to distance from the center of

4537.68 --> 4541.79
the earth which was if he wants to

4539.78 --> 4544.37
define it like that that's fine in their

4541.79 --> 4546.71
ball model but if you then take the

4544.37 --> 4549.08
accepted data from them in their ball

4546.71 --> 4551.09
model and there's the huge contradiction

4549.08 --> 4553.04
if you are going to use distance from

4551.09 --> 4556.1900000000005
the center of the earth because Earth's

4553.04 --> 4559.07
an oblate spheroid there is a 13-mile

4556.19 --> 4561.83
difference between a polar

4559.07 --> 4565.19
an equatorial radius so are you saying

4561.83 --> 4568.85
that when he says sea level is zero that

4565.19 --> 4570.889999999999
that's 13 kilometers yeah higher that

4568.85 --> 4574.76
the pulse of the sea level would have to

4570.89 --> 4578.110000000001
be 13 miles higher at the poles to be

4574.76 --> 4581.780000000001
the same zero as the zero at the equator

4578.11 --> 4583.61
now that's their data again rumpus won't

4581.78 --> 4586.37
accept that and wouldn't then deal with

4583.61 --> 4588.3099999999995
that and the consequences of saying it's

4586.37 --> 4590.989
from the center of the earth but also

4588.31 --> 4593.21
the contradiction that you've got two

4590.989 --> 4598.73
different radiuses or multiple different

4593.21 --> 4600.77
races radiuses on an oblate spheroid so

4598.73 --> 4603.259999999999
there's a straight contradiction in his

4600.77 --> 4605.360000000001
model there as to how he defines celo

4603.26 --> 4607.610000000001
and I say you wouldn't even get past

4605.36 --> 4609.08
that bit you just go back to going no

4607.61 --> 4610.429999999999
roots flat because it's the same

4609.08 --> 4612.68
distance from some of the effort and

4610.43 --> 4615.110000000001
then ignore the point within his own

4612.68 --> 4616.58
model of contradiction which is I say

4615.11 --> 4619.07
the frustration it does give you a

4616.58 --> 4621.55
tingle all important yes it does it does

4619.07 --> 4624.32
it does give a lot of giggles for me

4621.55 --> 4625.9400000000005
well here's that here's the is in other

4624.32 --> 4627.71
things to think about them to consider

4625.94 --> 4630.889999999999
that these Globes they're always saying

4627.71 --> 4633.86
that we don't have any proof well lake

4630.89 --> 4635.54
pontchartrain bridge right when they DS

4633.86 --> 4638.83
it when they made the designs for that

4635.54 --> 4641.6
and when they built it they included

4638.83 --> 4644.54
four earth curvature they included for

4641.6 --> 4647.27
it the the problem is and this is this

4644.54 --> 4651.8
is documented by the way the problem is

4647.27 --> 4654.9800000000005
that it's 24 miles across this this

4651.8 --> 4658.820000000001
globe earth right 24 miles which means

4654.98 --> 4662.259999999999
that there would be a drop of 384 feet

4658.82 --> 4664.5199999999995
so that's 384 feet of additional

4662.26 --> 4667.91
materials that they would needed to have

4664.52 --> 4670.67
included in the bridge design to

4667.91 --> 4672.2
actually complete it to get across from

4670.67 --> 4673.88
one sides of the other because that

4672.2 --> 4674.95
would be the extra distance that it

4673.88 --> 4677.87
would travel

4674.95 --> 4680.33
unfortunately included in their

4677.87 --> 4683.18
calculations they just included two

4680.33 --> 4685.21
inches for Earth curve two inches and

4683.18 --> 4687.83
you know what the bridge was built

4685.21 --> 4690.89
absolutely perfect absolutely fine

4687.83 --> 4692.66
without any additional costs for any

4690.89 --> 4695.75
extra materials so they

4692.66 --> 4697.79
were able to complete that design

4695.75 --> 4701.18
complete that bridge with just two

4697.79 --> 4703.25
inches of extra length included for the

4701.18 --> 4707.8
the curvature of the earth when in

4703.25 --> 4717.95
actual fact they needed 384 feet

4707.8 --> 4720.2
now that's proven more fascinating you

4717.95 --> 4722.42
know I mean it doesn't come any better

4720.2 --> 4725.99
than that I mean two inches they allowed

4722.42 --> 4728.3
for two inches but yeah hello I think

4725.99 --> 4731.24
the the the with the council or whoever

4728.3 --> 4733.67
was in charge of actually paying for the

4731.24 --> 4736.21
materials and labor and and stuff like

4733.67 --> 4739.91
that when if they had to find an extra

4736.21 --> 4742.07
384 feet of material and labor and costs

4739.91 --> 4743.75
I think that if had something to say if

4742.07 --> 4746.9
the architects and designers got it

4743.75 --> 4750.47
incorrect yeah you're absolutely right a

4746.9 --> 4754.61
I've said I'm pretty damn sure that all

4750.47 --> 4757.22
architects kind of know it's flat they

4754.61 --> 4761.089999999999
have to because nothing would work if

4757.22 --> 4765.530000000001
they got it wrong and a there they're

4761.09 --> 4766.88
the 3d programs that they gladly utilize

4765.53 --> 4770.0
these days for what they do

4766.88 --> 4773.6900000000005
yeah they're all simulating flat flat

4770.0 --> 4777.28
spaces so yeah it is flat the earth

4773.69 --> 4780.5599999999995
really is flat no matter how much DBT

4777.28 --> 4782.9
the media loves to shop that ball in our

4780.56 --> 4784.55
faces yeah I mean we're not making this

4782.9 --> 4788.299999999999
stuff up you know it's not it's not

4784.55 --> 4789.74
making me happy to think oh yeah we're

4788.3 --> 4791.570000000001
not we're not spinning anymore we can't

4789.74 --> 4792.92
go to space we can't get in a spaceship

4791.57 --> 4795.139999999999
in a few hundred years time or my

4792.92 --> 4797.66
great-great grandchildren can't jump in

4795.14 --> 4801.26
a a spacecraft and go off in an and

4797.66 --> 4802.82
visit distant you know galaxies and

4801.26 --> 4805.25
stuff like that the idea of is so

4802.82 --> 4808.13
fantastical it hurts me that we've lost

4805.25 --> 4809.87
that in some ways you know it does it

4808.13 --> 4811.51
hurts that you've actually lost that so

4809.87 --> 4813.86
it's not like I'm over the moon

4811.51 --> 4815.99
understanding that the earth is flat but

4813.86 --> 4817.639999999999
then you obviously you get a different

4815.99 --> 4819.65
perspective on things you realize that

4817.64 --> 4820.910000000001
you've lost that okay but then you gain

4819.65 --> 4821.57
something else which we must have a

4820.91 --> 4823.79
creator

4821.57 --> 4825.9
maybe there's additional land who knows

4823.79 --> 4828.0
maybe the exploration hasn't been

4825.9 --> 4829.5599999999995
you know I mean there's a whole reason

4828.0 --> 4831.21
as to why as it's being kept from us

4829.56 --> 4834.030000000001
than what is there what else is there

4831.21 --> 4835.83
you know so we've lost one thing but

4834.03 --> 4837.63
we've gained and in other way yeah I

4835.83 --> 4839.429
wanna do we're not doing this for the

4837.63 --> 4842.01
you know we're not here just to beat rot

4839.429 --> 4842.429
we're not trolling the people of the

4842.01 --> 4844.08
world

4842.429 --> 4845.909
we're not trolling people for that you

4844.08 --> 4847.8
know we're not we're going out over

4845.909 --> 4849.929
actually putting ourselves out there and

4847.8 --> 4852.09
doing research and you know we're not

4849.929 --> 4853.35
just we're not just talking about this

4852.09 --> 4854.55
[ __ ] we're actually trying to figure

4853.35 --> 4856.79
things out and we're finding out that

4854.55 --> 4859.14
the globe model doesn't stand up and

4856.79 --> 4861.659
there's a far more evidence for it being

4859.14 --> 4863.79
flat than it is for being a globe you

4861.659 --> 4866.3099999999995
know how is that so difficult for people

4863.79 --> 4868.17
to understand or to even just appreciate

4866.31 --> 4870.39
that we're just not we're not doing this

4868.17 --> 4873.3
for the good of our healthier you know

4870.39 --> 4875.159000000001
we're actually it impacts us a lot in

4873.3 --> 4877.77
the real world you know it has a

4875.159 --> 4879.599999999999
knock-on effect you know I don't know I

4877.77 --> 4882.0
kind of disagree with that but well

4879.6 --> 4884.76
maybe mentally it may be a matter of

4882.0 --> 4885.83
perspective because for me it is Helen

4884.76 --> 4888.51
for Nathan

4885.83 --> 4891.84
the truth is better for your health

4888.51 --> 4893.13
really and all those and the nuisance

4891.84 --> 4896.28
that comes with that

4893.13 --> 4900.659000000001
yeah that's annoying but well it is a

4896.28 --> 4903.03
great relief for me actually to just me

4900.659 --> 4904.799999999999
personally it's more difficult I'll take

4903.03 --> 4906.389999999999
four why because the amount of hours

4904.8 --> 4908.429
that I've put into the research and

4906.39 --> 4910.1990000000005
going out and taking time of work and

4908.429 --> 4911.9400000000005
stuff like this and then spending the

4910.199 --> 4913.799999999999
time away from the missus and then

4911.94 --> 4915.33
trying to juggle my responsibilities

4913.8 --> 4917.55
with looking after mum or make cetera

4915.33 --> 4921.63
you know there's a lot of things that go

4917.55 --> 4924.06
into my day that leave no room for any

4921.63 --> 4926.01
personal time for myself you know so

4924.06 --> 4928.38
everything that I've done in the

4926.01 --> 4930.360000000001
research up to now the the work and

4928.38 --> 4932.25
stuff has had a big impact because I've

4930.36 --> 4933.839999999999
had to tell the people that I can't do

4932.25 --> 4935.46
this I can't go and socialize with you

4933.84 --> 4936.75
because I'm doing this or you know I

4935.46 --> 4938.4890000000005
don't have the time for that all that

4936.75 --> 4940.44
missus can't go you know we can't plan

4938.489 --> 4942.0
anything because there's always so much

4940.44 --> 4943.23
stuff going on it's the same in Nathan

4942.0 --> 4945.09
I'm sure it's the same with Bob from

4943.23 --> 4948.54
globe boosters everyone's putting a lot

4945.09 --> 4950.01
of stuff on a lot of time into this you

4948.54 --> 4952.35
know and taking time out of their

4950.01 --> 4954.09
personal life to invest themselves in

4952.35 --> 4956.58
this and we're not doing it for any

4954.09 --> 4958.679
other reason than to try and advance

4956.58 --> 4959.579
this argument because we have a belief

4958.679 --> 4962.52
in something we

4959.579 --> 4965.19
we were sure that we're right and we're

4962.52 --> 4968.429
trying to prove it and we will intercept

4965.19 --> 4970.53
rifice what we do you know how we live

4968.429 --> 4972.329
our lives in the real world too

4970.53 --> 4973.92
to talk to people online like what we're

4972.329 --> 4976.71
doing now you know we have to sacrifice

4973.92 --> 4978.96
things you have to do your daily show at

4976.71 --> 4981.51
1:00 p.m. every day right so you're

4978.96 --> 4983.969
actually sacrificing anything that could

4981.51 --> 4985.650000000001
happen during that day because if you

4983.969 --> 4988.349
was asked to go and let's say go with

4985.65 --> 4990.57
your friend to go to a town in a distant

4988.349 --> 4992.46
you know somewhere else you would have

4990.57 --> 4995.759999999999
to not do the show in the middle of the

4992.46 --> 4998.159
day but you don't do that you sacrifice

4995.76 --> 4999.84
an hour in the middle of the day which

4998.159 --> 5003.07
then commits you to basically be in a

4999.84 --> 5007.099
hole most of the day yeah am i right

5003.07 --> 5009.82
sorry I got distracted I'm so sorry it's

5007.099 --> 5014.4800000000005
not just it's not your right you say it

5009.82 --> 5016.308999999999
is something you have to factor into

5014.48 --> 5018.468999999999
your life this stuff though it's like

5016.309 --> 5022.25
last night planning Christmas around of

5018.469 --> 5024.139
all boss this just because no because

5022.25 --> 5026.21
you want to be on YouTube on YouTube

5024.139 --> 5027.92
anytime you want oh yeah but to actually

5026.21 --> 5031.79
like last night was a good example we

5027.92 --> 5033.9800000000005
all rocked up because it was too back

5031.79 --> 5037.639
the quality of the stuff that was there

5033.98 --> 5040.089999999999
and and to showcase it and you put that

5037.639 --> 5043.9890000000005
time and effort in like say knock for

5040.09 --> 5046.099
egotistical reasons of getting on

5043.989 --> 5048.19
YouTube channels but actually because

5046.099 --> 5050.809
you can see the value and you want to

5048.19 --> 5052.428999999999
pick this person up and tell people that

5050.809 --> 5054.7390000000005
do bother to listen to you come on

5052.429 --> 5058.1900000000005
listen to this guy's it stuffs spawned

5054.739 --> 5059.718999999999
and it it destroys the ball even more

5058.19 --> 5063.29
for you you know it's more evidence for

5059.719 --> 5066.71
you and maybe that's that's a passion is

5063.29 --> 5068.989
to just spread the truth was part of

5066.71 --> 5071.84
rocking around Europe I've you know I

5068.989 --> 5076.009999999999
mean wasn't as well as the enjoyment it

5071.84 --> 5076.28
was to and and face to face is fantastic

5076.01 --> 5079.400000000001
you know

5076.28 --> 5081.559
yes Bono is is so loved when we was at

5079.4 --> 5083.119
the train station Amsterdam are when

5081.559 --> 5085.429
it's it's kind of addictive in it once

5083.119 --> 5088.308999999999
you get that over that initial fear of

5085.429 --> 5089.21
somebody turning you down or good never

5088.309 --> 5091.13
great idea

5089.21 --> 5093.409
no I mean once you did start to get

5091.13 --> 5096.079
engaging at you with people one on

5093.409 --> 5098.598999999999
honest it's it's a very different genre

5096.079 --> 5100.909
to like what we were saying describing

5098.599 --> 5103.07
talking to the rumpus where it's mm-hm

5100.909 --> 5105.159
it's a futile thing but actually one on

5103.07 --> 5107.78
one that a lot of that [ __ ]

5105.159 --> 5109.339999999999
disappears you still got bits of it to

5107.78 --> 5112.039
deal with still got people's dissonance

5109.34 --> 5114.05
and their presuppositions and their

5112.039 --> 5116.57
religious beliefs to break through but

5114.05 --> 5118.900000000001
actually it's a it's a lot easier to do

5116.57 --> 5122.03
one on one and there's a lot less

5118.9 --> 5125.388999999999
nonsense aggression as well as your face

5122.03 --> 5127.039
it's more private so that yeah that

5125.389 --> 5129.499
makes it a little easier for people to

5127.039 --> 5131.09
base because if it's in public yeah

5129.499 --> 5133.82
you're gonna be seen by everyone you

5131.09 --> 5136.729
don't know where it's gonna end up so in

5133.82 --> 5138.739
private people can get a little less

5136.729 --> 5140.84
defensive than they typically would in a

5138.739 --> 5142.999
more public scenario and oh yeah I

5140.84 --> 5145.669
wanted to add something by the way about

5142.999 --> 5149.599
that whole situation Randy yeah you

5145.669 --> 5151.999
spent a lot of time on actual fieldwork

5149.599 --> 5154.55
and it did take what it did detract

5151.999 --> 5156.469
probably from your social life but in a

5154.55 --> 5160.159000000001
way I think it was probably also

5156.469 --> 5162.349
necessary because you you know you found

5160.159 --> 5164.808999999999
all this new stuff this flat earth and

5162.349 --> 5167.84
what that actually signifies in the

5164.809 --> 5169.809
social world and and you need the

5167.84 --> 5173.03
argument you need the material you need

5169.809 --> 5176.059
the things to talk about in order to

5173.03 --> 5179.749
really engage again in the social world

5176.059 --> 5182.119000000001
or you'll just be flat shamed by people

5179.749 --> 5184.76
if you didn't have all the things that

5182.119 --> 5186.978999999999
you've done so it it makes perfect sense

5184.76 --> 5189.169
really because if you would have just

5186.979 --> 5191.209
ignored all that and and got back in

5189.169 --> 5193.669
your social life you'd be trying to

5191.209 --> 5195.349
discuss things while you've haven't

5193.669 --> 5197.09
actually done all the research there's

5195.349 --> 5199.4490000000005
still so many questions you have to deal

5197.09 --> 5201.349
with and that gives you less

5199.449 --> 5204.169
maneuverability it gives you less weight

5201.349 --> 5207.110000000001
socially so it is only sensible that you

5204.169 --> 5209.36
just spent a lot of time on this so you

5207.11 --> 5213.139
really got your you got your base now

5209.36 --> 5215.36
you got your base socially to I think

5213.139 --> 5217.789
most people that are in this argument

5215.36 --> 5220.759999999999
are very focused and I think that you

5217.789 --> 5223.188999999999
know I have that same drive as well you

5220.76 --> 5224.479
know everybody seems you know this stuck

5223.189 --> 5226.97
around everyone that stuck around

5224.479 --> 5229.37
including you know everybody Adam you

5226.97 --> 5231.62
when just everybody that's here is very

5229.37 --> 5234.11
focused and determined to actually see

5231.62 --> 5237.68
things through to the end you know we

5234.11 --> 5239.389999999999
won't be we won't be dissuaded from our

5237.68 --> 5240.59
research no matter if we make things

5239.39 --> 5242.75
wrong you know we're not the type of

5240.59 --> 5245.66
people that get offended if we get

5242.75 --> 5247.07
something wrong you know we dust it off

5245.66 --> 5248.51
when we put it down to experience and

5247.07 --> 5251.96
then we learn from that and then we use

5248.51 --> 5254.030000000001
that to fold our next line of research

5251.96 --> 5256.61
and that's how we do things you know I

5254.03 --> 5258.5599999999995
mean and if you did I don't think

5256.61 --> 5261.65
everybody's like that but I think a lot

5258.56 --> 5264.59
of people respect that in somebody you

5261.65 --> 5270.32
know that can actually do that right

5264.59 --> 5272.51
yeah a little real dedication yeah but

5270.32 --> 5274.82
we're not doing in quality and we're not

5272.51 --> 5279.8
doing it for fame or fortune because

5274.82 --> 5281.36
there is normally in flatus in fact if

5279.8 --> 5284.54
your globe Earth oh if he wanted to make

5281.36 --> 5286.4
money in this argument become a global

5284.54 --> 5287.57
Thor and make a channel doing hit videos

5286.4 --> 5290.509999999999
against flat-earthers because you'll

5287.57 --> 5294.679999999999
make an absolute fortune don't spread

5290.51 --> 5297.35
any ideas we got enough of them already

5294.68 --> 5300.530000000001
it's just it's all filler though it's

5297.35 --> 5303.110000000001
really these people are just riding on

5300.53 --> 5306.41
pretense on mimicking what they've seen

5303.11 --> 5308.54
others do because we all know that most

5306.41 --> 5310.67
of the new ballers that are out there on

5308.54 --> 5313.34
their own little channels when really

5310.67 --> 5317.4800000000005
confronted they would they wouldn't

5313.34 --> 5319.55
stand up against a group of veteran

5317.48 --> 5322.82
flat-earthers that have gone out and

5319.55 --> 5328.04
debated things for four years they stand

5322.82 --> 5330.29
no chance it would melt it's as simple

5328.04 --> 5332.9
as that and that's why they don't want

5330.29 --> 5334.97
to get into a one-on-one with anybody

5332.9 --> 5337.04
the conspiracy cats the Simon Dunne's

5334.97 --> 5338.75
they never jump into they'll never

5337.04 --> 5340.04
they'll never do one-on-ones with

5338.75 --> 5340.91
anybody that's from the Flat Earth

5340.04 --> 5343.91
debate team

5340.91 --> 5344.99
Heather you won't do that you know it's

5343.91 --> 5347.54
just not what they do they're not

5344.99 --> 5350.69
they're not that way inclined because

5347.54 --> 5351.95
they know they'll get crushed and no MIT

5350.69 --> 5354.08
to be fair

5351.95 --> 5356.599999999999
Simon Dan would never we all know that

5354.08 --> 5358.95
now that's like his character trait but

5356.6 --> 5362.450000000001
conspiracy cats did yet

5358.95 --> 5367.83
my show remember that one time so

5362.45 --> 5371.88
mistake though duh that's what happens

5367.83 --> 5373.98
but at least it was honest he wasn't

5371.88 --> 5378.24
I don't think conspiracy catch is like a

5373.98 --> 5381.15
real coward he's just like a kitty and I

5378.24 --> 5384.48
think he's he's very naive but I don't

5381.15 --> 5388.219999999999
think he's like a real coward I think

5384.48 --> 5391.0199999999995
Simon Dan is one I'm not attacking

5388.22 --> 5392.91
individuals here Owen but again the

5391.02 --> 5396.06
conspiracy cats one is another good

5392.91 --> 5399.36
example of intellectual honesty now if I

5396.06 --> 5403.620000000001
was on that side and wanted to argue

5399.36 --> 5406.92
that I would still as the scientist in

5403.62 --> 5409.71
me the one this you you know it's still

5406.92 --> 5412.59
happy to use valid scientific data I

5409.71 --> 5415.9800000000005
would still have to recognize the

5412.59 --> 5417.900000000001
contradiction in my baller argument I

5415.98 --> 5419.7
would still want to recognize that be

5417.9 --> 5421.95
with a conspiracy cast there's still

5419.7 --> 5425.49
there's still not that there he still

5421.95 --> 5428.79
will state that the earth is a ball and

5425.49 --> 5431.19
the the vacuum of space exists next to

5428.79 --> 5433.53
our atmosphere but he'll then make a

5431.19 --> 5435.2699999999995
statement that you you know without the

5433.53 --> 5438.2699999999995
container you can't there is no pressure

5435.27 --> 5440.34
but he won't address that contradiction

5438.27 --> 5442.620000000001
in any direct manner he wanted Wesley

5440.34 --> 5446.360000000001
Gazza face model and that yeah and and

5442.62 --> 5448.44
so whilst I wouldn't say he's dishonest

5446.36 --> 5452.13
and so he's not got the personality

5448.44 --> 5454.919999999999
issues of some of the others but you

5452.13 --> 5457.56
know he's still not in my opinion honest

5454.92 --> 5461.1900000000005
when I approach this as a baller that's

5457.56 --> 5463.68
one of the contradictions that I looked

5461.19 --> 5465.719999999999
at and and recognized do you not mean it

5463.68 --> 5468.51
was one of the turning points but it

5465.72 --> 5471.63
still seems to be that lack of inability

5468.51 --> 5478.110000000001
to recognize the contradiction in their

5471.63 --> 5480.27
own model even with its naivety a good

5478.11 --> 5481.799999999999
example of that because Djokovic's in

5480.27 --> 5483.63
the channel is just in the challenge

5481.8 --> 5485.22
just reminded me that George Nessa nukes

5483.63 --> 5487.41
been on my show several times well

5485.22 --> 5490.110000000001
that's true he came on to talk about

5487.41 --> 5491.79
Coriolis effect and then after he's did

5490.11 --> 5492.509999999999
his presentation and he's told us all

5491.79 --> 5495.51
about Cory

5492.51 --> 5497.25
all this he then got a few comments in

5495.51 --> 5499.68
the chat after the video was uploaded

5497.25 --> 5502.92
and then he applied to come on the show

5499.68 --> 5505.650000000001
again and do another video about

5502.92 --> 5507.12
Coriolis and then he went back and he

5505.65 --> 5509.849999999999
came back and he did in norther video

5507.12 --> 5512.43
about Coriolis effect and how now this

5509.85 --> 5514.56
was the right one to believe in and then

5512.43 --> 5516.450000000001
when he got slammed on that one he then

5514.56 --> 5518.31
got in touch with me again and wanted to

5516.45 --> 5521.07
come back and do another video on

5518.31 --> 5523.17
Coriolis for the third time which he did

5521.07 --> 5524.639999999999
and then the same thing happened again

5523.17 --> 5528.78
and then he applied to come on for a

5524.64 --> 5531.570000000001
fourth time and I said no this because I

5528.78 --> 5533.94
mean if you can't get it right you know

5531.57 --> 5535.889999999999
if you you know if this is how difficult

5533.94 --> 5537.75
it is just to get one thing right that

5535.89 --> 5539.42
you spend two or three hours on my

5537.75 --> 5542.55
shoulder in a full presentation

5539.42 --> 5544.08
uninterrupted for three three separate

5542.55 --> 5546.6900000000005
shows and then you want to come on the

5544.08 --> 5549.78
fourth one and do it again then there's

5546.69 --> 5551.339999999999
no hope how many times you know this is

5549.78 --> 5553.86
supposed to be one of their leading guys

5551.34 --> 5555.33
a scientist yeah a leading scientist

5553.86 --> 5558.42
that's gonna come on and talk to us and

5555.33 --> 5560.28
tell us this stuff and then just people

5558.42 --> 5561.51
are picking apart his argument and then

5560.28 --> 5563.639999999999
he wants to come back again and again

5561.51 --> 5565.110000000001
and again and again you know this is

5563.64 --> 5568.77
where I would get frustrated it's like

5565.11 --> 5573.54
George's your truths yeah George's

5568.77 --> 5575.580000000001
presentations are kind of if you think

5573.54 --> 5580.22
about what Ben was saying last night in

5575.58 --> 5584.01
the psychology bit where he's trying to

5580.22 --> 5587.7300000000005
insert himself as the expert by giving

5584.01 --> 5589.97
all of this superfluous waffle that he

5587.73 --> 5593.16
tends to give the non non relative

5589.97 --> 5596.22
detail he tries to say himself up as

5593.16 --> 5599.13
some expert so that when he then does

5596.22 --> 5601.89
come to his nonsensical conclusions

5599.13 --> 5604.05
you're you've been downgraded and you

5601.89 --> 5606.4800000000005
sit underneath his authority to just

5604.05 --> 5608.49
accept a bit like when you at school and

5606.48 --> 5610.83
they tell you we're on a boat you know

5608.49 --> 5612.389999999999
you know it's nonsense but you sit under

5610.83 --> 5614.79
the authority of the teacher and that's

5612.39 --> 5617.070000000001
what a lot of his presentations are

5614.79 --> 5619.71
about the long-winded miss the extra

5617.07 --> 5622.0199999999995
detail is there to subconsciously try

5619.71 --> 5624.27
and set your job as an expert in your

5622.02 --> 5626.099
mind even though as you see in a lot of

5624.27 --> 5628.59
his presentations he gets confused

5626.099 --> 5630.4800000000005
guess a lot of the more basic from the

5628.59 --> 5633.75
man that was wrong or doesn't understand

5630.48 --> 5635.879999999999
them but now that's kind of why I think

5633.75 --> 5638.159
right he that's why he does it that way

5635.88 --> 5640.679
because there is no real substance it's

5638.159 --> 5642.8099999999995
just a matter of trying to make the

5640.679 --> 5645.3
audience believe he's very very very

5642.81 --> 5648.75
knowledgeable in all these things but

5645.3 --> 5651.09
rumbas also does that a lot in his own

5648.75 --> 5653.429
way so it is kind of a thing that was

5651.09 --> 5655.849
there from the beginning it's like

5653.429 --> 5658.1990000000005
everybody wants all of the ballers

5655.849 --> 5661.619000000001
wherever they are whatever they doing

5658.199 --> 5665.04
they kind of want to have this expert I

5661.619 --> 5667.589999999999
come they want themselves to be seen as

5665.04 --> 5670.86
an expert icon because experts work

5667.59 --> 5673.5
really well in their religion they're

5670.86 --> 5676.889
usually respected and people that are

5673.5 --> 5678.81
not so very smart will very easily then

5676.889 --> 5681.54
just point him in like oh yeah I like

5678.81 --> 5684.4800000000005
the way he talks he sounds smart

5681.54 --> 5686.699
I'll rely on him for now and that's what

5684.48 --> 5690.0199999999995
they want they want to be those experts

5686.699 --> 5690.0199999999995
in the scene

5692.599 --> 5704.8
I couldn't cut excellent yeah great

5699.889 --> 5704.8
great conversation guys I really like it

5704.889 --> 5709.399
was we're in this natural law I'm gonna

5707.419 --> 5711.219
I want to shoot off my cruise kickoffs

5709.399 --> 5714.530000000001
in 20 minutes

5711.219 --> 5719.929
drink settle down have a little bit of

5714.53 --> 5721.999
football bring us to the ball it's still

5719.929 --> 5726.05
my still my main three vice I'm not

5721.999 --> 5728.269
giving it all I I really enjoy being

5726.05 --> 5731.659000000001
upset as far as get be every week so

5728.269 --> 5736.129
yeah all right now I'm just playing it

5731.659 --> 5738.079
three no don't want to know I'll leave

5736.129 --> 5742.099
it there I'll send you a text with the

5738.079 --> 5745.369
fixes you have fun with that all right

5742.099 --> 5747.079
guys have a good intern call that speech

5745.369 --> 5750.558999999999
before so Happy New Year guys are now

5747.079 --> 5750.978999999999
I'll catch you next year yeah see you

5750.559 --> 5754.76
later

5750.979 --> 5757.070000000001
yeah guys fight right huh

5754.76 --> 5758.84
shall I run out the show or you had

5757.07 --> 5761.449
something more yeah I wanted to talk

5758.84 --> 5763.309
about it Randy I'm not sure there's much

5761.449 --> 5766.669
else to talk about other than you know

5763.309 --> 5768.079000000001
we we just won and honest you know let's

5766.669 --> 5768.949
leave it like this that for the

5768.079 --> 5770.268999999999
following year

5768.949 --> 5772.638999999999
you know we're gonna lay down this

5770.269 --> 5775.129
gauntlet to the globus to try and be

5772.639 --> 5776.689
intellectually honest you know that's

5775.129 --> 5778.789
that's what we're asking for here you

5776.689 --> 5782.149
know we've had enough obfuscation we've

5778.789 --> 5785.179
had enough arguing debating about things

5782.149 --> 5787.999000000001
that make no real difference to anything

5785.179 --> 5789.829
you know the terminology of words and a

5787.999 --> 5793.398999999999
shoe is a shoe you know a shoe is

5789.829 --> 5796.009999999999
whatever guys so frustrating just come

5793.399 --> 5798.05
in and talk to us talk to us be honest

5796.01 --> 5799.189
intellectually honest you know that's

5798.05 --> 5800.329000000001
your challenge for the next year I don't

5799.189 --> 5803.059
want to come back here in a year's time

5800.329 --> 5804.59
and have to replay this clip of me

5803.059 --> 5806.359
telling you to try and be intellectually

5804.59 --> 5808.34
honest always have another year of you

5806.359 --> 5811.039000000001
being totally the opposite and not being

5808.34 --> 5813.59
intellectually honest I don't hold my

5811.039 --> 5815.179
breath that that's gonna be the case but

5813.59 --> 5817.28
if we're ever gonna make any progress

5815.179 --> 5823.459
here you know there's this is how it's

5817.28 --> 5824.929
got to be you know well yeah I don't

5823.459 --> 5826.3099999999995
think it's gonna work out though I don't

5824.929 --> 5828.26
think ballers will be

5826.31 --> 5830.6
intellectually honest because they'd

5828.26 --> 5832.93
literally lose the vast majority of

5830.6 --> 5835.34
their entire grip on the situation

5832.93 --> 5837.92
because they have so many so little wins

5835.34 --> 5841.31
so I don't think we can get them that

5837.92 --> 5845.09
far although look eventually I think

5841.31 --> 5847.22
that maybe during 2020 we might see in

5845.09 --> 5850.34
this I don't know for sure but we might

5847.22 --> 5853.610000000001
see like this slightly unexpected shift

5850.34 --> 5856.58
among more general ballers that some may

5853.61 --> 5858.469999999999
actually think like get a bit sick of

5856.58 --> 5860.84
the situation and where it's going and

5858.47 --> 5863.87
just say like yeah well you know what

5860.84 --> 5865.64
maybe the ball was kind of incorrect I'm

5863.87 --> 5868.82
gonna be on the fence now instead of

5865.64 --> 5871.660000000001
being automatically on the globe side

5868.82 --> 5874.7
maybe that might happen because hey

5871.66 --> 5876.59
everything is shifting and whether you

5874.7 --> 5879.08
look at the arguments and then decide

5876.59 --> 5882.02
upon that or ignore it or you're just

5879.08 --> 5884.75
looking at the feeling of it all and how

5882.02 --> 5886.84
the social interactions and energies are

5884.75 --> 5891.17
taking place and where that's going

5886.84 --> 5893.0
they're they they must take notice of

5891.17 --> 5896.6900000000005
the day they could not not take notice

5893.0 --> 5900.65
of this even if you are like a fanatical

5896.69 --> 5903.49
baller concerning the arguments so I

5900.65 --> 5906.41
think that there probably will be

5903.49 --> 5908.21
maybe handful maybe a lot more of the

5906.41 --> 5910.37
more general ballers that are going to

5908.21 --> 5913.61
kind of step away from the ball side and

5910.37 --> 5916.099999999999
be more neutral or maybe even come to

5913.61 --> 5919.5199999999995
the other side who knows because hey

5916.1 --> 5921.8
Flat Earth is a socially now pretty vast

5919.52 --> 5923.81
and an interesting place to be and

5921.8 --> 5927.14
meeting up with other flat-earthers is a

5923.81 --> 5929.51
blast it's great it was awesome

5927.14 --> 5931.400000000001
Amsterdam the Amsterdam Flat Earth

5929.51 --> 5933.9800000000005
conference was awesome it was an

5931.4 --> 5938.0
exhilarating experience was a buzz of

5933.98 --> 5941.12
energy and that's gonna appeal to people

5938.0 --> 5943.79
especially those that are just going to

5941.12 --> 5947.0599999999995
feel more and more and more isolated

5943.79 --> 5950.2699999999995
among their peers what's astonishing to

5947.06 --> 5952.34
me is the amount of people that are

5950.27 --> 5954.47
actually in groups on Facebook and stuff

5952.34 --> 5956.09
like that if you look for all the

5954.47 --> 5958.46
different Flat Earth groups that are out

5956.09 --> 5959.96
there there are in some of there were

5958.46 --> 5962.42
hundreds of thousands of

5959.96 --> 5964.58
people that are actually in those groups

5962.42 --> 5966.2300000000005
that are actually talking on topics and

5964.58 --> 5968.719
stuff and it surprises me because if you

5966.23 --> 5971.599999999999
think about the amount the audience is

5968.719 --> 5974.92
that we supposedly get on YouTube with

5971.6 --> 5977.6
fast smaller than the Facebook groups

5974.92 --> 5978.92
far smaller and that to me doesn't make

5977.6 --> 5980.63
any kind of sense so I don't know

5978.92 --> 5982.07
whether it's the algorithms messing

5980.63 --> 5985.219
around with stuff or what-have-you

5982.07 --> 5987.049999999999
I think yeah but I do feel that you know

5985.219 --> 5989.36
maybe should maybe people should start

5987.05 --> 5991.64
joining those groups and and linking up

5989.36 --> 5993.5599999999995
some of the the videos on YouTube to try

5991.64 --> 5996.89
and draw some of that traffic from

5993.56 --> 5998.96
Facebook to YouTube where people can

5996.89 --> 6000.88
interact in real time in a different way

5998.96 --> 6002.53
because you know maybe people wanna

6000.88 --> 6003.91
listen to things on the way to work and

6002.53 --> 6006.91
stuff like that they can listen to the

6003.91 --> 6008.469
debates but you know maybe something for

6006.91 --> 6012.099999999999
people to actually get involved with

6008.469 --> 6014.68
going forward to try and expand the

6012.1 --> 6017.02
movement to a larger audience right

6014.68 --> 6020.280000000001
unless we're being suppressed here yeah

6017.02 --> 6022.51
but hey we are probably being algorithm

6020.28 --> 6024.55
algorithmically suppressed to some

6022.51 --> 6025.84
degree at least we don't know how far

6024.55 --> 6028.0
you know could be

6025.84 --> 6030.219
I sometimes speculate not that I'd

6028.0 --> 6031.93
necessarily want this but that I could

6030.219 --> 6036.31
have like a hundred thousand followers

6031.93 --> 6040.38
instead of 1,600 it could be I don't

6036.31 --> 6043.870000000001
know I seem to have some like people do

6040.38 --> 6047.35
address me Rek seem to recognize me out

6043.87 --> 6050.65
there in in in youtube and even on the

6047.35 --> 6053.110000000001
life so I don't know the real viewer

6050.65 --> 6055.45
announces it doesn't really matter to me

6053.11 --> 6059.589999999999
in the end as long as I can just do my

6055.45 --> 6064.92
thing but now I lost the train of

6059.59 --> 6069.55
thought well yeah algorithmic

6064.92 --> 6073.2390000000005
suppression right yeah I think that we

6069.55 --> 6076.21
can bypass this algorithmic suppression

6073.239 --> 6078.79
the easiest way to do it is just a later

6076.21 --> 6081.67
connection because it is the connective

6078.79 --> 6083.44
structure of the overarching thing of

6081.67 --> 6086.95
all the information of all the videos

6083.44 --> 6089.259999999999
and the pointing at other videos that is

6086.95 --> 6092.62
against us as flat earth but that

6089.26 --> 6093.79
doesn't mean that we cannot look around

6092.62 --> 6096.34
ourselves

6093.79 --> 6098.32
not rely upon the algorithm so much but

6096.34 --> 6100.02
look around ourselves and then lay those

6098.32 --> 6102.759999999999
connections make those connections

6100.02 --> 6105.160000000001
ourselves lay the links from our

6102.76 --> 6106.900000000001
channels to their groups and ask them to

6105.16 --> 6109.45
lay their link from their channel to our

6106.9 --> 6112.0
groups and then just force that

6109.45 --> 6116.29
connection a bit force open the roads

6112.0 --> 6118.9
between so we won't be dependent on the

6116.29 --> 6122.11
algorithm and to do that for us no we

6118.9 --> 6124.36
can lay basic connections ourselves

6122.11 --> 6129.67
within all of our communities and just

6124.36 --> 6132.16
connect up it's interesting that the the

6129.67 --> 6134.61
people talking on Facebook the the pack

6132.16 --> 6137.44
hunters in on Facebook because there are

6134.61 --> 6141.339999999999
and there's also pack hunters for the

6137.44 --> 6144.04
for the flat as well I mean this was he

6141.34 --> 6147.22
called Johnny level for instance he has

6144.04 --> 6150.25
a huge following and a lot of people

6147.22 --> 6152.35
that follow his work too so there are P

6150.25 --> 6154.86
you know there are around avenues there

6152.35 --> 6157.21
for this kind of interaction to be

6154.86 --> 6160.8099999999995
broadened you know where we can get more

6157.21 --> 6162.52
people involved on YouTube as opposed to

6160.81 --> 6164.71
just sticking on Facebook because I

6162.52 --> 6168.070000000001
would like to interact with these these

6164.71 --> 6170.26
people people that have got either good

6168.07 --> 6172.09
following or just a good argument you

6170.26 --> 6175.12
know a good global with a good argument

6172.09 --> 6177.7
that's something that is fresh no no the

6175.12 --> 6180.43
rhombuses and the rule ifs you know

6177.7 --> 6183.099999999999
these guys are all last year in the year

6180.43 --> 6185.92
before you know we was sick and tired

6183.1 --> 6188.02
listening to these ideas you know let's

6185.92 --> 6192.13
get some fresh people and you know bring

6188.02 --> 6200.02
some fresh people in yeah some root for

6192.13 --> 6203.650000000001
in a squeezer reminds me I've got my own

6200.02 --> 6206.02
show again at 4 p.m. today so just over

6203.65 --> 6207.3099999999995
an hour's time an hour in 10 minutes 17

6206.02 --> 6208.84
minutes from now I'll be going live

6207.31 --> 6213.1
again that's the trigger there through

6208.84 --> 6215.92
the year awards top three announced so

6213.1 --> 6219.070000000001
cool okay I'll make sure to put out the

6215.92 --> 6221.85
link of that show in the chat so people

6219.07 --> 6221.849999999999
can go there

6222.73 --> 6228.61
if you got to LinkedIn you can post it

6224.89 --> 6230.47
in the YouTube chat as well uh it's okay

6228.61 --> 6232.24
I'll put another up on I've gotten I've

6230.47 --> 6235.150000000001
got my show up I'll just put a link on

6232.24 --> 6238.33
my community status if you do get a jump

6235.15 --> 6242.009999999999
so try and tune in Ranchi Flat Earth and

6238.33 --> 6244.72
that will be at 4 p.m. British time

6242.01 --> 6246.09
London yeah I will be there I think

6244.72 --> 6249.820000000001
there you go

6246.09 --> 6252.51
let me link up who knows you you might

6249.82 --> 6254.799999999999
actually be in the top three oh god I

6252.51 --> 6256.84
don't know you know I mean I mean I

6254.8 --> 6258.34
wouldn't know this personally but

6256.84 --> 6259.6
there's a possibility that you could be

6258.34 --> 6262.21
in the top three

6259.6 --> 6263.9800000000005
goody and if that's the case then that

6262.21 --> 6267.7300000000005
means that you know unfortunately it

6263.98 --> 6271.209999999999
Matt have to dig up some more triggered

6267.73 --> 6277.66
moments come on why we all know what

6271.21 --> 6282.1
they are I might have to flag that for

6277.66 --> 6285.2699999999995
exposing vulnerable individuals yeah and

6282.1 --> 6288.01
that is a specific flag a bold tag

6285.27 --> 6295.21
system and it's kind of true in that

6288.01 --> 6297.01
case anyway make sure you - then make

6295.21 --> 6298.78
sure you tune in it's like hard it's

6297.01 --> 6302.62
Christmas we can go about to kill in the

6298.78 --> 6304.69
glow goes next year we can indeed we can

6302.62 --> 6306.88
okay so yeah I'm gonna round out the

6304.69 --> 6310.0
