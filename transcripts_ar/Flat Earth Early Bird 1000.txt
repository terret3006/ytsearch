right

96.479 --> 102.4
so

98.24 --> 102.39999999999999
when the today is quite gorgeous

102.88 --> 106.479
it's been really beautiful

107.119 --> 111.6
still a couple of clouds here and there

108.96 --> 114.079
but most of it is just clear skied very

111.6 --> 116.479
clear no trails

114.079 --> 119.6
that i can spot

116.479 --> 121.52
and especially almost no wind it's

119.6 --> 124.079
almost completely wind still and that

121.52 --> 124.079
just makes

125.52 --> 128.959
yeah

126.32 --> 131.92
that in combination with the sun

128.959 --> 134.8
makes it really nice pleasant

131.92 --> 138.07999999999998
sunny day currently

134.8 --> 138.08
wonder if it'll last

138.16 --> 142.79999999999998
into the evening but yeah it's it's

140.959 --> 146.16
really nice

142.8 --> 146.16000000000003
it's just there on the roof

147.52 --> 151.44
enjoying the sun and it's great

152.16 --> 157.519
let me check the temperature

154.48 --> 159.92
it should probably be like 20 degrees 21

157.519 --> 164.08
degrees again

159.92 --> 166.72
oh wait no it's 19. huh

164.08 --> 169.84
i guess then because of the

166.72 --> 171.28
lack of wind it just seems much warmer

169.84 --> 172.879
right

171.28 --> 175.28
temperature is always measured in the

172.879 --> 175.28
shadow

177.12 --> 179.59900000000002
anyway

182.959 --> 189.64000000000001
it is thursday the second of september

186.64 --> 189.64
2021

192.8 --> 197.28
i'll be doing a two-hour show today

197.599 --> 203.83999999999997
let's

198.959 --> 207.519
see if somebody's gonna get in my chat

203.84 --> 207.519
and get the show going

210.72 --> 213.72
uh

215.28 --> 220.64000000000001
in the meantime i'll just start talking

217.04 --> 224.4
about what i was doing yesterday

220.64 --> 224.39999999999998
right so yesterday i was

224.72 --> 229.68
in a really bad mood overall i was kind

227.519 --> 230.56
of stressed out

229.68 --> 233.76000000000002
like

230.56 --> 236.0
if i had to describe it in words like

233.76 --> 238.72
cramped i was cramped

236.0 --> 240.56
and that's because basically

238.72 --> 243.68
two ladies

240.56 --> 245.92000000000002
basically just freshly moved in here and

243.68 --> 248.48000000000002
i'm like okay i have to adapt i have to

245.92 --> 250.48
adapt it

248.48 --> 253.04
because i've had plenty of experiences

250.48 --> 255.599
in the past

253.04 --> 258.239
where my roommates

255.599 --> 260.479
would yeah there would start a gap in

258.239 --> 263.12
communication for some reason and then

260.479 --> 266.56
they would like get really nitpicky on

263.12 --> 269.52
anything they noticed about me

266.56 --> 272.479
so i'm always very wary about that and

269.52 --> 274.71999999999997
nervous it's like okay this is

272.479 --> 275.88
having new roommates to me is almost

274.72 --> 278.99
like

275.88 --> 278.99
[Music]

282.32 --> 287.52
soliciting for a new job in a way you

285.04 --> 291.12
have to i have to be like a hyper

287.52 --> 293.44
focused and to the point and perfect

291.12 --> 294.96
like unreasonably so just for the

293.44 --> 296.96
impression of it

294.96 --> 298.479
i guess a lot of people know about how

296.96 --> 300.63899999999995
that's like

298.479 --> 303.039
and i get that every time new people

300.639 --> 305.199
move in

303.039 --> 308.15999999999997
especially ladies

305.199 --> 310.24
right but so far it's been great

308.16 --> 312.47900000000004
i've gotten to know the other roommate a

310.24 --> 312.479
little

312.8 --> 318.32
and guess what

316.0 --> 321.84
she's like an artist

318.32 --> 324.56
as in visual artist painting

321.84 --> 327.44
really the arts

324.56 --> 329.6
so she studies that sort of thing and

327.44 --> 331.919
focused on

329.6 --> 334.96000000000004
social engineering

331.919 --> 337.44
and she's very into that apparently

334.96 --> 338.479
just like very interesting

337.44 --> 342.88
and

338.479 --> 345.36
her projects currently are focused on

342.88 --> 346.88
basically the knowledge of visual

345.36 --> 347.84000000000003
triggering

346.88 --> 350.08
like

347.84 --> 353.039
how do you get people's attention really

350.08 --> 355.59999999999997
quickly and the mechanics of it it's

353.039 --> 357.36
quite fascinating to have

355.6 --> 359.52000000000004
somebody in the house that's actually

357.36 --> 361.68
focused on that so i think we're

359.52 --> 363.59999999999997
probably gonna have quite a few

361.68 --> 365.36
interesting conversations looking

363.6 --> 367.84000000000003
forward to it other than that she's a

365.36 --> 367.84000000000003
really nice

368.08 --> 370.8
wise girl

374.319 --> 376.56
so

377.68 --> 383.12
yeah

379.039 --> 384.8
hey hello mike zedunic

383.12 --> 387.199
cleary

384.8 --> 390.08
da commissar

387.199 --> 392.319
it's all kinds of new people in here

390.08 --> 395.28
welcome to the flat earth early bear

392.319 --> 398.319
chat

395.28 --> 400.88
happy 1000th episode thank you

398.319 --> 403.52000000000004
i think it should be yesterday i was not

400.88 --> 403.52
happy at all

404.16 --> 407.52000000000004
but today it seems like that changed

406.0 --> 408.479
around i feel kind of good the weather

407.52 --> 411.44
is nice

408.479 --> 411.44
i'm calm

418.0 --> 422.96
and i'm open for conversations

420.8 --> 424.8
oh poof by the way

422.96 --> 427.19899999999996
the

424.8 --> 429.68
already yeah the other roommate

427.199 --> 432.56
the one that i thought was kind of cute

429.68 --> 434.0
she basically moved in furniture

432.56 --> 438.88
and drapes

434.0 --> 438.88
and i was like utterly stunned

438.96 --> 443.44
because it seems

441.12 --> 445.28000000000003
like she has a

443.44 --> 446.479
really

445.28 --> 448.55999999999995
really

446.479 --> 451.199
similar taste to me

448.56 --> 454.0
as in she likes

451.199 --> 457.36
same colors she likes she had like this

454.0 --> 461.28
new table moving in i was like wow

457.36 --> 464.8
i have a table like that in my storage

461.28 --> 467.75899999999996
sort of all very close to that

464.8 --> 467.759
so yeah

472.319 --> 475.199
that was uh

475.52 --> 479.75899999999996
it is interesting i don't know what's

477.36 --> 483.039
gonna grow out of that though i have no

479.759 --> 484.47900000000004
idea i just know like wow i'm i'm really

483.039 --> 487.039
into this girl

484.479 --> 489.28
just on the surface at least

487.039 --> 492.479
i still got to know her i get i have to

489.28 --> 495.599
get to know her

492.479 --> 495.599
we'll see what happens

499.599 --> 504.71999999999997
but i think overall it's going to be a

501.44 --> 504.71999999999997
pretty interesting year

505.28 --> 508.55999999999995
hello one father unit

508.72 --> 511.12
yep

509.599 --> 513.68
thousands show

511.12 --> 513.68
that's right

518.959 --> 523.039
right so

521.2 --> 525.6800000000001
that's for the

523.039 --> 529.4399999999999
at home activities oh also ah

525.68 --> 529.4399999999999
subscribers is going down again

530.8 --> 535.8389999999999
it's oh wait no it got back up again it

533.44 --> 537.9200000000001
went down to 2002 but now it's back up

535.839 --> 540.32
to 2008.

537.92 --> 542.24
i think they're just trying they're just

540.32 --> 544.8000000000001
trying

542.24 --> 546.8
to get it below the 2000

544.8 --> 549.12
or i think they wanted to

546.8 --> 550.64
get it below it during the thousandth

549.12 --> 553.12
episode

550.64 --> 556.0
it's their own way of like celebrating

553.12 --> 556.0
anniversaries

560.48 --> 564.9590000000001
yeah but doesn't seem to work

562.48 --> 567.6
i got plenty of down votes though very

564.959 --> 570.4799999999999
quickly look at that

567.6 --> 572.0
but that's all fine right

570.48 --> 574.48
maybe you could get it to a minus

572.0 --> 574.48
thousand

574.64 --> 578.8
if you get it eight trolls if you get

576.88 --> 580.88
the votes during the live stream to

578.8 --> 583.279
minus one thousand

580.88 --> 585.76
i'll actually show it on the screen how

583.279 --> 585.76
about that

586.399 --> 591.04

591.04 --> 596.56

lot do not forget about adam like

648.079 --> 652.7199999999999
without adam

649.839 --> 652.72
my show would have

653.36 --> 655.6
been

656.32 --> 659.44
well less

657.6 --> 661.76
beautiful to behold he's helped me with

659.44 --> 663.519
the title cards but especially do not

661.76 --> 665.279

663.519 --> 667.76
don't take it for granted if it wasn't

665.279 --> 670.64
for adam i would not have this amazing

667.76 --> 670.64
looking background

673.279 --> 676.48
hey steamy traveler

680.64 --> 685.12
right also yeah the title card for

682.56 --> 687.279
today's show also by adam he made it

685.12 --> 692.72
like a week ago but it was a pretty good

687.279 --> 692.72
one like with the giant flock of birds

692.959 --> 700.16
in there it was nice

696.24 --> 700.16
hey pg cruise shank good to see you

701.12 --> 705.68
yeah so thanks everybody

703.519 --> 707.92
thank you guys in chat

705.68 --> 710.6389999999999
it's you guys really

707.92 --> 712.88
i know i i say it i it's almost like it

710.639 --> 715.2
sounds like commercial but in my case

712.88 --> 717.279
it's actually really true

715.2 --> 718.0790000000001
without you guys in chat

717.279 --> 720.72
and

718.079 --> 722.6389999999999
the financial support on top of that

720.72 --> 724.639
there would be no flat earth early word

722.639 --> 727.12
show

724.639 --> 730.16
it really wouldn't be there i

727.12 --> 732.079
i can't imagine having doing a thousand

730.16 --> 734.56
shows without

732.079 --> 738.8
your input

734.56 --> 738.8
and especially your questions right

739.36 --> 746.399
i don't always have like this library of

742.56 --> 746.399
subjects in the back of my mind

747.36 --> 753.2
maybe i do but i just kind of

750.16 --> 754.639
chose to let it

753.2 --> 756.24
come forth

754.639 --> 759.44
from me

756.24 --> 763.6800000000001
upon connecting with somebody in chat

759.44 --> 763.6800000000001
like somebody in chat has to be willing

764.079 --> 770.2399999999999
to basically hear me out

767.44 --> 772.48
about something before

770.24 --> 774.0790000000001
before i bring it up

772.48 --> 776.24
because there's endless amounts of

774.079 --> 778.8
subjects

776.24 --> 781.6
in all directions

778.8 --> 784.3199999999999
and so yeah

781.6 --> 787.0400000000001
to randomly pick one i have tried it

784.32 --> 789.7600000000001
sometimes it works but more than half of

787.04 --> 791.5999999999999
the times it doesn't really work

789.76 --> 794.48
but every time somebody brings something

791.6 --> 794.48
up in the chat

794.72 --> 799.12
it flows very

796.48 --> 801.6800000000001
eloquently

799.12 --> 803.519
so thank you all for being part of my

801.68 --> 806.16
chat during all these flat earth early

803.519 --> 806.16
bird shows

808.079 --> 812.8389999999999
and help me reach the thousand

810.8 --> 816.3199999999999
thousandth

812.839 --> 819.6
episode looking forward to the tooth

816.32 --> 819.6
dude that's like

822.079 --> 825.519
that's gonna take a while man

825.76 --> 829.8389999999999
that's gonna take another three years

832.24 --> 835.6800000000001
a little short of three years

836.56 --> 839.8389999999999
so that would be in like

840.399 --> 848.6
what's it january or february of 2004 uh

845.6 --> 848.6
2024.

849.92 --> 852.16
right

853.839 --> 857.839
don't know if i'm gonna make it that far

855.6 --> 857.839
i

861.44 --> 867.44
my finances would really have to grow

865.04 --> 868.16
because

867.44 --> 871.839
i

868.16 --> 871.8389999999999
there's many things i want to do

873.44 --> 876.8800000000001
and

874.639 --> 878.48
yeah even though i'm stable which is

876.88 --> 880.8
already

878.48 --> 883.44
well more than i expected really

880.8 --> 883.4399999999999
originally

883.68 --> 889.04
it's not like oh look at this month oh

886.8 --> 890.8
look at what i just got now oh look at

889.04 --> 893.199
what i just got now look what it just

890.8 --> 895.68
got now right how many times does that

893.199 --> 899.12
happen on my show

895.68 --> 900.959
it extremely rarely does and i see other

899.12 --> 903.68
people and their shows and they

900.959 --> 907.04
constantly have new stuff

903.68 --> 907.04
nathan oakley

908.399 --> 911.399
jaren

912.32 --> 918.0
eraser even

915.199 --> 920.16
almost everybody gets new stuff all the

918.0 --> 923.04
time

920.16 --> 925.199
me not so much i still don't even really

923.04 --> 926.959
have my air filter

925.199 --> 929.76
even though i tried to get finances

926.959 --> 929.76
together for it

935.04 --> 939.12
so yeah whatever's gonna happen

937.36 --> 941.92
in the coming period

939.12 --> 944.24
i really want growth and not number

941.92 --> 947.519
growth

944.24 --> 948.9590000000001
i'd like more great participants in chat

947.519 --> 952.079
of course

948.959 --> 954.2399999999999
and but yeah there needs to be some kind

952.079 --> 955.92
of a financial growth and it doesn't

954.24 --> 958.5600000000001
mean that i want the people that are

955.92 --> 961.8389999999999
already helping out to squeeze them even

958.56 --> 964.079
more and i don't see that as a viable

961.839 --> 966.24
option

964.079 --> 966.2399999999999
but

966.72 --> 971.0400000000001
i need growth

968.8 --> 974.079
i really really do

971.04 --> 975.8389999999999
i must have it i cannot just sit another

974.079 --> 978.7199999999999
three years

975.839 --> 980.5600000000001
just getting by financially that's

978.72 --> 983.839
not an option

980.56 --> 983.8389999999999
it's not an option

985.36 --> 990.88
ah anyway

987.6 --> 990.88
what are you guys talking about

992.079 --> 996.959
this is a net negative what does that

994.32 --> 1001.399
even mean there comes a

996.959 --> 1001.399
hello professor phil bell

1012.72 --> 1016.9590000000001
did you use oh really so

1015.44 --> 1019.2790000000001
clearly

1016.959 --> 1023.3599999999999
how many people have you heard of that

1019.279 --> 1026.16
were a jesuit that stopped being one

1023.36 --> 1027.919
tell me how that works

1026.16 --> 1030.88
why don't you

1027.919 --> 1032.16
seems like kind of a silly question

1030.88 --> 1035.1200000000001
used to be

1032.16 --> 1036.72
a jesuit or really you know anybody that

1035.12 --> 1039.839
stopped being one

1036.72 --> 1039.839
when they were one

1050.799 --> 1053.36
x just

1054.08 --> 1057.52
how how does that work out

1059.28 --> 1064.76
are asking are you serious is that a

1061.44 --> 1064.76
real thing

1066.08 --> 1070.8799999999999
i was always under the impression that

1067.76 --> 1073.28
once you become recruited as a jesuit

1070.88 --> 1075.2800000000002
you're one for life

1073.28 --> 1079.48
i might be mistaken though but that's

1075.28 --> 1079.48
the impression that i got

1081.2 --> 1085.6000000000001
no

1083.039 --> 1088.8799999999999
what do you mean no no as in you just

1085.6 --> 1088.8799999999999
said that as a joke

1093.679 --> 1099.919
totally kidding all right all right good

1096.88 --> 1099.919
i thought i was just

1100.0 --> 1103.44
weirdly mistaken maybe you know i do

1102.4 --> 1105.919
sometimes

1103.44 --> 1108.64
sometimes i have impressions and

1105.919 --> 1111.919
things that i think are very solid and i

1108.64 --> 1113.6000000000001
have them for like 30 years in my mind

1111.919 --> 1115.039
and then like at a certain moment it's

1113.6 --> 1116.0
just like yeah it's always like this

1115.039 --> 1116.72
right

1116.0 --> 1117.76
no

1116.72 --> 1118.64
what

1117.76 --> 1120.72
oh

1118.64 --> 1124.88
okay

1120.72 --> 1124.88
but in this case i guess i was right

1128.88 --> 1131.88
anyway

1141.039 --> 1145.8799999999999
hey amanda young good to see you

1150.96 --> 1155.28
he told don that he used to be just

1156.08 --> 1158.96
that's hilarious

1160.64 --> 1164.5590000000002
to me that sounds like yeah i used to be

1162.96 --> 1167.6000000000001
the pope man

1164.559 --> 1169.12
but then i got better

1167.6 --> 1172.559
i don't know

1169.12 --> 1172.559
just what it sounds like to me

1172.799 --> 1176.84
hey nathan oakley 1980

1185.6 --> 1189.1599999999999
return to normal

1199.12 --> 1201.36
ah

1205.6 --> 1211.52
right so nathan great show yesterday

1209.039 --> 1215.039
i was really annoyed yesterday overall

1211.52 --> 1217.52
and you know you found out when

1215.039 --> 1222.559
i really wanted to speak up

1217.52 --> 1222.559
and you chose to actually bark at me

1222.799 --> 1227.9189999999999
for bad timing effectively and i was

1225.679 --> 1231.52
just

1227.919 --> 1233.8400000000001
really fed up with that [ __ ]

1231.52 --> 1236.559
but i'm glad i was able to

1233.84 --> 1240.1589999999999
get back in on adam's recommendation

1236.559 --> 1240.1589999999999
because i really wasn't going to

1241.36 --> 1245.0
and make my point

1252.64 --> 1257.2800000000002
sorry dana that's

1254.799 --> 1257.28
i don't know

1257.679 --> 1262.4
i mean it i was being

1260.24 --> 1263.919
kind of interruptive i was a little over

1262.4 --> 1266.799
eager to

1263.919 --> 1266.7990000000002
bring my input

1268.4 --> 1273.44
so i wanted to say sorry you don't

1271.039 --> 1276.799
really have to

1273.44 --> 1278.4
although i don't like being addressed

1276.799 --> 1280.799
like that during the show when the

1278.4 --> 1281.76
tension's high i don't like it

1280.799 --> 1285.2
but

1281.76 --> 1287.44
yeah my overreaction really was my issue

1285.2 --> 1289.76
because i was just really agitated

1287.44 --> 1291.039
yesterday overall i was just

1289.76 --> 1293.52
tense

1291.039 --> 1293.52
cramped

1294.0 --> 1296.799
had a lot of sensation of feeling

1295.679 --> 1299.2800000000002
trapped

1296.799 --> 1300.799
so in a way i wanted to just

1299.28 --> 1301.9189999999999
shout

1300.799 --> 1304.559
loud

1301.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
but it's like yeah there's two girls

1304.559 --> 1308.08
right there

1305.84 --> 1310.24
one was even with her mother like that's

1308.08 --> 1311.6789999999999
not a good time to start yelling on the

1310.24 --> 1313.36
top of your lungs if you know what i

1311.679 --> 1314.5590000000002
mean

1313.36 --> 1316.84
this is

1314.559 --> 1320.6399999999999
didn't make it to the recorded ah

1316.84 --> 1320.6399999999999
good thank you for that

1329.039 --> 1332.84
i appreciate that

1332.96 --> 1336.24
i was actually gonna ask you if you

1334.88 --> 1338.4
would like

1336.24 --> 1339.52
cut it out

1338.4 --> 1342.4
because it would have been pretty

1339.52 --> 1346.0
ridiculous to leave it in after i just

1342.4 --> 1348.159
get back in there five minutes later

1346.0 --> 1350.799
right

1348.159 --> 1353.2
hello anger management

1350.799 --> 1354.6399999999999
oh it's so creative a name you're so

1353.2 --> 1356.96
creative

1354.64 --> 1358.5590000000002
oh did you just come up with that

1356.96 --> 1362.32
because i said it

1358.559 --> 1362.32
and it's so creative of you

1364.4 --> 1369.44
you're so special

1366.48 --> 1371.52
you're so smart for very quickly making

1369.44 --> 1374.159
a sock name based on something i just

1371.52 --> 1377.039
said that's just you're so smart man

1374.159 --> 1380.64
you're so smart must be really proud of

1377.039 --> 1380.64
how quick and witty you are

1383.28 --> 1387.799
got up on the wrong side yesterday

1388.24 --> 1393.1200000000001
huh no oh you're just actually calling

1390.96 --> 1397.48
yourself anger management well you've

1393.12 --> 1397.4799999999998
got a great timing if you do

1404.24 --> 1411.799
okay see ya

1405.679 --> 1411.799
okay well in that case yeah see ya bye

1423.36 --> 1428.4799999999998
yeah

1425.039 --> 1429.679
if i'm gonna mistake you for a sock name

1428.48 --> 1432.88
ah

1429.679 --> 1436.0800000000002
and i lay it out exactly why

1432.88 --> 1438.7990000000002
and you're then outraged oh i'm not a

1436.08 --> 1440.559
soccer coach well i'm gonna leave now

1438.799 --> 1441.6
okay that means you're a [ __ ] troll

1440.559 --> 1442.72
anyway

1441.6 --> 1445.7199999999998
right

1442.72 --> 1445.72
so

1449.12 --> 1452.7199999999998
yeah i get trolls here

1451.36 --> 1454.559
if you're gonna get in here and i

1452.72 --> 1457.279
accidentally mistake you for troll and

1454.559 --> 1461.12
this wouldn't be the first time

1457.279 --> 1462.64
then don't act like a gamma

1461.12 --> 1466.3999999999999
all right

1462.64 --> 1468.48
just say hey i'm not a troll really

1466.4 --> 1470.88
and things will be alright if you're

1468.48 --> 1472.72
going to act like that then you become

1470.88 --> 1475.679
the troll even though you might not have

1472.72 --> 1478.0
been the troll and then i will ban you

1475.679 --> 1480.0
right that's how things work here

1478.0 --> 1482.08
there's been plenty of people getting in

1480.0 --> 1486.08
here

1482.08 --> 1490.6399999999999
that still hang around to this day

1486.08 --> 1490.6399999999999
who i thought originally were trolls

1491.919 --> 1496.0
that's just how it works

1494.0 --> 1499.0
can't deal with that then get the [ __ ]

1496.0 --> 1499.0
out

1504.48 --> 1509.82

nothing i can do about it at this time

1568.559 --> 1573.36
oh wait i could put in a filter perhaps

1581.2 --> 1584.52
let's see

1586.0 --> 1590.52
i'll put in the filter for a second

1592.13 --> 1601.0390000000002
[Music]

1599.36 --> 1602.4799999999998

yeah i am a little bit a little bit

1629.76 --> 1633.679
shocked i made it this far this far

1634.559 --> 1637.2
i made it

1638.24 --> 1641.679
i'm causing you audio chaos my skype's

1640.159 --> 1644.8400000000001
obviously not set up right i'll call you

1641.679 --> 1644.8400000000001
back again

1646.53 --> 1649.7
[Music]

1661.2 --> 1664.919
on the noise gate

1675.52 --> 1678.52
26.

1691.679 --> 1694.159
content

1693.2 --> 1696.799
show

1694.159 --> 1698.24
is great talk about it

1696.799 --> 1699.279
talk about my

1698.24 --> 1700.799
life

1699.279 --> 1703.039
to a detail

1700.799 --> 1705.6399999999999
that makes trolls create

1703.039 --> 1707.36
because they cannot face

1705.64 --> 1710.96
simplicities

1707.36 --> 1714.6399999999999
of honest self-confrontation

1710.96 --> 1714.64
but yeah that does

1718.159 --> 1720.3990000000001
and

1721.679 --> 1726.799
how to

1723.52 --> 1731.039
fix problems and obstacles personal

1726.799 --> 1733.44
often emotional obstacles on life

1731.039 --> 1736.72
giving them here

1733.44 --> 1739.679
an adulterated perspective to personally

1736.72 --> 1742.3990000000001
deal with something in your life

1739.679 --> 1745.44
without some extra

1742.399 --> 1748.32
thing i roll on top of it to manipulate

1745.44 --> 1750.64
you to kind of get you to do something

1748.32 --> 1750.6399999999999
yeah

1750.96 --> 1754.88
that part

1752.559 --> 1754.8799999999999
out

1764.48 --> 1768.88
take filter off

1766.559 --> 1768.8799999999999
why

1776.159 --> 1780.96
probably the filter what are you talking

1778.0 --> 1783.919
about the filter is a noise gate

1780.96 --> 1787.52
it just cuts off the sound when it goes

1783.919 --> 1787.5200000000002
below a certain level that's it

1787.919 --> 1791.7990000000002
turn it off fine

1804.159 --> 1808.44
all right so it's back to normal

1813.44 --> 1817.3600000000001
sound shouldn't be cutting out anymore

1817.6 --> 1822.52
hey clutch where did your bear go

1826.88 --> 1830.88
how did you why did you earn bear

1832.159 --> 1837.0800000000002
hello tony whitcomb good to see you

1840.54 --> 1844.27
[Music]

1846.159 --> 1849.1200000000001
hello

1847.76 --> 1850.64
is that any better or am i causing an

1849.12 --> 1851.9189999999999
audio chaos still

1850.64 --> 1854.0
i don't know

1851.919 --> 1856.3200000000002
yeah i'm still having echoes

1854.0 --> 1858.159
still causing chaos

1856.32 --> 1859.36
i don't know it's just echo

1858.159 --> 1862.24
but not

1859.36 --> 1865.519
you don't give echoes i only hear my

1862.24 --> 1867.1200000000001
echoes so oh okay that's bloody useless

1865.519 --> 1868.799
isn't it okay i'll give up on talking to

1867.12 --> 1869.76
you on your show on screen

1868.799 --> 1871.84
sorry

1869.76 --> 1874.0
thanks for trying though it's a good try

1871.84 --> 1875.84
somebody on for a sec

1874.0 --> 1879.84
i'll see you on your show

1875.84 --> 1879.84
okay bye all right later

1882.399 --> 1887.039
wow

1884.559 --> 1887.039
okay

1889.44 --> 1894.0800000000002
that's kind of odd skype wasn't giving

1892.08 --> 1895.76
that sort of issue while back when i

1894.08 --> 1899.72
last tried it

1895.76 --> 1899.72
don't know why that's happening

1908.96 --> 1913.039
i didn't mean to was trying to fix what

1912.0 --> 1916.559
show

1913.039 --> 1919.72
in my email oh okay

1916.559 --> 1919.72
all right

1932.88 --> 1937.3600000000001
strange to hear somebody else on my show

1937.679 --> 1943.039
especially at the start of the early

1940.08 --> 1948.12
bird series i had a lot of people on

1943.039 --> 1948.12
i that was kind of the original intent

1954.88 --> 1958.64
don't address the trolls

1959.2 --> 1964.559
if you address the trolls i'm gonna mark

1961.6 --> 1964.559
you as a troll

1964.799 --> 1969.279
no more stupid names

1966.88 --> 1971.3600000000001
no more trollish names and then trying

1969.279 --> 1973.12
to act like you're a normal person you

1971.36 --> 1975.519
have a stupid annoying name i'm gonna

1973.12 --> 1976.6399999999999
ban you all right i don't think it's

1975.519 --> 1979.84
funny

1976.64 --> 1981.519
why didn't you just name yourself

1979.84 --> 1986.519
something that actually has to do with

1981.519 --> 1986.519
who you are as a person how about that

2010.559 --> 2013.559
so

2018.559 --> 2024.559
that's right pj khrushchev

2021.279 --> 2024.559
had plenty of people on

2025.76 --> 2032.96
but i also used to do that because i

2029.6 --> 2034.799
felt like i didn't i wanted to discuss

2032.96 --> 2036.88
things with people

2034.799 --> 2038.72
like online

2036.88 --> 2041.1200000000001
on my show

2038.72 --> 2043.279
and not on nathan's because at the time

2041.12 --> 2045.6789999999999
especially back then

2043.279 --> 2047.36
nathan was just the show was always very

2045.679 --> 2049.6
crowded it was hard to get in between

2047.36 --> 2049.6
there

2050.72 --> 2055.399
oh okay yeah get out of here

2079.119 --> 2083.359
yeah bad karma dislike is great ratio is

2081.919 --> 2085.919
crazy but

2083.359 --> 2088.0
it's because it's a thousand episode and

2085.919 --> 2089.679
they like to do that i've already gave

2088.0 --> 2093.119
them a challenge if you can get my

2089.679 --> 2094.96
downvotes to minus one thousand

2093.119 --> 2097.359
during a live show i'll show it on

2094.96 --> 2097.359
screen

2099.68 --> 2106.16
it gives them something to do

2103.44 --> 2109.04
have some temporary sensation that their

2106.16 --> 2110.72
life has any meaning

2109.04 --> 2112.72
you know

2110.72 --> 2116.839
because you gotta go for something even

2112.72 --> 2116.839
if it's completely useless

2132.49 --> 2137.1189999999997
[Music]

2134.88 --> 2139.359
right

2137.119 --> 2142.2400000000002
but let's not end up talking about them

2139.359 --> 2145.44
because then we we actually give up

2142.24 --> 2149.1189999999997
pieces of our life to them right best

2145.44 --> 2152.56
way to deal with trolls is just

2149.119 --> 2155.119
out of there and out of your mind

2152.56 --> 2156.72
not a second not a consideration not a

2155.119 --> 2159.839
glimpse

2156.72 --> 2162.3199999999997
don't even laugh if something about

2159.839 --> 2164.0
their name is funny in any sort of way

2162.32 --> 2167.3590000000004
just nothing

2164.0 --> 2171.48
nothing just get out immediately out of

2167.359 --> 2171.48
your mind out of the chat

2175.839 --> 2182.44
can you discuss about your views about

2178.4 --> 2182.44
gravity oh [ __ ]

2188.24 --> 2192.4799999999996
well

2189.92 --> 2194.96
to be honest it hasn't really evolved

2192.48 --> 2196.56
all that much ah there you go

2194.96 --> 2198.839
now let's come back get the [ __ ] out of

2196.56 --> 2200.4
here [ __ ]

2198.839 --> 2202.56
right

2200.4 --> 2204.1600000000003
my view on gravity hasn't really changed

2202.56 --> 2206.32
all that much

2204.16 --> 2207.359
since the early bird show

2206.32 --> 2209.52
the most

2207.359 --> 2211.839
part the part where i discussed it the

2209.52 --> 2215.24
most was still during the flat earth

2211.839 --> 2215.24
talks days

2216.16 --> 2218.3999999999996
right

2218.56 --> 2223.7599999999998
and during that time i was very occupied

2221.92 --> 2227.599
with discussing it with

2223.76 --> 2231.8390000000004
riley and qe came on the scene and

2227.599 --> 2234.32
was trying to get some kind of a

2231.839 --> 2236.56
conception of gravity that would that

2234.32 --> 2239.52
would work in my mind

2236.56 --> 2241.68
but then yeah just the more time passed

2239.52 --> 2244.24
the more it became very obvious gravity

2241.68 --> 2246.56
is an aberration that's how i named it

2244.24 --> 2248.3999999999996
and i pretty much rounded it out with

2246.56 --> 2250.48
that after that point i have not

2248.4 --> 2252.8
entertained gravity

2250.48 --> 2252.8
ever

2253.2 --> 2257.7599999999998
there's no need for it it's just

2255.2 --> 2259.9199999999996
relative density it's only relative

2257.76 --> 2261.8390000000004
density oh that doesn't explain some

2259.92 --> 2263.92
things well that's too [ __ ] bad

2261.839 --> 2265.92
because it's only relative density and i

2263.92 --> 2269.2000000000003
don't care why

2265.92 --> 2273.04
i just care what and how

2269.2 --> 2276.5989999999997
yeah what and how i don't care why

2273.04 --> 2276.599
what and how

2284.72 --> 2288.56
uh james base when you were kid you did

2286.8 --> 2291.599
phony phone calls

2288.56 --> 2293.599
i did that too a couple of times

2291.599 --> 2296.839
and it was really lame and it always

2293.599 --> 2300.56
made me feel kind of like

2296.839 --> 2300.56
stupid annoying

2301.28 --> 2306.4
right in your mind it it it seems like

2303.839 --> 2307.68
it's funny but yeah i'm very sensitive

2306.4 --> 2310.8
person

2307.68 --> 2310.7999999999997
so i get

2311.839 --> 2315.2
like

2312.72 --> 2317.2799999999997
i can feel how annoying it is to a

2315.2 --> 2319.7599999999998
person like you could potentially ruin

2317.28 --> 2322.5600000000004
somebody's day with that

2319.76 --> 2322.5600000000004
out of nowhere

2324.079 --> 2329.04
so i didn't really hold on to doing that

2327.119 --> 2332.7200000000003
but i did try it at some time like when

2329.04 --> 2335.119
i was 14 or 13.

2332.72 --> 2339.0
it was just lame it was lame back then

2335.119 --> 2339.0
and it's lame right now

2341.359 --> 2345.04
hey good servant good to see you

2351.599 --> 2357.3590000000004
right but how my views on gravity evolve

2357.599 --> 2361.44
well i figured out

2359.28 --> 2364.4
much more

2361.44 --> 2366.4
besides gravity besides thinking about

2364.4 --> 2367.76
the idea of gravity the concept of

2366.4 --> 2370.4
gravity

2367.76 --> 2372.4
i've evolved a lot more like for example

2370.4 --> 2373.76
why is there a gradient

2372.4 --> 2375.6800000000003
why is it here

2373.76 --> 2379.5200000000004
in the realm

2375.68 --> 2379.52
due to temperature influences

2379.839 --> 2382.839
and

2384.32 --> 2387.599
cleared up more

2388.24 --> 2393.04
evidence

2390.16 --> 2396.48
that could be sought in how the gravity

2393.04 --> 2400.4
conception the con the concept of it is

2396.48 --> 2400.4
completely illegitimate

2401.2 --> 2408.2799999999997
although i think i already had most of

2403.359 --> 2408.2799999999997
that in my mind before that time

2414.24 --> 2418.24
yeah thank you by the way good servant

2415.839 --> 2421.96
for the two dollar super chat donation

2418.24 --> 2421.9599999999996
thousand shows indeed

2425.359 --> 2429.2799999999997
all right

2426.56 --> 2430.64
so yeah gravity what is it even supposed

2429.28 --> 2432.96
to be

2430.64 --> 2432.96
you know

2433.119 --> 2439.359
well in people's minds it's pretty much

2435.599 --> 2441.119
still newtonian gravity

2439.359 --> 2443.44
even though officially it's not that

2441.119 --> 2445.44
anymore but hey everybody's

2443.44 --> 2448.48
just

2445.44 --> 2450.2400000000002
allowed to think of it like that anyway

2448.48 --> 2453.68
nobody seems to really care in an

2450.24 --> 2455.68
academic world can think of newtonian

2453.68 --> 2457.68
gravity as much as you like they don't

2455.68 --> 2460.24
really care about it

2457.68 --> 2464.3999999999996
doesn't have any relevance to anything

2460.24 --> 2464.3999999999996
right they just let people do that

2464.96 --> 2470.64
an einstein gravity is just completely

2467.76 --> 2473.3590000000004
useless it's literally just a bunch of

2470.64 --> 2475.68
mathematical extrapolated garbage that

2473.359 --> 2478.48
cannot be proven and doesn't help

2475.68 --> 2480.72
anything in any way

2478.48 --> 2483.76
it only serves to make things more

2480.72 --> 2485.2
confusing to those who

2483.76 --> 2486.88
overlook

2485.2 --> 2489.04
what it really is

2486.88 --> 2491.04
which is mathematical extrapolations

2489.04 --> 2494.56
that don't lead to anything

2491.04 --> 2496.319
right it's designed to make people

2494.56 --> 2500.16
believe like wow this sounds so

2496.319 --> 2500.16
complicated i don't get it i'll just

2500.24 --> 2504.9599999999996
see it as like oh dude yeah einstein

2502.64 --> 2507.1189999999997
gravity that's the gravity but i don't

2504.96 --> 2509.839
get it

2507.119 --> 2509.839
that's the trick

2510.72 --> 2515.359
that newtonian gravity like even if you

2513.2 --> 2518.16
entertain the thought is completely

2515.359 --> 2519.359
broken it's so incomplete in so many

2518.16 --> 2521.359
ways

2519.359 --> 2523.92
like just take a look at the solar

2521.359 --> 2526.48
system for starters right it's also a

2523.92 --> 2528.56
nice and cute solar system

2526.48 --> 2532.2400000000002
imagining the balls

2528.56 --> 2534.88
spinning around that big sun bowl

2532.24 --> 2536.72
but yeah

2534.88 --> 2537.52
don't know if anybody has picked up on

2536.72 --> 2539.52
it

2537.52 --> 2542.319
we talked about it quite a few times

2539.52 --> 2545.44
even on the flat earth debate show

2542.319 --> 2548.64
but yeah gravity

2545.44 --> 2551.92
newtonian gravity was originally used to

2548.64 --> 2554.56
build the solar system mechanism to

2551.92 --> 2557.04
balance out the well in that that case

2554.56 --> 2560.0789999999997
newtonian forces

2557.04 --> 2561.2799999999997
to make all the balls attract and spin

2560.079 --> 2563.2400000000002
and

2561.28 --> 2565.52
balance it out right and that worked

2563.24 --> 2568.56
miraculously well

2565.52 --> 2570.72
except for mercury

2568.56 --> 2573.52
which in the modeling they have to

2570.72 --> 2576.0789999999997
completely pick it out like it doesn't

2573.52 --> 2577.28
exist in order to make everything else

2576.079 --> 2580.0
work

2577.28 --> 2582.2400000000002
but yeah since mercury is still there

2580.0 --> 2585.28
officially and visually

2582.24 --> 2587.52
they just edit it in afterward like a

2585.28 --> 2591.0400000000004
cosmetic procedure and then they say

2587.52 --> 2593.92
yeah that's einstein gravity

2591.04 --> 2596.64
just like a separated

2593.92 --> 2599.839
mutation

2596.64 --> 2602.0789999999997
on top of the newtonian model

2599.839 --> 2602.0789999999997
right

2602.72 --> 2608.64
so yeah the newtonian model was always

2605.92 --> 2613.04
kind of broken in a way that could never

2608.64 --> 2613.04
be fixed within its model

2614.96 --> 2618.2400000000002
that's just one element

2617.2 --> 2620.319
right

2618.24 --> 2622.3999999999996
let alone the knowledge we have over

2620.319 --> 2625.52
newtonian gravity that it basically

2622.4 --> 2627.76
attributes mass to everything and then

2625.52 --> 2630.88
the mass is subjected to

2627.76 --> 2634.079
the pull of gravity over distance

2630.88 --> 2636.7200000000003
newtonian gravity that's the idea but in

2634.079 --> 2636.7200000000003
reality

2636.96 --> 2643.839
oh get the hell out of here scumbag

2640.8 --> 2643.8390000000004
but in reality

2646.56 --> 2650.7999999999997
there is no

2649.119 --> 2652.56
distant attraction there is no

2650.8 --> 2656.2400000000002
measurable

2652.56 --> 2656.24
force that works like that

2656.56 --> 2661.359
it's just relative density and

2659.359 --> 2662.96
like according to the newtonian

2661.359 --> 2665.52
mechanics idea

2662.96 --> 2667.28
gravity would be decreasing

2665.52 --> 2670.56
the higher up you go

2667.28 --> 2672.96
that doesn't really happen at all

2670.56 --> 2674.72
it's always constant it's a constant

2672.96 --> 2676.96
it's a constant everywhere and it

2674.72 --> 2679.04
doesn't decrease

2676.96 --> 2681.44
after a set distance

2679.04 --> 2684.4
even though it should

2681.44 --> 2687.359
it should in order for the concept of

2684.4 --> 2689.28
orbiting to work

2687.359 --> 2692.319
but it doesn't

2689.28 --> 2694.2400000000002
it doesn't do that at all it doesn't the

2692.319 --> 2696.64
falling speed

2694.24 --> 2697.9199999999996
the acceleration rate as they like to

2696.64 --> 2699.44
attribute

2697.92 --> 2701.92
to gravity

2699.44 --> 2704.96
it doesn't decrease

2701.92 --> 2707.2000000000003
if you go up higher no matter how high

2704.96 --> 2710.079
up you go it doesn't decrease it never

2707.2 --> 2712.16
decreases it always stays the same it's

2710.079 --> 2714.48
a constant

2712.16 --> 2716.839
right

2714.48 --> 2720.88
and then oh yeah i almost

2716.839 --> 2722.4
forgot newtonian gravity mass that's how

2720.88 --> 2726.0
it works

2722.4 --> 2730.319
but gases don't have mass mass is an

2726.0 --> 2730.319
extrapolated concept based on

2730.839 --> 2735.359
density and it doesn't

2733.28 --> 2738.079
work on gases

2735.359 --> 2740.24
gases effectively don't have mass they

2738.079 --> 2743.04
have a density but they don't have a

2740.24 --> 2745.68
mass they're not susceptible to momentum

2743.04 --> 2747.839
in order for them to be

2745.68 --> 2748.64
affected

2747.839 --> 2750.56
by

2748.64 --> 2752.64
the forces

2750.56 --> 2754.7999999999997
only force gases

2752.64 --> 2756.0
respond to in their gaseous state right

2754.8 --> 2758.48
i'm not talking like

2756.0 --> 2760.56
but this gas in liquid form does things

2758.48 --> 2763.68
yeah that's super cute but we're talking

2760.56 --> 2767.44
about gases and not liquids yeah gases

2763.68 --> 2767.44
are not susceptible by momentum

2767.52 --> 2772.96
they just respond to local

2770.56 --> 2776.96
gas pressure differential and then they

2772.96 --> 2778.96
immediately equalize it

2776.96 --> 2781.599
they move and they equalize with their

2778.96 --> 2781.599
surroundings

2781.92 --> 2786.48
they don't

2783.359 --> 2789.839
you can't set gas in motion

2786.48 --> 2792.4
within a stabilized pressurized system

2789.839 --> 2794.48
and that it will continue moving it

2792.4 --> 2797.44
won't continue moving it doesn't have

2794.48 --> 2799.92
momentum it just immediately spreads out

2797.44 --> 2802.56
and equalizes the pressure

2799.92 --> 2805.44
in wherever it is it doesn't care what

2802.56 --> 2805.44
moves through it

2808.16 --> 2813.52
that's it so there is no gravity

2811.119 --> 2814.839
newtonian gravity and

2813.52 --> 2817.7599999999998
einsteinian

2814.839 --> 2821.599
gravity people can't even apply that to

2817.76 --> 2825.599
physical reality in any sort of way

2821.599 --> 2825.599
so that's just completely irrelevant

2826.0 --> 2830.079
so there you go that's

2828.079 --> 2833.6800000000003
what i've learned about gravity i've

2830.079 --> 2837.92
learned a lot about it a lot

2833.68 --> 2837.9199999999996
i could teach this stuff in school

2839.68 --> 2845.24
i am effectively qualified at teaching

2842.0 --> 2845.24
about gravity

2849.04 --> 2855.72
hey miss crazy good to see you

2851.92 --> 2855.7200000000003
dumb jazza also

2858.319 --> 2863.599
no gas does not have mass and density

2860.8 --> 2864.88
gas has density gas does not have mass

2863.599 --> 2867.839
you're wrong

2864.88 --> 2867.839
or you're a liar

2868.96 --> 2872.359
day 4g

2876.0 --> 2881.52
unless there's a container yeah but

2877.92 --> 2884.48
there is no example of no container agm

2881.52 --> 2886.72
the concept of no container is a concept

2884.48 --> 2888.319
it doesn't actually exist in reality

2886.72 --> 2891.2
there is no

2888.319 --> 2891.2
non-container

2893.04 --> 2896.96
no it doesn't

2894.559 --> 2896.96
get out

2898.559 --> 2903.6800000000003
there's no there will be no chanting in

2900.559 --> 2905.76
chat today fundies

2903.68 --> 2908.16
yeah don't give it attention cleary

2905.76 --> 2911.119
don't give it attention this is not a

2908.16 --> 2913.1189999999997
troll show today okay

2911.119 --> 2916.319
this is not a troll show i'm not gonna

2913.119 --> 2918.96
fill it whining about oh true so look at

2916.319 --> 2921.599
the truth and [ __ ] the trolls just ban

2918.96 --> 2924.8
them do not give them a second of

2921.599 --> 2926.6400000000003
attention i demand it from you

2924.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
all right

2926.64 --> 2929.839
not a second

2939.04 --> 2943.599
don't care about the thumbs down or

2940.8 --> 2946.7200000000003
thumbs up don't care don't address it

2943.599 --> 2948.88
not a second of your attention am i

2946.72 --> 2951.68
getting through to you chat

2948.88 --> 2953.44
yeah ask and receive

2951.68 --> 2956.8799999999997
pj kruschenk

2953.44 --> 2958.96
all of you all of you not a second of

2956.88 --> 2961.599
attention not a second

2958.96 --> 2965.359
do not want you addressing anything

2961.599 --> 2966.88
troll related in chat only ban only

2965.359 --> 2970.2799999999997
all right

2966.88 --> 2970.28
and that's today

2973.52 --> 2977.28
no you don't i'll ban them don't worry

2975.839 --> 2978.48
about it

2977.28 --> 2982.4
just

2978.48 --> 2984.4
try to keep your attention at class

2982.4 --> 2986.7200000000003
we're talking about gravity i just laid

2984.4 --> 2986.7200000000003
it out

2989.68 --> 2993.2
what i've learned about gravity

2993.68 --> 2997.9199999999996
in the last three years

2995.76 --> 2999.44
and this is where i'm at if i got any

2997.92 --> 3002.319
more questions

2999.44 --> 3004.7200000000003
about it did i miss anything in your

3002.319 --> 3004.72
opinion

3009.2 --> 3012.0
that's right ask and receive but that's

3010.72 --> 3013.5989999999997
exactly what they're trying to do i

3012.0 --> 3016.599
don't want it i'm not tolerating it

3013.599 --> 3016.599
anymore

3028.4 --> 3033.04
right yeah that's right i explained

3030.16 --> 3035.68
about the mass mass is an extrapolated

3033.04 --> 3035.68
concept

3036.48 --> 3041.599
and gas does not have mass it has a

3039.599 --> 3042.7200000000003
density and that's the only thing it has

3041.599 --> 3045.2000000000003
mass

3042.72 --> 3047.839
only works

3045.2 --> 3049.04
if it is a liquid or solid

3047.839 --> 3052.0
yeah

3049.04 --> 3056.16
that molecular substance

3052.0 --> 3057.68
or an atom type in the

3056.16 --> 3060.319
call again

3057.68 --> 3060.319
in the list

3061.92 --> 3066.64
in the periodic table

3063.92 --> 3070.319
yeah it might have a registered mass

3066.64 --> 3073.68
but that's because it's not specified

3070.319 --> 3076.16
what the molecular state is

3073.68 --> 3078.0
it doesn't specify whether it's liquid

3076.16 --> 3081.52
solid gas

3078.0 --> 3084.4
in that notification and that mass only

3081.52 --> 3086.559
counts when it's in a non-gaseous state

3084.4 --> 3089.04
yeah then it does have a mass

3086.559 --> 3091.6800000000003
extrapolated from its density

3089.04 --> 3094.319
but it will always have a density though

3091.68 --> 3096.72
all material have density

3094.319 --> 3101.119
not all materials have mass

3096.72 --> 3102.48
because gases do not have mass

3101.119 --> 3106.7200000000003
doesn't work

3102.48 --> 3106.72
mass is a very specific thing

3107.92 --> 3114.88
not finding even the right words

3111.599 --> 3116.559
i call it susceptible to momentum

3114.88 --> 3119.52
there's other words for it other

3116.559 --> 3121.8390000000004
descriptions that also abide

3119.52 --> 3124.4
i i can't

3121.839 --> 3126.48
conjure them in my mind right now but

3124.4 --> 3128.88
yeah

3126.48 --> 3131.76
not susceptible to momentum is good

3128.88 --> 3136.0
enough must have mass no no

3131.76 --> 3137.76
loose elastic no that's wrong

3136.0 --> 3140.72
you don't have to have mass to have

3137.76 --> 3143.92
density it's the other way around

3140.72 --> 3144.9599999999996
and by the way all material have density

3143.92 --> 3146.96
all

3144.96 --> 3149.52
if it's doesn't have density it's not a

3146.96 --> 3152.559
material it is nothing it's just the

3149.52 --> 3155.44
evacuation of something

3152.559 --> 3158.96
but no mass is an extrapolated concept

3155.44 --> 3161.52
and gases do not have it

3158.96 --> 3163.52
material in gaseous state does not have

3161.52 --> 3167.48
mass

3163.52 --> 3167.48
only has a density

3180.16 --> 3182.3999999999996
what

3183.76 --> 3186.88
really

3185.2 --> 3190.0789999999997
to talk about something that happened

3186.88 --> 3190.079
like three years ago

3193.599 --> 3200.1600000000003
why did she leave because

3197.28 --> 3202.8
patricia had hoped that literally all

3200.16 --> 3205.5989999999997
flat earthers would unify

3202.8 --> 3208.319
like a united spiritual front that's

3205.599 --> 3210.319
really what she hoped for

3208.319 --> 3212.079
there was no dark intentions behind it

3210.319 --> 3214.88
that's what she wanted that's what she

3212.079 --> 3216.8
needed and that's what she didn't get

3214.88 --> 3218.4
because there was infighting and there

3216.8 --> 3220.559
probably always will be in fighting

3218.4 --> 3222.48
because there's just groups

3220.559 --> 3226.2400000000002
that start to

3222.48 --> 3230.079
assimilate agendas within what they do

3226.24 --> 3231.839
and that's probably gonna happen forever

3230.079 --> 3234.4
it's never gonna be a united front there

3231.839 --> 3237.599
will always be people

3234.4 --> 3240.8
among flat earthers that are gonna form

3237.599 --> 3242.88
their own little empires and then attack

3240.8 --> 3245.599
everyone else

3242.88 --> 3247.92
especially when they address

3245.599 --> 3250.6400000000003
their little niche projects and point

3247.92 --> 3253.52
out fallacies they're just gonna attack

3250.64 --> 3256.319
attack attack attack

3253.52 --> 3259.44
and that's something that patricia steer

3256.319 --> 3261.92
was not willing to tolerate

3259.44 --> 3265.7200000000003
that that was going around ever

3261.92 --> 3265.7200000000003
and that's why she left

3266.16 --> 3272.16
she just couldn't handle the constant

3269.599 --> 3274.319
nastiness from people that were just

3272.16 --> 3277.7599999999998
there to

3274.319 --> 3281.44
seek out their claim

3277.76 --> 3283.119
and draw everything to themselves

3281.44 --> 3284.16
and basically try to form their own

3283.119 --> 3287.28
cults

3284.16 --> 3289.2
she didn't want to do that she didn't

3287.28 --> 3292.2400000000002
right she would have probably been fine

3289.2 --> 3294.319
even with like minor cult aspects but

3292.24 --> 3296.5589999999997
not constantly attacking other flat

3294.319 --> 3301.44
earthers because they wouldn't

3296.559 --> 3301.44
fall in line that part she didn't like

3303.28 --> 3306.6400000000003
and when i'm talking about fall in line

3305.44 --> 3308.7200000000003
is

3306.64 --> 3310.16
that's different from

3308.72 --> 3312.3999999999996
making somebody

3310.16 --> 3313.5989999999997
abide by the scientific method

3312.4 --> 3315.599
get real

3313.599 --> 3316.559
because that's something that everybody

3315.599 --> 3317.6800000000003
should

3316.559 --> 3321.119
uphold

3317.68 --> 3324.3999999999996
with everybody else at all times

3321.119 --> 3327.6800000000003
everywhere not just a flat earth scene

3324.4 --> 3327.6800000000003
or anything and everything

3328.799 --> 3331.799
right

3338.799 --> 3343.92
yeah but it's wrong aaron maverick it's

3341.839 --> 3346.16
wrong

3343.92 --> 3347.6800000000003
probably

3346.16 --> 3349.359
wrong

3347.68 --> 3351.44
yeah other people say because of

3349.359 --> 3353.7599999999998
electromagnetic oh did you know about

3351.44 --> 3356.16
electromagnetism

3353.76 --> 3358.4
do you understand what that is

3356.16 --> 3360.5589999999997
do you understand what electromagnetism

3358.4 --> 3363.359
is yeah

3360.559 --> 3366.88
let's just summarize

3363.359 --> 3366.88
it's measurable

3367.28 --> 3372.88
it decreases in strength over distance

3373.599 --> 3378.7200000000003
there is

3374.88 --> 3381.76
measurable extractable and insertable

3378.72 --> 3383.839
energy happening

3381.76 --> 3386.1600000000003
yeah

3383.839 --> 3388.48
that's not what's that's not the thing

3386.16 --> 3390.0
that's called causing relative density

3388.48 --> 3392.72
displacement relative density

3390.0 --> 3396.079
displacements happen

3392.72 --> 3399.2799999999997
way way out of reach there is no

3396.079 --> 3400.48
measurable energy causing that

3399.28 --> 3402.4
that you could

3400.48 --> 3405.44
negate

3402.4 --> 3408.079
in order for it to not

3405.44 --> 3410.7200000000003
function according to relative density

3408.079 --> 3412.88
that's not what's going on people can

3410.72 --> 3415.7599999999998
think it's electromagnetism or

3412.88 --> 3417.119
incoherent dielectric blah blah blah

3415.76 --> 3420.1600000000003
it's not

3417.119 --> 3422.6400000000003
it's not it's provably

3420.16 --> 3424.5589999999997
measurably not

3422.64 --> 3426.0789999999997
it isn't that

3424.559 --> 3428.7200000000003
cannot be that

3426.079 --> 3431.3590000000004
all of those things are measurable

3428.72 --> 3433.7599999999998
and have consequences electrostatics is

3431.359 --> 3436.0
super cute yeah i know can displace

3433.76 --> 3437.119
things like even laterally there's the

3436.0 --> 3439.28
thing though

3437.119 --> 3442.319
it has an extremely short range and

3439.28 --> 3445.119
every time you want to offset the

3442.319 --> 3446.4
density through electrostatics

3445.119 --> 3450.559
you have to have

3446.4 --> 3453.599
a landline a landline you have to have a

3450.559 --> 3456.6400000000003
physical connection you know why because

3453.599 --> 3459.04
it doesn't do that over distance

3456.64 --> 3462.64
the amount of power

3459.04 --> 3465.839
electrostatic force would have to

3462.64 --> 3468.319
have inserted to basically

3465.839 --> 3471.119
pull something in over let's say a

3468.319 --> 3472.319
kilometer distance would be so absurdly

3471.119 --> 3474.7200000000003
colossal

3472.319 --> 3476.96
it would literally just cause electric

3474.72 --> 3480.16
storms at the ground level right

3476.96 --> 3482.2400000000002
electric storms because of the intensity

3480.16 --> 3484.24
of the electrostatic energy things would

3482.24 --> 3485.839
be flying all over the place

3484.24 --> 3489.52
it would be crazy

3485.839 --> 3491.839
it cannot be that it's physically

3489.52 --> 3493.52
impossible

3491.839 --> 3497.96
doesn't matter what you think about it

3493.52 --> 3497.96
it's physically impossible

3505.68 --> 3508.68
ah

3517.359 --> 3521.04
nobody gives a [ __ ] good servant

3521.119 --> 3526.559
stupid [ __ ] rumors nobody cares

3524.079 --> 3530.1600000000003
that's just that's her axe being a

3526.559 --> 3532.6400000000003
complete piece of [ __ ] gamma

3530.16 --> 3536.0789999999997
yeah that's he started that it doesn't

3532.64 --> 3536.0789999999997
matter it's not relevant

3542.319 --> 3545.799
it's just slander

3560.319 --> 3564.16
you just reference division you mean the

3562.24 --> 3566.8799999999997
division between

3564.16 --> 3570.3999999999996
scientifically proven fact and

3566.88 --> 3572.96
delusional science fiction fantastics

3570.4 --> 3575.52
yeah i know i know it's a division i i

3572.96 --> 3579.28
wasn't pinning you down personally i was

3575.52 --> 3581.2
just addressing you bringing that up

3579.28 --> 3584.44
that's all aaron maverick don't worry

3581.2 --> 3584.4399999999996
about it

3591.68 --> 3596.96
oh well thanks nasa for that dusty

3594.559 --> 3599.119
writer oh if nasa hadn't told me i would

3596.96 --> 3600.799
have never known oh wait i did know i've

3599.119 --> 3604.319
known that

3600.799 --> 3606.72
very very very long i don't need nasa to

3604.319 --> 3611.96
tell me the basics

3606.72 --> 3611.9599999999996
of how life functions in this realm

3615.68 --> 3619.359
yeah and by the way so is oxygen

3619.68 --> 3622.3999999999996
did you know that

3626.96 --> 3631.68
there is a division within the globe

3629.119 --> 3634.0
belief uh

3631.68 --> 3634.0
what

3634.4 --> 3639.44
you mean the division between

3637.119 --> 3643.52
genuine baller believers

3639.44 --> 3645.92
and anti-flat earthers yeah

3643.52 --> 3645.92
i know

3647.2 --> 3653.68
oh it was sarcasm was it well don't do

3649.92 --> 3655.359
that just don't do sarcasm i don't want

3653.68 --> 3659.68
dry

3655.359 --> 3662.24
unhinted sarcasm in my chat

3659.68 --> 3665.68
you might have taken notice

3662.24 --> 3668.16
that i tend to not sense that

3665.68 --> 3671.2
yeah and then i'm going to respond

3668.16 --> 3673.5989999999997
literal yeah don't complain to me

3671.2 --> 3677.4399999999996
afterward oh there was sarcasm well why

3673.599 --> 3677.44
don't you [ __ ] hint at it then

3680.64 --> 3684.64
she's just gonna say something dry just

3683.44 --> 3686.4
like that

3684.64 --> 3687.839
oh it's sarcasm

3686.4 --> 3689.599
how would i know

3687.839 --> 3692.48
how would i know there's people

3689.599 --> 3694.2400000000002
literally genuinely stating that [ __ ]

3692.48 --> 3697.799
without sarcasm

3694.24 --> 3697.799
how would i know

3700.319 --> 3704.16
no cps not no sarcasm

3703.2 --> 3705.839
look

3704.16 --> 3707.839
when it's a

3705.839 --> 3710.5589999999997
verbal conversation

3707.839 --> 3713.599
auditory that's different

3710.559 --> 3716.2400000000002
because there's a lot of tones

3713.599 --> 3718.0
that come along with a sarcastic

3716.24 --> 3721.68
sentence set up

3718.0 --> 3723.76
that is not in the chat you don't hear

3721.68 --> 3727.5989999999997
that in the chat you just see what's

3723.76 --> 3729.28
read what's written down doesn't work

3727.599 --> 3732.28
don't tell me to calm down get the [ __ ]

3729.28 --> 3732.28
out

3744.559 --> 3748.799
yeah not saying no sarcasm just saying

3746.96 --> 3751.039
if you're gonna be oh i'm funny i'm

3748.799 --> 3753.119
gonna be sarcastic well you're gonna

3751.039 --> 3754.7990000000004
have to give a hint with that because if

3753.119 --> 3756.079
you're just gonna dry

3754.799 --> 3758.0
write it down

3756.079 --> 3760.559
how would i know it's sarcasm there's

3758.0 --> 3764.319
people literally saying that stupid [ __ ]

3760.559 --> 3764.3190000000004
and meaning it how would i know

3765.28 --> 3768.7200000000003
no it doesn't work when you spell it

3766.88 --> 3772.2000000000003
like that that doesn't help at all slow

3768.72 --> 3772.2
mo moon buggy

3782.0 --> 3785.76
that's right it just makes it hard to

3783.839 --> 3787.44
read it's just annoying

3785.76 --> 3790.4
no but if you're going to be sarcastic

3787.44 --> 3792.4
you're going to have to verbally give a

3790.4 --> 3793.839
hint to that

3792.4 --> 3796.64
and if you think

3793.839 --> 3799.2
you can't do that without ruining the

3796.64 --> 3803.2799999999997
joke or whatever then just

3799.2 --> 3805.5989999999997
bracket sarcasm bracket

3803.28 --> 3809.44
it's not that difficult

3805.599 --> 3812.079
i do that yeah i do that in chats

3809.44 --> 3813.359
when i'm getting sarcastic in a way that

3812.079 --> 3815.2000000000003
people

3813.359 --> 3818.0
that i think people might actually

3815.2 --> 3818.0
misunderstand

3820.48 --> 3827.64
oh you think it was obvious

3822.799 --> 3827.64
it's too bad because it wasn't

3840.4 --> 3845.76
we were discussing a subject

3843.68 --> 3849.359
subject was gravity

3845.76 --> 3849.3590000000004
it was a relevant thing

3851.839 --> 3856.319
it's not automatically cleared up that

3853.839 --> 3859.839
that's sarcasm it's like oh yeah of

3856.319 --> 3862.319
course i know this niche detail is wrong

3859.839 --> 3863.839
oh really how would i know you of course

3862.319 --> 3866.5589999999997
know that

3863.839 --> 3869.96
you think you of course know that other

3866.559 --> 3869.96
people don't

3888.079 --> 3892.1600000000003
if you bring something up i'm just gonna

3890.079 --> 3894.4
respond to it i'm not gonna try to

3892.16 --> 3896.5589999999997
decipher whether you try to make a joke

3894.4 --> 3899.52
or not i'm just going to address it

3896.559 --> 3903.44
right that's what i do i don't have time

3899.52 --> 3905.359
to try to decipher people's jokes

3903.44 --> 3907.599
right that's not what the chat is for

3905.359 --> 3909.92
i'm not here to decipher your jokes i

3907.599 --> 3911.839
don't like to puzzle whether somebody

3909.92 --> 3914.4
was trying to make a funny or not i'm

3911.839 --> 3917.4
just addressing subjects that's what i

3914.4 --> 3917.4
do

3948.4 --> 3953.039
all right

3950.48 --> 3954.64
so yeah we worked out gravity

3953.039 --> 3957.76
everything that's

3954.64 --> 3959.52
important and related to it

3957.76 --> 3961.119
first hour

3959.52 --> 3962.96
so anything else

3961.119 --> 3963.839
could move on to a new subject we still

3962.96 --> 3966.64
have

3963.839 --> 3966.64
50 minutes

3972.96 --> 3976.0
no

3974.0 --> 3978.88
no

3976.0 --> 3980.799
oh my god aaron maverick why the hell

3978.88 --> 3984.559
would i want to do that

3980.799 --> 3986.24
why the hell would i want to do that

3984.559 --> 3989.28
but do that

3986.24 --> 3991.7599999999998
everybody is going to immediately forget

3989.28 --> 3993.599
all the details about all

3991.76 --> 3996.7200000000003
physics mechanics that i talked about

3993.599 --> 3996.7200000000003
because that's what it does

3997.92 --> 4003.76
what i have to join the other

4000.559 --> 4007.039
millions and millions of channel

4003.76 --> 4009.119
channels out there that constantly every

4007.039 --> 4011.2000000000003
[ __ ] day talk about that [ __ ] i have

4009.119 --> 4012.079
to join them do i

4011.2 --> 4014.3999999999996
no

4012.079 --> 4016.319
i'll address something when i feel like

4014.4 --> 4019.319
it i'm not gonna make my channel about

4016.319 --> 4019.319
it

4035.119 --> 4039.76
right i don't exclude it from what i

4037.44 --> 4041.039
talk about i do talk about it i'm not

4039.76 --> 4044.079
gonna make it

4041.039 --> 4045.079
that's not gonna be a staple subject in

4044.079 --> 4047.2000000000003
the show

4045.079 --> 4049.599
absolutely not

4047.2 --> 4052.3999999999996
if anything i'd like to give you an

4049.599 --> 4055.039
escape to all that

4052.4 --> 4057.119
the show where it doesn't constantly

4055.039 --> 4060.2400000000002
talk about that how about that a show

4057.119 --> 4062.2400000000002
that doesn't constantly talk

4060.24 --> 4064.72
about all that [ __ ] that you're

4062.24 --> 4067.2
constantly getting barraged with through

4064.72 --> 4068.799
all the media how about that my channel

4067.2 --> 4071.1189999999997
doesn't do that

4068.799 --> 4074.52
you're safe here

4071.119 --> 4074.52
how about that

4094.559 --> 4098.08
all right

4096.48 --> 4100.0
sorry if i come off a little strong

4098.08 --> 4103.0
there aaron maverick i know you meant

4100.0 --> 4103.0
well

4127.6 --> 4132.400000000001
yeah that's that's right

4130.319 --> 4135.759
and that's why i don't like to talk

4132.4 --> 4136.96
about it i don't want to be that guy i

4135.759 --> 4140.239
don't

4136.96 --> 4144.0
want to be the guy

4140.239 --> 4147.3589999999995
oh irwin oh isn't that the guy that gets

4144.0 --> 4151.52
all outraged i don't want to be that

4147.359 --> 4154.0
alright i don't i really really don't i

4151.52 --> 4157.120000000001
do it though sometimes

4154.0 --> 4161.52
because it does annoy the [ __ ] out of me

4157.12 --> 4164.719
for many many reasons i don't want to be

4161.52 --> 4166.080000000001
that guy i want to be the guy you

4164.719 --> 4169.04
remember

4166.08 --> 4171.2789999999995
for rectangular looping earth

4169.04 --> 4173.04
for reminding you the celestial lights

4171.279 --> 4173.759
are holographic

4173.04 --> 4176.88
for

4173.759 --> 4179.44
sharing that maybe space in this realm

4176.88 --> 4181.679
is not entirely linear

4179.44 --> 4185.599999999999
that's what i want you to remember me

4181.679 --> 4189.4400000000005
for not about how outraged i was about

4185.6 --> 4191.679
lgbq blah blah blah all right

4189.44 --> 4194.639999999999
that's a complete

4191.679 --> 4196.0
complete waste of potential

4194.64 --> 4198.56
you understand

4196.0 --> 4200.64
a million people out there are doing

4198.56 --> 4204.2390000000005
that how many people are talking about

4200.64 --> 4207.360000000001
spatial non-linearity and celestial

4204.239 --> 4207.36
holographic nature

4207.52 --> 4212.120000000001
one

4208.4 --> 4212.12
yeah i know

4225.52 --> 4229.52
i know globers look at that way and they

4227.36 --> 4232.08
could go [ __ ] themselves

4229.52 --> 4234.8
seriously

4232.08 --> 4236.96
i don't care i don't care i've already

4234.8 --> 4239.52
had plenty of rage when outbursts and

4236.96 --> 4241.76
they make their own little mini movies

4239.52 --> 4244.4800000000005
about that and then squirt because

4241.76 --> 4248.400000000001
they're gay and they're gay for me

4244.48 --> 4251.199
and i don't care i don't care

4248.4 --> 4254.0
i really don't i just want them to

4251.199 --> 4257.4
[ __ ] squirt themselves to death

4254.0 --> 4257.4
leave me alone

4265.92 --> 4270.96
of course globals will remember

4268.239 --> 4273.839999999999
everybody that confronts them with how

4270.96 --> 4275.76
unbelievably wrong their beliefs are

4273.84 --> 4277.76
they're going to remember them by

4275.76 --> 4280.96
anything but

4277.76 --> 4282.8
the actual details of reminding them how

4280.96 --> 4285.6
everything about their model is wrong of

4282.8 --> 4288.320000000001
course they will i don't give a [ __ ] i

4285.6 --> 4291.1990000000005

4293.84 --> 4301.6
what free thinking people remember me by

4297.84 --> 4304.64
and i don't want to be that angry rant

4301.6 --> 4306.56
guy that has homophobia i don't want to

4304.64 --> 4312.08
be remembered for that i want to be

4306.56 --> 4315.719
remembered for my high end ideas

dude

4387.84 --> 4393.76
that's like asking me oh could you point

4390.64 --> 4396.159000000001
out in the monster manual which demon

4393.76 --> 4398.2390000000005
you think is the worst

4396.159 --> 4399.599999999999
uh

4398.239 --> 4402.5599999999995
what

4399.6 --> 4402.56
they're all terrible

4404.48 --> 4408.5599999999995
at least the anti-flat earthers they're

4406.32 --> 4410.84
all terrible ballers not so much they're

4408.56 --> 4414.56
mostly victim of their own inability to

4410.84 --> 4417.76
cope with reality anti-flat earthers are

4414.56 --> 4420.080000000001
absolute demons absolute

4417.76 --> 4422.4800000000005
demons there's nothing

4420.08 --> 4426.0
nothing about them

4422.48 --> 4428.32
that cares about reality or truth at all

4426.0 --> 4430.0
nothing about them

4428.32 --> 4432.4
and i hate them all

4430.0 --> 4434.88
can't stand them

4432.4 --> 4436.799999999999
it's just like which one is more

4434.88 --> 4439.28
annoying

4436.8 --> 4441.28
well that depends on when

4439.28 --> 4443.92
when it is in what moment

4441.28 --> 4447.32
they're all freaking annoying as hell

4443.92 --> 4447.32
because they're demons

4462.08 --> 4465.28
try not to compare them with satan yeah

4464.48 --> 4467.5199999999995
but

4465.28 --> 4470.159
that's what they are

4467.52 --> 4473.6
they are

4470.159 --> 4477.599999999999
very comparable with satan

4473.6 --> 4477.6
aaron maverick it's just true

4480.64 --> 4488.64
they have pride in ignore ignoring god's

4484.8 --> 4492.0
law all right they have pride

4488.64 --> 4492.0
in ignoring god's law

4492.64 --> 4497.6
it's just what they are

4494.4 --> 4499.839999999999
i don't care i don't care what triggers

4497.6 --> 4499.84
them

4507.04 --> 4513.28
no god did not make gays

4510.48 --> 4515.759999999999
that's not true

4513.28 --> 4517.5199999999995
people make themselves gay they might

4515.76 --> 4520.0
have impulses

4517.52 --> 4522.320000000001
and then they choose how to deal with

4520.0 --> 4524.56
that how to deal with the tests did you

4522.32 --> 4526.4
know that god also gives you

4524.56 --> 4527.76
other tests like

4526.4 --> 4530.639999999999
vengeance

4527.76 --> 4530.64
and greed

4531.52 --> 4536.8
or even like a lust for murder

4534.08 --> 4538.96
yeah yeah god gives you everything god

4536.8 --> 4543.12
gives you the test and then it's up to

4538.96 --> 4545.84
you to pass that test or fail it

4543.12 --> 4549.159
and then assimilate the demon

4545.84 --> 4549.159000000001
that's right

4555.199 --> 4559.759999999999
he makes the test

4556.8 --> 4564.28
that's what he does he makes the test

4559.76 --> 4564.280000000001
it's up to you to choose

4570.64 --> 4574.4800000000005
everybody gets challenges in their life

4572.56 --> 4577.4400000000005
a lot of that those challenges are

4574.48 --> 4579.919999999999
literally inherited

4577.44 --> 4582.639999999999
impulses that you inherit from your

4579.92 --> 4584.4
family line

4582.64 --> 4587.1990000000005
impulse that you have to deal with and

4584.4 --> 4589.28
the family might have decided that those

4587.199 --> 4591.678999999999
bad impulses are good now and then

4589.28 --> 4593.759999999999
you're have you have to overcome that or

4591.679 --> 4596.4800000000005
you will

4593.76 --> 4596.4800000000005
become it

4596.64 --> 4601.76
i myself was confronted with a couple of

4598.96 --> 4601.76
things like that

4602.96 --> 4606.0
no no he couldn't

4606.4 --> 4609.639999999999
he won't

4609.679 --> 4613.6
it's called free will quick note it's

4611.76 --> 4616.719
called free will

4613.6 --> 4616.719
god cannot stop

4616.88 --> 4620.88
and he gives you plenty of hints and if

4618.88 --> 4624.2390000000005
you don't want to follow those hints

4620.88 --> 4627.679
then yeah then you make a bad choice

4624.239 --> 4627.678999999999
and then you gotta suffer for it

4634.32 --> 4639.679
hi merle what the hell

4636.64 --> 4639.679
there's no merle here

4647.679 --> 4652.64
now libby

4649.6 --> 4654.2390000000005
god making satan was not a mistake

4652.64 --> 4658.0
the entire point

4654.239 --> 4658.0
it's all a test everything is

4660.32 --> 4664.88
does god not have to stop the power to

4663.28 --> 4667.12
stop people

4664.88 --> 4667.12
no

4667.44 --> 4671.36
it's it would make everything completely

4669.52 --> 4675.400000000001
pointless

4671.36 --> 4675.4
people have to stop people

4679.44 --> 4682.879999999999
right and hey god gives you plenty of

4681.76 --> 4686.2390000000005
hints

4682.88 --> 4687.52
so he helps you to stop can't make you

4686.239 --> 4689.44
stop

4687.52 --> 4692.159000000001
if you are

4689.44 --> 4693.919999999999
diluted in your spirit due to dark

4692.159 --> 4697.199
influences there's nothing he can do

4693.92 --> 4700.2390000000005
about he can only warn you against it

4697.199 --> 4702.4
and make it clear what's going on

4700.239 --> 4704.879999999999
if you don't do anything with that then

4702.4 --> 4707.839999999999
you choose it

4704.88 --> 4707.84
that's how this works

4711.84 --> 4716.719
whoa if you want to perhaps just enjoy

4713.92 --> 4718.84
the test go ahead then

4716.719 --> 4722.32
let's see what happens

4718.84 --> 4724.08

4827.12 --> 4831.28
things is lies

4829.36 --> 4834.08
when you do that

4831.28 --> 4835.599999999999
lies become part of your life

4834.08 --> 4838.0
and acting

4835.6 --> 4840.400000000001
like it's all fine and dandy and you can

4838.0 --> 4842.639
do that without any consequences becomes

4840.4 --> 4845.04
the primary act

4842.639 --> 4847.12
it becomes the primary act

4845.04 --> 4848.96
self-convincing that everything is just

4847.12 --> 4850.32
fine and nothing happens to you or your

4848.96 --> 4851.12
spirit

4850.32 --> 4852.96
but

4851.12 --> 4855.5199999999995
yeah you're not gonna

4852.96 --> 4858.88
make take notice of how you lost certain

4855.52 --> 4861.360000000001
senses certain subtleties in your life

4858.88 --> 4864.0
certain blessings from god that you do

attain if you make the right choices and

4864.0 --> 4868.08
take things seriously yeah yeah oh

4866.48 --> 4870.239
you're not gonna talk about that you're

4868.08 --> 4872.639
just gonna act like it's all fine and

4870.239 --> 4874.799999999999
then you know who else does that

4872.639 --> 4877.76
you know who else does that

4874.8 --> 4879.6
really [ __ ] up evil politicians they

4877.76 --> 4881.92
also do that yeah

4879.6 --> 4884.719
you think they're not paying a price you

4881.92 --> 4885.679
think they're all just fine and dandy

4884.719 --> 4891.4800000000005
no

4885.679 --> 4891.4800000000005
no they just act like they are

4905.36 --> 4908.5199999999995
all right

4918.56 --> 4923.4400000000005
now you don't go to hell for being gay

4920.56 --> 4923.4400000000005
aaron maverick

4923.76 --> 4926.2390000000005
you don't

4927.52 --> 4933.52
how you feel

4931.12 --> 4936.639
is how you feel it's how you deal with

4933.52 --> 4940.719
that and the acts

4936.639 --> 4942.56
you perform that accompany that state

4940.719 --> 4945.04
that

4942.56 --> 4946.96
that is the real problem

4945.04 --> 4949.199
right

4946.96 --> 4950.56
how you deal with the impulses is the

4949.199 --> 4953.04
problem

4950.56 --> 4954.96
if you think you are gay that doesn't

4953.04 --> 4958.4
automatically make you go to hell it all

4954.96 --> 4960.56
depends on what you let it do to you

4958.4 --> 4963.28
and especially the people you're gonna

4960.56 --> 4966.400000000001
end up hanging around with that are

4963.28 --> 4968.32
going to influence you yeah that's the

4966.4 --> 4969.5199999999995
thing that makes you go to hell

4968.32 --> 4972.48
not

4969.52 --> 4973.4400000000005
you believing that you're gay

4972.48 --> 4976.08
and you

4973.44 --> 4977.44
attract people of the same sex

4976.08 --> 4979.92
right

4977.44 --> 4981.839999999999
that's just your problem that's it it's

4979.92 --> 4984.159
just your problem that doesn't make you

4981.84 --> 4987.1990000000005
go to hell it's the actions

4984.159 --> 4988.32
that typically flow out of that being

4987.199 --> 4990.159
like that

4988.32 --> 4992.0
that is the problem that's the thing

4990.159 --> 4993.199
that is more likely to draw you into

4992.0 --> 4994.239
hell

4993.199 --> 4996.32
not

4994.239 --> 5000.12
the thing

4996.32 --> 5000.12
you think you are

5000.32 --> 5006.28
it's the actions you take

5002.719 --> 5006.28
because of it

5015.44 --> 5018.48
are you saying if someone's gonna have

5016.88 --> 5020.88
to force themselves to live a straight

5018.48 --> 5023.04
life yeah pretty much and i know that's

5020.88 --> 5026.08
not very appealing and that's why most

5023.04 --> 5028.719
don't really end up doing it

5026.08 --> 5033.12
right that doesn't make them go to hell

5028.719 --> 5033.12
but it does make them suffer in life

5035.36 --> 5038.08
it just does

5040.56 --> 5044.56
the price they pay

5043.12 --> 5047.04
is

5044.56 --> 5050.8
that they're not really able to live a

5047.04 --> 5052.719
straight life that's the real price

5050.8 --> 5056.6
they can't get there

5052.719 --> 5056.6
they can't enjoy it

5057.44 --> 5060.32
that's the price

5064.8 --> 5070.2390000000005
oh really yeah they do

5067.199 --> 5073.599999999999
yeah they do

5070.239 --> 5076.239
oh yes they do

5073.6 --> 5077.4400000000005
oh yes they do you know how they choose

5076.239 --> 5079.28
it

5077.44 --> 5080.879999999999
by just

5079.28 --> 5082.96
assuming it

5080.88 --> 5085.92
usually because people tell them they

5082.96 --> 5088.4
are and then they just

5085.92 --> 5089.84
like oh okay well i don't see anything

5088.4 --> 5092.4
wrong with that

5089.84 --> 5096.12
so i'll just be like that now yeah

5092.4 --> 5096.12
that's called a choice

5107.36 --> 5112.88
conversion therapy i'm not i'm not even

5110.08 --> 5114.96
gonna go there right i'm not conversion

5112.88 --> 5116.88
therapy i'm just laying out howard the

5114.96 --> 5119.52
mechanics of it

5116.88 --> 5122.0
and the misconceptions about it about

5119.52 --> 5124.4800000000005
gay and what it is yeah

5122.0 --> 5127.6
not talking like oh you must oh we

5124.48 --> 5130.4

5138.84 --> 5142.639
gays right i'm gonna have to deal with

5141.04 --> 5146.0

5142.639 --> 5147.92
but i'm not going to [ __ ] pretend

of [ __ ] troll out there that is

5311.6 --> 5319.04
constantly making sock accounts

5359.28 --> 5363.12
about god

5360.88 --> 5365.04

and was it

5375.52 --> 5380.320000000001
it was a statement uh still scrolling by

5377.679 --> 5380.32
so fast

5382.48 --> 5387.36
animekin said like god only loves

5385.6 --> 5389.360000000001
i

5387.36 --> 5390.32
it's so complicated

5389.36 --> 5393.759999999999
right

5390.32 --> 5397.44
i don't think god

5393.76 --> 5400.88
feels anything i think he just designed

5397.44 --> 5402.0
everything and the feelings are in the

5400.88 --> 5403.92
design

5402.0 --> 5406.56
i don't think god really even does

5403.92 --> 5409.04
anything he's just watching he's just

5406.56 --> 5411.84
watching what we choose

5409.04 --> 5413.84
and handing out ideas

5411.84 --> 5416.4800000000005
that's it i don't think he

5413.84 --> 5416.4800000000005
he even

5416.88 --> 5421.84
dips into feeling

5419.12 --> 5424.159
at all

5421.84 --> 5428.2390000000005
i don't think that's tenable for an

5424.159 --> 5428.239
overseer of all life

5430.8 --> 5435.6
but he's definitely designed it all to

5433.92 --> 5438.159
work with love

5435.6 --> 5441.92
and to punish hatred

5438.159 --> 5444.719
right per design in the design the

5441.92 --> 5448.32
direct price the direct consequences are

5444.719 --> 5449.44
built in the very fabric of everything

5448.32 --> 5452.799999999999
we know

5449.44 --> 5456.48
yeah that's why i say

5452.8 --> 5460.2390000000005
god punishes sin not after that during

5456.48 --> 5463.28
life immediately oh you might not notice

5460.239 --> 5466.718999999999
it you might be overlooking it but he

5463.28 --> 5469.44
will tell you every single time in every

5466.719 --> 5471.92
detail it's just that people tend to be

5469.44 --> 5474.719
so diluted and distracted they can't

5471.92 --> 5477.84
handle it they forget about it

5474.719 --> 5477.84
they ignore it

5480.56 --> 5486.159000000001
you strongly dis well dude if you want

5482.639 --> 5490.0
to imagine a a emotional god creator

5486.159 --> 5491.12
that's fine you go ahead james mason

5490.0 --> 5492.8
go ahead

5491.12 --> 5494.5599999999995
i mean

5492.8 --> 5497.52
when you love and you do things right

5494.56 --> 5498.639
and you follow jesus's advice you will

5497.52 --> 5502.159000000001
have love

5498.639 --> 5503.679
but to say that love is from god from a

5502.159 --> 5506.08
literal

5503.679 --> 5508.2390000000005
entity

5506.08 --> 5510.32
it doesn't make any freaking sense to me

5508.239 --> 5513.919999999999
at all

5510.32 --> 5517.199
i think that you do receive the love but

5513.92 --> 5519.12
i think it comes just from the design

5517.199 --> 5520.48
from an approval

5519.12 --> 5523.32
and you might

5520.48 --> 5525.919999999999
in your view in your

5523.32 --> 5527.84
interpretations based on feelings

5525.92 --> 5528.8
experience that as

5527.84 --> 5530.719
hey

5528.8 --> 5532.56
god is loving me and there's nothing

5530.719 --> 5534.8
wrong with that i'm not saying like oh

5532.56 --> 5536.639
how dare you appoint feelings to god no

5534.8 --> 5538.8
no that's all fine that's how you

5536.639 --> 5541.4400000000005
experience it but i don't think he

5538.8 --> 5541.4400000000005
literally

5541.6 --> 5546.360000000001
literally has emotions over people

5548.239 --> 5551.28
he hands it out

5551.44 --> 5558.919999999999
it's built inside the vessel that your

5554.88 --> 5558.92
your consciousness seats

5562.08 --> 5567.76
and you might experience it as

5564.48 --> 5571.718999999999
the designer entity loving you and

5567.76 --> 5571.719
that's all just fine

5578.88 --> 5586.99
all right james mason that's good

5581.92 --> 5588.4
oh i missed godzilla's super chat huh

5586.99 --> 5590.639
[Laughter]

5588.4 --> 5593.679
at least arwin reads my super chats that

5590.639 --> 5596.159000000001
nathan fellow misses every other one

5593.679 --> 5598.159
well i guess i missed this one too

5596.159 --> 5600.638999999999
godzilla thank you for the five canadian

5598.159 --> 5603.839999999999
dollar super chat donation

5600.639 --> 5603.84
that's kind of ironic

5606.159 --> 5610.719
yeah that's right wrath of god that's

5608.159 --> 5613.12
called the natural consequences within

5610.719 --> 5616.0
the design

5613.12 --> 5618.5599999999995
the wrath of god is not after death it's

5616.0 --> 5621.52
in the world it's in the design it's

5618.56 --> 5623.76
right here it happens immediately or it

5621.52 --> 5627.280000000001
slowly builds up

5623.76 --> 5629.679
enough tension to actually

5627.28 --> 5631.679
counterbalance

5629.679 --> 5634.56
the sin

5631.679 --> 5634.56
that spurred it

5635.52 --> 5639.52
right

5636.88 --> 5641.92
i think that we could probably see it as

5639.52 --> 5645.84
a sense of justice

5641.92 --> 5645.84
it's a sense it's the frequency

5647.36 --> 5650.799999999999
it's built in the design

5655.28 --> 5659.84
you must try to avoid the wrath well

5657.36 --> 5659.839999999999
yeah

5663.44 --> 5666.48
you got angry with god and he punished

5665.36 --> 5667.199
you well that

5666.48 --> 5669.199
i

5667.199 --> 5673.239
would have to understand the context for

5669.199 --> 5673.239
that nunak the blessed

5674.4 --> 5679.5199999999995
i mean i've gotten angry with god a lot

5676.88 --> 5683.1990000000005
of the times i'm just being like dude

5679.52 --> 5685.52
why do you have to be like this to me

5683.199 --> 5689.678999999999
why are you making

5685.52 --> 5689.679
the obstacles difficult for me

5690.32 --> 5695.759999999999
but then eventually i always figure out

5692.239 --> 5697.36
like yeah it's always me it is

5695.76 --> 5700.320000000001
it's just every time you think you're

5697.36 --> 5702.799999999999
angry with god you're just projecting

5700.32 --> 5704.5599999999995
you're just unable to handle

5702.8 --> 5707.4400000000005
the realization of the actual

5704.56 --> 5709.360000000001
responsibility that you do have

5707.44 --> 5711.28
and then you project it onto god it's

5709.36 --> 5712.239
like oh why me

5711.28 --> 5714.48
yeah

5712.239 --> 5716.4
i have that i have that sensation

5714.48 --> 5718.159
sometimes

5716.4 --> 5720.48
but in a calm state of mind i would

5718.159 --> 5722.719
never make such statements

5720.48 --> 5726.799999999999
i would never say like oh you're good

5722.719 --> 5729.199
why did you design it imperfectly what

5726.8 --> 5731.4400000000005
what do you mean imperfectly

5729.199 --> 5734.32
oh because you couldn't handle the

5731.44 --> 5735.839999999999
situation in that little moment and now

5734.32 --> 5737.679
suddenly god designed it all in

5735.84 --> 5740.88
perfectly no

5737.679 --> 5743.52
that's freaking arrogance

5740.88 --> 5747.4800000000005
that's really arrogant to actually think

5743.52 --> 5747.4800000000005
that and hold on to that

5775.199 --> 5779.04
i figured god made me like that that's

5777.119 --> 5781.5199999999995
his fault no no

5779.04 --> 5784.239
no that's just wrong you're stupid

5781.52 --> 5786.400000000001
i can literally say that

5784.239 --> 5788.32
if you really think i figured god made

5786.4 --> 5791.679
me like that so it's his fault you're

5788.32 --> 5794.08
just stupid

5791.679 --> 5795.1990000000005
you're just stupid

5794.08 --> 5797.84
you don't

5795.199 --> 5800.879999999999
seem to realize it's your responsibility

5797.84 --> 5803.4400000000005
oh you think god is just going to

5800.88 --> 5805.76
design everything

5803.44 --> 5809.44
just so you could squirt and have

5805.76 --> 5811.84
pleasure all the time and be happy no

5809.44 --> 5814.4
that's not how this design is it's a

5811.84 --> 5816.639
giant test if you think that you're just

5814.4 --> 5818.4
stupid

5816.639 --> 5821.92
really

5818.4 --> 5821.92
i'm not even being harsh on you

5824.96 --> 5830.4800000000005
then i thought god made me stupid yeah

5828.8 --> 5833.360000000001
well he probably gave you the

5830.48 --> 5835.28
opportunity to prevent

5833.36 --> 5837.599999999999
becoming stupid

5835.28 --> 5841.28
but apparently you chose a direction

5837.6 --> 5844.2390000000005
where you did become stupid that's right

5841.28 --> 5844.239
that's your fault

5844.32 --> 5850.679
you could have wisened up

5847.36 --> 5850.679
but you didn't

5862.48 --> 5865.48
ah

5882.32 --> 5887.44
oh i bet you do

5884.719 --> 5888.56
i mean being stupid

5887.44 --> 5891.28
is

5888.56 --> 5893.52
very relieving right you don't have to

5891.28 --> 5897.04
take the responsibility for a lot of

5893.52 --> 5898.4800000000005
things because you just residing to oh i

5897.04 --> 5901.28
can't handle that

5898.48 --> 5901.28
i'm just dumb

5901.44 --> 5906.239
oh that's called weakness

5904.0 --> 5909.199
not rising to meet the challenge that's

5906.239 --> 5911.04
what that is it's called not rising to

5909.199 --> 5916.36
meet the challenge

5911.04 --> 5916.36
nunak the blessed did not sell blessed

5924.159 --> 5929.679
and hey ignorance is bliss

5926.56 --> 5934.1990000000005
until it kills ya

5929.679 --> 5934.1990000000005
they don't tell you that part do they

5942.54 --> 5945.72
[Music]

5955.44 --> 5959.44
are you gonna die anyway yeah

5964.0 --> 5967.6
that's fine

5966.88 --> 5970.8
well

5967.6 --> 5972.8
then when you die you can look out and

5970.8 --> 5974.719
realize

5972.8 --> 5976.320000000001
everything you withheld from yourself

5974.719 --> 5977.119
through your ignorance and then you can

5976.32 --> 5979.679
look

5977.119 --> 5981.199
back on a past life the unique life

5979.679 --> 5983.6
experience

5981.199 --> 5985.04
where you didn't do anything because you

5983.6 --> 5986.719
thought you were useless and you

5985.04 --> 5988.8
believed it

5986.719 --> 5990.88
you didn't rise to meet the challenge so

5988.8 --> 5992.639
you basically wasted your life and you

5990.88 --> 5995.04
can sit on that

5992.639 --> 5998.639
in the next life

5995.04 --> 5998.639
for the rest of your next life

5999.76 --> 6004.400000000001
and with that next life i'm not

6002.239 --> 6006.32
not even saying it's literally a life

6004.4 --> 6007.44
wherever your consciousness goes after

6006.32 --> 6009.5199999999995
this

6007.44 --> 6011.839999999999
you can sit on that like yeah that's how

6009.52 --> 6013.360000000001
i freaking wasted my time by not meeting

6011.84 --> 6017.56
the challenges because i thought i was

6013.36 --> 6017.5599999999995
too weak and i believed it

6023.52 --> 6028.96
god i hope

6025.119 --> 6030.4
they pay you too you will not really

6028.96 --> 6034.76
they should though

6030.4 --> 6034.759999999999

6342.719 --> 6346.8
i don't know man everybody has their own

6345.44 --> 6349.119
thing

6346.8 --> 6351.52
i appreciate most of you

6349.119 --> 6354.48
sometimes i even appreciate for just

6351.52 --> 6358.4800000000005
taking a stand as to where you stand in

6354.48 --> 6360.638999999999
opposition to something i'm saying

6358.48 --> 6363.5199999999995
right to just be honest about what you

6360.639 --> 6365.36
think and not try to like oh oh arwyn

6363.52 --> 6367.280000000001
says this that means that i'm going to

6365.36 --> 6371.32
agree or something

6367.28 --> 6371.32
but most of you have that

6372.08 --> 6375.84
right and

6373.92 --> 6378.96
yeah

6375.84 --> 6378.96
so it's difficult

6381.44 --> 6386.759999999999
man jung

6382.88 --> 6386.76
it's been around forever

6388.56 --> 6392.400000000001
mark caller to

6390.4 --> 6396.28
james mason

6392.4 --> 6396.28
also goes way back

6404.239 --> 6409.759999999999
and yeah at times i even can like people

6407.52 --> 6412.4800000000005
like bad karma

6409.76 --> 6416.56
or cps i might even appreciate them

6412.48 --> 6416.5599999999995
although i wouldn't put them on the list

6416.88 --> 6421.119
but still it's very difficult to say

6418.88 --> 6422.719
like these are my favorite people

6421.119 --> 6424.96
because

6422.719 --> 6424.96
yeah

6425.6 --> 6429.719
everybody has their own quality

6441.52 --> 6446.2390000000005
yeah return to normal

6443.44 --> 6448.48
although you can be a bit of a

6446.239 --> 6450.48
blabber mouth too but that's all fine a

6448.48 --> 6452.4
brand m there you go

6450.48 --> 6454.799999999999
there's a really great girl been

6452.4 --> 6458.4
supporting me through patreon

6454.8 --> 6460.400000000001
she was like the first patreon

6458.4 --> 6462.719
and she doesn't really speak up all that

6460.4 --> 6466.28
much in the chat but i do really

6462.719 --> 6466.28
appreciate her

6471.6 --> 6477.04
dutch sailor of course that's it but

6473.6 --> 6479.6
yeah that's also very

6477.04 --> 6481.44
yeah complicated

6479.6 --> 6483.119000000001
dutch sailor and me have gotten like

6481.44 --> 6485.678999999999
into

6483.119 --> 6488.799999999999
yeah sort of a fight too

6485.679 --> 6492.56
it's not difficult to describe

6488.8 --> 6492.56
we've gone back for quite a while

6496.239 --> 6500.879999999999
can you mention your least favorite

6498.639 --> 6500.88
uh

6500.96 --> 6504.4800000000005
i think that would be brenda

6506.0 --> 6508.239
like

6509.199 --> 6514.638999999999
brenda that gets still gets into the uh

6515.679 --> 6518.4800000000005
into the brandon show

6517.679 --> 6522.32
like

6518.48 --> 6524.239
that is someone i just every time she

6522.32 --> 6526.799999999999
whatever it is

6524.239 --> 6529.04
says something in chat it's just like

6526.8 --> 6531.6
ugh

6529.04 --> 6534.56
so that's yeah i'm gonna like very

6531.6 --> 6537.04
quickly choose brenda to be my least

6534.56 --> 6538.639
favorite chat member the person that

6537.04 --> 6540.56
gets in chat

6538.639 --> 6542.8
that's why she's banned and i'm never

6540.56 --> 6544.8
unbanning her every time i even thought

6542.8 --> 6547.28
of considering it and then then like

6544.8 --> 6550.96
immediately just the pile of [ __ ] rolls

6547.28 --> 6553.119
out immediately every single time

6550.96 --> 6555.84
hey only people can see a long time no

6553.119 --> 6555.839999999999
see yeah

6564.08 --> 6568.48
ever notice the most hateful people

6566.239 --> 6570.32
never seem to show their faces as they

6568.48 --> 6572.799999999999
judge yeah

6570.32 --> 6572.799999999999
of course

6574.4 --> 6580.4
they don't want to be judged themselves

6577.92 --> 6582.08
thank you for the 2 10 new zealand

6580.4 --> 6583.759999999999
dollar super chat donation i hope you're

6582.08 --> 6585.84
doing well by the way

6583.76 --> 6588.320000000001
it's been quite a lot of hassle uh down

6585.84 --> 6588.32
on there

6588.719 --> 6593.84
i hope you're doing well

6590.56 --> 6597.400000000001
your business is still running i hope

6593.84 --> 6597.400000000001
how's your kid

6605.76 --> 6608.76
anyway

6618.159 --> 6623.36
doing okay okay well that's better than

6620.96 --> 6625.04
nothing i guess

6623.36 --> 6628.639
i hope you're getting through all this

6625.04 --> 6629.679
nonsense not taking any v's

6628.639 --> 6631.76
ever

6629.679 --> 6633.36
and especially protect your kid from

6631.76 --> 6636.0
that

6633.36 --> 6637.44
and your wife

6636.0 --> 6639.84
if you want to get any more kids you

6637.44 --> 6639.839999999999
know

6640.4 --> 6644.08
but i think you probably know about that

6642.48 --> 6646.4
and

6644.08 --> 6649.4
it's kind of hard to miss

6646.4 --> 6649.4
uh

6655.28 --> 6659.599
all right so i'm getting a lot of super

6656.719 --> 6659.599
chats today

6659.76 --> 6664.56
oh kind of hoping i'm also going to get

6661.679 --> 6664.56
some paypals

6664.639 --> 6667.84
i could really use it again

6669.04 --> 6674.56

i spoke too soon

6675.28 --> 6680.159

that's a very fitting number

6686.719 --> 6691.199
now unfortunately disney he didn't send

6688.8 --> 6694.84
me a thousand euros that would be

6691.199 --> 6694.839999999999
but yeah

6696.32 --> 6700.48
it's the next best comparable number

6698.4 --> 6703.759999999999
thank you so much man that's gonna help

6700.48 --> 6705.119
a lot thank you so much

6703.76 --> 6706.719
james mason

6705.119 --> 6708.799999999999

6706.719 --> 6709.92
said like your super chat you sent me

6708.8 --> 6712.0
something i

6709.92 --> 6715.36
must have overlooked it

6712.0 --> 6715.36
thank you so much man

6721.28 --> 6724.8
it's like every time it's just like

6728.639 --> 6733.28
sometimes with with the paypals i feel

6731.36 --> 6735.36
like i'm

6733.28 --> 6737.759999999999
like a person living on the planet

6735.36 --> 6741.598999999999
spaceballs and it's like oh thank god i

6737.76 --> 6741.599
got a can of fresh air again

6743.199 --> 6749.08
serious i'm not even joking it really

6745.52 --> 6749.080000000001
feels like that

6750.96 --> 6755.92
breathing room

6752.56 --> 6758.159000000001
it matters thank you so much james mason

6755.92 --> 6760.159
and thank you everybody else also for

6758.159 --> 6762.879999999999
all the great support

6760.159 --> 6765.28
throughout the years

6762.88 --> 6768.32
it's been quite a blast

6765.28 --> 6769.759999999999
and quite a voyage

6768.32 --> 6773.5199999999995
a lot of

6769.76 --> 6775.360000000001
ups and downs emotionally

6773.52 --> 6777.52
health-wise too man

6775.36 --> 6780.159
have you like compared like what i

6777.52 --> 6780.159000000001
looked like

6780.48 --> 6785.759999999999
like during my flat earth talks

6783.76 --> 6788.320000000001
and during the early early birthdays i

6785.76 --> 6789.92
had a lot of skin issues and [ __ ] like a

6788.32 --> 6792.08
lot

6789.92 --> 6796.32
terrible sometimes it and it was

6792.08 --> 6797.76
painfully that's all gone away

6796.32 --> 6801.199
i'm so happy

6797.76 --> 6804.56
that i am more healthy now

6801.199 --> 6806.96
it's not perfect i i kind of miss my air

6804.56 --> 6810.320000000001
filter

6806.96 --> 6813.04
but still i'm doing remarkably well

6810.32 --> 6816.0
i think if i have to compare it to say

6813.04 --> 6816.0
four years ago

6817.679 --> 6821.84
hey caro apple good to see you

6822.159 --> 6826.638999999999
thank you

6823.76 --> 6828.719
yeah it's been a great show so far

6826.639 --> 6831.719
although i am gonna have to round it out

6828.719 --> 6831.719
soon

6834.56 --> 6841.1990000000005
yeah mark caller yes spaceballs dude

6837.92 --> 6844.4
spaceballs is like a fine wine

6841.199 --> 6846.239
it only gets better the more time passes

6844.4 --> 6850.08
once you figure out flat earth

6846.239 --> 6852.879999999999
spaceballs is freaking hilarious

6850.08 --> 6855.84
and it was always fun even as a baller i

6852.88 --> 6858.2390000000005
thought it was a really fun movie

6855.84 --> 6860.2390000000005
a little weird though

6858.239 --> 6861.04
but then when you start to figure out

6860.239 --> 6864.4
how

6861.04 --> 6867.28
ludicrous space is and [ __ ] and sci-fi

6864.4 --> 6872.119
then it becomes really funny

6867.28 --> 6872.119
trust me on this it's a great movie

6878.32 --> 6882.159
hey rob h yeah shout out to good servant

6880.4 --> 6883.839999999999
he was here earlier

6882.159 --> 6886.638999999999
you know good servant does a lot of

6883.84 --> 6890.0
streams these days after the flat earth

6886.639 --> 6892.56
debates live show ends then he starts up

6890.0 --> 6894.639
a stream it's kind of fun and he's

6892.56 --> 6896.56
holding in there like he's really doing

6894.639 --> 6897.679
it and it's working he's doing it on his

6896.56 --> 6899.92
own

6897.679 --> 6901.119
and it's i'm i'm actually kind of proud

6899.92 --> 6903.119
of him

6901.119 --> 6906.4
because i talked to him a lot behind the

6903.119 --> 6909.44
scenes i used not so much anymore but i

6906.4 --> 6912.239
did a lot now it's kind of like we

6909.44 --> 6914.638999999999
kind of know where we're at

6912.239 --> 6916.239
and he always had a lot of trouble just

6914.639 --> 6918.08
doing a show

6916.239 --> 6921.04
it was always desperate to find a

6918.08 --> 6922.32
partner to do the show with

6921.04 --> 6924.56
but he's

6922.32 --> 6926.32
taken that step and he's just doing it

6924.56 --> 6929.04
on his own and i'm very proud of you

6926.32 --> 6931.44
good sir i really am i know it was very

6929.04 --> 6932.4
difficult to go there but you're doing

6931.44 --> 6935.678999999999
it and

6932.4 --> 6939.5199999999995
i think you're doing pretty well

6935.679 --> 6939.52
so well done well done man

6940.639 --> 6945.04
i hope you make it to a thousand

6942.239 --> 6947.04
episodes too

6945.04 --> 6949.5199999999995
right anyway

6947.04 --> 6952.239
i'm gonna round out so thanks everyone

6949.52 --> 6954.080000000001
for coming it's been a great show

6952.239 --> 6956.239
really happy

6954.08 --> 6958.5599999999995
very unlike yesterday show where i was

6956.239 --> 6960.799999999999
totally stressed out very easily

6958.56 --> 6963.1990000000005
triggerable and just overall in a bad

6960.8 --> 6966.159000000001
mood today was great the weather was

6963.199 --> 6969.199
great the people in chat were great

6966.159 --> 6970.879999999999
the cha the trolls were relatively weak

6969.199 --> 6974.4
and harmless

6970.88 --> 6975.599
it hasn't ruined my mood at all

6974.4 --> 6978.96
he

6975.599 --> 6981.28
oh look at that 154

6978.96 --> 6983.84
down votes isn't that just hilarious it

6981.28 --> 6986.88
doesn't mean anything you see now

6983.84 --> 6988.56
that that number there it literally

6986.88 --> 6990.639
means nothing

6988.56 --> 6993.119000000001
nothing it has no consequential

6990.639 --> 6995.4400000000005
influence don't do you see

6993.119 --> 6997.679
it doesn't mean anything it was a great

6995.44 --> 6997.678999999999
show

6997.92 --> 7002.32
and besides the number is probably going

6999.76 --> 7003.84
to rush down really quickly after a few

7002.32 --> 7005.599
hours

7003.84 --> 7006.8
it usually does

7005.599 --> 7007.599
right

7006.8 --> 7010.2390000000005
so

7007.599 --> 7012.88
