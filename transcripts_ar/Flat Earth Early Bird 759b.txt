4.72 --> 11.08
and welcome back

7.359 --> 14.32
to flat earth early bird number

11.08 --> 16.4
759 the second half

14.32 --> 19.359
my internet just got cut off i had to

16.4 --> 19.358999999999998
reset everything

23.76 --> 31.840000000000003
but i'm back hopefully people will also

26.56 --> 31.84
be back in chat

35.44 --> 45.839999999999996
might take a while before they realize

37.76 --> 45.839999999999996
i'm live

55.68 --> 59.359
hey george stanford no not a computer

57.76 --> 62.96
crash the internet

59.359 --> 64.66
got flattened had to reset

62.96 --> 67.78
everything

64.66 --> 67.78
[Music]

68.159 --> 73.84
welcome back robin stanley

72.0 --> 87.84
i completely lost my train of thought it

73.84 --> 87.84
was in the middle of something

94.24 --> 102.72
was it again asked about

98.96 --> 102.72
all right the biggest conspiracy

108.24 --> 112.479
and deception and i basically put

111.28 --> 115.6
forward like what

112.479 --> 117.28
you think you should do about it because

115.6 --> 121.03999999999999
if you think you can get rid of it

117.28 --> 123.2
in the world then you're probably

121.04 --> 125.43900000000001
mistaken because it's it doesn't seem to

123.2 --> 126.799
be up to three people to decide that

125.439 --> 129.84
what the media is gonna do

126.799 --> 129.84
it's another party

130.0 --> 132.879
that's part of it

133.84 --> 138.31900000000002
so i think it's mostly just important to

136.16 --> 138.319
be

139.04 --> 142.4
consciously self-sufficient in what you

141.44 --> 144.319
know

142.4 --> 147.28
and try to get as much deception out of

144.319 --> 147.28
the way as you can

148.16 --> 152.48
but don't expect that you can get rid of

154.84 --> 158.8
it

156.72 --> 160.8
because these things don't go away that

158.8 --> 163.519
easily so as long as people are

160.8 --> 163.519
championing it

167.04 --> 171.84
the issue is letting knowledge overtake

169.04 --> 171.84
you in fear

172.56 --> 176.08
right well you just got to realize how

174.72 --> 179.12
these deceptions

176.08 --> 182.48000000000002
work how all of them

179.12 --> 184.4
work and then

182.48 --> 187.35999999999999
yeah there are other people that are

184.4 --> 189.519
awakened to it

187.36 --> 191.519
and they're still just going about so

189.519 --> 192.4
just because you discover a secret

191.519 --> 195.12
doesn't mean that

192.4 --> 197.28
there's immediate retribution coming so

195.12 --> 199.68
you just got to get rid of that

197.28 --> 202.08
fear response reflex once you figure

199.68 --> 206.15900000000002
something out is a deception

202.08 --> 206.15900000000002
if you ever had that in the first place

210.72 --> 214.159
please answer that question well i i did

212.879 --> 219.51899999999998
i just spent

214.159 --> 219.519
i literally now just basically tried to

221.77 --> 224.81900000000002
[Music]

224.84 --> 227.84
respond

231.12 --> 241.84
because yeah what more deception

242.72 --> 246.959
like technically the entire reality

245.28 --> 250.72
might be a giant string

246.959 --> 251.84
of deceptions but because of the essence

250.72 --> 255.12
that is carried

251.84 --> 258.0
within it it doesn't mean that

255.12 --> 260.16
everything should be discarded

258.0 --> 261.04
i'm trying to see things more like this

260.16 --> 263.28000000000003
like

261.04 --> 264.08000000000004
everything it's like a fractal of

263.28 --> 269.84
deception

264.08 --> 269.84
and truths

292.56 --> 295.62
[Music]

298.24 --> 305.28000000000003
right turret 306 then that's also

301.759 --> 308.639
again again i explained before about

305.28 --> 309.52
mistakes and lies what's the difference

308.639 --> 312.639
right

309.52 --> 315.52
or a lie always

312.639 --> 317.6
in a way has to be built on truth it

315.52 --> 317.919
can't even be a proper deception if it's

317.6 --> 320.08000000000004
not

317.919 --> 322.32
built on truth and that's also what

320.08 --> 325.68
makes it a lie a good lie is

322.32 --> 327.68
a lie because it's built on truth it's a

325.68 --> 331.36
choice to deceive

327.68 --> 331.36
build on knowledge of the truth

331.44 --> 334.71999999999997
because if it isn't if it's just

333.12 --> 337.759
delusional

334.72 --> 338.08000000000004
then it's seen as delusional then it's

337.759 --> 340.16
not

338.08 --> 342.71999999999997
really a good lie because it's not based

340.16 --> 342.72
on truth

344.0 --> 353.84
it's a mechanic

358.72 --> 362.56
they trick us into tricking ourselves

364.84 --> 367.84
yeah

371.039 --> 377.75
but tricking yourself is also just a

374.479 --> 378.84
natural mechanism to cope with

377.75 --> 381.199
[Music]

378.84 --> 384.08
situations

381.199 --> 386.88
because the sensation of uncertainty is

384.08 --> 386.88
not pleasant

386.96 --> 392.56
and yeah good

390.639 --> 394.72
for whatever that's worth really in this

392.56 --> 399.12
context good liars

394.72 --> 399.12
know that and they play into that need

403.44 --> 411.36
this typically grapplers are perfect

407.28 --> 412.79999999999995
in that they go to social engineering

411.36 --> 415.199
levels

412.8 --> 423.84000000000003
for their applications of their lies and

415.199 --> 423.84000000000003
their stories

446.87 --> 452.37
[Music]

462.479 --> 467.75899999999996
right so i hope that basically answers

465.919 --> 468.96
that question it's a very yeah it's a

467.759 --> 473.039
very complicated

468.96 --> 475.75899999999996
heavy question pretty much tara 306

473.039 --> 477.68
but there's just there's so much more to

475.759 --> 480.56
do

477.68 --> 482.319
it's not about finding more it's about

480.56 --> 484.0
dealing with that which you have

482.319 --> 487.199
discovered

484.0 --> 487.199
and how do you do that

490.24 --> 496.319
can you build a sensible system for it

492.639 --> 499.759
that will help you continue development

496.319 --> 502.8
like a fractal you don't expand you go

499.759 --> 502.8
deeper inside

504.72 --> 507.84000000000003
more detail

527.519 --> 531.2
maybe flat earthers haven't found a

529.2 --> 535.0400000000001
bigger deception well do you think that

531.2 --> 535.44
flat earth is over just because there is

535.04 --> 537.68
now

535.44 --> 540.9590000000001
a group of people that have a consensus

537.68 --> 544.0799999999999
on what the shape's supposed to be

540.959 --> 544.0799999999999
do you think that's over

545.279 --> 551.36
well unless you make it only about

548.399 --> 552.56
it's not a ball yeah that's at some

551.36 --> 554.48
point is over

552.56 --> 556.3199999999999
it doesn't mean that we truly know what

554.48 --> 558.72
the realm really is

556.32 --> 561.0400000000001
it's where i come in with rectangular

558.72 --> 562.8000000000001
looping concepts and just the wide range

561.04 --> 566.3199999999999
of possibilities

562.8 --> 577.6099999999999
of the layout now that's

566.32 --> 580.749
what i've been doing

577.61 --> 580.749
[Music]

584.56 --> 589.1999999999999
but even if it would ever be allowed to

588.16 --> 592.8
be attained

589.2 --> 595.279
the the true complete knowledge of the

592.8 --> 597.5999999999999
the surreal nature of the realm then

595.279 --> 599.92
that's not the end because there is

597.6 --> 601.0400000000001
i foresee that there is a much bigger

599.92 --> 605.519
journey inward

601.04 --> 608.8
much faster outward concerning the realm

605.519 --> 612.64
there is a limited amount of space so

608.8 --> 615.76
that's just a barrier that cannot

612.64 --> 619.4399999999999
get bigger so the fractal outwards

615.76 --> 622.64
is it eventually stops now the fractal

619.44 --> 624.32
inward is potentially infinite

622.64 --> 626.24
so there's much more to discover about

624.32 --> 629.9200000000001
the spirit and

626.24 --> 632.16
even about doing things with that

629.92 --> 634.16
which would be considered to people that

632.16 --> 638.16
don't do that like magical

634.16 --> 638.16
there is just so much more there

638.32 --> 641.6
but it's also yeah

642.56 --> 649.68
it's heavy

646.079 --> 649.68
and you gotta be very serious

649.839 --> 660.8800000000001
because if you're just fooling around

651.44 --> 666.5600000000001
you're gonna crash

660.88 --> 666.56
hey aries 106 math question you think

671.6 --> 679.0400000000001
uh well

675.839 --> 679.0400000000001
say repeating

679.2 --> 689.839
yeah no

682.8 --> 689.8389999999999
it's not one if it was one it was one

690.0 --> 694.64
it's smaller than one maybe infinitely

693.04 --> 697.8389999999999
smaller

694.64 --> 700.0
than one but still one not one because

697.839 --> 701.2790000000001
one is one and if it's not one then it's

700.0 --> 703.839
not one

701.279 --> 703.8389999999999
this is

707.81 --> 715.819
[Music]

718.29 --> 721.4499999999999
[Music]

722.959 --> 726.079
big liar how do liars live with

724.88 --> 727.92
themselves well by

726.079 --> 730.7199999999999
constantly spending time trying to

727.92 --> 732.959
forget about it

730.72 --> 734.0
trying to see if they can envision and

732.959 --> 737.1199999999999
build on a world

734.0 --> 738.959
that can keep the knowledge and the

737.12 --> 741.76
consequences of their lives out and

738.959 --> 744.56
guess what that's extremely difficult

741.76 --> 746.16
and it breaks very easily so that's how

744.56 --> 749.04
they live with themselves they live with

746.16 --> 749.04
the consequences

749.12 --> 754.0
and they try not to ever show those

751.68 --> 755.519
consequences to anybody else

754.0 --> 757.519
because that makes them even more

755.519 --> 758.0
fragile because people out there hate

757.519 --> 760.24
them

758.0 --> 761.2
for their lives if they show

760.24 --> 765.519
vulnerability

761.2 --> 773.839
then they will get

765.519 --> 773.839
things like vengeance

781.58 --> 784.69
[Music]

792.17 --> 795.27
[Music]

795.839 --> 801.839
where do astronauts go after this life

799.12 --> 801.839
i don't know

812.56 --> 820.0
depends on who they are and it look

817.12 --> 820.5600000000001
i i used to have a concept i don't know

820.0 --> 823.839
how

820.56 --> 824.399
real it is but a concept basically

823.839 --> 827.839
states

824.399 --> 831.519
that as long as you have your as long as

827.839 --> 835.2790000000001
your spirit has the ability to suffer

831.519 --> 836.88
from consequences then there is still an

835.279 --> 838.72
option to go to heaven

836.88 --> 839.92
because it's only when you basically

838.72 --> 842.8000000000001
ignore all of it

839.92 --> 845.5999999999999
forever that's when you truly get

842.8 --> 845.5999999999999
dislocated

848.8 --> 852.8
you lose everything that would be going

851.68 --> 856.16
to heaven

852.8 --> 859.519
but yeah it's a conceptual approach i

856.16 --> 859.519
i try not to

859.68 --> 863.12
worry about it it's like it's not my

862.32 --> 866.32
business

863.12 --> 866.32
that's god's business

868.959 --> 872.16
because most of the consequences of

871.04 --> 875.92
things people do

872.16 --> 875.92
already meet them in life

876.72 --> 880.0
doing bad things limits your options

878.959 --> 884.8
limits your freedom

880.0 --> 888.079
limits the ability to enjoy things

884.8 --> 889.92
that so yeah i'm not concerned about who

888.079 --> 891.8389999999999
where they gonna end up in some hell or

889.92 --> 894.24
something because i feel they deserve it

891.839 --> 900.9590000000001
because i'm so angry about them

894.24 --> 900.9590000000001
right i just try not to do that

901.04 --> 908.8
or at least try not to believe

904.8 --> 908.8
in what comes rolling out of me when i'm

910.839 --> 913.839
angry

916.079 --> 927.8389999999999
jeff c died who is that

938.839 --> 941.839
uh

944.32 --> 950.1600000000001
all right well terret 306 what

948.24 --> 951.6800000000001
have you ever considered that maybe even

950.16 --> 953.04
like the things like the moon landing

951.68 --> 956.16
and nasa

953.04 --> 958.16
that it is effectively a

956.16 --> 960.7199999999999
a sort of pyramid scheme set up where

958.16 --> 963.92
they draw in people

960.72 --> 965.6800000000001
that do it because they think

963.92 --> 967.5999999999999
it's important for their country they've

965.68 --> 968.0
been made to believe it's very important

967.6 --> 970.639
for their

968.0 --> 972.56
country and they know they're lying but

970.639 --> 975.6800000000001
like they really believe

972.56 --> 978.079
that they need to do that now does that

975.68 --> 980.959
make them evil

978.079 --> 983.04
no but it will have a dramatic

980.959 --> 985.4399999999999
consequence on their being

983.04 --> 987.12
and they can grow towards evil they can

985.44 --> 990.48
basically

987.12 --> 994.0
lose the spirit and then just say

990.48 --> 997.279
everybody's just stupid i hate it all

994.0 --> 999.92
or they could just sit through it and

997.279 --> 1003.92
then it's a very heavy journey

999.92 --> 1003.92
i can imagine very heavy

1005.92 --> 1011.8389999999999
so i yeah

1015.199 --> 1020.079
actors don't lie they just play their

1016.959 --> 1020.079
role right yeah that's

1022.839 --> 1027.579
exactly

1024.109 --> 1027.579

hey ciao and cat thank you for the 1.99

1038.48 --> 1043.52
super jet donation and a briefcase

1044.64 --> 1049.679
a smiley a heart and an airplane on it i

1050.84 --> 1053.84
think

1054.24 --> 1058.24
actors know they're lying of course

1060.64 --> 1064.72
that of course you know it's not the

1062.72 --> 1081.84
truth

1064.72 --> 1081.84
that it would make no sense otherwise

1082.08 --> 1086.08
but if they believe they're doing it for

1083.919 --> 1087.2
a righteous cause then that doesn't make

1086.08 --> 1089.28
them evil

1087.2 --> 1091.2
although i don't even know if that is

1089.28 --> 1094.3999999999999
even the spirit of it anymore it might

1091.2 --> 1096.24
have been at the start

1094.4 --> 1098.48
probably also why the first the

1096.24 --> 1101.28
moonlander astronauts supposedly

1098.48 --> 1101.679
were in such a heavy mood when they came

1101.28 --> 1103.44
back

1101.679 --> 1104.799
because they did really think they were

1103.44 --> 1106.72
doing it for the country

1104.799 --> 1108.0
because they had a sense of honor all

1106.72 --> 1110.559
the newer people might

1108.0 --> 1111.44
be just like they yeah there might be

1110.559 --> 1113.6789999999999
more

1111.44 --> 1117.3600000000001
colloquially satanic and just don't give

1113.679 --> 1117.3600000000001
a [ __ ] don't have any respect

1117.679 --> 1122.0
i don't know because i don't know them i

1120.24 --> 1124.24
just know that a lot of them i don't

1122.0 --> 1124.24
like

1125.2 --> 1129.2
how they look how they compose

1126.799 --> 1131.039
themselves i

1129.2 --> 1133.039
don't get a good feeling of them as they

1131.039 --> 1135.12
say but i don't know them

1133.039 --> 1136.64
i don't know exactly how they are what

1135.12 --> 1151.84
motivates them what they really think

1136.64 --> 1151.8400000000001
about what they're doing

1156.32 --> 1159.5
[Music]

1162.84 --> 1165.84
uh

1172.72 --> 1178.08
to destroy morals and create fear

1176.48 --> 1180.96
propagating globe lie

1178.08 --> 1180.96
is truly evil

1185.36 --> 1191.1999999999998
well like actively demoralizing is never

1189.52 --> 1194.559
really a good thing

1191.2 --> 1197.1200000000001
unless it's i guess part of of the story

1194.559 --> 1199.9189999999999
of the mechanism

1197.12 --> 1199.9189999999999
so yeah

1202.0 --> 1207.84
i don't know

1208.64 --> 1213.5200000000002
still it's only actually like even if

1211.76 --> 1215.28
they're actors and they have no respect

1213.52 --> 1217.12
then it doesn't have to be truly evil

1215.28 --> 1218.3999999999999
because they might simply be doing it

1217.12 --> 1221.36
like puppets

1218.4 --> 1222.159
and are not really conscious about it so

1221.36 --> 1225.4399999999998
they don't even

1222.159 --> 1227.1200000000001
size up what the influence might be

1225.44 --> 1228.559
they just see it like a theater play and

1227.12 --> 1232.08
they don't really care

1228.559 --> 1234.24
you know only true evil is truly evil

1232.08 --> 1236.559
only if somebody does that that is like

1234.24 --> 1237.2
really knowing the damage they cause and

1236.559 --> 1240.8799999999999
they're like

1237.2 --> 1240.88
holding back their joy of it

1245.76 --> 1252.24
that i guess in such a sense but i

1249.12 --> 1256.32
haven't really seen that had

1252.24 --> 1256.32
seen weird moments from people

1257.12 --> 1262.799
but like even like the super

1260.24 --> 1264.159
liberal agenda that something comes

1262.799 --> 1265.28
forward i think that some of these

1264.159 --> 1268.72
people

1265.28 --> 1268.72
just really believe that

1271.039 --> 1275.12
they really believe it's a good thing

1273.44 --> 1277.8400000000001
they're just that deluded

1275.12 --> 1277.84
about it

1283.66 --> 1286.709
[Music]

1289.679 --> 1292.72
hey here we go again

1299.84 --> 1302.559
jeff settle

1303.6 --> 1305.84
hello

1307.63 --> 1310.779
[Music]

1327.52 --> 1332.799
i sorry but tara 306

1331.039 --> 1335.44
but the natural consequence of the

1332.799 --> 1339.9189999999999
statement you made means that

1335.44 --> 1342.96
all space sci-fi will become illegal

1339.919 --> 1342.96
think that's a good thing

1343.36 --> 1347.1999999999998
think that's okay like all of it it's

1346.159 --> 1350.7990000000002
just like yeah

1347.2 --> 1351.2
it that lie is cannot be tolerated that

1350.799 --> 1354.6399999999999
would

1351.2 --> 1357.52
imply that all science fiction in space

1354.64 --> 1360.5590000000002
and with planets would become illegal

1357.52 --> 1363.52
right is that really what you want

1360.559 --> 1366.48
you think that'll help things or make

1363.52 --> 1366.48
people happier

1369.44 --> 1378.96
yeah of course they should go on

1375.039 --> 1382.8799999999999
what do you think that like

1378.96 --> 1384.559
fantasy series should not go on because

1382.88 --> 1386.96
they have things in them that are not

1384.559 --> 1389.6789999999999
real obviously

1386.96 --> 1392.159
no the problem is not the storytelling

1389.679 --> 1403.76
medium the problem is the reification

1392.159 --> 1407.3600000000001
into reality that's the real problem

1403.76 --> 1408.0
like outer space fantasy or science

1407.36 --> 1410.799
fiction

1408.0 --> 1412.96
should just be classified as a fantasy

1410.799 --> 1415.12
genre

1412.96 --> 1416.159
because that is what it really is and

1415.12 --> 1418.3999999999999
the reification

1416.159 --> 1420.0
should stop doesn't mean that you cannot

1418.4 --> 1422.96
be amazed by it

1420.0 --> 1422.96
and enjoy it

1424.159 --> 1431.8400000000001
but as fiction

1435.76 --> 1438.799
space concept

1441.039 --> 1447.44
how long will it go on

1444.24 --> 1450.32
well until all interest

1447.44 --> 1450.3200000000002
is lost in it

1455.279 --> 1459.84
but yeah i don't know if that will

1457.44 --> 1459.8400000000001
happen

1472.72 --> 1476.4
now with certain arguments i could make

1474.96 --> 1478.24
from a

1476.4 --> 1480.48
from a perspective that i don't really

1478.24 --> 1483.52
support

1480.48 --> 1486.4
but yeah i'm not gonna do that could

1483.52 --> 1488.96
yeah i could say something to help you

1486.4 --> 1488.96
understand

1490.72 --> 1495.44
it's just a storytelling medium that's

1493.36 --> 1501.84
how i see it

1495.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
why eradicate it

1511.919 --> 1519.76
they mock us well look

1515.679 --> 1519.76
once yeah

1520.159 --> 1523.5200000000002
yes of course they mock us but it is

1522.159 --> 1526.5590000000002
part look

1523.52 --> 1529.039
they have to within the fantasy they

1526.559 --> 1531.6
have to do that

1529.039 --> 1533.12
in the sand within a science fiction

1531.6 --> 1535.039
medium they have to

1533.12 --> 1536.6399999999999
mock flat earthers because otherwise it

1535.039 --> 1538.48
makes no sense

1536.64 --> 1540.4
and why not it's actually kind of

1538.48 --> 1543.35
interesting

1540.4 --> 1544.64
from a fantasy perspective

1543.35 --> 1548.08
[Music]

1544.64 --> 1550.72
do you believe what you say absolutely

1548.08 --> 1550.72
every word

1551.12 --> 1558.6399999999999
and i've always been a global apologist

1554.24 --> 1558.64
i'm just not apologetic of terrible

1568.84 --> 1571.84
behavior

1583.279 --> 1588.88
yeah that's right jeff settle it is

1586.96 --> 1591.8400000000001
it's it's one of the biggest it's

1588.88 --> 1594.0800000000002
amazing that it worked so well

1591.84 --> 1595.1999999999998
and i think it's art or something

1594.08 --> 1599.4399999999998
exactly that's

1595.2 --> 1604.0
exactly what i think indeed

1599.44 --> 1606.72
what you don't like that think i

1604.0 --> 1608.64
should not do that no i must hate it it

1606.72 --> 1612.32
must be destroyed well guess what

1608.64 --> 1616.24
no no

1612.32 --> 1619.6
don't think so it's just the utilization

1616.24 --> 1627.84
how it's being used should not be used

1619.6 --> 1627.84
it should not be used like that

1628.48 --> 1633.6
it should not be used as a tool of

1630.88 --> 1635.679
manipulation

1633.6 --> 1637.6
it doesn't mean that it cannot be used

1635.679 --> 1640.159
as a storytelling medium

1637.6 --> 1655.84
as some great science fiction stories

1640.159 --> 1655.8400000000001
out there

1656.24 --> 1660.559
no biggie did i say no biggie oh i'm a

1659.76 --> 1663.919
fraud oh

1660.559 --> 1667.12
savannah savage oh you know better

1663.919 --> 1670.96
i i only am on the scene for five

1667.12 --> 1674.08
years right

1670.96 --> 1676.96
my own daily show for three years

1674.08 --> 1679.039
flat earth debates yeah i'm a fraud no

1676.96 --> 1679.52
big did i ever say no biggie no it is a

1679.039 --> 1682.72
biggie

1679.52 --> 1686.24
it's it's huge it doesn't mean it should

1682.72 --> 1686.24
all destroy everything

1687.679 --> 1691.919
my ulterior motives yeah yeah you know

1690.08 --> 1694.96
what the ulterior motives is

1691.919 --> 1697.279
let's not destroy things just because

1694.96 --> 1701.1200000000001
we're hurt in a moment

1697.279 --> 1705.2
how about we actually transcend it

1701.12 --> 1707.84
use it it's like see it like this

1705.2 --> 1709.2
let's say there is like a in ancient

1707.84 --> 1711.52
times there is a big

1709.2 --> 1713.3600000000001
religious cult and they do very evil

1711.52 --> 1716.32
things and they're very mind controlly

1713.36 --> 1716.799
but guess what they make amazing art

1716.32 --> 1720.08
like

1716.799 --> 1723.279
they're really good at it right so

1720.08 --> 1725.9189999999999
once that control of that is toppled

1723.279 --> 1726.48
like an invading army whatever does that

1725.919 --> 1728.72
mean

1726.48 --> 1729.52
trash it all that's destroyed all all

1728.72 --> 1733.279
that art

1729.52 --> 1736.32
no no that's not what you do

1733.279 --> 1740.08
you try to learn from it

1736.32 --> 1743.279
and maybe take some of it

1740.08 --> 1744.1589999999999
as art and that's the entire world is

1743.279 --> 1748.0
filled with that

1744.159 --> 1749.1200000000001
you think that any big empire or kingdom

1748.0 --> 1750.96
or whatever that has

1749.12 --> 1753.039
amazing art you think that's all good

1750.96 --> 1756.0
guys

1753.039 --> 1759.2
you think they even made it for a good

1756.0 --> 1761.44
reason just for the beauty of it no way

1759.2 --> 1762.72
big projects are never done just for the

1761.44 --> 1764.88
beauty it's always

1762.72 --> 1766.08
used for control because that's the only

1764.88 --> 1770.48
thing that's really worth

1766.08 --> 1776.24
it worth the effort you know that's

1770.48 --> 1776.24
yeah that's how things turn out to work

1776.32 --> 1780.799
doesn't mean you have to destroy

1777.919 --> 1781.6000000000001
everything just don't be a barbarian

1780.799 --> 1784.8799999999999
about it

1781.6 --> 1787.1999999999998
oh i'm tricked destroy it all no

1784.88 --> 1789.2
that's just stupid when you destroy it

1787.2 --> 1791.1200000000001
or when you remove all traces of it

1789.2 --> 1792.24
only thing that happens is that you

1791.12 --> 1794.559
forget all about it

1792.24 --> 1797.1200000000001
and then future generation might just be

1794.559 --> 1798.799
tricked all the same all over again

1797.12 --> 1802.559
you have to learn from history you have

1798.799 --> 1802.559
to adapt to it don't destroy it

1807.039 --> 1812.559
think about it before you go elsa vagne

1810.24 --> 1812.559
on me

1815.42 --> 1818.789
[Music]

1819.36 --> 1822.4799999999998
right derek 306 yeah rumpus is amazing

1822.0 --> 1826.72
because

1822.48 --> 1826.72
i think he really believes his fantasy

1826.96 --> 1830.0
he's a true believer he's also a

1829.279 --> 1832.799
deceiver

1830.0 --> 1835.6
a manipulator but in the core of it i

1832.799 --> 1838.399
think he really believes it

1835.6 --> 1839.36
i can feel it the enthusiasm the

1838.399 --> 1841.279
enthusiasm

1839.36 --> 1843.279
if you're truly a liar you don't believe

1841.279 --> 1851.84
in your lies you cannot find that level

1843.279 --> 1851.84
of enthusiasm

1854.0 --> 1857.039
yeah it's called history repeating

1856.0 --> 1859.2
itself jet

1857.039 --> 1860.559
jeff settle maybe you should look into

1859.2 --> 1862.8400000000001
it history

1860.559 --> 1864.24
yeah i hear myself you got a problem

1862.84 --> 1866.0
here

1864.24 --> 1868.72
somebody seems to be spiraling in

1866.0 --> 1870.399
slovenia mode

1868.72 --> 1871.84
if you don't have anything sensible to

1870.399 --> 1874.0
say i'm just gonna end up banning you

1871.84 --> 1879.84
because this is garbage

1874.0 --> 1879.84
what you're putting out now

1890.84 --> 1893.84
really

1894.96 --> 1901.039
jeff settle it should be this simple

1898.32 --> 1903.039
we've won flat earth argument wise

1901.039 --> 1906.1589999999999
technical wise physics wise

1903.039 --> 1908.8799999999999
has won it's very apparent we win

1906.159 --> 1911.279
right does that mean oh let's destroy

1908.88 --> 1911.279
them all

1911.44 --> 1915.519
that's preposterous

1917.84 --> 1921.039
we can document things yeah yeah and

1920.32 --> 1924.08
guess what

1921.039 --> 1924.08
then at some point

1924.88 --> 1930.7990000000002
we can talk people can

1928.159 --> 1932.3990000000001
document things for a very very long

1930.799 --> 1934.96
time what do you think is laying around

1932.399 --> 1938.0
in the vatican

1934.96 --> 1940.64
that's a lot of documentation

1938.0 --> 1942.799
guess what if it's not being put out

1940.64 --> 1945.279
there for everybody to know event or

1942.799 --> 1948.32
they lose interest

1945.279 --> 1948.88
goes away then eventually they'll forget

1948.32 --> 1950.799
about it

1948.88 --> 1952.3990000000001
and they don't know what it is anymore

1950.799 --> 1954.1589999999999
they know there are secrets they don't

1952.399 --> 1957.4399999999998
know what it is

1954.159 --> 1957.44
you're not thinking about this

1958.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
yeah you are done here and apparently

1960.399 --> 1963.84
you are dumb you're correct

1984.0 --> 1990.159
like you're being very fed by iron man

1987.76 --> 1992.32
like you just want to destroy it you're

1990.159 --> 1994.159
not thinking about it

1992.32 --> 1996.0
what think destroying it will just

1994.159 --> 1997.279
relieve your stress and then it's over

1996.0 --> 2001.36
no it's just gonna make

1997.279 --> 2004.799
room and more room for more power to try

2001.36 --> 2007.84
something new and chaos

2004.799 --> 2011.44
what about all these people that

2007.84 --> 2014.6399999999999
are not going to hand be able to handle

2011.44 --> 2015.76
that like all these true believers and

2014.64 --> 2017.2
then

2015.76 --> 2018.96
everything has to be erased they're

2017.2 --> 2020.32
going to think like the nazis are taking

2018.96 --> 2024.159
over and they're destroying all

2020.32 --> 2027.039
information they're going to go nuts

2024.159 --> 2029.0390000000002
and from a justified perspective because

there 306

is

2085.839 --> 2091.52
is the show look it's not about the

2091.52 --> 2095.7599999999998
won

2092.24 --> 2099.04
it's about showing the belief

2095.76 --> 2101.28
the religious aspect of it to basically

2099.04 --> 2103.2799999999997
reveal that it is really a religion that

2101.28 --> 2106.5600000000004
when presented with actual facts

2103.28 --> 2110.0
people will deflect them and keep going

2106.56 --> 2113.839
to reveal like it's not error

2110.0 --> 2118.48
it's a religion it was designed

2113.839 --> 2122.24
for people to get into a certain mindset

2118.48 --> 2123.68
and then deflect actual arguments to

2122.24 --> 2126.3199999999997
defend their belief

2123.68 --> 2128.48
that's what it really is and that's

2126.32 --> 2130.0
what's useful about letting rumpus on

2128.48 --> 2132.079
and a lot of ballers

2130.0 --> 2133.839
to basically show that it doesn't matter

2132.079 --> 2136.6400000000003
if you have facts

2133.839 --> 2138.72
the ballers don't care the real

trenchers the real believers the true

2138.72 --> 2142.839

2139.359 --> 2145.839
the zealots to show that that's the

2142.839 --> 2145.839

minor arthritis

2154.72 --> 2162.3199999999997
i'd go for tumeric

2158.24 --> 2166.64
absolutely tumeric

2162.32 --> 2166.6400000000003
it's it's magical what it does

they sell

let me get one

2212.839 --> 2216.96
hmm

2215.04 --> 2219.04
and with they i mean the organic

2216.96 --> 2223.68
supermarket

2219.04 --> 2226.8
but this is like ginger turmeric chili

2223.68 --> 2230.48
juice really great stuff i think this

2226.8 --> 2230.48
would probably do a lot

2230.56 --> 2243.839
because it's all fresh

2253.04 --> 2259.04
arthritis

2254.8 --> 2259.04
is complicated because it is really like

2259.599 --> 2266.56
uh that aberrant growth

2263.119 --> 2268.079
it's like the the tissue or what is it

2266.56 --> 2272.32
the bone

2268.079 --> 2274.079
it now it grows so you can't just get it

2272.32 --> 2277.44
out it's not like there is

2274.079 --> 2279.6800000000003
sediments there it's really like a

2277.44 --> 2281.28
malgrowing situation i don't know if

2279.68 --> 2283.5989999999997
that's reversible

2281.28 --> 2284.96
but i do know tumeric basically slows it

2283.599 --> 2288.88
down

2284.96 --> 2291.04
and eases up the joints and all that

2288.88 --> 2293.52
no i would not get a vaccine get the

2291.04 --> 2293.52
[ __ ] out

oh nice

2358.56 --> 2369.839
i really like this stuff

2376.0 --> 2381.04
all right oh by the way weird thing

2379.119 --> 2383.6800000000003
i got from my dad i don't even know what

2381.04 --> 2386.24
i might i'm gonna try to test it out

2383.68 --> 2389.1189999999997
apparently there is a pass this is

2386.24 --> 2392.72
written in dutch

2389.119 --> 2394.6400000000003
this is supposed to be an official pass

2392.72 --> 2396.48
that you don't need to wear a mask i

2394.64 --> 2398.16
don't know if it works i have never

2396.48 --> 2401.599
tested i don't even know if people

2398.16 --> 2402.56
recognize this thing but my dad gave it

2401.599 --> 2406.319
to me

2402.56 --> 2408.56
so maybe i might be able to

2406.319 --> 2410.64
get into places without a mask when they

2408.56 --> 2413.04
would normally officially mandate it or

2410.64 --> 2413.04
whatever

2413.119 --> 2416.4
but i'm gonna test it out

2417.599 --> 2420.7200000000003
like i'm specifically gonna test it out

2419.44 --> 2421.92
with the coffee shop because that's the

2420.72 --> 2426.8799999999997
only place that i

2421.92 --> 2426.88
have been like really forced to wear it

2466.16 --> 2472.16
pretty enthusiastic about it

2468.96 --> 2474.96
because it's working for him

2472.16 --> 2477.5989999999997
i don't know if yeah if things will go

2474.96 --> 2481.04
the same over here

2477.599 --> 2485.04
but i will take it with me so that i can

2481.04 --> 2485.04
potentially like bring it out

2489.28 --> 2493.76
it's just that i kind of refuse to wear

2491.44 --> 2495.52
it because it will totally break my look

2493.76 --> 2498.7200000000003

2495.52 --> 2500.48
no text and then to just have to

2498.72 --> 2502.0789999999997
yeah like a piece of paper on me with

2500.48 --> 2505.04
the text it's just like

2502.079 --> 2505.04
i don't like that

2505.2 --> 2509.04
but i will bring it out of my bag when

2507.839 --> 2513.2799999999997
needed

2509.04 --> 2513.2799999999997
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2519.359 --> 2525.2799999999997
oh zack sterling yeah i'd like to think

2521.359 --> 2525.2799999999997
that i have a lot of nice ladies in here

2534.839 --> 2537.839
indeed

2541.52 --> 2550.079
tone facts it's a lie in a genocide well

2545.44 --> 2550.96
yeah don't know about the genocide part

2550.079 --> 2554.88
just yet

2550.96 --> 2554.88
it's more like a slow genocide

2556.72 --> 2565.7599999999998
on average anyway but yeah i'm not

2559.2 --> 2568.64
taking vaccines anymore

2565.76 --> 2570.8
and i i don't really need it you know

2568.64 --> 2571.359
like i've really bolstered my immune

2570.8 --> 2573.119
system

2571.359 --> 2574.96
also with my habits and just my

2573.119 --> 2578.0
consciousness and everything so i

2574.96 --> 2579.92
i really don't need it like

2578.0 --> 2581.839
even for if you're going to believe in

2579.92 --> 2585.52
the concept of how it's supposed to work

2581.839 --> 2588.7999999999997
and it's all fabricated properly

2585.52 --> 2590.96
and not by some mega corporation to do

2588.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
what it's officially supposed to do

2590.96 --> 2593.839
originally right

2594.8 --> 2598.48
well even by those standards of what

2596.88 --> 2599.359
it's supposed to i don't need it i just

2598.48 --> 2602.72
don't need it

2599.359 --> 2607.839
i i really trust in my body

2602.72 --> 2607.839
and in my natural bacteria system

2610.4 --> 2613.839
my natural defenses

2614.4 --> 2620.64
and that doesn't mean that i'll never

2615.68 --> 2625.52
get sick it just means that i'll never

2620.64 --> 2625.52
get unusual bad things

2625.599 --> 2629.599
like a lot of issues that i had over my

2628.16 --> 2631.44
life

2629.599 --> 2634.56
i don't really get them anymore that

2631.44 --> 2636.64
yeah like just compare it to say

2634.56 --> 2639.359
four years ago i had all these issues

2636.64 --> 2639.359
with my face

2640.72 --> 2646.0789999999997
yeah it was terrible experience i never

2644.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
had it that bad right away but

2646.079 --> 2651.92
i did typically have issues like that

2649.839 --> 2653.599
just minor things that would spoil my

2651.92 --> 2655.359
looks in the past

2653.599 --> 2658.2400000000002
i don't seem to have that anymore now

2655.359 --> 2658.24
it's just stop

2659.839 --> 2664.0789999999997
and i don't attribute these things to

2661.92 --> 2667.119
diseases anymore it's just

2664.079 --> 2669.8390000000004
conditions and then the symptoms

2667.119 --> 2670.2400000000002
that might arrive with those conditions

2669.839 --> 2673.44
so

2670.24 --> 2675.9199999999996
like that i still

2673.44 --> 2678.64
think germ theory when it concerns

2675.92 --> 2682.079
bacteria and parasites is legitimate

2678.64 --> 2684.4
i just apply terrain

2682.079 --> 2687.28
theory much more i'm more focused on

2684.4 --> 2687.28
that aspect

2687.839 --> 2705.839
but again one does not undo the other

2707.839 --> 2711.52
even though it's now this official an

2710.4 --> 2713.04
official thing

2711.52 --> 2715.119
where a lot of people are saying germ

2713.04 --> 2718.48
theory is all [ __ ]

2715.119 --> 2720.48
well it's not a good tag it doesn't make

2718.48 --> 2723.52
you more awoke to put that

2720.48 --> 2724.72
in your list of conspiracies because

2723.52 --> 2728.64
it's not

2724.72 --> 2730.72
it's just viruses virus theory

2728.64 --> 2733.04
that is highly dubious there's no actual

2730.72 --> 2736.16
proof for it

2733.04 --> 2736.96
but germs bacteria and parasites oh yeah

2736.16 --> 2740.56
they are real

2736.96 --> 2742.4
it's just not exclusively that it is

2740.56 --> 2744.0789999999997
also the influences in general

2742.4 --> 2747.599
conditions of the body which

2744.079 --> 2751.76
really falls under terrain theory

2747.599 --> 2761.839
so both apply it's just viruses are fake

2751.76 --> 2761.8390000000004
not germs

2776.56 --> 2780.56
has anybody else been noticing that that

2778.64 --> 2780.96
that sort of claim is popping up in the

2780.56 --> 2784.319
list

2780.96 --> 2786.56
of conspiracies people just say

2784.319 --> 2787.839
german theory well it's a mistake it's

2786.56 --> 2790.16
like an error

2787.839 --> 2791.44
that's being taken for granted put in

2790.16 --> 2793.2799999999997
there

2791.44 --> 2794.96
i hope people will eventually figure

2793.28 --> 2796.6400000000003
that out and they'll kind of take it out

2794.96 --> 2799.599
again because it's a mistake it's

2796.64 --> 2803.04
incorrect it just

2799.599 --> 2806.2400000000002
it takes it just shows

2803.04 --> 2809.599
that you don't fully understand what

2806.24 --> 2811.7599999999998
what the situation about it is

2809.599 --> 2814.079
if you say it like that just makes you

2811.76 --> 2817.0400000000004
look unresearched

2814.079 --> 2819.2000000000003
so don't say it germ theory is not

2817.04 --> 2822.24
debunked

2819.2 --> 2823.9199999999996
virus theory is

2822.24 --> 2826.64
debunked in the sense that there's never

2823.92 --> 2826.64
been actually

2826.88 --> 2831.839
there's never been real scientific

2828.96 --> 2831.839
evidence for it

2833.05 --> 2840.319
[Music]

2836.16 --> 2840.319
virus does not exist well

2841.68 --> 2845.9199999999996
like what is a virus you know there is a

2844.8 --> 2849.119
cleaning a

2845.92 --> 2850.0
cleanup mechanism on a microbiological

2849.119 --> 2853.2000000000003
scale

2850.0 --> 2855.04
in every living being

2853.2 --> 2856.319
and so there are these particles that

2855.04 --> 2858.72
are called viruses

2856.319 --> 2859.92
that typically come forward they're not

2858.72 --> 2863.9199999999996
they're not cells

2859.92 --> 2863.92
they're more like protein particles

2864.4 --> 2871.52
right they're not living things

2868.0 --> 2875.119
and they don't have an agenda separate

2871.52 --> 2876.4
from the entity from the entire being so

2875.119 --> 2879.599
they are

2876.4 --> 2881.599
not what virus theory

2879.599 --> 2882.8
says viruses are that's where the

2881.599 --> 2884.6400000000003
mistake is

2882.8 --> 2886.7200000000003
doesn't mean there isn't anything going

2884.64 --> 2889.7599999999998
on it's just what they say

2886.72 --> 2892.319
it does is completely unproven

2889.76 --> 2892.3190000000004
and wrong

2894.079 --> 2901.8390000000004
it's not what they say it is

2902.0 --> 2904.72
viruses are

2905.44 --> 2909.28
or well those particles that are

2907.44 --> 2910.16
associated with viruses what they

2909.28 --> 2914.1600000000003
actually are is

2910.16 --> 2919.2799999999997
a cleanup mechanism on a cellular level

2914.16 --> 2921.5989999999997
with acute toxic situations they appear

2919.28 --> 2924.8
take out damaged cells and use it

2921.599 --> 2930.1600000000003
mechanically to reproduce to

2924.8 --> 2930.1600000000003
yeah to basically get the process going

2930.319 --> 2933.7599999999998
and they clean up they literally remove

2932.64 --> 2935.5989999999997
toxins

2933.76 --> 2938.4
locally on a cellular level that's

2935.599 --> 2938.4
really what they do

2939.44 --> 2946.16
like an emergency cleanup crew

2943.04 --> 2947.599
in a in a damaged or compromised

2946.16 --> 2950.16
situation

2947.599 --> 2956.29
but they are a natural part of the

2950.16 --> 2959.2799999999997
mechanisms in the body

2956.29 --> 2970.96
[Music]

2959.28 --> 2975.76
hello my new god

2970.96 --> 2979.359
right and seeking star wars bacteria

2975.76 --> 2981.3590000000004
well they're not always that dangerous

2979.359 --> 2983.2799999999997
well there are some dangerous bacteria

2981.359 --> 2985.359
and they can be made more dangerous or

2983.28 --> 2988.7200000000003
made more harmless

2985.359 --> 2992.72
even they evolve

2988.72 --> 2995.1189999999997
they change relatively rapidly

2992.72 --> 2996.24
depending on the situations but not all

2995.119 --> 2999.2000000000003
bacteria dangerous

2996.24 --> 3000.9599999999996
because we have our own bacteria

2999.2 --> 3004.48
especially on our skin and

3000.96 --> 3008.2400000000002
the digestive system that

3004.48 --> 3010.48
deal with bacteria from the outside

3008.24 --> 3012.64
and if our bacteria are really strong

3010.48 --> 3015.92
and dynamic

3012.64 --> 3018.96
and vibrant well-fed then

3015.92 --> 3020.8
yeah bacteria even though potentially

3018.96 --> 3021.839
very damaging to somebody who's in a

3020.8 --> 3024.96
weak state

3021.839 --> 3026.0
it won't do anything to you because your

3024.96 --> 3028.7200000000003
own system will just

3026.0 --> 3028.72
take care of it

3033.839 --> 3041.839
your own bacteria will take care of it

3044.0 --> 3049.389
[Music]

3055.76 --> 3059.6800000000003
now if you were as a baby properly

3057.68 --> 3062.7999999999997
breastfed

3059.68 --> 3063.359
that'll help that mechanism on average a

3062.8 --> 3065.3590000000004
lot

3063.359 --> 3066.88
it'll help your natural immune system to

3065.359 --> 3069.52
be a lot better

3066.88 --> 3071.28
and if you've also been not overly

3069.52 --> 3073.92
protected as a baby

3071.28 --> 3075.3590000000004
and allowed to some point basically

3073.92 --> 3079.2000000000003
crawl around in

3075.359 --> 3082.319
in the dirt not poison dirt like

3079.2 --> 3085.68
industrial poison but like wild

3082.319 --> 3087.04
situations in the forest real wild dirt

3085.68 --> 3090.75
and if they've been allowed to be

3087.04 --> 3094.86
exposed to that it'll be even stronger

3090.75 --> 3094.86
[Music]

3095.359 --> 3099.839
because yeah you assimilate more

3101.28 --> 3108.4
and better bacteria you evolve your own

3104.8 --> 3108.4
defense systems that way

oklahoma all right

3276.839 --> 3279.839
uh

3280.16 --> 3283.52
some people don't believe in seven

3281.76 --> 3286.3190000000004
chakras in her body

3283.52 --> 3286.319
yeah sure i do

3288.799 --> 3307.839
and we got three outside of her body as

3290.799 --> 3307.839
well did you know that

3308.11 --> 3311.719
[Music]

3312.88 --> 3316.6400000000003
please talk i want to hear about it

3315.25 --> 3321.839
[Music]

3316.64 --> 3321.839
it's it just has to do with

3324.4 --> 3328.559
i don't even know why it is there it but

3326.799 --> 3330.559
it is a pattern

3328.559 --> 3332.48
there's one chakra that's basically

3330.559 --> 3334.4
effectively above your head

3332.48 --> 3338.2400000000002
and there's two lists like one at your

3334.4 --> 3341.04
knees and also one at your heels

3338.24 --> 3344.0
but they are of less influence and it

3341.04 --> 3344.0
just has to do with

3344.24 --> 3350.0
complicated things it's how the spirit

3346.559 --> 3350.0
ties into the body and

3350.88 --> 3355.28
i've never been a complete expert in it

3352.88 --> 3357.52
but i came across the concept of chakras

3355.28 --> 3360.1600000000003
pretty early on

3357.52 --> 3362.0
i assimilated it and i've been kind of

3360.16 --> 3377.839
taking it for granted ever since but

3362.0 --> 3377.839
it just it works out really well

3391.599 --> 3396.559
but yeah it comes it's like the chakras

3393.839 --> 3398.96
represent like a spectrum

3396.559 --> 3400.96
of consciousness that's really what it

3398.96 --> 3404.799
is

3400.96 --> 3408.48
so you have the god consciousness

3404.799 --> 3409.599
and you have like yeah the more down you

3408.48 --> 3412.16
go

3409.599 --> 3413.599
the lower frequency aspects will be

3412.16 --> 3415.839
associated with it

3413.599 --> 3418.079
doesn't mean that it's bad it's just

3415.839 --> 3421.52
like that's the nexus point for that

3418.079 --> 3425.599
type of concern or behavior

3421.52 --> 3428.96
and yeah that's how i learned about it

3425.599 --> 3433.119
every chakra has a very specific type of

3428.96 --> 3434.559
association with think i remember of all

3433.119 --> 3437.28
of it

3434.559 --> 3439.28
or at least the bodily ones it's the

3437.28 --> 3442.7200000000003
crown chakra it's purple it's

3439.28 --> 3442.7200000000003
like the

3444.839 --> 3449.839
uh

3446.24 --> 3450.9599999999996
it's like a the more intuitive higher

3449.839 --> 3453.52
consciousness

3450.96 --> 3454.079
and like grabbing onto bigger issues

3453.52 --> 3457.52
it's like

3454.079 --> 3461.28
that the oversight and then there is the

3457.52 --> 3466.319
the dark blue one which is really

3461.28 --> 3469.2000000000003
associated with vision and understanding

3466.319 --> 3470.72
it yeah maybe mixing up the the purple

3469.2 --> 3471.52
and the blue one and if the light blue

3470.72 --> 3474.0
that's your throat

3471.52 --> 3475.44
chakra that's really expression and

3474.0 --> 3477.2
communication

3475.44 --> 3478.96
then you have green it's the central

3477.2 --> 3481.7599999999998
it's a heart chakra

3478.96 --> 3483.92
concerning heart issues and social

3481.76 --> 3486.3190000000004
feelings and

3483.92 --> 3487.6800000000003
connections with others and then there

3486.319 --> 3490.799
is

3487.68 --> 3493.44
yellow which is all about the will

3490.799 --> 3495.2
will of what you want what you want to

3493.44 --> 3497.92
do

3495.2 --> 3499.9199999999996
also potential dominance over others or

3497.92 --> 3502.2400000000002
submission to others

3499.92 --> 3505.839
then there's orange which is much about

3502.24 --> 3509.5989999999997
sexuality and celebration

3505.839 --> 3511.599
related and yeah that's a lot of

3509.599 --> 3514.88
implications and then there's the red

3511.599 --> 3519.52
which is at your yeah

3514.88 --> 3523.15
at your butt and that's uh associated

3519.52 --> 3525.119
with like survival instincts and

3523.15 --> 3529.2000000000003
[Music]

3525.119 --> 3532.4
like food like the the real survival

3529.2 --> 3536.0789999999997
related basic instinct situation

3532.4 --> 3538.1600000000003
and also like yeah the

3536.079 --> 3539.92
important to like how you are

3538.16 --> 3543.1189999999997
manifesting in the world like your

3539.92 --> 3546.4
connection to the earthly as they say

3543.119 --> 3549.6800000000003
how much you are connected

3546.4 --> 3551.6800000000003
physically with your spirit into your

3549.68 --> 3553.839
body into this world

3551.68 --> 3559.839
so that's kind of the basics of what i

3553.839 --> 3559.839
learned about it

3563.119 --> 3567.28
current hinduism is a distortion

3565.04 --> 3568.4
grappler form of original vedic culture

3567.28 --> 3571.6800000000003
is it

3568.4 --> 3572.64
that's that's unfortunately i don't know

3571.68 --> 3575.04
about the current

3572.64 --> 3577.44
hinduism at all i don't know anything

3575.04 --> 3577.44
about it

3578.75 --> 3583.68

3581.119 --> 3586.03

3607.25 --> 3614.079
[Music]

3610.24 --> 3617.5989999999997
is a manipulative opportunist

3614.079 --> 3620.319
who basically usually smart people

3617.599 --> 3623.44
that see something comet and just use

3620.319 --> 3623.44
the opportunity to

3623.839 --> 3628.0789999999997
not get higher consciousness out of it

3625.92 --> 3629.76
but get more control get more power get

3628.079 --> 3632.6400000000003
more money

3629.76 --> 3635.2000000000003
is it is a way of doing things it's very

3632.64 --> 3639.1189999999997
counter opposite to christ

3635.2 --> 3639.1189999999997
and we've come to call it grabbler

3640.48 --> 3648.88
and that's because originally the onion

3643.92 --> 3653.44
news had like a a video clip about it

3648.88 --> 3653.44
like it you yeah yeah exactly

3654.0 --> 3657.04
well they have them too because i don't

3656.48 --> 3660.64
think all

3657.04 --> 3663.44
jews are like that but

3660.64 --> 3666.24
yeah they they are very they do

3663.44 --> 3668.839
certainly have them

3666.24 --> 3671.9199999999996
but yeah we instead of just calling it

3668.839 --> 3673.839
that that's cute that's very very cute

3671.92 --> 3674.96
but we call it a grabbler because you

3673.839 --> 3678.0
don't have to be

3674.96 --> 3680.48
jewish to be that

3678.0 --> 3683.04
grabblers are everywhere in everything

3680.48 --> 3686.72
every religion every power

3683.04 --> 3690.079
structure every race if you even

3686.72 --> 3691.68
want to use that terminology it's a

3690.079 --> 3694.7200000000003
mechanism it's a

3691.68 --> 3694.72
way of doing things

3696.48 --> 3702.949
and it's not exclusive to jews

3699.81 --> 3702.949
[Music]

3706.799 --> 3710.16
yeah counter opposite to the the path of

3708.96 --> 3713.839
christ to

3710.16 --> 3713.839
his way of doing things

3714.319 --> 3717.68
that frequency it's the opposite it's

3716.799 --> 3722.88
exploitive

3717.68 --> 3722.8799999999997
it's earthly it it's not

3723.119 --> 3727.76
resulting if you fall if you do if you

3725.76 --> 3741.8390000000004
are like a gravel it doesn't result into

3727.76 --> 3741.8390000000004
enlightenment it never does

3743.119 --> 3747.839
grabber right uh

3748.799 --> 3752.079
yeah you can look it up like the the

3750.64 --> 3752.64
video is still out there if you just

3752.079 --> 3755.44
look for

3752.64 --> 3769.839
onion news and grappler you can still

3755.44 --> 3769.839
find the video out there

3783.039 --> 3788.079
yeah i tried to give zach sterling uh by

3786.24 --> 3790.3999999999996
literally his channel the other time the

3788.079 --> 3793.76
other day last week

3790.4 --> 3795.44
i think was it but then the

3793.76 --> 3798.6400000000003
the links were blocked so i couldn't

3795.44 --> 3798.64
link it up that was weird

3800.4 --> 3811.839
but yeah that ability has been restored

3802.64 --> 3811.839
by youtube it was probably just a glitch

3813.599 --> 3825.839
there was a grappler in bed knobs and

3815.68 --> 3825.839
broomsticks i don't know what that is

3836.839 --> 3839.839
what

3840.29 --> 3844.319
[Music]

3842.0 --> 3846.48
didn't crump gravel that lady i don't

3844.319 --> 3850.839
know

3846.48 --> 3852.2400000000002
that's not grappling grabbing is not

3850.839 --> 3856.0
graveling

3852.24 --> 3858.72
trump grabbler no not really

3856.0 --> 3858.72
maybe a little

3859.359 --> 3863.68
he's certainly surrounded by gravelers

3861.76 --> 3868.7990000000004
and then again he is like

3863.68 --> 3872.3999999999996
i guess he is but i don't dislike him

3868.799 --> 3875.359
it's just that yeah

3872.4 --> 3876.559
if you blindly trust him like with every

3875.359 --> 3879.119
grappler then you will

3876.559 --> 3881.039
end up having a problem because they

3879.119 --> 3895.839
play their games

3881.039 --> 3895.8390000000004
they always do

3908.0 --> 3923.839
what the hell this is ryan arthur didn't

3910.319 --> 3923.839

all right yeah free tobacco y'all if

4141.52 --> 4144.96
you're gonna work in the cigarette

4143.199 --> 4146.5599999999995
factory that's of course the first thing

4144.96 --> 4149.92
they're going to offer you

4146.56 --> 4149.92
because they got so much of that

4152.08 --> 4156.239
and yeah when you buy directly from the

4154.08 --> 4159.92
company often they don't even really

4156.239 --> 4163.919999999999
they don't have to pay taxes it's less

4159.92 --> 4163.92
of a hassle all that so yeah that's very

4172.839 --> 4176.239
normal

4174.0 --> 4176.239
right

4181.6 --> 4186.839
you use the new word well you got to

4184.719 --> 4189.52
figure out first what it really is

4186.839 --> 4192.96
because people don't

4189.52 --> 4192.96
just grab all things

4198.64 --> 4204.320000000001
like grappling really implies a very

4201.84 --> 4208.4800000000005
carefully planned

4204.32 --> 4212.08
thing you can't just spontaneously grab

4208.48 --> 4212.08
or something doesn't work like that

4213.04 --> 4217.12
because then it's not it's a just

4214.719 --> 4221.199
impulsive act it's not grappling

4217.12 --> 4221.199
grabbing grapplers always plan

4227.92 --> 4232.2390000000005
but yeah you'll figure that out maybe

4230.159 --> 4236.0
watch him owen benjamin

4232.239 --> 4238.48
because he sometimes talks about it

4236.0 --> 4239.28
he basically elaborated the concept a

4238.48 --> 4241.36
lot and

4239.28 --> 4242.48
you could almost say like introduced it

4241.36 --> 4244.23
as a

4242.48 --> 4245.919999999999
cultural phenomenon into

4244.23 --> 4250.08
[Music]

4245.92 --> 4259.84
into popular culture now or

4250.08 --> 4259.84
yeah right

4260.56 --> 4265.52
automatic tobacco injector okay

4266.64 --> 4270.719
yeah i i just get the whole leaf

4271.28 --> 4277.5199999999995
organic and all from

4274.4 --> 4280.159
uh america or canada either way

4277.52 --> 4281.280000000001
from plantations over there i i recently

4280.159 --> 4283.759999999999
ordered

4281.28 --> 4286.8
another package and it's so much better

4283.76 --> 4291.4400000000005
than any kind of cigarettes or

4286.8 --> 4295.360000000001
sale general sale to ba yeah tobacco

4291.44 --> 4297.678999999999
it's a whole different way of smoking

4295.36 --> 4299.759999999999
it does take some more work because you

4297.679 --> 4303.36
have to cut up the leaves

4299.76 --> 4306.0
but it's just so so much nicer

4303.36 --> 4308.08
much better less problems with breathing

4306.0 --> 4310.48
and all that

4308.08 --> 4312.84
bro sanchez i'm not gonna collaborate

4310.48 --> 4316.879999999999
with bro sanchez

4312.84 --> 4327.84
but if he's interested he can

4316.88 --> 4332.400000000001
contact me and everything

4327.84 --> 4332.400000000001
america's way better than canadian okay

4340.56 --> 4346.0
bro sanchez is like a

4343.6 --> 4347.04
a flat earther for from like the second

4346.0 --> 4349.04
wave

4347.04 --> 4351.679
from some time ago i haven't seen him in

4349.04 --> 4351.679
a long time

4354.239 --> 4357.839999999999
would it

4359.199 --> 4361.5199999999995
maybe

4363.36 --> 4371.199
but yeah i do not really team up easily

4367.6 --> 4373.76
i'm like in a bigger group i can

4371.199 --> 4374.96
get in there but just like a two team or

4373.76 --> 4385.4400000000005
a duo

4374.96 --> 4387.92
i'm not really that type overall

4385.44 --> 4388.719
i'm either like a panelist or a free

4387.92 --> 4392.32
agent

4388.719 --> 4395.199
but i can do like situations

4392.32 --> 4396.32
interviews it's just like having it

4395.199 --> 4399.759999999999
keeping it going

4396.32 --> 4404.4
long term i don't know

4399.76 --> 4404.400000000001
i don't know if that would be

4410.84 --> 4413.84
sustainable

4418.4 --> 4422.159
does real tobacco have maces i don't

4420.8 --> 4426.0
know what that is

4422.159 --> 4428.08
but i'm gonna round out the show now

4426.0 --> 4429.6
yeah flat earth is so down to the bottom

4428.08 --> 4432.0
of the barrel because

4429.6 --> 4434.159000000001
we've already won the earth is not a

4432.0 --> 4436.159
globe you have no arguments

4434.159 --> 4438.239
so yeah then we end up just talking

4436.159 --> 4441.44
about tobacco

4438.239 --> 4444.639999999999
and collaborations with other people and

4441.44 --> 4448.239
medical issues yeah because

4444.64 --> 4448.2390000000005
we won that's why

4452.239 --> 4456.48
there's nothing you could do about it as

4453.84 --> 4459.12
a globe except complain until

4456.48 --> 4459.5199999999995
irrelevant we are always so dead no we

4459.12 --> 4463.04
won

4459.52 --> 4463.040000000001
we want every argument

4463.76 --> 4469.92
but keep dreaming on

4467.28 --> 4471.599999999999
