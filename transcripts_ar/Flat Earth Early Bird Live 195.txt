[Music]

37.76 --> 45.269999999999996
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.67 --> 47.579
early-bird number 195 I'm your host

45.27 --> 49.68000000000001
Arwen and before I start to show please

don't forget to share it on any platform

49.68 --> 54.69
you deem fit and also if you haven't

52.47 --> 56.309
already subscribed to my channel and hit

54.69 --> 58.11
the bell notification so you know when

56.309 --> 58.47
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

58.11 --> 61.29
p.m.

58.47 --> 65.52
Amsterdam time although today I was a

61.29 --> 70.759
little late as I had a phone call yes

65.52 --> 74.369
today the weather is kind of grey and

70.759 --> 76.86
windy but it's weird because it's still

74.369 --> 83.85
very warm it's actually warm and moist

76.86 --> 86.28
and yeah with the continual thick wind

83.85 --> 90.83
but that's what it's a warm wind it's

86.28 --> 93.3
just strange weather kind of tiresome

90.83 --> 97.7
but yeah I feel great

93.3 --> 100.59
like really good because I just had an

97.7 --> 104.28
unexpected phone call back from my

100.59 --> 113.13
healer and yeah he cleared some things

104.28 --> 120.229
up so I just feel like perfectly me it's

113.13 --> 122.82
really nice so let's see who's in chat

120.229 --> 125.07
all right this drunken bullet for one

122.82 --> 129.929
one righteous forced glass shot a gem

125.07 --> 132.59
and my UK is MacLeod they like Ohio good

129.929 --> 132.59
to see you all

134.31 --> 145.659
yeah I have pretty heavy hang out

141.549 --> 148.87
yesterday with Jose I was gonna repost

145.659 --> 150.849
it but yeah I haven't yeah there was a

148.87 --> 153.84900000000002
big editing thing and there was a lot of

150.849 --> 156.39999999999998
stuff after that I didn't really care

153.849 --> 159.849
about too much and I was kind of getting

156.4 --> 162.09900000000002
really really shoddy for those who

159.849 --> 167.29
haven't noticed so yeah I went on Jose's

162.099 --> 169.58999999999997
yesterday I was like oh amped up it was

167.29 --> 169.59
weird

170.549 --> 180.19
and I was like that all day I had like

175.51 --> 184.12
huge strength as in like wanted to

180.19 --> 187.15
engage like very seriously interface and

184.12 --> 192.269
in that sense yeah my own show I cut a

187.15 --> 195.97
bit was a bit restless and basically

192.269 --> 198.519
didn't go on for too long but then yeah

195.97 --> 200.29
Jose's came on and I was like oh yeah

198.519 --> 202.06
I just knew it like I'm gonna get on

200.29 --> 203.53
there and I immediately jumped in chat

202.06 --> 208.09
like yeah I'm ready I'm gonna do this

203.53 --> 209.709
and he yeah the guy you have to

208.09 --> 212.139
appreciate he really does kind of treat

209.709 --> 215.62
me as a VIP like he really sees me and

212.139 --> 218.29000000000002
he's like oh yeah I'll get you in and I

215.62 --> 220.54
had a really good start with a baller

218.29 --> 225.129
guy that I didn't really know who was

220.54 --> 228.91
really well-spoken he was like yeah nice

225.129 --> 230.709
British accent and very detailed and he

228.91 --> 234.16
asked me a lot of questions and they

230.709 --> 237.19
were pretty decent questions and I

234.16 --> 240.069
really had the the nice chance to give

237.19 --> 242.859
elaborate explanations the funny thing

240.069 --> 244.44899999999998
is I kind of run past it to be fair what

242.859 --> 245.739
I did it to give her framework and

244.449 --> 247.78
that's kind of the same what rumpus

245.739 --> 251.26
tries as well but he does a lot of

247.78 --> 253.72
trickery stuff switcheroos I don't do

251.26 --> 255.519
that so I did kind of like not answer

253.72 --> 259.0
the first couple of questions straight

255.519 --> 263.2
out and much more elaborately made a

259.0 --> 264.789
groundwork but that I eventually just

263.2 --> 266.74
straight out answered the question so

264.789 --> 269.09999999999997
once I got the chance to say that

266.74 --> 274.33
and it was a really good conversation

269.1 --> 277.72
sensible and then event eventually other

274.33 --> 280.389
people Dovan and then Sean started

277.72 --> 285.75
getting in and you know what happened

280.389 --> 289.90000000000003
after that I was like no this is a great

285.75 --> 293.65
hangout I loved this part and I don't

289.9 --> 295.38899999999995
want this guy to just ruin the entire

293.65 --> 297.96999999999997
atmosphere because he does that every

295.389 --> 299.919
single time and so yeah it basically

297.97 --> 303.699
started like yeah I stay out of this

299.919 --> 306.49
like shut the hell up like really hard

303.699 --> 311.56
handed like dominate like yeah shut the

306.49 --> 313.87
[ __ ] up and get in the corner treating

311.56 --> 317.169
him like a goblin which he deserves and

313.87 --> 325.24
it may sort of work sometimes because

317.169 --> 328.24
the guy is not a he's just gone so yeah

325.24 --> 331.599
but he eventually didn't shut up and I

328.24 --> 336.34000000000003
just basically went fall in are witty in

331.599 --> 339.729
rage but not because I was getting

336.34 --> 341.32
really hurt or something because that is

339.729 --> 345.34
yeah like yeah I get it

341.32 --> 348.19
it happened I have that side as well but

345.34 --> 350.71
I was just like no I'm gonna freakin

348.19 --> 355.449
dominate this guy and you gotta push him

350.71 --> 357.69899999999996
out like I'm no mercy like a lot of

355.449 --> 361.65000000000003
people a lot of ballers like even Brenda

357.699 --> 367.87
times has like redeemable qualities it

361.65 --> 369.909
just just it makes it durable sometimes

367.87 --> 373.06
and Pete Mars goes the same Pete Mars

369.909 --> 375.4
had a great piece on the Jose show as

373.06 --> 378.61
well especially when I once I like

375.4 --> 381.69
pushed Sean out of it it was a great

378.61 --> 385.36
conversation about free speech and

381.69 --> 388.21
what's ballsy and Pete Mars was in a

385.36 --> 391.389
momentum it was fantastic what had

388.21 --> 393.75899999999996
really big respect for that like okay

391.389 --> 396.669
yeah that guy is a freak sometimes any

393.759 --> 398.61
porn bomb me but I gotta give some

396.669 --> 402.94
respect to what he did

398.61 --> 405.22
so but yeah Sean again every time Jose

402.94 --> 407.92
open up a new panel he jumps back in

405.22 --> 409.75
there and I just had to just again do

407.92 --> 414.55
the same thing like piss off and again

409.75 --> 420.28
pisses off after some shouting and not a

414.55 --> 422.02000000000004
little but eventually yeah again it

420.28 --> 425.10999999999996
happened and I was just like yeah I'm

422.02 --> 428.65
I'm not gonna do it over again people

425.11 --> 432.61
get it now and I had a good conversation

428.65 --> 439.0
after it all ended over Skype with Jose

432.61 --> 441.25
and yeah I think we're on level like you

439.0 --> 444.55
know we had our differences in the past

441.25 --> 445.48
and he still is Jose the the flat earth

444.55 --> 448.69
betrayer

445.48 --> 451.09000000000003
yeah yeah once you have that you can

448.69 --> 455.26
never lose it really but the weight of

451.09 --> 460.96
it it's much less because he's really

455.26 --> 464.77
trying to be a good show host a tolerant

460.96 --> 469.12
open amusing show host and can step away

464.77 --> 471.7
from opinions and yeah when you're like

469.12 --> 473.65
a panelist that's annoying but when

471.7 --> 477.76
you're a show host and you really have a

473.65 --> 480.60999999999996
lot of managing to do it you do it with

477.76 --> 483.64
principle and try to find a frequency

480.61 --> 486.16
for the entire thing and he does that he

483.64 --> 488.74
has the instinct he has talent for it

486.16 --> 492.21000000000004
then yeah he's doing something good with

488.74 --> 497.169
what he was instead of being useless and

492.21 --> 499.87
I gotta respect that and I I will

497.169 --> 502.15
definitely enjoy at times when I feel

499.87 --> 504.19
like I did yesterday to get on there

502.15 --> 506.94
again and just dive straight be in

504.19 --> 509.89
between ballers and especially these

506.94 --> 512.229
these well-spoken ones I really like

509.89 --> 514.27
those conversations like I don't know

512.229 --> 516.07
maybe it is almost like a weird thing

514.27 --> 518.669
but I like really like those

516.07 --> 523.87
conversations it's weird

518.669 --> 527.16
maybe that's just me because they test

523.87 --> 527.16
me and I'm

528.61 --> 538.67
I'm trying to honor the quality of their

535.66 --> 541.55
their beliefs basically in the detail of

538.67 --> 544.64
it and not necessarily try to kick them

541.55 --> 548.0799999999999
out of it constantly but just as on the

544.64 --> 551.72
level try to approach them and show them

548.08 --> 555.62
what the thing is that they believe with

551.72 --> 559.6700000000001
love but show them like yeah it's like

555.62 --> 561.59
this really really awesome chick that is

559.67 --> 566.63
so beautiful and so talented

561.59 --> 571.19
and she's like perfect but if you really

566.63 --> 574.1899999999999
like start to pay attention and you see

571.19 --> 576.2900000000001
what she's doing or like what she does

574.19 --> 580.22
when she thinks nobody's looking then

576.29 --> 584.42
you find out like oh [ __ ] she's an actor

580.22 --> 586.88
and that really crushes people and

584.42 --> 589.01
sometimes it crushes them so hard and I

586.88 --> 590.9
had this personally that you literally

589.01 --> 596.36
forget about it because she just can't

590.9 --> 599.72
bear to you just make it more risky to

596.36 --> 601.76
yourself but you can't let that illusion

599.72 --> 604.01
break you gotta believe in that because

601.76 --> 608.27
it's just too beautiful and I think that

604.01 --> 610.22
I think that from a more personal level

608.27 --> 612.8299999999999
if you can have that trust basis with

610.22 --> 616.39
these very smart educated people which

612.83 --> 616.39
they still are they they have

617.05 --> 621.29
perspective problem like personal

619.4 --> 625.0699999999999
perspective problems in the whole thing

621.29 --> 625.6999999999999
but they are very meticulous and you got

625.07 --> 628.87
to respect that

625.7 --> 637.37
with some of them with few of them

628.87 --> 640.3100000000001
and yeah I just think that we could get

637.37 --> 644.8100000000001
like really good alliance

640.31 --> 650.4399999999999
kind of stalemate out of it where we can

644.81 --> 653.8399999999999
have these great conversations from in

650.44 --> 658.34
between Flat Earth and the ball that's

653.84 --> 661.76
kind of it like in between it and really

658.34 --> 666.01
build on the structures as Cosmo genus

661.76 --> 672.35
not as a polarized set model believer

666.01 --> 676.31
eventually Cosmo Geneva yay I love it

672.35 --> 679.58
you know this so yeah that is kind that

676.31 --> 683.66
is my personal long-term hope and vision

679.58 --> 685.07
for the for yeah for this community what

683.66 --> 686.66
the ballers and the flat earthers and

685.07 --> 688.6400000000001
there's still a lot of people that I

686.66 --> 691.0699999999999
will kind of like exclude because

688.64 --> 693.79
they're just too disruptive it really

691.07 --> 699.2
all depends on being able to uphold this

693.79 --> 701.48
this good refined energy the

699.2 --> 703.5200000000001
conversation and atmosphere that's

701.48 --> 705.95
essential for that to work if there's

703.52 --> 710.51
disruptive elements it'll be lost

705.95 --> 711.6700000000001
it's like beautiful butterflies and

710.51 --> 714.4399999999999
birds

711.67 --> 716.93
yeah suddenly a bunch of stampeding

714.44 --> 719.2700000000001
mooses come running through yeah they're

716.93 --> 723.2299999999999
all gonna scatter and you're just going

719.27 --> 729.46
to see the mooses you know that's that's

723.23 --> 729.46
the effect or some symbolically so

730.78 --> 744.02
right let's see let's get back I am open

739.49 --> 745.34
for panelists I have a test levels

744.02 --> 750.85
betrayal burn him

745.34 --> 758.11
yeah now he was kind of sneaky and

750.85 --> 758.11
betrayus but I don't know seen worse

765.33 --> 771.3000000000001
let's just say I'm oh wait no that's

768.26 --> 779.67
Neff not gonna say that that would come

771.3 --> 780.8399999999999
out so bad yeah but I say yeah I you

779.67 --> 787.3499999999999
know them by their fruits

780.84 --> 791.46
and hey I guess sometimes a tree can

787.35 --> 794.94
have a bad harvest season or can have

791.46 --> 797.1
some issues but then they can recover

794.94 --> 799.1400000000001
from it and if you just don't chop them

797.1 --> 804.03
down right away and just leave him and

799.14 --> 807.26
like like I hope they recover then they

804.03 --> 810.3
may recover and still give great fruit

807.26 --> 813.15
maybe not as originally expected but

810.3 --> 813.78
with the unique different quality that

813.15 --> 817.0699999999999
kind of thing

813.78 --> 817.0699999999999
so yeah

820.73 --> 827.1800000000001
the English dude yeah they lie Oh higher

824.39 --> 829.76
the English dude yeah I I didn't

827.18 --> 832.01
directly invite him I kind of left at

829.76 --> 835.37
some point but I think he was even there

832.01 --> 841.6
anymore but I did ask Jose to basically

835.37 --> 844.19
tell him that he's welcome on my show so

841.6 --> 846.5500000000001
technically yes I did invite him I don't

844.19 --> 849.8000000000001
know if the message got through yet I

846.55 --> 857.81
haven't received an email as far as I've

849.8 --> 860.7199999999999
seen yeah yeah ace MacLeod there is no

857.81 --> 863.63
more link I'm not using the Google panel

860.72 --> 870.2
system anymore it's become too

863.63 --> 872.3
unreliable I am just you doing things

870.2 --> 876.83
from now on basically through Skype and

872.3 --> 879.9799999999999
it works just fine with much less issues

876.83 --> 881.75
and more stable platform because it

879.98 --> 883.73
basically allows me to also communicate

881.75 --> 886.22
with people that I get on panels with

883.73 --> 889.37
before and afterward and that's good and

886.22 --> 892.07
I can keep contact ask invite them

889.37 --> 895.49
specifically if I have certain setup in

892.07 --> 897.86
mind so I like yeah I have been doing it

895.49 --> 900.44
basically through Skype a lot then I

897.86 --> 905.45
decided open panel using the the Hangout

900.44 --> 909.73
system now and then yeah you know what

905.45 --> 909.73
happened and I'm just doing Skype

917.709 --> 925.5999999999999
where is everyone oh right uh no I'm not

922.6 --> 929.769
gonna try this Gordon just seriously

925.6 --> 933.129
just the name of it and from things that

929.769 --> 938.92
I've heard and people say about it

933.129 --> 941.769
no things and I have tried some time

938.92 --> 944.8789999999999
before in the earlier days and it

941.769 --> 948.85
screwed up my computer like literally I

944.879 --> 954.999
had to reinstall everything like pretty

948.85 --> 961.7090000000001
quickly after so no this is just I am

954.999 --> 968.23
taking it as an omen I am are you saying

961.709 --> 970.7199999999999
principally very almost technophobic

968.23 --> 973.179
when it comes to using platforms like I

970.72 --> 975.22
am very careful not to just oh yeah a

973.179 --> 978.91
new thing I'm gonna be on there no

975.22 --> 982.149
always been like that because it's just

978.91 --> 984.009
not good it's not good for me to do that

982.149 --> 987.279
to just get on everything I'll

984.009 --> 989.519
completely lose track and I got sick of

987.279 --> 989.519
it

992.41 --> 1004.51
so no discord for our women only harmony

1001.65 --> 1012.63
and a bit of our weenie enrage at times

1004.51 --> 1018.67
maybe so discord could be witchcraft

1012.63 --> 1021.55
well no but I wouldn't be surprised if

1018.67 --> 1026.28
there's some really bad witch he types

1021.55 --> 1026.28
also fooling around on this chord

1026.67 --> 1032.5500000000002
wouldn't be surprised at all the name

1029.83 --> 1032.55
after all

1044.98 --> 1050.57
yeah

1046.22 --> 1052.94
no no I'm perfectly fine with this Skype

1050.57 --> 1055.04
is great I already have so many contacts

1052.94 --> 1057.26
that technically and I don't hope that

1055.04 --> 1060.92
it ever happens but technically what

1057.26 --> 1063.47
YouTube just stopped or there would no

1060.92 --> 1065.45
longer be any live streaming capability

1063.47 --> 1068.05
for some reason might be like abrupt

1065.45 --> 1073.6100000000001
because of yeah management change or

1068.05 --> 1078.2
some crackdown punishments and then I'll

1073.61 --> 1080.6899999999998
just switch the the Skype and I have so

1078.2 --> 1086.38
many people there and I could then just

1080.69 --> 1092.8700000000001
do livestream purely through Skype and

1086.38 --> 1095.179
then upload it so yeah Skype I got a

1092.87 --> 1098.2099999999998
giant platform with so many people I

1095.179 --> 1101.96
don't even remember them all must be in

1098.21 --> 1104.66
the hundreds now so but I try to kind of

1101.96 --> 1106.76
keep contact I always do pay attention

1104.66 --> 1110.1200000000001
if people do address me again even

1106.76 --> 1112.52
though I do not address you I will if

1110.12 --> 1119.059
you address me I will definitely address

1112.52 --> 1122.84
you back although if you're immediately

1119.059 --> 1125.69
gonna bring a giant page of complex sets

1122.84 --> 1132.02
of questions and everything don't expect

1125.69 --> 1134.22
a complete answer because I kind of yeah

1132.02 --> 1137.58
I have life

1134.22 --> 1139.65
and not that neurotic that I will answer

1137.58 --> 1142.8899999999999
though yeah and that's kind of goes for

1139.65 --> 1145.74
Daniel as well I read his email and it

1142.89 --> 1153.71
was interesting but again it was like a

1145.74 --> 1158.43
3/4 page text pretty it was okay written

1153.71 --> 1163.44
but yeah complaints about John's

1158.43 --> 1166.65
scientific method and everything and

1163.44 --> 1168.27
there was for at first glance I didn't

1166.65 --> 1170.13
and I have to be fair I didn't really

1168.27 --> 1175.53
read it all through I didn't look at one

1170.13 --> 1177.66
of the links it was a online information

1175.53 --> 1179.31
library concerning the scientific method

1177.66 --> 1183.47
and that's interesting I haven't looked

1179.31 --> 1186.3
in it because it's huge like a cod but

1183.47 --> 1188.79
I've put it out there in the in the

1186.3 --> 1191.04
Skype so the other people could have

1188.79 --> 1194.76
read it read it like in the master be

1191.04 --> 1198.03
and it's well worth looking into over

1194.76 --> 1199.86
time but as for the the things that

1198.03 --> 1202.43
Daniel himself said I don't know I

1199.86 --> 1206.25
wasn't too impressed at first glance

1202.43 --> 1210.93
so I expected that you really like found

1206.25 --> 1214.5
new very specific important quotes or

1210.93 --> 1217.6200000000001
anything that would completely derail

1214.5 --> 1223.56
the quotes for example used by quantum

1217.62 --> 1226.9199999999998
eraser well I did they were not there so

1223.56 --> 1233.58
it seemed a bit more like emotion

1226.92 --> 1236.3400000000001
towards it but no actual no real payoff

1233.58 --> 1238.5
really that's the feeling I get but I am

1236.34 --> 1244.55
gonna read it more elaborate Daniel so

1238.5 --> 1244.55
don't worry about that just yeah

1248.01 --> 1257.52
hmm oh yeah I got a calzone today a

1251.1 --> 1261.01
regular one it's gonna be nice and I got

1257.52 --> 1263.98
tea of course now Tamera coffee today I

1261.01 --> 1270.25
actually tried it in this morning to

1263.98 --> 1273.04
start with and I don't know I didn't

1270.25 --> 1276.13
really like it to start with that I

1273.04 --> 1282.49
don't know it was weird it just the

1276.13 --> 1285.16
spiciness was like too much it's yeah I

1282.49 --> 1287.89
don't know why it didn't really feel bad

1285.16 --> 1289.69
or anything but I just didn't I think

1287.89 --> 1293.1100000000001
I'm gonna stick to just regular coffee

1289.69 --> 1294.8500000000001
in the morning and then yeah Tamera

1293.11 --> 1296.29
coffee during the show because yeah

1294.85 --> 1298.87
every time I take it during the show

1296.29 --> 1304.12
it's been great but when you start out

1298.87 --> 1308.85
in the morning with it it wasn't really

1304.12 --> 1308.85
great weird anyway

1311.2 --> 1317.3700000000001
[Music]

1314.0 --> 1319.19
and that wind just keeps on blowing out

1317.37 --> 1322.2489999999998
there

1319.19 --> 1322.249
[Music]

1338.78 --> 1351.17
yeah but still I am a here in my t-shirt

1341.54 --> 1355.25
and it's just perfectly warm so I do

1351.17 --> 1358.78
remember it's kind of similar to early

1355.25 --> 1362.38
summer days in Spain on the East Coast

1358.78 --> 1368.51
when I've yeah when I was younger like

1362.38 --> 1373.6000000000001
in my yeah even starting in my in my

1368.51 --> 1376.28
preteens but up until my early 20s I

1373.6 --> 1378.74
went on vacation with the family there a

1376.28 --> 1382.73
lot and there were these times it

1378.74 --> 1384.56
usually was just sunny maybe a couple of

1382.73 --> 1386.93
clouds but usually just sunny but

1384.56 --> 1390.3799999999999
sometimes it would be like this as well

1386.93 --> 1392.8100000000002
just warm winds really moist and clouds

1390.38 --> 1396.41
everywhere but it would be warm and this

1392.81 --> 1400.1799999999998
weather really reminds me of that it's

1396.41 --> 1403.3400000000001
not bad you know at least it's not cold

1400.18 --> 1408.76
but maybe maybe this type of weather

1403.34 --> 1408.76
does make you a bit hazy like

1410.9 --> 1414.7
I don't know if you don't have really

1412.52 --> 1418.91
something really active to do I think

1414.7 --> 1420.98
yeah you would normally get a tendency

1418.91 --> 1426.5800000000002
to kind of fall asleep from it it's

1420.98 --> 1426.58
weird what

1430.23 --> 1433.73
you guys are getting weird

1453.21 --> 1459.359
yeah righteous force ball-busters is

1457.08 --> 1463.109
doing the same because they're having

1459.359 --> 1467.039
their issues everybody's having issues

1463.109 --> 1478.369
with google hangout like the last time i

1467.039 --> 1481.799
saw some of patricia and sorry it's bad

1478.369 --> 1485.2189999999998
that yeah on the feathers and other hot

1481.799 --> 1486.929
potatoes patricia steer and she was with

1485.219 --> 1491.519
mark sergeant and another guy I think

1486.929 --> 1494.3300000000002
and then yeah they couldn't hear each

1491.519 --> 1497.099
other or one couldn't hear the other

1494.33 --> 1499.379
exactly that and then that issue I have

1497.099 --> 1501.839
been starting to getting that starting

1499.379 --> 1505.609
to get that like two or three months ago

1501.839 --> 1509.149
first started randomly happening and

1505.609 --> 1511.649
it's not going away it's getting worse

1509.149 --> 1515.9399999999998
so yeah the Google hangout system is

1511.649 --> 1519.5089999999998
just breaking down it's not yeah there's

1515.94 --> 1523.8790000000001
something wrong with it and nobody's

1519.509 --> 1523.879
touching it nobody nobody's fixing it

1526.75 --> 1532.52
yeah it's kind of sad on the other hand

1530.63 --> 1536.2700000000002
they did kind of announce that they

1532.52 --> 1539.24
would stop updating it and just let it

1536.27 --> 1542.6299999999999
be they did literally announce it it was

1539.24 --> 1549.32
even shared on the flat earth another

1542.63 --> 1551.5700000000002
hot potato show last year so we're gonna

1549.32 --> 1553.58
have to eventually use other systems for

1551.57 --> 1556.75
that but as long as YouTube keeps going

1553.58 --> 1556.75
then that's okay

1572.24 --> 1582.54
classic version is being replaced hmm

1577.55 --> 1584.76
okay wait yeah right so it's the other

1582.54 --> 1588.32
system where you basically can snipe at

1584.76 --> 1588.32
all right

1592.63 --> 1598.8090000000002
yeah that's well when you use that

1595.269 --> 1600.49
system you get the Jose effect it's why

1598.809 --> 1602.47
how he manages his show and that's

1600.49 --> 1602.799
basically eventually everything turns to

1602.47 --> 1605.259
[ __ ]

1602.799 --> 1606.94
everybody starts shouting you drop the

1605.259 --> 1611.1390000000001
panel you start a new ones the only way

1606.94 --> 1617.529
to do it I I don't really like that

1611.139 --> 1619.7199999999998
setup because it it makes it it it makes

1617.529 --> 1622.899
it even more troll Beatty like the

1619.72 --> 1625.69
trolls would because they can ruin it

1622.899 --> 1627.9399999999998
and they can hasten that [ __ ] so I don't

1625.69 --> 1631.75
like that kind of setup for for what I

1627.94 --> 1634.0
do I don't want to go there that snipe

1631.75 --> 1644.37
function is very important to me for

1634.0 --> 1644.37
control hmm but what can you do

1650.46 --> 1661.04
I should time you out for that Cleary

1657.11 --> 1661.04
just for the thought of that

1678.19 --> 1684.8400000000001
oh yeah yeah I've been starting to

1681.34 --> 1691.27
watching you shear your Netflix

1684.84 --> 1694.09
basically sort of drama bass still in

1691.27 --> 1695.53
the earthy yeah it's like kind of

1694.09 --> 1697.3899999999999
interesting acting but I'm already

1695.53 --> 1702.49
getting a feel of it like oh god this is

1697.39 --> 1703.69
gonna be a typical Netflix eerie but I'm

1702.49 --> 1707.86
gonna watch through it

1703.69 --> 1709.45
overtime it's still kind of abusing but

1707.86 --> 1713.05
not really special or science fiction

1709.45 --> 1714.88
related because if yeah that were the

1713.05 --> 1716.97
case if I find something really new

1714.88 --> 1720.0100000000002
interesting science fiction related or

1716.97 --> 1725.47
something interesting to flat earth in

1720.01 --> 1729.1299999999999
some way I will definitely notify my

1725.47 --> 1739.42
public on the flatter the early bird

1729.13 --> 1742.15
show as you all know all right ace

1739.42 --> 1746.5600000000002
MacLeod yeah that's right I even wrote

1742.15 --> 1750.76
down that quote yeah I finally figured

1746.56 --> 1755.25
out what the fabric of space-time is it

1750.76 --> 1757.87
is a it is basically a trampoline

1755.25 --> 1760.75
space-time is a trampoline so the fabric

1757.87 --> 1765.31
of space trip the fabric fabric of

1760.75 --> 1767.89
space-time is basically what a

1765.31 --> 1769.75
trampoline is made of so we can

1767.89 --> 1772.2700000000002
conceptualize that the fabric of

1769.75 --> 1776.32
space-time is like a trampoline it must

1772.27 --> 1781.78
be have elasticity so that's a clue as

1776.32 --> 1784.09
to a certain type of function or ability

1781.78 --> 1790.81
that we can pursue to see if there are

1784.09 --> 1793.53
elements like that right did this get

1790.81 --> 1798.3
kind of science fictiony overkill right

1793.53 --> 1800.8
so the fabric of space-time trampoline

1798.3 --> 1802.99
that's what they use right that proved

1800.8 --> 1804.6699999999998
how the supposed orbit is the bedding of

1802.99 --> 1808.529
space-time like a trampoline and that

1804.67 --> 1813.6290000000001
trampoline is the gravity versus the

1808.529 --> 1813.629
the space-time blah it's a trampoline

1820.31 --> 1823.06
hmm

1825.79 --> 1835.6299999999999
okay righteous force I guess that's a

1830.26 --> 1849.01
weird thing to say you suggest that I

1835.63 --> 1853.75
wear space-time like clothing I don't

1849.01 --> 1856.51
know my clothing is not that alas this

1853.75 --> 1862.56
is not that elastic really it's not that

1856.51 --> 1862.56
flexible so I don't think that works

1881.49 --> 1884.809
all right yeah

1891.17 --> 1898.91
oh but hold on they lie Ohio space is

1895.43 --> 1901.8200000000002
liquid but that's your space I'm talking

1898.91 --> 1904.8200000000002
specifically about space-time the fabric

1901.82 --> 1906.83
of space-time not space space is very

1904.82 --> 1909.1699999999998
definable but the space-time factor

1906.83 --> 1912.07
that's really that's the fourth

1909.17 --> 1915.49
dimensional angle to it so what is that

1912.07 --> 1919.6699999999998
well it's kind of rubbery because

1915.49 --> 1921.8
space-time is a trampoline as they

1919.67 --> 1923.5700000000002
always demonstrate it's like the only

1921.8 --> 1930.61
demonstration they really have to give

1923.57 --> 1930.61
for it see how that works

1952.03 --> 1959.12
all right

1954.44 --> 1962.89
well I don't know what is up there but I

1959.12 --> 1962.8899999999999
do know there is something up there I

1966.37 --> 1975.56
think just a lot of gas is the most

1970.37 --> 1980.9299999999998
likely and I don't know for how long it

1975.56 --> 1983.51
will go on could be very long even

1980.93 --> 1987.14
though it may be very hard or almost

1983.51 --> 1992.36
impossible to even get there to however

1987.14 --> 1995.0
far that goes I don't know but yeah it

1992.36 --> 1999.1699999999998
could be a barrier of some kind it could

1995.0 --> 2002.86
be hard it could be weird liquid you

1999.17 --> 2004.9
know that's the silly thing again it's

2002.86 --> 2011.35
almost annoying now to say but the

2004.9 --> 2013.96
unicorn far theory a gas that has very

2011.35 --> 2016.51
low density but a very high surface

2013.96 --> 2019.06
tension just like a liquid but a

2016.51 --> 2025.51
naturally high surface tension so almost

2019.06 --> 2028.4199999999998
elastic like and yeah that could be up

2025.51 --> 2032.8
there I don't know yeah that's just

2028.42 --> 2034.42
silly I don't know what is up there but

2032.8 --> 2036.37
there is something up there and there's

2034.42 --> 2040.0600000000002
definitely not nothing out there there's

2036.37 --> 2043.6
not a vacuum up there there a vacuum

2040.06 --> 2047.98
directly next to gas within a container

2043.6 --> 2050.89
that doesn't happen there's the gradient

2047.98 --> 2054.28
there's pressure divisions but that

2050.89 --> 2058.24
division that gradient settles in a very

2054.28 --> 2061.03
specific spectrum a very specific

2058.24 --> 2063.6299999999997
pattern that can be analyzed the

2061.03 --> 2067.4100000000003
pressure the gradient is not a linear

2063.63 --> 2069.55
gradient that just pops off at a zero

2067.41 --> 2071.5899999999997
that doesn't happen that's not the

2069.55 --> 2076.44
pattern of the statistics of the

2071.59 --> 2076.44
pressure versus height it's actually

2077.33 --> 2084.71
the higher you go the more distance it

2081.77 --> 2088.22
takes for the pressure to basically go

2084.71 --> 2090.83
down and that's the effect that is you

2088.22 --> 2093.399
have to statistically analyze that and I

2090.83 --> 2096.11
got into that on houses yesterday and

2093.399 --> 2100.54
then you will know that there will be at

2096.11 --> 2104.33
no point ever a vacuum not even close

2100.54 --> 2107.93
it's just gonna be lower the gas

2104.33 --> 2115.61
pressure not even that much lower really

2107.93 --> 2118.37
in yen that's the outer gas universe but

2115.61 --> 2123.4100000000003
who knows maybe if the yeah maybe not a

2118.37 --> 2126.56
ball it's not gonna be around a ball but

2123.41 --> 2130.19
there might still be a big tunnel or

2126.56 --> 2138.11
tube or a looping confine that may go up

2130.19 --> 2141.23
very high incredibly far insanely far we

2138.11 --> 2143.84
don't know although yeah if we could

2141.23 --> 2146.06
never find out how far it could go if it

2143.84 --> 2149.53
was technically impossible even by

2146.06 --> 2151.88
spirit or however bizarre hyper

2149.53 --> 2153.92
futuristic way we could conceptualize if

2151.88 --> 2157.75
it was impossible would you ever know if

2153.92 --> 2162.02
it had an end just because it had to

2157.75 --> 2167.68
yeah that's science fiction speculation

2162.02 --> 2167.68
but you don't know how high up it goes

2167.74 --> 2174.68
until you actually touch it it's like

2172.22 --> 2176.81
where's the edge now not the edge of the

2174.68 --> 2182.27
of the pancake earth in outer space but

2176.81 --> 2187.31
where is the edge of where this this

2182.27 --> 2191.8
atmosphere stops where's the edge that's

2187.31 --> 2191.7999999999997
my question that's my edge question

2198.599 --> 2203.7400000000002
now there is there is Daniel you you

2201.339 --> 2210.819
obviously didn't listen to me at all I

2203.74 --> 2213.52
just told you the further way the

2210.819 --> 2218.98
distance becomes to the surface where

2213.52 --> 2223.69
the gas pressure is the highest the the

2218.98 --> 2225.97
slower the pressure goes down and this

2223.69 --> 2230.829
is exponential and that means it will

2225.97 --> 2234.9399999999996
never ever reach a vacuum not even close

2230.829 --> 2236.559
that is technically impossible that is

2234.94 --> 2239.079
statistically impossible that is

2236.559 --> 2242.26
mathematically impossible that is

2239.079 --> 2245.1090000000004
physically impossible it's impossible

2242.26 --> 2247.5400000000004
you can never demonstrate a vacuum next

2245.109 --> 2251.589
to gas pressure it within one container

2247.54 --> 2254.47
without a barrier in any setup and I've

2251.589 --> 2257.02
even elaborated on this concept like

2254.47 --> 2260.819
could you prove it or what if you have a

2257.02 --> 2263.98
an absurdly powerful centrifuge a

2260.819 --> 2268.0
contained centrifuge where you yeah I

2263.98 --> 2272.2
just spin it up gazillion rounds a

2268.0 --> 2274.059
second and then the centrifugal force

2272.2 --> 2276.1299999999997
will push everything including the gas

2274.059 --> 2280.7400000000002
to the edges and then would a vacuum

2276.13 --> 2283.2400000000002
come into being no never under no force

2280.74 --> 2286.839
subjected will there ever be a vacuum

2283.24 --> 2289.3289999999997
next to gas pressure it will definitely

2286.839 --> 2293.5589999999997
be lower gas pressure the gradient will

2289.329 --> 2296.17
be much more sharp but it's always gonna

2293.559 --> 2298.599
have life it's way over the distance

2296.17 --> 2306.01
every time so there will never be a

2298.599 --> 2308.049
vacuum no matter what happens now I'm

2306.01 --> 2311.9500000000003
not even gonna continue on with this

2308.049 --> 2316.2599999999998
Daniel there is never a vacuum next to

2311.95 --> 2316.2599999999998
gas pressure it doesn't exist

2316.8 --> 2326.07
I just explained you mathematically

2322.35 --> 2329.3399999999997
physically statistically how that works

2326.07 --> 2331.4700000000003
with examples of demonstrations of how

2329.34 --> 2333.78
you could test this there's never a

2331.47 --> 2337.7599999999998
vacuum next to gas pressure no matter

2333.78 --> 2341.3100000000004
what you subject that gas pressure to

2337.76 --> 2345.42
without a barrier it will never reach

2341.31 --> 2354.32
that close to zero point that just

2345.42 --> 2356.76
doesn't happen oh really

2354.32 --> 2357.4500000000003
really Daniel you're starting to piss me

2356.76 --> 2360.7200000000003
off man

2357.45 --> 2364.41
it's just Dogma well why don't you come

2360.72 --> 2370.85
with your proof of gas pressure next to

2364.41 --> 2375.8999999999996
a vacuum without a container in between

2370.85 --> 2378.5099999999998
okay do it this is a housekeeping

2375.9 --> 2381.9900000000002
question basically although it's asked

2378.51 --> 2387.96
slightly differently but the same thing

2381.99 --> 2390.7799999999997
so go ahead then no more questions

2387.96 --> 2394.73
I want your your proof of this before

2390.78 --> 2394.73
you even continue this conversation

2409.19 --> 2416.78
Daniel you're a smart guy you've been

2413.109 --> 2420.47
following my show for a long time you

2416.78 --> 2423.26
should know better than to insult me by

2420.47 --> 2425.9599999999996
falling back in the same [ __ ] reel

2423.26 --> 2428.4500000000003
that I've literally with a fine comb

2425.96 --> 2431.329
tooth has been the railing meticulously

2428.45 --> 2434.18
and explaining exactly why is there

2431.329 --> 2437.7200000000003
white we shouldn't do that and you're

2434.18 --> 2442.3999999999996
doing it again I'm getting really pissed

2437.72 --> 2446.24
off here Daniel you should know better

2442.4 --> 2452.0
that is break the conditioning take the

2446.24 --> 2454.819
data don't take the D conclusions that

2452.0 --> 2457.19
they give you you have to figure it out

2454.819 --> 2464.599
and that you don't do it by falling back

2457.19 --> 2473.289
into opinions the in the same railroad

2464.599 --> 2476.569
again it's just don't do it man no AGM

2473.289 --> 2481.96
Daniel is not a troll he obviously is

2476.569 --> 2481.96
not a troll but he has issues

2487.64 --> 2492.8689999999997
he's been a great guest in my chat and

2490.859 --> 2494.49
he does ask good questions but now this

2492.869 --> 2499.069
is just terrible man you shouldn't do

2494.49 --> 2503.22
this I asked you to actually demonstrate

2499.069 --> 2505.829
gas pressure next to a vacuum within the

2503.22 --> 2509.48
same container and you can do with it

2505.829 --> 2511.8590000000004
whatever you want subject any bizarre

2509.48 --> 2516.029
astronomical level forces to it

2511.859 --> 2518.609
you can even emulate it if you like but

2516.029 --> 2520.77
you're gonna have to use an official

2518.609 --> 2522.72
license through emulator for that not

2520.77 --> 2526.319
some own mathematical set up that will

2522.72 --> 2528.24
exclude a lot no machinations and then

2526.319 --> 2530.609
demonstrate that it is technically

2528.24 --> 2533.52
possible to have gas pressure next to a

2530.609 --> 2536.9
vacuum within the same container it's

2533.52 --> 2539.7
physically impossible a gradient never

2536.9 --> 2542.609
Regas pressure gradient never reaches

2539.7 --> 2546.359
zero no matter the size of the container

2542.609 --> 2549.39
and the gradient even that we know the

2546.359 --> 2552.14
gas pressure within our realm the parts

2549.39 --> 2556.3799999999997
that we can actually measure and confirm

2552.14 --> 2559.97
shows there's a half-life over distance

2556.38 --> 2564.4500000000003
concerning the pressure and it doesn't

2559.97 --> 2567.24
linearly go down to zero it becomes more

2564.45 --> 2570.5589999999997
steep basically dies down slower so that

2567.24 --> 2573.3289999999997
means mathematically statistically and

2570.559 --> 2575.6400000000003
physically that it will never reach zero

2573.329 --> 2577.849
and I'm done repeating myself over this

2575.64 --> 2577.8489999999997
now

2584.42 --> 2590.63
hmm but it is good to bring it up again

2628.459 --> 2635.5989999999997
hmm disco song is great

2654.4 --> 2662.51
hey Nathan it's good to have a library

2658.97 --> 2664.8999999999996
of baller spoken quotes that literally

2662.51 --> 2668.1800000000003
contradict everything they say isn't it

2664.9 --> 2670.339
but to be fair they get in serious

2668.18 --> 2672.6189999999997
cognitive dissonance mode eventually

2670.339 --> 2676.43
like the most prime example being Brenda

2672.619 --> 2679.7000000000003
just completely flip-flopping and to be

2676.43 --> 2682.1299999999997
fair it is more driven by confusion than

2679.7 --> 2684.0789999999997
actual determination because they really

2682.13 --> 2686.15
lose track when you put them on the

2684.079 --> 2688.6600000000003
pressure it's really funny it's also

2686.15 --> 2691.279
funny that they try to be confident into

2688.66 --> 2694.1499999999996
keeping up this attitude like no we are

2691.279 --> 2697.22
under control when everyone in the world

2694.15 --> 2699.6800000000003
except for people that support them from

2697.22 --> 2702.3489999999997
a baller perspective knows that they're

2699.68 --> 2711.74
literally just cognitive dissonance in

2702.349 --> 2714.19
everyone's face to see but yeah that's

2711.74 --> 2714.1899999999996
what they do

2722.09 --> 2732.2400000000002
but it's not really much weight like if

2728.4 --> 2734.369
like for example compare what they say

2732.24 --> 2736.3799999999997
and I love it it's of course we should

2734.369 --> 2738.78
reference it even just to advertise our

2736.38 --> 2741.3900000000003
own shows and everything so yeah so

2738.78 --> 2743.7900000000004
don't forget to tell me for example that

2741.39 --> 2749.7
many of those quotes actually were made

2743.79 --> 2762.45
on my show okay it's a little are

2749.7 --> 2765.35
winning magic around but yeah it's not

2762.45 --> 2766.6699999999996
the same weight as when yeah a

2765.35 --> 2770.31
non-standard

2766.67 --> 2772.53
baller troll says something like that or

2770.31 --> 2774.869
somebody that really tries because for

2772.53 --> 2776.9700000000003
example Dee was it again the video the

2774.869 --> 2781.29
other day that you played on the debates

2776.97 --> 2783.9599999999996
Nathan about that prominent guy that

2781.29 --> 2787.5299999999997
explained to one of the youtubers how

2783.96 --> 2791.46
gravity is not really a force but you

2787.53 --> 2798.5400000000004
can treat it as if it is now that was

2791.46 --> 2801.84
that was a real guy he's not cognitive

2798.54 --> 2806.58
dissonance about it he knows and he's

2801.84 --> 2809.13
trying to be honest without breaking the

2806.58 --> 2811.97
spell and that is very admirable because

2809.13 --> 2815.1600000000003
weirdly in a way I kind of like

2811.97 --> 2818.7799999999997
borderline do that as well but it

2815.16 --> 2822.45
depends I can go in for offence required

2818.78 --> 2824.73
but that's not my standard approach so

2822.45 --> 2827.49
that guy that kind of quote has a whole

2824.73 --> 2831.3
different kind of way because that was

2827.49 --> 2835.02
not set under severe pressure that was

2831.3 --> 2836.7000000000003
something he thought out that's a real

2835.02 --> 2839.99
quote if you would call him on that is

2836.7 --> 2842.2799999999997
just ginormous the weight of that is

2839.99 --> 2844.58
we're still under estimating the weight

2842.28 --> 2844.5800000000004
of that

2845.66 --> 2856.46
yeah Jorge masseur indeed that was not a

2853.26 --> 2856.46
statement made under pressure

2875.7 --> 2881.52
quote mining

2878.43 --> 2886.6189999999997
oh really well we do care about it's a

2881.52 --> 2889.46
really nice reference so yeah feet oh

2886.619 --> 2889.46
yeah I eat

2904.099 --> 2922.6090000000004
alright quote mining quote memeing

2910.16 --> 2922.609
hashtag meifa keep on mining the means

2924.54 --> 2928.0299999999997
[Music]

2935.9 --> 2940.67
oh yeah dan coppered I definitely have

2938.749 --> 2945.259
an explanation of the day/night cycles

2940.67 --> 2949.4
without it being a globe definitely it's

2945.259 --> 2951.65
simply not a giant ball Sun for which

2949.4 --> 2954.23
the earth is a marble right next to it

2951.65 --> 2956.799
that has a day the night side because

2954.23 --> 2959.48
that is a pre conceptualization and

2956.799 --> 2963.68
you're in reality the earth is really

2959.48 --> 2966.049
flat and there is just in relation to

2963.68 --> 2970.069
the position of the earth there is the

2966.049 --> 2973.519
sunlight or the daylight and the night

2970.069 --> 2975.349
time and it really relates to the

2973.519 --> 2980.66
position of the earth where this light

2975.349 --> 2983.4990000000003
will be visible and it follows a

2980.66 --> 2983.499
specific pattern

2985.5 --> 2993.869
so yeah there you go it's not a huge

2991.2 --> 2995.609
bowl out there for which the earth would

2993.869 --> 3000.82
have to be a globe to have a day/night

2995.609 --> 3000.8199999999997
cycle so it works different anyway

3029.53 --> 3039.86
okay letters evidence about the linear

3035.05 --> 3045.17
concealment rate beyond the apparent

3039.86 --> 3048.71
horizon you know linear concealment rate

3045.17 --> 3051.83
over distance that's definitely sign a

3048.71 --> 3054.16
geometric or deducible sign of non

3051.83 --> 3057.74
curvature because that would require an

3054.16 --> 3060.35
exponential rate exponential consuming

3057.74 --> 3066.4399999999996
or obstruction rate if assumed there is

3060.35 --> 3069.08
a curve so that is my evidence may not

3066.44 --> 3071.96
be scientific evidence but it is

3069.08 --> 3078.19
definitely evidence based on empirical

3071.96 --> 3078.19
data and elaborated upon with geometry

3100.619 --> 3108.75
now of course that the way that all that

3106.15 --> 3111.549
works and with certain limitations

3108.75 --> 3114.099
concerning sight there's still the

3111.549 --> 3117.099
remote option that the earth might just

3114.099 --> 3119.44
be is slightly slightly slightly curved

3117.099 --> 3124.48
in some way that would just never be

3119.44 --> 3126.609
visually noticeable but yeah then would

3124.48 --> 3130.809
definitely not be the big lobe earth

3126.609 --> 3132.64
that we are presented the world to be it

3130.809 --> 3135.9700000000003
would be a totally different type of

3132.64 --> 3140.5589999999997
place it would be vast Jupiter sized as

3135.97 --> 3145.45
I say and nothing would be as they say

3140.559 --> 3148.869
it is very blatantly so but yeah bar

3145.45 --> 3153.1189999999997
that option there's just a chance that

3148.869 --> 3158.289
it may just actually be perfectly flat

3153.119 --> 3160.63
that's it no it's not fish should be

3158.289 --> 3163.63
noticeable that's that's optics actually

3160.63 --> 3165.549
and that's concerning sight there's all

3163.63 --> 3168.759
kinds of effects like looking over a

3165.549 --> 3172.509
flat surface the closer that the in

3168.759 --> 3174.46
proximity the observer is whether that

3172.509 --> 3177.22
be a camera or your eye to that flat

3174.46 --> 3180.19
surface then the flat surface itself

3177.22 --> 3182.519
will conceal things in the further

3180.19 --> 3185.23
distance over that flat surface

3182.519 --> 3187.9599999999996
even though autographic lee there is a

3185.23 --> 3190.66
straight line aside and that is one of

3187.96 --> 3193.75
these effects of optics and now of

3190.66 --> 3198.5389999999998
course we all heard Lewis yesterday brag

3193.75 --> 3202.39
on oh well on the globe we would have a

3198.539 --> 3204.4
curvature and this obstruction look in

3202.39 --> 3208.9
real life we have obstruction therefore

3204.4 --> 3211.869
it must be curvature well when provably

3208.9 --> 3216.13
looking over a flat surface you have

3211.869 --> 3218.92
obstruction so that entire argument was

3216.13 --> 3221.6800000000003
just completely pointless because you're

3218.92 --> 3223.75
going to have obstruction or in this

3221.68 --> 3225.549
case it's technically concealment but

3223.75 --> 3227.47
yeah you could call it obstruction

3225.549 --> 3229.509
there's no carving going on there's not

3227.47 --> 3231.0899999999997
something literally obstructing it but

3229.509 --> 3233.4900000000002
okay obstruction what

3231.09 --> 3237.03
there is obstruction looking over a

3233.49 --> 3239.0699999999997
perfectly flat surface so to assume that

3237.03 --> 3241.59
any obstruction must therefore be a

3239.07 --> 3244.01
curvature is idiotic because there is

3241.59 --> 3247.05
obstruction over a flat surface and

3244.01 --> 3249.7200000000003
that's just a fact and now they went all

3247.05 --> 3251.9700000000003
in like yeah but what causes that it can

3249.72 --> 3257.64
be a limited viewing angle it can be the

3251.97 --> 3259.77
resolution issue I don't know what to

3257.64 --> 3263.25
really say about that it they may have a

3259.77 --> 3265.23
point that it is alike but it's not

3263.25 --> 3269.51
complete there is something else going

3265.23 --> 3276.45
on but then I fall back on my argument

3269.51 --> 3279.8700000000003
that is it's there we can size up the

3276.45 --> 3283.62
phenomena the obstruction over height

3279.87 --> 3286.89
and every we can deduce how it how it

3283.62 --> 3288.69
appears to function visually very

3286.89 --> 3292.68
specifically it is there and it is

3288.69 --> 3294.96
always there on flat surfaces so what

3292.68 --> 3297.66
does it really matter what causes that

3294.96 --> 3302.55
effect we know it's there we can size it

3297.66 --> 3306.48
up that's kind of important to keep in

3302.55 --> 3311.6600000000003
the back of your mind when you do optics

3306.48 --> 3311.66
analysis of the world just saying

3321.53 --> 3330.8300000000004
if eat you're very annoying giving you

3329.27 --> 3333.05
the evidence right here and you're just

3330.83 --> 3335.48
spamming like you're not even listening

3333.05 --> 3337.119
so whether you're but or just an

3335.48 --> 3340.91
annoying troll that's not listening

3337.119 --> 3345.02
maybe your Shawn that would make sense

3340.91 --> 3347.14
not listening part but yeah get out of

3345.02 --> 3347.14
here

3348.67 --> 3356.42
yeah very good Voynich I was looking at

3353.99 --> 3360.1699999999996
it and he was on the edge but it's just

3356.42 --> 3361.099
this but thanks for holding back I

3360.17 --> 3371.48
appreciate that

3361.099 --> 3376.76
oh oh I get it

3371.48 --> 3378.15
it's Lottie well that makes it out

3376.76 --> 3382.96
different then

3378.15 --> 3382.96
[Music]

3390.02 --> 3396.47
hmm yeah a lotta you still obsessed with

3393.38 --> 3401.6
me must be crying at night calling out

3396.47 --> 3403.5499999999997
my name why won't he unblock me because

3401.6 --> 3406.22
you're acting like a [ __ ] and a stalker

3403.55 --> 3408.23
and until you're learning how to act

3406.22 --> 3412.0699999999997
like a normal person and let things go

3408.23 --> 3415.01
and clearly don't care anymore then

3412.07 --> 3417.0800000000004
maybe one day I might unlock you or

3415.01 --> 3418.5800000000004
simply forget about you and you'll

3417.08 --> 3422.96
forget about me that might be even

3418.58 --> 3426.38
better but as you continue behaving like

3422.96 --> 3429.92
this yeah I will absolutely mercilessly

3426.38 --> 3432.5
ban you and squish you and continue

3429.92 --> 3442.94
doing so until you will stop acting like

3432.5 --> 3451.91
a [ __ ] so yeah I'm gonna round out the

3442.94 --> 3453.86
show it's past 3:00 I don't know what

3451.91 --> 3456.35
could be more talking about ballers or

3453.86 --> 3459.02
stuff that I did go into some flat earth

3456.35 --> 3461.75
material if we look you know how that is

3459.02 --> 3465.59
somebody would be here with me on the

3461.75 --> 3467.48
panel then they could actually respond

3465.59 --> 3470.2400000000002
to what I say and we could elaborate on

3467.48 --> 3474.17
it but now that I'm talking I just put

3470.24 --> 3476.1189999999997
an idea out there and once I've done

3474.17 --> 3478.52
that and if I have lost track then

3476.119 --> 3482.6000000000004
eventually tend to move on really

3478.52 --> 3484.52
quickly and I know it's worth talking

3482.6 --> 3486.5899999999997
more elaborately about these complex

3484.52 --> 3489.2599999999998
things but it's very difficult to

3486.59 --> 3493.31
maintain that constantly every time just

3489.26 --> 3498.6800000000003
on my own talking with only the silent

3493.31 --> 3500.45
chat next to me just saying but anyway I

3498.68 --> 3503.1189999999997
am gonna run out to show it's been over

3500.45 --> 3504.77
an hour and it's been fine no it's not

3503.119 --> 3508.15
been over now it's just been an hour

3504.77 --> 3508.15
Oh anyway

3515.69 --> 3518.69
right

3519.63 --> 3526.67
okay so it's another troll it's it's

3522.27 --> 3526.67
just an annoying person right

3529.539 --> 3536.159
okay well there's bound to be more of

3532.179 --> 3536.159
those who knows who it is

3542.09 --> 3549.2000000000003
you know maybe it's the other guy that I

3546.26 --> 3552.98
met when I talked to him he really had a

3549.2 --> 3554.66
weird grin like he was hiding stuff and

3552.98 --> 3556.55
I know exactly how that works because I

3554.66 --> 3560.0499999999997
used to be like that but it all depends

3556.55 --> 3562.4900000000002
if he's gonna allow that to manifest

3560.05 --> 3565.3100000000004
because then he could become a secret

3562.49 --> 3567.6499999999996
troll I don't know if there's any

3565.31 --> 3572.45
validity to it but I see the option

3567.65 --> 3574.85
there I saw it I am aware of it so don't

3572.45 --> 3577.79
think you can fool me like that's really

3574.85 --> 3579.86
tough now when I'm like this when I'm

3577.79 --> 3585.74
vulnerable it's different but I am

3579.86 --> 3587.57
freaking confident and strong and now if

3585.74 --> 3591.31
you just turn out to be a troll then I

3587.57 --> 3591.31
will unwrap you

3597.91 --> 3606.0099999999998
right anyway yeah it's it was

3602.83 --> 3611.23
interesting to reflect back on yesterday

3606.01 --> 3615.1000000000004
I am not entirely sure if I am

3611.23 --> 3617.44
eventually gonna upload it the thing the

3615.1 --> 3620.2
this may be just the first part before

3617.44 --> 3622.18
Sean started before we started shouting

3620.2 --> 3627.75
at each other it was a good conversation

3622.18 --> 3631.75
I'm gonna have to listen back anyway but

3627.75 --> 3633.52
yeah for now I'm gonna run that show I

3631.75 --> 3639.16
will be back tomorrow with letters

3633.52 --> 3641.23
early-bird number 196 if you like the

3639.16 --> 3647.3199999999997
show please don't forget to upload it

3641.23 --> 3650.38
and also if you can please support the

3647.32 --> 3652.06
show through all the super chat and

3650.38 --> 3653.83
PayPal and everything that's in the

3652.06 --> 3658.06
description box below that's really

3653.83 --> 3660.9
helpful if you do that and yeah there's

3658.06 --> 3665.17
no flat earth debates today there may be

3660.9 --> 3667.57
another open panel on Jose's little

3665.17 --> 3672.09
later I'm gonna look if there's

3667.57 --> 3675.54
something going on there and yeah until

3672.09 --> 3679.8
the next Flat Earth early birth tomorrow

3675.54 --> 3679.8
keep it flat

3681.52 --> 3712.799
