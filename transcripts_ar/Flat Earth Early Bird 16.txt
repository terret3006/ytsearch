2.199 --> 8.599
good morning everyone

4.45 --> 10.249
this is Flat Earth early-bird number 16

8.599 --> 14.289000000000001
I'm your host

10.249 --> 18.98
Arwen and starting out with no yesterday

14.289 --> 29.779
but yeah there's a lot to talk about

18.98 --> 34.509
haha Jose Jose has a lot of really

29.779 --> 34.509
really good imagery and he already

34.539 --> 43.07
posted in the video yesterday and he's

38.39 --> 45.14
yes like dropping pit amazing pictures

43.07 --> 49.28
all over the place oh he's done some

45.14 --> 52.28
incredible horrid

49.28 --> 56.14
yeah horizontal tog Rafi on land land

52.28 --> 59.329
based horse on photography and yeah I'm

56.14 --> 63.199
I basically asked permission if I could

59.329 --> 73.189
present some of these just the pictures

63.199 --> 83.39
so I am just the ones he posted in Skype

73.189 --> 88.52
look at that it's not amazing so all on

83.39 --> 93.68
land look at all these bending going all

88.52 --> 97.0
over the place and even here you can

93.68 --> 100.399
just see it right there in the middle

97.0 --> 109.24
just cut off and then suddenly appears

100.399 --> 112.479
back amazing isn't it I'm hearing it's

109.24 --> 117.11
no idea what's going on here but that

112.479 --> 124.719
doesn't look that doesn't look very

117.11 --> 124.719
straight in the middle there yeah

127.39 --> 140.17
awesome oh these anyway yeah pretty good

137.71 --> 145.38
stuff see

140.17 --> 153.6
oh wait that's actually Travis's work

145.38 --> 156.51999999999998
see yeah these are Jose's sorry for that

153.6 --> 160.6
although Travis's ones were also very

156.52 --> 165.28
cool yeah the this one's just amazing so

160.6 --> 168.25
close to the tracks and just disappears

165.28 --> 171.0
really quickly like unless you're going

168.25 --> 171.0
up on a roller coaster

179.21 --> 188.78
missing stuff anyway

183.26 --> 190.39999999999998
look at that just amazing amazing stuff

188.78 --> 192.99
Wow

190.4 --> 196.08
yeah I have theories about these i

192.99 --> 200.85000000000002
express some of them that this has to do

196.08 --> 203.34
a lot with actual local refraction by

200.85 --> 205.5
refraction at some points relatively

203.34 --> 208.08
close by are is pretty strong and

205.5 --> 214.76
combined with this diffraction limit

208.08 --> 218.58
already being present it aggravates it

214.76 --> 222.57
so at some points the optical slant may

218.58 --> 227.79000000000002
actually still starts closer by and in

222.57 --> 231.29999999999998
other points or more vividly because of

227.79 --> 234.0
local refraction based effects the

231.3 --> 238.20000000000002
optical slant will always be there but

234.0 --> 240.54
yeah because of heat in this case local

238.2 --> 243.29
refraction is taking place causing

240.54 --> 246.75
another element to what is see

243.29 --> 250.47
distortion of refraction what it tends

246.75 --> 253.38
to do is it without a clear medium

250.47 --> 255.21
transition like a barrier or suddenly

253.38 --> 260.65999999999997
the material is different like glass

255.21 --> 265.31
versus water or air then it actually

260.66 --> 267.75
disperses light instead of bending it so

265.31 --> 273.3
yeah combine that with the diffraction

267.75 --> 275.46
effect and you can at least it's not too

273.3 --> 278.85
difficult to imagine what's going on

275.46 --> 282.63
there so to model it out however is

278.85 --> 285.3
another matter of course but yeah I

282.63 --> 288.6
think this is explainable using their

285.3 --> 291.15000000000003
fraction and other effects lying but it

288.6 --> 295.68
is an amazing sight nonetheless very

291.15 --> 298.52
surreal so thank you Jose for doing that

295.68 --> 301.64
and thanks Travis

298.52 --> 301.64
awesome stuff

305.22 --> 312.15900000000005
see wasn't chat

308.31 --> 317.289
Daniel field they've read I'll be hello

312.159 --> 319.84
flat ball Nicholas Nathan Oakley it's

317.289 --> 324.699
good to see you and yeah do subscribe to

319.84 --> 327.81899999999996
Nathan Oakley channel thanks for sharing

324.699 --> 329.979
it on Facebook sharing Walter a few

327.819 --> 335.03900000000004
diplomat yeah thanks guys for coming

329.979 --> 337.599
ah Adam hey good to see you

335.039 --> 342.509
yeah if any of you want to join you know

337.599 --> 342.509
what to do I have the panel open

345.97 --> 349.059
[Music]

361.64 --> 364.69
[Music]

370.62 --> 377.85
so yep

375.26 --> 383.15999999999997
everybody's working we're having

377.85 --> 390.02000000000004
breakfast and I have to keep him talking

383.16 --> 390.02000000000004
so yeah it was Black Friday it is like

390.26 --> 399.2
to do a little shopping yeah

393.39 --> 412.86
unexpected discounts so I got some these

399.2 --> 418.26
very useful and sturdy one all together

412.86 --> 420.84000000000003
it was cheap not insanely cheap still

418.26 --> 429.24
for my doing a very worthwhile

420.84 --> 432.03
investment for this time now so like

429.24 --> 435.93
Friday everything is cheap everything

432.03 --> 440.48999999999995
has to go hey Ellen hold it Owen are you

435.93 --> 444.83
yeah doing good you look sir but I need

440.49 --> 444.83
a cup of tea right yeah me too

449.3 --> 457.68
how's the cold out there um it's pretty

452.67 --> 461.37
great bit warmer today than it has been

457.68 --> 462.84000000000003
for the wasn't it yeah let's not talk

461.37 --> 465.45
about the weather like two boring

462.84 --> 467.64
Englishmen though why not let's talk

465.45 --> 471.45
about term what do you think the future

467.64 --> 474.53999999999996
of Flat Earth is let's say twenty years

471.45 --> 477.45
from now what do you think that will

474.54 --> 480.66
look like I think it will be back where

477.45 --> 487.28999999999996
it originally was as a part of folklore

480.66 --> 489.24
a certain group of people will be we'll

487.29 --> 492.36
have that as knowledge we'll have that

489.24 --> 496.11
for themselves and yeah there may be

492.36 --> 498.03000000000003
activist groups eventually and who knows

496.11 --> 501.0
where that will go maybe they will grow

498.03 --> 504.94899999999996
out of control all depends on what

501.0 --> 506.84
happens how everybody is influenced but

504.949 --> 508.75
this is not going away a lot of people

506.84 --> 512.289
have seen this have taken it to heart

508.75 --> 516.02
will ponder it over their lifetimes and

512.289 --> 518.9
it will end back at where it was in

516.02 --> 528.26
folklore before it was very aggressively

518.9 --> 531.56
removed so what's that what do you think

528.26 --> 534.41
the end goal of Effie should be is old

531.56 --> 537.17
there's all little different kinds of

534.41 --> 542.3
fractions different kind of strains so

537.17 --> 546.3499999999999
to say so if the Flat Earth knowledge is

542.3 --> 548.0
general knowledge and becomes true what

546.35 --> 549.86
do you think I'm up in there with all

548.0 --> 551.93
the little groups who believe different

549.86 --> 556.61
things well that's only the beginning of

551.93 --> 561.29
it what do you think they're hiding what

556.61 --> 565.4300000000001
why knowledge knowledge yeah true not

561.29 --> 567.29
knowing things allows you to control

565.43 --> 570.2299999999999
other features if they don't have that

567.29 --> 572.5
knowledge so unique and only you can

570.23 --> 575.48
perceive because you have the knowledge

572.5 --> 581.62
so you don't think it's just land or God

575.48 --> 586.52
or what's probably land yeah but also

581.62 --> 588.89
possibilities but certain technological

586.52 --> 592.76
possibilities that will natural come to

588.89 --> 595.13
rise will be so influential this is even

592.76 --> 597.67
generally known some things are so

595.13 --> 602.36
influential like for example be known

597.67 --> 607.61
thing with Tesla that yeah they don't

602.36 --> 610.9590000000001
want that that it's too too liberating

607.61 --> 614.38
it it narrows down the possibilities to

610.959 --> 617.779
parasites on the public basically and

614.38 --> 619.82
yeah there are technologies possible

617.779 --> 623.24
eventually they're so incredible so

619.82 --> 626.63
efficient that we just don't need them

623.24 --> 629.089
anymore in a pragmatic sense so you

626.63 --> 635.62
think it's a control method of course it

629.089 --> 635.62
is hmm

636.16 --> 641.4499999999999
what do you think what do you think it's

638.78 --> 643.39
gonna happen if we do go back to the

641.45 --> 646.9300000000001
moon does that interest you

643.39 --> 649.88
well they might perform another stunt

646.93 --> 651.5
indeed all depends on what they wanted

649.88 --> 655.75
where they want to go with it it could

651.5 --> 658.64
be just media driven and on the surface

655.75 --> 663.32
or it could take it extremely serious

658.64 --> 667.91
and like push a giant cultural peer

663.32 --> 670.0400000000001
pressure based wave from that - yeah to

667.91 --> 673.1
aggressively fight back at Flat Earth

670.04 --> 674.8399999999999
for example I would be expecting that

673.1 --> 680.02
although it's not necessarily that

674.84 --> 682.61
they're gonna do it because they

680.02 --> 686.06
understand that with the Internet age

682.61 --> 690.11
comes the inevitable figuring out of

686.06 --> 693.9499999999999
these things and they you can't row it

690.11 --> 697.22
out it was like every time they do it

693.95 --> 700.0600000000001
and people just reawaken hmm well you've

697.22 --> 706.22
always said that the the moon is a

700.06 --> 709.25
holographic light love anew yes doesn't

706.22 --> 711.8000000000001
mean that Cain can't fake it again much

709.25 --> 713.93
better by the way they're much better

711.8 --> 715.91
technology available to do it if they

713.93 --> 719.0899999999999
want to do it risk it

715.91 --> 722.0
so if it's a light what is it being

719.09 --> 730.2800000000001
projected onto something or is it a

722.0 --> 733.94
hologram it is like a hologram it is in

730.28 --> 737.51
relation to the observer observable and

733.94 --> 739.4300000000001
in apparent position you think that's

737.51 --> 744.14
why it's upside down when people from

739.43 --> 746.0899999999999
Australia see it upside down what's

744.14 --> 747.97
supposed to be upside down so if I was

746.09 --> 751.4300000000001
to take a picture of the moon

747.97 --> 753.65
the craters would be one way where it's

751.43 --> 756.17
something like was to picture from

753.65 --> 759.38
Australia all right right right well the

756.17 --> 763.8499999999999
moon does turn around its axis very

759.38 --> 766.58
slowly so yeah but what's its axis if

763.85 --> 768.97
it's if there's a projection animal like

766.58 --> 768.97
rocks

770.12 --> 778.319
onto the ball art yes spins just routine

775.29 --> 780.629
you may change over time so and since

778.319 --> 783.809
the time and the location are linearly

780.629 --> 786.66
related yeah if you're gonna move to

783.809 --> 789.0889999999999
another location then yeah it will

786.66 --> 791.91
probably turn like even if you observe

789.089 --> 793.649
it all the way like during night I mean

791.91 --> 796.069
you just keep your camera on the moon

793.649 --> 800.37
and you travel through plane I guess

796.069 --> 805.4989999999999
straight to the south like with the

800.37 --> 808.259
night so maybe slightly westwards as you

805.499 --> 812.6990000000001
go south so say from Europe to South

808.259 --> 814.559
America I guess sort of like that and

812.699 --> 816.5999999999999
yeah so you're thinking that the light

814.559 --> 819.689
source depending on where you viewing it

816.6 --> 822.72
from rotates slowly through throughout

819.689 --> 828.149
the night or yes it does it really does

822.72 --> 830.4590000000001
the moon slowly rotates clockwise hmm

828.149 --> 841.5
invisibly during the day you can measure

830.459 --> 844.4699999999999
it and so does the Sun by way what do

841.5 --> 848.43
you what do you think the source of the

844.47 --> 851.85
hologram is tellin ya that's a big

848.43 --> 857.189
mystical question isn't it there's all

851.85 --> 860.309
kinds of angles to approach it my most

857.189 --> 869.0889999999999
recent approach is that it is sound

860.309 --> 871.709
based potentially sound based yes well

869.089 --> 875.3090000000001
what does that experiment again with the

871.709 --> 878.04
water in the glass and you unleash

875.309 --> 880.949
certain sound frequency on it I think

878.04 --> 884.2199999999999
and then a miniature light effect will

880.949 --> 887.819
start like beer right wasn't that sound

884.22 --> 890.639
bass yes yes so seem like well look it's

887.819 --> 893.2489999999999
already right proof that in there that

890.639 --> 896.009
it is possible to create like the sound

893.249 --> 900.5600000000001
as basic as that very complex specific

896.009 --> 904.04
set up its resonance based so

900.56 --> 907.52
if the earth was a rectangular Newton

904.04 --> 910.16
confined like a box whatever shape

907.52 --> 913.85
rhythmic shaped could work like a guitar

910.16 --> 917.18
case and at the wider points which

913.85 --> 919.6700000000001
happen to be the equator well the sound

917.18 --> 921.7099999999999
would have its biggest strength

919.67 --> 923.51
naturally if it's present whatever

921.71 --> 926.1800000000001
frequency it's gonna be it's gonna be

923.51 --> 930.13
adapted to the shape it's gonna appear

926.18 --> 933.38
and create potentially light elements

930.13 --> 936.2
influence maybe by magnetics to rotate

933.38 --> 939.68
or I mean I'm just mildly speculating

936.2 --> 943.1600000000001
now but yeah maybe the heavenly globe of

939.68 --> 946.4899999999999
the heavens is sound based do you think

943.16 --> 948.74
we all operate a frequency no do you

946.49 --> 952.029
think we all operate at a frequency all

948.74 --> 956.42
all objects we all resonate rate well

952.029 --> 959.57
operate at every creature has its

956.42 --> 961.8499999999999
frequency and every cell has its

959.57 --> 963.2
frequency every organ has its frequency

961.85 --> 966.23
everything has a frequency it's

963.2 --> 971.0600000000001
basically all about the size and the

966.23 --> 974.21
density yeah my little tensed and the

971.06 --> 978.88
shape and all this matters all this can

974.21 --> 981.02
be extrapolated into a frequency

978.88 --> 983.81
fascinating it's all been mapped out

981.02 --> 987.25
like it's been done for these 20 years

983.81 --> 990.4399999999999
my dad has like a machine that uses this

987.25 --> 993.56
system to analyze your body with basic

990.44 --> 996.83
sound pulses and just freakin map out

993.56 --> 1000.16
everything that is in your body up to

996.83 --> 1002.7700000000001
astounding detail like like no way you

1000.16 --> 1005.1
believe you can't believe that that can

1002.77 --> 1009.31
be done but yeah I can and it's really

1005.1 --> 1013.45
accurate through sites oversight over

1009.31 --> 1017.1899999999999
the body and the ecology of it I was

1013.45 --> 1019.51
looking at kirlyam photographs yesterday

1017.19 --> 1024.4
you know the different auras around

1019.51 --> 1026.29
people have you seen that sorry kirlyam

1024.4 --> 1028.8700000000001
photography have you seen that before

1026.29 --> 1029.26
where people of different colored auras

1028.87 --> 1031.03
around

1029.26 --> 1034.03
oh yeah the are after yeah I've seen it

1031.03 --> 1036.459
I always wanted to try it out

1034.03 --> 1040.05
yeah I wouldn't mind trying that just

1036.459 --> 1043.03
just know about believe in anything that

1040.05 --> 1045.459
looks like if I done in the time that I

1043.03 --> 1049.3899999999999
was confronted with it with me like ten

1045.459 --> 1051.04
years ago I would have probably seen all

1049.39 --> 1052.24
kinds of things that I wouldn't want to

1051.04 --> 1055.48
see me because I was plagued by

1052.24 --> 1059.86
nightmares and [ __ ] just because good

1055.48 --> 1062.5
vision experiences but now I feel much

1059.86 --> 1065.86
stronger much more purposeful much more

1062.5 --> 1067.11
straightforward and I'm just very

1065.86 --> 1070.75
curious like yeah

1067.11 --> 1072.1599999999999
does it chill I don't understand how it

1070.75 --> 1074.61
works I was just looking at it last

1072.16 --> 1077.41
night I thought that looks a reflection

1074.61 --> 1080.86
it just measures energy very subtle

1077.41 --> 1086.1100000000001
energies and body has that every living

1080.86 --> 1088.24
thing has energy that it radiates the

1086.11 --> 1089.9199999999998
Penn zone depending on its youth and its

1088.24 --> 1092.53
strength and this is measurable it's

1089.92 --> 1096.49
like and that you can even measure this

1092.53 --> 1103.18
in for example food and fruits they

1096.49 --> 1104.83
radiate energy you can measure all kind

1103.18 --> 1106.42
of like life energy you can measure it

1104.83 --> 1109.77
looks you measure it almost like

1106.42 --> 1112.63
electricity it looks very bizarre very

1109.77 --> 1114.43
magicky but it is just yeah you can

1112.63 --> 1118.6000000000001
measure that or you could make that our

1114.43 --> 1120.88
thing is with more complex beings like

1118.6 --> 1124.3899999999999
more mammal based beings and smart

1120.88 --> 1125.6200000000001
creatures and humans primarily because

1124.39 --> 1128.7700000000002
they have the most interesting

1125.62 --> 1132.6999999999998
intellects and in the workings and yeah

1128.77 --> 1136.33
our us it is a side effect I guess of

1132.7 --> 1140.49
consciousness and if you have issues

1136.33 --> 1146.53
yeah you it will reflect on your arm

1140.49 --> 1149.71
interesting it is so

1146.53 --> 1153.0
when you get like actual intuitive

1149.71 --> 1157.3600000000001
senses for it do you think that's from

1153.0 --> 1160.03
hunter-gatherer past it is part of the

1157.36 --> 1166.99
hunting mechanism indeed animals have a

1160.03 --> 1170.35
- they size up targets see but yeah

1166.99 --> 1171.82
that's very there are so many different

1170.35 --> 1174.25
types of creatures out there and some

1171.82 --> 1176.53
look alike but are very different but

1174.25 --> 1180.01
some are aggressive some are not and

1176.53 --> 1185.2
it's just they can just read the subtle

1180.01 --> 1189.16
movements and get a feeling of what what

1185.2 --> 1191.8300000000002
it is and if it is noticing like real

1189.16 --> 1196.42
hunters cat feline especially they can

1191.83 --> 1197.52
sense if a creature senses them it's

1196.42 --> 1203.5
fascinating

1197.52 --> 1205.81
yeah I watched my cats and do you think

1203.5 --> 1209.02
to some extent we've kind of lost all

1205.81 --> 1212.86
our ability but sometimes from some some

1209.02 --> 1214.66
of it leaks back through no I don't

1212.86 --> 1216.76
think anybody has lost their ability I

1214.66 --> 1221.14
just think they don't realize they have

1216.76 --> 1226.27
it it's something you got to recognize

1221.14 --> 1229.0300000000002
you got to touch upon and then have the

1226.27 --> 1232.66
room inside of your soul and inside of

1229.03 --> 1234.55
your being to deal with it and to give

1232.66 --> 1238.72
it a like a more permanent long-term

1234.55 --> 1243.01
place and potentially apply it throw

1238.72 --> 1245.5
skill in it if you allow yourself but

1243.01 --> 1248.47
yeah that's usually the biggest obstacle

1245.5 --> 1251.14
like serial things a lot of people have

1248.47 --> 1254.92
allergies against this thanks again to

1251.14 --> 1257.0200000000002
this freakin scientist and cult that

1254.92 --> 1263.1100000000001
highly discourages and it ridicules

1257.02 --> 1267.22
anything ethereal so but yeah I broke

1263.11 --> 1269.11
through that a long time ago yeah it's

1267.22 --> 1270.97
kind of interesting I was I was talking

1269.11 --> 1274.24
to mr. Grimm last night about the

1270.97 --> 1277.09
possibility of consciousness existing

1274.24 --> 1281.19
outside of the brain quite an

1277.09 --> 1281.1899999999998
interesting electric world

1281.7 --> 1289.0900000000001
all right which is wrong to go onto

1285.81 --> 1295.75
Karelian photography in and that kind of

1289.09 --> 1302.35
stuff the more mystical side of things I

1295.75 --> 1305.68
guess right Wow

1302.35 --> 1307.84
I'm looking at jadon your stuffs

1305.68 --> 1318.76
happening there near them is very active

1307.84 --> 1321.85
yeah that's pretty weird okay Eric yeah

1318.76 --> 1326.59
what off what crack exactly are we

1321.85 --> 1329.3999999999999
talking about Nathan so unlike you don't

1326.59 --> 1333.8799999999999
know that's what we had come in darling

1329.4 --> 1339.97
yeah you are Ferb butter off the

1333.88 --> 1344.16
crackling look I don't use that I've

1339.97 --> 1348.31
never used that I tried it once like I

1344.16 --> 1351.7
don't know very long ago like like once

1348.31 --> 1354.76
and it sucked I didn't like it I'm glad

1351.7 --> 1357.22
I didn't take a lot of it it was just

1354.76 --> 1360.12
pushy make me feel pushy but not

1357.22 --> 1362.74
enthusiastic it sucks

1360.12 --> 1366.1499999999999
or suddenly that [ __ ] I have enough

1362.74 --> 1373.29
energy of my own don't deny your habit

1366.15 --> 1373.2900000000002
what does that mean Nathan

1374.179 --> 1384.1290000000001
yeah once for seven years what is this

1378.039 --> 1386.45
is that the real Nathan it should be

1384.129 --> 1394.85
what are you doing Nathan do you think

1386.45 --> 1395.779
this is funny or something you sure it's

1394.85 --> 1401.049
the real one Owen

1395.779 --> 1403.879
well he has a wrench let's check him out

1401.049 --> 1407.32
so we're playing yeah it is the real one

1403.879 --> 1407.32
I don't know what what he's doing

1407.649 --> 1419.299
Nathan what's going on right well maybe

1417.769 --> 1429.73
Nikolas in a Fae mood today

1419.299 --> 1429.73
weird but only is with himself

1435.1 --> 1442.4289999999999
yeah I do stick to their I haven't

1439.24 --> 1445.879
touched any kind of chemical [ __ ] in a

1442.429 --> 1448.97
long long time it's very happy to well

1445.879 --> 1452.899
well even if you have and I don't hunker

1448.97 --> 1455.69
no I'm just really glad that I don't

1452.899 --> 1457.82
allow myself to subject myself to

1455.69 --> 1459.74
something that crappy because it really

1457.82 --> 1462.4399999999998
is crappy the only place it was ever

1459.74 --> 1468.23
good was in my mind because I trusted it

1462.44 --> 1470.509
that's it oh and surely even if you have

1468.23 --> 1474.669
an even if you do it's nobody else was

1470.509 --> 1476.929
business I haven't I swear it on my life

1474.669 --> 1479.269
we don't have to prove anything to me

1476.929 --> 1481.94
I don't care I'm just publicly stating

1479.269 --> 1487.49
that I haven't I don't do anything

1481.94 --> 1491.8400000000001
except cannabis and tobacco and non drug

1487.49 --> 1495.139
supplements that are all-natural base so

1491.84 --> 1498.97
what do you think about the strains of

1495.139 --> 1503.1789999999999
cannabis getting stronger and stronger I

1498.97 --> 1506.869
find it a little worrisome but that it

1503.179 --> 1508.8700000000001
all depends on management and I don't

1506.869 --> 1511.8799999999999
know

1508.87 --> 1513.62
so it mostly means in a free market is

1511.88 --> 1515.63
that eventually you'll just have to be

1513.62 --> 1518.2399999999998
very careful as to what you're gonna

1515.63 --> 1520.0100000000002
grab especially when you start out as if

1518.24 --> 1524.29
you start out with something it's really

1520.01 --> 1528.35
heavy yet you can just get hurt I was I

1524.29 --> 1531.1399999999999
was watching a program and about it

1528.35 --> 1533.3
being legalized in America and some of

1531.14 --> 1536.75
the strains and things products that

1533.3 --> 1540.31
they were creating but a THC value of 80

1536.75 --> 1549.46
percent on that quite worrying

1540.31 --> 1552.5
that's quite strong right I only get

1549.46 --> 1555.68
irregular strains here from coffee shops

1552.5 --> 1559.9
and they are okay they're decent what

1555.68 --> 1559.9
are they about four to ten percent

1573.04 --> 1586.52
between 14 and 60 and a half some point

1577.54 --> 1589.28
hey Eric Aloha so Eric hey freezing my

1586.52 --> 1592.49
buttocks off here that's what you get

1589.28 --> 1597.86
for my seat oh I'm even further north

1592.49 --> 1600.08
than that central New York you had the

1597.86 --> 1605.33
base of the Adirondacks if you know that

1600.08 --> 1607.9099999999999
mountain range let's say you have you

1605.33 --> 1610.55
any idea what's going on in chat here

1607.91 --> 1617.0900000000001
yeah I don't know is that really Nathan

1610.55 --> 1619.04
or yeah is he on drugs I don't know it's

1617.09 --> 1621.4299999999998
probably been snorting PG tipps or

1619.04 --> 1621.43
something

1623.15 --> 1629.93
I'm not sure this is Nathan yeah it is

1626.26 --> 1635.9
absolutely it is everyone it seems to be

1629.93 --> 1637.49
in it it's a silly move here I mean - it

1635.9 --> 1640.13
might be it might be a planetary

1637.49 --> 1642.41
alignment going on oh by the way there

1640.13 --> 1645.68
was a freaking full moon yesterday yeah

1642.41 --> 1647.3300000000002
it was huge here it was like I was

1645.68 --> 1648.14
smoking outside it was like almost

1647.33 --> 1651.02
painful

1648.14 --> 1655.0900000000001
I got think it's like a giant

1651.02 --> 1660.49
refrigerator lights yeah it's definitely

1655.09 --> 1665.02
kernel crikey it's minus 7 here scioscia

1660.49 --> 1667.97
Celsius minus 7

1665.02 --> 1671.44
what is it back home in Shanghai Oh 13

1667.97 --> 1678.53
in Shanghai right now at night not bad

1671.44 --> 1683.3300000000002
Fahrenheit no Celsius all right yeah

1678.53 --> 1686.26
still in the still around 20 degrees the

1683.33 --> 1689.8
day in Shanghai that's okay

1686.26 --> 1693.65
well they are a middle of a big city so

1689.8 --> 1697.33
yeah trouble throwing cat2 in the air

1693.65 --> 1699.6100000000001
there so that also helps they engage in

1697.33 --> 1701.4499999999998
spraying something there's always

1699.61 --> 1703.4599999999998
somebody trying to tell me they don't

1701.45 --> 1707.27
spray in China I beg to differ about its

1703.46 --> 1709.64
trade tends to only cool off they don't

1707.27 --> 1710.87
want that I think it's due and I think

1709.64 --> 1712.73
it's weather thing I don't know if

1710.87 --> 1715.04
they're doing any sort of I don't know

1712.73 --> 1718.6100000000001
what it is no a storm engineering

1715.04 --> 1723.02
definitely here's a here's a good topic

1718.61 --> 1724.79
a lot of people always you know Eric you

1723.02 --> 1726.44
said you caught me you're such a I'm an

1724.79 --> 1732.83
orca seen if you live in China well

1726.44 --> 1735.89
that's a yeah that comment is just so I

1732.83 --> 1737.8999999999999
was arguing with somebody about I think

1735.89 --> 1739.7
they're a bit of a left-wing Marxist and

1737.9 --> 1741.47
there's I was really like why don't you

1739.7 --> 1743.54
ever sit you know he likes to rag on us

1741.47 --> 1750.26
stupid Americans and our Thanksgiving

1743.54 --> 1751.6399999999999
and blah blah blah what's that well no I

1750.26 --> 1754.87
mean it's like you know a lot of people

1751.64 --> 1756.5
don't know how to separate a country's

1754.87 --> 1759.4099999999999
policy

1756.5 --> 1762.2
agree with what the US does and very

1759.41 --> 1767.18
much whatsoever but there is a

1762.2 --> 1769.07
difference between USA and and America

1767.18 --> 1773.53
the country of the people the culture I

1769.07 --> 1777.6799999999998
mean yeah it's intertwined but you know

1773.53 --> 1779.84
but anyway I was trying to tell him that

1777.68 --> 1783.05
actually in Thailand which is supposedly

1779.84 --> 1785.12
a democracy if you criticize the the

1783.05 --> 1788.18
royal family there you more likely to

1785.12 --> 1791.03
get punishment than criticizing the

1788.18 --> 1795.53
Chinese government that's a interesting

1791.03 --> 1797.8999999999999
reality so I don't China is it's pretty

1795.53 --> 1803.42
free in China in some ways Internet's

1797.9 --> 1806.21
not free but well it is like let leave

1803.42 --> 1809.0600000000002
the pressure off they could put it up a

1806.21 --> 1811.64
great deal but they don't need to so

1809.06 --> 1815.24
they basically only leave that kind of

1811.64 --> 1821.21
heavy action to things that are like

1815.24 --> 1827.65
really politically take you down really

1821.21 --> 1830.9
quickly but otherwise no in fact radio

1827.65 --> 1833.3600000000001
shows and talk about well you know how

1830.9 --> 1835.49
corrupt the Beijing government is you

1833.36 --> 1837.08
know how crappy Mao Zedong was and

1835.49 --> 1840.11
that's pretty cool I think there's one

1837.08 --> 1844.37
thing if you start Taiwan is a sensitive

1840.11 --> 1846.02
subject Oh Chinese government worries

1844.37 --> 1848.3
about one thing if you're starting to

1846.02 --> 1850.76
organize you know that's their cup like

1848.3 --> 1855.32
if I was having meetings of say ten or

1850.76 --> 1859.37
more time here that Apple actually like

1855.32 --> 1868.1599999999999
the Apple iPhone banned the Taiwanese

1859.37 --> 1869.87
flag you know these companies these mugs

1868.16 --> 1874.7
they want to access to the Chinese

1869.87 --> 1877.28
market bow down no they want to write

1874.7 --> 1879.55
prophetic that governments are so

1877.28 --> 1882.59
obsessed about a little emoticon a

1879.55 --> 1886.3999999999999
cartoon it's us sick people are in

1882.59 --> 1889.25
government a EU Beijing Washington yeah

1886.4 --> 1890.15
but even in a sense they are right

1889.25 --> 1894.11
because II

1890.15 --> 1896.75
in the slightest icon can become a total

1894.11 --> 1899.3
trolling tool so they just take

1896.75 --> 1902.9
everything they know what they're doing

1899.3 --> 1905.87
but it is wrong in my opinion it's not

1902.9 --> 1907.64
necessary and it's just one approach one

1905.87 --> 1910.9399999999998
angle if you just let it free

1907.64 --> 1913.25
yeah then anything can happen well I

1910.94 --> 1915.1100000000001
talked to my what matter as much because

1913.25 --> 1919.16
everyone is allowed to say whatever they

1915.11 --> 1919.6399999999999
like as long as they don't act basically

1919.16 --> 1922.3400000000001
on it

1919.64 --> 1924.0200000000002
I don't argue with Chinese I don't

1922.34 --> 1925.85
actually don't use you know I don't

1924.02 --> 1927.74
really argue with many people unless

1925.85 --> 1930.35
they're just really acting saying don't

1927.74 --> 1932.3
[ __ ] then I just belittle it but like

1930.35 --> 1935.0
when I talk to Chinese about the whole

1932.3 --> 1937.84
like the South China Sea and even

1935.0 --> 1942.65
Taiwan's a good example and is that

1937.84 --> 1944.84
their thinking is well historically it

1942.65 --> 1946.5500000000002
was part of China and we have maps I'm

1944.84 --> 1947.9599999999998
like then I show him old maps of how

1946.55 --> 1949.22
China was a different shape with

1947.96 --> 1950.81
different dynasties and I'm like what

1949.22 --> 1954.17
are you talking about and then in your

1950.81 --> 1956.24
logic I guess you you know Rome should

1954.17 --> 1958.94
start bombing the rest of Europe because

1956.24 --> 1962.72
well you know historically that used to

1958.94 --> 1965.48
be part of Rome and they're like okay

1962.72 --> 1971.09
yeah so I just suggest things and let

1965.48 --> 1972.92
them go their merry way it's pretty

1971.09 --> 1974.6599999999999
silly the whole South China I think they

1972.92 --> 1977.66
just left on it because it's called the

1974.66 --> 1985.25
South China Sea you know it's like oh it

1977.66 --> 1988.75
must be Chinese so what was your topic

1985.25 --> 1988.75
with Allen he's off making tea

1990.37 --> 1995.57
alternative things are you rolling

1994.91 --> 2010.47
something

1995.57 --> 2010.47
yeah I heard me talking about conscious

2011.46 --> 2016.0
we're talking about worth what proof

2014.68 --> 2018.0700000000002
would be in twenty years

2016.0 --> 2019.9
oh yeah yeah that's right what in 20

2018.07 --> 2022.83
years I'm sorry where Flat Earth would

2019.9 --> 2027.63
be in 20 years right

2022.83 --> 2029.4299999999998
well I don't know I'd like to see reason

2027.63 --> 2033.5100000000002
I'm in flat earth and other things is to

2029.43 --> 2035.79
see hopefully see if humanity can lean

2033.51 --> 2037.67
towards individuality a bit more instead

2035.79 --> 2041.31
of yeah

2037.67 --> 2047.25
collectivism I'll definitely help with

2041.31 --> 2049.35
that that's that's my uh you know when

2047.25 --> 2051.659
he/she why are you here you don't want

2049.35 --> 2053.64
to talk about the either R 2 T 2 X the Y

2051.659 --> 2059.37
at all are whatever he goes on about

2053.64 --> 2061.62
like Jesus nourished her he likes to he

2059.37 --> 2065.97
likes to go through the linguistics and

2061.62 --> 2068.3399999999997
play those games like you know how words

2065.97 --> 2070.6789999999996
are related unlike P you understand the

2068.34 --> 2072.57
brain is a pattern recognition machine

2070.679 --> 2075.4500000000003
we can do this to the cows cows come

2072.57 --> 2079.4700000000003
home and say it's all conspiracy well

2075.45 --> 2082.1
yeah language is a conspiracy well there

2079.47 --> 2084.6299999999997
is a conspiracy in language but of

2082.1 --> 2087.419
course are we talking about we talk him

2084.63 --> 2089.04
out PJ yeah yeah you know he goes on

2087.419 --> 2092.22
about he likes to land-based

2089.04 --> 2094.2
other people that talk about subjects if

2092.22 --> 2097.95
you know if you're not on board with his

2094.2 --> 2102.0899999999997
uh his subject matter then you must be

2097.95 --> 2105.18
an agent and you're an idiot and Wow to

2102.09 --> 2110.6400000000003
be honest he's basically acting like one

2105.18 --> 2113.64
of these hopefully they're the problem

2110.64 --> 2116.79
with Papes theory is it only works in

2113.64 --> 2120.42
English yeah that's what they tried to

2116.79 --> 2122.67
uh that's one thing I never got out of

2120.42 --> 2125.79
the hole the loominatee you know that

2122.67 --> 2129.15
really you're saying a bunch of a few

2125.79 --> 2131.33
Western families white families are

2129.15 --> 2133.05
gonna rule the world I say I think I

2131.33 --> 2135.18
think Asians

2133.05 --> 2136.8
which have a bit of power they might

2135.18 --> 2141.39
have something to say about that

2136.8 --> 2144.0
Chinese Jagan Arnaz a mother I think if

2141.39 --> 2146.8799999999997
anything William Gibson was closer to

2144.0 --> 2150.35
the truth when he said in his books the

2146.88 --> 2153.6
Neuromancer and captain's era count zero

2150.35 --> 2156.1
that the banks and large corporations

2153.6 --> 2159.92
would end up rolling

2156.1 --> 2162.23
um yeah that's pretty much half right

2159.92 --> 2165.17
now I mean do we have any socialist or

2162.23 --> 2167.27
communist or or democracies or republics

2165.17 --> 2170.09
do we have any of those things

2167.27 --> 2175.37
well they dictate the control mechanisms

2170.09 --> 2177.53
don't let the price valu yeah so I nice

2175.37 --> 2179.48
I see government as you know a lot of

2177.53 --> 2181.28
people especially leftist would want to

2179.48 --> 2183.68
say oh you know evil capitalist

2181.28 --> 2186.5600000000004
corporations I just see corporations as

2183.68 --> 2187.37
an extension of government not the other

2186.56 --> 2189.77
way around

2187.37 --> 2192.5299999999997
sorry I know a lot of a lot of people

2189.77 --> 2194.57
want to hate the rich people and there's

2192.53 --> 2198.71
a lot of valid you know make Monsanto

2194.57 --> 2202.7000000000003
it's not a cool company BP is not a cool

2198.71 --> 2205.28
company but these are just in my view

2202.7 --> 2209.87
they're just extensions just orders of

2205.28 --> 2212.0600000000004
government the state well they're in

2209.87 --> 2215.47
conjunction with it is kind of like a

2212.06 --> 2219.17
corporatist fascism color because

2215.47 --> 2223.97
governments let themselves be dragged

2219.17 --> 2227.12
around by a company plants that's how it

2223.97 --> 2229.2799999999997
works they right along with that and

2227.12 --> 2232.0
they choose and pick their companies

2229.28 --> 2235.7900000000004
basically and these companies have

2232.0 --> 2237.68
adversaries and agendas and yeah so it

2235.79 --> 2239.96
is kind of almost like the companies are

2237.68 --> 2244.2799999999997
war fairing with each other using

2239.96 --> 2248.93
countries that's basically when it comes

2244.28 --> 2252.4700000000003
down to on many different skills yeah

2248.93 --> 2255.71
are you suggesting that corporations are

2252.47 --> 2258.77
powerful there well obviously than some

2255.71 --> 2260.36
governments because of the money but

2258.77 --> 2262.7
would you say there's a corporation

2260.36 --> 2265.4900000000002
that's more powerful than the state of

2262.7 --> 2267.98
you know the US State or the UK or China

2265.49 --> 2271.9399999999996
or Japan all depends on what you

2267.98 --> 2275.75
consider as power because a country that

2271.94 --> 2279.4700000000003
is not super monolithic in nature is not

2275.75 --> 2282.7
gonna be as quick as a corporation

2279.47 --> 2287.6299999999997
that's just clear-cut agenda with the

2282.7 --> 2288.96
basically had picked by one per person

2287.63 --> 2291.15
with one goal the

2288.96 --> 2292.65
gonna function a lot quicker so it all

2291.15 --> 2294.0
depends on what you can say their power

2292.65 --> 2296.19
yeah I'm the long run

2294.0 --> 2298.05
America is hard to defeat because it's

2296.19 --> 2300.8
so huge and they have a good spirit

2298.05 --> 2302.9
against it but it's not quick

2300.8 --> 2307.29
government's not quick at all

2302.9 --> 2311.69
corporations are very quick but you're

2307.29 --> 2314.52
not ruled by legislation based their

2311.69 --> 2316.44
very nature need to be guided by

2314.52 --> 2318.75
bureaucracy it all depends on the

2316.44 --> 2322.589
country though but yet governments give

2318.75 --> 2325.32
exceptions to companies a lot of course

2322.589 --> 2327.69
so they basically took the easy bail

2325.32 --> 2329.04
they give that welfare they you know

2327.69 --> 2330.9500000000003
they I'm sorry they don't we don't call

2329.04 --> 2334.77
it welfare what do we call it a bailout

2330.95 --> 2338.49
subsidies bats but also just let certain

2334.77 --> 2340.92
companies break certain rules thick like

2338.49 --> 2348.4199999999996
McDonald's was exempt from the Obamacare

2340.92 --> 2352.26
thing for example yeah yes very out

2348.42 --> 2355.53
there and it the problem is is that the

2352.26 --> 2358.1400000000003
corporation's just have naturally have

2355.53 --> 2364.0800000000004
too much power and because their nature

2358.14 --> 2368.8799999999997
is to take more and to grow bigger then

2364.08 --> 2373.71
yeah they in the end will always end up

2368.88 --> 2375.869
on top or ten let me ask you something

2373.71 --> 2380.64
what's your idea do you think it's a

2375.869 --> 2382.619
necessary that a corporation or just

2380.64 --> 2386.43
let's call it an organization has to be

2382.619 --> 2390.089
a publicly traded IPO which I mean I

2386.43 --> 2392.0099999999998
think we got rid of that you know for

2390.089 --> 2394.2
example if you're an IPA if you're you

2392.01 --> 2396.5400000000004
have stockholders your one primary

2394.2 --> 2399.18
mission is to increase profit it's just

2396.54 --> 2402.15
insane that right it mean financial

2399.18 --> 2404.8489999999997
Isaac yeah I mean if I get a chair

2402.15 --> 2406.5
holders for example like Apple makes you

2404.849 --> 2408.27
know like say last year they made five

2406.5 --> 2410.329
billion dollars and then this year they

2408.27 --> 2413.329
make five billion oh because they didn't

2410.329 --> 2417.1400000000003
a growth the stock goes down I mean just

2413.329 --> 2420.65
the whole ideology behind that lunacy

2417.14 --> 2423.219
just seems well well by their very

2420.65 --> 2426.619
nature you know technocrats and global

2423.219 --> 2431.7490000000003
corporations are always an ultra

2426.619 --> 2435.0190000000002
conservative format you know and the the

2431.749 --> 2439.839
IPO and the floaty on the stock market

2435.019 --> 2442.6989999999996
creates a fake enchanting world in which

2439.839 --> 2448.459
the individual could profit from and

2442.699 --> 2452.7490000000003
what they seek to exploit is the century

2448.459 --> 2455.6299999999997
of the individual where might is right

2452.749 --> 2457.8799999999997
and greed is that's a that's what

2455.63 --> 2459.559
they're exploiting through the end of

2457.88 --> 2461.239
this are you pointing there are you

2459.559 --> 2461.779
borrowing that from century the Serbs

2461.239 --> 2464.719
self

2461.779 --> 2466.64
no no you know that documentary series

2464.719 --> 2469.91
right it's a bit a little bit no no no

2466.64 --> 2472.249
don't you don't know so much yet because

2469.91 --> 2474.3799999999997
it's reliable and predictable then look

2472.249 --> 2478.459
it up now and its century of the South

2474.38 --> 2482.15
because it's I think it's art the BBC

2478.459 --> 2483.769
miniseries you know obviously I was just

2482.15 --> 2486.319
thinking about you know people like

2483.769 --> 2488.1499999999996
Patti Smith and the punk movement you

2486.319 --> 2492.89
know became the movement of the

2488.15 --> 2495.469
individual okay and and or the the

2492.89 --> 2498.6189999999997
because that became about and became the

2495.469 --> 2501.89
norm then you know things like unions

2498.619 --> 2505.5190000000002
and cooperatives and communities started

2501.89 --> 2508.459
to disappear the power the power of the

2505.519 --> 2511.1299999999997
people so to speak got debased for the

2508.459 --> 2514.609
individual and replaced with a fake

2511.13 --> 2518.779
internet personal wealth greed kind of

2514.609 --> 2522.319
system you mean that media is taking no

2518.779 --> 2525.559
for the icons on which the youth

2522.319 --> 2527.209
reflects itself well it's not only that

2525.559 --> 2530.509
I mean if you you look at well there is

2527.209 --> 2534.069
very much present something in the UK

2530.509 --> 2536.719
the UK called out of Europe based on

2534.069 --> 2541.099
something as simple as a slogan placed

2536.719 --> 2541.369
on painted on something as simple as

2541.099 --> 2543.38
that

2541.369 --> 2549.98
it really irked

2543.38 --> 2555.859
are you talking about bricks it brexit

2549.98 --> 2560.859
is a widely voted concept so problematic

2555.859 --> 2563.9
because England's already so entangled

2560.859 --> 2566.269
and problematic and they don't didn't

2563.9 --> 2570.319
get the maneuvering room they had hoped

2566.269 --> 2572.6299999999997
for we're gonna get going but what I'm

2570.319 --> 2574.73
saying is like you don't know the

2572.63 --> 2577.4
political situation as we come to

2574.73 --> 2579.799
complex that's the problem

2577.4 --> 2583.609
that's why they just can't do it no but

2579.799 --> 2586.7
my original statement was the reason the

2583.609 --> 2589.94
vote went the way did it's because there

2586.7 --> 2591.6499999999996
was a simple slogan saying you know stop

2589.94 --> 2595.2200000000003
sending three hundred and forty five

2591.65 --> 2597.799
million to the EU we can spend it on the

2595.22 --> 2600.74
National Health Service which resonates

2597.799 --> 2604.96
with a lot of people but it was a lie

2600.74 --> 2606.859
and that influenced that one thing

2604.96 --> 2610.549
influenced now what would you know it

2606.859 --> 2612.95
was a lie if it's not gonna be down as

2610.549 --> 2614.509
you get we get more bang and the

2612.95 --> 2616.299
politician that actually came up with

2614.509 --> 2620.45
that slogan admitted it two weeks later

2616.299 --> 2622.25
that that would be impossible or it's

2620.45 --> 2624.95
not the same thing that is we had it

2622.25 --> 2627.38
being a lie it might have thought about

2624.95 --> 2629.66
it and didn't see a possibility for it

2627.38 --> 2632.299
because things have changed things can

2629.66 --> 2636.529
change in two weeks you did for my point

2632.299 --> 2638.809
is it was a lie no it's not it doesn't

2636.529 --> 2642.47
make it a lie just makes it not

2638.809 --> 2645.4100000000003
technically possible anymore a lie

2642.47 --> 2648.0789999999997
that's not a lie if it's not technically

2645.41 --> 2651.2
possible and you're advertising it if it

2648.079 --> 2654.259
was doesn't mean that it was a lie it

2651.2 --> 2656.5989999999997
could have been possible it not to be

2654.259 --> 2659.9
possible anymore that's not a lie yes

2656.599 --> 2665.289
just didn't work out that's how that's

2659.9 --> 2670.73
called well what could the mess for it

2665.289 --> 2673.88
it's a lie Ellen Ellen so I guess we're

2670.73 --> 2675.819
against brexit and you're mentioned

2673.88 --> 2676.9100000000003
unions and things like that

2675.819 --> 2680.66
you

2676.91 --> 2685.79
like pro-union and yes I'm very much for

2680.66 --> 2687.8599999999997
the people yeah it's a tricky thing I'm

2685.79 --> 2691.82
I think that's what you would I'm very

2687.86 --> 2694.57
individuality based I just I but you can

2691.82 --> 2697.31
you can still have that Eric um because

2694.57 --> 2700.19
it can still be an individual enough of

2697.31 --> 2703.5499999999997
empathy for yeah yeah I wanted to say

2700.19 --> 2705.38
listen I mean I'm very very okay lack of

2703.55 --> 2709.88
a better word an anarchist just symbols

2705.38 --> 2712.87
that I just collectivism just doesn't

2709.88 --> 2716.33
resonate with me it just seems like it

2712.87 --> 2722.0899999999997
I'm nots finance it's not for everybody

2716.33 --> 2725.24
but you know I think by uh nature where

2722.09 --> 2727.3700000000003
we do have cultures we do up tribes we

2725.24 --> 2733.1299999999997
do have collect a larger collective to

2727.37 --> 2734.96
look after I need yeah yeah I know the

2733.13 --> 2736.88
whole thing with people old man is a

2734.96 --> 2739.19
social animal well so is every species

2736.88 --> 2740.9
but that's still doesn't it doesn't

2739.19 --> 2743.23
really mean anything and again so yeah

2740.9 --> 2746.69
we need we need each other but I just I

2743.23 --> 2749.42
don't think forced collective forests so

2746.69 --> 2751.9
I'm not sculpting fools I mean it is for

2749.42 --> 2754.64
so Alan it is first you have to

2751.9 --> 2759.4100000000003
statism is a forced collective it's a

2754.64 --> 2761.06
forced Association a community yeah are

2759.41 --> 2765.08
you talking about forced or free

2761.06 --> 2767.06
voluntary free weights voluntary but

2765.08 --> 2769.79
there's a lot of tricks and peer

2767.06 --> 2773.0
pressure based systems that make people

2769.79 --> 2775.52
just do that taxation is one of them

2773.0 --> 2778.01
yeah but the thing is if you step out

2775.52 --> 2779.96
then suddenly a lot of things are just

2778.01 --> 2783.32
not gonna be possible or you could try

2779.96 --> 2785.2400000000002
but you'll become a criminal and yeah

2783.32 --> 2787.6400000000003
you're not a criminal but yeah you will

2785.24 --> 2788.87
be marked as one and treated as one so

2787.64 --> 2791.12
good luck with that

2788.87 --> 2793.79
you know it's all depends on what you

2791.12 --> 2797.0
want to do what you what possibilities

2793.79 --> 2798.62
do you need hey and if you are like in a

2797.0 --> 2800.89
remote area and you're completely

2798.62 --> 2805.12
self-sufficient and you have your own

2800.89 --> 2809.359
backup stuff radio transmitter self-made

2805.12 --> 2811.8489999999997
internet landlines whatever hey sure Axl

2809.359 --> 2815.089
excellent setup to actually achieve that

2811.849 --> 2817.73
and be sustainable but what's another

2815.089 --> 2819.499
just like oh you can just without any

2817.73 --> 2820.489
consequences no nothing is without

2819.499 --> 2824.6299999999997
consequences

2820.489 --> 2826.91
I'm pretty certain that listen as far as

2824.63 --> 2829.539
speaking economics and we've never

2826.91 --> 2833.69
really had well we kind of had but I I

2829.539 --> 2836.3190000000004
would say the free market and private

2833.69 --> 2838.73
business is probably the best economic

2836.319 --> 2840.049
scenario that's ever been and they've

2838.73 --> 2841.91
destroyed it in America I mean there's

2840.049 --> 2844.519
no more family businesses anymore you

2841.91 --> 2847.339
know Walmart destroyed it you only get

2844.519 --> 2852.6699999999996
two options Apple or Google for a phone

2847.339 --> 2855.38
and yeah I don't I don't know I think

2852.67 --> 2857.089
the Fremont I know it sounds cliche I

2855.38 --> 2860.63
hate even using the term because it

2857.089 --> 2864.739
sounds like Republican pipe dream which

2860.63 --> 2867.71
it is but I still think local

2864.739 --> 2869.96
family-owned private businesses whatever

2867.71 --> 2873.319
you want to call it maybe even coops

2869.96 --> 2874.96
I guess I'll borrow that from an America

2873.319 --> 2878.239
don't you call the mom and pop shops

2874.96 --> 2883.19
yeah but we don't have those anymore the

2878.239 --> 2886.13
only place you could again look yeah you

2883.19 --> 2890.4500000000003
know we can't go here all over the place

2886.13 --> 2892.069
again in the more we can't the

2890.45 --> 2893.48
regulations the rules and read the

2892.069 --> 2896.0589999999997
license and permits

2893.48 --> 2898.249
you can't not with the laws we have no

2896.059 --> 2900.65
you can't you can't even sell organic

2898.249 --> 2902.9889999999996
food because oh it's not FDA approved

2900.65 --> 2905.69
you're poisoning people you got it it's

2902.989 --> 2909.92
almost impossible Arlen well isn't that

2905.69 --> 2912.44
all federal basically yeah the federal

2909.92 --> 2915.259
laws are easily made and they're very

2912.44 --> 2918.41
much in the way you know also very very

2915.259 --> 2919.759
easily unmade if the right person is in

2918.41 --> 2923.779
the right place getting the right

2919.759 --> 2926.089
information so there is opportunity to

2923.779 --> 2930.95
reverse these kind of things in the

2926.089 --> 2933.68
coming period if there is but yeah first

2930.95 --> 2935.8999999999996
some people have to there has to be some

2933.68 --> 2938.8689999999997
actual moves of people going behind bars

2935.9 --> 2942.799
and the backlash of that and once that

2938.869 --> 2945.679
happens there's actual real room for

2942.799 --> 2947.779
quick positive change Trump had a good

2945.679 --> 2950.299
thing he was campaigning on of course he

2947.779 --> 2952.369
never mentioned again was for every law

2950.299 --> 2954.199
that's passed like two or three have to

2952.369 --> 2955.1890000000003
come off the books yeah brilliant that's

2954.199 --> 2958.369
a brilliant idea

2955.189 --> 2960.3089999999997
why don't we seeing that I mean if you

2958.369 --> 2963.469
ever looked at the the US tax code

2960.309 --> 2968.9790000000003
mm-hmm it's the biggest I happen but I

2963.469 --> 2975.2290000000003
heard about it the list is ridiculous

2968.979 --> 2978.499
mm-hmm it is so it can be overhauled but

2975.229 --> 2980.689
these things can't just be done under

2978.499 --> 2985.279
run has to be done during a very stable

2980.689 --> 2987.199
time the new ones got a hit probably

2985.279 --> 2989.089
like if there's bad results or while

2987.199 --> 2991.069
you're overhauling your system

2989.089 --> 2993.019
everybody's going to be very pissed off

2991.069 --> 2994.729
I don't think it's gonna come from

2993.019 --> 2996.2889999999998
government I think it's just it's gonna

2994.729 --> 2998.709
get to a point where it's kind of at a

2996.289 --> 3002.17
point where people are like oh it will

2998.709 --> 3007.4199999999996
obey them it will come through

3002.17 --> 3009.699
government I don't see that that they're

3007.42 --> 3011.949
going to change it it's very simple it's

3009.699 --> 3013.809
to the multitude of people are just

3011.949 --> 3017.049
gonna complain like this isn't working

3013.809 --> 3019.059
it's throwing away [ __ ] it's breaking

3017.049 --> 3021.999
things down then if somebody actually

3019.059 --> 3024.789
cares about the functionality of the

3021.999 --> 3029.439
economy of America for example then they

3024.789 --> 3032.4100000000003
can just really cut it down like

3029.439 --> 3035.469
simplify the taxes simplification is

3032.41 --> 3040.1189999999997
always better I don't see I'm pretty

3035.469 --> 3043.209
certain that any NGO any country could

3040.119 --> 3044.7090000000003
get by with maintain doing this stuff

3043.209 --> 3046.8999999999996
it's supposed to do getting out of

3044.709 --> 3048.819
people's lives and I think just a sales

3046.9 --> 3050.679
tax or bad to whatever you you know

3048.819 --> 3053.65
income tax property tax is just

3050.679 --> 3055.4100000000003
ludicrous ideology it is well that's the

3053.65 --> 3059.65
thing

3055.41 --> 3062.6499999999996
taxes if you allow them in your system

3059.65 --> 3065.199
at all and can be useful for limited

3062.65 --> 3069.039
government purposes then you should

3065.199 --> 3072.369
always text like one maybe two different

3069.039 --> 3075.1600000000003
types of income or money related

3072.369 --> 3076.63
transactions and leave certain things

3075.16 --> 3078.52
completely open

3076.63 --> 3082.42
because it will make things too complex

3078.52 --> 3085.39
for small-time business people that

3082.42 --> 3088.57
don't have like bookies just laying

3085.39 --> 3091.44
around so that's a good way to if you

3088.57 --> 3096.48
over sim if over if you simplify it and

3091.44 --> 3099.94
make it very clear how it works a good

3096.48 --> 3102.04
functional solid system that just will

3099.94 --> 3103.96
yield so much more result because don't

3102.04 --> 3106.15
be such an obstacle for so many people

3103.96 --> 3109.93
and people will not dislike it as much

3106.15 --> 3113.4700000000003
this is known in the early 20th century

3109.93 --> 3118.0
when people were actually kind of glad

3113.47 --> 3120.3399999999997
to pay tax a lot of them because they

3118.0 --> 3123.37
know it was really well and they wanted

3120.34 --> 3127.02
to contribute to the country see that

3123.37 --> 3129.64
that's it can happen if you get it right

3127.02 --> 3135.0099999999998
if you just get the circumstances right

3129.64 --> 3141.91
and the system so that's my

3135.01 --> 3144.01
recommendation was forget what about

3141.91 --> 3150.16
what year was but basically the US

3144.01 --> 3152.7400000000002
government yeah so prior to the 16th

3150.16 --> 3155.41
amendment of 1913 they're not really

3152.74 --> 3158.02
that long ago US government funded its

3155.41 --> 3160.0899999999997
operation mainly through excise taxes

3158.02 --> 3162.0099999999998
tariffs customs so basically just import

3160.09 --> 3164.4700000000003
taxes and lands you know selling off

3162.01 --> 3166.3300000000004
federal land there was no import tax it

3164.47 --> 3169.0
was none of this retail tax it was

3166.33 --> 3171.91
important what anyone but that sounds

3169.0 --> 3174.31
pretty much fairer now then will behead

3171.91 --> 3177.7
now I mean what's your import tax really

3174.31 --> 3179.95
not right I haven't checked it much

3177.7 --> 3181.6299999999997
lately it's well depends where it's

3179.95 --> 3184.0
coming from I guess right and since

3181.63 --> 3190.02
we're messing with China which is

3184.0 --> 3199.03
deserve it yeah oz is running at 20% v80

3190.02 --> 3204.91
locally and another 20% so 40% we're

3199.03 --> 3207.8700000000003
