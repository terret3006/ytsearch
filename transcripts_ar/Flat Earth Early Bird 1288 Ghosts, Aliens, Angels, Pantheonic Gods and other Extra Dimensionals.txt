so please do support me

91.84 --> 98.0
right so yeah the weather today is

95.6 --> 100.15899999999999
turning around even further it is quite

98.0 --> 101.84
hot actually

100.159 --> 105.2
look at those

101.84 --> 105.2
clouds there that that's

106.32 --> 113.0
that's an interesting sight

108.72 --> 113.0
fluffy clouds with like

114.24 --> 120.79899999999999
these veils hanging under them

118.64 --> 123.119
very interesting i've only ever seen

120.799 --> 124.799
that when in days where it is incredibly

123.119 --> 128.6
hot

124.799 --> 128.6
it just looks really

131.039 --> 133.51999999999998
unique

134.56 --> 138.4
over there it's the same thing

139.599 --> 144.23899999999998
like

140.84 --> 146.8
it's it's almost having like a weird

144.239 --> 148.879
prismatic effect

146.8 --> 152.0
it just seems like it is partially

148.879 --> 155.84
reflecting sunlight or something

152.0 --> 157.12
like it's almost a crepuscular ray

155.84 --> 160.48
like

157.12 --> 163.04
it's very odd and quite exciting

160.48 --> 163.04
interesting

164.0 --> 169.76
i wonder how much a webcam is going to

166.48 --> 172.23899999999998
be able to pick up from this

169.76 --> 172.239
effect

177.04 --> 181.47
anyhow

178.8 --> 184.52
it is freaking hot

181.47 --> 184.52
[Music]

188.319 --> 194.44
so it is wednesday the 29th of june 2022

198.42 --> 203.29999999999998
[Music]

203.36 --> 207.76000000000002
27 degrees celsius yep

208.08 --> 213.28
yeah

209.04 --> 215.599
temperatures shut up quite a bit

213.28 --> 217.599
so it's another hot day i'm kind of like

215.599 --> 219.11999999999998
here

217.599 --> 221.92
a bit sweaty

219.12 --> 221.92000000000002
because of this heat

223.519 --> 228.48000000000002
gotta make sure that this [ __ ] door

225.84 --> 231.84
stays open

228.48 --> 235.79899999999998
it doesn't sneakily close up so that i

231.84 --> 235.799
get cooked in and up

240.0 --> 243.76
nice

241.76 --> 245.439
because yeah the sun is still hitting

243.76 --> 247.599
this room

245.439 --> 250.07999999999998
it's going to take

247.599 --> 254.56
at least another half hour

250.08 --> 256.479
before it cools down to doable levels

254.56 --> 260.32
hey stubborn trafficking arrest ahead

256.479 --> 260.32
first in chat good to see you

264.16 --> 271.52000000000004
i was just before this

267.84 --> 273.59999999999997
watching quantum of consciousness video

271.52 --> 276.479
which is probably one of the best i've

273.6 --> 276.47900000000004
ever seen him do

277.28 --> 283.84
similar to the last time when i shared

279.28 --> 283.84
it but this time he's like really

285.36 --> 290.47900000000004
basically making a bit of

286.8 --> 290.479
interdimensional cosmogeny

291.199 --> 297.52000000000004
by reviewing this book called mothman

294.24 --> 299.759
mothman prophecies

297.52 --> 299.75899999999996
and

305.28 --> 310.88
like i can atone to pretty much

308.56 --> 312.56
everything that he's saying there

310.88 --> 314.24
because that's been my experience as

312.56 --> 316.479
well i've never read this book by the

314.24 --> 316.479
way

317.919 --> 323.19899999999996
i think i have talked to somebody that

321.12 --> 325.36
did read the book

323.199 --> 327.36
though

325.36 --> 329.6
and i did have elaborate conversations

327.36 --> 331.91900000000004
came to these same conclusions as matt

329.6 --> 334.40000000000003
is coming to

331.919 --> 336.479
and cross referenced it with pretty much

334.4 --> 339.19899999999996
everything i did i think i even learned

336.479 --> 341.36
about it before i made my symbolics dot

339.199 --> 343.199
in l site

341.36 --> 345.68
because it is all about

343.199 --> 350.32
well the accra gore

345.68 --> 350.32
as matt talks about plenty of times

350.72 --> 356.08000000000004
it's the expectation

353.84 --> 358.23999999999995
that basically

356.08 --> 361.12
manifests

358.24 --> 364.0
the oddity that is there to distract you

361.12 --> 365.759
further away into illusion

364.0 --> 369.28
on whatever

365.759 --> 369.28000000000003
train of thought or rather

369.68 --> 372.88
whatever canon

373.68 --> 378.639
drove that curiosity

376.08 --> 380.56
so if you're thinking about aliens a lot

378.639 --> 381.84000000000003
and about oh we're coming from another

380.56 --> 385.199
plant then

381.84 --> 388.23999999999995
the agrigore will manifest to you

385.199 --> 390.319
like a hallucination it might be routed

388.24 --> 391.84000000000003
in the same freaking effect of

390.319 --> 393.52000000000004
hallucinations

391.84 --> 397.67999999999995
but like more controlled

393.52 --> 397.68
will manifest like a hallucination

397.84 --> 402.79999999999995
an advancement or

400.56 --> 405.36
a lead that will bring you deeper down

402.8 --> 407.36
the rabbit hole of that same train of

405.36 --> 409.36
thinking

407.36 --> 411.52000000000004
it's like a hallucination that wants to

409.36 --> 415.28000000000003
pull you deeper in that's really the

411.52 --> 418.639
summary of it so utterly fascinated by

415.28 --> 420.84
the show and recommend you watch it

418.639 --> 424.16
if you're interested in what i talk

420.84 --> 425.599
about hence also the title of today's

424.16 --> 428.319
show

425.599 --> 431.28
so here's a link

428.319 --> 433.44
it's an hour eight minute video

431.28 --> 437.67999999999995
so yeah watch it some other time don't

433.44 --> 439.919
go watch it all now but take your time

437.68 --> 441.759
take your time to watch that and think

439.919 --> 444.15999999999997
about it carefully

441.759 --> 447.52000000000004
don't do it while doing other stuff you

444.16 --> 447.52000000000004
need some focus for this one

447.599 --> 453.039
hello flattersage good to see you bjc

450.319 --> 453.03900000000004
net clutch

459.12 --> 464.72
yeah this title title is intriguing i

462.84 --> 467.44
know i

464.72 --> 469.199
i just summed it all up so it's up to

467.44 --> 470.4
you on what you want to bring to the

469.199 --> 473.759
table

470.4 --> 477.44
to start reflecting upon this

473.759 --> 479.44
which ironically is exactly what like

477.44 --> 483.28
matt's presentation is about it's all

479.44 --> 485.919
about the expectation what is your

483.28 --> 489.19899999999996
what is your story what is your

485.919 --> 491.919
fascination which direction

489.199 --> 494.16
well the aggregor these or you could say

491.919 --> 496.4
the alien encounters

494.16 --> 499.36
this specific hallucination and i did my

496.4 --> 501.35999999999996
own personal research in this as well

499.36 --> 503.199
right i mentioned this like oh went to a

501.36 --> 504.96000000000004
ufo convention there was this couple

503.199 --> 507.599
that said oh we were abducted by aliens

504.96 --> 509.68
happens all the time and i asked them it

507.599 --> 511.919
just turned out they had no memories of

509.68 --> 513.599
a physical transition and they hadn't

511.919 --> 515.279
even realized that they weren't in a

513.599 --> 516.8000000000001
physical world

515.279 --> 519.4399999999999
when it happened

516.8 --> 522.3199999999999
right extra dimensional

519.44 --> 525.0400000000001
or like a hallucination but like

522.32 --> 528.0
controlled from the outside

525.04 --> 530.3199999999999
instead of it being spurred wildly by

528.0 --> 531.68
the internal

530.32 --> 534.32
the internal

531.68 --> 536.7199999999999
is like taken from the other dimension

534.32 --> 539.44
something comes takes a hold of that and

536.72 --> 543.76
then makes

539.44 --> 545.7600000000001
almost like a movie with it for you

543.76 --> 548.16
it's an outside

545.76 --> 549.6
force controlling the hallucination to

548.16 --> 553.76
manifest

549.6 --> 553.76
perfectly and seductively

558.0 --> 563.76
and i have literally gone through this

560.64 --> 567.04
when he said like oh yeah

563.76 --> 569.6
the the the men in black

567.04 --> 571.5999999999999
yeah they are very likely also extra

569.6 --> 574.08
dimensional and there is even bigger

571.6 --> 576.0
weirder mystery behind it all because

574.08 --> 578.8000000000001
all these manifestation might have

576.0 --> 582.0
originally be people

578.8 --> 584.88
that were like seduced

582.0 --> 586.32
probably under the guise of immortality

584.88 --> 589.76
or you need

586.32 --> 591.279
to be you need immortality to accomplish

589.76 --> 594.88
something right

591.279 --> 596.399
then they were probably transformed or

594.88 --> 598.08
assimilated

596.399 --> 601.68
into

598.08 --> 604.0790000000001
well detaching from god

601.68 --> 605.5999999999999
you could say and becoming an extra

604.079 --> 607.4399999999999
dimensional that's just still

605.6 --> 609.6800000000001
temporarily sitting

607.44 --> 611.36
on this throne of flesh but then

609.68 --> 613.92
afterward

611.36 --> 615.6800000000001
you don't go back to god

613.92 --> 618.56
to reincarnate you don't go back to the

615.68 --> 620.88
one by symbolics that are our cosmology

618.56 --> 624.079
to recycle

620.88 --> 626.8
but you stay

624.079 --> 632.279
you stay on the other side and then you

626.8 --> 632.279
might become a pawn that is simply there

632.399 --> 635.839
from

633.68 --> 637.68
your angle

635.839 --> 638.8000000000001
of approach of

637.68 --> 641.92
whatever

638.8 --> 644.8389999999999
seduced you to become that

641.92 --> 647.92
and then enact that upon the

644.839 --> 650.48
curious that are still living it is like

647.92 --> 652.56
almost like a pyramid scheme

650.48 --> 654.9590000000001
you get pulled in there the only thing

652.56 --> 656.64
you can still do

654.959 --> 659.3599999999999
besides living out your life and then

656.64 --> 662.72
dwelling forever is then seduce more

659.36 --> 662.72
into something similar

663.279 --> 668.48
sounds very much like a

666.079 --> 671.3599999999999
hellish devil set up if you really think

668.48 --> 671.36
about it carefully

672.48 --> 677.12
right so even these men in black might

674.56 --> 680.4799999999999
be indistinguishable from the supposed

677.12 --> 682.64
aliens not that they're the same thing

680.48 --> 682.64
but

683.12 --> 686.32
they might be

684.72 --> 689.279
like two

686.32 --> 691.6800000000001
sides of the same faction that fell for

689.279 --> 693.6
the same trick and then as it were on

691.68 --> 696.64
the other side they became virtual

693.6 --> 699.2
opponents within the story and the story

696.64 --> 701.8389999999999
is the seduction

699.2 --> 704.24
so i'm just very inspired by matt's

701.839 --> 704.24
stream

706.56 --> 712.1999999999999
i hope you're following my train of

708.8 --> 712.1999999999999
thinking here

721.36 --> 725.88
what okay rest ahead

731.839 --> 737.7600000000001
no no i'm not talking about that pjc net

735.279 --> 742.0
it's not about oh what did you see that

737.76 --> 743.68
one time what was the specificity of it

742.0 --> 746.16
what did it make you think of what did

743.68 --> 748.3199999999999
make it curious what did it make you

746.16 --> 750.0
curious off right that's not what i'm

748.32 --> 752.0
not talking about your personal

750.0 --> 755.04
eyewitness accounts

752.0 --> 755.92
or mine and i have had them

755.04 --> 759.8389999999999
right

755.92 --> 759.8389999999999
most prominently the ghost of my mother

760.48 --> 763.9200000000001
right

761.6 --> 766.0
it's not it's about

763.92 --> 772.16
the effect

766.0 --> 774.72
of it and how and why it manifests

772.16 --> 776.16
so all these formats that we get

774.72 --> 778.72
presented with

776.16 --> 781.519
are only secondary

778.72 --> 781.519
they're like the

783.279 --> 790.079
this the story is the seduction the

786.24 --> 790.0790000000001
story context is a seduction

790.639 --> 797.279
it's there to test you to tintilate you

792.8 --> 800.4799999999999
and perhaps pull you away from your life

797.279 --> 803.2
to deeper investigate the mystery of the

800.48 --> 805.04
encounter and what is behind it and that

803.2 --> 807.839
will pull you further away from your

805.04 --> 810.56
life it might eventually lead you to a

807.839 --> 811.6
seduction type moment if you let it get

810.56 --> 814.2399999999999
that far

811.6 --> 816.0790000000001
or you'll be offered do you want to be

814.24 --> 817.92
immortal do you want to be part of what

816.079 --> 822.2399999999999
we're doing

817.92 --> 824.639
and then if you say yes and you really

822.24 --> 824.639
mean it

825.519 --> 831.12
then you literally it's like selling

827.839 --> 831.12
your soul to the devil

831.6 --> 836.639
except it's not like all the

833.44 --> 838.399
establishment that's evil and in control

836.639 --> 841.519
level devil

838.399 --> 843.12
but rather like the very fundamental

841.519 --> 845.44
forces

843.12 --> 848.0
that we're comprised of and like where

845.44 --> 848.0
we're going

851.92 --> 856.24
so yeah

853.6 --> 859.279
by that consideration the devils are

856.24 --> 861.44
everywhere through our dreams to seduce

859.279 --> 864.0
us

861.44 --> 867.2790000000001
and if we grab too far

864.0 --> 868.16
then we get stuck in delusion

867.279 --> 871.68
and

868.16 --> 873.36
potentially even completely get

871.68 --> 878.199
lose

873.36 --> 878.1990000000001
the essence of being a human being

881.29 --> 890.88
[Music]

888.639 --> 892.88
right but i'm not calling it reality

890.88 --> 894.72
beats us

892.88 --> 896.399
because i don't

894.72 --> 898.48
put it all

896.399 --> 899.839
well yeah you could call it right

898.48 --> 903.44
reality

899.839 --> 905.9200000000001
god the design beats us what we want

903.44 --> 907.0400000000001
what we look for

905.92 --> 910.399
ask and

907.04 --> 910.399
you shall be provided

911.519 --> 918.9590000000001
but within this provision

915.68 --> 920.16
there is also the devil to seduce you

918.959 --> 921.8389999999999
away

920.16 --> 924.399
from it all

921.839 --> 926.9590000000001
so it's almost like the

924.399 --> 928.0
the adam and eve situation

926.959 --> 930.399
again

928.0 --> 932.16
right you can you can get everything you

930.399 --> 933.199
want there's just one thing you can't

932.16 --> 934.959
really do

933.199 --> 938.8389999999999
and one tree

934.959 --> 942.4799999999999
so guess what's gonna get shoved in your

938.839 --> 945.12
face right the seduction

942.48 --> 948.0
with all the aplenty

945.12 --> 950.48
all the provision of the design from god

948.0 --> 952.72
there is also the seduction it's like

950.48 --> 955.6
you're not getting everything for free

952.72 --> 959.72
without a challenge

955.6 --> 959.72
that's the gist of it

970.32 --> 973.6
right

971.199 --> 975.4399999999999
so clutch in that sense

973.6 --> 978.88
i started off saying ah it's not from

975.44 --> 980.24
god but it technically is though

978.88 --> 982.8
right

980.24 --> 985.6
and when you get honest the devil is

982.8 --> 985.5999999999999
from god

985.759 --> 990.0790000000001
it's all

986.959 --> 992.7199999999999
part of it all of it

990.079 --> 994.959
so it's more like an inherent

992.72 --> 994.9590000000001
thing

995.279 --> 999.8389999999999
you get everything well then you also

997.6 --> 1002.24
get the challenge

999.839 --> 1005.1990000000001
you you're only allowed to get

1002.24 --> 1007.519
everything if you can also risk losing

1005.199 --> 1011.399
it all

1007.519 --> 1011.399
that that could be the formula

1014.399 --> 1018.24
because otherwise this is all

1016.24 --> 1020.16
philosophically sounds

1018.24 --> 1023.04
if you just get everything and you don't

1020.16 --> 1025.6789999999999
have any risk losing it then it won't

1023.04 --> 1027.839
mean anything to you

1025.679 --> 1031.2800000000002
isn't that just familiar

1027.839 --> 1033.36
right so it's almost a blessing

1031.28 --> 1036.16
that god made it in a way

1033.36 --> 1037.6789999999999
the design for us that we could lose

1036.16 --> 1039.439
everything and that technically what we

1037.679 --> 1040.799
get on earth we do lose everything when

1039.439 --> 1044.4
we die

1040.799 --> 1046.16
because otherwise it wouldn't mean

1044.4 --> 1049.16
anything

1046.16 --> 1049.16
huh

1058.88 --> 1062.48
right

1059.84 --> 1064.1599999999999
okay pgcnet spiritual entities attached

1062.48 --> 1066.48
yeah well that's

1064.16 --> 1068.3200000000002
that's already more personified than it

1066.48 --> 1070.16
needs to be that's the beautiful thing

1068.32 --> 1071.2
about

1070.16 --> 1073.28
this

1071.2 --> 1076.4
mothman prophecies

1073.28 --> 1079.76
book and its conclusion and matt's

1076.4 --> 1082.64
quantum of consciousness review of that

1079.76 --> 1084.4
that if you say oh literal contract to

1082.64 --> 1086.4
the devil then they're bound to that

1084.4 --> 1091.16
devil that's

1086.4 --> 1091.16
like almost an over personification

1092.48 --> 1099.84
right because it's not always like that

1096.559 --> 1103.2
you could consider that if you get

1099.84 --> 1104.9599999999998
distracted by illusions

1103.2 --> 1107.3600000000001
by myths

1104.96 --> 1108.48
that will absolutely not help you in the

1107.36 --> 1110.0
real world

1108.48 --> 1112.559
with other people

1110.0 --> 1114.96
only serve to distract them as well that

1112.559 --> 1117.44
that could be considered to be being

1114.96 --> 1120.0
possessed by a demon as well because

1117.44 --> 1121.76
what what is satan

1120.0 --> 1123.76
it's lies

1121.76 --> 1125.919
what is a giant distraction that will

1123.76 --> 1127.84
not help you with anything practical in

1125.919 --> 1130.0
the real world

1127.84 --> 1132.08
a lie

1130.0 --> 1137.44
right it doesn't have to be

1132.08 --> 1139.12
an entity that is dominating your entity

1137.44 --> 1141.2
a personification

1139.12 --> 1143.84
effect right this is a very bordering to

1141.2 --> 1147.52
physicality assumption bias

1143.84 --> 1149.4399999999998
to make it into an individual that we as

1147.52 --> 1152.08
an individual face well it doesn't have

1149.44 --> 1156.96
to be like that it could just be a

1152.08 --> 1156.96
situation an idea a dream

1159.76 --> 1165.16
doesn't have to be a personified thing

1166.3 --> 1169.49
[Music]

1187.12 --> 1193.36
was lucifer's defiance in heaven part of

1189.44 --> 1195.679
god's plan it would have to be

1193.36 --> 1195.6789999999999
i mean

1195.84 --> 1200.0
if it wasn't

1197.28 --> 1202.799
then the creator is not god throughout

1200.0 --> 1204.08
time and space alpha and omega

1202.799 --> 1207.52
right

1204.08 --> 1209.12
the only logical conclusion godzilla can

1207.52 --> 1212.72
be

1209.12 --> 1215.039
that it's all his plan all of it

1212.72 --> 1218.0
everything that happens no matter how

1215.039 --> 1221.679
atrocious no matter how maddening no

1218.0 --> 1222.88
matter how unexpected

1221.679 --> 1224.159
no matter

1222.88 --> 1226.96
how much

1224.159 --> 1230.72
in a way we didn't expect it

1226.96 --> 1233.679
it's all his plan because he is a master

1230.72 --> 1237.1200000000001
of time and space

1233.679 --> 1237.1200000000001
god the creator

1237.44 --> 1242.24
right and the adversary

1240.72 --> 1244.88
satan

1242.24 --> 1247.52
is merely a force it's merely a

1244.88 --> 1250.72
balancing force of the matrix the

1247.52 --> 1252.1589999999999
creation the design that we are a part

1250.72 --> 1254.559
of

1252.159 --> 1256.24
it is a natural element that has to be

1254.559 --> 1259.039
there

1256.24 --> 1263.039
it is inherent to the design

1259.039 --> 1266.44
or not even to the design to design

1263.039 --> 1266.44
in general

1281.039 --> 1284.84
hey seeking star wars

1300.0 --> 1304.559
yeah the adversary adversary is a good

1302.48 --> 1306.799
word for it

1304.559 --> 1306.799
but

1308.96 --> 1315.679
every suggestion that i've ever heard

1311.52 --> 1316.96
from any person in the world to say

1315.679 --> 1320.88
but

1316.96 --> 1323.8400000000001
god didn't expect this did he

1320.88 --> 1326.0
every time i hear that i don't even have

1323.84 --> 1327.84
to hear the context i immediately have

1326.0 --> 1330.84
this response

1327.84 --> 1330.84
oh

1331.33 --> 1335.28
[Music]

1332.96 --> 1335.28
dumb

1337.36 --> 1342.3999999999999
it it basically to me means so you don't

1340.08 --> 1345.6
trust god then

1342.4 --> 1348.799
oh you you personified him

1345.6 --> 1350.48
oh oh you made it less

1348.799 --> 1352.6399999999999
did you

1350.48 --> 1354.48
so you don't think god is the alpha and

1352.64 --> 1356.64
the omega

1354.48 --> 1360.2
all things throughout time the designer

1356.64 --> 1360.2
of all things

1375.44 --> 1378.96
yes stubborn traffic of arrest height

1377.12 --> 1381.039
innate goodness

1378.96 --> 1385.799
the creator

1381.039 --> 1385.799
it's not arbitrary it's just

1388.0 --> 1392.32
escapist

1390.0 --> 1394.24
i mean again the formula applies

1392.32 --> 1397.36
ignorance is bliss

1394.24 --> 1400.48
if you exclude all forms of darkness in

1397.36 --> 1402.8799999999999
every little way in your behavior

1400.48 --> 1404.96
then you're going to be very bliss

1402.88 --> 1407.3600000000001
but you're also just not going to be

1404.96 --> 1409.6000000000001
capable

1407.36 --> 1410.4799999999998
of

1409.6 --> 1412.1589999999999
well

1410.48 --> 1414.559
approaching

1412.159 --> 1414.5590000000002
evil

1415.679 --> 1418.3200000000002
right

1416.4 --> 1422.72
and eventually everything you're

1418.32 --> 1422.72
ignorant of you lose understanding of

1422.799 --> 1425.9189999999999
and that's just a fact

1428.84 --> 1433.9189999999999
right you can't overcome evil through

1432.32 --> 1436.32
ignorance

1433.919 --> 1436.3200000000002
never

1440.48 --> 1446.24
if you only avoid evil then you will

1442.88 --> 1447.2
never understand evil and then evil

1446.24 --> 1451.64
will

1447.2 --> 1451.64
end up ruling you

1459.039 --> 1465.36
the original consciousness what are you

1461.12 --> 1465.36
talking about original consciousness

1466.559 --> 1471.12
if you're talking about god then no

1471.52 --> 1474.96
god

1472.72 --> 1478.4
is outside of

1474.96 --> 1480.64
the design he made it he made time and

1478.4 --> 1484.8400000000001
space

1480.64 --> 1488.0800000000002
before the design there was no time you

1484.84 --> 1490.0
see there's no mistake

1488.08 --> 1493.279
there never was

1490.0 --> 1496.159
mistake is an earthly concept

1493.279 --> 1500.72
bound by time and space

1496.159 --> 1503.3600000000001
you could say god designed mistakes

1500.72 --> 1507.1200000000001
as part of the design because that is

1503.36 --> 1508.1589999999999
the thing that makes it go

1507.12 --> 1512.4799999999998
right

1508.159 --> 1514.96
you don't need mistakes in timelessness

1512.48 --> 1516.559
because it's timeless

1514.96 --> 1519.3600000000001
there's no purpose

1516.559 --> 1520.3999999999999
if there is a finite amount of time

1519.36 --> 1523.6
then

1520.4 --> 1525.6000000000001
there is a growth curve option for the

1523.6 --> 1528.3999999999999
spirit

1525.6 --> 1532.84
mistakes are the thing

1528.4 --> 1532.8400000000001
that stimulate us to grow

1536.11 --> 1539.3
[Music]

1542.24 --> 1546.4
all right mistakes not just a human

1543.84 --> 1550.1589999999999
concept it's an earthly concept

1546.4 --> 1550.159
it's a material concept

1550.32 --> 1554.24
spirit

1551.679 --> 1557.64
in the material

1554.24 --> 1557.64
makes mistakes

1560.72 --> 1563.76
right

1561.679 --> 1566.0800000000002
arguably like what how does it work

1563.76 --> 1567.279
outside of the material well you make

1566.08 --> 1569.039
choices

1567.279 --> 1570.559
outside of the material you just make

1569.039 --> 1572.72
choices

1570.559 --> 1574.96
in the material you also make choices

1572.72 --> 1577.679
but mostly you make mistakes and learn

1574.96 --> 1579.8400000000001
from them to understand things better

1577.679 --> 1582.4
because you don't understand everything

1579.84 --> 1584.24
starting out you learn

1582.4 --> 1585.3600000000001
in timelessness there is no learning

1584.24 --> 1588.64
curve

1585.36 --> 1589.6789999999999
you simply understand

1588.64 --> 1593.2
and then

1589.679 --> 1593.2
perhaps you can choose

1593.279 --> 1599.12
if there is a purpose for it usually in

1595.919 --> 1601.1200000000001
reflection to still a time-bound thing

1599.12 --> 1603.76
is even the timelessness

1601.12 --> 1605.039
only ever changes

1603.76 --> 1607.84
because

1605.039 --> 1610.559
of the time bound

1607.84 --> 1612.799
ever considered that i mean this is

1610.559 --> 1616.84
hyper mechanical

1612.799 --> 1616.84
how i'm thinking right now

1621.78 --> 1624.94
[Music]

1626.32 --> 1628.6399999999999
right

1628.799 --> 1634.08
without the material there would have

1630.72 --> 1634.08
been no change

1634.159 --> 1637.8400000000001
material

1635.44 --> 1641.039
realm the existence of it is the factor

1637.84 --> 1644.9599999999998
that created change

1641.039 --> 1644.96
even outside of itself

1645.84 --> 1649.72
this is only logical

1659.76 --> 1663.84
all right so that in that sense you

1661.36 --> 1666.9599999999998
could think even of the

1663.84 --> 1669.52
adam and eve story

1666.96 --> 1673.039
paradise eden

1669.52 --> 1674.799
that it was simply the design phase

1673.039 --> 1677.6
that's always how i think of it it's

1674.799 --> 1680.32
just the it

1677.6 --> 1684.08
it's like the prototype

1680.32 --> 1685.6789999999999
where every form of life was designed

1684.08 --> 1687.6789999999999
during that phase everything was

1685.679 --> 1690.0800000000002
designed and then it's like okay i

1687.679 --> 1693.039
designed everything i can

1690.08 --> 1695.6789999999999
now let's initiate time

1693.039 --> 1697.6
oh okay satan

1695.679 --> 1699.52
i'm afraid you're gonna be the one to

1697.6 --> 1701.52
have to initiate this realize that

1699.52 --> 1704.48
you're gonna get the blame for this from

1701.52 --> 1706.08
all consciousness for all eternity

1704.48 --> 1708.3990000000001
satan says

1706.08 --> 1712.32
i am

1708.399 --> 1714.9599999999998
i am as strong as you need me to be lord

1712.32 --> 1714.96
i will do

1715.039 --> 1720.96
that's foretold

1717.039 --> 1720.96
and then he seduced eve

1721.12 --> 1724.8799999999999
the trixie however that went with the

1723.039 --> 1726.559
apple and then

1724.88 --> 1728.0
god kicked them out

1726.559 --> 1731.039
out of this

1728.0 --> 1732.799
timeless paradise situation or

1731.039 --> 1737.96
in other words

1732.799 --> 1737.96
he initiated the time-based world

1738.96 --> 1743.52
where everything does work differently

1740.72 --> 1744.24
it's not just there as a prototype

1743.52 --> 1746.24
to

1744.24 --> 1748.559
show its existence

1746.24 --> 1750.159
now everything actually has to

1748.559 --> 1752.559
survive

1750.159 --> 1755.0390000000002
go through the time cycles

1752.559 --> 1759.279
i always thought eden is the prototype

1755.039 --> 1759.279
where god designed all the life

1759.36 --> 1765.6
and then when he kicked out adam and eve

1762.72 --> 1768.24
that's when the time-bound reality

1765.6 --> 1771.4399999999998
started that's when the third dimension

1768.24 --> 1771.44
was initiated

1773.52 --> 1778.24
or degraded you could say but it's not

1775.919 --> 1781.039
relevant right by the way this is all

1778.24 --> 1782.88
also described

1781.039 --> 1786.559
in

1782.88 --> 1786.5590000000002
my chart of the dimensions

1792.48 --> 1797.3990000000001
which you can find over here

1812.799 --> 1816.08
god isn't timeless

1814.559 --> 1818.6399999999999
yes he is

1816.08 --> 1820.1589999999999
he's outside

1818.64 --> 1824.88
and whatever

1820.159 --> 1826.159
things that we can't send to us

1824.88 --> 1828.0800000000002
whether it be

1826.159 --> 1830.64
god demon

1828.08 --> 1830.6399999999999
alien

1831.6 --> 1838.24
that that's not the creator you see

1835.44 --> 1840.64
they might be attuned with

1838.24 --> 1843.2
the creator in a way

1840.64 --> 1846.3200000000002
but they are separate because they exist

1843.2 --> 1846.32
in the physical realm

1846.799 --> 1851.279
or in the

1848.559 --> 1853.36
other side realm in the in the

1851.279 --> 1855.52
in the spiritual realm outside of the

1853.36 --> 1859.4399999999998
physical reality they might be remnants

1855.52 --> 1863.279
of the original eden even some of it

1859.44 --> 1864.96
right and arguably so are angels

1863.279 --> 1868.0
angels

1864.96 --> 1870.799
pantheonic gods

1868.0 --> 1871.84
and well aliens and men in black would

1870.799 --> 1872.96
be

1871.84 --> 1876.559
the more

1872.96 --> 1878.96
modern timeline based versions

1876.559 --> 1881.9189999999999
that might have even they like

1878.96 --> 1883.919
that could literally be like hercules

1881.919 --> 1887.279
type stories

1883.919 --> 1889.1200000000001
right people originally human beings i

1887.279 --> 1891.76
don't know whether they were special

1889.12 --> 1894.8799999999999
boys or not

1891.76 --> 1896.8799999999999
were approached by entities from the

1894.88 --> 1899.919
other dimension

1896.88 --> 1901.1200000000001
from the timeless realm

1899.919 --> 1903.6000000000001
and then

1901.12 --> 1905.279
lifted out

1903.6 --> 1911.279
like

1905.279 --> 1913.76
zeus would go to earth impregnated woman

1911.279 --> 1916.64
[ __ ] around with it for a while

1913.76 --> 1918.399
let them go through trials and then lift

1916.64 --> 1919.919
them up

1918.399 --> 1922.6399999999999
to mount

1919.919 --> 1922.64
olympus

1924.32 --> 1926.96
right

1925.2 --> 1931.279
so the men in black

1926.96 --> 1934.279
phenomenon the aliens might be the same

1931.279 --> 1934.279
effect

1935.519 --> 1940.64
in a modern day

1937.6 --> 1945.1589999999999
where the story reflects modern day

1940.64 --> 1945.159
thinking and ideas and fantasies

1952.96 --> 1957.919
kind of like prometheus bringing fire

1956.559 --> 1960.9189999999999
apollo

1957.919 --> 1960.919
yeah

1963.519 --> 1969.36
well apollo could be that too could be

1965.679 --> 1969.3600000000001
the extra dimensional entity

1971.039 --> 1974.32
riding

1972.24 --> 1978.3990000000001
on people

1974.32 --> 1981.2
beholding fire like at a volcano

1978.399 --> 1984.2399999999998
or a forest fire beholding it and just

1981.2 --> 1985.8400000000001
being like oh my god what is this

1984.24 --> 1989.279
this is

1985.84 --> 1991.279
heavy this is something supernatural

1989.279 --> 1993.12
and then apollo might have come through

1991.279 --> 1997.519
dreams and be like

1993.12 --> 1997.5189999999998
you can master that you can take that

1999.519 --> 2002.48
to seduce them

2003.039 --> 2006.72
to help them chase their dream

2005.14 --> 2009.279
[Music]

2006.72 --> 2011.6000000000001
or rather give them that dream right

2009.279 --> 2013.6
through a dream

2011.6 --> 2018.039
this is all connecting

2013.6 --> 2018.039
like all of it is connecting

2034.0 --> 2037.6
but you're not listening metal slugs

2035.6 --> 2040.799
cockatiel

2037.6 --> 2044.24
you're literally not listening

2040.799 --> 2044.24
it's just the story

2045.36 --> 2049.52
right the gods

2047.519 --> 2053.56
in the greek pantheon

2049.52 --> 2053.56
is a story

2053.839 --> 2059.44
you understand

2056.159 --> 2064.399
that is the point the point is that none

2059.44 --> 2066.879
of it ever actually physically exists

2064.399 --> 2069.2799999999997
none of it

2066.879 --> 2069.2799999999997
ever

2073.44 --> 2082.839
the pantheoni gods

2076.96 --> 2082.839
are not god are not the designer

2113.839 --> 2117.2
dude i didn't give a [ __ ] gadget

2115.92 --> 2120.16
inspector

2117.2 --> 2122.56
what freaking cats does i don't give a

2120.16 --> 2122.56
[ __ ]

2122.96 --> 2127.839
if he wants to become a flat earther or

2125.2 --> 2129.68
something good for him we'll see i don't

2127.839 --> 2134.359
really care dude that guy's been an

2129.68 --> 2134.359
anti-flat earther for a long time

2151.2 --> 2156.0789999999997
uh no hello from down under stories of

2154.72 --> 2158.64
our god

2156.079 --> 2162.0
stories as well depends on which story

2158.64 --> 2166.4
you see i don't have a story

2162.0 --> 2169.119
of the god big g god yeah because it's

2166.4 --> 2171.76
an ontological primitive it's a logical

2169.119 --> 2174.96
conclusion it is a necessity it's not a

2171.76 --> 2176.8
story there's no story

2174.96 --> 2179.44
i mean there are stories

2176.8 --> 2180.32
those stories are merely attempts

2179.44 --> 2182.079
to

2180.32 --> 2186.96
iconify

2182.079 --> 2189.44
logical consistent necessities

2186.96 --> 2190.64
it's not a story that the designer

2189.44 --> 2193.839
exists

2190.64 --> 2196.4
outside the time and space and that he

2193.839 --> 2198.839
is in control of all things

2196.4 --> 2202.96
at all

2198.839 --> 2204.72
time and that he does not simply abide

2202.96 --> 2205.599
by our

2204.72 --> 2208.16
will

2205.599 --> 2208.1600000000003
like that

2209.119 --> 2212.8
right we

2210.8 --> 2216.1600000000003
personify god

2212.8 --> 2217.44
that's what we do in our minds and in

2216.16 --> 2220.8799999999997
our hearts

2217.44 --> 2223.04
and turn him into some kind of a wussy

2220.88 --> 2225.44
or

2223.04 --> 2228.0
whatever however you're seeing it

2225.44 --> 2229.04
right oh god would never do that yeah he

2228.0 --> 2231.04
would

2229.04 --> 2233.119
he designed all of it he's accounted for

2231.04 --> 2235.599
all of it all the atrocities you can

2233.119 --> 2236.88
imagine and way beyond

2235.599 --> 2240.32
it's all

2236.88 --> 2242.88
part of the design

2240.32 --> 2245.839
all serves a function it's just not the

2242.88 --> 2247.92
function you want

2245.839 --> 2250.56
in that moment

2247.92 --> 2252.7200000000003
because you don't understand the design

2250.56 --> 2253.839
because you are not it you're not the

2252.72 --> 2257.2799999999997
designer

2253.839 --> 2261.04
you're a time-bound being

2257.28 --> 2263.599
while in this earthly vessel

2261.04 --> 2267.72
with your contemporary

2263.599 --> 2267.7200000000003
personified opinions

2281.599 --> 2286.96
dude what the [ __ ] are you black dude

2284.88 --> 2289.119
you do you got some lip here

2286.96 --> 2290.32
hello from down under visiting since

2289.119 --> 2293.6800000000003
yesterday

2290.32 --> 2297.6800000000003
it's not abstract nonsense

2293.68 --> 2301.44
it is very clear cut out

2297.68 --> 2301.44
direct description

2302.64 --> 2306.92
it is anything but abstract

2324.68 --> 2329.5989999999997
understand the i don't understand the

2327.92 --> 2334.4
creator

2329.599 --> 2334.4
or well legally i understand the creator

2335.28 --> 2340.5600000000004
i understand

2337.76 --> 2343.5200000000004
i don't comprehend everything about the

2340.56 --> 2346.56
creator like the only thing i comprehend

2343.52 --> 2348.64
about the creator is that he comprehends

2346.56 --> 2350.72
it all

2348.64 --> 2354.0
there's a reason for everything and that

2350.72 --> 2356.0
my petty little contemporary mind even

2354.0 --> 2358.72
though much faster and much more

2356.0 --> 2362.24
cohesive than most

2358.72 --> 2365.5989999999997
is not going to ever be able technically

2362.24 --> 2367.4399999999996
at any point to get him

2365.599 --> 2369.52
you see

2367.44 --> 2370.88
man can never

2369.52 --> 2372.4
overcome

2370.88 --> 2373.28
their designer

2372.4 --> 2375.28
ever

2373.28 --> 2378.1600000000003
it is physically impossible it's about

2375.28 --> 2378.1600000000003
as possible

2378.56 --> 2383.599
as as a goldfish

2380.72 --> 2385.5989999999997
being able to redesign their own fish

2383.599 --> 2387.839
boil bowl yeah

2385.599 --> 2389.52
that's how possible it is

2387.839 --> 2391.2799999999997
for a human being

2389.52 --> 2392.72
to truly

2391.28 --> 2395.28
comprehend

2392.72 --> 2396.56
the creator

2395.28 --> 2399.599
you can't

2396.56 --> 2401.359
you're not supposed to be able to while

2399.599 --> 2405.6800000000003
in this vessel

2401.359 --> 2409.56
your vessel was not designed to be able

2405.68 --> 2409.56
to handle that

2444.24 --> 2448.4799999999996
insecure to need

2447.04 --> 2452.48
ah

2448.48 --> 2453.92
somebody's a logic denier

2452.48 --> 2456.88
you don't believe in ontological

2453.92 --> 2459.359
primitives huh huh

2456.88 --> 2462.079
so you don't believe in physics you

2459.359 --> 2464.64
don't believe in knowing

2462.079 --> 2466.48
you don't believe in logical consistent

2464.64 --> 2469.44
structure do you

2466.48 --> 2469.44
from down under

2469.839 --> 2475.7999999999997
are you into politics

2472.319 --> 2475.8
are you a politician

2484.319 --> 2489.92
logic law

2486.319 --> 2492.839
yeah hello right at you

2489.92 --> 2496.8
you're the one that's laughing at

2492.839 --> 2499.359
logic that's so funny

2496.8 --> 2499.3590000000004
loony bin

2500.88 --> 2505.2000000000003
go [ __ ] go find your citation

2503.839 --> 2508.72
huh

2505.2 --> 2510.8799999999997
or where logic is just something to be

2508.72 --> 2512.0789999999997
laughed at go find your citation other

2510.88 --> 2515.2000000000003
than

2512.079 --> 2516.8
something brenda blabber

2515.2 --> 2518.8799999999997
on some

2516.8 --> 2521.88
youtube show somewhere

2518.88 --> 2521.88
huh

2528.96 --> 2534.079
believing in a magic creator's logical

2531.119 --> 2535.6800000000003
no it isn't it is a ontological

2534.079 --> 2539.52
primitive

2535.68 --> 2541.7599999999998
it exists cannot be

2539.52 --> 2544.48
without it

2541.76 --> 2545.3590000000004
dumb [ __ ]

2544.48 --> 2546.48
yeah

2545.359 --> 2549.48
physics

2546.48 --> 2553.119
physics argument

2549.48 --> 2555.359
existence cannot be

2553.119 --> 2558.4
without it

2555.359 --> 2558.4
dumb [ __ ]

2558.72 --> 2564.24
you understand

2560.48 --> 2566.96
probably not because you're a dumb [ __ ]

2564.24 --> 2569.52
that thinks laughing

2566.96 --> 2573.52
after logic is

2569.52 --> 2576.079
like that's something to laugh over

2573.52 --> 2576.079
dumb [ __ ]

2576.88 --> 2581.119
supernatural being being you say

2580.079 --> 2583.119
wow

2581.119 --> 2585.839
so you're already personifying you

2583.119 --> 2587.76
simply don't have the faculties do you

2585.839 --> 2589.359
you numb nuts

2587.76 --> 2592.8
dumb [ __ ]

2589.359 --> 2597.2
you don't have the senses to actually

2592.8 --> 2602.4
step outside of regular conventional

2597.2 --> 2602.3999999999996
opinion can ya you dumb [ __ ]

2605.04 --> 2610.72
get the [ __ ] out of my chat you numpty

2608.079 --> 2610.7200000000003
[ __ ]

2612.079 --> 2617.2000000000003
probably like brenda or something what a

2614.96 --> 2620.76
piece of [ __ ]

2617.2 --> 2620.7599999999998
dumb [ __ ]

2626.38 --> 2629.559
[Music]

2635.839 --> 2638.839
hmm

2649.44 --> 2654.64
axiom yeah it's true

2652.16 --> 2657.44
an ontological primitive is part of

2654.64 --> 2659.5989999999997
logic metal slugs cockatiel

2657.44 --> 2661.599
you're surprised i come up with it that

2659.599 --> 2663.52
i use that argument yeah because it's

2661.599 --> 2666.8
solid logic

2663.52 --> 2666.8
it's fundamental

2674.96 --> 2680.079
a physicalist no it's called

2677.92 --> 2682.4
physicist

2680.079 --> 2687.92
somebody

2682.4 --> 2688.839
dabbles in the field of physics

2687.92 --> 2692.0
not a

2688.839 --> 2692.7999999999997
physicalist that's not a thing

2692.0 --> 2694.8
yeah

2692.8 --> 2696.5600000000004
i don't exclude

2694.8 --> 2699.8390000000004
the supernatural

2696.56 --> 2703.599
the spiritual as you all know and to

2699.839 --> 2706.56
suggest that is a straight out

2703.599 --> 2709.599
insult that is just not

2706.56 --> 2711.359
that yeah you can't justify that

2709.599 --> 2713.52
metals lux coca-cola to say something

2711.359 --> 2717.119
like that something as insulting as that

2713.52 --> 2719.7599999999998
you can't justify doing that

2717.119 --> 2721.599
i'm literally defining [ __ ] spirit

2719.76 --> 2724.96
mechanics here

2721.599 --> 2728.319
yeah to call me a physicalist

2724.96 --> 2732.52
that's an embarrassing thing to say

2728.319 --> 2732.52
by you you understand

2736.079 --> 2741.2000000000003
physics study physical natural world

2739.599 --> 2742.56
using science

2741.2 --> 2744.839
and logic

2742.56 --> 2748.72
what is

2744.839 --> 2753.68
conclusions and inquiries

2748.72 --> 2756.7999999999997
an ontological primitive is part of that

2753.68 --> 2757.9199999999996
that's not physicalist

2756.8 --> 2759.44
that's

2757.92 --> 2763.92
logic

2759.44 --> 2767.599
that is the only way it can be

2763.92 --> 2770.56
that's what an ontological primitive is

2767.599 --> 2773.04
if you don't understand that then you're

2770.56 --> 2776.48
just ill-informed

2773.04 --> 2779.8
or really dumb and stubborn

2776.48 --> 2779.8

dichotomy metal slugs cocktail why are

2814.56 --> 2818.0
you trying to set me up with this

2816.48 --> 2820.0
garbage

2818.0 --> 2823.119
like are you just in one of those days

2820.0 --> 2825.839
where you just can't seem to

2823.119 --> 2829.52
get onto track

2825.839 --> 2831.7599999999998
this is an off day metal slugs cocktail

2829.52 --> 2834.72
because what you're saying is making

2831.76 --> 2836.4
very little sense you just seem to be

2834.72 --> 2840.48
defiant

2836.4 --> 2840.48
without logical foundation there

2842.8 --> 2847.76

2859.92 --> 2866.319

2881.04 --> 2886.16
watch the flat earth debate some more

2884.48 --> 2888.0
actually learn what the [ __ ] you're

2886.16 --> 2890.16
talking about

you can't bluff your way through with

2890.16 --> 2896.0
this garbage yeah

2892.24 --> 2898.24
i've mastered these subjects

2896.0 --> 2901.92
mastered them

2898.24 --> 2904.7999999999997
do you hear if you're gonna blabber your

2901.92 --> 2907.04
way through thinking that you caught me

2904.8 --> 2911.319
on something you're gonna be highly

2907.04 --> 2911.319
disappointed and embarrassed

2915.28 --> 2923.3190000000004
and band if you keep nagging about it

2919.28 --> 2923.3190000000004
and not find some humility

2929.359 --> 2933.7599999999998
hello by the way godzilla

beside the atheist numpty invasion what

2941.2 --> 2945.5989999999997
a bunch of retards atheists are

2943.92 --> 2948.48
unforgivably

2945.599 --> 2948.48
[ __ ]

2950.88 --> 2954.839
any atheists that thinks their intellect

2953.68 --> 2957.9199999999996
are like

2954.839 --> 2960.7999999999997
juveniles juvenile

2957.92 --> 2963.52
mental delinquents that think that

2960.8 --> 2964.8
they're already adult no you're just a

2963.52 --> 2967.119
[ __ ]

2964.8 --> 2968.079
you don't actually think things through

2967.119 --> 2970.8
ever

2968.079 --> 2973.6800000000003
you're probably afraid

2970.8 --> 2976.0
afraid of all that mighty attention from

2973.68 --> 2978.24
creation and god you don't want the

2976.0 --> 2979.839
attention you want to be your own little

2978.24 --> 2981.7599999999998
special boy

2979.839 --> 2984.4
in the void

2981.76 --> 2986.7200000000003
in the abyss don't you

2984.4 --> 2986.7200000000003
huh

2994.48 --> 3000.2400000000002
i'm intelligent oh yeah yeah who

2996.24 --> 3000.24
designed your intelligence uh

3000.72 --> 3006.64
nobody designed my intelligence

3004.079 --> 3011.3590000000004
i designed it myself

3006.64 --> 3012.8799999999997
it just mutated mutated from

3011.359 --> 3016.14
bacteria

3012.88 --> 3017.28
you just mutated and then became smart

3016.14 --> 3021.5989999999997
[Music]

3017.28 --> 3024.0
because things just become smart

3021.599 --> 3025.04
right

3024.0 --> 3027.68
you just

3025.04 --> 3030.8
build

3027.68 --> 3034.0
skill abilities and

3030.8 --> 3036.319
intermittent brain processes and

3034.0 --> 3038.4
yes of course that just

3036.319 --> 3040.96
naturally develops out of nowhere it

3038.4 --> 3042.7200000000003
just mutates into being

3040.96 --> 3046.0
yes

3042.72 --> 3046.0
yes of course

3052.88 --> 3061.28
yeah we got now we got definite uh

3055.92 --> 3061.28
derpcon 4 level activity in chat today

3064.48 --> 3067.2
but that's fine it's not going to stop

3066.48 --> 3068.4
me

3067.2 --> 3072.24
i'm on a roll

3068.4 --> 3072.2400000000002
and nothing's gonna ruin that

3072.319 --> 3076.5589999999997
not even a bunch of numpty [ __ ] that

3074.8 --> 3078.559
are gonna make me ban them and then yell

3076.559 --> 3081.559
at them it's still not gonna ruin the

3078.559 --> 3081.559
show

3089.76 --> 3093.0400000000004
because

3090.88 --> 3096.7200000000003
everything i talked about so far it

3093.04 --> 3099.599
stands every detail and you can inquire

3096.72 --> 3102.24
more as long as you just don't address

3099.599 --> 3104.319
this singular person

3102.24 --> 3107.1189999999997
because this one person that's making

3104.319 --> 3108.96
sakaka it's that one guy again

3107.119 --> 3111.52
just him

3108.96 --> 3113.44
don't talk to him stick to the subject

3111.52 --> 3114.319
stick to the level that we were talking

3113.44 --> 3115.52
about

3114.319 --> 3116.72
don't

3115.52 --> 3119.7599999999998
let

3116.72 --> 3122.0789999999997
the garbage feeders

3119.76 --> 3124.7200000000003
pull your focus away

3122.079 --> 3127.6800000000003
because we are in a high level energy

3124.72 --> 3128.8799999999997
shown right now and this demon piece of

3127.68 --> 3131.44
[ __ ]

3128.88 --> 3134.48
is trying to unravel that he wants us

3131.44 --> 3136.7200000000003
back in the dirt back in the mud where

3134.48 --> 3139.599
he's crawling like a crab in a bucket

3136.72 --> 3142.5589999999997
he's trying to pull us down

3139.599 --> 3142.559
don't be a crab

3149.28 --> 3153.2000000000003
right so

3150.839 --> 3154.96
anymore reflections on what i was

3153.2 --> 3157.4399999999996
talking about

3154.96 --> 3160.16
comparison

3157.44 --> 3161.76
like even the gods of the pantheon of

3160.16 --> 3165.2
olds

3161.76 --> 3167.6800000000003
they were part of a created expectation

3165.2 --> 3169.2799999999997
right and so are the men in black and

3167.68 --> 3173.24
the aliens now

3169.28 --> 3173.2400000000002
they're part of an expectation

3180.32 --> 3188.2000000000003
[Music]

3183.76 --> 3188.2000000000003
that the creator no wait

3195.76 --> 3200.46
that's an interesting statement rest

3197.76 --> 3202.1600000000003
ahead it's very hard to pin down

3200.46 --> 3203.839
[Music]

3202.16 --> 3206.0
would you agree that the creator is in

3203.839 --> 3208.4
no way shape or necessarily if so affect

3206.0 --> 3210.64
the so-called god god in any specific

3208.4 --> 3214.48
religion

3210.64 --> 3214.48
that's a tricky one i can't tell

3214.8 --> 3219.3590000000004
that it could be

3217.52 --> 3221.119
it could be

3219.359 --> 3223.2
but not fully

3221.119 --> 3227.76
you see

3223.2 --> 3230.96
god is not in this realm

3227.76 --> 3234.0
he never will be

3230.96 --> 3238.2400000000002
he never has had a

3234.0 --> 3238.24
avatar that is him

3238.96 --> 3242.079
you see never

3242.4 --> 3249.04
like we all life all creation is

3246.8 --> 3251.44
partially the avatar

3249.04 --> 3254.0
but it's always partially

3251.44 --> 3257.76
so even if any

3254.0 --> 3260.559
sensible religion is worshipping a god

3257.76 --> 3263.6800000000003
what it will reveal is the knowledge of

3260.559 --> 3266.3190000000004
creation itself the rules of creation of

3263.68 --> 3268.3999999999996
god arguably who might be

3266.319 --> 3269.44
represented in a personification in

3268.4 --> 3272.079
order to

3269.44 --> 3274.4
verbally share that knowledge

3272.079 --> 3276.0
but it's simply discovered knowledge of

3274.4 --> 3279.28
the design

3276.0 --> 3281.44
right that doesn't mean that those gods

3279.28 --> 3284.88
as they are represented in the religion

3281.44 --> 3285.839
are literally the creator

3284.88 --> 3289.119
that's

3285.839 --> 3291.64
not true it isn't it's impossible

3289.119 --> 3293.839
it's a personified god or

3291.64 --> 3296.0789999999997
self-created god look it up in

3293.839 --> 3300.0789999999997
symbolics.now

3296.079 --> 3303.079
made an entire paragraph about that

3300.079 --> 3303.079
self-created

3305.74 --> 3311.7599999999998
[Music]

3308.24 --> 3314.9599999999996
right that doesn't mean that there is no

3311.76 --> 3318.96
ultimate designer and it doesn't mean

3314.96 --> 3321.76
that a religion is even that far off

3318.96 --> 3324.4
it just means that people can't even

3321.76 --> 3326.88
freaking imagine the designer without

3324.4 --> 3329.359
some kind of personification

3326.88 --> 3331.359
they can't focus

3329.359 --> 3334.4
people just can't focus if they could

3331.359 --> 3337.04
they would be highly enlightened

3334.4 --> 3339.44
they wouldn't need any religion

3337.04 --> 3341.04
and people that do don't need any

3339.44 --> 3345.04
religion

3341.04 --> 3347.599
it's it's right there in plain sight

3345.04 --> 3348.799
religions have personifications of the

3347.599 --> 3351.28
designer

3348.799 --> 3352.4
which automatically makes it not the

3351.28 --> 3355.76
designer

3352.4 --> 3358.1600000000003
simply a conduit an in-between form that

3355.76 --> 3360.0
helps people focus

3358.16 --> 3363.839
because without it they just don't

3360.0 --> 3363.839
understand anything about it

3364.96 --> 3368.7200000000003
so

3365.839 --> 3368.72
yes and no

3370.88 --> 3374.559
gods of religions are not necessarily

3373.44 --> 3377.839
fake

3374.559 --> 3377.8390000000004
but they have been

3378.24 --> 3384.9599999999996
put down represented shaped

3381.839 --> 3388.0
within the imagination by people in

3384.96 --> 3391.839
order to be able to be understood

3388.0 --> 3391.839
by the simpler of mind

3395.76 --> 3400.7990000000004
i hope that answers your question rest

3398.48 --> 3400.799
ahead

3401.76 --> 3405.8390000000004
hey yeah liz good to see you

3437.68 --> 3441.359
no but

3438.799 --> 3444.0
godzilla that's a straw man rasta had

3441.359 --> 3447.0
was obviously not talking about atheist

3444.0 --> 3447.0
religion

3452.319 --> 3458.319
not all religions despite when you

3454.96 --> 3459.599
google it not all religions worship a

3458.319 --> 3463.2
deity

3459.599 --> 3467.599
most [ __ ] definition ever

3463.2 --> 3467.5989999999997
like blatantly made by atheists

3468.16 --> 3473.7599999999998
like the reason that exists that idea oh

3471.92 --> 3475.04
religions are about worshiping a

3473.76 --> 3477.0400000000004
deutsche

3475.04 --> 3477.92
yeah who the [ __ ] you think came up with

3477.04 --> 3481.92
that

3477.92 --> 3484.079
atheism to hide that they are a freaking

3481.92 --> 3486.64
religion

3484.079 --> 3489.92
why else

3486.64 --> 3492.48
it cannot have been another way

3489.92 --> 3494.2400000000002
that's the reason it is there

3492.48 --> 3495.28
because atheists

3494.24 --> 3496.3999999999996
just

3495.28 --> 3499.2000000000003
want

3496.4 --> 3502.0
their religion without recognition that

3499.2 --> 3503.5989999999997
it is a religion so they straw man oh if

3502.0 --> 3506.319
you have a god that means you're a

3503.599 --> 3506.319
religion then

3512.4 --> 3516.88
yes gorzilla

3514.799 --> 3518.72
i'm a little fired up don't don't take

3516.88 --> 3522.6400000000003
it too personal

3518.72 --> 3522.64
just got a whole troll wave and [ __ ]

3523.2 --> 3528.16
and i am extremely passionate about this

3525.44 --> 3529.76
subject so i look

3528.16 --> 3531.5989999999997
if you're going to be halfway funny

3529.76 --> 3534.2400000000002
about something that's really serious

3531.599 --> 3536.7200000000003
don't don't be outraged if i'm gonna

3534.24 --> 3539.72
yell at you okay it's just the way i do

3536.72 --> 3539.72
it

3542.63 --> 3545.829
[Music]

3555.359 --> 3562.0
yeah rest dad i i agree

3559.2 --> 3562.0
hello rob h

3563.839 --> 3567.2
that's right

3565.44 --> 3569.52
you got it

3567.2 --> 3571.72
right why do you think that in

3569.52 --> 3574.88
and i'm bringing it up again

3571.72 --> 3576.16
symbolics.nl cosmology

3574.88 --> 3580.88
that there's not

3576.16 --> 3582.96
god the almighty creator no it's the one

3580.88 --> 3584.319
and it's specific

3582.96 --> 3587.92
like

3584.319 --> 3590.16
you don't know anything about it you

3587.92 --> 3592.48
never will

3590.16 --> 3595.7599999999998
unless you are with it

3592.48 --> 3597.2
which is not during life

3595.76 --> 3599.44
that's it

3597.2 --> 3603.7599999999998
that's it

3599.44 --> 3603.76
look it up symbolic starting l

3604.16 --> 3607.68
yeah got the history of the world in the

3605.839 --> 3609.839
dimensions linked up earlier now i'm

3607.68 --> 3612.839
gonna link up symbolics i don't know

3609.839 --> 3616.4
like these are like serious

3612.839 --> 3618.0789999999997
scriptures not like holy scriptures my

3616.4 --> 3620.0
scriptures

3618.079 --> 3621.599
made throughout time

3620.0 --> 3624.16
and they matter

3621.599 --> 3626.7200000000003
all of them do

3624.16 --> 3629.1189999999997
i'm building upon the knowledge of what

3626.72 --> 3632.52
i figured out during that time still to

3629.119 --> 3632.52
this day

3651.68 --> 3656.319
you're passionate about this subject too

3653.92 --> 3659.04
well you can talk about it you're not

3656.319 --> 3660.64
gonna get yourself banned just don't be

3659.04 --> 3664.079
an ass

3660.64 --> 3668.319
all right reserved i'm the show owner

3664.079 --> 3668.319
i'm passionate i can yell at you

3668.559 --> 3673.6800000000003
don't yell back i know that's

3670.96 --> 3676.88
asymmetrical right oh it's not fair

3673.68 --> 3679.2
but why can't i do exactly the same

3676.88 --> 3680.799
thing as you are when in your chat yeah

3679.2 --> 3683.04
that's because you're not the one

3680.799 --> 3686.559
running the show you're not the channel

3683.04 --> 3689.599
owner i reserve the right

3686.559 --> 3691.92
it's going to be asymmetrical

3689.599 --> 3694.4
i'm like within the social hierarchy of

3691.92 --> 3697.119
this event i am going to be placed above

3694.4 --> 3699.599
you and you have to accept that

3697.119 --> 3701.839
if you're gonna rebel against that

3699.599 --> 3704.559
that specifically you're gonna get

3701.839 --> 3706.48
kicked out eventually

3704.559 --> 3708.4
that's the way it is

3706.48 --> 3712.2400000000002
you can be passionate about something

3708.4 --> 3716.2400000000002
just realize you don't have the right

3712.24 --> 3716.24
to start yelling at me

3716.4 --> 3720.2400000000002
that result that right is reserved for

3718.72 --> 3722.799
me

3720.24 --> 3722.799
in the show

3723.44 --> 3732.16
but don't be afraid to share your ideas

3727.76 --> 3734.48
share your ideas let them be tested

3732.16 --> 3735.52
but face the outcome

3734.48 --> 3739.48
that's all

3735.52 --> 3739.48
just have to face it

3743.21 --> 3746.389
[Music]

3750.24 --> 3754.9599999999996
oops

3752.48 --> 3758.319
i linked up the wrong page

3754.96 --> 3758.319
it was in the dutch version

3762.559 --> 3767.1600000000003
yep i have it in dutch and english

3773.28 --> 3777.599
all right

3775.039 --> 3780.3190000000004
i'm glad that i did that i translated

3777.599 --> 3783.319
all that stuff

3780.319 --> 3783.319
like

3785.92 --> 3789.839
like 15 years ago or something

3790.64 --> 3794.8799999999997
in english

3792.96 --> 3796.88
because i knew that it was going to be

3794.88 --> 3799.28
important

3796.88 --> 3800.319
i knew back then when i made that site

3799.28 --> 3802.079
like

3800.319 --> 3805.92
nobody's gonna get this for like a

3802.079 --> 3807.6800000000003
decade i knew it i knew that and

3805.92 --> 3809.44
everybody i showed it was always gonna

3807.68 --> 3811.2799999999997
be it was always like

3809.44 --> 3813.359
whoa

3811.28 --> 3814.6400000000003
like no matter who they are like oh oh

3813.359 --> 3816.64
you're like a

3814.64 --> 3818.16
50 year old that studied like a whole

3816.64 --> 3820.319
bunch of book and

3818.16 --> 3822.0
books and stuff and like

3820.319 --> 3825.0389999999998
the important books

3822.0 --> 3827.359
they're still gonna be whoa

3825.039 --> 3830.079
right especially if you realize that i

3827.359 --> 3832.0
haven't read all those books

3830.079 --> 3834.799
like the only book at that time that

3832.0 --> 3839.839
i've even read voluntarily was freaking

3834.799 --> 3839.839
lord of the rings that's it

3840.55 --> 3843.699
[Music]

3844.079 --> 3849.76
right i knew that nobody was gonna get

3846.64 --> 3851.44
it in a way i enjoyed it because it felt

3849.76 --> 3854.079
make me made me feel like i was a

3851.44 --> 3857.599
special boy because i oh i understand

3854.079 --> 3860.2400000000002
things that nobody gets but they will i

3857.599 --> 3862.88
knew that they will and i knew that i

3860.24 --> 3866.359
would get more of it too

3862.88 --> 3866.359
and i have

3871.119 --> 3874.119
hmm

3887.92 --> 3892.96
yeah rest dad i know you're a very

3890.319 --> 3895.359
passionate guy so you have similar

3892.96 --> 3898.0
tendencies

3895.359 --> 3898.0
as i do

3902.16 --> 3908.96
you can get very fired up i get it

3906.24 --> 3910.3999999999996
you're doing a lot better by the way

3908.96 --> 3914.079
if

3910.4 --> 3914.079
if you care to hear that but

3914.559 --> 3917.28
i think you do

3917.44 --> 3922.079
you seem just generally much more in

3919.76 --> 3925.559
control of yourself

3922.079 --> 3925.559
and that's great

3939.2 --> 3943.52
all right just realize and you probably

3941.119 --> 3944.96
do rest ahead that

3943.52 --> 3946.96
i too

3944.96 --> 3948.079
i have memories of you being more out of

3946.96 --> 3950.7200000000003
control

3948.079 --> 3953.2000000000003
and i have kind of taken it upon myself

3950.72 --> 3955.5989999999997
is on my show to be very straightforward

3953.2 --> 3957.4399999999996
so sometimes i might slightly misread

3955.599 --> 3959.44
something you're saying

3957.44 --> 3961.76
and then interpret it

3959.44 --> 3965.2000000000003
as if it's the old you

3961.76 --> 3966.88
go at you and then find out oh [ __ ] you

3965.2 --> 3969.4399999999996
actually didn't say it like that i

3966.88 --> 3970.96
misread it so that happens too this

3969.44 --> 3973.039
happened a couple of times over the

3970.96 --> 3975.599
years

3973.039 --> 3978.559
i think you know that as well

3975.599 --> 3980.6400000000003
is it's very tough for two smart and

3978.559 --> 3982.88
very passionate people to keep getting

3980.64 --> 3983.92
along it always will be it's never gonna

3982.88 --> 3986.4
get

3983.92 --> 3989.52
a lot easier

3986.4 --> 3989.52
just a little

3990.839 --> 3994.24
easier ah

4001.92 --> 4007.039
yes hysterical

4004.72 --> 4010.0389999999998
never listen to a convincing argument

4007.039 --> 4010.039
indeed

4029.039 --> 4032.88
yeah clutch

4030.319 --> 4035.44
well look it even happens still with me

4032.88 --> 4037.839
over at the flat earth debates

4035.44 --> 4040.16
and it is kind of annoying it's like

4037.839 --> 4042.799
when i'm super pumped

4040.16 --> 4046.64
to bring down put down an argument like

4042.799 --> 4046.64
perfectly like a little icon

4046.96 --> 4053.119
because it's like yeah i am like a 10

4050.48 --> 4055.76
times speed higher level routine it's

4053.119 --> 4058.0
like it's like a glyph like magic

4055.76 --> 4061.119
appears to me and i really need to say

4058.0 --> 4064.48
it and then everybody on fvd subtly

4061.119 --> 4066.48
decided oh now it's time to get funny

4064.48 --> 4068.559
and i'm like dude shut up stop

4066.48 --> 4070.48
interrupting me i'm trying to focus here

4068.559 --> 4073.44
and then they're like oh come on orwen

4070.48 --> 4076.0
don't be like that dude shut up

4073.44 --> 4079.599
just let me [ __ ] say the thing

4076.0 --> 4079.599
without interruption

4080.24 --> 4084.64
they always do that now not always but a

4082.96 --> 4086.4
lot of the times they do it's so

4084.64 --> 4087.44
annoying

4086.4 --> 4089.359
like

4087.44 --> 4092.4
it doesn't help

4089.359 --> 4094.24
to tell you oh just calm down what oh so

4092.4 --> 4096.88
you're already going to assume that i'm

4094.24 --> 4099.92
just exaggerating and didn't have a

4096.88 --> 4101.4400000000005
super important point which is why i got

4099.92 --> 4103.759
so riled up

4101.44 --> 4105.3589999999995
that's very poor

4103.759 --> 4108.08
human insight

4105.359 --> 4108.08
on your part

4109.839 --> 4115.359
hey one for the unit good see you

4112.13 --> 4115.359
[Music]

4117.12 --> 4119.839
what the

4128.08 --> 4130.88
what the hell

4131.44 --> 4137.2789999999995
a gyro compass acquires north with

4134.96 --> 4139.759
outward

4137.279 --> 4143.319
i have no idea what you're talking about

4139.759 --> 4143.319
one for the unit

4151.04 --> 4154.04
what

4160.48 --> 4166.08
i i don't necessarily even understand

4163.04 --> 4168.4
like i've heard of gyro compasses but i

4166.08 --> 4170.96
don't know what they do

4168.4 --> 4173.599999999999
exactly mechanically

4170.96 --> 4175.359
i mean without rotation well then it

4173.6 --> 4177.52
would have to be a ring laser-based

4175.359 --> 4179.679
gyroscope

4177.52 --> 4182.080000000001
i don't know how would it require

4179.679 --> 4184.0
acquire north

4182.08 --> 4186.48
how does it do that i don't know if it's

4184.0 --> 4188.96
not doing it magnetically i i don't know

4186.48 --> 4188.959999999999
i'm not

4189.679 --> 4193.359
i don't know the fine details

4192.319 --> 4194.96
of how

4193.359 --> 4198.400000000001
this

4194.96 --> 4198.4
gyro compass would work

4198.56 --> 4202.56
ring laser jar yes ring laser gyro

4200.96 --> 4204.8
because it does it's a gyroscope that

4202.56 --> 4207.120000000001
doesn't have moving parts it's just

4204.8 --> 4207.12
light

4213.12 --> 4217.84
that giant oh my goodness

4215.199 --> 4221.678999999999
i don't even know how any

4217.84 --> 4223.92
gyro would be used to acquire north

4221.679 --> 4226.08
i mean you would have to know where

4223.92 --> 4228.56
north is

4226.08 --> 4230.88
in order to have any set up that once

4228.56 --> 4233.76
you got a gyrospun up

4230.88 --> 4236.8
that you will use its rigidity within

4233.76 --> 4239.360000000001
euclidean space in order to be able to

4236.8 --> 4240.88
pinpoint exactly where this north would

4239.36 --> 4242.32
be

4240.88 --> 4245.64
so

4242.32 --> 4245.639999999999
i don't know

4250.48 --> 4254.48
bring laserjet

4252.159 --> 4254.48
okay

4255.28 --> 4260.08
i was just responding to the inquiry

4258.08 --> 4261.92
here you said

4260.08 --> 4264.5599999999995
gyrocompass

4261.92 --> 4267.76
acquiring north without rotation well if

4264.56 --> 4271.4400000000005
it can't rotate then it can only be a

4267.76 --> 4271.4400000000005
ring laser-based gyroscope

4271.76 --> 4276.719
i don't know what else you're talking

4273.6 --> 4276.719
about then otherwise

4279.37 --> 4286.12
[Music]

4282.56 --> 4286.120000000001
oh gain wisdom

4308.56 --> 4315.2390000000005
all right so one for the unit i

4310.8 --> 4315.2390000000005
hope that helps somewhat

4349.76 --> 4352.0
whoa

4352.48 --> 4358.799999999999
oh man

4354.88 --> 4358.8
concentrated that's so intense

4364.48 --> 4368.718999999999
i'm really liking this asapinka

4369.36 --> 4372.92
it's good stuff

4373.25 --> 4376.439
[Music]

4383.34 --> 4388.159000000001
[Music]

4386.159 --> 4391.36
and i mean like this a pink that could

4388.159 --> 4393.04
work like great if you dilute it a lot

4391.36 --> 4395.839999999999
then it's still great it would be like

4393.04 --> 4399.44
this light lemonade-ish

4395.84 --> 4401.52
taste on just water if you cool it off

4399.44 --> 4403.678999999999
like this drink is excellent if you like

4401.52 --> 4405.92
it concentrated or if you like it super

4403.679 --> 4408.08
diluted

4405.92 --> 4409.76
i really recommend this

4408.08 --> 4412.719
it's great

4409.76 --> 4415.679
it's a bit pricey but dude you can do a

4412.719 --> 4415.679
long time with it

4424.4 --> 4431.48
i'll come back when i have a solution

4427.52 --> 4431.4800000000005
okay one for the unit

4450.51 --> 4453.6990000000005
[Music]

4481.84 --> 4483.92
you

4510.88 --> 4514.8
wow

4512.32 --> 4517.199
yeah i'm looking up this gyro compass

4514.8 --> 4519.92
like that story is like the biggest

4517.199 --> 4523.12
piece of horseshit i've ever heard of

4519.92 --> 4525.84
that's a direct globe machination

4523.12 --> 4525.84
direct

4526.0 --> 4531.04
like it's complete [ __ ] because

4527.76 --> 4533.04
there is no [ __ ] axis of spinning

4531.04 --> 4534.48
ball earth to attune to it makes no

4533.04 --> 4536.719
[ __ ] sense

4534.48 --> 4539.839999999999
like the entire thing makes no bloody

4536.719 --> 4539.84
damn sense

4541.12 --> 4546.4
the whole point about a freaking

4543.12 --> 4548.32
gyroscope is that it would

4546.4 --> 4550.879999999999
attune

4548.32 --> 4552.4
to the freaking spinning ball earth to

4550.88 --> 4554.88
its axis

4552.4 --> 4557.5199999999995
and they don't

4554.88 --> 4560.52
so this entire thing is just complete

4557.52 --> 4560.52
horseshit

4593.6 --> 4599.4400000000005
that's hilarious

4596.88 --> 4602.719
it's a hilarious dude i'm gonna share

4599.44 --> 4602.719
this this is special

4603.28 --> 4608.44
this is

4604.56 --> 4608.4400000000005
[ __ ] hilarious

4608.56 --> 4613.679
i just looked up

4610.199 --> 4615.78
gyrocompass on wikipedia

4613.679 --> 4618.08
well guess what i found here

4615.78 --> 4620.639999999999
[Music]

4618.08 --> 4620.64
hold on

4621.04 --> 4623.84
jesus

4624.239 --> 4630.48
oh yes that's such an optimal way to

4627.04 --> 4633.5199999999995
divide the screen yes

4630.48 --> 4634.718999999999
because we need that sidebar so much

4633.52 --> 4637.360000000001
just this

4634.719 --> 4638.4800000000005
void space on the side we need it so

4637.36 --> 4641.12
much

4638.48 --> 4644.08
thanks for not letting me able to scroll

4641.12 --> 4644.88
away from that that's great

4644.08 --> 4647.199
uh

4644.88 --> 4647.1990000000005
right

4647.92 --> 4652.4800000000005
general scope not to be confused with

4650.4 --> 4655.04
the gyrocompass spinning wheel mounted

4652.48 --> 4658.08
on a set of gimbals so that its access

4655.04 --> 4661.679
is free to orient itself in any way

4658.08 --> 4663.36
when it is fun up to speed with the axis

4661.679 --> 4666.0
pointing in some direction due to the

4663.36 --> 4667.92
law of conservation of angular momentum

4666.0 --> 4669.679
such wheel

4667.92 --> 4672.56
will normally maintain its original

4669.679 --> 4675.12
orientation fixed to the out in point in

4672.56 --> 4675.92
outer space not to a fixed point on

4675.12 --> 4678.4
earth

4675.92 --> 4681.1990000000005
since the earth rotates

4678.4 --> 4682.08
it appears a stationary observer on

4681.199 --> 4685.28
earth

4682.08 --> 4688.48
that a gyroscope's axis is completing a

4685.28 --> 4691.48
full rotation once every 24 hours

4688.48 --> 4691.48
already

4692.88 --> 4695.92
i don't think so

4698.4 --> 4702.08
such a rotation

4700.48 --> 4704.159
rotating gyroscope is used for

4702.08 --> 4707.04
navigation in some cases for example

4704.159 --> 4710.08
aircraft

4707.04 --> 4712.64
heading indicator direction but cannot

4710.08 --> 4715.679
ordinarily be used long-term

4712.64 --> 4717.04
marine navigation

4715.679 --> 4719.12
the crucial

4717.04 --> 4722.48
additional ingredients needed to turn a

4719.12 --> 4724.8
gyroscope into a gyrocompass

4722.48 --> 4727.12
so it would automatically position to

4724.8 --> 4727.84
true north

4727.12 --> 4730.719
is

4727.84 --> 4733.52
some mechanical mechanism that results

4730.719 --> 4736.56
in application of torque

4733.52 --> 4738.88
whenever the compass axis is not

4736.56 --> 4738.88
what

4742.0 --> 4746.84
but it's it makes no sense though

4748.0 --> 4751.199
like

4748.8 --> 4753.92
how would that even like how are you

4751.199 --> 4758.159
going to have

4753.92 --> 4758.159
the axis point north

4758.32 --> 4763.84
perfectly without

4760.84 --> 4765.52
magnetism and then keep it there as you

4763.84 --> 4768.96
move

4765.52 --> 4773.4400000000005
how would it stick to that

4768.96 --> 4778.08
unless north is a uniform direction

4773.44 --> 4780.239
which is the only way a rigid spinning

4778.08 --> 4782.96
gyroscope would

4780.239 --> 4785.44
well be able to keep pointing at exactly

4782.96 --> 4787.04
the same direction in it being that

4785.44 --> 4789.759999999999
direction

4787.04 --> 4791.199
like if the north was a point on a disc

4789.76 --> 4794.159000000001
or a ball

4791.199 --> 4796.719
it couldn't work

4794.159 --> 4799.92
now how about that

4796.719 --> 4803.92
it wouldn't be able to work

4799.92 --> 4806.4800000000005
if the north was a point on a disc

4803.92 --> 4810.32
or a ball

4806.48 --> 4810.32
how are you gonna force

4810.48 --> 4815.04
with some thingy

4812.639 --> 4817.76
some torque mechanism how are you going

4815.04 --> 4819.28
to make it keep pointing north that

4817.76 --> 4824.159000000001
makes no sense

4819.28 --> 4824.159
this entire thing is a giant machination

4827.04 --> 4830.84
i might bring this up at fed this is

4829.36 --> 4833.44
pretty

4830.84 --> 4835.92
interesting but it's

4833.44 --> 4838.5599999999995
like what they tell here is absolute

4835.92 --> 4838.56
horseshit

4839.76 --> 4845.159000000001
pretty incredible

4842.159 --> 4845.159
anyway

4855.44 --> 4860.678999999999
of course you know it doesn't make sense

4857.28 --> 4860.679
on a ball

4860.719 --> 4866.88
the gyro compass by its description

4863.04 --> 4867.84
makes no mechanical sense on a disc or a

4866.88 --> 4870.639
ball

4867.84 --> 4873.52
it would work perfectly on a rectangular

4870.639 --> 4876.88
looping platter though

4873.52 --> 4878.2390000000005
huh because in a rectangular looping

4876.88 --> 4880.96
flat earth

4878.239 --> 4882.638999999999
north is a euclidean

4880.96 --> 4884.639
uniform

4882.639 --> 4886.0
direction

4884.639 --> 4887.84
huh

4886.0 --> 4890.239
oh you hadn't thought about that because

4887.84 --> 4893.12
you were stuck in your little false

4890.239 --> 4895.759999999999
dichotomy defletter's disc oh that's the

4893.12 --> 4896.5599999999995
only flat earth is the flutter disc oh

4895.76 --> 4898.159000000001
no

4896.56 --> 4899.120000000001
no it's not

4898.159 --> 4901.28
huh

4899.12 --> 4903.5199999999995
bet you didn't think about that one did

4901.28 --> 4903.5199999999995
you

4914.96 --> 4919.679
now it's not going to be the year of

4916.8 --> 4921.92
your [ __ ] little gyroscope compass

4919.679 --> 4925.92
nonsense story yeah justice is never

4921.92 --> 4929.679
going to be the year of globiolus actual

4925.92 --> 4930.4
deviation claims which are [ __ ]

4929.679 --> 4933.12
right

4930.4 --> 4936.159
so is the wiki entry

4933.12 --> 4939.12
about this device

4936.159 --> 4943.04
it's a complete lie

4939.12 --> 4946.32
all gyroscopes on a spinning ball earth

4943.04 --> 4948.96
would always not just process every 24

4946.32 --> 4950.32
hours it would process azure moving over

4948.96 --> 4953.04
the earth

4950.32 --> 4953.04
they don't

4953.12 --> 4960.0
because the earth isn't a spinning ball

4956.719 --> 4962.32
they actually stay quite rigid

4960.0 --> 4965.12
in euclidean space

4962.32 --> 4968.639
at all time

4965.12 --> 4969.92
gyroscopes don't go and drift

4968.639 --> 4971.6
yeah

4969.92 --> 4973.6
because the earth supposedly

4971.6 --> 4977.04
pre-supposedly is a spinning ball

4973.6 --> 4980.719
underneath it they don't drift yeah we

4977.04 --> 4983.28
had that stupid little thanks bob

4980.719 --> 4984.639
15 degrees an hour with a ring laser

4983.28 --> 4987.44
gyroscope

4984.639 --> 4989.6
and it's not even like confirmed that

4987.44 --> 4992.719
that always happens with ring laser

4989.6 --> 4996.2390000000005
gyroscopes that could simply be

4992.719 --> 4997.92
a a piece of faulty equipment

4996.239 --> 5001.36
right

4997.92 --> 5003.36
literally can be just that

5001.36 --> 5005.599999999999
i mean we're not finding out is anybody

5003.36 --> 5007.44
else testing ring laser gyroscopes is

5005.6 --> 5010.0
this universal only ring laser

5007.44 --> 5011.12
gyroscopes they all drift 15 degrees per

5010.0 --> 5012.96
hour

5011.12 --> 5015.76
or they don't

5012.96 --> 5019.44
is just at one time because the

5015.76 --> 5022.08
equipment wasn't used properly

5019.44 --> 5024.638999999999
because i definitely know

5022.08 --> 5026.159
with quite a lot of certainty 100

5024.639 --> 5030.719
percent

5026.159 --> 5031.599999999999
that mechanical gyroscopes don't drift

5030.719 --> 5033.679
huh

5031.6 --> 5035.76
not even back then

5033.679 --> 5038.4800000000005
they don't drift

5035.76 --> 5042.0
now if the earth was a spinning ball

5038.48 --> 5044.32
they would drift always

5042.0 --> 5046.0
just like there would be coriolis

5044.32 --> 5048.159
deviation because the earth would be

5046.0 --> 5050.56
spinning underneath

5048.159 --> 5052.5599999999995
the air

5050.56 --> 5054.719
and flight times

5052.56 --> 5057.120000000001
would differ

5054.719 --> 5060.0
because things up there

5057.12 --> 5061.92
would not be attached to the rotating

5060.0 --> 5064.08
reference frame

5061.92 --> 5065.76
the spinning bow earth

5064.08 --> 5067.44
but that doesn't happen

5065.76 --> 5070.56
flight times are pretty consistent

5067.44 --> 5072.96
whether they are eastward or westward

5070.56 --> 5075.6
because the earth isn't a spinning ball

5072.96 --> 5079.639
just like mechanical gyroscopes don't

5075.6 --> 5079.639
drift over time

5086.0 --> 5091.92

i will suit myself

5134.32 --> 5139.44

the earth is not a [ __ ] spinning ball

re-assert that it is true even though

it's provably not true

5182.72 --> 5186.719
[Music]

5185.04 --> 5187.6
bye

5186.719 --> 5190.159
you

5187.6 --> 5193.56
don't let the door hit you in the ass on

5190.159 --> 5193.5599999999995
the way out

5236.0 --> 5242.08
so did anybody even listen

5238.96 --> 5245.52
not a rectangular looping model but

5242.08 --> 5248.239
nobody likes that one so that's the

5245.52 --> 5250.159000000001
least real one because nobody likes it

5248.239 --> 5252.0
yeah because you're all [ __ ] and you

5250.159 --> 5253.92
suck the devil's dick with your

5252.0 --> 5256.4
ignorance

5253.92 --> 5257.92
yeah i already said oh there's a

5256.4 --> 5260.5599999999995
gyroscope

5257.92 --> 5262.8
it points at true north

5260.56 --> 5265.280000000001
without magnetism

5262.8 --> 5268.320000000001
well you go explain to me

5265.28 --> 5270.4
how that works

5268.32 --> 5273.04
how does that work

5270.4 --> 5273.92
i can think of only one way that could

5273.04 --> 5278.32
work

5273.92 --> 5279.4400000000005
and that is if the north was a absolute

5278.32 --> 5282.44
rigid

5279.44 --> 5282.44
orientation

5282.719 --> 5288.8
within a euclidean space

5286.4 --> 5290.719
the north always that direction not a

5288.8 --> 5292.8
point on the map

5290.719 --> 5294.4
not a point

5292.8 --> 5295.52
one direction

5294.4 --> 5297.759999999999
right

5295.52 --> 5300.080000000001
there that could be if

5297.76 --> 5301.84
if north is a direction and it's

5300.08 --> 5303.5199999999995
universal

5301.84 --> 5306.159000000001
yeah

5303.52 --> 5308.96
then i can imagine our gyroscope which

5306.159 --> 5312.799999999999
is always the same orientation in

5308.96 --> 5316.08
euclidean space could be made to always

5312.8 --> 5318.2390000000005
point absolute north without a magnet

5316.08 --> 5323.44
the only way i could even think of that

5318.239 --> 5326.718999999999
working is if the north was a universal

5323.44 --> 5329.199
direction in euclidean space

5326.719 --> 5330.719
so there you go

5329.199 --> 5333.599999999999
yeah

5330.719 --> 5339.96
gyrus compass gyrocompass

5333.6 --> 5339.96
proof of a rectangular looping realm

[Music]

5391.199 --> 5394.5599999999995
what elysee hello

5393.36 --> 5397.04
what

5394.56 --> 5399.679
are you in agreeance with me

5397.04 --> 5399.679
what do you think

5399.84 --> 5404.88
is the gyrocompass

5401.92 --> 5407.76
like actual tangible what is not

5404.88 --> 5410.56
scientific what is proof

5407.76 --> 5412.56
that north is an absolute direction and

5410.56 --> 5415.1990000000005
therefore the realm has to be

5412.56 --> 5416.96
rectangular looping and not

5415.199 --> 5420.0
a disk

5416.96 --> 5422.4
in which the north is a point in the

5420.0 --> 5422.4
middle

5424.08 --> 5427.48
what do you think

5445.66 --> 5448.8589999999995
[Music]

5451.04 --> 5455.12
ah i'm gonna take a bit of a breather

5455.28 --> 5458.32
getting hot

5456.719 --> 5461.639
it's getting cooler actually but it just

5458.32 --> 5461.639
needed breathing

5474.56 --> 5477.56
oh

5477.679 --> 5480.4800000000005
okay

5478.96 --> 5483.28
so far it's been a pretty damn

5480.48 --> 5483.28
impressive show

5484.0 --> 5487.84
had some spirit mechanics a lot of

5485.92 --> 5490.08
yelling

5487.84 --> 5492.56
some troll bashing and even some flat

5490.08 --> 5496.159
earth mechanics leading to rectangular

5492.56 --> 5496.159000000001
looping flat earth how about that

5499.04 --> 5506.96
you said a rectangular looping what

5502.159 --> 5508.48
flat earth rectangular looping flat

5506.96 --> 5511.84
earth

5508.48 --> 5517.48
and the rectangular looping flat earth

5511.84 --> 5517.4800000000005
north is a universal direction

5521.12 --> 5524.4
rectangular looks

5524.56 --> 5529.92
so funny oh

5526.639 --> 5533.84
yes yes it's not working though

5529.92 --> 5533.84
[ __ ] not huh

5568.4 --> 5571.679
yeah

5569.6 --> 5572.84
see

5571.679 --> 5577.36
welcome to

5572.84 --> 5580.8
a pretty close close attempt to

5577.36 --> 5582.48
give a euclidean accurate representation

5580.8 --> 5585.52
it's an attempt it's not perfect but

5582.48 --> 5588.799999999999
it's there it's in the direction

5585.52 --> 5592.56
and yeah guess where north is

5588.8 --> 5593.84
i'd say that a gyro compass on this map

5592.56 --> 5594.88
would be

5593.84 --> 5596.159000000001
pointing

5594.88 --> 5599.36
north

5596.159 --> 5601.28
on every exact location it would be

5599.36 --> 5603.679
the north pointing would be parallel

5601.28 --> 5605.679
everywhere at all times

5603.679 --> 5606.56
and that works great

5605.679 --> 5607.679

the earth no it's just going to point

5613.6 --> 5617.84
uniformly in the same direction

5617.92 --> 5624.56
no matter how the vehicle turns

5622.239 --> 5628.678999999999

you're there to uphold the lies

5705.52 --> 5711.6
for them to distract everybody else with

5708.719 --> 5714.8
so they can proceed to rob and

5711.6 --> 5717.679

5714.8 --> 5720.0
the least amount of interference huh

5717.679 --> 5721.84

5825.119 --> 5829.679
face exactly

5826.639 --> 5831.119
the reason why they lied mostly to

5829.679 --> 5833.76
themselves

5831.119 --> 5836.48
oh you think you can defend

5833.76 --> 5839.84

5836.48 --> 5841.199

there will be no oh funny trolls today

5858.639 --> 5863.28
talking about very serious subjects

5862.32 --> 5865.28
that are

5863.28 --> 5867.199
difficult and require a measure of

5865.28 --> 5870.96
concentration

5867.199 --> 5872.879999999999
so trolls will be kicked out and treated

5870.96 --> 5875.44
brutally

5872.88 --> 5879.04
they will not be left in so everybody

5875.44 --> 5881.839999999999
has this easy extra seduction so they

5879.04 --> 5884.48

5881.84 --> 5886.4800000000005
serious subject yeah you do

5884.48 --> 5888.239

today

5953.199 --> 5958.759999999999

5985.36 --> 5990.5599999999995
everything i could

5987.679 --> 5992.32
and hey if there was deeper inquiry on a

5990.56 --> 5993.1990000000005
higher level to the things that i've

5992.32 --> 5995.28
said

5993.199 --> 5997.599999999999
then i would have had more

5995.28 --> 6001.04
room to dig in

5997.6 --> 6004.159000000001
i guess that everybody had plenty

6001.04 --> 6004.159
