but there's a lot of moist in the air

122.96 --> 126.88
and

124.719 --> 129.84
it's cold i think it's kind of water

126.88 --> 129.84

162.08 --> 167.36

164.4 --> 169.20000000000002
viewing angle situation going

167.36 --> 171.20000000000002
and with the other one if i would watch

169.2 --> 173.92
from too low everything would start to

171.2 --> 178.23899999999998
blur like start to discolor

173.92 --> 178.23899999999998

despite me being sick i was able to

286.24 --> 291.84000000000003

291.84 --> 296.56
taking a long walk

is

489.599 --> 492.8
six degrees

491.52 --> 494.479
with a lot of

492.8 --> 497.479
humidity and

494.479 --> 497.479
precipitation

497.84 --> 500.87899999999996
over 90 percent

503.199 --> 507.72
right

504.16 --> 507.72
ah yeah

511.599 --> 517.2
i'm a little late today

514.88 --> 519.919
because yeah i did sleep pretty long

517.2 --> 522.24
yeah because of the four hours sleeping

519.919 --> 525.279
in the afternoon yesterday

522.24 --> 527.279
like i did stay up a little bit later

525.279 --> 528.8
but in a good way this time not really

527.279 --> 532.399
nervous

528.8 --> 532.399
so i had a good sleep and

536.32 --> 538.9590000000001
and i'm back

539.519 --> 545.04
uh mr sensible refuses to concede after

543.04 --> 548.56
last night yeah yeah oh there were still

545.04 --> 550.56
plenty of streams out there and i have

548.56 --> 552.399
watched them i did completely miss the

550.56 --> 554.4799999999999
fed

552.399 --> 557.519
friday show including after show though

554.48 --> 562.04
because i slept through it all

557.519 --> 562.04
but yeah beside that

562.88 --> 568.56
there was flat side with a stream

565.92 --> 571.8389999999999
or with a couple of video uploads

568.56 --> 571.8389999999999
mitchell was live with

571.92 --> 577.8389999999999
with flat side on it and that was great

574.16 --> 577.8389999999999
very triggering for the trolls again

580.32 --> 585.279
and yeah mr sensible's gonna get a

582.48 --> 587.76
spanking or he is getting his spanking

585.279 --> 590.72
because he is just doubling down on

587.76 --> 592.399
delusion

590.72 --> 595.12
and so are a whole bunch of other

592.399 --> 596.959
anti-flat earthers but mr sensible is

595.12 --> 599.68
like really

596.959 --> 602.2399999999999
trying to be on point with it

599.68 --> 606.079
this reduc ridiculous gas lighting

602.24 --> 606.0790000000001
situation concerning the sexton

606.16 --> 608.959

608.079 --> 611.3599999999999

614.64 --> 619.8389999999999
stream from jim bob

616.56 --> 619.8389999999999
it was awesome

621.92 --> 626.24
uh

622.959 --> 626.2399999999999
yeah that was pretty much it

628.32 --> 633.36

from thursday and

633.36 --> 636.64

i might not be just at 400 strength just

672.56 --> 675.5189999999999
yet

674.48 --> 677.6
but

675.519 --> 680.64
i'm not going to get sick today i'm

677.6 --> 680.64
pretty sure about that

686.0 --> 689.839
hey nathan oakley good to see you

697.12 --> 701.839
yesterday i was i was just i broke

699.76 --> 704.48
pretty

701.839 --> 707.44
but today i'm

704.48 --> 707.44
mostly fixed

710.56 --> 716.3199999999999

gonna be covered for at least the next

726.16 --> 729.36
week

727.12 --> 731.6
and maybe more i'm not entirely sure i'd

729.36 --> 733.76
like a whole bunch of donations started

731.6 --> 735.0400000000001
to pile on yesterday

733.76 --> 737.279
so

735.04 --> 739.4399999999999
yeah i'm actually in a pretty good mood

737.279 --> 739.4399999999999
and

742.839 --> 746.8800000000001
yeah

744.8 --> 749.92
and that's all thanks to you yeah all of

746.88 --> 752.56
you guys donating and spreading the word

749.92 --> 756.16
and just your supporting

752.56 --> 758.399
attitude has also been very helpful

756.16 --> 761.04
it really is especially like

758.399 --> 764.56
when i feel really bad

761.04 --> 766.8
then like seeing that you actually

764.56 --> 769.4399999999999
even just want to support

766.8 --> 771.4399999999999
that you're empathized that's

769.44 --> 772.72
like that helps a lot actually when i'm

771.44 --> 774.8800000000001
like that

772.72 --> 776.48
it doesn't really fix it but it's like

774.88 --> 779.6
really

776.48 --> 779.6
whatever you call that uh

782.0 --> 785.399
you say that

786.16 --> 790.3199999999999
it's like

787.2 --> 794.48
ensuring it's like it it just

790.32 --> 794.48
yeah it's a very ensuring feeling

797.839 --> 804.0400000000001
and by the way thank you that vlad

799.36 --> 804.04
fellow for the 99 cents super chat

816.88 --> 819.519
right and

820.079 --> 824.6389999999999
yeah there's all kinds of things that

821.92 --> 824.639
have yeah

824.8 --> 829.8389999999999
i made like work of it because of the

827.04 --> 829.8389999999999
panic situation

831.36 --> 836.399
and there might be actually some upturns

834.959 --> 839.04
might be

836.399 --> 843.199
like i finally got the the

839.04 --> 846.0
the crypto situation from my uh gti

843.199 --> 848.4799999999999
thing which is kind of messy and it's

846.0 --> 851.6
been yeah sort of at least seemingly

848.48 --> 854.0
unreliable and weird elusive

851.6 --> 855.12
if there might finally be some kind of a

854.0 --> 856.88
result

855.12 --> 859.199
moving out of that somehow because it

856.88 --> 861.199
got really all frozen up and things

859.199 --> 863.8389999999999
didn't connect anymore and

861.199 --> 865.279
didn't understand why so even that is

863.839 --> 868.0
moving

865.279 --> 871.12
we'll see what happens no guarantees but

868.0 --> 874.32
at least they got moving again right

871.12 --> 874.32
uh hey matthew hall

876.399 --> 882.36
gadget inspector

878.959 --> 882.3599999999999
daniel robles

892.639 --> 896.9590000000001
yeah there's no more dislike button

894.24 --> 899.519
that's right youtube removed it

896.959 --> 901.5189999999999
last week

899.519 --> 904.079
and

901.519 --> 906.72
yeah i also did get some new subscribers

904.079 --> 909.12
i think it's probably because of uh

906.72 --> 913.639
the night owl show i did

909.12 --> 913.639
that hits another audience and

915.519 --> 919.68
that damn it

917.519 --> 919.68
keep

921.519 --> 925.5600000000001
yeah it's also because of

927.68 --> 931.519
rob durham

929.12 --> 933.759
i think because rob durham has been

931.519 --> 935.44
around for a long time i think that i

933.759 --> 938.0790000000001
might have gotten

1078.32 --> 1081.32
look

1083.679 --> 1087.2800000000002
i i don't wanna

1085.6 --> 1090.3999999999999
spend like

1087.28 --> 1093.12
my live show talking about suggestions

1090.4 --> 1094.48
for me to get a job

1093.12 --> 1095.1999999999998
really

1094.48 --> 1097.679
but

1095.2 --> 1098.559
your advice has been noted and it will

1097.679 --> 1100.88
be

1098.559 --> 1102.6399999999999
on my mind when i start figuring out

1100.88 --> 1104.4
what i'm gonna do

1102.64 --> 1106.16
next to the show

1104.4 --> 1109.16
if i'm gonna do something next to the

1106.16 --> 1109.16
show

1112.08 --> 1115.84
that was perfect pronunciation yeah and

1114.32 --> 1118.24
i know how to

1115.84 --> 1118.24
do that

1121.28 --> 1125.039
yeah yeah that's like hey but

1123.44 --> 1127.44
to be fair

1125.039 --> 1129.44
yesterday i said i would be much better

1127.44 --> 1131.679
today

1129.44 --> 1133.919
i wasn't like

1131.679 --> 1135.6000000000001
like super sick and

1133.919 --> 1139.039
that i knew like i'm gonna need a week

1135.6 --> 1141.6
to recover it was just very acute

1139.039 --> 1142.4
stress related not like

1141.6 --> 1144.9599999999998
yeah

1142.4 --> 1146.3200000000002
alcohol related of some sort

1144.96 --> 1148.24
so

1146.32 --> 1150.08
yeah i just had to get the stress out of

1148.24 --> 1151.6
my system

1150.08 --> 1154.72
that's it

1151.6 --> 1157.28
and that worked also because well the

1154.72 --> 1159.44
the fundraiser was a success right which

1157.28 --> 1162.08
was kind of the trigger cause

1159.44 --> 1165.559
for the sort of nervous breakdown that i

1162.08 --> 1165.559
basically underwent

1166.4 --> 1171.0800000000002
so yeah i'm much better today

1185.12 --> 1188.1599999999999
also easter's the time and temporary

1187.2 --> 1192.559
staff

1188.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
okay well david look i'll think about it

1192.559 --> 1197.799
like it might

1193.84 --> 1197.799
might be doable

1206.0 --> 1210.32
after heart digs work i feel great yeah

1215.36 --> 1218.84
i know

1217.36 --> 1220.7199999999998
have you tried

1218.84 --> 1223.1999999999998
fiverr

1220.72 --> 1226.08
i have actually tried fiverr a bit i

1223.2 --> 1227.76
offered my services for as a as a dutch

1226.08 --> 1229.039
to english and english to dutch

1227.76 --> 1231.84
translator

1229.039 --> 1233.44
i've never got a single response to that

1231.84 --> 1235.12
like

1233.44 --> 1238.88
but

1235.12 --> 1238.8799999999999
yeah i know about fiverr

1244.72 --> 1248.44
hey service day

1260.96 --> 1269.039
youtube's new monetization policy sucks

1266.24 --> 1271.28
discrimination

1269.039 --> 1271.28
okay

1275.12 --> 1280.3999999999999
i i i'm not

1276.799 --> 1280.4
having too much issues with it

1281.52 --> 1285.679
and neither are people like jim bob so

1288.72 --> 1292.4
i don't know it

1290.96 --> 1295.039
i wonder like

1292.4 --> 1298.72
how is the crackdown from youtube really

1295.039 --> 1298.72
happening like how does that work

1298.799 --> 1301.12
because

1301.28 --> 1304.3999999999999
my channel is still here and hey i've

1303.76 --> 1308.72
been

1304.4 --> 1308.72
kind of known to talk about anything

1310.08 --> 1315.12
except for like details of really really

1313.36 --> 1316.799
dark stuff because

1315.12 --> 1318.6399999999999
i

1316.799 --> 1320.72
do not like doing that

1318.64 --> 1324.159
so i rarely do that

1320.72 --> 1324.159
right but one of the things that

1324.48 --> 1329.6
that i think is an influence

1327.36 --> 1330.84
of why they're not going after me is be

1329.6 --> 1335.1999999999998
because i

1330.84 --> 1337.4399999999998
am like strategically depolarizing

1335.2 --> 1339.44
with all the information out there

1337.44 --> 1341.3600000000001
that's kind of one of my objectives to

1339.44 --> 1343.039
depolarize

1341.36 --> 1346.6399999999999
and that's like on all kinds of fronts

1343.039 --> 1348.4
and so that means that if some new hype

1346.64 --> 1350.4
happened right

1348.4 --> 1352.799
if you down start like oh my god check

1350.4 --> 1353.6000000000001
this out this is incredible then that

1352.799 --> 1356.72
like

1353.6 --> 1359.1999999999998
that starts like a little fire

1356.72 --> 1360.88
that makes everybody go all hyped up and

1359.2 --> 1363.1200000000001
that's the sort of thing that youtube

1360.88 --> 1365.1200000000001
cracks down on that's when they don't

1363.12 --> 1367.76
like it

1365.12 --> 1369.6
but you seem to be able to just address

1367.76 --> 1371.039
things calmly

1369.6 --> 1376.1589999999999
if you don't

1371.039 --> 1376.1589999999999
if you prevent that hyping up effect

1377.6 --> 1384.08
if you kind of stay more low profile-ish

1381.2 --> 1385.52
in that sense emotionally you know that

1384.08 --> 1386.8799999999999
so

1385.52 --> 1388.799
yeah it

1386.88 --> 1390.24
like how does

1388.799 --> 1394.08
the whole

1390.24 --> 1394.08
banning policy really work

1397.2 --> 1401.679
it's not just oh you address the subject

1399.919 --> 1405.1200000000001
that means you're banned it just doesn't

1401.679 --> 1405.1200000000001
seem to work like that at all

1405.76 --> 1411.52
so it's more of a

1407.76 --> 1413.84
issue how do you address it

1411.52 --> 1415.84
you want to draw in the big crouch you

1413.84 --> 1419.28
like oh let's hype it up let's get it

1415.84 --> 1422.72
all in there yeah they don't like that

1419.28 --> 1426.24
they don't like the wildfires

1422.72 --> 1426.24
but you can address things

1427.919 --> 1433.3600000000001
not gonna go out to work come over

1430.48 --> 1434.4
all right all right

1433.36 --> 1438.32
what

1434.4 --> 1438.3200000000002
you almost burned down your house jesus

1440.08 --> 1442.32
oh

1443.12 --> 1447.039
damn

1445.2 --> 1450.159
water damage on the battery of your

1447.039 --> 1452.799
e-bike that sucks i hope it still works

1450.159 --> 1454.0800000000002
man okay dude take care of it we already

1452.799 --> 1457.76
talked about it

1454.08 --> 1460.1589999999999
there is no like real super urgency now

1457.76 --> 1461.919
because my financial situation at least

1460.159 --> 1465.0390000000002
is already covered

1461.919 --> 1467.279
and i can still go out for groceries

1465.039 --> 1467.279
so

1468.4 --> 1472.64
maybe see you monday like as we

1470.4 --> 1475.2
discussed

1472.64 --> 1477.3600000000001
if things are fixed back already because

1475.2 --> 1479.44
yeah don't

1477.36 --> 1482.0
if you you don't have a functioning bike

1479.44 --> 1484.0
then yeah i'm not expecting you to

1482.0 --> 1487.159
walk all the way here from the east of

1484.0 --> 1487.159
my country

1488.08 --> 1490.6399999999999
all right all right

1489.679 --> 1493.44
anyway

1490.64 --> 1497.279
yeah surface day and me had a

1493.44 --> 1497.279
skype call yesterday night

1499.6 --> 1503.039
all right all right no problem

1503.6 --> 1507.48
i'll just see you on monday

1517.919 --> 1523.039
yeah service day i i know i started out

1521.2 --> 1524.72
saying oh i just want a short

1523.039 --> 1528.799
conversation had like a half hour in

1524.72 --> 1528.799
mind and then it turned into two hours

1531.76 --> 1535.12
it was a good chat indeed

1537.52 --> 1542.24
also a good test to basically talk about

1540.32 --> 1543.279
a lot of the things i talk about in

1542.24 --> 1545.1200000000001
dutch

1543.279 --> 1548.0
because i don't have many opportunities

1545.12 --> 1548.0
to do that

1548.4 --> 1554.0
i have to like quickly

1550.799 --> 1554.0
reverse engineer

1554.4 --> 1557.6000000000001
my

1555.279 --> 1559.76
use of words

1557.6 --> 1562.32
which i'm used to basically formulating

1559.76 --> 1562.32
in english

1563.76 --> 1567.52
so i didn't get a lot of practice for

1565.279 --> 1567.52
that

1567.679 --> 1570.679
anyway

1590.64 --> 1595.6000000000001
youtube wants it family friendly for

1592.799 --> 1598.6
people with smart tvs since

1595.6 --> 1598.6
okay

1599.2 --> 1603.44
right yeah that there's that

1603.679 --> 1610.76
no i don't know i'm not like exactly

1606.799 --> 1610.76
super family friendly

1612.159 --> 1616.3200000000002
but i don't know maybe i am i'm just

1614.08 --> 1616.32
like

1616.88 --> 1619.5200000000002
i'm very open

1618.48 --> 1622.96
and

1619.52 --> 1624.84
i don't like pretend like i'm always

1622.96 --> 1627.2
just perfect

1624.84 --> 1630.6399999999999
right because

1627.2 --> 1632.48
many people on youtube do that they just

1630.64 --> 1636.72
they want to show their good side and

1632.48 --> 1639.44
they just never show anything else

1636.72 --> 1642.559
like they only show that side i kind of

1639.44 --> 1642.559
show all my sides

1647.6 --> 1654.9189999999999
but yeah try to

1650.399 --> 1654.9189999999999
avoid letting the bad things linger

1666.0 --> 1670.32
they will just shut down all small

1668.08 --> 1674.279
streamers after a probation what are you

1670.32 --> 1674.279
talking about david hall

1682.799 --> 1688.559
no longer monetization for channels that

1685.84 --> 1690.799
discuss promote conspiracy

1688.559 --> 1692.8799999999999
okay well i wonder like how far that

1690.799 --> 1695.36
will go i mean

1692.88 --> 1699.919
yeah channels that are like exclusively

1695.36 --> 1699.9189999999999
about medical conspiracy situation

1700.08 --> 1705.4399999999998
i kind of get it like i don't like it

1702.88 --> 1708.3200000000002
but i understand how that works but i i

1705.44 --> 1712.3200000000002
don't know if i'll be targeted because i

1708.32 --> 1712.32
don't just constantly talk about that

1712.96 --> 1717.039
i'm not like a dedicated channel that

1715.279 --> 1717.76
expects to be

1717.039 --> 1719.36
like

1717.76 --> 1721.52
to be found

1719.36 --> 1722.8799999999999
when looking for that specific subject

1721.52 --> 1724.72
and i think that's what they're trying

1722.88 --> 1728.0
to

1724.72 --> 1728.0
create obstacles for

1728.159 --> 1734.0
i haven't seen ray twin for a long time

1731.76 --> 1736.96
uh

1734.0 --> 1739.6
well sometimes he still comes out i

1736.96 --> 1741.8400000000001
don't do it on here anymore

1739.6 --> 1741.84
but

1742.399 --> 1748.4799999999998
like i still get a bit rage when he

1746.399 --> 1750.799
like on fed sometimes

1748.48 --> 1755.3990000000001
when the like the moods are not good and

1750.799 --> 1755.399
all that it's it's still there

1767.12 --> 1771.4799999999998
what are you talking about david hall

1781.679 --> 1786.0800000000002
demanding 18 updates was up to you guys

1784.88 --> 1789.0390000000002
inspector

1786.08 --> 1790.08
i haven't done any update for

1789.039 --> 1791.679
at least

1790.08 --> 1792.559
a year

1791.679 --> 1795.2
more

1792.559 --> 1796.8799999999999
also because certain updates like oh do

1795.2 --> 1798.159
this update and then i do it like oh

1796.88 --> 1800.24
yeah it didn't work

1798.159 --> 1802.5590000000002
like oh that's just great but it still

1800.24 --> 1803.919
keeps out like do it like yeah but it

1802.559 --> 1805.44
doesn't work

1803.919 --> 1806.88
and there's no

1805.44 --> 1808.48
newer updates but that might have

1806.88 --> 1810.64
something to do that i

1808.48 --> 1814.32
am running windows 7

1810.64 --> 1817.279
still and works just fine

1814.32 --> 1818.72
like it's working great like it is

1817.279 --> 1822.679
working great

1818.72 --> 1822.679
no problems with it

1831.6 --> 1834.6
uh

1855.039 --> 1862.36
are you march of protesters

1857.279 --> 1862.36
huh no i haven't seen any hint of that

1869.12 --> 1874.9599999999998
near my place where where near my place

1872.559 --> 1878.08
are like gonna move like past the street

1874.96 --> 1880.24
it is a tip this street over there is

1878.08 --> 1883.1999999999998
the typical street that that are used

1880.24 --> 1885.36
for marches and parades

1883.2 --> 1886.799
so like if it's like a

1885.36 --> 1889.12
gateway

1886.799 --> 1892.1589999999999
it always comes past there

1889.12 --> 1894.399
but maybe protest roots also use it i

1892.159 --> 1894.3990000000001
don't know

1901.36 --> 1906.399
people are using youtube app on a smart

1904.08 --> 1908.559
tv never get to see smaller channels

1906.399 --> 1910.399
really

1908.559 --> 1913.039
not even if they

1910.399 --> 1914.8799999999999
search for them

1913.039 --> 1916.8799999999999
i mean they won't get it in the

1914.88 --> 1920.679
recommendations david oh i would

1916.88 --> 1920.679
understand that but

1927.12 --> 1932.8799999999999
can pinpoint okay fine service day

1930.72 --> 1935.919
right so there might be a pro like a

1932.88 --> 1937.6000000000001
protest march here or something

1935.919 --> 1940.6000000000001
i'll keep a lookout when i go out for

1937.6 --> 1940.6
groceries

1949.44 --> 1952.559
hey dan the water man

1955.2 --> 1959.64
are you the guy that sent me the email

1965.12 --> 1970.6399999999999
i've settled down a lot yeah yeah well

1967.12 --> 1973.1999999999998
it's not like ray twin is much more

1970.64 --> 1973.2
contained

1975.6 --> 1979.6789999999999
also because i basically managed to fix

1978.88 --> 1982.0
fix

1979.679 --> 1983.44
a lot of misunderstandings

1982.0 --> 1987.6
for myself

1983.44 --> 1987.6000000000001
like i just got my bearings more

1988.24 --> 1992.32
right because it in the beginning when i

1990.399 --> 1994.799
kind of just came on youtube

1992.32 --> 1997.76
i keep trying to explain i was like

1994.799 --> 1999.12
heavily burdened

1997.76 --> 2002.48
with

1999.12 --> 2005.6789999999999
memories of my visions and all that

2002.48 --> 2009.2
and not understanding it like really not

2005.679 --> 2010.88
understanding it and that was like scary

2009.2 --> 2013.1200000000001
and

2010.88 --> 2016.24
weird and freaky

2013.12 --> 2017.5189999999998
and that also kind of

2016.24 --> 2021.1200000000001
just

2017.519 --> 2023.919
made me get overloaded

2021.12 --> 2025.9189999999999
but yeah in the what is it six years now

2023.919 --> 2029.8400000000001
that i've been on youtube i've like

2025.919 --> 2032.64
managed to understand what that big

2029.84 --> 2034.6399999999999
vision actually is

2032.64 --> 2036.24
and that it's real that it's not just

2034.64 --> 2040.0800000000002
something that

2036.24 --> 2044.559
seems like a cohesive thing etc etc and

2040.08 --> 2047.6
just i'm not afraid anymore of like

2044.559 --> 2049.839
certain things that

2047.6 --> 2052.24
i was experienced while going through it

2049.839 --> 2055.04
i managed to basically separate the

2052.24 --> 2055.04
experience

2055.2 --> 2058.1589999999997
from

2056.159 --> 2060.32
my current state

2058.159 --> 2062.8
while back then i would just have like

2060.32 --> 2065.119
flashbacks and then go through it again

2062.8 --> 2067.44
and feel it again and that was not

2065.119 --> 2069.76
pleasant

2067.44 --> 2071.359
right so i would be like i was yesterday

2069.76 --> 2072.2400000000002
morning

2071.359 --> 2075.7599999999998
like

2072.24 --> 2079.2
kind of shaky and i would be like that

2075.76 --> 2081.9190000000003
for a lot longer periods of time

2079.2 --> 2083.919
and not super intense like the first day

2081.919 --> 2086.1589999999997
but i would like stay like that for a

2083.919 --> 2089.2
very long time kind of weird and shaky

2086.159 --> 2092.0
and nervous and that typically

2089.2 --> 2094.0789999999997
would then trigger me opening up a can

2092.0 --> 2096.32
of rage win

2094.079 --> 2098.6400000000003
so i'm just not

2096.32 --> 2100.7200000000003
in that state

2098.64 --> 2103.44
anymore because i managed to fix it and

2100.72 --> 2104.56
i'm really happy about it

2103.44 --> 2107.44
like i

2104.56 --> 2110.0789999999997
yeah it was scary because it just felt

2107.44 --> 2110.079
like i was

2110.32 --> 2113.52
something that's out of control and i

2112.8 --> 2115.04
like

2113.52 --> 2117.04
i just had this feeling like this is

2115.04 --> 2120.079
going to end really badly

2117.04 --> 2120.079
and i don't know how

2120.96 --> 2128.0
ominous is the word i'm looking for

2124.56 --> 2130.24
but yeah i don't feel like that anymore

2128.0 --> 2132.24
i mean the world is still somewhat

2130.24 --> 2134.7999999999997
ominous in ways

2132.24 --> 2138.24
but now i understand how

2134.8 --> 2141.28
because yeah like including 10 years ago

2138.24 --> 2142.56
i had through the dark world hints

2141.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
of this

2142.56 --> 2145.839
medical tyranny

2146.4 --> 2152.1600000000003
also through alex jones

2149.28 --> 2154.48
but also through dark world things

2152.16 --> 2156.48
point yeah that it was pointed at like

2154.48 --> 2159.839
look at this

2156.48 --> 2159.839
yeah we're gonna do that

2161.28 --> 2166.7200000000003
and now it's happening and now i know

2163.04 --> 2166.72
how it is happening because i

2167.44 --> 2172.079
didn't yet understand that the operation

2169.839 --> 2173.839
was kind of purely psychological i

2172.079 --> 2175.44
thought it was going to be much more

2173.839 --> 2176.96
overt

2175.44 --> 2179.28
like really

2176.96 --> 2181.359
bringing in like the foot soldiers with

2179.28 --> 2183.6800000000003
forced vaccinations i thought that was

2181.359 --> 2188.16
actually going to physically happen

2183.68 --> 2188.16
but it seems more overall suggestive

2189.2 --> 2194.16
although yeah

2190.96 --> 2196.88
some places it's getting like it's it's

2194.16 --> 2198.72
almost getting like that

2196.88 --> 2200.56
scary

2198.72 --> 2203.04
but not over here

2200.56 --> 2204.56
and hopefully that'll stay that way

2203.04 --> 2208.72
right

2204.56 --> 2209.92
i suggest water purif i already have it

2208.72 --> 2213.72
oh wait

2209.92 --> 2213.7200000000003
water filter service

2216.8 --> 2221.2000000000003
david hall hey

2218.56 --> 2223.04
i stop

2221.2 --> 2226.7599999999998
i already told you i don't want to talk

2223.04 --> 2226.7599999999998
about work

2231.76 --> 2235.6800000000003
lifestyle stuff yeah but that's not

2233.28 --> 2238.96
gonna work i i'm not gonna do like

2235.68 --> 2240.8799999999997
another youtube project

2238.96 --> 2243.359
separate

2240.88 --> 2245.359
from what i do

2243.359 --> 2247.7599999999998
that's not gonna work

2245.359 --> 2250.56
like it might work but it it will be

2247.76 --> 2252.48
disruptive to me in the long run

2250.56 --> 2255.92
because i will get like

2252.48 --> 2257.92
literal pull like oh just just let go of

2255.92 --> 2260.7200000000003
that flat earth you know you you can be

2257.92 --> 2263.04
so big all you need to do is just let go

2260.72 --> 2264.48
of that last little thing that's what

2263.04 --> 2267.52
all gonna that's what's gonna happen

2264.48 --> 2270.56
that's why i don't even wanna go there

2267.52 --> 2273.52
you see

2270.56 --> 2274.72
like i don't i already got ballers doing

2273.52 --> 2276.0

with comments and [ __ ]

2278.48 --> 2285.76
like a lot

2279.839 --> 2287.04

it's awesome

2439.359 --> 2444.56
a free word program yeah libreoffice is

2442.4 --> 2447.04
very i've been using libreoffice i've

2444.56 --> 2449.359
i'm using libreoffice

2447.04 --> 2450.56
or i used it

2449.359 --> 2451.7599999999998
to make

2450.56 --> 2453.68
my uh

2451.76 --> 2455.8390000000004
my dnd book

2453.68 --> 2458.64
the thousand pages

2455.839 --> 2461.52
i did that all in libreoffice yeah i i

2458.64 --> 2464.7599999999998
don't use word

2461.52 --> 2464.7599999999998
it's annoying

2471.92 --> 2476.8
also open yeah but libreoffice is like

2474.079 --> 2478.319
the follow-up of an open office

2476.8 --> 2481.8390000000004
it is basically

2478.319 --> 2481.839
become libreoffice

2487.839 --> 2492.48
a huge storm now

2489.68 --> 2494.319
internet not great oh what else is new

2492.48 --> 2497.76
flat side

2494.319 --> 2499.119
now wait it was mostly

2497.76 --> 2502.8
um

2499.119 --> 2505.44
mitchell's internet wasn't it yesterday

2502.8 --> 2508.44
it was giving out during during your

2505.44 --> 2508.44
show

2515.2 --> 2523.839
600 pound bonus wow that's awesome dude

2519.92 --> 2523.839
glad to hear that tony whitcomb

2528.4 --> 2532.2000000000003
hey pj crew shank

2539.839 --> 2545.319
last night mitchell

2541.599 --> 2545.319
now yours right

2551.119 --> 2555.599
right so by the way also i've been

2553.28 --> 2558.5600000000004
thinking some more

2555.599 --> 2560.0
about well rob durham's case

2558.56 --> 2562.319
with the circles

2560.0 --> 2565.44
on the map and how it turned into tear

2562.319 --> 2567.599
drops on the glow projection

2565.44 --> 2569.599
like i didn't at first get it i was like

2567.599 --> 2571.52
okay but why would you try to do that

2569.599 --> 2573.04
process

2571.52 --> 2575.7599999999998
on that map

2573.04 --> 2578.4
but apparently it really is the default

2575.76 --> 2582.8
map in which that process is used which

2578.4 --> 2582.8
is kind of like pretty weird in a way

2584.64 --> 2589.359
like it's kind of weird because does

2586.319 --> 2591.2799999999997
that then actually mean rob durham also

2589.359 --> 2592.7999999999997
kind of suggested during the night i'll

2591.28 --> 2594.6400000000003
show like

2592.8 --> 2597.599
does that mean it's actually like

2594.64 --> 2599.5989999999997
rectangular looping like

2597.599 --> 2603.28
is it actually

2599.599 --> 2603.28
a rectangle then

2605.119 --> 2610.8
if that is the default thing

2607.76 --> 2614.5600000000004
that is used for the

2610.8 --> 2617.119
for the circles of equal altitude

2614.56 --> 2620.92
measurements and all that

2617.119 --> 2620.92
because that would be

2621.119 --> 2623.92
like

2622.88 --> 2627.2000000000003
quite

2623.92 --> 2630.7200000000003
a piece of solid evidence if that thing

2627.2 --> 2633.2799999999997
is used per default

2630.72 --> 2636.72
for like field measurements to be the

2633.28 --> 2636.7200000000003
most accurate that's

2637.599 --> 2642.88
like i didn't even see it at first but

2639.839 --> 2644.7999999999997
if that is true then

2642.88 --> 2646.839
we could that kind of means that the

2644.8 --> 2648.7200000000003
rectangular map is

2646.839 --> 2651.92
the

2648.72 --> 2654.0789999999997
the most cartesian one

2651.92 --> 2657.359
the most

2654.079 --> 2659.3590000000004
basically to scale

2657.359 --> 2661.119
where everything is equally to scale and

2659.359 --> 2663.04
that's

2661.119 --> 2666.48
quite mind-blowing

2663.04 --> 2666.48
if that is completely true

2673.76 --> 2677.8390000000004
also makes you wonder like

2680.64 --> 2682.8799999999997
like

2683.52 --> 2687.92
what is there at the north is it really

2685.68 --> 2687.9199999999996
just

2688.839 --> 2692.64
pretend see

2690.64 --> 2695.359
where they say let's just see icecap

2692.64 --> 2698.0789999999997
stuff is that really there or is there

2695.359 --> 2701.2
more because if the rectangular map is

2698.079 --> 2704.319
used as a default then there is

2701.2 --> 2707.4399999999996
either a barrier there or there is just

2704.319 --> 2709.04
more room somehow

2707.44 --> 2713.16
that is just not

2709.04 --> 2713.16
shown in the globe projection

2719.92 --> 2724.359
hello elise g good to see you

2739.04 --> 2742.04
so

2759.359 --> 2767.48
yeah yeah i got to inspect yeah optic

2761.92 --> 2767.48
fiber cable is incredibly fast

2780.079 --> 2783.079
hmm

2798.319 --> 2802.079
ah okay lsg

2800.16 --> 2804.96
presentation the other day was cool you

2802.079 --> 2807.599
you mean rob durham's video

2804.96 --> 2809.68
he had some question about east west

2807.599 --> 2811.52
circumnavigation

2809.68 --> 2816.44
all right well ask away

2811.52 --> 2816.44
i have been addressing this so

2825.04 --> 2829.119
it's kind of weird you know because the

2826.64 --> 2832.319
rectangular map

2829.119 --> 2834.4
well you want to present it without like

2832.319 --> 2835.2799999999997
just a overt loop

2834.4 --> 2837.839
in it

2835.28 --> 2840.7200000000003
then it's like a scroll

2837.839 --> 2842.88
it's just a scroll

2840.72 --> 2845.839
and we don't know what's there north and

2842.88 --> 2845.839
south

2859.92 --> 2862.2400000000002
what

2862.8 --> 2865.28
okay

2863.839 --> 2868.7999999999997
flat side

2865.28 --> 2868.8
i'm not seeing that on my side

2869.359 --> 2873.839
man it's cold by the way damn

2904.4 --> 2908.92
right so lg asked your question

2928.319 --> 2932.96
most of the internet cables and this

2930.559 --> 2936.96
well jeff gas said yeah

2932.96 --> 2941.359
it's because there were fiber optics

2936.96 --> 2942.48
being installed in the 90s a lot

2941.359 --> 2945.2799999999997
and

2942.48 --> 2947.839
starting out at the 80s i think

2945.28 --> 2950.079
because at first it was just used for

2947.839 --> 2952.24
terminal internet

2950.079 --> 2954.2400000000002
terminals

2952.24 --> 2957.2799999999997
it's only later that it became kind of

2954.24 --> 2958.9599999999996
adapted to also be using the telephone

2957.28 --> 2961.3590000000004
lines and all that

2958.96 --> 2965.68
but at first it was kind of like yeah

2961.359 --> 2965.68
cables for terminal networks

2966.96 --> 2970.96
and then later in the 90s it like oh you

2969.2 --> 2973.68
could also have like call-in modems and

2970.96 --> 2976.64
that used telephone systems

2973.68 --> 2977.68
just like the facts

2976.64 --> 2980.24
but yeah

2977.68 --> 2983.5589999999997
fiber optic cables have been around for

2980.24 --> 2983.5589999999997
for a while

2986.48 --> 2990.4
and they work incredibly efficient

2993.76 --> 3000.92
their excuse it's cheaper yeah it is

2996.24 --> 3000.9199999999996
it is cheaper and it works

3016.079 --> 3020.6400000000003
there's a picture during fe show

3018.64 --> 3025.8799999999997
it shows what i assume to be magnetic

3020.64 --> 3025.8799999999997
north with blue and red teardrop shapes

3026.96 --> 3030.4
no

3028.16 --> 3030.3999999999996
what

3030.8 --> 3034.079
maybe

3031.839 --> 3035.44
i don't know

3034.079 --> 3038.559
but the whole

3035.44 --> 3040.2400000000002
circle of equal altitude teardrop system

3038.559 --> 3042.8
is what happens when you use the

3040.24 --> 3044.0
standard rectangular map

3042.8 --> 3045.28
and then

3044.0 --> 3047.2
after you

3045.28 --> 3048.48
subjected it to the circle of equal

3047.2 --> 3051.52
altitude

3048.48 --> 3053.52
process then you fold the thing around

3051.52 --> 3054.88
the globe and then it turns into the

3053.52 --> 3057.839
teardrops

3054.88 --> 3059.92
because it reveals just how

3057.839 --> 3062.5589999999997
how that globe

3059.92 --> 3064.8
projection state is created from the

3062.559 --> 3067.0400000000004
rectangular map that's what it's

3064.8 --> 3068.559
revealing

3067.04 --> 3071.359
i don't know about the other video

3068.559 --> 3073.76
you're talking about

3071.359 --> 3076.24
because this particular case had nothing

3073.76 --> 3079.119
to do with the magnetics

3076.24 --> 3082.0789999999997
but it might be a similar effect i mean

3079.119 --> 3084.6400000000003
any like it basically reveals a

3082.079 --> 3086.7200000000003
geometric aspect

3084.64 --> 3090.4
so any kind of circle including a

3086.72 --> 3090.3999999999996
magnetic circle or whatever

3090.72 --> 3094.16
that you

3091.76 --> 3096.6400000000003
lay out on the rectangular map when you

3094.16 --> 3098.48
put that into a glow projection it will

3096.64 --> 3101.359
do the same thing

3098.48 --> 3105.44
because it's about how the projection

3101.359 --> 3105.44
works and folds it all together

3105.599 --> 3111.76
resulting circles on the rectangular map

3109.68 --> 3114.8799999999997
to become tear-shaped

3111.76 --> 3114.88
that is kind of the

3123.28 --> 3123.28
all point

3140.96 --> 3146.44
so i hope that kind of answers your

3142.64 --> 3146.44
question elise g

3168.319 --> 3172.64
30 nautical miles a day with the cable

3170.96 --> 3174.559
yeah

3172.64 --> 3176.16
that like

3174.559 --> 3177.6800000000003
well gadget spectre yeah i'm not

3176.16 --> 3179.2799999999997
surprised and

3177.68 --> 3181.839
it should happen

3179.28 --> 3181.8390000000004
in my opinion

3182.8 --> 3187.28
cables all over the place so we don't

3185.68 --> 3190.64
have to do [ __ ]

3187.28 --> 3190.6400000000003
wireless like that

3190.72 --> 3194.2
it's not good

3194.8 --> 3202.079
i've like even 20 years ago i've i

3197.76 --> 3204.8
envisioned like yeah cable it up

3202.079 --> 3206.88
cable it all up cables everywhere

3204.8 --> 3209.8390000000004
and then it'll be about

3206.88 --> 3212.079
internet cable security

3209.839 --> 3215.44
right because it would eventually lead

3212.079 --> 3217.119
like a full-on standardized system using

3215.44 --> 3218.16
cables everywhere

3217.119 --> 3220.559
will

3218.16 --> 3223.5589999999997
kind of make the cables become a target

3220.559 --> 3223.559
too

3223.76 --> 3229.2000000000003
like for disruption operations so

3227.44 --> 3231.04
yeah

3229.2 --> 3233.52
my this might

3231.04 --> 3237.7599999999998
kind of think a bit sci-fi-ish

3233.52 --> 3240.24
this might turn into like a giant

3237.76 --> 3242.3190000000004
set of cables that's that are going

3240.24 --> 3244.0789999999997
around the entire world like internet

3242.319 --> 3246.0
cables everywhere

3244.079 --> 3248.4
and it'll have its own

3246.0 --> 3251.839
designated security force to make sure

3248.4 --> 3253.839
that nobody tampers with the wiring

3251.839 --> 3257.52
it might become its own

3253.839 --> 3257.52
corporate entity even like that

3257.839 --> 3260.96
i don't know

3259.44 --> 3263.359
it all depends on how things are going

3260.96 --> 3265.76
to enroll

3263.359 --> 3269.839
pun intended

3265.76 --> 3269.8390000000004
as in cable rolling out

3275.839 --> 3281.2
dude we might have like if they wanted

3279.119 --> 3282.799
they could literally roll out the cable

3281.2 --> 3284.72
to

3282.799 --> 3285.839
the lens beyond antarctica if they

3284.72 --> 3287.5989999999997
wanted to

3285.839 --> 3289.04
at this time

3287.599 --> 3291.52
like they could do that they could

3289.04 --> 3293.2799999999997
literally just lay the cable right over

3291.52 --> 3296.559
the giant ice sheets

3293.28 --> 3297.8390000000004
it have to be a thick dam cable

3296.559 --> 3300.2400000000002
right

3297.839 --> 3301.359
but since it's mostly just light

3300.24 --> 3303.839
activity

3301.359 --> 3306.72
it's not going to be really influenced

3303.839 --> 3311.04
negatively by all the cold so they could

3306.72 --> 3311.04
do that too if there were to be

3311.2 --> 3317.839
some kind of land beyond

3314.319 --> 3320.4
our known territories in this realm

3317.839 --> 3322.5589999999997
that are occupied in secret yeah they

3320.4 --> 3325.04
could literally also

3322.559 --> 3326.6400000000003
cable connect us

3325.04 --> 3328.88
through the internet

3326.64 --> 3332.16
we'd have like

3328.88 --> 3333.76
posts antarcticans

3332.16 --> 3336.3999999999996
just on the internet and we wouldn't

3333.76 --> 3336.4
even know it

3347.52 --> 3354.48
undersea cables were developed in the

3350.0 --> 3354.48
night 18 fit what are you talking about

3357.599 --> 3360.599
what

3364.96 --> 3370.64
uh i'm pretty sure they did not develop

3368.16 --> 3372.5589999999997
fiber optic cable

3370.64 --> 3374.839
in the 8050s i don't know where you're

3372.559 --> 3376.6400000000003
getting that from that seems very

3374.839 --> 3378.5589999999997
overkill

3376.64 --> 3380.5589999999997
i mean they might have had the idea

3378.559 --> 3382.7200000000003
already

3380.559 --> 3382.7200000000003
but

3385.04 --> 3393.599
like like a future idea but it was not

3388.799 --> 3395.28
done there was nothing to do it with so

3393.599 --> 3397.6800000000003
unless you want to suggest there was

3395.28 --> 3401.799
actually a computer secret computer

3397.68 --> 3401.799
revolution in the 1800s

3402.0 --> 3408.64
or in the 1900s oh 19 yeah i thought so

3405.839 --> 3408.64
1950s

3409.76 --> 3413.28
i mean like who knows man

3412.16 --> 3415.92
secret

3413.28 --> 3417.6800000000003
tertarian computer age

3415.92 --> 3419.04
that was nipped in the bud and kept

3417.68 --> 3422.319
secret

3419.04 --> 3422.319
this is who knows man

3429.68 --> 3436.5989999999997
talking about routing

3432.4 --> 3436.599
i don't know what that means

3455.28 --> 3462.079
huh that's interesting gadget inspector

3458.16 --> 3464.48
well maybe the cables do have like

3462.079 --> 3466.4
like extra

3464.48 --> 3470.52
like hub points

3466.4 --> 3470.52
in the middle of the ocean even

3474.4 --> 3480.799
or another explanation would be

3478.24 --> 3482.3999999999996
first transatlantic cable was for the

3480.799 --> 3486.7599999999998
telegraph

3482.4 --> 3486.76
right that's a good point

3490.88 --> 3494.7200000000003
right but those are not fiber optic

3492.64 --> 3495.7599999999998
cables those are like electric wire

3494.72 --> 3498.0
cables

3495.76 --> 3501.8390000000004
wi-fi i guess yeah well the problem

3498.0 --> 3504.72
getting inspector is like the ocean

3501.839 --> 3507.44
signals going through water

3504.72 --> 3508.9599999999996
does not work all that great but yeah a

3507.44 --> 3512.64
submarine could

3508.96 --> 3514.4
also basically just submerge i mean uh

3512.64 --> 3516.96
surface

3514.4 --> 3519.2000000000003
stick out an antenna and then any kind

3516.96 --> 3520.64
of like

3519.2 --> 3524.319
tower system

3520.64 --> 3524.319
it would probably be able to pick up

3525.52 --> 3527.7599999999998
so

3528.4 --> 3533.6800000000003
yeah i don't know

3530.48 --> 3533.68
i don't think there's like a

3535.839 --> 3541.359
if there might be like interfacing hubs

3538.319 --> 3543.44
on the internet cables in the ocean

3541.359 --> 3545.2799999999997
it's very unlikely that they're like

3543.44 --> 3547.599
submerged in the water because the

3545.28 --> 3550.92
signal just doesn't travel all that well

3547.599 --> 3550.92
through water

3559.359 --> 3565.2
they have a system we don't know about

3562.48 --> 3565.2
and they are you

3567.44 --> 3574.559
all right well look maybe they have

3571.04 --> 3576.88
information frequencies information

3574.559 --> 3578.3190000000004
radio frequencies that have no problem

3576.88 --> 3580.319
going through water that they're using

3578.319 --> 3584.68
for that i don't know

3580.319 --> 3584.68
top secret [ __ ] yeah i'm not surprised

3594.799 --> 3598.559
all right

3595.68 --> 3601.04
but who knows how far that is

3598.559 --> 3603.119
gonna go with what they are able to do

3601.04 --> 3606.0
with this

3603.119 --> 3608.319
radio communication because maybe maybe

3606.0 --> 3610.16
by now they figured out to literally

3608.319 --> 3611.68
just

3610.16 --> 3613.44
use

3611.68 --> 3616.24
like

3613.44 --> 3619.28
complex field dynamics to somehow

3616.24 --> 3621.4399999999996
completely bypass space and literally

3619.28 --> 3623.2000000000003
just make a connection

3621.44 --> 3625.44
even though there's loads of [ __ ] in

3623.2 --> 3626.64
between maybe they found a way to kind

3625.44 --> 3628.48
of like

3626.64 --> 3630.64
use the

3628.48 --> 3631.839
well the electric ether

3630.64 --> 3633.2799999999997
somehow

3631.839 --> 3636.24
where they can just

3633.28 --> 3636.2400000000002
get signals

3637.52 --> 3640.48
through

3638.96 --> 3643.28
everything even though it's not

3640.48 --> 3645.68
physically passing

3643.28 --> 3646.7200000000003
directly through who knows man what they

3645.68 --> 3648.3999999999996
can do

3646.72 --> 3650.319
like i would not be surprised if they

3648.4 --> 3652.48
can literally just have direct

3650.319 --> 3654.24
connections with everything

3652.48 --> 3656.64
everything

3654.24 --> 3660.24
without any obstacles like there

3656.64 --> 3663.5989999999997
literally would never be an obstacle

3660.24 --> 3666.5989999999997
they could just get a signal anywhere

3663.599 --> 3666.599
anyhow

3671.04 --> 3677.68
by like sort of bypassing space

3675.2 --> 3681.0
electrically who knows what they can do

3677.68 --> 3681.0
i don't know

3684.079 --> 3690.599
sheesh so dark in here

3686.64 --> 3690.5989999999997
even with the light on

3715.119 --> 3720.92
the water does not add resistance what

3727.68 --> 3732.0789999999997
what are you talking this is getting a

3729.839 --> 3734.16
bit confusing here i'm pretty sure that

3732.079 --> 3739.48
like wi-fi signal

3734.16 --> 3739.48
does not travel very far through water

3740.16 --> 3745.7599999999998
i mean it might travel some distance but

3742.88 --> 3750.039
it's going to be a lot less

3745.76 --> 3750.039
than through the air i suspect

3767.92 --> 3772.319
do i like living in the netherlands

3770.799 --> 3774.319
well

3772.319 --> 3777.68
i don't really have anything to compare

3774.319 --> 3782.52
it to other than having gone on vacation

3777.68 --> 3782.52
summer vacation to like spain

3782.64 --> 3786.96
so i've always lived in the netherlands

3787.92 --> 3792.2400000000002
and there's good things about it and

3790.4 --> 3794.88
there's not so good things about it's a

3792.24 --> 3797.5989999999997
very mixed bag

3794.88 --> 3799.839
there's some typical dutch traits that i

3797.599 --> 3801.92
do not like a lot

3799.839 --> 3806.52
but there are some dutch traits that i

3801.92 --> 3806.52
do actually like a lot see so

3813.28 --> 3818.48
oh there white well let's just assume it

3816.079 --> 3821.2000000000003
all then gadget let's just straight out

3818.48 --> 3822.64
assume it there's must be no you don't

3821.2 --> 3824.48
know that

3822.64 --> 3825.2799999999997
it might

3824.48 --> 3826.64
but

3825.28 --> 3829.28
you should

3826.64 --> 3831.44
go by the information available to you

3829.28 --> 3833.6800000000003
and then build on that structurally you

3831.44 --> 3836.64
can't just assume oh they have something

3833.68 --> 3838.72
that just completely bypasses everything

3836.64 --> 3840.72
you're entering sci-fi territory when

3838.72 --> 3841.52
you do that you can't just say they must

3840.72 --> 3845.1189999999997
have

3841.52 --> 3845.119
no you don't know that at all

3845.52 --> 3848.72
they could have

3847.039 --> 3850.4
they could have something

3848.72 --> 3853.4399999999996
some as i already said they could have

3850.4 --> 3856.0
some type of signal that

3853.44 --> 3857.839
that's easier to penetrate through water

3856.0 --> 3860.96
than the regular frequencies available

3857.839 --> 3863.359
to us or they found a communication

3860.96 --> 3866.839
system that just literally bypasses

3863.359 --> 3866.839
space itself

3867.839 --> 3873.52
like a wormhole communication

3871.039 --> 3875.039
locally

3873.52 --> 3878.68
they might even call it that like

3875.039 --> 3878.6800000000003
wormhole communication

3880.079 --> 3884.48
because it's just it's like yeah here's

3881.839 --> 3885.359
the entry signal it seems to just spread

3884.48 --> 3887.119
out

3885.359 --> 3891.359
then there's literally no signal

3887.119 --> 3894.319
detectable anywhere in between the space

3891.359 --> 3896.72
and the receiving end where it kind of

3894.319 --> 3898.64
almost like starts manifesting again

3896.72 --> 3901.1189999999997
onto the receiver

3898.64 --> 3902.799
but like you can't trace its path

3901.119 --> 3904.6400000000003
because like

3902.799 --> 3906.48
it's only

3904.64 --> 3908.0789999999997
where it starts

3906.48 --> 3911.599
and where it's received where you see

3908.079 --> 3912.7200000000003
the signal that's how i would

3911.599 --> 3914.799
imagine

3912.72 --> 3918.4399999999996
it would be functioning if they had

3914.799 --> 3918.44
anything like that

3930.0 --> 3933.0
so

3947.28 --> 3953.8390000000004
right anyway yeah cables cable scales

3949.839 --> 3953.839
it's all about cables today it seems

3954.559 --> 3958.4
that's fine we can talk about cables

3959.76 --> 3965.7990000000004
but i am gonna go to

3961.92 --> 3965.799
two minutes be right back

4052.16 --> 4055.7599999999998
hmm

4053.52 --> 4059.319
all right stevie traveler thank you for

4055.76 --> 4059.3190000000004
that detail

4070.48 --> 4073.48
uh

4076.72 --> 4079.72
god

4110.96 --> 4113.279
what

4113.359 --> 4115.839
cleary

4116.0 --> 4124.199
that's actually a thing that happened

4119.4 --> 4124.199
congratulations and hangs off okay

4146.799 --> 4153.359
you didn't send that message twice okay

4149.199 --> 4154.5599999999995
what it seems to have come through twice

4153.359 --> 4158.4400000000005
weird

4154.56 --> 4158.4400000000005
jazz jeff gassett

4211.44 --> 4214.44
hmm

4223.84 --> 4226.84
hmm

4237.92 --> 4240.719
right anyway

4241.36 --> 4245.32
cables cables cables

4257.52 --> 4262.4800000000005
if they have a system to connect to the

4260.0 --> 4262.48
cables

4265.76 --> 4270.0
oh yeah gadget inspector that's one way

4268.0 --> 4272.56
to do it

4270.0 --> 4274.48
right that way they could stay submerged

4272.56 --> 4276.96
but that

4274.48 --> 4278.799999999999
i think it it's just much easier for

4276.96 --> 4281.12
submarine to kind of like

4278.8 --> 4284.2390000000005
go to the surface stick out a little

4281.12 --> 4287.76
antenna and then receive

4284.239 --> 4290.159
long distance radio communication

4287.76 --> 4294.719
through the towers that's i think that

4290.159 --> 4294.719
would be much easier to actually perform

4295.84 --> 4300.4400000000005
hey one for the unit good to see you

4304.239 --> 4311.799999999999
so can you say that fe cor is a sham

4307.719 --> 4311.8
we ah

4316.96 --> 4323.04
wow

4319.199 --> 4326.32
i mean they've done what they've done

4323.04 --> 4326.32
is it hashem i don't know

4326.88 --> 4333.679
i'm not placing any bets on it

4330.56 --> 4333.679
anytime soon but

4335.6 --> 4340.08
they're not telling any truth what

4338.32 --> 4343.719
have you do you have an example of that

4340.08 --> 4343.719
dan the water man

4346.32 --> 4350.88
making doing a makani curry

4352.719 --> 4356.76
okay

4353.76 --> 4356.76
interesting

4359.84 --> 4364.32
they didn't

4361.6 --> 4366.159000000001
they did [ __ ] in the last three years

4364.32 --> 4368.639999999999
they are broke

4366.159 --> 4371.639999999999
right well

4368.64 --> 4371.64
yeah

4375.12 --> 4380.08
but they didn't like

4377.44 --> 4381.599999999999
totally destroyed it's just they've done

4380.08 --> 4382.8
things

4381.6 --> 4386.64
that's done

4382.8 --> 4386.64
and they're not really moving on

4390.64 --> 4395.1990000000005
so

4391.76 --> 4398.1990000000005
yeah if it's like oh you yeah from my

4395.199 --> 4398.199
perspective

4399.52 --> 4404.0
i don't think that like

4401.12 --> 4405.92
investing in it will truly progress more

4404.0 --> 4409.28
experimentations

4405.92 --> 4409.28
sort of tests

4409.52 --> 4414.159000000001
because they kind of already did it all

4411.84 --> 4416.32
they've already done these things

4414.159 --> 4418.32
right it's just done

4416.32 --> 4421.5199999999995
they kind of like did the measurements

4418.32 --> 4421.5199999999995
the lasers and all that

4424.56 --> 4430.96
there is no no

4427.84 --> 4433.96
what oh so they broke up

4430.96 --> 4433.96
officially

4442.08 --> 4446.159
peter file

4443.84 --> 4448.159000000001
catch it

4446.159 --> 4451.799999999999
oh what

4448.159 --> 4451.799999999999
you're talking about

4454.4 --> 4460.08
no

4455.44 --> 4460.08
no no jake is just the scumbag

4460.96 --> 4466.4800000000005
and a total drug addict

4463.28 --> 4470.719
and he's probably done [ __ ] that he

4466.48 --> 4470.718999999999
can't handle i think he's projecting

4471.12 --> 4475.04
seriously

4472.64 --> 4478.08
that guy is such a big mouth he'll [ __ ]

4475.04 --> 4481.12
on anybody

4478.08 --> 4483.76
to prevent people from discovering

4481.12 --> 4486.8
exactly what he has done

4483.76 --> 4489.4400000000005
the guy is a is like a classic

4486.8 --> 4492.320000000001
reversed world projector case

4489.44 --> 4495.12
everything he does

4492.32 --> 4497.5199999999995
i i don't like yeah he's gonna shove

4495.12 --> 4501.36
[ __ ]

4497.52 --> 4501.360000000001
he's gonna make false accusations

4502.88 --> 4505.12
so

4507.92 --> 4511.159
it's [ __ ]

4517.28 --> 4525.04
like they're not some secret

4520.88 --> 4527.92
peter file ring right that's absolutely

4525.04 --> 4527.92
preposterous

4534.48 --> 4539.199
i mean if that were the case then

4537.199 --> 4541.28
we would notice all of us would like

4539.199 --> 4543.759999999999
literally notice just because you defend

4541.28 --> 4543.759999999999
people

4543.92 --> 4549.04
doesn't mean you're like a ring

4545.84 --> 4549.04
organizing that [ __ ]

4549.84 --> 4554.56
like if if that really were the case

4552.08 --> 4556.48
there would be a whole bunch of really

4554.56 --> 4558.320000000001
shady people

4556.48 --> 4560.799999999999
that would be like

4558.32 --> 4563.199
still noticeably connecting up with them

4560.8 --> 4565.6
that doesn't seem to happen like that

4563.199 --> 4568.0
there's some

4565.6 --> 4569.84
figures that have yeah

4568.0 --> 4572.239
that have been around in the flatter

4569.84 --> 4576.32
scene for a while that that people have

4572.239 --> 4578.639999999999
suspicions of like yeah they

4576.32 --> 4580.799999999999
they have a weird past

4578.64 --> 4582.08
right

4580.8 --> 4584.159000000001
but that's

4582.08 --> 4586.88
i don't that's not like

4584.159 --> 4589.879999999999
on purpose that makes no [ __ ] sense

4586.88 --> 4589.88
whatsoever

4595.679 --> 4602.88
like at best they're like tolerant and

4599.28 --> 4604.48
willingly ignorant about it

4602.88 --> 4606.719
that's the worst thing that i could

4604.48 --> 4609.28
ascribe to the whole group it's like

4606.719 --> 4612.0
they just ignore people's past even if

4609.28 --> 4613.12
it's really terrible

4612.0 --> 4616.08
that's it

4613.12 --> 4621.32
and like that is really it

4616.08 --> 4621.32
nothing else i it doesn't make any sense

4629.12 --> 4633.12
that's rodrigo ferrari nunez oh yeah i

4631.679 --> 4635.4400000000005
remember that

4633.12 --> 4637.599999999999
for his phd credentials

4635.44 --> 4640.919999999999
not let him work on anything

4637.6 --> 4640.92
that's weird

4650.8 --> 4657.1990000000005
i don't see how that relates to anything

4653.76 --> 4657.1990000000005
that was said before though

4660.32 --> 4665.04
bob no no it's blacklisting i don't

4663.199 --> 4666.96
understand how what do you mean with

4665.04 --> 4670.6
that down the water man i have no idea

4666.96 --> 4670.6
what you're talking about

4682.64 --> 4686.88
like i know like i'm not trying to say

4685.04 --> 4688.8
like oh they're all the good guys you

4686.88 --> 4691.1990000000005
know that right no they are

4688.8 --> 4692.400000000001
there's issues yeah bob nodell issues

4691.199 --> 4694.48
big issues

4692.4 --> 4697.759999999999
reification issues

4694.48 --> 4701.759999999999
like empire formation issues wanting to

4697.76 --> 4704.320000000001
replace nasa issues serious issues

4701.76 --> 4707.1990000000005
but that's like isn't that already

4704.32 --> 4709.199
problematic enough right you have to

4707.199 --> 4713.12
make up all this [ __ ]

4709.199 --> 4714.719
beyond that who their secret peter file

4713.12 --> 4718.159
ring bla that's

4714.719 --> 4721.04
it's useless it only distracts away from

4718.159 --> 4723.199
the main issues that are there

4721.04 --> 4726.32
which there are

4723.199 --> 4729.44
reification issues doubling down on

4726.32 --> 4731.36
disproven [ __ ] issues

4729.44 --> 4732.96
right isn't that already problematic

4731.36 --> 4735.36
enough

4732.96 --> 4736.2390000000005
really need to make up more ridiculous

4735.36 --> 4739.28
stuff

4736.239 --> 4741.678999999999
to make it all seem much worse it's why

4739.28 --> 4745.12
why would you even go why would you

4741.679 --> 4747.04
take anybody's suggestion on that

4745.12 --> 4749.04
why

4747.04 --> 4751.04
are you that gullible that somebody has

4749.04 --> 4752.64
to just blurt out some ridiculous

4751.04 --> 4755.5199999999995
accusation like that and you'll just

4752.64 --> 4758.56
immediately take it and start like oh

4755.52 --> 4760.96
maybe it's true really

4758.56 --> 4764.56
really maybe it's true just because some

4760.96 --> 4766.32
random guy literally called [ __ ]

4764.56 --> 4768.159000000001
says it

4766.32 --> 4771.44
that's good enough to actually

4768.159 --> 4775.28
investigate it is it

4771.44 --> 4777.44
or you just really easily manipulate it

4775.28 --> 4781.32
into [ __ ] talk

4777.44 --> 4781.32
which is what the guy does

4790.719 --> 4794.64
i think bob is definitely hiding

4792.719 --> 4796.719
something i don't know

4794.64 --> 4801.719
i i have my own suspicions about the guy

4796.719 --> 4801.719
but it's pointless it's pointless

4802.0 --> 4806.08
like

4802.8 --> 4810.1990000000005
i don't have a case

4806.08 --> 4810.199
suspicions are pointless

4828.639 --> 4832.6
there's a video evidence

4833.92 --> 4838.0
yeah but i think that's just really

4835.76 --> 4840.320000000001
egregious

4838.0 --> 4842.32
viewing like that's biased viewing so

4840.32 --> 4845.96
yeah

4842.32 --> 4845.96
defending it

4846.48 --> 4850.638999999999
does that mean they literally say yeah

4848.8 --> 4853.4400000000005
it's okay

4850.639 --> 4855.12
they're good guys they just happen to be

4853.44 --> 4857.5199999999995
attracted to

4855.12 --> 4859.84
miners or something is that their case

4857.52 --> 4862.400000000001
or is it just trying to say like yeah

4859.84 --> 4863.76
but it's really complicated and annoying

4862.4 --> 4865.839999999999
and

4863.76 --> 4867.92
we don't agree with it

4865.84 --> 4871.1990000000005
but it's a mistake and we accept that is

4867.92 --> 4872.08
it like that or did they literally say

4871.199 --> 4876.0
no

4872.08 --> 4878.4
they're good guys because

4876.0 --> 4879.76
just because they happen to be attracted

4878.4 --> 4883.28
to

4879.76 --> 4886.400000000001
they're not bad did they say that

4883.28 --> 4888.88
or did they just make excuses

4886.4 --> 4893.759999999999
why it wasn't all that bad

4888.88 --> 4897.28
tell the [ __ ] difference man

4893.76 --> 4900.719
wait make your brain work

4897.28 --> 4904.4
figure out what they're doing and why

4900.719 --> 4907.36
did they just straight out say yeah

4904.4 --> 4910.799999999999
being attracted to minors doesn't make

4907.36 --> 4914.4
you a bad person did they say that did

4910.8 --> 4915.92
they say that or did they not say that

4914.4 --> 4919.199
and they were just spending a lot of

4915.92 --> 4922.88
time making up excuses for somebody

4919.199 --> 4926.0
what is it why don't you just say it i

4922.88 --> 4928.400000000001
don't want to continue this

4926.0 --> 4931.199
this endless

4928.4 --> 4932.159
nonsense cycle

4931.199 --> 4935.28
stop

4932.159 --> 4937.599999999999
playing into this outrageous accusation

4935.28 --> 4937.599999999999

4953.12 --> 4957.04
did she say

4955.199 --> 4959.759999999999
just because he did that doesn't make

4957.04 --> 4961.84
him a bad person made mistakes in the

4959.76 --> 4966.159000000001
past

4961.84 --> 4966.159000000001
or did he say like yeah it's

4966.4 --> 4970.48

5049.52 --> 5054.8
what did they say

5052.159 --> 5054.799999999999
literally

5054.84 --> 5059.12
literally

5056.56 --> 5062.080000000001
no more indirect rumor [ __ ] i don't want

5059.12 --> 5065.04
to see that here anymore you understand

5062.08 --> 5068.04
say it literally what did they literally

5065.04 --> 5068.04
say

5073.52 --> 5080.080000000001
blame it on the 40 year old

5076.239 --> 5081.759999999999
well yeah that's disgusting thing to say

5080.08 --> 5086.239
that's right

5081.76 --> 5089.52
what did that girl hide her identity

5086.239 --> 5089.5199999999995
yeah probably

5089.92 --> 5096.4800000000005
right so again that's making up excuses

5093.04 --> 5097.76
it's disgusting it's disgusting joking

5096.48 --> 5099.919999999999
very ill

5097.76 --> 5102.2390000000005
ill-mannered

5099.92 --> 5103.84
yeah i agree with that right but thank

5102.239 --> 5106.239
you by the way for finally getting a

5103.84 --> 5108.96
little specific for crying out loud did

5106.239 --> 5111.5199999999995
they say it's okay though did they

5108.96 --> 5115.199
literally say that or is it just this

5111.52 --> 5117.52
stupid really disgusting joke about it

5115.199 --> 5120.919999999999
what is it

5117.52 --> 5120.92
what is it

5138.32 --> 5144.799999999999
they said a 14 year go what

5141.84 --> 5147.6
who said that gadget inspector

5144.8 --> 5150.88
i want clips i want you to send me clips

5147.6 --> 5153.360000000001
to my email of that literally

5150.88 --> 5157.76
never heard anything like that

5153.36 --> 5161.12
because that is literally over the line

5157.76 --> 5162.88
14 years not old enough

5161.12 --> 5166.28
but yeah are you sure you're getting

5162.88 --> 5166.28
that in context

5179.04 --> 5185.84
if you haven't searched out yet what the

5182.08 --> 5185.84
[ __ ] are you blabbering about agm

5187.44 --> 5192.48
like could you try to formulate a

5190.0 --> 5196.52
coherent english sentence

5192.48 --> 5196.5199999999995
and then get back at me

5208.0 --> 5211.719
okay gadget inspector

5212.639 --> 5216.719
the guy uncurrent that's

5214.96 --> 5219.84
so yeah okay

5216.719 --> 5222.84
that is absolutely disgusting

5219.84 --> 5222.84
absolutely

5241.28 --> 5248.48
right so the guy on karenbees said that

5245.36 --> 5251.36
so did karen b reflect on that afterward

5248.48 --> 5254.48
as in yeah i don't agree with that

5251.36 --> 5257.199
or did she just let it all slide and act

5254.48 --> 5259.5199999999995
like nothing special happened

5257.199 --> 5261.919999999999
right because people have thrown out

5259.52 --> 5265.1990000000005
some crazy [ __ ]

5261.92 --> 5268.32
at times and they just let it go

5265.199 --> 5268.32
they just let it happen

5268.56 --> 5271.360000000001
because they don't really know how to

5270.08 --> 5273.84
deal with it

5271.36 --> 5275.759999999999
like they don't know how to get angry in

5273.84 --> 5279.28
the moment when that happens like they

5275.76 --> 5281.679
don't know how to do it they don't know

5279.28 --> 5283.92
how to do it i've noticed this they

5281.679 --> 5286.8
don't know how to do it

5283.92 --> 5290.32
they don't know how to get angry in the

5286.8 --> 5293.04
moment when people show extremely ugly

5290.32 --> 5295.04
sides of themselves live they don't know

5293.04 --> 5299.08
how to deal with it i don't understand

5295.04 --> 5299.08
why but they don't

5321.36 --> 5326.5599999999995
right so yeah

5324.08 --> 5328.5599999999995
the more i'm hearing this the more i

5326.56 --> 5332.080000000001
realize

5328.56 --> 5334.400000000001
they are just agitating they're just

5332.08 --> 5336.48
agitating they're not actually promoting

5334.4 --> 5337.679
it but they're getting on the board you

5336.48 --> 5340.0
know what they're doing they're

5337.679 --> 5342.719
literally

5340.0 --> 5344.719
carving on your heart

5342.719 --> 5348.159
because it makes you believe that they

5344.719 --> 5350.08
might be pro peter file right

5348.159 --> 5351.5199999999995
they're not actually doing it so it

5350.08 --> 5352.96
seems

5351.52 --> 5356.2390000000005
they're just

5352.96 --> 5360.08
literally carving on your heart

5356.239 --> 5363.36
to make you get all obsessed and [ __ ]

5360.08 --> 5365.84
and talk about this which by the way is

5363.36 --> 5368.5599999999995
[ __ ] black magic

5365.84 --> 5371.1990000000005
satanic black magic to do that it's

5368.56 --> 5374.639
really [ __ ] evil

5371.199 --> 5374.638999999999
and yeah i suspected

5375.12 --> 5379.12
even karen b directly

5377.44 --> 5382.799999999999
of just doing that

5379.12 --> 5384.4
without any objection

5382.8 --> 5385.679
like

5384.4 --> 5387.839999999999
yeah

5385.679 --> 5390.4
so

5387.84 --> 5392.0
that doesn't mean they are

5390.4 --> 5393.839999999999
pro

5392.0 --> 5395.52
this thing you see

5393.84 --> 5399.84
you see

5395.52 --> 5402.88
it's just them trying to [ __ ] you up

5399.84 --> 5406.0
so you will be obsessed over this [ __ ]

5402.88 --> 5408.159000000001
and whining to other people about it all

5406.0 --> 5410.4
day long

5408.159 --> 5414.0
haven't they succeeded have they not

5410.4 --> 5414.96
succeeded making you whine about this

5414.0 --> 5417.76
[ __ ]

5414.96 --> 5420.4
all day long they got you

5417.76 --> 5422.96
they got you didn't didn't they

5420.4 --> 5425.839999999999
they don't have direct proof they didn't

5422.96 --> 5429.28
actually literally condone

5425.84 --> 5432.08
pedophilia right they didn't do that

5429.28 --> 5435.5199999999995
but they got so on the edge that you're

5432.08 --> 5438.0
now talking about this [ __ ] all the time

5435.52 --> 5438.0
don't they

5439.76 --> 5445.12
am i not right

5442.639 --> 5447.6

5469.44 --> 5473.12
blabbering i want you to directly

5471.6 --> 5475.84
address what i've been trying to say in

5473.12 --> 5477.28
the last five minutes am i right am i

5475.84 --> 5480.2390000000005
wrong

5477.28 --> 5480.239

5482.88 --> 5485.88
now

5501.36 --> 5506.5599999999995
protectors of manufacts what

5509.28 --> 5514.239
summarize again no no you're just gonna

5511.28 --> 5514.239
have to scroll back

5514.56 --> 5519.719
but jeff gas had actually did pay

5516.719 --> 5519.719
attention

5527.36 --> 5533.679
i'm i'm upset because you're all

5530.88 --> 5534.96
just straight out starting to accuse

5533.679 --> 5536.96
people

5534.96 --> 5539.84
of being

5536.96 --> 5542.719
super evil which is what that is

5539.84 --> 5546.639
right actual condoning

5542.719 --> 5548.4800000000005
of sex with minors actually not jokingly

5546.639 --> 5550.639
not saying oh

5548.48 --> 5551.44
yeah just they wanna

5550.639 --> 5553.6
right

5551.44 --> 5554.96
but just actually saying like no i think

5553.6 --> 5557.679
that's okay

5554.96 --> 5561.52
i think that adults should be able to do

5557.679 --> 5564.639
that legally right that's condoning it

5561.52 --> 5565.84
that's actually straight out satanic

5564.639 --> 5568.400000000001
evil

5565.84 --> 5570.8
straight out satanic evil if they do

5568.4 --> 5572.879999999999
that if they just [ __ ] joke around

5570.8 --> 5576.719
about it you know what they're doing

5572.88 --> 5578.32
they're clawing on your heart

5576.719 --> 5580.44
they're literally

5578.32 --> 5582.239
binding you

5580.44 --> 5585.44
binding

5582.239 --> 5587.599999999999
you your spirit your consciousness to

5585.44 --> 5590.48
what they do

5587.6 --> 5592.0
to make you paranoid about

5590.48 --> 5595.599999999999
that day

5592.0 --> 5599.04
or secretly a peter phil ring as you

5595.6 --> 5601.360000000001
said right that's spell binding binding

5599.04 --> 5603.44
you making you obsessed

5601.36 --> 5605.12
making you discontinue what you were

5603.44 --> 5607.199
normally doing

5605.12 --> 5608.96
and getting obsessed over that that's

5607.199 --> 5611.839999999999
what that is

5608.96 --> 5615.199
it doesn't actually prove anything you

5611.84 --> 5616.719
see unless they straight out straight

5615.199 --> 5619.839999999999
out condone

5616.719 --> 5621.76
not joking not walking around it but

5619.84 --> 5624.32
straight out just say i think adult

5621.76 --> 5625.1990000000005
should be able to do that

5624.32 --> 5627.199
yeah

5625.199 --> 5631.4
that

5627.199 --> 5631.4
would be definitive evidence

5645.36 --> 5649.599999999999
yeah i am upset i am very upset when

5647.679 --> 5653.28
people

5649.6 --> 5657.280000000001
are getting dragged into satanic spells

5653.28 --> 5660.32
that make them obsessed with [ __ ]

5657.28 --> 5662.4
and unproven things make you paranoia

5660.32 --> 5664.159
make your paranoia

5662.4 --> 5665.92
starting to think certain things that

5664.159 --> 5668.0
are egregious

5665.92 --> 5670.639
that there is no direct evidence for

5668.0 --> 5672.88
spellbinding you you'll be looking

5670.639 --> 5675.36
constantly like oh are they gonna go

5672.88 --> 5677.4400000000005
over that line now are they uh are they

5675.36 --> 5680.239
gonna reveal their evil yeah that's

5677.44 --> 5683.96
called spell binding

5680.239 --> 5683.959999999999
you get it yet

5701.119 --> 5704.0
yeah

5702.08 --> 5707.5199999999995
they do it

5704.0 --> 5710.56
to agitate you so that you get obsessed

5707.52 --> 5710.56
going after them

5711.36 --> 5716.88
so that you will lose cohesion and

5713.84 --> 5719.679
control and be distracted from whatever

5716.88 --> 5721.4400000000005
you were developing at the time

5719.679 --> 5724.96
right

5721.44 --> 5727.119
crystal of oversight clarity will break

5724.96 --> 5728.719
down when you engage

5727.119 --> 5730.799999999999
that's what it does

5728.719 --> 5732.639
literally break it down

5730.8 --> 5736.320000000001
make you less cohesive make you have

5732.639 --> 5738.159000000001
less oversight make you not realize

5736.32 --> 5739.599999999999
brilliant new things

5738.159 --> 5743.48
that's what it does

5739.6 --> 5743.4800000000005
when you engage with that

5753.6 --> 5758.719
do not watch who is talking yeah they're

5756.0 --> 5758.719
talking about

5763.28 --> 5767.04
talk about karen b apparently

5769.119 --> 5773.28
and yeah it's getting

5770.48 --> 5774.48
like karen b hey hey i'm getting really

5773.28 --> 5777.599999999999
sick

5774.48 --> 5781.199
of this feedback i'm getting indirectly

5777.6 --> 5783.679
hey karen b maybe you should stop acting

5781.199 --> 5786.719
like an evil witch

5783.679 --> 5789.76
an evil satanic witch

5786.719 --> 5791.76
which is what these things are traits of

5789.76 --> 5793.04
maybe you should stop doing that and

5791.76 --> 5794.159000000001
[ __ ] off

5793.04 --> 5796.56
[ __ ]

5794.159 --> 5798.96
yeah i said it

5796.56 --> 5800.159000000001
because i'm not gonna accuse you of

5798.96 --> 5802.639
actually

5800.159 --> 5806.32
the suspicions of these things but you

5802.639 --> 5808.0
are acting like an evil witch

5806.32 --> 5810.159
by doing that [ __ ]

5808.0 --> 5814.159
you should absolutely stop it

5810.159 --> 5815.599999999999
there is no justification

5814.159 --> 5819.44
imaginable

5815.6 --> 5820.8
to start condoning

5819.44 --> 5824.839999999999
defense

5820.8 --> 5828.320000000001
of sex with minors there is no

5824.84 --> 5830.0
imaginable justification for this

5828.32 --> 5832.5599999999995
if you do that

5830.0 --> 5835.119
even joking around about that just

5832.56 --> 5836.400000000001
joking around about it but it makes you

5835.119 --> 5841.04
evil

5836.4 --> 5842.799999999999
straight out satanic evil karen b

5841.04 --> 5843.6
you understand

5842.8 --> 5846.719
don't

5843.6 --> 5847.92
[ __ ] dare continuing this disgusting

5846.719 --> 5850.0
display

5847.92 --> 5853.32
don't you [ __ ] there if you do that

5850.0 --> 5853.32
[ __ ] off

5866.96 --> 5871.84
yeah then the water man well yeah look

5868.8 --> 5872.96
they're all close buddy buddy right

5871.84 --> 5874.96
and

5872.96 --> 5878.2390000000005
yeah they're gonna be upset about this

5874.96 --> 5880.4800000000005
like the the guys the rest of the guys

5878.239 --> 5883.919999999999
they're not gonna be untouched by karen

5880.48 --> 5884.799999999999
b getting really [ __ ] satanic witchy

5883.92 --> 5886.4800000000005
like

5884.8 --> 5888.88
they're not going to be happy about it

5886.48 --> 5892.239
right so at first they're going to be

5888.88 --> 5894.56
the typical protocol which is ignore all

5892.239 --> 5896.0
accusations and throw it out

5894.56 --> 5897.360000000001
because you don't want to deal with it

5896.0 --> 5899.76
that's what they do that's what they

5897.36 --> 5902.4
have been doing since the start it's

5899.76 --> 5904.159000000001
standard protocol in their social

5902.4 --> 5906.239
operating system

5904.159 --> 5908.239
that's what they do they've always done

5906.239 --> 5909.599999999999
that

5908.239 --> 5911.599999999999
accusations

5909.6 --> 5913.6
straight out into the garbage can and

5911.6 --> 5915.92
then maybe

5913.6 --> 5917.52
maybe slowly try to figure out if

5915.92 --> 5919.92
there's something

5917.52 --> 5921.92
playing and what can you do about it

5919.92 --> 5923.679
and deal with it behind the scenes

5921.92 --> 5925.76
that's what they all do that's what

5923.679 --> 5929.6
jaren does

5925.76 --> 5930.400000000001
and i do respect jaren

5929.6 --> 5932.4800000000005
right

5930.4 --> 5934.5599999999995
and that's what all the fe core guys

5932.48 --> 5937.199
kind of do it like that so that's how

5934.56 --> 5937.1990000000005
they operate

5937.28 --> 5941.199
that that then throwing you out doesn't

5939.6 --> 5942.96
mean anything it just means they have

5941.199 --> 5945.44
kind of

5942.96 --> 5946.719
yeah a quick to ban policy which is

5945.44 --> 5949.199
stupid

5946.719 --> 5951.04
in my opinion it's not a good thing to

5949.199 --> 5952.879999999999
do it like that

5951.04 --> 5953.6
they should have moved on they should

5952.88 --> 5956.400000000001
have

5953.6 --> 5958.4800000000005
evolved the way they deal with chats and

5956.4 --> 5960.719
people's commentary they should evolve

5958.48 --> 5962.48
that they haven't really done that as

5960.719 --> 5965.96
far as i can see

5962.48 --> 5965.959999999999
and that's bad

5970.159 --> 5975.599999999999
but yeah if if it's really true

5973.44 --> 5978.638999999999
if it's really true that karen b is just

5975.6 --> 5982.4800000000005
continuing egregious

5978.639 --> 5985.1990000000005
seeming peter filed defense

5982.48 --> 5987.839999999999
things on her shows then she is a

5985.199 --> 5990.5599999999995
satanic witch and she needs to be

5987.84 --> 5992.96
exercised from the community entirely as

5990.56 --> 5997.52
in [ __ ] off witch

5992.96 --> 6000.88
keep your disgusting peter file defense

5997.52 --> 6003.119000000001
egregious talk keep that the [ __ ] out

6000.88 --> 6006.08
and [ __ ] off with your [ __ ] peter

6003.119 --> 6008.719
file friends like [ __ ] off

6006.08 --> 6010.5599999999995
don't ever show your ugly witch face

6008.719 --> 6012.8
again if you're really gonna be doing

6010.56 --> 6012.8
that

6012.88 --> 6016.96
you understand

6014.56 --> 6019.52
i don't give a [ __ ]

6016.96 --> 6023.6
for the past if you are gonna go there

6019.52 --> 6025.679
we exercise you for the satanic witch

6023.6 --> 6029.119000000001
that you reveal yourself to be if that

6025.679 --> 6029.119
is actually what you're doing

6030.159 --> 6032.96
so yeah

6033.28 --> 6037.44
i hope that addresses it and can finally

6035.52 --> 6041.040000000001
move on because i'm getting really

6037.44 --> 6041.04
agitated from all this [ __ ]

6042.96 --> 6048.88
i actually met karen b in person

6046.8 --> 6051.119000000001
she didn't seem

6048.88 --> 6053.6
evil

6051.119 --> 6055.28
but she did seem

6053.6 --> 6058.0
desensitized

6055.28 --> 6061.44
and neutral

6058.0 --> 6064.48
right like neutral neutral

6061.44 --> 6067.678999999999
most people have absolutely no clue what

6064.48 --> 6070.718999999999
neutral really is

6067.679 --> 6072.639
like how for example antonio suburets

6070.719 --> 6074.32
was absolutely

6072.639 --> 6076.4800000000005
neutral

6074.32 --> 6079.119
chaotic neutral

6076.48 --> 6082.08
neutral with a lot of ego

6079.119 --> 6083.199
that was predominant that got control in

6082.08 --> 6085.6
the moment

6083.199 --> 6087.599999999999
that's chaotic neutral karen b is not

6085.6 --> 6089.280000000001
chaotic neutral karen b is more true

6087.6 --> 6093.84
neutral

6089.28 --> 6093.84
that's how she works is how she operates

6094.159 --> 6098.638999999999
i met her in person

6096.0 --> 6098.639
shook her hand

6100.32 --> 6104.799999999999
but if she is actually just taking on

6102.88 --> 6106.88
this insane

6104.8 --> 6108.2390000000005
liberal move

6106.88 --> 6111.36
then

6108.239 --> 6115.119
i am absolutely don't want to have any

6111.36 --> 6115.119
association with her ever again

6119.199 --> 6123.599999999999
but i don't know if she does maybe she

6121.679 --> 6125.36
sort of is doing that maybe she will

6123.6 --> 6127.360000000001
just suddenly realize like oh maybe

6125.36 --> 6128.48
that's not a good thing to do oh i

6127.36 --> 6130.719
cannot

6128.48 --> 6133.28
like yeah desensitized she didn't really

6130.719 --> 6135.199
feel the difference i don't know

6133.28 --> 6137.92
maybe she just didn't realize what she

6135.199 --> 6140.799999999999
was doing which is ridiculous by the way

6137.92 --> 6143.76
which makes you incompetent socially

6140.8 --> 6146.719
incompetent so you choose karen b you

6143.76 --> 6150.159000000001
want to be a disgusting evil undercover

6146.719 --> 6151.679
satanic witch or you want to be socially

6150.159 --> 6153.28
incompetent

6151.679 --> 6156.8
you choose

6153.28 --> 6156.8
there's no other option there

6156.96 --> 6163.08
so get your [ __ ]

6159.28 --> 6163.08
situation straight

6163.44 --> 6170.04
because this is not good for anybody

6166.4 --> 6170.04
including yourself

6177.92 --> 6183.76
seems like gossip

6180.239 --> 6185.36
yeah well it is relevant though

6183.76 --> 6187.04
but sure if you don't want to talk about

6185.36 --> 6188.5599999999995
it you don't have to talk about it right

6187.04 --> 6192.4
this show doesn't always have to be

6188.56 --> 6195.119000000001
about what you say in chat david hall

6192.4 --> 6198.719
yeah there's plenty of people here

6195.119 --> 6200.32
and there are community issues that are

6198.719 --> 6202.56
important

6200.32 --> 6205.5199999999995
because these people

6202.56 --> 6207.679
a lot of these people are part of

6205.52 --> 6210.400000000001
the same movement it's not the group

6207.679 --> 6212.8
it's the movement and we're all having

6210.4 --> 6216.04
indirect ties it's important to address

6212.8 --> 6216.04
these things

6220.159 --> 6223.159
uh

6233.92 --> 6239.28
flat earth is stuck in a rut and that's

6236.4 --> 6242.32
[ __ ] now flat earth has won

6239.28 --> 6246.4
we've intellectually won

6242.32 --> 6250.08
but really really hardcore one as

6246.4 --> 6250.08
no escape ever

6250.159 --> 6255.759999999999
no matter what happens

6252.4 --> 6258.879999999999
it will be known forever the earth is

6255.76 --> 6262.320000000001
not as fair and is flat

6258.88 --> 6265.1990000000005
forever no escaping no reasoning no

6262.32 --> 6268.799999999999
delusion that can be cut like even

6265.199 --> 6272.08
myself as balwin i can never

6268.8 --> 6274.96
conjure any kind of trainer thinking no

6272.08 --> 6275.84
matter how eloquent it seems that could

6274.96 --> 6279.92
make

6275.84 --> 6281.28
ball earth a reality ever we've won all

6279.92 --> 6285.1990000000005
of this [ __ ]

6281.28 --> 6289.36
is basically people holding the fort

6285.199 --> 6291.919999999999
while everything transforms outside

6289.36 --> 6293.92
and they want us to topple they want the

6291.92 --> 6295.679
leaders to be gone they want the ones

6293.92 --> 6299.52
that actually inserted the information

6295.679 --> 6303.28
to all go be gone to drop to stop

6299.52 --> 6304.8
because then they can insert a fake

6303.28 --> 6307.84
movement

6304.8 --> 6308.639
do a flat earth awakening

6307.84 --> 6311.360000000001
oh

6308.639 --> 6313.679
wow it turns out to be flat and then

6311.36 --> 6315.759999999999
they have all their people very easily

6313.679 --> 6317.92
they already have all the developed

6315.76 --> 6320.639
arguments that we made that they'll

6317.92 --> 6322.88
ignore comes from us and we'll just

6320.639 --> 6325.679
act like we've never existed

6322.88 --> 6328.400000000001
and then they'll literally take over the

6325.679 --> 6330.719
world with that with green light

6328.4 --> 6333.92
because they will be the next layer of

6330.719 --> 6335.119
the system taking over

6333.92 --> 6337.6
after

6335.119 --> 6340.0
the original people from the awakening

6337.6 --> 6342.84
are all off the scene

6340.0 --> 6346.0
they will be ignored and then it'll be

6342.84 --> 6348.159000000001
revolutionary flat earth developments

6346.0 --> 6350.0
and it will get all the tv time and all

6348.159 --> 6352.239
that [ __ ]

6350.0 --> 6355.04
right so revolutionary

6352.239 --> 6356.718999999999
and then it'll be suddenly like oh yo

6355.04 --> 6358.48
dude

6356.719 --> 6359.76
we've all been waiting for a very long

6358.48 --> 6362.959999999999
time for this

6359.76 --> 6366.320000000001
but it's time to go after the jews

6362.96 --> 6370.679
you know they will [ __ ] do that okay

6366.32 --> 6370.679
you [ __ ] know it

6372.239 --> 6375.759999999999
yeah

6373.6 --> 6377.6
so they're just waiting biting their

6375.76 --> 6378.639
time the system

6377.6 --> 6381.52
out there

6378.639 --> 6382.639
until the original wave

6381.52 --> 6385.52
people

6382.639 --> 6386.8
are all dropped off the seat all bullied

6385.52 --> 6389.119000000001
away

6386.8 --> 6391.52
as they're being censored from the wider

6389.119 --> 6393.92
audience still in their own right i'll

6391.52 --> 6395.1990000000005
keep on doing that until it's all gone

6393.92 --> 6397.08
and then they can

6395.199 --> 6400.08
suddenly have a

6397.08 --> 6402.8
spontaneous flat earth awakening oh look

6400.08 --> 6405.199
all the media is cooperating oh it's

6402.8 --> 6408.96
like the first time ever

6410.719 --> 6415.28
had the whole corona crisis and all that

6413.36 --> 6418.5599999999995
so they all forgot how people are just

6415.28 --> 6421.36
either dead or demented or just

6418.56 --> 6423.6
right nobody's gonna remember about the

6421.36 --> 6425.679
actual flat earth awakening no no no

camera oh he must be crazy like that's

6854.56 --> 6859.4400000000005
that's like the best they got

sean just goes after everybody

6954.639 --> 6960.84
in the flat earth he's like a flattered

6956.32 --> 6960.84
debate panelist obsessed person

6961.44 --> 6964.96
and i'm in there of course

6963.36 --> 6967.04
i'm the oldest

6964.96 --> 6971.8
remaining panelist

6967.04 --> 6971.8
at fed did anybody realize that

6976.08 --> 6979.36
man it's getting dark already

6982.32 --> 6987.04
right so

6983.599 --> 6989.84
yeah pretty heavy show today

6987.04 --> 6989.84
not me

6989.92 --> 6992.92
what

7006.08 --> 7010.159

giving up now seven dislikes oh okay

7015.04 --> 7017.84
huh

7030.639 --> 7035.92
oh and polish goes about thinking about

7032.56 --> 7035.92
the shape of the earth right

7037.599 --> 7042.56
oh i'm i do it too sometimes well not

7040.48 --> 7045.119
the shape of the earth but i do like

7042.56 --> 7048.159000000001
often wonder like

7045.119 --> 7051.839999999999
how is this contained what are the the

7048.159 --> 7054.08
places outside how do does it connect

7051.84 --> 7056.08
like how do do the loops open do my

7054.08 --> 7059.44
suspicions actually

7056.08 --> 7062.239
work is that real are my suspicions real

7059.44 --> 7064.32
of the dynamics of this

7062.239 --> 7066.48
multi-realm segment system is that

7064.32 --> 7069.28
really it

7066.48 --> 7072.879999999999
like i do actually go to bed

7069.28 --> 7075.199
sometimes wondering about that

7072.88 --> 7077.119
but i'm not like worried i'm just like

7075.199 --> 7078.719
wondering like would it be like this

7077.119 --> 7080.0
would it be like that what are the hints

7078.719 --> 7084.08
what are the hints what are the hints

7080.0 --> 7086.4
where can i see traces of this how can i

7084.08 --> 7089.599
get hints of this right that's that's

7086.4 --> 7089.598999999999
what i do sometimes

7095.44 --> 7100.4
is it i sky ice what

7098.84 --> 7101.52
no

7100.4 --> 7102.96
right

7101.52 --> 7105.119000000001
anyway

7102.96 --> 7107.92
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

7105.119 --> 7110.239
liked this show it was quite rowdy

7107.92 --> 7112.32
big chunk of it

7110.239 --> 7115.36
some

7112.32 --> 7118.88
internal issues with like the flat earth

7115.36 --> 7121.04
community and like yeah i gave somebody

7118.88 --> 7122.88
a hard talk too

7121.04 --> 7126.239
basically indirectly

7122.88 --> 7129.52
because if that is all true then yeah

7126.239 --> 7132.08
that is egregious

7129.52 --> 7134.719
but i'm keeping it open i'm not just

7132.08 --> 7135.599
saying oh that means that is this now

7134.719 --> 7137.679
but

7135.599 --> 7139.84
at some point you got to basically say

7137.679 --> 7143.28
look if this is correct

7139.84 --> 7145.1990000000005
then this is what i think about it

7143.28 --> 7147.36
and that's what i did so that's not just

7145.199 --> 7151.119
straight out saying this is what i think

7147.36 --> 7151.119
about you no that's conditional

7151.28 --> 7157.36
that was conditional just so you know

7154.96 --> 7159.199
depending on how bad it really is and

7157.36 --> 7162.239
what her intention is i don't really

7159.199 --> 7164.799999999999
follow her show anymore so

7162.239 --> 7167.839999999999
i haven't actually taken a look in order

7164.8 --> 7170.08
to make up my mind about it

7167.84 --> 7172.88
but i am getting really sick of all the

7170.08 --> 7172.88
rumor [ __ ]

7176.159 --> 7179.5199999999995
yeah then the waterman

7178.159 --> 7181.44
take it easy

7179.52 --> 7183.360000000001
all right yeah i know you brought a

7181.44 --> 7185.44
subject to my show

7183.36 --> 7189.44
but then you just

7185.44 --> 7192.239
kept going and going and going and

7189.44 --> 7193.598999999999
at some point it's just enough okay

7192.239 --> 7195.119
it's enough

7193.599 --> 7198.56
and that's why i timed you out because

7195.119 --> 7201.04
you were literally rambling

7198.56 --> 7203.76
non-stop my whole chat was filled up

7201.04 --> 7203.76
with your comments

7204.32 --> 7207.92
right so take it easy

7206.719 --> 7211.119
right

7207.92 --> 7213.36
anyway if you did like this show despite

7211.119 --> 7215.119
it being all rowdy and all that maybe

7213.36 --> 7216.159
you didn't like what i said about karen

7215.119 --> 7216.96
b

7216.159 --> 7219.28
well

7216.96 --> 7220.159
that's too bad because i'm not taking it

7219.28 --> 7222.159
back

7220.159 --> 7224.48
but i did clarify

7222.159 --> 7228.159
what it actually meant right it's a

7224.48 --> 7230.32
conditional it's conditional what i said

7228.159 --> 7231.5199999999995
not just straight out this is how i'm

7230.32 --> 7232.88
gonna be

7231.52 --> 7235.599
right

7232.88 --> 7237.84
so if you did like it after all then

7261.28 --> 7266.08
urgently right now because i've just had

7263.44 --> 7269.36
massive donations

7266.08 --> 7271.28

7278.8 --> 7281.84
yeah

7279.679 --> 7284.2390000000005
dealing with this specific subject like

7281.84 --> 7285.4400000000005
the second half of my show

7284.239 --> 7287.44
i'm sorry

7285.44 --> 7288.719
if you didn't like that

7287.44 --> 7290.879999999999
but yeah

7288.719 --> 7292.56
it was addressed i addressed it and

7290.88 --> 7293.92
there's nothing i can do about it right

7292.56 --> 7296.0
now

7293.92 --> 7298.96
i'm not gonna delete this show i never

7296.0 --> 7301.52
delete shows ever no matter how

7298.96 --> 7303.84
ridiculous or embarrassing i feel about

7301.52 --> 7305.52
it afterward i never do that ever i'm

7303.84 --> 7307.28
not gonna delete yesterday's show as

7305.52 --> 7308.8
well and i was completely it was

7307.28 --> 7312.32
ridiculous

7308.8 --> 7314.320000000001
i was just not in control

7312.32 --> 7315.599
so but i'm still not gonna delete it i

7314.32 --> 7318.88
