36.4 --> 40.33

36.91 --> 45.669999999999995

40.33 --> 49.29
regular cigarette smoke sitting in that

45.67 --> 49.29
Sun so good

54.86 --> 59.68
every times very having times

61.71 --> 67.71000000000001

64.71 --> 70.25999999999999
know the weather's it's going up and

67.71 --> 73.52
down and up and down although you had I

70.26 --> 76.47
did actually watch some Dutch television

73.52 --> 80.25
yesterday and it's weird because

76.47 --> 82.83
sometimes it kind of is kind of good you

80.25 --> 87.5
know of course there's only creepy

82.83 --> 91.979
liberal [ __ ] sort of woven in between

87.5 --> 98.18
can't help it but sometimes it can be

91.979 --> 102.4
kind of good anyway oops

98.18 --> 104.99000000000001
the weather seems to be mouthing and

102.4 --> 109.07000000000001
it's gonna be not so cold in the coming

104.99 --> 112.33
few days so the weather report says I'm

109.07 --> 112.33
kind of looking forward to that

119.76 --> 124.61
also

121.47 --> 129.56
having a pretty intense conversation

124.61 --> 129.56
it's Hagrid wells brother

133.88 --> 141.07999999999998
yeah

136.2 --> 141.07999999999998
they both have the crazy past

148.42 --> 156.47
and we we kind of talked about the

153.11 --> 159.29000000000002
nature of yeah what I went through

156.47 --> 161.78
couple of days ago of course everybody

159.29 --> 165.10999999999999
remembers that it's not like I can ever

161.78 --> 167.39000000000001
forget or like you people and the trolls

165.11 --> 170.9
whatever allow me to forget that but I

167.39 --> 175.0
don't really want to I want to I want to

170.9 --> 175.0
own it I did it for a reason

176.43 --> 182.579
to raise the bar or something the notes

180.329 --> 184.47
would be a matter of perspective

182.579 --> 189.03
trolls would obviously seeing it as

184.47 --> 192.079
lowering the bar I see it as raising the

189.03 --> 192.079
bar of truth

194.4 --> 201.28
yeah that

196.99 --> 204.61
the pain all that no intro tense times

201.28 --> 207.34
and how that expresses itself and what

204.61 --> 210.25
starts to happen when you go on to that

207.34 --> 212.49
pressure those really weird things can

210.25 --> 212.49
happen

213.8 --> 217.81
when you're under the under serious

215.78 --> 217.81
pressure

223.489 --> 227.409
this world is just so

228.04 --> 235.909
fascinating and odd

231.51 --> 235.909
and creepy and miraculous

237.74 --> 243.67000000000002
gods it's one hell of a designer I can

241.13 --> 243.67
tell you that

249.05 --> 251.68

335.32 --> 347.55
Arkady's arrow gage a righteous force

339.57 --> 347.55
under zis laws and Tintin tinted Monaco

351.08 --> 356.47999999999996
I'm going Danielle Mary

357.63 --> 365.24
and Winfield ute good to see you guys

361.14 --> 365.24
gals Michael or work

373.18 --> 379.94
I don't feel so much better today and

377.04 --> 379.94
today is gonna

380.69 --> 389.9
be a good day at least today thank God

384.11 --> 393.89
and I'm gonna be doing some D&D game

389.9 --> 396.04999999999995
this evening with smaller group it's the

393.89 --> 398.27
same group but two people are are

396.05 --> 401.68
staying out of it so it's actually gonna

398.27 --> 407.96
be a Dutch DD potentially that's funny

401.68 --> 411.11
yeah those other tools are a Brit and a

407.96 --> 413.81
Norwegian and yeah they can't really

411.11 --> 416.78000000000003
speak Dutch properly so we all speak

413.81 --> 418.94
English but now those two are too busy

416.78 --> 421.03
so we can do it all in Dutch it's kind

418.94 --> 425.57
of awkward we may actually refer to

421.03 --> 429.61999999999995
English because we're so used to it and

425.57 --> 436.07
I'm also gonna try to share some of this

429.62 --> 439.12
personal [ __ ] because yeah it's I opened

436.07 --> 439.12
up that box and

441.4 --> 449.919
it's gonna be hard to hide that from

444.76 --> 453.84
anyone that knows me because it's kind

449.919 --> 453.84
of important the whole context

456.49 --> 464.59000000000003
for some many people it'll help to make

460.75 --> 467.47
sense of who I am and why I am the way I

464.59 --> 471.63
am I think that's the funny thing about

467.47 --> 473.98
real truth it usually does it's usually

471.63 --> 478.12
when you know the real truth about

473.98 --> 480.40000000000003
somebody what they're hiding inside from

478.12 --> 482.23
themselves and opens up and they show it

480.4 --> 484.84
then suddenly that person just makes a

482.23 --> 489.58000000000004
lot more sense as what they do how they

484.84 --> 492.36999999999995
are how they conduct themselves and how

489.58 --> 497.95
they came even to certain skills and

492.37 --> 500.85
everything so yeah we'll see where that

497.95 --> 503.74
goes I know one one of those guys

500.85 --> 507.25
definitely will get it because he's a

503.74 --> 509.62
champ and he's always had my back talk

507.25 --> 512.98
to him about flat earth what I do here

509.62 --> 517.0
and he's so cool and open-minded about

512.98 --> 519.87
it like pretty neutral though but it's

517.0 --> 519.87
such a cool guy

521.96 --> 528.1
I just feel good I feel good I feel

524.75 --> 528.1
strong and I feel

534.08 --> 541.74
relieved in a way in a hopeful

538.56 --> 546.2689999999999
and nervous about the future there's so

541.74 --> 549.089
much just still like still that tension

546.269 --> 554.18
that I talked about come moon yeah

549.089 --> 557.339
moving up to that moment to the 82

554.18 --> 564.42
that's real and that's still happening

557.339 --> 568.9200000000001
and I broke that tension in me and other

564.42 --> 571.68
people are no doubtedly doing it to in

568.92 --> 576.05
their own way it's all like this weird

571.68 --> 584.2199999999999
moment barrier we have to break through

576.05 --> 588.209
or be broken by it I don't know how else

584.22 --> 590.73
to explain it it's like a wall of energy

588.209 --> 593.8789999999999
and time and consequences and we've all

590.73 --> 600.389
walked up to it we'll all face it the

593.879 --> 604.019
entire world as as it is and you can

600.389 --> 605.97
only stay behind that wall so long if

604.019 --> 609.259
you want to move on you have to go

605.97 --> 616.4300000000001
through it and with it comes truth and

609.259 --> 616.4300000000001
the consequences of truth and yeah

616.96 --> 622.35
it's happening that is real

625.07 --> 632.0600000000001
and so very ethereal so yeah I don't

628.89 --> 634.47
know the people that get me probably

632.06 --> 637.1099999999999
definitely get this others won't be

634.47 --> 639.47
looking like new are winning wizard

637.11 --> 639.47
stuff

650.6 --> 658.49
so yeah I am open for guests it was kind

653.42 --> 661.0999999999999
of fun yesterday having Jose on and not

658.49 --> 663.95
trying to crack him open over what he

661.1 --> 667.1
did because he knows what he did he

663.95 --> 669.71
knows it I know it and he knows that I

667.1 --> 672.2
know and it's just a stalemate in that

669.71 --> 677.6600000000001
you know Jose wants to be a globe or he

672.2 --> 680.69
wants to do that you know it's one way

677.66 --> 682.42
or the other it's both whatever you're

680.69 --> 685.4200000000001
going to choose once you reach a certain

682.42 --> 685.42
insight

689.61 --> 698.5500000000001
it's like when you choose out of like

694.88 --> 700.92
stress or tension that you think you

698.55 --> 703.1999999999999
can't handle it doesn't really matter

700.92 --> 704.1899999999999
which one you choose if you choose to

703.2 --> 711.8000000000001
hide for it

704.19 --> 714.99
or if you embrace it embrace that truth

711.8 --> 720.3299999999999
because it's gonna have consequences

714.99 --> 722.49
either way and there's really no escape

720.33 --> 726.44
in the end from the truth

722.49 --> 728.9300000000001
it's impossible I think it's even like a

726.44 --> 732.6600000000001
weird

728.93 --> 737.75
ethereal law or something God's law you

732.66 --> 737.75
could call it just

740.15 --> 746.35
it is what it is just seems how it works

748.05 --> 753.28
for every

750.82 --> 756.5500000000001
the ark deed out there there is a

753.28 --> 759.66
response from the light and doesn't

756.55 --> 759.66
really go away

763.58 --> 773.2900000000001
and it will end up meeting the darkness

768.17 --> 773.29
and then negating it

778.48 --> 787.1800000000001
it's anyway I also told myself like yeah

783.76 --> 789.99
I kind of need to stop I know I have

787.18 --> 793.6899999999999
this talent but I kind of need to stop

789.99 --> 795.76
looking there all the time and other

793.69 --> 797.74
people even say this to me it's like

795.76 --> 802.56
they feel like the tension that it

797.74 --> 802.5600000000001
brings doing that and he does and I just

806.399 --> 811.97
I want to do it

808.94 --> 816.58
because I want to do it but at the same

811.97 --> 819.71
time man I I need to also just stand

816.58 --> 826.4200000000001
still for a moment and just smell the

819.71 --> 830.71
flowers in the time that I am here now

826.42 --> 834.74
because it's kind of almost like it's

830.71 --> 835.5500000000001
like this the Star Wars thing you know

834.74 --> 840.44
Yoda

835.55 --> 844.5799999999999
mentioned about about obi-wan Kenobi in

840.44 --> 847.1600000000001
what is it the second the the fourth or

844.58 --> 850.7
the fifth Star Wars did the heavy one

847.16 --> 853.91
with the snow planet and everything when

850.7 --> 856.3100000000001
Luke Skywalker talks about he's talking

853.91 --> 859.28
with Yoda and he just says yeah he's

856.31 --> 862.4899999999999
always been looking into the future

859.28 --> 865.61
staring away never seeing what's right

862.49 --> 869.45
in front of him what he was doing and

865.61 --> 871.64
that's that is something that is

869.45 --> 878.21
something that I also need to learn I

871.64 --> 882.35
think I think because I do tend to just

878.21 --> 885.4000000000001
look away and forget where I am right

882.35 --> 885.4
now right here

887.87 --> 895.1
it's all about balance and yeah I need

893.06 --> 897.38
to stick the D to the word you know I

895.1 --> 900.44
can give everyone all these lessons

897.38 --> 902.3
about balance but if I don't actually do

900.44 --> 905.9000000000001
it myself what is it worth it

902.3 --> 907.91
you know and then what's the power of

905.9 --> 910.18
these words if I can't really do it

907.91 --> 910.18
myself

919.87 --> 925.629
tap balancing on a spinning ball yeah

923.839 --> 929.24
that's tough isn't it

925.629 --> 932.4200000000001
it's like gotta be careful should jump

929.24 --> 934.399
too high you might not land where you

932.42 --> 945.279
jump from ball will be spinning

934.399 --> 945.279
underneath you so they say yeah

945.939 --> 952.129
also I found it kind of remarkable that

948.709 --> 955.0089999999999
I was right before this hangout i hanged

952.129 --> 957.879
out that helio skeptic he had it ultra

955.009 --> 962.87
ultra long and out all night apparently

957.879 --> 967.04
and yeah he actually spoke to me and

962.87 --> 969.17
gave credit to me like he got it thank

967.04 --> 976.43
you thank you Helio sceptic shout-out to

969.17 --> 978.9799999999999
Helia skeptic yeah it was kind of

976.43 --> 981.3499999999999
interesting he played a song and that

978.98 --> 984.769
was just right on target it's a famous

981.35 --> 987.35
song about pain inside and confronting

984.769 --> 994.009
it what's it called again it's really

987.35 --> 994.7900000000001

1003.149 --> 1007.81
number two you can look over there

1006.1 --> 1009.1890000000001
sometimes you know just every once in a

1007.81 --> 1010.63
while kind of take a peek to see if

1009.189 --> 1012.819
somebody's talking to the window and

1010.63 --> 1016.149
number three if you smell the roses that

1016.149 --> 1022.98
eating something a good on you to reveal

1018.569 --> 1022.9799999999999
such a clown sometimes Jose

got anything else to say

1028.08 --> 1034.83
want to talk about something or yeah

1032.39 --> 1036.2700000000002
continue our aisle jumping in like a few

1034.83 --> 1037.98
minutes I'm just eating I just got a

1036.27 --> 1041.16
fork eating a little sandwich before I

1037.98 --> 1043.32
come in I just wanted to save this spot

1041.16 --> 1045.3600000000001

one day we got to make it happy have you

1052.74 --> 1060.74
had them people yet today no but it's

1057.03 --> 1063.81
look it's a weird time for many people

1060.74 --> 1067.71
to do this because yeah in the United

1063.81 --> 1071.7
States very early in England I best I

1067.71 --> 1074.91
bet a lot of people like go to work and

1071.7 --> 1076.95
such and they might listen in but yeah

1074.91 --> 1079.5
they'll be too busy you know it's it's

1076.95 --> 1081.0900000000001
even like the same with chocolate and he

1079.5 --> 1083.58
goes to work really early

1081.09 --> 1085.98
yeah he's if he joins then it's gonna be

1083.58 --> 1088.47
at work and I find that really cool that

1085.98 --> 1091.32
it just does part of the hangout like

1088.47 --> 1096.18
during his job and that's like that's

1091.32 --> 1104.82
cool but yeah don't endanger your job

1096.18 --> 1106.65
just to be part of my hangout if I want

1104.82 --> 1109.1399999999999
a full panel then I'm gonna have to do

1106.65 --> 1111.27
this hangout like for my time yet like

1109.14 --> 1114.1200000000001
at midnight because that's when

1111.27 --> 1115.59
everybody gets home from work in the

1114.12 --> 1118.77
United States that's when everybody

1115.59 --> 1120.24
piles on but there's also yeah other

1118.77 --> 1124.02
people do their own hangouts during

1120.24 --> 1126.2
these time so and then the people don't

1124.02 --> 1129.9
want to jump in because maybe they have

1126.2 --> 1132.14
they have this rage and fury inside I'm

1129.9 --> 1139.6200000000001
the way for Nathan show to let it out

1132.14 --> 1143.8790000000001
right well I don't think so it's it's

1139.62 --> 1146.1589999999999
not the same you know that rage

1143.879 --> 1149.1589999999999
look the whole thing globe and Flat

1146.159 --> 1151.0490000000002
Earth it's really just a battle it's a

1149.159 --> 1157.229
battle of the psyches and it's not

1151.049 --> 1162.749
really raged it's just maybe to some

1157.229 --> 1166.349
people it is rage like man during the

1162.749 --> 1168.3890000000001
year during the debates I got really

1166.349 --> 1172.049
pissed off many times you know I was

1168.389 --> 1174.839
could be very loud and and that's always

1172.049 --> 1179.19
kind of an issue with me with me who I

1174.839 --> 1181.889
am is that and I get passionate I'll

1179.19 --> 1184.8590000000002
raise my voice slightly and I will sound

1181.889 --> 1186.389
angry I guess even when I hear it back

1184.859 --> 1193.349
it's like oh my god I sound so angry

1186.389 --> 1198.5089999999998
well I'm not really angry I'm just you

1193.349 --> 1203.879
know I'm just I'm just very serious and

1198.509 --> 1204.749
energetic and but you know I've had some

1203.879 --> 1206.9689999999998
good ones

1204.749 --> 1209.999
yeah yeah I've had some good ones become

1206.969 --> 1212.969
fourth with Riley about gravity a few

1209.999 --> 1217.109
months ago that was classic yeah that's

1212.969 --> 1219.5990000000002
that was something it was tough though

1217.109 --> 1223.9489999999998
yeah I found a middle ground it's good

1219.599 --> 1225.839
now you guys have found a middle ground

1223.949 --> 1228.299
you know it's gonna be this kind of a

1225.839 --> 1230.94
little you know poke but you guys found

1228.299 --> 1234.749
a good middle ground not to argue very

1230.94 --> 1238.409
personal about it that's good well we

1234.749 --> 1242.099
came to an agreement on what the

1238.409 --> 1244.709
confines of it all is and I hope I think

1242.099 --> 1249.359
that my conceptualization of the

1244.709 --> 1252.179
aberration aspect really helped it's

1249.359 --> 1255.059
like it confines the whole issue and

1252.179 --> 1258.299
defines it but still yeah it definitely

1255.059 --> 1261.44
leaves open like yeah but what about all

1258.299 --> 1266.039
these things outside of that and

1261.44 --> 1269.429
basically stating yeah we got this it

1266.039 --> 1272.98
works but there is so much unanswered

1269.429 --> 1275.0800000000002
outside of that and without really

1272.98 --> 1279.64
direct idea on how to even approach it

1275.08 --> 1282.28
but at least it it shows that it's there

1279.64 --> 1283.1200000000001
that there's more out there that we

1282.28 --> 1289.1499999999999
can't explain

1283.12 --> 1293.11
really and we may never be able to you

1289.15 --> 1294.97
know not oh who knows maybe we will

1293.11 --> 1298.9599999999998
eventually at some point but at this

1294.97 --> 1301.69
point on what we've been doing so far no

1298.96 --> 1304.63
it's just it's just impossible you know

1301.69 --> 1307.69
you can speculate you can presuppose all

1304.63 --> 1310.2990000000002
these things but what is within that

1307.69 --> 1315.01
confine of gravity and the aberrations

1310.299 --> 1317.86
and that is what it is and it works but

1315.01 --> 1321.49
there's still more outside of that and I

1317.86 --> 1327.4289999999999
have no idea on how to deal with that

1321.49 --> 1330.07
how to continue moving beyond it yeah we

1327.429 --> 1332.71
all have we all have an opinion on

1330.07 --> 1334.87
different subjects coming all rounding

1332.71 --> 1336.8500000000001
about the the flutters you know rauner

1334.87 --> 1340.09
whatever but we all have this little

1336.85 --> 1343.6299999999999
list that we like have a bigger voice

1340.09 --> 1346.6599999999999
and wanted precent more more of it like

1343.63 --> 1348.3400000000001
you you get you get something clicks on

1346.66 --> 1350.559
you when you Robbie to get mentioned and

1348.34 --> 1352.059
I know you you each sometimes to say

1350.559 --> 1354.1299999999999
something but you just let it roll and

1352.059 --> 1357.25
kind of little slide I can feel it you

1354.13 --> 1359.71
know same with me now now me my trigger

1357.25 --> 1363.13
is perspective and and the obstruction

1359.71 --> 1364.3500000000001
and all that kind of [ __ ] yeah you

1363.13 --> 1366.88
gotta do it yeah right

1364.35 --> 1369.2099999999998
that's the issue you look when you go

1366.88 --> 1374.3500000000001
back to the globe then that is the main

1369.21 --> 1376.99
thing and this is gonna sound weird but

1374.35 --> 1380.62
as you are psychologically where you are

1376.99 --> 1383.679
right now look you were on the other

1380.62 --> 1385.51
side we know you were you can deny it

1383.679 --> 1387.73
all you want it doesn't really matter

1385.51 --> 1389.89
anymore we've seen it and now that

1387.73 --> 1391.78
you're on the other side again you had

1389.89 --> 1393.7900000000002
it bring some benefits it may bring some

1391.78 --> 1397.799
peace of mind it makes things simpler

1393.79 --> 1401.53
and I get that but yeah this obstacle

1397.799 --> 1405.16
then it's

1401.53 --> 1407.59
oh you say unsurmountable and that's the

1405.16 --> 1411.4
thing as a globe or its unsurmountable

1407.59 --> 1416.4099999999999
you can't overcome it and we know why

1411.4 --> 1424.48
and you can't know why because it's part

1416.41 --> 1425.3500000000001
of the globe religion it can't say it

1424.48 --> 1428.92
any other way

1425.35 --> 1429.8799999999999
I hear you I respect your opinion yes

1428.92 --> 1432.5500000000002
all right

1429.88 --> 1434.68
but the thing is about the day we all

1432.55 --> 1436.09
have a little trigger something you get

1434.68 --> 1437.8
triggered with gravity how to get

1436.09 --> 1439.6599999999999
triggered now with freaking obstruction

1437.8 --> 1442.84
who else I think

1439.66 --> 1444.52
Riley's get triggered with the besides

1442.84 --> 1446.08
gravity with the gas pressure without a

1444.52 --> 1447.94
container will get a little nice you

1446.08 --> 1450.6999999999998
know how it is no that's another one

1447.94 --> 1456.55
yeah but look my whole trigger with

1450.7 --> 1458.2
gravity was is that I didn't know it was

1456.55 --> 1461.98
an aberration at first and I just

1458.2 --> 1467.26
thought no there is so much to it there

1461.98 --> 1470.5
must be a way to get it proven without

1467.26 --> 1473.44
getting on the whole Cavendish globe

1470.5 --> 1476.23
approach to it so I tried to separate it

1473.44 --> 1478.45
and just figure it out and I did I did

1476.23 --> 1483.18
very very well I'm still very proud of

1478.45 --> 1486.73
everything I said in my attempts to get

1483.18 --> 1488.89
actual proof for gravity and then I

1486.73 --> 1491.47
figure it out yeah it's not really

1488.89 --> 1494.8300000000002
possible unfortunately it was very

1491.47 --> 1497.2
bitter realization because I loved it I

1494.83 --> 1500.11
thought like yeah I'm gonna be the one

1497.2 --> 1505.06
I'm gonna be the one to actually prove

1500.11 --> 1507.6
it where others drop the ball drop the

1505.06 --> 1507.6
ball my god

1513.66 --> 1519.3300000000002
but it wasn't really meant to be and I

1515.67 --> 1524.97
learned a lot from it and there's more

1519.33 --> 1526.1699999999998
to be done but for now we yeah there's

1524.97 --> 1528.48
no time for it yet

1526.17 --> 1531.8400000000001
although yeah it this seems to be the

1528.48 --> 1533.97
time of optics this is the time where we

1531.84 --> 1537.05
dive into optics I've already shared

1533.97 --> 1540.41
this with with the rest of the crew

1537.05 --> 1543.69
Riley ranty Nathan basically said yeah

1540.41 --> 1546.75
we have all these fields were working on

1543.69 --> 1550.14
but the optics one that is where there

1546.75 --> 1554.34
is so much ground again so much to learn

1550.14 --> 1557.5800000000002
so much the master and this life is

1554.34 --> 1559.8899999999999
short guy who comes on Randy

1557.58 --> 1564.12
Randy's with these amazing presentations

1559.89 --> 1567.0
Jesus huge massive super long hangout

1564.12 --> 1569.28
yesterday I I didn't even see it oh I

1567.0 --> 1573.36
just bumped in there's like wow it's

1569.28 --> 1575.85
actually going that long because I was I

1573.36 --> 1578.34
I thought I saw the post on the Skype

1575.85 --> 1580.56
and I click on it while I was working

1578.34 --> 1582.12
last night but I was listening and

1580.56 --> 1584.07
listening because I couldn't be watching

1582.12 --> 1585.54
you know and every time I while I pulled

1584.07 --> 1587.49
the phone to see the graphics because I

1585.54 --> 1590.46
said you can look at here this graphic

1587.49 --> 1592.68
at this image and and I stopped in like

1590.46 --> 1597.54
two hours it was too long so I decided a

1592.68 --> 1599.52
little bit tough no I finish it yeah and

1597.54 --> 1603.45
everybody goes through it in their own

1599.52 --> 1606.48
tempo like I can even say like yeah it's

1603.45 --> 1609.0
kind of too much for me I'm just looking

1606.48 --> 1611.28
at it from a distance and just slowly

1609.0 --> 1615.36
getting the feel for it because I feel

1611.28 --> 1619.1299999999999
my god this is really complex it's what

1615.36 --> 1622.02
these guys usually gets the mounted data

1619.13 --> 1624.24
hmm who is that guy

1622.02 --> 1626.48
oh yeah who was that guy no it was Randy

1624.24 --> 1629.19
increase and then Nathan joined I think

1626.48 --> 1630.96
when I just checked out but there was a

1629.19 --> 1633.39
guy doing the main presentation and

1630.96 --> 1636.27
that's why in short the guy was like for

1633.39 --> 1640.1100000000001
sure I don't know how they came stumble

1636.27 --> 1642.3
down to him but I haven't even maybe

1640.11 --> 1644.82
Yves even told exactly his background

1642.3 --> 1649.36
but it feels like he is

1644.82 --> 1651.6699999999998
an optics scientist somebody that has

1649.36 --> 1653.53
specialized absolutely in detail in

1651.67 --> 1658.1200000000001
optics because he just know so much

1653.53 --> 1660.04
about it he can't not be an optic

1658.12 --> 1664.4199999999998
scientists and know this much and have

1660.04 --> 1665.86
that much grip okay I appreciated Dave

1664.42 --> 1668.28
I appreciate the part of the

1665.86 --> 1670.99
presentation when because he was

1668.28 --> 1673.27
presenting facts about this is the

1670.99 --> 1676.66
whatever the number on the distraction

1673.27 --> 1680.29
and this is the way this is how the lens

1676.66 --> 1682.48
work and just Dave presenting the

1680.29 --> 1685.18
presenting the evidence it was good but

1682.48 --> 1686.8600000000001
then he in the interpretation part it's

1685.18 --> 1690.28
what I kind of zoned out you know

1686.86 --> 1692.59
because if I say oh this is a cigarette

1690.28 --> 1695.11
right here and he said we got a paper

1692.59 --> 1697.84
having that grass in it and you smoke it

1695.11 --> 1699.79
that's good but then I say and why do

1697.84 --> 1701.8
you smoke it you smoke it because he's

1699.79 --> 1702.1599999999999
good for your health or is bad for your

1701.8 --> 1703.81
health

1702.16 --> 1705.8200000000002
and then the I give you the expiration

1703.81 --> 1707.1699999999998
on why people smoke it ro interested in

1705.82 --> 1709.1499999999999
that how interested and this is a

1707.17 --> 1710.8300000000002
cigarette so I was interested in his

1709.15 --> 1713.17
presentation and the car that he was

1710.83 --> 1714.9099999999999
presenting some facts about optics and I

1713.17 --> 1716.8000000000002
can appreciate that and then on the

1714.91 --> 1718.69
interpretation that's what I you know

1716.8 --> 1721.6
people have to discern if he's like it

1718.69 --> 1723.43
is wrong if he you know either way other

1721.6 --> 1726.82
review understand what I mean now I know

1723.43 --> 1729.1000000000001
exactly what you mean yeah so that's

1726.82 --> 1731.3799999999999
good that's why I see every content I

1729.1 --> 1732.85
mean I used to watch all the content

1731.38 --> 1735.8200000000002
because there's always information

1732.85 --> 1738.3999999999999
through information but they always the

1735.82 --> 1740.58
interpretation part is what I get from

1738.4 --> 1747.43
beauty you know and it's yeah it's on

1740.58 --> 1749.98
individuality everybody takes in

1747.43 --> 1753.88
information at their own pace in their

1749.98 --> 1755.95
own time and everybody decides when

1753.88 --> 1758.66
they've had enough and they walk away

1755.95 --> 1762.049
and they might walk back

1758.66 --> 1767.8300000000002
when they feel they must because they're

1762.049 --> 1767.83
stuck and they need to move but yeah

1769.24 --> 1780.58
yes indeed I'm gonna go hang out later

1776.919 --> 1783.3700000000001
with it Opel Puerto Rican couple because

1780.58 --> 1787.9189999999999
we don't go out often hear me my wife we

1783.37 --> 1791.3799999999999
went out on Christmas Day a co-worker a

1787.919 --> 1793.24
co-worker the world through my wife she

1791.38 --> 1794.71
calling Christmas Day early to say I

1793.24 --> 1796.059
invited a bunch of people that nobody's

1794.71 --> 1798.25
coming do you wanna come home you know

1796.059 --> 1799.72
just to hang out and eat food so you

1798.25 --> 1802.96
husband can meet my husband

1799.72 --> 1805.6000000000001
and she invited to say yes and then she

1802.96 --> 1807.309
came to me after yeah I'll go and they

1805.6 --> 1809.4089999999999
are like very rich people you know they

1807.309 --> 1811.33
had this big mansion and he got a bigger

1809.409 --> 1813.64
drone you know sitting on the table and

1811.33 --> 1815.74
they were very high class you know and

1813.64 --> 1819.3400000000001
we are the total opposite we're like

1815.74 --> 1822.429
really poor and and very slang talk you

1819.34 --> 1825.4289999999999
know and they were very refined but we

1822.429 --> 1827.77
it was such a good chemic chemical

1825.429 --> 1829.75
chemical between us you know we would

1827.77 --> 1831.61
take the four of us and we had such a

1829.75 --> 1833.289
good interaction and we're gonna go hang

1831.61 --> 1835.6899999999998
out with them today because they know

1833.289 --> 1837.34
we're gonna leave to Florida in probably

1835.69 --> 1839.169
about a month and he wanted to hang out

1837.34 --> 1840.6689999999999
with them a little a little bit before

1839.169 --> 1842.6200000000001
we go so it's cool yeah I'm looking

1840.669 --> 1846.49
forward for a few hours from now I got

1842.62 --> 1850.27
with them so how do you know about them

1846.49 --> 1853.8990000000001
like what is what has made them so

1850.27 --> 1857.11
wealthy it's kind of you know what

1977.63 --> 1986.0200000000002
you man I just wanna say be careful

1981.19 --> 1986.02
enjoy be aware because

1987.81 --> 1991.25
as Jesus said

1992.12 --> 1996.7489999999998
you know

1993.96 --> 1999.72
well yeah I'll bet it so where's wealth

1996.749 --> 2003.83
there's danger and yeah I don't always

1999.72 --> 2006.1100000000001
see it in front so be wary just yeah

2003.83 --> 2008.21
just be wary that's all I'm not telling

2006.11 --> 2011.09
you all they're all evil hiding [ __ ]

2008.21 --> 2013.07
they could be they could be and you need

2011.09 --> 2016.1
to be wary you have kids okay

2013.07 --> 2018.499
be wary yeah always

2016.1 --> 2021.4089999999999
I got a good vibe yeah they had a good

2018.499 --> 2022.519
bag they're like not not Christian they

2021.409 --> 2024.769
don't talk about free time but they

2022.519 --> 2026.99
didn't swear or nothing every time I say

2024.769 --> 2029.32
like and oh this [ __ ] or

2026.99 --> 2032.059
something in Spanish what are we gotta

2029.32 --> 2033.799
bail out I say I'm sorry I'm sorry about

2032.059 --> 2035.99
this we're in the faithful we haven't

2033.799 --> 2038.09
heard we haven't heard you you know

2035.99 --> 2039.71
you're tired the way you people are

2038.09 --> 2041.09
Rican people talk for real in a long

2039.71 --> 2041.45
time because they'd be here for like ten

2041.09 --> 2043.49
years

2041.45 --> 2046.309
and they hang out with kind of their own

2043.49 --> 2048.859
circle and they all very well-spoken

2046.309 --> 2052.129
and I'm like okay we my slang us

2048.859 --> 2053.839
hilarious yeah but um I've always I'm

2052.129 --> 2057.98
always very aware in defense mode

2053.839 --> 2060.23
always all right because yeah

2057.98 --> 2063.01
appearances can be kind of deceiving in

2060.23 --> 2063.01
that okay

2064.15 --> 2072.67
don't wanna scare the living [ __ ] out of

2066.91 --> 2077.89
people but like the Jesuit guy you know

2072.67 --> 2081.06
he seemed to be ultra nice as well and

2077.89 --> 2083.5299999999997
from a really civilized family with just

2081.06 --> 2088.59
intellectual people and responsible

2083.53 --> 2092.4700000000003
people as well you don't really know

2088.59 --> 2095.65
until anybody artist reaches out from

2092.47 --> 2097.75
within them yeah if there's a third

2095.65 --> 2099.13
person that don't know let's say me and

2097.75 --> 2101.41
him are standing in the front of the

2099.13 --> 2105.34
house and they look at her they say holy

2101.41 --> 2107.47
[ __ ] who's that will hold ki with the

2105.34 --> 2109.57
beard he looks like creepy and the other

2107.47 --> 2112.8399999999997
guy looks really clean which it's true

2109.57 --> 2115.3
by [ __ ] was but I know I know how I am

2112.84 --> 2117.46
and like cold you know cool guy you know

2115.3 --> 2120.61
just get along and the only one might be

2117.46 --> 2123.67
just a weird the psycho you know so yeah

2120.61 --> 2128.52
people by appearances people can never

2123.67 --> 2131.35
know well it's not as much about

2128.52 --> 2135.04
appearances as it is about the energy

2131.35 --> 2138.99
they wield because you can have a total

2135.04 --> 2142.06
weirdo freaky looking guy that's just

2138.99 --> 2144.4599999999996
just a great person and just like

2142.06 --> 2146.5
they're just clowning basically with

2144.46 --> 2149.56
their appearance and there's people that

2146.5 --> 2153.55
look ultra normal but they are like the

2149.56 --> 2156.49
devil and they radiate that so yeah you

2153.55 --> 2160.51
don't appearances can be deceiving just

2156.49 --> 2164.41
saying be careful man you know if you

2160.51 --> 2167.8
were very you were in a way maybe still

2164.41 --> 2171.3399999999997
are kind of close to me and I don't want

2167.8 --> 2174.13
to see you end up getting in some kind

2171.34 --> 2177.19
of Hell by accident you know indeed I

2174.13 --> 2180.1600000000003
agree appreciate it yeah for real

2177.19 --> 2182.05
I am Boyd I avoid any any

2180.16 --> 2183.3999999999996
misunderstanding or negativity

2182.05 --> 2185.71
whatsoever

2183.4 --> 2187.48
I mean at least personal over the

2185.71 --> 2189.1
Internet we always have arguments and

2187.48 --> 2191.53
[ __ ] but that's something of God in the

2189.1 --> 2194.14
personal you know label oh yeah I'm

2191.53 --> 2197.6000000000004
always very self aware and defensive

2194.14 --> 2200.33
about what I do is myself I damaged my

2197.6 --> 2205.58
so I don't want nobody to get damaged or

2200.33 --> 2209.38
damaged me you know okay all right yeah

2205.58 --> 2213.38
good to hear anyway having fun and I

2209.38 --> 2215.9
also had a bit of a question though it

2213.38 --> 2219.53
is kind of personal so if you don't want

2215.9 --> 2222.4700000000003
to go there then I understand but like

2219.53 --> 2226.3700000000003
me and some other flat earthers had like

2222.47 --> 2229.6099999999997
the real sense that you basically

2226.37 --> 2235.73
switched because there was pressure from

2229.61 --> 2239.9300000000003
the lady at home and how is that going

2235.73 --> 2242.57
is it because we thought like it's

2239.93 --> 2246.47
because you are kind of getting obsessed

2242.57 --> 2249.32
with the Flat Earth debates and and but

2246.47 --> 2251.0
in the same way it seems like yeah you

2249.32 --> 2252.9500000000003
haven't really walked away you just

2251.0 --> 2257.62
joined the other side the global side

2252.95 --> 2262.39
and that is she okay with that

2257.62 --> 2266.6
you know what impart you're right and

2262.39 --> 2269.24
you can feel that I having I have been

2266.6 --> 2271.67
participating maybe almost the same

2269.24 --> 2275.2099999999996
amount I was on the other side so how

2271.67 --> 2277.01
did you feel about it hey it doesn't she

2275.21 --> 2278.75
doesn't feel it because these times that

2277.01 --> 2281.03
are you in your show or the flooded

2278.75 --> 2282.89
debate and maybe the vegan goes show up

2281.03 --> 2286.1000000000004
that does defines this world in she

2282.89 --> 2288.3799999999997
works she works the day shift you know

2286.1 --> 2291.89
she would she start work like three

2288.38 --> 2294.11
hours ago she come home maybe by the

2291.89 --> 2296.72
second show on the flooded debate is

2294.11 --> 2299.75

2303.83 --> 2306.98
tried to go in and sorghum physically a

2305.63 --> 2309.83
little bit now when she comes back home

2306.98 --> 2312.32
in the afternoon I totally check out now

2309.83 --> 2314.9
later in the night before I go to work a

2312.32 --> 2316.2200000000003
couple hours then I'll we seem you know

2314.9 --> 2317.48
in the living room and she's talking in

2316.22 --> 2319.2799999999997

2317.48 --> 2321.83
games on the phone and I tell ya I'm

2319.28 --> 2323.6000000000004
gonna be just browse around the day the

2321.83 --> 2326.42
flatter YouTube she said I can do it you

2323.6 --> 2328.4
know and and in school you know not like

2326.42 --> 2330.5
before before what the difference was I

2328.4 --> 2331.369
was always in the show I didn't care if

2330.5 --> 2333.23
she was home

2331.369 --> 2337.9990000000003
lunch I was always in there in the

2333.23 --> 2340.279
debate yes and in every every single

2337.999 --> 2342.47
hour after that I was researching and

2340.279 --> 2344.18
looking videos videos videos non-stop

2342.47 --> 2346.1899999999996
while she was here she was doing and I

2344.18 --> 2348.14
was mostly outside just smoking

2346.19 --> 2349.9700000000003
cigarettes and looking fluttered I was

2348.14 --> 2352.4
inside next to her and I was looking at

2349.97 --> 2354.4399999999996
videos cluttered and looking for PDF and

2352.4 --> 2357.259
books and reading him trying to come up

2354.44 --> 2358.5190000000002
with ideas and doing little drawings on

2357.259 --> 2360.68
paper she so what you do when I'm

2358.519 --> 2362.6899999999996
drawing just lines when I show her he

2360.68 --> 2364.16
was always like life in the streets and

2362.69 --> 2365.809
perspective on buildings and sheep

2364.16 --> 2368.509
trying to figure out something to come

2365.809 --> 2370.67
up with a new idea and I was like too

2368.509 --> 2372.44
involved right now I do in the chose was

2370.67 --> 2374.869
just a world when she's home I just

2372.44 --> 2377.4500000000003
check out for most of the time you know

2374.869 --> 2379.069
so it's working good little bi mirror I

2377.45 --> 2380.8089999999997
started you know kicking it off a little

2379.069 --> 2382.849
bit to the side I will still do

2380.809 --> 2385.13
observations I love it so that's gonna

2382.849 --> 2386.839
be my thing just record and take my

2385.13 --> 2389.1800000000003
little time to do a little video and

2386.839 --> 2392.72
uploading and answering comments and

2389.18 --> 2394.759
stuff right okay yeah but if I help

2392.72 --> 2400.009
maybe go a bit of a balance there then

2394.759 --> 2402.17
at least now I tell her I've been

2400.009 --> 2404.93
talking to her teeth alike like you're

2402.17 --> 2406.849
crazy they must be hating yes I know not

2404.93 --> 2408.799
really I mean yes but no I explained her

2406.849 --> 2411.4700000000003
you know the interaction how it's being

2408.799 --> 2414.769
progressing since since I decided to

2411.47 --> 2416.749
change and she said I then all that [ __ ]

2414.769 --> 2419.269
that you told me about flattered is is

2416.749 --> 2421.999
it's not true I said no no no no no no

2419.269 --> 2423.859
you you know chief a cheat on me I

2421.999 --> 2425.9889999999996
haven't tell you what I believe what I

2423.859 --> 2427.46
know I mean what I want my friends from

2425.989 --> 2429.7690000000002
the church on the earth is on what I

2427.46 --> 2431.45
feel I say I'm really don't wanna hear

2429.769 --> 2433.999
about it I don't wanna talk about it

2431.45 --> 2436.819
with you because I know I got my feel if

2433.999 --> 2439.1299999999997
I got my truth about what I feel about

2436.819 --> 2440.48
Christianity and about the earth about

2439.13 --> 2442.2490000000003
science and all that see that's why I

2440.48 --> 2444.7690000000002
appreciate it but then I show her

2442.249 --> 2446.2099999999996
something and she said like I don't know

2444.769 --> 2449.93
it might be a different explanation

2446.21 --> 2451.73
she's very very smart very aware but the

2449.93 --> 2454.009
smartest thing she's doing she haven't

2451.73 --> 2454.5190000000002
told me her position and I really don't

2454.009 --> 2457.7
want to know it

2454.519 --> 2461.0299999999997
yeah he's good I'll be careful dude you

2457.7 --> 2464.87
may end up just bumping into your

2461.03 --> 2470.17
on the flatter side right I know I'm

2464.87 --> 2470.17
telling you man yeah what are you doing

2470.8 --> 2479.0600000000004
now yeah this is fun subject I never

2477.5 --> 2481.58
thought about talking about these

2479.06 --> 2483.68
science and all these optics and all

2481.58 --> 2486.5299999999997
this kind of [ __ ] God since I found it a

2483.68 --> 2489.2599999999998
few years ago I got in like really deep

2486.53 --> 2491.1200000000003
man I'm really leaving I stay like I'm

2489.26 --> 2493.4900000000002
still really deep into flutter because I

2491.12 --> 2495.89
cannot drop it as for right now am i

2493.49 --> 2498.62
arguing from the other side now because

2495.89 --> 2503.2
of just a little bit of evidence that I

2498.62 --> 2505.46
found is too strong for me yeah but I

2503.2 --> 2509.12
don't see anything wrong with it I think

2505.46 --> 2513.05
it's good to have this opposite point of

2509.12 --> 2515.2999999999997
view presenting it in the I'm going into

2513.05 --> 2517.7000000000003
the wolf's cave you know just a little

2515.3 --> 2520.4500000000003
lamb going into the wolf cape arguing

2517.7 --> 2523.43
you know from from myself because

2520.45 --> 2526.2799999999997
nobody's trying to feed to feed me what

2523.43 --> 2528.5899999999997
I have to say nobody wants to adopt me

2526.28 --> 2531.6800000000003
as part of them their group I'm alone

2528.59 --> 2533.2400000000002
I'm along with brawn I love it I [ __ ] in

2531.68 --> 2537.5
love and believe me all these arguments

2533.24 --> 2540.7599999999998
or my all all my interactions are my own

2537.5 --> 2543.95
thoughts my own feelings you know do I

2540.76 --> 2546.8900000000003
maybe you think coming if somebody

2543.95 --> 2548.6
thinks I'm trying to mimic or being fed

2546.89 --> 2550.79
by somebody you're totally wrong because

2548.6 --> 2553.0099999999998
you can see how weak my arguments are

2550.79 --> 2555.05
because it's just mine my own you know

2553.01 --> 2556.73
this is my own thing and I like it I

2555.05 --> 2558.6200000000003

2712.02 --> 2718.17
right it's good I'm kind of agreeing in

2715.47 --> 2719.97
that look I'm trying to calm down still

2718.17 --> 2722.78
in that process and doing much much

2719.97 --> 2728.3999999999996
better it's blatantly obvious I think

2722.78 --> 2729.599
but yeah I appreciate just not doing the

2728.4 --> 2732.9
heavy [ __ ] so much

2729.599 --> 2734.579
oh no I agree yeah everything he told

2732.9 --> 2736.44
the plaintiff all the places for daddy I

2734.579 --> 2741.0890000000004
this slavery guys that I'm in a place

2736.44 --> 2743.79
and the time was there it came out no

2741.089 --> 2746.25
need to just cool down a bit and

2743.79 --> 2749.21
reserved myself and just see where it

2746.25 --> 2749.21
where it goes from here

2749.93 --> 2755.24
agreed Hey I didn't I did a new video

2752.87 --> 2756.8599999999997
yesterday check it out later

2755.24 --> 2758.5699999999997
why don't you got time it's a little

2756.86 --> 2760.67
long I don't know if like seven minutes

2758.57 --> 2762.05
or 30 minutes is our angle of attack

2760.67 --> 2766.55
video I did it yesterday

2762.05 --> 2768.9500000000003
again we replicated it with the light

2766.55 --> 2771.0800000000004
and the floor and the supermarket so I

2768.95 --> 2773.99
just the same spot exactly I did it

2771.08 --> 2776.39
before I put the flashlight I went to

2773.99 --> 2778.04
the other side I couldn't do the laser I

2776.39 --> 2780.98
had a the little dollar laser try to

2778.04 --> 2782.66
point it what I tried it last week just

2780.98 --> 2785.48
manually without recording and it's so

2782.66 --> 2787.04
difficult to point I need very precise

2785.48 --> 2788.51
so I couldn't do it because it was in

2787.04 --> 2790.2799999999997
the middle of the ship I told the boss

2788.51 --> 2791.84
like a I need to take a five minute I

2790.28 --> 2792.4700000000003
need to do a little something go let me

2791.84 --> 2796.46
do it

2792.47 --> 2798.14
so I put the light I did the open down

2796.46 --> 2799.67
on the light and I could see in the

2798.14 --> 2802.73
camera I should the light was

2799.67 --> 2804.98
disappearing so if having a c4 i

2802.73 --> 2808.7
replicate it it really good yeah I know

2804.98 --> 2811.79
then and yeah yeah

2808.7 --> 2815.7999999999997
I choose problem psychological with you

2811.79 --> 2818.27
yeah yeah your inability to grasp it

2815.8 --> 2820.52
basically yes sorry I'm not gonna even

2818.27 --> 2822.86
push it like we'll leave that for the

2820.52 --> 2826.52
debates okay I'll leave Nathan to Ram

2822.86 --> 2827.1800000000003
that but I just want to walk you through

2826.52 --> 2830.69
what I did

2827.18 --> 2833.39
different in this time once I do hold on

2830.69 --> 2836.3
one thing I do kind of appreciate with

2833.39 --> 2842.69
you is that at least you're not trying

2836.3 --> 2844.13
to hide it and oh dude it [ __ ] and then

2842.69 --> 2846.53
when it doesn't work out how they

2844.13 --> 2850.04
expected they just don't talk about it

2846.53 --> 2851.6000000000004
they don't show it big yeah you're just

2850.04 --> 2854.09
putting it out there and just saying I

2851.6 --> 2856.96
don't get it and yeah that's that's

2854.09 --> 2858.77
better in my opinion

2856.96 --> 2860.48
so the first fault

2858.77 --> 2862.34
I choose exactly the same thought and he

2860.48 --> 2865.19
happen exactly as it happened before I

2862.34 --> 2867.5
choose the other side on the store where

2865.19 --> 2869.63
I did it on all the time and I think

2867.5 --> 2871.88
they like disappeared also they saw the

2869.63 --> 2873.83
same then I choose a different totally

2871.88 --> 2877.9700000000003
different angle of across the aisle and

2873.83 --> 2880.2799999999997
I put the light and it was a tiny bit of

2877.97 --> 2881.93
a shorter distance they like didn't

2880.28 --> 2883.76
disappear in that one and I brought it

2881.93 --> 2886.52
up and down and not

2883.76 --> 2889.2200000000003
and then I decided to go to the back in

2886.52 --> 2891.53
the receiving area where the floor is

2889.22 --> 2893.359
not reflective because this flooring

2891.53 --> 2895.0400000000004
their actual supermarket have like tiles

2893.359 --> 2897.47
and you can see the light you know all

2895.04 --> 2899.93
the stuff so in the receiving part is

2897.47 --> 2901.5499999999997
just like a concrete concrete floor and

2899.93 --> 2903.89
I put the light and I went in the other

2901.55 --> 2905.1800000000003
side and I I don't think the light

2903.89 --> 2906.77
disappeared I didn't even review the

2905.18 --> 2909.0789999999997
video I just did it looking through

2906.77 --> 2911.18
their little phone and then I walk away

2909.079 --> 2913.4300000000003
and I was able to put the light further

2911.18 --> 2915.2599999999998
away so it was corner to corner it was

2913.43 --> 2917.5989999999997
the further spot that I found in the

2915.26 --> 2919.7900000000004
store wall-to-wall in the supermarket

2917.599 --> 2922.67
inside the supermarket it was a short

2919.79 --> 2925.069
distance versus receiving that it had a

2922.67 --> 2926.569
longer wing in the site you know so I

2925.069 --> 2928.97
was able to put a really far and I don't

2926.569 --> 2930.71
think the light disappearing that cheery

2928.97 --> 2934.1299999999997
be because of the reflectivity on the

2930.71 --> 2935.9
floor I'm not sure you know so I just

2934.13 --> 2937.94
uploaded the video on cut the whole

2935.9 --> 2939.589
thing and I put it up there you know so

2937.94 --> 2940.94
yes boom some people have given me some

2939.589 --> 2942.589
feedback I appreciate it just give me

2940.94 --> 2944.839
some feedback and tell me if I do

2942.589 --> 2947.06
something wrong or right and appreciated

2944.839 --> 2950.569
it is what it is and it's gonna yield

2947.06 --> 2952.5789999999997
the result that it will yeah and we can

2950.569 --> 2954.5299999999997
pretty much even on the flatter side now

2952.579 --> 2956.96
predict in detail what is actually

2954.53 --> 2959.5400000000004
happening and we have been and you know

2956.96 --> 2961.91
it's very hard every time talk about it

2959.54 --> 2964.97
to let that sink in and adjust to you

2961.91 --> 2969.56
you've stated very clearly like it

2964.97 --> 2972.56
doesn't make sense to me but that

2969.56 --> 2974.569
doesn't mean it doesn't make sense it

2972.56 --> 2977.75
just means it doesn't make sense to you

2974.569 --> 2982.13
in other yeah yeah yeah you're not

2977.75 --> 2983.839
getting it and yeah that's what I like

2982.13 --> 2985.849
about this subject that is there is the

2983.839 --> 2987.95
truth you know which is the truth and we

2985.849 --> 2991.1600000000003
all have our opinion on it you know and

2987.95 --> 2993.0789999999997
many people join on the same opinion

2991.16 --> 2995.0
many people defer of the opinion have a

2993.079 --> 2997.6400000000003
different little tweak and we all have

2995.0 --> 3001.21
our own opinion a nice okay after you

2997.64 --> 3003.43
say this is a war an ongoing war is the

3001.21 --> 3006.2400000000002
battle is never gonna end but the war

3003.43 --> 3009.8489999999997
will continue forever and ever I think

3006.24 --> 3012.27
hmm okay I'm now being seduced for a

3009.849 --> 3012.27
moment

3012.589 --> 3022.999

people and I've had a lot of people

3138.96 --> 3145.68
adding me on skype a lot but I don't

3143.34 --> 3147.54
really know with each one of them who

3145.68 --> 3151.02
they really are so it's like I have a

3147.54 --> 3153.24
huge pile of people now and yeah that

3151.02 --> 3155.58
I'm like oh yeah maybe I could get you

3153.24 --> 3157.1699999999996
on but we don't talk too much

3155.58 --> 3162.9
and I don't really know them all that

3157.17 --> 3164.55
well so but maybe I should have you know

3162.9 --> 3166.89
what I'll try that tomorrow if I

3164.55 --> 3170.73
remember if nothing comes up in between

3166.89 --> 3175.83
that will dominate the next hangout but

3170.73 --> 3179.46
I will I think

3175.83 --> 3183.6
just try to send some new people links

3179.46 --> 3186.03
and see if they'll join but yeah to all

3183.6 --> 3187.83
those that have added me on skype and we

3186.03 --> 3194.88
do want to be a part of it do realize

3187.83 --> 3196.44
it's gonna be early okay so at least

3194.88 --> 3200.01
it's gonna be early for anyone in the

3196.44 --> 3205.11
United States and in the early afternoon

3200.01 --> 3206.94
for anyone in Europe but yeah I'd love

3205.11 --> 3210.05
to have some more guests on but it's

3206.94 --> 3210.05
it's up to you mostly

3212.57 --> 3217.56
no Nathan Oakley you're watching my ad

3215.64 --> 3221.79
is there an ad playing I can't see that

3217.56 --> 3223.65
eye it's only in retrospect after the

3221.79 --> 3226.08
videos all uploaded and everything that

3223.65 --> 3228.84
all the advertisements getting in there

3226.08 --> 3232.62
and my god YouTube's really piling it in

3228.84 --> 3235.3500000000004
there like insane it's like whoa really

3232.62 --> 3237.66
every four minutes or something it's

3235.35 --> 3240.87
weird but that's what it chooses to do

3237.66 --> 3243.12
all by itself I've no say over that like

3240.87 --> 3245.64
I wanted originally to just have some

3243.12 --> 3248.25
basic advertisement spread out like

3245.64 --> 3251.0099999999998
starting at 10 minutes and then between

3248.25 --> 3253.5
those 10 minutes and the end in between

3251.01 --> 3256.92
one which would be at like 45 minutes 40

3253.5 --> 3263.49
minutes or something but yeah man it is

3256.92 --> 3267.03
just like yeah that's okay okay you know

3263.49 --> 3271.43
I don't know why they're so hungry about

3267.03 --> 3274.3500000000004
this since I only have like what is it

3271.43 --> 3276.8399999999997
thousand fifty-five subs it's kind of

3274.35 --> 3279.5
odd let's see let's see where my

3276.84 --> 3284.4
subscribers are at the moment

3279.5 --> 3286.94
Wow thousand 56 right

3284.4 --> 3286.94
mmm

3287.39 --> 3297.2599999999998
but say okay it is what it is yeah you

3295.82 --> 3299.69
know what let's get into that for a

3297.26 --> 3302.2700000000004
second I do have a flat earth model I do

3299.69 --> 3305.27
I know everybody doesn't like it when I

3302.27 --> 3307.81
say it but I do do I do have a flat

3305.27 --> 3312.65
earth model I have a flat earth model

3307.81 --> 3317.33
it's a model it's complete it

3312.65 --> 3322.34
incorporates gas pressure everything all

3317.33 --> 3326.47
of that it's just as a presupposition of

3322.34 --> 3329.8700000000003
L which can could technically be proven

3326.47 --> 3332.93
probably much easier than the concept of

3329.87 --> 3337.8199999999997
the earth being a globe ever good or

3332.93 --> 3340.2799999999997
spherical of any sort so yeah I think my

3337.82 --> 3343.48
model is much more viable in the end

3340.28 --> 3350.2900000000004
it's just a little bit freaking surreal

3343.48 --> 3354.71
makes it look very holodeck ish or

3350.29 --> 3356.93
similar Tori as I said my I think that

3354.71 --> 3359.21
the world is similar Tori in nature

3356.93 --> 3361.43
doesn't mean it's not real doesn't mean

3359.21 --> 3363.71
like oh computers turned off and oh you

3361.43 --> 3368.48
wake up in the real world no it's just

3363.71 --> 3372.04
the way it is designed that's what I

3368.48 --> 3372.04
think so I have a model

3374.48 --> 3379.44
anyway thanks again Rasta for the

3376.95 --> 3382.74
superjet donation much appreciated

3432.82 --> 3442.6000000000004
oakley nathan since you're here you're

3437.08 --> 3444.67
welcome to put a a youtube link for your

3442.6 --> 3446.56
starting up flatters debate in my chat

3444.67 --> 3449.59
you can do it every time just put the

3446.56 --> 3451.72
link of that video in here so people can

3449.59 --> 3453.9700000000003
yeah i do it normally but yeah you're

3451.72 --> 3455.6499999999996
right on top of it and you have a wrench

3453.97 --> 3459.0099999999998
so it should be very easy for you to do

3455.65 --> 3461.17
just put that link in the chat so people

3459.01 --> 3463.71
can go to the Flat Earth debate right

3461.17 --> 3463.71
after this

3468.9 --> 3473.13
huh

3470.52 --> 3480.29
hi Greg well says Martin Kenny's model

3473.13 --> 3483.84
is spot on right that's no I don't know

3480.29 --> 3486.45
is it because I think it's pretty much

3483.84 --> 3489.4500000000003
kind of science fictiony in a way but

3486.45 --> 3492.27
who knows there it is interesting that I

3489.45 --> 3495.72
cannot deny it is absolutely interesting

3492.27 --> 3498.42
the egg Earth model it is fascinating

3495.72 --> 3501.24
and a a aha

3498.42 --> 3504.4500000000003
our whinnying for sight okay look look

3501.24 --> 3507.06
at my very very very first hangout ever

3504.45 --> 3509.04
the number one flattered talks before I

3507.06 --> 3512.5499999999997
wasn't even calling it flattered talks I

3509.04 --> 3515.84
had it in there I basically had it in

3512.55 --> 3520.71
there saying it is like a lotus of

3515.84 --> 3523.56
different layers folded in one another

3520.71 --> 3526.17
and I explained again special non

3523.56 --> 3530.22
looping or I mean special non-linearity

3526.17 --> 3532.61
aspect to it so maybe that's it you know

3530.22 --> 3536.58
maybe that's it maybe it is actually a

3532.61 --> 3539.73
flat ball like a flat surface perfectly

3536.58 --> 3540.96
flat and looping and the way every the

3539.73 --> 3541.65
surface that is present is

3540.96 --> 3543.48
interconnected

3541.65 --> 3548.01
is really like a ball it's very

3543.48 --> 3550.8
confusing all these options they remain

3548.01 --> 3553.4900000000002
they remain a technical possibility in

3550.8 --> 3553.4900000000002
my opinion

3553.91 --> 3565.0699999999997
it's all about figuring out is it that

3560.92 --> 3566.29
do we ever get the chance to confirm or

3565.07 --> 3570.73
disconfirm

3566.29 --> 3576.31
any of it that's it that's it

3570.73 --> 3576.31
so anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3581.78 --> 3590.69

Earth technicalities I don't have

somebody to reflect on I find it more
