58.71 --> 62.230000000000004
385 I'm your host

60.579 --> 64.03
Arwen and before we start the show

paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

78.55 --> 87.52
chats we much appreciate it

81.6 --> 89.82
so today the weather is it's okay it's a

87.52 --> 95.19
little less cloudy than yesterday I

89.82 --> 95.19
haven't seen any rain and it's gonna dry

95.729 --> 101.67
little Sun here and there not too much

104.52 --> 110.94999999999999
so today I have with me

108.729 --> 115.06
green tea once again I thought I'd try

110.95 --> 118.33
it out again I was getting a bit bored

115.06 --> 122.44
with the mint tea so let's see how that

118.33 --> 129.94
is and I got Illuminati Castle I already

122.44 --> 134.23
took a bite so let's see who is in

129.94 --> 138.82
Chapter II for being late guys yeah yeah

134.23 --> 143.17
I was I was a little late I went to bed

138.82 --> 146.68
pretty early and still a long sleep and

143.17 --> 151.66
groceries and yeah I had to kind of

146.68 --> 156.989
resolve the issue for myself dear friend

151.66 --> 163.959
because made of a pressure situation and

156.989 --> 164.73000000000002
she kind of like wanted me to help her

163.959 --> 168.28
out

164.73 --> 170.10999999999999
just because she's while she's putting

168.28 --> 174.07
herself under a lot of stress and she's

170.11 --> 177.269
a single mom practically with yeah

174.07 --> 179.829
father that's kind of an insane guy and

177.269 --> 186.549
very unpleasant and it's a tense

179.829 --> 189.519
situation for her and and yeah this is

186.549 --> 193.15
like the first real celebratory birthday

189.519 --> 196.84
of her daughter and it's like it's

193.15 --> 202.32
pretty tough because I can't go there I

196.84 --> 203.86
don't have the money I and I don't wanna

202.32 --> 208.57
go there

203.86 --> 210.01000000000002
weak handed I just also because there's

208.57 --> 213.97
probably going to be other friends there

210.01 --> 215.79899999999998
and then if I'm like uncomfortable

213.97 --> 219.609
that's just gonna be not a good

215.799 --> 221.769
situation be able to help her out as

219.609 --> 225.01000000000002
well because that's what I really try to

221.769 --> 228.34
do it try to be the friends stress

225.01 --> 230.14
support over the phone like I am

228.34 --> 232.57
available to her no matter what

230.14 --> 234.17
pretty much although if she called me

232.57 --> 236.959
right now

234.17 --> 238.60999999999999
then I probably say please wait until

236.959 --> 241.66
after the show but other than that it's

238.61 --> 244.56900000000002
like I just decided for myself that I

241.66 --> 246.709
need to be available for her because

244.569 --> 251.42
apparently I'm one of the few people

246.709 --> 255.65
that actually handles that and she has a

251.42 --> 257.239
lot of stress but I couldn't go there so

255.65 --> 260.9
I had a text message is like a really

257.239 --> 261.859
proper text message and I couldn't tell

260.9 --> 266.32
her to her face

261.859 --> 269.45
like it was too emotional and all so

266.32 --> 271.88
feel bit conflicted about that but I

269.45 --> 275.28999999999996
feel that there's really nothing I could

271.88 --> 281.3
have done without creating another

275.29 --> 289.28000000000003
stressful situation anyway I am doing

281.3 --> 291.22
the show so here I am yeah eleven

289.28 --> 296.92999999999995
o'clock Major Tom

291.22 --> 304.90000000000003
right so chat Keith Richards was first

296.93 --> 304.90000000000003
hmm let me scan Tom Parker Robin Stanley

306.94 --> 314.59
intentional spaced out intentionally

309.65 --> 314.59
spaced out over mocha

316.87 --> 324.56
- no fish gÃ©nifique Edyta if I press it

323.27 --> 336.83
I don't have pronounce that correctly

324.56 --> 347.72
but laude Latia ho Ian Adams I made you

336.83 --> 354.11
Tom matrix media Michael Rock Bates 60

347.72 --> 359.75
air RMC account I might be repeating

354.11 --> 364.46000000000004
some of you now Truckee alive Karen be

359.75 --> 369.47
good to see you yeah I I'm gonna blocked

364.46 --> 371.81
a couple of people and now that I really

369.47 --> 374.47900000000004
went too far yesterday I just forgot to

371.81 --> 376.34
unblock them right away after it's just

374.479 --> 381.11
that some people went a little too far

376.34 --> 386.06
but their overall decent conversation is

381.11 --> 388.46000000000004
so like made you Tom yeah but they all

386.06 --> 392.24
had to double down in the last minute

388.46 --> 394.099
yesterday with Brenda yeah I had I had

392.24 --> 396.83
some questions about that to my audience

394.099 --> 401.419
also like how do you think I handled

396.83 --> 405.159
that in retrospect I actually got some I

401.419 --> 408.289
guess complaints from people that I was

405.159 --> 410.03
necessarily raising my voice and I was

408.289 --> 414.44
wondering what you guys were thinking of

410.03 --> 418.48999999999995
that I I could have chosen to kind of

414.44 --> 419.96
not do that and stay calm but I I kind

418.49 --> 421.88
of wanted to get Brent out of the way

419.96 --> 426.71
because she was just gonna do her own

421.88 --> 428.9
thing and and she in a way practically

426.71 --> 434.44
started out raising her voice with her

428.9 --> 434.44
crazy declaration of victory and

435.85 --> 442.28000000000003
yeah if I had kept my voice down I think

439.46 --> 444.26
that I probably at some point would just

442.28 --> 446.53999999999996
have to drop her because she would just

444.26 --> 450.26
go rambling on and on and on and I

446.54 --> 455.06
thought I move in on a maybe a bit of a

450.26 --> 458.46999999999997
Nathan Oakley move and not too far but I

455.06 --> 458.47
don't know what you guys think of that

463.09 --> 467.77
all right Robin Stanley well she's

466.25 --> 470.66
always like that

467.77 --> 475.01
Brenda sucks as McCarron B says it oh

470.66 --> 478.54
yes you know it's it's kind of weird

475.01 --> 482.87
though because for example a year ago

478.54 --> 485.71000000000004
she could be kind of alright but now

482.87 --> 488.6
she's just almost like this weird

485.71 --> 492.46999999999997
communist militant attitude for the

488.6 --> 494.36
globe very odd it's classical her

492.47 --> 498.20000000000005
starting out with the Declaration of

494.36 --> 509.6
victory that is such a communist thing

498.2 --> 513.08
to do anyway turn up the volume and my

509.6 --> 518.41
love oh yeah yeah I see it

513.08 --> 523.85
ah I don't know why it reset it itself

518.41 --> 527.28
how's this is this better yeah yeah it

523.85 --> 532.0400000000001
presented itself greats

527.28 --> 532.04
the gates should be a tendon was at zero

532.46 --> 536.27
thank you for pointing that out

548.35 --> 552.96
all right anyway I'd like to get some

550.42 --> 552.9599999999999
feedback

556.92 --> 568.069
besides Brenda sucks because I you know

563.179 --> 570.929
people are kind of falling in their own

568.069 --> 575.429
little process in their own like Nathan

570.929 --> 578.429
does this and grantee also does it but

575.429 --> 587.0889999999999
he seems to be more flexible that's it's

578.429 --> 587.0889999999999
interesting Randy is really I don't know

589.23 --> 593.7
but for example Nathan is kind of set in

591.899 --> 596.88
his way he has a very specific method

593.7 --> 598.86
and he does his shtick it's his thing

596.88 --> 606.6899999999999
and everybody expects him to he is

598.86 --> 610.92
getting very good at it but I I want to

606.69 --> 613.5600000000001
kind of like progress the interactions

610.92 --> 619.8199999999999
with ballers or maybe with lesser

613.56 --> 619.8199999999999
ballers with way.i with less fanatical

619.91 --> 626.67
because I don't I I don't feel really

624.0 --> 631.8
satisfied with kind of really trying to

626.67 --> 635.04
copy other people's stick I really want

631.8 --> 640.3199999999999
to progress the interaction further

635.04 --> 642.329
especially to clear things more up well

640.32 --> 644.339
I'm already doing my best to basically

642.329 --> 647.31
expose the machinations I guess that is

644.339 --> 649.98
really a thing of this time because the

647.31 --> 653.5189999999999
enemy the ballers the real fanatical

649.98 --> 656.779
ones they constantly insert machinations

653.519 --> 659.76
and deviation strategies even within oh

656.779 --> 662.899
oh thanks Randy for pointing that out

659.76 --> 662.899
it's frozen again

666.46 --> 670.62
yeah thanks

678.55 --> 686.4499999999999
hermÃ¨s yeah I kind of get that after

683.03 --> 689.86
that declaration I was already like oh

686.45 --> 692.84
my god really

689.86 --> 695.03
it was extremely annoying but I thought

692.84 --> 697.48
okay let's just see how crazy she's

695.03 --> 697.48
gonna get

704.84 --> 710.3000000000001
you know I thought I thought my in my

707.06 --> 713.26
start her team was pretty good her

710.3 --> 715.91
declaring victories so me basically

713.26 --> 718.28
trying to refine that statement even

715.91 --> 720.3199999999999
though it is ridiculous of course but

718.28 --> 722.48
just to clarify like what is it a

720.32 --> 725.72
victory about what specifically can you

722.48 --> 727.46
be more specific just one example if you

725.72 --> 729.14
say it's all that's really nice but can

727.46 --> 735.71
you give one example and how that is a

729.14 --> 738.35
win and that's what I try to do but then

735.71 --> 741.6700000000001
it's spiraled off in in yeah in the

738.35 --> 744.59
machinations and gravity and all that

741.67 --> 748.4
yeah Brenda is there to waste our time

744.59 --> 750.2
that is true but even though that is

748.4 --> 753.56
what she's trying to do that doesn't

750.2 --> 757.1
mean that we can not then get something

753.56 --> 759.67
out of it even if just as a studying

757.1 --> 759.6700000000001
object

768.53 --> 780.53
yes Larry the March I am but in some

778.16 --> 783.37
ways there will be certain

780.53 --> 786.65
presuppositions mainly the equatorial

783.37 --> 789.35
orientation because there is just no

786.65 --> 791.42
definitive certainty about this and it's

789.35 --> 793.88
already like in the middle of our realm

791.42 --> 797.38
pretty literally like literally the

793.88 --> 800.51
middle the presupposed middle line but

797.38 --> 803.03
how is it a middle line is it a straight

800.51 --> 805.37
line and then the ball as you say is

803.03 --> 807.3199999999999
over the curve a straight line but that

805.37 --> 808.94
there's no curvature so it would be a

807.32 --> 811.37
straight line and that would definitely

808.94 --> 816.08
point at some kind of looping element or

811.37 --> 818.8100000000001
is it an arc and which is weird or is it

816.08 --> 823.61
a complete literal geometrical circle

818.81 --> 826.67
and yeah you're gonna have to presuppose

823.61 --> 829.1
one of these things in some way because

826.67 --> 831.77
we don't know so even the basic

829.1 --> 835.0400000000001
orientation of our realm is not known to

831.77 --> 840.62
us really not physically fundamentally

835.04 --> 844.24
provably so so you cannot bypass a

840.62 --> 846.98
presupposition in any kind of

844.24 --> 852.71
conceptualization of the realm at this

846.98 --> 854.6
point but yeah if you just clear up what

852.71 --> 856.82
these presuppositions are and what the

854.6 --> 859.0400000000001
alternative possibilities to those

856.82 --> 860.44
presuppositions are then that's just

859.04 --> 865.37
great

860.44 --> 869.24
but I don't really go beyond singular

865.37 --> 870.68
pointed out presuppositions I'm not

869.24 --> 872.36
gonna presuppose everything I'm not

870.68 --> 875.9
gonna presuppose the earth is a ball I'm

872.36 --> 880.13
not gonna presuppose that the horizon

875.9 --> 881.6899999999999
that visual effect is the leading edge

880.13 --> 884.45
of the sphere which it is at the

881.69 --> 886.97
provably so and I'm not going to

884.45 --> 889.5200000000001
presuppose that all these lights in the

886.97 --> 892.34
sky are physical objects that insane

889.52 --> 894.35
distances away and that we're speeded

892.34 --> 896.62
spinning in the middle of that all as

894.35 --> 899.57
the presuppose globe I'm not gonna go

896.62 --> 901.6
presuppositional that giant house of

899.57 --> 904.6600000000001
cards of presuppositions

901.6 --> 908.01
I'll just take one or two maybe and I'll

904.66 --> 908.01
be very strict about it

917.82 --> 927.0100000000001
but as for knowing what this realm is

922.74 --> 932.74
yeah the knowledge is not there not for

927.01 --> 935.97
us not for me and even old pictures even

932.74 --> 940.36
archaically old super super old things

935.97 --> 944.26
even that is not proof it is still based

940.36 --> 947.14
on what the designers of that concept

944.26 --> 949.93
utilized the world as and you don't

947.14 --> 952.8389999999999
necessarily know how far they explored

949.93 --> 960.0889999999999
that how precise they were in their in

952.839 --> 962.3800000000001
their explorations and measurements yeah

960.089 --> 965.32
because if you go with that know I've

962.38 --> 968.86
done of course it must be a bubble over

965.32 --> 975.9100000000001
a disk because all those old pictures

968.86 --> 981.01
show that although yeah if you're gonna

975.91 --> 985.4699999999999
go rigidly through empirical data then

981.01 --> 985.47
it's not sufficient it's just a big hint

987.15 --> 990.4
[Music]

996.41 --> 1005.98
no no John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt

1001.92 --> 1011.1999999999999
the linchpin of the entire EFI movement

1005.98 --> 1014.5600000000001
the container is not presuppose it's a

1011.2 --> 1020.1400000000001
natural law it has to be there because

1014.56 --> 1025.839
we got gas pressure it's not presupposed

1020.14 --> 1029.5
I've been hearing that really bad bad

1025.839 --> 1032.74
V's argument and it's ridiculous you're

1029.5 --> 1039.18
literally just ignoring the true

1032.74 --> 1039.18
scientific law foundations the real ones

1039.209 --> 1045.04
the ones you so conveniently keep

1042.37 --> 1056.4699999999998
ignoring in order to propel forth your

1045.04 --> 1058.36
science like priesthood oh really Larry

1056.47 --> 1062.8600000000001
two marks well why don't you show me gas

1058.36 --> 1066.3999999999999
pressure without a container then now

1062.86 --> 1069.6
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt oh my

1066.4 --> 1069.6000000000001
god who is this guy

1073.36 --> 1075.99
this

1076.24 --> 1085.33
yeah and I don't nobody has that kind of

1079.33 --> 1091.05
name so this is just somebody going

1085.33 --> 1091.05
undercover wonder who it is

1095.16 --> 1097.8200000000002
yeah

1101.139 --> 1107.6789999999999
okay well congratulations if that's your

1104.179 --> 1114.3200000000002
real name but it's ridiculous

1107.679 --> 1117.229
in order for gas pressure to settle it

1114.32 --> 1120.9189999999999
has to be contained within a container

1117.229 --> 1123.8890000000001
and gravity there is no scientific proof

1120.919 --> 1127.279
for gravity Newton never claimed the

1123.889 --> 1128.57
hypothesis for gravitation and Einstein

1127.279 --> 1131.72
E Einstein

1128.57 --> 1136.07
who's supposed to be the leading front

1131.72 --> 1137.929
of gravity as a foundation now it's been

1136.07 --> 1141.049
designated as two you have to figure out

1137.929 --> 1144.3490000000002
his thing well he even did said that

1141.049 --> 1146.09
gravity isn't even a force and then

1144.349 --> 1147.739
everybody says but you can think of it

1146.09 --> 1149.599
as a force well I don't think I

1147.739 --> 1151.1290000000001
understand really cared he just made it

1149.599 --> 1152.359
to something else he said it's the

1151.129 --> 1156.849
bending of space-time

1152.359 --> 1160.97
but that space-time is literally a

1156.849 --> 1163.609
mathematical based geometrical pseudo

1160.97 --> 1168.289
realm it is a conceptual medium that

1163.609 --> 1170.269
doesn't exist and well a lot of people

1168.289 --> 1173.869
in physics or well not a fit in

1170.269 --> 1176.389
astrophysics they just ignored Einstein

1173.869 --> 1180.7099999999998
and then they're gonna assume again that

1176.389 --> 1182.9599999999998
gravity is this force as Newton

1180.71 --> 1186.019
described even though he never claimed

1182.96 --> 1187.029
the hypothesis not adding to that like

1186.019 --> 1191.69
oh yeah

1187.029 --> 1193.489
somebody might work out how it is so no

1191.69 --> 1196.059
he never snow just said no I definitely

1193.489 --> 1201.919
do not claim a hypothesis for this

1196.059 --> 1207.109
because he knew it was just yeah a

1201.919 --> 1210.0490000000002
mechanism it was a system to not need to

1207.109 --> 1212.899
delve into relative density for his

1210.049 --> 1215.33
formulas it's just a trick a mechanical

1212.899 --> 1217.9699999999998
trick say okay there's a force

1215.33 --> 1220.009
disequilibrium present at all time yeah

1217.97 --> 1223.249
you could conceptualize it like that and

1220.009 --> 1225.44
it works out with all his Newtonian

1223.249 --> 1229.309
mechanics but he never claimed the

1225.44 --> 1232.009
hypothesis it was just a law for his

1229.309 --> 1233.81
mechanics specifically do you get that

1232.009 --> 1236.93
you never claimed the hypothesis

1233.81 --> 1239.9299999999998
and still people assume that it is that

1236.93 --> 1242.96
but there's no hypothesis there there is

1239.93 --> 1245.71
no proof for gravity there is no

1242.96 --> 1253.21
scientific experiment proving gravity

1245.71 --> 1255.71
never was no yep oh no the densities not

1253.21 --> 1257.27
yeah yeah there is there is it's

1255.71 --> 1259.3700000000001
scientifically proven we've demonstrated

1257.27 --> 1263.96
it and then can do that again and again

1259.37 --> 1268.01
and again you can really really not like

1263.96 --> 1270.53
it but that doesn't make it not viable

1268.01 --> 1272.78
it is viable and it is repeatable and a

1270.53 --> 1275.1499999999999
lot of people have repeated it any kid

1272.78 --> 1280.1
could repeat it as long as they are

1275.15 --> 1283.3100000000002
cleared up with how it really works the

1280.1 --> 1287.98
mechanics of it and that is the relative

1283.31 --> 1292.6699999999998
density theory is based on an object

1287.98 --> 1296.21
presumably or a body of matter its

1292.67 --> 1297.74
density versus the density of the medium

1296.21 --> 1299.3600000000001
that surrounds it now if it's going to

1297.74 --> 1301.97
be a gas it's just going to move in all

1299.36 --> 1304.49
directions and unless it's contained in

1301.97 --> 1306.56
for example balloon and then it matters

1304.49 --> 1309.29
if the combined density of that balloon

1306.56 --> 1312.34
skin probably rubber or something and

1309.29 --> 1314.8999999999999
the gas within if its density in

1312.34 --> 1317.33
relation to the density of the medium

1314.9 --> 1320.48
that surrounds it which will be the

1317.33 --> 1323.27
typical atmospheric or the Atmos blowing

1320.48 --> 1328.31
the gas within that we breathe oxygen

1323.27 --> 1331.61
nitrogen all that stuff well its density

1328.31 --> 1333.11
will be higher in relation to that

1331.61 --> 1334.9099999999999
helium balloon and then that helium

1333.11 --> 1336.6799999999998
balloon is going to be at this

1334.91 --> 1341.5700000000002
equilibrium with its surroundings at a

1336.68 --> 1343.7
certain rate right and then because it

1341.57 --> 1347.09
is lighter than its running it will move

1343.7 --> 1349.25
upwards that is said if you know in the

1347.09 --> 1352.52
relative density theory it's just set

1349.25 --> 1355.13
you could call it the law the natural

1352.52 --> 1356.66
law of this mechanic because that is

1355.13 --> 1359.8100000000002
just how it is there is no given

1356.66 --> 1361.5500000000002
hypothesis for the alignment just like

1359.81 --> 1365.059
Newton didn't claim hypotheses for

1361.55 --> 1367.039
gravity there's no explanation directly

1365.059 --> 1370.22
that we could scientifically prove as to

1367.039 --> 1373.639
the directions but if relative density

1370.22 --> 1375.409
theory an object is lower in density

1373.639 --> 1377.809
than its surroundings it will move up in

1375.409 --> 1381.3200000000002
an accelerator in an excel Ettore

1377.809 --> 1384.86
fashion accelerate re yeah that's it in

1381.32 --> 1386.9289999999999
an accelerated fashion proving that it

1384.86 --> 1389.269
is suddenly being subjected by a force

1386.929 --> 1393.249
yeah measurably so it's force it starts

1389.269 --> 1397.279
to accelerate if it can and if it can't

1393.249 --> 1398.69
well then it will change if the

1397.279 --> 1400.82
maneuverability is not there if it's

1398.69 --> 1403.249
stuck or if it's against something

1400.82 --> 1405.23
whether something heavy pushes down to

1403.249 --> 1407.99
it on it or something like pushes up on

1405.23 --> 1410.1490000000001
it then that relative density

1407.99 --> 1413.09
disequilibrium will translate itself

1410.149 --> 1416.6589999999999
into pressure locally because it still

1413.09 --> 1418.639
wants to go that direction because with

1416.659 --> 1420.98
its surroundings the gas that still

1418.639 --> 1424.7299999999998
surrounds it despite the the object

1420.98 --> 1426.769
getting in the way preventing its

1424.73 --> 1428.809
maneuverability it's still not at

1426.769 --> 1430.629
equilibrium is still wants to move so it

1428.809 --> 1432.86
will translate itself into pressure

1430.629 --> 1436.639
that's how it works and it's how it all

1432.86 --> 1439.9089999999999
works with the gas filled balloons with

1436.639 --> 1443.4399999999998
giant heavy objects in liquids in water

1439.909 --> 1448.999
and in super-heavy liquids it always

1443.44 --> 1452.95
works every single time and you can even

1448.999 --> 1455.419
mathematically make a formula for it

1452.95 --> 1457.73
will be based on a relative density

1455.419 --> 1461.0590000000002
differential because that is really what

1457.73 --> 1462.71
the density the relative density theory

1461.059 --> 1467.019
is about the differential between an

1462.71 --> 1470.929
object and its medium and yeah you can

1467.019 --> 1474.6490000000001
mechanically then mathematically even

1470.929 --> 1477.1390000000001
predict like how much speed will it be

1474.649 --> 1481.1589999999999
gaining with its displacement how much

1477.139 --> 1482.389
pressure will be exerted all of that can

1481.159 --> 1484.6390000000001
be fine-tuned

1482.389 --> 1490.369
I'm not good at that [Â __Â ] but I know

1484.639 --> 1492.2589999999998
that there are people great at it so

1490.369 --> 1494.869
yeah you could even have your lovely

1492.259 --> 1496.49
lovely math explanation that's all

1494.869 --> 1499.03
you're so many of you are just almost

1496.49 --> 1502.13
like

1499.03 --> 1505.1
getting all wet over that [Â __Â ] I don't

1502.13 --> 1506.8400000000001
really care I just know how it works and

1505.1 --> 1508.85
it can explain it with words and

1506.84 --> 1510.9189999999999
practical examples and I think that is

1508.85 --> 1513.26
much more valuable because anyone can

1510.919 --> 1516.1100000000001
then without having necessarily

1513.26 --> 1519.44
knowledge of math or talent that it can

1516.11 --> 1521.809
just try that for themselves and then

1519.44 --> 1524.21
you got real science you got the real

1521.809 --> 1526.61
science that scientism and their ball

1524.21 --> 1528.799
[Â __Â ] always love to pretend that they

1526.61 --> 1531.1689999999999
are the science can be done by kids it

1528.799 --> 1533.03
can be done by kids yeah and then they

1531.169 --> 1535.5800000000002
teach the kids to presuppose nonsense

1533.03 --> 1538.7
well this science can actually be done

1535.58 --> 1542.3899999999999
by kids and it will be actual scientific

1538.7 --> 1546.26
experiment based this science can be

1542.39 --> 1550.6100000000001
done by children but it is still

1546.26 --> 1552.32
mentally a tough process so children may

1550.61 --> 1559.0
have a trouble with it but they can

1552.32 --> 1559.0
practically do it and it will be valid

1564.1 --> 1577.4499999999998
ah goodbye

1569.429 --> 1580.0900000000001
wanker yeah the thing is I don't need

1577.45 --> 1582.01
you around to keep on whining and

1580.09 --> 1585.34
whining and ignoring everything I said

1582.01 --> 1588.669
I'm just using you as an incentive to

1585.34 --> 1592.9599999999998
really put it down there and when I do

1588.669 --> 1595.9
that I absolutely don't expect the

1592.96 --> 1598.409
person actually forwarding that making

1595.9 --> 1601.45
me do that that he'll listen to that

1598.409 --> 1603.88
absolutely not because if they would be

1601.45 --> 1605.5
listening to these type of things they

1603.88 --> 1607.0300000000002
wouldn't be saying these type of things

1605.5 --> 1610.24
in chat but that doesn't mean that

1607.03 --> 1613.03
there's an other people also reading

1610.24 --> 1615.85
that for a while and listening and they

1613.03 --> 1620.6399999999999
hey if they want they can use my

1615.85 --> 1622.24
explanation as audio clips if they want

1620.64 --> 1624.789
I'm up for that

1622.24 --> 1625.78
and then I'm talking about these types

1624.789 --> 1629.08
of audio clips

1625.78 --> 1630.97
I would prefer though if somebody wanted

1629.08 --> 1633.22
to do that that they kind of yet at

1630.97 --> 1636.88
least told me and said where they were

1633.22 --> 1639.929
gonna use it but that's kind of what I'm

1636.88 --> 1639.929
hoping to do with it

1640.97 --> 1644.119
[Music]

1645.87 --> 1652.4599999999998
a GM why why why are you saying that

1670.26 --> 1676.94
oh okay yeah I don't think your jokes

1674.52 --> 1676.94
are funny

1690.19 --> 1693.219
[Music]

1708.64 --> 1711.8090000000002
[Music]

1715.29 --> 1723.56
yeah I don't think it's funny to to tell

1719.73 --> 1726.48
me when I'm really really careful to

1723.56 --> 1730.53
keep my show consistent and to not go

1726.48 --> 1733.77
over the top okay so it's not funny so

1730.53 --> 1736.8899999999999
then just say oh he's gonna go over the

1733.77 --> 1740.85
top no I you know how much effort I put

1736.89 --> 1743.1000000000001
in to really not letting me go it's like

1740.85 --> 1745.1999999999998
one of the primary objectives of what I

1743.1 --> 1747.12
do here and hey sometimes it does go out

1745.2 --> 1750.48
of control it's not funny

1747.12 --> 1756.8
a gem people are getting freaking thrown

1750.48 --> 1756.8
of youtube for that [Â __Â ] it's not funny

1762.23 --> 1769.02
now on the other hand I was very

1765.39 --> 1772.6200000000001
surprised yesterday to see no more news

1769.02 --> 1780.21
going live I thought like wait what that

1772.62 --> 1788.58
guy still just going okay hmm I wonder

1780.21 --> 1792.03
really what YouTube is doing it is it's

1788.58 --> 1796.08
just it seems almost like it was more of

1792.03 --> 1800.82
an excuse to just throw throw people

1796.08 --> 1802.4399999999998
that they didn't like off it and after

1800.82 --> 1804.45
that they don't really care anymore it's

1802.44 --> 1808.38
just they put it in it's almost like a

1804.45 --> 1810.48
patriot act of YouTube they just want to

1808.38 --> 1813.63
be able to throw anyone off at it at a

1810.48 --> 1817.55
whim but it doesn't mean that they're

1813.63 --> 1817.5500000000002
all going to immediately purge everyone

1820.31 --> 1828.19
oh really

1828.34 --> 1846.35
AGM I'm sorry I didn't know that was a

1834.07 --> 1848.86
forbidden word is it I rarely use it

1846.35 --> 1848.86
anyway

1851.51 --> 1855.529
[Music]

1871.66 --> 1875.3400000000001
yeah Thank You Brandon cook

1876.87 --> 1882.9099999999999
yeah it is sometimes an enormous effort

1880.21 --> 1887.28
because I had to have just bizarre

1882.91 --> 1890.1100000000001
tendencies sometimes like I really I

1887.28 --> 1892.33
like when I see a lot of people yeah

1890.11 --> 1894.01
when I feel like really pissed off or

1892.33 --> 1897.46
something and I see a lot of people just

1894.01 --> 1901.0
throwing just nasty nasty level [Â __Â ] out

1897.46 --> 1905.8600000000001
just totally unashamed then sometimes I

1901.0 --> 1908.92
just want to kind of like terrify the

1905.86 --> 1910.0
[Â __Â ] out of them just show like how bad

1908.92 --> 1912.52
it can get

1910.0 --> 1914.94
but in a little bit more controlled

1912.52 --> 1918.31
fashion it's like the rage way in effect

1914.94 --> 1920.26
and it's not good when I do that it's a

1918.31 --> 1922.78
bad tendency but it is kind of like how

1920.26 --> 1925.87
I responded to how I learned to deal

1922.78 --> 1932.7
with that because I've had people almost

1925.87 --> 1932.6999999999998
to my face do that level of [Â __Â ] as well

1934.54 --> 1939.72
not a lot but it should

1951.78 --> 1963.03
let's get out of here Fyodor no way if

1960.15 --> 1966.0
you really think that then yeah you're

1963.03 --> 1967.72
not as smart as I thought you were come

1966.0 --> 1970.869
on

1967.72 --> 1970.869
[Music]

1982.1 --> 1992.33
all right thank you stallion 8012 all

1989.6 --> 1995.8999999999999
right oh you're gonna prod some yeah I

1992.33 --> 2000.34
haven't progressed any at that been too

1995.9 --> 2004.63
busy without his stuff but hey as you

2000.34 --> 2008.1689999999999
know I don't think it's mandatory to

2004.63 --> 2010.179
read the Bible Oh what did I say I think

2008.169 --> 2014.3200000000002
it's very wise to have at least read it

2010.179 --> 2016.299
once in your life absolutely and I

2014.32 --> 2020.47
definitely recommend everyone to do that

2016.299 --> 2021.82
when they're ready for it but no I'm not

2020.47 --> 2024.49
afraid did not read it

2021.82 --> 2026.559
because I kind of get the gist of it and

2024.49 --> 2028.929
I've had a lot of reference from other

2026.559 --> 2030.73
people as to what it's about and I

2028.929 --> 2036.01
already have an approach to it and

2030.73 --> 2040.57
everything I'm reading just basically

2036.01 --> 2042.25
confirms my assertions about it and some

2040.57 --> 2044.11
surprises of course specially in the Old

2042.25 --> 2046.6
Testament and when I talked about it

2044.11 --> 2048.0899999999997
like things left out and there's so much

2046.6 --> 2051.0099999999998
to it

2048.09 --> 2054.359
yeah Ian Adams well not the one with the

2051.01 --> 2054.3590000000004
wine bottles I'll tell you that

2078.22 --> 2087.669
pulling Fyodor Dostoevsky you know that

2082.21 --> 2092.4700000000003
polling concerning things that what do

2087.669 --> 2095.77
you expect look the whole media has put

2092.47 --> 2098.29
out so much manipulating information

2095.77 --> 2101.2
about this [Â __Â ] about the impeachment

2098.29 --> 2103.72
and all that pushing so hard on that

2101.2 --> 2107.6699999999996
that they are if it gonna be victorious

2103.72 --> 2110.6189999999997
that ya know are you surprised that

2107.67 --> 2113.319
polls will still have a lot of people

2110.619 --> 2115.9
say oh my god that's gonna happen is

2113.319 --> 2118.21
that any kind of indication that it will

2115.9 --> 2121.75
happen no it just means the media has

2118.21 --> 2123.73
been surprisingly effective in fear

2121.75 --> 2127.359
pointing everyone into believing that

2123.73 --> 2130.21
it's gonna happen but it's not there's

2127.359 --> 2134.17
nothing gonna happen it's so ridiculous

2130.21 --> 2138.63
all of it it's it's literally as charade

2134.17 --> 2143.79
as they come it's total waste of time

2138.63 --> 2143.79
and at trump I'm pretty sure that

2144.78 --> 2151.4500000000003
whatever he's doing whatever his

2147.67 --> 2155.7400000000002
objectives are I don't think he's not in

2151.45 --> 2159.73
control at this point he's just not

2155.74 --> 2161.9199999999996
doing it how a lot of people wish he

2159.73 --> 2165.97
would have done it that's the real

2161.92 --> 2170.89
problem I think but he's not gonna be a

2165.97 --> 2177.52
peach is ridiculous well not legally

2170.89 --> 2181.75
anyway you never know like try to do

2177.52 --> 2183.79
some quick crazy thing or just go

2181.75 --> 2186.04
illegally who knows what what they'll do

2183.79 --> 2188.349
I don't think there's anything gonna

2186.04 --> 2194.069
happen I think it's literally a charade

2188.349 --> 2194.069
that'll go off with a dud at the end

2209.6 --> 2225.2599999999998
Zep tepi who I I don't know in a way I

2222.65 --> 2228.53
don't think he is coming back although I

2225.26 --> 2231.55
think his spirit has come back and maybe

2228.53 --> 2231.55
stronger than ever

2233.41 --> 2241.99
the it's just I've never really believed

2239.42 --> 2241.9900000000002
in the rapture

2256.32 --> 2263.13
but yeah I don't know look what do you

2260.43 --> 2265.14
exactly mean with coming back do you

2263.13 --> 2268.1
mean that like a portal in heaven is

2265.14 --> 2274.35
gonna open up and he's gonna come here

2268.1 --> 2277.56
or is it gonna be like a a switch like a

2274.35 --> 2279.33
switch where everybody's subtly

2277.56 --> 2281.79
subjected to the other dimension and

2279.33 --> 2283.17
they're he's coming and will do things I

2281.79 --> 2285.06
don't know

2283.17 --> 2290.88
I don't know how literal you should take

2285.06 --> 2294.83
him coming back it's yes secret a

2290.88 --> 2294.83
Sherman I have a dear life indeed I

2296.81 --> 2304.56
haven't done anything on it yet except

2299.16 --> 2306.77
follow other people I'll put the link

2304.56 --> 2306.77
out

2323.109 --> 2335.2889999999998
okay well is that Pepe look I'm not the

2330.43 --> 2337.45
most keen of scriptura lists so I'm not

2335.289 --> 2341.4590000000003
yeah I haven't even read the whole thing

2337.45 --> 2344.68
yet so but as for my own preliminary

2341.459 --> 2346.269
interpretations and going for multiple

2344.68 --> 2347.8289999999997
angle interpretations like in the

2346.269 --> 2352.359
spiritual realm in the physical world

2347.829 --> 2356.4100000000003
all that you could say that with all

2352.359 --> 2360.549
this unjustice justice comes back and

2356.41 --> 2363.549
the the realizations that come with it

2360.549 --> 2365.619
it's like it force awakens the spirit of

2363.549 --> 2375.519
Jesus in people and then it's up to them

2365.619 --> 2377.8900000000003
more than ever to choose so a secret

2375.519 --> 2381.6699999999996
Asian then ah yeah that's my favorite

2377.89 --> 2392.68
one that Alex Jones had it's so freakin

2381.67 --> 2402.42
hilarious yeah yeah he's posting memes

2392.68 --> 2402.4199999999996
indie life a Issa good to see you

2415.43 --> 2420.739
No

2417.6 --> 2420.739
[Music]

2431.18 --> 2441.0699999999997
right well September 10th rotational ice

2436.13 --> 2445.25
very close to the spirit realm

2441.07 --> 2449.8700000000003
interpretation I yeah while back it was

2445.25 --> 2452.06
in in my darker period where also when I

2449.87 --> 2454.16
called yeah I called it gazing into the

2452.06 --> 2456.73
deep and having the the balance between

2454.16 --> 2461.89
light and dark energies and how they

2456.73 --> 2461.89
what they do it kind of ties into that

2462.43 --> 2473.24
it's a more mechanical way to approach a

2467.5 --> 2475.46
spiritual responses and there's an like

2473.24 --> 2478.0099999999998
spiritual awakening and even growing

2475.46 --> 2481.67
darker it has specific patterns it's

2478.01 --> 2484.7000000000003
like a spiritual crystal and it reflects

2481.67 --> 2488.06
or it crystallizes it it manifests

2484.7 --> 2493.0099999999998
itself also physically it does reflect

2488.06 --> 2496.21
upon the body visibly so for those who

2493.01 --> 2499.07
have fine-tuned senses but also

2496.21 --> 2503.2400000000002
eventually for those that don't then

2499.07 --> 2506.6000000000004
they'll see yeah because for example big

2503.24 --> 2513.74
big darkness and big conflict inside

2506.6 --> 2516.67
will eventually start to mutate even the

2513.74 --> 2516.6699999999996
person physically

2519.559 --> 2527.65
because yeah the spirit reflects upon

2522.289 --> 2529.4590000000003
the body I see that as a natural law is

2527.65 --> 2533.7490000000003
psychosomatic

2529.459 --> 2536.93
the cause is psychosomatic s-- in a way

2533.749 --> 2542.1989999999996
although the psychosomatic is a more

2536.93 --> 2546.979
direct process it is thus a the root of

2542.199 --> 2563.4790000000003
that effect of physical corruption yeah

2546.979 --> 2566.109
that's what I think even Adams the

2563.479 --> 2566.109
disciples

2569.92 --> 2577.04
that disciples wrote the pieces and then

2573.5 --> 2582.89
I think they convened among one another

2577.04 --> 2591.38
as to what to make the the purest of

2582.89 --> 2593.87
truth at it and then later how the

2591.38 --> 2603.08
church happened and then suddenly other

2593.87 --> 2605.18
things start to get involved I really do

2603.08 --> 2607.61
wonder sometimes and please don't take

2605.18 --> 2609.23
this as some kind of blasphemy but I

2607.61 --> 2613.94
really wonder sometimes what's the

2609.23 --> 2617.0
original Bible just the original texts

2613.94 --> 2620.15
and not what the church made into the

2617.0 --> 2623.12
Bible books was the original text even

2620.15 --> 2625.9100000000003
that cohesive or was it much more

2623.12 --> 2628.67
spiritual was it really more spiritual

2625.91 --> 2631.0699999999997
about the path and about the example

2628.67 --> 2633.29
about the effect was it lent from the

2631.07 --> 2637.55
from the dark world from the other side

2633.29 --> 2640.21
from their unique experiences as they

2637.55 --> 2647.1800000000003
were approached by the creator spirit

2640.21 --> 2648.59
through Jesus I think that is kind of

2647.18 --> 2654.5299999999997
what that was like and I think that

2648.59 --> 2657.6800000000003
later the church made it more yeah they

2654.53 --> 2661.7200000000003
put in they they did their their tricks

2657.68 --> 2665.66
to make it like super perfect to make it

2661.72 --> 2668.9599999999996
more magical and they put in all the

2665.66 --> 2671.54
other weird the celestial reflecting

2668.96 --> 2673.94
things the stories of this they

2671.54 --> 2676.87
rearranged probably some things into

2673.94 --> 2676.87
making it

2681.3 --> 2688.9300000000003
I'm forgetting the word for it

2683.94 --> 2691.42
the Gnostic I think it's Gnostics the

2688.93 --> 2695.23
Gnostic approach all these other groups

2691.42 --> 2699.16
got involved into building the final

2695.23 --> 2702.1
product and they probably did respect

2699.16 --> 2705.73
the the power of it and maybe feared at

2702.1 --> 2707.95
some of them but it's not what it

2705.73 --> 2709.9900000000002
originally was and I don't even know if

2707.95 --> 2713.1699999999996
the original thing was even that

2709.99 --> 2715.8999999999996
cohesive to the same degree it may still

2713.17 --> 2719.32
have been very Co magically cohesive in

2715.9 --> 2725.89
that there were still connections but

2719.32 --> 2727.27
not as as it is now I don't know and I'm

2725.89 --> 2729.0099999999998
not saying that because of it you

2727.27 --> 2733.2599999999998
shouldn't trust the Bible because I

2729.01 --> 2738.67
think that still a lot of the original

2733.26 --> 2741.67
root of its power is there and it's

2738.67 --> 2744.88
still pure it's just there's now other

2741.67 --> 2749.83
tests in between tests for the mind in

2744.88 --> 2753.6600000000003
the heart that involve the ones that

2749.83 --> 2753.66
have eventually put it all together

2760.6 --> 2764.08
that's septet

2765.8 --> 2774.8300000000004
maybe it's both truth the thing is about

2771.77 --> 2777.38
the idea of heaven and hell is we people

2774.83 --> 2779.5099999999998
human beings can really in their

2777.38 --> 2784.73
lifetime only reflect upon what they

2779.51 --> 2788.1800000000003
experience in their lifetime and it

2784.73 --> 2791.0
doesn't necessarily reveal if there is

2788.18 --> 2797.5099999999998
literally a hell or heaven afterward and

2791.0 --> 2801.53
how that would be but if in a way yeah

2797.51 --> 2805.25
the the Creator spirit through Jesus in

2801.53 --> 2807.32
or through other ways has revealed these

2805.25 --> 2810.38
things to be there well maybe they can

2807.32 --> 2816.04
be kind of like literally there but you

2810.38 --> 2816.04
we don't necessarily know what it means

2819.01 --> 2833.5400000000004
to be beyond living and how creation

2826.03 --> 2840.53
where creation really will put us our

2833.54 --> 2842.45
consciousness but I think to me yet the

2840.53 --> 2844.4300000000003
thing is I've had a lot of very

2842.45 --> 2847.1899999999996
spiritual personal experiences that were

2844.43 --> 2849.25
very rough on me at times and in the

2847.19 --> 2851.39
retrospect very confusing very

2849.25 --> 2853.58
contrasting experience and it kind of

2851.39 --> 2855.17
tend to jumble them up as one thing

2853.58 --> 2856.94
because it's almost like it's just one

2855.17 --> 2859.82
tape recording and even though the

2856.94 --> 2864.59
things were very different from

2859.82 --> 2866.98
different points in my life and in the

2864.59 --> 2871.31
way I experienced things at that time

2866.98 --> 2874.31
but I just thought that it's pretty much

2871.31 --> 2878.87
you have an is reuniting with the

2874.31 --> 2883.12
Creator getting back and and more dirt

2878.87 --> 2886.31
the more earthly burdens are in the way

2883.12 --> 2889.0099999999998
the longer it'll take to get there even

2886.31 --> 2892.46
after death if you can still abandon it

2889.01 --> 2895.82
or if it's just or the if the

2892.46 --> 2899.84
earthliness has taken you so you go back

2895.82 --> 2902.3300000000004
into the dark that kind of thing but but

2899.84 --> 2906.04
I've never literally experienced that

2902.33 --> 2906.04
it's just what I thought

2912.83 --> 2927.19
anyway yeah spiritual stuff oh all right

2922.66 --> 2930.3199999999997
yeah well Mental Illness right

2927.19 --> 2933.2000000000003
it's kind of an awful generalization if

2930.32 --> 2937.09
you're gonna say oh that makes me less

2933.2 --> 2941.71
viable to participate in society well

2937.09 --> 2945.38
maybe I've always thought it that yeah

2941.71 --> 2948.14
but does that make that untrue or does

2945.38 --> 2952.9100000000003
that make that just not noteworthy at

2948.14 --> 2955.7599999999998
all no I've had very special perceptor

2952.91 --> 2958.04
II experiences and the weirdest thing

2955.76 --> 2962.2900000000004
about it is that most of them were not

2958.04 --> 2965.81
even special hallucinatory drug trigger

2962.29 --> 2970.54
they were inherent usually under moments

2965.81 --> 2970.54
of great inner conflict but cute

2972.72 --> 2975.8199999999997
[Music]

2978.28 --> 2987.7900000000004
and yeah you can call me crazy you can

2983.11 --> 2990.01
call me crazy but yeah it is what it is

2987.79 --> 2992.59
and there's still a lot of interesting

2990.01 --> 2996.9900000000002
things concerning that and things that

2992.59 --> 2996.9900000000002
I've seen there and just

3002.349 --> 3006.089
that God gets mentioned is the point

3004.66 --> 3008.499
he's faithful

3006.089 --> 3011.919
yeah well Romans you know what they were

3008.499 --> 3017.019
the most confusing part about much of my

3011.919 --> 3023.3489999999997
visions was is that there's a certain

3017.019 --> 3025.4489999999996
individual like a face that is

3023.349 --> 3027.759
consistent it's not mine it's not anyone

3025.449 --> 3029.819
I've ever personally seen I think or

3027.759 --> 3032.89
that or maybe seen when I was very young

3029.819 --> 3035.14
but I've never seen them again I don't

3032.89 --> 3036.91
think he even lives anymore the physical

3035.14 --> 3041.439
person but maybe it could be just the

3036.91 --> 3044.319
face that this entity took but I was

3041.439 --> 3048.3689999999997
represented with somebody that really

3044.319 --> 3054.609
claimed to be the creator himself and I

3048.369 --> 3056.1690000000003
had huge doubts with that but as in that

3054.609 --> 3060.729
I didn't believe him at all I thought

3056.169 --> 3064.1189999999997
like that's no way just seems more like

3060.729 --> 3071.049
another entity in it how is that the

3064.119 --> 3073.3900000000003
Creator but I got doubts later that

3071.049 --> 3075.579
maybe he would be in some way or I

3073.39 --> 3077.14
really puzzled me even in that

3075.579 --> 3079.9
experience on the other side like what

3077.14 --> 3083.4089999999997
is this and is it is this like the Angel

3079.9 --> 3086.619
of Death or something because he seemed

3083.409 --> 3095.159
to be very interested at the end of all

3086.619 --> 3095.159
things or what is that he didn't

3095.86 --> 3102.35
it wasn't like for example you seem to

3099.41 --> 3107.48
have some kind of structure or law to

3102.35 --> 3118.7799999999997
him even a weird nobility even though he

3107.48 --> 3122.7400000000002
had no heart like he he said like no I

3118.78 --> 3128.63
took that away I can't do what I do if I

3122.74 --> 3133.31
had anyway yes this is just weird stuff

3128.63 --> 3137.4700000000003
I my my healer says is that it wasn't a

3133.31 --> 3140.84
Romanian spirit that was in a way

3137.47 --> 3143.33
megalomaniacal II imagining that they

3140.84 --> 3146.7200000000003
were that and apparently that can happen

3143.33 --> 3149.66
and so in a way he would fall in line

3146.72 --> 3153.2599999999998
with the frequency of the Angel of Death

3149.66 --> 3158.48
you could say but he was mostly just

3153.26 --> 3160.13
trying to trick himself into making me

3158.48 --> 3162.83
believe that he was the real absolute

3160.13 --> 3165.02
thing probably in order for me to try to

3162.83 --> 3166.97
get the worship him in some way but I

3165.02 --> 3173.66
wouldn't do that I never did that it's

3166.97 --> 3179.3599999999997
another fist rule is that don't worship

3173.66 --> 3183.2
anything worship the principle worship

3179.36 --> 3187.46
the frequency worship good deeds and all

3183.2 --> 3189.8799999999997
that evil worship do it and the doing it

3187.46 --> 3194.93
right is the worship really in the end

3189.88 --> 3200.06
but don't try to take individuals that

3194.93 --> 3202.3399999999997
present themselves on the same level as

3200.06 --> 3209.56
you like you and another don't worship

3202.34 --> 3212.63
them for because never respect them

3209.56 --> 3214.19
maybe help them it's very potentially

3212.63 --> 3217.67
dangerous if you don't know what they

3214.19 --> 3221.29
are but yeah don't go into kind of

3217.67 --> 3221.29
business or dealing or [Â __Â ]

3226.84 --> 3230.09
[Music]

3231.45 --> 3239.3089999999997
but what if bad things have happened to

3234.18 --> 3242.46
you it would be corrected it be correct

3239.309 --> 3245.7900000000004
to continue worship God I'm not

3242.46 --> 3250.38
worshipping God with little G for

3245.79 --> 3253.74
starters but yeah bad things have

3250.38 --> 3260.03
happened to me in a weird way in an

3253.74 --> 3264.2599999999998
unusual way and oh my god I've been very

3260.03 --> 3269.6600000000003
well hurt over that like why me

3264.26 --> 3273.2700000000004
but to then hate God is to underestimate

3269.66 --> 3277.319
what it is what you are and what those

3273.27 --> 3279.75
bad things will do to you and how if you

3277.319 --> 3282.7799999999997
don't just throw everything away you may

3279.75 --> 3287.73
actually adapt and well there's one

3282.78 --> 3289.53
thing I massively massively under upped

3287.73 --> 3292.29
and they're estimated my own adaptation

3289.53 --> 3295.13
abilities because I could adapt very

3292.29 --> 3297.99
quickly to little things but my feelings

3295.13 --> 3302.25
very hard in adaptation on the long run

3297.99 --> 3306.0299999999997
very very just I'm I'm just stuck like

3302.25 --> 3310.65
don't want to move want to be how I feel

3306.03 --> 3312.69
how I am so I thought it was just I was

3310.65 --> 3314.849
always going to be that literal that's

3312.69 --> 3317.339
what I thought and I underestimated I

3314.849 --> 3319.1400000000003
felt like yeah this is like a curse but

3317.339 --> 3322.23
I didn't know that was just gonna take a

3319.14 --> 3327.589
lot more time to get over that and I had

3322.23 --> 3330.7400000000002
to sit through it a lot of life the is

3327.589 --> 3337.109
in a way I guess suffering suffering

3330.74 --> 3339.569
personal suffering and then that if you

3337.109 --> 3341.22
do it right something to you if you do

3339.569 --> 3344.849
it right that doesn't mean inflict stuff

3341.22 --> 3348.2099999999996
to yourself if you just accept it and

3344.849 --> 3353.4
try to deal with it and don't despair

3348.21 --> 3355.349
just try to find something new then

3353.4 --> 3358.799
eventually like the burden of it will

3355.349 --> 3362.1600000000003
lessen and more room will certainly open

3358.799 --> 3364.67
up and because of even the heavy burden

3362.16 --> 3368.49
that you wore before that

3364.67 --> 3372.09
you'll be more eager and more precise

3368.49 --> 3374.6099999999997
with how you build up new things it's

3372.09 --> 3376.79
it's quite a contrast and so that is how

3374.61 --> 3379.98
I've come to the conclusion is that

3376.79 --> 3386.57
there's an offset between how much life

3379.98 --> 3386.57
punishes you and how much you can do

3388.19 --> 3394.08
what you can really do with your life

3390.48 --> 3397.41
and if you try to avoid the punishments

3394.08 --> 3399.7999999999997
of life then you will accomplish less in

3397.41 --> 3399.7999999999997
the end

3406.57 --> 3412.9300000000003
yeah it's kind of general anyway I'm

3409.09 --> 3418.03
gonna round out the show I hope you guys
