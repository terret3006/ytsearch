Europe yeah yeah I'm doing I'm doing

128.38 --> 130.619
great

131.31 --> 143.25
what's a yeah been if and usual day

134.71 --> 146.62
yesterday for me but all is well yeah

143.25 --> 150.19
yeah I it I basically didn't have any

146.62 --> 153.31
beers yesterday I kind of because of

150.19 --> 156.94
budget reasons also decided to kind of

153.31 --> 160.72
like drop that so I could get around

156.94 --> 165.49
worse yeah it's just like my new mine it

160.72 --> 170.11
amounts but yeah I every euro kinda

165.49 --> 171.73000000000002
counts now at least until tomorrow so

170.11 --> 175.68
there's not gonna be any beers for me

171.73 --> 178.63
today either but yeah I feel

175.68 --> 180.489
surprisingly good like yesterday there

178.63 --> 183.09
was a bit of a moment in the afternoon

180.489 --> 188.89000000000001
where I yeah where am I

183.09 --> 191.47
like I say my my stomach all that it was

188.89 --> 193.11999999999998
kind of expecting me like yeah this time

191.47 --> 194.59
you're supposed to drink a beer you know

193.12 --> 196.9
that's when it's the most appealing to

194.59 --> 200.32
me and I in my stomach kind of upset

196.9 --> 203.05
that it didn't arrive and then when I

200.32 --> 208.51
had dinner it was like well I'm used to

203.05 --> 214.69
being more alkalis now but yeah I got

208.51 --> 217.87
through that and I yeah it's been oh

214.69 --> 221.769
it's been a while since I just didn't

217.87 --> 225.89000000000001
drink anything at all because apparently

221.769 --> 230.37
just even two beers matters

225.89 --> 238.23
and yeah well after two more after today

230.37 --> 239.1
I'm just gonna see if if yeah if I can

238.23 --> 245.60999999999999
keep this up

239.1 --> 247.68
Oh am i quiet no I'm not quiet my volume

245.61 --> 248.3
should be exactly where it is where it

247.68 --> 261.90000000000003
should be

248.3 --> 263.49
right so yeah yesterday yesterday I

261.9 --> 266.94
don't know if you caught me

263.49 --> 269.94
oh the chat why it's Sunday morning hm

266.94 --> 272.73
this always happens anyway yeah those

269.94 --> 276.24
who are have arrived already a stone

272.73 --> 281.52000000000004
monkey 3d was first Amanda young and HM

276.24 --> 282.69
and dank so good to see you for the rest

281.52 --> 287.03999999999996
of all start rolling in

282.69 --> 291.11
anyway yeah said yesterday that I was

287.04 --> 295.89000000000004
probably not gonna have a show today but

291.11 --> 298.74
yeah eventually it turned out that it

295.89 --> 301.14
was cancelled again the DND it was

298.74 --> 302.91
cancelled again too bad in a way because

301.14 --> 305.37
it's such a beautiful day it would have

302.91 --> 307.71000000000004
been great but yeah one of my players

305.37 --> 312.59000000000003
had a very serious cold and everything

307.71 --> 312.59
and yeah it's a new location also

313.34 --> 318.0
because we don't have any room at

316.44 --> 320.79
anybody's home at this point

318.0 --> 325.919
unfortunately to play so we're going to

320.79 --> 329.69
play at like a sort of a restaurant but

325.919 --> 332.69
nobody of us have been there before

329.69 --> 332.69
anyway

334.45 --> 338.92
yeah that was canceled so it's just

336.7 --> 341.2
gonna be a full show today I'm gonna aim

338.92 --> 347.86
at two hours but maybe one and a half

341.2 --> 352.03
we'll see also yeah I had the first

347.86 --> 354.37
streaming of the ever after show at the

352.03 --> 360.4
Nite Owl Nite Owl number three finally

354.37 --> 362.65
after what is it a year so I hope you

360.4 --> 365.2
caught that and if you haven't then I

362.65 --> 368.83
suggest you watch it and yeah any kind

365.2 --> 373.02
of technical comments about just the

368.83 --> 376.45
presentation of it I'd like to hear it I

373.02 --> 379.29999999999995
got a lot of criticism from ballers my

376.45 --> 380.59
god like the entire chat was just filled

379.3 --> 386.8
with ballers I don't know where

380.59 --> 390.96
everybody else when this is anyway yeah

386.8 --> 390.96000000000004
yeah happy-ever-after show it was with

391.47 --> 397.15000000000003
grantee Tony Adam a lot of Adam

394.36 --> 402.55
especially the second half because it

397.15 --> 404.53
was almost 2 hours and yeah also one

402.55 --> 408.34000000000003
little convenience is that I could kind

404.53 --> 409.65999999999997
of skip forward in between when yeah

408.34 --> 411.54999999999995
when they were not talking about

409.66 --> 413.47
anything interesting just back and forth

411.55 --> 416.2
about something technical without even

413.47 --> 417.82000000000005
saying anything about it so yeah it was

416.2 --> 420.28
good it was it was an interesting

417.82 --> 429.63
experience I'd love to do that more

420.28 --> 432.7
regularly hello Amanda young morning hey

429.63 --> 437.26
Thank You Sean Tibet's good morning for

432.7 --> 439.89
the 2-pound superjet the nation and the

437.26 --> 439.89
cool pear

443.14 --> 458.41999999999996
hello Abby Kim good morning so yeah what

454.1 --> 460.70000000000005
did I watch yesterday there was a lot

458.42 --> 465.53000000000003
going on but I didn't catch it all to be

460.7 --> 469.34
fair I was yeah I had to pretty much be

465.53 --> 473.57
there all of the time during the ever

469.34 --> 478.19
after show or during the night I'll show

473.57 --> 480.92
and didn't yeah I probably streamed over

478.19 --> 486.02
some other streams but anyway besides

480.92 --> 489.05
all of that I did actually manage to

486.02 --> 496.21
catch Owen Benjamin twice and was great

489.05 --> 499.87
both at the times this time let's see

496.21 --> 502.13
missed out on left to fill unfortunately

499.87 --> 505.06
there was so much going on it's yeah as

502.13 --> 505.06
always on Saturday

507.41 --> 514.1
got a bit of ugly Jew deal I also think

512.15 --> 517.6899999999999
you were shopping around it oh no no not

514.1 --> 517.69
this time anyway

525.08 --> 535.85
why doesn't the notification list why

531.03 --> 535.85
isn't it longer it's annoying anyway

543.56 --> 553.7299999999999
I'll try it through it browser history

545.87 --> 555.98
oh right yeah no I remember it wrong

553.73 --> 557.69
there I didn't see to own Benjamin

555.98 --> 561.5
Hangouts I was basically one but the

557.69 --> 565.49
first one it had an unusual amount of

561.5 --> 569.3
glitches like so bad I yeah that's why

565.49 --> 571.3100000000001
he cut it off pretty quickly although it

569.3 --> 573.62
did last at least 20 minutes but just

571.31 --> 577.8199999999999
didn't get a word of it because it was

573.62 --> 579.83
so glitchy he supposed to play the video

577.82 --> 582.74
didn't hear word of it or or saw

579.83 --> 584.5400000000001
anything about it but then yeah he took

582.74 --> 586.97
the computer inside the laptop or

584.54 --> 589.76
whatever he's using and then yeah the

586.97 --> 594.7
next stream was just perfect there was

589.76 --> 594.7
some good stuff some good gravy

595.03 --> 606.97
yes Shum Tibet's my weather is great let

600.02 --> 616.16
me show it again so beautiful blue skies

606.97 --> 624.86
clouds a lot of Sun barely any wind no

616.16 --> 627.3
chemtrails today hello Michael Roark see

624.86 --> 640.83
if check Oh

627.3 --> 655.92
robbed keen George Sanford hello Nathan

640.83 --> 660.6500000000001
Oakley calling dresser yeah green tea

655.92 --> 660.65
again until ways I forgot to say yes

662.51 --> 668.34
yeah also I cleaned up my my teacup so

666.69 --> 671.7600000000001
now suddenly you can see the color of

668.34 --> 674.12
the tea and it's more yellow than dark

671.76 --> 674.12
brown

691.02 --> 697.29
yeah yesterday I think I forgot to give

694.41 --> 700.98
it a name but that was that was all

697.29 --> 706.3389999999999
talking so long about gammas and alphas

700.98 --> 706.339
and deltas and omegas

713.21 --> 719.1800000000001
Tana olen Benjamin also talked just a

716.06 --> 724.3699999999999
lot about gammas and like gamma tendency

719.18 --> 726.89
and it really is it just seems like the

724.37 --> 731.74
gamma mindset in a way is almost a

726.89 --> 731.74
combination where the individual is just

731.83 --> 737.4200000000001
stepping yeah

734.09 --> 741.6700000000001
on the inside doing all things kind of

737.42 --> 744.4399999999999
stepping away from logos and therefore

741.67 --> 747.7299999999999
Lucifer like now I'm talking ethereal

744.44 --> 752.6300000000001
right Lucifer and everyone and all that

747.73 --> 754.7
well Lucifer would then typically seduce

752.63 --> 757.85
them to be the secret King that is what

754.7 --> 761.69
the the spirit of Lucifer does the in

757.85 --> 764.21
the rudolf steiner setup right so that's

761.69 --> 767.3900000000001
on one side on the inside it guides the

764.21 --> 769.3000000000001
person almost entirely and then the

767.39 --> 772.24
methods that come out of it are all

769.3 --> 777.56
aromanian is just attack attack attack

772.24 --> 781.37
destroy undermine and so yeah it's like

777.56 --> 786.8299999999999
the gamma personality is just naturally

781.37 --> 790.19
very polluted by entities right by the

786.83 --> 791.6800000000001
spirit by bad entities that dictate its

790.19 --> 798.8000000000001
behavior and that's what makes it

791.68 --> 800.15
robotic almost and very predictable but

798.8 --> 802.5699999999999
yeah that that's just a weird

800.15 --> 806.39
realization that the character types

802.57 --> 810.2900000000001
just have natural types of pollution

806.39 --> 812.4499999999999
that's what makes it that and then yeah

810.29 --> 817.67
you can technically escape from that in

812.45 --> 819.9200000000001
a way and act something out something

817.67 --> 822.68
else and then you can turn into a good

819.92 --> 827.24
delta that's a good starting point at

822.68 --> 830.75
least but yeah I would just wonder like

827.24 --> 833.21
how dynamic is this this range of

830.75 --> 837.44
personalities and how do is shift work

833.21 --> 839.51
and is it that I am an Omega because I

837.44 --> 841.6800000000001
can shift I think I remember Owen

839.51 --> 845.249
Benjamin say about that

841.68 --> 848.8689999999999
because yeah I I used to be in that

845.249 --> 851.1890000000001
position where where lucifer was

848.869 --> 853.519
forwarding me a lot of ideas and I did

851.189 --> 860.3389999999999
take the bait very enthusiastically

853.519 --> 864.66
although I would never be a gamma

860.339 --> 868.0500000000001
attacker never been like that I only do

864.66 --> 870.179
that in in yeah in triggered mode ivar I

868.05 --> 872.519
only did that in triggered moments and

870.179 --> 874.619
it would be extremely humiliating so

872.519 --> 878.189
I've been always trying to avoid that

874.619 --> 880.0500000000001
just didn't always work out and then

878.189 --> 881.429
eventually when I got control of it

880.05 --> 884.8499999999999
which was pretty early on actually

881.429 --> 885.179
probably around my 20s very proud of

884.85 --> 888.089
that

885.179 --> 891.8389999999999
then instead I would resort to another

888.089 --> 895.73
method rather did like diplomacy hold

891.839 --> 900.269
back the negative energy and then try to

895.73 --> 902.79
transform it into effective a diplomatic

900.269 --> 904.889
approach and yeah it was started out

902.79 --> 906.54
very clumsy with that but yeah when

904.889 --> 908.249
you're very young you know everybody's

906.54 --> 909.99
clumsy and fooling around nobody cares

908.249 --> 912.36
about that everybody just does whatever

909.99 --> 915.059
they want I was training myself very

912.36 --> 919.11
seriously to do these things to change

915.059 --> 920.55
my attitude and it worked and now I'm

919.11 --> 923.429
kind of a diplomat

920.55 --> 924.319
but hey when I noticed that it's not

923.429 --> 928.139
working

924.319 --> 932.399
yeah yeah then I become more like a

928.139 --> 934.499
joker and I don't know it's not a not a

932.399 --> 938.79
joke or movie Joker

934.499 --> 942.2090000000001
thanks this is but just I big I start

938.79 --> 945.5999999999999
the clown around start naming and poking

942.209 --> 948.7199999999999
with jokes but I try to not make it too

945.6 --> 955.66
nasty unless I get really pissed just I

948.72 --> 958.03
reflect with what I do but

955.66 --> 960.37
yeah it's not really the baseline gamma

958.03 --> 963.01
because baseline gamma indeed is just

960.37 --> 965.92
it's I Romanian the output is aromanian

963.01 --> 969.91
the guide is Lucifer the output is a

965.92 --> 972.78
Romanian method and that will include

969.91 --> 979.0899999999999
doublethink because there's nothing more

972.78 --> 981.9399999999999
aromanian than doublethink yeah

979.09 --> 983.74
everyone is kind of like the spirit of

981.94 --> 990.22
the reversed world it's the spirit of

983.74 --> 992.91
the end the it tries to oppose logos in

990.22 --> 996.45
the most blunt way lucifer tries to

992.91 --> 999.91
replace logos right

996.45 --> 1003.1800000000001
Ahriman just wants to get rid of it all

999.91 --> 1005.39
that's that's kind of like the essential

1003.18 --> 1005.39
difference

1009.24 --> 1016.0790000000001
anyway in the ethereal sense so this is

1011.999 --> 1019.9200000000001
not necessarily tying into yeah the

1016.079 --> 1025.049
religious approaches of luciferianism or

1019.92 --> 1028.11
or even Satanism but yeah I don't know

1025.049 --> 1030.929
maybe there is maybe there is some kind

1028.11 --> 1034.079
of a sense to that that Luciferians are

1030.929 --> 1037.0790000000002
more typically just one of replaced

1034.079 --> 1041.6989999999998
logos and Satanists are just like no we

1037.079 --> 1045.62
just want to destroy it but maybe that's

1041.699 --> 1045.6200000000001
my interpretation of it

1049.66 --> 1059.22
Lucifer is 74 what yeah I don't know

1058.059 --> 1062.98
what that means

1059.22 --> 1065.13
ESP power one one seven and welcome to a

1062.98 --> 1072.15
joke

1065.13 --> 1072.15
right john watson also Martin Ellen

1087.63 --> 1094.0
Lucifer lied mirror

1089.52 --> 1096.37
well isn't that even metaphorically

1094.0 --> 1098.68
you know the light bear so what is the

1096.37 --> 1102.01
light isn't the light basically a symbol

1098.68 --> 1107.17
for logos the the best energy the the

1102.01 --> 1109.41
spark of the created he yet the real the

1107.17 --> 1114.43
energy that designed it all and

1109.41 --> 1119.38
therefore works best the light so

1114.43 --> 1122.23
Lucifer wants to bear the light he wants

1119.38 --> 1130.0900000000001
to but he want he doesn't just bear the

1122.23 --> 1132.6100000000001
light he also tries to change it but to

1130.09 --> 1135.52
people that aren't so finely attuned yet

1132.61 --> 1139.59
he will seem like he is carrying logos

1135.52 --> 1143.77
but people may misunderstand it and

1139.59 --> 1147.49
therefore be seduced by the spirit of

1143.77 --> 1150.73
Lucifer get deviating ideas still from a

1147.49 --> 1154.6
a good perspective a good meaning

1150.73 --> 1156.85
perspective probably starting out but

1154.6 --> 1159.8799999999999
yeah as you just make mistakes in your

1156.85 --> 1161.82
approach that side effects start to

1159.88 --> 1165.7
happen you start to get the yeah the the

1161.82 --> 1169.33
punishment from stepping away it always

1165.7 --> 1171.49
happens that might not happen very

1169.33 --> 1174.55
quickly because the intent is still good

1171.49 --> 1177.73
so it's not that bad just not that bad

1174.55 --> 1185.37
it's still not good but I hope you

1177.73 --> 1185.3700000000001
understand what I mean okay

1191.39 --> 1199.3090000000002
yes hm you could say that it's almost

1197.39 --> 1201.17
yeah you could say that later Oh in a

1199.309 --> 1203.96
way and you can say that metaphorically

1201.17 --> 1209.0
definitely like the true light the true

1203.96 --> 1211.91
logos in my opinion kind of is God

1209.0 --> 1216.89
you know Alpha Omega it is him it is the

1211.91 --> 1219.559
essence it is the essence of what shaped

1216.89 --> 1223.49
it all or what designed it also that

1219.559 --> 1229.49
essence is him I don't know does that

1223.49 --> 1235.82
make any sense maybe it is just see it

1229.49 --> 1239.45
from a serial angle so yeah if a person

1235.82 --> 1242.45
walks that then he isn't God but he

1239.45 --> 1245.8600000000001
literally as they say has God with them

1242.45 --> 1249.8600000000001
he carries that essence that energy and

1245.86 --> 1254.57
well the the metaphorical the ethereal

1249.86 --> 1257.75
God essence basically so yeah see I

1254.57 --> 1263.6
don't know I am pretty dynamic about

1257.75 --> 1266.03
approaching this and I think I'm really

1263.6 --> 1270.4399999999998
onto something with this but I'm very

1266.03 --> 1272.36
careful not as they say as I've been

1270.44 --> 1275.15
warning about the Bible even before as

1272.36 --> 1277.28
to this now because of this specific

1275.15 --> 1279.14
approach I'm not gonna say oh I'm gonna

1277.28 --> 1281.27
discard all the other things I'm gonna

1279.14 --> 1284.21
discard the literal interpretation I'm

1281.27 --> 1286.94
gonna or discard that discard this

1284.21 --> 1289.91
approach no I'm just saying this is

1286.94 --> 1293.419
something that I it's kind of almost my

1289.91 --> 1296.8600000000001
study it's my study of the path and it's

1293.419 --> 1302.1200000000001
not so much about reading it's about

1296.86 --> 1304.9699999999998
feeling it's about feeling and the

1302.12 --> 1308.1689999999999
intuition and fine-tuning and cleaning

1304.97 --> 1308.169
up the senses

1310.89 --> 1316.7700000000002
because yeah at the same time Bible

1313.35 --> 1319.62
literalist you know her Bible studies

1316.77 --> 1324.51
just still incredible I could never

1319.62 --> 1326.6999999999998
match that on her level you know so but

1324.51 --> 1329.82
that is the Bible literal it and it is

1326.7 --> 1332.16
fascinating and it is viable to me it is

1329.82 --> 1334.47
I consider it viable it just teaches me

1332.16 --> 1337.77
a lot it teaches me a lot about rules

1334.47 --> 1339.47
yeah about rules and contracts that's

1337.77 --> 1343.83
what's so amazing about that approach

1339.47 --> 1346.6200000000001
well I approach it from another I

1343.83 --> 1351.8999999999999
approach it from the esoteric angle

1346.62 --> 1359.7299999999998
she's yeah purely that the esoteric

1351.9 --> 1363.38
angle the ethereal angle no yeah

1359.73 --> 1367.1
esoteric also refers back to the symbols

1363.38 --> 1371.2990000000002
well when then when you approach symbols

1367.1 --> 1374.07
esoterically then in a way you are

1371.299 --> 1377.809
working with a theory with the ethereal

1374.07 --> 1381.48
in most cases unless it it symbolizes

1377.809 --> 1384.24
another physical action that is kind of

1381.48 --> 1388.26
concealed within the symbol that can

1384.24 --> 1392.429
also be but yeah I deal with the theory

1388.26 --> 1397.29
a lot with the other dimension you could

1392.429 --> 1401.1000000000001
say who the other dimension where I've

1397.29 --> 1402.8999999999999
had many experiences or one singular

1401.1 --> 1408.9499999999998
very long experience that span my

1402.9 --> 1408.95
lifetime I think it seemed that way

1411.74 --> 1417.6200000000001
you know what the weirdest thing is it's

1414.86 --> 1421.34
like every time I bump into a new game

1417.62 --> 1425.029
that I get really into I get shocked

1421.34 --> 1427.309
first you know why because I remember

1425.029 --> 1429.5
being confronted with that game in the

1427.309 --> 1433.1299999999999
in the dark world in the on the other

1429.5 --> 1435.71
side and being fearful like oh this is

1433.13 --> 1437.6000000000001
gonna consume my life and I was

1435.71 --> 1439.909
confronted with like I think all the

1437.6 --> 1442.1299999999999
games I've ever played and I can't

1439.909 --> 1444.23
remember it's no use remembering a game

1442.13 --> 1446.75
that you had that's not there yet but

1444.23 --> 1449.63
there's been several games now that I've

1446.75 --> 1452.679
played a lot that I've when I first

1449.63 --> 1456.23
bumped into them I was shocked because I

1452.679 --> 1458.99
remembered it from a vision now one of

1456.23 --> 1461.8990000000001
these games which is it's kind of a

1458.99 --> 1466.97
weird weapon game called battle for the

1461.899 --> 1469.1299999999999
galaxy I even vividly remember that and

1466.97 --> 1473.0
was kind of like where is it where is it

1469.13 --> 1475.5490000000002
before it came out in before before I

1473.0 --> 1479.029
bumped into it and that was now four

1475.549 --> 1482.299
years ago that was very shocking to me

1479.029 --> 1484.37
that I would literally remember like oh

1482.299 --> 1486.649
there was this and there was that this

1484.37 --> 1491.3899999999999
is how it worked like it's almost like

1486.649 --> 1493.9399999999998
I've seen the designer build it that was

1491.39 --> 1497.0
a very very fascinating experience and

1493.94 --> 1500.27
that was the most vivid one but yeah

1497.0 --> 1503.12
with a lot of other games it seemed like

1500.27 --> 1505.1299999999999
that game I consumed me a lot it and

1503.12 --> 1506.899
therefore also confused me in the real

1505.13 --> 1509.659
life experience and the other games

1506.899 --> 1512.1789999999999
I got confronted with it but I think I

1509.659 --> 1514.3990000000001
realized from the Battle of the galaxy

1512.179 --> 1519.5900000000001
experience in the very dark world trip

1514.399 --> 1522.049
that engaging their into it a lot isn't

1519.59 --> 1524.36
really healthy for me in the real world

1522.049 --> 1527.3799999999999
so I would just be confronted with it

1524.36 --> 1530.86
realize be worried and then step away

1527.38 --> 1534.5
not really dig into the whole thing very

1530.86 --> 1538.07
extensively so that's why after that one

1534.5 --> 1541.24
game I think I haven't had real in-depth

1538.07 --> 1541.24
of experiences

1541.44 --> 1552.44
ha now that got a little weird yeah I

1552.62 --> 1560.9699999999998
don't know how I even switched the games

1555.42 --> 1571.7
in my visions yeah oh yeah I was yeah

1560.97 --> 1571.7
esoterics what are you talking about it

1572.9 --> 1576.8000000000002
yeah John Watson's there's definitely

1575.55 --> 1580.5
evidence of Jesus

1576.8 --> 1583.11
absolutely historically very wide from

1580.5 --> 1585.39
several cultural angles that conflict

1583.11 --> 1587.9099999999999
yeah yeah but that's what happens over

1585.39 --> 1591.9
time with several different cultures in

1587.91 --> 1593.73
different regions they they may have

1591.9 --> 1596.0700000000002
conflicts during the periods and they

1593.73 --> 1598.14
may rearrange some of their history in

1596.07 --> 1600.27
different manners not leave out certain

1598.14 --> 1603.66
things that others have because of

1600.27 --> 1608.0
political reasons right right so from in

1603.66 --> 1612.23
India there's evidence of this Jesus

1608.0 --> 1617.27
yeah in the whole Middle East there is

1612.23 --> 1619.98
historical evidence and just records

1617.27 --> 1624.35
there is evidence there is absolutely

1619.98 --> 1628.77
evidence there was a a person that was

1624.35 --> 1635.3899999999999
famous and infamous with government that

1628.77 --> 1639.15
called Jesus or yahushua if you will and

1635.39 --> 1641.3700000000001
yeah that figure really existed and even

1639.15 --> 1642.96
my vision this is web for whatever

1641.37 --> 1646.1399999999999
that's worth the you guys to me it's

1642.96 --> 1651.33
worth something I was definitely I've

1646.14 --> 1657.1100000000001
visited him in spirit or as used not the

1651.33 --> 1661.1399999999999
Creator but that flesh the the avatar

1657.11 --> 1662.9399999999998
that of Jesus like his separated spirit

1661.14 --> 1664.8600000000001
on the other side

1662.94 --> 1667.3200000000002
I guess that's that's probably what that

1664.86 --> 1670.4699999999998
was if I'm correct or it was just

1667.32 --> 1675.3
complete delusion but it seemed very

1670.47 --> 1684.6200000000001
real it did feel extremely like Jesus

1675.3 --> 1687.24
or whatever I feel Jesus was yeah but

1684.62 --> 1691.35
yeah I'm confident that there definitely

1687.24 --> 1697.7
was that that person now everything that

1691.35 --> 1704.55
is said but of him by people afterward

1697.7 --> 1706.6200000000001
now that is something else you know even

1704.55 --> 1709.47
like the cornerstones of Christianity

1706.62 --> 1712.2299999999998
like the big switches look the contract

1709.47 --> 1714.96
change the Covenant change and the

1712.23 --> 1717.72
literal incarnation and there and the

1714.96 --> 1725.7
resurrection these things you know are

1717.72 --> 1728.55
these essential for the path well in a

1725.7 --> 1733.8600000000001
way because of technical backdrop

1728.55 --> 1735.99
reasons why because what does it matter

1733.86 --> 1740.52
if you walk the path when you are bound

1735.99 --> 1742.8
to very specific rules you know that's

1740.52 --> 1746.7
almost impossible so that is why it is

1742.8 --> 1750.78
still important but as for how the

1746.7 --> 1754.89
physical things actually transpired or

1750.78 --> 1759.42
like yeah a lot of this can simply be

1754.89 --> 1761.8200000000002
ethereal and how do you convey that well

1759.42 --> 1768.3000000000002
you built kind of like a metaphorical

1761.82 --> 1771.6299999999999
mythology of it and thus that matter did

1768.3 --> 1773.7
all of those things really well not the

1771.63 --> 1777.2700000000002
things that Jesus are supposedly did in

1773.7 --> 1779.76
his life story but the the big switches

1777.27 --> 1785.19
that could have just taken place out of

1779.76 --> 1787.47
sight but how do you convey that

1785.19 --> 1789.42
realization of the change well how did

1787.47 --> 1792.75
the prophets convey it or get it

1789.42 --> 1797.21
conveyed to them well by the by the

1792.75 --> 1797.21
whole story it's it's so complicated

1798.55 --> 1807.11
but I don't get held up upon people that

1804.07 --> 1808.34
that would say but Miller maybe he's not

1807.11 --> 1811.3999999999999
God in the flesh

1808.34 --> 1814.4599999999998
what is God in the flesh what does that

1811.4 --> 1818.99
yeah do we have to take it so freakin

1814.46 --> 1821.63
literal or could it simply be that the

1818.99 --> 1826.07
design just allowed this person how

1821.63 --> 1829.3100000000002
every whether he was like born without

1826.07 --> 1834.1599999999999
procreation or if he was doesn't matter

1829.31 --> 1835.3999999999999
to me personally it really doesn't but

1834.16 --> 1838.01
yeah

1835.4 --> 1841.46
I'm pretty confident that the design

1838.01 --> 1844.54
worked its way because of prophecy also

1841.46 --> 1848.0900000000001
because I think that that does exist

1844.54 --> 1850.55
like the design does build towards

1848.09 --> 1853.76
things that's how God designed it and

1850.55 --> 1856.52
that is what that Jesus was basically

1853.76 --> 1859.37
always going to arrive that there was

1856.52 --> 1861.17
the perfect moment where a certain type

1859.37 --> 1864.4099999999999
of genetics could you could call it jus

1861.17 --> 1866.8000000000002
netic it's probably different that that

1864.41 --> 1871.27
person would arrive that's just

1866.8 --> 1874.82
perfectly suited for the perfect logos

1871.27 --> 1879.32
including not just logos because before

1874.82 --> 1882.74
logos was the old logos presumably right

1879.32 --> 1885.47
the old rules but the perfect essence

1882.74 --> 1888.68
for the new rules for the new covenant

1885.47 --> 1890.96
the perfect path that's what he was

1888.68 --> 1893.15
designed for that is what he came

1890.96 --> 1897.47
together for to carry that perfect

1893.15 --> 1902.39
essence and convey it now whether that

1897.47 --> 1907.9
makes Jesus the contract or simply a

1902.39 --> 1912.6100000000001
vessel to relay and prove the contract

1907.9 --> 1912.6100000000001
that is another matter

1916.419 --> 1931.219
so yeah I hope that gives a little bit

1920.629 --> 1932.889
of a clearer sight on how I see it from

1931.219 --> 1943.549
yeah again from a more esoteric

1932.889 --> 1946.869
perspective you know I that's a lot of

1943.549 --> 1946.869
eights ESP power

1961.76 --> 1969.71
no but yeah chou-heung cat I know yeah

1964.64 --> 1973.0400000000002
you're a you're devout Christian yeah

1969.71 --> 1975.71
and you're correct with what you say you

1973.04 --> 1978.92
know people that awaken God just become

1975.71 --> 1981.23
self-evident or you have to actively put

1978.92 --> 1984.23
the blinders on and then you they avoid

1981.23 --> 1985.76
the path potentially for Luciferian

1984.23 --> 1988.58
reasons if you're flattered because

1985.76 --> 1991.16
you're already trying to escape from the

1988.58 --> 1994.04
pure lies from the pure first world so

1991.16 --> 1995.48
your that's not a Romanian that doesn't

1994.04 --> 1999.68
mean that you're then gonna really

1995.48 --> 2003.01
figure out the real logos so yeah

1999.68 --> 2005.71
there's definitely a lot of Luciferian

2003.01 --> 2007.57
influence with many individuals on the

2005.71 --> 2010.95
flatterer scene that doesn't make them

2007.57 --> 2013.4199999999998
evil people it just makes them troubled

2010.95 --> 2015.94
they have difficulty figuring it out

2013.42 --> 2017.8000000000002
sounds it sounds denigrating I don't

2015.94 --> 2019.5700000000002
mean it that way it's natural that's

2017.8 --> 2022.6299999999999
just the challenges of being a human

2019.57 --> 2038.98
okay and doing this that's just what it

2022.63 --> 2041.2900000000002
is but yet the original question John

2038.98 --> 2043.9
Watson asked was there or what he

2041.29 --> 2046.48
claimed was that there is no proof of

2043.9 --> 2050.53
Jesus and there is very much so

2046.48 --> 2053.5
historical now whatever the is esoteric

2050.53 --> 2058.6000000000004
thinks that you ascribe to Jesus that's

2053.5 --> 2060.64
another matter but look buddy even the

2058.6 --> 2065.86
other religions for whatever their

2060.64 --> 2069.1
approach their essence is worth right

2065.86 --> 2071.86
and how much logos are they contain they

2069.1 --> 2077.44
even recognize that Jesus would existed

2071.86 --> 2080.35
okay they did you can find references so

2077.44 --> 2083.08
get over it buddy unless you're just

2080.35 --> 2085.75
gonna shove everything out of the door

2083.08 --> 2088.45
which atheists very typically do it's

2085.75 --> 2091.21
like oh can we interpret this as

2088.45 --> 2093.8399999999997
religion does it deny our beliefs yeah

2091.21 --> 2098.28
that means we're gonna discard it all

2093.84 --> 2100.17
yeah I know but for anybody that doesn't

2098.28 --> 2103.8500000000004
want to do that right

2100.17 --> 2107.07
it doesn't embrace arimin to that level

2103.85 --> 2108.96
but they realize it or not yeah they're

2107.07 --> 2112.8
gonna have a lot of historical

2108.96 --> 2121.98
references to Jesus so sorry sorry John

2112.8 --> 2124.92
Watson you need to drop it yeah and the

2121.98 --> 2129.65
Bible in Babel is absolutely not

2124.92 --> 2129.65
the same thing don't don't go there

2129.88 --> 2137.79
[Music]

2155.059 --> 2170.789
somebody talking about sprites mr.

2158.609 --> 2178.0389999999998
Charlie boy oh wait you're not way to

2170.789 --> 2178.039
change your name okay let me undo that I

2178.579 --> 2182.6600000000003
don't know why you change your name

2187.88 --> 2195.98
where you no longer call to Fyodor

2191.15 --> 2199.04
Dostoevsky I don't know why you brought

2195.98 --> 2213.56
up sprites you know did I use the word

2199.04 --> 2215.15
sprite where that's right chou-heung cat

2213.56 --> 2217.58
you're you're totally correct

2215.15 --> 2220.25
you can't Orwell the super net you can

2217.58 --> 2223.0099999999998
even prove the ethereal with Natural

2220.25 --> 2227.42
Sciences let's not bring supernaturalism

2223.01 --> 2231.5
into it because ethereal is already

2227.42 --> 2233.42
there and you can't prove that even

2231.5 --> 2237.02
though people can some people have the

2233.42 --> 2239.33
senses for it right and what do you

2237.02 --> 2241.43
believe in that in the supernatural is

2239.33 --> 2245.92
another matter I think that the

2241.43 --> 2249.02
supernatural is it's in a way also

2245.92 --> 2253.16
misunderstood I think a lot of it is

2249.02 --> 2255.5
just like beings on the other side

2253.16 --> 2260.2999999999997
including potentially the creator

2255.5 --> 2269.51
himself or another deal the Angels in

2260.3 --> 2271.88
Avatar for that and so yeah I think even

2269.51 --> 2275.4500000000003
the supernatural could have an ethereal

2271.88 --> 2277.58
explanation that would not disregard the

2275.45 --> 2281.0
Creator mind you it would simply give a

2277.58 --> 2285.59
framework for what is going on how that

2281.0 --> 2288.08
can happen more because supernatural

2285.59 --> 2291.17
with the technicals about supernatural

2288.08 --> 2294.5
is that there is no physical explanation

2291.17 --> 2298.13
for it there's not even really a like

2294.5 --> 2300.71
what is chemically or energetically

2298.13 --> 2302.33
going on there's just nothing there they

2300.71 --> 2306.38
don't give it it's almost like they're

2302.33 --> 2312.83
scared of it so I wonder just that I can

2306.38 --> 2315.23
think of ways but yeah then again that's

2312.83 --> 2318.65
just it is all speculation and mind you

2315.23 --> 2321.23
because in a way you can't prove the

2318.65 --> 2325.9700000000003
ethereal either it is just kind of a

2321.23 --> 2328.31
duction based work and yeah if you're

2325.97 --> 2330.859
lucky or unlucky depending on your

2328.31 --> 2334.609
perspective or your experiences you can

2330.859 --> 2340.5699999999997
have personal experiences that reflect

2334.609 --> 2340.5699999999997
upon that that's just it

2361.83 --> 2369.12
oh really John Watson well did Jesus

2365.73 --> 2371.25
Christ tell people to do that did he

2369.12 --> 2373.29
John Watson or are you straw Manning

2371.25 --> 2377.85
Jesus Christ again with the Old

2373.29 --> 2380.19
Testament a a John Watson did you miss

2377.85 --> 2383.49
interpret Christianity because it's very

2380.19 --> 2389.93
convenient to you that your straw

2383.49 --> 2397.5
Manning it or are you just as

2389.93 --> 2401.66
anti-christian as you are baller were

2397.5 --> 2401.66
you bother by the way I'm not sure

2418.29 --> 2427.02
that you strawman me John Watson you

2422.31 --> 2430.0499999999997
strawman Jesus Christ you said that

2427.02 --> 2433.89
Christianity makes people live in mud

2430.05 --> 2438.1200000000003
huts and burning women okay John Watson

2433.89 --> 2441.18
so tell me where in God's law it it

2438.12 --> 2443.91
tells in the commandments you know yeah

2441.18 --> 2446.37
you know just because people did that in

2443.91 --> 2449.22
the past doesn't mean that that is

2446.37 --> 2452.46
exactly what people need to do your your

2449.22 --> 2456.0299999999997
very idea that all everything in the

2452.46 --> 2458.2200000000003
book is like yet you have to reenact

2456.03 --> 2461.7000000000003
everything that was done in the book

2458.22 --> 2465.45
what kind of a [ __ ] are you that you

2461.7 --> 2470.6699999999996
would think that only dumbasses think

2465.45 --> 2476.1499999999996
that you know you're supposed to learn

2470.67 --> 2476.15
from it not reenact it idiot

2495.43 --> 2501.52
oh hey John Watson how about remember

2499.51 --> 2503.9500000000003
the tablet and this is all testament

2501.52 --> 2507.579
okay this is all testament John Watson

2503.95 --> 2512.109
so let me just try to help you interpret

2507.579 --> 2517.4500000000003
what happened from a from a more

2512.109 --> 2520.299
outsider perspective okay so yeah this

2517.45 --> 2525.49
person gets a huge vision

2520.299 --> 2531.46
it receives contact from super higher

2525.49 --> 2534.5789999999997
dimensional being right that is presumed

2531.46 --> 2538.2400000000002
to be the creator because yeah it just

2534.579 --> 2542.17
feels that way and you feel things

2538.24 --> 2544.8999999999996
inside that you just never realize you

2542.17 --> 2548.23
even had okay so you get contact then

2544.9 --> 2553.839
you'll figure get some real a as to this

2548.23 --> 2557.02
is the essence this if you follow this

2553.839 --> 2560.17
essence this is in which is in the

2557.02 --> 2563.47
blueprint of creation then you walk with

2560.17 --> 2566.77
that essence so how do you relay that

2563.47 --> 2568.72
well you make basic dictated laws like

2566.77 --> 2570.099
yeah you can't do this again to that you

2568.72 --> 2573.16
can't do that and you can't do that

2570.099 --> 2576.1600000000003
because people that haven't been

2573.16 --> 2580.359
directly touched by that our basic [ __ ]

2576.16 --> 2583.5989999999997
they're just baseline people typically

2580.359 --> 2585.7599999999998
desperate don't really care too much

2583.599 --> 2586.9900000000002
about things because they feel their

2585.76 --> 2590.13
life sucks right

2586.99 --> 2593.7299999999996
so yeah the way to then translate that

2590.13 --> 2597.309
majestic essence is by laying down laws

2593.73 --> 2601.059
right does that make a little bit more

2597.309 --> 2608.1090000000004
sense but it is still the essence now

2601.059 --> 2610.599
Jesus kind of improved upon that whether

2608.109 --> 2613.48
you believe in a contract chains by a

2610.599 --> 2618.4500000000003
creator or not no he just refined it and

2613.48 --> 2621.549
he exemplified it he did it better

2618.45 --> 2628.37
better Jesus didn't kill anyone

2621.549 --> 2636.48
okay no not no revenge so he kind of

2628.37 --> 2640.71
the loss right the old loss but he kind

2636.48 --> 2643.56
of improved upon them by getting the

2640.71 --> 2647.9
more esoteric essence of it better

2643.56 --> 2651.36
forward because the basic essence

2647.9 --> 2656.58
translated into base loss were already

2651.36 --> 2659.13
kind of entangled in the people so he

2656.58 --> 2661.0499999999997
just filled in the gaps for the

2659.13 --> 2662.9100000000003
framework that was already there because

2661.05 --> 2667.4
of the Old Testament laws do you

2662.91 --> 2672.24
understand its esoterics its ethereal

2667.4 --> 2677.1
it's the essence of the Creator that's

2672.24 --> 2682.1299999999997
what it is about and if you don't get

2677.1 --> 2682.13
that then I'm very sad for you

2699.89 --> 2702.549
yeah

2704.01 --> 2715.94
no John Watson you're a dumb [ __ ] yeah

2709.73 --> 2715.94
thank you man do you I was gonna do that

2720.77 --> 2724.88
[Music]

2722.42 --> 2727.65
yeah

2724.88 --> 2732.33
mind you that in the in depth and

2727.65 --> 2738.06
explanation I have not not at home

2732.33 --> 2740.1
single time you know when I'm getting

2738.06 --> 2743.52
serious and especially when I get a

2740.1 --> 2746.46
theory I don't do that guess why because

2743.52 --> 2749.33
I'm trying to translate the essence and

2746.46 --> 2751.65
if I then start attacking people or

2749.33 --> 2753.2999999999997
emphasizing negative things it's just

2751.65 --> 2755.19
kind of ruin the essence it's got to

2753.3 --> 2757.1400000000003
spoil the essence so I don't do that

2755.19 --> 2761.76
because I'm actually making an argument

2757.14 --> 2765.06
here for real and when people have real

2761.76 --> 2770.4900000000002
arguments at humming is it's just gonna

2765.06 --> 2773.43
poison the essence of the output and it

2770.49 --> 2777.1499999999996
tells you something about people that do

2773.43 --> 2779.19
that people that add hum usually don't

2777.15 --> 2782.04
have arguments because if they did then

2779.19 --> 2785.79
that argument would triumph over the

2782.04 --> 2787.8
need to add hum because it would be felt

2785.79 --> 2792.5299999999997
as more important more important to

2787.8 --> 2792.53
uphold that so it is very telling

2798.93 --> 2815.189
okay plain truth fine no John Watson

2819.41 --> 2822.759
don't do that buddy

2825.839 --> 2830.969
if you're not willing to listen then you

2828.539 --> 2833.849
need to step away you know don't make me

2830.969 --> 2836.16
ban you buddy you need to step away

2833.849 --> 2839.549
because you're engaging in gamma rage

2836.16 --> 2844.3999999999996
right now if you can't handle the

2839.549 --> 2848.779
essence of it all and creation and

2844.4 --> 2851.489
etheric and the revelation of what

2848.779 --> 2854.16
atheism has masked us what the double

2851.489 --> 2856.199
world's think world the reversed world

2854.16 --> 2858.359
has masked for us if you can't handle

2856.199 --> 2862.549
that and you go gamma on us then you got

2858.359 --> 2867.8289999999997
a problem because it is an essential

2862.549 --> 2867.829
intricate part right next to Flat Earth

2869.029 --> 2875.309
it's actually probably even more

2872.16 --> 2877.2889999999998
important because the Flat Earth is just

2875.309 --> 2880.799
the more in-your-face

2877.289 --> 2884.8190000000004
aspect of the double think reversed

2880.799 --> 2887.939
world but why it even exists is to

2884.819 --> 2891.469
oppose the inside of creation that is

2887.939 --> 2894.299
the original purpose or it was even

2891.469 --> 2900.0190000000002
created why the spirit of Lucifer

2894.299 --> 2900.019
invented it through men

2905.319 --> 2914.5589999999997
and then man maybe seduce and get

2911.049 --> 2917.109
trapped in your first world and then and

2914.559 --> 2919.809
then hurry man we'll have a go at them

2917.109 --> 2921.819
and make them bitter because suddenly

2919.809 --> 2925.5690000000004
they don't have any purpose anymore they

2921.819 --> 2927.759
have to mud muddy or mud around and they

2925.569 --> 2929.89
don't get proper warnings for punishment

2927.759 --> 2931.539
when they afraid logos because that

2929.89 --> 2934.569
still works whether they believe it or

2931.539 --> 2936.6400000000003
not and so they will get more bitter and

2934.569 --> 2939.699
get more error Mannion and then they

2936.64 --> 2941.0789999999997
become totally yeah if they slip further

2939.699 --> 2943.569
and farther if they don't stop

2941.079 --> 2946.989
themselves they will become absolute

2943.569 --> 2949.0589999999997
gammas absolute gammas and just spend

2946.989 --> 2953.079
all that time trying to make every other

2949.059 --> 2955.6600000000003
person miserable or more miserable than

2953.079 --> 2961.9590000000003
they feel so they can feel like they are

2955.66 --> 2964.44
better and that's the worst so just

2961.959 --> 2964.44
don't do it

2972.64 --> 2983.41
that's disgusting dude I don't think

2979.6 --> 2993.48
that's the real guy by the way is icon

2983.41 --> 2993.48
is different yeah I'm sure that's a sock

3001.24 --> 3008.7099999999996
yeah there say yeah there's a sock

3003.92 --> 3008.71
that's a shape changer knowing about

3010.42 --> 3013.559
[Music]

3017.74 --> 3022.2999999999997
Alan McDonald that's ridiculous

3026.47 --> 3030.6699999999996
that's what Freemasons say

3056.66 --> 3064.1299999999997
through my research yeah I did yeah you

3060.47 --> 3067.43
know that research that research Alan

3064.13 --> 3070.4300000000003
McDonald guess what that research did

3067.43 --> 3073.79
because I did that research as a lay

3070.43 --> 3079.0699999999997
teen and young 20s guess where that got

3073.79 --> 3083.06
me buddy yeah exactly in the [ __ ] that I

3079.07 --> 3086.15
ended up in because it's Luciferian yeah

3083.06 --> 3089.12
if you're gonna claim that the boy who

3086.15 --> 3092.63
the goal is loose free oh oh God oh

3089.12 --> 3094.49
we're mistaken step away from the Bible

3092.63 --> 3096.29
so yeah if you're gonna go with that

3094.49 --> 3099.83
route then either you're gonna be

3096.29 --> 3103.07
literally as Luciferian as you can be by

3099.83 --> 3106.91
claiming Lucifer is God or you're gonna

3103.07 --> 3112.03
abandon the Bible basically making you I

3106.91 --> 3114.1099999999997
Romanian so that's the worst

3112.03 --> 3120.34
interpretation anyone could ever have

3114.11 --> 3123.86
and it's a lie you can't prove that

3120.34 --> 3128.59
it's an ethereal interpretation without

3123.86 --> 3132.11
any actual viable references

3128.59 --> 3134.51
historically it's nonsense it doesn't

3132.11 --> 3136.81
work the essence is misinterpreted it's

3134.51 --> 3136.8100000000004
wrong

3150.4 --> 3155.08
all right and by the way just to clear

3153.25 --> 3156.76
things up again because it can be a

3155.08 --> 3161.62
little bit confusing when I talk a

3156.76 --> 3163.8700000000003
cereal when I talk esoterics now not

3161.62 --> 3166.66
necessarily esoterics because esoterics

3163.87 --> 3169.42
is within symbols and interpretation and

3166.66 --> 3173.23
names in books and hieroglyphs all that

3169.42 --> 3176.82
when I talk a theory 'el as in the

3173.23 --> 3180.48
spirit and the essence of things

3176.82 --> 3185.25
potentially in the dark world view of it

3180.48 --> 3185.25
then Lucifer is something very different

3185.88 --> 3196.2400000000002
sort of it is a non it's spirits that

3193.0 --> 3200.92
are yeah that are with us and we can be

3196.24 --> 3204.8199999999997
seduced by ideas they are like part they

3200.92 --> 3207.25
do yeah they're part of us though how we

3204.82 --> 3209.8300000000004
function and they are the traps for us

3207.25 --> 3213.34
to avoid the essence they are the

3209.83 --> 3216.52
challenge and it is Lucifer and it is

3213.34 --> 3224.6200000000003
our Iman and they are the two sides you

3216.52 --> 3226.63
can go to evade that central path and

3224.62 --> 3229.0
that is esoteric so when I say Lucifer

3226.63 --> 3232.62
in that it is not the lid it's not a

3229.0 --> 3235.66
literal reference to the fallen angel

3232.62 --> 3239.29
which is presumed to be a literal being

3235.66 --> 3244.0299999999997
at some point in ancient history not

3239.29 --> 3247.7799999999997
that although it may be tied in maybe

3244.03 --> 3253.09
that is what ended up of him I'd not

3247.78 --> 3256.21
sure yeah I did say they have all been

3253.09 --> 3259.42
chained down in the in the underworld by

3256.21 --> 3262.51
God so they're not here are they when is

3259.42 --> 3265.03
what what is when ah I don't know but

3262.51 --> 3268.7200000000003
these things are seem to be just a part

3265.03 --> 3271.03
of our natural functioning they seem to

3268.72 --> 3274.2099999999996
be the traps within us and the outside

3271.03 --> 3277.09
world can amplify that a lot trigger

3274.21 --> 3278.8
that and it is being done because the

3277.09 --> 3282.67
entire society is just based on trying

3278.8 --> 3287.059
to seduce everyone to become

3282.67 --> 3289.13
extremely predictable and the easiest

3287.059 --> 3291.4100000000003
way to make pretty people predicting

3289.13 --> 3295.819
them is by letting them get possessed by

3291.41 --> 3298.999
Ahriman lucifer is not so much

3295.819 --> 3301.279
predictable but in yeah you tend the

3298.999 --> 3308.1499999999996
seduction by Lucifer always leads to

3301.279 --> 3311.779
higher Iman always I can take a lot of

3308.15 --> 3313.309
time but if you deepen if you deepen the

3311.779 --> 3316.099
drink from the cup of Lucifer

3313.309 --> 3319.099
metaphorically then you always end up

3316.099 --> 3321.65
with Ireland but yeah you can drink from

3319.099 --> 3325.13
it and then figure out wait this is kind

3321.65 --> 3328.5190000000002
of poison I have to stop now and then

3325.13 --> 3332.2090000000003
you can attempt to step away back on the

3328.519 --> 3335.1189999999997
path to Christ but if you keep on

3332.209 --> 3339.44
drinking you will end up with a demon

3335.119 --> 3343.4590000000003
always doesn't mean you're gonna die but

3339.44 --> 3345.819
you're the Lucifer essence will be

3343.459 --> 3348.259
replaced by ironmen essence it's

3345.819 --> 3352.13
unavoidable Lucifer can never last

3348.259 --> 3358.16
forever that's also an interesting part

3352.13 --> 3361.359
of the esoteric insights on Lucifer the

3358.16 --> 3365.449
fallen angel right isn't it fascinating

3361.359 --> 3368.9
esoterics a theory illness the rudolf

3365.449 --> 3373.039
steiner teaching and the bible literal

3368.9 --> 3375.589
interpretation it's all fits it all fits

3373.039 --> 3378.349
i said it from the start every angle you

3375.589 --> 3380.69
approach the bible with every angle it

3378.349 --> 3383.6600000000003
can work and it can all work together

3380.69 --> 3385.849
even though it's seemingly contrasting

3383.66 --> 3388.43
the contrast is only seemingly from a

3385.849 --> 3391.839
superficial perspective when you reach

3388.43 --> 3394.5789999999997
into the essences of it and it all fits

3391.839 --> 3396.609
it's not as contradicting as you would

3394.579 --> 3396.6090000000004
think

3403.23 --> 3418.95
yeah yeah turned out to be a very

3408.06 --> 3421.4
biblical Sunday show yeah thanks secret

3418.95 --> 3421.3999999999996
Asian man

3446.78 --> 3454.07
yeah baits 60 RMC you know what you're

3452.0 --> 3456.86
right worshipping Shaitan Satan while

3454.07 --> 3459.92
Satan is literally the even means the

3456.86 --> 3461.78
opposer whether you take it as a literal

3459.92 --> 3464.78
being or a spirit or an essence or

3461.78 --> 3467.8100000000004
whatever so it is literally breaking the

3464.78 --> 3469.28
law don't worship anyone before me but

3467.81 --> 3475.16
even the worship you know it is

3469.28 --> 3477.8900000000003
difficult and with it I kind of respect

3475.16 --> 3482.29
oh here I go again I kind of respect

3477.89 --> 3484.8799999999997
Muslims because they don't allow icons

3482.29 --> 3487.22
officially that's kind of how it started

3484.88 --> 3489.9500000000003
out that's why they don't even allow

3487.22 --> 3495.2
depictions in their temples or whatever

3489.95 --> 3499.85
you're gonna call it and I respect that

3495.2 --> 3502.97
because is that thing you're going to

3499.85 --> 3505.7
worship is it a proper are you in

3502.97 --> 3508.3999999999996
leashing your thoughts upon and the

3505.7 --> 3511.0699999999997
interpretation upon that icon properly

3508.4 --> 3511.67
are you truly getting the essence of the

3511.07 --> 3515.8900000000003
creator

3511.67 --> 3519.26
or are you allowing the visual to

3515.89 --> 3522.17
earthen down the actual conception of

3519.26 --> 3532.9300000000003
the unlimited magnificence of the

3522.17 --> 3535.04
creation see so I don't worship gods or

3532.93 --> 3539.06
conceptualizations even of the Creator

3535.04 --> 3543.08
no I prefer to worship the very essence

3539.06 --> 3547.16
itself the essence when I recognize it

3543.08 --> 3553.64
when I feel it and I seek it out that is

3547.16 --> 3556.1299999999997
kind of I prefer to worship that and all

3553.64 --> 3558.3799999999997
things that contain it in a way but I

3556.13 --> 3560.75
don't worship those things I worship the

3558.38 --> 3563.2400000000002
essence I don't worship anything matter

3560.75 --> 3565.34
or nothing personified no the essence I

3563.24 --> 3568.85
I basically you could call me an

3565.34 --> 3572.78
esoteric or an ethereal worship or a tit

3568.85 --> 3576.71
worship the essence and I do think that

3572.78 --> 3579.5600000000004
I am properly worshiping the God as

3576.71 --> 3580.64
originally intended because even that

3579.56 --> 3583.42
was an

3580.64 --> 3599.45
again relating it to the basic people

3583.42 --> 3605.84
see so this is how I do it no Alan

3599.45 --> 3611.21
McDonald multitude or individual does

3605.84 --> 3614.81
not it is already personification it is

3611.21 --> 3619.16
all the essence it is all Alpha and the

3614.81 --> 3622.61
Omega you can't say singular multiple

3619.16 --> 3631.0099999999998
know it creator is just again a problem

3622.61 --> 3633.83
with word words and then there is the

3631.01 --> 3635.42
technical argument which has some valid

3633.83 --> 3637.75
point and that is how did it all start

3635.42 --> 3641.84
well with a singular thing

3637.75 --> 3645.11
so that is why creator is definitely

3641.84 --> 3647.84
preferred why singular should be

3645.11 --> 3653.33
emphasized if a technical choice had to

3647.84 --> 3656.2000000000003
be made but I don't think that it yeah

3653.33 --> 3659.7799999999997
it is all it is the Alpha and the Omega

3656.2 --> 3664.52
singular multiple but those are concepts

3659.78 --> 3667.7900000000004
that already split up in the yeah

3664.52 --> 3670.63
because of material approach you see no

3667.79 --> 3670.63
it is all

3682.779 --> 3685.559
hmm

3704.43 --> 3707.73
all right

3713.24 --> 3726.56
well Mazhar salim know that that has no

3721.37 --> 3728.7799999999997
there is there is an East there is an

3726.56 --> 3730.88
East it doesn't even matter what model

3728.78 --> 3734.53
you're gonna take there is an East it's

3730.88 --> 3739.19
very simple it is extrapolated from

3734.53 --> 3743.03
where the globe of the heaven rotation

3739.19 --> 3745.67
is oriented that's it that's the e so

3743.03 --> 3747.38
there is always a nice it doesn't matter

3745.67 --> 3751.4300000000003
what you're going to conceptualize the

3747.38 --> 3754.34
earth as as for that thing does it

3751.43 --> 3757.96
really matter that much I think that the

3754.34 --> 3761.3900000000003
prayer to the east is basically a

3757.96 --> 3766.7
uniformity thing that is introduced it

3761.39 --> 3770.27
is a it is an exoteric element of islam

3766.7 --> 3773.54
okay it is not is it really essential it

3770.27 --> 3779.03
seems just ritualistic it's more about

3773.54 --> 3781.2799999999997
uniformity and who knows there may be an

3779.03 --> 3785.6000000000004
asset or an ethereal element to it

3781.28 --> 3789.4100000000003
because the East is there a special kind

3785.6 --> 3792.5
of yet Sun energy or what there could be

3789.41 --> 3797.12
something there that really makes it

3792.5 --> 3799.49
important in a way probably then

3797.12 --> 3801.68
relating to the celestial bodies since

3799.49 --> 3805.3999999999996
that is how is this even determine

3801.68 --> 3807.89
properly okay so there could be

3805.4 --> 3810.25
something there but overall I think that

3807.89 --> 3812.72
praying to the east is an exoteric

3810.25 --> 3818.96
element and it's not that important

3812.72 --> 3822.0499999999997
oh oh oh sorry sorry you feel that way

3818.96 --> 3828.02
you don't even know how many Muslims do

3822.05 --> 3831.26
you know tell me how Muslims are duped

3828.02 --> 3834.1
compared to Christians when you're

3831.26 --> 3837.1000000000004
talking to the average person among that

3834.1 --> 3837.1
so

3844.34 --> 3851.33
[Music]

3847.36 --> 3857.81
hey eight account you can do whatever

3851.33 --> 3860.39
you like man and I don't care I again

3857.81 --> 3864.44
the what is the problem with the abroad

3860.39 --> 3867.23
Abrahamic religions okay what is the

3864.44 --> 3872.3
problem well that there is cultural fill

3867.23 --> 3875.63
in that is a bit of a problem yeah don't

3872.3 --> 3877.82
do that a gem don't slander if you're

3875.63 --> 3878.36
gonna get anti-muslim on me you're

3877.82 --> 3881.75
banned

3878.36 --> 3884.69
okay if you're gonna go for that

3881.75 --> 3887.53
aromanian trigger implant it now

3884.69 --> 3890.63
actively propagandized and implant it

3887.53 --> 3892.9100000000003
because it is overlooked again that a

3890.63 --> 3895.76
lot of nasty [ __ ] is happening because

3892.91 --> 3898.0099999999998
of Pharisees why do these Pharisees do

3895.76 --> 3903.5
that because they get funding by the big

3898.01 --> 3909.38
beasts and push they get promoted the

3903.5 --> 3913.66
Pharisees not Muslims don't do that

3909.38 --> 3913.6600000000003
again a gem I'm serious

3922.61 --> 3928.82
right so rejecting the Abraham religions

3925.85 --> 3931.46
that's fine I understand about Abraham

3928.82 --> 3932.42
religions I don't give a [ __ ] about

3931.46 --> 3938.45
racism

3932.42 --> 3940.88
hm I don't give a [ __ ] don't slander the

3938.45 --> 3945.62
other religions when you clearly don't

3940.88 --> 3948.98
understand them you can have criticisms

3945.62 --> 3952.1
about things happening but hey people do

3948.98 --> 3954.32
that with Christianity - oh you don't

3952.1 --> 3957.3199999999997
like them well why don't you stop

3954.32 --> 3972.71
behaving like that towards other people

3957.32 --> 3975.8
ajm stop being a basic [ __ ] yeah that's

3972.71 --> 3977.9
right you don't understand it just like

3975.8 --> 3981.04
other people don't understand

3977.9 --> 3991.28
Christianity and say [ __ ] about that

3981.04 --> 3993.23
alright don't do it now that's fine am i

3991.28 --> 3997.4900000000002
ok if you can't handle it look I'm sick

3993.23 --> 4002.5
of this don't do it just don't go there

3997.49 --> 4007.1499999999996
don't go there you're ruining my essence

4002.5 --> 4011.85
with your aromanian [ __ ] ok don't poison

4007.15 --> 4017.9500000000003
my well or you're out so let's get back

4011.85 --> 4023.52
to a more interesting question or rather

4017.95 --> 4023.52
a statement from count says he rejects

4024.03 --> 4029.59
he rejects our hammock religions well

4027.04 --> 4030.84
the issue the thing is you can do that

4029.59 --> 4033.55
in a way I

4030.84 --> 4036.13
well it might Luciferian attempt because

4033.55 --> 4039.7000000000003
that is kind of what happens I did that

4036.13 --> 4041.9500000000003
when I was younger as well but the there

4039.7 --> 4043.8399999999997
is a yeah because of the cultural

4041.95 --> 4046.21
influence is that it because it is

4043.84 --> 4048.67
written by man but then you start to

4046.21 --> 4050.86
overlook other things about it and you

4048.67 --> 4053.62
start to polarize yourself against it

4050.86 --> 4055.869
and then you got a problem because the

4053.62 --> 4058.749
essence is contained with it

4055.869 --> 4061.059
the true logos doesn't matter if you

4058.749 --> 4063.279
believe everything literal as it is

4061.059 --> 4065.92
there it is there and if you're gonna

4063.279 --> 4067.809
say I don't believe those IRA hammock

4065.92 --> 4070.599
religions that I'm pretty certain that

4067.809 --> 4074.079
you're not gonna read not really gonna

4070.599 --> 4075.67
think about it or dig deeper allow

4074.079 --> 4079.63
yourself to really be touched by the

4075.67 --> 4081.67
deeper essences and that doesn't mean

4079.63 --> 4084.339
that you can't figure out logos by

4081.67 --> 4091.66
yourself but it yeah it doesn't make it

4084.339 --> 4094.66
easier if you're gonna reject a good a

4091.66 --> 4097.289
very critical blueprint that contains

4094.66 --> 4097.289
the essence

4116.34 --> 4121.06
[Music]

4121.97 --> 4128.400000000001
yeah good servant yeah that's right God

4125.01 --> 4130.83
inspired the essence approached these

4128.4 --> 4131.509999999999
individuals and they tried to translate

4130.83 --> 4137.5199999999995
it

4131.51 --> 4140.64
some prefabricated by the by the you had

4137.52 --> 4144.3
the God consciousness has to be relayed

4140.64 --> 4147.47
in some way but it is the Alpha and the

4144.3 --> 4154.2
Omega how can you it's very difficult to

4147.47 --> 4157.2
dumb down two levels of humans if you're

4154.2 --> 4158.37
the Almighty Creator I can imagine so it

4157.2 --> 4160.53
is always going to be the human

4158.37 --> 4170.36
interpretation factor but the essence is

4160.53 --> 4177.78
still there no I don't Martin Allen I

4170.36 --> 4180.049999999999
don't care about that guy at all it's so

4177.78 --> 4180.05
dumb

4180.68 --> 4187.55
I'm not gonna poison this conversation

4183.99 --> 4187.55
by bringing up thanks very much

4194.11 --> 4202.579
yeah Alan McDonald that's extremely

4197.3 --> 4205.639
ignorant that is extremely ignorant they

4202.579 --> 4208.34
said the essence is there and what

4205.639 --> 4211.7300000000005
Romans and evil rulers and the Vatican

4208.34 --> 4213.409000000001
did with that well they they wield it

4211.73 --> 4215.959999999999
they try to wheel the essence like

4213.409 --> 4218.989
Lucifer give it their own spin with our

4215.96 --> 4220.699
Romanian results on the side naturally

4218.989 --> 4223.04
because they are trying to control it

4220.699 --> 4224.629999999999
but the essence is there they didn't

4223.04 --> 4228.619
want to change that they couldn't they

4224.63 --> 4231.650000000001
couldn't get it out so they tried to

4228.619 --> 4234.619
contain it because the essence is real

4231.65 --> 4237.28
it's just what they do with it that's

4234.619 --> 4237.28
poison

4252.73 --> 4255.91

4257.8 --> 4271.3
don't you dare tell me that I'm

4261.2 --> 4271.3
closed-minded get out of here that's

4272.88 --> 4277.400000000001
that's just repulsive dude

4282.099 --> 4289.03
that's man I shouldn't have banned him

4284.98 --> 4291.28
that that is just that is one of the

4289.03 --> 4294.429
most sivanna things I've ever seen

4291.28 --> 4299.17
somebody write in my chat I'm gonna post

4294.429 --> 4303.909
it just to show you again what what

4299.17 --> 4307.719
people can get themselves to say come on

4303.909 --> 4309.098999999999
Arwen I would Jin don't close your mind

4307.719 --> 4312.159
leave it open

4309.099 --> 4317.53
evil rules and controls the world today

4312.159 --> 4323.199
and all history as we know it yeah so

4317.53 --> 4326.86
what is the purpose because you're not

4323.199 --> 4330.669999999999
you're just your take your that's an

4326.86 --> 4332.53
error Mannion big that's an everyman you

4330.67 --> 4337.4800000000005
dig it basically the essence of what

4332.53 --> 4339.389
you're saying is it doesn't matter it

4337.48 --> 4343.449
doesn't matter anymore

4339.389 --> 4347.8
really is that is that the revelation of

4343.449 --> 4353.079
the truth or is it giving up and being a

4347.8 --> 4358.77
gamma little [ __ ] and just emphasizing

4353.079 --> 4358.7699999999995
the darkness it's disgusting

4377.03 --> 4381.7699999999995
all right Islam okay well maybe I

4379.91 --> 4384.59
shouldn't have used the word Islam it's

4381.77 --> 4386.780000000001
difficult I don't regularly talk about

4384.59 --> 4390.76
those things a gem but I meant Muslims

4386.78 --> 4394.73
people just that just follow the Quran

4390.76 --> 4399.47
try to be good people that's what I

4394.73 --> 4402.08
meant and yeah the political Islam it is

4399.47 --> 4406.34
Pharisee and it's absolutely Pharisee

4402.08 --> 4412.39
and all that so yeah they have poisoned

4406.34 --> 4416.4800000000005
it their controllers have poisoned that

4412.39 --> 4419.3
just like the Vatican came into being

4416.48 --> 4421.37
pretty much all moved on to there could

4419.3 --> 4425.95
have been a Vatican even before that

4421.37 --> 4430.12
sort of but it moved and it consumed

4425.95 --> 4433.48
Christianity made yeah took that and

4430.12 --> 4437.0599999999995
captured it and pretended to be that

4433.48 --> 4440.209999999999
well the same definitely happened with

4437.06 --> 4442.46
with Mohammed and what he did and then a

4440.21 --> 4446.87
bunch of warlords start to abuse that

4442.46 --> 4450.53
[ __ ] okay that's what happened it's very

4446.87 --> 4453.98
similar story it tends to happen when

4450.53 --> 4457.219999999999
God touches down upon the world for some

4453.98 --> 4460.61
reason when he when he starts to lay

4457.22 --> 4464.75
down a message yeah the Pharisees come

4460.61 --> 4467.44
and they try to wreck that [ __ ] that's

4464.75 --> 4467.44
what happens

4471.17 --> 4487.92
well there you go a gem glad you could

4475.26 --> 4495.5
say it Muhammad was the warlord right

4487.92 --> 4500.039
well what was he though was he at first

4495.5 --> 4502.71
could be not sure that I did yeah I

4500.039 --> 4504.809
should definitely read more up on the

4502.71 --> 4510.38
story I haven't to be fair it only

4504.809 --> 4516.719
preliminaries but I don't have a Quran

4510.38 --> 4519.4800000000005
I've talked about it but yeah pretty

4516.719 --> 4528.11
sure that a lot of people like that

4519.48 --> 4533.94
entire region was at war and hey I

4528.11 --> 4536.509999999999
didn't at first remember the early this

4533.94 --> 4539.61
is kind of historical as well the early

4536.51 --> 4542.4490000000005
Islam right after Muhammad yeah there

4539.61 --> 4547.549999999999
was war and then they had an amazing

4542.449 --> 4550.259999999999
Renaissance time of peace and design and

4547.55 --> 4555.96
well supposed to a lot of mathematics

4550.26 --> 4558.51
because they avoided imagery so they did

4555.96 --> 4560.88
actually bring great peace and they also

4558.51 --> 4563.039000000001
were very tolerant and then the

4560.88 --> 4566.1900000000005
Pharisees game and just turned it into

4563.039 --> 4567.179999999999
an empire [ __ ] starts that slaughtered

4566.19 --> 4572.489
everyone

4567.18 --> 4572.4890000000005
[Music]

4583.92 --> 4586.92
please

4595.08 --> 4603.48
Latin is a is a created language the

4599.88 --> 4608.61
original Bible wasn't even in Latin the

4603.48 --> 4612.629999999999
original text Latin was a created

4608.61 --> 4618.0599999999995
language that was used also to keep the

4612.63 --> 4620.9400000000005
in it was a secret language for yeah

4618.06 --> 4622.04
that's how they kept the Bible to

4620.94 --> 4624.839999999999
themselves

4622.04 --> 4626.58
it's occulta fiying they kept it away

4624.84 --> 4629.400000000001
from the people they kept it to the

4626.58 --> 4631.5599999999995
priesthood and the priesthood could read

4629.4 --> 4632.94
it and it yeah other people were not

4631.56 --> 4640.71
supposed to read it they would even

4632.94 --> 4644.0599999999995
punish them yeah because that is what

4640.71 --> 4650.58
that is what the Vatican did remember

4644.06 --> 4653.070000000001
they took it encapsulated it because

4650.58 --> 4655.59
that is what Lucifer does tries to take

4653.07 --> 4658.53
that light tries to bear it but as he's

4655.59 --> 4661.2
bearing it yeah nasty [ __ ] comes from it

4658.53 --> 4664.07
so he is carrying he's wielding that the

4661.2 --> 4668.12
that pure light but he's basically

4664.07 --> 4668.12
obstructing the shine of it

4675.48 --> 4680.249
[Music]

4681.969 --> 4690.19
no no baby phantom not at all and I'm

4687.28 --> 4693.429999999999
not even too sure about her Roman

4690.19 --> 4695.489
history for a big part I don't think all

4693.43 --> 4698.9800000000005
of it is real I think it is a lot of

4695.489 --> 4701.23
creation a lot of desert yeah design

4698.98 --> 4704.349999999999
history although there were probably a

4701.23 --> 4714.209999999999
group called the Romans and they had a

4704.35 --> 4717.34
major influence no feel that James Latin

4714.21 --> 4719.949
afterward remember the Bibles were

4717.34 --> 4724.53
written that I'm talking supposed

4719.949 --> 4728.46
medieval times after the Romans it was

4724.53 --> 4728.46
it was not the spoken language

4733.93 --> 4739.52
but I don't think that the Romans were

4736.37 --> 4745.97
what what you think they are but they

4739.52 --> 4752.660000000001
did have massive influence whatever they

4745.97 --> 4756.26
were and they have indeed design they

4752.66 --> 4759.2
have basically been societal

4756.26 --> 4763.01
re-engineers in my opinion they created

4759.2 --> 4770.389999999999
new languages and they subjugated

4763.01 --> 4774.110000000001
people's and force them to change but

4770.39 --> 4777.910000000001
this idea of this huge Roman Empire like

4774.11 --> 4777.91
that I don't think it was like that

4782.17 --> 4788.47
now Winston Smith no I have good reason

4785.44 --> 4791.0199999999995
to believe that that's not all as it

4788.47 --> 4793.6
seems not saying there was absolutely

4791.02 --> 4796.870000000001
nothing going on and there were

4793.6 --> 4799.09
definitely things built but I'm just

4796.87 --> 4801.69
saying I think that it was it's it's

4799.09 --> 4806.4400000000005
probably most of it has been

4801.69 --> 4809.799999999999
historically engineered to cover for

4806.44 --> 4812.2
other things that they completely want

4809.8 --> 4819.58
out it's a cover story to cover up more

4812.2 --> 4821.679999999999
ancient stuff now I don't I do I have

4819.58 --> 4824.62
absolute good reasons to think that I

4821.68 --> 4827.16
have been thinking that for a while and

4824.62 --> 4829.96
it kind of came out of the the mud flood

4827.16 --> 4831.91
situation which I don't absolutely

4829.96 --> 4834.67
believe what typical people that deal

4831.91 --> 4836.92
with that go out and leave my own

4834.67 --> 4839.29
figuring out but I'm pretty sure that

4836.92 --> 4841.66
yeah as Martin Allen says the Roman

4839.29 --> 4847.2
historical record is a bit dodgy indeed

4841.66 --> 4847.2
it is because things are left out

4853.13 --> 4862.7300000000005
now on the other hand the Byzantine

4855.989 --> 4869.16
Empire I'm pretty sure that was real but

4862.73 --> 4871.83
apparently it just transited the Roman

4869.16 --> 4875.219
Empire fell and then it just be it it

4871.83 --> 4876.84
just became the Byzantine M really it

4875.219 --> 4881.4890000000005
just became the Byzantine am it just

4876.84 --> 4886.92
happened how does that work how can that

4881.489 --> 4889.129999999999
all just transit not sure how that can

4886.92 --> 4889.13
work

4893.42 --> 4897.01
[Music]

4900.29 --> 4911.489
yeah Winston Smith get out if you can't

4909.36 --> 4913.219
handle what I talk about you gotta get

4911.489 --> 4916.5
out of here

4913.219 --> 4919.25
you're not gonna say that kind of [ __ ]

4916.5 --> 4919.25
here in my chat

4924.93 --> 4930.54
and if you can't handle that history is

4928.23 --> 4933.33
written by the winner and it is designed

4930.54 --> 4935.91
to influence us and to keep us away from

4933.33 --> 4941.33
what actually transpired a lot of the

4935.91 --> 4941.33
times then you have no place being here

4941.42 --> 4952.29
there is historical conspiracy it's it's

4945.66 --> 4954.72
freaking admitted in details but it's

4952.29 --> 4957.89
constantly admitted that things didn't

4954.72 --> 4960.45
actually turn out to be what was said

4957.89 --> 4962.55
constantly and it's not even like Oh an

4960.45 --> 4965.24
excavation they sorta know it's just

4962.55 --> 4968.12
like openly admitted in recent history

4965.24 --> 4973.32
not too far it's just like yeah that was

4968.12 --> 4977.55
total [ __ ] yeah so why do you think

4973.32 --> 4980.73
that the the ancient history why would

4977.55 --> 4984.900000000001
you presume that it's all now well

4980.73 --> 4988.379999999999
government constantly lies per default

4984.9 --> 4990.8099999999995
about not-too-distant history what makes

4988.38 --> 4994.79
you think that all of that is exactly as

4990.81 --> 4994.79
is are you out of your mind man

4998.73 --> 5001.879999999999
[Music]

5006.62 --> 5011.479
[Music]

5015.38 --> 5022.86
hmm yes somebody found a stash of fire

5021.06 --> 5025.25
work they overlooked during the New

5022.86 --> 5025.25
Year's Eve

5031.01 --> 5034.069
[Music]

5039.699 --> 5049.268999999999
no Martin Ellen don't be ridiculous

5043.119 --> 5052.28
no we just need recycling

5049.269 --> 5062.63
don't burn your television recycle them

5052.28 --> 5065.148999999999
and hey anyway modern TVs you know you

5062.63 --> 5067.249
did you don't have to even watch TVs on

5065.149 --> 5071.119000000001
it on them you can just use them as an

5067.249 --> 5073.749
extra monitor for you for your computer

5071.119 --> 5073.749
so

5083.209 --> 5086.629
what's going on

5109.35 --> 5117.120000000001
not really unicorn Slayer that's unusual

5114.45 --> 5124.3099999999995
for somebody to say that after all this

5117.12 --> 5128.79
am i worshipping some book or worship BS

5124.31 --> 5131.1900000000005
what am i worshipping that is BS where's

5128.79 --> 5133.65
my icon where is the rules that imma

5131.19 --> 5138.96
taking where's the exoteric rules that I

5133.65 --> 5146.03
follow so meticulously where where where

5138.96 --> 5146.03
exactly where is that unicorn Slayer or

5148.31 --> 5158.43
am I just talking about esoterics and in

5153.62 --> 5160.76
the essence of it it seems kind of

5158.43 --> 5164.9400000000005
disrespectful to say such a thing

5160.76 --> 5166.35
after all this you know after me talking

5164.94 --> 5168.5599999999995
1 and a half hours about this pretty

5166.35 --> 5168.56
much

5195.539 --> 5203.139
ha yeah Mazhar salim isn't that

5198.61 --> 5207.489
fascinating yeah who did that could it

5203.139 --> 5211.209
be the Roman Empire

5207.489 --> 5215.159
there's even movies about this ok the

5211.209 --> 5219.789
Roman Empire or rather the Roman elite

5215.159 --> 5223.36
that then kind of turned into the

5219.789 --> 5227.579
Vatican they yeah

5223.36 --> 5231.82
they changed the story they reset

5227.579 --> 5234.518999999999
history into the new setting where

5231.82 --> 5236.499
suddenly they're there what there would

5234.519 --> 5240.34
not be any Roman Empire any more know

5236.499 --> 5243.219
there would be a Vatican they would be

5240.34 --> 5246.4890000000005
more like a central thing like a central

5243.219 --> 5249.189
core thing that would be involved in

5246.489 --> 5254.978999999999
banking and all that because they were

5249.189 --> 5259.150000000001
probably doing that all the way before

5254.979 --> 5261.789000000001
that and they just kind of filled in

5259.15 --> 5264.308999999999
they probably created their Roman Empire

5261.789 --> 5267.55
as a straw man for a lot of dirty [ __ ]

5264.309 --> 5270.9890000000005
that they pulled on people they probably

5267.55 --> 5273.88
did just a lot of nasty robbery [ __ ] and

5270.989 --> 5275.619
genocide and disgusting things and then

5273.88 --> 5278.159000000001
they thought yeah you know what maybe we

5275.619 --> 5280.268999999999
should like it's been hundreds of years

5278.159 --> 5283.058999999999
people really don't like the real

5280.269 --> 5286.719
history we have maybe we should like

5283.059 --> 5288.76
invent some kind of empire that came and

5286.719 --> 5292.86
fell and did all that damage so we don't

5288.76 --> 5292.860000000001
have to take that upon our reputation

5293.369 --> 5303.308999999999
that's probably a big part of it yeah

5300.309 --> 5304.349
Karen be your trip and now it's actually

5303.309 --> 5307.92
Monday

5304.349 --> 5307.92

5337.429 --> 5349.07
bed is do I sound like I'm feeling No

5344.689 --> 5350.42
I feel excellent I think you're

5349.07 --> 5353.15
projecting on me

5350.42 --> 5356.469
HM you seem to be the one that's on the

5353.15 --> 5356.469
wrong side of the bed here

5364.1 --> 5370.67
[Music]

5366.59 --> 5376.7390000000005

5370.67 --> 5378.2390000000005
don't tell me okay every word I say

5376.739 --> 5382.29
every action I do

5378.239 --> 5384.599999999999
I am watched one way or the other and I

5382.29 --> 5388.949
live by that I have lived by that for

5384.6 --> 5394.9490000000005
years now basically given up with great

5388.949 --> 5397.86
difficulty the fantasy that I can keep

5394.949 --> 5400.969
things a secret completely only to my

5397.86 --> 5404.58
own consciousness I've given up on that

5400.969 --> 5408.8
very vigorously so don't you tell me

5404.58 --> 5408.8
God's listening age am

5429.76 --> 5435.7300000000005
no just don't have this attitude towards

5432.73 --> 5439.179999999999
me hm it really pisses me off

5435.73 --> 5443.95
it's your bible-bashing mode I hate

5439.18 --> 5445.9890000000005
people that do that if you don't get

5443.95 --> 5449.489
over it if you don't learn to get over

5445.989 --> 5458.2
that I just don't want you here

5449.489 --> 5460.839999999999
I've been plenty of clear about that so

5458.2 --> 5463.84
if you wanna be a part of this show

5460.84 --> 5467.35
sometime when you are like this you got

5463.84 --> 5469.87
to step away or you're not going to be

5467.35 --> 5480.04
here when you don't feel that so it's up

5469.87 --> 5483.099999999999
to you a gem yeah well your yeah your

5480.04 --> 5485.76
attitude I said earlier you hated

5483.1 --> 5488.05
Muslims yeah well apparently you do

5485.76 --> 5490.900000000001
because you spammed all that caps

5488.05 --> 5493.110000000001
nonsense but so evil in the Antichrist

5490.9 --> 5496.21
blah blah blah blah blah blah

5493.11 --> 5498.4
and then later yeah you give a little

5496.21 --> 5502.42
sentence like oh yeah regular Muslims

5498.4 --> 5505.739
are good that yeah but you haven't

5502.42 --> 5509.95
actually reflected upon my statements

5505.739 --> 5511.66
that I make about it like hey maybe it

5509.95 --> 5514.54
is a god really

5511.66 --> 5518.41
maybe does have logos in their own way

5514.54 --> 5520.78
some other exoteric emphasis and all

5518.41 --> 5523.21
that but maybe yeah maybe they have been

5520.78 --> 5527.17
taken over by the pharisees just like

5523.21 --> 5531.37
Christianity as Catholicism and all the

5527.17 --> 5535.9890000000005
others you know you haven't relate you

5531.37 --> 5539.37
haven't even responded to that but you

5535.989 --> 5539.37
get all complaining pants

5549.909 --> 5556.12
no instead every time everything that I

5553.63 --> 5558.4890000000005
say concerning Muslims or the history

5556.12 --> 5562.48
note you've been trying to gamma

5558.489 --> 5564.218999999999
sabotage me every step of the way like

5562.48 --> 5566.138999999999
all you said something contradicting oh

5564.219 --> 5568.389
no this is wrong oh you're you're wrong

5566.139 --> 5570.67
you're just trying to point out how I'm

5568.389 --> 5573.150000000001
wrong at every point you're not

5570.67 --> 5574.96
conveying that you're actually getting

5573.15 --> 5579.9
what I'm saying

5574.96 --> 5579.9
AGM you're rejecting me

5586.53 --> 5589.67
[Music]

5593.56 --> 5603.769
[Music]

5600.55 --> 5612.709
nobody needs you to attack other

5603.769 --> 5615.129
religions you know it's just maybe you

5612.709 --> 5619.269
shouldn't spend so much time attacking I

5615.129 --> 5619.269
think that is the problem

5623.88 --> 5627.659000000001
[Music]

5643.069 --> 5651.820000000001
good

5645.16 --> 5655.139999999999
oh you think you're funny right yeah I'm

5651.82 --> 5655.139999999999
sick of your attitude a gym

5657.95 --> 5661.0289999999995
[Music]

5663.93 --> 5670.13
[Music]

5666.23 --> 5673.95
now actually I'm done with your attitude

5670.13 --> 5676.02
I'll see if I'll unlock you because I

5673.95 --> 5678.03
don't want you to say any word more

5676.02 --> 5681.120000000001
because everything that's come out it's

5678.03 --> 5683.55
all whiny it's all gamma it's all very

5681.12 --> 5685.79
annoying and disrespectful and I'm sick

5683.55 --> 5685.79
of it

5686.03 --> 5694.11
done with your poison go attack other

5691.47 --> 5696.29
people that's what you want to do all

5694.11 --> 5696.29
day long

5711.11 --> 5719.0199999999995
ah and peace has returned to thank God

5715.87 --> 5721.5199999999995
should have done that sometime before I

5719.02 --> 5724.1
don't know you know we have a history

5721.52 --> 5726.830000000001
he's been around for a while and he

5724.1 --> 5729.5
keeps on doing this [ __ ] and he's

5726.83 --> 5731.84
everywhere and he's always freaking

5729.5 --> 5735.08
attacking everyone like what the hell is

5731.84 --> 5739.57
this guy's problem why are you always

5735.08 --> 5739.57
doing that it's super annoying

5764.23 --> 5770.5599999999995
my karora can you please stop posting

5767.09 --> 5770.56
and retracting messages

5792.219 --> 5797.32
yeah way too much friction for my

5795.05 --> 5797.320000000001
comfort

5799.989 --> 5805.718999999999
anyway yeah the hangout did start out

5802.249 --> 5805.719
pretty good I think

5811.3 --> 5814.879
[Music]

5825.17 --> 5831.09
anybody who's gonna anybody's here

5828.48 --> 5833.419999999999
whether they are suck or they're a

5831.09 --> 5838.429
genuine person if they're gonna tell me

5833.42 --> 5841.1990000000005
that I don't respond to inquiry or

5838.429 --> 5843.51
whatever well you might if you actually

5841.199 --> 5845.699
paid attention you'd heard that

5843.51 --> 5848.280000000001
everything that was said that I didn't

5845.699 --> 5851.848999999999
agree with I responded to every single

5848.28 --> 5855.42
thing every detail and I do it every

5851.849 --> 5859.7390000000005
time so if you're gonna say that [ __ ]

5855.42 --> 5862.1990000000005
banned because I do pride myself in

5859.739 --> 5867.2699999999995
doing that and sometimes get things

5862.199 --> 5869.009999999999
wrong when I do I correct him and try to

5867.27 --> 5873.059
do it as quickly as possible because I

5869.01 --> 5875.84
don't care about being humiliated on the

5873.059 --> 5879.0
spot for making a mistake I don't care I

5875.84 --> 5883.2300000000005
only care about and to do things right

5879.0 --> 5886.71
and that I stand by my principles that I

5883.23 --> 5890.009999999999
answer questions correct myself when I

5886.71 --> 5895.159
figure out I'm wrong I do that don't you

5890.01 --> 5895.159000000001
freaking put that [ __ ] in my chat

5903.83 --> 5909.8099999999995
don't we all just love all platforms now

5907.28 --> 5917.219
well I always thought oil platforms were

5909.81 --> 5920.55
pretty cool but in a way I did kind of

5917.219 --> 5925.59
build oil platforms with Legos except

5920.55 --> 5932.360000000001
wasn't yeah it was on planets in outer

5925.59 --> 5932.360000000001
space space platforms space oil digging

5945.25 --> 5947.28
ooh

5947.969 --> 5953.28
Oh care and be you mean telepathy that's

5951.06 --> 5954.06
called telepathy mind speak it's

5953.28 --> 5961.71
fascinating

5954.06 --> 5965.04
I've experienced it but then again I put

5961.71 --> 5967.56
my head open - whispers at times not

5965.04 --> 5969.989
sure what entity spoke but I've had some

5967.56 --> 5975.469
weird stuff happening to me like roughly

5969.989 --> 5980.4
20 years ago I was just like I thought I

5975.469 --> 5982.61
am a warlock wizard whatever some kind

5980.4 --> 5985.23
of magic thing and I thought oh I'm I

5982.61 --> 5988.41
can perceive everything and that I

5985.23 --> 5990.629999999999
basically kind of like used my

5988.41 --> 5993.09
sensitivity a bit recklessly by putting

5990.63 --> 5998.43
myself too open there wasn't really

5993.09 --> 6002.51
healthy in retrospect but I remember

5998.43 --> 6004.67
having that kind of experience even with

6002.51 --> 6008.26
regular people but it seems like some

6004.67 --> 6008.26
people can even do it too

6015.13 --> 6019.51
or at least I think they were people I

6017.28 --> 6022.259999999999
don't know as I said I've had some weird

6019.51 --> 6022.26
experiences

6024.23 --> 6028.949
[Music]

6030.54 --> 6034.89
what are you talking about Karen B oh

6037.17 --> 6042.27
that's cool man a young that's

6039.429 --> 6042.27
fascinating

6044.88 --> 6056.77
yep I've only experienced it with

6048.52 --> 6059.05
females myself I think I even remember

6056.77 --> 6062.1990000000005
one time when I was still living with my

6059.05 --> 6065.9800000000005
ex-girlfriend when it was really good

6062.199 --> 6070.928999999999
that at some point I was like sleeping

6065.98 --> 6073.178999999999
half sleepy lying there and I thought my

6070.929 --> 6074.25
ex was talking to me and like was saying

6073.179 --> 6077.76
all kinds of things

6074.25 --> 6082.27
basically instructing me to do something

6077.76 --> 6084.7300000000005
or one wanting me to do something so I

6082.27 --> 6086.14
got up and then said okay I'll I'll do

6084.73 --> 6091.69
this and that and that and she was like

6086.14 --> 6095.14
wow and I was like you told me to do

6091.69 --> 6099.37
that right I heard you she was like no I

6095.14 --> 6101.14
I was thinking perhaps if I didn't tell

6099.37 --> 6105.28
you I you were sleeping I didn't want to

6101.14 --> 6112.59
wake you up so yeah but I've only ever

6105.28 --> 6115.87
experienced that with with girls and

6112.59 --> 6118.9490000000005
usually when there is a love bond

6115.87 --> 6118.949
[Music]

6120.339 --> 6127.089
again the openness hmm but the ad is

6124.749 --> 6129.249
very sporadic experience it's not

6127.089 --> 6131.789
something that I never experienced it

6129.249 --> 6131.789
constantly

6152.469 --> 6155.04
yeah

6158.249 --> 6164.909
yeah leaping for J it is isn't it ironic

6161.4 --> 6166.86
space oil digging yeah well dude space

6164.909 --> 6170.82
Legos man that's my thing

6166.86 --> 6176.639
I I prided myself in like making really

6170.82 --> 6178.228999999999
cool designs based on its like there

6176.639 --> 6180.179
were certain types of things they would

6178.229 --> 6182.519
sell with space Legos and I thought they

6180.179 --> 6187.4400000000005
were really cool and I tried to get as

6182.519 --> 6192.749
much as I could and then I would start

6187.44 --> 6194.789
to make my own modular designs kind of

6192.749 --> 6197.909
based on it but trying to improve on it

6194.789 --> 6198.63
to make it better space Legos I did that

6197.909 --> 6200.61
a lot

6198.63 --> 6203.34
I loved it and it was constantly

6200.61 --> 6208.44
fantasizing about that my room would be

6203.34 --> 6212.6990000000005
some giant crevice on a in atmosphere

6208.44 --> 6214.829
less planet and space we yeah my fantasy

6212.699 --> 6219.289
man I can still remember it man I was so

6214.829 --> 6219.289
into that it was awesome

6228.36 --> 6237.54
yeah I had a lot of a lot of fun with

6230.58 --> 6240.71
that car is in space yeah I had some

6237.54 --> 6245.15
space cars as well I had all kinds of

6240.71 --> 6245.15
transforming vehicles and stuff you know

6246.44 --> 6254.48
and I had like even specific modular

6251.22 --> 6257.52
designed super weapons and [ __ ] and

6254.48 --> 6259.08
getting all this war situation because I

6257.52 --> 6261.3
had different type of factions that I

6259.08 --> 6263.34
basically chose like a there's a covert

6261.3 --> 6265.53
war faction there's a over at war

6263.34 --> 6269.28
affection then there is a research

6265.53 --> 6272.099999999999
faction like mostly researchers and then

6269.28 --> 6274.65
there is defection that they're like

6272.1 --> 6277.08
polar planet well they already kind of

6274.65 --> 6280.349999999999
had their own thing but I really refine

6277.08 --> 6283.5
upon the designations and yeah and got

6280.35 --> 6285.26
it yeah kept the styles and perfected it

6283.5 --> 6290.97
as much as I could

6285.26 --> 6293.01
and what is it again yeah oh yeah the

6290.97 --> 6296.9400000000005
police faction I don't know I loved

6293.01 --> 6300.320000000001
space police you didn't wasn't too

6296.94 --> 6300.32
elaborate but I loved that thing

6301.07 --> 6309.29
you know what's cooler than being a cop

6303.93 --> 6309.29
in space space police

6314.45 --> 6321.91
can I please I just checked your space

6318.05 --> 6321.91
license and out-of-date

6329.769 --> 6337.249
yeah anyway

6332.659 --> 6342.009999999999
silly Lego stuff but I still had a good

6337.249 --> 6342.01
time with that like my preteens

6360.05 --> 6369.41
yes modern caveman I said Lego Legos the

6365.03 --> 6372.07
plastic building block thingies from

6369.41 --> 6372.07
Denmark

6373.17 --> 6376.279
[Music]

6381.94 --> 6390.53
well that's a good question leaping for

6385.22 --> 6395.63
J was it hard to let go of space before

6390.53 --> 6401.36
I woke well the joy I had with space had

6395.63 --> 6403.67
already kind of passed so and any time I

6401.36 --> 6405.679999999999
would be confronted with the concept of

6403.67 --> 6407.84
space not being real in any way when it

6405.68 --> 6410.150000000001
was really on would shock the [ __ ] out

6407.84 --> 6413.93
of me would hurt me deeply because I was

6410.15 --> 6414.79
constantly there in my mind in my

6413.93 --> 6421.400000000001
fantasy

6414.79 --> 6424.5199999999995
but yeah 2015 all of that is just more

6421.4 --> 6428.21
in my youth so I was concerning myself

6424.52 --> 6430.97
much more with with the with the real

6428.21 --> 6433.91
world and friend yeah you don't approach

6430.97 --> 6437.51
that with space because that's not you

6433.91 --> 6439.34
might want to go there sometime but

6437.51 --> 6443.12
that's not how you really that's no use

6439.34 --> 6445.6
so eventually 2015 it wasn't that big of

6443.12 --> 6448.94
a shock it was kind of heart-wrenching

6445.6 --> 6451.51
but I wasn't losing all these things

6448.94 --> 6454.69
that I engage i wasn't engaging

6451.51 --> 6456.9800000000005
regularly except for well the fantasy of

6454.69 --> 6463.61
designing space stations that kind of

6456.98 --> 6465.5
hurt but yeah then again even though it

6463.61 --> 6469.969999999999
turns out it's all fictional doesn't

6465.5 --> 6473.68
mean that you can't just continue it as

6469.97 --> 6476.990000000001
a game it's just never gonna be that

6473.68 --> 6479.35
important anymore that was the

6476.99 --> 6479.349999999999
difference

6486.769 --> 6489.46
right

6490.15 --> 6495.638999999999
indeed it does hurt the kid inside a

6492.699 --> 6498.04
little but hey my kid was already plenty

6495.639 --> 6506.61
hurt throughout my life because of other

6498.04 --> 6506.61
issues you know so I got used to that

6510.929 --> 6517.86
took a lot of time though it sounds Airy

6515.699 --> 6521.25
too romantic it took a long time to get

6517.86 --> 6523.469
used to the pain I kind of gothic yeah I

6521.25 --> 6526.26
guess that's also part of the reason why

6523.469 --> 6530.01
I even went there because I didn't know

6526.26 --> 6531.63
how to place all my over sensitivity and

6530.01 --> 6533.52
the hurt that I was experiencing that

6531.63 --> 6535.9800000000005
other people could not understand and

6533.52 --> 6539.369000000001
shared like why did you just get over

6535.98 --> 6542.73
that and yeah one of the thing about

6539.369 --> 6544.619
gothic is you kind of give it a place to

6542.73 --> 6549.239
drown in it perhaps seems kind of

6544.619 --> 6552.0599999999995
dramatic and and kind of yeah

6549.239 --> 6554.4
lame in retrospect but I didn't really

6552.06 --> 6558.2300000000005
know what else to do with it I thought I

6554.4 --> 6568.879999999999
could find some kind of purpose for it

6558.23 --> 6572.699
but yeah because of all that I think

6568.88 --> 6575.219
combined all of it I'm just able to

6572.699 --> 6579.839999999999
fully handle it now and decide upon like

6575.219 --> 6583.38
yeah I'm not going back I'm not gonna

6579.84 --> 6586.34
allow myself to believe illusions for my

6583.38 --> 6588.84
own personal escapism benefit anymore

6586.34 --> 6592.619000000001
not gonna do that no I'm gonna re

6588.84 --> 6594.4800000000005
approach it from a game perspective from

6592.619 --> 6596.94
an approach that I can't fantasize it's

6594.48 --> 6600.2699999999995
real that I can dream that deeply about

6596.94 --> 6605.82
it anymore not that vividly not like as

6600.27 --> 6607.71
if it were real but I can still

6605.82 --> 6610.199
experience it and just see it as a game

6607.71 --> 6612.119
and I like that game and I'm already so

6610.199 --> 6614.46
familiar with the game I'm now just

6612.119 --> 6618.0
figuring out how big tricks work how the

6614.46 --> 6622.4890000000005
games work and maybe ya can play a

6618.0 --> 6627.75
little with it in a non nefarious way

6622.489 --> 6630.33
and that's now how I deal with it so

6627.75 --> 6633.71
that yeah there's no more hurt I've been

6630.33 --> 6635.699
able to transit transition that process

6633.71 --> 6637.44
without too much trouble

6635.699 --> 6639.469
compared to a lot of other people I

6637.44 --> 6639.469
think

6660.75 --> 6666.69
yeah leapin 4j yeah me too I love space

6664.2 --> 6669.679999999999
movies I keep on watching and you know

6666.69 --> 6673.5599999999995
what I watched yesterday men in black 3

6669.68 --> 6675.570000000001
it's ridiculous it's like like the third

6673.56 --> 6681.330000000001
scene is like entirely surrounding the

6675.57 --> 6684.599999999999
Apollo 13 launch it's like serious very

6681.33 --> 6686.85
elaborate very very elaborate but yes

6684.6 --> 6688.8
even though I know Alcott yeah they're

6686.85 --> 6693.990000000001
trying to shove it in her face again I

6688.8 --> 6696.75
still thought it wasn't a really really

6693.99 --> 6699.33
interesting movie it was so weird to see

6696.75 --> 6701.34
it I've never seen it before I actually

6699.33 --> 6707.18
thought it was better than the first one

6701.34 --> 6707.18
I really did it was very surprising I

6707.42 --> 6717.09
thought it was it included time travel

6710.52 --> 6718.92
and it had a very it was good it was

6717.09 --> 6721.02
just good so if you haven't seen that

6718.92 --> 6722.61
one before and you'll kind of like men

6721.02 --> 6724.830000000001
in black and you thought the second one

6722.61 --> 6727.32
was kind of lame yeah I agree

6724.83 --> 6728.49
well the third one is so much better

6727.32 --> 6731.429999999999
it's just astounding

6728.49 --> 6735.03
oh Capricorn one is the one yeah right

6731.43 --> 6737.01
right I don't know it was an Apollo

6735.03 --> 6738.78
thingy I thought it was Apollo 13 I

6737.01 --> 6741.360000000001
don't I don't really care that much

6738.78 --> 6743.82
about the details it's just big freakin

6741.36 --> 6747.62
rocket the Space Launch with people in

6743.82 --> 6752.73
it and the story was very MacGuffin II

6747.62 --> 6756.03
but there was good character acting and

6752.73 --> 6759.78
I thought that the plot what time

6756.03 --> 6762.2699999999995
concerning Lee was very good and not

6759.78 --> 6764.75
over convoluted and that's very

6762.27 --> 6767.820000000001
impressive these days because with time

6764.75 --> 6770.61
related storylines it's always gets so

6767.82 --> 6772.679999999999
convoluted and annoying nowadays because

6770.61 --> 6776.009999999999
it's been done endlessly but in this one

6772.68 --> 6780.59
it was just basic and good and simple

6776.01 --> 6783.860000000001
and I didn't see it coming it was good

6780.59 --> 6788.039
very effective utilization of

6783.86 --> 6792.9
time-travel concept very effective

6788.039 --> 6796.619
so hmm yeah I thought it was a good

6792.9 --> 6799.679
movie and bid weird to round out on that

6796.619 --> 6805.5
this but yeah I've been going for almost

6799.679 --> 6810.539
two hours on an hour and 50 minutes so I

6805.5 --> 6815.309
think I'm gonna round out the show or

6810.539 --> 6819.3
fifty an hour and fifty three so have I

6815.309 --> 6822.9890000000005
seen the Joker yet no I haven't I've

6819.3 --> 6824.9400000000005
heard a lot about it a lot and I will

6822.989 --> 6828.36
probably see it at some point but it's

6824.94 --> 6830.159
yeah it's not a Netflix not that I've

6828.36 --> 6831.869
seen at least maybe I'm wrong maybe it

6830.159 --> 6834.21
is there I will I will take a look

6831.869 --> 6836.509999999999
anyway I am gonna round out the show so
