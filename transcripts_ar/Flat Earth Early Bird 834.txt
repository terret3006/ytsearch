156.0 --> 159.68
so yeah it is

160.64 --> 170.39999999999998
tuesday 16th of march 2021

166.48 --> 173.599
i'm starting a little late

170.4 --> 175.44
uh because i

173.599 --> 177.67999999999998
got up kind of late i had a very late

175.44 --> 177.68
night

182.84 --> 190.239
so

185.519 --> 192.64000000000001
uh hello brent m first in chat good to

190.239 --> 192.64000000000001
see you

192.959 --> 196.56
yeah yesterday's flat earth debate was

196.239 --> 199.59900000000002
like

196.56 --> 201.44
really crowded again kind of the typical

199.599 --> 204.0
monday

201.44 --> 207.92
everybody had a real tendency to

204.0 --> 207.92
basically break into sentences

208.239 --> 213.28
and with like eight panels on the

211.599 --> 215.04
eight members on the panel that was kind

213.28 --> 218.0
of a

215.04 --> 218.0
bit of a hassle but

218.159 --> 226.319
i stayed in the background most of it

221.36 --> 230.56
ah watched owen benjamin

226.319 --> 232.64
go live somewhere after that on the

230.56 --> 234.319
uh tea time with the gary and terry

232.64 --> 238.319
channel

234.319 --> 238.72
and oh yeah much later in the evening i

238.319 --> 240.879
did

238.72 --> 242.239
actually watch the official secrets

240.879 --> 245.28
movie i think

242.239 --> 245.68
so here we go again recommended that to

245.28 --> 248.959
me

245.68 --> 251.84
and yeah it was pretty uh was a very

248.959 --> 251.84
intense movie

252.08 --> 259.28000000000003
very tense movie a lot

255.68 --> 262.56
and also interesting to to get a

259.28 --> 262.55999999999995
good what is it that

265.04 --> 272.16
dramatic representation of real events

268.8 --> 276.16
basically on which the movie was based

272.16 --> 279.36
from that time when

276.16 --> 282.639
was it the tony blair and

279.36 --> 286.56
bush jr basically used

282.639 --> 287.84000000000003
the 911 as sort of a backdrop excuse to

286.56 --> 290.479
start

287.84 --> 292.4
attacking iraq and this is about

290.479 --> 296.96
journalism

292.4 --> 298.08
in england concerning that it was very

296.96 --> 301.19899999999996
interesting to

298.08 --> 303.59999999999997
yeah to see that again or well i don't

301.199 --> 306.72
think i've seen this movie before but

303.6 --> 308.56
it was good to indirectly look through

306.72 --> 311.68
that situation again

308.56 --> 317.199
so yeah it was a pretty good movie

311.68 --> 317.199
uh much later lift the veil

317.28 --> 324.88
i pretty much went out on that

321.039 --> 338.88
so that's why it got a little late

324.88 --> 342.08
little territ306 rob h m

338.88 --> 342.08
how are you all doing

349.44 --> 356.56
so i'm yeah pretty much up for subjects

353.12 --> 358.319
got a full show again at least an hour

356.56 --> 361.44
45 minutes

358.319 --> 361.44
so bring it on

364.16 --> 369.03900000000004
yeah hi sean hawkins yeah that's pretty

367.039 --> 372.31899999999996
much the

369.039 --> 375.36
the gist of it also in that movie

372.319 --> 375.36
they expressed that

378.84 --> 384.479
um

380.56 --> 384.479
yeah so i've got green tea with me here

392.88 --> 395.84
right

414.599 --> 425.039
720 seconds late all right so

422.96 --> 426.08
i may be a little slow in the first half

425.039 --> 429.759
part of the show

426.08 --> 431.52
because yeah i did get up pretty late

429.759 --> 434.08000000000004
i'm still in the middle of kind of

431.52 --> 434.08
waking up

434.639 --> 438.639
i did have it have a good sleep though

445.12 --> 451.28000000000003
and i already lunched which i really

447.12 --> 454.479
needed i was very hungry

451.28 --> 457.599
but now my metabolism is working on that

454.479 --> 459.599
and slows me down a little

457.599 --> 462.56
because i basically finished it not even

459.599 --> 462.56
15 minutes ago

462.72 --> 470.639
and but i'll get

466.16 --> 474.56
back to my focus

470.639 --> 478.08
whatever subject comes by ah

474.56 --> 481.28000000000003
right so

478.08 --> 483.68
i think was it

481.28 --> 486.15999999999997
yeah there's been a lot of uh media

483.68 --> 488.24
negative media attention about situation

486.16 --> 491.84000000000003
here in the netherlands

488.24 --> 494.16
i think i addressed it just microscopic

491.84 --> 498.71999999999997
bit yesterday about

494.16 --> 500.72
yeah protests in amsterdam i think it is

498.72 --> 502.0
against the corona lockdown measures and

500.72 --> 504.96000000000004
all that that just were

502.0 --> 506.16
very harsh and a lot of it was on

504.96 --> 510.31899999999996
footage

506.16 --> 513.44
was on camera it's like

510.319 --> 515.6800000000001
police dogs and just

513.44 --> 516.6400000000001
overall kind of terrible behavior on the

515.68 --> 522.0
police's part

516.64 --> 524.8
like really so that didn't look good

522.0 --> 525.6
and yeah that that stuff is now like

524.8 --> 527.68
everywhere

525.6 --> 528.8000000000001
so pretty much everyone in the world

527.68 --> 534.88
knows that now

528.8 --> 537.8389999999999
that great that's just great

534.88 --> 538.88
not that i want to hide it it's just

537.839 --> 541.44
that

538.88 --> 542.399
kind of embarrassing supposed to be a

541.44 --> 545.36
free country

542.399 --> 545.839
netherlands always writing that [ __ ]

545.36 --> 549.279
well

545.839 --> 552.08
that didn't lick all that freedom based

549.279 --> 552.08
if you know what i mean

554.32 --> 559.6800000000001
so that did happen also although yeah it

556.959 --> 562.7199999999999
wasn't a weekend

559.68 --> 566.64
getting a lot of news articles

562.72 --> 566.64
referencing it everywhere

573.36 --> 578.5600000000001
uh yeah tara 306 how much more will they

577.36 --> 580.88
fake space

578.56 --> 582.8
you have any new methods ideas for

580.88 --> 584.64
faking space

582.8 --> 586.0799999999999
well if i would i'm not just gonna lay

584.64 --> 590.24
them out here

586.08 --> 593.9200000000001
look i am not going to be

590.24 --> 594.9590000000001
some kind of leeching instruction board

593.92 --> 597.4399999999999
for nasa

594.959 --> 599.5999999999999
literally telling them how to freaking

597.44 --> 602.0
fake their business

599.6 --> 603.12
while they get paid billions and i don't

602.0 --> 607.04
get paid [ __ ]

603.12 --> 610.88
yeah so even if i did have methods

607.04 --> 611.68
and ideas [ __ ] them where's my freaking

610.88 --> 614.079
6 million

611.68 --> 618.7199999999999
i'm not gonna do [ __ ] like that yeah

614.079 --> 622.56
it's their freaking problem

618.72 --> 622.5600000000001
sure i could i'm not gonna

627.92 --> 636.0
uh hello rich g

630.959 --> 636.0
from sc welcome in my chat

642.56 --> 646.7199999999999
yeah now terry 3 6 i'm not going to give

644.64 --> 649.04
the grappler ideas let them just squirt

646.72 --> 649.0400000000001
it out

655.279 --> 658.399
oh you were told well you're stupid

657.92 --> 661.8389999999999
because

658.399 --> 661.839
you're looking at me right now

674.72 --> 677.9200000000001
see right here

684.0 --> 687.519
so anybody else got any relevant

686.399 --> 691.04
question

687.519 --> 692.72
that's not self-defeating or basically

691.04 --> 703.279
already answered

692.72 --> 717.839
without words that will be cool

703.279 --> 717.8389999999999
let's see what else is going around

728.839 --> 731.839
um

738.72 --> 741.9200000000001
or not i'm just gonna sit here say

741.2 --> 744.5600000000001
nothing

741.92 --> 747.1999999999999
wait until somebody pops up in chat and

744.56 --> 748.6389999999999
gets things going

747.2 --> 750.32
if it's that kind of a day then it's

748.639 --> 752.48
that kind of a day i'll just sit here

750.32 --> 759.839
and be silent then

752.48 --> 759.839
right it's up to you guys

762.16 --> 765.279
he'll use centers and teach his son will

764.24 --> 766.9590000000001
die

765.279 --> 769.4399999999999
do you think it will no of course it's

766.959 --> 772.2399999999999
not that's ridiculous

769.44 --> 773.0400000000001
first off the sun isn't an object

772.24 --> 775.6800000000001
doesn't live

773.04 --> 777.36
and it's not gonna die second off even

775.68 --> 780.399
within heliocentrism

777.36 --> 787.839
the way they portray this idea takes

780.399 --> 787.839
billions of years so no

796.16 --> 802.88
well i don't know which guy this was

799.36 --> 802.88
but he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

806.16 --> 809.8389999999999
maybe you shouldn't listen to really

808.88 --> 813.76
stupid

809.839 --> 814.48
stories right really stupid stories like

813.76 --> 817.68
that

814.48 --> 820.5600000000001
because that never happens

817.68 --> 823.279
if it would it would literally be all

820.56 --> 826.2399999999999
over the news

823.279 --> 828.16
not because it's me but because of yeah

826.24 --> 830.32
something like that with balcony

828.16 --> 833.199
failures and [ __ ]

830.32 --> 835.7600000000001
that would be all over the place right

833.199 --> 838.4799999999999
and besides i'm here now live

835.76 --> 840.399
so to ask that question is

838.48 --> 843.9200000000001
self-defeating and really dumb

840.399 --> 845.04
because i am here live for you to ask

843.92 --> 848.8
the question

845.04 --> 848.8
so you already have an answer to the

854.839 --> 857.839
question

865.519 --> 871.839
i would consider myself a new from you

869.199 --> 875.519
i don't know man i'm not very alpha like

871.839 --> 878.48
that i am very unrelenting

875.519 --> 880.5600000000001
as in like i don't give a [ __ ] i'm not

878.48 --> 881.519
really holding back and i'm not gonna

880.56 --> 884.56
adapt to

881.519 --> 886.5600000000001
shitty sheep level communication

884.56 --> 888.7199999999999
so if you think that makes me an alpha

886.56 --> 894.3199999999999
male then i'm an alpha male

888.72 --> 894.32
but i don't really feel like that

896.959 --> 900.6389999999999
i'm a loner and alpha males are not

899.519 --> 913.279
really typical

900.639 --> 916.16
loners like that

913.279 --> 916.16
hello brenda

917.6 --> 921.0400000000001
joey cleaner i don't know who that is

920.24 --> 924.32
dude

921.04 --> 924.3199999999999
i don't really care too

924.8 --> 929.68
he's a stupid fantasist and probably a

927.279 --> 930.72
little squirt boy if he has to fantasize

929.68 --> 933.3599999999999
about me dying

930.72 --> 934.5600000000001
right so that i can finally get out of

933.36 --> 936.72
his head

934.56 --> 937.8389999999999
yeah which is never gonna happen you're

936.72 --> 942.48
gonna have me stuck

937.839 --> 945.1990000000001
in there forever dude even beyond death

942.48 --> 945.519
i'm never gonna go away even if i die

945.199 --> 948.639
i'm

945.519 --> 950.5600000000001
never gonna go away i'm gonna be part of

948.639 --> 953.04
this

950.56 --> 953.7589999999999
this learning process i am already part

953.04 --> 957.04
of it

953.759 --> 961.519
i'm gonna be part of it forever

957.04 --> 964.7199999999999
you understand you can never get me away

961.519 --> 967.04
you can do to my body

964.72 --> 968.0
things potentially not that you're going

967.04 --> 969.92
to

968.0 --> 972.48
even if you did i'm never going to go

969.92 --> 974.639
away because i have been here

972.48 --> 976.8000000000001
i have been part of the learning process

974.639 --> 981.279
you can never get rid of that again

976.8 --> 984.3199999999999
yeah i have always been

981.279 --> 987.68
that can never be undone

984.32 --> 989.0400000000001
so even if whatever erasal of history

987.68 --> 992.079
blah blah blah

989.04 --> 992.399
i was there people have seen it people

992.079 --> 995.199
know

992.399 --> 996.72
i was there it's up to them how they

995.199 --> 999.3599999999999
hold on to their memories

996.72 --> 1000.9590000000001
i have always been there because i was

999.36 --> 1004.32
there

1000.959 --> 1006.079
yeah never gonna go away so fantasize

1004.32 --> 1010.0
about my death all you like

1006.079 --> 1014.8
i'm never gonna go away you understand

1010.0 --> 1014.8
yeah keep squirting for me

1023.519 --> 1039.839
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1027.679 --> 1039.8390000000002
foul on buchanan

1057.76 --> 1062.559
yeah well brenda your standard of alpha

1060.4 --> 1068.0800000000002
is not

1062.559 --> 1068.08
all that irrelevant that's fine right

1068.799 --> 1074.8799999999999
don't understand really the stealth

1070.96 --> 1078.799
player or rogue i'm pretty much

1074.88 --> 1082.16
around for people to listen to

1078.799 --> 1083.36
and take advice on anything and i think

1082.16 --> 1087.28
a lot of people

1083.36 --> 1090.0
know it by now

1087.28 --> 1090.96
people know it even if they don't know

1090.0 --> 1094.4
me

1090.96 --> 1097.8400000000001
they look at me and they know it

1094.4 --> 1099.8400000000001
even if they don't understand so it

1097.84 --> 1101.039
whatever that is i don't even know if

1099.84 --> 1103.84
like alpha

1101.039 --> 1106.799
beta gamma all that [ __ ] even has

1103.84 --> 1110.0
anything to do with it anymore

1106.799 --> 1114.08
i am arwyn i

1110.0 --> 1117.039
know [ __ ] i see through

1114.08 --> 1117.039
a lot of things

1117.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
and i speak the truth

1127.2 --> 1130.32
hello tom parker

1149.76 --> 1153.44
in a game or in a game what what frick

1153.2 --> 1156.96
is

1153.44 --> 1158.88
alpha it's nonsense alpha has to do with

1156.96 --> 1160.88
social hierarchy

1158.88 --> 1162.0
video games are not about social

1160.88 --> 1165.679
hierarchy

1162.0 --> 1166.32
it's combat right with combat it has

1165.679 --> 1168.88
nothing

1166.32 --> 1170.1599999999999
it has nothing to do with the social

1168.88 --> 1174.48
hierarchy

1170.16 --> 1174.48
it's kind of silly to suggest that

1175.919 --> 1179.6000000000001
right in the game you got other

1177.36 --> 1183.039
categories you got

1179.6 --> 1187.28
you got the stealthy you got the brawn

1183.039 --> 1193.44
you got the tank

1187.28 --> 1195.44
you got the buffer all those things

1193.44 --> 1198.0
tanker palace yeah well i'm not going to

1195.44 --> 1200.0800000000002
be there to take a lot of hits

1198.0 --> 1201.28
so in that sense i'm definitely not a

1200.08 --> 1204.8799999999999
tank

1201.28 --> 1207.9189999999999
and but i am

1204.88 --> 1210.0800000000002
with paladin qualities though i'm just

1207.919 --> 1212.4
not gonna sit on that front line taking

1210.08 --> 1215.6789999999999
all the hits

1212.4 --> 1215.679
that's not what i'm here for

1216.32 --> 1221.84
that's not where my qualities really

1218.0 --> 1221.84
come out

1222.11 --> 1225.1999999999998
[Music]

1235.039 --> 1238.4
so it's kind of a silly comparison there

1237.039 --> 1241.44
brenda

1238.4 --> 1243.3600000000001
don't know why you would i i guess that

1241.44 --> 1244.48
by now with my presence here on the

1243.36 --> 1247.36
internet and what i do

1244.48 --> 1249.1200000000001
i have become kind of this figure that

1247.36 --> 1251.4399999999998
people

1249.12 --> 1253.9189999999999
think about all day long and then try to

1251.44 --> 1255.44
put in a box somehow yeah how do you put

1253.919 --> 1257.679
irwin in a box which

1255.44 --> 1259.44
category does he fit best oh yeah it

1257.679 --> 1261.6000000000001
doesn't really fit anywhere

1259.44 --> 1263.3600000000001
completely now does it oh yeah every

1261.6 --> 1264.0
time it's like uh it is this and it's

1263.36 --> 1267.1999999999998
the

1264.0 --> 1271.6
opposite side oh yeah i know

1267.2 --> 1272.32
i know i you can't really shove me in a

1271.6 --> 1275.6
box

1272.32 --> 1281.12
you know pretty much made sure that my

1275.6 --> 1281.12
entire life that you won't be able to do

1288.84 --> 1291.84
that

1301.6 --> 1305.76
right yeah so how about the uh

1306.32 --> 1310.24
the massively massively failing global

1309.36 --> 1312.32
defenses

1310.24 --> 1313.919
how about that guys why don't you think

1312.32 --> 1315.28
about that isn't that a little bit more

1313.919 --> 1317.679
urgent

1315.28 --> 1319.039
how your side is either not engaging

1317.679 --> 1321.3600000000001
anymore

1319.039 --> 1323.6
because they know they will not come out

1321.36 --> 1326.559
a winner

1323.6 --> 1327.039
or they try and just stumble and fool

1326.559 --> 1329.84
around

1327.039 --> 1332.96
end up with like juvenile behavior every

1329.84 --> 1336.48
single time

1332.96 --> 1337.2
totally defeated right i know you would

1336.48 --> 1340.799
love to

1337.2 --> 1342.559
imagine more about

1340.799 --> 1344.1589999999999
individuals you know look at the

1342.559 --> 1346.0
individual let's let's play with our

1344.159 --> 1347.8400000000001
dolls again let's not think about the

1346.0 --> 1351.2
situation that is happening

1347.84 --> 1353.6
right there right right there daily

1351.2 --> 1355.44
every day you wake up to it oh yeah the

1353.6 --> 1357.039
globe's defeated

1355.44 --> 1359.039
well let's play with our dolls again

1357.039 --> 1360.08
let's look at the figure heads on there

1359.039 --> 1363.039
let's just imagine

1360.08 --> 1364.0
oh what would they be like in a video

1363.039 --> 1366.799
game

1364.0 --> 1367.28
how do i socially classify them yeah

1366.799 --> 1370.0
yeah

1367.28 --> 1371.44
in the meantime the globe is absolutely

1370.0 --> 1375.28
defeated

1371.44 --> 1378.159
absolutely defeated i know you like to

1375.28 --> 1378.1589999999999
distract from that

1383.2 --> 1391.88
oh my god now tara 306 simon dan

1388.159 --> 1395.8400000000001
is not an alpha he is classic

1391.88 --> 1397.7600000000002
classic gamma classic

1395.84 --> 1400.24
like he has all the traits all the

1397.76 --> 1400.24
traits

1401.039 --> 1403.84
all of it

1408.08 --> 1414.72
yeah chant for me brenda tell me how

1411.2 --> 1417.8400000000001
it's not defeated no

1414.72 --> 1420.24
yeah yeah you woke up and it was

1417.84 --> 1420.24
again

1421.2 --> 1426.24
so maybe chant it to your morning chant

1424.4 --> 1428.3200000000002
the globe's not defeated the club's not

1426.24 --> 1432.24
defeated the club's not defeated

1428.32 --> 1435.9189999999999
and maybe for the time being you can

1432.24 --> 1439.2
convince yourself about it so you can

1435.919 --> 1445.8400000000001
continue on their sidly

1439.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
little life on the globe

1456.84 --> 1459.84
it

1465.76 --> 1469.44
yeah yeah nathan it is uh typical isn't

1469.039 --> 1471.12
it

1469.44 --> 1473.3600000000001
maybe we just have to get on their

1471.12 --> 1476.6399999999999
channel

1473.36 --> 1478.9599999999998
so that they can pretend like debating

1476.64 --> 1480.0
doesn't work the way it does and when

1478.96 --> 1483.919
claims are made

1480.0 --> 1486.48
and rebutted that doesn't mean defeat

1483.919 --> 1488.3200000000002
so let's just talk about the format

1486.48 --> 1490.72
let's just talk about something else

1488.32 --> 1494.32
let's quickly move on to this

1490.72 --> 1496.32
dig deeply dug in detail

1494.32 --> 1497.84
based on every single presupposition

1496.32 --> 1500.32
that the globe model

1497.84 --> 1501.1999999999998
actually requires and let's speculate

1500.32 --> 1503.9189999999999
about that

1501.2 --> 1505.279
yeah was that what you were going to do

1503.919 --> 1508.0800000000002
brenda

1505.279 --> 1510.64
because that's what every baller does

1508.08 --> 1513.76
every time

1510.64 --> 1514.88
you're defeated all your strategies are

1513.76 --> 1517.44
transparent

1514.88 --> 1518.5590000000002
all your strategies are defeated there

1517.44 --> 1521.8400000000001
is nothing

1518.559 --> 1524.8799999999999
you can do only

1521.84 --> 1528.1589999999999
way you can

1524.88 --> 1530.64
imagine not being defeated is by

1528.159 --> 1533.2
imagining you're not being defeated

1530.64 --> 1536.96
because imagination is the only place

1533.2 --> 1539.44
left right it's the only place left

1536.96 --> 1541.6000000000001
where you're not

1539.44 --> 1543.2
right every other field every other

1541.6 --> 1557.84
angle to the situation

1543.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
you are the globe is defeated

1559.12 --> 1563.039
now come on seeking star wars don't get

1561.2 --> 1565.919
all literal arguments you know they

1563.039 --> 1565.919
can't handle that

1568.84 --> 1574.72
uh

1570.4 --> 1574.72
uh hey amanda young good to see you

1580.72 --> 1584.88
yeah that's right any fonza a sphere has

1582.88 --> 1588.72
an edge

1584.88 --> 1592.24
it's one giant edge

1588.72 --> 1595.279
it's the thing that separates the sphere

1592.24 --> 1599.44
from the nut sphere that surrounds it

1595.279 --> 1613.84
and it obstructs things

1599.44 --> 1613.8400000000001
that's the sphere edge

1614.799 --> 1620.48
look at that only floors claim the

1618.0 --> 1623.679
horizon should be geometric

1620.48 --> 1623.679
nice straw man

1624.0 --> 1633.039
oh my god look at that

1627.44 --> 1633.039
look at that isn't that just cute

1638.559 --> 1644.08
yeah that that one really made me smile

1641.2 --> 1644.0800000000002
that's so funny

1650.48 --> 1654.48
so yeah yeah let's uh let's discuss some

1653.52 --> 1657.2
semantics

1654.48 --> 1658.72
well the proof that the earth is

1657.2 --> 1661.76
supposedly a globe is

1658.72 --> 1663.279
absolutely absent in every conceivable

1661.76 --> 1666.84
form

1663.279 --> 1670.08
physically empirically mechanically

1666.84 --> 1673.12
philosophically yeah

1670.08 --> 1675.9189999999999
every field every

1673.12 --> 1677.279
field including its own machinations

1675.919 --> 1680.72
every field

1677.279 --> 1685.6
the globe is defeated it is the most

1680.72 --> 1687.6000000000001
defeated philosophy ever devised

1685.6 --> 1697.84
you still believe it though can't let it

1687.6 --> 1697.84
go can you

1701.12 --> 1706.0
yeah i see that nathan isn't that just

1704.0 --> 1709.279
special

1706.0 --> 1712.32
it's like how is ridic why would flat

1709.279 --> 1715.76
earthers think that the horizon would be

1712.32 --> 1719.12
geometric you know on a globe it's

1715.76 --> 1722.559
it's like well because of

1719.12 --> 1726.08
geometry you know if sphere is a

1722.559 --> 1728.399
geometric shape it should definitely be

1726.08 --> 1731.76
cutting off things in a persistent

1728.399 --> 1733.1999999999998
way and that would be considered the

1731.76 --> 1736.84
horizon

1733.2 --> 1739.6000000000001
the geometric horizon cutting off things

1736.84 --> 1740.72
visually because yeah this sphere you're

1739.6 --> 1743.36
standing on is

1740.72 --> 1745.52
obstructing things in the distance right

1743.36 --> 1747.6789999999999
that geometry

1745.52 --> 1748.799
you you don't understand it anymore it's

1747.679 --> 1751.3600000000001
oh oh it's

1748.799 --> 1752.96
it's now just this wireframe model in a

1751.36 --> 1755.4399999999998
rendering now

1752.96 --> 1756.72
or is not a graphic few side drawing is

1755.44 --> 1760.0
it

1756.72 --> 1762.72
that's what it is now right yet we know

1760.0 --> 1763.039
because the real world you're standing

1762.72 --> 1766.08
on

1763.039 --> 1768.399
is not a sphere we know that's why there

1766.08 --> 1770.6399999999999
isn't a geometric horizon

1768.399 --> 1772.32
that is why there is black swan

1770.64 --> 1776.0800000000002
observations

1772.32 --> 1781.84
because the horizon isn't geometric

1776.08 --> 1781.84
because the earth is not a globe

1792.84 --> 1795.84
uh

1796.96 --> 1801.1200000000001
oh my god but yeah let's complain some

1800.08 --> 1804.559
more about oh

1801.12 --> 1806.399
spirit services don't have any edge

1804.559 --> 1808.08
you don't have an edge yeah yeah there's

1806.399 --> 1809.4399999999998
two different meanings of the word edge

1808.08 --> 1812.799
though in that you know

1809.44 --> 1815.8400000000001
you have like the geometric

1812.799 --> 1818.6399999999999
edge like an edge

1815.84 --> 1819.039
versus a flat part right an edge yeah

1818.64 --> 1820.48
yeah

1819.039 --> 1824.1589999999999
that's not the type of edge i'm

1820.48 --> 1828.64
referring to i know it's so hard for you

1824.159 --> 1830.88
you can't get away from it you can't

1828.64 --> 1832.3200000000002
yeah there's another form of edge though

1830.88 --> 1835.3600000000001
it's the optical edge

1832.32 --> 1839.12
yeah you look at it

1835.36 --> 1843.279
and then it cuts things off

1839.12 --> 1846.08
where it is the object the geometry

1843.279 --> 1846.64
the separation between the object and

1846.08 --> 1851.12
the

1846.64 --> 1854.48
not object visually visually

1851.12 --> 1856.1589999999999
yeah edge edge yeah that's where a

1854.48 --> 1859.44
sphere has an edge

1856.159 --> 1861.679
one circular edge

1859.44 --> 1865.8400000000001
that's the edge of the sphere it's not a

1861.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
geometric edge it's not a little corner

1866.08 --> 1872.559
in the geometric shape no it is

1869.12 --> 1875.6789999999999
the cutoff point visually

1872.559 --> 1879.44
of where the sphere

1875.679 --> 1883.6000000000001
separates from the not sphere

1879.44 --> 1886.3990000000001
that's the sphere edge i know

1883.6 --> 1886.399
so painful

1886.88 --> 1890.96
maybe you need to keep chanting some

1888.799 --> 1892.8799999999999
more how about spheres have no edges and

1890.96 --> 1893.6000000000001
you never claim the geometric horizon

1892.88 --> 1897.0390000000002
because only

1893.6 --> 1906.399
flerfs claim

1897.039 --> 1909.039
a geometric horizon right

1906.399 --> 1910.399
right so yeah you got to keep it apart

1909.039 --> 1916.559
you know it's

1910.399 --> 1916.559
geometric horizon not geometric edge

1916.64 --> 1924.5590000000002
sphere edge geometric

1920.559 --> 1928.32
horizon not geometric

1924.559 --> 1933.12
edge spheric horizon no sphere

1928.32 --> 1935.6789999999999
edge geometric horizon

1933.12 --> 1937.039
i know it's so tough get it all mixed up

1935.679 --> 1941.1200000000001
it's all goo in there

1937.039 --> 1943.12
i know it's what you get

1941.12 --> 1944.9599999999998
when you're constantly drinking

1943.12 --> 1947.36
cognitive dissonance

1944.96 --> 1948.24
your head starts to have a lot of

1947.36 --> 1950.6399999999999
trouble

1948.24 --> 1951.44
keeping the word straight because you're

1950.64 --> 1954.7990000000002
using

1951.44 --> 1955.6000000000001
mixing up interpretations of words as a

1954.799 --> 1958.08
tactic

1955.6 --> 1958.799
on a regular basis and guess what

1958.08 --> 1961.519
happens

1958.799 --> 1963.9189999999999
oh yeah it gets really confusing when

1961.519 --> 1966.96
you tactically misunderstand

1963.919 --> 1970.0
arguments and words yeah who

1966.96 --> 1971.519
could have seen that coming huh who

1970.0 --> 1974.08
could have seen that coming if you

1971.519 --> 1974.88
on purpose misunderstand words and mix

1974.08 --> 1976.799
them up

1974.88 --> 1978.3200000000002
that you might have a little trouble

1976.799 --> 1981.76
with it at some point

1978.32 --> 1982.8799999999999
yeah that's what happens that's what

1981.76 --> 1985.76
happens

1982.88 --> 1988.8400000000001
that's the price that's the price for

1985.76 --> 1991.84
your stupid little belief

1988.84 --> 1991.84
huh

2009.919 --> 2018.24
uh rufus and hubbard i don't think it is

2011.919 --> 2019.919
really relevant to anything

2018.24 --> 2022.72
hiding results because it showed

2019.919 --> 2023.1200000000001
rotation no mechanical gyros don't show

2022.72 --> 2025.6000000000001
that

2023.12 --> 2027.279
that's ridiculous it's only the fiber

2025.6 --> 2028.24
optic gyro that ever showed any

2027.279 --> 2031.6
deviation

2028.24 --> 2034.08
or drift don't be ridiculous rufus and

2031.6 --> 2034.08
hubbins

2035.919 --> 2042.64
this is really getting kind of silly

2039.519 --> 2046.32
but yeah maybe you could trick me into

2042.64 --> 2048.96
saying certain things without realizing

2046.32 --> 2050.96
the misleading elements about it maybe

2048.96 --> 2053.76
maybe you could let it slip through

2050.96 --> 2057.28
maybe one time arwen will not pick up on

2053.76 --> 2061.8390000000004
it and just slap you in the face with it

2057.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
maybe maybe one day

2067.04 --> 2075.839
it's ridiculous

2076.639 --> 2082.639
just found out what what are you talking

2079.919 --> 2082.6389999999997
about rufus

2086.879 --> 2092.3199999999997
some new thing i don't think so

2090.079 --> 2094.5600000000004
i don't think bob's touched the gyro in

2092.32 --> 2096.7200000000003
a long time now

2094.56 --> 2098.56
since ballers falsely claimed he

2096.72 --> 2099.4399999999996
supposedly proved the rotation of the

2098.56 --> 2102.96
earth with it

2099.44 --> 2103.839
right which was only the ring laser

2102.96 --> 2108.4
gyroscope

2103.839 --> 2108.4
not the other ones not a physical ones

2114.839 --> 2117.839
right

2129.68 --> 2133.839
hey neil cosentino good to see you good

2131.92 --> 2135.6800000000003
to have you in here

2133.839 --> 2138.0789999999997
yeah we got some real baller squirters

2135.68 --> 2138.0789999999997
in here

2141.359 --> 2145.359
i'll hear about it soon what did they

2143.28 --> 2146.0
bring that up on the globe busters is

2145.359 --> 2148.0
bob now

2146.0 --> 2150.0
actually trying to actively prove the

2148.0 --> 2152.48
globe with his nonsense

2150.0 --> 2154.16
or is he pursuing the ether rotation

2152.48 --> 2157.28
nonsense

2154.16 --> 2173.839
rufus said hubbens i literally this just

2157.28 --> 2173.8390000000004
seems a little silly to me

2178.72 --> 2182.9599999999996
lol the first okay well why don't you

2181.28 --> 2184.5600000000004
get specific

2182.96 --> 2186.96
otherwise i'm going to continue

2184.56 --> 2201.839
classifying you as a troll

2186.96 --> 2201.839
how about that

2211.119 --> 2215.839
all right well dude that's fine look if

2213.44 --> 2218.32
bob wants to become a glober to become

2215.839 --> 2219.119
relevant again because he's so much

2218.32 --> 2222.48
failing

2219.119 --> 2222.88
with his stupid little alternative flat

2222.48 --> 2226.96
earth

2222.88 --> 2228.0
nasa project oh let him go back to the

2226.96 --> 2230.4
globe

2228.0 --> 2231.68
just goes to show he doesn't give a [ __ ]

2230.4 --> 2233.599
about anything

2231.68 --> 2234.96
the only [ __ ] thing he cares about is

2233.599 --> 2237.839
that he is king and

2234.96 --> 2239.92
everybody has their eyes on little bob

2237.839 --> 2241.359
who gives a [ __ ] what that guys is do we

2239.92 --> 2244.64
can shove all his

2241.359 --> 2247.92
balls and equipments and gyroscopes up

2244.64 --> 2247.92
it asks for a like here

2251.76 --> 2255.76
he's a freaking maniac the guy is a

2254.4 --> 2259.359
maniac

2255.76 --> 2263.6800000000003
he acts like a maniac

2259.359 --> 2267.5989999999997
he talks like a maniac he's a completely

2263.68 --> 2270.7999999999997
an actor on camera verbally never

2267.599 --> 2275.6800000000003
speaks like a normal person in chats

2270.8 --> 2275.6800000000003
never speaks like a normal person

2278.0 --> 2285.839
gives a [ __ ] what he's doing

2289.839 --> 2294.32
yeah they pick bob yeah yeah that's what

2291.92 --> 2294.32
you get

2294.8 --> 2316.0
losers pick losers that's what happens

2312.96 --> 2316.0
but uh yeah

2316.24 --> 2320.3199999999997
i serious ruth saint hobbins i i don't

2319.119 --> 2322.88
think you uh

2320.32 --> 2327.839
that's you're not you can't be serious

2322.88 --> 2327.839
serious you can't be serious

2332.96 --> 2336.2400000000002
like unless he's literally gone

2335.359 --> 2340.0789999999997
literally

2336.24 --> 2344.0
clinically out of his mind

2340.079 --> 2346.32
with measurable psychotic effects

2344.0 --> 2347.92
it doesn't make any damn sense what you

2346.32 --> 2349.2000000000003
just said about him

2347.92 --> 2355.839
what he's supposedly done with the

2349.2 --> 2355.839
gyroscope that makes no freaking sense

2360.88 --> 2365.119
yeah and also physical gyroscopes don't

2364.4 --> 2367.92
drift

2365.119 --> 2368.48
they don't drift over time they don't

2367.92 --> 2371.92
drift

2368.48 --> 2375.44
when you move over the earth at

2371.92 --> 2377.76
distances they don't drift physical

2375.44 --> 2378.079
gyroscopes don't drift because the earth

2377.76 --> 2381.28
is

2378.079 --> 2383.2000000000003
flat and stationary and as a

2381.28 --> 2384.96
side effect of this and natural

2383.2 --> 2387.52
consequences

2384.96 --> 2388.48
right it's a natural consequence

2387.52 --> 2391.7599999999998
gyroscopes

2388.48 --> 2394.72
physical ones don't drift

2391.76 --> 2395.3590000000004
because if the earth were a ball then it

2394.72 --> 2399.04
would

2395.359 --> 2403.359
drift as the earth would be changing

2399.04 --> 2406.16
its orientation underneath the gyroscope

2403.359 --> 2406.64
and over time it would drift as the

2406.16 --> 2409.1189999999997
earth

2406.64 --> 2410.0
were spinning underneath it physical

2409.119 --> 2412.079
gyroscopes

2410.0 --> 2413.68
don't drift over time and they don't

2412.079 --> 2417.04
drift over distance

2413.68 --> 2425.839
thus the earth is not a spinning ball

2417.04 --> 2425.839
it's really basic

2436.839 --> 2439.839
hmm

2441.119 --> 2445.52
ah your brain drifts now it's your

2443.359 --> 2453.839
attention that might be drifting

2445.52 --> 2453.839
your brain stays right in place

2462.16 --> 2467.839
you're wrong what serious

2483.04 --> 2486.64
what what did mean every mechanical gyro

2485.359 --> 2488.88
did show drift

2486.64 --> 2488.8799999999997
well

2490.72 --> 2496.16
maybe build one again

2493.76 --> 2498.079
why don't you build another gyroscope

2496.16 --> 2499.52
and another one and another one and then

2498.079 --> 2502.2400000000002
do it all

2499.52 --> 2504.24
do it all again oh it's just the one

2502.24 --> 2505.9199999999996
that's drifting well maybe you built it

2504.24 --> 2509.52
wrong man

2505.92 --> 2510.96
because a well-constructed mechanical

2509.52 --> 2513.7599999999998
gyroscope

2510.96 --> 2514.079
doesn't drift it never does it's not

2513.76 --> 2517.2000000000003
like

2514.079 --> 2519.44
oh well in the last few years earth

2517.2 --> 2521.359
finally started spinning alright because

2519.44 --> 2525.28
mechanical gyroscopes now

2521.359 --> 2528.16
subtly drift no they never do

2525.28 --> 2528.1600000000003
it's ridiculous

2532.319 --> 2535.359
it's serious it would be completely

2534.64 --> 2537.1189999999997
useless

2535.359 --> 2538.72
if they did they would have never been

2537.119 --> 2541.52
used in industry

2538.72 --> 2551.839
if they drifted that's why they use them

2541.52 --> 2551.839
because they don't drift

2560.319 --> 2565.839
this is just getting really silly over

2562.839 --> 2565.839
here

2585.359 --> 2593.839
yeah hello james mason

2607.92 --> 2611.359
in rare form

2611.52 --> 2615.28
what do you mean by that are you saying

2614.88 --> 2618.4
he's

2615.28 --> 2621.3590000000004
actually doing something effectively

2618.4 --> 2621.76
i highly doubt that i haven't heard bob

2621.359 --> 2626.16
say

2621.76 --> 2626.1600000000003
anything interesting in over three years

2627.04 --> 2630.48
it's just recycling old garbage and

2629.44 --> 2635.839
showing a lot of

2630.48 --> 2635.839
very very bad attitude

2636.16 --> 2641.5989999999997
oh you think oh right what i thought

2639.119 --> 2644.8
that being a rare in form is actually

2641.599 --> 2644.8
supposed to be a good thing

2646.48 --> 2650.96
okay you might have misunderstood the uh

2649.359 --> 2653.839
expression

2650.96 --> 2653.839
let me look that up

2658.319 --> 2662.56
extreme otherwise remarkable manner as

2660.64 --> 2666.7999999999997
one the rare form team

2662.56 --> 2666.7999999999997
no yeah being in rare form says here

2674.839 --> 2677.839
remarkable

2683.119 --> 2687.119
okay so it doesn't signify whether it is

2685.839 --> 2690.4
a positive

2687.119 --> 2693.92
or negative

2690.4 --> 2697.119
alteration that's interesting

2693.92 --> 2705.839
so it's kind of a neutral

2697.119 --> 2705.839
remark okay

2709.52 --> 2713.119
right apparently i just looked it up and

2711.839 --> 2714.96
apparently if you are

2713.119 --> 2716.6400000000003
rare in form that doesn't automatically

2714.96 --> 2720.2400000000002
mean you're like

2716.64 --> 2720.8799999999997
in a rare good form or bad form it's

2720.24 --> 2723.1189999999997
just like

2720.88 --> 2725.359
it's unusual so it doesn't even signify

2723.119 --> 2725.359
that

2728.96 --> 2747.839
usually a derogatory form is it

2732.48 --> 2747.839
term i didn't know that i never use it

2753.839 --> 2761.839
what agm how swift he is what

2766.64 --> 2775.839
hey moth eyes oh my god

2779.119 --> 2783.44
dude agm don't even go there man don't

2782.4 --> 2785.76
start doing that

2783.44 --> 2788.88
[ __ ] okay i don't like talking about

2785.76 --> 2793.2000000000003
that even if it was real

2788.88 --> 2793.2000000000003
don't go there never go there

2797.839 --> 2803.7599999999998
and mr lottie take off the freaking mask

2801.28 --> 2817.8390000000004
of your stupid little yellow icon is

2803.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
you're an embarrassment

2819.68 --> 2831.839
a creation bear

2843.119 --> 2859.839
wow lots of people in chat today

2865.28 --> 2870.88
yeah mr lolly look wearing a mask is not

2868.8 --> 2872.0
good for you it's not good for your skin

2870.88 --> 2875.44
it's not good for your

2872.0 --> 2877.92
gums it's not good for your lungs right

2875.44 --> 2880.7200000000003
on top of that with all the [ __ ] coming

2877.92 --> 2884.839
out of your mouth on a regular basis

2880.72 --> 2887.839
that compounds together making it even

2884.839 --> 2887.839
worse

2909.599 --> 2914.079
two more more masks oh my god my god

2912.839 --> 2917.44
don't

2914.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
even joke around with that [ __ ]

2917.44 --> 2929.839
so stupid

2935.359 --> 2943.839
all right

2961.52 --> 2965.68
okay that is kind of funny mr lordy

2967.2 --> 2971.839
stupid but funny

2984.0 --> 2986.48
what

2991.2 --> 2999.839
18 what are you talking about tom parker

2994.48 --> 2999.839
rufus and hubbins

3001.28 --> 3005.2000000000003
are you talking about temperatures or

3003.04 --> 3008.96
something

3005.2 --> 3008.96
using fahrenheit or whatever

3010.319 --> 3017.92
800 oh that's golf talker

3014.72 --> 3017.9199999999996
i don't even know man

3018.079 --> 3024.559
i held a golf stick once

3021.2 --> 3026.64
i don't even remember when i just know i

3024.559 --> 3030.079
held one once

3026.64 --> 3030.64
that's it on the other hand i did do a

3030.079 --> 3033.44
couple of

3030.64 --> 3040.319
miniature golf so as a kid that was kind

3033.44 --> 3043.92
of fun

3040.319 --> 3043.92
on the wii oh my god

3044.19 --> 3047.32
[Music]

3052.839 --> 3061.2799999999997
what seeking star wars really

3057.599 --> 3062.2400000000002
you had to wear a mask while picking out

3061.28 --> 3069.8390000000004
glasses

3062.24 --> 3069.839
oh my god that is so stupid

3107.76 --> 3114.96
okay echo do not

3111.599 --> 3114.96
get a little political there

3119.28 --> 3125.8390000000004
why would you uh specifically prefer

3122.079 --> 3125.8390000000004
that party

3127.359 --> 3134.96
i mean i'm not specifically against

3130.96 --> 3139.599
them but

3134.96 --> 3142.4
i don't know are they really the best

3139.599 --> 3143.6800000000003
and especially let's just imagine they

3142.4 --> 3145.839
get to power

3143.68 --> 3147.839
you really think they're gonna do

3145.839 --> 3153.119
everything they say

3147.839 --> 3155.2799999999997
really in the netherlands

3153.119 --> 3157.52
i don't think political parties have can

3155.28 --> 3159.52
do [ __ ] anymore i think the complete

3157.52 --> 3162.48
political system is a farce

3159.52 --> 3164.16
it should just be moved out of the way

3162.48 --> 3166.72
into the [ __ ]

3164.16 --> 3167.2799999999997
where it belongs because politicians

3166.72 --> 3170.319
can't

3167.28 --> 3170.3190000000004
do [ __ ]

3171.92 --> 3175.119
it's j it's always going to be the same

3174.559 --> 3178.079
freaking

3175.119 --> 3180.319
industrialists that just dictate what

3178.079 --> 3183.52
politicians are going to do

3180.319 --> 3185.44
just like in the united states every

3183.52 --> 3187.44
time somebody gets the power

3185.44 --> 3189.839
in the netherlands oh guess what they're

3187.44 --> 3192.96
not doing what they said they would do

3189.839 --> 3196.72
surprise surprise

3192.96 --> 3199.76
yeah so you really think

3196.72 --> 3203.2
forum for democracy is actually gonna do

3199.76 --> 3203.2000000000003
anything it says it will

3203.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
you think they have the option to

3205.52 --> 3209.839
actually do that

3210.4 --> 3213.839
i mean i'm not fully excluding it who

3213.119 --> 3218.1600000000003
knows man

3213.839 --> 3218.16
it's just that in this age

3219.359 --> 3223.839
i don't know man

3239.76 --> 3243.76
like i think that this sounds really

3241.92 --> 3244.88
ridiculous by the way so don't take this

3243.76 --> 3246.559
literal

3244.88 --> 3248.839
but i think that is if this [ __ ]

3246.559 --> 3251.2000000000003
continues with

3248.839 --> 3251.68
corporatocracy that if the netherlands

3251.2 --> 3254.72
want

3251.68 --> 3255.44
any kind of influence on however things

3254.72 --> 3257.9599999999996
are run

3255.44 --> 3259.839
we're going to have to like kidnap

3257.96 --> 3262.559
industrialist heads

3259.839 --> 3264.0789999999997
to basically just say you are going to

3262.559 --> 3266.48
[ __ ] do this or we're going to

3264.079 --> 3267.119
kill you because otherwise they're not

3266.48 --> 3269.28
going to do

3267.119 --> 3270.319
[ __ ] they're just going to treat us like

3269.28 --> 3272.6400000000003
slaves

3270.319 --> 3273.7599999999998
make promises and then [ __ ] all over

3272.64 --> 3276.0
those promises

3273.76 --> 3277.0400000000004
like they always do because they're a

3276.0 --> 3279.2
bunch of [ __ ]

3277.04 --> 3280.64
fascists control freaks that don't give

3279.2 --> 3284.0
a [ __ ] what people say

3280.64 --> 3286.96
or want they're just gonna do what they

3284.0 --> 3287.599
want oh the the people in control happen

3286.96 --> 3291.04
to be

3287.599 --> 3293.6800000000003
dutch well they don't give a [ __ ] either

3291.04 --> 3296.16
they're just gonna do what they want

3293.68 --> 3296.16
anyway

3304.839 --> 3307.839
right

3323.76 --> 3327.8390000000004
right they do seem to go against the

3325.92 --> 3329.839
establishment oh oh like trump

3327.839 --> 3331.359
went against the establishment as the

3329.839 --> 3334.4
entire establishment kept

3331.359 --> 3338.0789999999997
[ __ ] over him and then he just

3334.4 --> 3340.4
retreated like a little [ __ ]

3338.079 --> 3342.799
literally having a [ __ ] like the

3340.4 --> 3346.319
election stolen from him and retreating

3342.799 --> 3346.319
like a little [ __ ]

3346.72 --> 3349.839
like that

3350.88 --> 3354.88
no it doesn't matter how rebellious they

3354.16 --> 3357.1189999999997
seem

3354.88 --> 3358.0
are they actually gonna do something

3357.119 --> 3360.96
about it

3358.0 --> 3362.24
right that's the real question because

3360.96 --> 3364.079
if they would

3362.24 --> 3365.5989999999997
they would probably have to have like

3364.079 --> 3368.079
constant high

3365.599 --> 3371.52
tier security because there's going to

3368.079 --> 3374.4
be industrial sabotage assassination

3371.52 --> 3376.48
attempts if they would actually do

3374.4 --> 3380.079
something about it right so if it's just

3376.48 --> 3383.359
talk then they're not going to do [ __ ]

3380.079 --> 3385.92
because they're not in control and the

3383.359 --> 3389.44
people aren't in control either

3385.92 --> 3391.6800000000003
mega corporations are in control

3389.44 --> 3392.559
and they're just trying to convince

3391.68 --> 3394.24
everybody to

3392.559 --> 3397.0400000000004
calm the [ __ ] down and just do what

3394.24 --> 3405.839
they're told just [ __ ] off

3397.04 --> 3405.839
yeah that's what's really going on

3416.799 --> 3420.4
now don't be ridiculous minor god that

3419.76 --> 3424.48
you all

3420.4 --> 3427.6800000000003
stop doing that stop stop

3424.48 --> 3430.72
shoving it over the edge every time

3427.68 --> 3433.839
trump is not a demon don't go

3430.72 --> 3434.5589999999997
overboard you do this every time stop

3433.839 --> 3437.7599999999998
doing that

3434.559 --> 3438.44
don't let yourself go overboard don't

3437.76 --> 3442.7990000000004
say

3438.44 --> 3442.799
ridiculously over the top things

3443.119 --> 3447.839
it's not good for you

3448.48 --> 3462.799
that's right

3460.24 --> 3463.52
gonna have hope well if we really want

3462.799 --> 3466.28
to have hope

3463.52 --> 3467.599
then you would have to start at a

3466.28 --> 3470.96
ground-breaking

3467.599 --> 3474.4
grassroots type of movement

3470.96 --> 3478.0
a group that literally ignores politics

3474.4 --> 3482.079
ignores all that [ __ ] and comes with

3478.0 --> 3484.64
practical reforming strategies

3482.079 --> 3485.599
right that's the only thing that can

3484.64 --> 3488.72
actually

3485.599 --> 3491.6800000000003
halfway attempt to change things

3488.72 --> 3492.48
including the control on the long run

3491.68 --> 3494.3999999999996
right

3492.48 --> 3495.92
all those parties to say oh we're gonna

3494.4 --> 3499.2000000000003
do something about this

3495.92 --> 3502.2400000000002
now and just forward this stupid

3499.2 --> 3505.68
boomer mallow we're gonna bring it back

3502.24 --> 3506.319
like that that's always going to fail it

3505.68 --> 3509.2
is

3506.319 --> 3509.839
never possible you understand it is

3509.2 --> 3513.52
never

3509.839 --> 3516.96
possible to do that ever it's physically

3513.52 --> 3518.079
impossible it's a lie it's just boomer

3516.96 --> 3521.44
baiting

3518.079 --> 3523.76
boomer baiting that's what it is

3521.44 --> 3525.04
the parties that do that it's always

3523.76 --> 3528.7990000000004
impossible

3525.04 --> 3532.16
always because it's just not possible

3528.799 --> 3535.28
only way to get out of the situation

3532.16 --> 3538.3999999999996
is to create new

3535.28 --> 3541.599
things grassroots and then

3538.4 --> 3543.6800000000003
make them grow and eventually press all

3541.599 --> 3547.119
the autocratic

3543.68 --> 3550.64
[ __ ] out of the way that's the only

3547.119 --> 3553.04
way can be done

3550.64 --> 3553.839
and i don't think form for democracy is

3553.04 --> 3557.68
a party that

3553.839 --> 3561.92
does that even though i do

3557.68 --> 3561.9199999999996
like it i like their speeches

3562.0 --> 3567.76
i like about that i like him

3565.599 --> 3569.52
it's not perfect but i like him i like

3567.76 --> 3571.599
what he says doesn't mean that i think

3569.52 --> 3574.559
he's actually gonna do that [ __ ]

3571.599 --> 3578.079
but i like how he says it right i'm

3574.559 --> 3578.079
happy that somebody says it

3579.76 --> 3582.88
and there's more people out there in

3581.52 --> 3586.559
politics so there's

3582.88 --> 3590.96
other groups but i'm just currently just

3586.559 --> 3590.96
extremely skeptical about all of them

3592.16 --> 3597.839
hey horishiticho a long time no see

3594.72 --> 3597.839
that's been a long time

3597.92 --> 3602.799
seen you in over two years or something

3603.839 --> 3609.04
huh welcome back

3607.04 --> 3610.5589999999997
right but yeah there's this one party

3609.04 --> 3612.64
that i am or there are a couple of

3610.559 --> 3616.3190000000004
parties that i'm kind of interested in

3612.64 --> 3618.8799999999997
and they were like ultimate niche

3616.319 --> 3620.799
alternatives and they've they've been

3618.88 --> 3624.1600000000003
gaining more ground

3620.799 --> 3627.28
right so for example

3624.16 --> 3628.8799999999997
one of the worst parties now is green

3627.28 --> 3631.92
left

3628.88 --> 3634.559
who was suppo in the 90s they were the

3631.92 --> 3636.48
other they were the niche now they're

3634.559 --> 3640.2400000000002
the absolute

3636.48 --> 3643.44
democratic party level demonic

3640.24 --> 3644.16
scam artist industrialists they are the

3643.44 --> 3648.079
worst

3644.16 --> 3648.799
worst party ever ever well not ever it's

3648.079 --> 3653.52
like

3648.799 --> 3656.96
the main ones are even worse but like

3653.52 --> 3660.96
god green left fell so deep they fell

3656.96 --> 3664.48
so deep so deep such an

3660.96 --> 3667.68
evil conversion it's unbelievable

3664.48 --> 3670.0
so evil right but there's other

3667.68 --> 3671.359
groups now there's the party for animals

3670.0 --> 3673.44
for example

3671.359 --> 3676.0
they are much more they are gaining

3673.44 --> 3678.079
ground like what green left used to be

3676.0 --> 3680.64
that party is kind of taking over that

3678.079 --> 3683.52
role on the long run risk the same

3680.64 --> 3684.0
you get it they risk the same it's a

3683.52 --> 3686.319
sliding

3684.0 --> 3687.04
skill and there's other groups there's

3686.319 --> 3690.64
groups like

3687.04 --> 3692.4
think or dink

3690.64 --> 3694.72
i don't know too much about them but

3692.4 --> 3697.28
i've heard good things and people that i

3694.72 --> 3698.0
really really respect say it's a good

3697.28 --> 3700.2400000000002
party

3698.0 --> 3702.079
that's about as far as it goes for my

3700.24 --> 3704.0789999999997
information on them

3702.079 --> 3705.92
so there and then of course there's the

3704.079 --> 3709.28
older the pirate party

3705.92 --> 3710.799
very much focused on freedom of

3709.28 --> 3713.8390000000004
information especially

3710.799 --> 3714.96
and the internet also cannabis

3713.839 --> 3717.44
legalization was

3714.96 --> 3720.16
the theme in there that's continuing all

3717.44 --> 3723.52
that like i like that party

3720.16 --> 3727.839
for yeah for a variety of reasons

3723.52 --> 3727.839
now do i fully trust them

3729.039 --> 3734.96
i don't know man i've like

3732.64 --> 3737.2799999999997
hung around with some of those people

3734.96 --> 3739.359
that are in there it's

3737.28 --> 3741.3590000000004
they seem very vulnerable to like

3739.359 --> 3744.5589999999997
corporatist invasion

3741.359 --> 3747.2799999999997
so i don't know how stable it is but

3744.559 --> 3748.88
the movement is good the people that

3747.28 --> 3750.96
typically

3748.88 --> 3754.88
get in there are in a bit like

3750.96 --> 3758.319
disgruntled leftists leftists that don't

3754.88 --> 3760.2400000000002
want the freaking communism

3758.319 --> 3762.5589999999997
right that's what i like about that

3760.24 --> 3762.5589999999997
party

3763.44 --> 3767.44
right but the pirate party is

3765.039 --> 3769.6400000000003
pro-globalism that's right

3767.44 --> 3770.96
but you see there's like this

3769.64 --> 3774.319
complicated

3770.96 --> 3777.44
issue with that because what they want

3774.319 --> 3779.68
is a non-autocratic form of globalism

3777.44 --> 3783.2000000000003
they want actually a decentralized

3779.68 --> 3787.0389999999998
democratic form of globalism

3783.2 --> 3790.799
right so it's complicated

3787.039 --> 3793.44
it is just complicated and they have

3790.799 --> 3797.7599999999998
formulated for themselves a strategy

3793.44 --> 3800.88
that indeed requires globalism

3797.76 --> 3804.079
that's right so they're not perfect see

3800.88 --> 3804.079
see see what i mean

3804.64 --> 3809.359
it's it's just freaking complicated man

3807.2 --> 3811.839
like i'm not gonna give you political

3809.359 --> 3811.839
advice

3812.799 --> 3817.0389999999998
i'm just saying forum for democracy i

3815.039 --> 3819.44
love the way they talk

3817.039 --> 3821.119
but i don't know if they can actually

3819.44 --> 3823.2000000000003
walk the walk

3821.119 --> 3824.799
if they can not if they want to or plan

3823.2 --> 3827.359
to but if they actually can

3824.799 --> 3827.359
i don't know

3828.0 --> 3835.28
maybe we'll find out

3831.039 --> 3835.28
so at this time i am kind of

3835.359 --> 3841.119
in my mind not in my actions yet putting

3838.16 --> 3844.72
my bet on think

3841.119 --> 3848.4
it's very i like the name too

3844.72 --> 3852.0
that one is like seems the least harmful

3848.4 --> 3854.559
at this time they're very much

3852.0 --> 3856.319
about information being on top of

3854.559 --> 3859.8390000000004
information and research

3856.319 --> 3859.839
in all directions i like that

3863.2 --> 3881.839
there is no flat earth party in the

3866.48 --> 3881.839
front so that's stupid

3891.039 --> 3895.44
can you imagine a flat earth party lit

3894.0 --> 3897.839
do you know what that would be like

3895.44 --> 3898.559
they would become the lightning raw

3897.839 --> 3901.68
party

3898.559 --> 3903.6800000000003
i'll bet though that forum for democracy

3901.68 --> 3904.72
and what is it the haird wilder's party

3903.68 --> 3907.52
would love it

3904.72 --> 3908.0789999999997
because suddenly everybody be like well

3907.52 --> 3912.24
at least

3908.079 --> 3912.2400000000002
you're not the flat earth party

3912.559 --> 3925.52
you know what i mean

3922.799 --> 3927.2
no that that just seems really silly but

3925.52 --> 3928.0
who knows man maybe in the future

3927.2 --> 3930.48
something

3928.0 --> 3930.48
i don't know

3934.48 --> 3938.16
let's get through the

3938.48 --> 3946.72
global corona genocide situations first

3942.64 --> 3946.72
and then we'll see what what can be done

3948.839 --> 3956.64
after

3951.839 --> 3956.64
dank is islamic really is it

3959.119 --> 3968.4
is it where are you getting that

3965.599 --> 3968.4
i didn't know that

3977.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
i'm gonna have to look that one up

4007.119 --> 4021.839
oh [ __ ] really

4022.319 --> 4024.64
huh

4025.839 --> 4028.88

4110.56 --> 4115.279
gonna happen

4111.52 --> 4119.839000000001
it's not gonna be very effective okay

4115.279 --> 4121.4400000000005
it just ugh

4119.839 --> 4133.839
god it's giving me a headache just

4121.44 --> 4133.839
thinking about it

4137.04 --> 4140.96
there's a lot you don't know irwin you

4139.199 --> 4141.44
agree to think you know oh are you

4140.96 --> 4145.12

smart ass i'm sorry i didn't know all

4148.96 --> 4156.319
the details about the political parties

4152.56 --> 4158.839000000001
in my country yeah i'm so ashamed

4156.319 --> 4163.279
that i didn't know everything about

4158.839 --> 4163.2789999999995
politics in my little country

4173.6 --> 4178.159000000001

4221.6 --> 4231.84
all right

4232.8 --> 4245.84
uh yeah tmi hurry

4235.84 --> 4245.84
don't go there

4269.6 --> 4288.719
green tea always is easy

4286.8 --> 4290.320000000001
no indifference are getting banned for

4288.719 --> 4291.92
your bad attitude and not

4290.32 --> 4293.92
answering the question and then

4291.92 --> 4296.159
continuing the bad attitude how about

4293.92 --> 4296.159
that

4296.719 --> 4300.0
yeah your stupid little red herring

4298.719 --> 4301.92
question to try and get away

4300.0 --> 4303.12
from the situation is not going to save

4301.92 --> 4305.92
you

4303.12 --> 4308.0
and also it's not important yeah it's

4305.92 --> 4310.719
irrelevant

4308.0 --> 4311.44
yeah your stupid buoyancy formula yeah i

4310.719 --> 4314.64
know it's

4311.44 --> 4318.159
it's based on gravity yeah

4314.64 --> 4319.679
there's no proof for gravity though and

4318.159 --> 4322.719
we got a better system it's called

4319.679 --> 4322.719
relative density

4323.36 --> 4329.839999999999
what bad attitude oh well if you even

4325.44 --> 4329.839999999999
have to ask maybe i should just ban you

4339.12 --> 4345.84
red herring questions yeah

4342.32 --> 4347.599999999999
that's a bad attitude quickly moving on

4345.84 --> 4349.92
to another question

4347.6 --> 4350.64
to avoid the calamity that you were

4349.92 --> 4357.84
getting into

4350.64 --> 4357.84
yeah that's a bad attitude

4368.84 --> 4373.679
so

4370.239 --> 4373.678999999999
liked well fe

4374.96 --> 4381.52
is not a an animate thing

4378.239 --> 4384.159
that has feelings that likes things

4381.52 --> 4385.4400000000005
right but when it comes to actual

4384.159 --> 4388.08
evidence

4385.44 --> 4399.839999999999
scientific evidence then calculations

4388.08 --> 4399.84
don't cut it that's right

4417.12 --> 4422.239
oh my god james mason i i hope not it's

4420.64 --> 4424.2390000000005
one of the dumbest things i've ever

4422.239 --> 4427.36
heard

4424.239 --> 4430.718999999999
seriously that concept is literally

4427.36 --> 4433.199
as dumb on the same level of stupid

4430.719 --> 4441.84
as the supposed cavendish experiment

4433.199 --> 4441.839999999999
it's that level of stupid

4442.0 --> 4455.84
no hurry i didn't see that

4467.84 --> 4469.92
you

4491.04 --> 4497.84
fusion what

4499.679 --> 4504.4
well yeah fusion maybe

4505.44 --> 4511.839999999999
so that doesn't really seem like a

4507.28 --> 4511.84
natural phenomenon though

4536.08 --> 4539.84
okay hurry that sounds weird

4567.6 --> 4569.92
hmm

4573.84 --> 4578.159000000001
right george sanford well that should

4576.4 --> 4580.96
work on plasma then

4578.159 --> 4583.36
because air is not susceptible to

4580.96 --> 4585.52
magnetism

4583.36 --> 4587.92
so yeah sure they can use magnetic

4585.52 --> 4590.64
barriers to keep the plasma in and

4587.92 --> 4592.0
prevent it from going in all directions

4590.64 --> 4594.0
but that's not going to work on

4592.0 --> 4609.84
air though air is just still gonna

4594.0 --> 4609.84
freely move right through that

4611.12 --> 4615.04
interesting though i didn't know there

4612.56 --> 4623.84
even was such a thing

4615.04 --> 4623.84
fusion reactor

4633.84 --> 4651.84
all right i'll be back in two minutes

4788.08 --> 4805.84
yeah neil cosentino jibby jedi died dude

4791.36 --> 4805.839999999999
he died it's like months ago

4806.719 --> 4819.84
i don't know how i just know he did

4842.639 --> 4849.04
they say they booted him oh

4846.719 --> 4849.04
okay

4853.44 --> 4859.599999999999
no they said whatever dude whatever

4856.56 --> 4863.04
i was totally freaking died oh so just

4859.6 --> 4865.4400000000005
yeah don't ask me dude

4863.04 --> 4866.639
why the [ __ ] would you even assume that

4865.44 --> 4870.48
i know

4866.639 --> 4873.4400000000005
me of all people crying out loud

4870.48 --> 4875.04
i'm not a social expert i don't know

4873.44 --> 4878.239
anybody

4875.04 --> 4881.28
i literally don't know [ __ ] about people

4878.239 --> 4882.718999999999
out there i know about people i deal

4881.28 --> 4885.599999999999
with i know about

4882.719 --> 4886.4800000000005
quick on the spot analysis i don't know

4885.6 --> 4888.639
people

4886.48 --> 4890.239
i don't even know people's names for

4888.639 --> 4903.84
crying out loud why

4890.239 --> 4903.839999999999
ask me i don't know anybody

4914.84 --> 4917.84
okay

4918.56 --> 4922.320000000001
why would you assume that because i go

4921.199 --> 4926.159
on there i know

4922.32 --> 4928.84
anybody there i go as far as to

4926.159 --> 4930.32
recognize people's voices and their

4928.84 --> 4933.4400000000005
characteristics that's

4930.32 --> 4936.96
it that's

4933.44 --> 4939.44
it that's it that will always be it

4936.96 --> 4940.2390000000005
even 20 years later if i did it every

4939.44 --> 4943.5199999999995
day that's

4940.239 --> 4946.5599999999995
it you get it i don't memorize people

4943.52 --> 4948.159000000001
i don't memorize people's names the

4946.56 --> 4953.280000000001
amount of people i can even

4948.159 --> 4953.28
coherently remember is like 20.

4953.76 --> 4973.84
also i don't give a [ __ ]

4958.48 --> 4973.839999999999
it's not my talent

4977.44 --> 4982.4
i will yell at you you yell at everybody

4980.4 --> 4984.239
all the time

4982.4 --> 4985.599999999999
especially when nathan rounds out the

4984.239 --> 4990.239
show

4985.6 --> 4990.2390000000005
so i damn well will yet let yell at you

what is it a super high profile person

5026.159 --> 5030.4
that's been around

5027.199 --> 5032.879999999999
like famously for five years yeah

5030.4 --> 5035.679
there's a chance i might know them

5032.88 --> 5036.159000000001
are they anything other than that don't

5035.679 --> 5038.96

so shout out to adam meekin indeed

5147.92 --> 5155.84
no my god no

5156.0 --> 5159.92
flat earth is just going to be flat

5158.0 --> 5162.4
earth it's not gonna flourish

5159.92 --> 5163.4400000000005
it's never gonna go mainstream it's

5162.4 --> 5166.799999999999
never gonna go

5163.44 --> 5171.28
uncensored you understand never

5166.8 --> 5175.4400000000005
never never never never

5171.28 --> 5178.88
never it can't die out

5175.44 --> 5180.4
because oh people get tied up whatever

5178.88 --> 5182.2390000000005
they're just gonna find some new

5180.4 --> 5182.879999999999
platform do it all over again the more

5182.239 --> 5186.4
you

5182.88 --> 5187.12
censor it like really actively crack

5186.4 --> 5189.44
down on it

5187.12 --> 5191.36
it's just gonna get resilient and find a

5189.44 --> 5194.638999999999
way back

5191.36 --> 5196.88
so it's never gonna die out either it's

5194.639 --> 5197.679
never gonna go mainstream do you

5196.88 --> 5200.8
understand

5197.679 --> 5205.1990000000005
ever you will never get the big numbers

5200.8 --> 5206.08
ever ever don't even [ __ ] fantasize

5205.199 --> 5209.599999999999
about it it's

5206.08 --> 5210.0
really dumb it's like fantasizing that

5209.6 --> 5213.679
one day

5210.0 --> 5215.92
you will be king it's stupid don't do it

5213.679 --> 5217.679
ever it's never going to happen it's

5215.92 --> 5219.36
always going to be at the bottom of

5217.679 --> 5220.0
things it's always going to be snowed

5219.36 --> 5223.04
under

5220.0 --> 5225.44
corporatist financed but

5223.04 --> 5226.96
riddled big channels that talk about

5225.44 --> 5231.36
[ __ ]

5226.96 --> 5235.44
yeah always always always forever

5231.36 --> 5237.679
it will never get above that

5235.44 --> 5238.719
but it can never be erased either

5237.679 --> 5241.52
because people do

5238.719 --> 5243.28
catch on people do get inspired people

5241.52 --> 5245.280000000001
do start to do their own thing and if

5243.28 --> 5248.159
you completely remove them they'll just

5245.28 --> 5250.239
find another place to do it

5248.159 --> 5253.5199999999995
and the more you push them the harder

5250.239 --> 5267.599999999999
they're going to make effort

5253.52 --> 5270.4800000000005
and it's going to stay like that

5267.6 --> 5271.679
now why don't you ask again rufus ain't

5270.48 --> 5276.638999999999
hubbins i only

5271.679 --> 5276.639
literally just addressed it five seconds

5278.84 --> 5281.84
ago

5296.48 --> 5304.48
we on netflix who what among the

5300.4 --> 5309.12
hundreds of thousands of other [ __ ]

5304.48 --> 5309.759999999999
series movies right yeah i'm pretty sure

5309.12 --> 5312.5599999999995
we're still

5309.76 --> 5314.159000000001
outnumbered by like pro pedophilia

5312.56 --> 5317.120000000001
propaganda pieces

5314.159 --> 5318.159
numerically mind god so that's not

5317.12 --> 5321.84
saying much

5318.159 --> 5323.599999999999
yeah what do you think you're special

5321.84 --> 5324.4800000000005
because there's a movie that somebody's

5323.6 --> 5326.320000000001
heard of that

5324.48 --> 5327.599999999999
that talks about flat earth in a

5326.32 --> 5337.84
ridiculing way

5327.6 --> 5337.84
mind you no

5363.44 --> 5370.0
i what neil and arwen i will get you

5367.6 --> 5371.84
in a few minutes when you join flat

5370.0 --> 5373.76
earth of its buddy

5371.84 --> 5375.360000000001
all right you're gonna go over to there

5373.76 --> 5379.84
sure

5375.36 --> 5379.839999999999
i'll see you later

5396.719 --> 5400.88
rufus and hubbins the truth is already

5399.679 --> 5403.52
impossible to hide

5400.88 --> 5405.1990000000005
it's literally impossible to hide that's

5403.52 --> 5408.080000000001
not the issue

5405.199 --> 5409.919999999999
the issue is is that people have been

5408.08 --> 5411.32
conditioned and brainwashed over the

5409.92 --> 5414.28
ages in an

5411.32 --> 5418.239
increasingly aggressive

5414.28 --> 5421.88
self-containing fashion that people

5418.239 --> 5424.718999999999
don't care about it anymore or will

5421.88 --> 5426.08
strategically compartmentalize it out of

5424.719 --> 5428.8
the way

5426.08 --> 5430.96
that's the problem problem is not that

5428.8 --> 5432.639
the truth is not there available for

5430.96 --> 5435.28
somebody to pick up on

5432.639 --> 5436.719
the problem is that people are unwilling

5435.28 --> 5439.199
to take it

5436.719 --> 5440.32
that's the freaking problem and that's

5439.199 --> 5443.28
why there's now

5440.32 --> 5444.719
a genocide commencing of people

5443.28 --> 5447.759999999999
literally

5444.719 --> 5451.04
dying dying

5447.76 --> 5454.0
for their stupid doubling down beliefs

5451.04 --> 5454.679
right that's the issue because people

5454.0 --> 5457.679
are

5454.679 --> 5461.4400000000005
unwilling to learn

5457.679 --> 5463.6
the truth that's the problem it's not

5461.44 --> 5465.36
that the truth is not readily available

5463.6 --> 5468.8
the problem is is that people don't

5465.36 --> 5477.679
want it they'd rather die

5468.8 --> 5481.679
for their stupid little dream

5477.679 --> 5481.679
yeah you tiny wumbo

5483.12 --> 5486.5599999999995
because you're gonna take it like a

5485.04 --> 5490.639
stupid little idiot

5486.56 --> 5492.8
and you're gonna die and then when i

5490.639 --> 5495.92
notice you don't show up in chat anymore

5492.8 --> 5500.0
i'm gonna say it yeah stupid guy

5495.92 --> 5505.84
died for his belief i hope god shows

5500.0 --> 5505.84
mercy on him

5544.639 --> 5551.04
it's really mine to god

5548.159 --> 5551.04
think it's funny

5553.28 --> 5555.599999999999
dude

5558.0 --> 5562.48
you think i think it's funny that people

5560.639 --> 5564.639
are literally killing themselves for

5562.48 --> 5566.32
their belief you think that's amusing to

5564.639 --> 5569.36
me

5566.32 --> 5572.08
it's the biggest tragedy ever

5569.36 --> 5574.5599999999995
people's stupidity got to them when if

5572.08 --> 5576.639
they hadn't let that happen

5574.56 --> 5578.96
they might have actually become a really

5576.639 --> 5582.08
awesome unique individualist

5578.96 --> 5584.2390000000005
person persons

5582.08 --> 5586.639
that would have contributed to the world

5584.239 --> 5588.959999999999
and made it a better place but instead

5586.639 --> 5589.84
they caught up in their conditioning and

5588.96 --> 5592.2390000000005
now they're gonna

5589.84 --> 5593.84
die for their stupid little dream that

5592.239 --> 5596.879999999999
they can't let go of

5593.84 --> 5598.4800000000005
yeah that's not freaking amusing or

5596.88 --> 5602.2390000000005
laughter worthy to me

5598.48 --> 5603.599999999999
at all it's horrific it's a freaking

5602.239 --> 5617.839999999999
holocaust

5603.6 --> 5617.84
it's not funny mind a god

5628.84 --> 5631.84
uh

5639.679 --> 5642.96
you know ballers being stupid and double

5642.0 --> 5644.88
thinking and

5642.96 --> 5647.199
sniveling and stuttering yeah that's

5644.88 --> 5649.36
funny i get that that's part is funny

5647.199 --> 5652.799999999999
yeah

5649.36 --> 5656.5599999999995
people dying because they refuse

5652.8 --> 5660.08
to inform themselves it's not funny

5656.56 --> 5663.360000000001
is no way that is ever funny to

5660.08 --> 5665.92
anybody but a pureborn psychopath you

5663.36 --> 5665.92
understand

5666.96 --> 5673.84
pay attention to what comes out of your

5668.719 --> 5673.84
mouth buddy

5684.84 --> 5687.84
up

5709.119 --> 5715.839999999999
oh that's good to know indifference

5726.84 --> 5729.84
uh

5734.6 --> 5738.400000000001
anti-vaxxors will be the real new world

5736.96 --> 5741.52
lawyer well they will be

5738.4 --> 5745.839999999999
the only remnant left of in

5741.52 --> 5749.679
yeah of structurally in in

5745.84 --> 5749.679
[ __ ] what's the word for that

5750.8 --> 5755.04
that will have it resemble any kind of

5752.96 --> 5758.2390000000005
genetic integrity

5755.04 --> 5760.96
right anti-vaxxers will be the only

5758.239 --> 5761.599999999999
bunch of people left that will resemble

5760.96 --> 5764.4
resemble

5761.6 --> 5765.84
any durable kind of genetic integrity

5764.4 --> 5769.28
because the rest is going to be so

5765.84 --> 5772.639
[ __ ] up it's literally going to

5769.28 --> 5776.0
destroy humanity's gene pool right

5772.639 --> 5777.76
make it unable to continue procreating

5776.0 --> 5779.199
over the generations yeah that's what

5777.76 --> 5780.719
this [ __ ] is doing

5779.199 --> 5782.799999999999
because all these [ __ ] people

5780.719 --> 5786.56
indoctrinated with their stupid

5782.8 --> 5786.56
anti-human propaganda

5790.08 --> 5796.88
so yeah human beings

5793.119 --> 5799.239
bad for mother earth you have to help

5796.88 --> 5800.400000000001
against climate change against

5799.239 --> 5803.599999999999
overpopulation

5800.4 --> 5804.719
yet you're literally exterminating your

5803.6 --> 5813.84
own race you

5804.719 --> 5813.84
[ __ ] freaks you demons

5814.88 --> 5819.36
guess what's gonna happen how how well

5817.92 --> 5822.56
do you think

5819.36 --> 5825.44
the nature of this world is gonna do

5822.56 --> 5826.320000000001
when humans are not around why do you

5825.44 --> 5829.678999999999
think nature

5826.32 --> 5833.5199999999995
in many places is beautiful because

5829.679 --> 5838.96
people took care of it yeah

5833.52 --> 5842.159000000001
completely wild nature is not pleasant

5838.96 --> 5847.84
it's not good it's wild it's

5842.159 --> 5847.839999999999
raw it's unpredictable it's dangerous

5848.639 --> 5856.2390000000005
people are the caretakers

5851.92 --> 5857.76
of this realm without humans it's just

5856.239 --> 5860.638999999999
gonna be a wild

5857.76 --> 5860.639
heap of trash

5860.8 --> 5865.28
it's more likelihood species are gonna

5862.88 --> 5869.6
die out without humans

5865.28 --> 5872.4
on the long run you understand

5869.6 --> 5874.08
no they don't care no they just want to

5872.4 --> 5878.159
cry out and just see

5874.08 --> 5881.28
yay everybody's getting exterminated

5878.159 --> 5886.08
oh my god now i can imagine during my

5881.28 --> 5887.92
death as i slide into hell that oh yeah

5886.08 --> 5890.989
this is better for the earth

5887.92 --> 5890.9890000000005
[Music]

5898.8 --> 5903.119000000001
yeah any francis no no it that that's

5901.52 --> 5906.719
the thing

5903.119 --> 5910.32
the killing people aspect part

5906.719 --> 5913.119
is only the bonus that's the little

5910.32 --> 5914.08
extra bonus moment for bill gates who

5913.119 --> 5917.5199999999995
loves that

5914.08 --> 5920.96
because he would prefer to see people

5917.52 --> 5923.52
die within his lifetime and not just

5920.96 --> 5924.32
learn to live with knowing that he

5923.52 --> 5927.360000000001
basically

5924.32 --> 5929.759999999999
exterminated a big part of the

5927.36 --> 5931.119
human genetic pool on the long run

5929.76 --> 5935.4400000000005
outside of his life

5931.119 --> 5939.36
he wants to see them die now

5935.44 --> 5942.159
super painful yeah remember the glee

5939.36 --> 5942.159
when he said that

5942.32 --> 5948.4
yeah he wants to see them die now so

5945.44 --> 5951.5199999999995
that's why they put a little extra

5948.4 --> 5952.96
right but it's it's genetically altering

5951.52 --> 5956.96
you irreversibly

5952.96 --> 5956.96
it's damaging the gene pool

5994.639 --> 5998.400000000001
yeah you don't know [ __ ] about nature

5997.92 --> 6002.32
you have

5998.4 --> 6003.199
dumbass ja ja light brother nature will

6002.32 --> 6007.679
do well without you

6003.199 --> 6008.48
you're a [ __ ] a [ __ ] 200 years

6007.679 --> 6011.36
outdated

6008.48 --> 6014.0
nature religion [ __ ] you don't know

6011.36 --> 6017.28
[ __ ] about the physical reality

6014.0 --> 6019.36
yeah that people is gonna go to [ __ ]

6017.28 --> 6024.48
who's gonna put out the fire

6019.36 --> 6024.48
who's gonna put out the fires yeah

6025.92 --> 6033.52
stupid dumbasses you don't know [ __ ]

6029.36 --> 6036.32
about nature yeah

6033.52 --> 6037.6
nature's been better than ever because

6036.32 --> 6040.96
of humans

6037.6 --> 6043.679
the only real tragedies that come are

6040.96 --> 6045.199
when humans decide to basically ruin an

6043.679 --> 6047.76
entire region for some

6045.199 --> 6048.799999999999
industrial exploit yeah that is that is

6047.76 --> 6051.4400000000005
sad

6048.8 --> 6053.4400000000005
that's sad when that happens yeah but at

6051.44 --> 6057.28
the same time we maintain it

6053.44 --> 6060.48
all you get it no more humans

6057.28 --> 6060.48
no more maintenance

6060.88 --> 6065.84
it's going to be a wild wasteland

6085.92 --> 6089.28
now in defense humanity is not the real

6088.08 --> 6093.119
virus

6089.28 --> 6096.239
satan is the virus satan

6093.119 --> 6099.5199999999995
the mind killer the willing

6096.239 --> 6103.839999999999
stupid short-sighted little slave

6099.52 --> 6107.52
[ __ ] mindset is the virus

6103.84 --> 6110.2390000000005
yeah not humanity

6107.52 --> 6112.080000000001
it's the autopilot it's stupid it's

6110.239 --> 6114.48
culture of stupid

6112.08 --> 6115.76
it's cowardice it's the willingness to

6114.48 --> 6118.799999999999
give up

6115.76 --> 6122.639
willingness to be short-sighted

6118.8 --> 6135.84
yeah that's the virus not humanity

6122.639 --> 6135.84
it's a cultural plague

6146.84 --> 6149.84
um

6155.679 --> 6163.84
shut up bloody dumbass

6184.639 --> 6190.0
yeah it is commenter mr commenter mech

6187.679 --> 6192.4
commenter whatever stupid sock troll

6190.0 --> 6193.28
the earth is [ __ ] flat you hear it's

6192.4 --> 6195.92
flat

6193.28 --> 6197.92
there's no curvature we can see too far

6195.92 --> 6200.159
at too low observation height

6197.92 --> 6202.32
there is no optics effects that allow

6200.159 --> 6205.839999999999
this effect to happen

6202.32 --> 6205.84
on a spherical geometry

6206.0 --> 6214.4
yeah earth is flat flat as [ __ ]

6210.48 --> 6214.4
and there's nothing you can do about it

6215.199 --> 6233.839999999999
it's never going to be anything other

6217.28 --> 6233.84
than flat

6238.96 --> 6247.84
get the [ __ ] out [ __ ]

6252.88 --> 6257.36
did he actually literally say that

6255.119 --> 6259.599999999999
that's hilarious

6257.36 --> 6261.839999999999
earth is incredibly flat when did he say

6259.6 --> 6261.84
that

6263.92 --> 6267.52
he might be incredibly he might have

6265.84 --> 6269.76
meant incredibly flat

6267.52 --> 6274.56
looking though and then might have had

6269.76 --> 6289.84
that last word cut off i don't think he

6274.56 --> 6289.84
would ever consciously say that

6291.119 --> 6298.239
no that's not the bottom line jaja light

6294.88 --> 6299.679
human being is intelligence no it's the

6298.239 --> 6301.638999999999
greed

6299.679 --> 6303.6
it's the giving no shits it's

6301.639 --> 6306.32
desperation

6303.6 --> 6310.0
it's pettiness that's what destroy

6306.32 --> 6313.679
that's what actually destroys nature

6310.0 --> 6317.76
right humans have actually devised

6313.679 --> 6321.6
how to breed fertile growing grounds

6317.76 --> 6326.320000000001
yeah how to create effective like

6321.6 --> 6329.4400000000005
forest ground yeah that's what we made

6326.32 --> 6330.239
yeah we can now make that [ __ ] implanted

6329.44 --> 6332.5599999999995
somewhere

6330.239 --> 6334.4
where there was nothing and then it will

6332.56 --> 6337.679
thrive yeah you get it

6334.4 --> 6338.719
nature doesn't do that on its own we did

6337.679 --> 6342.0
that

6338.719 --> 6344.8
we can do that yeah humans don't only

6342.0 --> 6346.88
destroy you stupid squirter

6344.8 --> 6348.2390000000005
maybe you should listen to the climate

6346.88 --> 6350.0
change propaganda

6348.239 --> 6359.839999999999
telling you to freaking kill yourself

6350.0 --> 6359.84
maybe you should stop listening to that

6368.48 --> 6372.879999999999
dude you don't even know what that is

6370.84 --> 6376.159000000001
dude

6372.88 --> 6378.88
the lungs of the world which lungs

6376.159 --> 6380.96
i'm breathing buddy which lungs are

6378.88 --> 6385.119
destroyed exactly

6380.96 --> 6389.36
oh you mean a claim was laid

6385.119 --> 6393.5199999999995
that it was the lungs and then it was

6389.36 --> 6396.719
claimed it's being destroyed right

6393.52 --> 6400.400000000001
oh yeah 70 acres of forest each day and

6396.719 --> 6403.36
how many acres of forest grows back

6400.4 --> 6404.4
every day indifference oh you don't

6403.36 --> 6407.759999999999
think about that

6404.4 --> 6412.0
yeah that's because you sucked

6407.76 --> 6412.8
up the propaganda humans only destroyed

6412.0 --> 6415.76
your winter

6412.8 --> 6417.52
yeah yeah that's propaganda yeah take

6415.76 --> 6419.6
