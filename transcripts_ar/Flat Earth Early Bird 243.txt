[Music]

38.05 --> 46.789
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.809 --> 50.42
early-bird number 243 and I see that my

46.789 --> 54.229
volume is low again this is really

50.42 --> 58.61
aggravating it seems like my volume

54.229 --> 61.04
seems to change every time I start

58.61 --> 63.92
hanging I start up OBS again it's really

61.04 --> 66.8
aggravating anyway AB welcome to flatter

63.92 --> 69.02
the earlybird 243 I'm your host

66.8 --> 70.7
Arwen and before we start to show please

69.02 --> 72.8
don't forget to share it on any platform

70.7 --> 74.99000000000001
you deem fit and if you haven't already

72.8 --> 76.55
subscribed to my channel and hit the

74.99 --> 78.229
bell notification so you know when I'm

76.55 --> 80.99
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

78.229 --> 82.429
Amsterdam time every day also please

80.99 --> 85.22
support my channel through the Super

82.429 --> 87.44
chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe

85.22 --> 94.97
would much obliged

87.44 --> 97.07
so yeah hello the weather today yeah

94.97 --> 99.28999999999999
it's a little better than was yesterday

97.07 --> 103.49
but it was still rainy you can see that

99.29 --> 105.56
the dark clouds but right now it seems

103.49 --> 108.58999999999999
to be dry for a bit it's still kind of

105.56 --> 109.61
warm it's not that cold but as I went

108.59 --> 112.7
for groceries

109.61 --> 115.64
I went also yeah I got wet but it seemed

112.7 --> 118.46000000000001
that in like the last half hour already

115.64 --> 122.03
dried up so yeah I got a weird start of

118.46 --> 124.52
the day today I got up pretty early as I

122.03 --> 126.59
went to bed pretty early oh by the way I

124.52 --> 133.04
have tumeric I have a lot today

126.59 --> 137.93
Tamera coffee tea I got an apple and I

133.04 --> 140.17999999999998
got a banana and I got lemonade so yeah

137.93 --> 142.489
I got all this stuff and more that I'm

140.18 --> 144.38
not gonna definitely not gonna eat that

142.489 --> 147.47
I thought was gonna be for this

144.38 --> 151.85
afternoon because I was reminded this

147.47 --> 156.829
morning as I was saying yeah by one of

151.85 --> 159.68
my gamers like yeah tomorrow afternoon

156.829 --> 161.9
at half past two there's gonna be the

159.68 --> 163.06900000000002
game can you be there so I was like oh

161.9 --> 165.65
[ __ ]

163.069 --> 168.23
forgotten it was this Saturday so I went

165.65 --> 171.31900000000002
for groceries got all this stuff then I

168.23 --> 173.78
came back and right as I came back he

171.319 --> 176.81
called said yeah there was an emergency

173.78 --> 181.069
at work with the gamemaster so it's

176.81 --> 184.93
awful so typical but anyway that means

181.069 --> 192.01
that yeah at least I can have a show so

184.93 --> 196.989
every disadvantage hazard advantage hmm

192.01 --> 200.54
so a lot has happened again

196.989 --> 204.14000000000001
pretty incredible I did join the debates

200.54 --> 208.63
after all yesterday but then eventually

204.14 --> 211.42999999999998
I went out on a lunch I kind of dropped

208.63 --> 213.98
when I came back and I saw a quantum

211.43 --> 214.43
eraser was in and he was just doing his

213.98 --> 218.89999999999998
thing

214.43 --> 223.33
I didn't even yeah I just left didn't

218.9 --> 226.43
feel like it also weird there auntie

223.33 --> 229.549
round table yeah he announced it on my

226.43 --> 232.16
channel but it was canceled and still

229.549 --> 236.0
unclear to me what exactly happened

232.16 --> 238.69
haven't heard from Randy since that so I

236.0 --> 243.17
don't know what's going on exactly but

238.69 --> 245.84
it was said that Brenda didn't report in

243.17 --> 247.80999999999997
time didn't I don't know I get the

245.84 --> 250.66
feeling she didn't hand in a

247.81 --> 255.859
pre-recorded presentation which is the

250.66 --> 258.079
requirement for his show format didn't

255.859 --> 263.24
get any confirmation of that though but

258.079 --> 268.1
that is what I suspect and yeah I don't

263.24 --> 273.08
know we'll see what happens next but

268.1 --> 277.94
yeah in the meantime Dejan seems to be

273.08 --> 280.46
also definitely on the side of doubting

277.94 --> 282.46999999999997
quantum mechanics and he forwarded me

280.46 --> 287.15
today a video that I did post in chat

282.47 --> 289.31
also something that argues why light is

287.15 --> 291.2
not a particle and it is actually it's

289.31 --> 293.06
amazing because this is a person

291.2 --> 295.52
obviously knowing what they're talking

293.06 --> 298.789
about and a lot of what he says

295.52 --> 302.539
is kind of my argument except that he

298.789 --> 306.05
claims the wave and I don't see the

302.539 --> 308.479
necessity of a wave I think it's a beam

306.05 --> 311.05
but other than that it was pretty much

308.479 --> 311.05
spot-on

311.62 --> 316.97
except maybe for the the concept of

315.11 --> 319.97
delay in the first place because I

316.97 --> 321.56
simply think that speed does not really

319.97 --> 324.74
have a light hell doesn't really have a

321.56 --> 329.68
speed but that there are frequency

324.74 --> 334.909
effects that have mistakenly been

329.68 --> 338.27
interpreted as speed delay and if you

334.909 --> 341.15
unravel that then instantaneous light

338.27 --> 345.65
beam connection really makes a lot of

341.15 --> 350.78
sense does to me hello James Mason are

345.65 --> 353.10999999999996
we are we okay yeah let's see you is a

350.78 --> 353.10999999999996
chat

358.97 --> 365.39000000000004
all right so yeah Steve and aham and

363.02 --> 368.87
gaining wisdom stone monkey 3d came in

365.39 --> 370.52
early then I said it was off then I

368.87 --> 376.28000000000003
haven't heard for a while then later

370.52 --> 381.68
Steve came back the me scan over McCool

376.28 --> 387.79999999999995
Hagrid wells you'd flat out faith

381.68 --> 391.7
drunken bullet for one one Steve alone

387.8 --> 400.28000000000003
hyena badge badge

391.7 --> 410.15
Oh page James Mason of course Jeremy a

400.28 --> 414.67999999999995
Bennett yeah good Co hmm so let's see

410.15 --> 420.48999999999995
what you guys are talking about I was

414.68 --> 424.16
kind of originally hoping that I get on

420.49 --> 432.16
Mindwarp today unfortunately he seems to

424.16 --> 433.90000000000003
be afk that's kind of disappointing

432.16 --> 439.07000000000005
maybe

433.9 --> 440.84999999999997
Dejan will join me that would be good

439.07 --> 443.989
I'm gonna ask him

440.85 --> 443.98900000000003
[Music]

449.65 --> 460.92999999999995
don't know what he's doing but at least

451.3 --> 463.389
he's not afk on skype right so hey if

460.93 --> 467.77
anybody else maybe in chat or listening

463.389 --> 470.699
right now once the yeah come on my show

467.77 --> 473.139
I have a talk or give some kind of

470.699 --> 477.13
presentation or monologue or whatever

473.139 --> 480.13
and your name is not Brenda then please

477.13 --> 483.37
contact me on skype the yeah Skype

480.13 --> 487.0
address is in description box below it's

483.37 --> 490.539
the first line in it contact me there

487.0 --> 492.729
and yeah I will have talked with you and

490.539 --> 495.18
get you on the show especially if I know

492.729 --> 495.18
who you are

496.35 --> 501.09000000000003
mmm Yello Jeremy Bennett

525.71 --> 530.24
well stone monkey 3d I don't think that

528.41 --> 534.14
radar really is light

530.24 --> 539.779
I think radar kind of falls

534.14 --> 542.24
I'm not sure though it's I don't fully

539.779 --> 544.1
understand there is an assumption that

542.24 --> 548.8100000000001
radio and light are supposed to be

544.1 --> 551.39
connected I don't know I think like for

548.81 --> 555.2299999999999
example sound is clearly a wave it's a

551.39 --> 561.08
medium it's pressure based effect medium

555.23 --> 565.339
transit vibration but it's radio that as

561.08 --> 567.08
well yeah if it is radiation then I

565.339 --> 569.589
don't know about that speed

567.08 --> 569.589
really

580.47 --> 586.259
you know what it would be kind of good

582.75 --> 589.79
to have like a list and put all these

586.259 --> 599.79
effects all these types of things light

589.79 --> 601.5889999999999
radio radioactivity radar put them all

599.79 --> 603.269
yeah the definitely what they are and

601.589 --> 605.6990000000001
what they're supposed to be and what

603.269 --> 609.839
their effects us are in like a list

605.699 --> 612.5089999999999
almost like a matrix like list so you

609.839 --> 617.5400000000001
could compare them what what is at least

612.509 --> 620.939
assumed of them because I I just don't I

617.54 --> 624.87
haven't seen that proof that light has a

620.939 --> 629.04
speed there's a lot of extrapolation

624.87 --> 630.9590000000001
okay but I haven't seen it the actual

629.04 --> 636.18
thing that's supposed to prove that it

630.959 --> 640.0189999999999
has a speed the only thing that I've

636.18 --> 645.8
seen that has speeds are things relating

640.019 --> 648.36
to matter and at it sound is a medium

645.8 --> 653.329
transfer it's a medium effect and it

648.36 --> 658.35
actually the actual thing is matter so

653.329 --> 662.579
that's why in my I guess philosophical

658.35 --> 665.73
opinion it can have a speed that seems

662.579 --> 669.449
logical but when it doesn't when it's

665.73 --> 672.839
like its own independent energy I think

669.449 --> 676.3499999999999
it's mostly just instantaneous I don't

672.839 --> 679.37
get this concept of that it's supposed

676.35 --> 679.37
to have a speed I

682.12 --> 687.35
I'm really surprised because I've been

685.04 --> 691.279
saying this for a while now and I'm

687.35 --> 694.4590000000001
expecting that some wiseass people out

691.279 --> 696.829
there that know so much about these

694.459 --> 699.17
things have studied up on all the books

696.829 --> 702.1099999999999
are just gonna come on my channel in my

699.17 --> 705.17
chat and just say are we in our win our

702.11 --> 708.23
win you know that's it's a pretty

705.17 --> 711.9799999999999
interesting thought but look here is

708.23 --> 715.85
exactly that proof that really shows you

711.98 --> 719.3290000000001
that it does travels at a speed you know

715.85 --> 721.639
it's not happening nobody's doing that

719.329 --> 723.649
the a quantum eraser supposedly does

721.639 --> 729.0790000000001
that and then he forwards me to some

723.649 --> 732.47
other type of body of stuff that doesn't

729.079 --> 735.1099999999999
prove the speed it never does

732.47 --> 737.24
he hasn't nobody else has where is it

735.11 --> 744.009
where is the proof that light has a

737.24 --> 747.74
speed you know the only proof the first

744.009 --> 754.12
approach and even of the idea that light

747.74 --> 756.86
has a speed in my search came from

754.12 --> 758.779
Einstein I think that he may have been

756.86 --> 765.86
the first to claim that light has a

758.779 --> 768.639
speed that's kind of telling are you

765.86 --> 768.639
guys listening

785.99 --> 793.25
no but you'd write no wait ah stone

791.18 --> 795.5
monkey 3d yes you sometimes seem to

793.25 --> 799.22
forward some entry look depth cameras

795.5 --> 801.47
and speed visible yeah but again that

799.22 --> 804.53
doesn't prove that light itself has a

801.47 --> 806.95
speed and that that speed differential

804.53 --> 810.4
is the thing that is measured no it's

806.95 --> 815.45
frequency and when the frequency

810.4 --> 819.05
resonates the light that's when there is

815.45 --> 822.95
a like a that that's it and then based

819.05 --> 825.68
on those frequency correlations that is

822.95 --> 827.69
how they deduce the depth that is how

825.68 --> 829.4899999999999
they reconstructed it is something that

827.69 --> 832.5200000000001
you can deduce from light frequency

829.49 --> 837.25
apparently that does not prove that the

832.52 --> 837.25
light itself is traveling at a speed

838.84 --> 847.4
look just imagine how fast light is

843.26 --> 851.0
supposed to travel that is so insane how

847.4 --> 853.16
can you ever practically measure that

851.0 --> 857.03
and get some information from that's

853.16 --> 860.0
like measuring the thief extrapolated

857.03 --> 861.89
actual gravity effect you know that

860.0 --> 864.08
thing how can you ever measure it's

861.89 --> 868.61
solely insignificant well with speed

864.08 --> 871.58
it's so overkill how can you ever get

868.61 --> 876.25
any kind of sensible measurement no it's

871.58 --> 876.25
a frequency deduction based process

881.05 --> 887.38
it's the light frequency of the beam

883.69 --> 893.5300000000001
that does something that is something

887.38 --> 897.0
that can yeah resonate somehow it's

893.53 --> 900.22
weird it kind of does suggest by the way

897.0 --> 903.13
it presents it all presents itself that

900.22 --> 905.44
the wave idea or it's more like a snare

903.13 --> 907.57
look you have sound waves amplitude and

905.44 --> 910.6
all sound waves now they're literally

907.57 --> 913.6600000000001
like matter compressing in resonance and

910.6 --> 916.02
that creates a longitudinal sound wave

913.66 --> 922.24
it's also what comes out of speakers you

916.02 --> 925.5699999999999
know out of these things amplitude '''l

922.24 --> 928.29
waves are basically created from that

925.57 --> 931.9300000000001
little thing pushing back and forth

928.29 --> 935.6999999999999
that's an applet O'Donnell sound wave

931.93 --> 942.25
but you also have snare sound and a

935.7 --> 946.87
snare requires a a basically a medium a

942.25 --> 949.81
thing that is present it doesn't travel

946.87 --> 954.22
a speed it's hit and then it resonates

949.81 --> 956.05
and depending on the matter and

954.22 --> 959.6800000000001
everything it resonates and creates a

956.05 --> 962.5899999999999
certain sound that's also sound but

959.68 --> 965.4699999999999
that's very specific to a stuck thing as

962.59 --> 969.7
it were it's another type of sound that

965.47 --> 974.32
doesn't travel a speed that's actually

969.7 --> 977.25
pure frequency based its shape based

974.32 --> 977.25
frequency

979.17 --> 988.91
I think that is more like how light is

985.769 --> 992.819
used it's an instantaneous connection

988.91 --> 995.879
that manifests and there is a frequency

992.819 --> 1000.3789999999999
that could probably be compared with the

995.879 --> 1005.119
vibrating of a guitar snare that is how

1000.379 --> 1008.29
I kind of visualize it but there is no

1005.119 --> 1011.149
actual matter doing that it is purely

1008.29 --> 1013.04
conceptualization it is almost

1011.149 --> 1015.649
comparable to the wave function although

1013.04 --> 1017.449
that is mathematically and yea built

1015.649 --> 1020.299
this is more conceptual of trying to

1017.449 --> 1023.66
figure out the light frequencies what is

1020.299 --> 1027.529
that it's not a medium transfer change

1023.66 --> 1029.51
it's not speed it's just a change in the

1027.529 --> 1033.37
nature of the light itself in the

1029.51 --> 1038.149
frequency and that changes things colors

1033.37 --> 1041.6299999999999
but does it really change the speed how

1038.149 --> 1044.6889999999999
fast is red light how fast is blue light

1041.63 --> 1049.669
how fast is green light and how can

1044.689 --> 1051.44
white light be uniform so easily why

1049.669 --> 1059.169
doesn't the sky look like a giant

1051.44 --> 1059.169
rainbow all of the time see

1064.299 --> 1070.01
right well thank you mark colored yeah I

1067.58 --> 1072.9189999999999
kind of agree with I don't like to agree

1070.01 --> 1075.59
because after everything we've been

1072.919 --> 1079.429
through I kind of do appreciate John

1075.59 --> 1082.28
this sounds weird don't see it as some

1079.429 --> 1086.419
kind of Stockholm Syndrome because I

1082.28 --> 1089.8999999999999
definitely am NOT bound by his authority

1086.419 --> 1096.38
as you have seen demonstrated I hope you

1089.9 --> 1100.01
paid attention to that but I really I

1096.38 --> 1103.2800000000002
think I've pretty much been able to

1100.01 --> 1105.59
really use my senses to scout out who he

1103.28 --> 1109.22
is despite his act because it is an act

1105.59 --> 1111.9189999999999
I I give rarely get the feeling the

1109.22 --> 1113.9
person is genuinely himself maybe when

1111.919 --> 1116.96
he's more in a giggly mood that's

1113.9 --> 1119.179
probably more genuinely John than his

1116.96 --> 1122.32
drill sergeant act because that is an

1119.179 --> 1125.96
act and that act is obviously like a

1122.32 --> 1128.57
it's like a nerd act it's it comes out

1125.96 --> 1131.419
of natural insecurity or the inability

1128.57 --> 1133.07
to properly wield a natural state so you

1131.419 --> 1135.8300000000002
have to construct something artificial

1133.07 --> 1138.6789999999999
to guide all the impulses that tend to

1135.83 --> 1141.4089999999999
go out of control and give a purpose to

1138.679 --> 1144.98
the excess energy and he chose the drill

1141.409 --> 1146.7800000000002
sergeant to do that so it's kind of

1144.98 --> 1150.14
psychological I did not saying that he's

1146.78 --> 1152.6
some kind of [ __ ] absolutely not but

1150.14 --> 1155.2990000000002
he is emotionally burdened and I

1152.6 --> 1160.039
recognize it because I have similar

1155.299 --> 1162.4089999999999
effects although he probably has it even

1160.039 --> 1164.809
stronger in the iron Department he gave

1162.409 --> 1170.0300000000002
me when he gets angry really gets angry

1164.809 --> 1172.94
I I get insidious but still then I have

1170.03 --> 1176.6589999999999
some kind of control and John just loses

1172.94 --> 1178.75
it loses his social sensibility when he

1176.659 --> 1182.179
gets pissed off and it gets really

1178.75 --> 1185.6
annoying but yeah that's his problem but

1182.179 --> 1188.51
beside that I separated from his actual

1185.6 --> 1189.789
technical insight and he has helped so

1188.51 --> 1192.799
much

1189.789 --> 1195.3799999999999
it's a weird comparison perhaps but I'd

1192.799 --> 1197.3899999999999
like to compare it to Alex Jones you

1195.38 --> 1201.23
know Alex Jones has serious issues

1197.39 --> 1203.929
there's just issues of an issue from

1201.23 --> 1207.98
personal character issue up until

1203.929 --> 1213.3500000000001
business choices and political agenda

1207.98 --> 1216.5
then it's kind of unclear to me but

1213.35 --> 1219.049
there so but still yeah he taught me so

1216.5 --> 1221.89
many things back then and he still kind

1219.049 --> 1228.02
of stands behind that although it just

1221.89 --> 1231.5590000000002
gets more ya jumble it jumbles around

1228.02 --> 1235.039
with with the approach more more it's

1231.559 --> 1239.0
less consistent at it but still so there

1235.039 --> 1243.11
are so much issues with Alex Jones but I

1239.0 --> 1246.5
can't forget how he helped me how he

1243.11 --> 1249.049
made me snap out of liberalism because

1246.5 --> 1251.57
he did that he it's weird

1249.049 --> 1255.049
in retrospect er really oversimplified

1251.57 --> 1262.1899999999998
but I shared many times that I used to

1255.049 --> 1264.59
be a liberal like sick call it a modest

1262.19 --> 1268.13
and Tifa person in the time when antifa

1264.59 --> 1271.549
wasn't so blatantly demonic yet but they

1268.13 --> 1277.13
were still already pushy and just angry

1271.549 --> 1280.57
and and a lot of yes self-worth issues

1277.13 --> 1285.6200000000001
and all that that was even back then and

1280.57 --> 1287.78
I was kind of hanging around in that as

1285.62 --> 1290.51
well not fanatically because I didn't

1287.78 --> 1293.299
like communism I never liked it

1290.51 --> 1299.32
with the the Rock'em I liked the idea I

1293.299 --> 1305.27
liked an idea of being communal and just

1299.32 --> 1308.45
yeah defend your group that thing but

1305.27 --> 1311.2
they what actual combination really is

1308.45 --> 1315.8300000000002
even traditionally historically is just

1311.2 --> 1318.02
it's pure two-faced luring you in with

1315.83 --> 1320.6299999999999
promises doing exactly the opposite

1318.02 --> 1324.59
every single time and that's something

1320.63 --> 1328.3200000000002
that's a lesson that it wouldn't get in

1324.59 --> 1331.35
just like people with flat earth is like

1328.32 --> 1334.86
no no I did yeah I don't really have

1331.35 --> 1337.08
arguments but it can be it has to be a

1334.86 --> 1341.039
globe it just must this can't be real

1337.08 --> 1343.5
it's too much well I had that with

1341.039 --> 1346.74
liberalism I really thought like no did

1343.5 --> 1350.279
this this can't be real I have to make

1346.74 --> 1356.549
it the way I see it I have to put that

1350.279 --> 1359.82
and then over time I just I figured out

1356.549 --> 1365.399
like [ __ ] thanks to alex jones like wow

1359.82 --> 1367.95
I was wrong I'm glad that I didn't med

1365.399 --> 1370.4699999999998
like do things with it like really get

1367.95 --> 1372.929
out there with ant I found that kind of

1370.47 --> 1375.59
[ __ ] I could have chosen that against

1372.929 --> 1379.74
better judgment but I didn't and then

1375.59 --> 1382.6789999999999
let it more and more and more I got over

1379.74 --> 1386.22
it very very very slowly like [ __ ] there

1382.679 --> 1389.73
is no redemption for this group there

1386.22 --> 1392.96
really and they don't want it that's the

1389.73 --> 1397.1100000000001
most insane thing they don't want be

1392.96 --> 1401.6100000000001
redemption do you understand

1397.11 --> 1403.59
it's really crazy and I just couldn't

1401.61 --> 1405.87
handle that I refused to believe that

1403.59 --> 1407.82
but it took a lot of time and Alex Jones

1405.87 --> 1411.2689999999998
helped me through that last period by

1407.82 --> 1413.58
really shoving the elite plan the

1411.269 --> 1416.059
corruption what's kind of going on out

1413.58 --> 1418.9499999999998
there outside of my normal daily life

1416.059 --> 1421.83
side and he shared so much information

1418.95 --> 1424.46
and that really snapped me out of it and

1421.83 --> 1426.629
that made me decide wait what I wanted

1424.46 --> 1429.69
it's not communism

1426.629 --> 1434.9289999999999
it's libertarianism and that was still a

1429.69 --> 1434.929
raw conceptualization back then and

1436.98 --> 1443.99
since then I've more and more retracted

1440.43 --> 1448.44
from the idea of pursuing specific

1443.99 --> 1451.02
political ideology and more and more I

1448.44 --> 1455.49
am just noticing no it's it's not about

1451.02 --> 1458.1
a structural format or in principles of

1455.49 --> 1464.01
that it really is about the individual

1458.1 --> 1467.2199999999998
action and freedom indeed like Owen

1464.01 --> 1470.43
Benjamin even reason out it it needs to

1467.22 --> 1473.88
have these limits and that limitation is

1470.43 --> 1476.3300000000002
not gonna just present itself

1473.88 --> 1479.19
automatically within the framework of

1476.33 --> 1482.22
the libertarian ideology and that's a

1479.19 --> 1486.21
big problem so there has to be something

1482.22 --> 1489.44
else besides libertarianism to really

1486.21 --> 1492.51
repair the entire situation and that

1489.44 --> 1496.29
will be like Owen Benjamin kind of says

1492.51 --> 1500.64
in his own way it will be individual

1496.29 --> 1503.87
Christianity not Church slaves or

1500.64 --> 1509.0700000000002
followers but the individual Christian

1503.87 --> 1514.08
that really tries to do it right but

1509.07 --> 1516.12
isn't a fool that not paranoid not

1514.08 --> 1519.21
fooled just following the right

1516.12 --> 1524.4299999999998
frequency doing good when it will do

1519.21 --> 1527.03
good and walking away when there's

1524.43 --> 1531.29
nothing positive that can come out of it

1527.03 --> 1537.45
that kind of just personal principle

1531.29 --> 1539.46
Christian living and not necessarily if

1537.45 --> 1544.77
you don't have to freaking hate on gays

1539.46 --> 1548.16
all that [ __ ] you know that I think you

1544.77 --> 1552.3899999999999
could I think that homophobia should

1548.16 --> 1555.03
basically up to a certain extent just be

1552.39 --> 1556.8000000000002
considered natural but that doesn't mean

1555.03 --> 1559.1399999999999
that somebody that is supposedly

1556.8 --> 1561.21
homophobic should then freaking attack

1559.14 --> 1565.66
gay people or something no absolutely

1561.21 --> 1568.03
not of course that breaks goes too far

1565.66 --> 1571.95
but you don't have to be forced to like

1568.03 --> 1571.95
gay people I think that's ridiculous

1574.53 --> 1580.57
right you hate well the sin yeah but

1579.13 --> 1582.64
that's again that's a frequency it's

1580.57 --> 1585.9399999999998
like when they when somebody does

1582.64 --> 1590.1100000000001
something that just feels bad it

1585.94 --> 1595.21
radiates bad that that thing so it's not

1590.11 --> 1598.4499999999998
even about gay this is getting too

1595.21 --> 1602.8600000000001
complicated anyway I think that yeah

1598.45 --> 1608.26
indeed libertarianism can be a a better

1602.86 --> 1611.59
guide than old-fashioned capitalism

1608.26 --> 1615.34
which is just will create total

1611.59 --> 1624.1899999999998
oligarchy or communism which will create

1615.34 --> 1626.3799999999999
a total statism so libertarian will

1624.19 --> 1629.68
still be a good middle ground but it

1626.38 --> 1633.25
doesn't really lead to a an end result

1629.68 --> 1636.16
really always risks of destabilizing and

1633.25 --> 1638.95
to way to stabilize that is to keep in a

1636.16 --> 1641.92
stable good set of cultural principles

1638.95 --> 1644.41
that will prevent things from going out

1641.92 --> 1648.3300000000002
of control which they naturally will if

1644.41 --> 1656.0400000000002
you don't do that it's very complicated

1648.33 --> 1660.01
and you know who is always always always

1656.04 --> 1664.2
gonna come back get into business

1660.01 --> 1670.15
whatever get and start to do weird

1664.2 --> 1672.28
advertising weird new culture they're

1670.15 --> 1676.21
always gonna try to pervert it like

1672.28 --> 1680.02
libertarianism is is mores is just as

1676.21 --> 1683.98
susceptible to perversions as capitalism

1680.02 --> 1686.65
is and then I'm talking about the more

1683.98 --> 1690.3
open cultural perversions like a secret

1686.65 --> 1693.7900000000002
perversions that's yeah that's different

1690.3 --> 1697.3
libertarianism is just as

1693.79 --> 1700.0
at risk as capitalism it doesn't make

1697.3 --> 1704.11
perversion go away it has to be from a

1700.0 --> 1711.31
cultural angle to get that get that out

1704.11 --> 1713.53
of the way so I don't know it's a weed

1711.31 --> 1716.1599999999999
line it may be I hope you found it

1713.53 --> 1716.16
interesting

1726.09 --> 1731.04
it's weird I got all this food and not

1729.19 --> 1735.01
even that hungry

1731.04 --> 1738.12
now maybe I'll take a bite of the Apple

1735.01 --> 1738.12
a bit later on

1745.22 --> 1747.91
all right

1751.41 --> 1760.22
when are we going to England then I have

1757.38 --> 1760.22
no idea

1763.77 --> 1772.47
are we going to England then as far as I

1767.33 --> 1775.8799999999999
what's but why would I go there what

1772.47 --> 1775.88
would you want to do in England

1781.88 --> 1789.169
for what I'm intrigued by the concept

1786.59 --> 1793.9099999999999
but what do you want to do in England a

1789.169 --> 1800.71
great wells I'll meet up with Nathan hmm

1793.91 --> 1800.71
right could be interesting sure

1804.41 --> 1808.929
it would be kind of better if I had a

1806.299 --> 1808.929
camera though

1814.0 --> 1821.32
okay well it's an interesting idea I'll

1817.09 --> 1824.83
keep it in mind like that but yeah

1821.32 --> 1827.62
really to actually go somewhere for me I

1824.83 --> 1830.62
really wish I had a camera because then

1827.62 --> 1834.1799999999998
yeah you go somewhere and you also have

1830.62 --> 1837.1
some extra material as a payoff for the

1834.18 --> 1844.21
for the excursion for the investment as

1837.1 --> 1847.27
it were the traveling debate show now

1844.21 --> 1850.8400000000001
for a traveling debate show I I would

1847.27 --> 1859.3899999999999
need like a mobile set up from which I

1850.84 --> 1861.61
could stream alright the camera was well

1859.39 --> 1866.0200000000002
if you take a p900 I think those could

1861.61 --> 1867.9399999999998
be gotten for like 400 euros so if there

1866.02 --> 1873.55
was a hurry but the one I was kind of

1867.94 --> 1875.53
aiming for was a thousand you want that

1873.55 --> 1878.8
infrared camera huh

1875.53 --> 1882.04
I think the infrared is like a

1878.8 --> 1883.6599999999999
modification I don't know I'm not in a

1882.04 --> 1885.46
camera expert really there are some

1883.66 --> 1886.15
people out there know a lot more about

1885.46 --> 1890.56
it than I do

1886.15 --> 1896.7
you probably should ask Renta jeez yeah

1890.56 --> 1896.7
well you know he has p900 and ap1000

1898.18 --> 1902.5800000000002
Oh 702 [ __ ] okay

1913.15 --> 1920.26
yeah more colored I would it would be a

1917.17 --> 1923.6200000000001
great excuse for me to get out there

1920.26 --> 1925.809
maybe visit the beach and just do

1923.62 --> 1928.03
something similar and that would be one

1925.809 --> 1931.36
of the things I'd also just tried to

1928.03 --> 1933.3999999999999
make interesting landscape look I really

1931.36 --> 1937.08
appreciate the beauty of nature for

1933.4 --> 1942.7
example so I would definitely also spend

1937.08 --> 1946.1499999999999
some of my photo time on that I've done

1942.7 --> 1949.45
it before but back then I'd had it was

1946.15 --> 1952.0900000000001
like a camera roll so you don't just

1949.45 --> 1954.429
have thousands of pictures or all that I

1952.09 --> 1957.4599999999998
never got to that point I've always I've

1954.429 --> 1961.5400000000002
never been really a digital photo guy oh

1957.46 --> 1965.74
yeah with my old mobile bit Murray had

1961.54 --> 1967.33
very limited memory but yeah there's a

1965.74 --> 1970.15
lot of things I could do with a camera I

1967.33 --> 1972.76
would also do I would really try to get

1970.15 --> 1974.679
some moon footage going I could finally

1972.76 --> 1977.559
get proper moon footage and I'd get

1974.679 --> 1979.44
other celestial phenomena like the weird

1977.559 --> 1983.94
strange

1979.44 --> 1989.91
Morning Glory at half-past two at night

1983.94 --> 1989.91
just to get that scene it is so weird

1995.1 --> 2001.07
so yeah

1997.26 --> 2003.799
I don't if I had a camera I'm not gonna

2001.07 --> 2007.9399999999998
run out of doing things with that any

2003.799 --> 2010.16
time soon and they're probably on the

2007.94 --> 2012.46
way more things I discovered that I can

2010.16 --> 2012.46
do it

2024.08 --> 2027.28
[Music]

2051.73 --> 2056.649
yeah yeah you it definitely is very

2054.94 --> 2059.44
interesting it is interesting with all

2056.649 --> 2062.2599999999998
the celestial phenomena how cameras are

2059.44 --> 2066.429
able to focus on something that is free

2062.26 --> 2069.3100000000004
supposedly so incredibly far away that's

2066.429 --> 2071.9700000000003
weird is that it's also funny because

2069.31 --> 2076.869
yeah optical phenomena even illusions

2071.97 --> 2080.7999999999997
have their own apparent distance kind of

2076.869 --> 2085.54
thing or focus point and a camera will

2080.8 --> 2089.71
just recognize that it's fascinating so

2085.54 --> 2095.669
added a camera could definitely focus in

2089.71 --> 2095.669
on an illusion even on the hologram

2110.96 --> 2116.7400000000002
I have no favorite English word Scirocco

2124.59 --> 2129.6600000000003
there are words that have like a funny

2127.35 --> 2133.23
twist to it so maybe for example the

2129.66 --> 2135.3599999999997
word smithereens when you blow something

2133.23 --> 2137.37
to smithereens I always thought that was

2135.36 --> 2140.27
kind of a funny word it's not my

2137.37 --> 2140.27
favorite word though

2142.73 --> 2158.33
antidisestablishmentarianism that's

2147.2 --> 2161.1
definitely not my favorite word and I

2158.33 --> 2163.88
disestablishment Arianism what a crazy

2161.1 --> 2163.88
where that is

2179.36 --> 2184.76
all right face I don't know what

2181.34 --> 2186.3500000000004
happened Bronte maybe have technical

2184.76 --> 2188.1200000000003
difficult I don't know what happened he

2186.35 --> 2193.7599999999998
said like Brenda did a no-show

2188.12 --> 2197.56
I suspect that Rena simply did not do

2193.76 --> 2200.48
what she was asked she did not hand in a

2197.56 --> 2203.2999999999997
pre-recorded presentation she just

2200.48 --> 2205.13
wanted to do it it life and that's why

2203.3 --> 2210.05
he decided to cancel because she was

2205.13 --> 2213.29
just not yeah fulfilling the demands for

2210.05 --> 2215.9
the show setting I think that's what

2213.29 --> 2221.84
happened but I haven't heard from Randy

2215.9 --> 2224.8
to confirm or disconfirm that so yeah

2221.84 --> 2228.88
face it was supposed to be Brenda's

2224.8 --> 2228.88
presentation for something

2241.01 --> 2246.82
maybe for proof of curvature that kind

2243.77 --> 2246.82
of nonsense I don't know

2255.77 --> 2266.599
multi syllabic multi syllabic that's a

2263.01 --> 2266.599
that's a terrible word

2277.66 --> 2281.92
there's not a lot of words by the way

2279.88 --> 2284.7690000000002
that I can figure out how to pronounce

2281.92 --> 2288.5190000000002
yet properly pronunciation has always

2284.769 --> 2291.3089999999997
been let's just say that when I was

2288.519 --> 2296.2589999999996
young I was very sloppy with the way I

2291.309 --> 2298.329
was speaking I was Lizzy muffled talking

2296.259 --> 2301.119
I would barely articulate and they

2298.329 --> 2304.15
really like punished me and like at a

2301.119 --> 2308.349
period forced me to articulate properly

2304.15 --> 2311.859
and now funny enough when I feel better

2308.349 --> 2313.69
I enforce that to become clear in my

2311.859 --> 2315.7889999999998
expression because everybody likes that

2313.69 --> 2318.539
more things are more pleasant and it's

2315.789 --> 2322.809
more useful for while having a program

2318.539 --> 2324.789
so when I mumble nowadays

2322.809 --> 2326.8590000000004
that's for people that know me that's

2324.789 --> 2331.329
kind of a sign like are you alright

2326.859 --> 2335.4
Arwen because yeah like that's usually a

2331.329 --> 2335.4
sign you don't feel good about something

2336.059 --> 2343.1400000000003
but your articulation I learned it and I

2339.519 --> 2345.6699999999996
trained it it was like a continual hobby

2343.14 --> 2347.65
every time a word like oh what language

2345.67 --> 2349.599
how do you pronounce it that how do they

2347.65 --> 2353.289
pronounce you like I wanted to know how

2349.599 --> 2354.9900000000002
to pronounce she ate the word more than

2353.289 --> 2357.9900000000002
I even wanted to know what it meant

2354.99 --> 2357.99
really

2363.26 --> 2368.869
let's just say for example if I would

2366.14 --> 2371.5699999999997
now try attempt to really learn some

2368.869 --> 2375.98
pretty radical foreign language like

2371.57 --> 2378.6800000000003
Chinese Japanese or Russian I would

2375.98 --> 2382.63
probably first of all learn how to

2378.68 --> 2393.83
pronounce yet everything correctly first

2382.63 --> 2397.4500000000003
because yeah that Einstein Einstein that

2393.83 --> 2400.45
that's spelled incorrectly really

2397.45 --> 2400.45
Einstein

2407.02 --> 2413.89
try to trick me well yeah Oh iron

2417.32 --> 2425.4500000000003
yeah it it's difficult for non-english

2421.31 --> 2429.98
the naturally pronouncing pronunciate

2425.45 --> 2432.46
iron as iron that really by weight when

2429.98 --> 2436.66
you say like that it almost feels Irish

2432.46 --> 2445.9700000000003
but we tend to say iron or like iron

2436.66 --> 2450.16
it's a very subtle difference usually

2445.97 --> 2450.16
it's iron no it's iron

2453.1 --> 2456.239
[Music]

2458.29 --> 2461.29
Einstein

2465.099 --> 2472.369
well you want me to pronounce it

2467.359 --> 2474.68
American Einstein now i'm pronounciating

2472.369 --> 2478.099
it according to the root of the language

2474.68 --> 2480.98
more Germanic so it's einstein's that's

2478.099 --> 2482.4700000000003
how the name is said how he probably

2480.98 --> 2487.03
said it

2482.47 --> 2487.0299999999997
my name is ein Schein

2493.62 --> 2500.17
I know Billy was and that's what I said

2497.02 --> 2500.17
[Music]

2507.28 --> 2510.4790000000003
[Music]

2517.06 --> 2522.7
I think that and every name basically

2519.52 --> 2528.25
that anyone has should be pronunciate it

2522.7 --> 2531.8199999999997
according to the roots oh yeah where

2528.25 --> 2535.42
they came like the language from which

2531.82 --> 2537.52
the name was given because the

2535.42 --> 2541.36
pronunciation really matters for the

2537.52 --> 2545.67
character of the name and the effect it

2541.36 --> 2545.67
will have on the person as they grow up

2553.8 --> 2558.6800000000003
I've got three three flinch Stein

2568.89 --> 2575.16
oh yeah well of course I'm Angola fiying

2572.309 --> 2577.92
my own name are win because in Dutch

2575.16 --> 2584.489
it's just pronounciating in a way that's

2577.92 --> 2589.16
just impossible for English alright this

2584.489 --> 2589.16
is just good luck down

2598.24 --> 2605.56
no but that's that's wrong now that's

2601.75 --> 2609.88
pronunciate it arwing it's not when it's

2605.56 --> 2612.79
then eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

2609.88 --> 2615.79
Oh bang good luck with that

2612.79 --> 2622.3
it doesn't exist no it's not fine

2615.79 --> 2629.23
then not fine then good luck with that I

2622.3 --> 2635.65
know it doesn't exist in English and

2629.23 --> 2639.4900000000002
it's not Wayne either it's bang you look

2635.65 --> 2644.83
you can put together all kinds of all

2639.49 --> 2648.2799999999997
these all these sounds it doesn't exist

2644.83 --> 2651.94
in the English language

2648.28 --> 2656.619
good luck with it that's why I just said

2651.94 --> 2663.089
Arwen no it's like everything you put

2656.619 --> 2663.089
down doesn't use that verb so

2683.13 --> 2688.4300000000003
okay PJ it's just

2694.4 --> 2708.23
that's that's just so silly mm yeah

2702.95 --> 2710.8399999999997
maybe I'm gonna get still has green on

2708.23 --> 2715.52
it I'm gonna leave it there take a bag

2710.84 --> 2717.32
out this Apple no it doesn't get close

2715.52 --> 2722.95
it's not our wine

2717.32 --> 2727.8700000000003
it's our vein ay ay ay ay ay ay

2722.95 --> 2727.87
okay good luck with that

2729.37 --> 2742.06
it's not mine aim it doesn't exist it's

2739.85 --> 2746.38
it's just like in the more northern

2742.06 --> 2751.04
dialects in Scandinavia have the earth

2746.38 --> 2752.9900000000002
the that doesn't exist in the in the

2751.04 --> 2756.08
Dutch language either and doesn't exist

2752.99 --> 2758.9599999999996
in English good luck with that you can

2756.08 --> 2764.17
imagine whatever should be sounding it

2758.96 --> 2764.17
it doesn't exist in the English language

2770.04 --> 2774.98
hurdy-gurdy right

2799.59 --> 2809.25
how you say your name in Dutch I just

2803.64 --> 2814.08
did that menu but it's all men but then

2809.25 --> 2816.96
again I don't use that name in my normal

2814.08 --> 2819.39
day-to-day face-to-face conduct I use my

2816.96 --> 2826.89
normal front name this is my unique name

2819.39 --> 2830.7799999999997
the one that my mother gave me new type

2826.89 --> 2833.1299999999997
Arwen in google and well let's see

2830.78 --> 2833.88
probably gonna get a shitload of troll

2833.13 --> 2842.1600000000003
videos

2833.88 --> 2844.9100000000003
oh my [ __ ] my channel and troll videos

2842.16 --> 2844.91
that's right

2847.41 --> 2856.77
what I'm really I have a video on Vimeo

2851.63 --> 2862.98
what a troll posted a troll video of me

2856.77 --> 2867.35
on Vimeo GUI what I have a hashtag

2862.98 --> 2867.35
Arwen on to what

2869.6 --> 2874.46
Jesus Christ there's a lot of trolls and

2872.69 --> 2876.7400000000002
glow birds that are apparently getting

2874.46 --> 2878.75
all anti Arwen [ __ ] all over the

2876.74 --> 2883.5099999999998
internet and other platforms that's just

2878.75 --> 2883.51
fantastic that's just amazing

2892.9 --> 2897.9
[ __ ] I have a lot of images of me

2899.24 --> 2902.68
they're not that bad even

2906.24 --> 2908.8689999999997
yeah

2910.6 --> 2919.18
yep it's not funny who would have

2915.31 --> 2922.81
thought 10 years ago that on your search

2919.18 --> 2925.02
on my middle name Google would yield so

2922.81 --> 2925.02
much

2932.39 --> 2936.68
now sir check oh no they're just some

2935.18 --> 2940.22
troll video look there's been troll

2936.68 --> 2944.93
videos about me for years especially

2940.22 --> 2946.48
after my first interview with Patricia

2944.93 --> 2949.43
stair

2946.48 --> 2952.999
for which I was kind of a bit of an open

2949.43 --> 2955.1299999999997
fanboy it's like I really like Patricia

2952.999 --> 2958.069
see I like thought she was extra

2955.13 --> 2960.739
incredibly charming and yeah I basically

2958.069 --> 2963.529
completely ignored all the anxiety the

2960.739 --> 2965.529
[ __ ] and all the rumors about all

2963.529 --> 2968.69
that [ __ ] I was surrounding her so and

2965.529 --> 2972.23
the trolls didn't take that very lightly

2968.69 --> 2974.989
so yeah since then I've seen at least

2972.23 --> 2977.66
like twenty or thirty different crazy

2974.989 --> 2979.64
crazy troll videos about me some not

2977.66 --> 2981.91
even that malicious and some are just

2979.64 --> 2981.91
horrific

2982.63 --> 2987.319
I've already seen them all James Mason

2985.039 --> 2993.1400000000003
don't worry about it like you think I'm

2987.319 --> 2996.319
not aware of that come on that that's

2993.14 --> 3000.249
what happens especially if you are a no

2996.319 --> 3005.849
if you are interesting enough for people

3000.249 --> 3005.8489999999997
to actually start making that [ __ ] okay

3016.25 --> 3018.849
yeah

3020.68 --> 3027.25
yeah that's right sir check oh it's

3023.109 --> 3030.97
incredible how much time people have to

3027.25 --> 3032.619
waste but then again it's probably the

3030.97 --> 3035.2599999999998
other way around they literally are

3032.619 --> 3037.7200000000003
trying to escape from actually fixing

3035.26 --> 3040.51
their entire life and in their

3037.72 --> 3044.1699999999996
desperation to find a distraction from

3040.51 --> 3046.059
that they just spend huge amounts of

3044.17 --> 3048.91
time and energy on completely useless

3046.059 --> 3051.4
[ __ ] and that includes troll videos

3048.91 --> 3054.549
about people that they hate that remind

3051.4 --> 3057.2200000000003
me of remind them of that they are

3054.549 --> 3060.849
actually not doing the right thing by

3057.22 --> 3062.4399999999996
basically not fixing their life so it's

3060.849 --> 3064.63
like a doubling down [ __ ] that's

3062.44 --> 3066.73
probably why there are so many 12 videos

3064.63 --> 3068.92
because it's wouldn't surprise me that

3066.73 --> 3071.38
I'd seriously trigger some people

3068.92 --> 3075.789
especially about being so incredibly

3071.38 --> 3079.539
open and literally just leaving my

3075.789 --> 3082.8390000000004
vulnerability out like that to most

3079.539 --> 3086.92
people that is an absolute atrocity they

3082.839 --> 3088.359
can't imagine ever and they literally

3086.92 --> 3092.039
think anyone that does that is a

3088.359 --> 3094.779
complete [ __ ] just for doing that

3092.039 --> 3096.46
because they're so used to just keeping

3094.779 --> 3099.369
everything secret because they think

3096.46 --> 3101.4700000000003
that every piece of information you show

3099.369 --> 3106.75
to the outside world will be used to

3101.47 --> 3109.5989999999997
blackmail you and yeah that used to

3106.75 --> 3112.569
happen kind of sort of and then I

3109.599 --> 3115.779
thought no if I just do everything right

3112.569 --> 3117.67
if I'm just honest then actually unless

3115.779 --> 3120.13
other honest people will recognize it

3117.67 --> 3122.529
the dark ones will separate themselves

3120.13 --> 3124.779
from me and I can move away from them

3122.529 --> 3126.88
after recognizing I will find the right

3124.779 --> 3130.569
ground with the right frequency and then

3126.88 --> 3132.94
build upon that honesty and not be

3130.569 --> 3136.869
intimidated into getting back into

3132.94 --> 3141.069
secrecy again or being tempted into sin

3136.869 --> 3145.51
and then basically try to hide that sin

3141.069 --> 3150.279
and then go back again out of that into

3145.51 --> 3153.96
the secrecy no I'm not gonna do it I

3150.279 --> 3153.96
don't need to

3160.55 --> 3166.27
so yeah I don't know what will happen

3163.5 --> 3168.35
with that [ __ ] on the long run you know

3166.27 --> 3173.15
[Music]

3168.35 --> 3176.22
but I think like yeah how many I guess

3173.15 --> 3177.9300000000003
people that are somewhat familiar even

3176.22 --> 3180.4199999999996
and especially they're really familiar

3177.93 --> 3183.02
ones how many of them don't have some

3180.42 --> 3187.16
weird trolling video about them you know

3183.02 --> 3187.16
it's just a sign of the times

3201.7 --> 3204.39
hmm

3207.98 --> 3212.14
thank you for the super chat donation

3209.99 --> 3216.29
Amanda young much appreciated

3212.14 --> 3221.0499999999997
$5.00 misery loves company Arwen that's

3216.29 --> 3225.589
right the misery is actually addictive

3221.05 --> 3228.82
it racks you down in the miss assumption

3225.589 --> 3233.48
that being to the bottom

3228.82 --> 3237.05
somehow hewed something positive and I

3233.48 --> 3239.66
used to be there and the kind of

3237.05 --> 3242.2400000000002
stepping out of a depression was

3239.66 --> 3246.17
exhilarating it's like waking up and

3242.24 --> 3249.3199999999997
suddenly you can start over again but if

3246.17 --> 3251.4500000000003
you made a giant mess while you were

3249.32 --> 3254.48
there then you'll be faced with that so

3251.45 --> 3256.25
it never really really works unless you

3254.48 --> 3258.8
can contain yourself when you get

3256.25 --> 3263.18
depressed and not create havoc around

3258.8 --> 3266.3590000000004
you which I luckily never really did a

3263.18 --> 3269.06
lot with me depression usually just made

3266.359 --> 3272.15
me abruptly and social contact with

3269.06 --> 3273.43
people that's the most the damage that

3272.15 --> 3276.89
it used to do with me

3273.43 --> 3281.1699999999996
which shouldn't be underestimated by the

3276.89 --> 3281.17
way it really did isolate me a lot

3289.31 --> 3301.36
but yeah do not underestimate just like

3298.16 --> 3302.8999999999996
getting a kick or getting excited

3301.36 --> 3306.32
organic aroused

3302.9 --> 3311.54
can be an addictive element that will

3306.32 --> 3313.31
keep calling you so can misery misery is

3311.54 --> 3315.17
simply the other side of the spectrum

3313.31 --> 3317.27
and that other side of the spectrum is

3315.17 --> 3326.8
just as addictive it's just a lot more

3317.27 --> 3331.46
destructive to be there so yeah it's

3326.8 --> 3334.54
essential that anyone that's there just

3331.46 --> 3334.54
gets out of it somehow

3342.56 --> 3351.31
mmm I'm gonna round out the show and

3346.55 --> 3354.8300000000004
going for 55 minutes I think

3351.31 --> 3356.5099999999998
let's see Nathan no no yeah of course

3354.83 --> 3358.93
it's Saturday by the way you could do a

3356.51 --> 3358.9300000000003
bit longer

3365.14 --> 3371.89
huh okay Dejan is working at a golf

3369.07 --> 3374.61
course so he doesn't have time to come

3371.89 --> 3374.6099999999997
on too bad

3375.6 --> 3383.85
yeah Ben Adam sure you can join have you

3381.01 --> 3383.8500000000004
added me on skype

3399.57 --> 3405.0
yeah it's it's just a habit it's like oh

3402.09 --> 3425.4
yeah three o'clock but I forgot again

3405.0 --> 3430.01
for a moment that it's Saturday yeah

3425.4 --> 3430.01
hold on guys Tim that I'm gonna stay

3431.27 --> 3438.33
I'll stay a bit on a bit longer let's

3434.61 --> 3442.83
see who comes out you know what I'll

3438.33 --> 3445.71
just take like a a life break so we're

3442.83 --> 3448.89
normal channels what now cut down and

3445.71 --> 3451.83
shows like show a song cut to

3448.89 --> 3455.3399999999997
commercials I'm just gonna sit here and

3451.83 --> 3462.33
not be very engaging maybe look at chat

3455.34 --> 3466.44
a bit roll a joint why not oh man I

3462.33 --> 3469.3199999999997
gotta show you this but this is really

3466.44 --> 3479.4500000000003
naughty of me but it's just that was a

3469.32 --> 3479.4500000000003
big but look at this it's pretty big

3480.71 --> 3492.6
yeah I'm not gonna smoke that all up in

3485.58 --> 3495.33
one joint anyway now I feel stupid I

3492.6 --> 3498.99
shouldn't drag that stuff in here it's

3495.33 --> 3501.68
not where people came for what the

3498.99 --> 3501.68
people came for him

3504.589 --> 3512.45
no it's not sativa

3506.76 --> 3516.03
I don't smoke sativa I always go for the

3512.45 --> 3519.049
same yeah for the indica gossiped Eva's

3516.03 --> 3519.049
just not good for me

3525.03 --> 3538.4100000000003
Oh mark colored I disagree

3528.09 --> 3544.02
I it is a drug it's just it's just not

3538.41 --> 3546.99
that terrible like the physical

3544.02 --> 3549.78
consequences are not that dramatic or

3546.99 --> 3552.0299999999997
actually could actually be positive if

3549.78 --> 3556.8
you know how to manage it properly and

3552.03 --> 3559.53
especially if you just consume it but I

3556.8 --> 3563.2200000000003
kind of do consider it as like I use

3559.53 --> 3566.73
cannabis and yeah I'm not gonna be like

3563.22 --> 3569.85
oh no I feel like I'm a drug user really

3566.73 --> 3573.36
it is like and I am kind of the mental

3569.85 --> 3575.58
addiction is also there it's something

3573.36 --> 3581.76
that I'm that I'm basically forced to

3575.58 --> 3583.41
deal with and the idea that some people

3581.76 --> 3588.4500000000003
have like oh yeah I could quit any

3583.41 --> 3590.37
moment like no I I have quit before for

3588.45 --> 3593.8799999999997
a long period five years I was terrible

3590.37 --> 3595.47
at for like terrible like really

3593.88 --> 3596.67
struggled through that the first half

3595.47 --> 3598.77
year that was like the first time I

3596.67 --> 3603.26
really quit and it was kind of like

3598.77 --> 3603.2599999999998
meant as permanent and I quit five years

3604.34 --> 3607.4900000000002
no way

3608.41 --> 3620.39
yeah yeah right but now it's not the

3617.6 --> 3627.62
same anymore it's I guess I've become

3620.39 --> 3629.87
more adjusted to using it also because

3627.62 --> 3633.14
I've basically figured out how to better

3629.87 --> 3635.66
use the light utilize the state of mind

3633.14 --> 3637.4
that it also brings that that's why I

3635.66 --> 3640.37
typically smoke a joint right before a

3637.4 --> 3643.52
show because it it does help a little

3640.37 --> 3645.35
it's weird I don't know it it works but

3643.52 --> 3649.37
at the same time it's kind of difficult

3645.35 --> 3651.7999999999997
to quit if I really wanted to for

3649.37 --> 3653.54
example or feel like I need to which I

3651.8 --> 3657.23
kind of do at the moment because of

3653.54 --> 3660.2
combined health reasons like I need my

3657.23 --> 3662.42
body my lungs need a break at least for

3660.2 --> 3665.99
a few days you know and let's see how

3662.42 --> 3673.82
long I can keep that and so does my

3665.99 --> 3677.27
wallet because you could say a lot about

3673.82 --> 3683.21
cannabis in the Netherlands but not that

3677.27 --> 3688.31
it's cheap in the coffee shops although

3683.21 --> 3690.02
it could be worse I guess I'm not

3688.31 --> 3692.21
complaining about the coffee shop where

3690.02 --> 3693.98
I get my cannabis because I think that

3692.21 --> 3696.64
they're still yeah the quality is very

3693.98 --> 3696.64
good

3698.15 --> 3706.069
and I really like the people and they

3700.009 --> 3709.609
kind of know me and nice but yeah it's

3706.069 --> 3712.009
still expensive and I just I wish I

3709.609 --> 3714.98
could get a better grip on it and I've

3712.009 --> 3719.66
also conceptualized that one of the main

3714.98 --> 3721.999
problems is that I despite everything

3719.66 --> 3723.92
despite the activities that I have I

3721.999 --> 3728.4199999999996
still have too much time to waste

3723.92 --> 3730.849
and I somehow need to fill that in in a

3728.42 --> 3734.029
proper way so that I don't get stuck

3730.849 --> 3736.9100000000003
into these almost anxious like smoking

3734.029 --> 3740.24
loops that's like the worst way to spend

3736.91 --> 3744.529
it and I try to prevent that every time

3740.24 --> 3754.1499999999996
I start noticing that I'm doing that hey

3744.529 --> 3754.15
Matt Adams right I see you okay

3754.47 --> 3762.0589999999997
grow your own yeah hey I used to do that

3757.829 --> 3766.38
I used to do that quite well but I don't

3762.059 --> 3768.71
have a garden here and it's just I'm not

3766.38 --> 3773.19
gonna put pots here on the balcony

3768.71 --> 3778.4700000000003
because the weather just is not suitable

3773.19 --> 3784.589
for that it would die so yeah I got you

3778.47 --> 3787.2799999999997
on Ben Adams if you wanna call or shall

3784.589 --> 3787.2799999999997
I call you

3794.49 --> 3802.31
no I don't really need shrooms thanks ah

3799.31 --> 3802.31
right

3804.63 --> 3810.33
hello

3807.24 --> 3834.089
oh please mute your your YouTube page by

3810.33 --> 3848.48
the way ya doing great how are you the

3834.089 --> 3848.48
flat earth debates you mean right yep

3848.78 --> 3866.6090000000004
it's right but look like quantum eraser

3863.16 --> 3869.04
can in the wood because he's not going

3866.609 --> 3872.0989999999997
along with basically the experi

3869.04 --> 3875.19
explosion of these concepts so he's just

3872.099 --> 3877.8
not accepting that his ways are set he

3875.19 --> 3881.4900000000002
believes in what he was taught because

3877.8 --> 3884.1600000000003
he obviously studied it I said he

3881.49 --> 3888.7799999999997
obviously studied this specifically and

3884.16 --> 3891.359
he's in is unwilling to basically give

3888.78 --> 3899.8100000000004
that up or recognize that there may be

3891.359 --> 3899.81
something wrong to it can you hear me

3909.51 --> 3924.09
hello what do you okay that didn't work

3920.01 --> 3926.4900000000002
out yeah and there is probably an echo

3924.09 --> 3929.55
I've noticed it more and more I don't

3926.49 --> 3931.41
know how to fix that it's really

3929.55 --> 3933.9500000000003
annoying I don't know why that happens

3931.41 --> 3933.95
I'm sorry

3941.45 --> 3944.93
yeah and I don't know what happened I

3943.67 --> 3950.66
think he had some kind of connection

3944.93 --> 3955.089
problem as well now a Skype doesn't it's

3950.66 --> 3959.8999999999996
not skypes fault it's because of my

3955.089 --> 3962.0589999999997
incomplete sound works it's it's I'm

3959.9 --> 3965.0
basically improvising with something

3962.059 --> 3968.63
that's not fully equipped to do this

3965.0 --> 3974.839
properly I should be having sound banana

3968.63 --> 3978.17
it didn't work out I'd still like to get

3974.839 --> 3981.319
that put out and we also try to the

3978.17 --> 3984.9500000000003
multi streaming thing but look guys I'm

3981.319 --> 3987.68
just a terrible investigator when it's

3984.95 --> 3992.299
basically about trying out new programs

3987.68 --> 3995.39
or new functions it could really use

3992.299 --> 3998.03
like a guide in that maybe like do a

3995.39 --> 4001.2
Skype call and really work it out on the

3998.03 --> 4003.6090000000004
spot it'll work I know it will like that

4001.2 --> 4005.8799999999997
when I do things my own I just get

4003.609 --> 4009.19
frustrated and confused and then

4005.88 --> 4013.2000000000003
eventually end up walking away it's

4009.19 --> 4013.2000000000003
really annoying I know

4027.16 --> 4034.89
well that's interesting unusual ferocity

4030.57 --> 4037.8900000000003
any empirical evidence of the

4034.89 --> 4040.3799999999997
thermosphere plane to your knowledge

4037.89 --> 4044.68
nope

4040.38 --> 4048.9700000000003
all these atmosphere layers I think

4044.68 --> 4053.5
we're all originally basically made up

4048.97 --> 4055.7799999999997
by NASA - as excuses for their

4053.5 --> 4060.94
interactions with space and everything I

4055.78 --> 4067.7200000000003
don't think any of it is there hello

4060.94 --> 4069.87
welcome back and I think he gets

4067.72 --> 4072.31
confused between one and the other

4069.87 --> 4074.83
because I should be having full coverage

4072.31 --> 4080.92
because I've got an amplifier sweet

4074.83 --> 4083.59
stuff anyway yes I can I am just turning

4080.92 --> 4093.2200000000003
off my putting my mute button on

4083.59 --> 4096.39
otherwise I'm gonna hear you echo the

4093.22 --> 4101.44
echo from the from the computer

4096.39 --> 4106.410000000001
excellent right so a yeah you wanted to

4101.44 --> 4106.41
come out why do you want to talk about a

4128.7 --> 4132.4
conversation and then we can actually

4130.45 --> 4140.28
talk about the things he doesn't want us

4132.4 --> 4140.28
to talk about right yeah

4141.259 --> 4146.63
I caught him basically him and Nathan

4143.96 --> 4150.9800000000005
Strom adding me it was weird it's like

4146.63 --> 4153.4400000000005
they seem to be stuck into this specific

4150.98 --> 4156.259
paradigm where they basically opposed

4153.44 --> 4158.928999999999
the wave concept and look that debate

4156.259 --> 4160.69
way versus particle it's literally been

4158.929 --> 4162.619
going on since the first

4160.69 --> 4164.719
conceptualization of quantum mechanics

4162.619 --> 4171.08
it's always been an issue

4164.719 --> 4172.969
so obviously QE is set in it's made its

4171.08 --> 4175.21
choice in what it what he's gonna do

4172.969 --> 4175.21
with that

4176.679 --> 4181.759
that is so less is not communicative so

4180.23 --> 4185.299
every time I listen to one of his video

4181.759 --> 4187.639
my attention span goes away very quickly

4185.299 --> 4191.69
what is his contention in a nutshell

4187.639 --> 4194.4800000000005
what does he say what does he say what

4191.69 --> 4196.969
he's saying is that everybody's yeah

4194.48 --> 4201.65
he's usually just made yeah pointing out

4196.969 --> 4203.78
how people are going wrong and he a lot

4201.65 --> 4208.099999999999
of the time draws in semantical

4203.78 --> 4211.07
arguments in and sometimes like

4208.1 --> 4212.719
especially with globe proof reasoning in

4211.07 --> 4216.889
the scientific method that's really

4212.719 --> 4219.77
important in this case it's we're trying

4216.889 --> 4221.81
to undo unravel certain presuppositions

4219.77 --> 4225.409000000001
and figuring out is this real

4221.81 --> 4227.150000000001
and then semantics only red herring the

4225.409 --> 4228.679
[ __ ] out of the situation and that's

4227.15 --> 4229.19
what he's been doing most of the time

4228.679 --> 4231.53
with it

4229.19 --> 4234.53
attacking character attacking character

4231.53 --> 4237.38
flaws attacking miss assumptions quoting

4234.53 --> 4240.619
a lot not actually delivering on proof

4237.38 --> 4242.6900000000005
with like direct like here is the

4240.619 --> 4250.369
experiment here's independent he's never

4242.69 --> 4252.44
done that okay properly so yeah I'm kind

4250.369 --> 4254.509999999999
of disappointed I'd hope that he'd be

4252.44 --> 4257.178999999999
more open-minded and just like be like

4254.51 --> 4260.63
okay well you finally entered this

4257.179 --> 4262.429
ground I've studied for this let's just

4260.63 --> 4264.139
see what everybody does and the

4262.429 --> 4266.659
reasoning and I'll have my stand point

4264.139 --> 4268.88
and I'm confident enough as quantum

4266.659 --> 4271.5199999999995
eraser having studied this for so long

4268.88 --> 4273.42
that yeah they'll just go through

4271.52 --> 4275.580000000001
similar trains of thought and

4273.42 --> 4278.7300000000005
just calmly point out when they're going

4275.58 --> 4281.4
wrong and but he seems to be very

4278.73 --> 4291.15
personally invested in his side of the

4281.4 --> 4293.21
opinion that's just seems like from

4291.15 --> 4295.5
Nathan Oakley show because of all the

4293.21 --> 4297.75
aggressivity the only aggro that that

4295.5 --> 4299.52
you had on there and so I've always

4297.75 --> 4303.27
listened sometimes ten minutes maybe

4299.52 --> 4307.080000000001
half an hour and then moved on but in

4303.27 --> 4308.55
this case I think what they're doing is

4307.08 --> 4310.59
dangerous because they've drawn the

4308.55 --> 4313.05
right attention by destroying the globe

4310.59 --> 4318.150000000001
but at the same time but giving people

4313.05 --> 4321.09
the obligation of the pragmatic evidence

4318.15 --> 4324.299999999999
for everything it's impossible to start

4321.09 --> 4332.04
building even a beginning of a model

4324.3 --> 4348.150000000001
that's my problem did you say Marvel why

4332.04 --> 4351.15
would we need to build a model a model

4348.15 --> 4353.67
is a guidance system to kind of help you

4351.15 --> 4357.9
conceptualize data into one giant

4353.67 --> 4377.16
framework with presupposition agree that

4357.9 --> 4378.719999999999
is with whatever means you you want to

4377.16 --> 4381.51
reproduce it and then you'll be able to

4378.72 --> 4382.29
have an indication on that very specific

4381.51 --> 4384.780000000001
set of data

4382.29 --> 4386.7
oh that very specific set of variables

4384.78 --> 4391.05
you're looking at and it's only a

4386.7 --> 4393.0
reduced vision of reality but I think

4391.05 --> 4395.13
that we've been kept in the ignorance

4393.0 --> 4397.34
and then the endurance of the

4395.13 --> 4400.92
understanding of Earth because of this

4397.34 --> 4404.07
binding us to the pragmatic evidence are

4400.92 --> 4407.369
we are we live here or not now we're

4404.07 --> 4409.648999999999
live now I'm putting myself on mute

4407.369 --> 4413.669
because otherwise we hear the echo on

4409.649 --> 4416.339
constantly so this burden of proof of

4413.669 --> 4418.669
always having the need of the pragmatic

4416.339 --> 4420.78
evidence I think that's a fallacy

4418.669 --> 4422.789
because like I'm trying I'm trying to

4420.78 --> 4426.78
explain on online and then I got

4422.789 --> 4428.879
interrupt a hundred thousand times I can

4426.78 --> 4430.679
have certainties without bringing any

4428.879 --> 4432.479
pragmatic evidence I can build up

4430.679 --> 4433.769
certainties without having any pragmatic

4432.479 --> 4436.979
evidence and they're as good as

4433.769 --> 4442.459
pragmatic evidence and in fact the idea

4436.979 --> 4445.919
is to have several type of evidence

4442.459 --> 4449.219
cross referencing each other if they all

4445.919 --> 4451.3189999999995
cross the same path then you may more or

4449.219 --> 4453.149
less be sure that you are actually on

4451.319 --> 4455.429
the right path and if you have an

4453.149 --> 4458.639
empirical evidence on top is even better

4455.429 --> 4460.9490000000005
but also the empirical evidence per se

4458.639 --> 4463.559
doesn't prove much without the right

4460.949 --> 4465.299999999999
context and that's why we've been played

4463.559 --> 4467.729
with a lot of party trick with a lot of

4465.3 --> 4470.609
parlor tricks we're all loop the plane

4467.729 --> 4472.9490000000005
the boat goes behind the horizon all the

4470.609 --> 4476.519
EE let us experiment in my view that's

4472.949 --> 4481.138999999999
also a big fallacy it's Lele knows

4476.519 --> 4484.079000000001
nothing what do you mean what it's just

4481.139 --> 4486.209
it just shows a phenomena and then

4484.079 --> 4489.389
quantum mechanics interpret that

4486.209 --> 4491.309
phenomena based on presupposition of

4489.389 --> 4496.519
particles of light that are indivisible

4491.309 --> 4496.519
and have speeds and then do weird things

4496.939 --> 4502.919
because that's that's the that's the

4499.679 --> 4505.559
core that's a core the entire science

4502.919 --> 4524.879
thinking it's a science culture particle

4505.559 --> 4526.139
ization use for the modeling just the

4524.879 --> 4528.539
reduction of reality not a

4526.139 --> 4531.629
representation of reality so when you

4528.539 --> 4534.3589999999995
represent an atom with easy-easy

4531.629 --> 4536.939
is electron going around it it's because

4534.359 --> 4539.339
it's easier to visualize but in fact

4536.939 --> 4542.539000000001
those electrons are not physical

4539.339 --> 4542.539
particles they're spikes

4542.99 --> 4550.349999999999
like spikes right is there's a

4547.62 --> 4553.59
connection and then at some point the

4550.35 --> 4556.9800000000005
energy within that connection reaches a

4553.59 --> 4559.95
certain threshold when it actually

4556.98 --> 4562.5
becomes registerable in a material sense

4559.95 --> 4566.22
and that's how they that's how they

4562.5 --> 4569.04
conclude oh look is we register it it's

4566.22 --> 4572.25
a blip so it must be a particle but it's

4569.04 --> 4574.44
only the thresholds for the energy to

4572.25 --> 4583.08
give some kind of result through a

4574.44 --> 4585.66
material medium you have to be very

4583.08 --> 4588.69
lucky if you if you nail it within the

4585.66 --> 4590.01
wrong model I think in the globe they've

4588.69 --> 4592.83
got very little they are they've

4590.01 --> 4594.87
actually nailed because it's um it's all

4592.83 --> 4596.1
upside down it's all it's all in the

4594.87 --> 4597.39
wrong way I mean I don't understand the

4596.1 --> 4598.5
electricity because that's something I'm

4597.39 --> 4601.89
looking into it that's it's very

4598.5 --> 4606.51
interesting but it looks like we are

4601.89 --> 4608.55
looking at one corpus as one thing that

4606.51 --> 4610.17
works in different vectors and the

4608.55 --> 4612.900000000001
equation is much more complicated that

4610.17 --> 4614.76
the inverse of the square there are

4612.9 --> 4617.509999999999
elements we are we have taken off the

4614.76 --> 4619.59
equation for some reason and I've been

4617.51 --> 4622.59
reinserted through the gravitational

4619.59 --> 4624.6900000000005
constant which wasn't calculated I think

4622.59 --> 4628.62
it was made up because they are to

4624.69 --> 4632.16
reflect the it's a reverse engineering

4628.62 --> 4634.71
of the phenomena of gravity actually

4632.16 --> 4636.33
that we can't explain so starting from

4634.71 --> 4639.0
there looking at the Coulomb constant

4636.33 --> 4641.28
which has exactly the same mechanics but

4639.0 --> 4643.98
a different constant and then takes into

4641.28 --> 4645.719999999999
account the masses I don't understand

4643.98 --> 4649.889999999999
why we haven't worked on that Coulomb

4645.72 --> 4653.1
come on that Coulomb electrostatic part

4649.89 --> 4654.900000000001
of of electricity to try to figure out

4653.1 --> 4656.7300000000005
gravity because that's what gives the

4654.9 --> 4658.349999999999
biggest hint about gravity

4656.73 --> 4663.87
there is nothing in mass that gives any

4658.35 --> 4667.59
int about gravity okay oh yeah yeah

4663.87 --> 4669.33
that's kind of new to be so interesting

4667.59 --> 4673.219
you think there is some kind of

4669.33 --> 4677.53
potential proof way to prove gravity

4673.219 --> 4680.81
through electricity the thing is that

4677.53 --> 4684.11
electricity seems to be made of two

4680.81 --> 4686.150000000001
things one is electromagnetic and the

4684.11 --> 4688.4
other one is what they call dielectric

4686.15 --> 4691.099999999999
and and and they probably know even two

4688.4 --> 4709.46
different things they are two different

4691.1 --> 4711.17
states of the field in fact I think

4709.46 --> 4713.81
everybody's wrong or everybody's right

4711.17 --> 4715.82
because I see good things in every

4713.81 --> 4720.38
single theory but I also see things

4715.82 --> 4723.41
which are totally untrue and impossible

4720.38 --> 4726.86
so in the case of the particles and the

4723.41 --> 4729.71
waves what is the discussion I mean you

4726.86 --> 4732.23
cannot say it's a wave the wave it's a

4729.71 --> 4734.18
it's a way of quantifying a certain

4732.23 --> 4736.73
property of what you are observing and

4734.18 --> 4738.14
if it turns out to be a wave because

4736.73 --> 4740.718999999999
when you put it in a graph it looks like

4738.14 --> 4742.969
a wave what does it mean saying light is

4740.719 --> 4746.06
a wave it's one of its aspects is the

4742.969 --> 4750.56
one that we can measure but it doesn't

4746.06 --> 4754.1900000000005
define light as one of its properties

4750.56 --> 4756.110000000001
he's like no but look at you consider my

4754.19 --> 4759.29
nose then I'm a nose that's that's

4756.11 --> 4762.799999999999
saying the same thing I don't know I

4759.29 --> 4764.239
think that is it really what is a wave

4762.8 --> 4767.54
because I think that light has a

4764.239 --> 4770.03
frequency and frequency to us is

4767.54 --> 4772.85
conceptualized as a wave just like a

4770.03 --> 4775.099999999999
guitar snare being struck is like a wave

4772.85 --> 4778.76
but that doesn't make it like an

4775.1 --> 4782.81
amplitude in a wave an actual motion

4778.76 --> 4786.469
within a medium that that's not the case

4782.81 --> 4789.860000000001
I think it is its own separate energy

4786.469 --> 4798.5
and I don't see any connection where

4789.86 --> 4801.17
speed comes into the picture if it's an

4798.5 --> 4803.27
induction of the field all the way up

4801.17 --> 4804.59
all the way to light but you can have

4803.27 --> 4806.75
different levels of induction and

4804.59 --> 4808.64
different levels of variation

4806.75 --> 4810.68
of certain properties of the field

4808.64 --> 4813.29
that's how radio waves can propagate

4810.68 --> 4815.900000000001
that's how all the different waves can

4813.29 --> 4818.51
can actually move around independently

4815.9 --> 4820.91
from air or not apparently because you

4818.51 --> 4823.01
can have radio waves propagating in a

4820.91 --> 4824.63
vacuum as well if I understand so the

4823.01 --> 4826.31
ether is there whether you want it or

4824.63 --> 4829.82
not you cannot extract me either

4826.31 --> 4834.31
from from a place it's it's it seems

4829.82 --> 4834.3099999999995
like to be the real fabric of space

4834.46 --> 4842.54
sorry that that's a few steps too quick

4838.19 --> 4845.8099999999995
too far for me look at first I'd like to

4842.54 --> 4848.57
see confirmation like really radio waves

4845.81 --> 4851.14
in a vacuum create their own meat I

4848.57 --> 4854.42
heard that radio turns into laser

4851.14 --> 4857.39
something like that it was weird I this

4854.42 --> 4859.52
is all still very vague for me so any

4857.39 --> 4862.67
claims that would then say oh there must

4859.52 --> 4864.4400000000005
be an ether is already like really that

4862.67 --> 4866.66
would mean that there is there's

4864.44 --> 4883.669999999999
physical prove ability there's a

4866.66 --> 4885.62
manipulate ability and all that now you

4883.67 --> 4888.64
don't need them you need a container

4885.62 --> 4888.64
that's not the same thing

4889.09 --> 4895.52
it doesn't have to be a dome it just has

4892.1 --> 4900.26
to be contained it has to be a limited

4895.52 --> 4902.990000000001
amount of volume a limited how the

4900.26 --> 4906.2
atlantean has manifested is another

4902.99 --> 4908.469999999999
matter but there has to be a container

4906.2 --> 4919.67
it doesn't need to be a dome good

4908.47 --> 4923.17
doesn't need to be try to extrapolate

4919.67 --> 4925.91
more truth than we can with just simple

4923.17 --> 4927.53
observation and and and when I was

4925.91 --> 4929.3
mentioning this is just a very good

4927.53 --> 4931.67
fantasy when I was mentioning copper

4929.3 --> 4933.68
it's not so much because I venerate him

4931.67 --> 4935.6
and I and I think everything he says

4933.68 --> 4938.519
he's right that's because he's he's

4935.6 --> 4942.59
thinking invites to

4938.519 --> 4945.780000000001
to a deeper approach of of science when

4942.59 --> 4948.749
we talk about science most of the time

4945.78 --> 4951.509999999999
we talk about an analytical way of

4948.749 --> 4953.039
trying to solve problems and to acquire

4951.51 --> 4956.400000000001
not knowledge because that's what

4953.039 --> 4959.55
science is and an analytical way we'll

4956.4 --> 4961.92
split a problem into smaller problem

4959.55 --> 4963.84
that themselves will be splitted into a

4961.92 --> 4967.01
smaller problem in order to try to

4963.84 --> 4970.7300000000005
understand to the most granular level

4967.01 --> 4976.139
the every single truth that you have

4970.73 --> 4977.699
created by creating more problems em so

4976.139 --> 4979.4400000000005
far science has been doing that very

4977.699 --> 4983.098999999999
well what I think science is unable to

4979.44 --> 4988.71
do properly is to resynthesize all those

4983.099 --> 4991.4400000000005
results into one workable hypothesis let

4988.71 --> 4996.269
me rephrase that for you it's not

4991.44 --> 4999.69
holistic it's a giant mess of symptoms

4996.269 --> 5001.6990000000005
and then a weird dream net to basically

4999.69 --> 5004.879999999999
suggests some kind of unification but

5001.699 --> 5015.079
that is actually based on delusional

5004.88 --> 5017.179
thinking particles at the very top of

5015.079 --> 5019.308999999999
the weak forces what Bohr and Einstein

5017.179 --> 5021.499
were trying to do was to reunify the

5019.309 --> 5023.659000000001
math between the smallest particle and

5021.499 --> 5026.329
the biggest particle we can know what we

5023.659 --> 5029.989
can acquire but it has been proven wrong

5026.329 --> 5032.049999999999
it has been proven wrong since 1919

5029.989 --> 5037.129999999999
thirty to one was boring Stein

5032.05 --> 5039.1990000000005
contention so everything we do now in

5037.13 --> 5040.789
science at least on this side of science

5039.199 --> 5043.039
which is not the commercial side but the

5040.789 --> 5045.259999999999
theoretical side of science is just

5043.039 --> 5047.509999999999
taken in the light of a wrong model

5045.26 --> 5049.519
which has been proven wrong and being

5047.51 --> 5051.860000000001
kept like that and people in the

5049.519 --> 5053.269
ignorance of it because what the media

5051.86 --> 5055.82
don't talk about it you either go and

5053.269 --> 5058.099
study on your own or you learn it

5055.82 --> 5064.119
through your job for many reasons or you

5058.099 --> 5064.119000000001
don't know about it yep

5065.949 --> 5070.839999999999
but that analytical versus synthetical

5068.59 --> 5073.53
is very very very important because

5070.84 --> 5077.679
you've got means of acquiring truth via

5073.53 --> 5080.469
synthetical means and and an instance of

5077.679 --> 5084.85
a tried and tested method to understand

5080.469 --> 5088.54
truth is a blackbox testing are you

5084.85 --> 5093.04
familiar with that what sorry blackbox

5088.54 --> 5098.29
testing I only know a black box in

5093.04 --> 5100.54
reference to airplanes but is when you

5098.29 --> 5102.61
are a software you know that software is

5100.54 --> 5105.91
encrypted and so you don't have access

5102.61 --> 5107.469
to the code so let's say you want to go

5105.91 --> 5110.05
and help a customer because it's got a

5107.469 --> 5112.12
problem with this software but the

5110.05 --> 5114.070000000001
vendor has disappeared okay there is no

5112.12 --> 5116.0199999999995
more vendor we don't have the source

5114.07 --> 5118.21
code we don't know what to do you do

5116.02 --> 5121.27
blackbox testing you input a lot of data

5118.21 --> 5128.05
into the software and then you read the

5121.27 --> 5130.570000000001
output and the correlation between right

5128.05 --> 5132.7300000000005
right I get it it's basically a giant

5130.57 --> 5137.349999999999
trial and error program that accounts

5132.73 --> 5139.54
for what can typically be expected no

5137.35 --> 5142.42
but it is based on what typically could

5139.54 --> 5144.79
be and then it's just tested does it

5142.42 --> 5147.219
respond like that and then figure out

5144.79 --> 5154.57
through trial there the structure of how

5147.219 --> 5158.14
its functioning we'll give you some

5154.57 --> 5163.42
statistical power to infer the internal

5158.14 --> 5166.719
workings of your code that's what it

5163.42 --> 5168.919
technically it would mean sorry there

5166.719 --> 5175.13
again missed that part

5168.919 --> 5179.869
so I'd I actually forgot again what I

5175.13 --> 5181.189
was saying he would give you it would

5179.869 --> 5182.719
give you the mean sorry because I just

5181.189 --> 5198.309
forgot something in the car I need to

5182.719 --> 5202.969
look quickly in the car namely my wallet

5198.309 --> 5204.8
okay that's important to remember before

5202.969 --> 5211.01
it spends the night outside and I find

5204.8 --> 5212.360000000001
out the car is being smashed alright we

5211.01 --> 5218.3
were talking about blackbox testing

5212.36 --> 5221.619
Marconi you draw patterns from the

5218.3 --> 5224.570000000001
output that Patton gives you a

5221.619 --> 5228.739
statistical power that helps you infer

5224.57 --> 5232.07
how your code is on the inside and

5228.739 --> 5233.78
because it's like you said is a trial is

5232.07 --> 5235.579
a trial and error but once you got the

5233.78 --> 5237.949
right result you know what's inside

5235.579 --> 5239.929
because it's admissible it's going to be

5237.949 --> 5242.659
behaving like that a hundred percent of

5239.929 --> 5245.2390000000005
the time you have certainty without

5242.659 --> 5247.938999999999
having access to the code so that's one

5245.239 --> 5250.308999999999
of the ways that you can have access to

5247.939 --> 5254.329000000001
knowledge without having access to

5250.309 --> 5257.570000000001
traumatic data to the actual core of the

5254.329 --> 5259.61
data oh there's another way to explain

5257.57 --> 5263.299999999999
it also and that is that basically

5259.61 --> 5267.228999999999
programming has generally developed in a

5263.3 --> 5270.26
unifying way where things become typical

5267.229 --> 5272.119000000001
standardized and then more is built upon

5270.26 --> 5274.6990000000005
that and then another layer is

5272.119 --> 5278.268999999999
standardized and then more and that way

5274.699 --> 5280.549999999999
it's very easy to just take a library of

5278.269 --> 5282.169
what is typically around and just

5280.55 --> 5284.63
cross-reference it like it's basically

5282.169 --> 5286.459
like does it fit through does that fit

5284.63 --> 5294.86
through and then oh it fits through that

5286.459 --> 5298.459
means it must be this entire system you

5294.86 --> 5300.499
can tell but with a battery of tests

5298.459 --> 5302.989
that he was on crack even if you didn't

5300.499 --> 5305.969
follow protocol if you didn't use

5302.989 --> 5307.919999999999
libel no libel raise even if you did the

5305.969 --> 5311.61
code by himself you'll be able to see

5307.92 --> 5312.929
how the code behaves independently from

5311.61 --> 5315.0599999999995
whether you know the structure of the

5312.929 --> 5317.13
code or not is because you can draw

5315.06 --> 5319.92
patterns we'd give you a statistical

5317.13 --> 5321.659000000001
power to say well this is a function

5319.92 --> 5325.67
that does that because when I do that

5321.659 --> 5328.5599999999995
I've got this output right there

5325.67 --> 5334.29
reflecting upon the result and what it

5328.56 --> 5336.27
must have inevitably generated that yes

5334.29 --> 5337.53
based upon the result you say that's

5336.27 --> 5339.75
going to have to be the log you

5337.53 --> 5341.849
basically you reverse engineer the code

5339.75 --> 5344.28
by looking at the output knowing what

5341.849 --> 5347.88
the input is because you've generated

5344.28 --> 5350.4
the input and another another thing for

5347.88 --> 5353.61
instance the fact that we are talking

5350.4 --> 5355.71
together the fact that you exist I don't

5353.61 --> 5358.23
have I don't need to see your mom and

5355.71 --> 5361.079
dad in bed to know that they slept

5358.23 --> 5362.489
together so I don't have the tangible

5361.079 --> 5364.469
proof I don't have the footage I don't

5362.489 --> 5367.919999999999
have the evidence but because of your

5364.469 --> 5371.969
existence I can infer that they slept

5367.92 --> 5375.0
together that's another way of finding

5371.969 --> 5377.88
things which are unmistakable well

5375.0 --> 5380.52
that's the antecedent principle and some

5377.88 --> 5383.51
things have antecedents so if it is

5380.52 --> 5388.320000000001
there then there are logically deducible

5383.51 --> 5390.81
antecedents to that just like hey it's a

5388.32 --> 5395.4
program that means there's electricity

5390.81 --> 5397.650000000001
involved like that so immediately you

5395.4 --> 5400.23
know it's like oh really there's like

5397.65 --> 5403.17
digital information then there is gonna

5400.23 --> 5404.928999999999
be electricity involved somehow unless

5403.17 --> 5408.389
somebody finds a way to like

5404.929 --> 5410.76
mechanically read laserdiscs like a

5408.389 --> 5415.11
record player somehow without using

5410.76 --> 5417.6900000000005
digital devices but but mostly when

5415.11 --> 5419.4
there's like digital information there

5417.69 --> 5428.07
will be electricity involved

5419.4 --> 5432.03
it's an antecedent really believes in

5428.07 --> 5433.329
quantum mechanics yes his name is John

5432.03 --> 5437.139
by the way

5433.329 --> 5439.36
job right okay so I thought I thought

5437.139 --> 5441.07
his name was just something with it is

5439.36 --> 5443.17
because somebody that looks into Flat

5441.07 --> 5446.259999999999
Earth sooner or later will come across

5443.17 --> 5450.46
the fact that quantum mechanics is the

5446.26 --> 5452.409000000001
same it's part of the same fiction so

5450.46 --> 5462.01
that's not something he's already away

5452.409 --> 5478.409
away - sorry say again I got a bit

5462.01 --> 5482.469
distracted from chip it's the same

5478.409 --> 5485.32
mechanism it's a different field where

5482.469 --> 5488.76
the astronomy is the map the macrocosm

5485.32 --> 5492.4
of the part of the ball based thinking

5488.76 --> 5495.849
presuppositional system so is quantum

5492.4 --> 5499.058999999999
mechanics the attempt to create a ball

5495.849 --> 5501.909000000001
system in this case particles just like

5499.059 --> 5505.869000000001
matter with everything that is not

5501.909 --> 5508.179
matter it's a particle ization so where

5505.869 --> 5510.579
we have the astronomy deals with the

5508.179 --> 5514.389
particle ization of the cosmos the the

5510.579 --> 5516.179
macro cosmos so does quantum physics and

5514.389 --> 5519.96
other related things and Einstein in

5516.179 --> 5522.369
also deals with the micro cosmos

5519.96 --> 5526.05
Einstein II not so much but mostly

5522.369 --> 5526.049999999999
quantum physics and everything related

5528.49 --> 5534.01
[Music]

5531.179 --> 5536.65
the smallest part could be extrapolated

5534.01 --> 5539.2300000000005
into the biggest one and that's why they

5536.65 --> 5541.69
need the planet because obviously the

5539.23 --> 5544.48
intuition after registering those

5541.69 --> 5547.78
dielectric spikes cold electrons was

5544.48 --> 5549.369
that they could be particles but it is

5547.78 --> 5552.19
clear I mean so the double slit

5549.369 --> 5554.409
experiment is tending to prove that

5552.19 --> 5562.039
those are particles in off ways is that

5554.409 --> 5565.129
the reason no no no

5562.039 --> 5567.889
what it does it presupposes that's the

5565.129 --> 5570.26
thing it's a new free supposition what

5567.889 --> 5573.729
quantum mechanics dues does is free

5570.26 --> 5577.399
suppose that light is an indivisible

5573.729 --> 5579.109
particle of light energy that travels a

5577.399 --> 5581.329000000001
speed that's the standard free

5579.109 --> 5583.369000000001
supposition mech mechanics and that's

5581.329 --> 5585.6089999999995
where the amazing mathematical

5583.369 --> 5588.049
extrapolations come from from that

5585.609 --> 5603.859
presupposition so it's a

5588.049 --> 5609.019
presuppositional science context about

5603.859 --> 5611.4490000000005
this as well probably and then he

5609.019 --> 5613.4890000000005
realized that he put so much investment

5611.449 --> 5618.589
into that knowledge he doesn't want to

5613.489 --> 5620.209
risk the long term a function of he

5618.589 --> 5621.979
doesn't want to risk losing the long

5620.209 --> 5624.559
term function of being an arbiter of

5621.979 --> 5628.249000000001
quantum mechanics just like astronomers

5624.559 --> 5630.769
don't that bump into this figure out

5628.249 --> 5639.289
that they don't want to lose their story

5630.769 --> 5641.209
time power C so I don't know exactly

5639.289 --> 5644.268999999999
what he studied I think he did was

5641.209 --> 5662.898999999999
engineering and then he specialized or

5644.269 --> 5666.799
whatever in quantum mechanics no I don't

5662.899 --> 5670.459000000001
know he's pretty well studied in detail

5666.799 --> 5679.76
Norrell knowledge of words I I think

5670.459 --> 5682.188999999999
you're under estimating him in this no

5679.76 --> 5685.579000000001
but but that has nothing to do with his

5682.189 --> 5690.309
skill range it just has to do with this

5685.579 --> 5690.308999999999
his emotional abilities social abilities

5713.38 --> 5722.18
that's interesting but he may simply not

5719.33 --> 5725.12
be certain and just acting that he is

5722.18 --> 5727.490000000001
certain as part of his can I please

5725.12 --> 5728.87
finish my sentence as part of his

5727.49 --> 5732.5599999999995
personal acts

5728.87 --> 5734.54
it's like required for him to uphold the

5732.56 --> 5737.0
confidence in order for his acts of work

5734.54 --> 5739.37
and that's like a person like that's not

5737.0 --> 5743.33
like an official act or a theatrical act

5739.37 --> 5747.099999999999
it's his personal act his attitude the

5743.33 --> 5754.43
format he's taken on as a person

5747.1 --> 5758.84
socially it's it seems to be working for

5754.43 --> 5761.320000000001
him otherwise he would quit or maybe he

5758.84 --> 5764.860000000001
doesn't know any other way to do it

5761.32 --> 5764.86
to handle himself

5770.4 --> 5773.46
[Music]

5777.499 --> 5782.159
he talked to me like he listened to me

5780.209 --> 5785.219
like maybe 10 seconds and then he said

5782.159 --> 5786.869
you've got no scientific acumen doesn't

5785.219 --> 5789.57
know what I did who I am where I come

5786.869 --> 5791.61
from what's my background and so on so

5789.57 --> 5794.789
it's a it could be it could you could be

5791.61 --> 5796.709
condemning yourself in in in very short

5794.789 --> 5798.63
time because if you listen to most of

5796.709 --> 5800.249
the interview I did you can tell that

5798.63 --> 5803.82
you got certain fields of science I know

5800.249 --> 5808.228999999999
kind of inside out all the way to a

5803.82 --> 5812.61
practical commercial aspect of them okay

5808.229 --> 5815.039000000001
what look yeah but look it's very simple

5812.61 --> 5818.4
on the debates when Johnson at some

5815.039 --> 5820.949
point he's gonna go like get he's gonna

5818.4 --> 5823.768999999999
literally ignore it he's just bouncing

5820.949 --> 5826.53
around prancing around that's what he

5823.769 --> 5828.389
does a lot and then he will just scoff

5826.53 --> 5831.199
at people that he doesn't really know or

5828.389 --> 5845.07
doesn't really listen to it does that

5831.199 --> 5848.638999999999
eventually he does that stepping on the

5845.07 --> 5850.53
toes yes it's always the same it's

5848.639 --> 5853.11
stepping on the toes of those things

5850.53 --> 5857.82
that he has invested a lot of his

5853.11 --> 5860.308999999999
personal energy in so if you're gonna

5857.82 --> 5862.739
basically do real the foundations of how

5860.309 --> 5865.34
he conceptualized quantum mechanics and

5862.739 --> 5870.32
what that all is he's gonna get really

5865.34 --> 5870.32
aggressive mentally that's what he does

5881.58 --> 5888.66
are you there sorry I was muted I said I

5886.05 --> 5900.6900000000005
don't know if he has any opinions about

5888.66 --> 5904.58
Tesla I don't know what could be the

5900.69 --> 5907.379999999999
genesis it's just the other angle

5904.58 --> 5910.4
it's the alternative is probably more

5907.38 --> 5917.1900000000005
viable grounds more viable approach more

5910.4 --> 5919.799999999999
grounded in reality but yes because I

5917.19 --> 5925.23
mean from from what it seems Oliver

5919.8 --> 5928.14
Heaviside was very close to to put to

5925.23 --> 5930.9
kick the the ant house and they kicked

5928.14 --> 5933.660000000001
him out of the Royal Society instead but

5930.9 --> 5936.87
all the math he redid and all the math

5933.66 --> 5938.55
Jeffy Manko redid after him in fact

5936.87 --> 5942.09
there was a very interesting document

5938.55 --> 5946.38
I've shared many times on many on many

5942.09 --> 5948.99
streams is the one from actually a Dutch

5946.38 --> 5952.17
guy I think he's a Belgian guy Dutch

5948.99 --> 5955.8
Belgian guy that says they did Einstein

5952.17 --> 5958.02
sheets and and and his contention is

5955.8 --> 5961.5
that Einstein went for the calculation

5958.02 --> 5963.51
he went knowing the result he's like one

5961.5 --> 5965.13
of those one of those magician card

5963.51 --> 5968.13
games it's exactly the same principle

5965.13 --> 5970.83
and I think they've done that everywhere

5968.13 --> 5973.56
you've got the math that work and they

5970.83 --> 5976.44
don't match reality is because they've

5973.56 --> 5981.17
taken the result that reality has and

5976.44 --> 5981.169999999999
they've just passed it through this

5981.59 --> 5990.6900000000005
their machination trash mecca nation

5988.59 --> 5995.1
it's do you understand the concept of a

5990.69 --> 5997.71
machination machination is like a

5995.1 --> 6003.02
construction that is specifically

5997.71 --> 6005.54
designed to like misconceive to

6003.02 --> 6007.790000000001
basically show something manipulates

6005.54 --> 6010.73
something in order to suggest a certain

6007.79 --> 6013.1
pattern that is not real known by the

6010.73 --> 6014.15
Creator you have to know that you're

6013.1 --> 6016.369000000001
doing that otherwise

6014.15 --> 6018.619
you can't make it properly you have to

6016.369 --> 6027.348999999999
know reality in order to make the

6018.619 --> 6029.15
falsification with the machination and

6027.349 --> 6030.889
then you tell the person to take a card

6029.15 --> 6033.289
and then you take another card then

6030.889 --> 6035.599
another card and basically why you tell

6033.289 --> 6037.249
him to take is the card that you saw at

6035.599 --> 6038.719
the beginning and then every time he

6037.249 --> 6041.96
takes a new card you tell you to take

6038.719 --> 6044.15
that card and he's basically choosing

6041.96 --> 6046.039
the card for you instead of you telling

6044.15 --> 6047.36
him what card to take but it looks like

6046.039 --> 6049.219
you are telling him what card to take

6047.36 --> 6050.869
because in the end you tell him well

6049.219 --> 6054.979
then I am going to take this card which

6050.869 --> 6058.518999999999
is the first one you saw oh and in fact

6054.979 --> 6060.38
it's the last one he found and that's it

6058.519 --> 6062.780000000001
but you take the first one you saw and

6060.38 --> 6064.1900000000005
you put it at the bottom and you've got

6062.78 --> 6065.9
your all game and you've got all the

6064.19 --> 6067.94
cards he's picked up and it looks much

6065.9 --> 6070.308999999999
like magic but it's not a magic it's

6067.94 --> 6072.379999999999
truck it's a trick and that's exactly I

6070.309 --> 6080.409000000001
think what they've done both with

6072.38 --> 6080.409000000001
gravity and with with the relationship

6094.239 --> 6100.598999999999
yeah I think I know what you mean they

6097.01 --> 6102.71
they made they use certain operations is

6100.599 --> 6105.639
constructed like gravity is an

6102.71 --> 6109.01
aberration what it practically is is a

6105.639 --> 6111.979
construct that you can presuppose that

6109.01 --> 6115.67
if that were real it would help explain

6111.979 --> 6118.280000000001
a lot of things that we experience and

6115.67 --> 6119.869
even beyond into outer space as it were

6118.28 --> 6121.789
and that's the trick

6119.869 --> 6125.119
so they put something there that

6121.789 --> 6127.28
explains mechanisms in a very easy and

6125.119 --> 6130.219
unified way even though there's no

6127.28 --> 6133.999
actual physical proof for it functioning

6130.219 --> 6137.42
the way it is presupposed like our data

6133.999 --> 6141.59
exists it's just what it should be doing

6137.42 --> 6143.53
can be derived from things but to

6141.59 --> 6146.389
actually prove that it is something

6143.53 --> 6147.099999999999
that's that's impossible that makes that

6146.389 --> 6149.68
makes it enough

6147.1 --> 6153.43
raishin is just a trick to heavily

6149.68 --> 6155.92
suggest a certain setup well yeah if you

6153.43 --> 6158.4400000000005
get meticulous then you can back

6155.92 --> 6160.4800000000005
engineer all these elements and figure

6158.44 --> 6163.5599999999995
out that there's actually provable

6160.48 --> 6167.049999999999
things causing that instead of gravity

6163.56 --> 6170.17
like relative density the relative

6167.05 --> 6172.54
density disequilibrium causes objects of

6170.17 --> 6174.01
whatever density to displace in the

6172.54 --> 6176.05
direction of the relative density

6174.01 --> 6180.22
equilibrium point of that object in

6176.05 --> 6181.75
relation to its medium and that is all

6180.22 --> 6183.88
provable and then you get the whole

6181.75 --> 6188.26
structure instead of gravity you can

6183.88 --> 6190.21
even explain a freefall scenarios with

6188.26 --> 6193.27
it how the relative density effect is

6190.21 --> 6198.87
canceled through the yeah the constant

6193.27 --> 6198.870000000001
is the actual displacement and all that

6198.9 --> 6206.799999999999
right how can the relative density

6202.3 --> 6210.16
effect be suspended it can be if the

6206.8 --> 6214.54
whole thing is actually in motion at a

6210.16 --> 6217.48
certain rate again that is a heavy heavy

6214.54 --> 6220.3
heavy heavy suggestion that there is

6217.48 --> 6223.0599999999995
like a constant apparent force

6220.3 --> 6225.55
disequilibrium downwards which would

6223.06 --> 6230.34
then be neutralized with the forces as

6225.55 --> 6234.820000000001
you dive but in actuality that that

6230.34 --> 6236.860000000001
doesn't match up as well it does work

6234.82 --> 6240.49
like that but you have to presuppose it

6236.86 --> 6243.28
again the gravity but if you then very

6240.49 --> 6245.889999999999
carefully work out the relative density

6243.28 --> 6252.45
theory as I have then you can eventually

6245.89 --> 6255.450000000001
figure out that you can explain the

6252.45 --> 6255.45
effects

6255.84 --> 6262.6900000000005
what you said it's about the word

6258.94 --> 6267.12
gravity as much about the word model as

6262.69 --> 6271.449
much about the word science God theory

6267.12 --> 6275.969
hypothesis and all those words we we all

6271.449 --> 6278.71
use the same tag for those words so that

6275.969 --> 6281.71
what I say in English the word I say in

6278.71 --> 6284.56
English is identical to yours but is it

6281.71 --> 6286.96
identical in the concept I have of it

6284.56 --> 6288.580000000001
when we talk about it because when we

6286.96 --> 6290.44
talk about God and God is the perfect

6288.58 --> 6291.61
example that we can talk about it all

6290.44 --> 6295.15
day and you talk about one thing they

6291.61 --> 6297.19
talk about the other right and the same

6295.15 --> 6300.3099999999995
for science and the same for theory and

6297.19 --> 6303.879999999999
the same for model and gravity I think

6300.31 --> 6306.25
there is a gravity it's not just what

6303.88 --> 6308.14
they say it is and it's absolutely not

6306.25 --> 6310.48
reduced to what they say it is I think

6308.14 --> 6313.660000000001
it has to do with mass because mass is a

6310.48 --> 6316.629999999999
direct will be a direct responsible for

6313.66 --> 6320.469
a certain amount of charge and and when

6316.63 --> 6322.6
they say okay natural laws natural laws

6320.469 --> 6325.51
what do we know that outside of the

6322.6 --> 6327.79
field of action or of the earth things

6325.51 --> 6330.34
move and behave the same way on earth

6327.79 --> 6332.739
then on earth you see so you cannot

6330.34 --> 6335.26
first of all extrapolate universal laws

6332.739 --> 6340.5599999999995
from what you can observe on earth first

6335.26 --> 6344.35
of all but you can totally see why not

6340.56 --> 6346.4400000000005
why not why can't you the derived

6344.35 --> 6349.929
natural laws from what you experience

6346.44 --> 6352.66
you can it that's kind of like how it

6349.929 --> 6368.83
works right natural laws you have to

6352.66 --> 6370.84
disprove them otherwise if you can there

6368.83 --> 6374.65
is no proof there is anything else than

6370.84 --> 6377.08
earth so how is that relevant if earth

6374.65 --> 6379.839999999999
is the only existence physically then

6377.08 --> 6383.7699999999995
why would you even say only on earth

6379.84 --> 6386.05
it's just when it's real if it's not on

6383.77 --> 6387.92
earth if we imagine it yeah something we

6386.05 --> 6410.09
imagine is of course not real

6387.92 --> 6413.96
so right right just like how they

6410.09 --> 6416.54
measure how they derive what material

6413.96 --> 6420.14
the Sun must be made of by analyzing the

6416.54 --> 6423.05
light and then in the color spectrum see

6420.14 --> 6426.320000000001
oh look this light color spectrum

6423.05 --> 6429.8
typically relates with this type of

6426.32 --> 6432.32
matter in our spectral analysis and then

6429.8 --> 6434.39
so then they draw a conclusion look

6432.32 --> 6437.0599999999995
because our spectral analysis of the

6434.39 --> 6439.39
matter we tested on earth has revealed

6437.06 --> 6443.06
that this results of these materials

6439.39 --> 6444.92
based on that scale of material testing

6443.06 --> 6446.3
we are going to draw the conclusion that

6444.92 --> 6447.77
the material because of the light

6446.3 --> 6450.79
spectrum that we are getting from that

6447.77 --> 6460.1900000000005
must be containing these materials

6450.79 --> 6463.03
that's one of those things and in my

6460.19 --> 6467.12
view after so many years of science of

6463.03 --> 6469.639999999999
analytical science we have all the parts

6467.12 --> 6472.04
of the puzzle in front of us they are

6469.64 --> 6475.34
actually there we just if we look at

6472.04 --> 6479.66
them we do not see them it's incredible

6475.34 --> 6482.59
oh yeah you're talking about the general

6479.66 --> 6482.59
public now right

6485.73 --> 6492.3099999999995
when it was told to me and I was already

6489.37 --> 6495.13
on to something else but but in the same

6492.31 --> 6497.64
in the same optics which was to take

6495.13 --> 6500.9400000000005
experiments we already have on earth and

6497.64 --> 6504.400000000001
match them to what we see in the

6500.94 --> 6507.549999999999
celestial mechanics and in the way

6504.4 --> 6510.37
everything works and the very first step

6507.55 --> 6512.71
is to erase everything you know and to

6510.37 --> 6514.33
work in a fully pretend model you say

6512.71 --> 6515.83
okay let's pretend like you do in

6514.33 --> 6518.65
translation when you don't know

6515.83 --> 6531.969
something you pretend okay so let's say

6518.65 --> 6533.679
it means that does it work they're still

6531.969 --> 6535.33
not confident look it's still just a

6533.679 --> 6537.85
game it's still based on the

6535.33 --> 6542.32
presuppositions until it's being

6537.85 --> 6545.08
confirmed I mean if you're gonna compare

6542.32 --> 6547.33
the mechanics of what you see and then

6545.08 --> 6550.2699999999995
assuming that those are literal physical

6547.33 --> 6552.55
places that you can build and test and

6550.27 --> 6555.85
compare all these things but there is no

6552.55 --> 6560.6990000000005
confirmation really so it will remain

6555.85 --> 6560.6990000000005
all presuppositional derived from

6573.0 --> 6579.61
right so when you presuppose that light

6577.15 --> 6583.45
you're measuring from up there must be

6579.61 --> 6587.049999999999
from some kind of literal lamp ball in a

6583.45 --> 6589.92
vacuum then you could analyze that light

6587.05 --> 6593.2300000000005
spectrum in order to get the material

6589.92 --> 6602.59
from it that's a presupposition no but

6593.23 --> 6609.969999999999
it is that is a presupposition because I

6602.59 --> 6613.42
know what I'm saying so I know the idea

6609.97 --> 6616.93
is that I want to tackle things from a

6613.42 --> 6621.15
synthetic off side now when you

6616.93 --> 6624.64
presuppose the nature of an effect you

6621.15 --> 6627.879999999999
you are indeed lying of your own deep

6624.64 --> 6631.150000000001
guessing but when you take a known

6627.88 --> 6633.64
effect for which you already know the

6631.15 --> 6637.15
nature of the effect or at least in the

6633.64 --> 6639.97
broad lines at least it does repeat

6637.15 --> 6642.82
repeatability on his side which is not

6639.97 --> 6645.64
the case of anything in the relativistic

6642.82 --> 6647.799999999999
theory oh the only thing repeatable is

6645.64 --> 6649.6
the max yeah you don't have anything

6647.8 --> 6652.6900000000005
empirical in what I'm putting forward

6649.6 --> 6655.150000000001
you've got empirical evidence that the

6652.69 --> 6659.29
effect exists and the known the cause is

6655.15 --> 6659.589999999999
known and the two effects I'm talking

6659.29 --> 6662.98
about

6659.59 --> 6665.47
or rather it's free effects one and I'm

6662.98 --> 6667.0
talking this from a macro approach so

6665.47 --> 6670.41
I'm not analyzing anything I'm

6667.0 --> 6674.59
synthesizing did you see the difference

6670.41 --> 6677.8
okay I'm having trouble following but

6674.59 --> 6680.74
just say what you once not guessing it's

6677.8 --> 6683.26
not guessing it's inferring from synth

6680.74 --> 6685.54
from synthesis let me let me let me walk

6683.26 --> 6690.439
you through it if I may

6685.54 --> 6694.11
[Music]

6690.439 --> 6696.42
okay let's pretend the word is electric

6694.11 --> 6698.13
okay let's start from the middle and the

6696.42 --> 6700.86
word is electric let's pretend

6698.13 --> 6702.63
everything is run by electricity it

6700.86 --> 6704.909
might not be true but let's pretend for

6702.63 --> 6708.36
the sake of discussion what are the

6704.909 --> 6711.03
electrical effects we know that we can

6708.36 --> 6712.018999999999
witness that we have experience here on

6711.03 --> 6715.11
earth

6712.019 --> 6718.019
we've got magnetism which attracts

6715.11 --> 6721.38
ferrous material we've got electro

6718.019 --> 6724.59
statisti which is very strange it Pyke's

6721.38 --> 6726.059
it's high voltage low amperage but it

6724.59 --> 6731.09
does attract things as well you know

6726.059 --> 6738.869000000001
that statics attracts things don't you

6731.09 --> 6741.869000000001
yes continue okay we've got effects like

6738.869 --> 6744.688999999999
batteries that can store electricity but

6741.869 --> 6748.639
we also have effect where we can

6744.689 --> 6751.92
generate electricity from specific

6748.639 --> 6754.829
activities we've got effects where we've

6751.92 --> 6757.28
got heating which is the output of

6754.829 --> 6760.978999999999
electricity we've got effects what

6757.28 --> 6764.728999999999
you're assuming that now that heat is

6760.979 --> 6773.070000000001
electrical in nature it's part of the

6764.729 --> 6775.34
presupposition that you are doing yeah

6773.07 --> 6778.17
that doesn't make all heat electricity

6775.34 --> 6780.119000000001
that's just saying like that's just like

6778.17 --> 6782.6990000000005
saying what's Persky modeling that is

6780.119 --> 6784.259999999999
that oh look there when there's the

6782.699 --> 6802.11
pressure is not there because it's only

6784.26 --> 6804.809
heat exchange side effects okay thought

6802.11 --> 6809.728999999999
you were attributing heat itself as

6804.809 --> 6810.570000000001
electrical so okay it creates heat sure

6809.729 --> 6820.019
let's go with that

6810.57 --> 6821.13
continue it creates heat get it can also

6820.019 --> 6831.6900000000005
create

6821.13 --> 6833.55
effects Oh like you know what we used to

6831.69 --> 6836.549999999999
cool them down with the passive cooling

6833.55 --> 6840.87
which is a Peltier effect its inverse

6836.55 --> 6842.9400000000005
polarity separated by a material Wow

6840.87 --> 6844.8
never heard of that interesting one of

6842.94 --> 6848.49
the side goes hot and the other one of

6844.8 --> 6850.110000000001
the side yes I know because it's not

6848.49 --> 6851.67
something which is very known but it's

6850.11 --> 6853.589999999999
one of the effects of electricity and

6851.67 --> 6856.26
actually Tesla also has an effect which

6853.59 --> 6860.72
is which has a cooling property and an

6856.26 --> 6862.92
an endothermic property as much as any

6860.72 --> 6865.02
electricity can have exothermic

6862.92 --> 6868.05
properties you can have endothermic

6865.02 --> 6873.870000000001
properties so it can have attractive

6868.05 --> 6877.53
properties magnetic electrostatic it can

6873.87 --> 6879.42
cool it can it can be stored it can be

6877.53 --> 6882.75
generated according to certain methods

6879.42 --> 6887.28
all those effects are effect we could

6882.75 --> 6890.43
witness on earth now you'll say ok

6887.28 --> 6892.91
randomly ok you've got one effect but

6890.43 --> 6895.8
all the effects can be actually

6892.91 --> 6898.5599999999995
reproduced and much to what we can see

6895.8 --> 6901.110000000001
on earth right so do you still remember

6898.56 --> 6910.02
the or the original angle to this entire

6901.11 --> 6912.8099999999995
story yes so you got it like me there's

6910.02 --> 6923.21
a lot relating to electricity so what is

6912.81 --> 6928.950000000001
the conclusion okay okay continue

6923.21 --> 6931.11
continue so do you remember when I said

6928.95 --> 6938.12
we we can witness an effect that

6931.11 --> 6938.12
generates electricity no a very simple

6940.1 --> 6944.55
metal plate any plate the one you do

6942.63 --> 6948.54
cookies in you know those throwaway

6944.55 --> 6953.49
plates you put some salty water in there

6948.54 --> 6954.63
and then with a bit of paper to separate

6953.49 --> 6957.679999999999
it so that it

6954.63 --> 6962.82
the moist you put salty water and an

6957.68 --> 6965.22
activated charcoal now activated

6962.82 --> 6967.549999999999
charcoal charcoal is what you have on

6965.22 --> 6971.6
earth basically sweat earth is made of

6967.55 --> 6974.28
so if you put charcoal into salty water

6971.6 --> 6976.410000000001
you Arvind a node at the bottom a

6974.28 --> 6981.11
cathode at the top or inversely doesn't

6976.41 --> 6984.11
matter it will output electricity huh

6981.11 --> 6984.11
okay

6984.41 --> 6990.63
wife experiments a little with

6987.12 --> 6993.21
electrical generating thingies but I did

6990.63 --> 7001.07
know that charcoal that that set up food

6993.21 --> 7003.83
yields water and you can actually I mean

7001.07 --> 7008.469999999999
a small little plate of ten centimeters

7003.83 --> 7018.68
diameter you can generate a thing point

7008.47 --> 7021.71
two volts okay but beside the volts what

7018.68 --> 7023.360000000001
how much is actually is actually

7021.71 --> 7050.3
generated because there's a tension

7023.36 --> 7051.98
field going on so what is the dome you

7050.3 --> 7054.95
already have an antecedent because of

7051.98 --> 7061.94
pressure but no you're doing it again

7054.95 --> 7062.78
no dome a container is not the same I'm

7061.94 --> 7068.9
not doing it again

7062.78 --> 7071.389999999999
I'm not in your in your cult excuse me

7068.9 --> 7074.29
you're claiming a dome so have you any

7071.39 --> 7074.29
physical proof

7084.989 --> 7090.909
okay well go ahead but then please stop

7087.85 --> 7093.55
asking me questions okay I mean it do

7090.909 --> 7095.0199999999995
your presentation entirely don't ask me

7093.55 --> 7097.03
questions I'm just gonna say yes to

7095.02 --> 7098.77
everything you can assume that and then

7097.03 --> 7100.42
I'm not gonna stay on mute because

7098.77 --> 7112.21
otherwise the sound is gonna keep on

7100.42 --> 7114.07
sucking and echoing so please if there

7112.21 --> 7119.13
is an issue about something that I don't

7114.07 --> 7119.13
know I will interrupt you and ask okay

7121.08 --> 7127.12
electricity simply with salty water in

7124.09 --> 7129.55
contact with activated charcoal and both

7127.12 --> 7131.86
things are undeniably what make both the

7129.55 --> 7135.159000000001
oceans and earth so you've got you the

7131.86 --> 7137.83
generation of electricity is there an

7135.159 --> 7139.42
efficient way of storing electricity or

7137.83 --> 7142.21
is there a way of storing actually

7139.42 --> 7144.46
electrostatics there is one in a Van de

7142.21 --> 7146.86
Graaff generator which is a sphere and

7144.46 --> 7148.3
that traps the electrostatic that goes

7146.86 --> 7149.86
up I don't need to explain because

7148.3 --> 7152.29
you're not asking about it if you don't

7149.86 --> 7154.049999999999
know what it is ask me and it's a sphere

7152.29 --> 7156.639
it's a metallic sphere it's those

7154.05 --> 7160.4490000000005
electro static electricity electro stuff

7156.639 --> 7162.400000000001
yes I've seen that good stuff so if we

7160.449 --> 7164.678999999999
pretend there is a dome let's just

7162.4 --> 7168.67
pretend there is a dome let's just

7164.679 --> 7169.929
pretend the Bible doesn't only say now

7168.67 --> 7173.889
don't go there

7169.929 --> 7177.6
there's dome no firmament not dome so

7173.889 --> 7180.429
but yeah yes go with the dome and know

7177.6 --> 7181.719
you stopped me before I could speak when

7180.429 --> 7183.7300000000005
I mentioned the Bible II was it

7181.719 --> 7186.01
regarding the firmament or the dome he

7183.73 --> 7190.78
was regarding the quotation as above so

7186.01 --> 7193.360000000001
below if I want to pretend there is a

7190.78 --> 7195.969
dome above and I want to pretend there

7193.36 --> 7201.82
is a dome below because what I need is

7195.969 --> 7206.65
to inverse polarity separated by Argyl

7201.82 --> 7208.2699999999995
oh really because the it's it's if I

7206.65 --> 7210.599999999999
remember well in the Peltier effect is

7208.27 --> 7213.639
several different metals together and

7210.6 --> 7216.429
Earth is also made of metal so if you

7213.639 --> 7218.76
separate the two half spheres the two

7216.429 --> 7223.329
half dome of my pretended

7218.76 --> 7225.610000000001
my crackpot hypothesis you separated the

7223.329 --> 7227.59
two poles you could have a Peltier

7225.61 --> 7230.049999999999
effect actually with two half domes one

7227.59 --> 7234.6990000000005
up one at the bottom I've only ever seen

7230.05 --> 7238.3
the Peltier effect with with slides with

7234.699 --> 7240.669999999999
with with planks with all you see with

7238.3 --> 7243.479
rectangles never with a sphere but it

7240.67 --> 7247.03
could be what did you say

7243.479 --> 7250.860000000001
rectangles I like that continued the

7247.03 --> 7254.139
Peltier effect is it's a slab of metal

7250.86 --> 7258.579
with with something in between it's like

7254.139 --> 7261.4890000000005
a Bilaam it's like it's like a

7258.579 --> 7263.53
thermostat but you've got inverse

7261.489 --> 7267.909
polarity on the two sides and in between

7263.53 --> 7269.679
you've got something which which

7267.909 --> 7271.239
separates the two polarities one creates

7269.679 --> 7273.03
cold one creates hot I don't know how to

7271.239 --> 7277.259999999999
explain that better than that in English

7273.03 --> 7281.59
all right if you turn those to half

7277.26 --> 7283.900000000001
those two plates

7281.59 --> 7285.610000000001
it's plates that's the word those two

7283.9 --> 7288.938999999999
metal plates if you turn them into two

7285.61 --> 7290.259999999999
semi spheres you put them together and

7288.939 --> 7292.780000000001
you put this thing in the middle which

7290.26 --> 7294.459
would be the flat earth what kind of

7292.78 --> 7299.17
effect you would have knowing that the

7294.459 --> 7301.389
flat earth would create electricity frul

7299.17 --> 7304.51
electricity means electromagnetic and

7301.389 --> 7306.67
static and what can what would be the

7304.51 --> 7308.8
output the cathode the anodes is there a

7306.67 --> 7310.84
cyclical you need to put the magnet in

7308.8 --> 7313.329000000001
between in the in the very middle of

7310.84 --> 7315.67
your sphere so we could be in between a

7313.329 --> 7317.829
sphere in between two domes inside the

7315.67 --> 7320.079
sphere on a flat earth so everybody's

7317.829 --> 7325.268999999999
right it's concave is spherical and it's

7320.079 --> 7327.88
flat that's it right but that's all

7325.269 --> 7330.909000000001
based on it but I really like the

7327.88 --> 7332.439
concept I've heard it before I think I

7330.909 --> 7335.219
like it but it is highly

7332.439 --> 7338.92
presuppositional and extremely bound to

7335.219 --> 7340.9890000000005
physical spatial literalism so

7338.92 --> 7343.329
everything has to be a physical literal

7340.989 --> 7346.089999999999
object in that sense including the

7343.329 --> 7350.768999999999
container of the realm and all that and

7346.09 --> 7352.58
then yeah who knows it's interesting yes

7350.769 --> 7355.22
of course that's

7352.58 --> 7362.78
now all we need is that evening has the

7355.22 --> 7372.110000000001
same problems that we expect it could

7362.78 --> 7376.3099999999995
have to be physical really that's all

7372.11 --> 7378.589999999999
still physical it has to be something

7376.31 --> 7380.660000000001
physical in order for that effect to be

7378.59 --> 7384.59
able to occur you can demonstrate that

7380.66 --> 7387.68
effect you just said not using something

7384.59 --> 7394.04
physical it's very simple that's what

7387.68 --> 7395.8
makes it no if you're trying to emulate

7394.04 --> 7399.74
this setup that you were basically

7395.8 --> 7401.78
suggesting as suggesting the specific

7399.74 --> 7404.69
electrical effect you can only

7401.78 --> 7407.719999999999
demonstrate that with a physical setup

7404.69 --> 7409.969999999999
so if you're gonna assume the world is

7407.72 --> 7413.42
that physical setup then there must be

7409.97 --> 7420.14
the physical elements there otherwise

7413.42 --> 7421.07
yeah it couldn't work there's nothing

7420.14 --> 7425.18
wrong with it

7421.07 --> 7427.4
but but the fact that it must be there

7425.18 --> 7455.150000000001
in order for the effect to even occur to

7427.4 --> 7459.799999999999
be possible to metals of sand of Earth

7455.15 --> 7463.129999999999
and charcoal bathing in a sea of salty

7459.8 --> 7465.95
water I mean it would be odd that the

7463.13 --> 7469.78
effect didn't didn't reproduce it would

7465.95 --> 7469.78
be difficult that it didn't happen right

7482.139 --> 7487.25
right but on the other hand now I'm

7485.42 --> 7490.13
gonna get to a piece of criticism on

7487.25 --> 7491.81
this entire set up I like the idea but I

7490.13 --> 7493.76
especially like when you actually

7491.81 --> 7497.4800000000005
brought forth the concept of rectangular

7493.76 --> 7500.42
plates you know why because I think that

7497.48 --> 7503.199
may actually be the real world set up

7500.42 --> 7510.7390000000005
not a dome not some freakin sphere no

7503.199 --> 7513.23
plates flat all of it flat a soup in

7510.739 --> 7516.44
between plates and how big that plate is

7513.23 --> 7520.098999999999
if the plate even has a literal size or

7516.44 --> 7523.489
is just looping in its nature but the

7520.099 --> 7528.67
plates and a rectangular total medium

7523.489 --> 7528.669999999999
that would make sense to me really a lot

7528.94 --> 7541.54
I'm talking about the entirety of the

7531.949 --> 7563.509999999999
physical realm it would be plates yes

7541.54 --> 7566.63
apparently yes yes taking away the

7563.51 --> 7569.59
presupposition of a North Pole centric

7566.63 --> 7569.59
worldview

7573.019 --> 7577.76
because I think that is presupposed just

7575.719 --> 7580.57
like I figured out that the particle

7577.76 --> 7584.09
nature in quantum mechanics was probably

7580.57 --> 7587.599
presupposed thus way before I figured

7584.09 --> 7590.599
out wait all this North Pole centric the

7587.599 --> 7593.059
disk the globe all the map projections

7590.599 --> 7595.249
is always some kind of circle what if

7593.059 --> 7597.860000000001
that is a presupposition in itself since

7595.249 --> 7600.079
a circle is kind of like the first thing

7597.86 --> 7604.13
in the geometrical sense that gets close

7600.079 --> 7604.82
to a sphere so what if that all was just

7604.13 --> 7609.4890000000005
nonsense

7604.82 --> 7609.489
and it's actually rectangular looping I

7609.88 --> 7616.329
almost got a model I almost made a model

7612.92 --> 7616.329
out of it it's just really surreal

7624.099 --> 7630.9490000000005
well what about well it's not direct

7628.369 --> 7634.28
hunches but for example if the earth was

7630.949 --> 7636.169999999999
a disc if we assume that is an aspect of

7634.28 --> 7640.449
a model of the world and that's real

7636.17 --> 7645.1990000000005
then if you move past the equator you

7640.449 --> 7650.69
must be geometrically spatially moving

7645.199 --> 7653.449
in a confirmed measurable circle what if

7650.69 --> 7657.169999999999
that is just not the case the slightest

7653.449 --> 7660.259999999999
then then if this equator is a straight

7657.17 --> 7663.11
line if the practical actual location of

7660.26 --> 7664.909000000001
where the equator is derived to be in

7663.11 --> 7667.489
accordance to the celestial bodies which

7664.909 --> 7670.518999999999
is how it is determined if that turns

7667.489 --> 7676.03
out to be a straight line then it can

7670.519 --> 7676.030000000001
never be a disc it's over for the disc

7679.56 --> 7683.88
you have to walk me through it

7684.12 --> 7690.19
all right well it's the the orientation

7687.79 --> 7693.04
of the landmass is an ocean bottom how

7690.19 --> 7695.62
is it orientated in relation to itself

7693.04 --> 7697.15
to everything else surrounding it well

7695.62 --> 7700.87
now a lot of flat earthers are

7697.15 --> 7702.849999999999
presupposing that is basically as a disc

7700.87 --> 7706.09
they are taking the maps and they are

7702.85 --> 7708.219
concluding it must be a disc with the

7706.09 --> 7710.83
North Pole at the center and a nice ring

7708.219 --> 7714.79
at the outside and then presupposing a

7710.83 --> 7716.83
dome well I'm saying well no why this

7714.79 --> 7720.85
giant amount of presupposition what if

7716.83 --> 7722.8
it's just a square one direction is

7720.85 --> 7724.570000000001
north other direction is South then you

7722.8 --> 7727.84
have east and west and at least

7724.57 --> 7730.12
confirmed must be this is an antecedent

7727.84 --> 7739.4490000000005
for that concept east and west is a

7730.12 --> 7740.7699999999995
looping realm yes you're looking at if

7739.449 --> 7744.009999999999
you're looking at the hangouts

7740.77 --> 7747.900000000001
I'm literally below my video that is

7744.01 --> 7747.900000000001
that is the conceptualizing of it

7752.4 --> 7759.46
alright alright but yet then the map

7755.77 --> 7761.68
there is basically it and it's looping

7759.46 --> 7764.59
east to west and it might also be

7761.68 --> 7766.54
looping north to south I don't know I

7764.59 --> 7770.32
don't know maybe there's a border maybe

7766.54 --> 7772.63
there is a cut-off point maybe there's a

7770.32 --> 7775.33
cut-off point maybe it continues on into

7772.63 --> 7786.28
another part of the realm that just met

7775.33 --> 7788.68
that's next to it it well there are

7786.28 --> 7790.57
other people not a lot that also

7788.68 --> 7793.96
entertain it and what they call it I

7790.57 --> 7798.639999999999
think is the pac-man model I hate I hate

7793.96 --> 7801.4
that name because it plays into ooh it's

7798.64 --> 7807.85
a simulation it's a computer and I am

7801.4 --> 7810.879999999999
absolutely adamantly opposing yes no but

7807.85 --> 7812.110000000001
it brings in a simulation theory where

7810.88 --> 7813.969
nothing is real

7812.11 --> 7817.54
and that's a psychological obstacle that

7813.969 --> 7831.429
is just undesirable and I just don't

7817.54 --> 7834.699
think there is no cylinder cylinder

7831.429 --> 7837.07
would suggest a literal geometry there

7834.699 --> 7854.349999999999
is no literal geometry except for the

7837.07 --> 7856.63
flatness factor but do you understand

7854.35 --> 7858.1
but do you understand what I'm basically

7856.63 --> 7861.25
aiming at what I'm saying what I'm

7858.1 --> 7864.25
suggesting is that the very confined the

7861.25 --> 7867.34
space of the realm that we are present

7864.25 --> 7869.469
in has a limit a spatial limit not

7867.34 --> 7872.26
because of a boundary but because of a

7869.469 --> 7875.679
limited special confine in which it

7872.26 --> 7878.889
exists and that confine is expressed as

7875.679 --> 7881.28
a loop like a portal looping in on

7878.889 --> 7881.28
itself

7882.3 --> 7887.070000000001
do young I'm asking if you understand I

7895.23 --> 7903.099999999999
care for neither this is my this is my

7899.23 --> 7911.369
concept and whatever people are doing on

7903.1 --> 7914.2300000000005
their own time out their cross reference

7911.369 --> 7916.989
things pointing into a specific

7914.23 --> 7928.57
direction for you to assert this is my

7916.989 --> 7932.799999999999
motherland I stand by it right here it's

7928.57 --> 7935.92
right here that's my source it's right

7932.8 --> 7939.01
there it's conceptual it's purely

7935.92 --> 7941.139
conceptual it came literally in my mind

7939.01 --> 7943.33
it arrived in my visions I have no other

7941.139 --> 7945.38
sources then my original inspiration

7943.33 --> 7948.44
with was conceptualized in

7945.38 --> 7951.139
mind and it's fair enough that other

7948.44 --> 7954.919999999999
people are following similar thoughts

7951.139 --> 7956.84
trains because no idea is unique it's

7954.92 --> 7968.389
the only thing that is unique is what is

7956.84 --> 7974.719
done with the idea of even contextual

7968.389 --> 7978.4400000000005
evidence do we lack of proof lack of

7974.719 --> 7980.57
proof there's no absolutely no actual

7978.44 --> 7983.03
confirmation of any kind of dome or

7980.57 --> 7985.4
barrier there's absolutely no proof

7983.03 --> 7988.099999999999
confirmation of an actual physical

7985.4 --> 7990.62
literal ice ring surrounding a disk

7988.1 --> 7993.05
there's no actual physical little

7990.62 --> 7996.199
confirmation that the north polar region

7993.05 --> 7998.21
really does physically fit geometrically

7996.199 --> 8000.489
within that region there's no literal

7998.21 --> 8004.12
physical confirmation that the Equator

8000.489 --> 8006.5199999999995
is nothing but a straight line and all

8004.12 --> 8007.989
these factors put together basically say

8006.52 --> 8011.5
okay well as long as these conditions

8007.989 --> 8016.239
are there my model can work it could

8011.5 --> 8018.58
turn out to be real that's it

8016.239 --> 8020.5
that's my reasoning also by the way the

8018.58 --> 8023.11
straight line doesn't just count for the

8020.5 --> 8026.98
equator it also counts for the very

8023.11 --> 8030.79
South Pole itself is the wall a literal

8026.98 --> 8032.919999999999
90 degree parts of angle coming together

8030.79 --> 8034.57
in the end or is it actually turning out

8032.92 --> 8036.82
to be a hundred and eighty degrees it's

8034.57 --> 8040.36
actually a straight line all the way and

8036.82 --> 8046.84
it just intersects with itself just like

8040.36 --> 8049.36
the rest of everything in the realm yes

8046.84 --> 8052.2390000000005
look the think of it the South Pole as

8049.36 --> 8054.46
an ice cap or as ice with the wall so

8052.239 --> 8056.409
every piece of the wall it will not be a

8054.46 --> 8059.949
perfectly straight line will be all over

8056.409 --> 8063.94
the place but you can add up all those

8059.949 --> 8066.339999999999
angles of every piece and then if you

8063.94 --> 8068.349999999999
end up with 180 degrees that means that

8066.34 --> 8072.159000000001
it is technically in a straight line

8068.35 --> 8074.9490000000005
however chunky it is if it doesn't and

8072.159 --> 8078.099999999999
it actually ends up in a 360 degrees

8074.949 --> 8079.33
then you know you're contained by as is

8078.1 --> 8081.63
something that circle

8079.33 --> 8084.28
that yeah inside of a circle of ice and

8081.63 --> 8088.08
if it's the other way around it actually

8084.28 --> 8092.08
turns to zero then it is an actual

8088.08 --> 8095.11
geometrical island nobody's done this

8092.08 --> 8106.33
nobody's even talked about this except

8095.11 --> 8107.86
me in the Linguistics because you say an

8106.33 --> 8109.57
Antarctic Circle and that's something

8107.86 --> 8111.429999999999
that sits I was a kid I was wondering

8109.57 --> 8117.63
model they call it the circle it's at

8111.43 --> 8121.150000000001
best a disc Hey Circle Island or wall

8117.63 --> 8123.16
the wall you know the wall from Game of

8121.15 --> 8124.24
Thrones it's pretty damn straight and

8123.16 --> 8131.26
it's made of ice

8124.24 --> 8134.139999999999
and it's big that's fine I've seen it

8131.26 --> 8136.93
it's a straight ice wall it's just a

8134.14 --> 8138.910000000001
giant wall that's perfectly straight it

8136.93 --> 8141.01
was artificially erected so there's

8138.91 --> 8143.7699999999995
nothing like the pole caps but it's a

8141.01 --> 8146.25
straight wall it's not an island I just

8143.77 --> 8163.870000000001
thought it was remarkable about it I

8146.25 --> 8179.53
think it might be right they play with

8163.87 --> 8181.57
reality in fiction mediums because

8179.53 --> 8184.599999999999
usually it's a pile of manure that you

8181.57 --> 8187.33
get and you get to pick up your purse if

8184.6 --> 8190.650000000001
you can recognize them yeah or you could

8187.33 --> 8194.43
call it digging for diamonds in charcoal

8190.65 --> 8194.43
[Music]

8194.52 --> 8200.17
yes but you do get really black from it

8197.65 --> 8207.699999999999
if he's doing that if you turn into it

8200.17 --> 8209.95
you know coal - if it could work because

8207.7 --> 8213.230000000001
then you've got according to the Jewish

8209.95 --> 8219.230000000001
money but the see hole which would be

8213.23 --> 8226.4
a bit of one big ocean of oil on the

8219.23 --> 8230.18
underneath interesting there may be oils

8226.4 --> 8232.88
look what the Freak is even oil you know

8230.18 --> 8235.34
I I think that I've heard a story that

8232.88 --> 8237.529999999999
oil is abiotic that's basically bacteria

8235.34 --> 8244.28
eating away rock transforming it into

8237.53 --> 8246.74
oil crude oil and it fills itself up

8244.28 --> 8251.54
also very important fact about it

8246.74 --> 8253.789999999999
so it is it must be some kind of living

8251.54 --> 8257.36
process driving it or it could never

8253.79 --> 8259.490000000002
refill itself the wells must be some

8257.36 --> 8263.36
kind of living process behind it like

8259.49 --> 8265.82
not not dead living currently living or

8263.36 --> 8266.69
it could never refill itself that would

8265.82 --> 8273.949999999999
make any sense

8266.69 --> 8275.99
I think it's bacterial it's bacterias

8273.95 --> 8280.34
that under high pressure literally eat

8275.99 --> 8282.41
away rock and transform it into oil that

8280.34 --> 8284.93
and I'm not the one that made it up but

8282.41 --> 8287.06
I heard that from somebody that is kind

8284.93 --> 8300.050000000001
of in connection with oil business

8287.06 --> 8302.75
people no no no no no no that's a

8300.05 --> 8304.88
[ __ ] story based on evolution and

8302.75 --> 8307.31
all that crap with dinosaurs and blue

8304.88 --> 8311.119999999999
know that not at all I think their hold

8307.31 --> 8313.76
on oh please guys I think that gas may

8311.12 --> 8315.650000000001
have been originally like gas bubbles

8313.76 --> 8318.02
may derive from corpses and all that

8315.65 --> 8321.8
that kind of makes sense oil however no

8318.02 --> 8324.53
it's not all that matter I think it is

8321.8 --> 8329.06
literally bacteria not eating living

8324.53 --> 8331.03
tissue but rock actual literal stone

8329.06 --> 8333.17
so it's bacteria eating away

8331.03 --> 8335.390000000001
specifically under stone and those

8333.17 --> 8338.63
bacteria can really only exist under

8335.39 --> 8342.17
high pressure so they will always only

8338.63 --> 8344.3
exist very deep down that's what I think

8342.17 --> 8346.85
that's going on not some rotting plants

8344.3 --> 8349.34
and [ __ ] that is causing the oil not

8346.85 --> 8353.45
at all then it wouldn't refill at all I

8349.34 --> 8357.07
think the gas bubbles however are that

8353.45 --> 8359.630000000001
and then they will run out eventually

8357.07 --> 8369.801
they will not refill themselves like oil

8359.63 --> 8373.939999999999
wells that's what I feel good it is an

8369.801 --> 8383.18
apt ation is real evolution is giant

8373.94 --> 8384.2
[ __ ] story I totally agree I totally

8383.18 --> 8387.051
agree

8384.2 --> 8389.54
dude you've been with me for quite a

8387.051 --> 8391.520999999999
while and I really do appreciate the

8389.54 --> 8393.17
conversation but I think I'm gonna round

8391.521 --> 8396.2
out the show because I have been going

8393.17 --> 8399.021
for almost two and a half hours now when

8396.2 --> 8403.551000000001
it's called oh yeah we've been calling

8399.021 --> 8414.41
for an hour and 15 minutes oh good call

8403.551 --> 8417.619999999999
though I really appreciate thank you

8414.41 --> 8428.84
ooh oh and Benjamin has just gone live

8417.62 --> 8432.17
perfect timing all right well I'm gonna

8428.84 --> 8434.601
hang you up then I think thank you so

8432.17 --> 8435.32
much for coming again your name is Ben

8434.601 --> 8440.301000000001
Adams

8435.32 --> 8442.039999999999
correct you do have a YouTube channel

8440.301 --> 8455.270999999999
or are you just hanging around in chats

8442.04 --> 8458.660000000002
and everything yes yes you have my

8455.271 --> 8461.09
permission to do that but please hold on

8458.66 --> 8464.33
with the actual posting of it for two

8461.09 --> 8466.16
days because I am monetized and my

8464.33 --> 8467.84
monetization doesn't take kind to other

8466.16 --> 8469.94
people immediately putting out from the

8467.84 --> 8471.41
same material but if you wait for two

8469.94 --> 8473.87
days and you probably have no issue with

8471.41 --> 8476.051
that then sure you can you can mirror

8473.87 --> 8481.36
this absolutely

8476.051 --> 8483.4
oh I could do it I can help you do it a

8481.36 --> 8491.711000000001
lot quicker if you like it's not that

8483.4 --> 8494.109999999999
difficult alright hey thank you Ben was

8491.711 --> 8500.221
greatly a great conversation I loved it

8494.11 --> 8500.221000000001

every little bit helps it always gives a

8570.49 --> 8576.931
good feeling I will be back tomorrow

8572.711 --> 8579.73
with flat earth earlybird number 244 and

8576.931 --> 8584.65
who knows maybe we'll have another long

8579.73 --> 8586.811
day like this great guest or maybe not I

8584.65 --> 8588.58
don't know we'll see what happens there

8586.811 --> 8590.591
is apparently going to be a ball busters

8588.58 --> 8595.211
tonight can't wait to see Jon's

8590.591 --> 8597.49
brilliant defense if anything also still

8595.211 --> 8599.23
waiting for to see what rent is gonna do

8597.49 --> 8605.311
and respond to what happened yesterday

8599.23 --> 8607.279999999999
but yes until the next video at least

8605.311 --> 8609.91
keep it
