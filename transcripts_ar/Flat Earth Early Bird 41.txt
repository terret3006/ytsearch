3.02 --> 9.78
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.63 --> 14.129
early-bird number 41 I'm your host

9.78 --> 15.928999999999998
Arwen and today is a bit of a cloudy day

14.129 --> 21.75
but it's not that cold

15.929 --> 26.04
so hey could be worse so far after Dan

21.75 --> 29.39
winfield in chat and daniel field and

26.04 --> 29.39
clearly flat earth

36.67 --> 43.660000000000004
yeah ma'am

39.51 --> 50.11
yesterday's the Flat Earth

43.66 --> 53.62
early-bird was really intense and it's

50.11 --> 56.32
very very cool

53.62 --> 59.919999999999995
I watched it back also watched back the

56.32 --> 63.55
entirety of my appearance on Tim's

59.92 --> 66.67
hangout was quite impressed

63.55 --> 71.86
I felt I did better than I thought I did

66.67 --> 75.91
while I was doing it and just some weird

71.86 --> 78.88
oddities about it because the way it

75.91 --> 81.75
turned out basically what you can hear

78.88 --> 85.06
from the Hangout itself or from YouTube

81.75 --> 86.979
as you listen to it compared to what you

85.06 --> 90.81
can actually hear while being on the

86.979 --> 93.28
panel because in the YouTube video

90.81 --> 95.38
sometimes when somebody speaks loud the

93.28 --> 98.619
rest is just you don't hear them you

95.38 --> 102.99
just don't while on the panel you can

98.619 --> 107.44
still hear them but more softly and thus

102.99 --> 110.89
yeah many weird things happen because of

107.44 --> 113.08
this because people say like almost in

110.89 --> 115.509
this fashion I guess been in between

113.08 --> 119.11
tongue and cheek they say silly things

115.509 --> 122.979
are outrageous things but you don't hear

119.11 --> 125.56
that on the YouTube so yeah then I tend

122.979 --> 128.38
to respond to that but you couldn't

125.56 --> 129.52
actually hear that on the on the yeah

128.38 --> 132.16
you can't actually hear it on the

129.52 --> 135.31
YouTube video so it's kind of weird but

132.16 --> 139.84
I guess that's just a problem with

135.31 --> 146.92000000000002
hangouts anyway yeah I got offered some

139.84 --> 151.27
help by Adam ikan to basically guide me

146.92 --> 152.10999999999999
in setting up my OBS and I really

151.27 --> 156.13000000000002
appreciate that

152.11 --> 160.93
so yeah shout out to Adam Eaton ayran

156.13 --> 165.51999999999998
real media and yeah thanks man I will

160.93 --> 166.78
definitely do that in the

165.52 --> 170.31900000000002
not-too-distant future

166.78 --> 175.459
I yeah I want to do that and it'll

170.319 --> 180.17
allow this early work show to bring in

175.459 --> 182.77
potentially more risky guests without ya

180.17 --> 185.78
destroying my channel in the process so

182.77 --> 191.63
hope looking forward to that at the same

185.78 --> 195.59
time yeah my intro still waiting for

191.63 --> 201.17
somebody that can help me out with the

195.59 --> 206.33
title card Horry had a rough example of

201.17 --> 209.77999999999997
something that he showed me and yeah I

206.33 --> 214.489
don't know maybe we'll get back to that

209.78 --> 216.53
or somebody else comes by contacts me

214.489 --> 221.959
about it but yeah these are things are

216.53 --> 225.05
on the work so good get quite good quite

221.959 --> 229.51
enthusiastic about it although taking it

225.05 --> 229.51000000000002
rather slowly as I typically do

252.53 --> 268.67
very funny Dan Winfield it's all masks I

263.6 --> 273.40000000000003
think is that actually may actually be a

268.67 --> 279.31
face I think a woman's face anyway

273.4 --> 279.31
yeah hi guys I'm being chat with whit oh

281.38 --> 289.73
there okay clearly flat earth asks if I

287.03 --> 290.9
looked into the third model of Egypt no

289.73 --> 294.53000000000003
no idea

290.9 --> 296.03
I remember you or somebody else dropping

294.53 --> 300.84999999999997
that in chat before I know I haven't

296.03 --> 303.84999999999997
looked at it I don't know google it

300.85 --> 303.85
see

311.37 --> 328.61
Oh 3d I mean 3d model of Egypt right

329.24 --> 335.04
yeah now now I get it

332.07 --> 343.11
yeah I heard of that that that that they

335.04 --> 346.47
did that very cool and yeah I've seen

343.11 --> 349.08000000000004
that on television even for a while ago

346.47 --> 351.27000000000004
or just off buying YouTube video but

349.08 --> 353.88
yeah I think this thing has been out

351.27 --> 357.12
there for a while yeah

353.88 --> 363.02
yeah the videos from the video I'm

357.12 --> 364.35
looking at right now is from April 10th

363.02 --> 365.96999999999997
2015

364.35 --> 376.28000000000003
so yeah it has been out there for a

365.97 --> 376.28000000000003
while let me present snippet of it

380.479 --> 390.05
so yeah pretty impressive internal works

383.96 --> 396.58
external works with restored painting as

390.05 --> 399.58
the historians see it yeah cool stuff

396.58 --> 399.58
anyway

404.71 --> 408.09
all right so I looked at it

419.639 --> 422.509
mm-hmm

442.539 --> 453.46
you know a funny sensation that I had

448.479 --> 457.099
comparing the appearance on Tim's debate

453.46 --> 460.78
I could call it because that really is a

457.099 --> 465.199
more rigid debate format that he upholds

460.78 --> 468.099
slow as it may be comparing that to be a

465.199 --> 472.43
flat earth debate how Nathan handles it

468.099 --> 476.319
which is substantially quicker paced and

472.43 --> 482.44
more interesting for flatter authorities

476.319 --> 488.029
I found it kind of interesting that I

482.44 --> 491.0
had yeah plenty of opportunity and time

488.029 --> 493.49
to completely lay out rectangular

491.0 --> 496.33
looping concepts and angles to things

493.49 --> 499.779
and basically introduce the third model

496.33 --> 502.81899999999996
because yeah they still had the typical

499.779 --> 507.56
false dichotomy of who your Flat Earth

502.819 --> 510.11
model is they all do it like even if

507.56 --> 511.009
they admit that yeah that's actually a

510.11 --> 513.8000000000001
false dichotomy

511.009 --> 519.169
they neurotically just fall back to

513.8 --> 521.4499999999999
saying that like a baller saying even

519.169 --> 524.93
though they yeah some of them will admit

521.45 --> 528.0790000000001
that yeah okay it's not the only model

524.93 --> 530.959
or MA yeah or as Nathan likes to say it

528.079 --> 532.7299999999999
models or pseudoscience and it's not

530.959 --> 539.75
even relevant to the scientific method

532.73 --> 541.64
which is also correct but in contrast to

539.75 --> 547.04
the debates when I bring up the

541.64 --> 553.03
rectangular looping model there's only a

547.04 --> 557.11
few people that really even

553.03 --> 560.04
listen to what I'm entertaining and they

557.11 --> 562.99
seem to be more confused than anything

560.04 --> 568.75
Riley being especially one of these

562.99 --> 570.94
people Nathan also I don't know maybe

568.75 --> 574.63
it's principal he that just doesn't go

570.94 --> 577.6
there I don't know I don't know by Randy

574.63 --> 579.73
I don't think he he touches he really

577.6 --> 585.7
touches it so when I explain it it'll

579.73 --> 590.02
just go right past him and um

585.7 --> 593.32
Tim's that didn't happen most of the

590.02 --> 596.71
people like although I don't think

593.32 --> 598.84
soundly soundly definitely did not he

596.71 --> 602.77
was very much in a dramatist like mode

598.84 --> 607.35
completely ignoring everything or only

602.77 --> 609.4
fishing for entry angles for

607.35 --> 614.11
counter-arguments to completely derail

609.4 --> 617.38
everything but the others Tim and the

614.11 --> 620.0500000000001
other guys validation boy of course very

617.38 --> 624.46
cool guy I'd love to have him on the

620.05 --> 629.37
show that would be very interesting they

624.46 --> 629.37
all I could see that they were

635.11 --> 637.17
you

701.08 --> 707.9300000000001
and

702.88 --> 711.79
stupid internet connection have no idea

707.93 --> 711.79
how long was I have

718.58 --> 725.11
it's great timing just just like just

722.81 --> 725.1099999999999
great

732.87 --> 743.17
yeah that's funny

739.32 --> 746.5600000000001
PJ has a interesting idea every now and

743.17 --> 749.3199999999999
then yeah you know what maybe soundly is

746.56 --> 752.6199999999999
a crossover between Seth MacFarlane and

749.32 --> 760.0300000000001
Elon Musk because he does have like the

752.62 --> 763.09
little bit bigger head like light Seth

760.03 --> 765.66
MacFarlane has so maybe he's the kind is

763.09 --> 769.02
the crossover between them anyway and

765.66 --> 773.05
look I was just being silly to him

769.02 --> 776.8299999999999
because he really is soundly really is

773.05 --> 781.7099999999999
just a deceptive clown he is exactly

776.83 --> 787.99
like rumpus in a way worse than wellness

781.71 --> 790.2900000000001
because rumpus has a as a distinct ego

787.99 --> 794.47
that really drives him and he's

790.29 --> 797.05
entertaining in his self wallowing and

794.47 --> 799.0
arrogance it is kind of entertaining

797.05 --> 803.89
anyway it's funny up to a certain degree

799.0 --> 806.73
until sex Robinson soundly is just in

803.89 --> 806.73
your face

807.39 --> 816.36
acting like knowing not not getting

811.36 --> 816.36
triggered really it's just completely

819.13 --> 826.27
yeah straight to your face and he's more

823.03 --> 829.0899999999999
focused at it but he applies exactly the

826.27 --> 834.46
same tactics and reasoning structures as

829.09 --> 840.4300000000001
rompers do does so I was just poking at

834.46 --> 844.2
him because he deserves it his respect

840.43 --> 844.1999999999999
from the ballers is completely misplaced

845.88 --> 849.009
[Music]

849.63 --> 858.04
that's hilarious PJ hey cat sighs

855.72 --> 862.11
welcome to the flat earth early bird

858.04 --> 871.17
show went James

862.11 --> 871.17
mister ricks j-mac Craig a war sweet

879.68 --> 888.87
but yeah so except for soundly I really

885.66 --> 891.63
got the feeling that like I I touched

888.87 --> 896.01
these people's minds in the sense that

891.63 --> 899.37
they were grasping some of what I was

896.01 --> 903.63
saying they were getting the roots of it

899.37 --> 905.88
I plan to deceive potentially see for

903.63 --> 908.01
them to have a room to speculate about

905.88 --> 912.93
it and that's a good thing now it's up

908.01 --> 916.0699999999999
to them to let it grow take it more

912.93 --> 922.77
serious or just let it be what it is

916.07 --> 924.96
you'll see in time but yeah validation

922.77 --> 930.21
boy he really gets the holographic sky

924.96 --> 932.7800000000001
he basically the intangible sky argument

930.21 --> 936.33
he's very proud of it and I guess that

932.78 --> 940.3199999999999
completely separate of one another we

936.33 --> 948.33
pretty much figured out that concept

940.32 --> 950.1600000000001
separately and I called it the the did I

948.33 --> 953.88
call it a rich I call it the globe of

950.16 --> 957.6899999999999
the heavens right now I think I started

953.88 --> 959.67
out with the basically claiming out of

957.69 --> 963.57
nothing that's how it appeared to you

959.67 --> 967.29
guys to the chat I call it a holographic

963.57 --> 970.2600000000001
Sun and then I think the holographic

967.29 --> 973.02
happens or holographic sky I started out

970.26 --> 974.55
with the word holographic like this now

973.02 --> 977.67
I just call it the globe of the heavens

974.55 --> 982.9399999999999
because that adds the geometrical globe

977.67 --> 986.43
aspects at the edge of vision but yeah

982.94 --> 990.6
validation boy calls it the intangible

986.43 --> 993.7099999999999
sky and yeah it's basically the same

990.6 --> 996.089
concept it focuses more on the

993.71 --> 998.76
physicality aspect or the non

996.089 --> 1002.69
physicality aspect of the globe of the

998.76 --> 1006.29
heavens and yeah that's just another

1002.69 --> 1008.69
approach to the same concept and I guess

1006.29 --> 1009.279
that we figured it out pretty much at

1008.69 --> 1011.5600000000001
the same

1009.279 --> 1012.399
time we just saw it and started arguing

1011.56 --> 1015.449
for it

1012.399 --> 1018.939
separately and I even remember back then

1015.449 --> 1022.959
that Patricia or somebody was it Nathan

1018.939 --> 1025.209
somebody what told me when they heard me

1022.959 --> 1029.1589999999999
talking about it then like hey that

1025.209 --> 1032.949
sounds kind of like validation boy so I

1029.159 --> 1035.5590000000002
do even remember that somebody else was

1032.949 --> 1042.069
supposed to be thinking of something

1035.559 --> 1046.27
similar so yeah I'm not gonna try to

1042.069 --> 1046.99
claim the grand prize on the globe of

1046.27 --> 1048.94
the heavens

1046.99 --> 1052.8700000000001
although the terminology is mine and

1048.94 --> 1057.76
yeah the history of the reasoning has

1052.87 --> 1060.34
been manifested separately but yeah it's

1057.76 --> 1062.26
typical I guess when the time comes when

1060.34 --> 1066.84
a certain level of information comes

1062.26 --> 1069.37
afloat many different people will likely

1066.84 --> 1073.72
because of that new level of information

1069.37 --> 1076.4499999999998
being coming a flood will pretty much

1073.72 --> 1078.73
start to conceive the same type of ideas

1076.45 --> 1084.07
it's not illogical that that would

1078.73 --> 1086.8600000000001
happen so in that sense I love always to

1084.07 --> 1089.46
claim that I'm first at something it's

1086.86 --> 1092.7099999999998
very satisfying to me but I'm not

1089.46 --> 1096.549
actually believing it to the absolute

1092.71 --> 1098.14
because I know look probably every idea

1096.549 --> 1100.3899999999999
I ever had is probably already being

1098.14 --> 1104.3200000000002
conceived several times and may be

1100.39 --> 1107.8300000000002
disregarded or just glanced past or

1104.32 --> 1110.049
forgotten so in that sense they're

1107.83 --> 1112.48
actually not really my ideas I'm just

1110.049 --> 1115.24
the one that caught it it's like fishing

1112.48 --> 1118.03
and I'm just really good at that fishing

1115.24 --> 1122.83
thing but I didn't actually make the

1118.03 --> 1125.62
fish just catching them so that's how I

1122.83 --> 1128.049
see that in all honesty but yeah

1125.62 --> 1131.77
socially I'm afraid that I do have an

1128.049 --> 1136.51
ego and I do love to claim I am the

1131.77 --> 1139.049
first to figure this out so just human

1136.51 --> 1139.049
in that sense

1143.93 --> 1148.7
hello Andrea's design

1160.27 --> 1162.929
yeah

1164.59 --> 1171.539
but yeah I love to hear what validation

1168.129 --> 1171.539
boys as

1172.11 --> 1178.629
idea-wise concerning the potential cause

1175.179 --> 1182.999
of the intangible sky and Dossi ascribe

1178.629 --> 1195.389
to this model or what is this concept

1182.999 --> 1195.3890000000001
also i've been thinking about devising a

1196.259 --> 1213.009
a potential a map a conceptual map a

1207.389 --> 1219.1
projection based map but with actual

1213.009 --> 1222.46
sizes of the land surface and that's for

1219.1 --> 1227.049
actual to scale it's like a completely

1222.46 --> 1233.679
linear scale and then basically cutting

1227.049 --> 1234.249
up the map and then every part where

1233.679 --> 1238.539
it's cut up

1234.249 --> 1242.919
it is technically connected there but

1238.539 --> 1246.039
it's just yeah the way it's connected in

1242.919 --> 1249.1290000000001
the the north to south way is going to

1246.039 --> 1252.669
be different as it is connected to the

1249.129 --> 1256.559
east and west and i want to try to

1252.669 --> 1260.5590000000002
conceptualize the chain of beads

1256.559 --> 1264.639
rectangular looping world map concept

1260.559 --> 1270.9289999999999
because I kind of think that really may

1264.639 --> 1280.08
be the case and the funny thing is again

1270.929 --> 1283.6000000000001
the that that archaic shape that

1280.08 --> 1288.24
atmospheric electricity catching device

1283.6 --> 1293.399
presumably with the spheres and they're

1288.24 --> 1297.1490000000001
like wound and a cross on top with like

1293.399 --> 1303.389
ice crystal things on it

1297.149 --> 1308.7189999999998
this device yep that bloke thing what if

1303.389 --> 1314.0089999999998
it is really like that what if the

1308.719 --> 1315.749
realms surface is could be suggested to

1314.009 --> 1318.779
be interconnected like a globe but

1315.749 --> 1321.539
basically is flat and that's just the

1318.779 --> 1323.969
amount of surface there is in Israel and

1321.539 --> 1327.95
to the north and potentially to the

1323.969 --> 1331.409
south assuming we are the middle section

1327.95 --> 1334.469
there is like a narrowing down at the

1331.409 --> 1338.159
north and the south and then it opens up

1334.469 --> 1348.059
to another realm with roughly the same

1338.159 --> 1351.21
shape that makes sense to me and they I

1348.059 --> 1353.099
called my mobile rectangular looping

1351.21 --> 1357.089
model assuming it is basically a

1353.099 --> 1360.119
straight cut out but yeah I because of

1357.089 --> 1366.2
special non-linearity concerning the

1360.119 --> 1369.33
loop it could be at the equator a wider

1366.2 --> 1372.1490000000001
cross-section from east west than to the

1369.33 --> 1374.82
north it would be directly looping in a

1372.149 --> 1378.779
straight line but the space in between

1374.82 --> 1381.2
the loop is simply shorter and that

1378.779 --> 1383.249
could end at some point narrow down

1381.2 --> 1384.8990000000001
Lucas very short you're still going to

1383.249 --> 1389.6390000000001
be walking a straight line but ending up

1384.899 --> 1391.859
at the same place and then eventually ya

1389.639 --> 1397.619
cross over into the other realm where it

1391.859 --> 1402.379
widens again where this loop this loop

1397.619 --> 1408.2389999999998
space basically widens up again yeah

1402.379 --> 1414.089
it's kind of tough to imagine but try it

1408.239 --> 1416.3690000000001
I will try to sketch something out maybe

1414.089 --> 1421.249
draw it a little bit better even better

1416.369 --> 1425.309
even then make something out of it

1421.249 --> 1429.229
because I think that that the beads

1425.309 --> 1429.229
concept maybe

1430.06 --> 1439.01
on average how you say I'm doing it by

1435.43 --> 1441.17
intuition mostly and by reflecting it on

1439.01 --> 1443.21
everything I've come across I think it's

1441.17 --> 1446.3300000000002
more likely that if the world is

1443.21 --> 1452.54
rectangular looping that it's looping in

1446.33 --> 1456.1899999999998
a non straight section from east to west

1452.54 --> 1465.83
so that it it is more likely just to be

1456.19 --> 1469.52
irregularly looping but in a basically

1465.83 --> 1470.27
the distance in a sinus wave in a in a

1469.52 --> 1475.94
ripple

1470.27 --> 1479.8899999999999
I think that's likely or how do you say

1475.94 --> 1484.18
there naturally it falls in the typical

1479.89 --> 1485.74
wave patterns and that just seems

1484.18 --> 1490.13
logical

1485.74 --> 1502.52
concerning the the fractal nature of

1490.13 --> 1506.0800000000002
matter and energy and all that right ok

1502.52 --> 1512.15
let's see this hmm

1506.08 --> 1516.28
hey Allenby wants to join I don't know I

1512.15 --> 1520.01
guess might ruin it

1516.28 --> 1522.41
but yeah ok LLL give you a chance if

1520.01 --> 1528.32
you're gonna be annoying I'm just gonna

1522.41 --> 1534.3700000000001
kick you out but that's for soon you're

1528.32 --> 1534.37
not gonna do that so there you go

1554.32 --> 1561.76
hey Ellen good morning Owen how are you

1562.36 --> 1567.1399999999999
you're not looking very Christmasy

1564.53 --> 1571.46
should I set up a GoFundMe to get you a

1567.14 --> 1573.98
Christmas jumper sure as long as it's

1571.46 --> 1577.58
black you can't have a black Christmas

1573.98 --> 1580.64
Jim huh guys again I won't see you in a

1577.58 --> 1583.46
Christmas jumper and what's that

1580.64 --> 1584.75
supposed to look like just do you not

1583.46 --> 1586.64
have a tradition in Holland where

1584.75 --> 1590.059
everybody wears like really rubbish

1586.64 --> 1591.74
Christmassy jumpers at Christmas No then

1590.059 --> 1595.82
you should get with the British F's we

1591.74 --> 1598.99
have sinter Klass we all were really

1595.82 --> 1606.46
terrible Christmas jumpers at Christmas

1598.99 --> 1609.32
okay I'm sorry it's good fun well we

1606.46 --> 1613.46
especially this this the south of the

1609.32 --> 1616.04
Netherlands does have carnival that's

1613.46 --> 1619.28
usually the time when people go dress

1616.04 --> 1623.09
completely insane do crazy [ __ ] and get

1619.28 --> 1627.77
drunk I think you'd look good in a red

1623.09 --> 1632.059
Christmas jumper well here no no I don't

1627.77 --> 1633.46
like wearing red at all all right it's

1632.059 --> 1638.48
just not my color

1633.46 --> 1640.809
just black mostly yeah right I'm gonna

1638.48 --> 1647.66
find a black Christmas jumper and

1640.809 --> 1650.36
organize organize it for you I I'm

1647.66 --> 1652.8400000000001
really gonna use it to be fair I'd like

1650.36 --> 1660.1399999999999
if I could get you one with lights on

1652.84 --> 1665.059
what's no I can't believe you've never

1660.14 --> 1667.72
heard of fun Christmas jumpers no it's

1665.059 --> 1667.72
nothing

1668.86 --> 1677.3
so yeah I've not never been really much

1671.63 --> 1679.16
of a dress-up guy ever yeah and when I

1677.3 --> 1681.32
do it wish you should he gave me

1679.16 --> 1689.48
birthday he did since they've been done

1681.32 --> 1697.46
that for a while well that's your

1689.48 --> 1701.41
Christmas present ruined what you're

1697.46 --> 1701.41
looking forward to in 2019

1710.649 --> 1716.299
I'm gonna be nervous a lot on one side

1713.98 --> 1720.97
on the other side yeah it's kind of

1716.299 --> 1720.97
things are gonna be really well and

1721.629 --> 1729.259
probably gonna be glorious summer and I

1726.71 --> 1732.23
don't know yeah I'm looking forward to

1729.259 --> 1736.909
lots of things because I am gonna be

1732.23 --> 1737.96
less broke than I am this year for one I

1736.909 --> 1742.7
know always a good thing

1737.96 --> 1744.529
yes and we'll just see where it goes

1742.7 --> 1749.299
yeah I'd like to continue building this

1744.529 --> 1751.46
show and see if I can do this it's like

1749.299 --> 1757.009
the first time ever that I did it that

1751.46 --> 1759.6200000000001
I've attempted a daily show and before I

1757.009 --> 1761.929
read before I really thought about it

1759.62 --> 1764.57
and it was like oh my god no that's way

1761.929 --> 1766.46
too hard taking very serious getting

1764.57 --> 1768.559
nervous about it but now that I just

1766.46 --> 1771.289
started I started because I really

1768.559 --> 1775.19
didn't think about it just did it and

1771.289 --> 1776.99
now it's rather like can I go on or is

1775.19 --> 1779.8990000000001
there really nothing out there for me

1776.99 --> 1782.6200000000001
left and yeah I keep on going and keep

1779.899 --> 1784.85
on looking forward to it every day oh

1782.62 --> 1787.039
yeah there's plenty of topics to talk

1784.85 --> 1790.129
about what you need yeah that's the

1787.039 --> 1792.289
advantage of my own platform and you've

1790.129 --> 1793.37
been appearing on more shows saw you on

1792.289 --> 1795.35
Tim's the other night

1793.37 --> 1802.6689999999999
Yeah right yeah it was pretty

1795.35 --> 1804.08
interesting Tim sounded drunk no did you

1802.669 --> 1805.24
see the video after when he could his

1804.08 --> 1809.0
fault

1805.24 --> 1814.21
no yeah drop the glass there was

1809.0 --> 1814.21
drinking off and stood on it oh that's

1816.25 --> 1823.73
so oh it only wears black well I

1820.49 --> 1829.419
sometimes wear white when I go to church

1823.73 --> 1833.659
you go to church a lot not recently no I

1829.419 --> 1835.3990000000001
I feel kind of it's weird I feel kind of

1833.659 --> 1838.159
ashamed even though I shouldn't really

1835.399 --> 1841.039
because principally I am still following

1838.159 --> 1842.39
the path and you don't need to go to

1841.039 --> 1846.86
church reading up

1842.39 --> 1848.96
but the church has undergone a big

1846.86 --> 1851.9299999999998
renewal right here that's the one that

1848.96 --> 1854.77
it can go to for a while and yeah it's

1851.93 --> 1857.18
all really nice and new and more

1854.77 --> 1860.93
mechanical things electronic things in

1857.18 --> 1864.02
there new lamps but I don't like how it

1860.93 --> 1866.6000000000001
changed and I don't like the new wood

1864.02 --> 1869.69
the old wood was had special energy

1866.6 --> 1871.6699999999998
collected over the over the decades and

1869.69 --> 1874.48
it's no longer there because they've

1871.67 --> 1879.1000000000001
removed at all and yeah they also

1874.48 --> 1882.89
exchanged the piano for an organ and

1879.1 --> 1884.75
it's just not the same it just doesn't

1882.89 --> 1886.8500000000001
feel right anymore I really like the

1884.75 --> 1888.92
piano I guess that's my own thing

1886.85 --> 1891.23
because my mother used to play a piano a

1888.92 --> 1893.96
lot when I was a kid so it touches me in

1891.23 --> 1898.22
a special place and that's no longer

1893.96 --> 1900.5
there and now it's just so the boy the

1898.22 --> 1904.13
boy but the building's changed yeah and

1900.5 --> 1906.44
the people are still nice but there's

1904.13 --> 1908.8100000000002
just not this blanket of energy there

1906.44 --> 1912.1100000000001
anymore not for a while it might come

1908.81 --> 1915.26
back but yeah combine that with the

1912.11 --> 1919.1899999999998
organ that I just I don't like being in

1915.26 --> 1921.92
the presence of an organ you know some

1919.19 --> 1925.3400000000001
organs are really special like the real

1921.92 --> 1928.7
real huge ones they're very special but

1925.34 --> 1930.23
just a regular typical organ sound I

1928.7 --> 1935.81
don't like that sound

1930.23 --> 1938.18
I find it disruptive it vibrates me in a

1935.81 --> 1943.3999999999999
way I don't like it that disrupts my

1938.18 --> 1946.46
concentration yeah well too many changes

1943.4 --> 1948.2900000000002
in won't go that well they did a big

1946.46 --> 1950.3600000000001
overhaul yeah that's the way they did it

1948.29 --> 1951.26
but I just don't really like the way

1950.36 --> 1956.75
they changed it

1951.26 --> 1959.33
I don't know I'm too picky I said I kind

1956.75 --> 1960.71
of feel guilty like yeah it's that a

1959.33 --> 1964.1
really good reason not to go to church

1960.71 --> 1968.3
anymore well for me kind of is and hey I

1964.1 --> 1972.11
still pray what I'm some me Sunday

1968.3 --> 1974.45
mostly and I am very focused on the path

1972.11 --> 1976.2199999999998
of Christ so in that sense I still I

1974.45 --> 1979.01
still simplify

1976.22 --> 1983.39
and I still think about these people in

1979.01 --> 1987.77
a positive way and and I am still gonna

1983.39 --> 1990.679
go back but not as a as a weekly thing

1987.77 --> 1996.02
anymore I know you tried any more

1990.679 --> 1998.929
churches in Utrecht there must be more

1996.02 --> 2001.72
than one Church that's not it's those

1998.929 --> 2005.26
are different types of churches this is

2001.72 --> 2008.679
a latter-day saints church is that

2005.26 --> 2010.57
moment yeah and that's a very different

2008.679 --> 2015.3400000000001
if I'd walk into one of these other

2010.57 --> 2018.28
churches and I have tried that with the

2015.34 --> 2022.539
way that I look they're all like really

2018.28 --> 2024.46
suspicious and everything and no I don't

2022.539 --> 2026.2
know I don't feel welcome anywhere else

2024.46 --> 2029.65
really the Mormons are really welcoming

2026.2 --> 2034.6000000000001
so when they judge you because you dress

2029.65 --> 2036.46
all in black I guess then you made a

2034.6 --> 2040.809
Christmas do house I wear my ring and

2036.46 --> 2043.179
everything and a a peer pressure guy

2040.809 --> 2048.97
worse is it's in there by the way hello

2043.179 --> 2052.77
hi yes one what's the ring Owen I made

2048.97 --> 2059.1899999999996
it it's my ring so look it so many times

2052.77 --> 2066.179
look okay all right

2059.19 --> 2070.419
nice ring it's my first golden ring made

2066.179 --> 2080.889
nice without guidance of the teacher by

2070.419 --> 2084.669
the way I always was really bad what I

2080.889 --> 2088.629
always was really bad at like making

2084.669 --> 2092.77
things by hand right I could manage it

2088.629 --> 2095.94
and at school I always passed yet I

2092.77 --> 2102.04
always was really bad at it was like

2095.94 --> 2106.57
barely passed so but with enough effort

2102.04 --> 2108.4
I think I could do a decent ring or

2106.57 --> 2109.96
whatever it would just take a lot of

2108.4 --> 2114.01
time and

2109.96 --> 2116.4700000000003
a lot of failed attempts what nah you

2114.01 --> 2118.69
just the the biggest part it's planning

2116.47 --> 2121.5099999999998
it is design it is very much like

2118.69 --> 2123.55
architecture you need to plan for every

2121.51 --> 2126.73
step and you also need to have failsafe

2123.55 --> 2129.849
plans like what could go wrong what do I

2126.73 --> 2132.19
do if this go wrong what do I do if that

2129.849 --> 2135.57
goes wrong you need to plan ahead for

2132.19 --> 2138.58
everything and you need to know yourself

2135.57 --> 2141.94
how good at you you are at these

2138.58 --> 2143.98
processes and before you make a real

2141.94 --> 2146.08
ring like with gold and everything if

2143.98 --> 2149.77
you're not really sure then most people

2146.08 --> 2152.02
try out that model in either silver or

2149.77 --> 2155.349
copper usually two silvers because

2152.02 --> 2156.94
silver is really cheap actually when you

2155.349 --> 2160.3900000000003
buy something silver then the biggest

2156.94 --> 2163.18
cost goes to the the working on it the

2160.39 --> 2164.02
craftsmanship so where is actually

2163.18 --> 2167.7999999999997
really cheap

2164.02 --> 2170.38
volumize so you make it a test case and

2167.8 --> 2172.1800000000003
see okay this is how you roughly do it

2170.38 --> 2174.9100000000003
with call it's gonna be slightly

2172.18 --> 2177.7599999999998
different like this because you know the

2174.91 --> 2182.56
material properties and then you do it

2177.76 --> 2184.57
for realsies yeah that's how Goldsmith's

2182.56 --> 2188.31
do it

2184.57 --> 2199.4500000000003
I made silver rings before this one I

2188.31 --> 2205.39
still have it the trial ring oh by the

2199.45 --> 2209.6189999999997
way Geo Schreiber invited me to a

2205.39 --> 2215.68
hangout and I can not officially but he

2209.619 --> 2218.56
asked like if he offered to make a

2215.68 --> 2222.49
hangout where I can ask some questions

2218.56 --> 2226.32
about the heliocentric model let's see

2222.49 --> 2231.089
maybe a we will find the time where it's

2226.32 --> 2231.089
where it will be alright for both of us

2232.08 --> 2240.04
silly question said Jesus creeper has

2236.44 --> 2243.64
never been on camera right I don't know

2240.04 --> 2246.34
I haven't seen many of his videos

2243.64 --> 2250.39
I don't think he ever has you know

2246.34 --> 2253.36
German right yeah pretty well it seems

2250.39 --> 2256.2999999999997
that Diaz Trevor seems to be German if I

2253.36 --> 2259.09
would listen to his accent so could you

2256.3 --> 2262.3300000000004
try him out if that is real avi or if he

2259.09 --> 2267.25
actually turns out to be inactive that's

2262.33 --> 2273.31
do that I think he is German

2267.25 --> 2277.21
I could try maybe if we really can make

2273.31 --> 2280.72
this hang out and eat what is this a

2277.21 --> 2284.62
like he's going to holiday like Friday

2280.72 --> 2298.12
let's see maybe until then we can manage

2284.62 --> 2300.73
to talk or not so let's see yeah so Alan

2298.12 --> 2302.83
how are you doing how do you I'm pretty

2300.73 --> 2312.19
good Xander do you uh do you enjoy a

2302.83 --> 2315.46
Christmas jumper I where I'm from we

2312.19 --> 2324.46
don't really celebrates that much you

2315.46 --> 2329.23
know yeah we even work at Christmas so I

2324.46 --> 2331.66
think what yeah it's kinda but I don't

2329.23 --> 2334.7400000000002
really mind because we had to choose

2331.66 --> 2339.94
between Christmas or New Year's Eve and

2334.74 --> 2342.7299999999996
for me in my state I have to beat

2339.94 --> 2346.36
friends etc New Year's Eve Christmas is

2342.73 --> 2349.87
just like just dinner together with

2346.36 --> 2353.32
family and that's it's not gifts no

2349.87 --> 2355.9
gifts nothing right so I think the

2353.32 --> 2359.71
tradition where I'm from kinda died out

2355.9 --> 2360.61
a little bit to warts from people what's

2359.71 --> 2364.51
still enjoyable

2360.61 --> 2368.05
it's still a nice reason to meet each

2364.51 --> 2374.0
other again where are you in Berlin in

2368.05 --> 2378.0800000000004
Zurich Switzerland very expensive

2374.0 --> 2383.03
yeah it's so expensive I mean the I live

2378.08 --> 2385.8489999999997
in a apartment with five five rooms to

2383.03 --> 2388.0400000000004
live in like five living rooms and it's

2385.849 --> 2392.05
like 100 years old and the costs like

2388.04 --> 2394.64
four thousand dollars a month so

2392.05 --> 2400.099
everything here is expensive as [ __ ] so

2394.64 --> 2402.3199999999997
I have to live with other people too to

2400.099 --> 2406.1800000000003
pay it up in Switzerland a couple times

2402.32 --> 2409.88
stayed in the hotel that has only

2406.18 --> 2412.8999999999996
tinting models in pretty near the train

2409.88 --> 2415.67
station it's pretty central

2412.9 --> 2419.15
what do you say what did what has it in

2415.67 --> 2422.42
it I didn't understand it has life-size

2419.15 --> 2426.65
models of Tintin ah ah yeah next to the

2422.42 --> 2432.619
train station yeah maybe I know which

2426.65 --> 2437.63
one I don't remember the name like the

2432.619 --> 2441.88
maiden station right yes I think I've

2437.63 --> 2446.4500000000003
been there once I don't remember the

2441.88 --> 2449.3900000000003
entering it though that's it Zurich is

2446.45 --> 2451.8489999999997
the only place of being where the

2449.39 --> 2458.15
breakfast in the hotel was cheaper than

2451.849 --> 2461.51
the cafe around the corner sure like

2458.15 --> 2466.64
three dollars for one what mineral water

2461.51 --> 2469.4900000000002
rights yes so it ridiculous dude it's at

2466.64 --> 2473.24
least people earn a little bit more than

2469.49 --> 2478.1299999999997
the other and average so kind of balance

2473.24 --> 2480.6499999999996
out the gun I kinda like it here maybe

2478.13 --> 2484.4900000000002
but yet maybe I will go back to Italy

2480.65 --> 2493.82
one day but see I would say at least go

2484.49 --> 2497.39
back to food I think no one other than

2493.82 --> 2501.29
Italians can make good pizza I've never

2497.39 --> 2504.7999999999997
tasted as good as in Italy Americans

2501.29 --> 2507.89
just don't know sometimes you guys like

2504.8 --> 2510.289
make gigantic with like

2507.89 --> 2514.7599999999998
ten layers of cheese I think New York

2510.289 --> 2521.4500000000003
makes it more like Finn right yes yeah I

2514.76 --> 2525.26
kinda like it more the other food is

2521.45 --> 2529.609
really good sir but the country itself

2525.26 --> 2532.1800000000003
is just dying kinda I mean nothing works

2529.609 --> 2536.15
there so I rather stay in suruc until

2532.18 --> 2539.3289999999997
maybe maybe the politics in Italy will

2536.15 --> 2545.71
settle down to why I don't know

2539.329 --> 2550.069
something kind of reasonable thing right

2545.71 --> 2551.299
let's see hey I had a question by the

2550.069 --> 2554.66
ways in there you were in Switzerland

2551.299 --> 2558.769
right or I'm right now in Switzerland

2554.66 --> 2562.16
right do do you know if Switzerland

2558.769 --> 2565.0389999999998
fluoridated water because I heard that

2562.16 --> 2568.549
from somebody in Switzerland but it's

2565.039 --> 2572.6600000000003
some time ago maybe change was like ten

2568.549 --> 2574.579
years ago and she said that they did

2572.66 --> 2587.17
thurid eight the water did they do that

2574.579 --> 2589.88
I would be very good to find out yeah I

2587.17 --> 2592.91
honestly don't know I mean the tab

2589.88 --> 2595.7000000000003
letters tastes great but you know I

2592.91 --> 2600.41
don't know if they do it or not I mean

2595.7 --> 2603.68
they depends I guess maybe if they do at

2600.41 --> 2606.049
some parts maybe some parts they kinda

2603.68 --> 2607.7
take more from the mountain more you

2606.049 --> 2611.72
know the natural one and then they mix

2607.7 --> 2614.24
it with some of the of the clean water

2611.72 --> 2617.48
from those from the lake and from the

2614.24 --> 2620.6899999999996
rivers and so on but I conduct if you

2617.48 --> 2623.509
were good answer on it I don't know now

2620.69 --> 2625.279
once you mix in fluoride with water yeah

2623.509 --> 2629.14
you can dilute it but it's still gonna

2625.279 --> 2631.759
be in there and it is bioaccumulative so

2629.14 --> 2639.47
if I were you I would check that out

2631.759 --> 2641.66
make sure yeah that's not good even if

2639.47 --> 2646.25
it's just a microscopic amount

2641.66 --> 2648.68
it's still not gonna be good yeah I I

2646.25 --> 2656.6
think so

2648.68 --> 2660.1099999999997
oh um Alan my my my girlfriend my

2656.6 --> 2663.02
girlfriend she left me because while

2660.11 --> 2663.4700000000003
while we were in bed together I felt at

2663.02 --> 2664.88
her

2663.47 --> 2670.45
show me guest pressure without a

2664.88 --> 2673.13
container and what the [ __ ] then yeah

2670.45 --> 2676.4199999999996
now she left me it was just like an

2673.13 --> 2679.78
impulse you know I sometimes have this

2676.42 --> 2684.59
and sometimes just shout at people and

2679.78 --> 2689.7200000000003
like like prove the distance of the Sun

2684.59 --> 2696.01
and then you know this is correct you

2689.72 --> 2699.35
lost your girlfriend by shouting Nathan

2696.01 --> 2702.73
no it was a joke I would never do it

2699.35 --> 2708.74
just just wanted to say something stupid

2702.73 --> 2713.06
I mean I often say stupid things but you

2708.74 --> 2714.89
know I think the I didn't say something

2713.06 --> 2719.18
stupid for 15 minutes since I was on the

2714.89 --> 2723.65
show so yeah I don't know i think you're

2719.18 --> 2726.0499999999997
pretty reasonable maybe difficulty being

2723.65 --> 2730.1800000000003
reasonable when communicating face to

2726.05 --> 2732.9700000000003
face I don't know it's very different I

2730.18 --> 2737.87
I don't think I'm reasonable at all

2732.97 --> 2740.6
that's need to work on well that could

2737.87 --> 2743.54
be a sign of you genuinely being an

2740.6 --> 2745.4
idiot and magically being able to come

2743.54 --> 2748.4
across really reasonable these past

2745.4 --> 2750.7400000000002
months or you're just very self-critical

2748.4 --> 2754.82
and that's actually a good property if

2750.74 --> 2764.8999999999996
you don't let it overwhelm you you just

2754.82 --> 2768.2000000000003
called your guests an idiot terms of

2764.9 --> 2771.35
humor I think it's easier for me to make

2768.2 --> 2774.29
jokes in German that's really said other

2771.35 --> 2775.4
in making jokes in English is kind of

2774.29 --> 2776.9
hard sometimes

2775.4 --> 2781.67
Naza you're trying to be the first

2776.9 --> 2785.2400000000002
German comedian there are no other term

2781.67 --> 2789.98
comedians I think so no I didn't try it

2785.24 --> 2793.43
I I mean it's kind of new it's got a new

2789.98 --> 2796.279
thing for Germans like humor and comedy

2793.43 --> 2799.339
and so on so I don't I don't really want

2796.279 --> 2800.96
to get into it you know German comedy

2799.339 --> 2802.88
and English comedy are on completely

2800.96 --> 2806.18
different wavelength so if you're gonna

2802.88 --> 2810.589
try German jokes in English it's not

2806.18 --> 2814.069
gonna make a lot of sense in the tell us

2810.589 --> 2818.23
tell us a German joke in English mean

2814.069 --> 2824.45
are we will judge hmm Oh God

2818.23 --> 2827.39
Germans don't have any jokes god I have

2824.45 --> 2833.799
to translate it and it's just it was a

2827.39 --> 2833.799
joke I just heard like when I was 10 so

2836.33 --> 2843.89
[Music]

2838.18 --> 2851.9199999999996
is it dirty or not not too much I think

2843.89 --> 2856.94
um so god dammit it's really hard to it

2851.92 --> 2864.44
um right yeah so a did you just say it's

2856.94 --> 2868.579
really hard yeah yes alright

2864.44 --> 2875.0
no do not to think of the context again

2868.579 --> 2878.15
alright a a house he call this word

2875.0 --> 2880.089
logic it doesn't even exist a logic her

2878.15 --> 2884.059
no it doesn't exist

2880.089 --> 2889.5389999999998
oh it doesn't even exist I wanted to

2884.059 --> 2899.079
describe what the word supposed in I

2889.539 --> 2902.059
have to translate it in a load logician

2899.079 --> 2906.65
does it exist no Jason

2902.059 --> 2908.65
no Jason know it yeah it's it's some

2906.65 --> 2914.26
like a mess

2908.65 --> 2915.7000000000003
but someone who about logic right why

2914.26 --> 2918.36
did the dead that joke already died

2915.7 --> 2920.0499999999997
never mind

2918.36 --> 2922.9900000000002
it's too late

2920.05 --> 2926.4700000000003
this is brilliant allocation is a person

2922.99 --> 2931.06
whose topic of scholarly study is logic

2926.47 --> 2933.6099999999997
all right I didn't know that I I had to

2931.06 --> 2940.36
put it in Google Translate to find out

2933.61 --> 2945.82
what it is all right then so a logician

2940.36 --> 2953.29
and a mathematician talk together and

2945.82 --> 2956.38
the d logician as the met the in

2953.29 --> 2960.5099999999998
addition as the metalmouth metal [ __ ]

2956.38 --> 2968.8900000000003
[ __ ] the audition asks the metallization

2960.51 --> 2973.2700000000004
if he has if if he has a fish or if it

2968.89 --> 2978.93
has pets then the mathematician says yes

2973.27 --> 2981.16
so if you like if you like pets you like

2978.93 --> 2984.2999999999997
you like children

2981.16 --> 2988.5699999999997
right so he says yes if you like

2984.3 --> 2993.73
children you like women don't you and

2988.57 --> 2997.03
then he says yes so the mathematician

2993.73 --> 2997.51
then things all this or everything makes

2997.03 --> 3002.3100000000004
sense

2997.51 --> 3005.76
so he he goes in a bar and asks the

3002.31 --> 3009.17
barkeeper do you do you have pets and

3005.76 --> 3013.26
then he says no and then he says well

3009.17 --> 3018.84
what what the [ __ ] dude [ __ ] I've I

3013.26 --> 3021.51
messed up dude sorry I I don't even know

3018.84 --> 3024.9
the words ah what the [ __ ] you do you

3021.51 --> 3025.4700000000003
are a [ __ ] and then yeah so perfect yeah

3024.9 --> 3029.61
I get it

3025.47 --> 3037.9199999999996
you forced it to me and everyone had to

3029.61 --> 3040.6200000000003
listen now you force it to me and now

3037.92 --> 3043.4
everyone had to pay the price to who

3040.62 --> 3043.4
listen to it

3047.309 --> 3055.799
it's a complete stupid joke it's it's

3051.22 --> 3055.799
it's all right everyone

3056.549 --> 3062.589
don't be so self-conscious no it was a

3059.47 --> 3064.839
good joke it was kind of slow the way

3062.589 --> 3067.859
you translate words I get the joke it's

3064.839 --> 3070.9
funny it's basically showing how

3067.859 --> 3074.14
mathematicians can reason out anything

3070.9 --> 3076.599
to be logical and then on deduction

3074.14 --> 3080.0789999999997
based reasoning approach things in

3076.599 --> 3084.369
advanced presumptively and in this case

3080.079 --> 3086.4990000000003
completely missed the target by assuming

3084.369 --> 3087.099
that the man was gay because he didn't

3086.499 --> 3093.029
like pets

3087.099 --> 3093.029
it's the day job

3094.42 --> 3102.69
no I I'm kind of happy with the job

3096.999 --> 3107.0789999999997
right now so I'd rather stay there I

3102.69 --> 3110.4990000000003
mean they pay me for everything they pay

3107.079 --> 3114.9990000000003
me for the way I have to take like the

3110.499 --> 3120.4889999999996
to work they pay me a lot of money for

3114.999 --> 3123.4599999999996
food everything they they they even they

3120.489 --> 3125.38
even pay me for everything I have to

3123.46 --> 3129.67
write down at the end of the evening

3125.38 --> 3131.4990000000003
writes for the for everything I mean I

3129.67 --> 3133.809
can it's kind of working for the

3131.499 --> 3137.9689999999996
government but it isn't the government

3133.809 --> 3137.969
it's just found about the government so

3146.91 --> 3153.1499999999996
more County like it's it's kind of more

3149.769 --> 3162.549
founded by it's more funded by the

3153.15 --> 3165.609
county and the sex the little right in a

3162.549 --> 3170.38
city you have like the district sullen

3165.609 --> 3173.819
or right districts in term right alright

3170.38 --> 3173.819
so it's basically

3175.989 --> 3185.119
the social infrastructure related

3180.41 --> 3188.45
probably right I work with all people I

3185.119 --> 3192.7690000000002
a kind of em there and I I talked to

3188.45 --> 3196.5789999999997
them and I kind of give it's more

3192.769 --> 3197.839
psychological thing right people with

3196.579 --> 3202.7290000000003
dementia and so on

3197.839 --> 3204.499
yeah support them alright then yeah go

3202.729 --> 3208.64
there talk there and then write down and

3204.499 --> 3211.7889999999998
see how how how they change right how

3208.64 --> 3214.3689999999997
