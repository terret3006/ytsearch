2.48 --> 9.32
and welcome back hello hello Flat Earth

6.48 --> 14.48
early bird

9.32 --> 17.52
1763 B my internet just got completely

14.48 --> 20.240000000000002
disconnected I had to like restart

17.52 --> 23.84
everything so

20.24 --> 26.519
yeah let's just wait till the chat Finds

23.84 --> 26.519
Its way

28.96 --> 34.92
back

31.56 --> 34.92
because it's a new chat

36.54 --> 41.759
[Music]

57.01 --> 60.73
[Music]

58.92 --> 66.59
to

60.73 --> 66.59
[Music]

70.56 --> 73.43900000000001
ah Bill KN

73.479 --> 78.15899999999999
s borders boy yeah good to see

79.56 --> 85.68
you yeah hopefully that doesn't happen

82.28 --> 85.68
again it's quite

88.84 --> 91.84
disruptive

97.68 --> 103.04
yeah not that it was interrupting any

100.6 --> 104.479
riveting conversation or anything I mean

103.04 --> 107.84
time zones

104.479 --> 107.84
woohoo but

111.04 --> 117.0
uh yeah if the other chats still open by

114.64 --> 119.56
the way if you could please tell or let

117.0 --> 121.84
link them through to this one would be

119.56 --> 121.84
great

126.24 --> 131.79999999999998
if it's still open hey akumu virus good

129.44 --> 131.8
to see

133.44 --> 140.28
you all right so let me do some actual

136.04 --> 140.28
moderation now as I was about to

143.28 --> 148.56
do before the internet suddenly got shut

148.76 --> 151.76
down

162.82 --> 166.15
[Music]

189.56 --> 194.72
yeah when I say moderation and it takes

191.48 --> 197.39999999999998
some time that's actually me checking if

194.72 --> 199.56
not people are banned that shouldn't be

197.4 --> 203.31900000000002
banned because somebody's just Shadow

199.56 --> 203.319
Banning people that show up in my

205.519 --> 212.439
chat that's still going

208.68 --> 214.28
on In Waves though but it's quite

212.439 --> 217.56
annoying

214.28 --> 221.799
because regulars that like typically

217.56 --> 224.56
show up they just get banned without me

221.799 --> 224.56
yeah without any

225.239 --> 229.76
notice there's no notification anywhere

228.0 --> 234.12
that that's happening they just

229.76 --> 234.12
disappear ah here Jason mccor just

238.68 --> 241.959
gone not

249.799 --> 255.639
anymore I still have to press save

253.92 --> 259.32
though

255.639 --> 259.32
uh not there

260.919 --> 267.639
yet the funny thing about doing this is

263.8 --> 271.6
I do literally by doing this

267.639 --> 271.6
memorize all the trolls

272.6 --> 276.8
like I'm I'm getting like this what do

274.6 --> 280.72
you call that like refle

276.8 --> 283.52000000000004
refra just exact recognition memory you

280.72 --> 288.8
just immediately recognize ah this

283.52 --> 290.639
is not just a random guy is is the

288.8 --> 294.12
troll

290.639 --> 294.12
anyway hey Z

294.759 --> 300.47900000000004
tappy yeah YouTube's stalling a

298.56 --> 303.52
bit

300.479 --> 306.52
strict gun laws in the Netherland

303.52 --> 306.52
yeah

311.29 --> 316.91900000000004
[Music]

313.36 --> 316.91900000000004
very why do you

320.24 --> 323.48
[Music]

326.04 --> 331.47900000000004
[Music]

328.479 --> 331.479
ask

345.36 --> 351.88
you think there might be a war coming

348.24 --> 355.479
and what's the nature of this

351.88 --> 357.68
war because yeah I mean it's all over

355.479 --> 357.68
the

358.479 --> 361.479
place

375.85 --> 379.1
[Music]

383.72 --> 390.44000000000005
what was her nature the nature of World

386.88 --> 393.44
War II you don't know

390.44 --> 393.44
well

394.72 --> 401.0
look it just doesn't work like that

398.0 --> 403.479
now Wars become

401.0 --> 407.72
different but I mean there's still like

403.479 --> 407.71999999999997
plenty of hot Wars Happening

408.24 --> 413.88
Now Israel certainly not

411.919 --> 416.75899999999996
deescalate

413.88 --> 418.4
despite a lot of people trying to make

416.759 --> 421.40000000000003
it

418.4 --> 421.4
deescalate

422.22 --> 427.199
[Music]

425.36 --> 429.36
I'm just really curious as to what

427.199 --> 432.40000000000003
actually is going to happen since well

429.36 --> 435.039
nukes don't actually

432.4 --> 439.79999999999995
exist but there still as I've been

435.039 --> 441.479
saying like for years yeah years yeah

439.8 --> 444.879
nukes might not be real but they're

441.479 --> 448.31899999999996
still pretty damn big bombs

444.879 --> 449.91900000000004
and like they will be very

448.319 --> 452.56
destructive

449.919 --> 452.56
like don't

452.759 --> 458.12
worry might not all be blown up in a

455.44 --> 460.24
giant explosion that just vaporizes

458.12 --> 462.7
everything but I mean there will be

460.24 --> 471.36
things like utterly

462.7 --> 473.599
[Music]

471.36 --> 476.8
destroyed and I've seen like really

473.599 --> 478.919
crazy things in the dark world too that

476.8 --> 480.599
relate specifically to those types of

478.919 --> 484.919
things

480.599 --> 486.919
it's just that I have strong doubts like

484.919 --> 489.75899999999996
I had strong doubts even as I was

486.919 --> 493.08
witnessing that like whether

489.759 --> 493.08000000000004
that it's

499.84 --> 505.71999999999997
like I've like had a long suspicion that

503.879 --> 508.12
most of the things that I've been seeing

505.72 --> 508.12
were

508.24 --> 515.24
just like enactments of things that

511.84 --> 516.64
might be pretended to be happening but

515.24 --> 519.919
not actually

516.64 --> 523.36
happening in other word like actual

519.919 --> 526.399
faked things that are pretended to be

523.36 --> 526.399
real on the stage of

529.399 --> 535.68
history but I don't know we'll

532.12 --> 538.2
see I mean dude I've seen something

535.68 --> 542.04
that's that that defies

538.2 --> 542.0400000000001
all oh my

554.76 --> 560.079
understanding like it always weirded me

557.399 --> 563.76
out because I just got to see something

560.079 --> 567.04
that was emulated I guess it's just I've

563.76 --> 571.24
never seen anything like

567.04 --> 574.56
that like let me just describe it a

571.24 --> 578.76
crater that was so

574.56 --> 578.76
big you couldn't see the

578.8 --> 584.5999999999999
Horizon so it's like but it was on Earth

582.399 --> 587.72
but it just made everything completely

584.6 --> 591.839
surreal because it's like a crater that

587.72 --> 595.519
just starts goes to the side and it's so

591.839 --> 598.12
big that you just see black like that's

595.519 --> 599.57
you don't see the Horizon you just see

598.12 --> 602.729
black

599.57 --> 602.729
[Music]

602.92 --> 608.68
so from a preliminary analysis the

606.839 --> 610.2790000000001
suggestion was is that it's like a

608.68 --> 615.88
crater that

610.279 --> 615.88
was like hundreds of kilometers

617.68 --> 625.3199999999999
wide if not even bigger it was it was

621.56 --> 627.399
the way bigger than exists physically

625.32 --> 629.88
and thus if that happens it's going to

627.399 --> 631.519
be like a huge mark that literally

629.88 --> 634.8
changes everything

631.519 --> 638.2
forever cuz suddenly there's a this

634.8 --> 641.639
giant crater but I mean that's not it

638.2 --> 646.0400000000001
wasn't like a anything like an explosion

641.639 --> 646.04
crater it was like just a big

646.24 --> 653.6800000000001
hole not like boom wreckage everywhere

650.32 --> 658.0400000000001
like a giant dump of material that was

653.68 --> 661.04
all no it was like disintegrated or

658.04 --> 661.04
something

665.36 --> 671.639
afterward I puzzled together that it was

668.56 --> 674.8
probably suggested to be like what do

671.639 --> 678.6800000000001
you call an antimatter bomb or something

674.8 --> 678.68
if that if that is even a real

685.04 --> 690.4399999999999
thing so it's not an impact it's not

687.839 --> 692.48
like oh it's a giant coming down no it's

690.44 --> 695.2
like some kind of freaking

692.48 --> 699.0
device really

695.2 --> 700.88
big like as big as a power

699.0 --> 704.279
plant and

700.88 --> 707.48
that supposed to do

704.279 --> 710.079
that like an yeah I mean it all just

707.48 --> 712.24
looked to totally science fiction I'm

710.079 --> 713.6389999999999
just really surprised I haven't actually

712.24 --> 716.72
come

713.639 --> 720.639
across the movie about it yet because a

716.72 --> 724.639
lot of Dark World Vision type

720.639 --> 727.519
things I've come to have found back in

724.639 --> 729.9590000000001
movies like apparently the things that

727.519 --> 731.76
were shown to me were a lot of the times

729.959 --> 734.8389999999999
grafted together from

731.76 --> 736.8
movies especially the torture Parts

734.839 --> 738.9590000000001
where I was supposed to be feeling

736.8 --> 742.7199999999999
anguish and all

738.959 --> 742.7199999999999
that right it's

742.839 --> 750.8800000000001
weird bigger than a fusion bomb yeah if

745.839 --> 750.8800000000001
you only knew what a fusion bomb is

751.079 --> 755.68
yeah the point is it's all science

753.199 --> 755.68
fiction

756.16 --> 763.519
now but before I got into any of that I

760.6 --> 766.0
saw that stuff in my vision very

763.519 --> 767.5600000000001
distinctly I still remember like the

766.0 --> 769.6
scene

767.56 --> 772.0
transitions because it was one of the

769.6 --> 773.9200000000001
earlier things I got to see and it

772.0 --> 777.839
really freaked me out like this is one

773.92 --> 782.4399999999999
of the things I got to see in 90 yeah

777.839 --> 783.6
97 and it was like pinned on me like

782.44 --> 787.72
what the

783.6 --> 790.519
[ __ ] like I was to blame for that

787.72 --> 795.0790000000001
supposedly like what what the hell why

790.519 --> 795.079
the [ __ ] am I blamed for something like

804.279 --> 811.399
that I actually told this story to Mark

807.16 --> 813.0
sergeant in 2016 on a Skype call I don't

811.399 --> 816.6
think he

813.0 --> 818.76
remembers was just like what a lot of

816.6 --> 820.44
people taught him a lot of crazy stories

818.76 --> 824.3199999999999
he said that too

820.44 --> 825.9590000000001
like like back then like everybody just

824.32 --> 828.5600000000001
called him up and just told them like

825.959 --> 831.0
the craziest

828.56 --> 834.2399999999999
stories cuz they thought like oh my God

831.0 --> 837.92
finally somebody that understands he had

834.24 --> 839.6800000000001
he really broke that open back then and

837.92 --> 842.16
I had it too it's like like whoa what

839.68 --> 844.2399999999999
the [ __ ] maybe he maybe Mark Sergeant

842.16 --> 848.56
understands my vision

844.24 --> 852.639
stuff so I just laid it on

848.56 --> 854.5999999999999
him but he was just like

852.639 --> 859.92
what like he

854.6 --> 859.9200000000001
was not really following it too much I

863.92 --> 869.3199999999999
think yeah just stop kumu virus that

867.92 --> 874.12
doesn't exist

869.32 --> 877.6
hydrogen bomb nuclear bomb it's all

874.12 --> 877.6
nonsense doesn't

879.02 --> 885.04
[Music]

881.24 --> 888.519
exist no nobody's downloading zy nobody

885.04 --> 888.519
else is home doing

889.199 --> 895.789
anything if it's real yeah that's

892.64 --> 895.789
[Music]

896.0 --> 902.72
cute I'm just weirded out that I saw

898.959 --> 904.04
something that I that I cannot like

902.72 --> 907.8000000000001
there's

904.04 --> 912.63
nothing I've ever seen in the real world

907.8 --> 915.8199999999999
that could explain the way it

912.63 --> 915.82
[Music]

917.68 --> 924.12
looked the sight of it is unlike

921.44 --> 925.8000000000001
anything I've ever seen and that's what

924.12 --> 928.839
scares me about

925.8 --> 931.519
it like how could I be seeing something

928.839 --> 933.8000000000001
that I cannot compare to anything I've

931.519 --> 933.8
ever

936.12 --> 939.759
seen if it's all

943.12 --> 948.6
simulated in

944.92 --> 951.399
in yeah in the Dark World you

948.6 --> 954.759
see you're not supposed to be seeing

951.399 --> 956.88
things that you've never seen before and

954.759 --> 959.8000000000001
like can't compare to anything if you

956.88 --> 962.8
see that you're that's a big

959.8 --> 962.8
trouble

969.4 --> 972.64
[Music]

974.319 --> 979.759
sign okay akumu virus yeah we get

987.519 --> 990.519
it

993.04 --> 999.92
yeah good and Y N signs and I and it's

996.079 --> 999.92
true they don't exist it's all

1000.36 --> 1003.639
nonsense but I

1004.16 --> 1011.519
mean the technology to effectively blow

1008.04 --> 1013.759
things up has

1011.519 --> 1016.16
advanced and it's it's going to get

1013.759 --> 1016.16
pretty

1017.48 --> 1022.6
bad

1019.12 --> 1025.12
it's just no giant explosion and and and

1022.6 --> 1027.16
radioactive fallout like that's that

1025.12 --> 1029.6
doesn't

1027.16 --> 1031.16
exist but I mean things are just going

1029.6 --> 1033.8799999999999
to blow

1031.16 --> 1036.24
up the world's going to start feeling

1033.88 --> 1039.16
more and more

1036.24 --> 1041.88
volatile because like when technology

1039.16 --> 1043.959
becomes so easy to just blow things up

1041.88 --> 1047.3190000000002
and people start doing it it just makes

1043.959 --> 1049.799
everything feel like yeah this is all a

1047.319 --> 1053.5
matter of time before this just blows

1049.799 --> 1054.6399999999999
up before somebody presses that

1053.5 --> 1057.6
[Music]

1054.64 --> 1061.64
button so don't worry there's going to

1057.6 --> 1065.6789999999999
be enough [ __ ] despair

1061.64 --> 1065.679
okay but nukes don't

1067.3 --> 1071.08
[Applause]

1069.0 --> 1073.08
[Music]

1071.08 --> 1077.08
exist yeah

1073.08 --> 1079.3999999999999
TNT TNT is chemical like dude there

1077.08 --> 1082.799
could potentially be weapons

1079.4 --> 1086.799
where like frequency weapons Beyond I

1082.799 --> 1090.2
mean Tesla even had that like where they

1086.799 --> 1091.8799999999999
could just with a beam just make things

1090.2 --> 1093.52
explode

1091.88 --> 1096.919
just

1093.52 --> 1099.0
boom it would just like alter the

1096.919 --> 1103.76
material or something that is right

1099.0 --> 1107.4
there to just create a giant explosion

1103.76 --> 1110.48
like comparable to transmuting the

1107.4 --> 1115.6000000000001
material into explosive material or

1110.48 --> 1115.6
something I don't know what how how

1124.64 --> 1129.2
exactly what evidence suggested nukes

1127.4 --> 1131.799
don't ex there's no evidence that

1129.2 --> 1135.32
suggest nukes exist

1131.799 --> 1138.44
Z there's no evidence that

1135.32 --> 1140.9189999999999
actually is satisfactory to prove that

1138.44 --> 1140.919
they do

1145.13 --> 1148.419
[Music]

1149.559 --> 1155.6789999999999
exist what about nuclear power plants oh

1152.2 --> 1158.0800000000002
yeah those exist I mean nuclear material

1155.679 --> 1162.2800000000002
exists what it seems to be doing is

1158.08 --> 1166.6789999999999
mostly just heating up stuff water makes

1162.28 --> 1170.76
water boil and that's used for driving

1166.679 --> 1170.76
turbines that's a nucle power

1170.96 --> 1178.8400000000001
plant now the heating reaction also

1175.039 --> 1181.52
tends to like over time split some of

1178.84 --> 1185.039
that water and create hydrogen as a side

1181.52 --> 1189.039
effect and like regular boiling of water

1185.039 --> 1192.4
right doesn't do that so there is some

1189.039 --> 1192.4
hydrogen gas

1192.48 --> 1197.24
off right and they have to make sure it

1195.24 --> 1198.38
doesn't collect because it's highly

1197.24 --> 1201.459
explosive

1198.38 --> 1201.459
[Music]

1201.559 --> 1208.6399999999999
but yeah it's overall very

1205.36 --> 1210.9599999999998
safe unless I guess like all the rods

1208.64 --> 1215.159
all like come together because then it

1210.96 --> 1215.159
starts melting and becomes basically

1217.4 --> 1223.76
uncontrollable allegedly but I mean with

1220.48 --> 1227.159
modern nuclear design modern plant

1223.76 --> 1229.96
designs I mean the plant designs

1227.159 --> 1233.0390000000002
from

1229.96 --> 1236.3600000000001
like 20 years or 40 years ago were

1233.039 --> 1238.919
already pretty damn good like a lot

1236.36 --> 1242.1999999999998
better than a lot of the very old ones

1238.919 --> 1242.2
from the earlier 20th

1243.28 --> 1249.9189999999999
century there was some yeah there have

1246.72 --> 1253.3600000000001
been issues like the what is it old

1249.919 --> 1255.1200000000001
chernobil plan right well the newer

1253.36 --> 1258.8799999999999
designs are

1255.12 --> 1260.799
like just way more like where literally

1258.88 --> 1264.679
if anything goes

1260.799 --> 1267.6
wrong it all like because nothing is

1264.679 --> 1269.679
working shuts down to a perfectly safe

1267.6 --> 1271.48
position so that literally nothing could

1269.679 --> 1274.5590000000002
ever go

1271.48 --> 1277.72
wrong you have to make extreme effort to

1274.559 --> 1281.52
make it go wrong because when it shuts

1277.72 --> 1283.88
down everything is automatically like

1281.52 --> 1286.08
nothing by all the machine has to keep

1283.88 --> 1289.48
it apart or something and if it stops

1286.08 --> 1291.52
then it goes no like exactly opposite so

1289.48 --> 1294.559
it's like when it shuts down everything

1291.52 --> 1297.52
is like automatically passively brought

1294.559 --> 1298.6789999999999
to perfect safety like that kind of

1297.52 --> 1301.96
those kind of

1298.679 --> 1306.3600000000001
systems they're super safe power like

1301.96 --> 1306.3600000000001
nuclear power plant designs super

1306.799 --> 1311.559
safe but you actually have to build them

1316.4 --> 1320.039
though yeah

1321.039 --> 1327.96
if there can be yeah don't think like

1324.44 --> 1333.039
that Dr just don't do

1327.96 --> 1333.039

[Music]

1497.32 --> 1499.76
ah

1523.48 --> 1529.1200000000001
right anyway so let's hope that what I

1526.52 --> 1531.6
saw in the Dark World that time and I

1529.12 --> 1533.9189999999999
did actually explore it and I saw a

1531.6 --> 1536.799
whole bunch of weird

1533.919 --> 1539.5200000000002
things things that in retrospect might

1536.799 --> 1542.52
technically be

1539.52 --> 1542.52
impossible

1544.72 --> 1551.919
because because certain people were

1549.0 --> 1554.32
alive like they wanted to explore it

1551.919 --> 1558.2
they wanted to explore the

1554.32 --> 1561.2
crater because it was well let's just

1558.2 --> 1564.52
say that the crater was deeper than the

1561.2 --> 1568.96
super Cola deep bore hole and it's not

1564.52 --> 1571.9189999999999
just a small hole it was like the entire

1568.96 --> 1573.76
thing but the people that literally

1571.919 --> 1577.0
communicated through the dark world that

1573.76 --> 1580.76
they wanted to explore it well they're

1577.0 --> 1583.399
dead those people aren't alive anymore

1580.76 --> 1583.399
as far as I

1584.72 --> 1591.799
know wait maybe I'm wrong let me

1590.2 --> 1594.799
[Music]

1591.799 --> 1594.799
check

1595.039 --> 1598.679
uh yeah I might be

1599.919 --> 1606.0800000000002
wrong yeah I mix him up no he wasn't he

1602.96 --> 1608.6000000000001
isn't that yet I don't don't even

1606.08 --> 1608.6
remember his

1609.559 --> 1616.08
name but yeah I'm like kind of worried

1613.96 --> 1620.52
that something like that might happen

1616.08 --> 1623.36
that could and I want to like dispense

1620.52 --> 1626.9189999999999
knowledge about it but I think that

1623.36 --> 1629.399
like if that's really happening the way

1626.919 --> 1631.159
it looked then like it's supposed to

1629.399 --> 1633.7199999999998
happen like nobody's actually going to

1631.159 --> 1633.72
stop it

1641.12 --> 1645.1589999999999

1892.919 --> 1899.3600000000001
somebody like in my moderator list

1896.24 --> 1899.36
but I

1899.399 --> 1906.6
mean I'm having doubts that that's

1903.0 --> 1906.6
actually the cause of

1916.159 --> 1919.159
it

1923.6 --> 1927.84
what are you talking about B

1934.72 --> 1940.88
boy is there some situation I'm not

1937.399 --> 1940.8799999999999
aware of what are you talking

1945.799 --> 1951.1589999999999
about oh

1948.639 --> 1953.1999999999998
right I almost

1951.159 --> 1956.919
forgot like

1953.2 --> 1962.1200000000001
what supermarket oh yeah

1956.919 --> 1962.1200000000001
Supermarket uh anything about that

1964.159 --> 1971.7990000000002
well they're just doing it

1968.679 --> 1971.799
so I

1976.039 --> 1979.039
mean

1985.0 --> 1990.36
update on the Christmas

1987.32 --> 1993.279
candy right well first they're having s

1990.36 --> 1995.32
Nicholas candy even during

1993.279 --> 1998.639
Halloween they they have been having it

1995.32 --> 2002.0
for quite a while so yeah they're just

1998.639 --> 2002.0
going ahead as planned

2003.919 --> 2009.8400000000001
and and I mean even though not a lot of

2007.2 --> 2012.519
people are actually buying it

2009.84 --> 2014.72
right people are are kind of sick of all

2012.519 --> 2014.72
the

2016.32 --> 2021.039
candy everything is already expensive

2018.799 --> 2024.679
enough as it is and they don't actually

2021.039 --> 2024.679
have money extra for

2026.039 --> 2030.919
candy right with the whole Easter

2035.96 --> 2038.96
situation

2043.679 --> 2052.399
right Easter of course being the other

2047.039 --> 2052.399
situation more to the northeast of the

2053.24 --> 2059.0789999999997
supermarket compared to the uh St

2056.04 --> 2059.079
Nicholas candy

2061.38 --> 2064.4590000000003
[Music]

2065.879 --> 2068.879
aisle

2069.37 --> 2072.42
[Music]

2085.839 --> 2090.04
right but they're doing it they're

2087.72 --> 2094.1189999999997
installing it they're I mean employees

2090.04 --> 2097.48
are all buying the St Nicholas candies

2094.119 --> 2100.0
themselves and they're just do doing it

2097.48 --> 2101.68
I mean there's a lot of threats from all

2100.0 --> 2105.0
sides but I think

2101.68 --> 2108.359
that I think they're just going to like

2105.0 --> 2112.16
just they're just doing it anyway

2108.359 --> 2115.3199999999997
and they're just putting on maximum

2112.16 --> 2118.44
hutzpah they're just doing

2115.32 --> 2120.599
it and there's a chance that they that

2118.44 --> 2124.0
they'll like sort of get away with it

2120.599 --> 2126.3590000000004
again I mean I remember the previous

2124.0 --> 2130.76
time when something like this happened

2126.359 --> 2134.839
it was almost identical it was just as

2130.76 --> 2137.28
outrageous many ways it was just the

2134.839 --> 2139.2
same [ __ ] because they just do the same

2137.28 --> 2142.2400000000002
[ __ ] over and over and over again I mean

2139.2 --> 2145.7599999999998
they have been doing that

2142.24 --> 2148.24
for more than half a

2145.76 --> 2152.98
century and they keep doing

2148.24 --> 2155.7999999999997
it so it doesn't really change that

2152.98 --> 2158.8
[Music]

2155.8 --> 2158.8
much

2161.72 --> 2167.64
no Zep tappy but we we didn't get rid of

2165.44 --> 2172.319
him but we figured out a way to deal

2167.64 --> 2176.5989999999997
with it we just give him a timeout of 24

2172.319 --> 2179.04
hours and he can't undo that he can

2176.599 --> 2180.7200000000003
unblock himself but he can't untime

2179.04 --> 2185.72
himself

2180.72 --> 2188.72
out so we basically broke his

2185.72 --> 2188.72

United n that's not a supermarket

2339.48 --> 2344.319
they're a supply chain you dummy get it

2362.88 --> 2368.8

know the uh what do you call

2455.319 --> 2463.0
it St Nicholas candy manufacturers no

2460.04 --> 2466.319
wait the other one Supermarket owners

2463.0 --> 2466.319
they don't really

2467.68 --> 2472.56
care like they they want to do it their

2470.48 --> 2474.52
way and their their strategy is to

2472.56 --> 2478.0
ignore

2474.52 --> 2481.7599999999998
everything when they do it and rather to

2478.0 --> 2483.24
agitate and manipulate just use soci

2481.76 --> 2486.96
yeah social

2483.24 --> 2488.3599999999997

deescalate so it's like yeah the right

2638.04 --> 2642.88
thing you have to do it doesn't actually

2639.72 --> 2644.5589999999997

2666.4 --> 2669.559
you know what they're going to

2672.599 --> 2679.7200000000003
do and I mean there are already like

2677.2 --> 2681.48
yeah Israel is getting surrounded by all

2679.72 --> 2684.68
these countries that are now all

2681.48 --> 2686.68
starting to speak up basically against

2684.68 --> 2689.48
what's happening and they're all like

2686.68 --> 2692.1189999999997
starting threatened but I mean when is

2689.48 --> 2694.96
that ever worked in the past seriously

2692.119 --> 2697.96
when has that worked in the

2694.96 --> 2697.96
past

2713.28 --> 2721.8390000000004
I'm asking it's an actual open

2717.119 --> 2724.88
question you know it's not a rhetorical

2721.839 --> 2727.88
question it's an open question like

2724.88 --> 2727.88
when

2752.16 --> 2757.8799999999997
anybody else got any smart

2754.88 --> 2757.88
ideas

2765.119 --> 2768.48
oh by the way that was the wrong

2770.7 --> 2773.8999999999996
[Music]

2776.28 --> 2784.559
button the UN should have went into

2779.0 --> 2784.559
Northern Island if they never do bter

2784.8 --> 2787.6800000000003
boy

2786.88 --> 2790.28
they

2787.68 --> 2794.91
go yeah I

2790.28 --> 2797.6800000000003
mean oh this the UN is freaking

2794.91 --> 2800.96
[Music]

2797.68 --> 2804.5589999999997
evil they they go into poor places to

2800.96 --> 2807.2
basically exploit them a lot of the time

2804.559 --> 2809.119
it's like yeah they they say they're

2807.2 --> 2812.52
going to

2809.119 --> 2814.8
help but they only help if there is

2812.52 --> 2817.8
other business that they can

2814.8 --> 2817.8
do

2825.319 --> 2831.5589999999997
right that's what in my experience it it

2828.72 --> 2834.319
seems to work like that's what they do

2831.559 --> 2837.76
they're act they're supposedly a

2834.319 --> 2841.92
piece a piece upholding group but

2837.76 --> 2844.0400000000004
they're actually an exploiting group

2841.92 --> 2846.28
that's kind of just using piece as a

2844.04 --> 2849.64
cover and if they can't exploit then

2846.28 --> 2852.28
they don't do it they'll just say things

2849.64 --> 2852.2799999999997
and not do

2863.64 --> 2868.52
anything hey D Studio 68 good to see

2874.72 --> 2877.72
you

2879.02 --> 2882.699
[Music]

2904.64 --> 2907.64
for

2924.15 --> 2931.96
[Music]

2934.599 --> 2937.599
e

2943.2 --> 2948.96
right but I mean yeah I could try to

2945.92 --> 2951.319
predict what what's sort of going to

2948.96 --> 2954.559
happen it's not going to make anybody

2951.319 --> 2956.839
happen happy but I mean when has

2954.559 --> 2959.88
anything that's actually happened there

2956.839 --> 2964.52
ever made anybody happen

2959.88 --> 2967.359
that I besides like oh getting

2964.52 --> 2970.0
rich because of War

2967.359 --> 2972.319
profits military industrial complex or

2970.0 --> 2974.88
something right but I

2972.319 --> 2977.16
mean whatever is going to happen there

2974.88 --> 2981.28
trust me nobody's going to be happy

2977.16 --> 2983.3999999999996
about it yeah like every

2981.28 --> 2985.1600000000003
time that's why everybody likes to

2983.4 --> 2988.92
forget about it because every time

2985.16 --> 2993.04
something happens there nobody gets

2988.92 --> 2993.04
happier except for war

2994.52 --> 2997.52
profiteers

3021.599 --> 3028.319
right so the rough what I think rough

3024.559 --> 3030.3590000000004
transcrip script of what would happen I

3028.319 --> 3033.52
think that just like they're just going

3030.359 --> 3036.04
to keep going doing all this stuff

3033.52 --> 3040.44
supposedly following

3036.04 --> 3042.44
their the plan that was unrolled but I

3040.44 --> 3045.359
mean the plan that's unroll is only

3042.44 --> 3049.319
there to to

3045.359 --> 3052.16
like prevent the legal measures from

3049.319 --> 3055.24
getting to the sitting president like

3052.16 --> 3058.24
that's like it's been going around like

3055.24 --> 3060.5989999999997
people people are aware of that that

3058.24 --> 3063.64
have like really looked into it studied

3060.599 --> 3066.6800000000003
into that sort of thing like he's just

3063.64 --> 3071.24
doing all of this just as his like his

3066.68 --> 3073.48
final H I'm a big man kind of maneuver

3071.24 --> 3074.8799999999997
because after it's over and it will

3073.48 --> 3077.27
eventually be

3074.88 --> 3078.799
over the guy is going to go to

3077.27 --> 3082.2
[Music]

3078.799 --> 3084.88
jail I mean that's that's already pretty

3082.2 --> 3088.24
much established there like there's

3084.88 --> 3092.119
nothing that can prevent that from

3088.24 --> 3095.2799999999997
happening so he's now

3092.119 --> 3097.92
just having his final go of showing up

3095.28 --> 3101.28
how B how much of a big shot he is and

3097.92 --> 3101.28
blowing people up and all

3106.44 --> 3111.559
that but I mean I don't think that

3108.92 --> 3114.359
anybody on the outside is really there

3111.559 --> 3118.079
to like nobody's going to actually

3114.359 --> 3121.52
attack I think they're just there to

3118.079 --> 3123.2400000000002
like let them know like yeah you can't

3121.52 --> 3127.44
get

3123.24 --> 3129.16
us you want that final war score or

3127.44 --> 3130.839
whatever but you can't get us and so

3129.16 --> 3134.68
they're all basically

3130.839 --> 3137.72
like surrounding in

3134.68 --> 3140.44
surrounding it basically but I don't

3137.72 --> 3143.2799999999997
think they're actually going to

3140.44 --> 3147.28
attack it's mostly just going to

3143.28 --> 3147.28
be the candy store

3149.92 --> 3156.96
but I don't know man they might do

3152.599 --> 3160.7200000000003
another they might do like weird

3156.96 --> 3163.44
just let Secret Service people in and

3160.72 --> 3164.64
and like take control over the military

3163.44 --> 3167.68
efforts

3164.64 --> 3170.0789999999997
on on the candy store side right that

3167.68 --> 3172.96
could all happen I don't

3170.079 --> 3175.2400000000002
know how much effort they're going to

3172.96 --> 3176.64
try to take to like [ __ ] around with

with that

3176.64 --> 3182.44
situation

3178.96 --> 3183.799

3182.44 --> 3186.28

tiger bear

3657.96 --> 3660.44
it all

3661.039 --> 3667.5200000000004
depends like if the culture is good with

3663.96 --> 3672.319
the priesthood then I'd probably do that

3667.52 --> 3672.319
if the king is a noble one then that's

3675.559 --> 3681.079
great but both can be terrible if the

3678.2 --> 3683.4399999999996
leadership is terrible or

3681.079 --> 3686.44
culture

3683.44 --> 3686.44

3887.799 --> 3893.16
it's kind of a trick question

3890.559 --> 3896.1600000000003
though but my preference would generally

3893.16 --> 3896.16
go out to that

3909.039 --> 3911.96
a religious

3915.88 --> 3921.88
King all depends on and what he would do

3919.72 --> 3921.8799999999997
with

3923.079 --> 3929.039
it I mean pretty much any king would be

3930.559 --> 3934.48
religious if they were a proper King I

3932.88 --> 3937.599
mean what

3934.48 --> 3940.599
seriously like an atheist king or

3937.599 --> 3943.1600000000003
something what's that going to be it's

3940.599 --> 3943.1600000000003
just another

3945.119 --> 3951.6400000000003
Grappler if they don't have any other

3947.359 --> 3951.64
Mission than to just be in power

3952.24 --> 3959.359
and and get more money or whatever I

3956.079 --> 3962.7200000000003
mean real king is

3959.359 --> 3964.119
religious they always were there's no

3962.72 --> 3968.0789999999997
atheist

3964.119 --> 3968.079
Kings when they still had

3983.0 --> 3986.0
power

3986.96 --> 3990.219
[Music]

3992.599 --> 3999.839
subjective a priest

3996.119 --> 4002.119
king that all depends on what that

3999.839 --> 4004.599
means I mean if the king is going to

4002.119 --> 4004.599
create a

4004.64 --> 4009.1189999999997
theocracy well that's usually not

4011.16 --> 4017.279
great but if they'd be a proper King

4014.64 --> 4021.0389999999998
Guided

4017.279 --> 4023.599
by religious culture and all that well

4021.039 --> 4023.599
that could be

4031.319 --> 4037.279
great is that what Jesus is what are you

4034.96 --> 4037.279
talking

4042.92 --> 4045.92
about

4047.76 --> 4051.8390000000004
where how is he priest

4054.92 --> 4061.4
king is the king of

4058.48 --> 4064.0
kings that's all esoterics it's all

4061.4 --> 4067.119
spiritual like that's has nothing to do

4064.0 --> 4070.119
with actual Earthly legal

4067.119 --> 4070.119

morning yeah bet it

4102.839 --> 4105.839
is

4112.319 --> 4117.52
is supposed to rule over us a second

4114.719 --> 4120.199
coming well what if that was in the

4117.52 --> 4123.52
Renaissance what if his second coming

4120.199 --> 4123.5199999999995
was in

4124.159 --> 4128.04
France and it created the

4129.44 --> 4135.799
Renaissance ever considered

4132.799 --> 4135.799
that

4146.359 --> 4150.6
Rome said yeah I'm sure Rome

4150.839 --> 4157.12
said I say all kinds of things but I

4153.6 --> 4160.279
mean Jesus

4157.12 --> 4160.2789999999995
was a

4162.719 --> 4165.719
nobl

4179.92 --> 4184.7390000000005
but was he a

4181.26 --> 4184.7390000000005
[Music]

4192.719 --> 4195.719
king

4204.719 --> 4210.4800000000005
I mean the whole oh Rome said he was a

4207.52 --> 4213.2390000000005
king of Jews well could it be that it's

4210.48 --> 4214.32
just a bunch of Rome Grapplers that are

4213.239 --> 4218.599999999999
just

4214.32 --> 4218.599999999999
like he's a threat to our

4218.92 --> 4227.52
Authority so we'll just say he broke the

4223.239 --> 4230.919999999999
law by calling himself King right I mean

4227.52 --> 4234.0
that seems what's really

4230.92 --> 4237.4400000000005
happening like how the hell is Jesus how

4234.0 --> 4239.88
was he a king is he really a king I

4237.44 --> 4239.879999999999
don't think

4242.56 --> 4247.88
so I mean I bet there would be people

4245.36 --> 4252.639999999999
that wanted him to be a king I don't

4247.88 --> 4255.64
think that he actually planned to be

4252.64 --> 4255.64

it's ridiculous saying akumu

4363.48 --> 4366.44
there is no such a

4368.159 --> 4374.839999999999
thing like that's completely wrong

4371.48 --> 4376.199
there's God and

4374.84 --> 4380.6
there are

4376.199 --> 4383.239
Kings soon as you say I am a God and you

4380.6 --> 4385.52
make that legal then you're basically

4383.239 --> 4387.48
say it's like the same thing it's like

4385.52 --> 4390.92
that's like what Emperors do they

4387.48 --> 4395.879999999999
declare themselves God right it's just

4390.92 --> 4395.88
another competition to Kingdom to a

4399.679 --> 4405.04
King it's just that Emperors and people

4402.92 --> 4407.56
that think themselves as God are tend to

4405.04 --> 4407.56
be more

4408.719 --> 4413.92
megalomaniacal and more

4411.48 --> 4416.638999999999
ruthless cuz they don't think they have

4413.92 --> 4421.639
anything to justify

4416.639 --> 4424.639
toward because they are the one so it's

4455.12 --> 4460.84
one

4457.0 --> 4464.639
God and he does not show

4460.84 --> 4468.28
himself physically he has no incur

4464.639 --> 4468.28
ation it's just

4470.48 --> 4480.44
being right but I mean what Jesus shared

4476.04 --> 4485.44
was how we can be closer to God and be

4480.44 --> 4489.199
like Gods basically not be God like Gods

4485.44 --> 4492.879999999999
like sons of God little G like

4489.199 --> 4495.44
emphasizing with humility towards the

4492.88 --> 4498.2390000000005
TRU true real

4495.44 --> 4500.799999999999
God that's the

4498.239 --> 4503.36
idea the problem is that a lot of people

4500.8 --> 4507.84
that decare themselves God Emperor

4503.36 --> 4511.719
whatever are total atheist they or they

4507.84 --> 4514.360000000001
they do it because they think that they

4511.719 --> 4516.88
are the real God and that everybody's

4514.36 --> 4520.199
just talking nonsense to something that

4516.88 --> 4522.04
doesn't exist those are usually the the

4520.199 --> 4524.678999999999
the type of rulers that declare

4522.04 --> 4527.96
themselves a god

4524.679 --> 4530.719
because they don't actually respect

4527.96 --> 4533.2390000000005
religion or God or any of it so they

4530.719 --> 4535.719
think I just want that power and

4533.239 --> 4537.839999999999
admiration I just want everybody to do

4535.719 --> 4540.719
blindly what I tell them

4537.84 --> 4542.88
to cuz they don't see God they don't

4540.719 --> 4548.6
believe any of

4542.88 --> 4551.76
it right that's not what Jesus did Jesus

4548.6 --> 4555.46
merely laid down the esoterics of that

4551.76 --> 4558.88
like in in US is the

4555.46 --> 4563.2390000000005
[Music]

4558.88 --> 4566.8
potential that that God infused us

4563.239 --> 4570.879999999999
with to be his sons to be

4566.8 --> 4573.96
like illuminated and with

4570.88 --> 4576.8
insight about creation and about God's

4573.96 --> 4582.12
Will and like how it all works and how

4576.8 --> 4584.88
it's supposed to be to recognize what is

4582.12 --> 4587.4
what

4584.88 --> 4590.4400000000005
and to act

4587.4 --> 4593.638999999999
creatively and productively right L

4590.44 --> 4597.44
little Gods but that's very

4593.639 --> 4602.96
different and it's a esoteric view of

4597.44 --> 4602.96
things it's not literal it's not a legal

4612.08 --> 4615.08
declaration

4637.96 --> 4642.0
right so yeah that's just how I see

4639.72 --> 4644.52
[Music]

4642.0 --> 4647.639
it

4644.52 --> 4650.280000000001
and that's how I accept it like I think

4647.639 --> 4652.76
that everybody is a Son of

4650.28 --> 4656.84
God it's just

4652.76 --> 4660.96
that we end up rejecting the potential

4656.84 --> 4664.360000000001
that is given to us or we get caught in

4660.96 --> 4667.6
demons that basically ride along with us

4664.36 --> 4672.239
parasite on us to to limit us and we

4667.6 --> 4673.719
accept that because we think it is us

4672.239 --> 4675.959999999999
it's our ego

4673.719 --> 4678.36
through our ego like their demonic

4675.96 --> 4683.52
influence limit us they limit how much

4678.36 --> 4686.679
we can handle how much we accept is like

4683.52 --> 4688.96
the ego and good will that really is

4686.679 --> 4691.56
like a spiritual Dynamic and it seems

4688.96 --> 4694.6
like trivial to a person perhaps but

4691.56 --> 4697.6
it's actually really serious as a

4694.6 --> 4702.04
process and when you become more

4697.6 --> 4704.719
spiritually read and religiously studied

4702.04 --> 4707.32
then you understand how important that

4704.719 --> 4709.08
process actually is that when you're not

4707.32 --> 4710.96
studied you just think like yeah that's

4709.08 --> 4712.5599999999995
just what happens and doesn't really

4710.96 --> 4715.36
mean anything

4712.56 --> 4717.4400000000005
and just be pragmatic it's like oh if

4715.36 --> 4719.08
you go that direction things will

4717.44 --> 4720.96
probably go wrong and if you go this

4719.08 --> 4726.4
direction well then everybody will be

4720.96 --> 4726.4
happier and more proud and so yeah just

4727.32 --> 4731.92
pragmatic unless you get obsessed and

4729.8 --> 4734.92
then yeah

4731.92 --> 4734.92
well

4737.36 --> 4744.839999999999
but yeah I like that view I like where

4741.0 --> 4748.159
all little gods are you ready to

4744.84 --> 4748.159000000001
embrace your

4748.4 --> 4754.0
potential and do you realize that the

4751.4 --> 4756.32
more you do that the more likely it is

4754.0 --> 4758.36
that you will get to see things that are

4756.32 --> 4761.44
very burdensome to you that you'll have

4758.36 --> 4761.44
to carry with

4761.84 --> 4764.84
you

4765.0 --> 4768.92
to give them function and place within

4767.56 --> 4772.4800000000005
your

4768.92 --> 4772.4800000000005
understanding to

4774.04 --> 4777.32
evolve with

4779.159 --> 4784.0
them right and if you start bumping into

4782.44 --> 4787.759999999999
things and you can't handle it you

4784.0 --> 4790.48
reject them well then God basically

4787.76 --> 4794.12
protects you from that knowledge it's

4790.48 --> 4795.4
like is it a demon stop in you from

4794.12 --> 4797.44
understanding is like why are you so

4795.4 --> 4800.08
stupid why are you not getting this

4797.44 --> 4802.199
balard like yeah well maybe because God

4800.08 --> 4803.6
is literally protecting them not the

4802.199 --> 4807.08
devil but

4803.6 --> 4810.159000000001
God protecting them from like yeah but

4807.08 --> 4813.28
they can't actually handle this and

4810.159 --> 4813.28
that's why they're not

4816.92 --> 4821.76
understanding

4818.56 --> 4824.360000000001
so yeah maybe there is a time and a

4821.76 --> 4828.56
place

4824.36 --> 4831.88
to know things and that it is like part

4828.56 --> 4832.88
of the bigger plan of how things develop

4831.88 --> 4836.76
it's

4832.88 --> 4839.28
like you're supposed to see the world

4836.76 --> 4842.12
from different perspectives based on

4839.28 --> 4846.32
where your journey has led

4842.12 --> 4848.96
you and then if you're wise and sharp

4846.32 --> 4852.799999999999
and curious enough and eager enough

4848.96 --> 4855.08
then afterward you can really truly

4852.8 --> 4858.2390000000005
compare all those different perspectives

4855.08 --> 4858.239
that were completely

4858.32 --> 4865.599999999999
incompatible and understand it as a

4862.8 --> 4868.96
whole understand Consciousness itself

4865.6 --> 4871.1990000000005
and why it works the way it does from

4868.96 --> 4874.0
those different perspectives and then

4871.199 --> 4876.48
you'll be able to use that to recognize

4874.0 --> 4879.44
situations happening in other people you

4876.48 --> 4881.08
have your different perspectives that

4879.44 --> 4883.4
you experienced went through went

4881.08 --> 4886.96
through the mistakes went through the

4883.4 --> 4890.32
learnings you can then use that to

4886.96 --> 4892.76
identify processes of other people and

4890.32 --> 4896.159
potentially help guide

4892.76 --> 4898.679
them or help prevent cataclysm within

4896.159 --> 4900.28
them because you see it coming because

4898.679 --> 4902.679
you recognize the pattern because you

4900.28 --> 4905.759999999999
went through that even though it was

4902.679 --> 4909.08
wrong and you did wrong

4905.76 --> 4912.76
things by having gone through it you

4909.08 --> 4915.44
recognize it because people that go do

4912.76 --> 4919.1990000000005
wrong things most of the time they don't

4915.44 --> 4919.199
see that they're doing wrong

4922.08 --> 4928.199
things or they think it's necessary

4925.28 --> 4932.08
there's some kind of justification

4928.199 --> 4936.159
that prevents you

4932.08 --> 4936.159
from maneuvering against

4936.36 --> 4942.12
it temporary

4939.159 --> 4944.199
justifications that will over time like

4942.12 --> 4946.96
bleach you away and it's just like and

4944.199 --> 4949.638999999999
then you realize like wow I did all

4946.96 --> 4951.28
these things but the reason I did it was

4949.639 --> 4953.6
completely

4951.28 --> 4956.04
nonsensical or I was

4953.6 --> 4957.4400000000005
fooled but you were think you thought

4956.04 --> 4959.44
you were doing the right thing you were

4957.44 --> 4961.678999999999
trying to do the right

4959.44 --> 4963.678999999999
thing but it turns out you were

4961.679 --> 4966.6
completely delusional and even people

4963.679 --> 4968.92
that try to point that out I I took that

4966.6 --> 4972.360000000001
as offense I took them as they're trying

4968.92 --> 4974.92
to personally sabotage me even though

4972.36 --> 4977.799999999999
they're literally trying to prevent you

4974.92 --> 4979.159
from creating a cataclysm that you will

4977.8 --> 4984.0
have to face

4979.159 --> 4985.799999999999
later right all these processes very

4984.0 --> 4989.52
important to

4985.8 --> 4992.159000000001
understand and is the reason why I went

4989.52 --> 4993.76
through all these crazy phases including

4992.159 --> 4998.5199999999995
very dark

4993.76 --> 5001.6
ones I consciously chose it because like

4998.52 --> 5003.84
I need to understand that or it's going

5001.6 --> 5007.76
to be

5003.84 --> 5009.360000000001
like a a blocking blinding mystery

5007.76 --> 5013.400000000001
that's going to be forever out there and

5009.36 --> 5016.96
I'll spend my life trying to avoid evil

5013.4 --> 5018.96
instead of understanding and facing and

5016.96 --> 5022.56
dealing it with it and potentially

5018.96 --> 5024.8
getting it getting it away so that was

5022.56 --> 5024.8
the

5030.32 --> 5036.36
choice and even now after afterward some

5033.52 --> 5038.679
like every time I think about that it's

5036.36 --> 5042.4
like wow was

5038.679 --> 5044.84
such I really meant it it was really

5042.4 --> 5044.839999999999
very

5045.28 --> 5052.639
serious but afterward it's like I really

5049.12 --> 5056.639
completely didn't understand any of

5052.639 --> 5059.1990000000005
it when I was in there I really didn't

5056.639 --> 5063.4400000000005
understand I really was like desperate

5059.199 --> 5066.0
to like no it can't really be be evil

5063.44 --> 5068.4
like that there has to be a logical

5066.0 --> 5071.719
reason for it to exist I was

5068.4 --> 5071.719
basically like

5072.04 --> 5080.8
terrified that there might not be a

5075.8 --> 5080.8
logical God condone justification for

5081.639 --> 5087.84
evil because I couldn't handle that this

5085.199 --> 5090.36
is like one of my personal philosophical

5087.84 --> 5094.360000000001
struggles is that I couldn't handle that

5090.36 --> 5094.36
God created evil basically

5096.32 --> 5102.0
that it existed that the mechanisms of

5102.84 --> 5106.04
existence

5104.4 --> 5108.839999999999
like

5106.04 --> 5111.119
enables evil to

5108.84 --> 5113.8
exist that

5111.119 --> 5116.159
specifically that's the part where I'm

5113.8 --> 5118.88
like like that's where

5116.159 --> 5120.0
like like that's where I'm start to like

5118.88 --> 5123.8
get

5120.0 --> 5127.679
disjointed like I find it

5123.8 --> 5131.719
unacceptable in a way oh but it's my ego

5127.679 --> 5131.719
it turns out it's my ego that finds it

5134.56 --> 5141.4800000000005
unacceptable that reality physical

5137.04 --> 5145.0
reality is so enabling towards evil I'm

5141.48 --> 5147.44
not even talking about how people are or

5145.0 --> 5149.32
how societies are organized I'm talking

5147.44 --> 5150.96
about the

5149.32 --> 5153.28
freaking

5150.96 --> 5156.159
material thing

5153.28 --> 5160.639
what they are how they work what they do

5156.159 --> 5163.159
it's all very enabling to evil right the

5160.639 --> 5165.400000000001
whole freaking point about evil is that

5163.159 --> 5169.4
you could just have that amazing

5165.4 --> 5173.5599999999995
ultimate power and whatever

5169.4 --> 5178.5199999999995
sensation but then afterward most mostly

5173.56 --> 5181.04
or well inevitably it burns you

5178.52 --> 5185.56
out but it's still

5181.04 --> 5189.6
like if it's there the design of

5185.56 --> 5193.96
everything has been made for that to

5189.6 --> 5198.679
always be there be there as an

5193.96 --> 5198.679
option and it can really do

5198.96 --> 5206.56
damage is evil a creation now it's a

5203.719 --> 5208.56
pattern it's a pattern side effect of

5206.56 --> 5211.1990000000005
Free Will which is like an very

5208.56 --> 5214.1990000000005
important

5211.199 --> 5214.199
condition

5223.4 --> 5230.719
so yeah it's like God enables

5226.52 --> 5230.719
evil but he doesn't condone

5231.119 --> 5235.48
it yeah what do you think about

5240.36 --> 5245.119
that that would actually make a really

5242.84 --> 5245.119000000001
good

5245.22 --> 5249.439

5301.04 --> 5306.36
that

5303.44 --> 5306.36
okay I got a title

5306.48 --> 5312.678999999999
alteration I put it in there thought it

5309.28 --> 5312.679
was really good

5313.239 --> 5318.879999999999
saying God enables evil but it does not

5316.44 --> 5318.879999999999
condone

5321.119 --> 5324.679
it this free

5331.0 --> 5334.0
will

5345.239 --> 5350.48
could have gotten rid of it yeah but

5347.639 --> 5354.08
aumo virus like that's all very linear

5350.48 --> 5356.759999999999
time thinking like God getting rid of it

5354.08 --> 5360.639
if God would have to get rid of

5356.76 --> 5365.159000000001
something then why did it just not

5360.639 --> 5365.159000000001
prevent its coming into

5367.199 --> 5370.199
existence

5371.84 --> 5377.8
see if you'd have to let something play

5374.96 --> 5381.4
out to then stop it that makes no sense

5377.8 --> 5384.6
for a being that is literally

5381.4 --> 5386.36
Timeless something isn't supposed to be

5384.6 --> 5390.52
there

5386.36 --> 5390.5199999999995
then why did it come into

5413.32 --> 5418.28

day or or I'm just going to round out

5659.4 --> 5664.36
the show that could do that to hey we

5662.679 --> 5668.2390000000005
could talk a little

5664.36 --> 5670.679
longer or not really and oh you're off

5668.239 --> 5674.4
to work oh

5670.679 --> 5676.88
okay I guess a lot of people are just

working or whatever doing stuff on

5676.88 --> 5681.96
Sunday being busy with that hope the

5680.48 --> 5683.199
weather's not too bad for

5681.96 --> 5685.76
[Music]

5683.199 --> 5686.599999999999
you great mind unveiled videos three

5685.76 --> 5690.4800000000005
years

5686.6 --> 5692.84
ago about the Consciousness in the globe

5690.48 --> 5694.48
huh

5692.84 --> 5697.400000000001
I must have missed that one slowmo Moon

5698.92 --> 5701.92
interesting

5717.84 --> 5722.52
H they have a link for that by any

5720.719 --> 5725.4

I'll watch that thanks for the for the

5810.28 --> 5814.159
tip

5812.08 --> 5816.4
I wonder if I just skipped over this at

5814.159 --> 5816.4
the

5821.04 --> 5827.28
time cuz like in times when there's like

5823.88 --> 5829.76
a lot of new developments with fed or

5827.28 --> 5831.96
whatever right it's like oh we got a new

5829.76 --> 5835.0
argument or we got some new stuff then

5831.96 --> 5836.2390000000005
I'm like not really watching all these

5835.0 --> 5838.92
types of

5836.239 --> 5840.678999999999
channels I'm like no I'm just busy with

5838.92 --> 5842.4
this stuff I'm not like now going to

5840.679 --> 5844.639
watch some new

5842.4 --> 5846.679
project but then when there's not a lot

5844.639 --> 5849.52
going on well then I definitely pay

5846.679 --> 5852.4400000000005
attention so going to dig it okay cool I

5849.52 --> 5852.4400000000005
will I will check it

5853.119 --> 5858.96
out another Cabbage Patch related yeah

5856.239 --> 5863.839999999999
yeah no I talked about

5858.96 --> 5866.4
that on the first 11 minute video from

5863.84 --> 5868.4400000000005
today I just finished watching that

5866.4 --> 5870.199
before the early for before I started

5868.44 --> 5874.239
the early word

5870.199 --> 5874.239
show it's a crazy

5874.44 --> 5880.199
movie Patch Town what like

5882.83 --> 5889.76
[Music]

5885.599 --> 5892.639
what it's good it's freaky it's

5889.76 --> 5895.320000000001
basically they' reviewed a

5892.639 --> 5897.0
movie but with their knowledge and

5895.32 --> 5898.36
they're basically just laying out like

5897.0 --> 5901.84
what happens in the

5898.36 --> 5904.36
movie and how weird that is is it was a

5901.84 --> 5907.2390000000005
very interesting video to watch it was

5904.36 --> 5909.4
very entertaining it's almost like like

5907.239 --> 5912.4
one of the movie reviewers except this

5909.4 --> 5913.759999999999
one had really serious research to back

5912.4 --> 5917.799999999999
him and not

5913.76 --> 5917.8
just Hollywood

5918.4 --> 5924.0
uh thingies Hollywood knowledge or

5921.639 --> 5926.08
whatever it was it was a it was an

5924.0 --> 5926.73
interesting video definitely I checked

5926.08 --> 5929.99
that

5926.73 --> 5929.99
[Music]

5930.119 --> 5934.839999999999
out

5932.199 --> 5939.36
the dying of Helia centrism might be the

5934.84 --> 5939.360000000001
reason for age changes

5942.159 --> 5950.199
what the globe is so dark age I actually

5946.679 --> 5950.1990000000005
thought it was exactly the

5960.04 --> 5966.08
opposite the globe is like

5963.28 --> 5968.08
so

5966.08 --> 5970.32
Renaissance like that's when they made

5968.08 --> 5970.32
their

5979.36 --> 5985.759999999999
move would have to relearn stuff no no

5982.679 --> 5985.76
barely Akuma

5989.119 --> 5994.719
virus that's the whole point

5991.76 --> 5996.4400000000005
there's not much to relearn if you are a

5994.719 --> 5998.679
helio entr interest and you just have to

5996.44 --> 6001.36
realize the Earth is flat there's so

5998.679 --> 6004.4400000000005
little to learn you just have to let go

6001.36 --> 6008.44
of the nonsense that's all very little

6004.44 --> 6008.44
you have to relearn very very

6019.96 --> 6022.96
little

6026.8 --> 6030.719
unlearn would be more appropriate

6032.159 --> 6037.159
right it changes a lot of this no it

6035.199 --> 6040.598999999999
does

6037.159 --> 6043.199
not it does not change physics it does

6040.599 --> 6046.0
take away a lot of math that is complete

6043.199 --> 6046.0
horseshit and

6049.92 --> 6052.92
superfluous

6079.84 --> 6082.84
what

6086.56 --> 6093.360000000001
classical physics never fit the

6089.239 --> 6098.879999999999
globe well it did in a sense

6093.36 --> 6098.88
that no you're right it doesn't at all

6099.239 --> 6102.718999999999
sorry you're right

6103.52 --> 6109.719
clear what I mean the globe is all based

6106.239 --> 6113.119
off flat planes anyway it's all based on

6109.719 --> 6115.0
the Earth being measured flat

6113.119 --> 6118.0
calculated and then like the

6115.0 --> 6121.48
calculations are just bent into a

6118.0 --> 6123.8
ball very sloppily all based of flat

6121.48 --> 6123.799999999999
plane

6126.239 --> 6132.718999999999
measurements yeah if the Earth wasn't

6128.4 --> 6132.719
flat the globe model wouldn't

6134.719 --> 6139.96
work you think it will yeah yeah well

6137.84 --> 6142.679
yeah well I you I think that you could

6139.96 --> 6145.199
just work through the closet in Narnia

6142.679 --> 6149.719
and and be in another place I think that

6145.199 --> 6149.719
too doesn't mean that it's actually true

6152.91 --> 6160.159

6167.05 --> 6172.76

though

6173.87 --> 6177.199
[Music]

6177.599 --> 6183.0
yeah there's nothing more trippy than

6179.84 --> 6183.0
reality akumu

6183.119 --> 6189.5199999999995
virus yeah there's nothing more trippy

6185.76 --> 6194.08
than reality to people that can't handle

6189.52 --> 6194.080000000001
it cuz reality is

6198.08 --> 6203.5199999999995
surreal it really is

6202.36 --> 6207.799999999999
it's just

6203.52 --> 6211.080000000001
that what we think of as real is like

6207.8 --> 6213.88
assembl from internal mental

6211.08 --> 6216.4
processes and what we assume to be

6213.88 --> 6218.639
logical straightforward turns out to not

6216.4 --> 6219.879999999999
be so logical straightforward in

6218.639 --> 6224.1990000000005
physical

6219.88 --> 6227.4400000000005
reality it's all quite bizarre how

6224.199 --> 6229.96
physical reality Works what it actually

6227.44 --> 6232.159
turns out to be is very different from

6229.96 --> 6235.8
how your mind would

6232.159 --> 6235.799999999999
assemble its

6242.52 --> 6250.320000000001
understanding imagination is more trippy

6247.239 --> 6254.36
no imagination

6250.32 --> 6254.36
just assembling what is

6259.599 --> 6262.599
available

6273.32 --> 6279.04
now it's much more trippy in my opinion

6276.52 --> 6282.679
about how things in reality

6279.04 --> 6284.599
work when it's like you

6282.679 --> 6288.76
can't you

6284.599 --> 6292.599
can't understand how it works that way

6288.76 --> 6295.159000000001
but it does and like it's still

6292.599 --> 6297.88
completely

6295.159 --> 6300.5599999999995
unknown of things that are like right in

6297.88 --> 6303.0
your face all the time all the time

6300.56 --> 6307.400000000001
continually like Celestial lights it's a

6303.0 --> 6309.719
gigantic mystery what that is non local

6307.4 --> 6312.36
holographic light with different shadows

6309.719 --> 6315.88
being cast from different Observer

6312.36 --> 6319.28
points of the same apparent light

6315.88 --> 6322.08
source we can't explain how it works

6319.28 --> 6325.159
that way why works that way and we can't

6322.08 --> 6327.639
emulate that effect ourselves with

6325.159 --> 6332.04
technology that we can

6327.639 --> 6332.04
create and that is

6332.36 --> 6340.08
that it is surreal reality is provably

6337.36 --> 6341.839999999999
surreal and there's nothing you could do

6340.08 --> 6346.08
about

6341.84 --> 6349.0
it it's not imagination is the reality

6346.08 --> 6352.48
that is surreal it

6349.0 --> 6352.48
defies like normal

6352.52 --> 6357.320000000001
normaly it absolutely defies

6357.5 --> 6360.619
[Music]

6379.4 --> 6384.879999999999
normaly

6381.92 --> 6386.88
crazy aumu virus or just

6384.88 --> 6391.04
pointless yeah you can use your

6386.88 --> 6393.76
imagination for pointless chaotic Folly

6391.04 --> 6397.119
to entertain yourself yeah it and you

6393.76 --> 6401.52
think that's crazy or oh so

6397.119 --> 6405.639
Crea no actually understanding reality

6401.52 --> 6408.56
is much more bizarre and

6405.639 --> 6411.88
surreal then you like a little kid just

6408.56 --> 6415.159000000001
juggling around with platitude

6411.88 --> 6415.159000000001
that you think is really

6417.08 --> 6423.04
special the actual understanding of

6419.719 --> 6426.52
reality is much

6423.04 --> 6430.28
crazier is much more surreal there are

6426.52 --> 6433.280000000001
things provably there that defy all of

6430.28 --> 6437.28
our understanding and it's right there

6433.28 --> 6440.04
in your face all the time everybody's

6437.28 --> 6442.96
life it's always there in your face and

6440.04 --> 6446.56
no body can explain why it is the way it

6442.96 --> 6448.88
is it's always there right in your face

6446.56 --> 6452.400000000001
everybody every person that has ever

6448.88 --> 6458.0
lived have faced these Mysteries and

6452.4 --> 6458.0
nobody can explain why it works that

6462.48 --> 6467.678999999999
way I'm attempting

6464.719 --> 6470.119
it I'm attempting to at least establish

6467.679 --> 6473.36
like yeah non-local hologram yeah the

6470.119 --> 6475.4
the light that comes off it is not is

6473.36 --> 6477.839999999999
unique to The Observer so it's not

6475.4 --> 6482.96
actually there it's just apparently

6477.84 --> 6485.52
there and the appearance changes per the

6482.96 --> 6488.92
observer's

6485.52 --> 6492.719
position the actual position changes the

6488.92 --> 6493.59
apparent position and flow of light that

6492.719 --> 6496.72
comes from the

6493.59 --> 6496.72
[Music]

6499.239 --> 6505.478999999999
sun

6500.74 --> 6505.478999999999
[Music]

6506.159 --> 6511.28
yeah because reality defies

6508.76 --> 6515.1990000000005
normaly it really

6511.28 --> 6517.8
does the more real you allow yourself to

6515.199 --> 6522.159
get the more you

6517.8 --> 6524.08
realize that people that don't have that

6522.159 --> 6526.48
muscle in their Consciousness and their

6524.08 --> 6529.159
mind and that effort the will to go

6526.48 --> 6532.28
there that they just can't get a

6529.159 --> 6535.96
freaking grip they just can't get a gpar

6532.28 --> 6538.48
reality they just can't they're not

6535.96 --> 6543.76
capable of handling that oversight

6538.48 --> 6545.799999999999
they're not H able to handle the Sur

6543.76 --> 6549.1990000000005
reality of

6545.8 --> 6550.320000000001
reality and so they have mechanisms even

6549.199 --> 6553.638999999999
in their own

6550.32 --> 6557.119
brain that break the information down

6553.639 --> 6559.119
into a oversimplified version that

6557.119 --> 6562.0
fits

6559.119 --> 6564.239
normaly everybody then thinks of it the

6562.0 --> 6566.44
same way and so then if everybody

6564.239 --> 6568.718999999999
naturally comes to the same conclusions

6566.44 --> 6570.759999999999
about certain insights well then

6568.719 --> 6573.76
everybody just accepts okay so that's

6570.76 --> 6576.719
the way it is then because that's how we

6573.76 --> 6578.599
all come to that conclusion so that if

6576.719 --> 6580.36
you naturally come to that conclusion

6578.599 --> 6583.84
without anybody telling you well then

6580.36 --> 6586.839999999999
that must be real then yeah like the

6583.84 --> 6589.639
Moon it has to be a damn rock with holes

6586.84 --> 6592.96
in it and it has a shadow cuz everybody

6589.639 --> 6595.92
looks at it and thinks

6592.96 --> 6597.56
that right even though there is no

6595.92 --> 6600.04
actual proof at

6597.56 --> 6603.56
all but normal

6600.04 --> 6607.36
see how the mind operates how interpret

6603.56 --> 6609.52
things yeah it it pushes you to do that

6607.36 --> 6611.28
and people before they know it they look

6609.52 --> 6614.400000000001
at it they think about it a little bit

6611.28 --> 6616.0
and then they just accept it's a rock

6614.4 --> 6618.638999999999
even though they don't have actual

6616.0 --> 6621.599
evidence for it because their

6618.639 --> 6624.76
senses because their mind their

6621.599 --> 6627.88
brain as it interpreted the information

6624.76 --> 6630.4800000000005
told them it has to be a rock not

6627.88 --> 6632.639
because there is evidence for it but

6630.48 --> 6634.879999999999
because their brain simply doesn't know

6632.639 --> 6637.32
how to size up the information

6634.88 --> 6639.719
differently and more objectively it

6637.32 --> 6639.719
doesn't

6642.28 --> 6648.079
know the conscious bypasses it and

6645.199 --> 6648.079
leaves it to the

6649.04 --> 6652.04
subconscious

6669.36 --> 6672.639
matter is confirmed I don't know if you

6671.36 --> 6675.799999999999
could say it I don't even know what

6672.639 --> 6675.8
that's supposed to mean tiger

6677.52 --> 6683.84
bear wow yeah I'm going to give myself a

6681.32 --> 6686.36
timeout for five minutes

6683.84 --> 6689.119000000001
because video YouTube seems to be

6686.36 --> 6693.92
stalling so badly now that I just can't

6689.119 --> 6693.92
even see where I'm at anymore in the

6695.76 --> 6700.88
video I hope you guys don't have that

6698.32 --> 6703.44
issue but it seems to be really pounding

6700.88 --> 6705.719
my computer right

6703.44 --> 6708.96
now so I think I'm just going to round

6705.719 --> 6710.4800000000005
out the show because I really want some

6708.96 --> 6712.2390000000005
lunch

6710.48 --> 6715.839999999999
and I think that I made my point

6712.239 --> 6719.199
blatantly clear about The Surreal nature

6715.84 --> 6723.28
of reality it is it is surreal the

6719.199 --> 6725.799999999999
actual reality is surreal it is now

6723.28 --> 6729.5599999999995
brain won't typically be able to handle

6725.8 --> 6733.4800000000005
that so there will be a normaly towards

6729.56 --> 6736.360000000001
reality based on how the brain naturally

6733.48 --> 6740.718999999999
interprets that

6736.36 --> 6742.5599999999995
reality and makes it simpler makes it

6740.719 --> 6747.159
adapt to that

6742.56 --> 6747.159000000001
normaly I am here to bypass all

6747.719 --> 6753.52
normaly I hope you guys have realized

6751.639 --> 6757.2390000000005
the truth of that

6753.52 --> 6760.079000000001
statement that is what I do

6757.239 --> 6763.239
universally I always go to those places

6760.079 --> 6765.5199999999995
that everybody else passes by and like

6763.239 --> 6765.5199999999995
is

6765.599 --> 6772.32
this is could it be that everything is

6770.119 --> 6774.04
actually completely different based on

6772.32 --> 6776.799999999999
this perspective right over here that

6774.04 --> 6778.92
nobody ever takes a look at that's what

6776.8 --> 6780.4400000000005
I do that's what I do with my early bird

6778.92 --> 6782.079
show that's what I've been doing on

6780.44 --> 6787.0
YouTube since I came here is what I've

6782.079 --> 6790.5199999999995
been doing off YouTube my entire

6787.0 --> 6790.52
life it's what I

6793.079 --> 6798.48
do take a look in doors that nobody ever

6798.599 --> 6802.159000000001
opens because

6800.719 --> 6804.96
they're too

6802.159 --> 6806.44
busy or they're just used to walking

6804.96 --> 6810.599
past

6806.44 --> 6815.36
it or they don't even see it's

6810.599 --> 6815.360000000001
there right and that's what I

6815.8 --> 6821.079000000001
do so I hope you all appreciate that

6819.199 --> 6824.48
that I actually do that and you come

6821.079 --> 6826.96
back for more and find things find

6824.48 --> 6830.0
things that you can say

6826.96 --> 6833.4800000000005
and like you can literally like a cat

6830.0 --> 6836.4
put things in front of me and then I'll

6833.48 --> 6839.678999999999
just give my judgment my insight I will

6836.4 --> 6841.638999999999
Oracle it I will give you my oracles

6839.679 --> 6843.4400000000005
judgment

6841.639 --> 6846.96
my my

6843.44 --> 6850.079
insights what do I

6846.96 --> 6851.96
see it's what I do and I hope you guys

6850.079 --> 6854.079
appreciate that and I really also hope

6851.96 --> 6856.44
that you guys will actually support me

6854.079 --> 6856.44
for

6857.119 --> 6866.04
that because yeah financially uh I'm not

6860.719 --> 6866.04
doing super super great I mean I've been

6867.96 --> 6872.8
worse but I still need support to

6870.599 --> 6874.679
literally get by it stopped buffering

6872.8 --> 6878.079000000001
for a few minutes ago yeah of course

6874.679 --> 6878.079
because I'm running out to show

6883.56 --> 6887.159000000001
now of course it

6888.679 --> 6891.679
is

6892.599 --> 6900.28
you respect my opinion on what's more

6895.04 --> 6900.28
crazy okay akumu virus I appreciate

6900.84 --> 6903.84
that

6914.639 --> 6922.0
right any more things that

6918.599 --> 6923.639
guys want to bring to my attention

6922.0 --> 6928.4
anything that's going to

6923.639 --> 6930.32
happen over the the rest of the day did

6928.4 --> 6932.159
everybody watch ball busters yesterday

6930.32 --> 6935.32
it was a great

6932.159 --> 6937.96
show I was much more energetic than I

6935.32 --> 6937.96
thought I would

6942.11 --> 6947.799
[Music]

6948.4 --> 6954.92
be what was it about

6951.32 --> 6956.96
refraction it was fully like refraction

6954.92 --> 6962.76
terrestrial

6956.96 --> 6962.76
refraction based show very focused very

6977.88 --> 6983.400000000001
informative illusion no no there is

6981.159 --> 6987.079
always a

6983.4 --> 6989.679
choice there always is it's

6987.079 --> 6992.679
just what are you going to what do you

6989.679 --> 6996.0
want to achieve with making the choice

6992.679 --> 6999.88
right and then with certain

6996.0 --> 7003.719
directives then Choice seems to become

6999.88 --> 7005.84
an illusion but it isn't though never is

7003.719 --> 7007.44
an illusion you can always choose

7005.84 --> 7009.28
something you can always choose to do

7007.44 --> 7010.36
the wrong thing you can always choose to

7009.28 --> 7012.96
die

7010.36 --> 7014.4
die right you can choose those things

7012.96 --> 7017.599
you

7014.4 --> 7022.36
can it's not an

7017.599 --> 7024.56
illusion it just seems to be an illusion

7022.36 --> 7028.759999999999
because

7024.56 --> 7033.84
logic if you're Guided by it just

7028.76 --> 7033.84
doesn't allow you to make illogical

7034.84 --> 7039.96
choices

7037.239 --> 7043.199
yeah but that's because you Sur rendered

7039.96 --> 7045.56
the actual choice to the logic and then

7043.199 --> 7049.159
that seems like there is no choice but

7045.56 --> 7051.56
there still is you're just Guided by

7049.159 --> 7053.879999999999
certain principles that don't leave you

7051.56 --> 7053.88
much

7054.9 --> 7059.598999999999
[Music]

7057.28 --> 7062.44
choice anyway I'm not going to have this

7059.599 --> 7064.119000000001
entire discussion video stop started

7062.44 --> 7066.759999999999
stalling again

7064.119 --> 7069.36
so I am going to round out and going to

7066.76 --> 7071.2390000000005
have some lunch so thanks everyone

7069.36 --> 7072.96
everyone for coming I hope you like this

7071.239 --> 7075.4
show I thought it was

7072.96 --> 7077.28
great despite all the stalling I think

7075.4 --> 7079.719
that watching it back without the

7077.28 --> 7081.92
stalling may turn out to be a very

7079.719 --> 7085.119
interesting show

7081.92 --> 7087.76
today subjectwise it was at

7085.119 --> 7090.32
least right so if you like this show

7087.76 --> 7092.719
today then please don't forget to Rogan

7090.32 --> 7094.4

amdam time in the weekdays and 2 pm.

7101.28 --> 7106.079
Amsterdam time in the weekend and please

So any support would be great it will

7114.84 --> 7120.32

1764 on a Monday so it's going to be

7133.32 --> 7139.84
back to 1: p.m. Amsterdam

7136.199 --> 7141.759999999999
time which is yeah two people in the

7139.84 --> 7143.679
United States probably going to be just

7141.76 --> 7145.88
like as if it were two because there is

7143.679 --> 7148.4800000000005
still the time shift that happened for

7145.88 --> 7151.32
this week at

7148.48 --> 7153.879999999999
least so I guess the early bird show is

7151.32 --> 7157.36
going to be later on

7153.88 --> 7159.8
average or the same amount of late I
