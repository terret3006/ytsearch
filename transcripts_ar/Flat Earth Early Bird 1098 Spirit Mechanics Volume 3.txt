a little late

98.32 --> 103.439
the weather today is yeah

100.4 --> 106.159
completely different

103.439 --> 107.75899999999999
big gray soup

106.159 --> 109.92
with rain

107.759 --> 114.84
or rather it's like

109.92 --> 114.84
micro droplets floating around

114.88 --> 120.479
to see in the distance like it's looking

117.2 --> 120.479
kind of misty because of it

120.56 --> 124.24000000000001
but yeah it's been this

122.64 --> 125.28
gray

124.24 --> 129.84
soup

125.28 --> 129.84
and rainy pretty much the entire night

131.44 --> 134.959
what a contrast to yesterday

135.36 --> 138.72000000000003
right does

136.72 --> 140.84
it's not looking super appealing out

138.72 --> 143.28
there it's like oh man

140.84 --> 146.239
let's get this

143.28 --> 150.08
walk outside it must be great

146.239 --> 150.08
it's probably cold and moist

150.4 --> 153.56
all right

156.72 --> 163.04
low service day definitely first in chat

159.84 --> 163.04
and on time indeed

166.8 --> 175.92000000000002
it is sunday the 12th of december 2021

173.76 --> 178.92
12 12

175.92 --> 178.92
2021

181.519 --> 186.4
two weeks

182.879 --> 188.319
straight bad what well

186.4 --> 191.28
i don't know the surface that maybe like

188.319 --> 191.28
where you are at

194.0 --> 198.64
but yeah yesterday here the weather

196.8 --> 201.20000000000002
like up until the

198.64 --> 202.95899999999997
night it was pretty nice it kept clear

201.2 --> 204.56
it's just like right yeah in the middle

202.959 --> 207.28
of the night it really started to become

204.56 --> 210.159
clouded and then

207.28 --> 213.12
turned raining

210.159 --> 216.48
but before that it was kind of nice and

213.12 --> 216.48000000000002
clear with sun

218.0 --> 222.4
right

219.519 --> 224.799
all right well yeah come on can't be

222.4 --> 226.87900000000002
helped don't worry

224.799 --> 229.04000000000002
although it is a bit of a nuisance for

226.879 --> 231.35999999999999
you i guess since

229.04 --> 236.07999999999998
yeah you

231.36 --> 236.08
move around outside of for your job so

238.08 --> 241.84
right

239.04 --> 241.84
anyway

245.84 --> 249.36
yeah yesterday was uh

250.0 --> 254.2
it's a very short show

257.28 --> 260.799
and yeah it was

259.6 --> 263.52000000000004
audibly

260.799 --> 266.32
shaky and all that

263.52 --> 269.68
and today that's that's definitely gone

266.32 --> 270.8
as i predicted and would

269.68 --> 273.04
like even

270.8 --> 274.72
in the evening i already felt completely

273.04 --> 275.759
restored

274.72 --> 277.759
or well

275.759 --> 281.28000000000003
yeah

277.759 --> 283.759
and i had a nice chicken broccoli dinner

281.28 --> 285.75899999999996
and that really hit the spot like it

283.759 --> 288.16
really really hit the spot i i could

285.759 --> 291.199
literally from that point on just feel

288.16 --> 291.199
it healing me

291.36 --> 296.40000000000003
so yeah they did a lot of good and i had

293.199 --> 297.759
a massively long sleep

296.4 --> 301.28
as well and that's

297.759 --> 301.28000000000003
part of the reason i was late

301.759 --> 306.47900000000004
because i i got up

304.4 --> 307.75899999999996
even though i'm alarm my alarm clock was

306.479 --> 309.84
on

307.759 --> 311.68
two and a half hours earlier i got up

309.84 --> 314.08
like half hour before i normally start

311.68 --> 314.08
the show

314.56 --> 319.52
but i'm feeling very rested and much

316.72 --> 322.16
much better than yesterday

319.52 --> 322.15999999999997
and also

322.24 --> 327.919
yeah the day was a bit for devoid

326.479 --> 330.0
of streams

327.919 --> 331.68
most of it

330.0 --> 334.08
which i don't really expect on a

331.68 --> 337.28000000000003
saturday

334.08 --> 340.0
there was no ball busters and

337.28 --> 341.84
but yeah i did sit into martin luther's

340.0 --> 344.4
stream he always does a flatter day

341.84 --> 344.4
night thing

344.88 --> 348.24
flatter day night ditch

348.4 --> 353.84
and uh yeah

351.28 --> 356.63899999999995
i did appreciate because

353.84 --> 358.31899999999996
yeah whatever you think of martin

356.639 --> 360.40000000000003
he's like a good

358.319 --> 362.08000000000004
spirits guy

360.4 --> 363.919
it's just fun to hang around with

362.08 --> 366.479
whether he what he's

363.919 --> 369.84
saying is cohesive or not he is always

366.479 --> 374.0
in good spirit and i kind of needed that

369.84 --> 374.0
so thank you martin for just being you

375.039 --> 379.24
no matter how silly that gets

380.16 --> 384.56
so i guess it was the chicken

382.319 --> 386.96000000000004
and martin combined that just completely

384.56 --> 389.28000000000003
healed me up

386.96 --> 393.63899999999995
hey rest ahead stop the traffic and

389.28 --> 393.63899999999995
arrest that good to see you and clutch

404.639 --> 409.40000000000003
yeah

406.0 --> 409.4
eb ditch

410.8 --> 413.52000000000004
right rasta

414.0 --> 416.4
anyway

417.919 --> 420.919
ah

425.039 --> 430.08
uh let's see what else was going on i

427.44 --> 432.16
might have missed a couple of things

430.08 --> 433.68
i don't think so it was just not really

432.16 --> 437.24
super

433.68 --> 437.24
loaded with streams

438.96 --> 441.919
so

440.4 --> 444.79999999999995
yeah

441.919 --> 447.35999999999996
michael khan just mirrored flatter

444.8 --> 449.36
school from the day before

447.36 --> 451.599
i mean it was a good stream

449.36 --> 453.28000000000003
but for me to just sit

451.599 --> 454.15999999999997
like watch it all over again i don't

453.28 --> 455.84
know

454.16 --> 457.59900000000005
it's a little short

455.84 --> 460.79999999999995
but yeah it's a good it was a good show

457.599 --> 460.8
to spread around so

461.28 --> 464.28
uh

466.319 --> 469.68
let's see

467.44 --> 469.68
yeah

474.479 --> 479.28
uh yeah yeah in my

476.879 --> 481.759
list that was it anyway hello jeff

479.28 --> 481.75899999999996
gassett

491.36 --> 495.199
all right

492.96 --> 497.28
i have to kind of find my bearings as

495.199 --> 498.72
usual when i start the show

497.28 --> 500.63899999999995
because yesterday

498.72 --> 504.08000000000004
yeah i just was way too sick to do

500.639 --> 506.8
anything but i did bring up subjects

504.08 --> 510.639
a couple of things that kind of

506.8 --> 512.9590000000001
just grabbed my attention at that time

510.639 --> 515.279
like this new shield group in the

512.959 --> 517.68
netherlands

515.279 --> 521.479
which i'm not entirely sure like even

517.68 --> 521.4789999999999
what it is just yet

522.719 --> 526.1600000000001
but

524.159 --> 527.68
because like with everything that's

526.16 --> 529.76
going down

527.68 --> 530.88
also in the netherlands

529.76 --> 533.04
like

530.88 --> 535.8389999999999
i feel like constant

533.04 --> 535.8389999999999
the risk of

536.48 --> 541.9200000000001
basically

537.68 --> 541.92
controlled operations

542.32 --> 545.9200000000001
right there's like a risk of controlled

544.48 --> 547.519
operations

545.92 --> 550.16
to basically

547.519 --> 554.24
catch certain people and maneuver their

550.16 --> 557.279
lives into certain group formations

554.24 --> 557.279
uh yeah and

559.6 --> 563.24
and then eventually

563.519 --> 568.24
when before they might start yeah they

566.24 --> 570.88
might start up being

568.24 --> 573.6800000000001
exactly what everybody needs right

570.88 --> 575.76
but yeah is it gonna stay that way or

573.68 --> 578.56
are they going to be kind of like

575.76 --> 580.88
politically maneuvered around

578.56 --> 583.1999999999999
i don't know yet i don't know the people

580.88 --> 583.2
in there

583.839 --> 587.6800000000001
but yeah they do seem to have like

586.399 --> 589.519
promotion

587.68 --> 592.0799999999999
videos and all that

589.519 --> 594.0
and it does

592.08 --> 597.2
kind of have the feel like there are

594.0 --> 598.32
people involved that do play the media

597.2 --> 599.12
game

598.32 --> 601.44
so

599.12 --> 604.5600000000001
one on the one hand it looks extremely

601.44 --> 606.48
promising it's like almost to me feels

604.56 --> 608.0
like a direct response like we need to

606.48 --> 610.88
get militant

608.0 --> 612.8
we can't just expect that we can protest

610.88 --> 616.16
and they just illegally stop us from

612.8 --> 618.079
doing that etc etc i had that kind of a

616.16 --> 619.36
attitude and a bit of a speech a while

618.079 --> 621.5999999999999
back what is it

619.36 --> 622.88
one or two weeks ago maybe more i don't

621.6 --> 624.399
know

622.88 --> 626.16
i've repeated it a couple of times and

624.399 --> 629.12
this kind of does feel like hey this

626.16 --> 631.36
group is kind of like that

629.12 --> 635.279
but is it gonna be good or is this like

631.36 --> 636.72
a like in the us a q operation or a

635.279 --> 638.0
right wing

636.72 --> 639.0400000000001
right

638.0 --> 641.279
wing

639.04 --> 643.36
right

641.279 --> 644.72
i think i think that might be a great

643.36 --> 648.0790000000001
title

644.72 --> 650.9590000000001
for for that political movement by now

648.079 --> 652.399
it's the right

650.959 --> 655.399
wing

652.399 --> 655.399
right

662.0 --> 666.079
so but yeah no guarantee that

665.2 --> 667.44
the

666.079 --> 668.399
shield

667.44 --> 669.9200000000001
group

668.399 --> 672.24
or the defend group here in the

669.92 --> 675.64
netherlands is is that

672.24 --> 675.64
is like that

676.32 --> 680.72
i don't know just yet so i'll try but

678.88 --> 684.24
i'm gonna keep how to

680.72 --> 684.24
keep an eye open

684.399 --> 688.64
and they have a department here in my

685.92 --> 689.92
city apparently but i have no idea who's

688.64 --> 692.56
in there

689.92 --> 695.12
but i do get like there are people

692.56 --> 697.1199999999999
around just having a life

695.12 --> 699.76
that kind of like me

697.12 --> 702.8
stare around a lot

699.76 --> 706.0
like trying to figure out people not

702.8 --> 708.56
being like oh my god are they goofy not

706.0 --> 710.72
idiots but like people that are trying

708.56 --> 712.88
to figure out are there some other awake

710.72 --> 716.9200000000001
people out there

712.88 --> 716.92
without just being overt

719.44 --> 724.24
right

721.519 --> 726.079
so maybe some of those are like info

724.24 --> 728.399
that may i don't know but this must have

726.079 --> 730.16
been kind of like building up for a

728.399 --> 732.16
while

730.16 --> 734.16
to have this many members and they all

732.16 --> 737.68
have their own local

734.16 --> 740.24
flag symbol per city

737.68 --> 743.7199999999999
so it all it's also like that has a bit

740.24 --> 743.72
of like a

744.639 --> 752.0
football club type of feel to it there

747.76 --> 754.959
might be some like football fans

752.0 --> 757.2
that well they don't want to get a v

754.959 --> 759.279
you know what to go to game so yeah

757.2 --> 761.519
that's a good reason

759.279 --> 763.8389999999999
right that's that alone for a whole

761.519 --> 767.04
bunch of like football supporters

763.839 --> 768.639
that do that have this group thing going

767.04 --> 770.56
good reason

768.639 --> 773.12
to get like this because yeah they're

770.56 --> 775.4399999999999
just not allowed to games

773.12 --> 778.16
because they didn't take the v

775.44 --> 779.36
you know that's gonna piss them off

778.16 --> 783.36
right

779.36 --> 786.36
anyway that's that's the group

783.36 --> 786.36
defend

788.639 --> 793.12
let's see

790.72 --> 796.0
and it was very late to catch on that

793.12 --> 798.639
that was even a thing

796.0 --> 801.44
apparently like a week ago or something

798.639 --> 804.5600000000001
a couple of days ago

801.44 --> 804.5600000000001
there was that article

805.92 --> 809.04
and i didn't notice it

810.48 --> 815.32
let me try to find it where is it

828.079 --> 830.399
right

833.68 --> 838.079
anyway i posted the link in my skype

840.16 --> 843.8389999999999
early bird chat

844.079 --> 850.56
or nobody ever speaks up but that's fine

846.32 --> 850.5600000000001
i'm just using it as a link database

851.279 --> 857.279
but they have this video it's in dutch

854.639 --> 859.839
or with dutch text it's not

857.279 --> 862.16
it's all super simple text

859.839 --> 862.1600000000001
right

864.56 --> 867.92
it's not a

865.76 --> 872.88
high intellectual piece it's just like

867.92 --> 872.88
yeah this is us and we don't take [ __ ]

875.279 --> 880.959
all right

876.959 --> 880.959
so that yeah just take a look and

881.44 --> 887.12
and consider i wonder is there anything

883.519 --> 888.9590000000001
like this even in other places

887.12 --> 891.44
because they seem to be very much a

888.959 --> 893.3599999999999
dutch group like all the

891.44 --> 895.9200000000001
departments are like cities of the

893.36 --> 895.92
netherlands

896.839 --> 901.519
anyway

898.48 --> 901.519

917.44 --> 924.24

921.199 --> 927.12
they are putting loudspeakers

924.24 --> 929.759
what

927.12 --> 932.5600000000001
like the proud boys yeah yeah yeah yeah

929.759 --> 934.48
they do have a bit of that feel to it

932.56 --> 938.3599999999999
yeah

934.48 --> 938.36
i agree rest dad

941.759 --> 946.5600000000001
except yeah these proud boys are ain't

944.56 --> 949.1199999999999
wielding no guns if you know what i mean

946.56 --> 951.3599999999999
because that's unfortunately yeah that

949.12 --> 955.0
works in the united states

951.36 --> 955.0
doesn't work here

975.68 --> 978.68
hmm

988.399 --> 991.12
oh man

992.0 --> 995.12
they don't carry

993.6 --> 997.279
the proud boys

995.12 --> 999.519
oh

997.279 --> 1002.399
oh right that was like another part

999.519 --> 1004.079
right that was like the the boogaloos

1002.399 --> 1006.24
that did that

1004.079 --> 1008.56
okay

1006.24 --> 1009.279
right well then maybe it is kind of like

1008.56 --> 1011.3599999999999
a

1009.279 --> 1014.8
a proud voice and it could be that they

1011.36 --> 1016.8000000000001
have like ties to that whole stuff

1014.8 --> 1017.8389999999999
to that type of political movement as

1016.8 --> 1019.92
well

1017.839 --> 1021.2790000000001
wouldn't surprise me because yeah a lot

1019.92 --> 1022.8389999999999
of

1021.279 --> 1028.4
the

1022.839 --> 1028.4
paradigm that is reinforced by media

1029.36 --> 1033.6
left right paradigm media does

1031.6 --> 1035.9189999999999
absolutely shine through to the

1033.6 --> 1038.319
netherlands right

1035.919 --> 1040.959
like four decades the netherlands has

1038.319 --> 1040.959
been like a

1041.439 --> 1046.0790000000002
like a sub-american

1043.839 --> 1048.0
department almost and that's been like

1046.079 --> 1050.72
for decades it's been all my life that

1048.0 --> 1052.559
the netherlands was kind of like always

1050.72 --> 1054.799
keeping an eye out on what happens in

1052.559 --> 1058.32
america and then you have like the dutch

1054.799 --> 1060.16
leftists that literally at the

1058.32 --> 1064.24
literally in the netherlands on the

1060.16 --> 1067.039
television worshipped obama was

1064.24 --> 1069.6
was absolutely repulsive they literally

1067.039 --> 1071.76
presented him like he was a an actual

1069.6 --> 1072.799
saint it was insane

1071.76 --> 1074.1299999999999
right

1072.799 --> 1075.2
but a lot of right-wing

1074.13 --> 1077.7600000000002
[Music]

1075.2 --> 1080.559
media

1077.76 --> 1082.559
things like alex jones also have been

1080.559 --> 1085.039
shining through here for a long time

1082.559 --> 1088.3999999999999
yeah well i've been following alex jones

1085.039 --> 1090.72
for a long time i am not the only one

1088.4 --> 1093.2
and there are others that fall for all

1090.72 --> 1095.84
the pitfalls they fall for his narrative

1093.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
and [ __ ]

1098.4 --> 1100.799
so

1099.52 --> 1104.4
i'm not

1100.799 --> 1106.84
i'm just like keeping a close tab

1104.4 --> 1111.76
trying to figure it out and

1106.84 --> 1114.48
yeah check out the documents he digs up

1111.76 --> 1117.52
but since there is like

1114.48 --> 1117.52
alex jones

1118.4 --> 1122.3200000000002
media shining through in the netherlands

1120.4 --> 1125.44
there are people that are kind of like

1122.32 --> 1127.52
that too so if it is like literally a

1125.44 --> 1130.559
proud boys type of movement that

1127.52 --> 1130.559
wouldn't surprise me

1133.6 --> 1138.3999999999999
hey

1134.84 --> 1141.6789999999999

i am allowing him to do that right i'm

1206.48 --> 1209.76
okay with him

1208.64 --> 1212.24
trying to

1209.76 --> 1214.0
get a bit of attention

1212.24 --> 1215.1200000000001
because he freaking lost an entire

1214.0 --> 1216.559
channel

1215.12 --> 1219.9599999999998
okay

1216.559 --> 1219.96

1223.36 --> 1227.76
i'm okay with that

1225.44 --> 1230.159
and i'm not gonna like make him look

1227.76 --> 1232.32
better than he is

1230.159 --> 1233.7600000000002
but i yeah i'm not just gonna like

1232.32 --> 1235.6
you're

1233.76 --> 1238.4
you're a stupid baller i don't allow you

1235.6 --> 1241.36
to advertise here no no no

1238.4 --> 1241.3600000000001
that's that's fine

1242.559 --> 1249.24
you know he's been

1244.32 --> 1249.24
graceful towards me as well

1249.84 --> 1254.9189999999999
it would only be civil to reciprocate

1264.88 --> 1268.679
yeah sleeping warrior

1293.6 --> 1297.24
what else was there

1307.039 --> 1310.48
oh

1308.559 --> 1312.72
yeah

1310.48 --> 1312.72
man

1314.0 --> 1317.0
i

1318.799 --> 1323.2
yeah i've heard some

1320.72 --> 1327.1200000000001
pretty freaky well rumors even though

1323.2 --> 1329.2
they're backed by actual text

1327.12 --> 1331.36
from uh

1329.2 --> 1334.72
from flat side

1331.36 --> 1336.6399999999999
apparently he's been zoning in on

1334.72 --> 1339.679
uh mr sensible

1336.64 --> 1342.24
like well the other people too because

1339.679 --> 1344.48
this is sensible is going at it with

1342.24 --> 1347.1200000000001
this stupid [ __ ]

1344.48 --> 1350.72
apparently uh mr sensible is new doing

1347.12 --> 1352.7199999999998
not so great right now

1350.72 --> 1355.28
health-wise

1352.72 --> 1356.96
because apparently i didn't even know

1355.28 --> 1358.3999999999999
that

1356.96 --> 1359.28
right i i just

1358.4 --> 1363.6000000000001
yeah

1359.28 --> 1366.0
apparently he is like a real pro vaxxer

1363.6 --> 1366.0
and

1366.24 --> 1370.88
he reported through text flat so i

1368.799 --> 1373.84
picked up on that that

1370.88 --> 1377.44
a couple of days ago

1373.84 --> 1380.559
texted out that he was

1377.44 --> 1383.3600000000001
well blatantly having side effects from

1380.559 --> 1386.8799999999999
the latest booster shot he took

1383.36 --> 1389.039
to the point where he had really really

1386.88 --> 1391.2
severe hallucinations

1389.039 --> 1394.72
he described it he had like an hour

1391.2 --> 1394.72
phone call with a cat

1396.0 --> 1401.2
right that's severe level that's not

1399.039 --> 1403.6
just oh i'm seeing weird side of no

1401.2 --> 1405.3600000000001
that's like really full inbound

1403.6 --> 1407.4399999999998
hallucination

1405.36 --> 1411.28
bad news

1407.44 --> 1414.0800000000002
bad news right this is what you get

1411.28 --> 1415.52
but yeah that makes me say

1414.08 --> 1417.6
well

1415.52 --> 1420.32
you know

1417.6 --> 1422.7199999999998
treasure these anti-flat earth idiots

1420.32 --> 1424.6399999999999
while you can because

1422.72 --> 1427.2
the way it's looking he might not be

1424.64 --> 1431.44
around for too much longer

1427.2 --> 1433.279
so enjoy the hilarious idiocy times

1431.44 --> 1435.039
because yeah that might just suddenly

1433.279 --> 1436.799
stop

1435.039 --> 1438.8799999999999
oh that's what i'm saying

1436.799 --> 1441.84
yeah exactly again might get a stroke or

1438.88 --> 1444.96
so he may have had a stroke

1441.84 --> 1447.9189999999999
right severe hallucinations

1444.96 --> 1449.3600000000001
that's that's like

1447.919 --> 1452.0
yeah

1449.36 --> 1454.7199999999998
that it could have been

1452.0 --> 1457.039
like a micro stroke or something right

1454.72 --> 1460.4
it you typically do get heavy

1457.039 --> 1463.36
hallucinations when that happens

1460.4 --> 1467.1200000000001
if not straight out just like click

1463.36 --> 1467.12
parts of your functioning go off

1468.32 --> 1473.1589999999999
so yeah

1469.84 --> 1473.1589999999999
pretty freaky

1473.6 --> 1478.48
so yeah mr sensible you you might want

1476.24 --> 1479.6
to stop doubling down

1478.48 --> 1481.679
because

1479.6 --> 1484.1589999999999
if you keep this up

1481.679 --> 1486.64
and you're going to be all like

1484.159 --> 1487.3600000000001
so funny oh i know what i'm doing yeah

1486.64 --> 1489.6000000000001
but

1487.36 --> 1492.1589999999999
you literally might die if you if you

1489.6 --> 1493.4399999999998
keep doubling down on this [ __ ]

1492.159 --> 1495.6000000000001
right

1493.44 --> 1498.559
i mean doubling down on the ball is one

1495.6 --> 1498.559
thing but this

1499.6 --> 1501.84
no

1506.24 --> 1508.64
anyway

1508.72 --> 1516.559
and maybe the next we'll fix it yeah

1512.4 --> 1516.5590000000002
well that seems the way he thinks

1517.2 --> 1521.0800000000002
and it's not good

1529.039 --> 1531.36
right

1531.84 --> 1536.08
has hallucinations as a side effect

1536.72 --> 1540.64
well it's it's not just hallucinations

1539.279 --> 1542.72
right

1540.64 --> 1545.3600000000001
it's if you're gonna have like an

1542.72 --> 1547.84
hour-long conversation with a cat over

1545.36 --> 1547.84
the phone

1548.4 --> 1554.3200000000002
like how you are bound even by doing

1551.679 --> 1556.96
that that's a severe hallucination

1554.32 --> 1558.72
that's not just visual weird [ __ ] no

1556.96 --> 1560.159
that's like

1558.72 --> 1562.48
your mind

1560.159 --> 1564.3200000000002
is like psychotic because you think that

1562.48 --> 1567.52
that's a possibility you think that's

1564.32 --> 1569.76
normal that's severe

1567.52 --> 1573.72
that's that can be a sign that you had a

1569.76 --> 1573.72
stroke or something so

1585.279 --> 1590.96
hey adam akin yeah yeah now he's a dude

1588.24 --> 1590.96
he's in trouble

1592.159 --> 1597.1200000000001
which jimmy john the latest

1594.559 --> 1601.2
i think he's taken like all of it

1597.12 --> 1601.1999999999998
but he was talking about booster so

1604.96 --> 1608.159
a seeking star wars

1611.6 --> 1614.8799999999999
dare it 306.

1617.76 --> 1620.64
cocktail

1639.679 --> 1644.64
want to thank you a lot for that link

1642.08 --> 1647.4399999999998
you dug up yesterday

1644.64 --> 1651.5200000000002
so the rudolf steiner pdfs

1647.44 --> 1653.52
like that worked i've been reading up

1651.52 --> 1656.1589999999999
like that's a really an amazing little

1653.52 --> 1659.36
archive you found there

1656.159 --> 1660.48
and i've been reading and having my mind

1659.36 --> 1663.039
like

1660.48 --> 1667.3600000000001
totally blown away

1663.039 --> 1670.1589999999999
like totally because because because

1667.36 --> 1671.6789999999999
i'm reading some of this stuff

1670.159 --> 1674.0
and i'm like

1671.679 --> 1676.48
what the [ __ ]

1674.0 --> 1679.84
what the [ __ ]

1676.48 --> 1683.2
that's what i say

1679.84 --> 1685.279
i've never read that but it's what i say

1683.2 --> 1686.64
it's how i figured it out

1685.279 --> 1688.96
i mean

1686.64 --> 1692.0
everything that i do even like when i

1688.96 --> 1695.679
use the words arimon and lucifer like

1692.0 --> 1698.48
spirit cosmology right i've been taught

1695.679 --> 1701.52
that sort of because my healer like he

1698.48 --> 1703.919
taught me that in a verbal teaching

1701.52 --> 1706.0
but i've never really read any

1703.919 --> 1708.159
rudolf steiner books

1706.0 --> 1709.679
and yeah the subject

1708.159 --> 1710.64
from what i was reading wasn't about

1709.679 --> 1711.8400000000001
that

1710.64 --> 1715.6000000000001
but

1711.84 --> 1718.72
he was just using the exoteric and

1715.6 --> 1720.9599999999998
esoteric paradigm

1718.72 --> 1724.799
like exactly

1720.96 --> 1726.24
the way that i do and i'm like what

1724.799 --> 1728.8799999999999
what

1726.24 --> 1730.08
that's crazy

1728.88 --> 1732.0800000000002
like

1730.08 --> 1733.4399999999998
i'm talking

1732.08 --> 1736.48
about it

1733.44 --> 1740.72
the way i figured it out and it's

1736.48 --> 1743.84
a match to something this guy

1740.72 --> 1745.6000000000001
a century ago was saying like even the

1743.84 --> 1748.279
way he's saying it

1745.6 --> 1751.279
and it's just like dude talk about a

1748.279 --> 1754.24
synchronicity man

1751.279 --> 1754.24
that's incredible

1760.159 --> 1764.64
and that's just one of those things the

1762.159 --> 1768.0
exoterics versus the esoterics but yeah

1764.64 --> 1771.1200000000001
man rude of steiner is talking about

1768.0 --> 1771.12
spirit mechanics

1771.36 --> 1774.24
and

1772.159 --> 1777.0390000000002
the thing that i that i'm that's that is

1774.24 --> 1780.84
really standing out the most

1777.039 --> 1780.84
is that he is

1782.08 --> 1786.32
different

1783.44 --> 1788.0800000000002
than me in a certain way in a very

1786.32 --> 1791.279
specific way

1788.08 --> 1794.32
because fruit of steiner seems to always

1791.279 --> 1797.12
point out the situation

1794.32 --> 1800.32
an energy situation it was very elusive

1797.12 --> 1801.1999999999998
and then immediately give you something

1800.32 --> 1803.76
to

1801.2 --> 1805.6000000000001
kind of like a like a little trick and

1803.76 --> 1808.48
it's a good trick every time this is

1805.6 --> 1811.6789999999999
good at figuring out those tricks figure

1808.48 --> 1814.64
out a way to respond in order to

1811.679 --> 1817.2
anchor the realization of that moment

1814.64 --> 1819.8400000000001
into a response

1817.2 --> 1822.88
that's like really smart

1819.84 --> 1825.12
and very consistent it's funny because

1822.88 --> 1827.8400000000001
you know in his own way

1825.12 --> 1830.08
jesus kind of does that

1827.84 --> 1832.48
right but rudolf steiner also does that

1830.08 --> 1834.6399999999999
very persistently and it works

1832.48 --> 1836.64
it's very comprehensible

1834.64 --> 1841.039
i do things differently

1836.64 --> 1843.6000000000001
i am like really purely descriptive

1841.039 --> 1845.6
i'm all about

1843.6 --> 1848.799
staring at it

1845.6 --> 1850.399
and then visualizing

1848.799 --> 1852.6399999999999
the dynamic

1850.399 --> 1855.36
of it as a raw

1852.64 --> 1859.519
energy strand

1855.36 --> 1861.9189999999999
virtually represented in my mind

1859.519 --> 1864.48
that's what i do it's different

1861.919 --> 1866.7990000000002
i'm i'm not really even too much

1864.48 --> 1869.519
concerned about like

1866.799 --> 1871.679
an interventionist attitude it's more

1869.519 --> 1873.919
about how do you see how do you

1871.679 --> 1875.2
fine-tune that's what i'm like really

1873.919 --> 1877.8400000000001
focused on

1875.2 --> 1879.3600000000001
and what i do i hope it works guys i

1877.84 --> 1881.6789999999999
really do

1879.36 --> 1884.1589999999999
because sometimes

1881.679 --> 1886.48
i watch myself back when i'm for example

1884.159 --> 1888.5590000000002
really intense like a

1886.48 --> 1893.84
thursday show i watched thursday's show

1888.559 --> 1893.84
back thursday show was freaking epic

1895.2 --> 1900.799
i was like really

1897.76 --> 1900.799
really on point

1903.039 --> 1908.72
have you guys watched it back

1904.88 --> 1912.72
thursday show it was really good

1908.72 --> 1915.44
now wait not thursday's friday show

1912.72 --> 1916.96
what am i talking about

1915.44 --> 1919.039
the day before

1916.96 --> 1921.279
i got sick

1919.039 --> 1924.64
this was quite a contrast friday show

1921.279 --> 1924.64
just to yesterday's show

1925.519 --> 1928.48
but i'm always

1928.88 --> 1934.24
describing it like a visualization of

1931.919 --> 1937.919
like how to see how to visually

1934.24 --> 1943.279
represent in your virtual mind

1937.919 --> 1943.279
these elusive spirit and energy things

1943.36 --> 1947.6
that's my doing

1945.039 --> 1950.08
so rudolph really focuses on like

1947.6 --> 1951.9189999999999
recognizing and then finding the right

1950.08 --> 1954.0
way to change it

1951.919 --> 1954.7990000000002
kind of like jesus did

1954.0 --> 1956.159
i

1954.799 --> 1959.279
am just like

1956.159 --> 1962.0800000000002
this is how you can really just

1959.279 --> 1963.6
see it and then kind of use that

1962.08 --> 1966.96
knowledge to

1963.6 --> 1968.1589999999999
figure out how things will go

1966.96 --> 1970.159
so not

1968.159 --> 1972.0800000000002
really like this is how you then change

1970.159 --> 1974.24
it around

1972.08 --> 1977.6789999999999
i guess

1974.24 --> 1979.36
i'm a bit more neutral in my own right

1977.679 --> 1982.88
i don't know if anybody by the way can

1979.36 --> 1984.7199999999998
follow what i'm talking about right now

1982.88 --> 1989.0800000000002
but i am

1984.72 --> 1989.08
it would be good to have some feedback

1994.48 --> 1998.64
you were rosicrucian now

1997.039 --> 2003.519
well i might be

1998.64 --> 2003.519
i certainly have known rosicrucians

2003.76 --> 2008.799
i've met one

2005.76 --> 2008.799
15 years ago

2009.44 --> 2014.24
i even

2010.399 --> 2016.2399999999998
went to her place at the time

2014.24 --> 2017.76
i kind of try to get a relationship with

2016.24 --> 2018.559
her but

2017.76 --> 2021.519
she

2018.559 --> 2021.519
she was taken

2026.799 --> 2030.559
and i i don't know if she was interested

2031.12 --> 2035.36
but yeah

2032.399 --> 2037.279
the the whole rosha rosa crucian thing

2035.36 --> 2038.8799999999999
and the jesuits

2037.279 --> 2041.919
in

2038.88 --> 2042.64
linear opposition to that was a really

2041.919 --> 2045.6000000000001
fascinating

2042.64 --> 2047.519
[Music]

2045.6 --> 2050.0
study peace

2047.519 --> 2052.879
in that one document uh

2050.0 --> 2052.879
which one was it

2054.96 --> 2058.639
from jesus to christ

2059.119 --> 2063.52
that's the one i think i shared with you

2061.119 --> 2065.28
adam

2063.52 --> 2067.2
the other one was also really

2065.28 --> 2069.0400000000004
fascinating but i didn't get to for

2067.2 --> 2070.56
because these freaking documents are

2069.04 --> 2072.879
huge

2070.56 --> 2075.52
and i'm like after like seven pages i'm

2072.879 --> 2078.72
like it's like i read an entire book i

2075.52 --> 2078.72
don't have any more room

2080.399 --> 2084.3199999999997
but yeah the other one was called

2082.079 --> 2086.5600000000004
dimensions of space

2084.32 --> 2089.28
because i think that rudolph steiner has

2086.56 --> 2092.0789999999997
also basically attempted

2089.28 --> 2096.3990000000003
to really map out spirit cosmology and

2092.079 --> 2100.5600000000004
maybe even a bit of real world cosmology

2096.399 --> 2100.56
so i'm kind of very curious to find out

2101.2 --> 2105.2799999999997
those types of things because most of

2103.2 --> 2108.72
the time he's just talking about spirits

2105.28 --> 2109.76
and spirit interaction and

2108.72 --> 2113.52
yeah

2109.76 --> 2114.7200000000003
very curious to find out more about his

2113.52 --> 2117.2
view

2114.72 --> 2120.72
on the physical world

2117.2 --> 2120.72
and the dimensions of it

2124.24 --> 2126.8799999999997
oh yeah

2127.52 --> 2131.839
globals are sextant offenders yeah that

2129.52 --> 2131.839
was brilliant

2144.4 --> 2147.4
anyway

2161.359 --> 2165.5989999999997
define spirit and spirituality

2166.96 --> 2172.0
well

2168.8 --> 2173.44
when riddle started literally does that

2172.0 --> 2175.04
literally

2173.44 --> 2178.2400000000002
in the document

2175.04 --> 2179.92
i think it both it does it

2178.24 --> 2182.7999999999997
and

2179.92 --> 2186.0
yeah the thing about it like in

2182.8 --> 2188.2400000000002
space of dimensions he really highlights

2186.0 --> 2190.4
like a sort of almost physics approach

2188.24 --> 2193.839
he talks a lot about exoterics vs

2190.4 --> 2193.839
esoterics in that one

2194.079 --> 2198.2400000000002
about

2196.0 --> 2201.2
like where does the physical action come

2198.24 --> 2202.8799999999997
from comes from the spirit but

2201.2 --> 2205.4399999999996
spirit

2202.88 --> 2208.48
isn't like it's non-local

2205.44 --> 2211.119
it's not actually part of this world

2208.48 --> 2213.2
but it is

2211.119 --> 2215.6800000000003
through you

2213.2 --> 2217.68
there is some kind of bizarre connection

2215.68 --> 2220.8799999999997
through the

2217.68 --> 2224.0
the spatially dimensionless

2220.88 --> 2227.96
and the spatial dimension which is like

2224.0 --> 2227.96
the physical world

2228.24 --> 2234.3999999999996
so

2229.599 --> 2236.7200000000003
define spirit and spirituality yeah that

2234.4 --> 2239.119
you have to recognize it and you have to

2236.72 --> 2242.7599999999998
recognize that it's different from the

2239.119 --> 2242.76
typically physical

2246.96 --> 2253.599
and spirituality simply means everything

2250.0 --> 2253.599
that concerns the spirit

2254.64 --> 2257.44
right

2255.76 --> 2260.48
but yeah

2257.44 --> 2264.16
simply defining spirit and spirituality

2260.48 --> 2267.28
that's like a really big chore

2264.16 --> 2268.96
you don't just quickly define it

2267.28 --> 2271.6800000000003
because of its

2268.96 --> 2274.64
elusive nature

2271.68 --> 2277.44
because some people might simply not be

2274.64 --> 2278.3199999999997
able to pick up on it they their senses

2277.44 --> 2279.359
are

2278.32 --> 2281.92
cut off

2279.359 --> 2283.52
in their region so they literally can't

2281.92 --> 2285.2000000000003
believe it

2283.52 --> 2287.28
they might want to believe it but there

2285.2 --> 2290.56
is nothing for them

2287.28 --> 2294.0
sensory wise to pick up about it so it

2290.56 --> 2296.24
remains completely elusive to so to them

2294.0 --> 2298.88
it will seem

2296.24 --> 2301.2799999999997
like it's just a [ __ ] story

2298.88 --> 2301.28
you see

2301.52 --> 2307.2
like all of it becomes a [ __ ] story

2303.68 --> 2309.7599999999998
because they have no senses to pick up

2307.2 --> 2312.7599999999998
what about it is actually real and what

2309.76 --> 2312.76
isn't

2323.2 --> 2328.64
only seen film

2326.4 --> 2328.64
right

2331.76 --> 2338.6800000000003
when p what people do by saying i'm

2334.72 --> 2338.68
spirit yeah it is ridiculous

2340.079 --> 2345.48
but but it's like a

2341.92 --> 2345.48
gross colloquialization

2352.72 --> 2357.68
it's kind of the same issue [ __ ]

2355.44 --> 2360.32
that we have to deal with when people

2357.68 --> 2362.3999999999996
say but i'm into science

2360.32 --> 2366.96
i'm into science yeah it has nothing to

2362.4 --> 2366.96
do with science you just think it is

2367.28 --> 2371.0
because of the colloquialism

2373.92 --> 2378.0
and it makes it look really stupid when

2375.92 --> 2380.96
you know that and the same goes for

2378.0 --> 2381.76
people that say i'm spiritual

2380.96 --> 2384.64
right

2381.76 --> 2386.8
you shouldn't have to say it

2384.64 --> 2389.44
it should be evident

2386.8 --> 2392.079
because even saying it to those who it

2389.44 --> 2395.28
isn't evident is completely pointless

2392.079 --> 2396.96
because to them it won't mean anything

2395.28 --> 2399.2000000000003
when you have the sensory for it you

2396.96 --> 2401.2
will pick up when somebody is spiritual

2399.2 --> 2403.2
and how much

2401.2 --> 2405.2
if you don't because you don't have the

2403.2 --> 2408.3999999999996
sensory for it

2405.2 --> 2411.839
then saying it means absolutely nothing

2408.4 --> 2411.839
to such a person

2412.319 --> 2417.44
it'll mean like the equivalent

2414.079 --> 2419.44
potentially of i'm delusional because

2417.44 --> 2422.839
yeah it doesn't mean anything to people

2419.44 --> 2424.64
that don't have the senses for it

2422.839 --> 2428.319
right

2424.64 --> 2429.16
like i don't have to say i'm spiritual

2428.319 --> 2431.2
it's

2429.16 --> 2435.3999999999996
self-evidence for those who have the

2431.2 --> 2435.3999999999996
senses to pick up on it

2447.92 --> 2452.2000000000003
basis empty fake self-fulfillment

2452.88 --> 2458.079
well yeah that's to those that don't

2454.96 --> 2459.76
have the senses to pick up on it

2458.079 --> 2461.599
that's exactly what it seems so it

2459.76 --> 2463.28
becomes self-defeating right if you

2461.599 --> 2464.56
don't have the senses to pick up on it

2463.28 --> 2466.88
then why

2464.56 --> 2468.64
would somebody remind you about that

2466.88 --> 2471.359
because it doesn't mean anything so it

2468.64 --> 2471.359
is kind of like

2471.599 --> 2476.2400000000002
self-defeating

2474.079 --> 2478.4
it's not even fake self-fulfillment it's

2476.24 --> 2481.839
self-defeating

2478.4 --> 2481.839
to say it

2485.28 --> 2488.5600000000004
right

2486.16 --> 2490.7999999999997
well many people say i'm spiritual but

2488.56 --> 2492.24
can't define it well that's because they

2490.8 --> 2494.4
they're not

2492.24 --> 2496.7999999999997
meaning that

2494.4 --> 2498.2400000000002
what they usually mean

2496.8 --> 2500.96
is hey

2498.24 --> 2503.5989999999997
i'm in good spirits when i'm in good

2500.96 --> 2507.52
spirits i have energy and then

2503.599 --> 2509.44
because of that energy i can pick up on

2507.52 --> 2512.88
the elusive

2509.44 --> 2514.64
spiritual nature of things

2512.88 --> 2516.88
that's usually what that means because

2514.64 --> 2518.72
that's how it works when you feel strong

2516.88 --> 2520.96
and you have the sensories you will

2518.72 --> 2522.56
start to be able to use it

2520.96 --> 2525.119
if you're not strong you don't have the

2522.56 --> 2528.92
energy you might know it exists but it

2525.119 --> 2528.92
becomes out of reach

2544.96 --> 2551.16
hello mark shirley by the way oh sherry

2548.079 --> 2551.1600000000003
i mean

2567.76 --> 2570.76
so

2580.4 --> 2585.0
oh they say i'm not religious but i'm

2582.8 --> 2588.079
spiritual right well that's just more

2585.0 --> 2589.52
colloquialism it's all colloquial like

2588.079 --> 2592.2400000000002
these people

2589.52 --> 2594.64
literally don't know the language they

2592.24 --> 2597.7599999999998
use they don't understand how to use

2594.64 --> 2600.319
words properly they're fully

2597.76 --> 2605.88
immersed in colloquialism

2600.319 --> 2605.88
blabbermouth syndrome you could call it

2613.04 --> 2616.64
right because when they say i'm not

2614.8 --> 2619.04
religious they mean

2616.64 --> 2624.56
i don't believe

2619.04 --> 2625.7599999999998
in a rigid super exoterrorized bible god

2624.56 --> 2627.7599999999998
chant

2625.76 --> 2629.599
that's what they mean

2627.76 --> 2631.92
that's it

2629.599 --> 2634.56
that's what they mean when they say that

2631.92 --> 2635.52
in that context if they're also gonna

2634.56 --> 2637.52
say

2635.52 --> 2639.7599999999998
but i'm spiritual

2637.52 --> 2641.7599999999998
it's pure colloquial

2639.76 --> 2644.079
dumbassery

2641.76 --> 2648.8390000000004
just they don't know how to properly use

2644.079 --> 2648.8390000000004
the words they don't know the roots

2652.88 --> 2657.76
right and yeah some some of them are

2655.2 --> 2659.4399999999996
like yeah i don't believe in a god but i

2657.76 --> 2661.44
believe in everything else and then they

2659.44 --> 2663.28
also say that like yeah i'm spiritual

2661.44 --> 2665.359
but i'm not religious

2663.28 --> 2668.3190000000004
because they think

2665.359 --> 2671.92
by like wiki imprinting

2668.319 --> 2677.359
religion means following a deity which

2671.92 --> 2680.64
is absolutely [ __ ] as a definition

2677.359 --> 2683.5989999999997
it's totally insane

2680.64 --> 2688.359
that that is kind of the way

2683.599 --> 2688.3590000000004
it's maybe made to see

2692.4 --> 2696.4
what are your thoughts on metaphysics

2696.96 --> 2701.44
but that all depends on what you're

2698.72 --> 2704.56
talking about

2701.44 --> 2707.599
i mean metaphysics is kind of like

2704.56 --> 2707.599
spirit mechanics

2711.76 --> 2715.6800000000003
it's

2713.2 --> 2719.839
the structure of that

2715.68 --> 2719.839
which is evident but elusive

2720.88 --> 2725.76
like

2721.92 --> 2725.76
symbolic descriptions

2726.56 --> 2730.72
that like you

2728.079 --> 2733.6800000000003
are made to quickly understand even

2730.72 --> 2736.72
though none of it is literal

2733.68 --> 2736.72
that's metaphysics

2740.4 --> 2746.7200000000003
speaking in the archetypal symbols

2743.68 --> 2749.839
that are just that work very easy

2746.72 --> 2751.5989999999997
they're easy to absorb for people

2749.839 --> 2755.92
because it is kind of like the sub

2751.599 --> 2755.92
language it's the language of symbols

2759.839 --> 2763.72
that's how i see metaphysics

2790.0 --> 2795.44
you work with the deity

2792.4 --> 2797.92
yeah rastad well then according to the

2795.44 --> 2802.52
colloquial understanding of the word

2797.92 --> 2802.52
religion you are religious

2802.56 --> 2806.88
you gotta live with it you are religious

2804.88 --> 2810.28
rasta hat

2806.88 --> 2810.28
you're religious

2830.8 --> 2833.119
sure

2834.319 --> 2838.52
don't deny that all right

2856.319 --> 2863.04
would you consider spirit a duality or

2860.079 --> 2863.04
singular what

2865.359 --> 2870.359
that depends on what you mean with the

2867.359 --> 2870.359
spirit

2872.0 --> 2878.0
i mean what is that

2873.92 --> 2880.16
i mean you did if you'd say the spirit

2878.0 --> 2881.52
then you're talking about like the

2880.16 --> 2884.72
specific

2881.52 --> 2887.04
energy part of a person

2884.72 --> 2888.3999999999996
but spirit

2887.04 --> 2892.16
dude that

2888.4 --> 2892.1600000000003
that's a whole bunch of things so

2894.0 --> 2900.64
and i don't see how there is like an

2896.88 --> 2903.359
automated duality or singularity to it

2900.64 --> 2907.92
i don't think there is any

2903.359 --> 2907.92
any of that except those that are

2910.16 --> 2915.839
imposed onto it

2912.48 --> 2915.839
by conscious decision

2916.16 --> 2922.5589999999997
right i think you can impose a duality

2919.359 --> 2924.5589999999997
or singularity on your spirit

2922.559 --> 2928.28
but that's something that you do it's

2924.559 --> 2928.28
not it's nature

2928.559 --> 2933.28
because spirit is not the mind

2933.839 --> 2938.24
it doesn't have to structurize things

2938.88 --> 2943.0
it's free like the wind

2944.16 --> 2948.0789999999997
oh

2945.359 --> 2950.5589999999997
oh my god by the way again the rudolph

2948.079 --> 2951.52
steiner pdfs

2950.559 --> 2953.3590000000004
dude

2951.52 --> 2954.839
like he's

2953.359 --> 2959.359
literally

2954.839 --> 2959.359
describing my four elements

2960.24 --> 2963.24
like

2961.2 --> 2965.839
using the same metaphors it's

2963.24 --> 2967.52
unbelievable i couldn't believe i read

2965.839 --> 2970.0789999999997
that

2967.52 --> 2971.599
because i wrote stuff about that like in

2970.079 --> 2976.6400000000003
2006

2971.599 --> 2976.6400000000003
2008 on my symbolics website

2977.04 --> 2980.48
it's

2977.839 --> 2980.48
and it's just

2980.72 --> 2986.8799999999997
the guy is using the same metaphors 80

2983.839 --> 2989.2
years ago it's just like what

2986.88 --> 2989.2000000000003
what

2996.48 --> 3004.64
like literally using water for the soul

3002.319 --> 3007.839
air for the spirit

3004.64 --> 3010.16
fire for the consciousness

3007.839 --> 3011.119
body for the earth it just

3010.16 --> 3014.5589999999997
it just

3011.119 --> 3017.92
he uses it just like that

3014.559 --> 3021.1600000000003
and i never even knew that

3017.92 --> 3021.16
it's unbelievable

3032.64 --> 3040.04
yeah well stop alright look rest ahead

3035.04 --> 3040.04
i'm not really interested in like

3041.359 --> 3046.5589999999997
wicca related chanting practices and all

3043.839 --> 3048.4
that i don't like the con like there's a

3046.559 --> 3050.4
lot of conjuring

3048.4 --> 3052.96
going on

3050.4 --> 3054.559
in those traditions and that is not a

3052.96 --> 3055.92
good thing

3054.559 --> 3058.48
it isn't

3055.92 --> 3060.64
and if you don't know about that or

3058.48 --> 3062.8
don't believe it then you are going to

3060.64 --> 3066.5589999999997
find out and there's nothing

3062.8 --> 3069.8390000000004
anybody but you can do about it

3066.559 --> 3069.8390000000004
i've been there

3075.92 --> 3082.16
it's very simple to me don't

3078.96 --> 3084.64
meddle with the spirit

3082.16 --> 3086.3999999999996
like it's an experiment

3084.64 --> 3091.1189999999997
don't

3086.4 --> 3091.119
it's a defiling of the essence

3094.8 --> 3098.6400000000003
only heal

3096.559 --> 3100.8
only heal

3098.64 --> 3100.7999999999997
but

3102.88 --> 3107.119
poorly pig that doesn't really matter

3105.359 --> 3110.0789999999997
wicca craft

3107.119 --> 3112.96
it all comes from the same actions it's

3110.079 --> 3112.96
all the same

3123.68 --> 3128.8799999999997
i really find my symbolic side where the

3125.52 --> 3128.88
hell is it oh here is this

3134.16 --> 3140.7999999999997
all right i'm gonna share my page

3137.76 --> 3140.8
elements of life

3142.48 --> 3145.76
because that is what i

3145.839 --> 3150.0789999999997
read into it

3147.44 --> 3152.64
on rudolf steiner document

3150.079 --> 3154.319
and i've never read that before

3152.64 --> 3156.4
it's like

3154.319 --> 3157.68
did i just

3156.4 --> 3160.2400000000002
copy it

3157.68 --> 3164.3999999999996
through the spirit realm

3160.24 --> 3167.7599999999998
it i read it in the spirit realm

3164.4 --> 3170.48
and then we're like yes

3167.76 --> 3173.44
i'm going to

3170.48 --> 3174.88
simplify that and then write down this

3173.44 --> 3177.839
formula

3174.88 --> 3179.04
it is what i was doing back then

3177.839 --> 3181.68
guys

3179.04 --> 3183.52
i haven't read books

3181.68 --> 3186.0
like at all

3183.52 --> 3188.559
like i'm still like in the silly

3186.0 --> 3189.44
assumption that i i'm proud

3188.559 --> 3192.1600000000003
about

3189.44 --> 3195.599
completely reading the lord of the rings

3192.16 --> 3197.04
because i don't read books i don't

3195.599 --> 3201.599
yet

3197.04 --> 3203.92
out of me came these formulas

3201.599 --> 3206.7200000000003
without direct references

3203.92 --> 3209.359
and it works

3206.72 --> 3211.839
i almost made it in response to like

3209.359 --> 3212.72
reading wikibooks and all that i just

3211.839 --> 3215.359
thought

3212.72 --> 3217.5989999999997
you're doing it wrong this is stupid

3215.359 --> 3219.5989999999997
you're exoterizing and then making a

3217.599 --> 3222.1600000000003
total mess of it this is stupid it's

3219.599 --> 3225.599
wrong i'm gonna do it better that's kind

3222.16 --> 3227.839
of the motivation i had even to do it

3225.599 --> 3229.6800000000003
but then i'm reading back

3227.839 --> 3232.319
the rude of steiner's

3229.68 --> 3234.839
things from long long ago and it's like

3232.319 --> 3239.2
holy

3234.839 --> 3242.599
[ __ ] he's using the same system

3239.2 --> 3242.5989999999997
that's crazy

3251.28 --> 3255.8390000000004
anyway

3253.52 --> 3255.839
yeah

3258.559 --> 3262.8
okay well rest that look if you're into

3260.48 --> 3264.4
wicca or whatever that that's your issue

3262.8 --> 3267.76
you know

3264.4 --> 3267.76
i was for a while

3275.2 --> 3278.2
right

3278.4 --> 3284.48
and then i figured out like wait

3280.88 --> 3286.799
you don't need to do any of that

3284.48 --> 3288.799
simply no

3286.799 --> 3290.16
and then let the subconscious do

3288.799 --> 3291.7599999999998
everything

3290.16 --> 3295.04
everything

3291.76 --> 3298.4
who needs to cast spells

3295.04 --> 3300.72
why would you need focus items

3298.4 --> 3304.48
why would you need a ritual

3300.72 --> 3304.48
you don't need anything

3304.64 --> 3313.52
just need to know what is real

3309.119 --> 3313.52
and understand the principles

3314.079 --> 3319.04
how to navigate with the spirit

3317.359 --> 3322.319
through your life

3319.04 --> 3324.319
knowing the laws of god

3322.319 --> 3327.839
and the design

3324.319 --> 3327.839
and everything else out there

3328.48 --> 3332.839
and that was my con that was my final

3330.64 --> 3336.8799999999997
conclusion to it

3332.839 --> 3336.88
all and i've lifted

3339.92 --> 3344.0
oh you can enhance and it's fun okay

3342.559 --> 3346.6400000000003
well hey if you

3344.0 --> 3348.4
think it's fun to play around with the

3346.64 --> 3349.92
spirit

3348.4 --> 3352.64
you're going to be paying a price at

3349.92 --> 3354.799
some point because this spirit

3352.64 --> 3358.319
does not think it's fun to be played

3354.799 --> 3362.2
with unless it's like necessary

3358.319 --> 3362.2
like actually necessary

3363.2 --> 3367.359
so but that's up for you to find out

3368.319 --> 3372.48
anyway is there somebody else still left

3370.24 --> 3374.72
in chat besides rasta had i don't mind

3372.48 --> 3374.72
but

3374.799 --> 3378.799
hello hello hello where's everybody else

3382.96 --> 3388.2
no playing well then you're

3384.559 --> 3388.2000000000003
contradicting yourself

3409.28 --> 3412.0
hello jeff

3413.92 --> 3421.04
are y'all just listening in a trance

3417.04 --> 3421.04
i i tend to do that sometimes

3421.119 --> 3424.7200000000003
brutal steiner does that to me

3424.799 --> 3430.079
when i read it's just like

3427.76 --> 3430.079
man

3430.319 --> 3433.839
hey slow mo moon buggy

3457.44 --> 3462.48
is there a specific episode of your show

3460.319 --> 3465.599
where you go into more about the

3462.48 --> 3465.599
ancestral winds

3465.68 --> 3469.5989999999997
yeah

3467.2 --> 3472.799
i have one in that like in the title

3469.599 --> 3475.44
that's months ago by the way

3472.799 --> 3478.96
but yes if you want me to explain about

3475.44 --> 3478.96
it the ancestral winds is

3479.359 --> 3485.359
a descriptive way

3482.559 --> 3488.079
to kind of like give it a bit of weight

3485.359 --> 3490.72
of something that is kind of a natural

3488.079 --> 3494.079
spiritual process out there in the world

3490.72 --> 3494.0789999999997
that is season related

3497.52 --> 3502.64
and it is

3499.2 --> 3506.0
yeah definitively associated with the

3502.64 --> 3506.0
autumn phase

3506.16 --> 3509.44
and

3507.04 --> 3511.92
yeah maybe the winter too

3509.44 --> 3514.88
but it's def it always sets in somewhere

3511.92 --> 3516.88
in autumn for everybody

3514.88 --> 3518.319
and it is just like the

3516.88 --> 3520.6400000000003
the pool

3518.319 --> 3521.92
of spirit energy out there

3520.64 --> 3523.839
the pool

3521.92 --> 3526.319
well just imagine

3523.839 --> 3529.599
imagine it's not literal

3526.319 --> 3532.96
like it's all a big pool a literal like

3529.599 --> 3535.04
a swimming pool and everybody's in it

3532.96 --> 3537.68
well

3535.04 --> 3540.5589999999997
the water is going to reflect what's

3537.68 --> 3542.319
going through everybody

3540.559 --> 3543.52
right what's going through everybody

3542.319 --> 3544.48
literally

3543.52 --> 3547.68
so

3544.48 --> 3549.04
yeah if everybody is like

3547.68 --> 3552.0789999999997
breaking down

3549.04 --> 3553.359
getting a bit hysterical it's gonna kind

3552.079 --> 3556.0
of like

3553.359 --> 3559.119
smell like that

3556.0 --> 3561.2
and your body may also

3559.119 --> 3562.88
absorb some of that and that might

3561.2 --> 3565.359
trigger you

3562.88 --> 3567.359
to kind of maneuver

3565.359 --> 3569.52
on the spiritual level into the same

3567.359 --> 3572.72
direction to synchronize with everybody

3569.52 --> 3575.52
else which is really inconvenient

3572.72 --> 3577.5989999999997
most people the end of the summer

3575.52 --> 3579.839
and the autumn they kind of brace

3577.599 --> 3582.2400000000002
themselves for others

3579.839 --> 3586.48
as everybody kind of like falls and it's

3582.24 --> 3589.4399999999996
like going nuts right remember that

3586.48 --> 3591.359
but you can't hold on forever

3589.44 --> 3593.28
at some point you are going to be

3591.359 --> 3595.92
carried away

3593.28 --> 3598.3190000000004
if you have that sort of

3595.92 --> 3600.48
internal working where you're sensitive

3598.319 --> 3602.079
like me

3600.48 --> 3604.4
eventually it's gonna break down and

3602.079 --> 3607.599
then you're gonna be like functioning on

3604.4 --> 3609.2000000000003
that slightly lower level

3607.599 --> 3612.7200000000003
in your spirit

3609.2 --> 3615.359
because if you then start to like really

3612.72 --> 3617.1189999999997
start to

3615.359 --> 3619.839
say

3617.119 --> 3621.92
activate the energy

3619.839 --> 3625.359
then it's gonna have massive side

3621.92 --> 3626.7200000000003
effects instead of like in mid-summer

3625.359 --> 3629.44
late spring

3626.72 --> 3632.319
where the energy is just high

3629.44 --> 3635.2000000000003
and then when you activate the energy it

3632.319 --> 3637.04
works it all works

3635.2 --> 3639.359
and then in the autumn it suddenly

3637.04 --> 3640.839
doesn't work being really intense

3639.359 --> 3643.04
suddenly has side

3640.839 --> 3645.04
effects and that

3643.04 --> 3647.2
i designate to

3645.04 --> 3649.92
the ancestral winds

3647.2 --> 3651.359
which is a symbolic description

3649.92 --> 3654.88
for the

3651.359 --> 3658.4
weave the energy change

3654.88 --> 3658.4
that all of our spirits

3658.48 --> 3661.28
share

3659.92 --> 3664.16
like all of it

3661.28 --> 3667.76
including all life so it's not just

3664.16 --> 3671.1189999999997
humans that have this it's animals too

3667.76 --> 3672.3190000000004
animals adapt to the ancestral winds too

3671.119 --> 3674.88
plants

3672.319 --> 3676.88
obviously adapt to the ancestral winds

3674.88 --> 3678.799
it's literally the seasonal change they

3676.88 --> 3682.7200000000003
drop all their leaves why did they drop

3678.799 --> 3682.72
all their leaves because they don't work

3682.839 --> 3686.16
anymore see

3686.88 --> 3693.449
cestro wins hit all life

3690.3 --> 3693.449
[Music]

3698.319 --> 3704.799
yeah that's a good one psych bear but it

3700.96 --> 3704.799
you'll just have to find out for himself

3708.64 --> 3714.72
all right so i hope that explains a bit

3710.96 --> 3714.7200000000003
about the ancestor wins elise g

3716.16 --> 3722.68
is there anything else you need cleric

3718.72 --> 3722.68
clarification for

3751.2 --> 3755.839
one step at a time is a good pace

3756.0 --> 3762.079
right well

3758.319 --> 3763.599
it simply is like an in well in mostly

3762.079 --> 3765.2000000000003
inevitable

3763.599 --> 3767.039
with certain people it's really

3765.2 --> 3768.72
inevitable

3767.039 --> 3771.5200000000004
it differs

3768.72 --> 3774.64
because it depends on how strong you are

3771.52 --> 3776.96
and how sensitive you are in combination

3774.64 --> 3778.319
in how much the ancestral winds impact

3776.96 --> 3781.039
you

3778.319 --> 3781.0389999999998
when it happens

3781.68 --> 3786.0
fireworks welcome to the netherlands

3790.079 --> 3793.599
that's happened like all the time

3794.079 --> 3798.2400000000002
yeah it's getting close to new year's

3796.72 --> 3802.3999999999996
eve so

3798.24 --> 3802.3999999999996
it's been relatively modest so far

3803.92 --> 3807.2000000000003
never mind this

3808.799 --> 3811.839
are you seeing anything

3812.16 --> 3814.5589999999997
oh yeah

3820.72 --> 3825.839
ideally

3823.039 --> 3825.8390000000004
whatever

3827.92 --> 3831.88
i'm distracting myself

3838.4 --> 3843.2000000000003
all right but uh to get back to you

3840.16 --> 3844.319
elise g one step at a time well look

3843.2 --> 3846.319
once you

3844.319 --> 3848.96
are

3846.319 --> 3851.0389999999998
falling down from your peak

3848.96 --> 3852.7200000000003
position spiritually

3851.039 --> 3855.28
because of the ancestor when you take a

3852.72 --> 3857.9199999999996
step back yeah it might get a little

3855.28 --> 3860.6400000000003
rough on you right you might get

3857.92 --> 3861.92
like more easily stressed out like i

3860.64 --> 3864.96
typically

3861.92 --> 3867.359
have unfortunately

3864.96 --> 3870.16
you might have issues typically like

3867.359 --> 3871.5989999999997
manic depression or just straight out

3870.16 --> 3873.44
depression

3871.599 --> 3875.6800000000003
you have like a burden

3873.44 --> 3878.319
and to get out of that burden and not

3875.68 --> 3880.8799999999997
let it drag you down mentally

3878.319 --> 3883.44
right mentally very important what does

3880.88 --> 3886.0
your mind dwell on during these times if

3883.44 --> 3888.7200000000003
you're like oh i'm broken down it's all

3886.0 --> 3890.24
going to [ __ ] yeah that's not healthy

3888.72 --> 3891.9199999999996
avoid that

3890.24 --> 3893.7599999999998
right so it's very important during

3891.92 --> 3896.16
ancestral winds what are do you let your

3893.76 --> 3899.2000000000003
mind dwell on because you become more

3896.16 --> 3901.68
susceptible to nightmares

3899.2 --> 3905.1189999999997
and fear porn and all that so don't go

3901.68 --> 3907.2799999999997
there when you feel like it and then

3905.119 --> 3908.7200000000003
you of course want to get out of it

3907.28 --> 3910.7200000000003
that's what you're going to be looking

3908.72 --> 3912.5589999999997
forward to like i am going to get better

3910.72 --> 3915.4399999999996
this is the ancestral winds this is the

3912.559 --> 3917.599
autumn everybody's feeling like this

3915.44 --> 3921.039
i will get out of it well the way you

3917.599 --> 3922.48
actually do that is just indeed one step

3921.039 --> 3923.92
at a time

3922.48 --> 3926.48
just don't

3923.92 --> 3928.559
try to rush your way out of it because

3926.48 --> 3930.88
that never works

3928.559 --> 3933.92
just take it easy

3930.88 --> 3935.839
give your body time to heal because yeah

3933.92 --> 3938.319
when the ancestral winds hit

3935.839 --> 3940.48
it's not just the spirit that can't

3938.319 --> 3943.839
attain the higher level function your

3940.48 --> 3946.4
body is going to go through a lot of

3943.839 --> 3948.88
like cleaning up processes lots of

3946.4 --> 3952.64
people get sick get the flu guess what

3948.88 --> 3954.799
cleaning up process lots of people get

3952.64 --> 3956.96
their weak points in their body become

3954.799 --> 3958.48
highlighted

3956.96 --> 3960.799
right

3958.48 --> 3962.72
because they are all going through like

3960.799 --> 3964.24
metabolic

3962.72 --> 3966.319
changes

3964.24 --> 3967.5989999999997
trying to fix issues that's what your

3966.319 --> 3970.24
body does

3967.599 --> 3973.28
in that period that's also why it's very

3970.24 --> 3975.2799999999997
important to eat healthy

3973.28 --> 3976.8390000000004
during such a period during that period

3975.28 --> 3978.7200000000003
that's why suddenly

3976.839 --> 3982.799
everybody

3978.72 --> 3985.2
will well most cases need

3982.799 --> 3987.119
a chicken broccoli dinner

3985.2 --> 3989.839
because suddenly your body's like yeah

3987.119 --> 3991.599
man we can really use it now i mean

3989.839 --> 3994.24
during the springtime that was great and

3991.599 --> 3997.52
was really tasty and euphoric

3994.24 --> 3999.839
but we really need it now now we can

3997.52 --> 4002.24
actually use that

3999.839 --> 4004.64
to like reconstruct things because

4002.24 --> 4006.9599999999996
that's the time of the year

4004.64 --> 4008.4
it's the ancestral winds it's

4006.96 --> 4010.96
breaking down

4008.4 --> 4012.559
rebuilding

4010.96 --> 4016.88
but you gotta

4012.559 --> 4018.7200000000003
let it happen right when you're like

4016.88 --> 4020.6400000000003
building a building

4018.72 --> 4022.5589999999997
you don't rush people you're not like

4020.64 --> 4024.24
hey hurry up uh we don't have time for

4022.559 --> 4026.1600000000003
this hurry up like quicker quicker

4024.24 --> 4028.8799999999997
quicker you don't do that because what

4026.16 --> 4032.0
you're gonna end up with a broken house

4028.88 --> 4034.7200000000003
it's rushed you overlooked things

4032.0 --> 4037.599
there's gonna be structural damage or

4034.72 --> 4039.7599999999998
weaknesses if you rush it so you gotta

4037.599 --> 4042.2400000000002
let it just

4039.76 --> 4046.2400000000002
it's at a steady pace let it do its

4042.24 --> 4046.24
thing one step at a time

4046.4 --> 4050.319
right i hope that

4048.559 --> 4052.48
that clarifies

4050.319 --> 4055.599
the value of that one little thing you

4052.48 --> 4059.92
just said because it is very true and i

4055.599 --> 4059.92
hope i just explained completely why

4060.48 --> 4066.52
elise g thank you for that now let me

4062.96 --> 4066.52
read up on chat

4077.68 --> 4081.52
what

4079.28 --> 4083.44
there is two islands

4081.52 --> 4085.599
right next to each other

4083.44 --> 4089.28
on international timeline that have

4085.599 --> 4091.839
sunrises four hours apart

4089.28 --> 4091.8390000000004
what

4092.24 --> 4094.5589999999997
what

4095.359 --> 4100.3189999999995
are they actually

4098.08 --> 4100.3189999999995
like

4101.839 --> 4107.2789999999995
what's the distance between those what's

4104.88 --> 4111.4400000000005
the official actual distance between

4107.279 --> 4111.4400000000005
those islands slo-mo moon buggy

4111.52 --> 4115.159000000001
that's really interesting

4119.759 --> 4124.719
what's that firework it's fireworks

4122.799 --> 4126.48
it's all day long

4124.719 --> 4128.56
and then like it's

4126.48 --> 4133.12
officially it's forbidden

4128.56 --> 4135.04
they do it all day long all day long

4133.12 --> 4137.199
hello

4135.04 --> 4139.199
my internet got disconnected

4137.199 --> 4140.96
it's back

4139.199 --> 4143.599999999999
but yeah i was saying

4140.96 --> 4144.96
it's fireworks it's the netherlands it's

4143.6 --> 4146.4800000000005
all day long

4144.96 --> 4148.56
people don't give a [ __ ] whether it's

4146.48 --> 4151.599999999999
illegal or not they are just doing it

4148.56 --> 4153.679
all day long and that's the netherlands

4151.6 --> 4156.96
so that's what you're hearing it's not a

4153.679 --> 4160.0
war it's never a war it's fireworks all

4156.96 --> 4162.88
day long december it's the netherlands

4160.0 --> 4166.239
it's always like that always it has

4162.88 --> 4168.88
always been like that my entire life

4166.239 --> 4171.2789999999995
fireworks all day long

4168.88 --> 4172.719
december it's the netherlands get used

4171.279 --> 4175.4400000000005
to it

4172.719 --> 4178.56
don't keep asking about it it's never

4175.44 --> 4180.719
anything else it's just fireworks all

4178.56 --> 4186.279
day long in the netherlands in the month

4180.719 --> 4186.279
of december it's always like that always

4189.839 --> 4192.839
uh

4203.679 --> 4210.0
first open one f1 oh he did

4207.04 --> 4212.56
okay jeff gassett we get it

4210.0 --> 4215.88
somebody won a race

4212.56 --> 4215.88
that's cool

4217.04 --> 4222.88
maybe that's why they're shooting off

4218.64 --> 4225.04
fireworks i mean they're yeah could be

4222.88 --> 4227.4400000000005
did he just win it i heard yesterday

4225.04 --> 4230.4
somebody like crying out in euphoria

4227.44 --> 4233.839999999999
about some sports thing

4230.4 --> 4233.839999999999
i don't really follow sports

4240.0 --> 4244.0
right anyway yeah it's slow mo moon

4242.08 --> 4245.84
buggy

4244.0 --> 4248.719
i will check out that link it sounds

4245.84 --> 4248.719
really interesting

4249.44 --> 4252.44
wait

4258.08 --> 4260.4
whoa

4264.0 --> 4268.8
i'm gonna take a careful look at that

4266.239 --> 4273.04
that's it looks really interesting and

4268.8 --> 4275.360000000001
surreal because if it's actually a real

4273.04 --> 4277.36
distance that's like mapped out between

4275.36 --> 4278.639999999999
the islands it's like

4277.36 --> 4281.199
rastered

4278.64 --> 4283.76
it is like completely outlined with

4281.199 --> 4286.879999999999
actual distances and then there is this

4283.76 --> 4289.679
massive sun differential sun position

4286.88 --> 4292.2390000000005
that's really surreal

4289.679 --> 4295.28
of course it's holographic but even if

4292.239 --> 4297.04
it is holographic that's really bizarre

4295.28 --> 4298.96
that's like a

4297.04 --> 4301.6
distinct

4298.96 --> 4304.08
deviation aberration

4301.6 --> 4305.92
in the solar cons in the solar angular

4304.08 --> 4308.719
consistency if that's the case that's

4305.92 --> 4311.6
like a real aberration fascinating

4308.719 --> 4315.04
i am going to take a look at that video

4311.6 --> 4317.6
slow mo moon buggy thank you very much

4315.04 --> 4321.88
i will look at it yeah right i'm gonna

4317.6 --> 4321.88
take two minute break i'll be right back

4408.08 --> 4414.48
it's not just time zone change at the

4410.719 --> 4414.4800000000005
dateline is it

4420.88 --> 4426.4800000000005
oh okay

4423.76 --> 4428.719
oh that's disappointing then

4426.48 --> 4433.12
if it's just a stupid convention issue

4428.719 --> 4433.12
yeah that that's not really special

4433.36 --> 4436.719
yeah okay

4434.96 --> 4438.64
i thought there was an actual solar

4436.719 --> 4441.84
angular aberration

4438.64 --> 4441.84
that's interesting

4443.52 --> 4448.0
right but i'm gonna check out the video

4445.6 --> 4448.0
anyway

4448.32 --> 4451.88
thanks for the tip

4460.96 --> 4465.6
right so yeah i hope you guys by the way

4462.96 --> 4468.159
are enjoying the show

4465.6 --> 4471.679
this is kind of what i was wanting to do

4468.159 --> 4473.92
yesterday but then i got really sick

4471.679 --> 4473.92
so

4474.48 --> 4479.28
but i think i've now basically discussed

4476.96 --> 4483.8
all the subjects that were really on my

4479.28 --> 4483.8
mind that i couldn't get out yesterday

4486.32 --> 4492.08
and i really appreciate all of you your

4489.6 --> 4492.08
you guys

4492.719 --> 4498.96
all of the input of you guys

4496.159 --> 4500.48
i think you can see all of your guys

4498.96 --> 4501.44
input

4500.48 --> 4503.04
that

4501.44 --> 4506.4
i don't even know how to control

4503.04 --> 4506.4
construct that sentence

4507.679 --> 4511.2390000000005
you know what i mean

4532.88 --> 4539.0
remind you of bob ross

4535.04 --> 4539.0
the fluffy little clouds

4540.96 --> 4544.2390000000005
does he have the hair too

4548.159 --> 4552.799999999999
or on my team i appreciate that steamy

4550.8 --> 4554.88
traveler

4552.8 --> 4557.76
and at least g and slow mo moon yeah i

4554.88 --> 4558.88
really guys i really appreciate i even i

4557.76 --> 4562.400000000001
even

4558.88 --> 4564.159000000001
appreciate the rest that no i do

4562.4 --> 4565.12
i mean he's

4564.159 --> 4566.48
dude

4565.12 --> 4568.64
rasta like

4566.48 --> 4571.04
he when he freaking pokes he just

4568.64 --> 4572.96
punches a hole through [ __ ]

4571.04 --> 4576.159
and it can be a bit of a nuisance but i

4572.96 --> 4578.84
still value his

4576.159 --> 4581.28
his input

4578.84 --> 4584.8
and i don't know

4581.28 --> 4584.8
i think you fit right in

4589.84 --> 4594.1990000000005
it's more the voice okay okay

4594.239 --> 4598.32
you realize by the way that bob ross is

4596.239 --> 4600.5599999999995
probably not even a singular person

4598.32 --> 4600.5599999999995
right

4601.52 --> 4605.040000000001
he's like more like a project

4606.56 --> 4610.8
with several different people that just

4608.64 --> 4612.88
use that hair and use that way of

4610.8 --> 4614.08
speaking

4612.88 --> 4616.719
but

4614.08 --> 4618.88
might be just a weird little conspiracy

4616.719 --> 4622.76
rumor i heard but

4618.88 --> 4622.76
it makes sense though

4624.96 --> 4627.199
ah

4635.28 --> 4641.92
but yeah anyway i appreciate steamy

4637.92 --> 4641.92
traveler being on my team

4646.64 --> 4651.84
there is a lot of things to uh to

4649.44 --> 4651.839999999999
explore

4652.56 --> 4657.92
and it's very hard to find somebody

4655.28 --> 4657.92
especially

4658.4 --> 4663.12
that's not just somebody in chat

4661.04 --> 4664.88
but like have their own channels and

4663.12 --> 4667.36
exploits

4664.88 --> 4667.36
yeah to

4669.84 --> 4673.28
it's very hard to connect

4673.36 --> 4678.799999999999
out there

4675.6 --> 4681.52
example like trying to find somebody

4678.8 --> 4684.4800000000005
that can even

4681.52 --> 4686.8
like entertain the idea of

4684.48 --> 4689.919999999999
spatial looping mechanics

4686.8 --> 4691.4400000000005
as a potential outcome

4689.92 --> 4695.52
an option

4691.44 --> 4696.719
as in not absolutely sure not claimed

4695.52 --> 4700.320000000001
but

4696.719 --> 4704.56
reasoned out how to falsify right even

4700.32 --> 4707.199
that just just that alone

4704.56 --> 4710.2390000000005
knowing how to be able to prove

4707.199 --> 4711.919999999999
something right or wrong is very rare

4710.239 --> 4714.5599999999995
out here

4711.92 --> 4717.679
it's very rare that people even do that

4714.56 --> 4719.04
and even recognize the value of such

4717.679 --> 4721.84
aspect

4719.04 --> 4721.84
and yeah

4722.159 --> 4727.759999999999
people that i had very high intellectual

4724.8 --> 4731.4400000000005
regard for seem to have

4727.76 --> 4731.4400000000005
totally dropped the ball on that

4731.679 --> 4738.92
and that was part of why i was so sick

4734.56 --> 4738.92
yesterday because of the shock

4748.239 --> 4752.08
no sound what are you talking about

4752.239 --> 4755.799999999999
that's you bro

4814.639 --> 4818.88
okay psych bear i can't believe you're

4817.52 --> 4820.080000000001
actually

4818.88 --> 4822.96
even

4820.08 --> 4825.04
verbally communicating

4822.96 --> 4828.08
taking a promise from fight to flat

4825.04 --> 4831.36
earth about such a thing

4828.08 --> 4834.159
you're actually waiting for that that's

4831.36 --> 4836.88
that's a very silly thing to say

4834.159 --> 4838.5599999999995
it's like waiting for rompus to finally

4836.88 --> 4840.88
give you the data that proves

4838.56 --> 4841.84
terrestrial refraction in this model

4840.88 --> 4843.76
right

4841.84 --> 4846.8
it's been like what is it now

4843.76 --> 4850.52
five years

4846.8 --> 4850.52
it's never gonna happen

4866.32 --> 4869.32
do

4883.84 --> 4886.84
ah

4888.56 --> 4892.88
right

4889.6 --> 4895.04
been going for an hour 20 minutes so far

4892.88 --> 4897.1990000000005
i could continue on

4895.04 --> 4900.199
i mean yeah i only had a half hour

4897.199 --> 4900.199
yesterday

4902.0 --> 4906.719
if there is

4904.159 --> 4906.719
animo

4906.96 --> 4910.88
to talk about

4908.8 --> 4912.96
because i'm kind of like i've

4910.88 --> 4915.12
pretty much

4912.96 --> 4917.84
went through all the subjects i wanted

4915.12 --> 4917.84
to go through

4939.52 --> 4942.8
thank you for your consistency with the

4941.84 --> 4946.08
show

4942.8 --> 4949.1990000000005
you're welcome i mean it's weird though

4946.08 --> 4951.679
that i do also get on when i'm like sick

4949.199 --> 4953.839999999999
it's weird

4951.679 --> 4955.76
at least i'm not like trying to sit

4953.84 --> 4956.96
through like a full two-hour show and

4955.76 --> 4959.12
i'm like that

4956.96 --> 4960.56
because they would literally end up

4959.12 --> 4963.12
throwing up

4960.56 --> 4966.56
that would be crazy

4963.12 --> 4970.0
but the weirdest thing is that

4966.56 --> 4972.96
usually when like yesterday

4970.0 --> 4975.76
i feel a little tense right but then i

4972.96 --> 4978.4800000000005
don't expect to actually feel sick like

4975.76 --> 4980.400000000001
if i would feel that sick

4978.48 --> 4982.4
before the show had even started then i

4980.4 --> 4983.92
would just say guys i'm feeling sick i'm

4982.4 --> 4986.799999999999
not doing this

4983.92 --> 4990.2390000000005
but usually i then i just think like no

4986.8 --> 4992.639
no no i can do that and then i do it and

4990.239 --> 4996.638999999999
then i get sick it's

4992.639 --> 4999.1990000000005
then it just starts to show like nope

4996.639 --> 5001.52
that's not gonna work

4999.199 --> 5004.159
but i pretty much only know after i

5001.52 --> 5006.96
start the the

5004.159 --> 5009.599999999999
this the streaming the play streaming

5006.96 --> 5013.04
button on obs that's when it suddenly

5009.6 --> 5013.04
hits me it's weird

5013.44 --> 5019.04
but yes i am very dedicated to basically

5016.88 --> 5021.28
always be here

5019.04 --> 5021.28
right

5024.639 --> 5028.639
to be

5026.239 --> 5030.718999999999
consistently available like yeah this is

5028.639 --> 5033.04
a gathering place this show

5030.719 --> 5035.84
you can always find me here at this

5033.04 --> 5039.5199999999995
certain time of the day

5035.84 --> 5039.52
it's what i always wanted to have

5040.08 --> 5046.8
so that people yeah i'm not expecting

5044.08 --> 5048.639
like everybody to literally drop

5046.8 --> 5050.639
whatever they're doing and just

5048.639 --> 5053.04
rearrange their life to always be

5050.639 --> 5055.92
present here

5053.04 --> 5058.639
but i just want them to realize i'm

5055.92 --> 5058.639
always here

5059.52 --> 5064.2390000000005
you can always rely on that i'm here

5061.679 --> 5064.2390000000005
doing this

5064.639 --> 5069.4400000000005
and that's oh yeah that kind of virtual

5067.36 --> 5071.36
promise to the world is also the thing

5069.44 --> 5073.919999999999
that

5071.36 --> 5076.96
makes the idea of like having to quit

5073.92 --> 5079.76
this show for like financial reasons

5076.96 --> 5083.44
really punishing because it feels like i

5079.76 --> 5086.96
would be breaking that promise you see

5083.44 --> 5086.96
and i really don't wanna

5087.84 --> 5091.12
that's why i get so upset when i feel

5090.0 --> 5093.12
like i

5091.12 --> 5094.48
i

5093.12 --> 5096.32
yeah

5094.48 --> 5097.919999999999
anyway

5096.32 --> 5099.12
but yeah things have been pretty good

5097.92 --> 5101.12
since the

5099.12 --> 5103.92
fundraiser

5101.12 --> 5103.92
night owl show

5104.719 --> 5110.0
but yeah it's not gonna last forever

5108.159 --> 5112.159
just so you guys know i

5110.0 --> 5114.719
definitely can still use the continuing

5112.159 --> 5116.239
support i mean the direct crisis was

5114.719 --> 5118.639
averted but

5116.239 --> 5121.5199999999995
that that doesn't mean that's like a

5118.639 --> 5123.6
permanent solution

5121.52 --> 5126.400000000001
only permanent solution would be regular

5123.6 --> 5127.92
support

5126.4 --> 5131.199
and there's really nothing i can do

5127.92 --> 5131.1990000000005
about that i'm sorry

5131.36 --> 5136.5599999999995
i mean i wish some of like my

5133.84 --> 5139.28
attempts of financial side projects the

5136.56 --> 5142.400000000001
gt i wish that would work out

5139.28 --> 5144.159
it just isn't happening

5142.4 --> 5146.32
it's very disappointing like very

5144.159 --> 5147.759999999999
disappointing to me

5146.32 --> 5151.759999999999
i had really

5147.76 --> 5151.76
like hoped that it would

5153.679 --> 5157.52
but yeah

5155.679 --> 5159.84
i don't know yeah maybe it wasn't meant

5157.52 --> 5161.679
to be maybe it'll still come maybe at

5159.84 --> 5163.52
some point it will just fix itself i

5161.679 --> 5166.159
mean i'm not

5163.52 --> 5168.8
putting money in i'm not losing money to

5166.159 --> 5170.96
it at least right that's at least

5168.8 --> 5171.76
a good thing i'm not losing anything to

5170.96 --> 5173.84
it

5171.76 --> 5176.159000000001
don't have to reinvest it just to keep

5173.84 --> 5177.52
it alive or something

5176.159 --> 5179.36
but

5177.52 --> 5180.56
yeah it's not yielding what i had hoped

5179.36 --> 5182.799999999999
for

5180.56 --> 5185.1990000000005
if it would then i probably would be

5182.8 --> 5187.28
financially stable right now it was my

5185.199 --> 5188.879999999999
original plan

5187.28 --> 5191.5199999999995
for doing this

5188.88 --> 5194.0
gti on the side it would stabilize my

5191.52 --> 5197.360000000001
finances so i could purely focus on that

5194.0 --> 5198.639
that was my plan that plan doesn't work

5197.36 --> 5201.12
anymore

5198.639 --> 5206.2390000000005
i can only do this now with

5201.12 --> 5208.0
regular support from viewers and fans

5206.239 --> 5211.839999999999
and i'm afraid there at this point

5208.0 --> 5211.84
there's nothing i can do about it

5212.96 --> 5217.88
except just try to be worth it

5225.44 --> 5229.919999999999
like being a musician musician you have

5227.679 --> 5232.2390000000005
to be a hundred percent

5229.92 --> 5234.0
yeah

5232.239 --> 5236.08
it's a good spot to throw around ideas

5234.0 --> 5237.92
yeah i certainly hope so i certainly

5236.08 --> 5240.0
damn well hope so that the flat earth

5237.92 --> 5241.92
early bird is that spot

5240.0 --> 5244.56
where you throw out

5241.92 --> 5247.6
like ideas that you know are

5244.56 --> 5249.679
tintillating and potentially beyond

5247.6 --> 5251.280000000001
what a lot of people can even understand

5249.679 --> 5252.719
yet

5251.28 --> 5254.639
this is the place

5252.719 --> 5257.6
where you can throw out ideas that are

5254.639 --> 5257.6
ahead of their time

5259.28 --> 5263.12
well maybe not business oriented ahead

5261.679 --> 5263.92
of their time

5263.12 --> 5266.48
but

5263.92 --> 5269.52
like mentally and spiritually ahead of

5266.48 --> 5272.239
their time yes this is the place

5269.52 --> 5274.4800000000005
i know how to deal with those things i i

5272.239 --> 5277.36
can

5274.48 --> 5281.04
well like happened earlier right

5277.36 --> 5283.12
at least g asked me a couple of things

5281.04 --> 5286.08
notice again

5283.12 --> 5286.08
let me scroll back

5288.239 --> 5294.718999999999
like oh yeah like what are the ancestral

5290.639 --> 5294.719
winds basically and then

5294.8 --> 5297.679
i lay it down

5300.0 --> 5304.6
and i can do that with other things too

5325.6 --> 5329.360000000001
i

5326.56 --> 5330.96
like who did [ __ ] gifts [ __ ] about that

5329.36 --> 5334.44
guy

5330.96 --> 5334.44
but whatever

5367.36 --> 5372.4
psych bear you can't help poking the

5369.679 --> 5374.4
anti-flat earthers

5372.4 --> 5376.879999999999
it seems to be a real thing they can't

5374.4 --> 5380.5599999999995
help themselves either

5376.88 --> 5382.8
i'm just glad that i can help myself

5380.56 --> 5386.0
by literally

5382.8 --> 5387.76
not engaging at all

5386.0 --> 5390.639
like i might give a

5387.76 --> 5392.4800000000005
short glance on things

5390.639 --> 5393.84
and then i'll size up like what's going

5392.48 --> 5396.08
on here what's the frequency where are

5393.84 --> 5397.76
they at where are they at in the cycle

5396.08 --> 5400.0
that they're stuck in

5397.76 --> 5402.56
and then i might even like relay that

5400.0 --> 5405.28
analysis on the flat earth debate or on

5402.56 --> 5407.120000000001
my show if somebody asks

5405.28 --> 5410.32
i don't engage

5407.12 --> 5414.8
i'm not gonna like send comments that

5410.32 --> 5417.599999999999
to point out how ridiculous their entire

5414.8 --> 5417.6
endeavor is

5418.239 --> 5421.5199999999995
because it's so superfluous at this

5420.239 --> 5423.839999999999
point the only thing that happens is

5421.52 --> 5426.88
that they're gonna like

5423.84 --> 5430.400000000001
reverse that around 180 degrees and then

5426.88 --> 5433.28
project exactly that right back on me

5430.4 --> 5435.12
like almost cookie cutter six-year-old

5433.28 --> 5437.4
know you

5435.12 --> 5439.4
that that's what they do and they do it

5437.4 --> 5442.5599999999995
every single time

5439.4 --> 5445.44
every single time and it's literally a

5442.56 --> 5447.52
waste of my time

5445.44 --> 5452.159
i don't want to get entangled with that

5447.52 --> 5452.159000000001
with my energy it's such a waste of time

5452.56 --> 5457.4400000000005
but hey if you

5454.48 --> 5459.5199999999995
get some kind of amusement out of it

5457.44 --> 5462.08
then yeah

5459.52 --> 5464.2390000000005
you know it's not that bad it's just a

5462.08 --> 5466.4
bit of a waste of energy in my opinion

5464.239 --> 5468.959999999999
but hey

5466.4 --> 5472.239
it's your energy you know it's your you

5468.96 --> 5474.88
it's your attention that you put to it

5472.239 --> 5476.718999999999
that you spent on it so

5474.88 --> 5479.52
yeah

5476.719 --> 5481.76
you know it's a free market it's a free

5479.52 --> 5486.0
market of

5481.76 --> 5486.0
of energy spirit and attention

5486.8 --> 5490.360000000001
and money allegedly

5490.4 --> 5493.44
but that's yeah

5494.4 --> 5498.44
a free spirit market

5511.679 --> 5515.1990000000005
look at that

5513.6 --> 5517.6
look at that

5515.199 --> 5520.5599999999995
isn't that just cute

5517.6 --> 5520.56
but it's wrong

5521.199 --> 5524.32
still hilarious though

5528.08 --> 5533.12
the day you truly wake up and realize

5531.199 --> 5536.239
the earth is not flat

5533.12 --> 5537.36
things will start looking up for you

5536.239 --> 5539.599999999999
i'm sure

5537.36 --> 5542.0
you will get a whole lot more support

5539.6 --> 5545.360000000001
financially

5542.0 --> 5546.88
from us so-called ballers well i already

5545.36 --> 5550.88
get support

5546.88 --> 5552.639
from you so-called ballers

5550.88 --> 5554.88
i literally do

5552.639 --> 5558.36
i have baller supporters that send me

5554.88 --> 5558.36
paypal money

5560.0 --> 5564.4
i think i might actually be getting a

5562.48 --> 5565.919999999999
pretty decent amount

5564.4 --> 5567.839999999999
compared to

5565.92 --> 5570.639
other people out there

5567.84 --> 5570.639
from ballers

5571.199 --> 5575.759999999999
all right and like

5572.88 --> 5579.28
to me

5575.76 --> 5581.04
getting money from ballers is special

5579.28 --> 5582.96
it is special

5581.04 --> 5585.04
i mean getting money from flat earthers

5582.96 --> 5586.96
is awesome

5585.04 --> 5589.76
it is awesome but getting money from

5586.96 --> 5592.4
actual ballers is special

5589.76 --> 5592.400000000001
it's like

5592.56 --> 5597.6
morally compelling a jew to give you a

5595.44 --> 5600.5599999999995
gold coin

5597.6 --> 5606.04
giving it not selling it not trading it

5600.56 --> 5606.04
giving it right it's special to me

5623.12 --> 5626.12
so

5655.679 --> 5661.1990000000005
i mean

5657.12 --> 5661.199
i certainly hope you guys get that

5666.239 --> 5674.08
i mean if anybody knows an example

5670.48 --> 5676.638999999999
of that actually happening

5674.08 --> 5676.639
actually

5680.4 --> 5684.96
i've never heard of it happening ever so

5683.199 --> 5687.199
what i said right

5684.96 --> 5689.6
so yeah that would be very special and

5687.199 --> 5691.36
for me getting donations from ballers is

5689.6 --> 5695.92
very special

5691.36 --> 5695.92
because they all know i'm a flat earther

5696.8 --> 5699.28
and that's

5698.159 --> 5701.839999999999
yeah

5699.28 --> 5701.84
that's special

5704.8 --> 5712.84
it means that they can

5707.92 --> 5714.719
kind of set aside their political

5712.84 --> 5718.0
view

5714.719 --> 5720.639
and just be human

5718.0 --> 5723.36
that's that's good i like that i like

5720.639 --> 5723.36
that idea

5727.6 --> 5732.0
or just ignore it right and just

5734.8 --> 5741.159000000001
i don't know what you guys are doing

5736.239 --> 5741.159
gardening or doing the dishes or

5750.8 --> 5753.1990000000005
what

5753.6 --> 5762.2390000000005
social distance measuring stick

5757.44 --> 5762.239
used by german police okay that sounds

5766.4 --> 5770.5199999999995
just unbelievably stupid

5782.8 --> 5786.400000000001
they wouldn't exist without us

5785.52 --> 5788.400000000001
um

5786.4 --> 5790.96
not entirely true

5788.4 --> 5792.4
but flat earthers certainly give them

5790.96 --> 5794.88
something to

5792.4 --> 5797.599999999999
to deal with constantly

5794.88 --> 5799.84
right that's that's for certain

5797.6 --> 5803.76
but to say they wouldn't exist without

5799.84 --> 5803.76
us that's you don't know that

5805.52 --> 5810.4800000000005
i mean people like this like these

5808.4 --> 5813.679
ballers anti-flat earthers have been

5810.48 --> 5815.839999999999
around even before 2015.

5813.679 --> 5818.8
it's just people

5815.84 --> 5821.52
science people

5818.8 --> 5824.08
hobbyists astrophysics that just like to

5821.52 --> 5827.4400000000005
blabber online that's that's existed for

5824.08 --> 5830.32
a while that's not unique to the

5827.44 --> 5832.5599999999995
appearance of flat earth in 2015.

5830.32 --> 5834.239
i mean they got a lot of boost and

5832.56 --> 5837.119000000001
incentive to

5834.239 --> 5839.04
they basically we've been put to test to

5837.119 --> 5840.5599999999995
go after us

5839.04 --> 5841.76
that's how they became anti-flat

5840.56 --> 5844.080000000001
earthers

5841.76 --> 5845.76
but even without flat earthers around

5844.08 --> 5849.6
they would still wait they would have

5845.76 --> 5852.639
still been there doing what they do

5849.6 --> 5855.84
so i don't think that it's a

5852.639 --> 5855.84
like a claim you can

5856.96 --> 5859.76
you can cash

5861.84 --> 5866.84
but yeah since flat earth is there the

5864.56 --> 5870.4800000000005
anti-flat earthers and all these

5866.84 --> 5874.2390000000005
these ball cosmology wizards certainly

5870.48 --> 5876.879999999999
have had a lot of things to work with

5874.239 --> 5878.879999999999
because of us that is true

5876.88 --> 5880.8
they probably did get a lot more

5878.88 --> 5883.36
attention thanks to the existence of

5880.8 --> 5885.4400000000005
flat earthers that is for sure oh

5883.36 --> 5888.239
hey thank you gorzilla

5885.44 --> 5890.0
37 for the 10 canadian dollars

5888.239 --> 5892.4
in the super chat thank you very much

5890.0 --> 5895.4
mary flatness or win he

5892.4 --> 5895.4
cool

5903.36 --> 5907.759999999999
what i'm trying to tell you is you are

5905.44 --> 5910.4
actually more entertaining than most of

5907.76 --> 5913.04
the flat earthers on youtube and you

5910.4 --> 5914.799999999999
could do better

5913.04 --> 5915.76
than you are

5914.8 --> 5918.08
really

5915.76 --> 5918.08
how

5920.159 --> 5924.48
i mean

5921.84 --> 5927.28
almost everything i talk about half the

5924.48 --> 5929.839999999999
things i talk about relate

5927.28 --> 5932.48
to either

5929.84 --> 5935.04
mechanically the flat nature of earth

5932.48 --> 5938.48
and cosmogeny which none of that fits in

5935.04 --> 5940.639
the ball cosmology ever

5938.48 --> 5943.28
and the other half is about how

5940.639 --> 5944.639
everybody pretty much lives in a world

5943.28 --> 5947.04
where you're

5944.639 --> 5949.28
believing me being made to believe

5947.04 --> 5951.84
delusions

5949.28 --> 5953.759999999999
how could i transform how could i even

5951.84 --> 5956.56
consider

5953.76 --> 5958.2390000000005
a viable option in the transforming of

5956.56 --> 5960.96
my

5958.239 --> 5962.799999999999
flat earthness into a baller that's not

5960.96 --> 5965.04
possible

5962.8 --> 5968.159000000001
there can be no

5965.04 --> 5969.84
ball earth early bird show

5968.159 --> 5972.32
it wouldn't work

5969.84 --> 5975.6
it would not be interesting

5972.32 --> 5979.04
it would just end up being another

5975.6 --> 5981.679
baller zealot retirement home situation

5979.04 --> 5984.639
with sean hawkins and all the retards

5981.679 --> 5986.159
just constantly being there yeah i might

5984.639 --> 5988.56
get some money

5986.159 --> 5990.239
but there would be no ideas it would all

5988.56 --> 5994.4400000000005
bleed dry

5990.239 --> 5994.44
if i did that guaranteed

5996.0 --> 6000.639
he's basically asking yeah of course but

5998.32 --> 6003.92
he doesn't know that though he thinks

6000.639 --> 6003.92
he's not lying so

6004.0 --> 6007.36
but yeah that's that's what it would

6005.679 --> 6009.6
come down to slow mo moon buggy i

6007.36 --> 6012.0
realized that

6009.6 --> 6013.76
but yeah that can't work

6012.0 --> 6016.719
like i cannot

6013.76 --> 6019.92
lie for money like i can't do it's not

6016.719 --> 6023.76
like i don't want to do i can't do it

6019.92 --> 6025.92
why because as soon as i would

6023.76 --> 6028.88
all my power

6025.92 --> 6030.32
all the cohesion all the inside the

6028.88 --> 6032.96
sharpness

6030.32 --> 6035.36
of the virtual things it would all

6032.96 --> 6038.56
crumble right before me and i wouldn't

6035.36 --> 6038.5599999999995
be able to get it back

6039.04 --> 6046.08
it can't work if i accept lies

6042.48 --> 6049.759999999999
it can't work i literally cannot be

6046.08 --> 6052.159
who i am and function the way i do if i

6049.76 --> 6054.0
would choose to accept lies

6052.159 --> 6056.719
it's a physical

6054.0 --> 6059.36
impossibility you understand

6056.719 --> 6062.719
i don't have a choice

6059.36 --> 6065.119
if i would have had the choice

6062.719 --> 6067.119
to do it then that's how i would have

6065.119 --> 6068.719
started out

6067.119 --> 6069.839999999999
and i would have never been a flat

6068.719 --> 6073.199
earther

6069.84 --> 6073.1990000000005
i don't have a choice

6073.44 --> 6079.839999999999
i have to go bob why i

6076.8 --> 6081.119000000001
with what i know to be true i have no

6079.84 --> 6082.639
choice

6081.119 --> 6084.08
if i choose

6082.639 --> 6086.08
the other thing

6084.08 --> 6088.719
something else

6086.08 --> 6090.4
i am no longer what i am i no longer

6088.719 --> 6095.199
have the power

6090.4 --> 6095.199
that i have if i would do that

6095.36 --> 6098.799999999999
god would take it away

6097.6 --> 6100.88
naturally

6098.8 --> 6103.1990000000005
through the logical consequences of

6100.88 --> 6104.639
spirit mechanics i would no longer be

6103.199 --> 6107.839999999999
what i am

6104.639 --> 6107.84
i have no choice

6108.0 --> 6113.36
i mean it's already halfway risky

6110.88 --> 6115.52
that i do ballwin reenactments it's

6113.36 --> 6117.679
literally risky guys you think that's a

6115.52 --> 6120.2390000000005
joke it isn't

6117.679 --> 6122.96
and i get really weird side effects from

6120.239 --> 6122.959999999999
it sometimes

6128.88 --> 6133.84
can't turn a pickle back into a cucumber

6131.36 --> 6136.48
that's that's a hilarious way to say it

6133.84 --> 6136.4800000000005
godzilla

6142.4 --> 6146.599999999999
oh i'll slow my moon buggy that's

6153.6 --> 6158.2390000000005
right but the lying

6155.679 --> 6161.28
has always been a big problem to me too

6158.239 --> 6164.718999999999
when it comes to society because yeah

6161.28 --> 6166.8
i'm a talker i'm a communicator

6164.719 --> 6169.84
guess what's the most prevalent type of

6166.8 --> 6171.4400000000005
work available to me out there with my

6169.84 --> 6173.119000000001
skill set

6171.44 --> 6175.28
sales

6173.119 --> 6178.639
what do you do with sales

6175.28 --> 6181.119
blabber on indoctrinate people

6178.639 --> 6182.32
and make them wanna buy [ __ ] they don't

6181.119 --> 6185.839999999999
need

6182.32 --> 6185.84
which means lying

6186.32 --> 6192.719
maybe you now understand

6188.639 --> 6195.92
why i'm on social welfare

6192.719 --> 6198.4800000000005
and i don't really have a job

6195.92 --> 6200.32
because it just doesn't work i mean i

6198.48 --> 6201.638999999999
tried like

6200.32 --> 6204.5599999999995
selling

6201.639 --> 6206.719
newspapers roughly it's what it was in a

6204.56 --> 6210.320000000001
call center

6206.719 --> 6213.44
and that's like kind of harmless right

6210.32 --> 6215.119
but it's still like they i literally had

6213.44 --> 6216.799999999999
the bosses

6215.119 --> 6219.599999999999
tell me

6216.8 --> 6220.4800000000005
you gotta sell more and i told them

6219.6 --> 6223.84
but

6220.48 --> 6226.08
i would be lying i'm trying to like make

6223.84 --> 6227.679
them feel good

6226.08 --> 6230.0
about us

6227.679 --> 6232.2390000000005
so they have a natural loyalty and will

6230.0 --> 6233.36
be more willing in the future to

6232.239 --> 6235.119
actually

6233.36 --> 6237.04
be like yeah i like this guy i'm going

6235.119 --> 6238.96
to take it maybe i don't even care that

6237.04 --> 6241.6
much about the newspaper but i like

6238.96 --> 6244.56
these guys yeah customer binding they

6241.6 --> 6247.119000000001
said no no no no

6244.56 --> 6250.159000000001
you have to be quicker you got to force

6247.119 --> 6250.159
it down their throat

6250.48 --> 6253.839999999999
and when i said

6251.92 --> 6255.28
i can do that

6253.84 --> 6257.679
guess what happened at the end of the

6255.28 --> 6261.8
month yeah

6257.679 --> 6261.8
we're gonna have to let you go

6262.56 --> 6269.1990000000005
and that's the last official job i had

6266.96 --> 6272.4800000000005
besides my newspaper rounds which are by

6269.199 --> 6274.239
the way canceled since may so

6272.48 --> 6277.239
it doesn't exist the job doesn't exist

6274.239 --> 6277.239
anymore

6300.0 --> 6302.56
right

6300.88 --> 6305.04
the call center

6302.56 --> 6308.400000000001
supervisor literally

6305.04 --> 6311.5199999999995
demanded that i manipulate the people

6308.4 --> 6314.839999999999
that i had on the phone to more quickly

6311.52 --> 6314.84
take it

6316.08 --> 6322.88
they rejected

6318.239 --> 6325.119
my long-term customer binding strategy

6322.88 --> 6328.400000000001
and i was like

6325.119 --> 6329.28
what is this place

6328.4 --> 6332.719
like

6329.28 --> 6334.96
this is not even a company

6332.719 --> 6337.84
like this is just a

6334.96 --> 6337.84
operation

6338.0 --> 6341.76
like

6339.04 --> 6344.639
they're not even trying to get customer

6341.76 --> 6347.6
binding what kind of a place is that

6344.639 --> 6347.6
this is insane

6347.92 --> 6352.0
i afterward kind of thought like yeah

6350.159 --> 6353.44
this entire

6352.0 --> 6355.76
profession

6353.44 --> 6361.199
should just be

6355.76 --> 6361.1990000000005
taken out of existence it's parasitical

6363.28 --> 6370.679
it shouldn't exist these jobs should not

6366.56 --> 6370.679
exist they are parasitical

6384.96 --> 6388.88
but anyway that's

6386.56 --> 6391.88
years ago now

6388.88 --> 6391.88
right

6409.679 --> 6414.76
anything worth it should sell itself

6411.52 --> 6414.76
that's right

6420.88 --> 6425.119
anti-fla anti-flat earthers would be

6422.88 --> 6429.32
good at sales yes they would they

6425.119 --> 6429.32
probably are a lot of them

6430.48 --> 6435.28
on the other hand

6433.119 --> 6436.96
the amount like there's another thing

6435.28 --> 6439.84
though right

6436.96 --> 6442.32
a real good salesman has to actually be

6439.84 --> 6443.92
interested in what people are interested

6442.32 --> 6446.88
in

6443.92 --> 6449.04
a lot of these anti-flat earthers are so

6446.88 --> 6449.92
into their own little word

6449.04 --> 6451.679
world

6449.92 --> 6455.04
and their own little piece of

6451.679 --> 6457.679
their own cut of the information

6455.04 --> 6460.0
that they're not very empathetical

6457.679 --> 6461.76
so yeah they can lie their way through a

6460.0 --> 6464.239
situation

6461.76 --> 6466.400000000001
but you also have to like get into the

6464.239 --> 6468.5599999999995
other person's head that you're selling

6466.4 --> 6469.92
it to in order to make them interested

6468.56 --> 6471.76
that might be a little bit more

6469.92 --> 6473.6
difficult for the average baller

6471.76 --> 6475.679
anti-flat earther

6473.6 --> 6479.119000000001
because they don't really have m they're

6475.679 --> 6481.36
so stuck into their own world

6479.119 --> 6484.48
that

6481.36 --> 6488.159
they have more trouble

6484.48 --> 6488.159
figuring out who's in front of them

6489.119 --> 6493.119
they're more inclined to use

6491.04 --> 6495.28
standard

6493.119 --> 6497.36
tactical peer pressure which is

6495.28 --> 6500.96
something that i

6497.36 --> 6503.679
would never do and i don't need it ever

6500.96 --> 6506.8
i just immediately try to size up who am

6503.679 --> 6509.04
i talking to who am i engaging with

6506.8 --> 6510.639
what do they want

6509.04 --> 6513.04
and what do they really want what do

6510.639 --> 6515.84
they want that they're not comfortable

6513.04 --> 6519.04
even sharing

6515.84 --> 6520.2390000000005
and how do i make them understand that i

6519.04 --> 6522.4
understand

6520.239 --> 6524.839999999999
what they're not comfortable sharing and

6522.4 --> 6526.48
can still help them to it

6524.84 --> 6530.159000000001
without

6526.48 --> 6530.159
throwing it out on the table

6532.0 --> 6537.679
that's something anti-flat earthers are

6534.48 --> 6540.799999999999
not good at not even close

6537.679 --> 6543.4400000000005
because they they can't they don't have

6540.8 --> 6545.4400000000005
the dynamics they're all

6543.44 --> 6547.919999999999
rigided up

6545.44 --> 6550.719
through their ball machinations they're

6547.92 --> 6553.92
all set

6550.719 --> 6557.44
they don't have the dynam the the

6553.92 --> 6557.4400000000005
the dynamic nature

6565.199 --> 6570.5599999999995
a doors

6566.4 --> 6570.5599999999995
a door-to-door door salesman

6580.88 --> 6583.84
okay

6593.36 --> 6596.96
psychopathic i don't know if that's

6595.04 --> 6598.96
psychopathic it's more sociopathic

6596.96 --> 6603.52
traits

6598.96 --> 6607.119
i mean psychopaths can actually be

6603.52 --> 6609.280000000001
very good at convincing people

6607.119 --> 6613.598999999999
they have absolutely no empathy but they

6609.28 --> 6613.599
are actually really good manipulators

6613.92 --> 6616.96
these people are not

6623.04 --> 6627.28
you do realize that right ben white

6625.44 --> 6629.678999999999
a lot of psychopaths

6627.28 --> 6632.8
really good and manipulation

6629.679 --> 6633.76
because instead of living with a feeling

6632.8 --> 6636.08
life

6633.76 --> 6638.639
they've spent their entire life trying

6636.08 --> 6641.28
to figure out how to manipulate people

6638.639 --> 6643.84
because they don't have any consequences

6641.28 --> 6646.719
from feelings it's an external thing

6643.84 --> 6650.52
that they learn to play

6646.719 --> 6650.52
and they act perfectly

6652.719 --> 6657.92
so yeah psychopaths actually do make

6655.119 --> 6657.92
great salesmen

6658.48 --> 6662.959999999999
so i would rather classify those traits

6660.96 --> 6664.96
as sociopathic

6662.96 --> 6667.84
like egotistical

6664.96 --> 6667.84
not dynamic

6668.32 --> 6672.5599999999995
anyway

6669.36 --> 6672.5599999999995
that's just nitpicking

6673.599 --> 6676.599
uh

6682.159 --> 6687.199
here's johnny you needed

6684.32 --> 6689.36
okay i get it that's hilarious

6687.199 --> 6691.598999999999
so basically like a maniac with an axe

6689.36 --> 6693.36
start bashing in the door

6691.599 --> 6696.32
and then like

6693.36 --> 6698.5599999999995
like somebody inside ah

6696.32 --> 6700.5599999999995
the police is coming soon i said ma'am

6698.56 --> 6703.119000000001
ma'am

6700.56 --> 6705.92
i got doors for sale

6703.119 --> 6708.799999999999
i got the latest model just

6705.92 --> 6709.84
pushing the door like through the hole

6708.8 --> 6712.0
you just

6709.84 --> 6712.719
cut down with the axe

6712.0 --> 6713.84
like

6712.719 --> 6716.2390000000005
hello

6713.84 --> 6718.56
i got a really great door i want to sell

6716.239 --> 6721.36
you it looks like you need one since i

6718.56 --> 6722.96
just made a hole in it

6721.36 --> 6726.679
sorry this is

6722.96 --> 6726.679
really silly imagery

6740.32 --> 6744.119
yeah thank you for that

6758.719 --> 6764.4
but what could be hilarious by the way

6762.239 --> 6766.4
this this is ridiculous that i'm even

6764.4 --> 6768.799999999999
going there but

6766.4 --> 6772.799999999999
like you do like

6768.8 --> 6772.8
you could be like a door salesman

6773.04 --> 6776.639
and then keeping track of like police

6775.119 --> 6778.88
activity

6776.639 --> 6780.0
and then if a house is going to be swat

6778.88 --> 6781.84
teamed

6780.0 --> 6784.88
right you know what they do they always

6781.84 --> 6787.360000000001
bash open the door and [ __ ]

6784.88 --> 6790.0
well then you could afterward

6787.36 --> 6792.719
if anybody's still left there

6790.0 --> 6795.28
afterwards just be like yeah you need a

6792.719 --> 6795.28
new door

6795.36 --> 6799.759999999999
you could swat rate it you're probably

6797.36 --> 6801.36
going to need a new door

6799.76 --> 6806.360000000001
this is crazy

6801.36 --> 6806.36
how i come up with this [ __ ] but yeah

6817.199 --> 6821.36
like hey oh sir i just heard you got

6819.84 --> 6824.08
swat rated

6821.36 --> 6827.08
i'm a door salesman

6824.08 --> 6827.08
right

6834.56 --> 6839.92
we also remove blood stains

6837.679 --> 6842.159
drug red no no no but that's

6839.92 --> 6844.32
it's afterward maybe the blood stains

6842.159 --> 6844.32
but

6845.44 --> 6851.839999999999
we're not gonna get involved in like

6848.239 --> 6851.839999999999
covering criminal activity

6852.8 --> 6857.679
if i were that type of door salesman i'd

6855.119 --> 6861.199
just be selling doors maybe double as

6857.679 --> 6861.1990000000005
like cleaning service

6861.599 --> 6867.599
new business model it sounds really i

6864.88 --> 6868.88
don't know man it sounds very like

6867.599 --> 6871.76
brazil

6868.88 --> 6873.599
right the movie brazil

6871.76 --> 6875.76
it would be like a corporation in the

6873.599 --> 6879.1990000000005
movie brazil right because they swat

6875.76 --> 6881.1990000000005
team like the [ __ ] out of place although

6879.199 --> 6883.839999999999
that would be like hello sir you need a

6881.199 --> 6886.719
new floor yeah they just literally cut a

6883.84 --> 6889.52
hole in your ceiling

6886.719 --> 6890.8
while swat raiding you

6889.52 --> 6893.76
but yeah

6890.8 --> 6897.320000000001
it sounds very like a business in the in

6893.76 --> 6897.320000000001
the movie brazil

6918.08 --> 6921.199
police

6918.96 --> 6924.4800000000005
refused to pay for the broken yeah i

6921.199 --> 6924.48
know it sucks

6924.96 --> 6930.2390000000005
i know it sucks

6927.52 --> 6932.400000000001
like swat raids really suck

6930.239 --> 6937.04
especially when they just go by bad

6932.4 --> 6937.04
information it's really a nuisance

6937.52 --> 6944.080000000001
it even gets people or like pets killed

6941.119 --> 6946.96
for no damn reason

6944.08 --> 6949.36
like a lot of like dogs just get shot

6946.96 --> 6951.36
from freaking swat rates when they're

6949.36 --> 6954.639
raiding the wrong house

6951.36 --> 6954.639
it's really [ __ ] up

6957.52 --> 6960.52
anyway

6966.48 --> 6970.48
door salesman at that time would have

6968.239 --> 6973.48
been appropriate

6970.48 --> 6973.48
right

6989.92 --> 6993.1990000000005
all right also by the way

6993.28 --> 6996.4
paramedic service
