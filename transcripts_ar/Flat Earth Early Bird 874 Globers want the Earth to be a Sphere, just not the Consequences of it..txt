sun there's still

90.64 --> 94.4
some blue bits

97.28 --> 101.68
like it really remained very clouded

99.52 --> 105.119
yesterday

101.68 --> 106.47900000000001
pretty much up until late yeah up until

105.119 --> 109.759
the night

106.479 --> 112.96
and it cleared up a little

109.759 --> 112.96
bright moon out there

113.52 --> 118.479
but yeah it's not super warm although

116.64 --> 120.07900000000001
it's not really cold it's just that yeah

118.479 --> 122.24
with the wind blowing

120.079 --> 125.19999999999999
it does get a bit cold but anyway yeah

122.24 --> 128.319
look at the trees down there

125.2 --> 130.08
they're like almost fully in bloom or

128.319 --> 131.51999999999998
yeah they are pretty much fully in bloom

130.08 --> 134.959
i think

131.52 --> 140.959
so that's kind of pretty

134.959 --> 140.959
to behold one over there as well

141.28 --> 146.16
and yeah

152.239 --> 161.519
all right so it's sunday the 25th

157.28 --> 161.519
of april 2021.

162.08 --> 165.28
uh i'm gonna

165.68 --> 170.08
an hour show at least maybe two hours it

168.08 --> 172.4
depends if things are gonna turn

170.08 --> 173.20000000000002
out just like it did yesterday then i

172.4 --> 176.0
might

173.2 --> 177.28
it all depends how many people are gonna

176.0 --> 180.4
be there in chat

177.28 --> 184.56
it's really a active vibrant chat

180.4 --> 187.20000000000002
that keeps me going literally

184.56 --> 188.959
right and yesterday show was great and

187.2 --> 191.11999999999998
it was kind of funny because when i

188.959 --> 194.4
started it up i really did not feel good

191.12 --> 195.68
at all but then yeah during the show

194.4 --> 198.4
that kind of

195.68 --> 199.20000000000002
transformed and the rest of the day was

198.4 --> 202.64000000000001
great

199.2 --> 204.56
a great day there was a ball buster's

202.64 --> 207.92
life

204.56 --> 208.879
that was able to make a couple of good

207.92 --> 212.23899999999998
points haas

208.879 --> 214.48
i sang this is

212.239 --> 217.36
sang the black hole swan song couple of

214.48 --> 221.84
times that was a lot of fun

217.36 --> 221.84
ah hello james mason first in chat

222.799 --> 227.84
right been watching some movies

225.36 --> 227.84
yesterday

228.48 --> 234.48
on netflix right

231.76 --> 235.04
watch an older one it's been a long time

234.48 --> 238.319
and it's

235.04 --> 240.56
it's good to see it again like the movie

238.319 --> 243.51899999999998
clear and present danger

240.56 --> 244.239
harrison ford and so like spy stuff with

243.519 --> 248.0
government it's

244.239 --> 249.439
really interesting now like when i first

248.0 --> 252.799
watched that movie

249.439 --> 254.72
i was like what what's going on uh

252.799 --> 256.88
didn't really get it when it was much

254.72 --> 259.44
younger now

256.88 --> 260.959
like there is so much detail in that

259.44 --> 264.479
movie

260.959 --> 267.199
that's really thought out well that yeah

264.479 --> 269.52
now i really appreciate that movie

267.199 --> 272.8
although yeah it ends very typical oh

269.52 --> 274.639
like the secret service is gonna break

272.8 --> 277.12
open the scandal

274.639 --> 277.12
like that

277.84 --> 282.88
it's just interesting to watch it again

279.759 --> 285.12
it's a pretty good movie a long movie

282.88 --> 286.24
that's pretty good right uh yeah ball

285.12 --> 287.68
busters then

286.24 --> 289.759
because i did watch the movie like in

287.68 --> 294.24
the afternoon

289.759 --> 297.6
uh then martin litke went live

294.24 --> 300.08
also watched a big chunk of that

297.6 --> 301.36
got a little silly at some point just

300.08 --> 303.52
weird

301.36 --> 306.72
does that every now and just weird gift

303.52 --> 308.79999999999995
library which is goofy stuff

306.72 --> 310.16
but it's always fun martin luther

308.8 --> 313.44
flatter day night

310.16 --> 315.759
streams uh

313.44 --> 315.759
then

317.36 --> 322.32
later kind of ended up the day with a

320.8 --> 324.40000000000003
movie that kind of

322.32 --> 326.71999999999997
came suggested to me and i'd never seen

324.4 --> 329.19899999999996
it before and so i thought like okay

326.72 --> 330.08000000000004
let's just take a look at this it was

329.199 --> 334.08000000000004
like

330.08 --> 337.28
godzilla too king of monsters

334.08 --> 339.19899999999996
and it's funny because i remember having

337.28 --> 342.55999999999995
seen a movie reviewer

339.199 --> 346.56
review it before and

342.56 --> 347.919
yeah i thought i had mixed feelings

346.56 --> 351.919
about this movie it was

347.919 --> 355.039
actually the cgi was just

351.919 --> 358.4
amazing cgi sound effects were

355.039 --> 359.199
absolutely like one of the best i've

358.4 --> 362.31899999999996
ever seen

359.199 --> 365.28000000000003
with like giant monster movies

362.319 --> 366.96000000000004
it was really impressive really really

365.28 --> 370.4
impressive

366.96 --> 372.71999999999997
and definitely made by fans

370.4 --> 375.039
of the concept like it wasn't just some

372.72 --> 378.47900000000004
stupid cassian movie

375.039 --> 382.0
were some weird sort of like eugenicist

378.479 --> 385.52
themes running through it as well

382.0 --> 387.84
and like the the couple

385.52 --> 389.039
that was pretty much at the center of

387.84 --> 392.479
the movie

389.039 --> 395.84
were just unnatural it was weird

392.479 --> 400.56
that part i was like what serious

395.84 --> 404.0
ugh but yeah the monster parts

400.56 --> 407.039
really awesome also one of my favorite

404.0 --> 410.0
actors was in that movie like my my

407.039 --> 413.12
favorite villain of all times

410.0 --> 415.28
uh he also played like the

413.12 --> 416.72
the general in game of thrones i forget

415.28 --> 419.28
his name he's awesome

416.72 --> 421.03900000000004
like everywhere he's in he's always

419.28 --> 422.55999999999995
awesome doesn't really matter what type

421.039 --> 427.44
of move it even is

422.56 --> 427.44
comedy action is always awesome

429.28 --> 433.35999999999996
right but it it did indeed moth eyes

432.8 --> 436.0
feel

433.36 --> 438.24
like a bit of an analogy with the great

436.0 --> 441.68
reason it was this theme like oh

438.24 --> 445.199
and they were constantly like inserting

441.68 --> 449.199
like titan worship and [ __ ] in there

445.199 --> 449.199
that was like eh

449.68 --> 453.599
i guess if this [ __ ] was really

452.479 --> 457.12
happening

453.599 --> 460.15999999999997
yeah it just feels like

457.12 --> 462.0
you know felt like

460.16 --> 464.47900000000004
oh yeah yeah i know what you're trying

462.0 --> 467.36
to do i know what you're trying to do

464.479 --> 468.08
like okay in the movie world yeah yeah

467.36 --> 471.36
yeah

468.08 --> 473.28
but at the same time indeed what's

471.36 --> 476.8
really happening in the real world

473.28 --> 479.52
gives yeah watching that being told a

476.8 --> 483.52000000000004
little bit of a bitter aftertaste

479.52 --> 486.08
i agree with that but overall especially

483.52 --> 489.19899999999996
this the cgi parts were just like

486.08 --> 489.75899999999996
really really gorgeous so beautiful

489.199 --> 492.8
actually

489.759 --> 494.08000000000004
so well done that i'd probably watch

492.8 --> 496.879
this movie again

494.08 --> 497.84
just to see it again to just how they

496.879 --> 500.319
did that

497.84 --> 503.11999999999995
so many monsters and they put so much

500.319 --> 503.12
effort into it

505.12 --> 508.56
also like started to notice like at the

508.16 --> 512.76
end

508.56 --> 516.159
that it had almost like a bit of a

512.76 --> 519.4399999999999
transformers feeling right like

516.159 --> 522.479
the autobots and the decepticons like

519.44 --> 524.8800000000001
the good titans and the

522.479 --> 526.64
evil titans and there was this whole

524.88 --> 529.68
mythology

526.64 --> 529.68
inserted also

530.16 --> 535.04
about how the the big black dragon that

533.44 --> 537.7600000000001
wasn't supposed to be

535.04 --> 539.76
in against the natural or it was just

537.76 --> 541.2
all this weird mythology [ __ ] that they

539.76 --> 544.88
did with it

541.2 --> 547.519
and yeah it was decent

544.88 --> 549.4399999999999
but yeah a bit of a weird aftertaste of

547.519 --> 551.6
course in reflection to what's

549.44 --> 553.6
in there happening in the real world but

551.6 --> 554.64
it was funny because it also reminded me

553.6 --> 558.48
of like

554.64 --> 560.0
the dragon mountain range right

558.48 --> 562.32
where that has been kind of going around

560.0 --> 565.36
in conspiracy land

562.32 --> 568.1600000000001
conspiracy video land like they did

565.36 --> 569.6
kind of lend from that as well and

568.16 --> 572.399
that's also like

569.6 --> 574.08
like the monsters literally rose out of

572.399 --> 575.92
the mountains like they were the

574.08 --> 577.6
mountains and like the crust come off

575.92 --> 582.7199999999999
and they rose out

577.6 --> 586.0
that was just in well done interesting

582.72 --> 589.279
thought was put into that and yeah so i

586.0 --> 592.88
i liked it despite yeah wasn't perfect

589.279 --> 596.56
didn't really like all the characters

592.88 --> 604.24
but yeah it was pretty

596.56 --> 606.7199999999999
worth watching anyway

604.24 --> 610.32
moth eyes seeking star water neil

606.72 --> 613.44
cosentino good to see you

610.32 --> 617.839
drove around flat head lake

613.44 --> 620.9590000000001
what i wish i had a p900

617.839 --> 626.0790000000001
70 miles long and so flat all right

620.959 --> 626.079
is that really cold flat hat lake weird

630.8 --> 633.8389999999999
all right

634.64 --> 641.92
crazy morning today neil is it

638.959 --> 643.04
all right anyway i got green tea and i

641.92 --> 645.68
also got

643.04 --> 646.88
some turmeric coffee it went really well

645.68 --> 649.76
yesterday so i

646.88 --> 649.76
thought i'd do it again

656.8 --> 660.079
right oh yeah yeah i did i did manage to

659.6 --> 663.839
actually

660.079 --> 665.5999999999999
contact martin litka over skype

663.839 --> 669.6800000000001
and i told him like hey let's do a

665.6 --> 669.6800000000001
hangout again and basically talk about

670.0 --> 673.279
like well therefore what happened since

672.72 --> 675.36
our

673.279 --> 678.64
first hangout my first hangout on my

675.36 --> 678.64
channel which was with him

678.8 --> 684.56
i thought like first one was with him

680.88 --> 687.4399999999999
the second one was with robert shortman

684.56 --> 688.56
it was a long time ago by now so and he

687.44 --> 692.6400000000001
seemed to agree

688.56 --> 693.5189999999999
but i guess i'll just have to like kind

692.64 --> 695.4399999999999
of

693.519 --> 697.12
yeah in the moment hook him and then

695.44 --> 699.36
just quickly get him on anyway

697.12 --> 701.279
also i'm gonna get some help if

699.36 --> 704.9590000000001
everything goes all right

701.279 --> 708.0
from adam meekin

704.959 --> 709.279
fixing the skype sound situation because

708.0 --> 712.24
yeah neil came on

709.279 --> 714.32
was it yesterday or the day before and

712.24 --> 716.32
like the sounds bit of a problem

714.32 --> 719.44
because it basically is coming through

716.32 --> 721.44
my speakers which is kind of ridiculous

719.44 --> 723.36
to like my microphone picks it up

721.44 --> 724.399
through my speakers it's not a really

723.36 --> 727.279
good setup

724.399 --> 729.44
so if i fix that then i'll have guests

727.279 --> 731.36
on and it'll sound better

729.44 --> 732.48
it's kind of important if i want to have

731.36 --> 735.2
more gas on

732.48 --> 738.0790000000001
so hopefully that will be fixed

735.2 --> 738.0790000000001
somewhere today

741.2 --> 746.5600000000001
hello here we go again when the show

744.8 --> 747.76
so good to see you let's go and getting

746.56 --> 748.6389999999999
along with the roommates it's still

747.76 --> 753.68
after you

748.639 --> 758.639
dude they they're not really after me

753.68 --> 761.68
not really they're just

758.639 --> 763.44
cocked to my landlord

761.68 --> 767.279
they don't want to get involved they're

763.44 --> 770.72
just diplo typical

767.279 --> 770.72
like they don't want to make a stand

770.839 --> 775.36
right

772.079 --> 779.1999999999999
yes yeah and they know the guy

775.36 --> 782.48
that's doing this out there he's

779.2 --> 785.519
he is just messed up and he

782.48 --> 791.04
is not shy to abuse power

785.519 --> 791.04
at all and they kind of feel it i guess

791.12 --> 795.04
so yeah i'm just going to have to sit

793.36 --> 797.279
through it and hope

795.04 --> 799.12
that the justice system is going to make

797.279 --> 802.56
sense because overall and i've

799.12 --> 806.0
cross-referenced this many times

802.56 --> 809.2399999999999
in the netherlands to actually get

806.0 --> 812.839
kicked out of your house you have to

809.24 --> 816.0790000000001
really really get

812.839 --> 819.519
extreme it's crazy

816.079 --> 821.5999999999999
it's also made me definitely consider

819.519 --> 822.399
that i'll probably never be a landlord

821.6 --> 825.1990000000001
because

822.399 --> 825.92
of just how messed up that can get like

825.199 --> 828.24
once you

825.92 --> 830.4799999999999
attract somebody in there that turns out

828.24 --> 832.639
to be a total maniac that actually

830.48 --> 835.36
vandalizes the place and literally

832.639 --> 838.16
harasses people

835.36 --> 839.1990000000001
that's yeah like you can't get rid of

838.16 --> 842.24
them so

839.199 --> 842.8
based on that i don't see any logical

842.24 --> 844.32
way

842.8 --> 848.4799999999999
that i would get kicked out of this

844.32 --> 852.0
house unless i was literally

848.48 --> 853.839
being made an example of like unjustly

852.0 --> 855.92
like they would approach me like oh with

853.839 --> 858.0
the social justice warrior attitude or

855.92 --> 859.76
something

858.0 --> 862.0
and then even then i don't think that

859.76 --> 864.959
would even matter it's like

862.0 --> 866.959
so the thing is though i'm still it

864.959 --> 869.4399999999999
still makes me sick it still makes me

866.959 --> 870.399
nervous i feel like my home could be

869.44 --> 872.32
taken from me

870.399 --> 872.62
right and it's very hard to get rid of

872.32 --> 873.7600000000001
that

872.62 --> 876.32
[Music]

873.76 --> 878.16
but technically it would make no sense

876.32 --> 881.9200000000001
if i would get kicked out

878.16 --> 885.36
but what it could do is kind of like

881.92 --> 888.639
put out just bad vibes

885.36 --> 892.32
about me out there and that's also what

888.639 --> 892.32
i'm a bit nervous of but then again

892.56 --> 899.8389999999999
i just shouldn't really worry even if my

894.959 --> 899.8389999999999
roommates are too afraid to get involved

902.48 --> 908.8000000000001
so i'm just

905.6 --> 913.36
letting it all be whatever it is also

908.8 --> 917.5999999999999
by the way there's like a new girl

913.36 --> 919.519
coming in in june to replace this one

917.6 --> 921.279
that i can't really get along with all

919.519 --> 924.079
too well

921.279 --> 925.04
and yeah she seems like an act an actual

924.079 --> 928.4799999999999
woman

925.04 --> 928.48
right a real woman and

928.959 --> 936.56
i kind of liked her she was

932.88 --> 940.16
like yeah there's questions i will be

936.56 --> 942.3199999999999
asking like did you get the vaccine

940.16 --> 944.16
are you gonna get it what do you think

942.32 --> 946.0790000000001
about that that's going to determine

944.16 --> 948.56
whether i'm going to

946.079 --> 949.3599999999999
yeah maybe actually really get to know

948.56 --> 950.88
her

949.36 --> 952.8000000000001
or whether i'm going to have to treat

950.88 --> 956.079
her like an npc like

952.8 --> 960.639
almost everybody else here

956.079 --> 962.8
but yeah who knows she at least she

960.639 --> 966.639
seemed like a very nice person that's

962.8 --> 970.56
actually a woman and that has like

966.639 --> 973.199
not no deranged

970.56 --> 975.68
spirit or anything so that was kind of

973.199 --> 975.68
promising

977.199 --> 980.4799999999999
it would be really good to just get to

979.36 --> 983.519
know woman

980.48 --> 986.72
in the house that might be able to

983.519 --> 989.04
actually appreciate my character but she

986.72 --> 994.0
looked like she had the depth

989.04 --> 994.0
for it so that was promising

994.839 --> 1001.6
uh

996.959 --> 1004.2399999999999
all right so anyway that's kind of it

1001.6 --> 1005.36
i did go to bed a bit late i tried not

1004.24 --> 1012.24
to

1005.36 --> 1012.24
it was just so much activity oh

1012.639 --> 1018.5600000000001
and i kind of wanted to finish the

1014.639 --> 1018.5600000000001
godzilla movie it did take a bit long

1023.12 --> 1026.88
flat smack her and you'll find it if she

1025.199 --> 1029.919
really all right away

1026.88 --> 1033.0390000000002
well i'm no i don't that's ridic

1029.919 --> 1037.039
dude rufus

1033.039 --> 1040.319
you don't do that when they just

1037.039 --> 1043.6
get in right

1040.319 --> 1046.6399999999999
look if she's going to ask me

1043.6 --> 1050.3999999999999
i'll tell her i'm not going to flat

1046.64 --> 1052.0
smack her unless she gives a sign that

1050.4 --> 1054.24
she actually

1052.0 --> 1056.32
knows anything about it look if she's

1054.24 --> 1058.0
like totally afraid of anything

1056.32 --> 1060.08
conspiracy theory

1058.0 --> 1061.76
yeah she's living here and then i'm

1060.08 --> 1062.559
gonna flat smack her i don't want to do

1061.76 --> 1065.039
that to her

1062.559 --> 1065.039
right that

1065.6 --> 1072.24
like the guy downstairs then

1068.88 --> 1073.5200000000002
the latest roommate like he couldn't do

1072.24 --> 1078.799
anything with it either

1073.52 --> 1078.799
like nothing he seemed like fine with it

1079.039 --> 1085.12
like oh sure that's your thing okay

1082.24 --> 1085.44
but he doesn't know what to do with it

1085.12 --> 1088.559
he

1085.44 --> 1089.679
he can't even resist basic corona

1088.559 --> 1092.08
propaganda

1089.679 --> 1092.96
like at all so yeah there's nothing i

1092.08 --> 1095.84
can do with that

1092.96 --> 1095.8400000000001
at all

1096.72 --> 1102.96
just nothing i'm gonna just leave him to

1100.0 --> 1106.32
his devices he's just gonna have to

1102.96 --> 1108.799
figure it out for himself

1106.32 --> 1109.84
you know he has been warned literally

1108.799 --> 1115.039
told him like

1109.84 --> 1115.039
remember the story god giving warnings

1115.2 --> 1121.679
if you don't take it then

1118.32 --> 1123.6789999999999
yeah he warned you so i told him that

1121.679 --> 1125.8400000000001
if he's not gonna do it that's his

1123.679 --> 1128.3200000000002
freaking problem

1125.84 --> 1129.1999999999998
literally like if he's going to

1128.32 --> 1131.84
personally

1129.2 --> 1133.52
feel suffering for that afterward that's

1131.84 --> 1135.6
literally his problem

1133.52 --> 1137.84
i'm not even gonna sympathize with that

1135.6 --> 1137.84
right

1137.919 --> 1141.5200000000002
nobody should do that just like when i

1140.4 --> 1144.48
was younger and

1141.52 --> 1145.2
really stupid stubborn as i said

1144.48 --> 1148.32
yesterday

1145.2 --> 1150.4
explained like i hate how i was i hated

1148.32 --> 1153.36
that it worked that way

1150.4 --> 1154.96
but yeah when you then somebody gives

1153.36 --> 1157.1999999999998
you advice

1154.96 --> 1158.48
and you're not and you're not you don't

1157.2 --> 1161.2
show any humility

1158.48 --> 1162.799
you're like no no no you're wrong yeah

1161.2 --> 1166.48
then you don't deserve

1162.799 --> 1168.72
any sympathy you don't you don't deserve

1166.48 --> 1170.48
sympathy from people that are trying to

1168.72 --> 1171.76
wake you when you then tell them no

1170.48 --> 1174.24
you're wrong

1171.76 --> 1176.08
don't deserve it right if you then wake

1174.24 --> 1178.32
up later

1176.08 --> 1179.9189999999999
it's just that's good but these people

1178.32 --> 1180.48
are not going to give you any sympathy

1179.919 --> 1184.5590000000002
because

1180.48 --> 1185.76
you didn't show humility now i have had

1184.559 --> 1189.76
moments like with

1185.76 --> 1192.0
christians where i was kind of like

1189.76 --> 1193.52
inquiring figuring out christianity

1192.0 --> 1195.039
still believing in god

1193.52 --> 1196.799
even though that was kind of something

1195.039 --> 1198.559
that my friend circle didn't really want

1196.799 --> 1201.52
to talk about

1198.559 --> 1202.0
i was trying to figure it out and then

1201.52 --> 1204.6399999999999
had

1202.0 --> 1206.24
like bump-ins short conversations about

1204.64 --> 1207.679
it where i would say like i think this

1206.24 --> 1209.1200000000001
is wrong and that is wrong about the

1207.679 --> 1212.24
church

1209.12 --> 1214.799
and then they would give their own

1212.24 --> 1217.44
rollout like what is sin and what does

1214.799 --> 1219.6
it really mean and

1217.44 --> 1220.96
and then i would be shocked but i

1219.6 --> 1224.1589999999999
wouldn't like oh

1220.96 --> 1226.08
no you're stupid no i would just say i i

1224.159 --> 1227.6000000000001
i think i understand it's just something

1226.08 --> 1230.799
i can't deal with right now

1227.6 --> 1232.559
but i will i will right

1230.799 --> 1234.72
and when you do that when you show

1232.559 --> 1237.76
humility about something

1234.72 --> 1242.159
then you do deserve sympathy

1237.76 --> 1242.8799999999999
right i think that if i hadn't done that

1242.159 --> 1244.72
ever

1242.88 --> 1247.2
then i would have never gone to this

1244.72 --> 1249.2
church in my time of great need i would

1247.2 --> 1254.559
always be like oh no

1249.2 --> 1254.559
they're bad but i didn't do that

1256.0 --> 1268.88
when i was younger so yeah

1263.76 --> 1268.8799999999999
flat love tap her over some tea

1274.84 --> 1280.24
what

1277.039 --> 1282.64
now rufus dude you if you really think

1280.24 --> 1285.679
that that's a smart thing to do

1282.64 --> 1288.64
with roommates when your landlord is

1285.679 --> 1290.0
literally trying to slander and spread

1288.64 --> 1293.2800000000002
rumors to get you

1290.0 --> 1294.08
out at every cost right that's the

1293.28 --> 1299.6
dumbest

1294.08 --> 1299.6
[ __ ] thing you could ever do rufus

1300.24 --> 1305.44
right if random people on the street

1302.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
yeah sure it's somebody you're going to

1305.44 --> 1308.48
be

1305.84 --> 1310.08
right next to in a kind of tense

1308.48 --> 1319.76
situation it's the

1310.08 --> 1323.039
dumbest [ __ ] thing you could ever do

1319.76 --> 1333.84
paul kieran there is no curvature stop

1323.039 --> 1333.84
asserting your cult religion please

1344.559 --> 1350.8799999999999
yeah no [ __ ] rufus yeah he does

1347.679 --> 1354.3200000000002
he freaking sends emails to my dad

1350.88 --> 1356.5590000000002
and my social worker and every everybody

1354.32 --> 1360.24
he knows i'm associated with in some way

1356.559 --> 1363.12
he literally sends slander

1360.24 --> 1364.0
emails and text messages and written

1363.12 --> 1367.6789999999999
letters to

1364.0 --> 1369.679
everyone everyone who knows

1367.679 --> 1371.2
he knows is associated with me they've

1369.679 --> 1375.8400000000001
all told me

1371.2 --> 1375.8400000000001
yeah the guy is [ __ ] insane

1376.559 --> 1383.12
like stalker level insane

1380.24 --> 1383.679
he's like an obsessed psychopath like

1383.12 --> 1386.08
he's

1383.679 --> 1388.0
set his mind up no i am going to succeed

1386.08 --> 1389.4399999999998
kicking him out no matter the cost he

1388.0 --> 1391.2
is like that right now he's like a

1389.44 --> 1394.159
psychopath right

1391.2 --> 1395.76
and he's sparing no effort even though

1394.159 --> 1398.5590000000002
he's probably not gonna win

1395.76 --> 1399.919
so he set his strategy on literally

1398.559 --> 1402.8799999999999
trying to make my life

1399.919 --> 1403.919
so miserable that i'm just gonna go by

1402.88 --> 1408.72
my own volition

1403.919 --> 1412.5590000000002
that's his current tactic yeah

1408.72 --> 1416.24
yeah it's bad it is bad

1412.559 --> 1419.28
it's not just random oh a

1416.24 --> 1423.919
thing happened oh remotely no

1419.28 --> 1423.9189999999999
no literally really bad

1424.32 --> 1432.6399999999999
slanderous rumors being spread around

1428.48 --> 1434.0
like spam everywhere with everybody he

1432.64 --> 1444.39
knows associates

1434.0 --> 1447.419
she shows associates with me okay

1444.39 --> 1447.419
[Music]

1457.039 --> 1463.44
i wouldn't be surprised if he literally

1460.08 --> 1466.799
just asked roommates

1463.44 --> 1470.96
behind my back to basically

1466.799 --> 1474.72
rat out on me for benefits

1470.96 --> 1478.24
okay maybe even financial i would not

1474.72 --> 1480.64
be surprised one single bit if he was

1478.24 --> 1484.159
actually doing that

1480.64 --> 1486.88
okay it's that bad

1484.159 --> 1487.2
and i wonder if i can do anything about

1486.88 --> 1490.4
that

1487.2 --> 1493.6000000000001
because that all just seems extremely

1490.4 --> 1495.8400000000001
evil and illegal but i don't know if it

1493.6 --> 1495.84
is

1496.32 --> 1501.84
i don't think i'm in a position to do

1497.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
anything about it

1515.36 --> 1518.3999999999999
are you talking about

1519.679 --> 1523.6000000000001
right yeah it's tough so keep supporting

1523.279 --> 1526.72
me

1523.6 --> 1526.7199999999998
i really need it

1527.279 --> 1530.799
yeah it's kind of a cheap shot i know

1529.76 --> 1533.76
but i mean it

1530.799 --> 1535.6
it's really serious like i need the

1533.76 --> 1539.2
finances

1535.6 --> 1541.76
my costs have overall gone up

1539.2 --> 1544.96
i'm under pressure i i don't have any

1541.76 --> 1548.32
maneuvering room left

1544.96 --> 1549.1200000000001
right like after june if i'm still here

1548.32 --> 1553.36
and it

1549.12 --> 1556.799
should be then

1553.36 --> 1558.9599999999998
maybe yeah maybe like

1556.799 --> 1562.0
some of the pressure will be off because

1558.96 --> 1564.559
i get my vacation money from

1562.0 --> 1565.6
social welfare don't know why they have

1564.559 --> 1568.1589999999999
to do it like that

1565.6 --> 1569.76
but i get it in early june and then i

1568.159 --> 1572.24
can pay off

1569.76 --> 1574.08
probably most of the debts i have built

1572.24 --> 1577.279
up in the year

1574.08 --> 1580.0
but right now i am like

1577.279 --> 1580.0
pretty tight

1580.799 --> 1587.52
and yeah as you all know financial

1584.32 --> 1590.6399999999999
stress adds on greatly

1587.52 --> 1593.039
over on the overall situation so yeah

1590.64 --> 1594.3200000000002
you could literally just potentially

1593.039 --> 1599.84
save my life with that

1594.32 --> 1599.84
[ __ ] anyway

1606.48 --> 1612.32
thank you slo-mo moon buggy

1610.24 --> 1613.52

that's it

1642.32 --> 1646.399

2002.84 --> 2007.4399999999998
trolling he's playing with carrot on a

2006.72 --> 2010.799
stick

2007.44 --> 2014.88
with the ballers because he

2010.799 --> 2018.1589999999999

give him some excuse to kick me out

2191.92 --> 2196.7200000000003

2210.64 --> 2213.52
alone

2214.4 --> 2229.44
basic cooking herbs

2218.56 --> 2231.92

2331.66 --> 2339.919
[Music]

hmm

2394.839 --> 2397.839
do

2410.4 --> 2414.64
what's he gonna do but oh my god

2419.599 --> 2422.7200000000003
it's very simple what is he gonna do

2421.76 --> 2425.8390000000004
about it

2422.72 --> 2426.319
he's gonna put it on a list of look the

2425.839 --> 2429.44
guy

2426.319 --> 2430.079
is a borderline criminal or whatever

2429.44 --> 2432.4
he's a

2430.079 --> 2433.8390000000004
he is like a professional grower which

2432.4 --> 2435.6800000000003
means criminal because

2433.839 --> 2438.4
you're not allowed to really grow to

2435.68 --> 2442.0789999999997
sell right you're only allowed to grow

2438.4 --> 2445.6800000000003
for your own use it's like

2442.079 --> 2449.28
he could interpret it

2445.68 --> 2452.64
criminally and then put it on a pile

2449.28 --> 2455.76
to push me out he could he

2452.64 --> 2458.319
is not cool with anything

2455.76 --> 2459.3590000000004
i do do you understand anything he

2458.319 --> 2461.68
doesn't care

2459.359 --> 2463.2
anymore that i'm doing my best to behave

2461.68 --> 2467.359
well and to be a good

2463.2 --> 2470.0789999999997
person he doesn't care he is obsessed

2467.359 --> 2470.96
with getting me out of this house do you

2470.079 --> 2474.319
understand

2470.96 --> 2477.52
he will not accept anything

2474.319 --> 2482.56
so please no more of these really

2477.52 --> 2482.56
naive suggestions please stop it

2489.839 --> 2494.24
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter he's

2492.96 --> 2496.4
not gonna allow it

2494.24 --> 2499.2
as soon as he find out he's gonna put it

2496.4 --> 2499.2000000000003
on the list

2502.24 --> 2505.52
so i'm not gonna do that not as long as

2505.119 --> 2509.839
i

2505.52 --> 2509.839
live here not ever

2534.839 --> 2537.839
so

2538.64 --> 2542.56
especially if you pay your bill yeah i

2541.119 --> 2545.52
do pay my bills

2542.56 --> 2546.96
right and that's all of that combined is

2545.52 --> 2550.079
probably the reason

2546.96 --> 2553.52
why he can get me out i'm not gonna

2550.079 --> 2556.2400000000002
add to the pile do you understand

2553.52 --> 2557.52
i don't make a habit of like oh i'm in a

2556.24 --> 2560.8799999999997
risky situation

2557.52 --> 2562.64
who screw that let's put another risk

2560.88 --> 2565.04
factor on it that's such a

2562.64 --> 2566.64
smart way of going about yeah yeah

2565.04 --> 2569.92
that's because i'm not an

2566.64 --> 2572.16
idiot that seeks out danger

2569.92 --> 2573.119
when he doesn't need to yeah i'm not an

2572.16 --> 2575.5989999999997
idiot

2573.119 --> 2576.2400000000002
right you might be an idiot that would

2575.599 --> 2593.839
do that

2576.24 --> 2593.839
that's your [ __ ] problem i am not

2605.359 --> 2609.2
yeah shouldn't get away what am i gonna

2607.28 --> 2611.44
do about it

2609.2 --> 2613.4399999999996
i don't know what to do about it at all

2611.44 --> 2616.7200000000003
[Music]

2613.44 --> 2620.8
look if i could at

2616.72 --> 2624.24
some point somehow get my own lawyer

2620.8 --> 2627.28
and actually take him

2624.24 --> 2630.7999999999997
like take him down or something if

2627.28 --> 2630.8
what what would it lead to

2631.44 --> 2634.48
what would it even lead to i don't think

2633.68 --> 2637.5989999999997
it like

2634.48 --> 2639.68
it now i'm pretty sure

2637.599 --> 2641.52
i'm not the first person he's doing that

2639.68 --> 2643.68
[ __ ] with i'm probably the first one

2641.52 --> 2644.96
that's actually really tenaciously just

2643.68 --> 2648.64
not working along

2644.96 --> 2662.88
just like no i'm staying here for years

2648.64 --> 2663.2799999999997
and years and years you contact mark

2662.88 --> 2666.1600000000003
sargen

2663.28 --> 2668.88
no no didn't get to that yet but i did

2666.16 --> 2673.2799999999997
go to martin litka

2668.88 --> 2673.28
he was live yesterday and did contact

2674.839 --> 2677.839
him

2688.839 --> 2691.839
so

2701.359 --> 2705.839
[ __ ] off

2714.24 --> 2718.16
right but he shouldn't get away with

2715.839 --> 2719.68
that i don't know i don't know if i can

2718.16 --> 2724.0
do anything about it

2719.68 --> 2724.0
literally right

2724.56 --> 2732.319
like i don't know i don't think he i can

2729.359 --> 2733.2
like unless he like goes too far and

2732.319 --> 2736.24
literally

2733.2 --> 2739.52
tries to steal [ __ ] from me or

2736.24 --> 2742.8799999999997
break things that are mine

2739.52 --> 2744.8
or i don't know

2742.88 --> 2746.4
anything anything that's actually

2744.8 --> 2751.119
illegal no but he's just

2746.4 --> 2754.0
acting like a harassing manipulative

2751.119 --> 2754.8
rumor spreading stalker that's what he's

2754.0 --> 2757.04
doing

2754.8 --> 2758.4
and i don't know what i can do about it

2757.04 --> 2761.52
at all

2758.4 --> 2763.28
i don't know everybody that's getting

2761.52 --> 2766.48
harassed by him

2763.28 --> 2766.88
over me agrees they're all like yeah

2766.48 --> 2769.04
he's

2766.88 --> 2771.04
out of his mind he's completely

2769.04 --> 2774.88
anti-social

2771.04 --> 2778.079
and he's delusional he is delusional

2774.88 --> 2781.28
seriously delusional out of his mind

2778.079 --> 2784.0
delusional he makes up fantasy

2781.28 --> 2784.48
narratives about an evil person called

2784.0 --> 2787.599
me

2784.48 --> 2792.319
arwyn and then sticks

2787.599 --> 2792.319
to that story in his head for years

2792.88 --> 2796.8
right and when he approaches me he kind

2795.92 --> 2799.52
of

2796.8 --> 2801.52
tries to put me into that and i'm not

2799.52 --> 2804.64
working along with it i'm just like no

2801.52 --> 2808.16
i'm actually a really reasonable person

2804.64 --> 2808.16
that's honest even to you

2808.88 --> 2813.04
and he doesn't know what to do about it

2810.72 --> 2816.319
because i'm not playing along with his

2813.04 --> 2817.7599999999998
larping with his larping projections

2816.319 --> 2820.0
onto me

2817.76 --> 2821.44
i haven't i haven't done that and i'm

2820.0 --> 2823.52
not going to

2821.44 --> 2825.839
so then he's just stuck to his own

2823.52 --> 2830.64
delusions

2825.839 --> 2833.44
i don't know what to do about it

2830.64 --> 2836.64
i already offered him like hey you know

2833.44 --> 2839.68
i'm really trying to do my best here to

2836.64 --> 2842.319
get my past grievances

2839.68 --> 2844.64
my inner turmoil under control i have

2842.319 --> 2846.5589999999997
gotten it under control a lot better

2844.64 --> 2849.839
than i did years ago when i was

2846.559 --> 2852.1600000000003
really like getting like foaming at the

2849.839 --> 2854.48
mouth at times not towards people but

2852.16 --> 2857.92
still in general and it would like be

2854.48 --> 2859.839
shocking to just be in the vicinity

2857.92 --> 2861.359
hearing me even though i wasn't like

2859.839 --> 2864.48
doing that to people's face

2861.359 --> 2864.96
because i never ever do that to people's

2864.48 --> 2868.2400000000002
face

2864.96 --> 2870.839
ever ever right

2868.24 --> 2872.24
unless they literally threaten me

2870.839 --> 2875.839
physically

2872.24 --> 2880.24
or harass me physically

2875.839 --> 2880.24
never do that to anybody ever

2880.48 --> 2884.16
right but i got it much more under

2882.4 --> 2887.76
control and landlord

2884.16 --> 2890.8799999999997
just doesn't care he doesn't

2887.76 --> 2894.8
care he just is obsessed with

2890.88 --> 2896.7200000000003
no he's the powerful man he can decide

2894.8 --> 2898.88
that i will be kicked out

2896.72 --> 2900.5589999999997
and that's what he's sticking to like a

2898.88 --> 2903.6800000000003
psychopath

2900.559 --> 2904.2400000000002
and he doesn't care he just doesn't care

2903.68 --> 2915.839
about

2904.24 --> 2915.839
anything i say or do or anything

2919.839 --> 2929.839
security councils for what for what

2930.559 --> 2935.8390000000004
what the hell am i supposed to do with

2932.0 --> 2939.76
that and where am i gonna pay that

2935.839 --> 2942.88
why why would i have security cams

2939.76 --> 2945.599
it's ridiculous

2942.88 --> 2946.4
i don't need it on tape if he literally

2945.599 --> 2949.92
just

2946.4 --> 2953.599
steals or damages something that is mine

2949.92 --> 2957.76
then i can just report it to the police

2953.599 --> 2960.319
just like yeah he vandalized it

2957.76 --> 2960.8
he violated i just have to report it

2960.319 --> 2963.52
that's

2960.8 --> 2964.2400000000002
all that's only i don't need it on

2963.52 --> 2967.48
camera

2964.24 --> 2971.68
it's ridiculous and besides i got

2967.48 --> 2973.76
plenty of evidence of his abuse

2971.68 --> 2975.2
because he's literally sending written

2973.76 --> 2978.8
letters to everybody

2975.2 --> 2981.7599999999998
with his insane rambling about me okay

2978.8 --> 2982.6400000000003
literally i don't need a freaking camera

2981.76 --> 2985.92
he's not a

2982.64 --> 2988.48
secret stocky burglar

2985.92 --> 2998.16
he's a landlord and he's delusional and

2988.48 --> 3000.8
he thinks he's a king or something

2998.16 --> 3003.68
for my room and stuff no nobody's gonna

3000.8 --> 3003.6800000000003
get in my room

3004.16 --> 3008.319
they don't because i'm almost always

3006.64 --> 3010.8799999999997
here

3008.319 --> 3013.839
nobody's getting in this room they don't

3010.88 --> 3013.839
want to

3016.16 --> 3020.16
and they know like it might seem a

3019.28 --> 3024.559
little

3020.16 --> 3027.92
crowded here with stuff but they know

3024.559 --> 3031.0400000000004
i will notice any change anything

3027.92 --> 3041.839
immediately they all know this nobody's

3031.04 --> 3041.839
getting in my room

3052.839 --> 3058.16
hmm

3055.68 --> 3061.1189999999997
yeah rasta hat but you're in the

3058.16 --> 3063.2
freaking united states and california

3061.119 --> 3064.559
land of the zombies and criminally

3063.2 --> 3068.319
insane

3064.559 --> 3070.96
so yeah that's california this is the

3068.319 --> 3070.96
netherlands

3071.04 --> 3087.92
yeah there's barely any crime here

3083.04 --> 3087.92
serious barely it's

3094.839 --> 3097.839
rare

3100.48 --> 3103.94
[Music]

3108.839 --> 3111.839
ah

3117.359 --> 3124.16
much easier to prove on video what

3120.48 --> 3128.319
are you talking about

3124.16 --> 3131.359
he's literally written delusional

3128.319 --> 3134.079
letters with his name

3131.359 --> 3134.64
and everything on them to several

3134.079 --> 3139.76
different

3134.64 --> 3142.8799999999997
people almost copies of the same thing

3139.76 --> 3145.599
right what else evidence do i need

3142.88 --> 3146.4
i have the proof he is insane he is

3145.599 --> 3149.2000000000003
literally

3146.4 --> 3150.1600000000003
harassing people and trying to slander

3149.2 --> 3152.24
me

3150.16 --> 3154.48
to my own freaking dad and my social

3152.24 --> 3157.68
worker okay

3154.48 --> 3161.52
what else do i need i don't need

3157.68 --> 3165.839
anything else for crying out loud

3161.52 --> 3169.599
stop i don't need a [ __ ] security cam

3165.839 --> 3169.599
stop giving these stupid tips

3177.76 --> 3180.8
and the man rarely comes inside a house

3180.16 --> 3184.24
anyway

3180.8 --> 3194.38
like very very rarely very rarely

3184.24 --> 3196.9599999999996
maybe like once a year

3194.38 --> 3198.96
[Music]

3196.96 --> 3209.839
so yeah can we talk about something else

3198.96 --> 3209.839
now please

3242.88 --> 3251.839
right you tried

3246.96 --> 3251.839
yeah but i did respond

3252.0 --> 3257.76
ask eric to talk about the documentary

3255.52 --> 3257.7599999999998
well

3262.839 --> 3268.0
right

3264.64 --> 3270.48
i i think i will just try to contact him

3268.0 --> 3271.52
we'll see what he thinks of it but i

3270.48 --> 3273.44
don't know man

3271.52 --> 3275.44
as i said even yesterday i think there's

3273.44 --> 3276.88
a little chance he's actually going to

3275.44 --> 3280.799
respond to me

3276.88 --> 3280.799
he's never really responded to me

3282.799 --> 3287.7599999999998
because yeah even like before i did the

3285.52 --> 3291.28
flatter talks before i got onto the

3287.76 --> 3292.079
flat earth debate like i did kind of

3291.28 --> 3294.559
like hey

3292.079 --> 3297.119
eric the bay and he would just kind of

3294.559 --> 3297.119
troll me

3299.839 --> 3303.04
said that was a like control opposition

3302.559 --> 3306.7200000000003
shill

3303.04 --> 3309.52
and all that [ __ ]

3306.72 --> 3309.52
but who knows

3313.04 --> 3317.04
but yeah i think that i'm just first and

3315.76 --> 3320.48
foremost going to

3317.04 --> 3324.24
seek out the people that are at least

3320.48 --> 3324.88
not a freaking afraid to associate with

3324.24 --> 3327.68
me

3324.88 --> 3329.119
like for example martin luther who just

3327.68 --> 3332.0
is just like yeah

3329.119 --> 3333.839
yeah i know arwen from way back he's

3332.0 --> 3335.68
cool

3333.839 --> 3338.64
just doesn't give a [ __ ] about all this

3335.68 --> 3341.68
stupid nining that's going on out there

3338.64 --> 3343.1189999999997
with the flutter of debate against the

3341.68 --> 3347.9199999999996
others

3343.119 --> 3349.76
he doesn't give a [ __ ] about any of that

3347.92 --> 3354.96
he just doesn't really want to get

3349.76 --> 3354.96
in trouble but yeah

3355.76 --> 3360.48
so i might have him on at some point

3358.48 --> 3363.68
probably gonna do some

3360.48 --> 3367.52
late evening recording thing

3363.68 --> 3370.799
and then premiere it here on my channel

3367.52 --> 3374.4
maybe as a members only video

3370.799 --> 3374.4
it's been a while since i've done that

3375.44 --> 3379.52
try an olive branch but i never really

3377.76 --> 3383.5200000000004
did anything

3379.52 --> 3385.599
to him okay i called him a bit of a

3383.52 --> 3391.839
bit gay and all that but yeah come on

3385.599 --> 3391.839
the rumors are just making themselves

3393.44 --> 3399.76
content well yeah i can't talk about

3397.119 --> 3403.04
that i have an alternative history

3399.76 --> 3405.5200000000004
i set of ideas as myself

3403.04 --> 3419.839
we have even talked about that before

3405.52 --> 3419.839
martin and me

3420.799 --> 3425.52
that wouldn't be the first time i'd be

3423.119 --> 3428.559
accused of a shiel

3425.52 --> 3429.44
well actually no eric dubay was the very

3428.559 --> 3432.559
first person

3429.44 --> 3434.48
ever to accuse me of being a chill

3432.559 --> 3436.96
but he was doing that to a lot of people

3434.48 --> 3436.96
back then

3437.52 --> 3441.7599999999998
but especially after i started

3439.839 --> 3442.48
associating with patricia steer and

3441.76 --> 3446.3190000000004
having

3442.48 --> 3448.559
doing a couple of interviews with her

3446.319 --> 3449.44
she doing an interview with me yeah

3448.559 --> 3451.44
after that

3449.44 --> 3453.599
time is like oh he is one of the

3451.44 --> 3456.079
potatoes or one of the shields blah blah

3453.599 --> 3456.079
blah so

3458.839 --> 3461.839
whatever

3469.76 --> 3473.5200000000004
well here we go again expert is a big

3472.96 --> 3476.7200000000003
word

3473.52 --> 3480.0
but he has sifted through

3476.72 --> 3480.0
a lot of materials

3481.119 --> 3487.119
it's overall cohesion

3485.2 --> 3489.2
in the structures of everything he's

3487.119 --> 3491.44
seen is another matter he seems very

3489.2 --> 3494.16
fluid with this

3491.44 --> 3496.079
right and even during his shows i i tend

3494.16 --> 3499.359
to kind of point that out

3496.079 --> 3501.92
that he seems to kind of

3499.359 --> 3503.5989999999997
cohesion is not very high it's

3501.92 --> 3506.7200000000003
entertaining

3503.599 --> 3507.2000000000003
he does tintillate the thinking process

3506.72 --> 3510.9599999999996
about

3507.2 --> 3514.839
things but as to overarching

3510.96 --> 3518.16
ideas a lot of the times i'm like

3514.839 --> 3521.2799999999997
nah martin no it's

3518.16 --> 3526.0
yeah it's amusing but

3521.28 --> 3526.0
like i don't think so

3526.24 --> 3531.52
but yeah that's just he just likes it

3528.96 --> 3533.76
like that that's the way he does it

3531.52 --> 3535.92
and that's fine if he wants to do it

3533.76 --> 3537.2000000000003
like that that's fine but i will uphold

3535.92 --> 3544.2400000000002
my own

3537.2 --> 3547.1189999999997
more carefully thought out conceptions

3544.24 --> 3548.24
right but yeah i don't specifically even

3547.119 --> 3550.7200000000003
want to talk with him

3548.24 --> 3552.24
about the mud flood something very

3550.72 --> 3556.799
specific

3552.24 --> 3556.799
rather just talk about the whole thing

3557.119 --> 3560.96
like how did all everything change

3568.799 --> 3575.599
awake souls did a number on me oh

3575.599 --> 3582.799
cult leader did a number on me oh my god

i really thank you

3781.68 --> 3786.3999999999996
died from a wrong flu shot that sucks

3789.839 --> 3795.68
i'm even surprised just how things are

3793.52 --> 3799.52
continuing on and like

3795.68 --> 3800.3999999999996
even with people in the medical system

3799.52 --> 3803.119
that are

3800.4 --> 3805.44
just giving their professional opinions

3803.119 --> 3805.92
and they are just advising like against

3805.44 --> 3808.96
the

3805.92 --> 3812.4
top-down policy

3808.96 --> 3815.52
just that they're being ignored

3812.4 --> 3817.599
by people like even if like people that

3815.52 --> 3820.319
are professional just saying like no

3817.599 --> 3821.44
don't do that people are still going to

3820.319 --> 3824.4
do it

3821.44 --> 3826.48
why because there is this weird

3824.4 --> 3829.359
consensus

3826.48 --> 3830.2400000000002
spell going on that it's good it's just

3829.359 --> 3832.16
always good

3830.24 --> 3834.4799999999996
don't listen to the rumors and they just

3832.16 --> 3839.0389999999998
still do it even though

3834.48 --> 3841.52
actual professionals in that field

3839.039 --> 3843.44
give testimony like why they absolutely

3841.52 --> 3845.599
shouldn't do that and they just ignore

3843.44 --> 3845.599
it

3846.559 --> 3850.3190000000004
i guess that yeah some people would just

3848.799 --> 3853.839
rather die than wake up

3850.319 --> 3853.839
there's nothing you can do about it

3869.359 --> 3875.68
what are you talking about james mason

3871.28 --> 3875.6800000000003
malice amongst the flat earth community

3878.839 --> 3881.839
what

3906.88 --> 3911.839
what is pa for is that pasadena or

3909.44 --> 3911.839
something

3912.88 --> 3923.839
i i don't know what that stands for i'm

3915.28 --> 3923.8390000000004
not an american

3925.92 --> 3931.52
like what happened to patricia

3929.28 --> 3931.52
whoa

3933.52 --> 3939.119
oh pennsylvania alright right

3937.2 --> 3942.5589999999997
just goes to show that i'm not very

3939.119 --> 3942.559
informed about the shorts

3945.28 --> 3948.2400000000002
right but yeah

3950.799 --> 3957.2
what does that mean i

3954.0 --> 3957.2
i don't think i want to know

3958.0 --> 3963.68
but yeah malice amongst the flat earth

3960.559 --> 3966.1600000000003
well there's just going to be people

3963.68 --> 3966.16
that are

3966.88 --> 3975.2000000000003
like they snap out of the globe

3970.96 --> 3978.079
but then they're not basically given

3975.2 --> 3979.5989999999997
like the bigger responsibility the

3978.079 --> 3983.039
bigger mission it's very

3979.599 --> 3985.599
complicated so instead they just become

3983.039 --> 3987.6800000000003
extremely polarized and are just looking

3985.599 --> 3991.039
for enemies to squish

3987.68 --> 3992.3999999999996
and they become obsessed so yeah in that

3991.039 --> 3994.4
sense the awakening

3992.4 --> 3996.0
is not a guarantee that you'll actually

3994.4 --> 3999.76
become a wiser

3996.0 --> 4002.64
responsible type human being now it'll

3999.76 --> 4003.28
with some people it'll just lay down

4002.64 --> 4005.2799999999997
another

4003.28 --> 4006.88
layer of stress because they're

4005.28 --> 4009.039
confronted with something that in

4006.88 --> 4010.799
reality

4009.039 --> 4012.48
they can't really deal with it they

4010.799 --> 4016.24
can't overhaul their

4012.48 --> 4020.079
entire life to

4016.24 --> 4020.3999999999996
adapt to it not really so they just amp

4020.079 --> 4024.2400000000002
up

4020.4 --> 4027.76
aggression instead and look for targets

4024.24 --> 4030.64
this is unfortunately a natural response

4027.76 --> 4030.6400000000003
for a lot of people

4031.28 --> 4037.92
right they become outraged and then they

4034.4 --> 4037.92
just start looking for targets

4038.4 --> 4049.839
it's partial savoniae complex

4057.68 --> 4063.839
they are making the rock fin community

4065.76 --> 4069.92
specifically for flat earth really

4073.599 --> 4078.319
really is that for real yeah i did

4076.16 --> 4080.3999999999996
notice that by the way uh

4078.319 --> 4081.44
that jaron went live and he brought it

4080.4 --> 4086.48
up the rockfin

4081.44 --> 4086.48
thing i did actually

4086.64 --> 4092.64
well linked my google account to it so i

4089.599 --> 4092.6400000000003
can get on there

4094.64 --> 4101.3589999999995
right i'm still gonna kind of like

4098.56 --> 4103.04
watch it at a distance right there's

4101.359 --> 4106.799
many platforms that have

4103.04 --> 4109.359
come by i did kind of then check it out

4106.799 --> 4110.239
and then at some point it break it broke

4109.359 --> 4113.1990000000005
down

4110.239 --> 4114.159
doesn't really work it gets censored or

4113.199 --> 4117.919999999999
just the techno

4114.159 --> 4120.08
the system gets really a lot of delays

4117.92 --> 4123.279
and [ __ ]

4120.08 --> 4126.239
and it's just not worth it so yeah i'll

4123.279 --> 4126.2390000000005
check the rock fin

4127.12 --> 4132.159
but if as soon as you're going to say oh

4129.6 --> 4135.279
it's flat earth community only oh so

4132.159 --> 4137.92
which flat earth community is that

4135.279 --> 4141.279
you mean the bob earth community

4137.92 --> 4144.4
everybody associating with that

4141.279 --> 4146.56
or actually the flat earthers

4144.4 --> 4147.92
because that's a whole bunch of

4146.56 --> 4151.52
different peoples that

4147.92 --> 4153.12
really tend to not like each other as

4151.52 --> 4156.159000000001
much

4153.12 --> 4158.48
some of them get very hostile towards

4156.159 --> 4161.92
other groups

4158.48 --> 4162.718999999999
so yeah what the entire flat earth

4161.92 --> 4167.839
community

4162.719 --> 4167.839
really i don't know about that man

4168.239 --> 4170.639999999999
dude

4171.679 --> 4175.839
don't do that rest ahead

4200.84 --> 4217.84
um

4203.76 --> 4217.84
h buildings

4228.84 --> 4234.56
what

4231.44 --> 4245.839999999999
yes moth eyes i saw that

4234.56 --> 4245.84
it's it's kind of sloppy though

4250.4 --> 4257.36
yeah well rest ahead look dude if

4253.84 --> 4260.719
if you really want to put it on there

4257.36 --> 4263.759999999999
but make videos about it right

4260.719 --> 4266.2390000000005
i don't like to talk about that

4263.76 --> 4266.2390000000005
at all

4266.8 --> 4273.4400000000005
because it literally just ruins

4270.4 --> 4274.5599999999995
everything i do right once you start

4273.44 --> 4280.239
talking about that

4274.56 --> 4280.2390000000005
it ruins everything everything

4286.159 --> 4292.639999999999
besides i i personally don't have any

4289.36 --> 4292.96
definitive proof or any of that and i'm

4292.64 --> 4296.320000000001
not

4292.96 --> 4300.2390000000005
even comfortable researching it because

4296.32 --> 4302.88
it really makes me sick so

4300.239 --> 4304.4
hey if you want to do that the good by

4302.88 --> 4307.679
all means dude

4304.4 --> 4312.0
totally down your lane i'd say

4307.679 --> 4317.28
just get as hardcore as you can imagine

4312.0 --> 4317.28
but me no i i don't want to do that

4320.32 --> 4328.799999999999
right i already made a stand with yeah

4325.28 --> 4332.159
the bob situation one time i did that

4328.8 --> 4335.28
one freaking time look how much [ __ ]

4332.159 --> 4340.639999999999
came from just that one freaking time

4335.28 --> 4340.639999999999
yeah you really think i want more of

4340.84 --> 4343.84
that

4344.159 --> 4347.839999999999
tony has tons ugh

4349.28 --> 4354.84
well i don't even watch his channel man

4351.44 --> 4356.879999999999
i i don't go there i don't do it i don't

4354.84 --> 4360.32
wanna

4356.88 --> 4363.12
i really just don't wanna

4360.32 --> 4371.84
because it literally makes me sick and

4363.12 --> 4371.84
gives me nightmares

4382.84 --> 4385.84
so

4396.239 --> 4399.5199999999995
it's true well do something about it

4398.96 --> 4402.32
then

4399.52 --> 4404.56
if there's all this proof then why don't

4402.32 --> 4406.4
you make a freaking court case for it

4404.56 --> 4407.6
why don't you actually just start

4406.4 --> 4411.12
getting a lawyer

4407.6 --> 4414.88
do a gofundme to get a lawyer to arrest

4411.12 --> 4418.4
them for it how about that

4414.88 --> 4420.56
or are you just going to keep

4418.4 --> 4421.44
perpetuating oh look if they did this

4420.56 --> 4424.64
they did that

4421.44 --> 4428.159
for like the next 20 years as nothing

4424.64 --> 4430.8
ever is done about it ever right

4428.159 --> 4432.0
think that's gonna help anybody you're

4430.8 --> 4434.400000000001
just going to be

4432.0 --> 4436.239
the slanderers because you're not

4434.4 --> 4436.639999999999
actually doing anything about it you're

4436.239 --> 4441.839999999999
just

4436.64 --> 4441.84
trying to shove [ __ ] in people's face

4442.4 --> 4455.839999999999
unless yeah what are you gonna do

4461.28 --> 4468.08
okay genders well unfortunately

4464.4 --> 4471.36
as you say i appreciate the uh

4468.08 --> 4471.76
the support but hey if you're sure that

4471.36 --> 4473.679
you're

4471.76 --> 4477.04
never gonna believe flat earth well

4473.679 --> 4482.0
sorry sorry for you i don't really care

4477.04 --> 4484.719
right it's not my problem it's yours

4482.0 --> 4487.679
if you can't face the facts that's your

4484.719 --> 4487.679
personal problem

4493.52 --> 4497.84
what is that

4502.48 --> 4511.839999999999
oh that yeah right

4522.84 --> 4525.84
ugh

4531.76 --> 4535.84
one could say the same thing back to you

4533.679 --> 4538.96
oh really the facts

4535.84 --> 4542.159000000001
oh really am i not facing the facts do

4538.96 --> 4542.159
you know what facts are

4542.56 --> 4548.88
facts are repeatable provable

4546.159 --> 4550.839999999999
things that are grounded in actual

4548.88 --> 4553.84
empiricism

4550.84 --> 4553.84
right

4553.92 --> 4560.8
so yeah the earth is flat

4557.36 --> 4561.92
it's very very flat everything proves

4560.8 --> 4565.1990000000005
the earth is flat

4561.92 --> 4566.96
everything everything does there is no

4565.199 --> 4569.599999999999
proof it's a globe

4566.96 --> 4571.679
every time if something is put out as a

4569.6 --> 4572.8
proof of a globe it's only just so

4571.679 --> 4578.4
stories

4572.8 --> 4578.400000000001
bypassing actual facts making you

4578.48 --> 4584.959999999999
secretly presuppose the whole setup

4582.4 --> 4586.5599999999995
the fantastical setup every single time

4584.96 --> 4589.92
there is no proof there's a

4586.56 --> 4593.04
earth is a globe celestial bodies are

4589.92 --> 4597.84
physical in any form there's no proof

4593.04 --> 4601.76
whatsoever none

4597.84 --> 4603.52
there isn't any so yeah you could say

4601.76 --> 4603.92
the same thing back to me but it would

4603.52 --> 4606.320000000001
make

4603.92 --> 4607.28
absolutely no sense because there's

4606.32 --> 4610.799999999999
nothing that i'm

4607.28 --> 4614.199
ignoring right i won't ignore

4610.8 --> 4617.6
things if you present something as a

4614.199 --> 4620.719
globe-proofing fact i will not ignore it

4617.6 --> 4623.92
i will not move on to something else no

4620.719 --> 4624.56
i'll address the thing you say and then

4623.92 --> 4627.679
prove

4624.56 --> 4629.84
why it doesn't prove the earth is a

4627.679 --> 4632.88
globe exactly in detail

4629.84 --> 4635.52
because this is now second nature to me

4632.88 --> 4636.400000000001
right i've been doing this for years and

4635.52 --> 4640.4800000000005
years

4636.4 --> 4643.04
every single day i don't even have to

4640.48 --> 4643.919999999999
think or look anything up anymore i

4643.04 --> 4647.04
don't have to

4643.92 --> 4651.1990000000005
look anything up anymore to refute

4647.04 --> 4653.04
every single claim ever made

4651.199 --> 4655.44
that supposedly proves the earth is a

4653.04 --> 4655.44
globe

4657.28 --> 4661.28
i don't need to even google search

4659.84 --> 4664.2390000000005
anything anymore

4661.28 --> 4666.639999999999
i just know all the arguments ever

4664.239 --> 4678.159
devised by the globe side and can

4666.64 --> 4693.84
instantly refute them

4678.159 --> 4693.839999999999
hey i'm not here to argue

4702.56 --> 4708.400000000001
parallax what

4705.76 --> 4710.719
what's a minor detail aspect of

4708.4 --> 4714.4
presupposed setup

4710.719 --> 4716.8
right just like oh let's argue how

4714.4 --> 4717.599999999999
an observation of something in the

4716.8 --> 4720.96
distance

4717.6 --> 4721.360000000001
is earth curve whether it with whether

4720.96 --> 4723.12
it's

4721.36 --> 4724.96
part of that or not right well that's

4723.12 --> 4728.239
already presupposing

4724.96 --> 4730.88
immediately right

4728.239 --> 4731.919999999999
and that's constantly what they do they

4730.88 --> 4735.0
just say oh look

4731.92 --> 4736.64
this little detail in this elaborate

4735.0 --> 4739.28
presuppositional setup

4736.64 --> 4740.159000000001
assumption of something this little

4739.28 --> 4743.36
detail is

4740.159 --> 4746.08
supposed to prove our side

4743.36 --> 4746.799999999999
of a model assumption yeah good luck

4746.08 --> 4749.12
with that

4746.8 --> 4752.96
there's already so many presuppositions

4749.12 --> 4755.679
in there that have no backing whatsoever

4752.96 --> 4757.12
just you saying that technically already

4755.679 --> 4759.76
makes me win

4757.12 --> 4763.84
if i oppose it i just have to point out

4759.76 --> 4763.84
exactly what you're saying

4763.92 --> 4777.84
that's it

4788.84 --> 4791.84
uh

4801.199 --> 4806.638999999999
all this parallax stuff is just nonsense

4803.44 --> 4808.879999999999
to me it really is nonsense

4806.639 --> 4811.4400000000005
because parallax is based on the

4808.88 --> 4815.28
pre-assumption

4811.44 --> 4818.0
that any celestial activity up there

4815.28 --> 4819.12
any whatsoever the moon the sun the

4818.0 --> 4822.48
stars the planets

4819.12 --> 4825.5199999999995
any light based activity right

4822.48 --> 4828.5599999999995
parallax immediately implies

4825.52 --> 4832.719
that its objects in

4828.56 --> 4836.0
literal spatial locations

4832.719 --> 4840.0
it's ins like it can't even work

4836.0 --> 4843.36
if you don't assume that from the get-go

4840.0 --> 4846.8
it you can't even make the argument

4843.36 --> 4849.679
for or against it if you don't start out

4846.8 --> 4861.84
assuming all that

4849.679 --> 4861.84
right it's ridiculous

4884.48 --> 4888.78
right right because

4887.679 --> 4890.8
yeah there is no

4888.78 --> 4895.5199999999995
[Music]

4890.8 --> 4899.04
there is no deviation angular deviation

4895.52 --> 4902.639
of stars in relation to other stars

4899.04 --> 4903.679
in their angular location there is no

4902.639 --> 4907.12
deviation

4903.679 --> 4909.679
between them like the star map

4907.12 --> 4911.36
up there the way everything is divided

4909.679 --> 4914.719
angular wise

4911.36 --> 4918.32
never alters it never

4914.719 --> 4921.44
ever alters there has been no star

4918.32 --> 4922.799999999999
angular displacement in relation to any

4921.44 --> 4926.159
other star

4922.8 --> 4929.76
ever ever ever in history

4926.159 --> 4932.719
ever never has any star actually

4929.76 --> 4933.360000000001
angular wise move in relation to another

4932.719 --> 4936.88
star

4933.36 --> 4945.839999999999
ever the whole

4936.88 --> 4945.84
idea is ridiculous

4949.199 --> 4953.5689999999995
hey jim

4950.52 --> 4953.569
[Music]

4954.88 --> 4959.84
right so yeah i'm definitely gonna

4956.48 --> 4959.839999999999
finish the second hour

4960.639 --> 4973.84
so i'll be back in two minutes

5059.52 --> 5061.84
hmm

5065.44 --> 5071.839999999999
wow dude

5075.92 --> 5079.92
that's a lot of muscle there rest ahead

5082.84 --> 5085.84
damn

5091.76 --> 5098.719
no polk urine no no

5095.44 --> 5102.159
there is no three options convex concave

5098.719 --> 5106.639
no it's flat there is no curvature

5102.159 --> 5110.48
whatsoever none zero percent curvature

5106.639 --> 5112.8
zero no concave curvature

5110.48 --> 5113.678999999999
no convex curvature there is no

5112.8 --> 5117.12
curvature

5113.679 --> 5127.84
zero zero zero zero

5117.12 --> 5127.84
zero zero

5131.84 --> 5135.360000000001
i'm not an expert no why would i be an

5134.56 --> 5138.639
expert i'm

5135.36 --> 5140.5599999999995
only part of the flat earth debate every

5138.639 --> 5143.6
single day

5140.56 --> 5146.96
pretty much since it started up i talk

5143.6 --> 5149.6
with guys that are actually mechanical

5146.96 --> 5152.159
mathematical technical experts

5149.6 --> 5153.360000000001
with all of that way beyond my own

5152.159 --> 5156.48
capacity

5153.36 --> 5158.159
every day for hours even after the life

5156.48 --> 5161.28
and the recorded show

5158.159 --> 5162.08
why would i have any expertise on there

5161.28 --> 5165.679
not being

5162.08 --> 5169.6
any bit of curvature

5165.679 --> 5172.4
yeah i am i know everybody

5169.6 --> 5174.0
i'll ever need to know in order to be

5172.4 --> 5177.36
very assured that there is

5174.0 --> 5181.04
no curvature whatsoever not even

5177.36 --> 5183.44
just a slight bit nothing zero

5181.04 --> 5186.639
zero curvature of all forms it's

5183.44 --> 5186.638999999999
absolutely flat

5187.04 --> 5190.8
very very flat

5189.04 --> 5193.84
[Music]

5190.8 --> 5195.360000000001
right i can't claim perfect flatness

5193.84 --> 5196.639
even though i'm kind of asserting it

5195.36 --> 5200.159
right now sort of

5196.639 --> 5203.679
just to make a point because yeah

5200.159 --> 5206.799999999999
look what if there was like

5203.679 --> 5208.56
half a percent curvature over the entire

5206.8 --> 5210.400000000001
realm or something right yeah then it

5208.56 --> 5212.8
wouldn't technically be perfectly flat

5210.4 --> 5215.5199999999995
but there's no way to even measure it

5212.8 --> 5218.08
because you can't even see things far

5215.52 --> 5218.88
enough in order to establish this curve

5218.08 --> 5221.679
right that's

5218.88 --> 5222.719
that's the problem so technically

5221.679 --> 5225.84
technically it

5222.719 --> 5229.12
might be not entirely

5225.84 --> 5231.04
absolutely perfectly flat but

5229.12 --> 5232.48
that's why i'd like to say it's flat

5231.04 --> 5236.08
enough like

5232.48 --> 5238.159
absolutely flat enough it's so flat that

5236.08 --> 5241.12
there is just no curvature that we can

5238.159 --> 5241.12
detect ever

5242.08 --> 5245.6
and flat yeah it's a rel no it's an

5244.48 --> 5250.839999999999
orientative

5245.6 --> 5255.6
term it's a geometrical orientational

5250.84 --> 5255.6
term it gives you the aspect

5256.159 --> 5260.239
of the orientation of the surface

5265.04 --> 5267.84
right

5270.239 --> 5273.599999999999
so that's why i say it's flat enough

5272.56 --> 5276.56
flat is the side

5273.6 --> 5277.76
no it is flat you need to let go of

5276.56 --> 5281.120000000001
those curves buddy

5277.76 --> 5282.08
it's flat it's very very flat it's not

5281.12 --> 5286.159
the new globe

5282.08 --> 5290.88
it is flat it is flat it's not concave

5286.159 --> 5293.92
it's flat there is no point

5290.88 --> 5294.8
ever where you could see some kind of

5293.92 --> 5297.92
inverted

5294.8 --> 5299.12
curve where you can suddenly look at the

5297.92 --> 5302.2390000000005
land

5299.12 --> 5305.04
like this looking top down

5302.239 --> 5307.678999999999
while you look past the horizon you're

5305.04 --> 5310.719
never gonna look top down

5307.679 --> 5313.679
you're never gonna look top down

5310.719 --> 5314.719
as you look at the horizon you're never

5313.679 --> 5318.2390000000005
gonna see that

5314.719 --> 5320.719
ever you would have to

5318.239 --> 5321.5199999999995
right if you wanna know if it's concave

5320.719 --> 5324.56
then get

5321.52 --> 5325.679
like a major major telescope aim it at

5324.56 --> 5328.8
the horizon

5325.679 --> 5332.96
and look look

5328.8 --> 5336.2390000000005
at the tops of buildings the top of them

5332.96 --> 5336.56
not the side the top of them in the very

5336.239 --> 5340.5599999999995
far

5336.56 --> 5343.4400000000005
distance see the ground the flat ground

5340.56 --> 5346.2390000000005
at an angle in the very far distance

5343.44 --> 5350.799999999999
right that's what you would have to see

5346.239 --> 5353.36
if it was concave and even every sci-fi

5350.8 --> 5356.0
series that has ever done anything with

5353.36 --> 5359.92
a concave setup of any sort

5356.0 --> 5362.32
proves that for look ever seen babylon 5

5359.92 --> 5366.0
the inside of that station

5362.32 --> 5369.28
5 miles long concave

5366.0 --> 5374.0
or the the knight is sphere

5369.28 --> 5374.0
what is it the dyson sphere in star trek

5374.32 --> 5379.759999999999
yeah those are actual representations of

5377.6 --> 5383.679
what you would have to see

5379.76 --> 5386.8
if it's concave it's not concave

5383.679 --> 5389.52
it's flat no psyop

5386.8 --> 5389.52
just a fact

5390.48 --> 5393.839999999999
hey adam meekin

5394.8 --> 5398.400000000001
yeah five miles is nothing how about a

5397.28 --> 5401.44
hundred miles

5398.4 --> 5402.4
of absolute flatness how about that how

5401.44 --> 5406.32
about

5402.4 --> 5409.679
seeing a mountain

5406.32 --> 5410.4
a hundred miles away with the sun behind

5409.679 --> 5413.92
it

5410.4 --> 5415.92
a hundred miles away and a very low

5413.92 --> 5418.32
observation height is that flat enough

5415.92 --> 5418.32
for you

5419.6 --> 5422.320000000001
i think so

5432.84 --> 5435.84
hey

5460.84 --> 5463.84
so

5488.84 --> 5493.1990000000005
um

5490.08 --> 5495.76
so paul kiran why do you hold why do you

5493.199 --> 5498.4
believe in concave why

5495.76 --> 5505.84
what makes you think that it's concave

5498.4 --> 5505.839999999999
why do you hold on why do you persist

5507.44 --> 5519.839999999999
i really wonder

5521.52 --> 5525.92
because i researched the three options

5523.84 --> 5529.28
okay and did you straw man

5525.92 --> 5533.92
the flat earth option did you

5529.28 --> 5537.92
did you assume a complete model

5533.92 --> 5541.36
did you assume a disc

5537.92 --> 5545.6
with a dome in that flat earth

5541.36 --> 5547.28
option yeah did you straw man the flat

5545.6 --> 5561.84
earth

5547.28 --> 5561.84
in your consideration did you

5562.48 --> 5567.199
what's next are you gonna do the global

5564.48 --> 5570.08
thing and tell me oh but

5567.199 --> 5571.44
you you can't see these things on a flat

5570.08 --> 5573.199
earth model

5571.44 --> 5575.759999999999
is that what you're gonna say right now

5573.199 --> 5577.36
i get the feeling you will

5575.76 --> 5580.2390000000005
because that's what the ballers do and

5577.36 --> 5583.04
concavers copy this behavior

5580.239 --> 5584.4
to the letter it's exactly what all

5583.04 --> 5587.84
concavers have done

5584.4 --> 5588.48
so far it's just straw man flat earth

5587.84 --> 5591.28
models

5588.48 --> 5592.239
in exactly the same way that globers do

5591.28 --> 5595.759999999999
exactly

5592.239 --> 5595.759999999999
to the letter

5598.96 --> 5605.04
the sky kills oh my god

5602.0 --> 5608.48
how how does it do that poke karen

5605.04 --> 5608.8
how is the sky impossible on a flat

5608.48 --> 5612.638999999999
earth

5608.8 --> 5612.639
you explain that to me right now

5613.12 --> 5620.8
come on how does the sky

5616.88 --> 5631.84
disprove the flat earth come on

5620.8 --> 5631.84
give it a shot

5641.36 --> 5646.48
research them without bias oh are you

5644.8 --> 5650.400000000001
you're telling me i have to

5646.48 --> 5654.32
google it you can't actually explain it

5650.4 --> 5654.879999999999
right paul kieran when have you caught

5654.32 --> 5657.199
me

5654.88 --> 5658.159000000001
telling people when they actually tried

5657.199 --> 5661.199
to argue

5658.159 --> 5664.08
something like yeah

5661.199 --> 5665.12
no dude you just gotta research flat

5664.08 --> 5668.4
earth some more

5665.12 --> 5671.5199999999995
unbiased then you'll know no no no

5668.4 --> 5674.5599999999995
see here's what i do i actually

5671.52 --> 5677.84
give the arguments

5674.56 --> 5678.4800000000005
right there right then i don't tell

5677.84 --> 5681.1990000000005
people oh

5678.48 --> 5681.759999999999
just research that no no just google it

5681.199 --> 5685.04
no

5681.76 --> 5689.52
i tell the arguments

5685.04 --> 5693.28
right don't tell me just research it

5689.52 --> 5693.280000000001
give me the arguments

5695.44 --> 5699.48
two hemispheres what am i spheres what

5698.48 --> 5704.4
are you talking about

5699.48 --> 5704.4
epispheres you mean the stars

5704.48 --> 5708.638999999999
moon halos sun dogs sun hill lights so

5708.08 --> 5712.639
you mean

5708.639 --> 5714.56
everything celestial light based so

5712.639 --> 5717.04
the celestial lights and your

5714.56 --> 5719.52
presumptions about what they are

5717.04 --> 5720.48
is your proof that the earth is not flat

5719.52 --> 5724.400000000001
is it

5720.48 --> 5727.04
right there's another group of people

5724.4 --> 5728.0
i warned you that bring out the same

5727.04 --> 5732.239
arguments

5728.0 --> 5735.04
you know they are ballers right they say

5732.239 --> 5736.5599999999995
celestial bodies that can't work on a

5735.04 --> 5739.5199999999995
flat earth model

5736.56 --> 5740.320000000001
doesn't work why is there why is it is

5739.52 --> 5743.76
fair

5740.32 --> 5745.92
why is it a sphere around us why are we

5743.76 --> 5747.52
presupposing that is a sphere around us

5745.92 --> 5748.8
and it can only work if we're standing

5747.52 --> 5751.92
on a sphere

5748.8 --> 5755.119000000001
yeah it's because you assume

5751.92 --> 5757.04
those lights are physical things in

5755.119 --> 5760.239
literal positions

5757.04 --> 5762.96
somehow right

5760.239 --> 5764.4
by the way it would work even less on a

5762.96 --> 5767.36
concave model

5764.4 --> 5768.638999999999
it actually does not work on a concave

5767.36 --> 5771.36
model at all

5768.639 --> 5773.119
i've looked into that that early model

5771.36 --> 5774.08
from lord stephen christ at the early

5773.119 --> 5776.159
start

5774.08 --> 5778.4
it's quite delusional it makes

5776.159 --> 5780.48
absolutely no logical connections with

5778.4 --> 5781.04
the orientation of any of the celestial

5780.48 --> 5784.32
lights

5781.04 --> 5785.119
whatsoever it's like a weird warped

5784.32 --> 5788.32
hologram

5785.119 --> 5791.36
thing right yeah my

5788.32 --> 5792.32
system for the celestial lights are kind

5791.36 --> 5794.719
of hologram

5792.32 --> 5796.799999999999
as well except mine actually make

5794.719 --> 5799.84
consistent sense

5796.8 --> 5801.679
right they actually make sense it's very

5799.84 --> 5804.4800000000005
simple

5801.679 --> 5805.679
you see the celestial lights at the edge

5804.48 --> 5808.879999999999
of vision

5805.679 --> 5812.0
as a demisphere and it

5808.88 --> 5814.8
orientates itself in relation to

5812.0 --> 5817.44
the observer's position at all times in

5814.8 --> 5819.6
a very consistent fashion

5817.44 --> 5820.638999999999
right because none of those lights are

5819.6 --> 5824.0
actually

5820.639 --> 5826.56
in any position they just appear

5824.0 --> 5827.76
in an angular position in relation to

5826.56 --> 5831.4400000000005
the observer

5827.76 --> 5832.96
when you follow up on the triangulated

5831.44 --> 5836.719
position

5832.96 --> 5838.719
using any baseline assumption of the

5836.719 --> 5842.0
orientation of the surface

5838.719 --> 5842.88
any of them if you follow up and try to

5842.0 --> 5846.159
coordinate

5842.88 --> 5848.4800000000005
where is that in literal physical space

5846.159 --> 5849.599999999999
yeah guess what none of them are

5848.48 --> 5852.638999999999
anywhere

5849.6 --> 5856.159000000001
they're not lights in literal positions

5852.639 --> 5858.32
right it's holographic it only appears

5856.159 --> 5859.28
at an angular position in relation to

5858.32 --> 5861.199
the observer

5859.28 --> 5862.5599999999995
all of the celestial light including the

5861.199 --> 5866.32
sun right

5862.56 --> 5870.56
they are holograms yeah the light

5866.32 --> 5873.119
is absorbed on the earth there is light

5870.56 --> 5875.679
being transferred and it is being

5873.119 --> 5878.96
absorbed by the material here on earth

5875.679 --> 5882.719
that's right is it coming from a

5878.96 --> 5885.92
literal lamp thing in the sky

5882.719 --> 5889.119
very far away very close no

5885.92 --> 5889.76
no it's not you can't follow up on that

5889.119 --> 5892.5599999999995
you can't

5889.76 --> 5893.360000000001
actually reach the place where this

5892.56 --> 5896.719
light

5893.36 --> 5899.839999999999
starts it's just manifesting

5896.719 --> 5901.76
it's light manifest you see the

5899.84 --> 5904.8
celestial bodies

5901.76 --> 5907.6
as a holographic side effect

5904.8 --> 5909.6
of looking straight into the light's

5907.6 --> 5914.0
direction of that specific

5909.6 --> 5918.08
type yeah that's how it works

5914.0 --> 5921.199
and it works on a flat earth very well

5918.08 --> 5925.84
and it even leaves open as to what

5921.199 --> 5925.839999999999
is the actual realm layout

5926.239 --> 5930.5599999999995
what is it actually how is the layout

5928.719 --> 5933.28
how do the land bodies

5930.56 --> 5935.52
and the ocean surface actually

5933.28 --> 5938.639
interconnect

5935.52 --> 5942.1990000000005
it leaves that open because it is open

5938.639 --> 5943.84
it is not set it is only set if you

5942.199 --> 5946.4
presuppose

5943.84 --> 5947.360000000001
through triangulation that the celestial

5946.4 --> 5949.839999999999
bodies are in

5947.36 --> 5951.5199999999995
literal positions and then suddenly you

5949.84 --> 5955.1990000000005
get stuck to a disc

5951.52 --> 5957.360000000001
it has to be a disc or the coordinates

5955.199 --> 5958.799999999999
of the presupposed light bodies that

5957.36 --> 5960.239
have literal positions in that

5958.8 --> 5963.360000000001
presupposition

5960.239 --> 5963.36
doesn't work anymore

5964.08 --> 5971.76
yeah that's why i'm taking that away

5967.84 --> 5976.400000000001
they are not lights in literal euclidean

5971.76 --> 5979.360000000001
cartesian positions they're holograms

5976.4 --> 5980.96
of light manifesting reaching earth

5979.36 --> 5984.08
being absorbed

5980.96 --> 5987.28
on earth not coming from literal

5984.08 --> 5989.679
positions in the sky

5987.28 --> 5992.4
it just seems that way because when you

5989.679 --> 5995.4400000000005
look at that light manifest

5992.4 --> 5997.5199999999995
there is a holographic thing like a

5995.44 --> 5999.919999999999
signature a holographic signature

5997.52 --> 6001.6
correlating with that specific light

5999.92 --> 6004.96
coming from that angular

6001.6 --> 6009.04
position right it's not coming

6004.96 --> 6012.159
from a thing anywhere it's just

6009.04 --> 6015.199
manifesting yeah it's weird isn't it

6012.159 --> 6016.159
it's weird guess what it's true you

6015.199 --> 6018.5599999999995
don't have proof

6016.159 --> 6019.679
any of the lights actually come from

6018.56 --> 6023.4400000000005
literal

6019.679 --> 6024.32
light emitting objects you don't have

6023.44 --> 6027.28
the proof

6024.32 --> 6028.0
nobody has the proof nobody's ever

6027.28 --> 6031.119
actually

6028.0 --> 6036.48
gathered the proof for any of that ever

6031.119 --> 6039.5199999999995
ever in any modeling process ever

6036.48 --> 6043.119
science bro science bro yeah

6039.52 --> 6043.119000000001
sure it's science bro

6043.28 --> 6046.5599999999995
oh that's a lot of guessing and bias

6045.28 --> 6049.5199999999995
there oh really so

6046.56 --> 6050.159000000001
do you have any proof do you do you have

6049.52 --> 6052.8
actual

6050.159 --> 6055.28
physical evidence that any of the

6052.8 --> 6056.08
celestial light bodies are in literal

6055.28 --> 6058.239
positions

6056.08 --> 6060.48
have you ever approached any of the

6058.239 --> 6061.5199999999995
light bodies the holograms that i assume

6060.48 --> 6064.638999999999
are holograms

6061.52 --> 6067.84
and then noticed as the angular

6064.639 --> 6071.28
size increases yeah

6067.84 --> 6074.32
angular size increasing which is what

6071.28 --> 6078.08
happens when you approach physical

6074.32 --> 6081.599999999999
objects yeah has anybody ever witnessed

6078.08 --> 6084.719
that ever ever ever ever

6081.6 --> 6088.159000000001
ever no no

6084.719 --> 6092.2390000000005
no no nobody has

6088.159 --> 6094.32
yeah that's why i stick to those details

6092.239 --> 6095.599999999999
because there is no evidence that has

6094.32 --> 6099.44
ever countered that

6095.6 --> 6099.4400000000005
ever ever ever

6100.56 --> 6104.4800000000005
unless you'd like to present that yeah

6102.56 --> 6104.96
i've put that challenge out for what is

6104.48 --> 6107.44
it now

6104.96 --> 6108.159
three years three years the challenges

6107.44 --> 6110.719
out there

6108.159 --> 6111.44
provide the evidence that perspective

6110.719 --> 6114.96
applies to

6111.44 --> 6118.08
any of the celestial bodies yeah

6114.96 --> 6120.639
guess what none has been presented in

6118.08 --> 6125.199
three years

6120.639 --> 6125.1990000000005
so good luck with that and your science

6132.84 --> 6135.84
bro

6143.119 --> 6147.599999999999
rainbows are spiritual manifestation no

6145.76 --> 6150.8
i don't think so

6147.6 --> 6151.679
they're the breaking up of light the

6150.8 --> 6155.04
light is there

6151.679 --> 6157.52
there is light being here it's arriving

6155.04 --> 6158.56
it's it's actually arriving it's being

6157.52 --> 6162.0
absorbed

6158.56 --> 6163.4400000000005
right that light can be broken into a

6162.0 --> 6165.6
rainbow

6163.44 --> 6168.32
through water droplets that's that's

6165.6 --> 6170.320000000001
happening yeah the light is arriving

6168.32 --> 6172.5599999999995
there is things happening with it it can

6170.32 --> 6176.159
be obstructed by physical things so you

6172.56 --> 6180.400000000001
don't see the light there

6176.159 --> 6183.839999999999
get what dude do you want to get banned

6180.4 --> 6187.04
you want to get banned there paul kieran

6183.84 --> 6187.92
can't you handle the challenge the

6187.04 --> 6191.28
challenge where

6187.92 --> 6192.4
you get to provide proof that any of the

6191.28 --> 6196.0
celestial bodies

6192.4 --> 6200.0
any including the moon abide

6196.0 --> 6204.88
by the rules of physicality

6200.0 --> 6207.76
when you approach it when you

6204.88 --> 6208.639
yeah when you try to go towards it

6207.76 --> 6211.679
perspective

6208.639 --> 6213.119
will make it bigger yeah

6211.679 --> 6216.4
where's the evidence where's your

6213.119 --> 6218.32
evidence where is it where is it

6216.4 --> 6219.599999999999
you go for it why don't you provide

6218.32 --> 6224.4
evidence

6219.6 --> 6228.96
to counter the things that i've stated

6224.4 --> 6232.4
i do reach oh well okay well bye

6228.96 --> 6237.44
bye concave tart bye

6232.4 --> 6240.879999999999
bye you're an idiot

6237.44 --> 6242.239
you don't listen to facts you don't

6240.88 --> 6246.0
actually

6242.239 --> 6249.28
take challenges you're just asserting

6246.0 --> 6251.679
nonsense saying oh just research it oh

6249.28 --> 6252.4
science bro yeah no you're like a

6251.679 --> 6255.04
baltard

6252.4 --> 6255.759999999999
you're an inverse baltard that's what

6255.04 --> 6259.04
you are

6255.76 --> 6262.400000000001
paul cured you're an inverse baltard

6259.04 --> 6264.32
right i don't care whether you think

6262.4 --> 6265.92
you're on the outside of a ball or on

6264.32 --> 6268.08
the inside of a ball

6265.92 --> 6269.1990000000005
when you stick to the same arguments you

6268.08 --> 6271.6
are a baltard

6269.199 --> 6273.199
whether it's inverse baltard or just a

6271.6 --> 6276.4800000000005
regular one

6273.199 --> 6289.839999999999
you're one and now you're banned

6276.48 --> 6289.839999999999
because you're an idiot

6300.84 --> 6306.719
this rainbows in the sky could be coming

6304.8 --> 6308.4800000000005
from anywhere i don't know what to

6306.719 --> 6308.8
believe no they're definitely coming

6308.48 --> 6313.119
from

6308.8 --> 6316.400000000001
sunlight sunlight hitting water droplets

6313.119 --> 6319.599999999999
then the water basically breaks up

6316.4 --> 6322.799999999999
that sunlight right which is

6319.6 --> 6326.2390000000005
specific to the observer

6322.8 --> 6327.119000000001
yes specific every light manifest every

6326.239 --> 6329.04
rainbow

6327.119 --> 6330.88
which is derived from anything that

6329.04 --> 6332.639
comes originally

6330.88 --> 6334.639
from some kind of celestial light

6332.639 --> 6337.679
whether it's a halo

6334.639 --> 6340.8
a sun dog a rainbow

6337.679 --> 6344.08
or a lens flare it's

6340.8 --> 6347.28
all coming from holographic

6344.08 --> 6351.04
based light unique to the observer

6347.28 --> 6354.5599999999995
l every observer gets a unique display

6351.04 --> 6357.6
unique perfectly 100 unique

6354.56 --> 6360.0
because if you stand a few meters

6357.6 --> 6360.88
away from that you're not going to see

6360.0 --> 6364.4
the same thing

6360.88 --> 6367.119
the entire light manifestation

6364.4 --> 6367.839999999999
is going to be slightly angular wise

6367.119 --> 6369.839999999999
different

6367.84 --> 6371.4400000000005
the entire thing is going to be slightly

6369.84 --> 6374.88
angular wise different

6371.44 --> 6376.0
because every celestial light is unique

6374.88 --> 6378.159000000001
to the observer

6376.0 --> 6379.76
every light display from the celestial

6378.159 --> 6383.5199999999995
lights including the sun

6379.76 --> 6386.96
is absolutely unique a unique

6383.52 --> 6389.4400000000005
holographic display

6386.96 --> 6391.84
right and until anybody here would like

6389.44 --> 6396.638999999999
to contest that by actually

6391.84 --> 6398.56
proving that perspective applies

6396.639 --> 6401.04
to the celestial light that you can

6398.56 --> 6404.320000000001
approach them and they'll get bigger

6401.04 --> 6407.28
yeah until somebody provides any

6404.32 --> 6408.5599999999995
evidence at all i'm going to stick to

6407.28 --> 6410.08
this concept

6408.56 --> 6411.92
because it seems to be working out

6410.08 --> 6414.32
really well so far yeah

6411.92 --> 6415.679
you can't contest it unless you can

6414.32 --> 6419.199
actually prove

6415.679 --> 6421.84
their physical objects yeah

6419.199 --> 6424.0
yeah so go ahead go improve their

6421.84 --> 6426.4800000000005
physical objects

6424.0 --> 6427.119
let's judge the evidence when presented

6426.48 --> 6429.678999999999
right

6427.119 --> 6430.5599999999995
nobody's doing that though in three

6429.679 --> 6432.159
years

6430.56 --> 6434.4800000000005
that i've put out this challenge and

6432.159 --> 6438.0
remind people every now and then

6434.48 --> 6440.638999999999
nobody does that ever just show you more

6438.0 --> 6441.52
cgi nonsense if you're like a full globe

6440.639 --> 6443.679
tart

6441.52 --> 6446.8
to say satellites oh look we have a

6443.679 --> 6450.4800000000005
satellite close to the sun total is cgi

6446.8 --> 6452.159000000001
garbage everybody knows that's a lie

6450.48 --> 6454.0
right and it's not proving an approach

6452.159 --> 6456.719
either it's just oh oh

6454.0 --> 6457.199
now we have this thing here this still

6456.719 --> 6460.4
view

6457.199 --> 6462.48
in space yeah yeah you don't show how

6460.4 --> 6465.36
you actually approach it though right

6462.48 --> 6466.5599999999995
just like with the entire moon landing

6465.36 --> 6468.96
situation

6466.56 --> 6470.56
they didn't just oh look look we are

6468.96 --> 6473.679
actually now

6470.56 --> 6477.119000000001
showing you the entire trip of

6473.679 --> 6479.679
leaving earth into a ball

6477.119 --> 6481.119
and then oh look the moon we're

6479.679 --> 6483.76
approaching the moon

6481.119 --> 6484.799999999999
it's getting bigger no no you don't show

6483.76 --> 6487.76
that

6484.8 --> 6489.679
ever ever there is no footage of this

6487.76 --> 6492.08
ever it can't even be done they don't

6489.679 --> 6495.92
even know how to fake it

6492.08 --> 6495.92
they can't even fake it

6496.719 --> 6504.56
unless you just take pure cgi rendering

6501.52 --> 6507.76
where you can literally enforce the sun

6504.56 --> 6509.92
and the moon to be physical objects or

6507.76 --> 6512.56
you can shape it however you like

6509.92 --> 6513.84
when it comes to actual video footage in

6512.56 --> 6518.88
the real world

6513.84 --> 6518.88
they can't even trick it they can't do

6524.84 --> 6527.84
it

6539.52 --> 6545.1990000000005
always been moved bob is so below oh

6542.8 --> 6545.1990000000005
god

6548.32 --> 6554.719
yeah sorry dudes but concave people

6551.679 --> 6557.679
are really [ __ ] stupid and

6554.719 --> 6558.88
that's it it's that's not an insult it's

6557.679 --> 6562.0
the truth

6558.88 --> 6563.1990000000005
if you seriously stick to the idea of a

6562.0 --> 6565.119
concave earth

6563.199 --> 6566.839999999999
with the evidence that has been

6565.119 --> 6570.0
supposedly

6566.84 --> 6573.04
delivered to support that

6570.0 --> 6575.92
you're really [ __ ] stupid

6573.04 --> 6576.88
you're a religious zealot for no damn

6575.92 --> 6580.2390000000005
reason

6576.88 --> 6584.2390000000005
right if you believe

6580.239 --> 6584.239
the earth is concave you're an idiot

6585.92 --> 6589.599
i don't care who you are how much money

6588.48 --> 6592.638999999999
you make

6589.599 --> 6594.8
how well you can get about with words if

6592.639 --> 6598.32
you believe the earth is concave

6594.8 --> 6610.4800000000005
you're an idiot you're just as stupid as

6598.32 --> 6613.28
a baller

6610.48 --> 6615.04
okay feet upwards curve oh you have any

6613.28 --> 6616.719
evidence for that

6615.04 --> 6619.36
show me the proof for that george

6616.719 --> 6622.96
sanford pretty sure it doesn't exist or

6619.36 --> 6625.28
we'd be getting that sort of imagery

6622.96 --> 6627.28
shoved in her face constantly and then

6625.28 --> 6629.119
the concave earth would suddenly start

6627.28 --> 6631.84
to make some way

6629.119 --> 6633.839999999999
right it would suddenly become ballers

6631.84 --> 6635.04
versus concave because certainly the

6633.84 --> 6637.04
concave is actual

6635.04 --> 6638.639
visual evidence that sort of supports

6637.04 --> 6640.639
their claim and then the ballers will

6638.639 --> 6642.08
see you as an actual threat

6640.639 --> 6644.56
because you dispel their ball and

6642.08 --> 6646.88
they're like oh no it's terrestrial it's

6644.56 --> 6649.84
like double terrestrial refraction

6646.88 --> 6650.8
it it looks it's a ball because it looks

6649.84 --> 6653.92
so concave

6650.8 --> 6654.96
that's what would happen right that's

6653.92 --> 6657.92
what would happen

6654.96 --> 6658.719
guess what it's not happening it's not

6657.92 --> 6661.679
happening

6658.719 --> 6664.84
no flat earth is the threat you know why

6661.679 --> 6668.4
because it is

6664.84 --> 6670.8
flat flat it's not concave

6668.4 --> 6673.04
you're not a threat to the established

6670.8 --> 6675.1990000000005
religious order of the ball

6673.04 --> 6677.119
because it's not concave you're not a

6675.199 --> 6679.119
threat because it's wrong

6677.119 --> 6680.639
and you have no evidence to support your

6679.119 --> 6683.598999999999
claims

6680.639 --> 6683.92
just have a lot of nonsense stories kind

6683.599 --> 6687.84
of

6683.92 --> 6689.679
the inverse version of what ballers do

6687.84 --> 6692.56
to supposedly prove the earth is a

6689.679 --> 6695.04
sphere in the face of flat earthers yeah

6692.56 --> 6697.360000000001
that's what you're doing as a concaver

6695.04 --> 6699.28
you are literally just an inside-out

6697.36 --> 6702.5599999999995
baller

6699.28 --> 6703.679
you are an inside-out baller and you're

6702.56 --> 6705.679
not a threat

6703.679 --> 6708.08
to the established order of the

6705.679 --> 6710.639
heliocentric religion

6708.08 --> 6711.599
because you're wrong that's why you're

6710.639 --> 6714.159000000001
not a threat

6711.599 --> 6715.84
because you're wrong if you were right

6714.159 --> 6718.96
you would be a threat

6715.84 --> 6721.119000000001
and you're not because you're wrong

6718.96 --> 6722.0
and you can't get over that apparently

6721.119 --> 6737.839999999999
this is really

6722.0 --> 6737.84
stupid and silly

6745.599 --> 6751.84
no paul is not back as jedo jedo is a

6748.32 --> 6751.84
genuine person here

6752.88 --> 6759.599
thank you well for the 20 australian

6755.84 --> 6759.599
dollar super chat donation that's a lot

6762.32 --> 6767.199
that's cool although i yeah i'm gonna

6765.36 --> 6768.08
complain about this every single time

6767.199 --> 6771.919999999999
anybody gets

6768.08 --> 6774.08
sends me over like a dollar super chat

6771.92 --> 6778.56
if you actually wish to financially

6774.08 --> 6782.719
support me please choose paypal

6778.56 --> 6782.719
because i get that the full amount

6783.04 --> 6786.88
and i get it quick i cannot say the same

6786.48 --> 6789.36
for

6786.88 --> 6789.92
super chats in which i only receive

6789.36 --> 6792.639
about

6789.92 --> 6794.159
three percent and it takes over a month

6792.639 --> 6797.599
to even get there

6794.159 --> 6800.799999999999
right but sure if you want to

6797.599 --> 6801.92
highlight a message super chat's the way

6800.8 --> 6805.04
to do it

6801.92 --> 6807.84
if you financially want to support me

6805.04 --> 6809.5199999999995
then keep the super chat amount small

6807.84 --> 6812.639
because it'll still cost you

6809.52 --> 6815.360000000001
and just send paypal

6812.639 --> 6820.4800000000005
but thank you jedo i appreciate that i

6815.36 --> 6822.08
appreciate the gesture

6820.48 --> 6824.959999999999
right i got about five more minutes

6822.08 --> 6835.84
before i'm gonna round out the show

6824.96 --> 6835.84
it's been interesting

6847.84 --> 6850.8
arctic land

6852.8 --> 6855.1990000000005
mount

6855.92 --> 6859.4400000000005
in alaska what about it george sanford

6858.32 --> 6864.08
what about the mountain

6859.44 --> 6864.08
it's a mountain what's so special about

6874.84 --> 6877.84
it

6887.119 --> 6890.96
did you see my link to the skydive

6889.44 --> 6894.48
rainbow what

6890.96 --> 6898.639
i must have missed it iron 26

6894.48 --> 6902.239
where did you post that oh yeah i see it

6898.639 --> 6905.84
okay i'll take a look i'm gonna

6902.239 --> 6905.839999999999
keep it short though

6908.639 --> 6923.4400000000005
wow talk about a fisheye lens there dude

6918.8 --> 6926.96
wow that is amazing

6923.44 --> 6931.28
wow the rainbow all the way down there

6926.96 --> 6934.639
man that is that is uncanny

6931.28 --> 6934.639
that is really amazing

6938.8 --> 6943.1990000000005
all right just goes to show the rainbow

6940.96 --> 6945.119
will manifest

6943.199 --> 6947.759999999999
from the vantage point of where the

6945.119 --> 6950.0
moist is actually reflecting it

6947.76 --> 6951.04
right is is is breaking it and then

6950.0 --> 6954.159
displaying that

6951.04 --> 6956.88
but it looks really amazing

6954.159 --> 6956.879999999999
that's awesome

6958.0 --> 6961.92
it also does stand out that as they are

6960.0 --> 6966.239
descending that

6961.92 --> 6966.2390000000005
the location is basically

6966.88 --> 6972.2390000000005
the same so like that moist cloud that

6969.92 --> 6975.52
is creating this rainbow effect is

6972.239 --> 6980.0
staying in place as they are descending

6975.52 --> 6981.679
beside it fascinating

6980.0 --> 6984.56
thank you for that link that's a really

6981.679 --> 6984.56
interesting video

6985.84 --> 6989.84
thank you

6999.199 --> 7004.719
how is the rainbow below them well

7001.04 --> 7008.4
that's where the moist is reflecting it

7004.719 --> 7011.52
right moist is breaking it and then

7008.4 --> 7014.32
scattering it in all directions so

7011.52 --> 7017.679
yeah if the moist is below you then the

7014.32 --> 7020.96
rainbow is going to be there

7017.679 --> 7023.76
right because the moist is like

7020.96 --> 7024.32
sort of like a mirror but it breaks it

7023.76 --> 7026.159000000001
up

7024.32 --> 7028.48
so where the moist is that's where the

7026.159 --> 7030.5599999999995
rainbow will manifest

7028.48 --> 7032.5599999999995
now if all the moist is below you then

7030.56 --> 7034.2390000000005
that's where the rainbow manifests is it

7032.56 --> 7035.84
beside you that's where the rainbow

7034.239 --> 7039.839999999999
manifest is it

7035.84 --> 7045.84
like above you then it may

7039.84 --> 7045.84
manifest like right overhead

7058.159 --> 7062.96
yeah i know but iron 26 jedo is that's

7061.119 --> 7065.598999999999
okay

7062.96 --> 7068.96
no but paul curry is not even a troll he

7065.599 --> 7070.96
was just really stubborn and stupid

7068.96 --> 7073.28
although i feel i should unban him

7070.96 --> 7075.679
though

7073.28 --> 7077.119
he was just being a zealot he wasn't

7075.679 --> 7080.4800000000005
really being

7077.119 --> 7082.799999999999
trollish maybe i should unban him

7080.48 --> 7086.4
but i i did want him to basically stop

7082.8 --> 7089.84
yapping it was getting really annoying

7086.4 --> 7100.879999999999
so i will unban him but

7089.84 --> 7102.88
yeah he he better drop the nonsense

7100.88 --> 7104.4800000000005
but yeah jedo has been around for a

7102.88 --> 7107.119
while i've seen both of them

7104.48 --> 7107.119
in chat

7107.76 --> 7112.96
at the same time anyway i am rounding

7111.679 --> 7117.28
out the show it's been

7112.96 --> 7119.44

7117.28 --> 7122.0
