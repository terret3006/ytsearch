227.91 --> 236.01
Roger MC PJ white temporarily banned

233.34 --> 238.5
because he was being really annoying and

236.01 --> 240.92999999999998
he was trying to push subjects on to me

238.5 --> 245.43
that I generally don't like to talk

240.93 --> 247.08
about and probably because in the back

245.43 --> 249.51000000000002
of his mind he thinks that if he can

247.08 --> 252.12
trick me into just talking about that

249.51 --> 254.12
fully I might get a strike because of it

252.12 --> 258.12
because that tends to happen these days

254.12 --> 265.19

389.08 --> 396.46

392.949 --> 400.09000000000003

405.34 --> 413.61999999999995
weekend so I just thought yeah just not

408.159 --> 418.479
not today didn't really get very active

413.62 --> 421.68
but I did watch a lot of things oh yeah

418.479 --> 424.0
I saw Martin's Martin Lee takus

421.68 --> 429.09000000000003
livestream that was very interesting

424.0 --> 429.09
wasn't good was it about again

430.439 --> 441.36
oh yeah yeah just a lot of photos and

435.86 --> 446.639
especially the really crowded ancient

441.36 --> 451.22900000000004
architecture and oh yeah giant painting

446.639 --> 458.099
collections of these eras that was just

451.229 --> 461.419
astounding it's amazing what else did I

458.099 --> 461.419
see oh yeah

462.269 --> 467.899
I don't know media was there what's that

468.509 --> 475.699
oh wait no that was Friday was it yeah

473.37 --> 475.699
No

476.98 --> 479.88
I don't remember

481.01 --> 488.53
oh yeah Owen Benjamin was really good

485.47 --> 490.82000000000005
was hilarious it was at the same time as

488.53 --> 493.46
there were like three streams at the

490.82 --> 496.76
same time was very difficult to keep

493.46 --> 498.96999999999997
track of it all but I catch myself like

496.76 --> 502.09999999999997
multi street yeah multi watching

498.97 --> 504.53000000000003
constantly sometimes four shows at the

502.1 --> 507.08000000000004
same time but not listening but I just

504.53 --> 508.66999999999996
switch around and just see like what's

507.08 --> 511.34
happening in this one does it look

508.67 --> 512.12
interesting and then I'll switch I do

511.34 --> 516.11
that a lot

512.12 --> 519.95
and yesterday was like Nathan Oakley's

516.11 --> 522.86
debate restream martinet cos hang out

519.95 --> 524.57
and Owen Benjamin they were on at the

522.86 --> 525.32
same time and it was all pretty funny

524.57 --> 533.24
and interesting

525.32 --> 536.99
oh yeah continued watching that series

533.24 --> 540.5
that I've been watching on Netflix it's

536.99 --> 543.4
really good it's called the Outlander

540.5 --> 546.94
it's very much yeah it is weird it is

543.4 --> 550.1
historical but it's also with a bit of a

546.94 --> 552.8900000000001
fantasy like science fiction thing

550.1 --> 555.0400000000001
because there's a time-travel component

552.89 --> 557.21
or rather a door between times

555.04 --> 559.8499999999999
apparently it's weird because I've

557.21 --> 562.6700000000001
started watching in the third season so

559.85 --> 564.32
the more I get to see the more figure

562.67 --> 570.62
out like yeah maybe I should watch your

564.32 --> 573.6500000000001
first two seasons it's just so good it's

570.62 --> 576.62
very hard to just break off and go watch

573.65 --> 580.61
another party even but yeah it's it's

576.62 --> 585.8
very it's like a combination of war time

580.61 --> 588.64
and very much romance novel the to my

585.8 --> 592.0
personal taste so I feel a bit like a

588.64 --> 595.17
housewife just gushing over this [ __ ] I

592.0 --> 597.899
find the the lady

595.17 --> 602.16
that is like their to pretty much two

597.899 --> 607.04
main characters Scottish gentleman from

602.16 --> 612.6189999999999
the early times from the Redcoat times

607.04 --> 616.829
around the 1700s and a lady from the

612.619 --> 619.739
from the end of the 20th century it is

616.829 --> 622.41
really it is such a combination but yeah

619.739 --> 626.9290000000001
that lady is a god I'll be fair she

622.41 --> 629.4889999999999
reminds me a lot of my ex-girlfriend

626.929 --> 631.949
even the style and a bit of the way she

629.489 --> 633.989
looks and it's just I'm just gripped by

631.949 --> 636.5999999999999
this and I have to get over that

633.989 --> 639.239
eventually but I think it's a really

636.6 --> 642.48
good series as a story to me personally

639.239 --> 645.269
but also can get a bit long-winded with

642.48 --> 648.679
the romance sometimes but it's also

645.269 --> 654.23
really like brutal harsh realities of

648.679 --> 657.779
war and [ __ ] and extreme genocide and

654.23 --> 661.799
executions it's it almost like as brutal

657.779 --> 664.35
as Game of Thrones at times but not

661.799 --> 668.189
constantly thank God and not everybody

664.35 --> 672.36
you love dies that's a main difference

668.189 --> 675.8389999999999
but it gets pretty damn damn dramatic at

672.36 --> 678.869
times like like really choking Lisa

675.839 --> 681.6
but overall it's amazing in my opinion I

678.869 --> 688.11
love it so I've been watching a lot of

681.6 --> 690.4390000000001
that I hear that oh really outstretch

688.11 --> 690.439
world

691.64 --> 701.49
she is a dude really okay I I think

700.44 --> 706.47
that's ridiculous

701.49 --> 711.24
I think that the main lady character is

706.47 --> 714.24
definitely a woman or yeah that just

711.24 --> 717.42
freaks me out if you know let's let's

714.24 --> 721.25
take that as a Patrol comment anyway I

717.42 --> 721.25
think it's an amazing series and

722.45 --> 727.5200000000001
watching that coming week I think

733.34 --> 746.9
Jesus I don't think I can sprint a

739.73 --> 749.87
hundred miles per hour like my overall

746.9 --> 752.12
physical condition compared to people

749.87 --> 756.44
that train regularly is not that

752.12 --> 759.589
fantastic although my condition for

756.44 --> 761.45
somebody who doesn't um yeah almost

759.589 --> 763.37
doesn't support at all is really good

761.45 --> 767.12
because I eat very healthy and

763.37 --> 769.97
everything I do do like bicycling or

767.12 --> 773.18
walking stairs I do very energetically

769.97 --> 779.4200000000001
so I yeah I'd make a sport out of

773.18 --> 781.9699999999999
everything whenever I can but I don't

779.42 --> 783.41
know I used to be a really good sprinter

781.97 --> 788.12
very explosive

783.41 --> 790.79
but I really do it anymore I'd never

788.12 --> 792.68
have to it's it's it's very weird to do

790.79 --> 794.66
that for me right now but I haven't

792.68 --> 797.89
checked really in a long time but I do

794.66 --> 797.89
know that I have it in me

800.7 --> 812.85
so a weird question alright okay Juan

809.34 --> 813.9200000000001
Carlos I'll try to look up what the name

812.85 --> 816.9200000000001
is

813.92 --> 816.92
si

817.71 --> 820.8090000000001
[Music]

837.74 --> 840.94
[Music]

847.41 --> 850.189
although

854.92 --> 858.0699999999999
come on

858.38 --> 870.98
right when was it yeah okay IMDB is not

868.01 --> 878.36
helping out is it just outline they're

870.98 --> 886.4300000000001
not D let's see all right

878.36 --> 890.48
oh damn that series is 2014 no I I

886.43 --> 893.06
missed out that's yeah that's exactly

890.48 --> 895.46
the time when I broke up with my ex if I

893.06 --> 897.3499999999999
would be watching it I would be and I've

895.46 --> 901.5500000000001
been totally destroyed if I would be

897.35 --> 903.2900000000001
watching it back then so maybe it's good

901.55 --> 914.3
that I missed out on it okay let's see

903.29 --> 920.8299999999999
the actor actors list all right well the

914.3 --> 924.6099999999999
lead character is caitriona belfie as

920.83 --> 924.61
Claire Randall

939.74 --> 947.05
I'll she at least plays a lady in

942.77 --> 947.05
everything she's ever played in so

952.02 --> 961.86
she started acting in 2010 from what I

958.14 --> 967.97
can see so she's pretty she's at it

961.86 --> 967.97
pretty young she's not very old so yeah

968.09 --> 974.4
yeah I thought so Juan Carlos and I find

971.52 --> 976.65
her quite attractive to be fair she has

974.4 --> 981.4499999999999
the same kind of facial and even

976.65 --> 984.6
physical build of my ex who's no sure

981.45 --> 989.3100000000001
though she is very different in many

984.6 --> 991.82
aspects different type of eyes and but

989.31 --> 991.8199999999999
yeah

1005.81 --> 1015.1389999999999
then you'll don't why why do that that's

1011.959 --> 1017.689
really annoying well I put a giant

1015.139 --> 1020.509
message out there and then remove it I

1017.689 --> 1024.86

1020.509 --> 1026.74
weird name that I don't recognize we do

1024.86 --> 1029.7589999999998

1142.98 --> 1151.049

1147.179 --> 1153.3600000000001
regularly just like it's nothing

1151.049 --> 1158.429
hey how are you doing man long time no

1153.36 --> 1160.7099999999998
speak I'm so sick and tired of the

1158.429 --> 1162.51
infighting the consignor people dick

1160.71 --> 1164.039
swinging sick and tired of people on our

1162.51 --> 1165.36
side of the fence not being able to

1164.039 --> 1167.789
accept that all the people may have

1165.36 --> 1169.6789999999999
different opinions and it's totally okay

1167.789 --> 1172.049
because it's still not a sphere and

1169.679 --> 1174.929
we're all allowed to different disagree

1172.049 --> 1178.529
on stuff and it's ringing on our side

1174.929 --> 1184.5
it's just a massive turnoff really don't

1178.529 --> 1186.62
you think it's just like training no I

1184.5 --> 1190.679
think dick swinging is just pure ego

1186.62 --> 1194.6689999999999
well who but when you say dick sorry who

1190.679 --> 1196.1100000000001
you're referring to it specifically I'm

1194.669 --> 1199.1000000000001
not gonna say names cuz I just don't

1196.11 --> 1202.4089999999999
wanna I don't want to glorify why not I

1199.1 --> 1204.12
just don't want to it doesn't benefit

1202.409 --> 1206.88
anybody for different if I itemize

1204.12 --> 1208.08
somebody specific thing traits and we're

1206.88 --> 1212.13
better off talking about it generally

1208.08 --> 1216.84
but do you mean just the other group as

1212.13 --> 1219.48
I would call them the other because

1216.84 --> 1222.84
there are different rifts within the the

1219.48 --> 1225.21
Flat Earth movement as it were fair no

1222.84 --> 1227.37
no very distinctly so and those riffs

1225.21 --> 1229.26
are never gonna be close so yeah there

1227.37 --> 1232.049
will be back and forth infighting at

1229.26 --> 1238.649
times but are you talking about people

1232.049 --> 1241.289
within our yeah protagonist on our side

1238.649 --> 1243.2689999999998
that say things that may or may not be

1241.289 --> 1244.919
true but I'm not open to the possibility

1243.269 --> 1246.1200000000001
that they might be wrong they believe

1244.919 --> 1247.679
that they are right and everybody else

1246.12 --> 1249.57
is wrong even though they can't prove it

1247.679 --> 1251.8200000000002
and it's like well okay

1249.57 --> 1254.759
but why wouldn't you name them because

1251.82 --> 1258.09
isn't that kind of necessary to do that

1254.759 --> 1260.309
not even to floss just not if you give

1258.09 --> 1263.759
them a chance by saying it

1260.309 --> 1265.379
I've tried honest attention I've tried

1263.759 --> 1269.999
I've spoken to them offline and just no

1265.379 --> 1271.619
bets okay well yeah that's see the thing

1269.999 --> 1273.299
is if I don't if I don't name them right

1271.619 --> 1274.9189999999999
what often next week is that we'll put a

1273.299 --> 1279.029
video up claiming ownership of that that

1274.919 --> 1280.47
was talking about him oh you're going

1279.029 --> 1283.08
for the del effect again

1280.47 --> 1284.6390000000001
no no I'm deliberately not mentioning

1283.08 --> 1287.389
names but if I don't mention names

1284.639 --> 1288.9889999999998
they'll respond to it so let me do it

1287.389 --> 1292.799
all right

1288.989 --> 1297.83
okay so yeah I agree all that in felting

1292.799 --> 1299.97
in fighting del is doing all right no no

1297.83 --> 1311.389
well if you want to make it hate video

1299.97 --> 1314.369
del it's fine I have no problem with it

1311.389 --> 1316.109
so where we are any evidence for

1314.369 --> 1320.039
curvature axial rotation gravity

1316.109 --> 1323.099
anything like that no not really

1320.039 --> 1326.82
but I I am getting better at mapping out

1323.099 --> 1328.379
how the structures seem to work in

1326.82 --> 1331.4089999999999
relation to one another so I'm basically

1328.379 --> 1333.119
parallel constructing the systems and

1331.409 --> 1336.3890000000001
I'm getting a lot better at it and

1333.119 --> 1339.2099999999998
getting better oversight even getting

1336.389 --> 1342.359
the ability to on the spot explain it to

1339.21 --> 1345.799
people but it's fine it's difficult

1342.359 --> 1349.32
stuff a momentum of the back shot opened

1345.799 --> 1352.999
hmm how I meant to have back shot open

1349.32 --> 1357.33
nah you could but you don't necessarily

1352.999 --> 1359.729
cool so yeah the panel's also anyone can

1357.33 --> 1361.739
join I got the back yet so don't worry

1359.729 --> 1364.169
about it that's what I was getting at

1361.739 --> 1368.009
should I be doing it over are you on

1364.169 --> 1370.1090000000002
board I am online so Nathan gave birth

1368.009 --> 1371.549
to the day I believe from orbit well

1370.109 --> 1372.629
it's over the Nathan gave birth I

1371.549 --> 1375.119
thought that was quite impressive or

1372.629 --> 1378.809
thought it was Paula that gave birth it

1375.119 --> 1380.07
was Nathan all right I'm pretty sure

1378.809 --> 1381.96
it'll be gutted he's not got a little

1380.07 --> 1383.01
boy I think Nathan wanted to not know

1381.96 --> 1385.8600000000001
the sex cuz he wanted to

1383.01 --> 1393.15
be surprised and I think Macon secretly

1385.86 --> 1395.61
custody he's not got a lot I get it well

1393.15 --> 1398.5500000000002
I just have to try again you know

1395.61 --> 1401.8799999999999
eventually you might get a boy I knew I

1398.55 --> 1405.1499999999999
had the same wrong not me like I knew

1401.88 --> 1407.0700000000002
somebody was 20 years back and more a

1405.15 --> 1409.6200000000001
guy that lived in the street

1407.07 --> 1411.48
oh he run ran a coffee shop in our town

1409.62 --> 1415.59
he was like the only one that had

1411.48 --> 1417.63
permission to do that and he hoped for a

1415.59 --> 1422.9399999999998
little boy as well so yeah he ended up

1417.63 --> 1425.0700000000002
with four daughters and then a boy so he

1422.94 --> 1429.3600000000001
got what he wanted eventually it took

1425.07 --> 1433.47
him like 16 years or something or 18

1429.36 --> 1435.7199999999998
years in total of try but he got to that

1433.47 --> 1439.32
boy eventually so good luck with that

1435.72 --> 1441.09
Nathan I'm just loving how much the

1439.32 --> 1442.62
ballers hate the scientific method when

1441.09 --> 1444.4499999999998
it doesn't support them you know like

1442.62 --> 1446.55
anything the scientific is generally

1444.45 --> 1450.96
credible evidence they don't made it

1446.55 --> 1455.25
they just they just believe that it was

1450.96 --> 1457.44
out done they believe science moved on

1455.25 --> 1459.0
that is their conviction they don't

1457.44 --> 1461.94
understand that that's not the case that

1459.0 --> 1465.9
the scientific apparatus is basically

1461.94 --> 1468.3
resting upon that principle but you know

1465.9 --> 1471.24
the connect oh this is getting lost and

1468.3 --> 1472.86
it's just it's being overlooked you

1471.24 --> 1475.05
don't hear them saying anymore explain

1472.86 --> 1476.4299999999998
sunsets because when you point out to

1475.05 --> 1478.68
them or what's the cause of sunsets

1476.43 --> 1480.3300000000002
earth turn alright so are you gonna

1478.68 --> 1482.01
prove that the earth turning if you've

1480.33 --> 1483.54
got a wiggle it right and obviously they

1482.01 --> 1484.89
don't the can't wiggle it and they

1483.54 --> 1489.21
realized it now so they don't say

1484.89 --> 1492.21
explain sunsets anymore oh well I do

1489.21 --> 1495.72
hear it regularly like seriously there's

1492.21 --> 1498.57
some more dedicated ballers I guess

1495.72 --> 1500.55
people that you like to address a lot of

1498.57 --> 1502.47
the time in when you're on the flat

1500.55 --> 1505.2
earth debates you know these people they

1502.47 --> 1506.76
do keep track and they keep informed

1505.2 --> 1509.42
with one another but there are plenty of

1506.76 --> 1512.15
baller trolls out there that just don't

1509.42 --> 1516.14
pay attention and they keep on saying

1512.15 --> 1519.7800000000002
that same [ __ ] from three years

1516.14 --> 1522.0
yeah and did it's all mix you hear all

1519.78 --> 1524.52
this stupid baller [ __ ] from every

1522.0 --> 1527.7
period every now and then it's always

1524.52 --> 1530.22
the same [ __ ] over and over again have

1527.7 --> 1533.4
you seen the rounds Iglesias video yeah

1530.22 --> 1538.8600000000001
yeah basically that that guy called him

1533.4 --> 1541.74
drawer e5 Grand Challenge I know I

1538.86 --> 1545.01
didn't see that one all right so what

1541.74 --> 1547.71
what's happened is Jim drew draw Ria's

1545.01 --> 1549.39
put out his video is 5 grand requesting

1547.71 --> 1550.92
which I ignored because I didn't want to

1549.39 --> 1552.38
glorify him I didn't want to get

1550.92 --> 1556.02
involved with him because he's just a

1552.38 --> 1557.5800000000002
he's creep in my opinion book and round

1556.02 --> 1559.2
he decided to take it all because he's

1557.58 --> 1561.8999999999999
got his sword now in his house he's got

1559.2 --> 1563.28
in this PC set up and you know he's

1561.9 --> 1564.5400000000002
getting back on track he knows what he's

1563.28 --> 1567.0
doing and he knows how to get stuff done

1564.54 --> 1571.34
and he's getting back straight again so

1567.0 --> 1573.96
he's back on the ball anyway yeah man he

1571.34 --> 1576.24
responded Rory's video which was been

1573.96 --> 1579.39
proved that perspective is not accounted

1576.24 --> 1582.33
for by curve calcs we on the ball Randy

1579.39 --> 1584.46
oh sorry sorry figure of speech I didn't

1582.33 --> 1589.74
mean it no not the fab right I'm just

1584.46 --> 1591.48
that was a Miss speaking life right back

1589.74 --> 1593.49
on the ball and he's winning at life he

1591.48 --> 1595.68
saw it in himself hour now he's moved in

1593.49 --> 1600.24
he's got all his stuff and he's self and

1595.68 --> 1601.65
he's doing good and basically him oh by

1600.24 --> 1603.1200000000001
the way yeah you do have to wiggle

1601.65 --> 1605.22
everything if you don't wiggle it Daniel

1603.12 --> 1607.56
it's not science it's observation only

1605.22 --> 1609.42
there's no such thing as natural science

1607.56 --> 1612.72
mate you can't have it yeah it's out of

1609.42 --> 1616.5
scientific or it's not anyway so he

1612.72 --> 1618.24
responded to it so Rory's claim was that

1616.5 --> 1619.59
I'll give you 5 grand if you can prove

1618.24 --> 1622.02
that the curve cards have not been

1619.59 --> 1624.51
accounting for perspective well there's

1622.02 --> 1626.75
obviously two responses to that one is

1624.51 --> 1628.77
that objects get smaller over distance

1626.75 --> 1630.3
and they don't they don't tell you that

1628.77 --> 1632.82
you need to reduce the height because of

1630.3 --> 1635.79
the apparent size over distance and they

1632.82 --> 1637.6499999999999
allow you to it incorrectly applied the

1635.79 --> 1639.06
curve cards against the absolute height

1637.65 --> 1641.19
which is obviously the point you if I

1639.06 --> 1643.5
see what rumpus with recently to Richard

1641.19 --> 1644.46
but you are absolutely right rompers is

1643.5 --> 1647.34
absolutely wrong

1644.46 --> 1649.02
he's an auto auto auto auto auto [ __ ]

1647.34 --> 1650.6999999999998
and you

1649.02 --> 1652.29
by the curve cuts against the absolute

1650.7 --> 1653.8500000000001
height of the building called the target

1652.29 --> 1655.47
because the absolute height from 30

1653.85 --> 1657.12
miles away has an apparent height it's

1655.47 --> 1659.309
not the absolute height so that's wrong

1657.12 --> 1661.9199999999998
rhombus is wrong from busy selling pork

1659.309 --> 1664.71
pies and so that's that's the first part

1661.92 --> 1668.03
so you could technically do it but the

1664.71 --> 1670.8
thing is is that they simply replace

1668.03 --> 1673.8
perspective based and optics effects

1670.8 --> 1677.76
with that with the obstruction as

1673.8 --> 1680.07
curvature and they they matched how yeah

1677.76 --> 1682.77
they synchronized the optics effects

1680.07 --> 1684.75
with that curvature system it doesn't

1682.77 --> 1688.62
really work out all that well but it

1684.75 --> 1691.05
kind of does sometimes if you tweak it a

1688.62 --> 1692.61
little but the problem is is that the

1691.05 --> 1695.1299999999999
curvature calculator just doesn't have a

1692.61 --> 1697.4699999999998
viewing function because and we

1695.13 --> 1699.75
demonstrated this remember on the flat

1697.47 --> 1702.0
earth debates where I don't remember

1699.75 --> 1705.42
exactly who it was but they put like a

1702.0 --> 1707.61
tall block or like a building and

1705.42 --> 1709.71
another one that was half its size and

1707.61 --> 1713.07
that from the exact distance between

1709.71 --> 1715.44
them from the ground up looked and see

1713.07 --> 1718.32
if that line that in an auto graphic

1715.44 --> 1721.1100000000001
view would be perfectly straight hitting

1718.32 --> 1723.96
from the viewer to the top of the first

1721.11 --> 1725.61
pillar to the second it would hit in a

1723.96 --> 1727.89
straight line in an orthographic view

1725.61 --> 1732.8
but then when he actually did that with

1727.89 --> 1737.0700000000002
a camera it did yeah well because

1732.8 --> 1738.96
perspective changes these things that in

1737.07 --> 1741.6
an auto graphic you just cannot be

1738.96 --> 1744.72
displayed it's impossible because it

1741.6 --> 1747.3
lacks perspective I told him this and

1744.72 --> 1749.94
they didn't even hear it they just moved

1747.3 --> 1751.26
it there are certain points that they

1749.94 --> 1753.15
cannot concede and they were logged for

1751.26 --> 1755.8799999999999
skate to death but anyway I you're right

1753.15 --> 1757.38
and the point is that a rhombus will

1755.88 --> 1760.7700000000002
always obfuscate that point he has to

1757.38 --> 1763.3500000000001
and but obviously Drury Nord Rory is

1760.77 --> 1764.79
quite new to this he's not he's not seen

1763.35 --> 1766.6499999999999
all the debates where we've battled this

1764.79 --> 1768.36
over and over and over again so he's

1766.65 --> 1770.7900000000002
come into it like a little green a green

1768.36 --> 1772.08
newbie guy and then he's basically asked

1770.79 --> 1773.85
the question but he's done it in such a

1772.08 --> 1776.1299999999999
shitty horrible way rather than just

1773.85 --> 1778.5
approached somebody properly like John

1776.13 --> 1780.66
Nathan's panel perhaps and just ask the

1778.5 --> 1782.89
question and and actually listen for the

1780.66 --> 1784.75
answer he's just come up waving his dick

1782.89 --> 1786.0700000000002
and it's like well I'm not gonna get

1784.75 --> 1787.45
involved in that I can't be more

1786.07 --> 1789.01
accountable that he's never ever gonna

1787.45 --> 1790.8700000000001
accept it no matter what you present to

1789.01 --> 1793.179
him and but anywhere and he's took it

1790.87 --> 1795.789
off and he's gotta go now bear in mind

1793.179 --> 1798.909
that he already owes this drawer guy he

1795.789 --> 1801.37
owes good times for all the five grand

1798.909 --> 1804.7
because he's already done it and similar

1801.37 --> 1806.799
point look ranty made but runs he

1804.7 --> 1808.179
demonstrated it better and basically

1806.799 --> 1809.86
what's happened is the metal bunker of

1808.179 --> 1813.5800000000002
calculator was changed about two days

1809.86 --> 1816.61
after he made this video to account for

1813.58 --> 1818.74
at least in some respects the angular

1816.61 --> 1820.899
size and that wasn't there originally

1818.74 --> 1822.909
when he put out his challenge two or

1820.899 --> 1825.9089999999999
three days later and then appears on the

1822.909 --> 1827.769
website and it's almost as if make MIT

1825.909 --> 1830.5
West himself has cotton-like covered for

1827.769 --> 1831.85
him because I mean there's just no point

1830.5 --> 1833.35
in his responding to these people

1831.85 --> 1836.5
because they're never ever ever gonna

1833.35 --> 1839.049
admit that they might be wrong there

1836.5 --> 1840.51
their strategy their real strategy is

1839.049 --> 1844.21
complete isolation

1840.51 --> 1847.059
so they've politicized it up to leftist

1844.21 --> 1850.48
levels and just can say whatever they

1847.059 --> 1852.639
like and they can completely lie about

1850.48 --> 1854.47
it straight in your face and just spin

1852.639 --> 1859.84
around and they'll be applauded by the

1854.47 --> 1863.38
rest yeah but don't take bets ever ever

1859.84 --> 1865.9599999999998
first because they will never pay like

1863.38 --> 1867.6390000000001
flat earthers might be honor few like

1865.96 --> 1870.8500000000001
honorable enough that they should do

1867.639 --> 1875.35
that but don't expect that back because

1870.85 --> 1878.789
ballers don't do that very very rarely

1875.35 --> 1881.59
like zinder for example he may actually

1878.789 --> 1883.96
pay up but no guarantees that he even

1881.59 --> 1887.32
will do that even though he was flashing

1883.96 --> 1891.82
with that money but don't take it for

1887.32 --> 1893.47
granted so will they never do it the

1891.82 --> 1895.1789999999999
other the other issue and this is the

1893.47 --> 1896.95
main reason why I ignored it was because

1895.179 --> 1899.679
although we can literally destroy this

1896.95 --> 1902.0800000000002
guy and by destroying him you publish

1899.679 --> 1905.3200000000002
publicize him and he gets some exposure

1902.08 --> 1907.6899999999998
oh I'm gonna sec

1905.32 --> 1910.8799999999999
[Music]

1907.69 --> 1914.72
let me just message runty I'll send 1z

1910.88 --> 1919.8200000000002
the link the link to the panel you mean

1914.72 --> 1921.14
yeah I do that hold on does the link if

1919.82 --> 1923.78
you copy and paste the link from the top

1921.14 --> 1931.25
does that still work now just let me do

1923.78 --> 1933.56
it got it right here okay all right just

1931.25 --> 1934.97
respondents as you wanna Carlos but

1933.56 --> 1936.5
didn't you written it didn't you been

1934.97 --> 1937.91
Aegon a bet with Marte they're all of

1936.5 --> 1939.68
the being an eclipse every month which

1937.91 --> 1942.23
he didn't prove that he got out the

1939.68 --> 1944.54
opposite way around he could prove what

1942.23 --> 1946.31
them where the moon was right he's gotta

1944.54 --> 1948.74
prove that the moon was passing in front

1946.31 --> 1950.09
of the Sun and nobody can prove that the

1948.74 --> 1952.25
moon is passing in front of the Sun of

1950.09 --> 1954.08
the Eclipse I think that the moon passes

1952.25 --> 1956.06
behind the Sun because we can't

1954.08 --> 1957.77
establish any earth shine there's only

1956.06 --> 1960.32
one person that has ever claimed earth

1957.77 --> 1961.82
shine and it's soundly nobody else all

1960.32 --> 1964.97
over the world can ever prove that the

1961.82 --> 1967.25
moon is there haven't cited this on

1964.97 --> 1969.02
Gerrans channel recently and the moon

1967.25 --> 1971.78
doesn't pass in front of it between the

1969.02 --> 1974.24
Earth and the Sun and the moon seems to

1971.78 --> 1976.01
pass behind it and if marks gonna claim

1974.24 --> 1981.35
that this the moon passes in front of

1976.01 --> 1983.03
the Sun because it we may not even it

1981.35 --> 1984.4099999999999
may not even pass quite close enough to

1983.03 --> 1986.06
it to block the light it might be doing

1984.41 --> 1987.17
somewhere else because then think he

1986.06 --> 1989.12
said that and when you look at it in

1987.17 --> 1990.77
solarium it's not actually accurate to

1989.12 --> 1992.75
where the moon actually is relative to

1990.77 --> 1994.79
what you see in real world but there's a

1992.75 --> 1996.83
query the summer summer about new moon

1994.79 --> 2001.57
phase that's wrong and because you can't

1996.83 --> 2004.78
see the moon and it's not there I that's

2001.57 --> 2006.8799999999999
the observation literally and you

2004.78 --> 2009.43
speculate about its nature but that is

2006.88 --> 2011.65
literally the observation just like we

2009.43 --> 2014.2
have the data about the angular

2011.65 --> 2017.3200000000002
relations of all these things that data

2014.2 --> 2018.6100000000001
is the data and for me the biggest piece

2017.32 --> 2020.26
of thing that's wrong with the claim

2018.61 --> 2022.1799999999998
that then whether there's an eclipse or

2020.26 --> 2024.1
not or whatever goes on at that period

2022.18 --> 2026.2
when there's a solar eclipse is that you

2024.1 --> 2028.06
don't see any casting of a shadow you

2026.2 --> 2029.53
don't see that casting shadow at all it

2028.06 --> 2031.75
should be there we should see a funnel

2029.53 --> 2033.6399999999999
of casting shadow through the sky and we

2031.75 --> 2035.35
just don't see it and that to me is like

2033.64 --> 2036.7900000000002
for me that's the biggest thing that's

2035.35 --> 2038.26
wrong with it but nobody else ever

2036.79 --> 2039.61
mentions that everybody talks about

2038.26 --> 2041.26
whether or not you get earth shine and

2039.61 --> 2043.33
all that and I'm like guys where the

2041.26 --> 2045.04
[ __ ] the Batman figure being cast you

2043.33 --> 2047.35
need that casting right we're not seeing

2045.04 --> 2049.0299999999997
it so for me it's just the absence of

2047.35 --> 2051.7599999999998
light it's not the casting of shadow

2049.03 --> 2053.1400000000003
caused by obstruction it's the removal

2051.76 --> 2055.2400000000002
of the light and it just goes dark

2053.14 --> 2056.95
that's the way I see it well if you want

2055.24 --> 2058.419
to sees you Juan Carlos if you want to

2056.95 --> 2060.0699999999997
see the response go on to my channel

2058.419 --> 2064.06
find the video that's quite all that's

2060.07 --> 2066.429
called my ground the whole eclipse even

2064.06 --> 2071.25
is a fascinating effect by itself have

2066.429 --> 2077.56
you ever seen like a prismatic

2071.25 --> 2080.14
refraction of eclipsing sunlight coyote

2077.56 --> 2082.2999999999997
right and have you ever seen it because

2080.14 --> 2085.39
if you like take a piece of glass that's

2082.3 --> 2087.34
refracting somehow yeah everything that

2085.39 --> 2091.69
shines through it will be exactly

2087.34 --> 2095.11
Eclipse shaped it's like the entire

2091.69 --> 2098.56
light spectrum just changes like what's

2095.11 --> 2100.9900000000002
coming from there it's all becoming like

2098.56 --> 2105.31
hollow beams or it's very weird how

2100.99 --> 2110.7099999999996
there really hurts to me but it's all

2105.31 --> 2112.87
celestial phenomena and our nature tells

2110.71 --> 2115.0
us well that must be something physical

2112.87 --> 2118.0299999999997
because here is a lamp and you can do

2115.0 --> 2119.77
this and it kind of looks alike and thus

2118.03 --> 2121.4500000000003
it must be like that because otherwise

2119.77 --> 2125.86
we just don't understand what the [ __ ]

2121.45 --> 2128.41
that is but yeah yeah we don't know you

2125.86 --> 2130.42
know I think the key reason for why this

2128.41 --> 2131.98
a - is don't look at the Sun masters and

2130.42 --> 2133.51
eclipse is probably because they don't

2131.98 --> 2135.07
want us to see either something that's

2133.51 --> 2136.6000000000004
there there shouldn't be or they don't

2135.07 --> 2138.52
want us to realize that there's no cast

2136.6 --> 2140.14
shadow or there's no moon there for us

2138.52 --> 2141.88
to see earth shine on or some of the

2140.14 --> 2143.89
summer about new moon phase that's dodgy

2141.88 --> 2145.9
as hell and I don't care what the ball

2143.89 --> 2147.8799999999997
is say I'm interested in what they can

2145.9 --> 2149.89
prove and if that's why I'm with Mark

2147.88 --> 2151.69
Taylor claims that the moon passes in

2149.89 --> 2153.25
front of the Sun then we need to be able

2151.69 --> 2154.66
to demonstrate that the moon does pass

2153.25 --> 2157.21
actually in front of the Sun you're

2154.66 --> 2160.2
right you're right I just realized

2157.21 --> 2163.12
something something very serious about

2160.2 --> 2165.91
but yeah about what eclipses should be

2163.12 --> 2167.5499999999997
like hey yellow ranty but I just

2165.91 --> 2170.35
realized something about that

2167.55 --> 2173.11
what we should see the crippled hold on

2170.35 --> 2174.7
think about this if there is a moon

2173.11 --> 2176.65
it would be like a miniature ball

2174.7 --> 2179.29
compared to the Sun way in the distance

2176.65 --> 2181.33
and we'll be moving in front of it or

2179.29 --> 2183.88
there's gonna be light cast onto it so

2181.33 --> 2187.39
you should have a seeing edges of light

2183.88 --> 2189.79
over that moon away from the Sun before

2187.39 --> 2192.2799999999997
it hits and after it hits but you don't

2189.79 --> 2195.7
see it it's perfect perfectly like a

2192.28 --> 2198.1000000000004
black hole yes your light absorbing

2195.7 --> 2200.56
thing moving across that's what it looks

2198.1 --> 2202.42
like you should see a crepuscular shadow

2200.56 --> 2206.08
being cast from the moon crepuscular

2202.42 --> 2209.44
show the Sun on the moon on the sides of

2206.08 --> 2212.23
the moon as it approaches and you don't

2209.44 --> 2220.09
see it anyway runty what you're doing

2212.23 --> 2223.36
hello you changed it whilst are you

2220.09 --> 2225.4
alive right I believe so and however

2223.36 --> 2227.4100000000003
that's not the the point that one of

2225.4 --> 2229.0
folks are one of folks on the point that

2227.41 --> 2231.85
he's actually building the angular size

2229.0 --> 2234.82
part when did he do that it's quite new

2231.85 --> 2238.48
that in it it certainly is when I

2234.82 --> 2243.07
checked on the Wayback Machine I believe

2238.48 --> 2245.29
on the 12th of 12th of March he still

2243.07 --> 2247.77
hadn't been included in angular size and

2245.29 --> 2250.39
I think it was on 26th when we checked

2247.77 --> 2252.78
the wayback machine he'd added it then

2250.39 --> 2256.6
but Rory caught his challenge out on the

2252.78 --> 2262.51
22nd of March so Rory

2256.6 --> 2264.7
yeah Rock drawer II Rory Rory sir so it

2262.51 --> 2266.7400000000002
seems like they're playing catch-up all

2264.7 --> 2267.97
the time doesn't it no what it seems

2266.74 --> 2270.1899999999996
like is that there haven't they're being

2267.97 --> 2272.02
forced by we're putting out the issues

2270.19 --> 2274.51
and the being forced to make their

2272.02 --> 2276.25
calculations match the real world and

2274.51 --> 2278.0800000000004
the button the more they do it the

2276.25 --> 2279.79
better it's gonna get in the long run so

2278.08 --> 2282.19
I appreciate the fact that makes all

2279.79 --> 2283.9
autumn updating his website it's whether

2282.19 --> 2285.31
he's doing it rightly or wrongly at

2283.9 --> 2287.38
least he's trying to account for it it

2285.31 --> 2289.42
seems and but whether he's done the

2287.38 --> 2290.59
correction the correct thing for it or

2289.42 --> 2291.67
not is another matter which we'll have

2290.59 --> 2293.44
to have a look out I've not even looked

2291.67 --> 2295.69
at it I'm I'm aware of it I saw you

2293.44 --> 2298.4500000000003
talking about it and I just realized

2295.69 --> 2300.19
that and the more each alters it the

2298.45 --> 2302.2599999999998
harder it's gonna be for him to explain

2300.19 --> 2304.51
they've hidden because obviously the the

2302.26 --> 2306.73
effect of what he's doing is making that

2304.51 --> 2308.53
object I think the effect of what

2306.73 --> 2310.359
should have done is making that object

2308.53 --> 2312.369
much smaller to drop then into the

2310.359 --> 2314.5
hidden value in which case if that's

2312.369 --> 2316.359
really what's happened it should be the

2314.5 --> 2318.22
case that anything above 20 25 miles

2316.359 --> 2319.33
will always be gone you're never going

2318.22 --> 2323.47
to see any buildings unless the

2319.33 --> 2325.66
mountains because oh you realize now

2323.47 --> 2327.7
that whenever he says anything well

2325.66 --> 2329.7999999999997
whenever Nathan pops out we're in the

2327.7 --> 2332.109
curve calculator does it show that you

2329.8 --> 2334.0600000000004
account because the perspective people

2332.109 --> 2336.369
can now reference Midwest and say well

2334.06 --> 2338.44
there you know is accounted for Mitford

2336.369 --> 2340.03
perspective in his curve calculator okay

2338.44 --> 2342.1
well he may have accounted for it now

2340.03 --> 2343.3
but what about all the observations to

2342.1 --> 2344.38
date that's not been accounted for

2343.3 --> 2345.82
though they're all gonna have to be

2344.38 --> 2347.53
recalculated because I bet you none of

2345.82 --> 2350.0800000000004
them do it properly they'll not fit into

2347.53 --> 2352.4500000000003
the curve carts anymore hold on just

2350.08 --> 2356.5299999999997
because he has angular size included

2352.45 --> 2359.23
doesn't mean that it is genuine he still

2356.53 --> 2362.05
don't have to somehow account for the

2359.23 --> 2364.359
missing curvature somehow work that

2362.05 --> 2367.3900000000003
obstruction in despite the angular sizes

2364.359 --> 2369.8199999999997
so yeah cuz it will just look do with a

2367.39 --> 2372.3689999999997
fine comb and yeah that's right like

2369.82 --> 2376.48
this is yeah here you did this this is

2372.369 --> 2378.4900000000002
where he tweaked it yeah if we're gonna

2376.48 --> 2380.44
look for like a 100 foot building over

2378.49 --> 2382.4799999999996
say 30 miles like a lighthouse over 30

2380.44 --> 2383.859
miles if he's done the curve carts

2382.48 --> 2385.78
properly and he's included in the

2383.859 --> 2387.67
angular size reduction as a function of

2385.78 --> 2390.9100000000003
distance instead of it being a hundred

2387.67 --> 2393.19
for like the absolute height it will be

2390.91 --> 2394.72
100 for 30 miles which is gonna be like

2393.19 --> 2396.82
one point two millimeters or something

2394.72 --> 2398.77
like that and I don't know how he's done

2396.82 --> 2400.3900000000003
it what look at it but basically if you

2398.77 --> 2402.0099999999998
have it right it'll kill the it will

2400.39 --> 2404.41
kill the ball immediately so you don't

2402.01 --> 2406.09
have to know what needs to be addressed

2404.41 --> 2408.52
is the fact well obviously it doesn't do

2406.09 --> 2410.26
all that what you just said it doesn't

2408.52 --> 2413.05
do the functions that I would expect it

2410.26 --> 2415.0
to do for instance if that's supposing

2413.05 --> 2416.8590000000004
you were looking at an object the curve

2415.0 --> 2418.42
calculator the standard refraction I

2416.859 --> 2421.75
said that you should seek one meter of

2418.42 --> 2425.2000000000003
it at 29 miles away yeah so it will have

2421.75 --> 2428.38
a you know an angular size or an arc

2425.2 --> 2432.49
minute at that particular you know that

2428.38 --> 2435.04
you can measure 0.0001 or something to

2432.49 --> 2438.8199999999997
that effect but what that will also show

2435.04 --> 2439.96
is that the the calculation for that is

2438.82 --> 2442.36
so small

2439.96 --> 2444.19
that you wouldn't be able to see it with

2442.36 --> 2445.96
any kind of optics that we have

2444.19 --> 2449.2000000000003
physically and the other we wouldn't be

2445.96 --> 2450.91
able to see it so easily so wait a

2449.2 --> 2454.27
minute so even though the curve can't

2450.91 --> 2456.0099999999998
say that the 1 meter of it is visible

2454.27 --> 2459.0099999999998
because if you look in his curve kalki

2456.01 --> 2461.92
only has visible and hidden so in that

2459.01 --> 2465.0600000000004
there should be a grey area between the

2461.92 --> 2467.59
two where it says although that we can

2465.06 --> 2470.77
you should be able to you should be able

2467.59 --> 2473.8900000000003
to see it 1 meter 2 meter 3 meter the

2470.77 --> 2475.96
the angle is that small with the

2473.89 --> 2477.6099999999997
Rayleigh criterion and it's angular size

2475.96 --> 2481.69
change all the distance that we cannot

2477.61 --> 2483.58
actually see it physically so he needs

2481.69 --> 2485.89
to include that too and this is where

2483.58 --> 2492.31
Ria's challenge breaks down because he

2485.89 --> 2494.41
says you know where does it say that you

2492.31 --> 2496.24
know there's a 5,000 pound challenge for

2494.41 --> 2498.85
anybody that can prove that the curve

2496.24 --> 2501.6699999999996
calx don't include perspective well it

2498.85 --> 2503.86
doesn't because in Midwest's and all of

2501.67 --> 2506.5
them it always just shows hidden and

2503.86 --> 2508.7200000000003
visible there isn't that gray area there

2506.5 --> 2511.09
isn't that gray area that says that if

2508.72 --> 2512.98
you're trying to view something that one

2511.09 --> 2515.02
meter that you can see one meter at the

2512.98 --> 2518.59
top of Blackpool Tower from 29 miles

2515.02 --> 2521.17
away right it is angular size will be

2518.59 --> 2523.21
that small that you cannot see it so to

2521.17 --> 2524.7400000000002
be honest to be honest fronting I think

2523.21 --> 2526.39
what we're doing here is although what

2524.74 --> 2527.89
worth argued about is really credible

2526.39 --> 2529.33
and valid that there's a bigger point

2527.89 --> 2531.31
that we've missed here that you did pick

2529.33 --> 2533.62
up on but you've not given the gravitas

2531.31 --> 2537.07
it deserves he's removed the ball try

2533.62 --> 2540.04
out the curve calculator yes that is a

2537.07 --> 2541.3300000000004
big big big lie that that's like mm I'm

2540.04 --> 2542.92
not sure I'll to describe this other

2541.33 --> 2545.47
than a massive backtrack because that

2542.92 --> 2546.94
bulge does not exist there is no bulge

2545.47 --> 2549.52
that's why he's removed it out he needs

2546.94 --> 2551.65
to make that bulge not be there so that

2549.52 --> 2553.69
it matches it's got more persuasion to

2551.65 --> 2555.1600000000003
match in what we see that bulge is

2553.69 --> 2556.9900000000002
[ __ ] he has to also address the

2555.16 --> 2559.18
horizon distance because the horizon

2556.99 --> 2561.6699999999996
distance is actually male it's just the

2559.18 --> 2563.46
occasion so there and by the way they

2561.67 --> 2566.32
apparently there is sometimes

2563.46 --> 2566.83
oceanic footage there apparently is a

2566.32 --> 2568.6000000000004
bulge

2566.83 --> 2571.12
by the way closer to the coast

2568.6 --> 2573.02
apparently sorry the Kombi when the

2571.12 --> 2575.9
tides coming in fast yeah right

2573.02 --> 2579.08
so it does sometimes happen but oh yeah

2575.9 --> 2581.839
most of it is just obstruction as as a

2579.08 --> 2585.619
part what happens you look out for a

2581.839 --> 2588.589
flat plane limited viewing angle all

2585.619 --> 2590.1800000000003
these effects I don't even know them by

2588.589 --> 2594.56
heart what it all is but it's so much

2590.18 --> 2596.7799999999997
just ask life is short he knows well

2594.56 --> 2598.82
basically I figured it out that if you

2596.78 --> 2601.28
stood in 502 a so if you had an

2598.82 --> 2603.8
elevation of 520 feet and you were

2601.28 --> 2605.78
trying to view Blackpool Tower from 29.3

2603.8 --> 2608.3300000000004
miles away essentially you should see

2605.78 --> 2609.98
one meter of the top of it so even

2608.33 --> 2611.5989999999997
including standard refraction you would

2609.98 --> 2613.22
see one meter at the top of Eiffel

2611.599 --> 2616.2200000000003
Towers let's just say it was the flag

2613.22 --> 2618.6189999999997
let's just say that from from 29th way

2616.22 --> 2622.0099999999998
three miles away you could see the flag

2618.619 --> 2624.56
at the top of Blackpool Tower well yes

2622.01 --> 2627.0200000000004
in their math you can see one meter so

2624.56 --> 2632.56
you can see the flag but because it has

2627.02 --> 2636.83
such a small angular size which is

2632.56 --> 2639.47
0.0001 you wouldn't be able to see it

2636.83 --> 2641.15
with any optics that we have on the

2639.47 --> 2641.4199999999996
earth you wouldn't be able to see it at

2641.15 --> 2643.64
all

2641.42 --> 2645.7400000000002
so where does that show in the

2643.64 --> 2648.2
calculator it doesn't because in the

2645.74 --> 2649.7299999999996
calculator it says invisible one meter

2648.2 --> 2652.22
it doesn't that's what it says

2649.73 --> 2653.9
technically visible 1 meter but it

2652.22 --> 2655.7599999999998
doesn't because you cannot physically

2653.9 --> 2657.53
see it no matter what kind of technology

2655.76 --> 2659.69
you use your eyes

2657.53 --> 2663.53
anything telescopes nothing will see

2659.69 --> 2666.58
that it's too small right so there's my

2663.53 --> 2672.32
5k thank you very

2666.58 --> 2674.68
yeah they're never gonna pay anyway yeah

2672.32 --> 2680.089
it's just enough to pull pull the let go

2674.68 --> 2681.95
right but yeah so yeah they changed the

2680.089 --> 2684.74
balls yeah that was massive because if

2681.95 --> 2686.7799999999997
you remember we were going on about that

2684.74 --> 2689.2999999999997
I think every single show we must have

2686.78 --> 2692.119
said it half a dozen times in you know

2689.3 --> 2694.88
every show going back last year you know

2692.119 --> 2696.83
the ball journey but was this [ __ ]

2694.88 --> 2699.23
order yeah but you have to understand

2696.83 --> 2700.79
that Rory has only come into this quite

2699.23 --> 2702.349
recently he's quite new his knee so he's

2700.79 --> 2704.29
not seeing all that [ __ ] so he's come

2702.349 --> 2707.2000000000003
into it green and thought yeah

2704.29 --> 2709.7799999999997
you're talking about in his smug smarmy

2707.2 --> 2711.1899999999996
creepy what accents he's got and for me

2709.78 --> 2712.48
personally out of just ignore I did

2711.19 --> 2714.46
ignore him because I just didn't want to

2712.48 --> 2716.44
explain want to glorify him in any way

2714.46 --> 2718.33
and but obviously you've picked up on in

2716.44 --> 2719.68
good times for all of them we don't

2718.33 --> 2721.18
really need to mention his name let's

2719.68 --> 2724.0
not mention his name but let's just

2721.18 --> 2725.95
claim that not only is to zero it Zack

2724.0 --> 2728.34
he also was it's a runty as well so it's

2725.95 --> 2728.3399999999997
ten grand

2728.7 --> 2734.23
so so what do you think about MIT West

2731.14 --> 2736.24
changing and adapting not and you you

2734.23 --> 2739.2400000000002
know you in favor of that or do you

2736.24 --> 2742.5099999999998
think it's in direct response to what

2739.24 --> 2745.6
we're doing well yes just realizing that

2742.51 --> 2749.7400000000002
he's wrong but yeah it remains to be

2745.6 --> 2750.7599999999998
seen how did he change it so yeah what

2749.74 --> 2752.47
we've got to look at is what is the

2750.76 --> 2754.57
chain what is the effect of his change

2752.47 --> 2755.95
and does it match the reality of what it

2754.57 --> 2758.11
should do if we did actually live in a

2755.95 --> 2759.46
ball he has to [ __ ] that off right the

2758.11 --> 2761.11
minute he starts accounting for angular

2759.46 --> 2762.64
size he's guy that got off he's gonna

2761.11 --> 2763.33
obfuscate that point so it gets

2762.64 --> 2765.49
confusing

2763.33 --> 2768.34
there's by bad representation of maths

2765.49 --> 2772.0499999999997
or whatever or III could conceptualize

2768.34 --> 2774.94
very roughly how we could apply it

2772.05 --> 2777.2200000000003
without using actually a viewing

2774.94 --> 2779.56
function by basically doing it

2777.22 --> 2781.4199999999996
completely afterwards first doing all

2779.56 --> 2784.63
the autographic rearrangement then

2781.42 --> 2787.6
everything is set and then you translate

2784.63 --> 2791.2000000000003
that literal curvature including thing

2787.6 --> 2793.93
with angular sizes last minute but it

2791.2 --> 2796.3599999999997
could turn out to just not literally

2793.93 --> 2799.06
work out at all I don't know we'll have

2796.36 --> 2799.8900000000003
to see we have to put yeah piece by

2799.06 --> 2803.32
piece

2799.89 --> 2805.45
figure out how it works again mage major

2803.32 --> 2807.25
tom says in chat sleep amore how to tie

2805.45 --> 2808.4199999999996
to work on a flat earth well I can tell

2807.25 --> 2810.04
you out they don't work they've got

2808.42 --> 2811.06
fuck-all to do with the moon sorry oh

2810.04 --> 2813.94
and they've got nothing to do with the

2811.06 --> 2815.35
moon so let's let's rule the moon out as

2813.94 --> 2816.85
the cause of tides cuz that's clearly

2815.35 --> 2818.68
not the case how do they work on a flat

2816.85 --> 2820.27
plane I have no idea I don't know what's

2818.68 --> 2822.94
going on I just realized that the moon's

2820.27 --> 2826.03
got nothing to do with it well there is

2822.94 --> 2829.21
some indication that there's a Electra

2826.03 --> 2832.3900000000003
yeah geo electromagnetic influence

2829.21 --> 2834.43
because of the possible being cold hi

2832.39 --> 2836.68
Robert is your tide map it's it's

2834.43 --> 2837.509
circular it seems to respond just like

2836.68 --> 2841.4089999999997
as if

2837.509 --> 2843.719
electromagnetics would be in those

2841.409 --> 2846.119
locations and it is salt water it's

2843.719 --> 2848.069
owned it's never the sweet water region

2846.119 --> 2852.679
so it's the salt water that is

2848.069 --> 2855.599
influenced and so yeah there is some

2852.679 --> 2858.2090000000003
probably geomagnetic influence that is

2855.599 --> 2860.759
pushing this and you could theorize that

2858.209 --> 2863.8799999999997
that geomagnetic influence is

2860.759 --> 2866.819
synchronized with the moon cycles

2863.88 --> 2867.799
perhaps because the tides do happen

2866.819 --> 2870.269
twice a day

2867.799 --> 2872.849
although there's always some places are

2870.269 --> 2874.709
three times did I so much fall okay well

2872.849 --> 2877.319
then that doesn't make any damn sense

2874.709 --> 2879.469
because the moon transverses in what is

2877.319 --> 2879.469
it

2880.699 --> 2888.599
2025 hours is it so if it comes by if it

2885.329 --> 2890.5190000000002
supposedly comes over once every little

2888.599 --> 2891.989
bit more than one at once every day then

2890.519 --> 2894.3289999999997
how could there be two or even three

2891.989 --> 2896.069
tides doesn't make any damn sense this

2894.329 --> 2898.259
place is out three times and four times

2896.069 --> 2900.359
a day not just too so it's whatever is

2898.259 --> 2902.459
going on with them the tides it's not

2900.359 --> 2905.88
being caused by the moon right because

2902.459 --> 2909.029
there could only be one tide along with

2905.88 --> 2910.949
watching it almost says what's your view

2909.029 --> 2912.989
on the 24-hour Sun in the Arctic that's

2910.949 --> 2915.329
true you can go out to Aberdeen in

2912.989 --> 2917.189
northern Scotland and that's not that

2915.329 --> 2919.409
far south of like the highest points in

2917.189 --> 2921.5389999999998
Norway and they get almost 24 hours

2919.409 --> 2923.699
something's in summer and so yeah there

2921.539 --> 2924.8990000000003
is a 24 hours old in the Arctic and what

2923.699 --> 2926.4590000000003
we haven't got credible enough for

2924.899 --> 2929.3689999999997
evidence to support the assertion that

2926.459 --> 2930.9289999999996
there's not an Antarctic 24 hours on and

2929.369 --> 2934.38
I don't believe there is I don't believe

2930.929 --> 2936.6890000000003
there ever could be well this is because

2934.38 --> 2939.539
we don't 24 hour stream that the only

2936.689 --> 2940.5589999999997
air shows do see now is only yeah listen

2939.539 --> 2942.1490000000003
long enough to drop because I've just

2940.559 --> 2943.529
got a text message off my technician

2942.149 --> 2944.88
I've got a Land Rover technician coming

2943.529 --> 2946.619
to do something to the car and he's like

2944.88 --> 2950.389
gonna be in the next 3 or 4 minutes so

2946.619 --> 2953.2690000000002
I'll have to come back you guys okay

2950.389 --> 2961.589
Dory's bye yeah see you later

2953.269 --> 2964.3689999999997
so Nathan's don't know yeah yeah indeed

2961.589 --> 2967.319
you know you know what she's call oh

2964.369 --> 2969.299
[ __ ] I was gonna give a very terrible

2967.319 --> 2970.72
response to that but I know it's just

2969.299 --> 2973.18
called clover

2970.72 --> 2977.819
clothes they reminded me after life of

2973.18 --> 2981.5789999999997
brian do you know what she is cold but

2977.819 --> 2984.91
let's not get into that actually did not

2981.579 --> 2989.23
name her that well Nathan's definitely

2984.91 --> 2993.819
closer the moon oh it's gonna be a lucky

2989.23 --> 2995.98
charm of course yeah a 3-week is it

2993.819 --> 2997.7799999999997
freely for a for we've fully well

2995.98 --> 3000.869
written it for a leaf clover usually

2997.78 --> 3003.3590000000004
yeah it's pretty cool name

3000.869 --> 3004.98
let's talk about that I don't know I'm

3003.359 --> 3007.47
just one of these people are that you

3004.98 --> 3010.7400000000002
know calling people sky and stuff like

3007.47 --> 3013.0789999999997
that and ya know all this kind of stuff

3010.74 --> 3015.0
I just don't you know not enough found a

3013.079 --> 3019.65
bit really but you know who wants

3015.0 --> 3028.04
themselves as well hmm so you wouldn't a

3019.65 --> 3031.29
mural oh I knew someone that did that

3028.04 --> 3033.9
much in calling you some golem bad

3031.29 --> 3036.5099999999998
that's that's terrible

3033.9 --> 3038.27
although there are some you know there's

3036.51 --> 3041.9700000000003
like this what is it

3038.27 --> 3045.869
the producer for Michael Jackson you

3041.97 --> 3051.569
know what his name was or is go of lie

3045.869 --> 3061.44
or Wow yes well you're naming your kid

3051.569 --> 3063.869
lie or like lyo are yeah what'd he say

3061.44 --> 3067.71
kids look for him a lot of time bullying

3063.869 --> 3070.619
there yeah no not really he's he's like

3067.71 --> 3071.2400000000002
from an elitist family user that doesn't

3070.619 --> 3074.25
matter

3071.24 --> 3079.29
it's not gonna stop kids from from

3074.25 --> 3081.69
poking Foley true true but maybe that's

3079.29 --> 3083.64
just it's just an agitation tactic

3081.69 --> 3088.05
because I don't know the guys probably

3083.64 --> 3089.31
pretty vengeful few anyway let's not get

3088.05 --> 3093.3590000000004
too deep into it but yeah there's some

3089.31 --> 3095.819
crazy names out there and yeah it all

3093.359 --> 3097.56
depends like the parents what kind of

3095.819 --> 3099.93
mood were they in when they were naming

3097.56 --> 3102.99
their child and if your parents were

3099.93 --> 3103.6499999999996
like in the hippy age and they go

3102.99 --> 3106.89
community

3103.65 --> 3109.05
we're so free and drugs and fantasy

3106.89 --> 3115.47
stories then yeah you're gonna get some

3109.05 --> 3118.7400000000002
weird-ass names when I was a kid

3115.47 --> 3120.48
and I only recall it because you know I

3118.74 --> 3122.9399999999996
was I was in hospital a couple of days

3120.48 --> 3125.46
ago I mean some more texts and was

3122.94 --> 3127.4700000000003
talking to this this nurse of the same

3125.46 --> 3130.35
without we just got talking in general I

3127.47 --> 3132.0
don't like needles I absolutely hate me

3130.35 --> 3135.24
if I even look at them you know the

3132.0 --> 3138.06
terrifying me and it all stems back from

3135.24 --> 3140.0699999999997
when I was a kid and I always remember

3138.06 --> 3142.56
order to kid up in this weird I always

3140.07 --> 3144.7200000000003
look back at is it as a dream now I

3142.56 --> 3147.36
understand it was different but in this

3144.72 --> 3149.6699999999996
dream for the entire what seemed like

3147.36 --> 3152.31
the whole night I kept dreaming that I

3149.67 --> 3156.26
kept falling into this vat of needles so

3152.31 --> 3159.2
I was full off this cliff headfirst

3156.26 --> 3162.1200000000003
Endel down into these needles Hannah had

3159.2 --> 3163.68
found first and I would come out and

3162.12 --> 3165.42
I've been looking at these hands covered

3163.68 --> 3167.16
in needles and then I we've got that be

3165.42 --> 3169.29
at the top of the hill again and I fall

3167.16 --> 3173.85
into this path needles again and this

3169.29 --> 3177.0
went on all night long Jesus and when I

3173.85 --> 3180.06
actually came through well well cook

3177.0 --> 3182.55
move around further my auntie rolls my

3180.06 --> 3184.35
mom at that were all around the bed you

3182.55 --> 3187.02
know and they were patting me down with

3184.35 --> 3188.7599999999998
you know with with towels and Stata

3187.02 --> 3192.09
training bringing breaking me out of

3188.76 --> 3194.2200000000003
this hallucination or whatever and I

3192.09 --> 3195.9
walk walk and they obviously I saw them

3194.22 --> 3197.6699999999996
and they went to touch me and give me a

3195.9 --> 3199.08
hug and all I saw was these needles on

3197.67 --> 3201.62
there and you know I was still having

3199.08 --> 3204.21
this you know like no don't touch me

3201.62 --> 3206.31
well I was only like three years old and

3204.21 --> 3209.37
what had happened I found out recently

3206.31 --> 3214.02
what had happened was my uncle Clifton

3209.37 --> 3217.5899999999997
and me my mom they both used to take

3214.02 --> 3219.45
magic mushrooms oh it smells so I've

3217.59 --> 3221.4300000000003
seen them obviously as a child having

3219.45 --> 3224.7599999999998
these magic mushrooms and there are

3221.43 --> 3226.02
thought all sweety's crap these magic

3224.76 --> 3229.59
mushrooms ha

3226.02 --> 3231.09
I've eaten them you know so cause we mom

3229.59 --> 3233.13
knew what the hell is wrong with me

3231.09 --> 3234.619
because you know see she's thinking

3233.13 --> 3237.0190000000002
where the hell are my magic mushrooms

3234.619 --> 3240.38
I'm having this major that's active

3237.019 --> 3241.49
whatever yeah mad [ __ ] it's called a

3240.38 --> 3243.319
bachelor yeah sure

3241.49 --> 3246.2889999999998
I was three years older than most of you

3243.319 --> 3250.22
in the back of magic mushrooms and sit

3246.289 --> 3252.9500000000003
back but magic mushrooms tastes really

3250.22 --> 3257.9599999999996
disgusting so I wonder I think you just

3252.95 --> 3260.1189999999997
took a piece and just like um yeah but

3257.96 --> 3263.329
it's a not it can be look when you're

3260.119 --> 3267.829
three okay yeah just the tiniest bit can

3263.329 --> 3270.4100000000003
just set off sexual big time so it

3267.829 --> 3273.529
happened to me when I was five I told

3270.41 --> 3276.98
you this I think I told it when I was

3273.529 --> 3280.369
five my mother was in this weird ritual

3276.98 --> 3282.619
thing I guess I don't know I don't even

3280.369 --> 3285.799
retrospect I don't even know if this was

3282.619 --> 3288.7400000000002
physical experience but I remember like

3285.799 --> 3290.9
seeing this bowl with this gooey which

3288.74 --> 3295.279
in retrospect was probably ayahuasca or

3290.9 --> 3297.9500000000003
something and yeah the guy telling

3295.279 --> 3299.839
telling my mother like stay out of that

3297.95 --> 3301.5789999999997
like are you sure it's safe with your

3299.839 --> 3304.16
kid around and she's like yeah yeah yeah

3301.579 --> 3306.349
yeah and I was getting sneaky and I

3304.16 --> 3308.5389999999998
basically dipped my finger in it when he

3306.349 --> 3311.42
wasn't looking and just did that and

3308.539 --> 3314.2690000000002
that's completely set off a whole chain

3311.42 --> 3315.89
reaction of weird experience and that

3314.269 --> 3318.519
was when I was five after that I

3315.89 --> 3321.19
remember having lots of dark world

3318.519 --> 3325.029
experiences naturally

3321.19 --> 3330.71
so yeah you ate a piece of mushroom and

3325.029 --> 3333.559
I dip my finger in ayahuasca right so um

3330.71 --> 3335.7200000000003
fee you know in my team at be onto

3333.559 --> 3337.7000000000003
something here he says with undeniable

3335.72 --> 3344.8689999999997
reason why people believe in baller

3337.7 --> 3348.019
brain damage what sorry

3344.869 --> 3353.1400000000003
oh it's just a fact oh hey it's just

3348.019 --> 3356.8999999999996
reality you know mm like yeah we yes

3353.14 --> 3359.45
nice to see you yeah how did you like

3356.9 --> 3363.21
the beat

3359.45 --> 3366.75
black hole photographs that we recently

3363.21 --> 3370.59
were were released oh you mean the fake

3366.75 --> 3372.51
black hole fake it wasn't real watch it

3370.59 --> 3374.25
was a real blotch of light there's

3372.51 --> 3376.2900000000004
nothing fake about that you know it's

3374.25 --> 3379.56
like how do you know it's fake well

3376.29 --> 3382.86
how'd you know Israel well how do you

3379.56 --> 3386.5499999999997
know that's a black hole it was a blotch

3382.86 --> 3387.63
of light there was a hole in the center

3386.55 --> 3389.79
oh really

3387.63 --> 3392.81
so it could have been an eclipse perhaps

3389.79 --> 3396.11
because those have holes in the center

3392.81 --> 3399.7799999999997
no it's not an eclipse oh really

3396.11 --> 3403.35
why not it had a hole in the center

3399.78 --> 3407.0600000000004
didn't it you know why they haven't

3403.35 --> 3409.7999999999997
spotted black holes so far you know why

3407.06 --> 3411.66
because they're black because they're

3409.8 --> 3413.61
black they suck all the light into them

3411.66 --> 3417.06
there's nothing that's gonna come off it

3413.61 --> 3419.33
there's none gonna bleed a halo yeah and

3417.06 --> 3423.42
they don't actually suck light in oh

3419.33 --> 3425.0699999999997
really oh really oh so light really what

3423.42 --> 3427.4700000000003
can what they do is kiss sport really

3425.07 --> 3429.1800000000003
the distort light that's going by them

3427.47 --> 3432.18
and you can see them are the effects

3429.18 --> 3435.8399999999997
they caused oh so it has to be in front

3432.18 --> 3438.81
of something else like an eclipse so it

3435.84 --> 3441.9300000000003
could have been just a a large physical

3438.81 --> 3444.5099999999998
body supposedly like an eclipse getting

3441.93 --> 3446.6099999999997
in front of a Sun not relatively too

3444.51 --> 3448.2000000000003
distant from that like an eclipse oh

3446.61 --> 3451.8900000000003
it's not proof that it's a black hole

3448.2 --> 3453.5099999999998
it's just a blotch blob and you know it

3451.89 --> 3455.6099999999997
was just declared a black hole it's

3453.51 --> 3458.7000000000003
declared a black hole in reality it's

3455.61 --> 3460.32
just a yeah a blotch along what evidence

3458.7 --> 3462.33
do you have that it's not a black hole

3460.32 --> 3465.3300000000004
or it's a blotch of lights

3462.33 --> 3468.14
you have no evidence that it is except

3465.33 --> 3468.14
for a declaration

3468.71 --> 3473.43
yeah just disbelieving something just

3471.36 --> 3476.82
because isn't like a rational response

3473.43 --> 3478.89
the thing is is that you know it's the

3476.82 --> 3481.44
start it starts where's the evidence

3478.89 --> 3484.2
that it is a black hole your red herring

3481.44 --> 3486.42
me know they they have yeah they will ha

3484.2 --> 3488.5499999999997
Bush considerable evidence they've come

3486.42 --> 3491.04
on you know really it's based on the

3488.55 --> 3492.53
analysis that blotch of lights and all

3491.04 --> 3495.94
the CGI in half

3492.53 --> 3499.3100000000004
hence mints that came out of it right

3495.94 --> 3501.17
so they base all their data and their

3499.31 --> 3502.99
interpretations on the blotch of light

3501.17 --> 3506.81
and they declare that's a black hole

3502.99 --> 3508.52
that's nice oh really oh really so how

3506.81 --> 3512.93
did they determine it was a black hole

3508.52 --> 3515.33
that they point their gravimeter ray at

3512.93 --> 3517.91
it and then so there's so much gravity

3515.33 --> 3520.34
over there must be black oh oh is that

3517.91 --> 3524.3599999999997
what they did or did they just not when

3520.34 --> 3529.1600000000003
the life to blot you light what they did

3524.36 --> 3531.6800000000003
was analyze data from the bloodline from

3529.16 --> 3533.21
many different radio telescopes these

3531.68 --> 3536.8399999999997
are tape this was taken with radio

3533.21 --> 3541.04
telescopes are one right this is a radio

3536.84 --> 3544.25
watches of lights and yeah no look

3541.04 --> 3546.41
there's all the same picture it was

3544.25 --> 3549.11
taken with a radio telescope Arwen oh

3546.41 --> 3552.3199999999997
really so what kind of data did that

3549.11 --> 3556.85
provide regular radio signal escape a

3552.32 --> 3561.59
black hole you tell me it can't exactly

3556.85 --> 3565.58
show enter a black hole or past a black

3561.59 --> 3568.1600000000003
hole into the vastness of space radio

3565.58 --> 3572.06
signals should not be able to register

3568.16 --> 3574.73
any kind of black hole so that's right

3572.06 --> 3577.16
so how did they have what kind of data

3574.73 --> 3580.1
from radio signals if you're gonna

3577.16 --> 3584.39
provide Avenue or a black hole Brenda by

3580.1 --> 3587.33
the affected has around if you know that

3584.39 --> 3591.2599999999998
space when if you notice Brenda came on

3587.33 --> 3592.97
and Brenda called it a photograph if you

3591.26 --> 3596.1800000000003
would have read the article it's not a

3592.97 --> 3598.6699999999996
photograph yeah they're easy they're

3596.18 --> 3601.1299999999997
easy but you called it a photograph no

3598.67 --> 3603.86
but they're not but there is like

3601.13 --> 3606.4700000000003
photograph no there is a lot of oh I

3603.86 --> 3608.4500000000003
know it's not a photograph it's an image

3606.47 --> 3610.49
but you called it a photograph we have

3608.45 --> 3610.8799999999997
that's Ryder's let's use the right

3610.49 --> 3613.8799999999997
whatever

3610.88 --> 3617.35
hold on there well yes it's image taken

3613.88 --> 3620.21
by radio telescopes I already said that

3617.35 --> 3624.68
okay you called it a photograph yes

3620.21 --> 3626.54
that's fine I understand just do you

3624.68 --> 3627.95
think that the photograph

3626.54 --> 3631.88
you take with your cameras is a

3627.95 --> 3633.6699999999996
photograph I'm not making any claims you

3631.88 --> 3636.23
came on here and made a claim all right

3633.67 --> 3639.65
so the image that you take with your

3636.23 --> 3642.94
camera is assembled from three separate

3639.65 --> 3647.4500000000003
images right and it's assembled it's

3642.94 --> 3652.64
composited right so it wasn't it was a

3647.45 --> 3654.7999999999997
radio view image yes yes okay goody but

3652.64 --> 3658.94
that doesn't make any damn sense because

3654.8 --> 3661.46
a radio view it should not be able it

3658.94 --> 3664.3
should be able to register anything

3661.46 --> 3671.54
about that black hole as you just

3664.3 --> 3674.09
confirm sure you just said it I just

3671.54 --> 3675.8
said like radio signals should be

3674.09 --> 3678.2000000000003
completely absorbed by black holes

3675.8 --> 3680.54
everything surrounding a black hole is

3678.2 --> 3682.91
gonna be space because all the matter is

3680.54 --> 3685.1
being sucked into the black hole so

3682.91 --> 3688.64
there shouldn't be any way to register

3685.1 --> 3690.89
any difference of a black hole being

3688.64 --> 3693.1099999999997
present or not because the signals are

3690.89 --> 3695.8399999999997
absorbed it doesn't make any sense true

3693.11 --> 3698.03
are one black holes distort the space

3695.84 --> 3701.75
around them and you can see those

3698.03 --> 3703.55
effects oh really yeah

3701.75 --> 3706.37
oh really so how does it distort the

3703.55 --> 3708.26
space around him and that radio signal

3706.37 --> 3711.2
how would their real because of its

3708.26 --> 3714.6200000000003
incredibly strong gravity how is thus

3711.2 --> 3716.29
that how does gravity influence radio

3714.62 --> 3721.2799999999997
signals

3716.29 --> 3725.23
it doesn't yes it does oh really those

3721.28 --> 3728.84
radio signals radio signals are light

3725.23 --> 3734.63
right and oh really are gravity bends

3728.84 --> 3737.6600000000003
light wow that is the worst consecutive

3734.63 --> 3739.79
science fiction explanation technobabble

3737.66 --> 3742.25
[ __ ] I've ever heard you utter

3739.79 --> 3745.55
you've never heard this before I want

3742.25 --> 3748.25
redic it's ridiculous the gravity

3745.55 --> 3750.6800000000003
doesn't influence light it doesn't

3748.25 --> 3752.6
influence radio signals you have no

3750.68 --> 3754.6699999999996
principles you have no proof of that

3752.6 --> 3757.91
yes we have we've had proof for over a

3754.67 --> 3761.0
hundred years you mean theoretical proof

3757.91 --> 3762.77
so through ice theory and that

3761.0 --> 3767.26
kind of speculation there is no proof

3762.77 --> 3769.88
that light that light is bent by gravity

3767.26 --> 3772.73
proof for gravity you don't even have

3769.88 --> 3774.77
scientific you know you didn't long had

3772.73 --> 3780.26
proof of gravity and we've long had

3774.77 --> 3785.17
proof that nor any space around masses

3780.26 --> 3789.2900000000004
and alters the course of light [ __ ]

3785.17 --> 3791.81
disbelief no no and it's not disbelief

3789.29 --> 3794.9
it's [ __ ] it's not true yeah that's

3791.81 --> 3796.19
that's just this gravity doesn't bend it

3794.9 --> 3800.33
lies matter

3796.19 --> 3803.18
bends light right atmosphere can bends

3800.33 --> 3807.68
lights like us matter has crabbin know

3803.18 --> 3810.29
because matter has lights influencing or

3807.68 --> 3814.3999999999996
breaking properties that's why it does

3810.29 --> 3817.849
oh no not gravity that's freaking optics

3814.4 --> 3826.28
has nothing to do with force force

3817.849 --> 3829.19
applies to matter okay not light get

3826.28 --> 3831.4300000000003
back to slightly you [ __ ] get back to

3829.19 --> 3833.75
school doesn't make any damn sense

3831.43 --> 3837.5
gravity is a force it's supposed to

3833.75 --> 3841.22
influence matter not light it's [ __ ]

3837.5 --> 3844.849
it influences light because it bends the

3841.22 --> 3849.47
space-time around it that's all

3844.849 --> 3851.98
science fiction [ __ ] oh you have no

3849.47 --> 3855.14
physical evidence of this you just

3851.98 --> 3857.06
speculation look all this photo graph

3855.14 --> 3858.77
can we bring it back

3857.06 --> 3860.27
Oh in the mass sharing stream yeah you

3858.77 --> 3863.65
are you have been for a while Brett

3860.27 --> 3866.47
Brenda can you look at this image

3863.65 --> 3870.05
congratulations you can use Photoshop oh

3866.47 --> 3873.3199999999997
wait a minute wait a minute do you see

3870.05 --> 3876.19
how how much did they cost to get this

3873.32 --> 3883.28
image how much did they say it cost I

3876.19 --> 3885.17
don't know yeah taking an image and

3883.28 --> 3889.849
using Photoshop doesn't prove anything

3885.17 --> 3891.83
about it it doesn't prove that it's

3889.849 --> 3894.07
really easy to fake doesn't it prove

3891.83 --> 3894.0699999999997
that

3894.77 --> 3900.63
come on Brenda what's the point you're

3897.9 --> 3904.56
making aunty what do you think of the

3900.63 --> 3906.6800000000003
image that I'm showing it then it's a

3904.56 --> 3909.87
ham-fisted attempt at Photoshop and

3906.68 --> 3913.7999999999997
satire right so you don't think that

3909.87 --> 3916.29
this you're being told you're being told

3913.8 --> 3920.2200000000003
that this image right this image has

3916.29 --> 3923.55
been created using what how much money

3920.22 --> 3926.1
how many people I don't know right

3923.55 --> 3928.4100000000003
billions and billions I would imagine to

3926.1 --> 3932.91
get this image now that billions I'm

3928.41 --> 3935.04
sure many there I don't know you tell me

3932.91 --> 3937.92
well or than what you're the one with

3935.04 --> 3940.74
the Photoshop no no this is you're

3937.92 --> 3943.11
telling me that this is real this is not

3940.74 --> 3945.6
so you're telling me that this goal and

3943.11 --> 3948.09
that says it through there are so many

3945.6 --> 3950.7599999999998
ways you can get this image that you

3948.09 --> 3953.76
don't crafter you're right yeah there

3950.76 --> 3955.11
are you right you know everything that's

3953.76 --> 3961.71
caught that doesn't prove anything

3955.11 --> 3963.4500000000003
aren't ranty what is that supposed to

3961.71 --> 3966.18
prove the fact that you could do use

3963.45 --> 3970.08
Photoshop what about this myocardial

3966.18 --> 3971.97
perfusion images right back into the DNA

3970.08 --> 3974.16
look at this look at how these look

3971.97 --> 3976.41
right now this is you can sure you can

3974.16 --> 3978.3199999999997
search this these have been up for years

3976.41 --> 3981.33
on the inside these haven't been

3978.32 --> 3984.51
doctored in any way shape or form but

3981.33 --> 3987.96
look how look how look how they compare

3984.51 --> 3989.3900000000003
to this look how the compare would you

3987.96 --> 3992.73
say they're pretty close

3989.39 --> 3995.7
or is it you've contrived similar images

3992.73 --> 3997.65
for anything what is this that doesn't

3995.7 --> 4000.08
prove anything up these are these are

3997.65 --> 4002.09
myocardial perfusion images the Hallett

4000.08 --> 4005.21
right or what this is the image of the

4002.09 --> 4007.9700000000003
black hole so what it proves that the

4005.21 --> 4010.88
black hole image could be anything it's

4007.97 --> 4014.18
just yeah it could be anything it could

4010.88 --> 4016.4
literally be anything how how does it if

4014.18 --> 4018.83
they produced it in a way that rather

4016.4 --> 4021.7400000000002
than to reproduce it so how does it

4018.83 --> 4024.23
prove how does it prove what they're

4021.74 --> 4024.6499999999996
showing you is true we hear that when

4024.23 --> 4026.9
they

4024.65 --> 4028.37
the images Ryu there will be protesting

4026.9 --> 4031.04
with you that who are the people that

4028.37 --> 4037.12
actually presents this this evidence to

4031.04 --> 4040.22
you um scientists scientists we there

4037.12 --> 4043.31
know so you're taking their word for it

4040.22 --> 4044.8399999999997
yes yes so when I show an image like

4043.31 --> 4048.23
this and I say that this is very

4044.84 --> 4050.9
comparable to an image like this and I

4048.23 --> 4054.5
suggest I suggest that it could also be

4050.9 --> 4056.78
a fake image that they put out why would

4054.5 --> 4059.81
you suddenly go to their defense and say

4056.78 --> 4061.46
no when because obviously there are

4059.81 --> 4063.74
other other things that look very

4061.46 --> 4065.9900000000002
similar that they could have taken and

4063.74 --> 4067.97
used for this and isn't the first time

4065.99 --> 4071.0899999999997
that they've done this very may remember

4067.97 --> 4074.48
the ISS Foyle remember the hole in the

4071.09 --> 4077.33
ISS yes exactly respond again because

4074.48 --> 4080.66
finding a similar image doesn't show

4077.33 --> 4090.38
that there's this is fake well holding

4080.66 --> 4092.99
the ISS the shining similar doing a

4090.38 --> 4095.7200000000003
google search and finding images similar

4092.99 --> 4098.84
to another image doesn't show knots or

4095.72 --> 4101.96
proof that those images are from are

4098.84 --> 4105.05
from the same source this is the hole in

4101.96 --> 4110.21
the ISS image was not similar

4105.05 --> 4112.37
it was hundred I don't know what I do it

4110.21 --> 4115.07
oh yeah but where this is coming from

4112.37 --> 4119.36
the same group of people basically no

4115.07 --> 4121.4
it's not yeah it is no it's not yes no

4119.36 --> 4124.009999999999
it isn't oh really so it's not coming

4121.4 --> 4126.95
from NASA they're not on the ISS it's

4124.01 --> 4131.93
not yes it's about the group of people

4126.95 --> 4134.03
they're not the same or plan what are

4131.93 --> 4136.7300000000005
you talking about burn down doesn't

4134.03 --> 4137.83
matter yes Brendan so I'm gonna ask you

4136.73 --> 4141.139999999999
a serious question

4137.83 --> 4145.55
okay now give me an honest answer okay

4141.14 --> 4148.76
how does this radio image of this black

4145.55 --> 4152.09
hole how does this help humanity give me

4148.76 --> 4154.31
a good it helps us to understand the

4152.09 --> 4157.33
world around us which is good for

4154.31 --> 4157.330000000001
Humanity how

4157.359 --> 4164.029
how dare you understand why were around

4161.96 --> 4166.339
you how does it help you to understand

4164.029 --> 4168.77
the world around you by supporting your

4166.339 --> 4170.239
science fiction claims of gravity and

4168.77 --> 4172.369000000001
how that's supposed to influence

4170.239 --> 4177.848999999999
everything by reinforcing their religion

4172.369 --> 4180.44
it does it help it like that by reify

4177.849 --> 4182.4800000000005
reading our knowledge of how the

4180.44 --> 4185.48
physical world around right while

4182.48 --> 4188.089
reinforcing your religious doctrine

4185.48 --> 4190.218999999999
that's right yeah science is religion

4188.089 --> 4194.659
Darwin now that's right it's a method a

4190.219 --> 4197.4800000000005
method that you and your scientism cult

4194.659 --> 4200.78
out there that religion does not abide

4197.48 --> 4203.03
to well calling science a cult doesn't

4200.78 --> 4205.55
make it one no it's a religion it's a

4203.03 --> 4208.61
it's a religion literally and

4205.55 --> 4211.219
figuratively it's a world religion just

4208.61 --> 4213.83
same things doesn't make them so larwin

4211.219 --> 4216.65
no that's right but explaining exactly

4213.83 --> 4217.48
why does and we have done explain a lot

4216.65 --> 4221.57
of themes

4217.48 --> 4224.78
many things why is it a religion explain

4221.57 --> 4228.29
explain to me why it is gosh you don't

4224.78 --> 4231.4
base because it's following you is

4228.29 --> 4235.099
because you don't base your allure on

4231.4 --> 4237.5599999999995
actual scientific facts but on modeling

4235.099 --> 4240.110000000001
and those models don't really work out

4237.56 --> 4243.860000000001
and you sphere now spend most of your

4240.11 --> 4246.949
time red herring and psychological

4243.86 --> 4247.94
warfare deviation [ __ ] straw Manning

4246.949 --> 4250.969
peer pressure

4247.94 --> 4252.949
that's the tactical source that is being

4250.969 --> 4255.8
delved into because it's the only ground

4252.949 --> 4258.138999999999
you can delve into because the actual

4255.8 --> 4260.42
doctrine itself and the belief that the

4258.139 --> 4263.42
earth is a globe is so riddled with

4260.42 --> 4265.31
holes dove model is so damn broken there

4263.42 --> 4267.65
are so many housekeeping questions that

4265.31 --> 4270.080000000001
you can't answer or you can answer it

4267.65 --> 4271.79
but not in a sensical way not in a way

4270.08 --> 4274.369
that scriptural response to the

4271.79 --> 4278.05
questions or that makes any logical

4274.369 --> 4279.889
sense beyond weird science fiction

4278.05 --> 4282.650000000001
dissonant stories

4279.889 --> 4286.04
besides that you don't know anything so

4282.65 --> 4288.469
yeah you spend much time just learning

4286.04 --> 4288.679
how to rumpus people how to red herring

4288.469 --> 4290.809
there

4288.679 --> 4293.51
strawman than and how to apply peer

4290.809 --> 4299.59
pressure and what is the main focus of

4293.51 --> 4299.59
your religious occupation these days so

4299.86 --> 4306.469
this is my show Brenda this is my show

4303.679 --> 4308.329
if I feel like rum passing I will rumpus

4306.469 --> 4311.479
because this is my show

4308.329 --> 4313.88
deal with it yeah yeah I don't care no

4311.479 --> 4318.969
you will care because if I feel like

4313.88 --> 4323.119
talking you then I will yes I asked you

4318.969 --> 4325.88
to explain to me why you think that

4323.119 --> 4329.268999999999
science is a religion and you can't do

4325.88 --> 4332.929
it science isn't a religion science is a

4329.269 --> 4335.389
method and what you say is science in a

4332.929 --> 4338.479
weird colloquial way is a religion

4335.389 --> 4340.639
because it doesn't actually abide by the

4338.479 --> 4343.4890000000005
original foundations of what science

4340.639 --> 4346.639
Houston supposed to bypass is the

4343.489 --> 4349.759999999999
scientific method and invents new ways

4346.639 --> 4351.619
of dealing with science by passing a

4349.76 --> 4354.05
scientific method and then making up

4351.619 --> 4357.139
giant amounts of science fiction stories

4354.05 --> 4358.689
I can give you an answer tonight yeah

4357.139 --> 4362.499
there you go

4358.689 --> 4365.119000000001
so like basically it seems like

4362.499 --> 4368.989
scientists today what you would identify

4365.119 --> 4373.759999999999
as a scientist went from hypothesis

4368.989 --> 4376.249
straight to theory right they skip that

4373.76 --> 4380.209
middle part and they just make a

4376.249 --> 4385.699
declaration right and that seems like a

4380.209 --> 4390.499
religion wouldn't it - you can nobody

4385.699 --> 4394.509999999999
hear me I hear you the scientific method

4390.499 --> 4398.659
is you make observations you formulate a

4394.51 --> 4402.499
hypothesis you test predictions based on

4398.659 --> 4406.339999999999
your hypothesis right and you repeat

4402.499 --> 4409.13
that over and over over time you can

4406.34 --> 4411.969
develop a theory to explain your

4409.13 --> 4411.969
observations

4412.18 --> 4417.04
that's the scientific so you're not

4415.09 --> 4419.74
gonna prove anything are you

4417.04 --> 4423.19
it's just a desire so science itself

4419.74 --> 4424.8099999999995
he's an abductive theorizing and you

4423.19 --> 4427.599999999999
don't sign for anything do you prove

4424.81 --> 4430.81
anything with that approach of science

4427.6 --> 4432.76
method doesn't prove things right so

4430.81 --> 4434.9800000000005
yeah you have no proof it's just

4432.76 --> 4438.25
theorizing and just a circle jerk

4434.98 --> 4440.429999999999
reinforcement oh yes it is because you

4438.25 --> 4443.5
just said it doesn't prove anything

4440.43 --> 4445.87
correct well what's this box of points

4443.5 --> 4449.29
how is it any kind of authority if it

4445.87 --> 4453.19
doesn't even prove anything it makes it

4449.29 --> 4456.87
makes inductive not deductive Candido

4453.19 --> 4463.719999999999
this probabilistic so it's probabilistic

4456.87 --> 4466.96
right so the probability of a scientific

4463.72 --> 4470.14
theory increases but it never reaches

4466.96 --> 4472.69
absolute certainty like mathematics does

4470.14 --> 4476.77
we know with absolute certainty that two

4472.69 --> 4480.2699999999995
plus two equals four right but Newton

4476.77 --> 4484.06
couldn't be absolutely sure that his

4480.27 --> 4486.64
gravitational formulas were 100% certain

4484.06 --> 4490.6900000000005
and Einstein came along and showed that

4486.64 --> 4494.2300000000005
he was wrong and even today two formulas

4490.69 --> 4497.469999999999
were definitely right but he didn't

4494.23 --> 4499.99
claim a hypothesis because he knew your

4497.47 --> 4502.54
move yes he knew here but he couldn't

4499.99 --> 4505.03
use the scientific method on it which

4502.54 --> 4507.43
was still very efficient in that time

4505.03 --> 4510.75
the scientific method was still very

4507.43 --> 4514.3
important they hadn't discarded it yet

4510.75 --> 4518.38
so he did not claim a hypothesis which

4514.3 --> 4520.99
is obviously registered that he said

4518.38 --> 4524.1
that it is quoted he did not clear

4520.99 --> 4527.349999999999
hypotheses for gravity because back then

4524.1 --> 4529.96
everyone was still being upheld in the

4527.35 --> 4533.83
standard of the scientific method they

4529.96 --> 4536.95
were because it was that time later they

4533.83 --> 4539.47
discarded that then science became

4536.95 --> 4540.94
parochial it became a colloquial thing

4539.47 --> 4543.280000000001
and people could just make up whatever

4540.94 --> 4545.36
they liked theorized about it have no

4543.28 --> 4547.79
actual proof using the real

4545.36 --> 4550.639
scientific method and just believe

4547.79 --> 4552.5
whatever they like what what does our

4550.639 --> 4554.96
what do modern scientists get wrong

4552.5 --> 4557.869
about the scientific method they don't

4554.96 --> 4561.08
apply it anymore no but what do they get

4557.869 --> 4562.699
wrong about it everything it doesn't

4561.08 --> 4564.65
fight that's what an independent

4562.699 --> 4566.15
variable it doesn't have a controlled

4564.65 --> 4570.259999999999
variable it doesn't have a null

4566.15 --> 4572.0
hypothesis it doesn't is not scientific

4570.26 --> 4574.13
about it anymore the scientific method

4572.0 --> 4577.28
is very specific you can have complex

4574.13 --> 4579.53
hypotheses on top of that but we all

4577.28 --> 4581.869
will have to rest off to the original

4579.53 --> 4585.71
scientific method which is very narrow

4581.869 --> 4587.2699999999995
it's very specific and naturally just

4585.71 --> 4589.13
saying people get it wrong isn't

4587.27 --> 4590.06
anything how do they get it wrong

4589.13 --> 4592.159000000001
exactly

4590.06 --> 4595.34
well what you explained to me the

4592.159 --> 4599.48
scientific method just now it was wrong

4595.34 --> 4600.71
it missed a critical parts conjecture it

4599.48 --> 4604.459999999999
didn't prove anything

4600.71 --> 4607.969
it didn't even have a proving function

4604.46 --> 4612.86
which the scientific method does the

4607.969 --> 4618.32
same sets out to prove the cause of an

4612.86 --> 4621.799999999999
effect in an observation it calls out

4618.32 --> 4623.239
Brenda Yellin your string you write our

4621.8 --> 4625.9400000000005
web it's because you're all for talking

4623.239 --> 4628.009999999999
me you know the all the alternative is

4625.94 --> 4629.928999999999
your eyes fill about yours you're

4628.01 --> 4631.85
wanting you want me to kick you out cuz

4629.929 --> 4634.28
you're gonna keep on over talking me or

4631.85 --> 4636.9490000000005
are you just gonna let me explain things

4634.28 --> 4639.139
not yelling what do you want I would

4636.949 --> 4640.909
like you to explain but you just ran -

4639.139 --> 4644.81
yeah but that's because you're all for

4640.909 --> 4648.08
talking me when I'm explaining well then

4644.81 --> 4651.35
go ahead tell me how I just brought

4648.08 --> 4656.33
today what exactly do they get wrong the

4651.35 --> 4658.6990000000005
method they get the method wrong how by

4656.33 --> 4661.34
not using it and using something else

4658.699 --> 4664.849999999999
saying is you don't know you don't I

4661.34 --> 4668.119000000001
just told you you stupid [ __ ] you don't

4664.85 --> 4670.46
I just told you you I just don't told

4668.119 --> 4672.889
you oh you said they get it wrong

4670.46 --> 4674.9890000000005
because they get it wrong use something

4672.889 --> 4678.679
else and then say it's alright and it's

4674.989 --> 4679.339999999999
not just you just you don't know you

4678.679 --> 4681.32
don't even know

4679.34 --> 4683.4800000000005
the scientific method is and you don't

4681.32 --> 4688.969
know how they get it wrong solve it you

4683.48 --> 4689.9
stupid [ __ ] how do scientists get it

4688.969 --> 4692.9
wrong today

4689.9 --> 4695.33
Arwen they don't use it anymore they use

4692.9 --> 4698.0199999999995
something else and say it's alright

4695.33 --> 4702.53
just like I were telling you twice now

4698.02 --> 4706.969
what specifically do they get wrong the

4702.53 --> 4711.8
system of it the formula which part at

4706.969 --> 4714.11
what huh whatever acid they get it yes

4711.8 --> 4716.360000000001
yes you said that you for what do they

4714.11 --> 4718.28
get wrong Arwa every time you explain it

4716.36 --> 4720.889
you get it wrong you don't use it

4718.28 --> 4724.88
anymore you just use a piece of

4720.889 --> 4727.159000000001
deductive reasoning okay so I said what

4724.88 --> 4728.03
what part of this that let me repeat to

4727.159 --> 4730.969
you what I said

4728.03 --> 4733.4
what part and tell me when I'm done what

4730.969 --> 4736.28
I'm getting wrong the scientific method

4733.4 --> 4739.549999999999
you make observations you formulate a

4736.28 --> 4743.719
hypothesis you test the predictions of

4739.55 --> 4746.51
the hypothesis you you gather data you

4743.719 --> 4749.4800000000005
find you refine alter expand or reject

4746.51 --> 4751.849
your hypothesis and keep repeating until

4749.48 --> 4754.94
you can develop general theories and

4751.849 --> 4756.77
then you repeat the entire process all

4754.94 --> 4759.678999999999
over again what part of that am i

4756.77 --> 4763.46
getting wrong and what does that

4759.679 --> 4766.01
hypothesis contain Oh Brenda because

4763.46 --> 4767.929
that's actually what we were that's what

4766.01 --> 4769.6990000000005
I was referencing that they don't get

4767.929 --> 4775.84
the method right so what does a

4769.699 --> 4779.75
hypothesis contain Brenda it contains a

4775.84 --> 4783.110000000001
hypothesis about what it is that you're

4779.75 --> 4786.349
observing what hypothesis contains a

4783.11 --> 4789.0199999999995
hypothesis no no it is the hypothesis

4786.349 --> 4792.71
what does a hypothesis contain what are

4789.02 --> 4796.429
the elements of hypothesis please it

4792.71 --> 4798.7390000000005
tries to understand no I'm not the

4796.429 --> 4803.2390000000005
father of the best content not the

4798.739 --> 4806.409
function the content you make an

4803.239 --> 4809.388999999999
observation do you formulate a

4806.409 --> 4813.3099999999995
hypothesis surrounding it the content of

4809.389 --> 4813.31
the hypothesis Brenda

4814.209 --> 4819.559
I'm not sure I know what your what your

4816.769 --> 4823.610000000001
even a hypothesis the hypothesis what

4819.559 --> 4825.789
does it contain not everything

4823.61 --> 4828.92
surrounding it not its function the

4825.789 --> 4831.55
content of the hypothesis what is in a

4828.92 --> 4834.86
hypothesis

4831.55 --> 4838.820000000001
I'm still not sure it's it's a it's an

4834.86 --> 4841.808999999999
explanation it are you literally

4838.82 --> 4845.739
demented we've been telling you this

4841.809 --> 4848.269
hundreds of times in the last half year

4845.739 --> 4854.558999999999
hundreds of times are you demented

4848.269 --> 4857.9890000000005
Brenda a hypothesis contains a proposed

4854.559 --> 4861.650000000001
explanation of your observations no it

4857.989 --> 4865.4
does not you can stop sharing and what

4861.65 --> 4876.348999999999
does it contain that Arwen then what is

4865.4 --> 4878.089999999999
it supposed to be sure I really wouldn't

4876.349 --> 4884.179
like to fill Brenda in thank you very

4878.09 --> 4887.900000000001
much is based on observations and it

4884.179 --> 4891.829
would be your proposed explanation or

4887.9 --> 4894.558999999999
cause of the phenomena you are observing

4891.829 --> 4897.978999999999
oh god where is Nathan when you need him

4894.559 --> 4901.34
Oh what's wrong with that

4897.979 --> 4904.249000000001
Arwen it's wrong that's what's wrong oh

4901.34 --> 4906.38
it's wrong what Webb said I guess is not

4904.249 --> 4909.019
part of a freaking hypothesis

4906.38 --> 4913.1900000000005
well then exploit then explain it to me

4909.019 --> 4916.159000000001
what did I get wrong the system it's a

4913.19 --> 4918.86
system it's a formula and a system you

4916.159 --> 4921.978999999999
have the independent variables which is

4918.86 --> 4925.039
the cause of the effect within the

4921.979 --> 4927.229
observed phenomena but I just ended

4925.039 --> 4930.65
variable and you have controlled

4927.229 --> 4933.26
variables and that is our policies

4930.65 --> 4936.259999999999
Brenda that is the scientific method

4933.26 --> 4940.55
that is the core of the scientific

4936.26 --> 4944.749
method My Goddess hypothesis is a

4940.55 --> 4946.88
explanation for the phenomenon we are

4944.749 --> 4950.679
observed goodbye bro

4946.88 --> 4950.679
and you stupid [ __ ]

4960.199 --> 4967.219
yeah and enough of that enough of that

4968.6 --> 4975.570000000001
Brenda knows she just messing with you

4972.65 --> 4977.489
Jesus our orders freaking contours hair

4975.57 --> 4978.65
was she the worst then she doesn't even

4977.489 --> 4983.04
have a [ __ ]

4978.65 --> 4986.28
alright she's won anyway I can't believe

4983.04 --> 4989.4
you asked me to Hillary I just needed

4986.28 --> 4992.73
something I guess even the tag partner

4989.4 --> 4995.28
and Nathan wasn't there I just calmly

4992.73 --> 4998.48
tell her saying I was gonna say it but I

4995.28 --> 5007.58
didn't know if you wanted me to tell her

4998.48 --> 5019.759999999999
because I was yeah I think you should be

5007.58 --> 5023.2699999999995
the one to fill her in yeah well it was

5019.76 --> 5027.29
it did go exactly how expected she did

5023.27 --> 5029.81
very persistently red-herring me it's

5027.29 --> 5032.199
very systematically every single step of

5029.81 --> 5035.2390000000005
the way wherever she could find a spot

5032.199 --> 5037.179999999999
with without any nervousness in your

5035.239 --> 5042.5
voice so she's a very systematic

5037.18 --> 5046.43
slippery red herring Welsh fish slapping

5042.5 --> 5049.64
champion Brendan is a Welsh fish

5046.43 --> 5058.46
slapping red herring champion I thought

5049.64 --> 5061.910000000001
she will be argument really I don't

5058.46 --> 5063.62
think so it's quite funny how she kept

5061.91 --> 5069.59
her cool the entire way it you were

5063.62 --> 5071.26
literally turning into a wreck no I was

5069.59 --> 5075.37
just getting really freaking pissed off

5071.26 --> 5075.37
that's how I get pissed off

5075.93 --> 5083.42
I just I really don't get why bringing

5080.01 --> 5087.75
up this radio image of the black hole

5083.42 --> 5090.81
shows anything what what's the point of

5087.75 --> 5094.89
that it's something that nobody will be

5090.81 --> 5097.17
ever able to validate ever ever nobody

5094.89 --> 5099.150000000001
will be able to validate filming or

5097.17 --> 5104.97
capturing an image of something that's a

5099.15 --> 5106.98
freaking black hole alright so they

5104.97 --> 5109.650000000001
could show us anything if the shoulders

5106.98 --> 5113.299999999999
are unique or because I said this is

5109.65 --> 5113.299999999999
what's at the center of the black hole

5115.07 --> 5125.46
you know you could take an ax radio

5122.19 --> 5127.98
image of something that is billions

5125.46 --> 5131.25
times bigger than our Sun but we can't

5127.98 --> 5136.7699999999995
get one real photo of there I mean come

5131.25 --> 5139.91
on that makes no sense nothing about it

5136.77 --> 5143.67
makes any damn sense it's a delusional

5139.91 --> 5148.8
mesmerize religion and it's gonna turn

5143.67 --> 5152.7
everyone into gibbering insane and

5148.8 --> 5154.860000000001
people spouting nonsense all day long

5152.7 --> 5158.929999999999
it's gonna be like tartarean all over

5154.86 --> 5162.929999999999
again I was I was thinking about the

5158.93 --> 5166.2300000000005
little moon thing that Israel tried to

5162.93 --> 5168.33
attempt to send and I really think that

5166.23 --> 5173.19
that was kind of how it was planned out

5168.33 --> 5175.08
to crash-land and when when people hear

5173.19 --> 5177.8099999999995
that that it crashed landed on the moon

5175.08 --> 5181.26
it reinforced his people that the moon

5177.81 --> 5184.38
is physical and I think that's all they

5181.26 --> 5186.150000000001
wanted to do was to to make reinforce

5184.38 --> 5188.97
that the moon is something physical

5186.15 --> 5190.349999999999
because I don't think it is but I think

5188.97 --> 5193.08
that was the whole point of is really

5190.35 --> 5198.42
doing that besides stealing all that

5193.08 --> 5202.53
money people may not agree with that but

5198.42 --> 5205.47
that's kind of how I saw it because once

5202.53 --> 5207.57
it once it crashed they all had their

5205.47 --> 5209.43
speeches ready and so that tells me that

5207.57 --> 5212.16
it was planned

5209.43 --> 5213.450000000001
of course like of course it's black how

5212.16 --> 5216.42
did all these guys have all these

5213.45 --> 5219.0
speeches and they were speeches about

5216.42 --> 5221.37
you know next time we'll do this and

5219.0 --> 5224.07
it's like okay that was pre-planned

5221.37 --> 5234.99
somebody wrote that they knew that it

5224.07 --> 5237.509999999999
was gonna do that they didn't even have

5234.99 --> 5243.03
any cameras okay was all just a bunch of

5237.51 --> 5246.81
CGI models ridiculous information it was

5243.03 --> 5250.889999999999
literally a moon landing emulation like

5246.81 --> 5253.910000000001
you know hosts they train officers in

5250.89 --> 5256.17
Star Trek in the holodeck an emulation

5253.91 --> 5259.86
this is literally what they were doing

5256.17 --> 5263.7
with primitive for 21st century 3d

5259.86 --> 5267.15
models it's an emulation it's ridiculous

5263.7 --> 5269.91
so Tony Tony if I give up the previous

5267.15 --> 5273.259999999999
with with Brenda before you filled the

5269.91 --> 5276.66
ridden before can you tell us why you

5273.26 --> 5280.68
never filled in Brenda let's change the

5276.66 --> 5287.87
terminology though the wide-angle did

5280.68 --> 5290.04
you attack Brenda what's what subjects

5287.87 --> 5292.65
you know when you were filling her in

5290.04 --> 5296.25
you know we were just talking about the

5292.65 --> 5301.0199999999995
scientific method and she just couldn't

5296.25 --> 5302.4
do it oh right I've never spoke to her

5301.02 --> 5305.64
about scientific method she's never been

5302.4 --> 5308.7
that far with me to be honest she

5305.64 --> 5310.860000000001
ascribes to a concept where the

5308.7 --> 5313.08
scientific method is basically ignored

5310.86 --> 5315.45
and reinterpreted in a much broader

5313.08 --> 5317.4
fashion so you can basically do whatever

5315.45 --> 5320.13
with it whatever you want and you don't

5317.4 --> 5323.219999999999
actually have to physically confirm

5320.13 --> 5325.9800000000005
anything because as she claims without

5323.22 --> 5329.88
any actual backup just conjecture about

5325.98 --> 5333.0
it theorizing science doesn't prove

5329.88 --> 5335.16
anything so in that she foundationally

5333.0 --> 5337.77
disagrees with the scientific method

5335.16 --> 5340.17
which requires an independent variable

5337.77 --> 5342.870000000001
to vary in order to prove the cause of

5340.17 --> 5346.63
the effect within the observation

5342.87 --> 5348.01
so yeah just ridiculous ballers don't

5346.63 --> 5349.6
like the cause-and-effect relationship

5348.01 --> 5353.29
because it shits all over their ability

5349.6 --> 5359.29
to claim explain sunsets bye see you

5353.29 --> 5366.04
later for that that claim so you wanted

5359.29 --> 5368.71
to link Tony no I was just going I'll

5366.04 --> 5369.97
just catch him back up from what and cuz

5368.71 --> 5372.85
he was still live so I thought I'll just

5369.97 --> 5377.7
go in for a Chuck right now I can keep

5372.85 --> 5377.700000000001
on going you know doing a show today so

5378.12 --> 5387.69
easy clover yeah romscout look great it

5384.91 --> 5390.79
was alright let's get out the gutter

5387.69 --> 5394.299999999999
yeah yeah we can get out the gutter now

5390.79 --> 5397.5
can't we yes that's okay then Nathan

5394.3 --> 5402.7
Nathan zing Louis he's got a little girl

5397.5 --> 5404.47
mm-hmm so when right so where were we we

5402.7 --> 5407.98
were talking about how the rumpus was

5404.47 --> 5413.08
not I said been a your points that you

5407.98 --> 5415.66
were validly making right that was

5413.08 --> 5418.2699999999995
before yeah actually that sounds I just

5415.66 --> 5419.5
need to retract that it sound wrong now

5418.27 --> 5422.05
that you've actually pointed it out that

5419.5 --> 5423.54
way I didn't mean it that way he's in

5422.05 --> 5431.2
clear

5423.54 --> 5433.75
oh shut up don't even yeah we do ignore

5431.2 --> 5436.179999999999
it so if you don't if he says there's

5433.75 --> 5437.89
something improper and you don't see it

5436.18 --> 5440.320000000001
it's better just not to think about it

5437.89 --> 5446.110000000001
yeah I didn't notice it until Rainey's

5440.32 --> 5449.099999999999
Brent he said that was why I changed the

5446.11 --> 5449.099999999999
topic yeah

5449.22 --> 5453.18
Bronte you do sound a little bit echo

5454.89 --> 5460.09
it's the place to actually have my

5458.11 --> 5462.4
office I could do it in the bigger room

5460.09 --> 5463.900000000001
that's next door I would go with the

5462.4 --> 5464.92
bigger room because when you if you go

5463.9 --> 5467.049999999999
in the small room which is what

5464.92 --> 5468.16
everybody seems to do you always end up

5467.05 --> 5470.35
thinking I should have gone for the

5468.16 --> 5472.92
bigger room go for the bigger room right

5470.35 --> 5472.92
yeah

5473.899 --> 5480.169000000001
scrolling that yeah means I have to

5477.229 --> 5485.479
dismantle this massive massive computer

5480.169 --> 5486.05
desk oh oh but at least you have fun

5485.479 --> 5495.26
doing it

5486.05 --> 5498.860000000001
it's all part of memories yes sorry

5495.26 --> 5503.09
how's your back doing my ribs oh yeah

5498.86 --> 5504.919
yeah rips back yeah yeah well yeah it's

5503.09 --> 5511.579
still very painful but they give me

5504.919 --> 5513.439
these four muscle relaxants also I've

5511.579 --> 5517.579
got some coca-cola moulds max strength

5513.439 --> 5519.26
and ibuprofen so as a combination the

5517.579 --> 5523.459
working pretty good to the pain relief

5519.26 --> 5526.820000000001
so okay be careful though that you don't

5523.459 --> 5529.809
take too many chemicals that your

5526.82 --> 5531.289
regeneration metabolism is gonna be

5529.809 --> 5535.999
disrupted by it

5531.289 --> 5537.379
you still need to heal yeah I need to

5535.999 --> 5538.01
get back to work so I'll be back to work

5537.379 --> 5540.199
tomorrow

5538.01 --> 5544.729

5556.399 --> 5566.320000000001
if you're not careful with that [ __ ]

5557.829 --> 5570.159
true Oh on a more positive note

5566.32 --> 5572.509999999999
Liverpool play Chelsea in the next hour

5570.159 --> 5577.789
City a brain palace at the minute it's

5572.51 --> 5580.6990000000005
one no lifetime to city boo sleep on the

5577.789 --> 5584.509999999999
broken say Steve is just full sleep on

5580.699 --> 5586.308999999999
the broken side really why would you

5584.51 --> 5591.05
want to sleep on your broken side screw

5586.309 --> 5599.899
that build the shed like that we got a

5591.05 --> 5604.070000000001
shed runty that was like him like a

5599.899 --> 5605.3
polka ruther me Mme so we'll a little

5604.07 --> 5608.429999999999
bar in there and

5605.3 --> 5610.2
you know is it to singles is it to

5608.43 --> 5612.96
singles or is it one big garage with

5610.2 --> 5614.88
like single good Thor yes only courage

5612.96 --> 5616.11
although the best time you can put your

5614.88 --> 5625.26
car in and get out your car in the

5616.11 --> 5632.04
garage that face room for me and the

5625.26 --> 5633.66
mates to anger him so you did get your

5632.04 --> 5639.78
car back right

5633.66 --> 5644.55
but yesterday well I think these fellas

5639.78 --> 5646.65
over because he said the the the oil

5644.55 --> 5648.72
pump that they were going to exchange

5646.65 --> 5651.0599999999995
they said that when they called the new

5648.72 --> 5652.47
oil pump in they realized that there was

5651.06 --> 5654.570000000001
a problem with it and it didn't actually

5652.47 --> 5656.58
connect properly so the ended up put in

5654.57 --> 5659.969999999999
the original one back in and familiar

5656.58 --> 5662.58
with enough now that works however the

5659.97 --> 5666.6
engine management light is still coming

5662.58 --> 5669.72
on the red wire that was for the the oil

5666.6 --> 5671.490000000001
isn't coming on however I think they've

5669.72 --> 5673.530000000001
just disconnected that because the

5671.49 --> 5675.24
windows don't work properly anymore so

5673.53 --> 5677.13
you know any trying to when you can just

5675.24 --> 5679.349999999999
click the windows and they just stop or

5677.13 --> 5680.91
properly to the top doesn't work anymore

5679.35 --> 5682.26
you have to keep your finger on them so

5680.91 --> 5684.0
I think they've done is I think they've

5682.26 --> 5686.6900000000005
messed around with the electrics somehow

5684.0 --> 5690.54
and this this you know sort of like

5686.69 --> 5692.25
disconnected some of the leads that

5690.54 --> 5693.66
would tell you things I think there's

5692.25 --> 5695.82
probably still a problem with the oil

5693.66 --> 5698.94
pump but they've disconnected this of

5695.82 --> 5700.62
the red light doesn't show renting you

5698.94 --> 5707.07
had a really bad experience with that

5700.62 --> 5709.41
route yeah sorry the shop that he fix

5707.07 --> 5711.509999999999
his car they kept giving him they kept

5709.41 --> 5714.42
getting the runaround right yeah all

5711.51 --> 5717.21
right yeah so the wind is it like I said

5714.42 --> 5719.43
the windows aren't working now you can

5717.21 --> 5720.9
still do them but you can't just touch

5719.43 --> 5722.31
them and then they just go it's awfully

5720.9 --> 5724.53
kind just to touch them they go down to

5722.31 --> 5726.120000000001
the bottom you have to manually hold

5724.53 --> 5728.219999999999
them so they definitely screwed battle

5726.12 --> 5730.05
which makes me think that they messed

5728.22 --> 5731.58
around with the electrics completely and

5730.05 --> 5734.37
I reckon that probably is still a

5731.58 --> 5738.21
problem with the oil con but because

5734.37 --> 5738.96
they've disconnected the electrics you

5738.21 --> 5740.88
know it's not

5738.96 --> 5743.43
showing off so I'm gonna take it to

5740.88 --> 5749.58
another garage tomorrow and ask them to

5743.43 --> 5752.820000000001
do a check on it right yeah fine look

5749.58 --> 5756.719
good Garrett it can be difficult just go

5752.82 --> 5758.489
Stan cost me absolutely 40 what you

5756.719 --> 5762.44
really want what I've personally always

5758.489 --> 5765.66
found the most reliable or like the real

5762.44 --> 5768.2699999999995
individual wrench monkeys like that are

5765.66 --> 5770.79
covered in oil and everything in dirty

5768.27 --> 5773.450000000001
shops they that are like a one-man shop

5770.79 --> 5775.7699999999995
or maybe they have like an apprentice or

5773.45 --> 5778.7699999999995
someone one person that works for those

5775.77 --> 5781.4400000000005
are usually the best but it's the the

5778.77 --> 5785.01
the more cooperative corporate

5781.44 --> 5788.099999999999
corporation driven garages with a lot of

5785.01 --> 5790.4400000000005
people I don't know those can be good or

5788.1 --> 5794.01
they can be terrible all depending on

5790.44 --> 5796.41
your relations with them and it was

5794.01 --> 5799.02
quite funny the missus she got into the

5796.41 --> 5801.9
phone within this week I think it was

5799.02 --> 5804.06
about probably Tuesday or Wednesday and

5801.9 --> 5806.969
she was giving him what for on the phone

5804.06 --> 5808.77
and then he's like ah he says well me

5806.969 --> 5810.93
and my missus have fallen out and I've

5808.77 --> 5813.18
turned to drink now and I'm drinking

5810.93 --> 5814.92
blah blah blah blah and now I'm leaving

5813.18 --> 5816.51
it to the guys and the guy who I'm not

5814.92 --> 5818.25
always there so I can't always say

5816.51 --> 5820.38
exactly what's going on but I will

5818.25 --> 5822.63
travel if it out for ya blah blah blah

5820.38 --> 5823.9800000000005
so she could meet you told bill that

5822.63 --> 5825.3
says Hank wait wait a minute

5823.98 --> 5827.82
so the guy that wrote the guy that owns

5825.3 --> 5829.4400000000005
is an alcoholic and he's now blaming it

5827.82 --> 5835.71
on these honey's word colleagues or his

5829.44 --> 5840.23
employees and whatever they call it that

5835.71 --> 5840.2300000000005
bag that they were dragged into Alcala

5840.53 --> 5846.8099999999995
that's uh that's really unprofessional

5843.11 --> 5850.23
yeah I just yeah I think we need to

5846.81 --> 5852.330000000001
basically just get a new car you know

5850.23 --> 5854.759999999999
just try and get older than you uh-huh

5852.33 --> 5861.0
oh just get out on a fixed and then sell

5854.76 --> 5863.6900000000005
it yeah it was as long as he's not

5861.0 --> 5866.16
running hard you'd be able to sell it

5863.69 --> 5867.54
yeah I mean it seems to dry it seems to

5866.16 --> 5870.51
drive over I mean I Drive

5867.54 --> 5873.18
drove me around yesterday seems to be

5870.51 --> 5875.360000000001
really okay or you know you doesn't know

5873.18 --> 5877.860000000001
if the oil is not proper in its the oil

5875.36 --> 5880.0199999999995
you know if the the oil pump isn't

5877.86 --> 5881.339999999999
working properly if you know it's going

5880.02 --> 5883.43
to take a bit of time for that to take

5881.34 --> 5886.650000000001
effect isn't it

5883.43 --> 5889.320000000001
for it to destroy the engine book well

5886.65 --> 5892.65
the way they really test the oil system

5889.32 --> 5895.5599999999995
quality is to just step on it for like

5892.65 --> 5898.08
an hour or something drive really fast

5895.56 --> 5899.88
for a prolonged period then you'll

5898.08 --> 5906.8099999999995
figure out if the oil is done right or

5899.88 --> 5908.49
not they don't he paid them to do the

5906.81 --> 5912.06
job and it's not right keep taking it

5908.49 --> 5914.94
back until it is right but he may not

5912.06 --> 5918.21
want them working on his car anymore no

5914.94 --> 5921.2699999999995
I would look for some other another

5918.21 --> 5923.13
garish now cuz the not want to touch

5921.27 --> 5924.4800000000005
some another previous mechanics work you

5923.13 --> 5925.53
need to keep going back to the company

5924.48 --> 5928.32
that's not doing it right in the first

5925.53 --> 5929.88
place well yeah that's the point brother

5928.32 --> 5932.639999999999
go around in the morning and just say

5929.88 --> 5935.31
look the windows aren't even closing

5932.64 --> 5937.740000000001
properly now on their own you know so

5935.31 --> 5940.38
obviously there's something happened

5937.74 --> 5942.0599999999995
between what what work you've done and

5940.38 --> 5944.88
the fact that now the windows don't

5942.06 --> 5946.35
close so that's an issue on your part

5944.88 --> 5949.08
because they were closing when I gave

5946.35 --> 5952.17
you the car right right okay yeah yeah

5949.08 --> 5956.55
yeah try to get those things right at

5952.17 --> 5958.11
least on a more important note run see

5956.55 --> 5959.52
when are you were gonna paint your wall

5958.11 --> 5963.66
green for your green screen

5959.52 --> 5966.570000000001
well no changing rooms I'll be able to

5963.66 --> 5969.9
do it because this desk that we got

5966.57 --> 5971.58
ahold of we slowly advertised and talked

5969.9 --> 5974.46
to two trips to actually get it all that

5971.58 --> 5976.62
comes in three pieces its massive no the

5974.46 --> 5979.92
why hundred quid for it so we offered

5976.62 --> 5981.63
them fifty and the accepted so I put it

5979.92 --> 5983.34
all together yesterday talk to me about

5981.63 --> 5986.34
probably a couple of hours to actually

5983.34 --> 5988.08
put it all together really good but it

5986.34 --> 5991.2300000000005
takes up three-quarters of the room in

5988.08 --> 5993.72
this small room so I had to face it next

5991.23 --> 5995.07
to the to the door so I would have had

5993.72 --> 5996.72
the door behind me so I wouldn't have

5995.07 --> 5999.4
able to do the green screen but if I'm

5996.72 --> 6000.33
changing rooms now then

5999.4 --> 6004.049999999999
you know I'll be able to say all

6000.33 --> 6006.239
properly in the other room so yeah man

6004.05 --> 6010.02
you know but by next weekend it'll be a

6006.239 --> 6020.009999999999
little ready to go cool

6010.02 --> 6023.070000000001
oh yeah garage time it's not very

6020.01 --> 6027.409000000001
flattering no I don't know I talk about

6023.07 --> 6030.179
my daily life things as well not that I

6027.409 --> 6036.389999999999
really have car problems or anything

6030.179 --> 6039.75
what yeah some might shout out to eat in

6036.39 --> 6042.96
Chapter all right it's so you know you

6039.75 --> 6046.199
live in a place where it's like six

6042.96 --> 6050.94
people live in the house is it me no

6046.199 --> 6055.53
yeah that's it four five four occupants

6050.94 --> 6058.71
but yeah the the bigger room yeah they

6055.53 --> 6060.96
usually have are with two of them it's

6058.71 --> 6065.28
big I haven't had trouble with it and

6060.96 --> 6066.6
said they have parties irregularly hey

6065.28 --> 6068.699
Ron see ya

6066.6 --> 6070.26
I'm are you thinking every replacing

6068.699 --> 6072.299999999999
your boiler is your boiler quite older

6070.26 --> 6074.55
now so you thinking upon a new one in no

6072.3 --> 6077.34
oh we do need to get one with your own

6074.55 --> 6078.900000000001
to fix the pressure on it because you

6077.34 --> 6080.9400000000005
know even though you squished it off so

6078.9 --> 6083.67
it's actually completely off the intake

6080.94 --> 6087.928999999999
valve and the outtake so you know the

6083.67 --> 6090.0
the bend the wire that connects the two

6087.929 --> 6092.55
so they're really switched off they are

6090.0 --> 6094.62
actually on the off position but there

6092.55 --> 6097.56
is some sneaky water getting into the

6094.62 --> 6099.8099999999995
pressure so every seven or eight hours

6097.56 --> 6102.330000000001
I'm having to you know go to one of the

6099.81 --> 6104.79
raid years and bleed it to release the

6102.33 --> 6106.409
pressure see that sounds like it see

6104.79 --> 6107.85
that was the problem I had with mind I'm

6106.409 --> 6111.69
let me tell you a story right it's quit

6107.85 --> 6116.31
while I was losing pressure and I do

6111.69 --> 6118.919999999999
what you just said put pressure on oh

6116.31 --> 6120.4800000000005
man was losing it so basically I got my

6118.92 --> 6121.65
plumber guy out and I said what's wrong

6120.48 --> 6122.909
with this I said I don't know where it's

6121.65 --> 6124.469
leaking they said it's losing pressure

6122.909 --> 6126.179
but I don't I'm not seeing any evidence

6124.469 --> 6127.469
that it's leaking in the houses it's

6126.179 --> 6130.08
obviously leaking somewhere else but I

6127.469 --> 6132.21
don't know where anyway he said he

6130.08 --> 6132.53
worked out what was wrong with losing

6132.21 --> 6136.37
pressure

6132.53 --> 6138.32
usually just air slipping in well stuck

6136.37 --> 6140.57
and then loses pressure I've had that

6138.32 --> 6142.7
problem many times it was it was going

6140.57 --> 6145.549999999999
out the in my case it was going up the

6142.7 --> 6148.4
emergency relief valve because there was

6145.55 --> 6150.53
an issue with the the heat exchanger was

6148.4 --> 6152.0599999999995
leak was leaking and it was exhausting

6150.53 --> 6153.53
itself out of the into the gutter

6152.06 --> 6155.570000000001
because that's where it exhausted itself

6153.53 --> 6157.61
so I wasn't even noticing it going wrong

6155.57 --> 6159.29
and but I could tell that the fresh you

6157.61 --> 6161.15
were dropping anyway he said it's a heat

6159.29 --> 6162.95
exchanger he said that that's like you

6161.15 --> 6164.15
might as well buy a new boiler he said

6162.95 --> 6166.4
these things are like really expensive

6164.15 --> 6168.11
so I went online to see how much they

6166.4 --> 6170.089999999999
were the well it's six hundred and sixty

6168.11 --> 6174.679999999999
quid plus fat for a new heat exchanger

6170.09 --> 6177.38
anyway six hundred and sixty plus fat it

6174.68 --> 6178.610000000001
was and I'm he said monitoring was off

6177.38 --> 6179.900000000001
he said just check what they eagerly

6178.61 --> 6181.91
fitted he said because they're under

6179.9 --> 6184.16
warranty for like ten years this part I

6181.91 --> 6185.66
said I've not had it in ten years I said

6184.16 --> 6187.28
well as long as you're a plumber when he

6185.66 --> 6189.139999999999
fitted it as long as he registered it

6187.28 --> 6189.98
when he fitted it properly then it'll be

6189.14 --> 6192.14
covered under warranty

6189.98 --> 6193.459999999999
anyway I rang got worcester literally I

6192.14 --> 6195.56
rang them on the Friday at like

6193.46 --> 6197.36
dinnertime and I had a new [ __ ] heat

6195.56 --> 6199.22
exchanger part don't meet on me drive

6197.36 --> 6201.41
the guide like the Saturday morning

6199.22 --> 6203.42
delivered it on me drive and it was six

6201.41 --> 6204.95
hundred and sixty plus fat for a new

6203.42 --> 6207.68
heat exchanger and it was completely

6204.95 --> 6208.94
free so while my point was if you are

6207.68 --> 6210.17
thinking of changing the boiler get a

6208.94 --> 6211.639999999999
Worcester boiler because they have a ten

6210.17 --> 6215.21
year warranty on the heat exchanger and

6211.64 --> 6219.2300000000005
it's well worth having it to be

6215.21 --> 6221.45
understanding so a new boiler can wait

6219.23 --> 6225.62
till the end of the year so to go back

6221.45 --> 6230.389999999999
to where tomorrow a couple of weeks off

6225.62 --> 6233.8099999999995
well sorta so just take it easy don't

6230.39 --> 6236.990000000001
push yourself and you know it's

6233.81 --> 6240.77
expensive moving into anywhere no it is

6236.99 --> 6244.55
don't do it don't do it well not until I

6240.77 --> 6249.4400000000005
have like a pile of money to to use for

6244.55 --> 6252.49
that because I know I have I last 10

6249.44 --> 6252.49
years I've moved

6254.44 --> 6264.95
three four times terrible it always cost

6260.96 --> 6266.54
money I was there I was at a loose end

6264.95 --> 6268.429999999999
last night so I decided to look into

6266.54 --> 6271.82
that discord chat to see you know on the

6268.43 --> 6273.92
defier 24/7 thing that I'm Karen B gets

6271.82 --> 6275.24
involved with I've know I've been in

6273.92 --> 6276.53
there once or twice before but I've

6275.24 --> 6278.33
never spent any time in there I've never

6276.53 --> 6279.5599999999995
got involved in any conversations and

6278.33 --> 6281.8099999999995
never had any back and forth just

6279.56 --> 6283.580000000001
because it's all drongos anyway some

6281.81 --> 6285.110000000001
[ __ ] little kid it was about fifteen

6283.58 --> 6287.3
or sixteen was telling everybody in

6285.11 --> 6289.94
there about gravity and now it's a force

6287.3 --> 6291.71
and all this and I went in there to try

6289.94 --> 6293.629999999999
and speak to him but I I was because

6291.71 --> 6295.58
I've never spoken there before I was

6293.63 --> 6297.86
muted something one of the mods ought to

6295.58 --> 6299.9
all meet me and I gets moved into this

6297.86 --> 6301.73
other room on this mod says to me says

6299.9 --> 6303.62
in what side of the fence he on huh

6301.73 --> 6305.36
sighs I'm on the flat earth side he said

6303.62 --> 6307.61
are you a fighter and I said yeah well I

6305.36 --> 6309.32
don't claim it's flat bottom I realized

6307.61 --> 6311.66
that we're not on a sphere I said so

6309.32 --> 6312.74
yeah I'm a kind of a flat earther and he

6311.66 --> 6314.12
said then we'll just be aware that

6312.74 --> 6315.469999999999
they'll challenge you unlike you what

6314.12 --> 6316.91
your views are when you go in there he

6315.47 --> 6318.110000000001
says so just be prepared to have a bit

6316.91 --> 6320.12
of a back-and-forth I said yeah that's

6318.11 --> 6322.099999999999
fine anyway they have this thing where

6320.12 --> 6323.78
they have like a gold you get given a

6322.1 --> 6325.85
state a role and then like if you got

6323.78 --> 6329.03
and the legit and genuine you get given

6325.85 --> 6330.47
like this gold stays and it's reserved

6329.03 --> 6332.719999999999
for like you know people that are

6330.47 --> 6334.76
credible and then I went in there and

6332.72 --> 6336.08
within 25 minutes I'd them all short

6334.76 --> 6336.9800000000005
enough about being living on a ball

6336.08 --> 6338.63
because it was like where's your

6336.98 --> 6340.73
evidence for gravity where's the axial

6338.63 --> 6343.04
rotation evidence blah blah blah I'm

6340.73 --> 6345.2
waiting 25 minutes I had this gold thing

6343.04 --> 6348.92
and I was like alright thanks for me my

6345.2 --> 6351.11
medal I don't know what it was and I got

6348.92 --> 6359.72
it in like half an hour like so it was a

6351.11 --> 6362.78
good Damien don't tell him about tell

6359.72 --> 6364.58
them about what peanuts cure inspire he

6362.78 --> 6368.45
was sending you messages after he talked

6364.58 --> 6371.09
to this kid I was talking to call Ciaran

6368.45 --> 6372.349999999999
he was doing the usual I'm 15 am rock

6371.09 --> 6374.96
hard cuz I'm in school and I know

6372.35 --> 6376.31
everything thing and I said okay so we

6374.96 --> 6378.68
started talking about gravity and all

6376.31 --> 6380.150000000001
this and when he left he didn't say that

6378.68 --> 6382.280000000001
he was leaving he just like disappeared

6380.15 --> 6383.9
so like I didn't notice him leave but

6382.28 --> 6385.79
after after he'd left he sent me a

6383.9 --> 6386.75
message Eunice's thanks for opening my

6385.79 --> 6388.61
eyes to the [ __ ]

6386.75 --> 6390.44
the earth might not be spherical so I

6388.61 --> 6392.0
just give him a big smile and he said

6390.44 --> 6392.389999999999
although I don't know where I go from

6392.0 --> 6393.74
here

6392.39 --> 6396.38
because I don't think I can prove that

6393.74 --> 6397.5199999999995
the earth is flat or if it is not and I

6396.38 --> 6397.9400000000005
said you don't have to prove that it's

6397.52 --> 6399.71
flat

6397.94 --> 6401.54
you just don't we don't have any tools

6399.71 --> 6403.76
to do it we have no money we've got a

6401.54 --> 6405.71
p900 and a compass just show that it's

6403.76 --> 6407.27
not a ball that's all I can do lots of

6405.71 --> 6408.77
evidence to show that it's not a ball

6407.27 --> 6410.870000000001
and then he said what was that video

6408.77 --> 6413.150000000001
that he said about 100 proofs of the S

6410.87 --> 6414.65
not a ball so I posted a new Bayes 200

6413.15 --> 6416.599999999999
proofs that the Earth nos but involved

6414.65 --> 6418.129999999999
and he'd you said Thanks I'm listening I

6416.6 --> 6420.08
just can't speak I'm in the call I am

6418.13 --> 6421.9400000000005
still in the call and smile that was it

6420.08 --> 6424.25
oh yeah Kieran was in there being a

6421.94 --> 6427.099999999999
little ball at the troll and I don't

6424.25 --> 6429.83
know Lisa and I'm at the point now where

6427.1 --> 6432.38
anybody that sat that cites Newton as a

6429.83 --> 6433.79
force or gravity as a force I've just

6432.38 --> 6435.86
gotta laugh at you didn't say no since

6433.79 --> 6438.2
1920 it wasn't it's never been a force

6435.86 --> 6439.61
since 1920 and Einstein's theory of

6438.2 --> 6441.05
relativity it's always been a

6439.61 --> 6443.54
mathematical construct called

6441.05 --> 6445.55
the curvature of space-time stop saying

6443.54 --> 6447.62
gravities of force it's not having not

6445.55 --> 6449.0
my current science anyway technically

6447.62 --> 6453.73
that's not even correct

6449.0 --> 6457.37
it's the Einsteinian concept is the

6453.73 --> 6462.679999999999
support theory to reason out because of

6457.37 --> 6465.14
gravity it doesn't even well Einstein

6462.68 --> 6466.280000000001
Ingram's it doesn't have any application

6465.14 --> 6469.09
in experiment because it's a

6466.28 --> 6469.09
mathematical construct

6470.08 --> 6476.75
no but it's it's trying to tell the

6474.2 --> 6479.51
cause of suppose it matter a mass being

6476.75 --> 6482.39
attracted by mass and displacing it

6479.51 --> 6484.7
outside a mass so it's just completely

6482.39 --> 6490.22
mysterious it just happens to be a

6484.7 --> 6492.62
gravity because what its tration that

6490.22 --> 6494.72
will cause this momentum of everything

6492.62 --> 6497.15
being pulled towards there but it's just

6494.72 --> 6501.2300000000005
the suppose that science fiction cos is

6497.15 --> 6505.73
delivered the actual effect is yeah it

6501.23 --> 6508.91
doesn't even really address the the the

6505.73 --> 6511.969999999999
mechanics of physics it's it's a

6508.91 --> 6514.5199999999995
backdrop reasoning as to what causes it

6511.97 --> 6517.22
it's really great it's completely

6514.52 --> 6520.55
outside of the field of actual Natural

6517.22 --> 6522.650000000001
Sciences completely yeah so major dump

6520.55 --> 6524.54
in chances I will see it's been proven

6522.65 --> 6525.86
not to be a sphere there's loads of ways

6524.54 --> 6527.33
it's been proven not to be a sphere

6525.86 --> 6528.74
there's a lack of curvature for stars

6527.33 --> 6531.44
you've gotten off curve but you're on a

6528.74 --> 6533.03
ball and if we're supposed to be turning

6531.44 --> 6534.86
that supposed to be the cause of sunrise

6533.03 --> 6536.24
and sunset yet all the science shows

6534.86 --> 6538.25
that it's not all that's turning it's

6536.24 --> 6541.969999999999
the sky so we've got my cousin Gail

6538.25 --> 6544.46
Michelson Morley Lorentz and riess

6541.97 --> 6546.17
fairly sagnik all those experiments

6544.46 --> 6550.34
observations or tests have all shown

6546.17 --> 6551.99
that the sky that's turning knows about

6550.34 --> 6553.64
there's no evidence to support gravity

6551.99 --> 6555.65
but you absolutely need gravity on a

6553.64 --> 6556.97
ball in the middle of vacuum of space if

6555.65 --> 6558.589999999999
you're gonna claim that the reason why

6556.97 --> 6560.87
the atmosphere sticks to it is because

6558.59 --> 6563.150000000001
of gravity you need that gravity on our

6560.87 --> 6564.74
side yeah maybe there may not be there

6563.15 --> 6566.179999999999
but we definitely don't need it because

6564.74 --> 6567.86
we're contained but you guys definitely

6566.18 --> 6569.780000000001
need it because otherwise the atmosphere

6567.86 --> 6571.91
is gonna burst into space because we are

6569.78 --> 6573.469999999999
in pressure and there is no membrane

6571.91 --> 6576.0199999999995
that alder in apparently according to

6573.47 --> 6577.64
you morons but that that one thing in

6576.02 --> 6579.17
itself proves that we can't be on a ball

6577.64 --> 6580.87
that's in the existing in the middle of

6579.17 --> 6584.51
a vacuum because it's complete nonsense

6580.87 --> 6586.97
to be fair though just try to look into

6584.51 --> 6590.21
the historical records of what has been

6586.97 --> 6593.27
talked about and I don't think that

6590.21 --> 6597.35
Einstein or Newton even addressed the

6593.27 --> 6600.01
issue of this address the issue of gas

6597.35 --> 6601.79
pressure requiring a container and

6600.01 --> 6603.92
involving the earth date

6601.79 --> 6605.57
they didn't make up this concept that

6603.92 --> 6607.43
gravity is supposed to be pushing the

6605.57 --> 6610.13
atmosphere on the earth they never even

6607.43 --> 6613.400000000001
really addressed it yeah Newton himself

6610.13 --> 6615.59
said that I say no hypothesis for

6613.4 --> 6617.2699999999995
gravitation and it was only after his

6615.59 --> 6619.49
death did he become famous for his

6617.27 --> 6624.14
theories on a cat and the mechanics of

6619.49 --> 6628.099999999999
movement right well sort of the rest of

6624.14 --> 6629.92
it the the the ball issues were taken

6628.1 --> 6632.42
literal even though they were purely

6629.92 --> 6636.46
conjecture spent theoretical conjecture

6632.42 --> 6639.2300000000005
to him himself probably like a hobby but

6636.46 --> 6642.65
they never addressed the gas pressure

6639.23 --> 6644.8099999999995
issue both of them don't just correct

6642.65 --> 6647.11
try to find me any kind of quotation

6644.81 --> 6649.97
that addresses the gas pressure issue

6647.11 --> 6652.259999999999
involving gravity and outer space none

6649.97 --> 6655.8
of them address it

6652.26 --> 6659.1900000000005
they didn't barking there's no record of

6655.8 --> 6662.909000000001
it being addressed and that is the huge

6659.19 --> 6666.03
problem for the entire system because

6662.909 --> 6668.46
even if you presuppose all of their

6666.03 --> 6671.268999999999
things all of their concepts it still

6668.46 --> 6675.57
doesn't work and they don't know how to

6671.269 --> 6677.67
counteract this just yet I've theorized

6675.57 --> 6681.719
a couple of ways they could do it but

6677.67 --> 6684.929
it's very science fictiony and they

6681.719 --> 6686.67
haven't done it so Jiwon Karloff says

6684.929 --> 6689.159
remember to point out the system's

6686.67 --> 6691.1990000000005
definition of vacuum void of matter

6689.159 --> 6693.268999999999
let's hear them talk the way of that old

6691.199 --> 6695.369
chestnut I don't see why that's an issue

6693.269 --> 6696.809
if you got if you devoid of matter and

6695.369 --> 6698.46
you have a disequilibrium with the

6696.809 --> 6700.889
pressure that doesn't result as a result

6698.46 --> 6703.26
of it the vacuum of no pressure 10 to

6700.889 --> 6706.349
the minus 17 tor apparently then if you

6703.26 --> 6709.289000000001
have seven 14.7 PSI at sea level on

6706.349 --> 6710.969
earth existed next to that without some

6709.289 --> 6713.07
kind of barrier we have a contradiction

6710.969 --> 6715.019
in science because you can't have one

6713.07 --> 6716.13
without some kind of membrane you can

6715.019 --> 6717.869000000001
have gas pressure with our membrane

6716.13 --> 6719.309
whether it's a vacuum or not you just

6717.869 --> 6720.989
need a disequilibrium which is what

6719.309 --> 6723.3
we're supposed to have can't have it

6720.989 --> 6725.19
without a membrane so it's like let's

6723.3 --> 6727.559
address why we've got how we have gas

6725.19 --> 6729.869
pressure without a membrane first they

6727.559 --> 6733.9490000000005
just won't do it can you can you address

6729.869 --> 6736.348999999999
the difference between a pool and a suck

6733.949 --> 6740.969
right because I still hear a lot of fun

6736.349 --> 6742.1990000000005
editors claiming vacuum right and it's

6740.969 --> 6744.719
near suck right

6742.199 --> 6746.669999999999
can you explain oh right it's a moot

6744.719 --> 6749.789
point it doesn't change the difference

6746.67 --> 6752.61
we all understand that technically it's

6749.789 --> 6754.5
not a suck it's a push now what that

6752.61 --> 6757.65
actually means is that the pressure of

6754.5 --> 6759.239
Earth is like an exploding bullet coming

6757.65 --> 6761.369
out of a gun in that there's an

6759.239 --> 6764.039
explosion right but we're caught mid

6761.369 --> 6766.589999999999
explosion and the explosion wants to

6764.039 --> 6768.539
burst off into space like a bomb but

6766.59 --> 6770.55
where the gravity's holding the bomb

6768.539 --> 6772.619
explosion to earth that's really what's

6770.55 --> 6773.909000000001
happening but if nobody really

6772.619 --> 6775.71
understands it when you put it that way

6773.909 --> 6778.379999999999
because it sounds ridiculous but that is

6775.71 --> 6780.389
the position and when we describe it as

6778.38 --> 6781.17
a sock and the atmosphere gets sucked

6780.389 --> 6783.3
off into space

6781.17 --> 6785.309
technically it's wrong but everybody

6783.3 --> 6785.820000000001
understands what the point is that we're

6785.309 --> 6787.29
making

6785.82 --> 6789.179999999999
so I don't think it matters that

6787.29 --> 6790.83
technically it's wrong what matters is

6789.18 --> 6792.990000000001
there is that this equilibrium between

6790.83 --> 6794.82
the two points so whether it's a sock or

6792.99 --> 6796.71
a blow doesn't matter what matters is

6794.82 --> 6799.0199999999995
you've got you've got entropy applying

6796.71 --> 6801.72
at all times so that pressure is

6799.02 --> 6804.030000000001
bursting to get into space but the claim

6801.72 --> 6805.8
is that gravity's holding it back you

6804.03 --> 6808.41
know that minuscule force that was

6805.8 --> 6810.42
quantified by Cavendish to be 1 in 50

6808.41 --> 6812.49
millionth of the object's weight well

6810.42 --> 6814.4400000000005
the power of gravity that's supposed to

6812.49 --> 6815.91
be Newtonian right is supposed to be a

6814.44 --> 6817.95
50 millionth of the way of the

6815.91 --> 6820.71
atmosphere so however heavy the weight

6817.95 --> 6822.8099999999995
of the atmosphere is the only one fifty

6820.71 --> 6824.67
millionth of its weight is the force of

6822.81 --> 6826.620000000001
gravity and that's the attractive force

6824.67 --> 6828.56
between masses and that's supposed to

6826.62 --> 6831.42
hold it on the earth on the earth

6828.56 --> 6833.910000000001
against the the the 10 to the minus 17

6831.42 --> 6836.49
Torr about the vacuum of space it's like

6833.91 --> 6839.61
it's like a camel trying to pull of a

6836.49 --> 6842.099999999999
jumbo 747 down the runway the camel

6839.61 --> 6844.799999999999
being gravity and the jumbo 747 be in

6842.1 --> 6847.110000000001
there the the the explosive effect of

6844.8 --> 6849.75
the 10 to the minus 17 differential it's

6847.11 --> 6852.12
ridiculous but that it's a moot point

6849.75 --> 6852.93
it's technically wrong to describe it as

6852.12 --> 6855.18
a suck

6852.93 --> 6857.58
sorry it's technically wrong to describe

6855.18 --> 6858.93
it as vacuum sucking and but we all

6857.58 --> 6861.6
understand the point that's being made

6858.93 --> 6863.01
so basically yeah give it them just say

6861.6 --> 6864.150000000001
yeah you're right but it doesn't change

6863.01 --> 6868.08
the fact that there's a disequilibrium

6864.15 --> 6868.83
of 14.7 PSI I compared to 10 to the

6868.08 --> 6870.39
minus 17

6868.83 --> 6872.49
Torr and there's not a there's not a

6870.39 --> 6873.96
membrane of some kind between the two to

6872.49 --> 6876.03
give us the gas pressure in the first

6873.96 --> 6877.44
place but never don't let them talk

6876.03 --> 6879.179999999999
about the gradient until the address

6877.44 --> 6881.04
where it comes from and it always comes

6879.18 --> 6883.92
back to Newtonian principles for gravity

6881.04 --> 6885.6
and by 1920 that was antiquated science

6883.92 --> 6887.4
and it's now Einstein Ian's curvature of

6885.6 --> 6889.08
space-time and how the hell are you

6887.4 --> 6890.879999999999
going to explain gravity in that context

6889.08 --> 6894.66
of the atmosphere of the earth when it's

6890.88 --> 6896.7300000000005
curves nonsense I just I just really

6894.66 --> 6899.61
really think that words have meaning and

6896.73 --> 6902.429999999999
I think that words words should be used

6899.61 --> 6904.259999999999
correctly and that's all I wanted to

6902.43 --> 6908.52
address that for a moment look the

6904.26 --> 6911.070000000001
shocking part is a mechanical colloquial

6908.52 --> 6913.2300000000005
approach it's a practical approach to

6911.07 --> 6916.469999999999
differentiate between blowing and

6913.23 --> 6917.459999999999
sucking as a mechanical process like a

6916.47 --> 6919.29
vacuum cleaner

6917.46 --> 6921.96
what yeah

6919.29 --> 6924.99
physically there is no sucking there is

6921.96 --> 6926.54
only gas pressure push we correct for

6924.99 --> 6929.37
this equilibrium that's it

6926.54 --> 6930.96
yeah but I think although you're right

6929.37 --> 6933.2699999999995
words do have meaning and I completely

6930.96 --> 6935.28
agree and and completely concede the

6933.27 --> 6936.84
point that it's not technically the

6935.28 --> 6939.8099999999995
atmosphere being sucked off into space

6936.84 --> 6941.55
on this it doesn't really matter because

6939.81 --> 6942.75
whether it's suck or a blow it doesn't

6941.55 --> 6945.33
really matter because I'm in this

6942.75 --> 6947.7
context there's the movement of entropy

6945.33 --> 6949.23
entropy is pulling the pressure into the

6947.7 --> 6951.84
app well it's not it's been pushed into

6949.23 --> 6953.759999999999
space there is another point is that

6951.84 --> 6955.29
there is pressure and there is entropy

6953.76 --> 6957.66
and there's no barrier between the two

6955.29 --> 6959.46
so the pressure is gonna burst into the

6957.66 --> 6960.84
entropy and fill the available volume

6959.46 --> 6963.18
that's what it says and that's what we

6960.84 --> 6964.32
all know it does so and it doesn't

6963.18 --> 6965.7300000000005
really matter it's a moot point

6964.32 --> 6967.469999999999
technically the Wrights but let's not

6965.73 --> 6969.45
dwell on it because the bigger picture

6967.47 --> 6972.21
is well what stops from bursting into

6969.45 --> 6974.04
space oh it's gravity okay what gravity

6972.21 --> 6977.37
is that then is it Newtonian gone by

6974.04 --> 6980.13
1920 or is it an Estonian mathematical

6977.37 --> 6982.32
only no application in real world you

6980.13 --> 6985.5
matter you just have to lay out these

6982.32 --> 6987.66
suppose it's strength of gravity and how

6985.5 --> 6989.61
it how it is supposed to work

6987.66 --> 6991.92
according to their theories from all the

6989.61 --> 6994.889999999999
angles and you figure out it's just a

6991.92 --> 6997.56
slight push it's just a slight push a

6994.89 --> 6999.780000000001
constant force this equilibrium that's

6997.56 --> 7001.79
what it should technically be if you

6999.78 --> 7004.3099999999995
would assume that it is a force it would

7001.79 --> 7007.67
be a force manifestation as a force this

7004.31 --> 7009.77
equilibrium downwards at a constant rate

7007.67 --> 7012.9800000000005
and that's just a slight constant push

7009.77 --> 7016.490000000001
technically so that's not enough to

7012.98 --> 7019.129999999999
counteract yeah the entropy force of gas

7016.49 --> 7023.599999999999
pressure wanting to expand within the

7019.13 --> 7025.76
container yeah just can't can but what I

7023.6 --> 7026.75
would say is just immediately concede it

7025.76 --> 7028.37
if they have a challenge you want

7026.75 --> 7030.59
sucking the atmosphere off into space

7028.37 --> 7032.2699999999995
just immediately concede it because they

7030.59 --> 7034.13
use that art that point there to

7032.27 --> 7035.6
obfuscate the bigger point so if they

7034.13 --> 7038.75
can get you arguing over whether it's a

7035.6 --> 7040.700000000001
soccer a push and then they win thereby

7038.75 --> 7042.53
making it all for skated just say yeah

7040.7 --> 7045.679999999999
okay I'll give you the list blow who

7042.53 --> 7048.71
cares and I explained are you happy I

7045.68 --> 7051.08
will be saying that it is push look they

7048.71 --> 7052.67
will get technical on me so I have to be

7051.08 --> 7055.67
technical about it and

7052.67 --> 7057.86
as physic physics oriented correct as

7055.67 --> 7059.9
possible when I explained it to Butler

7057.86 --> 7062.389999999999
so I don't say it's gonna be sucked off

7059.9 --> 7064.4
into space I tell that to people that

7062.39 --> 7066.410000000001
are just fresh to the subject and I

7064.4 --> 7068.48
still use a lot of colloquial words to

7066.41 --> 7070.34
make it more understandable to them but

7068.48 --> 7071.9
when I get technical with ballers yeah

7070.34 --> 7075.2300000000005
you oh yeah

7071.9 --> 7080.92
I will definitely avoid the concept of

7075.23 --> 7080.919999999999
suck and just say gas pressure expansion

7081.07 --> 7085.67
my point was if a vacuum is void of

7083.9 --> 7087.5
matter how can there be planets etc

7085.67 --> 7089.81
which are supposed to be made of matter

7087.5 --> 7091.969
void of matter that's not our problem

7089.81 --> 7093.860000000001
isn't that your claim your claim is that

7091.969 --> 7095.84
we live in a vacuum of space or a very

7093.86 --> 7097.4
near vacuum I don't know what they are

7095.84 --> 7098.42
other than likes I don't really care

7097.4 --> 7100.07
what they are but what they're

7098.42 --> 7104.06
definitely not is things that you can

7100.07 --> 7105.349999999999
learn Rockets on because there's no

7104.06 --> 7106.88
evidence to prove that we can we can't

7105.35 --> 7108.89
prove that the reason physical like

7106.88 --> 7110.2390000000005
tangible objects they just believe that

7108.89 --> 7117.62
they are because they do kind of look

7110.239 --> 7119.87
tangible right yeah just real quickly

7117.62 --> 7123.5599999999995
back to that question that you you read

7119.87 --> 7125.57
earlier sleeping warrior you stated what

7123.56 --> 7127.9400000000005
are you or reading someone's comin you

7125.57 --> 7131.66
stated what proofs are there that the

7127.94 --> 7135.259999999999
earth is not a globe right and it's not

7131.66 --> 7137.84
a flat earthers choice to try to prove a

7135.26 --> 7142.070000000001
negative and so the burden of proof is

7137.84 --> 7143.4800000000005
is not on a flat earther we don't have

7142.07 --> 7146.12
to prove gas pressure without a

7143.48 --> 7149.209999999999
container we're just basically stating

7146.12 --> 7151.28
that it cannot happen correct and so so

7149.21 --> 7154.16
when when someone says what are your

7151.28 --> 7155.2699999999995
proofs the earth is not a ball and you

7154.16 --> 7157.46
don't have to answer that

7155.27 --> 7161.679
I mean why that's just a dumb way to put

7157.46 --> 7161.679
a question I think yeah I agree

7166.719 --> 7177.57
I just it's strange how we can see it

7173.469 --> 7182.32
but others can't I don't I don't get it

7177.57 --> 7183.75
well I think that's the man I think I

7182.32 --> 7186.429999999999
honestly think that after these balls

7183.75 --> 7187.9
will really reject everything that's put

7186.43 --> 7190.030000000001
their way no matter what it is the other

7187.9 --> 7191.349999999999
half no rumpus absolutely knows that

7190.03 --> 7193.78
we're not living on a ball but he pushes

7191.35 --> 7196.39
that we are he knows we're not he knows

7193.78 --> 7200.41
when to obfuscate points I remind myself

7196.39 --> 7201.52
of Brandon toy he was a mystery burr and

7200.41 --> 7203.92
they were chatting about the etwas

7201.52 --> 7206.080000000001
affect the claim that is dependent on

7203.92 --> 7207.4
your latitude and the rotation of the

7206.08 --> 7209.32
earth will make objects lighter or

7207.4 --> 7211.78
heavier now obviously it's ridiculous

7209.32 --> 7213.099999999999
because if it was you could buy gold and

7211.78 --> 7214.69
the North Pole and sell it at the

7213.1 --> 7216.67
equator and because of the centrifugal

7214.69 --> 7218.739
force it'd be worth much less than when

7216.67 --> 7220.81
it was at the the the North Pole so

7218.739 --> 7222.099999999999
you'd have to mattli the way by it on

7220.81 --> 7223.660000000001
the equator then sell it at the North

7222.1 --> 7224.89
Pole and it'd be worth a lot more at the

7223.66 --> 7225.969
North Pole because it's significantly

7224.89 --> 7228.46
heavier because of the centrifugal force

7225.969 --> 7230.32
it's not working against it and then

7228.46 --> 7231.969
when Brandon was talking to geo Street

7230.32 --> 7233.469
but Brandon realized that it was purely

7231.969 --> 7235.21
mathematical it wasn't based on any

7233.469 --> 7237.04
empirical evidence and they got the the

7235.21 --> 7239.29
equation or the graph that they were

7237.04 --> 7241.03
relying on in the Hangout they got it

7239.29 --> 7242.92
based on a computer representation of

7241.03 --> 7244.989
the model wasn't based on real-world

7242.92 --> 7246.13
empirical data it was based on what it

7244.989 --> 7248.799999999999
should look like if the earth was a

7246.13 --> 7250.21
sphere with the the change I'm Brandon

7248.8 --> 7250.719
had spotted it and he was homing in on

7250.21 --> 7252.699
that point

7250.719 --> 7254.35
rompers had realized completely that

7252.699 --> 7256.0599999999995
that's what he was doing and rompers

7254.35 --> 7257.530000000001
took a tactical foul where he actually

7256.06 --> 7259.0
got kicked out the Hangout so that the

7257.53 --> 7260.469
point was obfuscated and that's what

7259.0 --> 7262.06
happened the point got obfuscated and

7260.469 --> 7264.46
brandon didn't realize that he just

7262.06 --> 7266.59
although we'd won his point the point

7264.46 --> 7268.81
had then been lost because rompers took

7266.59 --> 7270.91
a tactical foul and got taken out by

7268.81 --> 7272.92
geogebra as host because rompers

7270.91 --> 7274.3
basically obfuscated he interrupted and

7272.92 --> 7276.67
started calling him a [ __ ] and stuff

7274.3 --> 7278.8
like that and so got kicked out but then

7276.67 --> 7280.81
the point then died and brandon was left

7278.8 --> 7282.31
wondering oh well at least geo street

7280.81 --> 7284.080000000001
was kicked this [ __ ] out but

7282.31 --> 7286.120000000001
ultimately his point that he was just

7284.08 --> 7289.33
about to win on then got forgotten about

7286.12 --> 7291.5199999999995
and that told me that bumpers absolutely

7289.33 --> 7293.469
knows which points to obfuscate and

7291.52 --> 7295.2390000000005
argue rumpa stnos that were not living

7293.469 --> 7297.04
in a ball but he tells everybody that we

7295.239 --> 7299.08
are and I can understand out how he

7297.04 --> 7300.07
could eat how could you do that so it's

7299.08 --> 7302.8
a it's a

7300.07 --> 7304.179
your fellow humans you know that we're

7302.8 --> 7313.929
not living on a bowl but you argue that

7304.179 --> 7315.909
we are that green man when didn't embalm

7313.929 --> 7319.179
he's got a man gotta take it to the

7315.909 --> 7322.2699999999995
grave yeah go ahead go ahead Harvard no

7319.179 --> 7332.13
I just said ranty left I just notice

7322.27 --> 7334.27
yourself like a few minutes ago so hey

7332.13 --> 7340.599
what have you been up to

7334.27 --> 7342.46
Riley just doing some work on some

7340.599 --> 7346.63
properties and stuff just living life

7342.46 --> 7348.639
and just wondering why why is five more

7346.63 --> 7349.869
toxic than what it should be just losing

7348.639 --> 7351.76
interest with people that I thought were

7349.869 --> 7356.92
cool that I realize they're not actually

7351.76 --> 7359.71
cool at all what do you mean I just

7356.92 --> 7361.329
think that we should be able to

7359.71 --> 7363.13
respectfully disagree with each other

7361.329 --> 7365.5599999999995
without it being massive brick walls

7363.13 --> 7366.639
between each other and hatred and not

7365.56 --> 7369.7300000000005
speaking to each other and all this

7366.639 --> 7371.619
nonsense well I don't know you gotta

7369.73 --> 7373.419999999999
realize that to a lot of people

7371.619 --> 7374.848999999999
flatterers even though they might

7373.42 --> 7377.8
embrace it

7374.849 --> 7379.869000000001
it can still be very stressful because

7377.8 --> 7384.159000000001
they're very entangled with people that

7379.869 --> 7386.98
are not so they might just take any kind

7384.159 --> 7390.009999999999
of friction as a opportunity to

7386.98 --> 7391.54
basically push all their flatter fest

7390.01 --> 7394.360000000001
away so they can have their peace and

7391.54 --> 7395.92
quiet and not get bothered so much by

7394.36 --> 7398.38
the confronted the inevitable

7395.92 --> 7400.27
confrontations they would have with the

7398.38 --> 7404.53
rest of of their colleagues and their

7400.27 --> 7407.889
friends and family see so thank you it's

7404.53 --> 7410.17
very every person that deals with Flat

7407.889 --> 7413.29
Earth and thinks about it a lot will

7410.17 --> 7415.9890000000005
have problems with the people that they

7413.29 --> 7420.13
deal with that don't know anything about

7415.989 --> 7422.348999999999
it and don't want to so I think youths

7420.13 --> 7425.53
use comment there in chat is absolutely

7422.349 --> 7428.17
on the on the money is comment is rumpus

7425.53 --> 7428.469
being an Intel operative explains it for

7428.17 --> 7430.4800000000005
me

7428.469 --> 7432.099
I completely agree you have to have a

7430.48 --> 7433.8099999999995
certain amount of intelligence to be

7432.099 --> 7435.46
able to argue that it's a ball

7433.81 --> 7437.320000000001
well rumpus does go beyond that basic

7435.46 --> 7438.91
level of intelligence to argue it's a

7437.32 --> 7440.679999999999
ball I'm gonna see him deliberately

7438.91 --> 7442.78
obfuscating points that he knows he's

7440.68 --> 7445.54
gonna he has to obfuscate because alou

7442.78 --> 7447.16
he will lose that's when he continuously

7445.54 --> 7448.6
speaks over people in Nathan's the more

7447.16 --> 7449.83
he talks the more he talks and more he

7448.6 --> 7452.08
talks that's the point getting

7449.83 --> 7453.28
obfuscated he's doing that intention

7452.08 --> 7455.0199999999995
he's not doing that because he's an

7453.28 --> 7456.28
[ __ ] he is an [ __ ] but that's not

7455.02 --> 7457.6
the reason he's doing it he's doing it

7456.28 --> 7460.0
because he knows that if he doesn't do

7457.6 --> 7461.8
it he's gonna lose that point and he

7460.0 --> 7464.23
can't have that he needs to reassert his

7461.8 --> 7466.570000000001
religion at all costs over and over and

7464.23 --> 7468.04
over again I agree with rumpus is an

7466.57 --> 7470.53
Intel operative he has to be because

7468.04 --> 7473.05
he's he's too intelligent not to realize

7470.53 --> 7475.87
that were genuinely not on a ball he

7473.05 --> 7480.55
realizes he knows could it could it be

7475.87 --> 7483.91
possible all of that was around could it

7480.55 --> 7486.49
be possible with their go ahead I was

7483.91 --> 7489.91
just saying hello to matrix and and his

7486.49 --> 7496.96
mic is a little muffled can you speak up

7489.91 --> 7498.3099999999995
again matrix great hello guys hi yeah of

7496.96 --> 7503.8
the mic how's the microphone

7498.31 --> 7506.7300000000005
good good right so peanuts you were

7503.8 --> 7509.62
making a point could it be possible that

7506.73 --> 7512.889999999999
Anthony used the word toxic but in

7509.62 --> 7515.92
fighting or whatever you have so many

7512.89 --> 7519.25
different levels of thinking on one

7515.92 --> 7521.41
topic right I know you two guys you're

7519.25 --> 7523.48
willing to stay I don't know what the

7521.41 --> 7526.0599999999995
Sun is and then we have some people

7523.48 --> 7529.599999999999
saying oh the Sun is you how shy I think

7526.06 --> 7532.240000000001
the Sun is this you know when we first

7529.6 --> 7534.9400000000005
come to this topic and the first time

7532.24 --> 7537.3099999999995
you try to explain it to somebody it's

7534.94 --> 7539.759999999999
gonna be very lousy it's not gonna be a

7537.31 --> 7542.4400000000005
you're not gonna prepare a good argument

7539.76 --> 7545.74
yeah once you've had experience you know

7542.44 --> 7548.349999999999
how to approach somebody could that be

7545.74 --> 7549.34
all that it is it's just no notice at

7548.35 --> 7551.47
different levels

7549.34 --> 7553.66
no know what what it is for me the

7551.47 --> 7555.91
people that I used to look up to will

7553.66 --> 7557.92
not accept that there is the genuine

7555.91 --> 7560.17
discourse against the position that they

7557.92 --> 7563.14
hold and because there is genuine

7560.17 --> 7565.57
discourse discord against it it means

7563.14 --> 7567.400000000001
that they can't accept it it's not that

7565.57 --> 7568.99
they're arguing that they're right or

7567.4 --> 7570.759999999999
it's more that they refused to accept

7568.99 --> 7573.46
that the views of other people are

7570.76 --> 7576.150000000001
equally as dogmatism is equally as valid

7573.46 --> 7578.05
and potentially correct as their own and

7576.15 --> 7579.58
at the end of the day if you're gonna

7578.05 --> 7581.49
take a philosophical approach to

7579.58 --> 7583.54
something that is empirical then

7581.49 --> 7585.49
philosophically speaking that's not a

7583.54 --> 7587.56
strong position to take but if you're

7585.49 --> 7588.19
arguing philosophically I'm gonna say

7587.56 --> 7591.04
mm-hmm

7588.19 --> 7592.24
okay I accept your position but doesn't

7591.04 --> 7594.13
make it true just because you believe

7592.24 --> 7596.7699999999995
that it is true I want to see the proof

7594.13 --> 7598.51
that it is true for example you can't

7596.77 --> 7600.22
argue that there is a general up and

7598.51 --> 7602.110000000001
down unless you can prove that there is

7600.22 --> 7604.54
actually a genuine general up and down

7602.11 --> 7606.009999999999
yeah you can percieve spit ball I might

7604.54 --> 7607.99
pass ideas around that it could be a

7606.01 --> 7609.64
general up and down or a universal up

7607.99 --> 7612.3099999999995
and down but unless you've got evidence

7609.64 --> 7615.64
that helps at least supports that and in

7612.31 --> 7617.160000000001
the absence of an credible alternative

7615.64 --> 7619.72
explanation that doesn't require a

7617.16 --> 7621.3099999999995
universal up-and-down then you have this

7619.72 --> 7623.5
perception where you've just come across

7621.31 --> 7626.200000000001
like a bigot and that that's one of the

7623.5 --> 7628.21
things that I find like obtuse you can't

7626.2 --> 7629.74
be bigoted you've got to accept that all

7628.21 --> 7631.4800000000005
the people like me and our window always

7629.74 --> 7633.07
agree on stuff I remember the first time

7631.48 --> 7635.32
I heard are when talking about perhaps

7633.07 --> 7636.969999999999
the Sun is a holographic projection and

7635.32 --> 7639.16
my initial reaction the first time I may

7636.97 --> 7641.41
have heard him say it was what an idiot

7639.16 --> 7642.849999999999
that makes no sense but actually I agree

7641.41 --> 7645.43
with him now have thought about it more

7642.85 --> 7646.4800000000005
because whatever the Sun is it does

7645.43 --> 7649.150000000001
appear that we all get our own

7646.48 --> 7650.86
individual Sun and it does appear that

7649.15 --> 7652.8099999999995
whatever the Sun is it's it's not

7650.86 --> 7654.58
capable of triangulation it doesn't

7652.81 --> 7656.650000000001
triangulate they all claim it does when

7654.58 --> 7658.54
you get three points but it doesn't it's

7656.65 --> 7660.429999999999
been tested we can test it ourselves

7658.54 --> 7661.9
it does not triangulate the way that

7660.43 --> 7664.780000000001
we're told it does I'm slice back

7661.9 --> 7666.5199999999995
improved it it doesn't triangulate and

7664.78 --> 7668.65
he claimed it did he never showed where

7666.52 --> 7670.51
all the other eyes went and but the

7668.65 --> 7672.49
point is that whatever the Sun may or

7670.51 --> 7675.43
may not be it's definitely not this

7672.49 --> 7677.29
fusion hydrogen ball that's likes it's a

7675.43 --> 7679.39
fusion reaction of this that and the

7677.29 --> 7682.3
other it appears to be the light that's

7679.39 --> 7684.700000000001
a focal point of light source coming

7682.3 --> 7686.47
from somewhere else may not be light but

7684.7 --> 7688.5
it's not a tangible object as far as I

7686.47 --> 7691.09
can see it seems to be a non tangible

7688.5 --> 7693.01
manifestation of some kind and the best

7691.09 --> 7695.29
way I can describe the Sun is creation

7693.01 --> 7698.2
it's proof of creation in my eyes it's

7695.29 --> 7700.28
not necessarily scientific and yet

7698.2 --> 7701.96
philosophical perhaps but

7700.28 --> 7704.09
you can argue what the soul nazar is not

7701.96 --> 7705.5
because none of us really know but there

7704.09 --> 7707.75
are some people that are really bigoted

7705.5 --> 7709.94
on certain points and refused to accept

7707.75 --> 7711.289
that all the people may not genuinely

7709.94 --> 7713.629999999999
disagree with them without being

7711.289 --> 7719.03
vitriolic against that their view it's

7713.63 --> 7727.909000000001
just not necessarily true that's just

7719.03 --> 7729.59
called being a grown-up ideas to see

7727.909 --> 7733.219
what lands because that's how you get

7729.59 --> 7735.8
the truth don't don't you wouldn't you

7733.219 --> 7739.25
want someone challenging on your side

7735.8 --> 7741.289
absolutely that's why that's what

7739.25 --> 7743.84
creates good ideas you don't check to

7741.289 --> 7745.969
challenging each other it means the idea

7743.84 --> 7746.96
either it makes it home succeed or it

7745.969 --> 7749.42
makes it fail

7746.96 --> 7750.8
I think our wins the first one to admit

7749.42 --> 7753.2300000000005
that we didn't initially get on

7750.8 --> 7755.150000000001
initially because it felt personal with

7753.23 --> 7756.919999999999
if I disagreed with him on some but I

7755.15 --> 7758.15
think he's realized in time that I'm not

7756.92 --> 7760.849
necessarily disagreeing with him

7758.15 --> 7763.19
personally there was a lot of ego in the

7760.849 --> 7765.02
beginning there was a lot of egos post

7763.19 --> 7766.839999999999
because it was very new to us it was

7765.02 --> 7771.26
that it was it was a reality like a

7766.84 --> 7773.42
shift change so we had problems

7771.26 --> 7775.400000000001
adjusting you know what I'm saying so

7773.42 --> 7778.099
everybody had their own egos they had to

7775.4 --> 7780.23
deal with for now sorry I I remember

7778.099 --> 7782.96
watching you guys order all the time I

7780.23 --> 7786.169999999999
was there from day one and trust issues

7782.96 --> 7788.0
in general because everyone backstabbing

7786.17 --> 7791.51
was going on from all sides people

7788.0 --> 7793.429
pretending to be on your side and [ __ ]

7791.51 --> 7795.619000000001
doing things behind your back remember

7793.429 --> 7798.679
like three years ago when the infighting

7795.619 --> 7801.348999999999
was the worst now it's pretty much all

7798.679 --> 7805.01
settled everything everybody kind of

7801.349 --> 7807.1990000000005
knows everyone understands that the dome

7805.01 --> 7809.75
and these things that we kind of prove

7807.199 --> 7811.848999999999
it we just we wanted to believe this so

7809.75 --> 7815.09
bad cuz it makes it makes so much sense

7811.849 --> 7817.610000000001
but we know that week we us right here

7815.09 --> 7819.17
we can't prove the dome you know what

7817.61 --> 7821.42
I'm saying most of the people that have

7819.17 --> 7823.25
here online all day every day don't have

7821.42 --> 7826.28
the money to be able to afford these

7823.25 --> 7828.8
things typically have to be belief I

7826.28 --> 7829.34
might be accepting that the dome is the

7828.8 --> 7830.900000000001
Stars

7829.34 --> 7832.55
unless anyone can prove that it's not

7830.9 --> 7833.53
the Stars I think that the dome actually

7832.55 --> 7835.03
is the Stars we

7833.53 --> 7836.289
every single night and don't realize

7835.03 --> 7837.759999999999
we're looking at the dole because how

7836.289 --> 7841.289
else could you have fixed stars in the

7837.76 --> 7841.289000000001
night sky you've got all the structures

7850.949 --> 7859.15
forgive me all right what I'm trying to

7855.909 --> 7861.579
say is that not just the Sun disc is at

7859.15 --> 7864.579
an apparent distance as a hologram

7861.579 --> 7867.429
it's the stars as well and they always

7864.579 --> 7869.11
appear to be at the same distance you

7867.429 --> 7871.9490000000005
never get the impressions like oh wow

7869.11 --> 7875.53
the stars look really close today or oh

7871.949 --> 7878.049999999999
it's like a clock either what's wrong or

7875.53 --> 7880.599
they're not strong but they always look

7878.05 --> 7884.02
at the same distance the apparent

7880.599 --> 7885.67
distance as a demo globe I for me

7884.02 --> 7887.77
personally when I look at the Stars

7885.67 --> 7890.11
I'm happy to accept that the stars are

7887.77 --> 7892.75
probably the construct like whatever it

7890.11 --> 7894.5199999999995
is dome or otherwise because I realize

7892.75 --> 7896.02
that whatever the stars are that they're

7894.52 --> 7897.369000000001
every night they're in the same position

7896.02 --> 7899.530000000001
every night and they're all rotating

7897.369 --> 7901.089999999999
like with each other now all right yeah

7899.53 --> 7903.28
you can interpret that Earth earth

7901.09 --> 7905.619000000001
rotation but I also realize that there

7903.28 --> 7907.03
has to be some kind of construct for the

7905.619 --> 7909.07
Stars to exist in it can't be

7907.03 --> 7913.9
metaphysical when they're all moving in

7909.07 --> 7917.53
unison I mean I think the guy why

7913.9 --> 7920.46
wouldn't it be in a universal way that's

7917.53 --> 7923.7699999999995
like a fractal well it would have to

7920.46 --> 7926.349
prove everybody oh well even with

7923.77 --> 7929.38
fractal logics if you throw in the same

7926.349 --> 7933.01
formula every time the patterns gonna be

7929.38 --> 7936.400000000001
the same every time so if this light is

7933.01 --> 7938.1900000000005
frakked aligned somehow in nature and

7936.4 --> 7941.65
yeah I presume it's gonna be

7938.19 --> 7944.5
electromagnetically cost somehow then

7941.65 --> 7946.78
why wouldn't it manifest exactly like

7944.5 --> 7951.659
this just like the moon always has this

7946.78 --> 7956.05
exact same fractal pattern always

7951.659 --> 7959.138999999999
because consideration of the curvature

7956.05 --> 7961.4490000000005
of our own eyes now at a certain

7959.139 --> 7964.03
distance it also distorts it just like

7961.449 --> 7965.469
caramels just like telescopes so we

7964.03 --> 7966.61
don't really you know we don't really

7965.469 --> 7970.81
have a grass or

7966.61 --> 7972.88
or how all all of it works so maybe this

7970.81 --> 7974.9800000000005
is why they haven't so much difficulty

7972.88 --> 7976.51
understanding where they see in the

7974.98 --> 7979.0
curvature maybe they don't understand

7976.51 --> 7981.219
that different factors our eyes the

7979.0 --> 7982.9
camera lens you know what I'm saying it

7981.219 --> 7984.01
distorts everything maybe that's they

7982.9 --> 7985.629999999999
really believe that that's what

7984.01 --> 7989.9490000000005
curvature is they're not understanding

7985.63 --> 7993.01
how our vision works right why it is

7989.949 --> 7995.138999999999
very complex how it works yeah so

7993.01 --> 7997.659000000001
Anthony back to what you say I have

7995.139 --> 8002.07
trouble keeping an oversight in other

7997.659 --> 8004.71
words so so Anthony what about what we

8002.07 --> 8008.849999999999
call wandering stars right that's not

8004.71 --> 8011.46
fixed no I know there are songs ever

8008.85 --> 8014.27
since hold on they are fixed within the

8011.46 --> 8016.619
framework of the pattern

8014.27 --> 8019.35
yeah but they could also be reacting to

8016.619 --> 8021.299999999999
like an electromagnetic charge that's

8019.35 --> 8025.83
being passed through and they could be

8021.3 --> 8027.75
reacting to like he knows my wandering

8025.83 --> 8030.21
star you're talking about planets right

8027.75 --> 8032.489
the wandering yes right so they are

8030.21 --> 8035.699
fixed absolutely within the framework of

8032.489 --> 8038.879999999999
it all absolutely there is no thing you

8035.699 --> 8040.65
could cause to make these stars and

8038.88 --> 8043.1990000000005
their apparent their angular relations

8040.65 --> 8048.179
this place there's no way you could

8043.199 --> 8050.5199999999995
change that you know that right there's

8048.179 --> 8054.09
no record of their ever changing their

8050.52 --> 8055.77
trajectory or anything well I'm trying

8054.09 --> 8057.889
to avoid any are well we can't we can't

8055.77 --> 8061.4400000000005
wiggle the plan that's okay we're doing

8057.889 --> 8067.52
well that that for one but neither like

8061.44 --> 8071.73
make do some kind of I don't know some

8067.52 --> 8074.52
ancient tech high electrics thingy is a

8071.73 --> 8077.159
giant electromagnetic field and then

8074.52 --> 8081.06
cause the heavenly bodies to deviate

8077.159 --> 8082.86
somehow no it's never been recorded the

8081.06 --> 8086.280000000001
Sun does some weird [ __ ] sometimes

8082.86 --> 8090.119
though but but never a pathway the

8086.28 --> 8092.67
pathway is always constant I'll have to

8090.119 --> 8095.8099999999995
double check that I think there is

8092.67 --> 8095.81
different motions

8097.03 --> 8107.44
go ahead go ahead matrix you were saying

8104.17 --> 8111.09
oh no no no I was talking to somebody

8107.44 --> 8115.66
else I'm sorry all right

8111.09 --> 8117.37
but yeah I don't think that the I think

8115.66 --> 8118.72
that the entire globe of the heavens

8117.37 --> 8120.88
including the Sun and the moon are

8118.72 --> 8126.13
purely a holographic in nature they are

8120.88 --> 8129.43
parents things lights at a specific

8126.13 --> 8131.47
pattern at the apparent edge of vision

8129.43 --> 8133.4800000000005
that's what I think it is and that would

8131.47 --> 8138.900000000001
format my globe naturally around an

8133.48 --> 8141.219999999999
observer and yeah it's very confusing

8138.9 --> 8142.839999999999
when you try the size of other things

8141.22 --> 8145.72
but it just has nothing to do with

8142.84 --> 8152.650000000001
anything physical it's purely optical

8145.72 --> 8154.27
and right what I wasn't gonna say right

8152.65 --> 8160.7699999999995
it doesn't have anything to do with any

8154.27 --> 8163.4800000000005
physical dome I've heard of all physical

8160.77 --> 8165.820000000001
structural relation because if there was

8163.48 --> 8171.07
a direct structural relation then you

8165.82 --> 8176.82
would see shifts within the approach of

8171.07 --> 8180.25
the curve above as you move so like very

8176.82 --> 8182.679999999999
dramatically in in how they appear to us

8180.25 --> 8185.26
it would be very unlikely to always see

8182.68 --> 8187.27
it as a demagogue exactly like a demo

8185.26 --> 8189.49
globe things would start to distort if

8187.27 --> 8192.970000000001
you would move more to the edge of a

8189.49 --> 8196.57
dome is what I presume if it would even

8192.97 --> 8198.13
be visible at all absolute ironore

8196.57 --> 8200.89
languidly out there that's looking at

8198.13 --> 8203.05
the sky selectively causing it like as

8200.89 --> 8205.96
it were it would be very likely you

8203.05 --> 8209.65
would even only be able to see it from a

8205.96 --> 8213.189999999999
very specific position very small really

8209.65 --> 8216.609999999999
a relatively small location within the

8213.19 --> 8218.41
disk beneath that reflective them in

8216.61 --> 8222.769
order to get the holographic effect

8218.41 --> 8225.389
right see

8222.769 --> 8227.729
so I don't think there is any physical

8225.389 --> 8230.989
dumb relations to the yeah what causes

8227.729 --> 8233.55
the the globe of the heaven light

8230.989 --> 8236.609
manifestations that's what that's what I

8233.55 --> 8242.389
think well do you not agree that has to

8236.609 --> 8250.439
be some kind of membrane membrane

8242.389 --> 8255.389
I think he is a so all you're saying

8250.439 --> 8256.95
like something that they can't pass yeah

8255.389 --> 8258.96
there has to be a barrier high barrier

8256.95 --> 8260.67
sumo well that's what I've been trying

8258.96 --> 8262.348999999998
to say this is an entire community out

8260.67 --> 8266.309
there that is looking at the sky I'm

8262.349 --> 8268.59
would like a with like a half semi glass

8266.309 --> 8269.819
dome thing with a mirror and they're

8268.59 --> 8271.769
starting to look and they're starting to

8269.819 --> 8276.24
see weird things up there like here's

8271.769 --> 8277.460000000001
like how the stars moving gears yeah

8276.24 --> 8280.83
[Music]

8277.46 --> 8282.809
this guy called demon hunter he looks

8280.83 --> 8285.12
that's all he does is look at the sky

8282.809 --> 8287.33
and trust interpret the things that he

8285.12 --> 8291.179
talked about was kind of out there yeah

8287.33 --> 8294.42
sounds like it yeah out there but is

8291.179 --> 8298.83
real there's no mechanical workings up

8294.42 --> 8301.710000000001
there trust me no no clock works but

8298.83 --> 8304.2
there may be a barrier I've theorized

8301.71 --> 8307.108999999999
about this very extensively what could

8304.2 --> 8308.939
be up there wait so always what you what

8307.109 --> 8311.25
you're saying is you don't think the

8308.939 --> 8316.219000000001
stars are actually part of the physical

8311.25 --> 8320.67
barrier like it's like Riley was nobody

8316.219 --> 8323.098999999998
hella scope and in this group nobody has

8320.67 --> 8325.95
a powerful telescope other than a p900

8323.099 --> 8328.019
it'll be one battle to get one like

8325.95 --> 8331.800000000001
nobody has that's made the purchase yet

8328.019 --> 8335.519
no no no big I'm flattered fur wow crow

8331.8 --> 8337.438999999998
has pretty incredible telescope how far

8335.519 --> 8341.069
is the capability like what is he able

8337.439 --> 8344.609
to see it not to see or yes did you ask

8341.069 --> 8346.59
him I don't know because it's kind of

8344.609 --> 8348.45
its kind of weird that nobody has done

8346.59 --> 8350.939
that nobody has aim as much as possible

8348.45 --> 8352.769
to the sky or maybe that's all there is

8350.939 --> 8355.550000000001
to see but I just told you crow

8352.769 --> 8357.769
definitely has an incredible

8355.55 --> 8361.819
let's go very expensive set up that he

8357.769 --> 8364.399
applied so I mean people have done

8361.819 --> 8367.219
close-ups of the Stars and you know they

8364.399 --> 8369.59
don't look they don't they just look

8367.219 --> 8372.5
like little plasma lights dancing in

8369.59 --> 8374.0
water or something I mean oh yeah that's

8372.5 --> 8375.859
what they look like I've seen them I

8374.0 --> 8377.99
have a couple of recordings of the sky

8375.859 --> 8380.51
of the of the scholars you can't capture

8377.99 --> 8382.269
them and sometimes the camera starts

8380.51 --> 8384.74
acting funny

8382.269 --> 8387.34
it's weird it's weird what happens when

8384.74 --> 8391.369999999999
you try to record these things right but

8387.34 --> 8395.42
beside that look there's just abundance

8391.37 --> 8397.490000000002
of an abundance of evidence that if you

8395.42 --> 8401.149
go up high enough they just disappear

8397.49 --> 8403.819
disappear altogether and even directly

8401.149 --> 8407.66
related to the moon landings they just

8403.819 --> 8410.63
said yeah no that we didn't see stars so

8407.66 --> 8415.7
even even the priesthood themselves say

8410.63 --> 8417.38
it never corrected it and then they made

8415.7 --> 8420.83
up these weird that you need the

8417.38 --> 8423.649
atmosphere in order to see it which

8420.83 --> 8426.35
makes no damn sense well there are these

8423.649 --> 8433.63
things called bucky balls that could

8426.35 --> 8437.18
maybe explain stars what why carbon

8433.63 --> 8440.42
based physical molecule have to do with

8437.18 --> 8442.58
stars well these are big on big round

8440.42 --> 8444.56
kind of metal things that just fall

8442.58 --> 8447.109
randomly from the sky that's not a

8444.56 --> 8449.119999999999
buckyball that's what they call a book

8447.109 --> 8452.479000000001
that's not a buckyball a buckyball is a

8449.12 --> 8455.660000000002
very specific type of chemical carbon

8452.479 --> 8457.34
atom okay but these these things that

8455.66 --> 8462.289999999999
fall from the sky that's the name

8457.34 --> 8464.960000000001
they've put to them that's because the

8462.29 --> 8468.319000000001
stone drops as it were yeah that's that

8464.96 --> 8469.699999999999
weird freaky [ __ ] okay good but let me

8468.319 --> 8472.76
get into that for a moment

8469.7 --> 8476.33
are you talking about Co Co above us

8472.76 --> 8478.52
yeah it could even technically be haha

8476.33 --> 8482.3
in my looping concept it could be the

8478.52 --> 8484.069000000001
bottom of our earth like Elysium like a

8482.3 --> 8487.31
li geom kind of world something like

8484.069 --> 8488.391
that now looping literally so think we

8487.31 --> 8491.301
look from left or

8488.391 --> 8493.73
we loop from front to back and from up

8491.301 --> 8498.760999999999
to down for example for example you

8493.73 --> 8501.020999999999
wouldn't all the way north is above us

8498.761 --> 8503.54
so what you're saying is instead of

8501.021 --> 8505.311000000002
going around in like a sphere what you

8503.54 --> 8508.130000000001
say you go in one side and pop out the

8505.311 --> 8511.88
other side like an Mario right in Mario

8508.13 --> 8514.039999999999
or pac-man that's so creepy [ __ ] yeah

8511.88 --> 8523.58
and in the trainman station in the

8514.04 --> 8526.641000000001
matrix you say you a lawyer right mm-hm

8523.58 --> 8528.891
qualified no practicing what is what

8526.641 --> 8530.96
have you heard of the situation with the

8528.891 --> 8534.591
two birth certificates and the corporate

8530.96 --> 8537.08
wards and the state ward yeah that's

8534.591 --> 8539.051
right that that it's great it's not true

8537.08 --> 8540.38
yeah yeah that's that's true

8539.051 --> 8543.13
twenty-eight your birth certificate

8540.38 --> 8546.350999999999
that's your inscription into the system

8543.13 --> 8548.9
Wow then they can actually buy you as a

8546.351 --> 8550.431
corporate that's a corporation this is

8548.9 --> 8552.17
why they're able to take in you and

8550.431 --> 8556.58
force you to get a license and all that

8552.17 --> 8558.41
yeah absolutely right that does appear

8556.58 --> 8560.12
to be true yeah I don't know for

8558.41 --> 8562.011
absolute certainty than it is true but

8560.12 --> 8563.931
it does the language the language that

8562.011 --> 8565.94
they used like when they say do you

8563.931 --> 8568.04
understand they don't mean do you get

8565.94 --> 8570.980000000001
what I'm saying they mean do you stand

8568.04 --> 8574.851
by these charges to do a septum correct

8570.98 --> 8576.32
do you standing on wheels so they have a

8574.851 --> 8581.24
quick question while you're on that

8576.32 --> 8583.789999999999
topic is the contract voided because you

8581.24 --> 8585.771
didn't consent to it you were a baby how

8583.79 --> 8587.54
could you consent to something there are

8585.771 --> 8589.971000000001
steps that you have to take to be able

8587.54 --> 8592.37
to avoid that contract but it is

8589.971 --> 8594.74
possible this is why certain people in

8592.37 --> 8597.79
the past have been killed for divulging

8594.74 --> 8601.94
this for teaching the the public how to

8597.79 --> 8604.7
expatriate from the corporation what I

8601.94 --> 8607.28
do know is that there is somebody that's

8604.7 --> 8612.86
within the community that is doing

8607.28 --> 8614.78
something very very important and you'll

8612.86 --> 8617.0
find out within the next month and if it

8614.78 --> 8618.591
happens there's gonna be a very

8617.0 --> 8620.271
interesting conversation that's going to

8618.591 --> 8622.101
happen as a result of it which will be

8620.271 --> 8625.070000000002
why do we have burst if

8622.101 --> 8626.66
it is fraud and we nobody ascribes to

8625.07 --> 8629.601
this you know and they're calling us by

8626.66 --> 8630.98
the wrong name correct the names that

8629.601 --> 8633.471000000001
they call us the name on your birth

8630.98 --> 8636.74
certificate is not even us is destroying

8633.471 --> 8640.461
the Eligius right it's corporate play

8636.74 --> 8642.94
but can I insert a tip so if in a court

8640.461 --> 8646.57
system they ask you do you understand

8642.94 --> 8649.61
you don't reply with yes you say I

8646.57 --> 8652.581
comprehend because that is what you're

8649.61 --> 8654.831
literally thinking you're responding to

8652.581 --> 8656.751
so just say okay I didn't say yes that's

8654.831 --> 8660.171
my name because as soon as you accept

8656.751 --> 8662.57
the name your ass they're unifying you

8660.171 --> 8664.431
guys so they she looks at the name as

8662.57 --> 8668.211
they read any capital letters which is

8664.431 --> 8671.091
literally nothing it's higher glyph yeah

8668.211 --> 8674.270999999999
capital letters is not a language do you

8671.091 --> 8680.78
guys get what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah

8674.271 --> 8683.211000000001
that you carry the whole thing about the

8680.78 --> 8685.581
others understand you can continue the

8683.211 --> 8689.811
conversation if they didn't take it

8685.581 --> 8692.421
don't take it but going to re-ask like

8689.811 --> 8695.9
do you understand and you say yeah I I

8692.421 --> 8698.03
comprehend what you're saying and if

8695.9 --> 8701.98
they then don't reply to that then they

8698.03 --> 8705.081
know they need yes they need the

8701.98 --> 8707.331
understanding well they try to trick you

8705.081 --> 8707.841
any like they try to ask you do you have

8707.331 --> 8710.271
money

8707.841 --> 8711.831
and if you're and if you're trying to

8710.271 --> 8713.24
fight for your rights and you say yes I

8711.831 --> 8715.581
have money that that would make you a

8713.24 --> 8717.949999999999
perjure because there is no money money

8715.581 --> 8719.841
is all the gold and silver so the judge

8717.95 --> 8721.94
asks you that question to make you fall

8719.841 --> 8725.421
under his jurisdiction see these people

8721.94 --> 8726.86
are very tricky they're very tricky and

8725.421 --> 8729.141
there is right there if they're leading

8726.86 --> 8730.61
us to the slaughter like we do we look

8729.141 --> 8732.681
at them like they're people of Honor

8730.61 --> 8737.541000000001
they're not people of Honor there are

8732.681 --> 8738.44
things I totally agree they make us call

8737.541 --> 8741.051
them your honor

8738.44 --> 8743.841
what kind of how is it honorable to

8741.051 --> 8745.520999999999
steal from the people yeah it does

8743.841 --> 8747.291000000001
appear to be true I think it's a very

8745.521 --> 8749.541000000001
it's in its infancy at the moment but it

8747.291 --> 8751.971
is it is definitely being challenged as

8749.541 --> 8753.439999999999
we speak and in the next matter a lot of

8751.971 --> 8755.511
people there's a lot of people talking

8753.44 --> 8755.989000000001
about this no there's actually a

8755.511 --> 8757.52
challenge

8755.989 --> 8759.198999999999
is going in through European Court right

8757.52 --> 8762.049
now within the next month you'll hear

8759.199 --> 8764.779
about it if it's successful it's to do

8762.049 --> 8766.399000000001
with how you're referenced in court how

8764.779 --> 8770.839
they named you and how they refer to you

8766.399 --> 8774.439
in court well the icer I serve which is

8770.839 --> 8776.149
putting you with the Eligius got your

8774.439 --> 8777.68
given name is the man that your mother

8776.149 --> 8780.788999999999
gave you and they're supposed to call

8777.68 --> 8783.109
you is your last name comma your name

8780.789 --> 8785.899000000001
capital letter your last name and

8783.109 --> 8789.169
capital letter your name and lowercase

8785.899 --> 8791.778999999999
everything not how they write it your

8789.169 --> 8793.369
first middle and last that's not how

8791.779 --> 8796.549
that's a bastardized version of your

8793.369 --> 8799.220000000001
name that isn't you correct it in every

8796.549 --> 8802.069000000001
public school they have taught us how to

8799.22 --> 8804.47
call yourself like when they call you

8802.069 --> 8807.319
sir come over here they're training you

8804.47 --> 8808.97
to accept this language and the other

8807.319 --> 8810.859
thing is if you fill in a form manually

8808.97 --> 8812.688999999998
they always put blah capsules it in

8810.859 --> 8814.999
brackets after where it says name and

8812.689 --> 8817.249
then it says block capitals technically

8814.999 --> 8821.149
everything in brackets doesn't exist or

8817.249 --> 8823.878999999999
isn't there and everywhere everything

8821.149 --> 8825.979
that you like when you go to a bank like

8823.879 --> 8828.109
in the indent when it says some sign on

8825.979 --> 8830.06
the line when you look at the line it's

8828.109 --> 8832.579
not an actual line it's something called

8830.06 --> 8834.798999999999
micro print and it says authorized

8832.579 --> 8836.869
representative you're the authorized

8834.799 --> 8839.720000000001
representative of the strongman of the

8836.869 --> 8842.779
name of the card because they know that

8839.72 --> 8844.698999999999
is a legal fiction they know that it

8842.779 --> 8846.68
cannot sign for ourselves so it needs

8844.699 --> 8855.560000000001
the authorized representative which is

8846.68 --> 8857.299
the you complex bureaucracy tactics

8855.56 --> 8859.669
basically no but this is this is

8857.299 --> 8861.560000000001
absolutely real though like it is this

8859.669 --> 8863.539
there's no conspiracy about it it's just

8861.56 --> 8865.909
we don't know about it because we've

8863.539 --> 8868.909000000001
been trained not to see but it's in our

8865.909 --> 8871.069
face the thing is it is kind of

8868.909 --> 8873.378999999999
unnatural to deal with this kind of

8871.069 --> 8876.109
thing to humans it doesn't come natural

8873.379 --> 8880.1
because they are fictionalizing sub

8876.109 --> 8882.649000000001
frameworks and using it in their system

8880.1 --> 8884.81
and people don't get a good feel for

8882.649 --> 8889.020999999999
that unless they are very thoroughly

8884.81 --> 8892.051
trained to do so and yeah they

8889.021 --> 8895.320000000002
just use that they use that that very

8892.051 --> 8897.449999999999
much glass so they everything can just

8895.32 --> 8900.181
proceed without constantly being

8897.45 --> 8903.391000000001
interrupted by people that disagree with

8900.181 --> 8906.421
everything so I think that is right it

8903.391 --> 8912.511
is the way it is but yeah it's being

8906.421 --> 8915.57
abused by them a lot the best slave is a

8912.511 --> 8925.2
slave that thinks he's free I get the

8915.57 --> 8931.08
best card absolutely Oh Flat Earth

8925.2 --> 8943.230000000001
anybody what curve wait listen Harry I

8931.08 --> 8952.74
don't know that's level like is anybody

8943.23 --> 8955.41
you're planning a trip or something oh I

8952.74 --> 8961.11
don't have any money for that kind of

8955.41 --> 8963.119999999999
thing just yet quite eventually if yeah

8961.11 --> 8966.12
we could ever reach that point sure I've

8963.12 --> 8968.79
plenty of plans and all kinds of

8966.12 --> 8974.311000000002
financial skills but you have to

8968.79 --> 8978.03
actually get there so although I I may

8974.311 --> 8981.211
not agree with the conferences but I do

8978.03 --> 8983.400000000001
want to go there too just to meet these

8981.211 --> 8986.33
humans that I've been conversating with

8983.4 --> 8991.41
and that's the only reason I want to go

8986.33 --> 8992.851
so I don't know how anybody else tells

8991.41 --> 8996.961
about that but I just want to meet

8992.851 --> 9000.711000000001
people right well are you coming to the

8996.961 --> 9002.689999999999
Amsterdam meetup in September not in it

9000.711 --> 9007.4
but I am going to Dallas cuz I live

9002.69 --> 9010.19
right next to time I am down there can

9007.4 --> 9011.931
you come to Dallas or what what no no

9010.19 --> 9015.351
after them I'm going there in September

9011.931 --> 9017.899000000001
definitely so if you want to meet Arwen

9015.351 --> 9022.32
face to face

9017.899 --> 9025.56
that's your chance I'm not going in a

9022.32 --> 9030.449999999999
wizard outfit I always do want to go out

9025.56 --> 9034.83
to Amsterdam though I can't lie yeah I

9030.45 --> 9037.439
can imagine white chocolate it could be

9034.83 --> 9038.85
one of three or maybe all three reasons

9037.439 --> 9050.64
that everyone goes to Amsterdam fall

9038.85 --> 9056.37
right right you live once right I'm

9050.64 --> 9059.31
doing palace only only if you find

9056.37 --> 9062.130000000001
George Moussa well words fight the

9059.31 --> 9064.109
further from is from out there by you he

9062.13 --> 9067.5
was born in Bristol UK but lives in

9064.109 --> 9068.58
Scotland and obviously you gag I don't

9067.5 --> 9069.81
know why anybody would want to go to

9068.58 --> 9071.34
Scotland and live there it's the most

9069.81 --> 9072.39
wet miserable country ever but it's

9071.34 --> 9074.880000000001
beautiful if you live in the highlands

9072.39 --> 9076.68
boy it's it's wet miserable and dreary

9074.88 --> 9080.849999999999
generally it's from walking and it's

9076.68 --> 9083.189
freezing as well has he given you the

9080.85 --> 9087.99
data yet over on our when he measured

9083.189 --> 9091.460000000001
the Sun the Sun just keep asking him

9087.99 --> 9094.14
where in the world is George Moussa

9091.46 --> 9097.05
what's this George Moussa thing right I

9094.14 --> 9099.72
didn't really hear it and I did get a

9097.05 --> 9103.59
chance to watch a video so what is wrong

9099.72 --> 9105.269999999999
I cited George Moussa in a citation the

9103.59 --> 9107.880000000001
he claims are misrepresented or

9105.27 --> 9109.95
misunderstood or both and I said don't

9107.88 --> 9111.779999999999
be ridiculous so we made a claim that he

9109.95 --> 9113.91
was gonna interview George Moussa like

9111.78 --> 9116.189
two three weeks ago and to prove that

9113.91 --> 9118.2
I'd misunderstood what was written now

9116.189 --> 9120.27
it's literally says in black white that

9118.2 --> 9123.03
he snaps the wand into of gravity

9120.27 --> 9124.83
Einstein snaps the gravitational force

9123.03 --> 9127.49
but the force of gravitation between

9124.83 --> 9130.68
masses he's nuts that magic wand into

9127.49 --> 9132.51
can't get it any more clear now I'm not

9130.68 --> 9134.01
necessarily the brightest to bloke on

9132.51 --> 9136.050000000001
the earth but I'm definitely not done

9134.01 --> 9137.399
and I understand what that means and he

9136.05 --> 9139.32
reckons I've misunderstood it and he

9137.399 --> 9142.41
also reckons I miss it misinterpreting

9139.32 --> 9144.81
or misrepresenting what Moussa says so

9142.41 --> 9146.49
I've said right okay prove it so he said

9144.81 --> 9147.93
he's gonna do this interview now this

9146.49 --> 9150.24
was like three week to three weeks ago

9147.93 --> 9150.78
and I mean I how long do you give it

9150.24 --> 9153.24
before you

9150.78 --> 9154.650000000001
to be too long I think two to three

9153.24 --> 9155.91
weeks is more than long enough how long

9154.65 --> 9157.8
would it take him to ring him and ask

9155.91 --> 9160.08
him five five minute interview on the

9157.8 --> 9162.48
phone and this guy's claiming your work

9160.08 --> 9163.83
says this is that what it says and if

9162.48 --> 9165.99
it's not what it says what does it mean

9163.83 --> 9167.431
I'm literally a five-minute conversation

9165.99 --> 9169.289999999999
and I think he could have done it easily

9167.431 --> 9171.09
within two weeks but before ever reason

9169.29 --> 9173.431
he hasn't done it so I was asking him

9171.09 --> 9175.59
where is he where is this interview but

9173.431 --> 9177.0
when I was a kid the the Cameron son I

9175.59 --> 9179.28
don't know if anybody remembers Carmen

9177.0 --> 9181.021
Sandiego but it was a cartoon and the

9179.28 --> 9183.99
Easter play where in the world is Carmen

9181.021 --> 9185.19
Sandiego I remember that yeah yeah she

9183.99 --> 9186.75
being like rolling when the bead the

9185.19 --> 9188.94
Leaning Tower of Pisa in the background

9186.75 --> 9191.82
or whatever and if that really was the

9188.94 --> 9193.2
case sorry because that song was there

9191.82 --> 9194.789999999999
and remembered it and I just thought it

9193.2 --> 9198.061000000002
would work that with George Moussa but

9194.79 --> 9199.95
Carmen Sandiego six syllables seven

9198.061 --> 9202.681
syllables right so I need like a long

9199.95 --> 9204.09
name but unfortunately George Moussa is

9202.681 --> 9205.95
only three syllables or anything like

9204.09 --> 9207.87
another at least two or three syllables

9205.95 --> 9209.91
to get it in there so I had to call him

9207.87 --> 9212.130000000001
George [ __ ] Moussa so I could get

9209.91 --> 9214.41
more syllables into it so it fit what

9212.13 --> 9216.359999999999
point is that he needs to produce its

9214.41 --> 9218.101
habeas corpus he's claimed that there's

9216.36 --> 9219.33
going to be an interview and that I'm

9218.101 --> 9221.28
gonna be proved wrong

9219.33 --> 9222.69
well I'm alright either way because if

9221.28 --> 9224.761
George Moussa says that I've

9222.69 --> 9226.32
misunderstood him then his article

9224.761 --> 9228.78
misleads people that are intelligent

9226.32 --> 9231.99
enough to be able to read it and I'm not

9228.78 --> 9233.91
done and even if I misunderstood it his

9231.99 --> 9236.07
article is written in such a way that is

9233.91 --> 9237.539999999999
capable of misunderstanding what he's

9236.07 --> 9239.67
trying to make the point he's trying to

9237.54 --> 9241.92
make but I don't think that he'll agree

9239.67 --> 9244.021
with Craig I think that he'll not do the

9241.92 --> 9245.55
interview because I think that he's not

9244.021 --> 9248.011
going to professionally commit suicide

9245.55 --> 9249.779999999999
with Craig fight the flat earth because

9248.011 --> 9251.73
he's gonna clearly contradict himself

9249.78 --> 9254.150000000001
which then inadvertently and

9251.73 --> 9257.49
accidentally contradicts Brian Cox and

9254.15 --> 9260.221
Caltech and a documentary that I cited

9257.49 --> 9262.471
in in support of what Musa was saying

9260.221 --> 9264.811
and but Craig thinks I've misunderstood

9262.471 --> 9266.91
and misinterpreted Musa no I don't think

9264.811 --> 9268.98
I have I multiplied gave four all the

9266.91 --> 9270.48
citations one of which was Musa himself

9268.98 --> 9272.82
a secondary article that moose are also

9270.48 --> 9275.73
said that basically said Einstein did

9272.82 --> 9278.011
replace Newtonian principles by 1920 his

9275.73 --> 9281.07
theory of relativity came out in 1915

9278.011 --> 9283.351
but by 1920 everybody basically accepted

9281.07 --> 9284.46
that it was it was Einstein Ian gravity

9283.351 --> 9287.01
rather than mute or

9284.46 --> 9288.869999999999
in gravitation and so I don't think that

9287.01 --> 9291.33
I've got this wrong it says in black and

9288.87 --> 9292.53
white with numerous citations and if I

9291.33 --> 9293.88
have got it wrong that it means that

9292.53 --> 9295.380000000001
George Moussa is not written his

9293.88 --> 9297.779999999999
document in a way that is clear enough

9295.38 --> 9299.31
for an average ly intelligent bloke to

9297.78 --> 9301.74
understand it because he literally says

9299.31 --> 9303.24
he snaps the wand into I don't think

9301.74 --> 9304.979
I've misunderstood that it literally

9303.24 --> 9306.3
says it's no longer Newtonian principles

9304.979 --> 9308.429999999998
of great because it literally says and

9306.3 --> 9310.769999999999
snaps the wand into he showed that it

9308.43 --> 9313.470000000001
was not in the force of attraction that

9310.77 --> 9315.51
is what gravity is he's really showed it

9313.47 --> 9317.369999999999
was the curvature in space-time so I

9315.51 --> 9319.5
don't accept that I've misunderstood or

9317.37 --> 9321.660000000002
misread or miss sighted him I think that

9319.5 --> 9323.91
if he miss if he said someone he didn't

9321.66 --> 9326.19
mean he should admit it and then retract

9323.91 --> 9329.28
his comment his vid is a articles in

9326.19 --> 9331.2
Scientific American and oh he can't

9329.28 --> 9332.52
admit he can't agree with Craig now I

9331.2 --> 9333.900000000001
don't really care which way around it is

9332.52 --> 9335.49
he's foot neither way cuz Craig's not

9333.9 --> 9337.02
gonna get support from him if he doesn't

9335.49 --> 9339.949999999999
want to commit suicide professionally

9337.02 --> 9342.84
and but alternatively I also think that

9339.95 --> 9344.820000000002
he doesn't want to address the point

9342.84 --> 9346.53
because I mean why would you nobody

9344.82 --> 9348.029999999999
would want to go be called to task on

9346.53 --> 9350.400000000001
somewhere especially with fight the Flat

9348.03 --> 9351.45
Earth he's an absolutely [ __ ] boy if

9350.4 --> 9351.9
somebody's gotta do something because

9351.45 --> 9353.550000000001
Clegg's

9351.9 --> 9355.17
Craig claimed it and I'm looking forward

9353.55 --> 9356.939999999999
to how they deal with this because I

9355.17 --> 9358.02
don't think Craig's gonna get moose'

9356.94 --> 9359.49
wrong because I don't think moose is

9358.02 --> 9360.93
gonna get involved in it because it's

9359.49 --> 9363.39
blatantly obvious that fact the Flat

9360.93 --> 9365.1
Earth is wrong now if he's not wrong

9363.39 --> 9366.599999999999
then I'm alright with being wrong but

9365.1 --> 9368.16
that that means that science is

9366.6 --> 9370.229000000001
contradicting itself because he's same

9368.16 --> 9372.18
one thing meaning the opposite and there

9370.229 --> 9374.67
are citations against him but either way

9372.18 --> 9377.12
either create creates and although I can

9374.67 --> 9380.460000000001
dick because he's not gonna go on or

9377.12 --> 9382.26
George Moussa is gonna go on and agree

9380.46 --> 9384.21
with him but then shoot himself in the

9382.26 --> 9387.03
foot because all the site ate all the

9384.21 --> 9388.859999999999
cited works I gave supported what Musa

9387.03 --> 9391.17
said he's now going to change his mind

9388.86 --> 9392.67
and then support Craig I don't think

9391.17 --> 9393.960000000001
Luce is gonna support some [ __ ] on

9392.67 --> 9395.7
the internet that thinks that I'm wrong

9393.96 --> 9397.979
on the Internet I think he's gonna say

9395.7 --> 9399.75
it's self explanatory by my work I don't

9397.979 --> 9401.13
even need to come on so that's why I'm

9399.75 --> 9402.75
putting pressure on Craig to see whether

9401.13 --> 9404.729
or not you can get this guy's to come on

9402.75 --> 9406.68
and then let's see what he does if he

9404.729 --> 9407.849999999999
claims that I've misunderstood it then

9406.68 --> 9409.800000000001
I'll say well why have you written the

9407.85 --> 9411.87
article saying blue and actually you

9409.8 --> 9413.729
mean red then that's surely written

9411.87 --> 9415.83
badly you should retract the article and

9413.729 --> 9417.33
rewrite it at least correct it because

9415.83 --> 9418.1
if it's misrepresentative and it's

9417.33 --> 9420.229
misunderstood

9418.1 --> 9421.79
people that let's be honest I've got a

9420.229 --> 9423.739
degree I've got a post graduate diploma

9421.79 --> 9425.210000000001
where I'm studying a master's I'm not

9423.739 --> 9427.64
after I know what it's peasant I

9425.21 --> 9429.438999999998
understand what it means so he can have

9427.64 --> 9430.789999999999
it both ways so that's why I'm pushing

9429.439 --> 9432.35
him on it because he's made a claim and

9430.79 --> 9436.609
I want to see proof that he's true and I

9432.35 --> 9438.979000000001
don't think he can core will it's so

9436.609 --> 9442.880000000001
funny that they're just scrambling to

9438.979 --> 9446.81
try to equate the two gravities and it's

9442.88 --> 9450.17
like guys I mean even if he gets this

9446.81 --> 9453.109
monster guy to go back on what he said

9450.17 --> 9455.659
okay so then explain how you got people

9453.109 --> 9458.869
like Brian Cox telling you how different

9455.659 --> 9461.75
this gravity is when he says that Newton

9458.869 --> 9465.140000000001
knew and it's it's the Apple falling

9461.75 --> 9477.97
down but the ice on that that's terrif

9465.14 --> 9477.97
going up explain that guys I mean that's

9478.149 --> 9485.81
exactly Brian Cox is Einstein is saying

9484.159 --> 9487.729
that he didn't leave the apple fell to

9485.81 --> 9490.13
Newton's head Brian Cox says that

9487.729 --> 9491.84
Einstein believed that the the Newton

9490.13 --> 9493.399
went up to the Apple that's his

9491.84 --> 9497.119
relativity point that's what Cox

9493.399 --> 9499.849999999999
accessed in a lecture that he had yes

9497.119 --> 9503.060000000001
I've seen that so the perspective of

9499.85 --> 9507.159
falling or moving or because the earth

9503.06 --> 9515.06
is not literally dude okay yeah because

9507.159 --> 9518.659
yeah see it's all nonsense so yeah enjoy

9515.06 --> 9521.649
that you could create a theoretical

9518.659 --> 9527.239
constructs to explain the apparent

9521.649 --> 9529.519999999999
downward acceleration yeah or what is it

9527.239 --> 9533.779
Deford apparent force this equilibrium

9529.52 --> 9535.85
downwards and say it is just as if the

9533.779 --> 9539.569000000001
earth is accelerating up not claiming

9535.85 --> 9542.0
that it is but it that if it yes that

9539.569 --> 9544.22
that was his explanation loss and things

9542.0 --> 9547.609
pay something that is exactly like what

9544.22 --> 9549.5
is currently present assumed yeah and

9547.609 --> 9551.960000000001
that's not what Cox did what Cox did was

9549.5 --> 9553.85
cite Einstein here and his words were I

9551.96 --> 9555.83
who thought that the Apple didn't go to

9553.85 --> 9558.95
Newton he thought that the the earth

9555.83 --> 9560.45
went opted to the Apple that Cox was

9558.95 --> 9562.52
citing what he claims

9560.45 --> 9563.960000000001
Einstein thought now whether or not

9562.52 --> 9566.390000000001
that's true or not who cares the point

9563.96 --> 9568.759999999998
is that it contradicts what loses us no

9566.39 --> 9570.769999999999
sorry it supports what Moussa says at

9568.76 --> 9572.06
least in his document so if a Moose's

9570.77 --> 9573.470000000001
I'm gonna go back on that he's gonna

9572.06 --> 9575.21
have to explain well why do the other

9573.47 --> 9577.189999999999
documents what you're saying in your

9575.21 --> 9579.14
article then you now change your mind

9577.19 --> 9581.03
worried that he's basically then siding

9579.14 --> 9582.289999999999
with Craig for some reason and I don't

9581.03 --> 9583.49
think he'll do it I think that he'll

9582.29 --> 9587.150000000001
stand by what he said or he'll just

9583.49 --> 9589.55
deliberately not do the interview and it

9587.15 --> 9592.609999999999
was great i trolled their article from

9589.55 --> 9596.479
what was it Scientific American yeah

9592.61 --> 9602.18
yeah yeah yeah hey mister would you

9596.479 --> 9604.609999999999
flight career I'll that's it with this

9602.18 --> 9606.53
guy by going on back on his own words

9604.61 --> 9608.75
like come on I tell you what I'll do

9606.53 --> 9612.800000000001
I'll put the paper in chat so everyone

9608.75 --> 9614.6
can see it and how there we go

9612.8 --> 9616.13
so if anybody wants to see his words

9614.6 --> 9618.08
that I'm referring to it's quite clear

9616.13 --> 9619.609999999999
what he actually says and if you think

9618.08 --> 9622.1
of missile understood it feel free to

9619.61 --> 9625.34
send me some abuse and maybe you support

9622.1 --> 9627.02
me feel free to support me and there's

9625.34 --> 9630.68
the link on oh and you should you should

9627.02 --> 9636.2
find that that Brian Cox snip it and

9630.68 --> 9639.800000000001
play about it so that people can hear it

9636.2 --> 9650.84
play that crap yeah joints player we're

9639.8 --> 9652.519999999999
not passing sound through oh wait well I

9650.84 --> 9657.44
did it in my own video bar can give the

9652.52 --> 9659.630000000001
link if you want it's up to you let's

9657.44 --> 9661.16
see well you can try it I didn't get a

9659.63 --> 9663.679999999998
copyright strike for it when I did it

9661.16 --> 9666.86
okay well present it through your screen

9663.68 --> 9668.51
if you can okay I'll play off my video

9666.86 --> 9670.19
cuz then the copyright is with me then

9668.51 --> 9673.67
isn't it it's not with him and I didn't

9670.19 --> 9674.62
get a copyright strike for it so it

9673.67 --> 9678.460000000001
works

9674.62 --> 9678.460000000001
bear with me won't find it

9686.351 --> 9701.300000000001
as long as there's no music in it no

9692.42 --> 9702.8
there's no music in it here it is right

9701.3 --> 9704.119999999999
so I needs a screen sure

9702.8 --> 9707.350999999999
wow it's been a while since I've done

9704.12 --> 9716.0
one of these what where's my window gone

9707.351 --> 9720.43
um deadlies alright so honest share my

9716.0 --> 9720.43
window and it should be the one that has

9722.11 --> 9728.271
it be the one that's got that in the

9724.43 --> 9736.67
back rasa's should be that one right

9728.271 --> 9738.710000000001
have you got it on screen Howard so not

9736.67 --> 9739.97
yet yeah I'm just gonna make sure that

9738.71 --> 9742.359999999999
I'm on the right window can you see me

9739.97 --> 9746.24
now exhibit 5 over 5 yeah

9742.36 --> 9753.17
okay so let me just turn on the sound so

9746.24 --> 9758.061
it passes through should work now

9753.17 --> 9760.101
you ready yeah yeah as ambition it was

9758.061 --> 9763.369999999999
interested in math what what is how do I

9760.101 --> 9766.130000000001
explain that that led to essentially a

9763.37 --> 9768.44
geometric theory of gravity which is

9766.13 --> 9771.92
that there isn't really a force of

9768.44 --> 9775.04
gravity at all what there is is the

9771.92 --> 9777.710000000001
curvature of space and time because it

9775.04 --> 9780.2
already merged those together in 1905 so

9777.71 --> 9785.600999999999
the bending or curvature of space and

9780.2 --> 9789.17
time by mass of now site that was one of

9785.601 --> 9798.29
them I like after did the other bit of

9789.17 --> 9800.33
it where is that citation never give me

9798.29 --> 9805.460000000001
a minute John wants yourselves wanna

9800.33 --> 9808.28
find it all right I know an original

9805.46 --> 9811.939999999999
video I think it starts at about 7/16

9808.28 --> 9814.24
something seventeen minutes if it's the

9811.94 --> 9822.65
same video that you got it out of

9814.24 --> 9825.17
so I remember I go right to that like he

9822.65 --> 9825.83
just said it right yo you're heard him

9825.17 --> 9830.95
just say

9825.83 --> 9834.37
gravity's not a force at all right right

9830.95 --> 9836.480000000001
that's what I heard yeah he did say that

9834.37 --> 9841.970000000001
what is the relative it's the relative

9836.48 --> 9843.38
point that I wanted to try and find that

9841.97 --> 9845.33
one word is he's at University of

9843.38 --> 9847.82
Manchester where Mick West got his

9845.33 --> 9849.74
degree from in I think it was computer

9847.82 --> 9851.51
science can't remember what it was that

9849.74 --> 9860.5
he got his degree in but that's where

9851.51 --> 9862.94
Mike went ohmy quest oh yeah I remember

9860.5 --> 9867.7
it's a good song that I think that's one

9862.94 --> 9867.7
of his best ones come on where is he

9876.49 --> 9880.51
come on where is that interview

9887.539 --> 9895.069000000001
chocolate are do I find that video now

9889.369 --> 9897.460000000001
right gravity Einstein I'm saying

9895.069 --> 9897.46
gravity

9898.749 --> 9904.01
I'm hoping the thumbnail has got the set

9902.329 --> 9908.21
in there cuz it's like a bluey know if

9904.01 --> 9916.960000000001
you've got the words first in the search

9908.21 --> 9916.96
it suggested Einstein gravity so see

9917.77 --> 9922.550000000001
obviously Brian Cox is very young there

9920.09 --> 9924.079
look at the same video I I think it's

9922.55 --> 9928.099999999999
that video yeah I think you just had to

9924.079 --> 9929.569
let it play which one oh the one mmm you

9928.1 --> 9931.130000000001
were playing it the one that you were

9929.569 --> 9933.56
playing where he way he was sitting down

9931.13 --> 9936.229
speaking that's the one I think we just

9933.56 --> 9937.609
need to let it right clicked out and put

9936.229 --> 9944.3
into my video I can't remember what

9937.609 --> 9946.189
sauce oh thank you gaining wisdom for

9944.3 --> 9959.899
the $2 shipper chat donation much

9946.189 --> 9962.899
appreciated a second it is in practice

9959.899 --> 9966.618999999999
fine is there ever a that there is no

9962.899 --> 9968.72
such because they support your two

9966.619 --> 9970.369
previous articles yeah that's right

9968.72 --> 9974.149
I do know this clip I can't remember

9970.369 --> 9975.710000000001
where it is gravity which is the there

9974.149 --> 9980.14
isn't really a force of gravity at all

9975.71 --> 9982.519999999999
what there is is the curvature of space

9980.14 --> 9984.499
so it mean is literally saying that

9982.52 --> 9986.569000000001
there isn't really a force of gravity at

9984.499 --> 9988.46
all there is the curvature of space well

9986.569 --> 9990.198999999999
that directly supports what Musa wrote

9988.46 --> 9992.089999999998
in his article so I don't think new sir

9990.199 --> 9993.439
is gonna side with Craig sorry Gregor

9992.09 --> 9994.999
don't that's why I'm pushing you on it

9993.439 --> 9997.31
because I think that he's not gonna get

9994.999 --> 9998.18
involved in this and it Yogi's gonna

9997.31 --> 9999.948999999999
leave you hanging

9998.18 --> 10001.630000000001
it's like Neil you put your hand up for

9999.949 --> 10003.310000000001
a high-five and he's expecting mooses to

10001.63 --> 10005.108999999999
give him a high-five and batter me

10003.31 --> 10011.31
Lucia's gonna leave him hanging that's

10005.109 --> 10013.44
what I think's an orphan anyway

10011.31 --> 10016.38
you sure you're not gonna play the rest

10013.44 --> 10020.04
of that where he says he does really

10016.38 --> 10024.029999999999
he doesn't say yes oh okay and time

10020.04 --> 10026.070000000002
because they gather in 1905 so the the

10024.03 --> 10031.17
bending or curvature of space and time

10026.07 --> 10032.039999999999
by mass yeah you don't got it hold on

10031.17 --> 10034.02
hold on a second

10032.04 --> 10037.26
don't you have it on your computer as a

10034.02 --> 10039.060000000001
video file yeah get in it immediately on

10037.26 --> 10040.08
my on-demand isn't so what I can do

10039.06 --> 10042.21
easily because I can't remember what

10040.08 --> 10043.68
I've actually saved ass because I've had

10042.21 --> 10046.289999999999
I've downloaded the file of it obviously

10043.68 --> 10047.94
I have enough to make the video just

10046.29 --> 10050.550000000001
knowing what the file is about my hold

10047.94 --> 10053.49
really I'll send it to you on your

10050.55 --> 10056.57
escape in a second okay is it the URL or

10053.49 --> 10061.07
is it the video it's the YouTube video

10056.57 --> 10067.35
okay the whole video or the link for it

10061.07 --> 10072.74
it's the link for it cool all right I

10067.35 --> 10072.74
need two minutes

10082.629 --> 10092.739000000001
should really be able to find it isn't

10084.849 --> 10095.199
here somewhere what that's the one time

10092.739 --> 10097.989
how it curves so in a sense tells you

10095.199 --> 10100.27
the story or the history and future of a

10097.989 --> 10103.749
solar system is this the right time I'll

10100.27 --> 10106.419
go back to go back to like us like 16

10103.749 --> 10110.489
minutes it'll be where you played but

10106.419 --> 10110.489
just let it play for a little bit

10110.969 --> 10115.389
enjoyable and a fascinating journey you

10113.409 --> 10118.479
see you see it with him I mean the

10115.389 --> 10120.038999999999
modern cosmology is based on Einstein's

10118.479 --> 10122.618999999999
theory of general relativity which is a

10120.039 --> 10124.719000000001
theory of gravity so in that sense the

10122.619 --> 10126.969000000001
ambition of the theory was no greater

10124.719 --> 10128.919
really the Newton's it was to describe

10126.969 --> 10132.309
how objects moving in gravitational

10128.919 --> 10133.929
fields Newton and said the you know it's

10132.309 --> 10135.579
an apocryphal story actually but Newton

10133.929 --> 10137.289
said there's an apple fell onto his head

10135.579 --> 10138.788999999999
and why did he fall onto his head

10137.289 --> 10140.679
because there's a force pulling it down

10138.789 --> 10142.329000000002
and that force is proportional to the

10140.679 --> 10143.859
product and the mass of the earth and

10142.329 --> 10145.298999999999
the mass of the Apple and the square of

10143.859 --> 10147.849
the distance between them so that that

10145.299 --> 10152.169000000002
was the first universal law of nature

10147.849 --> 10155.259
1687 so a great step forward in 1915

10152.169 --> 10157.469
based on the thoughts that Einstein had

10155.259 --> 10159.339
had for actually a decade or more

10157.469 --> 10161.378999999999
Einstein produces a neat theory of

10159.339 --> 10163.27
gravity which to the summary the

10161.379 --> 10164.709
one-line summary is that the apple

10163.27 --> 10165.999
doesn't hit Newton on the head that

10164.709 --> 10168.279
because the earth pulls the Apple down

10165.999 --> 10170.02
the Apple hits Newton on the at the head

10168.279 --> 10173.619
because Newton accelerates upwards and

10170.02 --> 10178.899000000001
headbutts the Apple which was floated so

10173.619 --> 10182.049
right that's like 101 that in it like

10178.899 --> 10185.079
fly a society what a society [ __ ] and

10182.049 --> 10186.939
that's good guy yeah and cockt saying

10185.079 --> 10189.609
that guys so this is the gravity that

10186.939 --> 10192.999
you're defending all right well the

10189.609 --> 10194.949
space-time is let's put it back in the

10192.999 --> 10196.539
context of right the Flat Earth right II

10194.949 --> 10198.339
think fight the flat earth means site

10196.539 --> 10200.349
the current rhetoric right but this is

10198.339 --> 10202.029
what you gotta prove that George Moussa

10200.349 --> 10203.529
was not supported when he said what he

10202.029 --> 10204.819000000001
said in his document because that is

10203.529 --> 10207.039
exactly what he said he said he said

10204.819 --> 10210.219
that nine Stein's Newton Einstein's

10207.039 --> 10211.569000000001
gravity snapped the wand into by showing

10210.219 --> 10214.479
that it was the curvature of space-time

10211.569 --> 10216.22
and not a magical force that was

10214.479 --> 10218.708999999999
gravitational attraction now

10216.22 --> 10220.778999999999
you've got this guy citing the Einstein

10218.709 --> 10222.729000000001
believed that the Apple went didn't fall

10220.779 --> 10224.649000000001
from the tree where him that he went up

10222.729 --> 10226.72
to the Apple that's a relativity right

10224.649 --> 10228.97
that's the opposing position now

10226.72 --> 10230.948999999999
either way Moosa did say what he said in

10228.97 --> 10232.81
this document and it was cited by for

10230.949 --> 10235.449
all the citations one of which was Moosa

10232.81 --> 10237.64
and in support of himself and so he

10235.449 --> 10239.529
lucid has to go against what Cox is

10237.64 --> 10241.358999999999
saying here I if he's gonna support

10239.529 --> 10242.709
Craig I look forward to that because I

10241.359 --> 10244.749
don't think anybody is gonna go against

10242.709 --> 10246.550000000001
Brian Cox that's in the industry because

10244.749 --> 10249.489
he's got a mortgage to pay houses kids

10246.55 --> 10251.47
food and so let's see what he does let's

10249.489 --> 10252.819
see if Craig gets left hanging for a

10251.47 --> 10253.81
high-five that he's not gonna get

10252.819 --> 10260.399
because I don't think he's gonna get it

10253.81 --> 10260.399
I love that analogy of the highfather

10263.34 --> 10271.869
here we go it's interesting though

10270.31 --> 10273.31
because the technique that they use is

10271.869 --> 10275.140000000001
gas writing they try and make you feel

10273.31 --> 10276.97
as though you stupid now I've read that

10275.14 --> 10278.8
like 10 times to see whether I've got it

10276.97 --> 10280.599999999999
wrong and look for the angle that may

10278.8 --> 10282.22
I've got it wrong sometimes there is

10280.6 --> 10283.749
like a little slimmer of an angle that

10282.22 --> 10286.3
you could put you could potentially

10283.749 --> 10288.609
interpret it in a weird way and then

10286.3 --> 10290.438999999998
it's like obscure but or it is

10288.609 --> 10294.189
technically there but on this one it's

10290.439 --> 10297.459
just because in their mind we we have to

10294.189 --> 10302.109
be it because all of science says that

10297.459 --> 10305.079000000002
they are all right right hey there aside

10302.109 --> 10308.02
their body of science or at the same

10305.079 --> 10311.699
time tells them they're wrong and yeah

10308.02 --> 10311.699
the funny part they don't really notice

10312.3 --> 10319.749
they just try to use Mesmer to confuse

10315.67 --> 10322.42
you to drain you so you give up they say

10319.749 --> 10325.449
my thor they claim authority by method

10322.42 --> 10329.05
not by fact all right they claim

10325.449 --> 10330.52
authority by consensus that's why he

10329.05 --> 10338.579
cites the whole of a scientific

10330.52 --> 10342.689
community agrees half the time science

10338.579 --> 10342.689
community doesn't agree with each other

10347.2 --> 10351.939
right sure so guys I think I'm gonna

10350.26 --> 10356.16
round out the show we've been going for

10351.939 --> 10358.09
almost three hours it's been quite a bad

10356.16 --> 10363.16
but yeah yeah

10358.09 --> 10365.37
getting hungry I need some lunch so yeah

10363.16 --> 10370.72
thank you all for coming it's been

10365.37 --> 10373.960000000001
interesting panel so yeah chocolate

10370.72 --> 10376.688999999998
saying matrix media peanuts Clark Renta

10373.96 --> 10379.33
flat earth earlier sleeping water all of

10376.689 --> 10380.380000000001
you for coming on my panel and having

10379.33 --> 10382.33
this yeah

10380.38 --> 10388.8
who brought discussion about a lot of

10382.33 --> 10393.939
things from cars to health situations to

10388.8 --> 10397.15
Flat Earth facts add so many things it's

10393.939 --> 10398.92
been endless and lawyer details that was

10397.15 --> 10399.43
very interesting stuff thanks for that

10398.92 --> 10401.83
Riley

10399.43 --> 10404.229000000001
Harlan don't don't forget we talked

10401.83 --> 10408.1
about black holes doing

10404.229 --> 10411.31
yeah Brenda oh god I had literally

10408.1 --> 10414.31
forgotten that part but yeah Brenda I

10411.31 --> 10416.769999999999
had to kick her out because she's she

10414.31 --> 10419.8
came on your panel earlier yeah she at

10416.77 --> 10422.560000000001
the beginning pretty early like Randy

10419.8 --> 10425.679999999998
joined and then Brenda came in what's

10422.56 --> 10429.64
the duration of the Bangkok it's now at

10425.68 --> 10432.130000000001
two hours and 51 minutes Wow

10429.64 --> 10433.449999999999
yeah that's good I like this I like

10432.13 --> 10437.229
doing this in the weekends especially

10433.45 --> 10439.810000000001
because Nathan never does debates so I'm

10437.229 --> 10441.849999999999
just saying okay he yeah I got all the

10439.81 --> 10444.13
room people do kind of want to see your

10441.85 --> 10447.210000000001
debates now of course hojae's also

10444.13 --> 10451.96
running his hangouts the baller hangout

10447.21 --> 10455.38
but yeah I will provide this platform on

10451.96 --> 10457.39
in the weekends as yeah as an

10455.38 --> 10459.009999999998
opportunity to get longer hangouts with

10457.39 --> 10460.449999999999
open panels just throwing out the

10459.01 --> 10464.65
linkage chat and it seems to be working

10460.45 --> 10468.729000000001
great so far so yeah thank you all for

10464.65 --> 10471.76
coming and thank you Arlen and chocolate

10468.729 --> 10474.279999999999
I'll see you over at this Court yes sir

10471.76 --> 10476.689
all right hashtag meifa thank you over

10474.28 --> 10480.199
Mukul everybody

10476.689 --> 10487.550000000001
yeah so I'm gonna run out to show you

10480.199 --> 10491.54
shout out to George Moussa surface thank

10487.55 --> 10493.698999999999

alright so yeah I was great loved it

10511.25 --> 10517.22
thanks everyone in chat also for coming

10514.25 --> 10519.199
I haven't paid too much attention to the

10517.22 --> 10523.489
chat after the panelists starts dropping

10519.199 --> 10527.119
in so but yeah guys my very active is

10523.489 --> 10529.939
great thanks for everything you do and
