30.77 --> 38.07
[Music]

58.92 --> 61.92
take

76.72 --> 82.2
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

80.24 --> 85.64
bir number

82.2 --> 87.52000000000001
1915 I'm your host R win and before

patreon I got that in today I really

120.28 --> 126.479
appreciate that can really use

123.119 --> 129.039
it right so weather today

126.479 --> 132.4
is very similar to

129.039 --> 136.48
yesterday some really big clouds out

132.4 --> 137.76000000000002
there but also some blue sky and there's

136.48 --> 140.35999999999999
sun right

137.76 --> 143.79999999999998
now look at those trees down there

140.36 --> 147.519
they're like blossoming full

143.8 --> 147.519
power it's quite

148.319 --> 151.83999999999997
beautiful quite a beautiful

159.28 --> 162.639
[Music]

163.08 --> 166.08
site

172.72 --> 177.76
right so yeah caught a bit of Blue Sky

176.599 --> 180.48
clouds are

177.76 --> 182.12
rushing up there though so I don't know

180.48 --> 187.11999999999998
how long

182.12 --> 187.12
this sun is going to last over

189.59 --> 194.76
[Music]

191.76 --> 194.76
here

197.799 --> 206.36
right

199.799 --> 206.36
so it is Friday the 5th of April

208.76 --> 211.76
2024

218.68 --> 222.4
right let me change

238.72 --> 241.72
browsers

243.2 --> 248.439
let me check the

244.68 --> 253.87900000000002
[Music]

248.439 --> 253.879
weather 15° C oo

254.4 --> 259.88
73% precipitation H so there is a lot of

257.72 --> 260.959
rain going around those clouds do seem

259.88 --> 265.04
very

260.959 --> 265.04
thick 82%

265.479 --> 268.71999999999997
humidity seems like it's going to be a

267.52 --> 272.919
wet day

268.72 --> 277.96000000000004
what wow this is crazy

272.919 --> 280.039
this it predicts tomorrow to be

277.96 --> 282.32
24° on

280.039 --> 287.96
Saturday

282.32 --> 290.24
whoa 24 degrees and and sunny so looks

287.96 --> 294.32
like tomorrow might

290.24 --> 297.36
be a t-shirt day that's the first time

294.32 --> 302.32
it's gotten that hot if it'll actually

297.36 --> 302.32
get that hot 24° Bree what a

302.72 --> 305.72
jump

310.84 --> 315.75899999999996
huh

312.72 --> 321.88000000000005
right so

315.759 --> 324.52000000000004
yeah I did turn on my alarm clock at

321.88 --> 327.44
1:00 but then I thought like oh I need

324.52 --> 331.0
to just relax my back a

327.44 --> 332.919
little and then I woke up

331.0 --> 338.919
then I woke up

332.919 --> 338.919
again uh 5 minutes before 2 so it's very

339.4 --> 347.0
typical I have to keep trying this until

343.44 --> 349.36
I get it right hey John Bernard's first

347.0 --> 351.919
in chat good to see you it's been a

349.36 --> 356.12
while how you

351.919 --> 356.12
doing the spring is in

356.639 --> 361.639
indeed hello fiber good to see you

361.72 --> 364.759
yeah I was just looking

365.16 --> 372.96000000000004
around like one of the Dutch sites that

370.4 --> 377.35999999999996
I typically

372.96 --> 377.35999999999996
check they had a very interesting

378.12 --> 385.28000000000003
link and a story about redheaded Giants

383.16 --> 388.28000000000003
in

385.28 --> 392.28
America and they had a PDF so it's from

388.28 --> 392.28
the Nevada historical

398.88 --> 405.84
society and yeah this is a PDF that is

402.72 --> 408.40000000000003
about redheaded

405.84 --> 410.28
Giants thought that's interesting I

408.4 --> 411.919
haven't actually read through the whole

410.28 --> 414.84
thing yet but I'm pretty sure it's going

411.919 --> 418.52
to be interesting so I'm sharing that

414.84 --> 421.52
PDF link so you can check it out

418.52 --> 421.52
yourselves

427.44 --> 433.319
right so maybe this will connect up in

431.0 --> 433.319
some

433.919 --> 440.31899999999996
way with the eclipse event and

437.759 --> 443.0
the St Andrews

440.319 --> 445.68
cross that is being

443.0 --> 451.28
completed through the

445.68 --> 453.479
eclipse and the yeah the the alleged

451.28 --> 456.63899999999995
Celtic

453.479 --> 459.8
connection of which the redheaded Giants

456.639 --> 463.08
were a part like logically they seem

459.8 --> 464.639
like they should be or they are probably

463.08 --> 467.96
a part of

464.639 --> 470.52
that so that's interesting that

467.96 --> 474.08
that

470.52 --> 474.08
website brought that

478.44 --> 481.44
up

488.36 --> 493.639
right this discovery was in

491.08 --> 496.84
1911

493.639 --> 499.68
Giants 2 and A2 M

496.84 --> 504.4
tall they had

499.68 --> 504.40000000000003
like they were proportionately very

506.08 --> 512.36
big

508.12 --> 512.36
a what is it what did they

514.839 --> 522.32
say 40 cm long

519.32 --> 522.32
feet

528.36 --> 535.6
sandals and the local Indians

532.16 --> 539.56
there or the Indians in the South have

535.6 --> 541.519
stories about redheaded giant what they

539.56 --> 545.64
call

541.519 --> 548.6
barbarians 3,000 years

545.64 --> 552.079
ago being there

548.6 --> 555.0
and causing a

552.079 --> 558.04
ruckus very

555.0 --> 562.56
interesting now there might be Celtic

558.04 --> 563.64
connection or or just Giants I mean

562.56 --> 567.5999999999999
that's just

563.64 --> 567.6
interesting by itself isn't

568.36 --> 574.6800000000001
it so long live the internet information

571.959 --> 578.399
slipping through Smith sonian

574.68 --> 578.399
isn't removing

583.399 --> 588.959
this right so I'm happy to be able to

585.959 --> 588.959
share that with you

598.32 --> 601.32
guys

610.0 --> 615.12
right also hope that everybody took

612.04 --> 615.12
yesterday's show to

615.44 --> 624.12
Heart the especially the Don't Be Afraid

620.24 --> 626.88
part don't be afraid around the

624.12 --> 630.399
apocalypse

626.88 --> 632.6
and like don't be afraid of like oh

630.399 --> 635.2
there won't be any

632.6 --> 637.0
food especially if you're in the United

635.2 --> 639.0
States it seems very

637.0 --> 643.079
unlikely unless you're going to be

639.0 --> 643.079
completely dependent on the system for

643.68 --> 651.3599999999999
food but they're should be plenty of

646.92 --> 651.36
ground that food can be

658.24 --> 661.24
made

665.07 --> 668.269
[Music]

674.279 --> 679.279
right all right so hope you guys are

676.92 --> 679.279
doing

688.24 --> 691.24
good

712.68 --> 721.7199999999999
oh by the way the PDF is a part in a

716.76 --> 721.72
series so it starts at page each

722.519 --> 730.2
243 ends at 304 so

726.0 --> 730.2
it's roughly 60

730.639 --> 734.12
pages and not

748.16 --> 751.16
300

754.959 --> 759.5999999999999
right I'm definitely going to try to

756.92 --> 762.4799999999999
read through this thing but yeah not

759.6 --> 766.0790000000001
during the show that would

762.48 --> 770.6800000000001
be a long swwa of

766.079 --> 770.68
Silence you too can look through

771.56 --> 780.04
it the Giants were redheaded and

776.88 --> 782.92
Tall the setting is often

780.04 --> 782.92
Love Lock

788.199 --> 791.5999999999999
cave I guess

795.6 --> 799.8000000000001
so well that's what this one is

808.12 --> 811.12
about

838.04 --> 841.04
for

854.88 --> 860.399
right so yeah you almost wish that there

857.24 --> 863.88
were more places like

860.399 --> 866.44
that to to

863.88 --> 868.04
reference I wonder if there were any

866.44 --> 871.0400000000001
other places like

868.04 --> 871.04
that

871.519 --> 876.759
that stuff could be dug up with or maybe

874.519 --> 879.36
it was really that

876.759 --> 882.9590000000001
rare maybe there weren't that many

879.36 --> 882.9590000000001
Giants out there

883.6 --> 887.24
comparatively don't really

890.36 --> 894.8000000000001
know okay let's turn this noise

898.04 --> 901.04
off

902.16 --> 904.8389999999999
come on

908.959 --> 912.88
then are you being so

927.959 --> 932.68
noisy

929.959 --> 932.68
ah there we

933.0 --> 936.279
go all

940.44 --> 947.24
right so yeah I'm going to turn on my uh

944.399 --> 948.279
coffee and put my Illuminati croan in

947.24 --> 952.04
the

948.279 --> 952.04
oven I'll be right

957.92 --> 960.92
back

987.92 --> 990.92
for

1017.839 --> 1020.839
for

1047.84 --> 1050.84
right

1052.66 --> 1055.9
[Music]

1077.84 --> 1080.84
for

1107.76 --> 1111.32
right

1109.799 --> 1113.9189999999999
all right so I hope you guys are all

1111.32 --> 1113.9189999999999
enjoying

1114.96 --> 1119.28
spring have no idea what kind of weather

1117.44 --> 1122.679
it is out

1119.28 --> 1124.84
there G was talking about how he was

1122.679 --> 1127.48
basically packing the snow still

1124.84 --> 1127.48
yesterday

1137.72 --> 1140.72
so

1149.559 --> 1153.6399999999999
at this point I don't really know what

1151.12 --> 1153.6399999999999
to talk

1167.72 --> 1170.72
about

1195.64 --> 1200.64
[Music]

1197.64 --> 1200.64
h

1202.919 --> 1209.7990000000002
H there's some talk on the

1206.4 --> 1209.799
television about

1211.84 --> 1214.84
tribunals

1215.36 --> 1221.32
concerning the

1218.12 --> 1223.28
pandemic but also Ukraine and the

1221.32 --> 1227.6399999999999
climate

1223.28 --> 1230.6399999999999
agenda so that's

1227.64 --> 1230.64
encouraging

1232.679 --> 1237.0
and there's a lot of that going around

1239.6 --> 1246.76
recently what's the best Fe

1242.96 --> 1249.679
argument well the best for what you know

1246.76 --> 1252.08
the best against the

1249.679 --> 1256.5590000000002
globe well that would be the second law

1252.08 --> 1258.9189999999999
of Thermodynamics definitely the law of

1256.559 --> 1261.1589999999999
nature that you can't have again gas

1258.919 --> 1264.679
pressure without

1261.159 --> 1268.4
containment and in the

1264.679 --> 1271.76
model heliocentric outer space there is

1268.4 --> 1276.1200000000001
no containment except for a suggestion

1271.76 --> 1278.679
of gravity as a force which even as if

1276.12 --> 1282.279
you think of it as a force wouldn't be

1278.679 --> 1284.6000000000001
capable of containment in any sort in

1282.279 --> 1285.6
any way there's no description of how

1284.6 --> 1289.9189999999999
that would

1285.6 --> 1292.279
work other than by rearranging our very

1289.919 --> 1296.8400000000001
understanding of how matter

1292.279 --> 1300.12
behaves in which gas would be falsely

1296.84 --> 1301.84
reduced to a fluid basically a liquid in

1300.12 --> 1305.08
order for that to be

1301.84 --> 1306.6399999999999
accomplished so only through th th

1305.08 --> 1310.279
through

1306.64 --> 1312.1200000000001
fraud could gravity be suggested even if

1310.279 --> 1315.36
you think of it as a force which

1312.12 --> 1317.52
officially it isn't that it could bypass

1315.36 --> 1319.9599999999998
the second law of

1317.52 --> 1322.44
thermodynamics

1319.96 --> 1326.559
and just the the revealing of that

1322.44 --> 1329.039
cluster screw of a situation like it is

1326.559 --> 1332.52
definitely the best argument Second Law

1329.039 --> 1335.2
thermodynamics gas pressure requires

1332.52 --> 1338.799
containment and the outer space model of

1335.2 --> 1338.799
ball Earth doesn't have

1342.35 --> 1345.54
[Music]

1347.52 --> 1350.52
it

1350.96 --> 1357.08
and the argument is quite well known as

1353.52 --> 1359.6
well by now it's it's a well-known

1357.08 --> 1361.72
argument like everywhere I do go there

1359.6 --> 1364.52
are flat earthers

1361.72 --> 1366.52
around like even at Infowars there's

1364.52 --> 1369.279
flat earthers around hang around in the

1366.52 --> 1369.279
chats and all

1370.32 --> 1373.76
that and some

1377.44 --> 1380.44
Boomers

1398.64 --> 1401.64
so yeah John Bernard hope that answers

1400.679 --> 1403.679
the

1401.64 --> 1406.7990000000002
question

1403.679 --> 1409.5590000000002
yeah gas pressure requiring containment

1406.799 --> 1412.32
is definitely the most

1409.559 --> 1414.48
reliable solid

1412.32 --> 1417.72
argument against the ball Earth

1414.48 --> 1420.72
cosmology and for a flat Earth model

1417.72 --> 1420.72
whatever it is

1430.72 --> 1437.44
like of course the

1433.039 --> 1440.36
overall issues with the Flat Earth is

1437.44 --> 1442.8400000000001
that

1440.36 --> 1446.52
it reveals that there are so many

1442.84 --> 1449.279
mysteries about the Earth about the

1446.52 --> 1453.799
situations on Earth about the

1449.279 --> 1455.76
phenomena that are here it just reveals

1453.799 --> 1459.96
that there is a whole bunch of things

1455.76 --> 1459.96
that we technically don't

1460.2 --> 1465.679
understand that the ball Earth Believers

1463.6 --> 1470.36
love to claim that they have all the

1465.679 --> 1470.3600000000001
answers to it when obviously they don't

1470.559 --> 1473.9189999999999
they got a lot of made of hor

1474.84 --> 1480.279
[ __ ] like about

1477.2 --> 1482.559
the the magnetic field the Earthly

1480.279 --> 1484.76
magnetic field the way that works is

1482.559 --> 1489.6399999999999
really

1484.76 --> 1493.36
weird doesn't really relate to how we

1489.64 --> 1493.3600000000001
know magnetics

1494.48 --> 1500.44
works like with actual physical magnets

1497.64 --> 1503.64
and magnetic fields that come off them

1500.44 --> 1505.559
so the Earth's magnetic field is kind of

1503.64 --> 1509.5590000000002
weird now of

1505.559 --> 1511.6789999999999
course the celestial lights are a

1509.559 --> 1514.6789999999999
gigantic

1511.679 --> 1514.679
mystery

1515.36 --> 1523.9599999999998
gigantic which leaves a lot of questions

1519.919 --> 1523.96
right uh what else you

1527.039 --> 1533.32
got yeah that we don't have full

1530.44 --> 1535.64
knowledge over the complete dimensions

1533.32 --> 1535.6399999999999
of the

1539.159 --> 1545.1200000000001
container sexon

1542.159 --> 1546.88
navigation yeah well sex and

1545.12 --> 1549.84
navigation

1546.88 --> 1552.5200000000002
proves that the Earth is flat that

1549.84 --> 1555.32
you're navigating a flat

1552.52 --> 1557.24
Earth through the way that that process

1555.32 --> 1559.2
works

1557.24 --> 1562.0
definitely

1559.2 --> 1565.3600000000001
but you know how it goes the ballards do

1562.0 --> 1567.799
find ways to make an

1565.36 --> 1568.76
excuse on how you can still do it on a

1567.799 --> 1572.24
ball

1568.76 --> 1576.48
by using an arbitrary line in the middle

1572.24 --> 1576.48
of the sky that would be used as a

1578.679 --> 1583.24
horizon hey twit wit good see

1587.24 --> 1590.24
you

1593.44 --> 1599.2
right but technically yeah sex

1595.84 --> 1602.1999999999998
navigation is historically very

1599.2 --> 1604.039
important right that that part

1602.2 --> 1610.039
especially

1604.039 --> 1613.919
that sexon navigation is historically

1610.039 --> 1615.72
important to basically prove that a lot

1613.919 --> 1620.24
of these stories about how the Earth was

1615.72 --> 1620.24
a globe and then then we did

1620.84 --> 1626.36
navigation with the globe in mind is

1623.6 --> 1626.36
complete

1635.76 --> 1641.44
nonsense

1637.32 --> 1642.559
measure entropy production on a nan

1641.44 --> 1646.24
scale

1642.559 --> 1647.1589999999999
what no I didn't know that twit wit but

1646.24 --> 1648.88
I'm not

1647.159 --> 1650.2
surprised

1648.88 --> 1654.6000000000001
I mean they need

1650.2 --> 1657.799
to break all the laws break the laws of

1654.6 --> 1661.1589999999999
nature yeah if you want to make a

1657.799 --> 1663.48
nonsense reality you need to break all

1661.159 --> 1666.48
basic understanding all laws of nature

1663.48 --> 1669.519
everything that is reliable and

1666.48 --> 1673.279
repeatable it all needs to be

1669.519 --> 1676.919
replaced with more complicated nonsense

1673.279 --> 1678.96
that makes everything more convoluted

1676.919 --> 1681.279
harder to figure out

1678.96 --> 1681.279
and

1701.64 --> 1706.8400000000001
unusable but yeah I have not heard about

1705.08 --> 1709.76
any details of

1706.84 --> 1713.24
this except exactly do you

1709.76 --> 1717.799
mean measuring entropy production on a

1713.24 --> 1717.799
Nanos scale what what does that mean

1719.799 --> 1726.48
specifically what's entropy

1723.24 --> 1727.84
production I mean entropy is just it

1726.48 --> 1731.96
just

1727.84 --> 1731.9599999999998
happens I didn't know it was a

1735.63 --> 1740.0390000000002
[Music]

1737.039 --> 1740.039
product

1740.81 --> 1744.01
[Music]

1760.2 --> 1764.72
going Beyond forcing puzzle pieces to

1762.559 --> 1767.039
fit now they're just creating pieces out

1764.72 --> 1768.64
of thin air

1767.039 --> 1772.12
yeah

1768.64 --> 1772.1200000000001
and it's completely pointless

1773.76 --> 1778.6
too I mean if they really want a

1776.279 --> 1781.279
solution to how the Earth is a bow and

1778.6 --> 1783.8799999999999
the gas sticks to it there's other ways

1781.279 --> 1783.88
of doing

1788.48 --> 1795.3600000000001
that I just just continue with the

1791.64 --> 1797.5590000000002
gravity stuff just I mean there's all

1795.36 --> 1800.6399999999999
these ideas of gravity and they keep

1797.559 --> 1804.6
holding on on to this stupid Einstein

1800.64 --> 1806.8400000000001
crap and it is Einstein crap it's just a

1804.6 --> 1808.36
bunch of mathematical crap it's really

1806.84 --> 1811.9189999999999
not that all that

1808.36 --> 1811.9189999999999
useful it really

1813.799 --> 1817.32
isn't they should

1817.48 --> 1823.48
just go beyond and figure out like they

1821.32 --> 1823.48
have

1824.279 --> 1832.12
toate with the Newtonian gravity and

1829.399 --> 1832.12
redefine

1833.679 --> 1839.039
it I mean it's way more feasible than

1836.72 --> 1842.72
Einstein gravity which is Einstein

1839.039 --> 1846.44
gravity is just a disaster at every

1842.72 --> 1849.84
corner when you put it to practice like

1846.44 --> 1852.44
it's a disaster it's a creative disaster

1849.84 --> 1852.4399999999998
Einstein

1853.44 --> 1859.039
gravity and that's why most people it

1856.559 --> 1862.2
already on a voluntary basis just stick

1859.039 --> 1863.96
to Newtonian gravity understanding and

1862.2 --> 1866.3990000000001
then just say like oh but they're

1863.96 --> 1869.44
they're the same

1866.399 --> 1873.08
somehow like yeah or Einstein gravity is

1869.44 --> 1876.919
just complete crap just total [ __ ]

1873.08 --> 1880.639
crap needs to be in the bin

1876.919 --> 1883.3600000000001
burned burn it it's all crap everything

1880.639 --> 1883.36
about it is

1886.919 --> 1889.919
crap

1892.159 --> 1897.7990000000002
like there's literally nothing useful

1894.919 --> 1899.96
about Einstein gravity nothing nothing

1897.799 --> 1899.96
at

1900.399 --> 1908.5189999999998
all like the remotest hint of usefulness

1904.84 --> 1910.4399999999998
about it is that it gave some kind of

1908.519 --> 1914.32
form

1910.44 --> 1917.44
of conceptualizing a black hole and

1914.32 --> 1922.2
that's it that's the only thing it sort

1917.44 --> 1925.6390000000001
of does uniquely that's the only [ __ ]

1922.2 --> 1929.559
thing it does uniquely the rest it's

1925.639 --> 1932.4399999999998
just dead ends at every corner it's

1929.559 --> 1935.96
terrible it gives you a three body

1932.44 --> 1939.0
problem it makes everything completely

1935.96 --> 1942.6000000000001
useless like it doesn't do anything it

1939.0 --> 1945.88
it it wanders outside of physical

1942.6 --> 1948.6
reality into a conceptual reality that

1945.88 --> 1950.48
cannot be proven it's just the

1948.6 --> 1953.6
disaster it's

1950.48 --> 1956.08
insane that it's been held on this long

1953.6 --> 1956.08
totally

1956.559 --> 1963.36
insane right so just reinvent Newtonian

1959.88 --> 1966.44
mechanics reinvent Newtonian gravity and

1963.36 --> 1972.639
go with what I came up with as bwin

1966.44 --> 1972.6390000000001
years ago now carefully hinted it out

1973.279 --> 1982.2
like treat gravity like it's a weird

1979.08 --> 1982.1999999999998
type of magnetic

1982.32 --> 1988.6
phenomenon so that there should be the

1985.48 --> 1991.2
force of gravity but

1988.6 --> 1994.639
fluctuations within the force over

1991.2 --> 1997.0800000000002
distance and not just linear decrease

1994.639 --> 1997.08
over

1997.32 --> 2004.84
distance yeah you have to break it up

2000.559 --> 2004.84
you have to break up the

2005.12 --> 2013.639
linearity within Newtonian gravity

2009.039 --> 2015.76
and then you can attempt to try to fix

2013.639 --> 2019.1999999999998
second law of Thermodynamics problem

2015.76 --> 2020.559
with it nobody pays attention though

2019.2 --> 2024.04
nobody

2020.559 --> 2027.1299999999999
cares and bowan has to die

2024.04 --> 2027.1299999999999
[Music]

2030.24 --> 2033.24
so

2033.919 --> 2042.8400000000001
yeah gravity Shield Newtonian gravity

2038.639 --> 2045.7199999999998
Shield naturally forming I mean don't

2042.84 --> 2049.359
you want all the planetary bodies out

2045.72 --> 2051.7200000000003
there to have gas containment of some

2049.359 --> 2054.04
kind isn't that just like

2051.72 --> 2057.1589999999997
critical for the entire

2054.04 --> 2061.599
conceptualization of existence and

2057.159 --> 2066.04
the and the potential for other places

2061.599 --> 2066.04
being viable in any kind of

2066.72 --> 2074.1589999999997
way gravity Shield not all gravity

2070.76 --> 2078.3990000000003
contains it just the way it is no

2074.159 --> 2081.52
Shield a a barrier you need that

2078.399 --> 2085.5989999999997
barrier you need that barrier to exist

2081.52 --> 2088.119
naturally so that places Planet

2085.599 --> 2093.119
supposedly out

2088.119 --> 2095.2000000000003
there will have this buffer zone in

2093.119 --> 2099.6400000000003
which gases will be contained to a

2095.2 --> 2102.3999999999996
degree depending on the total

2099.64 --> 2104.52
preponderance of gravity so if there's a

2102.4 --> 2107.44
lot of gravity because there's a lot of

2104.52 --> 2109.7599999999998
mass like on Jupiter for example or

2107.44 --> 2112.48
Saturn well then there should also be

2109.76 --> 2112.48
more gas

2123.72 --> 2129.56
containment this is so funny actually

2126.24 --> 2133.0
talking about this is like

2129.56 --> 2134.7999999999997
turning down my tentis maybe bwin was

2133.0 --> 2138.079
just giving me a headache because it's

2134.8 --> 2140.8
like are you giving up on the ball how

2138.079 --> 2143.52
dare you Arwin I don't know what's going

2140.8 --> 2146.0
on anyway hello debatable D and hello

2143.52 --> 2146.0
Richard

2148.319 --> 2155.44
G is it new toon mechanics that they

2151.28 --> 2155.44
call classical mechanics

2156.64 --> 2159.64
yes

2162.96 --> 2167.56
yes twit and it is a thing scientists

2166.44 --> 2171.28
refus

2167.56 --> 2174.96
to admit that they were wrong when the

2171.28 --> 2174.96
whole point about

2175.079 --> 2180.6400000000003
science the religion is that you keep

2178.28 --> 2182.8390000000004
building that you keep figuring it out

2180.64 --> 2185.44
and every time somebody figures out how

2182.839 --> 2188.119
it really works then they get all praise

2185.44 --> 2190.8
and it's like wow we figured it out

2188.119 --> 2193.6400000000003
yeah so why the hell are all you

2190.8 --> 2196.52
[ __ ] out there holding on to

2193.64 --> 2199.72
outdated crap that isn't

2196.52 --> 2202.079
working you

2199.72 --> 2206.68
idiots you

2202.079 --> 2208.48
suck your religion sucks you're idiots

2206.68 --> 2211.68
with your own religion you don't even

2208.48 --> 2213.68
know how to maintain your own

2211.68 --> 2216.7599999999998
religion an

2213.68 --> 2218.9199999999996
outsider that is a fervent flat earther

2216.76 --> 2220.8390000000004
needs to figure f it out for you how

2218.92 --> 2223.44
[ __ ] pathetic is

2220.839 --> 2225.599
that anyway I'm going to get my coffee

2223.44 --> 2228.7200000000003
and Illuminati CS sounds like it's going

2225.599 --> 2228.7200000000003
to be an interesting show

2246.52 --> 2249.52
today

2276.44 --> 2279.44
e

2302.53 --> 2305.7090000000003
[Music]

2306.44 --> 2309.44
ah

2316.04 --> 2319.04
what

2319.16 --> 2325.64
Cate okay zombie what you mean zombie

2327.17 --> 2330.539
[Music]

2334.599 --> 2339.44
Cate what's wrong with the case it just

2339.76 --> 2347.4
Beatles that eat grass and create

2344.04 --> 2347.4
foam they're

2348.2 --> 2354.52
cute why is it zombie what are they

2351.0 --> 2354.52
going to do just eat a bunch of

2355.96 --> 2361.7200000000003
plants I mean if there's massive Cades

2359.56 --> 2364.48
out there that's like going to be a

2361.72 --> 2364.48
feast for the

2366.359 --> 2369.359
birds

2376.44 --> 2381.2400000000002
the noise is going to drive you to crazy

2381.92 --> 2386.6800000000003
why what they make noise like crickets

2384.52 --> 2386.68
or

2395.56 --> 2399.92
something it would be kind of hilarious

2398.16 --> 2401.0789999999997
if there was like a giant Cricket

2399.92 --> 2404.319
Invasion

2401.079 --> 2407.48
everywhere it's like oh [ __ ] oh yeah we

2404.319 --> 2408.88
had some uh Bill Gates has secretly made

2407.48 --> 2411.8
a couple of

2408.88 --> 2414.6800000000003
Laboratories with crickets to like

2411.8 --> 2417.3590000000004
replace the food in anticipation of that

2414.68 --> 2421.56
and then like an accident happened and

2417.359 --> 2424.24
like the electric security somehow got

2421.56 --> 2427.319
hacked and went down and like they all

2424.24 --> 2429.72
escaped so there's like a 100 million

2427.319 --> 2431.7599999999998
crickets that stly go walking out of the

2429.72 --> 2435.64
Laboratories

2431.76 --> 2435.6400000000003
everywhere that would be kind of

2437.64 --> 2443.839
weird constant noise for

2440.599 --> 2443.839
months oh

2447.96 --> 2453.48
goody mating

2450.64 --> 2456.2
Noise Okay well if it's mating noise

2453.48 --> 2459.2400000000002
it's not going to last forever at least

2456.2 --> 2459.24
I mean it's just like

2463.55 --> 2470.1600000000003
[Music]

2466.56 --> 2470.16
hopping out of the lab yeah yeah

2480.49 --> 2483.72
[Music]

2486.24 --> 2491.72
yeah

2488.96 --> 2495.28
well if it hasn't happened in 100 years

2491.72 --> 2500.64
that means that it happened in 100 years

2495.28 --> 2500.6400000000003
ago so yeah it's called natural

2500.92 --> 2506.0
Hazard United States especially has a

2503.68 --> 2506.0
lot of

2507.52 --> 2513.48
them some of them are like a yearly

2510.52 --> 2516.24
event so yeah that's that's what you got

2513.48 --> 2519.2400000000002
to learn to live with it's the United

2516.24 --> 2519.24
States

2520.48 --> 2524.119
try recording the sound

2530.319 --> 2535.599
okay Cycles within a Clos dynamic system

2544.92 --> 2550.8
indeed jeez

2548.079 --> 2552.079
man these clouds are really rushing by

2550.8 --> 2555.319
very

2552.079 --> 2559.92
fast look at how blue it's almost like

2555.319 --> 2559.92
purple blue in between that looks

2562.319 --> 2569.04
amazing look I'm holding it still you

2566.0 --> 2571.48
can literally see them

2569.04 --> 2573.4
move that's how fast the clouds are

2571.48 --> 2575.319
going and with the eye you can see it

2573.4 --> 2579.04
much better because you can see

2575.319 --> 2581.2

2688.68 --> 2694.1189999999997
survive if that keeps happening then

2691.119 --> 2694.119
they're going to be wiped

up

2895.17 --> 2898.219
[Music]

2899.96 --> 2905.76
did anybody by the way check out the

2902.24 --> 2908.7599999999998
movie Spaceman yet from Adam

2905.76 --> 2908.76
Sandler

2915.96 --> 2920.7200000000003
I've engaged in

2919.2 --> 2922.5989999999997
watching

2920.72 --> 2926.319
um The

2922.599 --> 2930.559
Martian again on Netflix which is a very

2926.319 --> 2932.88
good interesting movie it's a very

2930.559 --> 2935.7200000000003
enjoyable movie in many

2932.88 --> 2940.359
ways watching it

2935.72 --> 2942.5989999999997
again it was a bit odd yeah I told you

2940.359 --> 2945.7599999999998
it was really

2942.599 --> 2949.119
psychological and you never really

2945.76 --> 2952.28
know you enjoyed the book you you read

2949.119 --> 2954.48
the book of that

2952.28 --> 2957.1600000000003
huh didn't know there was a book of

2954.48 --> 2957.16
course there's a

2958.44 --> 2964.16
book oh the

2960.359 --> 2969.5589999999997
Martian right yeah I haven't read

2964.16 --> 2972.0
that but uh yeah space ban is a very odd

2969.559 --> 2974.3190000000004
movie but it's really interesting and

2972.0 --> 2977.28
it's very psychological and

2974.319 --> 2979.0
it's in a way it just feels again like

2977.28 --> 2983.559
one of those movies that's just telling

2979.0 --> 2988.0
you like heyy you space nerds right you

2983.559 --> 2988.0
need to actually know what's really

2988.72 --> 2995.64
important and yeah the movie really did

2992.68 --> 2997.9199999999996
that again in a very successful way and

2995.64 --> 3001.5589999999997
it's

2997.92 --> 3003.76
it's also fascinating to realize like

3001.559 --> 3008.4
you never really find

3003.76 --> 3008.4
out you never really find out

3012.079 --> 3018.44
whether whether the

3014.76 --> 3021.599
spider was real or a hallucination

3018.44 --> 3025.64
like you just don't get the opportunity

3021.599 --> 3029.44
to be certain about it and like the main

3025.64 --> 3033.48
character just it doesn't matter

3029.44 --> 3033.48
eventually it's it's really weirdly

3035.04 --> 3039.839
done you thought there might be a little

3037.28 --> 3042.92
comic relief no no it's a it's a pretty

3039.839 --> 3042.92
serious drama

3051.96 --> 3057.359
really yeah the Martian has more comic

3055.359 --> 3060.48
relief in it

3057.359 --> 3062.92
have night have really fun nerd humor

3060.48 --> 3062.92
which is

3064.319 --> 3071.88
great oh okay twit wit see you later

3068.839 --> 3071.88

[Music]

3134.44 --> 3142.559
what better fake syy than NASA

3138.48 --> 3142.559
yeah no it was

3145.52 --> 3148.52
brilliant

3149.599 --> 3155.2400000000002
they

3151.16 --> 3155.24
like the way they handled

3155.799 --> 3161.559
it in Spaceman was basically the same

3160.0 --> 3164.559
kind of approach as they did with

3161.559 --> 3165.48
firefly where they like they really made

3164.559 --> 3168.0400000000004
that

3165.48 --> 3170.64
environment and they really worked with

3168.04 --> 3173.079
that environment like with the Firefly

3170.64 --> 3175.44
series they just had that spaceship

3173.079 --> 3177.2000000000003
built from the

3175.44 --> 3179.92
inside

3177.2 --> 3181.72
and it's like it's the environment and

3179.92 --> 3184.92
everything that happens happens in that

3181.72 --> 3187.9199999999996
environment and it's like it was really

3184.92 --> 3189.92
designed and they did that with this

3187.92 --> 3192.799
spaceship that Adam Sandler was in as

3189.92 --> 3195.04
well and it did it really well

3192.799 --> 3201.079
brilliantly

3195.04 --> 3204.119
done and also wasn't all Super Hyper

3201.079 --> 3207.559
techy it was kind of like on the level

3204.119 --> 3209.799
of what you'd be expecting to be there

3207.559 --> 3209.799
right

3216.88 --> 3223.44
now and that made it like more real in a

3220.04 --> 3223.44
way it was very well

3229.62 --> 3232.8199999999997
[Music]

3235.44 --> 3238.44
done

3248.88 --> 3251.88
oops

3265.359 --> 3268.359
h

3273.92 --> 3279.16
but yeah woodwork G bear the issue

3276.0 --> 3280.28
always with NASA is that if you want a

3279.16 --> 3283.24
fake

3280.28 --> 3286.2400000000002
Zerg the issue is when you have to do it

3283.24 --> 3286.24
live that's the

3295.319 --> 3298.319
problem

3299.64 --> 3305.72
right well if you don't have to do it

3302.28 --> 3309.88
live you can just edit out stuff

3305.72 --> 3309.8799999999997
afterward and perfect it very

3313.44 --> 3317.799
easily not a big fan of Sandler

3319.559 --> 3325.0
movies why why would that be tactical

3322.079 --> 3325.0
soap friend

3325.16 --> 3328.8799999999997
hello just just for the

3330.52 --> 3336.16
record he's being a Jew here too I mean

3333.92 --> 3340.92
not openly he's not even talking about

3336.16 --> 3340.92
that but I mean just look at his

3351.359 --> 3356.5589999999997
wife most of his movies are kind of

3354.119 --> 3359.92
childish yeah but they're childish in a

3356.559 --> 3364.3190000000004
good way they're

3359.92 --> 3364.319
amicable like people are

3369.079 --> 3374.039

3514.96 --> 3522.92
right brilliant

3517.799 --> 3526.88
article scientists find Ocean 700 kilm

3522.92 --> 3532.92
beneath the surface really how did they

3526.88 --> 3532.92
find those oceans 700 km be beneath the

3535.039 --> 3538.039
surface

3542.079 --> 3547.88
just like oh yeah we just go down this

3544.4 --> 3553.48
700 km hole and we just found an ocean

3547.88 --> 3553.48
uh no no they can't actually get that

3555.599 --> 3560.319
deep so let me

3560.559 --> 3566.88
rephrase scientist make

3563.48 --> 3569.68
up another alternative story about

3566.88 --> 3572.6400000000003
what's supposedly 700 km beneath the

3569.68 --> 3575.68
Earth surface yeah that would be a

3572.64 --> 3575.68
better way to phrase

3587.08 --> 3590.2599999999998
[Music]

3592.799 --> 3599.92
it oh yes of course it's all there

3598.0 --> 3603.68
yeah and I'm sure there's dinosaurs

3599.92 --> 3607.76
there too I'm sure they found nessie's

3603.68 --> 3612.359
grandparents there I'm sure they did and

3607.76 --> 3612.3590000000004
the levithan also lives there I'm no

3614.599 --> 3622.559
doubt and the ancestors of the squid

3619.2 --> 3622.5589999999997
people all of

3624.96 --> 3627.96
it

3628.0 --> 3632.76
I mean if we were to believe the uh

3630.119 --> 3633.88
biblical cosmology then there would be

3632.76 --> 3637.0
the

3633.88 --> 3640.2000000000003
Deep the realm would be in the deep and

3637.0 --> 3643.119
the Deep would be potentially an endless

3640.2 --> 3644.72
ocean so vast that we wouldn't be able

3643.119 --> 3647.52
to measure it and there would be

3644.72 --> 3651.0389999999998
gigantic creatures

3647.52 --> 3654.92
there including the Leviathan and the

3651.039 --> 3656.92
Leviathan how big would that

3654.92 --> 3660.079
be

3656.92 --> 3662.44
it would be an O Oceanic monster as big

3660.079 --> 3664.76
as an entire

3662.44 --> 3667.16
country like as big as the Netherlands

3664.76 --> 3669.88
or something so who knows what the hell

3667.16 --> 3673.8799999999997
is down there it's certainly

3669.88 --> 3675.44
not inside of ball Earth if you know

3673.88 --> 3679.44
what I

3675.44 --> 3683.039
mean and nobody measured

3679.44 --> 3685.48
it yeah it's just oo scientists are

3683.039 --> 3687.92
making up a new horeshit story without

3685.48 --> 3687.92
any

3688.839 --> 3694.119
backing that's

3691.119 --> 3697.079
cool maybe they could start working on

3694.119 --> 3699.6800000000003
how gravity is supposedly keeping the

3697.079 --> 3702.96
gas stuck to a ball versus an endless

3699.68 --> 3706.8799999999997
vacuum of outer space that might be a

3702.96 --> 3706.88
little bit more urgent to work

e what the hell is Northwestern

3838.079 --> 3842.76
University anyway the northwest of

3849.799 --> 3856.24
what and what is their significance

3853.96 --> 3859.4
evidence to their

3856.24 --> 3863.4799999999996
claim supporting that the water

3859.4 --> 3863.48
originated internally I mean there

3864.44 --> 3871.2400000000002
is are arguments to be made for that but

3867.64 --> 3871.24
certainly not within a ball

3881.799 --> 3887.4
cosmology but there are like huge pure

3886.24 --> 3891.0
water

3887.4 --> 3893.92
reservoirs that are like inside of the

3891.0 --> 3896.72
Earth

3893.92 --> 3900.48
right Gaddafi

3896.72 --> 3903.3999999999996
helped like dig into them and he wanted

3900.48 --> 3907.039
to use those reservoirs as a

3903.4 --> 3907.039
freshwater supply

3907.2 --> 3914.0389999999998
for uh damn

3911.359 --> 3916.7799999999997
it for that entire

3914.039 --> 3923.26
country yeah how can I forget

3916.78 --> 3923.26
[Music]

3924.64 --> 3928.44
that

3926.16 --> 3931.44
IIA that was

3928.44 --> 3931.44
it

3938.0 --> 3944.96
yeah so there are internal water

3942.64 --> 3947.0789999999997
reservoirs that are there that are like

3944.96 --> 3950.599
super pure

3947.079 --> 3950.599
water they do

3950.88 --> 3956.92
exist and it's interesting that they're

3953.64 --> 3960.319
so pure

3956.92 --> 3963.599
so yeah there may be pockets of

3960.319 --> 3966.52
water as there are pockets of minerals

3963.599 --> 3970.119
pockets of gold pockets of uranium

3966.52 --> 3972.92
pockets of crystals all kinds of

3970.119 --> 3976.599
pockets the further down you

3972.92 --> 3978.839
go like you could argue that within

3976.599 --> 3982.559
God's design of the

3978.839 --> 3984.5589999999997
realm the Earth itself may even be like

3982.559 --> 3990.0
a growing

3984.559 --> 3993.079
skin like a super huge skin layer of

3990.0 --> 3997.559
mineral and stuff that

3993.079 --> 4001.6400000000003
just that keeps growing or like DEC

3997.559 --> 4005.2000000000003
compounds as the pressure lowers

4001.64 --> 4007.5989999999997
above things crystallize that were just

4005.2 --> 4009.48
so compacted at the bottom at first that

4007.599 --> 4012.039
it's just

4009.48 --> 4014.64
like you can't get

4012.039 --> 4016.48
there and then as it arises to the

4014.64 --> 4019.0
surface it

4016.48 --> 4022.64
depressurizes

4019.0 --> 4026.68
crystallizes into what it

4022.64 --> 4030.64
is right the hydrogen mud at the end of

4026.68 --> 4030.64
the super deep Cola Bor

4030.799 --> 4035.7599999999998
hole may have like become a part of a

4034.799 --> 4038.0389999999998
water

4035.76 --> 4041.039
reservoir if normally

4038.039 --> 4043.4
depressurized right so that's how I

4041.039 --> 4043.4
think of

4044.039 --> 4050.3190000000004
it like a of yeah like a skin that could

4048.48 --> 4052.2
be

4050.319 --> 4056.0389999999998
growing and

4052.2 --> 4059.9199999999996
then as it gets depressurized it just

4056.039 --> 4065.48
becomes water it becomes Crystal Caves

4059.92 --> 4065.48
it becomes all these things all these

4071.17 --> 4076.2400000000002
[Music]

4072.96 --> 4078.799
resources immediate dismissal I don't

4076.24 --> 4078.799
know what that

4083.48 --> 4089.44
means I

4085.599 --> 4093.2400000000002
mean a claim without actual

4089.44 --> 4097.68
evidence can be immediately be

4093.24 --> 4097.679999999999
dismissed that is scientific

4101.12 --> 4106.0
standard if they can't even argue how

4104.52 --> 4110.319
they came

4106.0 --> 4112.719
to the supposed indication to the

4110.319 --> 4115.080000000001
evidence then why would you take

4112.719 --> 4118.159
anything they say series it's just a

4115.08 --> 4120.12
conception a conception based on what on

4118.159 --> 4123.759
evidence what is the

4120.12 --> 4127.799
evidence does the evidence actually

4123.759 --> 4130.799
back back the claim at

4127.799 --> 4130.799
all

4132.6 --> 4138.6
how I mean how I just explained it is

4135.719 --> 4140.08
just a concept like think of the Earth

4138.6 --> 4143.2390000000005
as a

4140.08 --> 4146.5199999999995
skin like we got a realm containment a

4143.239 --> 4149.08
limited volume potentially looping it is

4146.52 --> 4152.4400000000005
like a skin and in the

4149.08 --> 4156.199
skin skin

4152.44 --> 4158.599999999999
Grows Right it grows it

4156.199 --> 4161.678999999999
gets resources

4158.6 --> 4164.359
supplied through the blood through what

4161.679 --> 4167.359
is beneath the

4164.359 --> 4167.359
skin

4168.4 --> 4174.48
and so the Earth May literally be like

4171.239 --> 4177.48
the skin of the Titan I mean I'm not the

4174.48 --> 4179.5599999999995
first one to like anthropomorph the

4177.48 --> 4181.799
Earth itself as being potentially a

4179.56 --> 4184.400000000001
living being like all the oil is

4181.799 --> 4186.2789999999995
actually the blood vessels or whatever

4184.4 --> 4189.44
I'm not the first to do

4186.279 --> 4193.719
this but if you think about just all the

4189.44 --> 4196.28
minerals and all the precious metals and

4193.719 --> 4198.0
water reservoirs

4196.28 --> 4201.5199999999995
that seem to pop

4198.0 --> 4205.04
up at Great depths then you have to

4201.52 --> 4208.360000000001
think like is it a growing process and

4205.04 --> 4212.28
it's just the more it grows new pockets

4208.36 --> 4215.0
of pure resources just pop

4212.28 --> 4217.159
up and that the more we keep digging

4215.0 --> 4219.76
down the more we just bump into these

4217.159 --> 4222.96
things well maybe it's because they're

4219.76 --> 4222.96
growing into

4224.32 --> 4230.199
it right this is just a conception it's

4227.56 --> 4230.1990000000005
it's only a

4233.56 --> 4239.719
model how is it growing how is it

4236.56 --> 4241.120000000001
forming what is it forming out of is it

4239.719 --> 4245.159
is this

4241.12 --> 4247.5599999999995
skin like a transmutation process is it

4245.159 --> 4250.799999999999
literally material forming out of

4247.56 --> 4250.8
nothing how does it

4251.08 --> 4259.159
form is it water from the gr deep

4256.28 --> 4259.159
that is being

4260.0 --> 4263.0
transmutated

4263.679 --> 4272.52
into yeah into nonwater materials that

4267.52 --> 4273.92
is like coagulating and becoming part of

4272.52 --> 4276.92
the

4273.92 --> 4276.92
terrestrial

4278.159 --> 4281.92
mesh how does it all

4284.239 --> 4287.239
work

4291.32 --> 4296.04
the Earth may not be

4293.04 --> 4296.04
Hollow

4298.76 --> 4306.84
okay well Hollow Earth is only

4302.56 --> 4309.400000000001
really a globe expansion idea that there

4306.84 --> 4311.88
is an inside of the

4309.4 --> 4314.04
globe there's an upper surface and

4311.88 --> 4317.719
there's an inner surface that's the

4314.04 --> 4321.28
idea of the hollow Earth it is

4317.719 --> 4325.04
heliocentric in nature just like adds a

4321.28 --> 4327.5599999999995
bit of mystery to that Helia

4325.04 --> 4329.639
centrism and it comes with an inner sun

4327.56 --> 4332.92
too which would be the cause of the heat

4329.639 --> 4332.92
of the terrestrial heat

4341.48 --> 4349.599999999999
somehow what hello duper the celestial

4346.6 --> 4351.52
Loop no the celestials are non-local

4349.6 --> 4354.360000000001
Holograms

4351.52 --> 4357.2390000000005
Luber there's nothing there to Loop

4354.36 --> 4357.239
they're just

4365.56 --> 4373.120000000001
apparitions the loop only applies to the

4368.84 --> 4373.12
physical volume of what is

4374.12 --> 4377.92
available

4375.639 --> 4380.639
what is physically there and how it

4377.92 --> 4383.32
interconnects with the rest of the

4380.639 --> 4386.0
volume yeah the celestials are not part

4383.32 --> 4389.12
of that because they're non-local

4386.0 --> 4394.199
Holograms they aren't anywhere they're

4389.12 --> 4394.199
just apparently manifesting to

4404.12 --> 4407.12
observers

4410.239 --> 4413.36
Tomo 3

4416.0 --> 4422.0
what Godzilla and Kong Hollow Earth yeah

4419.76 --> 4426.0
yeah no the hollow Earth

4422.0 --> 4428.84
is look Hollow Earth is just another

4426.0 --> 4430.76
heliocentric Branch idea that came out

4428.84 --> 4434.04
of Science

4430.76 --> 4437.0
Fiction it is like earliest 20th

4434.04 --> 4441.96
century and it was like one of the more

4437.0 --> 4444.679
obscure ideas but it is being

4441.96 --> 4448.4800000000005
explored and I think it's probably being

4444.679 --> 4451.2390000000005
explored as like in a way to like get

4448.48 --> 4452.919999999999
closer to Flat Earth without making the

4451.239 --> 4456.4
earth

4452.92 --> 4459.4800000000005
flat to explore the surreal

4456.4 --> 4459.48
possibilities as it

4464.04 --> 4470.199
were

4466.639 --> 4473.6
and to potentially address that there

4470.199 --> 4476.0
may be another world or another

4473.6 --> 4478.92
layer to this

4476.0 --> 4481.76
realm that we might even connect

4478.92 --> 4485.76
with

4481.76 --> 4485.76
SH the realm beneath

[Music]

4626.639 --> 4631.0
Giants developing the globe gravity and

4629.36 --> 4633.679
inner

4631.0 --> 4636.88
earth it's good to be talking a little

4633.679 --> 4639.4400000000005
bit of flat earth related subject again

4636.88 --> 4639.4400000000005
it's been a

4643.84 --> 4646.84
while

4653.12 --> 4659.08
the real beneath us okay Woodwork and gy

4656.12 --> 4659.08
bear

4661.199 --> 4668.0
what why would you think it's a mirror

4663.679 --> 4668.0
image that's that's just

4673.84 --> 4676.84
weird

4680.6 --> 4686.04
doesn't have to be hel yeah I know

4683.04 --> 4688.48
tactical soap friend but then it's not

4686.04 --> 4693.159
Hollow Earth then it's

4688.48 --> 4695.44
just Shale I mean it has a name it has a

4693.159 --> 4697.28
Biblical name and it's called Shale and

4695.44 --> 4700.96
it is

4697.28 --> 4700.96
like the realm

4703.48 --> 4710.839999999999
underneath and is said to have like

4706.4 --> 4710.839999999999
another type of sun like a purple

4713.28 --> 4719.48
Cloud instead of a

4716.04 --> 4719.48
sun weird

4722.6 --> 4731.8
huh but the point is is that Hollow

4726.0 --> 4734.48
Earth is like by by the the trademark

4731.8 --> 4735.320000000001
Hollow Earth the word combination Hollow

4734.48 --> 4739.799999999999
Earth

4735.32 --> 4743.92
is specifically based on a

4739.8 --> 4746.28
globe that's Hollow Earth is Globe

4743.92 --> 4748.96
based if you're talking

4746.28 --> 4751.679
about Subterranean

4748.96 --> 4756.96
realm the realm beneath

4751.679 --> 4759.6
us Shale then you're referencing a non

4756.96 --> 4762.44
Globe specific

4759.6 --> 4765.4400000000005
conception but as soon as it's Hollow

4762.44 --> 4767.678999999999
Earth that's a globe

4765.44 --> 4769.919999999999
it just is that is how it's that's how

4767.679 --> 4771.639
it's presented every time you see Hollow

4769.92 --> 4776.32
Earth it's

4771.639 --> 4778.1990000000005
always the inside of a globe always CU

4776.32 --> 4782.12
that is Hollow Earth

4778.199 --> 4782.12
trademark that's just what it

4784.4 --> 4790.879999999999
is they should act like you could better

4787.48 --> 4790.879999999999
call it Hollow

4793.639 --> 4799.84
globe

4795.52 --> 4799.84
Hol Globe earth that is kind of what it

4801.89 --> 4806.14
[Music]

4823.639 --> 4826.639
is

4841.719 --> 4845.4800000000005

[Music]

4853.639 --> 4856.13

[Music]

4862.7 --> 4865.88
[Music]

4883.56 --> 4886.56
for

4891.96 --> 4896.6
all right but I've been thinking about

4894.6 --> 4899.56
it again and

4896.6 --> 4901.159000000001
again the idea of that there is a

4899.56 --> 4905.76
specific like

4901.159 --> 4909.679
of a firmament piece of

4905.76 --> 4913.52
glass that might be at the top like it

4909.679 --> 4917.0
might be that the firmament is the

4913.52 --> 4919.96
projector that is actually creating the

4917.0 --> 4924.679
non-local holographic angular

4919.96 --> 4924.679
manifestation comparable to a lens

4925.4 --> 4931.879999999999
except theoretically if you try to trace

4929.159 --> 4934.879999999999
back the celestial lights you would

4931.88 --> 4938.52
always end up bumping if that's even

4934.88 --> 4943.52
physically possible into the

4938.52 --> 4945.84
barrier boom and that they' remain

4943.52 --> 4949.6
Beyond

4945.84 --> 4953.08
you'd see them at an apparent distance

4949.6 --> 4957.159000000001
beyond the barrier but that would only

4953.08 --> 4960.679
add to the entire non-local

4957.159 --> 4963.679
holographic aspect of

4960.679 --> 4967.56
them cuz there's not definitely nothing

4963.679 --> 4970.04
physical that's going to be beyond the

4967.56 --> 4972.679
barrier like in

4970.04 --> 4976.44
what it it will remain like one of those

4972.679 --> 4976.4400000000005
things that is like completely

4977.88 --> 4983.84
unknowable like yeah we see the

4979.84 --> 4986.360000000001
celestial lights Beyond and we can't get

4983.84 --> 4988.679
there like you you can't even be sure

4986.36 --> 4990.719
there is anything beyond the barrier but

4988.679 --> 4993.84
that's where you would see the celestial

4990.719 --> 4997.0
lights if you try to trace them if you

4993.84 --> 4999.04
try to go towards them they' be forever

4997.0 --> 5000.88
Out Of Reach and then eventually the

4999.04 --> 5004.04
barrier would prevent you from getting

5000.88 --> 5006.6
there if you see anything at all if they

5004.04 --> 5008.84
don't just disappear from your site

5006.6 --> 5011.2390000000005
entirely with only

5008.84 --> 5014.96
black

5011.239 --> 5018.839999999999
remaining right but logically if there

5014.96 --> 5022.08
is some kind of thing that is projecting

5018.84 --> 5024.32
them it would be the firmament that's

5022.08 --> 5026.28
doing that that's projecting the

5024.32 --> 5029.08
non-local holographic angular

5026.28 --> 5031.88
manifestations within the realm that

5029.08 --> 5035.44
would also explain how in

5031.88 --> 5039.96
Shale they wouldn't project

5035.44 --> 5039.96
because there is no firmament in

5041.6 --> 5047.88
Shale

5044.4 --> 5051.96
right so instead of seeing the firmament

5047.88 --> 5055.8
like a glass Dome and like outside of it

5051.96 --> 5058.639
are the celestial things shining through

5055.8 --> 5061.96
it using it like a Looking

5058.639 --> 5066.32
Glass I'd rather see the firmament as

5061.96 --> 5066.32
like a natural projector

5066.8 --> 5073.56
the glass is like a a crystal projector

5070.4 --> 5078.599999999999
that creates the celestial

5073.56 --> 5078.6
lights within the volume underneath

5090.4 --> 5095.04
it still trying to figure out what

5092.84 --> 5096.28
angular manifestation means

5095.04 --> 5098.48
well it

5096.28 --> 5101.639
means that it is an angular

5098.48 --> 5104.48
manifestation that the manifestation is

5101.639 --> 5106.76
angular we see the celestial lights at

5104.48 --> 5110.678999999999
Angles including the sunlight they come

5106.76 --> 5114.76
in at an angle but when you try to find

5110.679 --> 5119.159
the origin point of that manifestation

5114.76 --> 5121.280000000001
it's not there so it literally angularly

5119.159 --> 5124.879999999999
manifests from

5121.28 --> 5128.639
nothing from Not An Origin point from

5124.88 --> 5131.88
not an object that shines like a light

5128.639 --> 5133.719
that causes all that it manifests out of

5131.88 --> 5135.4400000000005
nothing and that's why I call it an

5133.719 --> 5140.32
angular

5135.44 --> 5140.32
manifestation because there's no origin

5141.0 --> 5144.0
object

5150.8 --> 5156.2390000000005
duper

5153.239 --> 5156.239
okay

5159.84 --> 5165.56
right but yeah I mean the whole thing is

5163.52 --> 5169.92
just a hint you know I don't know what

5165.56 --> 5173.119000000001
causes the non-local holographic angular

5169.92 --> 5177.159
manifestations I can guess but a hint

5173.119 --> 5180.799999999999
could be a potential crystal glass

5177.159 --> 5185.679
firmament that is part of the

5180.8 --> 5189.159000000001
projector of it somehow how I don't know

5185.679 --> 5191.4
man but it's one hell of a design from

5189.159 --> 5191.4
the

5192.119 --> 5197.839999999999
designer but if you're going to argue

5195.199 --> 5200.879999999999
like oh if it's a hologram then what's

5197.84 --> 5204.4400000000005
projecting the Hologram well the

5200.88 --> 5207.88
firmament might be there is a reference

5204.44 --> 5212.36
to it in the Bible even say like that

5207.88 --> 5216.119
the celestials are inside of the

5212.36 --> 5219.48
firmament that's a pretty Telltale hint

5216.119 --> 5222.719
if you ask me so yeah the firmament

5219.48 --> 5227.28
which might be a flat top we don't know

5222.719 --> 5230.0
what it is may be effectively the

5227.28 --> 5233.119
technologically from the designer the

5230.0 --> 5235.199
projector that creates the non-local

5233.119 --> 5237.159
holographic angular manifestations we

5235.199 --> 5239.239
know as the celestial lights including

5237.159 --> 5242.04
the

5239.239 --> 5245.08
Sun that the presence of the

5242.04 --> 5248.5199999999995
firmament does all that

5245.08 --> 5248.5199999999995
and showeth his

5273.119 --> 5277.08
handiwork right

5277.44 --> 5282.799999999999
anyway one and a half hour in don't

5280.32 --> 5286.32
forget the Rogan up the

5282.8 --> 5289.639
show if you like this

5286.32 --> 5293.199
discussion only got

5289.639 --> 5293.1990000000005
three should be

5303.119 --> 5306.119
more

5313.119 --> 5315.4
oh

5315.8 --> 5322.2390000000005
wow lot more Blue Sky just uh came in

5319.8 --> 5322.2390000000005
look at

5331.44 --> 5340.119
that not good it all just blew away all

5336.32 --> 5340.119
those clouds they're just

5342.92 --> 5348.08
gone look at how deep blue that is isn't

5345.88 --> 5348.08
that

5360.96 --> 5365.159
amazing

5363.04 --> 5367.6
boom

5365.159 --> 5370.879999999999
come on show me that deep I want to see

5367.6 --> 5373.52
the deep blue so was kind of tricky

5370.88 --> 5376.52
getting the camera to focus in the right

5373.52 --> 5376.52
way

5376.97 --> 5380.189
[Music]

5383.48 --> 5390.678999999999
H non local non angular local no that's

5388.88 --> 5396.04
not an it's not

5390.679 --> 5396.04
non-angular it is definitely angular

5405.679 --> 5409.52
so don't know where you're getting that

5407.159 --> 5411.239
debatable D other than you have to be

5409.52 --> 5414.6
oppositionally

5411.239 --> 5416.799999999999
defiant but no the way you just

5414.6 --> 5418.96
assembled those words makes no damn

5416.8 --> 5421.2390000000005
sense and definitely doesn't relate to

5418.96 --> 5421.2390000000005
the

5422.96 --> 5427.36
phenomenon

5425.0 --> 5433.6
isn't firmament defined as

5427.36 --> 5433.599999999999
Sky yeah could be L elot ready to talk

5434.5 --> 5439.28
[Music]

5436.239 --> 5441.638999999999
again so yeah firmament can be defined

5439.28 --> 5447.08
as Sky there's all kinds of definitions

5441.639 --> 5447.08
of what it is it's no absolute

5448.44 --> 5454.678999999999
conclusive end point with it though it

5451.719 --> 5457.08
it remains open to spec

5454.679 --> 5461.0
ulation but there is the biblical

5457.08 --> 5462.92
reference that the celestial lights are

5461.0 --> 5465.08
inside of the

5462.92 --> 5469.04
firmament and that can

5465.08 --> 5472.4
be taken in many different ways and I

5469.04 --> 5472.4
just did

5472.48 --> 5478.32
that and basically declared what if the

5475.88 --> 5482.4800000000005
so yeah what if the

5478.32 --> 5485.28
firmament is like a crystal glass

5482.48 --> 5488.159
barrier of some kind not necessarily the

5485.28 --> 5490.48
containment barrier but

5488.159 --> 5493.719
a it would have to be a physical

5490.48 --> 5497.839999999999
structure it can't just be nons space

5493.719 --> 5500.719
right you you could have nons space to

5497.84 --> 5504.08
limit the amount of volume available for

5500.719 --> 5508.199
gas to expand into but non-space

5504.08 --> 5510.5199999999995
wouldn't be able to generate a hologram

5508.199 --> 5512.839999999999
You' need something else and that

5510.52 --> 5515.92
something else could be the

5512.84 --> 5520.159000000001
firmament like the glass

5515.92 --> 5520.159
top before nons

5520.52 --> 5526.679
space there might be like a glass top

5523.679 --> 5528.4400000000005
that's right up to nons space that

5526.679 --> 5529.4
there's literally nothing above it

5528.44 --> 5531.08
nothing at

5529.4 --> 5534.48
all

5531.08 --> 5536.0
but yeah the celestial lights are being

5534.48 --> 5540.759999999999
manifested

5536.0 --> 5544.4
somehow and so the firmament may be the

5540.76 --> 5547.6
the crystal glass projector that is

5544.4 --> 5550.08
causing the non local holographic

5547.6 --> 5550.08
angular

5570.48 --> 5576.919999999999
manifestations thinking of a non-angular

5574.119 --> 5578.88
but still local that makes no damn sense

5576.92 --> 5582.119
debatable

5578.88 --> 5585.36
D local hologram that's just a hologram

5582.119 --> 5587.28
you're just describing a regular

5585.36 --> 5590.719
hologram yeah

5587.28 --> 5593.08
local that's the Holograms that we

5590.719 --> 5594.88
make that's the Holograms that we can

5593.08 --> 5598.36
make you take a piece of glass you like

5594.88 --> 5602.04
a glass pyramid just you shine lights

5598.36 --> 5604.32
into it and then you see an image with a

5602.04 --> 5606.92
proximity that you can approach then the

5604.32 --> 5610.759999999999
angular size of it will increase as you

5606.92 --> 5616.04
approach that's a local holographic

5610.76 --> 5616.04
image that's a regular man-made

5616.32 --> 5622.239
hologram yeah the celestial lights are

5620.119 --> 5624.799999999999
specifically not

5622.239 --> 5629.5199999999995
that there is nothing local about it

5624.8 --> 5632.719
there is no angular size increase upon

5629.52 --> 5634.639
proximity it remains at the edge of

5632.719 --> 5637.4
vision

5634.639 --> 5637.400000000001
wherever you

5637.48 --> 5644.839999999999
go you can't reach the

5642.0 --> 5646.239
celestials you can't get closer and

5644.84 --> 5648.76
touch them not within the third

5646.239 --> 5652.678999999999
dimension anyway that's the whole point

5648.76 --> 5652.679
that's why I started calling

5655.52 --> 5660.92
them the non-local holographic angular

5658.679 --> 5662.719
manifestations specifically because of

5660.92 --> 5665.719
those

5662.719 --> 5665.719
traits

5669.28 --> 5675.719
yeah realize that those words is not

5672.199 --> 5678.239
just magic made of words it's an attempt

5675.719 --> 5682.119
to describe the

5678.239 --> 5684.5199999999995
phenomenon based on the available

5682.119 --> 5687.92
knowledge that's what I

5684.52 --> 5691.88
do I attempt

5687.92 --> 5694.1990000000005
to describe the phenomenon based on the

5691.88 --> 5696.8
knowledge available

5694.199 --> 5696.799999999999
it's what I

5698.16 --> 5701.38
[Music]

5707.87 --> 5711.0289999999995
[Music]

5722.639 --> 5725.639
do

5752.639 --> 5755.639
e

5782.56 --> 5785.56
okay

5789.04 --> 5797.88
raise as more detailed description of

5793.0 --> 5797.88
the parameter what what does that

5802.08 --> 5807.8
mean yeah the light the celestial lights

5805.48 --> 5810.839999999999
are manifesting

5807.8 --> 5813.08
angularly they're coming in at an angle

5810.84 --> 5817.0
they're just coming in at an angle

5813.08 --> 5817.0
without a origin

5818.719 --> 5824.639
point they're not coming from anything

5824.679 --> 5833.04
physical they're not coming from a light

5827.76 --> 5837.08
bulb that is physically in a location

5833.04 --> 5837.08
anywhere that's the point about

5837.719 --> 5844.6
it yeah you have a lamp the lamp shines

5842.08 --> 5847.76
energy shines light

5844.6 --> 5851.360000000001
the light is visible at a distance

5847.76 --> 5853.56
yeah now take all of that process take

5851.36 --> 5857.599999999999
away the light bulb and there you have

5853.56 --> 5859.56
it the celestial lights you still see it

5857.6 --> 5862.639
there's something coming towards you

5859.56 --> 5866.599
it's just not coming from that actual

5862.639 --> 5868.96
location that you see it's an angular

5866.599 --> 5872.0
manifestation and if you try to move

5868.96 --> 5875.44
there it will just move along with you

5872.0 --> 5875.44
forever Out Of Reach

5882.01 --> 5885.189
[Music]

5887.639 --> 5892.639
oh thanks for the explanation you think

5890.32 --> 5896.08
you finally get it you're off to rest

5892.639 --> 5899.96
because you're sick

5896.08 --> 5899.96
okay I'll get better

5902.44 --> 5905.44
soon

5911.599 --> 5916.76
make sure

5912.92 --> 5920.32
to stay off the sugar and alcohol as

5916.76 --> 5924.360000000001
much as you can around this

5920.32 --> 5928.239
time don't give into fear or

5924.36 --> 5931.32
Panic don't get carried away in with OV

5928.239 --> 5935.44
excitement and anything just keep it

5931.32 --> 5935.44
calm don't be afraid

5942.52 --> 5949.719
if you fail to do that you will probably

5945.599 --> 5953.84
get sick and it's not like oh you failed

5949.719 --> 5956.04
you got sick it's very likely for most

5953.84 --> 5958.92
people to fail like previous years

5956.04 --> 5962.0
around this time I would always

5958.92 --> 5964.52
fail and get

5962.0 --> 5966.96
sick this might be one of the first

5964.52 --> 5968.96
years where I'm not doing that where I'm

5966.96 --> 5972.8
actually succeeding

5968.96 --> 5977.36
because I saw it coming this time

5972.8 --> 5981.52
there's like more importance to it for

5977.36 --> 5981.5199999999995
me to do it right this

5992.32 --> 5995.32
time

6014.76 --> 6018.84
all right anyway I hope you guys are

6016.28 --> 6018.84
enjoying the

6022.32 --> 6027.5599999999995
show might be a bit difficult for

6025.08 --> 6030.679
listeners to switch back and forth to

6027.56 --> 6032.4400000000005
like oh developing the globe and ideas

6030.679 --> 6034.96
about that and what did they mean where

6032.44 --> 6037.28
did it come from to like oh yeah and

6034.96 --> 6040.159
here's Arn's Vision

6037.28 --> 6043.4
about the Flat Earth model and its

6040.159 --> 6046.48
surreal components how that

6043.4 --> 6048.0
works this it might be a bit of a tough

6046.48 --> 6050.879999999999
switch back and

6048.0 --> 6053.56
forth I mean I'm kind of used to it by

6050.88 --> 6057.639
now like I don't have concentration

6053.56 --> 6057.639
problems keeping them apart at

6064.599 --> 6069.96
all but especially if you're new to all

6067.32 --> 6072.88
of this this might be like what what is

6069.96 --> 6075.8
he talking about what does that

6072.88 --> 6078.56
mean what do you mean non-local

6075.8 --> 6081.2390000000005
holographic angular manifestation even

6078.56 --> 6084.4400000000005
though I just explain it you'll still be

6081.239 --> 6086.36
like okay but what does that

6084.44 --> 6088.598999999999
mean I get

6086.36 --> 6092.36
it it

6088.599 --> 6096.719
is one of the more surreal

6092.36 --> 6096.719
components of my model of the Flat

6099.36 --> 6106.119
Earth you're regarded what what does

6103.92 --> 6106.119
that

6112.239 --> 6115.239
mean

6116.36 --> 6121.719
all right so anyway if you guys can be

6119.76 --> 6124.280000000001
here in the chat I'd really appreciate

6121.719 --> 6127.96
it if you actually gave the show a

6124.28 --> 6127.96
thumbs up a Rogan

6130.48 --> 6136.839999999999
up that's how [ __ ] spell

6133.84 --> 6136.84
[ __ ]

6142.159 --> 6145.159
okay

6150.4 --> 6154.638999999999
I didn't see that

6154.84 --> 6158.639
sorry I'm not assuming that any of you

6157.32 --> 6162.599
are

6158.639 --> 6165.52
[ __ ] I mean if you are

6162.599 --> 6168.119000000001
that's that's just your

6165.52 --> 6171.080000000001
problem I mean sometimes it takes a lot

6168.119 --> 6174.5599999999995
of time to catch up

6171.08 --> 6177.96
sometimes the ideas that we we've

6174.56 --> 6180.8
gathered in our lives are very

6177.96 --> 6182.08
tenacious and have given you a lot of

6180.8 --> 6185.599
important

6182.08 --> 6188.84
grip to have any kind of stable position

6185.599 --> 6192.32
in regards to these lines of

6188.84 --> 6195.119000000001
questioning about the nature of Earth

6192.32 --> 6197.159
and me coming in with like completely

6195.119 --> 6200.5199999999995
radical different ideas that don't

6197.159 --> 6202.759999999999
comport with those conceptions yeah it

6200.52 --> 6203.679
makes it very tough for people to to

6202.76 --> 6206.1990000000005
like

6203.679 --> 6208.2390000000005
understand what I'm even talking about

6206.199 --> 6211.08
so every

6208.239 --> 6213.759999999999
time non-local holographic angular

6211.08 --> 6218.239
manifestations comes up as a subject I'm

6213.76 --> 6221.08
expecting it without any remorse or

6218.239 --> 6224.4
Grudge that I'll have to explain it like

6221.08 --> 6226.92
20 times every single time it comes up I

6224.4 --> 6228.759999999999
totally expect that don't worry about it

6226.92 --> 6229.599
I will I will do it because it's like

6228.76 --> 6233.56
one of

6229.599 --> 6236.28
those mind [ __ ] about reality that's

6233.56 --> 6239.52
like yeah yeah I

6236.28 --> 6242.759999999999
know it's really tough on the mind I

6239.52 --> 6245.56
know so I'm fully expecting to have to

6242.76 --> 6248.2390000000005
explain it over and over again even to

6245.56 --> 6251.1990000000005
the same individuals that seem to have

6248.239 --> 6253.28
understood it at some point and then

6251.199 --> 6255.32
after some time they'll just forget it

6253.28 --> 6257.639
again they'll just not understand it

6255.32 --> 6260.5599999999995
again I get

6257.639 --> 6263.84
it it's what I'm here

6260.56 --> 6267.4400000000005
for to make the inexplicable

6263.84 --> 6267.4400000000005
explicable that's what I

6281.8 --> 6288.4400000000005
do

6283.84 --> 6292.04
right and even in my explanations there

6288.44 --> 6295.04
is relatively slow

6292.04 --> 6297.88
progress

6295.04 --> 6300.28
I mean once an idea fully crystallizes

6297.88 --> 6300.28
it's

6301.639 --> 6306.8
there in all its surreal Glory but that

6304.92 --> 6310.119
doesn't mean that I can just quickly

6306.8 --> 6312.96
move on to explain like how that is done

6310.119 --> 6316.759999999999
or how that is manifested or where it

6312.96 --> 6316.76
comes from like no

6321.96 --> 6324.96
no

6343.84 --> 6348.639
ah I got six rogans now that's good

6346.4 --> 6348.638999999999
that's

6349.56 --> 6353.84
better it's more in line with how many

6352.119 --> 6355.639
people are actually

6353.84 --> 6358.52
talking in

6355.639 --> 6362.2390000000005
chat I mean I want during the live show

6358.52 --> 6364.639
I want at least enough thumbs up to

6362.239 --> 6366.839999999999
equate just the amount of participants

6364.639 --> 6371.639
in the chat otherwise you're just being

6366.84 --> 6371.639
in chat and not raning it up that's just

6375.52 --> 6381.92
rude give me one I know thank you

6379.36 --> 6384.92
tactical soap

6381.92 --> 6384.92
friend

6411.84 --> 6414.84
h

6422.88 --> 6429.56
any more Eclipse rumors out

6426.76 --> 6432.56
there I mean there is this food idea

6429.56 --> 6435.4400000000005
about it that being highly exaggerated

6432.56 --> 6438.88
but there might be something to it like

6435.44 --> 6438.879999999999
don't leave your milk

6439.08 --> 6447.5599999999995
out in the

6441.48 --> 6447.5599999999995
eclipse don't pick any herbs during the

6448.239 --> 6456.119
eclipse don't leave your meat out the

6452.08 --> 6458.32
the sun dry during the eclipse right

6456.119 --> 6460.239
those might be solid tips doesn't mean

6458.32 --> 6463.599
that oh you can't eat

6460.239 --> 6466.48
anything but you might want to like cook

6463.599 --> 6469.84
and prepare your meals for the day of

6466.48 --> 6472.44
the eclipse a day before the

6469.84 --> 6474.679
eclipse and then like store it in the

6472.44 --> 6478.04
fridge nice and covered

6474.679 --> 6480.8
up that might be a

6478.04 --> 6483.88
thing that you might want to

6480.8 --> 6486.04
do but I mean even if you don't even if

6483.88 --> 6489.88
you do decide to like oh no I am going

6486.04 --> 6492.32
to leave out my milk during the eclipse

6489.88 --> 6494.28
you hear and I'm going to sundry my meat

6492.32 --> 6496.199
during the eclipse and I'm going to use

6494.28 --> 6497.96
all the herbs that I pick during the

6496.199 --> 6500.36
eclipse and I'm going to make a dinner

6497.96 --> 6501.96
with that well what's the worst thing

6500.36 --> 6503.759999999999
that could happen you could probably

6501.96 --> 6507.639
have like

6503.76 --> 6510.84
a lot of extra bubble bubbly stuff going

6507.639 --> 6512.88
on in your guts and maybe some gas or

6510.84 --> 6514.1990000000005
something I mean that is what I imagine

6512.88 --> 6516.92
would be the worst thing that would

6514.199 --> 6520.5199999999995
happen then I mean I doubt you'd

6516.92 --> 6524.04
actually get sick from that unless

6520.52 --> 6527.1990000000005
your your yeah metabolism and overall

6524.04 --> 6527.199
condition isn't all that

6529.719 --> 6536.719
great but there's probably something do

6533.199 --> 6539.119
it it's just being overblown like

6536.719 --> 6542.52
everything is being overblown right now

6539.119 --> 6542.5199999999995
with all the fear pouring out

6549.08 --> 6554.159
there watching to see if your form

6551.44 --> 6554.159
animals act

6555.44 --> 6561.28
weird all right well if you have

6561.719 --> 6569.2390000000005
like baby animals right that are still

6566.08 --> 6573.639
drinking milk from the

6569.239 --> 6573.638999999999
mother they might get weird

6583.159 --> 6589.44
issues like as if they're left out I

6586.44 --> 6592.48
mean if you just keep them inside with a

6589.44 --> 6594.638999999999
roof over their heads it'll probably be

6592.48 --> 6596.799999999999
just just fine without anything out of

6594.639 --> 6596.8
the

6603.8 --> 6609.88
ordinary bear porn gets the clips yeah

6607.0 --> 6612.28
yeah yeah yeah and oh man they're

6609.88 --> 6616.119
they're they're really putting it out

6612.28 --> 6616.119
there you know what's happening

6617.92 --> 6625.32
right I mean the eclipse is coming

6621.639 --> 6627.400000000001
and and NASA sending sending three

6625.32 --> 6630.44
rockets to the

6627.4 --> 6632.36
eclipse and the large hedrin collider is

6630.44 --> 6635.598999999999
going to fire up during the eclipse and

6632.36 --> 6639.199
the devil comet is visible during the

6635.599 --> 6641.400000000001
eclipse and it's like they're all coming

6639.199 --> 6644.759999999999
out of the Woodworks and all like doing

6641.4 --> 6647.239
ritual simultaneously and it's like oh

6644.76 --> 6649.679
and the red haer oh they're preparing

6647.239 --> 6651.799999999999
their red haers for the sacrifice the

6649.679 --> 6653.4800000000005
Antichrist might be coming whatever the

6651.8 --> 6657.360000000001
hell that means

6653.48 --> 6659.4
some small Goblin [ __ ] guy that's

6657.36 --> 6661.598999999999
going to claim ownership over the world

6659.4 --> 6661.598999999999
or

6661.92 --> 6669.96
something like they're hyping it up like

6666.36 --> 6669.96
nothing out there like

6681.56 --> 6684.56
crazy

6692.8 --> 6699.56
we have nine baby goats in a new paint

6696.56 --> 6699.56
boil

6702.76 --> 6709.079000000001
right it's also

6706.48 --> 6712.36
tiresome yeah it is it's and it's over

6709.079 --> 6717.0
the top it's over the top how much how

6712.36 --> 6721.159
much much they put weight onto it but I

6717.0 --> 6723.44
mean it does just show the desperation

6721.159 --> 6727.04
it's again

6723.44 --> 6730.719
it's it's the darkness

6727.04 --> 6735.679
clawing clawing at us trying to pull us

6730.719 --> 6735.679
with it as it's basically losing

6740.36 --> 6746.04
grip all the same grip no no it's not

6743.88 --> 6749.1990000000005
the same

6746.04 --> 6751.28
grift it is there is something else like

6749.199 --> 6755.159
there is something happening it's just

6751.28 --> 6755.159
that they're piling on

6758.079 --> 6763.04
everything I mean 2012 was just the end

6761.239 --> 6768.718999999999
of the Mayan

6763.04 --> 6768.719
calendar y 2K was a computer glitch

6769.76 --> 6776.599
allegedly but this eclipse

6773.28 --> 6779.719
is effectively kind of significant in

6776.599 --> 6781.679
different ways there's also there's a

6779.719 --> 6786.4800000000005
calendar

6781.679 --> 6790.639
switch like this Eclipse May truly be

6786.48 --> 6794.4
the dawn of the New Age of Aquarius like

6790.639 --> 6797.639
the actual moment where astrologically

6794.4 --> 6801.44
the age of Aquarius now really

6797.639 --> 6802.8
starts the age of Aquarius like that

6801.44 --> 6805.759999999999
whole thing that they've been talking

6802.8 --> 6808.1990000000005
about forever and of course it's a

6805.76 --> 6811.8
transition but like

6808.199 --> 6811.799999999999
astrologically so I've

6813.0 --> 6821.8
heard like that's the official

6818.0 --> 6821.8
moment where it really

6827.159 --> 6834.0
starts right and then there is the

6830.599 --> 6836.88
typical top down mind control satanic

6834.0 --> 6839.28
top down mind control effect of if there

6836.88 --> 6840.4400000000005
is they do this with every new year on

6839.28 --> 6843.0
every

6840.44 --> 6845.719
calendar if there's a new year they have

6843.0 --> 6850.32
to like do some dark ritual to try to

6845.719 --> 6855.04
insert desperation and fear into the new

6850.32 --> 6859.159
year so that there's no room to let

6855.04 --> 6860.679
people grow naturally in with

6859.159 --> 6863.638999999999
yeah

6860.679 --> 6865.8
right to buy past the natural

6863.639 --> 6869.96
development and that's why these dark

6865.8 --> 6873.719
rituals happen to distract you away

6869.96 --> 6874.8
from the Grassroots development of your

6873.719 --> 6878.2390000000005
own

6874.8 --> 6881.96
energies in anticipation of the new

6878.239 --> 6884.48
year that's part of these dark rituals

6881.96 --> 6887.44
that's why they keep happening at these

6884.48 --> 6889.759999999999
times it's why usually like the first of

6887.44 --> 6892.119
January there's some weird [ __ ]

6889.76 --> 6895.1990000000005
happening in government they they sign

6892.119 --> 6897.639
in some messed up Bill right and when

6895.199 --> 6899.919999999999
the Chinese New Year happens they they

6897.639 --> 6903.32
usually do a ritual thing that's

6899.92 --> 6905.76
terrible like they do this all over the

6903.32 --> 6910.04
place and this one is just really

6905.76 --> 6914.119000000001
significant because it is the official

6910.04 --> 6915.719
age the dawn of the age of Aquarius yeah

6914.119 --> 6918.96
the new Cali

6915.719 --> 6921.079
Yuga that's right that's it's really

6918.96 --> 6924.88
that that is it that's what that is

6921.079 --> 6924.88
that's what eth of April

6925.52 --> 6932.280000000001
is like there's no more vagueness like

6928.719 --> 6935.719
around this no this is it this is it

6932.28 --> 6941.4
this is the true astrological dawning of

6935.719 --> 6941.4
the age of Aquarius April e this is

6942.159 --> 6948.199
it and since all the powers are going to

6946.48 --> 6951.36
astrologically

6948.199 --> 6953.919999999999
shift there is a true desperation from

6951.36 --> 6956.239
the top down power powers from the

6953.92 --> 6959.4
Earthly powers to

6956.239 --> 6962.839999999999
inject desperation in the hopes of

6959.4 --> 6965.839999999999
regaining a new grip in this age of

6962.84 --> 6969.1990000000005
Aquarius which is very unlikely to work

6965.84 --> 6970.84
and even now with people that are

6969.199 --> 6973.199
halfway ignorant that still believe in

6970.84 --> 6975.2390000000005
the globe nonsense that still think that

6973.199 --> 6979.32
the large hedron collider might open a

6975.239 --> 6983.4
portal to the hell like all those people

6979.32 --> 6987.36
that are easily drawn into a porn

6983.4 --> 6990.598999999999
spiraling even they are starting to be

6987.36 --> 6994.159
like this is just ridiculous like this

6990.599 --> 6996.679
is this can't be real they're having the

6994.159 --> 6999.199
mat

6996.679 --> 7001.04
effect the matte Quantum of conscious

6999.199 --> 7003.759999999999
they're just starting to feel like this

7001.04 --> 7008.76
can't be real

7003.76 --> 7011.8
like it's it's over the top it doesn't

7008.76 --> 7013.4400000000005
feel as desperate as it is being

7011.8 --> 7017.2390000000005
portrayed

7013.44 --> 7020.719
trade it's starting to feel fake even to

7017.239 --> 7023.32
those that are normally very very easily

7020.719 --> 7026.4
drawn into fear porn

7023.32 --> 7029.119
spiraling I'm getting that I'm seeing it

7026.4 --> 7032.638999999999
people that I normally would typically

7029.119 --> 7034.92
Echo the fear porn a lot and amplify it

7032.639 --> 7037.4400000000005
even they are just starting to notice

7034.92 --> 7040.4
like

7037.44 --> 7044.5599999999995
n it all just seems kind of

7040.4 --> 7047.4
nonsensical yeah a shift big

7044.56 --> 7050.679
shift so the best tip the best way to

7047.4 --> 7053.638999999999
counter aramon to counter the Earthly

7050.679 --> 7058.96
powers and their desperate

7053.639 --> 7061.36
control is to not be afraid of anything

7058.96 --> 7066.36
not be afraid of anything including

7061.36 --> 7066.36
death or life or

7069.0 --> 7073.119
change don't be

7071.119 --> 7075.239
afraid

7073.119 --> 7078.44
that's the best thing you can

7075.239 --> 7082.199
do and then if you're not afraid then

7078.44 --> 7085.96
that lack of fear will leave

7082.199 --> 7090.879999999999
room that might be harder to take

7085.96 --> 7093.44
away in the new age by the Earthly like

7090.88 --> 7095.32
you will become

7093.44 --> 7098.919999999999
spiritually

7095.32 --> 7098.92
immunized if you do

7101.119 --> 7105.159
it

7102.639 --> 7108.2390000000005
the darkness will have

7105.159 --> 7112.48
potentially on a permanent base less

7108.239 --> 7113.718999999999
grip on you if you now focus on not

7112.48 --> 7117.079
being

7113.719 --> 7119.76
afraid through this

7117.079 --> 7123.88
transition it's could be quite

7119.76 --> 7123.88
significant I'm definitely going to do

7126.8 --> 7132.84
that right I mean wouldn't it be great

7129.48 --> 7135.239
to go into a new age of Aquarius

7132.84 --> 7139.0
being spiritually

7135.239 --> 7143.199
immune to the darkness the darkness that

7139.0 --> 7146.119
has been on our backs for our entire

7143.199 --> 7149.678999999999
lifetime and generations before that

7146.119 --> 7152.239
even to suddenly be released from that

7149.679 --> 7152.2390000000005
cloak of

7153.92 --> 7158.119
Darkness wouldn't it be worth a

7159.239 --> 7164.48
try seems to me like it is definitely

7162.119 --> 7164.48
worth a

7165.159 --> 7171.638999999999
try so just don't be

7168.599 --> 7172.639
afraid trust in God trust in the design

7171.639 --> 7175.719
trust

7172.639 --> 7179.079
in the endless

7175.719 --> 7182.8
Miracle of the design

7179.079 --> 7185.92
and the more we learn the more we learn

7182.8 --> 7189.400000000001
about how we don't understand the

7185.92 --> 7191.8
details that we kind of like just

7189.4 --> 7194.44
oversimplified it so we could make it

7191.8 --> 7198.1990000000005
fit in our minds easier but then when

7194.44 --> 7202.48
you really look at it honestly the

7198.199 --> 7206.5599999999995
details you just know like

7202.48 --> 7211.678999999999
damn it is just so much more complicated

7206.56 --> 7215.4800000000005
than than our our normalization minds

7211.679 --> 7216.599
are are used to like reality is just

7215.48 --> 7220.28
more

7216.599 --> 7223.96
surreal than we end up

7220.28 --> 7223.96
thinking among one another

7224.079 --> 7229.719
humans oversimplify things so that the

7226.719 --> 7232.079
communication about it is easier but the

7229.719 --> 7236.639
reality is is that things are just way

7232.079 --> 7239.719
more surreal than we can handle or were

7236.639 --> 7242.4800000000005
able to handle we might become more

7239.719 --> 7245.56
capable of handling The Surreal nature

7242.48 --> 7248.718999999999
of reality I've been working on it very

7245.56 --> 7248.719
hard you might have

7249.199 --> 7254.759999999999
noticed or you're just like ridiculous

7252.679 --> 7257.599
Arwin what a bunch of nonsense oh he's

7254.76 --> 7260.84
just talking crazy again Arn's talking

7257.599 --> 7263.679
crazy again yeah well [ __ ] you reality

7260.84 --> 7266.88
is crazy I'm just here to try to figure

7263.679 --> 7271.76
out how crazy reality really

is yeah and craziness without

7272.639 --> 7280.92
fear yeah the non fearful

7278.079 --> 7283.48
craz of this

7280.92 --> 7285.159
reality The Surreal nature of it I'm

7283.48 --> 7288.28
working on it I'm trying to figure it

7285.159 --> 7290.638999999999
out I'm I'm I think I'm like pretty far

7288.28 --> 7290.639
ahead

7293.0 --> 7296.599
already and I'm definitely going to

7295.32 --> 7298.88
continue and I'm not going to be

7296.599 --> 7303.2390000000005
dissuaded by

7298.88 --> 7306.84
anybody that's going to attempt to futy

7303.239 --> 7309.678999999999

7306.84 --> 7314.92
mean good luck with

7309.679 --> 7314.92
that I'm helium you you ain't pulling me

7320.89 --> 7324.02

7327.52 --> 7331.56
know I'm helium I'm going to go

7332.36 --> 7337.119
up I'm going to go up or I'm going to go

7334.96 --> 7339.679
in all directions but you can't keep me

7337.119 --> 7339.679
down for

7340.84 --> 7348.64
long

7342.67 --> 7348.64
[Music]

7363.679 --> 7369.88
right and I hope to be able

7366.96 --> 7373.32
to pull you guys up with

7369.88 --> 7376.679
me if if you'll have if you'll have it I

7373.32 --> 7379.5599999999995
mean not going to force you to to go

7376.679 --> 7382.0
along with me but I promise it's going

7379.56 --> 7382.0
to be

7398.679 --> 7404.8
interesting you have a brindle Jersey

7401.56 --> 7409.04
have for jeez my homie so no sacrifice

7404.8 --> 7409.04
yeah I mean red halfer sacrifices are

7412.28 --> 7417.04
stupid supposedly it's not like the

7415.44 --> 7419.799999999999
whole thing that summoning the

7417.04 --> 7421.119
Antichrist with the red heer it may

7419.8 --> 7424.88
simply

7421.119 --> 7428.199
be a giant rumor that's not even

7424.88 --> 7432.400000000001
actually based in anything

7428.199 --> 7434.839999999999
biblical I heard out there that halfer

7432.4 --> 7437.0
sacrifice actually has to do

7434.84 --> 7439.76
with

7437.0 --> 7442.28
purification from the blood which is all

7439.76 --> 7444.159000000001
very Pagan really well they have to

7442.28 --> 7447.639
cover themselves in the blood because

7444.159 --> 7450.04
they're going to be dealing treating and

7447.639 --> 7454.4400000000005
touching a dead

7450.04 --> 7458.76
body which is apparently a thing in

7454.44 --> 7461.48
Judaism that that's where it's for so I

7458.76 --> 7463.88
mean if anything red haer sacrifices

7461.48 --> 7466.48
would be an indication of a potential

7463.88 --> 7466.4800000000005
Zombie

7467.0 --> 7471.44
Apocalypse Zombie Armageddon I mean an

7469.48 --> 7474.36
apocalypse is just a revealing I mean

7471.44 --> 7478.079
the zombie apocalypse is already here

7474.36 --> 7482.119
yeah knowledge is revealed and then we

7478.079 --> 7486.5199999999995
get to see how many people are actually

7482.119 --> 7486.5199999999995
zombies yeah zombie

7487.079 --> 7491.96
apocalypse you get to know what's real

7489.8 --> 7494.159000000001
you get to figure it out the illusion is

7491.96 --> 7496.4
lifted and then you get to see how many

7494.159 --> 7498.799999999999
people are the

7496.4 --> 7503.04
zombies living

7498.8 --> 7506.88
zombies that are driven by illusion and

7503.04 --> 7506.88
fear that's the zombie

7520.639 --> 7523.639
apocalypse

7532.88 --> 7536.079
no all

7550.639 --> 7553.639
right

7564.92 --> 7570.88
so yeah red

7567.4 --> 7573.96
heer is it really for the Antichrist

7570.88 --> 7577.96
well is the Antichrist dead some kind of

7573.96 --> 7577.96
dead being being brought to

7578.8 --> 7588.1990000000005
life it's weird

7583.52 --> 7590.119000000001
I mean if the Antichrist is already like

7588.199 --> 7595.5199999999995
would he be born

7590.119 --> 7595.5199999999995
then or would he simply step out of the

7600.8 --> 7605.28
Shadows what is the red haer really

7610.52 --> 7616.119000000001
for

7613.239 --> 7618.5199999999995
I mean according to this this new

7616.119 --> 7620.88
insight it would be there for sudden

7618.52 --> 7623.599
death if there's a sudden death of some

7620.88 --> 7627.679
kind then you need to be covered in

7623.599 --> 7631.32
blood of the red heer to stay pure while

7627.679 --> 7631.32
touching those dead

7634.4 --> 7640.558999999999
bodies right so maybe they'll do the red

7637.239 --> 7643.0
heer ritual if suddenly out of nowhere a

7640.559 --> 7645.719
lot of people just start dropping dead

7643.0 --> 7648.44
and who know maybe that will happen

7645.719 --> 7651.44
right maybe it will happen to a whole

7648.44 --> 7655.119
range of people that have been part of a

7651.44 --> 7659.159
big medical experiment and then suddenly

7655.119 --> 7661.839999999999
like all of them drop over it could

7659.159 --> 7665.759999999999
happen I can't exclude something like

7661.84 --> 7666.88
that from happening who knows man I mean

7665.76 --> 7669.360000000001
if the

7666.88 --> 7673.4400000000005
eclipse is going to have some weird

7669.36 --> 7673.44
influence on bacteria

7674.239 --> 7678.598999999999
then maybe it will have some weird

7676.36 --> 7680.88
influence on people that have been

7678.599 --> 7683.400000000001
subjected to Medical experimentation as

7680.88 --> 7683.400000000001
well who

7685.44 --> 7691.36
knows how does this all fit

7688.52 --> 7694.92
together we don't

7691.36 --> 7697.0
know we can't be certain but there's a

7694.92 --> 7700.4400000000005
lot of hassle being made there's the New

7697.0 --> 7704.92
Age of Aquarius that is really on the

7700.44 --> 7704.919999999999
precipice of happening for

7710.639 --> 7718.079
real and the Earthly powers are afraid

7715.28 --> 7720.84
of losing control over the

7718.079 --> 7724.119
spirits and that's why they're doing so

7720.84 --> 7727.4800000000005
much that's why they're doing so much

7724.119 --> 7730.04
weird rituals in anticipation of the

7727.48 --> 7733.36
event and that's what you got to keep in

7730.04 --> 7736.559
mind and so so if you want to be free

7733.36 --> 7741.88
then just don't be afraid I

7736.559 --> 7744.52
mean Jesus said don't be afraid many

7741.88 --> 7747.84
times in the

7744.52 --> 7751.040000000001
Bible cuz it is probably the most

7747.84 --> 7754.4800000000005
important piece of wisdom he had to

7751.04 --> 7757.559
share I'd say apply that piece of wisdom

7754.48 --> 7760.36
right now in the new

7757.559 --> 7763.4800000000005
age at the dawning of the new age apply

7760.36 --> 7766.759999999999
it right now it's more important than

7763.48 --> 7769.98
ever to do that right now to to follow

7766.76 --> 7773.17
that number one piece of advice from

7769.98 --> 7773.169999999999
[Music]

7790.32 --> 7793.32
Jesus

7820.32 --> 7823.32
e

7828.079 --> 7834.84
right so yeah I hope you're all

7829.76 --> 7838.119000000001
appreciating this show thus

7834.84 --> 7839.88
far I'm a bit in speech mode right now

7838.119 --> 7843.558999999999
so I'm not surprised that people aren't

7839.88 --> 7843.559
really saying a lot right

7850.239 --> 7853.239
now

7880.239 --> 7883.239
for

7891.28 --> 7894.92
right maybe I'll just round out the

7897.36 --> 7901.92
show debate is still going pretty

7903.88 --> 7909.04
late maybe you're all just watching that

7906.559 --> 7910.639
maybe you're all just doing other stuff

7909.04 --> 7913.679
I mean I feel already been saying

7910.639 --> 7913.679
everything that I I could

7922.0 --> 7927.199
say all right but tomorrow apparently is

7924.639 --> 7929.679
going to be a really warm day so I'm

7927.199 --> 7931.28
looking forward to that going to really

just

7991.52 --> 7999.119000000001
interesting bit over the place but uh

7995.559 --> 8001.92
it's good to talk some Globe development

7999.119 --> 8005.4
I rarely talk about that anymore

8001.92 --> 8009.0
but it is still a fun subject for

8005.4 --> 8011.0
me it's just that I don't know a lot of

8009.0 --> 8014.28
other people don't seem to be that

8011.0 --> 8016.599
entertained about it

8014.28 --> 8018.96
anymore but uh

8016.599 --> 8021.4400000000005
