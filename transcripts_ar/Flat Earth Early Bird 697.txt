166.72 --> 172.319
newspaper and yeah i didn't feel like

170.16 --> 174.64
going for groceries like after debate

172.319 --> 178.0
then coming back and then doing

174.64 --> 179.76
my newspapers so i just insisted for

178.0 --> 182.0
myself to do the groceries

179.76 --> 184.72
in the morning but that meant that i

182.0 --> 186.64
kind of had little time

184.72 --> 189.04
to prepare so that's why i'm late sorry

186.64 --> 189.04
about that

196.84 --> 199.84
anyway

197.89 --> 203.04
[Music]

199.84 --> 205.28
yeah yesterday's show was great

203.04 --> 206.56
i i didn't watch it back but i just

205.28 --> 208.56
remember

206.56 --> 209.599
that was pretty good it it yeah if i

208.56 --> 212.879
would have gotten even

209.599 --> 216.319
up even earlier then i might have

212.879 --> 218.319
gotten to watching it again because i i

216.319 --> 219.11999999999998
really felt yesterday's show was very

218.319 --> 223.44
good

219.12 --> 226.87900000000002
also got a couple of very complementary

223.44 --> 229.84
uh comments so

226.879 --> 230.39999999999998
even from ballers so that was nice

229.84 --> 233.439
anyway

230.4 --> 235.84
uh the flat earth debate was also pretty

233.439 --> 235.84
decent

238.799 --> 244.31900000000002
oh yeah and there was a kiwi life but i

242.159 --> 246.879
wasn't part of the show

244.319 --> 248.79899999999998
and like it was actually life i just i

246.879 --> 251.84
didn't feel like being in there

248.799 --> 253.20000000000002
that much and yeah funny thing was

251.84 --> 255.439
nathan was also

253.2 --> 257.03999999999996
in chat i was in chat but nathan didn't

255.439 --> 259.04
really feel like getting on this

257.04 --> 261.6
live show either i think guys i didn't

259.04 --> 265.28000000000003
see him in the discord panel

261.6 --> 266.84000000000003
some others were in there but we stuck

265.28 --> 270.32
to comment

266.84 --> 272.23999999999995
and yeah we sort of even got a little

270.32 --> 276.15999999999997
bit into an argument considering

272.24 --> 283.84000000000003
light and i put down

276.16 --> 283.84000000000003
yeah my argument so far

284.639 --> 291.12
oh god really marco backs

288.479 --> 291.12
what the [ __ ]

294.96 --> 300.15999999999997
yeah they're they're definitely uh

298.479 --> 301.68
in the middle of a perch but it's not

300.16 --> 303.28000000000003
just the netherlands though it's

301.68 --> 311.84000000000003
everywhere it's a lot of people have

303.28 --> 311.84
been deleted

312.88 --> 319.84
old news well your stanford this guy is

316.0 --> 323.84
like a very prominent dutch truther

319.84 --> 324.479
so i didn't know he was deleted as well

323.84 --> 327.44
but

324.479 --> 327.44
i guess he is

328.08 --> 331.199
although i'm pretty sure he'll be able

329.919 --> 339.84
to find

331.199 --> 339.84000000000003
yeah another platform

339.919 --> 344.88
it's getting really ridiculous i know it

342.88 --> 348.88
is

344.88 --> 352.08
yeah yesterday uh as an example

348.88 --> 355.36
yesterday also uh

352.08 --> 358.4
nathan thompson had an upload

355.36 --> 360.639
he didn't really premiere it or did he

358.4 --> 361.84
he had he uploaded something i watched

360.639 --> 364.24
it it was another

361.84 --> 364.96
i guess european doctor's testimony

364.24 --> 367.28000000000003
about

364.96 --> 368.96
how the entire thing is fake how the

367.28 --> 372.0
alarm is fake

368.96 --> 375.59999999999997
and that video was removed not even like

372.0 --> 378.639
15 minutes after after had been uploaded

375.6 --> 380.639
i checked it was just gone

378.639 --> 384.08
so nathan thompson's channel still there

380.639 --> 386.88
but that video was just deleted

384.08 --> 388.56
so it obviously has to do with that the

386.88 --> 390.96
crackdowns i've noticed

388.56 --> 391.68
are specifically focused on people

390.96 --> 396.0
trying to

391.68 --> 398.479
front line against the lockdowns

396.0 --> 399.44
and all that against the specific covet

398.479 --> 401.59999999999997
measures

399.44 --> 402.479
everywhere that's what the crackdown is

401.6 --> 405.12
all for

402.479 --> 405.12
it seems

407.44 --> 414.24
and yeah longer fonts that dutch

411.28 --> 415.35999999999996
conspiracy theorist very front line type

414.24 --> 416.96000000000004
of guy

415.36 --> 420.16
yeah it doesn't surprise me at all

416.96 --> 423.52
because he has been championing

420.16 --> 436.16
yeah that as well

423.52 --> 438.639
all right

436.16 --> 440.0
youtube said a year or more ago yeah

438.639 --> 442.08
well they do

440.0 --> 444.24
they have basically laid it out like

442.08 --> 447.75899999999996
this is the thing that we're cracking

444.24 --> 450.639
down on on this misinformation

447.759 --> 452.8
but i don't know i don't have the

450.639 --> 456.96000000000004
feeling i'm being cracked down on

452.8 --> 460.0
a lot except for yeah the

456.96 --> 462.84
the reach limiter still

460.0 --> 465.36
i have still yet to receive a single

462.84 --> 469.039
strike

465.36 --> 471.12
so and they've never really removed a

469.039 --> 474.96
video of mine either they have

471.12 --> 476.72
at best just demonetize certain ones and

474.96 --> 478.4
that well that's not entirely true there

476.72 --> 482.47900000000004
were two episodes

478.4 --> 486.479
that were completely deleted

482.479 --> 489.919
but that was yeah with the with the

486.479 --> 491.44
christ church situation back then

489.919 --> 493.19899999999996
that one was the lead because it was

491.44 --> 495.199
very acute

493.199 --> 497.199
they really acutely wanted to remove

495.199 --> 499.12
everything about it and i did

497.199 --> 502.72
do that so they removed that and that's

499.12 --> 502.72
it that's like the worst i've ever

504.84 --> 507.84
received

519.68 --> 526.0799999999999
no no hasten slowly i didn't see that

523.279 --> 528.32
although nathan thompson is a very loud

526.08 --> 528.32
guy

528.8 --> 537.68
i don't see that as criminal though

534.88 --> 539.36
and school children what do you mean

537.68 --> 543.12
exactly school children that

539.36 --> 543.12
that could be teenagers as well

546.08 --> 550.08
so hasten slowly you don't need to do

548.399 --> 552.32
that especially that

550.08 --> 553.44
a lot of criminality yeah that's just

552.32 --> 556.88
slander

553.44 --> 556.8800000000001
because the guy is not a criminal

558.88 --> 563.8389999999999
he's just very brazen

579.36 --> 586.48
financial fraud makes the prominent one

582.959 --> 586.4799999999999
can you what are you talking about

586.56 --> 591.8389999999999
which prominent ones

600.72 --> 607.9200000000001
yeah yeah that's right no revelations of

604.32 --> 611.7600000000001
child abuse has nothing to do

607.92 --> 614.079
with any of this this is disgusting

611.76 --> 615.68
hasten slowly if you are literally going

614.079 --> 617.92
to

615.68 --> 620.3199999999999
[ __ ] out that stamp of child abuse in

617.92 --> 623.8389999999999
association with the community like that

620.32 --> 626.0
i'm gonna ban you no no not only here

623.839 --> 629.2
i'm gonna ban you everywhere

626.0 --> 631.92
because that's disgusting

629.2 --> 634.1600000000001
that's disgusting hasten slowly i don't

631.92 --> 637.12
care how smart you are if that's what if

634.16 --> 642.3199999999999
that's what you're gonna put out

637.12 --> 642.32
i'm gonna remove you just like p mars

642.88 --> 646.399
and all those other figures that do that

645.76 --> 661.38
because it's

646.399 --> 663.92
disgusting when you do that

661.38 --> 667.519
[Music]

663.92 --> 670.24
don't be ridiculous again just saying i

667.519 --> 672.839
have a lot of wrenches

670.24 --> 674.0
and if he's going to forward oh child

672.839 --> 677.44
abuse

674.0 --> 680.24
yeah yeah

677.44 --> 681.36
if you're gonna do that you're gonna

680.24 --> 689.839
drop off my

681.36 --> 689.839
grace list permanently just so you know

693.1 --> 699.6
[Music]

696.32 --> 702.8000000000001
yeah he did tarpon stamp

699.6 --> 705.9200000000001
now he retracted these messages but

702.8 --> 709.04
yeah they're still recorded here over in

705.92 --> 709.04
my chat in the left

710.399 --> 715.519
but maybe he just flopped that out

712.24 --> 718.0
didn't really think what he was saying

715.519 --> 719.44
because yeah even intelligent people do

718.0 --> 731.839
that sometimes

719.44 --> 731.839
i'm pretty sure that he is a smart guy

734.93 --> 737.9899999999999
[Music]

738.24 --> 741.76
right yeah you don't have to overblow it

740.88 --> 744.639
the other way

741.76 --> 746.8
it's just people they're all people

744.639 --> 748.48
these people all have egos and they have

746.8 --> 752.88
their issues they have their

748.48 --> 756.639
personal background impulses

752.88 --> 760.959
and yeah

756.639 --> 764.16
to just people flat earthers are not

760.959 --> 767.5189999999999
child abusers they never are

764.16 --> 771.36
all they ever want is for children to be

767.519 --> 772.0
strong and smart and attain the personal

771.36 --> 775.2
ability

772.0 --> 776.24
to prevent being fooled by delusions out

775.2 --> 778.5600000000001
there

776.24 --> 779.6800000000001
that's what flat earthers really want

778.56 --> 783.76
now some of them

779.68 --> 787.1999999999999
might oversimplify that conception

783.76 --> 789.76
and yeah almost act like churchians like

787.2 --> 792.1600000000001
just constantly flat earth flatters flat

789.76 --> 794.48
earth in the simplest way

792.16 --> 796.16
and maybe get even a little bit pissed

794.48 --> 801.839
off when others don't get it

796.16 --> 801.8389999999999
but that's personal flaws

802.399 --> 808.72
you won't see any really creepy behavior

805.68 --> 812.399
from flat earthers towards normies

808.72 --> 815.76
why would we it's ridiculous it's

812.399 --> 817.76
kind of known by now anyway that most of

815.76 --> 820.399
the time the norm is just rejected

817.76 --> 820.959
it just takes time and if you're just

820.399 --> 823.199
gonna

820.959 --> 825.1199999999999
push it harder when they don't want to

823.199 --> 825.92
accept it it's going to have a more

825.12 --> 828.32
negative

825.92 --> 830.24
reaction as a response and most of us

828.32 --> 833.44
know that by now

830.24 --> 835.279
so only time we might some of us might

833.44 --> 838.399
get a little nasty is against

835.279 --> 841.279
really nasty trolls against

838.399 --> 842.079
the ballers that are kind of more

841.279 --> 844.56
blatantly

842.079 --> 844.56
lying

846.88 --> 850.639
that gets us pissed off but that's not

848.959 --> 853.1199999999999
children

850.639 --> 854.72
children don't do that they can't do

853.12 --> 857.839
that they don't have they don't get it

854.72 --> 857.839
enough to do that

859.66 --> 862.809
[Music]

875.36 --> 884.88
right anyway yeah that was it for the

878.32 --> 887.6800000000001
notes i didn't make a lot of notes

884.88 --> 887.68
watch anything

896.839 --> 899.839
hmm

901.25 --> 904.419
[Music]

917.76 --> 923.6
oh daniel pratt got deleted oh

921.199 --> 924.8
look daniel pratt man he's been around

923.6 --> 928.399
for a long time but

924.8 --> 931.199
he's a total flap out

928.399 --> 932.079
like i don't know some people might

931.199 --> 934.959
consider him

932.079 --> 937.12
a nice guy deep inside or something but

934.959 --> 941.04
he just says really stupid things

937.12 --> 941.04
so he's not really a guy that i

941.44 --> 947.519
consider a reliable indiv

944.88 --> 949.279
but yeah i don't know him too well but

947.519 --> 955.839
he said a lot of stupid things

949.279 --> 955.8389999999999
on his channel

957.279 --> 960.639
while stupid things like br yeah like

960.079 --> 968.68
over the

960.639 --> 971.86
overkill blind accusations

968.68 --> 971.8599999999999
[Music]

976.48 --> 981.04
it's it comes down to this it's very

978.8 --> 982.0
basic how it really works that mechanism

981.04 --> 985.5999999999999
that mistake

982.0 --> 988.24
it is that you bump into people you deal

985.6 --> 990.5600000000001
with they're very annoying they're liars

988.24 --> 992.72
and then you figure out you get a feel

990.56 --> 993.92
of certain things they do and it seems

992.72 --> 997.519
kind of creepy they have

993.92 --> 1000.24
creepy traits to them now you could

997.519 --> 1000.72
remotely conclude that that white paper

1000.24 --> 1004.0
caused

1000.72 --> 1006.399
like a pedophile or a creep psychopath

1004.0 --> 1010.639
blah blah blah

1006.399 --> 1012.639
or or you could simply realize wait

1010.639 --> 1014.48
maybe that's just something that i'm

1012.639 --> 1016.0790000000001
making of it that's kind of overblown

1014.48 --> 1018.16
maybe i should just

1016.079 --> 1019.199
say it how it is like they have these

1018.16 --> 1021.92
creepy traits

1019.199 --> 1022.4799999999999
it reminds me of creepy people doesn't

1021.92 --> 1025.839
mean they

1022.48 --> 1027.76
are that's a much more

1025.839 --> 1029.4389999999999
better way to basically express that

1027.76 --> 1031.76
sort of things because

1029.439 --> 1033.6000000000001
it's just blindly accusing people of

1031.76 --> 1036.48
being

1033.6 --> 1038.24
yeah very [ __ ] up like criminally

1036.48 --> 1053.84
[ __ ] up it's just

1038.24 --> 1053.84
it's no good doesn't do anyone any good

1064.84 --> 1067.84
uh

1072.4 --> 1081.8400000000001
what's this no

1106.84 --> 1109.84
okay

1111.28 --> 1113.6
right

1115.12 --> 1121.12
but manuel why why are you asking this

1119.36 --> 1124.24
is again one of the

1121.12 --> 1125.84
like you come in and then first ask a

1124.24 --> 1127.84
question like that that makes me think

1125.84 --> 1130.3999999999999
you're a troll

1127.84 --> 1130.3999999999999
just saying

1131.2 --> 1136.4
because how is that important to

1134.84 --> 1139.6
anything

1136.4 --> 1141.44
do i have backups i have backups of all

1139.6 --> 1143.4399999999998
my flat earth talks

1141.44 --> 1145.039
and i got backups of some of the flat

1143.44 --> 1147.2
earth early birds but not all of them

1145.039 --> 1150.72
because i got way too much

1147.2 --> 1153.3600000000001
i i i don't have the capability at the

1150.72 --> 1155.76
moment to even store all that

1153.36 --> 1158.24
i don't have the right programs like if

1155.76 --> 1162.559
i had to do it manually

1158.24 --> 1164.64
it would literally take me two days

1162.559 --> 1166.08
and all kinds of things constantly go

1164.64 --> 1167.2
wrong with the freaking downloads as

1166.08 --> 1171.76
well

1167.2 --> 1173.6000000000001
so yeah i've considered even getting

1171.76 --> 1175.84
like a youtube plus account

1173.6 --> 1178.08
because apparently it also gives you

1175.84 --> 1179.6789999999999
access to an easy downloader for the

1178.08 --> 1181.9189999999999
videos

1179.679 --> 1183.679
and that way i might be able to download

1181.919 --> 1186.5590000000002
it all

1183.679 --> 1186.5590000000002
but then again

1187.679 --> 1192.72
like is it that essential

1190.799 --> 1195.84
oh man yeah it would be kind of a waste

1192.72 --> 1195.84
if it was all gone but

1197.2 --> 1201.44
i mean most of what i've done i could

1199.679 --> 1204.48
literally just

1201.44 --> 1221.8400000000001
recreate it i could just redo a lot of

1204.48 --> 1221.84
it i remember most of what i've done

1232.84 --> 1235.84
so

1236.24 --> 1239.349
[Music]

1239.84 --> 1245.039
tubermate app an app well i don't use

1242.96 --> 1247.44
apps i don't have a phone remember i

1245.039 --> 1248.0
don't have internet phone so whatever

1247.44 --> 1249.919
you think

1248.0 --> 1251.919
makes it so easy for you because you're

1249.919 --> 1253.76
always using that freaking phone

1251.919 --> 1256.72
to do everything yeah that's probably

1253.76 --> 1256.72
not gonna work for me

1258.96 --> 1266.08
but yeah if you guys

1262.08 --> 1269.36
could help me out for real

1266.08 --> 1272.6399999999999
contact me on skype about it and hey if

1269.36 --> 1275.84
somebody has the ability to basically

1272.64 --> 1279.44
download my entire

1275.84 --> 1282.48
videography say all the flatter

1279.44 --> 1283.039
all the flat earth early bird shows all

1282.48 --> 1286.559
of them

1283.039 --> 1286.559
if you can't do that somehow

1287.2 --> 1291.039
quickly and not that my computer would

1289.6 --> 1295.84
have to be busy within an

1291.039 --> 1295.84
entire day then i'm all up for it

1298.08 --> 1302.1589999999999
every app is software and usable on pcs

1300.799 --> 1319.84
not true

1302.159 --> 1319.8400000000001
it's not true they don't always work

1320.76 --> 1325.76
397 hours of video well that wouldn't be

1323.6 --> 1327.84
enough

1325.76 --> 1329.44
yeah and it's more remember because my

1327.84 --> 1332.799
weekend shows

1329.44 --> 1335.2
are all one and a half hour most of them

1332.799 --> 1336.08
i've skipped a couple of shows only but

1335.2 --> 1338.559
i've also had

1336.08 --> 1347.84
extra long shows so it would be more in

1338.559 --> 1347.84
the direction of 800 hours i think

1353.52 --> 1361.84
oh diddy now

1380.559 --> 1386.24
right anyway yeah i i would be up for

1383.6 --> 1389.12
some assistance to

1386.24 --> 1389.6
to be able to download everything i pre

1389.12 --> 1391.76
i

1389.6 --> 1393.52
probably do have enough room on my hard

1391.76 --> 1395.2
disk to get it all

1393.52 --> 1397.679
it's just that the programs that i've

1395.2 --> 1399.2
been using for it all broke down at some

1397.679 --> 1400.0
point they literally just stopped

1399.2 --> 1403.8400000000001
working

1400.0 --> 1403.84
even when i reinstalled it very annoying

1406.12 --> 1409.2399999999998
[Music]

1411.44 --> 1417.679
store in low definition

1414.84 --> 1421.1999999999998
yeah well look

1417.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
as long as the text in these in the chat

1421.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
is readable then everything is fine

1432.159 --> 1438.159
ah air has mass and weight yeah yeah

1435.679 --> 1439.6000000000001
yeah and ball that that's nice but it

1438.159 --> 1443.6000000000001
only had does so

1439.6 --> 1459.84
in a container but you probably got him

1443.6 --> 1459.84
at a touchy point

1470.159 --> 1475.1200000000001
360 or better to read that font well i'd

1473.2 --> 1477.3600000000001
prefer it to be a little bit bigger than

1475.12 --> 1477.36
that

1478.08 --> 1483.36
i'd say format of what is it

1484.24 --> 1489.76
what like 720 720 is a good format

1498.84 --> 1501.84
exactly

1512.64 --> 1521.4
right anyway

1515.8 --> 1521.3999999999999
[Music]

1535.919 --> 1542.72
multiple drives no

1539.2 --> 1546.32
no you don't 720 videos

1542.72 --> 1546.32
don't take up that much space

1546.88 --> 1557.5200000000002
let me see

1556.08 --> 1559.6789999999999
zip file them well it wouldn't even

1557.52 --> 1563.52
necessarily be

1559.679 --> 1563.52
they wouldn't even be necessary i think

1568.84 --> 1571.84
okay

1578.72 --> 1586.48
all right okay

1584.24 --> 1586.48
uh

1589.44 --> 1592.48
let me find one

1594.48 --> 1601.039
yeah it's like 271

1598.039 --> 1601.039
250

1602.88 --> 1608.0800000000002
what's this oh wait no no those are

1607.12 --> 1611.279
special

1608.08 --> 1611.279
recordings hold on

1611.36 --> 1616.24
where is it another early bird yeah i

1613.919 --> 1619.76
already got some stored

1616.24 --> 1622.64
so let's just say episode

1619.76 --> 1622.64
63

1622.799 --> 1627.84
is 360 megabytes

1631.039 --> 1641.92
so how much storage space do i have left

1641.36 --> 1644.9789999999998
okay

1641.92 --> 1644.979
[Music]

1651.12 --> 1657.279
right i've i've only got one and a half

1654.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
terabytes free so i think i'll

1657.279 --> 1669.84
be able to manage

1669.919 --> 1677.5200000000002
right i could technically fit 3

1673.44 --> 1683.8400000000001
000 more episodes on my computer roughly

1677.52 --> 1683.84
so it'll work

1685.919 --> 1689.5200000000002
yeah a hot day movie right but that's a

1688.48 --> 1697.84
movie in that

1689.52 --> 1697.84
like full movie

1698.559 --> 1703.44
my shows are visually not that

1700.96 --> 1706.159
spectacular anyway

1703.44 --> 1709.3600000000001
so it doesn't matter it'll be alright it

1706.159 --> 1712.24
fits i don't need anything extra

1709.36 --> 1714.08
what i do need extra is is financial

1712.24 --> 1715.039
support that's what i need extra that's

1714.08 --> 1718.399
it

1715.039 --> 1720.32
and hey if people are doing well and i'm

1718.399 --> 1722.0
getting a lot of surplus who knows i

1720.32 --> 1724.559
might be able to

1722.0 --> 1726.159
get something extra unless everybody

1724.559 --> 1728.8799999999999
here insists that i get an

1726.159 --> 1730.0800000000002
extra hard disk which i technically

1728.88 --> 1732.3200000000002
wouldn't mind

1730.08 --> 1739.84
could use extra storage space but i

1732.32 --> 1739.84
don't need it right now

1745.63 --> 1749.3590000000002
[Music]

1754.24 --> 1760.559
two terabyte external solid status

1758.08 --> 1760.559
hello

1761.44 --> 1765.6000000000001
yeah solid state disks are freaking

1763.84 --> 1769.039
expensive

1765.6 --> 1770.7199999999998
still so even though i wouldn't mind

1769.039 --> 1773.919
having a huge one

1770.72 --> 1777.6000000000001
it's just insanely expensive

1773.919 --> 1778.64
oh only less than two oh well that is

1777.6 --> 1781.84
all

1778.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
just too unreal

1782.08 --> 1798.849
yeah that's very nice

1794.38 --> 1798.8490000000002
[Music]

1802.64 --> 1809.8400000000001
on an op drive

1815.6 --> 1823.84
operating system no but this is my

1817.6 --> 1823.84
storage disk

1833.12 --> 1836.9599999999998
okay well that's very nice that's that's

1835.6 --> 1851.84
great that you don't know

1836.96 --> 1851.8400000000001
anyone i do me

1856.64 --> 1859.669
[Music]

1870.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
right but i i got a solid state drive

1874.24 --> 1879.84
as my uh yeah my base computer

1879.919 --> 1885.76
because it's so much faster

1883.12 --> 1887.6
but i do still have a big hard disk for

1885.76 --> 1889.84
larger storage because i'm not all going

1887.6 --> 1893.6789999999999
to dump that on a solid state drive it's

1889.84 --> 1893.6789999999999
just a waste that's a waste of its

1904.84 --> 1907.84
capability

1917.36 --> 1923.76
ssd very fast but expensive relatively

1921.279 --> 1925.76
yeah tiny wombo but of course getting

1923.76 --> 1929.2
more cheap

1925.76 --> 1932.24
but also yeah there's just

1929.2 --> 1934.3990000000001
easier you don't have to do everything

1932.24 --> 1936.96
on one single freaking disk

1934.399 --> 1938.32
when you have a desktop computer you

1936.96 --> 1941.279
know

1938.32 --> 1942.799
so i use a solid straight state drive

1941.279 --> 1944.399
for

1942.799 --> 1947.039
the installation pretty much for

1944.399 --> 1949.279
everything that's installed

1947.039 --> 1950.72
and then i have a separate disk for

1949.279 --> 1954.159
standard storage

1950.72 --> 1955.44
for all the the file backups even of the

1954.159 --> 1957.519
programs

1955.44 --> 1959.519
so i literally split up my computer and

1957.519 --> 1962.64
it always works i've done this for

1959.519 --> 1964.48
20 years it works great great great

1962.64 --> 1967.039
great

1964.48 --> 1968.48
i still have data that's like 20 years

1967.039 --> 1970.8799999999999
old

1968.48 --> 1971.519
that's basically stored because every

1970.88 --> 1973.679
time

1971.519 --> 1976.159
i get a new computer completely new

1973.679 --> 1979.6000000000001
installation i take the old

1976.159 --> 1982.5590000000002
content then put it in a separate

1979.6 --> 1985.039
folder and then put that entire folder

1982.559 --> 1988.48
on the storage

1985.039 --> 1992.0
and then after period i usually just

1988.48 --> 1993.3600000000001
snip it away i throw things away there

1992.0 --> 1997.039
double i

1993.36 --> 1999.6
reorder it i assimilate it in the new

1997.039 --> 1999.6
storage

2003.519 --> 2021.679
that's how i do it it works great

2018.0 --> 2026.399
a music map from 1992. yeah yeah me too

2021.679 --> 2026.3990000000001
well not that old but very old

2026.48 --> 2029.679
i got like a uh what is it like an

2028.72 --> 2032.96
interactive

2029.679 --> 2035.2
player what's it called again

2032.96 --> 2038.72
those are that's like in the 90s what's

2035.2 --> 2038.72
the name again of those things

2040.48 --> 2043.679
see if i can find it

2043.76 --> 2048.24
oh wait it should be in in a music file

2055.2 --> 2061.839
mods yeah mod plug i got mod plug

2069.76 --> 2078.159
modplug and a lot of yeah mod

2073.839 --> 2078.159
songs and that's like complete songs

2078.48 --> 2089.839
wait where is it where are my modplugs

2100.839 --> 2105.119
hmm

2102.0 --> 2107.76
okay it's a little weird i can't find it

2105.119 --> 2108.96
i can't find the songs but yeah that i

2107.76 --> 2111.6800000000003
had so many like

2108.96 --> 2113.68
goat trends and all kinds of trans type

2111.68 --> 2115.52
songs on there that were like

2113.68 --> 2118.48
the funny thing about that player is is

2115.52 --> 2118.48
it's like a live

2118.56 --> 2125.119
interpreter because the songs are like

2121.68 --> 2128.0
they're not a sound file

2125.119 --> 2128.8
they're basically like a like a music

2128.0 --> 2132.24
program

2128.8 --> 2134.1600000000003
file designating special sound effects

2132.24 --> 2135.52
and everything and arranging that

2134.16 --> 2138.96
program and then the mod

2135.52 --> 2143.04
player like plays it

2138.96 --> 2145.28
live and it's not just midi files

2145.28 --> 2153.2000000000003
oh right and wait from amiga 500 ha

2149.76 --> 2155.6800000000003
wow i wish i had some of that

2153.2 --> 2158.72
i had an amiga 1200 and had some of the

2155.68 --> 2161.52
best music i've ever heard on computers

2158.72 --> 2161.52
back in that time

2162.079 --> 2172.28
it's such great sound effects that still

2165.52 --> 2175.399
carry weight to this day

2172.28 --> 2175.3990000000003
[Music]

2187.76 --> 2195.0400000000004
xm audio file

2191.44 --> 2198.4
right and this song here

2195.04 --> 2198.4
which is very long

2198.48 --> 2204.64
is only 1.7 megabytes

2201.52 --> 2208.0
and that's a song that's like 10 minutes

2204.64 --> 2210.24
and it's great quality so yeah mod plug

2208.0 --> 2211.28
very interesting system for that but

2210.24 --> 2215.839
it's old

2211.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
it's not really used anymore

2222.88 --> 2229.28
but yeah mud plug for me it seemed

2225.92 --> 2232.64
very much like what the commodore 64 was

2229.28 --> 2233.599
but with music commodore 64 had like

2232.64 --> 2236.0789999999997
this

2233.599 --> 2237.119
these chipsets it basically was a

2236.079 --> 2238.88
computer that

2237.119 --> 2240.839
had certain limits but then the

2238.88 --> 2242.1600000000003
programmers figured out to how to

2240.839 --> 2245.119
basically

2242.16 --> 2246.3999999999996
squeeze as much possible out of what the

2245.119 --> 2248.0
computer could do and then

2246.4 --> 2250.1600000000003
turned out that they could do a whole

2248.0 --> 2251.839
lot more than the original designers had

2250.16 --> 2255.359
even

2251.839 --> 2258.48
thought that it could do well modplug

2255.359 --> 2261.44
is kind of like that in music

2258.48 --> 2264.96
generators and it would turn out to do

2261.44 --> 2267.04
quite miraculous things

2264.96 --> 2268.64
there's been some pretty incredible

2267.04 --> 2269.119
songs that have been made with that that

2268.64 --> 2274.48
are just

2269.119 --> 2277.52
they have surreal level sound effects

2274.48 --> 2285.839
in files that are not even two megabytes

2277.52 --> 2285.839
it's crazy

2296.839 --> 2301.599
so

2298.8 --> 2302.96
right well marco box how they did it is

2301.599 --> 2305.92
basically to step

2302.96 --> 2308.2400000000002
back the music designing process and

2305.92 --> 2311.6800000000003
keep it in the director's room

2308.24 --> 2315.68
so mod player is like a director's

2311.68 --> 2316.0789999999997
room player it's not the final music

2315.68 --> 2318.24
song

2316.079 --> 2320.4
product that is recorded as a sound file

2318.24 --> 2323.7599999999998
but it's still

2320.4 --> 2326.7200000000003
being directed and then live played

2323.76 --> 2329.28
by that system by the mud player by the

2326.72 --> 2329.2799999999997
mud block

2330.16 --> 2333.92
and yeah that way it's pretty incredible

2332.64 --> 2337.7599999999998
what you could do with it because

2333.92 --> 2340.8
just having sound files is just very raw

2337.76 --> 2344.7200000000003
detailed data and that

2340.8 --> 2344.7200000000003
often takes up just a lot more space

2346.24 --> 2349.5989999999997
very similar to midi yeah it was the

2348.24 --> 2353.7599999999998
basic it

2349.599 --> 2355.6800000000003
it's from the same build up

2353.76 --> 2357.76
it is kind of like media except it

2355.68 --> 2360.48
doesn't have horrific

2357.76 --> 2362.6400000000003
shitty sound effects that we all hate

2360.48 --> 2369.839
well i do at least

2362.64 --> 2369.839
this thing is is much more elaborate

2370.34 --> 2375.9590000000003
[Music]

2380.0 --> 2383.119
well i guess we're talking computers

2381.839 --> 2397.839
today

2383.119 --> 2397.839
on this short hangout

2410.56 --> 2412.88
all right

2417.13 --> 2421.04
[Music]

2419.119 --> 2422.6400000000003
some computer stuff hey everything has a

2421.04 --> 2426.079
time and a place you know and i

2422.64 --> 2428.16
i was i'm not really too i didn't i do i

2426.079 --> 2430.2400000000002
feel a little bit sickish today not

2428.16 --> 2431.52
sick sick it's just that i'm sweating a

2430.24 --> 2434.72
lot and

2431.52 --> 2436.079
yeah i don't know i had issues with my

2434.72 --> 2439.2
jaw again last night

2436.079 --> 2441.599
it was very annoying and i do feel a

2439.2 --> 2446.56
little better now

2441.599 --> 2453.839
it's just today i'm not in the best of

2446.56 --> 2453.839
energies doing right though

2462.079 --> 2467.119
right note information and then the

2465.04 --> 2468.4
sound effects database has to be

2467.119 --> 2470.88
provided

2468.4 --> 2473.28
so it gives you a code that code taps

2470.88 --> 2475.6800000000003
into a sound system that should be part

2473.28 --> 2478.8
of the computer

2475.68 --> 2480.16
manipulates it a little maybe puts it in

2478.8 --> 2482.7200000000003
order and then that

2480.16 --> 2483.92
interactively plays out that's right

2482.72 --> 2488.24
that's how that works

2483.92 --> 2492.839
you got it well modplug does that too

2488.24 --> 2494.9599999999996
and it provides it provides the sound

2492.839 --> 2498.0789999999997
spectrum

2494.96 --> 2498.56
so it's basically just a small very

2498.079 --> 2500.48
small

2498.56 --> 2502.48
simple it it's so simple that's the

2500.48 --> 2505.28
magnificence of it provides a small

2502.48 --> 2508.8
database of sound effects

2505.28 --> 2512.8
so yeah mechanism and then

2508.8 --> 2515.28
yeah the the songs would have to have

2512.8 --> 2516.88
utilized that specific program so all

2515.28 --> 2520.48
these songs that i have were made

2516.88 --> 2523.359
specifically for modplug

2520.48 --> 2523.839
and yeah this is just a small grab of

2523.359 --> 2526.48
what i

2523.839 --> 2530.24
had because way back then and i'm

2526.48 --> 2533.92
talking early 2000s

2530.24 --> 2537.359
there the internet the internet

2533.92 --> 2539.04
was full of these songs my brother was

2537.359 --> 2540.48
really into it at first like we were

2539.04 --> 2542.319
even like discussing

2540.48 --> 2543.68
we're gonna bring out cds of these guys

2542.319 --> 2544.64
because they have really good songs and

2543.68 --> 2546.96
it's kind of like

2544.64 --> 2548.72
in in a vacuum out there then nobody

2546.96 --> 2551.44
really even knows about it except people

2548.72 --> 2554.0789999999997
that really loved that sony music

2551.44 --> 2555.839
and then we were like reviewing songs

2554.079 --> 2558.8
and i started to do it too

2555.839 --> 2559.359
because there were like thousands of

2558.8 --> 2562.6400000000003
them

2559.359 --> 2565.7599999999998
thousands of songs people made just

2562.64 --> 2566.8799999999997
on one spot thousands of songs crazy

2565.76 --> 2569.8390000000004
amounts

2566.88 --> 2570.8
and yeah even crappy ones too by the way

2569.839 --> 2572.7999999999997
but there was still

2570.8 --> 2574.319
a huge amount of really good songs that

2572.8 --> 2577.44
i ended up

2574.319 --> 2581.119
collecting like 200 of them

2577.44 --> 2583.52
200 pretty decent songs and then like 20

2581.119 --> 2593.28
which were my favorites like that

2583.52 --> 2596.0
it's something that happened back then

2593.28 --> 2597.8390000000004
still make tracks sometimes huh cool

2596.0 --> 2601.92
i've never really made any

2597.839 --> 2606.0
myself i'm

2601.92 --> 2608.8
yeah i enjoy music i'm i'm a fine taster

2606.0 --> 2609.76
in music if i say so myself instead of

2608.8 --> 2612.96
wine i taste

2609.76 --> 2614.3190000000004
music and i come from i have the talents

2612.96 --> 2617.839
i come from a

2614.319 --> 2619.68
super talented music family

2617.839 --> 2621.119
that have the brains for it especially

2619.68 --> 2624.24
my mother did

2621.119 --> 2627.6800000000003
my father too and

2624.24 --> 2627.68
but i've never really

2630.0 --> 2637.599
wanted to really make music

2633.599 --> 2640.88
design music myself i'd rather

2637.599 --> 2642.96
direct others to make it

2640.88 --> 2644.319
like can you do something like this can

2642.96 --> 2646.88
you have these sound effects

2644.319 --> 2647.52
like i would give them the like what i

2646.88 --> 2649.599
would want

2647.52 --> 2650.72
and i'd hope that they'd make something

2649.599 --> 2653.28
good

2650.72 --> 2654.56
because if i'd have to literally from

2653.28 --> 2658.2400000000002
scratch do the music

2654.56 --> 2660.24
myself i'd be too self-conscious

2658.24 --> 2662.16
it would be to me almost like learning

2660.24 --> 2663.68
how to talk all over again i've

2662.16 --> 2665.68
literally never engaged i've always

2663.68 --> 2669.1189999999997
decided no i'm going to

2665.68 --> 2672.0789999999997
specialize in talking my

2669.119 --> 2674.079
bardic skill my music spill skill is

2672.079 --> 2676.96
going to be speech and explanation and

2674.079 --> 2679.6800000000003
i've stuck to that all my life

2676.96 --> 2680.319
but i do enjoy music a lot and i do have

2679.68 --> 2685.04
to say

2680.319 --> 2687.68
things about music i can analyze music

2685.04 --> 2688.839
i feel i am competent enough to judge

2687.68 --> 2691.839
factors of

2688.839 --> 2691.839
music

2692.24 --> 2696.319
what instruments did my parents play

2694.16 --> 2698.0789999999997
well my my dad's been a guitar teacher

2696.319 --> 2700.56
his entire life

2698.079 --> 2702.319
he only quit because he got problems

2700.56 --> 2705.92
with his fingers

2702.319 --> 2708.56
started to hurt so he stopped that

2705.92 --> 2709.44
but he's done that for like 50 years

2708.56 --> 2714.4
since he was

2709.44 --> 2719.76
eight yeah eight he gave guitar lessons

2714.4 --> 2723.119
to other kids when he was eight

2719.76 --> 2723.92
right uh and my mother well my mother

2723.119 --> 2727.44
was much more an

2723.92 --> 2730.319
all-round woman but she was very much

2727.44 --> 2732.16
into piano she's pretty good at piano

2730.319 --> 2734.72
she composed on her piano

2732.16 --> 2736.8799999999997
too i was privy to hear that as a kid

2734.72 --> 2738.7999999999997
it's very special to be around

2736.88 --> 2740.48
listening to how she was composing

2738.8 --> 2744.079
classical music

2740.48 --> 2748.0
and jazz classical jazz

2744.079 --> 2752.1600000000003
either one typically uh

2748.0 --> 2755.68
but we also played the flute

2752.16 --> 2757.2
regular flute uh my mother did too and

2755.68 --> 2760.0789999999997
some of her songs were composed

2757.2 --> 2762.0789999999997
specifically for it she composed music

2760.079 --> 2764.2400000000002
that we then as a family would be

2762.079 --> 2766.8
playing

2764.24 --> 2767.839
it was pretty special and by the way

2766.8 --> 2770.96
those songs

2767.839 --> 2772.0789999999997
that were played with the flute they're

2770.96 --> 2775.839
on my channel

2772.079 --> 2775.8390000000004
except there it played in guitar

2776.24 --> 2780.24
and that's like my music my mother's

2778.8 --> 2782.7200000000003
music that's that

2780.24 --> 2785.2799999999997
playlist file that was mute literally

2782.72 --> 2787.9199999999996
that's music my mother composed

2785.28 --> 2788.3190000000004
and that i played as a kid on my flute

2787.92 --> 2792.16
with

2788.319 --> 2792.16
her and my dad

2794.93 --> 2798.0
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
right

2811.04 --> 2819.04
yeah and this specific

2816.0 --> 2820.8
these songs specifically are i think

2819.04 --> 2823.92
one of my mother's best compositions

2820.8 --> 2826.1600000000003
she's she's also made other stuff

2823.92 --> 2827.839
didn't like us that much it has much it

2826.16 --> 2831.359
was too

2827.839 --> 2836.0
kooky too much like her too personal

2831.359 --> 2838.0789999999997
and ugh she just had very annoying

2836.0 --> 2840.079
things that i think were annoying

2838.079 --> 2842.4
because it's my mother

2840.079 --> 2844.559
and in retrospect it seems kind of

2842.4 --> 2846.64
annoyingly liberal in ways

2844.559 --> 2848.96
that just i don't appreciate that

2846.64 --> 2852.16
anymore back then it was like oh mom

2848.96 --> 2859.839
being all liberal and now it's like

2852.16 --> 2859.839
but yeah she's not around anymore so

2860.559 --> 2867.2000000000003
but music was always there and

2864.4 --> 2867.92
like my parents even played like in a

2867.2 --> 2873.359
guitar

2867.92 --> 2876.4
band like in a garage band sort of thing

2873.359 --> 2878.96
funk music yeah they were also a lot

2876.4 --> 2878.96
into funk

2879.44 --> 2883.44
funk jazz and classic

2885.599 --> 2890.079
