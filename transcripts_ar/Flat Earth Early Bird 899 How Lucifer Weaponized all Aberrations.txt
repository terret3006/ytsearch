168.0 --> 171.44
although i haven't had a lot of trouble

169.92 --> 175.04
with that

171.44 --> 178.4
recently but yeah it goes

175.04 --> 181.67999999999998
with swing of the pendulum up and down

178.4 --> 183.84
sometimes it's just like oh massive down

181.68 --> 185.44
void piling

183.84 --> 188.4
system doesn't work people get

185.44 --> 188.4
unsubscribed

188.56 --> 193.04
without knowing all that weird stuff

191.36 --> 196.0
it's been happening since the beginning

193.04 --> 196.0
of my channel really

196.84 --> 205.12
uh hello cameron kamikaze gilmore

200.159 --> 205.12
good morning to you dean white right

207.28 --> 213.04
huh five and a half hour video holy [ __ ]

211.599 --> 217.83999999999997
dude

213.04 --> 217.84
sheesh okay

219.2 --> 223.11999999999998
that's a long freaking video

223.68 --> 229.68
interesting interesting concerning like

227.04 --> 232.56
the subject title of the show today that

229.68 --> 236.0
i gave it yesterday night

232.56 --> 236.0
hello seeking star wars

238.879 --> 242.0
foot of snow phil

244.319 --> 249.439
montana it's cold all right

252.84 --> 257.44
right so

254.48 --> 259.12
yeah my uh his hair is looking less than

257.44 --> 261.44
optimal it's because

259.12 --> 262.639
somebody decided to go into a shower

261.44 --> 264.96
right there

262.639 --> 266.08
right before the show started it's just

264.96 --> 269.59999999999997
just like oh

266.08 --> 271.68
okay great

269.6 --> 275.6
and i was on the toilet downstairs so i

271.68 --> 275.6
couldn't like rush in and say like wait

275.759 --> 283.84000000000003
ah goody all right

289.68 --> 293.199
i've seen worse hair days

293.28 --> 300.55999999999995
like with the amsterdam conference

297.52 --> 300.56
after the first day

303.52 --> 306.0
anyway

308.32 --> 315.52
yeah i got up kind of late like uh

311.919 --> 317.52
a quarter past 12 because i did have

315.52 --> 320.15999999999997
kind of a late night last night also

317.52 --> 322.639
just i think i needed a lot of sleep

320.16 --> 324.0
had a good sleep you know part of the

322.639 --> 327.36
reason is that

324.0 --> 329.759
in the mornings when i do

327.36 --> 333.28000000000003
wake up the first time always happens

329.759 --> 335.84000000000003
kind of a couple of hours before

333.28 --> 338.71999999999997
especially when i had a i had a decent

335.84 --> 342.479
dose of magnesium last night

338.72 --> 346.32000000000005
it like the morning rest is really

342.479 --> 350.0
great but then sometimes yeah

346.32 --> 350.0
i get up a little late because of it

350.8 --> 353.84000000000003
i feel good

354.08 --> 358.4
lots of dreams in all directions

360.08 --> 364.15999999999997
also yeah i've definitely been thinking

362.24 --> 367.84000000000003
about yesterday's show

364.16 --> 367.84000000000003
i'm really interested to hear

368.08 --> 374.479
more feedback from you guys because

371.28 --> 376.0
as i rolled it out i i did get kind of

374.479 --> 379.28
the right response that i

376.0 --> 379.68
hoped for but i thought like have you

379.28 --> 382.08
guys

379.68 --> 382.8
thought about it too and kind of let it

382.08 --> 385.039
sink

382.8 --> 387.919
and then cross-reference it with

385.039 --> 387.919
everything out there

390.479 --> 395.919
did anybody do it

393.6 --> 398.0
because i'm really interested in deeper

395.919 --> 401.75899999999996
thoughts i also asked

398.0 --> 401.759
the flat earth debate panelists

401.84 --> 407.19899999999996
like after the recording ended also like

405.199 --> 410.40000000000003
yeah i'm really interested in hearing

407.199 --> 410.40000000000003
your opinion about this

414.96 --> 419.52
in a way like i am a bit nervous about

417.44 --> 423.84
it right because it is

419.52 --> 423.84
quite a controversial stand to make

424.639 --> 429.919
to say that jesus never died

427.919 --> 431.35999999999996
because of yeah just look what happens

429.919 --> 437.84
when you tell this to

431.36 --> 437.84000000000003
a regular conditioned christian

440.319 --> 443.52000000000004
yeah but george sanford see now you're

442.639 --> 446.72
taking

443.52 --> 450.0
that's i know i know you have

446.72 --> 454.47900000000004
yeah but you took it you

450.0 --> 454.479
took one turn too many

455.36 --> 464.40000000000003
right i think that sun in the

460.08 --> 467.19899999999996
in the celestial cosmology symbolism

464.4 --> 469.35999999999996
definitely synchronizes up with jesus

467.199 --> 472.0
right and it's even like the layout

469.36 --> 474.0
of things in the bible yeah that

472.0 --> 477.199
suggestion is heavily there

474.0 --> 478.879
doesn't exclude him from actually being

477.199 --> 480.24
the other things though that that's the

478.879 --> 482.56
whole thing that i

480.24 --> 484.40000000000003
i've been trying to make this point for

482.56 --> 487.599
years now

484.4 --> 491.44
bible is a multi-dimensional book it's

487.599 --> 495.44
all true right but

491.44 --> 498.71999999999997
you have to understand it because

495.44 --> 500.639
there are things and sayings aberrations

498.72 --> 502.56
that's that's definitely what they are

500.639 --> 507.199
aberrations

502.56 --> 510.24
conclusions that are kind of inserted

507.199 --> 511.12
natural conclusions people would come to

510.24 --> 513.039
because there's

511.12 --> 514.64
endless amounts of conclusions people

513.039 --> 518.8389999999999
can come to from all different

514.64 --> 520.399
angles reading it but these types of

518.839 --> 524.9590000000001
interpretations

520.399 --> 528.72
have been identified

524.959 --> 531.92
and a spell created to kind of

528.72 --> 535.279
bind them in a bigger way but this is

531.92 --> 538.88
is feels artificial every time people

535.279 --> 541.279
chant these very specific things

538.88 --> 542.959
they're just chanting because when you

541.279 --> 546.24
inquire

542.959 --> 548.64
exactly like if you

546.24 --> 549.76
ask them to test it to lay down the

548.64 --> 551.76
structure

549.76 --> 553.2
to basically prove their claim in that

551.76 --> 559.04
sort of fashion

553.2 --> 560.88
then they they yeah they get agitated

559.04 --> 563.12
it's like you're chanting something you

560.88 --> 565.8389999999999
don't actually understand

563.12 --> 568.0
you learned it by heart you've been

565.839 --> 572.08
conditioned with how important it is

568.0 --> 572.08
but you don't actually understand it

574.839 --> 577.839
really

579.04 --> 584.7199999999999
and this is lucifer's doing

582.16 --> 587.519
right lucifer the one that's always

584.72 --> 590.72
trying to be steps ahead of things

587.519 --> 594.399
and then over

590.72 --> 598.0
like try to undo natural power

594.399 --> 599.76
of ascension by creating spells

598.0 --> 602.399
aberrations

599.76 --> 603.2
emphasizing them weaponizing them so

602.399 --> 605.68
that people

603.2 --> 608.32
are basically tricked into holding on to

605.68 --> 611.76
the aberrations instead of

608.32 --> 614.0790000000001
continuing the ascension process

611.76 --> 615.36
right and this is part of what like the

614.079 --> 620.079
early church

615.36 --> 623.839
typically did they try to contain

620.079 --> 627.1999999999999
the magnificence of christ's teachings

623.839 --> 629.2
by giving an alternative interpretation

627.2 --> 630.32
and a lot of it based on the aberrations

629.2 --> 634.5600000000001
and there's been

630.32 --> 637.6
many more aberrations well admitted

634.56 --> 639.68
that have even been discarded

637.6 --> 641.6800000000001
because they've been figured out even by

639.68 --> 643.1999999999999
the christians that still hold on to

641.68 --> 647.8389999999999
other aberrations

643.2 --> 651.6
right it's it's it's chaos like that

647.839 --> 654.72
and i'm trying to just completely

651.6 --> 658.0790000000001
make it more similar to

654.72 --> 660.24
the scientific inquiry process and just

658.079 --> 663.279
get real

660.24 --> 667.279
to dispel all the aberrations and just

663.279 --> 668.959
move on anyway

667.279 --> 670.64
and in order to do that yeah you have to

668.959 --> 673.5999999999999
test them

670.64 --> 675.04
you have to just say it and it is from

673.6 --> 679.9200000000001
an innocent perspective

675.04 --> 682.16
i am not like ha i'm going to ruin you

679.92 --> 682.959
stupid christians in your stupid

682.16 --> 686.7199999999999
chanting

682.959 --> 690.88
no absolutely not i totally get it

686.72 --> 694.32
it's a pretty high obstacle trick

690.88 --> 695.76
and it's fast and it seeds itself in

694.32 --> 700.32
especially people that

695.76 --> 700.3199999999999
learn a lot about it about the bible the

700.839 --> 703.839
content

714.839 --> 718.0
anyway

716.079 --> 720.4799999999999
yeah dean right yeah the council of

718.0 --> 723.519
nicaea the more i learn about it

720.48 --> 723.519
the less i like it

728.88 --> 736.399
mirrors shadow of the rhythm

732.72 --> 738.8000000000001
maybe seeking star wars maybe

736.399 --> 740.56
it's difficult to say you know jesus's

738.8 --> 744.8
words are still in there and

740.56 --> 747.76
every time i ask like okay

744.8 --> 748.56
what did jesus say about it people even

747.76 --> 750.48
yeah

748.56 --> 752.16
worked with me on that yesterday and

750.48 --> 753.279
brought out a couple of things that he

752.16 --> 756.959
said like about

753.279 --> 760.639
his own resurrection and he said

756.959 --> 764.16
laying down his life now if you insist

760.639 --> 765.44
then you can interpret that as yes that

764.16 --> 768.639
absolutely means he

765.44 --> 772.0
died but since that

768.639 --> 776.72
specific word wasn't actually

772.0 --> 780.079
used then what else can that mean

776.72 --> 782.0
right i look at every saying it's always

780.079 --> 783.4399999999999
like yeah it's all about the context so

782.0 --> 786.72
if you arrive

783.44 --> 788.72
seeking for a specific type of meaning

786.72 --> 790.9590000000001
and then taking it whatever you come

788.72 --> 792.5600000000001
across as soon as you find it

790.959 --> 794.079
then yeah you approach it with your mind

792.56 --> 794.959
made up you're gonna find what you're

794.079 --> 798.16
looking for

794.959 --> 802.079
but if you don't

798.16 --> 806.7199999999999
demand to find like him telling

802.079 --> 811.12
you yeah i died then maybe

806.72 --> 811.12
you can look at this bizarre and

811.279 --> 815.519
extreme situation that jesus went

814.32 --> 817.6
through

815.519 --> 819.12
slightly different and that's basically

817.6 --> 823.1990000000001
the challenge

819.12 --> 823.199
that i'm setting forth with this

826.839 --> 831.9200000000001
conception

828.8 --> 836.16
i don't know george sanford that's no

831.92 --> 839.279
no no jesus definitely

836.16 --> 843.8389999999999
his words his essence the message the

839.279 --> 843.8389999999999
frequency is unmistakable

847.68 --> 852.2399999999999
right as i said you you take you take

850.72 --> 857.839
one corner too many

852.24 --> 857.839
then you end up in the same spot yeah

859.279 --> 862.32
hey but if if that's what you want to

861.04 --> 864.7199999999999
believe then live

862.32 --> 865.839
by that and you will pick the fruits of

864.72 --> 869.1990000000001
that

865.839 --> 871.44
in the meantime i'm going to go with

869.199 --> 873.3599999999999
where the energy is where the right

871.44 --> 877.6
frequencies where the

873.36 --> 877.6
recognition is and

879.279 --> 883.92
by doing that resonating with others

881.76 --> 886.0
that are also ascending in similar

883.92 --> 888.24
fashion

886.0 --> 888.24
right

891.68 --> 895.5999999999999
what you bring is what you find

895.839 --> 899.839
you know them by your by their fruits

905.36 --> 909.839
why do you think jesus wasn't more

907.04 --> 914.639
explicit about the flat earth

909.839 --> 914.639
well did people ask him about it

915.279 --> 921.76
you know from my understanding

919.92 --> 923.76
from what i've heard so far and i have

921.76 --> 924.24
paid attention also to paula you know

923.76 --> 927.68
because

924.24 --> 932.16
yeah she is a great scholar she knows

927.68 --> 935.04
so much doesn't mean she has to

932.16 --> 936.959
yeah be impervious to the traps within

935.04 --> 938.56
but she knows so much and i really

936.959 --> 940.4799999999999
appreciate that and i hope that she

938.56 --> 941.8389999999999
doesn't think that now i'm like after

940.48 --> 944.639
her or something

941.839 --> 946.399
right i'm a little disappointed though

944.639 --> 948.9590000000001
but this is not the first time that

946.399 --> 950.72
something like this happened the past is

948.959 --> 954.399
like twice before it happened

950.72 --> 956.9590000000001
over the years

954.399 --> 959.12
that you would just ban me like that but

956.959 --> 962.0
yeah maybe

959.12 --> 963.12
jesus at a certain point did speak about

962.0 --> 966.079
the flat earth

963.12 --> 967.36
but maybe that happened in his teen

966.079 --> 970.6389999999999
times

967.36 --> 973.04
when he was a teenager where there isn't

970.639 --> 973.6800000000001
a lot about what he was actually talking

973.04 --> 977.199
about

973.68 --> 980.56
and oh my god i can assure you he would

977.199 --> 984.3199999999999
be talking about a lot of [ __ ] back then

980.56 --> 988.16
at that time to

984.32 --> 988.1600000000001
to basically yeah

988.959 --> 992.6389999999999
do what he does but yeah it was left out

991.759 --> 996.16
so

992.639 --> 997.839
my rough estimation is that if he did

996.16 --> 999.36
talk about the flat earth

997.839 --> 1002.8000000000001
he would have done that in his teen

999.36 --> 1007.12
times and it was left out

1002.8 --> 1010.16
right i have to realize also that this

1007.12 --> 1013.92
church system that

1010.16 --> 1017.36
the new yeah the theocracy plan

1013.92 --> 1021.199
that they that's very telling very

1017.36 --> 1021.519
yeah telling it's just very upfront to

1021.199 --> 1023.7589999999999
me

1021.519 --> 1024.64
that they are the ones that were going

1023.759 --> 1027.679
to truly

1024.64 --> 1029.8390000000002
introduce the ball as a religion

1027.679 --> 1031.2800000000002
it's a world religion literally and

1029.839 --> 1035.039
figuratively

1031.28 --> 1039.52
so that they are the ones to actually

1035.039 --> 1042.24
take most of it out

1039.52 --> 1042.8799999999999
but not change it right they they can't

1042.24 --> 1045.76
it

1042.88 --> 1046.7990000000002
replace it with some ball teachings that

1045.76 --> 1049.12
it because that

1046.799 --> 1050.24
is something he wouldn't have said but

1049.12 --> 1054.4799999999998
they can't take out

1050.24 --> 1054.48
the more explicit flat earth things

1054.799 --> 1059.12
and yeah then it remains like okay with

1057.28 --> 1061.28
genesis

1059.12 --> 1064.7199999999998
they probably couldn't figure out a way

1061.28 --> 1067.44
to leave out like the firmament

1064.72 --> 1068.88
because then it would be like a wound

1067.44 --> 1071.919
that would everybody would see

1068.88 --> 1075.6000000000001
like there's something missing here

1071.919 --> 1077.8400000000001
so they just left it in anyway and

1075.6 --> 1079.36
yeah right they can't take away but they

1077.84 --> 1081.52
they can't really insert

1079.36 --> 1083.9189999999999
falsehoods because then the frequency is

1081.52 --> 1083.9189999999999
broken

1085.12 --> 1087.52
anyway

1093.44 --> 1098.88
that's my idea about it hello amanda

1096.559 --> 1098.8799999999999
young

1106.72 --> 1110.88
what the [ __ ] i run if he

1114.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
what are you talking about

1128.64 --> 1132.7990000000002
yes aaron effie jesus said to remember

1131.6 --> 1135.039
his words not what men

1132.799 --> 1137.84
said their interpretation was of his

1135.039 --> 1137.84
worth exactly

1146.72 --> 1151.52
yeah george you're getting on my nerves

1149.76 --> 1153.52
we get the point you don't believe it

1151.52 --> 1157.28
you think it's all fake yes

1153.52 --> 1165.84
you can drop it now we know

1157.28 --> 1165.84
i'm not gonna try to convince you

1165.919 --> 1170.88
seem to have made up your mind oh yeah

1168.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
by all means you know it's your life

1170.88 --> 1179.8400000000001
it's your spirit

1182.0 --> 1186.48
right and asked this works miracles she

1185.12 --> 1189.9189999999999
said anyone could do

1186.48 --> 1190.72
that and more yes because it is all

1189.919 --> 1193.3600000000001
about

1190.72 --> 1196.72
consciousness ascension about actually

1193.36 --> 1196.7199999999998
understanding getting a grip

1196.799 --> 1207.84
on creation in a natural way

1218.88 --> 1223.3600000000001
yeah george no no you did say that

1224.48 --> 1228.159
when you're gonna say things like jesus

1226.559 --> 1230.96
never said anything it's

1228.159 --> 1232.0800000000002
all just words a man yeah that is

1230.96 --> 1235.3600000000001
literally saying

1232.08 --> 1238.6399999999999
it's fake right

1235.36 --> 1240.8799999999999
it is just because you found

1238.64 --> 1243.2
something else that is truth in there

1240.88 --> 1244.7990000000002
like oh the celestials yeah you that's

1243.2 --> 1249.52
the only truth you think no

1244.799 --> 1251.6
no then you're just wrong

1249.52 --> 1254.0
but that's fine if that's the way you

1251.6 --> 1257.84
want to see it then you do that

1254.0 --> 1257.84
but don't get in my way please

1259.36 --> 1263.1999999999998
why do you think he will take advantage

1261.84 --> 1265.9189999999999
of social i don't think

1263.2 --> 1268.72
when jesus comes back he he will need

1265.919 --> 1272.159
social media steamy traveler

1268.72 --> 1277.84
i think he will simply do it through

1272.159 --> 1277.8400000000001
telepath telepathic communication

1279.919 --> 1282.159
but

1283.84 --> 1291.84
who knows

1302.159 --> 1305.7600000000002
but yeah i don't think that jesus would

1305.12 --> 1308.3999999999999
actually

1305.76 --> 1308.96
interface with with the beast system

1308.4 --> 1312.799
like that

1308.96 --> 1314.96
using social media but who knows

1312.799 --> 1317.039
right who knows if there is even gonna

1314.96 --> 1319.8400000000001
be a social media by the time he comes

1317.039 --> 1319.84
back

1320.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
i'm not sure

1340.48 --> 1343.76
reckon he will be reincarnated

1342.4 --> 1345.1200000000001
spontaneous appearance

1343.76 --> 1347.28
yeah i'm pretty sure it's going to be a

1345.12 --> 1350.32
spontaneous appearance because

1347.28 --> 1351.76
i think he never died like what

1350.32 --> 1354.8799999999999
reincarnation

1351.76 --> 1355.36
he ascended to heaven and when the time

1354.88 --> 1360.0
comes

1355.36 --> 1375.84
he will descend from heaven

1360.0 --> 1375.84
exactly as he was when he left

1377.919 --> 1383.6000000000001
be prepared to do your part

1381.36 --> 1384.8799999999999
well i think that by the time he will

1383.6 --> 1387.039
return we will

1384.88 --> 1389.2800000000002
already be in the middle of things we

1387.039 --> 1403.84
will be well preoccupied

1389.28 --> 1403.84
with doing our part iron fee

1415.52 --> 1417.84
uh

1442.84 --> 1445.84
hmm

1452.799 --> 1456.1589999999999
funny firmament argument on the fed the

1454.96 --> 1458.4
other day well yeah

1456.159 --> 1460.159
but the firmament is always going to be

1458.4 --> 1463.3600000000001
a a complicated

1460.159 --> 1466.5590000000002
thing especially when you try to

1463.36 --> 1469.4399999999998
bridge it through to physics

1466.559 --> 1469.9189999999999
you know because there's very little

1469.44 --> 1472.0800000000002
that's

1469.919 --> 1473.279
actually said about the firmament in the

1472.08 --> 1477.12
bible but it is

1473.279 --> 1477.12
it is awesome that it's in there

1478.0 --> 1481.6
thank you very much for at least leaving

1480.159 --> 1487.8400000000001
something in there

1481.6 --> 1487.84
council of nicaea

1521.919 --> 1525.679
oh god then we discussed the china

1524.0 --> 1529.84
landing on mars

1525.679 --> 1529.8400000000001
wait did they already do it or

1530.88 --> 1535.44
i have heard of it but dude there's so

1534.72 --> 1538.64
much

1535.44 --> 1538.64
of that stuff now

1539.039 --> 1543.84
being suggested

1559.36 --> 1562.3999999999999
if you have some input about it then

1561.2 --> 1566.0
maybe

1562.4 --> 1566.0
i could talk about that

1568.0 --> 1571.6
like i'm not the guy that's like going

1570.88 --> 1574.24
out

1571.6 --> 1576.08
checking out news articles you know if i

1574.24 --> 1577.919
happen to bump into something that i

1576.08 --> 1581.12
find interesting

1577.919 --> 1583.279
then i might post it in the flat earth

1581.12 --> 1587.1999999999998
early birth chat

1583.279 --> 1587.52
but i don't like keep a a track record

1587.2 --> 1591.039
of

1587.52 --> 1594.32
all these types of space things

1591.039 --> 1594.32
that's supposed to be done

1594.88 --> 1598.96
that are in the planning some of these

1596.799 --> 1601.039
things are in planning for a long time

1598.96 --> 1604.559
and then they get cancelled

1601.039 --> 1607.2
the last moment after way way too long

1604.559 --> 1613.84
wait so i don't know you know i don't

1607.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
really keep track of it all

1630.88 --> 1637.6000000000001
yeah so that but

1634.08 --> 1640.32
didn't who went there supposedly with

1637.6 --> 1642.399
the helicopter thing

1640.32 --> 1643.36
that wasn't china right i thought that

1642.399 --> 1645.76
was the us

1643.36 --> 1647.12
but i'm not sure anymore man it's become

1645.76 --> 1651.2
all so

1647.12 --> 1652.7199999999998
messy and to me like it doesn't even

1651.2 --> 1654.96
matter that much

1652.72 --> 1658.96
like which one whoever supposedly did

1654.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
that because it's all nonsense anyway

1658.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
that was nice i thought so right right

1674.0 --> 1680.799
okay steamy traveler

1677.279 --> 1683.6
powers to bypass the laws of physics

1680.799 --> 1685.36
constrained by the laws of physics uh

1683.6 --> 1689.1999999999998
well that's

1685.36 --> 1691.84
that's kind of a complicated question

1689.2 --> 1692.799
i'd say yeah definitely contained by the

1691.84 --> 1696.48
laws of physics

1692.799 --> 1699.9189999999999
as long as they are interacting

1696.48 --> 1703.1200000000001
with the realm right but

1699.919 --> 1707.5200000000002
god designed it

1703.12 --> 1711.1999999999998
so he knows how to you know he

1707.52 --> 1712.799
yeah yeah if you can't command the

1711.2 --> 1714.48
elements that's not like oh

1712.799 --> 1717.76
breaking the laws of it no that's

1714.48 --> 1721.919
literally just using the mechanics

1717.76 --> 1725.36
to to change things

1721.919 --> 1728.3200000000002
right through knowledge of the design

1725.36 --> 1728.32
and what is possible

1730.08 --> 1737.6
so still constrained

1733.919 --> 1740.7900000000002
but just having a lot of ways through

1737.6 --> 1740.79
[Music]

1744.399 --> 1749.1999999999998
right now creator controls create well

1748.48 --> 1750.88
he knows

1749.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
what you can do with creation he

1750.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
designed it

1758.0 --> 1764.72
like he doesn't like the design

1761.039 --> 1765.919
is as made right there is no alteration

1764.72 --> 1769.3600000000001
to the design

1765.919 --> 1772.64
god doesn't just change the design

1769.36 --> 1775.36
on a timeline based fashion like that

1772.64 --> 1777.76
except maybe with with jesus right

1775.36 --> 1779.9189999999999
that's the suggestion

1777.76 --> 1781.52
i think that the design was made

1779.919 --> 1784.88
throughout all time

1781.52 --> 1787.679
so everything that would ever have been

1784.88 --> 1787.679
required

1788.0 --> 1792.799
according to god's plan would have

1789.919 --> 1792.7990000000002
already been

1792.84 --> 1798.1589999999999
preceded pre-designed

1795.76 --> 1799.919
in the overall design throughout time

1798.159 --> 1803.8400000000001
that's what i think

1799.919 --> 1806.8400000000001
right everything just total oversight

1803.84 --> 1809.12
so there's no need really to alter any

1806.84 --> 1812.399
design

1809.12 --> 1814.9599999999998
by god for his purposes

1812.399 --> 1823.279
everything that he would ever need to be

1814.96 --> 1827.2
would already exist

1823.279 --> 1827.2
no iron 26

1828.32 --> 1837.84
too many video games too many video

1831.44 --> 1837.8400000000001
games dude

1848.159 --> 1852.96
man's laws of physics well that's simply

1850.559 --> 1856.72
because man's laws of physics are not

1852.96 --> 1856.72
really that well developed yet

1858.24 --> 1862.559
right there's like physics doesn't even

1861.279 --> 1865.2
know how to deal with

1862.559 --> 1865.84
spirit and consciousness properly like

1865.2 --> 1868.3990000000001
only

1865.84 --> 1870.32
just engaged with the influence of

1868.399 --> 1872.6
consciousness through quantum mechanics

1870.32 --> 1875.4399999999998
only just just

1872.6 --> 1877.9189999999999
microscopic lifting of the veil

1875.44 --> 1880.799
of like a thing that is truly

1877.919 --> 1883.8400000000001
significant in the whole framework

1880.799 --> 1885.679
so this is yeah physics is really not

1883.84 --> 1886.48
that developed yet right so of course

1885.679 --> 1888.48
you're gonna

1886.48 --> 1893.84
find things that like hey that doesn't

1888.48 --> 1893.84
match what we've learned yeah no [ __ ]

1895.039 --> 1900.96
right how about transmutation for

1897.36 --> 1904.08
example what loss of energy

1900.96 --> 1906.3990000000001
like material just disappears

1904.08 --> 1907.12
these things we don't really understand

1906.399 --> 1909.36
yet

1907.12 --> 1911.84
because physics isn't all that well

1909.36 --> 1914.399
developed overall

1911.84 --> 1921.84
it's enough to keep you busy enough to

1914.399 --> 1921.84
engineer things

1932.84 --> 1939.3799999999999
huh

1935.82 --> 1939.3799999999999
[Music]

1946.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
ah

1960.72 --> 1964.24
the laws of physics are not set in stone

1963.44 --> 1967.679
as seen by

1964.24 --> 1976.64
oh really iron fv you have any evidence

1967.679 --> 1977.2
to provide for that claim i'm afraid

1976.64 --> 1979.3600000000001
that

1977.2 --> 1981.279
the laws of physics i take it you mean

1979.36 --> 1984.399
natural laws

1981.279 --> 1986.72
in the field of physics yeah the

1984.399 --> 1988.4799999999998
the thing about them is they are set in

1986.72 --> 1990.0
stone why

1988.48 --> 1992.64
because they could have never been

1990.0 --> 1995.84
disproven

1992.64 --> 1995.8400000000001
right that's the point

1997.36 --> 2004.1589999999999
eventually yeah when every

2000.64 --> 2004.72
other option is is just taken out of the

2004.159 --> 2007.8400000000001
way

2004.72 --> 2019.84
what remains always that's what become a

2007.84 --> 2019.84
natural law

2028.08 --> 2036.0
existence well iron fe yeah existence

2032.08 --> 2037.1999999999998
and that is not what physics concerns

2036.0 --> 2039.6
itself with

2037.2 --> 2042.48
it concerns itself with the physical and

2039.6 --> 2042.48
natural world

2042.88 --> 2047.8400000000001
right not philosophy not like the

2046.08 --> 2050.56
consciousness

2047.84 --> 2051.7599999999998
it barely touches even on that the

2050.56 --> 2055.359
existence of

2051.76 --> 2060.48
information as a substance right

2055.359 --> 2063.52
it all barely touches on that

2060.48 --> 2065.359
and yeah it it keeps itself to that

2063.52 --> 2068.639
field the field of substance

2065.359 --> 2071.2
physical substance or other

2068.639 --> 2072.3990000000003
sorts of substance that have empirical

2071.2 --> 2074.6389999999997
interactions and

2072.399 --> 2076.399
alteration influences on physical

2074.639 --> 2078.639
substance right that's what physics

2076.399 --> 2089.839
concerns itself with

2078.639 --> 2089.839
it's confined to that field

2121.44 --> 2125.04
by the way thank you steamy traveler for

2123.2 --> 2131.839
the good questions

2125.04 --> 2131.839
i appreciate that

2184.56 --> 2201.839
where's everybody gone in the chat

2218.96 --> 2223.2
i wonder in these moments like is it

2220.96 --> 2226.7200000000003
really like

2223.2 --> 2228.96
things that i say because i

2226.72 --> 2231.359
i do put it down in a certain way that i

2228.96 --> 2233.28
guess it would trigger people to really

2231.359 --> 2234.64
think and cross-reference in their own

2233.28 --> 2237.92
mind in the moment

2234.64 --> 2237.92
and they will hang into it

2238.64 --> 2242.16
and that's why then the chat just dies

2240.96 --> 2245.76
for minutes

2242.16 --> 2249.5989999999997
this is i do put down some

2245.76 --> 2249.599
heavy patterns

2249.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
that people could dwell on

2253.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
in a good way i hope

2287.26 --> 2290.3190000000004
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2313.839
so

2324.839 --> 2328.64
so

2326.64 --> 2330.48
i have restrictions over here relaxed a

2328.64 --> 2333.44
bit i think so

2330.48 --> 2333.839
i i'm not fully in the knowledge because

2333.44 --> 2335.92
i

2333.839 --> 2337.2799999999997
literally don't really care what they

2335.92 --> 2339.28
say

2337.28 --> 2340.32
like what the government declares but i

2339.28 --> 2342.2400000000002
think that

2340.32 --> 2344.32
supposedly the restrictions have been

2342.24 --> 2346.24
relaxed

2344.32 --> 2348.2400000000002
i don't know if like the curfew thing

2346.24 --> 2351.2799999999997
has ended

2348.24 --> 2352.24
i think so but just that i don't really

2351.28 --> 2356.5600000000004
care

2352.24 --> 2356.56
this is all of that [ __ ] is illegal

2360.079 --> 2363.3590000000004
yeah ask and receive yeah it is children

2362.48 --> 2365.04
playing there

2363.359 --> 2368.16
that's what i was looking at and also

2365.04 --> 2371.359
like they're being very rowdy out there

2368.16 --> 2371.359
having fun i think they're

2373.28 --> 2377.52
yeah they're playing basketball i think

2375.28 --> 2381.76
some kind of a

2377.52 --> 2383.119
little kid tournament like teenagers

2381.76 --> 2387.76
and there's a lot of people hanging

2383.119 --> 2387.76
around it so they're very excited

2389.92 --> 2397.839
all right

2408.8 --> 2414.0
whatever it happened to nathan thompson

2410.8 --> 2417.28
uh well i don't know

2414.0 --> 2425.839
like he went off the rails for himself i

2417.28 --> 2425.8390000000004
think at some point

2427.2 --> 2439.839
i don't know what he's doing i haven't

2428.56 --> 2439.839
heard from him in a long time

2450.839 --> 2453.839
uh

2464.839 --> 2467.839
hmm

2482.8 --> 2489.6800000000003
right so hey i can just hang here

2487.52 --> 2492.4
and we can listen to the kids playing

2489.68 --> 2495.359
basketball in the distance or

2492.4 --> 2496.88
you could listen to arwen talk about

2495.359 --> 2499.92
things

2496.88 --> 2499.92
if you have a question

2500.24 --> 2512.0
i want me to lay out some subject

2509.28 --> 2513.119
like in for example in what context is

2512.0 --> 2516.319
the title

2513.119 --> 2518.52
lucifer right lucifer so many types of

2516.319 --> 2521.92
approaches to this

2518.52 --> 2525.599
luciferianism and have lucifer

2521.92 --> 2529.92
satan and and then

2525.599 --> 2533.119
you have lucifer the seducer

2529.92 --> 2536.16
in the root of steiner cosmology

2533.119 --> 2540.079
where lucifer is one side and

2536.16 --> 2541.68
everyone is the other side right

2540.079 --> 2543.92
and it was actually meant in that

2541.68 --> 2545.1189999999997
context most of the times when i bring

2543.92 --> 2548.839
up lucifer i

2545.119 --> 2551.839
i specifically refer to rudolf steiner

2548.839 --> 2551.839
cosmology

2568.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
hmm all right steamy traveler i didn't

2570.56 --> 2579.839
know that

2584.72 --> 2593.839
all right see you later iron 26

2614.0 --> 2621.839
all right i'm gonna go for two minutes

2678.48 --> 2680.88
all right

2682.0 --> 2686.4
hey julio peppin good to see you

2689.44 --> 2693.92
right so i now finally properly did my

2702.839 --> 2705.839
hair

2729.2 --> 2747.839
so come on guys throw something at me

2748.64 --> 2750.8799999999997
like

2752.48 --> 2757.599
a thousandth of the early bird huh

2759.44 --> 2764.0
open up live talk to subscribers

2765.599 --> 2769.6800000000003
right uh yeah well

2770.16 --> 2774.319
could do like i'm already kind of opened

2773.28 --> 2776.48
up to

2774.319 --> 2778.96
to do that it's just that nobody seems

2776.48 --> 2778.96
to really

2781.119 --> 2789.04
want to come on necessarily sometimes

2785.2 --> 2803.839
sometimes they do

2789.04 --> 2803.839
but maybe it's also just the hour

2808.48 --> 2813.44
but hey i talk to subscribers even

2811.599 --> 2815.2000000000003
through discord sometimes

2813.44 --> 2819.119
like i bump into them and they tell me

2815.2 --> 2819.1189999999997
like hey yeah watch your show

2820.4 --> 2825.359
that's cool so i am open to talk to my

2828.839 --> 2831.839
subscribers

2838.4 --> 2845.839
okay iron fv

2859.04 --> 2863.7599999999998
okay so what what are you looking into

2861.68 --> 2866.96
exactly

2863.76 --> 2866.96
just the moonlight

2867.28 --> 2870.559
what type of light it is

2870.64 --> 2875.2
it's very different from the sunlight on

2872.559 --> 2875.2000000000003
the spectrum

2876.72 --> 2880.16
or another pattern at least

2885.44 --> 2893.52
99 re infrared reflectivity

2889.119 --> 2897.359
that's interesting makes sense

2893.52 --> 2898.839
like gold doesn't transfer

2897.359 --> 2900.5589999999997
heat and that's something that i've

2898.839 --> 2903.92
learned

2900.559 --> 2906.48
like yeah as a as a goldsmith

2903.92 --> 2908.559
yeah i figured that that's not hard it's

2906.48 --> 2910.64
one of the first thing you learn

2908.559 --> 2912.6400000000003
when you try to work with the material

2910.64 --> 2916.5589999999997
right with gold

2912.64 --> 2920.16
so especially pure gold but even just

2916.559 --> 2921.6800000000003
almost pure gold you can literally have

2920.16 --> 2924.8799999999997
a pin of it

2921.68 --> 2928.0
pure of that material grab it on one end

2924.88 --> 2931.2000000000003
you can have like a blue flame torch on

2928.0 --> 2934.24
the other and you can literally ha

2931.2 --> 2937.4399999999996
grab hold of it on one side melt

2934.24 --> 2938.16
the other tip into pure liquid you can

2937.44 --> 2942.7200000000003
literally see

2938.16 --> 2946.0789999999997
liquefy there and you won't get burned

2942.72 --> 2949.2799999999997
that's how well gold isolates heat

2946.079 --> 2951.28
you do this with the silver pin then way

2949.28 --> 2953.2000000000003
before it's gonna get to the melting

2951.28 --> 2954.0
point on one side you're gonna feel the

2953.2 --> 2955.9199999999996
burn because

2954.0 --> 2958.8
silver actually transfers heat

2955.92 --> 2958.8
incredibly well

2960.16 --> 2963.5989999999997
so that's interesting that you say that

2962.16 --> 2967.68
gold has a 99

2963.599 --> 2967.6800000000003
infrared reflectivity maybe that's

2968.839 --> 2971.839
related

2973.76 --> 2976.0
huh

2981.599 --> 2999.839
doing long-range observation infrared

2984.24 --> 2999.839
using the moon

3007.76 --> 3011.3590000000004
okay that's all very technical but

3010.319 --> 3014.8
interesting though

3011.359 --> 3014.7999999999997
so can you see further

3015.119 --> 3021.839
that way using the moonlight

3018.319 --> 3025.119
with infrared because yeah

3021.839 --> 3027.839
otherwise it seems like pointless to me

3025.119 --> 3027.839
to try and do that

3032.319 --> 3036.0
like is there some advantage to

3034.24 --> 3041.839
attempting this

3036.0 --> 3041.839
in observation

3061.28 --> 3069.8390000000004
feel more likely man walk on the moon

3063.92 --> 3069.839
space catastrophe

3078.319 --> 3084.96
i have no idea as can receive like which

3082.24 --> 3088.0
one do i predict

3084.96 --> 3088.0
what's their game

3089.119 --> 3096.8
now maybe there is a direct pattern

3093.76 --> 3100.0
that is that they might do full-on

3096.8 --> 3102.8
space stuff

3100.0 --> 3103.2
when they actually when there is yeah

3102.8 --> 3105.04
war

3103.2 --> 3106.8799999999997
going to be done and then they use the

3105.04 --> 3109.839
space stuff as a distraction

3106.88 --> 3110.6400000000003
from the nastiness of the war and that

3109.839 --> 3112.5589999999997
yeah when

3110.64 --> 3114.16
space stuff all doesn't work out and

3112.559 --> 3117.3590000000004
crash that means

3114.16 --> 3119.68
no war i don't know maybe i picked up on

3117.359 --> 3122.839
something really ethereal there

3119.68 --> 3125.1189999999997
i don't know if there is that specific

3122.839 --> 3127.359
correlation

3125.119 --> 3127.359
right

3128.24 --> 3133.7599999999998
moon landing did however happen

3131.359 --> 3136.16
like right at the precipice of the

3133.76 --> 3139.8390000000004
vietnam war right or during it even when

3136.16 --> 3139.839
was the vietnam war uh

3140.96 --> 3146.319
so yeah maybe there's some correlation

3143.04 --> 3146.319
like that i'm not sure

3149.76 --> 3152.96
right but that way you could potentially

3152.079 --> 3155.119
find a grip

3152.96 --> 3156.4
on how to predict whether that what are

3155.119 --> 3158.4
they going to do are they going to make

3156.4 --> 3160.8
space stuff successful or are they

3158.4 --> 3162.4
going to trash it again set it back for

3160.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
years

3162.4 --> 3167.839
because that has happened as well

3178.839 --> 3181.839
so

3182.72 --> 3186.8799999999997
during fiat right right

3187.839 --> 3191.52
yeah it's almost like in when you look

3190.079 --> 3195.8390000000004
at it like that it's almost like a

3191.52 --> 3195.839
consolidation price it's

3197.599 --> 3201.2000000000003
like yeah engaging in that war it's

3199.839 --> 3204.72
totally messy

3201.2 --> 3206.5589999999997
then the moon landing to what to

3204.72 --> 3208.3999999999996
feel good about your country and the

3206.559 --> 3212.1600000000003
progress and

3208.4 --> 3213.44
you know patriotism oh we were first on

3212.16 --> 3217.92
the moon

3213.44 --> 3220.079
that's put there obviously to distract

3217.92 --> 3220.559
from the disaster that is the vietnam

3220.079 --> 3222.6400000000003
war

3220.559 --> 3225.52
because the vietnam war is disastrous

3222.64 --> 3237.839
for the united states in many ways

3225.52 --> 3237.839
especially public relations

3248.88 --> 3253.44
crashing the iss in hollywood that's

3251.359 --> 3255.68
ridiculous

3253.44 --> 3257.44
crashing into hologram no what are you

3255.68 --> 3261.1189999999997
talking about

3257.44 --> 3263.44
like the thing the light phenomenon

3261.119 --> 3265.04
associated with the iss that is in the

3263.44 --> 3268.7200000000003
sky at a certain

3265.04 --> 3272.079
point on the earth

3268.72 --> 3272.7999999999997
that well unless it is actually man-made

3272.079 --> 3276.079
or man

3272.8 --> 3278.0
enhanced yeah they could turn it off

3276.079 --> 3280.4
then perhaps but if it's just

3278.0 --> 3282.799
purely as is and they used it as a cover

3280.4 --> 3282.799
story

3283.52 --> 3290.799
as a cover for their story then yeah

3286.72 --> 3296.319
they might simulate cgi whatever

3290.799 --> 3296.319
a a iss crash and then

3296.559 --> 3300.079
just yeah say yeah it's not there

3298.24 --> 3302.24
anymore yeah but we still see it uh

3300.079 --> 3303.3590000000004
blah blah blah whatever it's a space

3302.24 --> 3305.839
wreckage or something

3303.359 --> 3306.5589999999997
you know whatever something ridiculous

3305.839 --> 3310.0789999999997
just to

3306.559 --> 3311.8390000000004
wave it off quickly but yeah nothing

3310.079 --> 3316.4
hologr there's not going to be a

3311.839 --> 3316.4
holographic crash simulation like that

3319.599 --> 3324.2400000000002
but i think that it's not even going to

3321.68 --> 3327.04
come to that because i read articles wow

3324.24 --> 3328.24
that means so much these days but i read

3327.04 --> 3331.44
that

3328.24 --> 3333.7599999999998
the iss is going to be abandoned and

3331.44 --> 3337.44
probably deconstructed and then another

3333.76 --> 3341.8390000000004
space station is going to replace it

3337.44 --> 3345.2000000000003
so this on rt so i don't know if that's

3341.839 --> 3349.2
real like if that's really the plan or

3345.2 --> 3349.2
just a suggestion but it seemed like

3350.72 --> 3357.2799999999997
might be part of the plan

3354.079 --> 3359.599
so they might abandon the iss

3357.28 --> 3362.0
as a project and replace it again with

3359.599 --> 3364.319
another station

3362.0 --> 3365.28
or even split it up the projects have

3364.319 --> 3376.079
separate russian

3365.28 --> 3378.4
and separate american

3376.079 --> 3381.2000000000003
didn't the enemies of the u.s point out

3378.4 --> 3383.119
the fakery of the moon landing

3381.2 --> 3385.9199999999996
well because they were engaging in the

3383.119 --> 3389.44
same type of fakery

3385.92 --> 3390.799
they couldn't dispel it they couldn't

3389.44 --> 3394.0
point it out

3390.799 --> 3397.28
within the frame

3394.0 --> 3399.92
yet right

3397.28 --> 3401.28
they could have suspicions but yeah look

3399.92 --> 3405.839
what they got a bunch of

3401.28 --> 3405.8390000000004
television quality imagery

3407.76 --> 3411.3590000000004
and yeah they just

3412.799 --> 3417.68
they were engaging in that dream

3415.359 --> 3421.7599999999998
themselves for their public

3417.68 --> 3421.7599999999998
so they just didn't point it out

3422.48 --> 3426.559
it wasn't the information age yet

3431.28 --> 3436.3190000000004
but hey who knows man maybe even in that

3433.92 --> 3439.04
time there were still plenty of people

3436.319 --> 3440.64
like on the russian side they would say

3439.04 --> 3442.96
like uh the americans they

3440.64 --> 3445.44
they faked the moon landing but we are

3442.96 --> 3449.92
not supposed to talk about it

3445.44 --> 3449.92
right something like that

3452.16 --> 3455.44
they would just have to hold their

3458.839 --> 3461.839
tongue

3486.839 --> 3489.839
do

3515.44 --> 3533.68
hmm who knows iron iffy

3530.24 --> 3537.359
all right yeah tuesday's back

3533.68 --> 3541.68
baller of course

3537.359 --> 3544.88
well to say c iss is cgi

3541.68 --> 3548.0
that's technically incorrect

3544.88 --> 3551.2000000000003
it's a combination of things there's

3548.0 --> 3555.119
three different things to the iss

3551.2 --> 3558.24
project right there's the celestial

3555.119 --> 3560.96
light phenomena in that weird shape

3558.24 --> 3562.16
which might have been mechanically

3560.96 --> 3565.04
enhanced

3562.16 --> 3566.72
through nasa technology i yeah i went

3565.04 --> 3567.52
through that paper on one of my very

3566.72 --> 3570.9599999999996
first shows

3567.52 --> 3573.04
with robert shortman on this channel

3570.96 --> 3574.64
like they have that technology how to

3573.04 --> 3578.0
basically weirdly enough

3574.64 --> 3580.48
like point lasers and then

3578.0 --> 3581.119
amplify the light output for a prolonged

3580.48 --> 3583.92
time

3581.119 --> 3585.28
like even permanently it was very

3583.92 --> 3588.7200000000003
surreal for me

3585.28 --> 3591.119
to see that like but yeah

3588.72 --> 3593.68
if that is if that is real then they

3591.119 --> 3596.7200000000003
could basically like modify celestial

3593.68 --> 3596.72
phenomena perhaps

3597.2 --> 3600.799
and maybe they have enhanced like beefed

3600.0 --> 3604.24
it up

3600.799 --> 3607.68
energy eat it up the iss like

3604.24 --> 3609.04
yeah and i can't really provide a proper

3607.68 --> 3612.16
framework

3609.04 --> 3615.2
in order to understand how they did that

3612.16 --> 3616.72
based on my knowledge of what yeah how

3615.2 --> 3620.48
things really work out here

3616.72 --> 3624.0789999999997
right how can you point

3620.48 --> 3624.079
at his space and then

3625.92 --> 3632.48
yeah enhance energy in

3629.04 --> 3635.599
something that then continues to

3632.48 --> 3636.48
rotate in the virtual rotation i don't

3635.599 --> 3639.28
get it

3636.48 --> 3640.88
i don't understand that it's freaky it's

3639.28 --> 3644.3190000000004
very very weird

3640.88 --> 3647.52
but if well maybe then

3644.319 --> 3650.5589999999997
you know but yeah that's one element

3647.52 --> 3654.88
it's a celestial light phenomenon then

3650.559 --> 3657.76
there is the props

3654.88 --> 3659.28
say the the models which are probably

3657.76 --> 3663.76
not cgi

3659.28 --> 3667.44
with actual visuals uh that they use

3663.76 --> 3669.44
uh underwater and another prop setting

3667.44 --> 3670.7200000000003
for where they have a micro model for a

3669.44 --> 3674.079
more distant

3670.72 --> 3676.3999999999996
fuse with the well the the earth

3674.079 --> 3677.3590000000004
is cgi in that case the earth is like

3676.4 --> 3680.48
completely

3677.359 --> 3684.799
bent sap in a separate frame

3680.48 --> 3688.0
but the model is just a small model

3684.799 --> 3690.64
that is not cgi it's a model

3688.0 --> 3691.76
and then they use that for the space

3690.64 --> 3694.48
view

3691.76 --> 3696.1600000000003
and then there is the inside of the iss

3694.48 --> 3699.76
and that is a studio with

3696.16 --> 3703.2
wires and [ __ ]

3699.76 --> 3706.3190000000004
so there's three distinct different

3703.2 --> 3709.839
setups to the iss fakery

3706.319 --> 3713.52
celestial phenomena the model with the

3709.839 --> 3716.0789999999997
cgi'd or modified

3713.52 --> 3716.88
earth visual in the background and then

3716.079 --> 3720.0
there's the

3716.88 --> 3722.96
internal works studio

3720.0 --> 3724.839
and oh yeah and the water tank which is

3722.96 --> 3727.839
i guess there's four

3724.839 --> 3727.839
setups

3732.079 --> 3741.8390000000004
hey good servant good to see you

3752.839 --> 3755.839
so

3756.799 --> 3760.799
right yeah and george sanford yeah in

3759.039 --> 3763.76
the studio

3760.799 --> 3764.319
astronauts inside the iss setup yeah

3763.76 --> 3768.6400000000003
they do

3764.319 --> 3772.24
use all kinds of weird cgi tricks

3768.64 --> 3772.24
like objects

3772.4 --> 3776.96
that the astronauts interact with and

3774.88 --> 3777.76
then they let go and it starts floating

3776.96 --> 3781.039
yeah that is

3777.76 --> 3783.2000000000003
like a separate cgi input that they

3781.039 --> 3784.3190000000004
have been testing there and it mocks up

3783.2 --> 3786.72
a lot and then like

3784.319 --> 3788.799
glitches it keeps hanging around and you

3786.72 --> 3791.839
see the astronauts

3788.799 --> 3797.28
grabbing nothing doing nothing and

3791.839 --> 3799.2
yeah it's very weird

3797.28 --> 3800.4
they they're being sloppy on purpose

3799.2 --> 3802.3999999999996
with that [ __ ]

3800.4 --> 3804.0
no not a chance that that's by

3802.4 --> 3811.839
coincidence

3804.0 --> 3811.839
i don't know why

3829.359 --> 3839.839
hey james mason

3849.27 --> 3853.839
[Music]

3850.839 --> 3853.839
hmm

3857.9 --> 3862.15
[Music]

3892.839 --> 3895.839
hmm

3906.079 --> 3912.48
yeah it's hilarious

3909.599 --> 3913.039
yeah yeah but tiny womble is perhaps

3912.48 --> 3915.68
correct

3913.039 --> 3917.5200000000004
yeah if it were possible it would be

3915.68 --> 3920.64
cheaper to just build the space station

3917.52 --> 3920.64
in orbit you're right

3920.839 --> 3926.0789999999997
although probably the

3924.079 --> 3927.2000000000003
creating the props in the studios for

3926.079 --> 3929.039
the fakery

3927.2 --> 3931.2
might have been an initial investment

3929.039 --> 3934.3190000000004
that might have been expensive

3931.2 --> 3937.839
but after that not so much it's very

3934.319 --> 3937.839
cheap to keep it running

3940.799 --> 3946.72
but yeah the problem is you can't build

3943.839 --> 3949.839
a space station up there because

3946.72 --> 3950.319
yeah relative density doesn't stop you

3949.839 --> 3953.0389999999998
can't

3950.319 --> 3954.319
have things floating up there without

3953.039 --> 3956.6400000000003
providing constant

3954.319 --> 3956.64
lift

3958.0 --> 3964.24
you can't spin around a non-ball earth

3961.839 --> 3965.119
and then through the momentum of the

3964.24 --> 3968.72
spin

3965.119 --> 3970.88
that you can't do yeah stay in

3968.72 --> 3974.5589999999997
equilibrium with the relative density

3970.88 --> 3974.559
displacement that's not possible

3976.839 --> 3979.839
unfortunately

3985.76 --> 3990.3190000000004
but yeah if it were possible then just

3988.0 --> 3992.48
building an iss station would probably

3990.319 --> 3995.839
be cheaper that's right

3992.48 --> 3998.319
fortunately though there's also the

3995.839 --> 4002.5589999999997
issue with all the satellites that

3998.319 --> 4002.5589999999997
yeah don't really exist up there

4003.359 --> 4006.48
and they never have disasters which they

4005.76 --> 4010.48
should have

4006.48 --> 4010.48
constantly constantly

4012.96 --> 4017.92
officially right a lot of non-existent

4015.76 --> 4019.92
satellites supposedly in orbit

4017.92 --> 4021.2000000000003
or hanging geostationary all that

4019.92 --> 4025.119
nonsense

4021.2 --> 4027.839
yeah that would actually make it a lot

4025.119 --> 4027.839
harder to do

4028.559 --> 4034.559
but yeah you can place unlimited

4031.839 --> 4035.7599999999998
imaginary things in a presupposed

4034.559 --> 4038.96
spherical orbit

4035.76 --> 4042.2400000000002
around the earth geostationary or yeah

4038.96 --> 4042.2400000000002
in an active orbit

4043.599 --> 4047.6800000000003
you can place unlimited virtual things

4045.68 --> 4051.44
there because virtual things don't

4047.68 --> 4051.44
actually bump into one another

4051.52 --> 4058.559
and you can only or you can then even

4055.28 --> 4059.599
make them bump into each other as a part

4058.559 --> 4061.6800000000003
of the story

4059.599 --> 4063.44
in order to make some point of that it's

4061.68 --> 4065.44
possible and how great they are that

4063.44 --> 4066.079
they've managed to prevent it so far so

4065.44 --> 4069.2000000000003
long

4066.079 --> 4069.2000000000003
right that sort of [ __ ]

4069.52 --> 4073.44
but yeah when it's virtual you can place

4071.68 --> 4075.2799999999997
as many things up there as you like

4073.44 --> 4077.039
because in actuality there's nothing

4075.28 --> 4078.3190000000004
really bumping into one another so they

4077.039 --> 4081.119
can just leave it out of the

4078.319 --> 4081.119
storytelling

4083.96 --> 4087.05
[Music]

4089.599 --> 4093.2000000000003
that's too boost every now and then

4103.279 --> 4108.080000000001
yeah but that still doesn't work tiny

4116.839 --> 4119.839
bumble

4127.97 --> 4131.6
[Music]

4129.839 --> 4135.2789999999995
i don't know steamy traveler how does

4131.6 --> 4138.799
this app know probably because it uses a

4135.279 --> 4146.0
celestial phenomenon that is cyclical

4138.799 --> 4149.5199999999995
and predictable and then they use that

4146.0 --> 4149.52
don't know it's weird

4153.279 --> 4158.64
but has any have you ever actually seen

4156.56 --> 4161.759
it

4158.64 --> 4162.799
up there has anybody actually seen the

4161.759 --> 4165.679
iss

4162.799 --> 4165.679
light phenomena

4169.12 --> 4172.839
like not through somebody else's story

4171.52 --> 4176.4800000000005
or through some

4172.839 --> 4178.88
video or photograph anybody else made

4176.48 --> 4189.839
have you ever actually seen it

4178.88 --> 4189.839
i haven't

4195.5 --> 4198.689
[Music]

4200.84 --> 4203.84
huh

4209.28 --> 4212.32
have i looked for it

4212.88 --> 4219.6
well no but if it's visible then i

4216.32 --> 4219.599999999999
should be able to see it

4221.44 --> 4226.719
i definitely pay attention to lights

4224.719 --> 4228.64
in the sky especially ones that move

4226.719 --> 4233.12
quick enough for me to pick up

4228.64 --> 4236.2390000000005
that they are moving right

4233.12 --> 4238.08
that includes airplanes so yeah i

4236.239 --> 4240.32
definitely pay attention to the lights

4238.08 --> 4243.36
in this guys

4240.32 --> 4245.12
and if it's up there then i

4243.36 --> 4246.5599999999995
assumed that i would be able to see it

4245.12 --> 4248.719
at some point

4246.56 --> 4259.84
just randomly you know i i look at the

4248.719 --> 4259.84
sky a lot

4265.44 --> 4268.719
no seen it many times oh yeah lights

4268.0 --> 4270.88
moving

4268.719 --> 4273.84
well yeah like i see lights moving

4270.88 --> 4273.84
sometimes

4289.679 --> 4295.52
i never seen a light that was like

4292.96 --> 4301.84
iss shaped though i never seen light

4295.52 --> 4301.84
phenomena like that

4327.679 --> 4330.8
right steamy traveler well then i wonder

4330.08 --> 4343.84
like

4330.8 --> 4343.84
what equipment did they use

4345.76 --> 4349.360000000001
then yeah who are they amateur

4348.32 --> 4352.799999999999
astronomers

4349.36 --> 4355.28
like who are these people and hey

4352.8 --> 4356.56
i can't exclude that there is something

4355.28 --> 4359.04
that actually

4356.56 --> 4359.84
does look like the iss as i said maybe

4359.04 --> 4362.0
they put

4359.84 --> 4365.04
a hologram up there through their

4362.0 --> 4366.8
technology that i even reviewed

4365.04 --> 4368.88
one of my first hangouts with robert

4366.8 --> 4372.64
shortman

4368.88 --> 4373.4400000000005
like they can apparently put holograms

4372.64 --> 4377.6
up there

4373.44 --> 4377.599999999999
so maybe that is what the iss is

4379.76 --> 4390.0
like serious like celestial mind [ __ ]

4384.88 --> 4390.0
celestial illusions holograms

4391.36 --> 4395.679
who knows right as i said before like it

4395.04 --> 4399.5199999999995
could be

4395.679 --> 4401.679
just a of shaped like the iss

4399.52 --> 4403.120000000001
but that they then can almost like

4401.679 --> 4405.52
sculpt

4403.12 --> 4407.679
using their lasers yeah this sounds

4405.52 --> 4409.76
really bizarre i know but

4407.679 --> 4411.36
they figured it out i think i read that

4409.76 --> 4413.1990000000005
paper

4411.36 --> 4414.88
from a long time ago so maybe they

4413.199 --> 4417.199
figured out how to sculpt

4414.88 --> 4418.0
that light how to modify it and make it

4417.199 --> 4421.36
just

4418.0 --> 4423.6
appear exactly like the iss

4421.36 --> 4423.599999999999
[ __ ]

4424.48 --> 4428.32
because it already had the the bottom

4426.88 --> 4431.6
line shape of it

4428.32 --> 4434.239
then they modify it to become really

4431.6 --> 4434.88
detailed who knows they might be able to

4434.239 --> 4438.48
do that

4434.88 --> 4439.6
they might have done that yeah laugh it

4438.48 --> 4441.839999999999
up

4439.6 --> 4441.84
tom

4443.28 --> 4448.8
why don't you read the paper actually

4445.679 --> 4448.8
published by nasa

4450.56 --> 4455.1990000000005
just check out one of my very first

4452.84 --> 4458.32
shows

4455.199 --> 4469.839999999999
yeah two shows with robert shortman it's

4458.32 --> 4469.84
in one of those

4475.6 --> 4483.84
what's that steamy traveler

4492.08 --> 4497.84
all right

4526.08 --> 4529.92
yeah that just seems like a light it's

4528.96 --> 4533.679
funny how the

4529.92 --> 4533.679
telescope thing showed that

4534.96 --> 4539.84
that frame work thing right

4539.92 --> 4544.4
so yeah what what is that that's an

4542.8 --> 4548.08
interesting link

4544.4 --> 4548.08
steamy traveler but what is it

4548.159 --> 4554.4
so the actual direct zooming in

4551.28 --> 4558.32
just it was just a star but

4554.4 --> 4560.879999999999
for some reason in the big

4558.32 --> 4567.44
yeah electronic telescope that you saw

4560.88 --> 4581.84
that picture of the iss in there

4567.44 --> 4581.839999999999
well yeah what kind of telescope is that

4592.84 --> 4598.96
so

4594.4 --> 4598.96
what what are you talking about

4606.84 --> 4609.84
terminoid

4620.84 --> 4623.84
so

4629.52 --> 4632.56
all right well the whole thing about

4630.96 --> 4636.159
digital

4632.56 --> 4639.4400000000005
is it would be technically possible

4636.159 --> 4642.48
to put

4639.44 --> 4646.96
extra information inserted

4642.48 --> 4649.5199999999995
over the imagery right

4646.96 --> 4651.36
and yeah celestial things would be

4649.52 --> 4654.2390000000005
exactly

4651.36 --> 4654.239
down that lane

4654.719 --> 4665.84
can be could be just yes a second layer

4659.679 --> 4665.84
let's put on there

4668.88 --> 4671.92
just kind of spitballing here it's not

4670.8 --> 4675.76
really

4671.92 --> 4675.76
my technical expertise

4676.84 --> 4680.2390000000005
uh yeah

4680.48 --> 4693.839999999999
good servant why do you bring that up

4697.04 --> 4703.04
wow talk about projection there

4700.159 --> 4703.04
sebastian

4703.92 --> 4709.76
cry out for attention no

4707.199 --> 4709.759999999999
not really

4712.64 --> 4716.4800000000005
now we're just curious in trying to

4714.64 --> 4720.719
figure out what's going on

4716.48 --> 4723.759999999999
sebastian right

4720.719 --> 4726.56
and we're not going to accept the

4723.76 --> 4730.08
[ __ ] suspense of disbelief nonsense

4726.56 --> 4732.2390000000005
that heliocentrism and government

4730.08 --> 4733.36
tells us to believe that's the

4732.239 --> 4736.48
difference

4733.36 --> 4736.88
that's not crying out for attention it's

4736.48 --> 4739.44
just

4736.88 --> 4749.84
we're curious we're a curious bunch we

4739.44 --> 4749.839999999999
want to know what's going on

4752.08 --> 4757.44
yeah thanks stevie traveler for being in

4753.76 --> 4757.4400000000005
the stream in chat

4757.76 --> 4763.84
take care have a good day

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4781.7 --> 4784.739
[Music]

4795.12 --> 4805.84
oh dear it's getting a lot more clouded

4798.32 --> 4805.84
it's gonna stay dry

4827.52 --> 4833.84
huh okay that's interesting iron effie

4854.4 --> 4864.08
okay tomonoi that's bizarre

4860.65 --> 4867.5199999999995
[Music]

4864.08 --> 4867.5199999999995
well that's certainly gonna be

4868.08 --> 4871.199
a curiosity

4872.239 --> 4875.44
if he's really to do that or attempt to

4874.32 --> 4878.239
do that

4875.44 --> 4878.239
to trick that

4883.52 --> 4889.84
it's like making a movie in a movie

4900.84 --> 4904.639
bizarre

4902.88 --> 4906.8
i wonder what that what it's going to be

4904.639 --> 4906.8
like

4907.76 --> 4911.52
like are there's also going to be like

4909.92 --> 4913.4400000000005
the real astronauts in there because

4911.52 --> 4915.6
then it would probably be more like the

4913.44 --> 4917.759999999999
astronauts are going to get invited into

4915.6 --> 4919.52
hollywood studio and actually do

4917.76 --> 4931.84
everything the right way and not the

4919.52 --> 4931.84
clumsy way

4942.84 --> 4945.84
uh

4949.92 --> 4956.159
that might spoil them yeah

4952.96 --> 4957.28
yeah it will they'll be all cocky and

4956.159 --> 4959.5199999999995
[ __ ]

4957.28 --> 4961.5199999999995
like yeah see we are real this is what

4959.52 --> 4964.400000000001
it's supposed to be

4961.52 --> 4966.719
not that messed up [ __ ] not the boring

4964.4 --> 4966.719
stuff

4966.8 --> 4970.2390000000005
that's hilarious termino yeah it might

4968.719 --> 4973.84
actually spoil them

4970.239 --> 4973.839999999999
if that if that happens

4984.84 --> 4987.84
hmm

5009.2 --> 5012.51
[Music]

5045.6 --> 5049.360000000001
all right yeah iron fe well in 2015 i

5048.639 --> 5057.52
was just

5049.36 --> 5059.199
hanging around on the internet

5057.52 --> 5061.120000000001
especially with mark sergeant and

5059.199 --> 5063.759999999999
patricia steer back then when they were

5061.12 --> 5063.76
still duo

5064.48 --> 5067.199
great times

5069.36 --> 5074.799999999999
and yeah nathan oakley too and martin

5072.56 --> 5078.4800000000005
lipka already during that time like

5074.8 --> 5078.4800000000005
the first wave as i see it

5079.04 --> 5082.8
i didn't really go to any flatter

5080.8 --> 5085.4400000000005
society already figured out like yeah

5082.8 --> 5088.159000000001
this is

5085.44 --> 5088.5599999999995
just by some of the suggestions it's

5088.159 --> 5092.159
like

5088.56 --> 5092.96
it's a mock-up everything they do is a

5092.159 --> 5095.36
mock-up i

5092.96 --> 5096.4800000000005
have no respect for them whatsoever it's

5095.36 --> 5100.239
a complete mock-up

5096.48 --> 5100.239
on purpose it's really stupid

5102.14 --> 5105.249000000001
[Music]

5111.199 --> 5116.32
and besides even back then i had so many

5114.48 --> 5119.36
memories to cross-reference

5116.32 --> 5122.5599999999995
with myself it's all the times

5119.36 --> 5126.32
before that i've been confronted with

5122.56 --> 5130.0
the earth being flat

5126.32 --> 5130.0
from different types of groups

5130.4 --> 5135.199
and then like entertaining it slightly

5133.199 --> 5138.08
and then after a while kind of rejecting

5135.199 --> 5140.0
it or forgetting about it

5138.08 --> 5142.0
and it's been very fascinating in that

5140.0 --> 5144.719
time to basically cross-reference with

5142.0 --> 5147.84
so many periods in my life like they all

5144.719 --> 5148.96
came right there it's like whoa i now

5147.84 --> 5152.96
have the key

5148.96 --> 5154.88
code to actually decipher

5152.96 --> 5169.84
a lot of what was said back then that i

5154.88 --> 5169.84
didn't understand yet

5192.56 --> 5197.92
sebastian stop stop cash lighting

5196.0 --> 5201.199
yourself buddy

5197.92 --> 5203.76
we're not buying it it's all

5201.199 --> 5203.759999999999
nonsense

5204.719 --> 5207.76
everything everything you point at is

5207.28 --> 5211.04
all

5207.76 --> 5213.360000000001
always the heavens because yeah

5211.04 --> 5214.08
you just assume all these things told

5213.36 --> 5217.5199999999995
about them

5214.08 --> 5219.76
is what they are and your physicality

5217.52 --> 5220.96
assumption bias is holding those beliefs

5219.76 --> 5225.280000000001
into place

5220.96 --> 5228.639
but yeah it's very very typical that in

5225.28 --> 5232.08
in your gaslighting attempt you don't

5228.639 --> 5234.88
mention anything about earth itself

5232.08 --> 5235.92
right yeah we know we know why because

5234.88 --> 5240.08
the earth is so

5235.92 --> 5241.92
flat you don't have a geometric horizon

5240.08 --> 5243.6
for your sphere that you believe you're

5241.92 --> 5245.679
standing on

5243.6 --> 5247.92
black swan completely destroyed that

5245.679 --> 5253.04
forever

5247.92 --> 5254.639
you don't even know what gravity is

5253.04 --> 5258.08
there's no gas pressure without a

5254.639 --> 5261.84
containment of some kind

5258.08 --> 5263.28
a limited volume right not endless outer

5261.84 --> 5265.6
space vacuum

5263.28 --> 5267.44
so yeah you have nothing to stand on

5265.6 --> 5268.159000000001
literally all you can do is just point

5267.44 --> 5269.759999999999
at the sky

5268.159 --> 5272.719
and see oh wow look at all these

5269.76 --> 5275.4400000000005
celestial phenomena this holographic

5272.719 --> 5277.84
non-local light based manifestations

5275.44 --> 5279.04
that have no origin point in euclidean

5277.84 --> 5280.8
space

5279.04 --> 5283.76
that are staring us in the face with

5280.8 --> 5285.76
their bizarre natures and suggestions

5283.76 --> 5288.320000000001
and

5285.76 --> 5289.88
cyclical nature yeah we know it's very

5288.32 --> 5291.84
mysterious it doesn't prove

5289.88 --> 5294.159000000001
heliocentrism in the slightest though

5291.84 --> 5297.92
even though entire heliocentrism

5294.159 --> 5301.36
space cosmology has been based

5297.92 --> 5303.679
as an offset as a starting point on

5301.36 --> 5304.88
the cyclical nature of the heavens yeah

5303.679 --> 5307.52
we know

5304.88 --> 5308.639
it doesn't prove heliocentrism though at

5307.52 --> 5311.280000000001
all

5308.639 --> 5313.679
sorry about that you have no physical

5311.28 --> 5313.679
evidence

5313.76 --> 5318.0
you have no physical evidence the

5315.44 --> 5321.199
celestial bodies even are

5318.0 --> 5322.239
physical in any way you don't have this

5321.199 --> 5324.0
evidence

5322.239 --> 5326.0
they don't abide by the laws of

5324.0 --> 5329.28
perspective

5326.0 --> 5331.44
in firsque law for light they don't have

5329.28 --> 5334.5599999999995
a euclidean position that can be

5331.44 --> 5335.5199999999995
literally pointed at approached you can

5334.56 --> 5339.679
only do

5335.52 --> 5341.84
earth level based triangulation

5339.679 --> 5343.04
based on the presupposition of standing

5341.84 --> 5344.8
on a sphere

5343.04 --> 5346.4
for the celestial bodies in order to

5344.8 --> 5347.76
make your case

5346.4 --> 5349.599999999999
right you can only do a bunch of

5347.76 --> 5353.08
calculation trickery

5349.6 --> 5354.719
to even make it have any sense within

5353.08 --> 5356.32
heliocentrism

5354.719 --> 5359.199
because you don't have any proof or any

5356.32 --> 5365.84
of it at all

5359.199 --> 5365.839999999999
sebastian we tap dax bix whatever

5373.6 --> 5376.88
yeah well sebastian winterbigs show me

5376.4 --> 5381.199
one

5376.88 --> 5381.84
single aspect yeah of heliocentrism that

5381.199 --> 5384.96
has been

5381.84 --> 5388.0
brought into use a discovery

5384.96 --> 5388.96
relating to heliocentrism implemented in

5388.0 --> 5391.84
the real world

5388.96 --> 5394.4800000000005
why don't you show me that sebastian

5391.84 --> 5394.4800000000005
weetabix

5395.199 --> 5402.48
show me show me where it is implemented

5398.28 --> 5405.679
heliocentrist things

5402.48 --> 5406.08
except a lot of imagery dangle in our

5405.679 --> 5408.88
face

5406.08 --> 5409.76
and a lot of virtual mathematical based

5408.88 --> 5411.6
reasoning

5409.76 --> 5412.8
yeah show me where it's actually

5411.6 --> 5416.08
implemented

5412.8 --> 5418.8
physically here on earth

5416.08 --> 5420.96
engineering oh really well engineering

5418.8 --> 5423.56
can happen

5420.96 --> 5425.12
very easily without space or

5423.56 --> 5428.0
heliocentrism

5425.12 --> 5429.92
right engineering has always been there

5428.0 --> 5431.679
navigation has nothing to do with

5429.92 --> 5434.08
heliocentrism it uses

5431.679 --> 5435.12
the sky clock it uses the globe of the

5434.08 --> 5438.08
heavens

5435.12 --> 5440.719
the literal globe even in the

5438.08 --> 5442.96
renaissance age the literal globe of the

5440.719 --> 5446.4
stars that they used right

5442.96 --> 5450.0
that's what they used it has nothing to

5446.4 --> 5452.239
do with heliocentrism in the slightest

5450.0 --> 5455.28
they used that way before they even made

5452.239 --> 5457.678999999999
a claim of the earth being a ball

5455.28 --> 5458.88
yeah and then they reified that

5457.679 --> 5462.56
celestial globe

5458.88 --> 5464.96
into the earth being a globe too

5462.56 --> 5465.76
and that's how the earth being a globe

5464.96 --> 5471.84
started to

5465.76 --> 5471.84
seep into the into the culture into the

5474.84 --> 5478.639
schools

5476.639 --> 5480.639
oh by the way thank you drunken bullet

5478.639 --> 5484.719
for

5480.639 --> 5484.719
all the super chat donations appreciate

5488.84 --> 5491.84
that

5495.6 --> 5498.56
i'm doing great

5502.88 --> 5506.88
if you really want to help me out

5504.6 --> 5507.92
drunkenbullet401 i'd appreciate if you

5506.88 --> 5511.04
send me

5507.92 --> 5511.04
paypal donations

5512.08 --> 5519.84
if that's what you'd want to do

5520.8 --> 5526.96
oh so sebastian witabix

5524.56 --> 5527.84
are you hearing me because i just

5526.96 --> 5530.719
addressed

5527.84 --> 5531.679
your original offset argument every

5530.719 --> 5533.92
aerospace

5531.679 --> 5534.96
engineering navigation i addressed every

5533.92 --> 5538.96
part of that yeah

5534.96 --> 5538.96
aerospace is [ __ ] by the way

5541.04 --> 5544.84
right you don't need heliocentrism to

5543.6 --> 5547.92
figure out

5544.84 --> 5549.4400000000005
aerodynamics right aerodynamics only

5547.92 --> 5551.76
works

5549.44 --> 5553.199
in a container right when there's

5551.76 --> 5555.679
pressure

5553.199 --> 5557.5199999999995
you don't need outer space to figure out

5555.679 --> 5561.28
aerodynamics that's why it's

5557.52 --> 5564.719
aero dynamics right and not

5561.28 --> 5564.719
vacuum dynamics

5569.92 --> 5575.76
so yeah everything you said was

5573.04 --> 5576.08
supposedly rolling out of heliocentrism

5575.76 --> 5578.639
and

5576.08 --> 5580.159
out of all that knowledge that you think

5578.639 --> 5583.84
is real

5580.159 --> 5583.839999999999
i refuted every part of that

5584.96 --> 5590.96
spam the link then uh

5588.639 --> 5590.96

if you bring it up early in the show

5789.119 --> 5799.839999999999
then i might like look into it

5791.44 --> 5799.839999999999
i've never heard of that before

5801.92 --> 5806.719
oh by the way wanna hear an invention

5804.719 --> 5809.44
and technological application

5806.719 --> 5811.36
that the flat earth has actually

5809.44 --> 5815.04
provided

5811.36 --> 5818.719
in contrast to the globe

5815.04 --> 5819.84
one here one sextant now there's a

5818.719 --> 5822.88
direct

5819.84 --> 5826.2390000000005
technological application

5822.88 --> 5827.84
of the earth being flat ask 10th man

5826.239 --> 5829.28
about it he's talking about it all the

5827.84 --> 5831.28
time he knows every detail

5829.28 --> 5832.48
but it's true it's a direct

5831.28 --> 5836.88
technological

5832.48 --> 5840.0
application from the earth being flat

5836.88 --> 5842.88
and in combination with the sky clock

5840.0 --> 5844.8
isn't that interesting literal piece of

5842.88 --> 5847.52
technological application

5844.8 --> 5848.159000000001
derived directly from the earth being

5847.52 --> 5852.400000000001
flat

5848.159 --> 5855.679
how about that oh here's another one

5852.4 --> 5859.119
a lighthouse yeah

5855.679 --> 5861.92
lighthouses direct technological

5859.119 --> 5864.48
application a thing that is done because

5861.92 --> 5868.719
the earth is flat

5864.48 --> 5870.5599999999995
yeah oh yeah now that

5868.719 --> 5872.56
that i'm starting this up i could think

5870.56 --> 5875.4400000000005
about a whole bunch of things like that

5872.56 --> 5878.719
direct technological applications based

5875.44 --> 5878.719
on the earth being flat

5881.28 --> 5885.759999999999
anyway i'm gonna have to leave it for
