through the super Chad's paypal patreon

62.87 --> 71.72
and my GoFundMe good day everyone

66.2 --> 74.15
so yeah it's I got a shirt on finally it

71.72 --> 78.07
cooled down a bit there's a lot of

74.15 --> 84.56
clouds it's still kind of warm though

78.07 --> 88.90899999999999
but just more it's not as warm and much

84.56 --> 94.52000000000001
more moist still very pleasant after all

88.909 --> 96.53
this heatwave to have this and it's it's

94.52 --> 98.6
funny because I'm just noticing that I'm

96.53 --> 101.12
not seeing a lot of birds around so it's

98.6 --> 104.03
very likely they're all just catching up

101.12 --> 107.45
on sleep like a lot of people probably

104.03 --> 111.11
are I had a great sleep this night up

107.45 --> 113.47
until pretty late like 10 o'clock which

111.11 --> 117.71
is kind of normal time for me finally

113.47 --> 119.479
but I went to bed really late to 3

117.71 --> 121.15899999999999
o'clock it was terrible but that's

119.479 --> 129.89
because I had one of the last trains

121.159 --> 132.34900000000002
back and it was very intense day I can

129.89 --> 134.89
still feel it it's it literally feels

132.349 --> 139.97
like I just came back from a vacation

134.89 --> 142.95899999999997
and nostalgic because it was really good

139.97 --> 147.17
and I got to meet my friend's daughter

142.959 --> 153.14000000000001
who was almost 2 years old it was just

147.17 --> 157.39999999999998
an incredible person and she was um yeah

153.14 --> 161.08999999999997
she was talking or trying it out and I

157.4 --> 163.43
was just astonished because when she

161.09 --> 165.62
tried to speak she literally tried to

163.43 --> 168.17000000000002
put out an entire sentence

165.62 --> 170.209
and I could hear that she was doing it

168.17 --> 173.20899999999997
correct she just couldn't fall find all

170.209 --> 176.86
the words yet well she was like falling

173.209 --> 183.68
in line of starting a complex sentence

176.86 --> 186.83
so that was just yeah it was an amazing

183.68 --> 191.75
girl I was kind of jealous or well

186.83 --> 193.84900000000002
jealous like yeah jealous her dad not

191.75 --> 198.019
really that great of a guy and I'm just

193.849 --> 207.67999999999998
like wow that guy that guy has to get a

198.019 --> 210.59
kid well but it was an amazing day at

207.68 --> 217.61
did some gardening work I love that [ __ ]

210.59 --> 219.379
and it yeah she needed it so yeah let's

217.61 --> 225.489
just say a lot of needs were fulfilled

219.379 --> 228.319
yesterday not sexual right away but just

225.489 --> 230.359
was great being a guy a man in the house

228.319 --> 232.19
her daughter really took a like for me

230.359 --> 235.28
which he normally doesn't do with guys

232.19 --> 241.4
so I was really impressed and honored

235.28 --> 243.56
and like I even fed her pieces of

241.4 --> 245.69
cucumber and she never takes any food

243.56 --> 250.97
from anyone except your mother so it was

245.69 --> 254.78
like I didn't even know that explain why

250.97 --> 257.03
she couldn't talk well she was she's not

254.78 --> 259.039
even 2 years old so she could say things

257.03 --> 261.59
she could she called my name and she

259.039 --> 263.349
would even put a little drama in it and

261.59 --> 266.92999999999995
everything yeah she's just really young

263.349 --> 269.78
but the thing that stood out for me is

266.93 --> 273.11
that she was literally trying to start

269.78 --> 276.88899999999995
up complex conversations at times she

273.11 --> 279.349
couldn't get there yet and that that

276.889 --> 286.34000000000003
touches upon a feeling that I recognized

279.349 --> 289.31
that I haven't felt in 33 years because

286.34 --> 292.28
I had that I didn't start

289.31 --> 295.159
I basically muted myself up until I

292.28 --> 296.75
could literally make those sentences and

295.159 --> 298.18
she's just trying it out because she's

296.75 --> 300.1
not embarrassed

298.18 --> 302.56
I was embarrassed and I'm just feeling

300.1 --> 307.0
it I'm just seeing wow this is a really

302.56 --> 308.949
smart kid for the average and it's not

307.0 --> 312.699
surprising because her mother is really

308.949 --> 317.05
smart and the guy even though he is kind

312.699 --> 319.6
of has very serious emotional issues not

317.05 --> 324.91
even gonna go into that he's also smart

319.6 --> 328.6
it's like the typical setting smart with

324.91 --> 332.02000000000004
very messed up social structure and

328.6 --> 335.62
discipline basically the intelligence is

332.02 --> 340.169
then utilized by the demon that

335.62 --> 348.12
possesses him and he constantly it's I

340.169 --> 350.43
don't know I've never even met him so

348.12 --> 352.389
I'm curious to meet him though

350.43 --> 354.19
apparently he doesn't really miss

352.389 --> 358.90000000000003
behavior when other men are around which

354.19 --> 365.53
is doesn't make me like him anymore if

358.9 --> 367.51
you know what I mean yeah anyway it was

365.53 --> 370.27
great being there I did some garden work

367.51 --> 376.32
I played with the kid I showed her how

370.27 --> 377.68
to build sandcastles which was fun and

376.32 --> 383.68
what else

377.68 --> 385.74
oh yeah helped helped her with the

383.68 --> 388.449
computer cleaning it up and all that

385.74 --> 391.66
it's second nature to me she's not all

388.449 --> 393.49
that great at it and was just a great

391.66 --> 397.09000000000003
day did a lot of good things she was

393.49 --> 399.82
really happy about it and I was a bit

397.09 --> 402.01
emotional at one point even like she

399.82 --> 405.31
yeah the daughter was going to bed and

402.01 --> 408.19
she was like I really like you like in

405.31 --> 412.57
their eyes and I felt like I don't want

408.19 --> 416.02
to go away I don't want to leave I can't

412.57 --> 421.09
just get all crazy like that

416.02 --> 423.789
so I did sure I'm very open with with my

421.09 --> 426.25
friend we had a relationship in the past

423.789 --> 429.75
and it's just didn't work out back then

426.25 --> 429.75
and I don't know

434.51 --> 442.14
yeah they lie or hide indeed it is their

437.52 --> 448.07
innocence but there's also I can feel

442.14 --> 452.03999999999996
the dreams I can feel them because

448.07 --> 454.53
they're so oh all the dreams are out in

452.04 --> 457.23
the open she doesn't have any distrust

454.53 --> 460.03999999999996
so she's just opening up her senses

457.23 --> 464.67
completely or at least in my presence

460.04 --> 468.39000000000004
she just and even though I don't see him

464.67 --> 471.21000000000004
I can feel it I can feel that there's

468.39 --> 474.74
something happening in her mind I don't

471.21 --> 478.32
know what I can feel it and it's

474.74 --> 482.82
absolutely fascinating and and not every

478.32 --> 485.15999999999997
kid has that or not a lot you know you

482.82 --> 487.05
can feel always can feel well yeah when

485.16 --> 490.41
there's stuff going on with kids and one

487.05 --> 492.81
or whatever they're doing but like the

490.41 --> 494.94
really potentially smart ones and

492.81 --> 497.31
they're rather complex dreams

494.94 --> 498.84
there's just something extra about it

497.31 --> 501.06
and a lot of people don't even take

498.84 --> 504.04999999999995
notice of that they don't understand

501.06 --> 507.42
that there is complex processes going on

504.05 --> 510.23
but I can feel it and I recognize it

507.42 --> 510.23
because I had that

522.05 --> 529.6999999999999
hmm okay that's interesting math date

524.63 --> 531.47
Mathias you're walking witness those

603.2 --> 612.08

609.29 --> 616.13
yesterday and I'm still kind of dreaming

612.08 --> 618.9200000000001
on about it it by the way the entire

616.13 --> 626.96
trip there was quite an adventure this

618.92 --> 629.66
is silly and it it really was an intense

626.96 --> 631.52
day it's not that apparent but I'll try

629.66 --> 635.18
to explain it without boring y'all to

631.52 --> 639.89
death but basically when I went there at

635.18 --> 643.04
some point 3/4 of the way the train had

639.89 --> 645.05
an issue and we had to like the yeah it

643.04 --> 649.4
stops it couldn't proceed and we had to

645.05 --> 652.52
change trains and then suddenly I was

649.4 --> 654.74
gonna call a friend like hey hello yeah

652.52 --> 658.0699999999999
there's an issue and then I noticed that

654.74 --> 661.25
my phone was apparently somehow turned

658.07 --> 663.8000000000001
off and I won't turn it on again and I

661.25 --> 667.22
had to fill in a code and I didn't have

663.8 --> 670.6099999999999
that code and I didn't have any phone

667.22 --> 673.19
numbers on paper so it was screwed

670.61 --> 675.0500000000001
because also on my phone was the text

673.19 --> 682.12
message with the description on how to

675.05 --> 685.4499999999999
get to her house so yeah that sucks

682.12 --> 690.23
but I actually fixed it it was amazing

685.45 --> 692.51
what I did I went to this information

690.23 --> 696.23
person from the NS from the train

692.51 --> 698.63
station just this woman sitting there in

696.23 --> 701.27
small box and asked her like can you

698.63 --> 703.9399999999999
help me find telephone number because I

701.27 --> 706.46
dunno the company of my stepmom which is

703.94 --> 708.98
very findable on the Internet so I said

706.46 --> 711.62
ok just look for this name get the

708.98 --> 715.1
telephone number because then I can call

711.62 --> 716.96
my dad and she went all with it she

715.1 --> 718.46
really helped me out I was surprised

716.96 --> 720.44
that she was gonna complain like yeah

718.46 --> 723.32
sorry we're not supposed to do that but

720.44 --> 724.5200000000001
she went she helped me fall out really

723.32 --> 730.22
nice lady

724.52 --> 734.06
yeah my compliments at the central train

730.22 --> 738.08
station in name is the the woman sitting

734.06 --> 743.81
there in the information help station is

738.08 --> 746.33
really nice lady so anyway yeah found my

743.81 --> 749.209
through her internet found my my dad's

746.33 --> 751.88
phone number eventually called him then

749.209 --> 756.92
he found a telephone number of my friend

751.88 --> 759.05
and then oh yeah by the way also the

756.92 --> 762.649
address so that way

759.05 --> 768.1999999999999
I well back a fourth

762.649 --> 771.02
it was able to find the directions yeah

768.2 --> 773.2700000000001
what was it yeah I got her phone number

771.02 --> 775.37
through my dad then called her up again

773.27 --> 778.79
through the same telephone thingy and

775.37 --> 781.16
yeah anyway it got there but yeah it

778.79 --> 783.3199999999999
seemed like it was gonna get a disaster

781.16 --> 785.8389999999999
his day a lot of pressure on it but it

783.32 --> 788.2700000000001
worked out just great absolutely great

785.839 --> 792.86
nothing really went wrong and I didn't

788.27 --> 795.8
really panic either I got a nerved like

792.86 --> 797.87
oh no what am I gonna do I hope this is

795.8 --> 801.52
gonna work out but I didn't really panic

797.87 --> 805.399
so yeah sorry I tried not to bore you

801.52 --> 807.62
probably didn't succeed anyway it was an

805.399 --> 811.48
exciting day overall it was pretty warm

807.62 --> 816.55
but not as warm as the day before and

811.48 --> 816.5500000000001
all you know it was just nice

818.57 --> 823.07
so yeah a lot has been going on in

820.76 --> 825.83
YouTube but I literally didn't get to

823.07 --> 830.1800000000001
see a single video after I came back I

825.83 --> 832.58
just oh when I came back my computer's

830.18 --> 834.29
refused to start up so I actually

832.58 --> 836.9000000000001
thought for a moment that it was broken

834.29 --> 841.01
I didn't get it at all it got stuck in

836.9 --> 843.02
the startup like in the in the first

841.01 --> 845.45
screen of the motherboard it just got

843.02 --> 848.54
stuck there and I was like what hell is

845.45 --> 851.3900000000001
this like that doesn't even happen with

848.54 --> 854.0
my heart with my SSD which sometimes get

851.39 --> 856.43
frozen and then the hardest basically

854.0 --> 858.62
can't start up no it just froze I was

856.43 --> 864.9399999999999
like oh my god no not the motherboard

858.62 --> 868.22
please please not my computer also what

864.94 --> 871.1600000000001
just turn it off it's really nice to my

868.22 --> 872.8100000000001
computer I think I actually prayed for a

871.16 --> 877.91
moment then turned it on again and it

872.81 --> 881.9899999999999
works fine so weird day but exciting and

877.91 --> 890.66
everything came oh yeah was alright in

881.99 --> 894.62
the end so I missed a lot and nothing

890.66 --> 898.61
James Mason says probably I saw there

894.62 --> 903.59
was a chitchat on rant ease between spur

898.61 --> 905.26
scheme oh right hand and sleeping word I

903.59 --> 909.38
have no idea

905.26 --> 913.73
so was it interesting was it a total

909.38 --> 915.53
[ __ ] show like I'd expect it to be with

913.73 --> 918.41
right to hand there and spur scheme or

915.53 --> 920.93
doing his thing and I have no idea what

918.41 --> 922.9699999999999
it was like so I have can can't add

920.93 --> 926.18
anything to it really oh yeah by the way

922.97 --> 930.07
I got the coffee and some very cold

926.18 --> 930.0699999999999
water that's it

933.54 --> 939.0999999999999
okay most frustrating chapter Lissa to

936.4 --> 941.62
ever according to Daniel why is that

939.1 --> 944.5
where they over talking one another all

941.62 --> 946.74
the time were what was frustrating about

944.5 --> 946.74
it

962.3 --> 967.99
all right

964.63 --> 972.13
well I presume that Spurs chemo did what

967.99 --> 976.42
he always did and just have his fake

972.13 --> 978.67
barely an explanation mystery approach

976.42 --> 980.829
to the whole issue and not really

978.67 --> 983.11
resolve anything and basically keep on

980.829 --> 985.2589999999999
repeating the record player when it

983.11 --> 988.089
comes down to the critical questions

985.259 --> 990.069
right to hand probably red herring the

988.089 --> 991.72
[ __ ] out of everything and trying to

990.069 --> 993.8499999999999
make everything about what he's most

991.72 --> 996.8190000000001
interesting in really quickly probably

993.85 --> 1000.24
got very pissed to some people down down

996.819 --> 1002.209
talking to them potentially enrage even

1000.24 --> 1005.339
I have no idea maybe he kept his cool

1002.209 --> 1011.2399999999999
slightly and was only just a regular

1005.339 --> 1015.4200000000001
dick and I think that Riley probably was

1011.24 --> 1018.3
just waiting his moment and then as soon

1015.42 --> 1021.269
as he got time to speak he'd probably

1018.3 --> 1026.25
take a very long time but did it very

1021.269 --> 1028.5
eloquently maybe he got interrupted at

1026.25 --> 1031.079
some point and then he might have gotten

1028.5 --> 1033.449
like a bit heard in his feelings that

1031.079 --> 1037.339
might have happened I don't know this is

1033.449 --> 1037.3390000000002
all pure character based speculation

1043.459 --> 1055.3500000000001
right yeah Lord sloth of all right the

1047.579 --> 1062.1
hand seems to be just impatient and also

1055.35 --> 1065.28
he's he's he's too rushed he's impatient

1062.1 --> 1068.07
too rushed and has general obsessive

1065.28 --> 1072.96
tendencies which is not good because

1068.07 --> 1074.4289999999999
obsession actually neutralizes oversight

1072.96 --> 1076.38
by default

1074.429 --> 1080.64
that's what happens when obsession

1076.38 --> 1084.99
impulses arrive it kind of deflects the

1080.64 --> 1090.0490000000002
open sight you normally contain it's a

1084.99 --> 1090.049
big problem and I think he has it

1100.8 --> 1104.21
there is bad

1112.99 --> 1121.38
oh right ha yeah I heard about that just

1119.169 --> 1125.679
the influence of certain frequencies

1121.38 --> 1126.8700000000001
well the old tube televisions definitely

1125.679 --> 1130.3200000000002
had that effect

1126.87 --> 1133.2099999999998
there was even tested you remember with

1130.32 --> 1135.309
Alex Jones used to talk about that like

1133.21 --> 1139.3600000000001
secret facilities with thousands of

1135.309 --> 1141.4289999999999
monkeys just being seated in front of

1139.36 --> 1143.7299999999998
blinking television screens and [ __ ]

1141.429 --> 1146.5590000000002
that was weird

1143.73 --> 1148.48
but that's the old that's not the modern

1146.559 --> 1152.11
monitors I don't think they have the

1148.48 --> 1154.6
same effect I think what does happen

1152.11 --> 1156.1299999999999
though is with the miniature screens the

1154.6 --> 1162.07
super-high resolution

1156.13 --> 1164.5800000000002
it burdens the eye prosody the optical

1162.07 --> 1170.95
processing information part of the brain

1164.58 --> 1174.4189999999999
which can cause like yeah damage over

1170.95 --> 1174.419
time that does happen

1176.96 --> 1181.76
but that has to do with that it's a

1179.42 --> 1184.19
naturally fine resolution and that if

1181.76 --> 1186.61
you keep staring at that that's actually

1184.19 --> 1192.14
very bad for your optical processing

1186.61 --> 1197.4799999999998
brain part but as far as direct

1192.14 --> 1200.45
radiation effects no look the what is it

1197.48 --> 1202.73
the LCD the plasma type screen the

1200.45 --> 1204.8600000000001
modern screen with the fluid or you can

1202.73 --> 1208.16
actually push on the screen without

1204.86 --> 1210.35
issues too much that doesn't have that

1208.16 --> 1213.95
the liquid crystals which that is

1210.35 --> 1217.9399999999998
basically comprised off don't give off

1213.95 --> 1221.78
radiation I think it really was the old

1217.94 --> 1223.88
television system where they I guess you

1221.78 --> 1232.7
know fired electrons they say or

1223.88 --> 1238.2700000000002
basically used high voltage electricity

1232.7 --> 1241.7
pulses and yeah that kind of thing can

1238.27 --> 1243.85
definitely cause side effects high

1241.7 --> 1246.95
energies can cause side effects

1243.85 --> 1251.78
radiation effects things that will that

1246.95 --> 1256.8700000000001
can influence the physiology of cellular

1251.78 --> 1259.55
cellular material magnetic fields

1256.87 --> 1263.26
magnetic fields now right

1259.55 --> 1267.08
well that's electricity in general but

1263.26 --> 1270.95
look that's the television screen

1267.08 --> 1274.6399999999999
no that is more cables just electric

1270.95 --> 1279.19
fields from active like if you have a

1274.64 --> 1281.3600000000001
big cable with some serious industrial

1279.19 --> 1284.0900000000001
equipment attached to it that's like

1281.36 --> 1286.76
juicing it up really badly really heavy

1284.09 --> 1289.52
a lot of juice electricity is going

1286.76 --> 1292.31
through that cable yeah if you're like

1289.52 --> 1293.96
gonna sleep on top of that cable even

1292.31 --> 1297.76
though it would be electrically secured

1293.96 --> 1300.8
you'll damn well notice it because

1297.76 --> 1303.3799999999999
running electricity also the masts that

1300.8 --> 1307.94
in some places are used to connect the

1303.38 --> 1310.2700000000002
electrical net that had that has an

1307.94 --> 1313.73
influence measurably

1310.27 --> 1316.25
you know you can even catch electricity

1313.73 --> 1319.31
from the air over a distance in the

1316.25 --> 1323.18
vicinity of electrical masts I've done

1319.31 --> 1326.72
that I've tested it out I had a what a

1323.18 --> 1329.0900000000001
self-made crystal battery that in normal

1326.72 --> 1331.52
region would barely register anything

1329.09 --> 1334.6399999999999
then when I walked under an electrical

1331.52 --> 1337.4
mast it would subtly spike up very

1334.64 --> 1341.1100000000001
significantly like three to four times

1337.4 --> 1344.42
the amount so yeah

1341.11 --> 1347.2099999999998
however that is caused this is clearly a

1344.42 --> 1350.15
direct electrical influence of some kind

1347.21 --> 1353.99
in the vicinity of electrical masts so

1350.15 --> 1357.14
but those are heavy electrical it's

1353.99 --> 1360.41
pretty high voltage that has the look

1357.14 --> 1362.63
the higher the voltage the more the

1360.41 --> 1366.3500000000001
higher the basic magnetic field and its

1362.63 --> 1369.2600000000002
influence that's more Tesla high voltage

1366.35 --> 1371.4499999999998
it basically super wide reach it's

1369.26 --> 1377.21
actually beneficial and the lowered the

1371.45 --> 1380.14
voltage the more negative the effect

1377.21 --> 1380.14
basically becomes

1385.17 --> 1391.4
[Music]

1387.25 --> 1395.15
look more colored I don't I don't see

1391.4 --> 1397.64
why there would be a screen that did

1395.15 --> 1400.88
that look if they wanted some kind of

1397.64 --> 1403.5200000000002
electromagnetic pulse influence they put

1400.88 --> 1406.6000000000001
a piece of freaking metal in there maybe

1403.52 --> 1410.68
even behind the plastic and just like

1406.6 --> 1414.26
activating an ionizing thing to do it

1410.68 --> 1416.5700000000002
that's nothing to do with the technology

1414.26 --> 1423.17
of the screen or anything if they wanted

1416.57 --> 1427.73
impulse what a patent a patent rights a

1423.17 --> 1431.0600000000002
patents okay yeah there are patents for

1427.73 --> 1433.07
the most insane type of evil

1431.06 --> 1435.59
technologies you could imagine in the

1433.07 --> 1438.35
most bizarre regions you can make a

1435.59 --> 1442.79
deathtrap out of anything that's

1438.35 --> 1445.82
basically well what you could establish

1442.79 --> 1451.25
if you wanted to but that doesn't mean

1445.82 --> 1453.6499999999999
that is going to be applied if you want

1451.25 --> 1456.8
to do that you actually have to get the

1453.65 --> 1464.3000000000002
device disassemble it and then prove

1456.8 --> 1466.61
it's there so you know just because they

1464.3 --> 1469.79
have a technology patent doesn't mean

1466.61 --> 1473.78
that they're gonna always use that look

1469.79 --> 1476.51
it could even be applied in a way where

1473.78 --> 1482.84
regular phones wouldn't have it but they

1476.51 --> 1485.18
have a special phone design for secret

1482.84 --> 1486.83
service operations where it would have

1485.18 --> 1489.14
that and you couldn't see the difference

1486.83 --> 1492.11
between a normal phone now that is an

1489.14 --> 1495.1100000000001
understandable application okay but it's

1492.11 --> 1496.6399999999999
not gonna be in every freakin phone you

1495.11 --> 1498.56
know it's a disaster waiting to happen

1496.64 --> 1500.24
if that happens because some weirdo

1498.56 --> 1502.04
hacker could figure it out being and

1500.24 --> 1505.49
getting in bad mood and then just kill

1502.04 --> 1510.3799999999999
thousands of people it's ridiculous it's

1505.49 --> 1512.59
something gonna be there by default you

1510.38 --> 1512.5900000000001
know

1513.97 --> 1521.929
right sure if you can point to the

1519.98 --> 1524.539
amount the actual cases where it's

1521.929 --> 1528.0800000000002
provably been applied and people died

1524.539 --> 1529.549
from that then yeah please inform me

1528.08 --> 1531.59
about it because I've never heard of

1529.549 --> 1536.45
that I know there's a lot of devices

1531.59 --> 1539.48
there's like heart the heart attack

1536.45 --> 1542.6000000000001
inducing lasers over distance and that

1539.48 --> 1547.039
kind of [ __ ] so there's all kinds of

1542.6 --> 1551.2099999999998
killing ways you know it's why would

1547.039 --> 1554.809
they need it it really sounds that even

1551.21 --> 1557.179
if they could they'd rather have the

1554.809 --> 1559.82
idea out there than actually do it

1557.179 --> 1562.549
because of legal issues the idea was out

1559.82 --> 1564.2
there that it could be done and a lot of

1562.549 --> 1567.679
conspiracy theorists are gonna get very

1564.2 --> 1571.059
exciting and fear them even more and

1567.679 --> 1574.8500000000001
with some people they'll make them hate

1571.059 --> 1578.09
that group and with other people they're

1574.85 --> 1580.58
going to be very suck up to them and be

1578.09 --> 1584.72
even more groveling so they'll always

1580.58 --> 1588.32
have somebody some use for it for their

1584.72 --> 1590.929
minions as it were so that's how you got

1588.32 --> 1594.1689999999999
to see it is it real or is it a

1590.929 --> 1598.94
conspiracy theory they put out there to

1594.169 --> 1600.7990000000002
claim more dark fake authority and in

1598.94 --> 1602.8990000000001
the meantime drive the regular people

1600.799 --> 1605.539
nuts about things that aren't really

1602.899 --> 1608.0
real while at the same time actual real

1605.539 --> 1610.039
things do happen but because the

1608.0 --> 1611.539
percentage of people are distracted by

1610.039 --> 1616.07
the other thing that's not real they're

1611.539 --> 1621.289
not they might actually lose momentum in

1616.07 --> 1623.269
stopping the real thing so yeah so just

1621.289 --> 1625.899
a lot of hearsay I'm hearing from you

1623.269 --> 1625.8990000000001
guys so

1638.94 --> 1647.46
no look where is it I just told you

1643.309 --> 1650.879
phone disassemble it show where it is if

1647.46 --> 1654.269
it's just a patent the company has that

1650.879 --> 1657.2099999999998
means nothing okay that's what I just

1654.269 --> 1660.119
explained so I'm not in denial I'm

1657.21 --> 1666.769
basically as saying look if you really

1660.119 --> 1666.769
think that is real then prove it

1673.02 --> 1675.65
yeah

1678.66 --> 1682.26
yeah

1680.58 --> 1684.8899999999999
yeah do something like that again in

1682.26 --> 1688.89
your band nobody talks to me like that

1684.89 --> 1690.93
absolutely [ __ ] it's critical

1688.89 --> 1694.64
thought that I'm basically trying to

1690.93 --> 1694.64
make rub off on you guys

1705.02 --> 1712.58
yeah discernment is the ability to

1707.95 --> 1716.3300000000002
distinguish to the level discernment

1712.58 --> 1719.12
allows you to see something for the

1716.33 --> 1721.6299999999999
actual widespread priority and

1719.12 --> 1724.309
importance that it has in relation to

1721.63 --> 1727.5100000000002
insignificant non important things

1724.309 --> 1727.51
that's discernment

1744.5 --> 1752.21
so look you guys been talking about that

1750.27 --> 1758.1299999999999
for like five minutes

1752.21 --> 1762.02
so where is it where's this proof I want

1758.13 --> 1765.3000000000002
to see the proof of this claim that you

1762.02 --> 1767.07
even complain towards me about that I'm

1765.3 --> 1769.29
so silly for not believing it because

1767.07 --> 1772.71
it's established fact so where's the

1769.29 --> 1780.24
fact okay you're gonna make the claim

1772.71 --> 1784.73
now you're gonna present the evidence so

1780.24 --> 1791.48
yeah any kind of link any kind of

1784.73 --> 1794.82
relevant website video would be good and

1791.48 --> 1796.89
with that I mean not the Paton because I

1794.82 --> 1800.01
believe that Payton should be there no

1796.89 --> 1804.74
actually the proof that it is applied in

1800.01 --> 1804.74
regular devices please

1812.86 --> 1819.1299999999999
alright by the way I am open for guests

1826.809 --> 1836.53
maybe dejan will come on Ben Adams say

1833.63 --> 1836.5300000000002
hello to me this morning

1839.76 --> 1848.43
so yeah if you want to get on the show

1843.59 --> 1850.26
contact me on skype the yeah the address

1848.43 --> 1852.8100000000002
is in the description box below in

1850.26 --> 1858.36
YouTube's the first line the description

1852.81 --> 1864.6599999999999
and add me and then we can talk and you

1858.36 --> 1866.9099999999999
could be part of my show and if you've

1864.66 --> 1871.88
added me already then just say hello oh

1866.91 --> 1871.88
hey that's been Adams calling alright

1873.44 --> 1887.51
hello hear me yes I do

1884.54 --> 1898.97
cool all right yeah I'm just working on

1887.51 --> 1910.52
the representation here he's drifting a

1898.97 --> 1913.96
lot outside of the earth ah you have to

1910.52 --> 1913.96
remind me again there's been a heat wave

1916.99 --> 1923.9
nights been hot up until today pretty

1919.94 --> 1926.78
much so I've had a good night's sleep

1923.9 --> 1937.16
for the first time in in a week so you

1926.78 --> 1941.1499999999999
have to remind me again was very very it

1937.16 --> 1943.28
wasn't my daughter though oh no no no

1941.15 --> 1949.22
but it did feel like it would have been

1943.28 --> 1953.05
fun it was incredible but it's not my

1949.22 --> 1956.42
daughter it I'm kind of jealous that

1953.05 --> 1960.29
it's because the guy who is your father

1956.42 --> 1961.94
is kind of a dick you know the good

1960.29 --> 1964.85
thing is that is extremely easy to make

1961.94 --> 1968.54
it really really and it's fun it's not

1964.85 --> 1970.9399999999998
so no it's not easy to make kids at all

1968.54 --> 1975.44
or at least yeah you can make the kid

1970.94 --> 1978.8300000000002
but to then proceed to yeah give a life

1975.44 --> 1981.68
to it without everything exploding and

1978.83 --> 1983.6299999999999
[ __ ] and getting caught up in permanent

1981.68 --> 1987.3500000000001
fights the rest of your life that's not

1983.63 --> 1994.0700000000002
so easy yeah you need to find the right

1987.35 --> 1996.6499999999999
woman I agree with you yeah you've got

1994.07 --> 2001.12
good women out there you know you need

1996.65 --> 2005.0500000000002
to find the right one yeah good it's

2001.12 --> 2006.1599999999999
good for what or for who I have specific

2005.05 --> 2007.8999999999999
needs women

2006.16 --> 2009.8200000000002
I just don't think any differently than

2007.9 --> 2012.73
you they want the family they want kids

2009.82 --> 2016.21
they know after your money genuine

2012.73 --> 2018.28
people just trying to you know make a

2016.21 --> 2020.38
make me make a life for themselves and

2018.28 --> 2024.82
then create something you've got girls

2020.38 --> 2030.72
like that I mean I fought one I'm sure

2024.82 --> 2030.72
there was there must be another one oh I

2031.2 --> 2039.66
see sorry I'm trying to fix my my volume

2035.95 --> 2039.66
here there's probably some echoes again

2040.59 --> 2050.0499999999997
it's always a mess here with did the Oh

2043.99 --> 2055.72
Bryce audio but sorry no no no I'm not

2050.05 --> 2057.8500000000004
getting an echo sorry now I'm just

2055.72 --> 2060.6099999999997
saying I'm not getting an echo through

2057.85 --> 2065.49
you it's just that the OBS is not

2060.61 --> 2069.07
managing the sound very well that's all

2065.49 --> 2072.669
last time part of this video was just

2069.07 --> 2073.929
inaudible because of of the equity was

2072.669 --> 2076.149
on the channel I don't know what

2073.929 --> 2078.04
happened I'm only exclusively on on

2076.149 --> 2082.48
skype I don't even I don't even have

2078.04 --> 2084.19
your video on actually I know it's an

2082.48 --> 2085.679
internal issue there's nothing you can

2084.19 --> 2089.02
do about it unfortunately

2085.679 --> 2092.25
I'd have to upgrade my audio system I

2089.02 --> 2094.72
tried audio banana it didn't work out

2092.25 --> 2097.24
never really got to continue from that

2094.72 --> 2101.23
point on and I'm just trying to manage

2097.24 --> 2103.6299999999997
here with OBS but sometimes it gives

2101.23 --> 2105.43
this echo not all the time by the way

2103.63 --> 2108.4
which is weird sometimes it doesn't give

2105.43 --> 2113.8599999999997
an echo at all and then it suddenly does

2108.4 --> 2115.33
and the next time we're so now I'm

2113.86 --> 2118.8700000000003
getting an echo from you know I've just

2115.33 --> 2124.42
turned on the thing to check if my voice

2118.87 --> 2126.25
was echoing or not yeah that's kind of

2124.42 --> 2132.14
Lucas if you want to try that out you

2126.25 --> 2136.34
need headphones okay

2132.14 --> 2139.25
listen up stop the video yeah if you

2136.34 --> 2143.81
wanna track you need yeah I'll stop the

2139.25 --> 2144.91
video alright anyway what are we talking

2143.81 --> 2155.63
about

2144.91 --> 2157.93
yeah moving away from the hmm sorry okay

2155.63 --> 2157.9300000000003
hear me

2160.14 --> 2168.18
Arwen yes are you dead

2163.14 --> 2174.74
yes can you hear me hello can you hear

2168.18 --> 2178.1699999999996
me can you hear me okay

2174.74 --> 2217.29
hello right I'm gonna recall you because

2178.17 --> 2223.23
the sounds for some reason okay I think

2217.29 --> 2225.0299999999997
Ben Adams maybe maybe has experiencing

2223.23 --> 2227.4
some internet issues

2225.03 --> 2238.32
I'll try again later or see if he calls

2227.4 --> 2241.05
back alright yeah why did I do that well

2238.32 --> 2243.48
because he tried to post it and I saw it

2241.05 --> 2246.17
and then he deleted it immediately and I

2243.48 --> 2246.17
don't like that

2258.41 --> 2264.5099999999998
all right

2260.07 --> 2266.2200000000003
he asked me if I'm a flat earther and I

2264.51 --> 2268.0800000000004
don't know why you would just delete

2266.22 --> 2271.23
that yes I am

2268.08 --> 2276.15
have you read the title of the show

2271.23 --> 2287.52
perhaps all right my volume yep sorry

2276.15 --> 2291.98
guys what oh my god that stupid thing

2287.52 --> 2291.98
again all right

2292.82 --> 2302.9900000000002
the sound settings were reset again so

2300.45 --> 2302.99
is this better

2305.71 --> 2308.7690000000002
[Music]

2310.319 --> 2323.699
I don't know why the volume doesn't go

2315.269 --> 2325.589
higher than this I'd have no idea what

2323.699 --> 2328.789
does it matter more coloured why do you

2325.589 --> 2328.7889999999998
want to know my operating system

2337.64 --> 2362.0589999999997
[Music]

2356.619 --> 2364.42
okay seems like it's not entirely dumb

2362.059 --> 2364.42
yet

2378.49 --> 2386.5299999999997
yeah yeah I know Lord's loveable

2381.52 --> 2390.58
thanks again I don't know why but when I

2386.53 --> 2395.5
looked at the audio my microphone volume

2390.58 --> 2398.58
was back to zero again I don't know how

2395.5 --> 2398.58
this keeps on happening

2407.01 --> 2417.0
oh right no well yes thanks for the

2413.67 --> 2419.55
offer if it was too rare if you were

2417.0 --> 2422.76
referencing to trying to help me get

2419.55 --> 2428.4
audio banana working that I would really

2422.76 --> 2430.8300000000004
appreciate that sorry for being I have a

2428.4 --> 2433.2000000000003
standard distrust every time somebody

2430.83 --> 2436.77
asks me about details about my computer

2433.2 --> 2439.56
sometimes people ask like random people

2436.77 --> 2441.27
ask when I'm in other chats that kind of

2439.56 --> 2445.02
thing and it just feels like there's a

2441.27 --> 2447.6
BOTS probing me I just don't like it

2445.02 --> 2452.88
when people ask me for specifications of

2447.6 --> 2457.3199999999997
what my software or anything right it's

2452.88 --> 2460.53
silly yeah I am a little stressed not

2457.32 --> 2462.21
too much though but yeah if you want to

2460.53 --> 2465.69
try to help me out

2462.21 --> 2470.88
with getting that to work then add me on

2465.69 --> 2473.869
skype that's really the way to do it so

2470.88 --> 2473.869
thanks for the offer

2482.94 --> 2485.69
hmm

2485.77 --> 2491.619
our goodie girls stand back that's

2488.41 --> 2495.85
typical scientists have officially said

2491.619 --> 2497.98
new Isaac Newton was wrong well not know

2495.85 --> 2500.14
yeah it's all depends on what their they

2497.98 --> 2503.86
are what are they gonna do with with

2500.14 --> 2505.2999999999997
Einstein because hey can't get more

2503.86 --> 2508.42
wrong than he was

2505.3 --> 2512.8
it was just pure speculation about

2508.42 --> 2515.86
things that could never be so where do

2512.8 --> 2518.5600000000004
you go from there oh by the way that was

2515.86 --> 2520.75
kind of funny though I have this morning

2518.56 --> 2524.19
I was watching a Big Bang Theory again

2520.75 --> 2528.1
and at some point there was like physics

2524.19 --> 2530.05
lesson from Sheldon and it was

2528.1 --> 2537.58
fascinating because at some point they

2530.05 --> 2540.13
actually discussed how Newton bypassed

2537.58 --> 2542.65
an original law it was a piece of

2540.13 --> 2544.09
physics history that was actually

2542.65 --> 2548.02
interesting I think

2544.09 --> 2552.28
Aristotle like Newton bypass Aristotle

2548.02 --> 2555.0099999999998
by claiming gravity as the non-causal

2552.28 --> 2556.96
force or whatever I can't explain it

2555.01 --> 2558.9100000000003
technically the way he did it i don't

2556.96 --> 2562.48
remember just saw it once but that was

2558.91 --> 2565.859
kind of funny it really makes me think

2562.48 --> 2565.859
about the whole setup

2570.319 --> 2578.49
yeah I do find the series amusing

2573.63 --> 2580.289
I really do can't help it sometimes I

2578.49 --> 2583.0789999999997
really laughed my ass off and other

2580.289 --> 2585.63
times I'm just annoyed by all the baller

2583.079 --> 2591.15
nerdiness because they are definitely

2585.63 --> 2599.4
baller nerds oh yeah the more extreme

2591.15 --> 2602.279
kind is it yeah it's an astrophysicist

2599.4 --> 2608.4
an engineer working on the Mars Lander

2602.279 --> 2610.619
and a theoretical physicist or two

2608.4 --> 2615.0190000000002
theoretical physicist that's basically

2610.619 --> 2620.6400000000003
the setup so it's like yeah you know

2615.019 --> 2625.7889999999998
baller central and they be they do think

2620.64 --> 2625.7889999999998
it out pretty well how that manifests

2628.099 --> 2635.009
it's funny because in a way in yeah I

2633.329 --> 2637.4100000000003
already said that by the way when I was

2635.009 --> 2640.829
gonna watch the series when I started it

2637.41 --> 2644.0989999999997
up that in the future it made deaf it

2640.829 --> 2647.579
could be regarded as a baller syndrome

2644.099 --> 2650.759
study where it's basically shown in in

2647.579 --> 2655.38
the form of a sitcom series set up the

2650.759 --> 2659.88
baller syndrome types how that works how

2655.38 --> 2663.089
it affects their lives and all that from

2659.88 --> 2664.7690000000002
a perspective that if you didn't know

2663.089 --> 2666.299
that you wouldn't even see and they

2664.769 --> 2668.1899999999996
would just think oh these are just nice

2666.299 --> 2672.63
nerd guys this is how they are and all

2668.19 --> 2674.2200000000003
they are into space a lot but as soon as

2672.63 --> 2676.829
you figure out that that's all nonsense

2674.22 --> 2679.859
and that's basically a weird elaborate

2676.829 --> 2686.67
social engineering program that caused

2679.859 --> 2690.0
the arrival of this type of mindset then

2686.67 --> 2692.2200000000003
it becomes like a social study piece and

2690.0 --> 2698.19
that's kind of the way I'm looking at it

2692.22 --> 2701.22
I literally try to call me yeah a geek

2698.19 --> 2703.589
at it but sometimes I just watch it and

2701.22 --> 2706.979
figure out how could a guy

2703.589 --> 2709.65
like me approach some of them and

2706.979 --> 2713.9689999999996
actually break flat earth to them how

2709.65 --> 2716.279
would that work because I am kinda well

2713.969 --> 2719.13
I could definitely talk about their

2716.279 --> 2721.14
subjects with them absolutely I even

2719.13 --> 2723.079
there's quantum mechanics Tufts I

2721.14 --> 2726.42
already recognize things it's funny I

2723.079 --> 2729.6600000000003
recognize the names and apparently

2726.42 --> 2732.259
Sheldon really loves Fineman why oh why

2729.66 --> 2735.359
would that be with his Einstein in

2732.259 --> 2737.789
conceptualization it was just it's

2735.359 --> 2740.8489999999997
really well thought out it was correct

2737.789 --> 2744.329
it's very typical it's hidden in plain

2740.849 --> 2746.969
sight and I'm just curious what how

2744.329 --> 2752.5190000000002
would that happen me getting in front of

2746.969 --> 2756.329
them and yeah of course they just try to

2752.519 --> 2758.1299999999997
mock me and then maybe you know maybe

2756.329 --> 2763.1400000000003
they just think I'd be trolling them at

2758.13 --> 2764.759
some point that probably happened I

2763.14 --> 2770.359
don't know it's silly they're not even

2764.759 --> 2770.359
real people they're their characters

2770.719 --> 2779.64
getting way too cut up in this hello

2774.749 --> 2783.93
moderators oh well moderators you mean

2779.64 --> 2786.109
me me you mean I timed you out yeah I

2783.93 --> 2786.109
did

2791.82 --> 2801.38
okay Maxwell Smart you keep on doing

2794.91 --> 2804.0899999999997
this and now you're banned don't post

2801.38 --> 2810.84
messages and then delete them that's

2804.09 --> 2813.1200000000003
really annoying post them leave them why

2810.84 --> 2816.2000000000003
because I say so

2813.12 --> 2816.2
that's why

2823.85 --> 2829.1
look I don't even remember but if you

2826.91 --> 2832.43
don't tone it down with the nonsense

2829.1 --> 2837.73
nonsense outrage I'm gonna ban you so

2832.43 --> 2840.3199999999997
cool it down okay

2837.73 --> 2842.6
supposedly you are a human being and

2840.32 --> 2844.8500000000004
being timed out is not the end of the

2842.6 --> 2848.42
world you're not gonna die from being

2844.85 --> 2856.54
timeout so stop acting like it means

2848.42 --> 2856.54
anything please hello Nathan

2862.52 --> 2865.679
[Music]

2866.359 --> 2871.0989999999997

2878.86 --> 2884.7690000000002
[Music]

2922.04 --> 2934.569
what you called me by accident

2928.94 --> 2934.569
oh wait wait you sound different story

2934.9 --> 2942.4
yeah you're on the show life yeah how

2939.68 --> 2945.5299999999997
are you doing I'm tired

2942.4 --> 2950.0
yeah so what's been happening while I

2945.53 --> 2957.369
was gone but you were gone

2950.0 --> 2957.369
how many days one oh not much just

2959.65 --> 2966.65
nothing Wow was there any ball busters

2963.53 --> 2972.65
or anything no nothing from there in a

2966.65 --> 2975.76
while no ball busters oh okay

2972.65 --> 2975.76
surprised about that

2978.22 --> 2984.9399999999996
hmm well I don't know what's going on me

2982.96 --> 2989.08
I don't know what it is what Nathan is

2984.94 --> 2991.63
doing why he's not just having the daily

2989.08 --> 2995.0699999999997
debate and why did she skipped a ball

2991.63 --> 2999.06
bus I think he may just be in a summer

2995.07 --> 3001.59
vacation mode where his wife probably

2999.06 --> 3003.63
has a vacation now and they're going

3001.59 --> 3005.1600000000003
with their kids and he just didn't tell

3003.63 --> 3007.4100000000003
anyone maybe that's it I don't know

3005.16 --> 3009.1499999999996
what's going on I think it was

3007.41 --> 3012.99
somebody's birthday and his family or

3009.15 --> 3015.03
something right so he was planning for a

3012.99 --> 3018.0299999999997
couple of days off that's why he stored

3015.03 --> 3020.1600000000003
extra episodes this week mm-hmm but I

3018.03 --> 3023.8100000000004
think he was counting on all Buster's to

3020.16 --> 3027.39
go so that might have been something on

3023.81 --> 3030.7799999999997
Kiwis and okay

3027.39 --> 3032.8199999999997
or it could be technical difficulty that

3030.78 --> 3038.9100000000003
he was gonna premiere it and didn't work

3032.82 --> 3041.04
out I don't know no dizzy the air the

3038.91 --> 3047.0
rear one of an older episode the morning

3041.04 --> 3056.54
that's that hmm

3047.0 --> 3062.14
ah a lot of trolls in chat today okay

3056.54 --> 3073.97
well I don't know what's on tonight's

3062.14 --> 3077.69
let's see okay so you know if you didn't

3073.97 --> 3085.58
talk about Nathan answered you yeah but

3077.69 --> 3089.7400000000002
he was being a dick so oh yeah Jaron is

3085.58 --> 3095.24
gonna be probably life in the evening

3089.74 --> 3096.7999999999997
it's gonna be there yeah what do you

3095.24 --> 3098.9599999999996
think I'm doing with he is the walking

3096.8 --> 3103.61
witness I am banning Charles that's why

3098.96 --> 3107.59
I banned literally five sock accounts in

3103.61 --> 3107.59
the last five minutes so

3112.73 --> 3115.69
sorry

3119.01 --> 3129.7000000000003

I don't know oh you mean my negative

3137.86 --> 3147.94
responses to just regular questions in

3140.17 --> 3149.41
chat all right oh I agree now they are

3147.94 --> 3158.14
they're kind of like paranoid

3149.41 --> 3162.91
unnecessarily I just said it no but I I

3158.14 --> 3169.48
admit that's true I sometimes it's just

3162.91 --> 3172.8999999999996
I'm kind of let me say I have a weird

3169.48 --> 3175.18
suspicion that there are people out

3172.9 --> 3177.4300000000003
there or but your people programmers

3175.18 --> 3180.19
that are literally trying to basically

3177.43 --> 3183.94
worm themselves into your social life

3180.19 --> 3186.28
with fake people that try to follow you

3183.94 --> 3188.32
and then try to manipulate and derail

3186.28 --> 3190.48
you at some point so I'm constantly

3188.32 --> 3192.9700000000003
looking in chat if somebody's gonna say

3190.48 --> 3195.55
something that just seems off and then I

3192.97 --> 3198.1299999999997
immediately just think oh [ __ ] they just

3195.55 --> 3200.23
switched that's my first response

3198.13 --> 3203.44
because I've seen it happen like in the

3200.23 --> 3204.7
earlier days with Flat Earth there were

3203.44 --> 3206.7400000000002
a lot of people like that they would

3204.7 --> 3208.3599999999997
just come and be supposedly nice and

3206.74 --> 3212.5899999999997
then they'd start trolling out of

3208.36 --> 3216.1200000000003
nowhere it was really doesn't help with

3212.59 --> 3216.1200000000003
the trust if you know what I mean right

3217.47 --> 3223.66
so I'm still with yeah a lot of people

3220.87 --> 3226.06
in my chat that I'm even kind of used to

3223.66 --> 3229.06
I just notice yeah they're nice they say

3226.06 --> 3231.52
yeah I think I get him but still in my

3229.06 --> 3234.22
mind it's like okay unless they

3231.52 --> 3236.74
literally should talk with me I hear

3234.22 --> 3238.87
their voice I see their face there is

3236.74 --> 3241.87
just a chance that they at some point

3238.87 --> 3246.71
will switch to a hostile mode for some

3241.87 --> 3250.52
ploy but if it's in your mind

3246.71 --> 3252.89
it's in your mind until the heavens and

3250.52 --> 3255.86
your mind can run with it so you gotta

3252.89 --> 3258.83
be careful I know that's why I when I

3255.86 --> 3260.9900000000002
catch myself responding to that mindset

3258.83 --> 3263.5699999999997
I have to kind of then backtrack and

3260.99 --> 3267.3999999999996
break it off before it gets worse and I

3263.57 --> 3275.4500000000003
get really paranoid about some people so

3267.4 --> 3279.23
it's nothing personal though it's just

3275.45 --> 3282.98
I've had a lot of trolls out there and

3279.23 --> 3285.08
people even in well now it's trolls back

3282.98 --> 3287.11
in the days kind of before the internet

3285.08 --> 3289.61
people did that kind of [ __ ] to my face

3287.11 --> 3296.84
they tried to trick me and I was very

3289.61 --> 3299.1200000000003
gullible on average and that's why I'm

3296.84 --> 3300.59
kind of continually paranoid because

3299.12 --> 3308.6
I've just used that there's always

3300.59 --> 3310.94
people out there trying to trick me I

3308.6 --> 3312.89
don't but it's always in the back of my

3310.94 --> 3315.14
mind it's just a fail-safe mechanism

3312.89 --> 3316.7599999999998
because if I don't then things can go

3315.14 --> 3318.89
really wrong that's just how I see it

3316.76 --> 3321.2000000000003
see it that's how if experiences you

3318.89 --> 3324.5899999999997
always got to be alert to people you

3321.2 --> 3326.96
don't definitively know they don't show

3324.59 --> 3331.55
their face if the moving if they don't

3326.96 --> 3335.21
let their voice be heard it just yeah it

3331.55 --> 3337.13
you can't then start trusting them too

3335.21 --> 3339.8
much it just can't that's my experience

3337.13 --> 3346.76
and it's nothing personal it's just I

3339.8 --> 3349.55
try to connect but I just like you said

3346.76 --> 3352.42
if they got a good sense of humor no

3349.55 --> 3352.42
problem all right

3355.5 --> 3362.52
right what's scared to chat it's not

3360.3 --> 3366.2400000000002
getting scared to chat if it's just an

3362.52 --> 3369.27
obvious sock troll that is not really

3366.24 --> 3371.8489999999997
somebody that I recognize then I'm gonna

3369.27 --> 3374.849
treat them like a troll but sometimes

3371.849 --> 3377.099
people that just hang around in my chat

3374.849 --> 3379.65
and say hello to me every day for like a

3377.099 --> 3382.6800000000003
month and it happened before like I

3379.65 --> 3384.57
think P Mars tried it out at some point

3382.68 --> 3386.19
where he when he was banned

3384.57 --> 3387.9300000000003
there's just sneak in with another

3386.19 --> 3392.93
account and then pretend like he's

3387.93 --> 3397.9199999999996
another person so that [ __ ] does happen

3392.93 --> 3400.6499999999996
and sometimes I just wonder like with

3397.92 --> 3402.9300000000003
people that just got in for maybe a

3400.65 --> 3407.869
month and they wonder like are they

3402.93 --> 3407.8689999999997
really in a separate individual or yeah

3409.52 --> 3414.54
but I think yeah I'm pretty sure more

3411.9 --> 3418.71
colored is a genuine individual he's

3414.54 --> 3422.16
very talkative in his own way so I

3418.71 --> 3431.25
shouldn't be stupid about it sorry about

3422.16 --> 3434.52
that more colored and I'm gonna run that
