130.239 --> 136.16
it's good to see that uh

133.68 --> 138.72
yeah the weather today is yeah it's not

136.16 --> 140.879
as shiny and bright as it was yesterday

138.72 --> 143.92
now instead there's

140.879 --> 147.67999999999998
whoa there's clouds up there

143.92 --> 150.79999999999998
moving really really really fast you can

147.68 --> 151.20000000000002
you can literally see it look at that

150.8 --> 156.72
that's

151.2 --> 159.04
crazy how fast it's going

156.72 --> 161.44
so yeah big clouds up there they're

159.04 --> 161.44
moving

161.92 --> 166.48
look at that just what a sight

166.64 --> 174.55999999999997
they seem really close by these clouds

170.64 --> 174.55999999999997
it's an odd sight

175.84 --> 179.28
yeah there's been it looks incredibly

178.8 --> 182.4
moist

179.28 --> 184.879
outside but as far as i know it hasn't

182.4 --> 188.239
actually rained but yeah maybe it did

184.879 --> 191.67999999999998
while i was asleep it was very

188.239 --> 195.04
misty though last night like really

191.68 --> 196.239
thick thick thick mist at some point

195.04 --> 199.599
it's always weird when that

196.239 --> 203.28
just happens suddenly

199.599 --> 204.0
really thick mist but yeah there's none

203.28 --> 206.319
of that left

204.0 --> 209.2
now it's just these giant rusty rushing

206.319 --> 209.2
clouds up there

209.28 --> 217.2
yeah anyway let's see who's in chat

214.0 --> 218.56
ryan earthing ryan eartherton's first

217.2 --> 222.64
roger

218.56 --> 225.84
freeman terret 3006 and brent m

222.64 --> 227.11999999999998
yeah good to see you all six inches of

225.84 --> 229.26
snow here

227.12 --> 231.59900000000002
huh nice i think

229.26 --> 234.319
[Music]

231.599 --> 234.319
should be nice

236.64 --> 244.23899999999998
we have i haven't seen any snow here in

240.4 --> 244.239
i think at least two years now

245.04 --> 248.879
if there is any snow at all it usually

247.04 --> 255.84
happens around my birthday

248.879 --> 255.84
in beginning of february

256.4 --> 261.03999999999996
right a man bear beardella

262.56 --> 269.84
funny name all right anyway i got green

266.16 --> 269.84000000000003
tea with me

270.16 --> 273.199
started a little late

274.639 --> 277.68
because yeah i don't know

278.479 --> 282.71999999999997
i got up quite late pretty much half an

281.68 --> 287.919
hour before the show

282.72 --> 287.91900000000004
should start try to cram everything in

291.12 --> 297.68
but yeah making late nights these nights

294.479 --> 301.52
watching some babylon 5 again

297.68 --> 304.56
and here we go again

301.52 --> 307.039
probably still asleep like she went

304.56 --> 310.32
through the the at the peak

307.039 --> 312.08
and kept it all a secret but yeah

310.32 --> 313.36
literally she had her mind blown

312.08 --> 316.479
yesterday

313.36 --> 318.40000000000003
from the series like in the peak of it

316.479 --> 319.68
and like it was pretty incredible to

318.4 --> 322.96
behold like she was

319.68 --> 326.08
really just like whoa

322.96 --> 328.57
and it's like yeah i know i

326.08 --> 330.8
remember when i first watched that too

328.57 --> 334.32
[Laughter]

330.8 --> 336.0
ah incredible stuff i haven't really

334.32 --> 338.24
gotten up to her it's like she really

336.0 --> 341.759
ducked through the whole thing

338.24 --> 341.759
or that yeah halfway

343.12 --> 347.68
i'm still working my way through season

346.88 --> 349.68
one and

347.68 --> 352.40000000000003
i'm really surprised that it's much

349.68 --> 354.56
better than i thought it was

352.4 --> 357.039
like it's really a lot better than i

354.56 --> 360.56
thought it was i don't know why

357.039 --> 363.68
i got preoccupied like

360.56 --> 365.36
with the other seasons more

363.68 --> 368.639
maybe it's because when i was younger i

365.36 --> 371.12
i like didn't like sinclair

368.639 --> 373.44
was like the main character in the first

371.12 --> 377.36
season and then he kind of drops away

373.44 --> 379.44
becomes a plot related character

377.36 --> 380.88
after that and then sheridan takes over

379.44 --> 384.4
and i always liked sheridan

380.88 --> 384.4
like the way he is like very

385.039 --> 390.88
passionate and

388.08 --> 391.52
loyal and i don't know just i like the

390.88 --> 394.71999999999997
way he

391.52 --> 398.08
is that's kind of like how i feel

394.72 --> 401.91900000000004
myself at times just

398.08 --> 405.84
confidence passion and just

401.919 --> 409.19899999999996
really sticking to principles

405.84 --> 410.479
but yeah anyway he

409.199 --> 412.56
goes through a lot of character

410.479 --> 415.75899999999996
development as

412.56 --> 417.84
the seasons move on and that also like

415.759 --> 420.56
it presents a certain dilemma as well

417.84 --> 421.52
so i always was more like yeah it's

420.56 --> 424.24
great

421.52 --> 426.24
when he comes in and in a way the story

424.24 --> 427.759
becomes a little bit more exciting as

426.24 --> 430.479
well

427.759 --> 432.0
when season two starts and all but now

430.479 --> 435.039
watching back

432.0 --> 436.8
just like wow i don't know why i didn't

435.039 --> 441.36
think this first season was

436.8 --> 445.68
all that great because it is it's great

441.36 --> 445.68
incredible hey

445.759 --> 449.599
hello here we go again watching aussie

448.24 --> 452.72
men review yeah yeah

449.599 --> 455.68
he had another summary video 2020

452.72 --> 456.24
and it is pretty funny some good clips

455.68 --> 457.84000000000003
in there

456.24 --> 459.68
i haven't watched through the whole

457.84 --> 462.84
thing yet

459.68 --> 465.759
but i knew you would probably appreciate

462.84 --> 468.0
it

465.759 --> 471.68
yeah yeah here we go this is your first

468.0 --> 473.759
watch you don't really get to see it

471.68 --> 476.08
you haven't been through the whole thing

473.759 --> 476.08000000000004
yet

477.44 --> 482.71999999999997
trust me when it's over you're going to

479.84 --> 485.599
be nostalgic as [ __ ]

482.72 --> 485.59900000000005
trust me on this

487.28 --> 491.28
but i'm not going to spoil it it's just

489.84 --> 493.44
a really well designed

491.28 --> 495.52
series and i was just surprised that

493.44 --> 498.16
season one is much better than i

495.52 --> 498.15999999999997
thought it was

501.44 --> 504.879
i know i just shared that

505.12 --> 512.4
don't go gushing around with too much

508.96 --> 512.4
don't spoil it for others

518.479 --> 526.1600000000001
anyway damn shadows you had a

522.0 --> 528.16
mental breakdown apparently yes

526.16 --> 530.399
it's weird because people have been

528.16 --> 531.519
saying that apparently that happened i

530.399 --> 534.64
never even knew that

531.519 --> 537.279
like i never even knew that ever

534.64 --> 537.279
no idea

541.92 --> 548.399
that that apparently was an influence on

544.0 --> 550.64
the series

548.399 --> 552.16
like apparently originally it was

550.64 --> 556.88
supposed to be i guess

552.16 --> 559.04
one singular captain of the babylon 5

556.88 --> 561.6
that would go through all of it but

559.04 --> 566.0799999999999
instead they kind of like split

561.6 --> 566.08
the scenario up a little

574.839 --> 577.839
effectively

578.64 --> 581.279
yeah yeah

582.8 --> 591.8389999999999
well sinclair is oh is he dead

586.08 --> 591.839
damn like the actor

593.12 --> 599.76
oh i did not know that

597.92 --> 601.519
then again i'm not typically the person

599.76 --> 602.399
that's always like oh i want to know

601.519 --> 605.12
everything

602.399 --> 606.959
every actor are they still alive how do

605.12 --> 609.2
they look now what are they really like

606.959 --> 612.0
i never really cared

609.2 --> 613.519
it's just like i care about the series

612.0 --> 618.079
as the story

613.519 --> 620.9590000000001
and the characters in it because usually

618.079 --> 621.92
i don't know man so many times that i

620.959 --> 624.079
thought oh i

621.92 --> 625.5999999999999
really like this character and then i

624.079 --> 626.16
learn what the actor is like and then

625.6 --> 628.72
i'm like

626.16 --> 630.079
damn i really don't like the actor what

628.72 --> 634.88
they're really like

630.079 --> 634.88
so i just stopped inquiring after a

644.839 --> 647.839
while

648.56 --> 654.8
you are not a real fan then no i just

651.76 --> 656.48
have a life look i watched through

654.8 --> 659.8389999999999
babylon 5

656.48 --> 662.72
like six times okay don't tell me i'm

659.839 --> 662.72
not a real fan

663.2 --> 668.5600000000001
i was fan enough to basically not spoil

666.399 --> 669.2
it for you despite talking about a lot

668.56 --> 672.2399999999999
of it

669.2 --> 676.0790000000001
while you were still watching it so i'm

672.24 --> 678.32
fan enough like i've been spreading the

676.079 --> 681.12
word about babylon 5

678.32 --> 683.7600000000001
since the 90s where everybody was still

681.12 --> 686.72
whining about star trek

683.76 --> 688.72
the deep space nine like that's any kind

686.72 --> 691.2
of competition to babylon five

688.72 --> 691.2
pathetic

692.079 --> 698.4799999999999
right okay fine

695.2 --> 700.0790000000001
yeah you know i don't get that if you're

698.48 --> 700.72
just gonna say it i'm gonna take it

700.079 --> 703.1999999999999
literal

700.72 --> 705.12
every single time i will take it literal

703.2 --> 707.6
you should know me by now

705.12 --> 709.92
i always do that always and it's not

707.6 --> 713.12
even my thing a joke i just

709.92 --> 715.4399999999999
always take it literal in the heat of

713.12 --> 718.5600000000001
the moment i do not spot sarcasm

715.44 --> 720.1600000000001
because i don't let sarcasm break the

718.56 --> 723.92
seriousness of the moment i

720.16 --> 725.76
never allow that i never allow that

723.92 --> 727.5999999999999
and it's not even because of my will

725.76 --> 729.4399999999999
it's because of instinct i just never

727.6 --> 745.839
allow it to do that

729.44 --> 745.839
never do so

747.12 --> 760.9590000000001
i wasn't being sarcastic then okay well

749.92 --> 760.959
either is fine a flat side

768.48 --> 773.839
i mentioned in the commentary huh

774.88 --> 781.12
i think yet thomannoid i think i have

778.399 --> 781.519
watched like the commentary but it was

781.12 --> 783.92
like

781.519 --> 785.92
after the whole series was over and i

783.92 --> 788.079
was so nostalgic at that point that i

785.92 --> 790.0
just didn't want to watch that anymore

788.079 --> 793.76
i just needed to forget about it because

790.0 --> 793.76
it was like this massive breakup

793.839 --> 799.12
to me because it look the series got

796.639 --> 801.92
really close to my heart

799.12 --> 802.72
really close probably the closest that

801.92 --> 805.36
any series

802.72 --> 805.36
ever had

812.56 --> 818.4799999999999
like there's very few series out there

815.279 --> 821.04
that go on for like five seasons

818.48 --> 821.76
that get just better as they age that

821.04 --> 824.56
are really

821.76 --> 825.36
ripened like a fine wine it there's no

824.56 --> 829.3599999999999
series that

825.36 --> 832.8000000000001
does that ever there isn't any

829.36 --> 837.12
it really isn't well this one is

832.8 --> 837.12
it absolutely is so yeah

840.959 --> 844.6389999999999
yes you know three season three is like

843.44 --> 847.7600000000001
the peak

844.639 --> 850.0790000000001
it's like the the big come together of

847.76 --> 852.56
it all

850.079 --> 854.399
but i think season four and five are

852.56 --> 856.3199999999999
great too

854.399 --> 859.44
like season four is pretty epic but

856.32 --> 861.6
season three is it's just that

859.44 --> 863.6
that moment where the whole thing kind

861.6 --> 866.0790000000001
of comes together from

863.6 --> 867.36
what was handed down slow the big

866.079 --> 870.959
mystery

867.36 --> 874.8000000000001
that already starts up at season one

870.959 --> 875.8389999999999
they just round that out and then after

874.8 --> 878.8
that just

875.839 --> 881.12
[ __ ] starts to go down for realsies as

878.8 --> 881.12
it were

883.839 --> 888.24
yeah the whole thing is amazing and

886.24 --> 893.92
let's not

888.24 --> 893.92
let's not get into that in detail

895.76 --> 899.6
if it get interrupted by illuminati oh

898.72 --> 903.76
terry oh

899.6 --> 907.36
yay how about his computer just crashed

903.76 --> 907.36
by the way i haven't seen nathan

909.44 --> 914.5600000000001
coming back at all it's weird

915.04 --> 918.48
it's no sign of nathan

924.56 --> 927.8389999999999
oh wait

928.16 --> 931.92
no wait what

932.24 --> 940.9590000000001
oh i do see that nathan was

935.36 --> 944.32
i think

940.959 --> 945.4399999999999
he did come on this morning over at

944.32 --> 949.9200000000001
skype so i

945.44 --> 949.9200000000001
his computer should be working at least

950.959 --> 956.2399999999999
because otherwise it wouldn't or yeah

952.72 --> 960.639
maybe went in on a tablet or something

956.24 --> 960.639
whatever happened he still has internet

960.88 --> 965.519
so let's hope that the show will just

962.72 --> 969.839
keep oh we'll just start up and go

965.519 --> 969.839
as usual

976.86 --> 979.96
[Music]

983.399 --> 987.04
appreciation society

987.68 --> 991.8389999999999
when is the next fed well it should be

991.92 --> 997.8389999999999
starting up in an hour and 10 minutes

998.0 --> 1002.41
like with the pre-show recording and

1001.279 --> 1005.5
an hour and

1002.41 --> 1005.5
[Music]

1005.519 --> 1012.24
30 seven minutes

1009.36 --> 1012.24
to the live show

1013.519 --> 1017.519
oh his pc is broken i thought

1018.399 --> 1021.92
how do you know did he tell you

1022.639 --> 1025.839
flat side

1035.919 --> 1042.0790000000002
what chocolate for breakfast why why

1038.72 --> 1042.079
would you do that that's not

1050.84 --> 1053.84
good

1054.08 --> 1057.039
because you like it

1057.52 --> 1064.8799999999999
it's not a good way to start out

1060.559 --> 1068.799
eating chocolate is just a drug

1064.88 --> 1072.88
and has influence in your system

1068.799 --> 1072.8799999999999
now won't be a show today oh [ __ ]

1073.36 --> 1081.84
no flat earth debates oh

1092.84 --> 1095.84
so

1102.559 --> 1111.039
what are we gonna do

1108.24 --> 1111.039
i don't know man

1114.72 --> 1123.84
i am coming over what

1117.76 --> 1123.84
are you talking about

1131.679 --> 1135.2800000000002
well what is wrong with it won't it

1134.0 --> 1138.08
start up

1135.28 --> 1138.96
is it giving an error on startup where

1138.08 --> 1151.84
is it giving an

1138.96 --> 1151.8400000000001
error or

1162.72 --> 1166.88
did he give any hint is it like

1164.96 --> 1169.2
literally the computer won't start up

1166.88 --> 1169.2
again

1170.32 --> 1178.32
because then probably his motherboard

1172.88 --> 1180.7990000000002
just fried or something

1178.32 --> 1181.9189999999999
in a way i would not be too surprised

1180.799 --> 1185.76
because the guy

1181.919 --> 1188.88
literally just plugs in so much stuff

1185.76 --> 1192.16
that kind of overburdens

1188.88 --> 1194.0
so like i

1192.16 --> 1197.28
never have those kind of troubles

1194.0 --> 1207.52
because my pc is just really simple

1197.28 --> 1212.24
really really simple

1207.52 --> 1212.24
four hours no no freaking way

1212.32 --> 1215.12
not a chance

1219.039 --> 1222.799
you still want to shoot that bow

1220.88 --> 1225.5200000000002
sometime but that's cute

1222.799 --> 1227.6
well you got to come over then and sure

1225.52 --> 1232.1589999999999
fine we could shoot the bow we could go

1227.6 --> 1232.1589999999999
down there in the field and shoot the

1232.84 --> 1249.84
bow

1235.84 --> 1249.84
that's fine

1252.799 --> 1256.799
really bird debate could be the start of

1256.0 --> 1260.559
something no

1256.799 --> 1261.28
no it can't really i'm not gonna do the

1260.559 --> 1264.08
same

1261.28 --> 1265.039
show format what nathan does if nathan

1264.08 --> 1267.36
gives up

1265.039 --> 1269.36
i can't do that i'm not suitable for

1267.36 --> 1271.039
that i'm suitable for sitting in front

1269.36 --> 1274.7199999999998
of a camera blabbering on

1271.039 --> 1275.2
endlessly or just eating and drinking

1274.72 --> 1277.2
tea

1275.2 --> 1278.96
and sitting there waiting for somebody

1277.2 --> 1281.679
to say something so that it might

1278.96 --> 1284.559
trigger me to become extremely inspired

1281.679 --> 1286.159
and suddenly give out concise

1284.559 --> 1289.44
concentrated

1286.159 --> 1291.919
words of wisdom about something randomly

1289.44 --> 1295.8400000000001
out of nowhere that's what i do

1291.919 --> 1299.679
okay i'm not a

1295.84 --> 1301.28
starter for me [ __ ] rumpus like i don't

1299.679 --> 1304.48
have that i don't want

1301.28 --> 1305.12
that i don't want to do that it's not my

1304.48 --> 1307.84
thing

1305.12 --> 1309.4399999999998
i appreciate it nathan does it it's not

1307.84 --> 1313.52
my thing though

1309.44 --> 1313.52
i don't have that sort of stamina

1314.0 --> 1317.36
gives me a headache to do that takes

1316.32 --> 1319.6
away

1317.36 --> 1321.9189999999999
the finer senses that i utilize for

1319.6 --> 1322.799
these special words of wisdom and his

1321.919 --> 1327.1200000000001
insights

1322.799 --> 1329.9189999999999
if i just go on an attack formation

1327.12 --> 1330.4799999999998
then yeah that's what i become it will

1329.919 --> 1334.64
become

1330.48 --> 1334.64
quite boring i'll assure you that

1334.96 --> 1339.76
and i have had my moments where i was

1337.039 --> 1342.4
very much like that

1339.76 --> 1344.0
and yeah i can do it i can do it when i

1342.4 --> 1347.039
feel like it

1344.0 --> 1349.84
it's just not something that's like

1347.039 --> 1352.1589999999999
good for me to keep on holding on to

1349.84 --> 1352.1589999999999
that

1354.24 --> 1358.0
it's not i'm not suitable for that sort

1357.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
of action

1358.0 --> 1361.84
on the long run

1367.36 --> 1369.6789999999999
what

1371.12 --> 1377.9189999999999
best part in history of feds

1375.6 --> 1377.9189999999999
what

1381.28 --> 1385.76
is that the episode where rompus got in

1384.08 --> 1387.6789999999999
like one of the longer times

1385.76 --> 1390.0
and like really started to stutter and

1387.679 --> 1392.64
all that because that was pretty epic

1390.0 --> 1393.039
and hey nathan like replayed that show

1392.64 --> 1396.64
like

1393.039 --> 1396.64
seven times in two weeks

1396.799 --> 1405.2
it was a really special show i agree

1400.08 --> 1405.1999999999998
why do clouds float uh

1406.559 --> 1409.12
because

1410.24 --> 1420.329
that's what they do

1417.13 --> 1420.3290000000002
[Music]

1442.84 --> 1445.84
hmm

1456.84 --> 1463.12
what

1459.2 --> 1465.919
nathan should premiere it daily

1463.12 --> 1467.36
well you know what it would be kind of

1465.919 --> 1470.7990000000002
fun

1467.36 --> 1471.4399999999998
maybe if he sees an opportunity to do

1470.799 --> 1473.679
that

1471.44 --> 1475.8400000000001
or not maybe doesn't care would be

1473.679 --> 1479.279
pretty cool if he had

1475.84 --> 1483.4399999999998
maybe a separate channel where just

1479.279 --> 1485.2
like the best couple of episodes

1483.44 --> 1487.2
that he can find and i know he has a

1485.2 --> 1488.88
list

1487.2 --> 1490.4
and then like dig through it and then

1488.88 --> 1493.919
just think about it like

1490.4 --> 1495.679
what would this stay fresh even

1493.919 --> 1499.1200000000001
after a lot of time passed or are there

1495.679 --> 1501.2
very outdated elements in these shows

1499.12 --> 1503.1999999999998
then put them together like the 10 or

1501.2 --> 1506.88
the 20 best

1503.2 --> 1508.24
shows and can be recently and then just

1506.88 --> 1510.4
keep it on replay

1508.24 --> 1511.76
constantly on a separate channel just

1510.4 --> 1515.8400000000001
keep on replaying

1511.76 --> 1519.12
it so there's like a i don't know

1515.84 --> 1519.12
the best of fed

1519.2 --> 1522.0800000000002
24 7.

1526.84 --> 1529.84
what

1543.12 --> 1546.2399999999998
play a list of people's first

1545.36 --> 1556.9599999999998
appearances

1546.24 --> 1561.039
really why

1556.96 --> 1561.039
that's it getting lost here in the chat

1562.72 --> 1571.84
hey elijah freeman good to see you

1580.0 --> 1585.84
all right

1586.97 --> 1593.559
[Music]

1595.84 --> 1599.84
yeah good to see you guys in here

1601.07 --> 1606.08
[Music]

1603.76 --> 1609.76
now that the fed is not gonna have a

1606.08 --> 1627.84
show everybody's filing on in my chat

1609.76 --> 1627.84
but that's okay you're all welcome here

1631.36 --> 1635.039
all right yeah michael jones yeah

1632.88 --> 1638.64
chocolate's first appearances

1635.039 --> 1640.32
it's kind of funny there's a lot of new

1638.64 --> 1643.3600000000001
people coming in back then and chocolate

1640.32 --> 1646.399
was one of them and just

1643.36 --> 1646.399
like he kind of stuck

1651.76 --> 1669.84
i hear you're hosting fed what

1655.279 --> 1669.84
am i

1673.52 --> 1677.44
okay that sounds really nice you know

1675.2 --> 1680.559
but i don't know how to start up like a

1677.44 --> 1680.559
panel and stuff so

1681.44 --> 1684.559
oh you'll be the funny will you ryan

1683.919 --> 1689.5200000000002
eartherton

1684.559 --> 1694.08
okay might be sarcasm

1689.52 --> 1699.039
right that would explain

1694.08 --> 1699.039
why i don't care if it would be

1709.36 --> 1718.08
no thanks i can act like a rumpus

1713.44 --> 1718.0800000000002
myself plenty thank you very much

1720.159 --> 1738.88
doesn't mean i will because just because

1723.279 --> 1741.6
you can does that mean you should

1738.88 --> 1745.0390000000002
here we go look brenda brenda hasn't

1741.6 --> 1746.9599999999998
been on in a long time

1745.039 --> 1750.72
ever noticed like on the flatter debate

1746.96 --> 1750.72
that's been like half a year now

1750.88 --> 1754.0800000000002
you know most of the ballers have just

1752.799 --> 1757.12
literally

1754.08 --> 1760.399
scurried away and they're now hiding in

1757.12 --> 1761.76
safer spaces where they will be allowed

1760.399 --> 1764.8799999999999
to be delusional

1761.76 --> 1767.039
a little bit better a little bit more

1764.88 --> 1769.2
that's where they're all going now

1767.039 --> 1771.6
because flat earth debates they're just

1769.2 --> 1774.159
giving up all of them

1771.6 --> 1774.799
ballers have lost they know it and they

1774.159 --> 1777.679
can't

1774.799 --> 1779.44
i guess fool themselves enough that they

1777.679 --> 1781.679
are still winning

1779.44 --> 1784.159
in order for them to come on and make an

1781.679 --> 1784.159
appearance

1790.0 --> 1794.64
it's probably all just too demoralizing

1792.72 --> 1797.039
for them

1794.64 --> 1797.76
right never going to ranty because randy

1797.039 --> 1802.0
allows

1797.76 --> 1802.0
people to be delusional

1802.47 --> 1809.84
[Music]

1805.2 --> 1809.8400000000001
that's right

1812.64 --> 1815.769
[Music]

1823.6 --> 1827.6
yeah i bet they're all there all the

1825.84 --> 1828.559
ballers that have all made the fools of

1827.6 --> 1829.9189999999999
themselves in the

1828.559 --> 1834.1589999999999
in the recent few years they're all

1829.919 --> 1834.159
there now that doesn't mean that

1834.96 --> 1838.32
that we should care because these are

1837.919 --> 1841.6000000000001
all

1838.32 --> 1844.72
fools anyway they're just going to make

1841.6 --> 1847.4399999999998
mo up more [ __ ] anyway

1844.72 --> 1850.08
that's what they will be doing for

1847.44 --> 1854.3200000000002
potentially years to come

1850.08 --> 1856.0
so yeah it was kind of fun to have them

1854.32 --> 1859.12
on the flat earth debates and

1856.0 --> 1862.08
hear nathan mauling them

1859.12 --> 1863.039
teabagging them and all that but does

1862.08 --> 1867.6
that mean that we

1863.039 --> 1869.44
need them no

1867.6 --> 1871.76
only real function that the baller

1869.44 --> 1872.3200000000002
served in the flat earth debate in the

1871.76 --> 1876.32
recent

1872.32 --> 1878.8799999999999
period is just to demonstrate

1876.32 --> 1880.24
what are what the flat earth debate is

1878.88 --> 1884.0800000000002
like

1880.24 --> 1887.1200000000001
when facing something not flat earth

1884.08 --> 1888.799
and facing ballers just to show where

1887.12 --> 1891.36
we're at

1888.799 --> 1894.559
we don't technically technically need

1891.36 --> 1894.559
them to have a show

1896.159 --> 1902.88
like i don't need ballers to have a show

1899.44 --> 1902.88
i just like to

1903.12 --> 1906.799
not be a flat earth exclusive channel

1906.08 --> 1910.399
and just

1906.799 --> 1913.44
have people in here that behave

1910.399 --> 1916.1589999999999
civilly and that can believe whatever

1913.44 --> 1917.919
because those people often are still

1916.159 --> 1921.44
looking

1917.919 --> 1922.24
still trying to develop it or they might

1921.44 --> 1925.3600000000001
get

1922.24 --> 1935.84
some philosophical thing out of it

1925.36 --> 1935.84
not necessarily cosmic cosmogeny

1937.12 --> 1949.84
gem brings the worst is everyone that's

1939.6 --> 1949.84
not english

1959.44 --> 1965.76
they're not really globies no

1962.96 --> 1968.72
what no they are globies they're just

1965.76 --> 1970.64
fanatically globbies they're not

1968.72 --> 1973.1200000000001
carried by the suspense of this belief

1970.64 --> 1975.8400000000001
no if they've weaponized and

1973.12 --> 1977.36
structurally reinforced the suspense of

1975.84 --> 1979.76
disbelief

1977.36 --> 1981.6
to basically be a prison to them to

1979.76 --> 1983.36
never be able to get out of that

1981.6 --> 1985.279
suspense of disbelief

1983.36 --> 1986.4799999999998
so that the earth would forever be a

1985.279 --> 1990.24
globe in their mind

1986.48 --> 1992.799
that's what they are that's

1990.24 --> 1994.08
real globies it's called religious

1992.799 --> 1996.799
fanatics

1994.08 --> 1997.76
or zealots as nathan likes to call them

1996.799 --> 1999.84
that's real

1997.76 --> 2002.24
they do believe the ball they do believe

1999.84 --> 2004.72
the ball even though they should know

2002.24 --> 2007.519
it's absolutely impossible yet they do

2004.72 --> 2007.519
still believe

2007.679 --> 2011.3600000000001
that's what a religious fanatic does

2010.24 --> 2014.799
it's real

2011.36 --> 2015.36
they really believe it the dumber it

2014.799 --> 2018.559
becomes

2015.36 --> 2020.559
the more real it is because they can

2018.559 --> 2022.48
effectively fool themselves even though

2020.559 --> 2024.559
they can't fool the outside world unless

2022.48 --> 2028.08
the outside world wants to be fooled

2024.559 --> 2028.08
into believing what they believe

2028.72 --> 2033.84
most sensible people don't

2043.84 --> 2048.159
how can rumpus be so stupid by

2046.039 --> 2051.28
prioritizing

2048.159 --> 2052.879
what is more important that his suspense

2051.28 --> 2055.9190000000003
of disbelief

2052.879 --> 2056.7999999999997
can continue or that he is correct in

2055.919 --> 2059.04
some way

2056.8 --> 2060.32
yeah it's all about priorities if you

2059.04 --> 2062.24
don't understand that

2060.32 --> 2066.079
that doesn't make him stupid that just

2062.24 --> 2066.0789999999997
makes you short-sighted

2068.8 --> 2073.3590000000004
rumpus is not being stupid because he's

2071.28 --> 2076.8790000000004
being stupid he's being

2073.359 --> 2080.24
stupid because it's a better option

2076.879 --> 2083.04
to him you understand because he

2080.24 --> 2084.72
isn't stupid he's incredibly smart he's

2083.04 --> 2088.56
just also incredibly

2084.72 --> 2091.839
delusional in a very specific

2088.56 --> 2091.839
specific way

2100.48 --> 2117.839
lop what don't know what that means

2118.0 --> 2122.16
yeah but seriously just

2123.2 --> 2131.839
don't call people stupid when they're

2126.32 --> 2131.839
obviously not stupid

2139.599 --> 2143.3590000000004
because then you don't understand what

2142.079 --> 2146.5600000000004
it is

2143.359 --> 2146.96
that is making them act as silly as they

2146.56 --> 2150.48
do

2146.96 --> 2154.2400000000002
it's not stupidity because rompus

2150.48 --> 2156.4
isn't stupid he's just very delusional

2154.24 --> 2158.9599999999996
he's not stupid at all he's probably

2156.4 --> 2162.0
smarter than most of you in chat

2158.96 --> 2164.64
yeah i said it i said it

2162.0 --> 2165.44
it's just a big difference though you've

2164.64 --> 2168.16
broken out

2165.44 --> 2169.599
of the delusion so it's not the delusion

2168.16 --> 2172.0
is not

2169.599 --> 2173.92
making you use your intelligence to keep

2172.0 --> 2174.72
yourself hostage in the suspense of

2173.92 --> 2178.88
disbelief

2174.72 --> 2181.4399999999996
that's the difference he is very smart

2178.88 --> 2187.839
it's just very delusional on hop on top

2181.44 --> 2187.839
of that

2190.56 --> 2194.4
i don't say stupid things all the time

2192.32 --> 2197.2000000000003
oh okay todd wassel that's a good thing

2194.4 --> 2201.839
if you at least know that about yourself

2197.2 --> 2201.839
it's good for damage control

2205.839 --> 2212.72
just a sloppy bastard

2208.88 --> 2216.079
sloppy no no i don't think either

2212.72 --> 2220.56
i don't think he's sloppy though

2216.079 --> 2223.44
he's just stuck in that mechanism

2220.56 --> 2226.88
and that gives a lot of room that seems

2223.44 --> 2230.079
sloppy but he's no longer

2226.88 --> 2233.28
like at the point where it's a priority

2230.079 --> 2237.28
to not be sloppy he just

2233.28 --> 2240.0
successfully managed to bridge the gap

2237.28 --> 2243.0400000000004
of suspense of disbelief

2240.0 --> 2244.72
and then he has the room

2243.04 --> 2246.96
so to him it's much more about

2244.72 --> 2249.4399999999996
emphasizing like how did he trick

2246.96 --> 2252.96
himself with the suspense of disbelief

2249.44 --> 2254.88
and then expressing that on a frequency

2252.96 --> 2257.04
and show that you do have a lot of

2254.88 --> 2258.48
breathing room once you succeed at it

2257.04 --> 2261.04
that's what he does

2258.48 --> 2262.88
that's the demonstration it's not about

2261.04 --> 2263.7599999999998
the logical consistency of what he's

2262.88 --> 2269.52
saying

2263.76 --> 2285.8390000000004
this is it's another way of doing things

2269.52 --> 2285.839
the ball our way

2310.839 --> 2313.839
uh

2314.4 --> 2318.48
the rump is incapable i

2319.76 --> 2323.7290000000003
[Music]

2324.839 --> 2327.839
what

2330.32 --> 2332.7200000000003
right

2335.76 --> 2339.0400000000004
now the funny thing is rumpus can

2337.599 --> 2343.44
actually do it

2339.04 --> 2346.56
he just really really doesn't like

2343.44 --> 2348.7200000000003
entertaining the flat earth model

2346.56 --> 2349.68
just really doesn't like that like he

2348.72 --> 2352.72
has a

2349.68 --> 2356.24
fanatical hatred for letting his

2352.72 --> 2359.04
mind wander into that because it hurts

2356.24 --> 2359.52
he can do it though he just really hates

2359.04 --> 2363.119
it

2359.52 --> 2365.599
really really really hates it

2363.119 --> 2367.76
you don't understand if you think any of

2365.599 --> 2371.04
that is a joke

2367.76 --> 2372.4
he just really hates it so he doesn't do

2371.04 --> 2377.2
that

2372.4 --> 2377.2000000000003
he can do it he just really hates it

2378.079 --> 2382.48
so you're not gonna make him do that see

2381.92 --> 2386.079
he will

2382.48 --> 2388.2400000000002
rump us the [ __ ] out of you if you try

2386.079 --> 2388.2400000000002
it

2391.44 --> 2397.839
yeah he would lose his coolness

2393.599 --> 2397.839
absolutely he would

2403.359 --> 2409.5989999999997
but yeah every time rumpus does that

2406.8 --> 2411.52
any second he will kind of let his mind

2409.599 --> 2412.6400000000003
wander over the flat earth-based

2411.52 --> 2414.64
conceptions

2412.64 --> 2416.0789999999997
he will automatically have that

2414.64 --> 2419.2
accompanied by

2416.079 --> 2421.28
his utter disgust and just

2419.2 --> 2422.72
everything negative that he feels about

2421.28 --> 2424.4
it he will express that

2422.72 --> 2426.56
at the same time because he has to

2424.4 --> 2429.2000000000003
because that's the only way he can even

2426.56 --> 2430.16
let that stuff enter his mind

2429.2 --> 2434.319
accompanied by

2430.16 --> 2434.319
absolute disgust and hatred

2435.119 --> 2441.119
and pity like always that always it's

2438.4 --> 2443.52
pathetic always that's part it's very

2441.119 --> 2443.52
critical

2443.839 --> 2447.359
it's always useless it's always wrong

2445.76 --> 2448.2400000000002
it's always pathetic it's always

2447.359 --> 2451.2
outdated

2448.24 --> 2452.64
that he has a whole list of things that

2451.2 --> 2456.319
he can

2452.64 --> 2467.839
market with like that because that's

2456.319 --> 2467.839
who he is

2470.0 --> 2478.0
yeah gem look gem is

2474.56 --> 2479.2799999999997
like he's literally he's done with the

2478.0 --> 2481.2
real world

2479.28 --> 2484.48
jam does not live in the real world

2481.2 --> 2484.48
anymore at all

2484.96 --> 2498.0
like he is really done with it he just

2494.8 --> 2500.5600000000004
like he's beyond mechanical reasoning

2498.0 --> 2501.359
even like he does not need an excuse

2500.56 --> 2504.72
anymore he

2501.359 --> 2508.88
just like he's basically blotting out

2504.72 --> 2511.2
flat earth from his mind entirely

2508.88 --> 2512.4
like that's a man that just does not

2511.2 --> 2517.2799999999997
give a [ __ ]

2512.4 --> 2517.28
about reality anymore at all

2519.2 --> 2524.3999999999996
and so his mind will

2522.319 --> 2526.56
dwell in dangerous places because of

2524.4 --> 2527.839
that it's a natural consequence when you

2526.56 --> 2531.119
abandon

2527.839 --> 2537.839
reality in full like that

2531.119 --> 2537.839
just don't no longer care

2545.85 --> 2549.02
[Music]

2549.839 --> 2554.4
we don't see far enough if the earth is

2552.079 --> 2557.76
flat because of course

2554.4 --> 2559.839
you know if the earth is flat

2557.76 --> 2561.5200000000004
then it means that you autographically

2559.839 --> 2562.16
have a straight line of sight to

2561.52 --> 2564.16
everything

2562.16 --> 2565.359
even though yeah we still have a limit

2564.16 --> 2567.52
to our side and

2565.359 --> 2569.04
refraction will cause a limited sight

2567.52 --> 2570.88
and the fraction limit will

2569.04 --> 2573.839
obstruct things effectively until they

2570.88 --> 2576.319
become too small to see anyway

2573.839 --> 2577.119
but he just doesn't want to know he does

2576.319 --> 2580.0
not care

2577.119 --> 2580.88
it's just holding on no in my

2580.0 --> 2584.24
autographic

2580.88 --> 2586.1600000000003
view opinion if the earth is flat

2584.24 --> 2587.839
then there would be no bottoms up

2586.16 --> 2590.48
obstruction and you would see

2587.839 --> 2592.0
forever until you see the edge because

2590.48 --> 2594.319
in his autographic fuel

2592.0 --> 2595.28
model conception that's how that works

2594.319 --> 2598.16
in reality

2595.28 --> 2600.1600000000003
it doesn't he does not give a [ __ ] he

2598.16 --> 2603.2799999999997
does not want to imagine

2600.16 --> 2607.839
the earth could be flat he just

2603.28 --> 2607.8390000000004
does not give a [ __ ]

2623.76 --> 2627.76
yeah yeah but look that's in

2625.52 --> 2629.7599999999998
heliocentrism there's just this concept

2627.76 --> 2633.44
that light can literally travel

2629.76 --> 2636.8
forever if it is in a

2633.44 --> 2638.8
vacuum which it isn't but it is

2636.8 --> 2641.119
but it isn't but it is but it isn't

2638.8 --> 2644.96
right so light can just travel

2641.119 --> 2646.88
forever infinite distances billions and

2644.96 --> 2650.079
billions and billions of

2646.88 --> 2653.2000000000003
trillions quadrillions of light years

2650.079 --> 2656.5600000000004
right cadrillions of light years

2653.2 --> 2659.5989999999997
a light can travel just have to have a

2656.56 --> 2662.319
very fine detector

2659.599 --> 2663.6800000000003
then you can try because they assume it

2662.319 --> 2666.48
can

2663.68 --> 2667.7599999999998
completely ignoring the inverse square

2666.48 --> 2671.04
law

2667.76 --> 2673.6800000000003
completely ignoring that just

2671.04 --> 2674.24
they just assume it can because they

2673.68 --> 2676.96
have to

2674.24 --> 2677.2799999999997
because otherwise it makes no sense that

2676.96 --> 2680.319
we

2677.28 --> 2683.44
see stars at all

2680.319 --> 2686.88
any of them based

2683.44 --> 2688.079
on well within the model conception that

2686.88 --> 2690.6400000000003
they are physical

2688.079 --> 2693.52
things giving off this light and

2690.64 --> 2695.7599999999998
incredible distances away

2693.52 --> 2697.119
you cannot presuppose that or imagine

2695.76 --> 2699.6800000000003
that unless

2697.119 --> 2701.52
you overlook the infrasquare law and

2699.68 --> 2706.72
just imagine that light can

2701.52 --> 2709.839
travel insane astronomical distances

2706.72 --> 2709.839
and still be visible

2716.079 --> 2722.88
species water no

2719.52 --> 2726.079
just no nobody says that

2722.88 --> 2728.88
nobody thinks that just

2726.079 --> 2729.44
no and anytime somebody brings that up

2728.88 --> 2732.079
they're just

2729.44 --> 2734.16
stupid it's just stupid to see ooh

2732.079 --> 2735.76
water's divided from the water so that

2734.16 --> 2737.68
means there's water up there because

2735.76 --> 2739.599
they don't [ __ ] think about it

2737.68 --> 2741.1189999999997
because they're stupid and short-sighted

2739.599 --> 2744.4
they just want

2741.119 --> 2745.04
i just want the color to fill in this

2744.4 --> 2748.1600000000003
little

2745.04 --> 2751.92
coloring drawing i just want the color

2748.16 --> 2752.319
oh water i'm drawing this blue because i

2751.92 --> 2755.359
read

2752.319 --> 2755.359
water somewhere

2756.88 --> 2763.839
yeah that's what that is it's just dumb

2760.48 --> 2767.839
just people not thinking about it

2763.839 --> 2767.839
sick of it no proof

2769.28 --> 2772.96
no proof no proof it's a disc circle

2772.319 --> 2776.64
it's not a

2772.96 --> 2778.88
disc no proof there is water up there

2776.64 --> 2779.68
because waters were divided from the

2778.88 --> 2781.28
waters

2779.68 --> 2783.359
and you don't freaking know what the

2781.28 --> 2785.6800000000003
firmament is

2783.359 --> 2787.2
you don't you don't even know if it's

2785.68 --> 2790.16
the supposed solid

2787.2 --> 2791.839
barrier that that provides the

2790.16 --> 2803.39
containment of the realm

2791.839 --> 2805.04
nobody knows this stop deluding yourself

2803.39 --> 2807.359
[Music]

2805.04 --> 2808.24
it's not personally directed to anyone

but if you

2808.24 --> 2815.4399999999996
feel oh that comes home i feel that

2812.16 --> 2818.3999999999996
yeah then it is meant for you because

2815.44 --> 2818.88
a huge amount of people just accept

2818.4 --> 2822.319
these

2818.88 --> 2823.839
things out of nowhere without any actual

2822.319 --> 2826.079
proof

2823.839 --> 2826.96
just model the [ __ ] out of it in some

2826.079 --> 2829.599
way until

2826.96 --> 2830.079
it's just sufficient enough evidence for

2829.599 --> 2833.599
them to

2830.079 --> 2836.2400000000002
just accept it take it for granted and

2833.599 --> 2839.3590000000004
then start echoing that like they know

2836.24 --> 2841.7599999999998
they don't nobody freaking knows there's

2839.359 --> 2847.2799999999997
not enough evidence

2841.76 --> 2847.28
just a couple of hints very vague

2847.8 --> 2851.699
[Music]

2856.839 --> 2859.839
okay

2866.72 --> 2873.839
if i know an astronaut i just leave them

2870.839 --> 2873.839
alone

2874.4 --> 2881.6800000000003
i believe seriously it must be in ways

2878.079 --> 2884.8
quite miserable to be an astronaut

2881.68 --> 2888.0789999999997
and if it's not at first it

2884.8 --> 2891.52
will be yeah

2888.079 --> 2894.8
cause at first you might enjoy the lies

2891.52 --> 2896.24
and the power and the control until

2894.8 --> 2900.48
that's

2896.24 --> 2904.16
just starts to suck and now you're stuck

2900.48 --> 2904.16
so i just leave him alone

2905.839 --> 2910.0789999999997
bet it sucks to be an astronaut might

2909.04 --> 2915.839
not at first

2910.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
but it will

2916.9 --> 2920.09
[Music]

2924.16 --> 2929.1189999999997
oh because they deserve all our violence

2927.599 --> 2932.4
right

2929.119 --> 2935.52
just attack the actors

2932.4 --> 2936.2400000000002
because they're the fault they made us

2935.52 --> 2938.24
believe

2936.24 --> 2940.72
something amazing and then it turned out

2938.24 --> 2941.359
not to be true so let's all attack them

2940.72 --> 2943.68
that's so

2941.359 --> 2944.96
sensible because they deserve our

2943.68 --> 2948.319
violence right

2944.96 --> 2948.96
that's the sensible thing to do come on

2948.319 --> 2951.44
people

you look stupid do you understand

3180.0 --> 3183.52
oh you think you're a flat earther so

3181.52 --> 3184.559
that means that acting like a [ __ ]

3183.52 --> 3186.24
[ __ ]

3184.559 --> 3188.2400000000002
is okay because you're a flat earther

3186.24 --> 3191.1189999999997

3191.119 --> 3194.4
understand

3192.559 --> 3196.2400000000002
now you think you're smart in that

3194.4 --> 3197.44
moment maybe because you're on the right

3196.24 --> 3199.5989999999997
side of the argument

3197.44 --> 3202.079
guess what everybody looking will see

3199.599 --> 3203.52
you being a [ __ ]

3202.079 --> 3205.599
yeah that's the impression you're

3203.52 --> 3209.839
leaving think about that the next time

3205.599 --> 3209.839
you do that

3210.24 --> 3216.0789999999997
yes just make a joke you know better

3212.88 --> 3216.079
than to make a joke

3216.559 --> 3220.96
in the face of a serious thing with me

3219.28 --> 3224.0
because i never

3220.96 --> 3224.7200000000003
accept that i always respond extremely

3224.0 --> 3228.079
serious

3224.72 --> 3230.9599999999996
you can't make a joke

3228.079 --> 3232.559
to escape from the seriousness of the

3230.96 --> 3234.88
situation in my presence

3232.559 --> 3237.8390000000004
you just can't you should know better

3234.88 --> 3237.839
than that

3246.48 --> 3250.4
but it's not yeah thank you unicorn

3248.48 --> 3251.119
laser eyes it's not even against

3250.4 --> 3254.96
violence

3251.119 --> 3257.6800000000003
it's just the stupid blame game

3254.96 --> 3258.559
oh you were fooled you had a dream it

3257.68 --> 3261.68
hurts

3258.559 --> 3265.28

3261.68 --> 3268.0
basically selling the lies

3265.28 --> 3268.4
that you bought that now hurt attack

3268.0 --> 3271.28

3271.28 --> 3276.4
will not happen again

3272.72 --> 3277.52
wrong why don't you [ __ ] get over

3276.4 --> 3280.64
your short

3277.52 --> 3283.44
term instinctual responses

3280.64 --> 3283.92
and actually think about what's going on

3283.44 --> 3286.7200000000003
for

3283.92 --> 3286.7200000000003
[ __ ] sake

3286.96 --> 3292.64
stop attacking people stop targeting

3290.559 --> 3295.8390000000004
because of a frustration

3292.64 --> 3299.359
stop attacking not just violence

3295.839 --> 3300.16
attacking in general picking a target

3299.359 --> 3304.16
and saying

3300.16 --> 3307.92
that person must go down because bad

3304.16 --> 3311.2
that don't do it ever

3307.92 --> 3313.599
never ever do it ever

3311.2 --> 3315.52
it's always wrong it always leads to

3313.599 --> 3319.3590000000004
[ __ ]

3315.52 --> 3319.7599999999998
never do it ever ever for any reason

3319.359 --> 3324.0
it's

3319.76 --> 3335.4
always wrong always wrong always

3324.0 --> 3343.239
wrong you understand

3335.4 --> 3343.239
[Music]

3346.839 --> 3349.839
ah

3353.44 --> 3360.64
like see it like this

3356.64 --> 3363.2
the greatest warrior is the person

3360.64 --> 3365.04
that does nothing and lets their enemy

3363.2 --> 3368.319
destroy themselves

3365.04 --> 3368.319
that's the best warrior

3368.72 --> 3372.16
but you gotta know though

3372.4 --> 3381.76
you might help them destroy themselves

3377.04 --> 3383.599
never never be the one to destroy them

3381.76 --> 3385.28
if you're on the right side of things if

3383.599 --> 3386.48
you are with logos if you're not with

3385.28 --> 3390.1600000000003
lies

3386.48 --> 3392.88
don't destroy the lies let it destroy

3390.16 --> 3392.8799999999997
itself

3393.599 --> 3397.599
because otherwise you're just committing

3396.4 --> 3401.2000000000003
sin

3397.599 --> 3403.599
you're committing sin to try and remove

3401.2 --> 3407.68
something that is going to effectively

3403.599 --> 3407.6800000000003
remove itself by its very nature

3407.76 --> 3411.6800000000003
it's going to negate itself or it's

3409.839 --> 3414.5589999999997
going to be another test

3411.68 --> 3416.24
for other people to get over their

3414.559 --> 3419.8390000000004
delusions

3416.24 --> 3419.839
because that's what it always is

3430.559 --> 3434.7200000000003
anyway i think i made my point plenty

3436.16 --> 3439.92
stop nagging you about it but it's like

3438.72 --> 3442.16
seriously people

3439.92 --> 3442.16
like

3444.4 --> 3448.1600000000003
when are people just gonna get over the

3446.799 --> 3450.72
fact that

3448.16 --> 3452.64
like it's just don't behave like a

3450.72 --> 3456.0789999999997
six-year-old don't let it go

3452.64 --> 3459.04
it's never good to do that never good

3456.079 --> 3460.48
to let it go to let the faculties go and

3459.04 --> 3463.52
just start behaving

3460.48 --> 3464.16
like a dumbass for any reason for any

3463.52 --> 3467.28
target

3464.16 --> 3470.48
for any goal it's never good

3467.28 --> 3472.7200000000003
you should just never do that ever

3470.48 --> 3474.559
you know if you have a frustration and

3472.72 --> 3475.7599999999998
you you're like you're exploding you

3474.559 --> 3478.0
have to do

3475.76 --> 3480.1600000000003
a thing to get it out okay that's one

3478.0 --> 3483.52
thing but never just think

3480.16 --> 3485.2799999999997
well i think i'm just going to act like

3483.52 --> 3487.839
a [ __ ] [ __ ] today and just

3485.28 --> 3488.4
really dumb go oh you're stupid you're

3487.839 --> 3493.2799999999997
stupid

3488.4 --> 3493.28
it's never okay never

3493.599 --> 3502.48
always is [ __ ] always it always

3497.359 --> 3506.72
leaves [ __ ] never do it

3502.48 --> 3509.76
don't act like that figure things out

3506.72 --> 3512.0789999999997
that's much more productive

3509.76 --> 3513.92
don't just attack don't just [ __ ] on

3512.079 --> 3515.119
things don't just ram things into the

3513.92 --> 3519.119
ground

3515.119 --> 3521.2000000000003
explore figure out why learn

3519.119 --> 3523.44
that should be the focus that should be

3521.2 --> 3527.04
the priority at all times and

3523.44 --> 3530.079
never just stomping on things

3527.04 --> 3534.16
never do it

3530.079 --> 3535.92
unless you're like in the moment like

3534.16 --> 3537.5989999999997
really ticked off about something and

3535.92 --> 3540.079
you can't focus

3537.599 --> 3541.2000000000003
just need to say something and then get

3540.079 --> 3543.599
over it

3541.2 --> 3545.2
you know that's as i said people have to

3543.599 --> 3548.88
deal with feelings

3545.2 --> 3549.4399999999996
but it's never okay to hang on to that

3548.88 --> 3552.88
sort of

3549.44 --> 3554.96
action on that modus

3552.88 --> 3556.48
should never do it because it's not

3554.96 --> 3559.76
productive

3556.48 --> 3562.88
it's just leaves behind [ __ ] you don't

3559.76 --> 3564.7990000000004
grow from doing that

3562.88 --> 3568.6400000000003
and when you don't grow from such

3564.799 --> 3571.68
actions those actions should be scrapped

3568.64 --> 3573.359
from your live playbook

3571.68 --> 3574.8799999999997
they should be because you're not

3573.359 --> 3577.359
growing when you do it it's

3574.88 --> 3578.1600000000003
literally just wasting your time and

3577.359 --> 3581.2799999999997
energy

3578.16 --> 3583.92
and others too probably echoing

3581.28 --> 3586.079
bad behavior other people will start to

3583.92 --> 3589.52
take that example from you

3586.079 --> 3592.0
it's bad just don't do it

3589.52 --> 3594.4
oh you don't like it you don't like oh

3592.0 --> 3597.52
oh it's getting too close now oh you're

3594.4 --> 3598.64
i remind you of your parents do i oh

3597.52 --> 3600.319
well maybe

3598.64 --> 3601.68
maybe they had a freaking point when

3600.319 --> 3604.16
they did started this thing

3601.68 --> 3604.96
right maybe you just have to deal with

3604.16 --> 3608.8799999999997
your freaking

3604.96 --> 3609.52
ego that tells you no i can do whatever

3608.88 --> 3612.0
i want

3609.52 --> 3612.799
i can just act like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3612.0 --> 3616.48
because i

3612.799 --> 3619.119
want to yeah well maybe you should just

3616.48 --> 3620.2400000000002
kick yourself in the face when you feel

3619.119 --> 3623.76
like that and say

3620.24 --> 3626.16
no no that's stupid

3623.76 --> 3628.079
i don't want to be stupid i don't want

3626.16 --> 3632.0789999999997
to be a nasty little

3628.079 --> 3633.28
ego [ __ ] that just wants to act like a

3632.079 --> 3635.04
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3633.28 --> 3637.2000000000003
so i'm gonna do it and nobody's gonna

3635.04 --> 3640.5589999999997
stop me maybe you should just

3637.2 --> 3656.799
stop feeding that demon

3640.559 --> 3658.6400000000003
inside of you right

3656.799 --> 3661.119
imagine a world where you think before

3658.64 --> 3661.68
you talk yeah i try to imagine it all

3661.119 --> 3671.839
the time

3661.68 --> 3671.839
i'm building it

3675.119 --> 3677.359
what

3678.48 --> 3682.079
i think we are all geocentric with a

3681.04 --> 3686.799
heliocentric

3682.079 --> 3690.1600000000003
veneer that been painting a blah

3686.799 --> 3690.16
carl sagan is just

3691.68 --> 3696.16
he was just a philosophical heliocentric

3695.04 --> 3699.359
priest front

3696.16 --> 3701.68
storyteller he's like the guy oh that

3699.359 --> 3706.319
knows all the mystical stuff it's

3701.68 --> 3706.319
literally a prime storyteller carl sagan

3711.28 --> 3715.52
yeah we're all geocentric with the

3713.76 --> 3718.559
heliocentric veneer is

3715.52 --> 3718.559
just nonsense

3722.64 --> 3728.96
like what do you mean we all think that

3726.0 --> 3730.64
if he meant the indoctrinated people

3728.96 --> 3732.16
that believe the story

3730.64 --> 3733.839
they don't know what the hell they're

3732.16 --> 3737.2
thinking they don't

3733.839 --> 3738.72
think at all because if they would

3737.2 --> 3740.5589999999997
they would put the pieces together and

3738.72 --> 3741.5989999999997
then realize oh wait the pieces don't

3740.559 --> 3744.92
fit together

3741.599 --> 3749.76
ah yeah nobody is

3744.92 --> 3752.559
heliocentric or geocentric

3749.76 --> 3753.599
because in this case geocentric also

3752.559 --> 3756.4
emphasize

3753.599 --> 3758.2400000000002
physical balls floating out there and

3756.4 --> 3759.359
the earth being a ball right it's all

3758.24 --> 3762.5589999999997
nonsense

3759.359 --> 3763.52
it's just oh geocentric is well maybe

3762.559 --> 3766.079
two percent

3763.52 --> 3766.88
less nonsense than the heliocentric

3766.079 --> 3769.1600000000003
model

3766.88 --> 3771.2000000000003
it's still violates the second law of

3769.16 --> 3774.3999999999996
thermodynamics

3771.2 --> 3774.96
it still reifies the horizon into a

3774.4 --> 3778.64
sphere

3774.96 --> 3781.839
edge and all the other things it's

3778.64 --> 3782.4
it's still [ __ ] it's just two

3781.839 --> 3786.24
percent

3782.4 --> 3790.4
less [ __ ] so no

3786.24 --> 3792.319
carl sagan uh

3790.4 --> 3794.799
he's just a blabber i've never been

3792.319 --> 3798.079
impressed with anything he said

3794.799 --> 3811.839
like ever there's much more interesting

3798.079 --> 3811.8390000000004
wiser people out there to listen to

3822.839 --> 3825.839
huh

3832.319 --> 3834.64
okay

3837.28 --> 3841.2000000000003
took bill nye took up where sagan left

3839.52 --> 3841.7599999999998
off well that should be very telling

3841.2 --> 3844.96
because

3841.76 --> 3848.96
bill nye is an absolute [ __ ]

3844.96 --> 3852.48
like that guy is really [ __ ] dumb

3848.96 --> 3854.7200000000003
really [ __ ] dumb like frustrating

3852.48 --> 3856.64
levels of dumb

3854.72 --> 3858.5589999999997
must be a pain in the ass to try and

3856.64 --> 3860.96
explain him something real like a

3858.559 --> 3861.599
pain in the ass because the guy is a

3860.96 --> 3864.7200000000003
[ __ ]

3861.599 --> 3869.039
[ __ ] really bad dumb

3864.72 --> 3871.9199999999996
really bad levels of dumb

3869.039 --> 3871.92
very annoying

3872.16 --> 3875.359
very annoying person

3877.92 --> 3883.839
all right now carl sagan

3881.76 --> 3886.1600000000003
might not have been a real genius

3883.839 --> 3895.0389999999998
himself but at least he's not as [ __ ]

3886.16 --> 3898.64
dumb as bill nye

3895.039 --> 3901.44
right it's not good to dwell upon it

3898.64 --> 3901.44
it's just that

3902.559 --> 3906.3190000000004
these front people are just it's like

3905.68 --> 3909.52
they do

3906.319 --> 3912.16
pick out the really dumb ones they want

3909.52 --> 3915.359
the stupid to rub off they really i

3912.16 --> 3917.52
think it is a real strategy

3915.359 --> 3919.359
i think they're literally picking really

3917.52 --> 3922.4
stupid people to try to get

3919.359 --> 3925.92
in their system i don't know how they

3922.4 --> 3927.119
keep them sane being that stupid and

3925.92 --> 3930.799
still dealing with

3927.119 --> 3934.319
delusion i don't know if they keep

3930.799 --> 3934.72
how much they keep from them they try to

3934.319 --> 3938.799
keep

3934.72 --> 3941.9199999999996
fooling them as if they were recipients

3938.799 --> 3942.88
of the ball religion i don't know that i

3941.92 --> 3946.4
just know they

3942.88 --> 3946.88
are stupid bill nye is really [ __ ]

3946.4 --> 3950.7200000000003
dumb

3946.88 --> 3954.1600000000003
like really and so is

3950.72 --> 3958.3999999999996
what's this name again the nasa guy

3954.16 --> 3962.319
uh petite that guy

3958.4 --> 3965.359
don pettit get guys really [ __ ] he's

3962.319 --> 3970.96
dumber than bill nye that's

3965.359 --> 3974.88
already pretty creepy but carl sagan

3970.96 --> 3979.839
he wasn't brilliant he just wasn't

3974.88 --> 3982.96
that dumb right

3979.839 --> 3984.24
he really was not brilliant he really

3982.96 --> 3987.039
wasn't

3984.24 --> 3988.72
if you could quote me a single thing

3987.039 --> 3991.8390000000004
that was actually

3988.72 --> 3994.5589999999997
actually smart not just play around

3991.839 --> 3998.72
trickery but actually smart or wise

3994.559 --> 4000.88
that carl sagan said then please tell me

3998.72 --> 4002.319
because i don't remember it i just

4000.88 --> 4006.079
remember he is just

4002.319 --> 4010.24
bullshitting all everything constantly

4006.079 --> 4010.2400000000002
cheap ass extrapolations

4012.88 --> 4020.4
don petit george mcfly

4016.4 --> 4022.2400000000002
this oh is

4020.4 --> 4024.96
that's not fair though because george

4022.24 --> 4026.64
mcfly in the movie was actually kind of

4024.96 --> 4030.2400000000002
a smart character he was just

4026.64 --> 4032.4
a nerd a sign well no he's not really a

4030.24 --> 4036.4799999999996
smart guy he was like a science fiction

4032.4 --> 4038.799
boomer wasn't he he really was like a

4036.48 --> 4042.0
science fiction boomer

4038.799 --> 4045.359
nerd whacking off

4042.0 --> 4048.72
the porn and spy peeping tom

4045.359 --> 4052.88
on people and interested in science

4048.72 --> 4055.2
fiction so he really was a nerd

4052.88 --> 4056.96
and i guess that i kind of tricked

4055.2 --> 4059.359
myself there thinking like oh that

4056.96 --> 4060.88
he's smart but he doesn't actually prove

4059.359 --> 4063.2
he is smart

4060.88 --> 4064.88
throughout the entire back to the future

4063.2 --> 4068.3999999999996
like a single time he's

4064.88 --> 4071.92
never done anything smart in the

4068.4 --> 4074.1600000000003
entire franchise does anybody realize

4071.92 --> 4074.16
that

4075.359 --> 4081.44
like his dad

4078.4 --> 4085.52
marty mcfly's dad he

4081.44 --> 4087.28
is dumb now that i think about it

4085.52 --> 4089.68
he was interested in science fiction

4087.28 --> 4091.92
he's a peeping tom squirter

4089.68 --> 4093.2
he's never done a single thing that

4091.92 --> 4095.92
could actually be

4093.2 --> 4097.44
be considered intelligent throughout the

4095.92 --> 4101.839
entire franchise

4097.44 --> 4101.839
so yeah his den is a [ __ ] [ __ ]

4102.4 --> 4109.3589999999995
and to be more specific a boomer [ __ ]

4105.6 --> 4109.359
literally from that generation

4112.88 --> 4119.839
just realized that it's really weird

4123.479 --> 4126.569
[Music]

4126.719 --> 4130.08
i bet the actor is a lot smarter than

4128.64 --> 4133.839
the character he was playing

4130.08 --> 4133.839
by the way

4149.12 --> 4153.44
what why would you make a steak in a

4152.48 --> 4156.0
toaster

4153.44 --> 4157.5199999999995
that's that's the dumbest thing i've

4156.0 --> 4159.839
ever heard that's

4157.52 --> 4162.64
if you do that it literally just short

4159.839 --> 4165.92
circuit once the fat really starts to

4162.64 --> 4165.92
spray around and [ __ ]

4167.679 --> 4175.839
that's ridiculous

4180.159 --> 4185.3589999999995
yeah but look flat side the whole coffee

4183.359 --> 4188.4800000000005
thing in the iss

4185.359 --> 4188.88
i i don't understand why somebody didn't

4188.48 --> 4191.199
just

4188.88 --> 4192.08
disconnect the line at that point like

4191.199 --> 4194.32
he was so

4192.08 --> 4195.679
dumb at that point and they just let him

4194.32 --> 4197.92
do that like

4195.679 --> 4200.56
i was like the first time i watched it i

4197.92 --> 4204.64
literally felt like the instinct like

4200.56 --> 4208.719
ah disconnect disconnect

4204.64 --> 4214.8
you can't do this stupid it's too bad

4208.719 --> 4218.96
stop stop it now it's just too stupid

4214.8 --> 4218.96
i would just had that instinct like cut

4228.84 --> 4231.84
cut

4234.8 --> 4245.84
they're being weird anyway be right back

4256.84 --> 4259.84
so

4319.679 --> 4332.719
hey hello jason mccormack

4328.96 --> 4337.92
oh my chat is very active at least today

4332.719 --> 4341.76
good has a new one out

4337.92 --> 4345.84
the end david weiss is a new video

4341.76 --> 4345.84
right i do get notifications for that

4346.56 --> 4351.92
according to the helio nonsensical model

4353.04 --> 4359.36
all right

4356.08 --> 4360.88
yeah yeah okay yeah that video is just

4359.36 --> 4364.88
about the nonsense

4360.88 --> 4366.96
of basically moving through space

4364.88 --> 4369.12
and the natural consequences and then

4366.96 --> 4370.64
all these things sitting perfectly still

4369.12 --> 4372.08
on the earth how that doesn't make any

4370.64 --> 4375.52
sense

4372.08 --> 4378.719
yeah i don't think it's the first time

4375.52 --> 4378.719
he made a video about that

4379.36 --> 4383.679
but yeah david wise always has like

4381.04 --> 4385.679
these snippet quick videos trying to

4383.679 --> 4387.78
remind you about these details

4385.679 --> 4391.01
so that's good

4387.78 --> 4391.009999999999
[Music]

4393.6 --> 4399.84
michael jones what are you talking about

4401.36 --> 4413.839999999999
the actor was really kooky which actor

4424.84 --> 4427.84
so

4439.84 --> 4447.360000000001
what what are you guys talking about

4443.52 --> 4447.360000000001
i'm not following anymore

4450.96 --> 4454.0
i'm trying to figure out what the hell

4453.04 --> 4456.719
you're talking about

4454.0 --> 4469.84
but i can't find any logical consistency

4456.719 --> 4469.84
in what you're talking about anymore

4471.679 --> 4483.84
in his last interview what

4475.199 --> 4483.839999999999
last interview

4488.96 --> 4492.88
interview with that young guy

4494.84 --> 4497.84
okay

4514.48 --> 4524.48
so which interview exactly are you

4516.719 --> 4527.28
referring to

4524.48 --> 4528.4
because i don't know any david weiss

4527.28 --> 4532.159
video that is

4528.4 --> 4534.32
actually long enough like that

4532.159 --> 4535.679
he just all has very short videos so i

4534.32 --> 4536.639999999999
don't know what you're talking about

4535.679 --> 4539.28
there is no

4536.64 --> 4539.92
an hour video that i know of on his

4539.28 --> 4543.36
channel

4539.92 --> 4545.6
i'm flicking through it right now

4543.36 --> 4546.719
last time he had actually had a long

4545.6 --> 4550.96
video was when

4546.719 --> 4554.32
yeah a screensaver of the campfire

4550.96 --> 4555.52
that thing is over five minutes

4554.32 --> 4557.23
so i don't know what you're talking

4555.52 --> 4560.330000000001
about

4557.23 --> 4560.33
[Music]

4560.719 --> 4567.84
co-creator podcast yeah yeah that's cute

4575.54 --> 4578.649
[Music]

4591.76 --> 4609.84
today the sun stood still wet

4612.159 --> 4616.239
all right michael jones you were talking

4614.32 --> 4623.84
about

4616.239 --> 4627.28
george mcfly right

4623.84 --> 4629.4400000000005
he was acting kooky right

4627.28 --> 4632.639999999999
but the actor himself was like a method

4629.44 --> 4634.639999999999
actor very serious

4632.64 --> 4636.0
so i think that the character that he

4634.64 --> 4651.84
played was a lot dumber

4636.0 --> 4651.84
than the actual actor

4660.48 --> 4665.0199999999995
[Music]

4676.84 --> 4681.2
right

4678.159 --> 4684.7699999999995

4689.52 --> 4693.84

4702.88 --> 4709.679
play the crickets

4706.64 --> 4710.4800000000005
because that's something i really don't

4709.679 --> 4715.04
care about

4710.48 --> 4721.839999999999
at all not british enough or something

4715.04 --> 4721.84

4753.76 --> 4758.96
sun and moon app serious he's been

4756.0 --> 4763.84
advertising the [ __ ] out of that thing

4758.96 --> 4763.84
for years now

4764.4 --> 4767.759999999999
okay it's reconnected

4770.8 --> 4774.88
can you still see me out there

4775.44 --> 4779.678999999999
yes oh thank god it's still going

4780.0 --> 4786.159
yeah i noticed that just in time or this

4782.48 --> 4786.159
yeah the show would have disconnected

4788.84 --> 4793.7390000000005
again

4790.59 --> 4793.7390000000005
[Music]

4795.6 --> 4805.84
all right

4816.84 --> 4819.84
okay

4842.4 --> 4849.36
do you have the app

4846.08 --> 4851.5199999999995
what would i have the app for if i don't

4849.36 --> 4854.0
have a freaking mobile with internet

4851.52 --> 4858.84
capability to install it on

4854.0 --> 4861.84
so no i don't have any apps

4858.84 --> 4861.84
ever

4869.64 --> 4876.159000000001
[Music]

4872.84 --> 4878.88
one what about the moon

4876.159 --> 4878.879999999999
what about it

4886.84 --> 4889.84
what

4907.199 --> 4911.12
okay i don't really understand the

4909.12 --> 4913.59
question flat side

4911.12 --> 4914.84
does the moon have a color

4913.59 --> 4917.84
[Music]

4914.84 --> 4920.96
uh does it

4917.84 --> 4924.56
define have

4920.96 --> 4927.92
you know there's light coming

4924.56 --> 4931.52
from there from that angular the

4927.92 --> 4935.4400000000005
direction and all that

4931.52 --> 4938.2390000000005
does the light have a color sure

4935.44 --> 4938.799999999999
does it have different spectrum of color

4938.239 --> 4942.239
as

4938.8 --> 4946.639
the sun would give off

4942.239 --> 4951.199
or the sunlight would be sure

4946.639 --> 4954.88
so could you philosophize or state

4951.199 --> 4957.919999999999
that every light has color yes

4954.88 --> 4960.08
yes you can because you can use a prism

4957.92 --> 4962.32
to split it up and then reveal

4960.08 --> 4965.679
all those different colors that are

4962.32 --> 4965.679
simultaneously present

4967.679 --> 4974.56
so yes light

4970.96 --> 4974.56
has color all of it

4976.08 --> 4987.84
there is literally no light without

4978.239 --> 4987.839999999999
color that's a physical impossibility

4990.56 --> 5001.84
ever consider that

5004.4 --> 5012.4
no the other way around no light

5008.239 --> 5015.599999999999
without color if there is light

5012.4 --> 5018.32
then that light will be color otherwise

5015.6 --> 5018.8
it would not be light all light is can

5018.32 --> 5023.5199999999995
be

5018.8 --> 5023.52
prism split up in colors all of it

5023.76 --> 5029.04
unless you have like an extremely

5026.88 --> 5030.96
one color specific type of light like

5029.04 --> 5033.5199999999995
very specifically red now that old's

5030.96 --> 5036.88
only going to split up in red

5033.52 --> 5039.6
because the rest is already taken out

5036.88 --> 5041.04
but there is no light if there is no

5039.6 --> 5044.08
color

5041.04 --> 5046.639
it's just a fact of light

5044.08 --> 5046.639
and color

5047.6 --> 5057.84
only black only the absence of light

5051.36 --> 5057.839999999999
has no color that's a fact

5064.32 --> 5067.5199999999995
why they thought the moon was made out

5065.92 --> 5070.96
of cheese

5067.52 --> 5073.1990000000005
i don't think so

5070.96 --> 5075.44
i think the they were thinking the moon

5073.199 --> 5078.4
was made out of cheese

5075.44 --> 5078.879999999999
because yeah the freaking moon you know

5078.4 --> 5082.719
very

5078.88 --> 5085.36
confusing very very very confusing to a

5082.719 --> 5087.679
whole bunch of people

5085.36 --> 5090.4
and then one day somebody thought like

5087.679 --> 5093.679
hey i'm cutting this cheese open

5090.4 --> 5095.44
what the wow that really reminds me of

5093.679 --> 5097.52
the moon

5095.44 --> 5098.96
and then they probably thought yeah well

5097.52 --> 5102.080000000001
you know

5098.96 --> 5104.96
maybe the moon is made of cheese

5102.08 --> 5106.0
and that's probably not that's like

5104.96 --> 5108.4
still from a

5106.0 --> 5110.96
flat earth neutral perspective before

5108.4 --> 5114.48
heliocentric indoctrination really took

5110.96 --> 5116.0
hold so they were like

5114.48 --> 5117.759999999999
yeah the freaking moon you know it's

5116.0 --> 5119.6
crazy don't don't

5117.76 --> 5120.88
look too much at the moon don't think

5119.6 --> 5123.84
about it too much you'll

5120.88 --> 5124.88
turn out lunatic but some people may

5123.84 --> 5128.400000000001
have been like

5124.88 --> 5131.52
huh this cheese when cut through

5128.4 --> 5134.879999999999
really looks like the moon so that means

5131.52 --> 5138.080000000001
the moon's made of cheese

5134.88 --> 5139.679
it's like just like that and it kind of

5138.08 --> 5141.12
stuck and people were like oh well maybe

5139.679 --> 5143.28
it does kind of look like cheese

5141.12 --> 5144.88
because they don't really care because

5143.28 --> 5147.599999999999
it's the moon

5144.88 --> 5148.4800000000005
and the moon is just weird and not a

5147.6 --> 5151.76
ball

5148.48 --> 5153.44
physically floating around the earth

5151.76 --> 5156.0
ball

5153.44 --> 5157.839999999999
like that and then yeah it's up for

5156.0 --> 5159.36
grabs like yeah what the hell is it you

5157.84 --> 5161.360000000001
know it's this weird light

5159.36 --> 5162.719
the luminary it's really weird it's

5161.36 --> 5165.5199999999995
suggestible

5162.719 --> 5167.28
what is it yeah and then people wonder

5165.52 --> 5171.76
about that

5167.28 --> 5173.5199999999995
for eons generation after generation

5171.76 --> 5176.719
staring at the moon and just trying to

5173.52 --> 5178.320000000001
figure out what the hell is that

5176.719 --> 5181.12
and somebody came up with well maybe

5178.32 --> 5181.12
it's kind of cheese

5181.679 --> 5184.2390000000005
why not

5192.37 --> 5195.5
[Music]

5208.84 --> 5211.84
um

5213.12 --> 5220.5599999999995
of cream cheese well that's stupid

5216.88 --> 5223.76
that just makes it really lame

5220.56 --> 5224.96
it's again more heliocentric virtue

5223.76 --> 5228.56
signaling like

5224.96 --> 5232.08
if you don't believe heliocentrism

5228.56 --> 5234.2390000000005
and science then

5232.08 --> 5236.08
well if you come up with some other idea

5234.239 --> 5238.32
that doesn't fit it we're just gonna

5236.08 --> 5241.679
make it as cooky as possible

5238.32 --> 5243.36
with very much in your face [ __ ]

5241.679 --> 5244.639
elements that the original people

5243.36 --> 5248.4
probably didn't claim

5244.639 --> 5251.12
to make it seem extra stupid so don't

5248.4 --> 5251.44
when you read it you don't get the idea

5251.12 --> 5253.92
that

5251.44 --> 5255.599999999999
might be maybe it's interesting to think

5253.92 --> 5259.1990000000005
about an alternative no no it's

5255.6 --> 5261.4400000000005
just stupid never wonder outside of

5259.199 --> 5264.96
heliocentric thinking people

5261.44 --> 5265.678999999999
never do that because then it's really

5264.96 --> 5269.199
really dumb

5265.679 --> 5272.2390000000005
so never doubt the globe ever it's just

5269.199 --> 5275.599999999999
stupid and there's going to be as much

5272.239 --> 5278.0
reinforcement to that that notion that

5275.6 --> 5279.1990000000005
everything non-heliocentric is just

5278.0 --> 5282.0
really [ __ ] dumb

5279.199 --> 5284.08
there will be as much reinforcement you

5282.0 --> 5287.52
can imagine

5284.08 --> 5289.92
out there for that so yeah they say

5287.52 --> 5291.040000000001
the moonish grain of green cheese is so

5289.92 --> 5293.28
[ __ ] dumb

5291.04 --> 5294.159
like of course it's there of course it's

5293.28 --> 5297.759999999999
there

5294.159 --> 5300.799999999999
just to make heliocentrists realize

5297.76 --> 5302.96
how incredibly important it is to never

5300.8 --> 5304.639
wander away from helios centrist

5302.96 --> 5306.719
thinking because then

5304.639 --> 5308.8
you end up with the moon being green

5306.719 --> 5312.4800000000005
cheese that levels are stupid

5308.8 --> 5312.4800000000005
that's exactly why they put that there

5319.199 --> 5326.0
a rabbit on the moon what

5323.679 --> 5326.0
what

5335.44 --> 5344.239
okay juan muzzle william herschel

5340.08 --> 5344.239
right okay

5348.84 --> 5351.84
sure

5352.48 --> 5356.799999999999
yeah well if you make a silly claim like

5354.96 --> 5360.0
that that's not gonna be too great for

5356.8 --> 5360.0
your career for sure

5360.56 --> 5364.320000000001
even though it's like oh look it's more

5363.12 --> 5367.36
mystery oh

5364.32 --> 5369.28
more mystery we have to think about

5367.36 --> 5371.199
how the moon is exactly a physical

5369.28 --> 5373.92
object and what is there what was there

5371.199 --> 5376.0
in the past what are the mysteries

5373.92 --> 5378.2390000000005
right beneath the surface for us to

5376.0 --> 5381.199
explore when we assume that the

5378.239 --> 5384.879999999999
iliocentric model is exactly as it is

5381.199 --> 5385.678999999999
yeah that's like kind of makes me think

5384.88 --> 5388.4800000000005
that

5385.679 --> 5390.32
william herschel would be cia or

5388.48 --> 5392.879999999999
something

5390.32 --> 5394.239
i don't know who william herschel is but

5392.88 --> 5397.1990000000005
when you start saying

5394.239 --> 5399.199
nonsense like oh the plasma vapor or

5397.199 --> 5402.5599999999995
some thingy on the moon

5399.199 --> 5405.199
then that is like a big red flag to me

5402.56 --> 5407.4400000000005
like okay this person is making up [ __ ]

5405.199 --> 5408.879999999999
within the heliocentric concept which

5407.44 --> 5411.5199999999995
makes him very much

5408.88 --> 5411.52
suspect

5419.52 --> 5425.120000000001
yeah don't try that terra 306 you're not

5422.48 --> 5425.12
ready for that

5427.36 --> 5435.839999999999
yeah no fed computer meltdown

5431.28 --> 5435.84
that's right neil

5475.44 --> 5479.199

5477.12 --> 5480.239
did you did you get stupid and put on

5479.199 --> 5491.839999999999
the gas mask

5480.239 --> 5491.839999999999
neil like you said you would

5494.639 --> 5497.28
okay good

5499.84 --> 5505.84
snowstorm all right

5508.719 --> 5513.52
flat side no you can't take a balloon to

5512.48 --> 5516.718999999999
the moon

5513.52 --> 5518.639
you can take nothing to the moon because

5516.719 --> 5521.04
in that train of thinking you're

5518.639 --> 5524.639
presuming the moon is a place to take

5521.04 --> 5528.48
things to it's not it's just a visual

5524.639 --> 5531.52
apparition of light like a holographic

5528.48 --> 5534.32
sinion signature

5531.52 --> 5536.080000000001
what you see when you looked straight

5534.32 --> 5547.84
into the direction from which

5536.08 --> 5547.84
the moonlight comes towards you

5555.29 --> 5558.319

wouldn't you

5619.92 --> 5626.4
you got youtube channels just

5623.6 --> 5627.6
make it happen play it on your channel

5626.4 --> 5631.839999999999
and

5627.6 --> 5631.84
yeah people will find it

5636.56 --> 5640.719
the world is going crazy no no the world

5638.639 --> 5645.84
was always crazy

5640.719 --> 5645.84
it's just more apparent now

5656.4 --> 5662.719
you know that crazy people are crazy

5659.76 --> 5663.92
you don't know it until the craziness

5662.719 --> 5666.8
starts to reveal

5663.92 --> 5668.639
itself but the craziness was always

5666.8 --> 5673.84
there

5668.639 --> 5673.84
that's how it works

5682.32 --> 5687.119
most normal people are just crazy people

5685.28 --> 5701.84
that suppress the crazy

5687.119 --> 5701.839999999999
you know that's reality

5712.08 --> 5718.88
it's all theater neil there is

5715.76 --> 5722.8
no votes there is no parties

5718.88 --> 5727.679
it's a singular monolithic

5722.8 --> 5731.1990000000005
pyramidal system one party

5727.679 --> 5734.4800000000005
one party system neil you understand

5731.199 --> 5735.5199999999995
it's all fake the entire thing even the

5734.48 --> 5739.5199999999995
suggestion

5735.52 --> 5742.56
of the votes that it's decided upon

5739.52 --> 5743.6
it's decided and it was decided to

5742.56 --> 5746.56
demonstrate

5743.6 --> 5747.1990000000005
yeah we can literally rig the [ __ ] out

5746.56 --> 5750.080000000001
of things

5747.199 --> 5750.879999999999

nothing squirt all day long panic be sad

5754.239 --> 5758.638999999999
be

5754.48 --> 5761.36
angry whatever it doesn't matter

5758.639 --> 5763.04
that's what the demonstration is about

5761.36 --> 5764.719
to show the american people

5763.04 --> 5766.56
hey america do you think you're free

5764.719 --> 5769.76
well [ __ ]

5766.56 --> 5771.84
you you're wrong you're not free

5769.76 --> 5773.1990000000005
you've just been indoctrinated with the

5771.84 --> 5776.32
idea you're free

5773.199 --> 5779.44
so you wouldn't do anything about it

5776.32 --> 5781.44
and now you're there and you're not free

5779.44 --> 5783.36
it's all [ __ ] it's a one-party

5781.44 --> 5786.08
system you've been played

5783.36 --> 5788.0
you're still being played and you just

5786.08 --> 5791.5199999999995
just squirt yourself to death

5788.0 --> 5794.0
nobody cares it's gonna happen exactly

5791.52 --> 5794.8
how they planned it will and there's

5794.0 --> 5798.239
nothing

5794.8 --> 5812.159000000001
you can do to change it nothing

5798.239 --> 5815.28
that's the truth

5812.159 --> 5816.96
either you submit as a full-on mind

5815.28 --> 5819.44
control slave

5816.96 --> 5820.88
you hang around in between not knowing

5819.44 --> 5824.4
where you are

5820.88 --> 5827.6
or you basically go back to

5824.4 --> 5828.4
the original offset of america and just

5827.6 --> 5831.119000000001
say okay

5828.4 --> 5832.879999999999
this american government is now hostile

5831.119 --> 5836.159
against the people that means we

5832.88 --> 5840.400000000001
kill them all with our second amendment

5836.159 --> 5843.5199999999995
oh nobody's doing it because

5840.4 --> 5844.879999999999
and millions of hours of reason to give

5843.52 --> 5846.88
why not to do

5844.88 --> 5849.4400000000005
what is basically the number one

5846.88 --> 5852.400000000001
constitution rule

5849.44 --> 5853.44
yeah so it's done there is no more

5852.4 --> 5855.839999999999
america

5853.44 --> 5857.04
because everybody in america has

5855.84 --> 5859.76
basically

5857.04 --> 5860.48
ignored the number one constitutional

5859.76 --> 5862.719
rule

5860.48 --> 5863.759999999999
and so it's over and it has been over a

5862.719 --> 5865.76
long time

5863.76 --> 5868.719
it's just a whole couple of generations

5865.76 --> 5871.679
that spend half their lifetime

5868.719 --> 5874.08
making up excuses why not to do the

5871.679 --> 5876.0
thing that they need to do

5874.08 --> 5878.639
right it's become a whole culture of

5876.0 --> 5879.84
making excuses why not to do what you

5878.639 --> 5882.32
need to do

5879.84 --> 5884.08
and that's been going on for over a

5882.32 --> 5888.639
hundred years now

5884.08 --> 5888.639
so yeah good luck with that

5895.679 --> 5899.76
oh trump will do this and trump will do

5897.84 --> 5902.4800000000005
that and you guys will be

5899.76 --> 5904.400000000001
talking about what must happen what will

5902.48 --> 5906.08
be done this will be done because i read

5904.4 --> 5909.119
it in the media somewhere

5906.08 --> 5912.48
it's not like it's a completely

5909.119 --> 5912.719
scripted event every freaking detail of

5912.48 --> 5915.199
it

5912.719 --> 5916.4800000000005
both sides every detail it's just in a

5915.199 --> 5918.96
playbook

5916.48 --> 5921.28
so it really means that you read

5918.96 --> 5922.96
somewhere that somebody in that system

5921.28 --> 5923.84
told you oh this is going to happen this

5922.96 --> 5925.92
is gonna happen

5923.84 --> 5927.360000000001
yeah just like a soap opera this is

5925.92 --> 5929.28
gonna happen this is gonna happen

5927.36 --> 5930.799999999999
stay tuned everybody this is gonna

5929.28 --> 5932.5599999999995
happen there's something

5930.8 --> 5934.320000000001
that will happen you don't have to do

5932.56 --> 5937.1990000000005
anything just wait we'll do it

5934.32 --> 5938.239
just trust us yeah yeah yeah that's the

5937.199 --> 5941.44
game

5938.239 --> 5944.879999999999
and everybody falls for it everybody

5941.44 --> 5944.879999999999
i'm not falling for it anymore

5946.96 --> 5950.88
yeah trump is on your side he has the

5949.28 --> 5954.08
constitution he's gonna do

5950.88 --> 5957.6
something unless he's not

5954.08 --> 5958.32
and he hasn't really so it's all just

5957.6 --> 5959.76
blah blah blah

5958.32 --> 5962.32
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

5959.76 --> 5964.0
blah blah yeah i'm not going for the

5962.32 --> 5967.28
blah blah blah blah blah blah

5964.0 --> 5970.32
until i literally see people getting

5967.28 --> 5971.759999999999
executed for their crimes right it's all

5970.32 --> 5975.599999999999
blah blah blah blah blah blah

5971.76 --> 5978.88
i'm so special i'm the special president

5975.6 --> 5980.0
i am constitutional even though i don't

5978.88 --> 5982.159000000001
give a [ __ ]

5980.0 --> 5984.719
actually about the constitution when

5982.159 --> 5988.239
it's not profitable

5984.719 --> 5989.28
for the budget yeah yeah it's all

5988.239 --> 5995.04
[ __ ]

5989.28 --> 5997.84
it's all [ __ ]

5995.04 --> 6000.4
is the content on youtube scripted by

5997.84 --> 6003.6
the control what

6000.4 --> 6008.159
what you mean entirety of youtube that's

6003.6 --> 6011.280000000001
weird why would you say that

6008.159 --> 6012.32
i'm not scripted i literally don't have

6011.28 --> 6014.48
a script

6012.32 --> 6015.92
i'm not reading anything i don't plan

6014.48 --> 6020.4
ahead i literally

6015.92 --> 6020.4
just say things on the spot

6020.56 --> 6023.84
so no

6039.84 --> 6051.84
yeah i can do better

6061.6 --> 6067.04
yeah there's plenty of people that are

6063.52 --> 6070.0
script only like simon and exactly

6067.04 --> 6071.5199999999995
just people that just don't know how to

6070.0 --> 6074.639
improvise

6071.52 --> 6077.6
why because they don't have

6074.639 --> 6080.400000000001
honesty in order to do that they just

6077.6 --> 6083.1990000000005
have to carefully

6080.4 --> 6084.48
ride out the paths and the trains of

6083.199 --> 6086.879999999999
thought

6084.48 --> 6089.28
that they're going to take because they

6086.88 --> 6089.84
can't just maneuver freely because they

6089.28 --> 6092.159
are

6089.84 --> 6095.360000000001
they have built a world of lies around

6092.159 --> 6100.159
themselves and they constantly have to

6095.36 --> 6102.639
ensure that none of it is revealed

6100.159 --> 6104.239
so then they yeah become scripted that's

6102.639 --> 6106.0
exactly how that happens

6104.239 --> 6107.5199999999995
so that's what the news is by the way

6106.0 --> 6110.8
too it's exactly that it's

6107.52 --> 6111.679
all lies everything is medea medea all

6110.8 --> 6115.119000000001
scripted all

6111.679 --> 6116.719
lies all synchronized nobody in there

6115.119 --> 6119.119
even cares anymore

6116.719 --> 6121.6
about what the truth is they just read

6119.119 --> 6123.92
the freaking script

6121.6 --> 6126.08
just follow the playbook they follow the

6123.92 --> 6128.96
objectives

6126.08 --> 6130.639
that's what they prioritize accuracy of

6128.96 --> 6134.2390000000005
the script they read

6130.639 --> 6138.159000000001
and the priorities the objectives of

6134.239 --> 6141.119
the system their system the media system

6138.159 --> 6141.119
that they follow

6145.76 --> 6149.76
but that doesn't mean that every video

6148.56 --> 6152.4800000000005
output everywhere

6149.76 --> 6155.1990000000005
is always scripted but you can see if

6152.48 --> 6155.199
it's scripted

6155.6 --> 6163.76
if it's not scripted you can literally

6158.639 --> 6177.84
interact with it you can literally

6163.76 --> 6177.84
test it test a person's response in chat

6181.6 --> 6189.4400000000005
neil okay

6184.96 --> 6192.56
that yeah sure

6189.44 --> 6196.0
but seriously neil like america

6192.56 --> 6197.1990000000005
united states the way the politicians

6196.0 --> 6199.36
have become

6197.199 --> 6201.879999999999
and a lot of things going down there in

6199.36 --> 6205.44
general it's so bad now it's so

6201.88 --> 6207.84
unbelievably bad it's just a whole bunch

6205.44 --> 6209.28
of a whole range of people that's really

6207.84 --> 6212.400000000001
just gotta

6209.28 --> 6216.0
gotta die in some way like

6212.4 --> 6219.36
just just to stop the president

6216.0 --> 6223.679
from continuing of absolute demonic

6219.36 --> 6226.239
mind control lies without any limits

6223.679 --> 6228.159
because that precedent is set in the

6226.239 --> 6230.4
united states for some time

6228.159 --> 6231.199
the only way to stop that is by

6230.4 --> 6235.839999999999
literally

6231.199 --> 6239.119
killing the people that do that

6235.84 --> 6240.96
it's the only way to stop it because

6239.119 --> 6243.04
otherwise it's going to spread

6240.96 --> 6244.4
other people will start doing it too

6243.04 --> 6248.56
it's like oh

6244.4 --> 6252.08
we can do this now okay okay

6248.56 --> 6254.159000000001
then i'll just go full in as well i'll

6252.08 --> 6257.6
start to ambitiously make my

6254.159 --> 6260.159
own line narrative within the framework

6257.6 --> 6262.400000000001
system and start adding more [ __ ]

6260.159 --> 6265.44
more mind control on top of it

6262.4 --> 6268.719
that's what happens when you don't

6265.44 --> 6272.719
take it down when you don't stop

6268.719 --> 6273.6
the precedent of absolute mind control

6272.719 --> 6276.4
and lies

6273.6 --> 6277.84
without limits that's what happens when

6276.4 --> 6281.119
you let that go

6277.84 --> 6284.719
and it's been let go for some time

6281.119 --> 6286.88
quite a few quite a long time

6284.719 --> 6288.0
it's growing it's gonna grow worse much

6286.88 --> 6291.1990000000005
much worse so

6288.0 --> 6292.159
much worse that eventually you will not

6291.199 --> 6294.4
have choice

6292.159 --> 6297.92
but to literally start shooting people

6294.4 --> 6297.92
just to try and survive

6299.6 --> 6303.92
so yeah it will continue until it finds

6302.639 --> 6307.04
a bloody end and there is

6303.92 --> 6309.4400000000005
nothing nothing that can prevent it

6307.04 --> 6310.32
you don't need to organize anything to

6309.44 --> 6314.839999999999
stop it

6310.32 --> 6319.119
or to let it become bloody it is

6314.84 --> 6319.119000000001
inevitable no matter what

6328.84 --> 6333.4400000000005
bilderberg is all old news these are all

6332.0 --> 6335.6
just think tanks

6333.44 --> 6337.119
it's the people at top right while the

6335.6 --> 6338.96
people at the top

6337.119 --> 6343.28
they will just continue doing what they

6338.96 --> 6343.28
do they will continue making the plans

6343.6 --> 6350.88
but yeah they've always been there

6347.08 --> 6354.88
always they have always

6350.88 --> 6357.6
been there always

6354.88 --> 6358.08
since the beginning of human history

6357.6 --> 6361.360000000001
people

6358.08 --> 6365.04
like that have always been there

6361.36 --> 6367.36
always do you understand so you can't

6365.04 --> 6369.28
remove them they are not the specific

6367.36 --> 6373.28
people i'm talking no i'm talking about

6369.28 --> 6376.88
the people in society that basically

6373.28 --> 6379.5199999999995
take the the smoky torch and start

6376.88 --> 6380.32
saying okay we're just gonna make up

6379.52 --> 6383.52
complete

6380.32 --> 6386.0
lies and actively indoctrinate people

6383.52 --> 6387.360000000001
to [ __ ] things up more and get some

6386.0 --> 6391.04
money out of it

6387.36 --> 6394.239
that those are the the people that

6391.04 --> 6396.4
take those plans of the controllers that

6394.239 --> 6398.879999999999
have always been there and actually

6396.4 --> 6400.08
execute them so they're the ones that

6398.88 --> 6403.1990000000005
actually do it that

6400.08 --> 6404.0
karmically are responsible you

6403.199 --> 6407.04
understand

6404.0 --> 6410.48
the elites that make the plans you can

6407.04 --> 6413.6
never get rid of them do you understand

6410.48 --> 6414.4
yeah it hurts let it sink through you

6413.6 --> 6417.84
can

6414.4 --> 6420.239
never get rid of them you understand

6417.84 --> 6422.88
it's only the people that actually

6420.239 --> 6424.959999999999
execute those plants

6422.88 --> 6427.28
because they are the ones karmically

6424.96 --> 6429.199
responsible and they know it

6427.28 --> 6432.159
and they'll double down forever because

6429.199 --> 6432.159
they can never stop

6432.239 --> 6443.839999999999
do you understand that's the situation

6449.73 --> 6457.178999999999
[Music]

6457.76 --> 6460.4800000000005
hey samson

6468.48 --> 6486.08
what are you talking about flat side

6484.56 --> 6489.6
what you're going to make me choose a

6486.08 --> 6489.6
dichotomy why

6489.76 --> 6493.119000000001
oh really the next year what's the first

6491.679 --> 6494.56
thing you're going to do oh is this

6493.119 --> 6495.759999999999
going to happen or that going to happen

6494.56 --> 6499.4400000000005
how about

6495.76 --> 6504.159000000001
[ __ ] all of that i'm gonna happen

6499.44 --> 6512.36
our win is what's gonna happen 2021.

6504.159 --> 6516.0
how about that

6512.36 --> 6516.0
2021 right yeah

6516.719 --> 6518.88
no

6521.52 --> 6526.159000000001
to 2021 is the year where american

6524.8 --> 6529.28
politics is probably

6526.159 --> 6530.239
going to be destroyed forever and it

6529.28 --> 6533.5199999999995
might even go

6530.239 --> 6536.48
thus far that they will give

6533.52 --> 6537.040000000001
up the facade where they will literally

6536.48 --> 6542.239
just

6537.04 --> 6545.36
tell people we're uniting the party

6542.239 --> 6546.48
we have to unite against the outsider

6545.36 --> 6549.5199999999995
threat of

6546.48 --> 6552.4
china whatever and

6549.52 --> 6553.52
biden and trump are gonna be hand in

6552.4 --> 6555.5199999999995
hand

6553.52 --> 6557.040000000001
that sort of [ __ ] that's what i think is

6555.52 --> 6557.679
going to happen i think that it's going

6557.04 --> 6560.56
to be the

6557.679 --> 6563.04
end of the traditional dichotomy-based

6560.56 --> 6565.280000000001
political system in the united states

6563.04 --> 6566.4
because it's become so convoluted so

6565.28 --> 6569.44
contrived

6566.4 --> 6572.638999999999
so messy they're just gonna give that

6569.44 --> 6575.839999999999
up because nobody gives a [ __ ] anymore

6572.639 --> 6582.8
or they need to stop it i don't know

6575.84 --> 6587.119000000001
but like serious

6582.8 --> 6590.320000000001
there would would outside of

6587.119 --> 6593.759999999999
how about you properly write english

6590.32 --> 6593.759999999999
tiny one more how about that

6595.679 --> 6599.119
right here we go again here's your

6597.28 --> 6602.5599999999995
opportunity

6599.119 --> 6611.839999999999
take your wrench away i'll give it back

6602.56 --> 6611.84
to you as soon as you give me the sign

6615.599 --> 6618.639
tell me when you're done

6620.719 --> 6625.84
not thanks tell me when you're done

6637.04 --> 6644.17
all right yes

6641.28 --> 6646.239
between here we go again and me

6644.17 --> 6653.84
[Music]

6646.239 --> 6653.839999999999
i gotcha i got you

6662.32 --> 6668.4
you're gonna do what start a movement

6666.08 --> 6671.119
oh really how are you gonna do that are

6668.4 --> 6673.598999999999
we gonna start a movement at this point

6671.119 --> 6676.08
you can't do that it doesn't work

6673.599 --> 6676.08
anymore

6678.96 --> 6682.719
i'm fed up okay so you just need a group

6681.36 --> 6685.92
to squirt with

6682.719 --> 6686.2390000000005
squirt your frustrations away to at

6685.92 --> 6689.28
least

6686.239 --> 6691.44
assert some notion of freedom write an

6689.28 --> 6694.0
idea because you don't have any anymore

6691.44 --> 6696.159
just just saying it's really cute you

6694.0 --> 6698.32
have some things written on paper

6696.159 --> 6699.44
called the constitution but yeah the

6698.32 --> 6702.639
government's just

6699.44 --> 6709.839999999999
ignoring that it's just ignoring it

6702.639 --> 6709.84
so you don't really have anything

6711.679 --> 6715.84
you're taking more to them okay good

6713.28 --> 6717.679
luck you do realize in every war

6715.84 --> 6719.92
especially in the beginning

6717.679 --> 6721.52
it's usually just a lot of people that's

6719.92 --> 6723.52
just gonna die

6721.52 --> 6726.400000000001
that's it if you're if you're ready for

6723.52 --> 6729.1990000000005
that that's fine

6726.4 --> 6730.0
but that's usually how it ends up if you

6729.199 --> 6733.199
can't

6730.0 --> 6733.92
handle it anymore and you're taking the

6733.199 --> 6736.48
actions

6733.92 --> 6738.08
then usually just you end up dying just

6736.48 --> 6740.08
saying

6738.08 --> 6742.8
i'm not joining you well maybe because

6740.08 --> 6744.88
i'm not an american

6742.8 --> 6747.52
i have my own country to deal with and

6744.88 --> 6751.4400000000005
we have similar problems

6747.52 --> 6753.679
although not as severe as in the us

6751.44 --> 6754.5599999999995
because the us is just literally

6753.679 --> 6757.599
starting to

6754.56 --> 6760.320000000001
yeah like they're not even

6757.599 --> 6761.119000000001
trying to trick people anymore it's just

6760.32 --> 6764.96
outright

6761.119 --> 6767.598999999999
overt communist slavery actions and just

6764.96 --> 6770.2390000000005
ignoring the law and the constitution

6767.599 --> 6770.2390000000005
entirely

6772.0 --> 6777.599
not talking about american

6775.44 --> 6779.759999999999
well you can't have a war you can't have

6777.599 --> 6781.1990000000005
a war or a revolution if you don't even

6779.76 --> 6784.320000000001
have your own country under your

6781.199 --> 6785.919999999999
control so no

6784.32 --> 6788.4
can't take the world if you don't have a

6785.92 --> 6788.4
country

6789.04 --> 6792.48
going worldwide with your movement okay

6791.119 --> 6795.28
have you tried

6792.48 --> 6795.28
bertaria

6801.44 --> 6807.839999999999
i want all the elite you don't even know

6804.0 --> 6807.84
who the elite is

6821.36 --> 6826.0
right yeah roger i heard it there's a

6824.719 --> 6829.28
vote in the netherlands it's

6826.0 --> 6832.8
if it's going to be a [ __ ]

6829.28 --> 6836.5599999999995
then yeah like if that vote

6832.8 --> 6838.400000000001
is not gonna go well there's probably

6836.56 --> 6840.719
gonna be a lot of rowdiness

6838.4 --> 6842.239
in the netherlands and it's probably

6840.719 --> 6845.52
going to mean the end of the

6842.239 --> 6846.799999999999
cabinet as it is because if there is

6845.52 --> 6850.88
rigging in that [ __ ]

6846.8 --> 6853.360000000001
and they're gonna put in a bad cabinet

6850.88 --> 6854.4800000000005
then we got such massive problems then

6853.36 --> 6857.92
we basically

6854.48 --> 6858.5599999999995
will have an effective coup where where

6857.92 --> 6860.4
the people

6858.56 --> 6862.0
literally won't be able to change

6860.4 --> 6866.879999999999
anything anymore because it's

6862.0 --> 6866.88
completely under the globalist control

6867.119 --> 6870.719
it's very dangerous situation

6872.96 --> 6877.36
all right well good luck with that neil

6875.04 --> 6879.44
who knows maybe

6877.36 --> 6881.199
i think you haven't really thought it

6879.44 --> 6883.04
through too well

6881.199 --> 6884.239
because you're not the first to think up

6883.04 --> 6888.0
something like this but

6884.239 --> 6891.759999999999
hey who knows maybe

6888.0 --> 6895.28
it is time for that just saying that

6891.76 --> 6897.92
the whole maga thing was kind of that

6895.28 --> 6900.4
but now it's not anymore because now

6897.92 --> 6903.52
it's just a political apparatus

6900.4 --> 6906.719
for a cog in the machine in the false

6903.52 --> 6909.040000000001
dichotomy just saying

6906.719 --> 6909.04
you know

6925.84 --> 6931.52
right i'm gonna round out the show

6929.199 --> 6932.96
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6931.52 --> 6935.280000000001
liked this show i thought it was pretty

6932.96 --> 6937.52
decent

6935.28 --> 6940.639
good statements here and there i'm

6937.52 --> 6940.639
probably going to watch it back

6940.8 --> 6944.639
i did so it was yesterday's show and it

6942.48 --> 6947.119
was pretty good so

6944.639 --> 6948.719
it's weird i don't always think that my

6947.119 --> 6951.759999999999
shows are that great

6948.719 --> 6953.92
but they're really not that bad it's

6951.76 --> 6957.1990000000005
maybe it's just that i'm kind of sick of

6953.92 --> 6960.4
my own show because i do it every day

6957.199 --> 6961.04
this is every freaking day and then it's

6960.4 --> 6963.28
like not

6961.04 --> 6965.92
that like oh yeah it's good enough but

6963.28 --> 6968.48
it's not like oh yeah my show

6965.92 --> 6969.119
i don't know maybe i just need a break

6968.48 --> 6971.199
again

6969.119 --> 6974.159
or something it does always help when i

6971.199 --> 6976.638999999999
kind of stay away for whatever reason

6974.159 --> 6978.08
then like the spiritual fuel just starts

6976.639 --> 6981.28
stacking up

6978.08 --> 6981.28
and i get all fired up

6981.44 --> 6984.5599999999995
but anyway it was still a good show i

6983.199 --> 6988.0
think

6984.56 --> 6990.159000000001
