over everything

102.88 --> 108.0

135.52 --> 140.8

3rd of may 2021

151.36 --> 156.16000000000003
probably a little early for a lot of

153.2 --> 160.16
people especially in the us

156.16 --> 160.16
i'll see who gets in here

168.84 --> 174.64000000000001
right

170.08 --> 174.64000000000001
yeah yesterday uh

174.72 --> 178.0
what yeah the flat earth early bird show

176.72 --> 181.35999999999999
what's good

178.0 --> 185.519
uh premiere from friday

181.36 --> 189.20000000000002
was also good

185.519 --> 191.519
uh and pretty much the rest of most of

189.2 --> 193.76
the day

191.519 --> 194.56
i've been having like a call with rasta

193.76 --> 199.35999999999999
hat that

194.56 --> 203.2
i got lasted like over five hours

199.36 --> 205.59900000000002
so yeah that was pretty much the rest of

203.2 --> 205.599
my day

207.04 --> 215.519
didn't go to bed that late

210.08 --> 215.519
so yeah i feel pretty arrested

218.4 --> 220.64000000000001
huh

221.68 --> 227.519
rusta had had a lot of ideas

225.12 --> 228.239
on what i could do like even with the

227.519 --> 230.56
show he

228.239 --> 230.56
kind of

231.44 --> 238.239
uh handed me the idea of well of

234.879 --> 241.599
that what is it i got channel promoted

238.239 --> 245.59900000000002
advertisement and i've seen it out there

241.599 --> 248.56
just to think about it but before i

245.599 --> 250.159
would actually do such things i don't

248.56 --> 254.31900000000002
know i need to feel it out

250.159 --> 256.639
and ask you guys what yeah because i

254.319 --> 259.759
haven't really done that

256.639 --> 263.52
too much but i might somewhere

259.759 --> 265.52000000000004
start to do that yeah

263.52 --> 267.68
just to see what it would be like and

265.52 --> 270.32
hey i have a daily show which should be

267.68 --> 270.32
appealing

271.36 --> 275.199
uh anyway first in chat slow mo moon

274.32 --> 278.639
buggy

275.199 --> 284.88
gaining wisdom good to see you both

278.639 --> 288.72
huh right i got a special drink

284.88 --> 288.71999999999997
that yeah i bumped into

288.8 --> 291.91900000000004
at the organic grocery store it was in

291.6 --> 295.44
the

291.919 --> 297.28
discounted corner

295.44 --> 298.96
and i yeah i thought it was very

297.28 --> 304.55999999999995
appealing because it

298.96 --> 309.039
was only like one euro but also because

304.56 --> 311.84
guess why might recognize a certain

309.039 --> 311.84
thing on there

319.039 --> 326.479
right yeah it's a black swan

324.0 --> 329.68
is the black swan organic drink it's

326.479 --> 333.199
it's just lemon tonic really

329.68 --> 336.32
but i thought it was appropriate

333.199 --> 336.32
like why not

336.84 --> 342.79999999999995
hmm

339.84 --> 342.79999999999995
and it's pretty nice

343.89 --> 347.03999999999996
[Music]

347.44 --> 353.84
so i got a black swan drink

357.52 --> 361.52
with whatever it is wild bolivian china

360.56 --> 364.16
bark

361.52 --> 365.44
never even heard of that but it's in

364.16 --> 367.36
there

365.44 --> 369.28
and there's a black swan on it and i

367.36 --> 372.24
thought yeah that's the drink that i'm

369.28 --> 376.88
gonna have on the show

372.24 --> 376.88
besides green tea which i also have

379.039 --> 383.039
yeah hello turret3o6

392.84 --> 395.84
uh

398.479 --> 403.919
so what have you guys been up to

401.919 --> 406.479
i haven't really well because of that

403.919 --> 409.44
call also and it was a good call

406.479 --> 410.15999999999997
i haven't really been looking out there

409.44 --> 413.759
i don't know

410.16 --> 413.759
what everybody else has been up to

420.639 --> 423.919
i see paula did also have a live stream

423.28 --> 427.039
but i

423.919 --> 429.35999999999996
missed out on that completely

427.039 --> 429.36
uh

430.08 --> 433.68
that it's been mostly

434.24 --> 438.639
nathan oakley's premieres

443.199 --> 448.56
so yeah i don't really know what

445.039 --> 448.56
everybody else has been doing in the

448.84 --> 453.11999999999995
sunday

451.44 --> 455.52
so i'm kind of a blank slate this

453.12 --> 455.52
morning

455.919 --> 462.08
uh and i'm up for talking about well

458.88 --> 462.08
whatever you guys like

462.88 --> 468.09
not particularly filled up about ooh

465.759 --> 471.22
subject

468.09 --> 471.21999999999997
[Music]

471.759 --> 477.759
been flicking through some new

473.36 --> 479.759
situations but yeah it's kind of the

477.759 --> 482.319
things that are not really super

479.759 --> 482.319
interesting

488.0 --> 494.879
oh right i did see like a

491.199 --> 494.879
a meme word out there

497.44 --> 502.879
she had this for like feminist extreme

501.039 --> 504.31899999999996
feminists that are like obsessed with

502.879 --> 507.52000000000004
that [ __ ]

504.319 --> 508.879
woke stuff she hardest i thought that

507.52 --> 513.1999999999999
was kind of

508.879 --> 514.88
funny smart maybe a little corny

513.2 --> 517.36
it's probably not a terminology i'm

514.88 --> 520.08
gonna use but still like

517.36 --> 521.12
yeah that that's a pretty smart

520.08 --> 524.24
connection there

521.12 --> 526.48
this is whoever came up with that

524.24 --> 526.48
uh

527.519 --> 534.48
who shows our live our messages

531.04 --> 538.0
in effie the live chat

534.48 --> 538.0
what do you mean tara 306

542.16 --> 549.8389999999999
who shows what

551.6 --> 556.24
i think that from what i've noticed

554.0 --> 557.12
nathan has kind of taken out like the

556.24 --> 561.279
live text

557.12 --> 565.6
in on screen because

561.279 --> 569.12
he likes to edit clips together

565.6 --> 569.519
oh oh shows a yeah oh well territory

569.12 --> 572.16
that

569.519 --> 573.76
right the chat approval well that's done

572.16 --> 576.7199999999999
by people with wrenches so that's

573.76 --> 580.399
usually going to be me

576.72 --> 581.839
i hang around the fed premieres and all

580.399 --> 585.36
that and the live chat

581.839 --> 586.8800000000001
often to approve messages sometimes i

585.36 --> 589.519
don't even

586.88 --> 590.8
watch the show or listen to it i just go

589.519 --> 593.6
there in the chat and just

590.8 --> 594.7199999999999
approve people's messages because a lot

593.6 --> 597.36
of them get help

594.72 --> 597.36
in the chat

597.92 --> 607.92
nathan also does it i noticed

605.76 --> 609.68
but yeah i've been approving a lot of

607.92 --> 612.4799999999999
held back messages on

609.68 --> 612.4799999999999
on chats

613.839 --> 618.0
please approve fast well why don't you

616.24 --> 620.399
try to figure out what is

618.0 --> 622.64
making you making those messages hold

620.399 --> 625.2
back and try to prevent using that sort

622.64 --> 625.1999999999999
of language

625.36 --> 629.6
i think that would work to your

630.839 --> 633.839
advantage

637.44 --> 641.9200000000001
right it's only certain types of people

639.36 --> 644.0790000000001
that take a certain tone use certain

641.92 --> 646.3199999999999
words that typically have their messages

644.079 --> 660.3199999999999
held back constantly so

646.32 --> 663.2
that should be telling

660.32 --> 665.44
clean messages also get help no no they

663.2 --> 667.279
don't

665.44 --> 668.48
or they wouldn't be get they wouldn't be

667.279 --> 670.88
held

668.48 --> 670.88
no it's

671.76 --> 675.8389999999999
it's just not true terror 306.

695.839 --> 702.0790000000001
okay okay well if you sometimes well do

698.959 --> 705.5999999999999
you have an exact example of a message

702.079 --> 709.76
with no abuse that gets then got hold

705.6 --> 709.76
held do you have an example of that

712.0 --> 717.839
because i've never seen that

728.88 --> 745.8389999999999
alright right anyway um

747.839 --> 759.839
wind is blowing the blossom all over the

750.88 --> 759.8389999999999
place down there look at that

764.48 --> 770.72
it's a pretty special site especially

767.76 --> 770.72
when a gust of wind

770.839 --> 773.839
hits

779.92 --> 785.279
dude i don't i wouldn't know man uh i'm

782.8 --> 786.56
blocked over at jiren's youtube the only

785.279 --> 790.399
place i can comment

786.56 --> 801.8389999999999
is on the d live chat

790.399 --> 801.839
so i don't know

826.839 --> 829.839
right

830.56 --> 836.4799999999999
youtube live chat kind of sucks yeah

833.76 --> 838.24
it could definitely be better it's just

836.48 --> 840.5600000000001
that they've been

838.24 --> 841.6800000000001
maneuvering the way it works and all

840.56 --> 844.0
that

841.68 --> 846.8
a lot of the time a lot of times now and

844.0 --> 846.8
it's yeah

849.279 --> 854.32
it's it's a lot more maintenance these

852.0 --> 854.32
days

854.639 --> 871.6
ah hey stallion 8012

858.24 --> 876.399
how am i doing yeah i'm doing fine

871.6 --> 878.72
and yeah thanks the saturday night the

876.399 --> 880.56
night i'll show ya it was it was pretty

878.72 --> 884.0
cool

880.56 --> 887.279
glad i did that it's a pretty long

884.0 --> 889.04
stream too two hours 45 minutes or

887.279 --> 890.959
something

889.04 --> 893.04
but yeah i'm glad you enjoyed it and

890.959 --> 899.8389999999999
others too and it's good to do a show

893.04 --> 899.8389999999999
like that again

902.8 --> 909.68
any any comments perhaps about it

905.92 --> 909.68
about this situation

910.24 --> 915.92
brian's points and well analysis of

913.68 --> 927.8389999999999
whatever randy was trying to achieve

915.92 --> 927.8389999999999
any comments on it

937.279 --> 941.12
or anything else going down like glow

939.519 --> 944.399
busters or something i don't even know

941.12 --> 944.399
if there was a globe busters

944.639 --> 949.44
it's like every sunday right i haven't

947.68 --> 955.8389999999999
watched it in a long time so i don't

949.44 --> 955.839
know what they're doing

956.24 --> 960.48
bring randy for that's never gonna

958.16 --> 960.48
happen

963.759 --> 969.6
that's just gonna be messy but

966.8 --> 972.079
i i don't think randy's gonna come into

969.6 --> 975.1990000000001
a call with the fed panel

972.079 --> 976.16
on there but who knows maybe he will and

975.199 --> 978.3199999999999
if he's

976.16 --> 982.16
if he's willing to do that then sure

978.32 --> 984.88
i'll i'll get him on sometime and see

982.16 --> 984.88
what we could do

985.519 --> 989.279
but it's probably going to get a little

987.199 --> 989.5999999999999
messy because i think that if randy is

989.279 --> 991.279
like

989.6 --> 993.0400000000001
in the call and so are the rest of the

991.279 --> 995.12
guys it's going to be

993.04 --> 1010.0
kind of tough for me to keep control

995.12 --> 1013.199
over the whole thing

1010.0 --> 1013.199
sunday night owl

1017.12 --> 1022.24
the megatoon wits it debate what what

1020.48 --> 1024.4
i haven't heard of that slow mo moon

1022.24 --> 1038.559
buggy when did that happen

1024.4 --> 1042.16
what about

1038.559 --> 1045.039
oh if he refuses to chat it dude

1042.16 --> 1046.0
what you need more proof territory you

1045.039 --> 1049.76
really need

1046.0 --> 1051.679
more proof like what you need a signed

1049.76 --> 1056.0
contract

1051.679 --> 1060.3200000000002
sold out ranty you need that

1056.0 --> 1060.32
dude what this is

1063.28 --> 1081.84
do we really need more evidence for that

1082.32 --> 1086.1599999999999
brian was getting his opinion across not

1085.12 --> 1089.76
over

1086.16 --> 1093.6000000000001
but way too intense and complicated well

1089.76 --> 1096.64
no i don't think so

1093.6 --> 1099.36
was not too intense it's just

1096.64 --> 1099.919
very much on the details trying to keep

1099.36 --> 1103.76
a grip

1099.919 --> 1103.76
on the complications of optics

1104.08 --> 1111.1999999999998
it's not too intense i don't think so

1108.799 --> 1112.32
but maybe that's the way you experience

1111.2 --> 1115.52
that

1112.32 --> 1118.31
hey hello snowbirds

1115.52 --> 1120.32
welcome to chat

1118.31 --> 1137.84
[Music]

1120.32 --> 1137.84
got my black swan drink

1148.84 --> 1151.84
do

1152.88 --> 1156.0
no or when i said it first that he sold

1155.12 --> 1159.84
out

1156.0 --> 1162.24
uh it's but

1159.84 --> 1163.039
okay tara 306 it's just that you said

1162.24 --> 1166.4
that oh

1163.039 --> 1168.48
get him on there to prove he sold out

1166.4 --> 1169.8400000000001
well i don't think we need any more

1168.48 --> 1172.64
proof

1169.84 --> 1172.6399999999999
at this point

1173.36 --> 1176.6399999999999
i think that's kind of blatantly obvious

1175.28 --> 1178.96
now why or

1176.64 --> 1180.72
how he did it that's a whole other

1178.96 --> 1181.919
matter but i don't think that's gonna

1180.72 --> 1185.039
come out

1181.919 --> 1186.7990000000002
on any kind of fed plus ranty panel

1185.039 --> 1188.64
situation

1186.799 --> 1190.8799999999999
what you think he's just gonna lay it

1188.64 --> 1194.24
out well maybe at some point he would i

1190.88 --> 1194.24
don't know but that would be weird

1201.6 --> 1207.84
i i wouldn't know why he would do that

1219.76 --> 1224.24
some flatties may still think he's legit

1224.48 --> 1228.0
well if they're ill informed

1231.28 --> 1237.28
or if they just like don't want to admit

1235.12 --> 1237.28
it

1240.159 --> 1244.5590000000002
because i think ranty did have quite a

1242.32 --> 1246.3999999999999
few fans when he was a flat earther or

1244.559 --> 1248.0
where he when he presented himself as a

1246.4 --> 1251.1200000000001
flat earther yeah and all of those are

1248.0 --> 1253.76
just they would rather just

1251.12 --> 1263.84
hope he like gets over it and gets back

1253.76 --> 1263.84
there's a lot of people like that

1270.72 --> 1277.52
someone in chat said your auntie's still

1273.679 --> 1282.48
undercover what do you think

1277.52 --> 1282.48
i think that could be the intention

1282.559 --> 1290.8799999999999
but why and how and

1287.36 --> 1294.7199999999998
like if he is undercover he's just

1290.88 --> 1294.72
publicly playing everyone

1297.679 --> 1303.1200000000001
like why why would you play games with

1301.44 --> 1305.2
everybody like that

1303.12 --> 1308.32
to supposedly go undercover what's he

1305.2 --> 1308.32
gonna achieve with that

1308.96 --> 1315.76
right so maybe that is like a little

1312.159 --> 1319.8400000000001
plan of his but yeah why

1315.76 --> 1319.84
and what's the point

1326.0 --> 1333.84
oh okay snowbirds cool

1343.039 --> 1348.32
right yeah sterling 12 i

1346.08 --> 1349.4399999999998
understand the idea but it's kind of

1348.32 --> 1352.8799999999999
like

1349.44 --> 1352.88
very rough comparison

1353.919 --> 1360.7990000000002
like you could say like in in star wars

1357.679 --> 1363.52
the prequels like yeah anakim

1360.799 --> 1364.48
sided with the emperor because he went

1363.52 --> 1367.84
undercover

1364.48 --> 1368.799
right yeah like the first few times that

1367.84 --> 1372.1589999999999
happens

1368.799 --> 1374.0
remember even obi-wan

1372.159 --> 1376.0
got after him like trying to convince

1374.0 --> 1377.44
him like stop doing this stop doing this

1376.0 --> 1379.039
like yeah

1377.44 --> 1380.64
you could as an outsider think that but

1379.039 --> 1382.96
he was just going undercover this is

1380.64 --> 1385.2800000000002
going somewhere it's like oh really

1382.96 --> 1386.88
so how about a few years later when he's

1385.28 --> 1389.44
literally darth vader and

1386.88 --> 1390.64
there's just the empire is he still

1389.44 --> 1394.0
under cover

1390.64 --> 1396.159
right at some point going undercover

1394.0 --> 1397.76
just doesn't matter anymore if you're

1396.159 --> 1401.2
going to be too overt

1397.76 --> 1401.2
and do too much damage

1401.6 --> 1405.9189999999999
at least too much reputation damage then

1403.76 --> 1416.32
undercover doesn't really matter anymore

1405.919 --> 1418.96
at some point

1416.32 --> 1421.279
right yeah pathfi and that's fine if

1418.96 --> 1424.559
ranty wants to leave for the ball

1421.279 --> 1426.799
and won't be returning fine who needs

1424.559 --> 1426.799
him

1427.84 --> 1431.6
if after everything he wants to get back

1430.4 --> 1434.72
on the ball well

1431.6 --> 1434.7199999999998
best of luck to you

1435.52 --> 1439.6
if that's where you want to be then go

1442.84 --> 1445.84
ahead

1456.64 --> 1465.279
what would be the glove response

1460.32 --> 1465.279
for seeing a lighthouse 20 miles away uh

1466.08 --> 1472.1589999999999
oh the globe logo response

1469.44 --> 1473.6000000000001
mirage of it all depends on which globe

1472.159 --> 1476.24
are you gonna

1473.6 --> 1479.76
refer to like rumpus would always draw

1476.24 --> 1479.76
in terrestrial refraction

1480.48 --> 1486.88
i think but hey others may

1483.76 --> 1487.2
simply avoid that i think that randy may

1486.88 --> 1490.0800000000002
be

1487.2 --> 1494.32
a vo as a glober he may be for some

1490.08 --> 1494.32
reason avoiding terrestrial refraction

1495.919 --> 1502.4
so i don't know he would just try to

1499.12 --> 1505.039
mechanically nitpick get weird

1502.4 --> 1507.8400000000001
in how it's still like over the globe

1505.039 --> 1507.84
and whatever

1511.2 --> 1515.1200000000001
so it depends on what global you're

1513.36 --> 1519.12
going to have

1515.12 --> 1519.12
to respond to such a sighting

1522.32 --> 1529.6
right but hey if you if you want to

1526.24 --> 1532.64
make such photographs make sure to also

1529.6 --> 1534.7199999999998
make notes for

1532.64 --> 1537.6000000000001
what your observation height is and and

1534.72 --> 1539.6000000000001
try to get the exact location

1537.6 --> 1540.9599999999998
for reference when you look it up on

1539.6 --> 1544.559
google earth

1540.96 --> 1545.3600000000001
google maps so you got that data about

1544.559 --> 1546.72
it

1545.36 --> 1549.52
right so that nobody's going to

1546.72 --> 1551.3600000000001
speculate about it afterwards and get it

1549.52 --> 1552.1589999999999
all wrong and it gets all confusing

1551.36 --> 1553.9189999999999
again

1552.159 --> 1556.48
so if you're going to really try to get

1553.919 --> 1558.159
like serious flat earth photography

1556.48 --> 1560.32
the horizon and things in the distance

1558.159 --> 1564.4
then make sure to get the observation

1560.32 --> 1564.3999999999999
height and the geographical location

1564.559 --> 1569.279
make notes of it per photograph per

1567.2 --> 1571.76
location

1569.279 --> 1574.32
and hey if you got something good you

1571.76 --> 1576.08
can always contact me on skype

1574.32 --> 1578.24
and send me the pictures there i'll even

1576.08 --> 1581.6789999999999
present it or if you want

1578.24 --> 1584.159
you can come on and talk about it

1581.679 --> 1585.44
to present something if you want unless

1584.159 --> 1587.1200000000001
you want to do it like on your own

1585.44 --> 1589.279
channel

1587.12 --> 1590.559
but yeah in the past i've been open for

1589.279 --> 1593.76
just people

1590.559 --> 1596.96
randomly wanting to do that

1593.76 --> 1600.8799999999999
because it is kind of fun

1596.96 --> 1604.64
huh i've had ranty over in jose

1600.88 --> 1604.64
back in the day even with that sort of

1610.84 --> 1615.039
thing

1612.799 --> 1617.52
i can't come up with any logical reason

1615.039 --> 1621.2
why ranty would go undercover

1617.52 --> 1622.96
on the ball side right as an undercover

1621.2 --> 1626.159
function

1622.96 --> 1629.44
yeah that seems kind of

1626.159 --> 1633.679
hard to figure out but

1629.44 --> 1639.1200000000001
just to go to that side for the money

1633.679 --> 1639.1200000000001
and for i guess respect among globers

1639.52 --> 1644.6399999999999
right they're very eager crowd very

1642.32 --> 1655.84
desperate for anyone championing what

1644.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
they do

1661.52 --> 1666.72
uh no terror 306 globers don't say that

1666.88 --> 1671.3600000000001
no they never say that that's silly

1673.919 --> 1684.88
hey rasta hat good to see you

1682.48 --> 1687.919
special light phenomena enabled i don't

1684.88 --> 1687.919
know what you're talking about

1694.84 --> 1697.84
306.

1708.84 --> 1711.84
so

1712.48 --> 1716.64
i i don't know where you're getting this

1714.08 --> 1720.96
from tera 306 this is just stupid

1716.64 --> 1720.96
the globers don't say that it's just

1722.84 --> 1725.84
stupid

1736.08 --> 1753.84
all right black swan drink

1739.84 --> 1753.84
this is my prop for the day

1781.6 --> 1785.279
okay it's for jokes well that's not how

1783.44 --> 1786.559
you start it out when you say globe tart

1785.279 --> 1790.64
say this kind of stuff

1786.559 --> 1790.6399999999999
they don't they never do

1792.84 --> 1795.84
so

1799.279 --> 1804.08
right i don't know why you why you need

1801.44 --> 1806.64
to make globers worse than they already

1804.08 --> 1808.8799999999999
are they're already pretty terrible

1806.64 --> 1810.96
the way they are you don't need to make

1808.88 --> 1812.88
it worse you don't need to make them

1810.96 --> 1815.6000000000001
more stupid unless you feel

1812.88 --> 1816.3990000000001
really uncomfortable about yourself and

1815.6 --> 1819.76
you need

1816.399 --> 1823.84
them in your mind to be even more stupid

1819.76 --> 1823.84
right that's not a good thing

1824.08 --> 1827.84
don't don't do that

1829.36 --> 1833.279
i don't see why you would need to do

1831.2 --> 1835.6000000000001
that

1833.279 --> 1838.24
they're just terrible the way they are

1835.6 --> 1850.32
you don't need to make it even worse

1838.24 --> 1852.559
for a joke because they're not

1850.32 --> 1856.08
i mean if you really want to see like

1852.559 --> 1858.8799999999999
one of the worst traits of globers

1856.08 --> 1859.279
globed hearts as you call it the worst

1858.88 --> 1862.0
one

1859.279 --> 1863.519
is when another glober says something a

1862.0 --> 1865.919
bit technobably

1863.519 --> 1866.88
and they'll just say yeah yeah yeah yeah

1865.919 --> 1869.3600000000001
when it's just

1866.88 --> 1870.48
outrageous what is said that is where

1869.36 --> 1872.4799999999998
ballers are like

1870.48 --> 1873.76
really ridiculous if it comes from

1872.48 --> 1876.3990000000001
another baller

1873.76 --> 1878.24
they will almost automatically approve

1876.399 --> 1881.1999999999998
anything even if it makes no

1878.24 --> 1883.039
damn sense by their own logic right

1881.2 --> 1885.1200000000001
that's where globers get silly but

1883.039 --> 1888.24
globers are never going to just

1885.12 --> 1891.12
make ridiculous claims like that

1888.24 --> 1892.32
oh you can see from one side of the

1891.12 --> 1895.039
globe to the other

1892.32 --> 1896.72
no they never say that i've never heard

1895.039 --> 1900.559
any glober say that

1896.72 --> 1903.2
ever ever not even remotely

1900.559 --> 1907.84
so it's just stupid sorry tara i don't

1903.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
think it's funny it's just stupid

1910.96 --> 1915.919
yeah but taking it three steps further

1913.76 --> 1917.12
into a place that they will never take

1915.919 --> 1921.8400000000001
it

1917.12 --> 1921.84
so this is pointless

1923.76 --> 1928.399
right they straw man flat earthers with

1927.519 --> 1930.96
that [ __ ]

1928.399 --> 1931.6789999999999
saying that oh on a flat earth you

1930.96 --> 1934.48
should see

1931.679 --> 1936.3990000000001
from one side of the disk to the other

1934.48 --> 1939.679
that's what they strawman us with

1936.399 --> 1942.1589999999999
don't sink to their level by finally

1939.679 --> 1944.64
projecting onto them that they would say

1942.159 --> 1948.0
such a thing about the globe they would

1944.64 --> 1963.8400000000001
never ever do that it's

1948.0 --> 1963.84
stupid don't do that

1967.36 --> 1970.9599999999998
i mean if a glober would say it in their

1970.159 --> 1973.519
presence

1970.96 --> 1975.519
somebody might say yeah when they didn't

1973.519 --> 1978.32
really read it well

1975.519 --> 1980.0
because they just like knew oh that's a

1978.32 --> 1981.6
globe or so it's probably correct what

1980.0 --> 1983.519
he's saying without reading it right

1981.6 --> 1985.36
that's the worst type of stupidity you

1983.519 --> 1987.44
can get out of them

1985.36 --> 1990.7199999999998
just like that time with the doctors

1987.44 --> 1994.0800000000002
what is mr sensible and

1990.72 --> 1996.08
was it mr sensible another guy and fight

1994.08 --> 1998.8799999999999
the flat earth

1996.08 --> 2000.8799999999999
about the gravity and how he's not a

1998.88 --> 2004.88
force but you can think of it as a force

2000.88 --> 2008.0800000000002
all that and fight oh yeah

2004.88 --> 2011.1200000000001
yeah that's real stupidity

2008.08 --> 2013.84
but that's not the same that's just

2011.12 --> 2014.6399999999999
not paying attention and being extremely

2013.84 --> 2016.8799999999999
easily

2014.64 --> 2018.159
politicized that's what that sort of

2016.88 --> 2020.5590000000002
stupidity is

2018.159 --> 2022.64
it's not oh yeah we're going to just say

2020.559 --> 2024.559
that on the globe you can literally see

2022.64 --> 2028.48
from one side to the other

2024.559 --> 2031.6789999999999
they never ever say that they will never

2028.48 --> 2032.799
ever say that i don't know why you think

2031.679 --> 2037.039
that's a joke

2032.799 --> 2038.0
serious sorry for getting bit hard on

2037.039 --> 2047.84
your ass but

2038.0 --> 2047.84
this is just stupid

2057.599 --> 2060.96
the real problem is cognitive i don't

2059.76 --> 2064.8
know

2060.96 --> 2068.079
it's conditioning is that cognitive

2064.8 --> 2071.2000000000003
maybe but yes

2068.079 --> 2074.7200000000003
certain type of details teachings get

2071.2 --> 2077.359
real eroded in your thinking pattern

2074.72 --> 2080.0
and then you constantly fall back to

2077.359 --> 2080.0
them because

2080.159 --> 2084.7200000000003
you can't let you can't let go that it

2082.879 --> 2086.639
might have been completely wrong

2084.72 --> 2089.2799999999997
so that's what keeping a lot of people

2086.639 --> 2092.7200000000003
into that cognitive dissonance state

2089.28 --> 2092.7200000000003
cargo apple that's a good point

2096.879 --> 2100.16
i don't know anyone who thinks we live

2099.04 --> 2102.48
on a disk

2100.16 --> 2104.3199999999997
okay well there's plenty of flat

2102.48 --> 2107.44
earthers out there that

2104.32 --> 2109.61
still just assume it's a disk based on

2107.44 --> 2111.2000000000003
the map

2109.61 --> 2114.839
[Music]

2111.2 --> 2116.0
and um how easy a disk would make it to

2114.839 --> 2119.2
basically

2116.0 --> 2120.96
triangulate that the sun and the moon

2119.2 --> 2123.0789999999997
are literally in a circle

2120.96 --> 2127.04
over that disc right so there's

2123.079 --> 2127.04
conveniences that come with it

2127.839 --> 2132.32
it's presuppositionally more convenient

2130.4 --> 2134.2400000000002
for flat earthers to think it's a disk

2132.32 --> 2134.56
and that's why a lot of them per default

2134.24 --> 2137.1189999999997
think

2134.56 --> 2137.119
it's a disk

2140.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
doesn't mean it is a disk

2156.4 --> 2163.6800000000003
stallion 80 12 moments of foolishness

2160.96 --> 2165.599
which moments of foolishness is that you

2163.68 --> 2167.44
tell me style in 80 12. you got an

2165.599 --> 2169.52
example

2167.44 --> 2172.8
hey nathan oakley 9080 by the way good

2169.52 --> 2176.96
to see you

2172.8 --> 2181.119
you like the rub schema model yeah

2176.96 --> 2181.119
well it's not bad

2181.599 --> 2187.76
it is a more complete model

2184.88 --> 2201.839
but it is absolutely disk based and it

2187.76 --> 2201.8390000000004
doesn't address a whole bunch of things

2206.88 --> 2211.119
right but look with when it comes to

2210.0 --> 2213.359
flat earth models

2211.119 --> 2215.839
discs are the only way you can actually

2213.359 --> 2217.7599999999998
present a closed system

2215.839 --> 2219.04
when you try to build it that's the only

2217.76 --> 2221.2000000000003
way you can

2219.04 --> 2222.88
make a flat earth model that is closed

2221.2 --> 2225.2
because how are you going to represent a

2222.88 --> 2227.04
rectangular looping system

2225.2 --> 2228.96
it's very simple it's going to be open

2227.04 --> 2231.2799999999997
on two sides because those sides are

2228.96 --> 2234.4
interconnected oh wait you can't

2231.28 --> 2235.92
physically build that yeah you can never

2234.4 --> 2239.359
physically build that

2235.92 --> 2242.8
so it's always going to be

2239.359 --> 2244.72
yeah an open system in a rectangular

2242.8 --> 2246.1600000000003
looping model

2244.72 --> 2248.56
and there's nothing really you can do

2246.16 --> 2248.56
about it

2250.8 --> 2258.079
that's why it's much easier to just take

2254.64 --> 2260.3199999999997
a disk based model

2258.079 --> 2261.28
instead because you can make that into a

2260.32 --> 2271.839
closed system

2261.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
with it with a dome over it

2275.52 --> 2287.359
undefined edges what

2284.64 --> 2288.0
what's the current widely accepted flat

2287.359 --> 2299.839
earth

2288.0 --> 2299.839
what what do you mean

2302.8 --> 2307.04
i don't know pat fee i don't know if

2306.16 --> 2310.24
people

2307.04 --> 2313.04
that are onto flat earth actually accept

2310.24 --> 2316.16
the model

2313.04 --> 2319.2
or if they even realize like the

2316.16 --> 2321.5989999999997
implications of it all

2319.2 --> 2322.96
so yeah i think that probably most flat

2321.599 --> 2326.079
earthers start out with the

2322.96 --> 2326.56
with the disc domed model that is the

2326.079 --> 2329.2000000000003
domed

2326.56 --> 2329.2
disk model

2337.76 --> 2344.7200000000003
okay that's silly stallion 8012

2341.2 --> 2348.16
the moon is not a physical object

2344.72 --> 2348.16
it did not come from earth

2348.64 --> 2360.0
like it did not come from physical earth

2354.24 --> 2360.0
the material earth it's light based

2362.48 --> 2365.839
it might have once been a sun in its own

2365.44 --> 2369.839
right

2365.839 --> 2369.839
it's not anymore it's a moon now

2386.8 --> 2390.2400000000002
what's your thoughts on the sun being a

2388.48 --> 2393.28
portal well

2390.24 --> 2396.3199999999997
no just no

2393.28 --> 2398.1600000000003
there is no portals understand in a

2396.32 --> 2411.839
rectangular looping system

2398.16 --> 2411.839
there is no portals

2412.0 --> 2416.4
okay stella in 80 12 well flat earth

2414.48 --> 2418.8
aussie jesus

2416.4 --> 2419.6800000000003
wants to tell fantastical stories

2418.8 --> 2422.88
mythological

2419.68 --> 2426.48
obviously mythology

2422.88 --> 2429.76
crafted stories about the ancient past

2426.48 --> 2432.2400000000002
then that's very cute but

2429.76 --> 2434.88
don't mind if i completely disregard

2432.24 --> 2437.68
that and not take it serious

2434.88 --> 2438.48
because oh oh really something created

2437.68 --> 2440.319
the moon

2438.48 --> 2441.92
as in a physical object so where's the

2440.319 --> 2442.88
proof it's a physical object oh you

2441.92 --> 2444.88
don't have any

2442.88 --> 2446.359
well then i'm just going to completely

2444.88 --> 2449.599
throw out any

2446.359 --> 2452.0789999999997
fabrication of the moon story

2449.599 --> 2454.0
into the bin because it's completely

2452.079 --> 2456.0
useless there's no proof it's physical

2454.0 --> 2456.64
why would we assume it was physically

2456.0 --> 2467.839
built

2456.64 --> 2467.839
in any sort of way ever it's a light

2468.88 --> 2473.92
there is fe literature well that's

2471.28 --> 2473.92
[ __ ]

2474.56 --> 2478.64
that's just [ __ ] i don't care who

2478.0 --> 2481.359
wrote it

2478.64 --> 2483.04
look there might be hundreds of flat

2481.359 --> 2485.119
earthers out there writing all these

2483.04 --> 2487.2799999999997
books being all special by like oh

2485.119 --> 2489.28
dude i could think of something and oh i

2487.28 --> 2490.8
put it in a book oh i'm so smart

2489.28 --> 2493.2000000000003
for something alternative even though

2490.8 --> 2496.079
it's completely [ __ ]

2493.2 --> 2498.319
right who gives a [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ]

2496.079 --> 2499.52
what people write in a book if it makes

2498.319 --> 2509.7599999999998
no sense

2499.52 --> 2511.7599999999998
then who gives a [ __ ]

2509.76 --> 2523.8390000000004
book of enoch what about the book of

2511.76 --> 2523.8390000000004
enoch moth eyes

2531.599 --> 2538.4
what the moon is the r word what are you

2534.72 --> 2538.3999999999996
saying rest at i don't know what you're

2548.839 --> 2551.839
saying

2552.8 --> 2558.5600000000004
describes the sun in the moon origins

2556.16 --> 2558.56
really

2561.359 --> 2565.92
what about it how how does it describe

2564.16 --> 2568.7999999999997
that does it get all mythology

2565.92 --> 2568.8
mythological

2573.599 --> 2576.6400000000003
or is it describing the sightings of

2576.24 --> 2581.839
them

2576.64 --> 2581.839
and how they change due to big events

2582.8 --> 2586.7200000000003
god tinkering with the mechanism of the

2585.599 --> 2590.48
realm

2586.72 --> 2593.1189999999997
to alter it is that what that is about

2590.48 --> 2594.48
in the book of enoch otherwise it's just

2593.119 --> 2597.28
crap

2594.48 --> 2598.88
anything any description that's gonna

2597.28 --> 2601.6800000000003
tell you in some way

2598.88 --> 2602.48
i don't care even if it was literally in

2601.68 --> 2605.2
the bible

2602.48 --> 2606.64
in the new testament and it's not but if

2605.2 --> 2608.319
it was in there and said like oh yeah

2606.64 --> 2610.64
it's a physical thing it came

2608.319 --> 2611.599
it's [ __ ] lies because it's not i

2610.64 --> 2613.839
don't care

2611.599 --> 2615.6800000000003
who wrote it who said it where it is

2613.839 --> 2621.839
there's no evidence for it

2615.68 --> 2621.839
i don't care where it is it's wrong

2649.2 --> 2652.56
all right stallion 8012 thanks for

2651.119 --> 2655.52
coming by

2652.56 --> 2655.52
being part of the chat

2655.92 --> 2660.88
all right but yeah book of enoch it's

2658.64 --> 2662.64
really fascinating if there's a passage

2660.88 --> 2667.119
in there telling you

2662.64 --> 2667.1189999999997
physical origins of moon and sun

2667.599 --> 2672.319
i'd say yeah yeah it should absolutely

2670.64 --> 2677.2799999999997
be taken out of the canon

2672.319 --> 2680.88
because it's wrong wrong

2677.28 --> 2683.119
not physical never physical never was

2680.88 --> 2684.6400000000003
physical never will be physical it's

2683.119 --> 2691.839
light based and that's it

2684.64 --> 2691.839
and that's the only thing it ever is

2695.52 --> 2699.119
right well if you call yeah exactly tom

2697.839 --> 2700.96
parker if you call it

2699.119 --> 2703.44
lesser light yeah that's correct because

2700.96 --> 2704.16
it is light and that's what it is and

2703.44 --> 2707.68
that's what i

2704.16 --> 2711.44
really appreciated about

2707.68 --> 2712.8799999999997
genesis that it actually just sticks to

2711.44 --> 2715.599
those details

2712.88 --> 2716.56
and doesn't get all mythological about

2715.599 --> 2720.0
them

2716.56 --> 2733.2799999999997
because it's just light it's just light

2720.0 --> 2736.0
it's just light and that's all it is

2733.28 --> 2738.1600000000003
according to their names and place of

2736.0 --> 2740.48
what place of origin

2738.16 --> 2740.48
what

2742.0 --> 2747.2
celestial lights don't have a place of

2743.92 --> 2749.599
origin that's just weird

2747.2 --> 2750.96
they might have regions where they

2749.599 --> 2753.28
predominate

2750.96 --> 2756.8
because of the angular relations in

2753.28 --> 2759.599
relation to the geographical location

2756.8 --> 2759.599
but that's it

2759.839 --> 2764.56
that's it that's all there is to that

2765.76 --> 2772.079
and yes i know there's a whole bunch of

2768.96 --> 2774.96
basically astrological relation

2772.079 --> 2776.6400000000003
astrology relations with the celestials

2774.96 --> 2779.76
and you could

2776.64 --> 2782.16
translate that into a type of spirit or

2779.76 --> 2783.5200000000004
an essence or a frequency of things

2782.16 --> 2786.7999999999997
right and then get all

2783.52 --> 2789.2
ethereal or astrology like with that

2786.8 --> 2791.8390000000004
sure sure that probably works out you

2789.2 --> 2794.16
could probably do something with it and

2791.839 --> 2796.16
fine-tune yourself and all that as

2794.16 --> 2798.319
typical with astrology

2796.16 --> 2800.72
but as soon as any of it just says no

2798.319 --> 2803.359
it's actually physical it's coming

2800.72 --> 2805.04
it's a physical thing originating from a

2803.359 --> 2809.04
physical place i say oh

2805.04 --> 2811.119
right no [ __ ]

2809.04 --> 2812.4
call [ __ ] there's no proof of that

2811.119 --> 2814.56
whatsoever

2812.4 --> 2816.8
at all there's not even an indication of

2814.56 --> 2819.29
that it's just pure mytho

2816.8 --> 2820.5600000000004
mythologizing

2819.29 --> 2822.4
[Music]

2820.56 --> 2823.92
but the source of the light must come

2822.4 --> 2828.56
from somewhere right

2823.92 --> 2828.56
no what source of light

2829.44 --> 2835.2000000000003
what source of light what source are you

2833.28 --> 2837.52
talking about

2835.2 --> 2839.7599999999998
star in the jorge well that that's

2837.52 --> 2840.319
actually a provable local phenomena that

2839.76 --> 2842.3190000000004
you can

2840.319 --> 2844.8
apply perspective to approach it it

2842.319 --> 2847.92
becomes angular bigger and all that

2844.8 --> 2849.2000000000003
right yeah celestialites don't abide to

2847.92 --> 2851.52
that

2849.2 --> 2852.3999999999996
at all they're all holographic they're

2851.52 --> 2855.599
non-local

2852.4 --> 2858.64
they're just light manifest

2855.599 --> 2860.48
light arrives in a specific angular

2858.64 --> 2861.359
relation to the position on earth it

2860.48 --> 2865.119
arrives

2861.359 --> 2868.64
there's no origin point it just arrives

2865.119 --> 2870.319
it just manifests arrives up gets

2868.64 --> 2873.359
absorbed

2870.319 --> 2876.24
shows sites that's

2873.359 --> 2878.7999999999997
it there is no source it's not coming

2876.24 --> 2882.16
from a specific euclidean position

2878.8 --> 2882.1600000000003
in space at all

2882.559 --> 2888.48
it's non-local right now of course

2886.24 --> 2889.839
hey it's energy and energy has to come

2888.48 --> 2893.44
from somewhere

2889.839 --> 2895.92
so obviously something somehow

2893.44 --> 2898.0
is feeding into the energy that

2895.92 --> 2901.44
eventually causes

2898.0 --> 2904.319
daylight and sunlight to manifest and

2901.44 --> 2905.44
become absorbed here the energy has to

2904.319 --> 2908.4
come from somewhere so

2905.44 --> 2909.119
something is feeding into that light but

2908.4 --> 2912.48
it's not

2909.119 --> 2914.96
a source based feed

2912.48 --> 2917.68
it's not going through a specific

2914.96 --> 2917.68
location

2917.76 --> 2923.76
like an electrical mechanism

2921.119 --> 2925.119
i don't know how it feeds into the

2923.76 --> 2928.0
celestial lights

2925.119 --> 2929.2000000000003
i just know that since there is light

2928.0 --> 2931.359
and there is energy

2929.2 --> 2932.7999999999997
being absorbed at ground level it has to

2931.359 --> 2934.88
come from somewhere

2932.8 --> 2936.1600000000003
how does that work i don't know i just

2934.88 --> 2942.48
know it has to be

2936.16 --> 2944.7999999999997
somewhere feeding into it somehow

2942.48 --> 2946.88
solu luminescence yeah these are really

2944.8 --> 2950.2400000000002
nice but

2946.88 --> 2954.88
those are very fascinating little

2950.24 --> 2954.8799999999997
man made phenomena

2955.04 --> 2959.119
it it doesn't prove the sun or the

2958.079 --> 2962.319
celestial light

2959.119 --> 2965.04
none of it we have no clue

2962.319 --> 2965.68
we don't even come close to having a

2965.04 --> 2968.24
clue

2965.68 --> 2969.2
as to how the celestial lights are

2968.24 --> 2972.4799999999996
manifested

2969.2 --> 2975.68
we don't have a clue not a single clue

2972.48 --> 2977.2
nothing no study in the last in a couple

2975.68 --> 2980.5589999999997
of hundred years with the most

2977.2 --> 2983.4399999999996
genius people in the world nobody has

2980.559 --> 2984.079
ever figured out how it works and every

2983.44 --> 2986.079
time

2984.079 --> 2988.6400000000003
oh look at this special phenomena that

2986.079 --> 2991.28
we made oh could that be the sun oh my

2988.64 --> 2994.5589999999997
god we have to figure out what it is

2991.28 --> 2997.28
we have to know what it is uh

2994.559 --> 2998.1600000000003
yeah no you don't know get the [ __ ] over

2997.28 --> 3001.2000000000003
it you don't

2998.16 --> 3004.319
know every time you build something

3001.2 --> 3006.319
you do something on earth to try to

3004.319 --> 3008.319
explain how that could be

3006.319 --> 3010.8
up there the sun and the moon it makes

3008.319 --> 3013.2
no sense yeah good luck with that

3010.8 --> 3014.4
good luck with that it's all [ __ ]

3013.2 --> 3017.839
you don't

3014.4 --> 3020.96
know you don't know you probably

3017.839 --> 3023.04
never will know i don't even want

3020.96 --> 3025.599
at this point i don't even know if i

3023.04 --> 3027.92
wanna know

3025.599 --> 3028.96
because i'm just so [ __ ] embarrassed

3027.92 --> 3032.4
by all these

3028.96 --> 3034.96
people that think they're intellects

3032.4 --> 3036.7200000000003
that just constantly get propelled by

3034.96 --> 3040.559
their physicality assumption

3036.72 --> 3044.16
buys it we have to know what it is

3040.559 --> 3046.4
we have to know make a

3044.16 --> 3048.96
thing oh this is what the sun must be it

3046.4 --> 3050.559
must be because we have no ulterior

3048.96 --> 3052.48
explanation so

3050.559 --> 3054.0
we're just gonna reified into some

3052.48 --> 3055.28
stupid man-made device

3054.0 --> 3057.04
and now that means that all the

3055.28 --> 3059.599
celestial lights have to be like that

3057.04 --> 3063.359
man-made device because otherwise

3059.599 --> 3065.599
it might turn out that we don't know

3063.359 --> 3065.5989999999997
huh

3076.319 --> 3083.839
yeah gfb 45 you don't know either

3079.92 --> 3083.839
you have no clue

3084.72 --> 3089.52
eric dollar has some nice theories oh

3088.0 --> 3092.319
really like it is a

3089.52 --> 3094.72
physical plasma thing in a specific

3092.319 --> 3099.04
euclidean location

3094.72 --> 3103.4399999999996
like a lamp oh what else is new

3099.04 --> 3106.8
dude nobody out there

3103.44 --> 3109.28
nobody nobody besides myself

3106.8 --> 3110.319
that i've come across actually has some

3109.28 --> 3113.44
kind of model

3110.319 --> 3115.52
idea of what it is

3113.44 --> 3116.96
i just say yeah it's non-local it's

3115.52 --> 3120.24
holographic

3116.96 --> 3121.2
every celestial site is unique to the

3120.24 --> 3124.7999999999997
observer

3121.2 --> 3127.1189999999997
unique as in nobody else

3124.8 --> 3128.96
has the same celestial correlations

3127.119 --> 3132.559
because they're in a different position

3128.96 --> 3134.4
nobody it's 100 percent unique for every

3132.559 --> 3137.0400000000004
single observation

3134.4 --> 3139.2000000000003
because it's all holographic all of it

3137.04 --> 3139.68
none of it is actually based on some

3139.2 --> 3142.96
kind of

3139.68 --> 3146.24
physical thing in a euclidean position

3142.96 --> 3146.8
in the realm that causes it none of it

3146.24 --> 3149.68
is

3146.8 --> 3151.04
none of it it's all purely holographic

3149.68 --> 3154.64
purely

3151.04 --> 3157.68
nobody else seems to wants to

3154.64 --> 3158.72
touch on that right they don't want to

3157.68 --> 3161.04
talk about it no

3158.72 --> 3163.2
they rather just oh let's just make a

3161.04 --> 3163.839
man-made device thing and then say oh

3163.2 --> 3167.7599999999998
look this

3163.839 --> 3171.119
kind of looks like it could be a star

3167.76 --> 3173.44
or the sun or just make a glass

3171.119 --> 3174.48
dome and shine some stuff on it from the

3173.44 --> 3177.76
outside oh this

3174.48 --> 3181.04
could be it right oh this could be it no

3177.76 --> 3185.44
no it's not not even close nothing

3181.04 --> 3188.48
like it nothing who made the holy crap

3185.44 --> 3189.68
god made the hologram the creator is

3188.48 --> 3192.72
part of the design

3189.68 --> 3196.7999999999997
of the realm it's inherent you will

3192.72 --> 3200.72
never know how it works

3196.8 --> 3203.04
you will never know how it works

3200.72 --> 3203.839
i probably will never know how it works

3203.04 --> 3206.5589999999997
even though i've

3203.839 --> 3207.599
already speculated on how we could

3206.559 --> 3210.96
potentially

3207.599 --> 3212.1600000000003
eventually find out through my micro

3210.96 --> 3215.44
emulation

3212.16 --> 3216.24
right nobody out there is even talking

3215.44 --> 3219.52
about it

3216.24 --> 3222.3999999999996
they're all just busy oh let's just make

3219.52 --> 3224.559
some physical phenomena and all that

3222.4 --> 3226.319
must be what the celestial lights are

3224.559 --> 3230.0
like

3226.319 --> 3233.359
you're so special no no you're not

3230.0 --> 3236.96
you're reifying soon

3233.359 --> 3238.96
as you latch on to

3236.96 --> 3240.48
some idea that any of the celestial

3238.96 --> 3243.52
lights can be

3240.48 --> 3247.28
made physically

3243.52 --> 3250.16
from a physical point based system

3247.28 --> 3252.0
you're wrong instantly instantly

3250.16 --> 3255.1189999999997
discardable

3252.0 --> 3258.559
it's wrong it's non-local

3255.119 --> 3260.7200000000003
you can't figure out how it works by

3258.559 --> 3264.7200000000003
making something local

3260.72 --> 3278.24
you can't do that it's not how it works

3264.72 --> 3280.72
get over it

3278.24 --> 3282.72
bad fee who the [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ]

3280.72 --> 3293.839
what ranty thinks about what they are

3282.72 --> 3293.839
who gives a flying [ __ ] dude

3300.079 --> 3307.8390000000004
he believes in a freaking ball who gives

3302.0 --> 3307.839
a [ __ ] what he thinks about it

3316.0 --> 3319.52
sun moon stars earth all electric by

3318.96 --> 3324.0
nature

3319.52 --> 3327.04
no no they're not earth is physical

3324.0 --> 3330.799
sun moon stars not physical

3327.04 --> 3334.0
light right light

3330.799 --> 3336.559
physical light physical not the

3334.0 --> 3338.72
same oh there is electricity happening

3336.559 --> 3341.0400000000004
oh yeah electricity can feed into light

3338.72 --> 3344.64
electricity can go through

3341.04 --> 3347.44
matter yeah that's nice matter

3344.64 --> 3348.44
light matter light matter light

3347.44 --> 3352.4
different

3348.44 --> 3354.799
fundamentally different not the same

3352.4 --> 3356.48
get it through your head right does it

3354.799 --> 3359.92
matter if einstein once

3356.48 --> 3362.4
claimed that matter is is

3359.92 --> 3363.359
arrested light right this is a very nice

3362.4 --> 3366.96
science fiction

3363.359 --> 3368.64
theory it's absolutely ridiculous

3366.96 --> 3371.119
right if you're going to use that all

3368.64 --> 3373.96
like oh that means

3371.119 --> 3375.119
through special boy logic fantasy

3373.96 --> 3378.64
everything

3375.119 --> 3381.44
is the same everything is the same it's

3378.64 --> 3383.5989999999997
all one thing all energy so one thing

3381.44 --> 3386.64
matter and light it's all the same

3383.599 --> 3391.0
no it's not

3386.64 --> 3394.0
stop being [ __ ] stop applying your

3391.0 --> 3398.0
universalization hippie

3394.0 --> 3400.559
tricks let's make it all one it's not

3398.0 --> 3402.16
it's different why don't you freaking

3400.559 --> 3405.76
figure out it's different

3402.16 --> 3409.5989999999997
and then deal with it that it is

3405.76 --> 3418.3900000000003
different and not all the same

3409.599 --> 3421.55
get over it

3418.39 --> 3421.5499999999997
[Music]

3430.839 --> 3433.839
uh

3441.2 --> 3444.33
[Music]

3450.4 --> 3454.7200000000003
cool yeah i know jared sanford you can

3454.24 --> 3458.9599999999996
measure

3454.72 --> 3461.5989999999997
electric current that's nice

3458.96 --> 3463.04
so how can you measure electric current

3461.599 --> 3466.079
through holographic

3463.04 --> 3468.4
non-local phenomena you tell me how that

3466.079 --> 3468.4
works

3468.48 --> 3472.319
right where are you going to measure if

3470.0 --> 3475.68
you can't even within space

3472.319 --> 3477.2799999999997
pinpoint a specific location

3475.68 --> 3478.72
right how does that work how are you

3477.28 --> 3481.8390000000004
going to measure something when you

3478.72 --> 3481.839
don't have a location

3482.48 --> 3489.839
you tell me

3494.64 --> 3503.839
all right pet fee if you say so man

3505.96 --> 3509.09
[Music]

3544.4 --> 3549.119
let me get the title update for this

3549.33 --> 3553.489
[Music]

3556.839 --> 3559.839
show

3571.839 --> 3590.24
there you go

3587.52 --> 3592.0
he sounds a bit less angry now well

3590.24 --> 3594.4799999999996
probably because

3592.0 --> 3596.079
the nasty nasty piece of [ __ ] trolls

3594.48 --> 3598.96
that have been trying to work on him

3596.079 --> 3601.52
since he came onto the scene

3598.96 --> 3603.04
with some success have been able to

3601.52 --> 3605.68
manipulate him and when you

3603.04 --> 3606.079
bait those types of people when you take

3605.68 --> 3609.359
their

3606.079 --> 3610.4
things they only get worse and they know

3609.359 --> 3612.48
like we are

3610.4 --> 3614.88
as soon as you really give in to the

3612.48 --> 3616.2400000000002
real nasty behind the scene trolls that

3614.88 --> 3618.96
are manipulating you

3616.24 --> 3619.68
as soon as you give in to them once they

3618.96 --> 3622.88
will

3619.68 --> 3625.7599999999998
never ever let go again

3622.88 --> 3629.2000000000003
right so yeah he probably is a little

3625.76 --> 3631.2000000000003
bit relieved that now that he's sold out

3629.2 --> 3633.2799999999997
oh my god at least i don't get those

3631.2 --> 3633.7599999999998
[ __ ] up people after me anymore now

3633.28 --> 3636.96
they're

3633.76 --> 3638.7200000000003
my friends right so it's probably

3636.96 --> 3642.079
relieved

3638.72 --> 3643.9199999999996
of just the pressure going away

3642.079 --> 3646.96
that's not the end of it because he's

3643.92 --> 3646.96
totally stuck now

3648.72 --> 3652.799
where's he gonna go with this three

3650.48 --> 3653.44
thinking speculation now oh wait he

3652.799 --> 3656.799
can't

3653.44 --> 3660.2400000000002
no he has to abide by globe machinations

3656.799 --> 3660.24
i'll have fun with that ranty

3669.2 --> 3673.359
he's gonna be bored out of his mind and

3671.44 --> 3675.599
that's not gonna take a long time to get

3673.359 --> 3675.5989999999997
there

3676.24 --> 3684.319
the globe is really boring it's

3679.28 --> 3686.2400000000002
really freaking boring

3684.319 --> 3687.839
hello dutch sailor good to see you in

3686.24 --> 3691.839
chat

3687.839 --> 3691.839
the big m also in chat hello

3696.839 --> 3699.839
hmm

3705.23 --> 3708.3
[Music]

3752.839 --> 3755.839
right

3757.33 --> 3761.839
[Music]

3759.92 --> 3769.839
yeah here we go again well there's all

3761.839 --> 3769.839
kinds of things right

3771.359 --> 3776.96
missed the night oh hang out

3775.119 --> 3778.319
all right let's say there yeah it was

3776.96 --> 3780.0
very late so

3778.319 --> 3784.16
went up until like two o'clock or

3780.0 --> 3784.16
something did you watch it back

3787.599 --> 3797.839
went on for two hours and 45 minutes

3790.64 --> 3797.839
a pretty long hangout

3802.72 --> 3806.8799999999997
and to be fair like most of the time

3805.52 --> 3810.0
even

3806.88 --> 3812.559
i was just

3810.0 --> 3815.28
be fair i couldn't even properly focus

3812.559 --> 3818.3190000000004
on on all the arguments all of the time

3815.28 --> 3821.3590000000004
because it was kind of late for me

3818.319 --> 3823.68
and i've had it had a few beers

3821.359 --> 3825.2
before that time was kind of like it was

3823.68 --> 3827.44
dropping off slowly

3825.2 --> 3829.4399999999996
but i was just not super focused so most

3827.44 --> 3831.76
of the hangout i actually spent on the

3829.44 --> 3831.76
chat

3831.839 --> 3836.319
kind of moderating and just saying hello

3834.16 --> 3836.319
and

3837.76 --> 3843.44
looking around but i just let the guys

3842.0 --> 3845.92
do the talking and that when

3843.44 --> 3848.799
they they wouldn't stop this is it just

3845.92 --> 3850.88
that's why it was a two

3848.799 --> 3853.119
two hour 45 minute hangout because they

3850.88 --> 3854.88
really had a lot to share

3853.119 --> 3857.76
and they needed the room when i gave it

3854.88 --> 3861.119
to them and i'm really glad that i did

3857.76 --> 3861.119
thought it was very successful

3862.799 --> 3866.88
yeah i had great company in the panel

3864.48 --> 3870.2400000000002
adam meekin legend

3866.88 --> 3871.039
brian also turning out to be quite a

3870.24 --> 3873.839
legend

3871.039 --> 3873.8390000000004
in his own right

3874.319 --> 3876.5589999999997
uh

3877.76 --> 3882.2400000000002
missed flat sword though he missed it

3880.079 --> 3885.2000000000003
too like he could have been there but

3882.24 --> 3886.24
yeah he missed out on it uh what else

3885.2 --> 3890.0789999999997
was in there uh

3886.24 --> 3892.839
neil just hanging

3890.079 --> 3895.8390000000004
with the samba music in the background

3892.839 --> 3895.839
uh

3896.4 --> 3899.2000000000003
what's this there

3900.24 --> 3908.0
oh yeah tony of course sleeping warrior

3903.92 --> 3910.48
yeah it was fun i glad i could host

3908.0 --> 3910.48
that show

3914.4 --> 3920.839
apart from light the sun image radio and

3917.44 --> 3925.2000000000003
x-ray waves oh really oh really

3920.839 --> 3928.799
so right we all know how you can trace

3925.2 --> 3932.3999999999996
light back to its origin right raziel

3928.799 --> 3934.079
how about x-rays radio

3932.4 --> 3936.079
how about you try to do the same thing

3934.079 --> 3939.119
with that

3936.079 --> 3941.76
i bet you the same thing is gonna happen

3939.119 --> 3943.92
as does with the light it's gonna be

3941.76 --> 3947.44
non-origin point based you're never

3943.92 --> 3949.039
gonna find the origin point for it ever

3947.44 --> 3950.96
right how are you gonna trace those

3949.039 --> 3954.0
signals back to the origin

3950.96 --> 3957.119
moving into the sky towards it

3954.0 --> 3959.68
on the exact angle of approach that it

3957.119 --> 3961.359
where it came from right i'm pretty sure

3959.68 --> 3965.52
that when you do that

3961.359 --> 3967.119
it's gonna bend away the closer you get

3965.52 --> 3969.52
and then it's going to be like a dragon

3967.119 --> 3973.119
you're going to be chasing forever

3969.52 --> 3974.4
right just as much with the radio and

3973.119 --> 3979.839
x-rays

3974.4 --> 3979.839
as with the light

3981.599 --> 3984.319
non-local

3986.96 --> 3995.44
so yeah in that sense i could argue that

3991.68 --> 3997.9199999999996
presumed radio and x-rays coming off

3995.44 --> 4000.079
the presumed sun are just as much

3997.92 --> 4003.599
holographic as all the celestial lights

4000.079 --> 4003.599
yeah that that's weird isn't it

4003.68 --> 4007.359
now unless you can actually prove

4005.28 --> 4007.92
they're coming from a specific origin

4007.359 --> 4011.5989999999997
point

4007.92 --> 4014.079
in the realm somewhere yeah that's going

4011.599 --> 4016.2400000000002
to be the way i'm going to approach that

4014.079 --> 4017.44
anything coming from the presumed sun is

4016.24 --> 4020.24
all

4017.44 --> 4024.16
elusive it's all non-local so

4020.24 --> 4024.16
holographic is the only alternative

4029.2 --> 4035.839
all right

4074.839 --> 4077.839
hmm

4107.839 --> 4119.839
what pat b what are you talking about

4130.839 --> 4133.839
so

4135.279 --> 4147.839000000001
ah hey tony whitcomb yeah glad you

4138.0 --> 4147.839
appreciate it

4157.04 --> 4164.159
some way to detect radio is what

4160.64 --> 4175.839
uh look pineapple

4164.159 --> 4175.839
there is what what are you talking about

4183.92 --> 4190.4
debate what 5212 is and brian replied 30

4187.679 --> 4195.04
what i don't know what that means

4190.4 --> 4195.04
i don't know what that that's what

4195.52 --> 4201.84
what i'm

4198.56 --> 4204.56
a little confused here bad fee what are

4201.84 --> 4204.56
you talking about

4209.52 --> 4231.84
oh hey thank you tony whitcomb for

4213.679 --> 4231.84
becoming a member a seer no less awesome

4234.0 --> 4236.56
oh okay

4237.44 --> 4243.44
so you mean to say he asked the basic

4241.199 --> 4246.0
very basic calculation question i

4243.44 --> 4247.36
thought it was referencing something

4246.0 --> 4249.76
else

4247.36 --> 4249.759999999999
all right

4254.4 --> 4259.839999999999
i don't know what that has to do with

4256.56 --> 4259.84
ryan being a legend though

4271.92 --> 4277.36
right he probably didn't hear the fifth

4273.92 --> 4277.36
the two in the 52.

4283.76 --> 4288.88
yeah i get it i get it i see it now he

4286.56 --> 4291.360000000001
probably just heard 50

4288.88 --> 4292.0
right unless somebody showed it

4291.36 --> 4293.839999999999
literally

4292.0 --> 4296.0
in text right in front of his nose and

4293.84 --> 4298.84
he would say 38

4296.0 --> 4300.32
right if it's just verbal it's very

4298.84 --> 4305.04
likely

4300.32 --> 4315.84
he heard 50 and not 52

4305.04 --> 4315.84
don't you think so

4323.84 --> 4327.52
he didn't hear it twice well yeah could

4325.6 --> 4330.719
be

4327.52 --> 4331.52
dude like you try and go for three hours

4330.719 --> 4334.32
with somebody

4331.52 --> 4337.92
constantly avoiding questions and trying

4334.32 --> 4339.92
to derail your trainer thinking

4337.92 --> 4341.12
and then at some point somebody asked

4339.92 --> 4342.64
something like that

4341.12 --> 4345.76
it's very likely you're gonna be

4342.64 --> 4348.8
slightly distracted

4345.76 --> 4349.4400000000005
it could be really dumb oh or you could

4348.8 --> 4357.84
be

4349.44 --> 4357.839999999999
really banned

4386.0 --> 4392.239
uh the big m i don't know what any of

4389.6 --> 4392.2390000000005
that means

4392.4 --> 4399.839999999999
i don't know what you're into but it's

4394.56 --> 4399.84
pretty disgusting

4424.56 --> 4429.280000000001
all right yeah brian is honest and he's

4427.12 --> 4431.199
really sharp yes he is

4429.28 --> 4432.48
yeah really really you want to get

4431.199 --> 4434.5599999999995
banned too

4432.48 --> 4435.678999999999
like i've known brian for quite a while

4434.56 --> 4438.96
now had

4435.679 --> 4442.08
long talks with him after the after show

4438.96 --> 4445.199
yeah he is very sharp

4442.08 --> 4448.159
it's just that if you get caught up

4445.199 --> 4449.12
in like in basically psychological

4448.159 --> 4450.96
defense mode

4449.12 --> 4454.159
because somebody's constantly trying to

4450.96 --> 4457.36
derail you red herring you at home you

4454.159 --> 4460.639999999999
you might like things you hear

4457.36 --> 4461.679
may slip you slip past you right it's

4460.64 --> 4465.52
like

4461.679 --> 4468.56
a listening mistake because your mind

4465.52 --> 4469.360000000001
is not fully focused on literally what

4468.56 --> 4472.64
you're hearing

4469.36 --> 4475.12
in that moment like you're

4472.64 --> 4477.280000000001
playing like a game specifically about

4475.12 --> 4478.239
what are you hearing right no he's still

4477.28 --> 4480.5599999999995
focused

4478.239 --> 4481.839999999999
on the whole setup on the trickery

4480.56 --> 4484.400000000001
that's engaging

4481.84 --> 4485.84
that distracts you right so then if

4484.4 --> 4489.199
somebody says 52

4485.84 --> 4491.76
you might just hear 50

4489.199 --> 4492.48
right especially if 12 is mentioned

4491.76 --> 4495.280000000001
after that

4492.48 --> 4495.759999999999
that's just like a hearing mistake

4495.28 --> 4498.159
that's an

4495.76 --> 4499.12
input mistake that's not a calculus

4498.159 --> 4502.239
mistake he's not

4499.12 --> 4504.64
an idiot he absolutely knows calculus he

4502.239 --> 4507.04
knows it better than i do

4504.64 --> 4509.280000000001
but if you're right caught up in

4507.04 --> 4512.159
something complex

4509.28 --> 4514.159
involving psychological warfare defense

4512.159 --> 4517.04
yeah you might mishear those things

4514.159 --> 4518.96
that's like a mechanism

4517.04 --> 4520.88
because you don't have full focus that

4518.96 --> 4522.719
happens that very typically happens and

4520.88 --> 4526.96
i think that

4522.719 --> 4529.12
brian will under high pressure

4526.96 --> 4530.2390000000005
make those types of technical mistakes

4529.12 --> 4532.719
because it's too

4530.239 --> 4535.04
focused on puzzling things out in his

4532.719 --> 4537.36
mind that he just might mishear

4535.04 --> 4539.199
things out there that's normal that's

4537.36 --> 4541.28
normal especially for somebody that's

4539.199 --> 4543.678999999999
really good at calculus

4541.28 --> 4546.96
might not have noticed but rhompus does

4543.679 --> 4548.96
make those types of mistakes too

4546.96 --> 4551.04
when you put him under pressure it

4548.96 --> 4567.84
typically happened

4551.04 --> 4567.84
that typically happens

4572.719 --> 4579.199
right yeah here we go again look as soon

4576.32 --> 4580.159
as you don't hear somebody sentence in

4579.199 --> 4582.799999999999
the middle of a

4580.159 --> 4584.08
psychological warfare for three hours as

4582.8 --> 4588.08
soon as you

4584.08 --> 4590.239
mishear somebody and then give a

4588.08 --> 4591.44
response that's based on not hearing

4590.239 --> 4593.44
them properly

4591.44 --> 4595.04
that means you're stupid of course

4593.44 --> 4596.4
that's that's the desperation the

4595.04 --> 4598.64
ballers have

4596.4 --> 4598.639999999999
right

4603.28 --> 4609.36
of course like of course if you put

4607.36 --> 4611.599999999999
somebody in highly stressful

4609.36 --> 4613.199
unreasonable circumstances they're gonna

4611.6 --> 4616.8
make basic mistakes

4613.199 --> 4618.159
that's normal right it's already

4616.8 --> 4620.0
impressive that they can keep their

4618.159 --> 4622.159
composure for so long

4620.0 --> 4623.199
under such pressure but you're gonna

4622.159 --> 4626.719
make mistakes

4623.199 --> 4628.96
that's natural but for a bowler

4626.719 --> 4630.2390000000005
doesn't matter what types of conditions

4628.96 --> 4632.56
you're in

4630.239 --> 4633.599999999999
if you make a mistake ever that means

4632.56 --> 4637.360000000001
that you can be

4633.6 --> 4639.76
completely thrown down a well

4637.36 --> 4641.12
then you're stupid right even though

4639.76 --> 4643.76
they [ __ ] do it

4641.12 --> 4645.76
all the time themselves even when not

4643.76 --> 4650.159000000001
put under pressure

4645.76 --> 4652.56
yeah so it's just pure projection

4650.159 --> 4653.36
this ballers don't want to like brian

4652.56 --> 4656.0
because he's

4653.36 --> 4658.719
smarter than them and they don't want to

4656.0 --> 4658.719
know about it

4660.0 --> 4663.679
they were supposed to be smarter because

4662.48 --> 4664.959999999999
they believed the ball

4663.679 --> 4667.76
that's what they were told that's how

4664.96 --> 4669.6
they grew up no you have to believe the

4667.76 --> 4671.679
ball because otherwise you're stupid

4669.6 --> 4672.96
but what about this person out there

4671.679 --> 4676.4
that's really

4672.96 --> 4679.6
smart technically

4676.4 --> 4680.08
as a great oversight but he's not a

4679.6 --> 4683.280000000001
baller

4680.08 --> 4685.6
well then you have to find dig through

4683.28 --> 4687.92
everything he's done to find a little

4685.6 --> 4689.92
technical mistake

4687.92 --> 4691.04
so you can feel better about yourself

4689.92 --> 4694.96
before you

4691.04 --> 4694.96
get bad piece of [ __ ]

4702.88 --> 4707.84
yeah see you later moth ice thanks for

4705.12 --> 4707.84
popping by

4730.68 --> 4735.84
[Music]

4732.84 --> 4735.84
um

4737.05 --> 4741.579000000001
[Music]

4742.48 --> 4745.919999999999
all right like yeah here we go i

4744.64 --> 4748.8
wouldn't even call it

4745.92 --> 4750.96
i don't like the word sad i would call

4748.8 --> 4754.2390000000005
it desperate

4750.96 --> 4754.2390000000005
call it deluded

4755.28 --> 4763.84
not sad i'm not

4758.48 --> 4763.839999999999
like no that's not a set they deserve it

4764.88 --> 4768.88
when something is said then everybody

4767.12 --> 4771.679
else that's gonna see it is gonna feel

4768.88 --> 4775.1990000000005
sad no but i don't feel sad for them

4771.679 --> 4778.2390000000005
they deserve it because they're stupid

4775.199 --> 4778.239
and they're arrogant

4779.44 --> 4783.919999999999
like the dumbest thing you can do in

4782.56 --> 4787.120000000001
life

4783.92 --> 4789.92
is basically hold on to a false

4787.12 --> 4790.719
image that you're smart that's the

4789.92 --> 4793.12
dumbest

4790.719 --> 4793.84
thing you could possibly do because that

4793.12 --> 4797.12
way you

4793.84 --> 4798.88
ensure that you don't smarten up

4797.12 --> 4800.8
it's the dumbest thing you can do it

4798.88 --> 4802.64
doesn't matter like what your cognitive

4800.8 --> 4807.1990000000005
capabilities are

4802.64 --> 4810.320000000001
if you hold on to stupid

4807.199 --> 4812.638999999999
that's the real stupid

4810.32 --> 4814.4
when you should know better when you can

4812.639 --> 4816.56
figure it out

4814.4 --> 4819.28
if you just let it go if you let go of

4816.56 --> 4820.320000000001
the feelings that prevent you from going

4819.28 --> 4822.0
there

4820.32 --> 4823.92
that's the real stupid doesn't really

4822.0 --> 4824.719
matter where you are cognitively how

4823.92 --> 4828.96
quick you are

4824.719 --> 4828.96
how technically smart you are

4829.199 --> 4833.599999999999
the smartest person can be unbelievably

4832.0 --> 4836.08
stupid

4833.6 --> 4836.719
if they allow their feelings to prevent

4836.08 --> 4840.0
them from

4836.719 --> 4843.84
figuring things out and that's

4840.0 --> 4843.84
exactly where the ballers are at on

4844.84 --> 4847.84
average

4866.88 --> 4873.1990000000005
what are you talking about uh zeo

4870.8 --> 4874.08
eight does it even freaking matter it's

4873.199 --> 4877.919999999999
it's

4874.08 --> 4881.28
just six meters it's six meters high

4877.92 --> 4884.2390000000005
it's a black swan doesn't matter if it's

4881.28 --> 4886.84
12 miles away or eight miles away it's a

4884.239 --> 4888.239
black swan the whole thing is a black

4886.84 --> 4891.28
swan

4888.239 --> 4892.32
it's even more of a black swan than the

4891.28 --> 4895.04
oil rig

4892.32 --> 4896.159
photographs which are taken from live

4895.04 --> 4898.88
footage

4896.159 --> 4900.96
yeah it's a black swan it doesn't matter

4898.88 --> 4903.04
how far away it is it's a black swan

4900.96 --> 4906.8
it's flat

4903.04 --> 4912.56
the blackpool tower is a black

4906.8 --> 4915.12
pool swan it's proof the earth is flat

4912.56 --> 4917.120000000001
fidging the numbers and closer further

4915.12 --> 4921.12
it doesn't matter it's a black swan

4917.12 --> 4924.32
it's flat it's proof the earth is flat

4921.12 --> 4925.04
get it doesn't matter how close how far

4924.32 --> 4929.44
away it is

4925.04 --> 4929.44
it's flat the whole thing is flat

4929.6 --> 4933.04
no it doesn't make a huge difference in

4932.159 --> 4935.12
this case

4933.04 --> 4945.84
doesn't make any difference it's flat

4935.12 --> 4945.84
the whole thing is flat

4951.6 --> 4956.84
hmm okay dutch sailor installing a new

4955.199 --> 4959.839999999999
monitor

4956.84 --> 4959.84
cool

4972.239 --> 4980.5599999999995
hmm well i'd love to have one myself

4976.96 --> 4983.44
but yeah i can afford such things

4980.56 --> 4985.679
and i'm still doing great with my 2006

4983.44 --> 5001.839999999999
monitor

4985.679 --> 5001.84
it's holding up fantastically

5022.32 --> 5029.84
it's one third of a distance closer than

5025.6 --> 5029.84
henry what are you talking about

5030.32 --> 5033.5199999999995
the whole thing is flat just look at the

5032.639 --> 5036.639
left side

5033.52 --> 5038.0
it's flat the whole thing is flat it's

5036.639 --> 5041.679
flat

5038.0 --> 5046.0
who cares where that tower seems to be

5041.679 --> 5048.88
it's flat the whole thing is flat

5046.0 --> 5050.639
it's a black swan it's flat the whole

5048.88 --> 5052.32
thing is flat doesn't really matter like

5050.639 --> 5053.84
what's happening to the tower in

5052.32 --> 5057.36
relation to the mountain

5053.84 --> 5061.12
it's flat the whole thing

5057.36 --> 5063.5199999999995
is flat whatever's sticking out

5061.12 --> 5064.88
just take a look to the left the whole

5063.52 --> 5068.0
thing is flat

5064.88 --> 5070.96
there's no earth curve bulge

5068.0 --> 5073.04
obstructing view in the distance not the

5070.96 --> 5076.8
bottom of the mountain

5073.04 --> 5078.96
not anything should be there though

5076.8 --> 5081.6
especially due to the observation height

5078.96 --> 5084.639
being only six meters yeah that bulge

5081.6 --> 5086.8
should be there the the part of the sea

5084.639 --> 5088.56
should literally be blocking things into

5086.8 --> 5090.400000000001
the distance it isn't though

5088.56 --> 5092.639
you can see the bottom of the mountain

5090.4 --> 5099.839999999999
right on the other side

5092.639 --> 5099.84
because it's flat

5146.639 --> 5148.88
hmm

5153.28 --> 5155.84
right

5156.96 --> 5160.32
oh the difference the tower difference

5159.44 --> 5162.879999999999
it's different

5160.32 --> 5164.239
yeah but at the same time there is no

5162.88 --> 5167.12
oceanic bulge

5164.239 --> 5169.44
blocking the bottom of the mountain on

5167.12 --> 5171.199
the left side of the picture

5169.44 --> 5173.5199999999995
because it's flat and there's no

5171.199 --> 5176.48
curvature that obstructs

5173.52 --> 5176.96
things into the distance in accordance

5176.48 --> 5180.718999999999
to the

5176.96 --> 5184.159
globe geometry right doesn't matter

5180.719 --> 5185.6
who distance difference tower here there

5184.159 --> 5188.638999999999
that's all very cute

5185.6 --> 5191.84
it's flat just take a look at the

5188.639 --> 5194.56
left of the picture it's flat flat

5191.84 --> 5195.1990000000005
there's no bulge blocking things in the

5194.56 --> 5197.84
distance

5195.199 --> 5197.839999999999
it's flat

this is this your life is this

5239.6 --> 5245.76
what you do desperately trying to

5243.199 --> 5246.5599999999995
hold on to that that picture somehow is

5245.76 --> 5250.88
a ball proof

5246.56 --> 5253.76
even it blatantly blatantly obviously

5250.88 --> 5255.28
isn't proof of a ball it's proof it's

5253.76 --> 5260.2390000000005
flat it's a black swan

5255.28 --> 5263.04
you're really gonna go around chats

5260.239 --> 5264.879999999999
and do that [ __ ] to reinforce the

cognitive dissonance on yourself and

5264.88 --> 5268.96
others

5268.96 --> 5273.04
swan photograph

5270.08 --> 5274.5599999999995
it proves the earth is flat and not a

5273.04 --> 5276.56
ball

5274.56 --> 5280.2390000000005
but still you're gonna go hang on to

the whole range of it it's all there

5384.239 --> 5387.839999999999
it's not

5384.8 --> 5389.28
missing on the left no it was supposedly

5387.84 --> 5391.12
missing on the right

5389.28 --> 5392.32
but then you look to the left there it

5391.12 --> 5395.76
is

it's a

black swan photograph as soon as you get

you're [ __ ]

flat

5869.76 --> 5875.360000000001
by revealing there's not a geometric

spherical bulge obstructing the side

5875.36 --> 5878.799999999999
into the distance

5876.719 --> 5880.96
very close by because the lower the

observation height the closer by this

5880.96 --> 5885.04
bulge this geometric bulge

5883.199 --> 5886.4
is going to obstruct things into the

yeah guess what low observation height 6

5890.48 --> 5894.0
no obstruction of things into the

6152.56 --> 6157.360000000001
like i don't care i don't care if you

6155.199 --> 6160.4
want whatever the [ __ ] you want to do to

6157.36 --> 6162.96
yourself ranty i don't care

6160.4 --> 6164.96
i literally don't care what it is how

6162.96 --> 6167.04
terrible it is

6164.96 --> 6168.4
just [ __ ] get over with it already

6167.04 --> 6170.48
and get out of my way

6168.4 --> 6172.96
because you're not worth my time you're

6170.48 --> 6176.0
a scumbag

6172.96 --> 6177.6
absolute piece of filth scumbag is what

6176.0 --> 6191.84
you are

6177.6 --> 6191.84
a traitor and a liar

6198.08 --> 6205.84
all right

6219.679 --> 6225.36
i don't know man i i reggio i don't know

6223.28 --> 6226.48
i don't know who's done simulations

6225.36 --> 6230.08
who's done what i

6226.48 --> 6232.638999999999
don't care i don't care anymore about

6230.08 --> 6236.0
this stupid observation [ __ ]

6232.639 --> 6239.4400000000005
like i don't care anymore right

6236.0 --> 6240.239
it's flat i know it's flat when it comes

6239.44 --> 6242.48
down to it

6240.239 --> 6244.4
any black swan observation as soon as

6242.48 --> 6246.08
you shove that in people's face either

6244.4 --> 6248.4
they just structurally deny

6246.08 --> 6251.119
every natural consequence and the

6248.4 --> 6251.119
geometry

6251.28 --> 6258.88
or they just start gaslighting you just

6255.679 --> 6260.88
i don't care it's flat it's all flat

6258.88 --> 6262.2390000000005
there is no more observations that are

6260.88 --> 6266.08
going to prove the contrary

6262.239 --> 6269.199
ever ever right and in debates people

6266.08 --> 6270.08
now even disclaim geometric horizons and

6269.199 --> 6273.44
all that

6270.08 --> 6276.4
it's a waste of my time

6273.44 --> 6277.759999999999
why would i get involved with stupid

6276.4 --> 6280.96
baller retards

6277.76 --> 6284.08
staring at pictures discussing whether

6280.96 --> 6286.639
it proves a ball or flat it's all flat

6284.08 --> 6289.679
there is no pictures that prove the ball

6286.639 --> 6292.56
they don't exist

6289.679 --> 6294.639
not any earth-based pictures right cgi

6292.56 --> 6298.080000000001
sure

6294.639 --> 6298.4800000000005
here on earth nope it's all flat i don't

6298.08 --> 6302.639
care

6298.48 --> 6304.879999999999
anymore i just don't care

6302.639 --> 6317.84
i don't care to go at it with these

6304.88 --> 6317.84
disgusting idiots

6326.159 --> 6331.839999999999
anyway i'm rounding out the show

6338.96 --> 6345.36
didn't quite end as i thought it would

6342.0 --> 6345.92
kind of annoying if you ask me it's just

6345.36 --> 6349.92
all this

6345.92 --> 6352.4800000000005
whining from ranty and ugh just stupid

6349.92 --> 6353.4400000000005
whining about that picture that's

6352.48 --> 6356.48
obviously

6353.44 --> 6358.799999999999
flat it's flat all of it nobody claims

6356.48 --> 6361.199
the geometric horizon anymore

6358.8 --> 6362.56
the ranty is just outdated with this

6361.199 --> 6364.159
stupid approach

6362.56 --> 6366.2390000000005
because nobody claims the geometric

6364.159 --> 6367.199
horizon it's supposed to be

6366.239 --> 6369.599999999999
terrestrially

6367.199 --> 6371.28
refracted in order to make it look flat

6369.6 --> 6373.52
no it's not even addressing that

6371.28 --> 6374.639
so it's just using outdated arguments

6373.52 --> 6378.080000000001
and a lot of

6374.639 --> 6381.04
really dumb dumb [ __ ]

6378.08 --> 6382.5599999999995
clinically [ __ ] late held back

6381.04 --> 6385.119
people

6382.56 --> 6386.719
are on him with it because they think oh

6385.119 --> 6388.4
somebody's defending the ball

6386.719 --> 6389.92
just like the old days because you don't

6388.4 --> 6392.96
remember any arguments you don't

6389.92 --> 6396.159
remember any consequences of anything

6392.96 --> 6399.199
she's just just stupid

6396.159 --> 6403.36
ballers are stupid really [ __ ]

6399.199 --> 6403.36
stupid and i'm done with this [ __ ]

6406.56 --> 6412.719
right whatever so thanks everyone for

6409.76 --> 6414.8
coming i hope you like this show

6412.719 --> 6416.0
if you did certainly thought that the

6414.8 --> 6417.84
first part was

6416.0 --> 6420.639
interesting going through celestial

6417.84 --> 6423.52
lights much more amusing than just

6420.639 --> 6423.92
whining ballers about stupid pictures

6423.52 --> 6425.84
that

6423.92 --> 6428.159
supposed to prove the ball even though

6425.84 --> 6432.400000000001
nobody claims the horizon is geometric

6428.159 --> 6432.4
blah blah blah blah etc etc

6435.76 --> 6443.679
what yo kyper what make it quick i'm

6439.6 --> 6446.88

6471.6 --> 6475.92
came in earlier who was it i don't this

6473.6 --> 6479.1990000000005
it's too far back in chat

6475.92 --> 6483.119
but thank you for becoming a member

6479.199 --> 6486.879999999999
and thanks for all the

6483.119 --> 6490.0
support in general yeah you guys

6486.88 --> 6491.92
stop asking ranty questions in my chat

6490.0 --> 6493.84
because he's banned in my chat that's

6491.92 --> 6498.639
kind of yeah

6493.84 --> 6501.28
it's no use he's not in my chat

6498.639 --> 6503.04
he's banned it's no use asking questions

6501.28 --> 6504.159
to somebody who's banned in chat that's

6503.04 --> 6506.719
just

6504.159 --> 6508.5599999999995
that kind of feels like backstabbing

6506.719 --> 6512.719
don't do that

6508.56 --> 6516.88
uh right i will be back tomorrow with

6512.719 --> 6518.639
flat earth early bird number 883

6516.88 --> 6521.119
a tuesday and i'm gonna join the flat

6518.639 --> 6527.84
earth debates which should start up any

6521.119 --> 6527.839999999999
second now

6533.28 --> 6536.639
okay yo kaipers

6537.6 --> 6541.1990000000005
you can see the highest point oh what's

6539.28 --> 6544.96
optics right

6541.199 --> 6548.32
optics are different from geometric

6544.96 --> 6550.8
side on autographic view right

6548.32 --> 6551.44
yeah you can put a line from one place

6550.8 --> 6553.84
to the other

6551.44 --> 6555.44
in actual view though things will

6553.84 --> 6558.32
naturally on confirmed

6555.44 --> 6560.32
flat spaces when you've actually

6558.32 --> 6561.679
measured them to be completely hundred

6560.32 --> 6565.5199999999995
percent flat

6561.679 --> 6567.1990000000005
things will start to obstruct bottom up

6565.52 --> 6569.360000000001
at a natural rate depending on

6567.199 --> 6571.839999999999
observation height so that always

6569.36 --> 6575.28
applies to sight

6571.84 --> 6578.400000000001
it always does so

6575.28 --> 6580.639
yeah things at the bottom in the

6578.4 --> 6581.44
distance will always be obstructed to

6580.639 --> 6583.84
some level

6581.44 --> 6586.159
that's not nonsense that's literally

6583.84 --> 6589.360000000001
visually proven

6586.159 --> 6592.4
you can literally prove it to yourself

6589.36 --> 6594.639
and people have on the internet shown

6592.4 --> 6596.638999999999
the videos

6594.639 --> 6598.639
take an object you move it into the

6596.639 --> 6600.159000000001
distance over a flat surface and guess

6598.639 --> 6601.52
what at some point the bottom is going

6600.159 --> 6602.879999999999
to blur up and then it's going to

6601.52 --> 6605.52
disappear

6602.88 --> 6607.28
that happens that happens on confirmed

6605.52 --> 6609.92
measured flat surfaces

6607.28 --> 6611.92
it's a natural optics related effect

6609.92 --> 6615.04
whatever you're gonna ascribe it to

6611.92 --> 6617.679
it happens provably every single time

6615.04 --> 6620.56
you cannot exclude this

6617.679 --> 6622.8
this happens okay well you're banned

6620.56 --> 6625.84
your [ __ ] scumbag

6622.8 --> 6629.92
piss off [ __ ] ball tart

6625.84 --> 6635.599
[ __ ] there's nothing worse than a dutch

6629.92 --> 6635.599
ball tart disgusting [ __ ] [ __ ] off

6636.88 --> 6639.84
right

6643.119 --> 6645.36
so

6646.4 --> 6653.839999999999
quick procedure what the hell

6655.84 --> 6663.119000000001
dude get the [ __ ] out

6658.96 --> 6663.119
more scumbags just [ __ ] off

6663.679 --> 6671.52
disgusting sociopathic gang of

6667.04 --> 6671.5199999999995
weenies scumbags can all [ __ ] off

6672.719 --> 6680.96
to go to an island somewhere and just

6674.8 --> 6686.0
eat each other

6680.96 --> 6690.0
right anyway i'm gonna round it out

6686.0 --> 6695.19
the last part of it until the next video

6690.0 --> 6725.01
keep it flat

6695.19 --> 6725.009999999999
[Music]

6734.28 --> 6739.3189999999995
[Applause]

6752.0 --> 6754.08
you
