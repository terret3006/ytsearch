[Music]

412.68 --> 414.8
thank you

419.06 --> 426.539
cool I am just thinking in the

422.4 --> 429.17999999999995
background I mean yesterday

426.539 --> 433.62
was a pretty intense day

429.18 --> 436.74
also because just ball busters

433.62 --> 440.699
was pretty long ball Buster's life

436.74 --> 444.24
and then afterward like the guys just

440.699 --> 446.039
kept talking and like Nathan also Nathan

444.24 --> 448.979
and Brian and

446.039 --> 450.96
chocolate Saiyan and Elijah and

448.979 --> 455.96
fractured curvature

450.96 --> 455.96
and they kept talking to like

456.599 --> 459.68
2 am

460.199 --> 465.41900000000004
for me or it was even like 3 A.M I don't

463.259 --> 466.759
know it was just like what the hell it

465.419 --> 470.599
just wouldn't stop

466.759 --> 470.599
it was very interesting

470.9 --> 475.85999999999996
it's kind of like a

473.4 --> 478.02
after after show

475.86 --> 480.36
but just very late

478.02 --> 483.0
so

480.36 --> 484.34000000000003
I might still be a bit blurry

483.0 --> 486.66
because of all that

484.34 --> 488.39
[Music]

486.66 --> 491.56
hey lva Paul

488.39 --> 491.56
[Music]

492.24 --> 495.44
were you there too

499.039 --> 502.34
lva Pole

502.85 --> 507.5
[Music]

504.419 --> 507.5
all right

508.94 --> 512.069
[Music]

517.38 --> 523.86
all right ball busters yeah

520.14 --> 527.279
but I mean it was really just

523.86 --> 529.08
digging on to Whitsett and Jaren most of

527.279 --> 531.54
it really

529.08 --> 533.899
so

531.54 --> 533.899
yeah

537.66 --> 541.1999999999999
I mean I think the guys got it under

539.64 --> 544.38
control

541.2 --> 548.0
sometimes I like like to help with a

544.38 --> 548.0
certain inside here and there but

550.26 --> 555.31
that's just I don't feel like there's a

552.48 --> 562.22
lot I can really add to it at this point

555.31 --> 566.8389999999999
[Music]

562.22 --> 566.839
hey Scott good to see you

568.68 --> 571.459
foreign

577.26 --> 581.22
[Music]

578.959 --> 582.5999999999999
Benjamin he had a special Saturday

581.22 --> 584.94
stream

582.6 --> 588.72
there's basically reading out and giving

584.94 --> 592.1400000000001
commentary on Putin's big speech

588.72 --> 595.32
that I was also reading yesterday

592.14 --> 598.38
before the show yesterday

595.32 --> 600.839
but yeah that was very helpful

598.38 --> 602.58
because then I don't have to look at the

600.839 --> 603.6
screen and try to read letters all the

602.58 --> 605.88
time

603.6 --> 607.98
so just listen to oh and basically

605.88 --> 610.32
reading it out and he had some good

607.98 --> 614.24
commentary too so

610.32 --> 614.24
that was a pretty worthwhile stream

616.26 --> 621.14
I mean that what gave a really big

621.98 --> 627.24
geopolitical type overview

625.26 --> 629.48
so I definitely recommend you check that

627.24 --> 629.48
out

633.62 --> 639.66
it's one hour 42 minutes so

637.62 --> 641.399
it's not like a three hour stream or

639.66 --> 644.7199999999999
anything like

641.399 --> 644.72
check that out

645.6 --> 649.94
oh God yes then Winfield I've seen that

650.459 --> 654.18
means the heart did not take notice of

652.92 --> 656.04
that

654.18 --> 657.79
because it's going to be shot in your

656.04 --> 661.0999999999999
face literally

657.79 --> 661.0999999999999
[Music]

662.399 --> 667.17
everybody want to show how outrageous it

665.579 --> 670.679
was

667.17 --> 670.679
[Music]

678.86 --> 684.54
the world is focused on this right what

682.44 --> 685.5600000000001
they want Pleasant distractions right I

684.54 --> 688.019
mean

685.56 --> 690.3599999999999
you gotta realize the entire world or a

688.019 --> 693.079
lot of people that especially interact

690.36 --> 693.0790000000001
with media

694.44 --> 699.4200000000001
they want the the times of Peace because

697.38 --> 701.88
in the times of Peace Everybody's Free

699.42 --> 705.66
everybody can just be themselves and you

701.88 --> 708.48
can just do things nice and pleasant

705.66 --> 710.16
and just go where your heart wants to go

708.48 --> 714.38
but now

710.16 --> 714.38
it's basically War but it's

715.079 --> 719.16
yeah

716.64 --> 722.16
so there's a lot of like very unpleasant

719.16 --> 726.18
things that keep happening and just

722.16 --> 729.8389999999999
Insanity in the powers that be and

726.18 --> 731.9399999999999
people don't really want to constantly

729.839 --> 735.1800000000001
gobble that down because it's super

731.94 --> 736.86
stressful they want kind of like silly

735.18 --> 739.579
distractions that don't remind them of

736.86 --> 739.5790000000001
that kind of [Â __Â ]

741.74 --> 746.16
so

743.519 --> 749.519
yeah people

746.16 --> 752.76
on social media out there and among

749.519 --> 755.22
friends they're gonna do that

752.76 --> 756.66
because there's a lot of unpleasant

755.22 --> 759.62
things in the world right now to

756.66 --> 759.62
distract away from

762.24 --> 764.66
all right

765.56 --> 770.899
Putin is using it to motivate his

768.24 --> 770.899
objects

772.2 --> 777.38
I hope you don't mean the teacher with

774.36 --> 777.38
the fake breasts right

778.26 --> 784.4399999999999
no but the speech yeah

781.5 --> 787.079
but not just that

784.44 --> 791.0600000000001
he's really doing his best to kind of

787.079 --> 791.06
like translate the general spirit

792.24 --> 798.36
and being really honest about a lot of

795.3 --> 801.4799999999999
things and then also kind of playing

798.36 --> 804.1800000000001
tactical games like trying to play on

801.48 --> 806.639
the language on what has been typically

804.18 --> 809.279
around thinking wise

806.639 --> 811.38
so that everybody can always have some

809.279 --> 814.139
kind of reflection board

811.38 --> 815.459
so it's very fractal

814.139 --> 818.5790000000001
right

815.459 --> 822.0
the whole speech is is a really well

818.579 --> 825.7199999999999
refine the well-chiseled chiseled

822.0 --> 825.72
fractal speech

830.16 --> 832.639
so

836.459 --> 840.1199999999999
attention yeah

840.18 --> 845.54
it's like it's in his head

842.82 --> 845.5400000000001
no

846.72 --> 851.279
no there is

849.0 --> 856.26
right

851.279 --> 856.26
there is like a gay agenda

856.44 --> 863.839
and transgender is just

859.8 --> 866.519
yeah it's it's pure point of that type

863.839 --> 870.0790000000001
and he's totally right and I totally

866.519 --> 870.079
agree with his policies on that

870.72 --> 874.98
yeah I said it

872.519 --> 880.519
and I know I'm in the Netherlands where

874.98 --> 880.519
they try to do the exact opposite but

880.62 --> 885.199
yeah I don't agree with that at all

887.399 --> 892.74
and everybody that's going to yeah be a

891.06 --> 895.68
part of that and subject to that they're

892.74 --> 898.5
all going to pay the price not reprise

895.68 --> 900.54
from the man or the law but just from

898.5 --> 902.72
their own actions having done that and

900.54 --> 904.88
later realizing what the [Â __Â ] they just

902.72 --> 907.26
agreed to

904.88 --> 909.54
right they're all gonna have to learn

907.26 --> 913.639
their lesson like that

909.54 --> 913.639
because I can't do anything to stop them

913.98 --> 918.54
except

915.24 --> 922.0790000000001
give them something to complain about

918.54 --> 927.24
to maybe snap out of it

922.079 --> 927.2399999999999
and try to be more old-fashioned

928.26 --> 932.76
because maybe it was like that for a

931.079 --> 935.459
good reason Maybe

932.76 --> 937.74
the older Generations took that position

935.459 --> 940.56
like that spiritual position for

937.74 --> 941.58
themselves of how to do things for a

940.56 --> 942.779
good reason

941.58 --> 945.5600000000001
[Music]

942.779 --> 945.56
I mean

948.3 --> 954.8389999999999
the older generation is

951.12 --> 958.26
less insane on average they end up less

954.839 --> 959.8800000000001
insane than most of the younger

958.26 --> 962.9399999999999
Generations now

959.88 --> 967.139
that are going insane out of alarming

962.94 --> 970.94
rate quicker at a younger age

967.139 --> 974.399
because of well just information media

970.94 --> 977.5790000000001
overexposure no limitations right the

974.399 --> 979.56
limitation cap being taken off and just

977.579 --> 981.899
people can't just do that that's what

979.56 --> 984.4799999999999
makes people so insane well the older

981.899 --> 987.8
Generations didn't do that because they

984.48 --> 990.3000000000001
knew they had tradition still in like

987.8 --> 993.42
Christianity or other

990.3 --> 996.5999999999999
found even Pagan Traditions just

993.42 --> 998.88
to know what happens to know what

996.6 --> 1001.779
happens when you don't have a cap when

998.88 --> 1001.779
you don't have a

1002.3 --> 1007.12
a place where you just say you don't go

1004.88 --> 1007.12
there

1008.66 --> 1013.54
like Adam

1010.399 --> 1013.54
biting the Apple

1013.759 --> 1020.42
you don't like it has major consequences

1016.779 --> 1022.88
they knew that so they really did their

1020.42 --> 1024.62
best to take that serious and they still

1022.88 --> 1027.86
bought a whole bunch of [Â __Â ]

1024.62 --> 1030.6789999999999
nonsense stories that they took for true

1027.86 --> 1033.74
but they held fast to their principles

1030.679 --> 1036.5590000000002
and it had made them

1033.74 --> 1041.02
old and good

1036.559 --> 1041.02
and durable people a lot of them

1041.66 --> 1049.1000000000001
oh I don't see in the west the newer

1044.959 --> 1052.4
Generations becoming that old I don't

1049.1 --> 1055.34
is because they took the cap off like oh

1052.4 --> 1060.039
we know better oh No Limits and then

1055.34 --> 1060.039
immediately taking a bite off that apple

1060.76 --> 1068.12
with the massive consequences

1064.16 --> 1069.8200000000002
with the loss of God loss of actual good

1068.12 --> 1073.3
ideas that make sense

1069.82 --> 1073.3
[Music]

1073.6 --> 1080.84
being cast into

1076.58 --> 1083.059
the other spiritual Dimension or Satan's

1080.84 --> 1087.82
realm if you will

1083.059 --> 1087.82
another reality with less

1094.039 --> 1097.039
foreign

1099.5 --> 1104.72
right and I think that Russia has really

1102.58 --> 1106.9399999999998
figured this out

1104.72 --> 1110.179
right

1106.94 --> 1112.88
it's weird but I've I'm convinced just

1110.179 --> 1114.8600000000001
from seeing Russian people speak and all

1112.88 --> 1116.6000000000001
that on camera any Russian like even

1114.86 --> 1119.12
some

1116.6 --> 1122.98
not super bright person on the corner of

1119.12 --> 1126.4399999999998
the street to like the really veteran

1122.98 --> 1127.82
politicians like Russians have like a

1126.44 --> 1130.96
spirit

1127.82 --> 1130.96
that they share

1131.6 --> 1137.32
and it is advanced

1134.6 --> 1137.32
it's

1138.98 --> 1146.539
it has more like

1142.58 --> 1148.58
tension behind it it just has more power

1146.539 --> 1150.799
and they share it as long as they tap

1148.58 --> 1153.06
into it and those that don't that reject

1150.799 --> 1156.25
it they go like insane

1153.06 --> 1156.25
[Music]

1159.2 --> 1162.46
isn't that just weird

1162.98 --> 1165.64
right

1166.419 --> 1171.38
it's like either you tap into that power

1169.039 --> 1173.48
and then you get the cohesion and the

1171.38 --> 1175.8200000000002
unity and the purpose and

1173.48 --> 1178.7
and wisdom just

1175.82 --> 1181.82
more easily accessible wisdom

1178.7 --> 1183.799
or you go against it and then yeah you

1181.82 --> 1185.96
take a bite of the Apple you go in the

1183.799 --> 1188.78
other dimension and you lose all the

1185.96 --> 1192.6200000000001
gods rewards and you go insane

1188.78 --> 1195.32
right now technically this is everywhere

1192.62 --> 1198.4599999999998
but I would yeah with the Russians it's

1195.32 --> 1198.46
just so distinct

1204.44 --> 1208.94
and it's like they're all aware of it on

1207.32 --> 1211.1
the subconscious level

1208.94 --> 1214.1200000000001
like they have this real subconscious

1211.1 --> 1214.12
Russian identity

1214.58 --> 1219.08
right and it's about the people

1217.16 --> 1220.76
so they even know like yeah different

1219.08 --> 1224.84
sides of Russia are technically

1220.76 --> 1228.26
different but it's all that awareness

1224.84 --> 1231.74
combined there's no sloppiness

1228.26 --> 1234.26
in it and if people are sloppy and

1231.74 --> 1238.7
mentally or whatever then others kind of

1234.26 --> 1241.16
like yeah whatever you just don't get it

1238.7 --> 1242.059
there's no mistakes like spreading

1241.16 --> 1245.1200000000001
around

1242.059 --> 1246.62
like that this is all getting very acid

1245.12 --> 1248.12
there what I'm saying and it's weird

1246.62 --> 1249.26
because I haven't actually been to

1248.12 --> 1253.0
Russia

1249.26 --> 1253.0
it's all through video

1254.0 --> 1260.26
met a couple of Russian people

1257.299 --> 1261.679
I think that might have been Jews

1260.26 --> 1263.299
[Music]

1261.679 --> 1266.98
huh

1263.299 --> 1270.15
so yeah I can't really compare that

1266.98 --> 1270.15
[Music]

1273.86 --> 1277.539
I believe in collectivism

1277.66 --> 1282.0800000000002
totalitarilitarian what does that even

1280.22 --> 1287.08
mean

1282.08 --> 1287.08
I mean collectivism as in the spirit

1291.799 --> 1297.2
I mean collectivism doesn't

1293.6 --> 1299.32
automatically mean like communism

1297.2 --> 1299.32
thank you

1303.08 --> 1307.059
all right communism the form of

1305.24 --> 1309.919
government

1307.059 --> 1312.6399999999999
collectivism is just

1309.919 --> 1312.64
to me

1317.96 --> 1322.82
I mean

1320.179 --> 1325.76
what's wrong with collectivism don't we

1322.82 --> 1328.3999999999999
all use minor forms of collectivism

1325.76 --> 1331.78
literally all the time as just a

1328.4 --> 1335.299
critical component of social interaction

1331.78 --> 1337.34
I mean seriously what's wrong with

1335.299 --> 1339.98
collectivism it's just

1337.34 --> 1343.1589999999999
it becomes a problem when it's forced

1339.98 --> 1346.28
it's like you're not allowed to have an

1343.159 --> 1350.44
an oppositional opinion

1346.28 --> 1350.44
that's when it becomes a real problem

1353.36 --> 1359.1789999999999
right freedom of speech when that's

1356.299 --> 1363.08
stifle that's when it it can become like

1359.179 --> 1365.8400000000001
communism because they can do that

1363.08 --> 1367.76
they typically end up doing that

1365.84 --> 1370.52
censorship

1367.76 --> 1373.12
and persecution of political deviating

1370.52 --> 1373.12
opinions

1378.98 --> 1381.46
right

1385.28 --> 1388.6
a flutter Sage

1396.82 --> 1401.6589999999999
totalitarian because it requires Force

1399.5 --> 1406.419
to work

1401.659 --> 1406.419
no that's a very weird of saying that

1406.94 --> 1412.22
look anything

1409.7 --> 1415.82
with power

1412.22 --> 1419.059
any organization needs power in order to

1415.82 --> 1421.9399999999998
guarantee that all the work isn't just

1419.059 --> 1424.36
gonna be for nothing

1421.94 --> 1424.3600000000001
right

1429.919 --> 1432.5800000000002
so

1433.6 --> 1438.6789999999999
every

1435.2 --> 1440.299
form of cohesion

1438.679 --> 1445.1000000000001
groups

1440.299 --> 1447.62
people in a certain way require

1445.1 --> 1450.08
Force to work

1447.62 --> 1452.4799999999998
right it might be like

1450.08 --> 1454.6399999999999
in a community the people that they all

1452.48 --> 1457.46
just will spring in to defend themselves

1454.64 --> 1460.88
and they train that or they have police

1457.46 --> 1463.039
or they have a military to do that

1460.88 --> 1464.6200000000001
but seriously

1463.039 --> 1466.82
what

1464.62 --> 1470.62
organization out there

1466.82 --> 1470.62
like of organization

1472.34 --> 1479.4189999999999
what nation out there

1476.179 --> 1483.1000000000001
or what bigger Community completely

1479.419 --> 1483.1000000000001
Works without Force

1488.78 --> 1493.1589999999999
I mean if it's something that's just

1490.82 --> 1495.98
like a labor movement

1493.159 --> 1497.96
or cultural movement that's super cool

1495.98 --> 1501.8600000000001
that technically Works without Force

1497.96 --> 1504.02
until [Â __Â ] happens and then Force like

1501.86 --> 1507.86
is subjected to them

1504.02 --> 1510.32
and then either people stand up and and

1507.86 --> 1513.1999999999998
they get kind of like counter force in

1510.32 --> 1516.799
response or they break up until the

1513.2 --> 1520.88
force situation military or whatever it

1516.799 --> 1524.6
is Civil War something goes away

1520.88 --> 1527.0
so it's the force that keeps it in place

1524.6 --> 1530.6589999999999
that guarantees

1527.0 --> 1532.58
the safety of the laborers that it's not

1530.659 --> 1534.7600000000002
all just going to be scorched and blown

1532.58 --> 1534.76

when it's that big it's gonna happen

1593.539 --> 1596.559
it's gonna build

1596.779 --> 1601.039

1598.159 --> 1604.46
it's not the perfect free

it's not like an idyllic Society

1604.46 --> 1610.1000000000001

1606.38 --> 1612.2600000000002
the people itself are relatively in high

moral strength

1612.26 --> 1615.039

about anything they do pretty much

1670.279 --> 1673.059

1678.5 --> 1683.2

1680.84 --> 1683.1999999999998
been doing

nobody should be pointing at them at

stands for I was rumored here that it

1724.76 --> 1728.86
was World War Z exactly related

they're just slandering milk as being

1875.14 --> 1879.5590000000002
racist here

1877.52 --> 1882.039
just like in the United States a few

1879.559 --> 1882.039
years ago

1902.539 --> 1908.02
welcome back PGC net

1929.84 --> 1934.059
hey in that track fellow good to see you

1943.039 --> 1949.299
only country to create new Farmland yeah

1946.52 --> 1949.299
effectively

1956.299 --> 1963.74
and hey when you think about it

1959.899 --> 1967.82
if we were able to do that here

1963.74 --> 1969.44
what is it now 300 years ago

1967.82 --> 1971.36
something like that

1969.44 --> 1972.7
then

1971.36 --> 1975.86
yeah

1972.7 --> 1979.46
why would it not be able to

1975.86 --> 1982.12
why wouldn't it be possible to do that

1979.46 --> 1982.1200000000001
elsewhere

1983.12 --> 1988.1589999999999
personally I've always thought of like

1986.24 --> 1991.76
I don't know if it's actually worth it

1988.159 --> 1994.22
but I have no yeah I'm not

1991.76 --> 1996.799
but like why not try to do something

1994.22 --> 1999.26
like that with Bangladesh

1996.799 --> 2003.299
I mean that country is constantly

1999.26 --> 2003.299
getting ravaged by floods

2004.84 --> 2010.4189999999999
why not just

2007.6 --> 2013.84
actually stabilize that and

2010.419 --> 2017.14
get some good Water Works going so that

2013.84 --> 2020.039
there could be more stable and secure

2017.14 --> 2020.039
industry there

2021.399 --> 2027.4599999999998
right of whatever sort the people will

2025.0 --> 2030.1
be good at I don't know

2027.46 --> 2033.46
clothing

2030.1 --> 2035.62
yeah what yeah whatever type of work but

2033.46 --> 2040.1200000000001
I think that Bangladeshi people also

2035.62 --> 2042.9399999999998
typically go to other countries to work

2040.12 --> 2044.1399999999999
well if this would be built then they

2042.94 --> 2049.32
could

2044.14 --> 2049.32
just basically keep working at home huh

2054.04 --> 2058.06
yeah on the other hand there will

2056.02 --> 2060.04
probably be a couple of countries that

2058.06 --> 2061.96
wouldn't be helped me are happy about

2060.04 --> 2063.099
that because then they get don't get

2061.96 --> 2066.48
their

2063.099 --> 2066.48
cheap laborers

2069.94 --> 2076.26
or maybe they will all depends on

2073.78 --> 2076.26
like

2076.96 --> 2081.04
what Bangladesh's business models would

2079.599 --> 2082.8990000000003
be

2081.04 --> 2085.56
right but I do think about these things

2082.899 --> 2085.56
it's like

2090.04 --> 2095.04
all these places can literally be turned

2092.98 --> 2097.78
into like

2095.04 --> 2101.74
stabilized productive regions instead of

2097.78 --> 2104.1600000000003
constant trash and misery and illegal

2101.74 --> 2104.16
[Â __Â ]

2104.44 --> 2108.4
because of that

2105.94 --> 2110.68
because it's just the entire Place keeps

2108.4 --> 2112.599
breaking down that also means lack of

2110.68 --> 2114.7599999999998
cohesion and that means that criminals

2112.599 --> 2117.7000000000003

2313.42 --> 2318.42
I didn't even know that but that's how

2315.88 --> 2318.42
they make it

2321.94 --> 2328.98
it's like a component in the

2324.94 --> 2328.98
in the chemical process to make it

2329.38 --> 2333.46
and so if the natural gas is suddenly

2331.54 --> 2335.56
cut off everywhere

2333.46 --> 2337.18
then all the countries that normally

2335.56 --> 2340.18
make that

2337.18 --> 2343.54
even for their own Industries

2340.18 --> 2346.1189999999997
yeah gets cut off

2343.54 --> 2350.7
and for I think

2346.119 --> 2354.04
base f like one of the biggest chemical

2350.7 --> 2357.7
companies in the world arguably

2354.04 --> 2359.74
like I think it's German originally but

2357.7 --> 2363.52
yeah there's a big industry area there

2359.74 --> 2366.16
in Germany and they make fertilizer

2363.52 --> 2368.7
using natural gas which the country does

2366.16 --> 2368.7
not have

2370.48 --> 2375.04
and the north stream

2372.4 --> 2378.04
was actually the

2375.04 --> 2378.04
provider

2378.099 --> 2381.88
so yeah

2380.2 --> 2384.8199999999997
like that

2381.88 --> 2388.599
Mega Industrial

2384.82 --> 2391.2400000000002
area is in big trouble I mean it could

2388.599 --> 2394.42
be shut down and who knows man with

2391.24 --> 2396.0989999999997
Machinery that big when you shut it down

2394.42 --> 2398.2000000000003
like they don't know if they could even

2396.099 --> 2401.079
start it up again

2398.2 --> 2403.18
because those things I think keep

2401.079 --> 2405.04
running just continually

2403.18 --> 2406.96
and they've like once they start up

2405.04 --> 2408.52
they'd never shut off except for

2406.96 --> 2410.98
maintenance and then even they don't

2408.52 --> 2414.06
even fully shut up just the part that

2410.98 --> 2414.06
requires maintenance

2414.46 --> 2419.14
and so if the processes cannot be

2417.46 --> 2422.5
complete the entire thing has to shut

2419.14 --> 2425.14
down and then it basically collapses

2422.5 --> 2428.2
and it requires a huge investment even

2425.14 --> 2429.7599999999998
to just get it back running up

2428.2 --> 2432.52
so

2429.76 --> 2434.619
you didn't know that well

2432.52 --> 2437.5
now you do

2434.619 --> 2440.88
I mean this is serious serious

2437.5 --> 2440.88
industrial sabotage

2441.88 --> 2447.52
by the United States overtly and and

2445.359 --> 2452.16
them actually having the goal to say

2447.52 --> 2452.16
that Russia did it that's Putin did it

2454.02 --> 2457.32
I mean

2462.88 --> 2470.04
I don't even have anybody in history to

2466.3 --> 2470.04
compare such an action to

2472.42 --> 2477.96
right maybe Caligula or something did

2475.66 --> 2477.96
that

2479.56 --> 2484.98
or Nero

2482.02 --> 2484.98
I don't know

2486.28 --> 2494.099
but it's just so overtly evil and insane

2491.02 --> 2497.8
and projection and

2494.099 --> 2500.76
idea you can't really compare them

2497.8 --> 2500.76
easily anyway

2505.599 --> 2510.7200000000003
it does my building use natural gas for

2507.94 --> 2510.7200000000003
eating yeah

2514.119 --> 2518.52
it's standard part of the radiator

2516.16 --> 2518.52
system

2520.98 --> 2528.42
but I have electric heating too so I

2525.16 --> 2528.42
tend to prefer that

2529.78 --> 2534.76
right but relatively the Netherlands has

2533.8 --> 2536.26
less

2534.76 --> 2539.32
problems

2536.26 --> 2541.0
because we actually have natural gas

2539.32 --> 2546.54
production

2541.0 --> 2546.54
it's just turn off or barely turned on

2546.579 --> 2551.5600000000004
because of environmental complaints Etc

2549.76 --> 2555.4
but we have

2551.56 --> 2559.72
like it what is it

2555.4 --> 2562.42
like it an eighth of like the country is

2559.72 --> 2564.0989999999997
rich in gas ground like in the northern

2562.42 --> 2566.619
part

2564.099 --> 2569.26
the most northern provinces

2566.619 --> 2572.079
it's pretty rich and

2569.26 --> 2575.0400000000004
I it's not gonna last for a century or

2572.079 --> 2577.2400000000002
something but yeah it could definitely

2575.04 --> 2580.06
help us out

2577.24 --> 2582.06
I mean it could keep our country running

2580.06 --> 2586.0
probably

2582.06 --> 2588.22
if we can get politicians to just

2586.0 --> 2591.46
turn it on

2588.22 --> 2594.0989999999997
but these politicians that's that would

2591.46 --> 2596.56
be the politicians that basically caused

2594.099 --> 2598.3
this giant Calamity and

2596.56 --> 2600.94
yeah

2598.3 --> 2602.8500000000004
so they're not gonna do that they're

2600.94 --> 2607.119
just gonna let us choke

2602.85 --> 2607.1189999999997
[Music]

2608.26 --> 2613.42
or maybe they'll like give it away to

2611.2 --> 2614.98
Germany or something right I mean I'd

2613.42 --> 2617.2000000000003
see

2614.98 --> 2619.2400000000002
I'd see these politicians here do

2617.2 --> 2621.16
something out as outrageous as that is

2619.24 --> 2623.6189999999997
to just like oh yeah we're gonna up the

2621.16 --> 2624.8799999999997
production and then give it away to

2623.619 --> 2628.02
Europe

2624.88 --> 2628.02
because of the emergency

2628.63 --> 2634.0
[Music]

2632.02 --> 2637.96
so yeah it all depends like yeah how

2634.0 --> 2640.599
long is it gonna take before simply

2637.96 --> 2642.339
people in the country including industry

2640.599 --> 2644.619
are just gonna say like

2642.339 --> 2648.72
uh no

2644.619 --> 2648.7200000000003
no we're not gonna do that

2648.96 --> 2654.339
you have to step down

2652.3 --> 2656.02
and make place for an actual government

2654.339 --> 2659.2799999999997
and not

2656.02 --> 2659.28
like an obvious

2659.46 --> 2663.06
infiltrating agency

2673.56 --> 2676.619
[Music]

2679.3 --> 2681.78
thank you

2682.96 --> 2686.13
[Music]

2688.72 --> 2693.839
is that that could have started World

2690.64 --> 2693.839
War III no it is

2694.0 --> 2701.22
World War III has started

2697.06 --> 2701.22
it's happening it's just not

2701.46 --> 2707.44
Flex down here come the the tanks or

2705.04 --> 2709.06
something right that's not how this one

2707.44 --> 2711.66
works

2709.06 --> 2711.66
foreign

2712.74 --> 2719.14
is that the bigger parties are actually

2716.14 --> 2722.92
really gonna cut off ties

2719.14 --> 2726.339
like create actual isolation now which

2722.92 --> 2728.56
is totally gonna devastate

2726.339 --> 2732.0
like a whole bunch of regions

2728.56 --> 2732.0
industrially and all that

2733.66 --> 2738.819
is war

2736.599 --> 2742.0
first thing War

2738.819 --> 2745.119
tends to like real big ones tends to

2742.0 --> 2747.7
ruin is industry

2745.119 --> 2750.04
or yeah things like chemical industry

2747.7 --> 2753.2799999999997
things that are dependent on lots of

2750.04 --> 2758.88
resource creations and

2753.28 --> 2758.88
so like power industry for example

2759.7 --> 2763.0789999999997
and the chemical industry

2763.54 --> 2769.06
so that's happening and yeah there might

2766.96 --> 2772.0
have been a solution

2769.06 --> 2773.319
they just left it alone but no they

2772.0 --> 2775.599
insist

2773.319 --> 2777.7599999999998
and says no you're not getting you're

2775.599 --> 2780.4
not gonna get it you're we are literally

2777.76 --> 2784.3590000000004
going to be grandstanding against one

2780.4 --> 2787.14
another and let you starve to death

2784.359 --> 2787.14
all of you

2788.92 --> 2791.94
they insist

2794.56 --> 2803.04
right so here comes my solution

2799.42 --> 2803.04
that even is a solution

2804.04 --> 2810.84
we just freaking kill him

2808.0 --> 2812.26
as in the public

2810.84 --> 2816.6600000000003
[Music]

2812.26 --> 2816.6600000000003
an actual revolt and not just

2817.06 --> 2820.7799999999997
whining light up like a baby a little

2819.22 --> 2823.7799999999997
louder

2820.78 --> 2825.88
but actually do it like it would be done

2823.78 --> 2829.119
in medieval times

2825.88 --> 2831.04
I mean this is Neo feudalism right so

2829.119 --> 2836.38
why not invoke

2831.04 --> 2838.06
the public feudal Clause of okay really

2836.38 --> 2841.1800000000003
you think you can get away with that

2838.06 --> 2844.42
okay then we'll kill you

2841.18 --> 2847.56
with rakes and torches

2844.42 --> 2847.56
and axis

2853.119 --> 2858.7200000000003
yeah

2854.2 --> 2858.72
I mean this is Neo feudalism right

2860.339 --> 2867.22
they they wanted it this way

2863.56 --> 2868.7799999999997
so why not actually realize how that

2867.22 --> 2872.74
works

2868.78 --> 2875.079
and then take the power back from within

2872.74 --> 2876.22
that system

2875.079 --> 2878.8
because

2876.22 --> 2881.68
yeah that's the the way that's the only

2878.8 --> 2885.76
way and it's always disastrous I mean

2881.68 --> 2889.8999999999996
every time a serious Revolt would be in

2885.76 --> 2891.6400000000003
it would absolutely like rearrange how

2889.9 --> 2893.5
everything worked but a lot of the times

2891.64 --> 2896.02
like Villages that did that they would

2893.5 --> 2899.319
just all be murdered

2896.02 --> 2900.88
by like the Lord next over that then

2899.319 --> 2903.7
came visiting they would just kill

2900.88 --> 2905.079
everybody if they resisted or if they

2903.7 --> 2907.4199999999996
revolted

2905.079 --> 2908.26
right and that's why the people have to

2907.42 --> 2911.02
be

2908.26 --> 2913.3
actually brutal about it

2911.02 --> 2915.16
and I also realized like once you go

2913.3 --> 2917.5600000000004
there

2915.16 --> 2920.2799999999997
once you get that type of blood on your

2917.56 --> 2923.44
hands you're like a well an outcast

2920.28 --> 2925.98
you're probably gonna be forever until

2923.44 --> 2925.98
you die

2928.9 --> 2933.579
but yeah

2931.42 --> 2936.119
you could also be like a Robin Hood

2933.579 --> 2936.119
about it

2942.64 --> 2946.2999999999997
I don't know

2944.079 --> 2949.96
this is pretty much where my expertise

2946.3 --> 2952.7200000000003
if you even can call it that stops

2949.96 --> 2955.9
just seeking out patterns and like okay

2952.72 --> 2958.66
so Neo feudalism right okay well

2955.9 --> 2963.7200000000003
what happened during feudal times

2958.66 --> 2967.06
starvation deprivation of knowledge

2963.72 --> 2968.98
Siege always the [Â __Â ] Siege every

2967.06 --> 2971.339
time

2968.98 --> 2974.02
and

2971.339 --> 2977.2
bloody ass Revolt with

2974.02 --> 2979.66
yeah the the rulers that [Â __Â ] it up

2977.2 --> 2981.64
majorly and let there just did horrible

2979.66 --> 2982.5989999999997
things and they were oh they were

2981.64 --> 2985.48
freaking

2982.599 --> 2987.7000000000003
grappling rapist and like child

2985.48 --> 2990.22
murderers you can't believe like what

2987.7 --> 2992.9199999999996
some of these feudal

2990.22 --> 2996.52
Lords back in the day could be like

2992.92 --> 2997.48
then they would literally go medieval on

2996.52 --> 3001.619
them

2997.48 --> 3004.56
and yeah like on the on the Public

3001.619 --> 3007.079
Square torture them like all of them

3004.56 --> 3009.54
would literally like okay

3007.079 --> 3013.579
first we do this then we do that and

3009.54 --> 3013.579
then we finish it off like this

3016.68 --> 3019.22
yep

3023.76 --> 3028.92
all right and

3026.16 --> 3030.54
in a way it would also help because if

3028.92 --> 3032.339
they

3030.54 --> 3037.64
those people

3032.339 --> 3037.64
that they did that the weird thing was

3037.99 --> 3042.2999999999997
[Applause]

3039.96 --> 3044.4
that even in funeral times the Lords and

3042.3 --> 3047.04
all that would always make it into a

3044.4 --> 3049.339
tactical game anyway so I guess that

3047.04 --> 3049.339
yeah

3051.48 --> 3056.16
you could almost say that they would

3052.98 --> 3059.28
just let that happen it's like okay this

3056.16 --> 3062.04
person is literally like no longer

3059.28 --> 3064.6800000000003
working with our long-term plan of

3062.04 --> 3066.18
inter-marriage blah blah blah and

3064.68 --> 3068.7599999999998
they're failing and people hate them

3066.18 --> 3071.46
okay just let them

3068.76 --> 3075.059
like they would been like oh okay we're

3071.46 --> 3080.52
gonna retract this specific guard group

3075.059 --> 3082.98
and then Lawrence would be like uh okay

3080.52 --> 3085.88
now I'm screwed and then people would

3082.98 --> 3085.88
just [Â __Â ] them up

3087.54 --> 3093.66
right but that's not really because of

3091.619 --> 3095.339
their decision and it's like something

3093.66 --> 3097.3799999999997
that's just waiting to happen and then

3095.339 --> 3100.94
the protection being taken away and then

3097.38 --> 3100.94
it just ravage them

3102.9 --> 3105.98
so I

3106.319 --> 3110.7
I don't really know sometimes

3108.839 --> 3113.64
like what it is

3110.7 --> 3117.7999999999997
that I'm actually trying to communicate

3113.64 --> 3117.7999999999997
when I talk about this sort of thing

3119.46 --> 3127.2
it's just that this just standing by and

3123.48 --> 3131.66
enduring and enduring and enduring

3127.2 --> 3131.66
like this cannot be it

3136.74 --> 3143.7
I mean that is just too close to

3140.88 --> 3146.1600000000003
ignoring

3143.7 --> 3148.14
it's too close to ignoring

3146.16 --> 3151.64
and ignorance

3148.14 --> 3151.64
is of Satan

3153.119 --> 3155.54
right

3157.02 --> 3162.68
so

3159.24 --> 3162.68
how is that gonna work

3163.559 --> 3169.3190000000004
what is the format of response that

3166.5 --> 3171.3
people can do in in response to this

3169.319 --> 3174.14
neo-fuel

3171.3 --> 3174.1400000000003
Siege

3180.9 --> 3187.52
right like how do we get these

3183.619 --> 3187.52
institutes back under control

3203.88 --> 3206.48
anyway

3208.559 --> 3211.28
foreign

3216.03 --> 3219.199
[Music]

3223.04 --> 3228.119
rulers though or just useful minions

3225.72 --> 3230.7599999999998
idiots yeah

3228.119 --> 3233.52
well the thing is is that it doesn't

3230.76 --> 3235.5
matter if they're just full guys if

3233.52 --> 3237.599
they're the ones that are taking that

3235.5 --> 3240.3
position to do that then they must pay

3237.599 --> 3243.319
right if you don't make the fall guys

3240.3 --> 3243.319
like that pay

3243.42 --> 3247.8
unless it's like a really an outsider

3245.7 --> 3249.0589999999997
had nothing to do with it

3247.8 --> 3251.7000000000003
but like

3249.059 --> 3253.559
yeah if they're actually involved in

3251.7 --> 3255.839
what happened then that

3253.559 --> 3258.3590000000004
doesn't matter if like the others are

3255.839 --> 3261.0
using them as a scapegoat in that moment

3258.359 --> 3262.619
to to get the blame off them in that

3261.0 --> 3266.88
moment

3262.619 --> 3269.819
it just needs to be seen by the people

3266.88 --> 3273.0
that pull that [Â __Â ] off

3269.819 --> 3275.52
needs to be seen that there is a massive

3273.0 --> 3279.72
price to doing that

3275.52 --> 3283.04
to going there to letting that happen

3279.72 --> 3283.04
they need to know

3287.46 --> 3292.28
doesn't matter if they're a scapegoat

3289.619 --> 3296.04
and there's more involved even better

3292.28 --> 3298.3190000000004
there's more involved than they that are

3296.04 --> 3301.079
trying to stay out of it they may need

3298.319 --> 3304.079
to see you like look at that yeah

3301.079 --> 3306.8
that should be happening to you too and

3304.079 --> 3306.8
it might still

3307.66 --> 3310.739

wow time is flying

3341.16 --> 3344.2999999999997
right so

3345.599 --> 3350.52
do you see what I'm trying to do

3348.42 --> 3352.6800000000003
and what I have been trying to do for

3350.52 --> 3356.16
such a long time

3352.68 --> 3358.5589999999997
tied in with my rage win and everything

3356.16 --> 3359.5789999999997
like I'm actually trying to figure this

3358.559 --> 3362.7000000000003
out

3359.579 --> 3365.4
like what is the right

3362.7 --> 3369.48
I mean there must be something there

3365.4 --> 3372.26
there must be something there that even

3369.48 --> 3375.48
that could reformat

3372.26 --> 3377.7000000000003
what the a public response even from

3375.48 --> 3379.559
those that aren't super sophisticated

3377.7 --> 3382.6189999999997
and developed

3379.559 --> 3385.8590000000004
that there would be another thing to do

3382.619 --> 3388.02
then other than just be

3385.859 --> 3390.0
and like oh I have to troll on social

3388.02 --> 3392.28
media because I'm so angry about this

3390.0 --> 3395.579
thing that I can't do anything about or

3392.28 --> 3399.92
like go to protest constantly

3395.579 --> 3399.92
I mean there must be something else

3400.04 --> 3406.02
it must be there I feel there has to be

3403.619 --> 3409.559
something there and

3406.02 --> 3410.88
in my fantasy I seek the solution in

3409.559 --> 3413.099
like

3410.88 --> 3416.88
wrap it quick

3413.099 --> 3420.839
resolve that includes violence

3416.88 --> 3423.599
but then I do not know like how how to

3420.839 --> 3426.18
resolve that from after that point

3423.599 --> 3430.5
and I realized that

3426.18 --> 3433.5
with no plan to actually start rolling

3430.5 --> 3437.96
out directly that you basically leave

3433.5 --> 3437.96
yourself open to be immediately replaced

3439.859 --> 3443.2999999999997
I am aware of this

3449.579 --> 3456.119
I

3452.52 --> 3459.359
was basically don't really

3456.119 --> 3461.7000000000003
have or didn't have so far a better

3459.359 --> 3464.0589999999997
angle of approach and I'm trying to work

3461.7 --> 3464.0589999999997
on it

3471.38 --> 3477.119
yeah but when I say violence I don't

3474.78 --> 3479.059
mean like oh let's just

3477.119 --> 3482.6400000000003
Break Stuff

3479.059 --> 3484.8590000000004
or trash the businesses or even the

3482.64 --> 3487.74
houses although yeah

3484.859 --> 3489.9
and that might just happen after all if

3487.74 --> 3492.72
people or make themselves hated enough

3489.9 --> 3497.04
and they have made themselves very

3492.72 --> 3499.5589999999997
despised that may just happen once once

3497.04 --> 3501.0589999999997
that match keeps go gets going it like

3499.559 --> 3503.6400000000003
you don't even have to plan it people

3501.059 --> 3506.2200000000003
might just start doing that it's like

3503.64 --> 3508.6189999999997
yeah we know where they live and when

3506.22 --> 3510.359
that match lights we're gonna torch all

3508.619 --> 3513.1800000000003
of it

3510.359 --> 3515.9
them inside if necessary

3513.18 --> 3515.8999999999996
I don't know

3521.099 --> 3527.2200000000003
but when I say violence I mean Force I

3525.0 --> 3531.38
don't necessarily mean just shoot people

3527.22 --> 3531.3799999999997
or something I mean Force like

3532.319 --> 3540.839
forming a unit to go in and arrest them

3536.7 --> 3544.2
basically kidnap them openly

3540.839 --> 3546.24
put them in a place under guard

3544.2 --> 3547.9199999999996
and then

3546.24 --> 3551.0
organize

3547.92 --> 3551.0
their trial

3552.78 --> 3559.2000000000003
with communication

3555.119 --> 3562.5
of course I mean it's not like oh like a

3559.2 --> 3565.6189999999997
kangaroo court no

3562.5 --> 3568.079
that would be yeah then then it's like

3565.619 --> 3569.76
just killing them all right that will be

3568.079 --> 3571.92
the effective result you will just be

3569.76 --> 3574.44
seen as terrorists after that even if

3571.92 --> 3575.88
they deserved it

3574.44 --> 3578.099
so

3575.88 --> 3580.1400000000003
that is kind of

3578.099 --> 3583.5
the idea

3580.14 --> 3586.92
but yeah over here I don't know who the

3583.5 --> 3589.74
hell's gonna do that who could do that

3586.92 --> 3592.02
and haven't they all been already marked

3589.74 --> 3594.0
and tagged and like Have Eyes massively

3592.02 --> 3596.339
on them scared that they might actually

3594.0 --> 3599.28
go and engage to do this

3596.339 --> 3602.72
all right who can do that here in the

3641.52 --> 3647.54
earlier but that's just not even close

3643.74 --> 3650.5789999999997
to enough it was a one-time thing

3647.54 --> 3653.22

3653.22 --> 3659.8799999999997

3892.26 --> 3898.559
considered like

3894.119 --> 3900.839
feed for Animals yeah so

3898.559 --> 3903.119
you can literally just

3900.839 --> 3906.44
like have seeds

3903.119 --> 3906.44
supposedly as feed

3917.099 --> 3922.6800000000003
you can buy seasoned fishing tackle shop

of like do on the side not like make a

4412.34 --> 4416.12
business out of it but just like a

4414.26 --> 4419.360000000001
couple of places where I go I could just

4416.12 --> 4422.36
say like hey I got raw tobacco and I'm

4419.36 --> 4424.54
like if you know anybody looking for

4422.36 --> 4424.54
that

4424.94 --> 4430.12

4503.0 --> 4509.719
lva but I are actually like thinking of

4505.88 --> 4511.6990000000005
like the business aspects of doing that

4509.719 --> 4515.38
I mean

4511.699 --> 4519.5599999999995
I'm totally and I'm I am like business

4515.38 --> 4522.8
wise very incompetent I've never been

4519.56 --> 4525.7390000000005
good at that I'm always a noob

4522.8 --> 4528.08
or that sort of thing I have no idea how

4525.739 --> 4532.48
setting it up works

4528.08 --> 4532.48
like I don't understand even what it is

4545.96 --> 4548.92

4565.179 --> 4571.96
wow okay Alfie

4568.34 --> 4571.96
guess you're a natural at it

4579.38 --> 4581.56
thank you

4620.3 --> 4622.42
thank you

4626.78 --> 4633.32
okay yeah I don't want to talk to you

4630.32 --> 4637.12
sometime like

4633.32 --> 4637.12
over Skype or something

4637.46 --> 4644.4800000000005
I mean I could sure use some advice and

4640.94 --> 4646.94
insight I mean I guys I might just like

4644.48 --> 4650.12
indeed start a business but

4646.94 --> 4653.36
I am just so at a losses to how any of

4650.12 --> 4657.5
that works it sounds [Â __Â ] but I kind

4653.36 --> 4660.08
of need somebody to hold my hand

4657.5 --> 4661.52
for a while until I just figure out what

4660.08 --> 4663.679
the hell this is

4661.52 --> 4666.76
like how it actually works and the

4663.679 --> 4666.76
actual consequences

4683.239 --> 4688.28
hmm

4685.699 --> 4690.799999999999
because I I mean if it's like possible

4688.28 --> 4696.159
even to just like do it legally and just

4690.8 --> 4696.159000000001
like import tobacco and then raw tobacco

4702.5 --> 4705.1
like

4705.86 --> 4710.78
what can you do I mean if I can do it

4708.56 --> 4715.42
it's all legal and still make like a

4710.78 --> 4715.42
profit out of it that would be great

4716.3 --> 4720.1990000000005
but I have no idea how that sort of

4718.52 --> 4722.4800000000005
thing works it's with me it's always

4720.199 --> 4726.199
like I

4722.48 --> 4729.879999999999
really tend to kind of avoid

4726.199 --> 4729.879999999999
even thinking about money

4742.54 --> 4747.5
anyway

4744.64 --> 4749.8
so yeah maybe I'll talk to you about

4747.5 --> 4749.8
that

4750.02 --> 4754.159000000001
or we could talk about that maybe like

4753.08 --> 4757.159
um

4754.159 --> 4760.37
on guild at some time or something

4757.159 --> 4763.5599999999995

electromagnetic field manipulation but

what

5235.86 --> 5242.98
I mean any time any time of

5240.0 --> 5246.52
electromagnetic manipulation like for

5242.98 --> 5248.86
example harp right which is the thing

5246.52 --> 5251.26
that supposedly did that

5248.86 --> 5255.04
there's multiple of them now

5251.26 --> 5258.46
you see very distinct effects don't you

5255.04 --> 5260.8
like the rainbow colors and subtly

5258.46 --> 5262.12
appearing in the clouds that kind of

5260.8 --> 5264.58
thing

5262.12 --> 5267.58
so was there any of those types of

5264.58 --> 5270.5199999999995
sightings or is it just blabbermouthing

5267.58 --> 5272.92

purpose

5282.699 --> 5285.419999999999
what

5289.239 --> 5294.58
what do you mean on radar

5292.12 --> 5297.04
radar doesn't pick up

laser beams

5297.04 --> 5302.219
seeking star water what a weird thing to

5300.04 --> 5302.219
say

5302.62 --> 5307.719
I mean laser is light

5305.98 --> 5312.48
radar

5307.719 --> 5312.4800000000005
is not gonna pick that up

5315.51 --> 5318.709
[Music]

5333.639 --> 5337.96
all right

5335.32 --> 5341.98
if you're gonna say there's like a

5337.96 --> 5344.38
magnetic pulse or something like

5341.98 --> 5347.98
that was happening and you might see

5344.38 --> 5350.28
that lines shooting from

5347.98 --> 5350.28
what

5354.78 --> 5360.179
you mean lines shooting from an area

5364.48 --> 5370.48
I mean did you see that

5367.179 --> 5372.9400000000005
with actual camera visual something you

5370.48 --> 5374.98
saw or was it something that was just

5372.94 --> 5377.28
put into an animation for some weird

5374.98 --> 5377.28
reason

5388.719 --> 5392.38
a lightning strikes show up on your

5390.76 --> 5395.02
radar app

5392.38 --> 5397.42
right but that makes sense Dimitri Elder

5395.02 --> 5398.8
because lightning actually creates

5397.42 --> 5402.52
plasma

5398.8 --> 5404.62
in that one fragment of a moment which

5402.52 --> 5406.620000000001
is like

5404.62 --> 5409.36
yeah

5406.62 --> 5411.94
it's definitely like a material

5409.36 --> 5413.739
alteration so the radar should bounce

5411.94 --> 5418.62
off that

5413.739 --> 5418.62
but only in that fraction of a second

5426.52 --> 5430.8
but light is light

5444.34 --> 5451.42
oh yeah since when they claim to but

5449.08 --> 5453.34
they claim a whole bunch of idiotic

5451.42 --> 5454.3
things so does that matter what they

5453.34 --> 5456.34
claim

5454.3 --> 5459.28
I mean there's weather manipulation

5456.34 --> 5462.1
programs and they're laid out they're

5459.28 --> 5464.679
all written down you can look up exactly

5462.1 --> 5467.4400000000005
what it is that they can and probably

5464.679 --> 5470.26
will and have been doing

5467.44 --> 5471.4
you can literally look that up

5470.26 --> 5474.58
so

5471.4 --> 5477.839999999999
did anything happen that would fit into

5474.58 --> 5480.159
one of the categories of how they can

5477.84 --> 5481.659000000001
manipulate the weather according to a

5480.159 --> 5483.5199999999995

5518.8 --> 5524.62
like well it does in the storm season in

5522.159 --> 5527.199
America especially Florida this keeps

5524.62 --> 5529.599999999999
happening yeah it's not because somebody

5527.199 --> 5532.12
pushed a button and I did it on purpose

5529.6 --> 5535.42
they made it work no it's just always

5541.12 --> 5545.159
they have a terrible storm look at all

it's not man-made it just happens there

5554.159 --> 5557.82
every single time

5561.3 --> 5566.9400000000005

5624.04 --> 5628.659
are not oh look they once said in this

5628.659 --> 5634.32
that they can do that or they tweet at

there is weather manipulation going on

5669.52 --> 5674.7390000000005
degree yeah it is a thing

5671.679 --> 5678.04
but it's mostly thus far from what I've

5674.739 --> 5681.718999999999
concluded weather management

5678.04 --> 5681.719
and straight out assault

5681.88 --> 5685.179
like what they like to do in California

5683.44 --> 5688.919999999999
it's just

5699.76 --> 5706.42
foreign

5702.06 --> 5708.6990000000005
but actual effective weather engineering

5706.42 --> 5710.8
I've not seen a lot of that maybe they

5708.699 --> 5713.0199999999995
do that over here I mean the weather has

5710.8 --> 5716.7390000000005
been pretty stable

5713.02 --> 5718.780000000001
and it is like sporadic with the trails

5716.739 --> 5721.78
there's entire days where there's just

5718.78 --> 5724.78
nothing it's super super clean and today

5721.78 --> 5727.5599999999995
is again one of those days look at this

5724.78 --> 5727.5599999999995
look at that

5729.699 --> 5733.54
no Trail

5731.38 --> 5736.659000000001
whatsoever

5733.54 --> 5739.9
but then another moment or a few days

5736.659 --> 5741.159
later suddenly there's Trails all over

5739.9 --> 5744.719
the place

5741.159 --> 5744.719
and then the weather changes

5745.42 --> 5750.88
so I think that they probably are

5748.06 --> 5754.120000000001
actually applying basic geoengineering

5750.88 --> 5756.159000000001
here over my country

5754.12 --> 5759.4
for well

5756.159 --> 5760.9
weather stabilization making it better I

5759.4 --> 5762.759999999999
mean I don't feel like we're getting

5760.9 --> 5766.299999999999
poisoned here

5762.76 --> 5767.9800000000005
so that is what geoengineering really is

5766.3 --> 5770.5
to me it's just weather management

5767.98 --> 5774.159
stabilization

5770.5 --> 5777.219
making sure that everything just

5774.159 --> 5779.62
keeps stable and that nothing is ruined

5777.219 --> 5781.64

5790.54 --> 5797.139

5794.679 --> 5800.86
because that's basically what the claim

5797.139 --> 5803.92
is then oh they used geo-engineering to

5800.86 --> 5806.5
make it worse oh so you think weather

5803.92 --> 5809.02
Warfare is it

5806.5 --> 5812.62
really

5809.02 --> 5814.719
well show the evidence then

5812.62 --> 5817.719
where's the leads

5814.719 --> 5820.84
where did things get unnatural

5817.719 --> 5823.54
where did suddenly something that seems

5820.84 --> 5826.360000000001
very out of place pop up

5823.54 --> 5828.719
rainbow colored clouds in the middle of

5826.36 --> 5828.719
the storm

5828.82 --> 5835.38
or a huge Spike of energy suddenly

5832.719 --> 5835.38
popping up

5835.9 --> 5841.54
detected somehow right that sort of

5838.239 --> 5844.0599999999995
thing unusual things that's like because

5841.54 --> 5846.639
especially when they use it as weapons

5844.06 --> 5849.04
of war which is by the way extremely

5846.639 --> 5851.86
illegal officially

5849.04 --> 5855.699
they could use that that doesn't mean

5851.86 --> 5858.339999999999
they're constantly just like oh I got a

5855.699 --> 5861.159
weather weapon I'm just gonna shoot at

5858.34 --> 5864.88
every [Â __Â ] thing I can just because I

5861.159 --> 5868.199
can yeah that's not how it works

5864.88 --> 5868.1990000000005
they don't do that

5869.38 --> 5875.400000000001
okay it's ridiculous to think like that

5872.199 --> 5879.699
Nobody Does that ever

5875.4 --> 5881.159
if they're gonna use it as a weapon of

5879.699 --> 5884.199
War

5881.159 --> 5888.159
weaponized weather manipulation then

5884.199 --> 5892.78
there should be signs it has been picked

5888.159 --> 5895.599999999999
up in the past now learn from that and

5892.78 --> 5899.44
look for the signs if you don't have any

5895.6 --> 5902.1990000000005
signs shut the [Â __Â ] up and don't make a

5899.44 --> 5904.78
terrible situation worse

5902.199 --> 5906.339999999999
right it's already demoralizing for all

5904.78 --> 5908.32
these people out there

5906.34 --> 5911.56
that they have to typically go through

5908.32 --> 5913.84
this on a yearly basis almost

5911.56 --> 5916.3
and then to say it's being done on per

5913.84 --> 5919.179
that's literally just trying to rub salt

5916.3 --> 5922.2390000000005
in the wound do you even realize that

5919.179 --> 5924.9400000000005
that's what you're doing

5922.239 --> 5931.5599999999995
when you invoke that [Â __Â ]

5924.94 --> 5935.62
don't do that unless you have leads

5931.56 --> 5938.9800000000005
actual leads something to point at look

5935.62 --> 5941.139
at this this is a sign of potential

5938.98 --> 5943.138999999999
weather manipulation

5941.139 --> 5947.1990000000005
and that doesn't mean

5943.139 --> 5949.6
some thing that was written on paper in

5947.199 --> 5950.86
general about weather manipulation years

5949.6 --> 5956.1990000000005
ago

5950.86 --> 5957.5199999999995
means in the field detected anomalies

5956.199 --> 5960.719
that's what that means

5957.52 --> 5960.719
[Music]

5961.84 --> 5967.12
I'm preaching to the choir I have no

5964.42 --> 5968.08
doubt about it but it just it needs to

5967.12 --> 5970.739
be said

5968.08 --> 5970.739
I believe

5971.37 --> 5979.5289999999995
[Music]

5980.62 --> 5986.5
it's almost all contrails yeah except

5983.92 --> 5989.02
when it absolutely isn't

5986.5 --> 5990.46
yeah contrails

5989.02 --> 5993.400000000001
don't

5990.46 --> 5998.32
hang around for minutes and then start

5993.4 --> 6002.82
to wave out like a a sand dune shape

5998.32 --> 6007.32
yeah yeah water vapor

6002.82 --> 6008.82
even when condensed doesn't do that

6007.32 --> 6011.5199999999995
cat

6008.82 --> 6015.659
there's only one thing that can actually

6011.52 --> 6016.7390000000005
form the feathery Dune surface-like

6015.659 --> 6020.5199999999995
shape

6016.739 --> 6022.739
yeah the wind feather left behind

6020.52 --> 6026.400000000001
that's gonna turn into yeah that's

6022.739 --> 6028.08
called physical particles

6026.4 --> 6032.4
physical

6028.08 --> 6035.88
not liquid not gas physical particles

6032.4 --> 6039.44
dust of some kind that's the only thing

6035.88 --> 6039.4400000000005
that can leave that pattern

6041.58 --> 6045.78
and that happens

6043.739 --> 6048.259999999999
regularly

6045.78 --> 6051.3
even in this

6048.26 --> 6053.04
benign form of weather manipulation I'm

6051.3 --> 6055.26
assuming right now

6053.04 --> 6058.82
that happens

6055.26 --> 6058.820000000001
that's not moist

6058.92 --> 6064.8
okay

6061.08 --> 6068.78
that's particles that's physical solid

6064.8 --> 6068.78
particles that do that

6070.44 --> 6077.36
yeah and they're not ice crystals either

6074.04 --> 6077.36
because they don't do that either

6084.8 --> 6091.9800000000005
right yeah cool that's nice cool Moon

6088.98 --> 6093.959999999999
logic but again yeah directed energy

6091.98 --> 6096.178999999999
leaves

6093.96 --> 6100.9800000000005
a Trace

6096.179 --> 6105.08
you pick that up it's detected it shows

6100.98 --> 6105.08
an anomaly so again

6105.9 --> 6112.259999999999
directed energy weather manipulation

6108.54 --> 6114.42
cool where's the anomaly

6112.26 --> 6118.92
where's the sign that it is actually

6114.42 --> 6123.179
being done show it in that moment

6118.92 --> 6125.88
not some paper from 10 years ago show it

6123.179 --> 6128.58
in that moment show that it was detected

6125.88 --> 6131.52
show the proof

6128.58 --> 6134.84
don't just blabber on and spread fear

6131.52 --> 6134.84
about what could be

6141.42 --> 6147.08
gonna take two minute break

6144.119 --> 6147.08

6251.159 --> 6256.46
it's been interesting

6254.219 --> 6261.2390000000005
maybe I should put

6256.46 --> 6263.42
weather manipulation in the title as

uh okay let's see

6335.28 --> 6339.679
yeah I think that that'll work

6346.679 --> 6352.32
right so yeah

6349.8 --> 6355.5
still got time to catch up

6352.32 --> 6358.199
start a little late so I can keep going

6355.5 --> 6360.239
all depends on you guys or if you've

6358.199 --> 6363.0199999999995
already like had enough

6365.82 --> 6371.84

6410.76 --> 6414.08
a bit fluffy

6418.58 --> 6422.5
[Music]

6437.82 --> 6445.58
why does the title statement intent my

6442.02 --> 6445.580000000001
government owning the weather

6449.06 --> 6455.400000000001
I don't know gaining wisdom but I do

6452.699 --> 6458.96
know that

6455.4 --> 6461.46
that why they originally inserted like

6458.96 --> 6463.199
geoengineering in globalism in the first

6461.46 --> 6465.179
place is because they wanted to

6463.199 --> 6468.599999999999
Blackmail everybody

6465.179 --> 6470.82
it's like you do what we want or we'll

6468.6 --> 6472.26
give you [Â __Â ] weather and ruin your

6470.82 --> 6475.46
crops Etc

6472.26 --> 6475.46
not even joking

6476.82 --> 6481.34
that's what they mean with owning the

6479.159 --> 6481.339999999999
weather

6486.06 --> 6493.88
now whether they can actually succeed in

6489.48 --> 6493.879999999999
getting to that point is another matter

6493.92 --> 6498.38
but they sure as hell wanted that

6500.76 --> 6504.38
soft weather water

6507.0 --> 6509.84
I don't know

6510.179 --> 6516.86
it depends for region steamy traveler

6512.699 --> 6516.86
it's not uniform water

6518.4 --> 6523.92
I mean some places it is pretty hard

6521.04 --> 6527.6
water I think over here in Utrecht it's

6523.92 --> 6527.6
actually really good quality water

6527.699 --> 6534.78
there is like uh

6531.719 --> 6537.92
there is still minerals in there it's

6534.78 --> 6537.92
just not excessive

6550.26 --> 6556.679
sounds like blackmail yeah no [Â __Â ] it is

6553.739 --> 6558.959999999999
that's what fearlessm is it's like you

6556.679 --> 6562.1990000000005
do what we want no matter what is even

6558.96 --> 6564.42
if it's just to embarrass you or I will

6562.199 --> 6567.48
literally turn off

6564.42 --> 6570.6
your ability to survive

6567.48 --> 6572.459999999999
that's what feudalism is and that's what

6570.6 --> 6575.46
they want to do

6572.46 --> 6578.04
in Neo feudalism

6575.46 --> 6579.4800000000005
it's all blackmail

6578.04 --> 6582.42
all of it

6579.48 --> 6585.9
that's how it works

6582.42 --> 6589.68
do what we want you to do or we will

6585.9 --> 6594.5199999999995

now clutch your steamy traveler is just

6676.56 --> 6681.9800000000005
is just

6678.239 --> 6681.98
curious about random things

6682.02 --> 6689.219
I mean he asks questions I do appreciate

6685.56 --> 6691.679
it I have that ability too but I usually

6689.219 --> 6695.06
tend to just do something different when

6691.679 --> 6695.06
I'm in other people's chance

6699.48 --> 6703.459999999999
I tend to get kind of overwhelmed with

6701.88 --> 6707.639
input

6703.46 --> 6710.88
when I'm in somebody else's chat

6707.639 --> 6713.219
and it works almost better than if I'm

6710.88 --> 6715.38
like verbally a part of the show

6713.219 --> 6717.36
because then I talk a lot less but if I

6715.38 --> 6720.3
stick to chat then I can just go full

6717.36 --> 6724.88

[Music]

6736.679 --> 6740.88
I might have some inside yeah clutch

6738.78 --> 6744.96
well what you could do

6740.88 --> 6748.34
what might be a solution to like make

6744.96 --> 6750.78
your water less hard is by using well

6748.34 --> 6756.6
Gravity fat filters

6750.78 --> 6759.179
right tanks with ceramics that literally

6756.6 --> 6762.96
filter the water I mean

6759.179 --> 6765.54
that will like hold all the the hard

6762.96 --> 6766.44
minerals and all that it will filter it

6765.54 --> 6770.5199999999995
out

6766.44 --> 6773.219
makes like for really nice clean water

6770.52 --> 6776.179
like much better than like

6773.219 --> 6776.179
what is it

6776.719 --> 6782.52
much better than distilling it I mean

6779.94 --> 6787.339999999999
much much better

6782.52 --> 6787.34
it's delicious it's like

6788.42 --> 6793.4400000000005
ceramic filtered water the water that I

6791.46 --> 6796.26
use and my filters are really kind of

6793.44 --> 6798.719
dirty and all and it's still great and I

6796.26 --> 6801.780000000001
really want new ones actually because

6798.719 --> 6804.36
at first when I use that it's like magic

6801.78 --> 6807.9
water that comes out of there a fresh

6804.36 --> 6810.5599999999995
filters is so incredibly delicious it's

6807.9 --> 6810.5599999999995
like magic

6815.58 --> 6821.58
I mean that literally tastes like what

6818.219 --> 6824.82
you imagined like

6821.58 --> 6826.98
like one of those beautiful idyllic what

6824.82 --> 6829.619
little waterfalls

6826.98 --> 6832.099999999999
out of a glacier on a mountain would

6829.619 --> 6832.099999999999
taste like

6833.159 --> 6837.239
like it's sweet

6835.199 --> 6839.54
and just has this electric thing about

6837.239 --> 6839.54
it

6840.6 --> 6851.2390000000005
and it doesn't like decalcify you

6843.45 --> 6853.5
[Music]

6851.239 --> 6856.739
so that's what I use

6853.5 --> 6859.8
like a Berkey system

6856.739 --> 6862.5599999999995
with ceramic filters

6859.8 --> 6866.159000000001
those are days they can be kind of

6862.56 --> 6868.1990000000005
expensive but they last very long

6866.159 --> 6869.82
as long as you don't just throw mud

6868.199 --> 6871.86
water in there

6869.82 --> 6874.619
I just use it for tap water and then it

6871.86 --> 6877.619
lasts incredibly long

6874.619 --> 6877.619
foreign

6878.54 --> 6883.98
well there is so that in there sort of

6881.82 --> 6886.139
as well

6883.98 --> 6888.5599999999995
it's like pretty sophisticated filters

6886.139 --> 6888.56
out there

6906.199 --> 6910.04
okay steamy traffic

6913.92 --> 6916.58

6919.679 --> 6923.3
hey slamon buggy

6923.9 --> 6929.5199999999995
yeah dude

6926.94 --> 6931.32
I've been using one since

6929.52 --> 6934.219
2000

6931.32 --> 6934.219
and seven

6935.28 --> 6939.0199999999995
it's like the best thing ever

6939.179 --> 6945.4400000000005
no

6940.139 --> 6945.4400000000005
about seven no no 2008 ah close enough

6949.55 --> 6952.85
[Music]

6957.6 --> 6963.1990000000005
but I have already like replaced the

6960.78 --> 6963.199
filters

6966.179 --> 6971.88
and yeah I kind of think I need to kind

6969.48 --> 6974.04
of get new filters at some point I could

6971.88 --> 6977.400000000001
probably do with this like another five

6974.04 --> 6981.619
years or so maybe even longer but it

6977.4 --> 6984.54
just like slowly starts to degrade

6981.619 --> 6987.0599999999995
I mean it filters out most of the crap

6984.54 --> 6989.219
still but it's just I think it's also

6987.06 --> 6990.900000000001
like eventually like algae getting there

6989.219 --> 6993.619
or something

6990.9 --> 6993.619
I don't know

this is also that filtered water

7005.36 --> 7008.32
and it is soft

7008.99 --> 7012.17
[Music]

7020.9 --> 7026.659
I know steamy traveler so yeah please

7023.78 --> 7028.94
donate to my PayPal

7026.659 --> 7032.299999999999
because

7028.94 --> 7035.48
I would need four new filters and I'm

7032.3 --> 7041.1990000000005
pretty sure that they're like

7035.48 --> 7041.199
in between 50 and 100 euros each

7045.199 --> 7049.58
I haven't looked it up for a while

7047.239 --> 7052.94
so yeah it's kind of expensive to

7049.58 --> 7056.38
replace that I would love to do it

7052.94 --> 7056.379999999999
I also love to eat

7056.54 --> 7062.0
so yeah OVA Paul keeps uh posting my

7059.9 --> 7064.94
PayPal link but yeah

7062.0 --> 7068.56
I would love that I just can't afford it

7064.94 --> 7068.5599999999995
at all not even close

7071.48 --> 7077.299999999999
if anybody insists that I get new water

7073.94 --> 7079.159
filters then please donate like

7077.3 --> 7081.8
well

7079.159 --> 7085.239
200 Euros

7081.8 --> 7085.2390000000005
that would probably do it

7107.119 --> 7113.36
wow really okay Paul

7110.54 --> 7115.659
man that then your water is like really

7113.36 --> 7115.659
hard

7117.32 --> 7124.36
but if it's that hard then I would just

7120.44 --> 7124.36
like sand filter it first

7127.82 --> 7135.709
wouldn't that help

7128.76 --> 7135.709
[Music]

7141.34 --> 7146.3
I mean sand is very easy to replace

7144.44 --> 7150.08
right

7146.3 --> 7153.619000000001
so it's just like I have a

7150.08 --> 7155.84
a bucket with sand in it and a hole in

7153.619 --> 7157.94
the bottom and another bucket below it

7155.84 --> 7160.46
and then you dump the water in the

7157.94 --> 7165.339999999999
bucket with the sand

7160.46 --> 7165.34
that should get some of the hardness out

7181.04 --> 7186.08
what

7183.28 --> 7188.179
reactivated charcoal filters you need to

7186.08 --> 7191.0199999999995
put them in the oven

7188.179 --> 7191.02
what

7209.84 --> 7212.56
