start doing yeah more Members Only

75.06 --> 82.369
streams on the side I don't know why

77.25 --> 87.72
it's just maybe since the weather change

82.369 --> 90.929
my journal well this night I was I know

87.72 --> 95.55
this morning I went to bed really early

90.929 --> 98.31
and still like I kept on like waking up

95.55 --> 100.429
sweating and [ __ ] so maybe that's a good

98.31 --> 104.819
sign because I don't really feel my jaw

100.429 --> 106.44
anymore so maybe that's now over that's

104.819 --> 111.63
actually a good thing let's hope it

106.44 --> 114.509
stops now the nonsense yeah despite that

111.63 --> 117.69
though yeah the weather is still kind of

114.509 --> 120.5
the same as yesterday maybe slightly

117.69 --> 120.5
less rainy

123.08 --> 131.46
but big clouds and yeah rain does come

128.369 --> 138.96
out of there at times it's constantly

131.46 --> 142.23000000000002
blowing it's weird because yeah the wind

138.96 --> 144.9
cools you off significantly but when

142.23 --> 147.48
you're not in the wind it turns out that

144.9 --> 151.71
it's actually quite warm because of the

147.48 --> 154.89
moist or something so I was basically no

151.71 --> 157.17000000000002
my bike and it's pretty chill then I

154.89 --> 160.52999999999997
stand still in the store and suddenly

157.17 --> 164.08999999999997
like I get completely overheated it's

160.53 --> 170.34
weird these weather conditions yeah

164.09 --> 175.11
anyway I got green tea with me and some

170.34 --> 176.76
blueberries and yeah some grapefruit

175.11 --> 178.34
juice I don't know if I'm gonna take

176.76 --> 181.499
that yeah

178.34 --> 181.499

I think I was on a hangout with sleeping

243.31 --> 252.55
warrior somewhere what's that the day

246.82 --> 255.82
before I'm not sure now it was basically

290.4 --> 294.96

293.14 --> 297.58
to Flat Earth Oh God

294.96 --> 304.15
you were dual streaming or something

297.58 --> 308.72999999999996
weren't you and he was just being

304.15 --> 308.72999999999996

310.21 --> 313.33
[Music]

313.83 --> 322.57
hey yo che oh by the way good servant I

319.18 --> 325.75
watched your upload this morning while

322.57 --> 331.06
you saw me commenting probably it was

325.75 --> 333.97
pretty interesting oh and right before

331.06 --> 336.33
this show started I was watching on D

333.97 --> 336.33000000000004
life

336.7 --> 344.26
Nathan's Dalton from lift avail again he

340.39 --> 348.15999999999997
was doing the other show again with John

344.26 --> 352.96
McAfee but he had some sound issues but

348.16 --> 354.27000000000004
it was still yeah interesting to see

352.96 --> 357.459
that

354.27 --> 357.459
[Music]

363.13 --> 368.76
yeah good 7 it was a pretty interesting

366.28 --> 368.76
talk

371.95 --> 378.7
I'd love to continue our religious

375.85 --> 381.40000000000003
discussion some more now it is something

378.7 --> 384.72999999999996
that I'm you're actively trying to

381.4 --> 387.46
figure things out I have been for a

384.73 --> 390.40000000000003
while from the way that I think's dude

387.46 --> 393.75
just never really got any connection

390.4 --> 396.13
properly with others just looking in

393.75 --> 402.51
because I always feel like I need to be

396.13 --> 402.51
on my toes although unless these days

411.42 --> 427.86
well okay Missouri bear oh that's some

415.59 --> 429.34999999999997
project well if anyone courts do such a

427.86 --> 432.15000000000003
thing

429.35 --> 434.78000000000003
seemingly from out of nowhere yeah then

432.15 --> 437.78
it would be own Benjamin probably

434.78 --> 437.78
interesting

451.719 --> 459.939
yeah also looking around at the at my

455.489 --> 464.12899999999996
alternative Dutch news site that I'd

459.939 --> 464.129
typically fallout 9 for knows it's

466.919 --> 472.959
there's just a lot of criticism going

469.779 --> 477.279
around um on their current Parliament

472.959 --> 479.589
and it's good to follow some of it as I

477.279 --> 482.729
still feel an outsider in knowledge wise

479.589 --> 487.059
like I don't really know what's going on

482.729 --> 490.089
cuz I got a rough feel for it but it's

487.059 --> 492.189
always such a hassle Dutch politics it's

490.089 --> 494.829
unbelievable

492.189 --> 496.869
I don't know how they manage it how they

494.829 --> 503.289
manage to stay focused on that [ __ ]

496.869 --> 508.019
constantly it's just ah but there seems

503.289 --> 508.019
to be just a lot of criticism in general

524.13 --> 530.17
yeah and I watched the Dutch news too

527.199 --> 536.62
sometimes for the more societal issues

530.17 --> 540.699
as well yeah I'm gonna have to like re

536.62 --> 543.79
figure it out cuz the ass when I look

540.699 --> 546.93
into it like what is happening maybe

543.79 --> 550.269
it's the way that the the Dutch news

546.93 --> 553.3599999999999
system presents it that it's just like a

550.269 --> 556.48
weird story that's not really reflecting

553.36 --> 558.339
anything about reality but kind of like

556.48 --> 561.88
puts things out of context I don't know

558.339 --> 567.12
they are like fake news considered like

561.88 --> 573.24
that in many ways but yeah it's just

567.12 --> 573.24
anyway I'm not really too focused on it

581.1 --> 591.02
right but supposedly today is

586.52 --> 593.76
remembering the Dutch slavery past

591.02 --> 598.71
there's like a remembrance for that now

593.76 --> 602.64
going on apparently or it was just a few

598.71 --> 607.14
hours ago and supposedly the corona

602.64 --> 610.9499999999999
situation has sort of been scaled back a

607.14 --> 614.61
little again and now these restaurants

610.95 --> 618.0600000000001
made open and stuff and this and that

614.61 --> 623.4300000000001
may open sports halls and it's like yay

618.06 --> 625.43
we are allowed to do that again but

623.43 --> 628.77
still be careful

625.43 --> 630.87
there's just no logical context really

628.77 --> 632.5799999999999
put through the entire corona supposed

630.87 --> 638.12
to the corona involvement with it at all

632.58 --> 638.12
it's just a sliding game it's just

639.26 --> 643.35
but anything yeah in the Netherlands

641.97 --> 645.99
everything's supposed to be opening

643.35 --> 654.99
again and no goodie well sure you know

645.99 --> 658.53
can't object to that yeah I know a

654.99 --> 660.9300000000001
second wave blood like who's gonna do

658.53 --> 663.47
that at this point what's the second way

660.93 --> 663.4699999999999
of gonna mean

676.19 --> 681.3190000000001
anyway I don't even want to know what it

679.009 --> 683.839
supposed Li means it's just nonsense or

681.319 --> 686.269
it's just like a there's a weather

683.839 --> 688.85
situation coming in the near future and

686.269 --> 691.55
we know that is definitely going to

688.85 --> 694.66
trigger a lot of people to get sudden

691.55 --> 698.689
Colts you know like it happens sometimes

694.66 --> 700.49
extreme weather change well then maybe

698.689 --> 702.829
it's based on that and they're just like

700.49 --> 705.7090000000001
hoping that people fall for it or

702.829 --> 709.39
something it's not I don't know I don't

705.709 --> 712.5189999999999
know why they think it could work

709.39 --> 712.519
[Music]

721.69 --> 726.23
anyway I appreciate having you around

723.95 --> 731.33
Rosie it's good to have somebody to

726.23 --> 734.66
reflect upon on Dutch situations cuz

731.33 --> 736.4000000000001
yeah there's not a lot of people that

734.66 --> 747.0799999999999
really know what's going on here you

736.4 --> 751.63
know except that their media tends to

747.08 --> 751.63
really suck up to liberals so

756.42 --> 763.3499999999999
ah right oh okay it's it's even weirder

761.19 --> 766.5600000000001
you know now through just picking up on

763.35 --> 768.48
corona blah blah situations and there's

766.56 --> 770.579
a lot of it going around okay just

768.48 --> 772.47
everybody's constantly blabbering on

770.579 --> 780.06
about it don't know where they're

772.47 --> 783.44
getting all the info but right it's now

780.06 --> 787.579
suggested even that basically the tests

783.44 --> 793.6800000000001
coming from China were specifically

787.579 --> 795.3599999999999
causing it or something I don't know if

793.68 --> 798.899
there's even any kind of legitimate

795.36 --> 802.5
legitimacy to that you know like this

798.899 --> 807.3
whole idea that people are getting it is

802.5 --> 809.07
still kind of like at one step too far

807.3 --> 812.04
for me because I really don't believe

809.07 --> 816.75
there's anything real but then maybe I

812.04 --> 822.39
don't know a just a flu spreading or

816.75 --> 826.41
even a basic one and how does that work

822.39 --> 829.98
what is it exactly I don't know but it's

826.41 --> 833.579
not something to close down society for

829.98 --> 836.6700000000001
at all like not even close it's like

833.579 --> 839.959
that one suggestion is the most

836.67 --> 839.959
ridiculous part of it all

845.11 --> 848.22
[Music]

851.89 --> 858.18
right oh yeah yeah I know that that's

855.82 --> 861.7
what's been going around before and

858.18 --> 864.37
already been kind of figured out from

861.7 --> 867.399
many angles that the tests are give a

864.37 --> 870.4590000000001
lot of false positives and that yeah

867.399 --> 873.19
that majority may have be false

870.459 --> 876.9399999999999
positives and they just take it as as if

873.19 --> 879.97
it is real anyway so yeah there's all

876.94 --> 883.3290000000001
kinds of statistical nonsense and fraud

879.97 --> 883.9300000000001
basic fraud it is fraudulent statistical

883.329 --> 886.51
fraud

883.93 --> 889.12
well basically holding back on a

886.51 --> 892.06
technicality maybe but technically these

889.12 --> 897.839
the data is being falsely interpreted on

892.06 --> 897.8389999999999
purpose and that kind of makes it fraud

899.64 --> 904.019
so yeah in the numbers game

907.34 --> 910.84
anyway enough about that

924.32 --> 929.0790000000001
all right yeah mark color

932.09 --> 936.76
yeah that's exactly what I was talking

933.98 --> 936.76
about anyway

956.86 --> 960.009
[Music]

975.14 --> 985.069
[Music]

977.479 --> 985.0690000000001
don't be here for go out of yeah

1006.499 --> 1015.36
hmm

1008.59 --> 1015.36
yeah hang in there mark colored that's a

1018.9 --> 1029.06
that's a tough situation a bit right

1027.699 --> 1032.1190000000001
yeah I don't know what it is

1029.06 --> 1032.119
[Music]

1038.37 --> 1047.86
where's the berries or something I don't

1040.93 --> 1049.71
know I think there might be some fungi

1047.86 --> 1054.12
here and there that I've overlooked

1049.71 --> 1054.1200000000001
maybe that's why I'm feeling so weird

1056.4 --> 1062.01
another them hallucinating or anything

1058.99 --> 1065.47
with it just feels like that typical

1062.01 --> 1067.78
stomach slight slight crappiness that

1065.47 --> 1070.21
just indicates there's a specific line

1067.78 --> 1074.1399999999999
of toxins typically associated with

1070.21 --> 1080.38
certain fungi I don't know maybe that's

1074.14 --> 1083.8000000000002
it okay maybe I'm just not gonna eat

1080.38 --> 1084.73
these berries for a while and just try

1083.8 --> 1092.76
again later

1084.73 --> 1092.76
oh yeah yeah Missouri bear Thunderfoot

1093.6 --> 1096.7099999999998
[Music]

1113.23 --> 1120.05
thoughts on cancer being caused by fungi

1116.36 --> 1125.6599999999999
well direct calls could potentially be

1120.05 --> 1130.07
proven it but I would rather see it as

1125.66 --> 1132.14
that it is related so for example if

1130.07 --> 1136.58
when you have a lot of sugar in you then

1132.14 --> 1141.68
the candida fungi typically starts to

1136.58 --> 1146.03
nestle like spread around gradually and

1141.68 --> 1155.69
that may directly cause certain type of

1146.03 --> 1157.61
cancers to basically take grip but yeah

1155.69 --> 1161.54
you know when you approach it from the

1157.61 --> 1164.33
German new medicine like it then it

1161.54 --> 1166.61
would require a what is it a

1164.33 --> 1169.9099999999999
predisposition not genetically or

1166.61 --> 1173.33
anything but psychologically in order

1169.91 --> 1176.3600000000001
for an actual yeah almost

1173.33 --> 1180.1399999999999
seriously inflamed cancer situation to

1176.36 --> 1182.6
even appear in the first place and then

1180.14 --> 1185.24
if you wouldn't have to get this is this

1182.6 --> 1186.86
is just conceptual okay I'm just trying

1185.24 --> 1192.89
to put it together you know this is how

1186.86 --> 1196.3999999999999
I deal with it for myself but yeah if

1192.89 --> 1199.0700000000002
you wouldn't have the Candida in you a

1196.4 --> 1201.26
lot and you would still have the

1199.07 --> 1205.01
psychological backlash then you might

1201.26 --> 1207.44
still and experience inflammation and

1205.01 --> 1211.58
you might even still think it is cancer

1207.44 --> 1213.47
but it would probably just yeah and

1211.58 --> 1215.12
after a certain point and then

1213.47 --> 1217.88
everything restores back to normal and

1215.12 --> 1220.85
that is these types of things I tend to

1217.88 --> 1225.2
experience well in the last few years

1220.85 --> 1227.6599999999999
I've experienced it regularly and it

1225.2 --> 1230.9
seems all like it's backlashes from just

1227.66 --> 1232.88
crazy situations in the past which is

1230.9 --> 1235.69
basically what the German new medicine

1232.88 --> 1235.69
says

1235.72 --> 1242.2
you can coordinate the positions in your

1239.21 --> 1247.299
body where such a inflammation sudden

1242.2 --> 1251.059
inflammation happens with very specific

1247.299 --> 1261.95
effects psychological effect it's it's

1251.059 --> 1268.22
fascinating there's a lot to it only

1261.95 --> 1269.809
just for the the typical locations if

1268.22 --> 1271.669
