uh whether today is

115.84 --> 119.28
kind of the same as yesterday

120.24 --> 127.67999999999999
sunny but it is still moist

123.92 --> 130.56
not too much wind so it got it

127.68 --> 132.72
today's got a bit of a tropical feel to

130.56 --> 132.72
it

139.52 --> 144.56
like the birds are also like hanging in

141.599 --> 144.56
the shadows and

150.64 --> 157.83999999999997
but i'm pretty sure that the plants are

152.56 --> 157.84
all enjoying this a lot

160.239 --> 165.36
and i've been looking around for balcony

163.599 --> 169.35999999999999
plant pots

165.36 --> 171.76000000000002
online just to get an idea of what i

169.36 --> 174.08
could potentially find out there when i

171.76 --> 176.48
go physically

174.08 --> 176.48000000000002
shopping

177.12 --> 183.36
right hello

180.64 --> 184.159
cleary first in chat stone monkey 3d

183.36 --> 187.44000000000003
nathan r

184.159 --> 190.56
slo-mo moon buggy clutch bear wow

187.44 --> 193.44
a lot of people awesome

190.56 --> 193.44
good to see you all

194.319 --> 202.07999999999998
it is sunday the 11th

197.36 --> 202.08
of july 2021

202.48 --> 207.11999999999998
and i got a our show for you today at

210.84 --> 213.84
least

215.84 --> 222.4
so yeah a bit of bummer but

218.879 --> 227.84
no ball busters yesterday apparently

222.4 --> 227.84
kiwi's computer is still broken

229.92 --> 235.439
and it was really a shame because i was

231.76 --> 235.439
really looking forward to it

237.2 --> 244.959
but oh well uh instead i just

241.04 --> 244.959
hung around over it marc litkis

246.0 --> 251.84
dude he had like this insane

249.2 --> 253.35999999999999
marathon what was i'm not sure i didn't

251.84 --> 254.879
count it but i think

253.36 --> 258.56
roughly putting it together it must have

254.879 --> 260.4
been like five hours or something

258.56 --> 262.079
if that's even possible it should be

260.4 --> 268.32
possible i'm not sure otherwise it's

262.079 --> 270.479
gonna be four it was incredibly long

268.32 --> 272.71999999999997
and it was with the russian vids on

270.479 --> 272.71999999999997
there

273.12 --> 277.52
now i have a little bit of mixed

274.32 --> 280.15999999999997
feelings about that guy

277.52 --> 282.0
because of where he typically draws

280.16 --> 285.36
people's minds towards

282.0 --> 288.88
and he's done that since the start

285.36 --> 291.91900000000004
and i don't like how he

288.88 --> 293.28
railroads thinking in a way and i think

291.919 --> 295.68
that it's purely him

293.28 --> 296.479
like he is not doing that on purpose

295.68 --> 299.12
that's just

296.479 --> 299.12
how he is

299.919 --> 305.59999999999997
so yeah some things he has to say and he

302.96 --> 308.84
has a lot of experience out there

305.6 --> 310.24
been doing this for a while is

308.84 --> 313.28
interesting

310.24 --> 313.919
but yeah i at some point i just stopped

313.28 --> 316.4
watching

313.919 --> 317.039
because he was kind of driving me

316.4 --> 320.479
towards

317.039 --> 325.039
paranoia and savonier thingies

320.479 --> 328.479
and i don't want that uh

325.039 --> 330.56
so i then just watched flat earth debate

328.479 --> 333.199
premiere from

330.56 --> 335.68
uh from thursday which was a really

333.199 --> 337.68
entertaining one

335.68 --> 340.16
and then i got back to martin and he was

337.68 --> 340.8
still alive with russian bits it kept on

340.16 --> 343.84000000000003
going

340.8 --> 347.6
it's incredibly long

343.84 --> 351.35999999999996
yeah what does rv do

347.6 --> 353.84000000000003
uh he does conspiracy videos including

351.36 --> 353.84000000000003
flat earth

355.12 --> 359.759
but he's someone that's like really

357.84 --> 363.28
dwelling on gematria

359.759 --> 367.039
and like satanic virtue

363.28 --> 369.52
signaling in movies and music videos

367.039 --> 371.28
like he hangs around that he always

369.52 --> 374.08
brings that back in

371.28 --> 376.31899999999996
but i guess that's quite common out

374.08 --> 376.31899999999996
there

377.68 --> 381.36
but i remember him mostly because he he

380.8 --> 385.6
first

381.36 --> 388.639
showed up on my radar as the one that

385.6 --> 391.759
brought the

388.639 --> 393.84000000000003
no trees on flat earth is how it was

391.759 --> 395.84000000000003
renamed it's just like the giant trees

393.84 --> 398.31899999999996
videos

395.84 --> 400.479
it was kind of the first one for me to

398.319 --> 403.91900000000004
bump that onto the scene

400.479 --> 403.919
and that's how i got to know him

405.28 --> 414.31899999999996
and that's like way from way ago 2015

410.56 --> 416.8
or 16 i don't know either way

414.319 --> 423.84000000000003
yeah that was a really long show flatter

416.8 --> 423.84000000000003
day night show

425.36 --> 427.68
right

431.759 --> 438.24
it seems like home benjamin is

435.039 --> 442.639
not doing weekend streams now

438.24 --> 446.24
and he's just selling at his new system

442.639 --> 447.52
so it's a bit vacated in the weekend

446.24 --> 451.84000000000003
like that

447.52 --> 451.84
for me

451.919 --> 457.84
online that is right anyway hello good

583.92 --> 591.8389999999999
he sees machines and things okay

596.56 --> 603.5999999999999

600.16 --> 608.24
that i remember that's from long ago

603.6 --> 611.9200000000001
probably not him way before flat earth

608.24 --> 615.6800000000001

moon and mars basis and

615.68 --> 620.079
look at the tubes look at the tubes

617.68 --> 622.2399999999999

620.079 --> 626.0
suggesting a

622.24 --> 628.399
ancient forgotten high-tech civilization

626.0 --> 631.76
or a previous colony

628.399 --> 635.04
right that sort of video i remember that

631.76 --> 635.04
but that's from where you go

643.519 --> 648.9590000000001
from way back i mean let's keep it

646.56 --> 648.959

hit with

796.8 --> 801.8389999999999
deep inside the rabbit hole channel

so

843.44 --> 848.399
it's cold it's all fake on yeah okay

845.76 --> 852.079
well that seems a little uh

848.399 --> 852.079
solipsistic to me

854.24 --> 871.519
i mean i have seen gorillas in zoos

859.519 --> 885.839
they are not fake

871.519 --> 885.839
pandas however is another matter

896.88 --> 899.8389999999999

okay

946.88 --> 954.079
dude stone monkey 3d

950.079 --> 957.279
like just because people might have done

954.079 --> 959.7589999999999
that for different purposes

957.279 --> 961.4399999999999
doesn't mean that it's all fake that's

959.759 --> 969.839
ridiculous

961.44 --> 969.839
right animatronics

971.68 --> 977.68
like animatronics don't swim and dive in

975.12 --> 977.68
water and

986.72 --> 997.839
this is very very silly

1001.759 --> 1005.6
oh wow he says all that

1008.16 --> 1013.759
dude that guy's out of his [ __ ] mind

1010.24 --> 1018.32
then sound monkey 3d

1013.759 --> 1018.32
that that is that is [ __ ]

1022.839 --> 1025.839
nuts

1031.76 --> 1036.4
oh he's headed in the game oh so why do

1034.559 --> 1036.72
you think that is good servant could it

1036.4 --> 1039.679
be

1036.72 --> 1040.88
because he's [ __ ] insane and

1039.679 --> 1044.88
spreading

1040.88 --> 1046.0790000000002
insane ideas that absolutely are not

1044.88 --> 1048.3190000000002
true

1046.079 --> 1049.2
could that be a reason why he's not very

1048.319 --> 1053.12
beloved in

1049.2 --> 1057.6000000000001
the game why are you showing him love

1053.12 --> 1060.2399999999998
he's out of his mind obviously

1057.6 --> 1061.1999999999998
like i don't even need to watch it to

1060.24 --> 1067.84
know that from

1061.2 --> 1067.8400000000001
the data i'm getting here from you guys

1067.919 --> 1071.039
controversial yeah yeah controversial

1070.559 --> 1073.6
wrong

1071.039 --> 1075.36
it's what he says is wrong and it's

1073.6 --> 1078.0
insane

1075.36 --> 1078.3999999999999
yeah controversial yeah if you think

1078.0 --> 1080.96
that

1078.4 --> 1083.8400000000001
just complete idiocy and insanity is

1080.96 --> 1083.8400000000001
controversial

1084.08 --> 1086.48
god

1091.28 --> 1096.0
but he talks oh thanks well that's just

1094.24 --> 1099.28
great oh it's

1096.0 --> 1103.6
dude you know what that makes him

1099.28 --> 1106.0
potentially allegedly control opposition

1103.6 --> 1107.9189999999999
like oh look hey a guy that talks about

1106.0 --> 1108.88
flat earth oh he also talks about

uh wow is that a good thing

1116.32 --> 1118.96
good servant

1120.88 --> 1125.679
it's a bit of a lap of judgment there

1123.2 --> 1125.679
perhaps

1132.64 --> 1137.6000000000001
dubai says idiot [ __ ] too yeah i know

1135.44 --> 1142.0800000000002

1195.2 --> 1199.44
i mean it's not gonna help people wake

1197.919 --> 1201.44
up

1199.44 --> 1202.96
it's just gonna give them more excuses

1201.44 --> 1206.4
to say oh you see

1202.96 --> 1206.4
flat earthers are insane

1212.08 --> 1216.0
all right all right sorry if i'm

1214.0 --> 1221.84
overreacting a bit it's just

1216.0 --> 1221.84
that you said he was good god

1226.0 --> 1235.84
all right

1240.559 --> 1251.28
who comes up with that [ __ ]

1248.159 --> 1254.0800000000002
i mean before flat earth

1251.28 --> 1255.36
there was this guy called freeman and he

1254.08 --> 1257.6789999999999
had issues

1255.36 --> 1260.1589999999999
and that's literally before flatter and

1257.679 --> 1263.76
he said obama was like

1260.159 --> 1265.919
a clone of like one of these

1263.76 --> 1268.4
old egyptian kings because there was

1265.919 --> 1271.1200000000001
this statue of him that's just

1268.4 --> 1273.44
it really is remarkably similar to how

1271.12 --> 1276.559
obama looks

1273.44 --> 1281.039
freeman fly no i don't know he

1276.559 --> 1282.1589999999999
did this is literally like 2011 and 12

1281.039 --> 1283.679
and 10.

1282.159 --> 1285.3600000000001
i don't even know if the guy is still

1283.679 --> 1288.64
alive but yeah freeman

1285.36 --> 1291.12
oh wow nobody's gonna call themselves

1288.64 --> 1292.0800000000002
that right so it's not the freeman you

1291.12 --> 1294.1589999999999
know probably

1292.08 --> 1298.1589999999999
i haven't heard from him in a long long

1294.159 --> 1301.2800000000002
time i don't think he is on youtube

1298.159 --> 1303.5200000000002
but it was this guy like

1301.28 --> 1305.2
very conspiracy theorist and he knew

1303.52 --> 1306.0
that he was very honest about it like

1305.2 --> 1309.28
yeah i

1306.0 --> 1311.12
i do come up with weird ideas like weird

1309.28 --> 1313.36
connections so he was kind of open about

1311.12 --> 1313.36
that

1317.44 --> 1322.72
right so in the movie and he even

1320.88 --> 1324.24
talked about that himself like in the

1322.72 --> 1326.48
movie 2012

1324.24 --> 1328.4
remember if you remember maybe you don't

1326.48 --> 1331.6
care

1328.4 --> 1332.0800000000002
like at some point one of the groups of

1331.6 --> 1335.1999999999998
people

1332.08 --> 1338.24
in that movie that are lead

1335.2 --> 1338.24
went to what is it

1341.84 --> 1348.08
what's it called again where the

1344.48 --> 1351.52
supposed super volcano is

1348.08 --> 1354.96
yellowstone park and there was this

1351.52 --> 1359.2
kooky radio guy there in a big van

1354.96 --> 1362.24
or something that guy

1359.2 --> 1365.1200000000001
was like a perfect ambulation of what

1362.24 --> 1366.72
freeman was like like an ultimate

1365.12 --> 1369.9189999999999
conspiracy guy that is

1366.72 --> 1372.72
kooky but he is on to something right

1369.919 --> 1373.3600000000001
that character was perfectly inspired on

1372.72 --> 1377.3600000000001
him

1373.36 --> 1380.6399999999999
like perfectly and he even reviewed that

1377.36 --> 1384.24
at the time right so that's

1380.64 --> 1386.4
the guy i'm talking about now he made

1384.24 --> 1387.6
yeah that analogy like oh he's a clone

1386.4 --> 1390.3200000000002
from

1387.6 --> 1391.6789999999999
from an egyptian pharaoh or something

1390.32 --> 1395.039
and i was like

1391.679 --> 1398.96
okay well yeah that statue statue looks

1395.039 --> 1402.32
so incredibly alike i can't deny

1398.96 --> 1403.76
this the scaring the the freaky

1402.32 --> 1407.6789999999999
similarities

1403.76 --> 1410.799
right that's him still has a channel

1407.679 --> 1413.919
really holy [ __ ] i didn't even know that

1410.799 --> 1416.08
clutch bear he's called

1413.919 --> 1417.2
freeman fly dude can you link me up to

1416.08 --> 1420.08
that i haven't

1417.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
heard from him in a long long time this

1420.08 --> 1431.84
is all going by memory

1450.4 --> 1454.159
hello kristen my way but yeah clutch

1453.76 --> 1456.1589999999999
bear

1457.2 --> 1460.159
he was still out there

1470.84 --> 1473.84
wow

1477.679 --> 1487.8400000000001
anyway right

1488.32 --> 1493.6
yeah freeman was also like way onto ufos

1491.44 --> 1497.6000000000001
and aliens as demons like

1493.6 --> 1500.559
even back then that was a long time ago

1497.6 --> 1501.1999999999998
the russian fake video is worth watching

1500.559 --> 1504.72
if you get

1501.2 --> 1508.0
a chance what what russian fake feet

1504.72 --> 1510.72
what are you talking about rob h

1508.0 --> 1511.44
did you email them me that or something

1510.72 --> 1513.6000000000001
dude

1511.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
i could just give you a link man i i

1513.6 --> 1518.48
trust you and you've given me

1515.84 --> 1522.3999999999999
quite a couple of interesting emails so

1518.48 --> 1524.32
if you got something to drop in chat

1522.4 --> 1528.799

1524.32 --> 1533.6
deserved it

1528.799 --> 1536.799
freeman holy [ __ ] is that him

1533.6 --> 1536.799

1537.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
holy [ __ ] it's it's really him

1547.76 --> 1553.039
whoa dude

1550.799 --> 1556.4
he still has a shitty camera or this is

1553.039 --> 1560.96
like a re-print

1556.4 --> 1560.96
is that is he still doing live stuff

1564.159 --> 1568.0
last video here is one year ago

1568.84 --> 1571.84
but

1572.159 --> 1578.0800000000002
yeah i have to look through that

1575.76 --> 1578.96
where the esoteric meets the political

1578.08 --> 1585.84
right

1578.96 --> 1585.8400000000001
he was talking about esoterism a lot

1589.76 --> 1599.84
anyway thanks for that glitch bear

1604.72 --> 1607.6000000000001
posted above

1609.679 --> 1613.8400000000001

1725.44 --> 1730.559
find it but nothing popped on popped up

1732.48 --> 1739.84
the notifications so no last video

1807.039 --> 1810.1589999999999
when you're done watching maybe you

1808.72 --> 1812.559

making a joke

1915.76 --> 1921.84

russian space oh it's unlisted

1925.679 --> 1928.0

hey gary wubanga

1981.279 --> 1987.919
getting some more promotion from youtube

1984.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
nathan oakley i don't know

1987.919 --> 1991.8400000000001
i don't really think so

1992.399 --> 1996.399
i haven't noticed it really

2002.64 --> 2008.24
but on the other hand i think that maybe

2005.84 --> 2010.08
i think maybe the whole social media

2008.24 --> 2014.0
stuff

2010.08 --> 2018.24
the whole process all of it i think

2014.0 --> 2021.84
they've managed to maneuver

2018.24 --> 2021.84
almost everyone on it

2022.159 --> 2026.64
pretty much as much as they wanted to as

2024.64 --> 2027.76
they set out to i think that everybody's

2026.64 --> 2029.76
already

2027.76 --> 2030.8799999999999
it's already running exactly like they

2029.76 --> 2035.76
wanted they know

2030.88 --> 2035.7600000000002
don't even need to demote us any further

2043.76 --> 2047.84

i'll have you on

2053.599 --> 2062.56
on skype if you like

2060.96 --> 2064.879

2147.599 --> 2151.28
how's the weather over there good i'm

2150.0 --> 2152.4
just gonna close this window so i don't

2151.28 --> 2154.8
bust you out of wind noise

2152.4 --> 2154.8
hold on

2156.64 --> 2160.96
yeah good and i just couldn't type while

2159.04 --> 2162.4
i was doing the dishwasher so

2160.96 --> 2165.04
i just wanted to give you the examples

2162.4 --> 2168.48
as you asked so somebody sent me a

2165.04 --> 2171.359
photograph or screenshot of a

2168.48 --> 2173.119
are you enjoying youtube example with me

2171.359 --> 2175.52
in it specifically me in it

2173.119 --> 2177.52
and then someone else showed me um a

2175.52 --> 2180.88
screenshot of

2177.52 --> 2182.32
me on the top of a recommended list and

2180.88 --> 2184.1600000000003
there was a third one that i'm wrecking

2182.32 --> 2185.599
my brains for that i can't remember

2184.16 --> 2187.2
but i tend to only mention these things

2185.599 --> 2188.079
when i go about three examples the third

2187.2 --> 2190.56
one comes from me and

2188.079 --> 2191.92
karen where is it but as i said it's

2190.56 --> 2192.7999999999997
been several examples that people have

2191.92 --> 2195.04
sent to me of

2192.8 --> 2195.8390000000004
did you realize you're you're seeming to

2195.04 --> 2197.92
get

2195.839 --> 2200.32
promotion from youtube and i was like

2197.92 --> 2201.04
hmm yeah i had noticed certain things

2200.32 --> 2202.2400000000002
but uh

2201.04 --> 2204.4
you know really didn't pay them any

2202.24 --> 2206.0789999999997
never mind until you sent me this i'll

2204.4 --> 2207.6800000000003
i'll keep it the back of my mind when

2206.079 --> 2210.079
the first one came through and then

2207.68 --> 2211.2799999999997
obviously the second and then the third

2210.079 --> 2212.96
has made me think oh it's worth

2211.28 --> 2214.5600000000004
mentioning and asking now in hence when

2212.96 --> 2215.68
you asked has anybody got any questions

2214.56 --> 2217.2799999999997
i wanted to discuss

2215.68 --> 2220.3999999999996
have you noticed you getting any more

2217.28 --> 2220.4
promotion from youtube

2220.48 --> 2224.96
right right yeah i do remember i do

2222.96 --> 2227.839
remember you brought that up uh what is

2224.96 --> 2229.52
it a couple of weeks ago

2227.839 --> 2231.599
personally i haven't really noticed it

2229.52 --> 2234.0
too much you know

2231.599 --> 2236.079
sometimes people new people get in here

2234.0 --> 2237.28
in the chat besides trolls which get

2236.079 --> 2239.599
banned immediately

2237.28 --> 2241.76
and they usually tell me that they found

2239.599 --> 2244.88
me through your channel

2241.76 --> 2247.8390000000004
they recognized me or but

2244.88 --> 2248.96
other than that i and i always ask when

2247.839 --> 2250.56
i know somebody's new

2248.96 --> 2252.4
like okay where did you actually come

2250.56 --> 2254.4
from how did you bump into this

2252.4 --> 2256.32
i've never heard a single case where

2254.4 --> 2258.88
somebody had been

2256.32 --> 2259.599
see like oh yeah you just happened to

2258.88 --> 2262.2400000000002
pop up

2259.599 --> 2263.76
in my recommended list like i've never

2262.24 --> 2266.4799999999996
heard that

2263.76 --> 2267.8390000000004
unless they were already full well into

2266.48 --> 2271.359
the flat earth scene

2267.839 --> 2271.7599999999998
on youtube so i haven't noticed one bit

2271.359 --> 2274.56
of it

2271.76 --> 2276.6400000000003
maybe your channel did though i don't

2274.56 --> 2278.4
know maybe your channel does have like a

2276.64 --> 2282.0789999999997
special

2278.4 --> 2283.839
thing to it maybe it's the cycle

2282.079 --> 2285.6800000000003
the psychology that's constantly

2283.839 --> 2288.7999999999997
happening

2285.68 --> 2291.5989999999997
that just gives it a rank something an

2288.8 --> 2292.4
interest outside of flat earth or that i

2291.599 --> 2295.76
don't know

2292.4 --> 2298.079
not sure it could be it does

2295.76 --> 2300.4
certainly draw in a lot of attention but

2298.079 --> 2300.4
you do

2301.92 --> 2305.599
but you think about just being a numbers

2303.599 --> 2307.28
thing so basketball memberships were

2305.599 --> 2308.96
allowed for basically anybody with over

2307.28 --> 2309.599
a thousand subs there was a minimum

2308.96 --> 2312.56
break point

2309.599 --> 2314.2400000000002
i think it was something like 20 or 25

2312.56 --> 2316.64
000 subscribers

2314.24 --> 2318.0789999999997
and i vaguely remember a few youtubers

2316.64 --> 2320.96
when they got to about

2318.079 --> 2322.7200000000003
um 18 19 000 subscribers were saying

2320.96 --> 2323.44
it's really difficult to seem to push

2322.72 --> 2324.64
past it

2323.44 --> 2326.64
i've been stuck at this number for a

2324.64 --> 2328.4
long time and certainly i found it

2326.64 --> 2329.7599999999998
and when i was feeling or thinking or

2328.4 --> 2330.88
seeing the same things

2329.76 --> 2333.44
i thought i've got to do something

2330.88 --> 2334.8
proactively to push me over 20 000

2333.44 --> 2337.28
because i think it seems like a bit of a

2334.8 --> 2339.119
wall that people get stuck behind

2337.28 --> 2340.48
and it was only after getting you

2339.119 --> 2342.0
included lots of people to actually

2340.48 --> 2343.839
shout me out and increase the subs

2342.0 --> 2345.44
beyond that twenty thousand point that

2343.839 --> 2346.72
people started contacting me and saying

2345.44 --> 2347.359
did you know you're getting this and the

2346.72 --> 2349.52
other

2347.359 --> 2350.48
promotion so well that's just a

2349.52 --> 2353.52
correlation

2350.48 --> 2355.119
it certainly for me was if nothing else

2353.52 --> 2357.04
a psychological barrier that i wanted to

2355.119 --> 2359.119
get the the channel passed

2357.04 --> 2359.62
uh very hard muted from a niche don't

2359.119 --> 2362.79
worry

2359.62 --> 2362.79
[Music]

2363.04 --> 2368.72
right i remember that

2366.32 --> 2369.76
right i myself have a bit of a barrier

2368.72 --> 2372.8799999999997
it seems

2369.76 --> 2376.32
i just can't get over the 2k it just

2372.88 --> 2378.4
it refuses to happen i've been stuck

2376.32 --> 2380.2400000000002
there for a very long time it was very

2378.4 --> 2382.96
tough to get to the 1k

2380.24 --> 2385.4399999999996
but the climb up until that point was

2382.96 --> 2388.64
pretty straight and steady

2385.44 --> 2392.48
but like after it

2388.64 --> 2393.04
just went up in periods of interest and

2392.48 --> 2396.2400000000002
like

2393.04 --> 2399.119
when i did really good shows like one of

2396.24 --> 2400.16
the remember the mother of all bombs

2399.119 --> 2402.7200000000003
show that i did

2400.16 --> 2403.5989999999997
with nathan a whole long ago now what is

2402.72 --> 2405.839
it

2403.599 --> 2407.119
was that a better early bird show no i

2405.839 --> 2409.359
don't think so it was it's still in the

2407.119 --> 2412.0
flatter talks days

2409.359 --> 2413.68
that got me a lot of subs back in the

2412.0 --> 2417.68
day

2413.68 --> 2422.0789999999997
but it's been stuck around like 1900

2417.68 --> 2426.64
for over a year

2422.079 --> 2430.6400000000003
and just so so slowly climbing

2426.64 --> 2433.04
like once up maybe a week and then

2430.64 --> 2434.72
they go away again and then it just

2433.04 --> 2438.0
keeps on

2434.72 --> 2441.68
eating around the same level and i've

2438.0 --> 2444.64
got like 20 subs on average

2441.68 --> 2446.0789999999997
added to what i used to have for a very

2444.64 --> 2449.68
long time for a half year

2446.079 --> 2451.92
straight like at 1920

2449.68 --> 2454.8799999999997
and it was really thanks to your help

2451.92 --> 2457.2000000000003
nathan that i eventually got

2454.88 --> 2458.96
yeah that was 20 subs that that extra

2457.2 --> 2462.319
attention did bring them

2458.96 --> 2465.76
here i guess but it was weird because

2462.319 --> 2469.04
that was like the subs

2465.76 --> 2469.6800000000003
that added on didn't really translate

2469.04 --> 2471.839
into

2469.68 --> 2473.44
people like oh suddenly getting into

2471.839 --> 2474.7999999999997
chat like oh a whole bunch of people

2473.44 --> 2477.28
suddenly getting into chat

2474.8 --> 2478.96
right not like that it just they just

2477.28 --> 2482.96
happened to add on

2478.96 --> 2485.76
because the people that get in here

2482.96 --> 2487.599
it kind of goes at a random steady pace

2485.76 --> 2491.44
it hasn't really changed

2487.599 --> 2492.319
like people just seemingly randomly find

2491.44 --> 2495.76
me

2492.319 --> 2497.44
and then like what i do they

2495.76 --> 2498.8
start talking in chat and before you

2497.44 --> 2501.359
know it they're

2498.8 --> 2503.28
regular they got a wrench and we know

2501.359 --> 2509.68
each other for over a year

2503.28 --> 2512.8
so you still there nathan

2509.68 --> 2512.7999999999997
yeah absolutely all right

2514.0 --> 2520.72
but i i don't know how that works

2517.52 --> 2523.599
because the only people i really know

2520.72 --> 2524.48
and trust following me are the ones that

2523.599 --> 2527.6800000000003
are in chat

2524.48 --> 2527.68
the ones that know me

2532.4 --> 2535.44
well i'm just thinking of things off the

2533.76 --> 2537.0400000000004
top of my head but i know you could do

2535.44 --> 2538.56
to add to what you do already that would

2537.04 --> 2540.72
improve things but just waiting for a

2538.56 --> 2543.04
quiet moment to tell you

2540.72 --> 2543.04
okay

2545.359 --> 2550.0
i guess that would be sharing your own

2548.8 --> 2552.4
experience and how

2550.0 --> 2553.92
to do it because you put a lot of work

2552.4 --> 2558.2400000000002
in your channel

2553.92 --> 2560.7200000000003
you advertise a lot

2558.24 --> 2563.2799999999997
like you really actively try to spread

2560.72 --> 2566.3999999999996
it out everywhere

2563.28 --> 2568.7200000000003
so you are like an advertising spreader

2566.4 --> 2569.599
for your own channel a lot i don't

2568.72 --> 2573.2799999999997
really do that

2569.599 --> 2575.6800000000003
i mean i try to advertise just with my

2573.28 --> 2578.4
presence and hopefully i will

2575.68 --> 2580.48
draw an interest enough for people to

2578.4 --> 2582.7200000000003
kind of seek me out on my own channel

2580.48 --> 2584.96
and that's how i hope to do it

2582.72 --> 2586.0789999999997
but i've never been much for just raw

2584.96 --> 2590.16
advertisement

2586.079 --> 2592.48
for my channel always hoping to get the

2590.16 --> 2596.0789999999997
curious ones the ones that are that

2592.48 --> 2596.079
have natural curiosity

2600.16 --> 2604.72
sure i mean the thing i think you should

2602.319 --> 2606.96
do and it would be one small detail that

2604.72 --> 2608.16
normally nudge you over those sorts of

2606.96 --> 2610.4
marks like the 2k

2608.16 --> 2611.5989999999997
mark the the thing i would do is

2610.4 --> 2614.7200000000003
thumbnails

2611.599 --> 2615.44
which you don't do nothing else because

2614.72 --> 2616.9599999999996
initially you'd

2615.44 --> 2618.8
be something that you'd find that

2616.96 --> 2620.8
because you're not doing it

2618.8 --> 2623.119
you'd end up taking an hour from now

2620.8 --> 2624.88
you're like i could do a live show

2623.119 --> 2626.4
well that's the way i used to be before

2624.88 --> 2627.76
i made thumbnails which is going back a

2626.4 --> 2629.92
few years now

2627.76 --> 2631.599
and um it would it would take me an hour

2629.92 --> 2633.359
to make a thumbnail you're like oh this

2631.599 --> 2634.56
is so much work i can do a whole show in

2633.359 --> 2636.72
that time

2634.56 --> 2638.72
but after a time you get to be able to

2636.72 --> 2641.9199999999996
rattle them off in no time at all

2638.72 --> 2644.16
and then if you can focus five minutes

2641.92 --> 2645.839
say after each show and think what was

2644.16 --> 2648.3999999999996
the main theme that we covered in the

2645.839 --> 2649.2
in that show and then bosch out a

2648.4 --> 2650.7200000000003
thumbnail

2649.2 --> 2652.0789999999997
and i'm going to do it just for the sake

2650.72 --> 2653.2799999999997
just to show you what i mean while we're

2652.079 --> 2655.28
having this conversation

2653.28 --> 2657.8390000000004
and it's nice here i'm going to skype

2655.28 --> 2659.44
you a thumbnail for this show

2657.839 --> 2661.2
while i'm while i'm talking doing the

2659.44 --> 2661.599
dishwasher and managing the noise level

2661.2 --> 2664.64
so

2661.599 --> 2668.079
you're my commute all right all right

2664.64 --> 2669.52
okay i agree and even like how you

2668.079 --> 2671.76
described it yeah

2669.52 --> 2672.88
you're right you're right it would get

2671.76 --> 2675.76
easier over time

2672.88 --> 2677.359
problem with me though and having a

2675.76 --> 2679.92
daily show

2677.359 --> 2680.4
most of the time i really can't even

2679.92 --> 2682.88
think of

2680.4 --> 2683.52
a title not even after the show not even

2682.88 --> 2686.8
after i

2683.52 --> 2690.48
watched the show back i just

2686.8 --> 2691.04
it just really there's no inspiration

2690.48 --> 2693.359
often

2691.04 --> 2694.96
it's just like okay just weird wild

2693.359 --> 2698.7999999999997
subjects

2694.96 --> 2701.2
or subjects that are good but that i

2698.8 --> 2703.44
don't want to put in the title i want

2701.2 --> 2705.359
people to randomly stumble upon it i

2703.44 --> 2708.0
don't want to draw attention to that

2705.359 --> 2710.319
specific subject even right when it's

2708.0 --> 2714.319
like really

2710.319 --> 2716.8
about current day spellcraft for example

2714.319 --> 2718.319
and i take a lot of liberty in just

2716.8 --> 2719.2000000000003
rolling it out just saying like oh you

2718.319 --> 2721.2
can't talk about it

2719.2 --> 2722.72
then i'm gonna talk about it now but

2721.2 --> 2726.3999999999996
that doesn't mean that i'm gonna

2722.72 --> 2728.64
put that as advertisement on my show

2726.4 --> 2732.0
so for me often it's very difficult to

2728.64 --> 2734.4
even find a title

2732.0 --> 2738.319
gonna have trouble with that then

2734.4 --> 2738.319
actually making a picture for it

2738.56 --> 2746.7999999999997
but i agree it would probably

2743.2 --> 2749.1189999999997
like polish up my show

2746.8 --> 2750.96
more and probably draw in some people

2749.119 --> 2751.839
because there are people out there that

2750.96 --> 2754.88
are like

2751.839 --> 2757.68
they use it as a threshold they just

2754.88 --> 2760.48
like even as i upgraded my sound by

2757.68 --> 2762.56
getting a better microphone like

2760.48 --> 2763.92
that got me subscribers because there

2762.56 --> 2765.92
were a whole bunch of people

2763.92 --> 2767.92
that were like they couldn't handle how

2765.92 --> 2770.079
bad my sound was they literally

2767.92 --> 2771.6800000000003
like confessed it to me in chat like i

2770.079 --> 2773.44
can't listen to this

2771.68 --> 2774.96
like yeah you might be saying something

2773.44 --> 2777.119
interesting but i can't listen to this

2774.96 --> 2780.0
because your sound is so bad

2777.119 --> 2782.2400000000002
and when i changed it yeah a whole bunch

2780.0 --> 2784.319
of people came rolling in

2782.24 --> 2786.0789999999997
so and there might be others out there

2784.319 --> 2787.359
that are like wow i'm not even gonna

2786.079 --> 2788.96
watch a video

2787.359 --> 2790.48
that doesn't have thumbnails just the

2788.96 --> 2791.359
same thing over and over i'm not even

2790.48 --> 2794.16
going to click that

2791.359 --> 2795.92
they'll just have that tenacious habit

2794.16 --> 2798.48
inside of them

2795.92 --> 2799.44
so there you go one handed whilst doing

2798.48 --> 2801.68
my dishwasher

2799.44 --> 2803.04
i'll post you out a thumbnail to today's

2801.68 --> 2805.5989999999997
show right

2803.04 --> 2807.839
and just just to see if the points made

2805.599 --> 2809.76
and you can do this i'm sure you can

2807.839 --> 2810.96
of going into the youtube live studio

2809.76 --> 2812.96
and assigning this

2810.96 --> 2816.319
live show with a new thumbnail don't

2812.96 --> 2819.2
have to do that

2816.319 --> 2821.44
uh yeah i should be able to let me show

2819.2 --> 2822.96
it first to the

2821.44 --> 2824.319
don't show anybody your screen of what

2822.96 --> 2825.68
you're doing just do it off screen if

2824.319 --> 2827.2
you want me to chat so you don't have to

2825.68 --> 2828.64
talk to your audience while you do it

2827.2 --> 2830.0
and you can do it off screen so that you

2828.64 --> 2830.8799999999997
don't risk anything being shown that

2830.0 --> 2833.2
shouldn't be

2830.88 --> 2834.319
but just do it off screen or look at

2833.2 --> 2835.359
your screen for your audience or

2834.319 --> 2836.8
whatever you put up when there's a

2835.359 --> 2837.7599999999998
moment of silence normally you just

2836.8 --> 2840.2400000000002
leave your

2837.76 --> 2844.88
screen then you just run away that's

2840.24 --> 2847.839
something else you can change

2844.88 --> 2848.96
the periods of dead earth but i wouldn't

2847.839 --> 2851.04
worry about that for now don't worry

2848.96 --> 2852.4
about anything except i would say

2851.04 --> 2854.24
working out a couple of pieces of

2852.4 --> 2856.079
software that you like

2854.24 --> 2857.359
that you can get familiar with and then

2856.079 --> 2860.1600000000003
wash out thumbnails

2857.359 --> 2862.16
i use three different apps just because

2860.16 --> 2863.2
they're very specific about one function

2862.16 --> 2865.7599999999998
one is a specific

2863.2 --> 2867.2
adding text app and all it does is add

2865.76 --> 2869.92
text and crop

2867.2 --> 2870.96
basic stuff but i'll import it into that

2869.92 --> 2873.28
as the thumbnail

2870.96 --> 2875.119
and then crop it and put the text on you

2873.28 --> 2876.88
know another one i use is to layer stuff

2875.119 --> 2878.2400000000002
you know i can take two images remove a

2876.88 --> 2879.44
background and one and layer over the

2878.24 --> 2880.9599999999996
top of the other and that's pretty much

2879.44 --> 2884.559
all that app does

2880.96 --> 2887.2
um what else do i use one two

2884.559 --> 2887.76
remember there's very very few stuff

2887.2 --> 2889.2799999999997
that you need

2887.76 --> 2890.96
or very few apps that you need to do a

2889.28 --> 2891.76
basic thumbnail and if you can get

2890.96 --> 2894.559
familiar with

2891.76 --> 2896.8
one or two that just do a basic job of

2894.559 --> 2899.28
getting it into 16 by nine go on

2896.8 --> 2900.2400000000002
i i got the text you know i got a

2899.28 --> 2902.48
photoshop

2900.24 --> 2904.24
that can do a lot with still images you

2902.48 --> 2906.4
know usually when it becomes

2904.24 --> 2908.24
things have to move around like video

2906.4 --> 2910.8
that's where i run into trouble

2908.24 --> 2912.24
but my photoshop can handle everything

2910.8 --> 2914.1600000000003
it's an old version

2912.24 --> 2916.319
that's ideal because it's very very very

2914.16 --> 2917.68
powerful but also quite complex and

2916.319 --> 2918.96
cumbersome so you might not be able to

2917.68 --> 2921.2
rattle through it quickly

2918.96 --> 2922.079
no no no it's an old version and it's

2921.2 --> 2924.7999999999997
very

2922.079 --> 2927.44
it's built for like computers at like

2924.8 --> 2927.6800000000003
120th strength of what i have currently

2927.44 --> 2929.76
so

2927.68 --> 2931.7599999999998
right so you can do a basic so you can

2929.76 --> 2933.5200000000004
overlay text and remove a background and

2931.76 --> 2935.92
interlace two pictures together

2933.52 --> 2936.72
perfect yeah i should be able to do that

2935.92 --> 2939.359
it's

2936.72 --> 2941.839
i've not really learned how to do that a

2939.359 --> 2943.2799999999997
lot but i do know it's possible i've

2941.839 --> 2945.52
done it before

2943.28 --> 2946.88
way back perfect if you've got that

2945.52 --> 2947.92
piece of software and it's a good piece

2946.88 --> 2949.839
of software and you

2947.92 --> 2951.04
even got a mild familiarity with it

2949.839 --> 2953.359
you'll get quickly

2951.04 --> 2954.72
used to it and your time in terms of

2953.359 --> 2956.4
making a thumbnail if you can get it

2954.72 --> 2959.359
down to about five minutes

2956.4 --> 2959.839
that's ideal and then after each show

2959.359 --> 2962.24
just

2959.839 --> 2963.839
make it routine in other words you

2962.24 --> 2965.52
finish your show whatever you do

2963.839 --> 2967.119
for me there's a whole bunch of admin i

2965.52 --> 2968.0
do after a show finishes i don't finish

2967.119 --> 2970.48
for probably an

2968.0 --> 2971.92
hour after the show actually finishes my

2970.48 --> 2973.599
live show not even the live show after

2971.92 --> 2976.16
the uncut show finishes

2973.599 --> 2977.839
i've got an hour of work ahead of me

2976.16 --> 2979.839
just to get the shows onto different

2977.839 --> 2982.24
channels etc etc

2979.839 --> 2983.92
anyway that aside for you don't worry

2982.24 --> 2985.2
about an hour of admin and publishing on

2983.92 --> 2986.0
different channels and all the crap i

2985.2 --> 2988.96
have to do

2986.0 --> 2990.319
worry about five minutes on a thumbnail

2988.96 --> 2992.64
for each one

2990.319 --> 2994.0
my methodology for the show titles

2992.64 --> 2995.839
because i don't do this for the show

2994.0 --> 2997.68
i've already got i've completely packed

2995.839 --> 2998.96
i wish i could do this which is why i'm

2997.68 --> 3000.24
suggesting it to you because i know it

2998.96 --> 3001.359
would make a difference for me and i've

3000.24 --> 3003.2
got time

3001.359 --> 3005.2799999999997
um is to make an individual one for each

3003.2 --> 3007.5989999999997
of the live shows i don't

3005.28 --> 3009.599
but what i do now is title them and the

3007.599 --> 3012.559
way i do is the friends structure

3009.599 --> 3013.599
the one with so i just think what's this

3012.559 --> 3016.559
the one with

3013.599 --> 3018.1600000000003
it's the one with virus being an idiot

3016.559 --> 3019.6800000000003
and he then you try and be specific

3018.16 --> 3022.5589999999997
about what he's been an idiot about

3019.68 --> 3023.839
the one with virus and his 90 degree

3022.559 --> 3026.559
tangents to the sun

3023.839 --> 3028.64
how can i make that a little bit shorter

3026.559 --> 3030.3190000000004
viruses 90 degree tangents

3028.64 --> 3032.319
and then that's it the one with nine

3030.319 --> 3033.359
viruses 90 degree tangents becomes my

3032.319 --> 3035.2799999999997
title and it took

3033.359 --> 3036.7999999999997
a minute to give it the actual thought

3035.28 --> 3039.119
to make it reasonably

3036.8 --> 3040.88
decent as a title and as you saw from my

3039.119 --> 3041.599
thumbnail once you shut once your show's

3040.88 --> 3044.079
finished

3041.599 --> 3045.44
just clip out a nice picture of yourself

3044.079 --> 3046.96
that's it and then you just put a black

3045.44 --> 3047.839
background with words on it on the left

3046.96 --> 3049.76
hand side

3047.839 --> 3051.44
really basic thumbnail structure which

3049.76 --> 3053.44
is the title of whatever that show is

3051.44 --> 3055.119
you're because you're on camera you have

3053.44 --> 3056.319
a new portrait every day it's the only

3055.119 --> 3057.599
reason i go on camera

3056.319 --> 3059.119
especially as i'm getting older and

3057.599 --> 3060.1600000000003
uglier you know it's just so that

3059.119 --> 3062.1600000000003
basically you've got a

3060.16 --> 3064.0
brand new something that's got a person

3062.16 --> 3065.359
in it that you can have in a various

3064.0 --> 3066.8
expression if you've pointed off

3065.359 --> 3068.24
into the distance one day or you're

3066.8 --> 3068.88
looking out the window with you in frame

3068.24 --> 3070.319
one day

3068.88 --> 3071.839
that's a new thumbnail that you can put

3070.319 --> 3073.2799999999997
a new set of words next to and it's

3071.839 --> 3075.44
completely unique

3073.28 --> 3077.0400000000004
perfect that's all you need so you being

3075.44 --> 3078.559
on camera gives you an ability to snap

3077.04 --> 3079.92
up a thumbnail and just crop it down to

3078.559 --> 3081.599
69 every day

3079.92 --> 3083.44
and have it be completely unique every

3081.599 --> 3085.04
day without any thought in the

3083.44 --> 3086.48
in what's going to be in the image well

3085.04 --> 3088.0
what's the show about it's you

3086.48 --> 3089.76
and you're on camera so have that

3088.0 --> 3091.04
thumbnail every day just crop a new

3089.76 --> 3092.3190000000004
picture of yourself every day and just

3091.04 --> 3093.839
put words on the left hand side of it

3092.319 --> 3098.24
like often

3093.839 --> 3098.24
easy that'll get you over 2k

3099.599 --> 3102.8
done there you go all right

3103.119 --> 3110.1600000000003
right yeah it's definitely worth

3104.64 --> 3112.8799999999997
considering did you like my thumbnail

3110.16 --> 3114.3999999999996
not particularly it's all right it's all

3112.88 --> 3117.2000000000003
right

3114.4 --> 3119.119
well yeah sure well if you're gonna just

3117.2 --> 3121.9199999999996
as a random thing sure

3119.119 --> 3122.559
well you tell me after the fact if that

3121.92 --> 3124.559
show

3122.559 --> 3126.6400000000003
just consistently do no thumbnail for

3124.559 --> 3128.1600000000003
the next week and then after a week go

3126.64 --> 3130.24
back and look if this show

3128.16 --> 3131.92
with this thumbnail don't change the

3130.24 --> 3134.16
title don't add it a special title

3131.92 --> 3135.52
just the thumbnail see if it makes a

3134.16 --> 3138.24
difference to the views

3135.52 --> 3139.52
well you know what maybe i'll just gonna

3138.24 --> 3142.24
take a picture of

3139.52 --> 3143.119
you from another show and then use that

3142.24 --> 3144.72
in the title and

3143.119 --> 3146.1600000000003
let's see what happens then that's

3144.72 --> 3152.8799999999997
cheating because then

3146.16 --> 3154.7999999999997
yeah it is

3152.88 --> 3156.4
just the thumbnail that says this is

3154.8 --> 3158.2400000000002
what today's show's about

3156.4 --> 3160.079
you're you're 100 times more likely for

3158.24 --> 3163.04
someone to look at a thumbnail that says

3160.079 --> 3164.96
the youtube maze and they go oh it's

3163.04 --> 3165.52
about youtube and navigating it i might

3164.96 --> 3168.96
watch that

3165.52 --> 3170.8
if it's just flat earth early bird 476

3168.96 --> 3172.7200000000003
you go i've got no idea what it's about

3170.8 --> 3174.7200000000003
you're far less likely to click on it

3172.72 --> 3176.7999999999997
um but you know after the fact you want

3174.72 --> 3178.319
the for 24 hours you want people to be

3176.8 --> 3179.599
wanting to click on that video after

3178.319 --> 3181.119
you've done making it

3179.599 --> 3183.28
and all it will take is just a tiny

3181.119 --> 3185.04
little bit of thought in in the title

3183.28 --> 3187.28
and putting it on the thumbnail

3185.04 --> 3188.88
uh how you make thumbnails and that will

3187.28 --> 3192.079
that will definitely get you more subs

3188.88 --> 3192.079
and definitely grow your channel

3192.559 --> 3196.96
okay yeah thanks for the tips that's all

3195.76 --> 3200.3190000000004
right my pleasure we're trying to do the

3196.96 --> 3200.319

uh because i missed a whole bunch of

3269.839 --> 3279.839
what

3271.44 --> 3279.839
you have been saying

3282.319 --> 3285.599
hey seeking star war

3290.839 --> 3293.839
okay

3332.839 --> 3335.839
turn

3336.799 --> 3339.119
what

3346.559 --> 3353.3590000000004
where did okay so there's another like

3350.0 --> 3353.359
total meltdown event

3360.079 --> 3365.2000000000003
the whole village just disintegrated

3363.76 --> 3367.5200000000004
george sanford is that what you're

3365.2 --> 3367.52
saying

3368.96 --> 3379.44
right tera306

3376.079 --> 3383.8390000000004
anyway i am gonna round out the show

3379.44 --> 3386.96
so yeah i'll try to i'm gonna put that

3383.839 --> 3386.96
weird title card

3388.4 --> 3391.92
in the show let's see yeah just to try

3391.2 --> 3395.2799999999997
it out

3391.92 --> 3396.4
if i can change it afterward i had a bit

3395.28 --> 3399.28
of a hassle with

3396.4 --> 3400.079
even trying that image for a long time

3399.28 --> 3403.2000000000003
that's why

3400.079 --> 3406.2400000000002
when i just got it back to the

3403.2 --> 3410.64
the what is it the rectangular looping

3406.24 --> 3412.8799999999997
image that i made

3410.64 --> 3414.799
when it was on that i was just happy

3412.88 --> 3418.319
enough like ah finally at least

3414.799 --> 3421.599
halfway decent image for it but

3418.319 --> 3422.799
yeah what nathan said did ring true and

3421.599 --> 3426.2400000000002
i should probably

3422.799 --> 3433.839
try and again it's

3426.24 --> 3433.839
seriously an everyday show so

3434.079 --> 3442.1600000000003
i don't know we'll see

3438.24 --> 3447.2799999999997
but it's it is a good practical advice

3442.16 --> 3461.839
i have to give him that

3447.28 --> 3461.8390000000004
cute okay let's good to hear kristin
