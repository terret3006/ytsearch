attention I don't know if we can hear

58.5 --> 63.96
that through my microphone yeah the

62.309 --> 73.2
birds are very active at the moment

63.96 --> 76.5
outside yeah so so far I only see Daniel

Fieldman chip oh yeah I forgot to put

76.5 --> 79.25
out the links

84.659 --> 93.02000000000001
yep yeah I I almost forgot or pretty

89.189 --> 95.609
much 50 minutes before starting the show

93.02 --> 96.359
remember oh yeah wait Monday it's an

95.609 --> 99.329
hour early

96.359 --> 103.89
at least this Monday if I'm correct

99.329 --> 108.5
Nathan's gonna start a regular time from

103.89 --> 115.28
now on so this will be the last early

108.5 --> 115.28
Monday for me as well just kind of nice

122.06 --> 137.16
yeah please share this show if you're

125.129 --> 139.37
watching wake people up come on watch

137.16 --> 143.819
the show

139.37 --> 148.31
anyway yeah pretty much the same

143.819 --> 148.31
scenario yesterday

160.59 --> 165.83
I don't know for me

167.45 --> 170.45
Asian

179.45 --> 186.6
for me I don't know I get I made the

182.52 --> 189.18
predictions a long time ago and a few

186.6 --> 191.07
weeks ago and I described it how the

189.18 --> 195.66
division between the sleepers and

191.07 --> 200.87
awakens woods aggravate and what would

195.66 --> 200.87
happen as a result to both these

201.29 --> 209.64
spiritual cultures I guess you could

203.76 --> 214.62
call it it's not it's more subconscious

209.64 --> 218.54999999999998
culture then than a typical subculture

214.62 --> 224.52
or whatever it's just I don't know it's

218.55 --> 227.34
not so easy to really point out baller

224.52 --> 228.99
versus Flat Earth what that is what

227.34 --> 236.97
these groups really are what they

228.99 --> 241.26000000000002
present in society subculture I don't

236.97 --> 244.25
know it's not it's too controversial for

241.26 --> 244.25
that

248.06 --> 256.65
anyway I'm drifting off my point is that

252.81 --> 263.58
I think I got it got it pretty good

256.65 --> 270.09
overview now off what's going on where

263.58 --> 273.65
it's going gradually and it's very very

270.09 --> 277.97999999999996
hard for me to look into it and see

273.65 --> 279.96
something really new to highlight and

277.98 --> 282.75
since I'm always digging for new stuff

279.96 --> 284.96999999999997
for new angles to approach for new

282.75 --> 287.28
things to show to share people to make

284.97 --> 289.59000000000003
people think about it's kind of tough

287.28 --> 292.55999999999995
because I don't like repeating myself I

289.59 --> 296.69
only do it when it is called for when it

292.56 --> 300.03000000000003
is specifically necessary and people ask

296.69 --> 303.96
but I typically don't do that by myself

300.03 --> 311.88
I don't like repeating myself if nobody

303.96 --> 315.0
asks or if nobody is asking for it yeah

311.88 --> 324.63
I do repeat myself of course but only if

315.0 --> 335.99
the situation demands it so I should

324.63 --> 335.99
probably put out panel link that

341.97 --> 345.02900000000005
[Music]

357.99 --> 360.02
Oh

369.66 --> 378.34000000000003
all right so links are out there and

372.04 --> 380.71000000000004
Skype I did get a couple of talk by

378.34 --> 383.38
people contacting your skype that hasn't

380.71 --> 388.9
actually happened which was always

383.38 --> 390.96999999999997
disappointing was a commenter for

388.9 --> 393.34
example didn't seem very Flat Earth

390.97 --> 397.09000000000003
related and yeah he did that I haven't

393.34 --> 398.89
seen or heard anything about him so I

397.09 --> 405.47999999999996
wonder if he was just trying to

398.89 --> 408.34
advertise its kind of seems nathan is

405.48 --> 412.41
doing that also and I don't blame him

408.34 --> 417.88
it's like looking for massive platforms

412.41 --> 420.34000000000003
where yeah there's also kind of stupid

417.88 --> 422.26
stuff for people to just stare at and

420.34 --> 423.90999999999997
that seems to be very popular that's a

422.26 --> 426.01
lot of people out there that are dumb

423.91 --> 429.70000000000005
enough to actually enjoy just staring at

426.01 --> 431.95
dumb stuff I don't know maybe I'm just

429.7 --> 437.2
getting old and I don't get the company

431.95 --> 439.69
of the future I don't know but yeah he

437.2 --> 443.11
makes comments and then refers to Flat

439.69 --> 445.169
Earth and to show and just to see if

443.11 --> 447.82
people come across it and that's just

445.169 --> 450.90999999999997
basic social media advertisement and

447.82 --> 453.43
yeah there's other people doing that as

450.91 --> 458.29
well so yeah we may receive comments

453.43 --> 460.15000000000003
from people that have nothing to do with

458.29 --> 461.83000000000004
Flat Earth and yet if they're like

460.15 --> 464.25
direct advertisers with links and

461.83 --> 468.12
everything then it's very obvious

464.25 --> 471.34
they are like literally advertising just

468.12 --> 474.07
wanting the link to be clicked etc

471.34 --> 476.28999999999996
basically wanting the attention stealing

474.07 --> 479.32
it away but yeah there's other ways you

476.29 --> 482.88
can just say try to be a person of

479.32 --> 485.65
interest and just say hello contact and

482.88 --> 487.24
then people will at least look at your

485.65 --> 489.90999999999997
channel see what you're doing who is

487.24 --> 492.52
this person so that's a more modest way

489.91 --> 495.49
of social media advertisement that

492.52 --> 498.19
really does work because if somebody I

495.49 --> 499.99
don't know does just say hello I like to

498.19 --> 502.78
talk to you even though that could be

499.99 --> 506.889
fake I will click on them will look

502.78 --> 508.97999999999996
who are these people so yeah that's

506.889 --> 511.57
actually much smarter than just

508.98 --> 514.57
blatantly advertising with the link to

511.57 --> 517.36
the channel go watch this because yeah

514.57 --> 519.49
most people tend to overlook that now

517.36 --> 521.969
just see it as advertisement spam

519.49 --> 524.86
somebody that doesn't really care so I

521.969 --> 531.6700000000001
don't know maybe I'm just giving tips

524.86 --> 535.33
out that I shouldn't anyway it is a way

531.67 --> 540.9399999999999
of social media advertising it's not bad

535.33 --> 543.25
to do it but yeah if everyone would be

540.94 --> 546.72
doing it then it would be much harder to

543.25 --> 550.24
actually find people that are genuinely

546.72 --> 553.6
interesting to talk with because a lot

550.24 --> 559.42
people will just be pretending just to

553.6 --> 562.24
get some clicking so yeah that's not a

559.42 --> 565.0
very present foresight but on the other

562.24 --> 570.0600000000001
hand yeah we already know so many people

565.0 --> 572.98
you know I couldn't even imagine like

570.06 --> 575.5
toppling or maybe doubling but like

572.98 --> 577.089
quadrupling or something the amount of

575.5 --> 579.01
people that I know in the flattered

577.089 --> 583.69
scene like really getting to know all of

579.01 --> 586.99
them I do I get all messed up I don't

583.69 --> 591.6400000000001
have so much room in my mind to know so

586.99 --> 595.12
many people so it's just not my greatest

591.64 --> 600.55
talent I'm more thorough with each

595.12 --> 605.44
person but that also narrows these the

600.55 --> 610.87
quantity for me anyway I'm just rambling

605.44 --> 620.73
on see you joined the chat and wonder

610.87 --> 620.73
class yeah I did actually

621.93 --> 625.3199999999999
it was nice

630.199 --> 633.199
so

648.24 --> 661.3
yeah I don't know you know how sometimes

657.39 --> 663.24
people like just in the streets or

661.3 --> 668.1099999999999
whatever are gonna have a conversation

663.24 --> 670.84
like in another language as Dutch or

668.11 --> 672.5500000000001
English because yeah it's pretty widely

670.84 --> 674.77
known that if you're gonna talk English

672.55 --> 676.54
that most people are gonna probably

674.77 --> 678.9399999999999
understand you here in the Netherlands

676.54 --> 681.8499999999999
but it's really funny that some people

678.94 --> 686.35
like have their own language which could

681.85 --> 688.6
be like North African Arabian sometimes

686.35 --> 691.9
even like Russian or some other Slavic

688.6 --> 694.6
language and they'll just talk among

691.9 --> 696.97
themselves and they will talk about

694.6 --> 699.1
other people potentially that are

696.97 --> 701.0500000000001
standing right next to them and this

699.1 --> 703.99
happens to me sometimes I find it

701.05 --> 706.3599999999999
hilarious because I do listen to

703.99 --> 709.42
absolutely everything I just can't help

706.36 --> 712.0600000000001
it and it's really funny when people

709.42 --> 714.3399999999999
talking another language about me try to

712.06 --> 721.3299999999999
describe or pin point down like what am

714.34 --> 728.1700000000001
I like with with the way I look and and

721.33 --> 731.83
a long black trench coat and yeah they

728.17 --> 734.8299999999999
try to interpret that and it's really

731.83 --> 739.72
funny what some people suspect that I

734.83 --> 741.5200000000001
could be and you know it's funny that

739.72 --> 744.9300000000001
people think that they can talk in

741.52 --> 747.4
another language and that you won't

744.93 --> 752.4599999999999
understand that you're being talked

747.4 --> 755.8299999999999
about like you can't pick out words

752.46 --> 758.85
especially because even people using

755.83 --> 762.1600000000001
other languages and this is really funny

758.85 --> 764.95
there's a lot of terminologies in just

762.16 --> 769.03
regular talk in like for example gamer

764.95 --> 773.6500000000001
talk that other languages just take as

769.03 --> 775.6
they take the words non translated to

773.65 --> 779.47
their own language in English just in

775.6 --> 782.08
between their foreign tongue sentences

779.47 --> 784.6600000000001
and these words are very rare

782.08 --> 789.49
and that's especially a larry's because

784.66 --> 793.3
yet a lot of guys like age bracket

789.49 --> 795.79
between 20 and 40 that are just going

793.3 --> 801.01
around doing stuff we business of life

795.79 --> 802.99
of unification they will be known with

801.01 --> 805.6899999999999
the gamer season many of them are gamers

802.99 --> 807.519
up to a certain level and they will have

805.69 --> 809.7
these language elements so when these

807.519 --> 813.579
people are talking about somebody else

809.7 --> 815.7090000000001
whatever context yeah you may pick up

813.579 --> 817.9799999999999
some of these words that aren't

815.709 --> 820.81
translated and by the way the Dutch

817.98 --> 822.16
themselves in the Dutch language do this

820.81 --> 825.3389999999999
a lot as well

822.16 --> 828.8199999999999
we have grafted in a lot of English

825.339 --> 832.57
phrases from television language from

828.82 --> 835.3000000000001
computer game language it's actually I

832.57 --> 839.32
personally have a distaste for using it

835.3 --> 841.779
it feels very cheap to do that and you

839.32 --> 845.44
could if you take the effort properly

841.779 --> 848.92
translated into Dutch oh and still sound

845.44 --> 851.2600000000001
eloquent and yeah not overly complicated

848.92 --> 855.1899999999999
but most people are just lazy and isn't

851.26 --> 858.459
it just use English game and television

855.19 --> 860.8900000000001
language in English just right through

858.459 --> 863.17
the Dutch because they can't find the

860.89 --> 867.91
proper Dutch word for it because yeah

863.17 --> 870.79
the Dutch the Dutch language used to be

867.91 --> 874.39
a really heavy intricate complicated

870.79 --> 876.2199999999999
language and was held in high regard and

874.39 --> 877.4499999999999
you could like really focus and if

876.22 --> 879.61
there's still people doing it

877.45 --> 882.87
you've really find it back in the 20th

879.61 --> 885.37
century literature a lot that the way

882.87 --> 888.1
the details of the writing and the

885.37 --> 891.4590000000001
details of the meaning of the words and

888.1 --> 893.64
angles and all that it was really talked

891.459 --> 896.5
about a lot now things have just

893.64 --> 899.38
degraded and the Dutch language isn't

896.5 --> 903.22
really recognized as so complex anymore

899.38 --> 906.519
because things have been dumbing down in

903.22 --> 910.24
the media in the production's it becomes

906.519 --> 912.82
more simpler probably so that anywhere

910.24 --> 914.9300000000001
every one can get it even the ones that

912.82 --> 918.3290000000001
aren't really good

914.93 --> 922.4699999999999
but yet that degrades the knowledge base

918.329 --> 925.7399999999999
of the Dutch language itself and because

922.47 --> 928.019
this effects all of society especially

925.74 --> 933.649
the younger generations like up until

928.019 --> 937.11
the 30s they will then resort to just

933.649 --> 940.98
picking out words directly out what

937.11 --> 942.839
they're using that's the alternative so

940.98 --> 945.149
yeah there's a lot of English being

942.839 --> 947.97
grafted into the Dutch language by

945.149 --> 951.81
people in impracticality because of this

947.97 --> 953.5790000000001
and it's annoying but yeah we're not the

951.81 --> 955.5
only ones and it's really funny when

953.579 --> 958.41
somebody else talks behind your back

955.5 --> 961.11
about you that you don't know and they

958.41 --> 962.8389999999999
use these words so you kind of get a

961.11 --> 965.2090000000001
picture of what they're trying to

962.839 --> 969.36
describe us or what they think you are

965.209 --> 975.329
it's funny no I don't take ill

969.36 --> 977.61
intentions I do look pretty wild I can

975.329 --> 979.9799999999999
yeah not in an extravagant way but I

977.61 --> 988.91
look pretty wild compared to most people

979.98 --> 995.49
like this hard black and sober and that

988.91 --> 998.399
combination is unusual in its very

995.49 --> 1002.389
contrasting with what the average people

998.399 --> 1007.76
here do which again reference this also

1002.389 --> 1010.899
this like this being gay is being happy

1007.76 --> 1014.12
trend and a lot of people just try that

1010.899 --> 1020.63
just try to be oh look I'm so happy and

1014.12 --> 1023.54
innocent look at no colory and just not

1020.63 --> 1026.689
a lot of they don't radiate a lot of

1023.54 --> 1029.8999999999999
strength because of this and I do try

1026.689 --> 1032.15
the exact opposite and I've been doing

1029.9 --> 1034.189
this for a long time so I'm really into

1032.15 --> 1039.5890000000002
it I'm used to this is part of my

1034.189 --> 1041.959
identity now even though it is isolating

1039.589 --> 1044.049
in a way but I'm so used to it and the

1041.959 --> 1047.779
funny thing is that other people don't

1044.049 --> 1050.09
they're mystified that I am um so

1047.779 --> 1052.549
all furnivall and used to in my

1050.09 --> 1054.9789999999998
radiation in my appearance in the way I

1052.549 --> 1057.559
look I look 10 years ago I also was

1054.979 --> 1060.049
walking around like this maybe slightly

1057.559 --> 1062.69
different but mostly the same and I was

1060.049 --> 1065.139
still very nervous like yeah I look so

1062.69 --> 1069.289
different I looks so standing out and

1065.139 --> 1074.5089999999998
even way before that like 15 years ago I

1069.289 --> 1078.499
was in the gothic scene and that was

1074.509 --> 1081.049
like supposed to you're supposed to do

1078.499 --> 1083.6290000000001
that I thought that like you're supposed

1081.049 --> 1087.769
to stand out and look inspiring or

1083.629 --> 1089.599
creepy or weird yeah and look there some

1087.769 --> 1091.999
people out there that do that really

1089.599 --> 1095.57
extremely and I've always thought like

1091.999 --> 1098.779
whoa no that's way too far I'm not gonna

1095.57 --> 1101.539
go that crazy but yeah I did it pretty

1098.779 --> 1106.009
much as a challenge to myself like yeah

1101.539 --> 1107.929
I am a gothic and almost like really new

1106.009 --> 1109.489
visually almost yeah you imagine

1107.929 --> 1111.44
sweating on your foreheads well yeah I'm

1109.489 --> 1115.3690000000001
grabbing a lot of attention while I'm

1111.44 --> 1117.289
actually kind of socially phobic for

1115.369 --> 1119.749
other people so it was a heavy challenge

1117.289 --> 1123.219
I put on myself and it took a long time

1119.749 --> 1128.32
and then I kind of stepped out of the

1123.219 --> 1130.969
the wider way yeah the more

1128.32 --> 1135.729
fundamentalist Gothic thinking that's

1130.969 --> 1140.749
just called it like that and changed to

1135.729 --> 1143.8990000000001
just taking some things out of the

1140.749 --> 1147.039
gothic scene and for the rest taking

1143.899 --> 1150.529
some things out of what I learned from

1147.039 --> 1152.539
family culture and just the path of

1150.529 --> 1155.299
Christ all things put together and

1152.539 --> 1159.32
that's what I've become so I still wear

1155.299 --> 1163.489
black like a gothic pretty weirdly

1159.32 --> 1165.889
persistently but I am not really

1163.489 --> 1171.049
propelled by the same motivations and

1165.889 --> 1175.129
views as I used to be it's taken on

1171.049 --> 1179.929
another meaning in that sense but yeah I

1175.129 --> 1181.3899999999999
do kind of stand out so I'm used to it

1179.929 --> 1184.6100000000001
now just used to it

1181.39 --> 1186.89
it's my decision it's like a statement

1184.61 --> 1190.4599999999998
of personal statement it's a personal

1186.89 --> 1196.76
challenge that I've pretty much overcome

1190.46 --> 1199.1000000000001
I think I got something now I like there

1196.76 --> 1203.36
is something manifested surrounding my

1199.1 --> 1209.9299999999998
being and now I can continue on and see

1203.36 --> 1213.1999999999998
whatever I can build with it how can I

1209.93 --> 1218.96
maneuver with what I've become and the

1213.2 --> 1221.99
knowledge that I have and already use my

1218.96 --> 1225.17
looks in different approaches are given

1221.99 --> 1231.71
to spread this like yeah you can be

1225.17 --> 1233.78
wearing all black and sounds kind of bad

1231.71 --> 1238.1000000000001
like this but like act like you're a

1233.78 --> 1242.1499999999999
real Christian and technically I am so

1238.1 --> 1245.77
that's not actually a lie but yeah I'd

1242.15 --> 1251.3300000000002
probably add to start be acting more

1245.77 --> 1255.8899999999999
into a type like I am a you say a more

1251.33 --> 1257.99
conservative Protestant time because

1255.89 --> 1262.01
Protestants also wear black a lot so

1257.99 --> 1264.95
that's an angle for me or like in more

1262.01 --> 1267.17
party situations I could like really use

1264.95 --> 1269.96
the mystery of the entire black thing

1267.17 --> 1272.24
and big contrast and like pretend look

1269.96 --> 1275.8400000000001
more like a magician type person and

1272.24 --> 1277.85
just be fascinating and amusing that

1275.84 --> 1281.27
kind of [ __ ] yeah yeah you know Flat

1277.85 --> 1283.85
Earth it's good nothing is more

1281.27 --> 1286.97
astounding than flattering a party

1283.85 --> 1288.74
usually if everybody's in a good mood

1286.97 --> 1290.69
and you know there's not some really

1288.74 --> 1294.26
fanatical baller in between that's gonna

1290.69 --> 1304.43
be pissed off but that's an approach to

1294.26 --> 1308.44
use it and yeah also in situations where

1304.43 --> 1312.92
for example you running like a gang

1308.44 --> 1314.46
figures or whatever they're less likely

1312.92 --> 1319.6490000000001
to actually

1314.46 --> 1322.1100000000001
I rash you although yeah if there's like

1319.649 --> 1324.629
groups of people it's very rare that if

1322.11 --> 1327.119
they have like this gang group thing

1324.629 --> 1330.33
going that's necessarily like really Eve

1327.119 --> 1332.48
or criminal but just more like we are

1330.33 --> 1335.1899999999998
the guys and they see someone like me

1332.48 --> 1337.559
then they will make a remark about it

1335.19 --> 1341.46
like maybe you laugh a little but

1337.559 --> 1344.1789999999999
they'll never like actually walk up to

1341.46 --> 1348.259
me and try to get in my face like never

1344.179 --> 1351.3890000000001
happen while looking like this ever in

1348.259 --> 1354.1390000000001
pretty big groups I like even walk

1351.389 --> 1357.869
straight through them and I genuinely

1354.139 --> 1361.289
like smile like yeah it's alright you

1357.869 --> 1365.759
know I respect you but I also respect

1361.289 --> 1370.799
myself and yeah I'm just very confident

1365.759 --> 1373.1100000000001
and it works so yeah some kinds of

1370.799 --> 1377.399
things I can do with this and I am doing

1373.11 --> 1380.2199999999998
with it and it's probably more I could

1377.399 --> 1382.4089999999999
do but I probably wouldn't shouldn't do

1380.22 --> 1383.999
and I'm not going to do with that type

1382.409 --> 1386.49
of image because I don't want to ruin

1383.999 --> 1393.23
what I'm building and I don't want to

1386.49 --> 1393.23
stray from the path but yeah it's funny

1394.309 --> 1409.1589999999999
you says I look like again stuff you do

1399.33 --> 1409.1589999999999
not like I doubt really me how do I I'm

1411.74 --> 1414.76
I don't know

1420.58 --> 1427.33
Yeah right oh yeah this is hilarious

1423.61 --> 1429.3999999999999
controls out there right yeah I'm a nerd

1427.33 --> 1434.62
I can't beat up yeah you know what let

1429.4 --> 1436.93
me continue the story I did when I was a

1434.62 --> 1441.9099999999999
little kid get that kind of [ __ ]

1436.93 --> 1446.91
yep but as I said as soon as I started

1441.91 --> 1450.16
to go the wrong way and expanding them

1446.91 --> 1453.1200000000001
I'd started out pretty much self defense

1450.16 --> 1456.39
because yeah I've been bullied and [ __ ]

1453.12 --> 1460.36
or a big part of my youth and that

1456.39 --> 1463.7800000000002
really in a bad way neurotically shaped

1460.36 --> 1465.9699999999998
me because I was always expecting people

1463.78 --> 1468.55
to do that because that's how the world

1465.97 --> 1470.64
seemed to respond to me and I yeah

1468.55 --> 1473.59
couldn't step away from it I couldn't

1470.64 --> 1476.1100000000001
disbelieve that it would be different so

1473.59 --> 1479.28
I was very suspicious paranoid towards

1476.11 --> 1484.6499999999999
groups of people and in the Gaussian I

1479.28 --> 1489.34
basically overcame that by learning to

1484.65 --> 1491.0800000000002
scare the [ __ ] out of people not having

1489.34 --> 1495.76
to get in a fight but just saying things

1491.08 --> 1497.6499999999999
that are really creepy to them and you

1495.76 --> 1500.34
have to see the opportunity to do that

1497.65 --> 1502.8100000000002
and then just scare them off

1500.34 --> 1506.1399999999999
psychologically that was like at the

1502.81 --> 1507.8799999999999
self defense mechanism and I was a lot

1506.14 --> 1512.3200000000002
better at it than I expected at first

1507.88 --> 1521.7700000000002
and it's not healthy to do that but it

1512.32 --> 1525.58
does work and yeah after that I've never

1521.77 --> 1530.53
been really pushed or touched in a

1525.58 --> 1533.77
negative way by people really know maybe

1530.53 --> 1536.32
my the girl friends yeah but that's

1533.77 --> 1539.8
another story of course they look

1536.32 --> 1544.83
through all the facades of course get

1539.8 --> 1551.1399999999999
close to somebody but yeah it helped me

1544.83 --> 1552.33
help me to make a stand for myself in

1551.14 --> 1557.8100000000002
this world

1552.33 --> 1562.29
and I'm glad that I can and by the way I

1557.81 --> 1565.08
could technically drop it drop doing

1562.29 --> 1568.11
this take on another image as it were

1565.08 --> 1570.87
and I'd still be able to manage because

1568.11 --> 1574.9499999999998
my social skills have become so much

1570.87 --> 1577.8899999999999
better than then like back then ten

1574.95 --> 1583.44
years ago more fifteen years ago in the

1577.89 --> 1586.38
doll scene I didn't have a capacity it

1583.44 --> 1593.91
just really elaborately explained things

1586.38 --> 1594.7700000000002
in a way that was properly structure

1593.91 --> 1597.48
Erised

1594.77 --> 1600.66
I'd expressed myself but it would be

1597.48 --> 1603.1200000000001
much more confusing to understand even

1600.66 --> 1606.1200000000001
yeah if you couldn't listen it back to

1603.12 --> 1607.56
it so people were more confused by me by

1606.12 --> 1609.57
infected I mean it was just very hard

1607.56 --> 1611.85
for me to properly communicate on this

1609.57 --> 1614.49
level I had to learn all of this and I

1611.85 --> 1617.8799999999999
didn't really understand why people

1614.49 --> 1620.16
didn't understand me also so was just my

1617.88 --> 1625.16
personal frequency was just too removed

1620.16 --> 1628.0800000000002
from other people and I lacked I

1625.16 --> 1629.94
couldn't apply my empathic abilities

1628.08 --> 1632.61
because of this probably because I just

1629.94 --> 1635.69
didn't get it and that all of that has

1632.61 --> 1639.3899999999999
changed over the years could drastically

1635.69 --> 1641.7
so back then I needed like this defense

1639.39 --> 1643.98
mechanisms to basically defend myself

1641.7 --> 1647.07
and prevent from getting into trouble

1643.98 --> 1649.2
just to get by I don't need it anymore

1647.07 --> 1651.87
and I'd never use it anymore

1649.2 --> 1657.54
too good I don't because it's bad it's

1651.87 --> 1659.7299999999998
negative so I could just drop it and now

1657.54 --> 1662.49
use all the skills that I've gained to

1659.73 --> 1668.99
do everything and I do kind of plan to

1662.49 --> 1672.93
do that but I don't know if I want to

1668.99 --> 1675.81
drop all of this you know to get in kind

1672.93 --> 1676.3500000000001
of like a working set clothes that's

1675.81 --> 1679.56
different

1676.35 --> 1681.9299999999998
like a suit especially if I had a more

1679.56 --> 1683.22
management function then yeah you're not

1681.93 --> 1687.27
gonna walk around

1683.22 --> 1689.43
it's too weird or maybe I would

1687.27 --> 1692.73
who knows maybe would be my thing I

1689.43 --> 1697.13
don't know what I'm gonna do anyway

1692.73 --> 1704.16
let's talk about me and my personal

1697.13 --> 1710.24
conduct society no and there's ace a

1704.16 --> 1714.8300000000002
McKinsey psychic psych six warrior

1710.24 --> 1714.83
Thorson good to see you guys

1722.28 --> 1727.83
look

1724.51 --> 1727.83
okay that's on

1728.9 --> 1735.0600000000002
you'd says you used to be a criminal

1732.41 --> 1736.26
used to know a criminal that looked like

1735.06 --> 1742.44
me

1736.26 --> 1744.48
all right I don't know I bet there's

1742.44 --> 1751.74
more people out there that take on that

1744.48 --> 1756.48
image and that truly do apply the dark

1751.74 --> 1759.75
side of it completely and you'll see it

1756.48 --> 1767.73
on them like you'll see the negativity

1759.75 --> 1770.79
and when I did just dubious stuff I'd

1767.73 --> 1773.25
see it on myself and people I knew would

1770.79 --> 1776.6399999999999
see it on me as well you can see that

1773.25 --> 1780.54
it's like the darkness brings a taint

1776.64 --> 1783.51
and you need to detach from that

1780.54 --> 1788.67
actively and it's not an easy process

1783.51 --> 1790.53
you don't click it away and yeah some

1788.67 --> 1792.8100000000002
people are just really freaking dumb and

1790.53 --> 1796.47
they stubborn and they just keep on

1792.81 --> 1799.4099999999999
doing dark [ __ ] and they get obsessed

1796.47 --> 1802.71
over some weird power related goal and

1799.41 --> 1805.53
they let themselves completely drown in

1802.71 --> 1808.26
the darkness and it radiates of them and

1805.53 --> 1811.92
it poisons them and it changes their

1808.26 --> 1814.59
entire socialized spectrum and yeah

1811.92 --> 1817.8300000000002
that's what happens when you truly walk

1814.59 --> 1824.73
into the darkness so freaking glad I

1817.83 --> 1830.12
never did that so so so glad no then

1824.73 --> 1830.1200000000001
yeah couldn't didn't do that

1835.54 --> 1838.08
nope

1846.38 --> 1861.5800000000002
guys in suits acting wacky you mean like

1851.84 --> 1863.799
business suits then you'll feel right

1861.58 --> 1869.149
well that's funny

1863.799 --> 1871.759
look guys in the suits in general most

1869.149 --> 1873.9189999999999
guys in suits are just part of a

1871.759 --> 1876.919
corporation and that can be dangerous

1873.919 --> 1879.529
and they'll just be a mouthpiece for a

1876.919 --> 1882.0800000000002
certain compartmentalized thing they're

1879.529 --> 1884.149
presenting to you and they'll not tell

1882.08 --> 1887.1789999999999
you all the rest you have to figure that

1884.149 --> 1890.559
out yourself that's what you got to

1887.179 --> 1896.45
beware with people in suits in function

1890.559 --> 1898.399
yeah maybe I guess the people that are

1896.45 --> 1901.3700000000001
really dangerous and suits you just know

1898.399 --> 1905.629
because they are notorious like mega

1901.37 --> 1909.289
corporation executives those type of

1905.629 --> 1911.12
type of people you've seen them they are

1909.289 --> 1922.0
completely corrupted

1911.12 --> 1922.0
they're totally power drunk so yeah okay

1925.57 --> 1930.62
you guys want to see me with my hair

1928.07 --> 1932.629
down or flat tastic wanted to okay yeah

1930.62 --> 1933.4399999999998
you know what that's fine I wanted to do

1932.629 --> 1940.1
that anyway

1933.44 --> 1943.539
so let's just do it does because I did

1940.1 --> 1943.539
really washing

1943.75 --> 1963.21
so I'll just show you this loose it

1951.28 --> 1963.21

1995.99 --> 1999.17
[Music]

2006.369 --> 2014.539
well that's all fine and dandy psychics

2009.169 --> 2018.3690000000001
warrior but I when I put the hair like

2014.539 --> 2021.369
that that works just fine for me

2018.369 --> 2021.369
No

2046.3 --> 2052.84
like it like this and look the issue

2049.16 --> 2056.21
with my hair is it's it's pretty thin so

2052.84 --> 2056.78
that's really the only issue I'm not so

2056.21 --> 2060.02
much

2056.78 --> 2062.3900000000003
balding thank God because it's been like

2060.02 --> 2065.24
this for a very long time as that my

2062.39 --> 2067.58
hair is just thin naturally I

2065.24 --> 2069.52
unfortunately inherited that from my

2067.58 --> 2072.14
mother

2069.52 --> 2077.66
it's nothing you can do about it just

2072.14 --> 2082.04
its genetic but yeah it's I'm still very

2077.66 --> 2085.3999999999996
happy with it seeing friends that yeah

2082.04 --> 2087.02
like blatantly requests in their

2085.4 --> 2089.35
hairline and then eventually they just

2087.02 --> 2091.46
decide to go ball that kind of thing

2089.35 --> 2098.0299999999997
that's never going to happen with me

2091.46 --> 2103.88
thank goodness you know might eventually

2098.03 --> 2110.4100000000003
start to degrade a little more has with

2103.88 --> 2110.4100000000003
my dad but yeah he's like in his 60s Oh

2110.98 --> 2116.2
be at least 20 more years before I get

2113.99 --> 2116.2
there

2121.27 --> 2131.41
Wow okay guys picture gay fantasies do

2128.09 --> 2131.4100000000003
yourself thank you very much

2140.099 --> 2148.6600000000003
to be fair it's nothing new

2143.339 --> 2152.95
especially on Agassi I got hit on by men

2148.66 --> 2155.43
all the time it was flattering in one

2152.95 --> 2158.47
sense and really annoying in the other

2155.43 --> 2167.279
especially the ones that just refused to

2158.47 --> 2167.279
believe that I wasn't gay but yeah we do

2181.14 --> 2185.8799999999997
see

2183.53 --> 2191.2900000000004
we

2185.88 --> 2194.71
IVA now see you so every time you see

2191.29 --> 2199.33
something like that it's literally

2194.71 --> 2201.55
because my hair is just hidden yeah of

2199.33 --> 2204.46
course I have more hair here than I have

2201.55 --> 2213.51
over here I'm not completely unblemished

2204.46 --> 2218.5
and 20 year old okay but if I was

2213.51 --> 2222.9100000000003
holding in the regular sense I'm 38 now

2218.5 --> 2225.88
okay it would not it would be a lot

2222.91 --> 2228.6
worse so just so you know I'm not

2225.88 --> 2228.6
worried about it

2240.669 --> 2248.14
all right oh I'm getting a tip here yeah

2245.959 --> 2257.6299999999997
that I supposed to be cutting it short

2248.14 --> 2260.479
well I do trim it down a little but no

2257.63 --> 2262.549
I'm not gonna cut it short it's terrible

2260.479 --> 2266.769
then it'd have to sit to all of that

2262.549 --> 2270.909
look my hair doesn't grow as quickly as

2266.769 --> 2274.5789999999997
like a person with like the more

2270.909 --> 2277.5190000000002
Mediterranean or African sick curly type

2274.579 --> 2279.9790000000003
hair people that have that type of hair

2277.519 --> 2282.4689999999996
that that hair grows fast and usually

2279.979 --> 2284.1789999999996
they have to shave a lot and all that it

2282.469 --> 2287.989
doesn't go that fast

2284.179 --> 2290.359
so yeah I'm not prepared like oh I might

2287.989 --> 2294.469
potentially be able to get better

2290.359 --> 2297.109
stronger hair I'm now gonna just walk

2294.469 --> 2301.5190000000002
around with really awkward short hair

2297.109 --> 2306.369
for like two months or something no

2301.519 --> 2306.3689999999997
thanks no this is just fine

2312.69 --> 2321.44
anyway how did we wonder off talking

2317.16 --> 2321.44
about my freakin hair it's annoying

2324.2 --> 2328.8289999999997
anyway the show is gonna end in five

2327.059 --> 2331.92
minutes anyway it's it's been a little

2328.829 --> 2334.9100000000003
short because I was slightly late and I

2331.92 --> 2334.91
start sorry about that

2335.9 --> 2350.579
no guests today and that's fine it's

2340.65 --> 2354.42
nice and calm for change yeah

2350.579 --> 2360.059
the Flat Earth debates it's been amusing

2354.42 --> 2363.299
and annoying and it really just seems to

2360.059 --> 2365.809
be like a game attacks with diluted

2363.299 --> 2365.809
ballers and

2370.39 --> 2376.54
are they really defeated only when they

2373.36 --> 2379.33
admit to being defeated because I don't

2376.54 --> 2382.0299999999997
think that's ever gonna happen no matter

2379.33 --> 2385.7799999999997
what I think they'd rather die or be

2382.03 --> 2390.28
locked in an asylum than admit to being

2385.78 --> 2393.19
wrong or have to be told by the

2390.28 --> 2394.75
authorities and yeah maybe even then

2393.19 --> 2397.87
they're just not gonna do it at all

2394.75 --> 2399.82
they're just gonna hold on anyway and we

2397.87 --> 2403.81
defeated them we defeated them so but

2399.82 --> 2405.67
it's just just playing around at this

2403.81 --> 2408.1
point it's playing around like a cat

2405.67 --> 2411.19
plays around with them with a Mac or

2408.1 --> 2417.31
with a mouse you know it's just [ __ ]

2411.19 --> 2420.43
around and I guess also wallowing in

2417.31 --> 2433.7799999999997
victory in a sense it's very comfortable

2420.43 --> 2437.8599999999997
positions what's I don't know I wouldn't

2433.78 --> 2442.4500000000003
be surprised if if this goes on for

2437.86 --> 2445.26
another year and next year you tune in

2442.45 --> 2449.8599999999997
compare it to this year to right now and

2445.26 --> 2452.5600000000004
it would almost literally be the same

2449.86 --> 2456.46
thing that's what I predict might be

2452.56 --> 2459.13
other people we don't know now that are

2456.46 --> 2461.71
gonna be acting exactly that same

2459.13 --> 2466.15
pattern exactly like these chores like

2461.71 --> 2468.01
rumpus like Laurie all these idiots it's

2466.15 --> 2469.63
gonna be exactly the same thing and

2468.01 --> 2471.6400000000003
we're gonna be telling them the exact

2469.63 --> 2473.65
same thing and in between the other Ruby

2471.64 --> 2477.31
of course a little bit more progress

2473.65 --> 2481.83
here and there but slowly because we're

2477.31 --> 2484.0299999999997
already got the big gulp of it I think

2481.83 --> 2487.29
optics and everything we figured most

2484.03 --> 2491.98
things out pointing at the machinations

2487.29 --> 2493.9
but yeah when it comes to interacting

2491.98 --> 2497.94
with the ballers I think it's going to

2493.9 --> 2502.23
be exactly the same exactly the same

2497.94 --> 2507.27
maybe a little worse although I can bear

2502.23 --> 2509.1
imagine it maybe yeah what could be

2507.27 --> 2513.0
worse like people just getting on and

2509.1 --> 2516.66
just starting screaming or just like P

2513.0 --> 2521.49
Mars constantly just pure trolling

2516.66 --> 2526.5
everything but again it only lasts so

2521.49 --> 2530.9399999999996
long so I yeah I don't know but it just

2526.5 --> 2533.07
feels like it's like we're not literally

2530.94 --> 2535.32
making progress with the vollis yeah we

2533.07 --> 2537.51
do get their psychology better we do

2535.32 --> 2541.32
understand how to profile them better

2537.51 --> 2543.6000000000004
for ourselves psychologically but they

2541.32 --> 2546.42
themselves are just not making progress

2543.6 --> 2549.15
in the slightest they are completely

2546.42 --> 2551.1
stuck and grained in their stuck pattern

2549.15 --> 2553.71
and I'm not getting out and they don't

2551.1 --> 2557.19
want to get out they really really don't

2553.71 --> 2560.28
want but I don't think they will ever

2557.19 --> 2562.8
want to the people that we deal with

2560.28 --> 2565.1000000000004
they might walk away and other people

2562.8 --> 2571.5600000000004
will just take over exactly the same

2565.1 --> 2574.74
same patterns anyway hey Randy thanks

2571.56 --> 2577.5

2574.74 --> 2583.8799999999997
