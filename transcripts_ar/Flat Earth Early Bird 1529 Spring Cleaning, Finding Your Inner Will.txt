68.06 --> 75.24000000000001
welcome to Flat Earth early bird number

71.54 --> 76.799
1529 I'm your host Arwin and before we

75.24 --> 79.38
start the show please don't forget to

76.799 --> 82.08000000000001
share it on any platform you theme fit

79.38 --> 83.759
and if you haven't already subscribe to

82.08 --> 86.759
my channel and hit the Bell notification

83.759 --> 89.22
so you know when I'm going live which is

86.759 --> 91.86
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in weekdays

89.22 --> 94.08
and 2PM Amsterdam time in a weekend and

91.86 --> 96.0
please also do support me through the

94.08 --> 98.46
PayPal patreon and membership system

96.0 --> 100.979
join button that'll be much appreciated

98.46 --> 103.19999999999999
and yeah I can definitely use the

100.979 --> 105.06
support guys

103.2 --> 106.68
it's been a while

105.06 --> 109.56
so

106.68 --> 112.02000000000001
support would be great through PayPal if

109.56 --> 114.18
all possible specifically anyway the

112.02 --> 117.72
weather today is

114.18 --> 120.54
I don't know it's just changing around

117.72 --> 124.14
sometimes it's a bit clear sky then it

120.54 --> 126.47900000000001
all clouds up it rained not too long ago

124.14 --> 129.86
like half an hour ago looks like it

126.479 --> 129.85999999999999
might go raining again

130.02 --> 132.86
so

142.319 --> 146.17999999999998
it's not super dark or anything

149.22 --> 154.04
it's not all fogged up it's just clouds

151.44 --> 154.04
moving around

156.78 --> 163.26
anyway for some reason this is Extreme

159.72 --> 165.8
contrast Happening Here

163.26 --> 165.79999999999998
just

165.84 --> 173.519
yeah whatever

168.68 --> 176.84
it it's not that bad anyway hello Slifer

173.519 --> 176.84
first in chat

177.84 --> 184.94
uh yeah what country am I from again

181.8 --> 184.94
the Netherlands

186.959 --> 190.81900000000002
I've been to Denmark once

193.58 --> 198.84
I did not care much for it

196.92 --> 200.879
although yeah we went there because of

198.84 --> 203.76
Legoland and I wanted that

200.879 --> 205.44
that was sort of fun except that we

203.76 --> 208.019
couldn't buy anything because it was a

205.44 --> 211.099
way too expensive so

208.019 --> 211.09900000000002
it's just

216.84 --> 223.70000000000002
and I mean it's also freaking

220.68 --> 223.70000000000002
boring looking

223.739 --> 228.42000000000002
it's like just a lot of grassland

225.9 --> 230.76000000000002
everywhere

228.42 --> 232.2
and like I thought I thought like oh

230.76 --> 234.72
well the Netherlands is kind of like

232.2 --> 237.5
that well no I mean it's much worse in

234.72 --> 237.5
Denmark actually

237.72 --> 240.319
anyway

241.56 --> 245.78
half German half Italian okay

248.76 --> 253.28
so

249.78 --> 253.28
do you live in Denmark

253.379 --> 255.92
's life

264.06 --> 268.8
right whatever anyway

266.52 --> 271.08
uh

268.8 --> 272.6
yeah

271.08 --> 275.69899999999996
got in

272.6 --> 277.97900000000004
Illuminati croissant here

275.699 --> 280.16
definitely looking forward to eating

277.979 --> 280.15999999999997
that

289.52 --> 294.25899999999996
you you live in your town Italy okay

298.919 --> 302.65999999999997
all right cool

305.94 --> 309.12
what

307.5 --> 312.66
uh

309.12 --> 312.66
hello nd-s-o

312.9 --> 317.17999999999995
I can see you you're not blocked so

322.32 --> 326.039
right anyhow

327.199 --> 333.36
yeah went to bed pretty early today or

330.9 --> 335.46
yesterday night

333.36 --> 337.62
for my doing is better

335.46 --> 339.479
need to do that even more

337.62 --> 343.02
hey Amanda Young

339.479 --> 344.82
Taylor Vision good to see you

343.02 --> 347.35999999999996
toast and peanut butter with orange

344.82 --> 350.15999999999997
juice nice

347.36 --> 352.38
I could get some orange juice too I

350.16 --> 355.02000000000004
still have some I mean I've been keeping

352.38 --> 357.06
that for months but it was still just

355.02 --> 359.52
perfect

357.06 --> 362.639
blood orange juice like the red stuff

359.52 --> 365.039
which is much healthier than regular

362.639 --> 366.96000000000004
orange juice by the way but it tastes

365.039 --> 369.38
different not everybody likes it I do

366.96 --> 369.38
like it

370.139 --> 372.919
but uh

380.639 --> 385.319
yeah title of the show

383.22 --> 386.03900000000004
spring cleaning fighting your inner

385.319 --> 388.44
wheel

386.039 --> 390.59999999999997
it's just something that I'm focusing on

388.44 --> 392.21999999999997
a lot it's probably hanging in the air

390.6 --> 394.819
more people are going to have that

392.22 --> 394.819
impulse

395.58 --> 401.639
so I thought I'd bring it up as a

397.86 --> 404.1
subject but it was also again

401.639 --> 407.72
looking into the thermosphere looking

404.1 --> 407.72
through it on Wikipedia

410.759 --> 413.47900000000004
and

419.16 --> 425.52000000000004
there's just no mention whatsoever as to

421.919 --> 430.21999999999997
actual examples of

425.52 --> 430.21999999999997
how it was locally measured

430.319 --> 434.88
okay come up this has come up before

432.36 --> 437.34000000000003
like there is this sort of like a radar

434.88 --> 439.38
station but it isn't radar a measuring

437.34 --> 442.52
thing from the ground

439.38 --> 445.5
where they can kind of like

442.52 --> 449.15999999999997
spectroscopy at a distance but nothing

445.5 --> 450.9
like it by the way but Jake reading

449.16 --> 453.24
temperatures they can read temperatures

450.9 --> 455.81899999999996
at a distance with that thing and they

453.24 --> 458.58
claim to aim it up there and then

455.819 --> 462.12
measure it to be that temperature

458.58 --> 467.52
and that seems to be the only reference

462.12 --> 471.5
of anything remotely empirical to affirm

467.52 --> 471.5
that there is this temperature there

473.759 --> 479.039
and it's just miraculous how little

476.039 --> 482.12
attention there is for this entire this

479.039 --> 482.12
thing entirely I mean

484.8 --> 490.699
I'd like to discuss it

487.139 --> 490.699
if anybody's interested

491.46 --> 496.19899999999996
right but

493.74 --> 498.72
in the meantime yeah spring cleaning

496.199 --> 504.46000000000004
cleaning up your house then you can

498.72 --> 507.92
clean up your in our minds as well

504.46 --> 507.91999999999996
[Music]

508.56 --> 512.539
like dust off the the winter

513.0 --> 517.7
and start tapping into that spring

515.399 --> 517.7
energy

519.0 --> 522.44
it's a lot of enthusiasm

524.58 --> 529.339
thoughts on the Observer or perspective

539.7 --> 546.36
well Taylor Vision I think that that's

542.64 --> 546.36
purely conceptual

546.48 --> 549.14
it's

551.279 --> 553.9399999999999
ugh

556.26 --> 560.519
but what I have thought about also

558.42 --> 563.24
relating to that like oh this fourth

560.519 --> 563.24
dimension like

568.56 --> 574.279
maybe the fourth dimension is just

570.959 --> 576.66
Spirit but it's not

574.279 --> 579.24
dimensional as in

576.66 --> 581.5799999999999
but in a way it is it's like a sub

579.24 --> 583.5
Dimension right information is a

581.58 --> 587.279
substance

583.5 --> 590.12
but it only exists within Consciousness

587.279 --> 590.12
basically

592.44 --> 596.58
so yeah you could argue either

594.12 --> 598.82
Consciousness is the fourth dimension

596.58 --> 598.82
then

598.92 --> 605.88
or the Consciousness takes place within

602.82 --> 607.58
the dimension of information

605.88 --> 609.42
I mean if you're gonna go and

607.58 --> 611.339
conceptualize some kind of other

609.42 --> 614.279
dimension

611.339 --> 617.36
from a physics standpoint that is the

614.279 --> 617.36
route I would take it

640.94 --> 647.1
yeah but anyway look all these

643.68 --> 649.68
comparisons is all just based on all 3D

647.1 --> 653.3000000000001
perspective on a 2d thing

649.68 --> 657.019
and just mathematically

653.3 --> 657.019
fractalizing that concept

657.12 --> 662.22
right but it's mathematical it its real

659.76 --> 664.76
origin is that it is a mathematical

662.22 --> 664.76
trick

667.2 --> 674.6
right there's no

670.14 --> 674.6
fourth spatial dimension

683.399 --> 688.56
I mean there's a lot of mathematically

685.459 --> 690.3
extrapolated conceptions on what it

688.56 --> 692.279
would be like based on the difference

690.3 --> 695.06
between 3D and 2D and then

692.279 --> 698.9399999999999
mathematically fractally

695.06 --> 700.8
exploiting that conception

698.94 --> 703.2790000000001
see do you understand what I mean

700.8 --> 703.279
television

705.899 --> 709.2
chickens have to move their heads back

707.7 --> 711.62
and forth to see the third that's

709.2 --> 711.62
hilarious

714.959 --> 719.399
but it's not technically true though

716.76 --> 722.16
they do see the third dimension site is

719.399 --> 724.56
of the third dimension always

722.16 --> 726.3
anything else is mathematically

724.56 --> 728.779
conceived

726.3 --> 728.779
okay

729.0 --> 736.62
but in order for chickens to see depth

733.079 --> 739.26
they need to move back and forth

736.62 --> 741.66
to see the difference in order to

739.26 --> 743.76
estimate better the position of

741.66 --> 746.18
something in their site that's what's

743.76 --> 746.18
going on

752.76 --> 756.62
right all right television cool

756.68 --> 759.7099999999999
[Music]

761.42 --> 765.66
right but you gotta realize that

763.86 --> 768.3000000000001
generally like the whole thing of

765.66 --> 772.68
dimensionality

768.3 --> 774.8389999999999
oh this is one dimension zero dimension

772.68 --> 778.16
second dimension but the third dimension

774.839 --> 781.62
is real that that is basic it's all just

778.16 --> 783.66
mathematical conception right

781.62 --> 785.579
that whole thing is rooted in

783.66 --> 789.0
mathematical conception

785.579 --> 790.8599999999999
you have to keep track of that

789.0 --> 794.18
to see the difference

790.86 --> 794.1800000000001
it's not a

795.899 --> 801.12
like an esoteric root it's a

799.26 --> 803.459
mathematical root

801.12 --> 806.399
there's no

803.459 --> 810.54
real things you can learn

806.399 --> 811.98
that fit in your real experiences that

810.54 --> 816.36
you can learn from it because it's math

811.98 --> 816.36
it only shows patterns

820.2 --> 824.48
like comparing patterns but

825.3 --> 829.6999999999999
it's a dead end it really is

832.98 --> 838.32
just gotta realize what is out there and

835.68 --> 841.079
then try to identify it and compare it

838.32 --> 844.2
and put it into a logical framework with

841.079 --> 846.959
the rest of it I'm doing that

844.2 --> 850.5600000000001
right I'm attempting it by saying yeah

846.959 --> 853.88
information itself might potentially be

850.56 --> 853.88
the fourth dimension

853.92 --> 859.1999999999999
because there's no trace of it yet it

856.56 --> 860.5189999999999
very pronouncedly exists through our

859.2 --> 863.839
consciousness

860.519 --> 866.399
so you could argue or bicker

863.839 --> 868.6800000000001
we don't know Consciousness is the

866.399 --> 871.32
fourth dimension or

868.68 --> 872.3599999999999
well no but Consciousness is the thing

871.32 --> 874.98
that

872.36 --> 877.92
interacts with the information it's like

874.98 --> 880.5
another site so there is a field a

877.92 --> 882.18
another thing a dimension

880.5 --> 886.04
and it's not the Consciousness the

882.18 --> 886.04
Consciousness takes place there

886.44 --> 892.98
it interacts with that other dimension

889.62 --> 895.519
so yeah arguably fourth dimension would

892.98 --> 895.519
be information

898.6 --> 901.799
[Music]

902.279 --> 909.199
but it's not spatial

905.16 --> 909.199
it's not a dimension on top

910.139 --> 914.94
it's like a parallel

912.839 --> 918.12
dimension

914.94 --> 920.7600000000001
you could also try to connect it up as

918.12 --> 922.68
an idea say like no that's like the

920.76 --> 925.74
astral plane

922.68 --> 927.54
plane of pure spirit and ideas and

925.74 --> 929.699
information or something or you could

927.54 --> 931.56
say no it's akashic record the akashic

929.699 --> 933.4799999999999
record is the fourth dimension right

931.56 --> 935.459
it's all kinds of directions you can

933.48 --> 938.3000000000001
train you can take this train of

935.459 --> 938.3
thinking in

939.72 --> 945.6600000000001
but there is a grounded root that's not

943.98 --> 947.88
just mathematics

945.66 --> 950.399
it's experimentation empirical

947.88 --> 951.6
experimentation information is a

950.399 --> 955.199
substance

951.6 --> 957.6800000000001
yet it only exists through our

955.199 --> 957.68
consciousness

958.86 --> 963.839
but it is there and it even has a

961.68 --> 966.62
physical influence

963.839 --> 966.62
in that sense

968.1 --> 971.0600000000001
through experiment

972.26 --> 977.8199999999999
right so yeah are we might be

975.48 --> 979.32
discovering the actual fourth dimension

977.82 --> 983.0600000000001
here

979.32 --> 983.0600000000001
grounded in empiricism

983.1 --> 988.279
nobody cares whatever

985.68 --> 988.279
hmm

1006.5 --> 1009.279
what

1011.779 --> 1015.639
hello steamy Traveler

1016.399 --> 1022.759
could different types of information

1019.839 --> 1025.4
correspond to individual and different

1022.759 --> 1027.6200000000001
dimensions

1025.4 --> 1031.0
true information a different dimension

1027.62 --> 1031.0
from false information no

1037.579 --> 1040.72
it's just information

1043.22 --> 1050.6200000000001
and conception of true or false those

1047.179 --> 1050.6200000000001
are things of intent

1053.72 --> 1059.1200000000001
right an intent

1056.559 --> 1061.82
is none

1059.12 --> 1064.84
yeah it's part of the Consciousness it's

1061.82 --> 1064.84
part of the action

1071.539 --> 1077.0
where do you draw them from

1074.059 --> 1080.3799999999999
where do you draw the ideas from well

1077.0 --> 1080.38
from the akashic library

1080.919 --> 1087.0800000000002
God's manifest of all ideas

1084.38 --> 1090.2600000000002
or for like forever

1087.08 --> 1091.76
like if not even just ideas it's just

1090.26 --> 1096.2
the

1091.76 --> 1100.78
The Logical framework for how

1096.2 --> 1100.78
reason can even move

1105.799 --> 1111.32
I just believe there is a akashic record

1109.22 --> 1114.559
all information is there and everything

1111.32 --> 1118.6
we do is derived from it that's it is

1114.559 --> 1118.6
basically the source of our cognition

1124.28 --> 1131.66
without the akashic record we would

1126.86 --> 1131.6599999999999
probably be much more animal-like

1132.43 --> 1134.799
[Music]

1132.799 --> 1134.799
um

1138.2 --> 1144.38
although yeah without the ability to tap

1141.62 --> 1146.6599999999999
into it without that connection we'd

1144.38 --> 1148.94
become more animal-like

1146.66 --> 1152.74
I mean some people can't tap into it and

1148.94 --> 1152.74
they'll probably be more animal-like

1159.679 --> 1165.2
right but the akashic record is just

1162.5 --> 1167.0
there it's just there it's there to be

1165.2 --> 1170.539
stumbled upon

1167.0 --> 1174.679
or to be dug into

1170.539 --> 1176.9
right it's just can you handle it

1174.679 --> 1178.52
can you process the information and then

1176.9 --> 1179.9
if you're able to process the

1178.52 --> 1182.44
information can you handle the

1179.9 --> 1182.44
implication

1182.72 --> 1188.919
and the shift that happens to you when

1185.78 --> 1188.9189999999999
you attain the information

1189.02 --> 1193.1
because

1190.34 --> 1197.72
real big insights tend to separate you

1193.1 --> 1201.4599999999998
from your social entanglements

1197.72 --> 1201.46
and the way that functions for you

1204.38 --> 1211.4
it's all there right the truth

1207.98 --> 1215.5
God's connection it's all right there

1211.4 --> 1215.5
it's always been just right there

1216.38 --> 1221.38
either something in you blocked you from

1218.72 --> 1221.38
attaining it

1225.32 --> 1230.6
or you just

1228.08 --> 1233.1789999999999
you didn't recognize it for what it

1230.6 --> 1235.76
really was it's like or yeah you can't

1233.179 --> 1238.9
handle it you hate it naturally it's the

1235.76 --> 1238.9
ego inside because

1239.059 --> 1244.52
it just some people just realized

1241.88 --> 1246.44
through such interface it's like through

1244.52 --> 1248.179
contact with God they just realize that

1246.44 --> 1250.4
they are not God

1248.179 --> 1252.6200000000001
that they're not in control at all they

1250.4 --> 1254.299
realize the true challenge through

1252.62 --> 1257.1789999999999
Consciousness and that is very

1254.299 --> 1258.62
burdensome and they hate it so they

1257.179 --> 1262.1000000000001
resent

1258.62 --> 1264.1399999999999
the thing that confronts them with those

1262.1 --> 1266.6
those realizations that bring the bad

1264.14 --> 1268.96
feelings so they resent it they resent

1266.6 --> 1268.9599999999998
God

1269.0 --> 1273.7
and they deny it and they cut themselves

1271.4 --> 1273.7
off

1276.919 --> 1280.7800000000002
all happens internally

1320.12 --> 1324.2199999999998
frankly arrogant what

1329.36 --> 1332.1999999999998
what do you mean

1344.539 --> 1350.3799999999999
a diagnostic system can even be clung to

1357.919 --> 1364.48
well I think that

1359.9 --> 1364.48
like lasting and not agnostics

1366.26 --> 1371.84
they basically just don't really want to

1369.5 --> 1374.36
know they want to stay

1371.84 --> 1376.34
on the fence

1374.36 --> 1378.86
spiritually that's what I think real

1376.34 --> 1381.3799999999999
agnosticism is

1378.86 --> 1385.12
is just you constantly get information

1381.38 --> 1387.6200000000001
from both sides and you just refuse to

1385.12 --> 1390.34
to pin anything down

1387.62 --> 1390.34
for yourself

1390.559 --> 1395.98
so it is basically stubbornness and in

1393.26 --> 1395.98
unwillingness

1397.4 --> 1401.96
which could be driven by fear

1400.28 --> 1404.32
afraid that you might choose something

1401.96 --> 1404.32
wrong

1408.38 --> 1413.5390000000002
but I mean there's also agnostics out

1410.48 --> 1416.0
there that just they're agnostic because

1413.539 --> 1418.28
that's the most tactical thing to say in

1416.0 --> 1420.919
response when somebody tries to inquire

1418.28 --> 1423.74
on that level because you just don't

1420.919 --> 1427.2990000000002
want to have anything to do with that

1423.74 --> 1427.299
entire field of thinking

1431.84 --> 1436.6399999999999
right

1433.52 --> 1438.26
not all agnostics are like oh yeah oh

1436.64 --> 1440.0
we're going to talk about agnosticism

1438.26 --> 1442.28
today

1440.0 --> 1444.32
unlike a Daily Show

1442.28 --> 1446.78
it's all about agnostics like yeah no

1444.32 --> 1448.8799999999999
that's because people that I've come

1446.78 --> 1450.6789999999999
across typically choose to be agnostic

1448.88 --> 1453.5590000000002
because they just don't want to have

1450.679 --> 1455.0
anything to do with that at all

1453.559 --> 1459.5
with God

1455.0 --> 1462.039
or counter God or anything like that

1459.5 --> 1462.039
foreign

1472.159 --> 1477.919
I mean people pick and choose their

1475.64 --> 1480.0800000000002
fields of operation

1477.919 --> 1481.039
where they can function and whether they

1480.08 --> 1483.32
like

1481.039 --> 1486.26
take a challenge of like overcoming

1483.32 --> 1488.6
something that they naturally don't like

1486.26 --> 1490.84
or they choose to just avoid it bypass

1488.6 --> 1490.84
it

1494.0 --> 1498.26
I've bypassed things that in retrospect

1496.64 --> 1501.3200000000002
I'm very sorry about but then again

1498.26 --> 1505.22
every time I go back

1501.32 --> 1507.2
it's like yeah I but I really couldn't

1505.22 --> 1509.78
pick those other things

1507.2 --> 1513.3400000000001
I just did not have that in me it's like

1509.78 --> 1513.34
I was all tangled up I

1513.5 --> 1518.299
I didn't have a grasp and oversight over

1516.02 --> 1522.6399999999999
how things work I was basically all too

1518.299 --> 1522.6399999999999
preoccupied with my internal struggles

1526.22 --> 1532.46
and trying to find inspiration

1529.58 --> 1535.46
to like get out of where I was stuck at

1532.46 --> 1535.46
psychologically

1536.9 --> 1541.72
I spend a lot of time in my life in that

1539.48 --> 1541.72
state

1560.659 --> 1566.44
right but yeah now I try to avoid it

1566.919 --> 1571.48
there's still just a lot of things that

1573.799 --> 1579.52
there's times where I just seriously

1575.72 --> 1579.52
wish I was different in ways like

1582.08 --> 1584.3799999999999
oh

1588.38 --> 1593.7990000000002
to just not have so many obstructions

1590.779 --> 1593.799
but still energy

1596.0 --> 1600.94
then the obstructions I mean

1597.62 --> 1600.9399999999998
obstructions from the inside

1602.419 --> 1606.3200000000002
I mean the obstructions in the outside

1604.4 --> 1608.179
world against me are gonna be what

1606.32 --> 1612.1399999999999
they're gonna be anyway it really

1608.179 --> 1615.0800000000002
doesn't matter what state I am at

1612.14 --> 1617.659
it's always been roughly the same and I

1615.08 --> 1620.059
either would completely overestimate it

1617.659 --> 1621.98
or underestimate it

1620.059 --> 1626.299
my problem was always I couldn't just

1621.98 --> 1629.179
let it be it's like Arwin why can't you

1626.299 --> 1632.12
just accept that the [ __ ] world is

1629.179 --> 1633.5
[ __ ] up and let it [ __ ] be and do

1632.12 --> 1636.8799999999999
your thing

1633.5 --> 1639.679
and like don't give a [ __ ]

1636.88 --> 1642.44
and that's secretly

1639.679 --> 1643.88
take it all upon you to like oh but it

1642.44 --> 1646.159
must change and then make yourself

1643.88 --> 1648.3200000000002
miserable

1646.159 --> 1650.7990000000002
so that you just can't do what you just

1648.32 --> 1650.799
need to do

1658.7 --> 1663.64
it has been a problem for me since I was

1660.98 --> 1663.64
a young teen

1665.48 --> 1672.14
and it was a real problem because I even

1668.539 --> 1675.86
like got therapy and all that

1672.14 --> 1679.7
it's like assertivity therapy in a way

1675.86 --> 1681.9189999999999
it just wouldn't set root I was such so

1679.7 --> 1683.0
stuck in a defensive mode where it's

1681.919 --> 1684.7990000000002
just like

1683.0 --> 1687.26
basically

1684.799 --> 1690.32
like I thought that the entire world was

1687.26 --> 1692.84
like savagely evil really

1690.32 --> 1697.48
in ways and I couldn't accept that so I

1692.84 --> 1697.48
just cut myself stuck in a denial Loop

1697.58 --> 1703.539
to escape from dreaded realizations

1700.7 --> 1703.539
about the world

1704.6 --> 1707.8999999999999
and it was stuck there for a very long

1706.7 --> 1710.0
time

1707.9 --> 1711.679
and space was in there like when you're

1710.0 --> 1714.08
in that state you draw in anything

1711.679 --> 1716.3600000000001
everything that's

1714.08 --> 1718.82
dreamy

1716.36 --> 1722.059
and takes you away

1718.82 --> 1724.84
from regular reality

1722.059 --> 1724.84
fantasies

1728.659 --> 1733.0
which part of my life was the most

1730.58 --> 1733.0
productive

1734.48 --> 1738.82
the time when I had a huge amount of

1736.58 --> 1738.82
money

1742.22 --> 1749.44
even though I was completely messed up

1745.76 --> 1749.44
in ways on the inside

1750.38 --> 1753.98
because when I have money I don't have

1752.24 --> 1755.659
to worry I don't have to be like oh I

1753.98 --> 1758.3600000000001
have to watch every freaking sense I'm

1755.659 --> 1760.3990000000001
gonna literally not do anything

1758.36 --> 1762.799
like I have been doing for quite a while

1760.399 --> 1764.84
I mean I don't have a social life at all

1762.799 --> 1767.6589999999999
like zero

1764.84 --> 1771.039
and I'm like

1767.659 --> 1771.0390000000002
starting to object

1778.1 --> 1784.1
because in that time when I had money I

1780.86 --> 1786.08
wasn't like embarrassed about myself and

1784.1 --> 1788.539
I would just like go around and

1786.08 --> 1790.8799999999999
basically like oh bump into people bump

1788.539 --> 1794.059
into women

1790.88 --> 1797.72
it's like yeah [ __ ] it I'm just doing it

1794.059 --> 1800.44
whatever man like I'm finally just doing

1797.72 --> 1803.179
something just actually

1800.44 --> 1806.24
applying the talent just instead of just

1803.179 --> 1808.159
[ __ ] internalizing and theorizing my

1806.24 --> 1810.98
entire [ __ ] life not accomplishing

1808.159 --> 1814.1200000000001
anything but structure in in the

1810.98 --> 1814.1200000000001
freaking fourth dimension

1821.919 --> 1827.8400000000001
good to see you

1825.2 --> 1830.24
foreign

1827.84 --> 1833.4189999999999
so yeah that part of my life was the

1830.24 --> 1836.8990000000001
most productive and well yeah productive

1833.419 --> 1839.72
is a big word but it had I was extremely

1836.899 --> 1841.82
artistic and creative always trying to

1839.72 --> 1844.1000000000001
make things right but it was just stuck

1841.82 --> 1848.299
to that fourth dimension all the time

1844.1 --> 1850.8799999999999
always just like drank with my head in a

1848.299 --> 1852.32
video game even when I wasn't playing I

1850.88 --> 1855.0800000000002
would just be thinking about the video

1852.32 --> 1857.059
game seeing it and then imagining things

1855.08 --> 1859.1789999999999
about it dreaming about it dreaming

1857.059 --> 1862.22
alterations

1859.179 --> 1865.3990000000001
unexpected changes and then having that

1862.22 --> 1867.679
like really fascination with it and then

1865.399 --> 1869.7199999999998
trying to draw the dream alterations

1867.679 --> 1873.5590000000002
like I was just trying to manifest

1869.72 --> 1876.3990000000001
dreams that I was having like a lot

1873.559 --> 1876.399
all the time

1882.86 --> 1887.1999999999998
then I meet my ex after yeah after

1895.52 --> 1902.059
but I met I mean I was dating

1899.36 --> 1904.82
pretty elaborately

1902.059 --> 1909.82
for my doing anyway

1904.82 --> 1909.82
in that time after my inheritance so

1936.44 --> 1942.94
but I mean

1939.08 --> 1942.9399999999998
I was looking in the wrong way

1947.059 --> 1950.62
looking for the wrong things

1950.779 --> 1955.34
[ __ ] around

1952.64 --> 1958.3990000000001
also like morally psychologically or

1955.34 --> 1962.6789999999999
morally not too far I was still

1958.399 --> 1962.6789999999999
like I don't do actual dark [ __ ]

1963.5 --> 1968.299
only if I'm like really [ __ ]

1966.02 --> 1970.1
frightened

1968.299 --> 1971.72
you like it being cornered or something

1970.1 --> 1973.1
by people

1971.72 --> 1975.74
physically

1973.1 --> 1978.02
and then I might go into really sick

1975.74 --> 1980.179
dark [ __ ]

1978.02 --> 1982.6399999999999
but

1980.179 --> 1985.5800000000002
no with girlfriends I

1982.64 --> 1988.039
I never like mistreat them like I even

1985.58 --> 1993.559
had regrets

1988.039 --> 1995.179
about how I basically engaged with women

1993.559 --> 1999.799
that

1995.179 --> 2002.5800000000002
I I didn't even want to be with

1999.799 --> 2002.58
not really

2005.44 --> 2009.8200000000002
it's just that I guess maybe that sort

2008.14 --> 2011.98
of narcissism where it's just like no

2009.82 --> 2014.5
they were really into me and I just like

2011.98 --> 2017.279
I really loved it when somebody was

2014.5 --> 2017.279
really into me

2017.74 --> 2022.14
but then eventually I kind of got sick

2019.779 --> 2022.14
of it

2025.48 --> 2031.2
of that person and yeah and then

2028.96 --> 2033.519
having to push them away and then

2031.2 --> 2035.5
noticing that they are really like

2033.519 --> 2037.8990000000001
heartbroken about it and that's like

2035.5 --> 2042.659
make me feel really [ __ ] bad about

2037.899 --> 2042.6589999999999
myself like because I was sloppy

2043.419 --> 2050.08
because I was rushing it

2047.2 --> 2052.7200000000003
or basically like just doing something

2050.08 --> 2055.119
right of just doing things and then

2052.72 --> 2057.6589999999997
ended up hurting people and then that

2055.119 --> 2057.659
kind of like

2058.06 --> 2062.04
made me feel really guilty and

2065.32 --> 2068.0800000000004
tougher

2066.76 --> 2069.639
I

2068.08 --> 2074.02
yeah

2069.639 --> 2076.839
but on the long run I did learn

2074.02 --> 2080.02
it was like experimentation with dating

2076.839 --> 2082.24
and I did learn from it

2080.02 --> 2084.099
I mean all those mistakes that I made

2082.24 --> 2086.859
back then I definitely wouldn't make

2084.099 --> 2090.28
those mistakes now

2086.859 --> 2092.639
I'm not completely clumsy I'm just kind

2090.28 --> 2092.639
of weird

2100.54 --> 2103.54
anyway

2116.74 --> 2122.3999999999996
but yeah money does give me confidence

2119.38 --> 2122.4
it does

2127.359 --> 2133.839
I mean you guys could have probably

2130.72 --> 2135.7599999999998
figured that out just by watching my

2133.839 --> 2139.48
show and when I get

2135.76 --> 2143.44
donations like that literally palpably

2139.48 --> 2147.46
changes the energy influx I get

2143.44 --> 2149.8
it just does which is like

2147.46 --> 2153.2200000000003
highly ironic

2149.8 --> 2155.6400000000003
since I basically denounce money in many

2153.22 --> 2155.64
ways

2161.4 --> 2166.619
do you know any cheats for balls get no

2173.68 --> 2176.0989999999997
oh

2176.38 --> 2178.8
my God

2180.52 --> 2186.599
now I mean that that game barely runs on

2183.88 --> 2186.599
my computer anyway

2189.16 --> 2196.3199999999997
and I don't find it super interesting so

2191.619 --> 2196.32
no I don't know much about that game

2204.04 --> 2210.2799999999997
it seemed like a crossover between

2207.04 --> 2214.7799999999997
Dragon Age and never winter nights and

2210.28 --> 2217.1800000000003
but just very slow and buggy and and

2214.78 --> 2220.2000000000003
incomplete oh my God how freaking

2217.18 --> 2220.2
incomplete man

2222.64 --> 2228.0
it's just one freaking piece of terrain

2228.88 --> 2233.82
and it's not even Baldur's Gate it's so

2231.52 --> 2233.82
stupid

2240.46 --> 2243.2400000000002
foreign

2247.8 --> 2251.099
ER Sage

2271.48 --> 2274.079
foreign

2274.48 --> 2279.88
I'm a game designer yeah but I don't

2277.0 --> 2283.619
have any games yet

2279.88 --> 2283.619
are out there on my name

2287.079 --> 2294.3590000000004
hey singe man

2289.54 --> 2294.359
wow that's early grouchy you say okay

2295.0 --> 2302.079
what's the weather here uh kind of mixed

2299.56 --> 2307.119
a little cloudy

2302.079 --> 2309.28
sometimes a bit clearer and rain

2307.119 --> 2311.2000000000003
but not continually like sometimes it

2309.28 --> 2312.94
rains a little bit and then it just

2311.2 --> 2317.04
clears up again

2312.94 --> 2317.04
and then it goes back clouded

2341.8 --> 2345.0600000000004
game maker

2345.22 --> 2350.16
okay

2347.5 --> 2350.16
what

2357.339 --> 2363.04
right well look on my Commodore 64 yeah

2360.52 --> 2366.24
I did actually use a game maker of some

2363.04 --> 2366.24
sort also to make a game

2367.72 --> 2372.22
and dude I made like a giant amount of

2370.06 --> 2374.38
boulder dash levels

2372.22 --> 2376.359
but that stuff is lost it's just

2374.38 --> 2378.94
something that I made and put on some

2376.359 --> 2381.2799999999997
floppy disk I don't even know if that

2378.94 --> 2383.5
still works

2381.28 --> 2386.079
or if it's like thrown away or I have no

2383.5 --> 2388.66
idea or stashed somewhere

2386.079 --> 2390.6400000000003
so I technically don't have anything

2388.66 --> 2393.52
but I was doing

2390.64 --> 2396.7799999999997
things making games all the time

2393.52 --> 2396.78
most of my youth

2400.839 --> 2407.52
I still have entire blueprints

2403.839 --> 2407.52
for games that could be made

2416.68 --> 2419.52
foreign

2447.94 --> 2451.8
Martin is full of [ __ ] I know

2452.22 --> 2456.06
it just makes up stuff

2457.359 --> 2462.66
but I can usually spot when he's just

2459.82 --> 2462.6600000000003
making up stuff

2476.26 --> 2481.079
but anyway welcome back

2478.599 --> 2481.079
hmm

2491.26 --> 2493.32
huh

2498.839 --> 2501.839
thank you

2508.14 --> 2512.56
star water

2510.64 --> 2515.8799999999997
did you hear croissant yeah you're just

2512.56 --> 2515.88
too late I just finished it

2524.38 --> 2531.04
you talking about what are you talking

2527.32 --> 2533.28
about you brought him up right now Andy

2531.04 --> 2533.2799999999997
so

2541.72 --> 2545.339
not Russian vids

2550.06 --> 2557.14
so no we're not talking about RV

2554.339 --> 2562.0789999999997
Cheech McDuck brought up something that

2557.14 --> 2562.0789999999997
he saw over at Martin Luther's Channel

2563.44 --> 2568.96
about some burnt up astronaut and I told

2566.2 --> 2573.0989999999997
him that's probably [ __ ]

2568.96 --> 2576.16
Martin does tend to sometimes just tell

2573.099 --> 2579.2200000000003
complete nonsense stories

2576.16 --> 2581.74
he's just like that

2579.22 --> 2584.319
just make [ __ ] up

2581.74 --> 2586.5
and apparently he checked it and I was

2584.319 --> 2586.5
right

2588.099 --> 2591.1800000000003
he was like okay no problem

2600.76 --> 2606.099
now if I'm talking about somebody you're

2604.0 --> 2608.64
I'm gonna be very clear about who I'm

2606.099 --> 2608.6400000000003
talking about

2612.96 --> 2616.839
celebrate any Spring Festival I don't

2615.28 --> 2620.52
know if they do that in Amsterdam

2616.839 --> 2620.52
because I don't live in Amsterdam

2629.859 --> 2635.2599999999998
but I think that in this province there

2632.2 --> 2637.96
are some spring celebrations

2635.26 --> 2640.3590000000004
I mean even when it was at the Waldorf

2637.96 --> 2642.579
School those people and that's like not

2640.359 --> 2645.42
too far away from here it's just a

2642.579 --> 2645.42
little South like

2645.46 --> 2651.2400000000002
20 or 10 miles south from here or

2649.119 --> 2651.2400000000002
something

2652.78 --> 2657.3390000000004
and that entire place is like they're

2655.0 --> 2658.78
all very well dwarf oriented a lot of

2657.339 --> 2660.96
them

2658.78 --> 2664.6800000000003
it's like a waldorf Village type

2660.96 --> 2664.68
situation in many ways

2665.56 --> 2669.52
or at least it used to be I don't know

2667.48 --> 2672.2400000000002
what it's like now I still think it

2669.52 --> 2672.24
still is better

2676.54 --> 2683.619
but they celebrate spring

2679.72 --> 2685.79
through Saint Martin I think

2683.619 --> 2689.78
when is that

2685.79 --> 2689.7799999999997
[Music]

2690.64 --> 2693.5989999999997
that's not

2696.47 --> 2701.93
[Music]

2701.079 --> 2703.8390000000004
wait what

2701.93 --> 2707.6189999999997
[Music]

2703.839 --> 2710.2
no okay I got it all wrong

2707.619 --> 2711.7000000000003
but it is a celebration that they do

2710.2 --> 2714.96
have

2711.7 --> 2714.96
but that's in November

2715.119 --> 2721.1800000000003
so I'm not sure

2717.599 --> 2723.1600000000003
I mean there is Easter we do in the

2721.18 --> 2725.7599999999998
Netherlands Easter is very typically

2723.16 --> 2725.7599999999998
celebrated

2726.64 --> 2730.2
there is in May isn't it

2735.64 --> 2741.5989999999997
that was April

2737.44 --> 2741.599
right so yeah we celebrate Easter

2741.94 --> 2745.26
April 9th

2745.3 --> 2748.26
a little over a month

2761.079 --> 2764.04
hey Adam again

2770.04 --> 2775.5
is tiger bear clutchy I don't know is he

2781.74 --> 2786.4799999999996
do I celebrate Easter if my dad no

2789.79 --> 2794.8
[Music]

2792.46 --> 2797.98
I mean celebrating Easter is typically

2794.8 --> 2800.1600000000003
for families with little children

2797.98 --> 2800.16
foreign

2801.16 --> 2804.5989999999997
because of the eggs

2805.839 --> 2811.98
chocolate eggs

2808.0 --> 2811.98
Etc and like Easter breakfast

2814.42 --> 2819.579
used to do that with my family too

2817.42 --> 2821.7400000000002
but I mean if you don't really have a

2819.579 --> 2824.44
family with little children then there's

2821.74 --> 2826.839
unless everybody just loves in their

2824.44 --> 2831.0
older children I mean as we still did

2826.839 --> 2831.0
that even when I was like in my teens

2834.579 --> 2841.1800000000003
and we typically even did like big

2837.0 --> 2844.119
bigger family meetups so we would get

2841.18 --> 2847.18
my mother and her sister

2844.119 --> 2850.54
her family and we all got together then

2847.18 --> 2855.7799999999997
with my grandma there too

2850.54 --> 2855.7799999999997
in the old farmhouse in freezeland

2856.48 --> 2862.68
and then celebrate Easter there and like

2858.819 --> 2862.68
also do garden work and all that

2864.06 --> 2869.46
those yeah in retrospect those were

2866.74 --> 2869.4599999999996
really good times

2871.48 --> 2874.14
foreign

2874.18 --> 2880.66
but I mean I don't celebrate Easter

2877.359 --> 2883.74
like on my own and I don't eat like

2880.66 --> 2883.74
chocolate eggs either

2888.22 --> 2892.66
I mean I might

2890.2 --> 2894.0989999999997
maybe like one time

2892.66 --> 2898.0
we'll see

2894.099 --> 2899.92
usually I just find them too expensive

2898.0 --> 2901.96
the organic variety that is I'm

2899.92 --> 2905.04
definitely not eating non-organic

2901.96 --> 2905.04
chocolate eggs thanks

2907.599 --> 2910.44
obviously

2924.76 --> 2928.98
the rose unadopted huh

2935.2 --> 2938.46
that's weird though

2941.079 --> 2945.6400000000003
gig

2943.24 --> 2948.54
about yeah about the uh the greenhouse

2945.64 --> 2948.54
thing but I mean

2950.44 --> 2953.88
it doesn't make any sense

2956.079 --> 2963.3590000000004
I mean it's just a little road like what

2959.079 --> 2963.3590000000004
I I don't get it how does that even work

2966.3 --> 2971.099
nieces I I just have nephews

2973.9 --> 2978.579
I don't have any nieces

2976.839 --> 2981.4
but uh

2978.579 --> 2986.2200000000003
like my nephew

2981.4 --> 2986.2200000000003
from my aunt is I think like

2986.5 --> 2991.079
what is it three years younger than me

2988.66 --> 2991.0789999999997
or something

2995.38 --> 2998.52
maybe a bit more

3013.26 --> 3017.8390000000004
right but yeah Cheech McDuck I mean

3018.119 --> 3022.339
are they getting like a lawyer or

3020.16 --> 3022.339
anything

3022.5 --> 3028.28
are they just letting it all happen

3024.619 --> 3028.28
because yeah

3030.66 --> 3035.96
should be something that you can do to

3032.819 --> 3035.96
at least obstruct it

3044.16 --> 3049.94
haven't seen collect dude I've been

3045.96 --> 3049.94
disconnected from clutch for a long time

3049.98 --> 3055.7
you started to like really get super

3052.8 --> 3055.7000000000003
savanye

3060.54 --> 3064.5
I don't think he'd be back because I

3063.059 --> 3068.42
don't think he likes me anymore he's

3064.5 --> 3068.42
like he's resentful towards me

3072.839 --> 3075.5589999999997
oh

3094.92 --> 3097.46
foreign

3102.92 --> 3106.46
Queen yeah

3112.98 --> 3118.76
any used to do streams I think with a

3115.619 --> 3118.76
good servant as well

3120.42 --> 3125.42
they just I think it just got like in

3122.64 --> 3125.42
fights with everybody

3127.68 --> 3130.7
and it got worse

3135.559 --> 3139.4
hello Earth is live

3146.359 --> 3151.22
yeah rest in peace good servant indeed

3165.839 --> 3169.5589999999997
right but it shouldn't slow down as much

3168.059 --> 3172.26
and yeah

3169.559 --> 3175.2000000000003
but the chat is kind of flowing

3172.26 --> 3177.7200000000003
again that's pretty cool

3175.2 --> 3181.0989999999997
but now I completely lost my train of

3177.72 --> 3181.0989999999997
thinking from earlier

3181.2 --> 3184.339
but I guess that's okay

3205.74 --> 3210.66
what happened to Tony it's time to wake

3207.54 --> 3212.579
up I don't know

3210.66 --> 3215.5989999999997
who are you talking to who are you

3212.579 --> 3215.599
talking about I mean

3233.339 --> 3239.24
I had derpillar indeed

3235.98 --> 3239.2400000000002
I guess it's time

3241.5 --> 3247.52
so you got any point Glover

3244.619 --> 3247.52
got a point

3249.78 --> 3253.92
let me guess you're gonna roll out

3251.52 --> 3256.579
regurgitated nonsense arguments that

3253.92 --> 3259.319
have been refuted yet keep getting

3256.579 --> 3262.579
represented over and over again for like

3259.319 --> 3262.579
the last eight years

3264.66 --> 3269.18
is that what you're gonna do here Earth

3266.7 --> 3269.18
is life

3270.44 --> 3274.76
super globe regurgitator

3287.76 --> 3294.0
you nope you have nothing it's okay

3291.3 --> 3296.88
laughs

3294.0 --> 3299.16
so you're just a globe believer for no

3296.88 --> 3301.6800000000003
damn reason you just leave it to Glow

3299.16 --> 3304.22
but you have nothing

3301.68 --> 3304.22
all right

3309.96 --> 3314.579
although if you have nothing then why

3312.359 --> 3318.319
would you hold on though you know

3314.579 --> 3318.319
why are you a glober then

3330.54 --> 3336.0
Bill Gates in India Something's Cooking

3332.819 --> 3339.48
yeah no doubt I mean turret

3336.0 --> 3342.5
I mean the globalists didn't like how

3339.48 --> 3345.3
India is basically rejecting the whole

3342.5 --> 3347.819
medical situation

3345.3 --> 3351.42
so as Bill Gates like uh no we need to

3347.819 --> 3352.5589999999997
oh we need more vaccines of course for

3351.42 --> 3354.96
India

3352.559 --> 3357.1800000000003
yeah the something is brewing yeah

3354.96 --> 3359.339
there's gonna be a new rollout something

3357.18 --> 3361.5
new there's always something new right

3359.339 --> 3363.92
that's what these guys like Bill Gates

3361.5 --> 3363.92
do

3367.74 --> 3370.74
foreign

3372.059 --> 3377.8190000000004
except for pictures you took in Hawaii

3376.079 --> 3380.7200000000003
what

3377.819 --> 3380.72
what do you mean

3381.599 --> 3387.0
pictures you took in a why proof the

3384.3 --> 3389.54
Earth is a globe do they really how did

3387.0 --> 3389.54
they do that

3391.64 --> 3394.64
thank you

3409.16 --> 3416.2999999999997
uh okay tiger bear what 24 hours on in

3414.059 --> 3416.3
the south

3420.78 --> 3425.4
there's no evidence for that there was

3423.24 --> 3429.5989999999997
like one single video

3425.4 --> 3432.44
of an obviously edited

3429.599 --> 3432.44
spin around

3436.38 --> 3443.96
it was edited

3438.24 --> 3443.9599999999996
there's no 24 7. our sun in the south

3445.98 --> 3449.72
or at least there's no proof of it

3468.96 --> 3473.48
okay

3471.24 --> 3473.4799999999996
foreign

3518.42 --> 3524.7200000000003
footage oh really

3522.059 --> 3524.7200000000003
where

3528.96 --> 3532.7400000000002
why isn't it being shoved in our faces

3531.599 --> 3537.54
then

3532.74 --> 3542.299
really oh that that's just happened okay

3537.54 --> 3542.299
yeah I think that's like called a bluff

3543.54 --> 3548.819
okay

3545.4 --> 3552.42
because I knew a person

3548.819 --> 3555.839
back in the early Flat Earth talks days

3552.42 --> 3558.119
that actually went there I had him on my

3555.839 --> 3561.119
show it was called Robert shortman he

3558.119 --> 3563.1600000000003
was a engineer mechanic

3561.119 --> 3565.799
in Antarctica

3563.16 --> 3568.6189999999997
he was there for a very long time

3565.799 --> 3570.42
and testified there is no 24-hour Sun

3568.619 --> 3574.339
there

3570.42 --> 3574.339
that's a myth it's a lie

3584.76 --> 3591.2990000000004
right and he it's not that difficult to

3588.119 --> 3593.7000000000003
tell either you know why because

3591.299 --> 3595.799
well when you're going to Antarctica

3593.7 --> 3596.819
there yeah you're gonna do it during the

3595.799 --> 3598.859
summer

3596.819 --> 3601.14
huh because otherwise you're gonna

3598.859 --> 3603.839
freaking freeze to death very quickly

3601.14 --> 3606.74
every time you set foot outside of the

3603.839 --> 3606.74
compounds

3607.2 --> 3612.48
so

3609.0 --> 3614.579
if there would be a 24-hour Sun it would

3612.48 --> 3616.26
be during the summer so anybody that

3614.579 --> 3617.819
goes there to work

3616.26 --> 3619.8590000000004
gonna go there during the summer they're

3617.819 --> 3624.299
gonna see it yeah guess what he went

3619.859 --> 3627.319
there during the summer no 24-hour Sun

3624.299 --> 3627.319
it's a myth

3628.38 --> 3632.0
time I just told you

3632.339 --> 3637.5789999999997
anybody that's gonna go there is gonna

3634.5 --> 3637.579
go during the summer

3643.859 --> 3646.92
otherwise you're going to freeze to

3645.54 --> 3648.9
death

3646.92 --> 3651.299
gonna be very freaking miserable when

3648.9 --> 3653.599
it's dark all the time and extremely

3651.299 --> 3653.599
cold

3662.359 --> 3668.46
no no no cheese McDuck he's talking

3665.46 --> 3670.7400000000002
about the 24-hour Sun

3668.46 --> 3673.2
on camera

3670.74 --> 3675.359
in Antarctica

3673.2 --> 3679.5
that's what he's talking he says oh

3675.359 --> 3682.04
there's an uncut version oh yeah

3679.5 --> 3682.04
sure

3684.54 --> 3693.2599999999998
the 24-hour sun is in the winter time

3688.68 --> 3693.2599999999998
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

3693.9 --> 3697.88
that makes no damn sense

3697.98 --> 3704.72
what the hell are you blabbering about

3700.98 --> 3704.72
you [ __ ] weirdo

3708.78 --> 3713.52
do you even know what what summer and

3711.18 --> 3714.4199999999996
winter are

3713.52 --> 3717.9
yeah

3714.42 --> 3720.119
when is the 24-hour Sun happen in say

3717.9 --> 3723.48
the tippy tip or Norway or one of those

3720.119 --> 3727.28
islands up when when does it happen

3723.48 --> 3727.28
it happens during the summer

3728.28 --> 3731.46
yeah it's there all the time during the

3730.44 --> 3733.619
summer

3731.46 --> 3738.42
yeah

3733.619 --> 3741.92
not the winter you dummy

3738.42 --> 3741.92
that makes no sense

3742.5 --> 3747.26
you don't seem to be understanding what

3744.299 --> 3747.2599999999998
the hell you're talking about

3754.2 --> 3759.18
yeah I know

3756.42 --> 3761.94
I know steamy Traveler

3759.18 --> 3763.98
so when I'm talking about the summer in

3761.94 --> 3765.96
Antarctica

3763.98 --> 3768.48
it's going to be the summer in

3765.96 --> 3770.04
Antarctica yeah when that is the summer

3768.48 --> 3773.22
in Antarctica it's going to be winter

3770.04 --> 3776.64
here in the North

3773.22 --> 3779.52
in Europe and North America and Asia

3776.64 --> 3783.6189999999997
yeah I know that yeah

3779.52 --> 3783.619
maybe this guy doesn't seem to know that

3786.54 --> 3790.099
like what the hell are you talking about

3792.42 --> 3796.98
sometimes it's been like a [ __ ]

3793.98 --> 3796.98
perhaps

3797.4 --> 3802.859
but it's all [ __ ]

3799.859 --> 3805.68
it's nonsense there is no 24 hour song

3802.859 --> 3807.0
in Antarctica and it's definitely not

3805.68 --> 3809.5789999999997
during the winter that it makes

3807.0 --> 3811.74
absolutely no sense

3809.579 --> 3814.2200000000003
sound very stupid when you say something

3811.74 --> 3814.22
like that

3819.78 --> 3824.88
yeah so there's no 24-hour sun in

3822.78 --> 3828.3590000000004
Antarctica there's no footage evidence

3824.88 --> 3833.0
for this this supposed uncut video

3828.359 --> 3833.0
that's really cute email it to me

3834.059 --> 3839.76
because there's no way

3836.819 --> 3841.799
it isn't there that doesn't exist

3839.76 --> 3843.7200000000003
can't exist

3841.799 --> 3846.319
especially during winter it makes even

3843.72 --> 3846.319
less sense

3846.359 --> 3850.799
so either you're just talking complete

3849.24 --> 3855.02
[ __ ]

3850.799 --> 3855.02
or somebody's playing a trick on you

3869.28 --> 3874.88
what month did my I don't [ __ ] know

3875.52 --> 3881.64
dude that's like eight years ago I

3878.819 --> 3883.079
haven't seen him around in ages

3881.64 --> 3885.359
stream

3883.079 --> 3889.099
I have a stream there are streams with

3885.359 --> 3889.0989999999997
him he has streams on his channel

3891.54 --> 3894.859
I think his Channel's still there

3896.76 --> 3901.3390000000004
do you want to yeah I want the video

3911.0 --> 3920.22
how would you email it to me

3915.24 --> 3922.64
through email you email it to me through

3920.22 --> 3922.64
email

3931.799 --> 3937.819
post a link

3933.599 --> 3937.819
no not giving him a wrench

4009.52 --> 4015.339
what are you talking about a man like me

4019.339 --> 4024.38
what the [ __ ] do you mean it would be

4021.619 --> 4027.819
winter for twin what the hell are you

4024.38 --> 4027.819
talking about a man like me

4030.2 --> 4037.0989999999997
it makes no sense it makes no sense to

4033.14 --> 4040.8799999999997
even say that like what is a summer a

4037.099 --> 4042.2200000000003
summer is when the sun has the most air

4040.88 --> 4045.92
time

4042.22 --> 4050.359
yeah when it's gonna be either the

4045.92 --> 4054.14
closest on a disk or at its highest

4050.359 --> 4057.799
biggest Arc yeah

4054.14 --> 4060.799
and guess what 24 hours is a very big

4057.799 --> 4062.359
Arc that means it's a complete circle

4060.799 --> 4064.339
yeah

4062.359 --> 4067.52
how the hell is that supposed to happen

4064.339 --> 4069.74
in the winter

4067.52 --> 4072.5
makes absolutely no sense well it's

4069.74 --> 4076.52
gonna make this little circle just like

4072.5 --> 4078.079
what the [ __ ] are you talking about man

4076.52 --> 4080.24
it's winter

4078.079 --> 4083.0
How can there be

4080.24 --> 4085.819
a 24-hour Sun during the winter it makes

4083.0 --> 4088.24
no damn sense to even say that a man

4085.819 --> 4088.24
like me

4109.52 --> 4112.0
okay

4117.68 --> 4120.919
[Music]

4122.02 --> 4128.359
it's a sensor non-local hologram it can

4125.359 --> 4132.279
do whatever it wants yeah

4128.359 --> 4132.279
but it'll still have to make sense

4136.88 --> 4141.62
and if it doesn't make sense

4139.1 --> 4144.58
well then you better damn well catch it

4141.62 --> 4144.58
on video

4176.779 --> 4182.080000000001
what

4179.179 --> 4182.08
no way

4182.66 --> 4187.239
that makes no freaking sense so I don't

4184.759 --> 4187.239
see in here

4207.26 --> 4213.46
this is edited the pathway makes no

4210.32 --> 4213.46
freaking sense dude

4214.16 --> 4220.699
didn't you see that

4217.4 --> 4226.5199999999995
steamy traveler like look at like the 50

4220.699 --> 4229.0599999999995
to 55 in that video link you posted sun

4226.52 --> 4229.06
goes like

4229.58 --> 4234.5599999999995
slowly then there's a mountain and it's

4232.1 --> 4237.9800000000005
certainly behind about the pork

4234.56 --> 4238.8
right yeah that's how the Sun goes It

4237.98 --> 4241.909
goes

4238.8 --> 4241.909000000001
[Music]

4242.199 --> 4250.78
no no it freaking doesn't that's not the

4246.32 --> 4250.78
same Sun pathway that's a complete edit

4250.84 --> 4255.82
Godzilla that's a completely edited

4253.52 --> 4255.820000000001
video

4259.34 --> 4265.0
yeah sorry Steven traveled it wasn't you

4261.44 --> 4265.0
it was Godzilla yeah

4267.62 --> 4272.3
our summer is there winter yeah but I'm

4269.659 --> 4276.5
not talking about our summer I'm talking

4272.3 --> 4278.2390000000005
about winter or summer talking about the

4276.5 --> 4281.14
location

4278.239 --> 4281.139999999999
[ __ ] sake

4283.46 --> 4286.96
hey let's G good to see you

4288.26 --> 4293.8
are you buried in with the snow yet

4305.26 --> 4311.42
you just posted his video oh you did how

4309.98 --> 4314.139999999999
did you how the hell did you know there

4311.42 --> 4314.14
was his video

4316.159 --> 4321.62
okay

4318.08 --> 4324.98
ah you seem to be correct

4321.62 --> 4327.32
it does look like that video

4324.98 --> 4329.599999999999
okay so I just reviewed that video Yeah

4327.32 --> 4331.46
well again

4329.6 --> 4334.6990000000005
I'll show it to you I'll actually just

4331.46 --> 4338.26
show it I mean you gotta see that

4334.699 --> 4338.259999999999
this is so bizarre

4338.42 --> 4344.4400000000005
I'll start here

4340.76 --> 4344.4400000000005
okay I'm gonna do this

4362.9 --> 4367.78
okay all right so take a look at this

4368.84 --> 4375.62
now look as the sun

4373.04 --> 4377.42
is basically at this height can you see

4375.62 --> 4380.42
my mice Point yeah you can see my mouse

4377.42 --> 4382.34
pointer right yeah

4380.42 --> 4385.76
so it's at this height roughly somewhere

4382.34 --> 4389.5
over here no now look

4385.76 --> 4389.5
it's over here see

4391.699 --> 4395.54
look what's gonna happen now see it's

4393.92 --> 4397.46
still over here

4395.54 --> 4400.3
oh

4397.46 --> 4400.3
and suddenly

4400.36 --> 4406.12
all the way up there it's suddenly just

4403.52 --> 4406.120000000001
going up

4406.88 --> 4410.86
and then it kind of stays there up

4411.62 --> 4414.099999999999
like

4415.76 --> 4418.719
it doesn't look right

4428.659 --> 4431.259999999999
foreign

4432.58 --> 4437.679
made with the mountain that's just

4435.08 --> 4437.679
ridiculous

4439.219 --> 4443.4800000000005
I guess it kind of like goes in an

4441.44 --> 4445.78
oscillating pattern too that's really

4443.48 --> 4445.78
weird

4462.679 --> 4467.3
right but yeah there's no clouds in here

4465.26 --> 4470.6
so there's no

4467.3 --> 4472.159000000001
obviously inconsistent Cloud patterns oh

4470.6 --> 4475.659000000001
except for here

4472.159 --> 4475.659
but that's just a brief moment

4482.48 --> 4487.0
what the hell no the clothes are going

4484.159 --> 4487.0
in a different direction

4487.159 --> 4491.299999999999
what the hell did you guys see that I

4489.739 --> 4494.659
didn't even pick up on that like look

4491.3 --> 4497.360000000001
here clouds are going towards the sun

4494.659 --> 4499.879999999999
you see that

4497.36 --> 4501.62
like very pronouncedly it's going that

4499.88 --> 4504.5
direction

4501.62 --> 4509.199
and then what happens

4504.5 --> 4509.199
now the clouds are coming from there

4510.38 --> 4513.04
what

4527.36 --> 4532.219
whatever anyway

4529.58 --> 4533.78
yeah thanks for sharing the video at

4532.219 --> 4536.0
least

4533.78 --> 4538.94
but

4536.0 --> 4542.02
it doesn't look like uh

4538.94 --> 4542.0199999999995
genuine to me

4575.5 --> 4583.28
all right so look it's just nonsense

4579.5 --> 4586.1
is no 24-hour sun in Antarctica and dude

4583.28 --> 4588.739
even if there was I personally wouldn't

4586.1 --> 4591.38
give a [ __ ] it doesn't matter to me it

4588.739 --> 4595.04
doesn't prove a glow

4591.38 --> 4597.8
I mean the sun is a non-local hologram

4595.04 --> 4600.739
it isn't in any location

4597.8 --> 4603.46
the angles don't line up

4600.739 --> 4603.459999999999
properly

4604.12 --> 4610.04
and the Moon I mean where's the moon

4607.699 --> 4612.44
approach footage so it's all just

4610.04 --> 4615.199
Holograms like it wouldn't matter I've

4612.44 --> 4617.78
speculated even that like what if you go

4615.199 --> 4621.46
further south or further north then like

4617.78 --> 4621.46
really weird things could happen

4621.92 --> 4625.88
there's already sightings of pretty damn

4624.44 --> 4628.46
weird things

4625.88 --> 4630.88
like in an airplane did you guys ever

4628.46 --> 4635.14
see that that's like a while ago now

4630.88 --> 4635.14
that like airline pilots

4635.48 --> 4640.699
would go like somewhere in the North

4638.3 --> 4642.92
from one region to another and then they

4640.699 --> 4646.099999999999
would see the sun like speed by

4642.92 --> 4647.6
basically as their like the Horizon in

4646.1 --> 4651.820000000001
the distance and they see the sun just

4647.6 --> 4651.820000000001
speed by and then it goes under

4652.04 --> 4656.9
and wait a little and then poof there it

4655.34 --> 4658.76
is again

4656.9 --> 4662.239
like what

4658.76 --> 4665.3
like that's definitely not a complete

4662.239 --> 4667.16
Arc where it went all the way over there

4665.3 --> 4671.0
and no it's just like

4667.16 --> 4674.0199999999995

4671.0 --> 4674.02
what the hell

4674.96 --> 4680.5
try and make sense of that

4677.3 --> 4680.5
it's holographic

4685.52 --> 4692.179
fake sudden Gates has put no no Gates is

4689.78 --> 4694.639999999999
not putting up fake Suns anywhere that's

4692.179 --> 4698.4400000000005
nonsense

4694.64 --> 4698.4400000000005
just absolute horseshit

4726.64 --> 4729.64
foreign

4729.88 --> 4736.400000000001
oh really where is it

4733.64 --> 4739.820000000001
I know that they said it and it's been

4736.4 --> 4741.08
over the news it's all more heliocentric

4739.82 --> 4743.92
nonsense and science fiction

4741.08 --> 4743.92
reinforcement

4749.36 --> 4754.46
like where is it then where's this

4752.48 --> 4757.218999999999
Chinese Sun

4754.46 --> 4759.92
a man like me where show it to me show

4757.219 --> 4760.699
the live footage of the Sun that fake

4759.92 --> 4763.54
Sun

4760.699 --> 4763.54
where is it

4769.28 --> 4774.62
there was a video of it a year ago well

4772.219 --> 4777.08
I know that apparently

4774.62 --> 4779.54
they did like create some kind of a

4777.08 --> 4781.88
weird plasma reaction or something like

4779.54 --> 4783.56
what what they would say like if a

4781.88 --> 4785.78
reaction of some kind that did like

4783.56 --> 4789.02
create a giant Fireball that was

4785.78 --> 4792.34
extremely bright then went up

4789.02 --> 4792.34
and then it dissipated

4792.86 --> 4800.42
that's not a sun that's a giant ball of

4796.82 --> 4804.5599999999995
light emitting fire or something yeah

4800.42 --> 4807.6990000000005
that's not a sun yeah a Sun stays

4804.56 --> 4807.6990000000005
hangs around

4807.739 --> 4811.0599999999995
that's not what that was

4815.9 --> 4821.0599999999995
to call that a sun is based off the

4819.44 --> 4825.139999999999
science fiction heliocentric

4821.06 --> 4828.400000000001
interpretation of what the sun should be

4825.14 --> 4828.400000000001
it's not what a sun is

4831.4 --> 4837.32
I'll just

4833.44 --> 4838.879999999999
mashing it up in your head so that if

4837.32 --> 4840.98
you believe there are horseshit

4838.88 --> 4843.4400000000005
eventually you will not be able to know

4840.98 --> 4846.459999999999
the difference between science fiction

4843.44 --> 4846.46
and reality

4847.28 --> 4851.62
sent a playlist in my ear okay

4852.199 --> 4854.739
sure

4855.739 --> 4860.379999999999
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

4857.42 --> 4860.38
break I'll be right back

4882.4 --> 4885.4
thank you

4958.699 --> 4961.48
foreign

5017.92 --> 5020.34
thank you

5023.08 --> 5029.5
it's all the same location dude it's all

5026.62 --> 5031.92
just one location

5029.5 --> 5031.92
and

5033.699 --> 5035.699
then

5041.04 --> 5045.48
most of it is like the same video

5047.02 --> 5052.5
so your playlist is kind of useless

5049.3 --> 5052.5
there Earth's life

5060.46 --> 5065.44
but by all means check it out for

5063.159 --> 5069.48
yourself guys

5065.44 --> 5069.48
here's his playlist link

5082.5 --> 5085.859
[Music]

5091.54 --> 5095.04
right so yeah

5095.56 --> 5099.659000000001
it's all very nice that you think that

5101.56 --> 5105.4800000000005
video reversed what

5106.659 --> 5109.92
what are you talking about

5126.52 --> 5129.52
anyway

5131.92 --> 5135.12
spring cleaning

5135.4 --> 5141.58
this is a good time for it I think

5138.4 --> 5143.259999999999
cleaning up also in preparation for the

5141.58 --> 5145.54
spring

5143.26 --> 5149.02
because spring is also the time that a

5145.54 --> 5153.28
lot of Life basically reawakens so

5149.02 --> 5153.280000000001
like bugs fungi

5154.9 --> 5161.5
and

5157.5 --> 5164.34
in bacteria too so it's it's good to

5161.5 --> 5167.94
clean up in anticipation of that stuff

5164.34 --> 5167.9400000000005
making its move

5196.3 --> 5200.9800000000005
there are dates well super cute like

5199.3 --> 5203.62
Earth is life

5200.98 --> 5205.48
let's just say you're right

5203.62 --> 5207.28
okay

5205.48 --> 5211.419999999999
now what

5207.28 --> 5213.94
there's a 24-hour sun over at Antarctica

5211.42 --> 5215.8
apparently

5213.94 --> 5218.138999999999
so what

5215.8 --> 5220.719
now what

5218.139 --> 5223.139
oh you've proven the Earth is not a disc

5220.719 --> 5226.12
with a sun and a very specifically

5223.139 --> 5228.159000000001
presumed to be location hovering over

5226.12 --> 5231.219
that disc

5228.159 --> 5232.179
because then there wouldn't be a 24-hour

5231.219 --> 5236.199
Sun

5232.179 --> 5237.639
like that is that your argument Earth is

5236.199 --> 5239.62
life

5237.639 --> 5242.62
because hey yeah

5239.62 --> 5246.34
I mean the Earth isn't a disc with a

5242.62 --> 5248.08
ball of a light hanging over it in a

5246.34 --> 5250.900000000001
euclidean position

5248.08 --> 5254.82
so

5250.9 --> 5254.82
in that sense I'm all with you

5258.52 --> 5263.26
what was that it

5260.56 --> 5265.7390000000005
was that the the whole point of it Earth

5263.26 --> 5265.7390000000005
is life

5275.08 --> 5279.12
were you fighting the disc Earth

5302.88 --> 5306.659000000001
why so silent

5309.159 --> 5312.159
sure

5326.86 --> 5331.199
might have never seen before okay fine

5344.44 --> 5351.099999999999
but why why would you want me to see

5347.44 --> 5355.5599999999995
that what's the point of seeing that

5351.1 --> 5355.56
Earth is life what what is your point

5390.28 --> 5396.099999999999
are you talking about Earth is life I

5393.159 --> 5399.759999999999
know who a man like me is and like me

5396.1 --> 5401.7390000000005
has been following for years so

5399.76 --> 5404.4400000000005
you don't have to tell me how to deal

5401.739 --> 5406.799999999999
with the people that visit my chat that

5404.44 --> 5406.799999999999
I know

5407.8 --> 5413.58
but I'm asking you like why why bring it

5411.46 --> 5413.58
up

5413.98 --> 5418.0
I remember if I remember correctly you

5416.139 --> 5419.62
said earlier that you're a big ball

5418.0 --> 5421.719
believer

5419.62 --> 5423.599999999999
but you didn't have any arguments except

5421.719 --> 5427.12
for this

5423.6 --> 5429.820000000001
so how is this an argument

5427.12 --> 5432.58
for the ball Earth

5429.82 --> 5435.36
your 24-hour sun in the Antarctica

5432.58 --> 5435.36
allegedly

5442.719 --> 5445.719
okay

5447.0 --> 5452.1
like that what are you talking about

5449.38 --> 5452.1
tiger bear

5453.45 --> 5462.4
[Music]

5459.58 --> 5465.76
oh because I said there's no 24 hour

5462.4 --> 5467.62
video okay cool yeah I'll just not bring

5465.76 --> 5469.6
that up then again

5467.62 --> 5471.4
because that's the only thing right I

5469.6 --> 5473.139
mean you bring it up just because I say

5471.4 --> 5475.78
that you don't actually have an argument

5473.139 --> 5478.78
or a point with it or anything just like

5475.78 --> 5484.139
oh no I said something you think it's

5478.78 --> 5484.139
wrong so you speak up oh great

5484.56 --> 5490.84
[ __ ] great instead of all you guys do

5487.6 --> 5493.900000000001
is just stand around do nothing and wait

5490.84 --> 5495.9400000000005
for Arwin to contradict himself or say

5493.9 --> 5498.219
something wrong

5495.94 --> 5500.98
that you think is incorrect and then you

5498.219 --> 5504.159
just correct me without having any

5500.98 --> 5507.48
[ __ ] point whatsoever

5504.159 --> 5507.48
is that you what you're doing

5511.679 --> 5519.9400000000005
much to type in your oh [ __ ] you dude

5516.94 --> 5519.94
[ __ ]

5520.78 --> 5524.58
the Earth is flat

5524.86 --> 5528.719
it's flat it's not a ball

5529.719 --> 5537.159
yeah the Horizon is not geometric

5534.4 --> 5539.679
it's not refracted either because the

5537.159 --> 5542.32
Horizon cannot be refracted you can't

5539.679 --> 5544.679
refract a horizon

5542.32 --> 5548.0199999999995
you can only refract

5544.679 --> 5552.639
objects that might be visible in

5548.02 --> 5555.76
relation to the Horizon not the Horizon

5552.639 --> 5558.42
itself because the Horizon itself is an

5555.76 --> 5558.42
optical effect

5558.639 --> 5564.400000000001
yeah

5560.92 --> 5567.1
so Black Swan Earth is not a ball

5564.4 --> 5570.099999999999
it's flat

5567.1 --> 5573.3
Celestial navigation only works because

5570.1 --> 5573.3
the Earth is flat

5574.179 --> 5580.36
surrounded by what appears to be a

5577.06 --> 5582.46
Celestial Demi sphere

5580.36 --> 5585.5199999999995
but it only appears that way because

5582.46 --> 5588.219
they are not objects anywhere they're

5585.52 --> 5590.4400000000005
not little lamps hanging somewhere or

5588.219 --> 5591.76
huge lamps hanging at a fast distance

5590.44 --> 5594.82
away

5591.76 --> 5598.179
they're just lights they don't have a

5594.82 --> 5601.239
location they're like a hologram

5598.179 --> 5603.6990000000005
and they present themselves as draped

5601.239 --> 5606.699
around your

5603.699 --> 5609.159
sphere of influence your sight

5606.699 --> 5612.759999999999
like a sphere always at that distance

5609.159 --> 5614.86
never getting closer or further away no

5612.76 --> 5617.38
Parallax it's just a hologram that

5614.86 --> 5620.219
surrounds us

5617.38 --> 5623.92
can you do Celestial navigation

5620.219 --> 5625.78
well I know roughly how it works

5623.92 --> 5629.679
now

5625.78 --> 5631.12
actually doing it like with the with the

5629.679 --> 5632.679
map and all that coordinating not

5631.12 --> 5634.78
getting flustered well I I would

5632.679 --> 5638.08
probably be more capable of doing that

5634.78 --> 5640.44
now than I would have been like 20 years

5638.08 --> 5640.44
ago

5640.9 --> 5646.599999999999
but I'm not a master of celestial

5644.199 --> 5648.96
navigation but I do know roughly how it

5646.6 --> 5648.96
works

5649.12 --> 5652.679
hey Nathan Oakley good to see you

5665.02 --> 5668.7390000000005
so

5666.4 --> 5673.199
got any more of your Globe evidences

5668.739 --> 5673.199
Earth is live got a got a point

5674.08 --> 5676.739
hmm

5682.84 --> 5687.88
that you present all your evidence

5685.78 --> 5690.34
present all that evidence for your Globe

5687.88 --> 5693.1
Earth is life

5690.34 --> 5696.52
Mr self-appointed big shot

5693.1 --> 5698.860000000001
thinks he has all the proof in the world

5696.52 --> 5702.06
went to showy

5698.86 --> 5702.0599999999995
to send it to me

5704.139 --> 5708.84
my thoughts on Southern Hemisphere

5706.239 --> 5708.839999999999
flights

5715.719 --> 5720.659
why the [ __ ] would I have to have

5717.699 --> 5720.659
thoughts about it

5787.42 --> 5791.7390000000005
with the flights from Johannesburg to

5789.52 --> 5793.4800000000005
Sydney I don't know anything about that

5791.739 --> 5796.959999999999
[ __ ]

5793.48 --> 5799.36
leave that up to disc earthers to bicker

5796.96 --> 5802.12
and argue about that forever with ball

5799.36 --> 5804.04
Tarts like you keep insisting on that

5802.12 --> 5806.32
nonsense

5804.04 --> 5808.84
yeah the Earth is flat

5806.32 --> 5811.179
it doesn't matter what the [ __ ] any

5808.84 --> 5816.219
flight pass would be

5811.179 --> 5819.1
it's flat The Horizon is not geometric

5816.219 --> 5821.8
it's flat Celestial navigation works

5819.1 --> 5824.7390000000005
because the Earth is flat the geometry

5821.8 --> 5826.06
of celestial navigation is based off a

5824.739 --> 5827.919999999999
flat plane

5826.06 --> 5830.26
okay

5827.92 --> 5832.84
there's no point in bickering about

5830.26 --> 5834.159000000001
whatever the freaking flight times might

5832.84 --> 5837.46
be

5834.159 --> 5840.46
it's flat it's not a ball there's no use

5837.46 --> 5843.82
to compare flight times in order to

5840.46 --> 5846.82
establish a ball which it isn't because

5843.82 --> 5849.42
The Horizon is not geometric there's no

5846.82 --> 5849.42
curvature

5849.46 --> 5854.8
and Celestial navigation works because

5852.4 --> 5857.679
the Earth is flat

5854.8 --> 5860.26
there's no point in arguing flight times

5857.679 --> 5864.159
at all

5860.26 --> 5865.96
just endless bickering about nonsense

5864.159 --> 5867.4
about presuppositions your

5865.96 --> 5871.0
presupposition against mind

5867.4 --> 5873.4
presupposition it's all [ __ ]

5871.0 --> 5876.76
yeah the maps are not

5873.4 --> 5879.58
really the terrain their projections and

5876.76 --> 5883.6
they're all off all of them

5879.58 --> 5885.76
we have no accurate representation in

5883.6 --> 5888.159000000001
which there is a consistent skill for

5885.76 --> 5892.0
the Earth realm that we know we do not

5888.159 --> 5895.839999999999
have a map that is of a consistent scale

5892.0 --> 5897.82
where everything is of the same scale

5895.84 --> 5901.3
that doesn't exist

5897.82 --> 5904.98
why the [ __ ] would we argue flight times

5901.3 --> 5904.9800000000005
between locations

5906.82 --> 5911.139
unless you want to find it out well yeah

5909.159 --> 5913.379999999999
then go find it out go puzzle it

5911.139 --> 5913.38
together

5914.56 --> 5920.38
then you're gonna be screwed because it

5918.28 --> 5922.12
doesn't puzzle together pretty much no

5920.38 --> 5924.76
matter what the [ __ ] you do

5922.12 --> 5928.0
doesn't puzzle together as a disc it

5924.76 --> 5930.280000000001
doesn't puzzle together as a globe

5928.0 --> 5933.52
and when you put it in a square or

5930.28 --> 5934.599999999999
rectangle then even then still scale is

5933.52 --> 5938.52
off

5934.6 --> 5938.52
it doesn't matter what the [ __ ] you do

5938.86 --> 5943.36
why would you bicker

5940.719 --> 5944.9800000000005
over flight times to prove supposedly

5943.36 --> 5948.4
the Earth is a globe

5944.98 --> 5950.199
when there's already evidence right in

5948.4 --> 5952.54
front of you

5950.199 --> 5955.78
then your own eyes

5952.54 --> 5958.54
that the Earth is not a globe

5955.78 --> 5960.04
because the Horizon is not geometric

5958.54 --> 5963.04
it's flat

5960.04 --> 5965.98
it rises to eye level

5963.04 --> 5968.679
when you go up slightly below eye level

5965.98 --> 5970.78
but never below that it doesn't continue

5968.679 --> 5973.84
to go down down which is what would

5970.78 --> 5975.699
happen if you would be leaving a ball

5973.84 --> 5979.679
below you

5975.699 --> 5979.678999999999
and that doesn't happen at all

5987.34 --> 5992.92
how would the looping round be

5989.199 --> 5995.678999999999
represented by a map that's what

5992.92 --> 5999.42
there's absolutely no no issue

5995.679 --> 5999.42
whatsoever steamy Traveler

6000.78 --> 6005.58
what is the issue it's just like yeah

6002.699 --> 6009.12
it's a map this side connects to that

6005.58 --> 6012.179
side I mean what's the problem what it's

6009.12 --> 6014.46
it would just be like a scroll

6012.179 --> 6016.9800000000005
connected that's it

6014.46 --> 6019.02
there's no problem for maps it's just a

6016.98 --> 6022.4
map

6019.02 --> 6022.400000000001
yeah it's not a model

6030.0 --> 6034.28
hey at face what are you doing here

6037.86 --> 6044.54
like a cylinder shade map yeah you could

6040.62 --> 6044.54
do that if you wanted

6052.5 --> 6058.219
yeah or [ __ ] Earth is live I don't trust

6055.26 --> 6058.219
you on this at all

6067.139 --> 6072.84
I don't think I trust you in general I

6069.3 --> 6074.76
think that you're actually a paid chill

6072.84 --> 6077.28
everything that you've done so far

6074.76 --> 6080.04
points to me that you are a paycheo

6077.28 --> 6082.139
that you are on the In Crowd

6080.04 --> 6085.0199999999995
that phrase is coming in there as well

6082.139 --> 6087.84
and I know he is

6085.02 --> 6092.06
they're all anti-flat earthers

6087.84 --> 6092.06
you get paid to do this sort of [ __ ]

6093.54 --> 6098.3
to get in our way with your nonsense

6132.86 --> 6139.679
model is

6135.78 --> 6142.5199999999995
no it's not a circle a man like me it

6139.679 --> 6142.52
isn't a circle

6143.4 --> 6150.9
yeah there's no Dome either

6147.9 --> 6155.339999999999
there's no barrier out there there's

6150.9 --> 6157.86
never been any any sign of a barrier

6155.34 --> 6161.34
do you realize that still now there has

6157.86 --> 6163.639
never been any form of sign of a barrier

6161.34 --> 6163.639
ever

6166.139 --> 6173.719
yeah if the Earth is a disc there would

6169.8 --> 6173.719
have to be a barrier

6173.88 --> 6180.08
yeah on the horizon at some point there

6177.719 --> 6180.08
isn't

6181.86 --> 6186.799999999999
are they perfect

6183.54 --> 6186.8
no it's not a circle

6221.94 --> 6227.879999999999
foreign

6223.26 --> 6231.5
man time has flown can't believe

6227.88 --> 6231.5
the show is almost over already

6254.639 --> 6259.619
what the various and what no I don't

6257.4 --> 6261.839999999999
think there is a barrier see me traveler

6259.619 --> 6266.54
I think it's looping in all their

6261.84 --> 6266.54
actions I don't think there is a barrier

6272.76 --> 6278.820000000001
right I mean seriously [ __ ] show it

6276.239 --> 6281.879999999999
already somebody in the [ __ ] world

6278.82 --> 6285.659
just [ __ ] show it however the [ __ ]

6281.88 --> 6288.36
you want I mean like throw a gigantic

6285.659 --> 6291.179
bomb against it or something or a pain

6288.36 --> 6294.5599999999995
bomb or something to just show that

6291.179 --> 6294.56
[ __ ] barrier then

6294.719 --> 6303.36
because there is no footage anything not

6300.239 --> 6304.58
nothing remote nothing nothing nothing

6303.36 --> 6308.5199999999995
nothing

6304.58 --> 6310.199
no barrier there's no barrier where is

6308.52 --> 6314.580000000001
the [ __ ] barrier there isn't any

6310.199 --> 6316.5
there's never been a barrier ever

6314.58 --> 6319.739
yeah

6316.5 --> 6322.08
at best there's a flat top because there

6319.739 --> 6323.5199999999995
has to be a limited volume to the

6322.08 --> 6328.5
container

6323.52 --> 6332.400000000001
that's it there's no proof of a barrier

6328.5 --> 6335.639
that stands vertically anywhere

6332.4 --> 6338.5599999999995
where's the barrier there isn't any

6335.639 --> 6341.46
because there isn't any barrier

6338.56 --> 6344.76
[Music]

6341.46 --> 6347.4
might be a flat top and yeah it would be

6344.76 --> 6350.159000000001
[ __ ] resting on nothing that's

6347.4 --> 6354.54
[ __ ] right a barrier

6350.159 --> 6357.379999999999
and penetrable resting on nothing

6354.54 --> 6361.26
correct

6357.38 --> 6364.1990000000005
might simply be this is the end of

6361.26 --> 6367.860000000001
available volume there is no more space

6364.199 --> 6370.138999999999
above it to move into so it would be

6367.86 --> 6372.0599999999995
just like a barrier that's sitting on

6370.139 --> 6374.34
nothing because it's not a physical

6372.06 --> 6378.06
object sitting there it's simply the end

6374.34 --> 6381.360000000001
of space for material to move into

6378.06 --> 6383.280000000001
that that could be it yeah no barrier

6381.36 --> 6387.96
there's no barrier

6383.28 --> 6391.159
just a volume and no more volume Beyond

6387.96 --> 6391.159
and loops

6391.8 --> 6397.619000000001
east to west north to south Loops

6394.94 --> 6400.159
interconnected looping piece of land no

6397.619 --> 6400.159
barriers

6401.219 --> 6407.04
because there's no proof any freaking

6403.56 --> 6410.6990000000005
barrier anywhere ever

6407.04 --> 6415.46
piles and piles of speculation inference

6410.699 --> 6418.379999999999
and fantasy and suggestions and no proof

6415.46 --> 6422.3
whatso [ __ ] ever

6418.38 --> 6422.3
lots of blabbermouthing

6424.679 --> 6429.78
you mean the universe ends yeah

6427.38 --> 6432.4800000000005
that's right no more volume available

6429.78 --> 6434.82
for matter to exist in

6432.48 --> 6439.44
there is a limited volume

6434.82 --> 6442.44
available for matter to exist in

6439.44 --> 6443.638999999999
and beyond that volume there is no more

6442.44 --> 6448.32
space

6443.639 --> 6450.36
for material to exist in to penetrate to

6448.32 --> 6452.04
do anything to it cannot go there

6450.36 --> 6456.5599999999995
nothing can

6452.04 --> 6456.56
except maybe light or maybe not

6460.08 --> 6466.04
blight might be the only thing that can

6462.48 --> 6466.04
even move outside

6467.82 --> 6471.719
into the

6469.56 --> 6475.280000000001
well would be void that would suggest

6471.719 --> 6475.28
volume it doesn't have any

6477.3 --> 6483.54
into the non-volume into the non-space I

6481.26 --> 6487.9400000000005
call it non-space

6483.54 --> 6487.94
how large is the universe not very big

6505.199 --> 6508.159
oh

6510.98 --> 6516.36
yeah hello by the way Richard trying not

6514.26 --> 6518.54
to be a dick it's you good to have you

6516.36 --> 6518.54
here

6520.44 --> 6526.379999999999
man you guys really only just come into

6524.04 --> 6528.36
spring into action once it's flat Earth

6526.38 --> 6530.719
debate time isn't it

6528.36 --> 6530.719
character

6547.139 --> 6552.900000000001
I mean at the beginning the show I

6549.3 --> 6555.6
talked to like three or four people

6552.9 --> 6558.5599999999995
for like an hour now everybody's just

6555.6 --> 6561.659000000001
here and talking only at the end again

6558.56 --> 6565.04
again at the end of the our win show

6561.659 --> 6565.04
everybody just comes in

6583.5 --> 6591.84
71 water nonsense

6587.699 --> 6594.259999999999
Earth is not 71 water that's the surface

6591.84 --> 6594.26
area

6595.98 --> 6602.0
if the Earth would literally it's like

6598.44 --> 6606.78
all the material would be 71 water

6602.0 --> 6610.82
we at best be some Peak sticking out

6606.78 --> 6610.82
of an endless depth of ocean

6616.56 --> 6623.42
no I don't need your freaking playlist

6618.6 --> 6623.42
Earth is life I'm kind of done with you

6626.82 --> 6630.299999999999
maybe people are more awake towards the

6628.739 --> 6633.739
energy yeah yeah that's what I'm

6630.3 --> 6633.7390000000005
Reckoning I'm

6645.119 --> 6649.5
I mean maybe I should just like move to

6647.58 --> 6652.199
Iceland or something

6649.5 --> 6653.34
I'm not even joking but I am kind of

6652.199 --> 6655.32
joking

6653.34 --> 6659.82
but

6655.32 --> 6662.04
so that in my peak time of the day

6659.82 --> 6666.179
when it's one or two o'clock

6662.04 --> 6670.34
people are actually [ __ ] awake to

6666.179 --> 6670.34
participate in my show for a change

6681.38 --> 6684.56
all right

6689.6 --> 6694.56
slender Newfoundland or something

6692.04 --> 6696.86
although Newfoundland is pretty freaking

6694.56 --> 6696.860000000001
cold

6701.6 --> 6704.689
[Applause]

6711.9 --> 6717.48
start your show alone later each day

6714.84 --> 6721.58
yeah but then then what

6717.48 --> 6721.58
then it's gonna overlap with fed

6721.739 --> 6728.959999999999
and besides when it's later in the day I

6724.56 --> 6728.96
don't have my energy is not as good

6730.159 --> 6735.0
I choose this time of the day because

6732.84 --> 6738.32
that's when I have the best energy

6735.0 --> 6738.32
available to me

6743.699 --> 6750.299999999999
might need to host debates yes well who

6747.3 --> 6753.78
wants to [ __ ] debate me fine you want

6750.3 --> 6756.900000000001
to get on and blabber on about the ball

6753.78 --> 6759.659
fine I'll get Ballers on and blabber

6756.9 --> 6761.4
about the [ __ ] ball again okay you

6759.659 --> 6763.138999999999

eight years

6845.82 --> 6854.599999999999
and I barely have any [ __ ] contacts

6849.119 --> 6854.599999999999
on Skype nobody ever [ __ ] contacts me

6854.699 --> 6862.619
for eight [ __ ] years

6857.94 --> 6865.0199999999995
an occasional person just says something

6862.619 --> 6868.92
and then they go away again never to be

6865.02 --> 6870.96
heard from again yeah great

6868.92 --> 6874.02
great

6870.96 --> 6875.94

that like to come on my show why don't

6880.56 --> 6887.34
you contact me yeah at least LSG

6883.5 --> 6889.8
actually contacts me

6887.34 --> 6892.619000000001

Traveler

6893.82 --> 6896.78
I know you

6900.719 --> 6906.42
excuse me it's like what the [ __ ] is

6903.36 --> 6910.679
even the point of just coming here and

6906.42 --> 6912.179
just hanging in the chat and that's it

6910.679 --> 6914.6990000000005
why

6912.179 --> 6916.56
are you here because you're so [ __ ]

6914.699 --> 6919.138999999999
bored out there

6916.56 --> 6920.639
that you just want some chat to hang

6919.139 --> 6923.219
around with and

6920.639 --> 6926.4800000000005
seems somewhat familiar with people is

6923.219 --> 6926.4800000000005
that it is that all

6928.82 --> 6934.08
is that all you do

6931.86 --> 6938.659
is that all that I am to you just some

6934.08 --> 6938.659
stupid babysitter to hang around with

6942.739 --> 6949.08
I want this show to work I want people

6946.26 --> 6952.7390000000005
to get on I've been asking yeah I want

6949.08 --> 6956.28
people on yeah you hear me I want people

6952.739 --> 6959.04
on this show besides me

6956.28 --> 6963.0
am I clear enough

6959.04 --> 6965.28
I want people on my show besides me I'm

6963.0 --> 6967.44
getting really [ __ ] sick of hearing

6965.28 --> 6969.9
myself every day

6967.44 --> 6972.08
okay

6969.9 --> 6972.08
foreign

6979.58 --> 6984.719
no I don't want some stupid Discord I

6982.8 --> 6989.820000000001
already have a Discord server I've been

6984.719 --> 6994.26
having a Discord server for [ __ ] four

6989.82 --> 6995.88
years zapdappy four years it's still out

6994.26 --> 6998.280000000001
there you know how many people hang

6995.88 --> 7001.900000000001
around there zero

6998.28 --> 7005.36
for [ __ ] four years zero people

7001.9 --> 7008.86
nobody even asks nobody even [ __ ]

7005.36 --> 7008.86
already has heard of it

7009.86 --> 7018.159
nobody ever visits it ever

7014.3 --> 7018.159000000001
it's been there for four years

7018.86 --> 7024.5
I'm like the most [ __ ] abandoned

7021.8 --> 7029.54
person on the [ __ ] internet

7024.5 --> 7031.58
like nobody ever does anything here

7029.54 --> 7034.04
no swarming

7031.58 --> 7036.619
no groups

7034.04 --> 7039.219
like even the [ __ ] Ballers don't even

7036.619 --> 7039.219
swore me

7039.56 --> 7044.780000000001
where the [ __ ] is everybody why doesn't

7042.199 --> 7047.78
anybody ever come here

7044.78 --> 7050.36
am I that horrific am I so [ __ ]

I'm talking about the previous year

7317.0 --> 7323.38
yeah

7319.659 --> 7323.379999999999
nobody's ever here

7323.659 --> 7331.04
when I start the show I have to wait for

7328.04 --> 7333.139
somebody to [ __ ] say something you

7331.04 --> 7335.119
know that that whole routine of checking

7333.139 --> 7337.88
the weather and the temperature

7335.119 --> 7342.86
you know why I started doing that

7337.88 --> 7344.84
because nobody would show the [ __ ] up at

7342.86 --> 7349.46
the start of my show

7344.84 --> 7354.400000000001
yeah it's literally created as filler

7349.46 --> 7354.4
because nobody [ __ ] shows up here

7373.34 --> 7379.6990000000005
yeah like what septapy like [ __ ] what

7376.76 --> 7382.54

then

7407.98 --> 7411.04
thank you

7420.199 --> 7426.678999999999
really tensor that's it it's me not

7424.28 --> 7429.08
showing up in time

7426.679 --> 7431.42
because I'm a few minutes late that's

7429.08 --> 7434.659
the reason why nobody shows the [ __ ] up

7431.42 --> 7437.84
on my show really that is it dancer

7434.659 --> 7441.159
really can I get a vote on that

7437.84 --> 7441.159000000001
can I get a vote on that

7441.32 --> 7445.34
if you anybody that's now in chat

7443.599 --> 7448.639
there's a lot of people in chat I don't

7445.34 --> 7451.82
care if you're a baller or a troll

7448.639 --> 7454.52
who whatever the [ __ ] you think you are

7451.82 --> 7456.5
if you think that people

7454.52 --> 7459.139
don't show up

7456.5 --> 7462.98
like the first half of my show

7459.139 --> 7465.92
because I don't start and exactly the

7462.98 --> 7467.598999999999
the expected time like exactly one

7465.92 --> 7471.139
o'clock is there is that the reason if

7467.599 --> 7475.099
you think so type one

7471.139 --> 7477.02
if you think it's not influential

7475.099 --> 7479.179
whatsoever

7477.02 --> 7482.540000000001
type two

7479.179 --> 7486.4400000000005
if you think that

7482.54 --> 7489.34
might have a minor influence

7486.44 --> 7489.339999999999
type three

7491.239 --> 7494.239
foreign

7506.42 --> 7512.119

into our Fortress

8516.15 --> 8521.14
[Music]

8517.479 --> 8523.479
a wind-powered lava pumping waterfall

8521.14 --> 8527.26
system

8523.479 --> 8530.08
in a dining room with literal adamantine

8527.26 --> 8534.15
table set with

8530.08 --> 8537.99
like black diamonds it's crazy

8534.15 --> 8537.99
[Music]

8548.21 --> 8552.279999999999
[Music]

8549.939 --> 8553.84
maybe relax and do some game designing

8552.28 --> 8557.140000000001
today

8553.84 --> 8559.8
maybe I'm actually continuing in Reading

8557.14 --> 8559.8
save the cat

8561.34 --> 8567.7
I am just I gotta do stuff and yeah game

8565.06 --> 8569.8
designing too but I mean the game

8567.7 --> 8572.92
designing the ball is gay three idea is

8569.8 --> 8574.179999999998
kind of like I I kind of manifested the

8572.92 --> 8577.42
skeleton

8574.18 --> 8581.08
and so even if I leave it alone

8577.42 --> 8582.939
it will be very much I will be very much

8581.08 --> 8585.039999999999
capable of picking it back up and

8582.939 --> 8586.479000000001
getting right back into it

8585.04 --> 8590.580000000002
so

8586.479 --> 8593.438999999998
I do I need to just get more into it

8590.58 --> 8595.6
into doing it and so I'm continuing

8593.439 --> 8599.1
reading save the cat

8595.6 --> 8599.1
and it's just making notes

8600.399 --> 8608.26
because I I got it stop just starting

8604.18 --> 8611.62
things and then not finishing them

8608.26 --> 8614.439
that's a universal theme in my life one

8611.62 --> 8616.359
that frustrates me highly all the

8614.439 --> 8619.0
thousands of things that ever started

8616.359 --> 8622.439
I've finished very little of them and

8619.0 --> 8622.439
that's really bad

8623.859 --> 8630.42
like that's bad for my honor

8626.92 --> 8630.42
and for my cohesion

8632.979 --> 8639.779999999999
so I need to I need to [ __ ] force it

8636.399 --> 8642.16
I need to I need to stop making myself

8639.78 --> 8645.28
discontinue things it's like my ego just

8642.16 --> 8647.14
gets a grip on it it's like oh oh I

8645.28 --> 8649.359
don't really like doing this anymore but

8647.14 --> 8652.72
you really need to finish it okay well

8649.359 --> 8655.359
I'll just make you super inspired and

8652.72 --> 8658.24
mega distracted by something else to

8655.359 --> 8659.979000000001
force you to discontinue it then that

8658.24 --> 8662.979
happens to me

8659.979 --> 8665.438999999998
it's really [ __ ] annoying

8662.979 --> 8667.358999999999
because it's really pleasurable when it

8665.439 --> 8669.16
happens and it's like it it happens

8667.359 --> 8671.800000000001
unexpectedly and then I don't know what

8669.16 --> 8673.899
to do it's just like that time where I'm

8671.8 --> 8676.438999999998
like yeah I'm gonna become a taxi driver

8673.899 --> 8679.119999999999
now I'm gonna make this into a career

8676.439 --> 8681.52
and literally

8679.12 --> 8684.34
within a week time I meet my

8681.52 --> 8687.58
ex-girlfriend like [ __ ] this [ __ ] man

8684.34 --> 8689.26
[ __ ] you the [ __ ] world just wants me

8687.58 --> 8692.439
to [ __ ] fail with everything because

8689.26 --> 8694.899
every time I ever try anything

8692.439 --> 8698.64
suddenly everything becomes rearranged

8694.899 --> 8698.64
to make me discontinue doing that

8698.74 --> 8704.819
I'm like what the hell man

8701.14 --> 8704.819
what the [ __ ] hell

8704.83 --> 8707.889
[Music]

8708.88 --> 8713.619999999999

8711.16 --> 8715.96
even I need to stop focusing on that in

8713.62 --> 8718.240000000002
my mind it's like I am possessed and

8715.96 --> 8720.279999999999
possessed by this like a demon of

8718.24 --> 8722.14
failure and it just no matter what I

8720.28 --> 8724.78
[ __ ] do it just always keeps

8722.14 --> 8727.869999999999
directing me in that direction I'm so

8724.78 --> 8729.52
goddamn sick of it

8727.87 --> 8732.399000000001
[Music]

8729.52 --> 8734.380000000001

8762.1 --> 8764.800000000001
break through it

8763.47 --> 8768.039999999999
[Music]

8764.8 --> 8770.38
to break through caring like I need to

8768.04 --> 8772.300000000001
stop caring for that it happens that way

8770.38 --> 8775.0

8772.3 --> 8778.358999999999
just need to be able to carry on like

8775.0 --> 8780.66
how do I not have the entire [ __ ]

8778.359 --> 8783.52
world distract me whenever that happens

8780.66 --> 8786.7
I just don't want I just want to

8783.52 --> 8791.460000000001
manifest I just want to do these things

8786.7 --> 8791.460000000001
why does always everything stop me

8792.34 --> 8804.889000000001
like from the [ __ ] inside

8795.59 --> 8804.889000000001
