[Music]

137.85 --> 143.35999999999999
[Music]

139.76 --> 146.959
hello dutch sailor first in chat

143.36 --> 149.44000000000003
and hey good servant good to see you

146.959 --> 152.0
thank you for the the small paypal

149.44 --> 157.84
donation good servant

152.0 --> 157.84
i'm really appreciated

158.319 --> 161.44
every little bit helps and i really

160.319 --> 163.67999999999998
appreciate

161.44 --> 164.959
that you yeah you're really doing your

163.68 --> 167.92000000000002
best to help me out

164.959 --> 167.92000000000002
and i need it so

169.2 --> 172.56
right well i will mention it because i'm

171.44 --> 176.48
actually hoping that

172.56 --> 178.159
others will do it too i'm getting to the

176.48 --> 179.599
point again where i feel like i'm doing

178.159 --> 181.92
something wrong

179.599 --> 184.39999999999998
or that everybody that typically likes

181.92 --> 188.0
to support me is in some kind of a

184.4 --> 190.4
financial halt or something

188.0 --> 192.959
because yeah i'm practically out of

190.4 --> 192.959
money now

193.28 --> 196.959
so i'm gonna have to get complicated

195.84 --> 200.0
again

196.959 --> 204.959
right and this is why i keep asking

200.0 --> 204.959
ahead of time to prevent that sort of

210.84 --> 213.84
thing

214.08 --> 218.72
like the vaccine info very useful yeah

219.28 --> 224.799
well things are already so saturated out

223.84 --> 228.72
there

224.799 --> 232.15900000000002
you know and for somebody that's not

228.72 --> 235.04
actually dug meticulously in

232.159 --> 235.67999999999998
like the literal literature directly i

235.04 --> 237.519
just

235.68 --> 240.08
know to pick my sources and now to

237.519 --> 242.87900000000002
distinguish and

240.08 --> 242.87900000000002
like a theorist

243.68 --> 247.04000000000002
discussing through the internet taking

245.92 --> 248.72
in the the info

247.04 --> 252.319
and then cross referencing it with

248.72 --> 254.159
everything else figuring out patterns

252.319 --> 257.12
and that's how i've managed to get a

254.159 --> 259.84
goody pretty good grip

257.12 --> 262.72
on the whole covet and the vex

259.84 --> 265.59999999999997
vaccination issue

262.72 --> 266.56
so i'm glad i've been able to help you

265.6 --> 269.199
out with

266.56 --> 270.639
with getting that oversight and

269.199 --> 272.32
dispelling any doubts

270.639 --> 275.199
because there's a lot of gas lighting

272.32 --> 275.199
going on out there

275.919 --> 282.639
and sometimes it's really it gives

279.04 --> 282.96000000000004
even me like i can feel the gas lighting

282.639 --> 285.44
right

282.96 --> 286.96
it's so based on on just gaslighting

285.44 --> 289.44
pressure

286.96 --> 290.479
and just knowing others are getting

289.44 --> 292.32
trapped by that

290.479 --> 294.32
is already kind of demoralizing and

292.32 --> 297.36
that's how it works

294.32 --> 299.59999999999997
so yeah it's tough to keep a clear stand

297.36 --> 301.52000000000004
in a clear position and and like not go

299.6 --> 305.199
full savage at it

301.52 --> 307.12
and people are rolling into savage

305.199 --> 310.639
actions

307.12 --> 312.479
like matthias the walking witness did

310.639 --> 314.08
with the whole money thing yesterday and

312.479 --> 318.71999999999997
others

314.08 --> 318.71999999999997
like man two days ago the show was just

319.84 --> 325.84
very rowdy because of it

330.72 --> 336.16
what you're going to sell your e-bike

332.56 --> 336.16
why would you do that dutch sailor

337.12 --> 343.36
that i appreciate it but

341.44 --> 344.639
unless you were already planning to sell

343.36 --> 348.24
it

344.639 --> 349.84000000000003
like don't get dramatic

348.24 --> 353.84000000000003
you're probably not doing that but i

349.84 --> 353.84
appreciate it

354.56 --> 358.4
well yeah i've been getting a lot of

356.319 --> 360.08000000000004
promises though throughout the last few

358.4 --> 361.919
weeks

360.08 --> 363.44
and not a lot of people have followed

361.919 --> 367.84
through up on it

363.44 --> 367.84
right so

369.44 --> 373.52
because my e-bike breaks down so much oh

371.759 --> 378.24
okay

373.52 --> 381.84
that's weird what about it breaks down

378.24 --> 385.039
is it like a technological part issue

381.84 --> 385.039
that keeps reoccurring

386.24 --> 395.84000000000003
i'm gonna buy another one right

403.199 --> 407.12
all right anyway yeah good servant the

405.759 --> 412.639
frame breaks you know

407.12 --> 412.639
what okay that sucks

414.16 --> 417.28000000000003
that's really stupid

417.68 --> 425.12
right yeah i should definitely buy a new

420.84 --> 425.11999999999995
one that's kind of ridiculous

427.36 --> 432.47900000000004
hello nathan r made in vietnam

434.84 --> 437.84
okay

444.319 --> 450.40000000000003
so is it like a low-grade aluminium or

448.84 --> 453.84
something

450.4 --> 456.479
that would explain some things

453.84 --> 456.479
all right anyway

457.12 --> 459.44
uh

461.28 --> 465.84
won't it be unsafe for the next guy

484.639 --> 488.96000000000004
hey flat sword good to see you

490.0 --> 498.8
right yeah anyway it's saturday the 15th

495.199 --> 498.8
of may 2021

499.599 --> 507.84
just for reference

517.279 --> 523.2
right anyway yeah referring back to what

520.479 --> 527.6
you were talking about good servant

523.2 --> 531.6
you're right people

527.6 --> 532.9590000000001
get tricked into taking it as a societal

531.6 --> 535.12
thing to do

532.959 --> 536.0799999999999
when they know absolutely nothing about

535.12 --> 538.8
it

536.08 --> 539.279
and obviously don't have a realization

538.8 --> 543.12
that

539.279 --> 546.08
society as it is functioning right now

543.12 --> 547.36
is not really taking care of its

546.08 --> 550.32
citizens

547.36 --> 550.8000000000001
of the people right it's leaving that up

550.32 --> 553.9200000000001
to

550.8 --> 556.4799999999999
other people that still want to uphold

553.92 --> 560.16
taking care of other people

556.48 --> 563.519
right but the the top-down structure

560.16 --> 566.399
the media and a lot of involved

563.519 --> 569.68
governments and corporations

566.399 --> 571.839
they just they don't see it they don't

569.68 --> 571.8389999999999
see

571.92 --> 577.1999999999999
that it's literally meant to lure them

575.36 --> 579.92
into a trap

577.2 --> 581.6
and that it's getting away with it right

579.92 --> 584.7199999999999
now at least

581.6 --> 586.88
right it's managed to set up a system

584.72 --> 588.64
where it can be compartmentalized and

586.88 --> 591.4399999999999
there's still people protesting around

588.64 --> 594.48
it but it's being kept away

591.44 --> 595.519
from the original sources of output the

594.48 --> 598.48
media output

595.519 --> 599.44
there they're censoring it on their side

598.48 --> 602.839
so that people

599.44 --> 605.12
just staying there don't take notice of

602.839 --> 608.9590000000001
this

605.12 --> 610.24
keeping them spellbound to do that and

608.959 --> 613.4399999999999
to encourage it

610.24 --> 613.44
against better judgment

614.0 --> 617.36
to anybody who has been informed about

615.92 --> 620.8
it

617.36 --> 620.8000000000001
and that's what they're doing right now

622.959 --> 626.7199999999999
and yeah it really shows just how

626.079 --> 633.68
gullible

626.72 --> 636.9590000000001
people are

633.68 --> 639.76
and that's actually yeah

636.959 --> 640.56
it's not how gullible people are it's

639.76 --> 644.399
rather

640.56 --> 649.04
how gullible people are

644.399 --> 651.36
what are they like how easy

649.04 --> 652.48
they are to overlook things and engage

651.36 --> 656.16
in things they have no

652.48 --> 659.12
understanding of whatsoever how easy

656.16 --> 660.16
gullible people are to trick with this

659.12 --> 664.5600000000001
[ __ ]

660.16 --> 667.6
and how they will just intuitively

664.56 --> 670.16
defend their

667.6 --> 674.399
trust their trust in the system that

670.16 --> 676.88
shouldn't be trusted

674.399 --> 678.56
or maybe some of them will be informed

676.88 --> 680.399
and then they just don't know what to

678.56 --> 683.76
deal with it and forget about it and

680.399 --> 683.76
then act like nothing happened

686.839 --> 689.839
anyway

692.56 --> 695.68
hello clutch bear

700.32 --> 704.8000000000001
well look good servant think about it

702.72 --> 707.44
like this

704.8 --> 709.279
how many people actually do background

707.44 --> 712.0790000000001
research

709.279 --> 712.959
on their doctor on the doctor that they

712.079 --> 715.04
use

712.959 --> 718.56
how many actually know about their

715.04 --> 718.56
doctor and what they do

718.639 --> 724.88
right i think there's a lot of people

721.92 --> 725.76
just they overlook that you should do

724.88 --> 729.76
that

725.76 --> 732.3199999999999
they just trust appointed

729.76 --> 732.3199999999999
functions

736.32 --> 743.6
and they probably get it through

739.519 --> 746.0
through their parents that just try to

743.6 --> 747.44
give their children some trust towards

746.0 --> 749.519
the world so that they

747.44 --> 752.0790000000001
are not as don't feel as threatened by

749.519 --> 754.88
it but in doing that they actually set a

752.079 --> 758.959
really bad example

754.88 --> 760.959
of just go with the system

758.959 --> 762.7199999999999
which makes it even worse for the next

760.959 --> 766.0
generation

762.72 --> 769.839
because they have no example of how to

766.0 --> 773.12
logically deal with society and defend

769.839 --> 776.0790000000001
against mind control operations

773.12 --> 776.079
from society

776.639 --> 780.88
because they are just giving an example

779.36 --> 787.839
of how it is to actually

780.88 --> 787.8389999999999
roll right into it

789.12 --> 793.839
like basically against that only

791.839 --> 797.44
children that are just

793.839 --> 801.2
that have a natural rebellious spirit

797.44 --> 804.0
like even beyond like teenage rebellion

801.2 --> 804.72
only those will actually even in the

804.0 --> 807.6
face of

804.72 --> 809.36
such parenting going along with the

807.6 --> 813.2
system

809.36 --> 815.92
get a feel for that it's actually wrong

813.2 --> 816.48
because they are forcing themselves to

815.92 --> 819.5999999999999
rebel

816.48 --> 824.0790000000001
and thereby looking at it differently

819.6 --> 829.839
not from the inside view right

824.079 --> 829.8389999999999
it's weird

830.48 --> 832.88
anyway

837.839 --> 843.12
background about von braun well dutch

840.839 --> 845.6
sailor look

843.12 --> 849.44
a lot of people just don't really care

845.6 --> 849.44
too much to know all these things

850.639 --> 854.8
they think that learning about it

855.12 --> 861.92
takes away their focus on their

858.72 --> 864.1600000000001
theirs the dynamic availability

861.92 --> 865.519
of their social interactions the freedom

864.16 --> 869.04
of mind in order to

865.519 --> 871.36
play into whatever role they want for

869.04 --> 875.199
themselves when facing other people

871.36 --> 877.36
right if you're if you are engaging in

875.199 --> 879.3599999999999
thinking about a lot of big things that

877.36 --> 880.24
weighs on your shoulder and then makes

879.36 --> 881.92
communication

880.24 --> 883.839
harder i know this from personal

881.92 --> 888.8
experience because that's what i've

883.839 --> 888.8000000000001
had a lot

890.88 --> 896.0
i've been doing this for 20 years and

893.76 --> 896.72
that's always been the primary problem

896.0 --> 899.12
now with

896.72 --> 901.36
with social interaction with other

899.12 --> 904.639
people

901.36 --> 907.76
that don't do this that don't take

904.639 --> 913.839
the knowledge on their shoulders

907.76 --> 913.8389999999999
and learn to deal with it

924.839 --> 927.839
so

933.04 --> 936.639
people are conditioned not to think

935.36 --> 940.0
critically

936.639 --> 942.639
right well they're trained as a

940.0 --> 945.6
go along to get a long mechanism that

942.639 --> 948.24
yeah they are taught that

945.6 --> 948.88
and hey even back in my days they were

948.24 --> 951.759
taught that

948.88 --> 952.88
and i fell for it up to a certain degree

951.759 --> 955.36
it's just that

952.88 --> 956.16
before that engaged i already had like

955.36 --> 958.5600000000001
this strong

956.16 --> 960.48
training of trust your own spirit trust

958.56 --> 963.279
your own senses from

960.48 --> 963.839
my parents they recognized i had a lot

963.279 --> 969.36
of

963.839 --> 973.2790000000001
natural purity in my spirit and

969.36 --> 977.839
frequency sense let's just say like that

973.279 --> 979.68
so that eventually the combination of it

977.839 --> 982.32
revealed to me that go along to get

979.68 --> 984.4799999999999
along is actually really bad and once i

982.32 --> 986.72
started to truly realize that and how

984.48 --> 988.9590000000001
inside out society is that's when i

986.72 --> 992.48
basically switched inside out

988.959 --> 997.5189999999999
and retracted and scoffed at everything

992.48 --> 1000.639
that came from society everything

997.519 --> 1000.639
i really wanted out

1006.16 --> 1015.12
but yeah there's nowhere to go

1009.44 --> 1015.12
well yeah there is places to go

1016.0 --> 1025.839
but it's very different

1036.839 --> 1039.839
and

1056.06 --> 1059.1599999999999
[Music]

1064.84 --> 1067.84
hmm

1069.36 --> 1074.32
ah it's raining outside wow okay

1078.84 --> 1081.84
hmm

1082.32 --> 1088.72
so hashtag thanks beth you got a point i

1085.12 --> 1088.7199999999998
get the feeling you're a bit of a sock

1092.84 --> 1096.08
troll

1094.24 --> 1098.48
but yeah i can't be sure because you're

1096.08 --> 1108.6399999999999
not actually formulating your sentence

1098.48 --> 1111.919
in proper english

1108.64 --> 1123.8400000000001
oh that was quick good servant

1111.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
hey adam meekin good to see you

1125.52 --> 1129.2
all right there's probably not going to

1127.12 --> 1131.12
be live ball busters this evening i'm

1129.2 --> 1132.88
already saying

1131.12 --> 1134.2399999999998
because it was live yesterday or

1132.88 --> 1137.8400000000001
yesterday last

1134.24 --> 1137.84
last saturday

1143.84 --> 1147.6
you can have coffee without getting

1146.08 --> 1151.84
upset stomach

1147.6 --> 1151.84
all right well still take it easy though

1153.76 --> 1157.2
like you might wanna i don't know water

1155.6 --> 1160.559
it down

1157.2 --> 1165.1200000000001
and i hope you're not taking

1160.559 --> 1167.6
too much sugar with it or

1165.12 --> 1170.32
yeah avoid milk especially if it's

1167.6 --> 1170.32
non-organic

1177.12 --> 1181.12
because yeah i stopped using milk in my

1179.919 --> 1183.919
coffee a long time

1181.12 --> 1184.559
like two years ago three years ago long

1183.919 --> 1187.6000000000001
time ago

1184.559 --> 1189.76
man because

1187.6 --> 1191.12
i really noticed the pattern that every

1189.76 --> 1194.8799999999999
time i've drank

1191.12 --> 1198.2399999999998
my coffee it would hurt

1194.88 --> 1201.5200000000002
now in that period i was a lot bit more

1198.24 --> 1203.919
like yeah stressed out physically

1201.52 --> 1203.9189999999999
burdened

1205.2 --> 1208.48
but then when i stopped using milk and

1207.28 --> 1212.3999999999999
in general

1208.48 --> 1215.76
i stopped cheese too eventually

1212.4 --> 1217.3600000000001
because i used a lot of yeah lactose

1215.76 --> 1219.76
products

1217.36 --> 1220.799
or not a lot but i used it with that

1219.76 --> 1223.84
just in

1220.799 --> 1226.48
in various foods and drinks

1223.84 --> 1228.6399999999999
i stopped doing it and it really helped

1226.48 --> 1230.559
a lot and now i don't have any bad

1228.64 --> 1232.64
responses on the stomach from coffee

1230.559 --> 1236.1589999999999
anymore like ever

1232.64 --> 1239.8400000000001
as long as i don't drink too much

1236.159 --> 1239.8400000000001
i don't drink milk okay good

1242.4 --> 1248.64
you feel a band coming up nah

1245.6 --> 1251.9189999999999
it's just a silly sock it's just

1248.64 --> 1251.919
a sock advertisement

1255.039 --> 1262.4
like these these sock trolls they

1259.12 --> 1265.76
you could call them ranty's drones right

1262.4 --> 1265.76
it's his drone program

1270.71 --> 1279.039
[Music]

1275.28 --> 1291.84
you want to ban trolls well maybe

1279.039 --> 1291.84
maybe if it gets bad but i doubt it

1294.24 --> 1298.08
gonna watch your video this afternoon oh

1297.039 --> 1300.96
right right

1298.08 --> 1305.12
well flat side made a new video i think

1300.96 --> 1308.48
i saw that

1305.12 --> 1311.1999999999998
behind the blackpool tower right you did

1308.48 --> 1311.2
that stream

1311.679 --> 1316.48
on another channel i did see a part of

1314.96 --> 1319.76
it but

1316.48 --> 1322.799
i got kind of distracted also yeah

1319.76 --> 1325.84
look i am not really too much

1322.799 --> 1328.6399999999999
interested anymore in like the the

1325.84 --> 1333.84
observation details

1328.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
well the black pool tower in this case

1334.559 --> 1337.28
to be fair

1341.76 --> 1347.84
never been much of a calculus guy like

1344.84 --> 1347.84
that

1351.52 --> 1357.36
but from flicking through it again with

1353.679 --> 1361.8400000000001
the visuals looks kind of interesting

1357.36 --> 1361.84
it really did work it out very carefully

1372.84 --> 1375.84
hmm

1386.4 --> 1392.159
you love maths okay good servant

1400.4 --> 1405.52
dragon ball z not a what clutch bear

1411.84 --> 1417.84
hello nathan oakley good to see you

1428.84 --> 1433.6789999999999
hmm

1430.88 --> 1434.24
right oh yeah i gotta make mention that

1433.679 --> 1437.919
i thought

1434.24 --> 1440.88
i dropped it in the skype chat too

1437.919 --> 1443.2
that owen benjamin was live yesterday

1440.88 --> 1446.72
and he had a whole segment

1443.2 --> 1448.799
very detailed about flat earth and

1446.72 --> 1449.919
science and the scientific method and

1448.799 --> 1452.6399999999999
just

1449.919 --> 1453.8400000000001
basically the spirit behind it and i

1452.64 --> 1456.88
really thought he was

1453.84 --> 1456.8799999999999
totally on target

1457.52 --> 1460.1589999999999
like really

1465.12 --> 1468.4799999999998
i don't know if anybody else caught it

1466.88 --> 1471.1200000000001
he did yeah he does take

1468.48 --> 1473.6
like the streams down now after he's

1471.12 --> 1476.6399999999999
done them

1473.6 --> 1480.6399999999999
so you could probably only watch that

1476.64 --> 1486.24
on like his own website

1480.64 --> 1501.8400000000001
is it an authorized tv

1486.24 --> 1501.84
let me figure it out where is it

1502.88 --> 1509.44
going to tell on effied oh my god

1506.72 --> 1512.0
he is going to tell he's going to reveal

1509.44 --> 1516.4
the secrets

1512.0 --> 1516.4
that we don't have right

1516.72 --> 1520.24
what are your secrets ranty

1520.96 --> 1527.6000000000001
this is it's going to tell on fbd

1525.039 --> 1530.559
that's you have no idea how freaking

1527.6 --> 1530.559
funny that sounds

1532.24 --> 1543.84
this financial situation

1547.52 --> 1550.799
right clutch bear yeah glad you caught

1550.0 --> 1552.88
it too

1550.799 --> 1554.6399999999999
because it was really impressive he was

1552.88 --> 1557.919
very careful

1554.64 --> 1561.2
like i felt like almost like okay

1557.919 --> 1564.24
he has kind of watched a couple of ball

1561.2 --> 1564.24
busters or something

1564.32 --> 1568.0
because he i it's almost like i could

1566.72 --> 1570.4
feel

1568.0 --> 1572.0
that level of thinking including some of

1570.4 --> 1573.76
what i do

1572.0 --> 1575.44
the carefulness and the fractal nature

1573.76 --> 1578.8799999999999
of it i feel like he

1575.44 --> 1580.0
was in it like he caught it so sometimes

1578.88 --> 1583.5200000000002
i wonder like

1580.0 --> 1587.279
does he watch ball buster shows

1583.52 --> 1590.0
probably not flat earth debates it's too

1587.279 --> 1590.0
way out too

1591.36 --> 1597.76
too rough too too much gamma too much

1595.2 --> 1599.919
dealing with that for him probably is

1597.76 --> 1600.64
annoying but ball busters is always very

1599.919 --> 1603.3600000000001
technical

1600.64 --> 1604.88
and concise and kiwi is a very good

1603.36 --> 1608.08
hangout leader

1604.88 --> 1610.0
inspires the best in us

1608.08 --> 1612.24
so i think that he might be watching

1610.0 --> 1614.0
that sometimes

1612.24 --> 1616.08
because it felt like it in what he was

1614.0 --> 1618.559
talking about yesterday

1616.08 --> 1620.3999999999999
he wasn't just cookie cutter copy

1618.559 --> 1623.039
pasting it

1620.4 --> 1626.159
he really gave his own vision in his own

1623.039 --> 1629.84
fractal site beyond

1626.159 --> 1632.64
the solid foundation of his inside of

1629.84 --> 1635.039
basically what we agree on he gave a lot

1632.64 --> 1636.88
of detail

1635.039 --> 1639.12
so yeah just gave me the feeling like

1636.88 --> 1641.3600000000001
he's he watches ball busters

1639.12 --> 1643.1999999999998
at least sometimes maybe he gets

1641.36 --> 1646.7199999999998
forwarded like they're really good

1643.2 --> 1648.32
subjects when he's interested in looking

1646.72 --> 1650.159
into that specifically or something i

1648.32 --> 1653.4399999999998
don't know

1650.159 --> 1656.7990000000002
or maybe he just gets clips forwarded

1653.44 --> 1656.799
don't know what it is exactly

1658.96 --> 1662.96
but yeah that was a pretty awesome

1666.84 --> 1669.84
piece

1672.0 --> 1676.24
as oakley is laughing

1678.799 --> 1687.84
what are you talking about

1683.679 --> 1690.72
oh really so you you're telling me that

1687.84 --> 1692.1589999999999
ranty is gonna reveal other people's

1690.72 --> 1697.84
financial situation

1692.159 --> 1697.8400000000001
is he really

1699.6 --> 1705.76
how what how does he even know that [ __ ]

1708.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
i don't know thanks before this seems

1711.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
kind of desperate

1726.88 --> 1730.5590000000002
what do you mean clutch bear

1730.64 --> 1735.1200000000001
he if he die who who are you talking

1736.84 --> 1739.84
about

1741.039 --> 1745.44
yeah and this is where you can get the

1742.96 --> 1745.44
[ __ ] out

1748.32 --> 1753.84
hello five from donors

1778.84 --> 1781.84
so

1787.36 --> 1795.12
well like if it is a statistics about

1791.2 --> 1798.72
nathan's finances

1795.12 --> 1801.6789999999999
i don't know maybe there is a curve in

1798.72 --> 1801.679
the in the stats

1802.32 --> 1809.84
i get the feeling nathan does sometimes

1804.32 --> 1809.84
do really good

1816.32 --> 1820.559
well nathan it all depends on what the

1819.12 --> 1822.799
what the

1820.559 --> 1824.08
the shaming objective is right because

1822.799 --> 1827.44
they can go both

1824.08 --> 1828.799
can go both ways if right it's actually

1827.44 --> 1830.72
going to happen

1828.799 --> 1832.8799999999999
now look at me entertaining or

1830.72 --> 1833.84
predicting about what will happen it's

1832.88 --> 1836.72
quite silly

1833.84 --> 1838.72
so they can go either way they can tell

1836.72 --> 1841.279
talk about your situation and

1838.72 --> 1843.3600000000001
how poor you are and that is because of

1841.279 --> 1844.96
course flat earth is dying and it's

1843.36 --> 1846.9599999999998
unsuccessful and that's why you're

1844.96 --> 1850.08
barely getting around

1846.96 --> 1852.3990000000001
right like me or oh

1850.08 --> 1854.799
nathan oakley's actually doing really

1852.399 --> 1856.8799999999999
well and he's hoarding money

1854.799 --> 1858.799
and he's evil and he's trying to

1856.88 --> 1861.0390000000002
manipulate everybody into giving him

1858.799 --> 1864.24
money that's why he is so rich right

1861.039 --> 1867.519
so yeah either way they can lit

1864.24 --> 1870.64
they could even switch it around mid

1867.519 --> 1871.679
mid show and and the ballast would still

1870.64 --> 1873.679
just bite

1871.679 --> 1875.2
right there even though it's a 180

1873.679 --> 1877.76
degrees

1875.2 --> 1879.6000000000001
because it doesn't really matter from a

1877.76 --> 1881.76
financial perspective

1879.6 --> 1882.9599999999998
either you're really poor because flat

1881.76 --> 1885.039
earth is stupid

1882.96 --> 1887.1200000000001
or you're really rich because you're

1885.039 --> 1889.44
evil and you're actually trying to

1887.12 --> 1890.559
manipulate flat earthers into giving

1889.44 --> 1894.3990000000001
your money right

1890.559 --> 1897.9189999999999
so from that baller perspective

1894.399 --> 1897.9189999999999
like yeah

1898.32 --> 1902.0
whatever your financial situation is as

1900.64 --> 1905.279
a flat earther

1902.0 --> 1908.88
you can never do it right right

1905.279 --> 1909.6
the only correct way is to suck up to

1908.88 --> 1912.3990000000001
the system

1909.6 --> 1916.7199999999998
be a really disgusting troll piece of

1912.399 --> 1919.4399999999998
[ __ ] liar politician statist apologist

1916.72 --> 1920.48
and then receive a whole bunch of shill

1919.44 --> 1923.8400000000001
money

1920.48 --> 1925.919
right that's the only correct way

1923.84 --> 1927.4399999999998
to live in this world according to

1925.919 --> 1930.48
ballers right

1927.44 --> 1932.159
that's that's the dream it's the baller

1930.48 --> 1934.0
dream

1932.159 --> 1935.519
you suck up to the system and they give

1934.0 --> 1937.2
you a whole bunch of money and now

1935.519 --> 1940.3990000000001
you're the special boy and now you can

1937.2 --> 1942.0800000000002
tell everybody else how stupid they are

1940.399 --> 1949.84
for not doing what you did to get a

1942.08 --> 1949.84
whole lot of money

1960.08 --> 1966.8799999999999
lambo it's

1963.679 --> 1966.88
ridiculous nathan

1970.08 --> 1973.1999999999998
we all know your wife would never let

1971.679 --> 1977.8400000000001
you buy a lamborghini

1973.2 --> 1977.8400000000001
even if you could

1995.039 --> 2019.84
what the [ __ ]

2004.08 --> 2019.84
ooh a car goody

2030.84 --> 2033.84
uh

2051.599 --> 2055.9190000000003
of course newton that i just explained

2054.56 --> 2058.159
that

2055.919 --> 2058.1589999999997
right

2059.2 --> 2062.6389999999997
but you got a point they they are

2061.679 --> 2065.599
probably

2062.639 --> 2067.119
doing that bending the attention on you

2065.599 --> 2069.839
specifically because

2067.119 --> 2070.48
they now have something that to hide so

2069.839 --> 2072.96
they

2070.48 --> 2075.839
need an opportunity to be able to

2072.96 --> 2077.599
project all the things that they've

2075.839 --> 2079.44
been going through and that they know

2077.599 --> 2081.3590000000004
about themselves that they're trying to

2079.44 --> 2082.639
keep secret and need to project it onto

2081.359 --> 2086.0789999999997
somebody else to

2082.639 --> 2090.079
to therapeutically get rid of it

2086.079 --> 2090.079
it's like chant projecting

2090.399 --> 2094.7999999999997
you the batman like oh you did something

2092.48 --> 2096.079
terrible oh just project it on somebody

2094.8 --> 2099.599
else start spewing

2096.079 --> 2099.599
accusations towards them

2100.56 --> 2103.839
it's really disgusting

2104.16 --> 2109.2
when people do that really really bad

2110.64 --> 2117.839
has it ever had that before

2114.839 --> 2117.839
what

2127.599 --> 2131.839
somebody drove round the court

2134.72 --> 2138.0789999999997
making gun sounds

2139.599 --> 2143.44
what are you talking about five from the

2141.68 --> 2148.56
i don't know where you're from

2143.44 --> 2148.56
and no i've never had that before

2154.56 --> 2159.839
oh if yes share your pain

2161.359 --> 2164.48
start projecting

2171.839 --> 2178.64
all right let the projection initiate

2176.079 --> 2180.2400000000002
sock troll of person who is trying to

2178.64 --> 2183.1189999999997
stay anonymous

2180.24 --> 2184.16
which falls under dodgy nathan oakley

2183.119 --> 2187.04
not doing so

2184.16 --> 2189.44
having his own account having being on

2187.04 --> 2192.32
face on camera

2189.44 --> 2195.04
being persistently there not dodgy so

2192.32 --> 2201.839
thanks for projecting that

2195.04 --> 2201.839
silly little sock

2211.04 --> 2216.16
although a dodge might actually be a

2213.28 --> 2216.1600000000003
pretty awesome car

2218.72 --> 2229.839
might want to go for that if you're

2220.8 --> 2229.8390000000004
engaging in choosing some kind of a car

2233.52 --> 2237.28
right like a dodge challenger or

2235.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
something

2237.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
a pretty epic car

2247.04 --> 2250.16
all right and then anybody that's gonna

2248.8 --> 2252.32
call you dodgy you're

2250.16 --> 2257.839
you can simply rebut them with yeah i

2252.32 --> 2257.839
have a dodge

2259.839 --> 2262.24
anyway

2267.839 --> 2289.92
yeah i know right rest ahead totally

2285.28 --> 2289.92
yeah that sailor but look by now

2290.48 --> 2294.56
look nathan has a very distinct face

2293.04 --> 2297.2799999999997
right and a distinct

2294.56 --> 2298.0789999999997
way he composes his facial expression

2297.28 --> 2300.96
it's interesting

2298.079 --> 2303.28
hey i met him in person nathan you are

2300.96 --> 2306.8
an interesting person

2303.28 --> 2307.92
but especially because of your attitude

2306.8 --> 2309.8390000000004
and association

2307.92 --> 2312.16
of you showing your face on the flat

2309.839 --> 2315.7599999999998
earth debate in the middle of it

2312.16 --> 2319.2
you're just very trickery like

2315.76 --> 2321.599
your face which is quite unique is very

2319.2 --> 2324.0
triggering to a whole lot of people

2321.599 --> 2325.599
in a way you're like the trump of flat

2324.0 --> 2329.76
earth like that

2325.599 --> 2332.32
you really are you do know that right

2329.76 --> 2332.96
like you are such a trump of flat earth

2332.32 --> 2335.92
that there's

2332.96 --> 2338.2400000000002
like the savages out there in flat earth

2335.92 --> 2341.28
that have been around for a long time

2338.24 --> 2344.16
they're kind of envious of how

2341.28 --> 2344.6400000000003
how triggering you get to ballers in a

2344.16 --> 2346.72
way

2344.64 --> 2348.4
and then of course not envious because

2346.72 --> 2350.3199999999997
they don't actually want that sort of

2348.4 --> 2354.7200000000003
attention that bad or maybe they do

2350.32 --> 2358.48
but anyway yeah so i

2354.72 --> 2358.48
didn't mean it as an insult by the way

2362.079 --> 2365.8390000000004
the goat okay

2366.48 --> 2369.839
don't forget yeah of course

2391.68 --> 2399.7599999999998
now unicorn laser eyes yeah yeah

2397.7 --> 2403.04
[Music]

2399.76 --> 2406.3190000000004
well maybe look unicorn lazy maybe

2403.04 --> 2408.16
maybe ranty just lost his drone because

2406.319 --> 2410.319
he flew it up too high

2408.16 --> 2411.2
and then he forgot about the coriolis

2410.319 --> 2413.2799999999997
effect

2411.2 --> 2415.68
and then it just flew to another

2413.28 --> 2418.8
continent out of radio reach

2415.68 --> 2424.16
right maybe randy lost his drone because

2418.8 --> 2426.319
of the coriolis effect ah ranty

2424.16 --> 2429.68
you might use that ballers might be

2426.319 --> 2432.079
stupid enough to fall for that

2429.68 --> 2434.72
right you're a baller now right so you

2432.079 --> 2436.6400000000003
have to believe in the coriolis effect

2434.72 --> 2438.16
in the deviation of things because

2436.64 --> 2439.92
they're hovering above the earth which

2438.16 --> 2441.839
is spinning underneath it

2439.92 --> 2443.839
so maybe that's the way you lost the

2441.839 --> 2446.48
drone right just admit it right as a

2443.839 --> 2448.319
flat earther you had no justification

2446.48 --> 2450.2400000000002
because that couldn't happen right

2448.319 --> 2452.96
well now you're a baller so you can just

2450.24 --> 2455.04
say yeah i flew my drone up high

2452.96 --> 2456.8
and then i forgot about the coriolis

2455.04 --> 2460.48
deviation and it flew off

2456.8 --> 2462.7200000000003
way like to france or something

2460.48 --> 2467.839
or the other direction which one which

2462.72 --> 2467.839
direction should be flying

2470.48 --> 2475.04
west right so yeah you lost it somewhere

2474.319 --> 2477.7599999999998
on the

2475.04 --> 2480.4
on the west coast of ireland you could

2477.76 --> 2482.6400000000003
just say that

2480.4 --> 2482.64
right

2485.119 --> 2488.8
[ __ ] i might have just given ranty a

2487.04 --> 2495.839
really good

2488.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
silly thing to do but whatever man

2520.839 --> 2523.839
so

2526.079 --> 2529.44
find randy's camera

2534.4 --> 2542.2400000000002
right exactly stuff right

2537.599 --> 2544.96
it has a limited radio reach

2542.24 --> 2546.72
and it's supposed to like move with a

2544.96 --> 2549.28
thousand miles an hour that's

2546.72 --> 2550.48
quite a quick distance so if you just

2549.28 --> 2553.6800000000003
float it upward

2550.48 --> 2555.28
and like hey why is it going to that

2553.68 --> 2558.7999999999997
direction and then you

2555.28 --> 2560.7200000000003
can keep up and then it just

2558.8 --> 2562.8390000000004
moves out of reach and then it's the oh

2560.72 --> 2565.52
lost signal and he was so embarrassed

2562.839 --> 2568.4
because that couldn't happen because the

2565.52 --> 2570.64
earth is flat and stationary right

2568.4 --> 2572.2400000000002
yeah i don't know why i'm literally

2570.64 --> 2574.48
fabricating his total

2572.24 --> 2576.8799999999997
excuse lie that he could use to actually

2574.48 --> 2579.359
justify anything about it

2576.88 --> 2580.48
in a comedic way i don't even know why

2579.359 --> 2583.12
i'm doing that but

2580.48 --> 2584.2400000000002
i just thought about that [ __ ]

2583.12 --> 2587.7599999999998
[Music]

2584.24 --> 2589.68
it's just so stupid though

2587.76 --> 2591.44
but hey the ballers would buy it and

2589.68 --> 2607.839
that's his objective right he wants to

2591.44 --> 2607.839
fool the ballers well there you go

2619.119 --> 2624.48
for fun well that's

2622.16 --> 2624.48
how

2628.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
you know that's already been tried

2630.319 --> 2635.839
before right

2641.599 --> 2649.839
oh man time has flown crazy

2660.839 --> 2663.839
so

2675.2 --> 2678.56
yeah i know stopping traffic in my rasta

2677.359 --> 2681.44
hat i know that

2678.56 --> 2682.319
but remember with the situation where

2681.44 --> 2685.92
the money was

2682.319 --> 2685.92
supposed to go to roxanne

2686.56 --> 2696.0789999999997
and tony tried to sue over it

2690.88 --> 2696.079
and then ranty got his way so yeah

2697.52 --> 2705.839
it's not as easy

2700.56 --> 2709.68
to actually use the law

2705.839 --> 2709.68
to settle those types of things

2716.839 --> 2719.839
unfortunately

2729.76 --> 2733.6800000000003
what are you talking about here we go

2731.599 --> 2737.52
again

2733.68 --> 2747.839
btc mining controllers

2737.52 --> 2747.839
can't afford it what

2760.56 --> 2767.839
the drone was a different situation

2764.319 --> 2775.839
okay well

2767.839 --> 2775.839
it may not be that different though

2777.92 --> 2784.96
right because did ranty in his

2781.76 --> 2788.0
financing campaign for that drone

2784.96 --> 2789.839
did he lay out specifically a plan

2788.0 --> 2791.04
of the things he was going to do with

2789.839 --> 2793.52
the drone

2791.04 --> 2794.079
right because if that was like part of

2793.52 --> 2796.88
the

2794.079 --> 2797.599
promise system that he had officially

2796.88 --> 2801.119
put there

2797.599 --> 2804.48
in order to get the money

2801.119 --> 2806.88
then yeah he could be somehow

2804.48 --> 2807.839
legally bound to actually uphold the the

2806.88 --> 2810.48
promises

2807.839 --> 2811.52
right but if it's just blah blah blah

2810.48 --> 2814.96
and he just said no

2811.52 --> 2817.119
just help me the drone and no actual

2814.96 --> 2820.2400000000002
official promises

2817.119 --> 2821.04
then yeah whatever he blabbers on on his

2820.24 --> 2822.72
show

2821.04 --> 2824.079
that's not gonna hold water

2822.72 --> 2826.16
unfortunately

2824.079 --> 2828.8390000000004
just like it didn't in the situation

2826.16 --> 2831.52
with roxanne

2828.839 --> 2833.359
right

2831.52 --> 2835.119
there's not real if he just blabbers

2833.359 --> 2836.7999999999997
about something in the moment that's not

2835.119 --> 2838.079
something you can pin him down on

2836.8 --> 2841.28
because

2838.079 --> 2844.319
that blabbering was not literally part

2841.28 --> 2847.92
of the finance gathering campaign

2844.319 --> 2849.839
like off the page of the gofundme

2847.92 --> 2851.44
so then you can't really pin him down on

2849.839 --> 2854.5589999999997
that

2851.44 --> 2859.839
legally i don't know i might be wrong

2854.559 --> 2859.8390000000004
but that's how i think it works

2866.079 --> 2870.079
he said he was going to scotland so he

2868.72 --> 2872.48
said that but

2870.079 --> 2874.88
was that written down in the gofundme

2872.48 --> 2874.88
page

2878.48 --> 2882.559
right that matters everything

2883.44 --> 2888.96
what were the exact promises on the

2886.079 --> 2891.119
donating page

2888.96 --> 2892.4
because that is kind of like the reason

2891.119 --> 2894.4
people donate

2892.4 --> 2895.92
right so if there's a promise and people

2894.4 --> 2897.04
don't it well then there might be some

2895.92 --> 2900.0
legal

2897.04 --> 2902.8
accountability there if it's just like

2900.0 --> 2905.28
blank like oh get me the drone

2902.8 --> 2907.04
then technically people donating don't

2905.28 --> 2907.52
have anything to hold on to it's just

2907.04 --> 2909.119
helping

2907.52 --> 2910.88
ranty get the drone and if he then

2909.119 --> 2912.079
chooses to sell it and not even tell

2910.88 --> 2914.48
anybody about it

2912.079 --> 2915.28
yeah what can you do you just gave it

2914.48 --> 2918.319
him

2915.28 --> 2920.1600000000003
just like that no promises

2918.319 --> 2922.16
and whatever he blabbers on about

2920.16 --> 2924.3999999999996
separately on his channel that has

2922.16 --> 2926.7999999999997
technically nothing to do with it or not

2924.4 --> 2926.8
enough

2927.28 --> 2943.8390000000004
as the previous situation

2930.8 --> 2943.8390000000004
or the situation with roxanne revealed

2954.839 --> 2957.839
whatever

2979.92 --> 2986.88
here we go dude yeah

2984.0 --> 2987.76
but randy exposed who he was long before

2986.88 --> 2990.7200000000003
that

2987.76 --> 2991.92
i i tried to expose who he was at the

2990.72 --> 2993.839
time

2991.92 --> 2995.6800000000003
because he was doing a lot of he was

2993.839 --> 2999.2
just fawning

2995.68 --> 3002.48
darkness [ __ ] and just like oh

2999.2 --> 3004.96
let's play with them

3002.48 --> 3006.8
let's play with our audi he like showed

3004.96 --> 3009.28
that sort of [ __ ]

3006.8 --> 3012.079
like even when there wasn't any

3009.28 --> 3016.0
recording like in the after after panel

3012.079 --> 3019.52
and all that so already knew that

3016.0 --> 3020.4
like the guy is shady and apparently

3019.52 --> 3023.839
that's not just

3020.4 --> 3027.839
a temporary moon it's a long term thing

3023.839 --> 3031.2799999999997
that he was kind of suppressing

3027.839 --> 3033.119
to to fit in better that was the real

3031.28 --> 3033.6800000000003
situation not the other way around it's

3033.119 --> 3036.7200000000003
not

3033.68 --> 3038.7999999999997
something that he just developed no

3036.72 --> 3040.24
he was like that and he was actually

3038.8 --> 3043.28
from the beginning on

3040.24 --> 3055.839
suppressing it to kind of fit in

3043.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
so he is just a shady person

3064.48 --> 3069.839
i don't know what you're talking about

3066.0 --> 3069.839
unicorn laser eyes

3071.599 --> 3076.7200000000003
hmm you heard of the leaky tread

3076.88 --> 3086.73
all right

3082.01 --> 3086.73
[Music]

3094.839 --> 3097.839
so

3103.599 --> 3110.079
yeah stone monkey 3d i i actually

3106.72 --> 3114.0
explained that

3110.079 --> 3114.0
like 10 minutes ago or more

3115.119 --> 3119.28
like he could after that as an excuse

3117.44 --> 3121.92
for losing his drone he took it up too

3119.28 --> 3121.92
high and then

3122.48 --> 3126.0
like this stationary air in the upper

3125.04 --> 3128.96
layers

3126.0 --> 3131.119
just caused it to go out of radio reach

3128.96 --> 3133.28
and he lost it somewhere off the coast

3131.119 --> 3137.04
of ireland

3133.28 --> 3141.3590000000004
presumably because that's

3137.04 --> 3141.359
where it would take it right

3142.72 --> 3153.839
but so far he just doesn't mention

3144.559 --> 3153.8390000000004
anything about it

3159.119 --> 3161.44
hmm

3163.68 --> 3169.2
hey seeking stopwater did i miss you

3179.44 --> 3181.92
what the

3182.88 --> 3195.839
i don't see her in chat

3201.44 --> 3209.839
find ranty's drone

3216.64 --> 3223.839
you seek ng shelf i can't see it

3224.48 --> 3227.52
seeking i'm

3227.599 --> 3229.76
not

3232.079 --> 3237.8390000000004
i don't see her

3247.52 --> 3251.839
it's like all the way at the beginning

3249.119 --> 3251.839
or something

3263.92 --> 3267.04
no i don't know what you're talking

3265.68 --> 3269.839
about

3267.04 --> 3269.839
here we go again

3270.4 --> 3276.48
she is in well she hasn't left any

3273.76 --> 3276.48
message here

3277.04 --> 3284.5589999999997
in my chat i'll refresh to make sure

3281.359 --> 3286.72
something weird going on maybe no no

3284.559 --> 3289.8390000000004
she's not there

3286.72 --> 3291.52
maybe she's watching but i don't see her

3289.839 --> 3293.839
in chat so i don't know where you got

3291.52 --> 3293.839
that

3307.359 --> 3309.5989999999997
nope

3315.599 --> 3326.559
oh there you are

3321.76 --> 3326.559
so you just right after came in okay

3330.16 --> 3334.96
phone was dead all right

3333.2 --> 3336.5589999999997
like did you communicate with seeking

3334.96 --> 3338.64
star wars over skype

3336.559 --> 3349.8390000000004
before because this is the first time

3338.64 --> 3349.839
she spoke up in my chat so

3352.88 --> 3358.6400000000003
coriolis would take two months to get

3355.28 --> 3358.6400000000003
randy's drone to ireland

3360.839 --> 3377.839
no

3362.72 --> 3377.839
hold much much faster

3379.04 --> 3386.88
remember that the earth spins

3383.76 --> 3390.7200000000003
in an entire day right

3386.88 --> 3394.0
24 hours so no

3390.72 --> 3397.359
any object when high up enough presuming

3394.0 --> 3397.359
the earth is a spinning ball

3397.68 --> 3402.0
can circle the earth in an entire day

3400.079 --> 3403.8390000000004
just standing still

3402.0 --> 3407.52
so why are where are you getting this

3403.839 --> 3407.52
two months from that makes no sense

3408.72 --> 3411.7599999999998
that's what it would take it would take

3410.48 --> 3414.88
one mile high well

3411.76 --> 3419.8390000000004
yeah well maybe he took it higher

3414.88 --> 3419.839
much higher who knows

3422.48 --> 3428.799
that's not what coryell yeah coriolis

3426.079 --> 3429.52
is the presumed spinning ball earth

3428.799 --> 3432.96
spinning

3429.52 --> 3435.839
underneath everything else including the

3432.96 --> 3439.76
gas that's not susceptible by momentum

3435.839 --> 3439.7599999999998
so that keeps stationary

3442.24 --> 3450.24
right that's what your model demands

3447.76 --> 3451.8390000000004
so anything at ground level even up to

3450.24 --> 3454.0789999999997
one mile high then you

3451.839 --> 3456.799
considerably maybe the mountains will

3454.079 --> 3459.2000000000003
kind of help

3456.799 --> 3460.079
cause a little push on it so that it

3459.2 --> 3464.319
won't spin

3460.079 --> 3468.48
as much over the or yeah

3464.319 --> 3471.119
that it may be going a little bit with

3468.48 --> 3471.839
the earth spin but yeah definitely

3471.119 --> 3474.48
higher up

3471.839 --> 3475.7599999999998
no there's nothing to push against the

3474.48 --> 3478.88
air in order to cause

3475.76 --> 3482.0
local air pressure differential

3478.88 --> 3489.839
right it's just gonna sit still

3482.0 --> 3489.839
as the earth spins underneath it

3492.72 --> 3498.319
that's not what coriolis is an apparent

3495.52 --> 3498.319
deviation

3501.44 --> 3506.2400000000002
based from a vantage point of

3504.559 --> 3507.92
the observer thinking that they're

3506.24 --> 3509.52
standing still when they're actually the

3507.92 --> 3512.16
one that are moving

3509.52 --> 3513.2
right that's the coriolis that's car

3512.16 --> 3517.839
it's basically an

3513.2 --> 3517.839
interpretation effect

3521.839 --> 3527.92
basically coriolis is saying okay that

3524.96 --> 3527.92
thing is spinning

3528.16 --> 3533.359
from my viewpoint but in actuality that

3531.68 --> 3534.0789999999997
thing is standing still and i'm the one

3533.359 --> 3536.64
that's spinning

3534.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
that's the coriolis effect that's like

3536.64 --> 3545.839
the only thing it actually is

3546.64 --> 3552.16
yes it is stone monkey 3d

3550.4 --> 3553.76
you don't seem to understand what the

3552.16 --> 3557.359
coriolis effect is now

3553.76 --> 3560.0400000000004
there is of course the nonsense

3557.359 --> 3561.359
google version come rolling out of

3560.04 --> 3563.68
heliocentrist

3561.359 --> 3564.799
[ __ ] right that's not actually

3563.68 --> 3568.3999999999996
physics

3564.799 --> 3571.2
if you just look up the coriolis effect

3568.4 --> 3573.52
it first describes mechanically what it

3571.2 --> 3575.4399999999996
is and then it starts to insert all the

3573.52 --> 3577.359
[ __ ]

3575.44 --> 3579.119
that is actually something else that

3577.359 --> 3581.2799999999997
doesn't match

3579.119 --> 3582.88
the original description of what

3581.28 --> 3586.0
coriolis effect is

3582.88 --> 3589.28
at all like at all it suddenly becomes

3586.0 --> 3590.64
a side effect of motion it starts to

3589.28 --> 3594.4
claim

3590.64 --> 3596.4
some kind of turbulence right actual

3594.4 --> 3598.1600000000003
displacement because of something well

3596.4 --> 3600.1600000000003
that has nothing to do with coriolis

3598.16 --> 3615.839
effect coriolis effect is only

3600.16 --> 3615.839
an apparent deviation

3616.559 --> 3623.0400000000004
if there's an actual deviation

3620.0 --> 3625.28
a direct cause of the coriolis effect

3623.04 --> 3629.7599999999998
claim then it's not the coriolis effect

3625.28 --> 3631.94
the coriolis effect doesn't do anything

3629.76 --> 3635.119
it's not the cause of anything

3631.94 --> 3635.119
[Music]

3636.079 --> 3643.92
it's just yeah

3639.28 --> 3643.92
a viewpoint interpretation of an

3647.04 --> 3650.15
[Music]

3654.839 --> 3657.839
observer

3704.079 --> 3709.28
so no rebuttal to that then i guess

3707.839 --> 3712.0789999999997
because yeah your first statement

3709.28 --> 3714.1600000000003
coriolis is caused by earth spin it is

3712.079 --> 3716.319
not earth spinning under something

3714.16 --> 3720.0
that's just blatantly

3716.319 --> 3723.44
error it's wrong it's wrong

3720.0 --> 3727.68
right it's exactly the opposite no it is

3723.44 --> 3731.28
caused by the earth spinning underneath

3727.68 --> 3741.839
the apparent deviation observed is

3731.28 --> 3741.8390000000004
the coriolis effect

3748.799 --> 3752.839
right yeah even calling it a coriolis

3750.799 --> 3754.799
force is

3752.839 --> 3756.799
self-contradicting like it has nothing

3754.799 --> 3760.319
to do with the force it doesn't

3756.799 --> 3763.359
apply to force mechanics there is no

3760.319 --> 3766.839
energy it isn't the force the

3763.359 --> 3768.16
interpretation of a force is based on

3766.839 --> 3771.2799999999997
the

3768.16 --> 3775.359
the interpretation mistake of something

3771.28 --> 3778.6800000000003
actually being propelled by a force

3775.359 --> 3781.68
right that's literally a erroneous

3778.68 --> 3784.72
interpretation the calling it a force

3781.68 --> 3788.319
is is a

3784.72 --> 3790.319
like a catalogued misinterpretation of

3788.319 --> 3793.16
what is actually going on

3790.319 --> 3794.799
so calling it a coriolis force is almost

3793.16 --> 3796.64
self-contradicting

3794.799 --> 3797.92
because there is no actual force

3796.64 --> 3800.0789999999997
happening

3797.92 --> 3801.44
that's not why something is deviating

3800.079 --> 3806.2400000000002
it's deviating because

3801.44 --> 3807.52
you're moving not the thing

3806.24 --> 3809.2799999999997
i always thought it was totally

3807.52 --> 3811.0389999999998
ridiculous that it even is called

3809.28 --> 3814.1600000000003
coriolis force because it has

3811.039 --> 3817.119
absolutely nothing to do with the force

3814.16 --> 3817.1189999999997
quite the opposite

3822.839 --> 3839.839
right

3824.64 --> 3839.839
hello guns have never owned rmp

3850.16 --> 3854.8799999999997
oh shearer stone monkey 3d well if you

3852.559 --> 3855.92
can have some actual demonstration of

3854.88 --> 3858.7200000000003
that

3855.92 --> 3860.2400000000002
standard deviation at one mile that

3858.72 --> 3866.8799999999997
would be very nice

3860.24 --> 3869.2799999999997
to see that

3866.88 --> 3871.6800000000003
i'd like to see a demonstration of that

3869.28 --> 3873.8390000000004
and then also taking into account that

3871.68 --> 3876.96
if that is the case then everything

3873.839 --> 3876.96
should be deviating

3877.2 --> 3881.2
because the earth is spinning underneath

3878.839 --> 3883.44
it

3881.2 --> 3886.48
right so that would shorten flight times

3883.44 --> 3886.48
etc etc

3887.2 --> 3893.4399999999996
you've heard it if i take it

3890.96 --> 3894.0
like hundreds or even thousands of times

3893.44 --> 3896.319
on nathan

3894.0 --> 3898.319
oakley's right like how many times do

3896.319 --> 3900.24
you need that to be explained

3898.319 --> 3902.64
if you're gonna claim an actual coriolis

3900.24 --> 3905.4399999999996
deviation

3902.64 --> 3905.92
then yeah with that claims with that

3905.44 --> 3908.88
claim

3905.92 --> 3910.88
comes all the other things that would

3908.88 --> 3912.7200000000003
have to deviate as well so where

3910.88 --> 3923.839
where's the deviation where's the flight

3912.72 --> 3923.839
time deviations etc

3948.839 --> 3951.839
hmm

3971.28 --> 3975.6800000000003
yeah that's a really nice theoretical

3974.0 --> 3979.28
claim

3975.68 --> 3983.5989999999997
stone monkey 3d but if it

3979.28 --> 3983.599
whatever it is would indeed be

3984.64 --> 3989.44
a quarter mile per round drift then

3987.599 --> 3992.6400000000003
where is that drift

3989.44 --> 3996.48
because yeah that counts

3992.64 --> 3998.96
that starts to add up so there would be

3996.48 --> 4007.839
flight time deviations for starters so

3998.96 --> 4007.839
where are they

4013.119 --> 4018.0
that is what no coriolis is an apparent

4018.839 --> 4024.0789999999997
deviation

4021.28 --> 4025.44
it's the misinterpretation of the

4024.079 --> 4027.119
observer

4025.44 --> 4029.359
that what they're looking at is

4027.119 --> 4031.6800000000003
deviating while it is actually

4029.359 --> 4032.48
they that are deviating while the thing

4031.68 --> 4035.5989999999997
they're looking at

4032.48 --> 4049.839
is standing still that's what coriolis

4035.599 --> 4049.839
effect is

4052.559 --> 4056.2400000000002
yeah that's what you're describing but

4054.319 --> 4060.16
you seem to have a little trouble

4056.24 --> 4062.16
actually figuring out that

4060.16 --> 4063.2
that's not the case though because

4062.16 --> 4066.799
things aren't

4063.2 --> 4069.2
drifting in the amounts that you say

4066.799 --> 4071.68
because then everything would be

4069.2 --> 4074.72
drifting up there everything

4071.68 --> 4077.0389999999998
including airplanes

4074.72 --> 4078.5589999999997
which would result in different flight

4077.039 --> 4081.6800000000003
times

4078.559 --> 4083.6800000000003
there aren't any deviations in flight

4081.68 --> 4084.72
times based on if they're going east or

4083.68 --> 4086.72
west

4084.72 --> 4091.839
therefore the earth is not spinning

4086.72 --> 4091.839
because there is no coriolis deviation

4099.6 --> 4103.279
now that's not true guns of nephron

4101.279 --> 4105.359
there is coriolis effect it's just

4103.279 --> 4107.839000000001
not coriolis effect due to the earth

4105.359 --> 4107.839
spinning

4108.239 --> 4118.639999999999
right but hey things spin in nature

4112.48 --> 4122.5599999999995
a wheel spins

4118.64 --> 4125.52
right things spin in nature

4122.56 --> 4126.319
and then there can be coriolis effect

4125.52 --> 4128.400000000001
because of it

4126.319 --> 4130.319
if you put the observer on the spinning

4128.4 --> 4132.4
thing

4130.319 --> 4134.96
but the earth itself is simply not

4132.4 --> 4134.96
spinning

4135.679 --> 4139.6
air is not bonded right now or as i like

4138.96 --> 4142.56
to say

4139.6 --> 4144.2390000000005
air gases are not susceptible to

4142.56 --> 4147.279
momentum

4144.239 --> 4147.839
they can't ever be made to move in lock

4147.279 --> 4150.96
step

4147.839 --> 4152.239
but they can respond to a local pressure

4150.96 --> 4154.64
differential

4152.239 --> 4155.3589999999995
if some physical thing is pushing

4154.64 --> 4157.4400000000005
against it

4155.359 --> 4158.839
and kind of forcing it to move it with

4157.44 --> 4161.839
the spin

4158.839 --> 4165.359
right but even that would cause some

4161.839 --> 4165.359
kind of gradating effect

4167.279 --> 4172.319
like a horizontal gradating effect well

4170.08 --> 4176.3189999999995
we don't see that

4172.319 --> 4179.279
you don't have higher pressure on

4176.319 --> 4181.04
west side of mountain ranges as you do

4179.279 --> 4183.279
on the east side right well if the earth

4181.04 --> 4185.359
was spinning in that direction

4183.279 --> 4187.1990000000005
there would be because it would be

4185.359 --> 4189.679
constantly pushing against that

4187.199 --> 4191.5199999999995
air layer that is attempting to stay

4189.679 --> 4193.4400000000005
stationary

4191.52 --> 4194.64
or attempt it is stained staying

4193.44 --> 4198.239
stationary but

4194.64 --> 4200.2390000000005
still responds to con yeah to pushing

4198.239 --> 4201.599999999999
of physical objects which would be the

4200.239 --> 4202.0
mountain ranges well there is no

4201.6 --> 4203.92
pressure

4202.0 --> 4205.36
differential on one side of the mountain

4203.92 --> 4208.8
range versus the other

4205.36 --> 4208.799999999999
because the earth is not spinning

4212.239 --> 4217.678999999999
right and i'm talking about constant

4214.48 --> 4220.4
that would be a constant thing

4217.679 --> 4222.0
because they look depending on weather

4220.4 --> 4224.08
situations yeah their

4222.0 --> 4226.32
pressure can build up on one side of the

4224.08 --> 4229.679
mountain and storms and all that

4226.32 --> 4231.5199999999995
but it would always be constant on top

4229.679 --> 4234.96
of whatever else happens

4231.52 --> 4235.76
it isn't pressure is usually just the

4234.96 --> 4238.08
same on

4235.76 --> 4239.76
both sides if the weather is cleared up

4238.08 --> 4240.64
that would not be the case if the earth

4239.76 --> 4242.400000000001
were spinning

4240.64 --> 4244.4800000000005
then there would always be more pressure

4242.4 --> 4246.719
on one side of a mountain ranges on the

4244.48 --> 4246.718999999999
other

4250.8 --> 4253.84
and there would be a constant gill going

4253.199 --> 4256.4
going

4253.84 --> 4257.1990000000005
over the tops of the mountain range at

4256.4 --> 4259.04
all times

4257.199 --> 4261.759999999999
would always be wind the wind would

4259.04 --> 4261.76
never stop

4270.84 --> 4273.84
huh

4278.43 --> 4282.249000000001
[Music]

4283.92 --> 4290.719
atmosphere effect

4287.679 --> 4292.8
affects planes more than cro yeah but

4290.719 --> 4295.04
that doesn't exclude that there are

4292.8 --> 4296.56
actually affected by coriolis and would

4295.04 --> 4298.96
be at all times

4296.56 --> 4301.52
right yeah other effects that's nice but

4298.96 --> 4304.0
you could definitely

4301.52 --> 4305.76
isolate the other effects wait till

4304.0 --> 4308.48
they're gone and then there would still

4305.76 --> 4313.52
be the coriolis deviation

4308.48 --> 4313.5199999999995
yeah well there isn't there isn't any

4313.679 --> 4317.04
right doesn't matter how how much in

4315.92 --> 4320.08
your mind you

4317.04 --> 4322.4
make it insignificant how much things

4320.08 --> 4325.199
deviate due to coriolis effect assuming

4322.4 --> 4327.36
the earth is spinning underneath

4325.199 --> 4328.4
there would be a constant deviation no

4327.36 --> 4332.32
matter how little

4328.4 --> 4336.239
and it would be measurable at all time

4332.32 --> 4339.5199999999995
right so you you can't get

4336.239 --> 4340.799999999999
you can't get out of this either the

4339.52 --> 4343.360000000001
earth is spinning

4340.8 --> 4343.92
and there is coriolis deviation at all

4343.36 --> 4347.44
time

4343.92 --> 4357.34
in the air or there isn't

4347.44 --> 4360.539
and the earth is stationary

4357.34 --> 4360.539
[Music]

4365.04 --> 4368.32
no don't try to tell me what coriolis

4367.52 --> 4370.88
effect is

4368.32 --> 4372.719
you're just sounding like another

4370.88 --> 4374.56
trencher numpty

4372.719 --> 4377.12
series still monkey 3d is getting

4374.56 --> 4377.120000000001
tiresome

4380.96 --> 4385.36
appear to deviate with that yeah thanks

4383.04 --> 4388.56
yeah i know appear to deviate but

4385.36 --> 4391.36
no real force yeah i know i know

4388.56 --> 4392.080000000001
there's an issue though there isn't this

4391.36 --> 4394.5599999999995
deviation

4392.08 --> 4396.4
is not actually happening because all

4394.56 --> 4397.6
things would be deviating and flight

4396.4 --> 4402.239
times would be different

4397.6 --> 4405.679
east or westward right and they aren't

4402.239 --> 4405.678999999999
so maybe

4406.8 --> 4410.4800000000005
maybe the earth is not spinning and

4408.48 --> 4412.239
that's why we don't see this coriolis

4410.48 --> 4427.839999999999
deviation at all time have you ever

4412.239 --> 4427.839999999999
considered that stone monkey 3d

4439.28 --> 4442.639999999999
the lateral force

4446.56 --> 4452.080000000001
would that's an incomplete statement

4453.679 --> 4461.679
yeah when lateral forces

4458.4 --> 4464.239
do you mean to a plane earth or an

4461.679 --> 4469.84
airplane this is very incomplete

4464.239 --> 4469.839999999999
what you're saying now stone monkey 3d

4482.159 --> 4487.5199999999995
aircraft right yeah it's the what's

4484.4 --> 4492.159
seeking star wars already said it

4487.52 --> 4494.159000000001
it's the wings that cause

4492.159 --> 4496.08
that are basically effectively like a

4494.159 --> 4499.679
container a wall

4496.08 --> 4503.199
causing air pressure build up local

4499.679 --> 4507.679
air pressure differential that causes

4503.199 --> 4507.678999999999
the force on the hole causes the lift

4509.52 --> 4525.84
and keeps it up right that's all local

4512.8 --> 4525.84
air pressure differential

4541.76 --> 4545.52
are we gonna change the world for the

4543.679 --> 4548.2390000000005
better peeps well

4545.52 --> 4550.159000000001
don't just change yourself for the

4548.239 --> 4551.199
better and then hope that the world will

4550.159 --> 4554.239
actually

4551.199 --> 4554.639999999999
take an example that's the only no way i

4554.239 --> 4558.959999999999
know

4554.64 --> 4561.84
how to change the world every time

4558.96 --> 4563.679
you can't for force anybody to change

4561.84 --> 4566.96
you can't force

4563.679 --> 4568.4800000000005
anybody to realize something they don't

4566.96 --> 4571.12
want to realize

4568.48 --> 4573.759999999999
you can only make it very appealing for

4571.12 --> 4576.0
them to go there

4573.76 --> 4576.0
right

4578.64 --> 4582.88
or provide the confidence within the

4581.36 --> 4585.839999999999
example

4582.88 --> 4587.92
right you can only inspire the world to

4585.84 --> 4589.76
change you can't force it to change

4587.92 --> 4591.6
because then it it's going to change in

4589.76 --> 4595.679
a way different is what you

4591.6 --> 4598.400000000001
originally think

4595.679 --> 4600.8
usually you end up changing yourself for

4598.4 --> 4600.799999999999
the worse

4601.52 --> 4605.6
because if you're gonna show the world

4604.48 --> 4607.919999999999
that

4605.6 --> 4609.6
you think you can change it with force

4607.92 --> 4610.8
then either it's gonna take that as a

4609.6 --> 4613.52
bad example and

4610.8 --> 4615.92
start doing it itself or it's simply

4613.52 --> 4619.280000000001
gonna

4615.92 --> 4622.719
take your

4619.28 --> 4626.639999999999
view and intention as something bad

4622.719 --> 4626.64
and then actively resist it

4627.44 --> 4633.199
if you set an example

4630.88 --> 4634.08
that can appeal to people that aren't

4633.199 --> 4637.199
doing it

4634.08 --> 4651.84
then you might inspire

4637.199 --> 4651.839999999999
to try and do that too

4652.159 --> 4660.239
people push backward you change yourself

4655.199 --> 4660.239
it can get you banned no

4660.64 --> 4667.4400000000005
i right unless you're doing

4663.92 --> 4669.76
those things and have kind of like

4667.44 --> 4670.799999999999
gathered people and are reaping fruits

4669.76 --> 4673.52
from it

4670.8 --> 4674.320000000001
or squirt or whatever if you're doing

4673.52 --> 4677.280000000001
something

4674.32 --> 4678.88
really bad and people think that's cool

4677.28 --> 4679.759999999999
about you and that's how you get an

4678.88 --> 4681.36
audience

4679.76 --> 4683.280000000001
yeah if you try to better yourself and

4681.36 --> 4685.759999999999
then stop doing that there's going to be

4683.28 --> 4688.639999999999
a whole lot of people how dare you

4685.76 --> 4690.320000000001
we don't like you anymore now or now you

4688.64 --> 4693.52
suddenly make us feel bad

4690.32 --> 4695.5199999999995
right well that's because you got the

4693.52 --> 4698.320000000001
wrong audience in the first place

4695.52 --> 4698.320000000001
because of it

4699.12 --> 4701.36
right

4705.44 --> 4712.639999999999
if somebody was counting on you to sin

4709.44 --> 4713.5199999999995
and helped you because of that then if

4712.64 --> 4715.92
you

4713.52 --> 4717.360000000001
stop sinning yeah they will certainly

4715.92 --> 4720.64
take that as

4717.36 --> 4722.4
oh you're not

4720.64 --> 4724.08
then i'm not gonna help you anymore

4722.4 --> 4726.0
either or i'm gonna actually turn

4724.08 --> 4729.04
against you yeah that's what happens

4726.0 --> 4732.8
right so it's just the best to let let

4729.04 --> 4737.04
go as much sin as you can

4732.8 --> 4737.04
and don't worry about the pushback

4740.08 --> 4744.5599999999995
it's more about taking people with you

4742.64 --> 4748.56
to further purity and hope

4744.56 --> 4751.04
you bump into other people as well

4748.56 --> 4753.360000000001
that are doing the same thing and that

4751.04 --> 4756.0
will resonate with you because you do it

4753.36 --> 4756.96
right don't be concerned with those you

4756.0 --> 4760.159
leave behind

4756.96 --> 4763.199
in hell don't worry about them

4760.159 --> 4766.799999999999
right it's none of your concern just

4763.199 --> 4766.799999999999
try to stay out of it yourself

4773.36 --> 4777.28
and even by doing that and giving an

4775.76 --> 4780.4800000000005
example that you can't get out

4777.28 --> 4784.48
even those people you leave behind might

4780.48 --> 4787.759999999999
be inspired at some point to do it too

4784.48 --> 4790.799999999999
as long as you show that they can't

4787.76 --> 4792.56
drag you back down so long as they got

4790.8 --> 4794.4800000000005
the sensation that they have become

4792.56 --> 4796.8
isolated because of their sin and their

4794.48 --> 4797.599999999999
inability to let it go and you manage to

4796.8 --> 4799.360000000001
do it

4797.6 --> 4801.280000000001
then you might actually at some point

4799.36 --> 4803.839999999999
inspire them to do it too

4801.28 --> 4804.4
but if you let them drag you back in

4803.84 --> 4806.32
that's

4804.4 --> 4808.5599999999995
never going to happen right then it's

4806.32 --> 4810.48
going to be their game to drag you down

4808.56 --> 4813.679
instead

4810.48 --> 4814.799999999999
so you got to be careful with how you

4813.679 --> 4819.84
look at those things

4814.8 --> 4819.84
for yourself

4823.75 --> 4826.89
[Music]

4842.48 --> 4846.5599999999995
was there a live ball busters last week

4844.639 --> 4848.159000000001
yes there was guns nephron there was a

4846.56 --> 4848.96
live ball busters and there was a live

4848.159 --> 4852.799999999999
qe live

4848.96 --> 4855.44
show on tuesday there's no

4852.8 --> 4856.719
uh ball busters live as far as i know

4855.44 --> 4859.12
this saturday

4856.719 --> 4860.32
like today there isn't any so it's going

4859.12 --> 4863.92
to be a bit of an

4860.32 --> 4865.92
uneventful day i guess maybe some

4863.92 --> 4867.04
ranty [ __ ] or whatever is going to go

4865.92 --> 4870.4
down

4867.04 --> 4872.48
i don't know which city

4870.4 --> 4875.44
versus ranty or something was that today

4872.48 --> 4878.5599999999995
or was it tomorrow i don't know

4875.44 --> 4889.839999999999
but no ball busters

4878.56 --> 4889.84
avery a replay probably

4896.4 --> 4899.679
yeah i know here we go again i i i've

4899.04 --> 4901.44
literally

4899.679 --> 4903.28
experienced that with people that

4901.44 --> 4905.04
directly serve that i thought were my

4903.28 --> 4908.159
friends then they actually turned out to

4905.04 --> 4908.159
be my gatekeepers

4908.8 --> 4914.0
that would literally pull me down in

4911.04 --> 4915.6
moments of enlightenment of realization

4914.0 --> 4917.6
they wouldn't take it as a cue as like

4915.6 --> 4920.08
oh finally some of us

4917.6 --> 4921.92
have opened the gate let's go through an

4920.08 --> 4924.0
ascend no they took it as

4921.92 --> 4926.159
that's bad you're not supposed to do

4924.0 --> 4929.44
that and then couldn't rationalize it

4926.159 --> 4933.04
and would turn totally evil

4929.44 --> 4937.839999999999
like that's not a baller excuse

4933.04 --> 4937.84
or like a baller exclusive type of

4942.84 --> 4948.32
response

4945.76 --> 4950.08
right and that's when i realized that i

4948.32 --> 4950.48
would eventually would have to let them

4950.08 --> 4954.48
go

4950.48 --> 4956.48
and i did i'm completely cut off

4954.48 --> 4958.32
unfortunately though i haven't really

4956.48 --> 4959.759999999999
found a

4958.32 --> 4961.599999999999
group of people in my direct

4959.76 --> 4963.52
surroundings to replace it with and

4961.6 --> 4965.92
instead i've replaced it with people on

4963.52 --> 4969.52
the internet

4965.92 --> 4971.1990000000005
but yeah that's different gave me a lot

4969.52 --> 4973.92
of room

4971.199 --> 4975.919999999999
in a certain way i can put down a lot

4973.92 --> 4979.12
more about myself

4975.92 --> 4981.92
don't have to adapt as meticulously to

4979.12 --> 4984.96
the situation in the individual

4981.92 --> 4987.4400000000005
this way but

4984.96 --> 4989.199
yeah because i was never really a star

4987.44 --> 4992.48
at that part

4989.199 --> 4994.799999999999
i lost a lot of practice in that

4992.48 --> 4997.28
and effectively i'm a like a

4994.8 --> 5000.08
face-to-face hermit now

4997.28 --> 5001.92
on the internet i communicate plenty but

5000.08 --> 5004.159
out there

5001.92 --> 5005.52
not so much i've never been a star at it

5004.159 --> 5009.759999999999
and

5005.52 --> 5011.76
like i'm less good now

5009.76 --> 5015.52
but it's only because of like energy

5011.76 --> 5018.320000000001
dynamics it's because of the confidence

5015.52 --> 5018.320000000001
and just the

5019.28 --> 5024.88
just the crazy spiritual evolutions and

5022.56 --> 5026.320000000001
the evolutions that have gone on out

5024.88 --> 5028.96
there

5026.32 --> 5029.44
i can't adapt to that [ __ ] anymore i

5028.96 --> 5033.84
can't

5029.44 --> 5037.12
adapt to the people that are around

5033.84 --> 5039.52
i can't do it like i it's just like an

5037.12 --> 5039.92
atrocity and and they don't even know it

5039.52 --> 5042.159000000001
and

5039.92 --> 5044.639
like i can't even blame them really it's

5042.159 --> 5044.638999999999
just that

5045.44 --> 5049.5199999999995
i just can't connect with people anymore

5047.6 --> 5057.52
not really

5049.52 --> 5059.76
like on a personal level right

5057.52 --> 5061.76
i'm not gonna say that that means it's

5059.76 --> 5063.4400000000005
cut off forever

5061.76 --> 5064.88
i know there will be individuals there

5063.44 --> 5066.96
are some individuals

5064.88 --> 5068.32
that i still very much connect to but

5066.96 --> 5071.52
it's just so

5068.32 --> 5075.599999999999
rare now for me it's really like

5071.52 --> 5079.52
i'm just one of the few mages

5075.6 --> 5081.52
or something and there's like maybe

5079.52 --> 5083.360000000001
maybe a hundred of them in the entire

5081.52 --> 5085.040000000001
world that's what it feels like to me

5083.36 --> 5087.679
now

5085.04 --> 5090.0
right maybe a hundred other mages

5087.679 --> 5091.84
they're in the same predicament probably

5090.0 --> 5093.76
suffering even more

5091.84 --> 5096.56
this sounds so dramatic but they

5093.76 --> 5096.56
probably are

5096.84 --> 5099.84
right

5100.159 --> 5106.48
and and yeah the rest is there's like

5103.28 --> 5109.04
a million grapplers

5106.48 --> 5109.919999999999
that are trying to emulate it and trying

5109.04 --> 5112.8
to get the

5109.92 --> 5113.4400000000005
and trying to take you over take control

5112.8 --> 5116.4800000000005
right so

5113.44 --> 5127.839999999999
vastly outnumbered by

5116.48 --> 5127.839999999999
dark method methodology

5128.56 --> 5131.92
right and then of course there's just a

5130.639 --> 5135.84
lot of good

5131.92 --> 5138.32
willing people that do their best

5135.84 --> 5139.84
to keep the dark influence out but still

5138.32 --> 5142.96
they're

5139.84 --> 5142.96
they're not mages

5146.0 --> 5152.96
they're still easily influenced

5150.32 --> 5154.5599999999995
negatively as well if because they don't

5152.96 --> 5157.36
have the grip on how

5154.56 --> 5159.1990000000005
to see it as well like dark

5157.36 --> 5163.36
manipulations can get

5159.199 --> 5167.759999999999
really incredible

5163.36 --> 5170.4
like undispellable when you hear it

5167.76 --> 5170.96
and it's fine tuned to your person and

5170.4 --> 5173.36
like you

5170.96 --> 5175.12
there's no way for you to know that it's

5173.36 --> 5178.5599999999995
not real

5175.12 --> 5182.159
right that can happen

5178.56 --> 5184.4800000000005
it's happened to me it's devastating

5182.159 --> 5186.638999999999
it makes me feel very stupid it's like

5184.48 --> 5189.36
oh with all my intelligence i couldn't

5186.639 --> 5189.36
look through it

5194.96 --> 5198.2390000000005
and then afterward even realizing that

5197.12 --> 5200.48
those spells that

5198.239 --> 5202.08
have been cast on me were basically out

5200.48 --> 5205.44
of

5202.08 --> 5206.88
short-term self-defense so most of it

5205.44 --> 5210.239
was even a bluff but

5206.88 --> 5213.92
those stupid short-term defense response

5210.239 --> 5218.239
bluffs have actually

5213.92 --> 5222.84
caused puzzle traps in my mind that have

5218.239 --> 5225.839999999999
lasted for decades okay

5222.84 --> 5225.84
decades

5226.96 --> 5230.56
and it wasn't even like a smart planned

5229.44 --> 5233.04
thing when they did it

5230.56 --> 5234.2390000000005
it's just that it hit the right moment

5233.04 --> 5238.48
is

5234.239 --> 5239.839999999999
punishment of god god using the dark

5238.48 --> 5243.04
ones

5239.84 --> 5246.8
to basically slap to

5243.04 --> 5250.32
to teach the arrogant and i was arrogant

5246.8 --> 5253.52
i i probably in way still am

5250.32 --> 5255.679
i try not to be in it when yeah the

5253.52 --> 5258.719
parts of it that are

5255.679 --> 5260.639
i just tried to be honest right i try to

5258.719 --> 5267.84
compensate some of it with just

5260.639 --> 5267.84
honesty and humility and

5273.84 --> 5295.84
anyway yeah

5277.6 --> 5295.84
going for one half hour already nice

5306.84 --> 5309.84
hmm

5314.48 --> 5318.799999999999
you understand me better than a few

5316.159 --> 5320.48
years ago well dutch sailor

5318.8 --> 5322.2390000000005
i didn't know you were following me for

5320.48 --> 5325.36
that long i appreciate

5322.239 --> 5328.159
it and

5325.36 --> 5329.5199999999995
yes you have to realize that a few years

5328.159 --> 5337.839999999999
ago

5329.52 --> 5337.84
i was much more

5338.639 --> 5343.4400000000005
how did you even say that i had much

5341.84 --> 5349.360000000001
more fear

5343.44 --> 5353.599999999999
and delusion and song of savage baiting

5349.36 --> 5353.599999999999
safania complex i had that

5353.92 --> 5358.2390000000005
so that i would actually kind of like

5358.56 --> 5362.96
put out puzzles

5363.04 --> 5367.76
to distract because in a way i didn't

5366.159 --> 5370.48
want to be understood

5367.76 --> 5371.6
because i was afraid of something inside

5370.48 --> 5373.919999999999
of me

5371.6 --> 5374.639
that i didn't fully understand myself so

5373.92 --> 5377.1990000000005
it was

5374.639 --> 5379.84
like i was more complicated back then i

5377.199 --> 5379.839999999999
really was

5381.52 --> 5385.76
because i had still had a lot of

5383.44 --> 5389.678999999999
unresolved issues back then

5385.76 --> 5392.719
and i worked very hard on

5389.679 --> 5394.96
keeping keeping it up keep doing

5392.719 --> 5397.199
that keep resolving that and find that

5394.96 --> 5401.199
true direct honesty

5397.199 --> 5404.239
and also find just the proper way to

5401.199 --> 5404.239
to compose to

5404.639 --> 5410.2390000000005
to rule to set the rules even for chat

5407.36 --> 5412.4
and communication to focus on that

5410.239 --> 5414.0
right that's what i've done a lot and

5412.4 --> 5418.799999999999
it's worked out great and

5414.0 --> 5418.8
i guess yeah now i'm much more easily

5418.84 --> 5424.0
understood

5421.12 --> 5427.599999999999
so it's not just you it's also me back

5424.0 --> 5427.6
then i was more cryptic

5428.32 --> 5435.12
i thought i wasn't interesting enough i

5430.8 --> 5438.8
thought that

5435.12 --> 5442.08
that yeah i thought i was crazy

5438.8 --> 5446.8
right now the difference was

5442.08 --> 5451.44
i know i'm crazy now it's just that

5446.8 --> 5452.88
crazy is better than normal

5451.44 --> 5454.638999999999
and there's still a lot of good you can

5452.88 --> 5457.28
do with it

5454.639 --> 5457.92
it's really all about accepting it

5457.28 --> 5461.12
instead of

5457.92 --> 5464.8
trying to not be it and adapt

5461.12 --> 5464.8
to a more normal position

5469.12 --> 5473.679
so it's all in the end it's all about

5471.52 --> 5476.639
figure out what you are

5473.679 --> 5478.0
and how you can be productive with what

5476.639 --> 5480.2390000000005
you are

5478.0 --> 5483.44
and keep in mind you have to keep

5480.239 --> 5485.678999999999
growing you have to develop

5483.44 --> 5487.12
because if you stay in the same position

5485.679 --> 5490.56
and you don't develop

5487.12 --> 5494.08
then you will develop in other ways

5490.56 --> 5494.080000000001
that are not going to be good for you

5496.639 --> 5505.84
i know this from experience

5507.679 --> 5509.92
huh

5511.12 --> 5519.84
wow guns have never run that sounds

5512.88 --> 5519.84
really cool

5530.239 --> 5534.799999999999
i don't know maybe one day maybe one day

5532.639 --> 5536.56
irwin will go around the world

5534.8 --> 5540.08
just at this point it doesn't seem like

5536.56 --> 5540.080000000001
it's gonna happen anytime soon

5545.04 --> 5548.88
yeah hello samson by the way good to see

5558.84 --> 5561.84
you

5563.04 --> 5568.8
all right okay running is medicinal you

5565.04 --> 5568.8
might want to take easy on those beers

5570.8 --> 5575.84
it's a little much

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5610.32 --> 5614.0
first relapse of the year

5615.44 --> 5619.28
okay well dude running is medicinal if

5619.04 --> 5622.88
it

5619.28 --> 5627.84
if you really see it as some kind of a

5622.88 --> 5631.84
only 10 dude that's not only

5627.84 --> 5631.84
that's a lot

5633.04 --> 5637.679
have you ever considered finding a

5635.12 --> 5640.4
middle road

5637.679 --> 5642.32
to not completely drink yourself into

5640.4 --> 5645.5199999999995
oblivion every time

5642.32 --> 5647.5199999999995
but actually just halfway it

5645.52 --> 5648.96
like give yourself less than you

5647.52 --> 5651.1990000000005
actually want

5648.96 --> 5651.199
right

5654.08 --> 5660.639
like if you're gonna insist on

5657.36 --> 5665.12
drinking even though it's bad

5660.639 --> 5667.12
and you're addicted to it then

5665.12 --> 5669.04
because it's all about resisting the

5667.12 --> 5672.08
urge right sometimes

5669.04 --> 5675.36
like the state of it yeah it can

5672.08 --> 5677.76
actually have short-term relaxation etc

5675.36 --> 5679.839999999999
so who knows you might have like been so

5677.76 --> 5682.08
tense you just needed that

5679.84 --> 5683.119000000001
but then ensure that when you do that

5682.08 --> 5686.639
you give yourself

5683.119 --> 5688.96
less than you want

5686.639 --> 5688.96
right

5698.84 --> 5706.719
anyway

5701.84 --> 5709.119000000001
right because that way then you still

5706.719 --> 5712.159
kind of give recognition to well the

5709.119 --> 5715.199
cyclical nature of your impulses

5712.159 --> 5718.4
but also

5715.199 --> 5720.5599999999995
you don't relinquish everything

5718.4 --> 5722.5599999999995
right if you completely drink yourself

5720.56 --> 5724.96
full like that

5722.56 --> 5727.1990000000005
then you really you let it all go and

5724.96 --> 5730.4
that becomes the thing that you want

5727.199 --> 5731.839999999999
if you don't do that you only drink

5730.4 --> 5734.96
halfway then you feel

5731.84 --> 5736.159000000001
some then you can actually kind of study

5734.96 --> 5739.04
yourself

5736.159 --> 5741.36
like what it is like and what is calling

5739.04 --> 5744.159
it what is calling for more

5741.36 --> 5745.839999999999
and try to get a grip on it maybe have a

5744.159 --> 5749.839999999999
bit of a good time just

5745.84 --> 5752.400000000001
being a little tipsy and not drunk

5749.84 --> 5753.52
right you might be surprised but you

5752.4 --> 5756.48
have to

5753.52 --> 5757.679
get the initial impulse to dive into

5756.48 --> 5759.759999999999
that position

5757.679 --> 5763.679
where you relinquish everything you have

5759.76 --> 5763.679
to learn to let that part go

5765.28 --> 5768.719
right and that doesn't mean oh never

5767.119 --> 5772.4
drink again

5768.719 --> 5772.4
for some people it might mean that

5774.96 --> 5781.679
if you're going to relapse

5778.56 --> 5784.719
with alcohol then always drink

5781.679 --> 5788.719
less than you really would want

5784.719 --> 5792.0
in order to achieve that throw it all

5788.719 --> 5794.4
down moment make sure that moment

5792.0 --> 5797.52
doesn't come

5794.4 --> 5800.879999999999
just drink a little never enough never

5797.52 --> 5800.88
as much as you would like

5803.36 --> 5807.839999999999
keep the discipline in there even in the

5805.44 --> 5809.5199999999995
relapse

5807.84 --> 5811.6
and then yeah it's not going to be as

5809.52 --> 5814.0
super punishing when you wake out of

5811.6 --> 5816.96
that moment

5814.0 --> 5816.96
this is just a tip

5822.719 --> 5830.159
alright well take care man

5827.36 --> 5830.96
remember it's not the end of the world

5830.159 --> 5835.04
but

5830.96 --> 5837.6
never give up the struggle

5835.04 --> 5838.239
right see it like this you may lose a

5837.6 --> 5840.4800000000005
battle

5838.239 --> 5842.799999999999
doesn't mean you lose the war but it

5840.48 --> 5843.5199999999995
could mean you lose the war if you give

5842.8 --> 5848.400000000001
up

5843.52 --> 5848.400000000001
right so keep that in mind

5852.84 --> 5855.84
anyway

5860.719 --> 5865.76
also make sure you get enough especially

5863.679 --> 5869.4400000000005
if it's like the first time of alcohol

5865.76 --> 5871.280000000001
make sure you get vitamin c

5869.44 --> 5873.28
and you drink plenty of water because

5871.28 --> 5874.639
that part especially if you're not used

5873.28 --> 5876.8
to it anymore it's going to be pretty

5874.639 --> 5878.08
punishing when you drink that much in

5876.8 --> 5880.4800000000005
all of a go

5878.08 --> 5880.48
okay

5881.52 --> 5887.119000000001
get plenty of vitamin c plenty of water

5884.96 --> 5888.2390000000005
especially if you're not used to

5887.119 --> 5889.599999999999
drinking anymore

5888.239 --> 5892.48
otherwise it's going to be really

5889.6 --> 5892.4800000000005
punishing on you

5892.96 --> 5899.52
i i'd almost recommend take the the

5896.0 --> 5903.44
rattler beer half lemon juice because

5899.52 --> 5903.4400000000005
lemon juice has some vitamin c in it

5905.199 --> 5908.799999999999
it's only half alco and there's lemon

5907.119 --> 5910.96
juice in it it's really a good

5908.8 --> 5912.2390000000005
good halfway drink like that that's why

5910.96 --> 5914.639
i like it

5912.239 --> 5914.638999999999
anyway

5917.52 --> 5923.280000000001
yes you are late amanda young i

5920.0 --> 5926.639
officially have already ended the show

5923.28 --> 5930.239
so but i may go

5926.639 --> 5930.2390000000005
like another 10 minutes or so

5937.119 --> 5941.599999999999
all right yeah running is with this take

5938.639 --> 5945.04
care take care man

5941.6 --> 5948.0
i appreciate the the honesty

5945.04 --> 5949.199
that's good at least if you're honest

5948.0 --> 5953.84
with the situation

5949.199 --> 5953.839999999999
then you can also resolve it

5958.48 --> 5962.4
what is my current crypto wallet options

5960.56 --> 5962.96
there i don't really have any i still

5962.4 --> 5967.839999999999
have to

5962.96 --> 5967.84
fix it

5969.76 --> 5976.4800000000005
i i'm gonna call my dad today

5973.76 --> 5977.92
to uh to to get it set up and i'll have

5976.48 --> 5981.119
a btc

5977.92 --> 5983.4400000000005
i have some bitcoin at least

5981.119 --> 5985.44
for starters and then maybe i'll get

5983.44 --> 5988.48
back to the other ethereum and all that

5985.44 --> 5990.08
as well it's kind of funny by the way

5988.48 --> 5991.599999999999
because somebody did donate some

5990.08 --> 5994.4
ethereum to me

5991.6 --> 5996.159000000001
what is it now two months ago and it has

5994.4 --> 5998.48
actually gone up in

5996.159 --> 5999.199
in value like one and a half times or

5998.48 --> 6002.239
something so

5999.199 --> 6004.4
like i got a lot more effectively from

6002.239 --> 6008.4
that ethereum donation than it was worth

6004.4 --> 6010.48
originally if and that's kind of cool

6008.4 --> 6013.599999999999
it's not that it was that much but still

6010.48 --> 6016.08
it was kind of fun to see that

6013.6 --> 6017.04
right but get back to that what happened

6016.08 --> 6019.04
to hair down

6017.04 --> 6021.28
white well the weather changed amanda

6019.04 --> 6025.04
young

6021.28 --> 6025.04
it's not as warm today over here

6029.119 --> 6032.5599999999995
get harmony one

6034.8 --> 6051.84
make a note i'll think about it

6061.199 --> 6067.36
hashtag mifa

6065.04 --> 6067.36
right

6071.28 --> 6073.92
right yep

6076.48 --> 6081.5199999999995
okay that is very little but yeah

6079.199 --> 6085.04
cheapest cost isn't always the best for

6081.52 --> 6085.040000000001
wallets though sir check oh

6085.36 --> 6088.5599999999995
but it all depends on how much you're

6087.28 --> 6092.159
going to be dealing with

6088.56 --> 6096.320000000001
because if you're dealing with huge

6092.159 --> 6098.799999999999
amounts then the cheapest wallet may

6096.32 --> 6100.799999999999
pose a problem because they will start

6098.8 --> 6102.56
delaying or whatever

6100.8 --> 6105.4400000000005
they might not be as efficient or

6102.56 --> 6108.320000000001
effective or get errors or [ __ ]

6105.44 --> 6110.32
right so you got to figure out like how

6108.32 --> 6112.5599999999995
much crypto are you going to be

6110.32 --> 6115.44
dealing with in order to establish what

6112.56 --> 6118.8
kind of a wallet do you need

6115.44 --> 6121.28
but just for basically a purse for just

6118.8 --> 6123.6
a couple of coins being thrown at you

6121.28 --> 6125.599999999999
then probably a very cheap wallet is

6123.6 --> 6127.76
very good to start out with

6125.6 --> 6129.360000000001
super fast okay why is it still super

6127.76 --> 6133.119000000001
fast when you're gonna shove like

6129.36 --> 6135.759999999999
a hundred millions worth of bitcoin

6133.119 --> 6136.32
you gonna exchange that or when you

6135.76 --> 6139.119000000001
wanna

6136.32 --> 6149.84
officially cash that in or something

6139.119 --> 6149.839999999999
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

6244.84 --> 6247.84
uh

6248.08 --> 6254.08
right i don't really talk want to talk

6252.32 --> 6256.159
about crypto too much

6254.08 --> 6257.36
though you know i keep it as a side

6256.159 --> 6261.28
wallet

6257.36 --> 6265.679
i'd much prefer to get paypal donations

6261.28 --> 6265.679
because that helps me very directly

6266.0 --> 6274.32
so yeah again please

6269.28 --> 6277.36
please help me out i'm literally

6274.32 --> 6278.5599999999995
running out of my last few euros and

6277.36 --> 6282.88
that includes to buy

6278.56 --> 6288.2390000000005
food right

6282.88 --> 6292.719
so if you can help out i really need it

6288.239 --> 6294.32
i hope i have been worth it at least

6292.719 --> 6303.84
i think i'm doing pretty good with my

6294.32 --> 6303.84
shows recently

6334.239 --> 6338.718999999999
right and hey you know how much it

6336.56 --> 6341.119000000001
actually boosts my energy even in the

6338.719 --> 6343.52
moment

6341.119 --> 6345.28
do i get paid monthly or weekly over

6343.52 --> 6348.159000000001
there

6345.28 --> 6348.159
well monthly

6350.88 --> 6354.400000000001
but through paypal there's like a delay

6352.96 --> 6359.84
of two days

6354.4 --> 6359.839999999999
at least but not much longer than that

6361.61 --> 6364.688999999999
[Music]

6387.36 --> 6391.04
right and when i'm talking about getting

6389.199 --> 6394.159
paid monthly that's

6391.04 --> 6395.6
getting paid through well my social

6394.159 --> 6398.239
welfare

6395.6 --> 6398.8
and through well google which is basic

6398.239 --> 6402.08
yeah

6398.8 --> 6406.08
that money gets extracted away

6402.08 --> 6410.639
from my social welfare anyway

6406.08 --> 6410.639
so yeah those incomes are monthly

6410.96 --> 6416.639
does most of my income come from youtube

6413.28 --> 6416.639
no no it doesn't

6420.0 --> 6423.52
most of it comes from a social welfare

6422.4 --> 6426.719
and the rest

6423.52 --> 6426.719
paypal donations

6427.119 --> 6430.32
and some patreon of course also that

6429.84 --> 6443.84
does

6430.32 --> 6443.84
also add but yeah

6446.159 --> 6450.239
right i do have a lot of bills you know

6453.52 --> 6457.84
like my rent my storage

6458.32 --> 6462.0
food smokes

6463.76 --> 6468.84
it really adds up things are not cheap

6467.04 --> 6471.84
in the netherlands

6468.84 --> 6471.84
so

6475.36 --> 6479.199
do they deduct paypal from your

6476.88 --> 6483.36
government check no no they don't

6479.199 --> 6486.799999999999
that's why he asks for that specifically

6483.36 --> 6490.639
right because you can take money as

6486.8 --> 6493.4400000000005
a gift like as

6490.639 --> 6495.04
yeah taking a donation on the street and

6493.44 --> 6496.839999999999
you're begging for money or you're being

6495.04 --> 6499.36
a street performer

6496.84 --> 6502.400000000001
right unless

6499.36 --> 6505.5199999999995
like the amounts are very high

6502.4 --> 6507.679
you can actually do that and they don't

6505.52 --> 6510.4800000000005
detract it but if it's like an official

6507.679 --> 6512.56
income like the google income

6510.48 --> 6515.28
then they will you will have to report

6512.56 --> 6518.410000000001
it or you get in trouble

6515.28 --> 6518.41
[Music]

6519.76 --> 6524.84
what does it take for you to live

6521.28 --> 6527.84
comfortably for a month on top of

6524.84 --> 6527.84
welfare

6527.92 --> 6531.119
it's difficult to say

6531.199 --> 6535.678999999999
i'd say at least 100 euros a week

6539.52 --> 6545.4400000000005
that that's actually because

6543.119 --> 6546.5599999999995
if i don't get that it's going to

6545.44 --> 6550.159
eventually cut

6546.56 --> 6555.84
into debts

6550.159 --> 6559.199
bills that are going to grow higher

6555.84 --> 6560.8
so yeah at minimum at minimum it's

6559.199 --> 6563.36
basically 10 bucks a day

6560.8 --> 6565.1990000000005
right i could just say that like i need

6563.36 --> 6571.199
at least 10 bucks a day

6565.199 --> 6571.199
10 bucks a show and then it'll work out

6571.28 --> 6575.199
but it would have to be like every

6573.04 --> 6578.08
single time but no hey sometimes

6575.199 --> 6579.919999999999
people here my donators give me

6578.08 --> 6582.4
substantial amounts

6579.92 --> 6583.4400000000005
like maybe even 50 euros or something

6582.4 --> 6586.32
right and then

6583.44 --> 6588.239
they get kind of overwhelmed like whoa

6586.32 --> 6590.96
that helps so much

6588.239 --> 6593.28
to get less but yeah it's been really

6590.96 --> 6593.28
dry

6594.96 --> 6599.44
i think that i don't know maybe you guys

6597.84 --> 6601.1990000000005
don't feel

6599.44 --> 6602.5599999999995
i should get it or whatever your

6601.199 --> 6605.5199999999995
impulses don't want me

6602.56 --> 6605.84
want you to give it or maybe you are

6605.52 --> 6607.92
just

6605.84 --> 6610.08
like in a financial tight spot currently

6607.92 --> 6611.679
or you all are so you just can't really

6610.08 --> 6613.44
afford it and then i get it but it

6611.679 --> 6615.599
doesn't mean it's less frustrating for

6613.44 --> 6618.799999999999
me

6615.599 --> 6621.1990000000005
right but i don't want to really

6618.8 --> 6623.76
complain about all that too much it's

6621.199 --> 6626.4
just the consequence of living like this

6623.76 --> 6629.119000000001
i knew what i was getting into right

6626.4 --> 6631.44
being a street performer

6629.119 --> 6632.719
a street performer have dry periods

6631.44 --> 6635.199
where they literally get

6632.719 --> 6636.96
nothing for their efforts and that's

6635.199 --> 6653.839999999999
just how it works

6636.96 --> 6653.84
and i have to live with that

6668.639 --> 6672.96
right so

6673.36 --> 6681.839999999999
yeah i'm gonna round out the show

6684.639 --> 6695.84
