[Music]

241.7 --> 247.92
hello yeah man my wires are screwing

245.879 --> 250.67999999999998
with me today

247.92 --> 252.89999999999998
uh yeah

250.68 --> 255.18
it looks nice

252.9 --> 258.6
it's a little better than yesterday at

255.18 --> 261.32
least but yeah I mean

258.6 --> 265.94
it's no Springtime just yet

261.32 --> 265.94
hey Mike it's a dunic good to see you

266.82 --> 270.0
right

268.56 --> 272.34
so

270.0 --> 275.34
yeah it seems like Professor Phil bill

272.34 --> 278.34
is not coming back

275.34 --> 280.44
because kept doubling down and doubling

278.34 --> 282.23999999999995
down and doubling down

280.44 --> 285.08
and I don't think he's ever going to

282.24 --> 287.1
stop so he can [ __ ] off

285.08 --> 291.44
[Music]

287.1 --> 291.44
done with it I'm not having it anymore

293.94 --> 298.62
any man or woman

296.94 --> 302.04
that cannot

298.62 --> 304.639
recognize their mistake is not welcome

302.04 --> 304.639
here anymore

305.73 --> 309.019
[Music]

312.62 --> 317.4
I'm not talking about the mistake of

315.66 --> 319.86
believing in the glove now I'm talking

317.4 --> 321.96
about actual technical mistakes within

319.86 --> 323.82
that premise I'm done with it I'm done

321.96 --> 324.9
with [ __ ] globers that get everything

323.82 --> 327.919
wrong

324.9 --> 327.919
I'm done with it

328.86 --> 334.56
and it seems to be not the only one

331.56 --> 338.16
who's incessantly holding on like a

334.56 --> 340.56
maniac onto this idiotic notion that you

338.16 --> 343.199
can use the radiometric dating on things

340.56 --> 347.34
that are a billion years old assumed to

343.199 --> 349.38
be it's so ridiculous

347.34 --> 350.58
and

349.38 --> 353.52
just

350.58 --> 355.62
yeah that's just what it is

353.52 --> 357.85999999999996
I mean I even still got comments about

355.62 --> 357.86
it

358.199 --> 364.82
just inserting the same [ __ ] yeah I've

361.32 --> 364.82
even like Google around

367.199 --> 372.0
yeah yeah

368.639 --> 374.34000000000003
so where is exactly these reliable

372.0 --> 377.58
readings about radiometric dating

374.34 --> 380.34
outside of carbon 14.

377.58 --> 382.74
right which is said oh so 50 000 years

380.34 --> 385.13899999999995
old sort of it's like the maximum

382.74 --> 388.44
accuracy which is a bit of an

385.139 --> 390.72
overestimation in my estimate

388.44 --> 395.52
but that's what they feel comfortable

390.72 --> 398.40000000000003
with yeah it's super cute so yeah yeah a

395.52 --> 401.639
billion is 20

398.4 --> 403.979
000 times that you understand do you

401.639 --> 406.94
understand what 20

403.979 --> 406.94
000 times

407.28 --> 413.63899999999995
50 000 yes yeah you have no idea none of

411.66 --> 416.40000000000003
you do

413.639 --> 417.78000000000003
it's ridiculous and there is no method

416.4 --> 420.35999999999996
to do that

417.78 --> 422.71999999999997
there is none it's completely made up

420.36 --> 426.18
into this

422.72 --> 428.94000000000005
weird hopeful dreamish speculation

426.18 --> 430.86
that's never been confirmed nobody ever

428.94 --> 434.21999999999997
touched that

430.86 --> 437.639
because it's ridiculous and people that

434.22 --> 440.47900000000004
hold on to that are [ __ ] and

437.639 --> 440.479
delusional

442.03 --> 446.42999999999995
[Music]

448.199 --> 453.479
I should definitely not be teaching at a

451.44 --> 456.3
school

453.479 --> 458.639
if you're going to hold on to that as

456.3 --> 461.16
being real

458.639 --> 462.96000000000004
yeah if you have your ideas I mean if

461.16 --> 466.62
you would have said or anybody of you

462.96 --> 468.78
would have said like yeah but maybe we

466.62 --> 471.24
will figure out how to like get the

468.78 --> 474.29999999999995
radiometric dating better and then maybe

471.24 --> 476.46000000000004
someday we'll be able to right now if

474.3 --> 480.18
you would have said that

476.46 --> 482.75899999999996
it's still kind of ridiculous but at

480.18 --> 487.139
least it would be honest about that it

482.759 --> 489.24
isn't actually possible right now but

487.139 --> 491.52
theoretically they could think of a way

489.24 --> 494.46000000000004
that it might become possible someday

491.52 --> 499.039
yeah well fair enough then

494.46 --> 499.039
but he didn't do that he didn't

502.07 --> 507.08
[Music]

504.539 --> 507.08
anyway

508.86 --> 512.539
right so I'm not having him back I don't

511.08 --> 516.24
want him back

512.539 --> 518.039
also it seems like

516.24 --> 521.0
the spirits

518.039 --> 521.0
are in the air

521.339 --> 525.6400000000001
I wasn't the only one yesterday getting

523.86 --> 527.519
a bit excited

525.64 --> 534.62
[Music]

527.519 --> 534.62
ah Nathan did a marathon Marathon review

534.66 --> 542.2199999999999
of yeah one of these streams done by

538.62 --> 543.72
Dave wise Whitsett gets it Jaron and

542.22 --> 545.1
some other guy that I don't know don't

543.72 --> 548.519
care about

545.1 --> 550.8000000000001
and he was fuming

548.519 --> 552.6
I mean I haven't seen it Nathan this

550.8 --> 556.74
angry in a long time

552.6 --> 558.36
but it definitely seemed Justified

556.74 --> 560.58
foreign

558.36 --> 563.0600000000001
so yeah that was like a record-long

560.58 --> 566.2800000000001
after show again

563.06 --> 566.28
[Music]

568.08 --> 572.4590000000001
so I guess that yesterday was just in

570.42 --> 574.3199999999999
the air but it's still in the air I've

572.459 --> 576.4399999999999
just noticed that it's this time of the

574.32 --> 576.44
year

578.22 --> 585.48
they say the veil is Getting Thinner

582.0 --> 588.54
between the spirit world

585.48 --> 591.24
and the human consciousness and that is

588.54 --> 594.5
the time where basically people get

591.24 --> 594.5
possessed by spirits

596.16 --> 603.12
like by wild ideas or impulses

600.839 --> 605.22
especially inconvenient ones and I'm

603.12 --> 608.339
noticing it I'm noticing it looking

605.22 --> 612.4200000000001
around in people's eyes even as I

608.339 --> 614.94
like on my bike getting groceries going

612.42 --> 617.8199999999999
through the street well I'm constantly

614.94 --> 619.98
looking around

617.82 --> 622.38
looking at people looking at their eyes

619.98 --> 625.04
seeing what's going on and I'm just

622.38 --> 625.04
noticing it

626.64 --> 629.42
foreign

631.01 --> 636.36
[Music]

632.48 --> 638.3000000000001
are now dealing with a higher level of

636.36 --> 641.519
Seduction because

638.3 --> 644.04
metaphorically speaking they have gone

641.519 --> 646.26
and they have gotten their share of

644.04 --> 648.959
spirits from the other side in this

646.26 --> 651.14
period it's like that just happens to

648.959 --> 651.14
people

652.86 --> 656.66
and then they have to work through that

656.76 --> 660.86
and then eventually it'll go away again

662.94 --> 667.3800000000001
anyway I'm just noticing it

665.16 --> 670.38
[Music]

667.38 --> 672.0
okay I got a intact Illuminati Castle

670.38 --> 673.38
here

672.0 --> 675.36
really

673.38 --> 677.6
hungry right now so I'm gonna take a

675.36 --> 690.7
bite of that

677.6 --> 690.7
[Music]

694.68 --> 697.3389999999999
thank you

698.15 --> 703.5
[Music]

705.839 --> 712.82
I'm looking at this title here

709.44 --> 712.82
I came up with that

714.06 --> 718.649
somewhere last evening

715.45 --> 718.649
[Music]

719.399 --> 723.68
but I can't exactly remember what

724.92 --> 730.74
the direct detail of it even was so it's

728.1 --> 732.6
like yeah of course overcoming Panic

730.74 --> 735.0790000000001
that you do that through your

732.6 --> 735.0790000000001
consciousness

735.3 --> 738.62
I guess that's just it

742.44 --> 747.3000000000001
but I think I had like a whole set of

744.959 --> 750.1199999999999
examples in my mind and it's currently

747.3 --> 752.779
eluding me we'll see you I might change

750.12 --> 752.779
the title

754.14 --> 757.92
but for now this is it

756.48 --> 760.4590000000001
how to overcome Panic through

757.92 --> 760.459
consciousness

761.339 --> 763.8800000000001
anyway

764.399 --> 769.279
I had a pretty good night didn't go to

766.56 --> 769.279
bed too late

771.24 --> 777.839
oh yeah yesterday I kind of uh

774.959 --> 781.9799999999999
ended the show early because I basically

777.839 --> 785.339
got overwhelmed by sickness

781.98 --> 787.6800000000001
I didn't throw up or anything but like I

785.339 --> 789.3000000000001
like it felt really bad and I actually

787.68 --> 791.399
just

789.3 --> 793.639
after I rounded out the show I I pretty

791.399 --> 797.36
much immediately Dove under the shower

793.639 --> 797.36
to warm me up

798.18 --> 803.8199999999999
and to like suit

801.38 --> 805.68
situation everything was fine after that

803.82 --> 807.72
I basically took a

805.68 --> 811.079
power nap

807.72 --> 814.639
for like half an hour and then

811.079 --> 814.6389999999999
got on the Flat Earth debates

820.68 --> 825.0
and that yeah that definitely did help I

823.019 --> 829.079
mean

825.0 --> 831.959
today I do not have such an issue so

829.079 --> 835.2199999999999
oh sunlight sweet

831.959 --> 835.2199999999999
more than that

860.459 --> 863.459
anyway

866.16 --> 873.289
how are you guys doing

867.67 --> 873.289
[Music]

873.66 --> 878.76
any kind of feedback or reports on

876.54 --> 881.66
feedback from yesterday's show

878.76 --> 881.66
would be great

884.339 --> 889.8000000000001
I did actually uh make a mention of the

887.519 --> 892.16
situation yesterday

889.8 --> 894.7199999999999
with Phil Bell and this

892.16 --> 898.04
ridiculous assertion about radiometric

894.72 --> 900.8000000000001
dating on the after show

898.04 --> 903.779
and well

900.8 --> 908.76
as expected but still happy that it

903.779 --> 911.639
happened both kiwi and uh an adamicin

908.76 --> 914.16
agreed with me so that was like huh

911.639 --> 917.339
I I kind of knew I was right but it's

914.16 --> 920.3389999999999
really nice to actually hear

917.339 --> 921.5400000000001
people of well their stature confirming

920.339 --> 924.139
it

921.54 --> 924.139
so

925.92 --> 930.5999999999999
only got to hear a bit of the show

929.1 --> 932.88
yesterday

930.6 --> 935.899
my show

932.88 --> 935.899
five roads

939.6 --> 945.44
a lot of it was really just me being

942.06 --> 945.4399999999999
very pissed off

947.22 --> 952.6800000000001
I mean I was pissed off enough that even

950.399 --> 954.899
my roommate just

952.68 --> 957.1389999999999
knocked on the door and asked me to stop

954.899 --> 957.139
it

959.06 --> 962.7199999999999
which is reasonable

965.88 --> 970.9399999999999
a Thor Casey see you

974.7 --> 977.859
[Music]

983.44 --> 987.69
[Music]

994.019 --> 997.88
foreign

995.04 --> 997.88
so yeah

1013.579 --> 1021.0999999999999
what about John 925 your sentence seems

1018.5 --> 1021.1
to be uh

1021.139 --> 1024.6390000000001
a little male formed there

1026.179 --> 1029.0790000000002
foreign

1051.2 --> 1054.16
hello hello

1055.4 --> 1059.5590000000002

foreign

1074.6 --> 1085.3999999999999
[Music]

1082.7 --> 1088.94
how does it look like comment section on

1085.4 --> 1090.5
their live stream of simandan well

1088.94 --> 1093.0800000000002
it's

1090.5 --> 1095.0
the same type of people that just make

1093.08 --> 1097.28
very shitty

1095.0 --> 1099.5
baller troll comments that are always

1097.28 --> 1101.24
whining and nagging

1099.5 --> 1102.86
that's the kind of people that hang

1101.24 --> 1105.44
around there

1102.86 --> 1108.5
this chat is filled with that exactly

1105.44 --> 1110.66
like as soon as you're a flat earther a

1108.5 --> 1115.84
known one you get in there they all

1110.66 --> 1115.8400000000001
start to immediately [ __ ] on you

1117.1 --> 1122.8999999999999
like a lot of them

1120.26 --> 1125.36
so yeah it's it's a giant Hearth of

1122.9 --> 1128.1200000000001
anti-flat Earth or scum and just

1125.36 --> 1129.799
[ __ ] morons who can't move on with

1128.12 --> 1131.9599999999998
their lives

1129.799 --> 1134.99
that's what it filled with

1131.96 --> 1143.24
those chats

1134.99 --> 1147.02
[Music]

1143.24 --> 1149.36
their Croatian in Germany okay John 925

1147.02 --> 1151.29

1151.29 --> 1154.72
[Music]

1152.6 --> 1154.7199999999998
thank you

1155.96 --> 1160.7
please try to

1158.66 --> 1164.0800000000002
make a little effort though for your

1160.7 --> 1164.0800000000002
English that would be great

1167.32 --> 1173.48
I mean it doesn't have to be like

1171.26 --> 1175.1

1487.28 --> 1493.46
that movie

1489.62 --> 1495.32
but yes it was entertaining stupid and

1493.46 --> 1499.52
entertaining

1495.32 --> 1501.559
because it was like computer oh we're

that's the movie hackers

1647.12 --> 1653.059
wow oh that's pretty cool he even like

1650.059 --> 1655.46
shows the 3D

1653.059 --> 1657.02
design details of that that is a pretty

1655.46 --> 1658.88
interesting video thank you for that

1657.02 --> 1661.1
Tony Whitcomb

1658.88 --> 1663.7600000000002
I mean just for the rocketry alone

1661.1 --> 1667.1589999999999
that's pretty cool

1663.76 --> 1671.299
and then of course he seems to use a

1667.159 --> 1675.159
fisheye lens at 200 000 feet

1671.299 --> 1675.1589999999999
which is kind of [ __ ] lame

1675.26 --> 1679.9
I mean it really is why do that

1689.299 --> 1693.559
yeah okay so the guy is definitely not a

1692.299 --> 1696.8799999999999

1792.799 --> 1797.72
why do they use them five routes because

1795.919 --> 1802.179
they're cheap and they're reliable

1797.72 --> 1805.46
they're very sturdy and cheap cameras

1802.179 --> 1808.52
that's why why are they sturdy and cheap

1805.46 --> 1810.32
because they were prioritized in

1808.52 --> 1812.0
manufacturing

1810.32 --> 1814.6399999999999
because

1812.0 --> 1816.679
freaking Globe what else it's still

1814.64 --> 1820.039
always the same [ __ ]

1816.679 --> 1823.779
yeah I mean the thing

1820.039 --> 1823.779
that is less accurate

1847.52 --> 1852.32
you don't film at an angle

on the ground

1860.179 --> 1864.5590000000002
yeah when you're aiming straight at the

1864.559 --> 1869.059
yeah it's really cool problem is though

1867.32 --> 1870.4399999999998
is that if it's going to float around or

1869.059 --> 1872.059
you're going to put it at an angle yeah

1870.44 --> 1874.24
that's gonna warp the [ __ ] out of the

to

clumsily pretend like he's into it

that's what he [ __ ] does every single

stumbled upon something somebody else

let's say

2663.04 --> 2668.98
so yeah maybe there is a darpanet which

2666.46 --> 2671.5
is like a it's very much like free net

2851.079 --> 2855.76
played this internet game

2853.66 --> 2857.7999999999997
like one of the first games that was a

like a a click every hour

permanently like every day forever I

2863.56 --> 2867.46
think it's still going

2867.46 --> 2872.44
that did that

2869.02 --> 2875.92
so it's like a text time interval based

2996.099 --> 3001.619
first project where there was actually a

how

3003.119 --> 3008.339
would guide the mesh of the public

3015.359 --> 3019.68

tax all of it off

yeah

3633.0 --> 3639.96
let the only rules that involve

3636.48 --> 3642.96
it be that you don't

3639.96 --> 3646.92
bother your neighbors like that right

3642.96 --> 3648.66
that if there's smell issues that that's

3646.92 --> 3651.059
accounted for

3651.059 --> 3656.2200000000003
to like at a farm that yeah they have

3653.7 --> 3657.8999999999996
poo smell and that has to also be

accounted for it has to basically be

right well that should be the same

it means that the police

3734.819 --> 3742.14
or whoever the companies is gonna now be

American free capitalism free market

4173.12 --> 4176.299
that's right

4174.62 --> 4181.339
so

4176.299 --> 4183.739
that doesn't mean that I'm pro-socialism

4181.339 --> 4187.5199999999995
it just means that I think it's more

4183.739 --> 4190.639999999999
viable than this supposed free market

4187.52 --> 4193.219
capitalism of the United States which by

4190.64 --> 4195.8
the way most people that even know

4193.219 --> 4197.96
anything about any of this know that

4195.8 --> 4200.679
America hasn't had that for like 70

years anyway

4201.8 --> 4204.04
foreign

4206.66 --> 4214.5199999999995
so yeah it was more an insult towards

4210.82 --> 4217.94
supposed free market capitalism then it

4214.52 --> 4220.360000000001
was like oh I am so pro-socialism now

4217.94 --> 4220.36
I'm not

4220.52 --> 4224.96
but at least it has a certain type of

4223.34 --> 4227.54
function

4224.96 --> 4231.679
and everybody sticks to that

4227.54 --> 4235.699

real morality not just save face type

4235.699 --> 4242.54

actual morality from nature

the totalitarianism and oppression is a

result of its complete corruption

4318.679 --> 4324.4
that was always the issue

4321.86 --> 4328.46
it's a process starts out great

informed

corrupt suddenly the finances like the

the stability doesn't work as well and

4342.14 --> 4346.76
then it just starts to degrade people

4344.36 --> 4349.46
get less moral

4346.76 --> 4352.34
they become slightly demotivated less

4349.46 --> 4355.52
trusting in their government or whatever

4352.34 --> 4357.92
and then it might become tyrannical to

4355.52 --> 4360.860000000001
try to maintain control well then it's

4357.92 --> 4362.38
not really socialism anymore it's just a

4360.86 --> 4366.639999999999

yeah dark Casey but that's actually a

4392.78 --> 4398.259999999999
good point because it is

4395.54 --> 4398.26
in a way

4400.34 --> 4405.14
I mean with socialism officially it is

4403.1 --> 4407.719
about the people with Communism it's

4405.14 --> 4410.84
about the state yeah the people don't

4407.719 --> 4413.08
matter anymore you just have to fall in

4410.84 --> 4413.08
line

4414.32 --> 4420.739
so it's a power shift from the people to

4417.86 --> 4423.739
the state and that's communism that's or

4420.739 --> 4426.139999999999
well yeah that's modern communism

4423.739 --> 4429.0199999999995
in a bigger sense

4426.14 --> 4432.5
but yeah the style can be like Community

4429.02 --> 4435.040000000001
communism like tribe communism that

4432.5 --> 4435.04
works great

4435.14 --> 4442.46
but yeah when you go to government forum

4440.0 --> 4443.84
then communism usually turns into that

4442.46 --> 4446.84
[ __ ]

4443.84 --> 4446.84
foreign

4455.739 --> 4461.239

4458.42 --> 4463.219
it's only about power everything is

4461.239 --> 4465.98
about power it's about that final form

4463.219 --> 4468.86
it's about dominating it's about oh we

4465.98 --> 4471.259999999999
can just kill a million people like

4468.86 --> 4473.78
shoot them in the face like from our own

4471.26 --> 4474.860000000001
cities from our own country we could do

4473.78 --> 4478.219
that

4474.86 --> 4481.339999999999
right because we are so much about power

4478.219 --> 4485.0
that will literally just murder people

4481.34 --> 4490.360000000001
and feel nothing about it yeah because

4485.0 --> 4490.36
it's power it's only Power

4490.94 --> 4496.46
and that's like the

4493.219 --> 4502.54
modern communist system that like China

4496.46 --> 4502.54
has right it's only about power yeah so

4503.0 --> 4508.94
it's basically a form of a dictatorial

mind control system at that point

4802.88 --> 4807.56
completely out of control

4806.42 --> 4810.38
yeah

4807.56 --> 4813.56
I'm talking even about an oligarchy I'm

4810.38 --> 4815.84
talking about everybody that has like a

4813.56 --> 4818.42
lot of money everybody because they are

4815.84 --> 4821.12
corrupted they only get there if they're

4818.42 --> 4824.0
corrupted and they only get more if they

4821.12 --> 4827.96
get even more corrupted

4824.0 --> 4829.699
money has become too corrupting it's not

4827.96 --> 4832.28
viable anymore

4829.699 --> 4835.48
is only become destructive

4832.28 --> 4837.62
so yeah if I'd have to choose between

4835.48 --> 4839.78
old-fashioned socialism and

4837.62 --> 4841.4
old-fashioned capitalism I freaking

4839.78 --> 4843.44
choose socialism

4841.4 --> 4846.639999999999
because that other thing is a disaster

4843.44 --> 4850.699
that's going to lead to horrible

4846.64 --> 4853.719
psychological mutilation and slavery

4850.699 --> 4853.719
very quickly

4858.44 --> 4863.78
and the other one well the other one

4860.54 --> 4867.4
will simply retain the focus on the

4863.78 --> 4867.4
people where it should be

4868.4 --> 4873.62
because in a socialist society

4870.4 --> 4875.0
government actually strives to please

4873.62 --> 4879.8
the people

4875.0 --> 4881.9
to be their servant Above All Else

4879.8 --> 4884.900000000001
yeah

4881.9 --> 4888.5599999999995
does it do that with capitalism

4884.9 --> 4891.98
no no it doesn't

4888.56 --> 4894.8
end up doing exactly the opposite and

4891.98 --> 4897.86
getting a little socialist on the

4894.8 --> 4899.78
corporations yeah that thing that has

4897.86 --> 4903.08
been legalized in the United States

4899.78 --> 4906.679

4903.08 --> 4910.42
proud of how corrupted you are

4906.679 --> 4913.82
yes yeah that's your capitalism there

4910.42 --> 4916.82
congratulations with your socialism for

4913.82 --> 4918.86

4916.82 --> 4921.739
think that's a good system

4918.86 --> 4923.839999999999
I don't think so I think it's a giant

4921.739 --> 4926.5

that's just the money system that got

4963.14 --> 4968.780000000001
corrupted and then [ __ ]

4966.219 --> 4971.78
proceeded out of that

right the wars

4971.78 --> 4977.96
but

4973.04 --> 4980.719
like the real huge problem is the

4977.96 --> 4982.64
corporate socialism

4980.719 --> 4984.26
right and that's more like around

4982.64 --> 4988.780000000001
halfway

4984.26 --> 4988.780000000001
the 20th century when that started

4988.94 --> 4993.259999999999
where it's just like oh yeah we're just

4990.92 --> 4996.8
going to allow these corporations to

4993.26 --> 5000.34
just socially engineer you and [ __ ] in

after I banned you and my chat is

Flowing quite well

5080.32 --> 5086.5
yeah

5082.719 --> 5088.9
so uh I've just noticed that when really

5086.5 --> 5091.6
shitty people start saying shitty things

5088.9 --> 5094.179
that's when other people kind of

5091.6 --> 5097.3
kind of get to the background

5094.179 --> 5098.38
so that's why I just kick out the shitty

5097.3 --> 5101.4400000000005

5098.38 --> 5103.84
so that the real interesting people

5101.44 --> 5105.82

a bad hacker movie isn't it

5468.58 --> 5473.139
it's actually kind of close to the movie

hackers

5473.139 --> 5476.1
isn't it

5489.58 --> 5494.44
requires and takedown Amazon yeah but it

5491.92 --> 5499.0
would have to it like you can't like get

5494.44 --> 5501.28
the virus inside of the Amazon program

5499.0 --> 5504.219
because it's probably too secure for

5501.28 --> 5505.84
that I think and if it wouldn't be it

5504.219 --> 5507.76
probably would become pretty secure

5505.84 --> 5510.400000000001
quickly now it's not what I'm talking

5507.76 --> 5512.62
about what I'm talking about is that you

5510.4 --> 5514.0
basically just sabotage the entire

internet

5514.0 --> 5520.06
from the outside not the Amazon programs

5517.179 --> 5522.82
but the very servers

5520.06 --> 5524.26
to literally self-destruct if they have

5522.82 --> 5526.0
any

5524.26 --> 5531.659000000001
any like

5526.0 --> 5531.659
server duty to any Amazon Corporation

5532.6 --> 5538.719
so yeah I don't know maybe I'm giving

5535.42 --> 5540.9400000000005
handing out terrible ideas for the new

5553.199 --> 5558.28
have considered the scenario

5555.88 --> 5560.1990000000005
okay well if that doesn't work then you

5558.28 --> 5562.599999999999
can always just get a bunch of men

5560.199 --> 5564.5199999999995
together with flame throwers

5562.6 --> 5567.219
and just burn down every single

5564.52 --> 5570.31

5567.219 --> 5575.109
post office whatever they have

5570.31 --> 5575.109
[Music]

5575.5 --> 5578.52
and the person

5589.179 --> 5597.12
need immersive Army for that now you

5591.82 --> 5597.12
just need a lot of local anima for it

5597.34 --> 5601.3
as soon as people realize this is a

5599.44 --> 5602.86
[ __ ] Corporation that's literally

5601.3 --> 5606.34
like

5602.86 --> 5608.86
secretly praying to Satan to kill all

humans right once that really starts to

5608.86 --> 5613.78
sink in it it's not going to be a

5611.739 --> 5617.98
problem

5613.78 --> 5620.259999999999
just everybody will resign

5617.98 --> 5622.12
government will get behind it in a

5620.26 --> 5623.76
populist maneuver and then tell them to

5622.12 --> 5627.84
get the [ __ ] out

5623.76 --> 5627.84
that's probably already enough

5630.699 --> 5635.379999999999
I think that Amazon could probably

5632.8 --> 5638.02
technically go down very quickly where

5635.38 --> 5640.36
suddenly instead of just this booming

5638.02 --> 5642.580000000001
business sort of it just becomes a bunch

5640.36 --> 5646.54
of abandoned warehouses

5642.58 --> 5647.92
with old [ __ ] in it

5646.54 --> 5650.56
and then it's probably going to get

5647.92 --> 5653.159
looted and then it's just in a bad and

5650.56 --> 5653.159000000001
old Warehouse

5655.96 --> 5660.1
I wonder similar company pop up and take

5658.179 --> 5662.56
its way well not if you literally don't

5660.1 --> 5666.58
allow them to

5662.56 --> 5668.88
you say like no no you can't operate

5666.58 --> 5668.88

5697.84 --> 5703.84

I mean socialism got it all covered

5703.84 --> 5710.38

5707.8 --> 5712.900000000001
there are any actual socialism and good

5710.38 --> 5715.78
for their people then they will say hey

5712.9 --> 5718.839999999999
Metro corporations go [ __ ] die

5715.78 --> 5721.12
yeah why don't you go see with our

5721.12 --> 5725.26
hits yeah

5722.56 --> 5728.1990000000005
go [ __ ] over there you're not allowed

5725.26 --> 5732.52
here we're gonna let our people

build what they need from scratch

5732.52 --> 5738.820000000001
yeah that's the real socialism that's

5736.3 --> 5741.52
how you're supposed to do it you say hey

5738.82 --> 5743.86
world [ __ ] Grabbers [ __ ] Mega

5741.52 --> 5746.7390000000005

[ __ ] go [ __ ] yourself our people are

5746.739 --> 5751.599999999999
just gonna do it

5749.199 --> 5754.08
we're gonna allow them to build what

5751.6 --> 5754.08
they need

5754.179 --> 5760.56
and not let you swoop in and [ __ ] it all

5757.659 --> 5760.5599999999995

5761.56 --> 5766.659000000001
yeah it's it used to be called Mom and

5765.04 --> 5769.78
Pop stores

5766.659 --> 5773.679
among others but of course yeah there is

5769.78 --> 5776.0199999999995
a need for internet delivery services

5773.679 --> 5778.54
but yeah those companies should be

5776.02 --> 5782.280000000001
nationalists

5778.54 --> 5782.28
they should be for their Nations

5782.56 --> 5787.5
they should have loyalty to their

5784.96 --> 5787.5
customers

5790.3 --> 5795.88
right and not be

5792.76 --> 5798.159000000001
able to just have that as a face

5795.88 --> 5800.26
representative and then when the [ __ ]

5798.159 --> 5802.839999999999
really hits the fan that they just drop

5800.26 --> 5808.02
the face and just go Mega corporate evil

5802.84 --> 5808.02
again yeah no no no no no

5809.34 --> 5814.719
anyway yeah I'm rounding out the show

5811.84 --> 5817.06
indeed it's been pretty intense

5814.719 --> 5819.28
I don't know why necessarily I have to

5817.06 --> 5823.679
spend like the last 20 minutes

5819.28 --> 5823.679
talking about how to destroy Amazon

5824.5 --> 5828.639
but yeah it's a pretty [ __ ] up company

5826.6 --> 5830.1990000000005
and I would kind of like to see it burn

5828.639 --> 5833.38
down

5830.199 --> 5835.78
within my lifetime that would be great

5833.38 --> 5838.6
before it burns everything else down

5835.78 --> 5842.139
because it is a highly destructive

5838.6 --> 5845.139
company highly destructive

5842.139 --> 5847.0
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

5845.139 --> 5848.32
you like this show I thought it was

5847.0 --> 5850.36
pretty cool
