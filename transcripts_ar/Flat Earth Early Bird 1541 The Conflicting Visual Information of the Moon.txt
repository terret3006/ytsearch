so hoping to get some

96.96 --> 101.579
otherwise I'm again gonna have a hungry

99.6 --> 103.69999999999999
weekend

101.579 --> 107.1
right anyway

103.7 --> 110.24000000000001
is yeah not as beautiful as it was

107.1 --> 110.24
yesterday unfortunately

110.82 --> 114.19999999999999
it's a bit more clouded

120.36 --> 124.979
so yeah the rest it's pretty much the

122.759 --> 126.899
same type of weather it's just

124.979 --> 129.439
clouded and there's not really some

126.899 --> 129.439
coming through

134.22 --> 136.819
all right

143.93 --> 147.09900000000002
[Music]

150.72 --> 157.14
so it's Thursday the 16th of March 2023

157.739 --> 161.54
man this week has flown by

167.06 --> 173.16
all right then let's do a test because

170.16 --> 177.12
yesterday

173.16 --> 179.76
ah it's working again right so yesterday

177.12 --> 182.16
the show got kind of like

179.76 --> 184.76
weird because moderation functions

182.16 --> 184.76
weren't working

186.54 --> 192.12
and yeah they weren't working over at

189.239 --> 194.04
Nathan Oakley his channel either it was

192.12 --> 195.9
really weird

194.04 --> 197.94
just nothing worked couldn't even

195.9 --> 200.94
retract messages

197.94 --> 204.599
but yeah since then it has been restored

200.94 --> 208.739
I've also been able to retroactively

204.599 --> 213.659
moderate like the troll text in the show

208.739 --> 216.0
from yesterday even so it was just stuck

213.659 --> 217.79999999999998
weird

216.0 --> 221.659
but it's gone now so it's back to normal

217.8 --> 221.65900000000002
right whatever that was

221.94 --> 227.159
kind of sorry I kind of let it ruin the

225.06 --> 228.659
last part of my show

227.159 --> 230.22
because the rest of the show was pretty

228.659 --> 233.159
good

230.22 --> 234.62
but I mean I got really agitated over it

233.159 --> 237.54
too bad

234.62 --> 240.14000000000001
anyway hello Richard G first in chat

237.54 --> 240.14
good to see you

244.799 --> 247.58
how are you doing

249.36 --> 254.4
man this

252.0 --> 256.32
the choco font has really been like

254.4 --> 258.799
pretty booming

256.32 --> 258.799
said

259.459 --> 262.699
1390 now

262.919 --> 265.82
pretty incredible

268.08 --> 272.69899999999996
right so yeah that's really working out

270.6 --> 274.68
for him

272.699 --> 276.18
you sounded very good when we talked to

274.68 --> 277.919
it when we talked to him in the after

276.18 --> 280.94
show yesterday

277.919 --> 283.46
the after after show

280.94 --> 287.12
spherical trials

283.46 --> 287.12
okay gritty

290.52 --> 295.44
yeah yeah

291.74 --> 297.84000000000003
Brian's always on the math things like

295.44 --> 301.1
to be fair I can even really properly

297.84 --> 301.09999999999997
watch some of these videos

301.56 --> 309.96
it's two math for me but but I do know

306.18 --> 312.96
that he is pretty good at what he does

309.96 --> 312.96
foreign

318.06 --> 321.38
in that sense anyway

327.18 --> 332.96
right so yeah for letters debates

328.86 --> 332.96000000000004
yesterday was was pretty good

333.3 --> 336.259
uh

342.62 --> 346.58
what else was I do here

354.139 --> 361.759
oh yeah I finished up watching a movie

358.08 --> 361.75899999999996
Netflix really old one

362.28 --> 367.19899999999996
that was like a black and white movie

365.34 --> 370.32
but interesting

367.199 --> 373.17
interesting how it was made

370.32 --> 375.02
uh what's the damn name

373.17 --> 379.1
[Music]

375.02 --> 379.09999999999997
yeah I don't remember the name

381.66 --> 385.91900000000004
and it's gonna take me a while to find

383.58 --> 387.9
it back probably because I have no

385.919 --> 390.12
memory of what's in name I kind of just

387.9 --> 392.34
remember the faces and all that but it

390.12 --> 393.96
was basically about

392.34 --> 397.979
uh

393.96 --> 400.919
Britain around World War II the inventor

397.979 --> 403.25899999999996
of the Spitfire

400.919 --> 407.96
like the the designer the story around

403.259 --> 407.96000000000004
his life and he even like ends up dying

410.58 --> 415.74
I think it's based on historical real

413.58 --> 418.62
things that don't remember it the movie

415.74 --> 420.479
is saying that explicitly but I mean

418.62 --> 424.259
yeah it was very interesting it was like

420.479 --> 428.3
about a designer and their passion and

424.259 --> 428.3
thought it was a very interesting movie

431.88 --> 436.759
old but good

434.039 --> 436.759
uh

439.5 --> 444.979
right what else what else what else what

442.8 --> 444.979
else

460.02 --> 463.15999999999997
was I doing

466.44 --> 471.599
well yeah browsing around a bit for a

469.68 --> 474.599
new game or like

471.599 --> 476.52
just see what's out there like of old

474.599 --> 478.259
games getting revamped the enhanced

476.52 --> 481.02
editions because there's multiple games

478.259 --> 483.56
of that I have been given the treatment

481.02 --> 483.56
like that

486.0 --> 491.06
and I'm exploring like

488.36 --> 494.639
Neverwinter Nights apparently there's

491.06 --> 495.84
peoples are still making modules for

494.639 --> 498.06
that

495.84 --> 500.21999999999997
it's pretty incredible

498.06 --> 503.099
although yeah technically I'm not a

500.22 --> 506.34000000000003
super big fan of the Neverwinter Knights

503.099 --> 509.15999999999997
interface I mean the games were pretty

506.34 --> 512.6999999999999
smooth but

509.16 --> 515.24
I don't like the style of it

512.7 --> 515.24
like

516.779 --> 522.539
it's not as aesthetically pleasing as

519.419 --> 524.8199999999999
just the completely drawn Baldur's Gate

522.539 --> 527.04
series it's very different

524.82 --> 528.72
one thing for that does make up for it

527.04 --> 532.1999999999999
though is that Neverwinter Nights has

528.72 --> 534.0
really good music of a different

532.2 --> 538.76
type of style

534.0 --> 538.76
but classic and very interesting

540.12 --> 545.58
so yeah

541.86 --> 549.0
I'm trying out some of those modules

545.58 --> 552.2
so that's something I've been doing

549.0 --> 552.2
not super riveting

555.959 --> 563.459
two yeah for you guys

558.72 --> 563.4590000000001
just yeah just trying out games uh

563.72 --> 567.98
continued on Benjamin of course

569.7 --> 574.8000000000001
I'm glad that the whole George [ __ ] is

572.58 --> 576.899
kind of dying down now because it was

574.8 --> 578.5799999999999
like getting annoying

576.899 --> 581.64
I mean he still did it very

578.58 --> 583.98
entertainingly but I mean

581.64 --> 586.9399999999999
just I'm kind of sick

583.98 --> 586.94
of Jim Bob

589.2 --> 592.8000000000001
like I don't watch his streams anymore

590.94 --> 594.9200000000001
and like I don't even know what he's up

592.8 --> 594.92
to

597.0 --> 601.44
uh

599.399 --> 604.14
uh yeah but also Owen Benjamin has had

601.44 --> 608.899
just interesting insights on banking

604.14 --> 608.899
situation out there in Fox 2

614.7 --> 620.72
hello craving and blessed trap

629.6 --> 636.9200000000001
right anyway yeah guys I'm pretty much

633.06 --> 636.92
open to talk about whatever

659.579 --> 663.3199999999999
I could just sit here and

663.899 --> 668.779
say nothing

665.76 --> 668.779
that's fine too

669.36 --> 673.74
right but I'm not gonna talk about

671.399 --> 676.079
spherical triangles because there's

673.74 --> 679.2
nothing I can say about it that is sense

676.079 --> 682.04
of that's useful for anything

679.2 --> 682.0400000000001
so

685.1 --> 688.16
azept happy

690.72 --> 693.5
hold on

755.519 --> 761.269
okay

758.19 --> 761.269
[Music]

764.24 --> 769.1
hey LSG good to see you

779.54 --> 783.56
thankful the winters ending

784.139 --> 788.1800000000001
yeah I'm not a big fan of the winter

785.82 --> 788.1800000000001
either

796.019 --> 799.519
I never really have been

799.56 --> 803.9399999999999
even as a kid I just didn't like the

801.42 --> 807.5999999999999
goal I had a lot of like

803.94 --> 809.8800000000001
painful memories of just like

807.6 --> 813.36
my hands and my feet getting too cold

809.88 --> 816.42
and just being really painful

813.36 --> 819.62
when it warms back up and so yeah I'm

816.42 --> 819.62
not a big fan of cold

821.339 --> 826.5
anyway

823.44 --> 829.2
it's been decent enough though I mean

826.5 --> 831.66
yeah it's frozen a bit but it's not like

829.2 --> 835.339
it was

831.66 --> 835.3389999999999
working outside or anything

837.48 --> 841.279
forced to work outside so

846.24 --> 850.04
hello Oz good to see you

853.56 --> 857.7199999999999
what is the temperature anyway let me

855.54 --> 857.7199999999999
check

859.92 --> 864.68
12. it's 12 degrees Celsius all right

869.899 --> 875.279
it says it might also be sunny

873.36 --> 877.8000000000001
all righty then

875.279 --> 882.54
not seeing that but I mean yeah the

877.8 --> 884.579
weather does change around sometimes

882.54 --> 885.899
it's like starts cloudy and then like at

884.579 --> 888.0
the end of the show I'm watching again

885.899 --> 890.779
it's all blue I mean that's happened

888.0 --> 890.779
plenty of times

892.74 --> 895.22
all right

898.139 --> 903.54
foreign

900.199 --> 905.2199999999999
to the forecast it's going to be like

903.54 --> 908.16
around

905.22 --> 910.5
between 12 and 16 degrees Celsius the

908.16 --> 914.6
rest of the week we'll see

910.5 --> 914.6
hey Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

918.19 --> 921.369
[Music]

945.66 --> 949.279
can't dress cold

952.199 --> 954.9799999999999
what do you mean

961.04 --> 968.0
hunt it's been a while since I've seen

964.199 --> 968.0
you in this chat how are you doing

972.779 --> 975.779
foreign

987.72 --> 992.519
Maybe

990.6 --> 994.5
whatever is meaning it doesn't make any

992.519 --> 996.36
sense though saying that because you can

994.5 --> 1000.56
definitely dress warm and you can

996.36 --> 1000.5600000000001
definitely dress cold so

1002.27 --> 1005.3299999999999
[Music]

1007.36 --> 1013.04
if you're hot you can't really do

1009.62 --> 1014.66
anything about okay I'm really sorry

1013.04 --> 1017.959
that you think that because there's

1014.66 --> 1020.959
plenty of things I can do when I'm hot

1017.959 --> 1020.959
laughs

1042.079 --> 1044.98
foreign

1048.5 --> 1052.16
ly

1049.79 --> 1053.84
[Music]

1052.16 --> 1056.059
okay

1053.84 --> 1057.799
yeah well isn't that the entire point I

1056.059 --> 1060.26
mean it's not going to be a hot

1057.799 --> 1063.2
super hot day and night I mean in the

1060.26 --> 1065.86
night it's usually not that hot it's

1063.2 --> 1065.8600000000001
just warm

1067.22 --> 1073.66
but usually nice and warm

1069.679 --> 1077.6200000000001
so whatever man there's no point in

1073.66 --> 1081.2
discussing the minutia about this

1077.62 --> 1083.059
put water on you whatever yeah well it's

1081.2 --> 1085.07
not hot so

1083.059 --> 1088.21
we'll get to that when it's summer again

1085.07 --> 1088.21
[Music]

1088.82 --> 1095.5
sure I'm gonna be sitting here in my

1090.86 --> 1095.5
white shirt or maybe even shirtless

1098.96 --> 1102.26
still

1100.34 --> 1105.28
that's so gross

1102.26 --> 1105.28
why would you do that

1106.82 --> 1109.539
hey Cleary

1127.36 --> 1134.299
okay Oz not super healthy though

1131.72 --> 1136.82
I mean there's plenty of ice cream that

1134.299 --> 1139.6
isn't as

1136.82 --> 1139.6
gross

1151.4 --> 1155.179
but to be fair when I was younger I did

1153.5 --> 1158.419
love Snickers too

1155.179 --> 1163.96
in my teens I ate a lot of those so I

1158.419 --> 1163.96
get it I would not eat them now though

1175.88 --> 1178.66
I mean

1179.66 --> 1184.3400000000001
yeah it's it's just sugar and peanuts

1182.84 --> 1188.4399999999998
really that's really what it comes down

1184.34 --> 1188.4399999999998
to so yeah and a bunch of chocolate

1188.96 --> 1193.24
I get my peanuts from something else

1194.12 --> 1202.6
when I eat french fries I add like a

1199.58 --> 1202.6
satay sauce

1203.66 --> 1208.66
with a bunch of cut onions and

1205.52 --> 1208.66
mayonnaise great

1213.559 --> 1219.82
so I'm getting my peanuts

1216.98 --> 1222.2
I don't long for sneakers

1219.82 --> 1224.12
because it's really about even with

1222.2 --> 1226.46
candies like what in those candy is

1224.12 --> 1228.32
drawing you in and like how can you

1226.46 --> 1232.24
actually get that

1228.32 --> 1232.24
in a way that's less unhealthy

1233.419 --> 1237.7990000000002
right it's like oh are you attracted to

1235.58 --> 1240.22
like salty snacks or are you attracted

1237.799 --> 1240.22
to like

1241.88 --> 1248.96
well p AWS well peanut Things Are

1245.78 --> 1251.78
milk taste chocolate like

1248.96 --> 1253.58
those are all impulses that are driving

1251.78 --> 1256.16
you

1253.58 --> 1257.539
but you're tapping into a bad and easy

1256.16 --> 1261.0800000000002
source

1257.539 --> 1262.76
to get it so if you then basically like

1261.08 --> 1264.9189999999999
oh I have a yearning for this well maybe

1262.76 --> 1267.3799999999999
if I make a special meal that is

1264.919 --> 1270.44
surrounding that ingredient

1267.38 --> 1273.5
then you can have it be saturated and

1270.44 --> 1276.039
then you don't have those impulses

1273.5 --> 1276.039
right

1281.0 --> 1285.52
oh you're hungry hello Aries 106.

1293.299 --> 1299.96
like a tip that I could give it's like

1297.38 --> 1303.2
you like Snickers you have the longer

1299.96 --> 1305.659
for Snickers well make or have your wife

1303.2 --> 1308.299
make garogada

1305.659 --> 1312.14
it's a bunch of vegetables

1308.299 --> 1313.76
including like potatoes with egg like

1312.14 --> 1315.74
baked egg

1313.76 --> 1317.6589999999999
and

1315.74 --> 1321.32
satay sauce

1317.659 --> 1324.8200000000002
great really healthy really like that's

1321.32 --> 1324.82
a good filling meal

1328.52 --> 1333.86
and you'll have satisfied your peanut

1332.48 --> 1337.0
urges

1333.86 --> 1337.0
if you have those

1343.88 --> 1348.14
hey though oh wow there's a lot of

1346.52 --> 1351.1
people in chat today that's nice thank

1348.14 --> 1351.1000000000001
you for all coming by

1351.86 --> 1356.26
like within the first half hour that's

1353.96 --> 1356.26
awesome

1360.26 --> 1364.539
show when

1361.82 --> 1364.539
no

1367.52 --> 1371.2
I'll just tell you

1371.72 --> 1376.58
I'm a tell not show guy

1375.02 --> 1377.96
with a lot of things you should know

1376.58 --> 1379.3999999999999
that

1377.96 --> 1381.5
I'm gonna

1379.4 --> 1384.38
besides like how how would I even do

1381.5 --> 1385.58
that I don't have like a

1384.38 --> 1387.679
mobile

1385.58 --> 1390.02
might have a mobile then yeah I could be

1387.679 --> 1392.96
filming everything make a little Arwin

1390.02 --> 1394.94
documentary of everything

1392.96 --> 1397.88
but I don't

1394.94 --> 1400.7
my camera is my webcam I could

1397.88 --> 1403.1000000000001
theoretically use my P9 or 100 for it

1400.7 --> 1407.2
but that's ridiculous

1403.1 --> 1407.1999999999998
not really suitable for that

1414.38 --> 1419.48
but I have been interesting in some kind

1417.08 --> 1422.299
of like

1419.48 --> 1423.74
device that well wouldn't be a freaking

1422.299 --> 1426.02
mobile phone

1423.74 --> 1429.799
but could

1426.02 --> 1431.36
photograph record and potentially even

1429.799 --> 1435.1399999999999
live stream like have a computer

1431.36 --> 1439.2199999999998
function on it like a portable mini PC

1435.14 --> 1440.96
with Wi-Fi interface like that not a

1439.22 --> 1444.46
mobile phone

1440.96 --> 1444.46
I don't know if those exist

1445.52 --> 1450.3799999999999
but I mean I'd be interested in having

1447.5 --> 1454.1
one just so I could actually well get

1450.38 --> 1458.7990000000002
around and film a bit p900 yeah no but

1454.1 --> 1458.799
no aries 106. it's not

1458.9 --> 1462.52
this is not gonna work out well

1465.38 --> 1471.74
it's an hilarious idea though that

1468.14 --> 1474.679
you could have like cooking with a mic

1471.74 --> 1478.539
and everything and then like have a p900

1474.679 --> 1478.539
film it at a vast distance

1479.26 --> 1483.3799999999999
so that the recording is you would hear

1482.24 --> 1485.36
the voice you would see everything

1483.38 --> 1489.5800000000002
happen but it would be at a vast

1485.36 --> 1489.58
distance filmed with the p900

1490.52 --> 1496.7
would be epic now it would be just weird

1493.28 --> 1499.1
Richard G it would be just weird

1496.7 --> 1502.6000000000001
and you definitely have to do it outside

1499.1 --> 1502.6
then so

1509.84 --> 1515.799
I mean it would be kind of a funny

1511.82 --> 1515.799
gimmick I guess a bit weird

1526.76 --> 1532.72
do you not have yes I do Bill Johnson

1541.94 --> 1549.44
right but yeah such a setup you can't

1545.9 --> 1551.0
really do that alone

1549.44 --> 1552.559
okay

1551.0 --> 1555.08
because

1552.559 --> 1557.0
you need a guy at the camera to check if

1555.08 --> 1560.6589999999999
everything is all right and the guy at

1557.0 --> 1563.659
the cookings yeah I can't do that alone

1560.659 --> 1563.659
whatever

1565.279 --> 1567.46
foreign

1570.679 --> 1576.6200000000001
as a joke it would be fun well look

1573.02 --> 1579.32
Richie it would be a funny gag

1576.62 --> 1581.6
if you'd actually have a cooking show

1579.32 --> 1583.58
and you have like multiple shows of that

1581.6 --> 1585.86
and then one night one time it's like

1583.58 --> 1587.539
yeah now we're gonna actually film the

1585.86 --> 1589.76
cooking show

1587.539 --> 1591.86
through a p900 there's just an episode

1589.76 --> 1594.5
where it's outdoor and somewhere

1591.86 --> 1597.62
somewhere and it's just like yeah

1594.5 --> 1599.179
I'm filming it from miles away it's just

1597.62 --> 1603.02
like yeah because

1599.179 --> 1605.5
why not why not do that one time

1603.02 --> 1605.5
right

1610.7 --> 1614.32
zoom in on your friend

1617.539 --> 1621.74
it would be kind of weird though I mean

1619.4 --> 1625.4
you'd probably be seeing things pretty

1621.74 --> 1628.64
much as is except everything is a bit

1625.4 --> 1630.8600000000001
like miraging or something like slightly

1628.64 --> 1633.14
blurred

1630.86 --> 1635.12
might if it's far enough for you it

1633.14 --> 1637.64
might even start to look wobbly I mean

1635.12 --> 1639.6789999999999
the heat from the cooking is gonna have

1637.64 --> 1641.96
some influence on the air that surrounds

1639.679 --> 1643.46
it it might literally cause a miraging

1641.96 --> 1647.2
in fact if you're gonna film it at a

1643.46 --> 1647.2
distance so who knows

1647.36 --> 1653.1789999999999
the long distance cooking show

1650.2 --> 1656.24
right Thor Casey

1653.179 --> 1658.94
I I don't think it would actually last

1656.24 --> 1661.279
as a real show

1658.94 --> 1663.76
it would really be just a gimmick for a

1661.279 --> 1663.76
cooking show

1671.84 --> 1676.6399999999999
Stakeout right

1674.96 --> 1679.1200000000001
but it's so funny though it's a funny

1676.64 --> 1679.1200000000001
title

1704.779 --> 1711.279
how often do you go out taking photos

1707.9 --> 1711.279
uh never

1712.279 --> 1719.179
when I still had like a decent camera

1715.76 --> 1721.52
function on my old mobile

1719.179 --> 1723.44
that was kind of like just handy and

1721.52 --> 1726.32
straightforward

1723.44 --> 1727.88
yeah back then I did like go around

1726.32 --> 1729.6789999999999
sometimes just take a picture of

1727.88 --> 1732.0200000000002
something because I thought it was

1729.679 --> 1735.2
aesthetically pleasing but

1732.02 --> 1737.779
I mean with my new mobile that's yeah

1735.2 --> 1739.5800000000002
there's literally just no memory on it I

1737.779 --> 1743.24
don't even know how to get it in there I

1739.58 --> 1747.76
don't think it's really worth it

1743.24 --> 1747.76
I don't really go to many places anyway

1748.76 --> 1752.36
in like in the last decade

1751.22 --> 1756.679
did I

1752.36 --> 1761.1789999999999
no no ranty sent it to me he gave it to

1756.679 --> 1764.3600000000001
me through Nathan Oakley in 2019

1761.179 --> 1767.6000000000001
at the Amsterdam conference

1764.36 --> 1769.8799999999999
Nathan has pictures of that and all

1767.6 --> 1771.98
right he gave it away and then he

1769.88 --> 1774.94
started to troll me about it for like

1771.98 --> 1774.94
half a year straight

1775.64 --> 1780.5
it was nice of him yeah it was nice of

1778.22 --> 1782.539
him to do that specifically just so he

1780.5 --> 1784.279
could be a dick towards me yeah it was

1782.539 --> 1787.72
great

1784.279 --> 1787.72
it's just freaking awesome

1794.6 --> 1796.779
thank you

1798.14 --> 1804.5590000000002
it was it was like not too long before

1802.22 --> 1807.3990000000001
he started to like

1804.559 --> 1807.399
sell out

1808.1 --> 1811.779
that was pretty much right after that

1814.58 --> 1821.26
probably didn't I was using it I have

1818.419 --> 1821.26
used it some

1823.1 --> 1827.02
and then I got kind of tired of it

1829.399 --> 1834.4399999999998
it's just like I never really got the

1832.34 --> 1836.899
hang of that thing

1834.44 --> 1838.52
it was just like frustrating and a whole

1836.899 --> 1841.9599999999998
bunch of things that I just can't get it

1838.52 --> 1841.96
to do what I wanted to do and

1850.76 --> 1855.14
and there's battery issues just the

1852.98 --> 1858.1
battery just doesn't last very long and

1855.14 --> 1858.1000000000001
I've tried to like

1858.2 --> 1863.679
get a better battery

1860.38 --> 1866.0590000000002
recharging situation going because well

1863.679 --> 1867.8600000000001
the only way I can charge it now is by

1866.059 --> 1870.08
plugging it into my computer is

1867.86 --> 1872.26
ridiculous

1870.08 --> 1872.26
foreign

1877.6 --> 1881.9189999999999
Ty well yeah though I mean

1887.779 --> 1892.58
it was just it felt like he was just

1890.72 --> 1894.74
like no he's just doing whatever he

1892.58 --> 1899.1399999999999
wants and he's he seemed like a good guy

1894.74 --> 1899.14
but then he just got into shady [ __ ]

1901.399 --> 1908.9189999999999
and after that he was just it was

1904.58 --> 1908.9189999999999
basically revealed to be a total gamma

1909.86 --> 1915.4399999999998
it well that's why I compared the whole

1912.559 --> 1921.279
situation with Jim Bob

1915.44 --> 1921.279
with Randy because it it's very similar

1921.32 --> 1926.539
it's like a sudden attitude change and

1924.26 --> 1930.1
like that's permanent

1926.539 --> 1930.1
and so it's not the same anymore

1936.399 --> 1940.4799999999998
yeah Oz no he is

1942.799 --> 1948.44
he he gave it to me because he was

1944.96 --> 1948.44
getting a p1000.

1950.419 --> 1953.2
foreign

1955.36 --> 1961.8799999999999
but then after I got it he proceeded to

1958.58 --> 1965.299
like send come over himself even and

1961.88 --> 1968.179
send other people over just

1965.299 --> 1971.12
to basically complain how I'm

1968.179 --> 1974.539
not being thankful for getting the p900

1971.12 --> 1978.4399999999998
and like that lasted months was very

1974.539 --> 1982.1589999999999
annoying I almost just decided to just

1978.44 --> 1984.94
smash it just to make it stop it was so

1982.159 --> 1984.94
[ __ ] annoying

1985.039 --> 1992.059
so like that was very obvious he gave it

1988.52 --> 1995.26
to me just so he could troll me

1992.059 --> 1995.26
he didn't give a [ __ ]

1999.32 --> 2005.559
he did you did a fun ride yeah I know

2003.399 --> 2007.9599999999998
and his drone

2005.559 --> 2010.2
that he showed once during an unpacking

2007.96 --> 2010.2
video

2016.059 --> 2021.72
sure that's meant

2019.059 --> 2021.72
oops

2022.0 --> 2030.12
maybe but the thing is though it's not

2026.5 --> 2030.12
the camera's fault you know

2032.62 --> 2037.9599999999998
and it would no matter what I how you

2036.34 --> 2039.1589999999999
look at it it would have always looked

2037.96 --> 2043.679
bad

2039.159 --> 2043.679
right because I got it as a gift

2045.22 --> 2052.7200000000003
and if I then in fact smash it for some

2050.379 --> 2055.419
social Hustle

2052.72 --> 2059.379
it will then permanently make me look

2055.419 --> 2063.96
bad and thankless right

2059.379 --> 2063.96
so I'm glad I didn't do that

2074.5 --> 2078.58
got some nice Moon pics yeah I know no I

2076.96 --> 2080.379
got a great shot with the airplane

2078.58 --> 2082.98
flying through it and all it was

2080.379 --> 2082.98
interesting

2085.0 --> 2091.24
but also back then I still was just

2088.72 --> 2092.98
really on to like what is the Moon

2091.24 --> 2096.22
and

2092.98 --> 2099.339
I had I still had doubts

2096.22 --> 2101.9199999999996
about my own holographic celestials I

2099.339 --> 2106.02
was thrilled still just like not

2101.92 --> 2106.02
entirely sure what the hell was going on

2106.08 --> 2111.52
I mean I had a stance like no it's

2108.7 --> 2113.56
holographic but I I was still like but

2111.52 --> 2117.82
is it no is it

2113.56 --> 2120.16
like am I really sure it is right so it

2117.82 --> 2122.38
was just still like I was still just

2120.16 --> 2124.72
like filming the moon and just being

2122.38 --> 2125.8
like what's going on what am I seeing

2124.72 --> 2128.2
here

2125.8 --> 2131.38
what is my intuition telling me

2128.2 --> 2136.4199999999996
now I'm I'm done with that I mean I know

2131.38 --> 2138.94
what I've seen I know what that is

2136.42 --> 2141.119
like how it happens The Impressions you

2138.94 --> 2141.119
get

2141.64 --> 2148.2999999999997
and a special notion on how the

2146.14 --> 2152.02
celestial lights are just very different

2148.3 --> 2154.96
from all other sort of light

2152.02 --> 2156.16
that it is like another

2154.96 --> 2158.98
it's

2156.16 --> 2161.5
just another dimension of light it's a

2158.98 --> 2164.26
different type of light as man-made

2161.5 --> 2167.8
device light or from fire

2164.26 --> 2171.4
it's different light it has a different

2167.8 --> 2173.88
effect on your site

2171.4 --> 2177.2200000000003
so to me it's like yeah regular light

2173.88 --> 2179.98
three-dimensional Celestial light seems

2177.22 --> 2182.2599999999998
like there's another depth to it that

2179.98 --> 2185.32
you just can't really

2182.26 --> 2186.1600000000003
explain so I'd say fourth dimensional

2185.32 --> 2188.1400000000003
light

2186.16 --> 2190.8999999999996
it's really funny because that notion

2188.14 --> 2192.7
was very early on in the Flat Earth

2190.9 --> 2195.94
talks day that's kind of how I regarded

2192.7 --> 2198.8199999999997
just so like you know it's just

2195.94 --> 2202.839
Celestial light is just coming from

2198.82 --> 2204.579
another dimension Beyond or something

2202.839 --> 2208.119
and now

2204.579 --> 2211.0600000000004
I'm much more like yeah so that results

2208.119 --> 2212.619
in US seeing this holographic effect of

2211.06 --> 2213.64
the celestials

2212.619 --> 2217.44
right

2213.64 --> 2217.44
it's just a conceptual Bridge

2217.599 --> 2221.7400000000002
to say like yeah it's third dimensional

2219.82 --> 2223.42
light things are in a location it's

2221.74 --> 2225.339
radiating light and then there's this

2223.42 --> 2228.06
the holographic celestials which are

2225.339 --> 2228.06
non-local

2228.22 --> 2235.7999999999997
so you could then go into a a flat

2234.04 --> 2238.42
Lander

2235.8 --> 2240.52
comparison and just say like oh yeah

2238.42 --> 2242.079
well three-dimensional light fourth

2240.52 --> 2244.119
dimension light just another depth

2242.079 --> 2247.54
through or something I mean that's the

2244.119 --> 2250.359
only way I could even classify or

2247.54 --> 2252.22
designate this effect of the non-local

2250.359 --> 2254.68
holographic nature

2252.22 --> 2258.3999999999996
like I don't know how else to classify

2254.68 --> 2261.22
it even when I try to describe it

2258.4 --> 2262.2400000000002
besides the description non-local

2261.22 --> 2265.06
hologram

2262.24 --> 2266.7999999999997
well you could do a flatlander

2265.06 --> 2268.72
comparison and just say like no it's

2266.8 --> 2271.8
Fourth dimensional versus the regular

2268.72 --> 2271.7999999999997
three-dimensional light

2272.8 --> 2277.6600000000003
but I mean it is kind of vague

2275.26 --> 2279.88
like that just like the flatlander

2277.66 --> 2281.6189999999997
comparison really is vague it's just

2279.88 --> 2284.26
purely conceptual it's nothing real

2281.619 --> 2285.46
about that but it's a way to kind of

2284.26 --> 2287.5
view

2285.46 --> 2290.82
an understanding of something that has

2287.5 --> 2290.82
another depth to it

2292.96 --> 2295.68
right

2298.74 --> 2307.3799999999997
how does Moonlight go off and on during

2303.4 --> 2307.38
moon phase what are you talking about

2309.4 --> 2314.98
Moonlight doesn't go off and on it's

2311.859 --> 2317.4
just less of the bright

2314.98 --> 2317.4
part

2320.2 --> 2326.68
and it's really about just percentage of

2323.74 --> 2329.3799999999997
virtual surface of the Moon if it's 100

2326.68 --> 2332.7999999999997
then it has the hundred percent light

2329.38 --> 2335.6800000000003
capacity if it's like 50 and it has 50

2332.8 --> 2338.38
light capacity that's there's a pretty

2335.68 --> 2339.8199999999997
linear relationship really

2338.38 --> 2342.1600000000003
I think

2339.82 --> 2343.3590000000004
haven't actually looked up some graphs

2342.16 --> 2345.8199999999997
or something but

2343.359 --> 2348.2799999999997
from my impression

2345.82 --> 2350.38
from what my eyes size up I'd say yeah

2348.28 --> 2353.38
when it's

2350.38 --> 2357.94
at fifty percent lit then there's only

2353.38 --> 2361.6800000000003
50 percent light intensity coming off it

2357.94 --> 2361.68
it lights half as much then

2361.9 --> 2365.98
the lumens

2363.88 --> 2369.04
so it's pretty the the relationship

2365.98 --> 2372.64
seems pretty distinct like yeah if it's

2369.04 --> 2375.2799999999997
full it's you have the 100 Lumen if it's

2372.64 --> 2377.0789999999997
well not there and then you have zero

2375.28 --> 2379.6600000000003
percent and if it's like just the sliver

2377.079 --> 2382.02
then you have just a sliver of light

2379.66 --> 2382.02
foreign

2382.96 --> 2388.54
it seems to be linearly corrected

2386.26 --> 2390.3390000000004
connected

2388.54 --> 2392.82
surface of the Moon and the amount of

2390.339 --> 2392.82
lumens

2414.82 --> 2419.6800000000003
right but a flat a flataholics Anonymous

2417.76 --> 2423.94
if you're going to ask like how does the

2419.68 --> 2426.8199999999997
Moonlight go off and on

2423.94 --> 2429.52
well then you have to have some kind of

2426.82 --> 2433.48
explanation as to how a non-local

2429.52 --> 2437.88
hologram can emit light

2433.48 --> 2437.88
from a non-actual position

2439.599 --> 2444.2200000000003
okay

2440.92 --> 2447.339
now that's a mystery

2444.22 --> 2448.72
so no so if you don't even know

2447.339 --> 2451.839
like the

2448.72 --> 2454.18
the preface of like why how is that even

2451.839 --> 2457.48
possible then how can I tell you like

2454.18 --> 2460.4199999999996
why does it go on and off

2457.48 --> 2462.839
I don't know how that's even possible to

2460.42 --> 2462.839
exist

2463.359 --> 2468.7599999999998
I don't know how you can make a

2465.339 --> 2472.06
non-local hologram so let alone I yeah

2468.76 --> 2474.579
why would I then know

2472.06 --> 2476.38
why the light goes off and on

2474.579 --> 2478.78
with the phases

2476.38 --> 2480.1600000000003
I don't even know how it's possible to

2478.78 --> 2481.9
be there

2480.16 --> 2484.56
apparently

2481.9 --> 2484.56
visually

2503.26 --> 2505.8590000000004
okay

2513.98 --> 2517.039
[Music]

2531.22 --> 2533.8199999999997
foreign

2553.3 --> 2558.28
so yeah there's this

2556.42 --> 2560.56
just a weird

2558.28 --> 2563.5
Paradigm it's like a

2560.56 --> 2566.2599999999998
a mind breaker of the Moon and that is

2563.5 --> 2569.14
like yeah the lumens that come off the

2566.26 --> 2571.2400000000002
moon are dependent on its apparent

2569.14 --> 2574.06
surface

2571.24 --> 2577.5989999999997
like as you were literally reflecting

2574.06 --> 2580.24
light off a mirror and the more you cut

2577.599 --> 2584.38
off of the mirror the less light is

2580.24 --> 2589.24
being reflected so it is like a surface

2584.38 --> 2592.0
except the surface is not positioned in

2589.24 --> 2594.7599999999998
any actual location

2592.0 --> 2597.22
it's really weird it's like yeah the

2594.76 --> 2598.78
Moon is just like a surface just surface

2597.22 --> 2600.7599999999998
reflecting light except it's not

2598.78 --> 2603.099
reflecting light it's just emanating it

2600.76 --> 2605.619
as if it were reflecting

2603.099 --> 2607.54
but it isn't reflecting and oh it

2605.619 --> 2611.26
doesn't have actually have an actual

2607.54 --> 2611.2599999999998
position either like

2611.8 --> 2616.7400000000002
the Moon

2613.9 --> 2616.7400000000002
got freaking weird

2619.54 --> 2625.54
a non-object hologram

2622.48 --> 2627.16
that acts just like it were a reflective

2625.54 --> 2629.88
surface

2627.16 --> 2629.8799999999997
that is

2631.619 --> 2638.319
apparently overshadowed or cut off

2635.38 --> 2640.42
with it in a periodic cycle

2638.319 --> 2644.04
it's like the Moon is freaking weird man

2640.42 --> 2644.04
it really is a weird thing

2644.14 --> 2646.56
okay

2652.31 --> 2655.369
[Music]

2660.57 --> 2663.6890000000003
[Music]

2664.24 --> 2669.24
right I hope you guys are enjoying the

2665.92 --> 2669.2400000000002
[ __ ] the show so far

2672.04 --> 2679.18
a chocolate fund is doing great

2675.76 --> 2681.0400000000004
our win fun however not so great well it

2679.18 --> 2684.2799999999997
has been fine but

2681.04 --> 2688.42
I could actually really appreciate

2684.28 --> 2692.76
could really use some PayPal support

2688.42 --> 2692.76
please don't forget about little Arwen

2728.8 --> 2734.28
hit the like button share the video yeah

2730.72 --> 2734.2799999999997
that too of course

2737.56 --> 2744.359
it's like a sphere being lit yeah but no

2741.46 --> 2744.359
it isn't though

2745.0 --> 2750.28
because what the moon does and how the

2747.88 --> 2753.4
light is there

2750.28 --> 2755.26
it's not scattering as if it is a lit

2753.4 --> 2758.5
sphere don't you realize that the moon

2755.26 --> 2760.78
doesn't look like an actual lit sphere

2758.5 --> 2762.94
at all

2760.78 --> 2766.0600000000004
you can demonstrate this by having a

2762.94 --> 2769.96
light shine on a ball

2766.06 --> 2773.859
that's sort of like the Moon I mean it

2769.96 --> 2776.68
it just doesn't look like that at all

2773.859 --> 2779.92
the only suggestion that it is even

2776.68 --> 2783.04
spherical is because of how this the

2779.92 --> 2785.619
apparent shadow moves over it that's the

2783.04 --> 2788.8
only part that actually suggests that it

2785.619 --> 2793.7400000000002
might be a sphere

2788.8 --> 2793.7400000000002
because how the light is actually

2794.339 --> 2802.48
reflecting off it presumed to be a ball

2798.28 --> 2804.3390000000004
yeah you wouldn't have this even amount

2802.48 --> 2807.76
of light

2804.339 --> 2810.7
that's all equally colored equally

2807.76 --> 2813.46
strong reflected yeah that's

2810.7 --> 2815.2
not a sphere reflecting light that's

2813.46 --> 2817.42
that's the weird

2815.2 --> 2820.74
double mixed messages you're getting it

2817.42 --> 2824.02
from it does the supposed Shadow line

2820.74 --> 2826.359
suggests that it might be a sphere but

2824.02 --> 2828.04
when it's all lit up it doesn't look

2826.359 --> 2832.119
like a sphere at all

2828.04 --> 2835.66
a sphere doesn't reflect light in that

2832.119 --> 2838.359
way a sphere lit up doesn't look like

2835.66 --> 2840.7
the moon when it's full at all because

2838.359 --> 2845.38
the light that's coming off that entire

2840.7 --> 2848.3799999999997
supposed surface is all equal yeah well

2845.38 --> 2853.26
when you take a ball and you hit a light

2848.38 --> 2856.359
on it it doesn't look like that at all

2853.26 --> 2859.44
yeah it's mixed messages

2856.359 --> 2859.44
moon is weird

2862.0 --> 2867.22
yeah the Shadow from the crater I know

2863.98 --> 2870.579
that's part of the the shadow play on it

2867.22 --> 2871.839
but when you look at when it's all lit

2870.579 --> 2875.319
up

2871.839 --> 2877.06
it doesn't reflect light

2875.319 --> 2881.7
like a sphere

2877.06 --> 2881.7
because when you light a sphere

2882.76 --> 2887.98
there's a serve it scatters it

2885.76 --> 2890.3190000000004
the light coming off the side is not

2887.98 --> 2891.52
going to be as upward as the light from

2890.319 --> 2895.72
the front

2891.52 --> 2899.38
yeah there's gonna be a gradient in the

2895.72 --> 2901.359
light that is reflecting offset sphere

2899.38 --> 2903.94
it's not what the Moon looks like when

2901.359 --> 2906.4
it's full at all ever

2903.94 --> 2909.16
yeah and all this Shadow play from the

2906.4 --> 2912.579
supposed craters yeah that is suggestive

2909.16 --> 2916.359
of some kind of 3d-ism a spherical

2912.579 --> 2920.619
nature but when it's fully lit up it

2916.359 --> 2922.7799999999997
doesn't reflect light like a sphere it's

2920.619 --> 2926.079
mixed messaging

2922.78 --> 2928.42
for your brain shadowplay suggests it

2926.079 --> 2931.599
might be sphere light reflection

2928.42 --> 2934.26
suggests it's not a sphere

2931.599 --> 2934.26
yeah

2934.359 --> 2938.2
it's two messages simultaneously

2939.42 --> 2944.76
that are conflicting when you look at

2942.46 --> 2944.76
the Moon

2948.099 --> 2953.5
oh yeah make your excuses yeah good

2951.22 --> 2956.3799999999997
squirt for me Ballers it's really cute

2953.5 --> 2959.2
when you do that I'm totally On Target

2956.38 --> 2961.9
though excellent absolutely right about

2959.2 --> 2966.339
what I'm saying right here

2961.9 --> 2969.4
yeah Shadow play suggests spheracity

2966.339 --> 2971.74
the actual light reflection suggests

2969.4 --> 2975.28
absolutely not sphericity

2971.74 --> 2979.2599999999998
that's just what it is

2975.28 --> 2979.26
when you light a sphere

2979.66 --> 2984.22
shining a light onto a sphere like a

2982.3 --> 2986.02
flashlight or whatever whatever kind of

2984.22 --> 2989.3999999999996
like Candlelight

2986.02 --> 2992.38
it's not going to look

2989.4 --> 2995.6800000000003
uniformly lit up

2992.38 --> 2998.619
there's gonna be a gradient

2995.68 --> 3001.9199999999996
in the light versus Shadow

2998.619 --> 3004.5
because of how it is scattering of the

3001.92 --> 3005.94
sphere that's not what the Moon looks

3004.5 --> 3007.98
like when it's full

3005.94 --> 3011.42
it's not as Fair

3007.98 --> 3016.14
only the shadow play when it's not full

3011.42 --> 3018.78
gives like a suggestion to your 3D

3016.14 --> 3020.8799999999997
sizing of mind that it might be

3018.78 --> 3025.02
spherical

3020.88 --> 3027.1800000000003
but the actual light reflection

3025.02 --> 3030.14
of the Moon

3027.18 --> 3030.14
is not

3030.42 --> 3038.04
conducive of it being a sphere because

3033.839 --> 3041.64
light doesn't reflect off a sphere

3038.04 --> 3044.22
and then look completely uniform at

3041.64 --> 3047.64
every part of the surface

3044.22 --> 3050.339
it doesn't look like that ever

3047.64 --> 3053.4
because the moon isn't a sphere

3050.339 --> 3057.0
it's a non-local hologram that has weird

3053.4 --> 3060.359
Shadow like play on it that

3057.0 --> 3062.339
are very suggestive to the 3D sizing of

3060.359 --> 3063.18
mind that it might be a sphere but the

3062.339 --> 3065.94
light

3063.18 --> 3068.7
actually coming off it is all very

3065.94 --> 3071.339
uniform which is much more like a

3068.7 --> 3074.3999999999996
flat mirror

3071.339 --> 3076.68
or a flat white surface reflecting light

3074.4 --> 3078.9
that is to which it is being exposed

3076.68 --> 3081.2999999999997
like something is obstructing it that

3078.9 --> 3084.2400000000002
part just reflects the light uniformly

3081.3 --> 3086.28
like a flat surface that's much more

3084.24 --> 3089.5789999999997
what it actually looks like when you

3086.28 --> 3090.5400000000004
look purely at the light gradient of the

3089.579 --> 3092.28
Moon

3090.54 --> 3094.319
you see

3092.28 --> 3096.8390000000004
so the shadow play

3094.319 --> 3099.2599999999998
suggests ferocity but the light

3096.839 --> 3102.42
reflection

3099.26 --> 3106.98
suggests flat

3102.42 --> 3109.92
both yeah simultaneously yeah that's why

3106.98 --> 3111.72
people can become a lunatic

3109.92 --> 3116.099
it makes no sense you're literally

3111.72 --> 3119.1189999999997
looking at something that is conflicting

3116.099 --> 3119.119
for your break

3127.92 --> 3131.76
so it looks good now it doesn't look

3129.9 --> 3134.099
exactly like a sphere when you light a

3131.76 --> 3136.5
sphere up there's going to be a gradient

3134.099 --> 3138.059
in the light reflecting of it to the

3136.5 --> 3140.52
Observer

3138.059 --> 3146.1600000000003
the moon doesn't look like a sphere the

3140.52 --> 3148.619
shadow play on the moon makes it

3146.16 --> 3151.02
look like a sphere

3148.619 --> 3153.26
to the mind that tries to size Up 3D

3151.02 --> 3153.2599999999998
things

3153.839 --> 3159.74
the light reflecting of it does not make

3156.839 --> 3159.74
it look like a sphere

3177.96 --> 3182.04
oh you're looking on the object in your

3179.88 --> 3186.1400000000003
garden oh yeah yeah well that object in

3182.04 --> 3186.14
your garden is not the [ __ ] Moon dude

3199.14 --> 3204.839
and there is light scattering like that

3202.44 --> 3208.2000000000003
at a spherical object that happens

3204.839 --> 3212.0589999999997
especially if there is only one

3208.2 --> 3212.0589999999997
light source you know

3212.88 --> 3218.28
it's just less of it going to reach you

3214.92 --> 3220.44
at the sides of the sphere now if of

3218.28 --> 3222.3590000000004
course you are bathing in light from all

3220.44 --> 3224.64
directions which is not supposedly

3222.359 --> 3226.5
happening up there in the heliocentric

3224.64 --> 3228.359
ball there's only one light source it's

3226.5 --> 3230.339
the Sun

3228.359 --> 3233.94
yeah

3230.339 --> 3235.38
if you are outside in the garden and the

3233.94 --> 3237.42
sun is out yeah there's going to be

3235.38 --> 3241.339
light from all directions you're going

3237.42 --> 3241.339
to be blinded by it

3245.28 --> 3249.78
okay

3247.319 --> 3253.02
because there's light scattering from

3249.78 --> 3255.44
all sides because you're being bathed in

3253.02 --> 3255.44
sunlight

3258.359 --> 3264.839
now try that again with one light source

3261.3 --> 3266.94
and a sphere just like in the dark you

3264.839 --> 3268.74
have a sphere you have a light source

3266.94 --> 3271.7400000000002
and then look around and then look at

3268.74 --> 3274.2
how that looks okay not in the outside

3271.74 --> 3276.319
with the sun scattering all over the

3274.2 --> 3276.319
place

3278.099 --> 3280.339
foreign

3292.49 --> 3299.22
[Music]

3295.859 --> 3300.44
yeah yeah keep squirting ballers

3299.22 --> 3304.16
keep

3300.44 --> 3304.16
reifying your nonsense

3304.68 --> 3308.4199999999996
yeah nobody ever went to the Moon

3308.46 --> 3313.16
especially you didn't go to the Moon

3313.319 --> 3316.92
all right

3314.46 --> 3319.38
they tricked you

3316.92 --> 3322.619
moon is not a place you can go it's just

3319.38 --> 3325.02
a light in the sky and I like to figure

3322.619 --> 3327.2400000000002
out its mysterious nature a little bit

3325.02 --> 3328.319
further than it's just a light in the

3327.24 --> 3330.0589999999997
sky

3328.319 --> 3331.5589999999997
I'd like to see like yeah what kind of

3330.059 --> 3333.6600000000003
light I mean it's not a type of light

3331.559 --> 3336.8390000000004
that we can create here

3333.66 --> 3339.24
we can create lights that just like you

3336.839 --> 3342.7999999999997
can't reach that are always Out Of Reach

3339.24 --> 3342.7999999999997
we don't know how to do that

3352.74 --> 3358.5589999999997
why do you think it's light in the sky

3354.839 --> 3362.359
because it is there is a light

3358.559 --> 3362.3590000000004
it light is reaching us

3363.38 --> 3369.02
shadows and everything so it's a light

3366.3 --> 3369.02
in the sky

3370.38 --> 3374.94
yeah it's not a place though it's not

3372.599 --> 3376.92
some place you can go you can't just oh

3374.94 --> 3378.78
wait let's go to the moon and oh look at

3376.92 --> 3380.52
that angular size increase as we're

3378.78 --> 3382.559
approaching oh it's getting so big we're

3380.52 --> 3384.059
so close to the world oh yeah no there's

3382.559 --> 3386.28
no footage of that

3384.059 --> 3389.7000000000003
ever

3386.28 --> 3392.28
and the the sloppy ass CGI attempts from

3389.7 --> 3395.52
NASA to actually do that just look

3392.28 --> 3398.0
really off because guess what the closer

3395.52 --> 3401.819
you get

3398.0 --> 3403.859
supposedly visually

3401.819 --> 3406.2
the more they have to screw around with

3403.859 --> 3408.66
it to actually make it look like a

3406.2 --> 3411.18
physical thing again because when you

3408.66 --> 3413.3999999999996
just take a moon really close up really

3411.18 --> 3416.359
big picture it doesn't look like a

3413.4 --> 3416.359
physical thing at all

3416.94 --> 3424.619
it's very hard to transition a 3D CGI

3420.78 --> 3427.02
situation from the actual visual of what

3424.619 --> 3430.76
the moon looks like from here

3427.02 --> 3430.7599999999998
so that's why they don't really do it

3432.96 --> 3438.42
moon is not really a physical thing

3435.9 --> 3441.02
that you can land on

3438.42 --> 3441.02
you know

3442.88 --> 3447.02
who says they are creators

3449.64 --> 3455.16
that's old Shadow play that's all what

3452.04 --> 3456.7799999999997
suggestion for your mind yeah

3455.16 --> 3458.7
um

3456.78 --> 3461.099
aren't you told that you can't even

3458.7 --> 3463.14
trust your own [ __ ] eyes dude oh now

3461.099 --> 3465.7200000000003
you do

3463.14 --> 3467.339
you do but my eyes told at me it was

3465.72 --> 3469.0789999999997
craters

3467.339 --> 3472.5589999999997
yeah but you can't trust your eyes

3469.079 --> 3475.319
according to your own priesthood

3472.559 --> 3477.48
yeah when you see things at the Horizon

3475.319 --> 3479.339
they're not even there

3477.48 --> 3481.44
they're actually more

3479.339 --> 3484.02
down

3481.44 --> 3485.579
so why would you then assume that if

3484.02 --> 3487.68
your eyes are telling you like but

3485.579 --> 3490.7400000000002
that's a sphere look at the Shadows that

3487.68 --> 3493.5589999999997
it is is fear then oh is it because

3490.74 --> 3496.14
it is a claim within heliocentrism

3493.559 --> 3498.059
within your core belief so now you have

3496.14 --> 3501.66
to trust your eyes do you

3498.059 --> 3504.6600000000003
yeah that convenient right

3501.66 --> 3507.72
trust your eyes when it's a claim that

3504.66 --> 3511.2
concerns your belief

3507.72 --> 3513.1189999999997
but not if that belief is Disturbed then

3511.2 --> 3515.04
you can't trust your eyes no no it's

3513.119 --> 3517.619
where it's supposed to be even if you

3515.04 --> 3520.5
don't see it there yeah it's supposed to

3517.619 --> 3522.059
be in a spherical position so it is in a

3520.5 --> 3523.92
spherical position even if your eyes

3522.059 --> 3526.1400000000003
tell you it's not there this is

3523.92 --> 3529.819
terrestrial refraction or something

3526.14 --> 3529.819
all right don't think about it too much

3534.78 --> 3540.0
that means not trusting eyes well I

3537.66 --> 3543.48
trust my eyes

3540.0 --> 3547.14
and I also trust the analysis that I've

3543.48 --> 3551.46
been rolling out here for [ __ ] 15 to

3547.14 --> 3554.16
20 minutes now multiple times and now

3551.46 --> 3556.619
you roll out like you're completely

3554.16 --> 3558.0
ignorant of everything I [ __ ] said on

3556.619 --> 3559.92
this show

3558.0 --> 3563.76
before this

3559.92 --> 3566.4
I specifically laid out

3563.76 --> 3568.46
how what you see about the Moon is

3566.4 --> 3572.2200000000003
conflicting

3568.46 --> 3573.799
conflicting yeah Shadow play 3D

3572.22 --> 3577.2599999999998
suggestion

3573.799 --> 3579.54
actual light reflection not 3D

3577.26 --> 3583.1400000000003
suggestion but you didn't listen because

3579.54 --> 3586.44
you're [ __ ] deaf and [ __ ]

3583.14 --> 3588.96
yeah you don't listen I say these things

3586.44 --> 3592.14
on the show and then afterwards somebody

3588.96 --> 3594.48
has to blabber out nonsense like they

3592.14 --> 3598.2599999999998
didn't hear a thing and they do it

3594.48 --> 3601.2
immediately after I stop my elaborate

3598.26 --> 3602.2200000000003
explanation that lasts for 15 [ __ ]

3601.2 --> 3607.14
minutes

3602.22 --> 3611.8799999999997
you guys are unbearably [ __ ]

3607.14 --> 3615.44
I just explained this you numpty [ __ ]

3611.88 --> 3615.44
I just did it

3624.53 --> 3627.989
[Music]

3628.94 --> 3636.02
I hate that flat fellow thank you man

3632.7 --> 3636.02
thank you for the nice comment

3636.059 --> 3641.2200000000003
I'm just so annoyed like I just

3638.94 --> 3643.02
explained something meticulously and

3641.22 --> 3645.8999999999996
what happens I'm done

3643.02 --> 3648.839
and then somebody asks about that

3645.9 --> 3651.359
subject like they literally erased

3648.839 --> 3654.119
everything I said from their minds

3651.359 --> 3656.04
I literally just explained it why does

3654.119 --> 3658.7000000000003
somebody ask a question about something

3656.04 --> 3663.18
that somebody else just finished

3658.7 --> 3669.0789999999997
explaining super meticulously why the

3663.18 --> 3669.0789999999997
[ __ ] do people do that it's so agitating

3669.24 --> 3674.7799999999997
listen to what I [ __ ] said idiot

3676.39 --> 3679.5
[Music]

3681.359 --> 3686.72
hey seeking star water

3684.119 --> 3686.7200000000003
see you

3692.28 --> 3697.38
yeah yeah yeah guess what the moderation

3694.68 --> 3699.96
function is back yeah

3697.38 --> 3704.6600000000003
so you're gonna whine and complain

3699.96 --> 3704.66
I'm kicking you the [ __ ] out immediately

3727.5 --> 3733.02
all right

3729.5 --> 3734.76
so yeah conflicting messages from the

3733.02 --> 3736.98
Moon let me explain it another time

3734.76 --> 3739.44
since somebody was [ __ ] enough to

3736.98 --> 3743.099
ask me about it after I explained it

3739.44 --> 3746.28
three times consecutively yeah

3743.099 --> 3748.619
information your eyes yet and your brain

3746.28 --> 3752.6400000000003
get from looking at the moon is

3748.619 --> 3755.579
conflicting it's unnatural yeah to your

3752.64 --> 3759.0
brain unnatural

3755.579 --> 3761.9
what you're seeing is not logical about

3759.0 --> 3765.299
it if you're going to

3761.9 --> 3768.839
insist you're looking at an object and

3765.299 --> 3770.94
not just a random image

3768.839 --> 3773.339
just a visual

3770.94 --> 3776.28
it's very conflicting because there's

3773.339 --> 3780.119
Shadow play with the Moon that suggests

3776.28 --> 3783.119
it might be a 3D ball-like object being

3780.119 --> 3786.839
lit up at a distance but when it's fully

3783.119 --> 3788.7000000000003
lit up it doesn't actually

3786.839 --> 3793.88
scatter light

3788.7 --> 3796.74
like a ball would it seems much more

3793.88 --> 3799.559
even out the light that's coming off it

3796.74 --> 3801.9599999999996
that would directly suggest to the brain

3799.559 --> 3803.3390000000004
which sizes up things with Shadow play

3801.96 --> 3806.94
too right

3803.339 --> 3809.88
not just the stupid crater things

3806.94 --> 3811.7400000000002
yeah the supposed greater things yeah

3809.88 --> 3813.1800000000003
that they are gone then yeah when it's

3811.74 --> 3815.4599999999996
uniformly lit up oh there's no more

3813.18 --> 3817.98
creators yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and

3815.46 --> 3821.579
then it reflects like it's a flat

3817.98 --> 3824.18
surface like a round mirror that's just

3821.579 --> 3827.28
directly reflecting light right at you

3824.18 --> 3829.74
uniformly lit up just as much lit up on

3827.28 --> 3831.96
the sides is on the front

3829.74 --> 3836.8799999999997
which does not match

3831.96 --> 3839.28
a 3D ball like object reflecting light

3836.88 --> 3842.119
from a source

3839.28 --> 3845.88
because a 3D object a ball

3842.119 --> 3848.6400000000003
will have be much brighter at the

3845.88 --> 3850.559
specular point at the front yeah you see

3848.64 --> 3851.64
the maximum light reflection there

3850.559 --> 3854.6400000000003
because

3851.64 --> 3858.0
it's most of it's reflecting right to

3854.64 --> 3860.7
you and on the sides of the sphere a lot

3858.0 --> 3863.7
of it just goes away

3860.7 --> 3867.74
so it will be not as bright

3863.7 --> 3872.04
on the side yeah that's how a sphere

3867.74 --> 3874.2
reflects light from a singular source

3872.04 --> 3876.92
that's how that happens and that's not

3874.2 --> 3880.6189999999997
what the full moon looks like so yeah

3876.92 --> 3882.48
conflicting messages to your eyes when

3880.619 --> 3885.119
you're looking at the moon and your

3882.48 --> 3888.18
brain is trying to size up what you're

3885.119 --> 3890.96
looking at yeah that's the truth that's

3888.18 --> 3890.96
how it works

3897.93 --> 3903.969
[Music]

3904.21 --> 3910.05
[Applause]

3906.99 --> 3910.0499999999997
[Music]

3912.059 --> 3918.8590000000004
yeah I got a good title the conflicting

3914.76 --> 3918.8590000000004
visual information of the Moon

3920.579 --> 3923.3590000000004
excellent

3941.28 --> 3946.2000000000003
for us yeah oh hey hey keep telling

3944.4 --> 3947.76
yourself that this is not a paradox it

3946.2 --> 3951.66
doesn't it doesn't matter if it doesn't

3947.76 --> 3955.98
make sense because we believe

3951.66 --> 3959.3999999999996
yes yes I know you believe

3955.98 --> 3963.66
in your heliocentric hermeneutics

3959.4 --> 3966.42
yeah her menuetix I know

3963.66 --> 3968.22
Celia Center humanoidics so yeah we

3966.42 --> 3970.859
could say oh it's conflicting look

3968.22 --> 3974.8799999999997
here's why explain it why conflicting

3970.859 --> 3976.319
for who not for us yes Fundy [ __ ] with

3974.88 --> 3979.02
[ __ ]

3976.319 --> 3981.24
I know I know conflicting information

3979.02 --> 3983.819
isn't conflicting to you because you

3981.24 --> 3988.02
have no more reason at your foundation

3983.819 --> 3991.5589999999997
you're just a ball [ __ ]

3988.02 --> 3993.96
can't reason anymore yeah when you get

3991.559 --> 3996.1800000000003
fat conflicting information by your

3993.96 --> 3999.18
religion all the time

3996.18 --> 4000.98
without telling you hey maybe you should

3999.18 --> 4003.98
think critically about what you've been

4000.98 --> 4008.48
said and eventually you lose that and

4003.98 --> 4011.26
you're just like no no itchy ball it chy

4008.48 --> 4014.539
ball because your religion makes you

4011.26 --> 4020.5
[ __ ] evil nightmare the ball

4014.539 --> 4026.26
religion actively makes people [ __ ]

4020.5 --> 4026.26
yeah makes you tolerant to double think

4026.48 --> 4029.2
[ __ ]

4034.22 --> 4039.6189999999997
what is this conflicting information the

4037.579 --> 4043.4
light information from the Moon I just

4039.619 --> 4045.819
explained this to you Orinoco Wambo

4043.4 --> 4048.7400000000002
the last 30 minutes have been

4045.819 --> 4051.14
exclusively me explaining what it is

4048.74 --> 4053.839
about that's why I put it in the title

4051.14 --> 4055.819
where you [ __ ] trying to get your

4053.839 --> 4058.819
[ __ ] out of your ears

4055.819 --> 4062.119
oh you just got here oh really did you

4058.819 --> 4064.16
just get here did he did already just

4062.119 --> 4068.7400000000002
get here

4064.16 --> 4068.74
no no you didn't just get here

4069.44 --> 4073.46
you were here at two o'clock so you've

4071.42 --> 4075.7400000000002
been here for 10 minutes I've explained

4073.46 --> 4077.7200000000003
it at least three times in the last 10

4075.74 --> 4079.64
minutes

4077.72 --> 4083.18
yeah you were here

4079.64 --> 4085.94
yeah your first message in my chat

4083.18 --> 4088.16
it's very close to two o'clock

4085.94 --> 4091.78
yeah

4088.16 --> 4095.5389999999998
you did you did not just arrive

4091.78 --> 4098.42
I've explained it in the last 10 minutes

4095.539 --> 4101.2390000000005
at least twice

4098.42 --> 4103.46
yeah the conflicting information in

4101.239 --> 4106.639999999999
visual information about the moon

4103.46 --> 4109.16
is about the shadow play the apparent

4106.64 --> 4111.14
Shadow play that is suggestive of a

4109.16 --> 4113.54
spherical nature

4111.14 --> 4118.04
but when it's full

4113.54 --> 4120.98
the light coming off it is not

4118.04 --> 4124.5199999999995
comp does not comport with light

4120.98 --> 4128.08
reflecting from a sphere yeah

4124.52 --> 4128.080000000001
did you get it this time

4128.6 --> 4134.08
did you get it now

4130.94 --> 4134.08
we're gonna go one more

4138.85 --> 4141.9490000000005
[Music]

4146.299 --> 4151.06
compared to what compared to reality

4154.279 --> 4161.42
when you light up a sphere object with a

4159.02 --> 4163.819
single light source in the dark not

4161.42 --> 4165.38
light scattering from all over the place

4163.819 --> 4168.02
yeah

4165.38 --> 4170.66
in the dark a sphere you light it up

4168.02 --> 4173.96
from a single Source guess what it's not

4170.66 --> 4177.3189999999995
gonna look like the full moon

4173.96 --> 4180.199
because light it's gonna have different

4177.319 --> 4183.02
types of spreading around reflecting

4180.199 --> 4184.46
against that spherical surface yeah well

4183.02 --> 4188.42
the full moon

4184.46 --> 4192.44
the light of it The Edge and at the

4188.42 --> 4196.16
middle is exactly equal which does not

4192.44 --> 4198.98
happen when you shine a light

4196.16 --> 4201.58
on a sphere in the dark

4198.98 --> 4201.58
you get it

4202.34 --> 4206.84
what it looks like is like a flat

4205.34 --> 4210.56
surface

4206.84 --> 4214.64
being uniformly lit up like a mirror

4210.56 --> 4217.820000000001
reflecting light yeah that's what the

4214.64 --> 4220.58
full moon actually looks like despite

4217.82 --> 4223.82
the shadow play

4220.58 --> 4226.64
that may happen when it's not full

4223.82 --> 4228.259999999999
so what happens oh no it's fair when

4226.64 --> 4229.6990000000005
it's not full but when it's full oh now

4228.26 --> 4232.58
it's just flat

4229.699 --> 4236.719
oh yeah yeah oh no no no no no no it

4232.58 --> 4238.82
isn't yeah the visual information of the

4236.719 --> 4240.7390000000005
moon is conflicting

4238.82 --> 4243.679
doesn't make sense the shadow play

4240.739 --> 4248.0599999999995
suggests that it might be spherical

4243.679 --> 4250.76
but the way the let the light reflects

4248.06 --> 4253.76
or comes towards you what you see there

4250.76 --> 4256.52
how it's lit up is uniform

4253.76 --> 4260.0
which does not happen when in the dark

4256.52 --> 4262.34
you light up a sphere with a single

4260.0 --> 4266.179
light source it's not what the full moon

4262.34 --> 4268.159000000001
looks like yeah is am I clear yet I've

4266.179 --> 4270.8
just spent like over half an hour

4268.159 --> 4274.239
explaining this non-stop is it clear yet

4270.8 --> 4274.2390000000005
to you you getting it yet

4276.5 --> 4279.219
foreign

4280.07 --> 4283.179999999999
[Music]

4286.159 --> 4289.659
are you blabbering about

4293.719 --> 4296.56
it's [ __ ]

4297.86 --> 4303.139999999999
what the [ __ ] do you even mean if this

4299.84 --> 4307.78
surface isn't smooth it looks uniform

4303.14 --> 4307.780000000001
the light coming off it is uniform

4312.199 --> 4319.04
that makes no sense

4315.56 --> 4322.6990000000005
yeah at the side of the supposed to be

4319.04 --> 4325.58
sphere it yeah when you have a sphere

4322.699 --> 4328.28
and there's light literally

4325.58 --> 4329.96
yeah coming from relatively you're the

4328.28 --> 4332.0
visual Direction coming here yeah

4329.96 --> 4335.02
reflecting on the side of the sphere

4332.0 --> 4338.06
yeah it's not going to be like a perfect

4335.02 --> 4340.6990000000005
straight on 90 degrees mirror reflecting

4338.06 --> 4342.679
that super bright light right there

4340.699 --> 4345.259999999999
right back and no it doesn't because

4342.679 --> 4347.06
it's at this side

4345.26 --> 4349.6990000000005
you dumbass

4347.06 --> 4353.120000000001
yeah it's at this sign it's not gonna

4349.699 --> 4355.639999999999
like a flat 90 degrees mirror send that

4353.12 --> 4358.64
light at full force right back at you as

4355.64 --> 4362.860000000001
it does at the front of the sphere yeah

4358.64 --> 4366.34
because spheres don't reflect light

4362.86 --> 4368.96
uniformly because their sphericity

4366.34 --> 4371.179
doesn't allow that the light is

4368.96 --> 4372.8
reflected at this side in other

4371.179 --> 4373.82
direction so it's going to be less

4372.8 --> 4377.62
bright

4373.82 --> 4377.62
you get it you dumbass

4381.98 --> 4384.94
[ __ ]

4389.6 --> 4395.120000000001
does it matter what the [ __ ] the sphere

4392.179 --> 4396.56
shape dude you can do that with a sphere

4395.12 --> 4402.58
of cheese

4396.56 --> 4402.580000000001
can be all holes it's still not going to

4403.76 --> 4409.360000000001
it's still

4405.98 --> 4413.239
not going to give you bright light

4409.36 --> 4418.04
Reflections at the edge on the side

4413.239 --> 4419.839999999999
this is basic freaking logic dude basic

4418.04 --> 4423.199
logic

4419.84 --> 4426.1990000000005
doesn't matter what the sphere is on the

4423.199 --> 4429.379999999999
side it's not gonna give you a straight

4426.199 --> 4433.419999999999
on brightness it's not how spheres work

4429.38 --> 4433.42
when you light them you dumbass

4443.26 --> 4448.34
that's right flat fellow thank you

4445.88 --> 4450.62
somebody that freaking gets it and it's

4448.34 --> 4453.02
not just whining and bitching because

4450.62 --> 4455.0599999999995
their ball Leaf has been compromised

4453.02 --> 4457.659000000001
again

4455.06 --> 4457.659000000001
God

4464.12 --> 4469.88
saying that looks uniform yeah

4467.06 --> 4473.0
yeah it does

4469.88 --> 4475.88
absolutely yeah

4473.0 --> 4477.56
why didn't you measure the lumens

4475.88 --> 4480.9400000000005
at the middle

4477.56 --> 4483.7390000000005
of that supposed moon picture

4480.94 --> 4486.199
and then all the way to the side yeah

4483.739 --> 4489.199
why don't you try the bottom

4486.199 --> 4493.759999999999
yeah yeah yeah yes do you do you

4489.199 --> 4495.62
just take a little circle snip it put it

4493.76 --> 4498.1990000000005
in Photoshop and then take a little

4495.62 --> 4499.46
circle snippet of the middle put it as

4498.199 --> 4501.219
far as you put it right next to one

4499.46 --> 4505.04
another guess what

4501.219 --> 4508.699
it's just as bright you dumbass

4505.04 --> 4511.5199999999995
it's just as right huh

4508.699 --> 4512.239
when you light up a sphere the edge of

4511.52 --> 4516.26
it

4512.239 --> 4518.0599999999995
is not a hard cut lit up space it

4516.26 --> 4520.1
doesn't look like that

4518.06 --> 4524.120000000001
okay

4520.1 --> 4527.179
that's not how lit up spheres look

4524.12 --> 4531.14
so thank you for showing a picture of

4527.179 --> 4533.3
the moon so I could prove my point again

4531.14 --> 4536.06
but I guess that you can look at the

4533.3 --> 4538.219
same thing and say no I can see this you

4536.06 --> 4540.1990000000005
just fear it's a spirit even though you

4538.219 --> 4542.02
didn't actually pay attention

4540.199 --> 4544.879999999999
to what I said is that like yeah yeah

4542.02 --> 4546.8
Luminosity yeah the middle

4544.88 --> 4548.719
verses at the side yeah it's the same

4546.8 --> 4550.9400000000005
because it's not a sphere

4548.719 --> 4552.7390000000005
it's not a sphere that's a light is

4550.94 --> 4555.0199999999995
being shown upon

4552.739 --> 4558.98
because they don't look like that yeah

4555.02 --> 4561.38
the light the edge of the sphere is not

4558.98 --> 4563.9
gonna look as bright

4561.38 --> 4566.4400000000005
as at the dead center

4563.9 --> 4566.44
yeah

4575.36 --> 4580.46
this mom used to have made up my mind

4577.82 --> 4583.46
yes keep rejecting for me funny [ __ ]

4580.46 --> 4586.159
keep projecting dumbass

4583.46 --> 4588.14
look spherical

4586.159 --> 4590.299999999999
we went there you went there you never

4588.14 --> 4592.6990000000005
came back did you

4590.3 --> 4594.26
once you think the Moon is a sphere you

4592.699 --> 4597.379999999999
could never go back

4594.26 --> 4600.860000000001
you're stuck on the moon now

4597.38 --> 4603.14
yeah you went to the moon this is a

4600.86 --> 4606.62
sphere it's really a sphere

4603.14 --> 4608.6
look at it it's uniformly lit at the

4606.62 --> 4610.719
edges as in the middle but it's a

4608.6 --> 4613.9400000000005
freaking sphere because

4610.719 --> 4615.5
this particular sphere does work like

4613.94 --> 4617.839999999999
that

4615.5 --> 4620.84
I know I can't actually do that in real

4617.84 --> 4622.76
life physically make a sphere look like

4620.84 --> 4625.219
that when you light it up with one light

4622.76 --> 4627.92
source in the dark you can't make it

4625.219 --> 4629.92
look like that but what the moon is the

4627.92 --> 4632.7390000000005
exception yeah

4629.92 --> 4635.54
American exceptionalism

4632.739 --> 4637.459999999999
exceptionalism yeah you can make an

4635.54 --> 4640.219
exception to logic

4637.46 --> 4643.04
the Moon is a damn sphere of your hair

4640.219 --> 4645.679
doesn't matter if it's not

4643.04 --> 4647.239
actually looking like a sphere if you

4645.679 --> 4648.86
think of it as fear and you just say

4647.239 --> 4651.44
it's a sphere it's a sphere it's a

4648.86 --> 4653.78
sphere then it's gonna be a sphere even

4651.44 --> 4655.5199999999995
if the light Saturn is not like of a

4653.78 --> 4657.199
sphere at all it doesn't matter

4655.52 --> 4661.64
because it's a sphere because you got

4657.199 --> 4664.46
grit yeah you went there to that Moon

4661.64 --> 4665.860000000001
because it's just fair really it is even

4664.46 --> 4670.159
though the light doesn't make any sense

4665.86 --> 4672.62
it's still a sphere right I'm I'm just I

4670.159 --> 4675.139999999999
can't let it go just to flutter the cat

4672.62 --> 4676.699
let go just this logical observation of

4675.14 --> 4678.08
how the lighting doesn't make any sense

4676.699 --> 4680.178999999999
for his fear

4678.08 --> 4682.04
yeah but it does make sense because you

4680.179 --> 4685.82
had an article with a picture of the

4682.04 --> 4688.1
Moon and it told you it made sense damn

4685.82 --> 4691.58
you Arwin

4688.1 --> 4694.04
you can't let it go yeah yeah logic I

4691.58 --> 4696.0199999999995
can't let it go I'm so sorry I can't let

4694.04 --> 4699.82
logic go I know

4696.02 --> 4699.820000000001
if it's a logical it's illogical

4700.46 --> 4705.199
but I know you went there I know you

4702.86 --> 4708.219
went to the moon guys

4705.199 --> 4708.219
you got Grit

4713.3 --> 4716.4400000000005
too serious Escape

4730.58 --> 4734.42
school if their word is great now but it

4732.44 --> 4737.0
is in the sphere

4734.42 --> 4738.92
yeah when you light up a sphere with a

4737.0 --> 4742.159
singular light source in a dark room

4738.92 --> 4744.08
which is the heliocentric claim yeah the

4742.159 --> 4745.82
sun being the only source light light

4744.08 --> 4748.94
source yeah

4745.82 --> 4750.5599999999995
and you'd light up a sphere from by but

4748.94 --> 4753.5
from your back straight as you're

4750.56 --> 4755.780000000001
looking at it yeah yeah is that the side

4753.5 --> 4760.06
it's not going to be as right

4755.78 --> 4760.0599999999995
yeah it doesn't look like that because

4760.1 --> 4765.9800000000005
it's not facing the same direction and

4763.52 --> 4767.4800000000005
the light's gonna scatter off so it's

4765.98 --> 4770.54
going to be less bright at the edges

4767.48 --> 4774.259999999999
yeah yeah except the moon not the moon

4770.54 --> 4777.62
dammit oh

4774.26 --> 4781.2390000000005
no the Moon is the exception

4777.62 --> 4781.239
okay guns enough right no problem

4781.6 --> 4785.1990000000005
don't worry about it

4790.12 --> 4797.5599999999995
what causes eclipses uh what the [ __ ]

4793.88 --> 4797.56
cost is non-local Holograms

4798.08 --> 4802.0
it's like oh yeah I don't know what they

4800.6 --> 4804.1990000000005
are how they're

4802.0 --> 4806.78
apparently they're not even actually

4804.199 --> 4809.178999999999
there and then yeah how does that get

4806.78 --> 4811.699
blocked that thing that's not even

4809.179 --> 4815.06
actually there

4811.699 --> 4817.099999999999
I don't know man I don't know how to

4815.06 --> 4818.780000000001
create non-local Holograms and I

4817.1 --> 4822.34
definitely don't know how to

4818.78 --> 4822.34
periodically block them

4852.679 --> 4857.54
all right so while the balls are having

4854.6 --> 4859.46
a little Moon dance

4857.54 --> 4862.42
squirting in my chat I think I'm gonna

4859.46 --> 4862.42
take a two minute break

4864.679 --> 4869.659
please donate to my PayPal I really need

4867.38 --> 4873.5
it actually

4869.659 --> 4875.12
so yeah please do that

4873.5 --> 4877.04
I just want to get through the weekend

4875.12 --> 4880.84
if you know what I mean

4877.04 --> 4880.84
right anyway be right back

4883.219 --> 4886.219
foreign

4976.0 --> 4979.239
thank you

4982.94 --> 4986.259999999999
and I'm back

4999.92 --> 5005.56
I've never seen a planner scientists oh

5003.699 --> 5007.719
well they probably just think you're a

5005.56 --> 5009.52
ball tart so they keep their ideas to

5007.719 --> 5012.1
themselves

5009.52 --> 5014.4400000000005
biggest dogs yeah

5012.1 --> 5016.659000000001
besides you're not a scientist you don't

5014.44 --> 5019.719
even know what science is

5016.659 --> 5022.32
ball tards never do

5019.719 --> 5022.32
foreign

5041.82 --> 5047.799999999999
yeah so just roll out the ad homs and

5045.28 --> 5049.239
just admit you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

5047.8 --> 5050.7390000000005
you can't win

5049.239 --> 5053.08
because you're wrong

5050.739 --> 5054.5199999999995
and the Earth is flat and on a ball and

5053.08 --> 5057.88
the Moon

5054.52 --> 5060.6990000000005
is not an object it's not a sphere it's

5057.88 --> 5062.7390000000005
not a flat disc it's a non-local

5060.699 --> 5064.78
hologram that you can't actually

5062.739 --> 5067.0599999999995
pinpoint you can't get there you can't

5064.78 --> 5069.04
see the angular size of it increase as

5067.06 --> 5071.5
you approach it like with all objects

5069.04 --> 5072.88
yeah isn't there

5071.5 --> 5075.42
yeah

5072.88 --> 5078.219
so just go with the ad homs like

5075.42 --> 5080.86
dopinora there who just got kicked out

5078.219 --> 5083.62
just go in the ad humps because you have

5080.86 --> 5089.259999999999
nothing you can win

5083.62 --> 5091.599999999999
you're just wrong the Earth is flat

5089.26 --> 5094.26
and the lights in the skies are not

5091.6 --> 5099.0
balls

5094.26 --> 5099.0
like you assume you're standing on

5106.3 --> 5109.360000000001
there's nothing to win here no no

5107.739 --> 5111.639999999999
there's some definitely something to win

5109.36 --> 5114.58
or you could win your mind back

5111.64 --> 5116.14
you can win logical reason

5114.58 --> 5118.96
and your

5116.14 --> 5122.76
sensibility you can win it back you can

5118.96 --> 5122.76
absolutely win it back

5123.28 --> 5129.099999999999
yeah that's why people actually turn

5126.88 --> 5130.96
into flat earthers because they can get

5129.1 --> 5132.9400000000005
their senses back

5130.96 --> 5135.1
right and it's worth it it's actually

5132.94 --> 5137.199
worth it despite like half the world

5135.1 --> 5139.719
suddenly turned completely [ __ ]

5137.199 --> 5143.799999999999
[ __ ] on you

5139.719 --> 5146.8
yeah despite that it's still worth it

5143.8 --> 5150.820000000001
it's really worth getting your mind back

5146.8 --> 5154.62
and knowing what is real again

5150.82 --> 5154.62
very much worth it

5166.679 --> 5172.84
alrighty just squirt for me in chat

5170.679 --> 5174.28
till it's done and you can't forget

5172.84 --> 5175.719
about it and you don't have to think

5174.28 --> 5178.12
about it anymore because it's very

5175.719 --> 5180.46
painful apparently for you

5178.12 --> 5183.12
because you think you went there you got

5180.46 --> 5183.12
grit right

5199.42 --> 5206.9400000000005
that that's a trick question

5203.08 --> 5206.94
or what where that's [ __ ]

5219.94 --> 5224.08
but you think that you know math and

5222.219 --> 5227.32
that makes you Superior because you know

5224.08 --> 5230.08
math you can't even Define common sense

5227.32 --> 5231.219
you can't even figure out basic common

5230.08 --> 5232.6
sense

5231.219 --> 5234.88
or what do you think you're better

5232.6 --> 5237.34
because of your [ __ ] math [ __ ] yeah

5234.88 --> 5241.56
it's a positive number you [ __ ] with

5237.34 --> 5241.56
can't never be a negative number

5242.139 --> 5248.56
but you think I'm stupid you're [ __ ]

5246.34 --> 5250.659000000001
yeah a number displayed like that is

5248.56 --> 5253.84
never negative

5250.659 --> 5257.5
yeah it doesn't matter how much you

5253.84 --> 5259.78
like multiply on itself by a minus

5257.5 --> 5260.62
number it's just going to be smaller

5259.78 --> 5264.9
than

5260.62 --> 5264.9
yeah I know how that works

5266.5 --> 5275.699
yeah I don't have to be good at math to

5269.26 --> 5275.6990000000005
be able to recognize how math works yeah

5280.98 --> 5289.718999999999
so stop how about you stop bickering

5286.139 --> 5293.139
and nagging other people in my chat that

5289.719 --> 5295.86
understand reality and actually address

5293.139 --> 5299.219
the conflicting visual information

5295.86 --> 5299.219
concerning the Moon

5308.98 --> 5314.199
racial people oh so important oh my God

5312.28 --> 5316.5599999999995
because if you if you get that answer

5314.199 --> 5320.86
wrong you [ __ ] it's negative

5316.56 --> 5322.659000000001
well then then you can talk about how

5320.86 --> 5324.04
the visual information concerning the

5322.659 --> 5327.159
Moon is conflicting then of course

5324.04 --> 5329.139
because if you get math wrong well then

5327.159 --> 5330.879999999999
well then you can't get anything right I

5329.139 --> 5332.92
mean if you've got math wrong then you

5330.88 --> 5335.02
can understand reality you can't trust

5332.92 --> 5338.52
your senses if you can't even get the

5335.02 --> 5338.52
math right right

5341.92 --> 5347.679
yeah no no it's actually completely

5344.98 --> 5350.62
useless and a distraction because this

5347.679 --> 5353.62
is not about getting a number or a

5350.62 --> 5355.599999999999
little piece of language which what is

5353.62 --> 5357.239
what math is it's not about getting that

5355.6 --> 5359.92
right this is about

5357.239 --> 5362.08
logical observation yeah that's what

5359.92 --> 5364.9
this show has been about exclusively

5362.08 --> 5367.42
it's in the title yeah the conflicting

5364.9 --> 5370.239
visual information which I've laid down

5367.42 --> 5372.639
now what is it

5370.239 --> 5376.379999999999
seven or eight times by now

5372.639 --> 5376.38
maybe 10 times I lost count

5378.52 --> 5383.92
so yeah keep bringing your math trick

5381.639 --> 5386.38
questions just ask math questions that's

5383.92 --> 5389.32
going to solve the conflicting visual

5386.38 --> 5392.9400000000005
information concerning the moon wanted

5389.32 --> 5392.94
maybe you got more math questions

5394.239 --> 5398.98
and and maybe if you ask more of those

5396.58 --> 5400.6
questions I'll stop referencing the

5398.98 --> 5402.459999999999
title of the show which is what the

5400.6 --> 5405.76
discussion is really about which are you

5402.46 --> 5409.62
which is what you are trying to avoid

5405.76 --> 5409.62
by bringing off stupid math questions

5426.52 --> 5432.9400000000005
yeah turret it's always happening they

5430.12 --> 5435.48
always do that it's just math

5432.94 --> 5435.48
right

5435.76 --> 5440.9800000000005
they can't get their stupid fantasy

5438.52 --> 5444.06
reality real then there's always math

5440.98 --> 5446.44
there's you could always dive into your

5444.06 --> 5448.2390000000005
universe that you created in the

5446.44 --> 5450.339999999999
language where you think that you can

5448.239 --> 5454.36
make anything work

5450.34 --> 5456.04
of course math math is the solution to

5454.36 --> 5459.04
get lost

5456.04 --> 5462.239
the lose track of what's real

5459.04 --> 5462.239
the low side of God

5467.199 --> 5473.739
or maybe some at home

5470.32 --> 5476.5
that that'll help that that [ __ ]

5473.739 --> 5478.239
it'll help you maybe some at home that

5476.5 --> 5479.5
will make your case because if you're

5478.239 --> 5481.839999999999
angry

5479.5 --> 5484.239
well then the argument doesn't count

5481.84 --> 5486.76
anymore right I mean if you just get

5484.239 --> 5489.4
angry and you just try to make me angry

5486.76 --> 5492.639
then things will be all right

5489.4 --> 5494.699
because you don't have to address the in

5492.639 --> 5497.92
your face

5494.699 --> 5501.879999999999
conflicting visual information that that

5497.92 --> 5506.1
you have the chance to behold

5501.88 --> 5506.1
like on a monthly basis

5506.32 --> 5511.42
right so just bring out math bring out

5508.78 --> 5512.86
at home bring out your sock accounts

5511.42 --> 5515.7390000000005
right

5512.86 --> 5517.719
so you don't have to address how the

5515.739 --> 5519.94
visual information concerning the Moon

5517.719 --> 5521.26
is conflicting

5519.94 --> 5523.138999999999
yeah

5521.26 --> 5526.06
as far as a shadow play

5523.139 --> 5529.06
suggests that it might be some kind of a

5526.06 --> 5532.179
sphere being lit up from an angle

5529.06 --> 5534.580000000001
but then when it's actually mostly full

5532.179 --> 5537.04
kind of bright yeah then

5534.58 --> 5538.3
it doesn't look like a sphere really now

5537.04 --> 5540.5199999999995
does it

5538.3 --> 5542.62
because the light coming off it is All

5540.52 --> 5544.659000000001
Uniform at the middle and on the side

5542.62 --> 5546.88
and that's not really what happens when

5544.659 --> 5549.339999999999
you light up a sphere

5546.88 --> 5551.679
in the dark with a singular light source

5549.34 --> 5553.78
now is it it's not really what a sphere

5551.679 --> 5555.52
lit up looks like does it

5553.78 --> 5556.719
so that's officially conflicting

5555.52 --> 5559.06
information

5556.719 --> 5561.4
but maybe you should at home some more

5559.06 --> 5563.38
bring out some stupid math problems to

5561.4 --> 5565.96
mat to mask that

5563.38 --> 5568.36
so so you can forget about that basic

5565.96 --> 5570.639
rudimentary visual logic

5568.36 --> 5573.339999999999
so you don't have to think about it

5570.639 --> 5576.659000000001
oh that doesn't make any sense if you

5573.34 --> 5576.659000000001
really believe the Moon is as Fair

5577.06 --> 5579.659000000001
right

5591.08 --> 5594.17
[Music]

5600.58 --> 5603.3
yes

5603.58 --> 5608.86
oh you would be so angry if you were me

5606.34 --> 5610.96
that you're going to assume is in

5608.86 --> 5612.94
ignorant even though you can't literally

5610.96 --> 5614.8
address

5612.94 --> 5617.0199999999995
the basic

5614.8 --> 5621.4800000000005
statement that is the title of the show

5617.02 --> 5621.4800000000005
biggest Doggers huh

5637.98 --> 5643.78
distance here with a rough surface

5640.6 --> 5647.219
illuminated by a much larger light no no

5643.78 --> 5647.219
it doesn't look like that at all

5650.5 --> 5656.26
because you're probably gonna do that in

5653.679 --> 5659.679
a setting where it's so bright so large

5656.26 --> 5662.92
and then it's gonna scatter isn't it

5659.679 --> 5664.42
it's gonna scatter of the building you

5662.92 --> 5668.4400000000005
are inside

5664.42 --> 5670.6
yeah or off the floor really big light

5668.44 --> 5673.36
source yeah off the floor yeah guess

5670.6 --> 5676.6
what in space

5673.36 --> 5681.58
oh the final frontier yeah there isn't

5676.6 --> 5684.6990000000005
the floor or the walls or the ceiling to

5681.58 --> 5687.159
reflect that sunlight right back onto

5684.699 --> 5690.82
that sphere huh yeah that that's not

5687.159 --> 5693.638999999999
there is it yeah because in space there

5690.82 --> 5697.179
is no opportunities for light to scatter

5693.639 --> 5699.88
to reflect things like light on two

5697.179 --> 5702.219
things in there so you can see them

5699.88 --> 5703.719
better because they're being lit from

5702.219 --> 5706.54
multiple directions because of the

5703.719 --> 5709.54
lights scattering yeah yeah yeah now try

5706.54 --> 5712.36
that in a really dark room try some

5709.54 --> 5713.98
velvet everywhere some black velvet that

5712.36 --> 5716.5599999999995
absorbs the light

5713.98 --> 5719.739
so there's no light scattering

5716.56 --> 5722.5
and then take that light source

5719.739 --> 5725.62
from One Direction and let's see what

5722.5 --> 5727.78
happens yeah there's no light scattering

5725.62 --> 5730.42
then yeah it's because the scattering in

5727.78 --> 5733.42
in a physical environment objects the

5730.42 --> 5737.52
floor the walls the ceiling it's gonna

5733.42 --> 5737.52
scatter that light isn't it yeah

5737.92 --> 5740.9800000000005
yeah and then yeah it's gonna

5739.12 --> 5742.9
effectively be lit up from other

5740.98 --> 5745.299999999999
directions and it might look like it's

5742.9 --> 5749.58
more lit up uniform that way that's why

5745.3 --> 5749.58
I specifically say in the dark

5749.8 --> 5757.3
so there's no light scattering in order

5753.34 --> 5759.6990000000005
for that Moon emulation sphere to be lit

5757.3 --> 5760.78
up from other directions but do it in

5759.699 --> 5763.239
the dark

5760.78 --> 5765.88
one single light source

5763.239 --> 5767.739
doesn't matter whether it's big or small

5765.88 --> 5770.4400000000005
far away even

5767.739 --> 5771.459999999999
doesn't matter all that much really to

5770.44 --> 5773.739
test it

5771.46 --> 5775.5
you don't need to confiscate an entire

5773.739 --> 5779.44
Warehouse

5775.5 --> 5782.26
and cover it in velvet just to do it at

5779.44 --> 5785.138999999999
the supposed to scale distance or

5782.26 --> 5787.900000000001
whatever that's not necessary

5785.139 --> 5790.2390000000005
it's not doable either really

5787.9 --> 5791.98
right but what you do need

5790.239 --> 5793.54
is to make sure that if you're going to

5791.98 --> 5796.9
have that light source that it's not

5793.54 --> 5799.84
going to be reflecting off the walls the

5796.9 --> 5803.199
floor the ceiling in order to scatter

5799.84 --> 5806.8
that light from another angle back onto

5803.199 --> 5808.178999999999
that sphere you're doing the test on

5806.8 --> 5811.3
yeah

5808.179 --> 5813.219
if I just take a sphere right here and I

5811.3 --> 5814.84
just shine a lighter yes just gonna look

5813.219 --> 5816.88
kind of uniform because they're

5814.84 --> 5819.1
scattering from all over the place yeah

5816.88 --> 5822.58
there's no scattering in space because

5819.1 --> 5824.620000000001
there's nothing to scatter off is there

5822.58 --> 5827.46
doesn't really work like that in your

5824.62 --> 5827.46
model does it

5833.139 --> 5839.5
see [ __ ] when it's right in your eye

5836.5 --> 5841.48
no biggest dog is you're a [ __ ]

5839.5 --> 5845.52
[ __ ] you're a ball tart you think you

5841.48 --> 5845.5199999999995
got grit you think you went to the Moon

5846.28 --> 5850.48
can't go there it's not an object

5849.28 --> 5852.28
yeah

5850.48 --> 5854.138999999999
and Visually

5852.28 --> 5856.92
it's very confusing because there's

5854.139 --> 5856.92
conflicting information

5857.62 --> 5864.699
yeah Shadow play Oh suggestion of

5860.38 --> 5866.1990000000005
sphericity oh fully lit up ooh not

5864.699 --> 5868.9
really spherical

5866.199 --> 5872.678999999999
not at all

5868.9 --> 5877.138999999999
or like a flat mirror or something yeah

5872.679 --> 5880.0
but people call it that for good reason

5877.139 --> 5882.82
it's not

5880.0 --> 5884.44
a strange suggestion to say like oh it's

5882.82 --> 5886.239
flat

5884.44 --> 5888.759999999999
because the light coming off it when it

5886.239 --> 5891.339999999999
falls uniform that doesn't happen with

5888.76 --> 5895.4400000000005
the sphere whether it's a

5891.34 --> 5898.6
smooth sphere or whether it's a rough

5895.44 --> 5899.86
raggedy looking sphere it doesn't really

5898.6 --> 5901.360000000001
matter

5899.86 --> 5903.4
yeah

5901.36 --> 5906.5199999999995
when you light it up from one side in

5903.4 --> 5909.5199999999995
the darkness and there's no scattering

5906.52 --> 5911.56
yeah it's not gonna look

5909.52 --> 5915.1
like the moon does

5911.56 --> 5916.9800000000005
where the lumens coming off it at the

5915.1 --> 5919.96
edge

5916.98 --> 5922.12
is just as bright as the center that

5919.96 --> 5923.62
that doesn't happen when you light up a

5922.12 --> 5926.0199999999995
sphere

5923.62 --> 5927.82
whether it is rough surfaced or smooth

5926.02 --> 5930.52
surface doesn't really matter

5927.82 --> 5932.44
in the darkness without scattering from

5930.52 --> 5933.820000000001
other objects to light it up from other

5932.44 --> 5935.678999999999
sides yeah

5933.82 --> 5940.9
it's not what happens when you light up

5935.679 --> 5944.04
a sphere it's not uniformly lit up

5940.9 --> 5944.04
because it's a sphere

5948.88 --> 5954.52
like how do you when you draw a sphere

5952.06 --> 5958.4400000000005
right

5954.52 --> 5958.4400000000005
how do you make it look like a sphere

5961.36 --> 5964.259999999999
Shadow play

5965.739 --> 5971.799999999999
Shadow play right at the edge it's

5967.739 --> 5974.259999999999
darker why because that is what a sphere

5971.8 --> 5976.42
looks like

5974.26 --> 5978.04
you don't just take a circle just no

5976.42 --> 5981.159
this is a sphere then people say no

5978.04 --> 5982.48
that's literally a circle it's just a a

5981.159 --> 5984.759999999999
circle

5982.48 --> 5987.28
that's not a sphere it doesn't have 3D

5984.76 --> 5989.860000000001
elements to it there's no Shadow play

5987.28 --> 5993.599999999999
spheres have light as light and Shadow

5989.86 --> 5993.599999999999
play that's how you know it's a sphere

5993.82 --> 6000.0599999999995
oh oh oh yeah

5997.54 --> 6001.739
I did a lot of drawing classes in my day

6000.06 --> 6004.620000000001
so

6001.739 --> 6006.839999999999
I know how to draw spheres yeah you

6004.62 --> 6010.46
recognize them by their Shadow play yeah

6006.84 --> 6013.9800000000005
the shadow play is in it's gonna be

6010.46 --> 6015.4800000000005
darker at the edge of the sphere always

6013.98 --> 6017.879999999999
yeah

6015.48 --> 6021.54
I'm not talking about oh well you know

6017.88 --> 6022.9800000000005
it's fear by a shadow going over the

6021.54 --> 6025.26
sphere now that's not the shadow play

6022.98 --> 6028.5
I'm talking I'm talking about

6025.26 --> 6031.56
take a sphere you're gonna darken the

6028.5 --> 6034.139
edge of that sphere

6031.56 --> 6036.719
in your drawing because then it actually

6034.139 --> 6039.42
looks like a sphere that way yeah

6036.719 --> 6040.9800000000005
otherwise it's just a circle

6039.42 --> 6043.9800000000005
yeah

6040.98 --> 6046.678999999999
why would that be why would you be

6043.98 --> 6048.9
putting Shadow at the edge

6046.679 --> 6049.8
of a circle to make it look like a

6048.9 --> 6053.239
sphere

6049.8 --> 6057.96
because it looks like a sphere that way

6053.239 --> 6059.82
because spheres look that way

6057.96 --> 6060.719
because when you put a light on the

6059.82 --> 6063.54
sphere

6060.719 --> 6065.699
it's gonna not gonna be as bright on the

6063.54 --> 6067.5
edge of it yeah

6065.699 --> 6070.199
when the sphere is coming from the

6067.5 --> 6073.02
observer's direction in the drawing

6070.199 --> 6074.94
yeah that's how you make a sphere

6073.02 --> 6077.040000000001
you don't seem to get it that the moon

6074.94 --> 6080.099999999999
doesn't have that the moon doesn't look

6077.04 --> 6082.56
like a sphere the brightness of it is

6080.1 --> 6085.56
equal everywhere

6082.56 --> 6088.1990000000005
all over it when it is full it's not a

6085.56 --> 6090.92
sphere spheres don't look that way

6088.199 --> 6090.919999999999
huh

6091.5 --> 6096.78
how many

6092.94 --> 6098.879999999999
hours do I need to repeat this

6096.78 --> 6101.099999999999
you guys are just not listening you just

6098.88 --> 6103.1990000000005
Boomer pieces of [ __ ]

6101.1 --> 6105.06
got [ __ ] in your ears

6103.199 --> 6107.04
you don't listen you don't listen to

6105.06 --> 6111.0
reason

6107.04 --> 6113.9
keep regurgitating your objections

6111.0 --> 6113.9
you're idiots

6132.3 --> 6135.26
foreign

6138.619 --> 6144.9
I mean this is this is gonna trigger

6141.9 --> 6147.659
some people good trigger feel the pain

6144.9 --> 6150.239
you're wrong you were always wrong the

6147.659 --> 6153.42
Earth is flat it's not a globe you're a

6150.239 --> 6155.879999999999
[ __ ] for believing it

6153.42 --> 6157.619
you really are stupid for believing the

6155.88 --> 6160.619
Earth is a globe

6157.619 --> 6165.239
especially after this session

6160.619 --> 6167.699
because yeah I trust logic and I trust

6165.239 --> 6170.879999999999
my eyes and I have experience with my

6167.699 --> 6174.299999999999
eyes I've experienced with art

6170.88 --> 6175.9800000000005
right the the eye mechanisms of sizing

6174.3 --> 6177.659000000001
things up what it's looking at I have a

6175.98 --> 6179.159
lot of experience with that

6177.659 --> 6182.46
yeah

6179.159 --> 6184.44
and I know that the moon when it's full

6182.46 --> 6186.36
that's not a sphere that's not what a

6184.44 --> 6188.759999999999
lit up sphere looks like it had been

6186.36 --> 6191.699
saying this now for

6188.76 --> 6194.400000000001
countless amounts in this show and

6191.699 --> 6196.259999999999
people in chat are still just yo you're

6194.4 --> 6198.119
returning you don't know what it really

6196.26 --> 6199.56
looks like over the smooth sphere only

6198.119 --> 6201.239
looks like that the Moon is not smooth

6199.56 --> 6203.88
it doesn't look like that without any

6201.239 --> 6205.379999999999
backing whatsoever to that claim

6203.88 --> 6208.52
meanwhile

6205.38 --> 6210.3
I'm giving detailed

6208.52 --> 6212.159000000001
rollouts of

6210.3 --> 6214.139
how it would look like

6212.159 --> 6216.119
scenario what the environment would be

6214.139 --> 6219.26
like what's happening

6216.119 --> 6222.119
logic behind it there's no robot to that

6219.26 --> 6225.42
nobody's actually addressing the like

6222.119 --> 6227.88
what I've been explaining not really

6225.42 --> 6231.0
just say no no it doesn't look like that

6227.88 --> 6233.88
because your sphere looks like a moon

6231.0 --> 6236.4
yeah winds in the sky then spheres look

6233.88 --> 6238.02
like the Moon yeah so a sphere in

6236.4 --> 6241.619
reality yeah it doesn't look like that

6238.02 --> 6243.540000000001
but when it's up there then it doesn't

6241.619 --> 6245.4
have to look like a sphere you could

6243.54 --> 6247.679
just think of it as a sphere right

6245.4 --> 6250.619
because everything is fair

6247.679 --> 6254.219
so I mean it's just a

6250.619 --> 6256.92
a circle a disc uniformly lit up right

6254.219 --> 6258.659
that's a sphere you go it's just a

6256.92 --> 6260.46
sphere just don't think about it too

6258.659 --> 6264.679
much

6260.46 --> 6264.679
they specially don't listen to Arwin

6271.26 --> 6278.159000000001
no evidence is being presented dude you

6274.92 --> 6282.32
literally gave me a link

6278.159 --> 6282.32
to a picture of the moon

6282.44 --> 6289.32
you gave me the evidence

6286.38 --> 6291.900000000001
the picture of the Moon yeah the

6289.32 --> 6294.719
brightness of the center of that picture

6291.9 --> 6298.86
of the Moon versus the brightness

6294.719 --> 6301.679
of the edge of the Moon where the same I

6298.86 --> 6304.739
don't even need to like process it

6301.679 --> 6307.02
through show Photoshop to know that a

6304.739 --> 6308.4
very good eyes

6307.02 --> 6311.639
yeah

6308.4 --> 6315.659
brightness at the center of the Moon the

6311.639 --> 6317.46
same as the edges like right next to it

6315.659 --> 6319.32
right next to the edge is the same

6317.46 --> 6320.639
brightness yeah that doesn't happen on a

6319.32 --> 6324.9
sphere

6320.639 --> 6328.219
it's gonna get gradually more shady

6324.9 --> 6328.219
that's how that really works

6329.219 --> 6333.44
yeah that's not what the Moon looks like

6334.5 --> 6339.659
let us see no

6337.02 --> 6341.52
the guy baller posted the link I don't

6339.659 --> 6342.96
why the hell would I show you I'm not

6341.52 --> 6345.42
gonna

6342.96 --> 6347.4
do that I don't need to do that you

6345.42 --> 6351.719
could look any picture of the Moon just

6347.4 --> 6355.379999999999
any picture of the Moon guys any picture

6351.719 --> 6358.199
it's a full moon and you analyze the

6355.38 --> 6360.4800000000005
brightness of the center versus The Edge

6358.199 --> 6363.44
that's not a sphere

6360.48 --> 6363.44
don't you get it

6372.0 --> 6378.9
don't need to do yeah I don't

6375.84 --> 6381.06
any picture of the moon when it's full

6378.9 --> 6384.138999999999
compare the brightness at the center of

6381.06 --> 6384.139
it and then at the edge

6386.219 --> 6390.9
looks yeah but what is the actual

6388.92 --> 6393.3
brightness though

6390.9 --> 6395.5199999999995
brightness is the same I know you it

6393.3 --> 6397.38
looks in your mind because this has to

6395.52 --> 6401.280000000001
be is fierce I'm sure you're literally

6397.38 --> 6402.719
gonna rape your own [ __ ] mind to make

6401.28 --> 6404.639
it look like a sphere but you're not

6402.719 --> 6407.34
gonna measure the brightness are you

6404.639 --> 6410.46
yeah is it right this is the same

6407.34 --> 6412.4400000000005
there's no Shadow there it's not a

6410.46 --> 6414.2390000000005
sphere shadow that you're seeing there

6412.44 --> 6416.219
yeah yeah I know in your mind you can

6414.239 --> 6418.379999999999
twist it around some more

6416.219 --> 6420.4800000000005
rape your own mind with your sphere

6418.38 --> 6422.28
convictions huh

6420.48 --> 6424.379999999999
keep doing it

6422.28 --> 6427.94
keep raping your own mind with your

6424.38 --> 6427.9400000000005
spare convictions huh

6428.04 --> 6432.78
anything can be a sphere if you just

6430.44 --> 6434.638999999999
rate your mind and force yourself to

6432.78 --> 6435.96
believe that this is fair okay that's

6434.639 --> 6439.139
very easy

6435.96 --> 6442.04
you just [ __ ] yourself over

6439.139 --> 6442.04
with your belief

6456.26 --> 6462.96
do you even know how to measure light

6458.52 --> 6464.76
intensity yeah color

6462.96 --> 6467.78
take the average

6464.76 --> 6467.780000000001
it's very simple

6489.98 --> 6494.4
it can in your mind all you have to do

6492.239 --> 6496.199
is just [ __ ] your own head over and

6494.4 --> 6497.879999999999
everything can become a sphere even if

6496.199 --> 6500.099999999999
it doesn't make any sense

6497.88 --> 6502.46
anything can become a sphere including

6500.1 --> 6502.46
the Moon

6506.159 --> 6510.54
what the value of the words I measured I

6508.92 --> 6513.06
didn't measure anything I looked at it

6510.54 --> 6515.88
and I noticed ha looking at the middle

6513.06 --> 6517.860000000001
I'm looking at the side is exactly the

6515.88 --> 6520.26
same it's the same brightness

6517.86 --> 6521.5199999999995
there's no Shadow play happening there

6520.26 --> 6523.679
yeah

6521.52 --> 6526.139
I don't need to measure I don't need to

6523.679 --> 6528.4800000000005
give you numbers I know you're all lit

6526.139 --> 6530.6990000000005
to the numbers because I gave you some

6528.48 --> 6532.199
number then you could like throw it in

6530.699 --> 6536.219
some stupid

6532.199 --> 6537.96
number thingy machine calculator blah

6536.219 --> 6540.119
blah blah machination and then tell me

6537.96 --> 6542.159
oh see no no that's exactly how it's

6540.119 --> 6545.159
supposed to be because that is all you

6542.159 --> 6549.179
want to do you just want to say no Arwin

6545.159 --> 6552.0599999999995
no it doesn't matter it is as Fair see

6549.179 --> 6554.6990000000005
we got some stupid calculation [ __ ]

6552.06 --> 6557.04
mechanism here to prove you that the

6554.699 --> 6558.96
data you gave us proves this is fair I

6557.04 --> 6561.84
know it makes no [ __ ] sense it's just

6558.96 --> 6564.0
a bunch of calculus garbage but you have

6561.84 --> 6565.08
to trust under this yeah you gotta trust

6564.0 --> 6568.679
us on this

6565.08 --> 6571.94
because the Moon is as Fair as real we

6568.679 --> 6571.9400000000005
went there we got Grit

6572.3 --> 6577.38
yeah no

6575.1 --> 6579.659000000001
I'm just gonna trust my eyes and Trust

6577.38 --> 6582.119
logic and my experience with drawing and

6579.659 --> 6584.5199999999995
observing and Light

6582.119 --> 6587.099999999999
and I'm gonna conclude that the Moon is

6584.52 --> 6592.02
not as Fair because spheres don't like

6587.1 --> 6592.02
up light up like the moon does huh

6597.42 --> 6602.34
thank you

6599.3 --> 6603.54
for reposting that picture that's just

6602.34 --> 6606.8
cute

6603.54 --> 6606.8
people can do it themselves

6609.48 --> 6615.0599999999995
oh it looks like I no no no dude I want

6612.42 --> 6617.1
you to [ __ ] [ __ ] off I want you to

6615.06 --> 6619.38
jump off a [ __ ] building

6617.1 --> 6621.54
dude I don't give a [ __ ] what you do I

6619.38 --> 6624.36
don't give a [ __ ] what you believe I

6621.54 --> 6626.94
just like to show everybody how [ __ ]

6624.36 --> 6628.199
double think [ __ ] you people really

6626.94 --> 6630.659
are

6628.199 --> 6633.659
that's what I like to do I like to show

6630.659 --> 6634.86
the world how [ __ ] [ __ ] Ballers

6633.659 --> 6638.46
are

6634.86 --> 6641.159
they can't literally see logical truth

6638.46 --> 6644.04
when it's writing from their face

6641.159 --> 6646.5
and I want to prove it and I did today I

6644.04 --> 6648.36
did prove that to everybody that could

6646.5 --> 6652.02
watch the show

6648.36 --> 6654.199
how incredibly [ __ ] ball Believers

6652.02 --> 6654.1990000000005
are

6655.699 --> 6659.28
I don't give a [ __ ] what you do with

6657.9 --> 6661.5599999999995
your life I don't give a [ __ ] what you

6659.28 --> 6663.84
believe after all this I don't give a

6661.56 --> 6665.639
[ __ ] dude I don't care what the hell

6663.84 --> 6667.5
happens to you people that are that

6665.639 --> 6669.6
[ __ ]

6667.5 --> 6671.76
in my opinion this [ __ ] should go off

6669.6 --> 6674.04
and die

6671.76 --> 6676.08
make room for people that still have

6674.04 --> 6678.619
faculties left

6676.08 --> 6678.619
yeah

6678.84 --> 6681.860000000001

6682.5 --> 6685.46
take your shots

6685.679 --> 6691.02
I mean the new ones are gonna help right

6689.04 --> 6693.119
just go ahead

6691.02 --> 6696.06

6693.119 --> 6698.58
think or do or what you conclude I'm
