whether today is unfortunately not so

103.92 --> 110.0
beautiful

105.6 --> 110.0
it's a big gray suit this time

110.46 --> 115.13999999999999
yesterday was some really interesting

112.92 --> 116.82000000000001
weather from very beautiful to very

115.14 --> 120.32
clouded and rainy

116.82 --> 120.32
actually got wet

121.38 --> 125.119
when I went out for groceries

128.7 --> 133.14
because of that but yeah today it's all

131.58 --> 135.12
just great soup

133.14 --> 137.35999999999999
doesn't look like it's gonna be raining

135.12 --> 137.36
though

138.36 --> 141.26000000000002
but uh

143.04 --> 148.2
yeah it does seem like it's cooled off

146.04 --> 151.099
quite a bit

148.2 --> 151.099
I'd say

151.26 --> 154.34
hey what's going on

159.0 --> 162.14
what's happened to the camera

164.519 --> 167.519
foreign

172.519 --> 176.0
what's going on

179.04 --> 183.98
just looking on YouTube and it seems

181.26 --> 183.98
like it's stuck

184.8 --> 188.58
but it might be just a glitch I

186.84 --> 190.31900000000002
refreshed and I have to get through the

188.58 --> 194.519
ads oh no it's still going okay okay

190.319 --> 198.17999999999998
that was weird it just got stuck

194.519 --> 201.659
but it didn't in OBS now it's just

198.18 --> 204.08
weird anyway hello Oz first in chat good

201.659 --> 204.07999999999998
to see you

205.019 --> 211.62
it is Friday the 1st of September 2023

213.319 --> 217.73899999999998
let's check the temperature yeah I got a

216.06 --> 219.86
bit of drilling unfortunately in the

217.739 --> 219.86
house

220.44 --> 227.28
I don't think it obvious picks it up too

222.959 --> 229.08
much yeah 17 degrees Celsius

227.28 --> 231.42
much cooler

229.08 --> 234.0
than what we've had

231.42 --> 235.26
it says it's going to warm up again next

234.0 --> 238.22
week though

235.26 --> 238.22
we'll see

244.739 --> 248.34
right it definitely feels like the end

246.9 --> 252.799
of summer

248.34 --> 252.799
low low fruit let's see you

289.5 --> 296.28
all righty then

292.82 --> 298.56
we can all go to fake space today this

296.28 --> 301.09999999999997
is right

298.56 --> 303.0
no

301.1 --> 306.18
[Music]

303.0 --> 309.0
in Starfield yeah of course now you

306.18 --> 311.28000000000003
always be able to have space in from a

309.0 --> 314.96
Hollywood basement and

311.28 --> 314.96
from your computer screen

315.0 --> 319.4
just don't expect it in there really is

317.1 --> 319.40000000000003
world

323.52 --> 326.12
okay

328.5 --> 333.06
to me it's kind of weird all those types

330.6 --> 337.5
of space games

333.06 --> 340.259
like three decades ago I was like that's

337.5 --> 342.96
exactly what I was longing for

340.259 --> 346.039
but now now that they're all coming out

342.96 --> 349.919
one after another it's like

346.039 --> 353.06
yeah it just doesn't do it anymore for

349.919 --> 353.06
me it's like

356.82 --> 362.58
know maybe you'd have to be a real

359.4 --> 365.69899999999996
baller to actually be able to enjoy that

362.58 --> 368.78
or maybe not I mean there are some space

365.699 --> 371.28000000000003
themed games that I do like occasionally

368.78 --> 372.84
like endless space

371.28 --> 375.59999999999997
but

372.84 --> 378.5
yeah I'm just not really into games

375.6 --> 378.5
anymore I think

378.539 --> 383.34
not that much

380.52 --> 387.139
not so eager to check out new ones

383.34 --> 387.13899999999995
hello Richard G good to see you

396.68 --> 400.139
your daughter pays for your game trees

399.24 --> 403.039
what

400.139 --> 403.039
okay

408.36 --> 410.36
okay

416.72 --> 421.74
right okay look yeah whatever you like

419.88 --> 424.86
man

421.74 --> 426.84000000000003
yeah I'm dipping into an old game and I

424.86 --> 431.46000000000004
forgot to even add

426.84 --> 433.09999999999997
in 2015 called hands hand of Fate it's

431.46 --> 437.52
like a

433.1 --> 440.72
role-playing but card based game

437.52 --> 440.71999999999997
very stylish

441.24 --> 447.78000000000003
like it's it's really well constructed

444.9 --> 450.06
but uh

447.78 --> 453.35999999999996
you can't play it for too long it'll

450.06 --> 454.319
drive you nuts I remember that from the

453.36 --> 456.36
game

454.319 --> 458.34000000000003
but yeah I still had it on my computer

456.36 --> 461.599
so that was kind of fun

458.34 --> 465.17999999999995
just doing something new or well

461.599 --> 469.639
something different it's not exactly new

465.18 --> 469.639
hello moon buggy good to see you

476.28 --> 480.5
yeah yesterday's fpd was pretty good

481.62 --> 486.419
this

482.9 --> 489.17999999999995
just more

486.419 --> 491.34
people trying to get on

489.18 --> 493.319
maybe it's like all the anti-flat

491.34 --> 495.17999999999995
earthers needed to ripen during this

493.319 --> 496.62
summer and now that it's harvest season

495.18 --> 500.3
now all the

496.62 --> 500.3
anti-flat earthers and

501.84 --> 508.73999999999995
Globe buster

504.599 --> 510.84
lore followers are all like presenting

508.74 --> 515.12
themselves over at fed all of a sudden

510.84 --> 515.12
it's like all the apples have ripened

529.32 --> 532.0400000000001
okay

548.58 --> 554.4590000000001
man I realized something about myself

551.339 --> 556.9200000000001
yesterday which is pretty crazy and that

554.459 --> 561.1999999999999
is that

556.92 --> 561.1999999999999
just that silly appointment I had

562.26 --> 567.18
where base because I didn't exactly know

564.66 --> 569.16
what to expect but just like the

567.18 --> 572.459
excitement and nervousness of it all

569.16 --> 575.5799999999999
like it literally like afterward I got

572.459 --> 577.8
like super a super amount of energy the

575.58 --> 580.0400000000001
show went pretty well I thought my own

577.8 --> 580.04
show

580.68 --> 585.3599999999999
but like that energy just kept going I

583.32 --> 587.58
was like yesterday I was like really

585.36 --> 590.339
hungry all day

587.58 --> 594.38
and like really activated

590.339 --> 594.3800000000001
but it also kept me up very late

596.519 --> 601.92
it's weird

598.62 --> 604.86
I guess I'm I'm so not used to like

601.92 --> 606.959
doing anything else other than my

604.86 --> 609.66
routine activities

606.959 --> 612.54
which include the show and all that that

609.66 --> 614.76
like just doing a thing that's really

612.54 --> 617.8199999999999
different

614.76 --> 620.279
like really breaks me out of the rut I

617.82 --> 622.7
guess and I get so much excess energy is

620.279 --> 622.7
weird

624.12 --> 629.58
but it's all conditional though it's all

626.399 --> 632.0
because of that moment I mean I know

629.58 --> 634.2
it's just like a drug like the more

632.0 --> 637.44
unexpected new things you start to do

634.2 --> 640.1600000000001
the less of a kick you'll get out of it

637.44 --> 640.1600000000001
so

640.86 --> 647.5790000000001
it just really stood out to me like man

643.8 --> 650.4799999999999
I feel so energized and so hungry too

647.579 --> 650.4799999999999
it's just weird

657.839 --> 660.5
okay

668.88 --> 671.54
right

673.04 --> 678.24
yeah anyway I played been playing hands

676.38 --> 680.16
of Fate I also because I I like the

678.24 --> 682.98
music and it

680.16 --> 685.62
in the voice is also pretty decent but

682.98 --> 689.5790000000001
it does get on on your nerves eventually

685.62 --> 692.64
so I turn it off but the music is like

689.579 --> 696.0
it's like Diablo style it's just a

692.64 --> 698.1
guitar play in that stuff in that kind

696.0 --> 699.48
of style it is like in a way kind of

698.1 --> 701.88
gypsy-ish

699.48 --> 704.839
gypsy-ish

701.88 --> 704.8389999999999
all of it

705.36 --> 714.8000000000001
but I mean the music I like about that

709.339 --> 714.8000000000001
I like a good classical guitar score

721.14 --> 725.519
right

722.64 --> 727.8
also it makes me think I I really do

725.519 --> 730.74
kind of want to get back to

727.8 --> 734.3599999999999
to just Dungeons and Dragons

730.74 --> 734.36
like I want to do that again

741.48 --> 746.04
thank you

743.779 --> 748.92
so how am I going to get a new group

746.04 --> 751.74
that's not freaking tied into freaking

748.92 --> 753.959
Facebook because they always sit on

751.74 --> 756.62
Facebook and that crap

753.959 --> 756.6199999999999
I don't

763.079 --> 767.16
oh witson is having some bad things in

765.3 --> 769.76
his life oh

767.16 --> 769.76
okay

773.519 --> 779.04
do you know that like what type of bad

776.88 --> 782.0
things

779.04 --> 782.0
like family

782.82 --> 788.0
or health

785.279 --> 788.0
what

791.82 --> 795.6800000000001
or you didn't say

816.36 --> 818.899
oh

823.38 --> 825.4399999999999
cool

826.31 --> 829.6199999999999
[Music]

831.2 --> 838.279
oh [ __ ]

834.06 --> 838.279
sister is missing what

844.32 --> 846.9200000000001
uh

873.2 --> 878.88
right so yeah I guess you gotta streak a

876.24 --> 882.32
bad luck but I mean that sister missing

878.88 --> 882.32
that is really worrisome though

897.899 --> 900.079
foreign

911.91 --> 915.169
[Music]

920.22 --> 924.72
I actually had this idea of like a whole

922.92 --> 928.279
conversation rolling out but I guess

924.72 --> 928.279
that the chemistry is not right

929.339 --> 936.5600000000001
like the field isn't right for it

933.3 --> 936.56
anyway weird

937.199 --> 942.8
let's just move on and

939.779 --> 942.8
see what happens

945.92 --> 952.26
I was just watching a Quantum of

949.56 --> 954.06
conscious I was talking about the

952.26 --> 957.899
separation with the Ship of Fools and

954.06 --> 961.199
all that and just thinking about that

957.899 --> 964.38
like the the different type of tracks

961.199 --> 966.18
that you can walk spiritually

964.38 --> 969.66
and what that does and how you can

966.18 --> 971.9399999999999
switch how that works

969.66 --> 975.98
like I wish I could like lay it out

971.94 --> 975.98
exactly like how I see it in my head

976.92 --> 980.42
because there is like a picture

981.06 --> 986.279
it's like statistics of

984.18 --> 989.0
things

986.279 --> 994.26
you see it's almost like little

989.0 --> 994.26
ribbons of sort of translucent

995.94 --> 1000.8000000000001
what would that be water

998.82 --> 1003.44
yeah it's not showing any actual

1000.8 --> 1006.38
material Properties or any type of

1003.44 --> 1008.6
motion so it's just the resemblance of

1006.38 --> 1012.3389999999999
materials just seeming but it could be

1008.6 --> 1012.339
like glass or water or something

1013.1 --> 1017.6
and you just have these different

1015.74 --> 1020.12
Heights

1017.6 --> 1022.519
at which you can operate

1020.12 --> 1025.22
but then there's effects like if you get

1022.519 --> 1027.52
pulled into a higher Consciousness mode

1025.22 --> 1029.959
when you're not

1027.52 --> 1032.78
developed enough

1029.959 --> 1035.78
to actually

1032.78 --> 1037.52
hold on to all the responsibilities that

1035.78 --> 1039.319
come with that frequency then you can

1037.52 --> 1040.459
typically like be seduced to the dark

1039.319 --> 1045.579
side

1040.459 --> 1045.579
and and be seduced to abuse it

1048.5 --> 1051.799
and yeah that's basically what I wanted

1050.24 --> 1054.2
to say

1051.799 --> 1056.6
like how that works

1054.2 --> 1059.3600000000001
like if somebody awakens you you get

1056.6 --> 1063.559
very curious

1059.36 --> 1065.1789999999999
but also like you can feel like yeah you

1063.559 --> 1067.7
don't actually know what to do with it

1065.179 --> 1069.799
like it what you learn doesn't

1067.7 --> 1072.02
fit into

1069.799 --> 1075.28
what you were planning what you were

1072.02 --> 1075.28
doing what you were developing

1078.5 --> 1085.039
but if you then still see the full

1081.5 --> 1086.48
implications of the new knowledge

1085.039 --> 1088.82
then

1086.48 --> 1090.74
you might see like how that completely

1088.82 --> 1092.96
negates everything that you were doing

1090.74 --> 1094.16
that's typically what happens when you

1092.96 --> 1096.5
awaken

1094.16 --> 1098.96
because things that you're stuck on a

1096.5 --> 1100.58
certain track in your production in your

1098.96 --> 1103.1000000000001
inspiration sources

1100.58 --> 1105.98
when you're on a certain level well if

1103.1 --> 1109.34
you then suddenly see massive new

1105.98 --> 1111.919
implications based information

1109.34 --> 1114.6789999999999
that really awakened you well then you

1111.919 --> 1115.8200000000002
see like how what you were doing is

1114.679 --> 1120.1000000000001
folly

1115.82 --> 1120.1
basically that that typically happens

1121.64 --> 1127.16
and then that can give you look because

1125.539 --> 1129.919
there's like a

1127.16 --> 1132.559
there's always the ego

1129.919 --> 1134.9
that responds to whatever situation

1132.559 --> 1136.58
happens basically and if you realize

1134.9 --> 1138.44
suddenly that everything you did was for

1136.58 --> 1140.059
nothing well then you can get agitated

1138.44 --> 1143.3200000000002
about that

1140.059 --> 1143.32
and even like

1144.26 --> 1147.82
envious just like

1149.84 --> 1159.1
agitated with annoyed with and like

1153.919 --> 1159.1000000000001
yeah it's it's not NPS what's the word

1160.22 --> 1165.02
I can't I can't figure it out right now

1162.44 --> 1167.72
but

1165.02 --> 1170.72
so in that sense it does seduce you like

1167.72 --> 1174.8600000000001
get getting suddenly informed about

1170.72 --> 1177.14
things on a higher level when you're not

1174.86 --> 1180.32
seeking it out when you're not ready for

1177.14 --> 1182.7990000000002
it can lead to like a tip over to the

1180.32 --> 1182.799
dark side

1183.5 --> 1188.96
because of the ego implications of what

1186.2 --> 1191.2
it does to you and this is probably also

1188.96 --> 1195.44
what sometimes gives people those

1191.2 --> 1198.2
extreme aggressive reactions

1195.44 --> 1200.179
and it has a dual function the mechanism

1198.2 --> 1202.66
of the extremely aggressive reaction

1200.179 --> 1205.94
with social peer pressure and everything

1202.66 --> 1206.78
is to first off distort the train of

1205.94 --> 1209.179
thought

1206.78 --> 1213.7
and then to basically create an

1209.179 --> 1217.76
emotional Calamity that will help assist

1213.7 --> 1219.919
after it's done to forget all about it

1217.76 --> 1222.32
because everybody Associated will have

1219.919 --> 1226.3400000000001
that extremity confronted with them the

1222.32 --> 1228.3799999999999
extreme behavior that will initiate the

1226.34 --> 1230.08
Aesthetics mind

1228.38 --> 1234.5590000000002
to then

1230.08 --> 1237.8799999999999
supplant it in their memory

1234.559 --> 1237.8799999999999
and thereby

1237.98 --> 1242.419
creating a memory block with the

1240.26 --> 1244.94
information so that you can continue on

1242.419 --> 1247.94
on the level that you were without

1244.94 --> 1251.059
continually bumping back into it because

1247.94 --> 1252.98
you out shouted it created sort of a

1251.059 --> 1256.22
scenario

1252.98 --> 1259.82
and thereby created memory suppressant

1256.22 --> 1262.88
it's like a spray creating a scene is

1259.82 --> 1264.6789999999999
like a memory suppressant spray and this

1262.88 --> 1266.6000000000001
is a natural effect like people don't

1264.679 --> 1270.799
even know that it works like this but it

1266.6 --> 1273.26
does and this is the reason I think that

1270.799 --> 1275.299
people originally had that extreme

1273.26 --> 1278.44
reaction to when you brought it bring up

1275.299 --> 1281.12
911 or you bring up

1278.44 --> 1283.16
uh right

1281.12 --> 1286.58
that

1283.16 --> 1289.28
that the covet measures were were not

1286.58 --> 1291.32
useful you know all of that that the

1289.28 --> 1294.9189999999999
vaccine might not be safe

1291.32 --> 1296.96
it's because they're attempting to

1294.919 --> 1299.539
stay stable on the track of

1296.96 --> 1302.8400000000001
Consciousness that they were on

1299.539 --> 1306.2
which was entailing a lot of active

1302.84 --> 1307.6999999999998
building right it's always busy in the

1306.2 --> 1310.4
Working World you're always busy doing

1307.7 --> 1313.1000000000001
that so changing frequency of

1310.4 --> 1316.3400000000001
Consciousness is extremely disruptive

1313.1 --> 1318.4399999999998
because you're continually required to

1316.34 --> 1320.799
stay stable to keep the building process

1318.44 --> 1320.799
going

1321.62 --> 1329.26
right

1323.02 --> 1329.26
so then the extreme drama responses

1329.539 --> 1333.62
seem like they're over exaggerated to

1331.82 --> 1335.4189999999999
somebody's like but I'm just trying to

1333.62 --> 1337.6999999999998
help you out of it

1335.419 --> 1340.46
yeah but they

1337.7 --> 1344.24
they're too invested they're literally

1340.46 --> 1346.3400000000001
tied into that level of frequency for

1344.24 --> 1348.34
the operations that they're engaging

1346.34 --> 1350.72
with to support their own living

1348.34 --> 1353.12
livelihoods and all that for example

1350.72 --> 1354.559
right or to complete their study for

1353.12 --> 1357.4399999999998
their future career

1354.559 --> 1359.6589999999999
like it all rests on the stability of

1357.44 --> 1363.2
their Consciousness frequency

1359.659 --> 1365.419
because that's how you plan it out

1363.2 --> 1367.3400000000001
but if you then completely change the

1365.419 --> 1370.5200000000002
entire view then you might notice like

1367.34 --> 1371.72
holy [ __ ] education is [ __ ] useless

1370.52 --> 1374.9
really

1371.72 --> 1377.539
that's not the way to really

1374.9 --> 1380.7800000000002
get durable

1377.539 --> 1383.96
tools for professions a lot of the time

1380.78 --> 1386.299
well some studies definitely do

1383.96 --> 1388.58
but

1386.299 --> 1391.6399999999999
like a lot of education is kind of folly

1388.58 --> 1393.799
and and almost everybody that has done

1391.64 --> 1395.24
studies knows that afterward like when

1393.799 --> 1399.1399999999999
they completed it yeah they're very

1395.24 --> 1401.0
proud but then reality sets in and when

1399.14 --> 1403.46
they try things out they start to notice

1401.0 --> 1405.86
like wait yeah all of that [ __ ] was kind

1403.46 --> 1407.659
of completely pointless wasn't it

1405.86 --> 1410.1789999999999
but

1407.659 --> 1413.5390000000002
you didn't see it as such at the time

1410.179 --> 1416.539
you just said saw it as a whole

1413.539 --> 1420.02
right so

1416.539 --> 1423.679
if you get awakened to a higher level

1420.02 --> 1427.76
Insight when you're still engaged in

1423.679 --> 1432.26
building based on the necessity of a

1427.76 --> 1434.9
stable conscious frequency stable level

1432.26 --> 1436.179
then that can give you like a really

1434.9 --> 1440.24
hard

1436.179 --> 1444.679
dark response but that also serves a

1440.24 --> 1447.2
natural function as a memory suppressant

1444.679 --> 1449.96
isn't it fascinating

1447.2 --> 1451.88
yeah I'm very inspired like both Quantum

1449.96 --> 1454.159
of content also movie I watched

1451.88 --> 1457.94
yesterday continued watching it's like a

1454.159 --> 1459.88
murder mystery movie with psychology and

1457.94 --> 1463.3400000000001
it's like there's

1459.88 --> 1466.5800000000002
memory regression hypnosis

1463.34 --> 1470.1789999999999
is very serious like they like it's

1466.58 --> 1472.6399999999999
really part of the story development

1470.179 --> 1475.52
it's very interesting because they

1472.64 --> 1478.039
address the aesthetic mind correcting

1475.52 --> 1481.4
things so they basically address my

1478.039 --> 1483.86
insights about Mandela effect and the

1481.4 --> 1486.98
writer Incorporated it into the murder

1483.86 --> 1490.4599999999998
mystery of the movie which is like

1486.98 --> 1493.1
wow that's really interesting to me

1490.46 --> 1495.3400000000001
right it's a it's a DOT another Dutch

1493.1 --> 1495.34
movie

1495.62 --> 1499.3999999999999
let me see if I

1497.6 --> 1501.26
can find it

1499.4 --> 1504.5
back

1501.26 --> 1506.48
ah crap

1504.5 --> 1509.96
yeah now it would be great if I could

1506.48 --> 1511.22
see that what just finished watching

1509.96 --> 1513.08
list

1511.22 --> 1515.6200000000001
because I don't remember the freaking

1513.08 --> 1515.62
name

1524.059 --> 1532.36
wait I'll just IMDb search on the name

1528.799 --> 1532.36
of what is in there

1538.94 --> 1546.039
oh okay

1542.179 --> 1546.039
ah no no no come on

1546.28 --> 1549.46
[Music]

1550.58 --> 1553.1789999999999
let's see

1571.1 --> 1573.1
um

1577.1 --> 1581.24
it's like you know I I won't be able to

1579.98 --> 1584.2
find it

1581.24 --> 1584.2
this is

1584.72 --> 1590.8600000000001
this is so [ __ ] typical Netflix so

1588.14 --> 1590.8600000000001
[ __ ] typical

1608.96 --> 1612.58
this is ridiculous

1617.72 --> 1623.539
like the only way with Netflix to be

1620.9 --> 1626.919
able to actually remember something is

1623.539 --> 1626.919
to put it in your list

1629.24 --> 1633.559
there's no

1631.24 --> 1636.5
voted list

1633.559 --> 1639.94
there's no oh this is what you recently

1636.5 --> 1639.94
watched list like

1639.98 --> 1647.26
I I really gotta say at this point how

1643.1 --> 1647.26
incredibly unprofessional of them

1647.659 --> 1653.5390000000002
there's like every social media in the

1650.48 --> 1657.5
world has those types of list search

1653.539 --> 1660.5
functions every social but Netflix

1657.5 --> 1660.5
doesn't

1661.279 --> 1665.24
once you saw something if you didn't put

1663.74 --> 1668.24
it in the list and you completely

1665.24 --> 1670.94
finished watching it

1668.24 --> 1673.159
if you don't actively restart the movie

1670.94 --> 1674.539
and watch a little bit at the beginning

1673.159 --> 1677.779
again

1674.539 --> 1680.12
it'll disappear

1677.779 --> 1682.279
from your scope entirely because if you

1680.12 --> 1686.2399999999998
watch a little bit of it again

1682.279 --> 1688.279
then it will actually be very much there

1686.24 --> 1690.799
in the list to be able to find it back

1688.279 --> 1693.08
of continue watching which is a list

1690.799 --> 1697.1
that's always there but once you've

1693.08 --> 1699.86
finished it it disappears forever

1697.1 --> 1701.32
you never find it back

1699.86 --> 1706.1789999999999
how

1701.32 --> 1706.1789999999999
unbelievably unprofessional of Netflix

1706.82 --> 1711.98
because now this time I completely

1709.46 --> 1713.48
forgot the name of the movie I don't

1711.98 --> 1716.24
know where to start

1713.48 --> 1721.1
with the name of it

1716.24 --> 1724.1
oh derp alert computer hard oh really

1721.1 --> 1727.3999999999999
no it's not computers it's about

1724.1 --> 1731.299
the browser interface it's the software

1727.4 --> 1733.779
that that they make you use to browse

1731.299 --> 1733.779
their movies

1736.22 --> 1743.059
and Netflix has a web page title

1740.539 --> 1744.559
how to see View viewing history and

1743.059 --> 1748.12
device activity

1744.559 --> 1748.12
okay that's cute

1763.419 --> 1768.22
parental control viewing activity

1768.799 --> 1775.059
right but it's not just a search list

1771.14 --> 1775.0590000000002
why is it not a search list

1777.4 --> 1780.539
[Music]

1786.52 --> 1791.98
it says in account

1789.38 --> 1791.98
no

1794.48 --> 1797.48
profile

1807.98 --> 1810.58
now

1811.159 --> 1813.7
this

1818.44 --> 1825.919
dude what the [ __ ]

1822.2 --> 1829.059
the page just unmute it

1825.919 --> 1833.2990000000002
I had it muted all this time and it just

1829.059 --> 1836.1399999999999
it just unmuted out of nothing

1833.299 --> 1839.799
what the [ __ ]

1836.14 --> 1839.7990000000002
seriously what the [ __ ]

1841.039 --> 1843.52
okay

1845.74 --> 1853.1
view activity cool I found it ah

1850.94 --> 1855.679
wow that's really convoluted by the way

1853.1 --> 1856.8799999999999
but thank you for telling me that there

1855.679 --> 1859.52
is a way

1856.88 --> 1863.1200000000001
but you have to like go into like the

1859.52 --> 1865.76
database like why isn't this just like a

1863.12 --> 1868.82
standard list you can search it's really

1865.76 --> 1871.46
unprofessional I'm I'm sticking that it

1868.82 --> 1873.08
is really unprofessional

1871.46 --> 1876.44
right anyway

1873.08 --> 1880.34
the movie and it's it's a Dutch movie

1876.44 --> 1882.0800000000002
it's called the memory game

1880.34 --> 1885.4599999999998
and I thought it was really interesting

1882.08 --> 1888.1399999999999
it was like a bit

1885.46 --> 1889.94
artificial it seemed I could feel like

1888.14 --> 1891.26
it was a little bit artificial with the

1889.94 --> 1892.8200000000002
communication

1891.26 --> 1894.919
but still

1892.82 --> 1897.8799999999999
like how it was written

1894.919 --> 1901.22
but it was overall very interesting

1897.88 --> 1903.64
because it was literally about memory

1901.22 --> 1906.98
and how it works and like this woman

1903.64 --> 1908.779
basically is trying to recover like

1906.98 --> 1912.679
memories from

1908.779 --> 1914.72
two decades ago it's very funny in a way

1912.679 --> 1917.0590000000002
because I feel personally a lot of

1914.72 --> 1918.559
similarities like I am

1917.059 --> 1920.779
yeah

1918.559 --> 1925.4189999999999
a lot of [ __ ] has happened in my past

1920.779 --> 1925.419
too and I've noticed that like

1925.46 --> 1931.76
that memories are weird like I have much

1928.58 --> 1934.22
I bet mostly just Dark World Vision

1931.76 --> 1939.08
memories from that time

1934.22 --> 1940.64
and relatively sparing actual real world

1939.08 --> 1943.58
memories

1940.64 --> 1948.26
but it makes sense because in real world

1943.58 --> 1951.02
situation I was feeling really bad a lot

1948.26 --> 1952.76
like I felt doomed and that kind of

1951.02 --> 1955.039
thing

1952.76 --> 1958.039
like at any moment just the ground would

1955.039 --> 1961.82
open up and I would fall into hell like

1958.039 --> 1964.8799999999999
that kind of feeling and that sort of

1961.82 --> 1966.9189999999999
feeling really ruins

1964.88 --> 1969.5590000000002
like well it starts to interfere with

1966.919 --> 1971.8400000000001
your memory that's liked it that's

1969.559 --> 1973.279
afterward because I didn't even notice

1971.84 --> 1974.9599999999998
that while it was happening but

1973.279 --> 1977.419
afterward it will

1974.96 --> 1980.179
and if it gets worse well then you even

1977.419 --> 1983.2990000000002
start to hallucinate and [ __ ] resulting

1980.179 --> 1985.88
in like massive dark world scenarios

1983.299 --> 1987.559
that will then stick to the memory to

1985.88 --> 1990.46
override everything and that's I think

1987.559 --> 1990.46
what happened with me

1992.779 --> 1998.179
the bizarre thing is though that the

1995.179 --> 2001.1200000000001
Dark World Visions themselves had

1998.179 --> 2003.779
coherence like they were their own story

2001.12 --> 2007.779
and they had elements from the future

2003.779 --> 2010.24
and even as I earlier realized that like

2007.779 --> 2013.24
I can't get a grip on it it's like I

2010.24 --> 2016.84
know I've seen things that are coming

2013.24 --> 2018.88
I just can't consciously get a grip on I

2016.84 --> 2020.799
can feel that it's there I just can't

2018.88 --> 2023.7990000000002
get a grip on it it

2020.799 --> 2027.539
it's a Cassandra effect I can't get a

2023.799 --> 2027.539
grip on it but I know they're there

2030.399 --> 2036.1
and I've been able to sparingly mention

2032.86 --> 2038.74
a few things that really are like

2036.1 --> 2042.36
Targets in the future like big scenarios

2038.74 --> 2042.36
that are gonna take place

2042.539 --> 2046.2
within my lifetime

2046.36 --> 2050.6189999999997
big stuff

2048.04 --> 2053.08
and a lot of big stuff has happened it

2050.619 --> 2057.28
hasn't happened right here where I live

2053.08 --> 2059.3199999999997
but through my engagement with the world

2057.28 --> 2061.78
through media

2059.32 --> 2064.659
it has connected the world up to me and

2061.78 --> 2067.7200000000003
therefore I have seen things

2064.659 --> 2068.9190000000003
of the world that I felt were very close

2067.72 --> 2071.399
to me

2068.919 --> 2076.54
even though in reality I've probably

2071.399 --> 2079.359
mostly it has gotten to me through media

2076.54 --> 2082.06
and that's how I

2079.359 --> 2084.2799999999997
like that's the sourcing

2082.06 --> 2087.7599999999998
for the Dark World Vision

2084.28 --> 2090.179
is what I am picking up during my

2087.76 --> 2090.179
lifetime

2090.22 --> 2095.379
watching media

2092.26 --> 2096.7000000000003
a lot of it and talking to people also

2095.379 --> 2098.5
for psychological studies but

2096.7 --> 2101.5
psychological studies are have always

2098.5 --> 2104.02
been my personal activity based thing

2101.5 --> 2107.5
never like the dark world was never

2104.02 --> 2109.72
[ __ ] with me with it like I had power

2107.5 --> 2111.94
within the Dark World

2109.72 --> 2115.72
with psychology

2111.94 --> 2120.42
like even over the demons I learned to

2115.72 --> 2120.4199999999996
control them through psychology

2121.3 --> 2124.32
it's weird

2124.72 --> 2129.2799999999997
but my psychology has always been my

2127.24 --> 2131.68
thing

2129.28 --> 2134.8590000000004
and never a thing that was like put on

2131.68 --> 2138.16
me by the Dark World or like oh you're

2134.859 --> 2141.54
evil because of this or that or no

2138.16 --> 2141.54
it's always been my tool

2143.2 --> 2147.8799999999997
anyway I hope you guys could follow that

2145.9 --> 2150.2400000000002
a bit

2147.88 --> 2153.599
it was getting kind of a

2150.24 --> 2153.5989999999997
esoteric and

2154.3 --> 2159.46
time transcended

2156.46 --> 2161.76
and that might confuse you it confuses

2159.46 --> 2161.76
me

2162.7 --> 2168.3999999999996
it makes it harder to follow probably

2166.48 --> 2170.26
right so let's see if there's any

2168.4 --> 2172.54
feedback

2170.26 --> 2174.78
or you guys are still talking about your

2172.54 --> 2174.7799999999997
games

2177.04 --> 2180.22
at some memories after realizing an

2179.14 --> 2181.54
innovative

2180.22 --> 2183.339
yeah

2181.54 --> 2186.339
yeah then and then the associated

2183.339 --> 2188.859
memories will start coming back to you

2186.339 --> 2191.859
because that's the thing memories

2188.859 --> 2194.619
resonate with frequencies

2191.859 --> 2196.48
memories resonate with Associated

2194.619 --> 2199.48
frequencies

2196.48 --> 2202.54
so if you have a bad moment with

2199.48 --> 2205.06
somebody then the way that bad moment is

2202.54 --> 2207.3
and it makes you feel

2205.06 --> 2211.06
like other

2207.3 --> 2214.619
events and memories that happen during

2211.06 --> 2217.599
exactly that frequency of experience

2214.619 --> 2220.32
will come back to you you will start to

2217.599 --> 2220.32
it's like

2221.44 --> 2227.98
let's just say you're yeah don't you're

2226.24 --> 2229.7799999999997
a girl and you really like hang around

2227.98 --> 2231.04
with men and you're always like they're

2229.78 --> 2233.2000000000003
the best

2231.04 --> 2237.4
and then it goes wrong

2233.2 --> 2239.98
and then suddenly you remember like wait

2237.4 --> 2241.78
it went wrong a lot I've had a lot of

2239.98 --> 2243.579
men that did this they're actually

2241.78 --> 2246.6400000000003
bastards

2243.579 --> 2248.8
and then it's like uh you get rid of it

2246.64 --> 2250.359
you get out of it and then you kind of

2248.8 --> 2252.82
forget about it again and it's like oh

2250.359 --> 2254.619
wow I love men and then you're gonna go

2252.82 --> 2256.96
around and then it goes wrong again and

2254.619 --> 2260.5
then suddenly he's like wait what

2256.96 --> 2262.18
I remember this no wait it it always

2260.5 --> 2265.06
goes wrong

2262.18 --> 2266.74
but you just forget about that after you

2265.06 --> 2269.44
cut it off

2266.74 --> 2271.4199999999996
because then the frequencies that bring

2269.44 --> 2273.7000000000003
back those memories those bad memories

2271.42 --> 2275.619
the frequency goes away again because

2273.7 --> 2278.0789999999997
you climb out of it and so you don't

2275.619 --> 2281.26
remember how bad it is and then that

2278.079 --> 2284.1400000000003
gives room again for the impulses that

2281.26 --> 2285.6400000000003
draw you into it

2284.14 --> 2289.1189999999997
yeah

2285.64 --> 2291.52
and that type of cycle is typically a

2289.119 --> 2293.26
person that it becomes like slaves to

2291.52 --> 2295.06
their impulses

2293.26 --> 2297.76
to their feelings

2295.06 --> 2301.24
because their memories

2297.76 --> 2304.0600000000004
are become distorted by their feelings

2301.24 --> 2306.2799999999997
right and that effect is different per

2304.06 --> 2308.56
person like some people that are

2306.28 --> 2310.5400000000004
typically very emotional

2308.56 --> 2312.339
have that a lot

2310.54 --> 2314.02
compared to people that are not so

2312.339 --> 2316.0
emotional they have tend to have a much

2314.02 --> 2319.14
more stable memory because of it because

2316.0 --> 2321.4
the emotions do effectively

2319.14 --> 2324.04
compartmentalize your memory system

2321.4 --> 2326.94
because of the effect that I described

2324.04 --> 2326.94
before this you see

2327.28 --> 2332.98
so that's just how it works I have a

2330.52 --> 2335.74
compartmentalized memory system

2332.98 --> 2338.38
because I'm very emotional

2335.74 --> 2341.2
however

2338.38 --> 2343.2400000000002
I've learned to use the

2341.2 --> 2347.3199999999997
compartmentalization

2343.24 --> 2349.4799999999996
to protect myself and to guard dark

2347.32 --> 2352.3590000000004
secrets

2349.48 --> 2356.38
to actually guard them to not have them

2352.359 --> 2359.38
ruin my life and influence them me

2356.38 --> 2362.8
but to keep them away from me it's like

2359.38 --> 2365.2000000000003
I know things that I run from and the

2362.8 --> 2366.94
Curiosity that originally pulled me

2365.2 --> 2370.7999999999997
towards them

2366.94 --> 2373.66
has been like permanently

2370.8 --> 2376.1800000000003
influenced like it can't

2373.66 --> 2379.68
go back to naive again

2376.18 --> 2384.8799999999997
it's like even though I don't know

2379.68 --> 2387.46
what I know that caused me to realize

2384.88 --> 2389.56
it's bad

2387.46 --> 2393.7
I still feel

2389.56 --> 2395.74
enough of that sense to not be pulled

2393.7 --> 2397.54
into curiosity of trying to figure it

2395.74 --> 2398.9799999999996
out again because that happened a few

2397.54 --> 2401.44
times you see

2398.98 --> 2403.599
dark [ __ ] and I'd forget about it again

2401.44 --> 2406.0
because it's so [ __ ] up and then it

2403.599 --> 2408.46
just get Curious by the same type of

2406.0 --> 2413.02
thing again it's like what is this

2408.46 --> 2416.92
it really feels like Amnesia like that

2413.02 --> 2420.52
well I've gathered enough misery

2416.92 --> 2424.359
to finally stop the Curiosity that leads

2420.52 --> 2426.7
me on on its Trail on the trail to evil

2424.359 --> 2428.859
like I've learned enough about it to not

2426.7 --> 2430.66
be lured back in there again by accident

2428.859 --> 2432.46
through my

2430.66 --> 2435.359
through my instincts

2432.46 --> 2435.359
and intuition

2435.94 --> 2441.2200000000003
right because I'm not gonna be there I'm

2439.06 --> 2443.7999999999997
not gonna stay on that frequency and

2441.22 --> 2446.3999999999996
actively know all that [ __ ] up [ __ ]

2443.8 --> 2446.4
continually

2447.04 --> 2452.38
because it will ruin everything or ruin

2449.26 --> 2455.82
me like it ruined me as I would be

2452.38 --> 2455.82
consciously dealing with it

2457.48 --> 2463.18
but at least

2459.76 --> 2466.2400000000002
I know enough of it to not let it

2463.18 --> 2467.44
influence me but still be guarded to not

2466.24 --> 2471.3999999999996
be

2467.44 --> 2473.98
seduced in maneuvering myself back there

2471.4 --> 2476.7400000000002
because I'm curious

2473.98 --> 2478.78
like my curiosity has been satiated even

2476.74 --> 2481.4799999999996
though I don't consciously actively

2478.78 --> 2484.48
remember those things

2481.48 --> 2486.339
I know they're there I just I don't want

2484.48 --> 2490.0
their they shouldn't be remembered I

2486.339 --> 2492.4
know things that are just that

2490.0 --> 2495.339
like that's just dangerous knowledge

2492.4 --> 2498.4
like I've learned to understand things

2495.339 --> 2500.2599999999998
in a very dangerous way too because that

2498.4 --> 2502.359
like I've learned to understand things

2500.26 --> 2504.28
like how a psychopath understand things

2502.359 --> 2505.839
it's like the one thing that I kind of

2504.28 --> 2509.92
like

2505.839 --> 2511.9
learned dealing with him and adapting to

2509.92 --> 2514.1800000000003
them to their way of doing things like

2511.9 --> 2517.0
adapted suppressing my own feelings

2514.18 --> 2518.6189999999997
actively to not be faced by really

2517.0 --> 2519.94
[ __ ] up [ __ ]

2518.619 --> 2522.2200000000003
but

2519.94 --> 2524.98
it worked but it couldn't stay that way

2522.22 --> 2528.2799999999997
because I'm not actually a psychopath

2524.98 --> 2529.2400000000002
psychopath it really just it like they

2528.28 --> 2531.46
don't

2529.24 --> 2533.02
they get like this feeling of Wonder

2531.46 --> 2535.42
like

2533.02 --> 2537.94
there's something there but I don't know

2535.42 --> 2539.2000000000003
what it is I know yeah I'm just gonna

2537.94 --> 2542.079
forget about it

2539.2 --> 2543.16
well for me it would be like

2542.079 --> 2546.04
it's there

2543.16 --> 2548.7999999999997
it's locked in it's safe it's not gonna

2546.04 --> 2551.68
get to me right now but if more of that

2548.8 --> 2554.2000000000003
builds up it's like a a lightning rod

2551.68 --> 2555.3999999999996
and eventually if the tension builds up

2554.2 --> 2556.839
enough

2555.4 --> 2560.859
like

2556.839 --> 2564.099
the ark will get to me to me locking my

2560.859 --> 2565.5989999999997
heart off from it to protect myself to

2564.099 --> 2568.48
stay to keep going

2565.599 --> 2571.3
and then it would zap me and completely

2568.48 --> 2574.119
devastate my inner world

2571.3 --> 2577.1800000000003
so it was a very [ __ ] risky process

2574.119 --> 2580.119
to do that and I'm very lucky to get out

2577.18 --> 2583.48
relatively unscathed like at least I

2580.119 --> 2585.28
wasn't completely innerly destroyed

2583.48 --> 2587.859
that could have happened

2585.28 --> 2591.46
it would have happened if I actually

2587.859 --> 2594.52
stayed on the course of my Exploration

2591.46 --> 2598.9
with it then I would have probably been

2594.52 --> 2600.099
come completely deranged inside like now

2598.9 --> 2603.2200000000003
I have

2600.099 --> 2605.44
anger extremities right

2603.22 --> 2609.7
that's the peak that's the that's the

2605.44 --> 2613.42
worst that happened well it can go much

2609.7 --> 2617.02
worse and I'm not like and no but just

2613.42 --> 2621.599
like no instead of rap burning it off in

2617.02 --> 2626.98
expression it instead just could be like

2621.599 --> 2629.079
[ __ ] dark and actually doing dark

2626.98 --> 2631.9
that's what happens when you can get

2629.079 --> 2634.54
completely destroyed on the inside

2631.9 --> 2637.42
and I was man like I went through the

2634.54 --> 2639.52
darkness and I was just I barely managed

2637.42 --> 2641.579
to prevent myself from becoming a

2639.52 --> 2645.4
deranged

2641.579 --> 2647.8
Maniac that actually hurts people and

2645.4 --> 2650.339
who knows what else

2647.8 --> 2650.3390000000004
God

2650.56 --> 2655.48
it was so [ __ ] dangerous it was very

2653.2 --> 2659.319
fascinating to do it though

2655.48 --> 2661.119
because I knew the risks it's just the

2659.319 --> 2663.099
biggest problem is that I didn't really

2661.119 --> 2665.38
have a plan

2663.099 --> 2667.839
I kind of

2665.38 --> 2671.38
left it in God's hands

2667.839 --> 2674.64
and in a way like I also trusted God to

2671.38 --> 2677.319
protect me within my sort of

2674.64 --> 2680.02
self-reinforced naivety because I was

2677.319 --> 2683.14
aware of that like I knew it was [ __ ]

2680.02 --> 2686.14
evil and I didn't want that but I wanted

2683.14 --> 2689.74
to understand it

2686.14 --> 2691.42
and like it was the only opportunity to

2689.74 --> 2694.0789999999997
have like

2691.42 --> 2698.5
first hand

2694.079 --> 2702.52
sensory experience of people that trust

2698.5 --> 2706.06
me while they're in it it was the only

2702.52 --> 2708.04
[ __ ] chance I had in my life

2706.06 --> 2712.02
and I took it

2708.04 --> 2712.02
and it had a big price still

2712.24 --> 2717.339
because yeah when you get to know evil I

2715.42 --> 2719.28
mean literally the Bible warns about it

2717.339 --> 2723.839
right knowledge of Good and Evil

2719.28 --> 2725.98
knowledge of evil [ __ ] you up

2723.839 --> 2728.14
thank you

2725.98 --> 2731.52
and

2728.14 --> 2736.7799999999997
you don't realize that until you get it

2731.52 --> 2741.94
but knowing about how evil works is not

2736.78 --> 2743.7000000000003
as useful to protect you against evil

2741.94 --> 2747.04
as it is

2743.7 --> 2750.06
influencing you negatively

2747.04 --> 2753.46
and that's a lesson that I've learned

2750.06 --> 2756.72
firsthand I can tell you about it like

2753.46 --> 2761.28
yes it's actually true

2756.72 --> 2761.2799999999997
it's practically true

2763.24 --> 2768.2799999999997
and the only real reason that I don't

2765.579 --> 2771.04
regret having done that is because now I

2768.28 --> 2773.619
can really be capable of telling you

2771.04 --> 2775.839
first-hand experience like yes it really

2773.619 --> 2780.099
is like that

2775.839 --> 2784.0
that's the advantage I have out of it

2780.099 --> 2786.28
which I inflate enormously to to not see

2784.0 --> 2788.92
all the scars that I'm kind of like

2786.28 --> 2791.38
forgetting about

2788.92 --> 2793.44
right because I'm trying to look at it

2791.38 --> 2797.6800000000003
positive I've gone through hell well

2793.44 --> 2800.339
yeah you're [ __ ] forever but at least

2797.68 --> 2800.339
I can

2801.339 --> 2807.099
help Avail maybe young people's

2804.64 --> 2811.18
Curiosities that had the same curiosity

2807.099 --> 2813.1600000000003
issues as I have and risk getting in

2811.18 --> 2815.56
stuck in the darkness because of that

2813.16 --> 2819.04
and now I can like tell them from first

2815.56 --> 2821.319
hand experience like no it is really not

2819.04 --> 2824.74
worth it

2821.319 --> 2828.46
I've done it I know I can I I'm lucky

2824.74 --> 2832.24
enough to be able to tell you about it

2828.46 --> 2834.099
and not be evil and then still get you

2832.24 --> 2835.7799999999997
get caught in it because if you're

2834.099 --> 2839.8590000000004
really evil and you're on the other side

2835.78 --> 2841.9
like if you completely corrupted then

2839.859 --> 2843.5789999999997
you might tell somebody about it

2841.9 --> 2846.1600000000003
but then

2843.579 --> 2847.96
whether you consciously knew that when

2846.16 --> 2850.839
you were telling them about it the dark

2847.96 --> 2853.96
side of you will then pull them in with

2850.839 --> 2857.56
you that's what the darkness does it's

2853.96 --> 2859.96
out of the conscious person's control

2857.56 --> 2862.18
and that's the biggest problem with evil

2859.96 --> 2865.2400000000002
in general is that the darkness within

2862.18 --> 2868.48
them takes control over them it's like

2865.24 --> 2871.5989999999997
their subconscious which is evil then

2868.48 --> 2874.599
it doesn't care about the the

2871.599 --> 2877.7200000000003
durability of the world of suffering all

2874.599 --> 2880.7200000000003
that it will take priority over your

2877.72 --> 2883.54
conscience so it will like

2880.72 --> 2885.8799999999997
it will take away your grip over your

2883.54 --> 2889.9
own decision making that's what true

2885.88 --> 2892.1800000000003
evil corruption does it takes away your

2889.9 --> 2895.9
decision making

2892.18 --> 2899.3999999999996
and if you realize that then the model

2895.9 --> 2903.579
of being possessed by the devil

2899.4 --> 2907.42
is really very logical

2903.579 --> 2909.2200000000003
because actively you don't have control

2907.42 --> 2912.4
over your own decision making it

2909.22 --> 2917.5
something else is doing that through you

2912.4 --> 2921.94
from the inside the darkness the devil

2917.5 --> 2924.819
that took more room in you contracted

2921.94 --> 2926.319
you out of conscious grip over your own

2924.819 --> 2931.0
decision making

2926.319 --> 2934.38
the devil from the inside takes grip

2931.0 --> 2934.38
over your actions

2936.099 --> 2940.3
it is the darkness itself that is acting

2939.04 --> 2941.98
through you

2940.3 --> 2945.76
because you

2941.98 --> 2949.359
let it fester in you you let it take up

2945.76 --> 2951.46
room and then let it take over your

2949.359 --> 2953.68
decision making you were seduced in

2951.46 --> 2955.78
giving it power because there were

2953.68 --> 2958.0
advantages and there are advantages but

2955.78 --> 2960.76
it doesn't tell you how much it takes

2958.0 --> 2962.74
away from your entire existence your

2960.76 --> 2965.619
entire experience

2962.74 --> 2967.66
doesn't tell you that price you're just

2965.619 --> 2970.119
gonna have to find out by being stupid

2967.66 --> 2973.06
enough to take the deal

2970.119 --> 2976.7200000000003
from within yeah the deal with the devil

2973.06 --> 2979.599
isn't with a person on the outside with

2976.72 --> 2984.04
some Rothschild or Rockefeller stooge

2979.599 --> 2987.6400000000003
drawing a contract no the real one is

2984.04 --> 2991.359
inside it happens in you and potentially

2987.64 --> 2994.2999999999997
in your dreams yeah seduction by the

2991.359 --> 2999.64
devil to relinquish control over your

2994.3 --> 3005.54
actions happens in your dreams

2999.64 --> 3009.54
and in response usually to a a a a

3005.54 --> 3012.18
curiosity of evil on the in the outside

3009.54 --> 3014.2799999999997
world so you would have experienced like

3012.18 --> 3016.9199999999996
oh this person's kind of [ __ ] evil

3014.28 --> 3019.5
I'm curious about that and I'm not

3016.92 --> 3022.14
repulsed I'm curious about that and I'm

3019.5 --> 3024.66
gonna like go for it and maybe ask them

3022.14 --> 3025.98
like interviewer like an interview with

3024.66 --> 3027.72
a vampire

3025.98 --> 3030.9
an evil one

3027.72 --> 3033.18
well that's not gonna contract you with

3030.9 --> 3036.0
the devil but what it will do is

3033.18 --> 3039.359
probably give you dreams in which the

3036.0 --> 3042.3
devil will try to come to you and try to

3039.359 --> 3044.4
make you sign over control over your

3042.3 --> 3047.94
decision making

3044.4 --> 3051.42
that will happen in response to

3047.94 --> 3054.059
curiosity to evil I know I for

3051.42 --> 3056.48
personally experienced that quite a few

3054.059 --> 3056.48
times

3057.78 --> 3062.78
right so I managed to actually do it

3070.26 --> 3074.0
so that's yeah

3087.61 --> 3090.6690000000003
[Music]

3094.31 --> 3102.0099999999998
[Music]

3105.3 --> 3111.119
wow yeah well that set the tone for

3108.18 --> 3113.7
today's show okay my temporary title how

3111.119 --> 3117.42
possession by

3113.7 --> 3119.7799999999997
and con contracts with the devil really

3117.42 --> 3119.78
work

3120.72 --> 3124.16
and we can do this

3125.7 --> 3128.2999999999997
right

3131.099 --> 3137.9
for me this stuff is very relevant in my

3133.74 --> 3137.8999999999996
life yeah it is with most most of us

3138.059 --> 3144.5400000000004
it's probably what draw you guys to me

3142.079 --> 3146.52
in a way because you feel like this the

3144.54 --> 3148.68
the thing that I just described is

3146.52 --> 3151.04
something you could probably feel about

3148.68 --> 3151.04
me

3151.079 --> 3159.3590000000004
like I I did go there did

3155.64 --> 3164.0589999999997
I was seduced by the dark side

3159.359 --> 3164.0589999999997
I tried to pull a Darth Vader

3164.339 --> 3169.2
but I basically

3166.859 --> 3173.24
broke roll

3169.2 --> 3173.24
like I I couldn't do it

3173.339 --> 3176.9
it was hurting me too much

3177.0 --> 3180.68
like with protections and everything

3184.14 --> 3188.0989999999997
like I thought that I could get used to

3186.72 --> 3191.4199999999996
evil

3188.099 --> 3194.6400000000003
I thought that accepting evil existing

3191.42 --> 3197.2200000000003
would be getting used to it

3194.64 --> 3200.819
I was wrong

3197.22 --> 3204.18
and it has resulted in me becoming kind

3200.819 --> 3206.72
of extremely allergic to it instead

3204.18 --> 3209.2799999999997
yeah I thought that I could accept

3206.72 --> 3210.839
gayness and and that it's like oh it

3209.28 --> 3213.0
doesn't really matter

3210.839 --> 3215.22
yeah and look at me now I'm freaking

3213.0 --> 3218.42
homophobic

3215.22 --> 3218.4199999999996
like it didn't work

3219.66 --> 3223.92
and I thought that I could just like

3222.0 --> 3226.619
yeah I'll just

3223.92 --> 3230.4
accept that there's just Eugenics and

3226.619 --> 3234.2400000000002
that they're just calling the herd

3230.4 --> 3237.839
well to a certain degree I can accept it

3234.24 --> 3240.2999999999997
but the damage that's being done outside

3237.839 --> 3243.42
like they're reaching outside of their

3240.3 --> 3247.5
function I mean when Eugenics leads you

3243.42 --> 3249.3
to add to like poison the land

3247.5 --> 3251.4
and create

3249.3 --> 3253.7400000000002
Rubble

3251.4 --> 3257.28
and all that

3253.74 --> 3259.9799999999996
then you've like violated the very

3257.28 --> 3262.26
reason for eugenics to exist in the

3259.98 --> 3264.599
first instance

3262.26 --> 3266.94
right there's no more sense to it

3264.599 --> 3269.1800000000003
there's no more control if you're just

3266.94 --> 3272.46
destroying everything

3269.18 --> 3275.04
to down the numbers well then well

3272.46 --> 3278.46
you're creating Rubble then

3275.04 --> 3282.66
you're creating rubble and toxic [ __ ]

3278.46 --> 3285.48
like the original Eugenics was a logical

3282.66 --> 3290.0989999999997
framework of thinking that was designed

3285.48 --> 3290.099
to guarantee survival

3291.18 --> 3299.52
yeah not Ultimate Death

3294.54 --> 3302.4
it was there to guarantee survival it

3299.52 --> 3305.52
was a logical framework how to guarantee

3302.4 --> 3308.48
survival like how do you deal with

3305.52 --> 3312.66
psychologically tormenting situations

3308.48 --> 3314.64
and ensure that sir that that enough of

3312.66 --> 3317.2799999999997
you survive to

3314.64 --> 3319.7999999999997
continue on

3317.28 --> 3321.7200000000003
even if that includes murdering somebody

3319.8 --> 3323.46
that you liked or whatever just because

3321.72 --> 3326.04
you needed to eat that sort of [ __ ]

3323.46 --> 3329.94
right the [ __ ] up [ __ ] it was like a

3326.04 --> 3332.16
protocol a framework how to guarantee

3329.94 --> 3335.4
survival through logic

3332.16 --> 3337.5589999999997
and self-control yeah that's the

3335.4 --> 3341.04
original Eugenics and look at what these

3337.559 --> 3343.02
disgusting demons have done with it look

3341.04 --> 3346.5
at what they've done

3343.02 --> 3349.14
they use the logic and just turn it into

3346.5 --> 3351.98
an annihilation

3349.14 --> 3351.98
protocol

3352.14 --> 3356.52
they ruined the entire original Spirit

3355.079 --> 3358.38
behind it

3356.52 --> 3360.0
which was

3358.38 --> 3363.7200000000003
a spirit

3360.0 --> 3363.72
of survival

3364.079 --> 3368.76
and they turn it into a spirit of

3366.119 --> 3372.48
annihilation so it's like the Marxist

3368.76 --> 3375.1800000000003
corruption Eugenics has been corrupted

3372.48 --> 3377.46
by Marxism

3375.18 --> 3379.859
what what we're seeing now isn't even

3377.46 --> 3381.359
the original Eugenics it's Marxist

3379.859 --> 3385.7999999999997
eugenics

3381.359 --> 3389.16
it's the opposite of what it should be

3385.8 --> 3391.92
it's not to guarantee survival it is to

3389.16 --> 3395.24
guarantee Annihilation the application

3391.92 --> 3397.8
of this Eugenics guarantees Annihilation

3395.24 --> 3400.9199999999996
not survival

3397.8 --> 3402.9
there isn't even

3400.92 --> 3405.8
like

3402.9 --> 3410.2200000000003
they don't even aim at an outcome

3405.8 --> 3412.5
Eugenics should always be a mathematical

3410.22 --> 3415.7
equation you see

3412.5 --> 3419.579
what you have now what's gonna happen

3415.7 --> 3424.7
what you have afterward

3419.579 --> 3424.7000000000003
this Eugenics there is no what afterward

3424.92 --> 3429.7200000000003
it is it's not even there there's not

3426.96 --> 3432.66
even a calculation they don't even aim

3429.72 --> 3435.66
to like oh this is exactly what we're

3432.66 --> 3438.7799999999997
gonna have oh what really the oh less

3435.66 --> 3441.72
than 500 million

3438.78 --> 3443.2200000000003
Eugenics promise right in what kind of

3441.72 --> 3446.4599999999996
world

3443.22 --> 3448.9199999999996
would that survive if you cut down the

3446.46 --> 3452.339
population that much and create that

3448.92 --> 3454.079
much Rubble and and pollution everywhere

3452.339 --> 3455.7
in the process

3454.079 --> 3458.94
what you think that's going to be

3455.7 --> 3462.4199999999996
durable no it's just going to be

3458.94 --> 3464.16
much less people that have been damaged

3462.42 --> 3467.2200000000003
all over the place genetically they're

3464.16 --> 3468.48
barely able to survive in a lot of waste

3467.22 --> 3472.5589999999997
and Rubble

3468.48 --> 3474.599
just barely holding on how the [ __ ] is

3472.559 --> 3479.0400000000004
that eugenics

3474.599 --> 3482.28
it's a it's Annihilation it's not there

3479.04 --> 3484.68
to guarantee survival

3482.28 --> 3486.9
which is the original Spirit behind

3484.68 --> 3489.3799999999997
geogenics it's a protocol to guarantee

3486.9 --> 3489.38
survival

3490.14 --> 3493.7
look what they've done to it

3494.4 --> 3498.42
and I feel really weird feeling like how

3497.339 --> 3502.38
dare you

3498.42 --> 3504.3
go after my Eugenics will Marxist but

3502.38 --> 3506.76
that is effectively sort of what is

3504.3 --> 3510.1800000000003
happening like I learned the principles

3506.76 --> 3513.1800000000003
of eugenics like when I was 12.

3510.18 --> 3513.18
non-malignantly

3517.619 --> 3521.339
and I thought like yeah that makes a lot

3519.54 --> 3524.52
of sense

3521.339 --> 3527.099
like things could potentially go to all

3524.52 --> 3529.14
hell how do you guarantee Survival how

3527.099 --> 3532.8590000000004
do you make sure you're still a people

3529.14 --> 3535.2
for example after that right let's just

3532.859 --> 3537.42
say your your country certainly gets a

3535.2 --> 3540.1189999999997
gigantic disaster or like a hostile

3537.42 --> 3542.2400000000002
Invasion and they're like genociding

3540.119 --> 3545.1600000000003
it's all [ __ ] sure

3542.24 --> 3548.5789999999997
how do you guarantee survival

3545.16 --> 3550.5589999999997
how do you guarantee your genetic groups

3548.579 --> 3552.9
the ones you need how do you guarantee

3550.559 --> 3555.559
the mindset right it's all about

3552.9 --> 3555.559
survival

3555.839 --> 3561.119
like breeding programs potentially or

3559.5 --> 3563.64
tactics

3561.119 --> 3565.819
like how do you ensure the most

3563.64 --> 3569.66
important

3565.819 --> 3574.4
aspects that are required for future

3569.66 --> 3574.3999999999996
are protected and maintained

3574.5 --> 3578.94
that's not this Eugenics what we're

3576.78 --> 3581.28
dealing with is not Eugenics it's also

3578.94 --> 3584.52
been called dysgenics and I think that I

3581.28 --> 3588.6800000000003
think it the name is that catchy but it

3584.52 --> 3588.68
is effective it is what it is

3589.68 --> 3593.3999999999996
the Eugenics that we're dealing with

3591.54 --> 3595.98
isn't

3593.4 --> 3597.78
to guarantee survival it's to guarantee

3595.98 --> 3602.04
annihilation

3597.78 --> 3604.6800000000003
and we can literally palpably see that

3602.04 --> 3606.0
about it if you look carefully if you

3604.68 --> 3607.5589999999997
look at what's happening look what

3606.0 --> 3610.98
they're doing look at what the results

3607.559 --> 3614.3590000000004
are look at what the policy changes do

3610.98 --> 3617.72
yeah it's just more and more and more

3614.359 --> 3622.44
problems burdens taxes

3617.72 --> 3626.24
disasters shortages price hikes more

3622.44 --> 3630.66
more and more that nothing about that

3626.24 --> 3633.0589999999997
leads to survival nothing about it only

3630.66 --> 3636.14
leads to more cataclysm

3633.059 --> 3636.1400000000003
and more chaos

3636.599 --> 3639.1400000000003
right

3642.66 --> 3646.2
hey skeptic936

3653.16 --> 3658.3799999999997
yeah the well said enter the eluthian

3655.74 --> 3661.5
catharsis exactly when Eugenics is

3658.38 --> 3664.6800000000003
unnecessarily cruel and out of spite

3661.5 --> 3666.059
then it corrupts and ruins it the spirit

3664.68 --> 3669.0
of it

3666.059 --> 3672.1800000000003
it ruins its goodness and reason for

3669.0 --> 3674.76
being right because originally Eugenics

3672.18 --> 3678.96
come out of the spirit like

3674.76 --> 3682.6800000000003
like oh my body is

3678.96 --> 3684.66
like but is it let's give a very simple

3682.68 --> 3687.8999999999996
movie accent what would be Eugenics

3684.66 --> 3691.74
Eugenics would be your body that you

3687.9 --> 3693.2400000000002
really like you your your best butts but

3691.74 --> 3694.9199999999996
he got bit by a zombie he's going to

3693.24 --> 3697.2
turn into a zombie

3694.92 --> 3699.7200000000003
right

3697.2 --> 3701.7
unless you really cut his arm off very

3699.72 --> 3703.859
quickly well he doesn't want that he's

3701.7 --> 3705.66
scared but you want him to survive

3703.859 --> 3708.119
you're gonna cut his arm off

3705.66 --> 3710.46
and then he might survive if you don't

3708.119 --> 3712.92
then he's not gonna survive guaranteed

3710.46 --> 3715.079
and you might be in danger so the

3712.92 --> 3717.599
eugenic spirit would then drive you to

3715.079 --> 3722.6600000000003
do something so horrendous and brutal

3717.599 --> 3722.6600000000003
just so that your body can live

3723.18 --> 3728.819
that's the spirit of eugenics that's

3726.18 --> 3730.859
what drives it it's the love to do

3728.819 --> 3732.599
something horrendous because you know

3730.859 --> 3734.88
it's necessary

3732.599 --> 3737.46
that's eugenics

3734.88 --> 3740.819
not all we gotta just like

3737.46 --> 3745.079
down the percentages and lower the

3740.819 --> 3747.0
rebirth and that's not your that's just

3745.079 --> 3750.0
that's just

3747.0 --> 3750.0
annihilation

3750.119 --> 3756.559
that's genocide

3752.88 --> 3756.559
it's industrial genocide

3759.72 --> 3768.4199999999996
like genocide is not in the interest of

3763.859 --> 3772.5589999999997
eugenics why because

3768.42 --> 3774.119
with genocide entire Gene groups are

3772.559 --> 3777.599
gone

3774.119 --> 3780.48
you might need those Gene groups later

3777.599 --> 3784.1400000000003
not even joking

3780.48 --> 3787.079
like to me like every Gene group is like

3784.14 --> 3789.0589999999997
this part of stuff

3787.079 --> 3792.1800000000003
and yeah they might not function all

3789.059 --> 3794.46
that greatly but you don't know you

3792.18 --> 3797.2799999999997
don't know why they are the way they are

3794.46 --> 3800.46
what they have in them

3797.28 --> 3803.099
later in other developments like the

3800.46 --> 3804.9
three generations further they might

3803.099 --> 3808.1400000000003
procreate and then three generations

3804.9 --> 3810.6600000000003
further a doorman skill might suddenly

3808.14 --> 3813.96
pop up that was always there that is

3810.66 --> 3815.8799999999997
exactly what is necessary

3813.96 --> 3819.839
for then

3815.88 --> 3821.46
so I don't believe in genocide because I

3819.839 --> 3827.24
think that

3821.46 --> 3827.2400000000002
like every group has genetic traits

3827.46 --> 3832.98
that aren't even understood and that

3830.88 --> 3835.7000000000003
might be necessary

3832.98 --> 3840.359
for the future

3835.7 --> 3841.98
what race should we get rid of none

3840.359 --> 3844.04
and not any

3841.98 --> 3847.14
not even

3844.04 --> 3849.54
yeah I know not even the really gross

3847.14 --> 3852.7799999999997
ones I mean the point is you don't need

3849.54 --> 3855.119
to do that they'll do it themselves yeah

3852.78 --> 3857.2200000000003
they'll just in their delusion keeps

3855.119 --> 3860.1600000000003
poisoning themselves keep inbreeding and

3857.22 --> 3864.359
all that and then they just

3860.16 --> 3866.8799999999997
they mutate beyond the procreation point

3864.359 --> 3870.619
and then it's done then they're done you

3866.88 --> 3870.619
don't have to do anything

3870.9 --> 3876.7200000000003
right that's not what Eugenics Eugenics

3873.78 --> 3878.8190000000004
is not about calling the herd it's about

3876.72 --> 3880.3799999999997
guaranteeing survival

3878.819 --> 3884.22
but if you're gonna

3880.38 --> 3885.7200000000003
use that on a false premise of oh the

3884.22 --> 3888.54
world is going to end because of

3885.72 --> 3890.64
something that's obviously not happening

3888.54 --> 3893.52
well then you're just

3890.64 --> 3896.839
using a tool for the wrong reasons and

3893.52 --> 3896.839
then it's not Eugenics anymore

3899.72 --> 3906.6189999999997
it becomes oh the big ooga booga tells

3904.26 --> 3909.119
you you must kill all the people

3906.619 --> 3911.28
get angry

3909.119 --> 3914.04
and then it's like oh ooga boogers get

3911.28 --> 3917.099
angry we have to uh we have to like do

3914.04 --> 3919.619
more vaccination programs right

3917.099 --> 3923.599
because otherwise gets angry well that's

3919.619 --> 3923.599
called worshiping bail

3924.02 --> 3928.799
that's not Eugenics that's worshiping

3926.76 --> 3933.78
bail

3928.799 --> 3934.7
you gotta kill people or uh a God or

3933.78 --> 3939.0
whatever

3934.7 --> 3941.819
a demon a thing gets really angry

3939.0 --> 3944.819
or where it's scary like oh if we don't

3941.819 --> 3949.2799999999997
sacrifice the people then the disasters

3944.819 --> 3949.2799999999997
will happen I mean it's like

3949.44 --> 3957.0
that's like a tribal religion thing like

3953.76 --> 3958.559
bad like a bad Shaman in a third world

3957.0 --> 3959.819
country

3958.559 --> 3962.5400000000004
like

3959.819 --> 3962.54
dude

3963.18 --> 3969.2
and this is happening in the entire

3965.099 --> 3969.2000000000003
Western World I can't believe this

3970.859 --> 3974.94
but Europeans and Asians make the Water

3973.2 --> 3978.6189999999997
World

3974.94 --> 3978.619
yeah so what

3979.5 --> 3984.119
what's so [ __ ] good about the modern

3981.359 --> 3986.839
world other than the efficiency and all

3984.119 --> 3986.839
that I mean

3991.819 --> 3995.7799999999997
what's wrong with the others

4000.319 --> 4006.619
I mean Africans have very interesting

4003.619 --> 4006.619
abilities

4006.859 --> 4012.2
and they have this system where that

4009.5 --> 4016.039
that really makes them very like

4012.2 --> 4017.299
Africans are actually very eugenics

4016.039 --> 4019.46
because

4017.299 --> 4021.319
like you can't

4019.46 --> 4023.48
like they don't have procreation

4021.319 --> 4025.22
problems if you know what I mean

4023.48 --> 4028.4
yeah

4025.22 --> 4032.66
and I'm from a Eugenics perspective like

4028.4 --> 4035.599
other races are just [ __ ] jealous

4032.66 --> 4039.2599999999998
they're just jealous

4035.599 --> 4041.78
if if for somehow

4039.26 --> 4043.88
like Europeans and Asians could be

4041.78 --> 4046.7000000000003
genetically

4043.88 --> 4050.78
like synchronized with like African

4046.7 --> 4054.319
appropriation procreation ability they'd

4050.78 --> 4056.3590000000004
stop being jealous they'd be like oh

4054.319 --> 4057.5
yeah here yeah we have no procreation

4056.359 --> 4059.839
problem now

4057.5 --> 4061.339
now everybody gets overpopulation

4059.839 --> 4064.52
problems

4061.339 --> 4066.5
because Africans do actually have that

4064.52 --> 4068.599
and this is their own problem like they

4066.5 --> 4071.38
need to learn how to deal with it they

4068.599 --> 4071.38
do deal with it

4071.839 --> 4078.14
it's just not in a way that our Western

4075.14 --> 4080.0
heart really likes yeah they just do

4078.14 --> 4083.24
[ __ ] Tribal wars and it's just like

4080.0 --> 4085.28
oh yeah we need more room Slaughter

4083.24 --> 4087.6189999999997
Village splat

4085.28 --> 4088.8190000000004
it's really [ __ ] up but yeah that's

4087.619 --> 4091.7000000000003
what happens

4088.819 --> 4094.88
that's that becomes eugenics

4091.7 --> 4099.0199999999995
you could say that African tribes

4094.88 --> 4102.819
practice Eugenics more accurately

4099.02 --> 4102.819
than Western billionaires

4106.699 --> 4111.799
not to say I never said Eugenics was

4109.04 --> 4114.259
nice guys I never said it was it was oh

4111.799 --> 4117.859
you could do eugenics in a nice way no

4114.259 --> 4120.199
no that's the point is that Eugenics is

4117.859 --> 4122.660000000001
the point about it not how to deal with

4120.199 --> 4124.58
the things that aren't nice and still do

4122.66 --> 4126.799
the right thing

4124.58 --> 4128.66
that's the entire point of it otherwise

4126.799 --> 4131.719
it's not eugenics

4128.66 --> 4135.739
you should look into our

4131.719 --> 4139.06
K selection thing what

4135.739 --> 4139.0599999999995
I don't know what that is

4140.719 --> 4147.199
I need to ah my Illuminati car sounds

4143.48 --> 4148.849999999999
called damn it I'm gonna put it back in

4147.199 --> 4151.919
the oven

4148.85 --> 4151.919000000001
[Music]

4152.06 --> 4154.839000000001
be right back

4174.44 --> 4177.44
foreign

4194.76 --> 4197.879
[Music]

4204.8 --> 4208.179
[ __ ] are you blabbering about

4208.82 --> 4213.139999999999
in the real world oh yeah we were in the

4211.16 --> 4216.16
real world telling you a lot about the

4213.14 --> 4216.160000000001
real world right now

4217.94 --> 4220.54
laughs

4222.79 --> 4226.0
[Music]

4246.08 --> 4249.04
I'm just giving

4250.34 --> 4253.3
haha

4260.06 --> 4264.52
well that should be an enticing title

4264.86 --> 4269.179
how contracts with the devil really work

4266.9 --> 4271.58
and the misapplication of eugenics I

4269.179 --> 4274.9
mean exactly 100 characters I think we

4271.58 --> 4274.9
got another Super title

4278.06 --> 4282.56
yeah no stupid ass trolls is gonna ruin

4281.06 --> 4284.6
that for me don't worry I'm not gonna

4282.56 --> 4287.360000000001
get angry you see I'm not doing that I

4284.6 --> 4291.5
don't need to I already I literally like

4287.36 --> 4293.679
unloaded a giant gold nugget from my

4291.5 --> 4293.679
system

4295.159 --> 4300.259999999999
this is basically one of my best shows

4297.679 --> 4301.4
this week I mean I gotta say this week

4300.26 --> 4303.56
because

4301.4 --> 4306.5
these days sometimes they're just like

4303.56 --> 4308.2390000000005
unexpectedly have great performance out

4306.5 --> 4310.58
of nowhere when I really thought like oh

4308.239 --> 4315.099999999999
today's gonna be [ __ ] isn't it and then

4310.58 --> 4315.1
it isn't [ __ ] it's absolutely fabulous

4315.44 --> 4319.159
did I say

4317.06 --> 4320.84
fabulous what the [ __ ] that's not

4319.159 --> 4323.32
something I'm gonna adapt to my

4320.84 --> 4323.32
vernacular

4335.62 --> 4343.3
yeah right right slow-mo I mean

4338.9 --> 4343.299999999999
moxie what an idiot

4353.42 --> 4360.02
it's very to be a good guy

4356.84 --> 4362.96
is he the real deal

4360.02 --> 4364.040000000001
okay Flat Earth I'm watching him for

4362.96 --> 4367.4
weeks

4364.04 --> 4369.62
uh well is Eric to Bay the real deal I

4367.4 --> 4373.099999999999
mean he is a flat earther

4369.62 --> 4376.28
he is pretty consistent

4373.1 --> 4379.04
he's not the best guy it's not like

4376.28 --> 4381.679
super representative

4379.04 --> 4384.26
because he's like fanatical vegan and

4381.679 --> 4387.34
that kind of makes him [ __ ] that way

4384.26 --> 4387.34
really it does

4387.44 --> 4394.879999999999
and he well he literally

4391.179 --> 4397.4
defined his existence Define savonier

4394.88 --> 4399.62
syndrome but he's gotten a lot better

4397.4 --> 4402.92
though

4399.62 --> 4403.94
but yeah I mean Eric Dubai is a is a

4402.92 --> 4407.2390000000005
good

4403.94 --> 4409.879999999999
source to just check in if you really

4407.239 --> 4411.62
want to know all the details of Flat

4409.88 --> 4413.900000000001
Earth and Flat Earth arguments and

4411.62 --> 4416.48
what's happening with the Ballers though

4413.9 --> 4418.759999999999
Eric Dubai is not super good it's like

4416.48 --> 4420.5599999999995
he's just like Mark sardines like yeah

4418.76 --> 4422.360000000001
it's cool to follow you get to see

4420.56 --> 4424.1
what's around and

4422.36 --> 4426.199
you get to know a bit of like who's

4424.1 --> 4427.64
flatter through what what are they

4426.199 --> 4430.719
talking about

4427.64 --> 4435.08
but if you want to know the intrical

4430.719 --> 4437.54
arguments then well my channel and

4435.08 --> 4440.42
flatters debates and the people from The

4437.54 --> 4442.5199999999995
Flat Earth debates are really the only

4440.42 --> 4446.4800000000005
proper source

4442.52 --> 4448.820000000001
like we we understand it really well

4446.48 --> 4450.62
better than anybody else out there and

4448.82 --> 4454.48
we could say that without any

4450.62 --> 4454.48
reservation it is true

4455.0 --> 4460.82
we have set the standard flight of

4457.82 --> 4462.5599999999995
debate has set the standard like

4460.82 --> 4465.5
worldwide

4462.56 --> 4468.04
we've set the standard very proud to be

4465.5 --> 4468.04
part of that

4468.98 --> 4477.86
so if you want to learn about Flat Earth

4474.26 --> 4480.320000000001
stick to my chat and ask

4477.86 --> 4482.599999999999
like that's the funny part about this

4480.32 --> 4485.36
particular show is that I'm super

4482.6 --> 4487.46
interactive with the chat unlike

4485.36 --> 4490.58
flatters debates where jet is just

4487.46 --> 4493.04
commentary we're not super engaged with

4490.58 --> 4496.179
it oh on the early bird show I'm super

4493.04 --> 4496.179
engaged with the chat

4496.46 --> 4502.46
or I'm rolling out my own thing

4499.94 --> 4504.62
when I'm inspired but most of the time

4502.46 --> 4506.42
just really engage with the chat so you

4504.62 --> 4508.94
could just ask questions

4506.42 --> 4512.36
you can ask questions I'll answer I do

4508.94 --> 4514.46
answer unless I'm rambling and then I

4512.36 --> 4516.199
lose track of the chat and then I might

4514.46 --> 4517.58
overlook your question because I was

4516.199 --> 4520.659
talking for like 10 minutes straight

4517.58 --> 4520.659
that can happen

4527.12 --> 4532.699
seems like a big fan of Mr mustache oh

4531.56 --> 4535.179
goody

4532.699 --> 4535.178999999999
oh

4535.58 --> 4538.58
Maybe

4543.26 --> 4547.9400000000005
look fine if they want to be all

4545.92 --> 4550.04
neo-nazi-ish and think that makes them

4547.94 --> 4552.08
special boys if they like the goose

4550.04 --> 4555.62
stepping I get that

4552.08 --> 4557.719
I mean I was kind of like that myself

4555.62 --> 4559.699
in a way it's just

4557.719 --> 4562.3
I always thought that Hitler was kind of

4559.699 --> 4562.299999999999
[ __ ]

4562.76 --> 4565.54
really

4566.06 --> 4574.52
I mean in ways I like his style but I

4571.4 --> 4577.099999999999
also am like intelligent and conscious

4574.52 --> 4579.5
enough to know that he was kind of

4577.1 --> 4582.9400000000005
[ __ ] in ways

4579.5 --> 4582.94
not a very good leader

4586.34 --> 4592.84
weird obsessions that were very

4589.64 --> 4592.84
in productive

4593.179 --> 4598.46
like oh it wants everything big big big

4595.46 --> 4602.199
yeah that was a complete waste of time

4598.46 --> 4602.199
there's like a little kid obsession

4603.8 --> 4610.900000000001
he was a method yeah that too

4607.1 --> 4610.900000000001
or at least he became that

4616.58 --> 4621.92
or somebody that looked like him his

4620.06 --> 4623.96
lesbian double

4621.92 --> 4626.36
might be the math addict I'm not

4623.96 --> 4628.76
entirely sure when that all started

4626.36 --> 4631.639999999999
whether he himself was actually a meth

4628.76 --> 4635.02
addict or that is lesbian double that

4631.64 --> 4635.02
took over during the war

4636.5 --> 4640.699
was the meth head

4638.48 --> 4643.4
which makes perfect sense because like

4640.699 --> 4645.32
yeah you want to double well drug them

4643.4 --> 4647.679
and then they just need you forever

4645.32 --> 4651.4
they'll do whatever you say including

4647.679 --> 4651.4
pretending to be Hitler

4654.14 --> 4657.46
was a real jerk

4659.719 --> 4665.4800000000005
well the guy was driven by War trauma

4663.679 --> 4669.28
like he was a guy that's like

4665.48 --> 4669.28
permanently stuck in PTSD

4669.98 --> 4674.799999999999
I was always having weird PTSD [ __ ]

4675.98 --> 4681.0199999999995
because well he's been through that he's

4678.08 --> 4682.58
been super poisoned by poisonous gas and

4681.02 --> 4684.8
[ __ ] so

4682.58 --> 4689.32
I mean

4684.8 --> 4689.320000000001
I mean he was just a traumatized guy

4690.32 --> 4693.699
very traumatized

4696.08 --> 4700.219
I think you're on to yeah no [ __ ] I'm on

4698.12 --> 4702.62
to something

4700.219 --> 4704.659
duh why do you think that the burned

4702.62 --> 4706.94
body was female

4704.659 --> 4710.239
yeah it's not because Hitler was always

4706.94 --> 4711.98
a female that's ridiculous it's funny oh

4710.239 --> 4715.58
when Benjamin style but it is ridiculous

4711.98 --> 4718.28
I don't think so hit a double double

4715.58 --> 4719.6
was a woman that just happened to kind

4718.28 --> 4723.32
of look

4719.6 --> 4725.780000000001
like Hitler stick on mustache and could

4723.32 --> 4729.58
yell very loudly

4725.78 --> 4729.58
could talk like him

4731.6 --> 4737.360000000001
could make like screamy War speeches

4734.12 --> 4739.34
with with the same tone they probably

4737.36 --> 4741.259999999999
trained her to do that

4739.34 --> 4742.76
and she originally had that kind of

4741.26 --> 4744.62
voice they picked her out for that it's

4742.76 --> 4747.56
like it kind of looks alike

4744.62 --> 4749.96
can yell like that okay she'll take over

4747.56 --> 4753.04
and you just go to Argentina while all

4749.96 --> 4753.04
hell breaks loose here

4756.24 --> 4759.3099999999995
[Music]

4765.82 --> 4772.239
escaped or fought and died no he didn't

4769.1 --> 4772.2390000000005
fight and die

4773.42 --> 4777.9400000000005
he escaped way before

4778.04 --> 4783.86
I mean that wasn't hit the whole bunker

4780.8 --> 4786.62
that wasn't him it wasn't him

4783.86 --> 4790.099999999999
it was just the other one

4786.62 --> 4793.82
trying to follow the instructions

4790.1 --> 4797.6
like the lesbian Hitler

4793.82 --> 4800.299999999999
was basically the standing fake one was

4797.6 --> 4802.52
still trying to fulfill the role

4800.3 --> 4805.34
like upholding the act of like I'm

4802.52 --> 4809.620000000001
Hitler and trying to follow the plan

4805.34 --> 4809.62
and just it was all messing up

4810.08 --> 4815.0599999999995
and then she got a hysterical fit

4813.739 --> 4819.5599999999995
right

4815.06 --> 4823.84
like a lesbian rage thing happening

4819.56 --> 4823.84
I mean it makes perfect sense guys

4825.02 --> 4830.4800000000005
like during the war Hitler suddenly got

4827.719 --> 4834.199
this weird lesbian rage over him

4830.48 --> 4836.36
right that before the war he didn't have

4834.199 --> 4839.719
well maybe it's because

4836.36 --> 4843.0199999999995
sadly he actually was a lesbian

4839.719 --> 4845.56
and not the man that the man was in

4843.02 --> 4845.56
Argentina

4848.659 --> 4851.139999999999
right

4851.6 --> 4855.52
does that make any sense to you guys

4857.179 --> 4861.4400000000005
sounds like Owen Benjamin being a joker

4859.28 --> 4865.9
yeah but he was

4861.44 --> 4865.9
but I mean it is a thing it's official

4866.179 --> 4870.8
the suicide that Hitler body turned out

4869.3 --> 4874.4800000000005
to be a female

4870.8 --> 4874.4800000000005
and that's just official

4874.64 --> 4880.88
right now own Benjamin then concludes oh

4877.82 --> 4882.92
is she was always a woman

4880.88 --> 4883.9400000000005
trying to be a man going through the war

4882.92 --> 4886.34
and

4883.94 --> 4887.839999999999
but that doesn't make any freaking sense

4886.34 --> 4890.8
to me whatsoever

4887.84 --> 4890.8
it really doesn't

4894.38 --> 4899.06
because

4896.12 --> 4901.58
the Hitler that guy before the war

4899.06 --> 4904.04
really did seem very

4901.58 --> 4905.42
and they have that man's Spirit the

4904.04 --> 4908.0
spirit of like

4905.42 --> 4911.3
I want to defend my ladies I want to

4908.0 --> 4914.36
help my [ __ ] like he was very manly

4911.3 --> 4918.9800000000005
right but then in the war he became like

4914.36 --> 4922.04
a screaming lesbian maybe because he was

4918.98 --> 4925.459999999999
a screaming lesbian now and before he

4922.04 --> 4928.76
wasn't before that was the real man the

4925.46 --> 4931.159
real Patriot internally patriot-driven

4928.76 --> 4932.659000000001
man that wanted to make his country

4931.159 --> 4934.94
great again

4932.659 --> 4937.28
and then got caught up in this Grappler

4934.94 --> 4940.159
situation and then it's like okay

4937.28 --> 4942.679
they're gonna do this war no matter what

4940.159 --> 4945.139999999999
I'm getting the option to bolt and leave

4942.679 --> 4947.36
the replacement okay [ __ ] it I'm gonna

4945.14 --> 4949.88
go to Argentina and just live my life

4947.36 --> 4952.4
out here

4949.88 --> 4954.62
with my new wife

4952.4 --> 4958.46
and kids potentially

4954.62 --> 4960.98
right well lesbian Hitler standing takes

4958.46 --> 4964.42
over and basically does this war in

4960.98 --> 4964.419999999999
accordance to the grappler plan

4965.02 --> 4969.320000000001
I mean you could say about Hitler

4967.28 --> 4973.159
whatever you like but he freaking did

4969.32 --> 4976.28
sell out to the gravelers he did

4973.159 --> 4978.199
he gave them control over what was going

4976.28 --> 4980.78
to happen

4978.199 --> 4984.5599999999995
I mean you think a patriot

4980.78 --> 4986.78
a person that grew up fought in Wars the

4984.56 --> 4988.52
to defend their country and all that

4986.78 --> 4993.5
would just

4988.52 --> 4996.860000000001
send millions of German soldiers to

4993.5 --> 5000.88
their deaths in Stalingrad

4996.86 --> 5002.739
no now that's a raging foaming at the

5000.88 --> 5005.9800000000005
mouth lesbian that would do a such a

5002.739 --> 5009.58
thing not a patriot minded man that Lit

5005.98 --> 5012.459999999999
like he had fought the wars right

5009.58 --> 5014.199
if you're if you've been that soldier in

5012.46 --> 5018.219
the field getting shot at getting

5014.199 --> 5019.919999999999
horrible screaming fighting mowing down

5018.219 --> 5023.08
people with your machine guns right

5019.92 --> 5025.54
you're not just gonna send your [ __ ]

5023.08 --> 5028.42
men if you've actually you're not gonna

5025.54 --> 5031.84
send them to their death millions that

5028.42 --> 5034.96
that's totally insane Hitler would not

5031.84 --> 5037.659000000001
have done that he couldn't have he been

5034.96 --> 5040.44
through that it's insane he couldn't

5037.659 --> 5040.44
have done that

5041.199 --> 5045.9
like his own trauma would stop him

5046.179 --> 5052.4800000000005
but not if it wasn't him

5050.08 --> 5055.96
if he wasn't there to make these

5052.48 --> 5057.639999999999
decisions on the run if it was just a

5055.96 --> 5060.76
plan that was handed

5057.64 --> 5062.8
and she's a lesbian so it doesn't really

5060.76 --> 5065.1990000000005
have those Instinct never been through a

5062.8 --> 5067.0
war doesn't really know how bad it gets

5065.199 --> 5068.739
so then it's like yeah no we're going to

5067.0 --> 5070.179
take stardograph

5068.739 --> 5071.32
because they don't know what the [ __ ]

5070.179 --> 5073.659
they're actually talking about because

5071.32 --> 5076.08
that person didn't actually get through

5073.659 --> 5076.08
the war

5079.0 --> 5084.1
see and now certain things start to make

5082.179 --> 5086.56
a bit more sense

5084.1 --> 5089.38
to me and I mean this is all pure

5086.56 --> 5094.42
speculation okay

5089.38 --> 5097.06
but I just need to make more sense of it

5094.42 --> 5099.04
I don't think that Hitler during the war

5097.06 --> 5101.679
was the same person as Hitler from

5099.04 --> 5105.06
Before the War I really think they were

5101.679 --> 5105.06
completely different people

5109.48 --> 5112.48
foreign

5119.5 --> 5124.54
some say Hitler's was the mashiach

5122.5 --> 5126.12
because he brought in the state yes he

5124.54 --> 5129.1
was a Zionist

5126.12 --> 5130.9
dude the guy was a Zionist

5129.1 --> 5133.360000000001
and I don't even think that the original

5130.9 --> 5135.82
Hitler was anti-jew at all

5133.36 --> 5139.38
I don't think so

5135.82 --> 5141.82
I think he he tried to deal with the

5139.38 --> 5143.7390000000005
situation with all the freaking [ __ ]

5141.82 --> 5147.04
porn and [ __ ] that was getting rolled

5143.739 --> 5149.379999999999
out right before World War II in that

5147.04 --> 5151.84
period

5149.38 --> 5153.28
with the Treaty of Versailles he tried

5151.84 --> 5155.7390000000005
to do something about it but he was

5153.28 --> 5159.88
never anti-jew

5155.739 --> 5163.9
now the new Hitler the lesbian one

5159.88 --> 5166.659000000001
however that one might be like a person

5163.9 --> 5170.0199999999995
that's been like I don't know severely

5166.659 --> 5172.9
bullied by Jews or something

5170.02 --> 5174.360000000001
and that one I think that that's the one

5172.9 --> 5178.78
that did all their

5174.36 --> 5181.0
credit card we got to get the Jews I

5178.78 --> 5183.4
think that was her I think that was that

5181.0 --> 5185.679
hysterical [ __ ]

5183.4 --> 5187.239
that just really freaking hated it I

5185.679 --> 5190.4800000000005
don't think the original Hitler even

5187.239 --> 5193.9
hated Jews that much if he hated Jews

5190.48 --> 5196.9
that much then why the hell would like a

5193.9 --> 5200.5599999999995
quarter of his cabinet be Jews Like

5196.9 --> 5202.659
openly like it makes no sense guys that

5200.56 --> 5204.400000000001
makes no sense

5202.659 --> 5206.379999999999
I don't think the original Hitler

5204.4 --> 5208.299999999999
actually hated Jews I think that the

5206.38 --> 5212.02
lesbian replacement

5208.3 --> 5215.26
person tasked to do the war stuff I

5212.02 --> 5217.84
think she probably really hated Jews

5215.26 --> 5219.639
because of personal experience I don't

5217.84 --> 5221.9800000000005
think Hitler hated Jews at all he

5219.639 --> 5224.26
probably fought side by side during the

5221.98 --> 5226.178999999999
war his Wars with the Jews why the [ __ ]

5224.26 --> 5227.4400000000005
would he hate people that he fought side

5226.179 --> 5230.46
by side with

5227.44 --> 5230.46
makes no sense

5230.56 --> 5235.360000000001
yeah lesbian replacement yeah it's very

5232.659 --> 5238.92
it I know it sounds funny right lumpy

5235.36 --> 5238.92
guys but I'm actually quite serious

5248.26 --> 5253.360000000001
right so see it like this original

5250.659 --> 5257.799999999999
Hitler actually thought Jews were

5253.36 --> 5259.239
awesome and reliable and prosperous as

5257.8 --> 5261.34
long as they weren't doing like porn

5259.239 --> 5262.659
[ __ ] and all that they were as long as

5261.34 --> 5264.88
they weren't evil

5262.659 --> 5267.04
and then he thought like yeah man yeah

5264.88 --> 5268.96
they're always like oh we need to we if

5267.04 --> 5271.719
we only we had their own nation and like

5268.96 --> 5274.2390000000005
oh yeah yeah well why I'm Hitler why

5271.719 --> 5276.28
can't I just help them like yeah make

5274.239 --> 5277.178999999999
Israel we're gonna make Israel for the

5276.28 --> 5279.659
Jews

5277.179 --> 5279.659
like

5280.12 --> 5285.46
that's not the same person as oh we got

5283.48 --> 5288.339999999999
to get rid of them they're taking all

5285.46 --> 5289.36
everything we're gonna put them in camps

5288.34 --> 5292.12
like

5289.36 --> 5294.58
is that the same Hitler that said no

5292.12 --> 5296.0199999999995
we're gonna definitely organize an

5294.58 --> 5301.08
Israel

5296.02 --> 5301.080000000001
where Palestine is for for the Jews

5301.719 --> 5307.54
why the [ __ ] would he do that

5304.6 --> 5309.9400000000005
if he wanted to exterminate them

5307.54 --> 5313.56
that makes no [ __ ] sense

5309.94 --> 5313.5599999999995
it's not the same person

5315.639 --> 5321.88
see

5318.06 --> 5326.04
maybe you don't see I don't know

5321.88 --> 5326.04
I'm gonna get my Illuminati comes off

5336.46 --> 5339.3
foreign

5363.659 --> 5371.099999999999
yeah well maybe he did but I mean

5369.1 --> 5373.780000000001
Diddy's like ex

5371.1 --> 5377.8
anti-jew sentiment so it's like oh they

5373.78 --> 5379.599999999999
all have to be exterminated no

5377.8 --> 5384.06
and I personally think that he was

5379.6 --> 5384.06
probably referencing like Rothschild

5386.98 --> 5390.0599999999995
that sort of thing

5390.159 --> 5393.5199999999995
right

5391.36 --> 5395.62
a lot of times the way I see like oh the

5393.52 --> 5398.280000000001
juice I'm thinking like now he means

5395.62 --> 5398.28
Rothschild

5398.86 --> 5403.12
not

5400.0 --> 5406.6
the religion

5403.12 --> 5411.12
he means those cartel people

5406.6 --> 5411.120000000001
that's what then it makes sense you see

5411.76 --> 5415.659000000001
we just think it's weird I don't know

5413.679 --> 5417.34
who the [ __ ] are you talking defending

5415.659 --> 5419.98
I'm not defending anything I'm just

5417.34 --> 5422.8
trying to get things accurate

5419.98 --> 5424.78
the guy is dead

5422.8 --> 5428.26
who cares

5424.78 --> 5430.78
I just want to get it right

5428.26 --> 5432.219
I just want things to actually make

5430.78 --> 5435.239
sense

5432.219 --> 5437.679
and it doesn't make sense yeah

5435.239 --> 5442.178999999999
post-war Hitler

5437.679 --> 5444.9400000000005
is not the same person as pre-war Hitler

5442.179 --> 5448.7390000000005
not the same actions not the same plans

5444.94 --> 5448.739
not the same attitude

5453.4 --> 5458.379999999999
he said usually undermining the German

5455.32 --> 5461.799999999999
culture was yeah but this right about

5458.38 --> 5466.0
isn't he right isn't that just called

5461.8 --> 5467.7390000000005
really like valid criticism

5466.0 --> 5470.139
yeah

5467.739 --> 5472.419999999999
does that mean he [ __ ] wants them all

5470.139 --> 5474.159000000001
exterminated just because he's pointing

5472.42 --> 5475.84
out like yeah that's an issue we don't

5474.159 --> 5478.179
want that for our nation it's not good

5475.84 --> 5480.46
for our nation oh so that means extra

5478.179 --> 5482.5
donate all the Jews no it doesn't

5480.46 --> 5485.76
[ __ ] mean that

5482.5 --> 5485.76
that's ridiculous

5496.3 --> 5499.62
hello Bob Lemke

5500.62 --> 5505.54
all right anyway

5503.08 --> 5509.4
I'm gonna finally take a bite out of

5505.54 --> 5509.4
this I'm really hungry hmm

5525.01 --> 5528.14
[Music]

5538.54 --> 5544.56
you can never get his story correct no

5541.719 --> 5544.56
you can

5544.6 --> 5549.9400000000005
you can take all the information

5547.719 --> 5552.34
and then you can

5549.94 --> 5555.0
figure out what is possible and what is

5552.34 --> 5555.0
not possible

5564.1 --> 5568.4400000000005
that's what you can do and that's what I

5566.08 --> 5568.44
am doing

5574.659 --> 5578.92
I would actually love to have a

5576.84 --> 5581.38
elaborate conversation with Owen

5578.92 --> 5583.36
Benjamin about this because he did

5581.38 --> 5585.659000000001
actually study the history books about

5583.36 --> 5585.659
it

5587.86 --> 5594.099999999999
so he might have a lot more detailed

5590.34 --> 5596.1990000000005
insights about that would potentially

5594.1 --> 5598.42
support my my idea

5596.199 --> 5600.28
I just like I would love to discuss this

5598.42 --> 5603.3
with him

5600.28 --> 5603.3
at some point

5620.5 --> 5622.92
yeah

5623.28 --> 5627.48
so-called three thinkers yeah yeah

5631.54 --> 5638.639
no I'm actually the three singer I'm the

5635.02 --> 5638.639
free thinker here yeah

5641.62 --> 5647.62
this is the most

5643.3 --> 5649.360000000001
three thinking show on the internet

5647.62 --> 5651.639
and I mean

5649.36 --> 5654.179
I can actually kind of say that with a

5651.639 --> 5654.179
straight face

5654.58 --> 5657.6
I really am

5659.44 --> 5663.159
I am kind of like a little miracle here

5661.78 --> 5665.62
on YouTube

5663.159 --> 5668.379999999999
I can address things that normally would

5665.62 --> 5670.599999999999
be like people would definitely get

5668.38 --> 5675.719
flagged all the time and they get into

5670.6 --> 5675.719
trouble but because of how I do it

5677.26 --> 5681.46
I get away with it

5679.179 --> 5685.26
because it's just really freaking

5681.46 --> 5685.26
interesting and to everybody

5690.54 --> 5695.92
right the views are not gonna reflect

5693.52 --> 5698.620000000001
that though but

5695.92 --> 5701.139
ideas don't need view is the spread they

5698.62 --> 5704.32
just need eyes they need a few eyes they

5701.139 --> 5707.5
need a few minds they settle there and

5704.32 --> 5708.58
then they move on from those views

5707.5 --> 5712.679
like

5708.58 --> 5712.679
my idea could spill over like

5713.92 --> 5720.3
several people and end up like with

5717.1 --> 5720.3
millions of people

5721.3 --> 5724.96
even though those millions of people

5722.92 --> 5727.96
would have never seen my show they might

5724.96 --> 5730.3
end up with these ideas

5727.96 --> 5733.0
yeah my idea is that I'm out rolling out

5730.3 --> 5737.56
that are barely being watched they might

5733.0 --> 5740.26
be like standard opinion in 10 years I'm

5737.56 --> 5742.2390000000005
not kidding you guys I'm not kidding you

5740.26 --> 5745.12
it could very well be

5742.239 --> 5747.099999999999
but these ideas will be like

5745.12 --> 5749.32
standard someday

5747.1 --> 5752.1
even though they seem so outrageous now

5749.32 --> 5752.099999999999
to some

5758.8 --> 5762.400000000001
I love my confidence

5761.02 --> 5765.96
yeah

5762.4 --> 5765.96
and it's Justified too

5774.78 --> 5781.239
I mean at some point people are just

5778.719 --> 5784.199
gonna spot a pattern of how I was

5781.239 --> 5784.199
calling things out

5785.739 --> 5790.48
at the right time when nobody even

5787.42 --> 5794.02
understood what the hell is going on

5790.48 --> 5797.218999999999
at some point people will start to

5794.02 --> 5797.219
figure that out about me

5815.08 --> 5819.4
okay

5816.34 --> 5823.8
one day people will recognize me

5819.4 --> 5823.799999999999
for my Oracle skill they will

5824.92 --> 5829.179
right

5826.96 --> 5833.26
but getting recognition for this skill

5829.179 --> 5836.08
is not my priority in life

5833.26 --> 5839.1990000000005
it's much more important that I learn

5836.08 --> 5840.88
Ed how to properly apply it that's more

5839.199 --> 5844.299999999999
important than that people are learning

5840.88 --> 5846.4800000000005
to learning or listening at all

5844.3 --> 5846.4800000000005
foreign

5865.89 --> 5869.179
[Music]

5875.46 --> 5879.58
seek God

5877.96 --> 5882.46
no God

5879.58 --> 5883.96
realize God

5882.46 --> 5886.9800000000005
apply God

5883.96 --> 5886.9800000000005
recognize God

5893.1 --> 5896.52
learn God

5909.36 --> 5913.44
okay thanks Jason

5935.28 --> 5941.94
ah wow that that car song hit this

5939.58 --> 5941.94
button

5941.98 --> 5945.299999999999
I almost want another one

5950.8 --> 5953.8
hmm

5958.36 --> 5963.639
right but yes definitely do support me I

5961.239 --> 5967.12
would really appreciate that especially

5963.639 --> 5968.9800000000005
for having a kick ass episode of the

5967.12 --> 5971.139
early bird show like today

5968.98 --> 5973.86
like this is one that I actually want to

5971.139 --> 5973.86
watch back myself

5975.1 --> 5978.120000000001
save it for the weekend

5979.48 --> 5985.379999999999
honestly don't think the Creator cares

5981.46 --> 5985.38
or if we acknowledge it or not

5985.719 --> 5988.5
what

5989.62 --> 5995.08
well I'll come over is we technically

5992.02 --> 5999.6990000000005
don't even know if caring is a trait

5995.08 --> 6002.4
that the actual creator has the designer

5999.699 --> 6006.178999999999
we know that we've been imbued

6002.4 --> 6006.179
with caring

6006.84 --> 6013.1990000000005
and that it is grafted Within

6010.44 --> 6016.5199999999995
the spectrum of

6013.199 --> 6016.5199999999995
good attributes

6020.28 --> 6026.36
but yeah I am I totally deep personify

6023.94 --> 6026.36
God

6026.46 --> 6031.56
so

6028.44 --> 6033.54
I don't think he's anything like like

6031.56 --> 6035.88
what we are

6033.54 --> 6038.6
well he's probably We Are Made In His

6035.88 --> 6038.6
Image but

6041.46 --> 6048.2390000000005
like he's it shouldn't be concerned with

6046.739 --> 6052.138999999999
anything

6048.239 --> 6054.299999999999
he just designed it like there's no need

6052.139 --> 6057.900000000001
for action

6054.3 --> 6059.219
he just designed it it all was and it

6057.9 --> 6061.08
all will be

6059.219 --> 6065.12
that's how I see it

6061.08 --> 6065.12
like God doesn't need to intervene

6068.159 --> 6073.46
it's all designed to intervene for God

6074.34 --> 6078.6
the workings of the realm have been

6076.38 --> 6083.82
designed to intervene

6078.6 --> 6085.1990000000005
for God because God the actual thing The

6083.82 --> 6087.719
Entity

6085.199 --> 6090.48
that designed it all

6087.719 --> 6094.219
he doesn't have to do anything or be

6090.48 --> 6094.218999999999
anything he just designed it

6099.719 --> 6106.9800000000005
you must love God yeah well I do

6103.8 --> 6111.139
I love the knowledge that there is a

6106.98 --> 6115.28
designer I love how he designed us

6111.139 --> 6115.28
despite all the downsides

6116.82 --> 6122.4
I love the rule that I want to play them

6120.719 --> 6125.28
right

6122.4 --> 6129.42
I love the challenge and how it punishes

6125.28 --> 6132.0
us and how we gain wisdom from that I

6129.42 --> 6134.52
love all of it I love the Dark Side of

6132.0 --> 6137.88
God I love all of it I mean I can't

6134.52 --> 6141.06
always handle it but I I strive to love

6137.88 --> 6143.46
it even the dark Parts like I'm not

6141.06 --> 6145.9800000000005
gonna like oh compartment oh God will

6143.46 --> 6149.28
never do anything evil go [ __ ] yourself

6145.98 --> 6152.0
yeah it's all been designed it's all

6149.28 --> 6152.0
part of the system

6153.719 --> 6160.82
evil exists to challenge good

6157.38 --> 6160.82
that's just the way it is

6170.219 --> 6177.659
no divine intervention well

6174.54 --> 6180.179
not literally I mean there will be like

6177.659 --> 6183.259999999999
divine intervention as in mechanisms

6180.179 --> 6186.42
that are there specifically to intervene

6183.26 --> 6189.06
in the name of God as per Harris Design

6186.42 --> 6191.88
it's just he's not actually doing

6189.06 --> 6194.4800000000005
anything he just designed the world to

6191.88 --> 6200.82
do everything for him

6194.48 --> 6203.759999999999
including what would seem like miracles

6200.82 --> 6205.739
like I believe in magical things I

6203.76 --> 6208.02
believe in walking over water I believe

6205.739 --> 6210.419999999999
in lightning bolts

6208.02 --> 6211.56
I believe in storms being created by

6210.42 --> 6213.54
people

6211.56 --> 6216.179
and holding their hands up I believe

6213.54 --> 6218.42
that and I believe it's all part of the

6216.179 --> 6218.42
design

6222.06 --> 6226.7390000000005
I don't even believe that magic is evil

6224.46 --> 6229.38
I just believe that

6226.739 --> 6233.218999999999
it has a price doing things have prices

6229.38 --> 6235.26
all things that do anything that you do

6233.219 --> 6238.199
will have a price you will pay a price

6235.26 --> 6240.3
no matter what you do you see

6238.199 --> 6242.099999999999
but some things have higher prices than

6240.3 --> 6244.5
others

6242.1 --> 6246.54
and if you're gonna go with like what

6244.5 --> 6248.699
would be considered as magic that would

6246.54 --> 6251.82
be really dramatic because it just

6248.699 --> 6255.0
Alters things or whatever well then the

6251.82 --> 6258.0
price will be really freaking high and

6255.0 --> 6261.9
Jesus warns against that what he

6258.0 --> 6264.84
basically says in my view this is not

6261.9 --> 6267.0599999999995
quotation but in my view what he means

6264.84 --> 6268.38
to say is like the price is not actually

6267.06 --> 6271.139
worth it

6268.38 --> 6274.02
just like the knowledge of Good and Evil

6271.139 --> 6276.02
is not actually worth it

6274.02 --> 6276.02
um

6277.619 --> 6283.0199999999995
right

6279.78 --> 6284.58
so it should never be standardized it

6283.02 --> 6288.179
should never be industrialized met

6284.58 --> 6290.04
because it always takes away right it

6288.179 --> 6292.139
should not be normalized

6290.04 --> 6293.34
so in that sense magic could be

6292.139 --> 6296.1
considered

6293.34 --> 6297.54
as drugs right you have hard drugs you

6296.1 --> 6300.0
have soft drugs

6297.54 --> 6302.88
none of them are really good but some

6300.0 --> 6304.8
are just way more pricey than others and

6302.88 --> 6306.54
will have more devastating consequences

6304.8 --> 6309.84
for you

6306.54 --> 6312.139
using them well the same would count for

6309.84 --> 6312.139
Magic

6317.46 --> 6319.94
right

6323.82 --> 6328.759999999999
if you'll find a way to like make deals

6326.699 --> 6332.58
with entities and do something

6328.76 --> 6335.52
extraordinary or have like this power

6332.58 --> 6339.0
manifesting according to your design

6335.52 --> 6341.400000000001
well then you're playing High magic and

6339.0 --> 6343.82
high magic has a high price

6341.4 --> 6346.86
it will have a high price for your life

6343.82 --> 6349.98
during your life you will feel it you

6346.86 --> 6352.639
will feel that price every day and it

6349.98 --> 6352.638999999999
will never go away

6354.3 --> 6362.58
and you will feel how the natural

6359.06 --> 6365.639
deployment of your life will have been

6362.58 --> 6367.739
availed by the application of the magic

6365.639 --> 6370.08
that you wanted

6367.739 --> 6372.36
those are the things that you will sense

6370.08 --> 6375.119
and that will be the price you will know

6372.36 --> 6378.48
how magic ruined your life when you use

6375.119 --> 6381.239
it that's the price

6378.48 --> 6383.04
that's God's price that's the the price

6381.239 --> 6387.178999999999
for the sin

6383.04 --> 6389.219
is that you now know how you ruin it how

6387.179 --> 6392.28
you sacrificed for the thing that

6389.219 --> 6394.8
probably didn't really seem worth it for

6392.28 --> 6397.259999999999
most people right this very rarely that

6394.8 --> 6401.159000000001
people like okay I'm gonna do a really

6397.26 --> 6404.04
high magic and I have to do it or else

6401.159 --> 6406.138999999999
that rarely happens most people just try

6404.04 --> 6408.84
things out they just they're just

6406.139 --> 6411.4800000000005
curious they want to see what it's like

6408.84 --> 6414.4800000000005
and then they end up doing things that

6411.48 --> 6416.699
will have very Hefty prices and like an

6414.48 --> 6418.98
enormous influence on their entire

6416.699 --> 6421.5199999999995
spirit and development that they can't

6418.98 --> 6421.5199999999995
undo

6421.56 --> 6424.9400000000005
that's the price of magic

6430.86 --> 6435.299999999999
you always intervention yeah whatever

6432.6 --> 6437.659000000001
Jason McCormick I I am not into idolatry

6435.3 --> 6437.659000000001
yeah

6437.82 --> 6443.5199999999995
Jesus is not God

6440.159 --> 6446.099999999999
and God is not a man

6443.52 --> 6448.9800000000005
and everybody that chance that is

6446.1 --> 6452.46
literally the devil's slave

6448.98 --> 6455.759999999999
the slave too lies in illogic that you

6452.46 --> 6459.119
are made to accept out of fear out of

6455.76 --> 6464.400000000001
fear from a false dichotomy of an

6459.119 --> 6464.4
afterlife it's absolutely horrendous

6467.699 --> 6470.699
good

6485.46 --> 6490.139
Jesus is very much a prophet though and

6487.619 --> 6493.38
he is I do definitely personally

6490.139 --> 6496.86
reference him as he is he was the best

6493.38 --> 6499.92
of us it's like the ultimate example the

6496.86 --> 6502.699
number one teacher of all times

6499.92 --> 6502.6990000000005
Jesus Christ

6506.58 --> 6512.88
or you could say the first true priest

6510.659 --> 6515.5199999999995
and which is

6512.88 --> 6518.119
a concept that's just been eternally

6515.52 --> 6518.119000000001
corrupted

6523.739 --> 6529.44
and the humans in His image yes

6526.56 --> 6530.820000000001
and that can mean anything

6529.44 --> 6535.5599999999995
yeah

6530.82 --> 6537.96
His Image is not his likeness oh notice

6535.56 --> 6540.42
notice how it's not the word likeness

6537.96 --> 6542.76
even though the word likeness is used a

6540.42 --> 6546.4800000000005
lot in the Bible huh yeah it's not the

6542.76 --> 6548.76
word likeness it's image image image

6546.48 --> 6554.0
image image image yeah

6548.76 --> 6554.0
which means picture or View

6554.34 --> 6560.179
yeah

6556.26 --> 6564.659000000001
so it could very well mean made humans

6560.179 --> 6569.4
within his view within his sight

6564.659 --> 6572.0599999999995
he made God within his creation

6569.4 --> 6572.0599999999995
he

6575.159 --> 6581.46
as in God is watching his creation he

6578.52 --> 6584.219
made them in His image

6581.46 --> 6588.199
because creation is his image this is

6584.219 --> 6588.199
his image this is the thing that he made

6591.6 --> 6597.2390000000005
right and if you're into like a

6594.179 --> 6599.1
holographic Theory that oh it's all a

6597.239 --> 6600.959999999999
simulation hologram or something well

6599.1 --> 6603.54
yeah then you could say well that would

6600.96 --> 6606.119
make reality an image wouldn't it yeah

6603.54 --> 6610.86
if this is indeed a hologram well then

6606.119 --> 6612.0599999999995
it's definitely an image isn't it

6610.86 --> 6614.96
yeah

6612.06 --> 6614.96
there you go

6617.219 --> 6621.38
came to Uber yeah that's all very cute

6621.78 --> 6629.099999999999
but uh yeah something can come to you

6626.34 --> 6633.06
and it can take the form

6629.1 --> 6635.04
of whatever you would consider to be God

6633.06 --> 6638.1
within your mind

6635.04 --> 6643.34
but that is not God

6638.1 --> 6643.34
because God does not separate himself

6644.34 --> 6651.179
like into becoming

6648.239 --> 6655.5199999999995
a participant of the thing that he

6651.179 --> 6655.52
created that's absolutely preposterous

6656.4 --> 6664.5599999999995
like are you going to be a character in

6661.44 --> 6666.659
the video game that you programmed as in

6664.56 --> 6669.96
literally as in you are not there

6666.659 --> 6672.96
anymore as a human flesh being but

6669.96 --> 6675.9
you're going to actually then transition

6672.96 --> 6677.28
yourself into being a video game

6675.9 --> 6680.638999999999
character

6677.28 --> 6682.92
and not be a person anymore not be a

6680.639 --> 6685.02
flesh being anymore

6682.92 --> 6687.659
no

6685.02 --> 6690.2390000000005
no you're not and it's a ridiculous

6687.659 --> 6695.4
notion that anybody would ever do that

6690.239 --> 6698.218999999999
so whatever God has as involvements with

6695.4 --> 6700.799999999999
with people on Earth you might send an

6698.219 --> 6701.76
avatar you might send a representative

6700.8 --> 6705.42
or

6701.76 --> 6706.92
those an angel

6705.42 --> 6709.619
yeah

6706.92 --> 6712.56
is that what angels are

6709.619 --> 6713.82
aren't they the hands

6712.56 --> 6716.9400000000005
and

6713.82 --> 6719.699
the mouth of God

6716.94 --> 6722.4
the Angels because God doesn't actually

6719.699 --> 6723.799999999999
show up

6722.4 --> 6726.659
it's even

6723.8 --> 6729.659000000001
mythologically said that nobody can gaze

6726.659 --> 6731.638999999999
upon the actual God because you would be

6729.659 --> 6734.54
burned

6731.639 --> 6736.86
out of existence or something right

6734.54 --> 6740.5199999999995
slightly paraphrasing there

6736.86 --> 6743.599999999999
but yeah well maybe then he just doesn't

6740.52 --> 6743.6
do that then

6754.199 --> 6758.58
right

6756.54 --> 6761.34
and I think that

6758.58 --> 6763.26
in the spirit realm in our minds in our

6761.34 --> 6765.0
dreams God might

6763.26 --> 6767.9400000000005
have

6765.0 --> 6771.42
an avatar and just come and seek you out

6767.94 --> 6773.699
and do things

6771.42 --> 6776.28
but how would you ever know that that is

6773.699 --> 6778.08
God that that is actually God like even

6776.28 --> 6780.96
if he did follow what if it's another

6778.08 --> 6783.42
entity that just decides like you know

6780.96 --> 6784.7390000000005
what I'm just gonna play God and I'm

6783.42 --> 6786.36
just gonna do her just right I'm gonna

6784.739 --> 6788.699
get in that skin until they're all

6786.36 --> 6791.9
convinced that I'm actually God yeah

6788.699 --> 6791.9
what if it's that

6792.6 --> 6798.84
because I've experienced that I call it

6796.199 --> 6803.339999999999
the man in Black

6798.84 --> 6806.82
the black robed bearded man

6803.34 --> 6808.92
who claimed to be God in my Dark World

6806.82 --> 6810.9
Visions even tried to demonstrate it to

6808.92 --> 6813.4800000000005
me

6810.9 --> 6816.199
but

6813.48 --> 6819.178999999999
by deducing logically

6816.199 --> 6821.339999999999
what he did

6819.179 --> 6823.26
throughout divisions what he told me

6821.34 --> 6826.4400000000005
what he taught me

6823.26 --> 6831.5
the conclusion was it cannot be God like

6826.44 --> 6831.5
that can't be God it cannot be only God

6831.6 --> 6838.76
because they had traits that just

6835.44 --> 6838.759999999999
were beastly

6840.6 --> 6846.179
there are only like driven by Earthly

6843.84 --> 6850.159000000001
forces and that can't be part of God

6846.179 --> 6850.159
that like why would the designer

6851.1 --> 6853.639
like

6854.88 --> 6861.1990000000005
uh now I'm putting myself in a quarter

6856.8 --> 6861.1990000000005
maybe maybe it does make sense maybe God

6862.1 --> 6867.4800000000005
maybe we just don't understand I don't

6865.56 --> 6870.06
know the point is is that it's illogical

6867.48 --> 6873.718999999999
for God to actually manifest

6870.06 --> 6876.54
single himself out and become take

6873.719 --> 6878.76
partaking in the creation that he made

6876.54 --> 6882.239
that doesn't make sense

6878.76 --> 6885.6
like he made time was like linear time

6882.239 --> 6887.638999999999
was created for this existence he's

6885.6 --> 6890.76
outside of that why the hell would he

6887.639 --> 6893.1
time bound himself

6890.76 --> 6896.42
and then partake like it makes no

6893.1 --> 6896.42
[ __ ] sense whatsoever

6905.4 --> 6910.199
right

6906.719 --> 6913.199
well it does make sense however is that

6910.199 --> 6916.799999999999
people get Fantastical Insight through

6913.199 --> 6919.919999999999
good good properties and and focus and

6916.8 --> 6922.02
skill and trust and wisdom over the ages

6919.92 --> 6923.46
and generations of passing that through

6922.02 --> 6925.619000000001
and

6923.46 --> 6928.52
and then somebody like Jesus comes along

6925.619 --> 6933.659
and perfects it and just gets it

6928.52 --> 6935.52
perfectly right and has insights Beyond

6933.659 --> 6937.44
others

6935.52 --> 6938.9400000000005
but just following the discipline

6937.44 --> 6941.28
basically like

6938.94 --> 6943.98
that makes perfect sense

6941.28 --> 6946.5599999999995
that Visionaries would stand up by

6943.98 --> 6948.9
synchronizing with the understanding of

6946.56 --> 6951.42
creation and what is good and what is

6948.9 --> 6953.219
bad because of the implications the

6951.42 --> 6955.5
whole pattern if they just attuned to

6953.219 --> 6958.02
the pattern and it could perfect it

6955.5 --> 6960.9
well then yeah somebody like Jesus Jesus

6958.02 --> 6963.659000000001
arriving makes perfect sense

6960.9 --> 6966.839999999999
it doesn't make them God

6963.659 --> 6968.638999999999
it just makes them understand God

6966.84 --> 6971.159000000001
because that's really what it is do you

6968.639 --> 6973.26
understand God

6971.159 --> 6976.259999999999
do you understand this creation how

6973.26 --> 6979.139
things are why things are the way they

6976.26 --> 6981.719
are do you understand God

6979.139 --> 6985.04
I think I got a long way I'm not there

6981.719 --> 6985.04
yet but I'm getting there

6985.88 --> 6991.56
understanding it understanding why

6989.28 --> 6994.86
things are the way they are

6991.56 --> 6998.54
and if you end up in that argument

6994.86 --> 7001.699
basically driven by your own personal

6998.54 --> 7005.44
short-term Ambitions or longings

7001.699 --> 7005.44
well then you can't get it

7005.96 --> 7013.659
then in the end it is your Earthly

7008.5 --> 7013.659
impulses that drive you and not God

7015.38 --> 7020.719
because

7017.119 --> 7023.839999999999
the real thing is not simple it's like a

7020.719 --> 7026.42
hyper fractal pattern of everything

7023.84 --> 7027.92
that's synchronized a gigantic fractal

7026.42 --> 7031.58
web

7027.92 --> 7034.9400000000005
that's like a crystal held together and

7031.58 --> 7037.34
we just are not attuned to it with our

7034.94 --> 7040.098999999999
Consciousness our Consciousness is

7037.34 --> 7042.619000000001
deprived from it to kind of like

7040.099 --> 7044.92
make it more subjective and in the

7042.619 --> 7044.92
moment

7046.04 --> 7049.76
that's where our Consciousness typically

7048.02 --> 7052.9400000000005
dwells

7049.76 --> 7055.34
not within the absolute oversight and

7052.94 --> 7058.638999999999
Ultra connectivity of everything I mean

7055.34 --> 7060.4400000000005
we might get there slightly in a kind of

7058.639 --> 7062.900000000001
like a hippie dippy mode or whatever

7060.44 --> 7065.419999999999
sorry to keep saying that

7062.9 --> 7067.339999999999
but you're not actually gonna grip it

7065.42 --> 7069.38
you might know that it's there but

7067.34 --> 7071.96
you're not actually going to be able to

7069.38 --> 7074.06
stay there and utilize it and translate

7071.96 --> 7076.28
it into your actions

7074.06 --> 7078.580000000001
because that's not what we're meant to

7076.28 --> 7078.58
do

7079.699 --> 7083.0599999999995
we're meant to be in that retracted

7081.86 --> 7085.699
state

7083.06 --> 7089.54
where we get subjected to more

7085.699 --> 7089.54
subjective approaches

7089.84 --> 7096.619000000001
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

7093.199 --> 7099.379999999999
it's been a really good one

7096.619 --> 7100.94
I could use a break too and yeah the

7099.38 --> 7103.58
flight Earth debate has already started

7100.94 --> 7106.159

is not just gonna accept that I throw

7150.32 --> 7154.4
out gems like this and then literally

7152.179 --> 7158.0
