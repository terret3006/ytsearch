2.75 --> 12.269
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.779 --> 18.380000000000003
early-bird number 52 I'm your host

12.269 --> 28.08
Arwen and yeah this is the last day of

18.38 --> 30.81
2018 and yeah it's it's a dry day at

28.08 --> 32.91
least the fifth people lighting off

30.81 --> 35.64
fireworks over the place

32.91 --> 41.669999999999995
oh yeah by the way was just told me over

35.64 --> 44.28
Skype that it's now just yeah it's New

41.67 --> 49.260000000000005
Years Eve for him over in Australia so

44.28 --> 51.86
happy new year was don't overdo the

49.26 --> 51.86
alcohol

52.48 --> 56.16
and be careful with firework

62.41 --> 68.97
so yeah I'm not late thank you very much

66.28 --> 68.97
Russell

69.74 --> 72.369
what

73.36 --> 77.73
wait what's going on

100.76 --> 103.39
right

103.53 --> 107.7
I thought for a moment that I wasn't

105.45 --> 109.83
live but apparently yeah there's the

107.7 --> 116.79
second page and it's still waiting for

109.83 --> 121.97
me very annoying but yeah I can see from

116.79 --> 121.97
the live dashboard that I am indeed life

125.06 --> 127.75
so

128.05 --> 131.52
yeah how are you guys doing

133.88 --> 137.26
I think I see the problem

137.68 --> 146.109
I think I have the wrong chat visible so

143.56 --> 149.5
let's fix that so annoying how this

146.109 --> 155.34900000000002
works two separate chats but I can't

149.5 --> 158.609
yeah I can't prevent this so yeah

155.349 --> 158.60899999999998
there's the actual chat

163.02 --> 166.02
yeah

169.04 --> 180.01
yeah so I guess you haven't seen my

171.319 --> 182.629
texts either but yeah no I am on time

180.01 --> 189.54899999999998
so how are you guys all doing are you

182.629 --> 189.54899999999998
ready for 2019 I am

190.209 --> 194.099
things are going to be looking pretty

191.89 --> 194.099
good

197.58 --> 206.94
and a piece of memory revealed to me

199.89 --> 210.95999999999998
again from visions that I'm pretty damn

206.94 --> 214.56
sure it was not imagined because of the

210.96 --> 217.11
extra sensory details that were present

214.56 --> 219.99
during that moment and I was looking

217.11 --> 223.71
pretty good so I'm not gonna die anytime

219.99 --> 228.54000000000002
soon and my situation was overall

223.71 --> 232.79000000000002
improved financially self certainty wise

228.54 --> 237.63
and I had more connection talk to more

232.79 --> 239.91
older people just flat earthers so also

237.63 --> 243.32999999999998
remembering and this I remember even

239.91 --> 246.45
from before that but from another

243.33 --> 250.86
mindset where I would be discussing Flat

246.45 --> 254.42
Earth issues with a lot of other people

250.86 --> 257.67
that don't show their faces here and

254.42 --> 260.489
that was pretty interesting I can't wait

257.67 --> 262.71000000000004
for that to happen and yeah I did indeed

260.489 --> 266.88
during those moments possess the skill

262.71 --> 268.2
that I do right now maybe even better so

266.88 --> 274.98
looking forward to that

268.2 --> 277.95
I just have to stop letting all the bad

274.98 --> 280.14000000000004
memories get in my way and try to keep

277.95 --> 282.9
doing the right thing and yeah there's

280.14 --> 284.43
been some issues here and there it's

282.9 --> 289.78999999999996
team Osmonds

284.43 --> 293.419
and I've been not very PC towards him

289.79 --> 293.41900000000004
but just

295.139 --> 300.06
I guess it's just another disappointment

298.229 --> 303.659
because I thought look this guy is doing

300.06 --> 307.74
kind of an interesting debate thing so I

303.659 --> 309.87
basically challenged him and he just was

307.74 --> 311.52
unbearable I went on there five minutes

309.87 --> 312.36
but he said yeah it's not gonna work in

311.52 --> 316.43
five minutes

312.36 --> 319.139
and he immediately started to

316.43 --> 321.33
red-herring me and then declare all

319.139 --> 323.43
kinds of [ __ ] about me about what I

321.33 --> 326.31
supposedly think what group I'm part of

323.43 --> 331.319
and I just yeah I snapped

326.31 --> 334.199
he said go F yourself and left then

331.319 --> 337.86
started continuing my trolling in chat

334.199 --> 341.43
and it wasn't good but just this guy you

337.86 --> 343.969
know he pisses me off because he is

341.43 --> 347.94
acting like such a pathologic

343.969 --> 351.659
pathological liar really terrible and

347.94 --> 352.08
it's just the tone he uses while doing

351.659 --> 355.65
it

352.08 --> 357.50899999999996
makes it quite unbearable like when

355.65 --> 359.50899999999996
Ralph does does that thing and he does

357.509 --> 362.219
it all the time it's kind of funny you

359.509 --> 364.62
know I can tolerate that for a while

362.219 --> 370.159
because it's just funny how he does it

364.62 --> 372.93
is more amusing small ways to take that

370.159 --> 375.96
you can take it for comedic value but

372.93 --> 381.49
Tim is just there it's just so

375.96 --> 383.46999999999997
disgusting yeah can't stand that guy

381.49 --> 387.49
yeah and I know I'm not gonna put a

383.47 --> 389.35
spell on him thank you and he spell I

387.49 --> 392.77
put on people as the truth

389.35 --> 396.03900000000004
it's my hardcore uncensored observations

392.77 --> 399.46
and analysis that's the spells that I

396.039 --> 405.729
put on people right spell the truth it's

399.46 --> 406.9
a dis spell so no I don't need to put

405.729 --> 411.15
any spell on him

406.9 --> 415.33
I'm just trying my best to basically

411.15 --> 418.479
force to hold a mirror in his face in

415.33 --> 421.57
between his own mirror reflection which

418.479 --> 423.82
he loves to just talk to and declare

421.57 --> 427.33
victory and declare all these lies and

423.82 --> 430.9
delusions on our side and wallow in his

427.33 --> 433.479
own victory like a total jack off and I

430.9 --> 437.349
am basically trying to force a mirror in

433.479 --> 439.539
between that and leak through aspects of

437.349 --> 442.63
his character that are showing that

439.539 --> 449.46999999999997
everyone is seeing and forcing that into

442.63 --> 452.65
his consciousness and yeah it's quite

449.47 --> 455.44000000000005
aggressive but that's how that works

452.65 --> 457.57
when people are completely deluded

455.44 --> 461.11
they are hiding and you need to get into

457.57 --> 463.479
that hiding place and basically force

461.11 --> 466.91900000000004
open a window shine a light on the

463.479 --> 468.909
vampire so the shadow can burn away

466.919 --> 471.279
that's how it works

468.909 --> 476.139
metaphoric

471.279 --> 480.749
yeah no no spells hell why don't be

476.139 --> 480.749
silly it's not funny

481.799 --> 487.74899999999997
look spells in the technical sense are

485.049 --> 492.06899999999996
illusions and those are routed in lies

487.749 --> 499.439
and that I don't do that okay I don't

492.069 --> 499.439
need to do that I do drag people into

499.589 --> 506.61899999999997
imaginary constructs conceptualizing but

503.919 --> 509.10999999999996
I'm very open about it I don't pretend

506.619 --> 513.219
something is real when I'm not certain

509.11 --> 515.8290000000001
that it is I just see the possibilities

513.219 --> 519.25
and that is not a spell that is not a

515.829 --> 524.7399999999999
lie that is just building you could call

519.25 --> 526.93
it wizardry if you like but no it's not

524.74 --> 530.879
casting a spell thank you very much I

526.93 --> 530.8789999999999
don't need to do that I don't do that

533.34 --> 539.27
No

535.07 --> 543.37
it's much more useful to just focus on

539.27 --> 545.87
what you want what you want to change in

543.37 --> 550.01
observing the dynamics of things and

545.87 --> 554.33
then seeing how can you apply a change

550.01 --> 558.41
for the better and make that your

554.33 --> 560.21
instinctive focus and just try to keep

558.41 --> 565.9699999999999
control over yourself in order to

560.21 --> 568.07
achieve that and yeah I think that's a

565.97 --> 571.9100000000001
much more effective way of approach than

568.07 --> 574.2800000000001
just I don't know dragging a bunch of it

571.91 --> 578.4499999999999
ethereal stuff in it or spirits or

574.28 --> 581.0899999999999
whatever and doing a ritual to help let

578.45 --> 581.72
them help out or however that's supposed

581.09 --> 586.46
to work

581.72 --> 590.21
no thank you I know I'd rather just do

586.46 --> 593.45
delve into the actual material and the

590.21 --> 597.44
ethereal strands of yeah the other layer

593.45 --> 599.8900000000001
of reality I'd rather just do that it's

597.44 --> 602.75
right the working directory

599.89 --> 607.74
then at least yeah you don't have to

602.75 --> 612.03
trust any vague entity you know

607.74 --> 616.5600000000001
so many warnings about that and in my

612.03 --> 619.89
opinion that is also a big risk of pagan

616.56 --> 623.2399999999999
it's religion as well because I don't

619.89 --> 627.03
mind any of it but it is when you become

623.24 --> 629.04
when you entangle yourself with dark

627.03 --> 632.67
deeds and when you integral yourself

629.04 --> 636.78
with spirits with promises and oaths and

632.67 --> 639.81
all that or when you worship a spirit or

636.78 --> 644.52
a God or God you think is a spirit that

639.81 --> 648.75
kind of thing that is all dangerous it

644.52 --> 651.66
is technically dangerous because even

648.75 --> 654.72
though your belief may guide your path

651.66 --> 658.9399999999999
pretty straight according to that path

654.72 --> 661.89
system that yet the way you do it

658.94 --> 665.9100000000001
doesn't mean that all these things are

661.89 --> 669.96
actually what you think they are it is

665.91 --> 672.99
almost like spiritual scientism you

669.96 --> 675.51
think through a spiritual structure with

672.99 --> 678.63
these entities but how do you even

675.51 --> 680.91
confirm that these entities are that or

678.63 --> 685.74
that the thing that you've learned is

680.91 --> 688.5
really what they are all that it's

685.74 --> 693.44
complicated and a person can be fooled

688.5 --> 693.44
even in the other dimension I

695.19 --> 704.25
time several things it's very confusing

699.75 --> 708.85
so spirits and all that dealing with

704.25 --> 711.519
spirits is just no don't do that

708.85 --> 717.399
you know family spirits that's another

711.519 --> 721.87
matter but always be careful oh just no

717.399 --> 726.399
no magic like that's not that thing I

721.87 --> 731.04
don't do that but yeah just seeing

726.399 --> 734.019
things and working with what's there

731.04 --> 738.49
works much better why would you need

734.019 --> 742.0
some external thing to do something for

738.49 --> 745.529
you when you could do it yourself by

742.0 --> 745.529
just learning what you're dealing with

748.74 --> 757.62
so yeah happy New Year to everyone in

752.92 --> 757.62
Asia and in Australia

761.109 --> 770.98
ten hours from now it's gonna be

765.29 --> 770.98
midnight here as well take a while still

772.5 --> 776.16
yeah what am i doing New Year's Eve yeah

774.75 --> 782.18
I'm gonna be chilling everything's gonna

776.16 --> 787.35
be close I'm stocked up on the green

782.18 --> 793.56
enough food and oh yeah looking forward

787.35 --> 795.39
to new sweaters I hope I think they're

793.56 --> 799.1099999999999
gonna be pretty much identical to this

795.39 --> 802.53
one except for the giant holes so yeah

799.11 --> 805.38
looking forward to that a lot so for me

802.53 --> 809.12
yeah that's kind of been my Christmas

805.38 --> 812.67
present I guess from my stepmother and

809.12 --> 821.42
what quite moved by it I didn't expect

812.67 --> 821.42
it at all but yeah awesome he's awesome

823.04 --> 831.199
I guess I do stuff for her as well like

828.709 --> 834.709
I I would have to she's such a wonderful

831.199 --> 842.66
person and she's such a busy bee it's a

834.709 --> 846.0089999999999
really hard worker networker she's like

842.66 --> 848.029
in organizing things being part of

846.009 --> 851.72
conferences that kind of thing

848.029 --> 858.05
a lot it's like and yes so I gave her a

851.72 --> 860.1800000000001
really good shoulder massage and some

858.05 --> 862.5999999999999
interaction with her dogs and as well as

860.18 --> 869.5089999999999
she always has dogs and all of those

862.6 --> 874.13
very special dogs and yeah so I do

869.509 --> 877.1
something back at least besides just

874.13 --> 880.579
also this is kind of a thing look I've

877.1 --> 884.089
seen pretty bad times and I would always

880.579 --> 886.279
tend to just throw that out in front of

884.089 --> 889.1
my closest family in front of the people

886.279 --> 891.41
that I know really know me like my dad

889.1 --> 894.139
and my stepfather as well because I do

891.41 --> 897.769
trust her she's proven that so many

894.139 --> 904.1800000000001
times so when I'm just doing good and

897.769 --> 907.13
when my view my path is clear to me that

904.18 --> 909.9799999999999
makes them very happy now I still feel

907.13 --> 910.68
like oh my god they've done so much for

909.98 --> 916.96
me I

910.68 --> 920.01
I wish I could do more back but yeah

916.96 --> 923.5300000000001
it'll come that time when I can really

920.01 --> 927.36
do more back

923.53 --> 927.36
he'll come I trust that

927.47 --> 932.8100000000001
but yeah as long as I'm just happy and

930.23 --> 935.1800000000001
doing good they're very happy about that

932.81 --> 936.68
because they've seen me a lot worse and

935.18 --> 941.2099999999999
they're just really glad that I seemed

936.68 --> 945.16
to be in an upward climb in a part in

941.21 --> 950.0500000000001
this part of my life after so much

945.16 --> 953.63
dredging around in [ __ ] and hatred

950.05 --> 957.9499999999999
myself and frustration towards the world

953.63 --> 959.27
and where all that crap so yeah things

957.95 --> 964.97
are doing better things are going to be

959.27 --> 969.1999999999999
better this year they're probably also

964.97 --> 971.95
going to be a little more tense from

969.2 --> 971.95
many angles

974.25 --> 980.61
and yeah flat earth I got this really

977.91 --> 985.4399999999999
really odd sensation really odd

980.61 --> 987.21
sensation that much of our heritage of

985.44 --> 989.5100000000001
what we've been doing in the Flat Earth

987.21 --> 992.07
movement what I've been doing about

989.51 --> 995.49
conceptualizing the holographic globe of

992.07 --> 1000.44
the heavens for example I think that

995.49 --> 1003.71
level of thinking is now entering the

1000.44 --> 1006.6800000000001
sub mainstream the alternative media

1003.71 --> 1010.52
because I'm seeing signs of this it's

1006.68 --> 1012.68
just popping up and not yet not just in

1010.52 --> 1013.91
a flat earth movement they it's very

1012.68 --> 1016.12
interesting because they're

1013.91 --> 1020.63
conceptualized thinking about things

1016.12 --> 1023.69
without as I kind of suggested two years

1020.63 --> 1029.23
ago without talking about Flat Earth and

1023.69 --> 1032.45
that's very smart of them and almost

1029.23 --> 1034.34
thinking like could I do something with

1032.45 --> 1037.04
that could I do something

1034.34 --> 1040.6399999999999
because I'd love to try out the

1037.04 --> 1042.3799999999999
alternative media you could call it a

1040.64 --> 1044.39
nut shop or you could call it a notch

1042.38 --> 1048.5600000000002
down because yeah money now gets

1044.39 --> 1051.43
involved and so the contractual

1048.56 --> 1054.6799999999998
obligation crap that kind of thing so

1051.43 --> 1056.69
I'm not in a hurry but it is kind of

1054.68 --> 1060.98
cool and I think there's gonna be more

1056.69 --> 1064.3
office more conceptualized thinking

1060.98 --> 1067.13
outside of heliocentric modeling and

1064.3 --> 1072.98
it's gonna be experimental it's gonna

1067.13 --> 1077.99
open up people's minds in just in the

1072.98 --> 1081.56
art of world building and conceptualize

1077.99 --> 1084.38
design and hey look the world through

1081.56 --> 1089.45
games through gamers for game designers

1084.38 --> 1092.2600000000002
through 3d designers is already in need

1089.45 --> 1095.15
of many people that are good at that

1092.26 --> 1098.9
conceptualizing designing world building

1095.15 --> 1102.3200000000002
in a bigger picture kind of way so yeah

1098.9 --> 1106.3100000000002
there also is a growing market for this

1102.32 --> 1108.23
kind of thinking not necessarily the

1106.31 --> 1112.6399999999999
flatter flatter flatter until NASA and

1108.23 --> 1116.93
the NASA but just the broader thinking

1112.64 --> 1121.97
of physics and of geology and of how

1116.93 --> 1124.13
things could have come to be of well you

1121.97 --> 1127.31
could use this like I use it in my games

1124.13 --> 1129.47
to create creation mythologies for

1127.31 --> 1132.53
separate worlds for fantasy world

1129.47 --> 1135.5
fiction worlds or alternative history

1132.53 --> 1138.36
concepts so many things you can do with

1135.5 --> 1141.779
just conceptualizing about all of the

1138.36 --> 1145.08
make interesting world concepts and yeah

1141.779 --> 1147.32
game designers will welcome this because

1145.08 --> 1152.01
it brings new options new

1147.32 --> 1154.83
experimentations with it that yeah that

1152.01 --> 1157.2
is just good for people to delve into it

1154.83 --> 1159.539
so I think there's gonna be more of this

1157.2 --> 1163.89
there might even be games that are start

1159.539 --> 1167.82
to embrace aspects of either flat earth

1163.89 --> 1171.8890000000001
or looping models or the holographic sky

1167.82 --> 1180.4399999999998
concept a new I conceptualize the idea

1171.889 --> 1183.01
for example let's just say that

1180.44 --> 1186.17
people will start to from a heliocentric

1183.01 --> 1186.83
perspective think and be told that yeah

1186.17 --> 1189.77
maybe

1186.83 --> 1193.37
the skies are holographic and some kind

1189.77 --> 1198.44
of way so that the other worlds out

1193.37 --> 1201.77
there are different they yeah the

1198.44 --> 1204.44
embrace of certain holographic elements

1201.77 --> 1206.84
maybe it will be said eventually that

1204.44 --> 1208.88
the moon is holographic but that the

1206.84 --> 1212.8999999999999
planets are still real in the center

1208.88 --> 1215.0300000000002
still real and it might migrate on who

1212.9 --> 1217.25
knows maybe eventually it will be said

1215.03 --> 1219.53
that indeed the whole globe of the

1217.25 --> 1222.71
heavens all of it is holographic but

1219.53 --> 1228.08
that beyond that there must still be in

1222.71 --> 1229.94
other worlds up there yeah and all the

1228.08 --> 1232.6699999999998
while you could always leave out the

1229.94 --> 1236.0800000000002
geometric nature of the world whether it

1232.67 --> 1238.5500000000002
be flat well you can leave it out and

1236.08 --> 1243.32
not trigger a lot of people in the

1238.55 --> 1244.6399999999999
process and yeah I think that is gonna

1243.32 --> 1248.8
happen that's my prediction

1244.64 --> 1248.8000000000002
that's gonna happen a lot in 2019

1251.72 --> 1257.52
hmm

1254.42 --> 1263.64
hopefully I also will reach my thousand

1257.52 --> 1266.1
subscribers that will be good and I

1263.64 --> 1268.0800000000002
think I will I think I hope I will

1266.1 --> 1270.27
pretty soon I hope I will before my

1268.08 --> 1273.3
birthday in February that would be

1270.27 --> 1277.5
really nice birthday present from the

1273.3 --> 1280.5
viewers and my subscribers so yeah if

1277.5 --> 1285.559
you know any other people that might be

1280.5 --> 1288.45
interested in a guy like me and my show

1285.559 --> 1292.6789999999999
things that I talk about in the way that

1288.45 --> 1295.65
I talk about it and well my rectangular

1292.679 --> 1299.8200000000002
looping model then please share the show

1295.65 --> 1305.25
with them maybe you have a bit of a

1299.82 --> 1308.37
personal intro to yeah it's good if they

1305.25 --> 1310.77
know about Flat Earth at least some of

1308.37 --> 1312.559
it before they touch upon the show

1310.77 --> 1314.91
otherwise you're gonna be like what

1312.559 --> 1317.309
suddenly Flat Earth pops out of nowhere

1314.91 --> 1320.16
and of course it is in the title but

1317.309 --> 1322.02
yeah one that doesn't know my channel

1320.16 --> 1325.23
could assume that I'm just doing it to

1322.02 --> 1328.98
grab attention and not realize that it's

1325.23 --> 1331.5
actually for real so yeah that can

1328.98 --> 1334.32
happen all these things can happen but

1331.5 --> 1337.5
please share my show and help me expand

1334.32 --> 1340.02
my subscriber base and also float the

1337.5 --> 1342.73
video if you like

1340.02 --> 1343.71
so let's see was in chat it's pretty

1342.73 --> 1348.07
busy

1343.71 --> 1351.8400000000001
stop mr. Raikes J Mack Sean Pierce

1348.07 --> 1356.1899999999998
Roger MC some trafficking arrests a hat

1351.84 --> 1360.76
Sparky Lee JJ

1356.19 --> 1370.95
Daniel fields Hellboy simulation dweller

1360.76 --> 1370.95
the rigged with with Jose JG Gonzalez

1372.24 --> 1375.619
Mark's my dear

1376.56 --> 1383.79
truth-seeker mafia and 36 David Reed

1385.86 --> 1391.54
monitor all goody

1388.32 --> 1391.54
[Music]

1399.419 --> 1409.259
right okay weird questions about magic

1404.599 --> 1413.329
from Hellboy dollars has no true magic

1409.259 --> 1413.329
have to swear enough well

1415.99 --> 1419.16
I don't know

1420.69 --> 1427.05
there are rules about it that's the

1424.71 --> 1431.31
thing because nothing you do is without

1427.05 --> 1433.68
consequences with the actual

1431.31 --> 1437.06
extra-dimensional interference kind of

1433.68 --> 1437.0600000000002
thing and

1439.66 --> 1442.3200000000002
yeah

1444.87 --> 1452.6699999999998
it pretty much comes down to ya only use

1448.53 --> 1455.85
it when absolutely necessary and that's

1452.67 --> 1460.28
by the way with all kind of power in

1455.85 --> 1463.5
every factor that is always better

1460.28 --> 1467.19
because lots of power tends to disrupt a

1463.5 --> 1467.79
lot or destroy a lot or radically change

1467.19 --> 1472.2
a lot

1467.79 --> 1479.12
so always don't overdo it that's pretty

1472.2 --> 1479.1200000000001
much it so

1488.27 --> 1492.58
hello a Randi flutters

1495.36 --> 1498.59
a JM

1500.65 --> 1503.7900000000002
yeah it's good

1503.94 --> 1511.5
yeah anything is still on hold

1507.32 --> 1514.8899999999999
so yeah I will continue on the show at

1511.5 --> 1517.08
least another half hour but yeah if you

1514.89 --> 1519.0
guys want this show to be a little bit

1517.08 --> 1522.6599999999999
longer than that then I'm gonna have to

1519.0 --> 1527.61
have panel members to join me otherwise

1522.66 --> 1530.91
yeah it's not I'm not gonna be gonna be

1527.61 --> 1535.2299999999998
talking for three hours by myself

1530.91 --> 1538.25
that's no I'll get tired out with way

1535.23 --> 1538.25
before that happened

1548.6 --> 1551.4099999999999
all right

1561.37 --> 1565.8999999999999
and I've got so many windows open

1563.11 --> 1568.4399999999998
there's OBS thing it's you really get

1565.9 --> 1568.44
lost in this

1570.509 --> 1575.519
all right okay rent says you'll be back

1573.239 --> 1576.8890000000001
in 30 minutes you might come on yeah

1575.519 --> 1580.259
sure

1576.889 --> 1583.589
that'll be cool anyone else who wants to

1580.259 --> 1584.909
join you know what to do contact me on

1583.589 --> 1589.559
skype the address is in the description

1584.909 --> 1592.679
box in the youtube video below and yeah

1589.559 --> 1596.9089999999999
talk to me on skype and that way I can

1592.679 --> 1599.239
send you a hangout link if I think I

1596.909 --> 1599.239
should

1606.47 --> 1612.53
I think Walz is probably busy getting

1609.62 --> 1614.83
drunk and lighting fireworks at the

1612.53 --> 1614.83
moment

1616.41 --> 1620.0
I know flutters ginger

1625.57 --> 1635.9189999999999
yeah thanks all of you for being here in

1629.729 --> 1638.95
this last show of 2018 it's kind of

1635.919 --> 1642.3400000000001
ironic isn't it that this is episode 52

1638.95 --> 1644.6390000000001
and that is it's the last episode of the

1642.34 --> 1648.4789999999998
year since there are 52 weeks in a year

1644.639 --> 1648.4789999999998
it's kind of funny isn't it

1658.78 --> 1664.059
I'm not lighting any fireworks myself

1661.57 --> 1667.6789999999999
right away it's like like I would have

1664.059 --> 1672.22
to hear in a relatively big city

1667.679 --> 1676.299
everyone goes nuts with fireworks during

1672.22 --> 1679.51
the New Year celebration so now I'll

1676.299 --> 1681.4
just stand here on the roof hope there's

1679.51 --> 1685.36
no fireworks being the little right next

1681.4 --> 1688.659
to the building because then yeah things

1685.36 --> 1690.549
might explode pretty close to me I don't

1688.659 --> 1695.7990000000002
think that's gonna happen so just have a

1690.549 --> 1697.96
great all over the place and yeah who

1695.799 --> 1700.51
knows I might do it if it's not too

1697.96 --> 1702.73
smoky it's not too cloudy I might do

1700.51 --> 1705.1589999999999
another New Year's video just like it

1702.73 --> 1705.909
did last year so yeah dude check that

1705.159 --> 1707.8300000000002
one out

1705.909 --> 1710.8600000000001
you know what I'll actually look it up

1707.83 --> 1719.6399999999999
and put a link to that video in the

1710.86 --> 1719.6399999999999
description I mean in the in the chat

1720.27 --> 1723.9
take for a moment

1727.35 --> 1732.1399999999999
and all these flatter three birds

1736.85 --> 1740.78
easily recognizable

1746.23 --> 1750.06
oh yeah yeah

1752.13 --> 1762.39
yeah check out my fireworks video from

1754.799 --> 1765.289
last year so they would like for for 400

1762.39 --> 1765.289
minutes and a quarter

1767.47 --> 1774.27
noranti that is not Legolas as well

1771.13 --> 1774.2700000000002
that's my bow

1782.42 --> 1786.25
yeah it's a real bow by the way

1806.81 --> 1809.81
this

1815.51 --> 1826.46
so pretty good one very old model

1820.84 --> 1829.6399999999999
composite bow know what sports technical

1826.46 --> 1831.83
[ __ ] so it's pure intuition and it's

1829.64 --> 1834.65
very stable I've used it it's very

1831.83 --> 1837.4099999999999
strong minutes maybe actually a little

1834.65 --> 1839.17
bit too strong for me I to be able to

1837.41 --> 1842.8700000000001
use it

1839.17 --> 1844.79
in sequence I probably have to do some

1842.87 --> 1847.9599999999998
more muscle training in advance at least

1844.79 --> 1847.96
like lil

1876.39 --> 1884.179
yeah yeah the thing about Bo's ranty is

1880.429 --> 1889.17
you can have several strengths of both

1884.179 --> 1892.47
how much drink you need it to exert in

1889.17 --> 1894.39
order to yeah to shoot it and the

1892.47 --> 1897.84
stronger is the more power the arrow

1894.39 --> 1900.24
will have that's the thing about it now

1897.84 --> 1904.08
I also have another bow is actually a

1900.24 --> 1906.48
white bow which was a LARP oh and that's

1904.08 --> 1910.6499999999999
not a powerful bow at all it's not even

1906.48 --> 1912.84
half strength so I can just do that with

1910.65 --> 1916.1100000000001
one finger without a problem with that

1912.84 --> 1918.78
one but yeah it's mostly just launched

1916.11 --> 1922.4699999999998
things because it's not gonna be having

1918.78 --> 1927.6
a lot of power so hey I have a guest Red

1922.47 --> 1932.94
Hen radio oh cool

1927.6 --> 1934.6499999999999
thanks for joining yeah yeah I'm just

1932.94 --> 1936.8700000000001
I'm just gonna be on mute for a minute

1934.65 --> 1943.919
cuz I got to get out of the apartment

1936.87 --> 1945.2399999999998
haha I just don't want to hear I don't

1943.919 --> 1946.8600000000001
want what I want you to hear all of my

1945.24 --> 1949.79
getting ready noises so just hold on

1946.86 --> 1949.79
alright

1955.32 --> 1959.57
so

1957.23 --> 1962.179
yeah by the way how is my sound I know

1959.57 --> 1964.37
it's a bit scratchy still I'm gonna have

1962.179 --> 1968.74
to work on that another thing I'm gonna

1964.37 --> 1973.6689999999999
have to fix in 2090 as well as the

1968.74 --> 1976.76
getting the title card and everything

1973.669 --> 1979.429
and the intro ready yeah matter of

1976.76 --> 1981.97
getting that title card and I got it

1979.429 --> 1981.97
and

1986.16 --> 1989.75
now I lost my train of thought

1995.17 --> 2000.51
anyway yeah that's one thing I need to

1997.9 --> 2006.66
do fix the show up a little bit more

2000.51 --> 2009.6
with more and yeah getting get a good

2006.66 --> 2013.3400000000001
show go I really do hope though that

2009.6 --> 2015.99
Flat Earth debates will be back cause

2013.34 --> 2020.97
because it's gone now there is like a

2015.99 --> 2023.49
pressure everywhere at role pressure we

2020.97 --> 2027.47
need some we need a troll lightning rod

2023.49 --> 2027.47
again Nathan please come back

2041.44 --> 2049.75
am i right grantie it's a good question

2044.07 --> 2053.23
the thing is a lot it's what I just said

2049.75 --> 2057.79
look there's a real serious problem with

2053.23 --> 2061.27
the globe in humans it's it's more than

2057.79 --> 2065.2599999999998
just standards religious indoctrination

2061.27 --> 2068.47
really it is more than that it is it was

2065.26 --> 2072.6400000000003
built to stick like a curse

2068.47 --> 2076.6299999999997
it sounds really bizarre but and as I

2072.64 --> 2079.5099999999998
said there's gonna be some mainstream

2076.63 --> 2082.03
the alternative media is gonna delve

2079.51 --> 2085.21
into conceptual cosmogony

2082.03 --> 2087.3700000000003
but leaving the flat aspect out of it

2085.21 --> 2093.04
out of it that's what I think is gonna

2087.37 --> 2095.8599999999997
happen more and more so people will

2093.04 --> 2099.85
probably still remain divided about Flat

2095.86 --> 2103.27
Earth non Flat Earth but the flat aspect

2099.85 --> 2105.94
is gonna take a secondary position in

2103.27 --> 2109.0
just figuring out what is up there

2105.94 --> 2111.16
mostly because that is the big question

2109.0 --> 2114.16
that is the big replacement question for

2111.16 --> 2119.0699999999997
the outer space which is the greatest

2114.16 --> 2124.27
loss and requires the replacement

2119.07 --> 2127.1800000000003
culturally somehow or a transformation

2124.27 --> 2129.46
as I have imagined it a transformation

2127.18 --> 2132.46
where it is just science fiction and

2129.46 --> 2136.15
like a continuous storytelling will

2132.46 --> 2138.04
continue on like a storytelling Gil the

2136.15 --> 2141.76
science fiction guild just keep on doing

2138.04 --> 2145.33
what it does but admittedly as science

2141.76 --> 2147.8500000000004
fiction but according to principles that

2145.33 --> 2149.22
kind of thing that is what I hope it'll

2147.85 --> 2152.31
end up with

2149.22 --> 2158.18
but it's it's never gonna really go away

2152.31 --> 2161.5499999999997
entirely not really I doubt that so much

2158.18 --> 2164.3689999999997
yeah maybe people are gonna hate it on

2161.55 --> 2166.8300000000004
it especially because of the lie and

2164.369 --> 2170.52
many people are not as philosophically

2166.83 --> 2172.56
deep or disciplined or spiritual to

2170.52 --> 2177.54
realize it and they may just start to

2172.56 --> 2179.25
hate it and yeah just like we want to

2177.54 --> 2182.16
get rid of it anything globe must go

2179.25 --> 2186.24
that kind of [ __ ] but who's that gonna

2182.16 --> 2189.45
be good for really I don't know it's

2186.24 --> 2194.25
just the way I see it through

2189.45 --> 2196.9199999999996
libertarian conceptualization is you do

2194.25 --> 2200.25
things with your family in your kids how

2196.92 --> 2202.92
you see it and you leave others alone

2200.25 --> 2205.349
you can express your opinion but you

2202.92 --> 2207.9
can't force it on somebody else so if

2205.349 --> 2210.09
somebody wants to raise their kid with

2207.9 --> 2211.44
the globe and space and science fiction

2210.09 --> 2214.4700000000003
and maybe one day you will be an

2211.44 --> 2216.089
astronaut then it is up to them and also

2214.47 --> 2219.3799999999997
up to them to account for the

2216.089 --> 2222.119
consequences once they figure out and

2219.38 --> 2226.02
inevitably through contact with the rest

2222.119 --> 2228.9
of the world that it's alive so do it

2226.02 --> 2231.57
just like Santa Claus you know some

2228.9 --> 2233.099
people do enough to teach their kids

2231.57 --> 2235.349
about Santa Claus and then when they

2233.099 --> 2237.81
drop they tell me it's a lie and yeah

2235.349 --> 2241.349
some kids are really pissed off to their

2237.81 --> 2244.5
parents about it tiny but it's the same

2241.349 --> 2247.44
thing and I think that is what the

2244.5 --> 2251.43
science fiction heliocentrism universe

2247.44 --> 2256.81
should be treated it as another cultural

2251.43 --> 2261.7599999999998
creation another fantasy story

2256.81 --> 2264.94
that can be yeah can be put on a child

2261.76 --> 2267.3700000000003
as a as a fairytale story that they will

2264.94 --> 2269.7400000000002
believe is is real when they're young

2267.37 --> 2273.7
that kind of thing it's it's up to each

2269.74 --> 2277.6299999999997
individual in my opinion

2273.7 --> 2281.56
what I find interesting is the the

2277.63 --> 2284.65
antagonism toward indoctrination in this

2281.56 --> 2286.39
discussion because I've heard someone

2284.65 --> 2289.39
say to the you know to a certain extent

2286.39 --> 2291.16
I'm just going to raise my kids to you

2289.39 --> 2295.66
know be free to make their own decisions

2291.16 --> 2298.45
well that in and of itself is a form of

2295.66 --> 2301.33
indoctrination because your training and

2298.45 --> 2304.24
teaching the child how to think how to

2301.33 --> 2306.39
behave how to believe so you can't get

2304.24 --> 2308.9199999999996
away from indoctrination the issue is

2306.39 --> 2314.97
what we're going to indoctrinate our

2308.92 --> 2318.75
children with well hopefully honest and

2314.97 --> 2321.6699999999996
sharp deep answers to their questions

2318.75 --> 2323.47
sure that is the only way they can

2321.67 --> 2326.35
really learn about it otherwise it's

2323.47 --> 2327.97
just gonna be forced on them no I agree

2326.35 --> 2329.95
I agree the thing that I'm trying to

2327.97 --> 2332.08
bring up is the fact that they that it

2329.95 --> 2333.7599999999998
seems even though they're not saying it

2332.08 --> 2336.12
it seems as though they're saying I'm

2333.76 --> 2340.3
not going to indoctrinate my child and

2336.12 --> 2343.02
the reality is yeah you are you're just

2340.3 --> 2345.9700000000003
doing it your way well the thing about

2343.02 --> 2348.34
indoctrination is that if you have been

2345.97 --> 2351.43
indoctrinated in some way and it can

2348.34 --> 2354.88
even happen accidentally when it's not

2351.43 --> 2356.71
really necessary then as long as you are

2354.88 --> 2359.65
indoctrinated it's a great likelihood

2356.71 --> 2362.7
that you will copy that indoctrination

2359.65 --> 2365.86
onto others without even realizing it

2362.7 --> 2369.52
right well that's the nature I think

2365.86 --> 2372.3700000000003
that's the nature of of our species I

2369.52 --> 2378.41
think that's the nature of our of who we

2372.37 --> 2379.91
are is as yes humans it's yeah

2378.41 --> 2384.2
yeah I mean you know it's the whole

2379.91 --> 2387.17
nature-nurture idea also yeah but also

2384.2 --> 2391.85
just providing a platform of energy and

2387.17 --> 2397.37
rules for spirits to work in together it

2391.85 --> 2399.11
does create a bond as does religion as

2397.37 --> 2401.9
does this group thing

2399.11 --> 2405.2000000000003
but yeah well taken away in the process

2401.9 --> 2406.88
that's the question yeah and I think to

2405.2 --> 2408.71
again I what I would like to say because

2406.88 --> 2410.4500000000003
I am religious I come from that

2408.71 --> 2411.95
background so I have a certain bias

2410.45 --> 2415.3399999999997
toward it and I'm not trying to push a

2411.95 --> 2419.5699999999997
particular discussion necessarily but

2415.34 --> 2423.1400000000003
the whole the whole negative reaction

2419.57 --> 2425.51
against a religious indoctrination you

2423.14 --> 2426.7999999999997
again you can't get away from that so if

2425.51 --> 2428.86
you're if you're raising your child

2426.8 --> 2434.03
Buddhist if you're raising your child

2428.86 --> 2438.07
Shinto or Christian or whatever you're

2434.03 --> 2441.71
going to train them how to think as that

2438.07 --> 2444.4100000000003
construct that it's inevitable it's not

2441.71 --> 2446.9900000000002
it's not good or bad per se I mean

2444.41 --> 2452.3599999999997
unless you've got you know a Jim Jones

2446.99 --> 2455.4199999999996
cult where he kind of have to disagree

2452.36 --> 2459.23
because you are providing them a certain

2455.42 --> 2461.39
structure and they may test it out but

2459.23 --> 2464.03
that doesn't mean that that will shape

2461.39 --> 2466.79
them entirely it will just provide them

2464.03 --> 2468.2000000000003
certain tools that they will have access

2466.79 --> 2470.96
to the rest of their lives but it

2468.2 --> 2472.6699999999996
doesn't mean that they will be exactly

2470.96 --> 2476.36
like a Buddhist that they will become

2472.67 --> 2478.85
obsessed by that it's just the path they

2476.36 --> 2483.08
took in learning about the greater world

2478.85 --> 2484.91
as they grew up and yeah I too you know

2483.08 --> 2486.5299999999997
whatever you're confronted with you'll

2484.91 --> 2488.21
learn about it you learn something about

2486.53 --> 2490.34
this you learn something about that

2488.21 --> 2493.25
all the religions and that is how I

2490.34 --> 2497.11
basically scraped everything that I

2493.25 --> 2500.44
trust now together it's

2497.11 --> 2502.75
yeah really matter how your erase it it

2500.44 --> 2505.75
matters more the type of conditioning

2502.75 --> 2508.51
that happens like how are things

2505.75 --> 2511.27
punished and what energy levels are

2508.51 --> 2513.0400000000004
present during that entire period that

2511.27 --> 2518.14
is of much more influence than the

2513.04 --> 2522.82
actual religion or narrative that is

2518.14 --> 2524.5299999999997
used even yeah it's it's user friendly

2522.82 --> 2528.4300000000003
to a certain extent because if you take

2524.53 --> 2530.5
ten people and you observe these ten

2528.43 --> 2534.49
people being raised from from childhood

2530.5 --> 2538.93
until adulthood and you then observed

2534.49 --> 2540.2799999999997
what what path they chose by the time

2538.93 --> 2543.3999999999996
they were adults you're gonna get

2540.28 --> 2547.0600000000004
divergent expressions even though they

2543.4 --> 2549.01
were all raised in the same societal

2547.06 --> 2550.9
structure and let's just say you know

2549.01 --> 2553.5600000000004
just if we want to make it broad so I

2550.9 --> 2557.26
agree with you in terms of you know

2553.56 --> 2560.71
someone not necessarily becoming a full

2557.26 --> 2564.3700000000003
expression of that particular construct

2560.71 --> 2567.79
everybody's going to express themselves

2564.37 --> 2569.3199999999997
differently yeah and and I think that

2567.79 --> 2571.15
that's where we have to have that

2569.32 --> 2574.1200000000003
attitude what you were saying earlier

2571.15 --> 2575.7400000000002
about raising a family you know and

2574.12 --> 2577.54
saying well that's not how I would raise

2575.74 --> 2579.7799999999997
my family oh that's that's fine that's

2577.54 --> 2582.79
great and just as long as you don't

2579.78 --> 2585.4300000000003
necessarily come down on me because I'm

2582.79 --> 2590.95
raising them as a Christian because of

2585.43 --> 2594.91
course right right but let me tell you

2590.95 --> 2597.6099999999997
that if I get kids then at a certain age

2594.91 --> 2600.67
I will definitely confront them with the

2597.61 --> 2604.42
Bible as well probably probably more in

2600.67 --> 2606.16
depth than I will over the course of

2604.42 --> 2608.62
their life with all the religions

2606.16 --> 2612.0099999999998
because I have more affinity to it

2608.62 --> 2614.98
myself so I'll try to get more in depth

2612.01 --> 2616.75
and just see if it touches them as well

2614.98 --> 2619.48
or if there's some kind of societal

2616.75 --> 2621.01
indoctrination I need to help them get

2619.48 --> 2624.609
out of the way in order to for them to

2621.01 --> 2628.6600000000003
really learn what it is okay now I would

2624.609 --> 2634.39
I will say that I came to a crossroads

2628.66 --> 2637.7999999999997
in my own development when I was going

2634.39 --> 2642.19
to seminary to train to be a minister

2637.8 --> 2647.8
and there were certainly there were

2642.19 --> 2652.06
certain theological dogmas in my

2647.8 --> 2654.55
tradition that I started to squint at I

2652.06 --> 2658.18
started to look at from a different

2654.55 --> 2662.4300000000003
perspective and I knew that I had to toe

2658.18 --> 2662.43
the line if I wanted to get my papers

2663.0 --> 2668.47
yeah you know yes you know there so it

2666.43 --> 2669.97
all depends on where you're at you know

2668.47 --> 2671.3489999999997
in terms of a family you might have

2669.97 --> 2673.99
someone that's Amish and they're like

2671.349 --> 2675.46
you know look it's it's our it's our way

2673.99 --> 2677.2299999999996
or the highway and you've got to decide

2675.46 --> 2678.9700000000003
to toe the line or not and then you've

2677.23 --> 2680.17
got other families that are like no you

2678.97 --> 2685.0499999999997
know what if you don't want to do this

2680.17 --> 2685.05
that's fine that's alright yep

2685.39 --> 2689.83
yeah it's free but the other thing that

2688.12 --> 2692.3199999999997
I tried to do I could try to

2689.83 --> 2695.3199999999997
intentionally when I was a teacher in

2692.32 --> 2699.19
Christian schools taught for about four

2695.32 --> 2702.1600000000003
years I I started my school year off and

2699.19 --> 2704.23
tried to reinforce this as much as I

2702.16 --> 2706.5099999999998
could by saying to the students this

2704.23 --> 2709.0
this classroom here right now for you as

2706.51 --> 2712.1200000000003
a safe place because this is where you

2709.0 --> 2715.3
can ask all of those questions that you

2712.12 --> 2717.3399999999997
don't want to ask because you're afraid

2715.3 --> 2720.55
you won't be shamed for your questions

2717.34 --> 2722.02
right I tried I tried to push that as

2720.55 --> 2724.6800000000003
much as I could so that we could have

2722.02 --> 2727.78
those kinds of and I often found myself

2724.68 --> 2730.0
behind my lesson plans because we would

2727.78 --> 2731.44
entertain those questions and have those

2730.0 --> 2735.04
kinds of discussions which is what I

2731.44 --> 2737.08
think true education reflects the

2735.04 --> 2739.96
Socratic method of because what I would

2737.08 --> 2741.7599999999998
do is I would say okay Billy what do you

2739.96 --> 2744.28
think about what Tommy just said what do

2741.76 --> 2745.57
you think you know then you got to have

2744.28 --> 2746.86
people sit there and think about how

2745.57 --> 2748.06
they're gonna respond you know I mean

2746.86 --> 2750.6400000000003
that's the whole that's the true

2748.06 --> 2756.0299999999997
classroom I think right yet the the

2750.64 --> 2759.12
deeper thinking together not the

2756.03 --> 2764.26
multiple choice or false

2759.12 --> 2767.04
multiple choice is crap useless it's it

2764.26 --> 2771.6600000000003
can be used for sure for superficial

2767.04 --> 2774.73
statistical analysis absolutely but as

2771.66 --> 2778.54
part of a learning process it is quite

2774.73 --> 2781.93
useless because effectively people just

2778.54 --> 2784.7799999999997
Rams [ __ ] in their heads try to get the

2781.93 --> 2786.3399999999997
right details they don't concern

2784.78 --> 2788.86
themselves with oversight of

2786.34 --> 2790.4500000000003
understanding as much as when they

2788.86 --> 2792.58
wouldn't have to do this specifically

2790.45 --> 2795.3999999999996
and then most of them just completely

2792.58 --> 2797.29
forget about it afterwards oh yeah you

2795.4 --> 2799.12
cram yeah it's just a matter of cramming

2797.29 --> 2801.89
and then you forget it yeah yeah excuses

2799.12 --> 2805.96
yeah totally

2801.89 --> 2808.3399999999997
but again for statistical averages

2805.96 --> 2811.7
analysis that kind of thing yeah it

2808.34 --> 2816.1000000000004
could be useful but as as a so-called

2811.7 --> 2816.1
learning method no useless

2820.54 --> 2825.49
so I don't know if you if you saw it or

2822.91 --> 2831.1
not but I put in the earlybird Skype

2825.49 --> 2833.79
that saw yeah if you've heard it or not

2831.1 --> 2838.27
but it's a great sampling of Crow

2833.79 --> 2841.12
triple7 okay yeah so I don't know if

2838.27 --> 2843.13
you've figured out how to stream music

2841.12 --> 2846.1
through your OB yes yet but well I'm not

2843.13 --> 2849.4500000000003
gonna I'm not gonna risk that yeah I

2846.1 --> 2852.19
know I'm not gonna do music here unless

2849.45 --> 2855.5699999999997
specifically I got permission for it

2852.19 --> 2859.87
like the intro song oh look I got

2855.57 --> 2863.11
miraculously over the course of my

2859.87 --> 2865.99
youtube history I have had zero strikes

2863.11 --> 2868.03
or warnings and I'd like to keep it that

2865.99 --> 2870.25
way sure sure

2868.03 --> 2873.46
what I find funny is on my the plain

2870.25 --> 2878.59
truth Channel I've got two strikes for

2873.46 --> 2881.46
music but but the likes of Flat Earth

2878.59 --> 2883.83
dude you streams music for three hours

2881.46 --> 2886.42
on Thursday nights

2883.83 --> 2888.91
gets no strikes I'm like what the heck

2886.42 --> 2890.89
how does this guy stream music for three

2888.91 --> 2892.6299999999997
hours that's open you know even he's

2890.89 --> 2896.0699999999997
playing how them after album of

2892.63 --> 2899.29
everything well maybe he has permission

2896.07 --> 2901.6000000000004
maybe that is actually a music industry

2899.29 --> 2902.65
operation using Flat Earth to be

2901.6 --> 2906.46
attention-grabbing

2902.65 --> 2907.96
I don't know oh I asked him I said how

2906.46 --> 2908.89
is it that you don't get strikes and he

2907.96 --> 2910.54
goes I don't know dude

2908.89 --> 2912.67
so I would have thought that he would

2910.54 --> 2915.52
have said hey I'm God I did this I did

2912.67 --> 2918.31
this and so it's all good for me but

2915.52 --> 2919.66
anyway yeah cuz like I was streaming one

2918.31 --> 2921.91
night when I was driving home cuz I was

2919.66 --> 2924.37
trying to stay awake so I opened up I

2921.91 --> 2926.08
opened up a hangout to see if anybody

2924.37 --> 2930.58
would join and I was just playing my

2926.08 --> 2933.5099999999998
ipod in the background right right so he

2930.58 --> 2936.1
got struck because I was plenty

2933.51 --> 2937.84
someone using one piece of music got

2936.1 --> 2938.14
picked up or whatever they they killed

2937.84 --> 2945.6400000000003
it

2938.14 --> 2947.23
no really really that's sex yeah I mean

2945.64 --> 2948.8199999999997
it wasn't anything there wasn't anything

2947.23 --> 2952.54
substantial about the Hangout it was

2948.82 --> 2954.8700000000003
just me driving home so four o'clock in

2952.54 --> 2954.87
the morning

2956.74 --> 2963.3089999999997

2960.63 --> 2965.26
stuff with your own channel sorry I to

2963.309 --> 2967.03
be honest I haven't followed any of it

2965.26 --> 2968.71
well I don't that's fine

2967.03 --> 2970.5400000000004
yeah no worries you catch up whenever

2968.71 --> 2974.2
you want I did have an interview with

2970.54 --> 2976.54
max Egan last night though yeah you

2974.2 --> 2979.0299999999997
should like I would appreciate it even

2976.54 --> 2982.119
in Skype if you would just forward the

2979.03 --> 2985.2400000000002
videos to me so that I know try to

2982.119 --> 2988.03
remember right because otherwise I'm

2985.24 --> 2989.9199999999996
just gonna miss out yeah I was gonna try

2988.03 --> 2992.2900000000004
to livestream it but it was just I I

2989.92 --> 2994.359
started three hours early and I was

2992.29 --> 2995.92
gonna get OBS all lined up all this

2994.359 --> 2997.96
stuff lined up it was trouble after

2995.92 --> 2999.55
trouble after trouble and I got ten

2997.96 --> 3001.92
minutes before the show started and I'm

2999.55 --> 3005.579
like I am NOT live-streaming this right

3001.92 --> 3008.64
oh you could just premiere it you know

3005.579 --> 3012.03
some right same thing yeah except I was

3008.64 --> 3014.94
wanting to have questions for max from

3012.03 --> 3016.9500000000003
the audience but but he said he'd come

3014.94 --> 3021.51
back so next time we do it we'll try to

3016.95 --> 3022.9199999999996
make sure I get it all ironed out so but

3021.51 --> 3029.25
it was pretty good it was fun talking to

3022.92 --> 3033.7200000000003
him yeah used do seem to have quite a

3029.25 --> 3036.72
few interesting guests how do you get

3033.72 --> 3038.1899999999996
yeah I just contact him I just the the

3036.72 --> 3041.3089999999997
channels that I listen to you know I've

3038.19 --> 3042.9
tried I've made contact with Martin

3041.309 --> 3047.13

3049.77 --> 3054.089
well so you know I just the channels

3052.23 --> 3056.309
that I watch I just find out how to how

3054.089 --> 3057.27
to contact them and then you know it's

3056.309 --> 3062.369
all a matter of just getting your

3057.27 --> 3064.14
schedule lined up nice so all right I

3062.369 --> 3066.51
got to go unmute I got to jump inside my

3064.14 --> 3068.4
warehouse to get my papers and whatnot

3066.51 --> 3071.75
to start my day so I'll be back in a

3068.4 --> 3071.75
little bit okay

3073.42 --> 3081.59
all right so yeah guys subscribe to red

3078.89 --> 3085.64
hen radio on YouTube it's Travis's

3081.59 --> 3087.65
latest project and it's pretty

3085.64 --> 3089.6
interesting although yeah to be fair

3087.65 --> 3091.87
I've missed all of it and kind of

3089.6 --> 3095.93
embarrassed but there's so much stuff

3091.87 --> 3099.83
trust me nuts sometimes just doing a

3095.93 --> 3103.97
hangout myself and then debates although

3099.83 --> 3106.25
there isn't any of the of that now but

3103.97 --> 3110.1499999999996
then afterward I'm just done I'm just

3106.25 --> 3114.44
done with videos for the day it's like

3110.15 --> 3118.31
god those times from two years ago where

3114.44 --> 3121.04
I would literally be spending six seven

3118.31 --> 3123.29
hours spread out over the day watching

3121.04 --> 3126.68
videos you watching youtube videos

3123.29 --> 3131.99
watching just I don't have the patience

3126.68 --> 3134.6
for that anymore I just don't wanna it's

3131.99 --> 3138.49
not because I'm not interested I just

3134.6 --> 3138.49
don't have room in me for it

3140.14 --> 3147.49
but I do try and sometimes I'm just

3144.73 --> 3150.16
really late I discover a good video and

3147.49 --> 3154.18
it happens to be on the internet for a

3150.16 --> 3156.3399999999997
year or something so typical have this a

3154.18 --> 3159.6099999999997
lot I had this a lot with movies as well

3156.34 --> 3162.1200000000003
it's like oh wow I just saw this amazing

3159.61 --> 3167.86
movie that came out two years ago

3162.12 --> 3170.62
because I had no idea so I'm a little

3167.86 --> 3174.7000000000003
bit late sometimes although I do try to

3170.62 --> 3178.41
keep up with the the more important

3174.7 --> 3181.77
details about Flat Earth debates and

3178.41 --> 3185.92
reasoning that I involve myself in a

3181.77 --> 3191.7599999999998
chocolate saying chat peanuts Clark no

3185.92 --> 3195.25
guys any of you want to join the panel

3191.76 --> 3198.7000000000003
yeah get in here you're you're always

3195.25 --> 3200.4
welcome maybe with enough panel members

3198.7 --> 3205.5
we can have some kind of debate going

3200.4 --> 3205.5
might consider getting a baller in here

3205.98 --> 3209.82
maybe was we'll come on

3210.45 --> 3218.069
it's been an hour now he should probably

3213.119 --> 3221.76
be winding down or maybe it's going

3218.069 --> 3224.0299999999997
full-throttle still celebrating the new

3221.76 --> 3224.03
year

3229.07 --> 3234.92
no chocolate saying I'm not necessarily

3231.47 --> 3237.77
about to rap I've been going for almost

3234.92 --> 3238.28
an hour but hey I am open for panel

3237.77 --> 3239.84
members

3238.28 --> 3244.0400000000004
yeah there's gonna be no flat earth

3239.84 --> 3245.9300000000003
debate so yeah if you want to try to get

3244.04 --> 3250.13
some kind of debate going here again

3245.93 --> 3252.56
just like um went in last Wednesday then

3250.13 --> 3254.7200000000003
please please do so but I yeah I will

3252.56 --> 3257.96
need a couple of panel members in order

3254.72 --> 3260.18
to accomplish that so and the back chat

3257.96 --> 3264.98
is is open

3260.18 --> 3268.3999999999996
I got options for security so it's not

3264.98 --> 3271.12
gonna be too much trouble if we invite a

3268.4 --> 3271.12
baller in

3276.77 --> 3283.35
so

3279.04 --> 3283.35
hey was Happy New Year man

3288.39 --> 3294.87
now you can't hear me oh no am i coming

3293.18 --> 3297.75
am i coming through

3294.87 --> 3302.93
yeah that bean you you might yeah Happy

3297.75 --> 3306.03
New Year how was it so I was you know

3302.93 --> 3309.9199999999996
I've celebrated over 50 of them now so

3306.03 --> 3312.69
it's not a huge thing hmm

3309.92 --> 3315.48
lots of fireworks there as well or is it

3312.69 --> 3322.02
nothing yes yes um Sydney's watching

3315.48 --> 3324.36
thereunto on the TV of course Sydney

3322.02 --> 3326.24
Sydney's fireworks are very nice Mel

3324.36 --> 3328.71
Burns was enough quite up to scratch

3326.24 --> 3331.37
compared to C although modern Melbourne

3328.71 --> 3331.37
was different

3333.02 --> 3341.07
what's been happening today sorry what's

3337.02 --> 3344.19
been happening today oh just me and

3341.07 --> 3346.65
Travis talking and I've been talking a

3344.19 --> 3350.25
bit about the what I think is gonna come

3346.65 --> 3352.98
in 2019 and from what I've already seen

3350.25 --> 3356.25
arriving slowly much about the flat

3352.98 --> 3359.72
earth and things aspects about the flat

3356.25 --> 3363.72
earth and how they are going to be

3359.72 --> 3367.7999999999997
gradually introduced into the sub

3363.72 --> 3369.54
mainstream alternative media and how

3367.8 --> 3371.8500000000004
much of what we've been dealing with

3369.54 --> 3375.0
conceptualized thinking is gonna be

3371.85 --> 3377.8199999999997
introduced into the masses not

3375.0 --> 3382.35
necessarily accompanied by flat earth

3377.82 --> 3384.2400000000002
versus globe but just by passing that

3382.35 --> 3386.97
and getting to the more conceptual

3384.24 --> 3389.37
things like potential holographic globe

3386.97 --> 3391.89
of the heavens that the stars may be an

3389.37 --> 3395.31
illusion that the moon may not be real

3391.89 --> 3400.14
or that yeah things are not as they are

3395.31 --> 3402.15
I think that concept away from whether

3400.14 --> 3405.23
the earth be flat or globe is gonna

3402.15 --> 3408.4100000000003
pretty much now start to leak into the

3405.23 --> 3410.9900000000002
alternative mainstream and that is

3408.41 --> 3413.24
pretty thrilling in my opinion

3410.99 --> 3417.5
I've already I'm already seeing the

3413.24 --> 3419.81
signs of it so how much longer do you

3417.5 --> 3424.27
think sweaters will last before it

3419.81 --> 3428.089
fizzles air again no it's not gonna

3424.27 --> 3430.7
nothing so no now what is gonna fizzle

3428.089 --> 3434.7799999999997
is the old approach the heliocentric

3430.7 --> 3436.8489999999997
model and as a baseline and it's gonna

3434.78 --> 3440.3300000000004
go probably in all kinds of directions

3436.849 --> 3442.339
and I think eventually it will turn out

3440.33 --> 3446.33
quite depressing to the ballers because

3442.339 --> 3450.89
they will feel that the old concept is

3446.33 --> 3454.0099999999998
being abandoned and that they will lose

3450.89 --> 3455.5699999999997
their authority because of this it's

3454.01 --> 3458.1800000000003
gonna be very frustrating that's not all

3455.57 --> 3462.1400000000003
gonna happen in 2019 but it might start

3458.18 --> 3467.21
to I have to disagree we're gonna happen

3462.14 --> 3470.359
for a few more years but yeah the region

3467.21 --> 3473.08
of thinking is being opened culturally

3470.359 --> 3478.0989999999997
and that is happening and that is

3473.08 --> 3480.29
reversed so a global deception will have

3478.099 --> 3482.0
to be exposed first I think for it to be

3480.29 --> 3485.21
accepted yeah and that is already

3482.0 --> 3488.23
happening in the alternative media in a

3485.21 --> 3491.98
sub mainstream we will need a nother

3488.23 --> 3495.29
privatized Space Agency to know they're

3491.98 --> 3496.73
independent of know all other space

3495.29 --> 3498.77
that's what you think that's but you

3496.73 --> 3502.7
want to come no to come back and say

3498.77 --> 3504.92
it's all fake no you don't need that you

3502.7 --> 3508.04
just need to show the proof of how

3504.92 --> 3510.71
things were faked and what information

3508.04 --> 3512.48
was held back that's the only thing

3510.71 --> 3515.0
that's required you don't need a new

3512.48 --> 3517.43
group to take over their reigns of the

3515.0 --> 3519.29
priesthood in a new model you know death

3517.43 --> 3521.27
no that's that's what they need that's

3519.29 --> 3526.67
what the controllers need the people are

3521.27 --> 3529.04
not gonna give it to them people can do

3526.67 --> 3531.71
things themselves now they just need to

3529.04 --> 3534.65
be allowed to do them and potentially

3531.71 --> 3537.29
muster up enough financial resources to

3534.65 --> 3541.94
do it but with the increase in

3537.29 --> 3544.34
technological power and cheapening of it

3541.94 --> 3548.32
that will become much more excessive

3544.34 --> 3551.57
NASA is no longer needed

3548.32 --> 3554.48
scientifically eventually it's just not

3551.57 --> 3558.05
gonna be necessary anymore what do we do

3554.48 --> 3560.84
with the observations we have from space

3558.05 --> 3563.1800000000003
or from outside of the atmosphere not

3560.84 --> 3566.8
not by space agencies but by your

3563.18 --> 3570.5899999999997
average people outside of the atmosphere

3566.8 --> 3572.51
yeah the photographs that we have off

3570.59 --> 3575.57
that oh really

3572.51 --> 3578.3300000000004
so can you provide any to me that are

3575.57 --> 3581.21
not originating from NASA

3578.33 --> 3584.06
yeah there's no space agency that is

3581.21 --> 3587.3
directly linked to them with it well

3584.06 --> 3589.64
there's heaps of images taken by people

3587.3 --> 3593.8700000000003
who have launched their Ryan

3589.64 --> 3596.3799999999997
high-altitude balloons right well

3593.87 --> 3598.94
there's somebody nice actually

3596.38 --> 3601.25
right chatting channels who are going

3598.94 --> 3604.01
you can prove that their camera is not

3601.25 --> 3609.76
applying a fisheye lens which should be

3604.01 --> 3612.7700000000004
quite hard specific well then yeah sure

3609.76 --> 3614.78
it's mother for what it's worth it's not

3612.77 --> 3618.23
that it's not the curvature that I'm

3614.78 --> 3621.2000000000003
talking about that you see in those

3618.23 --> 3623.51
images I know the curvature and I know

3621.2 --> 3625.6699999999996
the curvature can be taken with a

3623.51 --> 3631.3100000000004
fisheye lens or mattes people have to

3625.67 --> 3632.6
claim barrel distortion etc etc etc but

3631.31 --> 3634.16
I'm not talking about looking at the

3632.6 --> 3636.2
curvature from those pictures I'm

3634.16 --> 3640.6099999999997
talking about the fact that you are

3636.2 --> 3644.06
above the atmosphere and there's no one

3640.61 --> 3646.79
is above the atmosphere well you can see

3644.06 --> 3649.79
the clouds below oh it's the clouds the

3646.79 --> 3655.2799999999997
atmosphere it's towards the top oh yeah

3649.79 --> 3656.93
oh really is it is it is it are you sure

3655.28 --> 3659.3
about that because I think that

3656.93 --> 3662.74
atmosphere is mostly gas which is

3659.3 --> 3665.26
transparent clouds is just water vapor

3662.74 --> 3667.97
material yeah physically yeah

3665.26 --> 3670.34
solidifying again working it's a liquid

3667.97 --> 3673.1899999999996
that's why it becomes visible at a very

3670.34 --> 3677.15
low altitude relative

3673.19 --> 3680.21
so I don't think so I don't think there

3677.15 --> 3683.0
are photographs from outside of the

3680.21 --> 3685.13
atmosphere because there is no outside

3683.0 --> 3687.38
of the atmosphere then where did those

3685.13 --> 3693.25
balloons go when they poked they go up

3687.38 --> 3695.6600000000003
and then they go down what did I poke

3693.25 --> 3698.869
because the pressure in the balloon is

3695.66 --> 3703.48
going to be too great for its structural

3698.869 --> 3706.7200000000003
integrity to hold pressure difference

3703.48 --> 3710.78
ahead is the pressure get less up there

3706.72 --> 3714.5589999999997
because of the gradient why is there

3710.78 --> 3719.2000000000003
gradient because that's the way it's

3714.559 --> 3719.2000000000003
manifested what suppressing against

3719.589 --> 3725.5099999999998
matter is all matter pressing against

3722.27 --> 3728.839
more matters also it doesn't need to be

3725.51 --> 3735.44
a lead or a membrane or anything like

3728.839 --> 3738.589
that I don't know but what I do know is

3735.44 --> 3741.26
there can be no vacuum at any point so

3738.589 --> 3744.23
it's gonna be a gradient and it's even

3741.26 --> 3745.9100000000003
recorded right now the actual data of

3744.23 --> 3747.71
pressure and the gradient you will

3745.91 --> 3751.19
notice that the gradient the further you

3747.71 --> 3754.069
go up will have a half-life effect an

3751.19 --> 3757.43
asymptote which means the higher up you

3754.069 --> 3760.49
go the bigger the different density

3757.43 --> 3762.5589999999997
layers the lower density layers the

3760.49 --> 3765.8289999999997
higher up you go become so that

3762.559 --> 3768.349
exponential growth kind of opens up the

3765.829 --> 3769.2200000000003
possibility that technically it could go

3768.349 --> 3771.8590000000004
up forever

3769.22 --> 3774.41
but there's never gonna be a vacuum ever

3771.859 --> 3777.619
but if it goes up forever and it it's

3774.41 --> 3779.029
especially getting no it's technically

3777.619 --> 3783.02
possible now that doesn't mean that it

3779.029 --> 3786.039
is it'll get next to nothing no

3783.02 --> 3789.02
eventually no it will not

3786.039 --> 3791.6600000000003
no because of the how vation

3789.02 --> 3797.5389999999998
which will also eventually start to

3791.66 --> 3800.5389999999998
become infinitely large but what the

3797.539 --> 3802.6090000000004
gradient size it will be stretch up the

3800.539 --> 3803.8300000000004
further you go up which will make it

3802.609 --> 3807.7599999999998
eventually

3803.83 --> 3810.1
infinitely wide technically raw if it's

3807.76 --> 3811.9900000000002
technically infinitely up then this

3810.1 --> 3813.3399999999997
spectrum of the gradient will be

3811.99 --> 3816.52
infinitely large

3813.34 --> 3819.6400000000003
there will be no vacuum so why can't we

3816.52 --> 3823.15
go there in rocket shoes because we

3819.64 --> 3829.0
don't have the technology to escape the

3823.15 --> 3830.6800000000003
lower pressure density ooh - yeah but

3829.0 --> 3833.26
that only can bring us so far because

3830.68 --> 3834.7599999999998
the balloon will match with our combined

3833.26 --> 3837.82
weight or whatever you're launching up

3834.76 --> 3840.4
there to form the average relative

3837.82 --> 3843.13
density layer and then there is a max

3840.4 --> 3847.9
that it can reach what do you mean by

3843.13 --> 3850.69
relative density well you combine the

3847.9 --> 3853.81
average density the the relative density

3850.69 --> 3856.96
of the balloon and the helium and the

3853.81 --> 3859.2999999999997
thing that's hanging by it and then you

3856.96 --> 3862.39
can determine what the average relative

3859.3 --> 3864.73
density is of that combined object and

3862.39 --> 3867.64
figure out what layer it's going to be

3864.73 --> 3871.09
ending up in and what's the but what's

3867.64 --> 3875.83
its density relative to to everything

3871.09 --> 3878.9700000000003
surrounding it matter to the air to the

3875.83 --> 3878.97
medium it's in yeah

3881.93 --> 3887.839
so well that's only if you're gonna use

3884.24 --> 3892.7299999999996
the buoyant effect and the relative

3887.839 --> 3894.859
density concept that system to arise

3892.73 --> 3897.859
above but it's always gonna be stuck at

3894.859 --> 3900.92
some point you somehow God s bypassed

3897.859 --> 3904.7599999999998
that and I suggest that that could

3900.92 --> 3909.799
potentially be done by polarizing

3904.76 --> 3912.5
effects like if it is involved indeed in

3909.799 --> 3915.44
the gradient yeah if the cause of the

3912.5 --> 3918.14
gradient could be known why it is like

3915.44 --> 3920.299
that then that could help us indicate

3918.14 --> 3922.339
how we can actually counteract it or

3920.299 --> 3924.23
escape it and then there is the

3922.339 --> 3927.14
possibility of electrostatic propulsion

3924.23 --> 3932.21
as a technology that could help escape

3927.14 --> 3935.93
or escape help ascend above the lower

3932.21 --> 3938.93
density layers potentially how all knows

3935.93 --> 3940.91
how far maybe if you have electrostatic

3938.93 --> 3942.5589999999997
propulsion you can have like in shuttle

3940.91 --> 3946.549
or whatever with it

3942.559 --> 3948.71
you've UFO and just fly up for five

3946.549 --> 3951.17
hundred years straight and then as soon

3948.71 --> 3953.9
as you turn off yeah you drop down five

3951.17 --> 3958.25
hundred years straight who knows try it

3953.9 --> 3960.109
out I don't know I don't think anyone's

3958.25 --> 3962.539
been crazy enough to test anything like

3960.109 --> 3965.21
that well may-maybe they have sent

3962.539 --> 3969.17
drones up this way instead of actually

3965.21 --> 3971.63
sending them out in space they did like

3969.17 --> 3973.67
send drones up with electrostatic

3971.63 --> 3979.94
propulsion kept completely secret just

3973.67 --> 3983.51
to see how far up it goes who they sent

3979.94 --> 3986.18
them up well in this case NASA because

3983.51 --> 3990.349
just because NASA is fooling us doesn't

3986.18 --> 3993.23
mean that they don't have the means to

3990.349 --> 3995.809
do actual exploration and figuring out

3993.23 --> 3998.839
of the world in secret with their huge

3995.809 --> 4000.4900000000002
budget and they'll never tell us how do

3998.839 --> 4004.21
we determine what they're doing is real

4000.49 --> 4007.029
and what is fake by analyzing what is

4004.21 --> 4009.4
presented to us or do we just take what

4007.029 --> 4011.859
fits our narrative to determine what's

4009.4 --> 4015.52
real well that's up to you I take the

4011.859 --> 4018.97
evidence for what it is

4015.52 --> 4021.67
by analyzing it and seeing if it could

4018.97 --> 4024.7
be a real or if it is fake how it could

4021.67 --> 4027.09
be faked what skill sending out your

4024.7 --> 4027.0899999999997
mind

4029.82 --> 4037.3900000000003
okay so what's what skill set do you use

4032.619 --> 4041.05
to analyze it everything I know and

4037.39 --> 4044.95
everything when you see my intuition my

4041.05 --> 4047.0800000000004
knowledge of how fakery works what could

4044.95 --> 4050.2
be done what could potentially be done

4047.08 --> 4053.29
that isn't known about you can see hints

4050.2 --> 4054.3689999999997
of tricks that are not yet revealed I've

4053.29 --> 4056.59
done this before

4054.369 --> 4060.03
so how did you cultivate your knowledge

4056.59 --> 4062.44
to be able to determine what you have

4060.03 --> 4064.5600000000004
with evidence that you have gathered

4062.44 --> 4069.01
using your intuition intuition

4064.56 --> 4073.72
intertwined into that what just guides

4069.01 --> 4076.5400000000004
me and I find concepts I'm but I just

4073.72 --> 4078.6699999999996
lay going around in a big way because

4076.54 --> 4081.67
look everything that I proposed is

4078.67 --> 4085.66
conceptual but the evidence is on which

4081.67 --> 4089.79
is those concepts are are there are

4085.66 --> 4089.79
there they're final they are provable

4090.119 --> 4096.7300000000005
but it's your interpretation of the

4092.29 --> 4098.62
evidence no no it's not now the flat

4096.73 --> 4101.129999999999
earth arguments the flat earth proofs

4098.62 --> 4101.13
remain

4102.44 --> 4107.36
that's what I'm basing it on it doesn't

4104.6 --> 4110.93
necessarily have to be involved in a lot

4107.36 --> 4117.71
of it but it is there and I do use it as

4110.93 --> 4122.900000000001
a foundation to build on to anchor a

4117.71 --> 4124.46
certain spaciality aspect right no

4122.9 --> 4127.639999999999
offense mind I enjoy your show and

4124.46 --> 4136.61
you're a good host but I don't I don't

4127.64 --> 4138.08
find that convincing just saying is the

4136.61 --> 4158.03
saying is I don't give a flying rat's

4138.08 --> 4172.1
ass hey Randy just hand-wave force

4158.03 --> 4175.19
mister that is all oh well it's it's

4172.1 --> 4178.01
difficult to keep Darwin's experiences

4175.19 --> 4181.28
and knowledge against those that have

4178.01 --> 4183.4400000000005
actually done the stuff and he did say

4181.28 --> 4188.9
most of what he's come up with is

4183.44 --> 4190.7
conceptual so I'm not being salting in

4188.9 --> 4193.3099999999995
any way it's just the way I see it

4190.7 --> 4195.0199999999995
well you don't find my concept very

4193.31 --> 4197.030000000001
convincing oh I'm sorry

4195.02 --> 4200.120000000001
not I'm sorry that you don't get it

4197.03 --> 4202.219999999999
because it is concepts and I understand

4200.12 --> 4204.5599999999995
what you're saying yeah what about that

4202.22 --> 4205.37
all religions concepts cuz they're all

4204.56 --> 4208.990000000001
just concepts

4205.37 --> 4211.94
yeah the concepts that I have actual

4208.99 --> 4215.0
distinguishable holes in them that we've

4211.94 --> 4218.65
been shoving in everyone's face well the

4215.0 --> 4222.53
bull religions concept is supported by a

4218.65 --> 4223.549999999999
massive global deception is it not well

4222.53 --> 4227.48
I like the way that you would manage

4223.55 --> 4231.8
that's concept hey one thing well I make

4227.48 --> 4234.349999999999
up play and it related your argument I'm

4231.8 --> 4235.91
playing to your argument so yeah I'll

4234.35 --> 4236.21
say those I'll use those words so I'm

4235.91 --> 4238.19
quite

4236.21 --> 4240.62
have a problem using those words do you

4238.19 --> 4245.15
have a reason to say that it shouldn't

4240.62 --> 4247.219
be a concept then yeah I don't believe

4245.15 --> 4248.929999999999
that they say and it is a belief and I

4247.219 --> 4251.6
heard more faith in man and I don't

4248.93 --> 4254.150000000001
believe it is a worldwide deception so

4251.6 --> 4257.570000000001
yes you have a belief about a concept

4254.15 --> 4262.37
that is absolutely naive for an adult

4257.57 --> 4266.42
because I felt the same till not roughly

4262.37 --> 4268.34
my 21st birthday and then was rammed in

4266.42 --> 4272.75
my face so hard that that is absolutely

4268.34 --> 4276.2300000000005
not the case that that is the the worst

4272.75 --> 4283.37
it is a global Stockholm Syndrome

4276.23 --> 4288.29
response if you really believe that to a

4283.37 --> 4290.39
different different area maybe try to

4288.29 --> 4293.6
flesh this out a little bit was do you

4290.39 --> 4298.34
do you believe your government has lied

4293.6 --> 4301.280000000001
to you on any level yeah okay so do you

4298.34 --> 4304.55
believe that lie oh I guess they see

4301.28 --> 4307.37
what what lie would you describe for us

4304.55 --> 4310.16
that would be pretty extensive I mean

4307.37 --> 4311.8099999999995
like let's say nationwide over the for

4310.16 --> 4314.2699999999995
the country of Australia like say the

4311.81 --> 4315.650000000001
whole country of Australia has been

4314.27 --> 4321.860000000001
lying often by their government yeah I

4315.65 --> 4324.32
understand what you asking I'm just

4321.86 --> 4326.75
trying to think of something specific I

4324.32 --> 4330.58
mean this that I can we saw and how how

4326.75 --> 4336.469
about your your phony structure or

4330.58 --> 4340.75
carbon taxes oh look that the

4336.469 --> 4340.75
politicians lie to get into position

4341.08 --> 4347.93
especially at election time so they make

4345.14 --> 4349.7300000000005
and you can consider those white lies in

4347.93 --> 4353.0
comparison to what you're asking me I

4349.73 --> 4356.0
suppose it lies you think that's white

4353.0 --> 4358.13
lies in comparison to what you're

4356.0 --> 4361.43
actually the type of lies you asking me

4358.13 --> 4363.08
to describe really these these lies that

4361.43 --> 4365.900000000001
the politicians say to get themselves

4363.08 --> 4367.61
into position are much smaller false

4365.9 --> 4369.179
products do you think that false

4367.61 --> 4372.21
promises from

4369.179 --> 4375.92
from a government is different than

4372.21 --> 4377.699
false promises from a scientific agency

4375.92 --> 4379.14
because that's what they're doing

4377.699 --> 4381.32
they're giving you false promises

4379.14 --> 4383.51
they're telling you this is all there

4381.32 --> 4386.219
that's the job

4383.51 --> 4389.01
it's exactly the same only it's not

4386.219 --> 4390.9890000000005
being revealed after a certain point

4389.01 --> 4393.659000000001
like with politicians because they do

4390.989 --> 4395.37
show that you just act differently NASA

4393.659 --> 4398.699
doesn't do that but it's the same thing

4395.37 --> 4401.01
I don't see any of it being exposed per

4398.699 --> 4403.62
se I mean you've got people who have

4401.01 --> 4405.719
analyzed the video and say this looks

4403.62 --> 4408.12
like this and that looks like that

4405.719 --> 4413.719
therefore it's faith but you haven't

4408.12 --> 4413.719
even seen anyone with with credentials

4418.25 --> 4426.199
with the same level okay can I do the

4423.21 --> 4426.199
say good morning to everybody

4427.73 --> 4437.4
sorry 2019 for me oh you're in the

4432.719 --> 4440.219
future right mm-hmm so was my my point

4437.4 --> 4443.5199999999995
was not to bring up individual picadillo

4440.219 --> 4446.58
of politicians I'm talking about I'm

4443.52 --> 4448.320000000001
talking about your government and the

4446.58 --> 4451.62
constructs that they've given to the

4448.32 --> 4455.34
entire nation where the nativist behaves

4451.62 --> 4458.01
and beliefs and I understand what we're

4455.34 --> 4459.54
asking that's what you're asking

4458.01 --> 4461.1900000000005
right right so I had to do my reform

4459.54 --> 4462.71
what I said I don't think it was

4461.19 --> 4467.449
understood though but that's okay I

4462.71 --> 4467.449
can't see more for a broad yeah

4467.76 --> 4474.030000000001
taxi do you think the taxation taxation

4471.81 --> 4476.6
system is a false construct or do you

4474.03 --> 4479.54
think it's valid and true

4476.6 --> 4482.21
when you say false construct what do you

4479.54 --> 4488.21
mean do you believe that you are

4482.21 --> 4491.93
obligated to pay taxes I think yeah I

4488.21 --> 4495.2300000000005
think I should pay taxes for certain

4491.93 --> 4497.950000000001
things to be provided in in the land I'm

4495.23 --> 4500.48
living in yeah surfaces in the society

4497.95 --> 4503.36
okay so what what facts do you depend

4500.48 --> 4506.5
upon to say that you're obliged that is

4503.36 --> 4509.33
you are obligated that is what facts

4506.5 --> 4512.06
yeah why do you believe that you're

4509.33 --> 4513.95
obligated to pay that like I just think

4512.06 --> 4518.330000000001
like this think it's the right moral

4513.95 --> 4522.38
thing to do why well I live in the

4518.33 --> 4527.93
society I use I use the infrastructure

4522.38 --> 4529.67
and that has to be paid for so I believe

4527.93 --> 4538.9400000000005
that the right thing to do is contribute

4529.67 --> 4541.1900000000005
to that I don't see that being a major

4538.94 --> 4542.179999999999
problem no I'm not saying it is I'm just

4541.19 --> 4546.139999999999
trying to understand

4542.18 --> 4548.990000000001
I don't yeah yeah do you see that it's a

4546.14 --> 4552.68
problem use do you think I'm I'm being

4548.99 --> 4554.69
naive in that sense yeah well yeah it's

4552.68 --> 4556.7300000000005
almost like let's say let's instead of

4554.69 --> 4559.69
talking about taxes let's say just say a

4556.73 --> 4563.2699999999995
charity are you habla are you obliged to

4559.69 --> 4568.87
to contribute to the women's shelter

4563.27 --> 4568.870000000001
charity are you am obligated are you

4569.89 --> 4576.110000000001
don't pay for that don't contribute to

4572.6 --> 4578.93
that charity not are you threatened with

4576.11 --> 4582.3099999999995
imprisonment and with coercion and force

4578.93 --> 4582.31
if you don't pay your taxes

4582.519 --> 4592.329000000001
probably yeah let's say so yeah okay do

4585.28 --> 4594.969
you think that's just I think hmm yeah

4592.329 --> 4596.259999999999
that's a curly one yes I think people if

4594.969 --> 4600.219
people are going to live in this society

4596.26 --> 4601.780000000001
and use the resources I think people

4600.219 --> 4604.3
should be paying for that and what if

4601.78 --> 4608.71
you don't use the resources well are you

4604.3 --> 4609.88
still being for you to pay don't go down

4608.71 --> 4612.57
that road

4609.88 --> 4617.289
so my question though to you was is is

4612.57 --> 4619.78
it is it is it just for your government

4617.289 --> 4623.38
to imprison you or threaten you with

4619.78 --> 4627.639
coercion and force if you don't pay your

4623.38 --> 4629.559
taxes well if your child does something

4627.639 --> 4635.2300000000005
wrong do you no no no it's a

4629.559 --> 4638.769
conceptually well it's a pun of

4635.23 --> 4640.659
punishment for disobeying the law and so

4638.769 --> 4643.780000000001
my question then comes back to you what

4640.659 --> 4646.839999999999
evidence do you rely upon to show that

4643.78 --> 4652.539
you're obligated to conform to the law

4646.84 --> 4653.92
to the code of your country outside of

4652.539 --> 4659.05
the fact that they're threatening you

4653.92 --> 4660.4
with force and what evidence - hang on

4659.05 --> 4663.719
can you cite it again because I'm trying

4660.4 --> 4668.558999999999
to understand the question what evidence

4663.719 --> 4672.789
can fly to a law what facts are you

4668.559 --> 4675.309
relying upon to justify or prove that

4672.789 --> 4678.28
your government has the right to

4675.309 --> 4682.559
threaten you with coercion force and

4678.28 --> 4686.199
imprisonment if you don't pay your taxes

4682.559 --> 4690.46
well it's a law that the government has

4686.199 --> 4693.629999999999
put in place and the people apparently

4690.46 --> 4699.25
have approved

4693.63 --> 4703.42
so apparently you're basing your your

4699.25 --> 4706.179
conclusion on an apparition yes at this

4703.42 --> 4708.82
stage at this stage okay so we'll bring

4706.179 --> 4712.42
that back is that apparition a false

4708.82 --> 4715.42
construct that your entire nation is

4712.42 --> 4720.2
operating under

4715.42 --> 4723.71
hmm no because it eventually let's not

4720.2 --> 4728.09
eventually Stace well for you guys it is

4723.71 --> 4730.16
no use there are apparition on a sense

4728.09 --> 4732.68
of apparent agreement that's not a

4730.16 --> 4734.45
confront relevant let me start that word

4732.68 --> 4736.610000000001
because I was using it to your benefit

4734.45 --> 4738.86
but then restore it as I I don't I don't

4736.61 --> 4741.349999999999
really agree that it is apparent I think

4738.86 --> 4743.03
the people have voted the people have

4741.35 --> 4745.96
voted for a particular government and

4743.03 --> 4750.83
the government has put forward laws and

4745.96 --> 4753.83
people have that into into place through

4750.83 --> 4757.01
their voting now whether the voting

4753.83 --> 4759.95
counts so when there's an election

4757.01 --> 4762.02
people get people vote the votes get

4759.95 --> 4765.74
counted now whether the votes are

4762.02 --> 4767.96
counted fairly or not I'm not involved

4765.74 --> 4771.679999999999
in that so I can't speak to either way

4767.96 --> 4774.89
with us adjust or even way of doing it

4771.68 --> 4778.04
or not so we have we have to put some

4774.89 --> 4780.8
trust in humans to do the right thing

4778.04 --> 4783.14
it's um so let's jump on that let's jump

4780.8 --> 4785.63
on that real quick you you offered the

4783.14 --> 4790.31
possibility that the counting of the

4785.63 --> 4792.16
votes is perhaps not just well I don't

4790.31 --> 4795.56
know I don't why I'm saying I don't know

4792.16 --> 4798.639999999999
why the possibility there is a because I

4795.56 --> 4800.72
don't know I guess there's a possibility

4798.64 --> 4803.81
right but I guess that's what I'm saying

4800.72 --> 4805.25
is that let's say for instance another

4803.81 --> 4807.38
person might say I don't even question

4805.25 --> 4808.91
that of just accurate what do you mean

4807.38 --> 4810.9800000000005
why would you even question whether or

4808.91 --> 4814.01
not they can't count the votes

4810.98 --> 4817.759999999999
accurately so the fact that you give

4814.01 --> 4820.55
that that caveat is in the back of your

4817.76 --> 4822.5
mind that there's a possible cause II of

4820.55 --> 4824.21
course okay hold on let me finish my

4822.5 --> 4826.94
statement that there's a possibility

4824.21 --> 4830.78
that you're being lied to on a massive

4826.94 --> 4834.049999999999
scale yeah okay so if that's possible

4830.78 --> 4836.0199999999995
in this scenario that's all we're asking

4834.05 --> 4839.09
you to consider in another scenario

4836.02 --> 4841.96
consider a field of science considering

4839.09 --> 4841.96
that the last 30 years

4843.26 --> 4849.0
and also lies can be compared to

4846.42 --> 4851.6990000000005
mentalize don't forget about that yeah

4849.0 --> 4855.44
not everyone has to know not so sure

4851.699 --> 4858.058999999999
about that but it is that's it really is

4855.44 --> 4860.159
neat to the houses that's the whole you

4858.059 --> 4863.909000000001
know base what you're saying what does

4860.159 --> 4864.98
he expect yeah how can you say that

4863.909 --> 4866.909
you're not even sure about that

4864.98 --> 4869.159
compartmentalization of a lie when we

4866.909 --> 4873.598999999999
just basically prove that with regards

4869.159 --> 4876.179
to voting to the government yeah we just

4873.599 --> 4877.8
departmentalized given bogies and said

4876.179 --> 4880.71
that there's a possibility that there's

4877.8 --> 4882.9890000000005
a massive deception in the voting

4880.71 --> 4884.7300000000005
structure that's compartmentalization

4882.989 --> 4887.25
and then you said well I'm not too sure

4884.73 --> 4890.428999999999
that lives can be compartmentalize but

4887.25 --> 4893.07
we just went through it everybody in the

4890.429 --> 4895.1990000000005
party doing the vote reading needs to

4893.07 --> 4897.84
know about the vote rigging just say

4895.199 --> 4899.94
it's actually counterproductive so who

4897.84 --> 4902.07
says that in actual functioning

4899.94 --> 4905.19
government or in the shadow government

4902.07 --> 4908.94
that they're not gonna compartmentalize

4905.19 --> 4911.129999999999
the truth on a need-to-know basis like

4908.94 --> 4914.129999999999
okay this person who knows that could

4911.13 --> 4916.86
handle that everything is a lie we need

4914.13 --> 4918.9490000000005
him to be informed thanks controlling

4916.86 --> 4924.21
the truth in he's controlling this this

4918.949 --> 4927.57
deception oh it's gonna be the deep

4924.21 --> 4930.119
state the deep states multiple the

4927.57 --> 4933.09
shadow government's the robber barons

4930.119 --> 4936.119
the the real controllers the big a lot

4933.09 --> 4941.03
of people now not a lot of people just

4936.119 --> 4945.21
the the key people of the big well this

4941.03 --> 4950.55
530 people that have bent into space or

4945.21 --> 4953.67
their parents they are they all lies as

4950.55 --> 4955.860000000001
well are they they will be in on this

4953.67 --> 4958.5
specific area nice they were involved

4955.86 --> 4960.9
win at least but that doesn't even look

4958.5 --> 4962.82
they could even be fooled in a way that

4960.9 --> 4966.449
they are like really good believers and

4962.82 --> 4970.139
saying like okay yeah we kind of have to

4966.449 --> 4972.119
do this test run through studios we have

4970.139 --> 4973.71
to fake it first and then we'll send you

4972.119 --> 4976.0199999999995
up the so they help fake

4973.71 --> 4978.68
believing yeah well it's this is just

4976.02 --> 4981.360000000001
for productionvalue blah blah blah and

4978.68 --> 4983.400000000001
then okay where and when are we gonna go

4981.36 --> 4985.349999999999
up no that's what that was just people

4983.4 --> 4988.679999999999
and now you need to be silent or you're

4985.35 --> 4992.06
gonna be in trouble that [ __ ] that's how

4988.68 --> 4997.04
things can be done that's the power of

4992.06 --> 5006.1
compartmentalization is all about

4997.04 --> 5010.55
organization you know that was hey sorry

5006.1 --> 5013.370000000001
so you know yeah I mean come on it's

5010.55 --> 5015.29
just that's common sense of course just

5013.37 --> 5017.24
come from you know I'm just trying to

5015.29 --> 5019.04
get Asian I'm just trying to get a

5017.24 --> 5020.8099999999995
handle from you guys is to have any

5019.04 --> 5025.19
people have to be in control

5020.81 --> 5030.92
knowing the lie globally the past passes

5025.19 --> 5033.7699999999995
through look the thing is they're like

5030.92 --> 5036.77
what is the lie the lie itself can be

5033.77 --> 5038.330000000001
compartmentalized so some people big

5036.77 --> 5040.820000000001
group of people might have a hint

5038.33 --> 5043.7
up to a certain degree about can I

5040.82 --> 5046.849999999999
finish please can have a hint about the

5043.7 --> 5048.47
lie up to a certain degree but they

5046.85 --> 5050.570000000001
don't know everything about it that just

5048.47 --> 5054.14
know this aspect about it then another

5050.57 --> 5057.349999999999
layer that guides them the other the

5054.14 --> 5060.47
lower layer they will know one step more

5057.35 --> 5063.1
about it speaking that is a great

5060.47 --> 5066.01
societies function that is exactly how

5063.1 --> 5068.6
Freemasonry functions even in the open

5066.01 --> 5070.97
but it was a certain level because their

5068.6 --> 5073.97
truths are also compartmentalized of

5070.97 --> 5076.1
course but the structure they show that

5073.97 --> 5078.530000000001
they show that in the open yeah it is a

5076.1 --> 5081.14
secret society it is compartmentalized

5078.53 --> 5083.96
and you have to get through it to get to

5081.14 --> 5087.110000000001
the goods to the real stuff and you have

5083.96 --> 5091.7
to keep it secret and it's everywhere

5087.11 --> 5095.679999999999
and it's a control mechanism umbrella is

5091.7 --> 5098.99
speaking in umbrella terms it's

5095.68 --> 5101.990000000001
applicable how could it work

5098.99 --> 5105.44
I couldn't work though not not broad

5101.99 --> 5108.08
turns people just be doing what they

5105.44 --> 5109.58
need to be doing on a need-to-know basis

5108.08 --> 5112.16
and as long as they do that because

5109.58 --> 5113.93
everything keeps on going what did I

5112.16 --> 5116.12
need to know you know drill it right

5113.93 --> 5118.58
down break it right there I need to know

5116.12 --> 5122.0
what they need to do they need to know

5118.58 --> 5125.42
what they need to do and they don't need

5122.0 --> 5127.76
to know why so the guys are program all

5125.42 --> 5129.89
the CGI right

5127.76 --> 5133.13
they're gonna need they're gonna need to

5129.89 --> 5135.4400000000005
know there's a lie no not necessarily no

5133.13 --> 5138.76
they could told that they're just

5135.44 --> 5141.049999999999
modeling it out for a production value

5138.76 --> 5143.6
yeah tell them when they see it

5141.05 --> 5146.0
broadcast on TV and go hey that's my

5143.6 --> 5147.92
word they told me they told me these no

5146.0 --> 5150.32
yeah that's right they put and then what

5147.92 --> 5153.05
happens is okay if you talk about it

5150.32 --> 5155.2699999999995
you're fired and we're gonna sue you and

5153.05 --> 5157.28
we're gonna take away as much as we can

5155.27 --> 5166.1900000000005
or are you gonna shut up about it

5157.28 --> 5168.71
take a bonus and get on with because

5166.19 --> 5170.5599999999995
people never get it people never get

5168.71 --> 5173.14
Drive in this world that never happens

5170.56 --> 5175.490000000001
you're mocking me

5173.14 --> 5185.240000000001
yeah why are you mocking me we're having

5175.49 --> 5187.3
a discussion seems like you're mocking

5185.24 --> 5191.929999999999
our way it doesn't really seem like

5187.3 --> 5193.55
you're being real genuine right now and

5191.93 --> 5196.13
so you sound like you're smarter than

5193.55 --> 5198.2
what you're letting on right now not to

5196.13 --> 5201.35
say that you're stupid or anything I'm

5198.2 --> 5203.179999999999
not trying to insult you but it seems

5201.35 --> 5205.85
like you're asking real common sense

5203.18 --> 5207.59
questions and it spike you you I'm

5205.85 --> 5208.610000000001
pretty sure you have a good bead on how

5207.59 --> 5210.2300000000005
the world works

5208.61 --> 5213.799999999999
apart from thinking you lives on the

5210.23 --> 5215.509999999999
ball so I don't I don't find it genuine

5213.8 --> 5216.89
but I mean that's just me I don't think

5215.51 --> 5219.95
our went mocking you

5216.89 --> 5223.570000000001
oh he used to turn to voice after I said

5219.95 --> 5226.07
something sarcasm okay it's sarcasm yeah

5223.57 --> 5228.679999999999
because I mean it's condoms all right

5226.07 --> 5231.799999999999
what we're saying that we're not you

5228.68 --> 5232.37
know that's trying to come off crazy but

5231.8 --> 5235.58
you know

5232.37 --> 5237.17
government right yeah right I mean

5235.58 --> 5239.24
you're not gonna just sit here and say

5237.17 --> 5241.67
all the government of my dormady

5239.24 --> 5243.05
hey tell me everything is everything

5241.67 --> 5246.14
that they tell me is true you know that

5243.05 --> 5249.320000000001
that's not right let you know they like

5246.14 --> 5252.17
then how can you prove how can you

5249.32 --> 5255.139999999999
determine that there is a limit to the

5252.17 --> 5258.38
lies they can wield I do I know that why

5255.14 --> 5261.89
do you accept this that there is a limit

5258.38 --> 5264.11
to the lies they can reveal to the depth

5261.89 --> 5265.910000000001
ahead oh I know they lie I've just told

5264.11 --> 5267.95
you that right

5265.91 --> 5271.04
and I am saying a lot sponsor that how

5267.95 --> 5271.34
do you know that that is as far as they

5271.04 --> 5274.85
go

5271.34 --> 5276.56
lie in concern yeah the question goes

5274.85 --> 5278.09
back to you Duke and and I asked this

5276.56 --> 5280.01
already and you already conceded so

5278.09 --> 5283.37
we'll ask it again do you believe your

5280.01 --> 5285.02
government lies to you if you just want

5283.37 --> 5287.39
to yes no answer being questioned at the

5285.02 --> 5288.740000000001
answer that for years okay so then I

5287.39 --> 5292.820000000001
would say how would you prove it

5288.74 --> 5295.07
I can't oh well there's there's evidence

5292.82 --> 5297.679999999999
that they lie to get into the positions

5295.07 --> 5300.44
they get into there's there's your

5297.68 --> 5304.58
typical lies broken promises to get into

5300.44 --> 5306.08
a position of power you have two

5304.58 --> 5307.79
candidates that are running against each

5306.08 --> 5309.98
other and both candidates know that the

5307.79 --> 5312.14
other candidate is lying and then you

5309.98 --> 5313.73
multiply that times four times eight or

5312.14 --> 5317.09
whatever and they each get it they're

5313.73 --> 5319.7
all lying in a different area you know

5317.09 --> 5322.25
but they get caught out that's the thing

5319.7 --> 5325.78
you can see that right but then that

5322.25 --> 5328.91
goes back to our questions you why

5325.78 --> 5330.23
thought out I don't know that you can

5328.91 --> 5331.73
let yourself get caught out it's just

5330.23 --> 5335.33
that Liars get caught because of

5331.73 --> 5337.3099999999995
consistencies or well niceness you're

5335.33 --> 5339.89
saying all the space agencies globally

5337.31 --> 5345.47
leak together are lying and they haven't

5339.89 --> 5348.860000000001
been caught out it's not a it's not a

5345.47 --> 5351.83
big media blow out saying look space

5348.86 --> 5353.63
agencies are lying whereas you can look

5351.83 --> 5356.0599999999995
at a politic political system and go

5353.63 --> 5358.28
there's a big media blow out saying this

5356.06 --> 5361.1900000000005
guy lied to get it to get into the

5358.28 --> 5363.98
position of power is it but with space

5361.19 --> 5365.87
agencies there's a bit of bias though

5363.98 --> 5368.959999999999
because every time we say

5365.87 --> 5370.76
they're lying people are pointing and

5368.96 --> 5373.34
laugh at us and say haha look at the

5370.76 --> 5375.4400000000005
little conspiracy theorists all right so

5373.34 --> 5377.39
that's that's the problem that's what we

5375.44 --> 5379.099999999999
have to deal with every time we're

5377.39 --> 5381.5
trying to point things like this out to

5379.1 --> 5386.33
people so if people keep saying that

5381.5 --> 5389.81
what's the chance of being real I mean I

5386.33 --> 5392.3
don't know he told Susie I've heard a

5389.81 --> 5395.570000000001
nasty guy herself there's a NASA guy

5392.3 --> 5397.070000000001
himself who said you know his his

5395.57 --> 5399.65
portrait of the Blue Marble was

5397.07 --> 5401.509999999999
photoshopped because it had to be but

5399.65 --> 5404.509999999999
where is that on the mainstream news you

5401.51 --> 5406.13
don't see that you only see that or when

5404.51 --> 5408.35
you go listen to all the conspiracy

5406.13 --> 5411.41
theories right that's a bit of a red

5408.35 --> 5413.6
herring isn't it I mean you know that

5411.41 --> 5415.13
when people quote that it's taken way

5413.6 --> 5416.990000000001
out of context and if you watch the

5415.13 --> 5418.76
whole video about what he's talking

5416.99 --> 5422.9
about it's quite clearly explained why

5418.76 --> 5423.8
he says what he says okay so I don't

5422.9 --> 5425.87
think you should bring that up

5423.8 --> 5428.6
personally but you can if you like but

5425.87 --> 5430.7
it doesn't lend you any credence well

5428.6 --> 5434.72
I'm just trying to point out to you that

5430.7 --> 5441.32
whenever we are - whenever we go out and

5434.72 --> 5443.360000000001
tell people that there's so no real

5441.32 --> 5445.79
don't point that out to people you know

5443.36 --> 5446.87
where again like I say we're pointed out

5445.79 --> 5448.85
and laughed I didn't say we're

5446.87 --> 5450.14
conspiracy theorists right that's what I

5448.85 --> 5452.75
give them and that comes from the

5450.14 --> 5454.7300000000005
mainstream media that's why you will

5452.75 --> 5459.05
laugh that because you you're pointing

5454.73 --> 5461.03
it out out of context that's why you get

5459.05 --> 5464.45
me into that context all the things that

5461.03 --> 5466.429999999999
we point out or it's quite a shock

5464.45 --> 5470.42
because it has to be you know you better

5466.43 --> 5475.700000000001
than one example that's what that again

5470.42 --> 5478.88
now is that yeah it showed Photoshop as

5475.7 --> 5481.76
the guy said it yeah why who worked for

5478.88 --> 5485.45
NASA said it yeah and what was he

5481.76 --> 5487.7300000000005
describing that they can't make an

5485.45 --> 5490.46
actual picture image of the earth

5487.73 --> 5492.95
because they can only take source of it

5490.46 --> 5495.89
and then Photoshop it together that's

5492.95 --> 5497.24
what it was about it was basically

5495.89 --> 5499.64
denied

5497.24 --> 5501.8
ability of a literal photograph of I'm

5499.64 --> 5504.71
understanding your problem the point is

5501.8 --> 5507.29
that the things you bring up oh so

5504.71 --> 5509.75
you're gonna read her this one - okay

5507.29 --> 5514.34
come on then Newton

5509.75 --> 5516.38
no I want a response so what - my red

5514.34 --> 5520.04
herring yeah no I don't want a red

5516.38 --> 5522.95
herring I want a response to why the my

5520.04 --> 5526.1
declaration of why the guy said what he

5522.95 --> 5530.66
did he said it because he basically new

5526.1 --> 5532.9400000000005
and kind of declared that you can't make

5530.66 --> 5535.46
a single shot photograph of the globe

5532.94 --> 5545.299999999999
earth you have to put it together with

5535.46 --> 5547.76
Photoshop yeah that's a nice beautiful

5545.3 --> 5549.9800000000005
picture of Kirsch he explained that the

5547.76 --> 5552.17
technicality he says - why it's because

5549.98 --> 5554.9
the the satellite that took the photos

5552.17 --> 5556.43
went far away well it wasn't far away

5554.9 --> 5557.99
enough to take a full photo I said they

5556.43 --> 5561.2300000000005
have to take many photos and stitch them

5557.99 --> 5562.94
together like a panoramic view right on

5561.23 --> 5565.009999999999
the camera did you hear the power and

5562.94 --> 5567.29
he's also talking about how he had to

5565.01 --> 5569.18
imagine what it would look like and then

5567.29 --> 5572.0
use different palettes of color for the

5569.18 --> 5575.51
oceans and this yeah like it just came

5572.0 --> 5578.54
out of his brain yeah but then present

5575.51 --> 5580.25
that as a picture of the earth so how am

5578.54 --> 5582.92
I supposed to give that any credibility

5580.25 --> 5585.4
yeah it's an artifice it's not a real

5582.92 --> 5588.29
picture it's an artificial construct

5585.4 --> 5591.98
graft it together with suppose it's

5588.29 --> 5594.47
satellites or spy planes or however it's

5591.98 --> 5596.299999999999
an accurate construct oh yeah sure I

5594.47 --> 5601.01
sure I'm sure you believe it's accurate

5596.3 --> 5605.84
but it's not a literal picture it is a

5601.01 --> 5609.14
construct oh yeah because it's

5605.84 --> 5612.17
photoshopped because it has to be yeah

5609.14 --> 5614.360000000001
it's an accurate construct I'm happy now

5612.17 --> 5616.76
yeah but that that's what you presuppose

5614.36 --> 5618.5599999999995
but I know I still haven't I still

5616.76 --> 5621.530000000001
haven't seen any evidence of a global

5618.56 --> 5624.29
deception well maybe you should open

5621.53 --> 5626.53
your eyes he's been at it for three

5624.29 --> 5626.53
years

5628.44 --> 5635.0199999999995
so I think that's why when you first saw

5632.44 --> 5637.0599999999995
that picture wash can I ask you when you

5635.02 --> 5640.0
first saw that picture did you think it

5637.06 --> 5642.01
was a real picture of Earth when I first

5640.0 --> 5642.64
saw and did it come in a sense a long

5642.01 --> 5647.68
time ago

5642.64 --> 5648.22
I don't know was mister not even sure on

5647.68 --> 5651.52
the year

5648.22 --> 5655.030000000001
but it was a real picture of Earth

5651.52 --> 5658.42
well other than he was a it kind of

5655.03 --> 5662.139999999999
admired that it's much previous pictures

5658.42 --> 5664.75
so yeah I didn't write this yeah so I

5662.14 --> 5666.13
didn't reason now edit yeah I saw it at

5664.75 --> 5666.97
the time I thought it was a real picture

5666.13 --> 5668.77
of Earth too

5666.97 --> 5670.990000000001
I would have never done mmm I would have

5668.77 --> 5674.080000000001
never guessed that somebody put that

5670.99 --> 5675.88
together stitched it together and you

5674.08 --> 5678.12
know thought about what he would like

5675.88 --> 5680.62
the oceans and stuff to look like I

5678.12 --> 5683.32
didn't know time but do you know that

5680.62 --> 5687.01
was Vince is that picture I wasn't told

5683.32 --> 5695.62
that I was yesterday this is this is

5687.01 --> 5697.360000000001
what your earth looks like right so when

5695.62 --> 5700.09
I go into a and I start doing research

5697.36 --> 5702.07
and I find out you know all these things

5700.09 --> 5705.25
are just little stitches of pictures put

5702.07 --> 5707.259999999999
together when all this time all my life

5705.25 --> 5710.29
I'm thinking these are real pictures of

5707.26 --> 5717.280000000001
Earth's that starts to [ __ ] with me man

5710.29 --> 5719.23
so again yeah I mean come on you gotta

5717.28 --> 5731.62
question if it's [ __ ] with you you

5719.23 --> 5733.12
should probably say human I am what what

5731.62 --> 5738.91
do you think earth would look like from

5733.12 --> 5740.17
that altitude do you mean was yeah I can

5738.91 --> 5744.22
hear someone asking [ __ ] hear them

5740.17 --> 5748.71
yeah that's he was it uh was not was

5744.22 --> 5752.2300000000005
yeah would you say you're brainwashed

5748.71 --> 5754.77
would I say I'm brainwash if I was

5752.23 --> 5756.91
brainwashed how would I know are you

5754.77 --> 5758.650000000001
good would you would you say you're

5756.91 --> 5761.08
brainwashed

5758.65 --> 5763.2699999999995
I humbly sir would you say you're

5761.08 --> 5766.98
indoctrinated I have been brainwashed

5763.27 --> 5771.01
yeah do you think you've been rebranded

5766.98 --> 5772.0599999999995
I'm journey but how do you know what

5771.01 --> 5774.01
you're learning isn't part of the

5772.06 --> 5778.84
brainwashing mate come on how far does

5774.01 --> 5784.360000000001
this go you said earlier that you felt

5778.84 --> 5786.13
morally obligated to pay taxes no no

5784.36 --> 5788.62
nuts let's not get into it I'd like to

5786.13 --> 5792.82
stick it to keep it to flatter hey I got

5788.62 --> 5794.59
a funny well no no no no Harwin Darwin

5792.82 --> 5796.509999999999
don't let it go he's he's going back to

5794.59 --> 5798.88
the cot he's going back to the construct

5796.51 --> 5800.530000000001
of dealing with Wasa's justification for

5798.88 --> 5803.17
what he believes I think it's a valid a

5800.53 --> 5806.0199999999995
valid his argument he wants to analyze

5803.17 --> 5810.1
if I'm brainwashed or not right well

5806.02 --> 5813.31
it's my damn show sorry no I will I just

5810.1 --> 5815.5
had an interesting idea about the

5813.31 --> 5818.620000000001
Photoshop because it has to be about

5815.5 --> 5824.949
using the satellites in Earth orbit okay

5818.62 --> 5829.54
so if NASA was able to send a reflector

5824.949 --> 5831.759999999999
device to the moon to reflect radio

5829.54 --> 5834.07
signals to prove that it is physical

5831.76 --> 5836.4400000000005
even though it was already done before

5834.07 --> 5839.349999999999
that and yeah the signal doesn't have

5836.44 --> 5841.8099999999995
the energy to go over the distance and

5839.35 --> 5845.679
reflect back properly but if they could

5841.81 --> 5847.780000000001
do that then why don't they just send a

5845.679 --> 5851.11
freaking drone to be able to make

5847.78 --> 5853.9
photographs of Earth from the moon which

5851.11 --> 5857.11
was well it was that ball remember that

5853.9 --> 5859.089999999999
ball at Horizon so that should be so

5857.11 --> 5862.36
simple why can't they just do that

5859.09 --> 5866.92
quickly why are they are just using the

5862.36 --> 5868.8099999999995
satellites because I can't speak the

5866.92 --> 5872.26
reasons why they're not doing the things

5868.81 --> 5876.219
you want them to do yeah I'd say it's

5872.26 --> 5879.6990000000005
not a major issue to them to appear but

5876.219 --> 5883.69
I think it's amazing people that saw

5879.699 --> 5886.33
that line I can't stand well that nASA

5883.69 --> 5889.629999999999
has no obligations of the people to show

5886.33 --> 5891.5
us what they're doing well let me what

5889.63 --> 5900.3
were the ones paying for the

5891.5 --> 5902.19
yeah no no I missed the moon the voice

5900.3 --> 5903.570000000001
that's asking for this isn't big enough

5902.19 --> 5905.5199999999995
you guys need to get in there and make

5903.57 --> 5907.799999999999
the big noise probably I don't know the

5905.52 --> 5911.4890000000005
answer to that I can only give you

5907.8 --> 5915.3
suggestions if you know the answer do

5911.489 --> 5919.888999999999
something about it all right well if

5915.3 --> 5922.35
they can build a man space project to go

5919.889 --> 5925.05
to Mars blob why don't they just send a

5922.35 --> 5927.9890000000005
freaking satellite drone with radio

5925.05 --> 5930.63
connection to the moon for a 24 hour a

5927.989 --> 5934.468999999999
day livestream of Earth from the moon

5930.63 --> 5936.96
come on would you believe it anyway well

5934.469 --> 5940.56
it would be you know it's like when

5936.96 --> 5942.96
people want to use the National engine

5940.56 --> 5947.1900000000005
NASA doesn't have to tell you anything

5942.96 --> 5949.56
right the problem is it's not that nASA

5947.19 --> 5953.129999999999
has to tell us things is that we know

5949.56 --> 5953.7300000000005
how human beings work right we're all

5953.13 --> 5957.21
human

5953.73 --> 5959.849999999999
we've all seen things on on in this

5957.21 --> 5962.88
world progress right without letting is

5959.85 --> 5966.0
operate they operate on levels right so

5962.88 --> 5967.83
if just logically thinking right common

5966.0 --> 5970.679
sense and I know yeah NASA doesn't have

5967.83 --> 5973.44
to tell me anything right okay but we

5970.679 --> 5975.63
know how this [ __ ] would work right they

5973.44 --> 5978.449
went to the moon they would keep going

5975.63 --> 5980.79
to the moon right why would they stop

5978.449 --> 5984.32
all of a sudden you really believed that

5980.79 --> 5986.46
the whole they destroyed the technology

5984.32 --> 5988.65
come on oh we've been over this the

5986.46 --> 5991.7390000000005
other night if there what's one of the

5988.65 --> 5993.388999999999
other thing is I mean who knows what

5991.739 --> 5997.65
happened with it someone someone either

5993.389 --> 5999.27
oh it's somebody wet you can you can

5997.65 --> 6003.589999999999
rewatch it who knows that someone didn't

5999.27 --> 6008.4490000000005
just make it really bad ah [ __ ] hey it's

6003.59 --> 6011.21
really cool of guys if I can say

6008.449 --> 6014.449
somebody accidentally hit the delete

6011.21 --> 6019.639
button somebody's wife buddy

6014.449 --> 6021.5
accidentally lost a basket in my boxes

6019.639 --> 6024.32
I'm sorry am I

6021.5 --> 6026.54
hmm do you guys have trouble hearing

6024.32 --> 6028.58
each other while you're talking no I can

6026.54 --> 6034.61
hear him talking or than hey just a

6028.58 --> 6037.19
flick to expanding on my answer yeah I

6034.61 --> 6039.92
got it good okay well who nice I mean

6037.19 --> 6042.0199999999995
you know if a conspirators possibly

6039.92 --> 6047.39
think about it let me do it again

6042.02 --> 6049.22
oh no no no there was chocolate yeah

6047.39 --> 6051.47
chocolate has more to say than I do so

6049.22 --> 6053.84
I'll stop all right well if it's really

6051.47 --> 6056.150000000001
urgent then okay but try to stop

6053.84 --> 6058.58
interrupting one now this just breaks

6056.15 --> 6061.67
the flow it's not good we don't we have

6058.58 --> 6065.87
all the time so anyway chocolate what

6061.67 --> 6068.89
what what did you want to say I mean he

6065.87 --> 6072.74
said we did this the other day and I

6068.89 --> 6075.62
tried to go with this in my head before

6072.74 --> 6077.75
because it just it doesn't make sense to

6075.62 --> 6079.97
me that at this point in time we would

6077.75 --> 6083.78
have I don't know how many roses do we

6079.97 --> 6086.84
have on Mars now two three or not we're

6083.78 --> 6089.24
now it's the wire of expertise right so

6086.84 --> 6091.04
that makes that makes logical sense that

6089.24 --> 6093.74
would be so amped to throw all these

6091.04 --> 6096.55
Rovers on Mars but yet the moons right

6093.74 --> 6101.36
here which we've been there and back and

6096.55 --> 6103.1900000000005
not once do we put a rover there you

6101.36 --> 6105.92
don't think after the next year there's

6103.19 --> 6107.78
gonna be 50 years I thought the song is

6105.92 --> 6111.53
we haven't we haven't put a rover on the

6107.78 --> 6113.69
moon but but but man walked up there and

6111.53 --> 6116.42
drove the dune buggy and play golf and

6113.69 --> 6119.599999999999
talk to Richard Nixon on the landline so

6116.42 --> 6123.32
what does all of that on the moon but no

6119.6 --> 6125.27
rules words to say again what did the

6123.32 --> 6128.12
Chinese didn't I recently put something

6125.27 --> 6130.75
like there I'm not I'm not clear on the

6128.12 --> 6132.14
detail with what they did

6130.75 --> 6135.26
[Music]

6132.14 --> 6137.780000000001
I heard about some satellite or

6135.26 --> 6141.29
something that they put I mean uh some

6137.78 --> 6144.74
some Rover thingy but I mean that's as

6141.29 --> 6146.6
much credibility as NASA because where's

6144.74 --> 6148.2699999999995
the fanfare of that what happened to

6146.6 --> 6150.889
that this was sitting up there now

6148.27 --> 6153.619000000001
mm-hmm

6150.889 --> 6156.53
I mean where is the progress this is

6153.619 --> 6158.449
what I'm saying how do we have a rover

6156.53 --> 6162.28
that's that's still working up there on

6158.449 --> 6167.2699999999995
Mars but well the moon is right here and

6162.28 --> 6169.82
we just I mean I can't understand how

6167.27 --> 6172.01
thanks why huh

6169.82 --> 6175.3099999999995
it's like chump change you reckon

6172.01 --> 6177.2300000000005
together the moon it shouldn't be I

6175.31 --> 6179.869000000001
think the firemen we've had we've had

6177.23 --> 6183.259999999999
satellites that we sent out there and I

6179.869 --> 6185.869
don't know late 70s 80s early 80s that

6183.26 --> 6192.38
just pass the Pluto and [ __ ] still able

6185.869 --> 6194.929
to sub transmit from a thousand miles or

6192.38 --> 6199.58
our trajectory right a sideward

6194.929 --> 6201.889
photograph crystal crisp clear beautiful

6199.58 --> 6204.07
picture from the machine that we sent

6201.889 --> 6207.02
out in the in the seventies eighties

6204.07 --> 6210.909
well it might seems better but but

6207.02 --> 6213.1990000000005
filling an astronomical speeds and

6210.909 --> 6216.44
photographing it not straight on but

6213.199 --> 6218.928999999999
sideways so imagine what happens when

6216.44 --> 6233.69
you take a picture while moving at

6218.929 --> 6238.219
astronomical speeds it's tedious

6233.69 --> 6240.32
yeah well it's tedious when I mean I

6238.219 --> 6244.4890000000005
don't know how you guys feel like I even

6240.32 --> 6246.44
before Flat Earth I as a globe air was

6244.489 --> 6247.968999999999
disappointed in NASA before I started

6246.44 --> 6251.449
learning how really full of [ __ ] they

6247.969 --> 6253.07
are I was disappointed as [ __ ] because I

6251.449 --> 6254.57
just did this [ __ ] I wanted to see when

6253.07 --> 6256.099999999999
I was a bull but I want to see [ __ ] on

6254.57 --> 6258.29
the more I want to see where's the first

6256.1 --> 6260.4800000000005
woman where's the first dog where's the

6258.29 --> 6262.4
where's all of that why are we not going

6260.48 --> 6264.23
back all of a sudden no no we just

6262.4 --> 6265.54
destroyed all the technology and we're

6264.23 --> 6270.08
just gonna leave it at that

6265.54 --> 6270.8
and now NASA astronauts and ISS

6270.08 --> 6272.57
astronauts

6270.8 --> 6274.52
I'm sorry Arlen we have them all over

6272.57 --> 6275.78
the place talking about how well we're

6274.52 --> 6278.3
still trying to get out of low Earth

6275.78 --> 6280.88
orbit I mean NASA can't even get their

6278.3 --> 6283.860000000001
lives straight so how am I supposed to

6280.88 --> 6288.13
give them any type of credibility

6283.86 --> 6289.869
how how can I do that zooming gun you

6288.13 --> 6291.46
know I'm not I'm not trying I'm not

6289.869 --> 6293.259999999999
looking for mass with my look before

6291.46 --> 6295.659
equations I'm not looking for angular

6293.26 --> 6297.849
[ __ ] size another thing I just want

6295.659 --> 6301.089999999999
to know why the [ __ ] are these things

6297.849 --> 6303.969
not happening that we're paying all this

6301.09 --> 6305.9490000000005
money for and we're told in a fanfare it

6303.969 --> 6307.57
all over the [ __ ] place I got every

6305.949 --> 6310.388999999999
time I turn on my television I got to

6307.57 --> 6330.449
see some space crap but we're doing up

6310.389 --> 6332.38
there you brought up the the monetary

6330.449 --> 6334.57
feasibility of going to the moon you

6332.38 --> 6337.75
said you know how how expensive is it to

6334.57 --> 6340.54
go to the moon you just brought up as a

6337.75 --> 6342.55
possibility yeah look what I saw I'm not

6340.54 --> 6348.489
sure of the reasons that they haven't

6342.55 --> 6350.26
advanced this but you pointed you

6348.489 --> 6354.25
pointed out the fact that it's very

6350.26 --> 6357.88
expensive to go to the moon right now

6354.25 --> 6361.929
believe it is okay ffensive do you think

6357.88 --> 6364.03
it was to launch a red sports car public

6361.929 --> 6365.32
space how it's how less expensive would

6364.03 --> 6367.449
it be just to keep going a little bit

6365.32 --> 6369.579
further to the moon do you think that

6367.449 --> 6372.129999999999
was monetary wise monetarily you know

6369.579 --> 6374.369
why spending to send a sports car up at

6372.13 --> 6376.63
his face was there was there any other

6374.369 --> 6378.579
do you know why they sent that into

6376.63 --> 6380.05
space right that's what I'm asking you

6378.579 --> 6382.869
what was the utility for it yeah go

6380.05 --> 6385.179
ahead what was it do you know oh you're

6382.869 --> 6386.71
just asking me your are you saying you

6385.179 --> 6388.2390000000005
already know and you're just testing me

6386.71 --> 6392.05
or do you are you asking me because you

6388.239 --> 6394.57
don't know as far as I know because I

6392.05 --> 6396.46
don't watch the news the only thing that

6394.57 --> 6399.19
I've come away with is the fact that

6396.46 --> 6403.119
they simply sent a sports car to space

6399.19 --> 6405.4
so is there any leti so you don't know

6403.119 --> 6406.808999999999
you don't know any other reason why

6405.4 --> 6408.429
they're not right that's right right

6406.809 --> 6410.59
yeah so what are you asking because you

6408.429 --> 6412.96
don't know that's correct

6410.59 --> 6416.709
you're not asking me to like test me or

6412.96 --> 6418.389
something that's correct I don't know

6416.709 --> 6420.159
I just I just want to get the right

6418.389 --> 6421.4490000000005
angle of your question because I'm just

6420.159 --> 6428.438999999999
trying to have a discussion with you

6421.449 --> 6430.928999999999
blades sure I read that when they do

6428.439 --> 6432.610000000001
test those heavy lifts of rockets they

6430.929 --> 6435.969
usually send up like a big block of

6432.61 --> 6439.03
concrete or something to add the weight

6435.969 --> 6441.459
to the to the payload to see if

6439.03 --> 6445.42
everything works as it should and and

6441.459 --> 6449.65
rather than putting a dead weight in it

6445.42 --> 6452.7390000000005
I just put a car in there because he has

6449.65 --> 6453.999
plenty of cars he's a bit eccentric and

6452.739 --> 6459.249
he thought maybe he thought it'd be a

6453.999 --> 6461.17
bit of fun as well okay but again that

6459.249 --> 6464.61
has so you're saying that they're trying

6461.17 --> 6468.07
to figure out the telemetry data of

6464.61 --> 6471.938999999999
launching a certain amount of mass into

6468.07 --> 6481.929
space I guess yeah yeah that's what I

6471.939 --> 6484.349
bred it sounded plausible okay no I'm

6481.929 --> 6484.349
glad I could help

6488.81 --> 6497.4800000000005
and and you buy that car car in space

6493.99 --> 6500.54
was I didn't pay for it so I got it for

6497.48 --> 6503.15
free did it and did it look good

6500.54 --> 6505.79
slightly wonky to that the car in space

6503.15 --> 6507.95
with the dummy inside and well has it

6505.79 --> 6508.58
supposed has a car in spice supposed to

6507.95 --> 6511.429999999999
look like

6508.58 --> 6513.17
up next senile old man but I went to

6511.43 --> 6515.360000000001
work that day and there were there were

6513.17 --> 6518.45
ballers there were people who had no

6515.36 --> 6520.16
idea idea cloud Rose was even the thing

6518.45 --> 6523.55
and we're looking at me like yo this

6520.16 --> 6526.25
looks like crap this is so cartoonish

6523.55 --> 6530.24
what the hell is going on here oh you

6526.25 --> 6531.98
know I mean so I I didn't think it was

6530.24 --> 6534.65
supposed to be real I didn't know that

6531.98 --> 6537.0199999999995
that was supposed to happen and I'm

6534.65 --> 6541.73
looking I'm like what the hell is why is

6537.02 --> 6544.1900000000005
there a car from Earth hey cuz I'm

6541.73 --> 6546.799999999999
looking at a newspaper on my way to work

6544.19 --> 6550.969999999999
and I'm like all right whatever I did

6546.8 --> 6553.9400000000005
well hot dory I don't know what video

6550.97 --> 6557.240000000001
recording equipment they used for the

6553.94 --> 6560.629999999999
clarity of imagery that got I don't know

6557.24 --> 6564.23
what a car in space would look like do

6560.63 --> 6566.81
you became particularly fairly dunno

6564.23 --> 6569.54
okay so there's a 50/50 chance that it

6566.81 --> 6571.7300000000005
is real in but you don't know and I

6569.54 --> 6581.84
don't know yet we've shown that that is

6571.73 --> 6584.089999999999
a 50 chance that the is real he sorted

6581.84 --> 6586.64
he's I was just asking because it did it

6584.09 --> 6590.96
look even playing the suspect juice I

6586.64 --> 6598.490000000001
mean it it looked like video from the

6590.96 --> 6600.95
90s to me yeah you know I don't know if

6598.49 --> 6604.79
you when when you record something on

6600.95 --> 6610.67
video tape it's what that I'm not I'm

6604.79 --> 6612.11
not a video that it's got a plate it

6610.67 --> 6614.81
looks sort of flat eesh or something

6612.11 --> 6616.07
there it doesn't you know when you film

6614.81 --> 6619.490000000001
something on when you record something

6616.07 --> 6621.799999999999
on film it's got more realistic sort of

6619.49 --> 6622.7
feel about it but when you recorded on

6621.8 --> 6625.67
the old VH

6622.7 --> 6627.08
tapes it had that sort of we had liked

6625.67 --> 6633.74
to it that made it look more flat I

6627.08 --> 6636.08
suppose pardon the pun so it kind of

6633.74 --> 6639.41
looked a bit more like it was filmed an

6636.08 --> 6643.1
old video videotape or VHS to me so I

6639.41 --> 6645.86
don't know what what video recording on

6643.1 --> 6654.83
imagery image capturing devices they use

6645.86 --> 6659.36
that I'm not sure yeah yeah I don't know

6654.83 --> 6662.09
I just yeah so do i I mean I mean it's

6659.36 --> 6663.62
yeah that's true enough I I could ask a

6662.09 --> 6664.67
lot of questions - I mean that's what

6663.62 --> 6667.849999999999
it's all about trying to get an

6664.67 --> 6669.56
understanding I just want to go back I

6667.85 --> 6671.96
just want to go back a little bit

6669.56 --> 6675.35
because again I'm trying to understand

6671.96 --> 6680.3
this so you're telling me that they

6675.35 --> 6682.400000000001
launched a red sports car that was I'll

6680.3 --> 6685.1
say one not even a ton

6682.4 --> 6687.469999999999
I'm telling what already I know but but

6685.1 --> 6692.68
why I'm saying okay now I'm trying to

6687.47 --> 6695.21
assess the fact that that 2,000 pounds

6692.68 --> 6697.490000000001
was enough of a difference of a

6695.21 --> 6701.21
difference for them to not be sure how

6697.49 --> 6704.389999999999
to have accurate telemetry so they're

6701.21 --> 6706.94
like okay we've got this space rocket

6704.39 --> 6708.89
ready to go but we're not really sure

6706.94 --> 6711.259999999999
what the payload is gonna be able to

6708.89 --> 6714.08
carry and how fast it's gonna go and

6711.26 --> 6718.22
where it's gonna go I don't know those

6714.08 --> 6719.15
questions I donate right right yeah got

6718.22 --> 6723.71
going sorry

6719.15 --> 6726.53
I waited budding but I just hear when

6723.71 --> 6729.58
you when you ask things like that I'm

6726.53 --> 6732.889999999999
kind of hearing things that you making

6729.58 --> 6734.66
assumptions on you know I'm just trying

6732.89 --> 6735.83
to process the information you gave me

6734.66 --> 6741.26
because that was the first time I heard

6735.83 --> 6743.6
it yeah you're processing all your means

6741.26 --> 6747.17
of processing when you verbalize it I

6743.6 --> 6748.700000000001
just hear a lot of presumption okay what

6747.17 --> 6749.2
what give me an example of what I was

6748.7 --> 6752.66
presuming

6749.2 --> 6754.639999999999
karyam you're presuming they're asking

6752.66 --> 6755.94
questions that with well we've built

6754.64 --> 6757.89
this rocket now can it

6755.94 --> 6761.58
she handled that way that's what you

6757.89 --> 6770.030000000001
told me they were doing no that's not

6761.58 --> 6774.42
what you told me I told you what I read

6770.03 --> 6776.07
okay why don't you read Lee okay so what

6774.42 --> 6780.06
they what I read was with what they

6776.07 --> 6781.32
normally do is launch a wait in the

6780.06 --> 6785.46
rocket because it's a heavy lifting

6781.32 --> 6788.219
rocket apparently so there if I go into

6785.46 --> 6790.26
more detail so they've got the

6788.219 --> 6792.09
calculations on what the rock can do and

6790.26 --> 6794.280000000001
what its thing is so they put the weight

6792.09 --> 6796.2300000000005
in there to make sure it all adds up and

6794.28 --> 6800.34
works out but it's still fusing concrete

6796.23 --> 6801.36
they use the car yeah okay so I don't

6800.34 --> 6803.55
really think that I'm gonna change

6801.36 --> 6806.4
anything that I've said and mine again

6803.55 --> 6811.1990000000005
is my point again is is that it seems to

6806.4 --> 6814.849999999999
me quite frivolous to send up a rocket

6811.199 --> 6817.11
to test 2,000 pounds worth of weight

6814.85 --> 6820.77
okay well maybe I'll read it wrong then

6817.11 --> 6823.91
maybe there's more to it well like I

6820.77 --> 6827.76
said the only entry okay

6823.91 --> 6830.28
what I'm going to say is my impression

6827.76 --> 6833.67
from the media coverage that I watched

6830.28 --> 6836.79
was that they just simply launched a red

6833.67 --> 6839.67
sports car into space that's what I took

6836.79 --> 6842.79
away from it and all of the media in all

6839.67 --> 6845.82
of the media coverage I got I did not

6842.79 --> 6848.1
ever detect them saying now we know that

6845.82 --> 6850.86
adding two thousand pounds to the mass

6848.1 --> 6852.660000000001
weight to the gross weight huh that's

6850.86 --> 6855.54
not what I heard I didn't hear that

6852.66 --> 6858.239
either from the media coverage of Rex

6855.54 --> 6862.489
you talk when you say media coverage are

6858.239 --> 6867.9
you talking about like TV media sort of

6862.489 --> 6873.299999999999
print media telemetry so that does that

6867.9 --> 6877.3099999999995
include print media I don't know oh well

6873.3 --> 6880.34
this on online as well

6877.31 --> 6882.77
yeah yeah it just seems a little bit

6880.34 --> 6886.13
silly to me hey you know 50 years ago

6882.77 --> 6889.43
they could build oh no 50 years ago they

6886.13 --> 6891.47
could build a Schwinn that could you

6889.43 --> 6894.77
know take its time and get up a mountain

6891.47 --> 6895.85
and now we've got a harley-davidson that

6894.77 --> 6897.530000000001
we can build and get up there a whole

6895.85 --> 6899.200000000001
lot faster but we can't get to the moon

6897.53 --> 6904.49
that just it seems a little bit

6899.2 --> 6907.61
nonsensical and it's it he doesn't suit

6904.49 --> 6910.4
you go yeah hey guys I want to do a

6907.61 --> 6913.91
shout out to some people in chat Nathan

6910.4 --> 6916.5199999999995
oh please he's doing the housekeeping

6913.91 --> 6918.44
questions on certain trolls and chat

6916.52 --> 6923.4400000000005
that I can't see because I got that

6918.44 --> 6931.969999999999
block so yeah shout out to you Nathan

6923.44 --> 6938.839999999999
shouts out refracted shout outs you know

6931.97 --> 6943.45
a talk in China what hold on guys for

6938.84 --> 6943.45
just want to do a few minutes of a

6943.48 --> 6946.94
little lot because we've gone for two

6946.4 --> 6949.57
hours now

6946.94 --> 6953.0599999999995
yeah I'm not planning to stop

6949.57 --> 6955.849999999999
necessarily anytime soon may go on for

6953.06 --> 6959.3
an hour maybe even longer but yeah I am

6955.85 --> 6963.17
sorry if you guys could mute for a

6959.3 --> 6965.12
second all right so yeah thanks everyone

6963.17 --> 6967.37
for coming so far and thank you for the

6965.12 --> 6970.79
panel members Bailey was a chocolate

6967.37 --> 6974.66
saying I ran tea Red Hen radio and was

6970.79 --> 6975.95
for making yeah this flat earth vs. bowl

6974.66 --> 6978.44
debates it possible it's very

6975.95 --> 6980.2699999999995
interesting I like it and thank you

6978.44 --> 6982.3099999999995
everyone in chat for coming please don't

6980.27 --> 6983.900000000001
forget to subscribe to my channel if you

6982.31 --> 6987.71
haven't already and check if you are

6983.9 --> 6992.28
still subscribe and also about the video

6987.71 --> 6995.44
if you liked it and yeah let's

6992.28 --> 7000.239
the flowers early words conversation

6995.44 --> 7002.46
continued so you'll see you guys now I'm

7000.239 --> 7006.209999999999
going to be my first premier today at 7

7002.46 --> 7008.31
p.m. UK time so I've just finished

7006.21 --> 7011.31
uploading the video now so probably what

7008.31 --> 7016.830000000001
about the four hours from now I'll be

7011.31 --> 7023.1900000000005
doing my first premier cool very cool

7016.83 --> 7027.57
very cool and the year you've got to do

7023.19 --> 7030.95
it I don't you really do a nice gotta go

7027.57 --> 7030.95
out with a bit hang out on the year

7034.4 --> 7039.949
just want to say Happy New Year that

7036.23 --> 7041.78
everybody man even even the trolls even

7039.949 --> 7048.678999999999
the ballers they hate us Happy New Year

7041.78 --> 7053.389999999999
[ __ ] sorry I'm so mad that's

7048.679 --> 7055.34
right oh man seriously yo where we're

7053.39 --> 7058.46
all I hear we're all looking for truth I

7055.34 --> 7060.679
mean some people are a bit troller than

7058.46 --> 7062.36
others and you know some people just

7060.679 --> 7063.89
actually believe what they believe and

7062.36 --> 7066.679
that's cool everybody's allowed to

7063.89 --> 7068.12
believe what they want I just I don't

7066.679 --> 7071.3
think it's right to try to shut other

7068.12 --> 7073.09
people down for asking questions you

7071.3 --> 7077.09
know sorry guys I think it a drink

7073.09 --> 7080.84
gotta stay lubricated yeah why are you

7077.09 --> 7090.14
drinking I'm drinking fireball whiskey

7080.84 --> 7095.96
it's cinnamon infused I'm in Melbourne

7090.14 --> 7098.5
it's 2:00 a.m. so Australia yeah

7095.96 --> 7100.67
Melbourne Australia let's see we're on

7098.5 --> 7104.15
the southern here yes actually that

7100.67 --> 7106.04
upside down right now ah so relative our

7104.15 --> 7113.8099999999995
original you blokes website damn tasty

7106.04 --> 7115.85
but it isn't yeah explicitly both either

7113.81 --> 7118.34
way we're both looking to it to the side

7115.85 --> 7119.929
of the ball right well its perspective

7118.34 --> 7120.4400000000005
isn't it your perspective is your

7119.929 --> 7125.26
reality

7120.44 --> 7130.78
no no perspective is just the optics now

7125.26 --> 7136.070000000001
I'm filming the other reality okay

7130.78 --> 7137.36
no not the opticals perspective so how

7136.07 --> 7143.09
can we have a guest pressure with their

7137.36 --> 7148.8189999999995
to container well you can have it but

7143.09 --> 7152.619000000001
not for a very long time okay

7148.819 --> 7155.329000000001
and how long how long is a long time

7152.619 --> 7157.639
very short actually well I mean how long

7155.329 --> 7160.398999999999
is first and flying around in the

7157.639 --> 7165.709
universe anyway it's a straight towards

7160.399 --> 7166.519
you gonna get a long time yeah corty

7165.709 --> 7171.159
according to us

7166.519 --> 7171.159000000001
yeah yeah yeah not a very long one

7171.76 --> 7176.479
relatively speaking not a very long time

7174.019 --> 7179.349
sir I doubt I just don't see it

7176.479 --> 7182.299
look unless there is some kind of

7179.349 --> 7183.919
enhanced gravity barrier position where

7182.299 --> 7187.609
gravity suddenly becomes really really

7183.919 --> 7190.398999999999
strong to prevent yeah the gas from

7187.609 --> 7191.839
leaking out then it's yeah it's not

7190.399 --> 7193.4890000000005
gonna happen there's not gonna be a

7191.839 --> 7196.0689999999995
vacuum up there that's the only other

7193.489 --> 7198.199
option do you think do you think the

7196.069 --> 7201.709000000001
powers that be whoever they are know

7198.199 --> 7202.999
that there is contain a membrane what do

7201.709 --> 7205.909
you think we've not discovered it yet

7202.999 --> 7208.639
well they certainly have narrowed down

7205.909 --> 7213.8589999999995
the options they certainly will know

7208.639 --> 7217.969
about what it will not be so what could

7213.859 --> 7225.679
it be made of what could it be what are

7217.969 --> 7226.449
you talking a barrier Yeah right okay

7225.679 --> 7230.059
fine

7226.449 --> 7232.518999999999
well maybe it could be a flat top it

7230.059 --> 7235.809
could be the bottom of our earth could

7232.519 --> 7240.619000000001
just be rock it could be no it'd be

7235.809 --> 7243.669
maybe some kind of solidified gas or

7240.619 --> 7246.139
something I don't know I have no idea

7243.669 --> 7248.539
what's the little part guys know you

7246.139 --> 7252.499
thank you yeah there's all kinds of

7248.539 --> 7254.5689999999995
stories about this speculations you know

7252.499 --> 7259.219
it all depends on the temperature over

7254.569 --> 7261.229
there and yeah what how many if you're

7259.219 --> 7263.209
going to say we can't have I guess

7261.229 --> 7268.909000000001
pressure without a container we have to

7263.209 --> 7270.648999999999
take that steps and steps further we

7268.909 --> 7274.598999999999
can't have a guest pressure without a

7270.649 --> 7274.599
container within the Earth's atmosphere

7277.43 --> 7282.87
as far as we know that's the only way

7280.05 --> 7285.3
we've been able to test no but no no but

7282.87 --> 7288.54
if there has been to interspace to test

7285.3 --> 7290.64
it there's an antecedent a container is

7288.54 --> 7292.83
the antecedent for gas pressure that's

7290.64 --> 7296.34
the e but no one's know no one's no

7292.83 --> 7298.0199999999995
player has been to space to really test

7296.34 --> 7304.5
it properly yeah but that doesn't take

7298.02 --> 7306.84
away the antecedent element well if you

7304.5 --> 7309.18
haven't gone into space to test that how

7306.84 --> 7312.08
do you know you can't take away the

7309.18 --> 7315.93
antecedent well because if you try to

7312.08 --> 7317.07
emulate it it's not gonna work out but

7315.93 --> 7318.570000000001
how do you know that you haven't been

7317.07 --> 7320.67
into space with the right equipment to

7318.57 --> 7323.04
try and emulate it properly well the

7320.67 --> 7327.39
thing is with modeling you can try to do

7323.04 --> 7329.61
it in small scale so every attempt there

7327.39 --> 7333.08
is no vacuum no matter what forces you

7329.61 --> 7337.5599999999995
apply even in the model sorry fugal

7333.08 --> 7339.75
setup where it is absurd ly extreme the

7337.56 --> 7346.950000000001
forces applying they're still not gonna

7339.75 --> 7351.69
be any vacuum win okay so it's it's okay

7346.95 --> 7353.91
to model things in my opinion it's not

7351.69 --> 7355.53
very good scientific evidence because

7353.91 --> 7360.66
that still requires the scientific

7355.53 --> 7363.03
method but I go with models i sized them

7360.66 --> 7366.389999999999
up for a percentage of value in the

7363.03 --> 7369.2699999999995
wider structure of the reality it's a

7366.39 --> 7372.8
they're a good little predictive tool to

7369.27 --> 7376.110000000001
see the good little tool to see few

7372.8 --> 7378.93
assumptions all right no it's a good

7376.11 --> 7380.82
little size them up how much of a value

7378.93 --> 7383.01
they will have in the wider structure

7380.82 --> 7386.849999999999
doesn't it the moment if it's true or

7383.01 --> 7391.89
not yeah

7386.85 --> 7396.02
okay general if it works that doesn't

7391.89 --> 7396.02
make it true it just means that it works

7396.17 --> 7401.37
what the more these assumptions of why

7398.64 --> 7413.22
it works that's it's not a that's not a

7401.37 --> 7417.93
given it appears to work observation in

7413.22 --> 7419.9400000000005
reality when I look at the sky in the

7417.93 --> 7423.63
Sun City I mean I've got a few videos on

7419.94 --> 7425.5199999999995
my my channel where I was a little most

7423.63 --> 7426.83
recent when I was up on the factory roof

7425.52 --> 7432.6
at work

7426.83 --> 7435.0
filming the sunset and where it was

7432.6 --> 7437.9400000000005
setting was quite quite nice and quite

7435.0 --> 7439.41
good all the clouds were lit up but on

7437.94 --> 7442.379999999999
the opposite side to where it was

7439.41 --> 7446.66
sitting and all the way around the

7442.38 --> 7450.42
horizon of my the horizon I I could see

7446.66 --> 7453.42
there was a clear orange band and the

7450.42 --> 7456.42
clouds on the west were lit from

7453.42 --> 7459.81
underneath with sunless city and éclairs

7456.42 --> 7464.61
on the east will live as well but the

7459.81 --> 7467.070000000001
clouds above were not right so that

7464.61 --> 7470.7
would suggest that if we have a at home

7467.07 --> 7472.2
I'm gonna go say the don't to me it

7470.7 --> 7475.09
looked like the dome is just around me

7472.2 --> 7477.38
you know quite a few kilometers around

7475.09 --> 7480.4400000000005
[Music]

7477.38 --> 7485.25
you are physically literal acting again

7480.44 --> 7486.169999999999
but we if I if the Sun was from your

7485.25 --> 7489.96
position

7486.17 --> 7493.17
horizon then the apparent light that

7489.96 --> 7497.16
light coming from you will shine upon

7493.17 --> 7499.08
that from yeah on things the way they're

7497.16 --> 7501.389999999999
in position in relation to the observer

7499.08 --> 7503.49
if the observers actually in a totally

7501.39 --> 7505.68
different location looking at that same

7503.49 --> 7510.239
region you're staring at they will not

7505.68 --> 7512.530000000001
see the same things of course not right

7510.239 --> 7514.478999999999
yeah that's just stating the obvious I

7512.53 --> 7516.4
know that it's just a local apparition

7514.479 --> 7520.599
the Sun disc is an apparition

7516.4 --> 7522.789
it's an apparition yeah but we when when

7520.599 --> 7527.979
we look at what the clerk says it was it

7522.789 --> 7531.07
explains it succinctly not really mm-hmm

7527.979 --> 7533.1990000000005
no it's just a structure to account for

7531.07 --> 7536.65
the physical physical literalist

7533.199 --> 7539.558999999999
approach of all these things to fight a

7536.65 --> 7542.018999999999
space you can work out kind of it

7539.559 --> 7544.209
doesn't really the explosion the

7542.019 --> 7547.900000000001
explanation that the globe has for that

7544.209 --> 7551.949
is much more simple you have to employ

7547.9 --> 7556.478999999999
all sorts of themes to explain it like

7551.949 --> 7557.049999999999
an apparition and locations we know all

7556.479 --> 7561.820000000001
about it

7557.05 --> 7563.079000000001
we know yeah yeah we know for a second I

7561.82 --> 7564.249
win you don't have to say I don't have

7563.079 --> 7565.389
to say anything I just want to show

7564.249 --> 7576.88
something to the audience

7565.389 --> 7579.659000000001
yeah sure no there we go I'll just leave

7576.88 --> 7579.659000000001
that up for a minute

7582.8 --> 7595.46
oh how do I give people a spammer this

7590.719 --> 7601.94
guy supposed to be a teacher to register

7595.46 --> 7605.15
one of these in his live streams oh it's

7601.94 --> 7607.879999999999
all right grantie I once been a was here

7605.15 --> 7609.138999999999
when he started as well so I didn't lock

7607.88 --> 7610.969
I didn't laugh at all when though I

7609.139 --> 7613.42
tried to help him but you carry on Mike

7610.969 --> 7615.469
no thank you thank you for your help

7613.42 --> 7616.369
yeah I was trying to help you but you

7615.469 --> 7619.7300000000005
carry on Randy

7616.369 --> 7621.23
you'd be the big man move on that's

7619.73 --> 7623.9
alright you carry on guys now I'm just

7621.23 --> 7629.119
trolling today

7623.9 --> 7636.46
good on you Mike ya know it's funny it's

7629.119 --> 7639.4
always silly no matter come on nenenene

7636.46 --> 7642.29
that was Randy anyway well where were we

7639.4 --> 7645.379999999999
apparitions yeah the apparition of the

7642.29 --> 7647.3
Sun disc yes yes which is

7645.38 --> 7650.6900000000005
holographically there to the observer

7647.3 --> 7652.88
like a hologram for them and that

7650.69 --> 7655.669999999999
apparent position with all the light

7652.88 --> 7658.76
effects that come form the implications

7655.67 --> 7663.679
of what you are saying are intense yeah

7658.76 --> 7666.26
it is whereas the what with what we've

7663.679 --> 7667.429
got explained to us by the global model

7666.26 --> 7669.2300000000005
isn't so intense it's quite

7667.429 --> 7671.179
straightforward and simple no to

7669.23 --> 7674.03
understand no it doesn't make any sense

7671.179 --> 7675.829
no look no it doesn't listen it's one

7674.03 --> 7678.469
lesson

7675.829 --> 7679.84
crepuscular rays and this is not what

7678.469 --> 7683.78
you think it's gonna be

7679.84 --> 7687.110000000001
crepuscular rays they are holographic as

7683.78 --> 7690.86
well tell you why because if you look at

7687.11 --> 7693.489
these lights from the clouds right they

7690.86 --> 7696.949
are this kind of weird

7693.489 --> 7698.54
yeah like suggesting it's very close I'm

7696.949 --> 7700.879999999999
not even saying that it is very close it

7698.54 --> 7703.94
just appears to be that way but excuse

7700.88 --> 7706.639
me again ho I'm not done and I will tell

7703.94 --> 7710.239
you when I'm done then another observer

7706.639 --> 7713.6900000000005
from say ten miles away looks at that

7710.239 --> 7715.37
same location and they will not see

7713.69 --> 7718.79
those beams of light they

7715.37 --> 7720.86
hitting everything from a distance even

7718.79 --> 7724.28
if they're looking down at it from a

7720.86 --> 7728.509999999999
mountain walk around the Sun to them is

7724.28 --> 7731.15
not in that position that like a wine

7728.51 --> 7733.55
bar is how it happens because it is a

7731.15 --> 7736.879999999999
holographic apparition and the beams

7733.55 --> 7740.45
that come from it they are guided by the

7736.88 --> 7741.41
same concept is the Sun of them are the

7740.45 --> 7747.47
Sun and the moon

7741.41 --> 7749.12
holographic yes generations they're not

7747.47 --> 7751.43
evil basical objects

7749.12 --> 7757.4
do you believe holographs can have

7751.43 --> 7760.72
physical properties no so how do we

7757.4 --> 7763.429999999999
bounce those lasers of them of them in a

7760.72 --> 7766.490000000001
hologram is an apparition it's not

7763.43 --> 7769.700000000001
really the light beam a light beam yeah

7766.49 --> 7773.09
that transfers energy the hologram is an

7769.7 --> 7775.67
effect it's an apparition just appears

7773.09 --> 7777.9800000000005
there it's not really there it's not

7775.67 --> 7780.14
read you won't read any energies coming

7777.98 --> 7783.349999999999
from it but the source that's creating

7780.14 --> 7786.650000000001
it that will register in energy because

7783.35 --> 7789.740000000001
it is lights the apparition itself is

7786.65 --> 7792.889999999999
not it's just an apparition that's a

7789.74 --> 7796.16
faster source we don't know I don't know

7792.89 --> 7797.72
so speculations about it it's just wild

7796.16 --> 7800.63
speculation at this point several

7797.72 --> 7804.610000000001
approaches actually one yeah be the

7800.63 --> 7808.07
sound based other would be yeah

7804.61 --> 7811.599999999999
electrostatics with a side effect

7808.07 --> 7813.98
optical side effect of electrostatics

7811.6 --> 7816.4400000000005
who knows there's all kinds of

7813.98 --> 7820.459999999999
approaches but the holographic nature is

7816.44 --> 7823.46
very apparent and testable I've seen the

7820.46 --> 7826.52
footage I've seen others do this from a

7823.46 --> 7827.57
feed core I believe it was guy's name

7826.52 --> 7830.67
again

7827.57 --> 7833.4
but he showed this of the nature of the

7830.67 --> 7836.4890000000005
crepuscular rays and how they indeed do

7833.4 --> 7838.589999999999
not they are in a different day they are

7836.489 --> 7841.799999999999
not visible they could be visible from

7838.59 --> 7844.29
one location and if somebody else looks

7841.8 --> 7846.81
from another place to that literal

7844.29 --> 7848.699
location then they're not gonna see the

7846.81 --> 7853.610000000001
same things because the Sun to them

7848.699 --> 7856.739
isn't in another position that's just

7853.61 --> 7862.349999999999
you can't explain that through your

7856.739 --> 7865.699
physical lateral model now if one sees

7862.35 --> 7869.160000000001
light beams literally hitting spots

7865.699 --> 7871.259999999999
lighting up specific spots with light

7869.16 --> 7874.26
beams from the Sun and then in another

7871.26 --> 7876.66
location the person looks at those spots

7874.26 --> 7879.3
that the one person is looking at and

7876.66 --> 7881.94
they don't see light beams hitting those

7879.3 --> 7884.88
locations you have no explanation for

7881.94 --> 7889.739
that we so what what the physical

7884.88 --> 7891.7390000000005
literal model of the Sun can I ask the

7889.739 --> 7896.669999999999
other panel members what they think

7891.739 --> 7899.099999999999
about this concept of fuels sure what do

7896.67 --> 7904.02
you reckon guys is does that send Farren

7899.1 --> 7907.219
succinct does it sound plausible have

7904.02 --> 7910.9800000000005
you seen the video no one wants that

7907.219 --> 7916.59
no I'll just answer by saying it's no

7910.98 --> 7919.5
less plausible do you recognize the the

7916.59 --> 7923.87
holographic element of pasture-raised oh

7919.5 --> 7923.87
yeah sure there you go

7925.49 --> 7933.5
and what about the Sun and the moon

7927.75 --> 7937.83
being non-physical well I'd say that the

7933.5 --> 7940.47
the crepuscular rays you have to

7937.83 --> 7943.19
introduce a direct indication that that

7940.47 --> 7947.25
is the case because if the light source

7943.19 --> 7950.25
because how they are not fixed then so

7947.25 --> 7954.15
must its source be which is very clear

7950.25 --> 7955.83
by the observer the Sun the Sun is the

7954.15 --> 7965.879999999999
source of the holographic phenomena

7955.83 --> 7968.04
directly and thus on the panel I will

7965.88 --> 7969.71
the other guys on the panel are happy to

7968.04 --> 7972.09
concede that that's a possibility

7969.71 --> 7974.46
because they don't know what the Sun and

7972.09 --> 7977.82
the moon is however they're not happy to

7974.46 --> 7984.09
concede the possibility of the god model

7977.82 --> 7986.49
says ok cause I'm not claiming to know

7984.09 --> 7989.22
it all all I'm claiming is that's right

7986.49 --> 7992.849999999999
I can't claim a holographic aspect of it

7989.22 --> 7996.84
I can claim that I cannot claim however

7992.85 --> 7999.93
a physical aspect of it I'm just that is

7996.84 --> 8001.610000000001
where you two come in and where you need

7999.93 --> 8003.8
to prove that because that is your base

8001.61 --> 8006.83
assumption that is your presupposition

8003.8 --> 8010.79
in your entire model so where is that

8006.83 --> 8014.62
proof of its physicality the actual

8010.79 --> 8018.2
proof in in culture in contrast to my

8014.62 --> 8020.62
proof that it has holographic aspects to

8018.2 --> 8024.349999999999
it I was just trying to point out the

8020.62 --> 8028.84
illogic or theological reasoning to the

8024.35 --> 8028.84
other guys yeah that's a red herring

8029.02 --> 8035.030000000001
yeah okay that you recognize it that

8032.3 --> 8038.33
you're a red herring me Oh me yeah you

8035.03 --> 8041.17
I just propose something to you I can

8038.33 --> 8044.42
claim a holographic aspect to the Sun I

8041.17 --> 8047.6
cannot claim a physical aspect to you to

8044.42 --> 8051.86
the Sun and I don't need to you however

8047.6 --> 8053.570000000001
do because your model uses the physical

8051.86 --> 8055.15
nature of the Sun as a presupposition

8053.57 --> 8059.09
base

8055.15 --> 8062.54
so the evidence you're the one that

8059.09 --> 8067.07
needs to come with this evidence I have

8062.54 --> 8072.86
some evidence that it is holographic but

8067.07 --> 8076.3099999999995
what do you think about to you before

8072.86 --> 8078.44
dinner well but why don't you see it as

8076.31 --> 8082.910000000001
a possibility of an affirming the

8078.44 --> 8085.879999999999
consequent excuse me Cinda yeah Happy

8082.91 --> 8087.86
New Year my Happy New Year I'm going to

8085.88 --> 8089.66
drink like an alpha an hour but I have

8087.86 --> 8090.86
nothing to do until learn so thank you

8089.66 --> 8092.9
very much horrible horrible

8090.86 --> 8096.08
I think house I see as well just like to

8092.9 --> 8097.129999999999
say Happy New Year to him - thank you

8096.08 --> 8104.18
happy New Year to you too

8097.13 --> 8106.9400000000005
long live tortuga earth must be without

8104.18 --> 8112.150000000001
choke oh hi everybody hello cinder all

8106.94 --> 8115.73
of you hi this is it nuta is yours oh

8112.15 --> 8118.219999999999
this is one of my babies yeah oh jeez I

8115.73 --> 8123.679999999999
mean no the new babies but this is one

8118.22 --> 8130.1
year old looking one yeah we are looking

8123.68 --> 8132.650000000001
one oh yeah my wife went to grab me one

8130.1 --> 8136.900000000001
a day one of the puppies they are three

8132.65 --> 8140.2699999999995
weeks three weeks old so what Brady said

8136.9 --> 8143.15
they are a chihuahua this is the oldest

8140.27 --> 8145.76
pure this is nine and a half yeah seven

8143.15 --> 8152.96
and a half and this is the community

8145.76 --> 8154.99
boom oh yeah um Jose I don't want to

8152.96 --> 8158.3
scare you but I do need you to be aware

8154.99 --> 8160.49
there was an issue a news report hearing

8158.3 --> 8162.53
us in Melbourne a few months ago of a

8160.49 --> 8164.66
lady with the Chihuahua he let it out

8162.53 --> 8166.07
into the back garden to have away and a

8164.66 --> 8168.139999999999
raven came down and picked it up and

8166.07 --> 8170.599999999999
flew away with it yep

8168.14 --> 8174.200000000001
I said no I I heard that I have heard of

8170.6 --> 8176.51
that yes a be careful name look how

8174.2 --> 8178.25
about this how about this over for the

8176.51 --> 8181.25
future over now this is a little baby

8178.25 --> 8184.649
girl but weeks old

8181.25 --> 8184.649
[Music]

8189.68 --> 8198.300000000001
like what is going on here

8193.469 --> 8200.73
and just to mention still getting 2/3

8198.3 --> 8202.41
here they're the cutest dogs man just

8200.73 --> 8204.32
imagine I say she doesn't know what

8202.41 --> 8216.66
shape the earth is and she doesn't care

8204.32 --> 8230.369999999999
yeah really cute little cat that just a

8216.66 --> 8243.78
big rat does it meow looks a little like

8230.37 --> 8246.51
you Jose say something are we good no

8243.78 --> 8249.480000000001
we've just had conspiracy cats in on his

8246.51 --> 8252.9
Baldy cats channel he's trying to get

8249.48 --> 8256.23
people to debate him for 200 quid that

8252.9 --> 8258.39
he will donate to a charity of our

8256.23 --> 8260.25
choice so he's offered it to Nathan he's

8258.39 --> 8262.92
offered it to me and essentially I've

8260.25 --> 8265.71
done this I've put it up to us at Baldy

8262.92 --> 8268.59
cats put 100 100 pound admire patreon

8265.71 --> 8271.529999999999
I'll consider your offer if I choose to

8268.59 --> 8272.1
debate I will if not I'll donate it to

8271.53 --> 8274.650000000001
charity

8272.1 --> 8277.56
deal come on big Baldy screenshot that

8274.65 --> 8282.179
so just getting it out there in case he

8277.56 --> 8284.13
tries to manipulate anything so if he

8282.179 --> 8285.0
wants to put $100 in my paper hundred

8284.13 --> 8286.589999999998
pound my patreon

8285.0 --> 8288.42
I will come sit there debating him and

8286.59 --> 8293.04
if I don't feel like I want to debate

8288.42 --> 8295.77
him I'll give it to charity that's fair

8293.04 --> 8297.54
enough deal with it yeah yeah pretty

8295.77 --> 8301.32
good deal yeah indeed look at the other

8297.54 --> 8303.900000000001
one basically there's a charity earth

8301.32 --> 8306.21
ATIS 100% gonna get 100 fans definitely

8303.9 --> 8309.84
yes exactly you mean you're not a

8306.21 --> 8310.589999999998
debating ayah we may yeah I don't have

8309.84 --> 8312.960000000001
to people

8310.59 --> 8314.19
you're not gonna debate my it's gonna

8312.96 --> 8316.919999999998
give the hundred pounds away to a

8314.19 --> 8319.86
charity I can I could debate him all day

8316.92 --> 8322.14
long if I wanted rather I say well how

8319.86 --> 8324.720000000001
does that evidence than he has

8322.14 --> 8326.07
rather than debate him and make it 200

8324.72 --> 8327.15
pounds to charity you're just going to

8326.07 --> 8328.831
not debate him and make it a hundred

8327.15 --> 8330.301
pounds well no I said I would consider

8328.831 --> 8332.041
it I want to see if he's in there you're

8330.301 --> 8333.51
considerate I would consider and you

8332.041 --> 8334.831
won't do it you smartass

8333.51 --> 8336.57
no I want to see if it's a man of his

8334.831 --> 8338.461
words if he's offering up whenever

8336.57 --> 8340.711
there's been money offered up before

8338.461 --> 8342.269999999999
nobody's ever paid so I want to see if

8340.711 --> 8345.06
he's actually gonna follow through with

8342.27 --> 8346.560000000001
putting any money what percentage would

8345.06 --> 8353.49
you put on your consideration that you

8346.56 --> 8355.801
will debate him well I expect a zero

8353.49 --> 8357.69
percent of him put in any kind of money

8355.801 --> 8359.1
into my account before any debate anyway

8357.69 --> 8360.810000000001
so that just proves that it would have

8359.1 --> 8364.53
no intention of paying any money to

8360.81 --> 8367.051
charity anyway this is my way position

8364.53 --> 8378.150000000001
it is but if he proves me wrong then

8367.051 --> 8381.121
he'll go up in my estimation and if the

8378.15 --> 8382.56
extra light did if he did the chances of

8381.121 --> 8389.330999999998
me actually debating it would probably

8382.56 --> 8391.831
go up as well that's more than 50 yeah

8389.331 --> 8395.671
not in chedis he's on his own stream at

8391.831 --> 8398.131
the moment is he I have no idea and

8395.671 --> 8400.471
where did you post this ultimatum to him

8398.131 --> 8402.421
I didn't he was speaking to me in chat

8400.471 --> 8404.850999999999
he challenged me I told him stick him to

8402.421 --> 8406.11
pound him a patreon and Alcoholism it

8404.851 --> 8409.561
was verbal okay fair enough

8406.11 --> 8415.471000000001
yeah it's also on the screenshot in this

8409.561 --> 8418.261
debate okay cool so let the challengers

8415.471 --> 8434.011
continue I uh-huh and whilst the Radek

8418.261 --> 8438.511
can they prove gravity hurricane what

8434.011 --> 8444.721
was tell skeptic that was it King King

8438.511 --> 8446.431
pill skeptic yeah they're good where

8444.721 --> 8448.471
they say is gravity that's it period

8446.431 --> 8452.011
right this is this gas pressure without

8448.471 --> 8454.791
a container yeah I heard in the Mosman

8452.011 --> 8454.791000000001
yesterday yeah

8456.181 --> 8462.61
there's no other thing that can be known

8459.251 --> 8466.181
for that something has to be holding

8462.61 --> 8468.37
this atmosphere quote unquote onto this

8466.181 --> 8474.94
ball while it flies around in a vacuum

8468.37 --> 8484.811000000002
so they have to say that was the proof

8474.94 --> 8487.291000000001
of our was thanks for coming was that

8484.811 --> 8489.641
you have a good night rest them that

come on come on let's get was creeped

8517.15 --> 8521.859999999999
out me yes what is it matter Sony now is

8521.501 --> 8526.751
it

8521.86 --> 8528.7
sorry the flasher is only now no no was

8526.751 --> 8530.291000000001
in they're still here the debate goes

8528.7 --> 8532.181
where it goes and I'm just asking you

8530.291 --> 8539.529999999999
where's she scientific proof of a molten

8532.181 --> 8542.591
iron core at the center of a peaceful

8539.53 --> 8546.131000000001
spherical earth indeed you know it

8542.591 --> 8550.331
better than a yo already you've heard

8546.131 --> 8552.581
this question by 400 time and I only ask

8550.331 --> 8554.711
because this beacon question so have you

8552.581 --> 8558.971
got an answer now come on you got it 400

8554.711 --> 8561.699999999999
times you must have an answer I don't

8558.971 --> 8566.081
but I wanted to say you heard those

8561.7 --> 8568.511
questions so many times to cut like what

8566.081 --> 8572.971
while you would fight against five

8568.511 --> 8577.061
people and have to like dance on a

8572.971 --> 8580.520999999999
spinning disk you could shout those

8577.061 --> 8586.26
questions without any problem

8580.521 --> 8588.12
so well done what so you're in a

8586.26 --> 8590.07
spinning I don't know what how we know

8588.12 --> 8593.460000000001
what the core looks like when it's

8590.07 --> 8595.891
worked out what 4,000 miles down and

8593.46 --> 8597.869999999999
we've only dug eight how do we know how

8595.891 --> 8599.88
do we have a beautiful cartoon picture

8597.87 --> 8603.45
of what the core looks like that's all I

8599.88 --> 8605.9
want to know so we wanna I don't know I

8603.45 --> 8608.641000000001
I know there are people who know the

8605.9 --> 8618.92
geologists for example geophysicist

8608.641 --> 8618.92
and so on yeah I think so what's this I

8620.15 --> 8625.8
don't know what they're doing I just

8624.811 --> 8627.96
know what they're doing

8625.8 --> 8633.75
we're just we're just gonna chop them

8627.96 --> 8636.21
all right cuz the cartoon was in my

8633.75 --> 8638.221
textbook when I was you know in fourth

8636.21 --> 8640.850999999999
grade I should just trust that quick I

8638.221 --> 8650.180999999999
never had the cartoon in my textbook

8640.851 --> 8653.66
sadly oh I'm sorry

8650.181 --> 8656.61
you think he's slow falling are you good

8653.66 --> 8663.42
hey stop that

8656.61 --> 8666.630000000001
I think he's doing where best in the

8663.42 --> 8669.721
states are you chocolate I'm in Georgia

8666.63 --> 8673.529999999999
oh that's that where they film The

8669.721 --> 8677.09
Walking Dead yeah that's nice country

8673.53 --> 8677.09
sorry I like that a lot - look at that

8678.38 --> 8685.55
no idea I came from New York okay

8685.751 --> 8693.101
cinder yeah yes you better start stop

8690.851 --> 8695.351
enough of shutting me out and promoting

8693.101 --> 8698.171
me in the bonus channels saying I want

8695.351 --> 8700.421
the angle of attack guy oh I just

8698.171 --> 8701.891
mentioned you because of your video that

8700.421 --> 8706.11
convinced me to the angle of attack

8701.891 --> 8709.511
hanging like some time ago

8706.11 --> 8719.341
it's kind of an owner and and no good I

8709.511 --> 8722.86
don't like it showing showing your face

8719.341 --> 8728.561
to your enemies it will make them fear

8722.86 --> 8730.78
and cry I cinder I did that yesterday

8728.561 --> 8734.529999999999
are you that you think if they fear me

8730.78 --> 8744.431
yeah I just look Megan alpha I don't

8734.53 --> 8745.811000000002
know I haven't seen your face Amara then

8744.431 --> 8748.24
there was some camera yesterday we'd

8745.811 --> 8750.911
soundly not too dark but you were on

8748.24 --> 8753.311
camera so if the I didn't want to face

8750.911 --> 8759.73
recognition software to recognize my

8753.311 --> 8761.801
face there's a simple solution listen

8759.73 --> 8763.961
you don't feel it you don't realize just

8761.801 --> 8766.48
have to fill a wet recognition too so

8763.961 --> 8768.251
they already got you Xena

8766.48 --> 8770.011
just grow a beard grow a beard mate

8768.251 --> 8778.021
it'll be right I already have a beard

8770.011 --> 8780.161
condi silhouette bigger one is real oh I

8778.021 --> 8788.621000000001
didn't know I didn't hear of it

8780.161 --> 8789.82
I said silhouette recognition so it

8788.621 --> 8791.080999999998
doesn't matter if you were in shadow

8789.82 --> 8794.291
they have your silhouette so they

8791.081 --> 8797.351
already know ah alright I think it was

8794.291 --> 8799.48
pointless done well anyway then I can't

8797.351 --> 8803.341
go next Internet of Things cinder

8799.48 --> 8805.721
Internet of Things I can tap it

8803.341 --> 8808.36
seriously anyone who thinks there is

8805.721 --> 8810.42
some kind of privacy left yeah I think

8808.36 --> 8814.739000000001
again

8810.42 --> 8817.89
and digital device can give just all

8814.739 --> 8820.948999999999
their information away through unusual

8817.89 --> 8825.539999999999
secret routes which doesn't have to be a

8820.949 --> 8826.199
literal internet connection so it's

8825.54 --> 8831.080000000002
hopeless

8826.199 --> 8837.979000000001
yeah but the reasons you can still do it

8831.08 --> 8837.979
because it will matter what I didn't

8840.92 --> 8850.01
hello okay somebody from Skype called me

8855.91 --> 8863.92
so if we don't housekeeping in I don't

8861.76 --> 8864.79
think we're doing housekeeping that's

8863.92 --> 8866.35
nice in sting

8864.79 --> 8868.12
we're on our own show it's up to her and

8866.35 --> 8871.03
if he wants to do that last why I'm

8868.12 --> 8874.149000000001
asking sorry are you scared of are you

8871.03 --> 8875.86
actually scared of how to keep it me no

8874.149 --> 8881.519999999999
I think it's I think it's silly

8875.86 --> 8886.630000000001
why scary why is it just it's just it's

8881.52 --> 8892.050000000001
well it's a bit of line or is it because

8886.63 --> 8905.349999999999
you got no everything so proof is it

8892.05 --> 8908.5
rips a new one in your biloba lease five

8905.35 --> 8911.11
spots all the it's in pain but it's not

8908.5 --> 8914.14
the type of pain you think right oh

8911.11 --> 8918.130000000001
you're taking it the religious way of

8914.14 --> 8920.289999999999
course come on you guys actually are

8918.13 --> 8923.55
mark tears for coming to these debates

8920.29 --> 8926.439
for challenging flat-earthers I get it

8923.55 --> 8928.929999999998
you enjoyed the pain and then ignore it

8926.439 --> 8931.479000000001
let it numb you so you can believe

8928.93 --> 8935.710000000001
forever and ignore all the reality

8931.479 --> 8938.34
arguments channel should have these

8935.71 --> 8941.259999999998
housekeeping questions just ready to go

8938.34 --> 8944.32
any moment every single channel

8941.26 --> 8946.210000000001
everything from marks sergeant when he's

8944.32 --> 8948.25
when he's doing last rim to del to

8946.21 --> 8950.919999999998
anybody with this sort of stuff we've

8948.25 --> 8952.96
got it and you guys can't answer it or

8950.92 --> 8956.08
what but you said before is how about

8952.96 --> 8958.199999999999
zombies get created like having the pain

8956.08 --> 8962.86
and letting Nam you and then like

8958.2 --> 8964.93
wandering solace through the streets not

8962.86 --> 8969.210000000001
not feeling pain not feeling joy not

8964.93 --> 8973.24
feeling anything anymore the pain of

8969.21 --> 8975.88
that no no a religious pain of an

8973.24 --> 8979.539999999999
unanswerable question and you let it

8975.88 --> 8982.449999999999
numb you so you can then from that

8979.54 --> 8985.35
unjust regard that question that

8982.45 --> 8988.091
information as enemy to be ignored and

8985.35 --> 8991.301
your conscious will take it over and if

8988.091 --> 8996.061
you even stop hearing it when it's being

8991.301 --> 8996.061
said that's what really happens

8996.551 --> 9001.621
I'm not joking this is what happens when

8999.161 --> 9004.11
the signs are all over the place every

9001.621 --> 9006.270999999999
time we ask the questions just can you

9004.11 --> 9008.431
say it again okay say I didn't hear it

9006.271 --> 9010.471000000001
or they answer something else yes they

9008.431 --> 9012.331
just heard something else because they

9010.471 --> 9017.041
couldn't hear it because they got it

9012.331 --> 9019.621000000001
blocked because they know and they can

9017.041 --> 9021.721
deal with it so it just becomes blocked

9019.621 --> 9023.4
they can't hear it anymore it's the

9021.721 --> 9026.671
animal lab something that happens a lot

9023.4 --> 9030.841
on it it numbs everything atoms every

9026.671 --> 9032.491
emotion that's what you're saying I just

9030.841 --> 9035.251
explained exactly what I meant

9032.491 --> 9037.321
yes this what happens with me so and

9035.251 --> 9041.341
with many other people then then you can

9037.321 --> 9047.631
see people staring at their phone while

9041.341 --> 9047.631000000001
walking brain-dead and they are sown of

9074.331 --> 9085.681
War of the Worlds but just a

9076.561 --> 9087.451
housekeeping questions I bring this to a

9085.681 --> 9089.911
serious - a real real note over here

9087.451 --> 9092.641
because let's see let's see the first

9089.911 --> 9096.121
question any signs of curvature right

9092.641 --> 9098.311
let's see I want to ignore the optics

9096.121 --> 9100.500999999998
I wanna ignore the atmospheric

9098.311 --> 9102.061
conditions and the mirages and the

9100.501 --> 9104.69
mirroring and other thing and I say like

9102.061 --> 9106.891
[ __ ] I have caught a lot of obstruction

9104.69 --> 9108.571
differential with the with the hydride

9106.891 --> 9110.491
but I wanna ignore everything I said

9108.571 --> 9113.131
then that would be a sign of curvature

9110.491 --> 9115.501
okay I'll ask them that but am I gonna

9113.131 --> 9118.501
leave the flower because just because of

9115.501 --> 9120.721
it appears to be curvature just

9118.501 --> 9121.681
obstruction how about the answers to all

9120.721 --> 9123.779999999999
of the other house

9121.681 --> 9125.7
keeping questions this is the rally the

9123.78 --> 9127.831
ballers gotta take let's say sound he

9125.7 --> 9129.900000000001
say oh I cast this bendy bridge and I

9127.831 --> 9132.181
take it a secure but roadie like a [ __ ]

9129.9 --> 9133.98
oh man do you have an image but do you

9132.181 --> 9136.32
have answer but do you have answers to

9133.98 --> 9138.091
the other questions no not at all you

9136.32 --> 9139.770999999999
just accept that you just believe if you

9138.091 --> 9140.881000000001
know so this is they they own its

9139.771 --> 9142.381000000001
approach they gotta take they say you

9140.881 --> 9143.010999999999
know what I don't know there are holes

9142.381 --> 9144.9
there are gaps

9143.011 --> 9148.681
let's research this list you know let's

9144.9 --> 9151.100999999999
find the truth that's why she also they

9148.681 --> 9154.561
just they just argue every point

9151.101 --> 9163.921
headstrong other seeing the model work

9154.561 --> 9169.171
to remap the math works seeing ships

9163.921 --> 9171.69
disappearing behind horizon and then

9169.171 --> 9175.86
excluding the angle of attack thing

9171.69 --> 9179.371000000001
which I tested for myself is enough to

9175.86 --> 9181.621000000001
say the earth is spherical at some sort

9179.371 --> 9184.4
yeah but you have to ignore also

9181.621 --> 9187.109999999999
atmospheric conditions and a bunch of

9184.4 --> 9190.561
optic effect that do happen with the

9187.11 --> 9193.86
distance well the problem with

9190.561 --> 9195.931
atmospheric conditions is it would be it

9193.86 --> 9198.931
wouldn't just block the button it was

9195.931 --> 9201.15
blocked the whole ship yeah the dummy

9198.931 --> 9203.730000000001
rust layer and they and the circle

9201.15 --> 9205.350999999999
confusion happen very low in the bottom

9203.73 --> 9207.949999999999
section of the stuff in the distance yes

9205.351 --> 9211.650000000001
it does happen very low to the water in

9207.95 --> 9213.45
big bodies of water well but if you if

9211.65 --> 9215.609999999999
you see the whole ship disappear then

9213.45 --> 9219.391000000001
and then you try to zoom it back and it

9215.61 --> 9222.091
doesn't if you look at the ships have a

9219.391 --> 9224.931
really really bright light those fishing

9222.091 --> 9228.9
boats and the complete light disappears

9224.931 --> 9230.7
and you only can see that very top you

9228.9 --> 9232.801
can only see the reflection in the

9230.7 --> 9235.621000000001
atmosphere of the light I don't think

9232.801 --> 9237.180999999999
that the atmospheric conditions it is

9235.621 --> 9241.051
something blocking the light and it

9237.181 --> 9244.471000000001
isn't it isn't air it is water I'm sure

9241.051 --> 9246.510999999999
of it okay let's because the water is

9244.471 --> 9248.371
the flat surface you're looking over so

9246.511 --> 9250.711000000001
that that part of the flat surface

9248.371 --> 9253.381
you're looking at is I can not blocking

9250.711 --> 9254.688999999998
it yeah I don't I don't go with this

9253.381 --> 9261.698999999999
explanation anymore a test

9254.689 --> 9263.029
for you because now it works okay okay

9261.699 --> 9265.640000000001
hold on

9263.029 --> 9267.829
although it was a good let's say I we

9265.64 --> 9269.269999999999
can no I ignore because I really cannot

9267.829 --> 9270.619
understand very well the question but

9269.27 --> 9272.689
let's say you understand the world you

9270.619 --> 9274.970000000001
have seen this effect and you take it as

9272.689 --> 9276.649
curvature okay more power to you you

9274.97 --> 9278.538999999999
have seen the curvature but are you

9276.649 --> 9280.698999999999
gonna be gonna believe all the other

9278.539 --> 9282.970000000001
housekeeping questions where there's no

9280.699 --> 9286.249
proof no evidence no scientific you know

9282.97 --> 9288.38
citations do to support all your other

9286.249 --> 9293.63
beliefs you're just gonna take it for

9288.38 --> 9296.149
face value no because for example a

9293.63 --> 9302.319
magnetic car doesn't have anything to do

9296.149 --> 9302.319
with a flat or spherical earth right

9303.069 --> 9308.18
because what is that who are in a flat

9305.39 --> 9311.93
earth then it doesn't have a car exactly

9308.18 --> 9313.939
so it is relevant well it doesn't have

9311.93 --> 9316.939
anything to do with the surface of the

9313.939 --> 9319.579
earth distance what that's what quote

9316.939 --> 9320.93
unquote creates gravity in in in you

9319.579 --> 9323.06
know in it's for the position and

9320.93 --> 9327.26
gravity is what makes the shape of the

9323.06 --> 9330.47
earth round right so it's all connected

9327.26 --> 9335.39
that's the thing you're not seeing the

9330.47 --> 9343.67
magnetic car doesn't create the magnetic

9335.39 --> 9345.649
car of course the gravity a little bit I

9343.67 --> 9350.539
mean with the electromagnetic field we

9345.649 --> 9352.22
have around the earth and for for now it

9350.539 --> 9357.729000000001
is the best explanation I've ever heard

9352.22 --> 9359.989
for the electromagnetic you know reality

9357.729 --> 9361.97
potential but it's not reality because

9359.989 --> 9363.8
we physically haven't been there we just

9361.97 --> 9365.09
extrapolating because of the gases and

9363.8 --> 9367.13
all the analysis and all these

9365.09 --> 9369.17
earthquakes and all these volcanoes and

9367.13 --> 9371.3
[ __ ] but there's no truth to it it's a

9369.17 --> 9373.64
theory it's an explanation so he said

9371.3 --> 9376.729
just so story just like the freaking

9373.64 --> 9378.618999999999
Wizard of Oz or or Sancho Panza Don

9376.729 --> 9381.8
Quixote you know but it doesn't make the

9378.619 --> 9388.01
earth flat if it was you know I haven't

9381.8 --> 9390.8
said any wizards I mean either in a koi

9388.01 --> 9392.659
I have never seen a car either and I

9390.8 --> 9396.979
can't as I said I can prove it to you

9392.659 --> 9399.229
guys I I just can assume that it is

9396.979 --> 9403.038999999999
there but I have seen proof race and I

9399.229 --> 9405.38
admit it but is part of the model of day

9403.039 --> 9407.300000000001
of the spinning ball earth model so you

9405.38 --> 9409.399
must accept it I mean if you don't

9407.3 --> 9411.71
accept it then you are going against the

9409.399 --> 9415.278999999999
ball earth different there's your peers

9411.71 --> 9419.06
you know I don't have to accept

9415.279 --> 9421.220000000001
everything they tell me if I want if I

9419.06 --> 9424.868999999999
want to go with the earthís curved or

9421.22 --> 9429.108999999999
flat right I can try to understand it I

9424.869 --> 9431.09
can study it and I could try to prove it

9429.109 --> 9433.1
for myself or I can just ask my

9431.09 --> 9435.079
girlfriend if she can prove it for me

9433.1 --> 9436.550000000001
because she is a geologist but she

9435.079 --> 9438.288999999999
doesn't actually she doesn't do such

9436.55 --> 9440.538999999999
things usually she's not gonna dig down

9438.289 --> 9444.829000000002
you know 3,000 4,000 miles she's

9440.539 --> 9451.6
knowledgeable Bonnie's ass Arwen

9444.829 --> 9451.6
Bonnie's ass tube tinkerer that's very

9456.22 --> 9471.108999999999
oh I'm happy you know me you don't play

9465.829 --> 9473.21
that he doesn't difference - OH - any of

9471.109 --> 9475.130000000001
us he just gave it to do I don't know

9473.21 --> 9477.38
maybe because this is just a neutral

9475.13 --> 9477.858999999999
cool guy you know so we're not the cool

9477.38 --> 9479.71
guys

9477.859 --> 9487.789
he's sucking up to it that's what it is

9479.71 --> 9490.368999999999
yeah by the way congrats 866 subscribers

9487.789 --> 9497.869
now are we oh pretty awesome

9490.369 --> 9499.249
yeah we're getting you the oh we're

9497.869 --> 9499.699
getting you them I don't want to see you

9499.249 --> 9503.119
succeed

9499.699 --> 9504.409
yeah ever 65 people in chat come on if

9503.119 --> 9506.09
you don't subscribe just click that

9504.409 --> 9510.35
little subscribe button just there well

9506.09 --> 9514.01
I have actually given many of them are

9510.35 --> 9517.01
no subscribers also so andr Flat Earth

9514.01 --> 9517.661
debate trolls that just are desperate

9517.01 --> 9520.391
for

9517.661 --> 9522.551
come on if your guy guys have some

9520.391 --> 9524.951
content if you got content love your

9522.551 --> 9528.251
channel don't forget to subscribe to

9524.951 --> 9534.670999999998
Jose JG Gonzalez I will make it to 400

9528.251 --> 9542.381
soon 375 to caring be carribine in the

9534.671 --> 9543.881
chat each shade in the chest I'll

9542.381 --> 9546.100999999999
probably look into that next year you

9543.881 --> 9549.100999999999
know because it does interest me I have

9546.101 --> 9551.501
to be honest I think the map is some

9549.101 --> 9555.431
longevity with that or some truth in it

9551.501 --> 9559.381
well you know this Aristarchus I drop a

9555.431 --> 9563.171
so I'm a proving right

9559.381 --> 9565.751
many of Randy's observations within a

9563.171 --> 9568.961000000001
different part of the of the world all

9565.751 --> 9570.881
these mirroring effects and the haziness

9568.961 --> 9572.471
in the bottom all this good stuff the

9570.881 --> 9573.911
hope that happens in the distance with

9572.471 --> 9577.241
the bowls and the lands and the

9573.911 --> 9578.65
disappearing from the bottom up so many

9577.241 --> 9582.341
more people gotta go out there and

9578.65 --> 9584.371
record and and upload your your findings

9582.341 --> 9587.561
and your you know your observations

9584.371 --> 9590.801
because we have to we have to get to a

9587.561 --> 9593.65
conclusion to a solid explanation which

9590.801 --> 9596.110999999999
Randi hostage you know nail it in the

9593.65 --> 9599.471
head but we got to do a little more

9596.111 --> 9601.391000000001
observations yes Nick and just saying

9599.471 --> 9603.939999999999
just saying in the chat here that the

9601.391 --> 9605.501
Curie temperature isn't it related to

9603.94 --> 9607.181
the magnetic properties of the material

9605.501 --> 9611.261
exactly and we are to all we have a

9607.181 --> 9614.65
magnetic molten iron core so so how can

9611.261 --> 9616.711000000001
it be molten and magnetic if it's

9614.65 --> 9622.181
already past the Curie temperature Nick

9616.711 --> 9624.791
no Helen I think it is solid you say in

9622.181 --> 9628.331
the middle of partes molten do you very

9624.791 --> 9630.071
core the very center of the chorus it's

9628.331 --> 9632.501
good okay is power comes from the

9630.071 --> 9634.15
radioactive decay of isotopes in the

9632.501 --> 9636.371000000001
earth right okay so when did the last

9634.15 --> 9638.171
time somebody go down to the to the

9636.371 --> 9640.451
center of the earth check that out or

9638.171 --> 9646.9
sorry haven't we been down more than 10

9640.451 --> 9647.821
miles Nick well pseudoscience there you

9646.9 --> 9650.89
haven't got a clue

9647.821 --> 9655.0
do you have no idea you know

9650.89 --> 9659.409
Ruth whatsoever or to Minear yep that's

9655.0 --> 9662.47
one mile I got it he's been blocked on

9659.409 --> 9664.21
my channel for at least nobody nobody

9662.47 --> 9665.349999999999
being down there nobody being deep

9664.21 --> 9668.979
enough that's the answer

9665.35 --> 9673.720000000001
nobody has when when liquid materials

9668.979 --> 9679.569
solidify they get up they give some heat

9673.72 --> 9692.8
and radiation so it keeps the earth nice

9679.569 --> 9694.3
and warm for the winter someone from the

9692.8 --> 9697.899
other side of the flat fly you're right

9694.3 --> 9700.119999999999
you're right below the eight miles

9697.899 --> 9702.25
because it keeps getting hot and hot I

9700.12 --> 9704.17
thought what if they do break the layer

9702.25 --> 9706.149
of hot and it is really cold really cold

9704.17 --> 9707.949
and then after you break the cold lair

9706.149 --> 9711.25
it's really happy and then it's really

9707.949 --> 9713.050000000001
sad and there is it very very volatile I

9711.25 --> 9715.27
guess yes you don't know what the bodies

9713.05 --> 9717.64
down there are for you my I could enter

9715.27 --> 9720.0
giant cavern at some point so your place

9717.64 --> 9722.56
yeah you're basing it all on one hole

9720.0 --> 9727.27
you're basing it all on one small hole

9722.56 --> 9728.979
dug in one place on this big earth oh I

9727.27 --> 9730.479000000001
mean that's the furthest we got right

9728.979 --> 9735.76
yeah about the only physical evidence

9730.479 --> 9747.51
well in one place somebody else trying

9735.76 --> 9747.51
somewhere else that we're not aware of I

9754.17 --> 9760.359
don't even know if it ate but their

9757.33 --> 9762.159
story right we can watch the movie like

9760.359 --> 9764.050000000001
deep impact and just come to a

9762.159 --> 9767.17
conclusion you know but there's even a

9764.05 --> 9769.358999999999
more modern movie where they literally

9767.17 --> 9772.27
go through a drilling machine through

9769.359 --> 9776.069
the center of the earth and then crystal

9772.27 --> 9776.069000000001
caverns and then go through the laughs

9781.78 --> 9787.960000000001
fantasy isn't it the net fantasy the

9784.42 --> 9790.45
dream or we should like it's probably

9787.96 --> 9800.760999999999
dangerous but play like short snippets

9790.45 --> 9800.761
of that movie every time he asked I

9800.851 --> 9806.83
think even one of the first in design

9803.55 --> 9812.05
one of the first science fiction books

9806.83 --> 9821.38
were about journey into the earth yes

9812.05 --> 9824.05
like really really deepened the the

9821.38 --> 9826.391
inner realm and there is there's great

9824.05 --> 9830.71
there's a big chance it is there is some

9826.391 --> 9833.681
kind of subterranean realm the dinosaurs

9830.71 --> 9836.05
are down there oh yeah yeah of course

9833.681 --> 9839.261
everyone is down there Hey look I'm not

9836.05 --> 9841.689999999999
I'm not there might be a hollow hollow

9839.261 --> 9844.24
earth you know genuinely I'm not averse

9841.69 --> 9848.74
to that idea that there could be a realm

9844.24 --> 9851.98
in our beta a scepter rain legend around

9848.74 --> 9857.11
beneath ours who knows how big that is

9851.98 --> 9858.88
I would really like it I and then it

9857.11 --> 9861.431
there is a little Sun in the in the

9858.88 --> 9865.180999999999
middle of the earth like another no no

9861.431 --> 9867.79
no they don't know that is the spherical

9865.181 --> 9871.78
Hollow Earth concept they say there's a

9867.79 --> 9876.181
Sun inside but in the actual originals

9871.78 --> 9880.710000000001
it is obvious always a purple cloud

9876.181 --> 9880.710000000001
that'll be a solid holographic code

9883.92 --> 9890.53
there is no Sun disk there is actually a

9887.17 --> 9896.141
purple bigindoda video that acts like

9890.53 --> 9898.391000000001
the Sun does I just want to repeat what

9896.141 --> 9900.369999999999
Carol read in the chats you've just put

9898.391 --> 9905.38
where is your proof of this interior

9900.37 --> 9907.391000000001
nuclear reactor Nick because he did the

9905.38 --> 9911.089999999998
center of the earth is a nuclear reactor

9907.391 --> 9916.17
oh yeah right

9911.09 --> 9920.04
that one Carol mythically one yeah I

9916.17 --> 9921.960000000001
think I make so many most sold so many

9920.04 --> 9924.891000000001
just so stories you can make out of this

9921.96 --> 9928.169999999998
Center of the Earth theory in [ __ ]

9924.891 --> 9930.779999999999
incredible but we know we have I mean

9928.17 --> 9932.55
for saying about Nick I'm gonna have to

9930.78 --> 9934.230000000001
unblock them because nobody's seen this

9932.55 --> 9938.46
it's ridiculous

9934.23 --> 9941.641
I can see you I don't I feel making sure

9938.46 --> 9942.21
I don't I can see oh you like them right

9941.641 --> 9944.609999999999
yeah

9942.21 --> 9946.859999999999
can I see go yes that's why you don't

9944.61 --> 9948.54
see and I kind of see that people yeah

9946.86 --> 9952.710000000001
but people in the Hangout aren't gonna

9948.54 --> 9955.95
see it either it's like that in the

9952.71 --> 9960.689999999999
Hangout yeah it's not good right

9955.95 --> 9965.34
cats in the Hangout so anyway so let him

9960.69 --> 9967.380000000001
join yeah how do i unblock him

9965.34 --> 9969.54
oh wait a little gloss i know how to do

9967.38 --> 9971.939999999999
that Google went being will be careful

9969.54 --> 9974.431
asking how to be careful asking how to

9971.94 --> 9976.730000000001
use hangouts Randi my class no no no no

9974.431 --> 9980.61
I just said I remember how to do it I

9976.73 --> 9986.9
just have to go into the video manager

9980.61 --> 9989.880000000001
and then into the community settings I

9986.9 --> 9993.57
mean what would Nick like to join

9989.88 --> 9996.21
because I mean he'll we just say Riley

9993.57 --> 9999.15
this is the reason that he doesn't come

9996.21 --> 10002.869999999999
on into these box so you weren't welcome

9999.15 --> 10006.13
maybe he's forgetting Nick isn't a man

10002.87 --> 10009.62
Nick's short for Nick Hall

10006.13 --> 10012.23
I heard Riley was in that Riley was in

10009.62 --> 10014.150000000001
that speakers corner yesterday I see

10012.23 --> 10014.57
they he was live but I didn't see what

10014.15 --> 10018.641
went down

10014.57 --> 10021.529999999999
anybody seen what went down I was it

10018.641 --> 10023.99

10165.061 --> 10172.42
what's the question I'm sorry

10168.25 --> 10174.7
it's not about /f sorry you said it was

10172.42 --> 10176.431
morally right to have to pay tax because

10174.7 --> 10179.891000000001
some of it is used to pay for services

10176.431 --> 10183.67
is it morally right to take 50% of your

10179.891 --> 10188.529999999999
earnings in the first place if you're

10183.67 --> 10191.141
talking about morality depends what

10188.53 --> 10193.41
you're earning sir or 50% would seem a

10191.141 --> 10197.17
bit high is that what you guys caught

10193.41 --> 10201.511
that's what most of us pay I don't pay

10197.17 --> 10201.511
that much dicks well you can tax you pay

10202.74 --> 10213.851
think it's around 30 to 38 % what maae

10206.65 --> 10215.83
tax pardon property tax we have rights

10213.851 --> 10217.480000000001
they go to the local council we have too

10215.83 --> 10219.521
many levels of government I don't like

10217.48 --> 10225.100999999999
the way our governments structured last

10219.521 --> 10229.12
poverty tax petrol tax food tax your v80

10225.101 --> 10232.09
oh we got jst them all up you're paying

10229.12 --> 10235.36
at least 50% some of that I can climb

10232.09 --> 10238.48
back without my own business yes or any

10235.36 --> 10240.58
wait 38 percent income tax is it morally

10238.48 --> 10245.471
right to take 38 percent of what you

10240.58 --> 10247.601
earn without your consent but the thing

10245.471 --> 10248.561
is I live in this honest ID I have a

10247.601 --> 10251.74
greater consent

10248.561 --> 10254.471
you agreed to consent however greater

10251.74 --> 10260.17
the laws when you're born you know they

10254.471 --> 10262.24
come along now when you're born you

10260.17 --> 10264.971

10264.971 --> 10268.091
