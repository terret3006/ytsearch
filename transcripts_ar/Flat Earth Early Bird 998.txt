it's not super warm but it's not really

121.68 --> 125.36000000000001
cold either i feel i'll check the

123.68 --> 126.84
temperature

125.36 --> 129.44
after

126.84 --> 133.72
this all right

129.44 --> 133.72

143.2 --> 149.04

145.68 --> 153.12
first in chat good morning

149.04 --> 153.12
hello cleary good to see you

153.28 --> 160.2
it is tuesday the

155.599 --> 160.2
31st of august 2021

160.319 --> 164.56
it's last day

161.92 --> 164.55999999999997
of this month

165.04 --> 169.56
oh

165.92 --> 169.55999999999997
autumn is coming

171.92 --> 176.64
although yeah maybe

174.319 --> 177.67999999999998
maybe it'll be a nice september though

176.64 --> 179.27999999999997
because

177.68 --> 181.76000000000002
a lot of the times in the netherlands

179.28 --> 183.84
september's can be surprisingly mild

181.76 --> 185.51899999999998
like a bit of an after summer so we'll

183.84 --> 186.959
see what it'll what it's going to be

185.519 --> 189.44
like

186.959 --> 189.44
anyway

189.76 --> 194.56
right

191.76 --> 197.67999999999998
so yesterday was a

194.56 --> 199.84
it's an interesting day

197.68 --> 202.56
dutch sailor came over

199.84 --> 204.959
in the evening

202.56 --> 206.48
and yeah it was pretty it was pretty

204.959 --> 209.519
awesome

206.48 --> 213.39999999999998
it's been a while since i had somebody

209.519 --> 213.4
come by for a visit

220.159 --> 223.519
and yeah

221.519 --> 225.36
just had some catching up to isn't it it

223.519 --> 226.799
wasn't the first time we met up last

225.36 --> 229.04000000000002
time was like

226.799 --> 231.519
i'm not entirely sure i think like two

229.04 --> 232.79899999999998
years ago now

231.519 --> 234.959
and

232.799 --> 236.31900000000002
yeah it's just really good to catch up

234.959 --> 239.04
and to talk

236.319 --> 242.319
lots of talking

239.04 --> 242.319
spiritual experiences

242.48 --> 248.159
it was great

245.04 --> 249.76
i i was really happy you came by and

248.159 --> 252.72
yeah

249.76 --> 255.72
i went to coffee shop and [ __ ]

252.72 --> 255.72
so

256.32 --> 261.04
it was great although yeah i didn't

258.16 --> 263.91900000000004
really have any dinner

261.04 --> 266.24
i did manage to eat that cookie

263.919 --> 268.79999999999995
and i still had a banana lying around

266.24 --> 270.96000000000004
and that was pretty much my my food for

268.8 --> 274.08
the evening but i did catch up this

270.96 --> 276.32
morning by having unusually early

274.08 --> 277.84
breakfast

276.32 --> 280.8
so

277.84 --> 284.23999999999995
basically ate my lunch even before the

280.8 --> 284.24
show not rarely do that

285.44 --> 291.28
but i'm glad i did because i really did

288.32 --> 292.32
especially needed the fats

291.28 --> 294.08
anyway

292.32 --> 297.56
low return to normal

294.08 --> 297.56
good to see you

302.32 --> 306.639
chicken noodles that left

304.4 --> 310.0
right

306.639 --> 313.52
well i i i just chose to go to bed early

310.0 --> 315.6
for my doing like around two o'clock

313.52 --> 317.039
very happy i did i really needed the

315.6 --> 318.8
rest

317.039 --> 320.4
it's not over yet

318.8 --> 322.72
but it like

320.4 --> 325.84
it's weird like i need some type of

322.72 --> 325.84000000000003
special rest or something

326.16 --> 330.0
have been for for maybe a week

331.84 --> 338.32
so still just a lot of tension around

335.12 --> 339.6
yesterday i was like so tense

338.32 --> 341.68
and like

339.6 --> 343.91900000000004
lower half of my intestines like this

341.68 --> 346.24
weird tension and it's there's still a

343.919 --> 349.12
little there but

346.24 --> 353.32
it's man it's tenable also had a great

349.12 --> 353.32
call for my healer finally

354.72 --> 358.8
to basically try to straighten it out

356.56 --> 362.639
that helped

358.8 --> 362.639
that was yesterday afternoon

364.72 --> 371.199
and it was kind of funny because he even

367.6 --> 374.08000000000004
healer even gave me a compliment at it

371.199 --> 376.479
because yeah when detected

374.08 --> 377.68
yeah i don't know if it means much to

376.479 --> 380.15999999999997
anybody

377.68 --> 381.919
it's it's just feeling sizing up thing

380.16 --> 383.759
but he said like oh yeah you're only

381.919 --> 386.4
five percent of your buddy

383.759 --> 388.319
but that's really good because yeah he

386.4 --> 390.56
basically shared with me everybody he

388.319 --> 392.47900000000004
had checked

390.56 --> 395.36
in the last week or so

392.479 --> 397.12
was all zero and he was like wow you're

395.36 --> 399.44
like the first person

397.12 --> 401.44
in a while that is at least at five

399.44 --> 402.88
percent so

401.44 --> 404.16
yeah it's kind of weird to hear a

402.88 --> 406.71999999999997
compliment

404.16 --> 408.24
in that context

406.72 --> 410.0
but i was still doing pretty good

408.24 --> 412.16
despite everything

410.0 --> 415.52
apparently

412.16 --> 415.52000000000004
getting bombarded by

416.639 --> 421.759
all kinds of

419.199 --> 423.599
terrible suggestions and [ __ ] from all

421.759 --> 426.08000000000004
directions

423.599 --> 430.0
in media

426.08 --> 432.88
and even laid out some of that yesterday

430.0 --> 434.96
on the show it got pretty uh pretty

432.88 --> 437.12
riled up i watched the show back

434.96 --> 440.23999999999995
completely

437.12 --> 443.44
and again was totally surprised

440.24 --> 445.28000000000003
how much actually didn't came across

443.44 --> 447.919
which i'm glad about

445.28 --> 448.79999999999995
because sometimes when i'm like doing my

447.919 --> 451.19899999999996
show

448.8 --> 452.40000000000003
i have like in your experiences

451.199 --> 454.16
but

452.4 --> 456.08
my conscience has a lot of trouble

454.16 --> 458.639
distinguishing from what i think and

456.08 --> 460.8
what i actually express

458.639 --> 463.28000000000003
so it's almost like i auto assume like

460.8 --> 464.639
everything i think not just what i say

463.28 --> 466.4
comes through

464.639 --> 468.319
that's like how i remember it it's a

466.4 --> 470.15999999999997
weird little twist

468.319 --> 473.68
but then when i see it back it's like no

470.16 --> 475.91900000000004
wait it's not there

473.68 --> 476.84000000000003
it's odd

475.919 --> 479.44
but

476.84 --> 480.479
yeah it's it's all right yesterday was a

479.44 --> 483.12
good show

480.479 --> 483.12
overall

484.639 --> 488.24
seemed to have energy when i was on a

486.479 --> 491.24
visit yeah yeah dude but

488.24 --> 491.24
dude

493.84 --> 497.52
it's it was just good to have somebody

496.319 --> 499.599
on a visit

497.52 --> 501.75899999999996
and you had a good energy on you you're

499.599 --> 502.56
you're you had a lot of stability with

501.759 --> 504.639
you

502.56 --> 507.36
in contrast by the way to the previous

504.639 --> 509.84000000000003
time and you even on your own volition

507.36 --> 511.91900000000004
shared that fact with me

509.84 --> 515.279
you're just doing better and it was it

511.919 --> 516.88
was in ways kind of a relief to

515.279 --> 519.519
have somebody

516.88 --> 521.76
like you face to face to talk about

519.519 --> 524.0
all this stuff

521.76 --> 526.8
because it is different

524.0 --> 526.8
it's just more

527.36 --> 532.399
directness

529.12 --> 532.399
to it anyway

532.8 --> 535.8389999999999
good day yesterday

552.08 --> 556.48
you seem to have energy when it was yeah

554.16 --> 558.0
that's also by the way because i as i

556.48 --> 561.12
even said

558.0 --> 564.64
i just had my bears

561.12 --> 564.64
pretty much when you came by

564.959 --> 571.1199999999999
so i was all tanked up

568.56 --> 572.399
and i do get kind of energetic

571.12 --> 573.6
like that

572.399 --> 577.32
so

573.6 --> 577.32
it was all good fun

585.36 --> 587.6
right

588.08 --> 591.48
so anyway

592.24 --> 595.12
what is up

595.6 --> 600.64
because dutch sailor was over i did

598.48 --> 603.12
completely miss out on pretty much

600.64 --> 605.8389999999999
everything that was happening on youtube

603.12 --> 605.839
and such

605.92 --> 609.04
did notice that when i opened the

607.6 --> 613.32
browser up this morning it's like oh

609.04 --> 613.3199999999999
wait this this this

618.0 --> 622.079
did watch owen benjamin's last video

621.04 --> 624.48
though

622.079 --> 626.64
once you hear it you can't and hear it

624.48 --> 629.9590000000001
the notice of liability it's a pretty

626.64 --> 629.959
good show

632.959 --> 637.76
don't remember did i hang around at

634.8 --> 640.16
brandon's also in the chat for a bit

637.76 --> 640.16
could be

641.12 --> 647.36
uh

643.12 --> 651.0
yeah yeah i did it wouldn't show begin

647.36 --> 651.0
which is pretty late

660.16 --> 664.64
now brian's logic had a couple of

662.88 --> 667.8389999999999
short little streams

664.64 --> 667.8389999999999
or uploads

670.88 --> 674.68
did check that out

683.279 --> 686.279
right

696.72 --> 698.9590000000001
so

701.68 --> 705.519
what do you guys want to talk about

706.72 --> 711.64
we're 15 minutes into the show

719.2 --> 721.6800000000001
what the

726.0 --> 732.16
all right see you later dutch sailor

729.44 --> 732.1600000000001
that rhymes

738.639 --> 742.399
all right another note

740.48 --> 745.279
i did my uh

742.399 --> 748.959
my r song

745.279 --> 748.959
on the after show yesterday

750.639 --> 756.48
i don't know when that's gonna pop up in

752.32 --> 758.72
the premiere probably wednesday tomorrow

756.48 --> 760.0790000000001
but yeah i did great i did a great

758.72 --> 762.0
performance

760.079 --> 764.0
great before it's not that hard a song

762.0 --> 767.12
really

764.0 --> 767.12
but yeah that was fun

770.24 --> 774.639
it's it's a little bit of like an

772.24 --> 779.44
experiment so i really do wonder like

774.639 --> 779.44
what it'll do to you when you hear it

780.48 --> 786.0790000000001
uh

782.56 --> 789.04
so yeah that's it

786.079 --> 789.04
that's all i got

796.8 --> 801.12
latest ob

799.44 --> 803.36
yeah i returned to know they're they're

801.12 --> 805.04
all good

803.36 --> 807.6
he did give notice that he wasn't going

805.04 --> 811.5999999999999
to do a stream today though

807.6 --> 811.6
for some reason didn't say why

812.639 --> 815.839
too busy probably

829.279 --> 835.639
you can do it now if you want what do

831.76 --> 835.639
you mean return to normal

842.24 --> 845.839
the r song no no

850.079 --> 853.079
no

861.199 --> 865.4399999999999
no

862.639 --> 868.8
no sorry i'm i'm kind of like too

865.44 --> 868.8000000000001
still too tense for that

869.279 --> 874.8
like

870.88 --> 874.8
when i did that was like

875.36 --> 881.519
already after

877.12 --> 885.36
an hour being on fed and

881.519 --> 886.88
so i was just much more i felt much more

885.36 --> 888.8000000000001
smooth like i'm not going to do that

886.88 --> 892.959
right now i mean i technically could but

888.8 --> 895.199
it would be very forced and i i don't

892.959 --> 898.16
like because on an intuitive level i

895.199 --> 902.5999999999999
don't see the purpose

898.16 --> 902.6
so yeah i'm teasing a bit

906.84 --> 909.9290000000001
[Music]

913.519 --> 916.32
well

914.32 --> 917.9200000000001
you know i could just give you guys the

916.32 --> 922.12
lyrics

917.92 --> 922.12
as in why not

928.56 --> 932.6389999999999
and yeah the song is

930.48 --> 934.88
is quite a simple classic so you could

932.639 --> 936.88
basically even figure out from reading

934.88 --> 940.519
it what it's going to sound like

936.88 --> 940.519
so there you go

944.8 --> 948.3599999999999
it's that simple

955.279 --> 958.279
right

980.16 --> 983.56
i know right

997.44 --> 1003.6
yes i made that up

999.68 --> 1003.5999999999999
when was it i think on sunday

1004.72 --> 1010.72
i came up with that kind of like during

1008.079 --> 1012.88
the the first thought of it loomed like

1010.72 --> 1014.5600000000001
hey like

1012.88 --> 1016.72
a song

1014.56 --> 1018.8
like even during my own show when nathan

1016.72 --> 1020.32
was going at it with conspiracy cats in

1018.8 --> 1023.4399999999999
the chat

1020.32 --> 1026.4
and then later he was still doing

1023.44 --> 1030.0
things like that with like

1026.4 --> 1031.919
trolls or funny trolls in the fed

1030.0 --> 1034.799
premiere chat

1031.919 --> 1038.0
and then it really hit me like wait

1034.799 --> 1040.16
this is the row your boat song

1038.0 --> 1041.6
and it's so ironic because row row row

1040.16 --> 1043.8390000000002
your boat

1041.6 --> 1043.839
well

1046.0 --> 1051.039
the entire r

1048.079 --> 1054.72
starts with the mind experiment of

1051.039 --> 1057.12
believing that boats go over the curve

1054.72 --> 1059.2
when they disappear into the horizon

1057.12 --> 1062.76
so i thought that was like

1059.2 --> 1062.76
extra ironic

1071.44 --> 1078.799
right first live performed during the

1074.559 --> 1081.799
fed after show on monday afternoon

1078.799 --> 1081.799
woohoo

1095.28 --> 1100.6399999999999
yes they literally run away from r

1098.08 --> 1104.559
and if you take it literal

1100.64 --> 1104.5590000000002
right the horizon can't be far

1105.039 --> 1108.039
so

1117.2 --> 1120.0
yeah you could interpret it multiple

1118.88 --> 1121.8400000000001
ways

1120.0 --> 1123.84
they're gonna run away from the one

1121.84 --> 1126.32
asking about it

1123.84 --> 1129.12
but they also just want that horizon to

1126.32 --> 1131.2
be very close

1129.12 --> 1136.1999999999998
which would make them run

1131.2 --> 1136.2
towards it i guess or whatever anyway

1138.88 --> 1142.3200000000002
but it's funny because like the

1140.4 --> 1144.24
implication of running like it's not

1142.32 --> 1147.12
gonna help them because the horizon

1144.24 --> 1149.44
isn't geometric

1147.12 --> 1150.9599999999998
so if it's too far

1149.44 --> 1153.44
doesn't matter really what you do

1150.96 --> 1155.039
whether you go higher up or

1153.44 --> 1158.0
you move

1155.039 --> 1161.44
it's always going to be defying

1158.0 --> 1161.44
the spherical geometry

1162.4 --> 1167.919
right

1163.52 --> 1170.8799999999999
the horizon can't be far on the globe

1167.919 --> 1170.88
it can't be far

1171.6 --> 1176.48
black swan observations

1174.16 --> 1177.52
prove it's not a globe because it's too

1176.48 --> 1179.76
far

1177.52 --> 1181.679
you can see too far the horizon is too

1179.76 --> 1185.2
far

1181.679 --> 1185.2
for the spherical geometry

1189.36 --> 1194.32
right and it's funny because even like

1191.28 --> 1197.12
the merrily merrily even kind of fits

1194.32 --> 1201.6789999999999
because as they run wave run away from

1197.12 --> 1203.9189999999999
the r argument they do it all merrily

1201.679 --> 1203.919
right

1204.48 --> 1209.679
how many times when you've

1206.48 --> 1212.799
confronted a funny zealot in chat or in

1209.679 --> 1214.88
an actual verbal chat

1212.799 --> 1218.0
that they start to act like oh no i'm

1214.88 --> 1220.0
all good oh no it's i'm really happy

1218.0 --> 1223.039
it's so funny it's so funny when you say

1220.0 --> 1225.44
that remember that yeah merrily merrily

1223.039 --> 1226.799
merrily

1225.44 --> 1228.559
right

1226.799 --> 1230.96
it all fits

1228.559 --> 1232.6399999999999
like in so many ways it's crazy it's a

1230.96 --> 1235.039
total fractal

1232.64 --> 1238.5590000000002
explosion

1235.039 --> 1238.559
in such a basic song

1239.919 --> 1244.7990000000002
and even the original song

1242.88 --> 1248.679
row your boat had

1244.799 --> 1248.679
esoteric implications

1250.08 --> 1255.12
it's really just a take it easy and go

1253.36 --> 1258.9599999999998
along

1255.12 --> 1261.36
so like oh whatever don't worry just

1258.96 --> 1263.28
do yeah what you think you're supposed

1261.36 --> 1265.4399999999998
to be doing and everything will be all

1263.28 --> 1268.8799999999999
right which is

1265.44 --> 1270.559
kind of a dangerous yeah a double-edged

1268.88 --> 1272.159
sword

1270.559 --> 1274.1589999999999
in this age

1272.159 --> 1276.5590000000002
because you got to be very careful with

1274.159 --> 1278.0
just going along to get along could be

1276.559 --> 1279.52
deadly

1278.0 --> 1282.72
so yeah

1279.52 --> 1282.72
the whole thing

1283.12 --> 1286.8799999999999
life is but a dream

1285.12 --> 1289.8799999999999
i know that's part of it yeah and it

1286.88 --> 1289.88
isn't

1293.36 --> 1297.28
i mean some people

1295.36 --> 1299.12
for some people life is but a dream but

1297.28 --> 1300.8799999999999
that's because they get stuck in their

1299.12 --> 1302.9599999999998
dream

1300.88 --> 1305.7600000000002
and then yeah in the dream it's

1302.96 --> 1307.52
different as in the real life

1305.76 --> 1310.1589999999999
so and it

1307.52 --> 1312.72
there was already kind of a weird

1310.159 --> 1314.72
deceptive little detail in that song it

1312.72 --> 1316.84
was always

1314.72 --> 1321.2
a song where you had like

1316.84 --> 1321.1999999999998
hmm what do i think about this

1326.48 --> 1329.6
just get on with it

1331.6 --> 1336.36
hello one footer unit by the way

1373.2 --> 1378.72
man i'm getting so close to that

1375.44 --> 1378.72
thousandth episode

1378.96 --> 1383.039
i guess it's gonna happen this thursday

1384.88 --> 1389.24
hey hello jason brown

1396.94 --> 1400.009
[Music]

1411.52 --> 1415.799
hey hello aisles g

1424.159 --> 1427.3200000000002
all right

1440.88 --> 1445.5590000000002
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

1454.559 --> 1457.6
low formation

1456.64 --> 1460.88
blood

1457.6 --> 1460.8799999999999
you mean blood clothing

1460.96 --> 1464.08
clotting yeah yeah

1464.88 --> 1469.44
oh that

1466.559 --> 1472.72
dude like everything that is coming out

1469.44 --> 1475.8400000000001
of the v

1472.72 --> 1477.84
hey i i announced it announced it it's

1475.84 --> 1480.3999999999999
not like i made it

1477.84 --> 1482.559
but i already pretty much said publicly

1480.4 --> 1485.44
on my show like hello

1482.559 --> 1487.6789999999999
it's a wild experiment right this is not

1485.44 --> 1490.4
a controlled experiment this is like all

1487.679 --> 1492.24
kinds of new stuff

1490.4 --> 1494.72
untested

1492.24 --> 1496.96
thrown in there and that's so it's not

1494.72 --> 1500.64
surprising that it's like oh look at

1496.96 --> 1502.64
what this little element is

1500.64 --> 1505.6000000000001
and then there's like yeah studies

1502.64 --> 1508.159
because it's a wild experiment

1505.6 --> 1510.6399999999999
a lot of these things are never seen

1508.159 --> 1510.64
before

1511.12 --> 1514.6399999999999
so i'm not surprised that a lot of

1512.72 --> 1517.039
people get caught up in like whoa what

1514.64 --> 1517.039
is this

1520.48 --> 1524.44
in all kinds of directions

1529.52 --> 1533.6
wow agm that's just terrible

1535.52 --> 1540.84
i know you mean well

1538.159 --> 1543.7600000000002
and that look that is the

1540.84 --> 1545.76
mandela f that is the men that's how

1543.76 --> 1547.76
you're gonna remember it due to the

1545.76 --> 1550.799
mandela effect right when it's not

1547.76 --> 1550.799
actually like that

1551.6 --> 1556.24
because yeah that's what you're gonna

1553.6 --> 1559.4399999999998
think about

1556.24 --> 1561.76
the row your boat song oh wait the idea

1559.44 --> 1566.0800000000002
that boats are supposed to be going over

1561.76 --> 1566.08
the horizon to prove its earth curve

1567.679 --> 1570.88
right that's the association but that's

1569.52 --> 1573.44
not the song

1570.88 --> 1577.3600000000001
the song is about an intellectual

1573.44 --> 1579.1200000000001
argument and running away from that

1577.36 --> 1581.1999999999998
so it's about the discussion not

1579.12 --> 1585.76
actually about

1581.2 --> 1587.3600000000001
the original action of rowing a boat

1585.76 --> 1589.76
but it's funny how that all ties

1587.36 --> 1589.76
together

1597.84 --> 1602.799
yeah and my version rhymes

1601.2 --> 1606.32
very proud of that

1602.799 --> 1606.32
it wasn't that hard really

1608.24 --> 1613.279
you know there's a lot of things that

1610.159 --> 1613.279
rhyme with r

1616.4 --> 1622.76
but in this case far was exactly the

1619.2 --> 1622.76
word i needed

1645.76 --> 1648.76
what

1674.0 --> 1677.0
what

1685.12 --> 1689.84
all right okay okay i see it now

1690.559 --> 1693.76
truman show right

1695.52 --> 1699.039
should just

1696.96 --> 1700.799
use the word truman instead of jim

1699.039 --> 1702.96
carrey for that

1700.799 --> 1705.6
that'll shorten it up a bit right

1702.96 --> 1708.24
because the rhythm of the song is really

1705.6 --> 1710.1589999999999
important so you can't just cram extra

1708.24 --> 1712.72
words in there because you think they're

1710.159 --> 1715.5200000000002
really important for the information

1712.72 --> 1717.76
fluidity of the song is much more

1715.52 --> 1720.0
important because it is a canon

1717.76 --> 1722.8799999999999
the flu witness is gone then so is the

1720.0 --> 1722.88
canon function

1723.6 --> 1725.9189999999999
ah

1731.52 --> 1735.48
hey pj crew shack

1739.84 --> 1744.36
you're busted

1741.36 --> 1744.36
what

1756.0 --> 1759.0
so

1774.88 --> 1780.0
hey

1777.039 --> 1783.52
all right so good

1780.0 --> 1787.44
couple of people in chat now

1783.52 --> 1790.1589999999999
how do i see that again what is it

1787.44 --> 1793.2
participants right

1790.159 --> 1795.8400000000001
what cps is in here

1793.2 --> 1795.8400000000001
where

1799.12 --> 1802.8799999999999
okay

1799.919 --> 1802.88
oh there you go

1804.96 --> 1808.44
oh god

1809.12 --> 1811.6789999999999
see

1809.919 --> 1814.0800000000002
see that's what happens that's what

1811.679 --> 1816.0800000000002
happens when you all think like oh yeah

1814.08 --> 1818.0
let's make our own yeah the ballers are

1816.08 --> 1821.0
immediately gonna do that it was to be

1818.0 --> 1821.0
expected

1827.44 --> 1832.76
that's what you get when you take that

1829.76 --> 1832.76
liberty

1836.559 --> 1844.12
yeah i know cps it's humor but it's

1839.52 --> 1844.12
extremely predictable humor

1854.799 --> 1859.76
oh and by the way it's not an argument

1857.679 --> 1862.48
it's a chant if you're just gonna say

1859.76 --> 1864.8799999999999
the earth is a ball in the song that's

1862.48 --> 1869.6
just a chat right

1864.88 --> 1870.96
now my version the horizon can't be far

1869.6 --> 1875.84
is

1870.96 --> 1878.3990000000001
a fact about the globe model it's a fact

1875.84 --> 1881.6789999999999
it can't be far

1878.399 --> 1885.08
right that's not a chance that's a fact

1881.679 --> 1885.0800000000002
that's the difference

1925.039 --> 1930.0
what the hell are you talking about alsg

1928.08 --> 1933.36
no idea what you're saying oh hello by

1930.0 --> 1933.36
the way iron 26

1933.44 --> 1938.3200000000002
no not gonna do the young man from

1935.6 --> 1938.32
nantucket

1938.399 --> 1941.039
no thanks

1944.32 --> 1948.12
so in 80 12.

1978.96 --> 1984.2
yeah that wasn't what i was wondering pj

1980.96 --> 1984.2
creed shank

1990.96 --> 1994.44
what the hell

2006.559 --> 2010.559
what kind of lingo are you dabbling in

2009.44 --> 2013.6000000000001
dude

2010.559 --> 2013.6
that's just terrible

2014.32 --> 2018.4399999999998
ugh

2015.44 --> 2018.44
whatever

2020.399 --> 2026.5189999999998
you hate waking up thinking it's

2022.159 --> 2026.519
wednesday when it's tuesday okay

2044.88 --> 2050.679
yeah no

2046.48 --> 2050.679
no no no no

2080.72 --> 2084.56
is fluoride poisonous

2083.52 --> 2086.24
uh

2084.56 --> 2090.48
yeah

2086.24 --> 2094.1589999999997
if you never read like the label

2090.48 --> 2094.159
on fluoridated toothpaste

2095.04 --> 2099.839
and by the way sodium fluoride which is

2097.599 --> 2101.599
what they typically do put in toothpaste

2099.839 --> 2104.88
is not actually

2101.599 --> 2106.1600000000003
fluoride it's not like calcium fluoride

2104.88 --> 2108.7200000000003
which is

2106.16 --> 2111.2799999999997
actually kind of good

2108.72 --> 2112.9199999999996
for your bones and teeth

2111.28 --> 2116.0
now it's

2112.92 --> 2118.48
hydrofluorosilicic acid it's a chemical

2116.0 --> 2121.2
industry byproduct

2118.48 --> 2123.68
that was originally

2121.2 --> 2124.7999999999997
around quite a plenty was like junk

2123.68 --> 2127.04
material

2124.8 --> 2129.599
it was extremely poisonous and then they

2127.04 --> 2130.48
traditionally during the 19th century i

2129.599 --> 2134.4
think

2130.48 --> 2134.4
used it for rat poison

2135.68 --> 2140.64
people would have bags of it

2138.0 --> 2143.28
that they would use as rat poison but

2140.64 --> 2146.48
it's extremely toxic so it's very

2143.28 --> 2148.7200000000003
dangerous and it bioaccumulates so

2146.48 --> 2150.96
later that was banned

2148.72 --> 2154.52
it's good because it is like really

2150.96 --> 2154.52
hazardous waste

2158.48 --> 2162.56
dentists

2159.76 --> 2164.0
mind controlled well that's

2162.56 --> 2164.88
different

2164.0 --> 2167.119
look

2164.88 --> 2170.8
it's it's complicated with dentists i

2167.119 --> 2170.8
know my ex is one

2170.88 --> 2176.0
i taught her about sodium fluoride how

2173.04 --> 2178.56
it's wrong and she never used it since

2176.0 --> 2179.76
she didn't know about it she just got to

2178.56 --> 2182.48
be taught

2179.76 --> 2185.8390000000004
like yeah there are studies when you

2182.48 --> 2187.04
actually put this weird sodium fluoride

2185.839 --> 2188.24
like on your

2187.04 --> 2192.079
enamel

2188.24 --> 2194.72
of your teeth then it somehow hardens it

2192.079 --> 2196.48
but that's just like one very specific

2194.72 --> 2198.16
singular effect

2196.48 --> 2201.04
what those studies typically don't

2198.16 --> 2203.04
mention is that it gets absorbed through

2201.04 --> 2204.96
your gums and then enters your

2203.04 --> 2207.04
bloodstream and starts to burden your

2204.96 --> 2209.52
pineal gland

2207.04 --> 2212.64
and your kidneys

2209.52 --> 2212.64
very slowly

2213.68 --> 2219.2799999999997
right so technically yeah

2216.48 --> 2221.28
it is supposedly strengthening your

2219.28 --> 2223.52
enable but

2221.28 --> 2225.92
that's unfortunately not the only effect

2223.52 --> 2227.92
it's gonna have because when you brush

2225.92 --> 2230.0
your teeth you're to have it all over

2227.92 --> 2232.4
your mouth you're not just going to very

2230.0 --> 2234.8
carefully topically put it on the

2232.4 --> 2237.44
shields of your teeth and make sure it

2234.8 --> 2239.599
doesn't touch your gums etc right

2237.44 --> 2242.16
because if you want to properly apply

2239.599 --> 2243.839
that material that's the way you should

2242.16 --> 2246.0789999999997
be doing it

2243.839 --> 2248.72
but yeah nobody does that it's just

2246.079 --> 2251.04
toothpaste you just

2248.72 --> 2251.04
right

2252.4 --> 2255.64
it's complicated

2258.4 --> 2261.2000000000003
they are not in on the hoax that's right

2260.24 --> 2263.52
they

2261.2 --> 2265.839
no they aren't

2263.52 --> 2269.72
you have to teach them about it because

2265.839 --> 2269.72
they don't get taught

2271.28 --> 2275.3590000000004
about that

2273.2 --> 2277.7599999999998
they might find out on their own right

2275.359 --> 2279.7599999999998
they're a little bit into alternative

2277.76 --> 2281.6800000000003
medical things

2279.76 --> 2284.96
this very likely they'll find out and

2281.68 --> 2286.24
that's how they become like holistic

2284.96 --> 2287.52
oriented

2286.24 --> 2290.9199999999996
dentists

2287.52 --> 2290.92
like my ex

2303.68 --> 2308.24
but that's that was always terrible

2306.24 --> 2309.4399999999996
right a dentist

2308.24 --> 2311.5989999999997
is never

2309.44 --> 2313.68
if you can find a single dentist that

2311.599 --> 2317.3590000000004
will actually tell you that drinking

2313.68 --> 2319.68
fluoridated water is good for your teeth

2317.359 --> 2321.68
i want to know about that

2319.68 --> 2324.48
because i'm pretty sure they're not

2321.68 --> 2325.5989999999997
that's like oh that's

2324.48 --> 2329.52
like

2325.599 --> 2330.8
just they have no foundation for that

2329.52 --> 2333.52
to say that

2330.8 --> 2335.2000000000003
because the study did not tell that

2333.52 --> 2337.599
either unless that's like calcium

2335.2 --> 2340.8799999999997
fluoride right so they would have to

2337.599 --> 2343.04
fully understand that when fluoridated

2340.88 --> 2345.2000000000003
water is out there it's not calcium

2343.04 --> 2348.839
fluoride it's sodium fluoride it's a

2345.2 --> 2348.839
very different substance

2359.44 --> 2363.04
they only get taught to push for my

2361.44 --> 2366.56
product no

2363.04 --> 2366.56
no that's not true tony whitcomb

2366.64 --> 2372.8799999999997
they get a lot of incentives

2369.92 --> 2372.88
to help sell

2373.359 --> 2378.56
like dentistry products

2376.56 --> 2380.24
but that's

2378.56 --> 2383.2799999999997
it is like

2380.24 --> 2385.839
pharma related but there's just a lot of

2383.28 --> 2388.4
pretty decent developments in there it's

2385.839 --> 2390.96
it's complicated i got very up close

2388.4 --> 2392.88
right left with one

2390.96 --> 2395.119
she was really into that sort of thing

2392.88 --> 2397.52
like constantly studying up constantly

2395.119 --> 2400.8
like new procedures new materials all

2397.52 --> 2403.68
the new filling materials fascinating

2400.8 --> 2407.3590000000004
like new type she actually did a an

2403.68 --> 2409.7599999999998
actual official study for her

2407.359 --> 2411.5989999999997
well for exam

2409.76 --> 2412.8
dentist exam

2411.599 --> 2416.4
like this

2412.8 --> 2418.48
paper about the different

2416.4 --> 2420.56
like filler materials

2418.48 --> 2422.8
and what they were like and said it was

2420.56 --> 2424.72
it was interesting it was actually

2422.8 --> 2428.4
interesting

2424.72 --> 2428.3999999999996
i learned a couple of things from that

2430.48 --> 2434.64
all right so they're not like

2435.119 --> 2438.4
like

2436.88 --> 2440.7200000000003
drunk pushers

2438.4 --> 2443.2000000000003
dentists are not like drug pushers like

2440.72 --> 2444.8799999999997
that they don't that's just not what

2443.2 --> 2448.5989999999997
they do

2444.88 --> 2448.599
it's not in their interest

2456.48 --> 2463.72
you've got to get your

2458.64 --> 2463.72
filter all right yeah filters are great

2471.28 --> 2475.5600000000004
americans acting fluoridated

2480.64 --> 2485.2799999999997
i usually tell the dentist to put the

2483.359 --> 2488.16
dose

2485.28 --> 2488.1600000000003
in their own mouth

2489.92 --> 2497.839
oh you mean the fluoride treatment right

2493.28 --> 2497.8390000000004
the goo with well that's the thing

2498.24 --> 2503.68
right you have like i will still

2500.24 --> 2505.04
remember like the little the the teeth

2503.68 --> 2507.2799999999997
uh

2505.04 --> 2509.68
mold thing and then you have like the

2507.28 --> 2511.8390000000004
the gel in it and it's fluorated

2509.68 --> 2514.48
fluoridated gel but it's like gel not

2511.839 --> 2517.52
liquid and then you put that over your

2514.48 --> 2518.8
teeth well that is actually supposed to

2517.52 --> 2521.359
harden

2518.8 --> 2523.8390000000004
the enamel and it is not

2521.359 --> 2525.52
necessarily bad it becomes bad when you

2523.839 --> 2527.599
start to suck on it and then like oh

2525.52 --> 2528.8
this this night yeah then you're getting

2527.599 --> 2532.1600000000003
it

2528.8 --> 2534.8
absorbed by your gums right

2532.16 --> 2537.839
so it's tricky

2534.8 --> 2537.8390000000004
i don't like

2538.319 --> 2543.599
i wouldn't be like nasty to a dentist

2541.2 --> 2545.68
over it

2543.599 --> 2548.079
like if you don't want to put those

2545.68 --> 2550.16
floor right

2548.079 --> 2552.4
things over your teeth to harden your

2550.16 --> 2554.8799999999997
enamel if you're if you're afraid of it

2552.4 --> 2556.7200000000003
or whatever then that's perfectly fine

2554.88 --> 2558.319
to refuse that

2556.72 --> 2560.0
but you shouldn't give the dentist a

2558.319 --> 2561.68
hard time over it although yeah you

2560.0 --> 2563.68
could add did you know about sodium

2561.68 --> 2564.44
flour it's actually bad it gets absorbed

2563.68 --> 2567.9199999999996
it's

2564.44 --> 2567.92
bioaccumulative poison

2568.4 --> 2571.6800000000003
let's see if they know about it or not

2570.56 --> 2574.4
right

2571.68 --> 2576.3999999999996
you'll be surprised dentists know a lot

2574.4 --> 2578.4
about their craft

2576.4 --> 2580.0
a lot they have to know

2578.4 --> 2582.0
that doesn't automatic but they're

2580.0 --> 2582.8
specialists that doesn't mean they're

2582.0 --> 2586.079
like

2582.8 --> 2587.28
they know all these other things

2586.079 --> 2589.119
that we've

2587.28 --> 2590.3190000000004
like typical

2589.119 --> 2592.96
layman

2590.319 --> 2595.68
people and alternative medical people

2592.96 --> 2597.44
get to learn they don't automatically

2595.68 --> 2599.52
get in contact with the often they don't

2597.44 --> 2602.079
even have the time

2599.52 --> 2603.7599999999998
to consider that because the study is so

2602.079 --> 2606.76
heavy

2603.76 --> 2606.76
right

2610.319 --> 2615.92
but yeah anybody should be able to just

2613.28 --> 2619.8
refuse it but don't give your dentist a

2615.92 --> 2619.8
hard time over it

2626.4 --> 2629.599
besides you don't really want to give

2627.92 --> 2631.52
your dentist a hard time they're

2629.599 --> 2632.96
actually like

2631.52 --> 2635.2
it's just like yeah you don't want to

2632.96 --> 2638.319
piss off your surgeon if you know what i

2635.2 --> 2638.319
mean this is

2639.04 --> 2642.64
because that's basically what they are a

2640.8 --> 2645.6400000000003
lot of the times

2642.64 --> 2645.64
right

2649.76 --> 2652.7200000000003
they never want to take it them yeah of

2651.359 --> 2654.88
course they don't

2652.72 --> 2656.3999999999996
why would they

2654.88 --> 2660.1600000000003
but

2656.4 --> 2661.76
a lot of dentists probably have taken

2660.16 --> 2664.56
the fluoride

2661.76 --> 2666.8
lacing to harden their enamel at some

2664.56 --> 2667.599
point probably even during their studies

2666.8 --> 2669.599
right

2667.599 --> 2671.3590000000004
it pretty much guaranteed that all of

2669.599 --> 2673.52
them have done it but then they learn

2671.359 --> 2676.56
like yeah you don't need to freaking do

2673.52 --> 2678.72
that like every half year or something

2676.56 --> 2682.0
you know at some point it's just like no

2678.72 --> 2682.0
you've had that enough

2683.04 --> 2686.96
like

2684.72 --> 2686.9599999999996
yeah

2687.28 --> 2693.44
so they they don't it's just like

2690.319 --> 2695.44
comparable to x-rays right

2693.44 --> 2697.68
people that work with x-ray machines

2695.44 --> 2699.92
they know like yeah that's

2697.68 --> 2702.24
if you continue to expose yourself to

2699.92 --> 2704.8
that's bad

2702.24 --> 2707.52
doesn't mean it's not a a good piece and

2704.8 --> 2710.48
a reliable piece of equipment right well

2707.52 --> 2712.96
that's how doctors probably or i mean

2710.48 --> 2715.28
how dentists probably see like fluoride

2712.96 --> 2715.28
a lot

2716.319 --> 2719.72
i'm not sure

2721.599 --> 2726.88
but yeah to have it in drinking water is

2724.56 --> 2729.599
absolutely preposterous and

2726.88 --> 2731.28
counterproductive

2729.599 --> 2733.599
because when you drink it

2731.28 --> 2736.6400000000003
it actually contributes to a condition

2733.599 --> 2740.8
known as fluorosis this is

2736.64 --> 2743.359
yeah the fluoride it fluorosis

2740.8 --> 2745.6800000000003
which is actually very bad for your

2743.359 --> 2747.52
teeth development and even your bones

2745.68 --> 2749.52
and all kinds of things

2747.52 --> 2751.04
especially when you're young and still

2749.52 --> 2753.599
in in growth

2751.04 --> 2755.04
it's terrible drinking fluoridated water

2753.599 --> 2759.0
terrible

2755.04 --> 2759.0
avoid it at all costs

2771.599 --> 2777.599
no no it doesn't work that way lg

2774.96 --> 2780.96
the effectiveness of fluorite through

2777.599 --> 2784.88
dentistry is never by drinking it never

2780.96 --> 2784.88
ever that's they know that

2785.2 --> 2790.3999999999996
it's just having it against your enamel

2789.599 --> 2792.319
was

2790.4 --> 2795.44
i guess scientifically studied and

2792.319 --> 2797.52
proven to harden the enamel

2795.44 --> 2800.56
to make it less brittle

2797.52 --> 2803.359
that's it that is the only

2800.56 --> 2804.48
purpose for application of it the only

2803.359 --> 2807.2
thing they

2804.48 --> 2809.2
won't tell you drink that

2807.2 --> 2812.64
ever dentists will never tell you to

2809.2 --> 2812.64
drink fluoridated water

2813.44 --> 2817.839
because that's not what it's supposed to

2815.44 --> 2817.839
be for

2819.52 --> 2823.92
if you'd ask them they tell you well you

2821.839 --> 2828.24
could probably take calcium fluoride

2823.92 --> 2828.2400000000002
that's not the same as sodium fluoride

2829.28 --> 2835.2000000000003
i think i i don't know i haven't really

2833.04 --> 2839.0
checked tested out a whole bunch of

2835.2 --> 2839.0
dentists with this

2846.96 --> 2849.28
what

2855.44 --> 2859.8
the hell carson what are you doing

2865.76 --> 2873.079
your country has the best water in the

2868.319 --> 2873.079
world what what country is that

2903.2 --> 2906.2
hello

2916.72 --> 2922.4399999999996
i'm trying to have a discussion here you

2918.72 --> 2922.4399999999996
guys brought it up

2929.68 --> 2933.5989999999997
yeah whatever anyway

2931.68 --> 2934.96
yeah

2933.599 --> 2938.319
don't

2934.96 --> 2941.2
consume or drink

2938.319 --> 2942.96
sodium fluoride calcium fluoride is

2941.2 --> 2944.48
pretty good but every time you see

2942.96 --> 2947.76
fluoride

2944.48 --> 2949.92
only in water or everything

2947.76 --> 2951.599
it's going to be sodium fluoride in most

2949.92 --> 2953.52
cases

2951.599 --> 2956.7200000000003
right

2953.52 --> 2960.559
unless it's specifically exclusively

2956.72 --> 2963.2799999999997
says on ingredients or whatever

2960.559 --> 2965.599
calcium fluoride

2963.28 --> 2968.7200000000003
be careful it it doesn't say calcium

2965.599 --> 2971.44
fluoride and sodium fluoride because

2968.72 --> 2972.319
then you're still going to be [ __ ]

2971.44 --> 2974.64
right

2972.319 --> 2977.44
but it's more likely you'll you'll not

2974.64 --> 2980.319
find calcium fluoride being

2977.44 --> 2982.16
like put into stuff

2980.319 --> 2984.5589999999997
you'll probably just find it as like

2982.16 --> 2986.48
separate tablets that you can chew on

2984.559 --> 2989.3590000000004
and take like that

2986.48 --> 2992.0
i've seen those calcium fluoride tablets

2989.359 --> 2992.0
for eating

2996.319 --> 2999.599
scotland

2997.52 --> 3000.8
so scotland has the cleanest water in

2999.599 --> 3004.559
the world

3000.8 --> 3007.6800000000003
if you say so i actually heard a rumor

3004.559 --> 3010.6400000000003
mind you so don't pin me down on this

3007.68 --> 3013.04
that some parts of scotland did actually

3010.64 --> 3017.04
fluoridate their water

3013.04 --> 3018.319
but that might have just been a rumor

3017.04 --> 3022.92
so

3018.319 --> 3022.92
are you sure about that aries

3028.88 --> 3033.2000000000003
you do realize that practically

3033.599 --> 3037.52
england

3034.8 --> 3042.0
and i'm talking about old old england

3037.52 --> 3043.52
practically invented fluoridating water

3042.0 --> 3047.2
to make

3043.52 --> 3049.7599999999998
populations more docile

3047.2 --> 3054.9199999999996
they're the ones to start applying it

3049.76 --> 3054.92
systematically during imperial days

3060.48 --> 3064.4
so are you sure aries

3066.96 --> 3072.319
and that was from the dwqr i don't know

3069.76 --> 3072.3190000000004
what that is

3080.839 --> 3086.4
chemtrails no cbs chemtrails

3085.119 --> 3088.88
no

3086.4 --> 3091.44
it's not chemtrails it's just weather

3088.88 --> 3094.0
modification it is geoengineering and

3091.44 --> 3097.119
this is publicly admitted

3094.0 --> 3100.079
chemtrails is an old

3097.119 --> 3102.079
an old nomer for the phenomenon when it

3100.079 --> 3105.28
was first discovered like hey why are

3102.079 --> 3106.6400000000003
planes leaving these unnatural

3105.28 --> 3108.8390000000004
trails

3106.64 --> 3110.48
that the persistent

3108.839 --> 3113.68
trails

3110.48 --> 3115.76
and contrails condensation trails don't

3113.68 --> 3118.3999999999996
do that ever

3115.76 --> 3121.2000000000003
they don't haze out like a dust cloud

3118.4 --> 3123.119
right and then originally that was hyped

3121.2 --> 3125.839
up and it was like chemtrails and maybe

3123.119 --> 3128.4
some region did have actual chemicals

3125.839 --> 3129.68
being trailed like that really

3128.4 --> 3132.0
nasty

3129.68 --> 3133.68
but that was never worldwide that was

3132.0 --> 3134.839
only local

3133.68 --> 3136.48
but yeah

3134.839 --> 3138.48
geoengineering

3136.48 --> 3140.319
which is what it is called

3138.48 --> 3142.96
modern days

3140.319 --> 3147.24
by informed people is officially

3142.96 --> 3147.2400000000002
admitted and that's what it is

3152.96 --> 3159.2
and fluoride conspiracy dude that's been

3155.52 --> 3161.2
around for a long long time

3159.2 --> 3165.72
a long time

3161.2 --> 3165.72
known for a long time

3186.8 --> 3192.6400000000003
the scottish regulator claims the

3189.2 --> 3192.64
scottish water is the best

3199.599 --> 3201.839
oh

3202.319 --> 3206.2
he would wouldn't he

3217.839 --> 3222.92
scotland's not even on the list huh

3230.079 --> 3235.76
well what i know is that the netherlands

3233.44 --> 3238.079
like we have a separate

3235.76 --> 3239.92
organ of government

3238.079 --> 3243.119
for the water

3239.92 --> 3246.48
seriously we have a separated

3243.119 --> 3247.6800000000003
like governmental organ for water

3246.48 --> 3251.119
maintenance

3247.68 --> 3254.72
and that means like dike building rivers

3251.119 --> 3257.839
but also like the water quality

3254.72 --> 3260.72
in the soil and the rivers right

3257.839 --> 3263.599
i bet that the netherlands is on that

3260.72 --> 3265.52
list of highest water qualities too not

3263.599 --> 3268.6400000000003
saying we're at the top but we're

3265.52 --> 3268.64
definitely in there

3268.72 --> 3272.8799999999997
you should be

3271.359 --> 3274.7999999999997
and like

3272.88 --> 3277.04
yeah nature's doing just fine there's

3274.8 --> 3280.4
plenty of places where there's frogs

3277.04 --> 3280.4
right because that's how you know

3281.52 --> 3285.599
frogs

3283.2 --> 3287.9199999999996
in water regions means

3285.599 --> 3289.599
clean water

3287.92 --> 3291.6800000000003
that's how you know

3289.599 --> 3294.1600000000003
no frogs anywhere

3291.68 --> 3296.319
that's suspicious

3294.16 --> 3297.359
because frogs are hypersensitive to

3296.319 --> 3302.599
poison

3297.359 --> 3302.5989999999997
to bio accumulating poison

3318.16 --> 3323.5989999999997
wow aries uh

3321.2 --> 3323.5989999999997
dude

3325.04 --> 3329.079
don't be so triggered man

3339.2 --> 3343.4399999999996
like he's not he was just making a

3341.28 --> 3344.96
freaking joke and a jungle joke that had

3343.44 --> 3347.04
a pretty good point

3344.96 --> 3349.28
right

3347.04 --> 3350.88
i mean i told you about a piece of

3349.28 --> 3353.28
history

3350.88 --> 3355.04
you didn't really respond to that he

3353.28 --> 3357.8390000000004
made a joke about

3355.04 --> 3359.359
your statement don't be so triggered

3357.839 --> 3362.0789999999997
look

3359.359 --> 3363.5989999999997
if it really is the best water or one of

3362.079 --> 3366.6400000000003
the best waters out there then you

3363.599 --> 3367.599
shouldn't be having a problem

3366.64 --> 3371.24
right

3367.599 --> 3371.2400000000002
don't be so triggered

3384.64 --> 3390.359
and yeah return to normal is not after

3387.359 --> 3390.359
you

3403.2 --> 3409.96
england is not scotland oh yeah yeah but

3406.16 --> 3409.96
it kind of is

3423.52 --> 3429.28
what dude return to normal

3426.64 --> 3429.2799999999997
what the hell

3430.96 --> 3437.359
stop now you got to stop it

3433.2 --> 3437.359
i'm gonna give you above the boot

3437.839 --> 3442.64
my chat is not for just a bunch of

3440.079 --> 3442.6400000000003
brawling

3443.359 --> 3446.5989999999997
all right

3456.96 --> 3460.7200000000003
yeah

3458.559 --> 3463.0400000000004
england is florida is it floor is

3460.72 --> 3465.839
england florida i don't know is

3463.04 --> 3467.839
england's water fluoridated

3465.839 --> 3470.16
that seems quite a statement out of

3467.839 --> 3472.48
nowhere i didn't even say england has

3470.16 --> 3475.2799999999997
its water florida i just said like

3472.48 --> 3478.16
water fluoridation was practically

3475.28 --> 3480.4
invented by the british

3478.16 --> 3482.319
during the imperial days that's what i

3480.4 --> 3484.7200000000003
said i don't even know if they have

3482.319 --> 3486.96
their water fluoridated currently

3484.72 --> 3489.04
i would not be super surprised if they

3486.96 --> 3492.079
did i would be

3489.04 --> 3493.599
very displeased by it

3492.079 --> 3495.3590000000004
the problem though is with water

3493.599 --> 3497.92
fluoridation is

3495.359 --> 3501.52
once you have fluoridated water it sinks

3497.92 --> 3504.2400000000002
into the ground it doesn't get out

3501.52 --> 3504.24
you understand

3504.799 --> 3508.559
it poisons the well

3510.079 --> 3516.88
unless you have a lot of groundwater

3514.24 --> 3518.72
running not sitting still running

3516.88 --> 3520.319
through your country like if it is a

3518.72 --> 3522.48
river mount country like the netherlands

3520.319 --> 3525.2
we're kind of lucky like that

3522.48 --> 3527.44
then poison can eventually kind of flush

3525.2 --> 3527.4399999999996
out

3529.68 --> 3534.3999999999996
if you don't have that then if at some

3532.64 --> 3536.1189999999997
point in history

3534.4 --> 3538.4
the place was poisoned with

3536.119 --> 3540.2400000000002
bio-accumulating poison like fluoride

3538.4 --> 3542.7200000000003
sodium fluoride

3540.24 --> 3545.2799999999997
that's kind of going to stay

3542.72 --> 3547.4399999999996
that's the problem right

3545.28 --> 3550.7200000000003
i'm just telling you

3547.44 --> 3553.04
fluoride doesn't just dissolve

3550.72 --> 3556.839
it stays that's the problem that's why

3553.04 --> 3556.839
it's really poisonous

3561.599 --> 3567.4
it yeah it doesn't break down by natural

3564.4 --> 3567.4
means

3574.4 --> 3579.559
hello nathan oakley by the way good to

3576.4 --> 3579.559
see you

3602.559 --> 3609.2000000000003
oh that's a good one classical homeopath

3606.559 --> 3612.559
uk is extremely cocked

3609.2 --> 3615.2799999999997
but at least it gave us nathan oakley

3612.559 --> 3618.28
and we are great grateful for that

3615.28 --> 3618.28
yeah

3635.52 --> 3641.2
right now ben white correct but you

3637.92 --> 3644.96
should spell it out it's sodium fluoride

3641.2 --> 3647.52
which is even a catch catch-all phrase

3644.96 --> 3649.92
for one of the most predominant elements

3647.52 --> 3651.359
would be hydrofluorosilicic

3649.92 --> 3655.2000000000003
acid

3651.359 --> 3657.2799999999997
and that is ex it's not just toxic

3655.2 --> 3660.8799999999997
it is a

3657.28 --> 3665.3590000000004
hazardous waste material and it is not

3660.88 --> 3665.359
just toxic it's extremely poisonous

3666.4 --> 3671.7200000000003
in concentrated form is absolutely

3668.72 --> 3671.72
lethal

3673.839 --> 3681.48
and one of the more nasty aspects of the

3676.4 --> 3681.48
material is is that it bio accumulates

3682.799 --> 3688.16
which is by the way also a property of

3685.68 --> 3688.16
let's say

3689.68 --> 3695.839
what's it called again

3691.76 --> 3699.2400000000002
that disgusting poison roundup

3695.839 --> 3699.24
what's it called

3701.92 --> 3706.2400000000002
i don't remember the exact toxin name

3703.68 --> 3708.72
but that stuff also bio accumulates it's

3706.24 --> 3708.72
terrible

3708.88 --> 3714.4
like

3710.079 --> 3714.4
it doesn't just flush out easily

3715.2 --> 3722.5589999999997
starts see yeah just getting into things

3719.2 --> 3725.0389999999998
and then refuses to come out

3722.559 --> 3727.8390000000004
glyphosate that's the one yeah

3725.039 --> 3729.559
right glyphosate

3727.839 --> 3732.24
is

3729.559 --> 3733.52
bioaccumulating type of poison as well

3732.24 --> 3735.4399999999996
but it is different though because

3733.52 --> 3738.0
glyphosate typically do

3735.44 --> 3741.2000000000003
is dissolvable in fats

3738.0 --> 3743.68
fluoride not is not it's it's

3741.2 --> 3746.319
water dissolvable but it yeah it

3743.68 --> 3747.839
basically starts merging

3746.319 --> 3751.359
with

3747.839 --> 3752.839
yeah substances like calcium related

3751.359 --> 3757.24
things bones and

3752.839 --> 3757.24
[ __ ] terrible stuff

3772.72 --> 3777.2799999999997
what fluoride percentage is put it i

3775.599 --> 3780.0
don't know

3777.28 --> 3783.52
but the thing is it by bloom it bio

3780.0 --> 3784.319
accumulates that means

3783.52 --> 3787.52
yeah

3784.319 --> 3790.24
if you take the full amount one it

3787.52 --> 3792.24
instantly yeah you die right let's just

3790.24 --> 3794.799
say you take a leave for those but if

3792.24 --> 3797.2799999999997
you then spread it out

3794.799 --> 3800.0
over a year and take

3797.28 --> 3801.2000000000003
micro dosages like in water and take

3800.0 --> 3803.2
that

3801.2 --> 3804.799
you're still gonna have quite you're

3803.2 --> 3806.319
still gonna

3804.799 --> 3808.96
grow

3806.319 --> 3811.599
in the the amount of poison it literally

3808.96 --> 3814.079
builds up in your body

3811.599 --> 3816.48
and then at the end theoretically you

3814.079 --> 3818.7200000000003
could still die unless you have managed

3816.48 --> 3819.92
to flush it out

3818.72 --> 3824.0389999999998
actively

3819.92 --> 3824.039
out of your system simultaneously

3825.2 --> 3827.4399999999996
right

3831.039 --> 3834.039
what

3856.88 --> 3859.88
yep

3867.039 --> 3871.5200000000004
the wood is like yeah bad car but that's

3868.96 --> 3872.88
because it's i think it's a singular

3871.52 --> 3875.0389999999998
person

3872.88 --> 3876.319
you know when the show started out

3875.039 --> 3878.7200000000003
it had like

3876.319 --> 3881.0389999999998
is it six up votes

3878.72 --> 3883.0389999999998
no down votes and then suddenly out of

3881.039 --> 3884.96
nowhere

3883.039 --> 3887.8390000000004
it's one person

3884.96 --> 3887.839
there's one person

3888.88 --> 3894.48
and they just

3890.88 --> 3896.7200000000003
stack up the down votes immediately that

3894.48 --> 3901.16
didn't slowly build up it was just

3896.72 --> 3901.16
immediately poured in there

3929.28 --> 3933.039
distiller well that's one way of doing

3931.44 --> 3935.039
it

3933.039 --> 3938.6400000000003
i prefer

3935.039 --> 3941.039
like ceramic filters

3938.64 --> 3943.2
just a big water tank

3941.039 --> 3946.2400000000002
ceramic filters you pour

3943.2 --> 3948.0789999999997
like tap water in there you let it seep

3946.24 --> 3950.9599999999996
through

3948.079 --> 3953.8390000000004
and then you have like yeah

3950.96 --> 3953.839
a gallon of

3954.16 --> 3960.96
very fresh tasty healthy water

3958.319 --> 3961.839
and like the plants my plants love that

3960.96 --> 3965.359
water

3961.839 --> 3968.0
it's a big difference

3965.359 --> 3968.0
like all the

3968.16 --> 3972.16
since i use that water on my plants they

3971.2 --> 3974.96
like

3972.16 --> 3979.16
survive the winter and [ __ ]

3974.96 --> 3979.16
even though they're just herb plants

3998.16 --> 4003.2799999999997
reverse osmosis no that's not what i'm

4000.64 --> 4003.2799999999997
referring to

4004.88 --> 4008.96
no just a big

4006.48 --> 4008.96
filter

4009.119 --> 4015.1600000000003
through which the water has to pass into

4011.76 --> 4015.1600000000003
another tank

4020.48 --> 4024.559
that's right i got a berkey system

4027.839 --> 4031.2
man i've had it since

4031.599 --> 4034.599
2008

4037.68 --> 4043.2799999999997
very happy with it like it

4040.24 --> 4043.2799999999997
it helped a lot

4044.24 --> 4048.5589999999997
it gave me like a

4046.0 --> 4050.4
crystal level clarity that before that i

4048.559 --> 4054.079
just couldn't grip it

4050.4 --> 4054.079
i would always be distracted

4054.48 --> 4059.2
but it's kind of difficult to tell

4056.0 --> 4061.119
exactly what did all that because that's

4059.2 --> 4063.52
also the same transition phase where

4061.119 --> 4066.559
they stopped eating non-organic food and

4063.52 --> 4068.88
especially dropped like non-organic

4066.559 --> 4071.44
candy and [ __ ] and chips

4068.88 --> 4073.359
so i dropped a lot of chemicals

4071.44 --> 4077.68
that are not healthy

4073.359 --> 4080.24
that also did a lot to improve my system

4077.68 --> 4083.5589999999997
so much made me a different person all

4080.24 --> 4083.5589999999997
of it combined

4101.12 --> 4104.12
mm-hmm

4108.719 --> 4113.0
no i'm not a vegan or vegetarian

4118.159 --> 4123.839
i mean two years ago i had a year

4121.359 --> 4126.400000000001
eating vegetarian

4123.839 --> 4128.239
because i felt like it i felt that i

4126.4 --> 4131.719
should be doing that

4128.239 --> 4131.718999999999
and then it stopped

4150.88 --> 4156.0
yeah pj khrushchek i think it's like a a

4153.52 --> 4159.359
bit of a localist thing between these

4156.0 --> 4160.64
two return to normal and

4159.359 --> 4163.279
aries

4160.64 --> 4163.279
since its

4163.359 --> 4168.159000000001
aries is scottish and returned to normal

4166.08 --> 4170.5599999999995
is british and it seems to be like

4168.159 --> 4173.799
they're bumping

4170.56 --> 4173.799
with that

4184.799 --> 4187.799
foreign

4209.56 --> 4215.679
congratulations for trying no

4212.96 --> 4218.08
i'm not i wasn't trying i just didn't

4215.679 --> 4220.4
feel like eating meat for a year i

4218.08 --> 4222.96
didn't even have like

4220.4 --> 4227.44
like the smell didn't even smell right

4222.96 --> 4231.6
but then after a year it was like oh man

4227.44 --> 4233.12
it's back and my body's calling for it

4231.6 --> 4236.0
i'm not trying

4233.12 --> 4238.5599999999995
no i'm going to eat meat yeah i'm going

4236.0 --> 4241.92
to eat meat you know why

4238.56 --> 4244.56
because both jesus christ and rudolf

4241.92 --> 4246.88
steiner condone it

4244.56 --> 4246.88
yeah

4247.199 --> 4253.599999999999
there you go

4249.28 --> 4255.84
i will eat meat i will eat meat

4253.6 --> 4259.719
if i can

4255.84 --> 4259.719
and if it's good meat

4293.199 --> 4298.719
okay bloom big brook

4295.76 --> 4302.0
oh yeah but that's

4298.719 --> 4305.52
i took bloom i took the big berkey for

4302.0 --> 4307.679
the tank the tank i loved loved it it

4305.52 --> 4309.679
lasts a lifetime

4307.679 --> 4311.92
but i get the filters not from big

4309.679 --> 4314.4800000000005
berkey they have these

4311.92 --> 4317.04
carbon chunk filters i don't think

4314.48 --> 4318.32
they're very good they break down

4317.04 --> 4319.84
like

4318.32 --> 4321.679
way too quickly

4319.84 --> 4324.08
there's other filters

4321.679 --> 4325.1990000000005
other companies that only sell those

4324.08 --> 4328.5599999999995
filters

4325.199 --> 4333.12
they're very good i've had a couple that

4328.56 --> 4335.52
literally just have lasted over 10 years

4333.12 --> 4338.64
and they i can still continue using them

4335.52 --> 4339.6
although i would kind of like a new set

4338.64 --> 4340.84
of that

4339.6 --> 4344.8
but that's gonna

4340.84 --> 4350.2390000000005
cost that's gonna cost me like

4344.8 --> 4350.2390000000005
she i've moved 160 euros or something

4351.679 --> 4354.719
what is the name

4354.8 --> 4359.04
what do you mean

4357.36 --> 4361.44
the name

4359.04 --> 4364.4
you mean of those filters i don't even

4361.44 --> 4366.48
remember i don't even remember

4364.4 --> 4368.159
it doesn't say on the filter itself it

4366.48 --> 4372.919999999999
said on the package and i threw that

4368.159 --> 4372.92
away 10 years ago so

4386.92 --> 4390.029
[Music]

4406.239 --> 4410.12
all right that should work

4412.0 --> 4414.56
oh wow

4414.96 --> 4418.08
that's freaking cheap

4425.28 --> 4428.88
right i think i got these

4433.28 --> 4438.4
the name

4434.88 --> 4441.52
is extr but there's different sorts

4438.4 --> 4442.96
they're like they have several versions

4441.52 --> 4444.64
of that

4442.96 --> 4447.44
but this is kind of what it looks like

4444.64 --> 4449.1990000000005
this is roughly the name of it when i

4447.44 --> 4451.36
bought it but yeah that was like eight

4449.199 --> 4452.96
years ago or 10 years ago

4451.36 --> 4455.839999999999
so

4452.96 --> 4455.84
now wait more

4457.76 --> 4463.360000000001
2008

4459.44 --> 4463.36
yeah that's like 13 years ago anyway

4465.44 --> 4469.839999999999
i think it's the right brand and the

4467.28 --> 4469.84
right type

4470.64 --> 4473.12
but those are

4472.159 --> 4477.639999999999
that's

4473.12 --> 4477.64
what i remember it being called

4485.199 --> 4488.5199999999995
right there

4509.6 --> 4516.4400000000005
did you get ever get the air filter

4511.92 --> 4516.4400000000005
replaced no no i didn't

4537.6 --> 4542.400000000001
i mean i wouldn't mind having it

4540.0 --> 4545.12
replaced but yeah

4542.4 --> 4548.08
oh if you guys could just

4545.12 --> 4550.8
just like that just conjure up like 500

4548.08 --> 4555.0
euros that would be great right but

4550.8 --> 4555.0
that's probably not gonna happen

4624.56 --> 4628.76
oh hello by the way amanda young

4652.84 --> 4656.2390000000005
demineralized water

4658.32 --> 4663.4
yeah that's reverse osmosis right

4687.76 --> 4693.1990000000005
that's the point that's what i just said

4690.0 --> 4697.08
yes reverse osmosis removes the minerals

4693.199 --> 4697.08
as well that's why it's demineralized

4711.679 --> 4715.1990000000005
what about drinking rain water

4715.679 --> 4719.92
well

4717.679 --> 4722.64
yeah plants probably have no problem

4719.92 --> 4722.64
with that but

4726.8 --> 4731.6
i don't it depends on where you're at

4729.84 --> 4735.76
right because the rainwater is also

4731.6 --> 4738.2390000000005
gonna bring any like air pollutants

4735.76 --> 4739.6
smoke and [ __ ] whatever it's also going

4738.239 --> 4741.919999999999
to

4739.6 --> 4743.76
get in there right

4741.92 --> 4746.4
so you might want to filter it first

4743.76 --> 4746.400000000001
that's right

4747.76 --> 4753.4400000000005
now maybe just a

4749.44 --> 4756.159
sand filter would be sufficient right

4753.44 --> 4759.44
if you just have like a

4756.159 --> 4762.679
a really big bucket of sand with a hole

4759.44 --> 4762.678999999999
at the bottom

4764.32 --> 4768.5599999999995
and then like slowly pour it in at the

4766.48 --> 4770.08
top and it's gonna just go through the

4768.56 --> 4772.320000000001
sand

4770.08 --> 4774.5599999999995
that's gonna be pretty clean

4772.32 --> 4778.08
right although after a long time you do

4774.56 --> 4780.64
have to then replace the sand

4778.08 --> 4782.96
so that like if you really want a cheap

4780.64 --> 4785.52
ass filter and not some

4782.96 --> 4788.159
fabricated

4785.52 --> 4791.679
carbon filter thingy or whatever then

4788.159 --> 4794.719
you could just use a big bucket of sand

4791.679 --> 4796.64
with a hole in the bottom and like a uh

4794.719 --> 4799.44
a nozzle so

4796.64 --> 4802.320000000001
sand doesn't just fall out of there

4799.44 --> 4805.639999999999
that could potentially work as a rain

4802.32 --> 4805.639999999999
water filter

4819.28 --> 4824.88
yeah pj krishan there is no chemtrails

4822.239 --> 4824.879999999999
in general

4826.96 --> 4832.32
that's not

4828.239 --> 4834.239
chemical it's not toxic it can't be if

4832.32 --> 4835.599999999999
all those freaking cramped trails were

4834.239 --> 4837.919999999999
toxic

4835.6 --> 4840.719
then everything would be withering and

4837.92 --> 4840.719
dying now

4841.44 --> 4845.599999999999
that's not happening

4843.6 --> 4849.120000000001
like the amount of poison in the

4845.6 --> 4852.120000000001
groundwater would be off the charts

4849.12 --> 4852.12
palpable

4872.719 --> 4879.679
use charcoal sure dude you can throw

4875.28 --> 4879.679
charcoal in there sure if you have it

4880.159 --> 4885.28
you could just take a big bucket

4882.8 --> 4887.84
filled with like really good

4885.28 --> 4889.84
oh this is the ultimate

4887.84 --> 4894.159000000001
really fine

4889.84 --> 4897.6
white sand clean fine white sand not

4894.159 --> 4900.48
like the sticky type of sand

4897.6 --> 4901.52
preferably and then combine it with just

4900.48 --> 4903.199
freaking

4901.52 --> 4906.320000000001
charcoal in there

4903.199 --> 4909.759999999999
like little granules or you could

4906.32 --> 4913.199
literally just take charcoal smash it up

4909.76 --> 4915.52
and put yeah just mix it all in together

4913.199 --> 4919.04
super white sand and charcoal that would

4915.52 --> 4919.040000000001
make a great filter i bet

4929.52 --> 4933.76
but yeah there's been a lot of

4930.96 --> 4934.8
industrial research to how to what the

4933.76 --> 4936.639
best

4934.8 --> 4939.76
ways to flour

4936.639 --> 4939.76
to filter water

4940.639 --> 4946.159000000001
so if you want to get real engineery

4943.36 --> 4948.32
with it and not so much improvise then

4946.159 --> 4950.879999999999
there's a lot of research out there to

4948.32 --> 4954.199
be found about this if you really know

4950.88 --> 4954.1990000000005
where to look

4970.96 --> 4976.2390000000005
no that's not true ben white

4973.6 --> 4977.84
i already explained this earlier in the

4976.239 --> 4978.959999999999
hag out

4977.84 --> 4982.400000000001
no

4978.96 --> 4985.6
no there is something a way in which

4982.4 --> 4988.5599999999995
fluoride helps your teeth

4985.6 --> 4990.56
like even the weird sodium fluoride one

4988.56 --> 4992.639
not just calcium fluoride and that is

4990.56 --> 4994.8
through topical

4992.639 --> 4998.639
like direct

4994.8 --> 5000.400000000001
topical application to the enamel

4998.639 --> 5003.6
of your teeth it does

5000.4 --> 5005.599999999999
apparently harden it and make it less

5003.6 --> 5007.84
brittle

5005.6 --> 5010.320000000001
so the studies have shown

5007.84 --> 5013.360000000001
i think that probably works it doesn't

5010.32 --> 5015.48
do the opposite it's just that

5013.36 --> 5018.719
every other

5015.48 --> 5021.04
association with it is bad if you like

5018.719 --> 5023.44
get it in your mouth it's absorbed by

5021.04 --> 5026.0
the gums it's bad if you put it in the

5023.44 --> 5028.48
water you drink it up it's bad if you

5026.0 --> 5031.6
have the concentrated form

5028.48 --> 5033.759999999999
and you like even absorb it on your skin

5031.6 --> 5036.0
you're gonna get poisoned it's bad

5033.76 --> 5038.400000000001
everything about it is bad except

5036.0 --> 5040.84
apparently when you only apply it

5038.4 --> 5045.4
topically to the enamel of your

5040.84 --> 5045.400000000001
teeth that's a fact

5056.239 --> 5058.959999999999
so yeah

5059.04 --> 5065.5199999999995
if you say it's only bad like it there

5062.0 --> 5067.679
is no justification to apply or to

5065.52 --> 5069.280000000001
associate it with teeth

5067.679 --> 5070.96
you're wrong

5069.28 --> 5072.96
that's not true

5070.96 --> 5075.52
it's just that it

5072.96 --> 5078.32
it is one of the most inconvenient

5075.52 --> 5080.719
substances to use for anything

5078.32 --> 5085.0
health related because it is also so

5080.719 --> 5085.0
toxic right how ironic

5086.08 --> 5090.08
yeah but that's just the way it works

5091.04 --> 5097.639
i'm sorry if that complicates things in

5093.36 --> 5097.639
your mind but it's true

5106.239 --> 5110.959999999999
although i bet here here's the tricky

5109.52 --> 5114.159000000001
part i bet

5110.96 --> 5115.679
you could harden the enamel

5114.159 --> 5118.879999999999
of your teeth

5115.679 --> 5121.04
through another substance

5118.88 --> 5123.76
that would do just as good a job and

5121.04 --> 5125.679
would not be toxic at all i bet i bet

5123.76 --> 5126.639
that also exists

5125.679 --> 5130.32
right

5126.639 --> 5133.28
and by that notion it is very likely

5130.32 --> 5134.48
that the whole experiment of who hardens

5133.28 --> 5138.8
your enable

5134.48 --> 5140.718999999999
was a stunt it was a stunt to try

5138.8 --> 5143.76
to get that poison

5140.719 --> 5144.56
somehow associated with health

5143.76 --> 5147.280000000001
that

5144.56 --> 5150.0
i would go that far

5147.28 --> 5153.5199999999995
it's not like oh my god i know it's such

5150.0 --> 5156.28
a poison sodium fluoride but we got to

5153.52 --> 5158.96
like we cannot forget about this

5156.28 --> 5161.759999999999
miraculous super ability that hardens

5158.96 --> 5164.0
your enamel no that's not how that went

5161.76 --> 5166.4800000000005
i'm pretty sure they just did widespread

5164.0 --> 5168.8
research

5166.48 --> 5171.28
dentistry research and then found like

5168.8 --> 5173.52
hey yeah that it does seem like this

5171.28 --> 5175.759999999999
[ __ ] hardens it up

5173.52 --> 5179.040000000001
oh we could probably

5175.76 --> 5180.639
make money with that right rebel gravel

5179.04 --> 5183.84
gravel

5180.639 --> 5183.84
i think that's how it went

5187.04 --> 5192.0
because i bet there are

5189.6 --> 5194.8
much much less toxic substances that'll

5192.0 --> 5196.639
do just the same

5194.8 --> 5200.76
but you don't have to worry about it

5196.639 --> 5200.76
being absorbed by your gums

5213.12 --> 5216.8
i've also family the same fluoride

5215.44 --> 5218.879999999999
benefit right

5216.8 --> 5222.2390000000005
yeah but i think that putting it in your

5218.88 --> 5225.84
toothpaste also doesn't work

5222.239 --> 5225.839999999999
i think that is a misapplication

5226.08 --> 5229.5199999999995
because

5227.44 --> 5231.759999999999
you get it in your gums

5229.52 --> 5234.56
right

5231.76 --> 5237.1990000000005
so yeah fluoride in toothpaste

5234.56 --> 5238.96
i officially think that's completely

5237.199 --> 5241.36
useless

5238.96 --> 5244.8
just as fluoride

5241.36 --> 5247.599999999999
sodium fluoride in water is completely

5244.8 --> 5248.320000000001
useless it's actually counterproductive

5247.6 --> 5252.2390000000005
it's

5248.32 --> 5255.5199999999995
yeah bad bad for everything

5252.239 --> 5255.5199999999995
that's what i think about it

5258.159 --> 5263.199
but that doesn't mean that applying

5260.4 --> 5265.199
sodium fluoride topically to your enamel

5263.199 --> 5268.0
doesn't harden it

5265.199 --> 5270.08
is just that it doesn't really matter

5268.0 --> 5274.88
that much in the face of all the other

5270.08 --> 5274.88
side effects that you should be wary of

5278.0 --> 5284.719
now you're not listening ben white i'm

5280.56 --> 5284.719
talking about factual studies

5285.199 --> 5291.599999999999
you ha do you oh i have been misinformed

5288.159 --> 5295.36
oh reheat so are you a dentist ben white

5291.6 --> 5299.1990000000005
are you a practicing dentist yeah

5295.36 --> 5299.199
because i used to live with one

5299.44 --> 5302.96
you you think i'm just blabbering out of

5301.679 --> 5304.88
my ass

5302.96 --> 5307.36
no i know what the [ __ ] i'm talking

5304.88 --> 5310.96
about when it comes to these subjects

5307.36 --> 5310.96
because i was living with one

5318.719 --> 5322.639
yeah

5320.32 --> 5324.88
i know what i'm talking about it does

5322.639 --> 5326.4800000000005
actually help it's just is it worth it

5324.88 --> 5328.639
in the face of all the other side

5326.48 --> 5332.0
effects that's the question the answer

5328.639 --> 5334.96
would be in my personal opinion no

5332.0 --> 5336.56
and definitely not to widespread apply

5334.96 --> 5339.52
it to

5336.56 --> 5342.159000000001
consumption products like fluoridated

5339.52 --> 5344.56
water or toothpaste i am against that i

5342.159 --> 5346.08
am against fluor sodium fluoride being

5344.56 --> 5350.4400000000005
applied to

5346.08 --> 5350.44
general consumption products

5353.92 --> 5356.159
good

5363.12 --> 5368.4
that's right from the grade

5366.0 --> 5371.36
i there used to be warning labels alex

5368.4 --> 5373.199
jones showed them one time i don't know

5371.36 --> 5375.12
if they're still on there

5373.199 --> 5378.4
or if the do but

5375.12 --> 5380.8
there used to be like warning labels

5378.4 --> 5382.5599999999995
sometimes on the tube sometimes on the

5380.8 --> 5385.76
the piece of paper that came with it

5382.56 --> 5388.320000000001
like if you swallow even a pea-sized

5385.76 --> 5390.08
amount of toothpaste immediately call

5388.32 --> 5393.36
your doctor

5390.08 --> 5394.96
serious this is that's real they and i

5393.36 --> 5396.159
think they had to put it on there

5394.96 --> 5398.08
because

5396.159 --> 5400.0
it is so toxic

5398.08 --> 5402.5599999999995
isn't that crazy

5400.0 --> 5404.96
well what they don't say that oh swallow

5402.56 --> 5406.400000000001
you say so what if you take like you

5404.96 --> 5409.04
squirt

5406.4 --> 5411.28
like a big spoon of that [ __ ] and you

5409.04 --> 5411.28
just

5411.44 --> 5414.799999999999
you just

5412.639 --> 5416.4800000000005
twirl it around in your mouth

5414.8 --> 5418.4800000000005
and then spit it out you think that's

5416.48 --> 5421.12
gonna poison you

5418.48 --> 5422.799999999999
i bet it will

5421.12 --> 5424.639
i bet it will because it's gonna be

5422.8 --> 5426.2390000000005
absorbed by your gums it's gonna get

5424.639 --> 5427.92
into your bloodstream

5426.239 --> 5430.638999999999
right you

5427.92 --> 5433.12
swallowing things is not the only way

5430.639 --> 5437.1990000000005
you get things in your system

5433.12 --> 5437.199
your gums absorb things

5439.12 --> 5445.199
right especially the area

5441.52 --> 5445.1990000000005
right here underneath the tongue

5446.96 --> 5450.88
that's why with some uh

5450.96 --> 5456.4800000000005
herbal medicines and other stuff

5454.48 --> 5458.48
vitamin droplets often they tell you

5456.48 --> 5461.12
drip it under the tongue why because it

5458.48 --> 5463.44
gets really quickly absorbed

5461.12 --> 5465.12
so guess what else it's going to really

5463.44 --> 5468.48
quickly absorb

5465.12 --> 5470.4
when you get it under the tongue

5468.48 --> 5471.678999999999
sodium fluoride

5470.4 --> 5473.12
right

5471.679 --> 5475.28
so yeah

5473.12 --> 5477.5199999999995
call the doctor if you swallow a

5475.28 --> 5480.32
pea-sized or fluoridated toothpaste

5477.52 --> 5482.8
immediately okay so what about if i take

5480.32 --> 5485.44
an entire tube and squash it around in

5482.8 --> 5488.0
my mouth and spit it out again

5485.44 --> 5489.44
i you probably need a doctor at that

5488.0 --> 5491.84
point too

5489.44 --> 5491.839999999999
probably

5495.84 --> 5499.8
yeah it's a crazy world

5529.199 --> 5533.599999999999
this is

5531.44 --> 5536.239
the dentist show

5533.6 --> 5538.96

6009.92 --> 6013.679
just that

6011.119 --> 6016.0
even though i don't plan anything for

6013.679 --> 6018.8
these things the people that surround me

6016.0 --> 6020.48

6087.119 --> 6090.5199999999995
you think that

6120.56 --> 6125.04
i mean technically i think i probably

6123.04 --> 6127.6
still could do that

6125.04 --> 6130.0
at some point if i really feel like it

6127.6 --> 6133.280000000001
but it's gonna be for fun

6130.0 --> 6136.0
only fun only to kind of like remember

6133.28 --> 6139.119
back my old days in how i grew up which

6136.0 --> 6143.36
is literally always having music around

6139.119 --> 6146.799999999999
me and not shitty radio top

6143.36 --> 6152.159
top of the pops music no actual

6146.8 --> 6152.159000000001
life being played music on piano guitar

6152.719 --> 6156.88
studio recording stuff because that's

6154.719 --> 6159.84
what my parents used to do

6156.88 --> 6161.679
my entire youth they were musicians and

6159.84 --> 6165.4400000000005
musician teachers

6161.679 --> 6165.4400000000005
and studio recording stuff

6166.4 --> 6171.599999999999
and i kind of miss that i have it in me

6168.719 --> 6173.52
i have the ability i know how to sing i

6171.6 --> 6177.84
really know how to whistle and i

6173.52 --> 6177.84
absolutely know how to

6179.6 --> 6182.8
parrot

6181.52 --> 6186.080000000001
melody

6182.8 --> 6189.6
i i know melody i know how it works

6186.08 --> 6191.76
i just i can't write it i chose to not

6189.6 --> 6194.8
be able to

6191.76 --> 6197.6
i can't do it i can't do it

6194.8 --> 6202.360000000001
i chose not to because i want to

6197.6 --> 6202.360000000001
live the music and not make it

6205.44 --> 6209.919999999999
but i could definitely like play i guess

6212.96 --> 6220.2390000000005
tastes funnily no i'm not a great fan

6216.96 --> 6222.56
but vaguely remi

6220.239 --> 6224.799999999999
rings a bell that's pretty old stuff

6222.56 --> 6224.8
right

6228.48 --> 6232.44
or is this some new guy

6233.44 --> 6238.799999999999
can you beat box

6235.679 --> 6238.8
i probably could

6244.4 --> 6248.96
he was in for i don't know what that is

6247.04 --> 6251.119
dude dude

6248.96 --> 6253.28
are you actually asking me like what

6251.119 --> 6254.799999999999
happened on the music scene in the last

6253.28 --> 6256.8
20 years

6254.8 --> 6259.76
because i don't know

6256.8 --> 6262.719
no wait last 10 years before that i sort

6259.76 --> 6262.719
of kept track but

6264.719 --> 6269.44
excellent

6267.04 --> 6269.44
okay

6273.52 --> 6279.280000000001
right right right okay

6275.76 --> 6279.280000000001
well then i might have heard about it

6279.679 --> 6283.04
but

6281.199 --> 6285.5199999999995
like

6283.04 --> 6286.84
focus was okay okay

6285.52 --> 6289.360000000001
that's

6286.84 --> 6292.159000000001
weird i

6289.36 --> 6295.759999999999
and my parents were not

6292.159 --> 6296.799999999999
into dutch music at all

6295.76 --> 6299.84
at all

6296.8 --> 6300.96
we're all about the english

6299.84 --> 6302.719
and like

6300.96 --> 6305.84
funk

6302.719 --> 6305.84
and jazz

6306.0 --> 6311.52
and rock

6308.639 --> 6314.08
they were very much like

6311.52 --> 6316.0
that direction we didn't like dutch

6314.08 --> 6318.08
music we didn't like really to like

6316.0 --> 6320.08
dutch spoken music even though there is

6318.08 --> 6322.48
there's some really good music dutch

6320.08 --> 6324.96
musical artists out there and i've met

6322.48 --> 6327.119
people that were a lot big very big fans

6324.96 --> 6329.28
of them

6327.119 --> 6332.239
i was just not on that frequency it

6329.28 --> 6332.239
never really was

6332.4 --> 6335.5199999999995
do i drink tea

6337.84 --> 6342.76
do you go to the toilet every day

6345.92 --> 6351.88
when you open your eyes do you see

6348.88 --> 6351.88
something

6358.33 --> 6361.5689999999995
[Music]

6373.44 --> 6379.879999999999
yeah do you think that's area breathing

6376.88 --> 6379.88
hmm

6389.199 --> 6393.599999999999
i see dumb people

6391.04 --> 6395.84
all the time

6393.6 --> 6398.719
is that sixth sense sixth sense

6395.84 --> 6401.6
reference that's brilliant

6398.719 --> 6404.8
not non-fluoridated air dude

6401.6 --> 6407.1990000000005
you can actually fluoridate air

6404.8 --> 6409.52
but that's literally chemical warfare

6407.199 --> 6412.638999999999
extremely dead dated

6409.52 --> 6414.88
that like what is it fluorine gas or

6412.639 --> 6416.56
something like that no wait that's

6414.88 --> 6418.719
chlorine gas

6416.56 --> 6420.88
that's something else yeah that's by the

6418.719 --> 6423.28
way extremely toxic

6420.88 --> 6424.88
but like you can basically do that i

6423.28 --> 6427.199
think

6424.88 --> 6427.1990000000005
it's like

6427.6 --> 6431.1990000000005
don't do that

6428.96 --> 6433.92
it's by the way extremely illegal even

6431.199 --> 6433.919999999999
in warfare

6434.32 --> 6437.599999999999
do i collect my t2 no

6436.56 --> 6439.84
like

6437.6 --> 6439.84
tea

6439.92 --> 6445.52
does not really grow all that easily in

6442.8 --> 6447.6
the netherlands

6445.52 --> 6449.6
like you'd have to have a special

6447.6 --> 6451.679
greenhouse

6449.6 --> 6455.119000000001
for that here

6451.679 --> 6457.84
to be able to grow your own tea i think

6455.119 --> 6457.839999999999
because it's

6458.56 --> 6463.119000000001
t is not really optimal in moderate

6461.119 --> 6466.719
climates

6463.119 --> 6469.96
you'd have to have a like subtropical

6466.719 --> 6469.96
at least

6473.28 --> 6477.719
it doesn't handle cold well

6488.4 --> 6493.4
hey guns i've never run rmp good to see

6490.4 --> 6493.4
you

6508.719 --> 6511.719
uh

6526.159 --> 6530.04
hardcore raven

6544.639 --> 6550.0
do you think there is a possibility of

6546.719 --> 6551.119
more land not shown on conventional maps

6550.0 --> 6553.44
yeah

6551.119 --> 6555.36
dude i think there's literally more

6553.44 --> 6558.4
space

6555.36 --> 6560.159
potentially more space

6558.4 --> 6562.879999999999
like on the map

6560.159 --> 6565.04
that just doesn't fit

6562.88 --> 6567.679
so they just leave it out that there

6565.04 --> 6569.76
could be potentially entire continents

6567.679 --> 6572.56
right in the middle of it all

6569.76 --> 6573.679
but you would have to hit a very narrow

6572.56 --> 6576.159000000001
space

6573.679 --> 6578.8
in order to enter it as if you're going

6576.159 --> 6582.48
inside a tunnel with an entire pocket of

6578.8 --> 6585.119000000001
other space right spatial non-linearity

6582.48 --> 6587.678999999999
the doctor who tardis effect

6585.119 --> 6590.92
that might literally exist in this world

6587.679 --> 6594.159
there might literally be entire

6590.92 --> 6597.1990000000005
continent-sized islands hidden in a very

6594.159 --> 6600.5599999999995
small space not underground literally on

6597.199 --> 6602.879999999999
the surface flat surface an island right

6600.56 --> 6602.88
there

6603.04 --> 6610.0
within the space within the space and it

6607.119 --> 6612.239
doesn't fit and you can very easily just

6610.0 --> 6614.4
move past it without ever getting to see

6612.239 --> 6614.4
it

6615.36 --> 6620.159
that not underground right there in a

6618.4 --> 6622.4
straight line you can move straight

6620.159 --> 6626.48
toward it if you actually know exactly

6622.4 --> 6629.679
how to get the right angle of approach

6626.48 --> 6632.799999999999
to where the space becomes more dense

6629.679 --> 6635.28
right this is very theoretical this is

6632.8 --> 6635.28
spatial

6636.84 --> 6640.4800000000005
non-linearity but yeah

6642.0 --> 6645.119
just imagine like

6646.159 --> 6652.08
let's just say jamaica right jamaica we

6649.599 --> 6655.360000000001
know it's an island it's not a super

6652.08 --> 6658.4
large island but it's a it's like yeah

6655.36 --> 6659.5199999999995
okay you can definitely spot it on a map

6658.4 --> 6661.44
what if

6659.52 --> 6663.360000000001
the total

6661.44 --> 6665.759999999999
a circle if you take a circle around

6663.36 --> 6668.5599999999995
jamaica

6665.76 --> 6670.96
then somewhere else that circle

6668.56 --> 6672.88
and then when you approach that circle

6670.96 --> 6674.96
you can just go past it and you would

6672.88 --> 6677.119
never see anything but if you would hit

6674.96 --> 6679.199
that circle dead on

6677.119 --> 6683.199
that suddenly

6679.199 --> 6686.159
let's just say a mexican sized island

6683.199 --> 6689.04
for some reason fits in there

6686.159 --> 6691.759999999999
a mexico sized island

6689.04 --> 6695.679
within a circle that that would only fit

6691.76 --> 6698.8
jamaica right that might exist somewhere

6695.679 --> 6702.08
here in the realm in the known realm

6698.8 --> 6706.76
not even beyond the polls or anything

6702.08 --> 6706.76
i think this is a legitimate possibility

6708.639 --> 6715.04
and not other dimensional it's this

6710.719 --> 6716.639
dimension this dimension the 3d realm

6715.04 --> 6719.599
dimension

6716.639 --> 6721.76
this physical known space directly

6719.599 --> 6722.639
interconnecting to where you are right

6721.76 --> 6726.719
now

6722.639 --> 6728.400000000001
this realm no other dimension no phasing

6726.719 --> 6732.0
it's just

6728.4 --> 6734.96
space as we gotten to know it seems all

6732.0 --> 6737.36
pretty euclidian right well who's to say

6734.96 --> 6740.36
it is euclidean how do you know

6737.36 --> 6740.36
definitively

6741.28 --> 6745.44
well you can simply find out whether it

6744.0 --> 6746.48
isn't

6745.44 --> 6749.5199999999995
linear

6746.48 --> 6752.32
it isn't all perfectly euclidean space

6749.52 --> 6754.96
might not be linear the way

6752.32 --> 6758.88
space is divided out within the

6754.96 --> 6760.96
euclidean confines of the realm

6758.88 --> 6763.119
might simply yield that it's not linear

6760.96 --> 6766.2390000000005
and that there are regions where the

6763.119 --> 6767.839999999999
space is more compacted more fits in

6766.239 --> 6769.36
there

6767.84 --> 6772.159000000001
then could

6769.36 --> 6773.839999999999
fit if every if the spatial divisions of

6772.159 --> 6777.36
all things was just one-on-one

6773.84 --> 6779.92
everywhere right spatial non-linearity

6777.36 --> 6781.839999999999
this might be possible

6779.92 --> 6784.08
right and with that

6781.84 --> 6785.119000000001
fantastical note i'm gonna round out the

6784.08 --> 6787.599
show
