101.2 --> 104.72
right

102.479 --> 105.759
so whether today is

104.72 --> 108.24
again

105.759 --> 108.24
beautiful

111.28 --> 117.43900000000001
no clouds oh look there's a little moon

114.64 --> 117.43900000000001
sliver up there

118.24 --> 122.56
i don't know if you can if the camera

119.759 --> 122.56
can pick that up

125.759 --> 132.56
but yeah no clouds

128.959 --> 134.239
planes aren't really leaving trails

132.56 --> 135.76
or if they are they're being blown away

134.239 --> 137.59900000000002
quickly

135.76 --> 139.599
because there is

137.599 --> 143.2
a substantial amount of wind

139.599 --> 146.319
has been throughout the night as well

143.2 --> 146.319
but yeah no rain

147.28 --> 152.4
and the sun is like really nice and warm

150.959 --> 155.12
inside

152.4 --> 157.36
that's also why i'm

155.12 --> 159.68
not wearing my sweater

157.36 --> 163.0
i might put it on a little later

159.68 --> 163.0
in the show

170.8 --> 177.519
hello crockett first in chat kevlar

174.0 --> 177.519
borders boy good to see you

177.84 --> 183.959
it is tuesday the 8th of march 2022

189.76 --> 195.12
yeah

191.68 --> 195.12
see what i'm gonna do today

195.84 --> 201.68
i had a bit of a

197.2 --> 201.67999999999998
bit i've had a very weird day yesterday

206.4 --> 211.20000000000002
i actually ended up sleeping throughout

208.959 --> 213.04
most of the evening

211.2 --> 215.35999999999999
it was weird

213.04 --> 217.04
because yeah i had been drinking my

215.36 --> 219.36
beers and all that

217.04 --> 221.04
and then i was like

219.36 --> 224.87900000000002
no i'm gonna do some last minute

221.04 --> 227.519
shopping and i basically went

224.879 --> 229.28
yeah i went shopping sorted with a lot

227.519 --> 231.12
of elko in me

229.28 --> 232.64000000000001
and that's always a weird experience

231.12 --> 235.04
interesting though it's really like your

232.64 --> 239.439
sporting all of a sudden

235.04 --> 242.79899999999998
but then when i got back i almost

239.439 --> 244.159
is sort of passed out

242.799 --> 247.04000000000002
and then

244.159 --> 249.12
yeah i had just made dinner and then i

247.04 --> 250.879
literally just like oh i have to lie

249.12 --> 253.84
down right now

250.879 --> 257.76
and then i just woke up like four

253.84 --> 257.76
o'clock at night really weird

258.959 --> 260.72
so

259.68 --> 263.919
yeah

260.72 --> 263.91900000000004
i haven't eaten a lot

264.0 --> 267.36
and i feel a little wobbly because of

266.0 --> 269.84
that

267.36 --> 269.84000000000003
weird

280.56 --> 283.84
hey matthew hall

285.919 --> 289.75899999999996
right but i'll be all right

287.759 --> 292.88
i'm just like it feels like i'm a little

289.759 --> 292.88
slower than usual

294.32 --> 297.32
uh

307.28 --> 311.52
right so yesterday's flat earth debate

309.44 --> 312.71999999999997
was pretty good

311.52 --> 316.24
everybody was

312.72 --> 316.24
very clear-headed

316.4 --> 321.67999999999995
and then in the after show at some point

318.88 --> 324.479
akuma virus did come in

321.68 --> 327.039
and it was one of those shows again

324.479 --> 330.0
so nathan basically went

327.039 --> 332.56
grinding down on him

330.0 --> 333.52
for several hours last quite quite a

332.56 --> 336.08
while

333.52 --> 338.56
and like the panel just couldn't get in

336.08 --> 340.15999999999997
between there so but it was it was kind

338.56 --> 342.479
of just like the

340.16 --> 345.84000000000003
the six hour show

342.479 --> 349.32
except it was only a kumu virus

345.84 --> 349.32
hey rick peck

352.4 --> 355.75899999999996
so that was kind of hilarious

358.88 --> 362.96
and that's about it

360.56 --> 367.16
yeah i watched a bit of owen benjamin

362.96 --> 367.15999999999997
this morning before the show

375.919 --> 378.919
right

380.0 --> 383.6
and yeah it's

381.6 --> 386.40000000000003
through like an hour and 15 minutes and

383.6 --> 386.40000000000003
it's interesting

393.199 --> 395.84000000000003
and that's it

398.56 --> 402.319
so i'm a bit of a blank slate

406.0 --> 411.68
i thought yesterday show early bird show

408.56 --> 411.68
was kind of fun though

412.0 --> 418.96
just actually being about flat earth and

415.52 --> 418.96
and the globe cosmology

419.199 --> 424.72
testing it

421.759 --> 426.96000000000004
but yeah it does bring out the global in

424.72 --> 430.319
the globers in my chat and that is kind

426.96 --> 430.31899999999996
of annoying right

434.8 --> 437.84000000000003
but yeah what can you do

441.84 --> 446.23999999999995
how long are benjamin shows usually

446.479 --> 451.84
most of them are like

448.56 --> 451.84
three hours

452.479 --> 456.4
wizard war three was four hours

456.56 --> 460.319
but most of them are like around three

458.479 --> 462.0
hours

460.319 --> 464.40000000000003
or a little over

462.0 --> 467.4
very long like i don't know how he does

464.4 --> 467.4
it

483.199 --> 486.479
all right

484.639 --> 487.68
yeah well glad you have good weather too

486.479 --> 492.12
mortise boy

487.68 --> 492.12
i've certainly been enjoying it

517.279 --> 520.279
uh

524.48 --> 527.48
um

536.16 --> 539.16
so

556.08 --> 561.8000000000001
yeah yeah human solar panels that's

558.8 --> 561.8
right

564.24 --> 568.9590000000001
but it's kind of tough because like if i

566.72 --> 570.24
just go outside and stand in the sun

568.959 --> 573.1199999999999
then

570.24 --> 577.16
my t-shirts absolutely yeah that's not

573.12 --> 577.16
gonna work i'm gonna freeze

583.44 --> 588.32
maybe potentially a solution could be if

586.24 --> 590.399
you'd have a big mirror

588.32 --> 592.24
and you just place that mirror outside

590.399 --> 594.72
of

592.24 --> 597.44
your window in the right angle and then

594.72 --> 599.9200000000001
have big swath of sun basically shine

597.44 --> 599.9200000000001
inside

602.0 --> 607.079
and then you don't have to face the cold

604.079 --> 607.079
wind

622.8 --> 628.7199999999999
yeah rick back yeah no own benjamin just

626.16 --> 630.079
really really triggers a whole range of

628.72 --> 633.839
gammas

630.079 --> 636.079
really bad and they go completely ape

633.839 --> 636.0790000000001
[ __ ]

637.12 --> 642.36
like

638.16 --> 642.36
and worse than i get

666.079 --> 669.079
uh

721.519 --> 727.12
you like the idea of gammas really

724.639 --> 731.5600000000001
i don't like them

727.12 --> 731.5600000000001
but yeah it is a pretty good identifier

739.76 --> 744.8
the terminologies comes from fox day

742.88 --> 747.8389999999999
don't know if you heard of him it's like

744.8 --> 747.8389999999999
benjamin's colleague

748.88 --> 754.959
helped him build

751.279 --> 754.959
the the website and all that

755.839 --> 762.8000000000001
unauthorized tv but yeah he came up with

759.92 --> 765.04
the social sexual hierarchy

762.8 --> 768.3199999999999
of which gammas is a part and it's a

765.04 --> 768.3199999999999
really interesting system

770.0 --> 775.68
i still have to kind of master it like i

772.959 --> 775.68
understand

775.76 --> 780.399
like

776.72 --> 785.279
i understand that it it really works

780.399 --> 785.279
i just don't understand yet exactly how

785.519 --> 789.839
i don't know every detail like i don't

787.6 --> 789.839
know

790.0 --> 795.12
how it was figured out yet it's gonna

792.48 --> 797.44
take some more time

795.12 --> 801.76
because yeah i just i would have to

797.44 --> 804.1600000000001
analyze more social behavior right and

801.76 --> 806.56
social behavior overall isn't my best

804.16 --> 806.56
talent

806.72 --> 810.88
i'm more about like inner psychology

812.56 --> 817.68
and not like how people compose

814.72 --> 819.9200000000001
themselves towards other people

817.68 --> 822.7199999999999
that's been like

819.92 --> 824.3199999999999
yeah a skill in which i am not very good

822.72 --> 828.0400000000001
on average

824.32 --> 828.0400000000001
turned me into a hermit

828.079 --> 833.12
and so yeah i've trouble with sizing all

830.959 --> 835.5189999999999
that up but it's re it's been really

833.12 --> 840.199
helpful understanding it

835.519 --> 840.199
like getting to know that system

852.399 --> 856.72
because there is something magical about

855.04 --> 860.639
it right because

856.72 --> 863.44
whatever position you have or you attain

860.639 --> 866.0
it's where all the automated

863.44 --> 868.24
responses from people come

866.0 --> 871.199
right which to me

868.24 --> 873.519
is like magic

871.199 --> 876.24
it's like somebody is just

873.519 --> 878.88
in a certain ways radiating he you feel

876.24 --> 882.24
it about him and then people just start

878.88 --> 884.8
to respond very specifically

882.24 --> 886.399
they become super cooperative or super

884.8 --> 888.24
obstructive

886.399 --> 890.399
based on the radiance and i've

888.24 --> 891.92
experienced that myself in different

890.399 --> 894.32
types of moods that i have because

891.92 --> 896.959
people respond very differently

894.32 --> 899.839
to me based on what i'm feeling and

896.959 --> 899.8389999999999
thinking about

900.959 --> 905.5189999999999
as they perceive me it's true it's

904.16 --> 907.68
palpable

905.519 --> 910.24
when i feel really good like

907.68 --> 911.5999999999999
people come up to me

910.24 --> 913.519
they just like

911.6 --> 916.399
ask questions or they

913.519 --> 918.5600000000001
they want to say something nice

916.399 --> 920.8
like about the weather or something and

918.56 --> 923.4399999999999
i have that tendency too when i feel

920.8 --> 924.88
really good so i've noticed it in my

923.44 --> 927.7600000000001
personal

924.88 --> 929.92
radiance that other people have

927.76 --> 932.0
different responses it just happens

929.92 --> 934.399
automatically they don't think about

932.0 --> 937.199
that it just happens

934.399 --> 940.56
and the social sexual hierarchy system

937.199 --> 942.24
the gammas etc

940.56 --> 944.959
lies all

942.24 --> 947.839
mostly i think in the automated

944.959 --> 948.959
responses of people which again to me is

947.839 --> 951.44
like

948.959 --> 954.8
magic it's like i don't under

951.44 --> 957.12
it seems to work i don't understand how

954.8 --> 959.12
how people just

957.12 --> 960.5600000000001
automatically

959.12 --> 963.04
adapt

960.56 --> 965.04
even though they often don't even have

963.04 --> 968.24
like the intelligence to understand

965.04 --> 970.639
what's going on and they still just

968.24 --> 970.639
do it

973.279 --> 978.079
all right so it's an interesting system

975.36 --> 980.24
and yeah of course you end up

978.079 --> 984.3199999999999
calling trolls gammas a lot because

980.24 --> 984.32
that's often where they're at

987.04 --> 989.36
right

992.399 --> 996.399
but yeah a gamma

994.56 --> 997.5189999999999
somebody that's really stuck in the

996.399 --> 1001.04
gamma

997.519 --> 1001.04
because you can't be stuck in it

1002.32 --> 1005.9200000000001
like all the

1003.92 --> 1008.0
all the systems of

1005.92 --> 1010.56
social sexual hierarchy

1008.0 --> 1011.839
all are kind of like self

1010.56 --> 1013.3599999999999
sustaining

1011.839 --> 1017.0400000000001
they sustain

1013.36 --> 1019.759
the function that you attain

1017.04 --> 1022.56
when you enter a position so gammas have

1019.759 --> 1025.52
a tendency to stay gamma but they can

1022.56 --> 1028.8799999999999
typically be reformed into deltas which

1025.52 --> 1032.4
is a really interesting effect

1028.88 --> 1034.5590000000002
i myself have had a lot of like back and

1032.4 --> 1036.72
forth between delta and gamma i was

1034.559 --> 1039.199
basically seduced to go to the gamma

1036.72 --> 1042.72
side

1039.199 --> 1044.64
having been foolishly convinced

1042.72 --> 1045.52
that that was

1044.64 --> 1046.64
good

1045.52 --> 1048.959
or

1046.64 --> 1048.959
yeah

1048.96 --> 1054.24
at a young age by really terrible people

1054.799 --> 1059.36
but i've kind of always been a natural

1056.88 --> 1062.3200000000002
delta really in many ways like almost

1059.36 --> 1062.32
robotic like

1063.84 --> 1070.3999999999999
like that's something i feel very

1067.36 --> 1072.4799999999998
comfortable with i feel very comfortable

1070.4 --> 1074.24
like in a group of people

1072.48 --> 1076.16
if they're all really active that i'm

1074.24 --> 1078.4
like a sentinel there

1076.16 --> 1080.799
i'm just i'm not gonna be the center of

1078.4 --> 1082.72
attention but i'm gonna be watching

1080.799 --> 1085.76
and i'm gonna like feel like i'm

1082.72 --> 1085.76
guarding this group

1085.84 --> 1090.9599999999998
not really communicating a lot but i

1087.76 --> 1092.559
will if like if things go astray or

1090.96 --> 1094.88
somebody needs a good idea then i'll

1092.559 --> 1097.039
jump in right

1094.88 --> 1100.5590000000002
and i feel that that's very delta it

1097.039 --> 1102.4
could also be beta

1100.559 --> 1106.039
because it is really a support function

1102.4 --> 1106.039
it's tough to tell

1114.48 --> 1120.84
right and even like in groups like

1117.12 --> 1124.0
there's a big group i don't like group

1120.84 --> 1125.84
talking so if there's a group

1124.0 --> 1127.12
and they're all blabbering and blaring

1125.84 --> 1128.72
about a whole bunch of things and

1127.12 --> 1131.36
laughing and [ __ ]

1128.72 --> 1133.44
then i might like for some reason be

1131.36 --> 1135.4399999999998
able to start a conversation but it's

1133.44 --> 1136.88
never going to be a group conversation

1135.44 --> 1139.039
it's almost like

1136.88 --> 1140.7990000000002
i want to isolate somebody and then have

1139.039 --> 1142.48
a really good one-on-one talk because

1140.799 --> 1145.12
that's

1142.48 --> 1147.679
how mostly i communicate that's how i do

1145.12 --> 1147.6789999999999
it the best

1147.84 --> 1151.799
so it's weird

1152.72 --> 1156.4
it's weird how it work in social

1154.559 --> 1160.24
dynamics

1156.4 --> 1160.24
is the beta a [ __ ] no

1162.0 --> 1167.36
now beta is is the second in command

1173.52 --> 1179.44
yeah an alpha

1176.16 --> 1181.1200000000001
is a very difficult like neutral born

1179.44 --> 1183.679
leader type with all the traits that

1181.12 --> 1183.6789999999999
come with it

1186.4 --> 1192.24
right like for example i don't know if

1189.28 --> 1194.559
i'm getting this right

1192.24 --> 1197.36
but you could for example apply to star

1194.559 --> 1200.08
trek the original series right now

1197.36 --> 1202.08
captain kirk is blatantly and this is

1200.08 --> 1204.559
even carried on in the traditional

1202.08 --> 1206.08
remakes and all that he is it is an

1204.559 --> 1208.8799999999999
alpha

1206.08 --> 1210.3999999999999
he's he's like doing it he got the

1208.88 --> 1212.0
spirit

1210.4 --> 1213.6000000000001
and he's like

1212.0 --> 1216.0
very sexual

1213.6 --> 1216.0
a lot

1216.799 --> 1223.36
that's super alpha right but what would

1219.52 --> 1223.36
be a good beta to that alpha

1227.679 --> 1230.5590000000002
like would

1228.96 --> 1232.08
spark be a good

1230.559 --> 1234.6399999999999
beta

1232.08 --> 1235.6789999999999
and he is [ __ ] is more of a natural

1234.64 --> 1237.919
delta

1235.679 --> 1240.5590000000002
he is kind of like a robot and he's just

1237.919 --> 1242.5590000000002
always supporting

1240.559 --> 1244.3999999999999
right it's like yeah the whole vulcan

1242.559 --> 1247.28
stick

1244.4 --> 1248.88
but he's more of a delta so

1247.28 --> 1251.84
it's weird

1248.88 --> 1254.96
what are the other characters

1251.84 --> 1257.76
like a beta is somebody

1254.96 --> 1259.76
that's like really loyal usually to the

1257.76 --> 1262.559
alpha and then if something happens to

1259.76 --> 1264.32
the alpha then the beta takes over

1262.559 --> 1266.1589999999999
and really tries to fall in their

1264.32 --> 1268.32
footsteps

1266.159 --> 1270.24
not but not because they want to take

1268.32 --> 1272.3999999999999
over because they want the power no but

1270.24 --> 1275.1200000000001
because they feel they have to

1272.4 --> 1278.64
right but there's not a lot of that in

1275.12 --> 1280.9599999999998
the star trek the original series now in

1278.64 --> 1282.64
the next generation for example a really

1280.96 --> 1284.0
typical beta

1282.64 --> 1285.3600000000001
would be

1284.0 --> 1287.36
number one

1285.36 --> 1291.6399999999999
riker

1287.36 --> 1291.6399999999999
like he is a real beta

1292.24 --> 1297.039
right you know he can lead he's like

1294.96 --> 1299.52
almost like you get a bit of a kick when

1297.039 --> 1301.84
he he takes the leading position but he

1299.52 --> 1304.24
doesn't seek it out

1301.84 --> 1306.559
and he's always like supporting the

1304.24 --> 1308.24
authority of the the one in control the

1306.559 --> 1310.96
the alpha which is typically what a

1308.24 --> 1313.1200000000001
number one does

1310.96 --> 1315.44
first officer

1313.12 --> 1315.4399999999998
right

1316.84 --> 1322.0
scotty well scotty

1320.0 --> 1325.52
is an engineer

1322.0 --> 1328.64
right that's what he is and he is

1325.52 --> 1328.6399999999999
kind of like a delta

1331.52 --> 1335.12
like most

1333.2 --> 1339.6000000000001
most people in star trek the original

1335.12 --> 1339.6
series were presented as deltas

1344.88 --> 1348.72
right there's nobody there like on the

1347.12 --> 1351.9189999999999
bridge that's like

1348.72 --> 1354.48
like oh the kirk man i wanna

1351.919 --> 1356.24
i wanna take over or

1354.48 --> 1359.3600000000001
there's no like second guy that you're

1356.24 --> 1362.48
like yeah well there is captain kirk the

1359.36 --> 1364.7199999999998
legend but we got a second one if

1362.48 --> 1366.159
something would happen to him right like

1364.72 --> 1367.44
you would have in star trek next

1366.159 --> 1370.0800000000002
generation

1367.44 --> 1372.48
with riker

1370.08 --> 1375.1999999999998
who's absolutely qualified to like take

1372.48 --> 1377.76
leadership position he has the charisma

1375.2 --> 1377.76
etc

1379.679 --> 1384.6000000000001
but he is a beta i think

1398.48 --> 1402.2
spiral dynamics

1404.799 --> 1407.2
okay

1412.08 --> 1418.48
a much more revealing system well the

1414.559 --> 1420.72
thing about the whole alpha beta delta

1418.48 --> 1423.3600000000001
gamma classification is that it

1420.72 --> 1423.3600000000001
typically

1423.44 --> 1430.799
it isolates

1425.44 --> 1433.3600000000001
roles it isolates the social roles

1430.799 --> 1437.44
and that makes it really useful

1433.36 --> 1439.84
and easy to remember and figure out like

1437.44 --> 1441.8400000000001
technically the social sexual hierarchy

1439.84 --> 1443.12
system

1441.84 --> 1445.1999999999998
from fox

1443.12 --> 1448.0
day is pretty

1445.2 --> 1450.0800000000002
easy for use

1448.0 --> 1452.48
right it's easy to catch on you don't

1450.08 --> 1454.72
have to be a genius to like figure it

1452.48 --> 1454.72
out

1454.96 --> 1459.919
like how it works i mean you probably

1457.84 --> 1462.24
had to be a bit of a genius to actually

1459.919 --> 1464.88
figure out the very system and define it

1462.24 --> 1464.88
like he has

1465.2 --> 1470.72
with such detail

1468.159 --> 1473.6000000000001
but to actually use it you don't have to

1470.72 --> 1476.48
be a genius and that's why it's

1473.6 --> 1476.48
it's a good tool

1478.159 --> 1483.0390000000002
check out that link what link i haven't

1480.72 --> 1484.48
seen a link rig back if you want to link

1483.039 --> 1487.48
me up to that

1484.48 --> 1487.48
sure

1498.96 --> 1501.96
oh

1533.52 --> 1537.08
ah okay

1546.72 --> 1550.559
okay i'm going to check that out thanks

1552.96 --> 1557.799
oh it's a color chart what

1567.039 --> 1572.32
what

1568.64 --> 1572.3200000000002
is this really a good system

1582.32 --> 1585.32
what

1590.08 --> 1595.4399999999998
i i

1591.6 --> 1599.08
don't understand that charge at all

1595.44 --> 1599.0800000000002
it's weird

1604.159 --> 1607.1200000000001
thanks for sharing though

1605.76 --> 1608.64
i might take a

1607.12 --> 1610.8799999999999
more

1608.64 --> 1614.0800000000002
more careful look

1610.88 --> 1617.4
once i feel a little bit

1614.08 --> 1617.3999999999999
more restored

1647.12 --> 1649.4399999999998
hmm

1649.679 --> 1653.3600000000001
all right that sounds interesting

1651.039 --> 1656.1589999999999
borders boy

1653.36 --> 1660.0
i didn't know that

1656.159 --> 1664.48
animals wolves actually applied tactics

1660.0 --> 1664.48
to such detail that's that's fascinating

1666.96 --> 1670.64
is there a working flat earth map

1669.279 --> 1673.2
yeah

1670.64 --> 1673.2
lots of them

1676.48 --> 1680.0
i mean all maps are technically flat

1678.799 --> 1683.2
earth maps

1680.0 --> 1685.039
they're all flat the earth is flat

1683.2 --> 1688.32
they're flat earth maps

1685.039 --> 1690.72
and they happen to be flat as well

1688.32 --> 1692.559
right sure it's a projection but we know

1690.72 --> 1695.039
the earth is flat so that doesn't really

1692.559 --> 1697.6789999999999
matter that's not the scale because at

1695.039 --> 1700.679
least just like the earth's surface it's

1697.679 --> 1700.679
flat

1713.33 --> 1716.6599999999999
[Music]

1732.799 --> 1736.6399999999999
yeah and it's always when they say it

1735.36 --> 1739.6789999999999
you know

1736.64 --> 1741.44
a working map

1739.679 --> 1743.3600000000001
yeah

1741.44 --> 1745.52
every map

1743.36 --> 1749.84
right that's what a map is made for so

1745.52 --> 1749.84
you can orientate and find things

1751.84 --> 1758.32
so yeah works fine right doesn't have to

1754.24 --> 1761.279
be this scale but it works as a map

1758.32 --> 1763.76
it's flat the earth is flat you use the

1761.279 --> 1765.919
map it works

1763.76 --> 1768.64
so yeah working flat earth maps

1765.919 --> 1768.64
absolutely

1778.799 --> 1782.08
what ares 106.

1790.88 --> 1793.88
weird

1797.279 --> 1801.84
scientists of what was it like

1799.76 --> 1803.679
astrophysicist [ __ ]

1801.84 --> 1806.6789999999999
or something there's a lot of those

1803.679 --> 1806.679
commercials

1830.24 --> 1834.84
it was talking about scientists in

1832.72 --> 1838.08
general that makes no

1834.84 --> 1840.799
sense who made that commercial

1838.08 --> 1842.1589999999999
it's a commercial who made it

1840.799 --> 1843.84
that's weird

1842.159 --> 1847.0390000000002
you can just

1843.84 --> 1848.559
who's like who would pay

1847.039 --> 1851.52
for an ad

1848.559 --> 1853.6789999999999
that's just for scientists in general

1851.52 --> 1857.08
that makes no sense that's really weird

1853.679 --> 1857.0800000000002
aries 106.

1882.32 --> 1887.9189999999999
okay was so bad

1885.76 --> 1889.919
right i don't blame you

1887.919 --> 1892.72
but still

1889.919 --> 1896.48
if i'm correct you should still in the

1892.72 --> 1898.559
corner of your browser screen see

1896.48 --> 1900.96
like what ad you actually had been

1898.559 --> 1900.96
playing

1901.12 --> 1907.36
a lot of the time it still shows that in

1903.44 --> 1908.3990000000001
the corner i don't know

1907.36 --> 1910.7199999999998
whatever

1908.399 --> 1910.7199999999998
weird

1911.279 --> 1915.2
what did you miss hello lydia logs

1915.76 --> 1920.039
yeah i didn't much miss much

1947.44 --> 1952.159
yeah

1949.12 --> 1954.799
government okay the sources oh my god

1952.159 --> 1954.7990000000002
that's you all

1955.6 --> 1958.799
terrible

1956.799 --> 1960.8799999999999
oh i'm gonna put on the sweater again

1958.799 --> 1963.84
this is getting

1960.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
a bit chilly here

1983.919 --> 1986.919
huh

2034.0 --> 2038.399
not sure what uppercut was getting at

2036.159 --> 2041.6000000000001
come on the dialogue you know

2038.399 --> 2043.84
it's just being triggered

2041.6 --> 2047.039
right because

2043.84 --> 2049.04
yeah elegy kind of rolled out like a

2047.039 --> 2052.159
typical stupid

2049.04 --> 2052.159
bald heart comment

2052.32 --> 2055.28
like

2053.52 --> 2057.599
one of those things you'd see sean

2055.28 --> 2060.0
hawkins do

2057.599 --> 2061.9190000000003
right so yes it's not strange that

2060.0 --> 2065.2
you're then gonna have somebody that's

2061.919 --> 2069.04
gonna give you a response like that

2065.2 --> 2069.04
like i chose not to do that

2069.44 --> 2072.879
but yeah that doesn't mean that somebody

2071.52 --> 2075.839
that's watching

2072.879 --> 2075.839
isn't going to do that

2079.2 --> 2084.56
oh thank you lumpy gas in the vacuum i

2081.839 --> 2084.56
do my best

2084.72 --> 2091.52
bright and decent

2088.72 --> 2091.52
i do my best

2094.56 --> 2097.359
i appreciate the moral support i really

2096.639 --> 2099.76
do

2097.359 --> 2101.52
like because sometimes i don't

2099.76 --> 2103.599
i feel like

2101.52 --> 2106.24
yeah i have a lot of inner turmoil i got

2103.599 --> 2108.0
a freaking dark world [ __ ]

2106.24 --> 2109.5989999999997
right some of which are literally

2108.0 --> 2111.119
experiences that have never happened

2109.599 --> 2112.88
that haunt me

2111.119 --> 2114.56
because they're constantly convincing me

2112.88 --> 2116.1600000000003
that they did actually happen it's

2114.56 --> 2117.7599999999998
really

2116.16 --> 2120.0
distracting

2117.76 --> 2122.7200000000003
and unnerving at times and it's like

2120.0 --> 2124.88
really nice to actually hear somebody by

2122.72 --> 2125.9199999999996
their own volition just say things like

2124.88 --> 2127.92
that

2125.92 --> 2130.32
because sometimes i feel like i'm

2127.92 --> 2132.2400000000002
despite having a show i feel like i'm

2130.32 --> 2136.0
completely cut off from the world and

2132.24 --> 2136.0
that actually nobody

2136.079 --> 2141.52
is even seeing me

2138.96 --> 2144.56
it's like sometimes i'm doing this show

2141.52 --> 2147.28
and people in chat right and then still

2144.56 --> 2149.44
i get the feeling like

2147.28 --> 2153.2000000000003
like there's nobody there

2149.44 --> 2153.2000000000003
like i'm still on my own it's weird

2154.079 --> 2159.52
luckily yeah i don't have that often

2156.16 --> 2161.92
anymore i used to a lot more

2159.52 --> 2164.0
i just feel like

2161.92 --> 2166.0
like are when you're fooling yourself

2164.0 --> 2168.88
nobody's actually watching those are

2166.0 --> 2172.16
just bots sent to you

2168.88 --> 2175.359
to like comfort you in this thing you

2172.16 --> 2177.359
want to do that's completely useless

2175.359 --> 2180.4
right it's like you're just being

2177.359 --> 2183.839
encapsulated that's yeah it's paranoia

2180.4 --> 2183.839
it is paranoia in a way

2184.8 --> 2188.7200000000003
so yeah when somebody then just says

2186.88 --> 2190.88
something really nice like that

2188.72 --> 2194.3999999999996
heartfelt by their own volition it that

2190.88 --> 2196.2400000000002
really does a lot of good to me

2194.4 --> 2198.48
i was always like that even as a little

2196.24 --> 2198.4799999999996
kid

2198.839 --> 2203.359
like

2200.48 --> 2204.88
if my mother just didn't sometimes like

2203.359 --> 2206.56
genuinely

2204.88 --> 2208.96
compliment me

2206.56 --> 2210.24
then i'd become really miserable and

2208.96 --> 2212.48
haunted

2210.24 --> 2215.359
after a while so they

2212.48 --> 2218.04
she knew that to figure that out and

2215.359 --> 2221.52
that's why she was always basically

2218.04 --> 2224.32
complementary and analysis

2221.52 --> 2226.24
right that's that's it complementary

2224.32 --> 2227.76
analysis

2226.24 --> 2230.3999999999996
analyze me

2227.76 --> 2231.92
and compliment me like oh you've grown

2230.4 --> 2234.56
in this you're grown in that and that's

2231.92 --> 2237.119
like oh my god if i'm if i actually

2234.56 --> 2238.48
succeeded if i actually done it what i'm

2237.119 --> 2240.4
supposed to do

2238.48 --> 2242.96
that's what that

2240.4 --> 2247.2000000000003
influences me with

2242.96 --> 2250.96
right sensitive to that and i don't like

2247.2 --> 2253.1189999999997
being mocked in the same fashion

2250.96 --> 2254.839
so anyway i don't know why i had to make

2253.119 --> 2256.4
that all

2254.839 --> 2259.119
personal

2256.4 --> 2261.44
but thank you

2259.119 --> 2262.32
again

2261.44 --> 2264.32
hello

2262.32 --> 2265.52
steamy traveler you're real i know

2264.32 --> 2268.079
you're real

2265.52 --> 2271.32
you're not a robot that's what a robot

2268.079 --> 2271.32
would say

2289.2 --> 2295.04
self-doubt rather than paranoia yes

2293.28 --> 2297.44
but the problem is is that the

2295.04 --> 2299.839
self-doubt

2297.44 --> 2302.079
is like the first note

2299.839 --> 2303.92
and if you then believe that in the

2302.079 --> 2306.4
moment then it kind of turns the

2303.92 --> 2310.079
paranoia and then suddenly things become

2306.4 --> 2310.079
unnecessarily suspicious

2310.16 --> 2313.2
right

2311.599 --> 2315.839
where you're literally where you could

2313.2 --> 2318.3199999999997
be surrounded by friends like people

2315.839 --> 2320.0789999999997
that are like really friends

2318.32 --> 2322.079
and then something weird happens you

2320.079 --> 2324.5600000000004
can't place it and suddenly you get the

2322.079 --> 2326.88
feeling like they're all

2324.56 --> 2328.7999999999997
they just want to [ __ ] you over

2326.88 --> 2331.44
that they weren't actually your friends

2328.8 --> 2333.28
they were just making you comfortable

2331.44 --> 2334.96
and dependent

2333.28 --> 2337.0400000000004
and that they actually want to [ __ ] with

2334.96 --> 2341.04
you yeah

2337.04 --> 2342.16
that's practically happened in my life

2341.04 --> 2344.16
is

2342.16 --> 2346.0
and that's that's devastating to

2344.16 --> 2348.7999999999997
actually

2346.0 --> 2348.8
roll into that

2349.839 --> 2353.44
so i still have

2351.52 --> 2356.16
a little bit of fear right so for

2353.44 --> 2358.48
example when 10th man decides he doesn't

2356.16 --> 2360.7999999999997
want to hear me talk and just rumpuses

2358.48 --> 2363.599
over me over at the flat earth debates

2360.8 --> 2366.0
i get really hurt

2363.599 --> 2370.1600000000003
and everybody's like come on marwyn come

2366.0 --> 2372.4
on it's like no because this

2370.16 --> 2372.3999999999996
like

2372.8 --> 2378.0
like disrespect

2375.119 --> 2380.839
and just humiliation like no it's not

2378.0 --> 2384.72
important what you got to say

2380.839 --> 2386.96
like that is like the first step into

2384.72 --> 2389.839
that process where you basically become

2386.96 --> 2392.96
a slave to a group

2389.839 --> 2397.16
and it's happened to me

2392.96 --> 2397.16
yeah and it's devastating

2406.0 --> 2412.8
so that's part of the reason why i am

2408.72 --> 2412.7999999999997
kind of defensive at times

2413.28 --> 2418.1600000000003
in social scenarios because of things

2415.52 --> 2419.839
that happened in my past

2418.16 --> 2424.839
or i would

2419.839 --> 2424.839
like enslave myself to other people

2425.2 --> 2429.2
to groups

2427.04 --> 2431.599
because i just wanted to fit in i just

2429.2 --> 2432.72
wanted like a safe spot

2431.599 --> 2434.319
like

2432.72 --> 2435.9199999999996
i wanted to be part of the group

2434.319 --> 2436.88
dynamics

2435.92 --> 2438.8
but

2436.88 --> 2440.7200000000003
it wasn't never really meant to be

2438.8 --> 2443.44
because the group dynamics can never

2440.72 --> 2447.7599999999998
adapt to actually my level

2443.44 --> 2447.76
and i become too wild

2448.16 --> 2452.359
it infuses me too much

2452.96 --> 2458.16
and then usually in a group i would end

2456.0 --> 2458.16
up

2460.4 --> 2464.0
like broken and

2462.48 --> 2466.079
enslaved

2464.0 --> 2468.319
by the other guys the other people's

2466.079 --> 2468.319
will

2468.8 --> 2474.2400000000002
and i would be all doughy-eyed about it

2471.76 --> 2477.0400000000004
it's terrible i hate it i hate that that

2474.24 --> 2477.04
happened with me

2479.2 --> 2482.96
and i have definitely

2483.359 --> 2487.92
cut off that process by basically

2485.76 --> 2490.1600000000003
becoming a freaking hermit

2487.92 --> 2492.4
yeah

2490.16 --> 2494.64
you you could almost say i've become a

2492.4 --> 2497.359
hermit just to prevent

2494.64 --> 2499.44
that effect in my life and my social

2497.359 --> 2503.0
life from getting worse which it was it

2499.44 --> 2503.0
was getting worse

2513.92 --> 2518.7200000000003
right and this is by the way all way

2516.079 --> 2521.44
before like actual

2518.72 --> 2523.359
trolls internet trolls or internet in

2521.44 --> 2525.04
general this was all

2523.359 --> 2527.119
in face-to-face

2525.04 --> 2529.2
reality

2527.119 --> 2531.2000000000003
the internet is is a different type of

2529.2 --> 2534.5989999999997
game it's the same game but it's very

2531.2 --> 2534.5989999999997
different though

2543.839 --> 2550.359
right

2546.079 --> 2550.3590000000004
yeah socially avoidant now

2552.64 --> 2558.24
it's safer that way right

2555.76 --> 2560.8
but it is also because of

2558.24 --> 2563.839
just abuse of other people that are

2560.8 --> 2566.2400000000002
willing to use your loyalty

2563.839 --> 2569.04
abuse it

2566.24 --> 2571.7599999999998
right and that's also why

2569.04 --> 2571.7599999999998
i always

2573.2 --> 2577.2799999999997
take great care of it

2575.44 --> 2580.16
right never to

2577.28 --> 2582.0
abuse somebody's loyalty ever

2580.16 --> 2585.04
like no matter what

2582.0 --> 2588.319
never because it's

2585.04 --> 2588.319
very sensitive to me

2588.48 --> 2592.56
now because of past experience of what i

2591.2 --> 2594.48
went through

2592.56 --> 2598.48
like i

2594.48 --> 2601.839
i was like devastated by that

2598.48 --> 2604.64
devastated like crying in your bed at

2601.839 --> 2606.48
night devastated over that sort of thing

2604.64 --> 2608.56
and that's why i never

2606.48 --> 2611.28
i never want anybody

2608.56 --> 2612.88
to experience anything like that that

2611.28 --> 2616.599
which i went through

2612.88 --> 2616.599
as a kid a lot

2627.839 --> 2630.839
ah

2636.24 --> 2641.4399999999996
we got some ballers rolling in it seems

2639.68 --> 2645.0
they seem a lot more comfortable these

2641.44 --> 2645.0
days in my chat

2666.4 --> 2671.28
why go to oakley channel to be abused

2673.52 --> 2678.72
don't really get abused but there are

2677.359 --> 2681.68
moments

2678.72 --> 2684.3999999999996
when suddenly there is like this weird

2681.68 --> 2684.3999999999996
mismatch

2688.56 --> 2694.4
sometimes the guys have trouble with

2690.88 --> 2695.52
well my mood swings it happens

2694.4 --> 2698.88
i'm very

2695.52 --> 2700.96
fluid type of guy when it comes to mood

2698.88 --> 2705.44
not volatile

2700.96 --> 2709.119
but some days i'm just like

2705.44 --> 2709.119
more easily agitated or

2709.68 --> 2713.5989999999997
yeah

2711.599 --> 2714.7200000000003
and often they don't really know how to

2713.599 --> 2716.96
deal with that

2714.72 --> 2719.2
they just don't understand it

2716.96 --> 2721.68
then they're like what or when why are

2719.2 --> 2724.56
you so triggered

2721.68 --> 2726.96
and they apparently don't realize oh

2724.56 --> 2729.119
yeah he's really so triggered i can feel

2726.96 --> 2730.16
it in his voice oh

2729.119 --> 2732.4
okay

2730.16 --> 2734.48
we need to give him some room

2732.4 --> 2736.64
because that's exactly what it is

2734.48 --> 2738.72
and often they just don't they don't see

2736.64 --> 2740.8799999999997
it

2738.72 --> 2744.319
but they don't really do it on purp they

2740.88 --> 2746.2400000000002
do kind of try to like oh come on

2744.319 --> 2748.24
but it doesn't work like that they don't

2746.24 --> 2750.24
understand it

2748.24 --> 2753.7599999999998
and they don't think they're like

2750.24 --> 2755.04
kind of like putting me in my place

2753.76 --> 2756.4
on purpose

2755.04 --> 2760.2799999999997
it's just that they don't really know

2756.4 --> 2760.28
how to deal with me sometimes

2761.359 --> 2766.72
and yeah everybody there has their own

2763.68 --> 2766.72
different types of moods

2770.72 --> 2778.0789999999997
but no i'm not being abused i don't know

2774.319 --> 2778.079
why you'd even say that like

2780.72 --> 2786.56
i mean i i get basically a baller royale

2785.04 --> 2790.24
seat

2786.56 --> 2790.24
at the table at the main table

2798.079 --> 2802.6800000000003
take it easy there lumpy gas in the

2799.68 --> 2802.68
vacuum

2803.359 --> 2807.56
that sounds kind of gay

2820.56 --> 2825.359
realist

2822.48 --> 2828.68
oh he thinks he's a baller realist

2825.359 --> 2828.68
that's hilarious

2840.64 --> 2844.319
i think that

2841.839 --> 2846.0789999999997
you probably yeah i could get into the

2844.319 --> 2848.88
detail of that

2846.079 --> 2851.2000000000003
it's a realist no maybe a pragmatist

2848.88 --> 2853.76
right it's pragmatic believing in the

2851.2 --> 2855.359
ball because there's so much of it so

2853.76 --> 2858.3190000000004
many people believe it yeah you could be

2855.359 --> 2860.64
a pragmatist and just say like nah i'm

2858.319 --> 2862.0
just gonna go with the ball i know so

2860.64 --> 2862.8799999999997
much about it

2862.0 --> 2864.559
right

2862.88 --> 2866.96
people get that

2864.559 --> 2869.52
i get some respect for that i get that

2866.96 --> 2871.52
that's just like yeah pragmatic

2869.52 --> 2874.079
realists

2871.52 --> 2874.079
no

2874.559 --> 2877.599
quite the opposite

2879.359 --> 2883.92
why can't we sin

2881.28 --> 2888.3190000000004
why can't we seen

2883.92 --> 2888.319
the sun's light at night

2888.96 --> 2893.04
that's really

2890.88 --> 2894.8
really broken english but

2893.04 --> 2897.359
yeah why can't we see it because it's

2894.8 --> 2897.3590000000004
not there

2897.92 --> 2904.7200000000003
it's not shining on the other side

2901.839 --> 2904.72
of the earth

2906.0 --> 2910.24
it's just not there

2908.319 --> 2912.4
yeah it's holographic do i have to do

2910.24 --> 2914.7999999999997
that all over again i had

2912.4 --> 2917.04
yesterday's half is the show was about

2914.8 --> 2917.04
that

2922.8 --> 2925.92
it's not a

2924.559 --> 2929.44
light bulb

2925.92 --> 2933.599
floating over a disk

2929.44 --> 2933.599
it's not an object it's a hologram

2934.96 --> 2939.44
where has the sun gone

2937.04 --> 2942.319
it's not there

2939.44 --> 2943.52
if it's night it isn't there there is no

2942.319 --> 2947.48
sun there

2943.52 --> 2947.48
there is no manifestation

2947.76 --> 2952.559
it shines in australia when it's not yet

2950.48 --> 2954.8
i know

2952.559 --> 2957.0400000000004
it shines in australia but it's not

2954.8 --> 2960.4
shining in europe

2957.04 --> 2963.599
because it's not there during that time

2960.4 --> 2963.599
what we call the night time

2964.079 --> 2969.44
it's not an object in a location shining

2966.96 --> 2969.44
over you

2969.52 --> 2974.72
it's a hologram at an apparent an

2972.72 --> 2976.3999999999996
apparent distance

2974.72 --> 2979.04
forming an arc

2976.4 --> 2982.88
within your line of sight

2979.04 --> 2982.88
and when it's not there anymore

2983.04 --> 2990.5589999999997
because sun has gone under

2987.04 --> 2992.88
then there is no sun there

2990.559 --> 2994.96
there is no sun

2992.88 --> 2996.2400000000002
if you don't see it anymore it doesn't

2994.96 --> 2999.839
exist

2996.24 --> 2999.839
because it's just a hologram

3000.24 --> 3005.4399999999996
a light emanating hologram a whole [ __ ]

3002.96 --> 3009.0
on a light emanates

3005.44 --> 3009.0
but it is a hologram

3013.119 --> 3018.559
when did it start being project what

3015.28 --> 3018.559
kind of a question is that

3023.92 --> 3029.76
pretty sure that it started functioning

3026.8 --> 3029.76
when it was designed

3032.319 --> 3034.5589999999997
right

3036.559 --> 3040.1600000000003
when the realm was designed that's where

3038.24 --> 3044.8799999999997
the sun was put in place there's a very

3040.16 --> 3044.8799999999997
rough description of this in genesis

3051.76 --> 3059.2000000000003
who made the hologram god

3055.599 --> 3059.2000000000003
the designer of this realm

3059.359 --> 3064.4
one that's arranged the physical

3061.44 --> 3064.4
manifestation

3066.0 --> 3069.839
right that's created this

3071.119 --> 3078.559
this simulatory setup for us all

3075.04 --> 3081.119
it contains a holographic system

3078.559 --> 3082.4
which is classified celestial

3081.119 --> 3084.7200000000003
all the celestial lights are all

3082.4 --> 3086.96
holographic it's a part of the realm it

3084.72 --> 3088.72
is there as soon as the realm

3086.96 --> 3090.16
was manifested

3088.72 --> 3092.0789999999997
it came

3090.16 --> 3095.0789999999997
it was put there it's described in

3092.079 --> 3095.079
genesis

3096.16 --> 3101.44
why are you sorting christian because

3098.4 --> 3103.28
it's the only reference that exists

3101.44 --> 3106.0
moral code

3103.28 --> 3108.48
and there is no science that you can

3106.0 --> 3108.48
reference

3109.359 --> 3114.319
it's not there it doesn't apply science

3111.76 --> 3117.44
doesn't apply

3114.319 --> 3120.24
we can't very manipulate it

3117.44 --> 3124.599
can't test it

3120.24 --> 3124.5989999999997
we can only observe it

3126.0 --> 3130.079
how does this hologram emit heat

3132.559 --> 3136.079
how does a hologram

3134.72 --> 3138.0
emit light

3136.079 --> 3141.04
it's the same way it's not it's not

3138.0 --> 3143.76
radiation heat anyway right you don't go

3141.04 --> 3145.839
why don't you go move towards that sun

3143.76 --> 3148.6400000000003
right wherever you think it is

3145.839 --> 3151.2799999999997
and then watch the intensity

3148.64 --> 3152.64
of the light increase as you approach it

3151.28 --> 3156.3190000000004
right

3152.64 --> 3158.48
like supposedly even the atmosphere is

3156.319 --> 3160.5589999999997
absorbing it all

3158.48 --> 3164.559
so if you just go up higher you should

3160.559 --> 3164.559
be having more light from the sun

3164.8 --> 3169.52
in for square law right i don't think

3166.8 --> 3169.52
that's happening

3169.92 --> 3173.2000000000003
the intensity is pretty consistent

3171.839 --> 3175.52
everywhere

3173.2 --> 3177.4399999999996
maybe it's even more

3175.52 --> 3180.4
when there's more atmosphere which is

3177.44 --> 3181.839
quite a conundrum that's quite

3180.4 --> 3184.88
bizarre

3181.839 --> 3187.839
you can't explain that with regular

3184.88 --> 3187.839
light mechanics

3192.48 --> 3197.2
yeah but you can get a tan from a

3194.559 --> 3197.2000000000003
hologram

3197.359 --> 3204.88
if you input a hologram machine man-made

3202.559 --> 3208.3190000000004
with a light source that provides heat

3204.88 --> 3209.6800000000003
then literally staring at the hologram

3208.319 --> 3213.04
or yeah

3209.68 --> 3213.04
sorry keep saying heat

3213.76 --> 3216.0
some

3216.24 --> 3221.359
damn ultraviolet in there

3218.8 --> 3223.28
in the hologram

3221.359 --> 3226.16
then you can literally look at that

3223.28 --> 3229.119
hologram that is created not the source

3226.16 --> 3232.359
of it but the hologram and get a tan

3229.119 --> 3232.359
from it

3257.44 --> 3260.44
so

3268.16 --> 3272.48
do i cite any other mythologies

3272.64 --> 3276.5589999999997
sure

3274.319 --> 3279.5589999999997
i just know more about christian

3276.559 --> 3279.559
mythology

3281.28 --> 3283.52
right

3284.0 --> 3290.48
but i don't even i don't exclude others

3288.4 --> 3293.04
i'm like

3290.48 --> 3295.599
like bring it on everything

3293.04 --> 3297.839
all of it all of it will have wisdom it

3295.599 --> 3299.28
will have gravels it's up to the

3297.839 --> 3301.359
individual

3299.28 --> 3303.92
with their connection to god to figure

3301.359 --> 3307.7599999999998
out what is real and why things are the

3303.92 --> 3308.64
way they are in each religion

3307.76 --> 3310.48
right

3308.64 --> 3313.5989999999997
so i'm not like this

3310.48 --> 3316.559
christian exclusivist like oh it's

3313.599 --> 3320.7200000000003
christian or it's the devil

3316.559 --> 3323.76
or you yeah or like literal bible things

3320.72 --> 3323.7599999999998
no i'm not like that

3324.319 --> 3328.5589999999997
but i do consider myself a christian

3326.24 --> 3330.799
because

3328.559 --> 3330.799
i

3331.119 --> 3337.119
hold in high

3332.839 --> 3337.119
regard the words of christ

3341.92 --> 3347.88
and yeah his wisdom

3344.559 --> 3347.88
and his predictions

3350.319 --> 3354.96
right but as far as

3352.72 --> 3357.2799999999997
how the earth was created with the

3354.96 --> 3358.96
celestials i really only know the

3357.28 --> 3361.6800000000003
biblical story

3358.96 --> 3363.76
about that genesis

3361.68 --> 3367.1189999999997
and it like genesis has so many

3363.76 --> 3367.119
interesting things in it

3367.28 --> 3371.119
right there might be

3369.04 --> 3373.04
other religions that have similar

3371.119 --> 3377.559
creation stories

3373.04 --> 3377.5589999999997
or slightly different i don't know

3390.559 --> 3393.559
um

3412.079 --> 3415.92
you can't get a tent yeah you can

3414.319 --> 3417.44
[ __ ]

3415.92 --> 3419.52
are you just here to

3417.44 --> 3422.0
screw me over or something

3419.52 --> 3424.559
you can you can get a tan from a

3422.0 --> 3424.559
hologram

3429.52 --> 3433.2
if it's actually light generated i mean

3432.0 --> 3437.119
not like a

3433.2 --> 3437.1189999999997
3d image hologram

3439.04 --> 3445.839
dude if you'd be exposed like enough by

3442.799 --> 3449.04
a basic freaking

3445.839 --> 3449.04
you'd get a hologram

3450.799 --> 3456.0
explain how it's light the light comes

3454.559 --> 3458.079
to you

3456.0 --> 3460.559
it reaches you

3458.079 --> 3462.799
that's why you see it you see something

3460.559 --> 3464.88
it's because the light is reaching you

3462.799 --> 3469.2
if you see a hologram

3464.88 --> 3472.4
that means there is light reaching you

3469.2 --> 3473.5989999999997
yeah and within that spectrum of the the

3472.4 --> 3476.48
light

3473.599 --> 3478.96
there is ultraviolet

3476.48 --> 3482.2400000000002
which gives you a tan

3478.96 --> 3484.96
so if you create a man-made hologram

3482.24 --> 3486.4799999999996
with a light source that includes

3484.96 --> 3489.52
ultraviolet

3486.48 --> 3492.88
then you can literally create a hologram

3489.52 --> 3492.88
that will give you a tan

3493.119 --> 3498.2400000000002
when you face it long enough

3496.4 --> 3502.44
that's just

3498.24 --> 3502.4399999999996
yeah it's just what it is

3504.799 --> 3511.599
holograms need light at no they are

3508.24 --> 3514.3999999999996
light holograms are lights hello

3511.599 --> 3515.28
hollow ram

3514.4 --> 3516.4
light

3515.28 --> 3519.6800000000003
holo

3516.4 --> 3522.2400000000002
gram image image of light it's literally

3519.68 --> 3522.24
the word

3527.04 --> 3531.68
the sun is a consequence of daylight no

3529.2 --> 3533.2799999999997
it's not good servant no it's not it's

3531.68 --> 3537.359
different it's

3533.28 --> 3537.3590000000004
specifically announced

3537.52 --> 3542.559
through the freaking bible that it's not

3540.319 --> 3545.839
the same

3542.559 --> 3549.0400000000004
the daylight and the sun are separate

3545.839 --> 3550.48
the sun is illuminary

3549.04 --> 3553.92
the day

3550.48 --> 3556.72
is a separate effect

3553.92 --> 3559.359
it's specifically noted in genesis

3556.72 --> 3560.3999999999996
it's separated they didn't say oh we put

3559.359 --> 3563.119
the

3560.4 --> 3566.1600000000003
like first came the day

3563.119 --> 3568.1600000000003
and the night and that cycle then god

3566.16 --> 3570.799
started started to put luminaries

3568.16 --> 3572.3999999999996
including the sun in there right

3570.799 --> 3575.92
so no

3572.4 --> 3577.44
daylight is not a consequences of the

3575.92 --> 3580.7200000000003
sun

3577.44 --> 3584.96
it's the yeah it's not the order

3580.72 --> 3584.9599999999996
right the order of how it was placed

3585.44 --> 3590.44
it's separate it's a separate effect

3626.24 --> 3630.9599999999996
not good so now but the funny thing is

3628.559 --> 3633.2000000000003
is that science

3630.96 --> 3636.64
the heliocentrist actually claimed that

3633.2 --> 3639.68
the daylight is because of the sun

3636.64 --> 3640.839
that it's the sun illuminating

3639.68 --> 3644.96
the

3640.839 --> 3647.119
atmosphere and that it makes it blue

3644.96 --> 3650.599
that's their claim that's not the

3647.119 --> 3650.599
biblical claim

3660.799 --> 3663.799
so

3674.0 --> 3676.64
but there is no

3675.52 --> 3680.72
physical

3676.64 --> 3684.04
spatial consequences for distance what

3680.72 --> 3684.04
what do you mean

3697.119 --> 3699.839
really

3700.24 --> 3704.0789999999997
oh my god elegy really

3704.4 --> 3707.44
are you serious

3708.24 --> 3713.68
so you're gonna literally misunderstand

3710.72 --> 3715.2799999999997
relative density

3713.68 --> 3719.2799999999997
you think that

3715.28 --> 3723.079
it makes the directions relative that's

3719.28 --> 3723.079
that's really weird

3726.48 --> 3731.119
okay

3728.16 --> 3734.0789999999997
relative density is relative because it

3731.119 --> 3736.4
emphasizes the relation between the

3734.079 --> 3739.039
density of an object and the density of

3736.4 --> 3739.039
the medium

3739.28 --> 3744.559
yeah the directions

3741.599 --> 3744.559
are not relative

3747.92 --> 3755.039
the dense object will always go down

3751.839 --> 3758.24
in relation to the less dense medium

3755.039 --> 3758.96
and the less dense object will always go

3758.24 --> 3761.7599999999998
up

3758.96 --> 3766.68
in relation to the denser medium

3761.76 --> 3766.6800000000003
and that's just how that works always

3768.16 --> 3773.16
it's a don't freaking dude

3784.96 --> 3788.559
yeah

3786.4 --> 3790.1600000000003
of course

3788.559 --> 3794.88
trolly boy

3790.16 --> 3797.839
relative density is a dumb flurf idea

3794.88 --> 3797.839
uh

3807.359 --> 3812.88
it's not an idea it's an observation no

3810.24 --> 3816.9599999999996
it's more than that it's actually a

3812.88 --> 3820.079
scientific hypothesis fact

3816.96 --> 3821.039
yeah it's actually science yeah

3820.079 --> 3822.8390000000004
you know

3821.039 --> 3827.119
that

3822.839 --> 3828.72
thing that that they claim they have and

3827.119 --> 3831.44
then they

3828.72 --> 3833.0389999999998
deny how science proves anything

3831.44 --> 3835.2000000000003
when you actually confront them with

3833.039 --> 3836.0
what the scientific method is

3835.2 --> 3839.2
well

3836.0 --> 3841.76
relative density is actually scientific

3839.2 --> 3844.5589999999997
fact according to the scientific method

3841.76 --> 3847.119
that anybody can perform

3844.559 --> 3850.559
was this whole project

3847.119 --> 3853.599
and it stands true it is effective

3850.559 --> 3857.039
and besides it's not like we invented it

3853.599 --> 3858.6400000000003
we just did the hypothesis

3857.039 --> 3860.96
it worked

3858.64 --> 3863.96
i've modeled it based on those

3860.96 --> 3863.96
experiments

3868.0 --> 3874.24
right but we didn't invent it relative

3870.319 --> 3876.4
density has existed for quite a while

3874.24 --> 3878.0
like i was

3876.4 --> 3881.44
taught about it

3878.0 --> 3884.4
for a very short time even in my school

3881.44 --> 3887.92
and that's like 30 years ago

3884.4 --> 3889.839
right i was taught it in school

3887.92 --> 3892.2400000000002
and i just kind of forgot again because

3889.839 --> 3895.2799999999997
yeah gravity gravity crafty you know

3892.24 --> 3897.5989999999997
that's my mind was imagining a lot

3895.28 --> 3900.1600000000003
so gravity kind of like

3897.599 --> 3902.799
slipped in and just like i forgot about

3900.16 --> 3906.48
relative density for a bit because it

3902.799 --> 3908.64
yeah you can't really find it

3906.48 --> 3910.559
described everywhere so it's just

3908.64 --> 3912.5589999999997
gravity

3910.559 --> 3913.92
right but relative density already

3912.559 --> 3916.559
existed

3913.92 --> 3920.0
before the flat earth

3916.559 --> 3923.3590000000004
movement the flat earth debate and

3920.0 --> 3926.24
sleeping warrior tony started to like do

3923.359 --> 3926.24
the experiments

3928.16 --> 3931.44
hey professor phil bell

3932.559 --> 3937.079
it's twitter

3934.079 --> 3937.079
oh

3938.079 --> 3942.7200000000003
not well thought out dude it's just

3940.48 --> 3946.76
projecting fundy

3942.72 --> 3946.7599999999998
i think i'm gonna ban him

3964.079 --> 3966.559
yes

3967.359 --> 3974.0789999999997
scientists have been studying gravity

3969.839 --> 3974.0789999999997
for hundreds of years really

3975.32 --> 3979.28
[Music]

3977.039 --> 3979.28
oh

3982.799 --> 3988.72
really so elegy

3985.52 --> 3991.119
really scientists have been studying

3988.72 --> 3993.0389999999998
gravity for hundreds of years really so

3991.119 --> 3994.6400000000003
what's their hypothesis

3993.039 --> 3996.96
huh allergy

3994.64 --> 3999.5989999999997
what's their hypothesis

3996.96 --> 4001.839
what's the hypothesis of the scientists

3999.599 --> 4005.48
that have been studying gravity for

4001.839 --> 4005.48
years what's their hypothesis

4007.68 --> 4011.5989999999997
yeah i mean

4009.76 --> 4013.5200000000004
you can't even say

4011.599 --> 4016.48
that you're scientifically studying

4013.52 --> 4019.48
something if you don't have a hypothesis

4016.48 --> 4019.48
so

4020.079 --> 4025.3590000000004
you have any credentials

4022.96 --> 4027.839
the [ __ ] does that have to do with it

4025.359 --> 4030.0789999999997
are we talking about science are we

4027.839 --> 4033.359
talking about

4030.079 --> 4035.039
some catalogue of

4033.359 --> 4038.16
society

4035.039 --> 4039.76
societal trinkets that give you alleged

4038.16 --> 4041.92
authority

4039.76 --> 4045.2000000000003
yeah are we talking about science are we

4041.92 --> 4045.2000000000003
talking about papers

4047.359 --> 4053.2799999999997
yeah what's

4049.44 --> 4055.76
these scientists hypotheses

4053.28 --> 4059.52
that study gravity for hundreds of years

4055.76 --> 4059.5200000000004
what's their hypothesis yeah

4059.76 --> 4064.3190000000004
a proper response isn't do you have any

4062.4 --> 4067.92
scientific credentials that's not a

4064.319 --> 4069.359
proper response to that inquiry

4067.92 --> 4071.44
yeah

4069.359 --> 4074.16
i can inquire

4071.44 --> 4076.48
what is their hypothesis when you in my

4074.16 --> 4078.799
chat say that scientists have studied

4076.48 --> 4081.359
gravity for hundreds of years

4078.799 --> 4086.44
and you should answer that question

4081.359 --> 4086.44
or i probably will ban you

4104.48 --> 4109.3589999999995
how would i use relative density to

4106.719 --> 4109.359
calculate

4109.679 --> 4112.0
well

4115.04 --> 4117.2789999999995
since you're

4116.159 --> 4120.0
if you're gonna

4117.279 --> 4121.839000000001
talk about a projectile right the solid

4120.0 --> 4124.799
object

4121.839 --> 4126.239
i'd say just use the gravity system it's

4124.799 --> 4127.759
easy

4126.239 --> 4130.639999999999
right

4127.759 --> 4133.92
now if you're gonna study

4130.64 --> 4136.56
things that involve air

4133.92 --> 4138.88
right yeah that's when you actually want

4136.56 --> 4141.759
to start applying relative density

4138.88 --> 4144.319
because gravity system don't really work

4141.759 --> 4145.679
with air because it's all newtonian

4144.319 --> 4148.88
mechanisms

4145.679 --> 4150.64
and newton in his gravity model

4148.88 --> 4153.279
which he never claimed the hypothesis

4150.64 --> 4155.279
for officially in writing yeah

4153.279 --> 4157.4400000000005
officially in writing he absolutely

4155.279 --> 4161.040000000001
disclaimed hypothesis he didn't think it

4157.44 --> 4164.879999999999
was scientific it was just a model

4161.04 --> 4167.92
he excluded gas behavior the model is

4164.88 --> 4170.88
incomplete the gravity model doesn't

4167.92 --> 4174.2390000000005
actually account for gas behavior you

4170.88 --> 4177.279
see it's incomplete but if you're gonna

4174.239 --> 4179.839
calculate trajectories of solid objects

4177.279 --> 4181.679
then it works fine

4179.839 --> 4183.679
it's predictable

4181.679 --> 4185.12
enough

4183.679 --> 4187.12
but as soon as you

4185.12 --> 4189.44
have a little bit more complex setup

4187.12 --> 4192.48
that involves gases then you're gonna

4189.44 --> 4195.2789999999995
have a problem because gravity formulas

4192.48 --> 4195.2789999999995
aren't gonna work

4198.48 --> 4202.639999999999
dirty will be useless to me oh well i'm

4201.04 --> 4204.4
so sorry

4202.64 --> 4206.8
so sorry

4204.4 --> 4207.92
sorry i'm actually giving you real

4206.8 --> 4211.92
advice

4207.92 --> 4213.52
to blatant attempts at troll question

4211.92 --> 4217.84
i don't know why i do it anymore i

4213.52 --> 4217.84
should just kick all of you out

4221.04 --> 4226.96
what would prove

4222.88 --> 4226.96
relative density invalid

4228.719 --> 4231.84
if it didn't work

4234.08 --> 4237.04
but

4234.88 --> 4237.92
it always works

4237.04 --> 4239.12
it's

4237.92 --> 4242.32
so

4239.12 --> 4246.0
so reliable actually you could

4242.32 --> 4247.759999999999
actually start yeah gathering it up in a

4246.0 --> 4249.6
natural law

4247.76 --> 4252.159000000001
sector

4249.6 --> 4253.280000000001
because it always works yeah it's just

4252.159 --> 4255.28
not as

4253.28 --> 4257.44
comfy easy

4255.28 --> 4260.4
a couple of numbers a

4257.44 --> 4262.239
certain formula here

4260.4 --> 4264.5599999999995
that you can use with gravity right

4262.239 --> 4266.799999999999
gravity is very easy

4264.56 --> 4268.4800000000005
for use

4266.8 --> 4271.360000000001
it's very basic

4268.48 --> 4274.08
it's not complete

4271.36 --> 4276.48
you see it's not complete it isn't the

4274.08 --> 4278.48
full system

4276.48 --> 4280.159
it's conceptual

4278.48 --> 4282.639999999999
it's a tool

4280.159 --> 4284.799999999999
it's a very handy tool but it isn't

4282.64 --> 4287.679
based on physical reality because

4284.8 --> 4291.679
gravity isn't actually a thing

4287.679 --> 4291.679
mass isn't attracted by mass

4291.84 --> 4296.96
for starters

4294.64 --> 4299.6
and

4296.96 --> 4301.52
it excludes the entire model excludes

4299.6 --> 4305.76
gas behavior

4301.52 --> 4305.76
it requires you to think of gas

4305.84 --> 4310.0
working in a way that it doesn't

4308.32 --> 4312.639999999999
actually work

4310.0 --> 4315.679
like in reality

4312.64 --> 4317.92
it excludes normal gas behavior so yeah

4315.679 --> 4319.92
it might work with solid objects really

4317.92 --> 4322.64
cool you know gravity very easy very

4319.92 --> 4323.92
quickly just a couple of numbers and

4322.64 --> 4327.360000000001
there you go

4323.92 --> 4330.96
really cool really handy really easy

4327.36 --> 4334.239
but it's a model it's a tool it isn't

4330.96 --> 4337.199
actually a real thing

4334.239 --> 4342.28
because it excludes gas behavior gas

4337.199 --> 4342.28
behavior isn't included in gravity

4345.6 --> 4348.6
uh

4364.719 --> 4367.719
so

4377.04 --> 4382.239
no professor phil bill that's [ __ ]

4382.4 --> 4387.28
that you literally pulled that [ __ ] out

4384.64 --> 4387.280000000001
of your ass

4389.679 --> 4392.96
you literally

4391.36 --> 4397.88
made that up

4392.96 --> 4397.88
there is no official claim about that

4404.4 --> 4407.4
so

4423.199 --> 4428.4
oh [ __ ] gosh behavior isn't included in

4425.76 --> 4428.400000000001
gravity

4429.92 --> 4434.88
it isn't

4431.6 --> 4437.52
who has to say it it's not there

4434.88 --> 4438.88
can you point at how gas behavior is

4437.52 --> 4440.400000000001
included

4438.88 --> 4443.12
in gravity

4440.4 --> 4446.4
where it describes how gravity is

4443.12 --> 4448.96
influencing gas that actually

4446.4 --> 4452.879999999999
when you work it out calculate it out it

4448.96 --> 4454.4800000000005
actually works in reality as in actually

4452.88 --> 4458.0
works

4454.48 --> 4458.0
not just fictionally

4461.52 --> 4466.159000000001
atmosphere oh my god okay i'm gonna kick

4464.48 --> 4468.639999999999
you out

4466.159 --> 4471.28
kick i'm done with the [ __ ]

4468.64 --> 4473.280000000001
get the [ __ ] out and you get the [ __ ]

4471.28 --> 4476.5599999999995
out to

4473.28 --> 4476.5599999999995
a bunch of scum

4478.88 --> 4486.92
you get the [ __ ] out too get out

4482.96 --> 4486.92
oh a bunch of scum

4519.44 --> 4524.04
i don't know why i even try anymore

4527.36 --> 4531.5199999999995
i really don't i don't

4529.199 --> 4534.32
because i want to i want to believe that

4531.52 --> 4536.96
even if you're that [ __ ] [ __ ] if

4534.32 --> 4538.639999999999
you're that unbelievably [ __ ]

4536.96 --> 4541.12
[ __ ]

4538.64 --> 4543.1990000000005
that giving an honest

4541.12 --> 4544.88
technically correct answer might

4543.199 --> 4547.28
actually snap them out of it and i

4544.88 --> 4550.84
should just give that up

4547.28 --> 4552.719
because these people are so [ __ ]

4550.84 --> 4555.52
[ __ ]

4552.719 --> 4558.159
no again calling them [ __ ] is a

4555.52 --> 4560.400000000001
disservice to actually [ __ ] people

4558.159 --> 4563.639999999999
this is not [ __ ]

4560.4 --> 4568.639999999999
this is malice this is pure

4563.64 --> 4568.64
psychological malice from these people

4573.84 --> 4576.84
and

4580.239 --> 4583.839999999999
yeah

4581.76 --> 4585.12
there's things i could say about people

4583.84 --> 4587.12
like that

4585.12 --> 4588.88
about what i think their their fate

4587.12 --> 4590.159
should be

4588.88 --> 4591.76
but i'm just not going to do that

4590.159 --> 4595.839999999999
because i

4591.76 --> 4595.84
don't want to ruin my own mood

4612.88 --> 4617.52
yep

4614.0 --> 4619.44
yes lumpy gas in a vacuum

4617.52 --> 4622.88
there yeah my demons that's right

4619.44 --> 4625.36
they're just there to lie

4622.88 --> 4627.4400000000005
but the main target of their lies is

4625.36 --> 4629.839999999999
themselves

4627.44 --> 4631.04
and they will go to any length

4629.84 --> 4633.360000000001
any length

4631.04 --> 4637.679
right they would all they were doing

4633.36 --> 4643.12
here in this chat was reinforcing the

4637.679 --> 4645.1990000000005
most basic dumb disproven [ __ ]

4643.12 --> 4648.0
they were literally just trying to

4645.199 --> 4650.48
reinforce the most fundamental

4648.0 --> 4652.32
delusion base blocks

4650.48 --> 4654.159
like they're not

4652.32 --> 4656.639999999999
they're not interested

4654.159 --> 4660.239
they're not giving an inch they just

4656.64 --> 4661.679
want the [ __ ] [ __ ] lies

4660.239 --> 4664.0
that they've been filled up with in

4661.679 --> 4665.12
their youth they just want them to be

4664.0 --> 4667.6
true

4665.12 --> 4669.36
and they don't care about reality at all

4667.6 --> 4672.8
they don't care to figure out how it

4669.36 --> 4675.44
really works they just want that [ __ ] to

4672.8 --> 4677.360000000001
be true exactly as is

4675.44 --> 4679.678999999999
and they don't care that it doesn't make

4677.36 --> 4685.0
sense

4679.679 --> 4685.0
they just want to reinforce the lies

4693.28 --> 4696.28
ugh

4714.0 --> 4717.0
hmm

4734.88 --> 4740.4800000000005
yeah jd yeah there's some birds singing

4738.08 --> 4740.48
out there

4743.44 --> 4746.879999999999
that's gonna be really good in like a

4745.04 --> 4749.5199999999995
month

4746.88 --> 4752.400000000001
or two months in may it's like really

4749.52 --> 4752.400000000001
crowded out there

4752.56 --> 4757.159000000001
the birds really looking forward to that

4779.76 --> 4782.719
you can get a kelso

4781.44 --> 4786.08
all right

4782.719 --> 4786.08
yeah i got one earlier

4788.159 --> 4791.839999999999
i'm feeling a lot better

4792.239 --> 4796.199
than i did an hour ago

4804.239 --> 4807.239
so

4823.44 --> 4828.48
right yeah

4825.199 --> 4831.44
yeah but lumpy gas in a vacuum it is

4828.48 --> 4833.44
they do have to apply logical fallacy

4831.44 --> 4838.719
because they

4833.44 --> 4838.719
need logical fallacy to be good enough

4838.8 --> 4842.4800000000005
because if they don't get the logical

4840.88 --> 4845.36
fallacies

4842.48 --> 4847.5199999999995
then their entire framework

4845.36 --> 4849.12
everything everything they've built

4847.52 --> 4851.52
virtually in their mind all their

4849.12 --> 4853.44
explanations of how things work it's all

4851.52 --> 4856.320000000001
gonna break up

4853.44 --> 4858.239
it's all gonna just completely

4856.32 --> 4860.639
fall down like a house of cards so they

4858.239 --> 4862.799999999999
need

4860.639 --> 4865.92
they need the glue

4862.8 --> 4867.84
of the acceptance of logical fallacy

4865.92 --> 4870.4
or the house of card will just come

4867.84 --> 4870.400000000001
falling down

4872.4 --> 4874.719
quite

4873.28 --> 4876.8
like where are they going to be if they

4874.719 --> 4880.88
can't presuppose the radius value of

4876.8 --> 4882.400000000001
earth where are they going to be nowhere

4880.88 --> 4885.52
right

4882.4 --> 4887.679
where are they going to be if they don't

4885.52 --> 4890.080000000001
apply

4887.679 --> 4892.0
gravity within their model as if it were

4890.08 --> 4894.88
a force even though officially it isn't

4892.0 --> 4899.6
force right because if they

4894.88 --> 4903.76
didn't accept it as a force

4899.6 --> 4906.88
then they wouldn't have any mechanics

4903.76 --> 4910.56
to balance out and explain how their

4906.88 --> 4913.76
apparent universe mechanics works

4910.56 --> 4916.56
how the solar system is

4913.76 --> 4917.280000000001
because it's still based the modeling

4916.56 --> 4919.76
on

4917.28 --> 4922.8
mass attracting mass it's still based on

4919.76 --> 4925.1990000000005
that newtonian gravity concept

4922.8 --> 4928.719
because that's the only model that can

4925.199 --> 4931.04
actually do that the einstein gravity

4928.719 --> 4933.28
doesn't give you a tool

4931.04 --> 4935.92
that you can build a vast

4933.28 --> 4939.92
all-encompassing model with so they need

4935.92 --> 4942.4
gravity as a force just to have a model

4939.92 --> 4945.92
of some kind

4942.4 --> 4948.159
even though it isn't a force yeah

4945.92 --> 4951.04
that's how deep duck

4948.159 --> 4953.44
dug in they are into the necessity of

4951.04 --> 4955.84
logical fallacy they need it if they

4953.44 --> 4957.44
don't get it they have nothing

4955.84 --> 4960.639
so that's what they spend their time

4957.44 --> 4960.638999999999
with doing

4961.199 --> 4965.44
making everybody [ __ ]

4963.679 --> 4967.1990000000005
making everybody

4965.44 --> 4968.799999999999
fall into

4967.199 --> 4972.5599999999995
logical traps

4968.8 --> 4975.6
so they accept logical fallacy

4972.56 --> 4979.280000000001
because then they can still have their

4975.6 --> 4979.280000000001
ball model make sense to them

4979.36 --> 4982.32
that's really what it is

4984.4 --> 4989.32
anyway

4985.679 --> 4989.32
be back in two minutes

5003.679 --> 5006.679
so

5074.4 --> 5077.879999999999
and back

5106.8 --> 5111.400000000001
no well yeah professor phil bell

5112.4 --> 5117.28
is kind of right though lumpy gas

5114.96 --> 5117.28
right

5118.159 --> 5121.44
this statement is psychological it's not

5120.32 --> 5123.36
about

5121.44 --> 5124.96
whether they're correct or not it's just

5123.36 --> 5126.239
he's like yeah

5124.96 --> 5127.92
if you're going to say to your

5126.239 --> 5129.599999999999
colleagues that the earth is flat and

5127.92 --> 5131.1990000000005
not a ball they're going to be

5129.6 --> 5133.76
delusional and you're just going to

5131.199 --> 5134.96
think like oh that's you're just being

5133.76 --> 5136.4800000000005
silly

5134.96 --> 5138.639
because that could never be wrong it

5136.48 --> 5141.5199999999995
could never not be a ball because why

5138.639 --> 5143.679
else would everybody

5141.52 --> 5145.1990000000005
tell you for hundreds of years that it's

5143.679 --> 5146.4
a ball right

5145.199 --> 5148.879999999999
that's where they're at so he's

5146.4 --> 5150.799999999999
basically saying yeah yeah people are

5148.88 --> 5152.96
delusional

5150.8 --> 5154.639
about it

5152.96 --> 5156.88
you don't have to be angry at him for

5154.639 --> 5156.88
that

5163.04 --> 5166.239
yeah

5164.32 --> 5168.88
yeah truth might be truth and water

5166.239 --> 5171.12
might be level but people that believe

5168.88 --> 5173.36
in bald earth don't care

5171.12 --> 5175.04
they'll just twist

5173.36 --> 5178.32
whatever they can

5175.04 --> 5178.32
in order to make it a ball

5179.199 --> 5182.4
right

5180.08 --> 5184.32
that's how we've ended up with

5182.4 --> 5185.839999999999
anti-flag earther

5184.32 --> 5187.679
cosmology

5185.84 --> 5190.159000000001
where you know the earth is a ball

5187.679 --> 5192.96
because it looks perfectly flat looks

5190.159 --> 5195.12
and measures flat

5192.96 --> 5197.28
all these tools you can only use because

5195.12 --> 5200.5599999999995
it's flat like a sexton

5197.28 --> 5202.639
but yeah terrestrial refraction

5200.56 --> 5205.76
proves the earth is a ball because it

5202.639 --> 5209.679
looks perfectly flat

5205.76 --> 5212.0
and it is like perfectly corrected

5209.679 --> 5214.719
to appear flat because of terrestrial

5212.0 --> 5214.719
refraction

5215.04 --> 5220.159
because they don't care

5217.52 --> 5222.639
they don't care

5220.159 --> 5224.719
to know things that break their model

5222.639 --> 5228.2390000000005
they only want reinforcement they're

5224.719 --> 5230.96
religious zealots

5228.239 --> 5234.638999999999
they don't care for information that

5230.96 --> 5234.639
disproves anything they say

5237.28 --> 5243.12
right they're not going to counter it

5240.639 --> 5245.679
they're just going to misunderstand and

5243.12 --> 5247.5199999999995
then insert that misunderstanding to you

5245.679 --> 5250.4800000000005
over and over again because that's what

5247.52 --> 5252.4800000000005
they needed to learn to accept in order

5250.48 --> 5254.48
to be able to maintain

5252.48 --> 5257.12
the ball religion

5254.48 --> 5261.759999999999
you have to embrace fallacy

5257.12 --> 5261.76
and reinforce that and justify it

5262.639 --> 5267.84
and then you can keep your ball religion

5264.96 --> 5267.84
no matter what

5296.0 --> 5301.199
both newton einstein models are used for

5298.719 --> 5303.36
different yeah i know

5301.199 --> 5305.36
yeah also know that

5303.36 --> 5309.36
newton's model

5305.36 --> 5311.759999999999
he never claimed the hypothesis for it

5309.36 --> 5313.5199999999995
yeah it's not officially recognized

5311.76 --> 5315.1990000000005
anymore

5313.52 --> 5316.96
yeah officially

5315.199 --> 5318.96
you're going to deny that professor phil

5316.96 --> 5322.92
bell that newtonian gravity is

5318.96 --> 5322.92
disclaimed officially

5323.04 --> 5330.08
newtonian's model is not what gravity is

5325.92 --> 5330.08
officially do you deny that

5330.56 --> 5334.159000000001
are you gonna go to fight the flat earth

5332.32 --> 5335.5199999999995
route of delusion

5334.159 --> 5338.159
making it up

5335.52 --> 5338.159000000001
as you go

5338.719 --> 5343.52
saying that the bending of space-time

5341.04 --> 5345.679
causes an emergent force of gravity

5343.52 --> 5350.120000000001
which is literally made up there's no

5345.679 --> 5350.12
backing for that at all

5351.199 --> 5356.96
i mean i like that creative response to

5354.32 --> 5359.679
it but it's not official

5356.96 --> 5364.8
it isn't newtonian gravity is

5359.679 --> 5369.0
disclaimed it's it doesn't work anymore

5364.8 --> 5369.0
it's not what gravity is

5381.679 --> 5387.4400000000005
all that evidence of the globe

5385.04 --> 5390.4
what evidence there is no [ __ ]

5387.44 --> 5393.839999999999
evidence of the globe ass

5390.4 --> 5393.839999999999
get the [ __ ] out of here

5402.8 --> 5407.28
i've addressed it

5405.12 --> 5411.04
it's only fallacies

5407.28 --> 5411.04
only have fallacies

5411.28 --> 5416.4
and the reinforcement of the fallacies

5414.239 --> 5419.5199999999995
this contortion of what science really

5416.4 --> 5421.599999999999
is in order to favor yourselves and make

5419.52 --> 5424.2390000000005
conceptual things

5421.6 --> 5428.360000000001
claimable as real when they are

5424.239 --> 5428.36
obviously not real

5434.95 --> 5438.0
[Music]

5441.24 --> 5444.3189999999995
[Music]

5446.84 --> 5452.96
ah

5448.44 --> 5452.96
mainstream science means

5459.28 --> 5462.5599999999995
god

5460.239 --> 5465.759999999999
you have any idea how freaking funny

5462.56 --> 5465.76
that is to read that

5467.52 --> 5474.2390000000005
mainstream sciences

5470.719 --> 5477.76
like that doesn't make any sense

5474.239 --> 5481.919999999999
either it's science or it's not science

5477.76 --> 5484.0
science doesn't have classifications

5481.92 --> 5487.28
it's a method it proves the cause of an

5484.0 --> 5489.36
effect or it doesn't

5487.28 --> 5491.28
if it doesn't prove the cause of the

5489.36 --> 5493.12
effect

5491.28 --> 5495.12
if it does something else then it's not

5493.12 --> 5497.44
science it's not the scientific method

5495.12 --> 5497.44
yeah

5497.92 --> 5504.4
there's no like oh fringe is science

5501.84 --> 5507.04
well is it scientific or is it very

5504.4 --> 5509.44
manipulating of independent variable or

5507.04 --> 5509.44
isn't it

5509.679 --> 5516.88
pretty sure that mainstream science very

5512.719 --> 5520.0
rarely involves the scientific method

5516.88 --> 5523.28
right it's just a cultural grouping

5520.0 --> 5523.28
it's just a name it's

5523.6 --> 5527.120000000001
it's a gnomer

5524.96 --> 5530.84
it doesn't actually involve science it's

5527.12 --> 5533.679
just like oh here is the official

5530.84 --> 5536.0
story yeah that's your mainstream

5533.679 --> 5539.679
science it's an official story it's not

5536.0 --> 5539.679
science it doesn't involve science

5539.92 --> 5549.0
it's just a bunch of blabbering

5543.28 --> 5549.0
that [ __ ] in control agree upon

5568.8 --> 5574.719
yeah just like your mainstream science

5571.84 --> 5577.12
would say oh viruses are so dangerous

5574.719 --> 5579.28
and oh

5577.12 --> 5581.76
i have to do all this [ __ ] yeah that's

5579.28 --> 5583.12
what they say is it actually supported

5581.76 --> 5584.88
by science

5583.12 --> 5588.08
no

5584.88 --> 5593.04
not at all

5588.08 --> 5595.6
like the very concept of viruses is is

5593.04 --> 5595.6
barely

5595.76 --> 5599.280000000001
supportable

5596.96 --> 5602.56
by science barely

5599.28 --> 5604.8
if any

5602.56 --> 5607.1990000000005
like they have things they show you

5604.8 --> 5610.8
supposedly to back up proof but a lot of

5607.199 --> 5613.28
that is literally just artistic

5610.8 --> 5615.84
it's it's lies

5613.28 --> 5618.88
it's not actually based on logical

5615.84 --> 5621.12
consistent function

5618.88 --> 5623.28
it's more like oh this is what happens

5621.12 --> 5625.28
you grind up a bunch of stuff and then

5623.28 --> 5626.159
you'll zoom in and it's like oh look at

5625.28 --> 5627.599999999999
that

5626.159 --> 5631.759999999999
look at that

5627.6 --> 5633.679
is that what the virus is yeah

5631.76 --> 5635.52
that's what the virus is now because

5633.679 --> 5638.4
that's what it looks like every time

5635.52 --> 5641.76
right basically looking at water bubbles

5638.4 --> 5644.719
grounded up stuff that clogs together

5641.76 --> 5646.88
and then shows certain type of sites

5644.719 --> 5649.28
that's what they call a virus

5646.88 --> 5651.52
they can't even prove it does anything

5649.28 --> 5654.48
or is like

5651.52 --> 5654.4800000000005
a solid thing

5655.12 --> 5659.44
with the solid structure of any sort

5657.36 --> 5662.159
they did nothing

5659.44 --> 5664.239
yeah that's accepted as mainstream

5662.159 --> 5666.879999999999
science yeah

5664.239 --> 5669.44
even though it is kind of a fraud it is

5666.88 --> 5671.52
fraud it is not actually

5669.44 --> 5673.36
backed by science

5671.52 --> 5676.320000000001
they can barely prove

5673.36 --> 5676.32
viruses exist

5676.48 --> 5683.48
they can make a lot of stories up about

5678.8 --> 5683.4800000000005
them though a lot of stories

5695.6 --> 5699.92
newton's gravity is what we teach

5697.28 --> 5703.679
engineers yeah i know you do professor

5699.92 --> 5705.28
phil bill i already explained that why

5703.679 --> 5707.1990000000005
why it is being taught to engineers

5705.28 --> 5708.719
right because of the pragmatism what do

5707.199 --> 5713.119
engineers do

5708.719 --> 5716.2390000000005
well they mostly deal in solid objects

5713.119 --> 5718.799999999999
solid objects work just great if you

5716.239 --> 5722.718999999999
quickly want to calculate the natural

5718.8 --> 5724.719
relative density this equilibrium forces

5722.719 --> 5725.76
through the gravity formula

5724.719 --> 5730.8
right

5725.76 --> 5733.6
but i'll bet you that a like a gas

5730.8 --> 5735.679
plasma pressure

5733.6 --> 5738.400000000001
system engineer they're not going to be

5735.679 --> 5740.88
using gravity a lot

5738.4 --> 5743.04
i mean still for the overall weight of

5740.88 --> 5746.0
the entire thing

5743.04 --> 5748.32
but yeah gas dynamics

5746.0 --> 5750.32
doesn't really work out that great right

5748.32 --> 5753.28
if you're just a solid engineer which

5750.32 --> 5757.5199999999995
most engineers are working with solids

5753.28 --> 5760.8
metals and whatever rock

5757.52 --> 5762.719
concrete yeah and gravity works really

5760.8 --> 5765.52
easy right you just

5762.719 --> 5768.4800000000005
learn the little trick how to do how to

5765.52 --> 5770.719
calculate it and it works out great does

5768.48 --> 5773.04
it mean it's actually based on a real

5770.719 --> 5774.88
thing though it's just a tool a

5773.04 --> 5777.199
mathematical tool

5774.88 --> 5781.119
it's a formula

5777.199 --> 5781.119
it's not literally that

5781.36 --> 5786.5599999999995
it isn't a complete formula it's

5783.6 --> 5788.8
pragmatic it's a little tool that works

5786.56 --> 5791.92
very easily very quickly

5788.8 --> 5798.159000000001
it's not based on physical reality the

5791.92 --> 5800.159
model that it uses isn't actually real

5798.159 --> 5802.4
and you can think of it as real but it

5800.159 --> 5802.4
isn't

5804.159 --> 5806.5599999999995
yeah

5805.44 --> 5808.719
so

5806.56 --> 5811.119000000001
yeah engineers are taught newtonian

5808.719 --> 5813.92
gravity well taught they're

5811.119 --> 5816.32
basically handed in as a tools like okay

5813.92 --> 5818.08
here you have your newtonian system yeah

5816.32 --> 5819.44
you can calculate things really quickly

5818.08 --> 5821.5199999999995
with that it's very easy you don't have

5819.44 --> 5823.839999999999
to worry about it

5821.52 --> 5826.159000000001
yeah

5823.84 --> 5829.76
so it's a tool

5826.159 --> 5833.28
it's not actually scientific reality

5829.76 --> 5834.4800000000005
though it's just a shortcut handy-dandy

5833.28 --> 5837.599999999999
tool

5834.48 --> 5837.599999999999
calculation tool

5839.199 --> 5845.36
it isn't actually the reality

5843.119 --> 5849.119
but it works out the calculations work

5845.36 --> 5851.44
out right the formulas work out

5849.119 --> 5854.48
work out well enough enough that it's

5851.44 --> 5856.5599999999995
still being used by engineers

5854.48 --> 5859.36
it's not actually based on physical

5856.56 --> 5859.360000000001
reality though

5863.28 --> 5869.679
neither of them are real oh

5865.84 --> 5872.8
you don't know what gravity actually is

5869.679 --> 5875.36
then why are you claiming science for it

5872.8 --> 5878.159000000001
you know the thing about sciences is you

5875.36 --> 5880.96
actually have to know

5878.159 --> 5883.119
what it is

5880.96 --> 5887.52
that you're claiming

5883.119 --> 5887.5199999999995
before you can apply the sciences

5888.239 --> 5894.44
man

5890.239 --> 5894.44
i gotta screenshot this

5904.32 --> 5907.719
this is hilarious

5933.76 --> 5936.76
okay

5953.6 --> 5957.52
yeah thank you for that

5955.44 --> 5960.159
professor phil bell it's it's freaking

5957.52 --> 5960.159000000001
hilarious

5961.28 --> 5967.32
i'm gonna

5963.52 --> 5967.320000000001
share this with the guys

5967.98 --> 5972.539
[Applause]

5984.88 --> 5991.08
oh man time's almost

5987.36 --> 5991.08
show is almost done

5999.44 --> 6002.44
so

6024.4 --> 6029.04
can you name a few of your favorite i

6027.119 --> 6033.32
don't really have favorite scientific

6029.04 --> 6033.32
experiments see me traveler

6041.119 --> 6045.119
but yeah you know the the typical thing

6044.08 --> 6047.28
about

6045.119 --> 6050.719
scientific experiments is that the most

6047.28 --> 6052.239
important ones are so simple

6050.719 --> 6054.88
that

6052.239 --> 6056.48
we don't even realize it

6054.88 --> 6058.8
like for example

6056.48 --> 6063.04
water boiling

6058.8 --> 6063.04
heat causes water to boil

6063.119 --> 6065.839999999999
right

6076.88 --> 6083.36
right but i'm not yeah i don't really

6079.92 --> 6085.76
have like favorites

6083.36 --> 6088.5599999999995
i mean i like things like chemistry and

6085.76 --> 6091.119000000001
i like pressure mechanics but that's not

6088.56 --> 6093.679
necessarily science

6091.119 --> 6096.159
i think actually to be fair that science

6093.679 --> 6097.92
is kind of tedious but that's good it's

6096.159 --> 6100.32
supposed to be

6097.92 --> 6103.1990000000005
because it's so imp it's all about the

6100.32 --> 6105.119
rigidity and the inflexibility and the

6103.199 --> 6107.28
demands

6105.119 --> 6109.36
that's what it's about it's almost like

6107.28 --> 6112.239
judicial

6109.36 --> 6115.199
but for physics it's very important it's

6112.239 --> 6117.28
not supposed to be exciting right that's

6115.199 --> 6119.28
just called [ __ ] around

6117.28 --> 6121.84
chemistry

6119.28 --> 6125.44
whatever

6121.84 --> 6128.2390000000005
but yeah the popular phrase now is that

6125.44 --> 6130.638999999999
that science anybody could do science

6128.239 --> 6133.44
you just do little thingies and all

6130.639 --> 6134.96
science slides yeah that's not actually

6133.44 --> 6137.119
science

6134.96 --> 6139.92
right that's the problem is that they

6137.119 --> 6143.92
thought oh let's call every [ __ ]

6139.92 --> 6146.08
thing you can do science now

6143.92 --> 6148.4800000000005
that's where things went to [ __ ] that's

6146.08 --> 6150.5599999999995
where certainly oh oh everything is

6148.48 --> 6154.4
science now oh okay well then we can

6150.56 --> 6157.76
just say something as scientific

6154.4 --> 6159.36
and not actually provide the science we

6157.76 --> 6162.0
could just

6159.36 --> 6165.599999999999
do some other weird little thing and

6162.0 --> 6165.6
just say that science see

6166.56 --> 6170.400000000001
yeah

6167.6 --> 6173.4400000000005
that's how the science

6170.4 --> 6175.599999999999
revolution happened and now nobody

6173.44 --> 6178.159
remembers what actually science is it's

6175.6 --> 6180.639
become all nonsense it's more like a

6178.159 --> 6180.638999999999
culture

6183.6 --> 6190.4400000000005
yeah okay hey lumpy gas could you please

6187.04 --> 6190.44
stop it

6196.4 --> 6200.879999999999
you don't need heat to get water to boil

6198.96 --> 6202.88
that's not relevant

6200.88 --> 6206.4800000000005
professor philbo it's not relevant that

6202.88 --> 6207.92
you don't need heat to get water to boil

6206.48 --> 6208.718999999999
to prove

6207.92 --> 6212.8
that

6208.719 --> 6213.84
heat causes water to boil

6212.8 --> 6218.119000000001
yeah

6213.84 --> 6218.119000000001
it's not relevant to that

6220.159 --> 6222.879999999999
sure there are other ways you could do

6221.84 --> 6225.1990000000005
it

6222.88 --> 6226.719
does that matter to the fact the

6225.199 --> 6228.638999999999
scientific fact

6226.719 --> 6231.119
that heat

6228.639 --> 6233.92
and gathering when increasing when you

6231.119 --> 6236.639
yeah when it's enough heat 100 100

6233.92 --> 6239.92
degrees celsius standard atmospheric

6236.639 --> 6242.56
pressure standard pressure

6239.92 --> 6243.92
causes it to boil so

6242.56 --> 6245.52
it doesn't matter that there are other

6243.92 --> 6248.4800000000005
factors at play

6245.52 --> 6250.56
the heat is what causes it to boil so

6248.48 --> 6252.4
don't even understand why you said that

6250.56 --> 6255.52
you don't need heat to get water to boil

6252.4 --> 6259.199
yeah thanks thanks what's the use like

6255.52 --> 6259.1990000000005
does that make it not science

6259.28 --> 6261.84
i don't get it

6263.6 --> 6267.119000000001
are there other

6264.8 --> 6269.04
important scientific experiments in my

6267.119 --> 6273.239
opinion

6269.04 --> 6273.239
i don't really care at this moment

6277.44 --> 6282.32
yeah i know professor i literally

6279.52 --> 6282.320000000001
mentioned that

6283.84 --> 6286.719
it's part of it

6287.28 --> 6291.119
right but if you

6289.44 --> 6292.96
increase the heat

6291.119 --> 6296.159
then technically the pressure will not

6292.96 --> 6296.159
be even relevant

6296.719 --> 6298.96
right

6299.6 --> 6303.6
because even if

6301.52 --> 6306.96
there's a lot of pressure that surrounds

6303.6 --> 6308.4800000000005
the water if it's like in a tanker

6306.96 --> 6310.159
like in in

6308.48 --> 6312.32
yeah

6310.159 --> 6314.5599999999995
like a gas tank but filled with water

6312.32 --> 6316.5599999999995
yeah if you're gonna heat it it's still

6314.56 --> 6318.080000000001
eventually going to boil

6316.56 --> 6322.159000000001
right doesn't matter

6318.08 --> 6325.5199999999995
the more pressure causes it to

6322.159 --> 6327.679
uh yeah boil at a higher temperature

6325.52 --> 6330.0
but it's not relevant to the scientific

6327.679 --> 6332.4
fact that if you keep introducing heat

6330.0 --> 6334.0
to water it will eventually boil pretty

6332.4 --> 6336.08
much no matter the rest of the

6334.0 --> 6339.08
circumstances

6336.08 --> 6339.08
yeah

6345.28 --> 6350.159
heat will not work

6347.119 --> 6350.159
yeah so

6350.639 --> 6356.08
that's just not correct

6352.4 --> 6359.839999999999
heat will absolutely boil water

6356.08 --> 6359.84
even with high pressure

6360.159 --> 6365.679
the pressure is completely relevant yeah

6362.96 --> 6368.32
but if you keep increasing the heat

6365.679 --> 6370.88
then it's not relevant

6368.32 --> 6372.88
if you keep amping up the heat it's not

6370.88 --> 6374.639
relevant what the pressure is it is

6372.88 --> 6378.08
going to boil

6374.639 --> 6378.08
you understand that don't you

6381.84 --> 6386.400000000001
if you keep upping the heat it's going

6384.159 --> 6388.239
to boil doesn't matter what the [ __ ]

6386.4 --> 6390.0
pressure is

6388.239 --> 6393.04
it doesn't matter even if it's like

6390.0 --> 6395.28
hermetically sealed in a steel

6393.04 --> 6398.08
tanker

6395.28 --> 6399.759999999999
if you're going to introduce heat it is

6398.08 --> 6402.159
going to boil

6399.76 --> 6405.84
even if that means that the tanker blows

6402.159 --> 6408.799999999999
up eventually it is going to boil

6405.84 --> 6410.719
pressure doesn't matter

6408.8 --> 6412.719
it's going to influence the boiling

6410.719 --> 6414.88
point but it isn't

6412.719 --> 6418.6
going to prevent

6414.88 --> 6418.6
the water from boiling

6431.199 --> 6434.638999999999
right i'm gonna run out the show

6437.199 --> 6441.36
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6439.44 --> 6443.44
like this show if you did then please

little paypal yesterday over at flutter

6485.84 --> 6489.52
of debate by the way thank you for that

6487.44 --> 6491.919999999999
if you're listening

6489.52 --> 6495.360000000001
uh i'll be back tomorrow with flat earth

6491.92 --> 6497.6
early bird number 1179

6495.36 --> 6499.119
that would be on a wednesday and i'm

6497.6 --> 6501.76
going to join the flat earth debates

6499.119 --> 6504.08
which is already started up friday oh

6501.76 --> 6507.360000000001
right yeah guns will never run yeah yeah

6504.08 --> 6507.36
i'll be looking forward to that

6507.6 --> 6510.88
