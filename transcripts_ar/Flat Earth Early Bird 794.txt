and it is kind of cold that way

115.36 --> 122.479
kind of a damp cold and damp

119.6 --> 122.479
monday morning

123.92 --> 129.84
the first of january 2021

131.36 --> 138.959
and i started on time haha

135.28 --> 142.879
right so i got green tea with me

138.959 --> 145.2
it's still very hot

142.879 --> 147.35999999999999
let's see what kind of notes i made

145.2 --> 150.39999999999998
yesterday

147.36 --> 150.87900000000002
ah of course i did not make any notes at

150.4 --> 154.84
all

150.879 --> 157.84
brilliant let's see

154.84 --> 157.84
okay

162.959 --> 166.56
yeah yeah so this show was really short

165.04 --> 168.84
it's the shortest show i've done in a

166.56 --> 171.84
long time

168.84 --> 171.84
uh

178.64 --> 183.599
yeah yeah the flat earth debates

181.04 --> 186.319
premiere

183.599 --> 188.72
from friday was really good to sit

186.319 --> 192.64
through that again

188.72 --> 192.64
lots of energy uh

195.519 --> 199.68
yeah bible literalist also went live but

198.48 --> 205.11999999999998
i missed out

199.68 --> 207.36
i just didn't get to watch it

205.12 --> 207.36
uh

208.959 --> 213.84
let's see

215.04 --> 227.44
i clicked it a bit but then got

216.959 --> 232.64000000000001
distracted again

227.44 --> 232.64
wait right yeah yeah

237.12 --> 241.68
yeah that was pretty much it the rest

239.36 --> 244.72000000000003
it's just been south park

241.68 --> 244.72
a bit of gaming

250.4 --> 254.56
it's been weird because you have been

252.56 --> 256.56
playing polish gate 3 and i think i

254.56 --> 259.84
pretty much

256.56 --> 262.56
well finished like

259.84 --> 264.479
i covered all the the game grounds in

262.56 --> 267.28000000000003
that game right now

264.479 --> 269.84
and yeah there's supposed to be other

267.28 --> 270.15999999999997
areas but you can't really get there yet

269.84 --> 274.23999999999995
so

270.16 --> 278.32000000000005
it's still a sort of a trial run set up

274.24 --> 278.32
so now i'm kind of like yeah done with

280.84 --> 285.75899999999996
it

282.24 --> 289.12
so yeah a bit disappointed in

285.759 --> 292.639
in that didn't take very long once i

289.12 --> 292.639
figured out how the game worked

293.68 --> 300.88
but yeah it is

296.72 --> 300.88000000000005
it's kind of an interesting game it

301.84 --> 307.59999999999997
it is definitely very

304.88 --> 308.479
dungeon dragons with a turn-based system

307.6 --> 310.0
i like

308.479 --> 311.68
i'd like to i like the fighting

310.0 --> 314.639
mechanics it's a little bit more

311.68 --> 314.639
difficult this way

317.039 --> 321.68
but i liked it uh

320.24 --> 324.24
[Music]

321.68 --> 326.56
as for the atmosphere and all that i

324.24 --> 327.759
know it reminded me a lot about dragon

326.56 --> 330.96
force and many

327.759 --> 333.759
was it dragon force no wait

330.96 --> 333.75899999999996
what's that again

334.639 --> 342.16
it's a dragon what's that game again

338.96 --> 343.84
i have it i have a physical game

342.16 --> 346.56
but what's it called again something

343.84 --> 346.56
with a dragon

351.68 --> 367.84000000000003
was it

368.16 --> 372.24
now dragon force is the metal band

370.08 --> 374.96
that's not the thing i meant

372.24 --> 374.96000000000004
that's the game

379.28 --> 384.96
it's a special separate separated story

389.039 --> 398.639
wait i think i'm gonna look through it

393.52 --> 398.639
i think i actually bought it on dvd

402.96 --> 409.84
this is i think i got it here but ah

410.479 --> 413.75899999999996
a little complicated

413.84 --> 419.35999999999996
oh that's it yeah yeah that was dragon

417.199 --> 422.8
force it was dragon h

419.36 --> 425.039
that game yeah reminds me a lot about

422.8 --> 425.039
that

429.28 --> 435.52
right so it has a lot of cut scenes that

433.44 --> 437.599
were not flawless but yeah it's a true

435.52 --> 441.52
it's the

437.599 --> 441.52
work in progress version whatever

442.0 --> 450.08
but yeah they built like the same

445.199 --> 453.199
camping ground setup

450.08 --> 457.039
it has a lot of similarities to that

453.199 --> 460.56
and yeah it seems like it was definitely

457.039 --> 464.56
inspired partially on dragon age

460.56 --> 467.599
like in how the game works

464.56 --> 469.52
and hey that game wasn't bad at all so

467.599 --> 471.68
i do remember having a lot of fun with

469.52 --> 471.68
it

474.56 --> 480.879
anyway so yeah that's

478.0 --> 480.879
pretty much that

491.28 --> 494.55999999999995
watch some south park

495.68 --> 499.759
it keeps surprising me how good it is

504.84 --> 508.96
really

506.639 --> 508.96000000000004
hey

509.919 --> 521.8389999999999
hello aj m1966

515.12 --> 521.839

540.64 --> 549.8389999999999
so fine by me

564.16 --> 566.7199999999999
let's see

571.92 --> 579.12
anything else that stood out in the news

576.88 --> 581.4399999999999
standing out in the news these days is

579.12 --> 591.839
not easy

581.44 --> 591.839
because the news is very loud

616.839 --> 619.839
so

645.92 --> 661.8389999999999
slanty hello jedo

650.8 --> 661.8389999999999
what does that mean

663.44 --> 675.839
there is a coop in myanmar really

688.56 --> 691.68
where did you see that

701.279 --> 717.8389999999999
yeah my new sources are kind of limited

704.0 --> 717.839
that way

720.56 --> 726.2399999999999
aslante is hello in irish gaelic

726.32 --> 731.839
do you pronounce it slanty

742.839 --> 745.839
hmm

747.44 --> 753.36
okay well since that's happening now and

750.72 --> 754.0790000000001
people are not asking me hey irwin talk

753.36 --> 755.76
about this

754.079 --> 757.4399999999999
talk about that

755.76 --> 760.0
[Music]

757.44 --> 773.839
i'll just look it up i'm just gonna be a

760.0 --> 773.839
digger then

776.24 --> 787.839
military stage go okay

805.279 --> 811.4399999999999
it feels sort of like business as usual

808.639 --> 811.44
when you go around

811.519 --> 816.32
most of the streets okay so there's no

813.44 --> 820.1600000000001
big riots or anything

816.32 --> 823.1990000000001
seems like there was election

820.16 --> 826.56
issues or failure and now they

823.199 --> 829.8389999999999
yeah it's just the military took over to

826.56 --> 829.8389999999999
i guess get things in order

834.8 --> 843.8389999999999
okay so the u.n is very against it

868.839 --> 871.839
so

879.279 --> 884.88
okay there is pro-military protesters

883.199 --> 888.3199999999999
out there apparently

884.88 --> 891.519
right so yeah not

888.32 --> 895.12
getting too much data out of that let's

891.519 --> 895.12
see if we can find something more

896.72 --> 899.839
all right

909.23 --> 912.649
[Music]

924.839 --> 941.839
okay what the hell is that noise

959.279 --> 962.959
sorry for the silence i'm reading

960.88 --> 965.6
through this news right now because this

962.959 --> 968.6389999999999
is old news to me and

965.6 --> 969.0400000000001
since the chat is not overflowing with

968.639 --> 972.32
the

969.04 --> 976.7199999999999
opportunities to interact with

972.32 --> 983.839
other than just talking about this

976.72 --> 983.839
i'm gonna dig right here live

987.759 --> 991.6
right so it seems yeah

992.48 --> 998.399
there was some fraud

996.56 --> 1000.399
during the election with the election

998.399 --> 1002.8
list or something

1000.399 --> 1004.959
so some shenanigans going on and the

1002.8 --> 1008.0
military just

1004.959 --> 1010.0
decided to take over so maybe a

1008.0 --> 1012.72
political party was kind of like

1010.0 --> 1016.639
overstepping their boundaries a little

1012.72 --> 1016.639
sounds very familiar these days in

1022.839 --> 1025.839
general

1039.28 --> 1045.28
oh somebody has been detained

1043.12 --> 1045.28
oh

1047.839 --> 1053.84
the de facto leader aung san tsuki

1055.84 --> 1067.84
however you say that

1076.0 --> 1095.84
and this article says that she did win

1078.799 --> 1095.84
by a landslide apparently

1120.84 --> 1123.84
so

1154.24 --> 1158.88
right so hmm

1158.96 --> 1163.52
there's different types of official

1161.2 --> 1167.6000000000001
responses from other countries

1163.52 --> 1169.12
but img seeing very little in content

1167.6 --> 1172.48
detail as to

1169.12 --> 1175.76
why exactly besides

1172.48 --> 1176.72
there's been fraud apparently in some

1175.76 --> 1179.6
way

1176.72 --> 1180.4
according to the military at least it's

1179.6 --> 1183.12
just very

1180.4 --> 1183.52
little in detail response so i don't

1183.12 --> 1185.84
know

1183.52 --> 1188.799
exactly what happened from what i'm

1185.84 --> 1188.799
reading right here

1190.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
that's it

1226.0 --> 1230.0
right anyway hello zak

1230.48 --> 1249.84
and the random explorer

1234.0 --> 1249.84
right so yeah that's happening

1252.96 --> 1256.72
all right zach is that how you're gonna

1255.039 --> 1259.84
leave it just saying

1256.72 --> 1262.72
what and that's it

1259.84 --> 1266.08
just leave it there leave it hanging

1262.72 --> 1266.08
there that's a great entry

1268.559 --> 1277.84
it's not confusing at all right zach

1296.04 --> 1299.22
[Music]

1316.84 --> 1319.84
okay

1328.96 --> 1336.08
so unless somebody has some very

1332.32 --> 1338.72
you unique information concerning

1336.08 --> 1338.72
myanmar

1340.32 --> 1346.3999999999999
that'll basically give more insight onto

1343.679 --> 1349.3600000000001
why exactly what was going on what were

1346.4 --> 1349.3600000000001
the policies

1350.159 --> 1355.5200000000002
or what were yeah not like i don't know

1353.679 --> 1356.48
that political party at all they could

1355.52 --> 1358.8799999999999
literally be

1356.48 --> 1361.039
just like the democratic party in some

1358.88 --> 1363.919
way or

1361.039 --> 1364.64
probably not like the us democratic

1363.919 --> 1366.96
party

1364.64 --> 1369.44
so i don't know i don't know what's

1366.96 --> 1372.48
happening if there was like this

1369.44 --> 1375.1200000000001
globalist coup going on from that party

1372.48 --> 1375.919
that perhaps the military was stopping i

1375.12 --> 1380.2399999999998
don't know

1375.919 --> 1383.44
i don't have a single clue at this point

1380.24 --> 1385.52
but considering what i've learned about

1383.44 --> 1389.1200000000001
the world in general i wouldn't be

1385.52 --> 1393.12
surprised right especially if

1389.12 --> 1396.0
the u.n disapproves of it

1393.12 --> 1396.559
because they only disapprove of coup of

1396.0 --> 1400.32
a coup

1396.559 --> 1403.84
when it's their

1400.32 --> 1403.84
people see

1406.0 --> 1409.36
because say for example there would be

1408.799 --> 1411.52
well

1409.36 --> 1413.28
it's already over now but like there

1411.52 --> 1414.6399999999999
would have been some kind of coup

1413.28 --> 1417.6789999999999
against trump or

1414.64 --> 1420.48
or a person that is approached

1417.679 --> 1420.96
like trump then everybody would be a

1420.48 --> 1424.559
yeah

1420.96 --> 1426.08
yeah yeah see that's i'm immediately

1424.559 --> 1428.08
like oh okay

1426.08 --> 1430.0
so maybe the military over there

1428.08 --> 1433.4399999999998
actually stopped a globalist

1430.0 --> 1436.0
coup how about that now

1433.44 --> 1437.279
i don't know because i don't know

1436.0 --> 1440.08
anything about

1437.279 --> 1441.84
that party and their policies i don't

1440.08 --> 1444.799
know i couldn't find anything

1441.84 --> 1446.72
just there i probably maybe i'll just do

1444.799 --> 1447.44
it because nobody else here in chat is

1446.72 --> 1451.039
inputting

1447.44 --> 1451.039
anything useful thanks

1451.2 --> 1457.44
oh i'm also ungrateful

1454.4 --> 1473.8400000000001
so ungrateful but yeah it is kind of

1457.44 --> 1473.8400000000001
useless like this

1483.84 --> 1490.0
right yeah just looking at wiki

1487.919 --> 1492.0
you can see all the parties with some

1490.0 --> 1495.36
rough descriptions that'll be at least

1492.0 --> 1495.36
somewhat freaking helpful

1496.08 --> 1501.84
now where's that damn list

1512.84 --> 1517.12
okay national league for

1526.84 --> 1529.84
democracy

1539.12 --> 1547.279
okay let's look again no

1542.559 --> 1550.559
like what was the name

1547.279 --> 1553.279
of that party again

1550.559 --> 1558.1589999999999
this time freaking remember yeah it was

1553.279 --> 1558.159
a national league of democracy right

1559.12 --> 1571.84
so that one has been in power

1597.44 --> 1604.799
um right

1601.36 --> 1613.84
so yeah that's not really using any

1604.799 --> 1613.84
specific clarity

1642.48 --> 1648.72
okay thanks oompa loompa yeah that's

1645.919 --> 1648.72
really nice

1648.76 --> 1651.96
[Music]

1652.88 --> 1659.5200000000002
no right so

1657.279 --> 1660.32
that's the super informa superficial

1659.52 --> 1665.039
information

1660.32 --> 1665.039
concerning myanmar

1665.919 --> 1669.2
don't know more details in the moment i

1668.559 --> 1671.84
would have

1669.2 --> 1672.72
liked to known a little more but yeah

1671.84 --> 1675.9189999999999
just

1672.72 --> 1675.919
couldn't really find it

1677.76 --> 1680.8799999999999
so i'm not going to be

1681.279 --> 1685.919
like an alex jones or something on the

1684.08 --> 1688.399
surface with it and just start

1685.919 --> 1690.3990000000001
like oh they are the democratic party

1688.399 --> 1692.799
they are even though they are

1690.399 --> 1694.84
literally it is in the name but it

1692.799 --> 1697.84
doesn't necessarily mean that they are

1694.84 --> 1697.84
globalists

1699.919 --> 1704.96
they probably are these days you know

1703.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
but

1704.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
i don't know it's not really revealed

1718.48 --> 1723.679
risky cabbages i don't know

1721.84 --> 1739.84
about falling numbers i think the

1723.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
numbers are just fine

1760.32 --> 1765.52
all right okay yeah i'm not gonna wait

1762.96 --> 1768.24
for chad anymore

1765.52 --> 1770.559
just gonna dig around start blabbering

1768.24 --> 1770.559
about

1778.84 --> 1781.84
whatever

1788.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
all right yeah this was a weird little

1790.799 --> 1795.84
detail thing

1799.44 --> 1806.159
for some reason google made a threat

1802.64 --> 1810.159
against australia

1806.159 --> 1814.0
to retract its services like what

1810.159 --> 1818.3200000000002
but microsoft was ready to replace it

1814.0 --> 1822.0
with bing so that kind of stood out

1818.32 --> 1825.36
to me

1822.0 --> 1825.36
but i'm kind of like why

1825.919 --> 1830.72
did google even threaten australia to

1834.84 --> 1837.84
retract

1845.76 --> 1851.84
oh it's because of some regulation law

1848.84 --> 1851.84
over

1852.08 --> 1856.96
over search engines or advertisement

1854.48 --> 1856.96
something

1860.72 --> 1865.84
that's from what i'm reading right here

1862.72 --> 1865.84
so that happened

1873.679 --> 1880.3200000000002
all right yeah let's just throw it out

1877.12 --> 1883.6789999999999
there you want to get riled up

1880.32 --> 1884.72
some new york officer apparently pepper

1883.679 --> 1888.0800000000002
sprayed

1884.72 --> 1891.1200000000001
a handcuffed nine-year-old girl

1888.08 --> 1893.84
like what the [ __ ] in new york so that

1891.12 --> 1893.84
happened

1901.76 --> 1906.399
also what i've noticed it just from

1904.159 --> 1910.88
averaged out headlines

1906.399 --> 1910.8799999999999
i've noticed typically that

1912.64 --> 1916.24
like they're constantly vaccine and

1915.279 --> 1919.679
[ __ ]

1916.24 --> 1920.64
this stuff is still being promoted

1919.679 --> 1924.159
everywhere

1920.64 --> 1927.2
and advertisements terrible like even

1924.159 --> 1930.24
ads freaking ads

1927.2 --> 1933.6000000000001
pop up like in advertisement

1930.24 --> 1936.0
that are just literally advertisement

1933.6 --> 1937.76
for oh [ __ ] tight corona blah blah blah

1936.0 --> 1940.24
this is what you have to like this

1937.76 --> 1941.279
sort of public announcement [ __ ] is

1940.24 --> 1944.3990000000001
being pumped out

1941.279 --> 1945.679
as freaking paid advertisement like what

1944.399 --> 1949.4399999999998
the [ __ ]

1945.679 --> 1950.48
so that is happening and at the same

1949.44 --> 1953.2
time

1950.48 --> 1953.2
there's yeah

1955.6 --> 1958.7199999999998
there are signs

1960.84 --> 1966.399
that or yeah they're signs of

1963.76 --> 1967.76
doubt slightly you don't know if it's

1966.399 --> 1970.0
enough though sights of

1967.76 --> 1971.919
signs of doubt with the corona vaccine

1970.0 --> 1974.399
it's not even a vaccine though

1971.919 --> 1976.0
just the adverse side effects the

1974.399 --> 1979.36
effects because it doesn't have

1976.0 --> 1980.159
any actual effect proclaimed doesn't do

1979.36 --> 1982.8799999999999
[ __ ]

1980.159 --> 1985.6000000000001
just makes you sick it just yeah [ __ ]

1982.88 --> 1989.2
around with your body

1985.6 --> 1992.24
and there it's not being kept

1989.2 --> 1993.1200000000001
totally silent that this is the case so

1992.24 --> 1996.159
there is still

1993.12 --> 1999.12
just signs coming out like people

1996.159 --> 1999.919
objecting and like this is not good that

1999.12 --> 2003.36
is still

1999.919 --> 2005.679
coming out simultaneously with it still

2003.36 --> 2006.559
being pushed everywhere so i'm noticing

2005.679 --> 2019.8400000000001
this

2006.559 --> 2019.84
it's different

2043.76 --> 2047.76
what what is it with burma george

2045.679 --> 2050.7200000000003
sanford by the way

2047.76 --> 2050.72
psychics traveler

2050.879 --> 2053.919
would be good if you guys stepped in

2053.44 --> 2056.079
since

2053.919 --> 2058.56
my chat is being overrun by kind of

2056.079 --> 2058.5600000000004
trolls

2059.119 --> 2075.839
it would be nice to read something else

2061.679 --> 2075.839
that i could respond to

2078.0 --> 2083.76
oh just another name from myanmar okay

2081.04 --> 2088.429
burma right so it's the same i did not

2083.76 --> 2090.639
know that thanks

2088.429 --> 2092.96
[Music]

2090.639 --> 2093.5
where's my mic standing over there

2092.96 --> 2096.57
whatever

2093.5 --> 2096.57
[Music]

2098.96 --> 2104.2400000000002
there is no crossbow for [ __ ] sake man

2102.24 --> 2117.839
like i'm gonna take that thing down i'm

2104.24 --> 2117.839
sick of it

2124.72 --> 2145.839
what is this the very first time you've

2127.92 --> 2145.839
ever seen my show um

2146.32 --> 2159.839
really how did you get to the show

2150.24 --> 2159.839
where did you find me

2172.079 --> 2177.3590000000004
right but yeah a live stream for a flat

2175.04 --> 2178.32
earth early bird show is not just going

2177.359 --> 2181.5989999999997
to be offered

2178.32 --> 2185.44
to you for the first time just out

2181.599 --> 2187.839
of nowhere did you know the earth was

2185.44 --> 2187.839
flat

2189.359 --> 2193.839
have you perhaps been watching some flat

2191.52 --> 2197.119
earth debates

2193.839 --> 2197.119
or some other show

2199.2 --> 2203.9199999999996
what do you know how did you get here

2211.119 --> 2216.2400000000002
okay let's just start

2217.04 --> 2221.359
then i have another name why would you

2218.56 --> 2223.52
choose such a youtube name

2221.359 --> 2226.0
like who calls themselves an oompa

2223.52 --> 2226.0
loompa

2226.839 --> 2229.839
seriously

2244.88 --> 2249.2000000000003
or suggest some random name you had to

2247.359 --> 2250.4
pick a name so you thought oh oompa

2249.2 --> 2252.56
loompas are funny

2250.4 --> 2254.48
people will know that and that you chose

2252.56 --> 2257.119
that because you just made a random

2254.48 --> 2261.599
youtube account

2257.119 --> 2264.6400000000003
well i can ask the same if you

2261.599 --> 2266.6400000000003
why are wind because arwen is actually

2264.64 --> 2269.839
my name

2266.64 --> 2270.7999999999997
yeah it's actually my name it's

2269.839 --> 2276.24
literally

2270.8 --> 2277.92
in my name that's why i'm called arwin

2276.24 --> 2280.64
and there's a whole history behind the

2277.92 --> 2283.76
name if you

2280.64 --> 2284.96
have a brain you would already recognize

2283.76 --> 2298.079
it

2284.96 --> 2302.16
it's coming from somewhere

2298.079 --> 2306.0
you can be a wizard he can be you know

2302.16 --> 2309.04
not fair yeah well my

2306.0 --> 2312.32
youtube name is not a wizard or

2309.04 --> 2315.359
wizard and how i

2312.32 --> 2318.48
identify is my own damn issue

2315.359 --> 2319.839
right look if this guy identifies with

2318.48 --> 2323.119
being an oompa loompa

2319.839 --> 2326.7999999999997
that's fine you know hey if that's

2323.119 --> 2328.56
what you identify with you know maybe

2326.8 --> 2329.04
you're very small you got a certain type

2328.56 --> 2333.599
of

2329.04 --> 2336.16
skin weird skin color or something

2333.599 --> 2338.0
yeah that's cool you want to be an oompa

2336.16 --> 2340.0
loompa that's fine

2338.0 --> 2341.839
if you're actually in oompa loompa then

2340.0 --> 2344.48
i get it

2341.839 --> 2346.16
but then i i'd call myself the oompa

2344.48 --> 2348.48
loompa because that's probably kind of

2346.16 --> 2348.48
rare

2350.24 --> 2356.16
right if it's just why am i taking this

2366.839 --> 2369.839
serious

2373.599 --> 2383.839
but that's r when with an e

2377.44 --> 2383.839
not i j

2384.96 --> 2391.2
our win is male

2388.8 --> 2393.6800000000003
it's alvin yeah that's correct it's

2391.2 --> 2393.68
elven

2395.2 --> 2411.839
but it's male

2429.119 --> 2433.2000000000003
so yeah that yeah it is

2433.839 --> 2438.0
so you got any point with that it's an

2436.48 --> 2441.599
actual name it's

2438.0 --> 2444.56
a name in its own language

2441.599 --> 2445.52
no i'm not the only one there's people

2444.56 --> 2449.04
out there that have

2445.52 --> 2453.2
called their kids frodo and [ __ ] right

2449.04 --> 2455.119
or having the name arwyn

2453.2 --> 2456.24
i don't think it's that weird and at

2455.119 --> 2458.96
least it's not just

2456.24 --> 2460.8799999999997
directly copy pasted from a specific

2458.96 --> 2464.079
identity

2460.88 --> 2466.48
like in the lord of the rings it's

2464.079 --> 2468.88
derived it's lent from a culture

2466.48 --> 2470.56
elven culture and i really appreciate

2468.88 --> 2472.48
that because

2470.56 --> 2474.56
well that was the right choice i think

2472.48 --> 2478.56
that

2474.56 --> 2478.56
my mother called it pretty well

2478.64 --> 2482.24
i think i remember vaguely as a very

2481.2 --> 2485.52
little kid that she

2482.24 --> 2488.24
asked and that i then

2485.52 --> 2490.24
embraced the name like consciously at

2488.24 --> 2494.8799999999997
what is it

2490.24 --> 2497.1189999999997
like before i was five

2494.88 --> 2498.6400000000003
but it's very it's odd because the

2497.119 --> 2501.839
memory is only there

2498.64 --> 2503.839
like in dream form like where i was with

2501.839 --> 2505.44
my mind a lot

2503.839 --> 2507.119
as a little kid was more in the dream

2505.44 --> 2510.319
world than in the real world so

2507.119 --> 2511.599
very little real world memories of being

2510.319 --> 2514.64
extremely young but

2511.599 --> 2523.3590000000004
yeah the divisions part of that dream

2514.64 --> 2536.0
memories oh yeah

2523.359 --> 2539.52
hey nathan oakley 98 good to see you

2536.0 --> 2543.359
inside a tetrahedron what do you mean

2539.52 --> 2545.04
inside are you claiming some kind of

2543.359 --> 2546.72
geometry

2545.04 --> 2548.88
because i think you need curvature for

2546.72 --> 2551.68
that doesn't really matter

2548.88 --> 2552.1600000000003
what type of geometry you're suggesting

2551.68 --> 2555.7599999999998
to be

2552.16 --> 2558.24
in or on concerning earth

2555.76 --> 2559.44
right if it's a sphere there's going to

2558.24 --> 2561.7599999999998
be a sphere

2559.44 --> 2563.2000000000003
edge that's going to be part of the

2561.76 --> 2564.7200000000003
horizon

2563.2 --> 2566.96
if it's some other shape then there's

2564.72 --> 2568.3999999999996
going to be if you're going by literal

2566.96 --> 2571.92
geometry there's going to be

2568.4 --> 2572.96
distinct corners and they're going to

2571.92 --> 2576.839
gravely

2572.96 --> 2579.839
impact whatever is on it one way or the

2576.839 --> 2579.839
other

2580.079 --> 2583.3590000000004
so yeah where is this

2589.359 --> 2596.7999999999997
a what a 12 sided

2593.28 --> 2607.8390000000004
sphere that makes no

2596.8 --> 2607.8390000000004
sense a sphere doesn't have 12 sides

2612.48 --> 2621.839
you're talking about the uh the dice

2615.68 --> 2621.839
shape that's different

2628.24 --> 2635.839
let's see

2644.48 --> 2649.839
uh what the hell is that

2660.839 --> 2666.319
thing

2662.64 --> 2666.319
my dice are gathering dust

2671.04 --> 2677.839
right 12 sided that's this

2680.72 --> 2688.8799999999997
yeah so where are these distinct corners

2684.96 --> 2688.88
that are pretty heavy

2689.359 --> 2695.68
see so they that's like a

2693.119 --> 2695.6800000000003
what is it

2699.44 --> 2705.76
like at least 60 degree corner so where

2702.319 --> 2708.96
are these exactly

2705.76 --> 2711.76
on the earth where's these 60 degree

2708.96 --> 2711.76
plus corners

2717.28 --> 2723.96
oh you would not notice oh it's so big

2720.48 --> 2727.2
that you would not notice

2723.96 --> 2729.599
geometrical specific edges

2727.2 --> 2730.8799999999997
that is a self-contradiction doesn't

2729.599 --> 2735.28
matter how big it is

2730.88 --> 2735.28
it's a 60 degree plus corner

2736.8 --> 2742.1600000000003
right now if you're suggesting some kind

2739.52 --> 2743.68
of spherical corner that's really cute

2742.16 --> 2747.44
it's still going to be some kind of

2743.68 --> 2751.2
geometric obstruction

2747.44 --> 2751.839
but you specific a 12-sided geometry

2751.2 --> 2756.56
right

2751.839 --> 2761.839
they have corners 60-degree plus corners

2756.56 --> 2761.839
so where

2765.839 --> 2772.7999999999997
earth then so where is the 60 degree

2769.359 --> 2775.839
curved going to geometrically obstruct

2772.8 --> 2775.8390000000004
sight where are they

2778.8 --> 2782.1600000000003
yeah i know nathan i know this guy is

2780.88 --> 2785.2000000000003
trolling

2782.16 --> 2789.52
but he was the only guy

2785.2 --> 2791.7599999999998
in chat actually talking

2789.52 --> 2794.4
so yeah i'm just gonna go to get

2791.76 --> 2796.4
conversations with trolls then if they

2794.4 --> 2798.079
these people are the only ones left in

2796.4 --> 2798.96
my chat that are actually doing

2798.079 --> 2801.28
something

2798.96 --> 2803.68
to communicate with then i'm just gonna

2801.28 --> 2806.7200000000003
troll bait

2803.68 --> 2809.7599999999998
right just gonna do that

2806.72 --> 2814.56
because what else am i gonna do

2809.76 --> 2818.079
at this point nobody's really

2814.56 --> 2820.7999999999997
yeah giving me anything to dig into i

2818.079 --> 2822.8
i got some earlier about the situation

2820.8 --> 2825.2000000000003
myanmar

2822.8 --> 2826.079
right so i looked into that a little but

2825.2 --> 2830.0
yeah

2826.079 --> 2832.5600000000004
then it stops and then oompa loompa

2830.0 --> 2834.4
came in so i just thought okay that's a

2832.56 --> 2837.44
troll

2834.4 --> 2838.64
but i'm just going to figure out what

2837.44 --> 2842.4
they're where they at

2838.64 --> 2842.4
because what else am i going to do here

2842.839 --> 2847.119
right

2844.079 --> 2849.52
i interact with my chat if nobody is

2847.119 --> 2851.359
basically handing me anything in chat

2849.52 --> 2852.24
not talking about money and just talking

2851.359 --> 2855.52
about

2852.24 --> 2856.7999999999997
subject anything that i could dig in to

2855.52 --> 2859.28
elaborate on

2856.8 --> 2860.079
use my skills on if nobody's going to do

2859.28 --> 2862.88
that

2860.079 --> 2865.599
then it's just going to be trolls hey if

2862.88 --> 2867.52
that's what everybody wants from me

2865.599 --> 2868.8
all that matters right well that's

2867.52 --> 2870.64
what's going to be left

2868.8 --> 2874.1600000000003
and then i don't know what's going to

2870.64 --> 2876.319
happen i'm getting a bit pissed off here

2874.16 --> 2877.839
right and also i don't want to ban

2876.319 --> 2881.68
people anymore

2877.839 --> 2885.68
if you don't like the trolls in my chat

2881.68 --> 2887.52
replace them with you you get active you

2885.68 --> 2890.72
do something better than just

2887.52 --> 2894.24
a bunch of stupid trolls in my chat you

2890.72 --> 2898.839
get in my chat you talk to me

2894.24 --> 2901.52
how about that bring me something worth

2898.839 --> 2915.839
mentioning

2901.52 --> 2915.839
let's talk about it how about that

2916.4 --> 2923.28
right yeah discussing ideas because

2920.24 --> 2925.1189999999997
everything else is all done right so if

2923.28 --> 2926.6400000000003
somebody's gonna make a silly claim

2925.119 --> 2928.8
about a

2926.64 --> 2931.1189999999997
very specific geometry concerning the

2928.8 --> 2933.8390000000004
earth then let's just work with it

2931.119 --> 2935.76
use the brain and just do it like does

2933.839 --> 2936.0
it even matter is it troll at this point

2935.76 --> 2939.2000000000003
i

2936.0 --> 2939.2
literally don't care

2941.68 --> 2945.9199999999996
go out that wrench yeah don't get too

2944.48 --> 2948.2400000000002
cocky on me

2945.92 --> 2948.2400000000002
dude

2950.16 --> 2956.24
i'm using you as an example

2953.68 --> 2956.7999999999997
to complain to others like yeah look

2956.24 --> 2959.359
you're

2956.8 --> 2960.88
the guy i'm going to end up talking with

2959.359 --> 2963.2
and have really silly

2960.88 --> 2964.2400000000002
discussions with because other people

2963.2 --> 2967.2
are not

2964.24 --> 2969.52
using me they're not utilizing me in

2967.2 --> 2970.5589999999997
this time that i have available for my

2969.52 --> 2972.88
viewers

2970.559 --> 2985.8390000000004
right so then it's just going to be

2972.88 --> 2985.839
oompa loompa

2997.28 --> 3001.76
a law of centrifuge what are you

2999.68 --> 3013.68
blabbering about

3001.76 --> 3017.6800000000003
gravity the gravity doesn't exist

3013.68 --> 3021.2
you can't just use gravity

3017.68 --> 3022.5589999999997
quickly in some kind of model

3021.2 --> 3027.1189999999997
that you're trying to construct

3022.559 --> 3029.44
virtually that doesn't work

3027.119 --> 3032.559
gravity doesn't even work on a ball

3029.44 --> 3034.559
where it is supposed to be the easiest

3032.559 --> 3036.3190000000004
right the geometry is the simplest you

3034.559 --> 3038.96
can just say r

3036.319 --> 3041.2799999999997
bend everything circular circular

3038.96 --> 3043.68
geometry so that is the easiest

3041.28 --> 3046.079
well in that setup gravity doesn't even

3043.68 --> 3050.5589999999997
work it makes no sense there is no

3046.079 --> 3054.559
conclusive geometry or

3050.559 --> 3057.76
phenomenon to it in physics

3054.559 --> 3060.559
doesn't work out right so yeah to then

3057.76 --> 3063.599
adapt gravity in a general sense to some

3060.559 --> 3069.8390000000004
other type of geometry that's just silly

3063.599 --> 3069.839
makes no sense

3088.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
you mean the rim velocity oompa loompa

3110.64 --> 3117.75
right so you're you're going by the uh

3114.64 --> 3117.75
[Music]

3117.92 --> 3124.7200000000003
call again damn it mobius ring

3121.28 --> 3128.4
so moby is ring clean right because

3124.72 --> 3131.68
if you have a hollow situation

3128.4 --> 3136.559
whatever spherical and you're gonna

3131.68 --> 3140.0
spin it guess what spin is on an axis

3136.559 --> 3142.079
so that means it only works in one way

3140.0 --> 3143.76
one direction the forces that are going

3142.079 --> 3145.6800000000003
to be

3143.76 --> 3149.2000000000003
unleashed because of that are going to

3145.68 --> 3152.0789999999997
be singular directional

3149.2 --> 3153.839
in relation to the axis of the spin so

3152.079 --> 3155.44
if you have some kind of a spherical

3153.839 --> 3159.359
setting that means that

3155.44 --> 3161.599
at the equator of this hollow sphere

3159.359 --> 3162.5589999999997
the forces are maximized and that the

3161.599 --> 3165.839
further you

3162.559 --> 3167.3590000000004
get toward the poles of the axis of the

3165.839 --> 3170.4
spin

3167.359 --> 3172.64
it's literally going to be experienced

3170.4 --> 3174.96
like you're climbing up a hill

3172.64 --> 3176.16
and a steep mountain and eventually like

3174.96 --> 3179.28
at a cliff because

3176.16 --> 3181.2799999999997
all that centrifugal force is all going

3179.28 --> 3183.44
to be bound by the axis

3181.28 --> 3185.52
now if you're going to assume it's

3183.44 --> 3187.04
strong enough to be like gravity

3185.52 --> 3189.119
then that means you're going to be

3187.04 --> 3195.839
constantly pushed towards

3189.119 --> 3195.839
the equator of that hollow sphere

3196.48 --> 3200.2400000000002
it's going to be pretty distinct so yeah

3199.04 --> 3204.079
if you could point me to

3200.24 --> 3205.5989999999997
that region in the world where it's just

3204.079 --> 3209.8390000000004
a giant cliff

3205.599 --> 3209.839
you're climbing up that would be great

3218.28 --> 3221.5890000000004
[Music]

3222.079 --> 3227.2000000000003
because if it was be it if it was some

3224.48 --> 3230.079
kind of a hollow sphere of some sort

3227.2 --> 3231.04
then that means that the north pole and

3230.079 --> 3233.92
the south port

3231.04 --> 3234.96
are effectively to our experience a

3233.92 --> 3237.6800000000003
giant

3234.96 --> 3239.52
infinite mountain they're like giant

3237.68 --> 3241.359
infinite mountains

3239.52 --> 3243.359
the further you go north and south the

3241.359 --> 3246.48
steeper it gets

3243.359 --> 3248.48
in a consistent fashion

3246.48 --> 3250.4
that's how you're going to be able to be

3248.48 --> 3253.119
experiencing it if

3250.4 --> 3255.44
it was all spitting which it isn't by

3253.119 --> 3255.44
the way

3263.119 --> 3266.1600000000003
in a big world you notice not notice

3265.2 --> 3269.4399999999996
that no

3266.16 --> 3273.359
you would you absolutely would at

3269.44 --> 3273.359
all times that's the whole point

3273.839 --> 3280.72
if grav yeah the supposed gravity

3277.52 --> 3283.28
the reason to stick to the surface

3280.72 --> 3285.2799999999997
if it if it would be purely due to this

3283.28 --> 3288.1600000000003
centrifugal force

3285.28 --> 3288.96
then there would be nothing to make you

3288.16 --> 3291.52
stick

3288.96 --> 3293.2
to the north and the south south pole of

3291.52 --> 3298.16
that hollow sphere spinning

3293.2 --> 3300.5589999999997
nothing there is no centrifugal force

3298.16 --> 3300.5589999999997
going

3301.52 --> 3308.72
on to the axis in those directions it's

3304.839 --> 3312.319
only around the axis

3308.72 --> 3315.2
those directions like a tube

3312.319 --> 3316.96
so yeah it would absolutely be

3315.2 --> 3318.72
experienced as a giant

3316.96 --> 3320.2400000000002
infinite cliff that gets deeper and

3318.72 --> 3335.839
steeper to the north and south

3320.24 --> 3335.839
absolutely it would

3340.4 --> 3346.839
the poles would be light and now you're

3343.119 --> 3349.839
just winging it this is getting kind of

3346.839 --> 3349.839
lame

3371.599 --> 3377.2000000000003
you are just not understand no no i

3374.799 --> 3378.72
am understanding i'm understanding

3377.2 --> 3383.359
modeling better than

3378.72 --> 3383.359
anybody i know in the freaking world

3386.079 --> 3390.96
and yeah by the way that idea doesn't

3389.119 --> 3394.799
mean [ __ ]

3390.96 --> 3394.799
doesn't make me more valuable

3398.319 --> 3403.359
unless you really want to understand how

3400.24 --> 3419.839
these mechanics works

3403.359 --> 3419.839
now these mechanics work damn smelly

3434.4 --> 3438.799
right so simply to assume some kind of a

3438.16 --> 3442.0
sphere

3438.799 --> 3442.96
hollow sphere in a literal geometrical

3442.0 --> 3445.28
sense

3442.96 --> 3448.16
it's it's completely futile that's not

3445.28 --> 3448.1600000000003
what the earth is

3448.4 --> 3453.92
like it cannot be

3451.76 --> 3456.6400000000003
it's not how this works you can't just

3453.92 --> 3458.839
fantasize things into reality

3456.64 --> 3461.839
and then not think about why it can't

3458.839 --> 3461.839
work

3463.359 --> 3467.119
hey roger good to see you

3469.04 --> 3475.839
and by the way also cameron kamikaze

3472.839 --> 3475.839
gilmore

3497.76 --> 3503.8390000000004
no it does are you a freaking concave

3504.0 --> 3508.559
because i will make you the first person

3506.079 --> 3511.3590000000004
to get kicked

3508.559 --> 3512.4
if you're gonna disgustingly try to

3511.359 --> 3516.0789999999997
sneak in your

3512.4 --> 3517.119
[ __ ] concave [ __ ] i will kick you

3516.079 --> 3521.599
out

3517.119 --> 3521.599
it's not concave

3524.799 --> 3531.2
hollow hollow sphere earth is not

3528.079 --> 3534.4
a hollow sphere earth is not a

3531.2 --> 3545.839
hollow sphere earth is not

3534.4 --> 3545.839
a hollow sphere

3561.359 --> 3566.48
i'm rude i'm just pissed off

3566.72 --> 3571.5989999999997
oh convince you let me convince you

3569.76 --> 3573.5200000000004
right here yeah you're the first person

3571.599 --> 3576.6400000000003
to get banned get the [ __ ] out

3573.52 --> 3579.359
i'm not convincing anybody i don't give

3576.64 --> 3579.359
a [ __ ]

3579.92 --> 3583.52
i was just [ __ ] around

3583.68 --> 3588.8799999999997
you were there communicating then you

3586.64 --> 3591.5989999999997
got all tomfoolery

3588.88 --> 3593.119
i tried to get serious and now you're

3591.599 --> 3596.6400000000003
being a complainy pants

3593.119 --> 3596.6400000000003
yeah well get the [ __ ] out

3596.72 --> 3601.9199999999996
probably a liar too first time you got

3599.68 --> 3607.68
on this show get the [ __ ] out here

3601.92 --> 3615.839
[ __ ] bull [ __ ] you're a liar

3607.68 --> 3615.839
[ __ ] off

3621.359 --> 3629.839
so anybody else

3657.599 --> 3662.88
oh thank you zack that's the best show

3660.88 --> 3665.6800000000003
on

3662.88 --> 3667.359
i don't know how to interpret that in

3665.68 --> 3669.5989999999997
english

3667.359 --> 3673.2
but since you say best show i think

3669.599 --> 3673.2000000000003
that's supposed to be a compliment

3676.48 --> 3679.68
i don't think i'm the best show though

3678.559 --> 3682.1600000000003
at all

3679.68 --> 3682.96
like not even close i think actually

3682.16 --> 3685.7599999999998
that

3682.96 --> 3686.96
even though i guess watching me is kind

3685.76 --> 3690.1600000000003
of amusing in

3686.96 --> 3694.319
multiple different types of ways my show

3690.16 --> 3694.319
is anything but the best show out there

3697.359 --> 3701.68
if anything my entire thing is more like

3699.68 --> 3703.9199999999996
a reality show

3701.68 --> 3706.24
well that's no that would be completely

3703.92 --> 3709.92
off by now because all reality shows are

3706.24 --> 3713.839
exactly the opposite of reality

3709.92 --> 3713.839
but it's more like just a

3715.2 --> 3719.2
open video profile of a person that's

3718.319 --> 3726.64
what it is

3719.2 --> 3730.5589999999997
more than a show really

3726.64 --> 3730.5589999999997
because yeah i don't know

3731.039 --> 3736.079
i'm open to new people though new people

3733.44 --> 3738.88
getting on the scene

3736.079 --> 3739.44
if you still want to associate with me

3738.88 --> 3742.799
because

3739.44 --> 3745.359
i don't know man i have bad mood

3742.799 --> 3749.119
sometimes

3745.359 --> 3753.0389999999998
and yeah guess what got a new

3749.119 --> 3753.039
oh damn it what happened here

3753.599 --> 3759.6800000000003
but my landlord complained

making up excuses to try and make you

3792.88 --> 3796.6400000000003

3798.64 --> 3803.5989999999997
he thought you please move the [ __ ] out

3801.359 --> 3805.44
that was what he was basically saying he

3803.599 --> 3808.0
knows he can't make me

3805.44 --> 3808.48
so yeah that makes me feel very happy

3808.0 --> 3811.839

3808.48 --> 3814.799
welcome once again in the world

3811.839 --> 3815.92

anymore for some reason

3823.2 --> 3826.799

[Music]

3840.24 --> 3847.2799999999997
but yeah this chat interaction

3843.52 --> 3847.68
it's too unstable and if it's going to

3847.28 --> 3851.039
stay

3847.68 --> 3852.24
too unstable then i'm going to literally

3851.039 --> 3854.2400000000002
cut it out and

3852.24 --> 3855.359
at some point choose not to interact

3854.24 --> 3858.319
with my chat anymore

3855.359 --> 3860.319
completely you know why because i can't

3858.319 --> 3861.92
rely on that

3860.319 --> 3864.16
because you get silent moments i get

3861.92 --> 3864.799
pissed off you get a troll wasting my

3864.16 --> 3869.7599999999998
time

3864.799 --> 3871.599
then a vacuum and yeah

3869.76 --> 3873.6800000000003
at this point i wouldn't want to be

3871.599 --> 3876.799
watching this right

3873.68 --> 3876.799
so that's not good

3876.88 --> 3884.559
so yeah i don't know if this is helping

3881.839 --> 3885.7599999999998
pushing around some people that might be

3884.559 --> 3889.3590000000004
listening

3885.76 --> 3892.4
like come on guys

3889.359 --> 3893.5989999999997
is it just listen to arwen in the

3892.4 --> 3897.28
background

3893.599 --> 3897.839
it's kind of amusing just to get through

3897.28 --> 3900.48
the day

3897.839 --> 3901.359
right well i don't need that i don't

3900.48 --> 3903.839
need that

3901.359 --> 3903.839
at all

3906.559 --> 3913.599
i need interaction i need people's minds

3909.76 --> 3917.119
activated and engaging

3913.599 --> 3920.6400000000003
so that i can work together with them

3917.119 --> 3923.839
and figure things out and yeah

3920.64 --> 3927.0389999999998
get some energy back

3923.839 --> 3928.64
too in that process you know because

3927.039 --> 3930.96
when people engage

3928.64 --> 3932.799
feels a lot better for me and people

3930.96 --> 3935.44
don't engage and just sit back in the

3932.799 --> 3937.7599999999998
background do absolutely nothing

3935.44 --> 3949.9900000000002
it makes me feel like i'm wasting my

getting rushed there are these things

3969.76 --> 3975.119
yes great is a great moment for this

3972.88 --> 3977.2000000000003
especially since i don't have silver

thousands of euros of silver it's all

even though that is exactly what i

wanted to do originally

3993.359 --> 3997.119
and then it all just tanked and i lost

3995.52 --> 4000.24

4056.88 --> 4063.839
that's okay

that i am

4068.0 --> 4072.24
i have times where i just endlessly

you guys do it's like ah he's blabbering

sometimes i'm exactly the opposite

4098.239 --> 4105.199
like i'm trying to find a way through

because all that information from what

is happening out there

4107.12 --> 4113.839
like it sets a tone but it's all

4110.4 --> 4115.04

get you concerned about it spending time

on it

sometimes not towards people just with

4912.0 --> 4916.4
himself or whatever

4913.12 --> 4918.719
loud it's so it's so annoying

4916.4 --> 4919.759999999999
it's so annoying when he gets like that

4918.719 --> 4922.56
and we're

4919.76 --> 4926.400000000001
worried about him like why aren't you

4922.56 --> 4928.88
going to a psychiatrist to have yourself

4926.4 --> 4931.199
mentally mutilated somehow like why

4928.88 --> 4932.400000000001
don't you do the surgical procedure to

4931.199 --> 4936.719
get that anger

4932.4 --> 4939.679
out of you so you're not angry anymore

4936.719 --> 4942.4800000000005
so we can just treat you like a normal

4939.679 --> 4943.52
drone like every [ __ ] body else out

4942.48 --> 4946.959999999999

4943.52 --> 4948.320000000001
right there's people here that think

4946.96 --> 4951.28
like this

4948.32 --> 4952.32
they don't say it i can see it on them

4951.28 --> 4955.04
they don't know

4952.32 --> 4957.28
how to deal with this element with

4955.04 --> 4959.44
actual expression of

4957.28 --> 4960.96
genuine dissatisfaction with the world

4959.44 --> 4963.44
they don't know how to deal with it

4960.96 --> 4964.0
they're like no it's a problem that must

4963.44 --> 4966.719
be

4964.0 --> 4967.92
getting out of the way so he's no longer

4966.719 --> 4969.84
angry anymore

4967.92 --> 4971.36
yeah it's not gonna [ __ ] happen until

4969.84 --> 4973.92
i die

4971.36 --> 4975.36
i don't see it stopping it comes back

4973.92 --> 4977.92
every time because i

4975.36 --> 4981.12
am because i have feelings and have

4977.92 --> 4984.84
feelings toward the world so unless i

4981.12 --> 4987.599999999999
render myself into an unemotional

4984.84 --> 4988.32
whatever whatever the [ __ ] is left of

4987.6 --> 4989.679
that

4988.32 --> 4992.5599999999995
wouldn't even be able to call it a

4989.679 --> 4994.88
psychopath yeah unless i do that

4992.56 --> 4996.320000000001
i'm going to be like this i am going to

4994.88 --> 4998.08
get pissed off

4996.32 --> 5000.08
i'm going to express that i'm not going

4998.08 --> 5004.4
to be convenient and nice

5000.08 --> 5007.44
and adapted to every [ __ ] moment

5004.4 --> 5009.44
out there that's right

5007.44 --> 5011.678999999999
yeah and i'm not very happy about it to

5009.44 --> 5014.719
realize once again

5011.679 --> 5018.08
that people are complaining to my

5014.719 --> 5022.159
[ __ ] landlord and not to my face

5018.08 --> 5025.199
because they're [ __ ] they're scared

5022.159 --> 5027.04
little [ __ ] and they

5025.199 --> 5029.199
don't have the balls to walk up to me

5027.04 --> 5032.239
and just say like dude

5029.199 --> 5035.199
are you all right or whatever and then

5032.239 --> 5037.44
see me in the moment snap out of it when

5035.199 --> 5038.96
i realize oh [ __ ] you were

5037.44 --> 5040.96
you were bothered by that i didn't

5038.96 --> 5042.4800000000005
realize that i'm sorry

5040.96 --> 5045.12
i didn't mean it like that didn't mean

5042.48 --> 5046.799999999999
to bother you it's just i get very

5045.12 --> 5050.239
frustrated sometimes

5046.8 --> 5051.92
or maybe they just stop caring they

5050.239 --> 5053.759999999999
they just don't care they don't want to

5051.92 --> 5056.96
think about

5053.76 --> 5058.4800000000005
it whatever it is in the moment or

5056.96 --> 5060.32
i don't know maybe they're very

5058.48 --> 5062.879999999999
sensitive very

5060.32 --> 5065.04
very sensitive and then if they hear one

5062.88 --> 5067.4400000000005
angry screaming oh it all comes

5065.04 --> 5069.12
back from the past or something whatever

5067.44 --> 5071.599999999999
the [ __ ] they've been through

5069.12 --> 5072.639
i don't even know they're not telling me

5071.6 --> 5075.360000000001
probably hiding it

5072.639 --> 5075.36
for everyone

5121.52 --> 5127.6
successful

5122.4 --> 5129.839999999999
exploit in my lifetime do you understand

5127.6 --> 5133.280000000001

5129.84 --> 5137.28
financial exploit in my lifetime

5133.28 --> 5141.12
by far by far measured biggest

5137.28 --> 5146.4
brutal income that i've ever had

5141.12 --> 5146.4

that i do the way the things i do it the

5171.04 --> 5175.12
way that i do it

yeah go ahead

5194.8 --> 5201.679
do it you [ __ ] hear it

5197.92 --> 5205.679
do it [ __ ] do it then

5201.679 --> 5210.88
you [ __ ] troll piece of [ __ ] go ahead

5205.679 --> 5215.28
do it think you got power

5210.88 --> 5218.8
go ahead use your power abuse it

5215.28 --> 5219.199
use your your connections with the world

5218.8 --> 5222.639
the

5219.199 --> 5239.839999999999
the willingly stupid world

5222.639 --> 5239.84
get me man go ahead then [ __ ] do it

5254.639 --> 5260.0
yeah that's really cute from 400 views

5257.679 --> 5262.8
i've never had 400 views like that it's

5260.0 --> 5264.84
only very rare that i have that

5262.8 --> 5267.76
but overall the numbers have been pretty

5264.84 --> 5270.8
stable

5267.76 --> 5272.8
it's always around 200 sometimes a

5270.8 --> 5274.96
little more but yeah over time it builds

5272.8 --> 5274.96
up

5276.48 --> 5280.32
and i've had some pretty cool streams

5278.719 --> 5283.6
where it got a little big

5280.32 --> 5286.159
like over 300 or 400 even

5283.6 --> 5286.88
but on average no no my amounts of views

5286.159 --> 5290.4
has been

5286.88 --> 5293.6
eerily consistent around 200 views

5290.4 --> 5294.5599999999995
go into my video playlist and scroll

5293.6 --> 5297.04
down

5294.56 --> 5299.6
and see that it's all extremely

5297.04 --> 5302.239
persistent which is illogical

5299.6 --> 5303.120000000001
because there should be more views

5302.239 --> 5308.879999999999
especially

5303.12 --> 5311.92
back but doesn't seem to be happening

5308.88 --> 5312.639
so no it's all [ __ ] oh i'm failing

5311.92 --> 5316.08
oh

5312.639 --> 5316.88
quickly pile onto his bad confidence

5316.08 --> 5319.44
because

5316.88 --> 5321.1990000000005
if we just convince him that doing this

5319.44 --> 5324.239
is making everybody

5321.199 --> 5325.919999999999
hate him that they'll all walk away then

5324.239 --> 5328.4
maybe we could make it worse maybe we

5325.92 --> 5331.6
could actually make him stop

5328.4 --> 5333.759999999999
ah guess what i'm not gonna stop

5331.6 --> 5335.280000000001
i'm just gonna make it worse for you

5333.76 --> 5336.88
because i pick up

5335.28 --> 5340.4
on these things whether you say it or

5336.88 --> 5343.1990000000005
not and then i'm just gonna

5340.4 --> 5344.239
make the pain even worse for you little

5343.199 --> 5351.839999999999
[ __ ]

5344.239 --> 5351.839999999999
i'm gonna make it worse for you yeah

5357.75 --> 5362.639
[Music]

5359.52 --> 5365.1990000000005
right for example let's just talk about

5362.639 --> 5367.6
flat earth again

5365.199 --> 5369.839999999999
you know reality that the earth is

5367.6 --> 5373.120000000001
actually flat for example

5369.84 --> 5373.12
let's just squeeze that one

5374.639 --> 5380.2390000000005
yeah did you know the earth is flat

5378.159 --> 5381.36
that there is no outer space that there

5380.239 --> 5385.36
is a very

5381.36 --> 5388.0
limited amount of volume in this realm

5385.36 --> 5389.599999999999
compared to what heliocentrism suggests

5388.0 --> 5392.8
did you know that

5389.6 --> 5393.76
did you know it's all a lie you were

5392.8 --> 5398.8
raised in it

5393.76 --> 5398.8
and that your mind even is partially

5399.36 --> 5404.159
or the other way around like this lie

5401.92 --> 5406.159
has been specifically designed for our

5404.159 --> 5408.638999999999
minds to latch onto

5406.159 --> 5409.5199999999995
it's like a spell that has been tinker

5408.639 --> 5412.8
tailored

5409.52 --> 5416.4800000000005
to our spirits yeah it's

5412.8 --> 5417.92
really brutal it's very very dark in a

5416.48 --> 5420.0
way

5417.92 --> 5421.1990000000005
especially at first when you snap out of

5420.0 --> 5424.239
it and realize that it's

5421.199 --> 5425.44
terrible it's literally like your world

5424.239 --> 5427.919999999999
crumbles

5425.44 --> 5428.5599999999995
everything not just a physical thing

5427.92 --> 5431.84
spirit

5428.56 --> 5433.280000000001
all of it it crumbles torn apart it's

5431.84 --> 5436.400000000001
terrible sensation

5433.28 --> 5438.8
painful so painful that some people even

5436.4 --> 5440.5599999999995
consider it like saying that the

5438.8 --> 5440.96
holocaust wasn't real or something which

5440.56 --> 5443.04
this

5440.96 --> 5444.639
whole group of people is like the

5443.04 --> 5448.08
ultimate evil

5444.639 --> 5451.52
to say something like that right

5448.08 --> 5453.5199999999995
so yeah it's [ __ ] true though

5451.52 --> 5456.0
because the earth isn't a globe in outer

5453.52 --> 5457.679
space it cannot be it's a physical

5456.0 --> 5461.44
impossibility

5457.679 --> 5464.4
you're just too caught up in the fray

5461.44 --> 5467.28
you trusted that oh no it's worked out

5464.4 --> 5469.12
somebody has confirmed this story to me

5467.28 --> 5471.12
because it's being said so many times

5469.12 --> 5472.0
it's being said everywhere so it must

5471.12 --> 5475.36
then be

5472.0 --> 5479.12
true it can't be not true

5475.36 --> 5480.799999999999
if everybody's saying it yeah

5479.12 --> 5483.28
yeah yeah that's what happened to you

5480.8 --> 5485.12
that's what happened to all of us

5483.28 --> 5486.96
but in reality it's a physical

5485.12 --> 5490.4
impossibility and as soon as you

5486.96 --> 5492.639
figure that out then the

5490.4 --> 5495.92
bizarreness of the whole situation

5492.639 --> 5495.92
really piles on

5496.48 --> 5501.36
because you believed it so

5502.159 --> 5508.4
yeah the earth is flat it's not a sphere

5505.04 --> 5508.4
there's no geometry

5509.12 --> 5516.84
like that the geometrical orientation

5514.08 --> 5518.0
of the earth's surface is as good as

5516.84 --> 5521.679
flat

5518.0 --> 5521.679
very very flat

5521.84 --> 5525.4400000000005
it's flat enough to absolutely in a

5524.159 --> 5529.679
geometrical sense

5525.44 --> 5532.719
never add up to some kind of

5529.679 --> 5535.1990000000005
sphere based geometry in any sort of way

5532.719 --> 5537.12
it's impossible it's not a sphere and

5535.199 --> 5538.879999999999
it's in a contained realm it has to be

5537.12 --> 5541.76
because we have gas pressure and

5538.88 --> 5543.92
gas goes in all directions into the

5541.76 --> 5546.320000000001
available volume

5543.92 --> 5548.4800000000005
and then yeah there may be some kind of

5546.32 --> 5551.199
secondary effects

5548.48 --> 5554.239
once the gas pressure has filmed filled

5551.199 --> 5556.32
the available volume of the container

5554.239 --> 5557.44
then yeah secondary effects happen

5556.32 --> 5559.12
whatever that is

5557.44 --> 5561.12
however that's caused that that's a

5559.12 --> 5562.88
whole nother discussion the gradient may

5561.12 --> 5564.639
set in right

5562.88 --> 5565.92
but that gradient is always going to be

5564.639 --> 5569.36
in relation

5565.92 --> 5569.92
it's gonna form specifically the pattern

5569.36 --> 5574.48
of it

5569.92 --> 5577.6
in relation to the container size

5574.48 --> 5578.48
gradated over the container it's just

5577.6 --> 5582.4800000000005
like

5578.48 --> 5585.599999999999
color palette like say a color palette

5582.48 --> 5587.599999999999
it's from this color to that color if

5585.6 --> 5590.08
the total surface in which

5587.6 --> 5590.88
the pallet is is bigger then the color

5590.08 --> 5593.76
is going to be

5590.88 --> 5595.28
more gradually divided over it that's

5593.76 --> 5596.8
the grid that's a gradient that's a

5595.28 --> 5598.719
color gradient in this case

5596.8 --> 5601.6
guess what works the same for gas

5598.719 --> 5604.719
pressure in a dynamic system

5601.6 --> 5607.4400000000005
in the container of the realm

5604.719 --> 5608.08
so there's just this gradient that

5607.44 --> 5611.919999999999
gradient

5608.08 --> 5615.12
cannot be just this micro

5611.92 --> 5617.679
micro little thing on the edge of

5615.12 --> 5618.239
an infinite sized palette that's a

5617.679 --> 5621.6
physical

5618.239 --> 5622.159
possibility no matter how you work it

5621.6 --> 5625.04
out

5622.159 --> 5627.44
cannot be calculated cannot be

5625.04 --> 5630.719
demonstrated

5627.44 --> 5632.4
it's no realistic mathematical

5630.719 --> 5635.679
possibility even

5632.4 --> 5638.32
to conjure forth this concept

5635.679 --> 5639.28
because gas pressure expands with as

5638.32 --> 5643.28
much power

5639.28 --> 5646.32
as the available volume there is

5643.28 --> 5650.4
so if the available volume is infinite

5646.32 --> 5652.4
then it'll explode with infinite power

5650.4 --> 5654.5599999999995
to spread around and never settle

5652.4 --> 5655.679
because the volume is infinite so there

5654.56 --> 5657.76
could never be

5655.679 --> 5658.8
a gradient of gas pressure under any

5657.76 --> 5661.04
circumstance

5658.8 --> 5662.4800000000005
if gas pressure expansion power is

5661.04 --> 5664.48
infinite and will never

5662.48 --> 5666.08
settle because the volume is infinite

5664.48 --> 5671.36
but all these things

5666.08 --> 5675.36
are just people don't go there anymore

5671.36 --> 5677.599999999999
because what do you do when you're left

5675.36 --> 5678.5599999999995
with a world that's gonna persist a

5677.6 --> 5680.719
completely

5678.56 --> 5681.76
faked out story anyway it's punishing

5680.719 --> 5684.08
it's punishing

5681.76 --> 5685.52
when you're constantly being hammered

5684.08 --> 5688.88
with stupidity

5685.52 --> 5690.4800000000005
this is the biggest problem with being

5688.88 --> 5692.88
actually smart

5690.48 --> 5694.239
is that you're the smarter you get the

5692.88 --> 5697.36
wiser you get even

5694.239 --> 5700.32
the more you're going to be

5697.36 --> 5701.44
surrounded even if just at a distance

5700.32 --> 5704.96
with stupidity

5701.44 --> 5708.4
the stupidity will reveal itself

5704.96 --> 5711.92
around you as you grow smarter

5708.4 --> 5716.799999999999
right becomes a personal

5711.92 --> 5716.8
problem of the person facing the world

5720.61 --> 5726.48
[Music]

5721.76 --> 5729.360000000001
we don't really know yet what gravity

5726.48 --> 5731.36
yeah gravity is not a force for starters

5729.36 --> 5732.32
and even if it was a force with the

5731.36 --> 5735.36
amount of

5732.32 --> 5737.599999999999
force power that it is suggested to have

5735.36 --> 5742.239
throughout history

5737.6 --> 5744.08
how does a little bit of a weak force

5742.239 --> 5745.839999999999
without a container right of force just

5744.08 --> 5746.5599999999995
push a slight push how is that going to

5745.84 --> 5749.679
stop the

5746.56 --> 5752.88
infinite expansion force

5749.679 --> 5755.6
powers of gas as

5752.88 --> 5756.719
it tries to expand within the available

5755.6 --> 5759.04
container which

5756.719 --> 5760.8
well is claimed to be infinite how is

5759.04 --> 5764.4
that going to match up against it

5760.8 --> 5765.4400000000005
it's not it's not even going to have any

5764.4 --> 5768.48
influence

5765.44 --> 5771.599999999999
whatsoever because a little influence

5768.48 --> 5773.678999999999
versus infinity yeah it doesn't really

5771.6 --> 5776.159000000001
size up

5773.679 --> 5778.56
the little amount just literally falls

5776.159 --> 5779.759999999999
away into absolutely nothing in the face

5778.56 --> 5785.84
of infinity

5779.76 --> 5785.84
so yeah there you go it's impossible

5787.76 --> 5792.320000000001
how do you explain is always falling

5789.84 --> 5796.88
down relative density

5792.32 --> 5799.759999999999
whatever is present within the container

5796.88 --> 5800.159000000001
is being divided up through dense and

5799.76 --> 5803.4400000000005
less

5800.159 --> 5806.799999999999
dense and this

5803.44 --> 5808.799999999999
is expressed in relative density so the

5806.8 --> 5812.08
dense

5808.8 --> 5815.04
if it is denser than the medium it is in

5812.08 --> 5815.44
will always go down and if it is less

5815.04 --> 5818.56
dense

5815.44 --> 5819.28
it will go up unless it just goes in all

5818.56 --> 5821.4400000000005
directions

5819.28 --> 5823.04
but it will have an upward bias if it is

5821.44 --> 5824.879999999999
less dense than the medium it that

5823.04 --> 5826.8
surrounds it

5824.88 --> 5828.400000000001
and if it is denser than the medium it

5826.8 --> 5831.4400000000005
surrounds

5828.4 --> 5841.839999999999
that surrounds it then it will go down

5831.44 --> 5841.839999999999
so yeah i'll be back in two minutes

5866.84 --> 5869.84
so

5894.84 --> 5897.84
so

5922.84 --> 5925.84
so

5937.199 --> 5942.08
four directions of falling what the [ __ ]

5943.52 --> 5950.84
there's no four directions of falling

5947.6 --> 5953.84
a which piece of [ __ ] exactly dutch

5950.84 --> 5953.84
sailor

5969.44 --> 5975.599999999999
what the [ __ ] are you not

5973.36 --> 5977.04
still enslaved in the world to people

5975.6 --> 5978.96
what the [ __ ]

5977.04 --> 5981.84
that just leave him be i think he's just

5978.96 --> 5981.84
squirting

5985.76 --> 5989.76
yeah yeah do it

5989.84 --> 5994.2390000000005
why don't you read what you just said

5992.639 --> 6009.84
right there and apply it

5994.239 --> 6009.839999999999
it is time to wake up just go ahead

6013.88 --> 6017.029
[Music]

6071.92 --> 6076.4
not everything is forced down tighter

6073.84 --> 6076.400000000001
left blank

6076.8 --> 6080.719
it's only things that are more dense

6079.36 --> 6083.119
than the medium they're in

6080.719 --> 6083.92
they're forced down how does this happen

6083.119 --> 6087.48
it does

6083.92 --> 6090.4
provably i've called it relative density

6087.48 --> 6092.799999999999
disequilibrium force

6090.4 --> 6095.04
so depending on the differential between

6092.8 --> 6098.0
the density of the object and the medium

6095.04 --> 6098.32
an average density of object there will

6098.0 --> 6100.8
be

6098.32 --> 6102.799999999999
a force applied this can be calculated

6100.8 --> 6103.6
i've never bothered to do this because i

6102.8 --> 6107.1990000000005
don't give a

6103.6 --> 6110.8
[ __ ] about math at all

6107.199 --> 6111.36
like others can if they want i know it's

6110.8 --> 6115.04
there

6111.36 --> 6117.28
i just don't care i just know it's there

6115.04 --> 6120.239
and i don't care

6117.28 --> 6122.48
all i care about is that i know that it

6120.239 --> 6125.599999999999
works

6122.48 --> 6127.36
density the object density of the medium

6125.6 --> 6129.280000000001
there's a differential between it and

6127.36 --> 6132.96
this differential will determine how

6129.28 --> 6136.4
much force and in what direction

6132.96 --> 6136.4
among the axes

6144.08 --> 6149.84
yes dutch sailor i i think it's safe to

6147.44 --> 6149.839999999999
say yes

6154.8 --> 6157.1990000000005
dude

6159.84 --> 6165.119000000001
that's not the way to go about dutch

6162.4 --> 6167.04
sailor but

6165.119 --> 6169.5199999999995
it didn't exactly give you permission to

6167.04 --> 6169.5199999999995
do that

6169.6 --> 6177.84
but he is kind of an ass i agree

6180.4 --> 6183.44
why does a football in the air not go up

6183.04 --> 6186.88
well

6183.44 --> 6186.879999999999
because the football is not

6187.28 --> 6190.4
less dense than the air that surrounds

6189.44 --> 6205.839999999999
it

6190.4 --> 6205.839999999999
it's not that difficult eliminator

6207.67 --> 6211.209
[Music]

6228.159 --> 6235.92
yeah j you

6232.159 --> 6235.92
don't get too cocky about that

6236.159 --> 6240.0
i might just ban you for saying that

6240.08 --> 6247.5199999999995
because the thing is friends

6243.199 --> 6250.32
whatever man chat participants

6247.52 --> 6250.320000000001
is it friends

6251.6 --> 6258.8
some of you are but i'm not really

6255.76 --> 6260.719
looking for new people on the internet

6258.8 --> 6263.679
to be friends with i'd rather be find

6260.719 --> 6265.92
some actual people out there

6263.679 --> 6275.84
that i can respect i hope to meet one

6265.92 --> 6275.84
one day

6287.36 --> 6291.5199999999995
less banning more for cat participation

6289.6 --> 6293.6
oakley gets it yeah yeah

6291.52 --> 6297.119000000001
the thing is though if it gets too messy

6293.6 --> 6297.119000000001
then eventually

6297.76 --> 6302.400000000001
people stop watching if they can again

6299.679 --> 6306.0
that's not entirely true though

6302.4 --> 6306.0
that's not true you

6310.32 --> 6314.32
there's still plenty of people following

6312.239 --> 6315.199
me that had been banned that say yeah

6314.32 --> 6318.239
i've

6315.199 --> 6321.599999999999
been banned for like a year

6318.239 --> 6323.5199999999995
i'm still watching so it's not

6321.6 --> 6324.88
necessarily true i think a lot more

6323.52 --> 6327.4400000000005
people watch this than

6324.88 --> 6329.36
participate in the chat but it comes and

6327.44 --> 6330.0
goes sometimes there's a lot of people

6329.36 --> 6333.44
in chat with

6330.0 --> 6334.96
a lot of interesting insights and

6333.44 --> 6345.839999999999
feedback and

6334.96 --> 6345.84
news and the other times not so much

6366.719 --> 6373.84
all right yeah member chat system right

6374.159 --> 6387.839999999999
but you could also just become a member

6405.92 --> 6413.36
makes me look stronger as a person wow

6410.08 --> 6415.36
okay fine yeah well that's fine then

6413.36 --> 6416.5599999999995
everybody can just puke all over me

6415.36 --> 6419.839999999999
constantly

6416.56 --> 6423.04
that's fine just do it just

6419.84 --> 6424.719
share your pain make me look the worst

6423.04 --> 6426.719
you can imagine

6424.719 --> 6428.4800000000005
it's not gonna stop me though nothing

6426.719 --> 6430.0
has really stopped me

6428.48 --> 6433.759999999999
you know you gotta realize that i'm

6430.0 --> 6433.76
still here doing this freaking show

6435.28 --> 6446.639
i'm still doing this show so

6442.639 --> 6446.639
and sometimes i just ban people

6447.199 --> 6450.32
to discipline them

6452.639 --> 6455.84
even though yeah not a lot of that is

6454.56 --> 6458.4800000000005
going to affect be

6455.84 --> 6460.2390000000005
effective on the long run because a lot

6458.48 --> 6464.4
of people

6460.239 --> 6464.4
out there in chats are just

6465.679 --> 6470.96
they're a mess a lot of people are a

6469.119 --> 6473.5199999999995
mess

6470.96 --> 6476.32
if not just most most people are a

6473.52 --> 6476.320000000001
complete mess

6477.04 --> 6483.84
they're just working out

6480.32 --> 6486.159
how to somehow be still a human being

6483.84 --> 6486.159000000001
enough

6487.92 --> 6499.84
and i seem to be getting a lot of that

6504.56 --> 6510.320000000001
oh get the [ __ ] out of here you goddamn

6507.76 --> 6510.320000000001
[ __ ]

6510.4 --> 6513.839999999999
what an [ __ ]

6525.83 --> 6528.93
[Music]

6534.639 --> 6542.32
yeah it never really does

6538.639 --> 6546.88
touch sailor timeout look timeouts don't

6542.32 --> 6546.88
work really and it's just to keep them

6552.84 --> 6555.84
away

6557.599 --> 6560.88
hair down r1d yeah i do that more often

6560.48 --> 6564.4
it's

6560.88 --> 6564.400000000001
a little better for my hair too

6565.84 --> 6569.84
what are you talking about

6569.92 --> 6573.4400000000005
only 40 that's normal

6574.96 --> 6582.56
game over what are you whining about

6578.639 --> 6584.08
it's like what why it's what's the

6582.56 --> 6587.52
problem here

6584.08 --> 6590.8
42 is not bad i've seen worse

6587.52 --> 6594.56
i see a lot of other streamers out there

6590.8 --> 6596.159000000001
that don't get those numbers

6594.56 --> 6598.4800000000005
so i don't know what you're complaining

6596.159 --> 6598.48
about

6600.159 --> 6607.598999999999
i mean it's not record right but i'm not

6603.44 --> 6610.239
really talking about a very

6607.599 --> 6611.76
attention drawing specific subject like

6610.239 --> 6614.638999999999
if i would be doing like an

6611.76 --> 6614.96
elaborate presentation with technicals

6614.639 --> 6617.04
and

6614.96 --> 6620.56
pictures yeah it'll probably get a lot

6617.04 --> 6624.88
more oh look it's 45 now

6620.56 --> 6627.92
all right

6624.88 --> 6628.96
all right see you later roger it's not

6627.92 --> 6632.719
good

6628.96 --> 6632.719
yeah well then it's not good

6634.08 --> 6639.28
like if there were five people watching

6636.48 --> 6641.04
i'd still do it

6639.28 --> 6644.32
as long as those five people are

6641.04 --> 6644.32
actually cool people

6644.719 --> 6653.84
that i can interact with in a great way

6654.48 --> 6660.239
40 is pretty good for me yeah well

6657.599 --> 6663.28
i've had better i've had like a 200

6660.239 --> 6663.28
views at one point

6664.56 --> 6667.84
yeah i do get a 100 dislikes yeah

6666.719 --> 6669.679
sometimes

6667.84 --> 6672.96
not always though it depends on if

6669.679 --> 6672.96
they're in a mood to do that

6673.679 --> 6679.04
because hey as a baller

6676.96 --> 6681.199
if you don't abuse power then what's the

6679.04 --> 6682.8
point right

6681.199 --> 6685.04
it's all about the peer pressure you're

6682.8 --> 6687.360000000001
not going to get you're not going to win

6685.04 --> 6690.639
the argument so you might just as well

6687.36 --> 6693.36
use your peer pressure and

6690.639 --> 6694.400000000001
appointed authority as a globe religious

6693.36 --> 6697.759999999999
seller to

6694.4 --> 6700.4
abuse powers to yeah make people that

6697.76 --> 6703.679
disagree with the consensus is miserable

6700.4 --> 6707.119
right that's what you do right

6703.679 --> 6708.719
go ahead i don't give a [ __ ] i mean it

6707.119 --> 6712.5599999999995
does piss me off a little

6708.719 --> 6712.56
but i'm not it's not gonna stop me

6720.84 --> 6727.1990000000005
though

6723.52 --> 6727.1990000000005
how do you explain satellites

6728.239 --> 6731.919999999999
what do i explain about them

6733.84 --> 6737.119000000001
satellites are a fictional construct

6736.08 --> 6740.159
there's no

6737.119 --> 6742.08
things floating up there

6740.159 --> 6744.4
there might be some balloons floating

6742.08 --> 6747.199
here up there somewhere

6744.4 --> 6747.92
and most of it is just towers it's just

6747.199 --> 6751.04
giant

6747.92 --> 6753.92
radio tower projectors

6751.04 --> 6755.599
that just go a long way and they

6753.92 --> 6757.599
compartmentalize this

6755.599 --> 6759.76
so they have des i think they really

6757.599 --> 6761.360000000001
have just designated certain types of

6759.76 --> 6763.92
frequencies and

6761.36 --> 6765.36
towers as satellites it's like they've

6763.92 --> 6768.2390000000005
got a very specific

6765.36 --> 6770.08
type of radio relay tower for very long

6768.239 --> 6773.199
distances

6770.08 --> 6775.36
and they call that like the satellite

6773.199 --> 6776.32
so every time there's a satellite launch

6775.36 --> 6778.48
that

6776.32 --> 6779.759999999999
something is made or perhaps not even

6778.48 --> 6781.759999999999
it's just said

6779.76 --> 6783.76
and it's like oh this satellite goes up

6781.76 --> 6786.96
and now you have this connection because

6783.76 --> 6790.08
the tower has connected it

6786.96 --> 6794.159
that's how i think it happens

6790.08 --> 6796.48
it's yeah it's a it's a radio uh

6794.159 --> 6798.879999999999
it's a technocratic radio conspiracy you

6796.48 --> 6798.879999999999
could say

6800.159 --> 6807.839999999999
oh yeah communication

6803.199 --> 6809.5199999999995
media and they're lying to you about it

6807.84 --> 6811.599
they're just calling it satellites but

6809.52 --> 6814.8
it's just a lot of people

6811.599 --> 6817.1990000000005
don't know it they just

6814.8 --> 6818.96
get told no we're sending the satellites

6817.199 --> 6820.96
you might even see a rocket launch

6818.96 --> 6822.08
or you get to see a little video where

6820.96 --> 6824.2390000000005
that happens

6822.08 --> 6825.599
because who wants to be present at the

6824.239 --> 6827.598999999999
specific

6825.599 --> 6829.04
rocket launch of their satellite anyway

6827.599 --> 6832.159000000001
who gives a [ __ ] right

6829.04 --> 6834.8
so if you just get to see a video of a

6832.159 --> 6836.4
launch it'll be good enough it'll save a

6834.8 --> 6838.4800000000005
lot of costs for the people that are

6836.4 --> 6841.598999999999
trying to fake that

6838.48 --> 6843.919999999999
so you then get the satellite contract

6841.599 --> 6845.28
and you get your place among the

6843.92 --> 6848.88
satellite broadcast

6845.28 --> 6863.84
tower which is what it is that's how i

6848.88 --> 6863.84
think it works

6866.239 --> 6869.44
cruise ships far from land yeah yet the

6868.639 --> 6873.92
towers

6869.44 --> 6877.36
that reach very very far banana i

6873.92 --> 6878.8
very far as in potentially thousands of

6877.36 --> 6880.239
miles

6878.8 --> 6881.92
there might be towers that could

6880.239 --> 6891.839999999999
literally contact

6881.92 --> 6891.84
or scan things halfway around the world

6894.56 --> 6899.599
there is no orbital mechanics it's a

6896.48 --> 6899.598999999999
fictional construct

6901.28 --> 6908.08
nothing floats up there there is no

6904.96 --> 6910.56
zero g region

6908.08 --> 6911.199
where things will start to fall in

6910.56 --> 6913.04
circles

6911.199 --> 6914.5599999999995
around the presupposed sphere that

6913.04 --> 6917.04
doesn't exist that's a fictional

6914.56 --> 6922.159000000001
construct it's literally science fiction

6917.04 --> 6922.159
that has been reified into reality

6922.96 --> 6929.04
and kept as a guilt secret among yeah

6926.0 --> 6932.32
radio experts

6929.04 --> 6934.56
the radio guild media

6932.32 --> 6947.84
the people that have control over the

6934.56 --> 6947.84
antennas it's their conspiracy

6952.56 --> 6956.080000000001
halfway across the world yeah yeah

6955.36 --> 6961.839999999999
thanks

6956.08 --> 6961.84
for nitpicking

6964.32 --> 6969.648999999999
but you're right it is a cross not

6966.53 --> 6969.648999999999
[Music]

6972.84 --> 6975.84
around

6982.4 --> 6986.0
why those towers being taller would help

6984.88 --> 6989.52
well who knows

6986.0 --> 6992.239
you know i don't know this

6989.52 --> 6992.88
with certainty but it might be that

6992.239 --> 6995.678999999999
these

6992.88 --> 6997.04
yeah the people that are in control of

6995.679 --> 7000.719
this conspiracy with

6997.04 --> 7001.599
radios and satellites they might simply

7000.719 --> 7005.04
be using

7001.599 --> 7005.599
the flat top whatever it may be wherever

7005.04 --> 7009.199
it may be

7005.599 --> 7011.599
they may be effectively know in the know

7009.199 --> 7013.839999999999
how to send this signal and bounce it

7011.599 --> 7017.28
off

7013.84 --> 7020.4800000000005
so in that case a tower does

7017.28 --> 7023.44
not necessarily even need to be as

7020.48 --> 7023.44
incredibly high

7024.4 --> 7027.44
although it would help for a direct

7025.92 --> 7029.4400000000005
connection

7027.44 --> 7031.5199999999995
but i think it might they might have

7029.44 --> 7032.08
figured out how to basically bounce it

7031.52 --> 7035.360000000001
off

7032.08 --> 7037.679
the firmament the flat top the end

7035.36 --> 7038.96
of the container which has to be there

7037.679 --> 7041.599
in some way

7038.96 --> 7042.639
i don't know if this is true but it has

7041.599 --> 7045.1990000000005
been said that

7042.639 --> 7046.159000000001
signals can be bounced off the

7045.199 --> 7048.32
stratosphere

7046.159 --> 7049.36
right so that means there is a bound

7048.32 --> 7051.679
some way

7049.36 --> 7053.679
that's a great indication that there is

7051.679 --> 7055.52
actually a physical thing

7053.679 --> 7056.96
of which these signals are bouncing off

7055.52 --> 7060.2390000000005
because you can't

7056.96 --> 7063.04
bounce signals off air

7060.239 --> 7064.239
no matter what condition it is in is

7063.04 --> 7068.96
ridiculous

7064.239 --> 7068.959999999999
can bounce signals off air doesn't work

7069.44 --> 7073.839999999999
but it has been done it has been

7071.76 --> 7076.719
literally said like oh we're bouncing it

7073.84 --> 7078.32
off this some kind of a sphere

7076.719 --> 7080.96
ionosphere whatever

7078.32 --> 7082.799999999999
so it has been effectively done and this

7080.96 --> 7086.719
was the explanation for it

7082.8 --> 7090.159000000001
well they might have bounced it off

7086.719 --> 7091.04
something but it's not going to be off a

7090.159 --> 7093.679
layer of air

7091.04 --> 7095.62
that's for sure right so i'm going to

7093.679 --> 7098.7390000000005
round out the show

7095.62 --> 7098.739
[Music]

yeah i was a little bit uh in a bad mood

7108.32 --> 7111.679
especially the first part

7112.56 --> 7115.84
but yeah anyway if you liked it anyway
