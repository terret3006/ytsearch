110.24 --> 116.28
the all hell out of the

113.479 --> 120.78999999999999
place I've never seen this many trails

116.28 --> 123.32000000000001
being left it's really messed up

120.79 --> 127.039
[Music]

123.32 --> 131.879
hasn't trailed like this

127.039 --> 134.08
in long time like it's even like leaving

131.879 --> 138.04
shadows and

134.08 --> 138.04000000000002
everything it's just messed

139.92 --> 144.95899999999997
up that's over bright let

148.0 --> 153.0
see n

151.07 --> 156.04
[Music]

153.0 --> 156.04
ah yeah there you

158.44 --> 162.76
go like that's not natural

167.12 --> 172.519
guys those are

169.44 --> 174.68
feathers that's not

172.519 --> 178.20000000000002
natural

174.68 --> 181.0
moist doesn't spread out like that

178.2 --> 183.0
that's ridiculous clouds don't work that

181.0 --> 187.599
way have to

183.0 --> 187.599
be solid particulates

188.0 --> 194.879
involved now I'm not a somebody who

192.12 --> 197.56
typically says that oh

194.879 --> 200.879
it's chemicals

197.56 --> 204.239
or barium salts aluminum dioxide

200.879 --> 206.51899999999998
although that has probably been used in

204.239 --> 206.519
the

206.959 --> 212.239
past but has it been used

213.159 --> 218.959
everywhere I'm not finding any

216.72 --> 223.72
answers there doesn't seem to be a lot

218.959 --> 223.72
of regular testing going on about

224.879 --> 229.67999999999998
this right but whatever they're spraying

227.92 --> 233.07999999999998
they're spraying it now and it's like

229.68 --> 233.08
leaving shadows and

235.439 --> 245.68
everything so right anyway it is is

240.439 --> 245.68
Monday the 25th of September

251.0 --> 257.16
2023 CH temperature is probably

255.0 --> 259.56
like 19 or

257.16 --> 263.72
[Music]

259.56 --> 266.28000000000003
something yep I called it

263.72 --> 268.28000000000003
19° but it's like yeah because the sun

266.28 --> 271.59999999999997
is hitting the room it's nice and warm

268.28 --> 271.59999999999997
in here so

277.6 --> 281.52000000000004
okay now they're predicting it's going

278.96 --> 287.4
to hang around this temperature around

281.52 --> 287.4
the 20 the next week okay sounds

296.08 --> 302.56
great right so uh yeah

301.28 --> 305.479
it's Monday

302.56 --> 307.52
morning expecting people not to show up

305.479 --> 310.24
right away so

307.52 --> 313.52
early but that's all

310.24 --> 316.12
right I'm doing pretty good I got a

313.52 --> 318.28
weird situation here like freaking

316.12 --> 322.319
mosquito bit

318.28 --> 325.55999999999995
me like in on the knuckle and now my

322.319 --> 327.03900000000004
finger is like swollen like a sausage

325.56 --> 330.199
the middle

327.039 --> 332.28
one ah

330.199 --> 334.68
and that happened like two days ago it

332.28 --> 337.88
just got really bad last

334.68 --> 340.12
evening it's

337.88 --> 343.319
freaky but I'm pretty sure it's going to

340.12 --> 343.319
be gone in like two

348.8 --> 352.6
days right other than that there's weird

351.319 --> 355.03900000000004
[ __ ] going

352.6 --> 358.52000000000004
on I'm going to check it right now

355.039 --> 360.08
there's weird stuff going on with this

358.52 --> 363.75899999999996
channel

360.08 --> 368.24
there's very specific people that just

363.759 --> 371.72
keep getting autobanned over and over

368.24 --> 375.12
again I literally had to unban steamy

371.72 --> 375.12
traveler three

376.08 --> 383.479
times in between yesterday's stream and

379.319 --> 383.47900000000004
now and I'm going to check

384.28 --> 389.599
again so I got to give these people

387.4 --> 393.52
wrenches just so they don't get

389.599 --> 396.639
autobanned by somebody I don't know who

393.52 --> 396.639
or how they're doing

409.639 --> 415.479
that like gzilla is continually be

412.88 --> 417.199
getting he got a wrench back but he's

415.479 --> 418.87899999999996
like continually getting banned steamy

417.199 --> 420.24
traveler continually getting banned

418.879 --> 421.8
clutch

420.24 --> 424.759
continually getting banned he's going to

421.8 --> 427.199
get a wrench too I don't know what the

424.759 --> 427.199
[ __ ] is

438.56 --> 446.319
happening yeah so then

442.28 --> 449.75899999999996
not the mystery Banner hasn't struck yet

446.319 --> 452.52000000000004
or again anyway hello Richard G first in

449.759 --> 452.52000000000004
chat good to see

452.639 --> 458.639
you how you doing slowo moon buggy good

455.52 --> 460.79999999999995
to see you wrench party yeah I guess but

458.639 --> 463.40000000000003
it's these specific individuals and this

460.8 --> 465.599
is going back a long time because there

463.4 --> 467.599
has been mystery situations like that

465.599 --> 470.319
for

467.599 --> 472.8
months but it seems to stick to these

470.319 --> 476.759
specific

472.8 --> 476.759
people and I don't know

478.319 --> 481.319
why

491.199 --> 496.12
hey

493.44 --> 500.159
be a

496.12 --> 503.319
big hey B what are you doing

500.159 --> 507.879
here I saw a really huge bumblebee too

503.319 --> 507.879
like two days ago a big one like this

508.24 --> 511.24
big

512.279 --> 518.56
hello maybe you want to go there there's

515.719 --> 518.5600000000001
no flowers in

524.24 --> 529.279
there yes there you go just

538.2 --> 544.6800000000001
lost

541.16 --> 549.36
all right my screen keeps freezing up

544.68 --> 549.3599999999999
too but yeah whatever

550.88 --> 557.279
man it's bugs on my channel for sure and

554.64 --> 559.48
I don't know what like that it's not a

557.279 --> 562.68
person I don't think it's a person

559.48 --> 564.5600000000001
that's doing this steamy traveler got

562.68 --> 567.3199999999999
banned

564.56 --> 570.8
Midstream he literally said to me like

567.32 --> 575.6
in Skype like hey

570.8 --> 578.3199999999999
I was banned suddenly but we didn't see

575.6 --> 580.32
see me traveler get banned you see in

578.32 --> 582.88
the chat everybody that has a wrench you

580.32 --> 587.12
will see when somebody gets timed out or

582.88 --> 590.399
banned we didn't see that so that means

587.12 --> 592.48
there's something really weird going on

590.399 --> 595.88
somebody is like

592.48 --> 598.8000000000001
moderating hacking or something like

595.88 --> 600.0
with the YouTube moderators tools I

598.8 --> 602.0
think

600.0 --> 604.2
something somebody's [ __ ] around with

602.0 --> 604.2
my

605.72 --> 612.9200000000001
channel bees are easier to get out of

608.56 --> 619.279
the house than bats yeah I bet I bet it

612.92 --> 619.279
is four bats in your house in five years

622.399 --> 629.399
okay I think it's a person for sure it

626.079 --> 630.64
it like somebody's got to be doing that

629.399 --> 634.079
Richard

630.64 --> 637.399
G the point is is that they're not doing

634.079 --> 641.279
it because of regular

637.399 --> 643.56
wrench they're not somebody here I I've

641.279 --> 646.04
been I've been watching a lot of wit and

643.56 --> 649.2399999999999
I'm really into the detective mindset so

646.04 --> 651.12
I from the evidence president I know for

649.24 --> 653.44
certain it's not somebody in the chat

651.12 --> 653.44
doing

655.68 --> 662.5999999999999
it like none of you guys

660.48 --> 665.399
because you don't know how to ban

662.6 --> 668.44
somebody without them being banned

665.399 --> 670.72
showing up in chat you see that's not

668.44 --> 674.519
normal that's not a thing you can do

670.72 --> 678.76
with a wrench so somebody's probably

674.519 --> 682.279
screwing with a YouTube moderator

678.76 --> 686.8389999999999
tool and I appreciate

682.279 --> 690.519
the that that be looked into and stopped

686.839 --> 692.9200000000001
perhaps like who's Abus using tools or

690.519 --> 695.9590000000001
who's hacking Maybe YouTube could try to

692.92 --> 699.0
figure that out my account is not hacked

695.959 --> 701.8
but somebody is like still being able to

699.0 --> 701.8
fool around with

702.04 --> 706.7199999999999
it and not even just like also the

705.0 --> 709.839
screen freezing and doesn't make any

706.72 --> 713.1600000000001
damn sense like I've never even seen

709.839 --> 718.1600000000001
that with other YouTube channels like

713.16 --> 720.959
ever using the same browser never ever

718.16 --> 720.959
seen that happen

728.92 --> 734.24
happen if you could do that yeah I mean

736.76 --> 746.16
dude maybe it's some so boy butt hurt by

741.6 --> 750.88
Fe yeah could be I mean it's probably

746.16 --> 750.88
somebody like trying to ruin my channel

755.399 --> 763.279
sure but I mean does YouTube keep track

759.8 --> 763.279
of its moderator

764.6 --> 769.0
activities I mean I don't think they

766.839 --> 770.0790000000001
really appreciate that moderators are

769.0 --> 773.88
going to go

770.079 --> 776.399
out and just you abuse their tools to

773.88 --> 776.399
bully

777.839 --> 780.839
people

792.56 --> 794.8
all

796.839 --> 799.839
right

802.04 --> 807.5999999999999
so I'm going to keep checking that band

805.279 --> 810.4399999999999
list because I think that people will

807.6 --> 814.24
just be getting and all the

810.44 --> 814.24
time without it ever

819.92 --> 823.959
showing until I can get them

835.04 --> 841.4399999999999
wrenches and in that sense dude

837.72 --> 841.44
technically a lot lot of people

844.0 --> 849.92
here could just

846.48 --> 851.8000000000001
be like people I don't really recognize

849.92 --> 854.3199999999999
that we're just showing up one day and

851.8 --> 855.519
like oh hello we had a nice conversation

854.32 --> 859.32
and then they got

855.519 --> 862.24
banned by the same city it could be like

859.32 --> 864.36
a lot of the accounts in here I

862.24 --> 866.6
definitely recognize as being troll

864.36 --> 867.6800000000001
accounts but there are some that I'm not

866.6 --> 870.6800000000001
really

867.68 --> 870.68
sure

873.959 --> 880.5999999999999
then again occasionally some gamma does

877.04 --> 882.199
show up with the sort of bland looking

880.6 --> 885.399
account name and all

882.199 --> 888.04
that and then I kick them out

885.399 --> 890.759
so yeah okay nobody's in there that

888.04 --> 890.759
shouldn't be in

895.079 --> 900.68
there all right

897.68 --> 900.68
then

907.0 --> 910.24
okay all

915.83 --> 920.6800000000001
[Applause]

917.56 --> 923.8

920.68 --> 926.8
one C the socks

923.8 --> 926.8

1142.88 --> 1149.2
out of it and just

1146.6 --> 1151.4399999999998
make anything you can imagine with a

1149.2 --> 1154.44
construction kit it's like going to be

1151.44 --> 1154.44
like

1154.52 --> 1160.679
Minecraft like elaborateness it's not 3D

1158.0 --> 1163.32
though but like there's you can

1160.679 --> 1167.0

1163.32 --> 1169.4399999999998
kit like I'm going to have contests with

1167.0 --> 1170.72
this game once it's done

1169.44 --> 1172.96
it's going to be I'm going to make a

1170.72 --> 1175.2
couple of levels which is very easy you

1172.96 --> 1178.64
just do a few different styles like

1175.2 --> 1181.679
oldfashioned boulder dash then the

1178.64 --> 1185.0
hybridized which is like boulder dash

1181.679 --> 1187.48
AFL which is like some hacking group or

1185.0 --> 1191.28
whatever that made like a boulder dash

1187.48 --> 1194.48
game that used like growing walls and

1191.28 --> 1197.76
was weird it wasn't like the the

1194.48 --> 1199.919
typical cave setup it was much more like

1197.76 --> 1202.72
w this all this just a maze so it's

1199.919 --> 1206.48
going to be like old wer Dash levels

1202.72 --> 1209.159
maze levels and then all hell like

1206.48 --> 1212.24
literally the the

1209.159 --> 1215.7600000000002
mega mega puzzle with like super

1212.24 --> 1217.52
electronics and lasers and [ __ ] and dude

1215.76 --> 1219.8799999999999
that's going to blow people's mind so

1217.52 --> 1220.9189999999999
much after that point it's going to be

1219.88 --> 1224.88
like

1220.919 --> 1226.72
okay make levels different tiers of

1224.88 --> 1231.72
levels like

1226.72 --> 1236.28
from very basic setups to well slightly

1231.72 --> 1237.799
more mazik to very very serious

1236.28 --> 1240.96
complicated

1237.799 --> 1243.24
mechanical like an electronic

1240.96 --> 1246.039
box where there's like buttons

1243.24 --> 1249.4
everywhere and and that activate things

1246.039 --> 1253.36
and mirrors that you can rotate and like

1249.4 --> 1255.52
a real serious puzzle system so that's

1253.36 --> 1258.36
all possible with this game and people

1255.52 --> 1261.28
can build that like there will be a

1258.36 --> 1261.28
construction kit

1261.679 --> 1266.4
available like the construction Kit's

1263.919 --> 1270.24
actually going to be really easy to

1266.4 --> 1272.64
make after it's finally been done it's

1270.24 --> 1275.52
because I'm probably going to make the

1272.64 --> 1278.0
construction kit specifically so I can

1275.52 --> 1282.36
build levels with

1278.0 --> 1282.36
it anyway I'm really into

1284.76 --> 1290.039
it and uh yeah let's see where this goes

1295.06 --> 1298.1699999999998
[Music]

1303.72 --> 1307.0
right but I'm going to need a

1304.679 --> 1308.5590000000002
construction kit just to test things out

1307.0 --> 1310.279
because it would be amazing in the

1308.559 --> 1312.6399999999999
construction kit if there was like a

1310.279 --> 1316.039
Dynam like a construction kit that you

1312.64 --> 1318.8400000000001
can literally modularize that you can

1316.039 --> 1322.919
add blocks

1318.84 --> 1325.12
that it's very capable of adding things

1322.919 --> 1327.679
not of changing whatever is in there but

1325.12 --> 1327.6789999999999
to add

1328.799 --> 1334.24
things but I have to be careful with it

1331.6 --> 1336.08
though like eventually I will like put a

1334.24 --> 1337.559
lock on it because people will try to

1336.08 --> 1340.84
[ __ ] with it and then just screw the

1337.559 --> 1343.96
game up in their

1340.84 --> 1345.84
version like the actual function of it

1343.96 --> 1348.159
because I mean if you [ __ ] around with

1345.84 --> 1352.559
it like the whole system could really

1348.159 --> 1352.5590000000002
get weird and totally

1366.36 --> 1369.36
chaotic

1369.84 --> 1375.039
Skyrim yeah Skyrim I I did like kind of

1373.039 --> 1378.48
but it because of the because there's so

1375.039 --> 1380.96
many beautiful places there

1378.48 --> 1385.32
because of the sights cuz it is sort of

1380.96 --> 1387.8400000000001
a 3D game but I have still played that

1385.32 --> 1390.8799999999999
one

1387.84 --> 1392.52
because yeah it's not super it's like

1390.88 --> 1395.5590000000002
this beautiful landscape and you can

1392.52 --> 1395.559
just sit still and

1399.0 --> 1405.32
look so I wouldn't get nauseated as

1402.32 --> 1406.8799999999999
quickly cuz if it's always moving I get

1405.32 --> 1409.8799999999999
freaking

1406.88 --> 1409.88
nauseated

1411.2 --> 1415.76
but then also in the game if you get

1413.559 --> 1418.039
scared and you have to get on the run

1415.76 --> 1422.0
then yeah you definitely get na I get

1418.039 --> 1422.0
nauseated it's very it sucks a

1423.32 --> 1430.4399999999998
lot H but yeah Skyrim didn't really do

1427.24 --> 1433.0
that it's just it enabled you to just

1430.44 --> 1435.96
enjoy the

1433.0 --> 1438.24
sights to like walk around things to

1435.96 --> 1440.2
like really like enjoy how the Mountain

1438.24 --> 1442.52
looks or something and that was great I

1440.2 --> 1442.52
like

1449.039 --> 1454.679
that especially all these caves are

1451.919 --> 1454.679
amazing

1454.72 --> 1459.559
caves just

1456.559 --> 1459.559
brilliant

1466.799 --> 1469.799
stuff

1483.76 --> 1488.96
uh

1485.52 --> 1492.279
what exactly what I was talking

1488.96 --> 1494.039
about okay M AAL low fruit was yeah no

1492.279 --> 1496.76
he said he might be helping me and that

1494.039 --> 1499.76
is great and I will probably accept the

1496.76 --> 1499.76
help

1500.919 --> 1505.76
if he's capable of actually meeting me

1503.2 --> 1508.6000000000001
because I don't want to do everything I

1505.76 --> 1512.36
want to meet people that I'm going to

1508.6 --> 1516.0
basically be teaming up with on

1512.36 --> 1516.0
something that's going to last for a

1517.679 --> 1524.48
while okay yeah Jason yeah it's

1522.0 --> 1526.52
okay well that's not a good way of

1524.48 --> 1529.679
testing if you're still banned because

1526.52 --> 1531.24
that will get you banned

1529.679 --> 1534.24
next time say

1531.24 --> 1534.24
hello

1547.76 --> 1553.32
okay hey clutch by the way I'm giving

1550.72 --> 1553.32
you a wrench

1554.24 --> 1560.0
quickly

1556.36 --> 1565.52
yeah you keep getting banned too by this

1560.0 --> 1565.52
uh mystery Banning situation it's really

1567.399 --> 1573.2399999999998
weird you and stey

1569.88 --> 1576.1200000000001
traveler and gzilla

1573.24 --> 1579.6
like when gzilla didn't have a rench he

1576.12 --> 1582.52
just continually just got Auto banned I

1579.6 --> 1584.52
banned him that one time actively and

1582.52 --> 1586.6
after that he just kept getting banned

1584.52 --> 1589.6
it's so

1586.6 --> 1589.6
weird

1597.799 --> 1601.76
Sports anyway hello Dr

1616.2 --> 1623.3990000000001
utar man I I got so like dude I got this

1620.52 --> 1626.799
compartmentalization of the

1623.399 --> 1631.0
graphics with the

1626.799 --> 1634.48
actual yeah game frame like the the the

1631.0 --> 1637.2
engine itself I've got this so clearly

1634.48 --> 1640.279
in my mind it's crazy and the weird

1637.2 --> 1643.559
thing was is that back in the day like

1640.279 --> 1645.919
that wasn't really possible so I I never

1643.559 --> 1648.399
I was just like oh yeah do that but like

1645.919 --> 1649.76
I would never be able to get it to work

1648.399 --> 1652.559
so it's just

1649.76 --> 1655.32
like we'll just go with pretty basic

1652.559 --> 1658.6789999999999
Graphics just like Comer 64 bul Dash and

1655.32 --> 1661.6399999999999
that will work well

1658.679 --> 1663.919
now I'm I've been thinking I'm going to

1661.64 --> 1665.519
do it in a two-tier step I'm going to

1663.919 --> 1669.159
basically give

1665.519 --> 1671.279
it commodor 64 style Graphics but yeah

1669.159 --> 1672.3600000000001
bigger but the point is that it's

1671.279 --> 1675.08
passive

1672.36 --> 1678.399
characters like

1675.08 --> 1680.96
actual yeah passive character

1678.399 --> 1683.8799999999999
that it's a roulette of characters

1680.96 --> 1686.8400000000001
because those are the things already

1683.88 --> 1690.5590000000002
they are a roulette of units so it's

1686.84 --> 1693.399
like explosion explosion is like uh what

1690.559 --> 1697.2
is it three

1693.399 --> 1700.6399999999999
units boom what says what it says now

1697.2 --> 1703.48
change to explosion to

1700.64 --> 1707.76
Boom now change to explosion

1703.48 --> 1710.88
3 and then it's gone right that's like

1707.76 --> 1713.799
literally what would happen and even

1710.88 --> 1718.72
though they all counted as the same that

1713.799 --> 1718.72
would provide the animation and like a

1719.84 --> 1726.279
duration like I'm going to do that but

1722.799 --> 1729.08
then there's going to be like hooks like

1726.279 --> 1734.32
extra Graphics instructions so that

1729.08 --> 1737.6789999999999
basically you have the basic graphic but

1734.32 --> 1738.8799999999999
then there can be like a graphics and

1737.679 --> 1743.919
that will

1738.88 --> 1746.6000000000001
literally replace what you see with

1743.919 --> 1748.3990000000001
animation so that basically animations

1746.6 --> 1750.799
can simultaneous happen so an explosion

1748.399 --> 1753.5189999999998
instead could be and then you see rage

1750.799 --> 1755.76
falling or something right in the

1753.519 --> 1757.84
passive system that could never happen

1755.76 --> 1760.799
but you can get all

1757.84 --> 1763.1589999999999
theatrical dude with that graphic system

1760.799 --> 1766.0
you can make it all Michael Bay and [ __ ]

1763.159 --> 1768.0390000000002
like explosions everywhere like and look

1766.0 --> 1768.96
really Fireball exp you make it look

1768.039 --> 1771.399
really

1768.96 --> 1772.559
cool that would never be possible with

1771.399 --> 1775.1589999999999
just basic

1772.559 --> 1777.32
characters but if you keep it completely

1775.159 --> 1779.679
separate then you can have like an

1777.32 --> 1781.6789999999999
editor game version where there's no

1779.679 --> 1784.88
added on animation which will

1781.679 --> 1788.0
significantly speed up however you're

1784.88 --> 1791.64
playing it or running it but it will

1788.0 --> 1792.519
still be very comprehensible as to what

1791.64 --> 1796.3200000000002
is

1792.519 --> 1798.76
what without the added on special

1796.32 --> 1800.4399999999998
graphics so that you really have that

1798.76 --> 1803.64
basic boulder dash

1800.44 --> 1806.2
feel that's much more elaborate but

1803.64 --> 1808.7990000000002
still very understandable as to what

1806.2 --> 1808.799
you're looking

1809.679 --> 1815.88
at so it's not going to be all 3D is in

1812.76 --> 1818.0
that sense like the later Graphics yeah

1815.88 --> 1822.88
you could literally make it into a like

1818.0 --> 1827.36
a live 3D scape where it's all

1822.88 --> 1829.5590000000002
basically uh polygon 3D based block

1827.36 --> 1831.6399999999999
graphics and the explosions and all that

1829.559 --> 1834.519
like it could be made extremely

1831.64 --> 1837.919
beautiful with the graphics

1834.519 --> 1843.36
later and I'm like I'm just getting

1837.919 --> 1845.48
ready to get to that stage of

1843.36 --> 1846.9599999999998
like how are you going to represent

1845.48 --> 1849.2
these Graphics well at least I have the

1846.96 --> 1852.159
luxury of not having like an extreme

1849.2 --> 1856.24
pixel limit like bullet Dash did like

1852.159 --> 1859.24
this little block was it like 8 by

1856.24 --> 1862.799
16 pixels or

1859.24 --> 1866.84
something like sort of broad pixels and

1862.799 --> 1870.0
yeah that's like really primitive well I

1866.84 --> 1872.9189999999999
can just very easily say okay let's make

1870.0 --> 1874.679
that like at least three times bigger

1872.919 --> 1877.3600000000001
and you have so much more detail you got

1874.679 --> 1878.519
so much more color options that you can

1877.36 --> 1882.7199999999998
really

1878.519 --> 1885.159
easily already think of like scanning an

1882.72 --> 1888.24
actual photograph of something or

1885.159 --> 1892.24
rendering a 3D image and then literally

1888.24 --> 1895.2
pasting that into that icon work on it

1892.24 --> 1899.919
like the transparent parts and all

1895.2 --> 1902.919
that or background part and then have a

1899.919 --> 1905.279
very decent very basic graphic for it so

1902.919 --> 1909.48
you can actually see like hey that's a

1905.279 --> 1910.36
glass Boulder or that's a glass block or

1909.48 --> 1914.48
hey

1910.36 --> 1914.4799999999998
that's like plastic or

1914.799 --> 1920.639
rubber or it's like

1918.48 --> 1923.1200000000001
transparent plastic which should look

1920.639 --> 1924.8799999999999
different from glass glass would

1923.12 --> 1929.1589999999999
probably I would give it like a bit of

1924.88 --> 1932.0
an yeah uh what do you call

1929.159 --> 1934.72
that I it just looks different

1932.0 --> 1937.039
refraction index is also different I'm

1934.72 --> 1939.0
going to figure out how to make that

1937.039 --> 1940.96
distinct the different and I might just

1939.0 --> 1943.519
use colors right I mean the original

1940.96 --> 1945.96
buet Dash there was this three color

1943.519 --> 1949.3990000000001
system and then you could rule at the

1945.96 --> 1952.08
colors like oh I'm to use blue black and

1949.399 --> 1954.0
white typical like and then everything

1952.08 --> 1955.519
looked like that those combination of

1954.0 --> 1957.919
colors well I don't have that issue

1955.519 --> 1959.799
anymore so I can make distinct looking

1957.919 --> 1962.24
colored pictures so I'll have for

1959.799 --> 1965.559
example the crystal wall which used to

1962.24 --> 1967.76
be like a magic wall look like regular

1965.559 --> 1972.0
brick wall a stone or a diamond we fall

1967.76 --> 1974.679
it and then and then it started like

1972.0 --> 1977.279
flashing and that is how you then

1974.679 --> 1979.96
recognize like hey that's that's Magic

1977.279 --> 1982.24
wall and if you dump a stone on it then

1979.96 --> 1985.279
a diamond falls out of it if there's

1982.24 --> 1986.76
space beneath and if you drop a diamond

1985.279 --> 1988.519
on it then the stone falls out if

1986.76 --> 1991.8799999999999
there's space beneath right that was

1988.519 --> 1994.88
like a basic thing

1991.88 --> 1996.6000000000001
like not really exploited super much

1994.88 --> 1997.7600000000002
even in the original buer Dash but it

1996.6 --> 2000.76
did

1997.76 --> 2003.2
exist and I'm turning that into crystal

2000.76 --> 2005.559
wall like a separate substance that has

2003.2 --> 2007.559
slightly different properties but could

2005.559 --> 2009.799
have like a distinct color and a

2007.559 --> 2011.8799999999999
completely different look like it's

2009.799 --> 2015.12
actually a wall with like Crystal

2011.88 --> 2016.5590000000002
sticking it's like a big Crystal chunk

2015.12 --> 2018.639
right where crystals are sticking all

2016.559 --> 2020.799
over the place and then it's going to

2018.639 --> 2023.76
have like a distinct

2020.799 --> 2025.639
color and the distinct color I could

2023.76 --> 2027.84
even because I had thought of like

2025.639 --> 2029.799
making a multiple tier Diamond system

2027.84 --> 2032.9189999999999
where there's different types of gems

2029.799 --> 2035.2
basically not just

2032.919 --> 2037.76
diamonds and that those gems had

2035.2 --> 2039.799
different colors and that the crystal

2037.76 --> 2041.679
wall could also then have different

2039.799 --> 2044.2
colors based on the type of gem that's

2041.679 --> 2046.039
going to fall out of there because

2044.2 --> 2046.919
whatever you're dropping onto it doesn't

2046.039 --> 2049.52
really

2046.919 --> 2053.2000000000003
matter except for whether it's just a

2049.52 --> 2053.2
rock or or a

2054.119 --> 2060.839
gem cuz there's always going to fall

2057.159 --> 2062.679
Stone Boulders out of it and never any

2060.839 --> 2063.7999999999997
other like no matter what type of bould

2062.679 --> 2065.2000000000003
you drop on there it's going to

2063.8 --> 2067.32
disappear in there and then the stone

2065.2 --> 2069.359
one's going to come out if you drop a

2067.32 --> 2072.28
gem on it and a Gem's going to drop out

2069.359 --> 2074.7999999999997
if you drop any type of stone on it or

2072.28 --> 2076.96
any type of bowler on it but it's going

2074.8 --> 2080.7200000000003
to have a distinct look and that's like

2076.96 --> 2080.7200000000003
really useful that you can do that

2080.839 --> 2089.0
now so that would be like what colors

2084.879 --> 2089.0
would you take for

2090.0 --> 2093.28
gems

2091.839 --> 2095.48
purple

2093.28 --> 2099.8390000000004
[Music]

2095.48 --> 2099.839
green and red

2102.16 --> 2107.3999999999996
perhaps it would be cool if it would

2104.16 --> 2110.1189999999997
represent actual gems yeah Green for

2107.4 --> 2114.96
like Emerald red for Ruby

2110.119 --> 2118.079
and uh what is the other one purple for

2114.96 --> 2121.32
amethyst cuz those colors don't

2118.079 --> 2123.44
typically they're not like going to be

2121.32 --> 2128.8
intrical to like

2123.44 --> 2128.8
other colors of other events happening

2137.68 --> 2142.68
so that you could really recognize what

2139.96 --> 2146.119
is there by the

2142.68 --> 2147.72
color it would make it a bit yeah I mean

2146.119 --> 2149.92
color blind people are going to have

2147.72 --> 2152.0
then because the funny thing was old B

2149.92 --> 2153.8
Dash you could play it if you were color

2152.0 --> 2157.359
blind

2153.8 --> 2158.92
cuz yeah the colors did not really you

2157.359 --> 2160.72
wouldn't recognize something

2158.92 --> 2163.319
specifically by the color you would

2160.72 --> 2166.319
recognize it by the pattern of it you

2163.319 --> 2169.319
see this game will not be able to

2166.319 --> 2171.7599999999998
accommodate for that

2169.319 --> 2175.7599999999998
anyway yes Jason

2171.76 --> 2178.48
hello W yeah welcome back and uh have a

2175.76 --> 2181.8390000000004
good working day I guess your internet

2178.48 --> 2181.839
is crappy okay

2182.24 --> 2189.16
dank but

2184.48 --> 2191.839
uh I'm just so full with like the entire

2189.16 --> 2193.7599999999998
plan of the game and I'm going to like

2191.839 --> 2197.2
I'm going to like push myself to like

2193.76 --> 2200.0
keep working on it and like like keep

2197.2 --> 2200.0
rolling on

2208.48 --> 2212.56
also I wonder

2213.48 --> 2219.119
like I wonder if like Adam me would be

2216.68 --> 2222.52
interested or has the time yeah that

2219.119 --> 2224.2000000000003
probably not that one because it would

2222.52 --> 2227.8
be pretty cool if somebody could like

2224.2 --> 2230.72
help me at least like with

2227.8 --> 2232.48
graphics for the basic Graphics even

2230.72 --> 2235.839
which should be relatively simple it's

2232.48 --> 2235.839
just like a bunch

2236.64 --> 2243.0789999999997
of graphic blocks like that's what I

2239.839 --> 2245.599
need a whole bunch of graphic blocks and

2243.079 --> 2247.2400000000002
that's it all passive nothing

2245.599 --> 2248.92
moving

2247.24 --> 2251.7599999999998
it it

2248.92 --> 2256.0
like it would be great if it looked

2251.76 --> 2256.0
really like the same quality all of

2258.96 --> 2267.48
it hey steamy traveler yeah you better

2263.4 --> 2267.48
oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] did I just

2267.56 --> 2277.839
do okay this one is on me sorry about

2272.52 --> 2279.599
that what the hell okay let's try again

2277.839 --> 2283.56
add

2279.599 --> 2287.1600000000003
moderator sorry that was a I

2283.56 --> 2287.16
misclicked sorry about

2300.52 --> 2306.119
that they not the Apple that Adam and

2303.76 --> 2308.5200000000004
Eve in trouble it was another similar

2306.119 --> 2308.52
looking

2311.599 --> 2317.3590000000004
okay was it the apple of life then

2315.28 --> 2319.2000000000003
weren't there multiple apples apples of

2317.359 --> 2321.56
knowledge of Good and Evil and the apple

2319.2 --> 2323.7599999999998
of life and they could eat from the

2321.56 --> 2327.2
apple of

2323.76 --> 2327.2000000000003
life and they

2330.48 --> 2338.52
did maybe that's why they lived so damn

2333.319 --> 2338.52
long because they had that Apple of life

2338.839 --> 2341.319
makes you

2343.28 --> 2348.3190000000004
think stey Traver hidden for saying good

2348.68 --> 2354.24
yeah I'm sure he'll I I mean he's not

2352.24 --> 2356.7599999999998
even he could immediately speak up right

2354.24 --> 2356.7599999999998
now by the

2357.359 --> 2365.2799999999997
way can you say hello again steamy

2360.68 --> 2365.2799999999997
traveler hello LSG good to see

2365.44 --> 2368.44
you

2384.88 --> 2390.079
Mondays

2386.48 --> 2392.079
up yeah early Mondays I really

2390.079 --> 2393.8390000000004
appreciate that you guys still still

2392.079 --> 2396.599
still do show up

2393.839 --> 2398.72
though and for the record I'm in a

2396.599 --> 2401.119
pretty good mood even though I've been

2398.72 --> 2404.16
stung and my middle finger just turned

2401.119 --> 2407.599
into a sausage look at

2404.16 --> 2407.5989999999997
this but

2411.28 --> 2417.76
uh despite that I'm just like inspired

2414.68 --> 2420.16
so I that when I'm inspired I usually am

2417.76 --> 2424.92
in a good mood I might be

2420.16 --> 2428.52
like a little Snappy sometimes when I'm

2424.92 --> 2431.4
inspired but I'm never

2428.52 --> 2433.72
demoralized what bit you probably a

2431.4 --> 2436.0
really big

2433.72 --> 2438.48
mosquito there were a couple in this

2436.0 --> 2442.079
room like two days ago in the evening

2438.48 --> 2444.04
and I thought that I had basically cut

2442.079 --> 2446.079
them all because in that night there was

2444.04 --> 2447.48
like three or four mosquitoes that were

2446.079 --> 2451.8390000000004
coming after

2447.48 --> 2454.04
me and I hunt them while I'm sleeping in

2451.839 --> 2456.319
the dark because I can literally just

2454.04 --> 2458.359
hear so exactly where they are that I

2456.319 --> 2460.839
can suppress my

2458.359 --> 2462.7599999999998
nervousness because it's yeah it's a

2460.839 --> 2466.319
freaking mosquito

2462.76 --> 2469.2400000000002
coming it's very close but I can

2466.319 --> 2472.2
basically let it like the mosquito sound

2469.24 --> 2474.9599999999996
wakes me up like a fear spurt but then I

2472.2 --> 2478.2799999999997
basically don't actually get the the

2474.96 --> 2482.0
fear effect it just startles me in

2478.28 --> 2484.2400000000002
alertness and then I can like use my

2482.0 --> 2486.04
hearing to just exactly pinpoint when

2484.24 --> 2488.7599999999998
they're close enough for me to be able

2486.04 --> 2488.7599999999998
to squash

2492.56 --> 2496.119
them between my

2497.56 --> 2503.72
blanket and yeah I thought I had them

2501.16 --> 2506.1189999999997
all but apparently somewhere it could

2503.72 --> 2508.52
have also been look when I am at night

2506.119 --> 2512.2400000000002
and I'm behind the computer I don't pay

2508.52 --> 2514.319
a lot of I don't have as much alertness

2512.24 --> 2516.56
anymore and sometimes freaking

2514.319 --> 2518.839
mosquitoes just go flying on my hands

2516.56 --> 2521.839
and I don't even notice and it's that's

2518.839 --> 2525.04
how this [ __ ] [ __ ] happens it's then

2521.839 --> 2527.2799999999997
it happens in the night I'm like low

2525.04 --> 2530.119
alertness and they just freaking fly on

2527.28 --> 2532.3590000000004
my hands and then I don't even feel that

2530.119 --> 2535.2000000000003
which is weird to me usually I feel that

2532.359 --> 2537.92
sort of [ __ ] but I

2535.2 --> 2539.5989999999997
guess that particular

2537.92 --> 2543.76
hour I

2539.599 --> 2543.76
don't so that's what I think that

2545.16 --> 2548.16
happened

2551.44 --> 2554.7200000000003
an elephant stepped on

2558.76 --> 2561.76
it

2565.28 --> 2572.2000000000003
no have you heard fight of letter Earth

2569.8 --> 2577.52
converted RI

2572.2 --> 2582.1189999999997
in oh my God watched theit yet no bord

2577.52 --> 2584.7599999999998
boy but I mean whatever Rachel was on

2582.119 --> 2584.76
the fence

2589.76 --> 2597.48
anyway she was never like a outspoken

2593.04 --> 2597.48
flat earther anyway so I don't really

2600.0 --> 2603.92
[Music]

2601.319 --> 2606.16
care she's just going to stumble around

2603.92 --> 2608.64
with that then get corrected she's

2606.16 --> 2611.2
somebody that just like oh convince me

2608.64 --> 2614.48
and she's basically just like please

2611.2 --> 2617.359
just use me like a pinball flat earthers

2614.48 --> 2619.599
and anti flat earthers convince me get

2617.359 --> 2621.7999999999997
me to your side oh yeah oh let take me

2619.599 --> 2623.7200000000003
here oh yes take me that's what I think

2621.8 --> 2625.92
is actually happening with her she just

2623.72 --> 2628.839
really likes the attention and she wants

2625.92 --> 2628.839
people to convince

2629.04 --> 2633.079
her that's what I really think is

2631.119 --> 2635.88
happening because she's never really

2633.079 --> 2638.96
actually like really making a stand no

2635.88 --> 2641.079
she she's just like oh I heard this I

2638.96 --> 2644.28
think this now and then people like no

2641.079 --> 2646.76
no no no don't like this and right she

2644.28 --> 2649.4
likes that she likes people to like give

2646.76 --> 2653.0
her attention by trying to correct her I

2649.4 --> 2655.28
think trying to convince her because

2653.0 --> 2658.68
people also sometimes if they're good at

2655.28 --> 2660.8390000000004
it try to be nice to you because they

2658.68 --> 2663.48
want you on your side especially

2660.839 --> 2665.0
anti-flat earthers do that so I think

2663.48 --> 2667.48
she's just kind of

2665.0 --> 2670.0
like

2667.48 --> 2670.0
playing

2672.839 --> 2682.04
everybody and I'm not playing along with

2676.8 --> 2682.04
it hey blue pill Devolution good to see

2690.68 --> 2697.5989999999997
you right so I mean I I predict that

2695.72 --> 2700.2799999999997
she's going to be

2697.599 --> 2703.2400000000002
like after a while she's probably going

2700.28 --> 2705.88
to be back to Flat Earth again I'm

2703.24 --> 2708.0
serious but she's she's just she's

2705.88 --> 2712.119
always going to be on the fence you see

2708.0 --> 2714.48
it's just like it yeah where on the

2712.119 --> 2716.839
fence is raie going to hang on one side

2714.48 --> 2718.48
of the fence or the other like where's

2716.839 --> 2720.2
she going to clap hands with people on

2718.48 --> 2723.079
the ground on one side of the fence or

2720.2 --> 2725.4399999999996
the other that's what she's doing she's

2723.079 --> 2727.96
going to flip back again cuz she's never

2725.44 --> 2731.079
really coming down from the fence you

2727.96 --> 2733.559
see she never has once I've never seen

2731.079 --> 2733.559
her do

2735.72 --> 2741.7999999999997
that she would let people like tug her

2739.28 --> 2747.0
but she'd always have those

2741.8 --> 2749.44
feet clench clenched on the fence she'd

2747.0 --> 2753.24
never actually let go and that's what's

2749.44 --> 2753.2400000000002
happening in my

2753.64 --> 2757.8799999999997
estimation uh

2759.8 --> 2763.8
good drive for two or three hours

2764.68 --> 2771.3999999999996
me I mean in the small countries clutch

2768.72 --> 2773.48
yeah depending on where you are I mean

2771.4 --> 2776.76
the Netherlands it's going to be

2773.48 --> 2780.16
like 3

2776.76 --> 2784.76
hours before you get to the Border

2780.16 --> 2784.7599999999998
pretty much from the middle of

2784.8 --> 2791.6800000000003
it oh wait maybe quicker two three if

2789.319 --> 2794.48
you're going to go to

2791.68 --> 2798.04
Germany and if you want to go to Belgium

2794.48 --> 2801.2
it's take a bit longer no no it's pretty

2798.04 --> 2803.2
quick but any mean yeah so the

2801.2 --> 2806.3999999999996
Netherlands is usually like one or two

2803.2 --> 2810.64
hours to cross but like Germany like

2806.4 --> 2814.359
takes at least four four hours I think

2810.64 --> 2819.2799999999997
France takes like five or

2814.359 --> 2819.2799999999997
six when you do it from the north

2827.64 --> 2832.64
south so it all depends on how the

2830.68 --> 2834.2799999999997
quality of the roads are and well in

2832.64 --> 2836.96
France they are pretty

2834.28 --> 2839.52
decent they have like good toll roads

2836.96 --> 2841.599
and all that that make it relatively

2839.52 --> 2845.4
fast to go through Germany has just

2841.599 --> 2846.319
really big road systems and you can get

2845.4 --> 2850.0
you can

2846.319 --> 2854.359
drive very fast there so that also helps

2850.0 --> 2854.359
you speed it up going through the

2874.72 --> 2879.3999999999996
country could drive for 8 hours and

2876.96 --> 2882.319
still be in your Province yeah America

2879.4 --> 2882.319
is just huge

2883.599 --> 2888.1600000000003
clutch 10 hours started

2903.72 --> 2908.9599999999996
wow needs to walk 5 minutes so she can

2907.16 --> 2911.359
go from Wheels thing that's hilarious

2908.96 --> 2911.359
flow

2923.24 --> 2931.62
[Music]

2934.599 --> 2937.599
fruit

2960.14 --> 2963.37
[Music]

2964.52 --> 2967.52
for

2971.68 --> 2976.9199999999996
it's hilarious I mean my fingers

2973.72 --> 2977.9199999999996
literally don't even look alike now look

2976.92 --> 2982.079
at

2977.92 --> 2982.079
this that doesn't really look

2994.52 --> 2997.52
alike

3024.44 --> 3027.44
h

3043.92 --> 3049.359
can I see where the place yeah I think

3046.24 --> 3049.359
it's like right on my

3051.559 --> 3056.9100000000003
knuckle which is like the worst place

3054.119 --> 3060.08
ever to get get stung on on your

3056.91 --> 3060.08
[Music]

3075.24 --> 3080.5989999999997
hands anyway it's just distracting

3084.359 --> 3088.96
me

3087.16 --> 3092.5589999999997
I just hope my

3088.96 --> 3097.319
uh my blood circulation can just clean

3092.559 --> 3097.3190000000004
it up already I really hope

3102.599 --> 3108.079
so right so yeah uh what do you guys

3106.0 --> 3110.599
want to talk about I just addressed

3108.079 --> 3112.76
about RI like how she's on the fence and

3110.599 --> 3114.3590000000004
all

3112.76 --> 3117.3590000000004
that

3114.359 --> 3117.359
uh

3117.599 --> 3121.6800000000003
weing between your finger is the worst

3123.28 --> 3128.3190000000004
place yeah

3126.64 --> 3132.1189999999997
yeah

3128.319 --> 3135.079
well it is one of the most annoying

3132.119 --> 3140.119
places but usually when I get stung

3135.079 --> 3143.119
there like at least it

3140.119 --> 3146.0
like when it's on the knuckle it takes

3143.119 --> 3148.92
forever to get rid of it

3146.0 --> 3151.28
like because it's just in a super

3148.92 --> 3153.88
inconvenient

3151.28 --> 3157.2000000000003
spot when it's in between your fingers

3153.88 --> 3159.28
or it's like right on your arm yeah it

3157.2 --> 3162.0
will be a like your blood there's just

3159.28 --> 3164.44
more blood availability and it will like

3162.0 --> 3166.559
clear it out quicker that's why on the

3164.44 --> 3169.04
knuckle it's [ __ ] annoying because

3166.559 --> 3171.8390000000004
when you get stung there it takes like

3169.04 --> 3173.599
twice as long before it's gone that's

3171.839 --> 3176.2799999999997
why it

3173.599 --> 3178.28
sucks but yeah the itching in between

3176.28 --> 3181.44
your fingers that is [ __ ] annoying I

3178.28 --> 3181.44

some people don't understand aam's razor

3339.4 --> 3348.64
no blue pill Devolution it's not that

3344.92 --> 3352.52
it's she doesn't

3348.64 --> 3357.0
care she doesn't actually really care

3352.52 --> 3357.0
about this it's just a game for her

3357.359 --> 3362.16
she just likes the

3359.44 --> 3364.64
attention she likes people to try to

3362.16 --> 3364.64
convert

3369.079 --> 3373.96
her she's on the fence she's not coming

3382.4 --> 3386.92
off like sometimes it seems like she

3385.2 --> 3389.72
just doesn't get it or that she's dumb

3386.92 --> 3394.2400000000002
or something I think that she's just

3389.72 --> 3394.24
doing that on purpose I think she's

3405.46 --> 3410.039
[Music]

3407.359 --> 3413.0389999999998
playing that's lame

3410.039 --> 3413.88
yeah I don't trust her I haven't really

3413.039 --> 3417.96
for a

3413.88 --> 3421.0
while she's like she

3417.96 --> 3424.119
doesn't feel any

3421.0 --> 3427.68
like seriousness about it like she could

3424.119 --> 3430.96
just side with Dell which is like really

3427.68 --> 3432.7599999999998
stupid it really is she doesn't really

3430.96 --> 3434.4
care about the technical arguments it's

3432.76 --> 3435.6800000000003
like she doesn't remember it she's just

3434.4 --> 3440.039
going with the

3435.68 --> 3443.64
flow and she likes to be have a position

3440.039 --> 3445.7990000000004
that will uh like entice others to like

3443.64 --> 3448.72
respond to her like hey hey don't you

3445.799 --> 3451.44
get it this is like wrong and she seems

3448.72 --> 3451.4399999999996
to like

3451.92 --> 3456.52
that she just likes the

3457.99 --> 3463.359
[Music]

3459.839 --> 3463.359
interactions that's what I

3469.599 --> 3475.6400000000003
think right there's no cohesion within

3472.599 --> 3477.559
her views that's really cohesive that

3475.64 --> 3481.2
she holds on to that she Compares

3477.559 --> 3481.2000000000003
everything to she doesn't do

3481.44 --> 3486.88
that she might compare one thing to

3484.24 --> 3489.16
another but she doesn't make it her own

3486.88 --> 3491.2000000000003
she doesn't like okay this is really

3489.16 --> 3494.1189999999997
true now let's compare everything to

3491.2 --> 3497.5989999999997
that she doesn't do

3494.119 --> 3499.52
that she just says no no like you say

3497.599 --> 3500.92
that that's true and that person says

3499.52 --> 3502.96
that that's true and this is what the

3500.92 --> 3506.7200000000003
government says is true and she just

3502.96 --> 3506.7200000000003
doesn't really even seem to take a

3507.0 --> 3510.24
a position then other than oh I feel

3509.319 --> 3515.0389999999998
like

3510.24 --> 3515.0389999999998
this about it right

3515.72 --> 3522.7599999999998
now or has have any of you caught her in

3520.079 --> 3525.6400000000003
actually really holding on to one

3522.76 --> 3526.88
principle throughout all of it has she

3525.64 --> 3532.0789999999997
been doing

3526.88 --> 3532.079
that anybody noticed that I

3533.72 --> 3536.72
haven't

3551.559 --> 3556.4
in a way I sort of see her like a soft

3553.88 --> 3559.88
troll a non-malignant

3556.4 --> 3562.039
troll somebody that doesn't really care

3559.88 --> 3563.92
likes to get things rolling she just

3562.039 --> 3566.4
likes the interaction not like the

3563.92 --> 3568.92
bullying and like people getting angry

3566.4 --> 3570.559
but she does like things rolling like

3568.92 --> 3573.079
things happening

3570.559 --> 3576.6800000000003
talking she seems to like

3573.079 --> 3581.88
that she gets a kick out of

3576.68 --> 3581.8799999999997
that so like a non-malignant troll

3583.4 --> 3587.0
almost akumu virus is a little bit like

3586.16 --> 3590.2799999999997
that

3587.0 --> 3590.28
too little

3593.64 --> 3600.48
bit

3596.319 --> 3600.48
soft trolls a good term yeah I thought

3616.119 --> 3622.799
so can hide non rench holers and one

3619.799 --> 3625.119
yeah that's cool steamy traveler but you

3622.799 --> 3628.839
can't do that while the show

3625.119 --> 3631.6400000000003

3637.079 --> 3641.319
there I remember you being there saying

3639.4 --> 3643.079
hello and then suddenly you didn't show

3641.319 --> 3645.16
up anymore and then I spotted you like

3643.079 --> 3648.0
saying hey I was

3645.16 --> 3650.16
banned but I had not seen any

3648.0 --> 3653.0
notification and I scrolled all the way

3650.16 --> 3655.44
back still during the live

3653.0 --> 3657.24
stream there was no no notification of

3655.44 --> 3660.68
you being banned so it was during the

3657.24 --> 3662.0
live stream no wrench can do that that's

3660.68 --> 3665.52
not how that

3662.0 --> 3667.96
works if it happens during a live stream

3665.52 --> 3670.559
it shows up in the

3667.96 --> 3674.319
chat that's how it

3670.559 --> 3674.3190000000004
works hey Akuma

3748.52 --> 3753.68
of like sickness or

3750.24 --> 3756.4399999999996

3756.44 --> 3762.68
three days a

3803.44 --> 3808.92
considered that though that that is

3805.68 --> 3808.9199999999996
indeed something that could be

4477.159 --> 4481.28
do most of the moderating it I mean the

4479.12 --> 4483.5199999999995
moderating can be handy when it's very

4481.28 --> 4486.599999999999
crowded in chat and I'm like on a long

weird thing to say

people tend to not like do IL legal

things out in the open in the middle of

daylight in a location where literally

4597.6 --> 4602.4400000000005

to not do illegal things out in the open

when they're the same age no it's

4670.4 --> 4675.879999999999
not you people don't use their body

4677.719 --> 4683.8
symmetrically people strain one side of

4681.12 --> 4687.5599999999995
their body very differently from the

other it's very logical that issues will

4687.56 --> 4689.84
be

4693.52 --> 4697.84
asymmetrical right that's why I'm having

4695.679 --> 4701.32
issues with my left shoulder and not

4697.84 --> 4703.88
also my right it's because I use my left

shoulder very differently from my my

4703.88 --> 4710.400000000001
right my right

4706.96 --> 4714.8
just is in too good a

4710.4 --> 4714.799999999999
condition cuz it is my primary

4715.44 --> 4721.48
side and I haven't like OV exhausted it

4718.88 --> 4725.0

4721.48 --> 4725.0
and probably not on the left

4729.33 --> 4734.92

4731.92 --> 4734.92

4744.56 --> 4748.679
okay well that still doesn't mean that

4746.92 --> 4750.36
you're that you're going to be perfectly

4748.679 --> 4754.52
symmetrical

4750.36 --> 4754.5199999999995
because that's not how people

4755.08 --> 4761.48
function you're going to have one

4757.239 --> 4765.599999999999
standing foot and one acting

4761.48 --> 4768.5199999999995
foot you're going to write with one

4765.6 --> 4772.280000000001
side and then have the other as a

4768.52 --> 4774.4400000000005
counterbalance that's just how people

4772.28 --> 4776.239
function you don't function

4774.44 --> 4778.28
symmetrically just because you're

4776.239 --> 4782.36
capable of doing the same thing with the

4778.28 --> 4782.36
other side doesn't mean that you always

4782.52 --> 4786.76
will you'll have a preferred

4791.84 --> 4794.84

4797.08 --> 4802.12
I knew she would do it what are you

what do I think of Richie escaping to

4855.6 --> 4860.400000000001
the Glo side she's not really

4858.08 --> 4862.4
escaping she's on the fence and she's

4860.4 --> 4865.04
going to be on the fence and now she's

4862.4 --> 4868.839999999999
hanging on the globe side of the fence

4865.04 --> 4868.84
she's still not coming off the

4869.08 --> 4874.36
fence I don't think that woman ever will

4871.56 --> 4876.400000000001
come off the fence I think that her feet

4874.36 --> 4879.92
might be cuffed

4876.4 --> 4882.239
cuffed to the to the top of the fence

4879.92 --> 4884.32
she can just hang on one side of the

4882.239 --> 4887.5199999999995
fence or the other but she's not coming

4884.32 --> 4887.5199999999995
off the fence ever

4891.84 --> 4898.08
care but I know that a lot of you really

5003.719 --> 5009.84
well or at least the

5006.32 --> 5011.84
top I think that my like my veins and my

skin are having a lot of trouble like

5011.84 --> 5017.1990000000005
cleaning this [ __ ] up and now it's like

5023.04 --> 5026.44
there thank

5031.4 --> 5036.199
got stung like this

5033.44 --> 5038.678999999999
by a big mosquito I think like two weeks

5036.199 --> 5040.719
ago and then like my entire hand got

5038.679 --> 5042.96
swollen up I didn't even say anything

5040.719 --> 5042.96
about

5050.76 --> 5055.2390000000005

5077.48 --> 5080.199
silly thing to

5080.639 --> 5087.04
say repetitive strain

5084.119 --> 5090.32
injury what are you talking about what

5087.04 --> 5093.8
strain there is literally no strain I

5090.32 --> 5096.48
don't like over use use that hand or

5093.8 --> 5100.8
anything it's my left

5096.48 --> 5100.799999999999
hand I barely use my left

5105.0 --> 5110.719
hand I haven't lifted any like really

5107.92 --> 5110.719
heavy things or

5112.48 --> 5117.599999999999
anything I don't haven't punched

5115.36 --> 5119.759999999999
anything especially with left I'd never

5117.6 --> 5122.400000000001
even do

5119.76 --> 5125.96
that I'd probably just hurt my wrist

5122.4 --> 5125.96
Miss but I did that with

5141.679 --> 5146.92
left you think guitars are the wrong way

5151.28 --> 5156.119
around

5153.119 --> 5156.119
maybe a spider

5156.48 --> 5161.159
bite no because that would actually

5161.719 --> 5166.52
hurt it's just an outof control mosquito

5164.679 --> 5169.52
bite it's like a mosquito bite where the

5166.52 --> 5173.280000000001
mosquito just had too much of that

5169.52 --> 5175.719
acid saved up it was probably a kind of

5173.28 --> 5175.719
a big

5179.84 --> 5185.119000000001
one I remember there being a

5182.719 --> 5188.84
like there was a really big mosquito

5185.119 --> 5191.0
that I thought was actually like the

5188.84 --> 5193.84
non-biting type of mosquito it was that

5191.0 --> 5197.04
big but apparently it wasn't so I

5193.84 --> 5200.0
suspect that that freaking thing did it

5197.04 --> 5202.199
it was like with its legs spread out it

5200.0 --> 5205.6
was like this

5202.199 --> 5208.04
big normal mosquitoes don't have legs

5205.6 --> 5209.400000000001
that big so I thought it wasn't like a

5208.04 --> 5210.88
mosquito it was one of those other

5209.4 --> 5213.599999999999
things that always flops around and

5210.88 --> 5215.56
everything but it was n it it was a

5213.6 --> 5218.280000000001
biting mosquito so I suspect that that

5215.56 --> 5223.96
was the the one that did

5218.28 --> 5226.5199999999995
it it's like a a swamp mosquito or

5223.96 --> 5228.4
something a big one that comes from the

5226.52 --> 5232.320000000001
Wilds not from

5228.4 --> 5232.32
like around the city

5241.119 --> 5244.119
area

5244.28 --> 5250.4
and by the way spiders don't bite

5246.88 --> 5250.400000000001
me we got a

5252.239 --> 5258.32
deal can weather change skull swelling

5262.56 --> 5268.360000000001
no weather change can like Sly make your

5266.159 --> 5272.28
muscles get more

5268.36 --> 5276.36
stiffish I've experienced that but swell

5272.28 --> 5276.36
in no no absolutely

5276.6 --> 5282.4800000000005
not unless you got some weird

5279.639 --> 5284.719
condition in in which that happens I

5282.48 --> 5286.879999999999
don't know about that sort of thing but

5284.719 --> 5289.76
that's definitely like an actual medical

5286.88 --> 5293.679
condition I don't have that this is a

5289.76 --> 5293.679
mosquito bite it

5294.6 --> 5299.119000000001
sucks I mean I've had big mosquito bites

5297.52 --> 5301.719
in the past one time I had like a

5299.119 --> 5304.04
mosquito bite on the side of my leg and

5301.719 --> 5309.679
the lump that came out of that was like

5304.04 --> 5314.08
this big it was like really like like

5309.679 --> 5318.32
a just a big bump

5314.08 --> 5318.32
freaky and that one actually kind of

5318.56 --> 5323.280000000001
hurt and it lasted for like 3

5324.44 --> 5331.0
days so sometimes I my body can like

5328.44 --> 5332.759999999999
have a big reaction on

5331.0 --> 5335.679
mosquitoes

5332.76 --> 5337.6
I show this to like my roommate and she

5335.679 --> 5340.08
says like oh that's like an allergy my

5337.6 --> 5342.639
brother has allergy to mosquitoes and

5340.08 --> 5345.28
she get he gets really swollen up by it

5342.639 --> 5348.92
too like that

5345.28 --> 5352.04
so maybe I am slightly allergic to it my

5348.92 --> 5354.639
mother really hated mosquitoes a

5352.04 --> 5357.719
lot she like she would get [ __ ] up

5354.639 --> 5361.0
from mosquitoes really

5357.719 --> 5362.44
badly like one time she actually got

5361.0 --> 5365.639
sick

5362.44 --> 5368.44
I got a fever from it I mean if she got

5365.639 --> 5371.76
into the hospital they could have

5368.44 --> 5373.759999999999
like said that she had malaria or

5371.76 --> 5377.0
something because that is what the

5373.76 --> 5379.679
symptoms typically are but she just got

5377.0 --> 5382.56
like an overdose of that or overdose she

5379.679 --> 5384.4
got a very high dose of like the

5382.56 --> 5387.080000000001
mosquito

5384.4 --> 5389.599999999999
acid and then your body can have a fever

5387.08 --> 5393.28
response to that that's actually what

5389.6 --> 5396.2390000000005
malaria is it's not actually a thing

5393.28 --> 5398.88
apparently I thought it was but

5396.239 --> 5398.879999999999
apparently it

5403.69 --> 5409.36
[Music]

5405.92 --> 5412.0

5409.36 --> 5413.92
cud what spiders cuddle up I don't know

5412.0 --> 5417.8
what you're talking about blue I don't

5413.92 --> 5417.8
know any spiders that like to cuddle

5418.679 --> 5424.92
up I mean we got a deal spiders don't

5421.96 --> 5424.92
walk on the floor

5424.96 --> 5432.56
here they go crawl on the wall sometimes

5429.159 --> 5434.28
and they all keep it like above half

5432.56 --> 5437.360000000001
they're always at the top half I don't

5434.28 --> 5440.239
see spiders walking around down here

5437.36 --> 5443.0
ever they like to stick in the in the

5440.239 --> 5445.44
corner of the of the

5443.0 --> 5448.199
ceiling and that's where I like them to

5445.44 --> 5451.5199999999995
be stuck that's where all the the bugs

5448.199 --> 5454.44
and also that that do come around fly

5451.52 --> 5456.52
into there so it's like a perfect setup

5454.44 --> 5459.919999999999
spiders go in a corner bugs go in the

5456.52 --> 5463.320000000001
corner spiders get food bugs are

5459.92 --> 5463.32

5467.84 --> 5475.32

5471.159 --> 5475.32
yeah the snakes don't crawl on

5480.76 --> 5483.76
walls

5489.32 --> 5493.84
there spiders left-handed or

5491.28 --> 5496.44
right-handed I missed that

5493.84 --> 5499.8
one I'm a

5496.44 --> 5499.799999999999
you you're

5504.36 --> 5509.159
hysterical but yeah a deal with that's

5506.88 --> 5510.76
called a spiritual deal it's an

5509.159 --> 5512.36
understanding

5510.76 --> 5514.360000000001
literally

5512.36 --> 5518.679
it's like a business deal like all they

5514.36 --> 5522.08
want was is just territory and food they

5518.679 --> 5524.2390000000005
want food traffic I'm very willing to

5522.08 --> 5525.88
provide them food traffic as long as

5524.239 --> 5529.36
they stay out

5525.88 --> 5533.28
of walking

5529.36 --> 5536.44
Zone and just that understanding is like

5533.28 --> 5538.5599999999995
a non-communication that's just I just

5536.44 --> 5541.159
radiate that it's like I'm always

5538.56 --> 5543.119000000001
telling the spiders these rules it's

5541.159 --> 5547.159
just an understanding that's here and

5543.119 --> 5547.159
I'm radiating that and they do

5548.08 --> 5553.159
it and now there's some creatures that

5550.56 --> 5554.92
literally don't obey that sort of thing

5553.159 --> 5557.96
by the way like

5554.92 --> 5559.639
Grasshoppers and crickets crickets are

5557.96 --> 5562.639
like they don't

5559.639 --> 5564.0
care and they easily like they'll get

5562.639 --> 5567.400000000001
right in front of you and just get

5564.0 --> 5570.639
stepped on like they just don't listen

5567.4 --> 5572.48
but spiders I've never stepped on a

5570.639 --> 5575.52
spider

5572.48 --> 5577.159
here because they don't get on the floor

5575.52 --> 5580.360000000001
because there's this understanding and

5577.159 --> 5580.36
they seem to follow

5581.239 --> 5585.4
it and I'm very happy about

5600.56 --> 5603.56
that

5604.96 --> 5610.4800000000005
okay Richard G well your spiders are

5608.08 --> 5612.84
annoying then I didn't don't have I

5610.48 --> 5614.879999999999
don't experience spiders trying to land

5612.84 --> 5617.6
on me or trying to make a web right

5614.88 --> 5620.88
above me I mean they make little bits of

5617.6 --> 5624.119000000001
webs there but they don't like try to

5620.88 --> 5629.4800000000005
make a huge web on the entire wall or

5624.119 --> 5629.48
something they don't do that luckily

5630.56 --> 5633.56
enough

5636.04 --> 5642.0
ah stepped on a snail in the

5638.52 --> 5644.92
garden feel like a m I know that feeling

5642.0 --> 5644.92
MMA it

5650.32 --> 5655.159
sucks it's like especially in the early

5653.04 --> 5656.719
mornings when it's like really moist and

5655.159 --> 5659.28
there's misted around and then you have

5656.719 --> 5661.159
like your garden and then the tiles and

5659.28 --> 5662.44
they always choose to like crawl right

5661.159 --> 5664.759999999999
over the

5662.44 --> 5666.719
tiles even though they basically have

5664.76 --> 5668.679
like the same color as the ties so you

5666.719 --> 5671.36
don't see them until you

5668.679 --> 5674.76

5960.04 --> 5963.04

[Music]

5990.04 --> 5993.04
socks

5994.52 --> 6000.2390000000005
does Neil the grass Tyson leave snail

6001.36 --> 6007.759999999999
Trails that's a very silly but very

6004.44 --> 6007.759999999999
funny question

6011.8 --> 6015.96
mfo he does seem kind of

6019.96 --> 6022.96
slow

6024.239 --> 6033.04
have you ever stood on NDT in your

6028.56 --> 6033.04
garden yep that stuff is

6033.24 --> 6036.3589999999995
[Music]

6049.92 --> 6052.92
flat

6069.679 --> 6075.639
I got this really silly little video in

6073.119 --> 6075.639
my head

6075.679 --> 6082.28
now of literally like a snail with Neil

6078.639 --> 6084.56
deest Tyson's face on it

6082.28 --> 6086.8
talking about the Earth being par shaped

6084.56 --> 6089.88
while it's literally crawling with the

6086.8 --> 6093.360000000001
camera like showing that towards the

6089.88 --> 6095.04
pear the pear is lying on tiles so it's

6093.36 --> 6096.719
crawling out of the grass towards the

6095.04 --> 6099.48
pear the pearshaped

6096.719 --> 6101.56
Earth technically par ship little chubby

6099.48 --> 6104.4
on the bottom and then somebody goes

6101.56 --> 6106.92
walking by and steps on NE the grass

6104.4 --> 6108.839999999999
ties and snail and it's splattered there

6106.92 --> 6111.88
and then it's like you hear Neil the

6108.84 --> 6113.599
grass Ty and say that stuff is FL

6111.88 --> 6117.159000000001
l

6113.599 --> 6120.639
i you're welcome and thank you mfo for

6117.159 --> 6120.638999999999
that idea that's really silly and

6127.159 --> 6132.638999999999
funny someone needs to make that you you

6129.719 --> 6135.599
have my full permission to do that it's

6132.639 --> 6138.28
my idea you can use that it's it just

6135.599 --> 6139.76
make it kind of cool it would be cool if

6138.28 --> 6144.759999999999
you like actually

6139.76 --> 6147.2390000000005
have like like a nature documentary type

6144.76 --> 6149.4800000000005
shot that you can have like the camera

6147.239 --> 6152.4
on the ground so you can really see the

6149.48 --> 6154.718999999999
snail crawling

6152.4 --> 6158.32
like it would be cool if it would made

6154.719 --> 6158.32
be made with a really serious good

6159.4 --> 6165.119
shot or you could animate it that's fine

6166.36 --> 6169.36
too

6169.76 --> 6172.76
anyway

6173.0 --> 6176.109
[Music]

6178.96 --> 6185.08
but it is kind of funny like to get a

6182.04 --> 6187.159
snail crawling with like Neil the grass

6185.08 --> 6190.159
Tyson's face on

6187.159 --> 6193.08
it and like just saying all these things

6190.159 --> 6195.92
like it's like you don't see the curve

6193.08 --> 6197.92
of the earth it's like that stuff is

6195.92 --> 6199.76
like a yeah pair of shape like the

6197.92 --> 6201.4800000000005
moments where he gets really excited

6199.76 --> 6203.52
about it right when he to argue for the

6201.48 --> 6205.919999999999
globe earth like especially those

6203.52 --> 6209.4800000000005
moments while he's crawling the snail's

6205.92 --> 6212.2390000000005
crawling really slow but like Neil the

6209.48 --> 6214.598999999999
grass toss Tyson talks really like

6212.239 --> 6218.199
hyperactive and enthusiastic and like

6214.599 --> 6221.400000000001
almost pissed off it's like no it's a

6218.199 --> 6224.719
Glo what's gravity I don't know next

6221.4 --> 6227.239
question all that [ __ ] just rambling on

6224.719 --> 6229.679
like very rapidly as the snails crawling

6227.239 --> 6232.36
really slowly towards the

6229.679 --> 6234.679
pear

6232.36 --> 6238.48
and then somebody steps on

6234.679 --> 6238.4800000000005
him that stuff is

6239.92 --> 6244.84
flat that could definitely work as a

6242.48 --> 6244.839999999999
funny

6250.599 --> 6258.32
sketch David after borrow invo no Pro no

6256.239 --> 6260.959999999999
I that's it's not it's about the shot

6258.32 --> 6262.32
quality Richard G not about the voice

6260.96 --> 6263.679
the voice is just going to be Neil the

6262.32 --> 6265.88
grass Tyson that's the voice you're

6263.679 --> 6268.28
going to be using for that because

6265.88 --> 6269.92
that's the F that makes it funny no

6268.28 --> 6271.88
other voice is there there's no

6269.92 --> 6274.32
description of the Neil theg grass Tyson

6271.88 --> 6276.639
or whatever no it's literally the snail

6274.32 --> 6279.159
just crawling there and Neil it's it is

6276.639 --> 6281.119
NE Rass Tyson he's like really

6279.159 --> 6283.96
enthusiastically trying to defend the

6281.119 --> 6286.48
ball while really slowly crawling

6283.96 --> 6286.4800000000005
towards the

6286.679 --> 6291.8
pair like and you could emphasize that

6289.84 --> 6295.76
even if you have the option to have like

6291.8 --> 6298.320000000001
different angled shots at the snail to

6295.76 --> 6301.360000000001
really emphasize how incredibly slow

6298.32 --> 6303.08
it's crawling and not just one side on

6301.36 --> 6306.119
shot that's just going to be really slow

6303.08 --> 6308.4
and boring right but act like almost

6306.119 --> 6310.5199999999995
like an action shot like who it's really

6308.4 --> 6312.598999999999
crawling towards the bear look at it

6310.52 --> 6314.8
from this angle look at it from that

6312.599 --> 6317.4400000000005
angle it's really crawling

6314.8 --> 6319.4400000000005
there but it's super slow but it still

6317.44 --> 6322.08
looks Acy and Neil the grass Tyson is

6319.44 --> 6324.5199999999995
all enthusiastic

6322.08 --> 6326.92
it's like no no you don't see the curve

6324.52 --> 6330.92
off the Earth that sort of thing right I

6326.92 --> 6330.92
mean that would be [ __ ]

6332.76 --> 6339.0
hilarious anybody creative

6335.639 --> 6342.56
can can put something like that

6339.0 --> 6342.56
together that would be

6345.4 --> 6351.239
awesome if I just get it like an idea

6348.52 --> 6353.400000000001
Arwin or whatever at the end in the

6351.239 --> 6355.598999999999
credits that would be great I don't need

6353.4 --> 6355.598999999999
any

6357.639 --> 6362.96
more or nothing whatever whatever you

6360.88 --> 6364.159000000001
require to make it I mean I'm not going

6362.96 --> 6366.44
to make it

6364.159 --> 6368.239
so if you don't want to put me on that

6366.44 --> 6369.96
list fine but somebody's going to make a

6368.239 --> 6372.45
video like that because it would be

6369.96 --> 6375.51
incredibly

6372.45 --> 6375.51
