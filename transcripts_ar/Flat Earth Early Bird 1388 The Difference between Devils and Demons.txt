it cooled off quite a bit

115.14 --> 121.64

117.92 --> 121.64
grayish Cloud Mass

122.7 --> 129.0
hasn't been any rain over here or so far

125.82 --> 131.899

129.0 --> 131.899
at the moment

134.28 --> 138.66
all right but I I'm missing the Sun from

136.92 --> 140.04

339.18 --> 346.5
the people that got the wrenches

343.56 --> 349.02
yeah I don't need wrenches to be brave

346.5 --> 351.44

couple of good shows recently I think

483.91 --> 486.949
[Music]

486.96 --> 495.0
that's also how I then basically come

490.74 --> 498.72
to figure out a title for the shows

495.0 --> 500.52
uh a terror 306

498.72 --> 503.12
no notifications

500.52 --> 503.12
okay

507.66 --> 510.5
that's weird

513.32 --> 522.33
[Music]

528.56 --> 532.3389999999999
yesterday's show was fun yeah

532.68 --> 537.42

536.05 --> 539.0999999999999
[Music]

537.42 --> 542.959
literature

539.1 --> 542.9590000000001
hey Tony Whitcomb

545.15 --> 549.84
[Music]

546.98 --> 553.149
Cody box I don't even know what that is

549.84 --> 553.149
[Music]

559.92 --> 566.279
is that some form of desktop computer or

563.399 --> 569.36
something I don't know what yeah wait

566.279 --> 569.36
welcome to the show

575.519 --> 582.21
so I'm all caught up

577.98 --> 583.5600000000001
with own Benjamin streams

582.21 --> 586.26
[Music]

583.56 --> 587.76
did a Saturday stream too and yeah

586.26 --> 589.73
making

587.76 --> 592.769
good points

589.73 --> 592.769
[Music]

602.279 --> 606.26
the media console okay

609.77 --> 622.679
[Music]

628.94 --> 635.1
I won't be active okay great

632.58 --> 637.8000000000001
I don't feel super active myself I mean

635.1 --> 639.48
yesterday was just yeah it was a great

637.8 --> 641.0999999999999
flow but

639.48 --> 643.38
when the weather just changes around

641.1 --> 646.22
like this then usually I tend to change

643.38 --> 646.22
around as well

646.92 --> 651.56
but I don't know you could still make

648.72 --> 651.5600000000001
something out of it

660.62 --> 666.9590000000001
right yeah I know I know about media

663.839 --> 669.6600000000001
consoles I've never had one but

666.959 --> 672.38
yeah one of my friends

669.66 --> 675.48
from the not too distant past

672.38 --> 678.18
was actually into

675.48 --> 680.7
I think like was even like a programmer

678.18 --> 684.3
as part of a company to actually program

680.7 --> 689.12
media consoles systems

684.3 --> 689.12
so I've heard some things about it

689.16 --> 695.36
it reminds me of the

691.8 --> 695.3599999999999
the modified Xbox

695.459 --> 701.399
like a hacked modified Xbox there was

699.0 --> 703.44
also a media console worked really well

701.399 --> 706.26
for the time being

703.44 --> 708.6600000000001
I've seen one of those in action

706.26 --> 711.2
for another friend of mine from even

708.66 --> 711.1999999999999
further back

712.74 --> 715.92
no not further back actually

714.5 --> 718.92
[Music]

715.92 --> 718.92
anyway

740.82 --> 744.86
[Music]

742.459 --> 748.049
right so

744.86 --> 748.049
[Music]

749.76 --> 755.88
I addressed the guys yesterday in Skype

752.779 --> 757.62
also in relation to uh lva Paul leaving

755.88 --> 760.9399999999999
and all that

757.62 --> 760.94
from their Skype groups

761.04 --> 767.399
about my opinion uh

764.04 --> 772.16
about what we should do

767.399 --> 772.16
like in the face of this globuster stuff

772.22 --> 778.519
which some of the guys are very eager to

775.079 --> 781.4399999999999
go after and yeah of course I mean

778.519 --> 784.92
material wise logical wise yeah there's

781.44 --> 786.72
plenty of reason for that I'm just I try

784.92 --> 788.76
to warn them like these guys are

786.72 --> 790.62
literally just trying to drag us down

788.76 --> 793.38
with them and

790.62 --> 795.0
yes they're revealing themselves to

793.38 --> 797.24
Their audience but Their audience is

795.0 --> 797.24
already

797.88 --> 802.88
has already set through a whole bunch of

800.76 --> 805.68
stuff with them

802.88 --> 809.04
and they're not very likely to really

805.68 --> 811.019
care that much about it I mean

809.04 --> 813.0
people

811.019 --> 815.04
that would have dropped because of this

813.0 --> 818.399
sort of behavior probably would have

815.04 --> 820.4399999999999
already dropped when jiren was going

818.399 --> 823.5
back and forth with like Flat Earth

820.44 --> 824.519
[ __ ] or just Jake the [ __ ] I don't

823.5 --> 825.779
know

824.519 --> 828.12
that guy

825.779 --> 830.36
because that was super trashy so it's

828.12 --> 830.36
like

831.72 --> 838.139
it's just not really gonna matter and

834.48 --> 842.48
we're not gonna get new Subs out of this

838.139 --> 842.48
because those subs have already found us

842.519 --> 849.3
anyway it's Technical and

846.779 --> 851.82
I got the feeling that not everybody was

849.3 --> 853.56
actually in wanting to listen to me

851.82 --> 855.1500000000001
about it

853.56 --> 858.27
so we'll just see what happens

855.15 --> 858.27
[Music]

861.959 --> 868.1389999999999
but my point was uh I think that we

865.019 --> 873.0600000000001
should just let globusters burn out burn

868.139 --> 874.92
itself out over this [ __ ] and continue

873.06 --> 876.3599999999999
actually

874.92 --> 878.959
yeah

876.36 --> 881.82
two more

878.959 --> 884.16
recent events and all that to more

881.82 --> 888.1800000000001
current things so that we stay on target

884.16 --> 890.76
and don't like basically start burn down

888.18 --> 892.2299999999999
as well with them

890.76 --> 894.42
then we'll see

892.23 --> 897.12
[Music]

894.42 --> 899.279
what happens

897.12 --> 901.44
I mean QE is not going to be stopped for

899.279 --> 904.4399999999999
once you know

901.44 --> 906.0
after that Friday stream I mean that guy

904.44 --> 907.4590000000001
is just

906.0 --> 910.079
foreign

907.459 --> 912.899
yeah he brought the flamethrower and

910.079 --> 915.2399999999999
everything so qe's not gonna stop right

912.899 --> 916.68
I don't even need to address him about

915.24 --> 917.76
that

916.68 --> 921.5999999999999
but

917.76 --> 923.699
the rest of fed I think that oh flat so

921.6 --> 924.899
it's like really getting on to it too

923.699 --> 927.66
now and

924.899 --> 931.579
they're all just diving in

927.66 --> 931.579
I'm like is this really worth it

932.04 --> 938.399
I mean when people dive this low right

935.42 --> 939.8
ranty style I mean Jaren is kind of

938.399 --> 943.139
following

939.8 --> 945.4799999999999
grantee pattern that's how I what it

943.139 --> 948.3
looks like to me

945.48 --> 950.22
maybe worse

948.3 --> 952.68
but it's just like

950.22 --> 954.9590000000001
that stepping away

952.68 --> 957.3599999999999
stepping down into the darkness

954.959 --> 960.779
blatantly

957.36 --> 962.82
and just trying to get others agitated

960.779 --> 964.8
with you so they're Bound to You right

962.82 --> 965.94
that's what Randy tried to do all the

964.8 --> 968.8199999999999
time

965.94 --> 971.1
in the end and

968.82 --> 973.9200000000001
it feels like jiren's just doing the

971.1 --> 976.88
same thing and if we just give him what

973.92 --> 979.38
he wants every time by addressing every

976.88 --> 980.88
[ __ ] little fallacy and projection

979.38 --> 984.56
straw man

980.88 --> 984.56
every single time yeah then

984.6 --> 989.4200000000001
that would not make him stop

990.12 --> 996.6
probably would not actually make his

992.88 --> 998.88
channel like Buckle under that either

996.6 --> 1001.88
because if it would have buckled it it

998.88 --> 1005.24
would have already done that

1001.88 --> 1007.779
because of previous engagements

1005.24 --> 1007.779
anyway

1008.48 --> 1014.72
I'm getting all very tactical here

1011.839 --> 1016.759
it just all seems like a waste of time

1014.72 --> 1018.0790000000001
like a waste of energy like I don't

1016.759 --> 1020.839
wanna

1018.079 --> 1023.18
I'm like I don't care anymore

1020.839 --> 1026.54
about this [ __ ]

1023.18 --> 1028.579
not really I mean I'll laugh over the

1026.54 --> 1030.86
latest silly thing that Whitsett or

1028.579 --> 1034.04
Jaron has said now

1030.86 --> 1037.2199999999998
but I just

1034.04 --> 1039.5
it's old it's just like this is not

1037.22 --> 1041.1200000000001
really important to anything really it's

1039.5 --> 1043.579
just

1041.12 --> 1046.1599999999999
yeah

1043.579 --> 1048.459
they're disconnecting they're jumping

1046.16 --> 1048.459
ship

1048.919 --> 1051.64
let him

1056.66 --> 1061.22
right you don't owe them like a life

1059.299 --> 1063.23
raft or anything

1061.22 --> 1065.299
they they jump the ship

1063.23 --> 1068.919

1103.58 --> 1107.4399999999998

yeah I really recommend you just kind of

you smell a cave it's stinky what do you

1318.32 --> 1323.4189999999999
do you follow your nose you don't go

1320.78 --> 1326.2
into the stink in the hopes of finding a

1323.419 --> 1326.2
gobble in there

1327.44 --> 1334.64
you move away

1331.4 --> 1338.179
the piece of [ __ ] is best just forgotten

nobody

you can't remember who he no I not but I

1345.38 --> 1350.96
just know that look I know

1348.02 --> 1353.12
it's like the way he looks and the way

1350.96 --> 1355.1000000000001
he moves I immediately wrecked out that

1353.12 --> 1358.039
piece of [ __ ] I don't even know his name

1355.1 --> 1361.9399999999998
I don't care I just recognize that that

1358.039 --> 1364.4
face and I know that's a piece of [ __ ]

1361.94 --> 1366.5
that's all I need to know

1364.4 --> 1368.679
and just immediately click the video

1366.5 --> 1368.679
away

1373.28 --> 1377.24
these scummy trolls that like to stalk

1375.74 --> 1379.58
my channel

1377.24 --> 1381.2
I think that they probably feel the same

1379.58 --> 1385.46
about me

1381.2 --> 1388.039
but then they go here every day to try

1385.46 --> 1391.28
to share that

1388.039 --> 1394.01

1492.919 --> 1496.1200000000001
was well aware of that

1521.96 --> 1527.779
Nathan hasn't actually told us or not me

1525.32 --> 1528.86
at least not in the Skype chat maybe you

1527.779 --> 1532.46
like

1528.86 --> 1535.779
told somebody on private chat but

1532.46 --> 1535.779
I don't know about it

1537.02 --> 1540.82
I'll sleep with one eye open

1543.32 --> 1551.84
I'm walking in a spooky Forest

1546.58 --> 1554.96
streamed partnership no no it's

1551.84 --> 1557.72
it's kind of like an alliance

1554.96 --> 1560.1200000000001
like being battle partners

1557.72 --> 1562.039
both with their own specialty and we're

1560.12 --> 1565.2199999999998
just like

1562.039 --> 1567.98
teaming up like an adventuring group

1565.22 --> 1571.64
and we work well together

1567.98 --> 1574.88
and we've had our stats it's not like oh

1571.64 --> 1578.0590000000002
we're married or something no

1574.88 --> 1580.22
no no no no Nathan gets very irritated

1578.059 --> 1582.62
by me sometimes and then I don't

1580.22 --> 1585.8600000000001
understand even why and other times I

1582.62 --> 1587.539
get really irritated too

1585.86 --> 1590.4799999999998
and then he doesn't really understand

1587.539 --> 1593.779
and we're working it out the point is is

1590.48 --> 1597.559
that we I I think

1593.779 --> 1600.76
and he too feels that it's in his

1597.559 --> 1600.76
interest to basically

1601.1 --> 1604.539
not [ __ ] all over me

1605.179 --> 1609.0800000000002
right and I don't know I don't know how

1607.58 --> 1610.8799999999999
much he likes me I think he likes me

1609.08 --> 1612.1399999999999
sometimes and other times he's just like

1610.88 --> 1614.5390000000002
okay

1612.14 --> 1617.9
he doesn't know I don't know Nathan is

1614.539 --> 1620.48
not like super sharing like that I mean

1617.9 --> 1623.8600000000001
I am a complete blabbermouth so I always

1620.48 --> 1623.8600000000001
try to describe everything

1623.96 --> 1630.02
but Nathan is a little bit more reserved

1627.86 --> 1632.24
sometimes he opens a book and then just

1630.02 --> 1634.34
starts talking about his opinions and

1632.24 --> 1638.14
insights but

1634.34 --> 1638.1399999999999
that's not a daily thing

1638.299 --> 1641.2
like with me

1644.179 --> 1648.0800000000002
but yeah it's not that strange a

1646.52 --> 1650.96
partnership

1648.08 --> 1655.76
it's just like

1650.96 --> 1658.8400000000001
a non-contractual business relationship

1655.76 --> 1658.84
that's basically it

1663.1 --> 1669.6789999999999
or Allies as you would call it

1666.98 --> 1671.3600000000001
I mean in media land here in the Flat

1669.679 --> 1674.1200000000001
Earth scene especially

1671.36 --> 1677.36
there's no real contractual Partnerships

1674.12 --> 1679.1589999999999
really that I've seen maybe some other

1677.36 --> 1681.3799999999999
but mostly it's just people and they're

1679.159 --> 1683.659
just like yeah you're good at this I'm

1681.38 --> 1685.5200000000002
good at that we can handle each other we

1683.659 --> 1686.8400000000001
can deal with each other's strengths and

1685.52 --> 1687.799
weaknesses and

1686.84 --> 1689.6
yeah

1687.799 --> 1692.559
partners

1689.6 --> 1692.559
or Allies

1692.659 --> 1697.4
right and in a way

1695.059 --> 1700.039
Nathan has made a lot of effort in the

1697.4 --> 1702.74
past to even like

1700.039 --> 1706.52
to form an alliance with globusters

1702.74 --> 1710.299
despite the massive differences and

1706.52 --> 1714.26
heavy issues he's really tried that

1710.299 --> 1716.84
openly on this show like like years

1714.26 --> 1719.179
he has done that even when I personally

1716.84 --> 1721.22
was like ah why are you taller why are

1719.179 --> 1724.1000000000001
you promoting them

1721.22 --> 1726.679
they're like no no no no no

1724.1 --> 1731.1399999999999
right so he's the one that actually made

1726.679 --> 1731.14
the most effort to forge alliances

1731.179 --> 1735.679
and

1732.919 --> 1737.3600000000001
yeah well that has obviously completely

1735.679 --> 1739.0700000000002
blown up

1737.36 --> 1740.4189999999999
and not by his doing

1739.07 --> 1744.3999999999999
[Music]

1740.419 --> 1744.4
he made all the effort he could and

1747.44 --> 1751.299
but it still turned out like this

1751.94 --> 1754.72
hey Cleary

1759.5 --> 1764.419
thanks for the support what

1762.2 --> 1766.8990000000001
no you thank you for the support five

1764.419 --> 1766.8990000000001
ropes

1778.58 --> 1783.6399999999999
oh you're starting a new painting that

1780.86 --> 1783.6399999999999
sounds awesome

1785.299 --> 1789.399
flat cotton earthers what

1790.1 --> 1792.8799999999999
what do you mean

1792.98 --> 1797.24
oh

1794.419 --> 1799.5800000000002
flat convention earthers that's

1797.24 --> 1801.94
interesting that's an interesting way to

1799.58 --> 1801.9399999999998
say it

1806.48 --> 1810.64
but

1807.86 --> 1810.6399999999999
yeah

1814.94 --> 1819.02
I mean I've been to a convention too one

1817.399 --> 1821.0
time

1819.02 --> 1823.539
does that make me a flat convention

1821.0 --> 1823.539
earther

1823.58 --> 1827.72
but I I understand what you mean it's

1825.62 --> 1830.1789999999999
always those same people that are like

1827.72 --> 1833.14
always trying to be on a convention be

1830.179 --> 1833.14
the hot item

1836.14 --> 1841.2990000000002
all right

1837.86 --> 1841.299
and selling their stuff

1848.18 --> 1863.319
[Music]

1864.32 --> 1869.4189999999999
right I could probably do some of that

1866.84 --> 1872.299
myself but I think that

1869.419 --> 1874.5200000000002
by now the way that I've basically

1872.299 --> 1876.32
developed myself

1874.52 --> 1877.8799999999999
I don't think there's a lot of people

1876.32 --> 1880.46
out there that are going to be really

1877.88 --> 1882.2
friendly towards me on the flatter side

1880.46 --> 1884.779
like when it comes to business they'll

1882.2 --> 1885.6200000000001
be too skinny scared of something I

1884.779 --> 1888.32
don't know

1885.62 --> 1890.539
and I have not exactly like made

1888.32 --> 1893.86
merchandise or anything

1890.539 --> 1893.86
or written books

1904.899 --> 1910.2199999999998
Paragon of BS okay well then I don't

1908.36 --> 1912.4599999999998
know I don't even know what Jaron is

1910.22 --> 1912.46
like

1912.559 --> 1918.02
really

1913.94 --> 1919.3990000000001
in private I've seen him a bit

1918.02 --> 1922.46
uh

1919.399 --> 1925.039
like in 2019

1922.46 --> 1926.8990000000001
and he was not exactly

1925.039 --> 1929.72
cool

1926.899 --> 1932.1789999999999
it was not nice

1929.72 --> 1934.3990000000001
to me at least

1932.179 --> 1936.97
I didn't never really got why I mean

1934.399 --> 1939.1399999999999
like what did I ever do

1936.97 --> 1942.14
[Music]

1939.14 --> 1942.14
foreign

1948.679 --> 1953.15
I've tried it's just it all seems

1951.74 --> 1955.279
pointless to me

1953.15 --> 1958.3400000000001
[Music]

1955.279 --> 1961.039
I mean I'm already writing a book

1958.34 --> 1962.6
dictating it through my shows I'm

1961.039 --> 1965.12
explaining it re-explaining it

1962.6 --> 1970.059
re-explaining it re-explaining it

1965.12 --> 1970.059
figuring out new connections refining it

1970.159 --> 1975.679
I mean if I write a book then either

1973.52 --> 1977.24
it's going to take forever for me to

1975.679 --> 1980.179
write it because I'm constantly updating

1977.24 --> 1981.679
it or it's just oh I'm writing it this

1980.179 --> 1984.0800000000002
is how it is and then it's like

1981.679 --> 1986.8600000000001
immediately outdated

1984.08 --> 1986.86
immediately

1990.14 --> 1995.24
all right this has always been my

1992.0 --> 1997.399
problem with like writing books

1995.24 --> 2000.519
is that your ideas

1997.399 --> 2002.7399999999998
like migrate new insights take place new

2000.519 --> 2004.25
events change things and then it's just

2002.74 --> 2005.919
outdated

2004.25 --> 2008.86
[Music]

2005.919 --> 2011.5590000000002
right unless you're like writing about

2008.86 --> 2013.36
history or something

2011.559 --> 2016.799
history is not going to be outdated

2013.36 --> 2019.6
anytime soon but I mean even like the

2016.799 --> 2022.44
understandings of History are like

2019.6 --> 2025.84
rearranging over our current linear time

2022.44 --> 2030.0
so in that sense even history is not

2025.84 --> 2030.0
exactly super stable

2031.059 --> 2035.2
uh

2032.38 --> 2036.519
right so what I am more is just I don't

2035.2 --> 2041.1000000000001
write books

2036.519 --> 2041.1
to sell I share words

2041.62 --> 2048.04
I just explain it and I can do it live

2044.44 --> 2052.2000000000003
like on the spot everything I do here

2048.04 --> 2052.2
I can do in person

2052.96 --> 2055.96
interactively

2072.52 --> 2079.3
right yeah Lennox I mean

2075.94 --> 2081.2200000000003
the base book I still remember the

2079.3 --> 2083.02
impossible book

2081.22 --> 2089.7
from

2083.02 --> 2089.7
is it 2 2010 or 2011 or something

2090.339 --> 2096.879
that was crazy

2091.96 --> 2099.4
but uh yeah the book I mean

2096.879 --> 2100.7799999999997
the way Eric Dubai has written it is

2099.4 --> 2104.08
like

2100.78 --> 2105.94
he's written it like half Globe skeptic

2104.08 --> 2110.14
and half

2105.94 --> 2112.0
just almost like mythological references

2110.14 --> 2114.16
things that have ideas that have been

2112.0 --> 2118.78
said about it like the very early

2114.16 --> 2120.339
attempts to really model the realm but

2118.78 --> 2122.079
there's a lot off with it and there's

2120.339 --> 2124.2999999999997
probably some misinformation in there

2122.079 --> 2126.76
but that's not yeah

2124.3 --> 2128.619
we can't check right can't get there

2126.76 --> 2131.1400000000003
like about what's actually at the North

2128.619 --> 2133.599
Pole etc etc

2131.14 --> 2135.7599999999998
so that's how Dubai does it and he

2133.599 --> 2138.7000000000003
always keeps that same pattern so it's

2135.76 --> 2143.5
like the very Globe skeptic oriented as

2138.7 --> 2146.3199999999997
in oh this is the Flat Earth model this

2143.5 --> 2149.5
is more logical than the assumption that

2146.32 --> 2151.3590000000004
the sun is so 93 million miles away

2149.5 --> 2153.22
right

2151.359 --> 2155.68
so I was always playing into that

2153.22 --> 2157.5989999999997
dichotomy as a globe skeptic which is

2155.68 --> 2161.3799999999997
very 2015.

2157.599 --> 2164.079
but effective enough

2161.38 --> 2166.0
although technically wrong it doesn't

2164.079 --> 2169.1800000000003
really matter that much

2166.0 --> 2172.24
it's going to help for the

2169.18 --> 2175.9199999999996
yeah for the normies ETC and for just

2172.24 --> 2175.9199999999996
people that are stumbling into this

2176.56 --> 2181.119
right but when it comes to Mechanical

2179.02 --> 2186.359
Precision no

2181.119 --> 2186.359
Eric Dubey is not really all that great

2186.88 --> 2192.7000000000003
doesn't really matter though he's a he's

2189.7 --> 2195.339
a great narrator he's very good at that

2192.7 --> 2198.3999999999996
and he's made a whole bunch of videos

2195.339 --> 2202.06
small and big that are just kind of

2198.4 --> 2205.26
interesting to listen to and

2202.06 --> 2205.2599999999998
you do learn something

2210.88 --> 2215.619
right but he doesn't seem all that up to

2214.359 --> 2217.2999999999997
date with the Flat Earth debate

2215.619 --> 2220.48
arguments and all that

2217.3 --> 2222.76
or or even interested doesn't seem

2220.48 --> 2225.2400000000002
particularly interested

2222.76 --> 2225.2400000000002
right

2225.94 --> 2230.88
create narrator for sleep

2228.28 --> 2230.88
okay

2235.06 --> 2237.66
Maybe

2243.9 --> 2248.2200000000003
I guess you don't like him too much

2256.48 --> 2262.66
oh okay Thor Casey yeah well I was

2259.96 --> 2265.359
taught that write things down so you

2262.66 --> 2267.8799999999997
have your thoughts more organized and I

2265.359 --> 2270.22
did actually learn to do that

2267.88 --> 2273.0
my problem isn't that my thoughts aren't

2270.22 --> 2273.0
organized

2273.04 --> 2277.119
I've learned that

2274.839 --> 2279.7
I I can do that without writing things

2277.119 --> 2280.0
down I have a very organized internal

2279.7 --> 2281.3199999999997
mind

2280.0 --> 2285.46
[Music]

2281.32 --> 2288.4
I like neurotically actually that's

2285.46 --> 2290.619
why when I clean something I clean it

2288.4 --> 2294.1600000000003
like a professional and that's why I

2290.619 --> 2296.579
keep my computer super organized and

2294.16 --> 2296.5789999999997
tidy

2297.16 --> 2304.42
so I don't have like the chaotic mind I

2301.66 --> 2307.06
I kind of had more like that in my teens

2304.42 --> 2309.2200000000003
where it was like really hard for me to

2307.06 --> 2310.859
focus like really hard

2309.22 --> 2314.5
just couldn't

2310.859 --> 2317.74
I can't get my mind straight right I

2314.5 --> 2320.5
don't have that issue anymore at all

2317.74 --> 2323.9199999999996
I've trained that like pretty much my

2320.5 --> 2327.339
entire life as in if I don't get this my

2323.92 --> 2329.44
entire life will be completely wasted

2327.339 --> 2333.7599999999998
so this is what I have to do I have to

2329.44 --> 2333.76
learn to focus without drugs

2335.68 --> 2341.44
and I have to just get that and just

2338.56 --> 2343.119
keep training that forever until this is

2341.44 --> 2344.84
no longer a problem and I've done that

2343.119 --> 2346.54
for

2344.84 --> 2350.2200000000003
[Music]

2346.54 --> 2350.22
arguably 30 years

2350.32 --> 2353.82
feeling worked out great

2360.4 --> 2368.579
why do you think you're a turret

2364.48 --> 2368.579
I mean he just put out another video

2368.619 --> 2371.46
an hour ago

2376.119 --> 2379.6800000000003
hey jedo good to see you

2388.92 --> 2395.859
when Dubai was dressing up like if he's

2393.28 --> 2398.26
calling everybody's shells now that was

2395.859 --> 2399.339
before the Flat Earth debate days then

2398.26 --> 2403.599
Lennox

2399.339 --> 2403.599
yeah that was like 2015-16

2405.76 --> 2408.42
but

2408.64 --> 2413.52
at the time he was going after

2411.579 --> 2416.02
absolutely everyone

2413.52 --> 2419.2
including Nathan

2416.02 --> 2421.96
and Antonio super rats

2419.2 --> 2426.7799999999997
at the time when Patricia's there and

2421.96 --> 2426.78
everybody that was kind of relevant

2427.359 --> 2430.56
I remember that

2431.26 --> 2437.5
he also did not like me very much and

2433.78 --> 2444.6400000000003
called me like a Jew and all that is

2437.5 --> 2448.06
so like yeah he was very Savanna but

2444.64 --> 2450.4
I really believe he got out of that

2448.06 --> 2452.7999999999997
he stopped doing that he's he's like

2450.4 --> 2456.579
more focused less

2452.8 --> 2458.98
gamma and rage more secure and that's a

2456.579 --> 2460.78
good thing I like that

2458.98 --> 2463.2400000000002
foreign

2460.78 --> 2464.92
but I think that that he actually

2463.24 --> 2466.5989999999997
believed that I think that he was

2464.92 --> 2469.3
severely paranoid

2466.599 --> 2471.46
about other flat earthers and probably

2469.3 --> 2475.0600000000004
for good reason because

2471.46 --> 2477.64
I've had really creepy experiences

2475.06 --> 2478.839
like that too

2477.64 --> 2480.7
right

2478.839 --> 2483.099
like

2480.7 --> 2485.4399999999996
satanists

2483.099 --> 2487.599
that would be like yeah Flat Earth and

2485.44 --> 2490.9
then

2487.599 --> 2492.76
basically lay out really dark [ __ ] it's

2490.9 --> 2495.88
like

2492.76 --> 2497.7400000000002
people out there have like sewn

2495.88 --> 2500.5
secretly

2497.74 --> 2501.7599999999998
dream paranoia about Flat Earth and flat

2500.5 --> 2504.339
earthers

2501.76 --> 2508.48
and so that most of that is secret that

2504.339 --> 2511.9
that was even before the internet for me

2508.48 --> 2513.52
right and I bet that Eric debase had a

2511.9 --> 2515.44
whole bunch of those types of experience

2513.52 --> 2518.68
as well so it was very scary don't

2515.44 --> 2520.359
forget for me getting on with letter

2518.68 --> 2521.859
scene and even just starting my Channel

2520.359 --> 2525.8199999999997
with my face

2521.859 --> 2527.44
was extremely scary at the time that was

2525.82 --> 2529.96
like

2527.44 --> 2532.48
I gotta do this but I feel I'm gonna die

2529.96 --> 2537.76
I feel that I'm not gonna survive this

2532.48 --> 2541.48
if I do this but I couldn't not do it

2537.76 --> 2543.579
because of the threats that I had

2541.48 --> 2546.94
perceived

2543.579 --> 2550.2000000000003
against Flat Earth before all that

2546.94 --> 2550.2000000000003
pretty severe

2552.94 --> 2558.94
right but for some reason After the

2556.359 --> 2562.72
flood Earth Awakening through YouTube

2558.94 --> 2564.7000000000003
I'd never that never really returned the

2562.72 --> 2567.9399999999996
actual scary threats

2564.7 --> 2570.7599999999998
those people I don't know them anymore

2567.94 --> 2572.44
they haven't like sought me out and like

2570.76 --> 2574.3
hey I see you're a flat Earth and now

2572.44 --> 2576.64
I'd like to remind you blah blah no no

2574.3 --> 2579.88
nothing no contact

2576.64 --> 2583.06
right instead we get all the anti-flat

2579.88 --> 2584.859
Earth or polit politicians right because

2583.06 --> 2586.42
they are kind of like politicians these

2584.859 --> 2590.16
anti-flat earthers

2586.42 --> 2594.579
very much like the politicians

2590.16 --> 2598.18
tactics stance tenacity

2594.579 --> 2601.119
and just oblivious ignorance

2598.18 --> 2603.04
right when it's convenient for them

2601.119 --> 2605.079
that's very political very different

2603.04 --> 2606.64
from what I experienced before the Flat

2605.079 --> 2611.02
Earth awakened

2606.64 --> 2613.66
did you die LOL well no apparently not

2611.02 --> 2614.68
but I definitely think I was going to

2613.66 --> 2617.0789999999997
die

2614.68 --> 2620.0789999999997
that people were gonna come after me and

2617.079 --> 2622.78
assassinate me because of it yeah akumu

2620.079 --> 2626.079
virus I did actually think that and it's

2622.78 --> 2628.42
not [ __ ] funny okay I had actual

2626.079 --> 2631.78
nightmares

2628.42 --> 2634.359
it was really scary

2631.78 --> 2636.7000000000003
and actual nightmares in my dreams that

2634.359 --> 2638.92
[ __ ] happened and I suspected it's

2636.7 --> 2641.9199999999996
through like astral projection people

2638.92 --> 2645.16
just projecting that [ __ ] onto me

2641.92 --> 2648.599
and in the real world also even way back

2645.16 --> 2648.5989999999997
like Flat Earth

2648.94 --> 2654.46
just

2650.5 --> 2656.619
in School Flat Earth came up but not

2654.46 --> 2659.38
like that it's just like the doubt of

2656.619 --> 2661.06
globe model Etc I was just really

2659.38 --> 2663.4
interested in trying to figure out

2661.06 --> 2665.2599999999998
information and when I then dove into

2663.4 --> 2667.9
basically forbidden information that's

2665.26 --> 2671.38
Globe denying there were people like

2667.9 --> 2674.56
even fellow students we're talking about

2671.38 --> 2678.579
people that are like 16.

2674.56 --> 2680.14
right that were so triggered by it that

2678.579 --> 2682.7200000000003
they actually

2680.14 --> 2685.9
like really threatened me

2682.72 --> 2688.839
like like said like if you don't shut up

2685.9 --> 2692.02
about this I'm gonna make sure you will

2688.839 --> 2693.46
never have a job your entire life

2692.02 --> 2695.38
right

2693.46 --> 2698.92
and then we're gonna find where you live

2695.38 --> 2701.7400000000002
that sort of [ __ ] okay that's not just

2698.92 --> 2705.54
of oh you're a stupid flutter no actual

2701.74 --> 2705.54
really serious [ __ ] threats

2708.16 --> 2714.1189999999997
okay not funny

2710.74 --> 2714.1189999999997
really scary

2714.94 --> 2719.92
so that's what I've experienced way

2717.28 --> 2721.9
before all this [ __ ] yeah so to

2719.92 --> 2726.04
certainly see how the entire scene had

2721.9 --> 2728.38
changed was really like baffling to me I

2726.04 --> 2729.52
had not expected that all of this would

2728.38 --> 2732.2200000000003
just happen

2729.52 --> 2736.18
like it did

2732.22 --> 2738.9399999999996
because in 2015 2016 when I came out

2736.18 --> 2741.3999999999996
I was like okay I got like a year to

2738.94 --> 2743.38
live what can I do in this year and then

2741.4 --> 2745.2400000000002
after that year is like wait what

2743.38 --> 2749.319
nothing happened

2745.24 --> 2751.359
oh okay okay maybe it's more time we'll

2749.319 --> 2753.94
see how long this goes and I'm still

2751.359 --> 2757.02
going right now

2753.94 --> 2757.02
seven years later

2759.28 --> 2763.3190000000004
so

2761.079 --> 2763.319
yeah

2768.52 --> 2775.359
it didn't turn out to be as extremely

2772.839 --> 2780.099
dangerous as I thought but I have been

2775.359 --> 2782.319
threatened very seriously over this and

2780.099 --> 2784.3
by the way in a time when I was

2782.319 --> 2785.74
absolutely not

2784.3 --> 2789.099
capable

2785.74 --> 2791.74
of like defending myself spiritually as

2789.099 --> 2794.1400000000003
well as I've learned to do by now

2791.74 --> 2796.5989999999997
I did not have those capabilities okay

2794.14 --> 2800.319
if somebody really threatened me with

2796.599 --> 2801.6600000000003
something big I was mortified from that

2800.319 --> 2805.24
like

2801.66 --> 2808.359
really scared with sweat on my head

2805.24 --> 2810.2799999999997
like please don't do please I don't mean

2808.359 --> 2815.16
anything I don't wanna please please

2810.28 --> 2815.1600000000003
don't ruin my life that sort of [ __ ]

2818.2 --> 2824.5789999999997
right but that's yeah

2821.38 --> 2824.579
turns out that

2825.579 --> 2830.8
I don't really have a it's probably also

2828.94 --> 2834.2200000000003
a combination of that I just don't have

2830.8 --> 2836.98
much of an integrated life

2834.22 --> 2841.5
to be ruined now

2836.98 --> 2841.5
maybe that's why just people stop

2841.54 --> 2846.46
threatening me because it's like oh he

2844.3 --> 2847.23
he doesn't actually have any leverage

2846.46 --> 2850.34
against him

2847.23 --> 2850.34
[Music]

2852.22 --> 2857.5
I don't know

2854.579 --> 2859.96
or maybe maybe those people that

2857.5 --> 2862.24
originally threatened me even in my own

2859.96 --> 2865.119
class maybe those are actually the

2862.24 --> 2868.14
pieces of [ __ ] that are now stalking me

2865.119 --> 2868.1400000000003
in chat it could be

2868.599 --> 2871.8
how ironic

2872.859 --> 2878.7999999999997
did you just end up

2875.319 --> 2881.8
stalking me on the internet

2878.8 --> 2884.829
20 years later or more

2881.8 --> 2884.829
[Music]

2889.66 --> 2894.0
whatever anyway what's that

2918.72 --> 2922.68
okay what is that

2940.619 --> 2947.319
very good keeps you sharp but it can

2944.2 --> 2949.68
take over your life why can I can attest

2947.319 --> 2949.68
to that

2953.76 --> 2959.26
and I was confronted with things when I

2957.22 --> 2960.839
was much younger

2959.26 --> 2964.3590000000004
that

2960.839 --> 2968.7999999999997
absolutely overtake took me overtook me

2964.359 --> 2970.66
in my life overtook me in my dreams

2968.8 --> 2973.1800000000003
some of the things that scared me

2970.66 --> 2976.839
actually became so scary to me I think

2973.18 --> 2979.2999999999997
that they attracted actual demons that

2976.839 --> 2981.52
would then like stalk me through the

2979.3 --> 2986.319
Dark World

2981.52 --> 2988.78
because of the fear I had

2986.319 --> 2991.359
right and some of these fears and I

2988.78 --> 2992.8590000000004
recognize this afterward came from Pure

2991.359 --> 2995.2599999999998
Bluffs

2992.859 --> 2998.859
from people that were just

2995.26 --> 3000.9
like really triggered Way Beyond normal

2998.859 --> 3004.5
levels and just

3000.9 --> 3007.2000000000003
try to psionically assault me basically

3004.5 --> 3010.859
and it worked

3007.2 --> 3013.7999999999997
and that scared me so badly that I

3010.859 --> 3015.96
basically just fizzled I was like I

3013.8 --> 3018.7200000000003
don't know what to do with this life

3015.96 --> 3023.16
there's such [ __ ] up things out there

3018.72 --> 3027.24
I I cannot compete with that

3023.16 --> 3030.96
I cannot be among that in between that

3027.24 --> 3033.1189999999997
and Thrive and and and do the things the

3030.96 --> 3035.579
way I work

3033.119 --> 3038.52
like I cannot be myself in this world

3035.579 --> 3041.099
that's what I got out of that

3038.52 --> 3044.3
for a long time

3041.099 --> 3044.3
it was very haunting

3058.38 --> 3064.26
there's a lot of beauty today yeah yeah

3062.099 --> 3068.1600000000003
should be anyway

3064.26 --> 3070.7400000000002
so I'll see the the G Plus link

3068.16 --> 3072.66
when I'll see it

3070.74 --> 3075.0
oh this time oh is there's a letter to

3072.66 --> 3076.98
me yes well I haven't seen Nathan show

3075.0 --> 3079.819
up yet so

3076.98 --> 3079.819
we'll see

3093.3 --> 3096.3
foreign

3109.619 --> 3112.1600000000003
right

3119.61 --> 3122.7090000000003
[Music]

3129.66 --> 3132.5
right

3132.51 --> 3137.76
[Music]

3150.859 --> 3156.66
okay kumu virus sure if you don't want

3154.14 --> 3159.5989999999997
to talk about it then don't I'm just

3156.66 --> 3162.98
trying to give you background as to

3159.599 --> 3162.98
where I'm coming from

3212.76 --> 3220.1400000000003
right but yeah this is just me trying to

3217.46 --> 3222.78
emphasize the journey

3220.14 --> 3225.359
of Flat Earth and how much things have

3222.78 --> 3228.38
actually changed for me

3225.359 --> 3228.38
in all that time

3243.18 --> 3247.5589999999997
yeah that's right Thor Casey that's a

3245.64 --> 3250.0989999999997
good point

3247.559 --> 3250.099
foreign

3252.359 --> 3257.2999999999997
lead

3253.859 --> 3257.2999999999997
for demonic influence

3259.4 --> 3267.1800000000003
right although Devils will also use it

3263.7 --> 3270.0789999999997
but the demons really rely on fear more

3267.18 --> 3270.0789999999997
than any

3272.819 --> 3279.44
right but mostly like

3276.18 --> 3282.54
what demons like so much is the idea of

3279.44 --> 3285.119
inapposable crushing defeat

3282.54 --> 3286.98
they want you to feel overwhelmed and

3285.119 --> 3288.54
then just through demoralization

3286.98 --> 3291.0
surrender

3288.54 --> 3294.0
Surrender Your will your soul however

3291.0 --> 3297.0
you see that it's an effect

3294.0 --> 3298.2
that's what the Demonic demons actually

3297.0 --> 3302.4
do

3298.2 --> 3305.48
ariman like this pure aromatic influence

3302.4 --> 3305.48
devils are different

3311.88 --> 3316.079
right because demons just destroy and

3314.4 --> 3319.52
there's nothing more destructive than

3316.079 --> 3319.52
just pure demoralization

3333.66 --> 3336.66
hmm

3347.359 --> 3353.22
right but if you want to actually start

3350.52 --> 3357.74
comparing spirits and [ __ ]

3353.22 --> 3357.74
this is gonna get very ethereal

3357.9 --> 3362.94
yeah I think there is a difference

3359.579 --> 3365.94
between demons and devils

3362.94 --> 3368.52
because a demon

3365.94 --> 3370.88
the only thing a demon has to offer is

3368.52 --> 3370.88
just

3371.28 --> 3376.2000000000003
escapism

3372.839 --> 3379.38
in its Rost form that's it

3376.2 --> 3382.0
Devils do actually have something to

3379.38 --> 3385.71
offer but they also punish you

3382.0 --> 3385.71
[Music]

3386.46 --> 3390.839
devils are much more like

3388.74 --> 3392.839
bartering

3390.839 --> 3396.48
in nature

3392.839 --> 3398.94
demons don't really care

3396.48 --> 3401.0
they're just there to

3398.94 --> 3401.0
the

3401.579 --> 3406.26
feed

3403.2 --> 3409.68
they just want whatever you got

3406.26 --> 3412.559
and they'll pull open a wound for more

3409.68 --> 3414.359
right that's it that's what demons do

3412.559 --> 3417.599
spirits

3414.359 --> 3421.2599999999998
Devils act yeah or you could say oh

3417.599 --> 3424.079
luciferia yeah what is luciferian arima

3421.26 --> 3426.5
Right ariman death the demoralizer the

3424.079 --> 3429.9
Destroyer the mechanizer

3426.5 --> 3436.4
robotizer slave for enslaver

3429.9 --> 3436.4
and Lucifer The Seducer The Arrogant one

3436.44 --> 3441.48
right

3438.059 --> 3445.6800000000003
but also deals

3441.48 --> 3447.72
like if you just do this one thing

3445.68 --> 3449.7599999999998
then you'll get all this

3447.72 --> 3452.54
and then of course there's more price to

3449.76 --> 3454.44
it that you're not informed about

3452.54 --> 3456.48
[Music]

3454.44 --> 3457.7400000000002
and if you yeah you should have seen

3456.48 --> 3459.2400000000002
that coming

3457.74 --> 3463.7
right

3459.24 --> 3463.7
that's going to be the bottle afterward

3464.52 --> 3471.78
Devil's s in Lucifer no not the Lucifer

3468.96 --> 3475.68
even the Lucifer that I just mentioned

3471.78 --> 3477.5400000000004
is not like the fallen angel devil blah

3475.68 --> 3479.64
blah blah no

3477.54 --> 3482.339
Lucifer is a spirit

3479.64 --> 3486.0589999999997
just like ariman arrowman the Destroyer

3482.339 --> 3487.5789999999997
death the demoralizer

3486.059 --> 3489.3190000000004
fear

3487.579 --> 3493.079
Lucifer

3489.319 --> 3495.119
is more like Apollo to the Seducer the

3493.079 --> 3497.28
the bringer of new things but always

3495.119 --> 3500.6400000000003
with the price

3497.28 --> 3503.4
right and in the

3500.64 --> 3507.0589999999997
Rudolph Steiner lore

3503.4 --> 3511.2000000000003
practically pragmatically Lucifer always

3507.059 --> 3513.3
will lead to ariman

3511.2 --> 3516.0589999999997
that always happens

3513.3 --> 3518.7200000000003
because of the nature of what they do

3516.059 --> 3518.7200000000003
with you

3519.24 --> 3523.74
right so yeah they start out with

3521.64 --> 3526.5
Lucifer oh we're so powerful oh we're

3523.74 --> 3529.319
we're the Little G's now oh we're the

3526.5 --> 3531.839
little Jesus we own you oh we're so

3529.319 --> 3533.2799999999997
badass right that's cool that's how it

3531.839 --> 3534.54
always starts out it's pretty awesome

3533.28 --> 3536.94
and then

3534.54 --> 3538.92
yeah [ __ ] starts happening and so we

3536.94 --> 3542.579
have to do things that a lot of people

3538.92 --> 3544.14
make hate you for and then more and then

3542.579 --> 3546.059
more and then you have to do even worse

3544.14 --> 3547.92
things and then suddenly your own family

3546.059 --> 3549.9
doesn't love you anymore

3547.92 --> 3553.319
and then suddenly

3549.9 --> 3556.319
you don't love you anymore and then

3553.319 --> 3560.099
it's all gone to [ __ ] and now you're

3556.319 --> 3562.2
with ariman Lucifer's burnt you out took

3560.099 --> 3564.839
all that fuel

3562.2 --> 3567.839
and now you're left with the uh with the

3564.839 --> 3572.4
ashes and ariman

3567.839 --> 3574.44
it's a formula it's a transition system

3572.4 --> 3578.579
right

3574.44 --> 3582.859
so you could compare Lucifer and Ironman

3578.579 --> 3582.8590000000004
with devils and demons

3596.7 --> 3602.04
but you see it right this is all super

3599.52 --> 3605.579
esoteric this is

3602.04 --> 3608.7799999999997
the effects themselves the effects of

3605.579 --> 3608.78
the spirits themselves

3611.54 --> 3615.23
[Music]

3618.49 --> 3623.0099999999998
[Music]

3625.56 --> 3632.5789999999997
[Music]

3630.359 --> 3634.859
right

3632.579 --> 3636.96
you can also

3634.859 --> 3638.22
there's distinct different qualities

3636.96 --> 3641.88
between

3638.22 --> 3645.1189999999997
devils and demons in how they respond

3641.88 --> 3649.7000000000003
demons are extremely envious

3645.119 --> 3649.7000000000003
they don't want you to have anything

3650.28 --> 3655.98
they just want you to be miserable and

3652.98 --> 3658.26
[ __ ] [ __ ] terrible hopeless so that they

3655.98 --> 3660.9
can feed off you that's like their their

3658.26 --> 3664.0400000000004
social stance

3660.9 --> 3665.96
Devils aren't like that

3664.04 --> 3671.16
devils

3665.96 --> 3673.02
want a business relation going

3671.16 --> 3676.2599999999998
they want to

3673.02 --> 3678.119
make sure that you can maintain that

3676.26 --> 3681.8390000000004
power

3678.119 --> 3685.02
so that they can interact with you

3681.839 --> 3687.24
see so they're not there to just it's

3685.02 --> 3689.4
like you can be paranoid to a devil and

3687.24 --> 3691.2599999999998
be like oh you're a demon and devil will

3689.4 --> 3693.9
be like no

3691.26 --> 3696.1800000000003
no I don't want to just destroy you

3693.9 --> 3701.099
I could have done that in the beginning

3696.18 --> 3704.64
if I really wanted to no I want to

3701.099 --> 3705.839
I want us to keep this thing going

3704.64 --> 3707.8799999999997
see

3705.839 --> 3709.98
that's the main difference that's how

3707.88 --> 3713.119
you recognize the difference of the

3709.98 --> 3713.119
spirit and their attitude

3719.059 --> 3726.2000000000003
a Crossroads demon what the [ __ ] are you

3722.88 --> 3726.2000000000003
talking about Akuma virus

3726.299 --> 3731.24
hello Scott good to see you yes there's

3728.46 --> 3731.2400000000002
fed today

3737.339 --> 3740.94
they're evil unfortunately higher

3739.2 --> 3744.48
manipulative and intelligent

3740.94 --> 3748.339
demons are not as intelligent

3744.48 --> 3748.339
they have no use for intelligence

3748.5 --> 3754.799
they just need to know what pulls the

3751.38 --> 3757.619
string they need they want to know how

3754.799 --> 3759.48
to alter things that's what the only

3757.619 --> 3761.579
thing demons care about right they want

3759.48 --> 3763.44
to break it they want to change it

3761.579 --> 3765.9
they just they don't care for

3763.44 --> 3767.359
intelligence they don't care for logic

3765.9 --> 3769.619
or anything

3767.359 --> 3772.14
Devils love it

3769.619 --> 3774.0
that was love intelligence

3772.14 --> 3777.0789999999997
that's

3774.0 --> 3777.079
how they do it

3777.42 --> 3782.52
right and by the way here comes the

3780.599 --> 3784.92
weird thing here comes the really really

3782.52 --> 3786.839
weird thing where it gets a bit fuzzy

3784.92 --> 3789.7400000000002
and uncertain as to what things really

3786.839 --> 3789.74
are and that is

3790.14 --> 3795.24
it's gonna be very hard for people to

3792.78 --> 3797.6600000000003
actually distinguish between a devil and

3795.24 --> 3797.66
an angel

3798.74 --> 3805.0789999999997
and arguably they might be

3803.16 --> 3807.48
kind of the same thing and the

3805.079 --> 3810.2000000000003
consequence of just manifesting in the

3807.48 --> 3810.2
Earthly Realm

3821.04 --> 3826.38
my experience

3822.72 --> 3831.2599999999998
the lawful nature of both angel and

3826.38 --> 3831.26
devil make them extremely alike

3832.94 --> 3839.64
although an angel will just not have any

3837.0 --> 3842.7
heavy heartedness within them

3839.64 --> 3846.49
they don't they can't they do not have

3842.7 --> 3848.64
that space within them to have that

3846.49 --> 3850.5
[Music]

3848.64 --> 3853.0789999999997
and that's really how you eventually

3850.5 --> 3855.96
know like okay this really isn't the

3853.079 --> 3859.02
devil because they don't have any

3855.96 --> 3861.119
capacity for evil they just can't

3859.02 --> 3863.16
not because they choose not to because

3861.119 --> 3866.4
they are not susceptible to that they

3863.16 --> 3868.3799999999997
just don't think like that

3866.4 --> 3870.78
right

3868.38 --> 3872.819
watching two more Troopers yeah you you

3870.78 --> 3875.3590000000004
have been yeah you probably didn't watch

3872.819 --> 3877.92
too much stupid Netflix

3875.359 --> 3879.72
brainwashing crap yeah

3877.92 --> 3881.88
I haven't

3879.72 --> 3883.859
I've not watched any of those days yeah

3881.88 --> 3888.119
everything I'm talking about is not

3883.859 --> 3892.5
based on my oh cool so this cool sci-fi

3888.119 --> 3895.02
[ __ ] and oh the Angels and Demons no no

3892.5 --> 3899.48
nothing I'm talking about is based on

3895.02 --> 3899.48
any of that on any movie

3899.579 --> 3906.2400000000002
it's all based on teachings of my healer

3903.18 --> 3907.74
in teachings of my dad through Rudolph

3906.24 --> 3908.9399999999996
Steiner by the way which is the original

3907.74 --> 3912.0589999999997
source

3908.94 --> 3914.76
and cross-referencing that with my

3912.059 --> 3917.94
personal spiritual studies

3914.76 --> 3922.38
that have performed for like a decade

3917.94 --> 3925.079
in the early 21st century

3922.38 --> 3929.339
right literally just

3925.079 --> 3933.299
yeah interacted with spirits and

3929.339 --> 3936.18
have exercised people from evil spirits

3933.299 --> 3938.839
and have exercised

3936.18 --> 3941.52
spirits and ghosts from haunted houses

3938.839 --> 3943.74
that sort of thing where I actually did

3941.52 --> 3946.2599999999998
that

3943.74 --> 3949.2
on top of also healing people including

3946.26 --> 3952.2000000000003
like really heavy ailments

3949.2 --> 3954.299
and a like haunted people for 20 years

3952.2 --> 3956.7599999999998
straight and then just taking it away

3954.299 --> 3960.18
like it was never there

3956.76 --> 3962.88
yeah I've done some stuff I've done

3960.18 --> 3965.8799999999997
serious study with Spirits interactions

3962.88 --> 3965.88
energy

3966.359 --> 3974.04
and that was all without even having a

3970.619 --> 3976.44
grasp on Rudolph Steiner on his work I

3974.04 --> 3979.319
hadn't even read that I went to the

3976.44 --> 3981.119
school I had heard about it and it just

3979.319 --> 3982.38
kind of forgot I kind of put it to the

3981.119 --> 3984.0
side

3982.38 --> 3985.859
well now

3984.0 --> 3988.5
I'm not putting that to the side anymore

3985.859 --> 3993.24
I've been reminded about it

3988.5 --> 3996.18
a lot and it's truly integrated with me

3993.24 --> 3999.18
now that I'm much older now that I'm

3996.18 --> 4001.52
actually susceptible to really get it

3999.18 --> 4003.5589999999997
and keep it instead of just getting it

4001.52 --> 4006.14
and then immediately taking it off

4003.559 --> 4008.559
because it's way too heavy for me at a

4006.14 --> 4008.5589999999997
young age

4011.24 --> 4014.24
foreign

4015.89 --> 4019.48
[Music]

4027.039 --> 4030.5200000000004
to what

4031.24 --> 4036.3799999999997
even into paranormal groups okay that's

4034.039 --> 4039.3190000000004
interesting I never really was with

4036.38 --> 4042.6800000000003
groups oh I was for a little bit

4039.319 --> 4045.319
the problem was is that in groups things

4042.68 --> 4047.359
would just start to happen

4045.319 --> 4051.4
to me

4047.359 --> 4051.4
and it was really unpredictable

4052.88 --> 4059.1800000000003
it's the same effect that also allows me

4056.059 --> 4064.4
to be the way I am on my show and to

4059.18 --> 4068.0
like do rage win and to be extremely

4064.4 --> 4071.02
just dominant

4068.0 --> 4071.02
by decision

4071.24 --> 4076.8799999999997
I have that it's a group effect it's

4074.359 --> 4079.7599999999998
like the group dynamic

4076.88 --> 4082.099
giving me that attention that enables me

4079.76 --> 4083.3590000000004
to do that because on my own I can't do

4082.099 --> 4086.839
any of this

4083.359 --> 4089.119
I'm very silent on my own

4086.839 --> 4091.88
but back then I didn't really have a lot

4089.119 --> 4093.319
of control over it so it was like whoa

4091.88 --> 4094.76
I'm getting all this energy from all

4093.319 --> 4097.219
this attention from people that think

4094.76 --> 4099.679
I'm really impressive like after I

4097.219 --> 4101.9
showed them I made this ring right for

4099.679 --> 4103.759
example they'd be like whoa

4101.9 --> 4107.12
and saw all this kind of spiritual stuff

4103.759 --> 4109.88
in it and then I'm like I got so put on

4107.12 --> 4112.4
a pedestal just in that one moment that

4109.88 --> 4115.759
I would literally just almost become

4112.4 --> 4119.839
completely megalomaniacal

4115.759 --> 4123.08
I did not have control over that effect

4119.839 --> 4126.94
I have now

4123.08 --> 4126.94
like 15 years later

4134.9 --> 4141.379999999999
but yeah I've always been very sensitive

4137.779 --> 4144.38
to energy Dynamics especially in groups

4141.38 --> 4147.52
it's like if people choose that I'm like

4144.38 --> 4147.52
the leader in the group

4148.699 --> 4151.48
that's

4151.94 --> 4158.9
like the energy is just really palpable

4155.9 --> 4160.94
to me of when that happens and when I

4158.9 --> 4163.5199999999995
was much younger I would just get

4160.94 --> 4166.639999999999
overwhelmed by it

4163.52 --> 4169.64
like the basically the power of that

4166.64 --> 4174.1990000000005
would corrupt me because it was just so

4169.64 --> 4175.96
I could feel it so much like whoa

4174.199 --> 4178.46
and I get

4175.96 --> 4181.64
influenced by the power that would tell

4178.46 --> 4185.0
me like you are now a ruler

4181.64 --> 4186.92
really bizarre how that works and by the

4185.0 --> 4188.839
way I've had that effect and that

4186.92 --> 4192.1990000000005
sensitivity

4188.839 --> 4194.84
since I was like fine

4192.199 --> 4198.0199999999995
I've always had that

4194.84 --> 4200.3
like it with me it also resulted in the

4198.02 --> 4202.34
effect that if for example my parents

4200.3 --> 4204.679
had friends over

4202.34 --> 4207.7390000000005
and they were like adults just chatting

4204.679 --> 4210.32
I would get in there and then everybody

4207.739 --> 4212.66
would be like oh

4210.32 --> 4215.84
and that would that moment of everybody

4212.66 --> 4216.94
or these adults that are very more high

4215.84 --> 4219.860000000001
functioning

4216.94 --> 4222.199
intellectually like more extensive more

4219.86 --> 4225.4
wise suddenly Focus all their energy on

4222.199 --> 4228.0199999999995
me that would be like boom

4225.4 --> 4231.379999999999
and then I would like suddenly like

4228.02 --> 4234.320000000001
start to try to act like an adult

4231.38 --> 4237.56
it's like whoa they're taking me they're

4234.32 --> 4239.42
all looking at me they're I can be more

4237.56 --> 4241.46
and then I would like try to have adult

4239.42 --> 4245.14
conversations and ask adult questions

4241.46 --> 4249.02
and that was like what it was

4245.14 --> 4251.6
five and six and seven but even like

4249.02 --> 4255.34
starting at five it's just that effect

4251.6 --> 4255.34
was always there with me

4256.4 --> 4263.259999999999
and now I basically associate that with

4259.46 --> 4263.26
just empathy sensitivity

4266.659 --> 4272.139999999999
lots of work and no orange what are you

4269.12 --> 4272.14
talking about Crockett

4281.78 --> 4284.32
actually

4284.63 --> 4287.749
[Music]

4296.6 --> 4302.56
you've been real busy with work yeah but

4299.0 --> 4302.56
what do you mean no our wind show

4316.179 --> 4320.679
do you mean when was it

4321.02 --> 4326.42
I mean I skipped the day

4323.36 --> 4329.5
when was that

4326.42 --> 4329.5
I think that was Monday

4330.56 --> 4333.6990000000005
is he talking about that

4333.98 --> 4338.0599999999995
oh

4335.6 --> 4341.5
oh you haven't been able to participate

4338.06 --> 4341.5
my show okay

4341.78 --> 4345.28
right because there has been an Arwen

4344.179 --> 4347.89
show

4345.28 --> 4350.969
so anyway

4347.89 --> 4350.969
[Music]

4352.58 --> 4356.44
yes I get that I get it

4362.78 --> 4369.0199999999995
right to six weeks oh damn well you

4366.32 --> 4373.12
missed a whole bunch I had a really good

4369.02 --> 4373.120000000001
set of shows in the last month

4373.34 --> 4378.58
foreign

4374.96 --> 4378.58
just look at the titles

4382.82 --> 4388.719
on average by the way I've just been

4384.8 --> 4388.719
able to figure out more titles

4389.06 --> 4395.0
which much further back was very hard

4392.54 --> 4397.34
for me to figure out good titles on a

4395.0 --> 4398.6
daily basis I'm figuring it out I'm

4397.34 --> 4402.860000000001
getting there

4398.6 --> 4405.320000000001
though now I made it so ethereal today

4402.86 --> 4407.9
I'm like oh my God what am I gonna call

4405.32 --> 4410.659
this show

4407.9 --> 4414.28
I might have to watch it back just to be

4410.659 --> 4414.28
able to figure out what to call it

4416.98 --> 4422.5
maybe the difference between devils and

4420.08 --> 4422.5
demons

4423.08 --> 4427.88
that's yeah that would at least make an

4425.719 --> 4430.36
interesting title

4427.88 --> 4430.36
right

4431.9 --> 4434.5
what do you guys think

4434.2 --> 4441.75
[Laughter]

4434.5 --> 4441.75
[Music]

4443.36 --> 4448.5199999999995
right it it's

4445.219 --> 4452.12
super distinct because hey out there

4448.52 --> 4454.219
in the religious communities people just

4452.12 --> 4456.32
think devils and demons are exactly the

4454.219 --> 4458.3
same thing like they don't see any

4456.32 --> 4460.159
difference and there's people arguing

4458.3 --> 4461.42
out there how there isn't any different

4460.159 --> 4463.699
so

4461.42 --> 4466.52
yeah to then just say the difference

4463.699 --> 4469.699
between devils and demons yeah that will

4466.52 --> 4473.02
definitely be like what

4469.699 --> 4473.0199999999995
they'll get your attention

4474.14 --> 4479.5
so yeah difference between devils and

4476.78 --> 4479.5
demons it is

4484.42 --> 4488.62
ah there's the G Plus link

4491.44 --> 4494.66
[Music]

4506.26 --> 4512.02
Spirits move glasses no no they don't

4510.08 --> 4514.4
not really

4512.02 --> 4516.320000000001
Morticia critical bag

4514.4 --> 4518.0599999999995
it's hilarious name

4516.32 --> 4520.5199999999995
but no

4518.06 --> 4524.179
no you see

4520.52 --> 4528.7390000000005
Spirits can't actually do anything

4524.179 --> 4531.7390000000005
what they can do however is tap into you

4528.739 --> 4533.48
the spirit of the person and then make

4531.739 --> 4537.259999999999
you do that

4533.48 --> 4537.259999999999
even involuntarily

4538.28 --> 4544.58
yeah demons and devils are not really

4541.82 --> 4546.739
involved with that although they might

4544.58 --> 4549.44
be they might be able I think devils and

4546.739 --> 4552.379999999999
demons might just like anything

4549.44 --> 4556.94
be externally

4552.38 --> 4556.9400000000005
like locked in trapped

4557.54 --> 4562.88
or made to do actions I don't know this

4560.42 --> 4564.62
is like going into like black magic [ __ ]

4562.88 --> 4566.36
and all that if you're gonna I don't go

4564.62 --> 4569.239
there I don't really care what I was

4566.36 --> 4571.219
talking about is about the psychological

4569.239 --> 4574.339999999999
nature of

4571.219 --> 4576.56
other entities that well might influence

4574.34 --> 4578.3
or possess you

4576.56 --> 4581.84
and how

4578.3 --> 4583.64
and then if somebody else is confronted

4581.84 --> 4586.34
with somebody in the state where they

4583.64 --> 4588.4400000000005
are being possessed they're like acting

4586.34 --> 4590.78
really crazy might be because of like

4588.44 --> 4593.299999999999
drugs for like

4590.78 --> 4595.46
I don't know getting off ssris or

4593.3 --> 4597.7390000000005
something that's gonna bring a demon out

4595.46 --> 4599.36
for sure I mean that's like the purest

4597.739 --> 4602.419999999999
form of demon possession that I've ever

4599.36 --> 4604.88
heard of like what can happen with that

4602.42 --> 4607.64
right but

4604.88 --> 4609.14
there is a difference in what can

4607.64 --> 4612.679
possess people

4609.14 --> 4614.84
even like within your own life like when

4612.679 --> 4617.659
you feel bad and then you might have a

4614.84 --> 4620.6
change some things things aspects about

4617.659 --> 4623.199
you relations that you have with

4620.6 --> 4623.1990000000005
entities

4623.48 --> 4629.78
or that they haunt you

4626.48 --> 4632.139999999999
whatever but I just thought it was

4629.78 --> 4636.139999999999
important to this yeah dude

4632.14 --> 4638.6
differentiate between the types of

4636.14 --> 4642.320000000001
spirits and like how do you recognize

4638.6 --> 4644.96
them and what right I mean you can

4642.32 --> 4647.42
recognize one of these entities in

4644.96 --> 4649.64
another person and just say like wow

4647.42 --> 4653.719
it really seems like that person has

4649.64 --> 4655.34
like a little devil in them or something

4653.719 --> 4658.1
and

4655.34 --> 4660.52
that has a very different social Dynamic

4658.1 --> 4663.76
from another person that might be

4660.52 --> 4667.6990000000005
stalked by a demon which will probably

4663.76 --> 4670.280000000001
typically come out like in depression

4667.699 --> 4671.96
right very directly associated with

4670.28 --> 4673.5199999999995
demons a lot of the time that's when

4671.96 --> 4674.44
they typically come out that's what they

4673.52 --> 4677.6
feed them

4674.44 --> 4679.98
demoralization Etc right so how do you

4677.6 --> 4686.84
recognize the different traits

4679.98 --> 4686.839999999999
[Music]

4693.5 --> 4697.9
are ghosts Ghosts no

4698.6 --> 4704.0
the ghost is just an apparition

4701.9 --> 4708.879999999999
it's not an entity

4704.0 --> 4708.88
Spirits Spirits are not ghosts

4710.179 --> 4717.62
right Spirits which would is like

4714.739 --> 4720.379999999999
Spirits are non-material

4717.62 --> 4722.78
it's really that simple

4720.38 --> 4724.219
ghost is like an echo that you might

4722.78 --> 4727.219
pick up it's like a information

4724.219 --> 4730.699
recording left by a living being

4727.219 --> 4733.76
an event of energy release

4730.699 --> 4737.54
the spirits are not Material

4733.76 --> 4738.7390000000005
they we can only be perceived through a

4737.54 --> 4743.42
mind

4738.739 --> 4745.879999999999
and Consciousness they're not anywhere

4743.42 --> 4749.0
but through the other dimension where a

4745.88 --> 4750.7390000000005
spirit also is part of taking part in

4749.0 --> 4755.179
they can

4750.739 --> 4758.12
contact through you so people can have

4755.179 --> 4760.58
direct relationships with Spirits

4758.12 --> 4763.099999999999
including dark ones

4760.58 --> 4765.199
and there will be nobody

4763.1 --> 4767.54
that would ever perceive anything

4765.199 --> 4772.28
physical about that

4767.54 --> 4774.38
but you can recognize character traits

4772.28 --> 4777.4
and that's really what I what I wanted

4774.38 --> 4777.400000000001
to emphasize today

4777.83 --> 4781.01
[Music]

4787.34 --> 4790.56
I'm missing that yeah schizophrenia yeah

4789.32 --> 4793.849
of course

4790.56 --> 4793.849
[Music]

4796.88 --> 4801.14
all right like to bring out the video

4799.64 --> 4802.820000000001
again

4801.14 --> 4805.1
somebody else linked it you looked that

4802.82 --> 4807.679
up it was a really good video let's see

4805.1 --> 4811.0
I think I still have it in

4807.679 --> 4811.0
or any bird check

4816.92 --> 4819.46
that's it

4821.179 --> 4827.659
did I forget ah damn it

4825.02 --> 4830.120000000001
the doctor interview

4827.659 --> 4832.82
is a really good one

4830.12 --> 4836.26
I posted that like a

4832.82 --> 4836.259999999999
two weeks ago or something

4837.86 --> 4842.78
is that doctor that studied like

4839.98 --> 4844.339999999999
schizophrenia patients and was basically

4842.78 --> 4847.34
explaining

4844.34 --> 4849.56
that those are like other entities right

4847.34 --> 4851.06
well that's completely compatible with

4849.56 --> 4854.860000000001
my system

4851.06 --> 4854.860000000001
what I'm talking about right here

4862.34 --> 4867.9400000000005
a ghost typically right now but a ghost

4864.92 --> 4867.9400000000005
isn't even an entity

4869.84 --> 4875.719
ghost is like a tape recording

4872.42 --> 4878.54
it's like a tape recording of the spirit

4875.719 --> 4882.56
and it can get triggered

4878.54 --> 4886.34
like somebody clicking the play button

4882.56 --> 4888.679
and then the person will experience and

4886.34 --> 4891.679
then potentially there might even be

4888.679 --> 4895.78
like well telekinetic effects triggered

4891.679 --> 4895.78
but that will be through the people

4897.32 --> 4905.48
because entities cannot do any kind of

4901.699 --> 4909.379999999999
Paranormal Activity without

4905.48 --> 4912.28
actually using a person their dorm and

4909.38 --> 4912.28
energy to do it

4914.96 --> 4918.9800000000005
right where are they getting the energy

4916.52 --> 4921.1990000000005
from they can only take it from

4918.98 --> 4923.599999999999
something that has energy because a

4921.199 --> 4926.419999999999
spirit doesn't have a body

4923.6 --> 4929.120000000001
it can't do anything without a living

4926.42 --> 4930.9800000000005
body with energy right and ghost is a

4929.12 --> 4932.42
residual energy so it's just the tape

4930.98 --> 4934.58
recording

4932.42 --> 4937.82
it's not even an entity it's like an

4934.58 --> 4939.0199999999995
echo or recording of an entity or an

4937.82 --> 4941.48
event

4939.02 --> 4944.56
and a person that's especially sensitive

4941.48 --> 4947.299999999999
can literally have that

4944.56 --> 4951.159000000001
imprinted on them as if they had a

4947.3 --> 4951.159000000001
telepathic connection with the person

4951.26 --> 4956.0
that might not even be there anymore

4952.88 --> 4957.8
right that's what a real ghost typically

4956.0 --> 4960.56
is

4957.8 --> 4963.62
pick up a ghost you pick up residual

4960.56 --> 4966.76
energy tape recording of another of a

4963.62 --> 4966.76
living person

4968.36 --> 4973.759999999999
and usually involving their death too

4971.179 --> 4977.2390000000005
because that does typically do like

4973.76 --> 4980.4400000000005
create this massive energy build up

4977.239 --> 4980.44
that enables that

4981.25 --> 4987.829
[Music]

4988.699 --> 4993.379999999999
like I said link yeah it was a great

4990.5 --> 4995.78
video right amazing I mean it was a

4993.38 --> 4998.84
compilation of these types of the Sun

4995.78 --> 5000.34
video in between the clouds and in the

4998.84 --> 5002.62
middle of the ocean that's like a

5000.34 --> 5004.659000000001
compilation of the last seven years I

5002.62 --> 5006.88
mean there's a lot of people that have

5004.659 --> 5009.46
filmed the Horizon and the sun in the

5006.88 --> 5012.159000000001
last seven years and so you get all

5009.46 --> 5014.679
these amazing sightings it's like a

5012.159 --> 5017.08
collection video of over the years but

5014.679 --> 5019.679
pretty impressive right

5017.08 --> 5019.679
anyway

5026.02 --> 5030.540000000001
what what are you talking about clearly

5030.82 --> 5035.46
no

5032.56 --> 5035.46
no it's not

5042.46 --> 5047.699
that makes no sense everything cannot be

5044.739 --> 5047.699
happening at once

5054.88 --> 5059.62
right

5057.1 --> 5062.1990000000005
oh yeah yeah how did the operation go

5059.62 --> 5063.76
but I almost forgot Robert yeah you just

5062.199 --> 5067.678999999999

5063.76 --> 5071.76
