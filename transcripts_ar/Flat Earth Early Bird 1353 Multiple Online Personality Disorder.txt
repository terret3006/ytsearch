[Music]

55.079 --> 59.92
good morning welcome to flat earth early

58.559 --> 62.0
bird number

59.92 --> 64.4
1353

62.0 --> 66.56
i'm your host irwin and before we start

64.4 --> 69.28
the show please don't forget to share it

66.56 --> 71.52
on any platform you deem fit and if you

69.28 --> 73.76
haven't already subscribe to my channel

71.52 --> 76.15899999999999
hit the bell notification so you know

73.76 --> 78.479
when i'm going live which is normally 1

76.159 --> 80.64
pm amsterdam time and weekdays and 2 pm

78.479 --> 83.119
amsterdam time in the weekend and please

80.64 --> 85.119
also do support me through the paypal

83.119 --> 87.04
patreon super chat and a membership

85.119 --> 89.52
system join button that would be much

87.04 --> 93.60000000000001
appreciated

89.52 --> 93.6
and yeah i could sure use it

94.56 --> 96.88
because

97.119 --> 101.28
well you know why

99.04 --> 102.96000000000001
please keep the support coming was great

101.28 --> 105.43900000000001
getting that uh

102.96 --> 108.32
paypal from dank yesterday

105.439 --> 108.32
but yeah

108.64 --> 111.759
anyway the weather

112.159 --> 115.84
is

112.96 --> 115.83999999999999
beautiful

116.56 --> 120.96000000000001
it's weird there were actually trails

118.88 --> 123.6
going on earlier but it seems to have

120.96 --> 125.67999999999999
all dissipated because well i suspect

123.6 --> 127.52
it's because there is like a pretty

125.68 --> 129.20000000000002
constant wind

127.52 --> 130.879
out there

129.2 --> 133.67999999999998
which is really refreshing because

130.879 --> 136.319
without that it would be

133.68 --> 136.31900000000002
very warm

138.72 --> 143.64
it's really beautiful weather

155.44 --> 159.84
[Music]

157.36 --> 160.8
hello pjcnet first in chat

159.84 --> 163.519
thank

160.8 --> 169.36
elis g good to see you all

163.519 --> 171.84
it is saturday the 3rd of september 2022

169.36 --> 171.84
huh

174.64 --> 177.92
and i feel pretty good

178.959 --> 184.8
and it really uh it yeah

181.36 --> 189.20000000000002
impromptu uh

184.8 --> 189.20000000000002
performance on gymbops yesterday

190.08 --> 193.36
i noticed that slo-mo moonbuggy was

191.92 --> 194.95899999999997
there in chat i don't know who else

193.36 --> 196.64000000000001
picked up on that

194.959 --> 200.72
but yeah i'm very proud of it i just

196.64 --> 200.72
watched it back it was great

201.68 --> 206.15900000000002
so i'm just going to give you a link

204.08 --> 208.72
to where i popped in

206.159 --> 211.35999999999999
you could also just watch the previous

208.72 --> 213.92
hour which i think is like reviewing of

211.36 --> 215.84
sean hawking comments or something

213.92 --> 216.72
it's what jim bob typically starts out

215.84 --> 219.12
with

216.72 --> 221.519
but yeah i'm really proud of what i put

219.12 --> 224.4
down there and

221.519 --> 226.31900000000002
it was really nice

224.4 --> 228.799
being on gymlop's panel can be just

226.319 --> 231.35999999999999
really really nice

228.799 --> 233.59900000000002
and it was this time

231.36 --> 233.59900000000002
so

234.799 --> 242.72
yeah feel pretty good also wow dude

239.76 --> 245.599
inner food man

242.72 --> 248.159
like that did a lot of good and i've

245.599 --> 250.959
actually decided before i started the

248.159 --> 250.959
show to take

251.36 --> 258.23900000000003
some of that again

254.4 --> 260.56
and i'm kind of enjoying it so

258.239 --> 262.23999999999995
these might be the greens i was looking

260.56 --> 265.28000000000003
for

262.24 --> 266.84000000000003
it's so funny remember i had a show

265.28 --> 270.55999999999995
that i

266.84 --> 270.56
afterwards titled

273.12 --> 278.8
oh yeah this is yesterday actually late

275.04 --> 281.44
yesterday yeah eat your vegetables

278.8 --> 283.36
and then in the end i ended up well

281.44 --> 285.84
effectively eating this stuff it's

283.36 --> 288.0
freeze-dried but i think i really needed

285.84 --> 288.0
it

288.88 --> 292.56
i've just sean's voices nails on

291.12 --> 295.759
chalkboard

292.56 --> 299.44
well he's he's not with us on the

295.759 --> 299.44
live show panel there think

299.68 --> 304.639
no it's just jim bob's reviewing his

302.479 --> 306.88
comments and [ __ ]

304.639 --> 309.039
sean hawkins is after him he yeah he

306.88 --> 311.12
opened his membership system

309.039 --> 313.44
it's like new names and one of them is

311.12 --> 317.6
like the base membership is called the

313.44 --> 317.6
polaris challenge and it was just like

319.12 --> 324.08
yeah

320.24 --> 326.0
he sold them like hotcakes

324.08 --> 328.32
or yeah

326.0 --> 330.479
it was hilarious

328.32 --> 334.4
but uh

330.479 --> 334.4
yeah that's like the first half anyway

337.12 --> 340.96
yesterday's flat earth debate was also

338.96 --> 343.75899999999996
pretty good another continuation of the

340.96 --> 343.75899999999996
ether wars

344.96 --> 347.19899999999996
uh

347.36 --> 353.039
i had a really intense after show

350.96 --> 357.19899999999996
uh yeah for a bit

353.039 --> 357.199
so we were just like really digging into

357.28 --> 361.52
quantum mechanics related things and

359.52 --> 363.84
like

361.52 --> 366.24
kiwi got in and there was a question and

363.84 --> 368.63899999999995
then i kind of just like got straight

366.24 --> 371.44
forward and everybody got angry with me

368.639 --> 371.44
so i just left

372.479 --> 375.52
what had to do with the

375.759 --> 378.759
copenhagen

378.84 --> 384.479
method of interpretation

381.84 --> 387.75899999999996
and then kiwi laid down what i thought

384.479 --> 390.08
it was and then i just asked

387.759 --> 392.56
do you stand behind that and he got

390.08 --> 396.15999999999997
really pissed off

392.56 --> 397.919
it was weird it's very very qe but

396.16 --> 399.759
yeah we'll see

397.919 --> 402.0
it's interesting because i would really

399.759 --> 403.759
like to dig into more

402.0 --> 406.08
quantum mechanics and hey that is his

403.759 --> 409.8
field so i think he's just kind of

406.08 --> 409.8
nervous about it

410.08 --> 415.039
because it's really cool to have like a

412.8 --> 416.72
virtual monopoly because you're studied

415.039 --> 418.31899999999996
in it and you know so much more than

416.72 --> 420.639
everybody and then they're just gonna be

418.319 --> 422.639
like okay with whatever you say

420.639 --> 425.919
but if you're going to inquire now

422.639 --> 428.88
suddenly the integrity of his knowledge

425.919 --> 428.88
is being tested

429.28 --> 435.08
and kiwi has a tendency to not like that

438.88 --> 441.36
we'll see

445.28 --> 451.75899999999996
anyway uh

448.16 --> 454.56
waited in another stream yeah

451.759 --> 458.16
yeah i think witsit is just like

454.56 --> 458.16
going completely overboard

460.4 --> 465.84
we don't presuppose the medium there's

462.319 --> 465.84000000000003
nothing to investigate

482.479 --> 485.479
okay

499.84 --> 503.35999999999996
so yeah guys

501.199 --> 505.52000000000004
yeah i had just a funny little title in

503.36 --> 509.12
reference to trolls mostly

505.52 --> 510.79999999999995
multiple online personality disorder

509.12 --> 513.36
didn't really have like

510.8 --> 515.76
a whole theme for that

513.36 --> 517.6800000000001
i mean i don't really want to dig into

515.76 --> 519.36
that i don't want to unnecessarily draw

517.68 --> 522.7189999999999
them in but if they're going to get in

519.36 --> 524.88
then i'm sure i'm gonna apply it

522.719 --> 526.24
let's hope we can just have a nice

524.88 --> 529.279
peaceful

526.24 --> 529.279
saturday stream

531.519 --> 536.16
a terrible 306

533.76 --> 536.16
see you

537.36 --> 540.9590000000001
yeah what is the temperature here

541.839 --> 547.2
27 degrees celsius right

544.48 --> 550.64
that makes sense

547.2 --> 550.6400000000001
the wind is really helping a

560.839 --> 568.6400000000001
lot are you in chat last night fpd5 no

565.92 --> 568.64
now tear it

571.36 --> 576.64
or a bit but probably not the same time

574.32 --> 580.32
that you were watching

576.64 --> 580.3199999999999
i think i caught a bit of the end of it

585.2 --> 590.9590000000001
this is bombarding

588.399 --> 593.92
you mean spamming

590.959 --> 596.16
hey akumavirus

593.92 --> 598.3199999999999
hey slow mo moon buggy

596.16 --> 600.7199999999999
to see you

598.32 --> 605.279
yeah by the way i do have an

600.72 --> 607.6
illuminati croissant here but

605.279 --> 607.6
yeah

607.92 --> 610.399
we'll see

611.04 --> 616.519
i'm getting kind of hungry actually so i

612.88 --> 616.519
might just eat it

621.12 --> 627.88
used to seeing me in a day lighting

623.44 --> 627.8800000000001
looks different in the night yeah i know

644.48 --> 649.76
look for a website chat youtube not app

649.839 --> 652.1600000000001
okay

655.44 --> 659.24
i guess there it

663.36 --> 669.12
but i also think that they're supposedly

665.519 --> 672.5600000000001
like these special type of smiley set

669.12 --> 674.399
even for like windows 10 and all that

672.56 --> 676.16
but i don't think anybody really cares

674.399 --> 677.2
about those smileys because i've never

676.16 --> 680.4399999999999
seen

677.2 --> 680.44
seen that

690.079 --> 693.079
really

704.399 --> 707.399
no

718.24 --> 722.24
oh the hidden face one is that peekaboo

720.959 --> 725.5189999999999
really

722.24 --> 726.9590000000001
that's face in clouds

725.519 --> 728.0
seeing star wars

726.959 --> 731.8389999999999
anyway

728.0 --> 731.839
yeah it's not registering so

739.2 --> 744.6
it doesn't get a print yeah well not for

741.44 --> 744.6
me either

745.2 --> 751.36
i mean i'm just i just type the letters

747.44 --> 751.36
and i just see the letters so

751.839 --> 758.12
what is that

754.32 --> 758.12
i've never seen that

768.16 --> 771.36
i've never seen that one

770.399 --> 774.639
that

771.36 --> 777.839
does not typically show up

774.639 --> 777.839
in the smiley list

779.6 --> 785.2
sure what so whatever i mean is this

781.92 --> 785.1999999999999
really super interesting

793.04 --> 797.279
all right so for some reason i am seeing

795.2 --> 801.519
that smiley but you see

797.279 --> 804.88
i don't really care this is

801.519 --> 804.88
it's a stupid smiley

807.04 --> 811.0
but yeah sure whatever

818.959 --> 821.3599999999999
hello

826.839 --> 830.48
liam it was

830.959 --> 836.3199999999999
probably a sock troll

833.76 --> 836.3199999999999
i'll see

839.76 --> 843.8389999999999
a psych bear good to see you

844.639 --> 850.76
all right i'm just gonna dig into this

847.04 --> 850.76
illuminati croissant

857.279 --> 860.279
hmm

881.04 --> 884.04
hmm

886.8 --> 889.68
hey that's weird

890.079 --> 895.519
seems like the uh

892.32 --> 898.0790000000001
the noise cancellation system

895.519 --> 898.9590000000001
on my mic is not working as usual is my

898.079 --> 900.16
sound

898.959 --> 901.8389999999999
different

900.16 --> 905.04
since yesterday because i did have to

901.839 --> 905.0400000000001
reinstall obs

907.279 --> 912.04
or are you guys not picking up any

909.04 --> 912.04
chains

919.04 --> 925.48
okay i'm gonna

921.199 --> 925.4799999999999
have to do something about that

926.24 --> 928.5600000000001
hmm

933.92 --> 938.12
how did you do that again

941.12 --> 945.68
oh yeah filters

943.36 --> 949.88
noise suppression

945.68 --> 949.88
okay there is a noise suppression

956.639 --> 959.36
this is really

966.839 --> 971.399
odd noise gate

991.199 --> 995.16
i'm gonna try that out

998.959 --> 1002.079
right so

1000.56 --> 1004.4799999999999
this

1002.079 --> 1004.4799999999999
header

1005.68 --> 1010.16
ah

1007.199 --> 1012.399
wow

1010.16 --> 1012.399
uh

1014.72 --> 1020.6800000000001
see it doesn't register if we don't talk

1016.639 --> 1020.6800000000001
loud enough now this sucks

1038.72 --> 1041.72
what

1066.64 --> 1071.2
right okay for the time being i'm just

1068.64 --> 1075.16
gonna keep it like this

1071.2 --> 1075.16
this is annoying though

1083.52 --> 1088.96
hey steamy traveler susie s

1086.08 --> 1088.96
good to see you both

1090.88 --> 1095.2
yeah i'm a little sweaty it's very hot

1093.12 --> 1096.0
in here

1095.2 --> 1098.64
ugh

1096.0 --> 1102.24
i have no idea why i made green tea for

1098.64 --> 1104.5590000000002
myself when it's way too hot for that

1102.24 --> 1107.559
we'll see maybe when it cools down a bit

1104.559 --> 1107.559
more

1117.84 --> 1121.48
hey davey z

1130.88 --> 1133.88
hmm

1141.12 --> 1143.6789999999999
wait what

1146.08 --> 1153.0
37 degree

1148.08 --> 1153.0
iced tea that doesn't sound very icy

1174.799 --> 1177.799
hmm

1193.36 --> 1195.6789999999999
um

1205.039 --> 1208.679
oh okay abc

1230.24 --> 1235.44
yes akumavarus don't worry i will

1233.679 --> 1236.88
no i don't want to talk about freaking

1235.44 --> 1239.44
rap thanks

1236.88 --> 1239.44
but uh

1239.84 --> 1244.3999999999999
yeah anything

1241.36 --> 1246.32
else i mean inquire i'm here i'm pretty

1244.4 --> 1249.679
much

1246.32 --> 1252.48
i got energy i'm focused i

1249.679 --> 1255.039
still getting used to

1252.48 --> 1257.2
also yeah i did have

1255.039 --> 1258.4
get it i did get a text message from my

1257.2 --> 1260.799
healer

1258.4 --> 1265.6000000000001
still there he was just on vacation so

1260.799 --> 1265.6
that's why i'd be able to contact him

1265.919 --> 1270.48
but he did text heal me apparently and

1268.32 --> 1272.799
that was yeah

1270.48 --> 1274.24
it's always good

1272.799 --> 1276.4
although it's much weirder that way i

1274.24 --> 1279.76
mean if it if i actually hear his voice

1276.4 --> 1279.76
it tends to work a lot better

1283.76 --> 1287.679
also because we can then cross connect

1286.32 --> 1290.08
on things

1287.679 --> 1291.8400000000001
like about what's going on the energies

1290.08 --> 1294.0
that are influencing

1291.84 --> 1296.1589999999999
because i don't just use him for like oh

1294.0 --> 1297.36
could you please do a remote lay on

1296.159 --> 1299.7600000000002
hands

1297.36 --> 1301.36
no i actually i want to know about like

1299.76 --> 1303.6
what's out there

1301.36 --> 1305.36
what about the other people

1303.6 --> 1308.08
that you help like what is bothering

1305.36 --> 1308.08
everybody and

1309.76 --> 1312.64
to figure it out

1311.28 --> 1315.52
right

1312.64 --> 1318.48
and i help him too

1315.52 --> 1322.48
i help my healer makes sense of it

1318.48 --> 1322.48
because he's mostly just doing things

1322.64 --> 1326.3200000000002
it's just for me it's a standard habit

1324.48 --> 1327.1200000000001
to just

1326.32 --> 1329.76
help

1327.12 --> 1333.559
with constructive oversight i can't help

1329.76 --> 1333.559
i do it with everything

1333.679 --> 1337.6000000000001
so

1334.96 --> 1337.6000000000001
but anyway

1338.159 --> 1343.5200000000002
would you consider balwin or rachman an

1340.64 --> 1347.24
alternate personality

1343.52 --> 1347.24
well that's very tricky

1351.44 --> 1355.76
they are other sides

1354.0 --> 1357.2
of me

1355.76 --> 1358.4
they are me

1357.2 --> 1360.64
they're just

1358.4 --> 1363.44
in a different setting it's just a

1360.64 --> 1363.44
different setting

1364.799 --> 1369.28
right

1365.84 --> 1372.6399999999999
i'm not literally compartmentalized

1369.28 --> 1375.6399999999999
it's just a different setting

1372.64 --> 1375.64
acts

1377.2 --> 1381.1200000000001
well

1378.4 --> 1383.52
what is acting

1381.12 --> 1385.9189999999999
you act in a certain way like what is

1383.52 --> 1389.52
guiding your act

1385.919 --> 1391.2
what principles are you

1389.52 --> 1392.559
applying and then what are you

1391.2 --> 1394.24
unleashing what energies are you

1392.559 --> 1398.6789999999999
wielding

1394.24 --> 1398.679
so to me it's just different settings

1407.52 --> 1412.559
right

1408.559 --> 1412.559
but they all serve a function

1412.88 --> 1415.7600000000002
right they have

1414.24 --> 1419.36
like

1415.76 --> 1419.36
sub objectives they have

1423.6 --> 1430.0
they basically have their own principles

1426.799 --> 1431.44
sub principles not actually my main

1430.0 --> 1435.279
principles

1431.44 --> 1437.8400000000001
but derived or like in response of my

1435.279 --> 1440.559
main principles

1437.84 --> 1443.039
literally and so in a way they are like

1440.559 --> 1445.52
my philosophical opposition they like

1443.039 --> 1447.2
they are well devils in the cage

1445.52 --> 1450.0
contained

1447.2 --> 1453.76
contra contain controlled

1450.0 --> 1453.76
personal internal opposition

1455.12 --> 1458.2399999999998
they

1456.08 --> 1460.559
allow me to

1458.24 --> 1463.84
do certain things that just my main

1460.559 --> 1463.84
setting would not allow

1464.88 --> 1469.0800000000002
dude davey z what the [ __ ]

1480.96 --> 1487.08
okay i don't see what depression has to

1483.36 --> 1487.08
do with any of this

1494.64 --> 1500.919
everybody goes through depression

1497.919 --> 1500.919
no

1501.44 --> 1504.799
no you don't

1504.0 --> 1507.44
but

1504.799 --> 1510.08
if you don't

1507.44 --> 1512.799
take care enough

1510.08 --> 1515.1999999999998
of the energies and swings if you don't

1512.799 --> 1516.72
actually take responsibility for the

1515.2 --> 1519.76
dynamic

1516.72 --> 1521.2
of yourself as a living being

1519.76 --> 1524.1589999999999
then

1521.2 --> 1526.24
you might end up postponing

1524.159 --> 1528.4
dealing with things

1526.24 --> 1531.2
getting into driven into a corner and

1528.4 --> 1534.0800000000002
then you break

1531.2 --> 1534.0800000000002
that's depression

1535.919 --> 1539.44
you lose it

1537.36 --> 1542.4399999999998
that's not that does not happen to

1539.44 --> 1542.44
everybody

1543.52 --> 1548.32
but it can happen when you do that

1548.64 --> 1552.96
depression doesn't like ever just out of

1551.279 --> 1554.84
nowhere pop up

1552.96 --> 1558.88
although there are some

1554.84 --> 1558.8799999999999
chronically depressed people

1560.48 --> 1563.279
right

1561.44 --> 1565.6000000000001
but that's different

1563.279 --> 1568.96
those are people that are like it seems

1565.6 --> 1568.9599999999998
to be their predominant

1569.2 --> 1572.4
conscious state and

1572.64 --> 1577.679
it's like almost impossible to get those

1575.44 --> 1580.4
people out

1577.679 --> 1582.4
because if you confront it truly you

1580.4 --> 1584.4
basically get faced with the demon and

1582.4 --> 1586.799
it's very dangerous including for that

1584.4 --> 1587.919
person

1586.799 --> 1590.72
because

1587.919 --> 1593.8400000000001
i think that true depression is actually

1590.72 --> 1597.44
secretly an addiction

1593.84 --> 1599.76
that you just cannot snap out of

1597.44 --> 1603.8400000000001
and if somebody tries to force that then

1599.76 --> 1606.1589999999999
you'll literally just martyr yourself

1603.84 --> 1609.36
that's actually the state of depression

1606.159 --> 1609.3600000000001
and i've been there too

1609.84 --> 1613.6
in my teens i've experienced those types

1611.76 --> 1615.6
of things faced a lot of things that i

1613.6 --> 1618.8799999999999
could deal with

1615.6 --> 1618.8799999999999
and that would make me snap

1619.679 --> 1624.8400000000001
right

1621.44 --> 1624.8400000000001
oh the goods

1636.08 --> 1640.8799999999999
ha will wheaton said i'm going to do

1638.64 --> 1643.2
movies in costume because i'm an adult

1640.88 --> 1645.279
and i get to decide what that means

1643.2 --> 1649.1200000000001
that is hilarious

1645.279 --> 1652.64
and in a nerdy way kind of cool

1649.12 --> 1654.2399999999998
i mean if he can actually own it right

1652.64 --> 1656.3990000000001
if he's going to be a com yeah this is

1654.24 --> 1658.96
the problem like people that are like oh

1656.399 --> 1660.1589999999999
i want to do larp why are you making fun

1658.96 --> 1662.3990000000001
of me

1660.159 --> 1664.96
yeah no [ __ ] dude why do you think

1662.399 --> 1667.12
because you're a weenie

1664.96 --> 1669.44
and you don't own it right if you're

1667.12 --> 1671.36
gonna walk around in a costume you gotta

1669.44 --> 1673.8400000000001
actually own it

1671.36 --> 1675.12
otherwise you're just a pretender weenie

1673.84 --> 1676.72
boy

1675.12 --> 1679.4399999999998
that of course everybody's gonna point

1676.72 --> 1680.559
at you make fun of you unless you really

1679.44 --> 1683.44
own it

1680.559 --> 1685.76
you're you're actually the act

1683.44 --> 1687.679
you're taking the larp serious and then

1685.76 --> 1689.2
people might still point at you but that

1687.679 --> 1690.96
shouldn't then matter

1689.2 --> 1693.2
because you're too much in character to

1690.96 --> 1693.2
care

1693.36 --> 1697.9189999999999
i've done that

1694.84 --> 1697.9189999999999
[ __ ] this is

1698.799 --> 1703.679
literally well two places where you

1701.12 --> 1705.84
would expect that not in a movie

1703.679 --> 1708.48
although i think i did yeah

1705.84 --> 1709.76
to be fair i did go to the matrix movies

1708.48 --> 1711.919
like that

1709.76 --> 1714.72
but that's because that was just my

1711.919 --> 1717.919
standard attire

1714.72 --> 1717.919
without the sunglasses

1718.72 --> 1722.76
and my camera just froze

1735.36 --> 1739.6789999999999
what about this online multiple

1737.6 --> 1742.0
personality thing yeah it has nothing to

1739.679 --> 1745.279
do with any of that yeah if you're gonna

1742.0 --> 1746.799
larp and you're gonna put on a costume

1745.279 --> 1748.559
that doesn't mean you have multiple

1746.799 --> 1751.12
personality disorder that means you're

1748.559 --> 1754.1589999999999
engaged in an act

1751.12 --> 1757.1999999999998
which can be for fun

1754.159 --> 1757.2
or for trickery

1757.44 --> 1761.8400000000001
it all depends

1759.76 --> 1764.8799999999999
right

1761.84 --> 1767.4399999999998
multiple online personality disorder is

1764.88 --> 1768.48
about people

1767.44 --> 1771.279
that

1768.48 --> 1773.3600000000001
are so used to anonymity on the internet

1771.279 --> 1775.679
that they will end up making stock

1773.36 --> 1777.9189999999999
accounts and just force themselves onto

1775.679 --> 1780.24
everybody and feeling really powerful

1777.919 --> 1783.679
because of that

1780.24 --> 1784.88
but when you do that you completely lose

1783.679 --> 1788.96
yourself

1784.88 --> 1791.8400000000001
your actual original self

1788.96 --> 1794.96
you will lose your sense of that because

1791.84 --> 1797.6
you're going about completely unanchored

1794.96 --> 1797.6000000000001
anonymous

1798.96 --> 1804.08
and i think that some people are so

1801.6 --> 1806.24
stuck to doing that

1804.08 --> 1808.32
and they're addicted to that that they

1806.24 --> 1810.559
develop multiple online personality

1808.32 --> 1812.24
disorder that they literally go about

1810.559 --> 1816.32
different places

1812.24 --> 1818.24
and try a completely different person

1816.32 --> 1819.4399999999998
and then eventually they'll end up like

1818.24 --> 1823.84
online

1819.44 --> 1827.6000000000001
cross yeah cross-roading themselves

1823.84 --> 1827.6
their other character even

1827.76 --> 1831.279
i think that actually happens

1833.6 --> 1837.84
and those are actually really tough to

1835.679 --> 1837.8400000000001
spot

1839.52 --> 1845.52
right

1840.88 --> 1845.5200000000002
but those people never show their faces

1847.279 --> 1851.84
because you can't really fake your face

1853.679 --> 1857.039
that's

1854.48 --> 1859.919
like yeah although and if you do then

1857.039 --> 1861.76
it's not your face so

1859.919 --> 1865.5590000000002
right so that is really what the idea

1861.76 --> 1865.559
was derived from

1875.919 --> 1880.64
the biggest problem is that it is fun

1877.44 --> 1883.2
enough to be addicted yeah

1880.64 --> 1884.88
and i bet that a lot of them like get

1883.2 --> 1886.72
really addictive when they start

1884.88 --> 1890.919
thinking about themselves as some kind

1886.72 --> 1890.919
of online super spy

1898.32 --> 1900.6399999999999
right

1901.519 --> 1906.08
so just constantly here

1904.24 --> 1907.44
mission impossible music theme in the

1906.08 --> 1910.08
background in their mind and they're

1907.44 --> 1913.44
like oh yeah i'm going in oh i'm gonna

1910.08 --> 1915.4399999999998
show worlds oh i'm gonna

1913.44 --> 1917.6000000000001
i'm gonna get to the bottom of this of

1915.44 --> 1921.8400000000001
these people and then

1917.6 --> 1921.84
maybe find out some secrets or something

1922.08 --> 1926.0
until they realize like oh wait no no

1924.32 --> 1929.12
they're actually quite honest and then

1926.0 --> 1929.12
they just lose interest

1933.12 --> 1939.32
or they start fabricating

1936.32 --> 1939.32
anyway

1959.519 --> 1965.6
cosplay with the 501 stormtroopers

1963.679 --> 1967.1200000000001
i'm sure

1965.6 --> 1968.6399999999999
i mean

1967.12 --> 1972.0
i would

1968.64 --> 1972.0
yeah that would be amazing

1972.96 --> 1976.159
i mean

1974.0 --> 1977.76
it would be pretty epic to just have

1976.159 --> 1980.0
like

1977.76 --> 1982.24
if you just had all the costumes you

1980.0 --> 1985.2
could lit it's not that difficult to

1982.24 --> 1988.159
just make like a

1985.2 --> 1991.679
a bit cheaper probably star wars movie

1988.159 --> 1993.919
you could yeah you could just do that

1991.679 --> 1995.76
if you just have those costumes

1993.919 --> 1997.6000000000001
and it would be pretty epic to kind of

1995.76 --> 2000.72
direct scenes with

1997.6 --> 2000.7199999999998
like lots of people

2000.96 --> 2006.96
like that like some even if it's just

2003.6 --> 2009.12
like once sk sketch doesn't have to be a

2006.96 --> 2011.2
movie just a scene

2009.12 --> 2012.799
of like a combat of stormtroopers

2011.2 --> 2016.96
against a couple of jedi i mean that

2012.799 --> 2016.96
could be pretty cool and you really need

2017.36 --> 2021.6789999999999
very limited things except for the

2019.12 --> 2021.6789999999999
costumes

2024.96 --> 2030.08
a cosplay yeah but

2027.2 --> 2032.3990000000001
just cosplay is just like oh i'm having

2030.08 --> 2036.399
that's just like oh look at my costume

2032.399 --> 2036.399
and not actually being in character

2039.36 --> 2043.6
i'm not a big fan of just cosplaying

2042.08 --> 2045.6
i mean if you're gonna dress up as

2043.6 --> 2048.0789999999997
something you gotta like

2045.6 --> 2050.159
be in the character

2048.079 --> 2053.7200000000003
otherwise you're just an ass with a

2050.159 --> 2053.7200000000003
costume on

2067.119 --> 2073.0
how long have i been living here

2069.52 --> 2073.0
uh 2014.

2074.079 --> 2077.639
it's been a while

2095.04 --> 2099.44
doesn't cosplay deal with acting as the

2097.52 --> 2102.68
character sometimes no

2099.44 --> 2102.68
it's cosplay

2102.8 --> 2108.6800000000003
if you're going to be acting in

2104.079 --> 2108.6800000000003
character then it's a larp

2116.88 --> 2120.7200000000003
cosplay is like for models

2120.84 --> 2124.159
[Music]

2125.119 --> 2130.32
have i ever done acting

2126.88 --> 2132.079
since school yeah sure

2130.32 --> 2134.96
i mean as a kid i did

2132.079 --> 2134.96
a school place

2136.0 --> 2140.4
i

2137.92 --> 2141.6800000000003
i really never deeply got into acting i

2140.4 --> 2145.04
just always

2141.68 --> 2147.68
did everything on my own men never went

2145.04 --> 2151.92
to like acting theater but

2147.68 --> 2154.16
there is a very distinct reason for that

2151.92 --> 2158.92
you might guess

2154.16 --> 2158.92
very easily what that reason is

2164.88 --> 2169.0
it starts within g

2177.68 --> 2180.96
what would be a dream role if you could

2179.92 --> 2183.44
have one

2180.96 --> 2186.16
a dream role would be to have a role in

2183.44 --> 2187.76
a movie where i'm not surrounded by gays

2186.16 --> 2189.2799999999997
that want to

2187.76 --> 2192.48
pump me

2189.28 --> 2195.2000000000003
after this scene's done shooting that's

2192.48 --> 2197.119
my dream role could be anything

2195.2 --> 2199.52
i just don't want to be surrounded by

2197.119 --> 2199.52
gays

2199.76 --> 2203.8390000000004
or at least not

2201.2 --> 2206.16
be made aware of that

2203.839 --> 2207.2
i mean there's gonna be gays but then

2206.16 --> 2210.64
they have to

2207.2 --> 2213.64
keep it to themselves damn it

2210.64 --> 2213.64
uh

2221.359 --> 2224.72
yeah no [ __ ] sherlock

2227.68 --> 2231.9199999999996
but a dream wrote look i can do a lot of

2230.079 --> 2235.04
different roles

2231.92 --> 2235.04
i mean serious

2235.44 --> 2238.56
but

2236.24 --> 2241.2799999999997
i would not like want to be known as a

2238.56 --> 2243.52
really creepy figure or anything with my

2241.28 --> 2246.32
face

2243.52 --> 2248.16
as in a movie is it like it would break

2246.32 --> 2251.52
through certain borders that i don't

2248.16 --> 2254.839
want to be seen

2251.52 --> 2257.92
so i would always kind of prefer being a

2254.839 --> 2260.4
good character with like inner struggles

2257.92 --> 2265.6800000000003
or something probably

2260.4 --> 2268.64
but expressive you see i i kind of hate

2265.68 --> 2270.72
the broody role that's never saying

2268.64 --> 2273.44
anything oh you're so cool

2270.72 --> 2273.4399999999996
i hate that

2273.839 --> 2278.7999999999997
no if i'm gonna be a broody character

2275.68 --> 2282.0789999999997
i'm gonna be freaking dynamic and like

2278.8 --> 2285.32
actually scary sometimes as i i guess i

2282.079 --> 2285.32
can be

2285.599 --> 2290.4
but also

2286.88 --> 2291.76
likable and extremely interesting

2290.4 --> 2293.839
in some way

2291.76 --> 2297.48
anyway i don't know man i don't know

2293.839 --> 2297.48
what kind of role

2300.079 --> 2304.32
but i don't it's not going to happen

2307.839 --> 2312.599
ugh terry thanks for that but yeah

2329.839 --> 2332.0789999999997
oh

2336.56 --> 2339.52
you know what would be a pretty cool

2338.079 --> 2344.4
role for me

2339.52 --> 2344.4
let's say in a star wars movie or series

2344.48 --> 2348.119
a jedi teacher

2357.119 --> 2360.6400000000003
i mean i've always wanted to be yoda i

2359.04 --> 2364.92
just don't want to be a little green

2360.64 --> 2364.92
puppet with a silly voice permanently

2372.88 --> 2378.48
although i could double roll that

2376.079 --> 2378.48
all right

2379.28 --> 2384.96
i could do with

2380.839 --> 2384.96
you little yoda

2386.72 --> 2390.3999999999996
yeah not it's not working right now

2390.88 --> 2395.44
probably have to yeah probably have to

2392.8 --> 2396.4
like do that separately record that

2395.44 --> 2398.8
separately

2396.4 --> 2398.8
anyway

2404.64 --> 2410.7999999999997
a movie that ends bad forever no

2408.4 --> 2412.4
that sucks

2410.8 --> 2414.88
you want to roll in that that is so

2412.4 --> 2414.88
typical

2416.24 --> 2421.72
that's jordan peterson what the [ __ ] are

2418.16 --> 2421.72
you talking about

2442.319 --> 2445.319
so

2454.319 --> 2458.96
okay everybody's uh what am i gonna be

2459.68 --> 2465.0789999999997
yeah

2461.599 --> 2465.079
good luck with that

2466.88 --> 2470.2400000000002
well

2468.079 --> 2473.04
if you really want to be a specific type

2470.24 --> 2476.04
of role in something you got to do it

2473.04 --> 2476.04
yourself

2490.16 --> 2494.48
all right just realize that they're

2491.76 --> 2498.4
really good actors

2494.48 --> 2501.04
usually make it seem really easy

2498.4 --> 2507.0
the reality however is is that actual

2501.04 --> 2507.0
good movie acting is not easy at all

2527.599 --> 2530.0
okay

2535.76 --> 2539.6400000000003
that's a larry's name

2574.319 --> 2577.319
right

2594.96 --> 2597.96
hmm

2620.64 --> 2625.2799999999997
okay lg and

2622.48 --> 2628.52
is your son's name gonna be

2625.28 --> 2628.52
will be

2674.8 --> 2678.2400000000002
i mean if it's going to be like a

2676.079 --> 2681.119
steampunk family flick that sounds

2678.24 --> 2681.1189999999997
really interesting

2684.48 --> 2688.0
i mean

2685.52 --> 2688.0
how many

2688.56 --> 2693.04
family centered movies do you even see

2693.2 --> 2696.3999999999996
in fantasy or

2697.04 --> 2702.7599999999998
science fiction

2698.96 --> 2702.76
there's not a lot of that

2717.119 --> 2721.119
like one of the few examples that i

2718.96 --> 2722.7200000000003
would think of would be like lost in

2721.119 --> 2726.2400000000002
space right

2722.72 --> 2727.68
that's like a real family oriented

2726.24 --> 2730.0789999999997
franchise

2727.68 --> 2732.56
sorry

2730.079 --> 2734.96
i mean it's been multiple movies and a

2732.56 --> 2734.96
series

2738.64 --> 2742.96
but sounds interesting

2740.56 --> 2745.7599999999998
like a family like several generations

2742.96 --> 2748.76
like going about in like steampunk punk

2745.76 --> 2748.76
zeppelins

2770.64 --> 2775.5989999999997
and if you got cg to back it up then you

2773.839 --> 2777.7599999999998
could get in all kinds of beautiful

2775.599 --> 2779.2000000000003
landscapes and [ __ ]

2777.76 --> 2782.5600000000004
and you could even

2779.2 --> 2782.56
make it like oh we're a

2783.92 --> 2789.599
a privately owned air taxi

2787.52 --> 2791.44
and potential hotel

2789.599 --> 2792.4
like you have an airship you can take on

2791.44 --> 2795.359
guests

2792.4 --> 2799.56
for transport or for stay

2795.359 --> 2799.56
and you're going all over the world

2802.079 --> 2807.3590000000004
and dude anything can happen you can

2803.68 --> 2809.359
live like oh [ __ ] wars breaking out or

2807.359 --> 2812.72
or you could make it uh

2809.359 --> 2816.2
a meteor or a disaster or whatever dude

2812.72 --> 2816.2
could go anywhere

2822.8 --> 2826.8390000000004
rocketeer yeah yeah

2839.599 --> 2844.079
dude come over what the [ __ ] is wrong

2841.76 --> 2846.3190000000004
with you man

2844.079 --> 2848.7200000000003
kind of an example is that of a family

2846.319 --> 2848.72
movie

2849.839 --> 2856.92
that's those are not horror is not

2852.48 --> 2856.92
family movies ass

2880.48 --> 2884.72
yeah okay fine gortilla just thought it

2882.64 --> 2887.52
was really inappropriate and dark to

2884.72 --> 2890.0
even bring that off i mean like why

2887.52 --> 2892.24
talking about just

2890.0 --> 2894.48
fun things and fun movie concepts why

2892.24 --> 2895.52
the hell would you bring up chincho

2894.48 --> 2896.8
music

2895.52 --> 2899.7599999999998
dude

2896.8 --> 2902.6400000000003
that just sucks

2899.76 --> 2907.1600000000003
bring that up why draw that in

2902.64 --> 2907.16
it's not funny it's just gross

2920.72 --> 2924.52
hello by the way godzilla

2935.92 --> 2938.92
mm-hmm

2948.319 --> 2955.5589999999997
okay okay anyway

2951.68 --> 2955.5589999999997
we're talking about again

2956.16 --> 2958.5589999999997
oh yeah

2959.44 --> 2963.68
it's just expanding upon elise g's idea

2962.559 --> 2966.88
of

2963.68 --> 2966.8799999999997
a steampunk

2967.92 --> 2970.88
like family

2969.52 --> 2972.8
series

2970.88 --> 2974.8
and then i took it really serious and

2972.8 --> 2977.119
almost made a netflix series out of it

2974.8 --> 2979.6800000000003
virtually

2977.119 --> 2979.6800000000003
who knows

2981.52 --> 2985.599
who knows they might do something or

2983.119 --> 2987.52
maybe that already exists

2985.599 --> 2989.3590000000004
i mean there's so many things out now

2987.52 --> 2991.28
it's just that i don't really tend to

2989.359 --> 2994.0789999999997
click them because

2991.28 --> 2998.3590000000004
you just get to be get flashed by actors

2994.079 --> 2998.3590000000004
that just make me feel nauseated

3005.04 --> 3009.839
right so it's really tough for me these

3007.52 --> 3012.4
days to for me to even try out something

3009.839 --> 3013.359
new that i don't know on netflix

3012.4 --> 3016.559
because

3013.359 --> 3018.4
it all just looks so gross

3016.559 --> 3019.599
a lot of it

3018.4 --> 3020.96
just so

3019.599 --> 3025.88
kitsch

3020.96 --> 3025.88
like the action is becoming kitsch

3026.4 --> 3030.559
a lot of things

3028.72 --> 3033.68
styles it's like it's becoming

3030.559 --> 3035.92
oversaturated too formulaic

3033.68 --> 3038.0789999999997
it's just palpable now

3035.92 --> 3041.6800000000003
it's like oh we got all these brilliant

3038.079 --> 3045.6800000000003
looking actors and all this cgi and

3041.68 --> 3048.0
and look we've got the geography the uh

3045.68 --> 3051.04
the choreography with the fights all

3048.0 --> 3055.839
also so fleshy but it's just like

3051.04 --> 3055.839
there's nothing there it's so boring

3057.92 --> 3062.16
like where's the actual interesting

3059.839 --> 3062.16
parts

3066.24 --> 3071.2
the movie called the professor yeah the

3068.72 --> 3073.68
professors is a really cool movie i like

3071.2 --> 3073.68
that one

3079.92 --> 3085.119
don't see where you're getting the mk

3082.0 --> 3085.119
ultra vibes from

3086.319 --> 3090.2799999999997
it was a bit weird though

3098.0 --> 3101.0
stupiders

3101.119 --> 3106.44
really

3103.44 --> 3106.44
really

3117.2 --> 3121.1189999999997
oh so you weren't actually referencing a

3119.44 --> 3124.0
good movie then

3121.119 --> 3127.28
surprise surprise thanks akuma virus for

3124.0 --> 3129.599
all these [ __ ] movie inserts

3127.28 --> 3132.6400000000003
look if you're really really interested

3129.599 --> 3134.319
in shitty shitty quality movies

3132.64 --> 3138.2
why don't you go look

3134.319 --> 3138.2
into dingo pictures

3139.2 --> 3142.0789999999997
don't watch that

3143.68 --> 3148.64
i mean i think i can safely say that

3146.16 --> 3150.64
that is like the lowest quality worst

3148.64 --> 3152.64
written

3150.64 --> 3154.0
terribly voice acted

3152.64 --> 3156.4
series of

3154.0 --> 3159.119
rip-off cartoon movies that i've ever

3156.4 --> 3160.64
seen that are officially published

3159.119 --> 3162.48
i mean there's a lot of crap out there

3160.64 --> 3164.8799999999997
on the internet that's

3162.48 --> 3167.68
not really official

3164.88 --> 3170.2400000000002
this is i want to see something shitty

3167.68 --> 3174.52
go watch that

3170.24 --> 3174.52
i'm sure it'll shut you up

3193.2 --> 3198.0
i haven't seen a presentable movie in a

3195.44 --> 3198.0
great while

3202.48 --> 3209.119
i mean some movies are like

3204.88 --> 3212.2400000000002
yeah they are pretty okay

3209.119 --> 3213.359
and like oh they got all the cgo great

3212.24 --> 3215.839
and all that

3213.359 --> 3215.839
but then

3216.48 --> 3222.599
it's getting old man

3218.4 --> 3222.599
it's just not working anymore

3228.72 --> 3234.0789999999997
and it's like things are becoming too

3230.4 --> 3237.839
kitsch it's like over saturated with cgi

3234.079 --> 3238.7200000000003
a good example for that would be

3237.839 --> 3241.92
this is

3238.72 --> 3241.9199999999996
the doctor strange

3242.72 --> 3246.3999999999996
right

3244.559 --> 3250.96
and like all the movies where he is is

3246.4 --> 3253.6800000000003
just so incredibly oversaturated

3250.96 --> 3253.68
with stuff

3253.92 --> 3259.28
and energy things and fractals and like

3256.48 --> 3262.16
oh see look at the surreal lance and

3259.28 --> 3265.1600000000003
just like it's over saturated it's

3262.16 --> 3265.16
kitsch

3270.88 --> 3275.839
right even though it was a pretty cool

3272.8 --> 3277.119
idea they just don't use it sparingly

3275.839 --> 3279.839
enough

3277.119 --> 3282.559
they're not being wise with the powers

3279.839 --> 3285.52
that they have available to them

3282.559 --> 3285.52
in movie making

3287.52 --> 3292.96
you could say blame the script

3290.64 --> 3294.8799999999997
blame the scripts scripts are not

3292.96 --> 3298.079
exactly like

3294.88 --> 3299.44
the most well-developed things in movies

3298.079 --> 3301.119
anymore

3299.44 --> 3303.68
compared to

3301.119 --> 3307.839
well say 50 years ago

3303.68 --> 3307.839
where it was only about the script

3308.48 --> 3314.079
there was just much more

3310.48 --> 3316.319
value in good script writing back then

3314.079 --> 3320.079
now it's like oh if we just have enough

3316.319 --> 3322.64
money we could just pump in the cgi and

3320.079 --> 3324.0
and it'll be all right some high-profile

3322.64 --> 3327.5589999999997
actors

3324.0 --> 3327.559
it'll be cool

3342.64 --> 3348.04
oh god you watched fall

3345.04 --> 3348.04
ah

3348.16 --> 3351.839
i'm not watching that thanks

3355.76 --> 3359.44
from what i've seen it is actually a

3357.599 --> 3362.88
good concept movie

3359.44 --> 3366.319
but it is like a just a like anxious

3362.88 --> 3368.48
thriller and i don't like it

3366.319 --> 3370.079
for that

3368.48 --> 3372.0
i mean i have

3370.079 --> 3373.599
issues with heights so i'm not gonna

3372.0 --> 3376.92
freaking watch that i'm not gonna do

3373.599 --> 3376.92
that to myself

3408.079 --> 3410.4
really

3410.88 --> 3415.799
they used ai to remove f-bombs

3418.88 --> 3421.88
huh

3434.0 --> 3438.559
your dad watched nascar and it looked

3436.0 --> 3438.559
cgi

3441.44 --> 3444.0
i don't know

3444.079 --> 3447.079
weird

3456.16 --> 3461.44
i mean usually you know it's not cgi the

3459.44 --> 3465.119
moment like nascar

3461.44 --> 3465.119
cars crashes and and all that

3467.839 --> 3472.2
if that happened i don't know

3500.72 --> 3506.72
is there a way to determine if it's real

3502.72 --> 3509.1189999999997
or fake yes yes there is dank

3506.72 --> 3512.48
it's the same thing i mean

3509.119 --> 3512.48
it's still photoshop

3513.119 --> 3516.4
it's still gonna have

3515.04 --> 3518.24
original data

3516.4 --> 3519.76
to what you're seeing that can be

3518.24 --> 3521.9199999999996
analyzed through

3519.76 --> 3525.599
video photoshop basically

3521.92 --> 3525.599
video forensics yeah you can

3525.68 --> 3532.0
figure out whether there is editing

3527.28 --> 3533.92
going on or whether it's a original full

3532.0 --> 3536.24
playing playout

3533.92 --> 3536.2400000000002
yeah

3540.88 --> 3545.92
so yeah dank you can actually

3544.559 --> 3548.0
figure out

3545.92 --> 3549.44
if something is a deep fake but yeah it

3548.0 --> 3552.0
does take some

3549.44 --> 3552.0
research

3554.24 --> 3559.4399999999996
main problem with deep fake is is that

3556.559 --> 3561.599
you might bump into it and just not even

3559.44 --> 3564.559
have a trace of realization that it is

3561.599 --> 3566.88
fake in that moment and then just

3564.559 --> 3568.799
think in your mind like it's real

3566.88 --> 3570.7200000000003
that's the main problem

3568.799 --> 3573.839
when it comes to like court evidence

3570.72 --> 3573.839
there's still recourse

3590.559 --> 3593.6800000000003
we'll be creating complete scenes from

3592.559 --> 3596.7200000000003
scratch

3593.68 --> 3596.72
yeah that doesn't matter

3599.76 --> 3606.3190000000004
any type of cgi-based fabrication leaves

3603.76 --> 3609.3190000000004
traces

3606.319 --> 3609.319
always

3635.2 --> 3642.839
what are you talking about

3638.0 --> 3642.839
dusty flint gravels what

3643.839 --> 3647.64
hater studio 68.

3691.44 --> 3697.079
does anybody have any idea what dusty is

3693.68 --> 3697.0789999999997
talking about

3705.359 --> 3708.359
hey

3720.16 --> 3723.16
do

3744.319 --> 3748.48
okay because it did sort of remind me

3746.72 --> 3751.9199999999996
about this

3748.48 --> 3753.76
science fiction idea

3751.92 --> 3755.52
of the ion

3753.76 --> 3758.48
system

3755.52 --> 3761.359
a passive propulsion

3758.48 --> 3764.359
for inspirous travel but yeah that's

3761.359 --> 3764.359
ridiculous

3769.2 --> 3776.1189999999997
it could yeah dusty hey i still don't

3771.839 --> 3776.119
know what the hell you're talking about

3820.799 --> 3827.52
i still have no idea what the hell

3824.48 --> 3827.52
you're talking about

3830.88 --> 3836.1600000000003
i just see a word neural link that's

3833.119 --> 3837.6800000000003
like oh oh so that means die now under

3836.16 --> 3840.48
no i still don't know what the hell

3837.68 --> 3840.48
you're talking about

3845.52 --> 3849.839
purge negative ions before they get

3848.319 --> 3853.0389999999998
siven

3849.839 --> 3854.48
what the [ __ ] does that mean what in

3853.039 --> 3855.92
what

3854.48 --> 3857.2
in your head

3855.92 --> 3859.44
what is this

3857.2 --> 3861.68
purging negative i i don't know what

3859.44 --> 3864.319
you're talking about

3861.68 --> 3867.319
could you just [ __ ] make sense

3864.319 --> 3867.319
already

3880.03 --> 3883.079
[Music]

3887.57 --> 3890.989
[Music]

3895.92 --> 3900.799
okay dusty the next thing you're gonna

3898.079 --> 3903.76
say in my chat better be a very

3900.799 --> 3905.7599999999998
elaborate and detailed and concise

3903.76 --> 3909.8390000000004
explanation as to what the [ __ ] you're

3905.76 --> 3909.8390000000004
talking about i'm kicking you out

3916.4 --> 3922.2000000000003
a battery

3919.2 --> 3922.2
okay

3932.0 --> 3936.92
i got no no dank i don't have steam

3937.039 --> 3941.8390000000004
but there's been steam games that i

3938.799 --> 3945.119
could just download

3941.839 --> 3948.68
most games i just downloaded

3945.119 --> 3948.6800000000003
a cracked version

3954.559 --> 3957.76
what game what's the name

3960.72 --> 3965.1189999999997
okay so right dusty

3962.88 --> 3967.92
cute

3965.119 --> 3967.92
depletion

3968.64 --> 3973.16
let's try to put this all into context

3979.92 --> 3986.799
ionic siphoning of the frontal lobes

3983.68 --> 3989.799
due to bad movies

3986.799 --> 3989.799
what

3993.2 --> 3996.5589999999997
a valve implant

4002.4 --> 4007.839
what

4004.0 --> 4007.839
it still doesn't make sense then

4007.92 --> 4012.48
so there's an effect i don't see how it

4010.4 --> 4015.119
connects to anything

4012.48 --> 4017.599
the depletion of negative ions and then

4015.119 --> 4020.599
you feel drain or something

4017.599 --> 4020.599
what

4021.359 --> 4023.7599999999998
and then

4024.16 --> 4030.319
elon wants a valve implant

4027.76 --> 4033.6400000000003
like what the [ __ ] nothing about this

4030.319 --> 4033.64
makes sense

4055.52 --> 4061.0389999999998
tap into the viewer's mind and after

4058.0 --> 4062.88
yeah dude they they do all that all the

4061.039 --> 4066.0
time

4062.88 --> 4068.319
just called influencing depends on alpha

4066.0 --> 4070.4
wave state it's completely up to the

4068.319 --> 4071.52
viewer whether they allow that to happen

4070.4 --> 4073.44
or not

4071.52 --> 4075.44
when you do when you get interfaced you

4073.44 --> 4078.88
get programmed that's been happening

4075.44 --> 4082.079
since the 50s that's the default

4078.88 --> 4084.4
effect of any media

4082.079 --> 4086.6400000000003
any media

4084.4 --> 4088.96
including mine by the way

4086.64 --> 4092.799
it's just all media does that

4088.96 --> 4095.44
get an option are you just gonna

4092.799 --> 4095.44
open up

4096.56 --> 4103.080000000001
or are you actually gonna

4098.96 --> 4103.08
have filters for yourself

4104.319 --> 4107.52
particle what the [ __ ]

4114.719 --> 4119.12
it's not a wave

4116.48 --> 4121.919999999999
it's an alpha state it's a specific

4119.12 --> 4125.759
mental state

4121.92 --> 4125.759
let's describe these frequencies

4126.239 --> 4131.12
i don't know if it's literal waves i

4128.159 --> 4134.159
think that anything mental is electric

4131.12 --> 4134.159
and it's a field

4134.4 --> 4139.92
they do call it brain waves but it

4136.4 --> 4142.879999999999
doesn't make any sense actually

4139.92 --> 4142.88
not particles

4145.279 --> 4148.319
that's right godzilla

4150.56 --> 4157.120000000001
right but yeah but the thing is

4153.44 --> 4158.639999999999
you don't need even television

4157.12 --> 4161.599999999999
somebody could just

4158.64 --> 4162.96
that you trust can just indoctrinate you

4161.6 --> 4165.4400000000005
with something

4162.96 --> 4166.719
or like bless you you could see it as a

4165.44 --> 4168.96
blessing

4166.719 --> 4172.4
you take it you open up you let them

4168.96 --> 4172.4
program you in that moment

4172.56 --> 4177.52
you don't need anything for that

4175.759 --> 4178.799
you just need

4177.52 --> 4181.52
the will

4178.799 --> 4181.5199999999995
to do that

4182.0 --> 4186.48
the will to have that happen to you the

4184.239 --> 4189.48
decision that you're gonna allow that to

4186.48 --> 4189.48
happen

4203.199 --> 4207.04
binaural beats now the headphones change

4205.92 --> 4210.679
the way you feel

4207.04 --> 4212.88
sure i bet there's just like oh

4210.679 --> 4214.2390000000005
non-cultural things and then oh you do

4212.88 --> 4218.400000000001
this little thing and it'll calm you

4214.239 --> 4222.48
down yeah well i can do that too just by

4218.4 --> 4222.48
listening to certain types of music

4222.88 --> 4225.6
for example

4226.64 --> 4230.56
right it's just you seek the remedy that

4229.199 --> 4232.0
you know will

4230.56 --> 4234.159000000001
remedy

4232.0 --> 4235.6
the frequencies of the situation that

4234.159 --> 4238.159
you're facing

4235.6 --> 4241.120000000001
it's not that difficult you don't need

4238.159 --> 4243.679
some specially created

4241.12 --> 4246.159
oh this will calm you down you could do

4243.679 --> 4248.8
that but there you could also just

4246.159 --> 4251.599999999999
pick your own

4248.8 --> 4254.64
things for that

4251.6 --> 4256.8
remember that's what people used to do

4254.64 --> 4258.56
it's like oh this is my music this

4256.8 --> 4261.719
brings me in the frequency where i want

4258.56 --> 4261.719
to be

4292.32 --> 4296.239
okay dusty

4293.84 --> 4299.88
you're making it very over complicated

4296.239 --> 4299.879999999999
but sure

4326.96 --> 4328.719
yeah

4327.679 --> 4330.88
that's a good

4328.719 --> 4336.04
comparison lsd yeah

4330.88 --> 4336.04
poetry emotion much more than music

4342.08 --> 4345.92
it's just a little rhythmic dance with

4344.0 --> 4348.32
it with a message

4345.92 --> 4348.32
that's it

4353.44 --> 4357.839999999999
today's long show day yeah it could be

4378.0 --> 4381.44
yeah dusty we're not really talking

4380.239 --> 4383.28
about that

4381.44 --> 4386.159
anymore

4383.28 --> 4386.159
you are but

4387.76 --> 4391.52
it seems like the rest of the chess

4389.36 --> 4394.679
moves on to rap and whether it's music

4391.52 --> 4394.679
or not

4398.48 --> 4403.12
that's right gorzilla rapport never was

4400.719 --> 4406.8
grassroots

4403.12 --> 4408.0
jazz was grassroots

4406.8 --> 4411.320000000001
blues

4408.0 --> 4411.32
was grassroots

4418.56 --> 4423.679
and yeah i wonder like even if funk for

4421.6 --> 4426.719
example was grassroots i think that funk

4423.679 --> 4429.76
already was

4426.719 --> 4431.44
just like rap i think that funk

4429.76 --> 4432.400000000001
like disco

4431.44 --> 4434.159
right

4432.4 --> 4437.199
that was like

4434.159 --> 4438.879999999999
the first corporatized music

4437.199 --> 4440.879999999999
system thing

4438.88 --> 4443.76
thing

4440.88 --> 4443.76
most of it is

4443.84 --> 4447.28
it's very systematic

4449.92 --> 4454.4800000000005
right i don't think funk really was

4452.0 --> 4457.679
grassroots it was all

4454.48 --> 4459.839999999999
already kind of the industrialized music

4457.679 --> 4463.84
but the original roots of all those

4459.84 --> 4465.92
things funk and rap is basically jazz

4463.84 --> 4469.679
and blues

4465.92 --> 4471.92
those are absolutely grassroots

4469.679 --> 4472.64
those are some black folk that have just

4471.92 --> 4475.76
like

4472.64 --> 4479.12
gotten through a very very tough world

4475.76 --> 4481.04
and they just held on to doing their art

4479.12 --> 4485.64
it's very different

4481.04 --> 4485.64
from the music industry era

4505.36 --> 4509.28
right funk yeah the bands play the wrong

4507.6 --> 4511.52
music yeah right but it's just like rock

4509.28 --> 4513.5199999999995
and roll right rock and roll was also

4511.52 --> 4515.76
very much created

4513.52 --> 4517.84
very much created

4515.76 --> 4519.360000000001
but then bands would just do their own

4517.84 --> 4523.719
rock and roll

4519.36 --> 4523.719
and the same thing happened with funk

4530.4 --> 4532.639999999999
but with rap

4531.92 --> 4535.36
yeah

4532.64 --> 4538.719
funk was also kind of weapon i funk like

4535.36 --> 4541.92
really try to ram the gay in there

4538.719 --> 4543.92
didn't it didn't it just blatantly try

4541.92 --> 4547.88
to do that

4543.92 --> 4547.88
disco and funk

4552.159 --> 4559.719
rap really ran through just

4555.28 --> 4559.719
like yeah criminal behavior

4581.28 --> 4585.36
yeah maybe funk not so much with a

4583.12 --> 4587.76
little they were very liberal and

4585.36 --> 4590.239
tolerant of that [ __ ]

4587.76 --> 4595.8
the disco was just straight out gay yeah

4590.239 --> 4595.799999999999
rollerblades you know the score on that

4607.199 --> 4610.879999999999
wasn't anything gay about funk

4615.04 --> 4619.36
i think i may have mixed them up because

4616.8 --> 4620.96
funk and disco kind of like were in the

4619.36 --> 4622.639999999999
same

4620.96 --> 4624.8
yeah

4622.64 --> 4626.4800000000005
it's just a slightly different system

4624.8 --> 4628.96
but

4626.48 --> 4631.678999999999
same period

4628.96 --> 4631.679
i'm not sure

4632.0 --> 4636.4
disco is definitely very gay funk maybe

4634.48 --> 4639.04
less

4636.4 --> 4640.879999999999
they were all very liberal though like

4639.04 --> 4644.56
the whole thing about funk is that it

4640.88 --> 4644.56
was all extremely liberal

4645.76 --> 4648.88
and not like

4647.199 --> 4652.0
old-fashioned

4648.88 --> 4654.32
like not that type of ideas or

4652.0 --> 4656.719
character portrayals it was all super

4654.32 --> 4656.719
liberal

4659.92 --> 4665.84
an old liberal by the way that's not

4662.08 --> 4665.84
nothing like liberals are now

4677.6 --> 4681.0
dude just

4704.64 --> 4707.4400000000005
let's

4706.48 --> 4711.199
yeah

4707.44 --> 4713.759999999999
a lot of funk songs were like calls to

4711.199 --> 4716.719
like personal motivation and action it's

4713.76 --> 4717.84
like oh get it moving

4716.719 --> 4721.32
yeah

4717.84 --> 4721.32
that is true

4722.159 --> 4727.92
my parents were like a lot into funk

4724.159 --> 4727.92
they even had like a funk band

4728.239 --> 4730.718999999999
together

4732.4 --> 4735.839999999999
i grew up in that

4744.719 --> 4749.84
all right see you later godzilla thanks

4746.4 --> 4749.839999999999
for popping by

4763.36 --> 4767.759999999999
the white funk is disco goody

4774.88 --> 4779.04
i don't know i don't think so

4788.0 --> 4793.52
disco was just different

4790.56 --> 4796.159000000001
disco is much more

4793.52 --> 4798.400000000001
starting to become like house music

4796.159 --> 4801.04
became just more

4798.4 --> 4804.879999999999
a basic system like

4801.04 --> 4805.84
the disco was so [ __ ] dumb it was all

4804.88 --> 4806.8
so

4805.84 --> 4810.0
dumb

4806.8 --> 4812.320000000001
every message it was all [ __ ] i've

4810.0 --> 4814.239
never heard a disco song that didn't

4812.32 --> 4818.32
make me wonder like

4814.239 --> 4820.959999999999
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] if you like this

4818.32 --> 4824.0
every single disco song i've ever heard

4820.96 --> 4825.6
was always like really appallingly

4824.0 --> 4828.32
[ __ ]

4825.6 --> 4828.320000000001
in the message

4830.159 --> 4833.839999999999
does anybody else notice that

4842.239 --> 4845.959999999999
is that just me

4847.12 --> 4850.96
just

4847.84 --> 4852.88
any disco song any text from a disco

4850.96 --> 4854.8
song

4852.88 --> 4857.04
have you ever heard a disco song with a

4854.8 --> 4859.52
text that isn't just straight out

4857.04 --> 4863.32
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4859.52 --> 4863.320000000001
i've never heard one

4877.18 --> 4883.319
[Music]

4885.6 --> 4889.84
you didn't like cheek i don't know what

4887.6 --> 4889.84
that is

4890.08 --> 4894.32
it's not like i've heard every disco

4892.48 --> 4896.08
song ever it's just that yeah i've heard

4894.32 --> 4897.92
a whole bunch of music i've never heard

4896.08 --> 4900.08
a disco song that just didn't make me

4897.92 --> 4900.08
wanna

4901.04 --> 4907.04
because i hate stupid i hate stupid and

4904.159 --> 4908.4
sophisticated text i hate like simpleton

4907.04 --> 4912.679
expression

4908.4 --> 4912.679
that they'd love to appeal to

4932.48 --> 4935.759999999999
i don't know what that is

4936.8 --> 4940.76

4990.48 --> 4996.4
it was mem i mean as a song right as a

4993.92 --> 4998.88

4996.4 --> 4998.879999999999
decent

4998.96 --> 5004.719
music design

5001.04 --> 5004.719

5064.32 --> 5066.639
song

5066.96 --> 5071.28
yeah it's a pretty nice song have you

5069.12 --> 5074.32
ever heard the text

5071.28 --> 5074.32
it's [ __ ]

5083.44 --> 5089.759999999999
it's about fast pace of inner city

5085.92 --> 5089.76
living yeah retards

5095.679 --> 5099.28
it's just happening to us we don't know

5097.52 --> 5101.679
what the [ __ ] going on all these

5099.28 --> 5104.159
people died all this and that oh

5101.679 --> 5106.32
just staying alive

5104.159 --> 5109.12
don't know what's actually going on wow

5106.32 --> 5111.199

5111.199 --> 5113.839999999999
keeping going

5118.08 --> 5121.679
you're just a dumbass that don't know

5119.76 --> 5123.360000000001
what the [ __ ] going on just trying to

5121.679 --> 5124.56
stay alive

5123.36 --> 5126.239
i'm sorry

5124.56 --> 5128.080000000001
maybe that's just a little harsh it's

5126.239 --> 5129.678999999999
just

5128.08 --> 5132.159
seriously i think it's a thing i think

5129.679 --> 5134.88
that every real disc or song even if

5132.159 --> 5140.12
it's kind of a nice song it's all about

5134.88 --> 5140.12
[ __ ] idiots all of it

5145.36 --> 5149.5199999999995
that's not what the song is about

5148.08 --> 5154.28
oh really

5149.52 --> 5154.280000000001
so you cannot interpret it like that

5162.96 --> 5166.199
hey kevlar

5176.239 --> 5184.48
there's some good discord songs

5179.6 --> 5184.4800000000005
and kill it soon what okay

5186.56 --> 5190.96
well i never got to hear any of the

5188.4 --> 5192.5599999999995
really good ones

5190.96 --> 5195.44
and he's just like yeah he's staying

5192.56 --> 5198.159000000001
alive yeah it was a memorable song the

5195.44 --> 5200.879999999999
melody was kind of cool it was

5198.159 --> 5203.44
decently executed

5200.88 --> 5203.4400000000005
it's just

5206.56 --> 5211.84
i just hate disco i just can't stand it

5229.6 --> 5232.6
so

5238.96 --> 5244.56
yeah funk did take over disco didn't it

5243.36 --> 5246.4
because it was there kind of

5244.56 --> 5248.8
simultaneously and then people held on

5246.4 --> 5251.04
to disco and some dove into the

5248.8 --> 5255.04
funk it's like funk was the new rock and

5251.04 --> 5255.04
roll really was that

5260.239 --> 5262.959999999999
and yeah

5265.199 --> 5269.839999999999
but this is like a lot this is like

5267.52 --> 5273.280000000001
around when i was born even so i haven't

5269.84 --> 5275.84
actually personally experienced it

5273.28 --> 5278.8
i mean i became like more music aware

5275.84 --> 5281.679
when really the house scene

5278.8 --> 5284.56
came on

5281.679 --> 5285.92
the first house and did like a hardcore

5284.56 --> 5287.92
even and

5285.92 --> 5290.56
that came became really popular when i

5287.92 --> 5291.679
was a teenager i did not care for it too

5290.56 --> 5294.320000000001
much

5291.679 --> 5296.639
especially people shaving their freaking

5294.32 --> 5296.639
heads

5298.88 --> 5301.28
never

5302.32 --> 5305.759999999999
like people were literally trying to

5304.08 --> 5309.0
make me do that

5305.76 --> 5309.0
[ __ ] off

5310.239 --> 5314.799999999999
house was the worst disco

5313.199 --> 5317.28
yeah well yeah

5314.8 --> 5317.28
it was

5319.36 --> 5324.48
but there's also been some very bizarre

5322.239 --> 5325.678999999999
and interesting house songs of like

5324.48 --> 5328.4
really

5325.679 --> 5329.92
wild stuff people that you know people

5328.4 --> 5332.719
just did that in their basement and they

5329.92 --> 5334.88
did not give a [ __ ] about what people

5332.719 --> 5337.84
were thinking about it they would just

5334.88 --> 5337.84
do their own thing

5340.88 --> 5345.28
there's some really weird wild songs

5343.44 --> 5346.96
like around the 90s

5345.28 --> 5349.36
that came out of house

5346.96 --> 5350.639
weird songs so songs that you wouldn't

5349.36 --> 5354.48
just play

5350.639 --> 5354.4800000000005
now because it's just too bizarre

5355.28 --> 5361.12
but overall yeah not a not a big fan not

5358.32 --> 5361.12
not too great

5362.56 --> 5368.639
but yeah and especially halfway the 90s

5365.36 --> 5371.12
there was a lot that was changing

5368.639 --> 5373.4400000000005
technologically and like

5371.12 --> 5376.159
you got things all of a sudden like go

5373.44 --> 5377.28
at trans and jungle

5376.159 --> 5380.799999999999
yeah

5377.28 --> 5380.8
i mean jungle is like

5380.88 --> 5387.76
a forgotten art

5383.76 --> 5390.8
yeah i recently rediscovered

5387.76 --> 5392.8
because i have a cd from like 94

5390.8 --> 5395.1990000000005
called jungle fever

5392.8 --> 5398.719
it's one giant mix

5395.199 --> 5398.719
and jungle is something else

5399.28 --> 5402.96
it really is something else

5401.52 --> 5404.0
it's like

5402.96 --> 5406.4800000000005
house

5404.0 --> 5407.76
but it's like

5406.48 --> 5409.839999999999
exotic

5407.76 --> 5412.719
fast-paced highly rhythmic and it's

5409.84 --> 5416.159000000001
always like super quick hi-hats and then

5412.719 --> 5420.88
like a massive maximum low bass that's

5416.159 --> 5422.0
doing stuff too and some some of these

5420.88 --> 5424.96
yeah

5422.0 --> 5428.08
music designers were really getting some

5424.96 --> 5430.0
magic out of that and yeah the cd that i

5428.08 --> 5432.4
have definitely has that

5430.0 --> 5435.04
love that [ __ ] i was really into it

5432.4 --> 5437.759999999999
because it just it like that stuff is

5435.04 --> 5440.719
better than coffee you put that music on

5437.76 --> 5443.76
you are going to be awake

5440.719 --> 5445.84
you're going to get going

5443.76 --> 5448.719
never hurt you're a jungle

5445.84 --> 5451.52
look it up

5448.719 --> 5453.679
right mid 90s it it kind of came out

5451.52 --> 5456.0
same time as goat trans and then

5453.679 --> 5457.92
eventually goat trans moved into side

5456.0 --> 5459.6
trans and then is with

5457.92 --> 5462.88
the advanced

5459.6 --> 5463.92
type of house music came out

5462.88 --> 5465.4400000000005
well with

5463.92 --> 5467.6
after the

5465.44 --> 5470.799999999999
where was it called again that's silly

5467.6 --> 5470.8
weirdo music uh

5471.12 --> 5473.5199999999995
[ __ ]

5475.199 --> 5478.638999999999
i even forgot the names

5479.52 --> 5483.639
what's that [ __ ] called again

5491.52 --> 5496.320000000001
dubstep right

5494.639 --> 5498.88
side trance

5496.32 --> 5500.96
sword yeah you got like this late 90s

5498.88 --> 5502.639
early 20th century like

5500.96 --> 5504.96
type of music that like was like the

5502.639 --> 5506.639
matrix is like an ultimate weirdo blend

5504.96 --> 5508.88
that you can barely identify but you

5506.639 --> 5511.28
recognize it from that era

5508.88 --> 5513.679
and then the dubstem came and then like

5511.28 --> 5517.639
the real modern wave

5513.679 --> 5517.639
started to really happen

5521.52 --> 5525.6
right

5523.199 --> 5528.239
and if you just bridge the quality the

5525.6 --> 5530.4800000000005
sound quality from them

5528.239 --> 5530.48
like

5530.639 --> 5536.0
jungle is of such a different quality as

5533.679 --> 5538.08
like house music now it's completely

5536.0 --> 5542.239
it's

5538.08 --> 5545.12
it's like almost nintendo 60-bit quality

5542.239 --> 5547.599999999999
compared to like modern

5545.12 --> 5549.599999999999
64-bit four-core

5547.6 --> 5551.76
graphics right

5549.6 --> 5554.08
it is such a different quality but what

5551.76 --> 5557.52
they did with it is just like they did

5554.08 --> 5561.84
the absolute maximum potential they got

5557.52 --> 5561.84
out of it they did their best to do that

5562.159 --> 5568.0
jungle core

5564.639 --> 5570.639
i don't know what jungle core is

5568.0 --> 5570.639
uh yeah

5572.84 --> 5577.12
accordion what the [ __ ]

5581.12 --> 5586.719
i wonder if i could play that song

5583.04 --> 5589.44
without getting like a copyright strike

5586.719 --> 5590.4800000000005
i have no idea if that even exists

5589.44 --> 5593.599999999999
anymore

5590.48 --> 5593.599999999999
it's so freaking old

5593.76 --> 5598.320000000001
but i would kind of like to

5596.159 --> 5601.199
share a sample of what that sounds like

5598.32 --> 5604.5599999999995
a good jungle song

5601.199 --> 5604.5599999999995
like actually good

5607.84 --> 5612.2390000000005
you'll recognize very outdated annoying

5610.719 --> 5614.719
old samples

5612.239 --> 5617.12
that were typically used in jungle

5614.719 --> 5619.04
but then you'll also recognize just the

5617.12 --> 5621.04
magic

5619.04 --> 5625.199
what they can do with that bass and the

5621.04 --> 5627.6
hi-hats it's it is magic really

5625.199 --> 5627.599999999999
anyway

5628.88 --> 5631.84
let's see

5638.4 --> 5641.879999999999
where is it

5645.44 --> 5649.28
oh what am i doing is not there

5653.679 --> 5658.4400000000005
you don't get a channel strikeout yeah

5659.76 --> 5666.08
yeah it's usually demonetization i know

5663.199 --> 5668.638999999999
but this thing is from 94

5666.08 --> 5672.239
and like literally nobody in the world

5668.639 --> 5675.6
probably even knows about that it exists

5672.239 --> 5678.718999999999
like this is a cd i got from like a

5675.6 --> 5680.88
an old cd store that had just really

5678.719 --> 5683.44
obscure music

5680.88 --> 5687.4800000000005
they existed in back then now it's all

5683.44 --> 5687.48
just the same [ __ ] everywhere

5692.239 --> 5695.839999999999
come on man where is it

5697.92 --> 5700.92
huh

5711.92 --> 5715.4
where is it

5717.76 --> 5723.92
and i'm gonna cut halfway in because

5719.52 --> 5726.88
it's one giant mix so it kind of starts

5723.92 --> 5728.4
halfway you still hear [ __ ] from the

5726.88 --> 5730.400000000001
other part of the song so i'm going to

5728.4 --> 5732.719
try to skip a bit of that where is this

uh

6129.76 --> 6134.280000000001
i'm still trying to find that cd

6159.36 --> 6162.36
so

6170.96 --> 6173.96
crap

6178.56 --> 6182.320000000001
weirdly enough i might not even have it

6181.04 --> 6186.4
anymore

6182.32 --> 6189.119
but i do have the entire rip off

6186.4 --> 6191.04
on my computer though

6189.119 --> 6194.239
but yeah it's probably the city is

6191.04 --> 6197.5199999999995
probably like somewhere in a in an odd

6194.239 --> 6198.638999999999
place or in a box in my storage

6197.52 --> 6202.159000000001
right but

6198.639 --> 6202.159000000001
the city is called

6204.56 --> 6207.280000000001
find it again

6212.239 --> 6215.5199999999995
yeah jungle fever

6214.239 --> 6219.839999999999
bass

6215.52 --> 6222.639
face sasha that's the guy who mixed it

6219.84 --> 6224.4800000000005
jungle fever volume one

6222.639 --> 6227.4800000000005
i didn't even know there was any other

6224.48 --> 6227.48
but

6268.88 --> 6273.36
all right but this is the music that i

6270.8 --> 6275.360000000001
really freaking loved

6273.36 --> 6278.639
when i was 15.

6275.36 --> 6282.5599999999995
also i have to say it was also because i

6278.639 --> 6282.56
was smoking the ganja man

6282.719 --> 6289.84
and it's like really trippy

6285.6 --> 6289.84
when you listen this music with that

6295.28 --> 6297.5199999999995
ah

6298.88 --> 6302.92
building up a sweat here

6311.76 --> 6314.76
oh

6321.76 --> 6326.08
anyway

6323.04 --> 6328.0
i hope you guys like that it's like in

6326.08 --> 6330.88
ages

6328.0 --> 6333.44
since i even played a song

6330.88 --> 6336.159000000001
on my show

6333.44 --> 6338.5599999999995
but since this is like from 94 and

6336.159 --> 6341.799999999999
nobody's ever heard of it i think it'll

6338.56 --> 6341.8
be safe

6348.239 --> 6353.599999999999
just looked up his name and all his info

6350.159 --> 6353.599999999999
popped up oh he's still at it

6356.719 --> 6359.84
i've never even tried that

6371.52 --> 6373.84
huh

6376.48 --> 6379.36
oh wow yeah

6379.44 --> 6384.799999999999
okay then i might

6381.92 --> 6384.8
still get a

6385.28 --> 6388.08
a music

6388.36 --> 6393.08
demonetization thing then i guess

6402.719 --> 6405.04
all right i thought it was worth it

6404.239 --> 6409.119
though

6405.04 --> 6409.119
just to dig into a bit of my past

6410.32 --> 6415.679
and i thought that with the weather it

6411.92 --> 6418.4
was also kind of appropriate

6415.679 --> 6419.92
it's called cold fresh air i mean come

6418.4 --> 6423.839999999999
on

6419.92 --> 6423.84
and it really did give that feel

6425.6 --> 6429.84
it's no big deal if i do yeah

6431.199 --> 6436.839999999999
oh no one of my shows got demonetized

6434.4 --> 6440.08
now i only have

6436.84 --> 6441.28
1350 other monetized shows

6440.08 --> 6443.84
because it's not the first time that

6441.28 --> 6443.84
happened

6446.08 --> 6454.4
there are only 27 what

6450.32 --> 6454.4
oh so he's not super high profile then

6455.52 --> 6460.0
okay

6457.44 --> 6460.0
i don't know

6465.04 --> 6471.48
good meth music ugh

6468.48 --> 6471.48
maybe

6471.679 --> 6475.88
i don't know i've never tried that

6486.8 --> 6491.679
it's it it's just like if you have

6490.08 --> 6494.239
especially when i was young i was

6491.679 --> 6496.88
hyperactive a lot and that this music

6494.239 --> 6499.839999999999
just really hit my frequency

6496.88 --> 6499.84
back then

6500.639 --> 6504.88
and then like you could either be super

6502.8 --> 6506.8
active it was like doing things or like

6504.88 --> 6509.04
programming something or

6506.8 --> 6511.04
building something in on my computer

6509.04 --> 6513.6
missing the music being active or just

6511.04 --> 6516.0
like smoking a joint and just being like

6513.6 --> 6518.0
really chill and listening to it

6516.0 --> 6520.0
and then more focusing just like on the

6518.0 --> 6522.0
jungle sounds and just feeling like

6520.0 --> 6524.159
you're in a jungle because it does that

6522.0 --> 6524.159
too

6525.679 --> 6531.4
yeah

6527.119 --> 6531.4
it's a very dynamic music

6595.92 --> 6600.159
jesus dusty that's [ __ ] up

6605.52 --> 6610.400000000001
she says don't you want to know about

6607.599 --> 6615.0
that really

6610.4 --> 6615.0
those are not comments for my chat

6626.08 --> 6630.719
anyway i hope you guys enjoyed that

6627.92 --> 6634.04
something else on the flat earth early

6630.719 --> 6634.04
bird show

6639.36 --> 6645.44
right but also just for chronological

6642.56 --> 6648.96
order like this music is what i got in

6645.44 --> 6648.96
right after the prodigy

6649.76 --> 6654.88
for this i listened to prodigy

6652.56 --> 6657.280000000001
which it's kind of close

6654.88 --> 6657.28
right it

6657.599 --> 6663.679
it's hyperactive

6659.599 --> 6666.08
just like the prodigy the early cds

6663.679 --> 6668.96
and this was just more

6666.08 --> 6672.4
more free more actually wild and in

6668.96 --> 6672.4
nature type feel

6672.8 --> 6675.8
jungle

6699.199 --> 6703.119
wait what

6700.719 --> 6704.719
did they

6703.119 --> 6707.5199999999995
robert are you sure

6704.719 --> 6712.119
ritalin back then didn't even exist back

6707.52 --> 6712.119000000001
then are you sure about that

6714.46 --> 6717.789
[Music]

6732.56 --> 6737.280000000001
okay if you say so i thought it was

6736.239 --> 6740.759999999999
yeah

6737.28 --> 6740.759999999999
created later

6770.96 --> 6776.2390000000005
yeah akuma virus yeah where the prodigy

6773.44 --> 6779.199
actually went with my [ __ ] up and all

6776.239 --> 6780.32
that and fire starter

6779.199 --> 6784.08
that's

6780.32 --> 6784.08
actually where i lost interest

6784.8 --> 6790.320000000001
that new prodigy with preferred overland

6787.76 --> 6792.96
is absolutely [ __ ]

6790.32 --> 6795.36
compared to the cds that they actually

6792.96 --> 6797.28
made before that

6795.36 --> 6800.239
the first two cds were completely

6797.28 --> 6802.239
different in nature in

6800.239 --> 6804.959999999999
deep tension frequency they were doing

6802.239 --> 6804.959999999999
other things

6805.119 --> 6809.28
and then with the fat of the land they

6807.04 --> 6812.48
just they went

6809.28 --> 6814.8
broad and they corrupted they just

6812.48 --> 6817.44
corrupted right there

6814.8 --> 6820.4800000000005
they corrupted that's what they did

6817.44 --> 6822.5599999999995
it kind of went

6820.48 --> 6823.5199999999995
gothic or something

6822.56 --> 6825.92
dark

6823.52 --> 6829.119000000001
it just turned to [ __ ]

6825.92 --> 6829.119
i didn't like it anymore

6829.52 --> 6834.400000000001
and then jungle fever took over i mean i

6831.679 --> 6837.28
still got the fat of the land city but i

6834.4 --> 6839.36
don't i think it's the least good one

6837.28 --> 6841.92
and there's even ones after that was it

6839.36 --> 6844.4
got milk or something that's just total

6841.92 --> 6844.4
[ __ ]

6845.04 --> 6847.5199999999995
crap

6846.08 --> 6848.719
gross

6847.52 --> 6852.400000000001
stupid

6848.719 --> 6854.8
not interesting lame sjw

6852.4 --> 6854.799999999999
crap

6858.0 --> 6861.0
anyway

6864.96 --> 6869.88
ugh apex twins oh my god

6902.0 --> 6905.0
foreign

6922.08 --> 6928.8
i have absolutely no idea who you guys

6924.8 --> 6928.8
are talking about not a clue

6929.36 --> 6935.0
none of those names say and tell me

6932.0 --> 6935.0
anything

6948.239 --> 6951.839999999999
hmm

6949.44 --> 6954.239
okay

6951.84 --> 6957.360000000001
yeah good to know that robert yeah that

6954.239 --> 6960.678999999999
your mom took it took you off that quick

6957.36 --> 6960.679
that's good

6965.199 --> 6970.598999999999
you really get the problem when you get

6966.88 --> 6970.599
used to it you see

6998.96 --> 7001.96
anyway

7005.04 --> 7008.04
so

7030.239 --> 7034.159
man i'm getting all sniffy all of a

7031.84 --> 7034.159000000001
sudden

7034.719 --> 7038.92
maybe i got a jungle fever

7048.239 --> 7052.4
i was younger everybody in the post

7049.84 --> 7054.88
office smoked cigarettes yeah

7052.4 --> 7056.839999999999
well i worked in the post office too for

7054.88 --> 7061.76
a while when i was like

7056.84 --> 7065.4400000000005
17. and yeah people just smoked there

7061.76 --> 7067.1990000000005
and then certainly oh no smoking is evil

7065.44 --> 7068.638999999999
that happened in the late 90s and then

7067.199 --> 7071.28
suddenly

7068.639 --> 7075.119
now you can't smoke anywhere

7071.28 --> 7077.84
it was really [ __ ] annoying

7075.119 --> 7077.839999999999
i mean i don't

7081.04 --> 7087.5199999999995
it's just they pushed it too hard

7084.8 --> 7092.04
now so if you're a smoker you're bad

7087.52 --> 7092.040000000001
i really hated that they did that

7111.36 --> 7116.239
it used to be ashtrays in the tablet

7113.44 --> 7116.239
restaurant yeah

7120.239 --> 7125.718999999999
airplanes that are straight on the arm

7122.239 --> 7125.718999999999
right yeah yeah

7144.239 --> 7150.08
governments endorsed smoking for years

7146.96 --> 7152.8
yeah endorsed do

7150.08 --> 7154.48
they normalized it

7152.8 --> 7156.2390000000005
literally if it's like everything is

7154.48 --> 7157.839999999999
adapted to it that's called normalized

7156.239 --> 7160.0
so first they normalize and get a whole

7157.84 --> 7162.4800000000005
bunch of people addicted

7160.0 --> 7166.159
and then suddenly oh now it's not you're

7162.48 --> 7166.159
not supposed to do that anymore

7167.199 --> 7171.839999999999
very annoying

7169.44 --> 7174.4
but yeah my view the main problem was

7171.84 --> 7176.8
always that just the quality

7174.4 --> 7180.0
of the big tobacco

7176.8 --> 7180.0
that was the real problem

7180.96 --> 7185.199
i mean they could have fixed this entire

7182.639 --> 7186.719
situation without banning it by simply

7185.199 --> 7189.759999999999
just having

7186.719 --> 7191.92
good ventilation everywhere designated

7189.76 --> 7196.76
smoker's ventilation

7191.92 --> 7196.76
that's it it's not that difficult

7223.84 --> 7226.84
hey

7237.76 --> 7244.8
right anyway

7240.8 --> 7244.8
oh yeah i've been going for two hours

7246.56 --> 7251.04
i don't feel super super chatty but that

7248.88 --> 7252.639
might be because of yeah

7251.04 --> 7255.639
because i also went on jim bob's

7252.639 --> 7255.639
yesterday

7256.639 --> 7260.719
so i didn't get a lot of dream walking

7258.96 --> 7262.4
right because normally in the evening i

7260.719 --> 7264.639
dream walk that's like building up

7262.4 --> 7268.08
tension the tension's gonna gonna stay

7264.639 --> 7270.88
there and then when i do my show

7268.08 --> 7273.599
spark and in enrolls

7270.88 --> 7275.599
now i was i'm basically still like just

7273.599 --> 7278.0
thinking about how my show went

7275.599 --> 7280.0
yesterday and evening

7278.0 --> 7283.84
so do check it out it is like an hour

7280.0 --> 7283.84
show and there was a plenty set

7284.47 --> 7287.579000000001
[Music]

7292.32 --> 7297.239
what are you doing slo-mo moon buggy

7314.159 --> 7320.679
it should have made it against a lot to

7316.08 --> 7320.679
put additives to syria yeah no [ __ ]

7324.719 --> 7332.56
now my theory is is that big tobacco

7328.56 --> 7335.360000000001
actually attacked tobacco

7332.56 --> 7337.52
by putting the [ __ ] in there that got

7335.36 --> 7340.4
everybody sick then gave it a bad name

7337.52 --> 7344.080000000001
and then it's like oh no more tobacco

7340.4 --> 7346.32
our products don't cause cancer

7344.08 --> 7348.96
which is probably

7346.32 --> 7350.88
yeah i mean the tobacco in my opinion

7348.96 --> 7352.639
doesn't really do that unless you're

7350.88 --> 7354.639
like constantly smoking and you're

7352.639 --> 7356.32
smoking with the bad spirit

7354.639 --> 7358.08
for escapism yeah you're gonna get

7356.32 --> 7361.119
something

7358.08 --> 7364.4
but is there crap that really cause

7361.119 --> 7367.44
like this burden on the system

7364.4 --> 7369.92
medical issues from their specific

7367.44 --> 7374.08
product not from general tobacco that

7369.92 --> 7374.08
people could make in their own backyard

7379.36 --> 7385.44
so it just feels like they were there

7381.52 --> 7385.4400000000005
actually to ruin the tobacco

7386.719 --> 7390.4800000000005
like

7388.239 --> 7392.959999999999
just poisoning it and then giving it a

7390.48 --> 7395.199
bad name so that nobody is allowed to do

7392.96 --> 7396.88
anything with tobacco except for the big

7395.199 --> 7400.0
corporations

7396.88 --> 7403.84
big tobacco which can pay the fines in

7400.0 --> 7406.0
order to basically keep it illegal

7403.84 --> 7407.679
sort of

7406.0 --> 7409.04
so that they are the only ones that

7407.679 --> 7412.719
still have

7409.04 --> 7412.719
the product left to sell

7414.8 --> 7419.92
right because when big tobacco

7417.52 --> 7423.56
was supposedly

7419.92 --> 7423.56
yeah getting cornered

7423.84 --> 7429.76
what has it even has that even really

7426.159 --> 7432.32
happened or is it just ceremonial

7429.76 --> 7432.320000000001
i don't know

7432.48 --> 7435.678999999999
but

7434.239 --> 7437.5199999999995
yeah

7435.679 --> 7439.119
what should have happened is that dick

7437.52 --> 7440.639
tobacco would have been addressed like

7439.119 --> 7444.079
yeah you're putting [ __ ] in your

7440.639 --> 7446.8
products and it's causing medical issues

7444.079 --> 7448.4
we're gonna find you for that

7446.8 --> 7450.320000000001
right

7448.4 --> 7453.199
and then people should have been like

7450.32 --> 7455.44
what they put [ __ ] in there

7453.199 --> 7458.0
maybe i should just

7455.44 --> 7460.4
get my own tobacco leaves

7458.0 --> 7462.8
or like i'll import from a grower

7460.4 --> 7464.239
directly

7462.8 --> 7466.159000000001
that should have happened that should

7464.239 --> 7468.879999999999
have been popularized but that never

7466.159 --> 7468.879999999999
really happened

7469.599 --> 7474.8
i mean it's out there

7471.679 --> 7478.2390000000005
but it's not like the common thing

7474.8 --> 7481.28
people still just buy big tobacco [ __ ]

7478.239 --> 7483.44
in the store with extreme overprices and

7481.28 --> 7486.759999999999
still crap in there

7483.44 --> 7486.759999999999
as a standard

7498.719 --> 7504.88
you vape now says it's harmful to yeah

7501.679 --> 7504.88
it's a different hazards

7504.96 --> 7510.92
i don't like well i don't know i have

7507.04 --> 7510.92
never really done that

7527.04 --> 7532.76
oh okay so that won't bug you yeah

7529.52 --> 7532.76
no problem

7537.84 --> 7544.119000000001
popcorn loves what

7540.56 --> 7544.119000000001
are you talking about

7573.28 --> 7577.8
oh okay akuma virus

7583.36 --> 7588.0
oh it's insane how i just open a topic

7586.239 --> 7589.28
like a puzzle box and start putting it

7588.0 --> 7593.199
together i mean

7589.28 --> 7594.4
yeah i guess it's what i do

7593.199 --> 7596.719
instant

7594.4 --> 7598.96
right because that's that's how that's

7596.719 --> 7600.4800000000005
the only way you can get anywhere in

7598.96 --> 7601.599
this world

7600.48 --> 7603.839999999999
is

7601.599 --> 7607.360000000001
you just have to like oh we're moving oh

7603.84 --> 7609.76
okay what are you on about now okay

7607.36 --> 7611.28
everything i got let's just open this

7609.76 --> 7612.88
puzzle box yeah yeah this is a good

7611.28 --> 7614.639
comparison by the way

7612.88 --> 7616.2390000000005
because it does feel like a puzzle box

7614.639 --> 7619.36
it's like

7616.239 --> 7622.959999999999
what is this new scenario energies

7619.36 --> 7622.96
attentions click click click

7625.04 --> 7627.92
this is what i got

7628.8 --> 7631.8
right

7636.159 --> 7642.879999999999
but also there's just a lot of bigger

7638.88 --> 7644.56
issues like general problems historical

7642.88 --> 7646.400000000001
some time has passed a lot of

7644.56 --> 7648.639
information has been gathered

7646.4 --> 7650.239
there's a lot of this around

7648.639 --> 7651.76
that i feel just

7650.239 --> 7654.239
i can

7651.76 --> 7656.400000000001
put together much more cohesively so

7654.239 --> 7658.32
that people have a better generalized

7656.4 --> 7660.799999999999
understanding

7658.32 --> 7662.799999999999
from which they can take

7660.8 --> 7667.4400000000005
better choices

7662.8 --> 7671.119000000001
wiser oversight to not get carried away

7667.44 --> 7671.119
by the universal jargons

7671.199 --> 7675.919999999999
and get caught up in in the fray of the

7674.159 --> 7677.199
beast

7675.92 --> 7680.0
and it's

7677.199 --> 7680.0
in its narrative

7687.52 --> 7692.280000000001
nicotine salt what

7704.4 --> 7709.28
what

7705.52 --> 7710.96
you vape you can go without nicotine now

7709.28 --> 7712.88
uh

7710.96 --> 7717.4800000000005
but isn't vape

7712.88 --> 7717.4800000000005
doesn't that have nicotine akumavirus

7734.159 --> 7737.199
oh okay

7735.28 --> 7738.5599999999995
all right i didn't know that there so

7737.199 --> 7741.5199999999995
there's yeah

7738.56 --> 7742.639
it's basically vaping non-nicotine stuff

7741.52 --> 7745.639
okay

7742.639 --> 7745.639
fine

7755.599 --> 7762.0
yeah well i've never tried it i mean

7759.599 --> 7764.2390000000005
i may have like dated one time with

7762.0 --> 7766.96
somebody it's just that

7764.239 --> 7770.919999999999
it's like cold isn't it it's like not

7766.96 --> 7770.92
hot it's really weird

7772.56 --> 7776.96
i just thought it was really weird the

7774.719 --> 7778.56
time i tried it

7776.96 --> 7780.96
because it's just like

7778.56 --> 7782.8
what i can't barely feel like i even

7780.96 --> 7784.96
inhaled anything and then when i breathe

7782.8 --> 7790.119000000001
out it turns out to be a whole damn lot

7784.96 --> 7790.119
and i'm kind of like freaked out by that

7805.199 --> 7809.36
yeah yeah no yes slow mo moon bug i've

7808.0 --> 7810.639
been a

7809.36 --> 7813.5199999999995
fervent

7810.639 --> 7814.8
clove cigarette smoker myself yeah i

7813.52 --> 7817.360000000001
love that [ __ ]

7814.8 --> 7818.639
in the time when i didn't smoke cannabis

7817.36 --> 7822.88
at all

7818.639 --> 7822.88
i smoked those things a lot

7823.119 --> 7827.839999999999
like one of my favorite pastimes back

7825.199 --> 7830.079
then was driving in my car which i still

7827.84 --> 7833.1990000000005
had

7830.079 --> 7835.5199999999995
and then like play metal

7833.199 --> 7837.759999999999
usually the ones that i like

7835.52 --> 7840.4800000000005
or like even really hard stuff and then

7837.76 --> 7843.599
just smoke while driving

7840.48 --> 7845.28
preferably fast

7843.599 --> 7848.079
that was yeah

7845.28 --> 7849.92
not the most sensible habit but i love

7848.079 --> 7851.84
doing that

7849.92 --> 7856.32
just

7851.84 --> 7858.56
drive out there on some country road

7856.32 --> 7862.04
i'm just smoking clothes

7858.56 --> 7862.04
love that [ __ ]

7881.679 --> 7885.84
yeah yeah that's right that's what it's

7882.96 --> 7885.84
called

7886.159 --> 7890.5599999999995
with the

7887.44 --> 7894.079
with the red and black and the gold line

7890.56 --> 7896.4800000000005
on there remember that

7894.079 --> 7896.48
i do

7910.4 --> 7914.638999999999
yeah but those were the olden days also

7912.48 --> 7916.32
the days where i absolutely never had to

7914.639 --> 7920.0
worry about money because i was still

7916.32 --> 7922.239
sitting on the pile of inheritance money

7920.0 --> 7924.56
not properly

7922.239 --> 7926.799999999999
preventing it from depleting

7924.56 --> 7928.56
not rushing through it either but it was

7926.8 --> 7931.56
that time was a very different time for

7928.56 --> 7931.56
me

7940.239 --> 7943.239
uh

7957.04 --> 7961.76
don't see many old men with pipes these

7959.119 --> 7966.28
days are younger but i got one

7961.76 --> 7966.280000000001
i don't really use it as a standard

7970.56 --> 7975.04
originally i'm not even joking i

7972.639 --> 7977.599
originally got this for like a larping

7975.04 --> 7977.599
character

7977.679 --> 7983.2390000000005
but yeah i got one it's a really good

7979.679 --> 7983.2390000000005
one too so

7984.639 --> 7989.95
it still smells like cloves

7986.7 --> 7989.95
[Music]

7992.32 --> 7996.5199999999995
well i'm gonna clean it though

8002.56 --> 8007.639
you got a pipe or two nut for yeah sure

8004.48 --> 8007.638999999999
you do

8017.84 --> 8022.88
tobacco pipes almost gone

8020.96 --> 8025.84
well it would be kind of funny if they

8022.88 --> 8025.84
just made

8026.8 --> 8031.119000000001
like vape pipes

8029.199 --> 8034.32
that it just looks like an old tobacco

8031.119 --> 8037.799999999999
pipe but it's actually a vapor

8034.32 --> 8037.799999999999
that would be hilarious

8038.56 --> 8044.719
it would be like a larp pipe

8041.84 --> 8047.76
but that's actually a vape machine

8044.719 --> 8050.4800000000005
so that like if you used it then like a

8047.76 --> 8052.639
light would burn inside of it

8050.48 --> 8054.638999999999
not literally burn but just

8052.639 --> 8056.96
light up so it would seem like

8054.639 --> 8059.04
something's coming out of there

8056.96 --> 8060.4
and then you just inhale the

8059.04 --> 8064.84
the vape

8060.4 --> 8064.839999999999
that's wouldn't that just be fun

8071.44 --> 8073.678999999999
right

8074.96 --> 8079.36
i mean you're like hip and hip at the

8077.76 --> 8081.599
same time

8079.36 --> 8085.36
like oh look at my old pipe was actually

8081.599 --> 8088.4800000000005
a really new vape machine

8085.36 --> 8091.199
you're so trendy now

8088.48 --> 8097.119
i i might have just broken up or broken

8091.199 --> 8097.119
open an entire new market but we'll see

8104.239 --> 8109.839999999999

8113.36 --> 8117.5199999999995

8133.119 --> 8138.32
glass pipe are you sure that wasn't

8135.28 --> 8141.36

8138.32 --> 8141.36
he just gave to you

8142.96 --> 8145.96
yes

8151.119 --> 8156.119
yeah george sanford was thinking the

8152.8 --> 8156.119000000001
same thing

8165.04 --> 8168.04
uh

8181.07 --> 8184.34
[Music]

it was so silly
