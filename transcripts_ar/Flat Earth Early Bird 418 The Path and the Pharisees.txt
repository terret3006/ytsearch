88.67 --> 95.9
cloudy and rainy not really hard raining

92.27 --> 101.28999999999999
but it's just constantly dripping around

95.9 --> 101.29
and not really that cold though

102.369 --> 105.42
but yeah

106.27 --> 111.00999999999999
not the most appealing types of weather

111.31 --> 117.19
so yeah today just got green tea with me

118.21 --> 123.729
and that's it so let's go through jack

127.5 --> 130.689
[Music]

132.7 --> 143.959
so a GM was first Jarno Garrett yes I am

139.01 --> 149.6
Dutch flatter spaceman Amanda you Ryan

143.959 --> 158.05
artherton mark marshall Julia Pavan Tom

149.6 --> 163.34
Parker stone monkey 3d Amanda young

158.05 --> 171.26000000000002
pumpkin yeah good to see you all it's

163.34 --> 175.28
Tuesday the 14th of January 2020 so yeah

171.26 --> 177.04899999999998
man yesterday was just so late it's it

175.28 --> 182.47
was just stupid Oh Chad frozen again

177.049 --> 182.47
thanks thanks for noticing quickly

184.24 --> 190.20000000000002
yeah yeah was getting weird I don't know

187.66 --> 190.2
what happened

195.709 --> 203.2
why did Kiwi take me to the Learning

198.56 --> 207.049
Tree because I think he my ideas

203.2 --> 210.73899999999998
threaten his his sense of authority or

207.049 --> 213.20000000000002
self-worth or whatever and and so he's

210.739 --> 216.5
just trying to put me back into the

213.2 --> 220.599
student chair even though I'm basically

216.5 --> 223.67
claiming equality that's what's going on

220.599 --> 228.25
so yeah sure he can do that I don't

223.67 --> 228.25
really care you know

232.209 --> 238.689
though his personal authority it is

234.939 --> 241.39
social hierarchy type thing and just

238.689 --> 244.299
John would just wants to be top dog but

241.39 --> 248.10899999999998
he doesn't actually want to have the

244.299 --> 259.75
social responsibility of being a top dog

248.109 --> 261.16
so it's just yeah you know but he's

259.75 --> 265.57
probably gonna be doing that kind of

261.16 --> 269.22900000000004
thing for a while Wow

265.57 --> 271.71
was that just a skip in the video that

269.229 --> 271.71
was odd

284.289 --> 293.68899999999996
right yeah I know Tom Parker facts or

288.259 --> 298.039
facts are facts but problem is is we are

293.689 --> 301.34000000000003
so used to people especially ballers

298.039 --> 304.31
just forwarding facts and then spinning

301.34 --> 309.88899999999995
their conclusion to it all their

304.31 --> 311.87
assertions and also from well some of

309.889 --> 315.77
the alternative Flat Earth is like

311.87 --> 318.59000000000003
people like an on right-hand myself yeah

315.77 --> 320.029
there especially in the past in the time

318.59 --> 321.65
when it still believe in gravity yeah

320.029 --> 324.5
just you start to follow certain

321.65 --> 327.10999999999996
patterns of explanation you start to

324.5 --> 329.539
point at certain facts and well as a

327.11 --> 331.90000000000003
result from a social perspective not

329.539 --> 334.789
from an argumentation perspective even

331.9 --> 339.25899999999996
people on the Flat Earth debate panel

334.789 --> 341.56899999999996
Nathan Huy myself sometimes I try not to

339.259 --> 343.699
do it we kind of like you have the

341.569 --> 346.509
tendency to preemptive strike the others

343.699 --> 348.8
argument because we already know exactly

346.509 --> 351.139
exactly in the tail where it's probably

348.8 --> 354.319
going even though sometimes that might

351.139 --> 354.71000000000004
not be correct and yet John does that a

354.319 --> 359.33000000000004
lot

354.71 --> 363.69899999999996
he doesn't easily let go even when when

359.33 --> 363.69899999999996
it turns out that he was wrong just

364.0 --> 372.379
can't let go of his original

366.11 --> 376.12
expectations as it were but yeah it's

372.379 --> 376.12
just social complications

376.93 --> 385.96
you know I've done it myself especially

380.229 --> 388.57
when I'm like really riled up and hey in

385.96 --> 394.38
a heated argument it can't really work

388.57 --> 396.84999999999997
out well but it's all about the timing

394.38 --> 399.86
you can't just do that [ __ ] out all the

396.85 --> 402.889
time doesn't work anymore after a while

399.86 --> 402.889
[Music]

414.44 --> 425.83
all right Tom Parker well what is frozen

420.02 --> 425.83
again that's not

438.01 --> 441.19
[Music]

442.469 --> 454.319
there's just a slight delay in it yet so

445.08 --> 456.05899999999997
I was like that oh right sure so yeah I

454.319 --> 458.279
got my list here of things that I

456.059 --> 460.8
watched yesterday well first off of

458.279 --> 466.319
course get my early bird show Flat Earth

460.8 --> 469.789
debates then the after show I was really

466.319 --> 473.55
getting more and more active like pretty

469.789 --> 476.36899999999997
ridiculous listen back to the ever after

473.55 --> 478.069
show and man I would I literally never

476.369 --> 481.769
stopped talking

478.069 --> 483.53900000000004
in retrospect yeah I went too far to my

481.769 --> 485.849
own taste it's annoying I don't know I

483.539 --> 491.12899999999996
was just in a very very black blobby

485.849 --> 494.18899999999996
mood very very glad and that was kind of

491.129 --> 495.839
silly me telling tenth man it was kind

494.189 --> 500.009
of a joke though like please don't take

495.839 --> 503.55
too long but to be fair I just didn't

500.009 --> 507.509
really want a religious preach like I

503.55 --> 509.61
didn't get it yeah because he was

507.509 --> 511.759
presuming that I didn't get it

509.61 --> 515.789
concerning the Bible and how things work

511.759 --> 517.409
that it's not about that for me so

515.789 --> 519.449
that's kind of why I said that

517.409 --> 521.88
and then after her this is not too far

519.449 --> 523.74
after I like did this super long-winded

521.88 --> 526.439
explanation so that was kind of

523.74 --> 529.41
embarrassing retrospect but oh well I

526.439 --> 534.029
had a really great time though you know

529.41 --> 536.639
I really go loose on the ever after show

534.029 --> 539.85
I always kind of have and even now that

536.639 --> 543.0790000000001
is recording I'm like yeah I don't know

539.85 --> 543.0790000000001
it's it's just what it is

545.9 --> 549.3
I guess it's just me and a less official

548.21 --> 552.36
capacity

549.3 --> 552.3599999999999
[Music]

554.56 --> 557.68
[Music]

559.07 --> 562.75
hello by the way Nathan Oakley

568.83 --> 572.269
and Sandra woods

575.73 --> 583.049
yeah oh by the way I'm under you I hoped

578.069 --> 585.419
you liked my little shout out on the

583.049 --> 588.679
ever after show you were there by the

585.419 --> 588.679
way I saw you and Jett

592.17 --> 595.74
no James Mason

597.83 --> 604.35
right so anyway

600.9 --> 610.74
early bird virus debate happy-ever-after

604.35 --> 613.02
show which went on pretty long very long

610.74 --> 615.72
really

613.02 --> 619.92
then leb went live that was kind of fun

615.72 --> 623.07
hanging around back for chatting oh yeah

619.92 --> 627.3
then Owen Benjamin went live on D life

623.07 --> 631.2
like the morning show and it was pretty

627.3 --> 634.8599999999999
it was cool right after that

631.2 --> 637.6500000000001
do y'all Glee jus just hung around for a

634.86 --> 641.52
bit not too long oh yeah also in between

637.65 --> 644.5799999999999
somewhere I was yeah I misplaced it it

641.52 --> 647.1899999999999
was before Owen Benjamin I stepped over

644.58 --> 651.7700000000001
to watch the Alex Jones Show for a bit

647.19 --> 655.23
and I was like what the [ __ ] is this

651.77 --> 658.47
it's like the entire day on the

655.23 --> 660.45
background Alex had like volcanoes

658.47 --> 663.72
erupting and it was like the theme of

660.45 --> 665.7
the day very funny in a way because yeah

663.72 --> 667.2900000000001
I I kind of brought it up during the

665.7 --> 670.13
Flat Earth debates we had a pretty

667.29 --> 673.7099999999999
elaborate topic about it about volcanoes

670.13 --> 676.56
tectonic plates shifting guess what Alex

673.71 --> 682.02
was explaining it oh how it works and

676.56 --> 687.4499999999999
how because of the Sun the gravity blah

682.02 --> 689.28
so he gave his weirdo improvised some

687.45 --> 693.69
what something some of the things not

689.28 --> 696.39
improvised relating to older you know

693.69 --> 698.97
Sentra crowded research though but his

696.39 --> 702.24
explanation as to why all these volcano

698.97 --> 705.75
eruptions blah blah blah and then went

702.24 --> 708.3
off into a cultist talkin even the other

705.75 --> 711.12
dimension drawing that in there again

708.3 --> 714.0899999999999
and all that is it's like such a it was

711.12 --> 716.19
like the Joe Rogan podcast thing but

714.09 --> 721.98
even more compacted with lots of fear

716.19 --> 725.19
porn in there and just very noisy it's

721.98 --> 726.9
like yeah overall I really didn't think

725.19 --> 730.0500000000001
even think it was that interesting but

726.9 --> 733.79
it it was just remarkably noisy

730.05 --> 738.209
so I thought it was not worthy at it

733.79 --> 741.179
right anyway and then just hung around

738.209 --> 746.0999999999999
here and there oh yeah

741.179 --> 748.91
played it played a new game yeah playing

746.1 --> 751.35
this new it's another free-to-play game

748.91 --> 752.879
turn-based straight it's really basic

751.35 --> 754.47
but yeah it's good to play new game

752.879 --> 757.1
although I don't know how long I'm going

754.47 --> 760.799
to be playing this but it's kind of fun

757.1 --> 763.1700000000001
it's nothing special then yeah then I as

760.799 --> 764.939
I wanted to go to bed guess what happens

763.17 --> 767.9989999999999
your own Benjamin went live with the

764.939 --> 769.17
second D life hangout and that one was

767.999 --> 771.989
really good

769.17 --> 772.79
my god he was like so much so much

771.989 --> 778.35
energy

772.79 --> 781.829
piano constantly and Wow so I couldn't

778.35 --> 787.9200000000001
step away thus ended up staying up until

781.829 --> 793.769
like five o'clock was crazy but that was

787.92 --> 795.66
really good stuff and yeah it was funny

793.769 --> 799.589
because I think that he may have seen

795.66 --> 802.11
like Alex Jones as well because he was

799.589 --> 805.3190000000001
on about how ridiculous Alex Jones

802.11 --> 807.839
really has become that is such a cartoon

805.319 --> 809.8789999999999
of what he used to be and that for all

807.839 --> 813.1990000000001
the useful information he sometimes in

809.879 --> 817.16
put puts in there is so much political

813.199 --> 820.92
political manipulation from his side and

817.16 --> 822.929
at the same time so much fear part and

820.92 --> 826.079
heliocentric nonsense inserted there

822.929 --> 829.98
it's just the good stuff is becoming

826.079 --> 832.3499999999999
kind of hard to find oh yes by the way I

829.98 --> 834.1990000000001
almost forgot Thank You Amanda young for

832.35 --> 837.929
the five dollar super chat donation

834.199 --> 840.4799999999999
thank you so much she says thanks a lot

837.929 --> 843.509
are we now really Prius appreciate that

840.48 --> 845.759
from the heart yeah yeah about the shout

843.509 --> 849.019
out on the happy after after show yeah

845.759 --> 849.019
sure you know

850.42 --> 857.5
I can't personally compare the imagine

855.67 --> 859.5699999999999
something being worse in a real-life

857.5 --> 862.3
situation than being mother and having a

859.57 --> 866.5600000000001
kid and then being threatened by some

862.3 --> 874.3299999999999
maniac so yeah definitely deserve the

866.56 --> 882.6099999999999
help yeah I hope you get out of this

874.33 --> 886.98
unscathed our space man what really

882.61 --> 890.83
youth everything that I just said about

886.98 --> 892.33
about Alex Jones you think that that is

890.83 --> 895.0200000000001
applicable to Owen

892.33 --> 895.0200000000001
really

898.77 --> 903.23
I don't think so at all

910.259 --> 916.42
except what what do you think that his

912.819 --> 919.649
other things that he does are political

916.42 --> 924.3389999999999
have you even paid close attention

919.649 --> 928.509
because he attacks everything everything

924.339 --> 930.7900000000001
that is just like obviously going wrong

928.509 --> 937.179
or corrupting or being sneaky in some

930.79 --> 941.41
way but he's very genuine and he has

937.179 --> 946.54
some clear vision before except I just

941.41 --> 949.079
really like his ideas about Islam that's

946.54 --> 951.579
kind of how I see it as well it's like

949.079 --> 955.269
yeah it's just this other way of living

951.579 --> 957.3389999999999
and you could definitely consider it to

955.269 --> 959.17
be about the same God even though the

957.339 --> 961.149
technicals behind it and everything

959.17 --> 965.8
that's written yeah but that's basically

961.149 --> 967.48
what was written by the men and yeah

965.8 --> 968.17
just like with the Bible and the

967.48 --> 970.99
Catholic Church

968.17 --> 975.49
there's just the grab ler groups the

970.99 --> 978.16
Pharisees and they yeah they put war in

975.49 --> 980.319
there and they put everyone against one

978.16 --> 983.259
another they rewrite things so that

980.319 --> 985.36
groups could technically no longer get

983.259 --> 989.619
along together because they contradict

985.36 --> 993.79
one another that kind of thing but the

989.619 --> 996.3090000000001
baseline of just general Muslims you

993.79 --> 999.389
know no they're they're pretty decent

996.309 --> 999.389
people are different

999.91 --> 1006.639
but yeah all that mmm

1003.67 --> 1011.529
yeah that Isis maniac stuff and jihad

1006.639 --> 1014.259
that's really not what it's about

1011.529 --> 1016.93
not really but the problem is it's still

1014.259 --> 1019.75
a predominant thing and it's being used

1016.93 --> 1024.97
and abused by politics all over the

1019.75 --> 1028.65
place it's basically the you could call

1024.97 --> 1028.65
it the Islam straw man

1032.22 --> 1037.92
and there's so much being even now

1034.77 --> 1039.75
concerning like Iran in the situation

1037.92 --> 1048.75
there's just so much spinning going

1039.75 --> 1050.31
around because yeah it there's a

1048.75 --> 1051.93
religious debate for those that don't

1050.31 --> 1055.22
know about this I'm just gonna give it

1051.93 --> 1057.69
out the real basics you know Rhys

1055.22 --> 1059.34
probably knows a lot more about this

1057.69 --> 1062.31
than me because he's really studied up

1059.34 --> 1064.1999999999998
on on the Koran I haven't even read it

1062.31 --> 1065.6699999999998
really but I've heard just a lot about

1064.2 --> 1067.8600000000001
it and looked into it

1065.67 --> 1070.44
preliminary and I don't know be

1067.86 --> 1072.3899999999999
confronted with it for a while got some

1070.44 --> 1074.6100000000001
time to make up my mind and I had been

1072.39 --> 1080.16
fooled for a long time as well I really

1074.61 --> 1083.1299999999999
thought oh it's evil but no that's if it

1080.16 --> 1086.52
is evil then Christianity is evil as

1083.13 --> 1089.4
well could just rough it if you're going

1086.52 --> 1091.44
to put it like that then that's what

1089.4 --> 1095.49
attacking what it comes down to so I'm

1091.44 --> 1099.3600000000001
not gonna go there yeah Jesus is the

1095.49 --> 1104.01
truth definitely but it it's a at the

1099.36 --> 1107.1899999999998
same time also a principle and hey did

1104.01 --> 1109.43
you know that Islam actually respects

1107.19 --> 1112.92
Jesus Christ

1109.43 --> 1114.69
officially yeah and then you have the

1112.92 --> 1116.5800000000002
Pharisees in yeah they kill Christians

1114.69 --> 1118.29
but to kill Muslims as well it's all

1116.58 --> 1119.4199999999998
just power to them they don't give a

1118.29 --> 1124.52
[ __ ]

1119.42 --> 1124.52
see that's not Islam

1131.7 --> 1138.99
but Islam that's not the way of the

1135.27 --> 1140.79
Quran it's really tough you know with

1138.99 --> 1144.18
the names even to this day because it's

1140.79 --> 1147.6599999999999
all but John just been so gravel it's

1144.18 --> 1150.3300000000002
been so such subjective Pharisee and

1147.66 --> 1167.8100000000002
politics politicized Islam that's not a

1150.33 --> 1167.81
good thing so right well

1171.54 --> 1178.95
really they don't think he's a prophet

1173.93 --> 1182.88
no I I think they do actually Mike or

1178.95 --> 1185.28
are they just don't think he is the

1182.88 --> 1188.8500000000001
creator incarnate in a way that's the

1185.28 --> 1191.76
only difference but I did think he's a

1188.85 --> 1197.52
prophet pretty sure they do regard him

1191.76 --> 1199.14
as such right Hanna koala I guess you

1197.52 --> 1203.31
could say that Muslims are cool but

1199.14 --> 1207.24
Islam is evil but yeah it's it's so

1203.31 --> 1210.09
tough you know what is what it I don't

1207.24 --> 1214.59
think it's all the same it's it's almost

1210.09 --> 1217.9499999999998
like the small hat grapplers and did you

1214.59 --> 1220.11
had the wider Jewish world and then the

1217.95 --> 1223.1100000000001
polettis I see it's kind of the same

1220.11 --> 1228.27
mechanism see how the works it's yeah

1223.11 --> 1230.6699999999998
what the problems Jews have in general

1228.27 --> 1234.36
choose I think are just pretty decent

1230.67 --> 1236.6100000000001
and interesting people have they have

1234.36 --> 1239.4199999999998
the gravelled version of their religion

1236.61 --> 1244.35
that just constantly uses them as a

1239.42 --> 1246.8100000000002
straw man and I think that Islam and in

1244.35 --> 1249.98
the the Muslim world is that's kind of

1246.81 --> 1249.98
the same system in a way

1268.03 --> 1282.79
that okay ESP power 717 dreams we know

1277.59 --> 1286.75
somebody somebody getting getting a bit

1282.79 --> 1289.72
intolerant here I don't know I don't

1286.75 --> 1298.69
think I said anything wrong and hey I am

1289.72 --> 1302.05
a Christian okay so I am going with the

1298.69 --> 1304.18
rough baseline give the key of the

1302.05 --> 1307.99
entire Christianity like he died for our

1304.18 --> 1311.3500000000001
sins he doesn't matter to me whether you

1307.99 --> 1315.55
take it literal or metaphorically it is

1311.35 --> 1317.62
critical or ethereal I kind of I'm kind

1315.55 --> 1318.9099999999999
of an ethereal Christian in many ways

1317.62 --> 1321.28
doesn't mean that I don't think that

1318.91 --> 1323.53
nothing about it ever happened but I'm I

1321.28 --> 1326.92
really drowned myself more in the

1323.53 --> 1334.1399999999999
ethereal approach rather than yeah the

1326.92 --> 1337.78
esoteric approach that Christ came to

1334.14 --> 1343.0600000000002
yet to change the Covenant to finalize

1337.78 --> 1344.62
the the creations plan in a way so yeah

1343.06 --> 1346.24
I did I'm definitely a Christian but

1344.62 --> 1348.76
that doesn't mean that everything else

1346.24 --> 1350.91
should all be destroyed or that [ __ ] or

1348.76 --> 1353.98
that it's always gonna be evil you know

1350.91 --> 1356.5500000000002
every group of humans

1353.98 --> 1360.19
whatever idea they come up with whatever

1356.55 --> 1362.8899999999999
love they insert into it and their

1360.19 --> 1365.14
creativity and their soul there's always

1362.89 --> 1367.93
gonna be other people then at some point

1365.14 --> 1370.74
grab lers that are gonna say oh that's

1367.93 --> 1374.44
interesting I could just bend this stuff

1370.74 --> 1376.24
into a control mechanism to control

1374.44 --> 1379.5700000000002
these people and then make them do

1376.24 --> 1381.85
things that they normally wouldn't do go

1379.57 --> 1384.36
to war or something yeah that's what

1381.85 --> 1387.6299999999999
happens it happens with everything

1384.36 --> 1387.6299999999999
almost everything

1398.91 --> 1406.52
right yeah and I believe that the path

1402.57 --> 1415.08
of Christ and his ways are a unique

1406.52 --> 1419.82
esoteric ethereal code a a great example

1415.08 --> 1422.48
that is oh yeah that is potentially I

1419.82 --> 1425.1299999999999
didn't have to prove it but it feels

1422.48 --> 1427.23
infallible and it just the empirical

1425.13 --> 1429.24
results from trying to do your best to

1427.23 --> 1430.95
do it oh and with with very much with

1429.24 --> 1433.47
the consciousness and the spirit and so

1430.95 --> 1437.76
all if you really dedicate there's so

1433.47 --> 1441.66
much it gives that God gives to you as

1437.76 --> 1449.49
they say if you just go with logos so

1441.66 --> 1453.6200000000001
that is absolutely I go by that but yeah

1449.49 --> 1460.29
I'm not really so much concerned by the

1453.62 --> 1465.2399999999998
verbal or written rules in a book those

1460.29 --> 1467.46
rules only really matter when it matters

1465.24 --> 1472.14
when it actually met because there is

1467.46 --> 1474.8700000000001
human insert or a temporary view at some

1472.14 --> 1479.0400000000002
points as well it's all yeah you can get

1474.87 --> 1481.7299999999998
lost in these types of books start

1479.04 --> 1481.73
cherry-picking

1488.78 --> 1491.96
[Music]

1493.49 --> 1502.86
logos the Word of God it is the the

1498.809 --> 1506.1299999999999
essence the essence of our purpose of

1502.86 --> 1508.9799999999998
being here the mechanisms designed

1506.13 --> 1516.72
within us if you fulfill them if you

1508.98 --> 1520.679
fulfill the design that is logos and one

1516.72 --> 1522.3890000000001
of the best ways to achieve it is by

1520.679 --> 1526.679
whatever you're going to be doing in the

1522.389 --> 1532.1689999999999
world try to keep the spirit on the path

1526.679 --> 1536.96
in yeah in a purity way but spiritually

1532.169 --> 1539.49
mostly and just make wise decisions and

1536.96 --> 1543.179
know that everything you do has

1539.49 --> 1549.33
consequences and that you will always

1543.179 --> 1551.6100000000001
have to do something at least and that

1549.33 --> 1553.3799999999999
even if you do nothing it will have

1551.61 --> 1556.799
consequences so you always have to

1553.38 --> 1560.7600000000002
choose and that awareness also is for me

1556.799 --> 1565.08
personally very important it is the

1560.76 --> 1568.1
honesty about what is real and that you

1565.08 --> 1571.61
can't fool yourself in thinking that you

1568.1 --> 1571.61
don't have a choice

1584.539 --> 1590.679
now logos I derived from the word I

1591.729 --> 1598.07
think look I haven't even done any

1596.059 --> 1601.609
background research on the word it's

1598.07 --> 1604.039
just something that slip in there some

1601.609 --> 1606.379
people started using it especially Owen

1604.039 --> 1608.419
Benjamin and it really caught on with me

1606.379 --> 1611.4689999999998
and they get the feel for it so I think

1608.419 --> 1611.469
I kind of got it right

1618.01 --> 1623.079
yeah

1619.97 --> 1623.079
[Music]

1628.36 --> 1631.55
[Music]

1639.18 --> 1643.6000000000001
all right well there's bound to be

1641.8 --> 1648.57
different types of books out there that

1643.6 --> 1648.57
may interpret the word in the wrong way

1654.41 --> 1658.5990000000002
[Music]

1667.14 --> 1671.98
right

1668.98 --> 1671.98
well

1672.66 --> 1682.91
maybe all right I'm not gonna respond to

1679.14 --> 1682.91
that thank you

1703.48 --> 1706.23
right

1716.029 --> 1720.799
yeah it's the same wetter over here

1718.2 --> 1720.799
Martin Ellen

1731.25 --> 1736.62
it's not really a hard raining but it's

1733.62 --> 1751.2299999999998
just cloudy and just dripping all over

1736.62 --> 1753.2099999999998
the place is dreary oh well Wow look at

1751.23 --> 1755.809
the votes look at the votes in the show

1753.21 --> 1755.809
is crazy

1761.04 --> 1768.99
all right there's some new uploads

1763.02 --> 1773.16
thanks guys and gals anyway yeah

1768.99 --> 1778.44
anything else you any of you want to

1773.16 --> 1780.8700000000001
start talking about more logos or maybe

1778.44 --> 1787.47
some details in the Flat Earth debate or

1780.87 --> 1790.34
how about the whole light issue because

1787.47 --> 1790.34
it is such an issue

1798.55 --> 1807.1
the particle wave duality false

1802.57 --> 1812.4289999999999
dichotomy because it's definitely not a

1807.1 --> 1817.4399999999998
wave but it doesn't really seem like

1812.429 --> 1820.0590000000002
what what is defined as particle either

1817.44 --> 1825.79
but you could call it but you can think

1820.059 --> 1827.62
of it as a particle you know but if you

1825.79 --> 1832.48
just say energy quanta that is

1827.62 --> 1837.9099999999999
technically correct it's just that if

1832.48 --> 1841.21
you assume that it is a unit and it

1837.91 --> 1843.8500000000001
can't be any smaller than that then you

1841.21 --> 1846.16
got a technical mistake that you really

1843.85 --> 1849.37
can't account for if you think about it

1846.16 --> 1851.8000000000002
very carefully and it tried to explain

1849.37 --> 1856.4499999999998
it's so difficult to explain you know

1851.8 --> 1858.82
even to people understand that but I

1856.45 --> 1863.71
tried before like if it's particles then

1858.82 --> 1865.45
how can yeah I can potentially things be

1863.71 --> 1867.6100000000001
visible for from such a long distance

1865.45 --> 1872.73
how can things come how can light

1867.61 --> 1875.61
compact when it basically has to merge

1872.73 --> 1879.97
how can there be an average of

1875.61 --> 1883.75
everything how can things blare up the

1879.97 --> 1885.52
souping up color of an ad that can that

1883.75 --> 1887.88
doesn't make any sense with particles

1885.52 --> 1891.79
really to me

1887.88 --> 1895.5100000000002
so are these particles then kind of like

1891.79 --> 1898.03
merge over time and they mix up and see

1895.51 --> 1899.98
it it's really tough when you think

1898.03 --> 1903.01
about it it just seems so much more

1899.98 --> 1905.95
likely it's all just beams infinitely

1903.01 --> 1908.8
divisible beams and they split up and

1905.95 --> 1911.53
they can go parallel to one another if

1908.8 --> 1913.78
an even overlap it doesn't really matter

1911.53 --> 1918.04
it's just an amount of energy and it

1913.78 --> 1922.84
just manifests and there is no minimum

1918.04 --> 1925.8999999999999
amount and then yeah spectra splitting

1922.84 --> 1928.3
up compacting all that makes so much

1925.9 --> 1929.68
more sense so much more sense if you

1928.3 --> 1939.73
really really

1929.68 --> 1943.41
think about it could you imagine that

1939.73 --> 1946.81
for example computer ray-tracing

1943.41 --> 1950.65
would instead of literal vectors and all

1946.81 --> 1955.44
that like points exact angles it would

1950.65 --> 1958.21
use presumed sized particles instead

1955.44 --> 1963.5800000000002
particle tracing yeah nothing would work

1958.21 --> 1965.8600000000001
no it's because it is a beam and it can

1963.58 --> 1968.31
technically split up indefinitely even

1965.86 --> 1970.81
with input you could presume in all that

1968.31 --> 1975.22
but yeah what you get to see is going to

1970.81 --> 1978.82
be the average down visibles based on

1975.22 --> 1982.33
the resolution but if it was all

1978.82 --> 1984.55
particles then the yeah at some point

1982.33 --> 1987.28
you wouldn't be able to do that and no

1984.55 --> 1990.28
because ray tracing is kind of vector

1987.28 --> 1994.92
based it doesn't have it's not size

1990.28 --> 1994.92
bound and that's why it works

2004.26 --> 2009.12
right hey and I'm not saying look people

2007.5 --> 2011.34
like right to hand and everyone they go

2009.12 --> 2015.09
very they go much further than they say

2011.34 --> 2017.1299999999999
oh no like molecular and atomic theory

2015.09 --> 2019.32
is not correct they are not minimum

2017.13 --> 2023.0100000000002
units either and I'm not going even that

2019.32 --> 2029.1499999999999
for I'm pretty confident at this point

2023.01 --> 2033.09
at least that ya matter does have

2029.15 --> 2036.27
indivisible units at the base of it all

2033.09 --> 2038.1899999999998
and I've seen some empirical feedback

2036.27 --> 2040.74
from that based on the electron

2038.19 --> 2042.69
microscope well so although it's still a

2040.74 --> 2047.73
model like representation but it does

2042.69 --> 2052.649
give some very interesting views so yeah

2047.73 --> 2057.02
it is still it's not in yeah indeed how

2052.649 --> 2060.27
do you say finite or in definitive proof

2057.02 --> 2065.19
but I don't know for me it is

2060.27 --> 2068.57
satisfactory but yeah that doesn't mean

2065.19 --> 2072.98
that everything else light electricity

2068.57 --> 2076.619
or even like magnetic energy is that -

2072.98 --> 2078.33
it's just when we measure it measuring

2076.619 --> 2080.3990000000003
in itself is always going to be a

2078.33 --> 2083.2799999999997
material thing it's always based on

2080.399 --> 2088.02
matter in some way can measure things

2083.28 --> 2090.8
without matter right so yeah any

2088.02 --> 2093.27
measurement we do upon these types of

2090.8 --> 2096.27
non-physical elements are going to be

2093.27 --> 2102.0
bound by the physical minimum unit

2096.27 --> 2107.24
limitations so technically we would not

2102.0 --> 2110.28
be able to measure the minimum amount

2107.24 --> 2114.2099999999996
that light could be as a presumed

2110.28 --> 2116.9100000000003
particle or electricity even know we can

2114.21 --> 2120.2400000000002
only relay it by its interaction with

2116.91 --> 2124.23
matter and the critical mass switch

2120.24 --> 2127.47
effects when the energy quanta is enough

2124.23 --> 2131.16
in order for the atom or molecule to

2127.47 --> 2132.48
trigger the electrical effect or

2131.16 --> 2135.7999999999997
whatever it's going to be the absorption

2132.48 --> 2135.8
or right

2137.67 --> 2140.8
[Music]

2142.1 --> 2148.35
but on the other hand yet that doesn't

2144.93 --> 2151.2
mean that you cannot deduce a lot so

2148.35 --> 2153.36
what I just explained about light ray

2151.2 --> 2155.43
tracing and all that and one of the

2153.36 --> 2158.1
problems that would be if like was a

2155.43 --> 2161.1299999999997
minimum unit literally flying around or

2158.1 --> 2164.5499999999997
yeah a in the visible unit flying around

2161.13 --> 2166.59
like that compacting splitting up and

2164.55 --> 2169.65
all that it would be problematic so you

2166.59 --> 2171.75
can deduce that it is very unlikely to

2169.65 --> 2175.53
be a particle and is much more likely to

2171.75 --> 2178.23
be not a wave but beams that can be

2175.53 --> 2181.2900000000004
split up indefinitely it it makes things

2178.23 --> 2187.04
easier and even when we emulate it

2181.29 --> 2189.54
through ray tracing that becomes obvious

2187.04 --> 2191.87
but it is still all deduction based

2189.54 --> 2194.19
because you can't really measure it

2191.87 --> 2196.68
because with measurement actual

2194.19 --> 2199.08
measurement outside of modeling and

2196.68 --> 2204.8999999999996
emulation you're always going to be

2199.08 --> 2207.7799999999997
bound by matter yeah so that's that's my

2204.9 --> 2209.9900000000002
input on that subject for this time

2207.78 --> 2209.9900000000002
being

2212.05 --> 2215.34
what is this

2222.06 --> 2225.17
[Music]

2238.2 --> 2248.71
yeah thanks AGM I know you I didn't

2244.42 --> 2250.66
think you were talking about me like my

2248.71 --> 2254.02
pants are currently not that fancy

2250.66 --> 2258.67
there's yeah actually I have to go to

2254.02 --> 2260.53
the to the daylight to fix them so

2258.67 --> 2264.51
they're not really that fancy at the

2260.53 --> 2264.51
time being they used to be though

2288.89 --> 2293.089
ha that's funny you say that mark

2291.349 --> 2297.9700000000003
colored no well that's the same thing

2293.089 --> 2302.839
it's the same thing isn't it seeing and

2297.97 --> 2306.769
capra seeing it is the light interacting

2302.839 --> 2310.19
with material see so it's still bound by

2306.769 --> 2312.68
material so yeah of course you can't see

2310.19 --> 2321.13
small enough because you're still bound

2312.68 --> 2321.1299999999997
by the material for light registry

2327.23 --> 2330.429
[Music]

2333.58 --> 2345.14
yeah awesome so glad you get it more

2337.46 --> 2348.25
color because it's a tough one it takes

2345.14 --> 2348.25
some time getting used to

2351.64 --> 2358.239
[Music]

2374.63 --> 2389.049
Betty Sunday can you please just talk

2379.19 --> 2389.049
and not just post Bible references

2391.48 --> 2400.05
although I do not I do appreciate the

2396.19 --> 2400.05
content of them so far but

2406.77 --> 2409.909
[Music]

2416.05 --> 2423.75
all right I agree to York Sanford yet

2420.46 --> 2427.62
look nASA has done some technological

2423.75 --> 2430.69
development okay but it's mostly

2427.62 --> 2433.35
development it's not inventing things

2430.69 --> 2437.43
from scratch it's more of figuring

2433.35 --> 2442.11
better ways out to do certain industrial

2437.43 --> 2447.7
processes yes I'm pretty sure they have

2442.11 --> 2451.7400000000002
but they don't really invent this like

2447.7 --> 2451.74
new processes no

2457.59 --> 2461.78
did they invent the MRI machine

2468.29 --> 2478.0299999999997
all right I don't know if they did could

2475.88 --> 2478.03
be

2486.44 --> 2494.66
but I'm to say at the same hand it is if

2491.21 --> 2498.17
you think about MRI machines right the

2494.66 --> 2500.75
concept of scanning what is inside is

2498.17 --> 2504.5
not really that unique because before

2500.75 --> 2507.65
that we had x-ray scan so again yes the

2504.5 --> 2511.03
process the technical process is unique

2507.65 --> 2514.309
they definitely figure that one out but

2511.03 --> 2518.8590000000004
again it's an upgrade isn't it it is

2514.309 --> 2522.579
like a let's get an x-ray but better

2518.859 --> 2522.5789999999997
right right

2539.55 --> 2548.1400000000003
no nothing experts yeah yeah they also

2543.3 --> 2551.75
invent a lot of nonsense stories so

2548.14 --> 2551.75
[Music]

2557.79 --> 2561.3089999999997
[Music]

2567.57 --> 2570.7690000000002
[Music]

2577.11 --> 2582.77
a GM don't do that

2597.34 --> 2603.73
well it's difficult to say big jungus

2599.89 --> 2607.42
because are you defining flatty by

2603.73 --> 2610.12
people that are now talking about it on

2607.42 --> 2612.61
the Internet in the last rough 10 years

2610.12 --> 2614.44
or so is that a flat E or are you

2612.61 --> 2616.98
talking about people in the past that

2614.44 --> 2621.46
probably would have been flat earthers

2616.98 --> 2623.86
but either that part has been erased or

2621.46 --> 2626.2
they chose not to come out for it

2623.86 --> 2628.09
because heliocentric and religion was

2626.2 --> 2631.8999999999996
kind of like cracking down on everyone

2628.09 --> 2636.1200000000003
so do you even know in the past who was

2631.9 --> 2647.08
a flat earther or if they were a global

2636.12 --> 2649.63
yeah no make to Yungas I'll bet there's

2647.08 --> 2651.25
a lot of people that definitely did not

2649.63 --> 2654.3900000000003
believe the world was a ball that

2651.25 --> 2654.39
invented great things

2677.88 --> 2686.67
okay unicorns they I don't know I just

2680.1 --> 2689.1
went by what they said you know I guess

2686.67 --> 2691.2000000000003
I should know better than to take a

2689.1 --> 2698.93
ballers word on anything at this point

2691.2 --> 2698.93
especially random individuals but yeah

2717.19 --> 2719.64
yeah

2723.869 --> 2730.03
all right well jon snow king of the

2727.03 --> 2731.8900000000003
north if that is true not saying that

2730.03 --> 2735.34
doesn't please don't use caps anymore

2731.89 --> 2737.47
thank you very much then yeah again it's

2735.34 --> 2745.2400000000002
not like they invented vacuum cleaners

2737.47 --> 2748.3799999999997
they just did an upgrade thingy again

2745.24 --> 2756.7799999999997
they didn't invent anything they just

2748.38 --> 2761.2000000000003
tried to improve things reinvent upgrade

2756.78 --> 2765.0400000000004
that's for everything I've seen NASA do

2761.2 --> 2767.3799999999997
in the past even or claims what I've

2765.04 --> 2770.2
done it's always upgrading things they

2767.38 --> 2773.6400000000003
never invent things from scratch new

2770.2 --> 2773.64
complete new concepts

2793.15 --> 2799.359
well unicorn Slayer let's get all

2797.64 --> 2802.3289999999997
semantics okay

2799.359 --> 2804.0389999999998
indeed fire is not an invention is it a

2802.329 --> 2808.049
discovery while this all depends you

2804.039 --> 2812.1400000000003
know if you discover that for example

2808.049 --> 2814.47
lightning strikes can set things on fire

2812.14 --> 2818.0789999999997
and then you capture that fire

2814.47 --> 2821.109
let's stick or whatever yeah that could

2818.079 --> 2823.539
be because it a discovery but what if an

2821.109 --> 2827.859
individual figured out how to literally

2823.539 --> 2831.039
make fire by a wire and a stick and

2827.859 --> 2839.19
everything you know for that as a bet is

2831.039 --> 2839.19
kind of a that is kind of an invention

2840.569 --> 2846.49
it's a mechanical device that can do

2843.4 --> 2852.579
something that people couldn't do before

2846.49 --> 2857.64
that so the fire itself is not an

2852.579 --> 2857.6400000000003
invention but ways to make it

2877.539 --> 2883.0490000000004
I have no idea what you're talking about

2894.85 --> 2900.2999999999997
mm-hm okay whatever I don't know

2910.0 --> 2915.9
how beta fandom I wouldn't worry about

2912.46 --> 2922.26
that because I'm pretty sure that

2915.9 --> 2922.26
nuclear fission doesn't exist

2933.25 --> 2940.45
at least not the yeah the nuke version

2938.0 --> 2940.45
as it were

2945.39 --> 2951.299
but yeah Rockets Dennis aft as

2948.18 --> 2953.22
definitely upgraded Rockets pretty sure

2951.299 --> 2957.989
they didn't invent rockets though as

2953.22 --> 2960.66
Rockets not as a transporting device or

2957.989 --> 2963.989
even though in stories that does exist

2960.66 --> 2968.279
Rockets were in the the ancient Chinese

2963.989 --> 2971.489
Empire even so I think there was the

2968.279 --> 2973.68
story about there was a video there was

2971.489 --> 2978.329
a very old movie made about it about how

2973.68 --> 2983.249
the Chinese emperor went on a rocket to

2978.329 --> 2986.67
go to the moon and have you ever seen

2983.249 --> 2989.7
that very old video I think it was from

2986.67 --> 2991.44
the silent movie era but that I think I

2989.7 --> 2995.489
thought that thing was based on an

2991.44 --> 2997.289
actual Chinese story so but Rockets have

2995.489 --> 3001.279
been around for a long time NASA doesn't

2997.289 --> 3003.46
didn't invent them again just upgraded

3001.279 --> 3003.46
them

3011.579 --> 3017.099
rocket blimps yeah the space shuttles

3014.14 --> 3017.0989999999997
right Martin Allen

3023.46 --> 3029.9700000000003
yeah that's a great point ACC blah blah

3027.119 --> 3034.71
blah that's such a great point to create

3029.97 --> 3037.5
NASA so we can afford to do things none

3034.71 --> 3040.7400000000002
of us would be able to individually

3037.5 --> 3043.04
except that we could we just wouldn't be

3040.74 --> 3045.39
forced to and the public could actually

3043.04 --> 3050.609
maybe make up their own mind about

3045.39 --> 3053.1299999999997
spending their money and I don't know

3050.609 --> 3060.45
maybe there's something better to spend

3053.13 --> 3062.579
that money on really like for example

3060.45 --> 3065.1899999999996
why love would since we talked about the

3062.579 --> 3066.63
US NASA and alright why don't they spend

3065.19 --> 3070.2000000000003
all that money on just fixing

3066.63 --> 3072.03
infrastructure would be like a pretty

3070.2 --> 3078.8999999999996
much a one-time investment and it would

3072.03 --> 3081.559
fix so much so much so I completely

3078.9 --> 3081.559
disagree

3086.56 --> 3090.72
okay you agree alright

3116.05 --> 3122.75
all right Bing chunga's well technically

3119.18 --> 3130.19
yeah you are correct concerning how much

3122.75 --> 3133.99
money are spent on military very huge

3130.19 --> 3138.079
amounts and huge amounts also just on

3133.99 --> 3141.3199999999997
finances pretty much wasted on them just

3138.079 --> 3144.8
to get keep things from collapsing so

3141.32 --> 3149.98
yeah that those are two other big big

3144.8 --> 3153.619
spending parts on the US it's true but

3149.98 --> 3156.77
okay since yeah there's already so much

3153.619 --> 3159.77
money being wasted on that is it then

3156.77 --> 3162.56
okay well you know that makes NASA money

3159.77 --> 3168.17
look so small so why not NASA yeah is

3162.56 --> 3169.7599999999998
that really good reasoning it's like oh

3168.17 --> 3172.82
that's out of control anyway why not

3169.76 --> 3176.4500000000003
just put nos and there instead of fixing

3172.82 --> 3179.38
the infrastructure one time you know one

3176.45 --> 3179.3799999999997
time big project

3191.91 --> 3194.569
yeah

3194.58 --> 3200.73
hey Howard Maura have you ever heard of

3196.56 --> 3207.02
the bailouts bailouts you know how much

3200.73 --> 3207.02
money is tax money is basically vowed

3207.32 --> 3215.1000000000004
every time and keeps on going I don't

3213.69 --> 3219.33
know if you're aware of this but it's

3215.1 --> 3222.54
just huge amounts of money you could say

3219.33 --> 3224.54
print it out of nothing just to keep

3222.54 --> 3229.02
things from falling apart

3224.54 --> 3240.95
so yes finances lots of tax money is

3229.02 --> 3240.95
going into finance ball

3266.3 --> 3269.05
right

3269.71 --> 3273.369
[Music]

3291.58 --> 3298.17
why are you being such an ass apologist

3294.22 --> 3298.1699999999996
a cc

3312.4 --> 3315.599
[Music]

3319.65 --> 3326.1
okay so because you have a cousin

3323.67 --> 3335.61
working for NASA you feel obligated to

3326.1 --> 3338.36
defend NASA you think your cousin would

3335.61 --> 3344.19
get in trouble if you had doubts about

3338.36 --> 3346.58
legitimate nature of what NASA does she

3344.19 --> 3354.17
of course

3346.58 --> 3354.17
because hey if you're just shilling yeah

3355.83 --> 3359.2999999999997
for your cousin that's

3364.299 --> 3370.73
well because we're talking about real

3367.789 --> 3373.51
arguments here and don't be I don't

3370.73 --> 3379.609
appreciate being subjected to like

3373.51 --> 3384.1400000000003
nepotism you know people who choose to

3379.609 --> 3387.069
side with a bad party because of family

3384.14 --> 3387.069
whatever

3397.17 --> 3402.569
but you're evading the points though

3399.769 --> 3406.1299999999997
shouldn't you be concerned that your

3402.569 --> 3406.13
cousin is working over at NASA

3406.67 --> 3415.5
he's helping lit yeah legitimize vast

3412.44 --> 3420.0190000000002
expenditure with very little empirical

3415.5 --> 3420.019
result and a lot of storytelling

3426.86 --> 3432.19
what does your cousin do over at NASA

3429.59 --> 3432.19
anyway

3449.42 --> 3454.21
well that was my question to you ACCC

3477.06 --> 3486.63
have no idea to tell you the truth paper

3480.81 --> 3490.22
where what okay so you're not here to

3486.63 --> 3490.2200000000003
tell the truth well that's just great

3490.85 --> 3495.0499999999997
stop wasting my time with you then

3498.7 --> 3503.75
[Music]

3521.51 --> 3527.4500000000003
yeah what is problematic you know big

3525.0 --> 3533.46
chunks when somebody gets fooled by

3527.45 --> 3536.0699999999997
being put in a game to help them believe

3533.46 --> 3538.95
the dream of what is going on while they

3536.07 --> 3541.11
are being fooled yeah that then they

3538.95 --> 3543.45
start to perpetuate that dream because

3541.11 --> 3547.85
it becomes personal because if it was

3543.45 --> 3547.85
fake they fell for it it's embarrassing

3568.05 --> 3573.32
okay I've never heard it said in that

3570.39 --> 3573.3199999999997
way big jungus

3586.46 --> 3598.01
yeah I'll bet she is so much wealth

3592.52 --> 3611.079
there isn't it it's not just great yeah

3598.01 --> 3611.079
sorry I don't really care all right

3613.25 --> 3617.019
[Music]

3663.09 --> 3673.1000000000004
now I don't unconditionally hate you I

3665.49 --> 3678.5699999999997
just don't like people that that yeah

3673.1 --> 3680.4
are basically loving all NASA because

3678.57 --> 3683.52
their cousin is working for them

3680.4 --> 3687.15
enriched in all you know it's doesn't

3683.52 --> 3691.22
really help me sympathize with you don't

3687.15 --> 3691.2200000000003
know why I had to over exaggerate that

3700.88 --> 3705.23
Wow how the time has flown

3784.54 --> 3787.77
yeah it's just great

3791.08 --> 3797.88
all right

3793.53 --> 3802.3300000000004
yes it's a lovely myth there at ACC

3797.88 --> 3804.61
hashtag f four six seven six each one of

3802.33 --> 3809.95
us has a chance to get a great job at

3804.61 --> 3812.23
NASA such as NASA I'd take it to mean at

3809.95 --> 3816.3399999999997
NASA but schooling is very hard when

3812.23 --> 3819.01
this must be extremely bright it's hard

3816.34 --> 3822.67
but it's worth in the end yeah extremely

3819.01 --> 3824.86
bright but not too bright though because

3822.67 --> 3827.8
if you're actually gonna see through

3824.86 --> 3831.15
some of the issues and the mechanics and

3827.8 --> 3834.52
you're gonna not abide by peer pressure

3831.15 --> 3839.23
which tends to come with certain types

3834.52 --> 3841.42
of very bright people right then you got

3839.23 --> 3843.85
a problem then you did all this hard

3841.42 --> 3847.81
work and all that [ __ ] but hey if you

3843.85 --> 3850.12
question that question again you're told

3847.81 --> 3853.18
yeah you've done this all for nothing

3850.12 --> 3855.0699999999997
you're out so yeah that's just freaking

3853.18 --> 3858.6699999999996
great you have to be extremely bright

3855.07 --> 3861.9700000000003
but not too bright though just be very

3858.67 --> 3866.91
good at memorizing and don't think too

3861.97 --> 3870.22
hard about what is real only what is

3866.91 --> 3872.77
what fits the framework of what you

3870.22 --> 3874.0899999999997
learn that's the way you have to be

3872.77 --> 3877.21
bright because if you're an actual

3874.09 --> 3879.3700000000003
critical thinker you get in trouble you

3877.21 --> 3882.61
get in trouble with your teachers or

3879.37 --> 3885.46
whatever the the NASA people and then

3882.61 --> 3887.9500000000003
you'll get kicked out and if you try to

3885.46 --> 3890.68
fool them like go along to get along

3887.95 --> 3895.7999999999997
supposedly and then trick them then

3890.68 --> 3899.71
you're screwed then they're really gonna

3895.8 --> 3904.02
give it a one way or the other so yeah

3899.71 --> 3904.02
it's just freakin great man great

3905.92 --> 3913.4900000000002
yeah memory technical insight like

3910.85 --> 3916.7
structures math oversight kind of things

3913.49 --> 3920.75
yeah there's a lot very important skills

3916.7 --> 3923.93
tied into memory and you have to be

3920.75 --> 3925.79
right like that you have to yeah people

3923.93 --> 3929.5699999999997
that don't have good memories are not

3925.79 --> 3930.83
even gonna be tested right yeah that's

3929.57 --> 3936.29
what it's about

3930.83 --> 3938.21
is easy not real wisdom you think they

3936.29 --> 3942.2599999999998
let in somebody that was like really

3938.21 --> 3944.87
religiously studied and not declaring

3942.26 --> 3951.5200000000004
themselves as an atheist you think that

3944.87 --> 3951.52
I accept that don't think so

3958.46 --> 3962.69
you could probably call yourself a

3960.829 --> 3966.079
Christian as long as it's just a

3962.69 --> 3968.0
Christian in name you know because if

3966.079 --> 3969.619
you actually say well maybe the earth is

3968.0 --> 3972.26
not a ball because in the Bible or where

3969.619 --> 3977.42
sort of things firmament split creation

3972.26 --> 3979.73
oh no wait that's now you're not you can

3977.42 --> 3981.7400000000002
keep those beliefs to yourself

3979.73 --> 3985.579
according to NASA I'm pretty sure about

3981.74 --> 3986.47
it so yeah now it's not just being

3985.579 --> 3990.579
bright

3986.47 --> 3990.5789999999997
you're gonna reconcile with that

4000.81 --> 4010.56
no Tom Parker nobody has pics of craters

4004.41 --> 4012.5899999999997
on the moon there's no craters on the

4010.56 --> 4016.0499999999997
moon

4012.59 --> 4019.2200000000003
it's not even object it's not even an

4016.05 --> 4019.2200000000003
object so

4027.86 --> 4030.989
[Music]

4048.89 --> 4059.18
working for NASA are mean that they have

4055.16 --> 4063.31
no heart that they're all just monsters

4059.18 --> 4066.71
is that what I said ACC or did I just

4063.31 --> 4068.84
explain something about the hierarchy

4066.71 --> 4072.95
and what is done and what is not done

4068.84 --> 4077.599
and not actually emphasizing on typical

4072.95 --> 4080.0299999999997
character traits or fee or even yeah

4077.599 --> 4084.6090000000004
