98.759 --> 105.259
it's yeah clouded

101.759 --> 105.259
pretty much clouded up

108.0 --> 111.96
it's not as much wind

110.1 --> 114.36
but yeah there's not any sun coming

111.96 --> 117.5
through this hasn't been

114.36 --> 117.5
all morning either

120.96 --> 125.6
so I think it's probably cooled off a

123.18 --> 125.60000000000001
little too

130.02 --> 132.20000000000002

Friday Leaf 30th

152.4 --> 156.3
of July 2021

158.76 --> 163.98
and

161.7 --> 165.959
yeah I quickly put something together

163.98 --> 168.48
with the title today

165.959 --> 171.54
I

168.48 --> 174.66
I don't really know

171.54 --> 176.819
I want to keep this like

174.66 --> 180.18
last couple of days

176.819 --> 184.14
like these really came together

180.18 --> 186.48000000000002
title wise I'm not 100 sure of this one

184.14 --> 189.44
although yeah it's still there's still

186.48 --> 189.44
something in there

189.48 --> 194.89999999999998
kind of riding literally writing the

192.12 --> 194.9
theme of yesterday

196.319 --> 202.099
but we'll see where this goes well

198.599 --> 202.099
besides Downstream

202.44 --> 207.48
anyway

204.48 --> 207.48
yeah

208.739 --> 213.659
see

210.42 --> 217.07999999999998
yesterday's Flat Earth debate it's very

213.659 --> 222.06
energetic and lasted very long

217.08 --> 224.34
the after show was one and a half hours

222.06 --> 226.12
so yeah should make a very good Saturday

224.34 --> 229.3
stream

226.12 --> 229.3
[Music]

233.28 --> 236.48
uh also yeah

237.78 --> 243.18
heard that tomorrow is going to be a

240.54 --> 245.57999999999998
live ball busters again

243.18 --> 247.56
so yeah looking forward to that it's

245.58 --> 249.9
been too long

247.56 --> 252.9
like

249.9 --> 255.62
last time was like a month ago

252.9 --> 255.62
anyway

255.959 --> 258.959
uh

261.959 --> 266.18
Benjamin had some good streams too

266.58 --> 273.19899999999996
I haven't even taken a glimpse yet at

269.759 --> 273.199
the last stream we uploaded

274.86 --> 282.199
just this morning saw it but uh yeah

279.479 --> 282.199
other than that

289.56 --> 294.3
all right yeah yeah I saw this weird

292.86 --> 297.36
stream

294.3 --> 300.90000000000003
overhead gyranism I didn't see his life

297.36 --> 302.34000000000003
though but I did watch it afterward

300.9 --> 306.17999999999995
uh

302.34 --> 309.35999999999996
very weird a Global News Network where

306.18 --> 312.539
they were basically being

309.36 --> 318.139
ironic the entire time but it was a

312.539 --> 318.139
little unnerving at times but still yeah

318.78 --> 326.17999999999995
they did have a lot of fun doing that

322.68 --> 326.18
right and that's about it

333.419 --> 335.96
all right

336.78 --> 341.35999999999996
oh is there some weird lighting issue

338.94 --> 341.36
going on

344.639 --> 350.78000000000003
did you see that it was just like going

347.4 --> 350.78
back and forth really weird

353.759 --> 359.84000000000003
anyway so where is everybody in chat

356.88 --> 359.84
come on guys

391.139 --> 397.56
or maybe I'll just sit here for 50

395.039 --> 401.479
minutes straight before anybody does

397.56 --> 401.479
anything in chat

404.84 --> 410.21999999999997
just sit on this petal here riding

408.18 --> 413.479
Downstream and just see if there's

410.22 --> 413.47900000000004
anybody else out there

431.099 --> 438.02
any feedback yesterday's stream any

434.46 --> 438.02
feedback at all from anybody

441.479 --> 447.78
oh by the way besides Aaron Armstrong

445.08 --> 451.74
who literally tried to bribe me through

447.78 --> 454.55999999999995
PayPal I refunded it

451.74 --> 456.539
for some reason that guy demands to be

454.56 --> 459.78000000000003
unbanned and he wants to be a part of my

456.539 --> 464.24
show and that's not gonna happen

459.78 --> 464.23999999999995
find him very annoying so

464.28 --> 467.539
I still hope that

469.139 --> 474.06
more people would show up in my stream

472.02 --> 476.94
in chat

474.06 --> 479.94
yesterday was all filled up

476.94 --> 483.8
did any everybody go out and party last

479.94 --> 483.8
night on the Thursday and

484.8 --> 488.699
can we talk about the Isle of Man why

487.319 --> 490.44
would you want to talk about that

488.699 --> 492.12
conspiracy cats

490.44 --> 494.639
I mean

492.12 --> 497.46
since you are pretty much the only one

494.639 --> 499.319
actually in chat besides rocket blimp

497.46 --> 501.479
saying hi

499.319 --> 503.52000000000004
six minutes ago

501.479 --> 505.68
seven minutes ago

503.52 --> 508.34
I'm pretty much up for any conversation

505.68 --> 508.34000000000003
at this point

514.44 --> 518.0
so yeah what about it

541.98 --> 545.94
okay was that just a theoretical

544.26 --> 548.58
question as in

545.94 --> 551.339
can we talk about it

548.58 --> 554.4200000000001
or you actually have anything to talk

551.339 --> 554.4200000000001
about about it

554.94 --> 562.08
did Nathan think it was Fe proof well it

558.66 --> 565.74
was the first signs of Black Swan of

562.08 --> 569.24
global geometry defying sites

565.74 --> 569.24
so in that sense yes

573.14 --> 580.04
Australia and England are in extra time

576.6 --> 580.0400000000001
in so what soccer

581.519 --> 584.72
are you talking about

584.94 --> 589.2790000000001
or you mean like the Olympics or

587.16 --> 589.279
something

595.08 --> 600.0
he was wrong though was he no no he

597.36 --> 603.12
wasn't it is a Black Swan

600.0 --> 604.74
was only the original mistake there was

603.12 --> 606.14
one mistake originally made in the

604.74 --> 609.54
sightings and that's that we thought

606.14 --> 612.12
that Ireland was actually visible

609.54 --> 616.6999999999999
that was a mistake

612.12 --> 616.7
but still with the observation height

617.88 --> 624.38
it was still definitely proof

621.06 --> 624.38
that it's not a globe

627.6 --> 632.4590000000001
no he didn't get the Observer height

629.579 --> 634.56
wrong and the picture was repeated

632.459 --> 637.8599999999999
several times

634.56 --> 640.14
an extremely low observation height

637.86 --> 643.38
right it wasn't just a singular picture

640.14 --> 646.22
it was a location and people went there

643.38 --> 646.22
several times

648.779 --> 651.62
uh

664.019 --> 667.22
money jokes now

668.16 --> 675.98
oh that's just great I put it on mute

671.399 --> 675.98
and then it didn't go on mute

676.14 --> 681.8389999999999
uh okay

679.079 --> 685.3389999999999
but since well since when is football

681.839 --> 685.339
part of the Olympics

685.86 --> 691.76
oh wait is it women's football

689.339 --> 691.7600000000001
[ __ ]

699.48 --> 704.64
what was the Observer height it was

702.18 --> 706.26
different with different people was in

704.64 --> 710.3389999999999
between

706.26 --> 712.92
was it like six foot and

710.339 --> 716.24
20.

712.92 --> 716.24
several Heights

726.0 --> 728.839
wow

745.279 --> 750.019
we won what are you talking about

768.12 --> 774.779
hello Cleary by the way return to normal

772.2 --> 778.279
and George Sanford

774.779 --> 778.279
drunken bullet411

797.94 --> 802.9200000000001
wow

800.519 --> 805.079
holy [ __ ] they just keep on dropping and

802.92 --> 807.8
dropping

805.079 --> 807.8
ah

820.68 --> 828.3
yeah return to normal it's yeah I'm

825.18 --> 830.899
I I kind of lost my interest in the

828.3 --> 835.16
Olympics when I figured out it was like

830.899 --> 839.639
extremely woke and all that nonsense

835.16 --> 844.459
especially after that crazy performance

839.639 --> 844.4590000000001
like the United States athletic team

845.279 --> 850.199
where that girl just stopped playing

847.92 --> 853.0999999999999
because of mental issues and now that's

850.199 --> 856.4399999999999
a whole thing raging on it's so

853.1 --> 859.32
unbelievably embarrassing and annoying

856.44 --> 862.5
this like after that I kind of like

859.32 --> 866.339
internally vowed like I am not going to

862.5 --> 870.18
watch anything about the Olympics

866.339 --> 872.4590000000001
until I know with guarantee that it is

870.18 --> 874.279
completely woke free

872.459 --> 875.899
and then I might

874.279 --> 879.92
basically

875.899 --> 879.92
consider watching it again

901.8 --> 910.3389999999999
Now quickly moving on to uh an a more

905.699 --> 910.3389999999999
personal question now conspiracy cats

910.38 --> 918.54
are you trying to pry me open for secret

914.36 --> 921.74
little facts about Nathan

918.54 --> 921.74
why don't you go ask him

960.779 --> 965.8389999999999
he's bored on his imaginary Globe yeah I

963.36 --> 965.839
bet he is

970.32 --> 978.86
wow conspiracy cat that is really gay

975.24 --> 978.86
it's really really gay

983.639 --> 989.88
and also it's a very stupid Cowboy name

986.519 --> 992.579
because Cowboys are not Hunters yeah

989.88 --> 995.579
that's a hunter name that's a ranger

992.579 --> 999.959
name a cowboy

995.579 --> 1003.8
is a man with a lot of fortitude who

999.959 --> 1005.899
rides horses and keeps the cows together

1003.8 --> 1009.16
from wandering off

1005.899 --> 1009.16
they don't hunt

1020.12 --> 1025.779
no don't that's not necessary return to

1023.54 --> 1025.779
normal

1036.26 --> 1043.8799999999999
they hunted cows yeah but that's not

1039.5 --> 1045.679
they don't stalk cows and their cows are

1043.88 --> 1048.74
not there prey because they don't kill

1045.679 --> 1052.88
them they heard them they don't hunt

1048.74 --> 1055.4
cows they hurt them like hello

1052.88 --> 1057.919
I know you've been living on a globe for

1055.4 --> 1060.679
a very long time in your mind but could

1057.919 --> 1062.8400000000001
you maybe work out the details of how

1060.679 --> 1065.72
things actually are out there in the

1062.84 --> 1067.82
real world into your Globe conception

1065.72 --> 1071.5
inside of your head because everything

1067.82 --> 1071.5
you said makes no damn sense

1073.7 --> 1078.44
like these are things that a

1076.1 --> 1081.1999999999998
five-year-old says and then their

1078.44 --> 1083.66
parents correct them just like I did

1081.2 --> 1086.24
you're supposed to be a grown man and a

1083.66 --> 1089.02
teacher I shouldn't be half to telling

1086.24 --> 1089.02
you these things

1095.059 --> 1101.1789999999999
well conspiracy cats they should not

1097.52 --> 1103.66
hurt yeah well do you know what hunting

1101.179 --> 1103.66
is

1105.26 --> 1108.22
seem like you do

1109.76 --> 1115.299
cows are food well that that's all fine

1113.9 --> 1119.8400000000001
and dandy

1115.299 --> 1123.32
but Cowboys heard the cows they don't

1119.84 --> 1127.58
kill them they don't slaughter them

1123.32 --> 1131.299
the Rancher who owns the cows might

1127.58 --> 1134.72
decide to have some of their stocks

1131.299 --> 1137.2
slaughtered by a butcher Cowboys don't

1134.72 --> 1137.2
do that

1149.72 --> 1151.9
foreign

1159.98 --> 1165.94
can we get the wrench arrested okay well

1162.14 --> 1165.94
if you want to lose your job sure

1175.88 --> 1183.6200000000001
like Cowboys are not self-sufficient

1180.02 --> 1186.16
right they're employees they work for

1183.62 --> 1186.1599999999999
Ranchers

1186.32 --> 1189.76
did you know that

1203.539 --> 1211.1
oh we do do humor here oh yes we do

1208.4 --> 1214.46
it's very easy to make fun of somebody

1211.1 --> 1216.799
that's being really stupid

1214.46 --> 1219.8600000000001
right and just because your original

1216.799 --> 1221.179
inquiry about the Isle of Man

1219.86 --> 1224.1789999999999
failed

1221.179 --> 1226.2800000000002
to accomplish what you wanted does it

1224.179 --> 1228.799
mean that I'm just gonna allow you to

1226.28 --> 1230.1789999999999
move on to making really silly

1228.799 --> 1233.24
statements

1230.179 --> 1235.5800000000002
without correcting those because I like

1233.24 --> 1238.28
to correct Glovers I like to remind them

1235.58 --> 1241.34
how utterly fallacious

1238.28 --> 1244.039
they are in so many things Beyond just

1241.34 --> 1247.539
what they believe they stand on

1244.039 --> 1247.539
I like to remind them

1258.96 --> 1262.099
[Music]

1265.16 --> 1268.429
[Music]

1311.179 --> 1313.3600000000001
foreign

1323.059 --> 1326.62
dude get a point

1327.02 --> 1331.299
like that is so dumb I'm not even gonna

1331.46 --> 1334.48
correct that

1342.14 --> 1344.919
going on again

1352.46 --> 1359.2
well George Sanford

1354.38 --> 1359.2
no but he is that lame though

1366.38 --> 1372.3200000000002
okay conspiracy cat look I'm not

1368.96 --> 1375.44
desperate for some Goofy

1372.32 --> 1377.36
Man Child hanging around just blurting

1375.44 --> 1380.179
out nonsense right

1377.36 --> 1382.34
I'm not eager to have my time completely

1380.179 --> 1383.539
wasted on nonsense

1382.34 --> 1385.58
right

1383.539 --> 1387.919
when I mean talk about anything that

1385.58 --> 1391.6399999999999
means any a subject that could actually

1387.919 --> 1393.74
be interesting or is any relevance to

1391.64 --> 1397.9
something right

1393.74 --> 1397.9
not just blabbering nonsense

1409.4 --> 1416.2
right so anybody else guys

1412.4 --> 1416.2
please feel free to

1417.02 --> 1422.6589999999999
start any subject

1419.659 --> 1426.4
so I could start ignoring

1422.659 --> 1426.4
this silly person

1440.36 --> 1445.6
wasn't there a good joke about

1441.919 --> 1445.6000000000001
conspiracy cats no

1447.2 --> 1450.039
not really

1462.559 --> 1467.4189999999999
what is his famous saying right yeah he

1464.84 --> 1470.0
did say something a while back

1467.419 --> 1472.2990000000002
was it on my show I don't remember where

1470.0 --> 1472.299
it was

1474.32 --> 1479.059
I think it happened on a haunted house

1476.779 --> 1482.059
too but I think that because I did have

1479.059 --> 1484.8799999999999
conspiracy cats like

1482.059 --> 1488.059
on my show a while back

1484.88 --> 1491.5390000000002
when I didn't really know who it was yet

1488.059 --> 1494.059
and I remember him saying that

1491.539 --> 1497.36
you require

1494.059 --> 1499.8799999999999
a containment for gas pressure

1497.36 --> 1502.84
right he did state that and then later

1499.88 --> 1502.8400000000001
on haunted house

1503.539 --> 1508.279
Nathan likes to remind us he got all

1506.0 --> 1509.539
worried because what if they are all

1508.279 --> 1512.059
lying

1509.539 --> 1513.98
and he felt very unsafe about it right

1512.059 --> 1516.46
that's what what you know conspiracy

1513.98 --> 1516.46
cuts off

1517.46 --> 1521.0
can't remember I well that's because

1519.2 --> 1524.14
it's now like

1521.0 --> 1524.14
two years ago

1528.86 --> 1535.779
famous saying is Nathan's what's

1531.679 --> 1535.779
diffraction what's famous about that

1550.7 --> 1555.8600000000001
what's diffraction is about as a

1553.22 --> 1559.159
relevant question is who why the

1555.86 --> 1561.3799999999999
antipodal star rotations right

1559.159 --> 1564.3400000000001
it's about on the same level of

1561.38 --> 1564.3400000000001
completely useless

1566.48 --> 1572.24
right but I yeah back in the day

1569.48 --> 1573.799
during the Isle of Man age when we

1572.24 --> 1577.52
didn't figure out yet about the

1573.799 --> 1581.6589999999999
geometric Horizon yeah we were trying to

1577.52 --> 1584.179
puzzle together how the Optics works

1581.659 --> 1585.679
and there was confusion concerning

1584.179 --> 1589.22
diffraction

1585.679 --> 1592.279
and refraction I can personally attest

1589.22 --> 1594.64
to that like I was very confused with

1592.279 --> 1594.64
the difference

1595.039 --> 1599.179
now that's all more filled in now it's

1597.44 --> 1602.3600000000001
much more clear as to how Optics

1599.179 --> 1604.94
actually work to me in a very broad way

1602.36 --> 1607.82
and I'm happy that I'm able to actually

1604.94 --> 1608.8600000000001
explain a lot of these workings in

1607.82 --> 1613.1589999999999
detail

1608.86 --> 1616.039
and much more clearly explain the visual

1613.159 --> 1618.0200000000002
experience that people will have what

1616.039 --> 1620.32
it's like what is actually happening

1618.02 --> 1620.32
inside

1620.72 --> 1625.82
did Nathan good well none of us could

1623.299 --> 1629.179
really answer at the time because we

1625.82 --> 1631.3999999999999
didn't really understand much yet back

1629.179 --> 1635.6000000000001
then do we still thought

1631.4 --> 1638.0590000000002
that the Horizon would be geometric

1635.6 --> 1639.1399999999999
we were still trying to find a Black

1638.059 --> 1643.4189999999999
Swan

1639.14 --> 1643.419
and we have since then a lot of them

1660.62 --> 1667.039
school kids know really school kids know

1663.98 --> 1668.659
what diffraction is do they now Tony

1667.039 --> 1672.02
mantle

1668.659 --> 1676.24
how many school kids did you ask kind of

1672.02 --> 1676.24
a [ __ ] statement is that

1676.399 --> 1682.76
there's very few people in the world

1678.86 --> 1685.4599999999998
that actually understand details and can

1682.76 --> 1686.899
relay them and explain them about Optics

1685.46 --> 1689.8990000000001
okay

1686.899 --> 1692.899
school kids don't know that's pure

1689.899 --> 1692.899
horseshit

1696.34 --> 1701.32
yeah you teach that fraction I bet you

1699.14 --> 1701.3200000000002
do

1703.7 --> 1708.0800000000002
oh gets about 14 learn it well I didn't

1706.46 --> 1712.659
learn it and I went to a pretty damn

1708.08 --> 1712.6589999999999
good school so that's complete horseshit

1716.539 --> 1721.48
unless they have specific Optics

1718.76 --> 1721.48
packages

1725.179 --> 1730.94
physics lessons oh well that means that

1727.94 --> 1733.88
you automatically understand and know it

1730.94 --> 1737.179
right I'm sure that if there's people

1733.88 --> 1739.94
there's kids that know how to learn

1737.179 --> 1741.6200000000001
things by heart very easily yeah they'll

1739.94 --> 1743.539
read that part and they'll be able to

1741.62 --> 1747.62
Echo it does that mean they totally

1743.539 --> 1750.3799999999999
understand the com like its place within

1747.62 --> 1752.9189999999999
the experience of sight I very much

1750.38 --> 1752.919
doubt it

1771.26 --> 1776.62
well I did learn it in school in physics

1773.84 --> 1780.02
I just it didn't really stick too much

1776.62 --> 1781.6399999999999
it was too confusing it was like too

1780.02 --> 1783.98
many different elements it just didn't

1781.64 --> 1786.88
stick too much

1783.98 --> 1786.88
I later

1787.58 --> 1792.9399999999998
just

1789.02 --> 1792.94
kind of forgot all about it

1793.52 --> 1798.98
but yeah I have since learned it much

1796.399 --> 1801.9399999999998
better than I originally learned it

1798.98 --> 1801.94
right yeah

1807.559 --> 1812.059
what's so funny about that

1809.72 --> 1817.179
what oh you think you think that I

1812.059 --> 1820.76
pretend to be this absolutely brilliant

1817.179 --> 1823.52
brilliant person that like

1820.76 --> 1825.5
every part of my life when I just look

1823.52 --> 1829.279
at something I immediately understand

1825.5 --> 1830.899
everything about it Way Beyond what

1829.279 --> 1832.94
normal people could get out of One

1830.899 --> 1835.82
Singular piece of information

1832.94 --> 1839.1200000000001
uh no

1835.82 --> 1841.52
I wasn't like that when I was younger

1839.12 --> 1844.58
yeah it was quick yeah I was smart but

1841.52 --> 1848.36
not a lot of things would rub off on me

1844.58 --> 1851.1399999999999
because if I didn't get a grip I would

1848.36 --> 1851.1399999999999
kind of lose interest

1855.2 --> 1859.299
hello Neil

1856.64 --> 1859.2990000000002
see you

1876.679 --> 1884.72
yeah that's right Thomas 8955 look the

1881.24 --> 1887.6
standard effect of light

1884.72 --> 1889.46
yeah that did stick like weird angular

1887.6 --> 1892.519
deviations

1889.46 --> 1894.5
I understand diffraction limit like

1892.519 --> 1896.24
because

1894.5 --> 1899.14
I kind of worked

1896.24 --> 1899.14
with a

1899.299 --> 1905.6589999999999
the visual rendering program that

1902.48 --> 1907.76
actually used that so I was like able to

1905.659 --> 1909.7990000000002
fool around with it in a virtual

1907.76 --> 1912.3799999999999
environment

1909.799 --> 1915.1399999999999
so diffraction limit always did stick to

1912.38 --> 1918.3200000000002
me because I actually worked with it

1915.14 --> 1920.779
but that doesn't automatically make me

1918.32 --> 1923.12
understand what diffraction really is I

1920.779 --> 1924.559
just understand like how it works

1923.12 --> 1927.6789999999999
practically

1924.559 --> 1932.26
that there is this effect

1927.679 --> 1932.26
that part I did very much remember

1935.84 --> 1940.82
like even in the exploration phase of

1938.539 --> 1943.82
the Flat Earth debates concerning Optics

1940.82 --> 1946.34
I would bring it forth as a subject like

1943.82 --> 1947.48
just like the diffraction limit

1946.34 --> 1950.0
right

1947.48 --> 1952.519
it's like this

1950.0 --> 1954.38
angular change because of the medium

1952.519 --> 1956.48
like that part I would always start

1954.38 --> 1958.5800000000002
explaining because I still remember that

1956.48 --> 1961.3990000000001
that's the part that I really understand

1958.58 --> 1964.039
from practical experience

1961.399 --> 1966.9189999999999
the rest was kind of blurry

1964.039 --> 1970.1589999999999
couldn't still all place it into like a

1966.919 --> 1973.279
singular model of sight

1970.159 --> 1975.2600000000002
but yeah that sense has changed so yeah

1973.279 --> 1979.46
we all learn

1975.26 --> 1983.019
at least most people do eventually

1979.46 --> 1983.019
unlike some others

2026.679 --> 2030.519
right observing effect doesn't mean you

2028.659 --> 2033.64
know the cause

2030.519 --> 2037.24
or details right it's just observing

2033.64 --> 2039.039
data observing effects in nature

2037.24 --> 2041.38
because those effects are not gonna

2039.039 --> 2043.36
change those effects will be those

2041.38 --> 2046.72
effects right and therefore it's always

2043.36 --> 2049.659
good to remember that that effect exists

2046.72 --> 2050.919
whether you know the causal details of

2049.659 --> 2052.78
it or not

2050.919 --> 2055.6589999999997
and that's what I did when I was younger

2052.78 --> 2058.0600000000004
mostly just observe unique things and

2055.659 --> 2062.52
effects

2058.06 --> 2062.52
things that would challenge my centuries

2064.96 --> 2070.78
and then relying on that over time I

2068.8 --> 2074.32
would be able to put it all together

2070.78 --> 2078.2400000000002
well that worked out great

2074.32 --> 2078.2400000000002
my strategy paid off

2082.12 --> 2085.2799999999997
[Music]

2089.619 --> 2091.859
foreign

2128.92 --> 2131.16
foreign

2136.02 --> 2142.2599999999998
I think somebody's like cutting tiles or

2138.94 --> 2142.26
something it's very noisy

2147.16 --> 2150.839
they were doing it yesterday as well

2182.2 --> 2185.7
right so anyway

2199.24 --> 2204.2799999999997
right yeah damn somatic I agree that

2202.54 --> 2206.98
with that

2204.28 --> 2209.38
because as as I started out with this

2206.98 --> 2211.119
conversation as soon as the kids in

2209.38 --> 2213.76
school were brought into the subject

2211.119 --> 2215.32
yeah they may learn things by heart if

2213.76 --> 2219.7200000000003
they're very good at it that they can

2215.32 --> 2221.98
rattle off like a dictionary or like a

2219.72 --> 2223.839
encyclopedia they could rattle off

2221.98 --> 2226.66
something that they've learned by heart

2223.839 --> 2229.96
is like the solution that doesn't

2226.66 --> 2232.18
actually imply that they could be

2229.96 --> 2235.7200000000003
addressed to that thing they learn by

2232.18 --> 2238.359
heart and then be made to explain every

2235.72 --> 2240.52
part of it proving that they actually

2238.359 --> 2244.2599999999998
understand what they now know by heart

2240.52 --> 2244.2599999999998
right that's the issue

2247.54 --> 2254.68
in school you get rewarded

2250.24 --> 2256.839
more by learning things by heart then

2254.68 --> 2259.72
actually understanding those things

2256.839 --> 2263.4
although we have some

2259.72 --> 2263.3999999999996
subjects that is critical

2265.48 --> 2270.099
but yeah plenty of kids have just gone

2267.7 --> 2272.4399999999996
through school learning [ __ ] by heart

2270.099 --> 2275.56
and not giving

2272.44 --> 2278.38
not giving a [ __ ] about any of it and

2275.56 --> 2281.2
literally forgetting all of it afterward

2278.38 --> 2283.78
they just rely on learning things

2281.2 --> 2285.8199999999997
so they memorize it and then because

2283.78 --> 2288.2400000000002
they don't care they just forget about

2285.82 --> 2288.2400000000002
it again

2307.18 --> 2312.22
look just go out there in the world

2310.18 --> 2315.52
wherever you're at

2312.22 --> 2319.18
especially in City areas

2315.52 --> 2320.38
and check out all the 40 year old men

2319.18 --> 2323.14
and women

2320.38 --> 2326.079
30 year old even but let's just say 40

2323.14 --> 2328.9
year old like you can probably assume

2326.079 --> 2331.119
that all of them went to school

2328.9 --> 2332.6800000000003
now why don't you test them on the

2331.119 --> 2336.339
school knowledge

2332.68 --> 2339.04
see how much of them actually get it

2336.339 --> 2341.5
right or they might need to be like oh

2339.04 --> 2343.66
what is that again freshen up a little

2341.5 --> 2346.599
but let's just test

2343.66 --> 2350.46
test them out how much do they actually

2346.599 --> 2350.46
understand of the things they learn

2380.38 --> 2386.6400000000003
some learning is needed before you can

2382.96 --> 2389.619
fully understand the topic not really

2386.64 --> 2393.04
exposure is what is needed

2389.619 --> 2395.2000000000003
and through exposure

2393.04 --> 2398.92
the structure

2395.2 --> 2401.2599999999998
and the details the words may rub off

2398.92 --> 2403.119
much more easily on you

2401.26 --> 2406.9
right you don't necessarily have to

2403.119 --> 2409.7200000000003
engage in the memorization process I

2406.9 --> 2411.1600000000003
mean you could do it if the exposure

2409.72 --> 2412.839
you're going to be subjected to

2411.16 --> 2416.7
concerning the subject is going to be

2412.839 --> 2416.7
very limited like one lecture

2417.64 --> 2423.16
now one way to do that also if that some

2421.599 --> 2425.619
people actually do that is just record

2423.16 --> 2428.3799999999997
the lecture

2425.619 --> 2431.319
cut it down to when you know it is the

2428.38 --> 2433.42
relevant subject and then just keep it

2431.319 --> 2435.46
on a loop just keep playing it playing

2433.42 --> 2438.04
it playing it until you've heard it like

2435.46 --> 2440.26
a thousand times or a thousand times

2438.04 --> 2443.859
maybe a bit Overkill

2440.26 --> 2446.26
and that way you get exposure too

2443.859 --> 2449.339
actively learning things by heart

2446.26 --> 2453.3390000000004
doesn't give any

2449.339 --> 2453.339
understanding advantage

2468.599 --> 2475.6600000000003
education because in education in the

2472.96 --> 2478.599
education foundational system

2475.66 --> 2481.14
it's mostly based on learning things by

2478.599 --> 2484.3
heart and not

2481.14 --> 2487.66
on teaching the ability to critically

2484.3 --> 2491.1400000000003
think about data

2487.66 --> 2493.8999999999996
right and therefore the education system

2491.14 --> 2495.7
in general as it is right now is very

2493.9 --> 2501.1800000000003
prone

2495.7 --> 2501.18
to propaganda influences of all levels

2504.52 --> 2508.14
political corporate

2508.42 --> 2513.1800000000003
even

2509.8 --> 2513.1800000000003
French religious

2516.4 --> 2521.56
it's vulnerable it's just because

2519.0 --> 2525.819
everybody's made to learn [ __ ] by heart

2521.56 --> 2527.44
not actually critically think and debate

2525.819 --> 2530.619
right

2527.44 --> 2535.18
how many schools actually have debating

2530.619 --> 2537.339
of students as a standard

2535.18 --> 2540.64
approach

2537.339 --> 2542.56
I mean there are debates in school and

2540.64 --> 2544.1189999999997
it's like oh now you're going to go to

2542.56 --> 2546.099
bed and you stand in front of the glass

2544.119 --> 2549.4
in front of the other one and then one

2546.099 --> 2553.96
by one you make your arguments right

2549.4 --> 2556.2400000000002
how many times does this actually work

2553.96 --> 2558.52
because most of the time it's probably

2556.24 --> 2561.22
just people reading it off a paper being

2558.52 --> 2562.54
really nervous that they're standing in

2561.22 --> 2565.839
front of the class

2562.54 --> 2568.9
and they just try to

2565.839 --> 2571.24
keep a grasp on the subject in order to

2568.9 --> 2575.7000000000003
like respond properly in the debate

2571.24 --> 2575.7
right is that really debating no

2576.16 --> 2581.44
not really

2577.66 --> 2583.06
it's more like simulating a debate

2581.44 --> 2586.18
because

2583.06 --> 2589.119
yeah unless the students are very much

2586.18 --> 2591.22
personally into the subject

2589.119 --> 2594.6400000000003
it's going to be like that

2591.22 --> 2596.98
'd just be trying to debate

2594.64 --> 2599.0789999999997
to fulfill the conditions of what the

2596.98 --> 2601.54
debate is for their grade or whatever

2599.079 --> 2604.599
and that's it

2601.54 --> 2607.839
but if debating was a standard thing

2604.599 --> 2611.94
that was like okay

2607.839 --> 2611.94
the teacher just explained it

2612.339 --> 2618.94
who here has questions and then

2615.819 --> 2622.0
let let the students

2618.94 --> 2624.099
audibly debate with one another well

2622.0 --> 2626.319
there has to be the chemistry among the

2624.099 --> 2630.099
students though for that to happen has

2626.319 --> 2632.619
to be a dynamic that can work

2630.099 --> 2634.78
so it yeah if everybody's just kind of

2632.619 --> 2637.96
like sitting still silent just follow

2634.78 --> 2640.44
the leader types that's very unlikely to

2637.96 --> 2640.44
work

2640.48 --> 2645.04
because they will all be feeling like

2642.4 --> 2646.6600000000003
they're on the spot every time and they

2645.04 --> 2648.88
won't be comfortable with that that's

2646.66 --> 2652.24
why they are like that

2648.88 --> 2654.819
but if you can get actual debate back

2652.24 --> 2657.04
and forth is to make it a standard thing

2654.819 --> 2658.66
or to even find a way to encourage it

2657.04 --> 2661.599
then

2658.66 --> 2663.3999999999996
it could work much better as long as you

2661.599 --> 2664.78
leave freaking politics out of it

2663.4 --> 2668.819
because as soon as that happens

2664.78 --> 2668.8190000000004
everything goes to [ __ ] every time

2669.339 --> 2675.7
so the debate should always be guided to

2672.16 --> 2679.44
stay stick strictly about

2675.7 --> 2679.4399999999996
educational subjects

2688.839 --> 2694.38
University level education does not work

2691.42 --> 2694.38
by learning by heart

2694.96 --> 2702.54
right just learning by heart is not

2697.359 --> 2705.4
sufficient you need to be able to defend

2702.54 --> 2709.839
improvisingly whatever you're learning

2705.4 --> 2711.4
even yeah so you learn how to defend the

2709.839 --> 2713.7999999999997
[ __ ]

2711.4 --> 2716.079
even if you find out it's [ __ ] you

2713.8 --> 2721.079
still have to defend it because in the

2716.079 --> 2721.079
University you can't actually criticize

2721.119 --> 2726.76
in a very serious fashion the material

2723.94 --> 2729.099
that you get to learn you can't

2726.76 --> 2730.3590000000004
criticize it even though it's a lot of

2729.099 --> 2732.339
people

2730.359 --> 2735.4
we'll probably have moments where

2732.339 --> 2737.859
they're like this is kind of wrong

2735.4 --> 2741.4
here's why

2737.859 --> 2744.0989999999997
but yeah it's integrated in the material

2741.4 --> 2747.9
so they don't like you to question

2744.099 --> 2747.9
things in University

2757.9 --> 2762.839
so yeah it's not just learning by heart

2760.06 --> 2765.04
you also have to defend

2762.839 --> 2766.18
improvisingly the things you learn by

2765.04 --> 2769.06
heart

2766.18 --> 2772.18
right but you can't actually criticize

2769.06 --> 2775.24
the material in itself you can't say

2772.18 --> 2778.2
this is bad we shouldn't be learning

2775.24 --> 2778.2
this here's why

2778.599 --> 2783.46
unless it's political [ __ ] and then

2781.3 --> 2787.8390000000004
it's okay

2783.46 --> 2789.88
because woke gets priority woke is

2787.839 --> 2791.859
allowed to erase whatever the [ __ ] it

2789.88 --> 2795.78
wants even if it makes no sense right

2791.859 --> 2799.9
but if it's actually technical in detail

2795.78 --> 2802.78
relevant to the entire field now please

2799.9 --> 2805.44
don't do that then right it makes it all

2802.78 --> 2805.44
confusing

2819.339 --> 2825.16
it's the point of the University

2820.8 --> 2827.079
questioning things is actually Paramount

2825.16 --> 2830.319
oh really

2827.079 --> 2832.96
except if you question like let's just

2830.319 --> 2835.3
say you go to

2832.96 --> 2838.839
Medical University

2835.3 --> 2842.2000000000003
and then you start to work on projects

2838.839 --> 2845.2599999999998
where you basically highlight exactly

2842.2 --> 2847.54
how allopathic medicine is an utter

2845.26 --> 2850.2400000000002
utter failure

2847.54 --> 2853.0
when it comes to

2850.24 --> 2855.7
Health Care

2853.0 --> 2857.8
right it's great in emergency procedures

2855.7 --> 2860.14
and accidents and

2857.8 --> 2863.559
that and it's great right

2860.14 --> 2866.2
emergency medicine allopathic medicine

2863.559 --> 2870.28
yeah it can work Health Care however

2866.2 --> 2872.5589999999997
it's terrible I'd like to see medical

2870.28 --> 2877.02
students in a university start about

2872.559 --> 2877.02
that let's see how well they do

2890.44 --> 2893.859
why the Don votes I just say that yeah

2892.66 --> 2896.02
that's just

2893.859 --> 2898.119
the conspiracy cats

2896.02 --> 2900.22
and I always get down folks you

2898.119 --> 2903.359
shouldn't even need to ask anymore I

2900.22 --> 2903.359
always get it it's fine

2905.02 --> 2909.04
a lot of people a lot of YouTubers turn

2907.66 --> 2911.92
off their votes because of this

2909.04 --> 2915.579
including extremely big channels

2911.92 --> 2920.64
I don't because I want to show

2915.579 --> 2920.6400000000003
just how bullshitty things going on are

2927.46 --> 2933.16
I appreciate that but yeah none of your

2929.88 --> 2935.92
upvotes will even show they'll just show

2933.16 --> 2939.16
that you upvoted to you

2935.92 --> 2941.38
but if like 50 people upvoted

2939.16 --> 2943.0589999999997
then you'll only still see like 10

2941.38 --> 2945.52
upvotes

2943.059 --> 2947.5
because they just you can all say like I

2945.52 --> 2949.72
did it I did it I did it's still not

2947.5 --> 2952.18
just gonna show they show you whatever

2949.72 --> 2954.8799999999997
they want to show you

2952.18 --> 2958.96
when it's rigged like that and my vote

2954.88 --> 2960.579
system on my shows are rigged like that

2958.96 --> 2963.16
they're rigged

2960.579 --> 2968.46
politically rigged very obviously in

2963.16 --> 2968.46
flow in flow chart standard fashion

2968.559 --> 2972.2400000000002
for spectrum dominance

2972.64 --> 2977.98
so they can maneuver

2974.92 --> 2979.599
your channel and your activities

2977.98 --> 2983.079
in whatever

2979.599 --> 2985.3
spectrum they want of everything of the

2983.079 --> 2989.819
millions and millions of videos they can

2985.3 --> 2989.819
just categorize it wherever they want it

2990.579 --> 2996.2200000000003
if they want in The Wider Spectrum your

2993.28 --> 2998.44
show to be disrespected then they will

2996.22 --> 3001.0789999999997
push it into the corner

2998.44 --> 3003.059
where you get all the symptoms of that

3001.079 --> 3004.92
you'll get all the trolls you'll get

3003.059 --> 3008.9
standard downfouch you'll get everything

3004.92 --> 3011.46
because they don't want you to be

3008.9 --> 3013.98
officially seen in a respected light

3011.46 --> 3016.44
that's what they do that's what YouTube

3013.98 --> 3018.72
does

3016.44 --> 3021.96
their manipulation

3018.72 --> 3024.18
compared to most things it's actually

3021.96 --> 3027.0
halfway subtle

3024.18 --> 3028.74
now of course the censorship the more

3027.0 --> 3031.14
overt censorship

3028.74 --> 3033.9599999999996
is not so subtle

3031.14 --> 3036.359
but where they how they upgrade or

3033.96 --> 3037.92
downgrade your channel activities that

3036.359 --> 3040.2599999999998
is very subtle

3037.92 --> 3043.5
you really have to catch on to that you

3040.26 --> 3046.38
really have to look more carefully

3043.5 --> 3049.74
like compare the actual details all the

3046.38 --> 3052.2000000000003
content and then cross reference it and

3049.74 --> 3054.4199999999996
then see like is this logical

3052.2 --> 3056.22
these amounts of subscribers the way the

3054.42 --> 3059.7000000000003
votes are arranged

3056.22 --> 3061.9199999999996
with the quality of the content and then

3059.7 --> 3064.74
you can see it

3061.92 --> 3066.98
then you can see like wow that makes no

3064.74 --> 3066.9799999999996
sense

3067.02 --> 3071.099
there's a channel out there has

3069.72 --> 3074.54
like

3071.099 --> 3074.54
much less videos

3075.599 --> 3081.1800000000003
not all that eloquent speaker not all

3078.48 --> 3084.079
that detailed information sure some

3081.18 --> 3087.54
production quality and they'll get

3084.079 --> 3091.079
thousands and thousands of upvotes and

3087.54 --> 3093.3
they'll get like

3091.079 --> 3096.96
a c

3093.3 --> 3100.7400000000002
of positive comments even though it was

3096.96 --> 3102.18
just pointless and only halfway amusing

3100.74 --> 3104.9399999999996
right

3102.18 --> 3108.18
it's because they're not a threat

3104.94 --> 3109.559
so they can flow to the top as much

3108.18 --> 3112.6189999999997
as

3109.559 --> 3114.78
the swarm of the entire car of all the

3112.619 --> 3117.2400000000002
people on YouTube will maneuver it

3114.78 --> 3119.52
naturally it will not be stopped

3117.24 --> 3124.04
from maneuvering outside of their

3119.52 --> 3124.04
containment position within the Spectrum

3125.099 --> 3130.38
because they're not a threat because

3127.2 --> 3134.64
it's just [ __ ] [ __ ] videos can

3130.38 --> 3137.6400000000003
rise to the top as much as they want

3134.64 --> 3141.66
but if it's a channel that actually

3137.64 --> 3144.5989999999997
makes points that are a threat

3141.66 --> 3149.339
to the system that promote critical

3144.599 --> 3153.48
thinking that draw Cornerstone

3149.339 --> 3155.52
assumed facts in doubt then

3153.48 --> 3156.72
then they don't allow you to float to

3155.52 --> 3160.5
the top

3156.72 --> 3164.66
then they continue then they make you

3160.5 --> 3164.66
pop up at troll channels

3168.42 --> 3173.94
they literally send in the trolls and

3170.7 --> 3177.859
they rake the votes and they just hope

3173.94 --> 3177.859
that you'll get sick of it and give up

3190.5 --> 3196.5
yes Thomas 8955 I know that that's why I

3194.52 --> 3199.44
distinguish the difference between their

3196.5 --> 3202.74
open censorship and

3199.44 --> 3205.92
the more subtle workings of

3202.74 --> 3208.68
attention Arrangement within all the

3205.92 --> 3210.1800000000003
videos on the platform

3208.68 --> 3213.74
right

3210.18 --> 3213.74
that part is more subtle

3222.839 --> 3225.98
okay Jason Brown

3227.819 --> 3232.14
thousands of likes and no views well

3229.74 --> 3235.74
those things are just block rigged and

3232.14 --> 3239.7
that is even like sort of legalized

3235.74 --> 3242.64
I think you can literally buy bots from

3239.7 --> 3244.3799999999997
Google themselves

3242.64 --> 3247.2
or like

3244.38 --> 3248.52
the corporations that are like condoned

3247.2 --> 3252.1189999999997
by Google

3248.52 --> 3258.319
to literally just give you votes

3252.119 --> 3258.319
to pile subscribers on for money

3258.599 --> 3264.839
you can buy your popularity

3262.319 --> 3268.079
I find it extremely repulsive and I've

3264.839 --> 3270.599
always rejected that oh and it's being

3268.079 --> 3271.8
offered on a weekly basis I get emails

3270.599 --> 3274.7400000000002
and [ __ ]

3271.8 --> 3277.8590000000004
constantly

3274.74 --> 3280.799
and I could do it it would just make me

3277.859 --> 3284.339
feel so stupid

3280.799 --> 3287.7599999999998
like oh I'm so I could never say again

3284.339 --> 3290.22
like I am big because I'm the best no it

3287.76 --> 3291.96
it's because I would know yeah I

3290.22 --> 3295.819
actually bought freaking subscribers

3291.96 --> 3295.819
this is totally pointless

3298.02 --> 3304.22
I almost took it Voynich it's been

3300.359 --> 3304.22
almost two case for a year

3308.04 --> 3313.619
like and still have the same same amount

3311.099 --> 3316.98
it's literally my subscribers have not

3313.619 --> 3319.38
changed in a month not a single one even

3316.98 --> 3321.119
though there's like now what is it 10

3319.38 --> 3324.0
new people that I've never seen before

3321.119 --> 3327.7200000000003
in my chat

3324.0 --> 3330.5
didn't gain a single subscriber just

3327.72 --> 3334.4599999999996
doesn't register it got

3330.5 --> 3334.46
1959 that's it

3348.48 --> 3353.059
it happens to everyone not everyone

3353.7 --> 3358.319
but

3354.96 --> 3360.839
most flat earthers yes does happen to

3358.319 --> 3363.079
most flat earthers on YouTube that's

3360.839 --> 3363.0789999999997
right

3371.28 --> 3375.619
you sub oh thanks man I appreciate that

3378.96 --> 3385.099
let me check if it registers then

3381.96 --> 3385.099
I already know it doesn't

3389.78 --> 3392.96
of course

3395.22 --> 3400.3799999999997
but it you know what is funny too about

3397.92 --> 3403.6800000000003
it about it right

3400.38 --> 3406.98
they literally tried to trick even me

3403.68 --> 3409.2599999999998
when I look like at the

3406.98 --> 3411.54
at the amount of subscribers and it says

3409.26 --> 3415.3190000000004
how many subscribers did you gain well

3411.54 --> 3418.5589999999997
it's been saying I gained 15 subscribers

3415.319 --> 3420.66
in the last month

3418.559 --> 3423.7400000000002
for a year

3420.66 --> 3423.74
a year

3423.96 --> 3429.54
15 Subs you just gained 15 subscribers

3426.599 --> 3432.599
this month for a year even though the

3429.54 --> 3434.72
entire year I'm stuck

3432.599 --> 3438.26
in between

3434.72 --> 3438.2599999999998
1955 and

3438.38 --> 3442.38
1959 subscribers

3446.94 --> 3450.96
so it's

3449.099 --> 3454.46
just rigged

3450.96 --> 3454.46
just rigged

3457.92 --> 3463.16
and I like to whine and complain about

3460.079 --> 3463.1600000000003
it every now and then

3467.16 --> 3474.18
I mean I'd really like

3471.0 --> 3476.599
Google to be made to surrender the

3474.18 --> 3476.5989999999997
platform

3476.76 --> 3481.1400000000003
to liberate it

3478.68 --> 3483.66
remember when YouTube used to be like

3481.14 --> 3485.16
really great

3483.66 --> 3487.799
fast

3485.16 --> 3490.46
and open

3487.799 --> 3490.46
crazy

3490.799 --> 3497.24
well where's that gone

3493.44 --> 3497.2400000000002
it's all gone to [ __ ]

3501.18 --> 3505.68
why because of the control because of

3504.18 --> 3507.839
the management

3505.68 --> 3510.72
because of the politicization because

3507.839 --> 3513.299
it's just completely corrupted I think

3510.72 --> 3515.64
that the YouTube as a platform should be

3513.299 --> 3520.28
surrendered to the public

3515.64 --> 3520.2799999999997
and in ways decentralized

3521.46 --> 3525.9
not in all ways because that would make

3523.799 --> 3528.42
it too complicated

3525.9 --> 3531.02
but yeah the way it's working currently

3528.42 --> 3531.02
I

3532.319 --> 3538.02
it's not gonna work

3535.38 --> 3539.04
eventually it'll just implode in on

3538.02 --> 3542.7599999999998
itself

3539.04 --> 3547.22
all right despite like the insane amount

3542.76 --> 3547.2200000000003
of videos that is all all here

3568.74 --> 3571.9399999999996
what are you talking to

3581.72 --> 3588.5
who are you talking to a return to

3583.98 --> 3588.5
normal who is this CPS

3588.66 --> 3595.7599999999998
oh wait way back I see it

3592.2 --> 3595.7599999999998
it's like from eight minutes ago

3609.059 --> 3611.2400000000002
foreign

3680.22 --> 3682.4599999999996
foreign

3690.9 --> 3693.9
foreign

3732.0 --> 3734.599
hmm

3756.24 --> 3758.4199999999996
foreign

3792.539 --> 3798.0200000000004
yeah you're not having a conversation

3794.819 --> 3798.02
like that in my chat

3815.7 --> 3819.72
oh

3817.92 --> 3821.64
yeah

3819.72 --> 3825.0589999999997
yeah CPS

3821.64 --> 3826.98
you do need to go [ __ ] yourself that's

3825.059 --> 3828.78
right

3826.98 --> 3830.819
I'll talk about flat earth when I'll

3828.78 --> 3833.4
talk about Flat Earth I started out

3830.819 --> 3836.22
talking about flatters Isle of Man was

3833.4 --> 3838.44
mentioned thanks to conspiracy cats and

3836.22 --> 3841.6189999999997
we do talk about it I just don't talk

3838.44 --> 3843.48
about it to our straight non-stop every

3841.619 --> 3846.599
single day

3843.48 --> 3850.859
for over 2 000 hours

3846.599 --> 3854.78
because I don't want to yeah I talk

3850.859 --> 3854.7799999999997
about whatever I want to talk about

3854.88 --> 3858.9
I'd like to talk about other things a

3856.92 --> 3860.76
lot

3858.9 --> 3863.339
I

3860.76 --> 3866.4
pretty much said everything I could ever

3863.339 --> 3868.619
think of concerning Flat Earth

3866.4 --> 3870.1800000000003
now if somebody has anything to ask

3868.619 --> 3873.42
about it

3870.18 --> 3877.5
or a challenge to make I'll take it

3873.42 --> 3881.099
but that doesn't mean that

3877.5 --> 3884.28
you can expect me to just start talking

3881.099 --> 3887.579
by myself about Flat Earth because I'm

3884.28 --> 3890.6400000000003
not obsessed with flat Earth

3887.579 --> 3893.099
I'm not obsessed with the fact that the

3890.64 --> 3896.42
Earth is flat

3893.099 --> 3900.42
and that the entire world is Spellbound

3896.42 --> 3902.64
to believe it's a ball and get really

3900.42 --> 3905.1800000000003
obsessed over that

3902.64 --> 3905.18
right

3905.76 --> 3911.8190000000004
I'm not obsessed

3908.039 --> 3912.8390000000004
with the lunatics that are obsessed with

3911.819 --> 3916.079
the ball

3912.839 --> 3917.22
I have to deal with them I can analyze

3916.079 --> 3919.319
them

3917.22 --> 3922.2599999999998
and I can even analyze how they think

3919.319 --> 3925.5
why they think I can freaking emulate it

3922.26 --> 3927.059
and I can even emulate acting like a

3925.5 --> 3930.059
baller better

3927.059 --> 3931.8590000000004
than the vast fast majority of actual

3930.059 --> 3935.76
believing ballers

3931.859 --> 3939.72
I'm a better baller than you

3935.76 --> 3944.8390000000004
I just don't actually believe it's real

3939.72 --> 3944.839
I understand that now took a while

3964.339 --> 3970.2
I could have explained it politely but

3967.14 --> 3972.9
yeah but that would not have addressed

3970.2 --> 3974.8799999999997
that it's a very whiny question

3972.9 --> 3977.2200000000003
why did you ever talk about Flat Earth

3974.88 --> 3979.38
yeah I am going to tell you to go [ __ ]

3977.22 --> 3981.72
yourself

3979.38 --> 3982.98
because that's just a whiny pointless

3981.72 --> 3985.2599999999998
question

3982.98 --> 3988.92
if you want me to talk about Flat Earth

3985.26 --> 3991.079
then talk about it then give me

3988.92 --> 3993.66
something to talk about or ask a

3991.079 --> 3998.2400000000002
question don't just come in complain I

3993.66 --> 3998.24
will never talk about it I'm sorry

3999.299 --> 4006.52
if you want me to talk about it I can

4002.539 --> 4006.5200000000004
gave me something to talk about it

4081.4 --> 4088.4
oh George Sanford technically well oh

4084.98 --> 4090.319
about the establishment of it being flat

4088.4 --> 4092.48
yeah there's not really that much to

4090.319 --> 4094.22
talk about concerning that

4092.48 --> 4097.94
however

4094.22 --> 4102.3189999999995
their actual parameters

4097.94 --> 4105.08
and the architecture of the realm

4102.319 --> 4107.659000000001
there is something there's still a lot

4105.08 --> 4111.8189999999995
of room to talk about problem is though

4107.659 --> 4111.8189999999995
is that we have very little data

4112.1 --> 4118.1
Beyond a certain point

4114.699 --> 4122.7789999999995
therefore every time

4118.1 --> 4125.659000000001
we wander Beyond those data limits it

4122.779 --> 4127.819
always becomes purely speculative

4125.659 --> 4130.159
and even though it can be very

4127.819 --> 4132.56
interesting and satisfying to speculate

4130.159 --> 4135.159
about what is beyond our data limit

4132.56 --> 4135.159000000001
reach

4137.839 --> 4145.159
doesn't really progress much it doesn't

4140.96 --> 4148.04
actually progress the data limit

4145.159 --> 4151.04
because you'd have to go out and

4148.04 --> 4153.94
actually explore and measure up and

4151.04 --> 4153.94
that's a bit of a problem

4157.1 --> 4160.1
foreign

4160.659 --> 4168.3189999999995
to normal I appreciate that yes

4165.04 --> 4170.9
Nathan is King of the tea bagging of tea

4168.319 --> 4174.38
bagging Ballers that's right

4170.9 --> 4176.7789999999995
and he really likes to keep this show

4174.38 --> 4178.759
about Flat Earth and the globers and the

4176.779 --> 4180.9800000000005
tea bagging that subsequently happens

4178.759 --> 4182.719
because of that

4180.98 --> 4184.8189999999995
that's right

4182.719 --> 4187.88
he doesn't typically like to address

4184.819 --> 4189.5
other subjects

4187.88 --> 4193.219
I

4189.5 --> 4195.679
address a lot of things I address a lot

4193.219 --> 4197.0
of psychological subjects cultural

4195.679 --> 4200.02
subjects

4197.0 --> 4203.179
societal development technological

4200.02 --> 4207.620000000001
development for society

4203.179 --> 4210.5
history everything basically

4207.62 --> 4212.36
the wide spectrum of interests and I can

4210.5 --> 4214.04
talk about a whole bunch of things and I

4212.36 --> 4218.679
even have my own

4214.04 --> 4218.679
unique I guess theories

4218.84 --> 4224.3
and they talk about the spiritual yeah

4221.06 --> 4228.5
all the subjects I know Nathan probably

4224.3 --> 4231.9400000000005
likes hearing about it and is interested

4228.5 --> 4231.94
he's just kind of still

4232.1 --> 4238.46
staring from in the tree you know that's

4234.86 --> 4239.659
not a saying in English it's

4238.46 --> 4242.36
like

4239.659 --> 4244.759999999999
he's interested but he doesn't really

4242.36 --> 4247.96
feel like talking about it except for

4244.76 --> 4250.46
the psychology of Ballers which I

4247.96 --> 4253.1
extensively talk about even on the Flat

4250.46 --> 4255.4
Earth debates and he has picked up on a

4253.1 --> 4255.400000000001
whole lot

4261.56 --> 4266.780000000001
right and he uses that it's irrelevant

4264.26 --> 4269.6
to literally the subjects

4266.78 --> 4273.82
that he deals with on the live show so

4269.6 --> 4273.820000000001
of course he expands upon that

4274.699 --> 4279.32
all right but over here I can talk about

4276.739 --> 4282.139999999999
anything and I talk about my own

4279.32 --> 4284.799999999999
freaking life details a lot even in

4282.14 --> 4284.8
bizarre

4285.199 --> 4290.86
extra dimensional spiritual senses and

4288.5 --> 4290.86
all that

4293.06 --> 4295.6
right

4295.699 --> 4301.759999999999
so I definitely go outside of the

4299.179 --> 4304.719
confines of just

4301.76 --> 4304.719
rigid

4305.38 --> 4309.88
natural world-based knowledge

4312.5 --> 4319.159
definitely one or Beyond I explore

4315.8 --> 4320.2390000000005
within the Ethereal and the esoteric a

4319.159 --> 4322.759999999999
lot

4320.239 --> 4325.239
because I see it as something that needs

4322.76 --> 4325.2390000000005
to be done

4325.64 --> 4330.56
for the entire psychological development

4328.219 --> 4333.679
of humanity because to get the weird

4330.56 --> 4336.14
sensation the more it is progressed the

4333.679 --> 4339.14
more it will actually imprint itself

4336.14 --> 4341.179
indirectly

4339.14 --> 4342.62
compared to the hundredth monkey effect

4341.179 --> 4344.06
I don't know if you heard of that

4342.62 --> 4346.64
concept

4344.06 --> 4349.280000000001
that through just the existing

4346.64 --> 4350.54
individual developing certain levels of

4349.28 --> 4354.08
insight

4350.54 --> 4357.0199999999995
climbing that staircase very far that it

4354.08 --> 4359.659
echoes on it imprints on The Wider world

4357.02 --> 4362.120000000001
as in the possibilities that people

4359.659 --> 4365.299999999999
suddenly throughout their life find

4362.12 --> 4367.88
available to them in their own psyche

4365.3 --> 4371.679
this is what I believe this is how I

4367.88 --> 4371.679
believe the Awakening actually works

4372.26 --> 4378.14
so you develop as an individual and now

4374.659 --> 4380.96
whether people Gaze on you in your

4378.14 --> 4382.820000000001
personal real physical natural world

4380.96 --> 4384.5
activities

4382.82 --> 4388.699
doesn't matter

4384.5 --> 4390.98
because we Echo all we do and our

4388.699 --> 4393.08
Spiritual Development

4390.98 --> 4394.639999999999
through the other dimension through the

4393.08 --> 4397.699
spirit world

4394.64 --> 4400.64
making that

4397.699 --> 4402.259999999999
level of staircase

4400.64 --> 4406.46
cleared up

4402.26 --> 4408.38
for people to see and be able to choose

4406.46 --> 4410.3
within their life even though they might

4408.38 --> 4413.719
have never heard of you never seen a

4410.3 --> 4416.3
single thing just by somebody out there

4413.719 --> 4418.82
that you don't have to know climbing

4416.3 --> 4420.56
that staircase within your spiritual

4418.82 --> 4424.34
personal life

4420.56 --> 4426.56
you might certainly see these levels

4424.34 --> 4429.56
available

4426.56 --> 4433.400000000001
revealed to you this is what I believe

4429.56 --> 4435.5
if no evidence for this but it is a

4433.4 --> 4438.199
pattern that I'm starting to figure out

4435.5 --> 4440.739
that I'm I'm starting to see these

4438.199 --> 4440.739
correlations

4442.64 --> 4447.58
and I'm feeling I got the Feeling

4444.44 --> 4447.58
there's something here

4447.98 --> 4454.9
it's becoming more palpable to me that

4450.56 --> 4454.900000000001
this may actually be a real effect

4455.42 --> 4460.6
because sometimes I just feel my own

4458.96 --> 4463.4
personal

4460.6 --> 4466.58
Ascension echoing out there

4463.4 --> 4468.199
I feel it echoing onto others even

4466.58 --> 4470.36
though I'm pretty sure that most of

4468.199 --> 4474.44
these people that I look at it don't

4470.36 --> 4477.759999999999
know who I am don't watch my show

4474.44 --> 4477.759999999999
still feel it

4506.17 --> 4510.55
[Music]

4536.36 --> 4541.0599999999995
yeah now time is a concept

4541.28 --> 4549.259999999999
it's a derived concept that we've

4545.719 --> 4552.159
attributed numerical values and

4549.26 --> 4552.159000000001
divisions too

4552.98 --> 4557.36
when the real division only really

4556.04 --> 4562.54
exists

4557.36 --> 4562.54
in the experience in the passage of time

4563.38 --> 4570.1990000000005
so the passage of time exists

4567.199 --> 4574.46
but time as an entity

4570.199 --> 4577.5199999999995
as a thing does not exist it's a derived

4574.46 --> 4579.679
concept based on the passage of time

4577.52 --> 4584.06
and

4579.679 --> 4586.64
the frequency of entropy

4584.06 --> 4588.9400000000005
the consistent frequency of entropy of

4586.64 --> 4588.9400000000005
matter

4620.179 --> 4624.04
okay the Big M

4624.44 --> 4627.099999999999
so

4658.46 --> 4664.159
where they called on you why did you

4662.06 --> 4670.0
steal something didn't you wear a mask

4664.159 --> 4670.0
and the people panicked can you please

4670.6 --> 4674.860000000001
that's some freaking context

4698.26 --> 4703.96
okay I've flatten the curve dude you

4701.48 --> 4703.959999999999
might wanna

4705.199 --> 4711.62
try to snap out of the addiction right

4709.159 --> 4713.0
constantly looking forward only thinking

4711.62 --> 4716.54
about

4713.0 --> 4718.52
right that's problematic

4716.54 --> 4722.3
the longing

4718.52 --> 4724.820000000001
really is the effective addiction right

4722.3 --> 4728.06
if you have that constantly even at

4724.82 --> 4730.159
extremely inappropriate times that mean

4728.06 --> 4733.42
you might be an alcoholic

4730.159 --> 4733.42
be careful if I were you

4745.34 --> 4751.1
you never used to drink well

4747.98 --> 4753.199
doesn't really matter dude you can

4751.1 --> 4755.780000000001
become an alcoholic

4753.199 --> 4758.54
when you're 60 even though you've never

4755.78 --> 4760.34
touched a drop of alcohol yeah it

4758.54 --> 4764.38
doesn't really matter when you start to

4760.34 --> 4764.38
drink you can become an alcoholic

4765.92 --> 4768.6990000000005
so

4769.28 --> 4773.0199999999995
I'd be careful if I were you

4778.64 --> 4782.54
always hate it yeah and now you don't

4780.679 --> 4784.28
and now you risk of becoming an

4782.54 --> 4786.86
alcoholic so

4784.28 --> 4789.679
stop saying but it never used to be like

4786.86 --> 4793.0
this yeah it is now though

4789.679 --> 4793.0
by your own description

4799.84 --> 4803.5
all right yeah

4809.659 --> 4815.719
yeah that's the whole point of alcohol

4812.239 --> 4818.199
yeah it can be very enjoyable hey I

4815.719 --> 4820.04
still drink my beers

4818.199 --> 4823.759999999999
but

4820.04 --> 4826.1
if I'd be thinking about I want my beer

4823.76 --> 4827.659000000001
I want my beer I want my beer like in

4826.1 --> 4830.179
the entire evening

4827.659 --> 4833.12
and the night and the mornings and

4830.179 --> 4835.659
during my show then I'd realize I'd have

4833.12 --> 4835.659
a problem

4835.88 --> 4840.8
because I'm constantly like longing

4838.46 --> 4842.78
that's addiction

4840.8 --> 4845.78
I don't have that

4842.78 --> 4848.54
thank God I don't and I'm very careful

4845.78 --> 4851.42
not to let that slip in if it were ever

4848.54 --> 4853.9
the case that I start to get longings

4851.42 --> 4853.9
like that

4854.0 --> 4859.76
and that's why I allow myself to keep

4856.6 --> 4863.42
drinking like the same amount in the

4859.76 --> 4865.6990000000005
same time period And I am enjoying that

4863.42 --> 4868.219
if I certainly got a lot of impulses

4865.699 --> 4870.5599999999995
that I'm addicted because I'm like

4868.219 --> 4872.179
constantly wanting it yeah then I got a

4870.56 --> 4874.6990000000005
problem

4872.179 --> 4877.52
then I'll have to do something about it

4874.699 --> 4881.0599999999995
because constantly longing for alcohol

4877.52 --> 4883.580000000001
or and or being constantly drunk is a

4881.06 --> 4885.38
severe strain on your body and on your

4883.58 --> 4888.92
spirit

4885.38 --> 4891.7390000000005
it will erode your spirit you will be

4888.92 --> 4895.219
cut literally become less

4891.739 --> 4898.879999999999
your spirit will degrade

4895.219 --> 4902.2390000000005
palpably you will lose

4898.88 --> 4904.76
the edge of your faculties and your body

4902.239 --> 4906.86
is going to wear out and become very

4904.76 --> 4909.860000000001
toxified most of the time you will

4906.86 --> 4911.96
become more vulnerable to sickness for

4909.86 --> 4916.48
all sorts

4911.96 --> 4916.4800000000005
so yeah don't do that

4938.12 --> 4943.34
dude that's fine

4941.3 --> 4946.0
I'm just trying to warn you ahead of

4943.34 --> 4949.58
time yeah you know why I do it now

4946.0 --> 4951.86
because you're really really enjoying it

4949.58 --> 4953.42
you just said it like I'm so enjoying

4951.86 --> 4956.599999999999
this yeah

4953.42 --> 4960.56
but hey you are actually longing for it

4956.6 --> 4963.5
in very unusual times that's a worrying

4960.56 --> 4966.7390000000005
element you should be

4963.5 --> 4971.26
taking some gas off

4966.739 --> 4971.259999999999
you know take some pressure off stop

4971.62 --> 4978.62
designing your day around this or you'll

4975.199 --> 4982.12
get into very serious trouble

4978.62 --> 4982.12
trying to help you out here

4986.48 --> 4991.12
I'm not telling you you can't enjoy a

4989.3 --> 4993.02
drink

4991.12 --> 4995.32
periodically

4993.02 --> 4998.84
I'm just saying if you're going to

4995.32 --> 5001.84
notice you are starting to obsess over

4998.84 --> 5004.54
it and longing for it constantly then

5001.84 --> 5007.96
you are building alcoholism you don't

5004.54 --> 5011.139
want to let that happen even though you

5007.96 --> 5014.34
seem to be enjoying the moment a lot I'm

5011.139 --> 5014.34
trying to warn you here

5028.3 --> 5034.4400000000005
okay well I dude don't tell me I didn't

5031.96 --> 5034.44
warn you

5052.44 --> 5061.138999999999
cortisol yeah cortisol look all all the

5056.62 --> 5061.139
pharmacy drugs are all pretty risky

5067.42 --> 5071.02
look flatten the Curve

5069.52 --> 5073.120000000001
dude

5071.02 --> 5077.46
I don't care yeah

5073.12 --> 5077.46
I don't care if you're not gonna listen

5078.34 --> 5084.400000000001
dude just enjoy your life while it lasts

5082.659 --> 5088.0599999999995
why you still can

5084.4 --> 5090.4
and stop talking about it yeah

5088.06 --> 5093.34
I don't care for your

5090.4 --> 5095.62
alcohol habits

5093.34 --> 5097.860000000001
if you're not going to do anything about

5095.62 --> 5097.86
it

5111.5 --> 5114.63
[Music]

5117.69 --> 5121.089999999999
[Music]

5155.8 --> 5159.400000000001
all right meantime

5159.94 --> 5167.58
my other chat participants are talking

5162.4 --> 5167.58
about totally different things of course

5226.719 --> 5230.8
yeah flatten the curve why don't you

5228.52 --> 5234.42
give it some more time and we'll see

5230.8 --> 5234.42
about the zero effects

5263.86 --> 5268.42
if you don't have hangovers after

5265.84 --> 5269.9800000000005
drinking you have a pro well then I'd

5268.42 --> 5272.02
have a problem because I don't have

5269.98 --> 5274.0599999999995
hangovers after drinking

5272.02 --> 5279.06
then again I don't really drink that

5274.06 --> 5279.06
much now I do still very much feel it

5280.84 --> 5284.82
like when I drink

5285.159 --> 5292.42
but as long as I don't like

5288.34 --> 5295.78
go too far drink too much then

5292.42 --> 5298.179
I literally do not have hangovers ever

5295.78 --> 5299.5
now but then again I don't really drink

5298.179 --> 5304.02
late

5299.5 --> 5304.02
I drink in the afternoon evening

5305.62 --> 5311.94
so that would by the time I go to bed

5308.98 --> 5316.0
all of the ALCO is already

5311.94 --> 5317.86
processed by my liver and out of my

5316.0 --> 5319.239
system

5317.86 --> 5321.099999999999
because

5319.239 --> 5323.799999999999
yeah sleeping

5321.1 --> 5327.42
while having alcohol in your system is

5323.8 --> 5327.42
actually really bad for you

5333.34 --> 5338.679
because it disturbs the Regeneration

5336.159 --> 5341.259999999999
cycle that specifically takes place

5338.679 --> 5343.92
during sleep right that's why you

5341.26 --> 5343.92
shouldn't do that

5348.699 --> 5350.879999999999
foreign

5368.82 --> 5374.86
okay well

5371.92 --> 5376.84
as long as you don't get more and more

5374.86 --> 5378.82
and more and realize that it is

5376.84 --> 5380.9800000000005
inevitable if you do this periodically

5378.82 --> 5382.659
like I have because I've been doing this

5380.98 --> 5386.199
for now two years

5382.659 --> 5389.0199999999995
every day right without working out just

5386.199 --> 5392.199
fine until that time where I decide to

5389.02 --> 5394.6
open a bad bottle

5392.199 --> 5397.54
with not just regular beer but other

5394.6 --> 5401.7390000000005
stuff that's when I get the problems

5397.54 --> 5403.48
but yeah once you get used to drinking

5401.739 --> 5406.299999999999
every day

5403.48 --> 5408.5199999999995
limited amounts eventually you will

5406.3 --> 5409.96
start to like be seduced and live and

5408.52 --> 5410.9800000000005
long for you like maybe I get a little

5409.96 --> 5412.84
more

5410.98 --> 5414.82
maybe a little more yeah if you

5412.84 --> 5417.400000000001
constantly give in to that that's when

5414.82 --> 5420.58
you're totally [ __ ]

5417.4 --> 5422.799999999999
because then over time slowly you'll

5420.58 --> 5425.92
start to drink more and more and more

5422.8 --> 5428.28
and it feels the same but the punishment

5425.92 --> 5431.02
on your body is not the same it it

5428.28 --> 5434.38
increases and just because you don't

5431.02 --> 5436.540000000001
notice does it mean the damage isn't

5434.38 --> 5441.6990000000005
being done

5436.54 --> 5445.48
right now I very strictly keep it

5441.699 --> 5449.4
to the amount to a certain numeric value

5445.48 --> 5449.4
and I don't move Beyond it

5451.12 --> 5456.0599999999995
and it works great

5452.92 --> 5456.06
not getting sick

5459.639 --> 5466.679
not every day just when I mean do you

5461.98 --> 5466.678999999999
have a pool in your garden right so

5482.98 --> 5486.4
ha

5484.06 --> 5489.06
that's a funny one Daffy Duck I actually

5486.4 --> 5489.0599999999995
did that

5490.6 --> 5495.9400000000005
because I had stopped smoking like a

5493.6 --> 5498.6
whole while ago that's like in 20

5495.94 --> 5498.599999999999
somewhere

5499.139 --> 5504.9400000000005
beginning of this

5502.179 --> 5507.639
this century

5504.94 --> 5510.659
and I mostly just long to have something

5507.639 --> 5510.659000000001
like in there

5512.98 --> 5519.0599999999995
and I'd have cigarettes

5515.26 --> 5519.06
and then just not light them up

5521.56 --> 5525.88
it's like yeah I'm going to smoke

5523.84 --> 5528.04
something and then I just never light it

5525.88 --> 5529.4800000000005
up and then after like half an hour of

5528.04 --> 5531.28
sitting there like that I'd like okay

5529.48 --> 5534.04
and I'll put it back again

5531.28 --> 5537.78
it surprisingly does work if you can

5534.04 --> 5537.78
manage to not light it up

5542.739 --> 5548.739
isn't the recommended amount that

5545.98 --> 5550.839999999999
dude that completely depends on the

5548.739 --> 5553.98
individual

5550.84 --> 5553.9800000000005
their metabolism

5554.92 --> 5558.82
right

5556.3 --> 5562.3
how sensitive you are

5558.82 --> 5565.179
and how quickly like addictive responses

5562.3 --> 5567.820000000001
start to arise like so that completely

5565.179 --> 5570.719
is different per individual

5567.82 --> 5570.719
return to normal

5579.219 --> 5584.44
the cigarettes are my downfall Maybe

5582.76 --> 5586.96
oh dude

5584.44 --> 5590.62
what about it exactly is your downfall

5586.96 --> 5591.639
because yeah regular cigarettes are

5590.62 --> 5593.8
terrible

5591.639 --> 5596.38
they're very toxic they they put

5593.8 --> 5597.88
chemicals in them and the filters are

5596.38 --> 5601.12
[ __ ]

5597.88 --> 5606.1
it's industrial standard [ __ ]

5601.12 --> 5607.36
right so I wouldn't light up a cigarette

5606.1 --> 5610.06
ever

5607.36 --> 5613.0599999999995
I'll never do that again ever it's been

5610.06 --> 5615.6990000000005
a long time anyway but

5613.06 --> 5618.159000000001
if you like really put a little bit more

5615.699 --> 5619.78
effort into it then

5618.159 --> 5622.719
I got my

5619.78 --> 5624.88
tobacco leaves Raw

5622.719 --> 5629.58
and unprocessed

5624.88 --> 5629.58
from the United States right remember

5630.46 --> 5635.139
big bag

5632.44 --> 5639.28
well

5635.139 --> 5644.26
since I transitioned into smoking that

5639.28 --> 5648.0
I've had a lot less negative influences

5644.26 --> 5651.34
from it less lung problems less

5648.0 --> 5653.56
nasal problems like

5651.34 --> 5656.02
better for my mouth it's better for

5653.56 --> 5658.900000000001
everything because I think that tobacco

5656.02 --> 5661.780000000001
really isn't the toxic Factor as much as

5658.9 --> 5664.0
it is the processing that has been done

5661.78 --> 5665.32
with cigarettes with industrialized

5664.0 --> 5668.739
cigarettes

5665.32 --> 5671.799999999999
they specifically are the issue

5668.739 --> 5674.159
the industrialized processes make it

5671.8 --> 5674.159000000001
toxic

5676.9 --> 5683.379999999999
but if you literally just do it the

5679.84 --> 5685.0
oldest fashion way the Indian way you

5683.38 --> 5686.219
could say the old Native American way

5685.0 --> 5689.92
just

5686.219 --> 5692.56
actual plant dried leaves you have to

5689.92 --> 5695.9800000000005
cut it up yourself you it it takes a

5692.56 --> 5698.38
little bit more effort but it's it's a

5695.98 --> 5699.82
world of difference that's what I

5698.38 --> 5703.119
figured out

5699.82 --> 5704.38
I heard smoking weed is out well yeah I

5703.119 --> 5707.679
combine it

5704.38 --> 5709.6
right but some people don't like smoking

5707.679 --> 5711.82
weed without tobacco I am one of those

5709.6 --> 5715.06
people

5711.82 --> 5716.98
right but thank God I just use raw

5715.06 --> 5719.320000000001
tobacco leaves now and no more

5716.98 --> 5722.32
industrially

5719.32 --> 5722.32
produced

5722.92 --> 5731.139
cigarettes and all that

5726.219 --> 5733.619
it is a big big difference guys it

5731.139 --> 5733.619
really is

5735.58 --> 5739.719
if you've seen any Terence and Hill

5737.5 --> 5741.219
butts but no I haven't looked for that

5739.719 --> 5743.7390000000005
kiwi gammer

5741.219 --> 5746.38
but if I wanted to see

5743.739 --> 5748.0
four-fifths of the devil movies I just

5746.38 --> 5749.9800000000005
download them

5748.0 --> 5752.38
or I'd look them up on YouTube because

5749.98 --> 5754.48
they're very old I don't think they're

5752.38 --> 5756.28
they even have any more

5754.48 --> 5759.699
license

5756.28 --> 5761.8
copyright stuff to them tight they're

5759.699 --> 5764.759999999999
like public domain now so you could just

5761.8 --> 5764.76
look it up on YouTube

5788.38 --> 5791.04
hmm

5798.34 --> 5805.659000000001
I just Vape well Vape isn't really all

5802.3 --> 5809.1
that great either return to normal

5805.659 --> 5809.099999999999
has its own issues

5810.219 --> 5814.56
its own health risks separate

5815.08 --> 5820.119
I think that

5816.699 --> 5824.46
I wouldn't really know how to compare it

5820.119 --> 5828.42
it's just that I'd probably take a vape

5824.46 --> 5831.639
tobacco situation over regular

5828.42 --> 5836.219
industrialized cigarettes

5831.639 --> 5836.219
but I'd prefer not to do either

5836.5 --> 5840.6
yeah Vape is not all that great

5867.58 --> 5874.199
whoa

5869.88 --> 5877.92
that is I hate that

5874.199 --> 5877.919999999999
Amnesia is the worst

5879.58 --> 5886.739
I'd like to avoid that strain as much as

5883.0 --> 5886.739
I can I think it's terrible

5886.78 --> 5891.0599999999995
it's really bad for the cognition

5896.739 --> 5902.919999999999
dude it's literally called Amnesia you

5901.06 --> 5905.1
think that that's a joke

5902.92 --> 5905.1
foreign

5907.719 --> 5913.139
and I have smoked it in the past I don't

5910.179 --> 5913.139
like it at all

5927.219 --> 5929.94
amen

5930.34 --> 5934.96
yeah I don't know why we're all talking

5932.02 --> 5937.06
about alcohol and weed and tobacco now

5934.96 --> 5939.42
but I guess it was time to talk about

5937.06 --> 5939.42
that

5939.94 --> 5942.659
ah

5943.96 --> 5950.9800000000005
right if you're really young don't do it

5946.78 --> 5954.34
just really really don't it sucks and

5950.98 --> 5956.339999999999
the people you would do it with suck

5954.34 --> 5959.38
you have friends

5956.34 --> 5964.56
that like to smoke and drink and yeah

5959.38 --> 5964.56
get the [ __ ] away from them I mean it

5964.659 --> 5969.759999999999
I had those types of friends yeah you

5968.139 --> 5973.06
know what happened to the guy that

5969.76 --> 5975.400000000001
actually rolled me into smoking cannabis

5973.06 --> 5978.04
and tobacco and [ __ ]

5975.4 --> 5980.08
he literally ended up in a crack house

5978.04 --> 5982.719
he barely survived that [ __ ] because

5980.08 --> 5985.42
yeah there was nothing stopping him I

5982.719 --> 5987.58
didn't go that far thank God I never

5985.42 --> 5991.3
went beyond cannabis because as soon as

5987.58 --> 5994.0599999999995
my parents figured out like wait

5991.3 --> 5996.04
smoking they could see it because they

5994.06 --> 5998.6990000000005
are cannabis smoke they were cannabis

5996.04 --> 5998.699
but my dad was

5999.82 --> 6003.96
dead so they recognized then they said

6001.32 --> 6006.239
okay we'll just you just do that here

6003.96 --> 6009.2390000000005
don't go out there and

6006.239 --> 6010.799999999999
do drugs with weirdos and people that

6009.239 --> 6013.5599999999995
are sliding

6010.8 --> 6016.02
and yeah I'm very happy that I followed

6013.56 --> 6017.820000000001
that I actually went with that because

6016.02 --> 6018.84
the guy ended up in a freaking crack

6017.82 --> 6022.38
house

6018.84 --> 6026.46
literally smoking crack and stealing car

6022.38 --> 6029.82
radios and [ __ ] he got out of it again

6026.46 --> 6031.8
which is pretty remarkable because once

6029.82 --> 6034.679
you go there you usually don't get back

6031.8 --> 6036.54
except in a coffin

6034.679 --> 6038.34
but he did get out of it and then he

6036.54 --> 6040.04
went into

6038.34 --> 6043.5
uh

6040.04 --> 6045.36
Scientology that was weird

6043.5 --> 6048.0
but yeah I never really

6045.36 --> 6050.4
I wasn't in contact with him after that

6048.0 --> 6052.92
but I did hear about this

6050.4 --> 6055.138999999999
like in my 20s

6052.92 --> 6057.86
that that had happened to him

6055.139 --> 6057.86
weird stuff

6059.34 --> 6064.26
right so if you're a kid if you're like

6061.619 --> 6066.0599999999995
12 and you're watching this channel yeah

6064.26 --> 6068.1
oh we're talking about cannabis alcohol

6066.06 --> 6071.280000000001
it's not cool

6068.1 --> 6073.8
if you're a kid don't [ __ ] do it I

6071.28 --> 6076.44
mean it don't do it it'll totally

6073.8 --> 6078.84
overwhelm you it'll [ __ ] with your

6076.44 --> 6081.419999999999
development your mental growth maybe

6078.84 --> 6082.860000000001
even your physical metabolism

6081.42 --> 6085.92
right it's not going to be as bad as

6082.86 --> 6087.9
like taking vaccine crap or whatever

6085.92 --> 6090.2390000000005
that's even worse

6087.9 --> 6093.0
just don't do drugs when you're really

6090.239 --> 6095.599999999999
young like if you're really Gonna Roll

6093.0 --> 6095.6

6096.54 --> 6102.6
like

6098.34 --> 6106.02
do it like 16 or 17 or something right

6102.6 --> 6108.719
trigger insist because you're always

6106.02 --> 6112.38
everybody always ends up doing it before

6108.719 --> 6114.719
it's legal with their age everybody does

6112.38 --> 6117.4800000000005

6172.98 --> 6180.678999999999
worst drug right so don't go

6176.82 --> 6182.219
when you're a kid you're in between 12

6180.679 --> 6184.619
16.

6182.219 --> 6185.76
don't go do

6184.619 --> 6188.759999999999
like

6185.76 --> 6192.6
cannabis or alcohol [ __ ]

6188.76 --> 6196.26
but also don't start eating twinkies and

6192.6 --> 6197.639
[ __ ] and bags of Doritos

6196.26 --> 6202.280000000001
and

6197.639 --> 6204.84
like Red Bull energy drink like don't

6202.28 --> 6208.259999999999
[ __ ] do that

6204.84 --> 6210.2390000000005
yeah you can avoid all the drugs you

6208.26 --> 6212.639
want your entire life if you're gonna

6210.239 --> 6215.159
take that crap especially at a young age

6212.639 --> 6218.58
guess what's gonna happen you're gonna

6215.159 --> 6221.78
bloat up and become a fat

6218.58 --> 6221.78
ugly piece of [ __ ]

6222.78 --> 6228.3
it's not a guarantee by the way some

6224.58 --> 6231.0599999999995
don't go bloody fat but

6228.3 --> 6234.659000000001
a lot do

6231.06 --> 6239.52
because it [ __ ] you up energy drink

6234.659 --> 6242.719
cheap ass prefab candy food

6239.52 --> 6248.580000000001
it really messes you up McDonald's

6242.719 --> 6251.34
avoided at all cost like mac like

6248.58 --> 6253.92
eating McDonald's is literally on the

6251.34 --> 6256.679
level of like injecting yourself with

6253.92 --> 6259.38
poison it is so incredibly unhealthy

6256.679 --> 6262.02
especially when you're young don't ever

6259.38 --> 6265.619
eat there ever

6262.02 --> 6270.119000000001
McDonald's shouldn't exist the entire

6265.619 --> 6273.239
company should like be totally shut down

6270.119 --> 6275.4
like the amount of Health damage that

6273.239 --> 6278.339999999999
entire [ __ ] company has done to the

6275.4 --> 6282.44
world is mind-numbing

6278.34 --> 6282.4400000000005
never eat that [ __ ]

6285.78 --> 6289.92
right but don't eat like candy crap

6288.719 --> 6291.719
either

6289.92 --> 6293.219
when you're young

6291.719 --> 6295.02
it's bad

6293.219 --> 6298.56
don't

6295.02 --> 6301.860000000001
if anything try to get yourself addicted

6298.56 --> 6304.02
to health food sounds bizarre right and

6301.86 --> 6305.699
think oh healthy food and creams I don't

6304.02 --> 6307.92
like it yeah as a kid you might be like

6305.699 --> 6310.0199999999995
ah Mommy I don't want to

6307.92 --> 6312.4800000000005
I don't like vegetables well guess what

6310.02 --> 6314.34
when you're a little older

6312.48 --> 6317.759999999999
you might find that

6314.34 --> 6319.8
there is actually really nice organic

6317.76 --> 6321.719
health food out there

6319.8 --> 6324.96
get used to that

6321.719 --> 6327.119
you if you get addicted to that

6324.96 --> 6331.5
you will

6327.119 --> 6336.0599999999995
get out of it a lot better just don't

6331.5 --> 6337.739
at a very young age go vegan and [ __ ]

6336.06 --> 6341.52
don't do that

6337.739 --> 6344.339999999999
unless well your family is very

6341.52 --> 6347.040000000001
conscious about food and they kind of

6344.34 --> 6350.219
know about their lineage like yeah we

6347.04 --> 6354.36
don't do well with me

6350.219 --> 6357.3
right so don't go vegan just because you

6354.36 --> 6359.9
want to go get health food

6357.3 --> 6359.900000000001
just

6360.78 --> 6365.82
eat healthy very young and the rewards

6363.9 --> 6369.54
for the rest of your life will be

6365.82 --> 6371.58
incredible you will be so happy that you

6369.54 --> 6373.8
did that when you were young

6371.58 --> 6376.28
so happy

6373.8 --> 6376.28
okay

6377.52 --> 6383.34
I wish I had

6380.219 --> 6385.56
but my parents did give me pretty

6383.34 --> 6387.719
healthy food

6385.56 --> 6390.3
gave me a lot of greens I really hated

6387.719 --> 6392.34
them but then I kind of like was

6390.3 --> 6394.02
reminded very early like yes it's really

6392.34 --> 6396.119000000001
healthy it's really healthy it's really

6394.02 --> 6400.1990000000005
healthy so I just conditioned myself

6396.119 --> 6402.839999999999
like I love this salad I love it I know

6400.199 --> 6405.0
it tastes disgusting but I love it

6402.84 --> 6407.34
because I know it's healthy and then

6405.0 --> 6409.619
literally the knowing it's healthy made

6407.34 --> 6412.08
it taste better over time and I still

6409.619 --> 6414.9
enjoy it now

6412.08 --> 6418.26
right unfortunately though I was really

6414.9 --> 6420.54
candy addicted when I was a kid in ways

6418.26 --> 6422.04
I still am I just don't buy candy

6420.54 --> 6424.44
anymore

6422.04 --> 6427.38
and when I do I get like a bag of

6424.44 --> 6430.259999999999
Licorice and then I eat the whole

6427.38 --> 6433.4400000000005
[ __ ] bag in an hour

6430.26 --> 6436.5
that's the problem that remains from my

6433.44 --> 6439.678999999999
youth I did that [ __ ] buy a bag of chips

6436.5 --> 6442.02
way too big eat it all until I literally

6439.679 --> 6444.78
had to puke it up again I was that

6442.02 --> 6448.38
freaking candy addicted okay

6444.78 --> 6451.5599999999995
and I have prayed a physical price for

6448.38 --> 6454.02
that not that I got fat and [ __ ]

6451.56 --> 6455.88
because I didn't eat I didn't do it

6454.02 --> 6458.639
constantly didn't constantly stuff

6455.88 --> 6461.159000000001
myself forward when when I ate Candy or

6458.639 --> 6463.5
chips I would always eat way too much in

6461.159 --> 6466.32
a single time and get sick of it and

6463.5 --> 6470.52
then just not want it for a Time

6466.32 --> 6473.94
but all those toxins have actually

6470.52 --> 6476.400000000001
born on my average health

6473.94 --> 6478.5599999999995
if I hadn't done that when I was younger

6476.4 --> 6480.619
then I wouldn't have been as exposed to

6478.56 --> 6483.179
MSG

6480.619 --> 6485.5199999999995
monosodium glutamates

6483.179 --> 6487.32
flavor enhancers chemical flavor

6485.52 --> 6488.46
enhances if I hadn't been exposed to it

6487.32 --> 6490.98
as much

6488.46 --> 6493.9800000000005
my health would probably be better now

6490.98 --> 6496.739
if I hadn't done all that if I hadn't

6493.98 --> 6498.599999999999
indulged it if my parents had basically

6496.739 --> 6500.699
just said no you are not allowed to do

6498.6 --> 6504.54
that I wish now my parents had said

6500.699 --> 6506.339999999999
you're not allowed to do that and I

6504.54 --> 6507.679
would have been yeah but I didn't want

6506.34 --> 6510.42
to do it

6507.679 --> 6514.4400000000005
slap me

6510.42 --> 6516.54
screw that don't [ __ ] poison yourself

6514.44 --> 6519.08
don't allow your kids to poison

6516.54 --> 6519.08
themselves

6519.659 --> 6523.699
is Nathan actually live not yet

6524.52 --> 6529.34
it is live Monday to Friday flatten the

6527.1 --> 6529.34
Curve

6551.52 --> 6556.080000000001
that's right

6553.38 --> 6558.119
coffee weed Alcohol Tobacco yeah that's

6556.08 --> 6561.599
pretty average package

6558.119 --> 6564.299999999999
be very careful with both the coffee and

6561.599 --> 6567.96
the alcohol though

6564.3 --> 6570.54
too much coffee is also very bad for

6567.96 --> 6573.119
your liver

6570.54 --> 6575.46
like technically drinking coffee isn't

6573.119 --> 6578.5199999999995
really healthy at all it rubs your

6575.46 --> 6581.4
system of minerals every time you drink

6578.52 --> 6585.119000000001
coffee your entire body

6581.4 --> 6586.739
starts to eject minerals on a cellular

6585.119 --> 6589.5599999999995
level

6586.739 --> 6590.459999999999
and then eventually it'll get reabsorbed

6589.56 --> 6593.46
again

6590.46 --> 6596.28
but if you constantly drink coffee then

6593.46 --> 6598.679
you will end up actually ejecting a lot

6596.28 --> 6601.44
of good nourishment from your body and

6598.679 --> 6604.38
just pissing it out

6601.44 --> 6607.138999999999
so be very careful with coffee addiction

6604.38 --> 6610.5
it is like actually being addicted to

6607.139 --> 6612.96
coffee might be like just as hazardous

6610.5 --> 6613.86
for your health as being addicted to

6612.96 --> 6615.36
alcohol

6613.86 --> 6617.159
serious

6615.36 --> 6620.5199999999995
be very careful

6617.159 --> 6624.719
like I'm very careful with

6620.52 --> 6628.02
with coffee I only drink One Max

6624.719 --> 6630.78
absolute Max two cups a day is that if I

6628.02 --> 6633.320000000001
drink more I literally start to get like

6630.78 --> 6633.32
pain

6633.36 --> 6638.94
coffee is not great

6635.82 --> 6641.159
even though I have organic brand coffee

6638.94 --> 6644.159
I put some

6641.159 --> 6647.239
turmeric in it

6644.159 --> 6647.239
to boost it up

6647.88 --> 6654.2390000000005
I can't drink coffee constantly if just

6650.82 --> 6657.599
imagining drinking six cups of coffee in

6654.239 --> 6660.54
a day I would literally become like

6657.599 --> 6663.599
really severely ill if I started doing

6660.54 --> 6665.82
that severely ill potentially like

6663.599 --> 6667.38
having to go to the hospital at some

6665.82 --> 6670.86
point if I did that

6667.38 --> 6673.32
right now has to do with my metabolism I

6670.86 --> 6675.78
just can't take it as much but even if

6673.32 --> 6678.48
your liver and your body can take that

6675.78 --> 6681.659
much coffee constantly drinking coffee

6678.48 --> 6684.78
doesn't matter how strong you are

6681.659 --> 6686.638999999999
it has a detriment it's never good for

6684.78 --> 6689.58
you

6686.639 --> 6693.02
it wears on you coffee wears on your

6689.58 --> 6693.0199999999995
body it's not healthy

6698.34 --> 6702.9800000000005
yeah and you can get blood pressure

6699.9 --> 6702.98
issues among other

6707.58 --> 6711.9
they have two during my show well okay

6709.739 --> 6714.0599999999995
what's up to you I'm just I'm just

6711.9 --> 6716.28
telling you

6714.06 --> 6719.280000000001
there is no substance you can just take

6716.28 --> 6722.04
unlimitedly right

6719.28 --> 6724.139
except maybe water like yeah you can

6722.04 --> 6727.139
stop but technically you can have water

6724.139 --> 6729.599
poisoning and it's pretty ridiculous you

6727.139 --> 6731.159000000001
can drink water all day

6729.599 --> 6733.679
that's about it

6731.159 --> 6735.0
like you can't even drink like unlimited

6733.679 --> 6739.4
tea

6735.0 --> 6739.4
then similar problems set in

6739.619 --> 6745.5599999999995
like whatever you're gonna take Limited

6743.099 --> 6746.6990000000005
always Limited

6745.56 --> 6749.099
critical

6746.699 --> 6751.5599999999995
there's nothing that you can take in

6749.099 --> 6755.76
this world Unlimited

6751.56 --> 6759.599
there is no Unlimited in this realm

6755.76 --> 6763.34
you understand none there's no Unlimited

6759.599 --> 6763.34
in the realm in any form

6765.78 --> 6771.199
there's always a limit to everything

6768.179 --> 6771.1990000000005
everything physical

6781.86 --> 6785.78
is that the real Eric Dubai

6787.92 --> 6792.119
might be I'm talking about eating

6790.38 --> 6796.28
healthy and all that although I did

6792.119 --> 6796.28
recommend against vegan earlier

6798.139 --> 6801.86
is that the real you

6805.619 --> 6809.759999999999
huh

6807.239 --> 6812.659
well if it is welcome to the early bird

6809.76 --> 6812.659000000001
show in chat

6813.06 --> 6819.8
I I didn't know you actually appreciated

6815.52 --> 6819.8
my show that I am honored in a way

6821.52 --> 6826.139
I mean

6822.9 --> 6829.5599999999995
could pretty much say

6826.139 --> 6832.04
did have you heard have you heard me

6829.56 --> 6834.84
I've been saying it for like five years

6832.04 --> 6836.28
that in 2000

6834.84 --> 6838.9800000000005
12.

6836.28 --> 6843.3
I saw your

6838.98 --> 6845.339999999999
YouTube video about Flat Earth in the

6843.3 --> 6847.9800000000005
dark world because I'm pretty sure you

6845.34 --> 6850.88
hadn't made a YouTube video yet

6847.98 --> 6850.879999999999
did you know that

6851.04 --> 6856.619
how weird is that like I literally

6853.739 --> 6859.259999999999
recognized your voice when I

6856.619 --> 6861.54
started to enter YouTube

6859.26 --> 6864.179
and I bumped into your videos after Mark

6861.54 --> 6867.84
Sergeant I literally recognized your

6864.179 --> 6871.5
voice like I saw that I saw this video

6867.84 --> 6871.5
in 2012.

6883.08 --> 6889.639
been spamming your head out what

6886.8 --> 6889.639
is the real deal

6891.3 --> 6896.28
okay well in that case Eric Dubai just

6894.06 --> 6897.719
for safety measures I'm gonna give you a

6896.28 --> 6902.0599999999995
wrench

6897.719 --> 6902.06
because the socks like to get in here

6903.599 --> 6911.06
and yeah play around so for this I am

6907.86 --> 6911.0599999999995
going to rent you up

6912.719 --> 6917.4
until you prove you aren't actually him

6914.699 --> 6920.098999999999
and then I'll take it away again but I

6917.4 --> 6922.739

6922.739 --> 6924.98
