171.2 --> 173.83999999999997

i almost considered just not doing the

177.36 --> 181.84
show today because

179.44 --> 184.84
it really disrupted my sleep cycle this

181.84 --> 184.84
time

185.92 --> 188.07999999999998
yeah

186.959 --> 190.959
but

188.08 --> 193.68
i'm gonna try doing it and

190.959 --> 196.48
i don't know maybe

193.68 --> 198.31900000000002
next few days i'm gonna like take a few

196.48 --> 200.72
days off

198.319 --> 203.28
until they stop doing that and i can get

200.72 --> 207.92
a proper rest in the morning

203.28 --> 207.92
because it's really yeah wearing on me

208.69 --> 212.799
[Music]

[Music]

244.64 --> 247.79899999999998
all right

249.77 --> 258.79900000000004
[Music]

254.879 --> 258.799
ah and i thought it was gonna stop

258.88 --> 262.8
because it had been like silent for like

260.88 --> 268.12
five minutes right before the show so i

262.8 --> 268.12
thought i'm finally gonna stop it but no

268.32 --> 270.639
uh

271.36 --> 273.52000000000004
well

277.52 --> 280.4
right

278.88 --> 282.8
anyway

280.4 --> 285.59999999999997
just want to report in that

282.8 --> 288.0
owen benjamin had a really fascinating

285.6 --> 288.0
stream

290.56 --> 296.4
uh yeah from yesterday

293.44 --> 298.24
where he got the guy

296.4 --> 300.4
audi machowski

298.24 --> 302.56
on his show

300.4 --> 304.0
and that's the guy that

302.56 --> 307.199
well i linked to

304.0 --> 310.96
what is it now a couple of weeks ago

307.199 --> 313.52000000000004
so showed it to adam because yeah he

310.96 --> 315.59999999999997
is like a historical researcher and he

313.52 --> 318.79999999999995
dug up some very interesting things

315.6 --> 318.8
about southern france

318.88 --> 324.24
and basically

321.919 --> 326.71999999999997
figuring out that maybe the bible didn't

324.24 --> 328.40000000000003
take place in palestine

326.72 --> 331.759
but it was actually in the south of

328.4 --> 334.32
france and he's put a lot of work into

331.759 --> 335.36
yeah figuring out how

334.32 --> 336.4
and

335.36 --> 339.84000000000003
yeah i'm

336.4 --> 343.84
what is now like 50 minutes into that

339.84 --> 345.84
show it's two hours and 46 minutes

343.84 --> 348.32
but yeah

345.84 --> 350.479
absolutely a must watch

348.32 --> 350.479
but

351.12 --> 355.759
yeah if you haven't seen that here is

353.039 --> 358.4
the link definitely watch that if you're

355.759 --> 358.40000000000003
interested in

359.68 --> 362.96
in

360.4 --> 366.919
that subject

362.96 --> 366.919
hey slow mo moon buggy

387.28 --> 393.15999999999997
uh you watched it twice already slow mo

389.6 --> 393.16
moon okay

394.8 --> 398.88
yeah i only bumped into it like last

396.96 --> 401.52
night but i really had to go to bed i

398.88 --> 402.71999999999997
wasn't gonna keep myself awake to like

401.52 --> 404.639
four or

402.72 --> 406.47900000000004
five o'clock

404.639 --> 408.96000000000004
i already went to bed way too late

406.479 --> 411.52
really and that that's why my sleep so

408.96 --> 416.08
disruptive because they kind of start

411.52 --> 416.08
this [ __ ] around what is it nine or ten

421.52 --> 425.599
maybe if i force myself to go to bed

423.44 --> 429.0
really early today

425.599 --> 429.0
that would help

457.199 --> 460.199
uh

474.8 --> 478.40000000000003
right anyway

477.68 --> 480.24
yeah

478.4 --> 482.0
nathan didn't have a show yesterday

480.24 --> 484.40000000000003
unfortunately

482.0 --> 486.639
kind of boring

484.4 --> 486.63899999999995
but

486.72 --> 495.36
he was certainly like replaying his uh

491.199 --> 495.36
his show he did on sunday

495.599 --> 499.599
flat earth math

498.319 --> 501.91900000000004
and yes

499.599 --> 505.319
it's it's brutal

501.919 --> 505.31899999999996
but deserving

506.639 --> 511.68
waiting on the rain to pass over here oh

508.879 --> 514.08
is it raining over there huh

511.68 --> 516.159
well there was even a bit of hail here

514.08 --> 518.88
yesterday when i went out for groceries

516.159 --> 521.279
but just occasionally

518.88 --> 523.2
it's not like a long lasting amount of

521.279 --> 528.12
rain and hail

523.2 --> 528.12
but yeah i guess we're lucky over here

540.72 --> 545.9590000000001
yeah yeah howdy machowski seems very

542.959 --> 545.959
interesting

550.24 --> 555.4
i'd love to kind of dig into more of his

553.76 --> 557.04
work it's just that

555.4 --> 559.279
[Music]

557.04 --> 562.88
i can't do it right now

559.279 --> 566.32
i'm too disrupted i can't focus

562.88 --> 568.88
on on that sort of thing

566.32 --> 568.88
too much

573.31 --> 578.3199999999999
[Music]

575.04 --> 578.3199999999999
a flatter sage

588.72 --> 595.36
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

591.839 --> 595.36
are you doing a live show today

595.839 --> 599.5600000000001
hey tara 306.

619.12 --> 622.8
it

620.64 --> 625.12
could be nathan is still watching ads or

622.8 --> 625.12
something

631.04 --> 635.24
let me just type it out

634.45 --> 638.4290000000001
[Applause]

635.24 --> 638.429
[Music]

674.8 --> 678.76
ah life show awesome

699.2 --> 703.839
i reckon they're filling the holes from

701.519 --> 707.6
yesterday's really

703.839 --> 707.6
well i think they're just like

710.32 --> 714.9590000000001
like cutting

712.24 --> 716.72
drill cutting tiles off

714.959 --> 720.079
like a bathroom wall or something i

716.72 --> 720.0790000000001
think they're mostly doing that

720.639 --> 724.24
like

721.519 --> 724.24
there's like a

725.6 --> 729.16
what do you call it

734.8 --> 740.079
like the the trash from

738.32 --> 743.839
redecorating

740.079 --> 745.4399999999999
is like outside in one of those big

743.839 --> 747.6800000000001
scoop like things what i don't know what

745.44 --> 751.12
you call them english but

747.68 --> 753.3599999999999
yeah it looked like bathroom stuff so

751.12 --> 755.2
that's probably what they're doing right

753.36 --> 756.639
it is so much of it because they're just

755.2 --> 760.24
like

756.639 --> 763.6800000000001
trying to cut all these tiles

760.24 --> 765.6800000000001
off the wall there they're like really

763.68 --> 767.8389999999999
cut going from scratch

765.68 --> 771.68
with the whole thing i think

767.839 --> 771.6800000000001
but yeah that means a lot of noise

773.29 --> 776.4699999999999
[Music]

778.8 --> 783.639
yeah come on nathan stop it

787.44 --> 790.44
ugh

803.279 --> 806.279
uh

819.04 --> 822.04
uh

838.639 --> 841.639
ah

843.12 --> 849.279
no no i don't follow any of that nathan

846.88 --> 851.519
any of it anymore really the only thing

849.279 --> 851.519
that i

852.88 --> 858.32
still get to even hear about is like

854.72 --> 858.32
through infowars or something

858.639 --> 864.6
i don't follow any of that

860.72 --> 864.6
be right back in two minutes

886.88 --> 889.88
uh

955.759 --> 958.0
yo

961.199 --> 966.279
spam again

963.279 --> 966.279
huh

979.36 --> 983.519
what service day you've never seen

981.12 --> 986.92
anything like this it does this in chats

983.519 --> 986.92
all the time

1038.4 --> 1043.679
oh yeah by the way notice that sky free

1041.12 --> 1046.3999999999999
is now doing streams

1043.679 --> 1046.4
live streams

1046.72 --> 1053.72
like even on camera

1049.76 --> 1053.72
notice that yesterday

1077.039 --> 1080.799
right oh yeah

1078.72 --> 1082.72
i just forgot

1080.799 --> 1086.0
i'm probably not going to do a live

1082.72 --> 1089.2
stream this thursday

1086.0 --> 1091.84
because there's going to be somebody

1089.2 --> 1093.919
like reinstalling the internet and

1091.84 --> 1096.3999999999999
that's like right around when my show

1093.919 --> 1096.4
starts

1096.72 --> 1099.1200000000001
so

1097.52 --> 1100.8799999999999
yeah

1099.12 --> 1102.32
like i wouldn't even be able to do the

1100.88 --> 1104.3200000000002
stream because it's probably going to be

1102.32 --> 1106.72
disconnected

1104.32 --> 1109.4399999999998
and maybe he'll be really quick or

1106.72 --> 1111.6000000000001
something

1109.44 --> 1112.64
and then i can still do like part of the

1111.6 --> 1114.7199999999998
show but

1112.64 --> 1118.2
it's most likely that it's just not

1114.72 --> 1118.2
gonna work out

1125.28 --> 1132.559
although i think i could still probably

1128.559 --> 1132.559
join the flat earth debates after that

1135.52 --> 1139.039
if nothing goes wrong with the

1137.28 --> 1140.72
installation and all that

1139.039 --> 1144.52
so yeah

1140.72 --> 1144.52
hey pj crew shack

1150.72 --> 1155.84
yeah sky freeze boat stuff is very cool

1153.919 --> 1158.48
yeah they're always like right on top

1155.84 --> 1161.48
like miraging effects and all that very

1158.48 --> 1161.48
interesting

1176.4 --> 1181.65
ah

1178.49 --> 1181.65
[Music]

1183.99 --> 1187.89
[Music]

1235.6 --> 1240.24
was that guy nathan had a debate with

1237.76 --> 1243.12
that's charles flat earth math it's like

1240.24 --> 1243.1200000000001
from way back

1243.52 --> 1249.72
it was evolved a lot in the early days

1246.0 --> 1249.72
of the flat earth debate

1251.2 --> 1255.76
but he had disappeared for a while off

1253.28 --> 1258.76
the scene and this was basically his

1255.76 --> 1258.76
return

1262.4 --> 1268.48
but yeah he was even like pretty much a

1265.12 --> 1273.2399999999998
liar like this even back then so it's

1268.48 --> 1273.24
just yeah it hasn't changed much

1282.32 --> 1287.52
he's a guy that's always nice and smiley

1285.039 --> 1288.64
always never gets angry always nice and

1287.52 --> 1291.36
smiley

1288.64 --> 1294.3200000000002
but he just it does just straightforward

1291.36 --> 1294.32
light to your face

1298.0 --> 1301.96
kind of a creep in a way

1318.88 --> 1323.2

1321.36 --> 1326.0
don't remember really

1323.2 --> 1329.679
