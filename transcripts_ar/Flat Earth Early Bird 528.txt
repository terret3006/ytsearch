41.9 --> 43.96
you

53.64 --> 57.88
good

55.45 --> 60.67
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

57.88 --> 62.260000000000005
number 528 I'm your host

60.67 --> 64.18
Arwen and before we start the show

would be much appreciated

86.49 --> 102.33
so the weather today is beautiful look

92.259 --> 102.33
at that and people walking outside

106.229 --> 116.58
it's a really nice sunny Monday just a

112.049 --> 119.549
few clouds but very little such a nice

116.58 --> 121.5
blue sky so yeah there's weather

119.549 --> 124.67
yesterday really cleared up for the

121.5 --> 130.02
skies like that

124.67 --> 134.28
so yes sir if you're being a bit late to

130.02 --> 138.95000000000002
just somehow you know when I try to

134.28 --> 138.95
start up the shows things get in between

140.03 --> 146.19
it happens suburbs so I got cream tea

143.97 --> 153.9
with me that's it

146.19 --> 155.91
let's see you isn't chat right so Steve

153.9 --> 165.239
was first Amanda young

155.91 --> 168.89
Oh Braco dank Jim Jones he haba good

165.239 --> 168.89000000000001
servant dinosaur Falcon

171.67 --> 176.85999999999999
Tom Parker Robin Stanley

179.33 --> 193.49
sadly that Cosentino good see you yeah

182.69 --> 195.59
good to see you all so I think I went to

193.49 --> 199.49
bed pretty early yesterday but it's bit

195.59 --> 204.14000000000001
of a blur I tapped into the an exotic

199.49 --> 206.44
bottle from Wales parents house again so

204.14 --> 211.05999999999997
I don't really remember what I was doing

206.44 --> 211.06
yesterday evening what was I doing

217.37 --> 223.12900000000002
let me let me see if I can figure it out

233.44 --> 242.8
no no yeah there was some Owen Benjamin

240.79 --> 244.75
I think yeah that was it

242.8 --> 246.91000000000003
I watched Owen Benjamin I think it was

244.75 --> 250.18
the last thing tonight oh yeah

246.91 --> 255.79
also I figured something out I got a tip

250.18 --> 259.209
of it yesterday in Chad but yeah [ __ ]

255.79 --> 262.21
shoot apparently like all all of

259.209 --> 264.19
Benjamin's videos are just there so I

262.21 --> 266.91999999999996
could literally watch any of them I

264.19 --> 268.75
didn't even know that it just goes to

266.92 --> 270.55
show like he says it all the time you

268.75 --> 273.64
know watch me on [ __ ] you this and that

270.55 --> 275.17
and I just don't pick up on it I guess

273.64 --> 278.71
it's because of all the the platform

275.17 --> 284.77000000000004
names and things I can't almost not

278.71 --> 287.89
listen to that part anymore I did but

284.77 --> 290.77
yeah I should have this anyway I yeah I

287.89 --> 295.41999999999996
can watch back on Benjamin stuff and

290.77 --> 301.06
yeah the chair the chair it's all the

295.42 --> 304.12
talk the chair so yeah that was pretty

301.06 --> 309.61
funny although I think I really think

304.12 --> 311.56
that it kind of was a trick like on

309.61 --> 314.59000000000003
Benjamin he talked about it yesterday

311.56 --> 317.56
and he kind of mentioned four at one

314.59 --> 322.17999999999995
point like yeah and maybe it was just a

317.56 --> 323.98
me pulling the chair with her shoe like

322.18 --> 325.99
a joke and then didn't mention it again

323.98 --> 328.6
so I think that might have been a trick

325.99 --> 332.77
but it was interesting anyway it was

328.6 --> 335.91900000000004
funny and it does catch the people's

332.77 --> 339.58
imagination a lot and then there's this

335.919 --> 342.4
Oracle kinetic psyonix side effects that

339.58 --> 345.03999999999996
you could also consider in some way if

342.4 --> 350.77
it was in the trick and yeah I've my own

345.04 --> 352.21000000000004
personal situation with that that I

350.77 --> 355.08
explained yesterday with that weird

352.21 --> 355.08
little closet over there

365.37 --> 368.15
I went

374.34 --> 380.57
the running Nika didn't know what's what

376.76 --> 380.57
what are you talking about

383.82 --> 386.82
Mining

390.77 --> 401.78
right a good servant was on the josé's

393.53 --> 405.60999999999996
again I I didn't see it I don't know I

401.78 --> 405.60999999999996
was kind of retracted yesterday

406.09 --> 409.279
[Music]

412.52 --> 426.89
yeah and the whole situation with Bronte

420.22 --> 428.66
Dhoni oh it's gonna get a bit tense and

426.89 --> 434.22999999999996
so many people are getting dragged into

428.66 --> 434.23
that I sent you 20 tonne

439.129 --> 442.689
what are you talking about hang

447.0 --> 454.65
should I be checking my paypal I kind of

449.58 --> 457.08
hope I should because yeah today I

454.65 --> 458.96
figured out again was also part of the

457.08 --> 464.93
reason why it was a little bit late oh

458.96 --> 468.69
yeah you did you did actually send me 20

464.93 --> 471.87
thank you Thank You Derrick that is most

468.69 --> 473.94
welcome thank you so much because I need

471.87 --> 476.7
it because yeah it turned out again that

473.94 --> 479.54
it was already broke it's the freaking

476.7 --> 484.2
fourth but because of a combination of

479.54 --> 487.47
things that I've done I think mostly the

484.2 --> 489.59999999999997
tobacco and I paid off like a bill and I

487.47 --> 494.82000000000005
kind of underestimate how much that

489.6 --> 496.95000000000005
actually cuts into my budget so I need

494.82 --> 499.14
to be fooling around with finances again

496.95 --> 501.27
to get around and yeah any PayPal

499.14 --> 502.22999999999996
donation would be extremely welcome so

501.27 --> 507.96
thank you so much

502.23 --> 511.16900000000004
bank for the 20 euros that is definitely

507.96 --> 514.5
gonna help and I promise I will spend it

511.169 --> 517.13
on myself and they'll actually follow up

514.5 --> 517.13
on that promise

533.81 --> 541.7199999999999
okay I'm getting some odd questions from

536.09 --> 541.72
people I don't know necessarily DMK 2020

542.17 --> 550.3399999999999
what is this about a fruit salad I'm

547.28 --> 557.15
yeah it's not something I really want I

550.34 --> 560.21
prefer fresh fruits at times it's that

557.15 --> 563.51
trend I can hear no no Kiwi gammer

560.21 --> 567.59
unfortunately it's not mine but there is

563.51 --> 570.11
like one of the neighbors in the outer

567.59 --> 574.6700000000001
corner of this flat apartment like this

570.11 --> 579.0500000000001
flat is basically this right so over

574.67 --> 584.9499999999999
there this is exactly in the corner so

579.05 --> 584.9499999999999
this building part over there this thing

585.07 --> 592.13
it's about as long in that direction

589.69 --> 595.84
that direction and over there in that

592.13 --> 598.9399999999999
bottom corner there is somebody that has

595.84 --> 603.08
chickens and those are the ones that are

598.94 --> 605.48
usually making the noise and then

603.08 --> 608.0600000000001
there's one across the street as well

605.48 --> 613.8100000000001
sometimes chickens from there walk

608.06 --> 616.8599999999999
around as well but it's not mine

613.81 --> 616.8599999999999
[Music]

617.72 --> 625.279
ah thank ya Jose's chat is is ballistic

622.73 --> 630.6700000000001
it's insane it's what Flat Earth debates

625.279 --> 634.3389999999999
Chet used to be before they just yeah

630.67 --> 637.3389999999999
before Nathan kind of window yeah so

634.339 --> 639.5290000000001
harsh on the ballers that's just those

637.339 --> 641.149
trolls just can't handle themselves in

639.529 --> 643.459
the Flat Earth debates anymore but they

641.149 --> 646.699
they still feel kind of like they're

643.459 --> 648.7399999999999
winning inside in over at Jose so yeah

646.699 --> 651.2589999999999
they get pretty damn disgusting I'm used

648.74 --> 654.259
to that now like every time I get there

651.259 --> 658.189
I just mentioned my name once I'll get

654.259 --> 661.759
like this spam of my name just twenty

658.189 --> 663.74
times people trying to did trying to

661.759 --> 666.0500000000001
squirt all over me and all that and just

663.74 --> 672.67
getting disgusting and trying to lure me

666.05 --> 672.67
out and straw man me it's very typical I

673.149 --> 680.68
only go there when I feel like it hello

678.019 --> 680.68
Amanda you

683.52 --> 686.549
[Music]

687.88 --> 696.7
at mo our sphere presuppositions do you

694.25 --> 701.269
think the globe can have an atmosphere

696.7 --> 704.0600000000001
well it depends on how you're gonna

701.269 --> 705.7090000000001
wheel that model conceptualization now

704.06 --> 711.2299999999999
the problem is that the earth isn't a

705.709 --> 713.4799999999999
globe and we can definitely have an

711.23 --> 717.649
atmosphere within the container of the

713.48 --> 720.44
realm but yeah what would it be on a

717.649 --> 722.839
globe yeah that's that's that all

720.44 --> 726.649
depends on what what yeah how you're

722.839 --> 727.97
gonna conduct the setup presupposition

726.649 --> 730.64
Li because you're gonna have to be

727.97 --> 733.25
presupposition e you're gonna have to be

730.64 --> 735.74
presuppositional if you're gonna lay a

733.25 --> 739.39
groundwork literally for the earth being

735.74 --> 742.19
a globe and the rest surrounding it so

739.39 --> 745.43
and if you're if you're okay with doing

742.19 --> 748.5790000000001
that then everything technically becomes

745.43 --> 753.7299999999999
flexible when yeah you're overlooking

748.579 --> 756.17
something that fundamental you know I

753.73 --> 761.44
don't know how high the container is

756.17 --> 761.4399999999999
genuine chloro fuel

762.45 --> 765.71
I have no idea

773.009 --> 780.24
it could be really high then there could

777.79 --> 783.43
be like multiple effective layers

780.24 --> 787.2090000000001
happening like who knows maybe there are

783.43 --> 793.9799999999999
like multiple barriers maybe where we

787.209 --> 796.899
can reach is is like a layer before

793.98 --> 804.4490000000001
where the actual container with the gas

796.899 --> 804.449
and all that ends I don't know

805.49 --> 810.08
it's been suggested before that there's

807.86 --> 813.02
like this invisible energy shield that

810.08 --> 817.19
prevents things from passing beyond it

813.02 --> 821.66
but yeah when this energy shield this

817.19 --> 824.33
area is it it only seems to affect the

821.66 --> 827.51
object being hit like a rocket or

824.33 --> 829.73
whatever it doesn't affect the actual

827.51 --> 832.55
visuals it's not like you're bumping

829.73 --> 834.5
into a flexible mirror that then

832.55 --> 837.02
suddenly ripples the visuals you know

834.5 --> 839.959
which if it was a literal physical

837.02 --> 843.62
barrier barrier mirror like barrier

839.959 --> 847.5799999999999
supposedly then you would have all these

843.62 --> 849.11
visual effects you don't so if there

847.58 --> 852.8000000000001
really is a barrier there then it is

849.11 --> 857.27
probably just a barrier within the

852.8 --> 859.1899999999999
container which would make it yeah the

857.27 --> 861.05
whole situation quite mysterious like

859.19 --> 868.4590000000001
why is there like an energy barrier

861.05 --> 871.18
there yeah what can you say about that

868.459 --> 871.18
you know

873.53 --> 877.65
Landen okay what will container

875.76 --> 879.5699999999999
atmosphere right pressure difference

877.65 --> 881.91
well it's because of relative density

879.57 --> 883.7700000000001
there is a pressure difference because

881.91 --> 886.26
of relative density relative density is

883.77 --> 888.84
a given it's a scientific provable fact

886.26 --> 892.46
provable and repeatable very easy to do

888.84 --> 896.1
and it counts for the entire realm and

892.46 --> 898.47
yeah you can extrapolate from that that

896.1 --> 901.59
there is an alignment going up denser

898.47 --> 904.1700000000001
seems to be drawn down less than seems

901.59 --> 908.52
to be drawn up and you can consider that

904.17 --> 910.68
as little G as as supposed foundation of

908.52 --> 913.77
the graph yeah the gravity aberration

910.68 --> 916.7099999999999
conceptualization right but it is just

913.77 --> 918.5699999999999
an effect so what causes the pressure

916.71 --> 925.47
differences in at the heights is

918.57 --> 928.0400000000001
relative density that's the cause so it

925.47 --> 928.0400000000001
is there

930.68 --> 936.43
and this is this is provable you can do

933.8 --> 940.0699999999999
it in a small container as well you can

936.43 --> 943.8499999999999
empty it out then fill in different

940.07 --> 946.7
types of gases right today of color it's

943.85 --> 950.6
ideal if some of them have colored then

946.7 --> 952.5200000000001
yeah first you let it mix in you just

950.6 --> 955.76
pump it in there you let it get sucked

952.52 --> 957.62
in there and then you let it settle and

955.76 --> 960.14
first it's all mixed up of course but

957.62 --> 962.93
then it settles because relative density

960.14 --> 965.54
sets in eventually and there will be

962.93 --> 969.29
some kind of gradient where the gas will

965.54 --> 972.1999999999999
be through like the lighter less dense

969.29 --> 974.06
gas will be somewhat mixed in partially

972.2 --> 976.76
with the denser gas you might see that

974.06 --> 979.7299999999999
if one of the gas has a color less dense

976.76 --> 982.76
the denser gas will then yeah so there

979.73 --> 985.22
will effectively manifest a gradient if

982.76 --> 988.37
it is perfectly perfectly perfectly

985.22 --> 991.61
still there's no temperature influence

988.37 --> 994.4590000000001
from the outside no motion whatsoever

991.61 --> 1003.37
like perfectly still then a gradient

994.459 --> 1007.7199999999999
will form part salad really Wow

1003.37 --> 1009.339
okay extra sock yeah by the way thank

1007.72 --> 1013.26
you Amanda young for the $2 approach a

1009.339 --> 1016.5
donation I will check my paypal awesome

1013.26 --> 1016.5
love this

1020.91 --> 1026.1599999999999
Wow

1022.39 --> 1028.6
thank you so much 20 euros from you -

1026.16 --> 1030.25
thank you so much Amanda young that's

I feel truly blessed such lovely loyal

1039.85 --> 1046.56
viewers that helped me keep afloat and

1044.65 --> 1050.26
keeping the show going because of that

1046.56 --> 1061.6
thank you so much Amanda young for your

1050.26 --> 1065.77
unwavering support no extra sock dude it

1061.6 --> 1068.62
I know you you got here to get squirted

1065.77 --> 1069.22
right it's it's one of the masochist

1068.62 --> 1075.25
sucks

1069.22 --> 1077.2
well no it's you're not interesting and

1075.25 --> 1080.71
offensive enough to be banned

1077.2 --> 1086.8600000000001
you're just an extra sock you are called

1080.71 --> 1090.82
an extra sock so now I'm just gonna like

1086.86 --> 1093.09
roughly ignore you I don't need to ban

1090.82 --> 1093.09
you

1098.45 --> 1102.009
[Music]

1102.44 --> 1109.02
alright London but the air consists of

1106.11 --> 1112.59
the same things go in a mountain and

1109.02 --> 1115.58
breathe that air this is different gases

1112.59 --> 1118.11
it's the same gas is just different

1115.58 --> 1121.1399999999999
concentration oh that's just what I

1118.11 --> 1123.7199999999998
described Lennon remember you put

1121.14 --> 1126.3600000000001
different types of gases separately into

1123.72 --> 1130.26
a vacuum tank let it fill up with that

1126.36 --> 1133.82
and then effectively a gradient will

1130.26 --> 1139.32
form if it gets enough time and

1133.82 --> 1143.34
tranquility to settle properly see so

1139.32 --> 1145.9189999999999
yes it's the same gases up in a high

1143.34 --> 1148.53
mountain as at sea level except at sea

1145.919 --> 1150.929
level yeah there's gonna be much more of

1148.53 --> 1153.809
the heavy gases there's much more likely

1150.929 --> 1157.77
to be more co2 there's more likely to be

1153.809 --> 1159.87
more water vapor much more likely than

1157.77 --> 1163.29
up at a mountain where there is more

1159.87 --> 1164.6689999999999
likely to be more hydrogen present very

1163.29 --> 1167.28
little still because it should

1164.669 --> 1171.48
eventually end up much higher and some

1167.28 --> 1173.58
helium like the percentages within the

1171.48 --> 1177.809
air should be higher of that because it

1173.58 --> 1180.8999999999999
is higher up it is closer to where the

1177.809 --> 1183.0
less dense will travel to to their

1180.9 --> 1191.91
equilibrium point within the spectrum of

1183.0 --> 1195.69
all things on the on the alignment so

1191.91 --> 1198.15
yeah of course I don't see I don't see a

1195.69 --> 1200.809
problem in this it's like why is it a

1198.15 --> 1203.3700000000001
problem that it's just the case that

1200.809 --> 1206.49
there's less pressure up as there is

1203.37 --> 1211.1299999999999
down no and if you want to be but the

1206.49 --> 1214.77
causes and all that well yeah you know a

1211.13 --> 1218.25
gas pressure gradient requires gas

1214.77 --> 1223.179
pressure a gas gas pressure requires a

1218.25 --> 1226.599
container so it's that simple really

1223.179 --> 1229.21
if you want to bring all that up to try

1226.599 --> 1230.95
and see if you can worm some kind of

1229.21 --> 1234.429
argument for the ball out of it it

1230.95 --> 1237.909
that's completely hopeless but just to

1234.429 --> 1240.45
figure out like why are the things in

1237.909 --> 1243.8790000000001
this realm the way they are yeah sure

1240.45 --> 1248.289
it's worth investigating I that's why I

1243.879 --> 1250.349
have done it so I try to figure it all

1248.289 --> 1250.349
out

1262.13 --> 1269.5390000000002
okay okay Landon that's fine that's okay

1267.559 --> 1272.3899999999999
you've come to the right place

1269.539 --> 1280.059
I can answer and I can clear up a lot of

1272.39 --> 1285.0200000000002
things like to me it makes no sense that

1280.059 --> 1287.1789999999999
you can that it doesn't make any sense

1285.02 --> 1289.91
to you that someone could believe in

1287.179 --> 1292.0900000000001
Flat Earth as you say you know that

1289.91 --> 1295.01
doesn't make any sense to me because

1292.09 --> 1299.33
when you talk about belief well what do

1295.01 --> 1302.33
we believe in you know do do you know or

1299.33 --> 1306.1999999999998
is it just the Flat Earth like what

1302.33 --> 1309.08
makes us believe in the Flat Earth or

1306.2 --> 1311.74
maybe it's just for example the

1309.08 --> 1315.4089999999999
housekeeping questions for the globe and

1311.74 --> 1317.96
how all these critical foundational

1315.409 --> 1321.47
pieces of evidence are completely and

1317.96 --> 1324.559
entirely missing like where is the

1321.47 --> 1329.72
curvature there is no curvature you can

1324.559 --> 1337.07
see too far and that is not possible on

1329.72 --> 1339.2
a yeah on a geometrical globe and then

1337.07 --> 1341.12
there's the idea of refraction and all

1339.2 --> 1344.51
but light maybe bending because of

1341.12 --> 1346.309
optics well guess what that that can

1344.51 --> 1349.76
work right but there's one thing it

1346.309 --> 1353.059
can't work on and that's the horizon the

1349.76 --> 1355.39
horizon itself cannot be refracted it is

1353.059 --> 1358.309
not an object

1355.39 --> 1362.45
the apparition the visual apparition of

1358.309 --> 1366.799
the horizon is not an object that can be

1362.45 --> 1373.3400000000001
subjected to a refraction in a way it is

1366.799 --> 1375.26
a a refraction sort of type effect it is

1373.34 --> 1377.78
diffraction it is mostly a diffraction

1375.26 --> 1379.73
inducing because perspective limited

1377.78 --> 1381.83
feel the angle and the diffraction

1379.73 --> 1382.64
effect of looking over flat surfaces

1381.83 --> 1386.03
eventually

1382.64 --> 1389.5700000000002
yeah the optical slant effect welker and

1386.03 --> 1391.61
that is how we see the beginning yet the

1389.57 --> 1394.01
horizon you could even see beyond that

1391.61 --> 1396.62
right but it is

1394.01 --> 1398.87
effectively very straight and in the Far

1396.62 --> 1402.6399999999999
length that we can see at a very minimum

1398.87 --> 1406.34
of serve right very low that just is

1402.64 --> 1410.69
geometrically impossible to see that far

1406.34 --> 1414.3799999999999
there is no optics that can make you see

1410.69 --> 1417.23
that far on the globe there is no

1414.38 --> 1419.69
possibility for this it's impossible

1417.23 --> 1422.47
physically through optics there's no

1419.69 --> 1427.13
manner of science-fiction machination

1422.47 --> 1431.1200000000001
can make you see that far at such low

1427.13 --> 1436.5500000000002
observer height on the globe there is no

1431.12 --> 1439.37
physical possibility for that so that's

1436.55 --> 1442.97
just a start you know then we can look

1439.37 --> 1445.37
at just the entire models setup of what

1442.97 --> 1449.54
is supposedly out there outside of the

1445.37 --> 1451.61
globe the presupposed glove now yeah

1449.54 --> 1455.54
that really doesn't work out all that

1451.61 --> 1459.6499999999999
well either because in the heliocentric

1455.54 --> 1462.6499999999999
model what is above the atmosphere is

1459.65 --> 1464.99
effectively a vacuum it's suggested to

1462.65 --> 1468.25
go lower lower lower lower and just

1464.99 --> 1475.94
keeps on going lower lower lower

1468.25 --> 1480.04
but yeah the the amount just the the the

1475.94 --> 1483.17
the way the the pressure is divided is

1480.04 --> 1485.21
illogical because they're making it into

1483.17 --> 1487.19
an asymptote they're making it into a

1485.21 --> 1490.3700000000001
hockey stick where there is relatively

1487.19 --> 1492.5
heavy pressure lobe and then it just

1490.37 --> 1494.12
keeps on infinitely getting steeper well

1492.5 --> 1497.09
that's not technically possible that's

1494.12 --> 1499.61
not how a gradient forms in the real

1497.09 --> 1502.07
world and any any where it's not

1499.61 --> 1505.9399999999998
possible because if the pressure is too

1502.07 --> 1508.7
low in the same container then it will

1505.94 --> 1511.8200000000002
pull it will offset the rest so if there

1508.7 --> 1514.88
is an almost infinite depth of a

1511.82 --> 1517.54
container the outer space versus what is

1514.88 --> 1521.15
gas pressure here on the earth that

1517.54 --> 1523.01
gradient could never settle the way it

1521.15 --> 1525.73
does on this earth

1523.01 --> 1530.0
that's not a gradient that is logical

1525.73 --> 1534.32
that is based in logic the gas pressure

1530.0 --> 1536.9
gradient so yeah this argument that I

1534.32 --> 1538.79
just detailed is also known as she can't

1536.9 --> 1541.25
have gas pressure without a container

1538.79 --> 1544.549
because it is suggested that the earth

1541.25 --> 1547.37
has gas pressure while sitting in an

1544.549 --> 1550.34
outer space that is effectively a vacuum

1547.37 --> 1552.6499999999999
so how is this gas pressure then if that

1550.34 --> 1555.62
is the model how is this gas pressure

1552.65 --> 1560.66
sticking to this ball with effectively

1555.62 --> 1564.29
without a container and that is

1560.66 --> 1567.3200000000002
impossible that's a contradiction to

1564.29 --> 1569.4189999999999
nature of law the entropy law gas

1567.32 --> 1572.33
pressure expands in all directions to

1569.419 --> 1576.47
fill the container if it can if that

1572.33 --> 1579.26
space is available to it and it can only

1576.47 --> 1582.29
really manifest gas pressure in us in

1579.26 --> 1585.59
some kind of stable way when the entire

1582.29 --> 1588.049
container has been filled so that the

1585.59 --> 1590.48
gas can push against the container walls

1588.049 --> 1592.22
and then form an equilibrium in gas

1590.48 --> 1594.169
pressure with everything else in the

1592.22 --> 1597.59
container and then after that relative

1594.169 --> 1600.5
density may set in and then a gradient

1597.59 --> 1604.1
could form but first the walls of the

1600.5 --> 1606.559
container have to be met by the gas

1604.1 --> 1613.58
going in all directions in order for gas

1606.559 --> 1615.32
pressure to form see and gravity yeah

1613.58 --> 1617.6299999999999
again gravity I talked about this

1615.32 --> 1623.78
earlier on the show the gravity gravity

1617.63 --> 1629.24
is an effect it is basically originated

1623.78 --> 1633.11
on little G which is like an explanation

1629.24 --> 1635.39
for the effect of the alignment that is

1633.11 --> 1638.12
apparent within the relative density

1635.39 --> 1642.22
Theory the scientifically provable

1638.12 --> 1647.11
relative density theory so that

1642.22 --> 1649.3700000000001
alignment is not a force it's an effect

1647.11 --> 1652.3899999999999
because relative density disk

1649.37 --> 1655.79
equilibrium is what causes the force of

1652.39 --> 1656.7800000000002
which that effect is in effect it's a

1655.79 --> 1660.68
side effect it

1656.78 --> 1664.04
it comes forth from relative density so

1660.68 --> 1667.6100000000001
the effect of gravity is not a container

1664.04 --> 1669.86
it cannot contain now if you would think

1667.61 --> 1672.1999999999998
of gravity as a force you know because

1669.86 --> 1673.76
that's allowed these days you know you

1672.2 --> 1675.92
don't really have to stick to the really

1673.76 --> 1677.39
is level supposedly concerning these

1675.92 --> 1680.8100000000002
things according to a lot of ballers

1677.39 --> 1682.8500000000001
well even if you would think gravity is

1680.81 --> 1685.4299999999998
a force somehow that there's this feels

1682.85 --> 1688.76
this in graspable in detectable feel

1685.43 --> 1693.5
that pushes right guess what a little

1688.76 --> 1695.69
push is not a container if you push it's

1693.5 --> 1700.31
not a container that only works on

1695.69 --> 1702.14
solids push only could be some kind of

1700.31 --> 1705.8899999999999
container for solids in a way

1702.14 --> 1710.51
gas gas pressure expanding in all

1705.89 --> 1712.7
directions yeah what's it gonna do that

1710.51 --> 1714.94
that gravity that's supposed to force

1712.7 --> 1718.88
this equilibrium field it's gonna push

1714.94 --> 1721.94
very slowly slightly the other direction

1718.88 --> 1725.72
or guess what gas pressure expansion

1721.94 --> 1728.53
especially in a vacuum is incredibly

1725.72 --> 1732.8600000000001
powerful and that's demonstrated is

1728.53 --> 1735.7
instantaneous and it's violent gas

1732.86 --> 1740.6899999999998
rushing into a perfect vacuum is

1735.7 --> 1743.47
extremely quick and violent boom boom so

1740.69 --> 1747.68
how is it this stable push of

1743.47 --> 1751.3700000000001
presupposed force gravity how is that

1747.68 --> 1755.45
gonna be counteracting moving it's not

1751.37 --> 1760.1799999999998
and that's yeah even in the science

1755.45 --> 1763.16
consensus world physics sort of right

1760.18 --> 1766.51
gravity is considered a weak force when

1763.16 --> 1770.63
you think of it as a force entropy is

1766.51 --> 1774.71
among these strongest forces known it is

1770.63 --> 1776.72
extremely so yeah how is this gravity in

1774.71 --> 1779.98
any way even if you want to think of it

1776.72 --> 1782.6000000000001
as a force gonna contain gas pressure

1779.98 --> 1784.67
moving in all directions to try to fill

1782.6 --> 1788.27
the container of the universe with such

1784.67 --> 1789.539
violent force provable measurable force

1788.27 --> 1792.929
it's the

1789.539 --> 1796.4089999999999
right it needs to expand gasps it does

1792.929 --> 1798.21
it instantly so how its presupposed

1796.409 --> 1801.659
forced gravity going to be a container

1798.21 --> 1804.6290000000001
it's not it's absolutely impossible from

1801.659 --> 1807.239
every angle from what gravity is as an

1804.629 --> 1810.6
angle from how it could function as a

1807.239 --> 1813.659
force versus entropy it doesn't function

1810.6 --> 1817.1999999999998
it just doesn't it's not an argument so

1813.659 --> 1820.2
even think hinting at gravity having

1817.2 --> 1823.529
some container powers supposedly by say

1820.2 --> 1825.749
only graded the grade no it doesn't it's

1823.529 --> 1827.279
a preliminary to a completely broken

1825.749 --> 1830.7
argument and polished just don't get

1827.279 --> 1834.33
this they just don't get it that it is

1830.7 --> 1844.499
absolutely impossible from every

1834.33 --> 1847.02
conceivable angle hmm my mouth is not

1844.499 --> 1850.13
dry but it was kind of thirsty

1847.02 --> 1850.1299999999999
[Music]

1857.879 --> 1861.7489999999998
yeah but now you're talking about

1859.59 --> 1864.629
liquids Landon and the liquid and the

1861.749 --> 1869.039
gas is not the same liquids don't expand

1864.629 --> 1871.59
in all directions that's not true

1869.039 --> 1874.44
they only do that in extremely low

1871.59 --> 1879.509
pressure conditions then it evaporates

1874.44 --> 1881.929
as well just becomes gas to fill the

1879.509 --> 1881.929
void

1882.58 --> 1885.6499999999999
[Music]

1900.8 --> 1907.76
oh really could you demonstrate that

1904.22 --> 1916.1000000000001
Landon please do that with gasses love

1907.76 --> 1918.76
to see that you know this whole thing

1916.1 --> 1922.9699999999998
about a flat earth like the Flat Earth

1918.76 --> 1925.46
how is the Flat Earth even involved in

1922.97 --> 1929.06
what you're describing concern or the

1925.46 --> 1932.57
behavior of liquids and gases like what

1929.06 --> 1938.27
does Flat Earth have to do with any of

1932.57 --> 1940.9399999999998
that how does your version of the model

1938.27 --> 1943.31
or whatever a flat earth even involved

1940.94 --> 1945.68
in some way with that making it

1943.31 --> 1948.05
impossible why don't you try to describe

1945.68 --> 1950.51
how it is actually supposedly is

1948.05 --> 1953.48
impossible instead of just saying good

1950.51 --> 1956.96
now it's just ridiculous really so how

1953.48 --> 1959.75
how is it ridiculous what about the Flat

1956.96 --> 1963.73
Earth makes it impossible or ridiculous

1959.75 --> 1963.73
could you please detail that perhaps

1975.98 --> 1981.32
because I know you'll live yeahi ballers

1979.01 --> 1983.51
and newcomers typically you like to say

1981.32 --> 1986.51
well it doesn't work on the flatter or

1983.51 --> 1988.549
the really and then they go and describe

1986.51 --> 1990.919
something that just does not address

1988.549 --> 1994.3899999999999
anything about the Flat Earth in the

1990.919 --> 1997.5800000000002
first instance so it's a total straw man

1994.39 --> 2000.01
it's just a blank assertion and then no

1997.58 --> 2002.85
connection to that actual assertion it's

2000.01 --> 2006.1299999999999
it's getting kind of annoying and

2002.85 --> 2009.76
disappointing you because I'd I'd be

2006.13 --> 2012.15
interested to have some real aspect in

2009.76 --> 2014.7
some way of a Flat Earth model

2012.15 --> 2017.5300000000002
conceptualization actually be tested

2014.7 --> 2021.3300000000002
they can't do it anymore the ballers can

2017.53 --> 2024.1299999999999
do it they lost track because they just

2021.33 --> 2026.77
there are too much into presuppositional

2024.13 --> 2029.3200000000002
beliefs so their mind just doesn't even

2026.77 --> 2033.72
reach that far it in order to figure out

2029.32 --> 2033.72
what we're actually working on

2041.16 --> 2047.13
well I don't know he have a I think I

2044.37 --> 2049.5
think I caught you saying that - I just

2047.13 --> 2051.899
didn't pick up on the details so that I

2049.5 --> 2053.79
just described most ballers had to do

2051.899 --> 2055.62
that you know it doesn't mean that it's

2053.79 --> 2059.1
necessarily nefarious it's just so

2055.62 --> 2061.2
typical it's like oh I just don't see

2059.1 --> 2064.56
how it works on your flat or it's like

2061.2 --> 2067.31
and then describe something that has no

2064.56 --> 2070.02
relation to any kind of flat earth model

2067.31 --> 2073.11
conceptualization whatsoever and it's

2070.02 --> 2076.2599999999998
like that every time what about P

2073.11 --> 2078.9900000000002
suppose that flat earth makes something

2076.26 --> 2081.69
impossible that you're thinking of why

2078.99 --> 2085.25
don't you try to describe that actually

2081.69 --> 2087.81
tie it win this with the flat earth now

2085.25 --> 2089.61
people have done this before especially

2087.81 --> 2091.679
the wind concerns with the the globe of

2089.61 --> 2095.46
the heavens with the heavenly lights Sun

2091.679 --> 2098.7000000000003
Moon it's like are the these stars over

2095.46 --> 2102.0
there and why can't you see the Sun

2098.7 --> 2106.02
everywhere on on a flat earth you should

2102.0 --> 2108.54
see the Sun everywhere at all times okay

2106.02 --> 2111.36
yeah you know Sean Hawkins is constantly

2108.54 --> 2115.62
copy-pasting that type of nonsense okay

2111.36 --> 2118.31
at least that is an attempt to point at

2115.62 --> 2120.21
something about a flat earth

2118.31 --> 2121.68
conceptualization and saying what you

2120.21 --> 2124.85
think can't work on it now it's

2121.68 --> 2128.85
completely [ __ ] and outdated and

2124.85 --> 2132.33
hugely oversimplified cardboard cutout

2128.85 --> 2136.1
model of a flat earth that he's straw

2132.33 --> 2138.96
Manning with but at least it's something

2136.1 --> 2140.31
that actually ties into some kind of

2138.96 --> 2142.26
conceptualization of a Flat Earth

2140.31 --> 2144.99
instead of just saying now I think it's

2142.26 --> 2149.8700000000003
ridiculous and then not talking about it

2144.99 --> 2149.87
and going on to something else you know

2158.579 --> 2167.9100000000003
really that's an odd thing to say you

2165.7 --> 2167.91
have

2173.19 --> 2177.4500000000003
why wouldn't you have the mental

2175.02 --> 2182.43
capacity to imagine a flat earth it's

2177.45 --> 2188.9399999999996
really not that difficult you know it

2182.43 --> 2191.6299999999997
really isn't technically to fulfill a

2188.94 --> 2194.19
full scale conceptualization of the

2191.63 --> 2195.6600000000003
heliocentric model outer space universe

2194.19 --> 2200.2200000000003
with everything that comes with it is

2195.66 --> 2203.43
much more out of control insane it's

2200.22 --> 2205.5299999999997
much harder to really get everything

2203.43 --> 2208.319
straight in such a conceptualization in

2205.53 --> 2211.4700000000003
order to put down something that is

2208.319 --> 2213.06
halfway viable or believable it's much

2211.47 --> 2215.16
more difficult with the heliocentric

2213.06 --> 2217.38
model than it is in some kind of Flat

2215.16 --> 2220.23
Earth conceptualization because the Flat

2217.38 --> 2223.109
Earth is pretty basic it's just this

2220.23 --> 2225.66
realm it's just like yeah the mysterious

2223.109 --> 2229.68
design of this realm what's going on how

2225.66 --> 2237.0
it works how mistakes have fill yeah

2229.68 --> 2238.56
come in to fill in all that but yeah the

2237.0 --> 2240.119
lights in the skies are just lights

2238.56 --> 2242.19
they're just light manifests and we

2240.119 --> 2244.65
don't really know how and there's even

2242.19 --> 2247.02
uncertainties about the idea that they

2244.65 --> 2249.42
might be literal positioned lights in

2247.02 --> 2252.03
some way I think they're not so it's

2249.42 --> 2254.579
much more about the confusion and the

2252.03 --> 2257.7000000000003
puzzle of what is all relatively close

2254.579 --> 2261.8100000000004
by and just the mysterious nature of

2257.7 --> 2264.319
creation the design how does it work how

2261.81 --> 2267.18
can that work what's going on and

2264.319 --> 2269.599
psychology how does our mind reflect on

2267.18 --> 2273.75
these things this is almost just as much

2269.599 --> 2278.25
to learn there as just the actual design

2273.75 --> 2283.79
of things but it's not that difficult to

2278.25 --> 2283.79
just imagine it like that come on

2298.2 --> 2304.0789999999997
because it is so far away from what is

2300.72 --> 2307.2
considered the gospel okay well maybe

2304.079 --> 2309.75
then it doesn't have to do with your

2307.2 --> 2312.6899999999996
actual comprehension ability maybe it's

2309.75 --> 2318.829
just that you it's more a feeling thing

2312.69 --> 2325.02
you just can't you can't touch it it's

2318.829 --> 2331.3390000000004
it yeah it feels too too alien whatever

2325.02 --> 2334.349
to two different in a way it must be

2331.339 --> 2337.7999999999997
like a completely different culture and

2334.349 --> 2340.26
what like yeah like you are just in a

2337.8 --> 2342.57
completely type of foreign belief that's

2340.26 --> 2347.4
probably feeling wise how how you

2342.57 --> 2350.2200000000003
perceive it right it was like that to me

2347.4 --> 2352.92
in a way except for me it's like wow

2350.22 --> 2354.81
this is absolutely astounding and

2352.92 --> 2356.55
amazing but I can't take this freaking

2354.81 --> 2358.2
responsibility of the insight that it

2356.55 --> 2360.119
brings and that's really what happened

2358.2 --> 2368.819
to me a lot of the times earlier on and

2360.119 --> 2371.579
now I'm embracing it fully but I don't

2368.819 --> 2374.94
get it like if you're really following

2371.579 --> 2376.9500000000003
me here you watch my show okay

2374.94 --> 2380.25
on a daily basis that's already pretty

2376.95 --> 2386.73
weird for a baller when you don't

2380.25 --> 2390.3
understand it because how can you follow

2386.73 --> 2394.77
me on a daily basis and not still not

2390.3 --> 2398.9700000000003
get something as like this is how the

2394.77 --> 2400.89
Flat Earth model or a model or how yeah

2398.97 --> 2406.0499999999997
what we know of reality the things that

2400.89 --> 2408.569
are there and like rough models of it of

2406.05 --> 2412.05
what could be or of what we think it's

2408.569 --> 2413.849
likely yeah where it is how it works but

2412.05 --> 2416.52
we don't know with certainty is because

2413.849 --> 2420.06
there are just open questions that

2416.52 --> 2425.0099999999998
haven't been answered yet and that's

2420.06 --> 2428.39
what we go with in a way it is kind of

2425.01 --> 2430.619
like starting science off from scratch

2428.39 --> 2431.7
doing it all over again from the

2430.619 --> 2435.089
beginning

2431.7 --> 2437.0989999999997
and funnily enough that's actually what

2435.089 --> 2438.42
you're supposed to do with science with

2437.099 --> 2440.73
the scientific method that's always

2438.42 --> 2444.39
always was meant to be to build

2440.73 --> 2447.3
everything on repeatable experiments so

2444.39 --> 2451.6189999999997
that science and scientists would always

2447.3 --> 2455.03
be able to completely repeat everything

2451.619 --> 2458.04
that was ever scientifically done and

2455.03 --> 2461.099
literally become every learning process

2458.04 --> 2463.77
every aspect of it because the

2461.099 --> 2468.089
repetition of all experiments that are

2463.77 --> 2470.31
really good X that are viable

2468.089 --> 2473.849
experiments that they can be repeated

2470.31 --> 2478.38
well this has been changed

2473.849 --> 2479.13
culturally by the heliocentric and their

2478.38 --> 2481.73
influence

2479.13 --> 2484.77
they changed science to step away from

2481.73 --> 2487.829
repeatable scientific experiment viable

2484.77 --> 2491.03
scientific experiment and just observe

2487.829 --> 2494.849
and declare type of situations and

2491.03 --> 2497.3100000000004
because of that yeah science has

2494.849 --> 2499.92
basically been abandoned in the

2497.31 --> 2502.68
mainstream in the official it's

2499.92 --> 2504.7200000000003
officially been abandoned it's just not

2502.68 --> 2506.97
mentioned it's not like open a billboard

2504.72 --> 2509.25
it has been abandoned it's just like now

2506.97 --> 2511.589
we people just say now we don't do that

2509.25 --> 2513.69
anymore you don't need to do that we

2511.589 --> 2515.67
don't need to use a scientific method

2513.69 --> 2518.75
just do it slightly different with just

2515.67 --> 2521.52
the spirit of the philosophical

2518.75 --> 2523.77
approaches now it could definitely be

2521.52 --> 2527.099
something else we're just not gonna do

2523.77 --> 2531.75
it exactly as is as always has been no

2527.099 --> 2534.27
and that has happened so now after I've

2531.75 --> 2536.25
pretty much discovered that what I'm

2534.27 --> 2539.06
doing what a lot of the flat-earthers

2536.25 --> 2544.2
are trying to do at least in some way is

2539.06 --> 2549.21
from scratch rebuild based on scientific

2544.2 --> 2552.47
data natural law all that and ideas

2549.21 --> 2556.109
conceptions and just start from scratch

2552.47 --> 2559.77
start at all and as we go we just figure

2556.109 --> 2563.7999999999997
out how many nonsense has slept in how

2559.77 --> 2566.17
many science fiction has become

2563.8 --> 2571.3
like a subconsciously accepted

2566.17 --> 2572.92
scientific fact like just think about

2571.3 --> 2575.1400000000003
the idea of a black hole

2572.92 --> 2577.84
it's almost nobody in the world that

2575.14 --> 2580.2999999999997
doesn't know what that is even though it

2577.84 --> 2585.36
is purely a concept and now that science

2580.3 --> 2588.94
fiction becoming science fact through

2585.36 --> 2590.9500000000003
consensus but it's not actually science

2588.94 --> 2593.25
fact there's nothing about it that's

2590.95 --> 2596.25
proven it's a purely mathematical

2593.25 --> 2596.25
conception

2612.57 --> 2616.28
what question then

2617.65 --> 2621.119
I don't know what you're talking about

2640.77 --> 2646.65
difference in the glass yeah of course

2643.21 --> 2646.65
there is yes

2651.07 --> 2657.9
all right because tungsten is a very

2653.35 --> 2660.91
heavy gas it will as long as it doesn't

2657.9 --> 2662.14
gradually mix in which gases do over

2660.91 --> 2665.29
time because they do move in all

2662.14 --> 2668.0499999999997
directions right at first when you pour

2665.29 --> 2670.3
it in that glass is going to be a

2668.05 --> 2674.17
container the excess fluoride is and the

2670.3 --> 2677.5600000000004
glass together are surrounded by air

2674.17 --> 2681.07
which is less dense than then that yes

2677.56 --> 2686.56
that tungsten hexafluoride so it's gonna

2681.07 --> 2689.9500000000003
effectively push because it wants to be

2686.56 --> 2693.25
below the air that surrounds the whole

2689.95 --> 2695.98
thing so it's gonna create more weight

2693.25 --> 2697.81
weight is an extracted concept but it's

2695.98 --> 2700.39
effectively gonna have more weight

2697.81 --> 2702.82
temporarily as long as tax of fluoride

2700.39 --> 2710.7999999999997
is still unmixed with the air around it

2702.82 --> 2714.03
in that glass that's right so I don't

2710.8 --> 2719.26
again you bring in a flat earth model

2714.03 --> 2720.75
whatever what on the flat earth see you

2719.26 --> 2723.4300000000003
did it again

2720.75 --> 2725.44
you bring up something with the gas and

2723.43 --> 2728.0699999999997
then you just say would work on a flat

2725.44 --> 2732.76
earth and how how does that relate to

2728.07 --> 2739.0
anything anything concerning flat earth

2732.76 --> 2741.07
it's just you just stick it on there can

2739.0 --> 2743.44
you measure this changing weight yes of

2741.07 --> 2746.4700000000003
course you can if you put the thing on a

2743.44 --> 2749.4700000000003
scale yeah it will probably weigh a

2746.47 --> 2753.25
little more with that gas in it instead

2749.47 --> 2755.56
of just air might be minut amount I

2753.25 --> 2760.44
don't know how much heavier it is even

2755.56 --> 2760.44
than in regular air I don't know

2765.839 --> 2771.749
but what is the deal why-why-why bring

2770.069 --> 2779.519
this up what does this have to do with

2771.749 --> 2782.6989999999996
anything are you saying that it working

2779.519 --> 2783.8999999999996
like that somehow disproves relative

2782.699 --> 2786.119
density theory that it is a

2783.9 --> 2789.599
contradiction to relative density

2786.119 --> 2792.9590000000003
workings I just explained to you exactly

2789.599 --> 2795.1800000000003
what would happen and how and why

2792.959 --> 2798.019
through relative density theory so what

2795.18 --> 2798.019
is the problem of that

2817.77 --> 2825.6
you weren't asking anything you were

2823.71 --> 2832.08
just stating something I don't see any

2825.6 --> 2834.81
question work and you said can you

2832.08 --> 2840.08
measure this change in weight and I said

2834.81 --> 2840.08
yes did you not hear me

2861.68 --> 2864.7
anything else

2870.2 --> 2873.2799999999997
[Music]

2878.19 --> 2882.15
I'm in need for some lunch

2884.519 --> 2891.3999999999996
mmm by the way I do appreciate it yeah

2889.029 --> 2894.43
don't mind if I seem to get an order

2891.4 --> 2897.73
whatever I really appreciate having some

2894.43 --> 2899.89
some moderate ballers in my chat

2897.73 --> 2901.509
bringing out these questions because

2899.89 --> 2904.9
yeah that makes me talk about Flat Earth

2901.509 --> 2911.079
a lot and I appreciate the opportunity

2904.9 --> 2913.4700000000003
to do that at times and today is one of

2911.079 --> 2913.4700000000003
those times

2922.869 --> 2930.1600000000003
no no that's not what I said that's not

2927.17 --> 2930.16
what I said London

2936.75 --> 2943.59
Thanks good servant I do my best I've

2939.43 --> 2948.2799999999997
had some practice but no Landon

2943.59 --> 2950.08
different I have said that there is

2948.28 --> 2952.36
different gases that separate in

2950.08 --> 2956.41
different layers which is why we have

2952.36 --> 2958.78
different pressure at elevation no no no

2956.41 --> 2962.91
no I just set there yeah there is

2958.78 --> 2966.34
different gases they will eventually if

2962.91 --> 2970.6
there is not enough influence we'll get

2966.34 --> 2975.28
to there yeah their equilibrium point in

2970.6 --> 2979.2999999999997
the spectrum of all things right along

2975.28 --> 2984.6600000000003
the alignment heavier down lighter up

2979.3 --> 2987.94
and they will settle in their respective

2984.66 --> 2991.98
equilibrium points roughly but since it

2987.94 --> 2995.32
is gaseous and since gases despite being

2991.98 --> 2997.93
subjected to relative density despite

2995.32 --> 3003.21
that they still tend to just move around

2997.93 --> 3006.96
and mix up so that's why you yeah it's

3003.21 --> 3010.2200000000003
never a a compartment a chamber with

3006.96 --> 3012.93
different gases is probably never gonna

3010.22 --> 3014.58
perfectly split up

3012.93 --> 3017.1
it's never gonna settle in such a way

3014.58 --> 3019.17
that it is completely unmixed I don't

3017.1 --> 3021.66
think that would happen because it is

3019.17 --> 3026.1
gases it will kind of spread out so

3021.66 --> 3028.3799999999997
there may be radiation but it's gonna be

3026.1 --> 3030.87
as I said before it's gonna be mixed in

3028.38 --> 3033.81
it's never gonna be this pure layer like

3030.87 --> 3037.5899999999997
for example with oil and water and all

3033.81 --> 3039.89
that which by the way have surfaces that

3037.59 --> 3043.1400000000003
repel each other so that's an extra

3039.89 --> 3046.29
effect that helps that separation

3043.14 --> 3047.7
between those substances gases don't do

3046.29 --> 3051.41
that gases just move in all directions

3047.7 --> 3051.41
and they mix in with one another

3055.61 --> 3061.4100000000003
what force pushes down in relative

3058.86 --> 3064.08
density that's very simple relative

3061.41 --> 3069.99
density disequilibrium and it doesn't

3064.08 --> 3074.5099999999998
push down or up it there is yeah it's

3069.99 --> 3078.12
relative and hey if something dense is

3074.51 --> 3080.13
at a very much less dense surrounding if

3078.12 --> 3082.68
it's high up it wants to go to the more

3080.13 --> 3086.01
dense part of the spectrum of all things

3082.68 --> 3090.3599999999997
and which will be down so it will move

3086.01 --> 3096.2700000000004
down and if something is less dense like

3090.36 --> 3101.4500000000003
a helium balloon it will push up to move

3096.27 --> 3101.45
to its relative density equilibrium

3107.35 --> 3113.92
well no it's not entirely true though it

3110.41 --> 3117.19
does relative deaths equilibrium

3113.92 --> 3121.15
relative density disequilibrium force is

3117.19 --> 3123.91
a force and it does push its provably

3121.15 --> 3128.32
there there is acceleration that happens

3123.91 --> 3132.58
as soon as maneuverability is like

3128.32 --> 3136.86
released so for example you hold

3132.58 --> 3142.5099999999998
something whenever you hold something I

3136.86 --> 3145.9300000000003
got it held up so I am now taking the

3142.51 --> 3148.36
the object's relative density this

3145.93 --> 3152.3799999999997
equilibrium force which is like this

3148.36 --> 3154.78
push down I'm and I'm taking that with

3152.38 --> 3157.7200000000003
my arm I'm taking effectively the extra

3154.78 --> 3161.77
weight if I let it go it will start to

3157.72 --> 3164.77
accelerate down so there is a force

3161.77 --> 3168.88
there and as when that relative dense

3164.77 --> 3170.41
the density disequilibrium force when

3168.88 --> 3173.17
there is no maneuverability like when I

3170.41 --> 3175.45
gripped it then that force will

3173.17 --> 3178.9
translate into pressure in that

3175.45 --> 3180.4199999999996
direction on whenever is holding it back

3178.9 --> 3184.1800000000003
from maneuvering

3180.42 --> 3187.69
that's how relative density works there

3184.18 --> 3189.6699999999996
is motion acceleration with plenty of

3187.69 --> 3194.4700000000003
maneuverability until it is stopped and

3189.67 --> 3197.4700000000003
then when it can no longer maneuver that

3194.47 --> 3199.8399999999997
relative density this equilibrium force

3197.47 --> 3202.87
will translate itself into local

3199.84 --> 3205.86
pressure and that's just how it works

3202.87 --> 3205.8599999999997
it's provable

3210.35 --> 3213.8399999999997
[Music]

3219.079 --> 3222.829
what are you talking about

3230.67 --> 3237.64
okay well yeah my hobby I guess have

3236.17 --> 3240.4
kind of a point although I don't know

3237.64 --> 3244.14
why he had to put the pedophiles in

3240.4 --> 3246.64
there it is probably true you know but I

3244.14 --> 3248.92
think that the pedophile issue is

3246.64 --> 3253.23
probably just secondary to the overall

3248.92 --> 3253.23
implications of what Jesuits really do I

3254.07 --> 3260.32
wouldn't have mentioned it in there as

3256.21 --> 3263.29
well and I would prefer if people kind

3260.32 --> 3268.3900000000003
of like don't bring that kind of thing

3263.29 --> 3272.92
up unless it is like very specifically

3268.39 --> 3277.859
about something that is like that has

3272.92 --> 3277.859
come up or whatever anyway

3303.44 --> 3310.64
hmmm I think I'm gonna yeah it's okay

3307.099 --> 3313.039
Tenzin everyone you know in a way it is

3310.64 --> 3315.3799999999997
to me every time people use that kind of

3313.039 --> 3317.599
thing it is about desensitization it is

3315.38 --> 3320.78
just because they're being overexposed

3317.599 --> 3324.049
with like as the feathers everywhere and

3320.78 --> 3326.9
this and that and satanic rituals and

3324.049 --> 3329.21
drinking and like really disgusting [ __ ]

3326.9 --> 3331.369
when you get overexposed by that then

3329.21 --> 3333.53
you become desensitized by it and you

3331.369 --> 3335.63
just start to drop it because you think

3333.53 --> 3337.67
it's relevant information but

3335.63 --> 3340.9100000000003
overlooking because it has numbed you

3337.67 --> 3344.27
down you just don't feel that anymore as

3340.91 --> 3348.3799999999997
much you stop realizing that to

3344.27 --> 3351.98
outsiders that's like very painful it

3348.38 --> 3353.539
doesn't just flow as easy when you drop

3351.98 --> 3358.76
something like that in between there

3353.539 --> 3360.7990000000004
unless you build it in with with care so

3358.76 --> 3363.1400000000003
that when people read it they realize

3360.799 --> 3366.799
that you realize how much impact it

3363.14 --> 3369.3489999999997
makes see that's part of well it is also

3366.799 --> 3371.869
a big issue with sivanna syndrome it's

3369.349 --> 3375.17
just this overexposure of disgusting

3371.869 --> 3377.9300000000003
[ __ ] makes you forget that when you're

3375.17 --> 3380.66
not constantly exposed by that it makes

3377.93 --> 3385.3689999999997
a huge impact and that you should take

3380.66 --> 3387.3489999999997
care with that and not just hammer all

3385.369 --> 3394.25
that insane stuff on people because

3387.349 --> 3397.19
they're not gonna respond well right so

3394.25 --> 3398.829
but I'm gonna run out the show flatter

3397.19 --> 3402.109
if the basis has already started up so

3398.829 --> 3403.67
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

3402.109 --> 3406.19
you liked the show I thought it was very

3403.67 --> 3409.2200000000003
interesting lots of talk about flat

3406.19 --> 3412.069
earth this time and back and forth with

3409.22 --> 3416.1189999999997
ballers and also thank you for the

3412.069 --> 3417.71
support again if you got something to

3416.119 --> 3421.789
spare Guns of Navarone I would really

3417.71 --> 3425.66
appreciate it could use it baking baking

3421.789 --> 3427.1600000000003
whatever and anyway I thought it was a

3425.66 --> 3429.41
good show if you liked it then please

3427.16 --> 3430.7889999999998
don't forget to Rogen's it up and if you

3429.41 --> 3432.41
haven't already subscribed to my channel

3430.789 --> 3433.73
and hit the bell notification so you

3432.41 --> 3435.77
know when i'm going live which is

3433.73 --> 3436.88
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

3435.77 --> 3439.369
day

3436.88 --> 3441.289
please also do support me for the paypal

3439.369 --> 3444.44
patron my GoFundMe the super chat and

3441.289 --> 3446.3590000000004
the membership system if you want if you

3444.44 --> 3448.16
can they'll be much appreciated and

3446.359 --> 3450.2
it'll keep me going

3448.16 --> 3451.7889999999998
I'll be back tomorrow with Flat Earth or

3450.2 --> 3453.3489999999997
the rhythm of five hundred and twenty

3451.789 --> 3455.7200000000003
nine and I'm gonna join the feathers

3453.349 --> 3459.8590000000004
debates right now it's already started

3455.72 --> 3463.729
up so yeah hashtag MIFA indeed uber moco

3459.859 --> 3466.479
and Steve and until the next video keep

3463.729 --> 3466.479
it flat

3466.78 --> 3489.679
