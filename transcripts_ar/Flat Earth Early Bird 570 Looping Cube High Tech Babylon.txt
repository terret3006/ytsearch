70.159 --> 76.32000000000001
uh the weather today is what it

73.28 --> 76.799
seems kind of the same as yesterday but

76.32 --> 80.479
it's

76.799 --> 81.60000000000001
actually kind of raining all the time

80.479 --> 84.96
now

81.6 --> 86.55999999999999
it there's just it just became a little

84.96 --> 90.88
bit dry

86.56 --> 94.159
but it's like constantly dripping and

90.88 --> 102.479
very moist but still warm

94.159 --> 102.47900000000001
so yeah what it is

106.399 --> 109.119
right so

112.32 --> 117.439
i got turmeric coffee with me today

117.84 --> 124.24000000000001
and green tea let's see who is in chat

124.56 --> 132.479
all right okay so ajm was first again

128.0 --> 132.479
amanda young steve missouri bear

133.04 --> 138.07999999999998
good servant oprah mukul

138.8 --> 145.59900000000002
tom parker robin stanley

142.56 --> 145.599
yeah good to see you all

149.36 --> 157.68
right so yeah i'm a little bit uh i know

156.319 --> 160.79999999999998
a little bit stressed

157.68 --> 162.239
because i just got in the bill today

160.8 --> 164.56
for something that's going to be a

162.239 --> 165.59900000000002
monthly occurrence and probably grown

164.56 --> 167.76
worse

165.599 --> 169.83999999999997
for the new storage that's just on my

167.76 --> 172.959
name

169.84 --> 178.56
yeah it's costing 75 euros at this point

172.959 --> 178.56
and yeah knew that was coming

179.84 --> 185.68
i'm gonna have to somehow make it fit so

184.239 --> 189.84
yeah so i still got a

185.68 --> 190.87900000000002
a buffer also for the air filter that's

189.84 --> 193.44
kind of like in

190.879 --> 193.44
in the weight

194.4 --> 199.76000000000002
and i hope things uh the support keeps

197.76 --> 203.2
rolling in i hope i'm i'm worth it

199.76 --> 205.35999999999999
i'm i hope i'm still worthwhile spending

203.2 --> 205.35999999999999
on

205.92 --> 209.35999999999999
because i do have ups and downs you know

208.879 --> 212.72
and

209.36 --> 215.04000000000002
or rather just moments where i'm intense

212.72 --> 217.68
and do a lot of stuff whether it is like

215.04 --> 221.12
explaining negative things or

217.68 --> 223.20000000000002
being really energetic positive things

221.12 --> 224.72
or sometimes i'm just silent and i'm

223.2 --> 227.04
like

224.72 --> 228.239
yeah only thing that's on my mind is are

227.04 --> 230.959
things that i just don't

228.239 --> 233.519
really want to share because it's not

230.959 --> 235.599
going to be any good

233.519 --> 237.76
and that's usually when i stand tend to

235.599 --> 242.319
stay silent

237.76 --> 242.319
or unless i'm just really hot and tired

244.799 --> 247.04000000000002
but

250.159 --> 253.599
yeah i think i listened back yesterday's

252.959 --> 255.519
hangout

253.599 --> 257.84
i haven't listened to my own shows for a

255.519 --> 257.84000000000003
while

259.519 --> 264.96
maybe it is because i remember the parts

262.56 --> 267.04
where i didn't really like what what it

264.96 --> 270.15999999999997
was like at the time being

267.04 --> 272.32
but yeah you know over the year

270.16 --> 274.40000000000003
watching back my show i usually find out

272.32 --> 278.0
that

274.4 --> 281.35999999999996
pilots pauses that i thought were just

278.0 --> 283.52
unbearably long like this is intolerable

281.36 --> 284.47900000000004
turn out in reality when i'm just

283.52 --> 286.639
watching back to

284.479 --> 288.24
not be that long so it's weird how kind

286.639 --> 293.199
of my personal experience of

288.24 --> 295.52
doing it is somewhat discontorted from

293.199 --> 296.8
well from a third perspective actually

295.52 --> 300.0
watching it it's

296.8 --> 300.0
it's odd how that works

307.759 --> 311.28000000000003
missouri bear if it'll make you feel

309.759 --> 312.96000000000004
better i'm not going anywhere well

311.28 --> 316.15999999999997
thanks missouri bear

312.96 --> 316.15999999999997
i do appreciate it

317.84 --> 325.11999999999995
maybe it's also these underpants

321.44 --> 328.32
i got new shorts

325.12 --> 330.96
ugh and

328.32 --> 332.639
that's what they're called right and

330.96 --> 334.71999999999997
yeah i don't know because the old ones

332.639 --> 337.6
were just

334.72 --> 338.96000000000004
getting too old and raggedy the

337.6 --> 341.28000000000003
elastic's all

338.96 --> 342.23999999999995
overly stretched and [ __ ] but the yeah

341.28 --> 344.71999999999997
it's

342.24 --> 347.12
newest one fit perfectly i'm not gonna

344.72 --> 351.03900000000004
show it

347.12 --> 353.84000000000003
but it is still taking some getting used

351.039 --> 353.84
to

358.319 --> 362.24
but i'm glad i did it and i got the new

360.24 --> 366.56
short shirt

362.24 --> 368.88
so and it didn't cost me too much

366.56 --> 368.88
hmm

373.039 --> 377.36
right i i just finished watching the

377.68 --> 383.039
i didn't know karen beats new project

380.96 --> 384.0
some other girls the witches brew

383.039 --> 386.56
episode two

384.0 --> 387.919
or i watched both of them so i skipped

386.56 --> 391.12
them

387.919 --> 391.12
it was kind of interesting

392.639 --> 397.199
it's a this is typically what i'd expect

402.56 --> 408.319
and big bear yesterday was good again

405.759 --> 409.84000000000003
that's what i remember although i think

408.319 --> 411.599
yeah what i do also remember is you got

409.84 --> 414.79999999999995
a bit flustered with the piano

411.599 --> 418.24
it happens sometimes it's funny in a way

414.8 --> 422.24
it's like real life honest mistakes

418.24 --> 425.68
and yeah

422.24 --> 425.68
it just shows that it's real

427.68 --> 431.44
oh oh nice thanks

432.08 --> 438.08
thanks for guns of nephron rmp looking

435.36 --> 438.08000000000004
forward to it

441.28 --> 444.479
wait i think i still got

445.68 --> 451.919
all right yeah

448.8 --> 455.52000000000004
for a change i opened the

451.919 --> 455.52
the a discord panel

456.319 --> 461.03900000000004
just in some random room and i don't

459.039 --> 462.8
know maybe you know i could just get

461.039 --> 467.039
into a conversation because

462.8 --> 471.599
in a way it's almost like i'm jealous

467.039 --> 473.759
now of other streams where people just

471.599 --> 474.87899999999996
are having conversations with each other

473.759 --> 478.16
with each other

474.879 --> 479.68
a lot and i kind of miss that

478.16 --> 481.199
because i do have my daily show and i

479.68 --> 484.40000000000003
talk every day

481.199 --> 486.40000000000003
but that kind of drains me a little

484.4 --> 488.0
sometimes it invigorates me it drains me

486.4 --> 491.28
a little on average

488.0 --> 495.68
conversational energy

491.28 --> 498.79999999999995
and yeah

495.68 --> 500.40000000000003
it's just like on the flat of the base

498.8 --> 502.319
it doesn't really

500.4 --> 503.919
always work that well either you know

502.319 --> 505.68
sometimes there's these moments where

503.919 --> 508.0
just have the room and just do something

505.68 --> 512.24
and it works a lot of the times

508.0 --> 514.08
it's just like work like

512.24 --> 515.519
get a little creative if you can with

514.08 --> 518.5600000000001
the

515.519 --> 519.279
with the housekeeping questions and then

518.56 --> 521.8389999999999
it's just

519.279 --> 525.279
like yeah going through the subjects

521.839 --> 527.2
until a baller comes in and then it's

525.279 --> 529.12
yeah if i get lucky maybe a couple of

527.2 --> 531.76
dicks but eventually

529.12 --> 533.68
yeah it's gonna turn into nathan just

531.76 --> 535.76
really cracking down on that and you

533.68 --> 538.8
can't really get in between that

535.76 --> 541.36
as chocolate experienced yesterday

538.8 --> 544.8
again this is chocolate seems to be

541.36 --> 548.8000000000001
going through an arwanian face

544.8 --> 550.4799999999999
in a way if i may dare call it that

548.8 --> 552.399
because he's getting a lot of shut up

550.48 --> 554.08
chocolate now

552.399 --> 557.279
because he wants to get involved the

554.08 --> 561.6800000000001
chocolate doesn't have his own show

557.279 --> 563.92
right but yeah that's what it is and

561.68 --> 564.7199999999999
it's still worth it to me even though

563.92 --> 566.8
some people

564.72 --> 568.1600000000001
that are fans of mine like amanda young

566.8 --> 570.959
doesn't seem to like the flat earth

568.16 --> 570.959
debates anymore

572.08 --> 574.32
but

575.6 --> 579.9200000000001
yeah on the other hand maybe as a

578.0 --> 582.16
watcher at some point you get a bit

579.92 --> 585.279
tired of it

582.16 --> 586.8
and then yeah you get sick of it and

585.279 --> 588.399
then you don't watch it for a while and

586.8 --> 591.92
then at some point

588.399 --> 594.32
it'll probably get interesting again so

591.92 --> 595.5999999999999
it was for me like that too like in a

594.32 --> 597.9200000000001
way

595.6 --> 600.0
i try to always be there but sometimes i

597.92 --> 603.4399999999999
really don't feel like it

600.0 --> 604.32
i'm going there anyway and then i'll

603.44 --> 607.7600000000001
just

604.32 --> 609.519
not get as involved as much

607.76 --> 611.68
because i go there because i i want to

609.519 --> 612.8
go there and i feel i'm supposed to be

611.68 --> 616.16
there

612.8 --> 616.16
i'm expected in a way

616.959 --> 619.8389999999999
and yeah

623.12 --> 628.24
i want to be considered reliable

628.56 --> 632.959
it's very important to me so my personal

631.6 --> 636.0790000000001
struggles

632.959 --> 637.1999999999999
in the past especially so yeah i'm just

636.079 --> 640.56
gonna keep on going

637.2 --> 642.8000000000001
until it's like clear that

640.56 --> 644.4799999999999
that it's over but i don't know i don't

642.8 --> 647.1999999999999
see that coming you know i thought that

644.48 --> 650.0
was gonna come at some point

647.2 --> 651.36
and there have been bump-ins but when i

650.0 --> 653.04
get sick of it or when

651.36 --> 655.2
we get sick of each other or something

653.04 --> 657.4399999999999
or i hit a note really wrong and i can't

655.2 --> 658.9590000000001
reattune to the group and then i have to

657.44 --> 662.399
step away

658.959 --> 665.5999999999999
social dynamics but

662.399 --> 666.32
yeah i get very drama dramatic when it

665.6 --> 669.519
happens

666.32 --> 674.48
not except necessarily expressive

669.519 --> 678.0
dramatic but inside it's like oh god

674.48 --> 680.0790000000001
like that's just really bad on me and

678.0 --> 681.04
like triggers my imagination in a bad

680.079 --> 683.68
way

681.04 --> 684.8
get really paranoid unnecessarily from

683.68 --> 686.88
experience i know

684.8 --> 688.64
on average it's it's exaggerated in my

686.88 --> 692.56
mind but it still

688.64 --> 695.8389999999999
can be nasty and it's not

692.56 --> 697.01
the fault of people

695.839 --> 700.12
so yeah

697.01 --> 700.12
[Music]

700.32 --> 705.279
and yeah it happened now like three four

702.399 --> 707.68
times something and it's all fine

705.279 --> 708.399
not anything anytime recent by the way

707.68 --> 713.04
so it's not

708.399 --> 713.04
relating to anything happening recently

714.32 --> 717.9200000000001
your goal is to have beehives robin

716.959 --> 721.92
stanley

717.92 --> 721.92
well that's a very interesting goal

722.88 --> 732.8
bees are awesome if you want bees

726.639 --> 732.8
then you got it yeah get flower fields

732.959 --> 736.56
for that hey nothing bad about flower

735.839 --> 739.7600000000001
fields right

736.56 --> 745.8389999999999
unless maybe you're you have

739.76 --> 745.8389999999999
strong hay fever or something

746.72 --> 749.9200000000001
but yeah fantastic

755.76 --> 759.8389999999999
i think that

763.6 --> 767.9200000000001
no i don't know anything too much about

765.76 --> 773.8389999999999
it what i was thinking i think there's a

767.92 --> 773.8389999999999
beehive like here across the river

774.0 --> 777.279
i think i've seen one there

780.959 --> 785.04
so as long as there's plenty of green

782.72 --> 785.0400000000001
around

785.44 --> 791.6800000000001
and maybe some streaming water

788.56 --> 794.079
yeah bees that's really awesome to have

791.68 --> 794.079
i think

795.12 --> 799.6
it's like a win-win situation you can

798.32 --> 803.0400000000001
potentially get honey

799.6 --> 804.88
and you yeah nature flourishes with it

803.04 --> 814.959
especially the beautiful nature and the

804.88 --> 817.279
berries and all that

814.959 --> 817.279
all right

818.48 --> 823.6
oh great september you bought jogging

820.8 --> 829.8389999999999
pants with the nasa logo on it

823.6 --> 829.839
oh good for you

830.16 --> 836.959
you know i used to have a transformers

833.36 --> 843.839
g1 series bed sheets

836.959 --> 843.8389999999999
those were really awesome too

848.16 --> 860.3689999999999
i had them when i was like eight

857.22 --> 860.369
[Music]

868.839 --> 874.5390000000001
hmm

870.52 --> 874.539
[Music]

874.88 --> 882.8389999999999
ah tom parker no no it wasn't bees

878.88 --> 884.56
no it's bumblebees bumblebees are

882.839 --> 888.0790000000001
illogical

884.56 --> 893.279
because of their size weight and wing

888.079 --> 893.279
size no bees are fine

897.36 --> 913.839
and there's a lot of beetles by the way

899.12 --> 913.839
like that as well

924.72 --> 927.839
all right correct uh

928.24 --> 934.9590000000001
never heard about a bill no

931.68 --> 938.56
really but it's like one of those

934.959 --> 941.3599999999999
typical things in the information

938.56 --> 942.959
out there about the beetle wings

941.36 --> 946.5600000000001
remember

942.959 --> 950.16
that they have this weird electrostatic

946.56 --> 952.8389999999999
effect and all that

950.16 --> 955.8389999999999
that's how they do it it's like a

952.839 --> 955.839
electrostatics

960.399 --> 963.6
and i think like did didn't spiders also

963.12 --> 965.519
do it

963.6 --> 969.839
not too sure how that worked maybe it

965.519 --> 969.839
was more chemical based

971.12 --> 973.759
vibration

974.72 --> 978.5600000000001
right well vibration can cause

976.639 --> 982.48
electrostatics

978.56 --> 985.92
so it's like rubbing

982.48 --> 985.9200000000001
as a process of flying

987.43 --> 990.55
[Music]

993.12 --> 997.839
hey julio map heaven

1006.32 --> 1014.24
what what

1011.04 --> 1015.8389999999999
oh right jaren did shirts with the nasa

1014.24 --> 1025.839
logos on it and

1015.839 --> 1025.839
got copyrighted yeah

1033.36 --> 1039.839
what the hell

1042.16 --> 1045.3490000000002
[Music]

1046.319 --> 1054.0
dude don't that's

1050.0 --> 1057.039
[ __ ] up yet don't share

1054.0 --> 1067.84
the stories that you didn't want to know

1057.039 --> 1067.84
thanks seth happy

1070.62 --> 1075.51
[Music]

1078.84 --> 1081.84
hmm

1091.44 --> 1095.8400000000001
okay well thanks for that because now i

1093.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
have that image in my head says happy

1095.84 --> 1109.84
thanks a lot

1120.84 --> 1123.84
uh

1126.32 --> 1130.8799999999999
yeah well thanks a lot because you know

1129.2 --> 1133.919
sometimes i don't even need to see the

1130.88 --> 1135.919
footage if somebody describes it to me

1133.919 --> 1138.24
and a certain type of feeling then

1135.919 --> 1139.8400000000001
through the combination of what they're

1138.24 --> 1141.28
saying

1139.84 --> 1143.28
and what they're feeling as they're

1141.28 --> 1151.6789999999999
saying it even through chat i just

1143.28 --> 1156.24
tune in and see it anyway so thanks

1151.679 --> 1156.24
you didn't have to be so descriptive no

1157.2 --> 1161.6000000000001
it's uh yeah i don't want to like

1161.679 --> 1166.5590000000002
pull this out of contortion but it's

1163.36 --> 1169.12
like back in all the internet days it

1166.559 --> 1172.32
wasn't like 2001 or something or was it

1169.12 --> 1174.4799999999998
at a school where they had internet

1172.32 --> 1177.12
and then yeah people just dumped all

1174.48 --> 1179.679
kinds of stuff like on a general server

1177.12 --> 1180.3999999999999
and everybody yeah including games by

1179.679 --> 1182.0800000000002
the way

1180.4 --> 1183.44
but sometimes there was some [ __ ] up

1182.08 --> 1186.72
videos in there

1183.44 --> 1190.4
like like suicide [ __ ] or

1186.72 --> 1192.32
worse and yeah if you stumbled upon that

1190.4 --> 1193.52
you know yeah that that gets to you

1192.32 --> 1195.76
especially to me

1193.52 --> 1197.76
well i'm not gonna say like oh i saw

1195.76 --> 1201.039
this and this and this i saw this

1197.76 --> 1201.84
no because i you i know that's just

1201.039 --> 1204.08
burdening

1201.84 --> 1204.8799999999999
that [ __ ] on somebody else you know if

1204.08 --> 1206.72
you could

1204.88 --> 1209.5200000000002
the best i would say yeah i saw

1206.72 --> 1212.32
something really disgusting

1209.52 --> 1214.48
so just say snuff or something and yeah

1212.32 --> 1218.3999999999999
that's good enough

1214.48 --> 1220.08
so because yeah it's terrible and if you

1218.4 --> 1223.2
share it then you

1220.08 --> 1223.1999999999998
echo the terror

1232.84 --> 1237.84
okay

1235.28 --> 1240.1589999999999
yeah they those videos would get removed

1237.84 --> 1249.84
by the way eventually

1240.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
thank god

1273.679 --> 1280.4
well missouri bear i don't know

1277.12 --> 1283.039
in general i guess you're right but

1280.4 --> 1285.1200000000001
if you realize what the news has become

1283.039 --> 1286.559
right now what's going on what's being

1285.12 --> 1288.8799999999999
attempted

1286.559 --> 1289.76
through the information placement in the

1288.88 --> 1292.64
news

1289.76 --> 1293.039
then you could watch it because if you

1292.64 --> 1296.4
don't

1293.039 --> 1298.96
you're going to be like if you don't

1296.4 --> 1300.64
realize that and you're going to take

1298.96 --> 1301.8400000000001
the full force of it yeah you're going

1300.64 --> 1305.6000000000001
to just be drag

1301.84 --> 1308.799
drug along dragged along into the

1305.6 --> 1313.36
the fierce fireling that's attached to

1308.799 --> 1313.36
the to the entire mechanism presented

1313.679 --> 1318.159
tells you on every step what you're

1316.08 --> 1318.48
supposed to be preoccupying yourself

1318.159 --> 1320.7990000000002
with

1318.48 --> 1320.799
you know

1321.919 --> 1325.679
but if you do realize that then and you

1325.039 --> 1327.84
could

1325.679 --> 1330.0
bear to sit through it then you can

1327.84 --> 1332.48
watch the news

1330.0 --> 1333.52
but i wouldn't like do it constantly

1332.48 --> 1335.3600000000001
because that

1333.52 --> 1336.8799999999999
[ __ ] just keeps on rolling out

1335.36 --> 1339.4399999999998
constantly new stuff

1336.88 --> 1339.44
like they all

1340.64 --> 1343.76
yeah it's not just repeating the same

1342.799 --> 1345.76
people's

1343.76 --> 1346.8799999999999
like the same clip over and over again

1345.76 --> 1350.32
no no this just

1346.88 --> 1354.159
new stuff nonsense

1350.32 --> 1358.84
with news occupational hazard

1354.159 --> 1361.8400000000001
issues and tasks will be rolled out

1358.84 --> 1361.84
constantly

1362.32 --> 1365.6789999999999
but if you want to pulse like where is

1364.48 --> 1368.48
it at right now

1365.679 --> 1368.88
yeah sure you could just open it up

1368.48 --> 1372.84
watch

1368.88 --> 1376.0800000000002
what they're gonna do how bad is it this

1372.84 --> 1379.4399999999998
time i do that too

1376.08 --> 1389.84
with the dutch news when yeah when i can

1379.44 --> 1389.8400000000001
handle it

1392.64 --> 1398.0800000000002
yeah right missouri bear

1396.0 --> 1399.2
yeah and hey even on the news that i

1398.08 --> 1401.36
watched recently

1399.2 --> 1403.28
there's always something really terrible

1401.36 --> 1406.3999999999999
going on

1403.28 --> 1408.96
or it's just like showing

1406.4 --> 1410.4
all the people like oh how terrible do

1408.96 --> 1413.44
you think this is

1410.4 --> 1415.2800000000002
about that person getting killed by that

1413.44 --> 1417.039
cop and like everything's like oh

1415.28 --> 1418.96
everybody wants to hear about what

1417.039 --> 1420.4
everybody else thinks about that cop

1418.96 --> 1422.64
getting killed apparently you know it

1420.4 --> 1425.44
affected their life and

1422.64 --> 1427.679
that especially that is what i got to

1425.44 --> 1427.679
see

1428.559 --> 1434.1589999999999
it like on dutch television it's like oh

1434.32 --> 1445.84
what do you have to say about the

1436.08 --> 1445.84
pre-fab narrative

1456.84 --> 1459.84
okay

1480.159 --> 1486.64
that tiny wombo yeah they

1483.52 --> 1489.6
they nasa uses a pool

1486.64 --> 1491.2
to stimulate weight weightlessness but

1489.6 --> 1493.4399999999998
technically that

1491.2 --> 1494.96
that's not really effective because if

1493.44 --> 1498.0
you think about it

1494.96 --> 1501.279
yeah the thing that you could sort of

1498.0 --> 1502.24
emulate is floating in neutral buoyancy

1501.279 --> 1505.44
by

1502.24 --> 1508.72
making sure that the the

1505.44 --> 1509.2
astronaut whatever in the suit in the

1508.72 --> 1511.76
pool

1509.2 --> 1513.1200000000001
is gonna have a relative density in its

1511.76 --> 1515.679
totality that is

1513.12 --> 1516.559
exactly on average of the the water in

1515.679 --> 1519.039
the pool

1516.559 --> 1521.36
so they will naturally just stay afloat

1519.039 --> 1524.1589999999999
that could be a thing

1521.36 --> 1524.559
because everything else besides that

1524.159 --> 1528.159
yeah

1524.559 --> 1529.279
water is extremely dense a lot of

1528.159 --> 1532.48
friction

1529.279 --> 1536.48
all that and yeah guess what space is

1532.48 --> 1539.039
exactly the opposite it's it's like

1536.48 --> 1539.76
because nothing is stopping anything so

1539.039 --> 1542.96
it's

1539.76 --> 1545.44
it's kind of useless really to simulate

1542.96 --> 1548.4
conditions

1545.44 --> 1548.4
it really is

1548.96 --> 1553.3600000000001
it's only for the the neutral boys the

1551.2 --> 1553.76
the floating thing that's the only thing

1553.36 --> 1556.24
that

1553.76 --> 1556.8799999999999
could really be functional for my

1556.24 --> 1560.64
opinion

1556.88 --> 1571.0390000000002
as a simulation if you would presuppose

1560.64 --> 1574.0800000000002
that that's actually why they do that

1571.039 --> 1576.08
no but tiny one will see that's exactly

1574.08 --> 1579.1999999999998
where you're wrong

1576.08 --> 1580.32
because there is a much more realistic

1579.2 --> 1584.159
more effective

1580.32 --> 1586.08
simulation and that is

1584.159 --> 1587.6000000000001
through the vomit comet through the

1586.08 --> 1590.24
plane so what do you do

1587.6 --> 1591.9189999999999
you put an astronaut in a suit right in

1590.24 --> 1594.08
an astronaut suit

1591.919 --> 1596.48
then you put them in that plane they

1594.08 --> 1597.039
dive then they get to experience what it

1596.48 --> 1599.84
is like

1597.039 --> 1601.52
in that suit or at least in something

1599.84 --> 1604.3999999999999
that's not as dense

1601.52 --> 1606.08
as water then you can really test what

1604.4 --> 1609.2
it's like

1606.08 --> 1613.4399999999998
even though it is inside of a of a

1609.2 --> 1615.279
plane right

1613.44 --> 1618.159
that's the closest you're gonna get to

1615.279 --> 1620.24
actual simulation

1618.159 --> 1622.7990000000002
of what it what you're supposed to

1620.24 --> 1622.799
simulate

1624.0 --> 1641.84
it's much more close to

1628.0 --> 1641.84
close to the real thing than water

1645.039 --> 1648.24
yeah and if you want to double down on

1647.679 --> 1651.76
that

1648.24 --> 1654.24
then even yeah do a vomit comet with

1651.76 --> 1657.279
like special uh

1654.24 --> 1658.08
with yes special pressure regulation and

1657.279 --> 1660.32
then

1658.08 --> 1662.48
put them in the suit in the vomit comet

1660.32 --> 1664.96
and then actually take away

1662.48 --> 1667.44
some of the pressure that would have to

1664.96 --> 1668.32
be some very special structural systems

1667.44 --> 1670.159
to

1668.32 --> 1672.24
make that possible without plain

1670.159 --> 1673.8400000000001
imploding

1672.24 --> 1675.44
because it's so it's supposed to be

1673.84 --> 1678.559
pressurized to yeah to keep the

1675.44 --> 1678.559
structural integrity

1679.039 --> 1683.52
good so but yeah do it in a vacuum

1682.559 --> 1687.039
chamber

1683.52 --> 1688.08
sort of or lower pressure inside a vomit

1687.039 --> 1690.559
comet type

1688.08 --> 1693.279
plane or whatever and then you'll get

1690.559 --> 1693.279
very close

1694.24 --> 1699.36
but yeah you know it's

1697.44 --> 1700.64
it's the closest to simulation you're

1699.36 --> 1704.9599999999998
ever going to get because

1700.64 --> 1706.96
i don't think in yeah the training for

1704.96 --> 1708.8400000000001
right yeah it's the only thing it's ever

1706.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
going to be

1708.84 --> 1711.84
because

1713.52 --> 1720.0
yeah it you don't float up there what

1716.799 --> 1720.0
comes up must come down

1720.32 --> 1725.84
it goes up must come down

1730.32 --> 1735.6
what is the fetish with weightlessness

1733.6 --> 1739.84
that's not too difficult robin stanley

1735.6 --> 1739.84
it is the fetal situation

1745.279 --> 1752.88
remember the end of space disease

1748.32 --> 1757.039
2001 the embryo

1752.88 --> 1757.0390000000002
in outer space and yeah

1761.039 --> 1764.8799999999999
so many ways by the way that connects

1762.72 --> 1764.88
but

1765.679 --> 1770.24
yeah weightlessness is associated

1768.159 --> 1775.44
basically

1770.24 --> 1775.44
with with if you know the fetus

1775.6 --> 1783.6789999999999
unborn baby in a womb

1780.32 --> 1783.6789999999999
they float in there

1787.039 --> 1798.789
they're neutrally buoyant

1795.68 --> 1798.789
[Music]

1806.84 --> 1812.1589999999999
yeah that's hilarious missouri bear

1809.84 --> 1814.6399999999999
i did not know i'll have to check that

1812.159 --> 1814.64
with uh

1815.039 --> 1820.08
with quantum eraser i think but

1818.08 --> 1821.279
what i do know is that the ether was

1820.08 --> 1824.24
removed to

1821.279 --> 1825.76
allow the what is it the theory of

1824.24 --> 1829.84
relativity

1825.76 --> 1832.559
to be possible so it was basically just

1829.84 --> 1833.52
put to the side just to make the broken

1832.559 --> 1836.72
calculations

1833.52 --> 1838.8799999999999
work at the time

1836.72 --> 1842.0
so if he brought it back afterward yeah

1838.88 --> 1842.0
i wouldn't be surprised

1845.039 --> 1848.08
although i don't know yeah i don't know

1847.039 --> 1851.84
where you're getting that

1848.08 --> 1851.84
really who told you that

1876.84 --> 1879.84
hmm

1885.44 --> 1889.3600000000001
yeah isn't it funny guns have never

1887.039 --> 1892.0
owned it that tiny womble basically

1889.36 --> 1894.559
completely ignored everything i

1892.0 --> 1898.32
explained about the difference

1894.559 --> 1901.6
but i'm actually taking

1898.32 --> 1905.039
the idea of simulating space more

1901.6 --> 1905.039
seriously than he is

1905.6 --> 1909.76
because he knows that a vomit comet is a

1907.84 --> 1913.039
more effective

1909.76 --> 1913.44
system because it is more like the real

1913.039 --> 1916.64
thing

1913.44 --> 1920.0800000000002
in space you don't have a lot of

1916.64 --> 1922.3990000000001
friction so you you do

1920.08 --> 1924.799
have all this extra maneuver it matters

1922.399 --> 1927.039
a lot if you actually want to practice

1924.799 --> 1927.039
that

1932.84 --> 1936.72
right

1934.24 --> 1937.679
hey and if you don't have a lot of time

1936.72 --> 1939.279
for that

1937.679 --> 1941.039
doesn't mean that's impossible it just

1939.279 --> 1944.799
means you do it one

1941.039 --> 1947.279
part at a time there's going to be more

1944.799 --> 1948.72
friction on the person because their

1947.279 --> 1950.72
stomach is going to get more of a

1948.72 --> 1953.279
pounding because yeah weightlessness is

1950.72 --> 1956.159
like for is literally falling

1953.279 --> 1957.12
and then suddenly not falling or rising

1956.159 --> 1960.48
and then again

1957.12 --> 1960.4799999999998
yeah that's pretty stressful

1961.36 --> 1966.399
you know when you're in a spacesuit

1963.84 --> 1969.76
suppose pre-supposedly in outer space

1966.399 --> 1971.039
outside of a spaceship you don't have

1969.76 --> 1974.8799999999999
time to let

1971.039 --> 1977.919
oh yeah let's just be comfortable floaty

1974.88 --> 1979.519
no way there's no way

1977.919 --> 1981.919
like you're constantly feeling like

1979.519 --> 1984.799
you're falling how can you

1981.919 --> 1985.279
just relax it's like your mind is gonna

1984.799 --> 1988.399
be

1985.279 --> 1991.279
warped because you you feel like

1988.399 --> 1993.36
you're falling and everything is

1991.279 --> 1995.519
apparently falling with you because

1993.36 --> 1997.519
it remains at the same height so it's

1995.519 --> 2000.0
going to be very confusing for your

1997.519 --> 2002.559
instinct

2000.0 --> 2003.279
so it's good actually to have that extra

2002.559 --> 2004.96
stress

2003.279 --> 2007.519
during such training because it'll be

2004.96 --> 2011.519
much closer to reality

2007.519 --> 2013.6
you know and this is also one of the

2011.519 --> 2014.48
things about the whole idea and the

2013.6 --> 2017.36
legend of

2014.48 --> 2020.0
astronauts is that yeah the astronauts

2017.36 --> 2022.1589999999999
that can handle that

2020.0 --> 2024.24
are the real ones because if you get

2022.159 --> 2026.24
sick from falling a lot

2024.24 --> 2028.32
then you're not going to be an astronaut

2026.24 --> 2031.039
well really can you really get used to

2028.32 --> 2033.9189999999999
that for prolonged periods

2031.039 --> 2035.76
can you get used to the sensation of

2033.919 --> 2038.96
falling

2035.76 --> 2042.72
for periods of a year

2038.96 --> 2045.039
months really can you

2042.72 --> 2046.88
i know there's a lot of theorizing and

2045.039 --> 2048.72
talk about it and precip

2046.88 --> 2050.079
like that's already going on it's very

2048.72 --> 2053.1189999999997
interesting but

2050.079 --> 2053.44
is that really possible can you really

2053.119 --> 2059.28
get

2053.44 --> 2062.079
used to being in a state of falling

2059.28 --> 2063.0400000000004
for a very long time can your body even

2062.079 --> 2066.2400000000002
get used to that

2063.04 --> 2069.119
i know it's presupposed

2066.24 --> 2071.5989999999997
but is it actually possible this is how

2069.119 --> 2089.839
do you even test that in reality

2071.599 --> 2089.839
you know i don't think you can

2090.8 --> 2096.639
really really sad tappy you can really

2093.76 --> 2101.119
get used to the sensation of falling

2096.639 --> 2104.48
without feeling friction really you can

2101.119 --> 2106.2400000000002
really so what if i'd say that that

2104.48 --> 2109.96
experience is much more

2106.24 --> 2112.56
the sensation like you're eternally

2109.96 --> 2113.28
accelerating without anything to stop

2112.56 --> 2115.119
you

2113.28 --> 2116.8
how about when it feels like that is

2115.119 --> 2117.6800000000003
that something you can get used to

2116.8 --> 2121.8390000000004
anytime soon

2117.68 --> 2121.839
said tappy are you sure about that

2123.76 --> 2130.32
falling without anything to stop you

2126.88 --> 2132.56
forever you think you can get used to

2130.32 --> 2132.56
that

2138.4 --> 2142.48
you don't know what i know i've

2140.64 --> 2145.839
experienced a lot of things

2142.48 --> 2145.839
surreal things

2151.04 --> 2154.56
vertical looping model hey kamikaze

2153.76 --> 2157.44
gilmore i

2154.56 --> 2158.0789999999997
have already presupposed that that hey

2157.44 --> 2159.839
if you're

2158.079 --> 2161.119
it's a it's a couple of present

2159.839 --> 2164.0
positions

2161.119 --> 2165.28
so if the equator line happens to be

2164.0 --> 2169.28
straight

2165.28 --> 2171.119
on a flat surface then it's very likely

2169.28 --> 2172.6400000000003
that there is a loop within the realms

2171.119 --> 2176.1600000000003
confines so if there is

2172.64 --> 2178.16
a loop in the realms confine somehow

2176.16 --> 2179.68
then there is a possibility that there

2178.16 --> 2182.24
is a loop

2179.68 --> 2183.2
in the realm in another fashion say

2182.24 --> 2186.3999999999996
north-south

2183.2 --> 2189.52
somehow maybe not but

2186.4 --> 2189.52
maybe there is a loop

2190.24 --> 2196.8799999999997
north or yeah up to down somehow

2194.96 --> 2198.079
you know i don't know how it would work

2196.88 --> 2200.88
maybe you can't go

2198.079 --> 2202.6400000000003
up but maybe you can go down maybe this

2200.88 --> 2204.88
energy barrier that is

2202.64 --> 2206.0
now sort of presumed by me to be there

2204.88 --> 2208.079
right

2206.0 --> 2209.44
which isn't the final container it's

2208.079 --> 2212.1600000000003
just a barrier

2209.44 --> 2214.0
set in between the actual container

2212.16 --> 2217.7599999999998
maybe you can't get out

2214.0 --> 2222.0
but maybe you can fall through it

2217.76 --> 2225.119
so yeah what if there was a

2222.0 --> 2226.16
loop up to down and there would be

2225.119 --> 2230.48
somehow a

2226.16 --> 2232.72
a good way a hole in the earth

2230.48 --> 2234.0
a tunnel like the idea of an eternal

2232.72 --> 2238.16
tunnel and yeah

2234.0 --> 2241.119
what if that was somehow

2238.16 --> 2243.839
found or achieved or whatever yeah you

2241.119 --> 2243.839
could have a

2245.24 --> 2250.56
[Music]

2248.32 --> 2252.7200000000003
yeah and if you want to get really crazy

2250.56 --> 2253.44
then you're gonna build a perpetual

2252.72 --> 2258.16
vacuum

2253.44 --> 2260.8
tube in that like a interconnecting tube

2258.16 --> 2261.92
a like a singular tube then draw a

2260.8 --> 2264.079
vacuum in it

2261.92 --> 2267.6800000000003
and then drop something in that and then

2264.079 --> 2267.6800000000003
it won't have any friction what's gonna

2268.839 --> 2271.839
happen

2276.4 --> 2284.0
hey we are talking conceptions aren't we

2280.4 --> 2286.88
what you think this is all god some

2284.0 --> 2286.88
people really

2288.72 --> 2291.839
come on tiny wumbo

2293.52 --> 2300.079
it's called science fiction okay

2296.839 --> 2302.48
it's it's an extremely

2300.079 --> 2304.8
remote possibility based on several

2302.48 --> 2307.04
steps of presuppositions

2304.8 --> 2308.0
doesn't mean it's impossible though

2307.04 --> 2310.8
because

2308.0 --> 2311.2
none of these elements have definitively

2310.8 --> 2315.3590000000004
been

2311.2 --> 2320.16
disproven unlike some other conceptions

2315.359 --> 2320.16
that break natural law for example or

2321.76 --> 2330.6400000000003
unproven r values or misconstrue the

2325.76 --> 2332.96
actual workings of optics you know

2330.64 --> 2336.0
because the things that i mentioned are

2332.96 --> 2340.079
not entirely disproven

2336.0 --> 2342.0
there like it remains a potential not

2340.079 --> 2344.1600000000003
that it's relevant to anything

2342.0 --> 2345.839
at this point but it remains a potential

2344.16 --> 2346.96
there's nothing that is just gonna

2345.839 --> 2354.0789999999997
outright say

2346.96 --> 2356.32
no absolutely impossible

2354.079 --> 2357.92
because i don't know is it breaking

2356.32 --> 2360.8
natural law is there anything about my

2357.92 --> 2364.16
conception that breaks natural law

2360.8 --> 2366.2400000000002
is the loop within us

2364.16 --> 2368.48
within a spatial confine is that

2366.24 --> 2373.52
breaking of natural law

2368.48 --> 2373.52
somehow i don't think so

2380.8 --> 2384.48
continually falling like a roller

2382.8 --> 2387.52
coaster yeah goody if

2384.48 --> 2390.32
that's what you want to use it for

2387.52 --> 2390.32
it's just the

2390.96 --> 2397.839
the the terra roller coaster

2398.4 --> 2401.76
some crazy [ __ ] no but who knows you

2400.8 --> 2404.1600000000003
know look

2401.76 --> 2405.5200000000004
if at some if like say now we're gonna

2404.16 --> 2408.24
get into such

2405.52 --> 2408.56
ultra high tech futurist [ __ ] that's

2408.24 --> 2410.9599999999996
just

2408.56 --> 2412.56
insane but yeah but if there was a hole

2410.96 --> 2414.64
through it through the loop

2412.56 --> 2416.16
then eventually it could be used as a

2414.64 --> 2419.359
giant transporting

2416.16 --> 2420.72
lift for the entire realm whatever is

2419.359 --> 2423.44
built

2420.72 --> 2424.0
like even in the several layers of the

2423.44 --> 2425.92
earth

2424.0 --> 2427.44
it could just be this interconnecting

2425.92 --> 2430.4
tube then

2427.44 --> 2430.4
of the yeah

2430.64 --> 2434.319
it does sound kind of like babylonic

2433.599 --> 2437.599
really

2434.319 --> 2438.88
it would effectively be a super

2437.599 --> 2442.319
high-tech babylon

2438.88 --> 2443.6800000000003
tube that penetrates the heaven until

2442.319 --> 2446.8
the bottom and becomes

2443.68 --> 2448.72
like the snake biting its own tail and

2446.8 --> 2452.4
the symbolism is outrageous

2448.72 --> 2454.64
i know but science fiction

2452.4 --> 2454.64
so

2457.96 --> 2467.839
[Music]

2460.64 --> 2467.839
oh no caps don't do that

2478.839 --> 2483.599
hmm

2480.24 --> 2487.9199999999996
no john john mack the spherical math

2483.599 --> 2489.52
does not work at best we've disproven

2487.92 --> 2492.839
the r value

2489.52 --> 2495.04
so the mathematical consequences of that

2492.839 --> 2498.0789999999997
are

2495.04 --> 2501.2
universe warping so

2498.079 --> 2504.4
no circle math doesn't really work out

2501.2 --> 2507.3999999999996
besides the whole spherical math

2504.4 --> 2509.839
connection to the supposed reality is a

2507.4 --> 2512.4
misconstruency is a

2509.839 --> 2513.92
a misunderstanding on purpose of how

2512.4 --> 2518.0
optics works

2513.92 --> 2521.44
so i wouldn't recommend it

2518.0 --> 2523.359
concave it's not looking good for these

2521.44 --> 2526.88
guys

2523.359 --> 2529.839
you know and that's why

2526.88 --> 2531.359
we don't hear a lot about it because

2529.839 --> 2532.96
there's not a lot of development because

2531.359 --> 2533.7599999999998
they can't because they're stuck in

2532.96 --> 2535.839
errors

2533.76 --> 2537.44
that they have to reinforce because it's

2535.839 --> 2542.16
become the foundation of

2537.44 --> 2546.64
their corner of how they view the world

2542.16 --> 2546.64
they they let the globe sneak in there

2547.119 --> 2551.839
and when you do that you got to bear the

2548.839 --> 2551.839
consequences

2571.92 --> 2580.7200000000003
yeah doing great here

2575.76 --> 2580.7200000000003
i'm in the iss currently

2584.319 --> 2593.839
very confident and have to make sure

2587.76 --> 2593.8390000000004
my pendulum doesn't float away

2605.28 --> 2610.6400000000003
and i made sure i put my hair in a tail

2608.64 --> 2612.7999999999997
with a knot because otherwise you know

2610.64 --> 2615.7599999999998
what happens

2612.8 --> 2615.76
don't want to do that

2618.16 --> 2621.839
see who needs freaking wires

2623.92 --> 2635.839
i can do it in my freaking room

2636.4 --> 2640.1600000000003
see all i have to do is wear a white

2640.96 --> 2644.369
[Music]

2646.839 --> 2650.16
shirt

2648.67 --> 2653.599
[Music]

2650.16 --> 2663.839
uh your ponytail should be up

2653.599 --> 2667.76
i don't really like it like that anymore

2663.839 --> 2667.7599999999998
must be the space shorts

2668.16 --> 2677.839
oh thank you for that thanks

2677.92 --> 2691.839
i needed that

2703.92 --> 2707.839
yeah george sanford yeah maybe or you

2706.16 --> 2719.839
gotta be bald

2707.839 --> 2719.839
ball seems to be popular too

2725.839 --> 2737.119
hey man

2733.68 --> 2738.0789999999997
somersaults yeah the somersault thing

2737.119 --> 2740.2400000000002
that is where

2738.079 --> 2742.48
they really start to use the wires in my

2740.24 --> 2746.72
opinion

2742.48 --> 2750.0
you know because i

2746.72 --> 2753.5989999999997
i can't just simulate this summer

2750.0 --> 2753.599
soldier and that's where you need the

2758.839 --> 2761.839
wires

2772.079 --> 2778.88
i you know what i'm wondering is if if

2775.44 --> 2782.2400000000002
is if they're ever gonna resort to using

2778.88 --> 2784.1600000000003
magnetic boots maybe that was too much

2782.24 --> 2786.8799999999997
of a hassle when they tried i bet they

2784.16 --> 2786.8799999999997
have tried it

2787.119 --> 2791.07
remember because of the science fiction

2788.8 --> 2794.1490000000003
movies magnetic boots

2791.07 --> 2794.1490000000003
[Music]

2794.56 --> 2799.04
and then yeah you could potentially if

2797.04 --> 2801.68
it's like really good magnets

2799.04 --> 2803.119
then do it upside down like what are you

2801.68 --> 2806.56
talking about

2803.119 --> 2809.44
gravity like yeah you just act

2806.56 --> 2810.24
like it's not and use the magnetic boots

2809.44 --> 2814.839
to basically

2810.24 --> 2817.1189999999997
don't drop down you know can be a little

2814.839 --> 2819.68
tricky

2817.119 --> 2819.6800000000003
i don't know

2821.839 --> 2824.96
maybe i already tried something like

2823.44 --> 2828.839
this i

2824.96 --> 2845.839
i don't keep track of the latest video

2828.839 --> 2845.839
outputs and projects of what nasa does

2856.839 --> 2859.839
uh

2885.44 --> 2889.2000000000003
well guns have never run rmp

2889.599 --> 2897.119
i don't know man it is a big joke

2893.68 --> 2900.0789999999997
technically you're correct but

2897.119 --> 2902.88
it just seems like there's just not a

2900.079 --> 2905.599
lot of new updates and stuff

2902.88 --> 2909.2000000000003
it's almost like there's just not enough

2905.599 --> 2912.0
people to figure it out for them

2909.2 --> 2912.319
how to update tricks and new things to

2912.0 --> 2916.8
do

2912.319 --> 2916.8
in show i think maybe

2926.839 --> 2929.839
what

2940.4 --> 2946.48
yeah oh god really

2944.16 --> 2948.0
well don't let lemon bird hear that one

2946.48 --> 2952.2400000000002
missouri bear

2948.0 --> 2955.359
never hear the end of it [ __ ]

2952.24 --> 2958.3999999999996
that's exactly what he always says

2955.359 --> 2960.4
like the vacuum what the medium there it

2958.4 --> 2961.52
must be ether it's filled with ether and

2960.4 --> 2971.839
this is

2961.52 --> 2971.839
oh dear god

2980.559 --> 2985.8390000000004
all right see around tiny wumble

3008.8 --> 3014.079
hmm fake space junk

3014.4 --> 3023.04
that's it's weird isn't it because

3018.48 --> 3025.92
and tragic originally how

3023.04 --> 3027.52
like the supposed special projects and

3025.92 --> 3029.359
everything came together was by

3027.52 --> 3032.16
basically

3029.359 --> 3034.24
used utilizing manufacturers all over

3032.16 --> 3034.8799999999997
the country to just every let everybody

3034.24 --> 3036.8799999999997
produce

3034.88 --> 3038.839
a thing based on the industry they

3036.88 --> 3041.04
already had

3038.839 --> 3044.16
right but yeah

3041.04 --> 3046.16
if it's no longer done like that people

3044.16 --> 3049.52
are no longer directly involved

3046.16 --> 3051.68
as much like that like not

3049.52 --> 3053.359
in the know it's fake with this very

3051.68 --> 3055.5989999999997
construction yeah

3053.359 --> 3057.92
then you could just have separate

3055.599 --> 3060.8
companies that are in the know it's fake

3057.92 --> 3062.7200000000003
just build cheap as cheap but good

3060.8 --> 3065.6800000000003
looking props as possible

3062.72 --> 3067.68
then you get into that type of situation

3065.68 --> 3069.839
so i wouldn't be surprised if there are

3067.68 --> 3073.04
companies dedicated

3069.839 --> 3076.24
to build to building that kind of junk

3073.04 --> 3078.319
and it is actually junk then because

3076.24 --> 3083.839
it's on these four looks

3078.319 --> 3083.839
basically trickery

3098.48 --> 3100.72
hmm

3102.88 --> 3108.96
really robin stanley i don't know

3106.079 --> 3110.0
maybe to me that's not heartbreaking to

3108.96 --> 3114.16
hear that it's rather

3110.0 --> 3114.16
like wow that person has a big challenge

3114.4 --> 3117.92
because it's a challenge you know

3121.04 --> 3125.839
i was that guy saying that a lot

3153.04 --> 3155.2799999999997
oh

3156.16 --> 3167.839
i hope that wasn't something really

3157.76 --> 3167.8390000000004
heavy good servant

3168.48 --> 3173.599
a more colored you made it for the last

3171.04 --> 3173.599
few minutes

3178.839 --> 3183.839
oh

3181.28 --> 3184.3190000000004
oh [ __ ] dude get some cold water on

3183.839 --> 3186.5589999999997
there

3184.319 --> 3186.5589999999997
quick

3191.04 --> 3197.7599999999998
yeah just make sure

3194.96 --> 3200.559
it's not like bleeding and then get cold

3197.76 --> 3200.559
water on there

3201.2 --> 3206.64
and that'll hurt that's gonna hurt

3204.24 --> 3207.52
but it'll be better i think unless it's

3206.64 --> 3209.52
like really

3207.52 --> 3211.44
and unless it's like bone damage and

3209.52 --> 3213.04
[ __ ] be careful

3211.44 --> 3223.839
i might want to get a doctor if that's

3213.04 --> 3223.839
the case

3229.119 --> 3233.28
all right if it just hurts if there's no

3231.52 --> 3235.119
bleeding or serious

3233.28 --> 3236.48
bone fracture or something that you can

3235.119 --> 3239.44
detect then

3236.48 --> 3239.44
just cold water

3239.92 --> 3251.839
and just take it easy

3254.72 --> 3260.319
hmm okay mark collard

3257.92 --> 3262.2400000000002
my mornings are brutal lately hope

3260.319 --> 3263.52
really hoping this state opens up

3262.24 --> 3266.0
quickly i'm sick of

3263.52 --> 3266.96
six feet apart right yeah the stooping

3266.0 --> 3269.04
waiting rose

3266.96 --> 3271.44
is getting on my nerves too it's not

3269.04 --> 3273.7599999999998
extremely bad over here

3271.44 --> 3275.119
but it's bad enough that you can't

3273.76 --> 3278.1600000000003
really get away from it

3275.119 --> 3281.599
it's like this place does

3278.16 --> 3282.319
not freaking need a line it's absolutely

3281.599 --> 3285.839
absurd

3282.319 --> 3288.079
that like supermarkets specifically are

3285.839 --> 3290.0789999999997
supermarkets so you don't have these

3288.079 --> 3291.52
freaking lines that's the whole point of

3290.079 --> 3294.7200000000003
them

3291.52 --> 3298.72
like that is

3294.72 --> 3302.48
really aggravating to me realizing that

3298.72 --> 3304.64
and other than that it's yeah

3302.48 --> 3305.52
everybody's getting really tired of it

3304.64 --> 3308.64
and everybody's

3305.52 --> 3309.44
looking it's resounding everywhere that

3308.64 --> 3311.2799999999997
like yeah

3309.44 --> 3313.76
so many people saying this is nonsense

3311.28 --> 3316.4
and stats don't work out these people

3313.76 --> 3319.2000000000003
are liars it's

3316.4 --> 3321.839
money interests playing around with

3319.2 --> 3321.839
media
