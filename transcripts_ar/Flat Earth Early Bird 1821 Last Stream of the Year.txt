403.68 --> 407.919
that is Richard

405.319 --> 410.68
G just going to have to pay closer

407.919 --> 413.31899999999996
attention somebody's just screwing

410.68 --> 413.319
around with

417.24 --> 423.40000000000003
YouTube I don't know man maybe they

419.759 --> 425.879
think they're like a secret service or

423.4 --> 428.44
something whatever it is it's just

425.879 --> 428.44
mostly

446.0 --> 451.319
annoying all

448.319 --> 451.319
right

460.68 --> 462.919
right

469.96 --> 478.31899999999996
anyhow still need to be waking up a bit

475.12 --> 480.52
more I got a coffee at the

478.319 --> 483.759
standby

480.52 --> 488.88
we're not taking that right

483.759 --> 491.949
away uh course got an Illuminati saw

488.88 --> 491.949
[Music]

493.56 --> 498.56
here what am I going to talk about

502.12 --> 508.24
uh right so yesterday somebody like made

506.28 --> 510.039
a

508.24 --> 512.8
comment

510.039 --> 516.24
neuro Jack like I that's the guy I know

512.8 --> 519.3199999999999
from Jim Bob I

516.24 --> 522.279
think right there's no issue there but

519.32 --> 525.08
you left this com like hey there's this

522.279 --> 528.08
stream in like

525.08 --> 530.8000000000001
hours you got to check it out it's like

528.08 --> 535.64
the machine lives channel so I did check

530.8 --> 535.64
that out but it was very very

535.72 --> 541.2
late

538.2 --> 541.2
and

541.8 --> 547.4799999999999
it was kind of Especial at the start was

545.0 --> 549.839
just goofy I don't know it wasn't really

547.48 --> 552.279
my thing I'm sorry it's just it felt

549.839 --> 556.519
like what is this some kind of

552.279 --> 560.48
a shaara wannabe

556.519 --> 564.0
thing playing Revolution oh Revolution

560.48 --> 564.839
speech and it was all just really black

564.0 --> 568.48
or

564.839 --> 570.519
whatever I don't know but later like

568.48 --> 571.5600000000001
conversation and some that other guys

570.519 --> 576.0
got on

571.56 --> 578.4399999999999
there and they had a pretty decently

576.0 --> 580.8
interesting

578.44 --> 582.8000000000001
conversation it became kind of messy

580.8 --> 586.56
eventually

582.8 --> 586.56
but this guy

588.839 --> 595.32
uh flight Earth Israelite or something

592.16 --> 597.959
like that not entirely I don't remember

595.32 --> 601.5600000000001
exactly but he just had a lot of

597.959 --> 605.1999999999999
research they were talking about

601.56 --> 607.8
religion but they were taking it pretty

605.2 --> 610.6400000000001
far so it was just an in that moment I

607.8 --> 614.16
was like I wish that Adam mein was

610.64 --> 616.4399999999999
here with me in the chat or something

614.16 --> 620.4399999999999
was in the middle of the night though

616.44 --> 620.44
so so that was kind of

620.56 --> 625.92
interesting parts of

622.6 --> 631.0400000000001
it reading something in

625.92 --> 631.04
Wikipedia and you found something okay

643.07 --> 648.9200000000001
[Music]

645.04 --> 648.92
okay that's cute

658.04 --> 661.04
Looper

662.279 --> 667.8
Brian from Brian's logic also posted

665.56 --> 670.959
kind of an interesting video that he

667.8 --> 670.959
stumbled upon on

671.68 --> 677.279
YouTube where it's basically a very

674.519 --> 679.399
elaborate explanation about gravity with

677.279 --> 682.639
animations and all

679.399 --> 686.24
that I have to say like it is one of the

682.639 --> 690.9590000000001
better videos just dryly trying to

686.24 --> 690.9590000000001
explain it that I've seen

693.24 --> 699.32
but I mean it is it is all ballart mess

696.959 --> 704.4399999999999
though it's just like yeah if you

699.32 --> 704.44
explain it like that it it you can be

706.2 --> 712.6
convinced it is very compelling in a way

709.24 --> 717.92
but I mean there is really no evidence

712.6 --> 717.9200000000001
this thing can definitely be reviewed by

717.959 --> 722.88
Nathan

720.519 --> 725.6
right and we would be able to point out

722.88 --> 727.4399999999999
like yeah this is all very cute but

725.6 --> 729.8000000000001
that's not evidence oh you saw a light

727.44 --> 733.2
in the sky oh you drew a conclusion oh

729.8 --> 733.1999999999999
yes yeah that's not scientific

733.44 --> 738.1600000000001
evidence but there's a lot of that in

735.76 --> 738.16
here

738.68 --> 746.519
so and Mathematics just reification and

742.24 --> 746.519
everything but it's still an interesting

747.88 --> 750.88
video

755.04 --> 757.8389999999999
what what's going

773.199 --> 778.04
on usually this time I feel year I feel

776.32 --> 781.32
that yeah Richard G you know what that

778.04 --> 785.3199999999999
is because I've been actively like

781.32 --> 785.32
applying the technique to all of you

786.16 --> 791.6
guys I don't even understand why it's

789.72 --> 794.0
it's like yeah I'm just doing it it just

791.6 --> 794.0
feels

795.279 --> 801.279
like I'm Luke Skywalker and I'm like

798.56 --> 803.8389999999999
yeah I'm I'm just lifting my fighter out

801.279 --> 806.199
of the swamp like I don't understand how

803.839 --> 807.7600000000001
this is even possible I'm just doing it

806.199 --> 812.7199999999999
I'm not trying and failing I'm just

807.76 --> 812.72
doing it and it's having an

817.04 --> 822.639
influence and I'm especially like more

820.639 --> 828.24
specifically targeting people that have

822.639 --> 828.24
had like painful social

828.519 --> 833.279
losses cuz I want to like I want you all

831.519 --> 837.32
to enjoy this

833.279 --> 841.24
power that I

837.32 --> 841.24
discovered a power from

844.639 --> 852.639
God and since this is such a Restless

849.36 --> 856.9590000000001
time my ability in doing it works better

852.639 --> 859.24
it is working better than average and

856.959 --> 861.56
all of you will need it more because

859.24 --> 865.32
everybody's kind of unstable in a

861.56 --> 865.3199999999999
way so I'm doing

867.16 --> 875.079
that and I'm kind of assuming it is

869.959 --> 875.079
working because it works on

878.72 --> 885.839
me yay happy New Year for another 10

883.199 --> 885.8389999999999
hours of

888.9 --> 892.09
[Music]

894.39 --> 897.58
[Music]

897.68 --> 900.68
this

901.519 --> 906.079
maybe I should like show on screen the

903.72 --> 910.8000000000001
newsletter that I got from the county

906.079 --> 910.8
about how explosive fireworks is really

913.839 --> 920.639
illegal just

915.8 --> 920.639
funny like nobody gives a [ __ ] out

923.759 --> 930.6
there yeah derer don't remind people

926.68 --> 930.5999999999999
about that you'll give them ideas again

931.959 --> 936.8
don't bring up the

933.8 --> 936.8
shovel

938.199 --> 941.199
dummy

946.399 --> 951.839
anyway right so yeah I hope I'm you're

948.839 --> 951.839
feeling it Richie

951.88 --> 956.24
G did I miss a message here

957.6 --> 960.6
somewhere

967.319 --> 972.079
oh we got the flu I see it yeah I did

969.199 --> 972.079
miss the message

974.839 --> 979.0790000000001
yes well I'm a little bit sniffy myself

978.199 --> 983.079
but I

979.079 --> 984.959
mean yeah that happens kind of up and

983.079 --> 989.0
down throughout the year even during the

984.959 --> 992.4799999999999
summer so screw that I'm taking it as

989.0 --> 992.48
like a side effect of being a

992.56 --> 999.4799999999999
smoker and it's still yeah could be a

995.199 --> 1002.279
lot worse I I never even like lose my my

999.48 --> 1006.839
taste or my smell like

1002.279 --> 1009.8
ever that used to happen like 10 years

1006.839 --> 1011.48
ago now I just get a bit sniffy and

1009.8 --> 1014.639
that's

1011.48 --> 1014.639
it all

1017.48 --> 1020.48
right

1047.4 --> 1051.5590000000002
what

1050.0 --> 1055.64
okay

1051.559 --> 1059.12
kumu somebody weighing a vacuum chamber

1055.64 --> 1062.919
with normal pressure under a vacuum

1059.12 --> 1065.52
what what is it sounds interesting I

1062.919 --> 1068.679
guess in relation to the subject that

1065.52 --> 1071.36
I've been bringing to the

1068.679 --> 1072.52
table yeah exactly seeking star water

1071.36 --> 1076.0
hello by the

1072.52 --> 1078.6
way Define a vacuum

1076.0 --> 1080.72
chamber I guess it's like a chamber that

1078.6 --> 1082.9599999999998
can be made to draw a vacuum in it but

1080.72 --> 1082.96
then

1083.159 --> 1086.159
isn't

1087.799 --> 1093.76
whatever tobacco makes flu symptoms not

1090.6 --> 1096.76
as bad oh is that

1093.76 --> 1096.76
true

1098.08 --> 1104.9189999999999
H I never thought of it like that

1100.919 --> 1104.919
skeptic interesting that you say

1107.32 --> 1110.32
that

1114.919 --> 1121.4
oh okay so you AUM you mean a lower

1117.64 --> 1125.3600000000001
pressure chamber then not a vacuum it's

1121.4 --> 1125.3600000000001
not a vacuum it's just lower

1136.039 --> 1143.919
pressure proving a lot of nothing

1140.039 --> 1146.2
you're in a smart tonged mood today sing

1143.919 --> 1146.2
star

1154.64 --> 1160.76
water lower pressure is no not like that

1159.039 --> 1164.12
how dare

1160.76 --> 1167.24
you now vacuum is more than just lower

1164.12 --> 1170.2399999999998
pressure vacuum is a lot

1167.24 --> 1170.24
lower

1176.52 --> 1182.1589999999999
11 yeah okay well you're just talking

1178.919 --> 1182.159
colloquio vacuum

1188.96 --> 1194.64
then

1191.559 --> 1199.559
what atoms gave

1194.64 --> 1202.6000000000001
vacuum what what does that mean duper

1199.559 --> 1202.6
that's not a coherent

1208.0 --> 1213.24
sentence your Dyson is a vacuum

1224.4 --> 1230.159
right atoms have vacuum no no they don't

1235.799 --> 1240.08
right technically a vacuum

1240.159 --> 1245.7990000000002
is specified as to an available

1244.24 --> 1249.159
volume

1245.799 --> 1255.2
for atoms to

1249.159 --> 1258.2
enter if a spa if a vacuum space is too

1255.2 --> 1260.159
small for a molecule to enter Then it

1258.2 --> 1264.1200000000001
technically doesn't count as a vacuum

1260.159 --> 1266.4
because it doesn't have the influence on

1264.12 --> 1266.3999999999999
the

1268.919 --> 1273.0800000000002
atoms it's just considered

1281.559 --> 1287.039
closed is differ yes of yeah on the

1284.52 --> 1290.039
atomic scale itself yes

1287.039 --> 1290.039
duper

1291.96 --> 1297.799
right what is a

1293.48 --> 1301.52
vacuum a space that is available for

1297.799 --> 1301.52
material to move

1301.72 --> 1305.32
into especially

1313.0 --> 1320.039
gas hey

1315.279 --> 1320.039
Tomo good to see you

1325.559 --> 1329.32
I'm going to start eating my Illuminati

1327.6 --> 1330.52
I'm getting really hungry from all this

1329.32 --> 1333.0
vacuum

1330.52 --> 1334.9189999999999
talk my stomach's starting to feel like

1333.0 --> 1337.64
a vacuum so I'm going to take a bite out

1334.919 --> 1341.159
of this still nice and warm

1337.64 --> 1346.3600000000001
cheers L of Illuminati cassant of the

1341.159 --> 1346.3600000000001
year nobody cares but I am

1346.96 --> 1349.96
hungry

1376.96 --> 1379.96
for

1398.96 --> 1403.72
I am going to turn on my coffee though I

1401.159 --> 1406.88
want it I want

1403.72 --> 1409.88
sit be right

1406.88 --> 1409.88
back

1436.88 --> 1439.88
for

1449.0 --> 1455.64
oh by the way my rosemary plant is still

1456.52 --> 1461.32
blossoming I think this plant is like an

1458.84 --> 1465.24
all year round blossoming like once it

1461.32 --> 1465.24
started it's just never

1466.799 --> 1474.48
stopped

1469.32 --> 1477.72
oh best K of my life in canab ut

1474.48 --> 1477.72
Utah okay

1480.08 --> 1483.08
cool

1488.12 --> 1493.559
what a fry pan next to your head

1495.12 --> 1500.08
what she going to slap the snot out out

1497.88 --> 1500.0800000000002
of

1501.6 --> 1505.36
you what's going on

1512.64 --> 1515.64
skeptic

1526.679 --> 1529.679
what

1539.039 --> 1545.48
trying to make one what a what AA

1545.96 --> 1549.679
virus a vacuum

1551.76 --> 1556.84
cleaner or an

1554.84 --> 1559.6789999999999
illuminatio what are you going to try to

1556.84 --> 1559.6789999999999
make

1560.72 --> 1564.24
the vacuum chamber oh

1564.64 --> 1570.24
okay I don't

1566.6 --> 1573.0
know it kind of sucks I

1570.24 --> 1575.64
think making a vacuum chamber sounds

1573.0 --> 1575.64
like it would

1586.6 --> 1589.6
suck

1600.97 --> 1604.279
[Music]

1609.24 --> 1613.799
right but what do you want to achieve

1610.64 --> 1613.7990000000002
with doing that AUM

1614.0 --> 1619.6
virus you want to make videos with it or

1616.84 --> 1619.6
something

1623.559 --> 1627.44
demonstrating like the things that I've

1625.399 --> 1629.799
been talking about or demonstrating

1627.44 --> 1629.799
against

1630.2 --> 1636.6000000000001
it yeah airtight is extremely difficult

1633.32 --> 1638.76
to well with a vacuum chamber the best

1636.6 --> 1641.6399999999999
you can like expect

1638.76 --> 1645.8799999999999
is that you

1641.64 --> 1648.0
get it at a pretty decent vacuum level

1645.88 --> 1650.48
and but you always like have to continue

1648.0 --> 1652.88
pumping to keep it like that soon as you

1650.48 --> 1656.08
turn the pump off it's going to like

1652.88 --> 1656.0800000000002
just leak back

1662.36 --> 1667.6789999999999
in different tests with pressures

1672.279 --> 1678.679
okay I like one thing that I'd be

1674.919 --> 1680.48
interested in observing is like

1678.679 --> 1684.279
why do what happen like when you put a

1680.48 --> 1684.279
piece of ice in a

1684.84 --> 1693.8799999999999
vacuum like is it going

1688.679 --> 1697.48
to like is it sublimate evaporate

1693.88 --> 1697.48
directly like is that

1700.559 --> 1706.799
visible or will it actually stay in

1703.76 --> 1709.08
form I mean yeah that that's the type of

1706.799 --> 1711.279
question that I'm curious about I've

1709.08 --> 1714.48
never really bumped into a video that

1711.279 --> 1716.84
like demonstrated it even though there's

1714.48 --> 1721.3600000000001
lots of videos with vacuum Chambers like

1716.84 --> 1721.36
all over you too especially in the short

1725.159 --> 1729.64
sector ice boils but ice is a solid it

1728.559 --> 1733.1589999999999
can't

1729.64 --> 1736.519
boil boiling is liquid

1733.159 --> 1738.7990000000002
property and water boils but if you just

1736.519 --> 1743.3990000000001
have a block of ice what would it do if

1738.799 --> 1743.399
You' evacuate would it start to

1743.72 --> 1748.2
evaporate or will it actually keep

1746.039 --> 1750.72
sitting

1748.2 --> 1753.679
there like I don't

1750.72 --> 1757.08
know it's almost like a it melts and

1753.679 --> 1759.88
boil okay well I've never seen that I

1757.08 --> 1761.6
mean that makes sense logically but I've

1759.88 --> 1765.44
never seen

1761.6 --> 1768.1999999999998
it right and I mean in the whole Outer

1765.44 --> 1770.44
Space idea

1768.2 --> 1774.2
of how that's supposed to work there's

1770.44 --> 1775.559
like comets which are literally floating

1774.2 --> 1778.44
chunks of

1775.559 --> 1780.8799999999999
ice that are floating in the vacuum

1778.44 --> 1783.96
right so gives you something to think

1780.88 --> 1787.24
about kumu virus thanks for informing me

1783.96 --> 1789.32
though exactly what happens according to

1787.24 --> 1792.679
you and then remember there are

1789.32 --> 1796.32
supposedly comets flying

1792.679 --> 1799.3200000000002
around in outer space

1796.32 --> 1799.32
vacuum

1805.559 --> 1810.84
right but to see a demonstration of that

1808.2 --> 1812.919
would be interesting in my

1810.84 --> 1816.4399999999998
opinion right and I'm going to get my

1812.919 --> 1816.44
coffee I'll be right

1826.24 --> 1829.24
back

1856.24 --> 1859.24
for

1886.159 --> 1889.159
for

1903.519 --> 1906.1200000000001
all right I'm

1908.22 --> 1911.259
[Music]

1912.159 --> 1916.72
back

1914.24 --> 1919.679
what what are you talking about just got

1916.72 --> 1919.679
B that's

1921.639 --> 1926.399
hilarious you're going to test the globe

1923.84 --> 1929.4399999999998
claim that gas has wait that is amazing

1926.399 --> 1932.36
akumu virus I really applaud that

1929.44 --> 1936.039
idea if that's what you want to get a

1932.36 --> 1938.24
gas or a vacuum chamber together for it

1936.039 --> 1941.2
then yeah do it

1938.24 --> 1944.639
man dude I if you actually do that I'll

1941.2 --> 1944.6390000000001
want to make videos with

1945.559 --> 1949.08
you want to team

1949.76 --> 1955.48
up your cousin has a PhD in Psychology

1960.679 --> 1965.6000000000001
okay yeah

1963.32 --> 1968.84
skeptic I know

1965.6 --> 1972.799
it's never mind

1968.84 --> 1974.639
uh time you're doing going to do that

1972.799 --> 1976.519
awesome right but you're going to have

1974.639 --> 1978.4399999999998
to actually get the vacuum chamber

1976.519 --> 1980.48
though

1978.44 --> 1982.159
that is the condition for that if you

1980.48 --> 1986.559
actually have one and you want to like

1982.159 --> 1989.7990000000002
do test with that I want to like record

1986.559 --> 1992.8799999999999
it I want like the akumu

1989.799 --> 1995.24
logs of like hey akumu got a report and

1992.88 --> 1996.48
he did a couple of new tests with videos

1995.24 --> 1999.3990000000001
and then just

1996.48 --> 2003.3990000000001
talk I'd love to do

1999.399 --> 2005.9599999999998
that I have like an akumu

2003.399 --> 2008.8799999999999
report

2005.96 --> 2012.08
segment

2008.88 --> 2012.0800000000002
when you got something

2021.159 --> 2026.0
though yeah might be an interesting idea

2024.519 --> 2029.0
for

2026.0 --> 2031.2
2024 if you manage to get it

2029.0 --> 2033.72
together like

2031.2 --> 2035.519
that yeah exactly you got to build it

2033.72 --> 2040.08
first

2035.519 --> 2040.08
though it might turn out to be a bit

2040.2 --> 2044.1200000000001
complicated like if you can't get the

2042.32 --> 2048.96
right materials

2044.12 --> 2051.7999999999997
Etc right or like Supply chains are

2048.96 --> 2054.0
closed so you suddenly can't get that

2051.8 --> 2057.0
one specific type of motor that you

2054.0 --> 2059.159
really need for that right that sort of

2057.0 --> 2063.079
thing so you got to just check the

2059.159 --> 2065.2400000000002
grounds how how if you can get it

2063.079 --> 2068.8790000000004
together cuz if you just have some

2065.24 --> 2068.879
shitty cheap ass version

2070.399 --> 2074.7599999999998
that's like not really going to be a

2072.679 --> 2078.119
good vacuum chamber yeah then it's not

2074.76 --> 2078.119
really worth it I'd

2083.8 --> 2089.44
say yeah seeking star water I mean

2086.679 --> 2092.32
people aren't letting that one

2089.44 --> 2095.839
Go full water of

2092.32 --> 2098.28
gas yeah but it's a bottle though right

2095.839 --> 2100.2
and hey definitely right I mean the

2098.28 --> 2102.5600000000004
bottle that is filled with gas

2100.2 --> 2107.56
compressed gas is definitely going to

2102.56 --> 2111.68
have a slightly higher average

2107.56 --> 2113.16
density than it did when the gas was not

2111.68 --> 2116.5989999999997
compressed in

2113.16 --> 2119.1189999999997
there comparing to the surrounding air

2116.599 --> 2122.96
so yeah it's going to have some

2119.119 --> 2124.119
more rate registered on the scale but

2122.96 --> 2127.16
that's

2124.119 --> 2129.599
not actual gas inherent weight though

2127.16 --> 2132.56
without the scale or sorry without the

2129.599 --> 2135.2400000000002
tank you can't do that with gas no

2132.56 --> 2138.96
matter how thick it

2135.24 --> 2143.4399999999996
is no gas does not have weight hey

2138.96 --> 2143.44
Nathan Oakley 980 good see

2150.48 --> 2155.119
you gas does not go down go boom boom it

2153.4 --> 2157.839
goes in all

2155.119 --> 2160.599
directions now when you

2157.839 --> 2163.4
release gas from a tank where it was

2160.599 --> 2168.04
concentrated before and it had own

2163.4 --> 2172.1600000000003
peculiar density average compared to the

2168.04 --> 2174.88
air then for a while it might have a

2172.16 --> 2178.96
tendency to like either go up or go down

2174.88 --> 2182.44
like helium will just like go up a bit

2178.96 --> 2185.76
and in all directions and heav gases

2182.44 --> 2187.599
like silver exop fluoride it will go

2185.76 --> 2188.96
down

2187.599 --> 2191.079
and then in all

2188.96 --> 2193.2400000000002
directions right because in its

2191.079 --> 2197.079
concentrated form it's still denser than

2193.24 --> 2200.16
the air it does not have weight though

2197.079 --> 2202.8
you can't like take that gas put it on

2200.16 --> 2206.1189999999997
the scale and then expect

2202.8 --> 2209.079
it it's going to be consistent because

2206.119 --> 2213.6400000000003
entropy will always quickly set in

2209.079 --> 2213.6400000000003
making that expanded gas

2215.68 --> 2218.68
dissolve

2222.4 --> 2230.599
wow talk about projecting Chantry

2226.52 --> 2232.8
wood keep keep projecting for us funy I

2230.599 --> 2238.0
think we got the last funy of the year

2232.8 --> 2238.0
in the chat right now the last

2239.17 --> 2242.34
[Music]

2245.599 --> 2250.48
sputter

2248.599 --> 2254.3590000000004
I should not know anything in a yeah

2250.48 --> 2257.64
that was my question Adam akumu said no

2254.359 --> 2260.0789999999997
it's going to liquefy and then evaporate

2257.64 --> 2263.24
but I thought that ice water ice was

2260.079 --> 2267.2400000000002
specifically weird that it doesn't do

2263.24 --> 2269.64
that and that's why comets are out there

2267.24 --> 2269.64
in

2270.24 --> 2276.1189999999997
space right chunks of ice supposedly

2273.319 --> 2279.079
floating in a vacuum that would only be

2276.119 --> 2281.4
possible because of that but akumo here

2279.079 --> 2283.76
says that oh it just liquefies so I

2281.4 --> 2286.96
don't know man I haven't actually seen a

2283.76 --> 2289.1600000000003
visual demonstration of any of this

2286.96 --> 2293.28
despite YouTube being around and having

2289.16 --> 2293.2799999999997
all kinds of vacuum chamber related

2295.119 --> 2299.1600000000003
videos could water will initially boil

2297.64 --> 2301.4
then

2299.16 --> 2304.3999999999996
freeze

2301.4 --> 2304.4
what

2305.52 --> 2308.52
okay

2312.44 --> 2319.64
Earth is measured flat oh read a

2316.359 --> 2321.64
book yes what's the book going to tell

2319.64 --> 2327.48
you what's the book going to tell you

2321.64 --> 2330.1189999999997
Chantry what the the angles to the

2327.48 --> 2333.52
sun you you don't have to measure it

2330.119 --> 2336.1600000000003
right sticks in Shadows angles to the

2333.52 --> 2338.8
sun yeah that's all measured on a flat

2336.16 --> 2341.1189999999997
Earth it's all using flat

2338.8 --> 2343.92
baselines yeah Celestial

2341.119 --> 2347.44
navigation requires a flat Baseline to

2343.92 --> 2347.44
get that angle to the

2348.079 --> 2353.52
star yeah you're going to need a flat

2350.079 --> 2355.92
Earth for that Gentry

2353.52 --> 2360.359
wood it's measured

2355.92 --> 2362.88
flat and we can do Celestial

2360.359 --> 2365.5989999999997
navigation because the Earth is flat if

2362.88 --> 2368.56
it wasn't flat it wouldn't work we would

2365.599 --> 2371.48
just be stuck on a ball not getting very

2368.56 --> 2373.64
far always being afraid of what is over

2371.48 --> 2377.64
that sphere at your horizon because we

2373.64 --> 2379.359
can't see far in reality we can see far

2377.64 --> 2381.2799999999997
and we have a flat Baseline to get

2379.359 --> 2384.839
angles to stars with and that's why you

2381.28 --> 2387.4
can now use the Stars reliably to

2384.839 --> 2390.4
navigate The Flat

2387.4 --> 2390.4
Earth

2394.92 --> 2398.4
huh cheers

2398.48 --> 2401.48
Happy New Year to you

2425.359 --> 2428.359
too

2443.119 --> 2449.04
wow you can see the Sun that far a

2445.92 --> 2451.8
distance guys how far how do you know

2449.04 --> 2451.8
it's that far

2454.76 --> 2462.0400000000004
away have any other examples of things

2458.44 --> 2466.359
that that can be visible at that kind of

2462.04 --> 2470.2
distance that you can prove oh no it's

2466.359 --> 2475.04
just a madeup enormous number that does

2470.2 --> 2480.56
not relate to anything real or measured

2475.04 --> 2480.56
yeah that's what that is Chantry

2485.24 --> 2490.1189999999997
wood

2487.8 --> 2492.8390000000004
it's just an arbitrary number there is

2490.119 --> 2497.599
no proof that

2492.839 --> 2500.119
site can actually have that kind of

2497.599 --> 2500.119
distance

2500.24 --> 2504.1189999999997
bridged there's no proof of

2505.839 --> 2512.839
that that we don't have enough space on

2510.52 --> 2516.24
the Flat

2512.839 --> 2518.7599999999998
Earth to actually prove that you can see

2516.24 --> 2518.7599999999998
see that

2519.28 --> 2522.28
far

2527.839 --> 2535.16
right yeah so there's no actual downto

2531.359 --> 2538.2
earth physical proof that site can reach

2535.16 --> 2540.72
that far yeah I mean it's a very simple

2538.2 --> 2543.24
statement that I'm making

2540.72 --> 2547.52
here but you seem to think that it's

2543.24 --> 2551.52
perfectly fine to rest on the idea that

2547.52 --> 2554.319
you have absolutely no measured physics

2551.52 --> 2556.48
related proof for that the sun is 93 or

2554.319 --> 2559.8
98 what whatever you say Million Miles

2556.48 --> 2561.28
Away very far away and if you can see

2559.8 --> 2563.2000000000003
that then how all these other things

2561.28 --> 2566.6800000000003
yeah yeah yeah yeah but the thing is

2563.2 --> 2569.5589999999997
it's not that far away it isn't provably

2566.68 --> 2574.2
at any distance at

2569.559 --> 2578.1600000000003
all or any specific location in ukian

2574.2 --> 2578.16
space for that matter

2581.92 --> 2585.2400000000002
yeah you count the ad homes for me n no

2584.0 --> 2588.2
I'm just going to ignore them I'm just

2585.24 --> 2591.04
going to keep rolling it out that's a

2588.2 --> 2594.319
lovely thing about it is that you can't

2591.04 --> 2597.2
rumpus the show hosts when you can only

2594.319 --> 2597.2
rump Us in the

2597.76 --> 2603.3190000000004
chat so you can't interrupt me and I

2601.119 --> 2605.079
love

2603.319 --> 2608.079
it

2605.079 --> 2608.079
irrelevant

2608.44 --> 2611.96
no no it's

2612.0 --> 2615.839
projecting it's a nonstop

2620.88 --> 2623.88
projection

2625.16 --> 2632.96
yeah right and and it ironically enough

2628.24 --> 2636.68
my education system actually didn't fail

2632.96 --> 2637.8
me while I was in the school

2636.68 --> 2642.1189999999997
middle

2637.8 --> 2645.04
school I had the enormous privilege to

2642.119 --> 2648.6800000000003
be able to have been told about how

2645.04 --> 2651.5589999999997
Newtonian gravity is actually

2648.68 --> 2654.16
outdated like while I was being taught

2651.559 --> 2655.3190000000004
not way after where you already assume

2654.16 --> 2659.04
it's all

2655.319 --> 2661.119
real so I my education system actually

2659.04 --> 2664.24
didn't really fail

2661.119 --> 2667.2400000000002
me it helped me out so that I didn't get

2664.24 --> 2670.68
caught in delusions because there

2667.24 --> 2670.68
because I just had a couple of good

2675.4 --> 2684.0
teachers right I mean education systems

2680.2 --> 2686.0789999999997
fall and Thrive with the teachers they

2684.0 --> 2688.559
have and how they do

2686.079 --> 2690.96
it what drives them what they really

2688.559 --> 2693.6400000000003
care about right do they care that

2690.96 --> 2695.48
everybody thinks exactly like them or

2693.64 --> 2697.72
that they're part of the group whatever

2695.48 --> 2699.52
that is that at the time or do they

2697.72 --> 2703.9199999999996
really care about the individual and

2699.52 --> 2703.92
their capacity to understand

2711.72 --> 2721.319
things oh I in a vacuum okay okay I'll

2718.52 --> 2721.319
take a look

2721.96 --> 2727.88
atam oh goody and

2724.88 --> 2727.88
ass

2741.04 --> 2748.16
oh this is not just a little bit of ice

2743.8 --> 2748.1600000000003
just not a giant pile of

2750.2 --> 2753.2
ice

2753.44 --> 2757.88
okay does seem to melt

2765.839 --> 2769.319
what what's going

2769.44 --> 2773.48
on okay I'm not getting the

2784.8 --> 2787.8
text

2810.48 --> 2813.76
weird Okay

2814.8 --> 2817.8
so

2823.4 --> 2831.44
wow look at the comment there Adam this

2827.599 --> 2836.0
was amazing you have proven not only

2831.44 --> 2839.119
water ice but also cold liquid water can

2836.0 --> 2844.28
exist on the surface of

2839.119 --> 2844.28
Mars just six milars of

2844.72 --> 2848.9599999999996
fresh

2846.8 --> 2852.28
that's the comments that are in there

2848.96 --> 2852.28
Adam it's

2874.72 --> 2877.72
hilarious

2897.28 --> 2900.4
right this is kind of

2901.16 --> 2906.7999999999997
hilarious Ballers really coming in at

2903.76 --> 2909.0400000000004
the last the last show is still like no

2906.8 --> 2910.559
it's a bow this year it was a ball it

2909.04 --> 2914.4
was a

2910.559 --> 2914.4
bow no

2934.599 --> 2942.0
no was proven 2,000 years ago

2938.839 --> 2944.24
no Oh you mean the story about a guy who

2942.0 --> 2945.92
put sticks in the ground and then

2944.24 --> 2949.0
presupposed the Earth was a ball

2945.92 --> 2952.64
underneath in order to have the sh

2949.0 --> 2955.24
Suncast Shadows with those

2952.64 --> 2957.48
angles yeah yeah that's called

2955.24 --> 2960.359
presupposing the Earth is spherical in

2957.48 --> 2963.079
order to explain the

2960.359 --> 2966.24
Shadows that you require a flat Baseline

2963.079 --> 2969.92
to get by the way the angles to that to

2966.24 --> 2972.04
the source of that but other than that

2969.92 --> 2974.6800000000003
yeah yeah it's there's another thing

2972.04 --> 2978.68
about it you know this aristot right the

2974.68 --> 2981.3999999999996
thing about aristes is he probably never

2978.68 --> 2983.8799999999997
existed you know why because the

2981.4 --> 2987.64
evidence that he

2983.88 --> 2989.359
existed is from a book from a writer

2987.64 --> 2992.799
those old Greek

2989.359 --> 2997.24
days and he wrote that

2992.799 --> 3000.559
book about aristot him doing that before

2997.24 --> 3002.16
a stes was on record

3000.559 --> 3006.0400000000004
born

3002.16 --> 3008.16
so yeah he didn't exist your proof that

3006.04 --> 3010.079
merely presupposes the Earth is

3008.16 --> 3012.8799999999997
spherical beneath you in order to

3010.079 --> 3016.0
explain the Shadows from a Celestial

3012.88 --> 3019.04
light comes from a person that actually

3016.0 --> 3022.76
never existed was a fictional Showcase

3019.04 --> 3024.24
of the time to try to convince people

3022.76 --> 3027.88
that they were on a

3024.24 --> 3032.64
globe by making them presuppose

3027.88 --> 3032.6400000000003
it it was probably made up by that

3037.2 --> 3042.799
writer right so it's kind of like oh

3040.44 --> 3047.4
yeah well he wrote it with a

3042.799 --> 3051.68
ballpen oh but those didn't exist yet

3047.4 --> 3051.6800000000003
yeah was just really

3053.079 --> 3059.559
inventive yeah aristot

3056.68 --> 3059.5589999999997
and that other

3073.319 --> 3079.5589999999997
thing we know they exist we lost the

3077.24 --> 3082.2799999999997
technology it's too painful to put it

3079.559 --> 3082.28
back together

3083.88 --> 3090.2400000000002
again there's no space then we are we're

3086.96 --> 3092.559
in a realm we're in a a specific

3090.24 --> 3095.16
available

3092.559 --> 3097.0
volume at the top of that available

3095.16 --> 3099.04
volume there's a lot of room that is

3097.0 --> 3102.4
being filled by

3099.04 --> 3104.119
gas and at the bottom part and who knows

3102.4 --> 3106.04
how long this

3104.119 --> 3112.0
stretches

3106.04 --> 3112.0
there's rocks and dirt and

3113.799 --> 3120.4
water so

3116.319 --> 3123.04
we are in a space but that space is

3120.4 --> 3125.839
definitely not infinite size and is

3123.04 --> 3129.0
definitely not

3125.839 --> 3131.92
evacuated from

3129.0 --> 3133.16
gas there's an available volume and the

3131.92 --> 3136.559
gas that is

3133.16 --> 3140.68
available and open presses in all

3136.559 --> 3143.44
directions to meet the available

3140.68 --> 3146.0
volume and fill it and that's what we're

3143.44 --> 3148.04
breathing we're breathing all the gas

3146.0 --> 3150.24
that is filling the available volume of

3148.04 --> 3150.24
this

3151.2 --> 3159.04
realm that's where we are there's

3154.52 --> 3160.559
nothing around us or on the other side

3159.04 --> 3163.319
of the

3160.559 --> 3166.2000000000003
bottom what we're standing

3163.319 --> 3169.0
on there is just like a membrane that

3166.2 --> 3171.9199999999996
surrounds us that's the available volume

3169.0 --> 3176.559
we don't even know what that is what

3171.92 --> 3179.119
that membrane would be if it's like a

3176.559 --> 3184.3190000000004
a glass

3179.119 --> 3186.6800000000003
dome right or something else or whether

3184.319 --> 3189.359
it's even a physical structure at

3186.68 --> 3192.359
all maybe it's just like

3189.359 --> 3195.5589999999997
yeah physical space available for

3192.359 --> 3198.839
material simply doesn't exist outside of

3195.559 --> 3201.8390000000004
it there's just nothing nons

3198.839 --> 3206.4
space right prove my claims yeah know

3201.839 --> 3210.2799999999997
it's logical inference you see gas

3206.4 --> 3212.319
laws prove it gas expand in all

3210.28 --> 3215.079
directions to meet the available volume

3212.319 --> 3218.2799999999997
that's just basic fundamental gas law

3215.079 --> 3220.119
and well there has to be a limited

3218.28 --> 3221.7200000000003
volume in order for us to have gas

3220.119 --> 3225.079
pressure like we

3221.72 --> 3228.2799999999997
do unless you want to suggest the entire

3225.079 --> 3229.88
outer space universe and and all the

3228.28 --> 3233.7200000000003
galaxies and everything in between is

3229.88 --> 3235.319
all filled with gas like pretty close to

3233.72 --> 3237.319
what we got here if that's your your

3235.319 --> 3240.44
claim then I'm like oh yeah sure that's

3237.319 --> 3243.7599999999998
possible I mean not really

3240.44 --> 3245.16
but at least that that that solves the

3243.76 --> 3249.079
problem of

3245.16 --> 3252.96
the thermodynamics violation you

3249.079 --> 3252.96
know the outer gas

3262.24 --> 3269.7599999999998
Universe yeah it's not to kick some

3265.319 --> 3269.7599999999998
these trolls out this is

3279.799 --> 3288.119
lame just kind of copy paste some horse

3283.599 --> 3288.119
[ __ ] think that makes it all right

3293.559 --> 3299.1600000000003
nah yeah that's right now good call

3296.76 --> 3299.1600000000003
Richie

3307.119 --> 3314.4
G that's right akumu virus it fills the

3311.24 --> 3318.2799999999997
space if it's able and it

3314.4 --> 3323.0
is there's nothing preventing gas from

3318.28 --> 3325.6800000000003
escaping into the available space

3323.0 --> 3327.44
nothing only

3325.68 --> 3330.5589999999997
from what we

3327.44 --> 3334.48
know a physical barrier can prevent it

3330.559 --> 3334.48
no gas does not have weight

3340.44 --> 3344.079
dumbass oh my

3354.0 --> 3357.0
God

3370.68 --> 3376.7599999999998
that's right Richard G well said hey OVA

3374.119 --> 3376.76
Paul good to see

3383.92 --> 3386.92
you

3392.319 --> 3396.96
so which science fi are you an expert

3397.68 --> 3401.1189999999997
in physics

3405.96 --> 3412.799
mostly which is like kind of tough

3408.96 --> 3416.88
because there's so many retards out

3412.799 --> 3419.079
there like yourself

3416.88 --> 3421.359
that all think that they are Masters at

3419.079 --> 3424.8390000000004
physics when they're all Masters at

3421.359 --> 3427.839
balard physics which are wrong

3424.839 --> 3427.839
demonstrably

3443.799 --> 3446.799
wrong

3456.079 --> 3462.92
I know weighing a gas cylinder yeah but

3458.48 --> 3464.2400000000002
that's not gas is it that's not gas in a

3462.92 --> 3466.76
free

3464.24 --> 3470.24
state yeah why don't you put a little

3466.76 --> 3473.1600000000003
bit of gas in it

3470.24 --> 3475.839
right and keep it

3473.16 --> 3478.0389999999998
open and then put it on the scale oh

3475.839 --> 3480.44
it's it's just going to register the

3478.039 --> 3483.7990000000004
original weight the original Factory

3480.44 --> 3487.079
weight then is it yeah yeah because gas

3483.799 --> 3490.4
in its expanded State on average

3487.079 --> 3493.3590000000004
typically pretty much weighs not

3490.4 --> 3496.319
actually weigh appears to weigh relative

3493.359 --> 3500.119
density disequilibrium with the

3496.319 --> 3502.96
surrounding exerts some cial weight on

3500.119 --> 3505.76
the skill the device that is being used

3502.96 --> 3509.359
for that

3505.76 --> 3512.5200000000004
it's not going to have any difference CU

3509.359 --> 3515.839
it's pretty much the same as what

3512.52 --> 3520.24
surrounds it but hey if you compress

3515.839 --> 3523.0389999999998
stuff yeah then it becomes more more

3520.24 --> 3526.4399999999996
dense but you have to put it in an

3523.039 --> 3530.3190000000004
unnatural State yeah in a in a gas tank

3526.44 --> 3530.319
gas tanks don't exist in nature like

3531.68 --> 3538.2
that cuz gas will not just

3535.68 --> 3542.319
voluntarily let itself get compressed in

3538.2 --> 3543.52
a tank tanks that don't exist in nature

3542.319 --> 3547.359
that's just going to move in all

3543.52 --> 3547.359
directions that's what gases normally

3553.72 --> 3559.2799999999997
do density dis equili no it's actually

3556.799 --> 3561.28
there's another word for it [ __ ] face

3559.28 --> 3563.6400000000003
it's called specific

3561.28 --> 3565.28
gravity

3563.64 --> 3567.359
yeah

3565.28 --> 3569.599
it's official there's nothing made up

3567.359 --> 3569.5989999999997
about

3572.839 --> 3578.0789999999997
it you got any more shitty excuses or

3576.64 --> 3580.64
you just going to rage quit like a

3578.079 --> 3584.0
[ __ ] [ __ ] that you really

3580.64 --> 3584.0
are because you

3593.64 --> 3596.64
should

3610.96 --> 3616.839
vacuum Chambers weigh more with normal

3613.839 --> 3620.24
pressure yeah no

3616.839 --> 3622.7599999999998
[ __ ] or rather they weigh less with a

3620.24 --> 3625.2
vacuum akum you got to get it correct

3622.76 --> 3630.039
right this Assemble

3625.2 --> 3632.4399999999996
the vacuum chamber first put all the

3630.039 --> 3633.96
parts of it including the glue if you're

3632.44 --> 3637.559
going to use it

3633.96 --> 3639.559
whatever you put it all on the scale

3637.559 --> 3642.3590000000004
then you take the number of all the

3639.559 --> 3645.2400000000002
loose parts of that vacuum chamber

3642.359 --> 3646.839
before you're going to assemble it yeah

3645.24 --> 3650.16
you're going to have a certain WID then

3646.839 --> 3651.96
you put it together yeah now you put it

3650.16 --> 3654.2
put together on a scale it's going to

3651.96 --> 3656.0
have pretty much the same weight yeah

3654.2 --> 3658.3999999999996
now you're you're going to draw vacuum

3656.0 --> 3660.559
in your vacuum chamber that is assembled

3658.4 --> 3663.92
and now you put

3660.559 --> 3666.2400000000002
it in that state on the scale and guess

3663.92 --> 3669.96
what it's going to weigh slightly less

3666.24 --> 3672.9199999999996
what you mean less than the actual

3669.96 --> 3677.599
weights of the consecutive parts of the

3672.92 --> 3682.319
thing yeah that's right yeah because a

3677.599 --> 3687.119
vacuum in the weight

3682.319 --> 3691.0389999999998
idea yeah is negative weight yeah that's

3687.119 --> 3692.52
right yeah a vacuum is negative weight

3691.039 --> 3695.2000000000003
in that

3692.52 --> 3699.599
sense yeah if you're going to do it like

3695.2 --> 3702.96
a plus and minus calculation type thing

3699.599 --> 3705.6400000000003
yeah it's negative weight you yeah yeah

3702.96 --> 3706.799
except that absolutely makes no damn

3705.64 --> 3708.96
sense

3706.799 --> 3710.96
whatsoever if you're going to look at it

3708.96 --> 3712.839
from a physics perspective

3710.96 --> 3716.44
so that's

3712.839 --> 3716.44
why weight

3716.559 --> 3721.76
it doesn't

3718.64 --> 3724.5989999999997
apply it's not

3721.76 --> 3728.88
inherent yeah if you change the state of

3724.599 --> 3731.6800000000003
a material then the weight of it changes

3728.88 --> 3734.6400000000003
and if you change it to gas it's gone

3731.68 --> 3734.64
there is no more

3743.359 --> 3746.359
weight

3749.799 --> 3755.44
netive weight is yeah yeah yeah yeah I

3752.52 --> 3759.079
know I know Gentry would you [ __ ]

3755.44 --> 3760.559
[ __ ] the problem is that is what the

3759.079 --> 3764.559
scale will

3760.559 --> 3768.119
register yeah it BS yeah it's going to

3764.559 --> 3771.599
be the result of the process though [ __ ]

3768.119 --> 3771.599
face [ __ ]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
[ __ ]

3778.76 --> 3783.079
get the [ __ ] out of here stop wasting my

3781.039 --> 3788.2000000000003
time with your

3783.079 --> 3792.1600000000003
[ __ ] been amusing enough long enough now

3788.2 --> 3796.4399999999996
it's time to [ __ ] off let's get back

3792.16 --> 3796.44
to so normal form of

3803.279 --> 3806.279
communication

3812.48 --> 3815.2400000000002
oh this

3833.279 --> 3836.279
is

3838.92 --> 3846.4
CLS way more in vacuum because air has

3842.0 --> 3848.52
weight to this place so not wait then to

3846.4 --> 3849.52
this place well it doesn't register

3848.52 --> 3852.24
though on the

3849.52 --> 3854.7599999999998
scale

3852.24 --> 3859.16
yeah oh you put the scale out oh yeah

3854.76 --> 3859.1600000000003
it's zero zero

3860.52 --> 3866.2
difference yeah put the scale in the

3863.64 --> 3866.2
vacuum chain

3868.88 --> 3872.079
chamber what

3878.359 --> 3882.5589999999997
happens is it going to go into the

3885.039 --> 3891.6400000000003
minus it

3886.92 --> 3896.279
is it will want it yeah oh you're going

3891.64 --> 3897.839
to have that negative weight again of a

3896.279 --> 3900.48
vacuum

3897.839 --> 3902.359
huh oh no no it's just the air that's

3900.48 --> 3906.52
missing yeah except when you normally

3902.359 --> 3906.52
weigh something yet though air is

3906.88 --> 3915.6800000000003
zero that's the point it's zero yeah so

3911.96 --> 3919.119
that means the vacuum is minus weight

3915.68 --> 3921.72
negative weight yeah because weight it's

3919.119 --> 3925.1600000000003
just a dumbass convention it's not a

3921.72 --> 3927.68
physical inherent thing property of

3925.16 --> 3932.5589999999997
material that is universal in every

3927.68 --> 3932.5589999999997
state it isn't it's just a dumb

3932.88 --> 3940.839
convention based on the pressure exerted

3937.44 --> 3943.68
by an object in a medium of air at

3940.839 --> 3946.64
ground level let's

3943.68 --> 3951.44
wait it's a convention it's not a

3946.64 --> 3956.0389999999998
material inherent thing that exists in

3951.44 --> 3959.039
all states it doesn't

3956.039 --> 3962.88
it's a convention based of

3959.039 --> 3965.039
disequilibrium pressure of an object

3962.88 --> 3969.0
with the medium it is

3965.039 --> 3969.0
in that's what weight

3974.119 --> 3981.319
is if it's not at this equilibrium with

3977.319 --> 3984.52
the medium then it will not

3981.319 --> 3987.319
register at all but if it's in dise

3984.52 --> 3990.68
equilibrium with the medium by being

3987.319 --> 3993.96
less dense than the medium then the

3990.68 --> 3999.5589999999997
scale process will suddenly give you a

3993.96 --> 4002.4
minus weight because it's a convention

3999.559 --> 4006.7200000000003
it's not Material

4002.4 --> 4009.039
inherent it's a thing you do a number

4006.72 --> 4013.0
you derive from a

4009.039 --> 4014.6400000000003
process it's not Material inherent it's

4013.0 --> 4017.359
process

4014.64 --> 4019.4
inherent comes from the process of what

4017.359 --> 4022.72
you're doing the

4019.4 --> 4025.6800000000003
comparing the pressure of it it's a

4022.72 --> 4028.72
process from which you

4025.68 --> 4032.319
deriving this thing you call

4028.72 --> 4036.2
weight it's not Material

4032.319 --> 4038.5589999999997
inherent it's setup inherent it depends

4036.2 --> 4040.8799999999997
on the setup on the scenario on the

4038.559 --> 4044.92
relation of the object and the medium it

4040.88 --> 4047.92
is in the density and the equilibrium or

4044.92 --> 4050.92
disequilibrium between them and that is

4047.92 --> 4054.48
what results in this pressure that you

4050.92 --> 4058.0
can register as weight and give a number

4054.48 --> 4061.2400000000002
to it it's not Material inherent it's

4058.0 --> 4066.559
scenario inherent depends on what the

4061.24 --> 4066.5589999999997
setup is in order for that to be the end

4072.92 --> 4076.6800000000003
result

4074.64 --> 4078.319
unless you zero the skill with air in

4076.68 --> 4080.5989999999997
the chamber oh and that's not what

4078.319 --> 4084.92
you're supposed to do then akumu

4080.599 --> 4084.92
virus aren't you supposed to do

4087.2 --> 4091.3999999999996
that isn't that how weight Works isn't

4090.0 --> 4095.239
that what you're supposed to be doing

4091.4 --> 4098.2390000000005
with the scale in order to measure the

4095.239 --> 4098.239
weight

4100.729 --> 4105.839
[Music]

4102.839 --> 4105.839
bro

4105.92 --> 4111.159
it's [ __ ] yeah know [ __ ] Sherlock

4108.52 --> 4114.799000000001
it's what you'll register though it's

4111.159 --> 4117.96
[ __ ] yeah reality is

4114.799 --> 4121.199
[ __ ] no you're just

4117.96 --> 4123.6
[ __ ] and a blabber mouth who needs

4121.199 --> 4125.4
to blabber out their opinions when they

4123.6 --> 4127.679
obviously don't understand what's even

4125.4 --> 4127.679
being

4128.239 --> 4134.2789999999995
discussed blabber

4131.48 --> 4137.239
mouth it's m as where that's it's

4134.279 --> 4139.56
ridiculous yeah it's going to register

4137.239 --> 4142.199
on the scale though [ __ ] face it's

4139.56 --> 4144.64
ridiculous yeah it's reality reality is

4142.199 --> 4146.759
ridiculous right when you don't

4144.64 --> 4149.2390000000005
understand how it works and you've been

4146.759 --> 4151.44
misled on how it works and now you see

4149.239 --> 4154.3189999999995
how it works and then oh what I thought

4151.44 --> 4156.96
how it works yeah it didn't work yeah

4154.319 --> 4159.96
because you had it

4156.96 --> 4164.319
wrong

4159.96 --> 4167.279
dumbass telling you how it is right here

4164.319 --> 4167.279
you don't have to like

4192.719 --> 4195.719
it

4204.239 --> 4209.599999999999
Hey DJ

4205.52 --> 4209.6
one good to see you how you

4222.64 --> 4225.64
doing

4241.679 --> 4247.4
wait to displacement oh we forgot it oh

4245.159 --> 4247.4
yeah

4248.159 --> 4256.4
sure I'm sure he forgot it during his

4251.8 --> 4256.400000000001
hour presentation no he didn't forget

4268.96 --> 4274.88
it yeah he does he does mention buoyancy

4272.64 --> 4279.2390000000005
is what you're talking about and he

4274.88 --> 4279.2390000000005
absolutely does mention that akumu

4279.44 --> 4284.159
virus in the presentation he gave it was

4282.679 --> 4286.679
definitely there

4284.159 --> 4286.679
I was

4294.84 --> 4299.92
there that's right Adam it just gets a

4298.159 --> 4302.32
little bit too complicated the whole

4299.92 --> 4304.92
problem is is that this is just it's

4302.32 --> 4308.5199999999995
it's going into that stupid hypothetical

4304.92 --> 4311.1990000000005
I mean this whole oh something should

4308.52 --> 4314.4400000000005
weigh less in a vacuum

4311.199 --> 4316.839999999999
chamber that that is just like like oh

4314.44 --> 4319.36
yeah the airplane should be taking

4316.84 --> 4321.159000000001
longer because of the earth spin it's

4319.36 --> 4323.5199999999995
like yeah yeah yeah but that isn't

4321.159 --> 4327.92
happening and so everybody on the ball

4323.52 --> 4327.92
side will argue exactly how it isn't

4330.76 --> 4337.1990000000005
happening I I'm just like I don't want

4333.6 --> 4339.6
to tell globers anymore how the things

4337.199 --> 4343.48
should be on a ball like

4339.6 --> 4345.96
that because all they do is just end up

4343.48 --> 4347.919999999999
denying how things should be on a ball

4345.96 --> 4350.76
like that because it isn't in reality

4347.92 --> 4353.4400000000005
and I'm kind of sick of

4350.76 --> 4356.280000000001
it like I don't want to try to explain

4353.44 --> 4358.5599999999995
to a baller anymore how reality should

4356.28 --> 4361.88
be if the Earth is a ball because they

4358.56 --> 4361.88
just don't accept it

4372.44 --> 4375.44
anyway

4384.44 --> 4387.919999999999
see see what I

4391.36 --> 4397.199
mean and that's why I technically think

4394.52 --> 4399.360000000001
that what Brian has been doing and that

4397.199 --> 4401.04
presentation like it's all very cute and

4399.36 --> 4404.92
everyone everyone thought it was all

4401.04 --> 4407.12
cool I think it's completely pointless

4404.92 --> 4410.1990000000005
because you're never going to get

4407.12 --> 4414.32
globers to agree to that like any

4410.199 --> 4417.719
globers ever as in any single individual

4414.32 --> 4420.239
ever on any level of the scale of globe

4417.719 --> 4423.8
belief you will never get anyone to

4420.239 --> 4426.199
agree to that to that hypothetical you

4423.8 --> 4427.96
might get a glob believer to agree that

4426.199 --> 4429.239
yeah things do deviate because of the

4427.96 --> 4431.28
Earth spinning

4429.239 --> 4433.36
underneath right you'll get them to

4431.28 --> 4435.84
agree to that you'll never get them to

4433.36 --> 4437.96
to agree to this one to this thing that

4435.84 --> 4441.12
Brian wanted to emphasize in the last

4437.96 --> 4441.12
month never

4441.639 --> 4448.1990000000005
ever and I immediately protested as he

4445.96 --> 4451.88
brought it onto the table and every oh

4448.199 --> 4454.12
are you always in my way are wi no this

4451.88 --> 4456.6
is how it is like yeah oh well there's

4454.12 --> 4459.239
literally zero globers in the entire

4456.6 --> 4462.280000000001
[ __ ] world that ever will or ever

4459.239 --> 4465.28
have claimed that they don't and they

4462.28 --> 4465.28
want

4467.32 --> 4471.92
maybe better to just get them to try to

4470.159 --> 4474.5199999999995
ruin their own reference frames or

4471.92 --> 4477.4400000000005
something because no glober will ever

4474.52 --> 4480.360000000001
say yeah of course things should weigh

4477.44 --> 4484.159
less in a vacuum none of them will ever

4480.36 --> 4486.639
say that none will ever bring never even

4484.159 --> 4489.32
say that by

4486.639 --> 4492.28
accident because they lost track or

4489.32 --> 4495.28
something none of them

4492.28 --> 4495.28
do

4495.719 --> 4498.719
Brian is correct yeah that's all very

4497.48 --> 4501.44
cute I

4498.719 --> 4504.36
know but it doesn't work because there

4501.44 --> 4508.44
is no glober in the world that will ever

4504.36 --> 4513.5199999999995
admit to it or ever has in the

4508.44 --> 4513.5199999999995
past so it's no point in bringing that

4515.639 --> 4522.1990000000005
up it's like trying to prove elaborately

4519.44 --> 4524.04
how there is no molten iron

4522.199 --> 4527.678999999999
core

4524.04 --> 4530.56
like yeah there's nothing

4527.679 --> 4534.32
there there's nothing to do that

4530.56 --> 4536.2390000000005
with globers have not made those claims

4534.32 --> 4538.679
well yeah it is a hypothetical that you

4536.239 --> 4539.718999999999
should conclude out of the mechanism

4538.679 --> 4543.28
that they

4539.719 --> 4545.2390000000005
wielded but they never claimed it worked

4543.28 --> 4547.88
like that so there's no point in

4545.239 --> 4547.879999999999
claiming

4548.0 --> 4554.92
that you will never get them to agree or

4551.12 --> 4559.04
admit it ever even by by

4554.92 --> 4559.04
accident hey LSG good to see

4561.639 --> 4567.0
you and Adam me too by the way got a

4564.679 --> 4567.0
full

4593.88 --> 4597.1990000000005
sounds like it's all Sean

4612.08 --> 4615.08
socks

4619.76 --> 4626.56
all right so instead of claiming oh

4624.0 --> 4630.44
according to the

4626.56 --> 4632.6
gloop things in a vacuum should we less

4630.44 --> 4634.799999999999
I'm like yeah that's [ __ ] pointless I

4632.6 --> 4637.679
mean leave it to the Irishman to throw

4634.8 --> 4639.8
that out I'm not doing that I'm just

4637.679 --> 4642.0
going to point out like yeah yeah gas

4639.8 --> 4644.639
doesn't have

4642.0 --> 4647.08
weight seems much more triggering in a

4644.639 --> 4649.28
way even though we're basically like

4647.08 --> 4653.84
doing the same thing I'm just not trying

4649.28 --> 4653.84
to emphasize a claim that has never been

4657.36 --> 4662.12
made this good luck with that

4664.239 --> 4672.0
skeptic Sean is the that's that's just a

4668.639 --> 4673.84
straight out lot lva

4672.0 --> 4679.0
Paul

4673.84 --> 4679.0
he is in fact the dumbest anti flat

4696.239 --> 4701.839999999999
earther thanks for not putting straw man

4698.679 --> 4703.88
claim on you yeah I'll just leave that

4701.84 --> 4706.679
to you

4703.88 --> 4708.92
oh not maybe you as much akumu virus but

4706.679 --> 4711.76
I mean yeah globers do that all the time

4708.92 --> 4714.36
and I'm like yeah let's not

4711.76 --> 4716.88
reciprocate let's just not do that with

4714.36 --> 4720.08
them there's no need like we don't need

4716.88 --> 4721.84
to we can just like keep pushing on the

4720.08 --> 4723.5599999999995
chinks in the armor that are just

4721.84 --> 4725.76
blatantly there we don't have to do

4723.56 --> 4727.400000000001
anything for that it's just there all we

4725.76 --> 4731.52
have to do is just put our fingers on it

4727.4 --> 4733.44
every time we don't have to make up [ __ ]

4731.52 --> 4736.1990000000005
or we don't have to like talk about

4733.44 --> 4739.5599999999995
this is what you should be claiming like

4736.199 --> 4742.719
yeah but they don't though oh it's not

4739.56 --> 4744.120000000001
consistent then yeah oh the globe claims

4742.719 --> 4748.56
are not

4744.12 --> 4751.639
consistent wow that's amazing yeah we

4748.56 --> 4755.92
know don't expect it to be

4751.639 --> 4755.92
consistent the point is they don't claim

4759.56 --> 4764.84
it is the 33d do no akum is not that

4783.04 --> 4790.159
D dude if every black man in

4786.96 --> 4791.6
America was a like a kumu virus I think

4790.159 --> 4795.599999999999
that

4791.6 --> 4800.639
like you would probably have like

4795.6 --> 4800.639
a a Fantastical restoration of

4800.96 --> 4805.32
America Akuma virus is pretty

4815.72 --> 4818.869000000001
[Music]

4820.04 --> 4825.28
awesome yeah what I mean you deserve it

4823.159 --> 4828.839999999999
man you're doing your best you're nice

4825.28 --> 4831.04
to be around you have knowledge you

4828.84 --> 4833.96
don't always use all your knowledge well

4831.04 --> 4838.08
but you have it and you're like Curious

4833.96 --> 4838.08
you keep growing and you're

4839.04 --> 4845.28
perceptive it's yeah I like you should

4842.56 --> 4848.719
be more people like you out there even

4845.28 --> 4851.719
though you can be a complete Bard I mean

4848.719 --> 4854.719
but I can be a spaz about certain things

4851.719 --> 4854.719
too

4861.48 --> 4867.839999999999
[Music]

4863.239 --> 4870.599999999999
so for by a yeah but Craig really is a

4867.84 --> 4874.84
dumb [ __ ] LV

4870.6 --> 4879.1990000000005
pole he is really terrible like so

4874.84 --> 4879.1990000000005
terrible that it makes me feel

4880.639 --> 4889.08
ashamed like I can feel the shame that

4883.76 --> 4891.719
he probably can't anymore or has become

4889.08 --> 4894.08
so used to ignoring that he doesn't

4891.719 --> 4898.52
really pick up on it anymore I can feel

4894.08 --> 4898.5199999999995
his shame in things okay that's

4899.32 --> 4905.239
bad Craig is really not in a good

4905.36 --> 4911.639
place so I definitely yeah kumu virus is

4909.6 --> 4914.639
way better than

4911.639 --> 4914.639
that

4926.84 --> 4931.84
and I mean just compare it guys just

4929.719 --> 4935.2390000000005
compare the

4931.84 --> 4937.52
behavior okay Akuma virus actually

4935.239 --> 4940.919999999999
you're kind of get used to having him

4937.52 --> 4943.2390000000005
around and can even have halfway decent

4940.92 --> 4945.92
conversations with him

4943.239 --> 4948.12
okay how's that how's that working out

4945.92 --> 4948.12
with

4948.4 --> 4954.48
Craig you know what I mean every time he

4952.28 --> 4957.88
shows up anywhere it just immediately

4954.48 --> 4962.959999999999
turns into this spaz off

4957.88 --> 4962.96
event yeah akum doesn't do

4969.679 --> 4974.56
that I don't think it's fair to compare

4972.199 --> 4974.5599999999995
them

4977.719 --> 4985.159
you can feel take it easy there Akuma

4980.719 --> 4985.159
don't I'm just trying to make a point

4998.92 --> 5004.4800000000005
here going to be stupid and drive a

5001.32 --> 5004.48
blizzard to re what

5005.48 --> 5012.638999999999
okay

5008.28 --> 5012.639
why but I guess take care of

5015.76 --> 5021.96
skeptic but seriously why are you going

5017.76 --> 5025.76
to drive through blizzard that sounds

5021.96 --> 5029.93
creepy I hope you have a thermal

5025.76 --> 5031.4800000000005
blankets with you just in

5035.36 --> 5040.08
Global a virus I appreciate not really

5038.96 --> 5043.08
you're

5040.08 --> 5043.08
old

5045.6 --> 5050.92
okay you're not that old what are you

5048.6 --> 5050.92
talking

5061.36 --> 5064.36
about

5091.36 --> 5095.119
ah

5093.159 --> 5097.36
who you think has done the most damage

5095.119 --> 5097.36
to

5098.8 --> 5104.08
Fe that's a funny question

5102.199 --> 5106.5199999999995
Tommy

5104.08 --> 5109.719
uh flat

5106.52 --> 5112.040000000001
earthers who does the most damage the

5109.719 --> 5114.119
people themselves yeah who does the most

5112.04 --> 5115.84
damage to the

5114.119 --> 5118.28
globe the

5115.84 --> 5121.28
globers who've done the most damage to

5118.28 --> 5124.28
Flat Earth flat

5121.28 --> 5124.28
earthers

5128.52 --> 5133.360000000001
I know akumu virus you're the

5131.44 --> 5136.719
best just

5133.36 --> 5136.719
kidding you

5145.44 --> 5154.28
good I mean

5148.44 --> 5154.28
freaking Jaren I'd say

5154.36 --> 5162.44
jiren has done more damage to Flat Earth

5158.679 --> 5165.159
than than any glob or could by just

5162.44 --> 5169.48
doing the things that he's

5165.159 --> 5172.92
done and his crazy interactions

5169.48 --> 5176.5599999999995
is is just persistent

5172.92 --> 5176.56
inconsistencies and

5179.84 --> 5185.119000000001
sloppiness just that that debate he did

5183.08 --> 5189.159
with mun it

5185.119 --> 5191.4
was unbelievably unbelievably stupid

5189.159 --> 5195.0
like that's what does the real damage to

5191.4 --> 5200.48
Flat Earth like that's the [ __ ] that

5195.0 --> 5200.48
deters newer Generations from doing

5202.84 --> 5211.0
that if I'd been like 15 or something

5206.84 --> 5216.4400000000005
I'd have seen like Jaren from now back

5211.0 --> 5218.199
then I'd be like [ __ ] that I'm staying

5216.44 --> 5221.5599999999995
the hell away from Flat Earth I don't

5218.199 --> 5224.44
want to turn into a [ __ ] [ __ ] like

5221.56 --> 5227.280000000001
that right now I hope I don't have that

5224.44 --> 5230.44
influence on people that watch my show

5227.28 --> 5233.679
I'm certainly trying not to be an

5230.44 --> 5236.199
unbearable dumb

5233.679 --> 5240.679
[ __ ] although I'm not completely

5236.199 --> 5240.678999999999
impervious to human

5241.119 --> 5244.119
faulty

5247.719 --> 5254.119
human error but

5250.44 --> 5256.08
uh yeah that does a lot of damage like

5254.119 --> 5257.36
who is who is out there who is

5256.08 --> 5259.08
representing us who are the good

5257.36 --> 5262.36
represented the good Representatives

5259.08 --> 5264.159
they do good people that just oh I want

5262.36 --> 5265.599999999999
the attention I want to be seen as the

5264.159 --> 5269.4
number one

5265.6 --> 5272.88
guy and they're more prioritizing that

5269.4 --> 5277.5599999999995
like that's the ones that do damage

5272.88 --> 5280.56
that dilute the message to get more

5277.56 --> 5283.320000000001
favor to make it easier on those who

5280.56 --> 5283.320000000001
wish to follow

5287.36 --> 5293.799999999999
them right and in that sense I mean

5290.92 --> 5295.92
globers just the way the standards that

5293.8 --> 5297.719
they have set among themselves like the

5295.92 --> 5300.92
anti flat earthers the standards they'

5297.719 --> 5303.4
set among themselves what they how they

5300.92 --> 5304.8
how that actually work works is like

5303.4 --> 5306.92
Guild

5304.8 --> 5311.159000000001
agreements it's

5306.92 --> 5313.32
like trickery technical wise they're

5311.159 --> 5315.199
just so used to having to do that that

5313.32 --> 5318.92
they don't even realize that that's

5315.199 --> 5320.839999999999
actually tinkering with reality and like

5318.92 --> 5323.679
you're not supposed to

5320.84 --> 5325.56
be revealing that that is something that

5323.679 --> 5329.1990000000005
you

5325.56 --> 5331.0
do but they do it and they Lo lost track

5329.199 --> 5334.96
of that you're not actually supposed to

5331.0 --> 5337.6
do that and have that be

5334.96 --> 5339.96
spotted and they've just normalized that

5337.6 --> 5341.4400000000005
it's like the the tinkering with reality

5339.96 --> 5343.84
the

5341.44 --> 5349.32
deception

5343.84 --> 5352.0
to favor a certain view of things is

5349.32 --> 5354.36
become normalized among the anti flat

5352.0 --> 5357.4
earthers that's doing a massive amount

5354.36 --> 5358.92
of damage because every Globe person

5357.4 --> 5360.599999999999
that might be like yeah I want to know

5358.92 --> 5363.36
if they really went to the moon or not

5360.6 --> 5365.0
what is this thing right

5363.36 --> 5368.0
they will look into that and they be

5365.0 --> 5373.159
like what the

5368.0 --> 5376.679
hell is that guy like a A cultist or

5373.159 --> 5380.638999999999
something like it would just seem like a

5376.679 --> 5380.639
mentally ill nerd to

5380.76 --> 5387.8
them so that's actually doing a lot of

5383.76 --> 5389.320000000001
damage to the to the the easy Globe

5387.8 --> 5391.679
default

5389.32 --> 5394.4
Faith because people will see like why

5391.679 --> 5397.92
is that guy talking complete nonsense

5394.4 --> 5401.119
doesn't he realize that we could just

5397.92 --> 5401.119
hear him say these

5401.96 --> 5406.52
things that does damage to the globe

5406.56 --> 5412.719
Faith yeah much more than any flat

5409.32 --> 5415.799999999999
earther that's like talking about how

5412.719 --> 5415.8
the globe is

5420.84 --> 5423.84
fake

5426.56 --> 5433.76
right anybody still here everybody just

5429.639 --> 5433.76
leave all of a sudden the

5449.84 --> 5457.4400000000005
[ __ ] I think of it like this this in

5454.08 --> 5461.5199999999995
politics the right wing and the left

5457.44 --> 5465.44
wing like who does the most

5461.52 --> 5467.719
damage they do to themselves right

5465.44 --> 5469.759999999999
because oh the other side this and that

5467.719 --> 5472.2390000000005
and this and that you're like used to

5469.76 --> 5474.76
that people don't even really listen

5472.239 --> 5478.678999999999
anymore it's just like yeah just

5474.76 --> 5482.6
posturing yeah but if that opponent

5478.679 --> 5485.8
actually [ __ ] up then it's like h

5482.6 --> 5488.360000000001
look at that look at that idiot and he

5485.8 --> 5490.6
thinks he's a winner right and that's

5488.36 --> 5491.92
like the other side's like Jesus why why

5490.6 --> 5493.96
do you have to do why do you have to be

5491.92 --> 5496.36
an

5493.96 --> 5497.96
idiot this is not good I want to be

5496.36 --> 5500.759999999999
associated with that

5497.96 --> 5504.96
[ __ ] like that's doing damage right it's

5500.76 --> 5508.4800000000005
not all the the left or all those crazy

5504.96 --> 5510.76
right Wingers like nobody cares what

5508.48 --> 5514.678999999999
you're going to say about your opponent

5510.76 --> 5516.88
really the most damage is those people

5514.679 --> 5518.719
[ __ ] up themselves as a

5516.88 --> 5519.8
representative that is what does the

5518.719 --> 5523.119
most

5519.8 --> 5523.119000000001
damage every

5523.159 --> 5531.0
time I mean

5525.719 --> 5534.96
any polarized setup with like which is

5531.0 --> 5537.76
like political in a way nobody gives a

5534.96 --> 5540.199
[ __ ] what you think of your opponent

5537.76 --> 5543.56
yeah nobody

5540.199 --> 5546.32
cares opponent doesn't care your

5543.56 --> 5549.4800000000005
comrades don't really care it's just

5546.32 --> 5553.36
posturing it's just like yeah the

5549.48 --> 5556.678999999999
opponent they don't really listen that

5553.36 --> 5558.799999999999
much but if an opponent is doing

5556.679 --> 5561.04
something and they [ __ ] up that gets

5558.8 --> 5564.360000000001
everybody's

5561.04 --> 5566.679
attention on their side and on your side

5564.36 --> 5566.679
every

5570.639 --> 5573.639
time

5581.48 --> 5585.5599999999995
don't like the

5582.639 --> 5589.639
ridicule that happens on both side yeah

5585.56 --> 5591.280000000001
I know it's kind of boring and a waste

5589.639 --> 5594.08
of

5591.28 --> 5596.5199999999995
time post I call it posturing it's just

5594.08 --> 5601.28
like o attitude attitude o I'm ready for

5596.52 --> 5603.080000000001
a battle ooh like yeah nobody cares not

5601.28 --> 5607.08
really

5603.08 --> 5607.08
we get it it's getting

5623.04 --> 5630.56
boring all right so just just to give

5626.88 --> 5634.0
something to think about to you

5630.56 --> 5636.6
guys that's what I like to do right just

5634.0 --> 5638.4
digging and digging and suddenly he like

5636.6 --> 5640.320000000001
it's like yeah it was there but you

5638.4 --> 5642.08
never really realized what the

5640.32 --> 5643.679
implications are and then suddenly that

5642.08 --> 5646.36
thing it was always there is like oh now

5643.679 --> 5646.36
you suddenly

5646.639 --> 5652.04
see there's a hidden part of that that

5649.239 --> 5654.4
you couldn't see before that's what I

5652.04 --> 5654.4
like to

5660.48 --> 5663.48
do

5670.119 --> 5675.239
all right so yeah has Simon Dan done

5675.52 --> 5681.56
damage to

5677.6 --> 5685.96
Fe well how would he have done that

5681.56 --> 5687.56
right so just the how how did Simon then

5685.96 --> 5691.88
do damage to

5687.56 --> 5695.119000000001
Fe how is that what is the damage and

5691.88 --> 5697.88
how did it like

5695.119 --> 5700.719
help you know let's just get very

5697.88 --> 5701.52
specific since you named Simon Dan as

5700.719 --> 5705.44
your

5701.52 --> 5705.4400000000005
example how did he do the

5707.32 --> 5711.88
damage I mean I'm pretty damn sure that

5709.76 --> 5716.159000000001
his video you and your reference frames

5711.88 --> 5719.8
are ruined did a lot of damage yeah not

5716.159 --> 5722.679
the Flat Earth though yeah see see what

5719.8 --> 5724.92
I mean

5722.679 --> 5727.2390000000005
we still know about that video though

5724.92 --> 5727.2390000000005
don't

5727.48 --> 5732.28
we and we don't know about it because of

5730.32 --> 5734.599999999999
the damage it did to us all the

5732.28 --> 5739.0
nightmare no it because of the damage it

5734.6 --> 5739.0
did to him and his

5740.96 --> 5743.96
credibility

5750.4 --> 5753.4
remember

5755.8 --> 5762.2390000000005
oh shut the hell up Akuma

5759.48 --> 5764.759999999999
virus every time I damn give you a

5762.239 --> 5767.5599999999995
compliment you always have to completely

5764.76 --> 5767.56
ruin it don't

5767.88 --> 5775.08
you don't be a dumb [ __ ] please don't

5772.28 --> 5778.4
get belligerant don't

5775.08 --> 5783.32
say every time now okay I'll just put

5778.4 --> 5783.32
you on a timeout if you do that

5786.159 --> 5790.879999999999
yeah now Nathan absolutely understood

5789.719 --> 5794.719
his

5790.88 --> 5796.36
point he didn't understand his own point

5794.719 --> 5800.92
cuz he's a dumb

5796.36 --> 5804.32
[ __ ] he doesn't understand the globe

5800.92 --> 5806.639
claim cuz simonan is arguably one of the

5804.32 --> 5810.28
dumbest people on the

5806.639 --> 5813.28
internet probably only surpassed by Shan

5810.28 --> 5813.28
Hawkins

5814.28 --> 5816.8
although

5833.08 --> 5838.639
barely yeah wrath that's what happens

5835.84 --> 5843.1990000000005
don't do it don't watch this videos it

5838.639 --> 5843.1990000000005
will make you dumber it literally does

5845.119 --> 5851.239
so who's doing more damage to the ball I

5847.28 --> 5853.28
say Simon Dan he's like measurably

5851.239 --> 5857.5199999999995
dumbing down his own

5853.28 --> 5857.5199999999995
Believers measurably dumbing him

5867.28 --> 5873.239
down shut up Akuma virus yeah opinion

5870.92 --> 5876.119
yeah nonsense double

5873.239 --> 5878.28
speak flub you can have your nonsense

5876.119 --> 5880.598999999999
double speaks flub just don't expect

5878.28 --> 5882.36
anybody to take that

5880.599 --> 5884.400000000001
serious it's

5882.36 --> 5884.8099999999995
driil that's coming out of here right

5884.4 --> 5887.969
now

5884.81 --> 5887.969
[Music]

5900.119 --> 5905.0
akumu

5901.679 --> 5907.719
yes Tommy yeah that's okay 300 people

5905.0 --> 5910.159
watching back then now 100 yeah Tommy

5907.719 --> 5912.04
but that's because we had very severe

5910.159 --> 5915.4
algorhythms

5912.04 --> 5915.4
Crackdown on the

5915.76 --> 5921.2390000000005
channel like

5918.679 --> 5922.719
provably that happened from one day to

5921.239 --> 5925.799999999999
the

5922.719 --> 5928.84
other it's like yeah 300 slightly

5925.8 --> 5933.679
growing every day and then it was just

5928.84 --> 5935.76
like oh now you just got one3 bang and

5933.679 --> 5939.56
it stays like that it's just not moving

5935.76 --> 5939.56
anymore right just like my

5940.239 --> 5946.5199999999995
subscribers like in this summer mycri

5943.32 --> 5950.0
subscribers basically got cut down to a

5946.52 --> 5952.92
halt I keep getting new

5950.0 --> 5954.96
subscribers and then losing subscribers

5952.92 --> 5958.4800000000005
just amount the same amount I don't even

5954.96 --> 5960.76
know who or what and so my subscriber

5958.48 --> 5962.5599999999995
amount is just stuck at this level like

5960.76 --> 5964.679
at this exact level for a half years

5962.56 --> 5966.84
it's not the first time by the way like

5964.679 --> 5968.92
four years ago that also happened it

5966.84 --> 5971.04
just kept me stuck like didn't matter

5968.92 --> 5974.719
how many new people I bumped

5971.04 --> 5974.719
into it just kept

5977.52 --> 5983.040000000001
stuck right so it's going to be stuck at

5983.32 --> 5990.04
2764

5985.76 --> 5991.719
65 it's been around that it's not gone

5990.04 --> 5994.28
away from it

5991.719 --> 5997.76
goes up and down and up and down even

5994.28 --> 5997.759999999999
though there's all kinds of new

5999.04 --> 6005.36
people and at days I got a lot of

6001.84 --> 6005.360000000001
viewers actually

6011.48 --> 6017.44
so so it's algorithmic Crackdown it's

6014.88 --> 6019.119
like it is really measurably on my

6017.44 --> 6020.96
channel and Nathan Oakley's Channel

6019.119 --> 6023.159
anybody that's directly associated with

6020.96 --> 6026.4
flatter Earth the

6023.159 --> 6030.199
baits has got this algorithmic Crackdown

6026.4 --> 6032.4
on them it's very specifically us yeah

6030.199 --> 6034.119
oh we're the special boys we're the yeah

6032.4 --> 6038.719
yeah we

6034.119 --> 6041.598999999999
are I don't care I don't like it

6038.719 --> 6043.44
particularly it might bring credit on

6041.599 --> 6046.2390000000005
the long run that's all cute yeah yeah

6043.44 --> 6048.839999999999
but we are getting very specifically us

6046.239 --> 6051.239
the algorithmic Crackdown on this yeah

6048.84 --> 6054.2390000000005
there's tons of flat earthers out there

6051.239 --> 6058.119
have absolutely no issue whatsoever with

6054.239 --> 6058.119
their streams they're not getting

6059.639 --> 6065.400000000001
gatee I am and Nathan Oakley is because

6063.56 --> 6068.96
we're very

6065.4 --> 6071.119
relevant in Flat Earth for what we do

6068.96 --> 6073.719
especially Nathan oakle

6071.119 --> 6075.679
is I mean I've kind of like sort of

6073.719 --> 6078.199
drifted out to the side but I mean my

6075.679 --> 6079.84
points are still there from all the way

6078.199 --> 6082.36
in the

6079.84 --> 6087.56
beginning we get the algorithmic

6082.36 --> 6090.08
Crackdown and people that love the fista

6087.56 --> 6092.88
nonsense they they just yeah they get

6090.08 --> 6094.88
the full the full ad the full

6092.88 --> 6098.119
advertising

6094.88 --> 6100.4400000000005
everything yeah just talk about hor [ __ ]

6098.119 --> 6104.0
and tie that in intricately with flat

6100.44 --> 6107.239
Earth the more [ __ ] your

6104.0 --> 6109.32
ideas if you can just maneuver it right

6107.239 --> 6111.199
if you like you say Flat Earth you just

6109.32 --> 6112.96
have a bunch of horeshit story St and

6111.199 --> 6116.96
just say Flat Earth in between a flat

6112.96 --> 6119.84
earth flat then you get like green light

6116.96 --> 6121.92
gates open Here Comes the Money influx

6119.84 --> 6124.56
advertisement like

6121.92 --> 6127.119
yes the more

6124.56 --> 6129.0
[ __ ] what you do is and is

6127.119 --> 6132.08
associated with flat Earth the the

6129.0 --> 6133.36
higher your promotion will be that's how

6132.08 --> 6138.5199999999995
it

6133.36 --> 6142.199
works if you're too direct too dry cut

6138.52 --> 6144.639
too to the point

6142.199 --> 6147.36
with flat Earth arguments they tell you

6144.639 --> 6149.0
to go [ __ ] yourself and if you're lucky

6147.36 --> 6151.759999999999
they don't take down your channel for

6149.0 --> 6151.76
absolutely no

6155.719 --> 6162.96
reason but if you talk absolute hor [ __ ]

6159.08 --> 6166.32
talk about ether ether ether that thing

6162.96 --> 6169.56
that complete hor [ __ ] bunch of techno

6166.32 --> 6171.28
Babble nice and confusing maybe drawing

6169.56 --> 6174.4400000000005
some stupid

6171.28 --> 6177.4
polarized political

6174.44 --> 6179.239
crap some bandwagon some political

6177.4 --> 6182.759999999999
bandwagon oh you want to draw that in

6179.239 --> 6185.199
with flat Earth yes yes like maybe like

6182.76 --> 6189.4800000000005
really unpopular

6185.199 --> 6192.4
groups right that are like Risk groups

6189.48 --> 6195.08
to the other side maybe there right it's

6192.4 --> 6198.4
like oh Flat Earth there's just anything

6195.08 --> 6200.84
that's like consider like o they're

6198.4 --> 6203.5199999999995
talking about Muslim terrorists or

6200.84 --> 6205.92
they're talking about anti-sites or this

6203.52 --> 6208.400000000001
and that well just think of like

6205.92 --> 6211.4400000000005
anything that's right in the current

6208.4 --> 6214.28
attention of what is the ultimate Evil

6211.44 --> 6218.32
to the west or whatever right well just

6214.28 --> 6220.04
take that and then like do that and just

6218.32 --> 6222.04
say Flat Earth flat earth flat earth

6220.04 --> 6224.8
flat earth right in between that and

6222.04 --> 6227.719
you'll get like the number one seat at

6224.8 --> 6231.08
the row of YouTube you'll get like the

6227.719 --> 6233.159
full gate works you'll get it all you

6231.08 --> 6237.0
get a sponsorship you'll get

6233.159 --> 6239.199
everything because you just perfectly in

6237.0 --> 6242.119
lock step with how the programs rolling

6239.199 --> 6244.638999999999
out made everything that is evil

6242.119 --> 6248.28
directly emotionally associated with

6244.639 --> 6251.36
flat Earth and that's what they want

6248.28 --> 6253.239
they want everybody to want flat

6251.36 --> 6256.199
earthers to

6253.239 --> 6261.44
die they want it to be associated with

6256.199 --> 6265.96
pure evil and hatred and sadism and VI

6261.44 --> 6268.28
ESS and death that's what they want

6265.96 --> 6271.639
everybody to think about when they hear

6268.28 --> 6274.759999999999
the word flat earth

6271.639 --> 6277.8
right that's what they want that's what

6274.76 --> 6280.1990000000005
YouTube wants that's what the globalists

6277.8 --> 6284.04
want it's what the Neo

6280.199 --> 6287.28
feudalist fascist corporatists

6284.04 --> 6291.4
want they hate Flat Earth and they want

6287.28 --> 6293.28
everyone to associate it with terrorism

6291.4 --> 6296.08
and

6293.28 --> 6299.36
Satanism and pedophilia too if they

6296.08 --> 6303.239
could if if they could get that that far

6299.36 --> 6303.239
they' want it all they hate

6306.76 --> 6314.639
it because it doesn't allow people to

6311.719 --> 6318.679
believe hor

6314.639 --> 6322.159000000001
[ __ ] and controllers want everybody to

6318.679 --> 6325.0
be comfortable believing in

6322.159 --> 6328.598999999999
Illusions because that way those

6325.0 --> 6330.88
controllers can control those people

6328.599 --> 6333.08
through their

6330.88 --> 6336.400000000001
delusions the flat

6333.08 --> 6339.36
earther kind of gets in the way of

6336.4 --> 6343.199
delusions flat earthers particularly are

6339.36 --> 6347.08
very keen on breaking

6343.199 --> 6351.08
delusions making the controllers lose

6347.08 --> 6352.44
their control over the people

6351.08 --> 6356.639
and

6352.44 --> 6359.159
thus wherever there's programming the

6356.639 --> 6361.92
programming would be made better in

6359.159 --> 6365.48
their view if flat earthers were

6361.92 --> 6367.96
associated with terrorists satanists and

6365.48 --> 6371.239
pedophiles that's what they want

6367.96 --> 6374.599
everybody to associate it with because

6371.239 --> 6375.759999999999
that way the risk of becoming awakened

6374.599 --> 6378.92
to

6375.76 --> 6381.639
manipulations for the flock of people

6378.92 --> 6384.28
becomes minimum

6381.639 --> 6384.28
it's very

6403.44 --> 6409.08
simple will you set a time for the life

6406.48 --> 6409.08
later

6409.4 --> 6413.36
no

6411.08 --> 6413.36
not

6415.199 --> 6423.239
really I mean it's just going to be in 8

6418.36 --> 6427.799999999999
hours from now just that's what it

6423.239 --> 6427.799999999999
is exactly eight hours from

6428.4 --> 6435.839999999999
now right over here it's 4:00 p.m.

6431.639 --> 6438.88
Amsterdam time then around 12 p.m. amsm

6435.84 --> 6442.32
time is when I'm going to have my New

6438.88 --> 6442.32
Year stream

6455.4 --> 6462.119
re yeah akumu

6457.76 --> 6466.84
virus yeah every little bit every

6462.119 --> 6469.598999999999
piece but I mean weed is also risky

6466.84 --> 6471.92
dude yeah I mean that streamer guy that

6469.599 --> 6474.4400000000005
I was recommend Ed yesterday then watch

6471.92 --> 6477.88
that night he's literally start I'm

6474.44 --> 6479.839999999999
smoking some weed man just smoking all

6477.88 --> 6482.4400000000005
over screen I'm like what the [ __ ] is

6479.84 --> 6482.4400000000005
wrong with you

6483.08 --> 6490.28
dude like yeah I smoke a little bit of

6486.32 --> 6493.5199999999995
Wei too before I do my shows what do I

6490.28 --> 6498.4
not do on

6493.52 --> 6501.56
screen yeah because this is not like oh

6498.4 --> 6504.5199999999995
this is the coffee shop oh just tune in

6501.56 --> 6507.280000000001
so you could get high or something and

6504.52 --> 6510.159000000001
[ __ ] no this is supposed to be

6507.28 --> 6512.88
supposed to be educational in nature and

6510.159 --> 6515.5599999999995
I don't want everybody to immediately

6512.88 --> 6519.52
think about

6515.56 --> 6519.52
drugs you shouldn't do

6520.52 --> 6526.360000000001
that technically I think it's also Haram

6524.599 --> 6528.8
it's not the right thing to do in

6526.36 --> 6530.719
accordance to Islam and I thought that

6528.8 --> 6533.56
that was like a thing

6530.719 --> 6535.52
with that guy from that channel like

6533.56 --> 6538.4400000000005
that they were like Islam understanding

6535.52 --> 6540.8
and everything but but he going to smoke

6538.44 --> 6544.28
some weed I'm smoking some weed what the

6540.8 --> 6544.28
[ __ ] is wrong with you you

6544.4 --> 6548.5599999999995
[ __ ] why the hell do you do

6548.599 --> 6557.32
that not cool not Haram I mean it is

6553.56 --> 6560.639
Haram not good right

6557.32 --> 6563.04
whatever yeah educational that's right

my channel is educational yeah it's

6563.04 --> 6569.56
classified education I'm so sorry you

6566.08 --> 6572.08
can't handle that I'm so sorry that my

6569.56 --> 6574.0
education isn't in line with your

6572.08 --> 6577.92
stupidity

6574.0 --> 6580.639
standards all the provably incorrect

6577.92 --> 6584.4
standards that are forced in education

6580.639 --> 6584.400000000001
huh yeah

6589.119 --> 6592.119
yeah

6594.0 --> 6600.36
what please fight the flare does it off

6597.4 --> 6600.36
screen what are you talking

6619.04 --> 6623.239
about

6621.159 --> 6626.719
what what is supposedly fight the flood

6623.239 --> 6628.0
Earth off screen doing what are you

6626.719 --> 6630.88
talking

6628.0 --> 6633.08
about like that's not even a a response

6630.88 --> 6635.639
to anybody talking so what the [ __ ] are

6633.08 --> 6635.639
you talking

6636.56 --> 6644.1990000000005
about does what off screen there's

6639.199 --> 6647.48
nobody saying anything for you to say

6644.199 --> 6652.32
it smoking ah okay so you're responding

6647.48 --> 6656.28
to me okay good on

6652.32 --> 6658.44
him and so do I I don't do that during

6656.28 --> 6658.44
the

6663.04 --> 6667.84
show it would just be lame

6669.56 --> 6672.56
anyway

6674.48 --> 6678.959999999999
right I didn't know he was a smoker like

6677.159 --> 6681.96
that by the

6678.96 --> 6681.96
way

6683.159 --> 6688.079
kind of weird since it is technically

6686.52 --> 6690.4800000000005
illegal in

6688.079 --> 6693.44
England I didn't think he would be

6690.48 --> 6693.44
somebody that did

6693.48 --> 6698.959999999999
that he got enough trouble with the law

6696.56 --> 6698.96
as it

6705.719 --> 6711.199
is what Craig does or not does of screen

6708.719 --> 6713.32
is irrelevant I disagree it is all

6711.199 --> 6715.839999999999
relevant all of it is relevant it's all

6713.32 --> 6717.84
a representative right what I do off

6715.84 --> 6720.8
screen is also

6717.84 --> 6724.32
relevant because what I do off screen

6720.8 --> 6727.92
influences what I am or what I am going

6724.32 --> 6731.4
to have inside of me energy wise when I

6727.92 --> 6733.76
am on screen what you do off screen is

6731.4 --> 6736.239
relevant it has an influence on what you

6733.76 --> 6736.2390000000005
do on

6738.88 --> 6741.88
screen

6748.28 --> 6753.84
although I do agree that I mean Craig

6750.199 --> 6757.28
says a lot of ridiculous

6753.84 --> 6760.1990000000005
things he's like a complete

6757.28 --> 6763.44
ass more than the average anti-at

6760.199 --> 6763.44
earther I agree to

6767.679 --> 6772.36
that hey what we gy bear get to see

6779.56 --> 6785.56
you oh my God it's such a rainy day

6782.239 --> 6788.839999999999
except it completely isn't and it's all

6785.56 --> 6791.92
dry the weather prediction is [ __ ]

6788.84 --> 6791.92
got it completely

6798.76 --> 6801.76
wrong

6830.88 --> 6835.719
right wow can't believe I'm almost going

6833.04 --> 6838.639
for two hours

6835.719 --> 6840.76
already so it was just thinking yeah

6838.639 --> 6843.639
there is there anything specific that

6840.76 --> 6843.639
like needs to be

6847.44 --> 6851.44
discussed before the end of the

6857.639 --> 6864.04
year time flies when you're yeah I'm a

6861.599 --> 6865.4800000000005
fun this is a great show don't forget to

6864.04 --> 6870.159
Rogan it

6865.48 --> 6870.159
up right don't forget the Rogan up my

6871.48 --> 6876.5199999999995
show they don't even try to be accurate

6873.92 --> 6879.599
about the weather anymore not really it

6876.52 --> 6882.599
seems woodwor anyy

6879.599 --> 6885.76
bear although I do suspect that a lot of

6882.599 --> 6888.92
it is actually just like mind control

6885.76 --> 6891.04
like what how do they you they want you

6888.92 --> 6892.52
to think about about the near future

6891.04 --> 6894.4
right because weather has an influence

6892.52 --> 6895.84
on your mood and if you think certain

6894.4 --> 6897.48
types of weather are coming that's going

6895.84 --> 6899.76
to influence what you're going to be

6897.48 --> 6902.839999999999
planning and I think they're just using

6899.76 --> 6905.320000000001
it like that like they can't actually

6902.84 --> 6908.28
accurately forecast certain things

6905.32 --> 6911.96
anymore but they will just pretend like

6908.28 --> 6914.639
they can and then try to manipulate

6911.96 --> 6916.679
people with specific forecasts that have

6914.639 --> 6919.4800000000005
absolutely no reason to be there other

6916.679 --> 6922.2390000000005
than to manipulate people's minds on how

6919.48 --> 6924.919999999999
they going to think about the near

6922.239 --> 6927.04
future I think they're just like weirdly

6924.92 --> 6930.679
social engineering manipulating people

6927.04 --> 6930.679
with this weather forecasting

6935.04 --> 6938.4
sometimes right I mean it's fairy

6936.96 --> 6940.8
telling where there's oh there's this

6938.4 --> 6943.799999999999
giant storm coming giant storm coming

6940.8 --> 6946.320000000001
and it's like it keeps coming next week

6943.8 --> 6947.76
it just moves with you next never comes

6946.32 --> 6948.88
well you're going to be anticipating

6947.76 --> 6950.4400000000005
that storm you're going to be thinking

6948.88 --> 6952.84
oh there the storm coming there's a

6950.44 --> 6955.199
storm coming well maybe that's what they

6952.84 --> 6958.04
wanted they want everybody to feel like

6955.199 --> 6959.638999999999
that for some reason not that any storm

6958.04 --> 6962.639
was ever

6959.639 --> 6962.639
coming

6975.28 --> 6979.32
see all right but there certainly

6977.639 --> 6981.56
doesn't seem to be storm coming right

6979.32 --> 6984.88
now even though it's supposedly raiding

6981.56 --> 6986.639
all day long yeah no it isn't at all not

6984.88 --> 6989.400000000001
a

6986.639 --> 6991.88
drop maybe a bit later that might be

6989.4 --> 6994.719
some but I mean it doesn't look like

6991.88 --> 6998.52
that's going to be a lot

6994.719 --> 6998.52
anyway hey slow-mo moon

7000.679 --> 7007.599
buggy oh is that still that offer still

7004.04 --> 7007.599
up slow-mo that's

7008.48 --> 7011.48
cool

7023.679 --> 7027.28
yeah is it still

7033.32 --> 7038.079
up

7035.32 --> 7041.4
whatever if it is still there this is

7038.079 --> 7041.4
where you can get it

7057.36 --> 7061.48
Missouri loves company that's

7068.4 --> 7071.4
hilarious

7098.32 --> 7101.32
h

7128.32 --> 7131.32
for

7158.239 --> 7161.239
h

7172.159 --> 7174.5199999999995
right

7188.239 --> 7191.239
anyway

7218.159 --> 7228.0
I'm feeling the

7220.8 --> 7228.0
de find a young buck the deed an

7234.56 --> 7239.400000000001
okay

7236.4 --> 7239.4
dear

7240.88 --> 7245.96
wow

7243.239 --> 7248.119
huh that sound that sounds very

7245.96 --> 7251.119
interesting

7248.119 --> 7251.119
slowmo

7253.639 --> 7261.96
did you and did you or are you going to

7258.199 --> 7264.4
make predictions for 2024 did I miss it

7261.96 --> 7267.88
uh no I haven't really made any

7264.4 --> 7270.239
predictions for real I

7267.88 --> 7272.639
mean I think it's just mostly just going

7270.239 --> 7275.638999999999
to be a continuation of this

7272.639 --> 7279.1990000000005
year and this year is really

7275.639 --> 7281.1990000000005
when the big transition would happen

7279.199 --> 7283.839999999999
when it's like the full coming out and

7281.199 --> 7286.4
like the darkness is really showing its

7283.84 --> 7289.96
face that happened this year it's also

7286.4 --> 7294.719
the start of the their response to

7289.96 --> 7294.719
that the unification of the

7295.679 --> 7302.36
resistance

7298.239 --> 7306.079
and both will continue their

7302.36 --> 7306.079
strides in the next

7307.599 --> 7313.04
year but is also going to be a year

7310.04 --> 7315.96
where just like it's going to be more

7313.04 --> 7318.32
apparent how this supposed group type of

7315.96 --> 7321.0
political organization that's out there

7318.32 --> 7323.32
things like NATO and World Health

7321.0 --> 7326.56
Organization all those big

7323.32 --> 7330.079
things they're all going to be revealed

7326.56 --> 7331.400000000001
to like not be exactly what everybody

7330.079 --> 7332.92
thought they

7331.4 --> 7336.36
were

7332.92 --> 7338.52
like their cohesion is disintegrating

7336.36 --> 7340.5599999999995
the organizations are not working

7338.52 --> 7343.280000000001
anymore

7340.56 --> 7347.4800000000005
like the UN and everything all those big

7343.28 --> 7347.48
things like they're all going to be

7352.0 --> 7355.8
like why would you say

7356.239 --> 7361.638999999999
that how would you say that like slowly

7359.84 --> 7364.76
getting

7361.639 --> 7367.4800000000005
detached like they're they're still all

7364.76 --> 7369.280000000001
in our society integrated in our society

7367.48 --> 7373.239
they've all given us mess massive

7369.28 --> 7374.5599999999995
detriments in the last few years we know

7373.239 --> 7375.959999999999
that now and they're not going to be

7374.56 --> 7378.719
stopping so what's going to happen

7375.96 --> 7381.679
instead is like they're literally going

7378.719 --> 7384.599
to be pushed out of

7381.679 --> 7386.639
society it's like yeah oh World Health

7384.599 --> 7388.56
yeah yeah we don't recognize you anymore

7386.639 --> 7391.88
oh this and that yeah we don't recognize

7388.56 --> 7394.56
you yeah you're all illegal here like

7391.88 --> 7397.88
you no longer can do business

7394.56 --> 7402.8
here like that's going to be a

7397.88 --> 7402.8
thing 2024 that's what I'm

7403.8 --> 7407.92
predicting all these globalist

7405.84 --> 7409.1990000000005
organizations are going to be like

7407.92 --> 7411.719
sweated

7409.199 --> 7414.239
out like in a

7411.719 --> 7416.639
fever where they were before fully

7414.239 --> 7418.799999999999
integrated all prepared and all stocked

7416.639 --> 7420.96
up and they got everything they need and

7418.8 --> 7423.639
but they're discovered now and now the

7420.96 --> 7428.119
immune system is basically starting to

7423.639 --> 7431.84
get active to try to like eject the

7428.119 --> 7435.44
foreign body which is now finally been

7431.84 --> 7438.32
identified as a foreign body to the body

7435.44 --> 7443.159
and it's being worked

7438.32 --> 7443.159
on so that means inflammation

7443.4 --> 7449.719
effectively right it's been identified

7447.159 --> 7452.4
but it's been integrated in the body for

7449.719 --> 7453.52
a long time this parasite has been

7452.4 --> 7455.558999999999
growing

7453.52 --> 7457.8
slowly and

7455.559 --> 7460.52
detected it has

7457.8 --> 7462.0
influence but I mean once the immune

7460.52 --> 7463.88
system kicks in it can have all the

7462.0 --> 7467.119
infuence you like it'll just get

7463.88 --> 7467.119
separate it will just

7467.559 --> 7473.88
like what the hell is the word that I'm

7470.44 --> 7473.879999999999
looking for damn

7476.32 --> 7480.599
it n i

7485.599 --> 7490.76
hatte hey nay nay

7495.119 --> 7501.759999999999
nay oh wow okay loosen I guess that's

7499.36 --> 7506.199
just

7501.76 --> 7507.2390000000005
it discorporate loosen it's just that

7506.199 --> 7509.759999999999
it's

7507.239 --> 7513.079
loosen you could even compare it to like

7509.76 --> 7514.320000000001
a dead tooth right it'll just sit there

7513.079 --> 7516.599
but

7514.32 --> 7518.96
eventually it's going to start loosening

7516.599 --> 7524.04
it's going to start to eject itself

7518.96 --> 7526.36
because it's no longer integrated it's

7524.04 --> 7528.8
dead and that's what I feel is going to

7526.36 --> 7531.4
happen to all these Mega organizations

7528.8 --> 7533.559
like the UN related stuff and even NATO

7531.4 --> 7536.04
and all of this

7533.559 --> 7539.76
crap is

7536.04 --> 7543.239
detected and it's like it's no longer

7539.76 --> 7546.52
considered as a Unity now with the whole

7543.239 --> 7548.879999999999
and so it's going to gradually

7546.52 --> 7552.159000000001
loosen and eventually completely

7548.88 --> 7554.92
separate and then we will know like yeah

7552.159 --> 7559.44
we are all we got all those

7554.92 --> 7559.4400000000005
organizations are all there against

7559.559 --> 7566.52
us whatever any original intentions were

7562.96 --> 7570.559
they're all occupied by people that only

7566.52 --> 7574.679
seems to have vested vested interest in

7570.559 --> 7574.679
reducing world population and mind

7574.96 --> 7580.44
control and that's going to be more and

7577.239 --> 7583.44
more pronounced and it's going to be

7580.44 --> 7585.32
separated from the actual people they

7583.44 --> 7587.0
are just all going to be like yeah we're

7585.32 --> 7589.599
not going to do

7587.0 --> 7591.559
that we don't want to be part of that

7589.599 --> 7594.52
and also like even the promises and the

7591.559 --> 7596.52
money promises that they get to give

7594.52 --> 7598.639
right which is how they always get

7596.52 --> 7601.52
people corrupted with just lots of money

7598.639 --> 7603.28
like unlimited fiat currency through the

7601.52 --> 7604.92
World Bank or

7603.28 --> 7607.96
something

7604.92 --> 7611.4
like it's not going to work anymore

7607.96 --> 7614.4
because their promissary

7611.4 --> 7615.799999999999
notes are just like not going to be

7614.4 --> 7618.48
effective

7615.8 --> 7620.28
like yeah oh oh you can get all the

7618.48 --> 7622.959999999999
money in the world yeah well what good

7620.28 --> 7627.4
is that when you can't buy anything with

7622.96 --> 7630.559
it see that's the direction I'm thinking

7627.4 --> 7632.558999999999
at like oh yeah we'll just start a new

7630.559 --> 7634.52
yeah oh really who are you going to

7632.559 --> 7637.52
bribe with

7634.52 --> 7640.4800000000005
what it's not going to work anymore it

7637.52 --> 7643.400000000001
doesn't work anymore that entire

7640.48 --> 7645.959999999999
parasitical type system that relies upon

7643.4 --> 7647.759999999999
having large amount of wealth to Bright

7645.96 --> 7651.96
people to fall for your

7647.76 --> 7657.360000000001
schemes yeah it's going to stop

7651.96 --> 7657.36
working entirely on a grand

7665.28 --> 7670.04
scale so that's what I predict for 2024

7669.0 --> 7671.639
at least we're going to see the

7670.04 --> 7676.719
beginning of

7671.639 --> 7679.079
that yeah it's public Consciousness

7676.719 --> 7681.8
where before there was the individual

7679.079 --> 7685.0
Awakening right awaken from the

7681.8 --> 7686.88
collective like oh my God it's all wrong

7685.0 --> 7689.04
and we're like we're responding and then

7686.88 --> 7690.599
we're like we're trying to find as

7689.04 --> 7692.92
individuals we have been doing this for

7690.599 --> 7695.079
year what's the proper way of thinking

7692.92 --> 7697.52
about how do we respond how do we really

7695.079 --> 7700.119
want to be as humans how do we want

7697.52 --> 7702.96
others to be and then like try to create

7700.119 --> 7704.48
micr culture within ourselves and then

7702.96 --> 7706.599
eventually it's like oh yeah you're kind

7704.48 --> 7708.48
of like us okay then we're kind of on

7706.599 --> 7710.76
the same side we have differences but

7708.48 --> 7713.759999999999
we're like on the same side that has

7710.76 --> 7713.76
formed now and

7714.679 --> 7725.32
now that grass rooted individual created

7720.84 --> 7727.400000000001
counterculture will start to replace it

7725.32 --> 7732.719
will gain its

7727.4 --> 7736.4
own standardized track its own autopilot

7732.719 --> 7739.079
system from within that perspective that

7736.4 --> 7742.48
can replace the

7739.079 --> 7746.239
old automated system that has been so

7742.48 --> 7748.839999999999
thoroughly corrupted right that auto

7746.239 --> 7750.799999999999
system that we all had to step away from

7748.84 --> 7753.719
can be replaced because we have

7750.8 --> 7757.639
something to replace it with a new

7753.719 --> 7758.84
automated way of doing things based on

7757.639 --> 7762.1990000000005
our new

7758.84 --> 7764.719
found principles that oppose the old

7762.199 --> 7767.48
system principles that created all those

7764.719 --> 7770.8
problems in the autopilot system that

7767.48 --> 7771.839999999999
you can follow with your mind yeah and

7770.8 --> 7775.52
that's going

7771.84 --> 7777.84
to it's like the conspiracy thing is

7775.52 --> 7779.84
going to replace the old

7777.84 --> 7781.32
Paradigm it's no longer going to be

7779.84 --> 7783.719
conspiracy it's just like yeah now it's

7781.32 --> 7787.36
just yeah this just what it

7783.719 --> 7789.719
is and instead of fake oh white

7787.36 --> 7791.5199999999995
supremacist not see enemies that are

7789.719 --> 7792.96
continually being whed about you're just

7791.52 --> 7796.1990000000005
going to be like yeah there's this

7792.96 --> 7798.199
really freaky antihuman old rich people

7796.199 --> 7800.48
that are crazy and have too much money

7798.199 --> 7802.0
and they mind control everyone like

7800.48 --> 7805.28
that's just going to be the normal there

7802.0 --> 7808.199
no more fake stupid white supremacist

7805.28 --> 7810.96
Nazis oh so dangerous like that's going

7808.199 --> 7810.96
to then just

7813.239 --> 7820.239
stop nobody's going to buy that anymore

7816.04 --> 7820.239
it's just agitating

7822.159 --> 7827.36
right so yeah plenty is going to happen

7825.079 --> 7829.679
transformation that's already underway

7827.36 --> 7832.48
worldwide with people's Consciousness

7829.679 --> 7835.36
and Spirits is going to continue it's

7832.48 --> 7837.718999999999
basically kind of like the

7835.36 --> 7842.44
start and there's going to be more

7837.719 --> 7845.44
damage to us more risk yeah fire all day

7842.44 --> 7849.799999999999
long lva po all day long from beginning

7845.44 --> 7851.719
to end and tomorrow still yes I don't

7849.8 --> 7854.4400000000005
want to keep saying it every day though

7851.719 --> 7855.76
yes fir works all day long it's every

7854.44 --> 7859.32
year like

7855.76 --> 7861.4800000000005
that I'm surprised it didn't start being

7859.32 --> 7862.96
like that a week ago it only started

7861.48 --> 7867.239
like

7862.96 --> 7871.32
yesterday where it's really all day

7867.239 --> 7875.598999999999
long I mean 4 years ago it was like an

7871.32 --> 7877.159
entire month of that every day not so

7875.599 --> 7880.28
much

7877.159 --> 7883.28
I but still

7880.28 --> 7883.28
plenty

7888.239 --> 7894.959999999999
uh right so

7891.4 --> 7898.48
Consciousness migration of the

7894.96 --> 7900.599
masses when enough awakened people to

7898.48 --> 7903.119
the old globalist system and their mind

7900.599 --> 7907.0
control Marxist mind control once enough

7903.119 --> 7909.199
of that forms then they form their own

7907.0 --> 7912.04
autopilot system

7909.199 --> 7915.919999999999
system and if that autopilot system is

7912.04 --> 7921.32
dynamic enough then that can

7915.92 --> 7923.159
be taken by all the people the people

7921.32 --> 7925.159
that are normally latched onto the

7923.159 --> 7927.239
default system that is presented to them

7925.159 --> 7928.839999999999
by government and all that they will

7927.239 --> 7933.159
have no

7928.84 --> 7934.76
problem next year to just like okay

7933.159 --> 7936.44
we're done with that system it doesn't

7934.76 --> 7939.639
work anymore we're going to go to this

7936.44 --> 7943.04
new system yeah it wasn't given to us by

7939.639 --> 7944.36
government but they don't give us

7943.04 --> 7947.04
anything that

7944.36 --> 7949.119
works so we're just going to take this

7947.04 --> 7951.679
other way of doing it and thinking about

7949.119 --> 7951.679
it

7952.04 --> 7957.32
now and then try to work through the

7954.599 --> 7958.679
Feast of nonsense that's woven into that

7957.32 --> 7961.119
they have to figure it out for

7958.679 --> 7963.76
themselves or just become stupid parrots

7961.119 --> 7965.48
that that repeat talking points that

7963.76 --> 7967.52
they don't really understand or really

7965.48 --> 7970.678999999999
know where it came from cuz that's going

7967.52 --> 7970.679
to happen to too of

7974.04 --> 7981.8
course what is bitcoin's

7977.599 --> 7985.079
value it's like where is it 30

7981.8 --> 7985.079000000001
40 let's

7987.719 --> 7991.28
see yeah it's at

7993.119 --> 7999.96
38,000

7994.8 --> 7999.96
38.6 th000 right now Bitcoin

8001.96 --> 8004.96
so yeah not

8017.559 --> 8022.4800000000005
bad right I'm going to take a two-minute

8019.84 --> 8025.28
break and I'll be right back it's

8022.48 --> 8025.28
getting dark in

8026.96 --> 8033.4
here

8029.36 --> 8033.4
all right be right

8056.88 --> 8059.88
back

8086.88 --> 8089.88
for

8116.8 --> 8119.8
for

8147.36 --> 8149.799999999999
all right

8151.96 --> 8157.679
it's getting all

8154.32 --> 8160.84
dark it's getting all dark in

8157.679 --> 8165.119
here I don't even know what I'm talking

8160.84 --> 8167.4800000000005
about what accent is this is this Indian

8165.119 --> 8167.48
I don't

8169.599 --> 8175.079
know hey teret wow it's like I could

8172.8 --> 8177.119000000001
smell you or something I was doing an

8175.079 --> 8180.0
Indian accent even before I saw you in

8177.119 --> 8180.0
chat there that was

8181.36 --> 8186.32
weird

8183.719 --> 8192.439
sorry anyway good to see

8186.32 --> 8195.599
you what is h wga here we go again is

8192.439 --> 8195.599
what that is

8206.679 --> 8209.679
yeah

8220.76 --> 8227.319
Bitcoin is worth something because you

8222.399 --> 8231.119999999999
have to expand expend energy to mine it

8227.319 --> 8235.119999999999
no technically why Bitcoin is worth so

8231.12 --> 8240.08
much is because it's a very specific

8235.12 --> 8242.160000000002
amount of it that can

8240.08 --> 8246.16
exist it's

8242.16 --> 8249.519
a super specific limited resource and

8246.16 --> 8251.96
it's the limited nature of the resource

8249.519 --> 8253.960000000001
of Bitcoin that gives it its

8251.96 --> 8258.759999999998
value

8253.96 --> 8261.358999999999
because you will forever know exactly

8258.76 --> 8264.28
how much of there exists right there's

8261.359 --> 8266.599
nothing else in this world for for which

8264.28 --> 8269.359
you can say that like

8266.599 --> 8271.04
gold you don't know exactly how much

8269.359 --> 8272.880000000001
gold there is there might be more gold

8271.04 --> 8276.2
over sudden somebody might bump into a

8272.88 --> 8278.759999999998
pocket somewhere in the earth and like

8276.2 --> 8281.880000000001
giant amounts of it can change we don't

8278.76 --> 8286.359
know how much of there is there

8281.88 --> 8292.0
Bitcoin is very specific of how much of

8286.359 --> 8292.0
there can exist and that is what they

8293.08 --> 8298.439
use that

8295.12 --> 8302.2
specificity about the quantity

8298.439 --> 8305.08
that's how they use it that is the the

8302.2 --> 8308.679
ultimate absolute stability about it

8305.08 --> 8312.639
that they're using as a foundation of

8308.679 --> 8315.16
value it's the absolute limitation that

8312.639 --> 8318.119999999999
is the

8315.16 --> 8321.24
value it's not how much energy you

8318.12 --> 8323.479000000001
wasted trying to make it once it's made

8321.24 --> 8323.479
it's

8326.519 --> 8329.519
made

8330.16 --> 8334.76
a limited Supply is only valuable if

8332.479 --> 8338.639
it's useful

8334.76 --> 8338.639000000001
yeah just like fiat

8345.28 --> 8350.16
currency it's I mean we're using fiat

8347.679 --> 8352.0
currency right does it have inherent

8350.16 --> 8356.439
value no it's

8352.0 --> 8361.639
debt still using it though seems to be

8356.439 --> 8364.0
working and yeah I mean it's valuable

8361.639 --> 8367.399
because people will decide it is

8364.0 --> 8368.76
valuable based on the knowledge that it

8367.399 --> 8373.92
will

8368.76 --> 8373.92
be very specific how much of there will

8375.08 --> 8379.76
exist so that you can never be cheated

8377.599 --> 8382.679
with like oh yeah I had this missing

8379.76 --> 8385.84
thousand Bitcoin here like we never knew

8382.679 --> 8388.399
exist no no it would have to be known to

8385.84 --> 8391.359
exist somewhere

8388.399 --> 8395.039999999999
because you can't have an unexpected

8391.359 --> 8398.439
surplus of this and that is the value

8395.04 --> 8398.439
that is trusted upon about

8402.08 --> 8407.0
it

8404.12 --> 8409.240000000002
right digital gold no it's not like

8407.0 --> 8411.96
digital gold at all I mean gold is

8409.24 --> 8416.039999999999
valuable because of what you can do with

8411.96 --> 8418.56
it and that it is relatively rare but

8416.04 --> 8420.720000000001
especially what you can do with it

8418.56 --> 8423.359
you can do absolutely nothing with

8420.72 --> 8427.358999999999
Bitcoin there's nothing you can do with

8423.359 --> 8430.68
it except shove it around in Virtual

8427.359 --> 8432.52
space and waste energy on it that's it

8430.68 --> 8436.76
that's all you can do with

8432.52 --> 8439.04
Bitcoin gold is industrially usable very

8436.76 --> 8439.04
much

8439.359 --> 8448.479000000001
so it has inherent value Bitcoin does

8443.399 --> 8451.68
not it only will have value based on on

8448.479 --> 8451.679999999998
agreements about its

8452.52 --> 8459.2
value in other words the banks will

8455.359 --> 8459.2
determine what the value

8460.04 --> 8465.640000000001
is and that is what it always has been

8463.04 --> 8468.52
Bank determines the

8465.64 --> 8469.92
value yeah Bitcoin is their thing

8468.52 --> 8471.6
everybody thinks oh Bitcoin

8469.92 --> 8475.56
decentralized they can't have this in

8471.6 --> 8478.880000000001
their pockets now this is the next level

8475.56 --> 8480.68
Pockets Bitcoin is is the next level

8478.88 --> 8483.24
fiat

8480.68 --> 8486.84
currency just because there's a specific

8483.24 --> 8489.84
limited amount of it does it mean is not

8486.84 --> 8492.479
fully under their control yeah it's the

8489.84 --> 8496.359
oppos it's like virtually the opposite

8492.479 --> 8500.88
of fiat currency but it's fully in their

8496.359 --> 8503.720000000001
control you see they can just say

8500.88 --> 8506.24
oh yeah you you can't use

8503.72 --> 8509.24
it and then you can't use

8506.24 --> 8509.24
it

8512.28 --> 8516.84
yeah so for Bank just says like yeah we

8515.319 --> 8519.8
don't accept Bitcoin what what you going

8516.84 --> 8523.0
to do you have to accept my bit no no

8519.8 --> 8526.119999999999
they don't they determine if they can

8523.0 --> 8532.2
accept your Bitcoin or not you don't get

8526.12 --> 8534.399000000001
a say in that yeah it's theirs not yours

8532.2 --> 8539.04
you're out for the value and the Bitcoin

8534.399 --> 8542.08
is merely an in between current ccy as a

8539.04 --> 8546.52
means to an end for you as a Bitcoin

8542.08 --> 8549.0
user yeah it's in their hands it's their

8546.52 --> 8552.2
power Bitcoin is the

8549.0 --> 8554.56
banks they just propagandize to make

8552.2 --> 8557.12
everybody think like it's the special

8554.56 --> 8560.039999999999
thing that gets you away from the banks

8557.12 --> 8561.880000000001
when it does exactly the opposite what

8560.04 --> 8564.479000000001
are you going to do with the Bitcoin

8561.88 --> 8564.479
absolutely

8564.72 --> 8571.88
nothing you're just gonna sit on it and

8567.72 --> 8575.599999999999
then maybe when you want to liquefy it

8571.88 --> 8579.199999999999
sell it for

8575.6 --> 8582.479000000001
currency where do you get currency

8579.2 --> 8587.6
Banks what do you need for that you need

8582.479 --> 8590.679999999998
them to accept your Bitcoin for currency

8587.6 --> 8592.24
which they can decline if they [ __ ]

8590.68 --> 8595.24
feel like

8592.24 --> 8595.24
it

8596.08 --> 8599.08
yeah

8611.92 --> 8615.439
whoa so

8626.08 --> 8629.08
yeah

8640.68 --> 8644.68
oh they're all loading up offer beats

8642.96 --> 8646.358999999999
yeah because there's countries that are

8644.68 --> 8649.04
going with it yeah El

8646.359 --> 8653.92
Salvador has made like Bitcoin their

8649.04 --> 8653.92
standard currency that just recently

8654.279 --> 8659.0
happened [ __ ] sake

8660.399 --> 8664.08
so yeah there's Bitcoin stuff happening

8662.8 --> 8667.479
but you have to

8664.08 --> 8667.479
realize it's the

8669.279 --> 8675.08
banks it's it's just the

8672.92 --> 8677.2
next

8675.08 --> 8680.68
Evolution

8677.2 --> 8684.399000000001
Beyond fiat currency that's all it is

8680.68 --> 8685.960000000001
guys it's just the next fiat currency

8684.399 --> 8688.96
and it's the

8685.96 --> 8688.96
banks

8703.31 --> 8706.41
[Music]

8711.479 --> 8715.0
your money is

8713.439 --> 8718.960000000001
untangles

8715.0 --> 8721.8
yeah I mean doesn't matter what happens

8718.96 --> 8723.199999999999
like with digital currency or Fiat money

8721.8 --> 8728.319
or something

8723.2 --> 8730.560000000001
new I mean a gold or silver coin is

8728.319 --> 8733.84
always going to be

8730.56 --> 8733.84
valuable like

8735.76 --> 8743.64
always so like it's maybe not be like

8741.12 --> 8746.960000000001
stable enough to like standardize the

8743.64 --> 8748.599999999999
currency based on that again although

8746.96 --> 8751.119999999999
there's countries that are going to do

8748.6 --> 8753.6
that I guarantee it like Russia is has

8751.12 --> 8755.76
so much gold they are going to have a

8753.6 --> 8758.92
gold back currency in the

8755.76 --> 8761.800000000001
future if not already like they will do

8758.92 --> 8764.16
that that's their plan and so will China

8761.8 --> 8767.199999999999
I think I'm not sure though but Russia

8764.16 --> 8768.68
definitely right that that's happening

8767.2 --> 8771.640000000001
right and who knows where that's going

8768.68 --> 8775.800000000001
to go right I mean what if you actually

8771.64 --> 8779.68
had gold backed

8775.8 --> 8781.88
crypto yeah next level Fiat instead of

8779.68 --> 8783.399
just a bunch of paper it's

8781.88 --> 8788.0
digital

8783.399 --> 8790.8
paper but it is still

8788.0 --> 8793.359
like resource

8790.8 --> 8796.08
backed that would be kind of interesting

8793.359 --> 8798.84
wouldn't it if they did that that would

8796.08 --> 8801.24
make it very

8798.84 --> 8803.56
interesting yeah instead of just oh it's

8801.24 --> 8805.039999999999
just this death care currency that's

8803.56 --> 8806.92
just like oh yeah we're going to

8805.04 --> 8809.359
determine exactly what you can buy and

8806.92 --> 8812.12
sell and there's absolutely no benefit

8809.359 --> 8816.479000000001
instead of that kind of crap there could

8812.12 --> 8818.560000000001
be a resource backed even gold backed

8816.479 --> 8820.599999999999
cryptocurrency that's just like yeah

8818.56 --> 8824.88
it's exactly like Fiat except it's

8820.6 --> 8830.2
mostly digital and it's super reliable

8824.88 --> 8830.199999999999
because like it actually is backed again

8830.279 --> 8835.720000000001
like stepping away from the fiat

8833.08 --> 8838.72
currency of unlimited

8835.72 --> 8838.72
debt

8841.0 --> 8848.24
so yeah that that might happen right I

8844.56 --> 8852.0
mean a thing that could happen 2024 is

8848.24 --> 8854.279
like the real manifestation of the

8852.0 --> 8856.2
bricks like it's really going to be more

8854.279 --> 8857.800000000001
Pro like they're already working with it

8856.2 --> 8859.399000000001
and all that and it's already kind of

8857.8 --> 8860.96
happening but it like it could like

8859.399 --> 8863.278999999999
really get

8860.96 --> 8867.0
momentum next

8863.279 --> 8869.16
year and it would probably definitely

8867.0 --> 8871.56
happen with like the fall of the dollar

8869.16 --> 8873.16
if the Dollar's like going to finally

8871.56 --> 8876.199999999999
totally

8873.16 --> 8878.96
collapse with the black SW event oh it's

8876.2 --> 8880.84
so unexpected except it's absolutely not

8878.96 --> 8884.72
unexpected at

8880.84 --> 8887.68
all it's bizarre that it hasn't happened

8884.72 --> 8891.16
yet well then if that collapses then it

8887.68 --> 8893.76
will be like the giant takeover of the

8891.16 --> 8895.64
bricks currency system and however

8893.76 --> 8899.439
that's going to

8895.64 --> 8902.92
manifest right so we could basically see

8899.439 --> 8906.439
like the complete rearranging of the

8902.92 --> 8908.359
World by the way if that happens Wars

8906.439 --> 8912.52
will

8908.359 --> 8915.479000000001
happen not like huge countries getting

8912.52 --> 8917.439
like conquered or anything but smaller

8915.479 --> 8919.679999999998
things smaller Wars yeah they will all

8917.439 --> 8922.279
start

8919.68 --> 8927.08
rolling so in that sense if America

8922.279 --> 8928.800000000001
Falls like it's not uncommon to predict

8927.08 --> 8933.279
like taiwan's going to

8928.8 --> 8937.039999999999
be conquered by China if that happens

8933.279 --> 8940.16
right and these are not difficult

8937.04 --> 8942.2
predictions so that's that is probably

8940.16 --> 8947.56
going to happen like all of these things

8942.2 --> 8947.560000000001
it's just click and everything is

8950.319 --> 8955.88
different I mean it's going to be kind

8952.399 --> 8958.84
of surreal for especially Europe but

8955.88 --> 8960.839999999998
even more America itself that just like

8958.84 --> 8964.64
yeah you're not the dominant power

8960.84 --> 8967.0
anymore like what is this world no

8964.64 --> 8969.64
American has grown up in an America

8967.0 --> 8972.68
where they weren't the dominant power

8969.64 --> 8974.119999999999
like you want to really know what to do

8972.68 --> 8978.16
with

8974.12 --> 8982.04
it like who are you now that that's

8978.16 --> 8985.119999999999
changed nobody knows it's an identity

8982.04 --> 8987.92
you're going to have to attain as it

8985.12 --> 8989.880000000001
happens nobody can tell ahead of time

8987.92 --> 8993.399
where that's going to

8989.88 --> 8994.72
end what the real new identity will be

8993.399 --> 8999.199999999999
of

8994.72 --> 8999.199999999999
Americans after the big

9000.439 --> 9004.439
change right there's going to be

9002.56 --> 9006.119999999999
Americans that are just going to pretend

9004.439 --> 9007.880000000001
like oh we're still the best we're still

9006.12 --> 9010.92
the biggest oh we're still the dominant

9007.88 --> 9013.92
like yeah no but you're not though but

9010.92 --> 9018.439
you can think of it as if you were and

9013.92 --> 9018.439
you probably will but you're Pro

9022.64 --> 9026.358999999999
not right so that could

9040.399 --> 9045.439
happen what are the odds of War on North

9043.399 --> 9046.96
American soil when power

9045.439 --> 9049.399
shifts

9046.96 --> 9051.88
extremely

9049.399 --> 9054.96
little like if you're talking about a

9051.88 --> 9058.88
war with a foreign country the chances

9054.96 --> 9061.759999999998
of like a military

9058.88 --> 9064.92
conquering a military like soldiers

9061.76 --> 9068.76
arriving at your soil and then taking it

9064.92 --> 9071.84
is like extremely

9068.76 --> 9075.319
low let's just say if that happens it

9071.84 --> 9077.479
will be received with great joy because

9075.319 --> 9081.08
it's probably on invite like could you

9077.479 --> 9083.92
please help us take over like that could

9081.08 --> 9086.8
happen but it won't be next year if that

9083.92 --> 9086.8
happens that will be

9087.24 --> 9092.479
later but what is definitely going to

9090.52 --> 9096.800000000001
happen

9092.479 --> 9099.88
is the whole new figure configuring of

9096.8 --> 9104.96
like what is America right now because

9099.88 --> 9107.599999999999
you've just had the largest amount of

9104.96 --> 9111.278999999999
immigrant influx

9107.6 --> 9114.439
that has ever happened in world

9111.279 --> 9118.0
history yeah you've had the most amount

9114.439 --> 9122.56
of people displaced in a short amount of

9118.0 --> 9126.2
time over National borders that has ever

9122.56 --> 9130.278999999999
happened in the history of the

9126.2 --> 9133.12
world yeah when those kinds of things

9130.279 --> 9135.720000000001
happen you don't you can never really

9133.12 --> 9137.12
tell what's going to come next because

9135.72 --> 9139.519999999999
it changed

9137.12 --> 9142.12
everything America is not going to be

9139.52 --> 9145.439
the country that you remember like

9142.12 --> 9148.720000000001
absolutely not there's no way and it

9145.439 --> 9153.0
could turn into a massive Civil War it

9148.72 --> 9153.0
probably in certain places

9153.12 --> 9161.160000000002
will but the American that you knew

9156.279 --> 9161.16
that's over and I'm not happy about

9165.24 --> 9168.24
that

9171.76 --> 9175.800000000001
I'm not happy about that at all I mean

9173.319 --> 9177.479
it's like the biggest treachery the

9175.8 --> 9180.64
country's ever

9177.479 --> 9182.56
seen like the government people in power

9180.64 --> 9185.119999999999
right now that are responsible for this

9182.56 --> 9189.479
should all get the death penalty all of

9185.12 --> 9189.479000000001
them like straight on death

9190.56 --> 9196.439
penalty no life and death penalty but

9194.56 --> 9199.76
what they've done they like destroyed

9196.439 --> 9199.76
the entire cohesion of the

9200.319 --> 9205.319
country by doing all

9203.319 --> 9207.76
this like

9205.319 --> 9210.278999999999
organizing that influx yeah those

9207.76 --> 9213.960000000001
amounts of people that's

9210.279 --> 9218.24
organized that much that amount of

9213.96 --> 9220.278999999999
people never just by happenstance or

9218.24 --> 9223.119999999999
circumstantiality come together to do

9220.279 --> 9224.319000000001
that that was organized all of it it's

9223.12 --> 9227.439
an

9224.319 --> 9230.8
organized total over throw of the

9227.439 --> 9230.800000000001
natural order of the

9231.76 --> 9238.12
nation effectively treason of the very

9235.439 --> 9238.12
highest

9238.439 --> 9245.439
standards and death penalty should be

9241.319 --> 9245.439
the only proper

9255.08 --> 9258.08
response

9274.479 --> 9279.438999999998
yes of course woodor and guny bear hey

9277.12 --> 9281.240000000002
and hey if it gets bad enough dude

9279.439 --> 9283.319
you'll just freaking hold the lines I

9281.24 --> 9284.76
mean if it's going to be bad enough and

9283.319 --> 9286.72
there's going to be like hundreds of

9284.76 --> 9289.0
thousands of migrants like much deeper

9286.72 --> 9291.199999999999
Inland like yeah we're going to overtake

9289.0 --> 9293.84
this Village yeah well then Village is

9291.2 --> 9297.439
going to literally just like okay well

9293.84 --> 9299.399
then we will literally kill every person

9297.439 --> 9301.359
that we see coming walking towards us

9299.399 --> 9305.68
from the Horizon like every single one

9301.359 --> 9308.359
will die and they will kill

9305.68 --> 9311.880000000001
them

9308.359 --> 9315.6
like I mean this is full Civil War

9311.88 --> 9318.72
crap that's going to happen like I mean

9315.6 --> 9320.880000000001
even the stupid pre-programming horeshit

9318.72 --> 9323.599999999999
series and movies on Netflix are not

9320.88 --> 9323.599999999999
going to do it

9330.88 --> 9336.64
justice and quite frankly by the end of

9334.8 --> 9339.24
2024 I'd

9336.64 --> 9342.64
be highly

9339.24 --> 9344.96
surprised if there haven't been like

9342.64 --> 9350.72
millions of

9344.96 --> 9350.72
dead from the ensuing Civil War by that

9354.24 --> 9359.479
time that you're going to have like

9356.279 --> 9359.479000000001
fields of dead

9359.6 --> 9363.0
bodies mostly

9369.08 --> 9374.439
immigrants right but I mean hey at least

9371.64 --> 9378.319
you got the supplies of FEMA cofins in

9374.439 --> 9380.84
for like 20 years or already so if that

9378.319 --> 9382.68
happens you will be able to take care of

9380.84 --> 9385.72
it and then everybody in the world be

9382.68 --> 9388.880000000001
like oh my God the mean

9385.72 --> 9391.438999999998
America so mean you're evil they were

9388.88 --> 9393.599999999999
the Nazis they killed all the foreigners

9391.439 --> 9397.12
yeah that literally were sent there to

9393.6 --> 9401.12
conquer the [ __ ] Nation

9397.12 --> 9404.52
yeah and I dude I really hope America

9401.12 --> 9407.2
just hardens up and says hey world go

9404.52 --> 9410.6
[ __ ] yourself yeah we

9407.2 --> 9413.12
America yeah you want to invade us for

9410.6 --> 9416.16
any reason yeah you

9413.12 --> 9419.0
die I want America to do that and I want

9416.16 --> 9421.24
them to stop being [ __ ] weeny

9419.0 --> 9425.04
boys and

9421.24 --> 9427.16
gay and just say like yeah this is just

9425.04 --> 9429.240000000002
that's how it is and then like oh

9427.16 --> 9432.68
millions of dead yeah that's because you

9429.24 --> 9432.68
literally sent them to get

9432.72 --> 9438.08
killed and now they died your [ __ ]

9436.08 --> 9442.88
fault you

9438.08 --> 9442.88
literally plucked them from their

9443.08 --> 9448.96
Villages gave them crazy promises told

9446.88 --> 9452.88
them to conquer a nation and now they're

9448.96 --> 9455.479
dead yeah because you sent them to die

9452.88 --> 9459.24
it's not our fault that we had to shoot

9455.479 --> 9459.24
them as they were trying to conquer

9464.8 --> 9467.8
us

9478.04 --> 9483.240000000002
but I mean yeah dude not not that I like

9481.04 --> 9486.399000000001
oh I'm looking forward to the genocide

9483.24 --> 9488.039999999999
or millions of dead people I mean if

9486.399 --> 9488.88
they want to take care of it yeah you

9488.04 --> 9492.2
could

9488.88 --> 9494.96
like you could probably like kill all of

9492.2 --> 9496.92
them like in a matter of a week you just

9494.96 --> 9499.96
send out a bunch

9496.92 --> 9502.08
drones that just start picking them off

9499.96 --> 9504.599999999999
one by one whenever they are counted

9502.08 --> 9507.279
like you send out a couple of 100,000 of

9504.6 --> 9508.84
those drones and it's like yeah oh guess

9507.279 --> 9511.84
what there's no

9508.84 --> 9511.84
more

9512.319 --> 9515.319
noncitizens

9520.52 --> 9526.92
yeah but they're not going to do

9523.8 --> 9529.08
that cuz fix fixing

9526.92 --> 9530.359
problems not in the interest of the

9529.08 --> 9532.72
government anymore they're only

9530.359 --> 9535.880000000001
interested in creating more problems so

9532.72 --> 9537.56
that they can't be gotten rid of

9535.88 --> 9539.88
government's not going to fix problems

9537.56 --> 9541.359
because that will enable the people to

9539.88 --> 9543.839999999998
get rid of

9541.359 --> 9546.640000000001
them so they're only going to make more

9543.84 --> 9549.880000000001
problems that's how it works

9546.64 --> 9551.439
now and it's not just America that's

9549.88 --> 9553.88
like most of the western governments

9551.439 --> 9556.56
they're there to make more problems for

9553.88 --> 9560.039999999999
their people so that their people can't

9556.56 --> 9562.6
get rid of them that's their tactic now

9560.04 --> 9562.6
that's what they

9578.479 --> 9583.599999999999
do oh right and by the way another

9581.04 --> 9587.240000000002
prediction 2024 is probably Russia's

9583.6 --> 9591.76
going to like invade

9587.24 --> 9595.279
Poland and other places over there in

9591.76 --> 9597.52
east Europe because they are literally

9595.279 --> 9600.12
like declaring war on

9597.52 --> 9602.560000000001
them and Russia is going to like

9600.12 --> 9604.279
splatter them and I like fully applauded

9602.56 --> 9607.08
I'm like dude

9604.279 --> 9609.399000000001
Russia I don't understand why the [ __ ]

9607.08 --> 9611.6
you let ziny do all that [ __ ] you should

9609.399 --> 9614.119999999999
have literally blown him up with a

9611.6 --> 9617.56
Hypersonic missile like in the first

9614.12 --> 9617.560000000001
[ __ ] week

9618.24 --> 9621.96
bye you could have literally spared like

9620.88 --> 9623.72
a

9621.96 --> 9627.438999999998
500,000

9623.72 --> 9627.438999999998
ukrainians with that one

9634.2 --> 9640.0
action cuz just like Bo Splat yeah he

9637.8 --> 9642.08
was a [ __ ] Invader he over through a

9640.0 --> 9645.68
government he was pro-nazi it was all

9642.08 --> 9648.439
done it was all out out in the open but

9645.68 --> 9651.04
no Russia had to do oh the do it they

9648.439 --> 9653.56
could have literally just blown him up

9651.04 --> 9656.479000000001
with a missile in the first week and

9653.56 --> 9656.479
they didn't do

9657.52 --> 9661.68
it they should have done

9673.52 --> 9678.359
that but I don't know maybe May Russia

9676.2 --> 9681.6
actually needed to like reignite its

9678.359 --> 9684.439
military industrial complex to like get

9681.6 --> 9685.76
that process going for the development

9684.439 --> 9688.319
of newer

9685.76 --> 9690.52
defenses maybe that is the reason why

9688.319 --> 9695.24
they just roll it out so slow as they

9690.52 --> 9695.24
have because they kind of like needed to

9695.56 --> 9701.64
adapt well if they had just blown up

9698.439 --> 9703.64
their Enemy at the with one shot they

9701.64 --> 9707.92
wouldn't have had that

9703.64 --> 9711.278999999999
opportunity to like slowly build in in

9707.92 --> 9714.279
like adapting your War to Modern

9711.279 --> 9714.279
situations

9718.16 --> 9722.479
yeah it's getting dark

9734.359 --> 9737.359
there

9743.0 --> 9746.88
what the hell are you talking

9744.76 --> 9750.279
about doesn't seem like you're talking

9746.88 --> 9750.278999999999
about anything that I'm talking

9764.359 --> 9767.359
about

9784.92 --> 9791.0
oh by the way hello good good to see you

9786.88 --> 9791.0
canab bear man it's like everybody's

9794.279 --> 9797.279
here

9804.359 --> 9809.439

9806.72 --> 9814.199999999999
yeah and so will you I will show it to

9809.439 --> 9814.2
you when I do my New Year's Eve live

9824.279 --> 9827.279

your nephew's Treet

9831.439 --> 9837.68
what cool I

9834.52 --> 9840.76
guess did I ever s yeah of course tered

9837.68 --> 9843.720000000001
all the time I'm

9840.76 --> 9845.960000000001
Dutch I mean I don't have firec crackers

9843.72 --> 9847.479
anymore because it's like yeah I just

9845.96 --> 9850.96
don't have the money for

9847.479 --> 9853.358999999999
that but yeah as a kid I was absolutely

9850.96 --> 9856.08
obsessed with

9853.359 --> 9858.439
fireworks like I would literally be

9856.08 --> 9861.039999999999
looking forward to like New Year's Eve

9858.439 --> 9865.12
when it was still summer it was that bad

9861.04 --> 9867.359
okay so yeah I've celebrated with

9865.12 --> 9870.68
firecrackers a

9867.359 --> 9870.68
lot as a

9879.86 --> 9883.219000000001
[Music]

9884.16 --> 9889.399
kid what no

9889.52 --> 9894.279
what I never heard of that that sounds

9892.12 --> 9897.08
like a Scandinavian thing would work in

9894.279 --> 9897.08
guny Bear not

9902.359 --> 9906.640000000001
Dutch seems like such a waste of money

9905.0 --> 9909.76
to set up fireworks when it's still

9906.64 --> 9909.76
light yeah they don't give a

9909.84 --> 9917.08
[ __ ] they just want to hear bang bang

9912.319 --> 9917.08
bang all the time so they don't care

9931.6 --> 9934.720000000001
right so I think I'm going to round out

9933.04 --> 9938.279
the

9934.72 --> 9938.278999999999
show made some

9939.399 --> 9946.56
predictions had a bit of

9942.439 --> 9948.960000000001
a baller back back and forth that was

9946.56 --> 9952.72
interesting I think today's show was all

9948.96 --> 9952.72
overall very interesting would you guys

9962.0 --> 9966.6
say w so you really liked it

9966.92 --> 9972.04
yeah I mean if you want to see how much

9969.359 --> 9976.04
I liked it then I'll just show you that

9972.04 --> 9980.080000000002
video again that I made it like 2010

9976.04 --> 9984.04
something that I typically make with my

9980.08 --> 9984.039999999999
fireworks let me try to find

9984.319 --> 9988.84
it and after that I'm going to round out

9986.72 --> 9988.84
the

9991.08 --> 9994.399
show where is

10004.0 --> 10007.0
it

10031.08 --> 10036.92
uh the hell is

10033.92 --> 10036.92
it

10043.2 --> 10045.399000000001
damn

10055.88 --> 10059.88
it where did I keep

10063.92 --> 10066.92
it

10075.359 --> 10081.12
[ __ ] I don't even know where it is where

10078.359 --> 10081.12
the hell is that

10084.2 --> 10088.12
video where did I keep

10088.6 --> 10093.800000000001
it

10091.04 --> 10096.800000000001
just I don't know where it

10093.8 --> 10096.8
is

10110.88 --> 10115.72
trying to figure out where where it

10113.399 --> 10115.72
would

10123.8 --> 10126.8
be

10128.8 --> 10134.438999999998
I mean I showed it like on my show

10131.2 --> 10137.399000000001
plenty of times in the past I just don't

10134.439 --> 10139.800000000001
know where I kept that video where the

10137.399 --> 10139.8
[ __ ] is

10153.72 --> 10156.72
it

10157.479 --> 10160.84
find it find it

10183.72 --> 10186.72
somehow

10192.72 --> 10195.239
the [ __ ] is

10205.76 --> 10211.84
it I'm just where the [ __ ] is the

10213.64 --> 10216.64
videos

10217.04 --> 10219.399000000001
where is

10243.64 --> 10246.64
it

10250.399 --> 10255.239
where did

10252.04 --> 10258.560000000001
I it's got to be so maybe it is in

10255.239 --> 10261.239
freaking videos but damn it I've got too

10258.56 --> 10261.239
many of them

10273.56 --> 10276.56
now

10287.84 --> 10292.6
that would be hilarious if it's just in

10289.72 --> 10296.239
the middle of my movie selection just a

10292.6 --> 10298.08
silly little video let's see I do know

10296.239 --> 10302.399
what it's called

10298.08 --> 10302.399
so maybe I'm just going to freaking

10303.56 --> 10306.56
search

10318.04 --> 10322.68
this might take a while but at least

10319.68 --> 10322.68
it'll get there

10323.23 --> 10326.34
[Music]

10333.479 --> 10336.479
somewhere

10338.04 --> 10343.080000000002
cool I found it now where the [ __ ] is

10349.2 --> 10352.2
it

10354.479 --> 10358.039999999999
where file

10358.16 --> 10366.439
location you can't

10361.96 --> 10366.438999999998

10377.8 --> 10384.358999999999
to show you a bit of fireworks

10381.0 --> 10386.56
video why not so you can see how much I

10384.359 --> 10386.56
like

10388.52 --> 10393.0
it I've shown this video so many

10393.359 --> 10396.359
times

10398.319 --> 10402.199999999999
right I mean this is what I

10402.68 --> 10407.800000000001
like

10404.399 --> 10407.8
hold make that

10413.88 --> 10418.0
bigger y

10419.92 --> 10426.359
right like this is what I make this is

10422.56 --> 10426.359
not what you buy in the store

10449.319 --> 10453.16
yeah that's the thing that I

10453.279 --> 10456.279
like

10470.84 --> 10475.279
yeah I call satellite killer there are

10473.72 --> 10476.56
those things now that you can buy where

10475.279 --> 10479.84
to

10476.56 --> 10482.6
go yeah no I just like them all to go

10479.84 --> 10485.52
off all at the same time so that you

10482.6 --> 10487.68
have like what the hell is happening

10485.52 --> 10490.239
kind of effect like

10487.68 --> 10492.08
whoa it kind of look because it kind of

10490.239 --> 10493.84
feels like that's what it kind of feels

10492.08 --> 10496.239
like when there's like a stockpile of

10493.84 --> 10498.92
fireworks exploding you get that kind of

10496.239 --> 10502.359
thing so I just like doing that it's

10498.92 --> 10507.279
like yeah I take a bunch of baby whistle

10502.359 --> 10509.92
arrows take like three four 500 of

10507.279 --> 10513.560000000001
them get the stick off and then all

10509.92 --> 10516.319
stick them in one big box but your

10513.56 --> 10518.8
gunpowder on the bottom and it's like

10516.319 --> 10521.84
yeah lit it up and it

10518.8 --> 10524.08
just and then they all go off like all

10521.84 --> 10525.84
at the same time that's what I do it's I

10524.08 --> 10529.56
call it a satellite killer and I just

10525.84 --> 10533.479
showed you the video what that's like

10529.56 --> 10533.479
