125.939 --> 135.2
tough to actually find my way in patreon

131.239 --> 135.20000000000002
uh let's see

145.879 --> 151.819
double whip

they call it audience now

162.0 --> 165.68
right so let's see

170.04 --> 172.879
it's not a

176.519 --> 182.519
oh yeah active right yeah Skeptics 936

180.239 --> 184.56
is patreon

182.519 --> 187.20000000000002
and gaining wisdom

184.56 --> 189.12
getting wisdom a lot actually

187.2 --> 191.33999999999997
skeptic a little

189.12 --> 193.62
but I mean getting wisdom is apparently

191.34 --> 195.72
choosing patreon as a support method

193.62 --> 198.54
over

195.72 --> 199.319
PayPal and that could work if you can do

198.54 --> 202.62
that

199.319 --> 206.48
anyway thank you for the support

202.62 --> 206.48000000000002
and all the PayPal supporters

209.04 --> 216.17999999999998
it is

210.78 --> 216.18
Saturday the 5th of August 2023

216.54 --> 219.79999999999998
weather is

220.14 --> 224.45899999999997
different

221.879 --> 227.54
maybe not really it's the weather has

224.459 --> 227.54
been kind of over the place

228.9 --> 233.18
wind was pretty strong yesterday

233.76 --> 239.42
was a clear Moon Sky a lot of it

240.599 --> 246.48
and then yeah the wind kind of laid down

243.84 --> 248.78
this morning it seems to be not so windy

246.48 --> 248.78
at all

249.84 --> 253.159
it's pretty crowded though

253.379 --> 255.92
look at that

260.639 --> 267.62
so it's a bit dark because of that but

264.0 --> 267.62
yeah there doesn't seem to be any rain

269.58 --> 273.85999999999996
and it's still decently warm I think

281.28 --> 287.0
18 degrees all right slightly colder

288.419 --> 292.19899999999996
oh

290.22 --> 294.66
according to these predictions now it

292.199 --> 297.06
says that it's gonna get really warm 26

294.66 --> 300.06
degrees on Friday

297.06 --> 300.06
okay

301.199 --> 305.90000000000003
cheer

302.58 --> 305.9
no that would be nice

308.82 --> 315.0
see if that actually is gonna

311.1 --> 317.40000000000003
still be the same prediction tomorrow

315.0 --> 322.04
right so somebody gonna show up in the

317.4 --> 322.03999999999996
chat yet I mean I was a little late but

322.38 --> 325.28
what's going on here

334.1 --> 339.38
right whatever so yeah yesterday

340.039 --> 346.32
uh

341.9 --> 348.9
finish watching archive 81

346.32 --> 350.699
the first season I mean it's definitely

348.9 --> 353.039
gonna have to have a continuation

350.699 --> 356.1
otherwise it's like the most egregious

353.039 --> 359.039
Cliffhanger open

356.1 --> 361.97900000000004
Ness it's like it's real it would be

359.039 --> 363.06
really mean to cut off series at this

361.979 --> 366.78
point

363.06 --> 368.759
so it was very good

366.78 --> 371.75899999999996
and [ __ ] up too

368.759 --> 373.68
I mean it is it is pretty [ __ ] up and

371.759 --> 375.47900000000004
it's scary

373.68 --> 379.759
and

375.479 --> 379.75899999999996
it reminds me of a whole bunch of things

384.9 --> 390.23999999999995
like a whole bunch of things and it's

387.539 --> 392.46
pretty freaky like that like it's pretty

390.24 --> 394.62
freaky for me personally

392.46 --> 396.31899999999996
so I don't know whether it's like oh my

394.62 --> 399.66
Dark World Visions

396.319 --> 401.96000000000004
that demons or the Devils tapped into

399.66 --> 405.66
that series to [ __ ] with me or something

401.96 --> 409.5
or some of that [ __ ] like might have

405.66 --> 413.03900000000004
gotten like pretty close to that

409.5 --> 416.28
although not in my direct vicinity

413.039 --> 419.34
but I'm wondering like this

416.28 --> 422.15999999999997
this shared Dark World Vision because it

419.34 --> 423.84
was shared like what the [ __ ] even is

422.16 --> 427.38000000000005
that how is that possible how are they

423.84 --> 430.73999999999995
so possibly so easy to do it like is

427.38 --> 432.3
this [ __ ] up ritual in this thing like

430.74 --> 434.699
a sort of

432.3 --> 436.979
science fictionization of something

434.699 --> 440.6
that's actually real

436.979 --> 440.59999999999997
did I tap into that

443.94 --> 449.94
also because like in the series like

447.18 --> 450.96
because of the information if they sort

449.94 --> 453.599
of make it

450.96 --> 455.15999999999997
like it's temporary it's like a

453.599 --> 457.979
temporary thing

455.16 --> 459.84000000000003
I don't know it it's really [ __ ] dark

457.979 --> 461.81899999999996
when you think about it carefully I mean

459.84 --> 464.69899999999996
that series is

461.819 --> 469.34000000000003
probably one of the most spooky series

464.699 --> 472.44
I've ever seen and that's saying a lot

469.34 --> 474.0
it's the spookiest Siri ever and there's

472.44 --> 476.96
no ghosts

474.0 --> 476.96
not really

477.599 --> 483.96
like that's not even involved here

481.08 --> 484.979
although it's supposed to but it IT Tech

483.96 --> 487.44
yeah

484.979 --> 489.78
well there's a bit of like a medium

487.44 --> 491.639
like talking for the dead and all that

489.78 --> 493.67999999999995
you could call that spooky but it's not

491.639 --> 498.06
really spooky

493.68 --> 501.479
anyway hello LSG first in chat Richard G

498.06 --> 504.5
Jason C watchmaker

501.479 --> 504.5
good to see you all

505.74 --> 510.86
it is Saturday the 5th of August 2023

512.039 --> 517.64
I didn't say that already whatever how

515.039 --> 517.64
are you guys doing

518.06 --> 523.279
everyone is sleeping in

520.62 --> 523.279
huh

532.68 --> 535.2199999999999
okay

538.65 --> 541.789
[Music]

552.839 --> 559.9200000000001
right so yeah however you want to see it

556.279 --> 563.1
the series it's very interesting but

559.92 --> 567.26
it's also like it just does potentially

563.1 --> 567.26
reveal something really [ __ ] dark

568.5 --> 574.68
that's not just oh Spooky's Superstition

572.94 --> 576.0
science fiction

574.68 --> 578.2199999999999
in a way

576.0 --> 580.56
although I don't think there's anything

578.22 --> 582.36
that's literally like that

580.56 --> 585.3
but

582.36 --> 587.399
things they talk about

585.3 --> 589.26
keeping a world in your mind and all

587.399 --> 592.26
that I mean that sounds really familiar

589.26 --> 594.66
it sounds so familiar actually that I'm

592.26 --> 596.7
pretty sure that that is what

594.66 --> 599.88
like guys

596.7 --> 603.44
when I was younger I was really gullible

599.88 --> 606.8389999999999
super eager I had absolutely no

603.44 --> 608.399
conception of evil and I'm pretty sure

606.839 --> 612.4200000000001
that

608.399 --> 614.64
on multiple occasions not one

612.42 --> 618.959
they attempted to recruit me into

614.64 --> 623.279
literally be a [ __ ] ritual sacrifice

618.959 --> 627.8
and I didn't bite in it and I like

623.279 --> 627.8
like even didn't even take offense to it

627.959 --> 631.399
I should have of course

632.58 --> 636.6600000000001
right

634.32 --> 639.36
but in a way also like it's weird

636.66 --> 642.8389999999999
because I

639.36 --> 645.9590000000001
I would be so [ __ ] interested in all

642.839 --> 650.0600000000001
of it that it's almost I would like

645.959 --> 650.06
be like yeah you can use me

650.519 --> 655.44
but

651.959 --> 658.7399999999999
knowing that I wasn't really gonna do it

655.44 --> 661.62
and like making sure instinctually that

658.74 --> 664.5
I don't like oh yeah I'm on the table

661.62 --> 666.42
knife is above me like hey I might not

664.5 --> 668.64
want to do yeah I'm not that [ __ ]

666.42 --> 670.1999999999999
[ __ ] yeah I know that if you're

668.64 --> 673.3199999999999
gonna be trapped

670.2 --> 675.36
in New York they will gonna do it anyway

673.32 --> 678.12
so I was like

675.36 --> 681.92
kind of leading them on as to like yeah

678.12 --> 681.92
I am gullible enough to do that

682.68 --> 690.2399999999999
and then didn't do it it was all really

686.399 --> 692.76
[ __ ] up risky in retrospect

690.24 --> 694.44
but also it just revealed that there

692.76 --> 698.3
were people out there that would

694.44 --> 698.3000000000001
actually be okay with doing that

703.079 --> 708.8389999999999
so yeah it the the series is fascinating

706.2 --> 711.24
but it reveals something seriously

708.839 --> 714.0600000000001
seriously [ __ ] up

711.24 --> 717.1800000000001
and like the thing that is like sort of

714.06 --> 720.1199999999999
the the central thing

717.18 --> 721.3199999999999
where you slowly catching on more and

720.12 --> 724.14
more

721.32 --> 725.6400000000001
like that may be like based on real

724.14 --> 727.4399999999999
things

725.64 --> 731.579
to a degree

727.44 --> 734.82
like to the degree where it's like that

731.579 --> 737.0999999999999
there's really an effect

734.82 --> 739.9200000000001
that's real and I might have actually

737.1 --> 742.74
tapped into that indirectly

739.92 --> 745.38
I'm not entirely sure even how it works

742.74 --> 747.36
they don't completely elucidate it like

745.38 --> 751.1
they might

747.36 --> 751.1
like do it again

753.54 --> 756.079
well

757.14 --> 760.04
no yeah

760.68 --> 766.26
like I'm talking about the real world

763.2 --> 767.899
like there might have been an act yeah I

766.26 --> 770.8199999999999
don't want a [ __ ] spoil the series

767.899 --> 771.899
this is I'm not gonna do it I'm not

770.82 --> 773.7
gonna

771.899 --> 775.86
you're gonna have to watch it and be

773.7 --> 778.639
really like what the [ __ ]

775.86 --> 782.519
like I did and I mean this series is

778.639 --> 784.86
[ __ ] scary and I mean really [ __ ]

782.519 --> 787.5600000000001
scary they are constantly playing with

784.86 --> 790.92
sounds like there's barely there's no

787.56 --> 793.9799999999999
music basically there's just weird

790.92 --> 797.579
[ __ ] sounds that are all ominous and

793.98 --> 800.04
scary but not like Gothic like oh or

797.579 --> 804.779
something but like

800.04 --> 806.88
like weird weird creepy surreal alien

804.779 --> 809.82
like

806.88 --> 812.22
it's they [ __ ] with you on a spiritual

809.82 --> 815.339
level it's really it's scary and it's

812.22 --> 818.279
like if you are

815.339 --> 821.22
emotionally unstable

818.279 --> 824.459
like or like with your own identity your

821.22 --> 827.0400000000001
ego you have serious issues you

824.459 --> 829.8599999999999
I don't know you're like suicidal or

827.04 --> 831.7199999999999
whatever this is not the [ __ ] series

829.86 --> 834.62
to watch in a moment like that and I

831.72 --> 834.62
mean you need to be

834.779 --> 839.76
pretty good with yourself

837.12 --> 842.48
or I bet that this series can really

839.76 --> 842.48
[ __ ] with you

842.82 --> 847.4590000000001
definitely not for kids

850.92 --> 856.26
but it is very fascinating though

853.92 --> 859.56
and the way they address the Dark World

856.26 --> 862.38
and also like play on your senses like

859.56 --> 865.9799999999999
the snapping in and out

862.38 --> 869.3389999999999
I mean it's it's really convincing like

865.98 --> 871.6800000000001
that's just like it's like looking at

869.339 --> 872.8800000000001
like a person that's probably been

871.68 --> 876.2399999999999
through that

872.88 --> 879.48
in order to even know like they the the

876.24 --> 882.54
filmmaker either has went through Dark

879.48 --> 885.1800000000001
World [ __ ] like this himself probably on

882.54 --> 887.519
Ayahuasca or something or they had

885.18 --> 888.959
definitely like elaborately talked to

887.519 --> 890.88
somebody that has that explain

888.959 --> 893.1199999999999
everything in the cessations and all

890.88 --> 893.12
that

893.459 --> 897.899
because

895.079 --> 902.04
like that just looked really [ __ ]

897.899 --> 906.18
real like it it gave you the difficulty

902.04 --> 907.62
of not entirely being certain how this

906.18 --> 910.8
is happening

907.62 --> 912.9590000000001
that effect which is exactly what was

910.8 --> 916.199
happening every [ __ ] time with my

912.959 --> 918.54
Dark World Visions every single time and

916.199 --> 921.3599999999999
they really play

918.54 --> 923.399
into it

921.36 --> 925.38
when it actually happens in the series

923.399 --> 927.12
like with what the Consciousness is

925.38 --> 928.68
doing it's like a

927.12 --> 931.74
it

928.68 --> 934.079
it's pretty freaking impressive

931.74 --> 937.5600000000001
like I am really fascinated by this

934.079 --> 942.0
series and I'm like holy [ __ ] like

937.56 --> 945.0
they must have a second Siri like a

942.0 --> 947.639
second season follow-up like

945.0 --> 950.04
like this crazy

947.639 --> 951.9590000000001
it would be there would be [ __ ] like

950.04 --> 954.66
completely [ __ ] if they didn't like

951.959 --> 959.1199999999999
there's like so much that's like just

954.66 --> 959.12
waiting to burst forth from this story

960.0 --> 962.54
anyway

969.0 --> 973.22
oh okay Blue Blood Evolution hello

975.959 --> 980.1199999999999
deprived of research yeah well that's

977.94 --> 982.0790000000001
not what this is about

980.12 --> 984.54
the series

982.079 --> 987.66
but yeah I know that when people deprive

984.54 --> 990.06
the resources can get really [ __ ] up

987.66 --> 992.88
but I mean that's something that you'd

990.06 --> 996.0
at least expect

992.88 --> 998.699
it's a sad expectation but it is an

996.0 --> 1001.839
expectation what happens in this series

998.699 --> 1001.8389999999999
is like now

1001.88 --> 1006.56
that's a dark nature of a whole

1004.16 --> 1009.199
different kind

1006.56 --> 1011.2399999999999
it's not the instincts that overrides

1009.199 --> 1013.54
the the higher Spirit no it's something

1011.24 --> 1013.54
else

1021.44 --> 1024.579
anyway hello dank

1027.38 --> 1032.6200000000001
right so anyhow I'm really impressed by

1030.199 --> 1032.6200000000001
the series

1033.98 --> 1039.199
the actors are also like doing a pretty

1037.88 --> 1043.0590000000002
good job

1039.199 --> 1043.059
they got some good types in there

1047.66 --> 1053.66
look what it basically [ __ ] is it's

1050.12 --> 1055.82
about really serious dark witchcraft

1053.66 --> 1059.419
they eventually start using that word

1055.82 --> 1061.76
too in reference to the situation

1059.419 --> 1064.94
it is

1061.76 --> 1068.179
and like some of it is is based on the

1064.94 --> 1070.3400000000001
real things that they're ah damn it I

1068.179 --> 1072.98
don't want to [ __ ] spoil it I want to

1070.34 --> 1076.28
talk about it so [ __ ] bad but I mean

1072.98 --> 1078.74
that would literally [ __ ] spoil it

1076.28 --> 1081.559
so I'm not gonna do it [ __ ] you just

1078.74 --> 1084.46
watch it watch the [ __ ] show and get

1081.559 --> 1084.46
back to me okay

1084.799 --> 1087.46
damn it

1104.299 --> 1107.26
what show

1107.84 --> 1114.86
the one I literally have posted four

1111.26 --> 1118.419
sentences above you in the chat

1114.86 --> 1118.4189999999999
iron 26 hello

1128.12 --> 1131.62
what the hell okay

1143.66 --> 1149.02
messed up yeah I guess blue pill

1146.48 --> 1149.02
devolution

1157.88 --> 1160.88
okay

1171.799 --> 1176.96
I mean did they witness any of that or

1174.38 --> 1179.72
was just a story I mean if they're just

1176.96 --> 1183.16
collecting stories like people can make

1179.72 --> 1183.16
up stories too you know

1184.58 --> 1192.1599999999999
to like exaggerate on how bad it is as a

1188.72 --> 1192.16
victim strategy

1201.38 --> 1204.7600000000002
but I mean yeah

1204.94 --> 1213.2
when things are super desperate and food

1207.919 --> 1213.2
is like super scarce yes some

1213.919 --> 1218.419
sometimes it's like people just give up

1216.559 --> 1220.1
on like the value of babies because

1218.419 --> 1221.419
there's like no way you can keep them

1220.1 --> 1223.9399999999998
alive

1221.419 --> 1226.8400000000001
in that condition yeah it just happens

1223.94 --> 1226.8400000000001
it's [ __ ] up

1240.44 --> 1245.8400000000001
because because blue pill the evolution

1243.14 --> 1247.8200000000002
on a physical level and talking about

1245.84 --> 1250.9399999999998
the biology the

1247.82 --> 1254.48
the Instinct of the body not so much the

1250.94 --> 1257.299
higher Spirit yeah

1254.48 --> 1260.72
if everybody's starving

1257.299 --> 1262.22
I mean to keep a baby alive is really

1260.72 --> 1264.919
difficult it's going to be a drain on

1262.22 --> 1266.8600000000001
you it's more effective

1264.919 --> 1270.44
the cat

1266.86 --> 1273.32
God dope yeah don't [ __ ] quote me on

1270.44 --> 1274.88
this it's more effective to just let it

1273.32 --> 1278.8999999999999
die and then

1274.88 --> 1281.2990000000002
when times get better make a new baby

1278.9 --> 1284.6000000000001
I'm talking about physical survival

1281.299 --> 1288.08
level basically animal

1284.6 --> 1290.26
level strategy I mean it's it's just a

1288.08 --> 1290.26
fact

1290.659 --> 1296.3200000000002
now of course that doesn't mean that

1293.059 --> 1300.32
every woman will just be able to

1296.32 --> 1302.299
maintain their sanity with that a lot

1300.32 --> 1304.8799999999999
will absolutely they will [ __ ] die

1302.299 --> 1308.179
with that baby

1304.88 --> 1311.14
they're too connected right

1308.179 --> 1314.799
but it is

1311.14 --> 1314.7990000000002
biologically logical

1318.26 --> 1322.4
yeah

1319.94 --> 1326.3200000000002
they're not talking about that iron 26

1322.4 --> 1328.46
way to go make it even like Jesus

1326.32 --> 1331.34
[Music]

1328.46 --> 1333.58
is not talking about that okay what the

1331.34 --> 1333.58
[ __ ]

1341.179 --> 1343.8400000000001
women

1346.34 --> 1350.12
it's crazy though like why the [ __ ]

1348.5 --> 1353.62
would you eat a leopard that's really

1350.12 --> 1353.62
bad meat to eat

1355.46 --> 1360.32
I mean really bad meat especially if

1358.58 --> 1363.4399999999998
you're starving I mean you're gonna like

1360.32 --> 1364.7
just assimilate all kinds of parasite

1363.44 --> 1367.46
[ __ ]

1364.7 --> 1370.179
just like that

1367.46 --> 1370.179
yuck

1379.7 --> 1384.26
it's an interesting well I'm glad you're

1383.0 --> 1387.82
enjoying it

1384.26 --> 1387.82
I'm gonna skip on that one

1392.72 --> 1397.76
if there's any other interesting details

1395.419 --> 1399.74
about human behavior

1397.76 --> 1401.6589999999999
that you'd like to share with me I'll

1399.74 --> 1405.159
hear about it as long as it doesn't get

1401.659 --> 1405.159
that [ __ ] dark please

1406.64 --> 1411.14
that what kind of wood chat did you I

1408.62 --> 1413.4189999999999
don't know watchmaker

1411.14 --> 1415.22
it got really dark I don't know why

1413.419 --> 1418.76
maybe it's because I brought up the

1415.22 --> 1422.72
freaking series archive 81 and it is

1418.76 --> 1426.8799999999999
really dark in there

1422.72 --> 1426.88
like you figure that out slowly

1427.159 --> 1430.3400000000001
but uh

1428.9 --> 1433.7800000000002
yeah I don't know why blue pill

1430.34 --> 1433.78
Devolution brought that up

1441.559 --> 1447.3799999999999
okay

1443.919 --> 1451.64
it's double conspiracy shows Stars

1447.38 --> 1454.24
barely moved from 300 3 000 mile flight

1451.64 --> 1454.24
really

1458.659 --> 1462.46
oh you're ready years ago

1463.64 --> 1466.0
right

1467.48 --> 1470.6
yeah well to be fair bloop they'll

1469.46 --> 1473.179
definitely yeah you could say it's

1470.6 --> 1475.6399999999999
telling but

1473.179 --> 1477.799
in my experience it's like when people

1475.64 --> 1481.6000000000001
get like demoralized because of

1477.799 --> 1481.6
circumstance like everything changes

1482.96 --> 1486.58
they just become like

1489.5 --> 1495.679
more like animals

1491.48 --> 1497.3600000000001
but but like you can't really blame him

1495.679 --> 1500.02
for it I mean you should absolutely

1497.36 --> 1500.02
defend yourself

1500.9 --> 1505.039
but it's it's just a thing it's a

1503.299 --> 1506.9
survival mechanism

1505.039 --> 1510.26
it really is

1506.9 --> 1515.179
I mean if you're like forced to do in

1510.26 --> 1518.9
such a situation you should not like

1515.179 --> 1520.64
God does basically suppress your senses

1518.9 --> 1524.419
then

1520.64 --> 1526.22
because otherwise you just snap well

1524.419 --> 1528.8600000000001
what basically happens is that the

1526.22 --> 1531.98
spirit the more conscious Spirit the

1528.86 --> 1534.08
Consciousness like leaves the body

1531.98 --> 1537.14
and you're just left with your more

1534.08 --> 1539.299
rudimentary instincts so that you don't

1537.14 --> 1544.279
concern yourself

1539.299 --> 1546.3799999999999
with like any intellect higher spiritual

1544.279 --> 1549.32
consequences of whatever it is that

1546.38 --> 1552.919
you're doing then because you are just

1549.32 --> 1554.0
you're just the only objective is to

1552.919 --> 1556.7
survive

1554.0 --> 1561.08
and and nothing else matters then

1556.7 --> 1563.299
right that yeah that's what can happen

1561.08 --> 1566.12
but it is natural for that to happen

1563.299 --> 1567.98
it's just really [ __ ] up when it does

1566.12 --> 1572.26
but I mean

1567.98 --> 1572.26
if that instinct wasn't there then

1572.48 --> 1578.919
a lot more people

1575.12 --> 1578.9189999999999
would die in the world

1579.94 --> 1584.48
it's like you get cut off or something

1582.679 --> 1587.02
yeah well then a lot of people would

1584.48 --> 1587.02
just die

1590.36 --> 1595.58
or everyone I don't know

1593.539 --> 1597.32
this is all really dark anyway hey

1595.58 --> 1599.799
Amanda young good to see you George

1597.32 --> 1599.799
Sanford

1601.64 --> 1607.94
George Sanford are you the ones making

1604.22 --> 1610.88
those weird ass comments I mean I had a

1607.94 --> 1612.799
in my comment section I was a George

1610.88 --> 1616.3400000000001
Samford

1612.799 --> 1619.58
who actually had the gall to respond to

1616.34 --> 1623.48
my comment saying Black Swan

1619.58 --> 1626.299
question mark with bendy cranes

1623.48 --> 1628.52
is that seriously your response or are

1626.299 --> 1632.12
you like being sarcastic playing a

1628.52 --> 1635.679
baller George Sanford I'd like to have a

1632.12 --> 1635.6789999999999
straight answer to that right now

1642.02 --> 1648.62
where you actually share seriously

1644.6 --> 1652.3999999999999
making an argument with bendy cranes

1648.62 --> 1656.1999999999998
great proof of what George Sanford

1652.4 --> 1656.2
great proof of what

1658.039 --> 1663.4
what are they great proof of Jordan

1660.799 --> 1663.4
Sanford

1671.179 --> 1674.14
refraction

1675.08 --> 1678.1
yes so

1686.24 --> 1691.059
what is what does that have to do with

1688.279 --> 1691.059
the Black Swan

1694.46 --> 1702.4
are you a [ __ ] Baltar George Sanford

1697.659 --> 1702.4
are you a ball [ __ ]

1707.36 --> 1712.12
cause I know akumu virus is a ball [ __ ]

1712.46 --> 1715.64
I would expect him to say something like

1714.86 --> 1719.3799999999999
that

1715.64 --> 1719.38
I didn't think that you were

1723.559 --> 1729.32
is that how they dismiss it yeah it's

1726.559 --> 1732.9189999999999
there that's what ball tards do Richard

1729.32 --> 1735.4399999999998
G they say refraction yeah that's where

1732.919 --> 1737.72
the [ __ ] comes from

1735.44 --> 1740.6200000000001
from people saying refraction in

1737.72 --> 1744.5
response to Black Swan which immediately

1740.62 --> 1749.1999999999998
invokes immediately

1744.5 --> 1749.2
in folks the arwenian paradox

1750.679 --> 1756.0800000000002
been here many years means that you're a

1752.96 --> 1758.559
realm earther not a flat or yeah yeah

1756.08 --> 1761.48
well it is a baltarted argument though

1758.559 --> 1763.46
and what the [ __ ] is even the point of

1761.48 --> 1765.919
saying that

1763.46 --> 1768.26
like do you you're a [ __ ] concaver

1765.919 --> 1771.8600000000001
you're worse than a baller George

1768.26 --> 1776.0
Sanford do you hear me George Sanford

1771.86 --> 1779.3799999999999
to be a concaver a realm or whatever the

1776.0 --> 1785.36
[ __ ] you're gonna call it non-flatter

1779.38 --> 1788.659
your more [ __ ] than simandan

1785.36 --> 1794.1399999999999
yeah you're more [ __ ] than fight the

1788.659 --> 1794.14
Flat Earth do you hear me George Sanford

1797.24 --> 1804.74
you're using an argument

1800.24 --> 1806.84
from The baltart Reflex pole and you're

1804.74 --> 1809.659
not even a ball you're not even a ball

1806.84 --> 1812.72
earther you're using an argument that

1809.659 --> 1814.22
you don't even [ __ ] know what that

1812.72 --> 1817.3990000000001
implies

1814.22 --> 1821.1200000000001
how that's gonna relate to your presumed

1817.399 --> 1824.2399999999998
[ __ ] model of concave Earth

1821.12 --> 1826.76
so you're literally using arguments that

1824.24 --> 1829.64
don't even help anything

1826.76 --> 1833.72
it's pathetic

1829.64 --> 1837.5590000000002
you're pathetic George Sanford

1833.72 --> 1841.22
you're not only a Downy Debbie Downer on

1837.559 --> 1842.899
a regular occasion you are the worst

1841.22 --> 1845.3600000000001
argumentator

1842.899 --> 1847.9399999999998
that I've ever come across in my chat

1845.36 --> 1850.9399999999998
and I can't believe

1847.94 --> 1854.48
that you that you have the

1850.94 --> 1859.039
the lack of Consciousness and and

1854.48 --> 1862.3990000000001
Sensibility and ability to to perceive

1859.039 --> 1866.14
shame in order to actually [ __ ] say

1862.399 --> 1866.1399999999999
that straightforward in my chat

1867.32 --> 1873.02
I can't believe that you are that

1869.799 --> 1876.62
desensitized that you can utter

1873.02 --> 1879.74
that form of argumentation which isn't

1876.62 --> 1882.26
even any form of advantage to your

1879.74 --> 1884.0
cosmological opinion

1882.26 --> 1886.399
my friend

1884.0 --> 1890.059
it's pathetic

1886.399 --> 1891.32
you should be ashamed of yourself York

1890.059 --> 1895.46
Sanford

1891.32 --> 1899.74
you should be ashamed of yourself

1895.46 --> 1899.74
look at what you just said

1900.76 --> 1904.6
it's pathetic

1920.32 --> 1926.96
you're just as [ __ ] dumb

1924.74 --> 1931.039
Simon then

1926.96 --> 1934.279
and fight the Flat Earth yeah

1931.039 --> 1938.12
and I'm going to regard you

1934.279 --> 1942.38
and keep you regarded like that because

1938.12 --> 1945.1399999999999
you just shamelessly double down on one

1942.38 --> 1947.8400000000001
of the dumbest [ __ ] things a person

1945.14 --> 1950.179
could ever say in relation to his

1947.84 --> 1954.5
argument

1950.179 --> 1958.88
and you're too [ __ ] din to even get

1954.5 --> 1963.08
that right now George Sanford

1958.88 --> 1965.2600000000002
look at you look at what's coming out of

1963.08 --> 1965.26
you

1967.46 --> 1971.059
you're [ __ ]

1975.97 --> 1979.039
[Music]

1992.919 --> 1997.039
oh thanks blue pill that Lucia don't

1995.299 --> 1999.2
worry about it

1997.039 --> 2001.62
I know what I am I know what what I'm

1999.2 --> 2001.6200000000001
gonna be

2001.96 --> 2008.74
my hair is still fine

2004.72 --> 2011.82
I mean yeah it's not perfect anymore but

2008.74 --> 2011.82
I'm good with it

2019.419 --> 2024.46
not true what's going on here yeah it's

2021.7 --> 2026.7
called a berating watchmaker yeah I'm

2024.46 --> 2031.72
berating George Sanford

2026.7 --> 2035.019
for taking a bald-hearted argument

2031.72 --> 2037.6000000000001
that's like one of the most easily

2035.019 --> 2040.72
debunked and dispelled arguments that

2037.6 --> 2043.299
anybody could ever make in relation to

2040.72 --> 2046.299
the Black Swan argument it literally

2043.299 --> 2051.82
points at the Armenian Paradox called

2046.299 --> 2054.599
the arwinian Paradox because in 2017

2051.82 --> 2059.44
I figured it out

2054.599 --> 2062.9190000000003
no 20 in 2020 I'm sorry I keep mixing it

2059.44 --> 2065.08
up 17 we were still

2062.919 --> 2066.7599999999998
like

2065.08 --> 2068.7999999999997
we're still like on the Isle of Man

2066.76 --> 2071.8
there was no official Black Swan

2068.8 --> 2073.96
argumentation and that's when the Dandy

2071.8 --> 2076.599
cranes came in relation to the blacks us

2073.96 --> 2079.3
2020. so in 2020

2076.599 --> 2081.2400000000002
I figured out that this response

2079.3 --> 2085.179
refraction

2081.24 --> 2089.02
induces The Armenian Paradox what is a

2085.179 --> 2092.76
paradox what is the Paradox okay right

2089.02 --> 2092.7599999999998
well the Paradox is is that

2093.58 --> 2099.66
if you're gonna say refraction

2097.24 --> 2103.18
justifies

2099.66 --> 2106.5
why the horizon

2103.18 --> 2110.02
does not appear to be in its

2106.5 --> 2112.5
geometrically required position on the

2110.02 --> 2112.5
ball Earth

2112.66 --> 2116.98
like if if you're going to invoke

2114.4 --> 2119.8
refraction well then

2116.98 --> 2123.339
that means that you have no stable

2119.8 --> 2126.7000000000003
grounding in order to have established

2123.339 --> 2129.22
the radius value for Earth because guess

2126.7 --> 2133.2999999999997
how you get the radius value for Earth

2129.22 --> 2135.7599999999998
yeah besides assuming what it is

2133.3 --> 2137.92
you have to measure it and the only way

2135.76 --> 2141.28
to measure it

2137.92 --> 2146.079
or it to start to attempt to measure it

2141.28 --> 2149.38
would be to perceive The Horizon

2146.079 --> 2152.2000000000003
and its geometric traits that it would

2149.38 --> 2155.52
have to have if the Earth was a ball

2152.2 --> 2159.5789999999997
well Black Swan observations

2155.52 --> 2162.88
violate that geometry

2159.579 --> 2165.94
they ensure that the Horizon is not in

2162.88 --> 2168.6400000000003
it geometrically required position and

2165.94 --> 2171.52
then to say refraction is the reason for

2168.64 --> 2176.52
that well then you can never have gotten

2171.52 --> 2176.52
the radius value because you need

2177.0 --> 2184.119
refraction not to change everything

2180.46 --> 2188.52
around all the time to even be able to

2184.119 --> 2188.52
actually get a radius measurement

2191.619 --> 2196.0
yeah otherwise it's just like no we're

2193.66 --> 2199.8999999999996
just calculating it well calculating is

2196.0 --> 2202.54
not proof you have no measured proof

2199.9 --> 2204.339
if you can't measure the Horizon because

2202.54 --> 2207.66
it's refracted

2204.339 --> 2211.06
you need to be able to

2207.66 --> 2213.94
accurately measure the Horizon as

2211.06 --> 2215.859
geometric being consistent with the

2213.94 --> 2222.2200000000003
globe Earth geometry

2215.859 --> 2225.22
in order to have the radius value for

2222.22 --> 2226.7799999999997
the globe Earth geometry

2225.22 --> 2229.4199999999996
yeah

2226.78 --> 2232.0600000000004
you need to measure that well if you're

2229.42 --> 2234.76
going to say refraction refraction bends

2232.06 --> 2237.7
it into an apparent flat plane well that

2234.76 --> 2240.9
formula that terrestrial refraction

2237.7 --> 2243.96
standard refraction refraction formula

2240.9 --> 2249.28
has within it officially

2243.96 --> 2251.5
a radius the r it literally has r that

2249.28 --> 2254.98
stands for radius

2251.5 --> 2255.7
within it is within the calculations for

2254.98 --> 2257.32
it

2255.7 --> 2258.7599999999998
well

2257.32 --> 2262.96
if

2258.76 --> 2267.5200000000004
you would need the radius value within

2262.96 --> 2270.339
the calculations in order to be able to

2267.52 --> 2273.46
have terrestrial refraction

2270.339 --> 2276.2799999999997
then you can't after astral refraction

2273.46 --> 2279.579
because

2276.28 --> 2282.76
the terrestrial refraction ensures that

2279.579 --> 2285.3390000000004
you cannot attain the radius value that

2282.76 --> 2288.2200000000003
you would require for a terrestrial

2285.339 --> 2293.099
refraction to be calculable

2288.22 --> 2293.0989999999997
yeah that's the Armenian paradox

2294.88 --> 2302.82
you can't have a radius value and

2298.839 --> 2302.82
terrestrial refraction at the same time

2303.7 --> 2308.3799999999997
terrestrial refraction undoes the radial

2306.22 --> 2311.3799999999997
value and thereby itself because it

2308.38 --> 2315.599
requires the measured radius value in

2311.38 --> 2315.599
order to even be a thing yeah

2318.18 --> 2325.7799999999997
bendy cranes is the dumbest [ __ ] dead

2321.94 --> 2329.579
end statement anybody could ever make in

2325.78 --> 2329.579
response to Black Swan

2331.32 --> 2335.04
hello Li Young

2339.64 --> 2344.16
so there you go that's the irwinian

2341.619 --> 2344.1600000000003
paradox

2348.82 --> 2354.7000000000003
and I can't believe that this guy in my

2352.06 --> 2357.22
chat and he now has gone away yeah

2354.7 --> 2359.68
George Sanford that he actually wrote

2357.22 --> 2362.3199999999997
that out he probably realizes how

2359.68 --> 2366.16
[ __ ] [ __ ] he really is about that

2362.32 --> 2368.2000000000003
it just let himself slip into it so it's

2366.16 --> 2370.48
like oh it's easier to be a dumb Beast

2368.2 --> 2374.52
yeah and now I just remind him you're a

2370.48 --> 2374.52
really dumb [ __ ] beast for doing that

2375.16 --> 2382.1189999999997
it's pathetic it doesn't even help your

2378.46 --> 2384.88
[ __ ] cosmology dude you is so dumb to

2382.119 --> 2387.88
do that it just shows you're completely

2384.88 --> 2390.88
incompetent and have no logical grounds

2387.88 --> 2393.28
to even believe your [ __ ] cosmology

2390.88 --> 2396.94
concave

2393.28 --> 2401.28
you're just a religious idiot that

2396.94 --> 2401.28
believes in things that he cannot reason

2402.839 --> 2410.2
I detest people that believe in things

2407.38 --> 2412.8
they cannot reason

2410.2 --> 2412.7999999999997
yeah

2413.339 --> 2420.96
who is the Korean bendy because of

2416.8 --> 2420.96
refraction actual refraction

2421.0 --> 2426.72
you understand that actual refraction

2423.52 --> 2429.94
yeah that that stuff that's

2426.72 --> 2433.48
insignificant it's just like it blurs

2429.94 --> 2436.839
things up a bit my displays some visuals

2433.48 --> 2438.4
in relation to the Horizon and not the

2436.839 --> 2441.339
Horizon itself

2438.4 --> 2445.0
so yeah one would expect to see some

2441.339 --> 2446.859
Distortion very far away very close to

2445.0 --> 2448.839
the horizon

2446.859 --> 2451.96
when there is that kind of a long

2448.839 --> 2454.66
distance visual available

2451.96 --> 2457.839
that's actual refraction it's just the

2454.66 --> 2460.54
Distortion of the visuals in relation to

2457.839 --> 2462.46
the Horizon it might warp it a bit right

2460.54 --> 2466.56
so there's definitely refraction

2462.46 --> 2470.02
happening however there is certainly not

2466.56 --> 2471.94
terrestrial refraction happening which

2470.02 --> 2475.24
is what people mean when they say

2471.94 --> 2477.52
refraction in response to the Black Swan

2475.24 --> 2480.54
they don't mean actual refraction no

2477.52 --> 2484.48
they mean seven over six are

2480.54 --> 2486.22
bendy around a ball refraction that's

2484.48 --> 2486.94
what they're talking about when they say

2486.22 --> 2489.0989999999997
that

2486.94 --> 2491.619
yeah because that's what you're gonna

2489.099 --> 2495.04
repeal to like oh there's some blurry

2491.619 --> 2497.2000000000003
that means it's not flat because it's

2495.04 --> 2500.32
flat it means because there's refraction

2497.2 --> 2503.2599999999998
happening the special boy seven over six

2500.32 --> 2505.48
are terrestrial refraction that bends it

2503.26 --> 2508.2400000000002
into a flat plane because of a visual

2505.48 --> 2511.599
effect and there are some blurry stuff

2508.24 --> 2515.74
that's the proof that that 7 over 6r is

2511.599 --> 2518.079
there according to you yeah

2515.74 --> 2521.4599999999996
that's what that is

2518.079 --> 2527.02
but guess what actual refraction doesn't

2521.46 --> 2528.46
displace The Horizon in relation to the

2527.02 --> 2530.92
horizon

2528.46 --> 2533.079
yeah can displace The Horizon only

2530.92 --> 2537.1800000000003
things in relation to it like objects

2533.079 --> 2537.1800000000003
Towers things sticking out

2537.28 --> 2542.7400000000002
that might be displaced yeah might be

2540.22 --> 2544.7799999999997
going downward or even upward and then

2542.74 --> 2547.839
you have like a weird Superior Mirage

2544.78 --> 2550.6600000000003
thing yeah that's that's all refraction

2547.839 --> 2555.46
now what refraction does not do however

2550.66 --> 2556.5989999999997
is change the apparent position of the

2555.46 --> 2560.2200000000003
horizon

2556.599 --> 2563.52
that's what actual refraction absolutely

2560.22 --> 2563.52
cannot do

2565.0 --> 2567.599
yeah

2567.88 --> 2573.04
what it can do at best is simply obscure

2571.359 --> 2574.24
everything

2573.04 --> 2577.24
like

2574.24 --> 2579.4599999999996
have it so be so moist that you

2577.24 --> 2581.859
literally can't see further that means

2579.46 --> 2585.599
that the air is thick

2581.859 --> 2585.5989999999997
you don't see as far

2586.119 --> 2592.42
so things that would normally be visible

2588.579 --> 2594.46
at the Horizon suddenly are gone they're

2592.42 --> 2597.579
gone they're not visible they're folded

2594.46 --> 2599.56
within the Horizon because the line of

2597.579 --> 2602.079
sight has shortened

2599.56 --> 2604.0
because of well you can say lensing

2602.079 --> 2607.0
effects or refraction the thickness of

2604.0 --> 2610.0
the medium changes just like you can't

2607.0 --> 2612.7
see that far underwater

2610.0 --> 2614.68
because of the same effect now you

2612.7 --> 2617.859
definitely know there's more stuff there

2614.68 --> 2619.7799999999997
but you just can't see it

2617.859 --> 2621.94
because it's

2619.78 --> 2623.6800000000003
it's being refracted it's blurred up

2621.94 --> 2627.339
it's scattered it's all these things

2623.68 --> 2629.44
it's not within visual range

2627.339 --> 2631.839
and then you get out of the water and

2629.44 --> 2634.78
you look over it and then you can

2631.839 --> 2637.119
definitely see that buoy stick out there

2634.78 --> 2638.8
in it at the distance even though when

2637.119 --> 2641.619
you look underwater you're not seeing

2638.8 --> 2644.98
the underside of that buoy you can't

2641.619 --> 2647.319
it's too far away yeah well that happens

2644.98 --> 2649.599
in the air

2647.319 --> 2651.4
sometimes the air is really thin and

2649.599 --> 2653.5
then you can see super far sometimes

2651.4 --> 2655.359
it's really thick with moist a lot of

2653.5 --> 2657.7
moist has evaporated

2655.359 --> 2661.02
it's in there and then you don't see as

2657.7 --> 2664.2999999999997
far and you might see those bendy cranes

2661.02 --> 2667.359
suddenly appear like like they're oop

2664.3 --> 2669.099
almost fallen just over the edge it's

2667.359 --> 2671.619
like they're falling over the edge right

2669.099 --> 2674.619
it's definitely not behind the curve

2671.619 --> 2676.3
because it's a gigantic distance up

2674.619 --> 2678.2200000000003
until that point where they suddenly

2676.3 --> 2680.44
drop off yeah

2678.22 --> 2683.68
but that's because the line of sight is

2680.44 --> 2685.42
getting cut off and that oil platform is

2683.68 --> 2688.72
right on the edge of it and then it

2685.42 --> 2690.28
seems like it's just falling behind that

2688.72 --> 2692.56
curve

2690.28 --> 2695.02
doesn't compart to any actual Earth

2692.56 --> 2697.06
geometry though of a sphere

2695.02 --> 2698.44
but you could definitely think of it

2697.06 --> 2699.52
like that

2698.44 --> 2704.14
right

2699.52 --> 2705.819
what it does not do though is prove the

2704.14 --> 2709.3799999999997
Earth is a sphere

2705.819 --> 2709.38
it doesn't prove that

2714.819 --> 2721.2
oh yeah let them squirt

2717.94 --> 2721.2000000000003
and it's all fine

2727.48 --> 2731.94
you're a puddle of blood dude

2733.96 --> 2741.599
I'm gonna call you True Blood puddle

2738.099 --> 2741.599
because that's what you are

2743.98 --> 2748.18
hey steamy Traveler

2745.9 --> 2750.3
see you in seeking Star Wars good to see

2748.18 --> 2750.2999999999997
you

2754.839 --> 2757.38
so

2758.04 --> 2765.3
yeah I mean it's just yeah but yeah

2762.819 --> 2769.14
everything I just explained is really

2765.3 --> 2769.1400000000003
correct and consistent

2773.44 --> 2776.88
okay Aries

2779.14 --> 2784.54
oh unemployment under the studio okay

2781.96 --> 2787.26
well then [ __ ] off [ __ ]

2784.54 --> 2790.8
you're just gonna add home

2787.26 --> 2795.6400000000003
I know it's very triggering when I

2790.8 --> 2799.6600000000003
meticulously explain exactly

2795.64 --> 2802.24
how Optics works yeah what what

2799.66 --> 2803.92
refraction is what it actually is what

2802.24 --> 2806.9799999999996
it can't be

2803.92 --> 2810.7000000000003
how that works yeah I didn't use any map

2806.98 --> 2814.54
I just used words describing things and

2810.7 --> 2815.9199999999996
examples kept it clear and consistent

2814.54 --> 2817.66
yes

2815.92 --> 2820.839
huh

2817.66 --> 2823.42
explain to you what happens when you see

2820.839 --> 2825.64
things and when you don't see it exactly

2823.42 --> 2827.8
how that works yeah line aside oh you

2825.64 --> 2829.5989999999997
can see more oh I can't see more oh it's

2827.8 --> 2831.46
almost like it's falling over the edge

2829.599 --> 2833.38
there yeah it's not consistent with

2831.46 --> 2836.28
globe geometry though

2833.38 --> 2836.28
ah

2837.839 --> 2843.7
besides you only need one Black Swan

2841.24 --> 2846.22
observation to disprove the ball

2843.7 --> 2850.06
geometry and we have tons of them

2846.22 --> 2852.9399999999996
everywhere and bendy cranes

2850.06 --> 2854.98
definitely doesn't undo the Black Swan

2852.94 --> 2858.04
arguments yeah

2854.98 --> 2861.16
because you are feeble

2858.04 --> 2863.14
pitiful attempts to invoke terrestrial

2861.16 --> 2865.54
refraction

2863.14 --> 2867.16
just calling in refraction because it

2865.54 --> 2869.5
isn't refracted it's not the same thing

2867.16 --> 2871.359
you see terrestrial refraction is a

2869.5 --> 2876.16
mathematical concept

2871.359 --> 2878.5
that requires the radius value within it

2876.16 --> 2880.7799999999997
7 over 6r

2878.5 --> 2883.359
yeah it's a mathematical concept that

2880.78 --> 2884.98
has nothing to do with actual Optics and

2883.359 --> 2887.5
that's the thing you're trying to invoke

2884.98 --> 2890.26
every time bendy cranes are brought up

2887.5 --> 2892.66
in relation to a Black Swan observations

2890.26 --> 2895.3
because you think

2892.66 --> 2896.92
in your magical thinking little corner

2895.3 --> 2901.42
of your mind

2896.92 --> 2904.119
that invoking that justifies why the

2901.42 --> 2907.599
geometry of globe Earth has been utterly

2904.119 --> 2909.7000000000003
violated every time you see that and

2907.599 --> 2912.1600000000003
there's no justification for it except

2909.7 --> 2915.64
oh it's all magical bendy stuff is

2912.16 --> 2918.339
magical R refraction that just rip it

2915.64 --> 2921.0989999999997
just makes it look flat I mean there's

2918.339 --> 2923.38
absolutely no possible way to ever

2921.099 --> 2925.48
demonstrate any of that like with

2923.38 --> 2928.119
Miniatures right I mean you can't

2925.48 --> 2932.02
actually do that because terrestrial

2928.119 --> 2935.38
refraction yeah it requires continual

2932.02 --> 2937.78
changing of the mediums yeah

2935.38 --> 2939.52
requires like oh you start really thin

2937.78 --> 2942.0400000000004
oh you get a thicker medium you get an

2939.52 --> 2944.74
even thicker medium then you get an even

2942.04 --> 2946.96
sicker medium and then even and

2944.74 --> 2948.2799999999997
eventually there's literally you

2946.96 --> 2949.18
wouldn't be able to see through it

2948.28 --> 2952.0600000000004
anymore

2949.18 --> 2954.16
but until that point yeah it could look

2952.06 --> 2956.2599999999998
sort of spherical like it could make it

2954.16 --> 2959.859
look like that you could make it look

2956.26 --> 2962.1600000000003
flat on a spherical surface you you

2959.859 --> 2967.359
could do that but you would require

2962.16 --> 2970.66
continual alterations of mediums

2967.359 --> 2972.339
by the surface yeah not horizontal like

2970.66 --> 2973.72
what we could have

2972.339 --> 2977.319
right

2973.72 --> 2981.04
because the gases ground level are much

2977.319 --> 2982.72
thicker much more dense on average then

2981.04 --> 2985.359
the gas is high up right so that you

2982.72 --> 2988.06
could say oh there's sort of a gradation

2985.359 --> 2990.22
and then you could say yeah the probably

2988.06 --> 2992.0789999999997
the refraction up there is different

2990.22 --> 2994.66
from the refraction down here because

2992.079 --> 2998.2000000000003
it's much thicker air here so

2994.66 --> 3001.98
that's a horizontal division isn't it

2998.2 --> 3006.18
it's not a vertical division which is

3001.98 --> 3011.04
what you would absolutely require

3006.18 --> 3013.98
to create a bending around the corner

3011.04 --> 3018.14
in a spherical shape

3013.98 --> 3021.54
visual in order to make it look

3018.14 --> 3024.06
completely flat like that from that side

3021.54 --> 3027.18
yeah

3024.06 --> 3029.339
to make it look flat when it's in

3027.18 --> 3033.1189999999997
actually over straight you would need

3029.339 --> 3036.24
continual vertical segments that were

3033.119 --> 3039.6600000000003
completely more dense and more dense as

3036.24 --> 3041.7599999999998
you went in order to look at the side of

3039.66 --> 3043.7999999999997
that through it all

3041.76 --> 3046.92
and make it look somewhat flat well

3043.8 --> 3049.94
guess what we don't live in a world

3046.92 --> 3052.6800000000003
where we're surrounded by different

3049.94 --> 3054.839
segments of density that are ever

3052.68 --> 3057.9199999999996
increasing in all directions which is

3054.839 --> 3057.92
illogical anyway

3058.2 --> 3064.3799999999997
in order to make terrestrial refraction

3061.2 --> 3067.4399999999996
actually possible it isn't possible it's

3064.38 --> 3070.339
just a mathematical concept and it has

3067.44 --> 3073.88
the radius value

3070.339 --> 3073.88
within it

3076.859 --> 3084.42
and there's no justification for that

3081.0 --> 3087.24
because the effect the actual effects of

3084.42 --> 3091.319
refraction within Optics have absolutely

3087.24 --> 3094.3799999999997
nothing to do with any radial value

3091.319 --> 3099.0589999999997
at all the only thing refraction

3094.38 --> 3103.6800000000003
involves is the transition of light

3099.059 --> 3106.44
from one medium to another

3103.68 --> 3109.74
and then

3106.44 --> 3114.2000000000003
the angle of approach and the angle of

3109.74 --> 3118.5
the exit is altered that's refraction

3114.2 --> 3121.0789999999997
and that is the only thing that

3118.5 --> 3124.14
refraction actually is

3121.079 --> 3125.4
yeah that's the only way it is doing

3124.14 --> 3128.18
something

3125.4 --> 3128.1800000000003
do you understand

3129.3 --> 3138.059
so terrestrial refraction is a myth

3133.98 --> 3141.9
it's Science Fiction it's

3138.059 --> 3145.559
probably Jesuit in origin conception a

3141.9 --> 3148.4
mathematical ball Earth conception like

3145.559 --> 3148.4
so much of it

3150.02 --> 3153.74
hello here we go again

3161.7 --> 3167.7799999999997
what the hell

3164.16 --> 3167.7799999999997
you're talking about like young

3174.72 --> 3179.3999999999996
looking to convince a couple of doubtful

3177.3 --> 3181.1400000000003
Bodies In The Flat Earth what would be

3179.4 --> 3183.599
the best proof

3181.14 --> 3186.359
okay stock Visa B

3183.599 --> 3187.7400000000002
uh the housekeeping questions all of

3186.359 --> 3190.2
them

3187.74 --> 3192.4399999999996
right the Flat Earth debate housekeeping

3190.2 --> 3192.4399999999996
questions

3192.48 --> 3196.02
they are the best they are the best

3194.339 --> 3197.88
arguments like you can't have gas

3196.02 --> 3199.98
pressure without a container Earth can

3197.88 --> 3202.859
be a ball in an open outer space that's

3199.98 --> 3205.04
almost infinite the gas we have here

3202.859 --> 3208.5589999999997
would immediately vacate

3205.04 --> 3212.819
instantaneously with a violent explosive

3208.559 --> 3215.4
force that's absolutely Unstoppable

3212.819 --> 3217.92
in all directions in order to average

3215.4 --> 3220.559
out with the available volume of

3217.92 --> 3223.38
Infinite Space yeah that's a good

3220.559 --> 3226.02
starter to convince anybody that the

3223.38 --> 3229.26
Earth is not a ball in outer space

3226.02 --> 3232.14
and the flatness well you have to buy to

3229.26 --> 3234.42
the Black Swan argument

3232.14 --> 3237.7999999999997
everything I just explained I mean it's

3234.42 --> 3237.8
not super easy though

3238.14 --> 3243.92
it was a bit of a chore explaining it

3240.48 --> 3248.0
all wasn't it it took me like 10 minutes

3243.92 --> 3248.0
it's not super easy

3248.04 --> 3253.02
there's a lot of things you need to

3250.319 --> 3254.4
realize about Optics about what actual

3253.02 --> 3257.88
refraction is

3254.4 --> 3260.04
in order to identify how terrestrial

3257.88 --> 3262.52
refraction is a completely fictional

3260.04 --> 3262.52
mechanism

3266.92 --> 3271.02
[Music]

3268.38 --> 3273.9
right yeah coriolis yeah you could argue

3271.02 --> 3275.94
about coriolis but still it gets very

3273.9 --> 3279.2400000000002
convoluted too

3275.94 --> 3280.98
because the way Coriolis effect in the

3279.24 --> 3284.64
globe Earth model

3280.98 --> 3288.18
is forwarded even in Wikipedia

3284.64 --> 3289.7999999999997
is really weirdly deceptive because it

3288.18 --> 3292.14
actually doesn't have anything to do

3289.8 --> 3295.559
with Coriolis effect you see Coriolis

3292.14 --> 3297.42
effect is exclusively an apparent

3295.559 --> 3301.7400000000002
deviation

3297.42 --> 3306.0
because of a different reference frame

3301.74 --> 3308.22
some it's like you're moving but you

3306.0 --> 3311.339
have no perception of that

3308.22 --> 3313.2
something else seems to be moving to you

3311.339 --> 3315.359
but it is actually you that is moving

3313.2 --> 3317.2799999999997
and that thing is standing still that's

3315.359 --> 3319.38
the Coriolis effect it's an apparent

3317.28 --> 3320.7000000000003
deviation

3319.38 --> 3323.28
right

3320.7 --> 3326.52
that's not going on here on Earth

3323.28 --> 3331.26
but this is what they did they they

3326.52 --> 3334.88
reversed it around they what uh

3331.26 --> 3336.96
what Brian Brian's logic like called

3334.88 --> 3339.42
globios I think it's a very good name

3336.96 --> 3342.119
that's what's happened globial this has

3339.42 --> 3344.52
happened and that is a globiolis is an

3342.119 --> 3348.599
actual deviation

3344.52 --> 3350.04
that is claimed to be caused by spinning

3348.599 --> 3354.3
ball Earth

3350.04 --> 3356.52
and that's preposterous so tornadoes are

3354.3 --> 3360.42
claimed to be caused by Coriolis effect

3356.52 --> 3363.66
when tornadoes are a literal deviation

3360.42 --> 3366.599
not an apparent deviation they're not

3363.66 --> 3368.7
they don't appear to be going in a

3366.599 --> 3371.339
circle thrashing things now they

3368.7 --> 3373.5589999999997
actually go in a circle trashing things

3371.339 --> 3376.98
yeah

3373.559 --> 3380.1600000000003
let that be perfectly clear

3376.98 --> 3383.16
a tornado is not Coriolis effect now if

3380.16 --> 3384.42
you get stuck in the tornado if you

3383.16 --> 3386.2799999999997
survive that

3384.42 --> 3388.6800000000003
and you can still see something around

3386.28 --> 3391.619
you you don't get your eyes poked out

3388.68 --> 3393.4199999999996
then you might fly around in there and

3391.619 --> 3396.2400000000002
then see like whoa there's this house

3393.42 --> 3398.46
coming for me oh wait I passed it oh

3396.24 --> 3400.7999999999997
it's coming back again whoa but it's

3398.46 --> 3402.839
actually you that is moving in the house

3400.8 --> 3404.579
that somehow didn't get trashed is

3402.839 --> 3407.16
standing still

3404.579 --> 3409.8
beneath you and you almost keep flying

3407.16 --> 3411.359
into it yeah now that's coriolis

3409.8 --> 3413.579
deviation

3411.359 --> 3415.5
you thought that the house is moving

3413.579 --> 3418.7400000000002
towards you but it's you that's actually

3415.5 --> 3422.46
moving towards the house that's coriolis

3418.74 --> 3425.5989999999997
yeah the storm and that it moves in a

3422.46 --> 3428.819
circle and that it might go east or west

3425.599 --> 3431.7000000000003
on on your presupposed sphere

3428.819 --> 3435.42
on Earth basically has absolutely

3431.7 --> 3438.66
nothing to do with coriolis deviation

3435.42 --> 3440.88
yet it has been officially put

3438.66 --> 3443.2799999999997
everywhere this is Korea

3440.88 --> 3446.04
all the water in the toy that goes in

3443.28 --> 3447.5400000000004
circle that proves coriolis that proves

3446.04 --> 3450.0
to the Earth is a ball that's spinning

3447.54 --> 3451.8
oh and a tornado it moves like that oh

3450.0 --> 3453.48
yeah the proofs that there is a ball

3451.8 --> 3455.76
spitting yeah that's what they say it's

3453.48 --> 3460.7400000000002
complete horseshit

3455.76 --> 3465.0
it's literally a parlor trick lie a to

3460.74 --> 3468.72
your face parlor trick lie yeah choreos

3465.0 --> 3470.22
effect is not an actual deviation that's

3468.72 --> 3474.7799999999997
caused by anything

3470.22 --> 3478.3799999999997
Coriolis effect is an apparent deviation

3474.78 --> 3481.3190000000004
yeah so anything that's spinning right

3478.38 --> 3482.94
in front of you is not going to be a

3481.319 --> 3484.2599999999998
Coriolis effect

3482.94 --> 3487.44
ever

3484.26 --> 3489.6600000000003
do you understand Universal something is

3487.44 --> 3491.579
spinning in front of you doesn't matter

3489.66 --> 3496.68
what it is

3491.579 --> 3500.3390000000004
that's never Coriolis effect right

3496.68 --> 3503.8799999999997
unless that spinning is a thing at the

3500.339 --> 3505.859
middle of a merry-go-round that's

3503.88 --> 3507.599
standing still and you're sitting on the

3505.859 --> 3509.52
Merry-Go-Round watching as it is

3507.599 --> 3512.04
spinning in front of you now then it's

3509.52 --> 3514.8
Coriolis effect because it's you that's

3512.04 --> 3516.54
actually spinning around that thing in

3514.8 --> 3517.98
the middle of the Merry-Go-Round that's

3516.54 --> 3520.2599999999998
sitting still

3517.98 --> 3524.04
but that's not happening yeah

3520.26 --> 3527.6400000000003
the Earth is definitely not rotating

3524.04 --> 3530.4
around your toilet flush

3527.64 --> 3534.96
and if the Earth is definitely not

3530.4 --> 3538.26
rotating around the still sitting circle

3534.96 --> 3542.52
of a tornado yeah

3538.26 --> 3545.1600000000003
definitely not the Coriolis deviation

3542.52 --> 3547.559
that's happening because of Earth spin

3545.16 --> 3549.96
but people don't seem to realize that if

3547.559 --> 3552.42
you claim oh the tornadoes because of

3549.96 --> 3555.0
coriolo's deviation okay well then

3552.42 --> 3559.76
tornadoes can only happen at the North

3555.0 --> 3559.76
and South Pole then you dumbass

3561.059 --> 3567.299
because if they're anywhere else well

3564.72 --> 3568.799
then it's definitely just something

3567.299 --> 3571.02
that's spinning

3568.799 --> 3574.819
and not the Earth spinning underneath so

3571.02 --> 3574.819
it's not coriolis deviation

3575.339 --> 3581.24
so yeah that might be helpful

3578.099 --> 3581.2400000000002
to as a pointer

3584.28 --> 3590.1800000000003
the pendulum swings are the pendulums

3587.22 --> 3592.5
folk called pendulum

3590.18 --> 3594.1189999999997
yeah the pendulum is even more

3592.5 --> 3596.28
ridiculous I mean the pendulum is

3594.119 --> 3599.04
literally just oh

3596.28 --> 3601.3190000000004
I have a pendulum I'm gonna swing it in

3599.04 --> 3605.46
front of you now look at the pendulum

3601.319 --> 3607.74
look as it is actually the earth that is

3605.46 --> 3609.96
spinning underneath the pendulum oh look

3607.74 --> 3612.0
at the pendulum oh I'm not hypnotizing

3609.96 --> 3614.04
you at all the Earth is spinning

3612.0 --> 3615.9
underneath now look at the pendulum as

3614.04 --> 3617.94
it swings and imagine how the Earth is

3615.9 --> 3621.2000000000003
spinning underneath oh it's not a

3617.94 --> 3621.2000000000003
hypnotic trick at all

3628.799 --> 3631.799
foreign

3646.799 --> 3649.819
that's a funny name

3651.059 --> 3656.6400000000003
we move and the Pendulum stays put

3654.599 --> 3659.4
yes

3656.64 --> 3661.98
it's it's mostly about just you thinking

3659.4 --> 3664.619
of the Earth as a ball and the Pendulum

3661.98 --> 3668.22
is just swinging and then just imagining

3664.619 --> 3670.619
how the ball is moving that's it it's

3668.22 --> 3673.98
just look at the pendulum swinging get

3670.619 --> 3677.04
hypnotized and now get deep in your mind

3673.98 --> 3680.28
a visualization of how the Earth is

3677.04 --> 3682.619
spinning that's it that's literally what

3680.28 --> 3684.8390000000004
the focal pendulum is just look at the

3682.619 --> 3686.579
pendulum and imagine how the Earth is

3684.839 --> 3688.5589999999997
spinning underneath

3686.579 --> 3691.079
and that's all it is it's just a

3688.559 --> 3694.799
hypnotic trick to indoctrinate you in

3691.079 --> 3698.6600000000003
earth spin believe nonsense

3694.799 --> 3698.66
focal no no no no

3705.16 --> 3708.219
[Music]

3714.359 --> 3720.5589999999997
do I consider myself a physics expert

3717.299 --> 3720.559
yeah a bit

3723.72 --> 3731.64
but I'm very practical with my physics

3727.2 --> 3735.4199999999996
so I am like I'm basically an anti-math

3731.64 --> 3737.94
physics physicist like I do not like

3735.42 --> 3739.7400000000002
math I do not apply math I do everything

3737.94 --> 3742.38
explained

3739.74 --> 3744.9799999999996
everything it's all about the

3742.38 --> 3744.98
explanation

3746.64 --> 3752.0589999999997
and demonstration if I'd have the

3749.22 --> 3752.0589999999997
ability

3752.099 --> 3757.38
if I had like a class an object to

3755.099 --> 3760.2000000000003
demonstrate sure I do that that would be

3757.38 --> 3762.839
pretty cool I don't though

3760.2 --> 3764.9399999999996
I just have my little room that is the

3762.839 --> 3767.18
same room in which I eat dinner and I

3764.94 --> 3770.96
sleep

3767.18 --> 3770.96
and that's all I got

3774.66 --> 3779.0989999999997
physicist well there are [ __ ] math

3776.94 --> 3781.52
physicists and they suck

3779.099 --> 3784.2000000000003
they're just whining to you about stupid

3781.52 --> 3787.2599999999998
presuppositional nonsense formulas math

3784.2 --> 3788.64
physicists suck I'm sorry there might be

3787.26 --> 3791.5200000000004
some out there that are really awesome

3788.64 --> 3795.54
but those that are really awesome they

3791.52 --> 3797.94
really know how to not make it into one

3795.54 --> 3800.4
thing they know to keep their math apart

3797.94 --> 3802.44
from the physics right those are good

3800.4 --> 3805.319
those are good but the ones that are

3802.44 --> 3809.76
like oh no math is reality [ __ ] them

3805.319 --> 3813.0589999999997
they're like astrophysicists they suck

3809.76 --> 3815.6400000000003
they conjure nonsense into reality in

3813.059 --> 3817.6800000000003
their minds using math it's [ __ ]

3815.64 --> 3820.16
pathetic

3817.68 --> 3823.39
right and they're always in with

3820.16 --> 3826.6099999999997
presuppositional [ __ ]

3823.39 --> 3826.6099999999997
[Music]

3828.24 --> 3835.799
so yeah you can have good physicists and

3832.44 --> 3837.54
mathematicians if they really know to

3835.799 --> 3839.46
keep it apart it's like this is what

3837.54 --> 3842.4
makes it physics this is what makes it

3839.46 --> 3844.38
math if they can keep that apart really

3842.4 --> 3847.44
well then they're probably [ __ ]

3844.38 --> 3850.619
awesome and great teachers

3847.44 --> 3853.28
they don't they [ __ ] suck and they're

3850.619 --> 3853.28
delusional

3853.74 --> 3856.22
foreign

3861.57 --> 3868.52
[Music]

3863.119 --> 3868.52
like astrophysicists most of them are

3874.859 --> 3877.68
but can

3876.119 --> 3881.059
I don't know if it can blue build

3877.68 --> 3881.0589999999997
Evolution I have no idea

3886.819 --> 3891.5589999999997
what are my thoughts on theoretical

3889.38 --> 3895.859
physicists

3891.559 --> 3895.8590000000004
physicists okay uh

3896.46 --> 3902.099
I think most of them are a complete

3899.339 --> 3904.74
waste of time and energy because they're

3902.099 --> 3906.9
all about the presuppositional [ __ ]

3904.74 --> 3909.0589999999997
reifications

3906.9 --> 3912.599
they're all working on [ __ ]

3909.059 --> 3916.38
reifications none of them

3912.599 --> 3918.42
are ever allowed to even like not

3916.38 --> 3921.5
presupposable earth

3918.42 --> 3921.5
it's pathetic

3923.28 --> 3929.1600000000003
like in it technically you could say I'm

3926.819 --> 3930.66
a theoretical physicist

3929.16 --> 3933.319
but

3930.66 --> 3937.0789999999997
I

3933.319 --> 3940.5589999999997
don't have a paper degree I don't have a

3937.079 --> 3942.6600000000003
job in it officially and that's why I

3940.559 --> 3946.3190000000004
can [ __ ] tell the truth that's why I

3942.66 --> 3949.02
don't have to be a [ __ ] up baltard

3946.319 --> 3953.7
and I can just literally just no I'm

3949.02 --> 3955.559
just gonna do it the way it's real

3953.7 --> 3957.54
I'm just gonna do it and you can't

3955.559 --> 3960.299
[ __ ] stop me and you can't [ __ ]

3957.54 --> 3963.0589999999997
peer pressure me away and hold up all

3960.299 --> 3965.22
your papers and like oh look at my

3963.059 --> 3967.619
degrees or look at all the money I make

3965.22 --> 3970.3799999999997
yeah look at how you get everything

3967.619 --> 3973.7400000000002
wrong and how you're a [ __ ] ball tart

3970.38 --> 3977.04
I'd rather die than have your money in

3973.74 --> 3980.2799999999997
your papers and your status than to be

3977.04 --> 3983.4
you I'd rather die

3980.28 --> 3986.6400000000003
I don't want your crap all I want is to

3983.4 --> 3988.92
be able to be absolutely mercilessly be

3986.64 --> 3991.2799999999997
able to tell the truth no matter the

3988.92 --> 3991.28
cost

3991.799 --> 3999.2599999999998
yeah

3994.559 --> 3999.26
and I do that's exactly what I do here

4001.839 --> 4006.92
I don't want any [ __ ] titles I don't

4005.18 --> 4009.5
want any any

4006.92 --> 4013.46
big check money

4009.5 --> 4016.46
yeah it's all bribe money all of it yeah

4013.46 --> 4019.88
all of it is bribe money

4016.46 --> 4022.339
bright money to make you hold on to the

4019.88 --> 4024.559
lie so that you don't become a threat to

4022.339 --> 4027.859
this [ __ ] up system

4024.559 --> 4030.799
that's just drowning in lights

4027.859 --> 4032.42
I'm not part of that

4030.799 --> 4036.319
I'm free

4032.42 --> 4037.88
I have a free mind I have a free spirit

4036.319 --> 4040.46
either

4037.88 --> 4043.819
a lot of training in this because I've

4040.46 --> 4046.039
literally never given it up in my life

4043.819 --> 4048.2599999999998
even though a lot of people encouraged

4046.039 --> 4050.6600000000003
me to and I was seduced to basically

4048.26 --> 4052.28
give it up a lot I even tried to give it

4050.66 --> 4055.22
up when I was younger and then found

4052.28 --> 4058.039
myself completely incapable of doing so

4055.22 --> 4062.859
because I would start to want to kill

4058.039 --> 4062.8590000000004
myself if I actually tried that

4064.16 --> 4068.68
I have to be this I have to be free

4068.9 --> 4075.319
I have to be this way I have to do it

4072.38 --> 4077.42
free and I have to go my way and nothing

4075.319 --> 4080.72
will stop me

4077.42 --> 4083.0
because if it does I cast It Off

4080.72 --> 4086.4199999999996
I will not be stopped

4083.0 --> 4088.64
I will not be stopped and thankfully

4086.42 --> 4091.4
YouTube doesn't really seem to be super

4088.64 --> 4094.839
eager to stop me either even though they

4091.4 --> 4094.839
gave gate me down

4095.9 --> 4101.06
but I don't mind it's like oh I get it

4098.42 --> 4104.2390000000005
down okay well then only the people that

4101.06 --> 4105.14
really care are gonna find me and watch

4104.239 --> 4107.599999999999
me

4105.14 --> 4110.54
and I bet that there's like a lot of

4107.6 --> 4112.6990000000005
them that really do find me and watch me

4110.54 --> 4114.799
that kind of keep in the background I

4112.699 --> 4116.719
get unexpected like oh hey dude I'm a

4114.799 --> 4118.16
big fan and that I can feel that it's

4116.719 --> 4122.12
real

4118.16 --> 4124.58
like plenty of times so there's like a

4122.12 --> 4127.5199999999995
lot more people watching than those few

4124.58 --> 4129.62
hundred that are the few hundred views

4127.52 --> 4132.9400000000005
although

4129.62 --> 4132.94
you gotta be honest

4135.739 --> 4142.4
it might literally be those numbers

4139.219 --> 4146.12
like it might be that my viewing numbers

4142.4 --> 4147.879999999999
are actually the real numbers where some

4146.12 --> 4150.14
other channels that have supposedly

4147.88 --> 4152.779
millions of viewers

4150.14 --> 4154.759
actually don't have millions of viewers

4152.779 --> 4158.120000000001
at all

4154.759 --> 4163.0
and that a large percentage of those

4158.12 --> 4163.0
Channel followers are completely Bots

4163.759 --> 4168.259
so I'm pretty damn sure that the people

4166.46 --> 4170.2390000000005
that watch me are all real people

4168.259 --> 4172.4
because if they're not I immediately

4170.239 --> 4174.98
kick them the [ __ ] out

4172.4 --> 4177.679
yeah I don't want Bots I don't want

4174.98 --> 4179.7789999999995
trolls I want real people Dynamic people

4177.679 --> 4181.16
that can learn

4179.779 --> 4186.339000000001
and that can

4181.16 --> 4186.339
help out financially or intellectually

4188.359 --> 4193.1
right

4190.04 --> 4194.9
and I think that all my followers are

4193.1 --> 4197.4800000000005
real people

4194.9 --> 4200.0
except for the trolls

4197.48 --> 4202.28
but there's plenty of viewers that are

4200.0 --> 4204.199
all real and now compare that to you

4202.28 --> 4205.94
channels how many of those viewers are

4204.199 --> 4207.919999999999
actually real

4205.94 --> 4211.16
I think the big difference is is that

4207.92 --> 4214.58
they basically don't add numbers onto us

4211.16 --> 4217.94
they don't promotion might simply not

4214.58 --> 4221.42
even be as much gatekeeping as like they

4217.94 --> 4224.54
just pile on a fake audience on people

4221.42 --> 4227.9
that YouTube basically once promoted I

4224.54 --> 4230.12
think it's that I think it's just a fake

4227.9 --> 4232.42
audience that's just being maneuvered

4230.12 --> 4234.98
for political social engineering

4232.42 --> 4236.4800000000005
manipulation I think that that's what's

4234.98 --> 4238.639999999999
actually happening I don't even think

4236.48 --> 4241.159
that those million viewer channels

4238.64 --> 4244.6
actually have a million viewers I don't

4241.159 --> 4244.599999999999
think it that that's real

4246.8 --> 4251.42
so

4248.239 --> 4254.739
I'm very happy with the real people

4251.42 --> 4254.7390000000005
that follow my show

4255.1 --> 4259.06
that give me real support

4269.3 --> 4275.42
right so yeah I mean my what is it now

4273.26 --> 4279.5
1300

4275.42 --> 4282.62
something how many subscribers do I have

4279.5 --> 4284.199
oh wait I have a lot more

4282.62 --> 4287.179
2

4284.199 --> 4289.299999999999
740 or something that's what it is right

4287.179 --> 4289.3
now

4290.54 --> 4297.76
47 2747.

4294.199 --> 4297.759999999999
yeah I think that

4298.58 --> 4304.699
that most of them are real real people

4302.239 --> 4307.759999999999
that really watch

4304.699 --> 4309.739
a lot of them will still be like people

4307.76 --> 4311.96
that basically were watching and that

4309.739 --> 4314.86
kind of stopped they just gave up on

4311.96 --> 4314.86
YouTube or something

4329.179 --> 4332.14
right anyway

4335.659 --> 4342.08
what's the talk hater 306

4338.9 --> 4343.219
yeah we're taught I was talking earlier

4342.08 --> 4345.28
about

4343.219 --> 4348.26
I started out with George Sanford

4345.28 --> 4351.38
actually having the goal to say bendy

4348.26 --> 4354.56
cranes in response to flatter to

4351.38 --> 4357.32
relax one argument that got me kind of

4354.56 --> 4359.780000000001
pissed off I remained that pissed off I

4357.32 --> 4361.759999999999
will not forget about this I mean that

4359.78 --> 4364.46
was really like one of the dumbest

4361.76 --> 4368.7390000000005
things he could have ever done

4364.46 --> 4368.7390000000005
I I lost some respect for him

4370.46 --> 4375.02
because now he's not only a Debbie

4372.32 --> 4377.9
Downer he's also a ball [ __ ] argument

4375.02 --> 4380.120000000001
echoer when he's not even a baller it's

4377.9 --> 4383.36
unbelievably [ __ ]

4380.12 --> 4385.699
that is doing that and so I laid it down

4383.36 --> 4389.259999999999
completely why

4385.699 --> 4389.259999999999
The Armenian paradox

4391.28 --> 4397.0
why

4392.719 --> 4397.0
refraction is not a rebuttal

4402.5 --> 4406.42
who what George Sanford

4428.48 --> 4433.04
George can be great yeah it can be a

4430.159 --> 4435.92
real Debbie Downer but I mean

4433.04 --> 4438.86
that's just his personality then I guess

4435.92 --> 4441.92
I don't mind that I could even forgive

4438.86 --> 4445.04
that he's a dumbass concave which in my

4441.92 --> 4447.86
view is literally underneath a baller

4445.04 --> 4450.92
yeah you heard it yeah concave is

4447.86 --> 4454.5199999999995
underneath a baller and I can argue that

4450.92 --> 4456.5
can absolutely argue that and I do I

4454.52 --> 4459.26
just usually don't need to because most

4456.5 --> 4461.78
concavers are literally religious

4459.26 --> 4464.42
[ __ ] they're religious about it and

4461.78 --> 4467.08
they have no argument they're just a

4464.42 --> 4467.08
[ __ ] cult

4467.179 --> 4473.0
concavors are actual cultists

4470.659 --> 4476.599999999999
they act like cultists

4473.0 --> 4480.739
they have no argumentation whatsoever

4476.6 --> 4483.320000000001
like zero argumentation there's no

4480.739 --> 4486.5
mechanical logical backing behind

4483.32 --> 4490.159
concave reasoning at all yeah

4486.5 --> 4493.219
I mean ball tards have some [ __ ]

4490.159 --> 4495.679
baltart math [ __ ] reasoning that all

4493.219 --> 4496.96
breaks apart but at least they have some

4495.679 --> 4500.06
reasoning

4496.96 --> 4502.64
concavors don't even have any reasoning

4500.06 --> 4504.9800000000005
it's just no it's just like this like

4502.64 --> 4507.88
okay then you're just [ __ ] [ __ ]

4504.98 --> 4507.879999999999
fine

4507.92 --> 4514.64
just don't keep whining about it

4510.98 --> 4518.659
right and so he hasn't but now in my

4514.64 --> 4521.42
chat he responded to Black Swan when I

4518.659 --> 4524.719
said that in relation to something with

4521.42 --> 4530.9
Benny cranes and that's just like no

4524.719 --> 4532.34
no you can't be a concave idiot zealot

4530.9 --> 4535.099999999999
cultist

4532.34 --> 4539.860000000001
and then actually use ball tart

4535.1 --> 4539.860000000001
rebuttals you can't be serious

4540.5 --> 4547.84
so I berated him over that

4544.52 --> 4547.84
here on the show

4548.06 --> 4553.1
and told him he should be ashamed of

4549.86 --> 4555.08
himself and he probably is right now he

4553.1 --> 4556.9400000000005
definitely should like that was like one

4555.08 --> 4559.159
of the most embarrassing [ __ ] things

4556.94 --> 4562.639999999999
he could have ever done

4559.159 --> 4567.679
yeah use a ball [ __ ] argument

4562.64 --> 4569.96
like that like that's Sean Hawkins level

4567.679 --> 4573.4400000000005
when you catch yourself saying bendy

4569.96 --> 4575.7390000000005
cranes in response to Black Swan you're

4573.44 --> 4579.259999999999
Sean Hawkins now

4575.739 --> 4582.739
it's that stupid

4579.26 --> 4583.6990000000005
although yeah it's almost that stupid I

4582.739 --> 4586.218999999999
mean

4583.699 --> 4588.919999999999
you to actually be that stupid you'd

4586.219 --> 4590.36
have to say why do the stars rotate in a

4588.92 --> 4593.54
different direction in the southern

4590.36 --> 4596.659
hemisphere right then your proper Sean

4593.54 --> 4599.179
Hawkins [ __ ] [ __ ] but

4596.659 --> 4602.36
yeah it's not that bad yeah but it is

4599.179 --> 4604.6990000000005
getting there so it's really [ __ ]

4602.36 --> 4607.04
stupid to say that oh he's back it seems

4604.699 --> 4609.379999999999
and I berated him for that and then

4607.04 --> 4611.659
somebody asked me like what are

4609.38 --> 4614.179
I got somebody like on the fence with

4611.659 --> 4616.219
flat Earth what are good arguments to

4614.179 --> 4619.179
make and so I went into the housekeeping

4616.219 --> 4619.179
questions for a bit

4619.28 --> 4624.5599999999995
started with gas pressure without a

4621.32 --> 4626.739
container very quick quick to deal with

4624.56 --> 4626.7390000000005
that

4626.96 --> 4632.84
and uh Coriolis effect

4630.199 --> 4636.5
that's where we ended up as my family

4632.84 --> 4640.159000000001
sure I don't give a [ __ ] but yeah my dad

4636.5 --> 4642.62
definitely knows the Earth is not a ball

4640.159 --> 4644.96
and he's even on with me that the

4642.62 --> 4648.0199999999995
celestials are holographic

4644.96 --> 4650.26
so yeah my dad's pretty much supporting

4648.02 --> 4653.8
me in my Cosmo

4650.26 --> 4653.8
cosmoginy insights

4655.699 --> 4660.62
and the other family I don't know I

4658.76 --> 4662.84
don't think they care

4660.62 --> 4665.599999999999
my brother never cared about this kind

4662.84 --> 4666.8
of stuff he never did he did care about

4665.6 --> 4668.719
physics

4666.8 --> 4671.719
but he does not care about supposed

4668.719 --> 4675.56
shape of Earth at all and he like he

4671.719 --> 4678.86
genuinely like with with poisonous hate

4675.56 --> 4680.06
hates [ __ ] ball Tarts and flat

4678.86 --> 4683.0599999999995
earthers

4680.06 --> 4685.159000000001
like he hates that a lot

4683.06 --> 4686.4800000000005
he hates the bickering he hates the bad

4685.159 --> 4687.92
behavior

4686.48 --> 4689.9
he hates it he doesn't want to have

4687.92 --> 4692.96
anything to do with that

4689.9 --> 4695.299999999999
and I think that he doesn't really have

4692.96 --> 4697.4800000000005
a very well developed position within it

4695.3 --> 4697.4800000000005
even

4698.9 --> 4704.239
so I've never been I don't remember ever

4702.08 --> 4705.38
having an actual discussion with him

4704.239 --> 4706.759999999999
about it

4705.38 --> 4710.4800000000005
ever

4706.76 --> 4712.9400000000005
and if such things would be brought up

4710.48 --> 4715.04
then he would like leave he would leave

4712.94 --> 4716.9
the room if my family started talking

4715.04 --> 4718.28
about it

4716.9 --> 4720.139999999999
he hates it

4718.28 --> 4722.599999999999
so I don't even know what his position

4720.14 --> 4724.400000000001
is I don't know if he cares he might be

4722.6 --> 4726.9800000000005
like like

4724.4 --> 4730.28
what do you call that

4726.98 --> 4732.759999999999
he might be a bitter agnostic when it

4730.28 --> 4732.759999999999
comes to

4732.88 --> 4737.06
cosmoginy like I don't know and I don't

4735.56 --> 4740.42
want to know

4737.06 --> 4742.1
could be I suspect that he has that

4740.42 --> 4744.56
position

4742.1 --> 4747.219
but I don't know for sure

4744.56 --> 4747.219
yeah

4747.44 --> 4751.299999999999
all the other family I don't know

4753.98 --> 4757.639999999999
I mean they're not coming up to me like

4756.08 --> 4760.04
hey I didn't know you were a flat

4757.64 --> 4762.56
earther so

4760.04 --> 4764.179
they're probably all ball targeted by

4762.56 --> 4766.34
default

4764.179 --> 4768.56
I'd be able to convince them but then

4766.34 --> 4771.860000000001
they'd have to face like the same pain

4768.56 --> 4775.780000000001
about reality and how [ __ ] up Humanity

4771.86 --> 4775.78
really is that they don't want to

4781.659 --> 4785.08
thank you

4790.52 --> 4795.620000000001
that's cool blue but yeah if you're like

4792.98 --> 4798.799999999999
an Air Force pilot yeah you

4795.62 --> 4801.28
you can't be a ball [ __ ] it's too

4798.8 --> 4801.28
dangerous

4804.679 --> 4810.82
if you're like Air Force you definitely

4806.659 --> 4810.82
know the Earth is flat you would have to

4816.679 --> 4820.3
it wasn't a pilot oh okay

4821.36 --> 4826.78
how can you be Air Force and not a pilot

4824.179 --> 4826.78
what

4828.8 --> 4831.76
how does that work

4835.82 --> 4840.699
paperwork oh this is okay

4851.239 --> 4855.379999999999
here I come comment in the wall I

4853.1 --> 4857.9800000000005
dedicated my life is it

4855.38 --> 4857.9800000000005
I guess

4858.64 --> 4865.659000000001
dedicated my life to poverty and social

4862.82 --> 4865.659
isolation

4865.699 --> 4868.299999999999
sure

4875.54 --> 4880.719
to Sharp that paper yeah just pushing

4878.06 --> 4880.719
the envelope

4882.14 --> 4888.52
his dad was just literally pushing

4884.96 --> 4888.52
envelopes sorry

4888.88 --> 4891.909000000001
[Music]

4918.44 --> 4925.28
okay fine Aries 106. thanks now I know

4923.0 --> 4929.14
I just assumed that air force would be

4925.28 --> 4929.139999999999
the pilots and that the rest would be

4929.239 --> 4933.919999999999
not designated Air Force I don't know I

4932.42 --> 4936.86
didn't think about it

4933.92 --> 4938.6
now what now I know

4936.86 --> 4940.339999999999
so if somebody says in the Air Force

4938.6 --> 4942.620000000001
they could also be like the toilet

4940.34 --> 4945.28
cleaner okay

4942.62 --> 4945.28
cool

4946.76 --> 4953.54
you know what in that case

4950.06 --> 4956.780000000001
I might I might also be military because

4953.54 --> 4958.64
I did actually as a team work in the

4956.78 --> 4963.4
canteen

4958.64 --> 4963.400000000001
of a military facility on occasion

4969.32 --> 4975.739
and one of them was actually the it

4972.14 --> 4977.360000000001
an Air Force facility so I might be Air

4975.739 --> 4979.699
Force too

4977.36 --> 4981.86
I'm X Air Force how about that guys did

4979.699 --> 4984.5
you know that

4981.86 --> 4988.759999999999
I used to work at a canteen

4984.5 --> 4991.54
at the Dutch Royal Air Force

4988.76 --> 4991.54
how about that

5014.44 --> 5021.719
you flew Navy BTC the troll planes you

5018.76 --> 5021.719
weren't a pilot what

5022.0 --> 5028.739
oh you flew along it's like yeah I'm not

5025.6 --> 5032.14
a pilot but I'm flying This Plane

5028.739 --> 5034.86
yeah that's not what you meant

5032.14 --> 5034.860000000001
right

5035.56 --> 5042.179
right you didn't you flew in you didn't

5038.56 --> 5042.179
fly a good plane

5043.6 --> 5048.58
thanks for sharing

5045.52 --> 5051.219
I'm a cold war veteran that's

5048.58 --> 5054.04
I think it was in the 90s it wasn't

5051.219 --> 5057.34
really cold war anymore

5054.04 --> 5060.78
this is a cold war better okay that's

5057.34 --> 5060.78
just terrible I no

5065.44 --> 5069.879999999999
that's

5067.9 --> 5074.28
no I'm never gonna say like I'm a

5069.88 --> 5074.28
veteran like that I'm not a dick

5076.9 --> 5081.759999999999
I mean I could act like a veteran I'm

5079.36 --> 5084.04
sure oh yeah I can absolutely I could

5081.76 --> 5085.780000000001
act like that

5084.04 --> 5087.88
but I mean

5085.78 --> 5091.679
world would have to be pretty [ __ ] up

5087.88 --> 5091.679
for me to get to that position

5093.76 --> 5098.820000000001
that's my I could provide benefits to

5096.04 --> 5098.82
Veterans yeah

5099.159 --> 5104.08
but I mean

5100.659 --> 5106.599999999999
we don't really have that many

5104.08 --> 5108.46
because the Army is mostly like

5106.6 --> 5111.6
professionals

5108.46 --> 5111.6
and so it's like

5112.36 --> 5117.78
benefits to Veterans is like yeah that's

5114.94 --> 5120.099999999999
called a pension

5117.78 --> 5123.46
that's it

5120.1 --> 5125.1990000000005
like it's not like people are we don't

5123.46 --> 5126.699
have a lot of people that have been

5125.199 --> 5129.82
grafted in

5126.699 --> 5132.9
recently like United States have with

5129.82 --> 5132.9
Vietnam and all that

5136.0 --> 5142.38
right

5138.04 --> 5142.38
so it's all just professional

5144.1 --> 5149.26
and I think that most of our soldiers

5146.14 --> 5152.219
mostly have been science uh like sent

5149.26 --> 5157.659000000001
out on like

5152.219 --> 5159.82
protection missions and like Aid

5157.659 --> 5161.759999999999
I mean the Netherlands have never been

5159.82 --> 5165.099999999999
like oh front line

5161.76 --> 5167.679
operations or anything like that but

5165.1 --> 5170.8
fighting it's usually England and the US

5167.679 --> 5172.719
that does that sort of [ __ ]

5170.8 --> 5175.3
that's what it was like during the Iraq

5172.719 --> 5177.159
war in Afghanistan like the Dutch might

5175.3 --> 5179.1990000000005
get involved but they are usually like

5177.159 --> 5181.179
doing peace operations which is a great

5179.199 --> 5183.699
thing to do by the way like that is the

5181.179 --> 5187.78
better position to have it's like just

5183.699 --> 5189.04
protected the vulnerable and get Aid to

5187.78 --> 5193.0
like

5189.04 --> 5196.739
blown up places and [ __ ] like that's a

5193.0 --> 5196.739
good thing that's a good thing

5198.04 --> 5201.34
I hope that in the future the

5199.6 --> 5203.139
Netherlands will stick to that kind of

5201.34 --> 5206.38
way of doing things with the military

5203.139 --> 5209.639
it's much better that way

5206.38 --> 5212.1990000000005
don't get involved in some [ __ ] up uh

5209.639 --> 5214.78
like oh we're gonna take down this

5212.199 --> 5216.699
dictator because it's always [ __ ]

5214.78 --> 5218.38
[ __ ] the country every time that

5216.699 --> 5220.12
happens

5218.38 --> 5222.82
what the Netherlands usually gets

5220.12 --> 5225.699
involved afterward in like picking up

5222.82 --> 5227.82
the pieces and trying to help the locals

5225.699 --> 5227.82
out

5234.28 --> 5238.0199999999995
right

5235.42 --> 5241.12
so there's not like a lot of super

5238.02 --> 5243.1
traumatized veterans or like that they

5241.12 --> 5244.78
have their legs blown off all over the

5243.1 --> 5247.42
place no that's

5244.78 --> 5250.48
we don't have that

5247.42 --> 5252.9400000000005
because yeah we're not like really a

5250.48 --> 5254.44
front line warring country like that we

5252.94 --> 5257.138999999999
don't have a lot of people that are like

5254.44 --> 5259.678999999999
yeah get me in a battle in an explosions

5257.139 --> 5259.679
everywhere

5262.56 --> 5268.54
and I guess the few that we would have

5265.659 --> 5270.78
had are probably now dead in Ukraine or

5268.54 --> 5270.78
something

5271.36 --> 5275.259999999999
I mean probably

5275.38 --> 5282.52
I have no idea how many Dutch soldiers

5278.739 --> 5285.28
or have actually been involved directly

5282.52 --> 5287.820000000001
in what's going on there in that

5285.28 --> 5287.82
slaughterhouse

5290.26 --> 5292.7390000000005
anyway

5297.84 --> 5302.76
oh my God what the [ __ ] is going on

5304.9 --> 5309.28
a vacuum is a yeah yeah but that's not

5307.54 --> 5312.42
the vacuum we're talking about we're not

5309.28 --> 5314.0199999999995
talking about lower pressure zones

5312.42 --> 5316.659
yeah

5314.02 --> 5318.280000000001
we're talking about actual official

5316.659 --> 5320.86
vacuum

5318.28 --> 5323.0199999999995
not lower pressure Zone yeah you'll have

5320.86 --> 5323.98
different pressures within a closed

5323.02 --> 5325.84
system

5323.98 --> 5327.94
sure you do especially if there's

5325.84 --> 5329.9800000000005
different temperature influences there's

5327.94 --> 5332.32
going to be different pressures

5329.98 --> 5334.178999999999
it's going to be some turbulence etc etc

5332.32 --> 5337.62
but

5334.179 --> 5337.62
it's not a vacuum

5338.199 --> 5347.159
a vacuum is a significantly lower

5341.62 --> 5347.159
pressure that's well supposed to persist

5350.38 --> 5356.32
that's going to be vacuous

5353.62 --> 5358.62
next to this pressurized system that's

5356.32 --> 5361.299999999999
open to it right that's the ball Earth

5358.62 --> 5367.32
baller thinks that we're

5361.3 --> 5367.320000000001
a pressurized system open to the vacuum

5368.8 --> 5374.1990000000005
that's ridiculous there's not even a

5371.5 --> 5376.9
mechanism like there's not even a

5374.199 --> 5381.46
mechanism conceptually

5376.9 --> 5384.04
to justify how that gas that's going to

5381.46 --> 5387.46
naturally want to expand in within the

5384.04 --> 5390.58
available lower pressure volume

5387.46 --> 5394.12
how that's going to be prevented like

5390.58 --> 5396.94
there is no mechanism to even calculate

5394.12 --> 5398.98
how to do that

5396.94 --> 5401.32
do you understand

5398.98 --> 5403.599999999999
even if you saw the gravity as a force

5401.32 --> 5406.179
it wouldn't be able to do it it's not

5403.6 --> 5409.120000000001
strong enough to do it it's a very weak

5406.179 --> 5410.86
Force gas pressure expanding within the

5409.12 --> 5413.5
vacuum is considered one of the

5410.86 --> 5416.5199999999995
strongest forces in the universe it's

5413.5 --> 5416.52
totally Unstoppable

5416.92 --> 5420.159
yeah

5418.48 --> 5422.919999999999
so

5420.159 --> 5426.339999999999
there is no framework there is no

5422.92 --> 5429.88
conception for how the gas pressure

5426.34 --> 5432.6990000000005
would be prevented from expanding

5429.88 --> 5435.28
immediately and explosively within the

5432.699 --> 5439.799999999999
vacuum of space there is no mechanism

5435.28 --> 5439.8
that exists to justify this

5440.62 --> 5445.26
how I can someone go up I don't know

5445.48 --> 5448.62
I have no idea

5448.96 --> 5453.179
it could be a lot higher than we think

5453.28 --> 5457.54
but it cannot be eternally High it

5455.86 --> 5460.62
cannot be an endless

5457.54 --> 5460.62
trip upward

5461.739 --> 5464.08
and

5463.0 --> 5467.8
yeah

5464.08 --> 5471.84
and I think that there's logically we

5467.8 --> 5474.76
like the entire height would probably be

5471.84 --> 5476.38
twice the length that we can possibly

5474.76 --> 5478.719
reach

5476.38 --> 5480.34
something like that because the higher

5478.719 --> 5482.28
you go it's just going to be completely

5480.34 --> 5484.54
impossible to reach that

5482.28 --> 5486.82
utterly impossible like it's gonna have

5484.54 --> 5489.28
the same issues like a rocket can't push

5486.82 --> 5491.86
itself through in the lower pressure

5489.28 --> 5493.0599999999995
Zone eventually it's gonna like not lose

5491.86 --> 5495.759999999999
momentum

5493.06 --> 5498.46
and then just fall down again like

5495.76 --> 5501.1
it could be very high up and I don't

5498.46 --> 5503.7390000000005
think we can ever get there

5501.1 --> 5506.1990000000005
because of the circumstances

5503.739 --> 5508.718999999999
so there may literally be an an

5506.199 --> 5511.12
impossibility to reach

5508.719 --> 5514.3
the eventual end

5511.12 --> 5518.76
the the presume for me presumed to be

5514.3 --> 5518.76
platform that tops It Off

5518.92 --> 5524.92
and it would have to be there

5522.1 --> 5528.120000000001
there cannot be endless volume above

5524.92 --> 5528.12
it's impossible

5532.659 --> 5536.159
you know I don't know

5536.32 --> 5542.5599999999995
I I I'm there's no point in me to start

5540.1 --> 5545.1990000000005
saying a number it's like oh there's six

5542.56 --> 5547.179
kilometers like there's no point there's

5545.199 --> 5549.28
just no point

5547.179 --> 5551.86
yeah way more than six kilometers of

5549.28 --> 5554.5199999999995
course but the the my point is is

5551.86 --> 5554.5199999999995
there's no point

5568.719 --> 5571.44
foreign

5572.04 --> 5577.84
combined into

5574.3 --> 5581.04
command German divisions okay is that

5577.84 --> 5581.04
correct I don't know could be

5586.719 --> 5591.2390000000005
the Germans are at it again yeah

5591.34 --> 5597.82
no I'm fine with that

5594.3 --> 5600.34
like I don't really have like too high

5597.82 --> 5601.04
in objection to that anyway

5600.34 --> 5603.6990000000005
but

5601.04 --> 5605.5
[Music]

5603.699 --> 5608.86
it's like this [ __ ] German government

5605.5 --> 5610.6
you know that one is really sucky has

5608.86 --> 5613.599999999999
been for a while

5610.6 --> 5616.0
very communist and that's that's the big

5613.6 --> 5617.320000000001
problem like I I don't think that's a

5616.0 --> 5620.44
good idea

5617.32 --> 5623.32
and hey by the way this is only like

5620.44 --> 5624.5199999999995
under your Europe the Europe situation I

5623.32 --> 5625.78
mean

5624.52 --> 5629.38
if

5625.78 --> 5632.98
there could there can be it can happen

5629.38 --> 5635.139
that there can be an exit

5632.98 --> 5637.78
because this government that we're

5635.139 --> 5639.9400000000005
that's still muddying around like it's

5637.78 --> 5642.82
going down by the way this happening

5639.94 --> 5645.099999999999
everywhere in the world even in America

5642.82 --> 5646.96
but it's going down and there could very

5645.1 --> 5648.820000000001
well be an exit and then it doesn't

5646.96 --> 5650.679
really matter where the Army is

5648.82 --> 5652.96
designated because they will just be

5650.679 --> 5655.719
retracted or

5652.96 --> 5658.42
made a deal about it like you can hire

5655.719 --> 5660.699
us even though we're not part of Europe

5658.42 --> 5663.4
I don't know it's all business anyway

5660.699 --> 5664.9
like Europe is business it was always

5663.4 --> 5667.179
business you know

5664.9 --> 5671.259999999999
did you know that how Europe started was

5667.179 --> 5673.06
literally a business arrangement

5671.26 --> 5674.5
that's how it started this is how the

5673.06 --> 5677.6990000000005
Euro started

5674.5 --> 5677.699
in the late 90s

5677.92 --> 5684.4
from the gilders we went to the euro

5682.36 --> 5688.96
because of that it would make it

5684.4 --> 5690.5199999999995
financially more proficient and with

5688.96 --> 5692.5
transport

5690.52 --> 5694.719
would make things easier and that did

5692.5 --> 5697.0
work it did work it was a business

5694.719 --> 5698.92
Arrangement it was pretty good one then

5697.0 --> 5700.86
suddenly all this [ __ ] started roll

5698.92 --> 5704.02
out about oh we need a government

5700.86 --> 5708.28
governmental bodies for whatever U.N

5704.02 --> 5710.620000000001
[ __ ] objection objectives and so

5708.28 --> 5713.5
then suddenly this [ __ ] unelected

5710.62 --> 5716.62
[ __ ] started up that was never part

5713.5 --> 5719.199
of the deal it never was

5716.62 --> 5721.0
it's they basically just like like a

5719.199 --> 5724.54
cancer just like oh oh yeah we're gonna

5721.0 --> 5726.88
form this unelected government now like

5724.54 --> 5729.4
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you that

5726.88 --> 5731.08
wasn't part of the deal you bastards

5729.4 --> 5733.599999999999
and they're everybody's kind of just

5731.08 --> 5735.699
letting it happen sort of like going

5733.6 --> 5738.52
against it and started

5735.699 --> 5739.599999999999
but it is like that was never part of

5738.52 --> 5743.139
the deal

5739.6 --> 5745.120000000001
there was no government as part of the

5743.139 --> 5746.7390000000005
European deal

5745.12 --> 5749.139
fact

5746.739 --> 5751.9
and there shouldn't be it should be

5749.139 --> 5756.1
abolished

5751.9 --> 5759.759999999999
like no more like [ __ ] your European

5756.1 --> 5763.06
government we don't need you yeah

5759.76 --> 5766.54
we don't need a unified body

5763.06 --> 5769.719
we have our governments that are

5766.54 --> 5772.36
cooperating or are not that's how we do

5769.719 --> 5774.88
it we don't need your [ __ ] unelected

5772.36 --> 5776.739
group of snobs

5774.88 --> 5779.08
is going to talk about how we all eat

5776.739 --> 5783.218999999999
need to eat bugs and [ __ ]

5779.08 --> 5784.9
yeah we don't need that crap [ __ ] off

5783.219 --> 5787.3
we'll have her we have our own

5784.9 --> 5789.82
governments and we will work with each

5787.3 --> 5792.9400000000005
other as we have throughout most of

5789.82 --> 5795.219
Europe's history and well also Wars but

5792.94 --> 5797.099999999999
you know what I mean

5795.219 --> 5800.52
we got better

5797.1 --> 5800.52
especially like

5800.98 --> 5804.9
after mid 20th century

5806.199 --> 5808.259999999999
um

5813.88 --> 5819.159000000001
can Dutch possess gold yeah why the hell

5817.239 --> 5821.32
wouldn't we able to be possessing gold

5819.159 --> 5824.32
dude this is the Netherlands

5821.32 --> 5826.62
we invented banking

5824.32 --> 5830.44
the day that the Dutch wouldn't be

5826.62 --> 5832.9
allowed to possess gold would be like a

5830.44 --> 5836.759999999999
really [ __ ] up day

5832.9 --> 5836.759999999999
I mean that's like the end of the world

5844.719 --> 5848.86
the Netherlands invented banking there's

5847.6 --> 5851.9400000000005
like

5848.86 --> 5851.94
there's no way

5852.76 --> 5859.12
in gold in forms beside Julian coins

5857.98 --> 5861.04
yeah

5859.12 --> 5864.179
bars

5861.04 --> 5864.179
sure why not

5867.37 --> 5870.439
[Music]

5872.739 --> 5878.759999999999
yeah I know Aries

5874.739 --> 5878.759999999999
as I said we got better

5878.98 --> 5883.839999999999
if we hadn't gotten better then we would

5881.44 --> 5885.159
have never never even started a European

5883.84 --> 5886.72
Union

5885.159 --> 5889.54
okay

5886.72 --> 5892.42
[Music]

5889.54 --> 5895.179
it's illegal to own gold bars and while

5892.42 --> 5897.219
the US is pretty [ __ ] up

5895.179 --> 5902.5
I mean it is

5897.219 --> 5904.719
it people regard the us as the empire

5902.5 --> 5908.1
so I'm not surprised at all that you can

5904.719 --> 5908.1
own gold bars there

5910.12 --> 5913.12
okay

5914.01 --> 5920.819
[Music]

5929.98 --> 5933.218999999999
but maybe it's a new rule or something

5931.78 --> 5935.5199999999995
where are you getting this from steamy

5933.219 --> 5935.52
Traveler

5943.42 --> 5950.76
I heard that it was in the past

5946.9 --> 5950.759999999999
they forbid forbade it

5954.4 --> 5957.94
well I don't know maybe they

5955.78 --> 5960.659
re-initiated where are you getting this

5957.94 --> 5960.659
from steamy

5964.239 --> 5969.94
right that's right yeah I know I've

5967.78 --> 5972.159
learned about that Supreme knowing so

5969.94 --> 5973.839999999999
yeah

5972.159 --> 5975.5199999999995
but I thought it was lifted too maybe

5973.84 --> 5977.56
they put his back on or something I

5975.52 --> 5979.7390000000005
don't know man maybe that's about to

5977.56 --> 5979.7390000000005
happen

5980.38 --> 5986.88
I mean with Biden at the at the wheel we

5983.5 --> 5986.88
would be surprised you know

6002.42 --> 6008.34
see me traveler did you might be uh a

6006.48 --> 6009.959999999999
bit behind the times indeed unless

6008.34 --> 6012.8
there's something that just recently

6009.96 --> 6012.8
happened I don't know

6015.84 --> 6021.360000000001
or maybe just this fact slipped you by

6019.56 --> 6023.9400000000005
can't be man

6021.36 --> 6026.759999999999
don't worry about it

6023.94 --> 6029.879999999999
I mean it's not like you you said bendy

6026.76 --> 6031.56
cranes as a rebuttal to Black Swan or

6029.88 --> 6034.5
something okay I'm not gonna berate you

6031.56 --> 6037.219
for making an error like that

6034.5 --> 6037.219
like this

6037.679 --> 6042.62
thinking that gold this gold bars are

6039.96 --> 6042.62
still illegal

6049.56 --> 6055.02
all right anyway I hope you guys are all

6051.48 --> 6057.419999999999
enjoying the show been going for a while

6055.02 --> 6060.179
I can't keep going

6057.42 --> 6061.92
I feel pretty good today I had a good

6060.179 --> 6065.36
healing

6061.92 --> 6068.76
for my healer over email it worked

6065.36 --> 6070.08
it sounds weird but it works I feel a

6068.76 --> 6072.42
lot better I had a good meal yesterday

6070.08 --> 6075.0599999999995
also

6072.42 --> 6078.36
like I'm moving more towards less

6075.06 --> 6080.04
summary oriented food

6078.36 --> 6082.98
so I had like

6080.04 --> 6087.78
mashed potatoes red beet

6082.98 --> 6092.659
and a beef sausage in a lot of butter

6087.78 --> 6092.659
and it was like really welcome

6092.94 --> 6098.82
it's like the bed like I guess it's like

6096.36 --> 6099.719
that it's been rainy and all that that's

6098.82 --> 6102.54
just

6099.719 --> 6106.4
I need different food and these pizzas

6102.54 --> 6106.4
are like I'm getting sick of pizza

6109.5 --> 6115.32
a bunch of people burn their goat

6112.86 --> 6119.159
whoa

6115.32 --> 6120.84
platinum gold ring whoa damn

6119.159 --> 6123.239
okay nice

6120.84 --> 6126.08
how's my left shoulder doing great it's

6123.239 --> 6126.08
doing much better

6127.08 --> 6131.58
it's not entirely gone yet but I mean it

6129.659 --> 6134.159
is like so much better compared to

6131.58 --> 6136.82
yesterday even

6134.159 --> 6142.04
what's my favorite pizza well it's

6136.82 --> 6142.04
basically uh Margarita pepperoni

6142.38 --> 6145.28
that's what I do

6145.38 --> 6152.159000000001
but I make it myself I just have a base

6148.139 --> 6157.6990000000005
Margarita and then I rearrange it and

6152.159 --> 6157.699
add chili pepper and add salami

6170.179 --> 6176.6
okay toiling what the hell

6173.219 --> 6176.6
where are you getting that from

6178.32 --> 6181.34
that's weird

6183.3 --> 6187.92
[Music]

6184.639 --> 6191.06
how does that where how does that fend

6187.92 --> 6191.06
off wire tapping

6191.34 --> 6195.08
how does that work toylin

6223.32 --> 6227.82
they got no don't start talking about oh

6226.02 --> 6230.719
I'm talking about which food I

6227.82 --> 6233.82
completely forgot about my rookola

6230.719 --> 6235.5
I'm not super hungry but it's because I

6233.82 --> 6237.9
just had such a satisfying meal

6235.5 --> 6240.239
yesterday I think

6237.9 --> 6243.48
that I'm not like I need an Illuminati

6240.239 --> 6243.48

[Music]

6254.28 --> 6257.28

6269.48 --> 6275.54
spinach pizzas what

6272.34 --> 6275.54
never heard of that one

6276.9 --> 6278.9
um

6310.05 --> 6315.049
[Music]

6325.26 --> 6330.619000000001
it doesn't make sense well then why the

6327.719 --> 6330.619
hell did you bring it up

6331.619 --> 6336.659
or you read that

6334.08 --> 6339.54
sounds like a [ __ ] story sounds like

6336.659 --> 6343.5
a Grappler trick to make people

6339.54 --> 6345.84
like put their expensive platinum rings

6343.5 --> 6347.1
in the garden so that they could steal

6345.84 --> 6349.92
it

6347.1 --> 6352.860000000001
that's what that sounds like to me

6349.92 --> 6354.659
just another Graveler trick oh yeah we

6352.86 --> 6355.98
do like special things and you have to

6354.659 --> 6358.799999999999
have like a piece of gold that you have

6355.98 --> 6360.718999999999
to put it in the gardens like against

6358.8 --> 6363.6
spying

6360.719 --> 6366.2390000000005
and then the the one they tell like oh

6363.6 --> 6369.780000000001
oh cool I'm gonna try that out like oh

6366.239 --> 6373.08
and then like yeah my Ring's gone

6369.78 --> 6377.239
oh yeah that could happen

6373.08 --> 6377.239
just sounds like a Grappler trick to me

6404.119 --> 6409.92
pineapple essential for all pizzas how

6407.159 --> 6411.839999999999
dare you blue build evolution

6409.92 --> 6413.82
get out

6411.84 --> 6416.96
I'm taking your wrench you're out of

6413.82 --> 6416.96
here no just kidding

6422.4 --> 6426.78
do you want pineapple on your pizza

6424.56 --> 6428.900000000001
that's fine I just don't want to look at

6426.78 --> 6428.9
it

6441.42 --> 6446.659
I think like pineapple and pizza like

6444.0 --> 6446.659
falls under

6449.28 --> 6452.48
I don't know it's like

6453.84 --> 6458.6990000000005
you have to keep it behind closed doors

6455.82 --> 6461.34
in Sharia too

6458.699 --> 6463.138999999999
you can't like publicly eat pineapple on

6461.34 --> 6467.719
pizza

6463.139 --> 6467.719
just like being gay and all that

6470.159 --> 6475.5199999999995
that was complete nonsense of what I

6472.92 --> 6475.52
just said but

6476.76 --> 6478.76
um

6485.719 --> 6492.9
two kinds of people pineapple pizza

6488.1 --> 6497.84
pizza people none pineapple pizza people

6492.9 --> 6497.839999999999
well I've ate it at occasion

6500.1 --> 6504.3
but I I mean

6502.5 --> 6506.52
it's okay

6504.3 --> 6508.38
but I'm not a big fan especially when

6506.52 --> 6511.1
there's bacon involved because I don't

6508.38 --> 6511.1
eat bacon

6524.82 --> 6531.44
pineapple and pizza is illegal in

6528.239 --> 6531.44
certain areas in New York

6537.08 --> 6542.719
don't do pork either yeah I'd never do

6540.36 --> 6542.719
it though

6565.619 --> 6570.599999999999
but yeah I mean I don't understand why

6568.5 --> 6572.4
don't you just eat pizza

6570.6 --> 6575.639
with ham

6572.4 --> 6577.679
and then have a little bowl of

6575.639 --> 6580.9800000000005
fresh

6577.679 --> 6585.119
pineapple on the side I mean

6580.98 --> 6588.599999999999
isn't fresh pineapple a lot more yummy

6585.119 --> 6591.5
than heat it on a pizza

6588.6 --> 6591.5
I don't get it

6605.699 --> 6609.44
should be legalized

6610.32 --> 6617.42
maybe a condoning policy you can have

6613.44 --> 6617.419999999999
you can only have like

6618.3 --> 6625.139
three pineapple pizzas

6621.6 --> 6625.92
in a house within one week time at a

6625.139 --> 6628.56
time

6625.92 --> 6630.96
if you if anybody finds that you have

6628.56 --> 6633.2390000000005
more than three pineapple pizzas within

6630.96 --> 6635.46
a week time within the same room

6633.239 --> 6638.239
that's then yeah they can send the

6635.46 --> 6638.2390000000005
police after you

6650.82 --> 6655.159
the pineapple pizza police

6656.39 --> 6659.539000000001
[Music]

6687.659 --> 6691.739
you can take your pineapple pizza from

6689.94 --> 6695.659
your cold dead hands

6691.739 --> 6695.659
why because you didn't eat it

6698.34 --> 6702.179
I mean

6700.08 --> 6704.84
if you love it so much why didn't you

6702.179 --> 6704.84
just eat it

6718.32 --> 6725.0
the pineapple pizza please

6722.4 --> 6725.0
me

6726.6 --> 6732.679
I thought you were gonna PayPal me for a

6728.82 --> 6732.679
second there Dr utker how dare you

6735.619 --> 6739.46
but yeah I like it

6740.46 --> 6745.34
I'm gonna put it in the title actually I

6742.619 --> 6745.339999999999
like it that much

6749.14 --> 6752.169000000001
[Music]

6755.7 --> 6759.898999999999
[Music]

6765.0 --> 6771.56
there we go

6767.1 --> 6771.56
it made it into the title Dr Whitaker

6796.08 --> 6802.619
thought Flat Earth was a controversial

6799.02 --> 6805.26
topic but pineapple on Pizza is much

6802.619 --> 6808.08
more controversial

6805.26 --> 6811.219
thank you for that Bill Nye the science

6808.08 --> 6811.219
desire that's brilliant

6839.1 --> 6844.860000000001
that's great

6841.32 --> 6846.9
it is making me hungry still though

6844.86 --> 6849.839999999999
so I'm probably am

6846.9 --> 6851.96
going to round out the show not too soon

6849.84 --> 6854.76
because

6851.96 --> 6857.34
I am hungry

6854.76 --> 6859.139
[Music]

6857.34 --> 6861.32
and we've been going for almost two

6859.139 --> 6861.32
hours

6865.38 --> 6870.08
might get demonetized for this subject

6875.4 --> 6881.339999999999
or I barely get monetized anymore anyway

6878.639 --> 6885.119
since I had the three months no

6881.34 --> 6887.46
appearing and got back after that it's

6885.119 --> 6890.099999999999
like all the advertisers are they don't

6887.46 --> 6892.44
show up anymore

6890.1 --> 6894.84
has anybody noticed that I'm just not

6892.44 --> 6896.339999999999
getting any ads

6894.84 --> 6898.02
that they're not gonna they're not

6896.34 --> 6900.56
playing even though they're turned on if

6898.02 --> 6900.56
they don't play

6901.26 --> 6906.360000000001
have you guys noticed

6903.54 --> 6907.739
it's like they just cut off all

6906.36 --> 6909.839999999999
advertisement even though it's

6907.739 --> 6912.839999999999
officially not

6909.84 --> 6912.84
demonetized

6914.34 --> 6920.159000000001
well four months ago you would have like

6918.06 --> 6922.88
even during the live show two or three

6920.159 --> 6922.879999999999
ads a day

6925.32 --> 6928.159
you would see that

6933.119 --> 6935.719
right

6941.219 --> 6945.619
on your watch your mobile you can still

6942.84 --> 6945.619000000001
get ads okay

6957.9 --> 6961.44
you saw an ad and a week ago and was

6960.06 --> 6964.1
surprised

6961.44 --> 6964.099999999999
right

6965.639 --> 6970.92
I guess that the ad companies have

6967.98 --> 6972.839999999999
become really picky all of a sudden as

6970.92 --> 6976.9800000000005
to when they're gonna like advertise

6972.84 --> 6978.2390000000005
because I put my ads like ad option on

6976.98 --> 6981.36
every day

6978.239 --> 6985.28
every day there's been no exception

6981.36 --> 6985.28
it's just something I do standard

6986.1 --> 6989.34
on this channel I mean I couldn't do

6988.02 --> 6992.400000000001
that on our Winnie and bear Channel

6989.34 --> 6994.679
because it wasn't monetized but

6992.4 --> 6995.94
as soon as I get back I turned it back

6994.679 --> 6998.46
on

6995.94 --> 7001.638999999999
and it just didn't re it just was gone

6998.46 --> 7004.28
it's like it just turned off

7001.639 --> 7006.58
really weird like why did it now turn

7004.28 --> 7006.58
off

7010.4 --> 7015.5
and someone watches an ad on my channel

7012.139 --> 7018.04
yeah sort of it's added to like the

7015.5 --> 7018.04
Google money

7019.219 --> 7023.96
and but yeah that

7021.739 --> 7027.138999999999
eventually

7023.96 --> 7028.88
when I report that I do have to like pay

7027.139 --> 7030.92
it back so I don't really get too much

7028.88 --> 7033.139
out of it but it's good it's an

7030.92 --> 7036.28
indicator it's just an indicator of like

7033.139 --> 7036.28
what's happening with my channel

7036.619 --> 7041.719
and I still get little amounts but still

7039.739 --> 7044.299999999999
some add money

7041.719 --> 7046.639
from like older shows

7044.3 --> 7049.2390000000005
I still do people are still watching

7046.639 --> 7049.2390000000005
that apparently

7059.599 --> 7064.46
I don't know maybe some people out there

7061.4 --> 7065.719
are like digging way back just to see

7064.46 --> 7068.54
like

7065.719 --> 7071.06
how did he get to this point of like

7068.54 --> 7072.5
what I am right now like how did Arwin

7071.06 --> 7075.679
get to that

7072.5 --> 7079.82
I mean for me even it's pretty weird to

7075.679 --> 7082.76
like watch Flat Earth talks shows

7079.82 --> 7084.199
because well it's like six seven years

7082.76 --> 7086.42
ago

7084.199 --> 7089.0
and I just seem so different

7086.42 --> 7093.139
didn't have a mustache and all kinds of

7089.0 --> 7096.199
issues including skin issues

7093.139 --> 7099.4400000000005
like sir I had more anxiety much more

7096.199 --> 7101.598999999999
anxiety in me than I do now and it's

7099.44 --> 7103.58
like yeah people might watch my show now

7101.599 --> 7105.56
and then just be like I just want to

7103.58 --> 7108.199
watch what it was like then

7105.56 --> 7111.56
and that yeah

7108.199 --> 7115.0599999999995
that's still real

7111.56 --> 7115.06
getting in some ad money

7117.139 --> 7122.78
ah the old volcano show yeah that one is

7120.139 --> 7124.52
really popular by the way slow moment

7122.78 --> 7126.619
but it's like one of my highest watched

7124.52 --> 7130.3
videos ever

7126.619 --> 7130.299999999999
and it keeps popping up

7136.34 --> 7140.7390000000005
it's the one where I was talking about

7138.26 --> 7143.900000000001
how potentially

7140.739 --> 7146.78
volcanic lava could be happening by some

7143.9 --> 7149.54
kind of natural induction coil effect

7146.78 --> 7151.719
that literally just melts The Rock in

7149.54 --> 7151.719
place

7154.159 --> 7159.5
that's the one that I put in that show

7156.86 --> 7161.78
that really stood out to that I have

7159.5 --> 7163.82
other theories too you know but that's

7161.78 --> 7166.0
what I got that's what I thought of back

7163.82 --> 7166.0
then

7171.639 --> 7178.2390000000005
you couldn't keep watching me because of

7175.159 --> 7178.239
my current standard

7179.78 --> 7185.119
couldn't keep what yeah well I did like

7182.659 --> 7187.638999999999
want to roll out certain things that I

7185.119 --> 7190.58
now really commonly talk about and I was

7187.639 --> 7192.8
just like I'm afraid uh I I you're gonna

7190.58 --> 7195.08
realize that back then like the first

7192.8 --> 7197.2390000000005
two years I was really afraid that it

7195.08 --> 7201.32
was gonna be assassinated

7197.239 --> 7203.54
I'm not joking I I actually thought that

7201.32 --> 7205.58
like they're gonna assassinate me for

7203.54 --> 7208.099
this I really thought that I was

7205.58 --> 7209.719
terrified but also like I can't stop it

7208.099 --> 7212.0
I have to do this

7209.719 --> 7214.659
is like

7212.0 --> 7214.659
yeah

7215.679 --> 7219.46
that was terrifying

7223.699 --> 7228.379999999999
moving around a lot

7225.619 --> 7231.5599999999995
yeah that too I was like what

7228.38 --> 7235.179
I wanted that and this and that and

7231.56 --> 7235.179
yeah I was moving around a lot

7241.88 --> 7246.02
I'm not that bad

7244.099 --> 7248.360000000001
no I didn't think they were going to

7246.02 --> 7251.900000000001
assassinate me because I was so terrible

7248.36 --> 7254.0
to behold or anything Ben Arthur

7251.9 --> 7257.299999999999
I just thought that it had to do with

7254.0 --> 7259.28
flat Earth because I don't know whether

7257.3 --> 7261.26
that's like Dark World stuff or not but

7259.28 --> 7263.0
I've been like threatened

7261.26 --> 7266.119000000001
that

7263.0 --> 7268.88
like getting into Flat Earth would

7266.119 --> 7271.88
literally get me killed

7268.88 --> 7274.42
it's been said to me on multiple

7271.88 --> 7274.42
occasions

7277.3 --> 7280.51
[Music]

7283.58 --> 7291.099
and I'm talking about before 2015. it's

7286.699 --> 7291.098999999999
been told to me on multiple occasions

7293.719 --> 7300.199
I think I have potentially maybe even

7296.9 --> 7303.739
watched somebody get assassinated

7300.199 --> 7306.98
because of that subject

7303.739 --> 7309.678999999999
but it's very hard to tell like even

7306.98 --> 7312.199
like where and how or what [ __ ] up

7309.679 --> 7314.599
[ __ ] with the Jesuit guy but it could

7312.199 --> 7316.759999999999
also have been just a simulation by the

7314.599 --> 7319.719
devil that took his skin which I found

7316.76 --> 7319.719
out only much later

7321.38 --> 7327.400000000001
it's actually more likely that it wasn't

7324.44 --> 7327.4
the real person

7327.56 --> 7332.659000000001
so but that makes it even more

7330.08 --> 7335.36
fascinating why the [ __ ] does the devil

7332.659 --> 7340.159
and like the other side why are they

7335.36 --> 7342.98
like monstrously anti-flat Earth

7340.159 --> 7346.119
why would they why would entities on the

7342.98 --> 7349.4
other side threaten me with like

7346.119 --> 7350.78
assassination and torture

7349.4 --> 7353.0599999999995
over

7350.78 --> 7357.58
speaking out about Flat Earth

7353.06 --> 7357.580000000001
that always was really weird to me

7367.82 --> 7370.82
because

7371.9 --> 7377.0599999999995
maybe stop

7373.52 --> 7380.7390000000005
pressing enter before you're sure

7377.06 --> 7380.7390000000005
you've said what you want to say

7381.56 --> 7387.04
stop

7382.94 --> 7387.04
don't touch the enter button

7388.46 --> 7392.119
scr okay

7396.02 --> 7402.92
yeah well phones just suck

7399.4 --> 7405.08
keyboards and touch pads suck I hate it

7402.92 --> 7408.4400000000005
that's why I hate smartphones and I

7405.08 --> 7412.699
won't never want one

7408.44 --> 7416.138999999999
I want clicky clicky or nothing clicky

7412.699 --> 7416.138999999999
clicky or nothing

7423.139 --> 7426.7390000000005
because the devil's Father of Lies maybe

7425.36 --> 7429.5599999999995
yeah

7426.739 --> 7431.419999999999
well that logically makes sense it's

7429.56 --> 7433.659000000001
just so freaking surreal that that

7431.42 --> 7433.659
happened

7433.76 --> 7437.119000000001
like that's really surreal that that

7435.92 --> 7439.88
happened

7437.119 --> 7442.46
that I would be on the other side with

7439.88 --> 7444.8
weird entities and [ __ ]

7442.46 --> 7447.44
and that they would literally like get

7444.8 --> 7449.96
shocked and it was almost like saying

7447.44 --> 7454.119
the word Jesus Christ

7449.96 --> 7454.119
which they did not appreciate either

7457.76 --> 7462.860000000001
although Flat Earth was more threatening

7460.82 --> 7465.259999999999
than Jesus Christ that's the weirdest

7462.86 --> 7468.0199999999995
part but it might also be because of

7465.26 --> 7470.96
just this weird Jesuit influence that

7468.02 --> 7474.38
was part of that experience

7470.96 --> 7476.96
and Jesuits are just those demons are

7474.38 --> 7478.88
apparently not directly afraid of Jesus

7476.96 --> 7480.9800000000005
Christ because of like the whole

7478.88 --> 7483.38
discipline

7480.98 --> 7487.04
of it

7483.38 --> 7490.46
like basically how they

7487.04 --> 7493.94
I'd idolize it how they commit idolatry

7490.46 --> 7496.04
on Jesus because of the iconization the

7493.94 --> 7497.48
iconization that has happened in the

7496.04 --> 7500.239
church that's taken everything out of

7497.48 --> 7502.48
context and that the devil does not fear

7500.239 --> 7502.48
that

7504.5 --> 7509.86
the devil does not fear the idolized

7510.56 --> 7516.860000000001
made into a literal God Jesus Christ

7514.4 --> 7520.159
he fears

7516.86 --> 7524.44
the actual God

7520.159 --> 7524.44
and the wisdom of Christ

7525.139 --> 7530.32
this the frequency of him that's what he

7527.9 --> 7530.32
fears

7532.4 --> 7537.92
but it's like even in like when in

7534.679 --> 7540.08
interactions it was like yeah Jesus like

7537.92 --> 7542.659
Jesus and God and

7540.08 --> 7545.0599999999995
it's it's has to be because of the

7542.659 --> 7547.94
Jesuit background with that that they

7545.06 --> 7550.52
would be like yeah that's ours they

7547.94 --> 7552.5599999999995
would like claim Jesus as their owns

7550.52 --> 7556.280000000001
like everything that has to do with that

7552.56 --> 7560.06
that's ours that's our property

7556.28 --> 7561.8
like that's my information it's ours

7560.06 --> 7564.580000000001
we own that

7561.8 --> 7564.58
was weird

7565.159 --> 7569.96
but with flat Earth it was

7567.8 --> 7572.900000000001
different response and they had the

7569.96 --> 7576.32
whole and it was the devil in that sense

7572.9 --> 7579.138999999999
with the Jesuit guy's skin in this case

7576.32 --> 7583.04
that would still hint

7579.139 --> 7585.4400000000005
like secretly drop information about

7583.04 --> 7588.199
Flat Earth but not saying it so like

7585.44 --> 7591.58
showing me a picture and then like

7588.199 --> 7591.58
not saying it

7592.219 --> 7595.159
that's

7593.659 --> 7596.299999999999
how I got

7595.159 --> 7598.5199999999995
like

7596.3 --> 7600.7390000000005
flatter through Dark World Visions on

7598.52 --> 7602.4800000000005
the other side it was still through the

7600.739 --> 7604.5199999999995
devil but it's like he couldn't say

7602.48 --> 7607.82
anything he could only show me some

7604.52 --> 7609.8
things like depictions

7607.82 --> 7613.46
it's like it was forbidden to tell me

7609.8 --> 7616.34
but he still like needed me to know or I

7613.46 --> 7618.56
asked for it and he had to answer

7616.34 --> 7620.719
so it's like I asked him to tell me

7618.56 --> 7623.360000000001
about things that he really was allergic

7620.719 --> 7626.3
to so he then had to like use mimicry

7623.36 --> 7628.54
and pictures to give me the answer or

7626.3 --> 7628.54
something

7629.3 --> 7631.4800000000005
thank you

7634.099 --> 7639.04
it's weird it's all very very freaking

7636.8 --> 7639.04
weird

7645.5 --> 7654.02
but yeah like Flat Earth is

7649.94 --> 7655.759999999999
it has a very pronounced influence in

7654.02 --> 7658.580000000001
the other dimension

7655.76 --> 7659.900000000001
it does like The Knowing of it the

7658.58 --> 7663.8
busying with it

7659.9 --> 7666.5599999999995
and if you're a flat earther that really

7663.8 --> 7670.58
doesn't necessarily matter unless you

7666.56 --> 7673.6990000000005
know exactly how it is in the ball

7670.58 --> 7675.739
I think it's that I think that the real

7673.699 --> 7677.36
fear for flat earthers from the Dark

7675.739 --> 7680.839999999999
Side from even within the other

7677.36 --> 7683.96
dimension is the knowledge of How It's

7680.84 --> 7686.78
not a globe I think that that is the

7683.96 --> 7689.119
thing that the devil really fears the

7686.78 --> 7690.98
knowledge of How It's not a globe not

7689.119 --> 7692.179
necessarily of what it really is what's

7690.98 --> 7695.239
the truth

7692.179 --> 7698.4800000000005
but how to undo

7695.239 --> 7701.54
the fake cosmology

7698.48 --> 7703.58
that's what it fears

7701.54 --> 7706.04
because it can't do anything against

7703.58 --> 7709.5199999999995
that it can control people it can

7706.04 --> 7710.9
convince people it can pull people in

7709.52 --> 7713.599
punish

7710.9 --> 7718.78
people that are in

7713.599 --> 7718.78
but it can't counter the arguments

7720.02 --> 7724.46
only try to circumvent it and manipulate

7722.84 --> 7726.38
it and distract away from it and and

7724.46 --> 7728.599
we're literally seeing that by the way

7726.38 --> 7731.179
in the physical real world we're

7728.599 --> 7734.0
experienced that with with with Ballers

7731.179 --> 7737.4800000000005
and anti-flat earthers

7734.0 --> 7741.739
but in the other dimension that's the

7737.48 --> 7743.48
same like they don't have an answer they

7741.739 --> 7746.119
don't know what to do about it only

7743.48 --> 7749.259999999999
takes away power from them from the

7746.119 --> 7749.259999999999
Devils from the Dark Side

7750.44 --> 7755.239
so I just thought I wanted to share that

7753.26 --> 7758.599
with you guys

7755.239 --> 7761.48
said Jesus Christ is kind of known to

7758.599 --> 7764.900000000001
have like an impact on the other side in

7761.48 --> 7767.419999999999
dreams and in other dimensions whatever

7764.9 --> 7772.759999999999
even under drug trips even

7767.42 --> 7775.4800000000005
like Ayahuasca but Flat Earth is also

7772.76 --> 7775.4800000000005
like that

7776.119 --> 7780.44
if you say Jesus Christ in the other

7778.099 --> 7782.42
dimension it it can make it can like

7780.44 --> 7784.159
freeze people like make their face

7782.42 --> 7787.76
freezing like

7784.159 --> 7789.44
like that or it can go like and they run

7787.76 --> 7791.599
away screaming like a bunch of goblins

7789.44 --> 7793.699
like that can happen where you say the

7791.599 --> 7796.46
word Jesus Christ or they look

7793.699 --> 7798.0199999999995
it away but when you talk about Flat

7796.46 --> 7800.96
Earth

7798.02 --> 7803.780000000001
they are just as freaking startled like

7800.96 --> 7806.44
it's startles things out there in the

7803.78 --> 7806.44
other dimension

7807.139 --> 7811.76
that's fascinating

7809.48 --> 7813.138999999999
like oh the name of the savior of course

7811.76 --> 7816.08
is going to have an impact yeah how

7813.139 --> 7818.84
about mentioning Flat Earth why the [ __ ]

7816.08 --> 7821.84
does mentioning Flat Earth do that too

7818.84 --> 7823.6990000000005
in the other dimension and for beside

7821.84 --> 7826.58
that why does it do that in this

7823.699 --> 7829.94
Dimension why did people have such an

7826.58 --> 7833.44
exaggerated response when Flat Earth was

7829.94 --> 7834.98
brought up like pretty much up until

7833.44 --> 7836.9
2015.

7834.98 --> 7839.959999999999
why would people have such an

7836.9 --> 7842.54
exaggerated reaction to that so heavily

7839.96 --> 7844.219
I mean we rationalize it as flat

7842.54 --> 7846.679
earthers is like yeah of course because

7844.219 --> 7849.26
it's always it's like the key point of

7846.679 --> 7850.76
all the indoctrinations got there as a

7849.26 --> 7853.46
little kid so of course it's an

7850.76 --> 7856.119000000001
exaggerated reaction

7853.46 --> 7856.119
but

7856.82 --> 7861.199
still though

7859.04 --> 7864.32
still it's

7861.199 --> 7867.739
just because it's logically arguable

7864.32 --> 7869.48
like why it isn't a reaction it still

7867.739 --> 7872.86
doesn't explain why it's so freaking

7869.48 --> 7872.86
heavy I mean

7874.88 --> 7879.02
people react

7876.38 --> 7881.119
really heavily to it

7879.02 --> 7885.219
although I have experienced it even way

7881.119 --> 7885.219
before like with 911 like

7886.28 --> 7891.92
I've had people go completely ape [ __ ]

7889.159 --> 7894.619
and like screaming literally screaming

7891.92 --> 7897.86
in a group people

7894.619 --> 7900.259999999999
when I would say that like 911 might be

7897.86 --> 7903.619
an inside job oh my god did I trigger

7900.26 --> 7905.06
that P those people Jesus

7903.619 --> 7908.44
like they were going to physically

7905.06 --> 7908.4400000000005
assault me I thought even

7908.659 --> 7912.638999999999
but yeah that was weird

7913.52 --> 7916.360000000001
but

7916.52 --> 7921.080000000001
what is the correlating factor with all

7918.739 --> 7922.58
of these responses is it just the truth

7921.08 --> 7925.4
is it just

7922.58 --> 7927.44
the is it the truth or is it mostly the

7925.4 --> 7930.379999999999
undoing of the lies like if certain

7927.44 --> 7933.739
words if certain implications are

7930.38 --> 7936.92
communicated then it undoes like a

7933.739 --> 7940.699
background delusion

7936.92 --> 7943.04
that a lot of people apparently need

7940.699 --> 7945.678999999999
somehow they need

7943.04 --> 7948.0199999999995
for those things to be that delusion

7945.679 --> 7953.1990000000005
that incorrect

7948.02 --> 7953.1990000000005
to keep going with Society or something

7954.26 --> 7960.8
like don't make don't tell me how

7957.44 --> 7963.638999999999
Society lied to me or I can't deal with

7960.8 --> 7963.639
Society anymore

7964.34 --> 7972.7390000000005
is that part of why

7968.84 --> 7976.46
the the responses can be so extreme is

7972.739 --> 7978.799999999999
it that is it don't tell me how Society

7976.46 --> 7979.94
lies to me or I can't deal with Society

7978.8 --> 7982.88
anymore

7979.94 --> 7986.98
is it that is that the effect

7982.88 --> 7986.9800000000005
that makes people react so heavily

7992.719 --> 7997.699
I wonder

7995.119 --> 8000.04
but it was interesting to me that there

7997.699 --> 8002.379999999999
was such pronounced memories of Dark

8000.04 --> 8005.38
Worlds on the other side

8002.38 --> 8008.02
that involved like knowing it was the

8005.38 --> 8010.2390000000005
other dimension from me

8008.02 --> 8012.6990000000005
like being aware that is not just like

8010.239 --> 8014.5
oh we're just communicating and then

8012.699 --> 8017.079
afterwards like wait what that was where

8014.5 --> 8019.659
was that that wasn't a dream no no being

8017.079 --> 8021.699
aware that it is the Dark World in the

8019.659 --> 8024.46
dream when it was happening

8021.699 --> 8027.04
and then like testing this sort of thing

8024.46 --> 8031.36
experiment like what is this place what

8027.04 --> 8033.82
are you really are you a simulacrum from

8031.36 --> 8035.92
me are you a thing that I created to

8033.82 --> 8038.199
interact with me or to express certain

8035.92 --> 8041.38
knowledge or are you an actual entity

8038.199 --> 8042.879999999999
and if so what are your roots what's

8041.38 --> 8045.599
feeding you where are you coming from

8042.88 --> 8045.599
where are you going

8048.639 --> 8052.26
exploring the Dark World

8052.719 --> 8059.28
I had a lot of time to do it you got to

8055.659 --> 8059.28
do something with freaking 80 years

8075.579 --> 8083.04
the smart device is a person provides

8078.4 --> 8083.04
into their life the Dumber they are yeah

8083.26 --> 8089.079000000001
smart devices

8085.3 --> 8092.92
take over your smarts

8089.079 --> 8094.78
and when you don't use it you lose it

8092.92 --> 8097.2390000000005
so it stimulates like direct

8094.78 --> 8099.88
technological dependency for your own

8097.239 --> 8104.079
intellectual function or even your

8099.88 --> 8106.86
general rhythmic awareness

8104.079 --> 8109.84
to take over those normally standardized

8106.86 --> 8112.239
brain Incorporated functions to take

8109.84 --> 8116.079
them over from you so that you can just

8112.239 --> 8119.0199999999995
become a dumb drooling little baby

8116.079 --> 8121.239
that can just every second of their life

8119.02 --> 8124.619000000001
be told exactly what to do and they just

8121.239 --> 8124.619
respond like a robot

8125.8 --> 8132.06
that's what smart devices are for to

8128.26 --> 8132.06
tear you into drooling babies

8134.8 --> 8137.1990000000005
right anyway I'm gonna take a two minute

8136.3 --> 8140.52
break

8137.199 --> 8140.5199999999995
I'll be right back

8140.97 --> 8144.209
[Music]

8147.09 --> 8150.189
[Music]

8239.26 --> 8242.26
foreign

8267.16 --> 8272.399
about smart devices

8269.859 --> 8272.399000000001
okay

8278.2 --> 8281.2
hmm

8281.92 --> 8284.460000000001
foreign

8335.679 --> 8340.3
I think I'm going to round out to show

8337.599 --> 8342.54
guys I've been going over two hours 15

8340.3 --> 8342.539999999999
minutes
