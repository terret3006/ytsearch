307.36 --> 312.16
interesting

310.08 --> 314.15999999999997
so

312.16 --> 317.16
thing about keanu reeves it is kind of

314.16 --> 317.16
mind-boggling

325.6 --> 330.16
to be fair i can't wait to finish

327.44 --> 330.16
watching that

330.56 --> 334.199
this was interesting

342.56 --> 345.72
all right

355.84 --> 358.88
okay cleary

359.199 --> 367.0
yeah he's went on all kind of news

379.76 --> 382.829
[Music]

388.96 --> 394.19899999999996
where have i been watching owen uh on

391.199 --> 394.199
bitchute

396.8 --> 400.12

428.56 --> 432.84
right and no problem lg

440.24 --> 443.24
um

452.88 --> 455.88
wallace

479.199 --> 481.52000000000004
right

483.599 --> 485.84
yeah

484.8 --> 486.8
so

485.84 --> 489.28
this

486.8 --> 492.919
ancestral wind situation is lasting

489.28 --> 492.919
longer than i expected

493.68 --> 496.8
like when it started

497.919 --> 500.15999999999997
like

498.879 --> 501.52000000000004
really

500.16 --> 504.0
hacking there

501.52 --> 508.479
last monday i thought it was just gonna

504.0 --> 508.479
last like two days but it's not really

509.12 --> 512.72
and i'm still kind of in it

513.039 --> 517.12
so i don't know how long it'll last

514.88 --> 521.8389999999999
maybe it'll be aft over after this

517.12 --> 521.839
weekend or maybe last another week

522.88 --> 528.8
but yeah i'm noticing that i'm kind of

524.8 --> 528.8
low on energy on average

532.399 --> 538.24
and yeah staying up very late is not

534.8 --> 540.88
exactly the remedy to that so i should

538.24 --> 540.88
get a grip

541.519 --> 544.519
um

558.64 --> 564.56
right so yeah yesterday

562.24 --> 566.48
adam meekin

564.56 --> 569.8389999999999
was on

566.48 --> 569.839
mitchell from australia

571.44 --> 576.519
yeah that was yesterday wasn't it

573.519 --> 576.519
yeah

576.64 --> 585.04
and that was like really informative

581.44 --> 589.2790000000001
he basically talked about in depth

585.04 --> 591.4399999999999
about the whole cannabinoid system

589.279 --> 594.0
healing with it

591.44 --> 595.9200000000001
very detailed show so if you hadn't

594.0 --> 598.32
actually seen that

595.92 --> 600.3199999999999
i recommend you guys to watch all of

598.32 --> 602.399
that

600.32 --> 604.1600000000001
it was really good

602.399 --> 606.56
i

604.16 --> 610.56
couldn't keep my attention to it the

606.56 --> 610.56
entire time but i know it was good

612.079 --> 616.56
it's just that right now i'm kind of

614.32 --> 616.5600000000001
like

616.8 --> 623.56
not able to grab on things as good as i

620.079 --> 623.56
normally can

654.88 --> 660.24
topic today no not really a topic

657.92 --> 662.64
not to have wallace i'm just kind of

660.24 --> 662.64
hanging

664.16 --> 670.959
i went to bed too late

667.76 --> 670.959
i'm still kind of like

673.36 --> 677.76
regretting it

675.92 --> 680.76
even though it was very exciting saying

677.76 --> 680.76
up

681.14 --> 684.419
[Music]

692.24 --> 696.72
from the grave hello why did i go to bed

694.48 --> 698.16
yeah it's just this the game i've been

696.72 --> 700.24
playing

698.16 --> 702.64
pathfinder king maker it's been like

700.24 --> 704.5600000000001
going pretty good

702.64 --> 708.48
and so i got like caught up in a new

704.56 --> 712.7199999999999
story part of it and it was just like

708.48 --> 712.72
basically a very exciting dungeon

713.839 --> 718.5600000000001
and i cut yeah i had a lot of trouble

715.76 --> 718.56
stepping away

727.2 --> 734.639
never thought about getting a dog

730.639 --> 734.639
i wouldn't want that no no

737.44 --> 745.0
no i yeah i'm not really a dog guy like

740.079 --> 745.0
that like i do appreciate dogs

749.279 --> 753.76
but yeah

751.44 --> 756.0
i like i've always been more of a cat

753.76 --> 758.24
guy i guess

756.0 --> 760.48
but i'm not even gonna get a cat right

758.24 --> 760.48
now

768.639 --> 773.519
am i addicted to gaming

771.519 --> 774.48
well

773.519 --> 776.88
yeah

774.48 --> 776.88
a little

777.04 --> 781.279
it's not as bad as bad as it used to be

782.079 --> 788.16
i've had times where it was literally

784.24 --> 791.12
just gaming like 14 hours straight

788.16 --> 793.92
and that got me like even

791.12 --> 797.16
that gets me dizzy and [ __ ] so i i don't

793.92 --> 797.16
do that

797.22 --> 800.45
[Music]

800.8 --> 806.16
but yeah like games have definitely been

803.68 --> 810.04
pulling my attention since at a very

806.16 --> 810.04
since a very young age

821.68 --> 825.199
but yeah i'm not

824.0 --> 827.839
i'm not

825.199 --> 830.0
like trying out a whole bunch of games

827.839 --> 832.399
these days right because there is plenty

830.0 --> 832.399
out there

832.48 --> 837.6800000000001
now when i'm much much younger i was

834.24 --> 839.6
much more eager to like try out anything

837.68 --> 842.2399999999999
that was that i could get my hands on

839.6 --> 844.88
and that's

842.24 --> 847.44
that's dramatically died down in like

844.88 --> 847.4399999999999
the last

848.48 --> 851.12
10 years

852.88 --> 857.16
more probably 12.

857.199 --> 860.8
because i kind of like just

862.399 --> 866.079
i'm starting to figure out the patterns

864.72 --> 869.639
of the games

866.079 --> 869.6389999999999
and yeah

871.12 --> 876.16
so there's just a bit less of a mystery

873.839 --> 880.639
to it to me now like i get how that

876.16 --> 882.079
works i get how it grabs your attention

880.639 --> 884.24
and

882.079 --> 887.12
yeah i just kind of gotten to know the

884.24 --> 889.76
types of games that i like

887.12 --> 891.76
versus the ones that i really don't even

889.76 --> 894.0
ever need to try again because i know i

891.76 --> 896.16
won't like them just because of the set

894.0 --> 897.76
the setting

896.16 --> 900.399
the

897.76 --> 903.68
the interface type like i don't like

900.399 --> 906.72
first person 3d games like at all

903.68 --> 906.7199999999999
anymore like they

908.24 --> 914.48
13 years ago i figured out that they

910.72 --> 916.88
were actually making me sick nauseated

914.48 --> 919.76
like on a on a vis on a physical level

916.88 --> 922.079
it hasn't even to do with like

919.76 --> 924.24
the mind or the story or whatever it's

922.079 --> 926.399
just that

924.24 --> 930.24
it made me physically ill now i know

926.399 --> 932.88
that that has only gotten worse

930.24 --> 936.48
like i can't even watch

932.88 --> 937.519
like videos with 3d games [ __ ] in them

936.48 --> 939.6800000000001
now

937.519 --> 942.079
and i already start to feel that it's

939.68 --> 945.279
like especially right now

942.079 --> 945.279
when i feel like this

947.04 --> 954.279
the autumn having hidden and all now i

949.68 --> 954.279
don't even want to see a second of it

955.68 --> 958.959
tomb wasn't classy yeah

963.04 --> 966.079
right

964.0 --> 969.04
well the first time i kind of become

966.079 --> 970.8
became interested in 3d shooters and

969.04 --> 973.759
with that's like

970.8 --> 977.3599999999999
still 20th century

973.759 --> 980.32
i got like into quake one and two

977.36 --> 980.32
especially two

980.88 --> 986.639
and then kind of like trying out all

984.639 --> 989.279
kinds of things quick three and all

986.639 --> 990.0790000000001
these other 3d types of game shooters

989.279 --> 992.72
and

990.079 --> 995.519
arena type games

992.72 --> 997.839
and then pretty much

995.519 --> 997.839
after

998.079 --> 1002.0
a half-life two

1000.16 --> 1004.959
like i started to notice with half-life

1002.0 --> 1008.16
that no there's something wrong with me

1004.959 --> 1010.8
and then when two hit i got so sick of

1008.16 --> 1012.88
physically ill from it

1010.8 --> 1015.04
i literally decided like

1012.88 --> 1017.4399999999999
like i can't play these types of games

1015.04 --> 1017.4399999999999
anymore

1017.839 --> 1022.399
like yes it is exciting up to a certain

1020.72 --> 1026.079
degree

1022.399 --> 1026.079
but it's too punishing

1026.4 --> 1031.39
right

1028.27 --> 1031.3899999999999
[Music]

1032.0 --> 1037.559
hello nathan oakley

ew

1188.0 --> 1192.64

1190.32 --> 1196.28
don't know i still haven't really

1192.64 --> 1196.2800000000002
asked about it

1210.0 --> 1216.0
like yeah i kind of like to wait to do

1213.84 --> 1218.8799999999999
that until at least i feel a little

1216.0 --> 1218.88
better than this

1218.96 --> 1221.8400000000001
right

1232.72 --> 1237.919
how cold can it get there in the winter

1234.799 --> 1237.9189999999999
yeah it well

1239.919 --> 1245.919
it all depends on on the winter we've

1242.559 --> 1247.44
had like really cold winters

1245.919 --> 1250.5590000000002
where it would be

1247.44 --> 1251.679
freezing and snow and all that but

1250.559 --> 1255.28
overall

1251.679 --> 1255.2800000000002
it kind of stays

1256.4 --> 1260.48
i don't know it all depends on like what

1258.559 --> 1264.48
kind of winter it's going to be like

1260.48 --> 1264.48
we've had plenty of very mild winters

1265.039 --> 1268.0
coldest temperatures

1274.24 --> 1278.32
well i'd have to go i would have to

1276.159 --> 1280.7990000000002
google that

1278.32 --> 1280.799
i don't know

1288.4 --> 1291.8400000000001
what you live in nature

1290.559 --> 1295.3999999999999
well

1291.84 --> 1295.3999999999999

thanks

1329.919 --> 1337.0800000000002
well i've i have never experienced in my

1332.48 --> 1337.08
lifetime anything close to that

1353.039 --> 1358.32
i think that maybe at some point i've

1355.52 --> 1360.8799999999999
like experienced -18

1358.32 --> 1363.6789999999999
for like a week

1360.88 --> 1363.679
something like that

1364.88 --> 1367.1200000000001
but

1370.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
i haven't been really even keeping track

1373.039 --> 1375.84
of the temperature

1376.159 --> 1382.64
in my mind for that all that long

1379.44 --> 1386.2
i kind of only started doing that
