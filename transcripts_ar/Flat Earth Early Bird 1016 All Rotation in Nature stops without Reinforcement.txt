join button that will be much

125.439 --> 128.879
appreciated

126.96 --> 131.2
and need it

128.879 --> 131.2
right

131.28 --> 137.68
so weather today is again

134.72 --> 137.68
quite nice

138.319 --> 143.28
it's a bit

140.16 --> 146.959
it's not like perfectly blue skies

143.28 --> 149.36
seems to be just a bit of haze up there

146.959 --> 152.16
can't tell whether it's like

149.36 --> 152.87900000000002
haze left by trails or

152.16 --> 155.84
just

152.879 --> 159.67999999999998
came to be naturally

155.84 --> 159.68
a lot of birds flying up there right now

161.76 --> 170.0
but uh yeah clouds as well

164.72 --> 171.76
but still in between at all nice sun

170.0 --> 175.92
decently warm

171.76 --> 175.92
and there's like no wind no wind at all

177.12 --> 181.519
interesting

179.599 --> 184.879
i think the birds up there are probably

181.519 --> 187.59900000000002
just riding their right riding the

184.879 --> 187.599
rising heat

188.159 --> 194.239
because without wind there should be

190.72 --> 194.239
plenty of rising heat here

195.519 --> 200.959
see that

198.72 --> 200.959
all right

208.72 --> 214.599
so

210.959 --> 216.879
hello cleary first in chat

214.599 --> 219.599
tara306 good to see you

216.879 --> 219.599
good servant

221.12 --> 225.04
so

222.08 --> 229.799
it is saturday

225.04 --> 229.79899999999998
the 18th of september 2021

232.08 --> 235.12
low ground control

239.36 --> 244.64000000000001
right

241.439 --> 244.64
so yesterday was

245.599 --> 249.599
a couple of great streams all together

248.48 --> 251.599
again

249.599 --> 254.64
very similar to the day before i was

251.599 --> 256.4
multitasking again sitting on the fed

254.64 --> 259.59999999999997
after show and at the same time

256.4 --> 259.59999999999997
listening to good servant

260.799 --> 264.56
who was doing a live stream because i

262.639 --> 266.8
kind of really like good servants live

264.56 --> 269.04
streams

266.8 --> 272.0
and that's like an honest assessment

269.04 --> 274.40000000000003
it's not just because he's my friend

272.0 --> 275.6
and because he is

274.4 --> 277.67999999999995
right

275.6 --> 279.44
but yeah if i compare like his live

277.68 --> 280.8
streams now

279.44 --> 282.88
to say

280.8 --> 285.36
a year ago

282.88 --> 288.4
i like his live streams now

285.36 --> 290.08000000000004
a year ago i would be there perhaps as a

288.4 --> 292.32
friend

290.08 --> 294.96
but i didn't really like it that much

292.32 --> 297.59999999999997
you were kind of stumbly

294.96 --> 300.4
good-hearted good-spirited stumbly

297.6 --> 302.56
a little disoriented

300.4 --> 305.44
and not very confident

302.56 --> 307.199
and all of that has changed

305.44 --> 309.199
and i think it's come from your pure

307.199 --> 310.639
dedication

309.199 --> 314.16
to like

310.639 --> 316.639
like you decided you're gonna do this

314.16 --> 318.72
and i highly respect that

316.639 --> 322.32
because your streams are much more

318.72 --> 324.96000000000004
interesting your chat is very vibrant

322.32 --> 327.52
to be honest i i'd say even your chat is

324.96 --> 330.4
even more vibrant than mine

327.52 --> 332.639
although i have good times in my chat as

330.4 --> 332.63899999999995
well

333.12 --> 337.12
so yeah

334.32 --> 339.84
well done good servant

337.12 --> 342.88
you got great streams and i do like

339.84 --> 345.44
being there in the chat

342.88 --> 345.44
when i can

346.639 --> 350.0
but yeah the flat earth debate after

348.72 --> 353.84000000000003
show was

350.0 --> 353.84
very good as well

355.759 --> 362.88
this was very focused and informative so

358.72 --> 362.88000000000005
that it should make a great sunday show

365.12 --> 368.639
huh hello bobby stills

371.84 --> 376.63899999999995
like by the way

374.0 --> 377.84
that whole situation yesterday about the

376.639 --> 379.68
msg

377.84 --> 381.59999999999997
that [Â __Â ]

379.68 --> 383.6
grew out of hand

381.6 --> 385.199
and some of you that have been over at

383.6 --> 387.36
brandon's

385.199 --> 389.6
yesterday which was also again kind of

387.36 --> 392.319
fun to just sit through i tried to by

389.6 --> 394.72
the way get on to brandon's discord but

392.319 --> 397.199
the link didn't work

394.72 --> 399.36
i don't know why

397.199 --> 403.759
because he also has like an after show i

399.36 --> 406.40000000000003
kind of wanted to be on that as well but

403.759 --> 408.8
couldn't get in so i don't know why that

406.4 --> 410.4
is next time he does a live stream i'll

408.8 --> 413.36
just

410.4 --> 415.599
try to ask him in chat

413.36 --> 419.039
anyway

415.599 --> 420.96
hello dusty ryder aerys cursor man agm

419.039 --> 423.84
hey welcome back man

420.96 --> 423.84
good to see you

425.039 --> 429.919
marquee wise

427.599 --> 429.919
lou

439.12 --> 443.84000000000003
yeah good to have you back again hope

441.039 --> 443.84
you're doing all right

444.08 --> 446.31899999999996
uh

447.44 --> 454.08
anyway back to that weird situation

450.88 --> 454.08
what was his name again

454.24 --> 458.72
the guy that got all obsessed about the

456.4 --> 461.12
msg like

458.72 --> 462.56
pretty much enti the entirety of

461.12 --> 465.84000000000003
brandon's stream

462.56 --> 465.84
i was there in chat

466.8 --> 470.8
basically going at this guy in

469.12 --> 472.56
retrospect it almost felt a bit

470.8 --> 476.16
embarrassing

472.56 --> 479.12
but that guy was like seriously obsessed

476.16 --> 481.52000000000004
super weird pj crew shank was there i

479.12 --> 482.639
don't know if he's here just yet

481.52 --> 484.4
probably

482.639 --> 486.639
will

484.4 --> 489.75899999999996
he stayed up pretty late i stayed up

486.639 --> 489.759
insanely late

490.16 --> 495.199
because yeah i i got what i asked for

492.639 --> 496.8
energy whole freaking a lot of energy i

495.199 --> 498.0
asked for it yesterday on the show and i

496.8 --> 499.84000000000003
did

498.0 --> 502.4
and then it was like five o'clock when i

499.84 --> 505.4
went to bed oops

502.4 --> 505.4
but

506.16 --> 510.8
i did take some extra rest i pretty much

508.479 --> 513.519
slept until

510.8 --> 515.44
15 to 1 today

513.519 --> 517.12
and still decently on time how about

515.44 --> 519.519
that

517.12 --> 521.599
anyway dreams were back

519.519 --> 522.88
not as super intense as they were two

521.599 --> 525.36
days ago

522.88 --> 527.2
but they were back because

525.36 --> 529.279
what i aim for

527.2 --> 531.44
worked out

529.279 --> 531.4399999999999
like

531.6 --> 536.32
i was very careful with what i ate i did

534.16 --> 539.519
eat dinner in time

536.32 --> 541.36
and it all really worked out no issues i

539.519 --> 543.36
feel good no

541.36 --> 545.519
like

543.36 --> 547.04
physical tension because i ate something

545.519 --> 549.519
wrong

547.04 --> 552.0799999999999
so i think today's stream should be

549.519 --> 552.08
pretty good

552.48 --> 556.64
uh

554.24 --> 556.64
anyway

558.959 --> 563.8389999999999
ready return to normal

561.6 --> 563.839
the

565.12 --> 567.6
how come

567.92 --> 570.88
why do you think that

572.0 --> 576.399
it was kind of silly because

574.24 --> 579.44
even over at brandon's eventually there

576.399 --> 581.68
were like two ballers

579.44 --> 583.519
i think bobby stills was there too

581.68 --> 584.7199999999999
what was it what was the guy the other

583.519 --> 587.519
guy

584.72 --> 591.839
he actually just started defending me

587.519 --> 591.839
over the msg thing it was really funny

599.36 --> 603.16
hello jbdl2021

613.6 --> 619.72
can you elaborate

615.279 --> 619.72
exactly what you mean return to normal

619.92 --> 624.7199999999999
i was a bit over the top i really wasn't

622.88 --> 625.68
everything that i

624.72 --> 628.0
noted

625.68 --> 630.64
are all things that i like really

628.0 --> 631.6
ingrained like really learned by heart

630.64 --> 633.4399999999999
because i thought it was really

631.6 --> 636.72
important

633.44 --> 636.72
like 15 years ago

638.399 --> 641.68
was basically part of my own medical

640.32 --> 643.839
study

641.68 --> 645.1999999999999
my layman medical study for my own

643.839 --> 647.6800000000001
health

645.2 --> 650.24
so i really because i was kind of

647.68 --> 652.4799999999999
addicted to msg back in the day

650.24 --> 655.36
and it was really difficult at the time

652.48 --> 657.519
to get off it

655.36 --> 658.64
because it it does something to your

657.519 --> 661.839
mind

658.64 --> 665.04
it is literally addictive

661.839 --> 668.0400000000001
or it has been to me

665.04 --> 668.04
so

675.04 --> 678.7199999999999
ooh

675.92 --> 681.68
hey jim yeah

678.72 --> 683.6
yeah i never eat microwaved meals

681.68 --> 686.0
never

683.6 --> 688.0
i i i don't use the microwave for

686.0 --> 690.32
anything for anything i'm gonna eat or

688.0 --> 690.32
drink

697.839 --> 702.8800000000001
i haven't used microwave for anything

699.92 --> 704.0
like that in

702.88 --> 707.12
well

704.0 --> 709.68
yeah in 15 years

707.12 --> 709.68
like never

709.92 --> 714.4799999999999
well not i can't say absolutely never

712.48 --> 715.44
sometimes i was like oh i'm really in a

714.48 --> 717.839
hurry

715.44 --> 717.839
and then

718.0 --> 720.0
but that's

719.2 --> 722.399
like

720.0 --> 725.279
in a total in 15 years that might have

722.399 --> 727.519
been like five times so

725.279 --> 727.519
right

728.959 --> 732.76
and

729.76 --> 732.76
anyway

753.839 --> 757.9590000000001
wait what's this

768.399 --> 773.32
hold up

770.32 --> 773.32
fresh

781.6 --> 786.519
weird i feel a little dizzy all of a

783.519 --> 786.519
sudden

788.639 --> 792.0790000000001
it is kind of warm in here

798.16 --> 801.8389999999999
hey stopping traffic in my rest i had

818.8 --> 824.92
[Music]

821.519 --> 824.92
be right back

832.88 --> 836.92
hmm what is this

845.68 --> 848.68
hmm

867.36 --> 872.399
oh

868.32 --> 874.72
synchronous riding with a 747

872.399 --> 874.72
no

880.079 --> 884.2399999999999
oh i really don't like giant finds and

882.72 --> 887.279
over here in the netherlands there

884.24 --> 888.72
there's like a lot of like speed cameras

887.279 --> 890.959
so

888.72 --> 890.9590000000001
no

893.279 --> 899.6
although i've done my fair share of very

896.32 --> 901.519
fast driving without a single accident

899.6 --> 903.36
by the way ever

901.519 --> 905.12
ever

903.36 --> 907.44
because yeah

905.12 --> 907.44
anyway

910.959 --> 914.4799999999999
hey dutch sailor good to see you

922.24 --> 926.92
right been watching owen benjamin

928.079 --> 932.4799999999999
and he had like these

931.12 --> 935.44
this was from

932.48 --> 935.44
thursday i think

938.72 --> 941.839
alpha vedic

945.199 --> 948.8
these two guys and like

949.44 --> 955.9200000000001
the one guy the older gentleman

953.279 --> 959.8389999999999
like he had like this room

955.92 --> 962.88
and i was just like what is that

959.839 --> 964.9590000000001
because seriously

962.88 --> 966.48
half of the things that were standing in

964.959 --> 969.1199999999999
his room there

966.48 --> 971.9200000000001
i recognized them because my dad has

969.12 --> 974.16
that equipment literally like this guy

971.92 --> 974.16
was

975.04 --> 982.279
it it gave me a weird sense like he

977.44 --> 982.2790000000001
might actually have known my dad

983.12 --> 988.48
maybe because it's just like wow

986.24 --> 990.639
doing the same things

988.48 --> 992.48
he might just know my dad

990.639 --> 993.759
serious

992.48 --> 997.12
and he he

993.759 --> 998.639
was all about the german new medicine

997.12 --> 1000.399
and all that

998.639 --> 1002.32
which i by the way i thought was weird

1000.399 --> 1004.0
that oh he asked about like hey do you

1002.32 --> 1006.1600000000001
know about german new medicine and now

1004.0 --> 1010.04
benjamin said

1006.16 --> 1010.04
well no not really

1011.839 --> 1014.72
even though i've been bringing that up

1013.36 --> 1018.32
for

1014.72 --> 1020.5600000000001
for years now and including in his chats

1018.32 --> 1022.1600000000001
so that was a little weird but i guess

1020.56 --> 1024.3999999999999
that he might have just never really

1022.16 --> 1027.199
touched on it too deeply

1024.4 --> 1029.679
or he just thinks like no i haven't

1027.199 --> 1030.72
studied every single piece of literature

1029.679 --> 1033.3600000000001
of this

1030.72 --> 1035.1200000000001
so i can consider i consider myself out

1033.36 --> 1036.9589999999998
of pride that i don't know it right he

1035.12 --> 1039.12
could have said it like that because

1036.959 --> 1041.199
he must know something about it by now

1039.12 --> 1045.52
must there's just no way that he's like

1041.199 --> 1045.52
never heard of it unless he's just like

1046.16 --> 1051.2
put it on the long burner and not giving

1048.48 --> 1053.76
it any attention anyway

1051.2 --> 1056.16
it was quite interesting

1053.76 --> 1060.8799999999999
that show

1056.16 --> 1062.88
quite quite so very well worth watching

1060.88 --> 1065.1200000000001
and also yeah

1062.88 --> 1067.2
it's a bit of a show from yesterday this

1065.12 --> 1070.32
morning half of it

1067.2 --> 1074.72
was also just great

1070.32 --> 1074.72
very informative spiritually as well

1077.28 --> 1082.799
what's new in the flat earth community

1080.08 --> 1082.799
oh uh

1083.039 --> 1089.12
somebody's emailed me a song

1085.919 --> 1089.1200000000001
i think it was ilg

1092.4 --> 1096.5590000000002
and i don't think it's anywhere on a

1094.48 --> 1098.4
channel otherwise you just give me a

1096.559 --> 1102.48
link

1098.4 --> 1102.48
but i'm gonna try playing it

1104.72 --> 1109.84
because i thought it was very

1105.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
entertaining very mellow

1112.48 --> 1117.1200000000001
and it is about the flat earth community

1114.559 --> 1118.16
so let's play this and let's see if you

draw tangent to that

1302.72 --> 1308.559
yeah pretty epic isn't it like i got i

1305.76 --> 1310.08
like that song it's so mellow and

1308.559 --> 1313.12
dude

1310.08 --> 1317.8799999999999
it's careful it's i i really liked

1313.12 --> 1317.8799999999999
trumpets i i guess it's

1318.32 --> 1323.28
dutch thing i really like this song it's

1321.039 --> 1325.84
great man and he just sent it to me just

1323.28 --> 1326.8799999999999
like didn't even comment just like it is

1325.84 --> 1329.9189999999999
the song

1326.88 --> 1329.919
i think he made it

1331.28 --> 1334.8799999999999
it didn't say

1333.12 --> 1336.9599999999998
i hope i've not been playing somebody

1334.88 --> 1339.5200000000002
else's like monetized song or anything

1336.96 --> 1343.28
that would be kind of weird but i really

1339.52 --> 1343.28
liked it thought it was worth playing

1345.52 --> 1349.76
uh

1346.799 --> 1354.9189999999999
well gadget inspector allegedly it's

1349.76 --> 1354.919
from isles g he comes here in chat too

1362.96 --> 1367.1200000000001
trumpets make our win go a bit funny

1367.52 --> 1370.1589999999999
sometimes

1370.799 --> 1377.9189999999999
it's just chorus trumpets

1374.32 --> 1380.1589999999999
horns trumpets i don't know i i just

1377.919 --> 1384.3600000000001
it does something

1380.159 --> 1384.3600000000001
like gives me like it

1389.12 --> 1395.039
triggers i guess certain parts of my

1392.32 --> 1397.36
visual imagination for some reason

1395.039 --> 1400.0
because i always see a bunch of things

1397.36 --> 1403.76
when i hear such sounds i don't know

1400.0 --> 1406.08
i just love it what

1403.76 --> 1408.24
not just trump no it's all good

1406.08 --> 1412.48
but just the trumpets in there like

1408.24 --> 1412.48
really for me gave it this edge

1412.64 --> 1416.4
i like it

1414.24 --> 1418.72
i really like the song might play it

1416.4 --> 1418.72
again

1420.96 --> 1424.8400000000001
hey pg crew shank

1433.12 --> 1437.6399999999999
stop avoiding a call with me

1448.72 --> 1452.24
maybe

1449.679 --> 1454.64
one time not saying to make a habit of

1452.24 --> 1456.72
it maybe we should do like a three-way

1454.64 --> 1458.48
call sometime

1456.72 --> 1461.1200000000001
or three-way show

1458.48 --> 1464.159
rest a good servant of me i don't know

1461.12 --> 1464.1589999999999
just thinking about it

1468.08 --> 1472.6789999999999
anyway

1469.679 --> 1472.679
yeah

1476.48 --> 1481.2
brass section makes reggae bluebeat and

1479.36 --> 1484.24
sky come alive yeah

1481.2 --> 1484.24
i agree aries

1484.48 --> 1489.96
that's a very musically informed

1486.96 --> 1489.96
assessment

1510.24 --> 1516.799
right so yeah the title of today's show

1514.32 --> 1519.2
i'm not entirely sure where exactly

1516.799 --> 1520.799
where i got it but i was in the chat

1519.2 --> 1522.64
when i did

1520.799 --> 1524.8799999999999
think about it

1522.64 --> 1529.2
it's just due to the

1524.88 --> 1530.4
assumed to be a rotation of earth

1529.2 --> 1531.279
right

1530.4 --> 1533.52
so

1531.279 --> 1536.0
there is no example of anything that

1533.52 --> 1539.36
rotates in nature

1536.0 --> 1539.36
that doesn't stop

1539.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
nothing spins forever without

1541.84 --> 1544.8799999999999
reinforcement right that part is very

1543.84 --> 1545.9189999999999
important

1544.88 --> 1548.48
because

1545.919 --> 1550.72
i don't know like with a for example a

1548.48 --> 1553.2
weird water system you could have like

1550.72 --> 1555.3600000000001
an endless cycle

1553.2 --> 1558.0800000000002
but like a physical

1555.36 --> 1559.6789999999999
rotation system and i think even in a

1558.08 --> 1563.08
vacuum

1559.679 --> 1565.1200000000001
it never spins forever

1563.08 --> 1567.52
[Applause]

1565.12 --> 1570.2399999999998
like it might spin extremely long but

1567.52 --> 1573.279
never forever

1570.24 --> 1573.279
and just thought of that

1573.36 --> 1579.76
like hey

1575.6 --> 1579.76
ball earth is assumed to spin forever

1581.279 --> 1584.6
how come

1585.76 --> 1588.8799999999999
what's

1586.72 --> 1591.1200000000001
enhancing its momentum what's

1588.88 --> 1595.48
reinforcing the spin

1591.12 --> 1595.4799999999998
to stay as steady as it is

1600.559 --> 1603.559
anyway

1632.48 --> 1637.5
[Applause]

1639.12 --> 1644.32
yeah except for them lights well lights

1641.279 --> 1646.72
don't have a physical body

1644.32 --> 1648.6399999999999
and a momentum

1646.72 --> 1650.3990000000001
right because only

1648.64 --> 1651.76
it only applies to

1650.399 --> 1655.039
actual

1651.76 --> 1658.1589999999999
things spinning

1655.039 --> 1658.1589999999999
like yeah you could

1658.24 --> 1662.559
create an illusion of something spinning

1660.32 --> 1664.48
and then keep that going

1662.559 --> 1666.24
but it's not actually a thing spinning

1664.48 --> 1668.159
it's just

1666.24 --> 1670.08
assumed to spin it doesn't have a

1668.159 --> 1673.6000000000001
physical body

1670.08 --> 1673.6
so it doesn't have any momentum

1679.279 --> 1685.2
so happy to not be sick anymore okay

1682.96 --> 1685.2
right

1687.76 --> 1691.12
is there some background noise there

1689.36 --> 1693.52
yeah yeah

1691.12 --> 1696.6
it's just my roommate vacuum cleaning

1693.52 --> 1696.6
the hallway

1699.919 --> 1702.3200000000002
i think

1702.799 --> 1706.36
yeah it should be

1737.2 --> 1741.0800000000002
it's distracting me

1763.6 --> 1767.1999999999998
ah

1764.399 --> 1768.6399999999999
he's done

1767.2 --> 1771.3600000000001
it's not a girl

1768.64 --> 1771.3600000000001
rasta hat

1771.84 --> 1775.76
now i think that both the girls have

1774.0 --> 1779.24
gone home this is

1775.76 --> 1779.24
the guy roommate

1795.919 --> 1799.919
now they went home yesterday already

1797.679 --> 1804.76
said that that's the reason why i

1799.919 --> 1804.76
basically afforded myself to be loud

1815.679 --> 1821.52
all right and before besides before i

1818.32 --> 1823.6789999999999
basically gonna pull them in on my show

1821.52 --> 1826.48
i might want to break to her like that

1823.679 --> 1829.679
it's about flat earth and all that so

1826.48 --> 1834.44
yeah not just gonna randomly pull

1829.679 --> 1834.44
unsuspect ignore me in there

1837.76 --> 1842.64
although this roommate does know i'm

1839.84 --> 1842.6399999999999
into flat earth

1842.799 --> 1847.72
but i don't think he cares for it that

1844.72 --> 1847.72
much

1882.159 --> 1886.159
oh okay i got you inspector

1891.44 --> 1896.0
too bad the earth is flat no matter what

1893.039 --> 1898.559
he believe well i'm not saying that he

1896.0 --> 1900.399
believes in a ball it's just that

1898.559 --> 1902.799
when i brought it up it just didn't do

1900.399 --> 1904.7199999999998
anything for him

1902.799 --> 1907.72
didn't really have a response against it

1904.72 --> 1907.72
either

1925.12 --> 1928.12
okay

1951.919 --> 1954.88
yeah i think i'm gonna say something

1953.44 --> 1958.039
about it because this is actually kind

1954.88 --> 1958.0390000000002
of annoying

1973.679 --> 1976.679
is

1984.48 --> 1987.64
all right

1990.64 --> 1993.64
okay

2005.84 --> 2009.6
was he cool

2007.519 --> 2012.72
i think his is very distract i think

2009.6 --> 2012.7199999999998
he's cleaning just because

2013.12 --> 2017.32
something's on his mind so

2020.88 --> 2023.279
like

2021.84 --> 2025.4399999999998
he

2023.279 --> 2027.76
has a very

2025.44 --> 2029.44
big social life it's a big part of what

2027.76 --> 2031.279
he does he like hangs around with a

2029.44 --> 2033.679
whole bunch of people and he talks with

2031.279 --> 2035.919
all of them on a personal level so he's

2033.679 --> 2037.679
probably kind of preoccupied like with

2035.919 --> 2040.159
what certain friends are

2037.679 --> 2042.48
having issues man there seems to be a

2040.159 --> 2046.159
lot of like

2042.48 --> 2048.079
breakups and [Â __Â ] happening everywhere

2046.159 --> 2050.0
serious like that's really stood out to

2048.079 --> 2051.52
me even through

2050.0 --> 2054.32
other streams

2051.52 --> 2054.32
hearing about it

2056.079 --> 2058.8
so

2057.599 --> 2061.04
i don't know

2058.8 --> 2063.76
i'm just guessing

2061.04 --> 2063.7599999999998
i haven't asked

2068.72 --> 2073.6789999999996
we haven't really been very chatty

2070.399 --> 2076.96
towards each other

2073.679 --> 2076.96
this last month so

2077.76 --> 2081.8390000000004
more empathy is under it oh don't

2083.919 --> 2086.0789999999997
so

2086.639 --> 2089.839
only if you let it

2092.96 --> 2099.56
that's not funny and i've been here the

2095.359 --> 2099.56
entire time so that's nonsense

2102.56 --> 2107.92
should smoke no no he shouldn't rest

2105.92 --> 2110.16
ahead

2107.92 --> 2111.2000000000003
no that that didn't work out for him at

2110.16 --> 2113.359
all

2111.2 --> 2114.72
he actually had serious problems with

2113.359 --> 2116.4
that

2114.72 --> 2119.52
so he's like a

2116.4 --> 2123.2400000000002
devout non-smoker

2119.52 --> 2123.24
on cannabis anyway

2139.68 --> 2147.44
that's why the break ups

2142.72 --> 2147.4399999999996
uh no no it isn't good servant

2148.56 --> 2153.119
no that's ridiculous to ascribe

2150.8 --> 2155.52
everybody suddenly breaking up being due

2153.119 --> 2158.2400000000002
to an influence

2155.52 --> 2160.0
externally

2158.24 --> 2161.4399999999996
that is sudden

2160.0 --> 2164.56
no

2161.44 --> 2167.359
i mean empathy in general is kind of

2164.56 --> 2170.16
under attack for decades

2167.359 --> 2172.48
so it's not helping but it's really the

2170.16 --> 2174.7999999999997
moment

2172.48 --> 2176.72
it's like this period

2174.8 --> 2179.6800000000003
where the new

2176.72 --> 2180.9599999999996
psych like the summer is ending so yeah

2179.68 --> 2182.0789999999997
what's going to happen a whole bunch of

2180.96 --> 2184.2400000000002
people

2182.079 --> 2186.48
in the spring

2184.24 --> 2188.7999999999997
get a relationship like my friend in

2186.48 --> 2190.96
america also

2188.8 --> 2192.88
and

2190.96 --> 2194.8
it's like a summer love effect and then

2192.88 --> 2196.7200000000003
when the summer's over everybody has got

2194.8 --> 2198.88
got to get back to work suddenly it

2196.72 --> 2200.3999999999996
doesn't work anymore for one of the

2198.88 --> 2202.56
parties or both

2200.4 --> 2204.4
right that happens

2202.56 --> 2205.7599999999998
and then you have to deal with that and

2204.4 --> 2207.6800000000003
then you get a lot of breakups

2205.76 --> 2210.48
everywhere and

2207.68 --> 2210.48
yeah it sucks

2210.96 --> 2217.04
but that's not because of influences

2213.28 --> 2219.8390000000004
that is because of just life cycles

2217.04 --> 2223.2
vacation time versus

2219.839 --> 2225.359
school and work time

2223.2 --> 2229.839
etc

2225.359 --> 2229.839
and the mindsets that come with them

2239.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
who's breaking

2241.839 --> 2246.4
i don't know just random people out

2243.839 --> 2249.2799999999997
there like i can even hear people

2246.4 --> 2250.64
talking about it sometimes when they

2249.28 --> 2252.7200000000003
just

2250.64 --> 2254.64
walking by

2252.72 --> 2257.359
somewhere people that i don't know it

2254.64 --> 2258.96
just that [Â __Â ] is happening

2257.359 --> 2260.7999999999997
for some reason

2258.96 --> 2263.599
well i i mentioned the reason that i

2260.8 --> 2263.599
think it's happening

2266.96 --> 2273.119
right but nobody that i know of online

2270.56 --> 2273.119
or anything

2279.04 --> 2282.04
right

2285.28 --> 2288.32
although who knows

2296.16 --> 2300.3199999999997
it's just they're yeah

2298.8 --> 2302.1600000000003
there is something playing in the

2300.32 --> 2304.32
background i i don't want to talk about

2302.16 --> 2304.3199999999997
it

2304.96 --> 2308.64
i don't want to

2306.8 --> 2310.7200000000003
put

2308.64 --> 2312.56
like keep you hanging

2310.72 --> 2316.56
because i'm already keeping myself

2312.56 --> 2316.56
hanging there and we'll just find out

2316.64 --> 2319.7599999999998
should be soon enough

2322.56 --> 2325.56
uh

2329.359 --> 2335.48
taylor swift is telling girls but yeah

2331.599 --> 2335.48
taylor swift is a [Â __Â ]

2347.68 --> 2353.359
but anyway like seriously just think

2350.72 --> 2354.3999999999996
about it taylor swift is telling girls

2353.359 --> 2356.16
to break up

2354.4 --> 2358.4
well

2356.16 --> 2361.44
what kind of girl do you have to be if

2358.4 --> 2365.76
you're actually gonna do it

2361.44 --> 2365.76
like superficially because some stupid

2365.839 --> 2369.839
pop idol

2367.28 --> 2372.4
tells you to right it's not really going

2369.839 --> 2375.04
to be a great type of woman or a girl

2372.4 --> 2377.2000000000003
that's actually going to do that so

2375.04 --> 2379.2
maybe their boyfriends are going to be

2377.2 --> 2380.0
better off anyway

2379.2 --> 2382.64
because

2380.0 --> 2385.44
they're a shallow [Â __Â ]

2382.64 --> 2385.44
if they do that

2395.28 --> 2399.3590000000004
right you you might want to look for

2397.28 --> 2403.119
somebody that is a little bit more

2399.359 --> 2403.119
invested in their relationships

2406.0 --> 2410.64
unless you like that unless you want

2407.839 --> 2412.24
that it's like oh finally

2410.64 --> 2414.56
i don't have to tell her i don't really

2412.24 --> 2417.359
care about her i just did it for the sex

2414.56 --> 2417.359
anyway oh

2420.24 --> 2423.56
who knows

2436.88 --> 2439.839
finest

2442.0 --> 2445.24
you think

2486.56 --> 2489.52
hey voynich

2490.0 --> 2493.48
it's been a while

2496.24 --> 2503.0
oh by the way also humble bee

2498.96 --> 2503.0
i haven't seen you here before

2518.319 --> 2523.52
yeah i know eric's cursive man but it's

2520.88 --> 2524.88
very obvious why you know

2523.52 --> 2528.16
because if

2524.88 --> 2529.76
relationships are just transitory

2528.16 --> 2530.96
and disposable

2529.76 --> 2533.44
then

2530.96 --> 2535.68
yeah that means that there's not going

2533.44 --> 2538.2400000000002
to be any family

2535.68 --> 2541.2799999999997
life forming because of that right there

2538.24 --> 2543.4399999999996
might be like still special

2541.28 --> 2545.2000000000003
like oh i want a kid it's just mine i

2543.44 --> 2546.0
don't want a new man or whatever yeah

2545.2 --> 2547.5989999999997
that's

2546.0 --> 2550.68
brilliant

2547.599 --> 2550.6800000000003
all right

2552.319 --> 2556.72
it's gonna

2554.56 --> 2560.56
basically cause a whole bunch of people

2556.72 --> 2562.56
to avoid family units

2560.56 --> 2565.839
that's

2562.56 --> 2568.4
not very good on the long run

2565.839 --> 2569.44
they all will be sorry but they might be

2568.4 --> 2572.1600000000003
too

2569.44 --> 2575.7200000000003
prideful eventually when they find out

2572.16 --> 2575.72
to admit it

2582.96 --> 2588.16
subscribers now yeah i did get a couple

2585.52 --> 2592.2
of subscribers i don't know why what

2588.16 --> 2592.2
spurred that but it's cool

2595.52 --> 2598.52
2042.

2602.48 --> 2607.2
so yeah they're definitely see the the

2604.319 --> 2609.2
break is off it it seems like

2607.2 --> 2611.5989999999997
you all know that's not going back to

2609.2 --> 2613.68
underneath 2000 there's no way

2611.599 --> 2617.2000000000003
so yeah that's nice i've got a bit of a

2613.68 --> 2617.2
steady grow why not

2618.72 --> 2623.359
does the arch have something to do with

2620.24 --> 2623.359
free energy no

2628.72 --> 2633.24
hello moon shadow good to see you

2643.52 --> 2647.28
ah

2644.4 --> 2649.119
okay well good to hear humble be

2647.28 --> 2651.52
it's okay you don't really have to speak

2649.119 --> 2654.0
up if you but if you're inspired to by

2651.52 --> 2654.0
all means

2654.319 --> 2658.24
you saw me through nathan's that's

2655.839 --> 2658.24
awesome

2660.8 --> 2666.0
nathan's show is getting around man

2663.839 --> 2667.2
it's like it's getting attention from

2666.0 --> 2671.319
people

2667.2 --> 2671.319
people are picking up on it

2683.44 --> 2686.44
hmm

2692.319 --> 2694.64
right

2702.96 --> 2705.839
did i

2707.2 --> 2712.64
i have watched made by jim bob's live

2710.0 --> 2715.2
stream yesterday which is great like i

2712.64 --> 2717.1189999999997
i'm really digging his streams

2715.2 --> 2719.04
but i think that was exactly the same

2717.119 --> 2722.4
time as mitchell from australia so i

2719.04 --> 2722.4
think i might have missed it

2723.599 --> 2727.28
it's very tough when

2725.839 --> 2729.2799999999997
people

2727.28 --> 2733.1600000000003
that both have great streams start to

2729.28 --> 2733.1600000000003
stream at the same time

2733.52 --> 2738.96
no wait i did yeah what am i talking

2736.0 --> 2738.96
about i was there

2739.92 --> 2743.6800000000003
i already voted it up

2744.8 --> 2747.8390000000004
and was over the lake

2751.28 --> 2755.6800000000003
and of course huh i literally am now

2753.599 --> 2757.52
bumping into me saying about the

2755.68 --> 2759.44
spinning object so that's where i came

2757.52 --> 2761.119
up with it it wasn't mitchell from

2759.44 --> 2763.359
australia's show

2761.119 --> 2763.359
huh

2766.319 --> 2771.56
all right

2768.0 --> 2771.56
and now i know

2778.4 --> 2781.4
so

2805.04 --> 2807.7599999999998
right anyway

2813.18 --> 2816.3999999999996
[Music]

2814.88 --> 2817.28
right

2816.4 --> 2819.44
yeah

2817.28 --> 2821.6800000000003
mechanically the title doesn't really

2819.44 --> 2822.48
yield a whole bunch of conversation i

2821.68 --> 2825.2
think

2822.48 --> 2827.68
i was just wondering like

2825.2 --> 2829.4399999999996
i'm right about this right

2827.68 --> 2832.0789999999997
because that

2829.44 --> 2834.319
that's how it should work

2832.079 --> 2836.6400000000003
unless there has been a demonstration

2834.319 --> 2839.04
where there is like an internal spin

2836.64 --> 2843.0
possible somehow in a vacuum

2839.04 --> 2843.0
without physical reinforcement

2844.0 --> 2848.88
of any sort but

2846.0 --> 2848.88
i don't think so

2853.2 --> 2856.2
okay

2870.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
buy one big house

2875.119 --> 2881.839
right yeah eric's curse man

2877.599 --> 2881.839
you know there are complications though

2882.88 --> 2887.44
because

2884.559 --> 2889.6800000000003
in this age in this age of heavy media

2887.44 --> 2892.4
indoctrination

2889.68 --> 2894.0789999999997
and popular cults

2892.4 --> 2896.2400000000002
that's what they are

2894.079 --> 2898.6400000000003
there is so much

2896.24 --> 2901.4399999999996
bad behavior now in general it's like

2898.64 --> 2904.24
slipping in and like obsessions which

2901.44 --> 2907.44
also lead to bad behavior

2904.24 --> 2911.04
that it is now compared to say 100 years

2907.44 --> 2913.68
ago much tougher to actually

2911.04 --> 2916.48
like even with family all together live

2913.68 --> 2918.48
in a house unless you're like

2916.48 --> 2920.72
you still have like that old vibe going

2918.48 --> 2922.48
but that's pretty unique

2920.72 --> 2925.2
on average

2922.48 --> 2928.2400000000002
right 100 years ago to pack like an

2925.2 --> 2930.48
entire family with several branches in

2928.24 --> 2932.319
in a giant mansion

2930.48 --> 2933.839
would actually work

2932.319 --> 2935.68
and that did actually happen and

2933.839 --> 2937.359
everybody would respect each other and

2935.68 --> 2940.16
all that

2937.359 --> 2942.7999999999997
and do some careful social control with

2940.16 --> 2945.68
each other nowadays

2942.8 --> 2947.44
people tend to like try to avoid it's

2945.68 --> 2949.04
like oh no i don't want to deal

2947.44 --> 2951.2000000000003
constantly with them

2949.04 --> 2953.7599999999998
yapping on about this

2951.2 --> 2956.3999999999996
niche obsession they have or something

2953.76 --> 2958.6400000000003
right so it is more complicated to

2956.4 --> 2962.2400000000002
actually achieve that setup successfully

2958.64 --> 2962.24
you have to be very careful

2964.079 --> 2967.92
with like house rules and all that

2969.76 --> 2972.079
right

2975.8 --> 2983.0
generational family connection

2979.44 --> 2983.0
is great what

2994.16 --> 2997.96
what are you talking about

3015.68 --> 3018.68
so

3052.96 --> 3055.839
okay

3057.68 --> 3061.48
you're responding to ares

3071.599 --> 3074.48
okay

3072.72 --> 3075.7599999999998
i don't really understand even what he

3074.48 --> 3077.92
meant

3075.76 --> 3080.0
rest ahead with

3077.92 --> 3081.6800000000003
like extended family

3080.0 --> 3086.359
like does that mean something that i

3081.68 --> 3086.359
don't think it means i i don't know

3118.559 --> 3122.96
i've been taught this like extended

3120.319 --> 3125.839
family well maybe it airs the cursor man

3122.96 --> 3125.839
maybe

3131.599 --> 3135.3590000000004
i don't know for sure but maybe there is

3133.76 --> 3137.6800000000003
a point to that

3135.359 --> 3139.839
in a way that we have been taught to

3137.68 --> 3143.68
kind of like

3139.839 --> 3143.68
overvalue privacy

3143.76 --> 3147.2000000000003
versus

3145.68 --> 3151.359
social control

3147.2 --> 3151.359
from our families specifically

3151.839 --> 3156.319
that is a thing that has been like

3154.4 --> 3160.0
programmed in

3156.319 --> 3162.8
from liberal sources like

3160.0 --> 3164.96
very far back even

3162.8 --> 3167.119
right

3164.96 --> 3168.319
so maybe

3167.119 --> 3170.559
yeah

3168.319 --> 3171.359
but i do really value my privacy in a

3170.559 --> 3172.559
way

3171.359 --> 3174.7999999999997
so

3172.559 --> 3178.0
but at the same time i also appreciate

3174.8 --> 3180.96
just local order

3178.0 --> 3182.8
and i don't mind other people

3180.96 --> 3184.4
being around

3182.8 --> 3186.6400000000003
too much

3184.4 --> 3186.64
like

3186.88 --> 3192.2400000000002
in a way it's actually better than just

3189.599 --> 3195.119
being all alone

3192.24 --> 3199.4399999999996
but maybe that's just me

3195.119 --> 3202.96
you don't need family control no it's

3199.44 --> 3205.839
it's not literal control it's just like

3202.96 --> 3208.559
reminders reminders of

3205.839 --> 3210.319
who you are what you do because your

3208.559 --> 3213.119
family knows you

3210.319 --> 3216.4
now you of course rest ahead

3213.119 --> 3220.7200000000003
don't have particularly suited family

3216.4 --> 3221.599
for that sort of thing so i understand

3220.72 --> 3223.5989999999997
right

3221.599 --> 3225.839
in this case we're not talking about oh

3223.599 --> 3228.1600000000003
let's put your family together in one

3225.839 --> 3229.68
house because i understand that you

3228.16 --> 3232.48
wouldn't be

3229.68 --> 3232.48
up for that

3232.88 --> 3235.88
right

3237.76 --> 3240.6400000000003
it's definitely not going to be for

3239.359 --> 3244.04
every

3240.64 --> 3244.04
type of family

3270.48 --> 3275.04
right and besides rasta

3272.559 --> 3276.799
maybe it's not you at this point that

3275.04 --> 3278.96
needs family control maybe it's your

3276.799 --> 3280.24
family that needs your control because

3278.96 --> 3281.92
they're out of control have you ever

3280.24 --> 3284.24
considered that

3281.92 --> 3286.48
i bet you have

3284.24 --> 3289.1189999999997
right so

3286.48 --> 3291.2
in when it comes to family control the

3289.119 --> 3293.359
one that is just

3291.2 --> 3296.48
the most clear-minded

3293.359 --> 3300.799
has the most the sense of responsibility

3296.48 --> 3300.799
is usually the one that takes the reins

3301.92 --> 3305.52
because

3303.04 --> 3307.7599999999998
others in the family will be like kind

3305.52 --> 3310.72
of longing for an order it makes the

3307.76 --> 3314.0
family feel cohesive and safe

3310.72 --> 3314.0
and reliable you see

3317.76 --> 3322.1600000000003
in that sense every family kind of does

3319.839 --> 3324.64
need an alpha

3322.16 --> 3324.64
character

3329.359 --> 3335.0789999999997
right a man of the house

3331.28 --> 3335.079
that's what it called traditionally

3358.0 --> 3361.52
well you see

3359.52 --> 3362.4
you can arrange

3361.52 --> 3364.319
such

3362.4 --> 3365.52
social connections however you like

3364.319 --> 3368.319
right

3365.52 --> 3372.319
it requires the right

3368.319 --> 3374.24
group of people and environment but

3372.319 --> 3377.92
you could have like a

3374.24 --> 3379.5989999999997
family order or you could have a

3377.92 --> 3381.44
neighborhood order

3379.599 --> 3383.3590000000004
where it's like okay everybody in the

3381.44 --> 3386.0
street

3383.359 --> 3388.4
like they're kind of close

3386.0 --> 3389.359
and then like everybody gets together

3388.4 --> 3391.92
for

3389.359 --> 3394.96
shared dinners and all that

3391.92 --> 3397.04
right that is also very similar to a

3394.96 --> 3398.799
family unit except it's a neighborhood

3397.04 --> 3401.359
unit

3398.799 --> 3402.64
and that system is by the way also

3401.359 --> 3406.319
technically

3402.64 --> 3408.64
what i think they're applying socially

3406.319 --> 3410.799
in bertaria and what owen benjamin is

3408.64 --> 3412.0789999999997
doing like he has his family units very

3410.799 --> 3414.16
tight

3412.079 --> 3416.48
but it's also like other families and

3414.16 --> 3419.839
get together and

3416.48 --> 3419.839
the neighborhood order

3426.48 --> 3431.04
it's funny because my parents used to

3428.559 --> 3434.4
have that for a bit when i was very

3431.04 --> 3436.079
young like up until i was five like in

3434.4 --> 3438.48
another

3436.079 --> 3439.2000000000003
area

3438.48 --> 3441.04
and

3439.2 --> 3442.72
yeah people did that it's like oh we

3441.04 --> 3444.96
come together there is and there was

3442.72 --> 3447.68
social control and eventually it did

3444.96 --> 3449.76
also get annoying right because

3447.68 --> 3451.839
there might be gammas there that are

3449.76 --> 3454.4
gonna get control freakish about other

3451.839 --> 3457.599
people try to get meddling that is very

3454.4 --> 3457.599
annoying when that happens

3458.24 --> 3462.64
right there has to be proper order it's

3460.559 --> 3464.3190000000004
not just oh let just everything

3462.64 --> 3466.48
everything is going to go automatically

3464.319 --> 3468.4
no no there has to be actual

3466.48 --> 3470.799
a good

3468.4 --> 3474.0
natural leader figure

3470.799 --> 3475.839
to also keep the gammas under control

3474.0 --> 3478.4
that will arise

3475.839 --> 3478.4
usually

3480.24 --> 3484.8799999999997
or might slip in

3483.28 --> 3486.559
like

3484.88 --> 3488.6400000000003
who knows like some

3486.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
one of the girls in the one of the

3488.64 --> 3491.92
families

3489.839 --> 3493.92
marries a husband that turns out to be a

3491.92 --> 3495.6800000000003
complete gamma and now everybody has to

3493.92 --> 3496.64
deal with that right something like that

3495.68 --> 3498.16
yeah

3496.64 --> 3500.96
that's just always going to happen it's

3498.16 --> 3505.2799999999997
never going to be a flawless growth

3500.96 --> 3505.28
right it's always going to be challenges

3509.52 --> 3514.92
anyway

3510.48 --> 3514.92
get off my lawn right

3525.44 --> 3530.68
there's no place for mystics in families

3527.68 --> 3530.68
today

3532.0 --> 3535.92
well there never really was though point

3534.88 --> 3537.92
each

3535.92 --> 3540.2400000000002
there never really was that's the tricky

3537.92 --> 3540.2400000000002
part

3540.559 --> 3544.799
because a real mystic is always going to

3542.559 --> 3548.079
be kind of a loner

3544.799 --> 3552.16
and they can even like just

3548.079 --> 3552.1600000000003
you have like the big compound

3552.96 --> 3556.4
where everybody gets together and the

3554.72 --> 3558.5589999999997
dinner and all that

3556.4 --> 3560.7200000000003
and then sometimes you have like the

3558.559 --> 3562.799
cabin a little bit further away and

3560.72 --> 3564.0789999999997
that's where the

3562.799 --> 3566.079
the mystic

3564.079 --> 3567.76
or hermit is gonna live

3566.079 --> 3570.319
because they want to be part of the fact

3567.76 --> 3573.0400000000004
it's just that they really need their

3570.319 --> 3575.2
they're quiet and everybody would know

3573.04 --> 3577.359
that and then it's like okay

3575.2 --> 3578.72
somebody in there there's like something

3577.359 --> 3581.04
happening

3578.72 --> 3584.24
it's complicated and then they know oh

3581.04 --> 3587.839
right we should ask the family hermit

3584.24 --> 3587.839
because they're freaking smart

3587.92 --> 3590.7200000000003
and this is something we could bother

3589.599 --> 3592.88
him with

3590.72 --> 3596.9599999999996
right that

3592.88 --> 3599.96
that's always been there always

3596.96 --> 3599.96
right

3603.2 --> 3607.7599999999998
right and sometimes they would be the

3604.72 --> 3610.24
black sheep if they were out of control

3607.76 --> 3612.48
if they like got really anti-social and

3610.24 --> 3614.72
like weird

3612.48 --> 3616.799
beast behavior like and [Â __Â ] and then

3614.72 --> 3618.48
they would like okay just

3616.799 --> 3621.68
don't go there

3618.48 --> 3624.079
that guy yeah he's just

3621.68 --> 3626.64
he's possessed or something and we leave

3624.079 --> 3628.799
him alone so you leave him alone or we

3626.64 --> 3630.72
might get into crazy situations like

3628.799 --> 3632.079
that could happen too

3630.72 --> 3633.7599999999998
right

3632.079 --> 3636.319
you never really know how it's all going

3633.76 --> 3636.3190000000004
to turn out

3639.52 --> 3643.839
i feel like you're talking about me

3644.96 --> 3647.68
maybe i am

3655.2 --> 3659.2799999999997
that that's right they have solitude to

3656.88 --> 3660.7200000000003
think clearly

3659.28 --> 3664.96
because that is what it required it

3660.72 --> 3664.9599999999996
requires peace of mind stillness

3665.44 --> 3671.359
otherwise the noise of the entanglements

3668.559 --> 3674.0
is gonna blur it up and you'll never

3671.359 --> 3677.119
reach that

3674.0 --> 3680.16
right and most family members

3677.119 --> 3682.559
won't want to reach that they like

3680.16 --> 3686.0789999999997
they like the flow of it right they

3682.559 --> 3688.7200000000003
don't want that like peak inside

3686.079 --> 3690.4
but everybody in times of like

3688.72 --> 3692.72
complications

3690.4 --> 3695.599
most people do appreciate having

3692.72 --> 3697.9199999999996
somebody like that around somewhere

3695.599 --> 3700.319
it's like that's when they all come to

3697.92 --> 3702.96
your door like oh we got a situation do

3700.319 --> 3702.96
you know what to do

3704.0 --> 3707.0
right

3722.0 --> 3725.48
oh jesus

3726.559 --> 3729.6800000000003
gaining wisdom that is

3734.079 --> 3737.7200000000003
that's heavy man

3766.96 --> 3771.92
yeah i agree george sanford

3769.359 --> 3774.16
no respect for elders is is terrible i

3771.92 --> 3774.16
mean

3775.52 --> 3780.48
if you have trouble dealing with it

3778.24 --> 3780.4799999999996
that

3780.64 --> 3785.52
is not preferable it's not good but it's

3783.52 --> 3786.48
understandable but if you like i don't

3785.52 --> 3788.48
wanna

3786.48 --> 3792.799
and then hate on them that's

3788.48 --> 3792.799
terrible it is terrible it's nasty

3793.28 --> 3796.7200000000003
it's a real

3794.559 --> 3799.44
failure of character

3796.72 --> 3803.2
in my opinion

3799.44 --> 3803.2000000000003
those who failed before us well

3803.28 --> 3808.079
yeah maybe

3805.599 --> 3811.48
right you don't have to respect them for

3808.079 --> 3811.48
their shortcomings

3812.0 --> 3816.96
you know

3814.16 --> 3819.52
but they're still just human beings

3816.96 --> 3821.52
most of them

3819.52 --> 3824.4
don't get uttered that's right it does

3821.52 --> 3827.599
depend on what their radiation is like

3824.4 --> 3827.599
how their attitude is

3828.72 --> 3833.359
of course

3830.0 --> 3837.0
they're always just bastards

3833.359 --> 3837.0
you know that's different

3842.16 --> 3845.839
that's right dusty ryder elders just got

3844.16 --> 3848.3999999999996
brainwashed before us

3845.839 --> 3850.4
they all got brainwashed

3848.4 --> 3853.839
one way or the other

3850.4 --> 3853.839
and then when you grow older

3854.079 --> 3858.4
especially if you haven't been able to

3856.48 --> 3860.48
truly face it

3858.4 --> 3864.52
which is much more difficult back then

3860.48 --> 3864.52
because people were not

3866.079 --> 3870.4
it wasn't all

3867.92 --> 3873.119
that easy to figure out the spells back

3870.4 --> 3875.839
then right

3873.119 --> 3879.6400000000003
we got the internet now it's easier for

3875.839 --> 3879.64
us to catch on

3880.799 --> 3883.92
and then they can get stuck in their

3882.559 --> 3885.8390000000004
programming

3883.92 --> 3888.559
like very neurotically and then like

3885.839 --> 3890.16
they will just like no no

3888.559 --> 3891.6800000000003
i'm never gonna

3890.16 --> 3893.839
i'm never gonna say the moon landing is

3891.68 --> 3897.1189999999997
fake

3893.839 --> 3898.88
yeah that can be annoying as [Â __Â ]

3897.119 --> 3902.559
but that doesn't mean that you should

3898.88 --> 3905.599
hate on them for that right

3902.559 --> 3905.599
because they're freaking old

3907.68 --> 3913.0389999999998
right maybe it just really really breaks

3910.559 --> 3913.039
their heart

3913.119 --> 3919.28
so they have to be defensive about it

3915.28 --> 3919.28
right don't don't push it on them

3920.319 --> 3926.079
but don't try to pander to the illusion

3923.68 --> 3926.0789999999997
either

3930.4 --> 3934.799
right don't make their delusion your

3932.799 --> 3938.88
world

3934.799 --> 3938.88
i think that most people don't do that

3948.48 --> 3952.96
all doesn't equal wise well it's not

3951.119 --> 3955.2000000000003
automatically

3952.96 --> 3955.2
right

3960.72 --> 3966.24
but yeah those that make it

3964.319 --> 3969.119
those that do spiritually grow

3966.24 --> 3970.9599999999996
throughout their life even at old age

3969.119 --> 3973.52
they do have wisdom

3970.96 --> 3975.119
but they are very different types of

3973.52 --> 3977.0389999999998
people as

3975.119 --> 3979.2000000000003
people that don't succeed at that that

3977.039 --> 3981.92
kind of stumble spiritually

3979.2 --> 3983.9199999999996
that grow old

3981.92 --> 3986.0
and they're like lost that's what they

3983.92 --> 3990.2400000000002
typically look like but the really wise

3986.0 --> 3990.24
ones they're like they have like these

3991.28 --> 3995.6800000000003
sometimes almost like arkhan spirit

3994.079 --> 3998.2400000000002
they're so strong

3995.68 --> 4000.5589999999997
and wise and like very

3998.24 --> 4002.4799999999996
focused and healthy a lot of the times

4000.559 --> 4004.0
much more healthy

4002.48 --> 4007.0
than those that don't

4004.0 --> 4007.0
succeed

4012.48 --> 4016.2400000000002
i'm old as dirt already

4017.359 --> 4020.5989999999997
all right

4021.039 --> 4025.44
well 45 is one-third there to me

4032.839 --> 4038.799
maybe hmm

4035.2 --> 4040.799
hey puglies pugsley love joy

4038.799 --> 4043.0389999999998
don't make their world your

4040.799 --> 4045.0389999999998
their delusion your world yeah

4043.039 --> 4047.44
it is a good saying i agree

4045.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
is actually worth making a title of it

4047.44 --> 4049.839
too

4065.44 --> 4068.44
hmm

4084.64 --> 4088.8799999999997
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

4087.039 --> 4091.8390000000004

you just prepped a jamaican oxtail

4096.88 --> 4100.159000000001
seriously mon now i gotta play the song

4099.12 --> 4102.64

4102.64 --> 4105.839
i'm gonna play the song again

4111.44 --> 4114.978999999999
i think that

4113.6 --> 4127.04
very fitting

4114.979 --> 4132.12
[Music]

4127.04 --> 4132.12
it's all in a day's work

4137.46 --> 4143.909
[Music]

4148.319 --> 4154.88

4151.679 --> 4159.88
value of r maybe not far enough because

4154.88 --> 4159.88
we're calling you bluff black swan

4163.92 --> 4169.4400000000005

[Music]

4169.44 --> 4173.639999999999

4185.52 --> 4192.56

reification is your scapegoat

4192.56 --> 4198.8
let it go you've gone too far with your

4196.08 --> 4203.159
value of art maybe not far enough

4198.8 --> 4203.159000000001
because we're calling your bluff

satin

hell pseudo-christian plastic i don't

4315.76 --> 4320.280000000001
know what you're talking about or asked

4317.28 --> 4320.28
ahead

4337.76 --> 4340.76
hmm

4379.76 --> 4384.719
do you have the flat earth appointed no

4382.88 --> 4386.8
i don't have a

4384.719 --> 4389.92
smartphone

4386.8 --> 4392.8
so no i don't

4389.92 --> 4394.4
but i've seen good things about it

4392.8 --> 4397.28
right

4394.4 --> 4398.96
so if you do have a smartphone

4397.28 --> 4402.32
then yeah

4398.96 --> 4402.32
get the david weiss

4402.96 --> 4409.76
sun moon stars and

4406.159 --> 4411.44
flat earth sun moon and stars zodiac app

4409.76 --> 4412.400000000001
i might have missed one word in there

4411.44 --> 4413.678999999999
it's

4412.4 --> 4415.92
i can never

4413.679 --> 4419.12
remember it by heart but yeah

4415.92 --> 4419.12
it seems to be a good app

4419.52 --> 4423.040000000001
and there's like a

4421.12 --> 4426.36
friend finder on there too so that's

4423.04 --> 4426.36
kind of cool

4439.679 --> 4443.52
that's right aries cursive man that's a

4441.679 --> 4445.28
good one

4443.52 --> 4448.2390000000005
yeah

4445.28 --> 4450.88
nuclear family can be ruined by the

4448.239 --> 4454.718999999999
breadwinner suddenly losing their job

4450.88 --> 4457.84
can be ruined an extended family

4454.719 --> 4460.159
well the family is the insurance policy

4457.84 --> 4461.84
right if one branch

4460.159 --> 4463.839999999999
suddenly snaps

4461.84 --> 4464.88
there's still other branches to keep it

4463.84 --> 4467.28
all up

4464.88 --> 4469.4400000000005
and then yeah that person can

4467.28 --> 4472.08
potentially start up again

4469.44 --> 4472.08
grow anew

4474.48 --> 4481.879999999999
it's much more dynamic like that

4477.679 --> 4481.88
with like multiple breadwinners

4492.239 --> 4496.799999999999
why slow mode because of trolls

4494.84 --> 4501.08
sometimes their

4496.8 --> 4501.08
private vendor builds

4522.08 --> 4527.12
satan was invented no it's a

4524.159 --> 4527.12
personification

4527.44 --> 4531.5199999999995
the effects of what satan stands for are

4530.48 --> 4532.32
real

4531.52 --> 4534.080000000001
though

4532.32 --> 4536.239
it's a

4534.08 --> 4539.84
it is an appointment in the design

4536.239 --> 4539.839999999999
that's what it really says

4540.48 --> 4546.4
is a grifter oh yeah see that's why the

4543.28 --> 4549.759999999999
slow mode see that's why that's why the

4546.4 --> 4553.32
slow mode because of people like you

4549.76 --> 4553.320000000001
and now you're gone

4559.84 --> 4563.12
no rest ahead

4565.679 --> 4569.679
and besides have you checked this app

4567.44 --> 4569.678999999999

4587.44 --> 4590.799999999999
stone he was the one that kind of gave

4589.199 --> 4595.08
me the push

4590.8 --> 4595.08
