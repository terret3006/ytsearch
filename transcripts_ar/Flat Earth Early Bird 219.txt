7.25 --> 37.32
[Music]

39.37 --> 46.61
good morning welcome to flatter the

43.25 --> 48.86
earlybird number 219 i'm your host

46.61 --> 50.66
Arwen and please before we start to show

48.86 --> 53.39
share it on any platform you deem fit

50.66 --> 55.19
and if you haven't already subscribed to

53.39 --> 56.75
my channel and hit the bell notification

55.19 --> 59.209999999999994
so you know when i'm going live which is

56.75 --> 62.93
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

59.21 --> 65.75
day so yeah also support my channel

62.93 --> 69.29
please and let me Harry if you want to

65.75 --> 71.06
get unblocked you know what to do so the

69.29 --> 74.33000000000001
weather today whoa

71.06 --> 78.5
this is big mix back it's really nice

74.33 --> 82.46
and hot right now but yeah in this

78.5 --> 87.2
morning I was up extremely early like 7

82.46 --> 88.759
o'clock and like a massive big cloud

87.2 --> 91.88
came over and there was even like a

88.759 --> 97.759
lightning storm and massive rain but

91.88 --> 102.94999999999999
yeah like I guess even before 12 o'clock

97.759 --> 106.789
it was gone so now it's really nice

102.95 --> 110.44
weather yeah

106.789 --> 115.99000000000001
the plants are sure appreciating it and

110.44 --> 118.88
and so is the grass growing very hard

115.99 --> 119.80999999999999
with this type of weather so yeah good

118.88 --> 126.89
to see you all

119.81 --> 133.09
let's see who's in Chad Cleary Lou Dell

126.89 --> 136.25
West Watson a GM ego playing an anchor

133.09 --> 143.47
Jeffrey Bell glacier drunken bullet for

136.25 --> 143.47
one one Sean G James Mason

149.71 --> 152.71
yeah

153.73 --> 156.26899999999998
yeah

156.72 --> 168.01
yay so I went to bed really early like

166.09 --> 171.37
before 12 o'clock that was quite

168.01 --> 174.01
extraordinary but I I don't know I

171.37 --> 178.47
needed it and I kind of had it in my

174.01 --> 182.89
head like yeah I want to go to bed when

178.47 --> 186.07
no wait it was like ended up to being 1

182.89 --> 189.39999999999998
o'clock or something but I like with

186.07 --> 192.01
this heat I just want to sleep during

189.4 --> 194.35
the night because when the Sun's up it's

192.01 --> 197.5
just not doable it's too hot in the

194.35 --> 200.56
morning so I'm just trying to force

197.5 --> 203.95
myself to change my rhythm with this

200.56 --> 205.54
heat so I can at least yeah feel a

203.95 --> 209.26
little bit healthier because it was

205.54 --> 211.75
really taking its toll on me not being

209.26 --> 217.26999999999998
able to sleep properly the the second

211.75 --> 219.25
half of your sleep cycle right so I I

217.27 --> 221.44
don't have any Tamera coffee with me

219.25 --> 225.28
today I actually had the second cup of

221.44 --> 228.49
coffee a bit earlier and I didn't want

225.28 --> 231.49
to take a third one so I just only got

228.49 --> 233.98000000000002
tea and water probably gonna be taking a

231.49 --> 234.77
lot of water because the tea is too hot

233.98 --> 238.22899999999998
anyway

234.77 --> 238.229
[Music]

249.71 --> 260.46000000000004
yeah especially when it's this moist I

256.82 --> 263.73
tend to underestimate how dehydrated you

260.46 --> 266.54999999999995
can get from it air conditioner yeah

263.73 --> 269.46000000000004
that's nice that's really really nice

266.55 --> 271.35
that's not happening though and besides

269.46 --> 273.57
if I put an air conditioner in this one

271.35 --> 276.3
freaking room I'd literally freeze to

273.57 --> 281.7
death it would be extremely unhealthy I

276.3 --> 286.04
think no thanks air conditioners if is

281.7 --> 286.03999999999996
for people that have like entire houses

291.71 --> 301.14
yeah a GM or uber macaw or anyone please

296.75 --> 303.72
look I got Lenny Harry blocked so he

301.14 --> 307.2
doesn't show up not even in chats in the

303.72 --> 309.6
hangouts in the side of it so yeah just

307.2 --> 311.49
hide him if he keeps on trolling I

309.6 --> 314.28000000000003
already said to him look if you want to

311.49 --> 317.22
be unblocked you got to donate to my

314.28 --> 321.98999999999995
PayPal super Chad's not even gonna work

317.22 --> 325.37
if he's blocked so and if he just keeps

321.99 --> 331.61
on trolling just get him out of the way

325.37 --> 331.61
you knows what to do why is that

346.52 --> 360.65
okay the language of creation right

353.93 --> 360.65000000000003
that's yeah that's

365.58 --> 369.25899999999996
that's very nice and all

371.7 --> 379.26
yeah amazing it looks like eggs yeah

375.47 --> 381.42
it's one of those things where there's

379.26 --> 385.90999999999997
real elements to it and then there's a

381.42 --> 389.61
lot of filler which makes it extremely

385.91 --> 395.04
attention grabby and convoluted but

389.61 --> 396.81
maybe it's not can't say 100% sure

395.04 --> 405.03000000000003
without actually watching the video but

396.81 --> 408.35
just looking through the images but yeah

405.03 --> 412.61999999999995
I have been aware pretty much that

408.35 --> 415.77000000000004
language cybernetics like statistical

412.62 --> 417.51
word influences on society all that I

415.77 --> 421.28
know it's been out there for a long time

417.51 --> 421.28
I've even discussed it on this show

433.59 --> 443.65999999999997
yeah cymatics right I know I know

439.11 --> 443.66
cymatics can make something float look

444.71 --> 454.83
yeah Jeffrey Bell yeah I know it's very

448.68 --> 458.75
interesting yeah you know what I'll show

454.83 --> 461.46
it just just know that this is like the

458.75 --> 464.12
tenth time that I've been confronted

461.46 --> 467.12
with this so it to me it's kind of old

464.12 --> 467.12
but

474.36 --> 484.319
I'll show it anyway all right so this is

479.849 --> 487.53
a video from Jeffrey Blatt from D Murphy

484.319 --> 496.259
I didn't put on the sound but yeah this

487.53 --> 500.909
part basically shows how sound waves can

496.259 --> 505.91900000000004
basically create pressure locally to

500.909 --> 508.08
keep yeah certain things in place by

505.919 --> 512.0699999999999
having equal pressure in opposite

508.08 --> 516.06
directions at both sides of the matter

512.07 --> 518.399
and yeah they know how to control it

516.06 --> 521.3699999999999
they know how to steer the frequencies

518.399 --> 524.82
and create specific shapes and effects

521.37 --> 535.399
so they indeed can carry stuff like you

524.82 --> 539.49
can see right now goody

535.399 --> 541.73
so I'm Eric's just sound waves keeping

539.49 --> 541.73
it in place

545.48 --> 553.9
that's basically happening is that the

547.82 --> 557.36
unseen sound is like snares surrounding

553.9 --> 560.72
the air and in this case the objects

557.36 --> 563.42
pushing it to different directions it

560.72 --> 566.45
will be very audible and not put it yeah

563.42 --> 568.67
turning on the sound and then yeah

566.45 --> 572.69
because you don't see the air do that

568.67 --> 575.81
but you do see particles do that so yeah

572.69 --> 580.2800000000001
that's interesting and also if you

575.81 --> 584.1199999999999
consider that that would probably even

580.28 --> 587.42
just work if you put smoke in the air

584.12 --> 590.3
that smoke would started you would they

587.42 --> 592.5799999999999
should do that with smoke because with

590.3 --> 595.04
the smoke you would actually see the

592.58 --> 598.1
full patterns manifesting within the air

595.04 --> 603.31
I'm pretty certain of it that would be

598.1 --> 603.3100000000001
very fascinating but yeah cymatics

607.03 --> 610.8399999999999
getting creative with sound

618.17 --> 621.3399999999999
I know I was a

632.399 --> 639.569
yeah Pete from work that's really nice

636.24 --> 644.279
calling him pissy Dave and oh and yeah

639.569 --> 648.3
look don't be a troll you are probably a

644.279 --> 651.18
troll but yeah Dave just makes a certain

648.3 --> 653.9699999999999
type of videos and they are attention

651.18 --> 657.809
grabby and they are convoluted doesn't

653.97 --> 664.4390000000001
make the foundations and the data not

657.809 --> 673.8
real though it's just it's not very

664.439 --> 676.2199999999999
grounded but most most people have that

673.8 --> 676.2199999999999
yep

693.11 --> 701.33
oh really see on G gravities of force

698.44 --> 706.97
he's still suffering under the cognitive

701.33 --> 710.63
dissonance here or are you gonna say hey

706.97 --> 713.02
look go for a very very long yeah sure

710.63 --> 716.45
look that makes so much sense like ooh

713.02 --> 720.65
but you do realize that basically the

716.45 --> 722.26
globe side is now pretty much in

720.65 --> 724.97
division here

722.26 --> 726.83
cognitively like literal cognitive

724.97 --> 729.2
dissonance manifesting and now

726.83 --> 731.1800000000001
rearranging itself crystallizing the

729.2 --> 735.1400000000001
cognitive dissonance and the positions

731.18 --> 736.9399999999999
of it within the baller community and

735.14 --> 739.01
you're not used to that because you're

736.94 --> 743.0300000000001
also uniform so everybody just now

739.01 --> 744.3199999999999
starts to spiral insanely get more

743.03 --> 747.14
agitated about it

744.32 --> 748.6400000000001
look we're we flat earthers are used to

747.14 --> 751.1899999999999
that [ __ ] everybody has their own

748.64 --> 755.84
separate ideas there's nobody making us

751.19 --> 758.0300000000001
think alike at all we don't need that we

755.84 --> 761.98
don't have peer pressure systems based

758.03 --> 769.3399999999999
on that [ __ ] we just like colleagues

761.98 --> 771.9200000000001
like I'm the same size but only yeah if

769.34 --> 773.3000000000001
it suits us or if if there's a chemistry

771.92 --> 775.55
if there's a friendship if there's

773.3 --> 777.29
anything to gain from it you're not just

775.55 --> 779.4799999999999
gonna deal with people that you don't

777.29 --> 781.99
like unless there's something to gain

779.48 --> 781.99
from it

791.02 --> 798.49
the right atypical Glover sure yeah but

794.74 --> 800.95
just saying it is now divided so yeah

798.49 --> 803.38
you separate yourself that's actually

800.95 --> 805.3900000000001
that's the first step you need to do in

803.38 --> 810.28
order to even be able to wake up to the

805.39 --> 812.4399999999999
truth it's become the individual start

810.28 --> 815.23
to get your own ideas and then you will

812.44 --> 821.11
in the process in the freedom of

815.23 --> 826.09
actually not being guided by peers and

821.11 --> 829.33
priests you will accidentally be able to

826.09 --> 833.26
stumble upon more issues with the globe

829.33 --> 836.08
and start to then awaken to the

833.26 --> 839.67
cognitive dissonance spell so that's

836.08 --> 839.6700000000001
good it's a start

842.01 --> 849.76
it's not like the globus or the globe

846.99 --> 852.76
the globe religion let's just call it

849.76 --> 854.86
it's not uniform for nothing for no good

852.76 --> 856.78
reason it's like that because that's the

854.86 --> 859.14
only way it can keep on functioning

856.78 --> 859.14
really

866.3 --> 872.3
so yeah you're basically losing the

869.3 --> 873.9499999999999
fight it in the wider picture even

872.3 --> 877.64
though you're winning the fight for

873.95 --> 879.5
yourself as an individual so yeah the

877.64 --> 882.62
funny thing is you know with gravity you

879.5 --> 886.67
it's a force it's not a force it there's

882.62 --> 891.26
nothing or there has to be something we

886.67 --> 894.3199999999999
can deduce things or we simply look at

891.26 --> 897.56
it as a framework that's based on the

894.32 --> 901.37
conceptual medium or yeah a conceptual

897.56 --> 905.8399999999999
thing that's not actually anything it's

901.37 --> 910.48
conceptual or you could just yeah bypass

905.84 --> 913.13
that conceptual basis and go with more

910.48 --> 915.26
scientifically provable concepts like

913.13 --> 920.42
relative density and build up from there

915.26 --> 926.21
on and I can definitely claim force it's

920.42 --> 928.6999999999999
delicious and it's it works like even

926.21 --> 932.57
and surprisingly so I expected more

928.7 --> 935.86
resistance but even quantum eraser kind

932.57 --> 939.1400000000001
of a well he's basically applauded me

935.86 --> 941.8100000000001
sort of didn't really win against me

939.14 --> 943.49
when I said look relative density

941.81 --> 947.8399999999999
disequilibrium providing enough

943.49 --> 951.14
maneuverability manifests force in the

947.84 --> 953.24
form of acceleration resisted yeah

951.14 --> 958.34
countered by the resistance of the

953.24 --> 961.82
medium in which it is in which the the

958.34 --> 965.33
the thing is traveling and when there's

961.82 --> 967.2800000000001
no more maneuverability than yeah it

965.33 --> 971.84
will stop moving there will be an impact

967.28 --> 974.24
because of that and it will from their

971.84 --> 975.9200000000001
own translate into pressure localized

974.24 --> 978.14
because it can no longer burn over and

975.92 --> 980.18
that force because the object within the

978.14 --> 983.06
entire medium is still within the second

980.18 --> 986.3599999999999
if this equilibrium unless it was

983.06 --> 991.0699999999999
literally suspending in material that

986.36 --> 993.75
had its own density so as long as that's

991.07 --> 998.279
not the case any object with

993.75 --> 1000.5
mass weight is going to then with lack

998.279 --> 1006.1
of maneuverability create that pressure

1000.5 --> 1009.949
so that is my force and pressure

1006.1 --> 1012.649
redistribution framework to replace

1009.949 --> 1015.439
gravity pretty much everything about

1012.649 --> 1019.24
gravity I kind of like even managed to

1015.439 --> 1023.209
bypass all the aberrations about it I'm

1019.24 --> 1026.74
maybe be a bit preemptively proud of

1023.209 --> 1034.01
myself but I think I managed to do it

1026.74 --> 1040.52
it works out quantum eraser doesn't like

1034.01 --> 1042.199
it but it doesn't like anything new he

1040.52 --> 1045.02
likes to just keep things the way they

1042.199 --> 1047.75
are he doesn't like me challenging

1045.02 --> 1049.8799999999999
quantum mechanics in general he's like

1047.75 --> 1051.83
in love with that [ __ ] so it's gonna end

1049.88 --> 1056.67
up a war no matter what I'm pretty damn

1051.83 --> 1058.96
sure of it because it's personal to him

1056.67 --> 1062.27
[Music]

1058.96 --> 1068.0
but yeah I don't care there's there's

1062.27 --> 1070.429
really nothing nothing he can do so I'm

1068.0 --> 1073.01
just gonna proceed as I do and I'm gonna

1070.429 --> 1076.27
keep on move maneuvering and figuring

1073.01 --> 1076.27
things out as I do

1091.0 --> 1101.0
all right yeah hey hey you're concave

1095.69 --> 1104.42
piece of [ __ ] right if you're gonna go

1101.0 --> 1106.73
there with this sock creating spouting

1104.42 --> 1108.8000000000002
[ __ ] about me

1106.73 --> 1114.1100000000001
you're worse than Lodi if you keep this

1108.8 --> 1115.8799999999999
up you will be banned forever okay

1114.11 --> 1118.49
you've never actually contributed

1115.88 --> 1120.41
anything to my show why don't you why

1118.49 --> 1122.51
don't you start by sponsoring me and I

1120.41 --> 1125.18
might consider unlocking you but

1122.51 --> 1128.78
actually no I really don't

1125.18 --> 1130.8200000000002
you're just a spamming idiot and I'm

1128.78 --> 1134.48
totally sick of you and I'm gonna block

1130.82 --> 1137.57
every one of your socks just like a

1134.48 --> 1141.29
regular [ __ ] baller troll because

1137.57 --> 1143.77
you have nothing to contribute you have

1141.29 --> 1146.87
nothing to say you're like a freakin

1143.77 --> 1151.12
advertisement bought for your scientist

1146.87 --> 1151.12
and religion [ __ ] and I'm sick of it

1153.34 --> 1159.8
you know if you actually have something

1155.93 --> 1162.89
to say about concavity or whatever or

1159.8 --> 1164.96
your real arguments you know at least

1162.89 --> 1168.2900000000002
some of the ballers here like for

1164.96 --> 1174.68
example Daniel actually start to work it

1168.29 --> 1177.98
through and try to make arguments okay

1174.68 --> 1182.69
Jason McCormack never does that he's

1177.98 --> 1184.3700000000001
just a freakin caps spambot but he's

1182.69 --> 1187.03
actually a person which makes it very

1184.37 --> 1187.03
sad

1198.53 --> 1201.68
all right

1204.18 --> 1219.8100000000002
no no no no ya Russian button not

1212.63 --> 1230.2800000000002
actually Russian BOTS aren't that

1219.81 --> 1241.62
[ __ ] like they yeah they're too

1230.28 --> 1244.53
sophisticated to be that stupid now

1241.62 --> 1247.01
among all the BOTS and spam [ __ ] out

1244.53 --> 1250.3799999999999
there I'd actually prefer Russian BOTS

1247.01 --> 1252.6
unless they get like really hostile and

1250.38 --> 1255.8100000000002
I think that they some of them do do

1252.6 --> 1259.1399999999999
that so nah probably they wouldn't even

1255.81 --> 1262.3799999999999
need to there is already so much liberal

1259.14 --> 1264.63
insanity and BOTS and like really evil

1262.38 --> 1272.7
[ __ ] out there they don't need to do

1264.63 --> 1274.8000000000002
anything of that sort you know all that

1272.7 --> 1278.27
ugliness out there just makes them look

1274.8 --> 1278.27
better and better and better

1316.03 --> 1323.71
okay AJ I'm pleased yeah you're getting

1321.17 --> 1323.71
weird again

1323.98 --> 1330.79
hey hello amigo Barbosa welcome to the

1328.52 --> 1330.79
stream

1339.18 --> 1346.8600000000001
anga of tech or angel of tech yeah well

1343.68 --> 1350.22
you can tell if you pay a lot of

1346.86 --> 1353.1
attention it's almost like reading The

1350.22 --> 1355.68
Matrix you remember that like the lines

1353.1 --> 1359.2199999999998
and like these interfaces can read that

1355.68 --> 1362.0900000000001
[ __ ] well reading a lots of lots and

1359.22 --> 1364.3500000000001
lots of comments a lot of the time

1362.09 --> 1367.4399999999998
suddenly you suddenly get like a

1364.35 --> 1370.6799999999998
subconscious site for it you just

1367.44 --> 1373.8300000000002
recognize certain patterns very directly

1370.68 --> 1376.26
very instantly you recognize whether

1373.83 --> 1378.3899999999999
there is like an energy that is created

1376.26 --> 1381.33
that on the spot and how that works how

1378.39 --> 1385.38
the energy loops of that person works or

1381.33 --> 1389.76
if it's just a standard dead print I can

1385.38 --> 1392.5500000000002
just I have a feeling for it so it's not

1389.76 --> 1394.89
always right you know and yeah the

1392.55 --> 1396.8999999999999
problem is that real people trolls some

1394.89 --> 1400.3500000000001
of them can get so creative that they

1396.9 --> 1402.27
can even yeah they can act like all

1400.35 --> 1404.9699999999998
kinds of things mask themselves as all

1402.27 --> 1406.3799999999999
kind of things but an actual spambot and

1404.97 --> 1412.98
everything that's very easily

1406.38 --> 1417.8700000000001
recognizable all right and I look the

1412.98 --> 1420.75
the thing is I'm I can even sense when

1417.87 --> 1423.059
somebody is a specific troll when

1420.75 --> 1426.87
they're a sock completely anonymous of

1423.059 --> 1430.23
somebody because I'll recognize the

1426.87 --> 1432.6599999999999
energy you know how I do that because I

1430.23 --> 1434.94
still remember the energy from some kind

1432.66 --> 1436.2
of conflict that was right before that

1434.94 --> 1437.91
and most of these people are so

1436.2 --> 1442.2
predictable that if they get banned

1437.91 --> 1445.8000000000002
they'll immediately start spamming you

1442.2 --> 1448.47
and they'll try all kinds of tricks and

1445.8 --> 1450.96
they'll yeah every time you figure it

1448.47 --> 1453.51
out they'll just keep getting Stiller

1450.96 --> 1457.29
and quieter and nicer and and that

1453.51 --> 1459.21
energy is just very recognizable so if

1457.29 --> 1461.97
somebody starts sucking up very

1459.21 --> 1464.07
unexpectedly somebody new then

1461.97 --> 1467.4
immediately it's like okay this is a

1464.07 --> 1471.83
troll has to be nobody starts out doing

1467.4 --> 1471.8300000000002
that [ __ ] makes no damn sense

1485.85 --> 1488.6899999999998
that what

1493.12 --> 1500.9799999999998
Oh God

1497.52 --> 1504.72
right yeah a badge batch about math you

1500.98 --> 1509.17
know you know that maths fall under

1504.72 --> 1512.52
conceptual mechanics right just like

1509.17 --> 1517.63
astronomy and a lot of other things

1512.52 --> 1520.45
philosophy and that's very nice it you

1517.63 --> 1524.23
can build very reliable frameworks if

1520.45 --> 1527.8600000000001
you tinker hard enough on it with actual

1524.23 --> 1532.27
empirical data but the thing is it

1527.86 --> 1537.33
remains in a conceptual framework to

1532.27 --> 1540.25
basically emulate based on data and

1537.33 --> 1543.1
making certain connections within that

1540.25 --> 1546.19
data and then putting that down in a

1543.1 --> 1547.27
framework that's math doesn't make

1546.19 --> 1552.79
things real though

1547.27 --> 1556.06
if aspects key aspects of the math

1552.79 --> 1558.04
concepts are missing within the word

1556.06 --> 1561.04
empirical world if there's no actual

1558.04 --> 1566.3799999999999
physical data to back it up then it

1561.04 --> 1568.92
becomes pseudoscience definitively and

1566.38 --> 1574.68
that's one of the problems with gravity

1568.92 --> 1579.52
in and it cannot be bypassed it's still

1574.68 --> 1581.71
yeah even bizarre and trick trickery how

1579.52 --> 1584.8
it's supposed even they how people are a

1581.71 --> 1588.64
being able to measure it it all comes

1584.8 --> 1592.21
down to its attention weight based

1588.64 --> 1596.2
deduction and again you always using the

1592.21 --> 1598.8700000000001
same presupposition system so it doesn't

1596.2 --> 1600.67
it'll never work out it was designed not

1598.87 --> 1604.57
to work out it was designed as a

1600.67 --> 1607.96
framework to bypass the actual empirical

1604.57 --> 1611.47
mechanics that was that it's a ghost

1607.96 --> 1616.72
it's an aberration and it was embraced

1611.47 --> 1620.79
and not solved even though I think I

1616.72 --> 1620.79
almost completely solved it now

1622.98 --> 1627.45
and I probably haven't been the first

1627.75 --> 1630.94
[Music]

1637.08 --> 1643.87
[Music]

1639.65 --> 1643.8700000000001
so I hope that answers enough

1654.56 --> 1659.33
the peanuts Clark believe never really

1657.44 --> 1665.1200000000001
was part of the scientific method but

1659.33 --> 1669.35
belief is of course always there to

1665.12 --> 1673.8799999999999
progress with what the scientific method

1669.35 --> 1676.78
has yielded so far and you yeah you try

1673.88 --> 1676.7800000000002
to figure things out

1695.56 --> 1698.1599999999999
what

1699.46 --> 1704.5
why do you

1702.13 --> 1709.15
why are you bringing that up a gym

1704.5 --> 1717.1
that's really what do you think these

1709.15 --> 1721.65
not being framed are you serious I know

1717.1 --> 1725.1699999999998
it's all ridiculously overblown but not

1721.65 --> 1730.75
but I don't think that see that is the

1725.17 --> 1732.15
fall of that just liberal media's going

1730.75 --> 1734.71
nuts

1732.15 --> 1737.65
they are going there they are getting

1734.71 --> 1742.4
that stupid it doesn't make any sense

1737.65 --> 1745.5590000000002
for normal people but they are

1742.4 --> 1745.5590000000002
[Music]

1754.31 --> 1762.2
you know gravity oh you know it well

1759.43 --> 1764.0600000000002
look white bear it's all a matter of

1762.2 --> 1767.03
approach you know there is displacement

1764.06 --> 1769.94
going on right and where displacement is

1767.03 --> 1773.18
there force has to be there just like

1769.94 --> 1776.42
the Newton law and all that well yeah

1773.18 --> 1779.42
then there's flatter sale no it doesn't

1776.42 --> 1782.42
work it's no law because blah blah blah

1779.42 --> 1784.8500000000001
well I simply say okay it's no problem

1782.42 --> 1786.5900000000001
you just have to figure out what is

1784.85 --> 1788.8999999999999
actually causing all this displacement

1786.59 --> 1791.62
guess what it's relative density

1788.9 --> 1797.8100000000002
disequilibrium mm-hmm

1791.62 --> 1800.3899999999999
it causes it it causes the effects we've

1797.81 --> 1808.81
all learned in school to attribute to

1800.39 --> 1814.93
gravity all of it doesn't explain why

1808.81 --> 1817.9099999999999
density spectrum alignment all that yeah

1814.93 --> 1818.3
too bad doesn't really matter now does

1817.91 --> 1823.5500000000002
it

1818.3 --> 1827.24
we know it is there and hey if somebody

1823.55 --> 1830.99
really wants to know why well maybe one

1827.24 --> 1833.72
day we'll figure it out you know and who

1830.99 --> 1835.67
knows somebody might be able to find a

1833.72 --> 1839.77
cause for it and be able to fairly

1835.67 --> 1843.65
manipulate it and then basically proving

1839.77 --> 1846.23
what gravity actually is or the what now

1843.65 --> 1848.24
the ethereal concept of gravity is what

1846.23 --> 1848.9
is now simply attributed to relative

1848.24 --> 1851.57
density

1848.9 --> 1855.2900000000002
well maybe the relative density process

1851.57 --> 1859.58
could be varied and manipulated without

1855.29 --> 1861.68
changing the relative density and that

1859.58 --> 1864.4399999999998
the there would be an alignment shift

1861.68 --> 1867.92
and all that and hey if that could be

1864.44 --> 1872.3300000000002
caused without actual just basic motion

1867.92 --> 1874.64
causing displacement or relative density

1872.33 --> 1878.4499999999998
change causing the displacement well

1874.64 --> 1880.91
maybe then yeah the supposed gravity

1878.45 --> 1884.1200000000001
could finally be varied and manipulated

1880.91 --> 1887.1100000000001
and I'll bet you it's not gonna be

1884.12 --> 1890.6399999999999
turning out to be the classical gravity

1887.11 --> 1892.78
as we've been conceptualizing and

1890.64 --> 1894.7
Einstein in gravity doesn't even

1892.78 --> 1896.8899999999999
conceptualize what causes it just says

1894.7 --> 1900.04
no it just happens to be there and it

1896.89 --> 1902.89
causes other things so that's not an

1900.04 --> 1905.23
answer either Newton's pretty much been

1902.89 --> 1909.5200000000002
discarding mass mass attracting the mass

1905.23 --> 1911.41
is not really causing it so yeah who

1909.52 --> 1913.45
knows what is actually causing the

1911.41 --> 1916.21
alignment within the relative density

1913.45 --> 1919.21
spectrum we might find out one day but

1916.21 --> 1922.0
for now we can definitely scientifically

1919.21 --> 1928.26
prove that relative density is the cause

1922.0 --> 1928.26
of the displacement so yeah there you go

1942.72 --> 1950.52
little matrix media Jonathan Doherty

1946.23 --> 1954.44
southern pole star White Bear good to

1950.52 --> 1954.44
see you bear in here

1972.33 --> 1980.49
all right

1974.58 --> 1983.22
a downward factor well really the

1980.49 --> 1985.05
downward factor when you start to

1983.22 --> 1987.0
involve downward that's not really

1985.05 --> 1991.59
compatible with the relative density

1987.0 --> 1995.84
theory but if you say okay the alignment

1991.59 --> 1999.9299999999998
of it which is not singular because

1995.84 --> 2003.1399999999999
displacement is caused in either

1999.93 --> 2005.51
directions it's based on relative

2003.14 --> 2010.67
density so what causes that alignment I

2005.51 --> 2014.3
don't know one could presume or

2010.67 --> 2018.5600000000002
presuppose that gravity a standards

2014.3 --> 2020.78
force somehow applied downwards an

2018.56 --> 2021.1699999999998
apparent forces equilibrium could cause

2020.78 --> 2023.42
that

2021.17 --> 2028.3300000000002
oh yeah would work out great in modeling

2023.42 --> 2030.95
that's nice but as long as you don't

2028.33 --> 2034.6699999999998
very manipulate you can presuppose

2030.95 --> 2037.3400000000001
whatever you like doesn't prove anything

2034.67 --> 2042.7
it's just an ethereal concept it's a

2037.34 --> 2042.6999999999998
what if it's not solid evidence

2045.78 --> 2052.56
now that's not true Jonathan Dougherty

2048.35 --> 2054.75
relative density then this realm divides

2052.56 --> 2058.5299999999997
very specifically in accordance to an

2054.75 --> 2062.419
alignment that is how the forces

2058.53 --> 2062.4190000000003
manifest within that alignment

2070.35 --> 2080.6
oh snap

2087.95 --> 2095.549
yeah yeah by the way I think I might

2092.129 --> 2102.089
actually be finally completely beyond my

2095.549 --> 2107.0
stupid cold cuz yeah I had pain in my

2102.089 --> 2110.339
back it seems to be almost entirely gone

2107.0 --> 2116.73
so I think yeah wrong pipe indeed I

2110.339 --> 2118.8289999999997
think that hmm hopefully tomorrow or the

2116.73 --> 2121.38
day after it'll be gone completely and

2118.829 --> 2124.65
you know I am feeling incredibly

2121.38 --> 2126.6600000000003
Restless so that does make sense as I

2124.65 --> 2128.76
said it happens exactly when I get

2126.66 --> 2135.5989999999997
better it's just this giant boost and

2128.76 --> 2139.65
I'm actually quite agitated really but

2135.599 --> 2143.069
it's because of the well the in

2139.65 --> 2145.559
capability of basically letting this

2143.069 --> 2150.049
energy manifest because I'm still locked

2145.559 --> 2153.6600000000003
in here everything that I deal with and

2150.049 --> 2155.579
I'm being very pushy towards myself now

2153.66 --> 2156.93
because it's like that entity just like

2155.579 --> 2159.63
yeah get on with it

2156.93 --> 2166.279
like why no you're finally like gonna do

2159.63 --> 2166.279
something to get out of this this prison

2168.2 --> 2171.2
but

2172.099 --> 2175.099
yeah

2175.56 --> 2184.68
look a better mood I feel stronger

2180.42 --> 2188.1
okay I'm not as weak like this being

2184.68 --> 2190.41
sickly really can weaken me and that

2188.1 --> 2194.1
just drains me makes me tired a lot and

2190.41 --> 2199.5899999999997
I'm not weak but full of energy but not

2194.1 --> 2201.66
not a necessarily happy energy actually

2199.59 --> 2211.26
kind of filled with feelings of

2201.66 --> 2215.8799999999997
disappointment and I don't know weird

2211.26 --> 2218.34
need to lash out but yeah not it's not

2215.88 --> 2220.6800000000003
gonna even get close to it any kind of

2218.34 --> 2224.4500000000003
physical response it's just like a I

2220.68 --> 2224.45
don't know passive aggressiveness maybe

2226.01 --> 2232.05
maybe might have something to do that

2229.83 --> 2237.29
one of my roommates apparently found a

2232.05 --> 2239.78
girlfriend for the summer and yeah I can

2237.29 --> 2242.2799999999997
pretty much hear what they're doing

2239.78 --> 2244.9500000000003
doesn't really help a lot either

2242.28 --> 2248.1600000000003
although yeah he's a young guy I saw I

2244.95 --> 2252.29
was there too wanted you know yeah I'm

2248.16 --> 2252.29
not gonna complain to him buddy

2254.08 --> 2260.63
[Music]

2265.16 --> 2271.609
oh yeah yeah okay since you brought it

2269.119 --> 2275.359
up false flag with Iran definitely false

2271.609 --> 2281.029
flag like even the Alex Jones group says

2275.359 --> 2283.7889999999998
it it's like yeah you know and I really

2281.029 --> 2290.869
appreciate that he still does that look

2283.789 --> 2294.98
he has to of course but yeah what is it

2290.869 --> 2296.839
what is gonna happen cuz I don't know I

2294.98 --> 2300.259
don't get the feeling from Trump that

2296.839 --> 2303.319
he's being very like we gotta stop this

2300.259 --> 2306.7400000000002
from escalating with his like his

2303.319 --> 2309.079
bolstering like oh yeah where you could

2306.74 --> 2312.3489999999997
just nuke it all if we wanted that kind

2309.079 --> 2316.4300000000003
of [ __ ] I really don't like its

2312.349 --> 2318.619
geopolitical attitude it doesn't have

2316.43 --> 2321.859
anything to do with trust it's just that

2318.619 --> 2324.4700000000003
I don't like that face but at the same

2321.859 --> 2327.74
time I do not have a full understanding

2324.47 --> 2329.8689999999997
of the tactical reason why he's doing

2327.74 --> 2332.72
that because there must be some kind of

2329.869 --> 2336.38
tactical reason that maybe a little bit

2332.72 --> 2339.2
out of the Western Minds leaked it may

2336.38 --> 2343.9700000000003
simply be a non Western strategy that

2339.2 --> 2347.8689999999997
he's trying to apply in some way so but

2343.97 --> 2349.3999999999996
it feels shitty and I I really don't

2347.869 --> 2351.38
know if there's gonna be some kind of

2349.4 --> 2354.0190000000002
war I think it's just gonna be more

2351.38 --> 2358.339
attention look it seems more and more

2354.019 --> 2362.39
like Trump is applying military pressure

2358.339 --> 2364.4
or scare to rearrange business the

2362.39 --> 2366.6189999999997
business the geopolitical business world

2364.4 --> 2371.42
getting new deals all that that's what

2366.619 --> 2374.359
he's been doing mostly and he simply may

2371.42 --> 2376.91
be using this to just manipulate right

2374.359 --> 2380.66
ooh manipulate Europe and the Middle

2376.91 --> 2385.0
East and see maybe they're trying to

2380.66 --> 2388.0989999999997
make some group break as well or maybe

2385.0 --> 2390.92
an unexpected you don't really know with

2388.099 --> 2393.44
the US you don't really know but you do

2390.92 --> 2397.2690000000002
know they're probably gonna get come

2393.44 --> 2397.2690000000002
after somebody new after some point

2399.38 --> 2404.9700000000003
because I get the feeling that the

2402.51 --> 2407.2200000000003
entire world pretty much is aware of how

2404.97 --> 2411.3489999999997
America does things and they'll never

2407.22 --> 2415.6699999999996
really engage into anything seriously

2411.349 --> 2418.8900000000003
unless they have like a huge plan and I

2415.67 --> 2429.089
don't think anybody has that maybe

2418.89 --> 2434.0099999999998
Russia they would but yeah I get it it's

2429.089 --> 2436.8289999999997
really annoying with Iran and it's a lot

2434.01 --> 2439.46
of pushiness I don't think there's

2436.829 --> 2443.059
really anything coming out of that

2439.46 --> 2445.44
except more trade war [ __ ]

2443.059 --> 2448.5
what I am kind of curious about though

2445.44 --> 2452.849
is what's happening in Venezuela I did

2448.5 --> 2462.0
post a vote post a video earlier in the

2452.849 --> 2464.46
Skype NRT video that yeah that basically

2462.0 --> 2467.819
was a bit of an oversight of protests

2464.46 --> 2471.18
surrounding the world like in France and

2467.819 --> 2473.73
then what is it

2471.18 --> 2475.98
Kazakhstan even like regions I normally

2473.73 --> 2478.65
don't really look into a lot it was very

2475.98 --> 2481.88
interesting video I'll post it it's a

2478.65 --> 2484.88
it's a decent news report very neutral

2481.88 --> 2484.88
so

2488.019 --> 2493.3089999999997
but yeah I think that the Venezuela

2491.109 --> 2496.67
situation is not over yet

2493.309 --> 2499.789
but look the more and more this type of

2496.67 --> 2503.869
thing happens to me it starts to feel

2499.789 --> 2506.2090000000003
mostly most most of all and with the

2503.869 --> 2510.829
tactics and everything like a cold or

2506.209 --> 2515.799
like a semi cold war situation it's like

2510.829 --> 2515.799
cold war but still

2519.14 --> 2528.979
mostly based on business it's weird

2526.729 --> 2535.5789999999997
I don't know I think it I think it's

2528.979 --> 2538.9399999999996
like that so yeah it seems like there's

2535.579 --> 2543.2290000000003
just more fronts being created or

2538.94 --> 2548.509
there's gonna be ruckus and potential

2543.229 --> 2551.089
regime changes and like yeah all the

2548.509 --> 2554.329
Hawks basically sitting there hoping to

2551.089 --> 2558.44
get the deal out of it I think that's

2554.329 --> 2570.38
what's happening and in that sense yeah

2558.44 --> 2572.7490000000003
I think that I just you know there's

2570.38 --> 2575.539
enough people speculating about Trump

2572.749 --> 2577.3689999999997
and especially yeah we there that are

2575.539 --> 2582.1400000000003
much better informed I'm basically just

2577.369 --> 2588.8900000000003
I just don't know anymore what he's

2582.14 --> 2590.93
doing I just know that the whole setup

2588.89 --> 2593.359
for him looks really like that like you

2590.93 --> 2597.229
know old Chinese emperor being locked in

2593.359 --> 2600.8289999999997
by its cabinet that seems to be a setup

2597.229 --> 2608.359
whether that be on purpose or even

2600.829 --> 2611.7490000000003
arranged there's no way to tell you know

2608.359 --> 2615.0789999999997
in the end everything will everyone that

2611.749 --> 2616.999
is absolutely devious in this whole will

2615.079 --> 2619.219
damn well reveal themselves they can't

2616.999 --> 2620.9199999999996
help especially when they get real big

2619.219 --> 2626.989
control they will reveal themselves

2620.92 --> 2630.319
every one of them because technically

2626.989 --> 2633.529
that is what they're doing it for they

2630.319 --> 2638.209
that's they build up all that stress all

2633.529 --> 2640.369
that investment and that's that ego part

2638.209 --> 2645.16
is gonna have to avenge itself that's

2640.369 --> 2649.19
what happens that's what Lucifer does so

2645.16 --> 2650.96
but yeah at least for look there's so

2649.19 --> 2653.7200000000003
much going on in the world with the

2650.96 --> 2656.7200000000003
whole business maneuvering the

2653.72 --> 2659.75
geopolitics for a long time and because

2656.72 --> 2662.7799999999997
of Trump well America is basically not

2659.75 --> 2671.0
being turned into a third world that's

2662.78 --> 2675.3500000000004
the big difference but yeah at the same

2671.0 --> 2678.35
time it's not like the the crazy liberal

2675.35 --> 2682.19
agenda is being just halted in its

2678.35 --> 2685.73
tracks hard and I think a lot of people

2682.19 --> 2690.7000000000003
were hoping for that but no like Trump

2685.73 --> 2690.7
is being very liberal with the Liberals

2692.89 --> 2699.95
and that's it's almost like he's taking

2697.79 --> 2706.25
an underdog position in that and that

2699.95 --> 2709.0699999999997
just seems unnecessary and I think a lot

2706.25 --> 2712.58
of people are really agitated about that

2709.07 --> 2714.7400000000002
and that they express it like Alex Jones

2712.58 --> 2717.83
all these people on that show express

2714.74 --> 2720.5899999999997
their agitation about it quite honestly

2717.83 --> 2726.23
so and I appreciate that they do and

2720.59 --> 2727.4
it's yeah the guy is just on every front

2726.23 --> 2730.06
every fault

2727.4 --> 2730.06
it makes back

2737.079 --> 2743.619
yes South Africa needs a Trump maybe

2742.319 --> 2746.549
yeah

2743.619 --> 2746.549
something

2749.31 --> 2755.46
what I would say David read is what

2751.91 --> 2758.54
Africa mostly need is to be completely

2755.46 --> 2761.9700000000003
cut off from the liberal party system

2758.54 --> 2764.19
because they are from the rest of the

2761.97 --> 2766.58
world are feeding into that and

2764.19 --> 2770.81
strengthening these maniacs

2766.58 --> 2770.81
his racist maniacs

2777.3 --> 2786.1200000000003
but as long as that influx of support is

2781.88 --> 2789.6
coming yeah a singular rebellious

2786.12 --> 2791.67
president is gonna make I don't know

2789.6 --> 2796.13
doesn't stand much of a chance maybe he

2791.67 --> 2796.13
would but I don't know

2806.58 --> 2811.59
we'll see what happens you know the

2809.43 --> 2815.27
thing about it is that there's just this

2811.59 --> 2819.84
crazy group going and going down and

2815.27 --> 2821.94
being all satanic basically and that is

2819.84 --> 2824.8500000000004
ruckus in everything up and it's

2821.94 --> 2829.05
degrading everything but at the same

2824.85 --> 2833.5699999999997
time with these types of influences when

2829.05 --> 2838.8300000000004
it's gone it's gone because there is

2833.57 --> 2842.01
inevitably a huge backlash that must

2838.83 --> 2846.36
come it there's no other way it will

2842.01 --> 2848.94
happen and either happen with just yeah

2846.36 --> 2851.2200000000003
laws forbidding that kind of [ __ ] and

2848.94 --> 2854.55
that would feel a very liberal very

2851.22 --> 2856.47
right-wing but at that point I think a

2854.55 --> 2858.4700000000003
lot of people would say yeah if it's

2856.47 --> 2861.06
just to stop these freaks

2858.47 --> 2864.2099999999996
they'll yeah they'll allow that and

2861.06 --> 2870.11
that's really when everything is going

2864.21 --> 2874.23
to be screwed because that is when yeah

2870.11 --> 2878.31
certainly a lot of Liberty will be gone

2874.23 --> 2882.11
that's the crazy part about it and that

2878.31 --> 2885.06
is the final revenge for these freaks is

2882.11 --> 2889.88
that they're literally abusing the

2885.06 --> 2893.85
Liberty to make the Liberty disappear

2889.88 --> 2895.98
that's the well that is whether they

2893.85 --> 2899.5499999999997
some of these crazies realize it or not

2895.98 --> 2902.4
probably they do they probably do that

2899.55 --> 2906.57
they're literally being as insane and

2902.4 --> 2911.4300000000003
maniacal to destroy freedom that is the

2906.57 --> 2914.61
end purpose to get the backlash to make

2911.43 --> 2918.06
people sign on in a desperate counter

2914.61 --> 2921.06
spiritual movement to stop these maniacs

2918.06 --> 2922.95
from doing what they do and in such they

2921.06 --> 2929.04
will be everyone is going to be clamped

2922.95 --> 2931.5499999999997
down by that and then yeah what do you

2929.04 --> 2931.55
got then

2932.73 --> 2942.95
it's rife for yeah more empire maybe

2938.78 --> 2945.9900000000002
maybe not maybe it'll just be guided

2942.95 --> 2948.5099999999998
gradually down toned back but I don't

2945.99 --> 2951.24
know the look the powers that all men

2948.51 --> 2954.0
maneuver this [ __ ] it all made this

2951.24 --> 2957.99
happen are still out there their stare

2954.0 --> 2961.349
there they're still continuing building

2957.99 --> 2963.4799999999996
that plan that made all of this arrive

2961.349 --> 2966.75
in the first place you gotta realize it

2963.48 --> 2974.06
as long as the people keep on building

2966.75 --> 2974.06
on this plan you can't make it go away

2989.82 --> 2997.0800000000004
so yeah I don't know but look on the

2993.96 --> 3001.55
other hand it again could be over very

2997.08 --> 3007.15
quickly because even like think about

3001.55 --> 3011.1800000000003
this these crazy leftists sheep

3007.15 --> 3013.52
autocrats slaves however you will NPCs

3011.18 --> 3016.5099999999998
however you want to call it their status

3013.52 --> 3017.96
because they're cowards they know it and

3016.51 --> 3021.55
guess what

3017.96 --> 3022.67
as soon as the liberal machine is

3021.55 --> 3025.94
defeated

3022.67 --> 3027.62
like really structurally like yeah the

3025.94 --> 3029.87
leadership that kept everything the way

3027.62 --> 3032.98
it is and enforced the system

3029.87 --> 3037.24
cooperating with the rest of the parties

3032.98 --> 3042.14
they're taken a wave or arrested

3037.24 --> 3044.2599999999998
specific new rules whatever whatever if

3042.14 --> 3046.8199999999997
they're gone like all these minions

3044.26 --> 3048.4700000000003
they're gonna [ __ ] their pants and

3046.82 --> 3051.3500000000004
they're not gonna continue that [ __ ]

3048.47 --> 3053.95
they'll fall in line like goody

3051.35 --> 3057.65
two-shoes and they might have like

3053.95 --> 3060.23
desperate anxiety it [ __ ] you who knows

3057.65 --> 3061.9700000000003
maybe some of them will just flip so bad

3060.23 --> 3065.51
they'll just commit suicide I wouldn't

3061.97 --> 3067.6699999999996
put them put it past them the swath of

3065.51 --> 3069.6800000000003
these weirdos will do that in response

3067.67 --> 3070.79
to that but a lot of them will simply

3069.68 --> 3075.74
just like Oh

3070.79 --> 3080.24
the game is over no more being a freak

3075.74 --> 3081.77
I'll just act normal now there's a lot

3080.24 --> 3083.54
of people that are just gonna

3081.77 --> 3086.21
immediately fall in line because they

3083.54 --> 3088.55
are basically statist and they will only

3086.21 --> 3093.17
follow whatever is some kind of

3088.55 --> 3095.9500000000003
autocratic power they're not even really

3093.17 --> 3098.7400000000002
social justice words they're just

3095.95 --> 3103.2999999999997
sociopaths that just go with whatever

3098.74 --> 3103.2999999999997
suggests this power

3109.1 --> 3111.8199999999997
right

3122.47 --> 3125.04
yeah

3127.55 --> 3134.1400000000003
Thank You Uncle Bob yeah I am trying to

3132.17 --> 3136.2200000000003
basically tackle with the whole

3134.14 --> 3137.8399999999997
geopolitical situation and the

3136.22 --> 3142.9399999999996
ideologies and the crazies and

3137.84 --> 3147.08
corporatism the doublespeak culture said

3142.94 --> 3149.6
Satanism yeah all these things it is

3147.08 --> 3151.7599999999998
very big it's difficult to deal with and

3149.6 --> 3154.3399999999997
it's also very difficult to be honest

3151.76 --> 3161.0200000000004
about that is extremely difficult but

3154.34 --> 3163.9
most people will be grabbed by the

3161.02 --> 3166.67
finest of it and just start agitating

3163.9 --> 3170.39
out and they'll have little control

3166.67 --> 3173.0
little oversight yeah I've been pretty

3170.39 --> 3175.43
much in between these people before they

3173.0 --> 3178.39
were in the early stages before

3175.43 --> 3183.5499999999997
everything went completely insane but

3178.39 --> 3186.56
was already risky on the way just a

3183.55 --> 3192.1000000000004
liberalism extremism basically just

3186.56 --> 3195.59
mentally and because of this I

3192.1 --> 3198.7
understand how I've seen the different

3195.59 --> 3203.03
types I've seen that the the fools and

3198.7 --> 3205.46
in a way I was sort of a fool but also

3203.03 --> 3207.8300000000004
sort of a spy at the same time so I was

3205.46 --> 3210.95
acting like a fool was letting things

3207.83 --> 3214.22
overcome me like a fool but very well

3210.95 --> 3217.0099999999998
guarded not to end up basically dead

3214.22 --> 3219.1099999999997
somewhere because I was them aware that

3217.01 --> 3222.86
it was getting dangerous eventually and

3219.11 --> 3226.01
that it yeah but I know the types I know

3222.86 --> 3229.3700000000003
the fools that go with it I know just

3226.01 --> 3231.86
the the short-sighted greedy idiots

3229.37 --> 3233.6
they'll just let you yeah the sociopaths

3231.86 --> 3237.26
that alechem to anything and no very

3233.6 --> 3241.63
little shame and the people that are

3237.26 --> 3245.51
just really reversed world maniacs and

3241.63 --> 3248.84
that absolutely break their suspense of

3245.51 --> 3254.3900000000003
disbelief with the way of doing that and

3248.84 --> 3256.58
make it the reality to them so sometimes

3254.39 --> 3259.65
aggressively so they would if you would

3256.58 --> 3261.27
touch that they would like get violent

3259.65 --> 3264.69
if you touch that mentally if you

3261.27 --> 3266.64
doubted it for example yeah so there's

3264.69 --> 3269.93
all these degrees I guess the last

3266.64 --> 3275.0
degree was basically a Satanist

3269.93 --> 3275.0
yeah and I've dealt with those as well

3277.28 --> 3282.4100000000003
and they're all in there

3290.79 --> 3302.82
it's yeah it's really like it you know

3296.06 --> 3306.59
in a way weirdly enough the the liberal

3302.82 --> 3312.2400000000002
political machine is like a crazy

3306.59 --> 3316.92
oversized corporation a world dominating

3312.24 --> 3319.35
corporation based on politics and they

3316.92 --> 3322.23
have all these groups that have all

3319.35 --> 3325.47
invested interest in that all basically

3322.23 --> 3329.01
even enemies among one another just a

3325.47 --> 3331.52
giant pile of people kind of foolishly

3329.01 --> 3334.8900000000003
going along with it entire groups or

3331.52 --> 3337.47
traditionalists that still go on the old

3334.89 --> 3340.8599999999997
compass doesn't really work anymore but

3337.47 --> 3344.22
they still do and all that pile together

3340.86 --> 3346.6800000000003
is basically without some of them even

3344.22 --> 3348.75
fully realizing it or they're just like

3346.68 --> 3349.9199999999996
blocking that realization from sinking

3348.75 --> 3351.93
in because they don't know what to do

3349.92 --> 3357.15
about it all of that is basically trying

3351.93 --> 3359.1299999999997
to destroy the order and not just the

3357.15 --> 3363.2000000000003
control mechanism but literally the

3359.13 --> 3366.54
order in the world the human order of

3363.2 --> 3368.8199999999997
natural dealing things of balanced

3366.54 --> 3372.57
traditions they're destroying it that

3368.82 --> 3375.27
machine like a political corporation is

3372.57 --> 3379.23
basically trying to destroy the world to

3375.27 --> 3382.86
gain more grip to gain more financial

3379.23 --> 3384.72
imperial control all of it together and

3382.86 --> 3388.1400000000003
there's bankers in there there's

3384.72 --> 3392.31
religious groups in there giant amount

3388.14 --> 3395.5699999999997
of mega corporations there's there's

3392.31 --> 3395.57
royalty in there

3400.4 --> 3407.21
so it is basically a giant mega

3402.559 --> 3411.289
corporation with huge amount of

3407.21 --> 3413.7490000000003
investors and a political system that is

3411.289 --> 3416.15
basically the acting arm the rest is

3413.749 --> 3418.64
just doing business support but the

3416.15 --> 3422.359
political system is the acting arm to

3418.64 --> 3425.029
basically destabilize countries and take

3422.359 --> 3427.7889999999998
it over get more corporate grip and

3425.029 --> 3430.63
eventually just yeah shamelessly start

3427.789 --> 3434.21
to destroy everything to take it over

3430.63 --> 3435.88
that is how it works so yeah I'm gonna

3434.21 --> 3438.109
