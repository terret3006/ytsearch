6.78 --> 40.95
[Music]

36.98 --> 44.4
good morning welcome to flatter the

40.95 --> 48.809000000000005
earlybird number 119 I'm your host

44.4 --> 53.239
Arwen yeah today I'm gonna be audible

48.809 --> 56.699
again because yeah yesterday was a wreck

53.239 --> 61.559
in retrospect because yeah I had my new

56.699 --> 65.58
microphone I am back to the 5 euro

61.559 --> 68.25
microphone and yeah with the headphones

65.58 --> 70.86
in that sounded really perfect and then

68.25 --> 74.67
I listened to the stream afterward and

70.86 --> 77.34
it was total [ __ ] so yeah that

74.67 --> 79.38
microphone was obviously broken I also

77.34 --> 82.59
tested it out with some several other

79.38 --> 85.67999999999999
programs like Skype and it yielded the

82.59 --> 89.55
same result so I had to return it right

85.68 --> 92.24000000000001
away it was a total bummer so back to

89.55 --> 97.2
the shitty irony and sound for now

92.24 --> 100.19999999999999
although I will do my best to get to

97.2 --> 102.03
redo that and hopefully this time I'll

100.2 --> 105.42
get a working one that doesn't have

102.03 --> 107.909
these problems so yeah talking about

105.42 --> 113.13
things getting screwed up sorry for

107.909 --> 116.13000000000001
being late I was up way too late this

113.13 --> 119.82
night yeah or should I say this morning

116.13 --> 122.52
and I had a stern talking to myself like

119.82 --> 125.80999999999999
Arwen what are you doing you idiot don't

122.52 --> 129.509
go this idiotic you late to bed you fool

125.81 --> 130.79
don't screw yourself over stop it don't

129.509 --> 140.30999999999997
do that again

130.79 --> 143.85
like that so yeah then right be five

140.31 --> 147.57
minutes before I want to start there's

143.85 --> 152.28
this process where I basically have a

147.57 --> 155.519
constant livestream option going in the

152.28 --> 157.48
dashboard and then to create a back

155.519 --> 161.83
panel I have to make

157.48 --> 163.09
separate new hangout to do that yes do

161.83 --> 164.769
that through life board because

163.09 --> 168.849
everything is so straightforward and

164.769 --> 171.31
clear and logical google not but I did

168.849 --> 173.26
that and then yeah you delete that

171.31 --> 176.08
otherwise there's gonna be two life

173.26 --> 178.569
events at the same time and I

176.08 --> 181.09
accidentally deleted the live dashboards

178.569 --> 184.86999999999998
and with that all the hashtags in there

181.09 --> 186.70000000000002
and the stream key and so it became a

184.87 --> 187.329
giant mess and that's why I'm 20 minutes

186.7 --> 192.14999999999998
late

187.329 --> 196.68
sorry about that I actually even come to

192.15 --> 196.68
making my mom breakfast

201.92 --> 207.069
so yeah it's a bit messy

209.69 --> 216.74
as for D whether it's been raining all

212.87 --> 228.08
nights pretty much not hard and now it's

216.74 --> 230.95000000000002
just great and windy all the time it's

228.08 --> 230.95000000000002
not very nice

238.849 --> 241.689
oh well

246.81 --> 249.38
yeah

249.86 --> 259.85
it is so yeah glad to see you guys hang

255.5 --> 273.04
hung around despite me being late again

259.85 --> 273.04
I guess so let's see who's in chat

279.65 --> 288.12
so CAS McLeod aigrette Wells Jesse

285.15 --> 290.87899999999996
Wilson senior Julie Bennett lofty says

288.12 --> 296.52
Michael Roark Nathan Oakley over moco

290.879 --> 300.16900000000004
red eye Jedi 420 UK Shane Walter and

296.52 --> 303.529
Steve that's what the participants say

300.169 --> 303.529
so far

306.159 --> 309.959
that seems to be correct

310.159 --> 318.62
withdraw

312.69 --> 318.62
yeah yeah good to see you guys

320.789 --> 323.719
it's weird

324.76 --> 330.76
like yeah but now you know do my thing

327.64 --> 334.51
on my landlord check my window actually

330.76 --> 337.65
send me a complimentary text message

334.51 --> 342.64
that I should be your window maker okay

337.65 --> 344.73999999999995
right so that was unexpected or Wow like

342.64 --> 346.15
I knew I didn't did a good job but

344.74 --> 348.22
didn't expect him to get all

346.15 --> 351.09999999999997
complimentary and everything he rarely

348.22 --> 353.68
does that so must have been very

351.1 --> 355.48
impressed in how little money this is

353.68 --> 364.21
gonna cost him because that's probably

355.48 --> 367.3
what really impresses him the most yeah

364.21 --> 369.15999999999997
what by the way thank you Nathan Oakley

367.3 --> 371.29
for the two-pound super chair donation

369.16 --> 375.87
much appreciated and thanks again for

371.29 --> 375.87
all the help saving my show

381.51 --> 386.27
I lost track of what I was going to say

393.38 --> 396.21999999999997
I don't know

408.99 --> 414.12
lots of stuff happening I noticed

411.36 --> 416.66900000000004
something weird and the elección show

414.12 --> 421.53000000000003
that they now have this weird background

416.669 --> 426.479
thingy going on it's like very creative

421.53 --> 430.10999999999996
3d not the usual typical Earth Map stuff

426.479 --> 433.289
and all that but yeah they because they

430.11 --> 435.47900000000004
do have like the spinning disk but not

433.289 --> 437.46
the disk the spinning ring earth usually

435.479 --> 439.56
that's the background or the globe or

437.46 --> 442.13
the milk even layer globe or whatever

439.56 --> 446.76
thing you now they doing like this weird

442.13 --> 448.59
almost a sure like interactive 3d

446.76 --> 451.169
background thingy it's kind of

448.59 --> 453.419
interesting very artistic but it's weird

451.169 --> 455.63
it's like out of nowhere they started

453.419 --> 461.28
doing this now I think for two days I

455.63 --> 463.949
was I don't know I don't know they're

461.28 --> 467.88
doing stuff don't know why they do that

463.949 --> 469.74
I have to be fair I haven't paid a lot

467.88 --> 472.11
of attention recently just to

469.74 --> 476.51
preoccupied with my own things oh yeah

472.11 --> 480.599
now I know what I wanted to say yeah

476.51 --> 483.389
this is kind of odd and like seriously

480.599 --> 489.479
who really cares but it feels like I've

483.389 --> 491.42
gone underwent a maybe a metabolic

489.479 --> 495.65
change or something

491.42 --> 499.61
because everything works differently now

495.65 --> 504.62
again it's weird it's weird to realize

499.61 --> 506.63
that that suddenly I respond completely

504.62 --> 508.52
different to cannabis I don't know where

506.63 --> 511.49
I don't get panic attacks all of a

508.52 --> 516.8
sudden from it I actually get the

511.49 --> 519.3100000000001
original sensation of - and that

516.8 --> 522.53
actually even encourages me to like

519.31 --> 525.8299999999999
smoke and hey-o bigger that's so weird

522.53 --> 528.53
because like a week ago I wouldn't even

525.83 --> 532.3100000000001
dare doing that because every time it's

528.53 --> 535.4599999999999
like okay can I take this because it has

532.31 --> 540.7099999999999
it also negative influences on me and it

535.46 --> 542.39
just still do it because yeah there are

540.71 --> 544.61
some side effects that I kind of like

542.39 --> 548.21
gives me like a little bit of extra

544.61 --> 550.4
clarity despite the weird feelings yeah

548.21 --> 553.25
the more paranoid sensations you could

550.4 --> 555.98
say but suddenly I think since yesterday

553.25 --> 559.67
or something maybe today I'm really

555.98 --> 564.5500000000001
noticing it's like completely completely

559.67 --> 567.4399999999999
different it feels like my metabolism

564.55 --> 572.75
it's just completely different all of a

567.44 --> 575.84
sudden and the way my man my mind aligns

572.75 --> 579.04
to my body just feels different it is so

575.84 --> 582.73
weird to to realize this

579.04 --> 585.13
maybe it's because I haven't drank how

582.73 --> 588.1
any alcohol in two days and it certainly

585.13 --> 592.15
did like this transition but it's feel

588.1 --> 596.5
different it's so weird being this being

592.15 --> 600.5799999999999
me feel different very very different

596.5 --> 606.13
and yeah I certainly respond differently

600.58 --> 608.5
to food and smoking things and now I got

606.13 --> 611.65
this weird urge again to stay up late

608.5 --> 614.44
and terrible can't allow myself to do

611.65 --> 618.9399999999999
that can't allow it because it always

614.44 --> 621.6300000000001
returns up in me kind of breaking myself

618.94 --> 625.1500000000001
my energy can't allow that to happen

621.63 --> 629.59
like seriously need some discipline to

625.15 --> 633.37
prevent that from happening on the other

629.59 --> 638.49
hand it's such a relief suck your relief

633.37 --> 640.72
to be out of this weird slow burning

638.49 --> 644.41
building down sort of depression

640.72 --> 648.34
depression cycle thingy maybe it is

644.41 --> 653.4399999999999
because I have been able to do so many

648.34 --> 656.6800000000001
things in sequence without any prolonged

653.44 --> 658.9000000000001
period of like a vacuum around me where

656.68 --> 662.65
there's just seems to be nothing and I

658.9 --> 665.35
could do maybe that triggered it I don't

662.65 --> 669.3299999999999
know but I feel completely different

665.35 --> 669.33
it's so day and night it's just

670.7 --> 673.5400000000001
it's just weird

675.64 --> 682.36
also yeah I have been taking a lot of

679.24 --> 684.94
fish oil I have I have it so that might

682.36 --> 687.49
have been a contributor to basically a

684.94 --> 690.4300000000001
transition where my metabolic system

687.49 --> 693.37
suddenly switched around and I'm in

690.43 --> 696.76
another mode I don't know what it is but

693.37 --> 700.84
it's really weird to feel so differently

696.76 --> 703.51
and to really notice like a realignment

700.84 --> 707.38
it's like the connections of how things

703.51 --> 710.83
flow how I personally perceive with the

707.38 --> 714.73
sensory input it just seems like it's in

710.83 --> 716.6500000000001
another structure it's just in another

714.73 --> 718.57
structure I can't explain in any other

716.65 --> 721.17
way and yeah I need to stop talking

718.57 --> 723.0100000000001
about this it's not that interesting

721.17 --> 726.9699999999999
it's just weird

723.01 --> 729.97
feel good very different about this part

726.97 --> 731.89
yeah the the focus the conscious that's

729.97 --> 734.77
still the same it's just everything else

731.89 --> 742.41
that surrounds it just seems kind of

734.77 --> 742.41
different weird anyway

749.67 --> 757.61
biers bad ya gotta be careful with that

755.19 --> 757.61
stuff

758.22 --> 764.73
it's so strange how you can just keep on

761.86 --> 767.5600000000001
drinking and just like kind of works

764.73 --> 770.08
though there is kind of the back setting

767.56 --> 773.9499999999999
the backlash warning and everything and

770.08 --> 776.4100000000001
then yeah you reconstitute and you go

773.95 --> 780.6700000000001
again and yeah the cycle continues it

776.41 --> 785.38
kind of works until suddenly it doesn't

780.67 --> 788.88
really work anymore and then things

785.38 --> 795.73
happen like the the last gaming night

788.88 --> 802.3
where I did drink and then suddenly it

795.73 --> 805.57
didn't deliver in in the right way and

802.3 --> 808.9499999999999
make me actually more vulnerable in it's

805.57 --> 813.49
very odd how that works but yeah these

808.95 --> 817.33
drugs and alcohol and it just changes

813.49 --> 823.45
you but the way it changes you I guess

817.33 --> 826.45
depends on the cycle of your own being

823.45 --> 828.5790000000001
your meta metabolic cosig chol where you

826.45 --> 831.76
are at the moment maybe even the

828.579 --> 834.31
seasonal thing it may it matters I don't

831.76 --> 837.27
know how it exactly works but it has an

834.31 --> 837.27
influence it's weird

839.089 --> 850.2900000000001
yeah so yeah and I'm gonna try to stay

846.66 --> 852.66
clear a little of the alcohol though I

850.29 --> 856.4699999999999
do have fond memories because it was

852.66 --> 858.959
really cool in a way but yeah I'm not

856.47 --> 861.3290000000001
gonna do that for a while and just stick

858.959 --> 863.43
to cannabis again because it seems to

861.329 --> 866.579
now so did not create panic anymore

863.43 --> 870.5999999999999
which is freaking awesome and dangerous

866.579 --> 872.699
because now it's like oh yeah gotta be

870.6 --> 874.74
careful not to spend all my money on

872.699 --> 880.5889999999999
that [ __ ] again I don't want it I been

874.74 --> 883.259
very very tidy like yeah spending very

880.589 --> 886.6800000000001
little and I liked that that was like

883.259 --> 888.149
the one big advantage of being over

886.68 --> 890.3389999999999
sensitive to it is that I don't

888.149 --> 895.499
overspend on it and that was good and I

890.339 --> 898.2790000000001
want to keep that out I don't even know

895.499 --> 898.279
who the hell that is

899.5 --> 906.06
all right I've heard well yeah yeah we

903.16 --> 910.9499999999999
can meet up tomorrow that will be great

906.06 --> 910.9499999999999
sure can do that

917.71 --> 920.82
I don't know how

924.0 --> 933.51
always why do regular people always get

929.41 --> 933.51
so trolley in my

935.32 --> 941.59
in my chat find it really annoying and

938.53 --> 945.75
they do that I'm talking serious [ __ ]

941.59 --> 945.75
here I do not know Momo

964.41 --> 972.63
don't trust the weather for going by

966.45 --> 976.0500000000001
bike ride Hagrid yeah well hey cherry

972.63 --> 988.8
windy and yeah right now it's raining

976.05 --> 989.9599999999999
too by the way it kind of sucks yeah by

988.8 --> 995.0999999999999
the way

989.96 --> 999.0600000000001
concerning the microphone again bring

995.1 --> 1003.76
that back yeah

999.06 --> 1003.76
look since this [ __ ] didn't work out

1008.36 --> 1017.2090000000001
No stop asking me stupid draw questions

1014.019 --> 1019.939
just [ __ ] off with the troll questions

1017.209 --> 1022.819
if you want to know intricate dark world

1019.939 --> 1024.549
shitty details okay things that I'm not

1022.819 --> 1028.309
supposed to talk about or whatever

1024.549 --> 1031.039
contact me on skype and talk to me there

1028.309 --> 1035.6589999999999
stop being a freaking troll and just

1031.039 --> 1038.089
throw in superficial weird [ __ ] expected

1035.659 --> 1042.8190000000002
me to respond to that I'm not gonna do

1038.089 --> 1049.1589999999999
that okay

1042.819 --> 1053.059
I'm not a freaking puppet cut it out

1049.159 --> 1057.47
anyway what I wanted to talk about is

1053.059 --> 1060.44
the mic thing yeah I was yeah I could

1057.47 --> 1067.039
act it was weird because it seems all

1060.44 --> 1070.039
perfectly nice that yeah I was able to

1067.039 --> 1072.74
get that mic at a fantastic price and

1070.039 --> 1075.049
could be completely covered by my PayPal

1072.74 --> 1078.919
donation so far there's the problem

1075.049 --> 1082.25
since that specific one didn't work yeah

1078.919 --> 1088.3600000000001
there is no more mic no more new mic in

1082.25 --> 1092.299
price range so I was scared to ask but

1088.36 --> 1096.86
please donate to my PayPal I could

1092.299 --> 1101.21
really like use it's terrible but up to

1096.86 --> 1103.6999999999998
like 50 bucks and then I would be able

1101.21 --> 1107.21
to just not buy a second hand but a new

1103.7 --> 1110.8600000000001
one which make me guarantee then it'll

1107.21 --> 1110.8600000000001
actually work a lot better

1223.57 --> 1229.1789999999999
can't get to those yet because I still

1226.36 --> 1232.119
have to get standard advertisement money

1229.179 --> 1236.909
up to 70 euros or otherwise you can have

1232.119 --> 1239.35
yeah I got like $250 worth of pay off

1236.909 --> 1243.6390000000001

1239.35 --> 1246.9699999999998
those they're like oh no no no no no

1243.639 --> 1250.119
we're gonna use that for our banking

1246.97 --> 1252.34
scam [ __ ] and to act like we have more

1250.119 --> 1254.7389999999998
money than we really have even though

1252.34 --> 1256.09
it's really yours because you can't get

1254.739 --> 1258.519
to it because it's gonna take like

1256.09 --> 1261.129
months or what effort to get there and

1258.519 --> 1263.98
until that time we're gonna financially

1261.129 --> 1266.769
abuse it for our financial scams or

1263.98 --> 1270.669
banking [ __ ] that's what they always do

1266.769 --> 1273.129
now that's what bankers do they make you

1270.669 --> 1274.1190000000001
think like you have something but you

1273.129 --> 1276.759
can't reach it

1274.119 --> 1278.9189999999999
so they can actually a bhoot abuse it

1276.759 --> 1281.95
for their freakin financial scams and

1278.919 --> 1287.2
[ __ ] and interest and they make millions

1281.95 --> 1289.779
of it and yeah you're just gonna have to

1287.2 --> 1291.669
sit there like oh yeah I'm like I might

1289.779 --> 1296.47
dedicate it and make it finally gonna

1291.669 --> 1298.269
get it mr. banker my boss am I gonna get

1315.369 --> 1320.4599999999998
gonna do what I say

1316.299 --> 1324.539
cuz yeah no bank no food you know

1320.46 --> 1326.7

1324.539 --> 1328.86
YouTube's kind of doing that [ __ ] with

1326.7 --> 1331.8600000000001
the super chat as well that's how it

1328.86 --> 1334.11
feels to me like oh yeah you you've got

1331.86 --> 1336.539
a lot of money but yeah you can't have

1334.11 --> 1337.619
it it's not yours yet you could go to

1377.32 --> 1382.72
necessarily need to don't have specific

1380.02 --> 1384.97
material to talk about but I can because

1382.72 --> 1386.59
there's no flatter debate life of course

1384.97 --> 1387.64
because it's Saturday and neither will

1386.59 --> 1390.06
there be tomorrow

1387.64 --> 1393.76
although Nathan might do like a late

1390.06 --> 1397.75
debate you did last time but yeah the

1393.76 --> 1400.78
show can go on for more than 20 minutes

1397.75 --> 1404.59

1400.78 --> 1409.17
panel even ballers maybe not Jose cuz

1404.59 --> 1409.1699999999998
I'm kind of done with that [ __ ]

1413.35 --> 1419.1999999999998
because it's just being a troll

1416.47 --> 1425.68
but anyone wanted wanting to talk about

1419.2 --> 1430.3
anything anything don't be a keyboard

1425.68 --> 1436.1100000000001
warrior and talk to me on it on my panel

1430.3 --> 1436.11
on my show with your voice let's talk

1453.14 --> 1461.65
all right get in here Shane Walter yeah

1457.4 --> 1461.65
if you want to go get on absolutely

1508.56 --> 1514.3799999999999
okay yeah getting distracted here

1511.91 --> 1518.3400000000001
Eckhart was just point me to another

1514.38 --> 1520.7600000000002
type of camera I camera microphone I

1518.34 --> 1520.76
don't know

1521.33 --> 1530.31
it does have some convenience stuff in

1524.58 --> 1533.82
there so it does look kind of good but I

1530.31 --> 1536.85
would prefer to go for the Yeti because

1533.82 --> 1538.76
that thing is really good if it's not

1536.85 --> 1543.87
broken that's the whole point and

1538.76 --> 1546.09
there's like accessories available for

1543.87 --> 1549.35
that specific mic as well which will

1546.09 --> 1553.77
cost more so it might take some time

1549.35 --> 1556.98
which are very good like that thing

1553.77 --> 1559.59
looks really professional it looks

1556.98 --> 1562.6200000000001
professional it probably is but yeah you

1559.59 --> 1566.49
can have like the desktop microphone it

1562.62 --> 1570.9899999999998
works and then later on I could get like

1566.49 --> 1573.51
it a flexible arm actually to just put

1570.99 --> 1576.63
it on my desk or even attach it to my

1573.51 --> 1579.69
central heating system so I can just

1576.63 --> 1582.24
point move it right in front of my face

1579.69 --> 1586.8600000000001
and wink move it away oh that would be

1582.24 --> 1589.02
so great I'd have that but that's gonna

1586.86 --> 1592.74
take some time and I'll get there

1589.02 --> 1595.74
alright I will get there like my whole

1592.74 --> 1599.64
financial backup plan system as I call

1595.74 --> 1603.21
it the GTI I'm getting there as well I'm

1599.64 --> 1608.24
getting credit card payment capability

1603.21 --> 1610.69
with that system and it's coming soon

1608.24 --> 1614.06
and yeah of course I'm gonna use that to

1610.69 --> 1615.98
get a ticket to the Amsterdam Flat Earth

1614.06 --> 1621.7
conference this year and that in

1615.98 --> 1623.81
September about also yeah other stuff

1621.7 --> 1625.52
it's gonna be great

1623.81 --> 1633.79
because I'm not just gonna be purely

1625.52 --> 1633.79
dependent them money in the bank yeah

1638.25 --> 1644.96
yeah we'll be cool to see you I got

1640.559 --> 1644.96
wells tomorrow

1676.059 --> 1685.3899999999999
ranty psychics warrior if any Lancer see

1686.08 --> 1700.52

1998.77 --> 2003.69
question and you see the world in five

2001.17 --> 2006.9
years with all this flat earth vs. globe

2003.69 --> 2013.6200000000001
carrying on I see it all carrying on as

2006.9 --> 2017.91
it does what with a lot of hassle going

2013.62 --> 2021.9299999999998
on and not just flat earth like Flat

2017.91 --> 2024.5400000000002
Earth is gonna be pretty much on the

2021.93 --> 2027.8100000000002
background from all the hassle and noise

2024.54 --> 2030.51
being created surrounding it like with

2027.81 --> 2034.23
the yellow fast movement with the

2030.51 --> 2036.23
freakin subterfuge wars going on all the

2034.23 --> 2041.91
parties suddenly making their moves

2036.23 --> 2047.97
banks being tested sacred cows being

2041.91 --> 2050.429
slaughtered like culturally seriously

2047.97 --> 2052.98
guys I don't know if you noticed but

2050.429 --> 2055.35
like flat earth versus the globe even

2052.98 --> 2058.26
though we have giant momentum it's gonna

2055.35 --> 2063.54
be on the background everything else

2058.26 --> 2066.8300000000004
that's going on and it are you continue

2063.54 --> 2070.2599999999998
how are you doing hey home to the house

2066.83 --> 2073.5299999999997
how's it going man okay we talking about

2070.26 --> 2076.7400000000002
microphones before yeah at a microphone

2073.53 --> 2080.73
shitty situation yes what do you what do

2076.74 --> 2087.6
you use now did the cheapest microphone

2080.73 --> 2093.89
ever produce like a USB mic no it's

2087.6 --> 2098.22
literally a plug-in thingy super basic

2093.89 --> 2101.48
all right it works you know five euros I

2098.22 --> 2105.5499999999997
have nothing to complain except for this

2101.48 --> 2109.58
but yeah it's been working for years so

2105.55 --> 2111.38
for five years I can make that but yeah

2109.58 --> 2113.69
I tried it a new one that's much better

2111.38 --> 2115.31
and then it turned out to be freakin

2113.69 --> 2122.26
broken hey Randy

2115.31 --> 2122.2599999999998
oh don't forget to mute your watch [ __ ]

2124.3 --> 2130.6090000000004
Randy you know what I would suggest get

2127.34 --> 2131.69
get the snowball microphone by blue it's

2130.609 --> 2135.77
that one that's like it looks like a

2131.69 --> 2139.67
globe I know I know not bad I know it

2135.77 --> 2140.99
well I got the Yeti it's better but you

2139.67 --> 2144.38
know it happened to be broken

2140.99 --> 2145.609
so that's oh yeah that sucked what was

2144.38 --> 2149.75
wrong with it

2145.609 --> 2150.95
it had random it like there was this

2149.75 --> 2155.83
system in it I think

2150.95 --> 2157.7
- basically adapt the noise level was

2155.83 --> 2159.619
completely contained within the

2157.7 --> 2160.0699999999997
microphone itself no regulation or

2159.619 --> 2162.3500000000004
anything

2160.07 --> 2165.8900000000003
so like an auto-adjust but it failed

2162.35 --> 2169.16
miserably so just randomly fluctuated in

2165.89 --> 2171.5
and out of the a loudness and that

2169.16 --> 2174.44
happened my hangout yesterday all day

2171.5 --> 2176.359
like just listen back it was so terrible

2174.44 --> 2179.21
sometimes you can barely hear we doesn't

2176.359 --> 2183.0499999999997
like very loud and then back to nothing

2179.21 --> 2184.76
it was total [ __ ] and it happened the

2183.05 --> 2186.619
same thing happened when i Skype called

2184.76 --> 2189.1400000000003
with that microphone and another guy to

2186.619 --> 2191.48
test it did the same thing so it was

2189.14 --> 2193.46
just [ __ ] up hey yeah that's that you

2191.48 --> 2196.22
had one like this right right but a

2193.46 --> 2198.17
black version okay on the back these are

2196.22 --> 2200.9599999999996
your polar pattern I know I took write

2198.17 --> 2202.4900000000002
it all out I'd worked it all out game

2200.96 --> 2204.619
you don't even have to mess with find

2202.49 --> 2209.5699999999997
out volume I didn't mess with I don't

2204.619 --> 2213.5
even use the volume out I just plug it

2209.57 --> 2215.96
in USB and only use cardioid which would

2213.5 --> 2219.23
be the one that the heart shaped I did

2215.96 --> 2221.93
that I did all of that extensive

2219.23 --> 2223.94
extensive extensive testing double

2221.93 --> 2225.6499999999996
testing double checking checking all my

2223.94 --> 2228.77
settings checking all my control panel

2225.65 --> 2230.56
sound settings everything it was broken

2228.77 --> 2233.68
it was simply for

2230.56 --> 2235.21
welcome what did you buy it from hmm

2233.68 --> 2238.54
where'd you buy it from

2235.21 --> 2242.89
it was secondhand through a major

2238.54 --> 2244.54
through a major yeah Megastore online

2242.89 --> 2247.99
company here in the Netherlands which is

2244.54 --> 2249.88
reputable a very good but yeah it was

2247.99 --> 2251.95
like extra cheap because it was

2249.88 --> 2255.31
secondhand they said okay it's just been

2251.95 --> 2257.71
out of the package tried once this one's

2255.31 --> 2260.92
the old model as like this little label

2257.71 --> 2263.68
on it one I have in my garage is like is

2260.92 --> 2267.01
the newer model it's not a bad it you

2263.68 --> 2269.5299999999997
know it'll record this drumset really

2267.01 --> 2271.69
well and that's just by way of the size

2269.53 --> 2273.25
of the capsule it can actually handle

2271.69 --> 2275.7400000000002
the kick drum that can handle all these

2273.25 --> 2278.44
drums and different fluctuations and

2275.74 --> 2283.33
volume but it sounds to me like yeah

2278.44 --> 2286.81
that sucks like right now you know get

2283.33 --> 2288.88
in one of these which is like gah it's

2286.81 --> 2294.96
just basically like an interface I'm not

2288.88 --> 2294.96
gonna happen you get one of these oh man

2295.02 --> 2302.2
mixer

2296.29 --> 2304.06
I mean basically if you're if you're if

2302.2 --> 2306.27
your microphone has if you had one of

2304.06 --> 2309.13
these cables you're in the world of

2306.27 --> 2311.68
you're in professional land I know I

2309.13 --> 2315.9300000000003
know my mother worked with those I don't

2311.68 --> 2320.1299999999997
have any of it and I probably never will

2315.93 --> 2323.94
doesn't know freaking rich

2320.13 --> 2326.6400000000003
not anymore anyway well I mean you've

2323.94 --> 2329.039
been doing enough podcasting to warrant

2326.64 --> 2331.3799999999997
good microphone not that you sound bad

2329.039 --> 2334.7090000000003
right now sense sounds fine to me I'm

2331.38 --> 2338.5190000000002
just for 5 euros I think that sounds

2334.709 --> 2340.2889999999998
pretty damn well this microphone is the

2338.519 --> 2343.3799999999997
UH this is like if you look up

2340.289 --> 2349.2290000000003
microphone in the dictionary this is the

2343.38 --> 2352.0190000000002
one the sm58 it's like the one you can

2349.229 --> 2353.43
when you have good monitoring you can

2352.019 --> 2357.779
listen to your voice and you can talk

2353.43 --> 2362.009
like mm-hmm you know Howard Stern or

2357.779 --> 2368.579
really listen to your own gravel so

2362.009 --> 2371.299
anyway what's new any discoveries any

2368.579 --> 2371.299
revelations

2372.16 --> 2380.2
I've discoveries any revelations okay

2377.02 --> 2382.18
yeah Wow glow Buster's I heard that Bob

2380.2 --> 2384.5499999999997
didn't actually delete all the videos

2382.18 --> 2387.3399999999997
but just set them to private because of

2384.55 --> 2389.73
copyright issue so that's that I guess

2387.34 --> 2389.73
it's good

2390.19 --> 2398.56
oh when Benjamin made an epic remark

2397.15 --> 2400.75
yesterday on his show

2398.56 --> 2407.29
concerning Jews which I thought was

2400.75 --> 2409.15
really really funny I'll quote it you

2407.29 --> 2411.07
did something funny he did I am he does

2409.15 --> 2415.81
funny [ __ ] all the time

2411.07 --> 2418.2400000000002
did you see Jimmy Fallon video yep the

2415.81 --> 2420.66
styling one yeah that was epic that was

2418.24 --> 2424.66
good I like that side of Owen Benjamin

2420.66 --> 2428.47
yep I think his position is healthy it's

2424.66 --> 2430.81
good that he's not he shouldn't once he

2428.47 --> 2432.8799999999997
goes flat which I'm sure he's smart

2430.81 --> 2435.16
enough to know either never gonna happen

2432.88 --> 2437.11
it's better that he stays within the

2435.16 --> 2439.0899999999997
confines of the entropies the

2437.11 --> 2439.3900000000003
intermediate you know stays right in the

2439.09 --> 2442.36
middle

2439.39 --> 2447.91
mm-hm that way no one can tag him he

2442.36 --> 2450.03
doesn't as like a flat hard right now

2447.91 --> 2453.04
he's on the front line of comedy

2450.03 --> 2454.9900000000002
that's literally what that is like Alex

2453.04 --> 2458.59
Jones tries to be on the front line of

2454.99 --> 2461.6699999999996
alternative media and kind of sort of

2458.59 --> 2464.6200000000003
becoming the new level of mainstream

2461.67 --> 2467.8
because the the the main mainstream has

2464.62 --> 2469.93
become a corrupted clown show literally

2467.8 --> 2473.11
and everyone in the freaking world knows

2469.93 --> 2476.08
it everyone in the world knows it

2473.11 --> 2478.75
so he's becoming the new mainstream the

2476.08 --> 2481.24
sub the new sub mainstream mainstream

2478.75 --> 2484.06
and Owen Benjamin is trying to become

2481.24 --> 2486.3999999999996
the new tip of the spear when it comes

2484.06 --> 2488.89
to comedy and he's putting it all in

2486.4 --> 2492.31
he's literally risking his life to do it

2488.89 --> 2494.83
and it's awesome and he's finding his

2492.31 --> 2497.0499999999997
way through it's really impressive but

2494.83 --> 2499.63
yeah I wanted to quote this joke of him

2497.05 --> 2502.69
though I was really happy

2499.63 --> 2506.1400000000003
so he was talking about yeah the typical

2502.69 --> 2509.559
wine enos of certain Jew stereotypes

2506.14 --> 2512.95
which are present in there and I'd like

2509.559 --> 2517.239
to personally emphasize like yeah that's

2512.95 --> 2520.479
in there and the Jews themselves find it

2517.239 --> 2522.7
kind of funny so don't [ __ ] your pants

2520.479 --> 2524.5589999999997
every time like some weird Jew

2522.7 --> 2526.66
characteristic is being described

2524.559 --> 2529.42
because they themselves think it's

2526.66 --> 2531.5789999999997
freakin funny and that's just true so

2529.42 --> 2534.9700000000003
what he said is like yeah

2531.579 --> 2538.6600000000003
the Jews still to this day complain

2534.97 --> 2540.97
about Egypt okay right that's thousands

2538.66 --> 2544.3289999999997
of years ago they still now whine to

2540.97 --> 2547.5389999999998
everyone about freaking Egypt so yeah

2544.329 --> 2549.69
thanks a lot Hitler thanks for giving

2547.539 --> 2561.099
them yet another thing to complain about

2549.69 --> 2563.279
forever it's that's comedic genius I

2561.099 --> 2567.5190000000002
loved it

2563.279 --> 2571.119
yeah Jews that you have us have a knack

2567.519 --> 2572.9199999999996
for making their whining stand out

2571.119 --> 2576.759
amongst all the other whiners in the

2572.92 --> 2578.289
world they invented trolling that's true

2576.759 --> 2579.88
you know there's a lesson to be learned

2578.289 --> 2583.059
with what you were talking about just

2579.88 --> 2585.63
like a minute ago about Alex Jones

2583.059 --> 2589.0890000000004
becoming you know alternate media

2585.63 --> 2591.009
alternative media and Benjamin it's like

2589.089 --> 2594.0389999999998
when you turn your back on the narrative

2591.009 --> 2596.799
and do something else that people are

2594.039 --> 2599.289
into wave goodbye to the old narrative

2596.799 --> 2601.569
it's like we don't have to fight it we

2599.289 --> 2603.3390000000004
don't have to fight the vay we just turn

2601.569 --> 2606.94
our backs on them and they literally

2603.339 --> 2609.13
wither away we don't feed them we don't

2606.94 --> 2612.309
give them our attention and they'll come

2609.13 --> 2616.089
running to us and beg for our attention

2612.309 --> 2617.9790000000003
and that's kind of like you know I think

2616.089 --> 2621.339
there's a lot of that flat earth there's

2617.979 --> 2624.8489999999997
a lot of things and one thing I don't

2621.339 --> 2626.92
think anyone could contest is that it at

2624.849 --> 2628.25
least gets the people who wanted to bunk

2626.92 --> 2630.89
it

2628.25 --> 2633.5
possibly doing a little bit of research

2630.89 --> 2636.41
right yes it does everyone to think a

2633.5 --> 2638.69
little bit right there there is a unique

2636.41 --> 2640.3689999999997
thing about the whole setup of what's

2638.69 --> 2642.32
going on with Flat Earth with

2640.369 --> 2645.08
alternative media with all the

2642.32 --> 2650.599
conspiracies is that there is now this

2645.08 --> 2654.17
big room for people to experiment and

2650.599 --> 2656.51
develop themselves mentally where there

2654.17 --> 2659.7200000000003
basically was none before when people

2656.51 --> 2662.869
had just were left to their devices in

2659.72 --> 2665.75
whatever book they bumped into and you

2662.869 --> 2668.51
were super lucky to bump into a person

2665.75 --> 2671.27
in real life that had conspiracy

2668.51 --> 2675.59
interest themselves and weren't like a

2671.27 --> 2677.54
total freak or like crazy guy that was

2675.59 --> 2680.06
just unbearable to deal with because

2677.54 --> 2682.0
that was what what was around like

2680.06 --> 2684.68
twenty years ago and thirty years ago

2682.0 --> 2687.83
the conspiracy nuts they were naughty

2684.68 --> 2691.5499999999997
people and now it's so in the open that

2687.83 --> 2694.4
anyone can like grasp with a little bit

2691.55 --> 2696.9500000000003
of lore here and there and do something

2694.4 --> 2701.06
with it let it inspire them to be

2696.95 --> 2704.5099999999998
creative or to add a piece of the puzzle

2701.06 --> 2709.2799999999997
to the whole thing or become part of a

2704.51 --> 2712.9700000000003
debating community it's it's a giant

2709.28 --> 2715.9500000000003
playground of knowledge and it's it's

2712.97 --> 2719.5299999999997
awesome I love it

2715.95 --> 2724.0
yeah and it's come you know with with

2719.53 --> 2727.03
thee the advancement of the internet I

2724.0 --> 2729.46
mean the internet 2006 we didn't but

2727.03 --> 2731.5600000000004
YouTube wasn't really in full effect it

2729.46 --> 2734.32
was just starting and now the catch

2731.56 --> 2737.44
videos yeah exactly

2734.32 --> 2740.2000000000003
net like now we have any anything any

2737.44 --> 2742.92
question that we have is right at our

2740.2 --> 2746.5299999999997
fingertips not that that's a good thing

2742.92 --> 2749.14
but it's a convenient thing so it was

2746.53 --> 2752.2000000000003
just as natural as a bound to happen

2749.14 --> 2754.15
and you know it oh yeah I had replica

2752.2 --> 2756.0299999999997
revelation you know we heard about this

2754.15 --> 2760.4500000000003
atmosphere the moon is in our atmosphere

2756.03 --> 2763.0
atmosphere so what what if they're just

2760.45 --> 2765.5499999999997
what if this is damage control because

2763.0 --> 2767.41
NASA's PR firm is just built us put out

2765.55 --> 2769.9
whatever who knows tomorrow they'll say

2767.41 --> 2771.79
like Saturn is really Jupiter and no one

2769.9 --> 2775.03
will bat nine I think they're just

2771.79 --> 2778.18
they're slowly gonna rain in the

2775.03 --> 2781.03
universe or the Sun and Moon burns for

2778.18 --> 2784.6299999999997
starters they're gonna start a narrative

2781.03 --> 2787.27
up where you know the moon is really a

2784.63 --> 2789.67
lot closer than we've suspected they

2787.27 --> 2791.77
drop these little bombs once in a while

2789.67 --> 2793.9
to say you know you know what we were

2791.77 --> 2796.21
wrong about that there's actually space

2793.9 --> 2800.92
clouds of been nebulas right outside of

2796.21 --> 2804.64
our you know 60 miles up phantom planet

2800.92 --> 2807.4300000000003
see that that Ron oh no mu never gonna

2804.64 --> 2811.33
happen no no they can break away from

2807.43 --> 2813.49
the heliocentric mathematical division

2811.33 --> 2815.29
of everything that system they can never

2813.49 --> 2818.0499999999997
walk away from that because that is the

2815.29 --> 2821.02
core foundation the heliocentric setup

2818.05 --> 2824.01
but what they can do is very other

2821.02 --> 2827.29
things about it like invisible factors

2824.01 --> 2829.51
gravity atmospheric conditions they can

2827.29 --> 2833.05
move around and maneuver without the

2829.51 --> 2833.4700000000003
magnetic fields and what I rant I went

2833.05 --> 2835.75
away again

2833.47 --> 2839.0
sorry Randy for

2835.75 --> 2841.19
anyway what I presume is gonna happen in

2839.0 --> 2844.0
that sense is they're gonna go to a more

2841.19 --> 2847.19
electric universe type model which is

2844.0 --> 2849.95
absolutely essential for them to even

2847.19 --> 2853.07
remotely be able to survive because at

2849.95 --> 2855.29
least it makes some damn sense and then

2853.07 --> 2858.04
they can move on to involving other

2855.29 --> 2863.09
weird theories like the concept that

2858.04 --> 2866.63
Jupiter may become a Sun and why because

2863.09 --> 2868.79
the Sun is not a big ball of fire it's

2866.63 --> 2871.9300000000003
actually a gas lamp that is being

2868.79 --> 2874.85
electrified causing all that light

2871.93 --> 2876.77
according to the Helios yeah to the

2874.85 --> 2878.54
electric universe concept and the same

2876.77 --> 2880.46
thing could happen to Jupiter because

2878.54 --> 2884.75
it's a giant ball of gas it's a matter

2880.46 --> 2886.94
of what electric point is it gonna enter

2884.75 --> 2888.13
and then turn into a freaking lamp that

2886.94 --> 2891.04
kind of [ __ ]

2888.13 --> 2897.2000000000003
that's what's gonna be on the menu weird

2891.04 --> 2901.34
extreme celestial events that there ya

2897.2 --> 2902.6299999999997
gonna have to tackle because otherwise

2901.34 --> 2905.36
just gonna be total chaos

2902.63 --> 2906.8900000000003
and like ah planets exploding what's

2905.36 --> 2908.36
going on that yeah that's the

2906.89 --> 2912.7999999999997
alternative and that doesn't make any

2908.36 --> 2915.17
damn sense you it does feel like they

2912.8 --> 2917.0
need to keep up ratings which is you

2915.17 --> 2918.98
know they have this they make this big

2917.0 --> 2921.65
celebration like it's absolutely

2918.98 --> 2923.72
ridiculous the crowd sounds that they're

2921.65 --> 2926.27
pumping in to these things and it's a

2923.72 --> 2929.24
psychological operation to like make

2926.27 --> 2931.88
people that aren't interested better

2929.24 --> 2934.52
laying there in front of their TV like I

2931.88 --> 2935.92
hear people cheering it sounds like a

2934.52 --> 2938.48
football game alright

2935.92 --> 2941.03
okay what's everybody cheering about oh

2938.48 --> 2946.73
yeah a rocket alright that's good

2941.03 --> 2949.52
mmm-hmm you know but that's like

2946.73 --> 2951.95
watching fireworks it's fun right how do

2949.52 --> 2953.78
people not understand that it's

2951.95 --> 2955.04
something that's like you know they land

2953.78 --> 2957.7400000000002
the rocket right you've seen that

2955.04 --> 2960.79
repetitive if something's going they

2957.74 --> 2965.2599999999998
didn't are you cannot correct

2960.79 --> 2967.5099999999998
and it's impossible impossible and why

2965.26 --> 2972.07
can't people see this now I disagree

2967.51 --> 2973.78
it's not impossible to correct yeah for

2972.07 --> 2977.71
this that's very simple you know how you

2973.78 --> 2989.65
do it by just with an arrow like an

2977.71 --> 2992.53
arrow has it has feathers on the end to

2989.65 --> 2995.17
correct itself to stabilize its path the

2992.53 --> 2998.32
weight propels it forward and this

2995.17 --> 3000.96
corrected in the wind so what all they

2998.32 --> 3005.7000000000003
really have to do is put thrusters on

3000.96 --> 3010.02
the nose tip on the top of it so it can

3005.7 --> 3013.5299999999997
fall down and then on the top correct it

3010.02 --> 3015.9
to make sure it stays vertical you can

3013.53 --> 3016.53
do it from the bottom that makes no damn

3015.9 --> 3018.6
sense

3016.53 --> 3020.3700000000003
you can't correct its trajectory from

3018.6 --> 3022.7999999999997
the bottom it has to go from the top

3020.37 --> 3025.2599999999998
then it could kind of work it's still

3022.8 --> 3027.3300000000004
kind of silly though but it can

3025.26 --> 3030.0600000000004
technically work I don't mean if they

3027.33 --> 3031.5
did it like that or if they proposed to

3030.06 --> 3035.04
have done it some other way but that's

3031.5 --> 3037.77
the way it could be done thrust is

3035.04 --> 3040.2
compensation at the top at the tip as it

3037.77 --> 3044.28
rice I would think they would want to

3040.2 --> 3047.0899999999997
shoot outwards laterally like if it's if

3044.28 --> 3050.0400000000004
they're landing it like let's say

3047.09 --> 3052.25
they're kind of they got a correct for

3050.04 --> 3055.11
left to right yah

3052.25 --> 3057.24
shoot out the sides keep the thrust in

3055.11 --> 3060.1
the bottom

3057.24 --> 3061.39
right but still in that video there's

3060.1 --> 3063.49
the doesn't you don't see any of that

3061.39 --> 3066.91
you see like that's right because nuns

3063.49 --> 3069.3999999999996
faker does it mean that it couldn't

3066.91 --> 3071.47
actually happen though but just a little

3069.4 --> 3073.3
trick tit first just like with the

3071.47 --> 3076.45
moon-landing they love to do that [ __ ]

3073.3 --> 3079.9900000000002
that's even like a myth they're creating

3076.45 --> 3082.6299999999997
it's like we do it fake first because

3079.99 --> 3085.12
that's cheaper and then it and then

3082.63 --> 3088.27
gives more incentive for people to get

3085.12 --> 3089.7999999999997
behind it more media momentum and at the

3088.27 --> 3092.35
same time in the background we're

3089.8 --> 3094.4500000000003
actually doing it for real and then we

3092.35 --> 3098.0499999999997
might be inclined not to show any of

3094.45 --> 3101.37
that ever still do it but only show the

3098.05 --> 3104.19
fake [ __ ] so it can be copied by a

3101.37 --> 3108.72
opposing force blah blah blah espionage

3104.19 --> 3114.94
that's [ __ ] or to [ __ ] with our minds

3108.72 --> 3115.81
you're Richard Hoagland frequently on

3114.94 --> 3119.59
coast to coast

3115.81 --> 3122.65
he's uh he's the guy who purports that

3119.59 --> 3125.6200000000003
there are glass structures that NASA's

3122.65 --> 3127.51
NASA's not hiding it wasn't about the

3125.62 --> 3130.63
fake moon landing what NASA is really

3127.51 --> 3133.5400000000004
hiding are these glass structures that

3130.63 --> 3137.56
he swears around Cydonia and the moon

3133.54 --> 3141.99
yeah I've seen it he filmed he admits to

3137.56 --> 3145.81
this that CBS had a long side the the

3141.99 --> 3150.43
supposed real moon landing footage they

3145.81 --> 3155.08
had a fake mock-up like a something that

3150.43 --> 3157.87
they filmed to supplement or just in

3155.08 --> 3161.5
case like the the the footage cut out

3157.87 --> 3165.0699999999997
they'd have back up so he admits to this

3161.5 --> 3168.3
that they filmed the whole thing just in

3165.07 --> 3171.36
case but I mean I

3168.3 --> 3177.48
the NASA's also I've been noticing that

3171.36 --> 3179.4
they slip in what does that guy say it's

3177.48 --> 3184.59
gonna be the first time we keep actually

3179.4 --> 3188.9100000000003
send a man past the Van Allen belts

3184.59 --> 3192.2400000000002
radiation belts or we can have a man

3188.91 --> 3196.35
mission you know there's something weird

3192.24 --> 3199.7999999999997
about that how they're just sliding that

3196.35 --> 3207.0
like nonchalant about soon we'll be out

3199.8 --> 3210.8100000000004
of low Earth orbit right we can finally

3207.0 --> 3212.91
do what we were set out to do and not

3210.81 --> 3215.04
fake it and yeah we're not actually

3212.91 --> 3217.74
gonna say in the open we faked it

3215.04 --> 3219.48
because we're not allowed to national

3217.74 --> 3221.7
security but we're kind of already

3219.48 --> 3224.06
admitting it and we're now gonna do it

3221.7 --> 3224.06
for you

3230.2 --> 3238.39
I mean they run out of ideas at some

3232.18 --> 3241.72
point yeah no they're not beginning a

3238.39 --> 3245.62
saturation point they've claimed that

3241.72 --> 3246.8199999999997
they can get to Mars this is the when

3245.62 --> 3250.87
did they do it first they didn't like

3246.82 --> 3252.3700000000003
2007 2006 they had the Mars rover there

3250.87 --> 3256.27
yeah but how

3252.37 --> 3261.21
oh the Mars rover thing uh it apparently

3256.27 --> 3261.21
decide out - uh-huh the battery pack

3261.3 --> 3264.21
they're throwing in all these

3262.99 --> 3267.0699999999997
festivities

3264.21 --> 3269.85
Eddie Bravo's right you know YouTube and

3267.07 --> 3273.8500000000004
Google they love alien stuff

3269.85 --> 3279.46
I like alien stuff too I just don't take

3273.85 --> 3283.81
it seriously I do what do you take what

3279.46 --> 3287.44
are you into well I just recognized that

3283.81 --> 3289.93
that it is real it's just not probably

3287.44 --> 3291.76
not real in the way most people think

3289.93 --> 3294.58
about it including the ones that are

3291.76 --> 3303.3900000000003
actually getting the experiences have

3294.58 --> 3305.88
you had an experience well I tried

3303.39 --> 3308.43
let's just look I've had argument I've

3305.88 --> 3311.07
had super elaborate dark world

3308.43 --> 3315.6499999999996
experience in which I literally did see

3311.07 --> 3318.9900000000002
aliens and in which I also did see

3315.65 --> 3321.42
declared aliens that visually didn't

3318.99 --> 3324.8999999999996
actually appear to me as aliens but were

3321.42 --> 3326.79
designated as such and that's yeah

3324.9 --> 3328.86
that's when it gets really weird dark

3326.79 --> 3334.5
world stuff okay that's weird but yeah

3328.86 --> 3336.9300000000003
aliens they're basically a group that

3334.5 --> 3340.44
are just another pawn in the whole thing

3336.93 --> 3343.49
in the whole entire cosmic set up there

3340.44 --> 3345.75
just player another group of players

3343.49 --> 3347.79
that's it

3345.75 --> 3351.9
they're interdimensional they're not

3347.79 --> 3356.64
actually beings originally but they have

3351.9 --> 3361.56
vessels the drones the greys those are

3356.64 --> 3363.6
drones and I heard an interesting theory

3361.56 --> 3367.56
on the greys that you've seen the movie

3363.6 --> 3369.87
Avatar right avatar is uh that James

3367.56 --> 3372.93
Cameron movie where we apparently you

3369.87 --> 3374.73
could go you could use one of their

3372.93 --> 3377.0699999999997
vessel you could use one of those avatar

3374.73 --> 3379.53
creatures as like a vessel and that's

3377.07 --> 3383.07
how the guy was living on that that

3379.53 --> 3386.8500000000004
world with all the trees that the greys

3383.07 --> 3389.82
are like those and that someone else is

3386.85 --> 3391.37
using the greys as a vessel to travel

3389.82 --> 3394.32
around and do whatever they got to do

3391.37 --> 3397.31
right see through its possibility I've

3394.32 --> 3397.31
personally never

3398.6 --> 3405.5899999999997
can't say I've ever had any kind of

3402.32 --> 3409.4700000000003
anything other than my own spook ISM

3405.59 --> 3413.21
other than that man I think so soulless

3409.47 --> 3416.1899999999996
people the only thing I've experienced

3413.21 --> 3419.2200000000003
all right well aliens you know I've

3416.19 --> 3424.64
never met an alien suit before in the

3419.22 --> 3427.47
physical realm I've never had like truck

3424.64 --> 3430.95
experiences where aliens would come or

3427.47 --> 3433.35
even UFOs and look I tried this sort of

3430.95 --> 3436.23
didn't like go into heavy drugs for that

3433.35 --> 3440.43
on my own volition just cannabis mostly

3436.23 --> 3444.48
but yeah my first girlfriend ever when I

3440.43 --> 3451.74
was 18 oh I am so legal she was too but

3444.48 --> 3453.57
she was a x-files ufologist fanatic it's

3451.74 --> 3457.62
funny because she actually ended up

3453.57 --> 3460.26
studying theology I would figure that

3457.62 --> 3462.72
when I that's weird but yeah she was a

3460.26 --> 3464.67
fanatic and we would like on a daily

3462.72 --> 3467.97
basis she actually came to live with me

3464.67 --> 3470.64
it was such a weird time but with me and

3467.97 --> 3472.7099999999996
my parents but yeah she would be like

3470.64 --> 3475.41
with binoculars in the garden at night

3472.71 --> 3478.4700000000003
like look I'm not gonna see me UFO I'm

3475.41 --> 3480.42
gonna see like that fanatical and I went

3478.47 --> 3484.7999999999997
with her and I like tried I tried I've

3480.42 --> 3489.03
never seen once UFO any kind of thing

3484.8 --> 3493.02
anything ever just yeah I went to you

3489.03 --> 3495.1200000000003
for UFO conferences and heard people

3493.02 --> 3497.34
about crop circles which is still

3495.12 --> 3500.8199999999997
extremely fascinating to me it's still

3497.34 --> 3503.79
one of the bigger weird little mysteries

3500.82 --> 3506.73
that is just like what the [ __ ] you know

3503.79 --> 3510.36
and there's no not a lot of tie in it's

3506.73 --> 3513.72
just what the [ __ ] what is that and yeah

3510.36 --> 3516.75
UFO abduction experiences which was to

3513.72 --> 3520.1699999999996
me extremely obvious people getting on

3516.75 --> 3521.76
hard drugs and then basically entering

3520.17 --> 3523.86
the dark world meeting

3521.76 --> 3528.15
a bunch of alien-like beings that would

3523.86 --> 3531.33
then fly them off to the other dimension

3528.15 --> 3532.4100000000003
to another realm and their ship and blah

3531.33 --> 3534.87
blah blah

3532.41 --> 3537.39
very obviously they had no conception

3534.87 --> 3540.0899999999997
whatsoever of any kind of transition

3537.39 --> 3543.17
because I did like like a a journalist

3540.09 --> 3546.15
went to them like okay do you remember

3543.17 --> 3550.14
the transition between you sitting

3546.15 --> 3554.1
physically in your room and you walking

3550.14 --> 3555.87
to a ship the route you took the the

3554.1 --> 3558.12
feeling transitions and when you

3555.87 --> 3561.15
actually realized you were moving away

3558.12 --> 3564.6
like and they just do they were like I

3561.15 --> 3568.8
don't know I'm a freaking brain-dead

3564.6 --> 3572.58
drug addict [ __ ] so it was like okay

3568.8 --> 3574.23
this is completely useless these people

3572.58 --> 3575.79
don't even know what they went through

3574.23 --> 3578.82
they just had these memories and it's

3575.79 --> 3581.42
just a big drug trip so that's probably

3578.82 --> 3584.79
a lot of UFO encounters are just heavily

3581.42 --> 3587.13
drug-related but at the same time yeah

3584.79 --> 3590.79
there's also things like cow mutilations

3587.13 --> 3593.7200000000003
and such and how do you how do you

3590.79 --> 3598.5
explain that well that could be like

3593.72 --> 3601.56
just weird agency experimental [ __ ]

3598.5 --> 3603.48
happening there yeah and that's kind of

3601.56 --> 3607.77
tied in and what I think is that the

3603.48 --> 3611.19
agencies have been using the helis

3607.77 --> 3613.5
energetic properties and the concept of

3611.19 --> 3617.04
aliens that are encountered within it as

3613.5 --> 3622.41
a cover to basically do experiments [ __ ]

3617.04 --> 3624.81
and blaming it on the aliens in one of

3622.41 --> 3626.85
them on the first line on the first wave

3624.81 --> 3629.07
because they're they've gone much

3626.85 --> 3633.81
further than this they've now built a

3629.07 --> 3636.06
complete interstellar narrative men in

3633.81 --> 3638.49
black type scenario communications with

3636.06 --> 3643.06
aliens and actually

3638.49 --> 3645.52
doing more stuff producing well maybe

3643.06 --> 3648.64
these genetically modified humanoid

3645.52 --> 3650.41
creatures making alien suits that guy

3648.64 --> 3653.5299999999997
you know I don't know where it all went

3650.41 --> 3658.17
but they did a lot with it it's become

3653.53 --> 3658.17
part of what they do

3659.79 --> 3668.02
credo boudoir has an interesting story I

3663.45 --> 3673.3289999999997
know that he's uh it's like a Zulu shame

3668.02 --> 3674.67
and elder and I highly suggest you know

3673.329 --> 3677.349
there's one thing you could say about

3674.67 --> 3679.81
aliens it's not really about whether or

3677.349 --> 3682.569
not they're it's true or that anyone

3679.81 --> 3685.359
needs real proof it's that everyone is

3682.569 --> 3687.73
gonna listen to a good alien story you

3685.359 --> 3689.619
know matter who they are at once if it

3687.73 --> 3692.7400000000002
sounds good if someone's got a good hook

3689.619 --> 3696.119
on it in it I'll listen to it and just

3692.74 --> 3698.41
by nature of that by virtue of that

3696.119 --> 3701.589
there's there's a need for it there's a

3698.41 --> 3705.8799999999997
need for that sci-fi craving or defeat

3701.589 --> 3709.42
it but uh there is more to it because

3705.88 --> 3713.92
there really is more to it like you know

3709.42 --> 3716.9500000000003
why why do people see aliens sometimes

3713.92 --> 3719.73
when they are on drugs why do they have

3716.95 --> 3719.73
these expiry

3719.77 --> 3726.88
[Music]

3722.89 --> 3728.56
I think it depends on the person someone

3726.88 --> 3732.849
who like let's say someone didn't really

3728.56 --> 3735.2799999999997
someone wasn't able to explain what they

3732.849 --> 3737.26
were seeing and they took hallucinogens

3735.28 --> 3740.26
loose energetic drug right it'd be

3737.26 --> 3742.96
probably I proposed for them to say oh

3740.26 --> 3744.9700000000003
my god and alien would mean while they

3742.96 --> 3746.7400000000002
could say oh that's just my friend over

3744.97 --> 3749.6499999999996
there who looks crazy right now he's

3746.74 --> 3753.52
worth being that he it's dark or the

3749.65 --> 3755.7400000000002
lights and the drugs its face is

3753.52 --> 3759.7599999999998
obscured and he looks like an alien it's

3755.74 --> 3762.9199999999996
just like the go-to word but I have a

3759.76 --> 3767.46
feeling that some of these people

3762.92 --> 3769.92
like Alex Collier for instance he tells

3767.46 --> 3773.85
a really interesting story what was that

3769.92 --> 3775.77
no Alex Collier came out in 1994 what

3773.85 --> 3781.08
some interesting stories about how he

3775.77 --> 3784.92
was contacting Andromeda's there's a guy

3781.08 --> 3788.19
named Randy Cramer who apparently was on

3784.92 --> 3795.0
Mars for 17 years as marine he was one

3788.19 --> 3797.01
of the super-soldier mile ahead what you

3795.0 --> 3801.27
gotta check out Randy Cramer so you

3797.01 --> 3803.1600000000003
gotta check out his story it's just hey

3801.27 --> 3805.53
I mean regardless of whether or not you

3803.16 --> 3808.95
believe what he's saying he tells the

3805.53 --> 3810.8100000000004
story as if it really happened he does a

3808.95 --> 3813.8399999999997
great job maybe it was rehearsed there's

3810.81 --> 3817.59
something like that I don't know but man

3813.84 --> 3820.4100000000003
what a [ __ ] killer story he gives all

3817.59 --> 3824.76
the names and like the name of the of

3820.41 --> 3827.04
the post and the training regiment that

3824.76 --> 3829.7700000000004
they had to go through and some of the

3827.04 --> 3831.81
medical procedures he talks about having

3829.77 --> 3834.45
to go to these ancient artifacts of Mars

3831.81 --> 3836.94
where they go into this like large

3834.45 --> 3839.25
Cathedral or this like a church and they

3836.94 --> 3841.05
were Reptoids the good ones and then

3839.25 --> 3841.74
there were the reptilians these guys are

3841.05 --> 3843.63
really badass

3841.74 --> 3847.14
he's describing all the weapons that

3843.63 --> 3850.11
they had javelins Lance's science

3847.14 --> 3853.3799999999997
fiction a baby but I mean he's doing it

3850.11 --> 3855.9900000000002
like on the spot you know he's it sounds

3853.38 --> 3859.38
like a guy who who's been there now

3855.99 --> 3862.83
obviously he was never there but he had

3859.38 --> 3866.19
to been put through some sort of I I do

3862.83 --> 3869.94
believe that the my lab program is alive

3866.19 --> 3875.53
and healthy like what's his name Spears

3869.94 --> 3879.87
the guy who died the opposed guy he was

3875.53 --> 3884.92
his name's something Spears back spears

3879.87 --> 3887.0499999999997
Mac Spears my lab is military objection

3884.92 --> 3890.92
so they take kids when they're young and

3887.05 --> 3893.8300000000004
they put him into a program and it's

3890.92 --> 3896.92
pretty much like Manchurian candidates

3893.83 --> 3898.39
most of them don't last past 31 years

3896.92 --> 3900.2200000000003
old that's usually when they

3898.39 --> 3902.35
extinguished them they get rid of them

3900.22 --> 3905.3199999999997
this guy's stories that he was taken

3902.35 --> 3908.2
when he was like 17 years old and he was

3905.32 --> 3910.78
brought into the Marines and zebra Force

3908.2 --> 3913.0
One or something like that on Mars and

3910.78 --> 3915.5800000000004
he talked he talks about this one battle

3913.0 --> 3917.98
that he had where all these guys went in

3915.58 --> 3921.5499999999997
and he said he's had arms ripped off

3917.98 --> 3924.25
that they replace him and just his head

3921.55 --> 3925.9900000000002
exploded he had two like these all of

3924.25 --> 3927.61
his friends had died at least once as

3925.99 --> 3929.35
long as like the brain doesn't die they

3927.61 --> 3932.38
can put you back together through this

3929.35 --> 3935.7999999999997
holographic procedure but when he talks

3932.38 --> 3939.9700000000003
about what a holographic procedure good

3935.8 --> 3942.67
morning guys Hey okay that sorry but if

3939.97 --> 3945.31
a holographic procedure you say okay

3942.67 --> 3947.77
well let me break it to you that's not

3945.31 --> 3950.89
in the physical world that's not the

3947.77 --> 3952.03
physical world that's not the physical

3950.89 --> 3957.31
world

3952.03 --> 3960.0400000000004
that's dark world he talks about it how

3957.31 --> 3962.77
they pretty much they get like a hop a

3960.04 --> 3968.56
hologram of the limb that they need to

3962.77 --> 3970.29
repair or it's it's overlaid on to the

3968.56 --> 3973.93
body part so let's say it's your arm

3970.29 --> 3976.33
they'll have a hologram of it right

3973.93 --> 3979.0899999999997
where your arm is in place and the

3976.33 --> 3981.7
doctors would use that as like a UH as

3979.09 --> 3983.6200000000003
like a stencil it's like a

3981.7 --> 3985.6
three-dimensional stencil so they'll

3983.62 --> 3988.8399999999997
look at the tendons whatever they need

3985.6 --> 3991.0899999999997
to like read you know connect not like

3988.84 --> 3993.01
the hologram does anything it's just

3991.09 --> 3996.52
I've heard this content where where did

3993.01 --> 3998.6800000000003
you hear this Randy Cramer yes that's

3996.52 --> 4001.0099999999998
why I heard it so the battle sequence

3998.68 --> 4002.91
right when he's in this ancient

4001.01 --> 4005.3100000000004
Cathedral or whatever it is it's like a

4002.91 --> 4007.2
big pyramid these guys enter it all of a

4005.31 --> 4008.5299999999997
sudden all these windows all these

4007.2 --> 4010.72
hatches open up

4008.53 --> 4011.6800000000003
and he said it was like it was like a

4010.72 --> 4015.1299999999997
tornado

4011.68 --> 4017.95
all these reptilian winged reptilians

4015.13 --> 4019.9900000000002
right gigantic blades came in he said it

4017.95 --> 4023.14
was like a blender and they just swirled

4019.99 --> 4026.2299999999996
around and they'll his his troop or

4023.14 --> 4028.0899999999997
platoon we're like all back to back

4026.23 --> 4029.14
squeezed into the center and he said

4028.09 --> 4032.32
everyone who's just dropping like flies

4029.14 --> 4034.24
got cut in half and it just they swirled

4032.32 --> 4037.8700000000003
around and then literally incinerated

4034.24 --> 4039.7
all this his entire like troop or

4037.87 --> 4042.3599999999997
whatever you want to call platoon it is

4039.7 --> 4045.73
like him and another guy made it out

4042.36 --> 4048.19
it's worth it listening to it listen to

4045.73 --> 4050.7
what the guy is to say it has been okay

4048.19 --> 4055.66
I'll say you can get quite bizarre

4050.7 --> 4059.16
spirit battles are total magic total and

4055.66 --> 4062.14
as if you're going in there as a human

4059.16 --> 4064.81
not even realizing that it's not

4062.14 --> 4067.15
physical reality yeah you're gonna be

4064.81 --> 4071.11
screwed because the creatures in there

4067.15 --> 4075.73
do know and they have mastered how

4071.11 --> 4079.63
things work in there so it's like being

4075.73 --> 4082.51
in a fantasy literally not knowing

4079.63 --> 4085.03
you're in a fantasy going up against

4082.51 --> 4088.36
fantasy characters that do know they are

4085.03 --> 4090.3700000000003
Fenton in the fantasy and can yeah it's

4088.36 --> 4093.1
like going up in a dream against

4090.37 --> 4096.93
somebody who's lucid dreaming in a

4093.1 --> 4099.79
perfect state you were screwed so

4096.93 --> 4102.22
doesn't this though somehow this stuff

4099.79 --> 4104.859
was really interesting like where I came

4102.22 --> 4108.0
in because it was funny that when I

4104.859 --> 4112.509
turned you on once it was talking about

4108.0 --> 4114.759
Richard Hoagland and I had so funny I

4112.509 --> 4117.73
used the listen to that guy like you

4114.759 --> 4121.029
know like it was curious to he'll

4117.73 --> 4122.74
talking about I know now to me yeah but

4121.029 --> 4125.4400000000005
but I was like whoa what the hell is

4122.74 --> 4129.759
this guy's England well with the face of

4125.44 --> 4131.65
Mars [ __ ] and hid the the the class

4129.759 --> 4134.71
structures on the moon I was like where

4131.65 --> 4137.2
are they going with this as long as they

4134.71 --> 4139.18
face on Mars Earth's is fear because

4137.2 --> 4141.3099999999995
I've been landed on the moon it's just

4139.18 --> 4144.04
it's all like sleight of hand kind

4141.31 --> 4146.319
thing yeah you know it's keeping the

4144.04 --> 4148.51
keeping the narrative going making

4146.319 --> 4151.569
things interesting you looking up there

4148.51 --> 4154.06
and you're not really looking here you

4151.569 --> 4158.47
know how I knew of the face of Mars and

4154.06 --> 4162.069
the pyramids of Mars through a computer

4158.47 --> 4164.77
game on my Commodore 64 called Zack

4162.069 --> 4167.080000000001
McCracken an adventure game where a

4164.77 --> 4169.900000000001
bunch of where one pawn point part of

4167.08 --> 4172.93
the game a bunch of hippies transform

4169.9 --> 4176.139999999999
their bus into a spacecraft according to

4172.93 --> 4179.02
a hallucination dream from aliens then

4176.14 --> 4183.819
they use that to go to Mars to enter in

4179.02 --> 4187.63
in giant pyramids there and that's like

4183.819 --> 4194.35
in the freaking 80s on a computer game

4187.63 --> 4197.29
that was like super basic okay so yeah

4194.35 --> 4200.59
you heard of James Gallo and he's the

4197.29 --> 4201.13
guy out in California no I'm sorry not

4200.59 --> 4204.7300000000005
California

4201.13 --> 4208.96
I think it's bored so it's either organs

4204.73 --> 4211.419999999999
or water James James Galland he runs the

4208.96 --> 4214.84
et cetera right and he's the one who

4211.42 --> 4217.21
hosts those viewing parties okay people

4214.84 --> 4220.96
are out in the field and whenever they

4217.21 --> 4223.39
congregate lights appear above I think

4220.96 --> 4224.64
it's Mount Adams that's not the

4223.39 --> 4230.34
what's-his-name

4224.64 --> 4234.34
the doctor was that doctor's name [ __ ]

4230.34 --> 4236.9800000000005
Steven Greer that was a hell no no no no

4234.34 --> 4241.96
Greer's full of [ __ ] yeah but I mean

4236.98 --> 4244.48
Greer did a lot of he didn't he he made

4241.96 --> 4247.6
some headway for the people you know I

4244.48 --> 4250.24
mean yeah it was a little interesting

4247.6 --> 4253.150000000001
that he was you know he had that whole

4250.24 --> 4255.2699999999995
congressional thing the aliens and all

4253.15 --> 4257.95
these people talking about it but I

4255.27 --> 4259.900000000001
don't know nothing ever happened with me

4257.95 --> 4262.96
so it was just like a big show for

4259.9 --> 4267.549999999999
nothing you know they all thought

4262.96 --> 4270.07
disclosure was coming it's like they got

4267.55 --> 4277.12
disclosure except they didn't like the

4270.07 --> 4278.91
answer it's like the answer yeah but you

4277.12 --> 4283.33
know that understood this one down huh

4278.91 --> 4286.93
and it's Mount Shasta that's the guy

4283.33 --> 4288.76
James gallon so he set up a ranch he's

4286.93 --> 4291.01
got an interesting story he's not a kook

4288.76 --> 4294.610000000001
or anything but did you ever read about

4291.01 --> 4296.77
the or hear about the job you were

4294.61 --> 4299.08
talking about that the Mars shaped the

4296.77 --> 4301.120000000001
reptiles get over here about like who

4299.08 --> 4305.04
was it with the jump room did you ever

4301.12 --> 4309.5199999999995
hear about Andrew basiago basiago yes

4305.04 --> 4312.21
every remember that's his story a coast

4309.52 --> 4315.67
to coast was grateful all this nonsense

4312.21 --> 4318.52
ory hits home with me because where he

4315.67 --> 4320.41
was brought into the DARPA program DARPA

4318.52 --> 4321.76
was using the Curtis Wright building

4320.41 --> 4324.51
Curtis Wright used to manufacture

4321.76 --> 4328.030000000001
airplane engines back in World War 2 era

4324.51 --> 4328.66
they had a facility in Woodridge New

4328.03 --> 4331.75
Jersey

4328.66 --> 4334.63
my uncle lives in Woodridge New Jersey

4331.75 --> 4337.15
okay my father's brother every Christmas

4334.63 --> 4339.75
every holiday we'd be there behind his

4337.15 --> 4342.49
house is a fence in a long road and

4339.75 --> 4344.4
there's a another that's it that the

4342.49 --> 4348.01
road is closed off to the public and

4344.4 --> 4351.16
there's like kind of like street like

4348.01 --> 4353.38
woods that that just look funky like

4351.16 --> 4356.17
this there's metal grading in the woods

4353.38 --> 4357.49
like maybe 50 feet into it you could

4356.17 --> 4358.6900000000005
tell that they're blocking something

4357.49 --> 4360.01
there's something in the woods that they

4358.69 --> 4364.54
don't want people to go and mess around

4360.01 --> 4366.280000000001
with the facility was right back there

4364.54 --> 4370.0
so that's where DARPA had their their

4366.28 --> 4372.28
[ __ ] set up fast forward to 2017

4370.0 --> 4374.47
I'm detailing this guy's car in

4372.28 --> 4377.32
Moonachie New Jersey which is right next

4374.47 --> 4380.29
door to Wood Ridge and I'm like hey do

4377.32 --> 4384.219999999999
you know anything about supposed Curtis

4380.29 --> 4386.62
right the airplane hangar he's like dude

4384.22 --> 4388.84
when I was a kid we used to take our

4386.62 --> 4391.0599999999995
bikes and we used to ride down there and

4388.84 --> 4392.860000000001
let me tell you something it was like an

4391.06 --> 4395.17
underground bunker where you could

4392.86 --> 4397.42
literally turn an airplane around like

4395.17 --> 4399.88
you'd be taxi a small airplane

4397.42 --> 4402.88
and he said it was you'd be on ground

4399.88 --> 4405.01
level and then it would open up and you

4402.88 --> 4408.7300000000005
would just go down and to like this

4405.01 --> 4410.860000000001
large opening this cavern is opening you

4408.73 --> 4412.57
could still check it out on Google Earth

4410.86 --> 4414.969999999999
you could see some of the remaining

4412.57 --> 4417.099999999999
buildings I would say within the next

4414.97 --> 4420.88
two years all the remaining all the old

4417.1 --> 4427.21
buildings are gonna be gone so basiago

4420.88 --> 4428.53
story says that in 1973 he was taken by

4427.21 --> 4432.34
his father his father worked for DARPA

4428.53 --> 4434.53
and he basically took Andrew and brought

4432.34 --> 4437.4400000000005
him into the program and there was a

4434.53 --> 4439.84
jump room there apparently they can

4437.44 --> 4442.419999999999
teleport from there to New Mexico I

4439.84 --> 4443.9800000000005
don't really I'm sure yeah I don't

4442.42 --> 4446.14
really get too crazy with the jumping

4443.98 --> 4446.98
[ __ ] what's more interesting is the

4446.14 --> 4449.9800000000005
chronovisor

4446.98 --> 4453.25
technology that he talks about and how

4449.98 --> 4457.0599999999995
they focus intense light on a crystal

4453.25 --> 4460.95
and the ceiling and this the the crystal

4457.06 --> 4464.700000000001
would basically light up the floor and

4460.95 --> 4467.05
create like a large hologram of like

4464.7 --> 4472.0599999999995
anything you've seen holograms before I

4467.05 --> 4474.88
it's just light and that's how they can

4472.06 --> 4478.54
manipulate or travel better time and

4474.88 --> 4481.39
he'd the way he tells it it's cool cuz

4478.54 --> 4484.0
the cuz the guys the guy's not an idiot

4481.39 --> 4485.62
but he's coming from some nah he's not

4484.0 --> 4487.75
in it I don't know what his angle is

4485.62 --> 4490.0
because he's really intelligent he's a

4487.75 --> 4496.15
lawyer and he's not selling nothing

4490.0 --> 4499.75
that's another thing hey what's up said

4496.15 --> 4502.0
back and according to basiago when you

4499.75 --> 4504.88
go back in time you create another

4502.0 --> 4507.64
timeline Bozzio that sounds like a hate

4504.88 --> 4510.33
to that if it cheese no but look i've

4507.64 --> 4512.62
speculated about time travel and i

4510.33 --> 4515.23
conceive that it's basically impossible

4512.62 --> 4517.72
to ever return to the original state

4515.23 --> 4520.66
from where you left okay no matter what

4517.72 --> 4522.97
I'll buy that yeah for sure

4520.66 --> 4525.58
somewhere I literally go to another

4522.97 --> 4530.59
dimension because the one you came from

4525.58 --> 4532.36
no longer exists even though it would be

4530.59 --> 4536.56
to make everything consistent doesn't

4532.36 --> 4538.389999999999
matter it's just a material leader when

4536.56 --> 4541.870000000001
you're talking about going backwards in

4538.39 --> 4546.070000000001
time right I think okay so like what if

4541.87 --> 4550.09
you did return back to your place you

4546.07 --> 4553.15
came from whatever the date was but it

4550.09 --> 4556.3
had all the changes that would have been

4553.15 --> 4556.9
made you know from things you did in the

4556.3 --> 4559.84
past

4556.9 --> 4561.429999999999
like say you killed a president or

4559.84 --> 4564.91
something that's gonna be a pretty big

4561.43 --> 4567.37
change you know I'm saying or do you

4564.91 --> 4571.0
think you can't return at all there's I

4567.37 --> 4573.79
know physically oh because look I

4571.0 --> 4577.0
speculate since since I believe in the

4573.79 --> 4580.81
pattern and the pattern the structure of

4577.0 --> 4583.78
all things logos the total structure the

4580.81 --> 4586.620000000001
pattern if you're gonna potentially move

4583.78 --> 4590.32
back do something return there's

4586.62 --> 4593.68
absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that

4590.32 --> 4595.9
any of it since the moment you arrived

4593.68 --> 4598.72
back there is gonna turn out in the same

4595.9 --> 4602.08
way at all so it's a great likelihood

4598.72 --> 4604.18
that you will never exist everything

4602.08 --> 4607.3
that happened right there won't exist

4604.18 --> 4610.54
things will just proceed in completely

4607.3 --> 4613.6
different ways that's what I think will

4610.54 --> 4618.34
happen well what about this the fact

4613.6 --> 4620.55
that even the present moment is a it's

4618.34 --> 4624.91
almost like a butterfly effect there's

4620.55 --> 4626.89
it's it's a timelines so like what we're

4624.91 --> 4630.3099999999995
doing right now like me joining the

4626.89 --> 4633.490000000001
panel that was one timeline another

4630.31 --> 4637.54
timeline could have been I went to sleep

4633.49 --> 4641.5599999999995
or went to another show whatever but and

4637.54 --> 4643.51
they're all great likely choices but

4641.56 --> 4647.620000000001
this is the one that we're experiencing

4643.51 --> 4650.29
now and and another reality it could

4647.62 --> 4654.25
have been me watching something else

4650.29 --> 4657.91
just to give an example so reflecting on

4654.25 --> 4661.33
time is different and experiencing the

4657.91 --> 4663.04
moment in other words if let's say Arwen

4661.33 --> 4667.11
goes back in time

4663.04 --> 4671.38
and he shoots my grandfather

4667.11 --> 4675.54
no I would you know it's not like that

4671.38 --> 4678.04
means his timeline of change right there

4675.54 --> 4679.84
but then again I don't really think you

4678.04 --> 4681.37
know what is time anyway time is just

4679.84 --> 4686.59
the measurement and how long does that

4681.37 --> 4692.28
measure - how could you pray my time is

4686.59 --> 4696.37
the condition by which the material

4692.28 --> 4699.099999999999
progression happens it's it's the

4696.37 --> 4701.8
entropy it allows entropy it allows

4699.1 --> 4705.04
change so time is only the measurement

4701.8 --> 4707.68
by which things proceed as it were so

4705.04 --> 4715.3
why call it time because we got to give

4707.68 --> 4719.740000000001
it a name so here's the real question

4715.3 --> 4723.49
call it Chronos how about this the real

4719.74 --> 4726.34
question so if we know going back in

4723.49 --> 4728.92
time and doing anything like even

4726.34 --> 4731.38
breathing air you're literally changing

4728.92 --> 4733.93
the future right like those couple

4731.38 --> 4737.4400000000005
oxygen molecules aren't there anymore

4733.93 --> 4740.41
you breathe in whatever or you you

4737.44 --> 4742.83
killed somebody it's even different as

4740.41 --> 4747.28
soon as you would physically displace

4742.83 --> 4749.71
something right to another in line well

4747.28 --> 4753.16
anything that's gonna be staying behind

4749.71 --> 4755.9800000000005
we'll just regard it as something

4753.16 --> 4758.92
completely disintegrating forever the

4755.98 --> 4760.719999999999
material will be lost but which may be

4758.92 --> 4764.26
others yeah it will enter a new

4760.72 --> 4767.5
dimension that resembles the timeline

4764.26 --> 4770.5
okay so this is what I was trying to get

4767.5 --> 4773.35
at is the very fact of going back in

4770.5 --> 4779.44
time you're you're changing things right

4773.35 --> 4781.570000000001
and we're in a we're in a state of like

4779.44 --> 4783.37
picking different timelines at every

4781.57 --> 4786.07
second so this timeline stomach and

4783.37 --> 4790.51
there's like a path that is forged with

4786.07 --> 4793.0599999999995
reality so the point is what use would

4790.51 --> 4796.27
it be for anyone to try to go back in

4793.06 --> 4796.75
time to change anything because they're

4796.27 --> 4798.610000000001
gonna

4796.75 --> 4800.23
fact the timeline that has nothing to do

4798.61 --> 4802.54
with me right now

4800.23 --> 4804.669999999999
exams and butts actually they're very

4802.54 --> 4807.7
good points it would only be for them

4804.67 --> 4811.03
but they're also moving through they're

4807.7 --> 4813.22
also going into the future as they go

4811.03 --> 4816.5199999999995
their future exhibit their future

4813.22 --> 4818.47
consists of time travel but we're always

4816.52 --> 4821.080000000001
moving forward and that can't be stopped

4818.47 --> 4822.88
so this idea really only exists in the

4821.08 --> 4824.74
mind so if you are going to travel in

4822.88 --> 4829.51
time well you would only be able to do

4824.74 --> 4832.21
it without your body the mind is hey

4829.51 --> 4833.92
Chuck what's up ease are you doing that

4832.21 --> 4847.81
I don't think I've been on a panel with

4833.92 --> 4850.12
you so sweet if you go haha whose

4847.81 --> 4852.88
timeline gets changed the person that

4850.12 --> 4858.01
goes back for everybody else the person

4852.88 --> 4861.1
that goes back only is very the people

4858.01 --> 4863.26
that that person is experiencing with me

4861.1 --> 4868.030000000001
that's just what in their money in his

4863.26 --> 4870.31
mind you know no it was just it's just

4868.03 --> 4872.7699999999995
an abstract thing thinking I was

4870.31 --> 4874.450000000001
thinking about cuz it's like this whole

4872.77 --> 4877.06
time travel [ __ ] is weird

4874.45 --> 4879.79
yeah what cinema facilitates and you

4877.06 --> 4883.75
know what like I'm such a superhero geek

4879.79 --> 4888.06
right so I do watch superhero shows

4883.75 --> 4891.64
still and I love the flash the flash

4888.06 --> 4893.620000000001
focuses a lot on this aspect of time

4891.64 --> 4895.780000000001
travel because the flash is you know

4893.62 --> 4899.849999999999
obviously in the show he's so fast that

4895.78 --> 4899.849999999999
he can run through timelines and [ __ ]

4901.53 --> 4909.5199999999995
yeah I gotta give a little quick thing

4904.45 --> 4913.24
before I forget it too though I'm

4909.52 --> 4915.070000000001
already forgetting I'm sorry change the

4913.24 --> 4918.91
timeline wait must be the pace keep

4915.07 --> 4920.98
talking keep talking keep talking let me

4918.91 --> 4923.5599999999995
know so like I just wanted to smell like

4920.98 --> 4927.04
when I watched the flash like it's so

4923.56 --> 4928.04
crazy how they use obviously they're

4927.04 --> 4932.45
using speed

4928.04 --> 4935.24
to manipulate time and they go into how

4932.45 --> 4939.2
time lines change like he goes back in

4935.24 --> 4941.66
time to try to fix things and then it

4939.2 --> 4944.3
walks up the time line and you know I

4941.66 --> 4945.82
have gone back into the future type [ __ ]

4944.3 --> 4950.68
okay ready

4945.82 --> 4952.5199999999995
okay so like our brains are the original

4950.68 --> 4956.27
time machines

4952.52 --> 4961.040000000001
aka quantum computers actually most

4956.27 --> 4961.700000000001
people are experiencing the past or the

4961.04 --> 4965.03
future

4961.7 --> 4967.3099999999995
they're time-traveling at all all points

4965.03 --> 4970.16
of their life almost their entire life

4967.31 --> 4972.080000000001
most people are time-traveling they're

4970.16 --> 4974.26
either thinking of something about the

4972.08 --> 4977.29
future or their dwelling on the past

4974.26 --> 4981.92
very very few people are actually

4977.29 --> 4984.71
experiencing now now I can as it is as

4981.92 --> 4991.49
it is and I'm talking about this very

4984.71 --> 4993.8
moment now that's well I decide the mind

4991.49 --> 4995.78
the imagination right content play

4993.8 --> 4998.27
that's a sub realm that's not the

4995.78 --> 4999.98
ambassador reality right and that's

4998.27 --> 5003.22
where the first time travel is gonna

4999.98 --> 5008.259999999999
gonna end up you know coming now okay

5003.22 --> 5009.97
you just don't realize no I mean yeah

5008.26 --> 5018.58
yeah I don't but the point is

5009.97 --> 5022.68
hold on points oh Jesus Christ dude the

5018.58 --> 5022.68
whole the whole point is though that um

5023.04 --> 5029.26
okay

5024.22 --> 5031.87
yep you guys do sort of I mean I'm just

5029.26 --> 5034.12
guessing I'm asking y'all believe in the

5031.87 --> 5038.32
fact that you can manifest things with

5034.12 --> 5040.63
your thoughts how about that no I gotta

5038.32 --> 5044.17
say no to things okay what do you and

5040.63 --> 5048.13
find anything anything in event an event

5044.17 --> 5051.34
a situation material possession you know

5048.13 --> 5054.16
what I know no we cannot yeah the fine

5051.34 --> 5058.51
manifest no we don't manifest anything

5054.16 --> 5061.389
but what we can do let me answer it what

5058.51 --> 5064.869000000001
we can do however is allow

5061.389 --> 5069.429
mine's to attune to the interdimensional

5064.869 --> 5072.728999999999
universe - what to find the right path

5069.429 --> 5077.289
in order to let the world confront you

5072.729 --> 5080.05
with it that's how I okay yeah yeah

5077.289 --> 5082.869
that's exactly how I see it by the way

5080.05 --> 5084.999
and that's what I meant by manifest I'm

5082.869 --> 5089.53
not talking about the New Age like BAM

5084.999 --> 5094.57
there's some [ __ ] just ayodhya right

5089.53 --> 5098.349
hold on connection the right path wait

5094.57 --> 5103.09
wait stop no no this is the crux of the

5098.349 --> 5105.369000000001
whole thing so if if you can think of

5103.09 --> 5108.189
something enough for instance to like

5105.369 --> 5112.419
change a time line to where you get

5108.189 --> 5116.6990000000005
there then by the very nature is there

5112.419 --> 5120.34
such a thing as retrograde causality

5116.699 --> 5124.629999999999
which is by thinking or feeling

5120.34 --> 5127.689
something you cause a situation in your

5124.63 --> 5132.34
life to happen that actually changed the

5127.689 --> 5135.999000000001
past no you ever I heard about the

5132.34 --> 5138.459
legend it's total [ __ ] what is the

5135.999 --> 5141.76
legend though I don't know and by

5138.459 --> 5146.079
focusing change history no you cannot

5141.76 --> 5150.159000000001
know what you can do what you can do

5146.079 --> 5153.03
however is figure out the aberrations of

5150.159 --> 5155.619
what you think happened in the past and

5153.03 --> 5158.409
then by passing it and actually

5155.619 --> 5161.199
stumbling upon what actually happened

5158.409 --> 5164.009999999999
and realized that a lot of things that

5161.199 --> 5166.619
we do conceptualize about the past are

5164.01 --> 5170.709
aberrations are highly suggestive

5166.619 --> 5173.499
structures that come natural but are not

5170.709 --> 5176.369
actually real and that most of what we

5173.499 --> 5180.969
conceive of in the past is actually

5176.369 --> 5186.188999999999
literally that and yet it still works

5180.969 --> 5188.769
for us but yeah we can't retroactively

5186.189 --> 5190.809
ly change anything I've heard that myth

5188.769 --> 5193.030000000001
many times it's just not true the only

5190.809 --> 5194.02
thing we can really treat change is how

5193.03 --> 5197.55
we see things

5194.02 --> 5202.320000000001
and how we let what we see influence us

5197.55 --> 5206.16
and that's a big influence it's huge

5202.32 --> 5209.23
huge that's why religion for example

5206.16 --> 5212.62
dedicated religion of any type can have

5209.23 --> 5214.929999999999
a massive influence on somebody's mind

5212.62 --> 5217.93
and how they conduct their life how they

5214.93 --> 5221.35
are how they radiate because how you

5217.93 --> 5225.91
conceive of things matters a great deal

5221.35 --> 5228.76
on what you influence around you what

5225.91 --> 5235.8099999999995
energies you have access to that's the

5228.76 --> 5238.66
real thing that matters so yeah hey the

5235.81 --> 5241.660000000001
the point of the retrograde causality

5238.66 --> 5243.76
wasn't that you're literally trying to

5241.66 --> 5247.3
change anything from the past it's like

5243.76 --> 5249.820000000001
okay let me give you an example and and

5247.3 --> 5253.150000000001
check this out every example of

5249.82 --> 5256.719999999999
retrograde causality can be written off

5253.15 --> 5258.82
as a coincidence always okay so let's

5256.72 --> 5261.25
say you you were at a party all night

5258.82 --> 5263.469999999999
long like hundreds of people write a

5261.25 --> 5266.14
show and you're like one of the last

5263.47 --> 5267.79
people there and you're like dragging

5266.14 --> 5270.64
ass and you're like damn Oh wish I had

5267.79 --> 5273.88
some weed right now like that would top

5270.64 --> 5277.21
the night off and and what happens is

5273.88 --> 5279.07
you see a couch you know yeah and

5277.21 --> 5281.11
there's couches and I'm thinking of a

5279.07 --> 5284.41
rave by the way and this is the this

5281.11 --> 5286.54
story that I was told yeah so you see

5284.41 --> 5288.34
this couch and you you're just walking

5286.54 --> 5291.55
up to it it's almost like you sense

5288.34 --> 5295.63
something and right when you walk up to

5291.55 --> 5297.54
it you see a perfectly rolled going with

5295.63 --> 5301.39
like the best weed in it and everything

5297.54 --> 5303.55
okay now this is where and then you sit

5301.39 --> 5306.1
down on the couch and smoke it but this

5303.55 --> 5309.18
is where the retrograde causality comes

5306.1 --> 5314.530000000001
from you're trying to manifest something

5309.18 --> 5316.900000000001
now or in the future but by manifesting

5314.53 --> 5320.38
something now or in the future like

5316.9 --> 5323.7699999999995
having intense or wants or desires may

5320.38 --> 5326.11
actually change the past like a person

5323.77 --> 5327.9400000000005
sat down on that couch and they dropped

5326.11 --> 5330.67
a perfectly good joint

5327.94 --> 5336.639999999999
makes no sense like what pothead would

5330.67 --> 5339.7300000000005
ever just lose a nice ass [ __ ] Yeah

5336.64 --> 5343.4400000000005
right like every single one of them

5339.73 --> 5347.468999999999
every single one of them at one another

5343.44 --> 5350.62
I understand yes exactly and that one

5347.469 --> 5354.13
point or another may have been so that

5350.62 --> 5356.38
the next guy that needed it more could

5354.13 --> 5359.1990000000005
have it you know that's not up to us

5356.38 --> 5361.84
that's that's part of the bigger plan

5359.199 --> 5366.21
and we have no say in it we can

5361.84 --> 5366.21
speculate about it it's not up to us

5367.8 --> 5373.2390000000005
it's up to the Creator

5370.56 --> 5376.150000000001
well that just sucks for this perfectly

5373.239 --> 5379.0
good joint all right until you find one

5376.15 --> 5382.87
though yeah then that happened to me you

5379.0 --> 5385.15
know it's like like ah crap like yeah

5382.87 --> 5386.739
I'm financially kind of sucks and now I

5385.15 --> 5388.509999999999
have to like do with a very little

5386.739 --> 5390.339999999999
cannabis and then I walk into the shop

5388.51 --> 5395.7390000000005
and there's just this bag laying there

5390.34 --> 5397.81
like okay like Oh exactly and I do

5395.739 --> 5400.0599999999995
realize like ah someone's gonna have

5397.81 --> 5402.969
real shitty time you know having lost oh

5400.06 --> 5404.650000000001
but I'm gonna have a great soul so that

5402.969 --> 5408.66
that's when you say all right so I'm

5404.65 --> 5412.679999999999
rolling one up for them and yeah

5408.66 --> 5415.989
remember their loss oh here's to you

5412.68 --> 5417.7300000000005
thank you for your wishes before you

5415.989 --> 5420.489
said interdimensional what do you mean

5417.73 --> 5425.049999999999
by interdimensional I her dimensional I

5420.489 --> 5429.61
mean through interdimensional is what I

5425.05 --> 5433.63
that's what I do through we we're in the

5429.61 --> 5435.42
3d time linear time bound realm that's

5433.63 --> 5438.76
how our consciousness are attuned

5435.42 --> 5443.35
normally if you're not having semi

5438.76 --> 5447.7300000000005
psychotic situations and yeah you can be

5443.35 --> 5452.14
unstuck from that type of thinking by

5447.73 --> 5455.5599999999995
various means and then you may touch

5452.14 --> 5458.88
upon the higher realms as it were you

5455.56 --> 5458.88
may go through

5459.3 --> 5462.3
yep

5462.69 --> 5467.91
so yeah dimensions it's literally like

5465.57 --> 5471.42
the the conceptual mathematical

5467.91 --> 5474.66
dimensions you have the 3d to read one D

5471.42 --> 5477.09
which done yet so conceptual but yeah

5474.66 --> 5482.849999999999
you do have higher dimensions and they

5477.09 --> 5486.42
are through there right here it's just

5482.85 --> 5489.0
another another depth to it literally

5486.42 --> 5493.05
through radio station like a different

5489.0 --> 5494.85
frequency that's still very material

5493.05 --> 5500.43
bound it's through it's just another

5494.85 --> 5506.04
depth well we got height weight height

5500.43 --> 5510.09
length width and I guess you can call

5506.04 --> 5511.8
the C axis you know through I'll call it

5510.09 --> 5515.13
through but there's more than just one

5511.8 --> 5518.46
through so and and there's other factors

5515.13 --> 5521.67
about it because time gets involved if

5518.46 --> 5524.97
you go through I feel you've heard of

5521.67 --> 5526.65
Schrodinger's cat yeah that's all about

5524.97 --> 5530.04
like quantum theory and all the

5526.65 --> 5532.259999999999
different possible outcomes are like

5530.04 --> 5533.61
endless they're like infinity all the

5532.26 --> 5536.55
different things I could do in the next

5533.61 --> 5537.9
five minutes I could go that I can do

5536.55 --> 5541.05
something like go upstairs

5537.9 --> 5548.099999999999
theoretically never actually write I

5541.05 --> 5551.820000000001
think since all those options exist that

5548.1 --> 5554.34
they do possibly exist in some way shape

5551.82 --> 5556.65
or form I don't like they exist in like

5554.34 --> 5559.56
as a thought as like an idea right in

5556.65 --> 5561.839999999999
the sub dimension that's not the actual

5559.56 --> 5566.1
dimension that's a sub dimension it's

5561.84 --> 5569.04
the the realm of the mind which is also

5566.1 --> 5571.2300000000005
the dark world by the way it's it's one

5569.04 --> 5573.06
of the parts of the dark world it's one

5571.23 --> 5578.4
of my experiences you can actually go

5573.06 --> 5581.09
there and it can be shared it's the

5578.4 --> 5584.549999999999
imagination is something we share in the

5581.09 --> 5587.43
constructive process of the formation of

5584.55 --> 5591.21
it but yeah you can also enter each

5587.43 --> 5594.200000000001
other there by various means it's also

5591.21 --> 5596.02
the same way entities yeah

5594.2 --> 5598.25
approach you through your dreams and

5596.02 --> 5599.17
creepy [ __ ] can happen through your

5598.25 --> 5602.51
dreams

5599.17 --> 5605.42
so yeah that's good but it's a sub

5602.51 --> 5608.45
dimension the mind the imagination is a

5605.42 --> 5611.99
sub dimension it's like the Creator

5608.45 --> 5614.42
imagines creation we imagine our

5611.99 --> 5616.25
imagination it is our creation it's a

5614.42 --> 5619.09
separate realm it really is

5616.25 --> 5621.98
and there's something weird about it

5619.09 --> 5626.12
where do you throw at the mind exists

5621.98 --> 5628.07
what do you think thoughts exists not

5626.12 --> 5634.13
like it's where they physically where

5628.07 --> 5637.67
like over here in the conscious so what

5634.13 --> 5640.93
is your visualization of that like when

5637.67 --> 5644.06
you think of that what do you visualize

5640.93 --> 5647.39
it's there it's in the Akashic library

5644.06 --> 5650.51
knowledge it right thought maybe a

5647.39 --> 5654.59
picture mind is behind us it's it's

5650.51 --> 5657.2
behind us and yeah it becomes part of us

5654.59 --> 5660.92
and then we reflect upon it through our

5657.2 --> 5662.9
imagination and that reflection that is

5660.92 --> 5666.68
the imagination but it's not the thought

5662.9 --> 5672.139999999999
it's not the mind it's only our

5666.68 --> 5678.280000000001
reflection of it sometimes I think of it

5672.14 --> 5685.55
a little a little matric but with less

5678.28 --> 5686.84
computer green numbers but I'm asking

5685.55 --> 5688.9400000000005
actually like if you were to visualize

5686.84 --> 5691.21
it for a movie let's say you're the

5688.94 --> 5696.7699999999995
major yeah find everything like that

5691.21 --> 5700.03
less of the the computer II you know the

5696.77 --> 5704.75
glyphs that they more of the what like

5700.03 --> 5711.29
more of like something like that like a

5704.75 --> 5714.88
smoky light no matrix 3 remember when he

5711.29 --> 5719.32
loses his eyes that's it that's it

5714.88 --> 5726.74
quiet he lost his eyes dude you've never

5719.32 --> 5727.73
before no I've seen really bad so wait

5726.74 --> 5729.71
Arwen

5727.73 --> 5733.94
what are you talking about when he lost

5729.71 --> 5736.64
his sight because of the mushy Agent

5733.94 --> 5739.219999999999
Smith that he was fighting in in that

5736.64 --> 5743.06
[ __ ] right now it's because of the earth

5739.22 --> 5746.4800000000005
one of the guys was taken over by Agent

5743.06 --> 5753.59
Smith basically yeah and then use the

5746.48 --> 5756.169999999999
electric yeah but then he started to see

5753.59 --> 5758.27
again in the matrix way but not through

5756.17 --> 5761.93
code because he wasn't in the matrix but

5758.27 --> 5765.17
he saw through light yes yes like that

5761.93 --> 5768.56
and I got a I got a interject this real

5765.17 --> 5771.59
quick quid it's a that the matrix was a

5768.56 --> 5775.13
documentary and they say that about they

5771.59 --> 5777.35
live right they say that of course they

5775.13 --> 5779.900000000001
live was a documentary but that's just

5777.35 --> 5781.85
the illusion of reality which has

5779.9 --> 5784.009999999999
nothing to do with you

5781.85 --> 5786.320000000001
none of that [ __ ] has anything to do

5784.01 --> 5788.93
with you what's going on in politics or

5786.32 --> 5791.42
other country users was it on the

5788.93 --> 5793.37
name-calling mechanism it was about mind

5791.42 --> 5795.35
control and occultism yeah that's what

5793.37 --> 5799.73
they live was about was very good at it

5795.35 --> 5802.1
right the man Rex is more about yourself

5799.73 --> 5807.919999999999
and you know conception right and it's

5802.1 --> 5810.92
like me on so many points though just at

5807.92 --> 5813.65
the time or after the fact though I got

5810.92 --> 5815.39
asked thanks on but even more so after

5813.65 --> 5818.69
the fact yeah yeah okay

5815.39 --> 5821.150000000001
even more so if I was ladder Jacob's

5818.69 --> 5823.25
Ladder did it for many men he didn't

5821.15 --> 5825.53
know which which timey which life he was

5823.25 --> 5827.78
living like if he died in Vietnam and he

5825.53 --> 5830.179999999999
got to see a dolphin he got to see

5827.78 --> 5833.21
himself living in the future what his

5830.18 --> 5837.26
life could have been two different

5833.21 --> 5839.57
outcomes and then he dies in Vietnam god

5837.26 --> 5842.84
watch that again that's great moving it

5839.57 --> 5844.91
so I wrote that broke goes waitress

5842.84 --> 5847.52
raising oh you mean Jacob's Ladder

5844.91 --> 5851.239
right yeah yeah that's that's another

5847.52 --> 5853.7300000000005
one of those things here adaption but

5851.239 --> 5856.45
that's freaky as hell that movie that

5853.73 --> 5860.03
reminds me a great deal of my own

5856.45 --> 5861.11
darkest dark world experience where they

5860.03 --> 5863.54
basically said like

5861.11 --> 5868.969
yeah at the end of this when you get out

5863.54 --> 5871.3
of it you're gonna die okay I don't

5868.969 --> 5873.71
think we you know what Ram Dass says

5871.3 --> 5877.13
death is like taking off the Knoll a

5873.71 --> 5879.44
tight shoe you don't get you it's the

5877.13 --> 5882.409000000001
context it's the context the guy goes

5879.44 --> 5886.25
through a nightmare cause he kind of

5882.409 --> 5888.44
knows he's actually dead and he's trying

5886.25 --> 5890.719
to hide it from himself and that's the

5888.44 --> 5892.759999999999
whole conundrum yeah he's not letting go

5890.719 --> 5897.08
in other word yeah you're not letting go

5892.76 --> 5898.909000000001
of of material things right so I kind of

5897.08 --> 5903.28
experience the same thing and I was

5898.909 --> 5907.969
always extremely surprised like totally

5903.28 --> 5910.34
besides myself realizing that I was in

5907.969 --> 5914.9890000000005
the normal world again and not dead

5910.34 --> 5918.56
forever okay I don't think we're dead or

5914.989 --> 5920.419999999999
alive I think we doesn't really matter

5918.56 --> 5925.9400000000005
in this context because this was my

5920.42 --> 5927.55
experience and I'm just saying that it's

5925.94 --> 5930.08
not about philosophy it's about

5927.55 --> 5938.409000000001
expectations and I didn't expect to wake

5930.08 --> 5938.409
up from that what happened physically

5938.82 --> 5945.12
I was fed some extremely powerful drugs

5942.33 --> 5951.8099999999995
that I had no idea about by some

5945.12 --> 5953.7
extremely nefarious people yeah and I

5951.81 --> 5959.64
was an idiot and I thought I could

5953.7 --> 5962.19
handle anything what kind of drug like I

5959.64 --> 5963.54
don't know literally because they didn't

5962.19 --> 5966.389999999999
never told me but it's probably

5963.54 --> 5969.45
ayahuasca related that guy had some

5966.39 --> 5971.52
serious tinkering [ __ ] going on he was

5969.45 --> 5975.92
bragging about the several different

5971.52 --> 5979.110000000001
types of effects that he could muster

5975.92 --> 5984.45
which was crazy because at the time he

5979.11 --> 5986.99
was underage that's like it didn't make

5984.45 --> 5992.639999999999
any dams I thought he was just bluffing

5986.99 --> 5994.469999999999
and then it turned out he wasn't well

5992.64 --> 6004.13
did you drink it that you did you smoke

5994.47 --> 6007.240000000001
it no was it no no just a cup goo cacti

6004.13 --> 6011.93
[ __ ] whatever it was I don't know like

6007.24 --> 6014.24
very very little relevance no you don't

6011.93 --> 6016.52
well no I don't want to do that I want

6014.24 --> 6021.95
to do mushrooms again don't haven't

6016.52 --> 6024.26
haven't never potentials Oh dad I mean

6021.95 --> 6024.74
consider those growths really yeah they

6024.26 --> 6026.63
are

6024.74 --> 6029.179999999999
anything with the prescription attached

6026.63 --> 6031.43
to it that's good no that's not drugs

6029.18 --> 6035.75
that's just poison that doesn't mean

6031.43 --> 6037.43
that drugs are not bad but I think you

6035.75 --> 6042.89
did mescaline

6037.43 --> 6046.070000000001
Arwen I don't think so no ok you ever

6042.89 --> 6049.58
have a trapeze but look what I know

6046.07 --> 6052.46
whatever I got wasn't just a standard

6049.58 --> 6055.61
freaking drug the guy like engineered

6052.46 --> 6058.37
that [ __ ] for me he was trying to

6055.61 --> 6061.67
accomplish something and yeah did he

6058.37 --> 6066.41
accomplish anything yeah he screwed up

6061.67 --> 6068.18
my life what really thank you I don't

6066.41 --> 6072.119
think he was trying to screw it

6068.18 --> 6074.249000000001
yeah he was what about he

6072.119 --> 6076.619
made it to me that that is exactly what

6074.249 --> 6080.309
he was trying to do among other things

6076.619 --> 6082.53
among other things that was only the end

6080.309 --> 6084.3
result he was aiming for because there

6082.53 --> 6086.518999999999
were other processes involved as well

6084.3 --> 6087.59
gathered in dimensional interdimensional

6086.519 --> 6092.820000000001
[ __ ]

6087.59 --> 6095.729
how about Bey's that I beat him up no no

6092.82 --> 6098.07
that can't do that with a guy like that

6095.729 --> 6103.169
because you are only truly kill you if

6098.07 --> 6106.469
you do that how about this years later

6103.169 --> 6109.409
thinking back on it did it actually

6106.469 --> 6112.159
bring some kind of positive realization

6109.409 --> 6115.11
to your life see what I mean

6112.159 --> 6117.598999999999
are you better for it you're like wow I

6115.11 --> 6119.308999999999
went through that now I kind of

6117.599 --> 6121.1990000000005
understand it bla bla bla

6119.309 --> 6124.289
whatever well I did get to see a lot of

6121.199 --> 6128.009999999999
amazing stuff and witnessed absolute or

6124.289 --> 6131.099
beyond my imagination and learn how

6128.01 --> 6134.849
messed up this world really is into the

6131.099 --> 6138.689
depths and also the nature of glory so

6134.849 --> 6141.269
yeah I got a lot of knowledge out of it

6138.689 --> 6142.860000000001
like practical wisdom knowledge that's

6141.269 --> 6144.929
what happens when you experience 80

6142.86 --> 6146.848999999999
freaking years you know you get wisdom

6144.929 --> 6149.459
what do you like it or not it just takes

6146.849 --> 6152.729
a while for your body to freaking adapt

6149.459 --> 6156.148999999999
to that [ __ ] right yeah it's not an

6152.729 --> 6158.729
instant but it also freakin screwed me

6156.149 --> 6161.479
up in a way that I have become

6158.729 --> 6169.429
completely disconcerted with society

6161.479 --> 6172.649
like I being any more because of it okay

6169.429 --> 6175.139
that's good do you wanna be one of those

6172.649 --> 6178.110000000001
really great I'm a 40 years old I've

6175.139 --> 6181.979
never had an actual job of any kind

6178.11 --> 6184.768999999999
really do you want to be one of those

6181.979 --> 6189.059
normal people no and that's the problem

6184.769 --> 6192.209
and they're you well cuz now I'm stuck

6189.059 --> 6195.659000000001
I'm a freakin hermit and nobody gets why

6192.209 --> 6199.219
they just think I'm freaking insane well

6195.659 --> 6204.239
you don't have to be a hermit oh really

6199.219 --> 6206.07
not anymore not after realizing no no

6204.239 --> 6208.259999999999
none of maybe eating that

6206.07 --> 6210.719
if you could just say you know what I

6208.26 --> 6213.4800000000005
think it to be a hermit state I'm gonna

6210.719 --> 6218.849
go out and do [ __ ] a holy hermit

6213.48 --> 6223.169999999999
nonsense I do my show and I am gonna do

6218.849 --> 6226.889
some do stuff and especially money now

6223.17 --> 6229.019
actually starting to finally get some

6226.889 --> 6231.63
momentum like if I'm lucky enough that

6229.019 --> 6237.119000000001
it'll actually be allowed for me to do

6231.63 --> 6244.59
stuff out there and okay let me freaking

6237.119 --> 6247.17
finish something

6244.59 --> 6249.809
don't interrupt me wanna do I'm I was

6247.17 --> 6251.369
trying to answer exactly where you're

6249.809 --> 6254.309
saying but go ahead

6251.369 --> 6257.13
I hate it when people do that okay but

6254.309 --> 6260.01
I'm not everybody I'm not par with this

6257.13 --> 6263.329
is different on r1 I'm a shaman for

6260.01 --> 6271.820000000001
[ __ ] sake zhu-li for [ __ ] sake oh

6263.329 --> 6275.009999999999
okay your colleagues okay go hang it is

6271.82 --> 6277.44
that I just realized that if none of

6275.01 --> 6280.59
this had happened I would have a pretty

6277.44 --> 6283.98
decent normal life it would be primitive

6280.59 --> 6285.42
I would be stupid but I would be

6283.98 --> 6289.138999999999
relatively bliss

6285.42 --> 6291.329
I would absolutely have children and I

6289.139 --> 6294.0
wouldn't be concerned about so much and

6291.329 --> 6295.889
I would probably die because of my own

6294.0 --> 6297.869
ignorance at some point because that is

6295.889 --> 6300.900000000001
what this world does with ignorant

6297.869 --> 6303.449
people maybe vaccines maybe some

6300.9 --> 6304.768999999999
pharmaceutical [ __ ] that I would start

6303.449 --> 6306.598999999999
taking for no good reason

6304.769 --> 6309.719
but the alternative is is that I know

6306.599 --> 6313.139
all this [ __ ] and basically feel

6309.719 --> 6315.42
isolated and can't really not really

6313.139 --> 6318.96
engage fully because I just see too much

6315.42 --> 6321.329
and it's not something that generally

6318.96 --> 6325.11
makes you happy it does have its rewards

6321.329 --> 6327.42
but it sucks also and you feel so

6325.11 --> 6331.289
contrasting with everyone and everything

6327.42 --> 6334.07
around you it's not pleasant feeling so

6331.289 --> 6337.759999999999
contrasting

6334.07 --> 6341.0
so now I'm done

6337.76 --> 6341.0
sorry for that

6341.989 --> 6353.94
it's alright or what but yeah I'm doing

6350.01 --> 6356.55
stuff I'm skip I'm saying it I look at

6353.94 --> 6358.44
it from an interdimensional perspective

6356.55 --> 6361.41
I look at it from the way I was

6358.44 --> 6364.379999999999
literally looking at it in my experience

6361.41 --> 6366.42
twenty years ago like I'm supposed to be

6364.38 --> 6369.78
doing something I don't understand it

6366.42 --> 6372.27
completely but I'm supposed to be doing

6369.78 --> 6376.08
stuff and it's really important for some

6372.27 --> 6378.84
reason or it appears to be to me or to

6376.08 --> 6381.45
my interdimensional self who was doing

6378.84 --> 6383.7300000000005
stuff trying to get involved in the

6381.45 --> 6386.46
bigger picture trying to get some kind

6383.73 --> 6389.489
of human sensible outcome trying to

6386.46 --> 6392.79
teach a lesson to all of humanity it is

6389.489 --> 6394.5
very important and very very hard to

6392.79 --> 6396.96
learn because people don't want to learn

6394.5 --> 6401.25
because knowledge is more of a burden

6396.96 --> 6405.41
than a useful tool to most and even

6401.25 --> 6405.41
those that are in power just know this

6405.83 --> 6411.96
and it sounds all very weird you're in

6411.51 --> 6417.51
power

6411.96 --> 6422.0
Arwen what you're in power in the house

6417.51 --> 6424.71
you know what sense you control yourself

6422.0 --> 6427.14
alright I'm working a sport you know you

6424.71 --> 6429.72
got your health man and that's not

6427.14 --> 6432.17
something to take for granted I know I

6429.72 --> 6434.37
wear for it all my life

6432.17 --> 6436.2
yeah I'm not saying you taking it for

6434.37 --> 6439.23
granted I'm just reminding reminding

6436.2 --> 6441.09
myself you ace chocolate and everyone

6439.23 --> 6441.989
listening don't take your help for

6441.09 --> 6443.16
granted Babs

6441.989 --> 6445.95
give you all the money in the world

6443.16 --> 6448.8
that's not gonna make you damn bit happy

6445.95 --> 6452.33
and I know this yeah but now at the same

6448.8 --> 6456.33
time I have to defend it with my life

6452.33 --> 6458.64
depend on your help yeah yeah we all do

6456.33 --> 6462.48
yeah but it's and the attacks are

6458.64 --> 6463.29
increasing and it's going so so I feel

6462.48 --> 6467.15
the littering

6463.29 --> 6469.59
sometimes like I'm this self discovered

6467.15 --> 6472.259999999999
sounds kind of grandiose but like a

6469.59 --> 6475.52
paladin or a knight of God that is now

6472.26 --> 6479.780000000001
imbued with this power of truth the

6475.52 --> 6483.27
principles the truth justice honesty

6479.78 --> 6485.969999999999
logos all that but at the same time

6483.27 --> 6488.160000000001
everything around turns out to be quite

6485.97 --> 6494.070000000001
the contrast and is just getting dragged

6488.16 --> 6496.97
along in under cover of a human world

6494.07 --> 6500.61
that's actually basically a demon pit or

6496.97 --> 6502.95
being dragged to their doom and I have

6500.61 --> 6505.41
to constantly defend every element

6502.95 --> 6507.36
inside of me and my principles against

6505.41 --> 6510.24
that because all these people and all

6507.36 --> 6514.29
these things are designated designed to

6510.24 --> 6516.3
tear that down and they the people that

6514.29 --> 6522.14
are doing it literally don't even

6516.3 --> 6524.43
consciously realize it it's insane I

6522.14 --> 6527.9400000000005
just gotta say goddess which Bella

6524.43 --> 6532.17
literally said exactly what I was just

6527.94 --> 6534.509999999999
about to say you know truth once the I

6532.17 --> 6546.03
had to hang out earlier this morning and

6534.51 --> 6548.34
I had in the description truth it was as

6546.03 --> 6552.3
soon as you can what you can prove what

6548.34 --> 6556.02
you can prove so [ __ ] yeah there was

6552.3 --> 6559.62
that and I'm gonna see it right as soon

6556.02 --> 6564.09
as this page opens up so information

6559.62 --> 6566.64
it's about intention it was here you go

6564.09 --> 6569.88
awakening begins when a man realizes

6566.64 --> 6572.13
that he is going nowhere and does not

6569.88 --> 6575.21
know where he's going it's when

6572.13 --> 6580.1900000000005
awakening begins you want liberation

6575.21 --> 6583.62
serve God you want freedom feed people

6580.19 --> 6585.719999999999
truth exists only until you open your

6583.62 --> 6587.849999999999
mouth up to tell someone about it in

6585.72 --> 6591.27
this moment you've reduced it to word

6587.85 --> 6595.59
your word against his

6591.27 --> 6598.35
so basically the truth is really the

6595.59 --> 6601.860000000001
truth has no form you know words are

6598.35 --> 6604.47
just birds truth

6601.86 --> 6606.03
its internal yeah you can only pizzette

6604.47 --> 6609.84
you can only own your own truth

6606.03 --> 6612.57
it can't be communicated [ __ ] like I

6609.84 --> 6615.18
can't know you let's say that's the

6612.57 --> 6617.849999999999
label of information truth or not truth

6615.18 --> 6620.490000000001
no truth is an intention it's an intent

6617.85 --> 6624.42
the truth is

6620.49 --> 6627.599999999999
I'm acting in accordance to what you

6624.42 --> 6630.15
know to be true whether it be right or

6627.6 --> 6634.320000000001
wrong that's another matter

6630.15 --> 6637.98
the truth is the intent that you intend

6634.32 --> 6640.889999999999
to tell it and not a lie not to cover it

6637.98 --> 6644.5199999999995
not to hide it not to go the phoenicians

6640.89 --> 6648.150000000001
wave but to really direct and truthful

6644.52 --> 6650.25
that is truth the intent is much more

6648.15 --> 6652.349999999999
important than the actual content of

6650.25 --> 6656.16
some information that you're dealing

6652.35 --> 6659.31
with much more so let's break it down

6656.16 --> 6666.93
then give me your definition of of what

6659.31 --> 6674.09
truth is the truth is an intent yes and

6666.93 --> 6674.09
is an intent an intent would be a

6674.42 --> 6684.66
preconceived reason for doing something

6678.47 --> 6689.31
yes mine my intent was to learn how to

6684.66 --> 6693.8099999999995
play drums right well that's something

6689.31 --> 6697.71
else yes my education related it's to be

6693.81 --> 6700.830000000001
truthful to speak the truth or

6697.71 --> 6703.92
communicate the truth as you know it do

6700.83 --> 6706.83
you know the truth on would you say that

6703.92 --> 6708.36
you have been a good idea first of all

6706.83 --> 6711.75
we got to pick something that we're

6708.36 --> 6713.3099999999995
being truthful like you know your

6711.75 --> 6714.63
reality right you know when you're full

6713.31 --> 6716.700000000001
of [ __ ] you know when you're telling

6714.63 --> 6717.900000000001
lies I mean you know when you're telling

6716.7 --> 6719.94
lies you know when you're telling the

6717.9 --> 6724.0599999999995
truth right

6719.94 --> 6725.919999999999
so that's that's the truth that is for

6724.06 --> 6727.240000000001
its as far as you're concerned that's

6725.92 --> 6730.27
the truth that's right

6727.24 --> 6733.21
the truth as you know it I couldn't

6730.27 --> 6736.6
understand that because I have my own

6733.21 --> 6740.11
truth which involves me that's why I

6736.6 --> 6742.42
think we all have a certain spot in our

6740.11 --> 6745.599999999999
psyche it's our own stamp of approval

6742.42 --> 6747.64
because at the end of the day we decide

6745.6 --> 6749.59
what's real what's true what's not true

6747.64 --> 6751.780000000001
even if it's two plus two equals five

6749.59 --> 6754.24
those are people who if that's the case

6751.78 --> 6756.13
then someone's lying to themselves but

6754.24 --> 6759.25
when it comes down to like what matters

6756.13 --> 6766.75
you know Ari am i a good person am i a

6759.25 --> 6770.41
piece of [ __ ] am I am I am the depraved

6766.75 --> 6773.89
soul am i use in my no help to society

6770.41 --> 6777.67
do I do nothing but drag people down and

6773.89 --> 6779.5
then there's you know you know am I am i

6777.67 --> 6782.47
adding to the am i bringing something

6779.5 --> 6784.39
worthy to the table am i helping people

6782.47 --> 6785.62
which really not really a realization

6784.39 --> 6788.1
that's just something that happened

6785.62 --> 6790.599999999999
that's but that's something else that's

6788.1 --> 6795.0
involved but that's not the truth the

6790.6 --> 6798.1900000000005
truth is just the intent of saying it as

6795.0 --> 6801.85
you consciously know it to be true

6798.19 --> 6806.339999999999
or to bring out the story to create a

6801.85 --> 6811.63
narrative or to create a suggestion that

6806.34 --> 6814.24
may be not truthful or may evade it or

6811.63 --> 6816.36
bypass it or manipulate it in any other

6814.24 --> 6816.36
way

6820.32 --> 6830.44
how would you define honesty that's what

6826.06 --> 6833.38
I'm feeling that's why I don't like the

6830.44 --> 6835.69
truth is like I think it's just the

6833.38 --> 6839.85
wrong word where honesty is so much more

6835.69 --> 6842.83
passion to it you know MSI's the social

6839.85 --> 6845.83
interaction while truth right is a key

6842.83 --> 6848.26
word it is a principle it is more than

6845.83 --> 6852.3099999999995
just a social interaction it is a part

6848.26 --> 6853.58
of logos it's if it's the top part by

6852.31 --> 6859.910000000001
the way you've mentioned that

6853.58 --> 6864.0199999999995
clear me up on that logos is it is the

6859.91 --> 6868.07
structure laid out for all of creation

6864.02 --> 6870.56
by the Creator as in how we were

6868.07 --> 6874.429999999999
designed to do things what is the right

6870.56 --> 6876.2300000000005
way the plan yeah okay no but not just

6874.43 --> 6879.08
the plan because that is how God

6876.23 --> 6883.94
controls things but it is the pay the

6879.08 --> 6887.44
path laid out how to do things right are

6883.94 --> 6891.32
you not the creator and the created no

6887.44 --> 6894.5599999999995
you're not no the Creator is outside of

6891.32 --> 6897.139999999999
the physical realm but we are indeed in

6894.56 --> 6899.870000000001
its reflections creators ourselves of

6897.14 --> 6902.21
our mind and of the matter around us but

6899.87 --> 6904.25
that does not make us be creator no

6902.21 --> 6908.45
neither does that make us the one who

6904.25 --> 6912.74
made the pattern and the plan or logos

6908.45 --> 6915.98
no no right to us is up to us to take it

6912.74 --> 6919.58
or to evade from it and become freakin

6915.98 --> 6920.33
miserable we do not follow logos we will

6919.58 --> 6924.05
be punished

6920.33 --> 6926.33
by nature itself from within or

6924.05 --> 6929.93
themselves that's why I think we judge

6926.33 --> 6931.16
ourselves in the end you know we decide

6929.93 --> 6933.25
whether or not we're allowed to have

6931.16 --> 6935.87
that piece of cake in the refrigerator

6933.25 --> 6937.85
you know just a metaphor for whether or

6935.87 --> 6939.71
not we allow ourselves to go to the

6937.85 --> 6942.92
other side because we know in the end

6939.71 --> 6946.94
you know you know in the end whether or

6942.92 --> 6948.62
not you're worthy of something good you

6946.94 --> 6950.389999999999
know if you're worthy of a child's love

6955.64 --> 6959.06
guilt

6956.53 --> 6962.45
you know sometimes like I've seen videos

6959.06 --> 6965.21

7066.12 --> 7071.26
looking at something you're in clear

7068.65 --> 7073.239
look outside like when I started the

7131.36 --> 7138.259999999999
you can do your your night our show when

7133.88 --> 7139.639
they are when how or when how could I

7138.26 --> 7141.26
send wait oh man

7139.639 --> 7144.079
hold on hold on hold on hold on I got

7141.26 --> 7146.030000000001
the answer I got the answer and I do

7144.079 --> 7147.92
this all the time when I stream so I'll

7146.03 --> 7151.19
start a stream up on my computer

7147.92 --> 7155.09
but then I'll join as a guest on my

7151.19 --> 7157.28
phone and there you go so now you have

7155.09 --> 7159.9800000000005
your phone it's got a camera on and

7157.28 --> 7162.018999999999
whatnot and you can be outside excellent

7159.98 --> 7164.718999999999
yeah BAM it's the one of them though I

7162.019 --> 7169.849
don't have a phone not one with the

7164.719 --> 7171.559
camera yet I don't dance the whole thing

7169.849 --> 7175.7300000000005
that is rotary like I don't I don't

7171.559 --> 7178.639
really plan to have one but I might have

7175.73 --> 7183.53
might have take a phone specifically and

7178.639 --> 7186.32
exclusively just to do camera work with

7183.53 --> 7191.389
it but I don't actually an interesting

7186.32 --> 7195.199
idea is I like that set up the Hangout

7191.389 --> 7200.269
and then join it on a phone ship that

7195.199 --> 7203.03
Nokia n900 Oh get it there this little

7200.269 --> 7204.559
guy right here man cost $5 at a flea

7203.03 --> 7206.389
market came with the battery and

7204.559 --> 7208.67
everything and the best thing about

7206.389 --> 7211.179
these Canon cameras the UH like the

7208.67 --> 7216.71
elves they allow for macro photography

7211.179 --> 7217.7300000000005
which is like extreme close-up dude the

7216.71 --> 7221.929
coolest [ __ ] man

7217.73 --> 7224.598999999999
honey what that's that's how I got into

7221.929 --> 7228.65
photography like literally and I think

7224.599 --> 7230.659000000001
it was 2001 no with elf it was the first

7228.65 --> 7233.9
camera a friend of mine had one and it

7230.659 --> 7235.759999999999
it had manual settings so we'd go out at

7233.9 --> 7238.759999999999
night that's actually how I found out

7235.76 --> 7240.530000000001
what Polaris was back in the day cuz no

7238.76 --> 7242.9890000000005
one ever teaches you what the [ __ ]

7240.53 --> 7244.909
Polaris is and by the way all these flat

7242.989 --> 7247.039
earthers talking about Polaris and this

7244.909 --> 7248.0599999999995

7247.039 --> 7249.889999999999
it's a normal

7248.06 --> 7252.620000000001

here at all

7725.519 --> 7732.570000000001
I don't hear any of that [ __ ] it's like

7729.389 --> 7735.84
see New Jersey New Jersey is like it's

7732.57 --> 7737.19
like a half way accent because people in

7735.84 --> 7739.889
New Jersey are like living in the shadow

7737.19 --> 7741.839999999999
of New York which is a bad situation cuz

7739.889 --> 7743.13
they're confused they don't know if they

7741.84 --> 7745.32
want to they don't want to go all the

7743.13 --> 7749.13
way which would be living in the real

7745.32 --> 7750.808999999999
deal Manhattan sort of the real deal so

7749.13 --> 7754.53
they live in New Jersey which is close

7750.809 --> 7757.079000000001
to its close to the action in proximity

7754.53 --> 7760.469
to the action I could I couldn't live in

7757.079 --> 7762.75
that and man it worked out there for

7760.469 --> 7766.409
enough years I couldn't live out there I

7762.75 --> 7768.21
don't know how people do that it's it

7766.409 --> 7769.888999999999
basically I'd spoke to someone about

7768.21 --> 7772.53
that wasn't how do you do it and he's

7769.889 --> 7775.079
like I had that my fingertips something

7772.53 --> 7777.119
new for the rest of my life every day if

7775.079 --> 7778.86
I want a new restaurant I have it

7777.119 --> 7782.098999999999
tomorrow yeah

7778.86 --> 7784.38
man you can't do everything it gets old

7782.099 --> 7787.38
though I used to be a bike messenger in

7784.38 --> 7792.42
Manhattan and I was always a foot master

7787.38 --> 7794.309
oh yeah yeah it's you know I feel safer

7792.42 --> 7796.4400000000005
riding a bike in Manhattan than I do in

7794.309 --> 7799.26
the streets of New Jersey because their

7796.44 --> 7801.48
people are conscientious of like bike

7799.26 --> 7804.0
bicycle ears and there's no better way

7801.48 --> 7808.199
to see Manhattan then for my bike

7804.0 --> 7810.09
I got door once I would do I would do

7808.199 --> 7812.009999999999
the city bike [ __ ] every once in a while

7810.09 --> 7815.01
but I never actually got my own bike to

7812.01 --> 7819.360000000001
do the thing cuz they they would send me

7815.01 --> 7821.309
a lot on the train and should so that's

7819.36 --> 7825.268999999999
it's great exercise man I was in the

7821.309 --> 7827.25
best shape I've seen it yeah and I was

7825.269 --> 7830.309
opposite he's like to walk all over the

7827.25 --> 7832.07
place I mean I would literally walk

7830.309 --> 7834.45
uptown down

7832.07 --> 7836.849999999999
you know if I didn't feel like getting

7834.45 --> 7839.51
on the train and depending on the times

7836.85 --> 7842.280000000001
cuz you know the rush-hour out there so

7839.51 --> 7844.9800000000005
sometimes I'm just like no I'm not doing

7842.28 --> 7846.63
the Train I would get you know it's cool

7844.98 --> 7848.04
there's a lot of videos on YouTube now

7846.63 --> 7851.9400000000005
they're doing some interesting stuff

7848.04 --> 7854.07
like people are taking their GoPros so I

7851.94 --> 7857.73
guess like GoPro eight because videos

7854.07 --> 7859.83
really really clean and they're they're

7857.73 --> 7861.929999999999
basically filming themselves walking

7859.83 --> 7865.05
through a town walking through New York

7861.93 --> 7868.740000000001
walking through Tokyo walking anywhere

7865.05 --> 7872.31
and the perspective is walking down the

7868.74 --> 7875.969999999999
street in Manhattan or experience New

7872.31 --> 7877.92
York on rush hour someone somewhere

7875.97 --> 7883.71
wants to have that experience to the

7877.92 --> 7885.65
best of their ability via VR yeah you

7883.71 --> 7888.6
and I would get a VR system like that

7885.65 --> 7893.4
oculus rift have you guys tried that oh

7888.6 --> 7905.1900000000005
I know one of my old friends has one of

7893.4 --> 7913.139999999999
those things actually got lost in many

7905.19 --> 7916.74
ways yeah went pretty much on the yeah I

7913.14 --> 7924.650000000001
can see how people could could get lost

7916.74 --> 7928.0199999999995
into that type of thing step to take

7924.65 --> 7930.629999999999
it's also lost in soy and lost in some

7928.02 --> 7933.240000000001
other stuff by the way Thank You Daniel

7930.63 --> 7935.55
field for the super chat donation for

7933.24 --> 7942.75
the grocery it's very nice but I can't

7935.55 --> 7945.27
actually get to them for now going on

7942.75 --> 7947.58
about the bladder is why when Bob and

7945.27 --> 7949.92
Jaron blew the whole thing up you know

7947.58 --> 7952.11
what do people give up [ __ ] man

7949.92 --> 7954.36
like just let the [ __ ] earth be flat

7952.11 --> 7956.759999999999
for these four for us what do you care

7954.36 --> 7959.94
what the hell do you care it's always my

7956.76 --> 7962.64
question like what you care I mean you

7959.94 --> 7964.23
gotta be a so special user because it's

7962.64 --> 7967.35
breaking their dream that

7964.23 --> 7969.239
why so why why are you spending the time

7967.35 --> 7972.06
somewhere where your dream is breaking

7969.239 --> 7975.12
we gotta go good to go watch sports

7972.06 --> 7977.22
listen I don't understand because in the

7975.12 --> 7981.989
back of their mind they still know it's

7977.22 --> 7983.7300000000005
out there oh and it's itching at them so

7981.989 --> 7988.83
then that means maybe there's something

7983.73 --> 7991.86
wrong that's exactly what it means

7988.83 --> 7993.9
that's why they do it they can bunk our

7991.86 --> 7995.58
videos and then secretly hop over to

7993.9 --> 7998.4
Google be like let me just take a few

7995.58 --> 8002.09
pictures you know is the earth round or

7998.4 --> 8004.489
like you know curvature photos of the

8002.09 --> 8007.22
earth just just to make sure you know of

8004.489 --> 8011.179999999999
course the earth is round but you know

8007.22 --> 8016.06
can't hurt to just check right ah okay

8011.18 --> 8018.530000000001
yes like interesting interesting

8016.06 --> 8022.370000000001
anybody secure in their place in the

8018.53 --> 8025.28
world would have no we're not giving two

8022.37 --> 8028.34
shits about us talking about lasting at

8025.28 --> 8033.38
it and would wouldn't care they promote

8028.34 --> 8037.12
it here you are they promote it that's

8033.38 --> 8040.79
why the it's interesting what it draws

8037.12 --> 8042.83
you know it's either that or they're

8040.79 --> 8043.76
just getting really upset that we're not

8042.83 --> 8047.3
going anywhere

8043.76 --> 8049.46
and the actus the actual office evil

8047.3 --> 8053.9800000000005
what they want is happening they want

8049.46 --> 8056.75
this to go away and it's not our people

8053.98 --> 8058.099999999999
they don't hate flattered or they don't

8056.75 --> 8060.77
even know what they hate but they see

8058.1 --> 8062.6900000000005
faces and they see things they see the

8060.77 --> 8065.2390000000005
way people address they see certain

8062.69 --> 8067.099999999999
mannerisms they see types of people that

8065.239 --> 8071.719999999999
they don't like whether they're white

8067.1 --> 8074.93
black Asian any nationality they just

8071.72 --> 8078.22
they're sociopaths and they like having

8074.93 --> 8081.8
reasons to support their own hatred well

8078.22 --> 8083.4800000000005
that's I think is there not a sociopath

8081.8 --> 8087.110000000001
that's not why they do it they're just

8083.48 --> 8089.509999999999
in the dream and they don't want to be

8087.11 --> 8094.94
disturbed from it yeah that's I think

8089.51 --> 8097.9400000000005
that's know they are dwelling yes I

8094.94 --> 8102.259999999999
think see your freedom

8097.94 --> 8105.409
that they don't have because they still

8102.26 --> 8108.05
have to some for some reason something

8105.409 --> 8110.87
is keeping them holding on to this ball

8108.05 --> 8115.159000000001
this fear that they believe they live on

8110.87 --> 8119.51
and they see us just let that go and I

8115.159 --> 8122.929
think that bothers them really because

8119.51 --> 8125.21
they they're still tied to that ball you

8122.929 --> 8126.86
know and some of us yes some of us you

8125.21 --> 8128.9
know think it's a dong some of this

8126.86 --> 8131.21
infinite plane whatever you know

8128.9 --> 8136.07
whatever it is we're not attached to

8131.21 --> 8140.179
this spinning water ball anymore right

8136.07 --> 8142.849999999999
they're mad at that a little bit it's

8140.179 --> 8145.58
it's not look it went it the real

8142.85 --> 8147.29
psychological cornerstone of it and why

8145.58 --> 8148.75
they do what they do is not even about

8147.29 --> 8152.69
the ball or the flat earth

8148.75 --> 8158.06
it's about society accepting the ball

8152.69 --> 8160.3099999999995
and we rejecting society in that sense

8158.06 --> 8161.929
and that is their big problem is that

8160.31 --> 8164.4400000000005
all these things that they rely upon

8161.929 --> 8169.0
that they have a certain look upon

8164.44 --> 8171.469
co-exist with the acceptance of the ball

8169.0 --> 8173.87
that is where it really lies it's not

8171.469 --> 8176.0
even about what is the actual shape no

8173.87 --> 8179.12
it is about the society that is

8176.0 --> 8183.77
accepting it and then being part of that

8179.12 --> 8187.28
society and being comfortable with that

8183.77 --> 8191.3
society accepting it and then when we do

8187.28 --> 8193.789999999999
not accept it then that crosses there

8191.3 --> 8197.389000000001
getting that acceptance and I get that

8193.79 --> 8201.139000000001
but again if you are completely and

8197.389 --> 8204.469
believe 100% believe that either pillar

8201.139 --> 8207.859999999999
on a spinning ball why would this topic

8204.469 --> 8211.188999999998
bother you you know why wouldn't it just

8207.86 --> 8214.25
be another silly stupid topic that you

8211.189 --> 8219.349
don't pay attention to the weak because

8214.25 --> 8221.599
it lets off with everything because yeah

8219.349 --> 8224.51
it's all a giant pile of narratives and

8221.599 --> 8226.729
if a narrative may be delusional or

8224.51 --> 8230.79
wrong or whatever as long as it can fit

8226.729 --> 8233.551
on top of the baseline Society

8230.79 --> 8235.68
the way of thinking and how everything

8233.551 --> 8237.6
is structure eyes and the stable

8235.68 --> 8240.81
foundation you can trust upon you can

8237.6 --> 8241.91
rely upon in some way that is what it's

8240.81 --> 8246.029999999999
really about

8241.91 --> 8251.39
and I'll add earthers look we we

8246.03 --> 8254.131000000001
parallel construct everything everything

8251.39 --> 8256.5
the context of Flat Earth brings all

8254.131 --> 8260.16
these stories that are out there into

8256.5 --> 8264.39
another perspective aside construction

8260.16 --> 8267.36
and that that's their main problem so

8264.39 --> 8273.961
you can't fit it inside of that what

8267.36 --> 8279.12
they do know like you were talking about

8273.961 --> 8283.56
why would these people be so accepted

8279.12 --> 8285.69
believe in the globe like completely and

8283.56 --> 8289.439999999999
they think this is ridiculous like why

8285.69 --> 8292.74
why would they care I don't like just

8289.44 --> 8298.171
like we don't care about you know little

8292.74 --> 8302.131
kids talking about fantasies or unicorns

8298.171 --> 8304.23
or whatever about that ghosts well the

8302.131 --> 8306.301
thing is saying you're right you're real

8304.23 --> 8310.14
right like normal people

8306.301 --> 8312.06
maybe normal people that believe we live

8310.14 --> 8315.840999999999
on a globe they don't care and they're

8312.06 --> 8319.14
not here bothering us there's something

8315.841 --> 8321.48
weird about the people that are here

8319.14 --> 8324.48
they watch all the shows that are Flat

8321.48 --> 8326.131
Earth related yet they claim they they

8324.48 --> 8330.091
believe in the globe and that Flat Earth

8326.131 --> 8334.529999999999
has no evidence that is weird I was

8330.091 --> 8336.81
actually really really weird it's it's

8334.53 --> 8339.78
beyond pletely agree I asked this

8336.81 --> 8340.74
question always no no no no I don't

8339.78 --> 8344.37
think it's that weird it's just

8340.74 --> 8348.091
religious it's a religious behavior they

8344.37 --> 8351.12
get attention for what if they're

8348.091 --> 8354.75
curious about it if you know maybe they

8351.12 --> 8358.230000000001
they have some some direction towards

8354.75 --> 8361.29
just you know scientific topics right

8358.23 --> 8364.08
fine okay great but if this is a topic

8361.29 --> 8367.5
that triggers you why are you being

8364.08 --> 8370.65
triggered by if you completely believe

8367.5 --> 8373.95
it why does it trigger enough to bring

8370.65 --> 8377.19
you back again and again to listen to

8373.95 --> 8380.58
people that you leave or disagree with

8377.19 --> 8385.139000000001
that you will insult well you're you're

8380.58 --> 8387.57
here in our hangout listening to it like

8385.139 --> 8389.759999999998
I don't get that because this very

8387.57 --> 8392.91
because they because they're fascinated

8389.76 --> 8397.74
by what they can sense on the surface

8392.91 --> 8401.76
look we're in another universe mentally

8397.74 --> 8405.03
to them in a place where they they're

8401.76 --> 8407.79
not stride but yeah it's like oh these

8405.03 --> 8410.43
guys are going to another realm or to

8407.79 --> 8412.561000000002
another continent compare this like

8410.43 --> 8414.300000000001
they're going there we've been weird I'm

8412.561 --> 8415.59
gonna go there we we're here safe

8414.3 --> 8419.4
everything is all right

8415.59 --> 8421.59
but yeah what what did they see actually

8419.4 --> 8423.811
out there you know so they're like

8421.59 --> 8428.0
studying us in the sense for like okay

8423.811 --> 8430.949999999999
these people are outside of our our

8428.0 --> 8433.08
conceptualization of things but what are

8430.95 --> 8434.640000000001
they doing what are they finding what

8433.08 --> 8436.5
are they stumbling upon it's very

8434.64 --> 8439.619999999999
fascinating because they're seeing

8436.5 --> 8443.42
things that they themselves from their

8439.62 --> 8451.140000000001
perspective don't get to engage with and

8443.42 --> 8456.3
that's interesting so I guess I always

8451.14 --> 8459.359999999999
think it's it's a subconscious almost

8456.3 --> 8463.289999999999
like a they they know subconsciously

8459.36 --> 8467.67
somehow that what they're hearing is

8463.29 --> 8469.42
right and that programming has to fight

8467.67 --> 8471.699
it

8469.42 --> 8473.83
but I mean right go on the home that I

8471.699 --> 8476.800000000001
think that can keep bringing them back

8473.83 --> 8478.689
like why do they get triggered so badly

8476.8 --> 8481.06
hearing that the earth might be fire is

8478.689 --> 8482.649
it because they've been or we've all

8481.06 --> 8485.5
been indoctrinated into this

8482.649 --> 8488.439
heliocentric model for all our lives or

8485.5 --> 8491.92
is it because somehow subconsciously

8488.439 --> 8496.210000000001
they know that there's something to this

8491.92 --> 8499.149
and that their subconscious won't that

8496.21 --> 8501.849999999999
it's feeding into their conscious and

8499.149 --> 8504.55
they don't know what ism what it is is

8501.85 --> 8508.33
they know there is something wrong about

8504.55 --> 8510.759999999998
what they believe in but right they not

8508.33 --> 8514.42
they're not ready to actually embrace

8510.76 --> 8517.029
what that means and then they get

8514.42 --> 8519.79
triggered at all he tried authors who

8517.029 --> 8522.159
are pointing all the things that are

8519.79 --> 8527.890000000001
wrong out to them and they don't want to

8522.159 --> 8529.979
hear it I mean just it's it's the

8527.89 --> 8532.689
vitriol of it that I don't get like

8529.979 --> 8536.38
somebody that will come into a father of

8532.689 --> 8538.42
chatting oh you guys are all it is so

8536.38 --> 8540.96
high schoolers what's the attention

8538.42 --> 8543.31
these guys get when they come into a

8540.96 --> 8544.869999999999
situation of room where people are

8543.31 --> 8547.539999999999
talking about a certain subject matter

8544.87 --> 8548.739000000001
to come in as the contrarian they're

8547.54 --> 8551.649000000001
gonna get all the attention

8548.739 --> 8553.21
not only that they want to look into

8551.649 --> 8555.278999999999
this subject matter but they don't have

8553.21 --> 8556.539999999999
the balls to do it themselves because

8555.279 --> 8559.689
they're not in they're not the type of

8556.54 --> 8563.470000000001
person that has the courage to actually

8559.689 --> 8565.6
look into new things and go out of their

8563.47 --> 8568.84
comfort zone so they disguise themselves

8565.6 --> 8571.81
as someone who believes in the ball or

8568.84 --> 8574.029
whatever like nobody ever believes in a

8571.81 --> 8576.1
ball you know no one ever did before and

8574.029 --> 8578.08
even now no one no one does

8576.1 --> 8580.659
all right it just in contrast to that

8578.08 --> 8583.21
right like it's the best Super Bowl

8580.659 --> 8586.21
matchup you know you got codes it's a

8583.21 --> 8588.58
coca-cola war black versus white oh I

8586.21 --> 8591.188999999998
get that flat verse round people love a

8588.58 --> 8593.319
good fight and that's what it is they

8591.189 --> 8596.069
want to keep updated on it and it's just

8593.319 --> 8598.448999999999
some fortunate that they get emotion

8596.069 --> 8601.21
that's where it's disturbing you know

8598.449 --> 8602.82
each so so here's my question so in

8601.21 --> 8605.339999999998
contrast to that like

8602.82 --> 8607.71
what all right there obviously there are

8605.34 --> 8610.35
people who think aliens are the most

8607.71 --> 8612.3
ridiculous thing ever okay I'm sure

8610.35 --> 8614.37
there are people out there like that are

8612.3 --> 8617.520999999999
these people fighting to have ancient

8614.37 --> 8619.5
aliens taken off to lavigne that's been

8617.521 --> 8622.11
on television for how many years now on

8619.5 --> 8625.2
the History Channel that's a way of life

8622.11 --> 8627.09
the peléan thing big that's there that's

8625.2 --> 8631.26
a culture it's more of like a like a

8627.09 --> 8634.01
culture sort of like a like a yeah

8631.26 --> 8636.93
a culture a cultural phenomena

8634.01 --> 8639.6
absolutely it is so because it

8636.93 --> 8643.050000000001
approaches our society for so long

8639.6 --> 8644.73
that's why they're not fighting against

8643.05 --> 8646.47
that even if they completely think it's

8644.73 --> 8648.359999999999
[ __ ] to them it's just what like a

8646.47 --> 8650.4
television show or just crazy people

8648.36 --> 8652.980000000001
there's an inner I'm talking about

8650.4 --> 8654.449999999999
getting abducted there's never an answer

8652.98 --> 8656.76
that we have to deal with those people

8654.45 --> 8658.83
never have to really take responsibility

8656.76 --> 8661.16
for anything because it's always someone

8658.83 --> 8663.271
else's story and deep down they know

8661.16 --> 8667.021
nothing's really gonna happen to them

8663.271 --> 8673.800000000001
maybe they don't but it's it's fun to

8667.021 --> 8677.130000000001
believe it and it's a fun kind of it's a

8673.8 --> 8678.84
fun lifestyle choice you know to be into

8677.13 --> 8683.46
things like that a lot of people use it

8678.84 --> 8685.65
as a badge of how we're thinking like

8683.46 --> 8687.48
someone who's like say I believe in

8685.65 --> 8689.43
aliens I've learned my parents at it my

8687.48 --> 8691.83
mom said it one day and I think it was

8689.43 --> 8694.771
her first foray into like being

8691.83 --> 8697.47
open-minded you know it was like the

8694.771 --> 8701.01
person's first step into like right

8697.47 --> 8706.949999999999
right I know what you mean they're told

8701.01 --> 8709.47
water like might be real right you know

8706.95 --> 8710.640000000001
and you know ever notice how people say

8709.47 --> 8714.66
think outside the box

8710.64 --> 8718.5
right that doesn't that it doesn't that

8714.66 --> 8723.869999999999
imply that we're in boxes yeah I'm not

8718.5 --> 8729.03
in a box no no I hope I'm not in a box

8723.87 --> 8730.710000000001
in a square room rectangular room but I

8729.03 --> 8731.460000000001
mean it's just another one of those

8730.71 --> 8735.97
things

8731.46 --> 8738.25
but our ox is really a sphere hey if you

8735.97 --> 8742.71
take a square and turn it on it's on its

8738.25 --> 8742.71
axis and spin it it turns into a circle

8744.39 --> 8750.119999999999
no not really it turns into an

8747.13 --> 8750.119999999999
eight-sided star

8759.79 --> 8767.77
now just I don't I don't get the hatred

8762.64 --> 8769.72
of it I don't that's serious why do

8767.77 --> 8772.24
people get so bent out of shape and I

8769.72 --> 8775.99
was like yeah bro you really don't know

8772.24 --> 8778.06
and I I have your entire eye but I had

8775.99 --> 8781.21
one guy at my job literally put his

8778.06 --> 8782.5
weight he he looked at me cuz me and

8781.21 --> 8785.8
some other guy were having a

8782.5 --> 8787.51
conversation about this and he came to

8785.8 --> 8789.869999999999
us and he looked at me and he was like

8787.51 --> 8794.02
are you guys you're not talking about

8789.87 --> 8796.439
Flat Earth I just looked on I said of

8794.02 --> 8796.439
course I am

8801.63 --> 8809.41
so what's no I say yeah come over yeah

8807.55 --> 8812.05
jump in the conversation he's like I

8809.41 --> 8815.7
can't do this and I was like come on bro

8812.05 --> 8818.289999999999
come on he starts walking away puts his

8815.7 --> 8821.59
fingers in his ears and says lalala I

8818.29 --> 8823.029
cannot have this conversation now I was

8821.59 --> 8825.58
like wow I know what you should have

8823.029 --> 8828.220000000001
done this is the type of effect this

8825.58 --> 8828.729
just saying Flat Earth has to some

8828.22 --> 8832.09
people

8828.729 --> 8832.929999999998
Wow how do you leave us now chocolate

8832.09 --> 8835.87
how do you think it would have turned

8832.93 --> 8837.52
out had you have said no but we heard

8835.87 --> 8840.04
about it we were we were actually

8837.52 --> 8842.380000000001
talking about how ridiculous it is no if

8840.04 --> 8844.93
you had said that the guy probably would

8842.38 --> 8847.149
have entered the conversation like he

8844.93 --> 8849.49
probably would but at that point he he

8847.149 --> 8852.64
already know like I've already put

8849.49 --> 8854.979
myself out there as a father again I'm

8852.64 --> 8858.608999999999
the one who brings this conversation to

8854.979 --> 8861.099999999999
the job if you're gonna drink I'm

8858.609 --> 8863.109
talking about this if you're gonna trick

8861.1 --> 8866.26
them and they find out they're actually

8863.109 --> 8871.261
gonna be probably a bit pissed off that

8866.26 --> 8873.99
you tricked them well I I believe it

8871.261 --> 8876.061
I don't mean trick I'd like I don't take

8873.99 --> 8879.15
a side if this conversation comes up

8876.061 --> 8882.449999999999
I've found that if I say flat if I'm Pro

8879.15 --> 8885.181
flat or pro round that implies to the

8882.45 --> 8886.681
person usually if it's Pro flat it

8885.181 --> 8888.841
implies to that person that they need to

8886.681 --> 8890.971000000001
make a decision on the spot because if

8888.841 --> 8893.551
they're not willing to accept Flat Earth

8890.971 --> 8895.471
now all of a sudden I've created a

8893.551 --> 8897.301
boundary I've created division between

8895.471 --> 8899.551
me and that person which makes further

8897.301 --> 8903.091
conversation really difficult and

8899.551 --> 8905.279999999999
awkward so I just say yeah I've heard of

8903.091 --> 8907.141
that it's interesting you know I've I

8905.28 --> 8910.650000000001
don't know where I stand it's pretty

8907.141 --> 8913.109999999999
crazy though it's see it's done I think

8910.65 --> 8919.65
about I don't see a different approach

8913.11 --> 8921.36
because at this they the reason people

8919.65 --> 8923.221
know I'm a flat earther is not because I

8921.36 --> 8925.141000000001
walk in it's just like hey guys I

8923.221 --> 8927.391
believe the earth is flat you live in a

8925.141 --> 8930.24
fake ball doesn't exist I didn't do that

8927.391 --> 8932.971
what happened was is that they would

8930.24 --> 8935.461
hear me on the debates because I would

8932.971 --> 8935.971
go on they can use the base while I'm at

8935.461 --> 8940.561
work

8935.971 --> 8945.591
and where do you go huh what do you work

8940.561 --> 8950.15
I work as a assembly technician for

8945.591 --> 8954.421
green energy machine company in Georgia

8950.15 --> 8957.359999999999
so I basically putting together a thirty

8954.421 --> 8963.0
thousand dollar machine while I'm at

8957.36 --> 8964.53
work on the beats so yeah well I just

8963.0 --> 8967.5
got into it cuz I just moved down here

8964.53 --> 8970.53
anything you know you just got it it's

8967.5 --> 8971.94
pretty cool actually like doing it so

8970.53 --> 8976.86
it's pretty awesome

8971.94 --> 8979.141
and uh yeah so while I'm at work they

8976.86 --> 8980.91
all hear me on the debates you know and

8979.141 --> 8985.619999999999
I mean I don't talk all the time but

8980.91 --> 8988.95
when I do you know I hear me so people

8985.62 --> 8991.5
are here night to meet know well a

8988.95 --> 8993.33
couple of people like after the fact

8991.5 --> 8995.82
a couple people have asked me they've

8993.33 --> 8997.891
gotten interested because they'll hear

8995.82 --> 8999.36
me because you know everybody's

8997.891 --> 9001.431
listening to music everybody's got

8999.36 --> 9003.591
headphones in because they thankfully

9001.431 --> 9005.011
they allow us to you know listen to our

9003.591 --> 9006.721
music while we work

9005.011 --> 9009.181
does it just make for better work

9006.721 --> 9013.171
environment right when everybody can

9009.181 --> 9017.04
just focus on everything like Yemen so

9013.171 --> 9018.78
they would hear me every you know every

9017.04 --> 9021.921
once in a while start arguing with

9018.78 --> 9025.681
somebody about taz pressure some weird

9021.921 --> 9028.351
random subject that nobody should be

9025.681 --> 9030.841
talking about you know like these guys

9028.351 --> 9033.091
over here talking about basketball NBA

9030.841 --> 9035.4
you know this [ __ ] and then I'm over

9033.091 --> 9037.83
here you know arguing with somebody

9035.4 --> 9040.141
about ass pressure or curvature or some

9037.83 --> 9043.681
[ __ ] so after a while people come up to

9040.141 --> 9046.051
me like um who are you talking to on

9043.681 --> 9047.37
from the phone over there like you know

9046.051 --> 9050.869999999999
I thought maybe you were on the phone

9047.37 --> 9053.971000000001
but then you you're like kind of

9050.87 --> 9057.12
debating somebody you know skin I think

9053.971 --> 9058.471
yeah that's exactly what I'm doing I'm

9057.12 --> 9060.900000000001
debating they're like what are you

9058.471 --> 9063.211
debating and that's when it starts when

9060.9 --> 9064.891
I have to tell them well obviously I'm

9063.211 --> 9067.680999999999
warbles people that don't believe I live

9064.891 --> 9073.109999999999
on a spinning ball anymore and they look

9067.681 --> 9075.32
at me like wow okay and you're actually

9073.11 --> 9078.721000000001
because they're they'll always tell me

9075.32 --> 9080.851
you know I turn off my music and listen

9078.721 --> 9082.65
to me man you speak because it kind of

9080.851 --> 9083.461000000001
sounds like sort of know what you're

9082.65 --> 9085.891
talking about

9083.461 --> 9088.711
and it's an interesting subject I'm like

9085.891 --> 9090.57
well it's very interesting and then

9088.711 --> 9092.850999999999
that's how the conversation starts and

9090.57 --> 9095.671
see now for nothing I found a couple of

9092.851 --> 9098.49
people at the job already who already

9095.671 --> 9101.461000000001
know that this topic is out there which

9098.49 --> 9104.881
surprised me very much here in Georgia I

9101.461 --> 9106.770999999999
didn't think I'd find anybody you know

9104.881 --> 9110.189999999999
they're not straight straight up and

9106.771 --> 9112.95
down flat earthers but it's kind of just

9110.19 --> 9115.44
like common sense thing like yeah I mean

9112.95 --> 9118.11
seems right to me the ball goes don't

9115.44 --> 9121.021
really I never really thought of it as a

9118.11 --> 9123.150000000001
ball you know you see the globe and it's

9121.021 --> 9124.681
cool but you don't think of it like that

9123.15 --> 9127.19
because you don't think you're spinning

9124.681 --> 9131.421
to you're sticking to a spinning ball

9127.19 --> 9131.421
and I say well there you go

9132.37 --> 9138.320000000002
yeah so I have everybody at my job at

9135.53 --> 9141.380000000001
you know various points talking about

9138.32 --> 9142.97
this and this is all off of them hearing

9141.38 --> 9145.16
me and then every once in a while

9142.97 --> 9146.9
they'll say you know I want to hear the

9145.16 --> 9148.97
show and I tell them you know this is

9146.9 --> 9152.029999999999
something I'm doing why I want YouTube

9148.97 --> 9157.689999999999
right now for these older people younger

9152.03 --> 9160.19
people yeah um a couple of older people

9157.69 --> 9162.021
true meaning that's [ __ ] cool man

9160.19 --> 9164.230000000001
younger don't push it on all them

9162.021 --> 9166.61
younger no I don't evolve you know

9164.23 --> 9170.72
exactly that's exactly what I've done to

9166.61 --> 9174.32
like to engage but it's better to just

9170.72 --> 9176.930999999999
let them show like I think the best

9174.32 --> 9178.789999999999
thing to do is to show that you know you

9176.931 --> 9179.99
yeah I don't need anyone to believe what

9178.79 --> 9181.28
I believe you know I don't need you to

9179.99 --> 9182.9
believe that the earth is flat or you

9181.28 --> 9184.94
know exactly exactly you know

9182.9 --> 9187.369999999999
self-sustaining prophesy don't push it

9184.94 --> 9189.65
on anybody that's all them all eh you

9187.37 --> 9190.04
can look into this and find your own

9189.65 --> 9192.529999999999
thing

9190.04 --> 9196.460000000001
you can find out exactly what I found

9192.53 --> 9198.44
out see what see how you take it but you

9196.46 --> 9201.23
know this is what I do so in this way

9198.44 --> 9203.78
I've opened up a channel for people to

9201.23 --> 9206.21
allow that allows people to come and

9203.78 --> 9208.641000000001
talk to me about this stuff just off of

9206.21 --> 9210.41
hearing me converse which you know

9208.641 --> 9213.8
whoever I'm talking to you on the debate

9210.41 --> 9216.5
such other instead of me just walking up

9213.8 --> 9218.33
to people and say hey here the earth

9216.5 --> 9223.49
flat you know like I don't have to do

9218.33 --> 9227.51
that so I know it's it's made for some

9223.49 --> 9229.88
pretty good conversation at work that

9227.51 --> 9231.710000000001
I've literally stopped and said you know

9229.88 --> 9234.199999999999
I started a conversation with one person

9231.71 --> 9236.66
and it would spread to here to this

9234.2 --> 9239.240000000002
corner to that corner and then I would

9236.66 --> 9243.11
stop and be quiet and listen to the

9239.24 --> 9245.53
entire room now is arguing about flatter

9243.11 --> 9248.300000000001
if this conversation over here is about

that considering my microphone that I

turned out to be a broken mic and yeah

9511.749 --> 9516.009
I'm not gonna be able to get the same

9514.179 --> 9518.649
