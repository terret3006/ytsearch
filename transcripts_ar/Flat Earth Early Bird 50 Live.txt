4.609 --> 11.16
good morning welcome to flatter the

9.24 --> 17.13
earlybird number 50

11.16 --> 20.490000000000002
I'm your host Arwen and yeah it is a

17.13 --> 29.778999999999996
pretty grim weather today at the bike

20.49 --> 29.778999999999996
through all that the rainy gray yuck

29.96 --> 36.32
the weather sucks

33.32 --> 39.82
so I have no panel members yet but the

36.32 --> 43.25
link is open and this time I managed to

39.82 --> 49.16
create a sup hangout in a way that does

43.25 --> 51.32
actually work and now I can't have that

49.16 --> 55.0
yeah I can't have some assistance in the

51.32 --> 59.239
back panel so if some flat-earthers

55.0 --> 63.65
grantee for example joins then I will be

59.239 --> 65.67999999999999
able to open it up and we will be able

63.65 --> 71.17
to get rid of trolls so yeah there is no

65.68 --> 75.369
flatter debates what's going on with ya

71.17 --> 75.369
Nathan's been having a lot of trouble

76.93 --> 86.66000000000001
apparently some corporation some almost

83.33 --> 88.4
faceless corporation doesn't that's not

86.66 --> 94.58
really your corporation has been

88.4 --> 97.16000000000001
striking his channel all of his channels

94.58 --> 100.22
like even the one he made yesterday on

97.16 --> 102.67999999999999
the fly to just do a live stream and

100.22 --> 105.77
after five minutes it got striked as

102.68 --> 108.75
well so somebody's out for him right now

105.77 --> 112.22999999999999
it's not good

108.75 --> 116.22
and well I expect that he will be back

112.23 --> 119.46000000000001
eventually but now he has got to deal

116.22 --> 122.28
with this so that's very annoying also

119.46 --> 125.46
now I feel the pressure on me somewhat

122.28 --> 129.63
because well just look at chat it's full

125.46 --> 132.23999999999998
of trolls oh desperate Oh hungry for

129.63 --> 134.64
their trolling and there's no flat earth

132.24 --> 141.44
debate so now they're here for some

134.64 --> 141.44
reason anyway

145.93 --> 148.89000000000001
no everyone

163.38 --> 165.98
yeah

166.11 --> 173.10000000000002
flat ball yep Nick is blocked from my

169.77 --> 179.0
channel so maybe you're seeing something

173.1 --> 179.0
of the night I'm not so hey was hello

183.769 --> 189.44
Simon Grabowski asked asks why can

187.489 --> 197.15
Nathan join your channel well he

189.44 --> 200.269
probably can if he wants to okay was

197.15 --> 203.17000000000002
once the hangout link fine I'll send you

200.269 --> 203.17000000000002
the hangout link

211.13 --> 213.82
there you go

225.93 --> 230.58
mm 18 it's almost over isn't it

231.54 --> 239.989
what's gonna be happening in 2090 a lot

241.13 --> 244.18
that's what I think

247.02 --> 253.20000000000002
all right okay yeah I did challenge Tim

249.75 --> 255.99
Osman to a one-on-one debate and he said

253.2 --> 260.90999999999997
he accepted it so yeah it's up to him

255.99 --> 264.09000000000003
now yeah I own you give me I'll take him

260.91 --> 270.62
here if he wants or I'll be on his show

264.09 --> 275.09999999999997
whatever he wants but yeah no no hello

270.62 --> 280.35
hello there hey was hey are you going

275.1 --> 283.74
yeah doing good yes or well I have been

280.35 --> 285.77000000000004
doing better hold on let me what's

283.74 --> 288.24
happening hmm

285.77 --> 288.99
what's happened you said you've been

288.24 --> 291.54
doing better

288.99 --> 295.68
what something's happened I don't know

291.54 --> 297.92
maybe it's just a year transition I've

295.68 --> 301.23
just been feeling very annoyed very

297.92 --> 303.12
agitated just kidding old mate I can

301.23 --> 314.22
tell you the old you get the grumpy you

303.12 --> 317.16
get no I don't know sometimes I just

314.22 --> 320.64000000000004
have these days and I don't really like

317.16 --> 323.07000000000005
the debates is gone because now because

320.64 --> 327.59999999999997
of that this show functions differently

323.07 --> 329.88
as well like I had a good balance with

327.6 --> 333.08000000000004
him after my show that worked really

329.88 --> 335.37
well for me but now that he's not here

333.08 --> 338.28
it seems there's just a lot more

335.37 --> 342.51
pressure on me because of it like I have

338.28 --> 345.39
to fill in for no you don't you don't

342.51 --> 348.3
have to do that they relax me I know I

345.39 --> 350.07
don't have to but it's your shirt it's

348.3 --> 354.21000000000004
your sure I think I know I know

350.07 --> 357.71999999999997
but that just naturally happens yeah

354.21 --> 360.41999999999996
true I mean you gotta exercise that

357.72 --> 364.20000000000005
you're it's you now all right so I can

360.42 --> 366.24
just like drop it and say yeah screw

364.2 --> 369.57
that I'm just gonna ignore it all but

366.24 --> 372.6
then oh I'm not saying you or it and say

369.57 --> 374.87
you take it in you absorb it and you let

372.6 --> 374.87
it go

375.3 --> 387.66
I guess that seems the wisest I'm just

378.68 --> 392.25
not happy about about it huh yeah how

387.66 --> 393.96000000000004
are you doing well it's some 20 past

392.25 --> 396.15
1:00 in the morning and I've heard a

393.96 --> 403.79999999999995
couple of drinks oh I'm happy a little

396.15 --> 407.19
bit well lubricated mm-hmm you're I've

403.8 --> 412.98
got a few days off work so I thought I'd

407.19 --> 415.89
take advantage and have a chat yeah is

412.98 --> 420.48
my mic playing uh somebody I know my mic

415.89 --> 423.3
but that's always a problem look I'm

420.48 --> 426.56
gonna try to install audio banana in the

423.3 --> 429.42
same program that Nathan's mom using

426.56 --> 433.62
unfortunately to work with it is a lot

429.42 --> 437.07
more complicated than OBS even so he

433.62 --> 440.07
forwarded me a YouTube video on how to

437.07 --> 441.56
deal with it but it's like 15 or 20

440.07 --> 446.84999999999997
minutes long

441.56 --> 449.07
chicas yeah and I didn't want to I don't

446.85 --> 451.59000000000003
want to so now I'm just gonna have to

449.07 --> 456.39
put myself to it and then do it I hope I

451.59 --> 462.35999999999996
will have it worked out before before

456.39 --> 464.01
the next weekend as well but yeah I'm

462.36 --> 465.96000000000004
good yeah that's the only way I'm gonna

464.01 --> 469.08
fix this audio because my microphone

465.96 --> 472.97999999999996
audio for some reason is just extremely

469.08 --> 476.09999999999997
low and it's I'm not having how many

472.98 --> 479.76
issues hearing you I I can't help it I

476.1 --> 484.32000000000005
could probably put it up 200% but what

479.76 --> 486.53999999999996
would happen then is that I would be

484.32 --> 490.23
slightly more audible but you would also

486.54 --> 492.99
be hearing a lot of noise the actual

490.23 --> 496.8
YouTube and that's just yeah that's not

492.99 --> 499.17
good well some reason here how do I know

496.8 --> 500.31
it's old on audio through the Hangout

499.17 --> 504.38
itself is okay

500.31 --> 507.44
but the audio that is coming out of OBS

504.38 --> 510.1
that is actually being inserted into the

507.44 --> 514.01
YouTube video that is just not very good

510.1 --> 515.27
that's right I heard that yesterday I

514.01 --> 518.15
think it was mm-hmm

515.27 --> 520.6999999999999
who's got a background hiss before I

518.15 --> 523.43
joined I joined that he's died off I can

520.7 --> 527.48
still hear a bit of his knell that's not

523.43 --> 532.4599999999999
too bad yeah it could be worse but it's

527.48 --> 535.73
just not very good like yeah on a

532.46 --> 537.77
regular format it's house hangout

535.73 --> 539.2
setting the audio is a lot better even

537.77 --> 542.5699999999999
though the video is kind of primitive

539.2 --> 544.73
now I got the video a much better thanks

542.57 --> 547.5500000000001
to OBS but now the audio is kind of

544.73 --> 550.82
primitive it's kind of basic so yeah I

547.55 --> 552.56
gotta fix it once I fix it it's not

550.82 --> 557.09
gonna be an issue anymore I'm just gonna

552.56 --> 558.6199999999999
have good audio and much better muting

557.09 --> 562.1600000000001
options and all that kind of thing

558.62 --> 567.2
because it's kind of messy now too but

562.16 --> 570.01
yeah okay you get they might I have

567.2 --> 570.01
confidence in you

574.7 --> 585.6
there's whether it's so great really

579.84 --> 588.15
yeah it is it's just this constant mini

585.6 --> 590.37
ray like these miniature drops it's

588.15 --> 593.28
almost like a crossover between mist and

590.37 --> 595.05
radiance like everywhere so now we

593.28 --> 599.88
normally call that we call that drizzle

595.05 --> 603.42
drizzle right right we call it not like

599.88 --> 606.71
moths rain I don't know why let's just

603.42 --> 610.1899999999999
do how Dutch you call it okay

606.71 --> 616.07
hey Randi flatterers in chat hello and

610.19 --> 616.07
LBB store it's good to see you guys

617.15 --> 626.9
and there is pretty much all ballers and

622.43 --> 632.51
what are we to do although I think

626.9 --> 634.88
Charles Pilkington it's not a bar don't

632.51 --> 636.86
think so yeah there's probably gonna be

634.88 --> 637.88
a lot of new subscribers in my chat that

636.86 --> 646.01
I don't know yet

637.88 --> 648.65
so I gotta get to know them all yeah

646.01 --> 651.29
Pete Pete change it asking you from

648.65 --> 654.04
flood it and they're what gives you that

651.29 --> 654.04
impression Pete

654.13 --> 661.58
is it because I'm not being a bastard to

656.63 --> 665.87
Alan how are you a baller I've always

661.58 --> 678.5
been a 400k it's not change your opinion

665.87 --> 681.38
of me yeah didn't realize it's that I

678.5 --> 684.85
don't really mind it's just yeah you

681.38 --> 688.16
don't have a predisposition to that dear

684.85 --> 693.08
it all depends I always like to know

688.16 --> 698.4499999999999
what drives you a person to believe in

693.08 --> 700.24
the ball despite all the data yeah well

698.45 --> 703.25
it works both ways doesn't it really

700.24 --> 706.3
in what sense and book ball was asked

703.25 --> 709.4
the same question a bit flat earthers

706.3 --> 713.5999999999999
well what questions do you have to ask

709.4 --> 715.1
hey Adam eating but what drives you what

713.6 --> 717.38
drives you to believe it there it is

715.1 --> 720.2900000000001
flat with all the evidence we have that

717.38 --> 723.7
it's not it works both ways it's off I'm

720.29 --> 727.63
saying well it doesn't really it's just

723.7 --> 730.76
equipment no it's no it's a rumor it's

727.63 --> 734.66
that's just a rumor going around in

730.76 --> 736.4
among the globus to say yeah it's being

734.66 --> 739.67
ignored but it's not we worked

736.4 --> 742.1899999999999
everything out very detailed and we

739.67 --> 744.52
expose certain myths like terrestrial

742.19 --> 749.5200000000001
refraction which has no

744.52 --> 752.98
actual roots in actual optics and yeah

749.52 --> 758.77
so you could ask that question but it's

752.98 --> 762.5500000000001
based on false assumptions there there

758.77 --> 765.31
really isn't any evidence of a globe

762.55 --> 767.89
there is presuppositional arguing like

765.31 --> 771.43
the celestial globe of the heavens and

767.89 --> 774.64
presuming that is all physically literal

771.43 --> 777.01
in place and yeah one could derive a

774.64 --> 779.68
conclusion that if that is the case if

777.01 --> 782.95
you presume that that is true that the

779.68 --> 787.0889999999999
earth has no other option than to be a

782.95 --> 790.3900000000001
ball folded underneath that globe of the

787.089 --> 792.7900000000001
heavens and that is a foundation for

790.39 --> 795.01
global reasoning it is a presupposition

792.79 --> 796.87
of our literally based on the

795.01 --> 799.42
observations of the globe of the heavens

796.87 --> 803.29
and assuming they are in physical

799.42 --> 805.81
natural position somehow isn't a Caprice

803.29 --> 806.89
a globe of the heavens isn't that are

805.81 --> 809.3199999999999
you talking about the time.they or

806.89 --> 812.05
something I I'm talking about the globe

809.32 --> 815.9100000000001
of the heavens all that the Stars the

812.05 --> 819.66
moon the Sun the planets that we see

815.91 --> 823.12
always at the edge of our vision in

819.66 --> 826.27
presenting presented to us with insights

823.12 --> 828.01
as a globe surrounding us or a damn my

826.27 --> 831.36
glow basically because you never see the

828.01 --> 834.279
bottom half well it tends to work out

831.36 --> 837.4590000000001
well sure everything works out according

834.279 --> 839.29
to models but only if you use models

837.459 --> 841.63
that presume that they are are in

839.29 --> 845.1999999999999
physical literal positions which is a

841.63 --> 847.66
critical part of those models because if

845.2 --> 849.73
you don't have any presuppositions of

847.66 --> 851.37
literal positions then nothing's really

849.73 --> 855.97
gonna work out there's no connection

851.37 --> 859.12
guess what there isn't because it's

855.97 --> 862.3190000000001
pretty supposed that it is without any

859.12 --> 865.41
real proof for it

862.319 --> 868.29
I always in this follow Zynga yeah my

865.41 --> 872.16
profile picture just kind of [ __ ] up

868.29 --> 875.009
somehow I don't know um I I miss I miss

872.16 --> 877.4699999999999
Nathan show it is like a cold detox

875.009 --> 882.3290000000001
ination something is missing right now

877.47 --> 887.639
it's called cold turkey yep

882.329 --> 891.289
feel empty now you poor boy I think I'm

887.639 --> 891.289
not the only one who feels that way

891.829 --> 896.189
sorry buddy

893.399 --> 898.529
I've got paid sharing in comments asking

896.189 --> 903.7489999999999
me a few things should I address him or

898.529 --> 906.019
should all just leave it these questions

903.749 --> 908.91
he's addressing me with some questions

906.019 --> 910.589
should I address his questions answer

908.91 --> 921.269
them or should I just let him go

910.589 --> 925.0390000000001
depends on what he thinks he thinks I'm

921.269 --> 929.129
a faker he's asking if I'm a faker

925.039 --> 933.239
all right what's up to you if you want

929.129 --> 935.8190000000001
to answer that only basically I

933.239 --> 939.629
basically in a concise manner just show

935.819 --> 942.299
to you that the rumor that is going

939.629 --> 945.259
around among Globus that earth are that

942.299 --> 950.22
flat earthers are not reciprocating

945.259 --> 952.9490000000001
answers to certain questions as just as

950.22 --> 955.679
the globus are proven to do with letter

952.949 --> 959.579
thir that is a rumor and I just proved

955.679 --> 961.439
to you why because it is based on the

959.579 --> 964.2299999999999
base assumption that there is evidence

961.439 --> 967.6189999999999
for globe Earth and that can be retraced

964.23 --> 969.2090000000001
to the presuppositions of our and where

967.619 --> 970.97
that's coming from from the the

969.209 --> 973.5889999999999
assumptions of the globe of the heavens

970.97 --> 977.039
being into the spiritual positions and

973.589 --> 980.609
everything so I presupposition now

977.039 --> 983.609
praise the position in the belief that

980.609 --> 986.4290000000001
the world is flat at all that's not

983.609 --> 988.499
presupposition there you see no there's

986.429 --> 992.3389999999999
no need for it all right

988.499 --> 993.379
the only presupposition we have is that

992.339 --> 996.109
we

993.379 --> 999.769
see things because they're there because

996.109 --> 1003.339
there are in the line of sight and one

999.769 --> 1005.319
can draw logical conclusions from this

1003.339 --> 1009.8190000000001
it's not even deductions it's just

1005.319 --> 1013.4789999999999
logical conclusion its ruling out

1009.819 --> 1017.1089999999999
certain options geometrically on see

1013.479 --> 1020.979
certain things within a line of sight

1017.109 --> 1024.059
that will exclude certain geometrical

1020.979 --> 1027.459
possibilities for the shape of the earth

1024.059 --> 1030.309
all right I tested the angle of you hang

1027.459 --> 1033.669
for myself a few days before I went on

1030.309 --> 1036.819
Nathan show and we shouted at each other

1033.669 --> 1040.959
Nathan and I guess why because what I

1036.819 --> 1043.87
attested it 100 metres away I couldn't

1040.959 --> 1050.47
find anything I tested it with a laser

1043.87 --> 1055.299
to be sure that the floor is flat to the

1050.47 --> 1056.679
floor with your camera again how close

1055.299 --> 1060.34
did you get to the floor with your

1056.679 --> 1062.47
camera it's like I don't know 1

1060.34 --> 1066.73
centimeter because the camera is 1

1062.47 --> 1069.519
centimeter high and the laser was like 1

1066.73 --> 1074.2
centimeter of in there too because if I

1069.519 --> 1078.3700000000001
took a laser scaler to be sure I will

1074.2 --> 1081.419
make another video 1 centimeter 400

1078.37 --> 1084.309
meters maybe just simply not be enough

1081.419 --> 1088.539
for such a short distance just compare

1084.309 --> 1092.559
the observer height to the distances

1088.539 --> 1094.6
we're viewing in the for example

1092.559 --> 1099.25
rattie's footage and just compare the

1094.6 --> 1101.35
two it's yeah 400 meters just I think

1099.25 --> 1104.08
you you'd be have to talking about being

1101.35 --> 1107.7099999999998
millimeters from the floor with the

1104.08 --> 1110.049
actual camera Center points with the

1107.71 --> 1112.409
other center point the thing is like

1110.049 --> 1117.509
hoses observations with the light that

1112.409 --> 1119.8300000000002
kinda made me starting belief that the

1117.509 --> 1123.929
ships disappearing band horizon is

1119.83 --> 1126.61
because of um the angle of view thing

1123.929 --> 1131.65
his observation burns

1126.61 --> 1136.27
even 100 meter away like you know on

1131.65 --> 1138.7900000000002
Nathan's book disappearing wasn't even

1136.27 --> 1142.83
100 meter away and all all those claims

1138.79 --> 1145.9289999999999
were angle of you all of them yeah and

1142.83 --> 1149.11
my observation like 100 meters away with

1145.929 --> 1151.72
a laser buffing but that makes sense

1149.11 --> 1156.3999999999999
because for example on the football

1151.72 --> 1158.83
field there was grass so that grass will

1156.4 --> 1162.669
be the actual the average length of the

1158.83 --> 1165.37
grass will be the flat surface that is

1162.669 --> 1167.14
actually gonna be the thing obstructing

1165.37 --> 1169.75
things in the background so you've got

1167.14 --> 1173.65
to compare the lens the the middle of

1169.75 --> 1176.559
the lens height to the average grass

1173.65 --> 1179.5590000000002
length because that's the actual surface

1176.559 --> 1182.02
you're looking over practically so

1179.559 --> 1184.299
that's gonna be more closer to it than

1182.02 --> 1191.8899999999999
one centimeter trust me it might be even

1184.299 --> 1195.1299999999999
be right in the middle of it and that's

1191.89 --> 1200.5900000000001
it well then the dinner afford further

1195.13 --> 1204.94
about it right because it if you why

1200.59 --> 1208.99
should the laser just like stop reaching

1204.94 --> 1213.25
the camera even after 5 kilometers 10

1208.99 --> 1218.01
kilometers why should it stop reaching

1213.25 --> 1221.08
the point at once what's the point

1218.01 --> 1222.97
it's objected to their fraction if it's

1221.08 --> 1228.1299999999999
gonna travel over surface that surface

1222.97 --> 1231.429
gonna have an influence on it Katherine

1228.13 --> 1233.2900000000002
once it gets too close and that's gonna

1231.429 --> 1237.22
basically prevent it from passing

1233.29 --> 1242.3799999999999
through so it's gonna evade it's gonna

1237.22 --> 1246.73
not be visible under certain height that

1242.38 --> 1249.669
that's kind of what I stopped believing

1246.73 --> 1253.059
that it is a thing that a fraction over

1249.669 --> 1256.5900000000001
the ground but I don't the same thing

1253.059 --> 1258.2
it's the same it's all the same effect

1256.59 --> 1260.87
diffraction

1258.2 --> 1263.21
angle of view it's all within

1260.87 --> 1268.07
perspective it's all part of it of site

1263.21 --> 1270.83
itself 3ds site I'm going to make

1268.07 --> 1273.5
further observations and I'm going to be

1270.83 --> 1274.97
open to it I don't think it is a thing

1273.5 --> 1278.27
anymore

1274.97 --> 1283.1200000000001
I think it is just made up to form some

1278.27 --> 1286.85
excuses but like I like seeing mountains

1283.12 --> 1290.299
low like kilometers away in in plain

1286.85 --> 1292.78
sight no like you know ships

1290.299 --> 1295.19
disappearing behind the horizon with

1292.78 --> 1297.71
looking at them and saying all right of

1295.19 --> 1301.88
this perspective I now think that there

1297.71 --> 1304.3400000000001
is actually water in the way but I why

1301.88 --> 1308.8400000000001
why isn't it what's wrong with the

1304.34 --> 1311.6599999999999
explanation that we get I think water

1308.84 --> 1315.3799999999999
blocks the light that should reach us

1311.66 --> 1319.1000000000001
from the ship yeah I know

1315.38 --> 1322.25
that's what we think as well direction

1319.1 --> 1324.7099999999998
but not in terms of diffraction that the

1322.25 --> 1326.48
waves I don't know kind of interact with

1324.71 --> 1330.44
each other and then cancel each other

1326.48 --> 1333.98
out whatever I think it is because there

1330.44 --> 1336.6200000000001
is actually a curve that blocks the

1333.98 --> 1338.84
light well then you're being a fool

1336.62 --> 1340.58
because if there is a curve that

1338.84 --> 1343.1299999999999
actually blocks the light at that point

1340.58 --> 1345.86
there should be a cumulative drop and

1343.13 --> 1349.0700000000002
there should be an absolute limit to any

1345.86 --> 1353.53
type of sight after a certain distance

1349.07 --> 1353.53
sorry there it goes and there isn't

1353.559 --> 1360.32
sorry to drop two things when Anthony

1357.65 --> 1364.2800000000002
Raleigh's asked me to ask you if he can

1360.32 --> 1366.02
send him a link for the ham place and I

1364.28 --> 1367.91
just hold on hold

1366.02 --> 1371.72
Riley if you want to do that then just

1367.91 --> 1374.3600000000001
get in the freaking skype room stop

1371.72 --> 1376.13
dropping everywhere and isolating

1374.36 --> 1379.01
yourself and actually be part of the

1376.13 --> 1381.8300000000002
freakin group I put hangout links in

1379.01 --> 1387.62
there so if you want to be on the show

1381.83 --> 1390.4399999999998
then get in the Skype crew okay okay and

1387.62 --> 1391.12
the other thing was oh he's saying he's

1390.44 --> 1394.72
blocked

1391.12 --> 1396.3999999999999
oh he's not he's not true

1394.72 --> 1399.07
he's not being saying he's blocked he's

1396.4 --> 1399.94
not he says he says you have him blocked

1399.07 --> 1402.9099999999999
on his channel

1399.94 --> 1404.41
I don't it's not true um just don't

1402.91 --> 1406.18
shoot the messenger he I'm just know you

1404.41 --> 1408.5800000000002
know and I'm responding and saying it's

1406.18 --> 1411.3700000000001
not true I don't have him blocked if you

1408.58 --> 1414.46
have him blocked then we could never be

1411.37 --> 1417.1
in the same panel on the debate so no I

1414.46 --> 1422.1100000000001
don't have him blocked he says he can't

1417.1 --> 1424.48
post a public message my talk on tape

1422.11 --> 1426.82
don'ti some dust really busting together

1424.48 --> 1436.48
the toilet all right dad just take it

1426.82 --> 1440.59
okay give me some minute there Justin

1436.48 --> 1444.34
check here so if you look in the actual

1440.59 --> 1448.78
YouTube then you can see yourself in the

1444.34 --> 1451.08
chat so you're not blocked see right

1448.78 --> 1451.08
there

1457.28 --> 1463.06
let me see a moment if I can take this

1459.77 --> 1467.36
connecting to camera thing away I

1463.06 --> 1471.98
connect my phone to the computer as

1467.36 --> 1477.9799999999998
webcam right but kinda didn't work that

1471.98 --> 1481.73
well so is it annoying to you seeing

1477.98 --> 1486.17
their connecting to camera thing does it

1481.73 --> 1498.02
annoy you the connecting to camera thing

1486.17 --> 1499.97
that is in the background right listen

1498.02 --> 1501.65
listen let me just update you I was

1499.97 --> 1503.48
posting publicly and they weren't coming

1501.65 --> 1505.4
up on the public chat feed that's why I

1503.48 --> 1507.02
got the impression I was blocked so I

1505.4 --> 1508.46
asked Twitter it to try and contact you

1507.02 --> 1511.01
to let you know what you'd stop the

1508.46 --> 1512.99
automatic script feed on that and on the

1511.01 --> 1515.0
live chat so you couldn't see a

1512.99 --> 1516.5
messaging you so then I got Adam to do

1515.0 --> 1518.18
it meeting and he did it and then he

1516.5 --> 1519.86
didn't see it and the only one I could

1518.18 --> 1521.66
think of to get to was once cuz he was

1519.86 --> 1523.1599999999999
on the panel or for some reason why I

1521.66 --> 1524.63
put my messages weren't being publicly

1523.16 --> 1528.26
posted for some reason and I don't know

1524.63 --> 1531.3400000000001
why bizarre but and then when I tested

1528.26 --> 1536.27
it it [ __ ] worked I was like what

1531.34 --> 1536.99
right anyway oh I don't have you blogs I

1536.27 --> 1539.12
don't get it

1536.99 --> 1540.5
I used to have you blocked but I don't

1539.12 --> 1544.04
for a long time

1540.5 --> 1546.32
so I don't see what the issue is about

1544.04 --> 1548.24
are you interested in an update from

1546.32 --> 1551.33
what what's going on in Camp Nathan oh

1548.24 --> 1553.28
yeah I gave her a small update of what I

1551.33 --> 1557.3
know but sure go ahead

1553.28 --> 1558.8
he's good yurina Anthony hello hello sir

1557.3 --> 1567.01
thank you very much for your help sir I

1558.8 --> 1568.97
appreciate it I was just saying

1567.01 --> 1571.31
frantically trying to get in so I've

1568.97 --> 1572.51
just been sat watching chat yeah so

1571.31 --> 1574.82
shout out to twit which she actually

1572.51 --> 1579.3799999999999
helped me and so it was and Adam so

1574.82 --> 1581.45
anyway and yeah cam Nathan its back in

1579.38 --> 1583.16
control but the problem is if he called

1581.45 --> 1585.6200000000001
live he's just gonna lose his channel

1583.16 --> 1587.27
again so he can't go live until they get

1585.62 --> 1588.5
some what called a moratorium on his

1587.27 --> 1590.0
account which is what he's gonna be

1588.5 --> 1590.69
getting next but you cannot get it until

1590.0 --> 1592.22
Monday

1590.69 --> 1594.529
so I don't think he's gonna be doing

1592.22 --> 1596.809
anything at all till Monday and because

1594.529 --> 1598.82
the way that things working in terms of

1596.809 --> 1600.019
YouTube over Christmas and New Year

1598.82 --> 1601.279
they've just not like stuff in to be

1600.019 --> 1603.289
able to deal with things and getting

1601.279 --> 1604.909
everybody's getting the same workload

1603.289 --> 1606.649
over the Christmas period but the can't

1604.909 --> 1607.94
deal with it all so he said they've just

1606.649 --> 1610.1899999999998
said right there's your account back

1607.94 --> 1612.049
kind of thing but Nathan knows that if

1610.19 --> 1614.169
he goes live again it'll just get sniped

1612.049 --> 1616.9089999999999
again or not sniped you'll get em

1614.169 --> 1618.289
maliciously copyright struck again so

1616.909 --> 1619.97
that I'll just bring him back down again

1618.289 --> 1621.529
so he has to wait until Monday until

1619.97 --> 1622.909
someone happens on Monday and I think

1621.529 --> 1624.859
they can put some kind of like safe

1622.909 --> 1627.0490000000002
around this program around this channel

1624.859 --> 1631.1899999999998
to stop malicious software malicious

1627.049 --> 1633.71
counts in malicious copyright strike

1631.19 --> 1635.0900000000001
claims because that's what is the demon

1633.71 --> 1636.409
but he's not the amended sniping he's

1635.09 --> 1638.809
the owner is someone that claims that

1636.409 --> 1641.5390000000002
he's got copyright material in his work

1638.809 --> 1643.22
and that he claims ownership to and

1641.539 --> 1644.419
because the copyright law states that

1643.22 --> 1646.19
it's gotta be removed from her

1644.419 --> 1648.169
straightaway then they have to remove

1646.19 --> 1650.299
the straightaway well because he's got

1648.169 --> 1652.1290000000001
multiple channels and multiple strikes

1650.299 --> 1654.32
they can see that he's being targeted

1652.129 --> 1655.609
specifically for some reason but because

1654.32 --> 1656.9289999999999
it's Christmas and New Year someone's

1655.609 --> 1658.7289999999998
just realized that there's a weak link

1656.929 --> 1661.19
in the EM in the YouTube staffing

1658.729 --> 1663.349
situation so that's been exploited and

1661.19 --> 1665.059
these if he goes live today you'll just

1663.349 --> 1666.769
be it'll be again it'll be back to

1665.059 --> 1668.239
square one and he said just forget it

1666.769 --> 1670.22
just leave it a couple of days well sort

1668.239 --> 1671.859
it out a little part of the week in the

1670.22 --> 1674.3890000000001
new year when he gets back started so

1671.859 --> 1676.7289999999998
he's took his daughter out to some

1674.389 --> 1678.2289999999998
Spanish class or whatever and then you

1676.729 --> 1680.1490000000001
have another gold in the new year once

1678.229 --> 1683.509
once normal service resumes because at

1680.149 --> 1685.2199999999998
the minute we've just found a like a you

1683.509 --> 1686.779
know I can under understaffed position

1685.22 --> 1688.759
in YouTube or Christmas and New Year

1686.779 --> 1690.47
that's been exploited and once this is

1688.759 --> 1692.269
out the way it'll be it'll be back to

1690.47 --> 1694.179
normal again so that's as far as I'm

1692.269 --> 1696.499
aware and that was about an hour ago

1694.179 --> 1699.8300000000002
interestingly I thought that has

1696.499 --> 1704.45
something to do with him talking about

1699.83 --> 1706.82
raping Tim Osmonds tool it's to do with

1704.45 --> 1708.6490000000001
is to do with a spurious claim of

1706.82 --> 1711.049
copyright ownership from somebody that

1708.649 --> 1713.539
doesn't have even a YouTube channel and

1711.049 --> 1715.489
that is claiming ownership of some

1713.539 --> 1717.649
elements of his work that he hasn't got

1715.489 --> 1719.269
any rights to but because he's triggered

1717.649 --> 1721.4599999999998
that on a live broadcast they've got to

1719.269 --> 1723.049
take it down so what they can do to stop

1721.46 --> 1724.5
it is implement some what called a

1723.049 --> 1728.1
moratorium which puts

1724.5 --> 1730.23
from any copyright strikes for a certain

1728.1 --> 1731.34
period but they can't do it until they

1730.23 --> 1732.89
get enough staffing because it takes

1731.34 --> 1734.8799999999999
time for them to go through this process

1732.89 --> 1736.26
so he's just gotta follow up with it for

1734.88 --> 1738.8700000000001
the next couple of days I mean what we

1736.26 --> 1740.67
are now the 28th 29th by the time we get

1738.87 --> 1742.4699999999998
to the 2nd of January it'll be a case of

1740.67 --> 1743.88
right everyone's back in work again so

1742.47 --> 1745.6200000000001
it'll be a case of then somebody will

1743.88 --> 1747.24
get to it in the bill with it so for the

1745.62 --> 1748.77
next 2 or 3 days you may not do anything

1747.24 --> 1751.02
well I know we won't be doing anything

1748.77 --> 1752.55
and then Bala Tommy gets to write the

1751.02 --> 1753.78
second then he should be in a position

1752.55 --> 1755.31
because he should have this moratorium

1753.78 --> 1757.3799999999999
over him to stop him from being

1755.31 --> 1759.09
maliciously struck and then that's

1757.38 --> 1762.0300000000002
basically where it is that's where he's

1759.09 --> 1764.1899999999998
at I didn't know you need a YouTube

1762.03 --> 1767.61
channel to claim copyrights right

1764.19 --> 1769.3500000000001
I mean no you don't need just convenient

1767.61 --> 1771.1799999999998
to assume it if you have your own

1769.35 --> 1773.1299999999999
YouTube channel but if you're Sony for

1771.18 --> 1774.75
example and you don't have a YouTube

1773.13 --> 1776.5200000000002
channel because you are so on your own

1774.75 --> 1778.32
like a massive corporation that doesn't

1776.52 --> 1780.21
need a YouTube channel you can still

1778.32 --> 1782.01
enjoy copyright strikes just you just

1780.21 --> 1783.63
don't do it through YouTube you do do it

1782.01 --> 1785.91
to YouTube but not through YouTube

1783.63 --> 1787.44
through your own channel and you can do

1785.91 --> 1789.21
it that way but the way that this has

1787.44 --> 1791.13
been done is not through YouTube as as I

1789.21 --> 1793.6100000000001
understand it and even if it is through

1791.13 --> 1795.5400000000002
YouTube as I understand it is it

1793.61 --> 1797.55
Nathan's gonna get the benefit of

1795.54 --> 1798.81
something called moratorium and that

1797.55 --> 1800.82
just stops anything from happening

1798.81 --> 1802.32
against him and when it requires a human

1800.82 --> 1804.54
interaction rather than an automated

1802.32 --> 1806.79
process and because he's being targeted

1804.54 --> 1809.1299999999999
so I think he's on with it I think he's

1806.79 --> 1810.57
got he's got it sorted well it's just

1809.13 --> 1813.47
cuz at a time of the year he's not able

1810.57 --> 1816.47
to do anything like quickly because

1813.47 --> 1819.72
charging capabilities or any of these

1816.47 --> 1821.91
super Jets etc does it one sorry

1819.72 --> 1825.42
does it affect any of these advertising

1821.91 --> 1826.74
revenue or see lose when he gets it back

1825.42 --> 1828.78
when he gets it back will he have to

1826.74 --> 1830.61
build that up again or does it all race

1828.78 --> 1832.02
it and come back to normal no he'll be

1830.61 --> 1833.61
put back into the position he was before

1832.02 --> 1835.35
the original claim but you'll just have

1833.61 --> 1837.0
a protection as a Carroll because he is

1835.35 --> 1838.32
because he's got more than a thousand

1837.0 --> 1840.42
subs that he's got a lot of content and

1838.32 --> 1842.37
he's been running for a while he is

1840.42 --> 1845.0700000000002
regularly come in contributing to

1842.37 --> 1846.6299999999999
YouTube they see Nathan as a reputable

1845.07 --> 1848.76
source even if they disagree with his

1846.63 --> 1850.5600000000002
content the seam is repeatable because

1848.76 --> 1851.8799999999999
he is doing regular videos every single

1850.56 --> 1853.77
day and they want Matt that's the kind

1851.88 --> 1855.99
of content that the one they might have

1853.77 --> 1858.24
no ties Minh he's making the money yeah

1855.99 --> 1860.76
yeah he's helping you to build their own

1858.24 --> 1862.11
there is really a worker for YouTube and

1860.76 --> 1864.179
I think we all miss him when he's not

1862.11 --> 1866.01
there even if we disagree with him it's

1864.179 --> 1867.3000000000002
kind of like aimless like I said in on

1866.01 --> 1869.429
the shoulder the day it's like aimlessly

1867.3 --> 1870.57
walking around quoting back housekeeping

1869.429 --> 1872.67
because what I'll see you to do when

1870.57 --> 1874.35
this when two o'clock comes right but

1872.67 --> 1876.72
anyway the bottom line I need to

1874.35 --> 1880.08
generalize I mean you so we all miss him

1876.72 --> 1882.03
well he's a character whether you like

1880.08 --> 1884.79
him or hating like people like to hate

1882.03 --> 1888.57
people and Nathan's don't like lawns

1884.79 --> 1891.09
Farquhar I'm sure it may be I can't

1888.57 --> 1892.83
remember who he is but you know

1891.09 --> 1894.75
everybody likes the body right and if

1892.83 --> 1896.76
Nathan's seen as the body by the ballers

1894.75 --> 1898.679
I mean - I mean obviously Tour Z is

1896.76 --> 1900.96
their Messiah or whatever but - you guys

1898.679 --> 1902.76
you love to hate him and I think to have

1900.96 --> 1904.1100000000001
someone like that in this discussion is

1902.76 --> 1906.12
actually better than not having him at

1904.11 --> 1907.53
all because if you can all hate him then

1906.12 --> 1909.6
that's isn't that better than not having

1907.53 --> 1911.28
him to hate at all how that thing hates

1909.6 --> 1912.6599999999999
a good thing Mike it's not good for the

1911.28 --> 1915.12
yeah no but you know what I mean yeah I

1912.66 --> 1917.0700000000002
don't mean it literally I mean we are

1915.12 --> 1918.51
the debate itself if you've got somebody

1917.07 --> 1920.28
that you can vent off your frustrations

1918.51 --> 1922.32
and call whatever names that you want to

1920.28 --> 1925.8
and he ignores most of it I mean he

1922.32 --> 1927.21
sometimes gets rattled but at least do

1925.8 --> 1928.8899999999999
you think it's good to bring that out in

1927.21 --> 1932.16
people to bring that sort of venom out

1928.89 --> 1933.5400000000002
in people yes it's therapeutical well

1932.16 --> 1935.3700000000001
you could ask the same question back

1933.54 --> 1936.9289999999999
generally over bowlers as well because

1935.37 --> 1939.2099999999998
there's a lot of others I'm just asking

1936.929 --> 1943.2900000000002
genuinely out the humans for both yes it

1939.21 --> 1945.809
is vertical I think there has to be a

1943.29 --> 1948.03
release valve is not a release valve be

1945.809 --> 1950.94
expecting frustrated well that's why God

1948.03 --> 1954.809
invented alcohol no but keep ISM that's

1950.94 --> 1957.39
not release that may release it I use my

1954.809 --> 1958.92
own price it's also high so no I think

1957.39 --> 1961.2
that if Nathan's the scapegoat for

1958.92 --> 1963.03
ballers to be hated and he's alright

1961.2 --> 1965.55
with that any likely I mean he does seem

1963.03 --> 1967.35
to like it if he's comfortable being it

1965.55 --> 1968.8799999999999
got footballers then I don't see any

1967.35 --> 1970.9499999999998
reason why he shouldn't be there just

1968.88 --> 1972.63
because so I don't know I don't know

1970.95 --> 1974.16
what the mock I don't know we know who

1972.63 --> 1975.45
it is but we don't know what what the

1974.16 --> 1977.52
reason is we don't know if it's personal

1975.45 --> 1979.17
against Nathan and because we did

1977.52 --> 1980.73
discuss whether or not I should just run

1979.17 --> 1983.28
the debate show on my channel just to

1980.73 --> 1985.17
see if I get struck that would mean it's

1983.28 --> 1987.48
not personal against Nathan it's an

1985.17 --> 1989.0700000000002
attack on fire generally or should we

1987.48 --> 1990.6
just leave it and just leave it off in

1989.07 --> 1992.25
the air and Nathan just said just leave

1990.6 --> 1993.4499999999998
it he said I'll sort it out in a couple

1992.25 --> 1995.7
they said I'll have a couple more days

1993.45 --> 1996.96
offices I don't mind and I didn't really

1995.7 --> 1998.7
want to put my channel up and get

1996.96 --> 2000.3500000000001
involved in it because if it did get

1998.7 --> 2002.0
struck even though I don't do live

2000.35 --> 2004.01
streaming it's much I just didn't want

2002.0 --> 2005.78
to get involved in it and so Nathan just

2004.01 --> 2006.98
said forget it just leave it and I said

2005.78 --> 2010.22
well why don't you give it to our window

2006.98 --> 2012.89
I wouldn't be the guinea pig goodie I I

2010.22 --> 2013.4
think most people don't hate Nathan most

2012.89 --> 2016.9
bowlers

2013.4 --> 2020.5400000000002
I think every like most bowlers know

2016.9 --> 2023.18
he's just playing a character and why

2020.54 --> 2024.59
should obviously there's a role of

2023.18 --> 2026.66
there's an element of role play in there

2024.59 --> 2028.61
in the game overall but realistically

2026.66 --> 2030.6200000000001
speaking most bowlers if they actually

2028.61 --> 2032.78
speak to Nathan as a normal human not on

2030.62 --> 2034.37
a keyboard actually speak to him he's

2032.78 --> 2036.68
nowhere near is the way he's portrayed

2034.37 --> 2039.7099999999998
is just normal but English doesn't agree

2036.68 --> 2042.29
made straight to an offline or he just

2039.71 --> 2044.03
normal for an eighth as you speak if you

2042.29 --> 2046.6399999999999
speak to him online and the subject of

2044.03 --> 2048.649
the shape of the earth comes up it

2046.64 --> 2051.56
depends like you watch to hand you your

2048.649 --> 2053.12
own ass it depends on how you present

2051.56 --> 2055.73
yourself if you present yourself as this

2053.12 --> 2058.5499999999997
arrogant egotistical like protagonist

2055.73 --> 2060.47
guy like like group if DOS yeah rubiks

2058.55 --> 2062.4190000000003
gonna get his bumps marked but if you're

2060.47 --> 2063.8889999999997
just a minion and you just going on

2062.419 --> 2067.7599999999998
asking general questions and you not

2063.889 --> 2069.32
being multi about your Italian yeah but

2067.76 --> 2071.8990000000003
sometimes you do a lead across the lines

2069.32 --> 2075.53
a little bit at times well especially

2071.899 --> 2077.5099999999998
when you drunk big deal well there are

2075.53 --> 2079.34
limits Armin I don't think it's for

2077.51 --> 2080.6000000000004
being a burnout is limit so I didn't

2079.34 --> 2082.7000000000003
push the limits as much as other people

2080.6 --> 2084.77
they don't know I go I got kicked within

2082.7 --> 2086.8399999999997
minutes it depends on what you mean by

2084.77 --> 2088.399
what what you think what you mean by

2086.84 --> 2090.6490000000003
when you say you didn't push the limits

2088.399 --> 2092.7799999999997
because it's subjective isn't it of

2090.649 --> 2094.129
course it is and that's that's where it

2092.78 --> 2095.84
might just be different because what

2094.129 --> 2099.65
Nathan classes is acceptable might not

2095.84 --> 2101.54
be the same as what you do I think

2099.65 --> 2103.07
anyway I think if any ball that goes on

2101.54 --> 2104.57
and literally talks to him like a normal

2103.07 --> 2106.19
person and doesn't go in there with dick

2104.57 --> 2107.69
swinging you'll be fine

2106.19 --> 2111.77
well the minute you go in and start

2107.69 --> 2113.78
saying things like oh it's I mean look

2111.77 --> 2115.82
the what the worst baller that gets

2113.78 --> 2118.25
treated the worst is obviously rumpus

2115.82 --> 2120.6800000000003
what everybody else gets treated a

2118.25 --> 2122.18
variety of gradients in between now your

2120.68 --> 2123.6499999999996
I would say you're on the bottom end of

2122.18 --> 2125.5499999999997
the bad stuff you know you know we're

2123.65 --> 2128.67
near the bad end of stuff maybe

2125.55 --> 2131.3700000000003
you feel not the same over I don't

2128.67 --> 2133.08
particularly care really yeah but one my

2131.37 --> 2135.63
point is that if you go all over any

2133.08 --> 2137.5499999999997
kind of attitude then these I start with

2135.63 --> 2138.9300000000003
that attitude back well if you go on on

2137.55 --> 2141.51
there and just talk normally and just

2138.93 --> 2143.04
like try and keep my old tone and I

2141.51 --> 2144.9300000000003
don't think he would treat you or

2143.04 --> 2147.06
anybody any different if he would just

2144.93 --> 2148.5299999999997
be normal but balls don't come on that a

2147.06 --> 2151.32
ball does come into religious zealot

2148.53 --> 2152.9700000000003
mode and Layton reacts to it and if

2151.32 --> 2154.01
that's the show isn't it that's the way

2152.97 --> 2161.64
it goes

2154.01 --> 2164.1600000000003
indeed yeah so I'm just answering crazy

2161.64 --> 2166.97
check yesterday on camera I actually

2164.16 --> 2169.68
showed my face to you directly

2166.97 --> 2171.5899999999997
you don't remember bad luck do you guys

2169.68 --> 2176.0099999999998
have trouble hearing me

2171.59 --> 2178.65
yeah all right but is Derrick some kind

2176.01 --> 2181.44
of delayed to you because I try and been

2178.65 --> 2186.9300000000003
trying to interrupt but it's very hard

2181.44 --> 2189.87
to get in between trying to interrupt

2186.93 --> 2191.91
right I didn't okay well I guess I'll

2189.87 --> 2196.14
have to be a little bit more noisy noisy

2191.91 --> 2197.97
and then fix my audio system so yeah

2196.14 --> 2201.15
talked about that audio banana I got to

2197.97 --> 2205.3199999999997
deal with that but I was wondering can't

2201.15 --> 2207.75
Nathan just do his debate live streamed

2205.32 --> 2211.56
through somebody else's channel like

2207.75 --> 2213.84
City through Randy's channel that he

2211.56 --> 2217.38
could literally do the setup and then

2213.84 --> 2219.7200000000003
stream it all exactly as it is normally

2217.38 --> 2224.6400000000003
but through Randy's channel instead of

2219.72 --> 2226.1099999999997
any of his own everybody lines I don't

2224.64 --> 2230.91
think he can do that but I think why not

2226.11 --> 2232.2000000000003
if he is doing it we discussed what we

2230.91 --> 2233.91
should do and how we should do it and we

2232.2 --> 2236.5499999999997
discussed all options and basically I

2233.91 --> 2238.0499999999997
think ultimately it's a short-term loss

2236.55 --> 2239.55
for a long-term gain what he's doing

2238.05 --> 2241.77
because although it creates the

2239.55 --> 2243.69
impression that they've won by doing

2241.77 --> 2248.04
what they're doing it's only gonna be 1

2243.69 --> 2248.76
for 3 day 2 days 3 days 2 days so but in

2248.04 --> 2251.25
that period

2248.76 --> 2253.32
Nexen just said let them think it theirs

2251.25 --> 2255.39
after that it won't be so as far as I'm

2253.32 --> 2257.34
aware he's in control he knows what he's

2255.39 --> 2258.96
doing at least he's just not rising to

2257.34 --> 2259.4100000000003
the bait he's not playing the game he's

2258.96 --> 2260.819
playing

2259.41 --> 2263.549
the YouTube game and that's all he's

2260.819 --> 2266.49
doing all right ante you know once you

2263.549 --> 2269.67
add down a properly or if you've got a

2266.49 --> 2272.4599999999996
play by the legal rule rules you know

2269.67 --> 2274.41
there's no other option and it will

2272.46 --> 2276.809
strengthen him eventually but its pain

2274.41 --> 2277.98
in the ass for a few days but yeah and

2276.809 --> 2279.9900000000002
the best thing is though because

2277.98 --> 2281.5190000000002
everyone now everyone knows I mean

2279.99 --> 2283.019
everyone's got an interpretation of what

2281.519 --> 2284.7889999999998
they think may or may not have happens

2283.019 --> 2286.2299999999996
into himself said that he thought it

2284.789 --> 2289.38
might have been because T bricked Tim

2286.23 --> 2290.7
Tim Osborne with radius well regardless

2289.38 --> 2292.829
of what your input in personally

2290.7 --> 2294.6899999999996
impressions our our interpretations are

2292.829 --> 2296.94
and now that you know that it's the

2294.69 --> 2300.2000000000003
result of a malicious and spurious

2296.94 --> 2302.67
copyright claim from a bloke who

2300.2 --> 2304.98
probably his faceless doesn't haven't

2302.67 --> 2306.809
about fix the ball or whatever and he's

2304.98 --> 2309.48
passing himself off as a music industry

2306.809 --> 2312.2690000000002
person and I don't know who he is or

2309.48 --> 2313.89
what his intentions are but now that you

2312.269 --> 2315.4799999999996
know that it's outside of YouTube it

2313.89 --> 2317.8799999999997
it's literally the case that this guy's

2315.48 --> 2319.859
putting in these copyright strikes for

2317.88 --> 2321.3900000000003
material he's got no right to because

2319.859 --> 2322.98
obviously it's a debate show that's one

2321.39 --> 2325.3489999999997
of Nathan's channel the only thing that

2322.98 --> 2327.75
the nathan plays with the start is that

2325.349 --> 2330.21
initial intro music well that's come

2327.75 --> 2333.0
from fe core so everybody in fe collar

2330.21 --> 2334.4700000000003
is trusted so it's not it's that that's

2333.0 --> 2336.569
not going to be the copyright material

2334.47 --> 2337.769
and if that turned out to be the case

2336.569 --> 2340.5
that obviously there's a Trojan horse

2337.769 --> 2342.779
within Fe core and but it's extremely

2340.5 --> 2345.93
unlikely because we know we would do did

2342.779 --> 2347.67
it but in any event and it's a it's the

2345.93 --> 2349.23
case that there was no copyrighted

2347.67 --> 2351.329
material played and least claimed

2349.23 --> 2354.63
copyright on material that is clearly

2351.329 --> 2358.5890000000004
Nathan's right he only has that one

2354.63 --> 2362.13
sample which is from a movie but it's

2358.589 --> 2365.22
it's just an audio sample it's well with

2362.13 --> 2368.4900000000002
under within a minute so it should be

2365.22 --> 2371.66
perfectly legal to do anything like that

2368.49 --> 2377.1899999999996
it's only when you do over a minute and

2371.66 --> 2378.779
with like very powerful pop song artists

2377.19 --> 2381.0
that kind of thing you can't do anything

2378.779 --> 2382.92
of that unless unless it is to do with

2381.0 --> 2384.569
the intro but the intro as far as I know

2382.92 --> 2388.529
wasn't from a movie it was made

2384.569 --> 2390.39
intro is that true yeah even use one

2388.529 --> 2392.73
minute in an intro

2390.39 --> 2393.1189999999997
no no what saying is the intro if the if

2392.73 --> 2395.069
the

2393.119 --> 2397.279
far as I know the intro was made by a

2395.069 --> 2400.019
guy called Stefan of effort if he call

2397.279 --> 2402.059
that's not accurate then forgive me but

2400.019 --> 2404.249
as far as I understand it it's bespoke I

2402.059 --> 2406.559
don't think he came from a music no I'm

2404.249 --> 2409.89
not talking about the very very you're

2406.559 --> 2415.71
talking about the man max sample lovely

2409.89 --> 2417.9
day thing that's not from yeah that's

2415.71 --> 2420.509
gonna be this it's from another movie I

2417.9 --> 2422.73
think it's from that no no no that's

2420.509 --> 2425.73
replacing where he has to stay jiggery

2422.73 --> 2429.42
to survive you need no extra cost

2425.73 --> 2431.999
you need a secular one that particular

2429.42 --> 2433.4990000000003
sample that he uses so I don't know

2431.999 --> 2435.269
maybe that might have been the problem

2433.499 --> 2436.68
I'm not sure yeah that's only why a

2435.269 --> 2437.9399999999996
second role I don't think that would be

2436.68 --> 2439.9199999999996
covered yeah

2437.94 --> 2442.589
from what I understand none of that's

2439.92 --> 2446.069
the issue it's not a very very different

2442.589 --> 2447.63
thing and um I wouldn't worry guys I

2446.069 --> 2451.349
don't really want to say too much

2447.63 --> 2453.359
Nathan's got it under control he's aware

2451.349 --> 2458.9990000000003
what the issue is there's nothing like

2453.359 --> 2461.19
that it's been dealt with and dealt with

2458.999 --> 2463.019
in the correct manner it's not as we

2461.19 --> 2467.029
said last night it's not a YouTube thing

2463.019 --> 2471.4399999999996
to direct company to YouTube claiming

2467.029 --> 2474.809
it's just a wild claim that's being

2471.44 --> 2481.739
because it's outside of YouTube is it it

2474.809 --> 2483.1800000000003
does have to be enabled so but the

2481.739 --> 2484.619
bottom line is you said it for the next

2483.18 --> 2486.569
two or three days just forget about it

2484.619 --> 2487.9500000000003
for me over a while it's like because

2486.569 --> 2490.079
the day before New Year's Eve is not

2487.95 --> 2491.519
technically a bank holiday but I think

2490.079 --> 2494.549
some people in some parts of the world

2491.519 --> 2496.7389999999996
do use it as one and that they have to

2494.549 --> 2498.5389999999998
do is it day is or is not as well

2496.739 --> 2500.73
depends I'm not sure exactly how it all

2498.539 --> 2502.4100000000003
works but I know that and I know that we

2500.73 --> 2504.66
all have that one common bank holiday

2502.41 --> 2506.19
which is New Year's Day and but I think

2504.66 --> 2507.6299999999997
New Year's Eve some people anyway the

2506.19 --> 2509.489
point is the other skelet and stuffing

2507.63 --> 2511.319
over this period and they can't deal

2509.489 --> 2512.759
with this request immediately because

2511.319 --> 2514.89
the people aren't there to do it so it's

2512.759 --> 2517.92
a case of the timing and it's just up

2514.89 --> 2519.8089999999997
until [ __ ] it's been chosen to have to

2517.92 --> 2522.15
fall over a time when YouTube don't have

2519.809 --> 2523.4100000000003
enough stuffing and that's all it is so

2522.15 --> 2524.94
we're basically he's just said forget it

2523.41 --> 2526.6499999999996
just write it off for two three days

2524.94 --> 2526.9500000000003
spread the word let people know that you

2526.65 --> 2530.369
only

2526.95 --> 2532.9199999999996
so you know it's almost like advanced

2530.369 --> 2538.619
trolling what's basically happening is

2532.92 --> 2540.75
abusing the bureaucracy of YouTube just

2538.619 --> 2544.079
to get in our way for getting in the way

2540.75 --> 2547.77
sake yeah that's yeah it's like advanced

2544.079 --> 2551.2200000000003
trolling yeah it is about trolling

2547.77 --> 2552.93
you're right but you're also have to ask

2551.22 --> 2555.3289999999997
is it actually trolling or is it

2552.93 --> 2558.99
actually YouTube somehow controlling the

2555.329 --> 2561.03
narrative myself Green it's not gonna be

2558.99 --> 2564.1499999999996
YouTube itself but it might be people

2561.03 --> 2567.299
look there's a lot of people working for

2564.15 --> 2570.4500000000003
YouTube and it's widely known that I've

2567.299 --> 2572.0099999999998
been infiltrated by Marxists all over

2570.45 --> 2575.04
the place especially in the moderator

2572.01 --> 2576.98
Department and now we haven't had too

2575.04 --> 2580.829
much trouble with that personally

2576.98 --> 2582.47
because yeah we we don't get into that

2580.829 --> 2586.1090000000004
kind of political area with our

2582.47 --> 2589.3489999999997
discussions mostly but they are there

2586.109 --> 2592.109
and yeah there may be some just wrong

2589.349 --> 2594.2400000000002
Flat Earth sympathizers among them that

2592.109 --> 2596.94
are plotting against us there they might

2594.24 --> 2598.799
not be blocking us directly because

2596.94 --> 2600.9
their bid they've been told not to but

2598.799 --> 2603.78
they may be like hey I have a friend

2600.9 --> 2606.75
here who knows how to screw with

2603.78 --> 2610.8900000000003
channels by copyright striking yeah can

2606.75 --> 2613.2
you get on that guy Spira see cuts his

2610.89 --> 2614.8489999999997
telling people lies in shock he's

2613.2 --> 2615.24
claiming that Anthony agreed with him on

2614.849 --> 2616.829
maths

2615.24 --> 2619.2
Anthony did not agree with you on the

2616.829 --> 2621.809
math stop telling people these lies why

2619.2 --> 2624.0589999999997
are you lying the maths was not agreed

2621.809 --> 2626.19
you misrepresented what it looked like

2624.059 --> 2628.71
on a flat plane I did not agree with

2626.19 --> 2631.559
your maths and when I asked you to prove

2628.71 --> 2633.359
where the photo was taken from and where

2631.559 --> 2636.059
you got your elevation data from from

2633.359 --> 2637.47
the side profile we didn't get it

2636.059 --> 2639.3900000000003
because you've got you told us it was a

2637.47 --> 2641.549
trap and that we shouldn't be asking for

2639.39 --> 2643.0789999999997
it because you can prove it well I'm

2641.549 --> 2645.48
sorry but to go around telling people

2643.079 --> 2648.15
that we agreed with your maths is alike

2645.48 --> 2650.549
and Spira see cats stop lying

2648.15 --> 2653.15
we don't agree with your maths you are

2650.549 --> 2653.15
lying

2653.569 --> 2658.579
and we can't conclude the point because

2655.74 --> 2658.5789999999997
you won't prove your claim

2659.06 --> 2663.38
or when maybe you should pass him a link

2660.92 --> 2667.13
maybe you can join the panel conspiracy

2663.38 --> 2672.17
cats yeah I don't have it why not I

2667.13 --> 2674.63
don't have I might come from him getting

2672.17 --> 2677.51
him in over Skype though I can do that

2674.63 --> 2680.48
as a software channel but that may have

2677.51 --> 2682.3700000000003
escaped when I might be able to do that

2680.48 --> 2685.19
for you if you want to get him in so

2682.37 --> 2686.93
it's that I agreed when I thought he was

2685.19 --> 2689.03
talking about the PCAT not the side peek

2686.93 --> 2691.0099999999998
no I I didn't say that I thought you

2689.03 --> 2694.67
were talking about the side peek I said

2691.01 --> 2696.86
okay peek again you've misrepresented my

2694.67 --> 2701.2400000000002
words you're lying in conspiracy cast

2696.86 --> 2705.7400000000002
something the link was said okay Robin

2701.24 --> 2707.6299999999997
it's your show well if you guys think

2705.74 --> 2709.0699999999997
it's safe look there is a back panel

2707.63 --> 2711.59
option right now

2709.07 --> 2714.94
please don't snipe if you just disagree

2711.59 --> 2718.07
a lot of course but yeah if you guys

2714.94 --> 2719.54
then I don't think you'd be like sure

2718.07 --> 2722.7200000000003
give him the link and just make sure

2719.54 --> 2724.16
it's not thrown out in public please no

2722.72 --> 2728.7799999999997
I want it in public of course not all

2724.16 --> 2731.0
right no problem do it yes yes oh yeah

2728.78 --> 2735.2200000000003
and peanuts Clark may also be joining

2731.0 --> 2739.39
the panel in any any minute now

2735.22 --> 2741.89
what about three miles I'm kidding no he

2739.39 --> 2746.69
couldn't join I couldn't I got him

2741.89 --> 2748.16
blocked it adds to the conversation I

2746.69 --> 2750.65
don't even know why Nathan's got a soft

2748.16 --> 2752.21
spot for him he was bad-mouthing Nathan

2750.65 --> 2755.33
on them what's-his-face his channel last

2752.21 --> 2756.2
night vegan boys calling him a fraud and

2755.33 --> 2758.63
I'm like really

2756.2 --> 2760.7
so Nathan gives you a wide berth and you

2758.63 --> 2765.98
still smoke it in his face yeah why

2760.7 --> 2770.0
would you do that because he can I'm

2765.98 --> 2770.9
done with peat moss yep so am i four at

2770.0 --> 2773.72
a time being

2770.9 --> 2778.1
maybe when he snaps out of his fame mood

2773.72 --> 2780.2
I might consider him treating him like a

2778.1 --> 2783.02
normal person again but for now he seems

2780.2 --> 2785.2999999999997
to just be in crazy mode and he's not

2783.02 --> 2785.96
getting out of it anytime soon um it's

2785.3 --> 2788.75
horrible

2785.96 --> 2789.29
excuse me mr. ma mr. Katz if you can

2788.75 --> 2792.43
hear me

2789.29 --> 2792.43
chickadee school

2796.75 --> 2803.29
all right okay hopefully I've sent you

2799.87 --> 2807.52
the right thing and today I am drunk

2803.29 --> 2810.49
after all right Anthony just really

2807.52 --> 2813.85
quick possession for it just to be sure

2810.49 --> 2816.81
to keep you out of sight when everyone

2813.85 --> 2816.81
can still hear you of course

2816.94 --> 2823.69
just real quick to clarify um you asked

2820.33 --> 2827.38
me please make a video and show a force

2823.69 --> 2828.1
of 150 million one object we can make

2827.38 --> 2832.9300000000003
any pair

2828.1 --> 2837.85
so should I should I really really make

2832.93 --> 2839.95
a Cavendish experiment by myself guesser

2837.85 --> 2842.74
scales pour an apple on the scales and

2839.95 --> 2844.87
then just manipulate that 150 millionth

2842.74 --> 2848.2
of the mass of the Apple to show that it

2844.87 --> 2850.7799999999997
could be done well or just make a

2848.2 --> 2853.33
Cavendish experiment by myself and show

2850.78 --> 2857.6800000000003
you that one 50 millionth of the object

2853.33 --> 2859.18
weights force can't move no because even

2857.68 --> 2860.9199999999996
if you were to repeat the Cavendish

2859.18 --> 2864.85
experiment you've got to manipulate that

2860.92 --> 2866.44
force right this I don't have to

2864.85 --> 2871.39
manipulate that force you just wanted me

2866.44 --> 2875.53
to show you that one in 50 million can

2871.39 --> 2877.21
move an object of its own weight yeah

2875.53 --> 2879.82
but I want it I want to see that it is a

2877.21 --> 2882.2200000000003
50 millionth and I want you to turn the

2879.82 --> 2883.9300000000003
50 millionth on and off and and show

2882.22 --> 2885.85
that you are doing it one fifty

2883.93 --> 2888.49
millionth and not one 50 millionth of

2885.85 --> 2890.65
one or one forty nine millionth 999th

2888.49 --> 2892.24
Wow I mean you want to do it about 50

2890.65 --> 2895.1800000000003
millionth and you've got a manipulate

2892.24 --> 2899.68
that 150 million views how can you even

2895.18 --> 2904.6
do that exactly you if you put that type

2899.68 --> 2905.8599999999997
of scale back to actual distances it

2904.6 --> 2909.43
with matter if you

2905.86 --> 2911.38
that's immeasurably small literally I'm

2909.43 --> 2913.24
gonna peach a good show a non-vegan

2911.38 --> 2914.4700000000003
co-channel you're in full agreement with

2913.24 --> 2916.54
going about the legal name fraud

2914.47 --> 2919.33
question mark Pete I've said many many

2916.54 --> 2920.92
many many many times to you that I agree

2919.33 --> 2922.72
with you on the lake legal name fraud

2920.92 --> 2924.4300000000003
I've said it loads I don't know why you

2922.72 --> 2926.7999999999997
now asking the question you should

2924.43 --> 2929.6499999999996
already know my position all people had

2926.8 --> 2933.5190000000002
to do was take super hats words

2929.65 --> 2937.1800000000003
mark Patrick Marsden no greater inquiry

2933.519 --> 2938.89
done very Weasley M Pete [ __ ] off

2937.18 --> 2942.16
you're an idiot hey you don't deserve a

2938.89 --> 2943.779
life almost no arrest him he's nuts he's

2942.16 --> 2946.48
blocked I don't know why you're still

2943.779 --> 2949.119
seeing him I'm not seeing him in chat so

2946.48 --> 2953.529
he's not gonna be registered register

2949.119 --> 2955.15
love isn't it taking the word of man is

2953.529 --> 2958.42
the reason why we're in this [ __ ] in the

2955.15 --> 2962.89
first place let's see proof not word of

2958.42 --> 2965.259
man Pete it's the number-one rule right

2962.89 --> 2967.5389999999998
there just just really quick um yeah you

2965.259 --> 2968.71
do understand right one and fifty

2967.539 --> 2971.5890000000004
million what this means

2968.71 --> 2978.43
yeah I do understand what this means so

2971.589 --> 2981.099
the weight compared to can do finish the

2978.43 --> 2982.569
sentence yes so the way of the Apple you

2981.099 --> 2984.789
divide that wait let's just call it a

2982.569 --> 2987.759
kilogram right you divide that kilogram

2984.789 --> 2990.19
in 250 million equal slices and the

2987.759 --> 2992.65
weight of that Apple and one slice is

2990.19 --> 2994.4500000000003
enough to make it move but where does

2992.65 --> 2997.059
the 50 million come from so you know

2994.45 --> 2999.43
you've got to divide it no no what why

2997.059 --> 3000.869
50 million do you know it that's what it

2999.43 --> 3003.029
says in Cavendish's paper and he said

3000.869 --> 3004.4700000000003
it's not more than so you don't

3003.029 --> 3006.239
understand what it means

3004.47 --> 3008.39
it seems what do you mean I don't

3006.239 --> 3012.66
understand I'm reading it from the paper

3008.39 --> 3014.609
why they follow the object weight Zinda

3012.66 --> 3017.22
so whatever you interpret that to mean

3014.609 --> 3020.0589999999997
what is the weight the weight the

3017.22 --> 3022.3489999999997
measurement - wait in terms of LD

3020.059 --> 3024.509
mathematically are you talking on of the

3022.349 --> 3026.6400000000003
concepts surely but this weighed in

3024.509 --> 3027.989
terms of the Cavendish experiment well

3026.64 --> 3029.43
are you gonna say you're gonna have to

3027.989 --> 3031.14
talk about little G now because if you

3029.43 --> 3035.16
are little G came after Cavendish you

3031.14 --> 3038.489
didn't come before so what referring to

3035.16 --> 3041.3689999999997
when he says wait all right so the

3038.489 --> 3045.509
netball I'm going explain it so that let

3041.369 --> 3048.69
fall in in terms of the earth that meets

3045.509 --> 3051.539
the weight let's say what the little

3048.69 --> 3056.279
earth weighs 50 million times more than

3051.539 --> 3058.5890000000004
the latter know the force required to

3056.279 --> 3062.4
move the object according the Cavendish

3058.589 --> 3063.54
is very my news it is not more than 50

3062.4 --> 3066.42
150 M

3063.54 --> 3068.75
of them of the objects wait so in this

3066.42 --> 3070.98
inland in Cavendish is the lead ball

3068.75 --> 3073.02
divided by the way to the lead ball

3070.98 --> 3075.2400000000002
divided by fifty million and you've got

3073.02 --> 3077.49
one slice that one slice is the bit that

3075.24 --> 3079.7099999999996
he's measuring no you don't understand

3077.49 --> 3084.0899999999997
the fifty million because it is the

3079.71 --> 3089.73
range from that it's a restoration from

3084.09 --> 3091.26
the left all to the mass of the dummy

3089.73 --> 3093.54
should we get the paper up and you can

3091.26 --> 3096.4500000000003
tell me where we get it wrong all right

3093.54 --> 3102.0
oh and if I screen sure now I'm aware

3096.45 --> 3105.1499999999996
that I do it on that screen so the link

3102.0 --> 3108.81
doesn't get shared all right yeah I'm

3105.15 --> 3111.09
putting you up for presentation mode so

3108.81 --> 3115.79
while you do that Alan do you mind if I

3111.09 --> 3118.02
invite do you know kosher huh he's a

3115.79 --> 3120.75
global that's been working on a few

3118.02 --> 3122.16
different on he's been working on a

3120.75 --> 3126.06
paper and it wants to have a chat with

3122.16 --> 3127.92
you and Anthony there's money for

3126.06 --> 3132.45
sending building keys is trasher across

3127.92 --> 3134.369
ready go that's fine but I'd prefer if

3132.45 --> 3138.2
these people if they actually would do

3134.369 --> 3140.73
want to talk to me yeah are you type

3138.2 --> 3145.95
because that's where I actually get to

3140.73 --> 3149.91
know people I tried the conspiracy cats

3145.95 --> 3151.5299999999997
he hasn't got much battery power left so

3149.91 --> 3153.8999999999996
he and he's out of the house so he can

3151.53 --> 3159.8100000000004
you can't join alright so a sleeping

3153.9 --> 3163.6800000000003
warrior is presenting thank you alright

3159.81 --> 3165.98
so you see my screen Linda yes I can see

3163.68 --> 3165.98
your screen

3180.16 --> 3190.16
all right so now everything should be

3183.099 --> 3194.329
visible a scene isn't mm-hm I can see it

3190.16 --> 3198.529
well the first page of its paper agreed

3194.329 --> 3199.099
uh I actually had never read the paper

3198.529 --> 3200.569
buts

3199.099 --> 3202.19
ah this might be where you're

3200.569 --> 3203.839
misunderstanding lies because you're

3202.19 --> 3205.4
quoting Mason that I don't understand

3203.839 --> 3206.93
what he says in context but you've not

3205.4 --> 3209.029
read it yourself so we'll read it

3206.93 --> 3212.269
together and we'll see who's wrong so

3209.029 --> 3213.5
page two what my page two he describes

3212.269 --> 3215.4799999999996
what he's trying to do in this

3213.5 --> 3217.579
experiment is he's trying to repeat the

3215.48 --> 3219.68
late mr. Mitchell's claim that he could

3217.579 --> 3221.3590000000004
measure the density of the earth now mr.

3219.68 --> 3224.66
Mitchell died before actually doing it

3221.359 --> 3226.7
so Cavendish was taken on his taking on

3224.66 --> 3229.46
his sword and doing it for him in

3226.7 --> 3232.49
posture posthumously posted on post

3229.46 --> 3234.049
death and so basically it says mr.

3232.49 --> 3235.43
Mitchell had preferred to wooden stands

3234.049 --> 3237.65
on which the laden weights were to be

3235.43 --> 3239.359
supported and pushed forwards till they

3237.65 --> 3241.5190000000002
almost came in contact with the case

3239.359 --> 3243.859
what he seems to have intended than to

3241.519 --> 3246.14
move by hand as the force with which the

3243.859 --> 3250.25
balls are attracted by these weights is

3246.14 --> 3255.5589999999997
excessively minut not more than 150

3250.25 --> 3257.539
millionth of the weight period yes it is

3255.559 --> 3259.039
plain that a very magnet disturbing

3257.539 --> 3261.079
force will be sufficient to destroy the

3259.039 --> 3263.2400000000002
success of the experiment so your

3261.079 --> 3265.2200000000003
attention is drawn to this bit as the

3263.24 --> 3268.549
force with which the balls are attracted

3265.22 --> 3271.49
by these weights is excessively minut

3268.549 --> 3274.49
not more than 150 millionth of their

3271.49 --> 3276.5
weight so bad okay and this paper was

3274.49 --> 3277.9399999999996
written and wait wasn't a thing it

3276.5 --> 3280.069
didn't have little G attached to it at

3277.94 --> 3280.759
that point what must you be referring to

3280.069 --> 3283.339
is in there

3280.759 --> 3284.569
he's referring to the lead ball and the

3283.339 --> 3289.75
weight he's not on about the mass of the

3284.569 --> 3294.019
earth would you agree no the D weight

3289.75 --> 3297.049
will refers to the ratio between the

3294.019 --> 3299.75
flat balls or whatever to the earth

3297.049 --> 3302.529
because when they are talking about

3299.75 --> 3306.349
weight oh then they you've got it wrong

3302.529 --> 3308.059
no I got it right no talking between the

3306.349 --> 3309.799
two the weights in the in the experiment

3308.059 --> 3311.84
not the earth the weights in the

3309.799 --> 3318.41
experiment hello

3311.84 --> 3321.92
Ferro Lang by these weights right

3318.41 --> 3326.7799999999997
like not more than 150 millions of their

3321.92 --> 3328.76
weight so what is their weight there

3326.78 --> 3329.8700000000003
refers to the balls and the weight in

3328.76 --> 3333.0200000000004
the in the experiment

3329.87 --> 3335.66
yeah his weight is before big G was

3333.02 --> 3337.52
calculated so little G didn't exist so

3335.66 --> 3339.7999999999997
we can only be referring to the mass of

3337.52 --> 3341.54
the object the weight and all that in

3339.8 --> 3343.6400000000003
mathematics massive weight a difference

3341.54 --> 3345.44
mass is not a force weight is a force

3343.64 --> 3348.5
but weight hadn't been invented yet

3345.44 --> 3350.15
weight came after this in maths so we

3348.5 --> 3353.3
can only be talking about the mass of

3350.15 --> 3357.98
the object and he's calling it wait no

3353.3 --> 3361.4900000000002
no no des des let fall the the second

3357.98 --> 3366.32
time they talked about weight after the

3361.49 --> 3369.35
150 million they talked about the actual

3366.32 --> 3377.6000000000004
weight of the platform yeah which means

3369.35 --> 3380.45
that weight is result of mass attracting

3377.6 --> 3382.73
mass in terms of this paper this means

3380.45 --> 3386.48
which which must attracting which was

3382.73 --> 3389.12
the Earth's mass attracting the lead

3386.48 --> 3393.56
balls mass in compared to the net ball

3389.12 --> 3396.5899999999997
mass Earth's mass was canceled by it

3393.56 --> 3398.72
being a suspense ocean bar that negated

3396.59 --> 3400.88
the Earth's mass cinder the mass he's

3398.72 --> 3402.7999999999997
talking about is the lead ball and the

3400.88 --> 3404.48
weight that he moves towards it in the

3402.8 --> 3407.36
experiment that's what he's talking

3404.48 --> 3408.92
about cinder you've misunderstood no you

3407.36 --> 3412.7000000000003
misunderstood they are talking about the

3408.92 --> 3418.16
ratio between the weight actual weight

3412.7 --> 3420.89
and the force that was needed to attract

3418.16 --> 3422.39
them horizontally towards each other

3420.89 --> 3426.29
you just flip-flopped he said it was the

3422.39 --> 3430.2999999999997
earth a minute ago I said it again it

3426.29 --> 3434.63
was the ratio between the earth

3430.3 --> 3437.9
attracting the let fall and delayed fall

3434.63 --> 3443.12
attracting each other and the that's no

3437.9 --> 3444.56
is that all or maybe I misspoke or maybe

3443.12 --> 3445.67
you misunderstood I don't know but I say

3444.56 --> 3448.549
it again

3445.67 --> 3453.38
so delayed ball attracting each other

3448.549 --> 3456.77
their force is 50 million times weaker

3453.38 --> 3462.9500000000003
than the earth attracting the let ball

3456.77 --> 3465.29
no that's not what he says again as the

3462.95 --> 3467.24
force with which the balls are attracted

3465.29 --> 3470.089
by these weights is excessively minut

3467.24 --> 3472.609
not more than 150 millionth that ratio

3470.089 --> 3475.3089999999997
is the same ratio as what the earth

3472.609 --> 3476.869
would be attracting any objects to it or

3475.309 --> 3479.5690000000004
because he's got them suspended on a

3476.869 --> 3482.329
torsion bar that value has to be zero

3479.569 --> 3485.21
Cinda so that one 50 millionth relates

3482.329 --> 3487.309
to the the balls and the weights equally

3485.21 --> 3489.71
as it does to the earth and any object

3487.309 --> 3492.7900000000004
on it so we could cross-reference that

3489.71 --> 3495.17
ratio to any gravitational force and

3492.79 --> 3497.72
concentrate on the bit where he says not

3495.17 --> 3500.1800000000003
more than 150 million that's the upper

3497.72 --> 3501.589
limit so my quest to you was to how

3500.18 --> 3503.7799999999997
would you demonstrate that you could

3501.589 --> 3506.0299999999997
measure the weight of an object and only

3503.78 --> 3508.7900000000004
manipulate 150 million and I'll say it

3506.03 --> 3511.099
now not more than 150 millions of the

3508.79 --> 3512.45
objects mass only manipulate that little

3511.099 --> 3514.01
bit because that's the bit that's

3512.45 --> 3515.8289999999997
attributed to gravity according to

3514.01 --> 3518.599
Cavendish no that's where you

3515.829 --> 3531.079
misunderstood again because they are

3518.599 --> 3537.4700000000003
talking about with with after ways they

3531.079 --> 3539.9
mean the D mass of the last balls in

3537.47 --> 3542.7799999999997
reference to the mass of the earth this

3539.9 --> 3544.52
is wait no no no you've misunderstood

3542.78 --> 3546.3190000000004
again this is the point you're saying

3544.52 --> 3549.109
I'm misunderstanding and you're not

3546.319 --> 3551.39
applying what it says it says the force

3549.109 --> 3553.549
with which the balls are attracted by

3551.39 --> 3557.27
these weights nothing to do with earth

3553.549 --> 3559.13
balls of weights is excessively my

3557.27 --> 3561.95
Newton it's not more than a 50 millionth

3559.13 --> 3563.78
because he's got them suspended so any

3561.95 --> 3565.7599999999998
gravitational pull from the earth would

3563.78 --> 3567.349
be zero because he's put you've gotten

3565.76 --> 3569.9300000000003
suspended from a torsion bar on a string

3567.349 --> 3571.94
so you're wrong he's talking about that

3569.93 --> 3574.1299999999997
ratio relative to the balls and the

3571.94 --> 3576.079
weights but you're saying that it's two

3574.13 --> 3577.67
got somewhat to do with the earth no the

3576.079 --> 3579.559
earth value is a zero because it's a

3577.67 --> 3583.029
control he's got it suspended on

3579.559 --> 3583.029
up from the ceiling or not stringing I

3583.239 --> 3589.9990000000003
think you just don't understand I think

3586.059 --> 3591.8900000000003
I can't I can't put it another way what

3589.999 --> 3597.069
I just told you five times in a row

3591.89 --> 3600.17
maybe I can show you got it wrong

3597.069 --> 3602.449
all right let's why don't you ask a

3600.17 --> 3606.17
physicist or so let's why don't you talk

3602.449 --> 3607.819
with a person who actually studies those

3606.17 --> 3609.439
things I could help you can basic

3607.819 --> 3612.229
English I understand what the paper is

3609.439 --> 3614.66
telling me no you don't maybe you should

3612.229 --> 3617.089
speak to a physicist you don't

3614.66 --> 3619.489
understand it you should just showed me

3617.089 --> 3621.709
like ten minutes in a row that you don't

3619.489 --> 3624.799
understand what the 1 and 50 millions

3621.709 --> 3628.069
means it says it in black and white the

3624.799 --> 3630.14
force with which the balls are attracted

3628.069 --> 3632.689
to the weights nothing to do with the

3630.14 --> 3635.839
earth rose in de balls weights balls

3632.689 --> 3639.2889999999998
weights you get it let me let me show

3635.839 --> 3640.91
you the Wikipedia article where he kind

3639.289 --> 3645.429
they kind of say the same thing but I

3640.91 --> 3647.569
just think they formally did the whites

3645.429 --> 3653.929
the weights that he moves towards the

3647.569 --> 3656.239
balls so the force involved in twisting

3653.929 --> 3661.9390000000003
that's whoreson violence was very small

3656.239 --> 3663.949
and then they're like 1.7 4 times 10 the

3661.939 --> 3669.14
minus sir right you know the number

3663.949 --> 3673.279
right of Newton's which is 1 in 50

3669.14 --> 3679.969
million of the weight of the weight of

3673.279 --> 3685.219
the small balls so the force is 1 in 50

3679.969 --> 3688.189
million compared to the weight of the

3685.219 --> 3689.989
small balls what is the weight of the

3688.189 --> 3696.2889999999998
small balls the weight of the small

3689.989 --> 3698.179
balls is the ratio from the mass of the

3696.289 --> 3701.779
small balls to the earth

3698.179 --> 3704.6890000000003
no but this came before it can be small

3701.779 --> 3706.429
the definition of weight the definition

3704.689 --> 3709.0989999999997
of weight mathematically came after this

3706.429 --> 3711.0190000000002
didn't it little G remember that's word

3709.099 --> 3712.8500000000004
little disk cut this whole experiment

3711.019 --> 3715.3399999999997
derived the

3712.85 --> 3716.06
the the quantification for big G so

3715.34 --> 3718.28
we're told

3716.06 --> 3719.84
so if you didn't have big G before how

3718.28 --> 3725.9
could you have had little G to now claim

3719.84 --> 3732.58
you can't so you you say like Newton for

3725.9 --> 3735.4100000000003
example he left after in the 1800s

3732.58 --> 3737.09
actually you're calling weight now is

3735.41 --> 3738.62
not what he called weight back then

3737.09 --> 3740.48
because weight back then didn't have

3738.62 --> 3741.92
little G attached to it he was using

3740.48 --> 3744.41
weight in the context of what we

3741.92 --> 3746.09
normally call mass and you're saying is

3744.41 --> 3747.44
no no we add little G attached to it

3746.09 --> 3747.8
that's the gravitational pull of the

3747.44 --> 3750.14
earth

3747.8 --> 3752.21
no it wasn't invented until after that

3750.14 --> 3754.58
was it it's a mathematical construct

3752.21 --> 3755.71
that came from that paper apparently as

3754.58 --> 3760.97
we're told

3755.71 --> 3763.94
they still knew how to weigh things you

3760.97 --> 3766.4199999999996
know they didn't need to know how you

3763.94 --> 3769.37
know they didn't they didn't meet well

3766.42 --> 3771.23
numbers are but they knew you out away

3769.37 --> 3773.3599999999997
things and then knew how to compare the

3771.23 --> 3775.79
force yeah it's so it's deduction based

3773.36 --> 3777.71
all of it so that you know it's

3775.79 --> 3779.48
retrospective application of little G

3777.71 --> 3781.1
when it didn't even exist and you can't

3779.48 --> 3783.95
use little G back then when it hadn't

3781.1 --> 3786.2
been invented mathematically until after

3783.95 --> 3788.54
that this paper was where little G was

3786.2 --> 3790.1
eventually derived from well you can't

3788.54 --> 3791.81
use little G before the experiment

3790.1 --> 3793.97
because this is the experiment that

3791.81 --> 3799.19
supposed to have established it that's a

3793.97 --> 3801.7999999999997
very good point you can't have the the

3799.19 --> 3804.68
thing you're trying to prove as part of

3801.8 --> 3807.1400000000003
the formula for trying to prove it that

3804.68 --> 3810.74
is circular reasoning that's a

3807.14 --> 3813.0499999999997
submissive R which is the same

3810.74 --> 3814.9399999999996
application of the same issue with 7/6

3813.05 --> 3817.82
are you cannot put the radius in there

3814.94 --> 3821.9900000000002
if you try to prove the radius so what

3817.82 --> 3824.06
let's just go back for a moment do we do

3821.99 --> 3826.4599999999996
you agree with me that before the

3824.06 --> 3831.77
Cavendish experiments they were able to

3826.46 --> 3834.7400000000002
weigh things yeah yes and with their

3831.77 --> 3838.7
equipment they were able to compare the

3834.74 --> 3841.1299999999997
force that is required to pull down a

3838.7 --> 3845.0899999999997
lead ball to the force that is required

3841.13 --> 3846.559
to to make them go closer together in

3845.09 --> 3850.099
the Cavendish experiment

3846.559 --> 3856.67
no that's way more know that they've

3850.099 --> 3858.289
never come from right the experiment

3856.67 --> 3860.119
that's where he quantified it so you

3858.289 --> 3861.5890000000004
can't claim it before and when he cut

3860.119 --> 3863.2690000000002
when he cites them for the phrase wait

3861.589 --> 3865.16
because before the experiment wait

3863.269 --> 3866.8089999999997
didn't have little G attached to it so

3865.16 --> 3867.17
it had nothing to do with and even if it

3866.809 --> 3868.849
did

3867.17 --> 3870.7690000000002
he's negated it by suspending the

3868.849 --> 3873.2000000000003
torsion bar from the ceiling that zebra

3870.769 --> 3874.7
that balance is zero so even if you're

3873.2 --> 3876.5589999999997
right it still doesn't apply because

3874.7 --> 3880.3089999999997
it's a control in this experiment it's

3876.559 --> 3883.46
not a variable forget for forget G

3880.309 --> 3887.4500000000003
forget everything forget everything you

3883.46 --> 3889.48
know no just hold on guys I want to I

3887.45 --> 3891.529
want to break in this is my damn show

3889.48 --> 3893.2690000000002
especially it's a good discussion but I

3891.529 --> 3894.589
want to break in and I need to do that

3893.269 --> 3895.5789999999997
noise and the otherwise you're not gonna

3894.589 --> 3898.7
hear me apparently

3895.579 --> 3902.7200000000003
so yeah the thing that we can actually

3898.7 --> 3904.7
measure as humans is the weight but what

3902.72 --> 3907.779
is the weight that's the whole problem

3904.7 --> 3911.089
that wears this weight coming from why

3907.779 --> 3913.4
does it what is causing the weight and

3911.089 --> 3916.069
that's the biggest problem that's where

3913.4 --> 3919.1600000000003
the little G has been invented for to

3916.069 --> 3922.39
give a cause to this correct way and end

3919.16 --> 3927.41
in a company with this stable factor

3922.39 --> 3930.109
that can be deduced deduced only as mass

3927.41 --> 3932.69
and that is part of the fundamental

3930.109 --> 3936.17
problem of the entire thing weight is a

3932.69 --> 3939.109
thing that we can measure and based on a

3936.17 --> 3942.17
deduction of these weight measurements

3939.109 --> 3945.0789999999997
is where we invented mass is where we

3942.17 --> 3949.069
invented little G to give a causal

3945.079 --> 3951.5890000000004
relation structure to this original way

3949.069 --> 3957.529
of measuring things I agree with Alvin

3951.589 --> 3961.069
completely yeah so you don't need to

3957.529 --> 3964.91
know right you don't need to know what

3961.069 --> 3968.45
exactly little G is in terms to find out

3964.91 --> 3973.839
that the force required we know what

3968.45 --> 3977.509
little G is it is the deduced constant

3973.839 --> 3979.73
it was just to make my point to Riley

3977.509 --> 3982.7
that it doesn't matter

3979.73 --> 3986.109
if what we know about little gee if we

3982.7 --> 3989.2999999999997
have the equipment to measure the force

3986.109 --> 3993.16
difference of pulling a lead ball

3989.3 --> 4000.599
towards the earth and letting them pull

3993.16 --> 4003.79
towards each other what about little G

4000.599 --> 4006.13
everything about little G the problem is

4003.79 --> 4010.27
is when you start to assume that it is

4006.13 --> 4012.82
an actual thing it is only a deduction

4010.27 --> 4016.45
based formula it is a deduction based

4012.82 --> 4019.15
concept based on weight measurements and

4016.45 --> 4021.1299999999997
it is when you start to convince

4019.15 --> 4025.39
yourself that because there seems to be

4021.13 --> 4029.5
a uniform number and uniform for a

4025.39 --> 4032.3489999999997
formula easily being derived from these

4029.5 --> 4035.14
measurements that it must be a thing and

4032.349 --> 4038.2000000000003
now that is declaring an aberration for

4035.14 --> 4042.1189999999997
an actual provable thing and there lies

4038.2 --> 4042.1189999999997
the problem it's a psychological problem

4042.21 --> 4047.5
um

4043.869 --> 4049.15
so the let's go in terms of relative

4047.5 --> 4050.079
density all right maybe you understand

4049.15 --> 4054.819
um

4050.079 --> 4059.369
the effect of relative density making

4054.819 --> 4065.92
the lead fall going towards the earth

4059.369 --> 4070.27
the apparent force is 50 million times

4065.92 --> 4073.119
stronger than D I don't know that the

4070.27 --> 4075.73
whatever electromagnetism that pulled

4073.119 --> 4078.2200000000003
the lead ball together or whatever you

4075.73 --> 4084.79
flipped it it's 150 millionth of the

4078.22 --> 4087.0989999999997
object no it is 50 million times

4084.79 --> 4089.349
stronger than the thing that made the

4087.099 --> 4091.089
blade wall port go together just so you

4089.349 --> 4094.2400000000002
understand where the 50 million comes

4091.089 --> 4096.25
from then we can refer the understands

4094.24 --> 4098.0199999999995
the 50 million comes from the object's

4096.25 --> 4099.489
weight it clearly says it in the paper

4098.02 --> 4105.339000000001
it doesn't come from anywhere else you

4099.489 --> 4106.75
can't change it described I thought

4105.339 --> 4108.6
maybe you all can understand it better

4106.75 --> 4111.25
when I put it that way it doesn't seem

4108.6 --> 4112.859
so doesn't matter anyway

4111.25 --> 4116.04
I'm going to explain it to you

4112.859 --> 4117.259
all the time at this time no we're time

4116.04 --> 4122.159
the show can go on

4117.259 --> 4124.44
for at least another 40 minutes so yeah

4122.159 --> 4125.94
we've got 20 times into let's not wait I

4124.44 --> 4127.3189999999995
want you guys just to slow down real

4125.94 --> 4131.73
quick because it's very interesting that

4127.319 --> 4133.049
that cinder thinks that that we don't

4131.73 --> 4138.239
understand what he's saying

4133.049 --> 4141.509
yeah no no no he does there's just a

4138.239 --> 4144.3589999999995
slight misunderstanding from both sides

4141.509 --> 4149.489
no no no he knows in there we don't

4144.359 --> 4150.63
close very close to no Travis is right

4149.489 --> 4151.739
is in the things that we don't

4150.63 --> 4156.679
understand what he's saying

4151.739 --> 4161.879999999999
do you um

4156.679 --> 4164.13
well maybe you understand it but I don't

4161.88 --> 4166.29
see where the issue is then if you

4164.13 --> 4168.06
understand us because you're using the

4166.29 --> 4169.469
word wait in the context of what we

4168.06 --> 4171.659000000001
currently understand wait to mean

4169.469 --> 4173.04
according to your science let me just

4171.659 --> 4175.83
let me just jump in real quick because

4173.04 --> 4178.5
cinder says maybe if I say it this way

4175.83 --> 4182.1
or he says I've said it to you five

4178.5 --> 4186.029
times so clearly he thinks that there is

4182.1 --> 4187.38
a breakdown in communication and and the

4186.029 --> 4188.7300000000005
thing is this is the way I'm

4187.38 --> 4192.2390000000005
interpreting this is the way I'm

4188.73 --> 4194.2789999999995
interpreting it right now we don't we we

4192.239 --> 4195.299999999999
don't agree with cinder so he thinks we

4194.279 --> 4197.790000000001
don't understand what he's saying

4195.3 --> 4200.88
correct if we did understand we would

4197.79 --> 4203.25
agree with him no this is the reason why

4200.88 --> 4207.54
I put it the way with relative density

4203.25 --> 4210.179
without needing the weights right

4207.54 --> 4211.05
because I try to put it in your

4210.179 --> 4213.75
perspective

4211.05 --> 4218.1900000000005
so why don't you guys answer me then

4213.75 --> 4220.86
what is the one in 50 million what does

4218.19 --> 4225.33
it mean it doesn't mean anything it's a

4220.86 --> 4227.909
theoretical concept to be proven no no

4225.33 --> 4230.85
the 150 million means it's that it's the

4227.909 --> 4233.3099999999995
quantified value for the force required

4230.85 --> 4236.13
to make the object move according to

4233.31 --> 4238.639
this paper exactly and it's no rough of

4236.13 --> 4243.06
that that there's actually there it is a

4238.639 --> 4245.63
presupposition or part of reasoning it's

4243.06 --> 4248.910000000001
not that's a theory

4245.63 --> 4251.39
so what the lunch you're gone so you

4248.91 --> 4254.639999999999
tell us how you think it's reasonable to

4251.39 --> 4256.2300000000005
quantify something to the value of 50

4254.64 --> 4258.75
million to one and it's not more than

4256.23 --> 4260.339999999999
that's the upper limit and then you

4258.75 --> 4263.01
claim that it's a force that's required

4260.34 --> 4264.900000000001
to move something I say that's [ __ ]

4263.01 --> 4267.21
and I ask for any evidence to support

4264.9 --> 4269.5199999999995
something where a 50 millionth of an

4267.21 --> 4270.33
object's mass has ever been used to make

4269.52 --> 4272.370000000001
an object move

4270.33 --> 4274.32
that's like towing a car if you told a

4272.37 --> 4276.09
car and the car weighed one ton and then

4274.32 --> 4277.86
you apply the towing force of a 50

4276.09 --> 4281.46
millionth of a ton do you realistically

4277.86 --> 4284.87
think that that cars gonna move maybe

4281.46 --> 4289.46
maybe if you have a giant and it works

4284.87 --> 4289.46
the thing is the Cavendish experiment

4292.73 --> 4302.009999999999
there was almost zero friction to to

4298.38 --> 4302.49
make those LED balls gonna not a valid

4302.01 --> 4305.31
point

4302.49 --> 4307.62
so I asked you again can you weigh an

4305.31 --> 4309.360000000001
object like say an apple and then

4307.62 --> 4311.34
demonstrate that you can manipulate the

4309.36 --> 4314.219999999999
breath the relative force required to

4311.34 --> 4316.41
show a variation on the scales of a 50

4314.22 --> 4317.54
millionth to one and I bet you can't do

4316.41 --> 4321.21
it

4317.54 --> 4325.08
I'm going your challenge me I'm going to

4321.21 --> 4327.09
the way the text I'm sure I want to see

4325.08 --> 4329.28
it vary from forty nine nine and a nine

4327.09 --> 4331.2300000000005
to fifty forty nine and I want you to be

4329.28 --> 4333.599999999999
the thing that causes that I don't know

4331.23 --> 4335.4
induced I don't want it to be deduced on

4333.6 --> 4337.740000000001
it to be caused that's what science is

4335.4 --> 4340.41
caused an effect so you've got a very

4337.74 --> 4341.82
that one fifty millionth on and off on

4340.41 --> 4343.95
and off and you've got to be the cause

4341.82 --> 4347.429999999999
if you do that I'll accept all except

4343.95 --> 4348.24
gravity all right now you know what the

4347.43 --> 4350.9400000000005
problem is

4348.24 --> 4353.91
I don't know the weight of the net fall

4350.94 --> 4357.69
so I don't I can't say any weight ratio

4353.91 --> 4363.08
doesn't read am sense how could one

4357.69 --> 4366.99
fifty millionth of the the assumed

4363.08 --> 4370.68
gravity force even have any kind of

4366.99 --> 4373.65
influence practically because the thing

4370.68 --> 4375.6900000000005
with forces is it needs a certain to

4373.65 --> 4376.69
reach a certain critical mass in order

4375.69 --> 4378.639999999999
to have any

4376.69 --> 4380.32
kind of influence or the matter will

4378.64 --> 4384.96
absorb it yeah

4380.32 --> 4387.79
there will be no force it hurts no force

4384.96 --> 4390.58
because it will all be absorbed and

4387.79 --> 4395.89
resolved without motion that's the issue

4390.58 --> 4398.7699999999995
so 150 million okay it is 150 millionth

4395.89 --> 4402.64
of gravity force assume gravity force

4398.77 --> 4408.01
even enough to move anything beyond

4402.64 --> 4411.610000000001
maybe the tiniest particle of dust it

4408.01 --> 4414.37
works you're like alright look you have

4411.61 --> 4418.389999999999
those two objects trying to pull each

4414.37 --> 4424.51
other right but they have their force

4418.39 --> 4425.71
can be described as one force if the

4424.51 --> 4427.4800000000005
trial apology do you have to show that

4425.71 --> 4429.52
they exist you can't call it one that

4427.48 --> 4432.009999999999
gives it a presence you have to show

4429.52 --> 4436.09
that it exists exactly first prove it

4432.01 --> 4439.5
that the theory is is is true by proving

4436.09 --> 4443.41
that there is actual force being applied

4439.5 --> 4445.84
causing motion correct yeah so prove

4443.41 --> 4450.82
that it is there it's a theory now prove

4445.84 --> 4452.08
that it is actually there oh if you're

4450.82 --> 4453.16
gonna claim that there's a net force

4452.08 --> 4455.11
you've got to show that there's two

4453.16 --> 4457.57
countering forces that happen to equal

4455.11 --> 4459.3099999999995
zero or one whichever you take but you

4457.57 --> 4461.44
can't say there's a force there and it's

4459.31 --> 4462.79
net if there's no force because we when

4461.44 --> 4464.589999999999
we said well where's the force and you

4462.79 --> 4466.33
say well it's net force so it's you're

4464.59 --> 4467.650000000001
not going to see it well we also say

4466.33 --> 4473.38
well the net force of zero is actually

4467.65 --> 4475.449
zero so it should that should I do it

4473.38 --> 4477.400000000001
with outlets because then people can say

4475.449 --> 4485.799999999999
alright at this electromagnetism are so

4477.4 --> 4491.3099999999995
let's this two isn't high enough I think

4485.8 --> 4495.6
to overcome the friction required

4491.31 --> 4499.150000000001
hold on Reilly agender if I make good

4495.6 --> 4502.75
before you actually try to physically

4499.15 --> 4506.0199999999995
prove this why don't you theoretically

4502.75 --> 4507.969
prove it first get into the laws of

4506.02 --> 4509.179
motion forces how that works what

4507.969 --> 4511.03
critical mass

4509.179 --> 4514.88
is required for a force to actually

4511.03 --> 4517.4
motion wise effect and objects and then

4514.88 --> 4521.36
figure out a setup that could

4517.4 --> 4525.499
theoretically prove with the no

4521.36 --> 4527.539
knowledge about forces your theory first

4525.499 --> 4529.489
try to see if you can basically find a

4527.539 --> 4531.86
model and once you found that

4529.489 --> 4534.949
theoretical model set up for that

4531.86 --> 4537.228999999999
experiment to engage present it and then

4534.949 --> 4541.009999999999
know maybe then you could suggest

4537.229 --> 4545.869000000001
actually physically doing it but first

4541.01 --> 4549.17
try to overcome that that force ya

4545.869 --> 4551.539
problem testimony to actually be able to

4549.17 --> 4553.78
move saying is calculate the inertia

4551.539 --> 4556.429
required to make the object move exactly

4553.78 --> 4558.018999999999
manipulate that that whatever that force

4556.429 --> 4560.059
is the even that you need to make the

4558.019 --> 4562.039000000001
object overcome the inertia then

4560.059 --> 4563.539
demonstrate that one fifty millionth is

4562.039 --> 4565.489
enough to make it move compared to the

4563.539 --> 4566.688999999999
fifty millionth less that doesn't and

4565.489 --> 4570.289
then that's the point you've got to

4566.689 --> 4574.070000000001
prove you know writer do you think it is

4570.289 --> 4578.509999999999
a problem that the 50 million that is

4574.07 --> 4581.869
pulling it down is 50 million stronger

4578.51 --> 4586.55
than the thing pulling them together do

4581.869 --> 4589.938999999999
you think it is because the 50 million

4586.55 --> 4594.53
times stronger force is not that strong

4589.939 --> 4597.530000000001
so if it 150 million try to figure out

4594.53 --> 4602.15
how 150 millionth of the gravity force

4597.53 --> 4603.829
can move anything you assume you've

4602.15 --> 4605.209
assumed Darwin but with your answer

4603.829 --> 4606.889
you've assumed that there is a counter

4605.209 --> 4608.78
force that it's it's stronger than which

4606.889 --> 4610.849
was this question I'm saying there's no

4608.78 --> 4613.369
counter force that's not relevant to

4610.849 --> 4615.349
this case it is because its frame with

4613.369 --> 4617.509999999999
no let-up oh no it has nothing to do

4615.349 --> 4619.6990000000005
with the relative density theory rocking

4617.51 --> 4623.900000000001
motion we're talking about motion he

4619.699 --> 4625.669999999999
asked the question again oh excuse me

4623.9 --> 4626.539
don't shush me we're not on the flares

4625.67 --> 4628.55
debates here

4626.539 --> 4631.699
you've missed it in question the

4628.55 --> 4634.4890000000005
asteroids Anthony Zinda asked the

4631.699 --> 4638.919999999999
question that you asked again do you

4634.489 --> 4642.7699999999995
like do you think is a problem that the

4638.92 --> 4646.85
defame 15 you think poorly

4642.77 --> 4650.570000000001
the let balls down is 50 million times

4646.85 --> 4653.240000000001
stronger than the thing smiling so my

4650.57 --> 4655.099999999999
answer is all together my answer is what

4653.24 --> 4657.83
thing can you prove that thing that

4655.1 --> 4658.9400000000005
you're citing Darwin just answered can

4657.83 --> 4662.36
you prove that thing that you're

4658.94 --> 4664.94
claiming is there in the first place

4662.36 --> 4667.099999999999
let's assume it is I don't know it's not

4664.94 --> 4671.21
a street intensity no no assumptions

4667.1 --> 4671.660000000001
it's a direct question yes that it

4671.21 --> 4673.88
exists

4671.66 --> 4678.139999999999
yes that's what we're asking you can you

4673.88 --> 4683.05
prove that bit by letting move the lead

4678.14 --> 4685.490000000001
balls together with in regards of

4683.05 --> 4688.54
cancelling out anything else can single

4685.49 --> 4691.67
out electromagnetism consume out wind

4688.54 --> 4694.25
anything that could disturb it then I

4691.67 --> 4696.95
can see those let ball move together I'm

4694.25 --> 4699.53
not talking about seeing I'm I'm in the

4696.95 --> 4703.16
first place talking about if it is even

4699.53 --> 4706.849999999999
theoretically possible for that to occur

4703.16 --> 4709.46
naturally that's what I'm asking one

4706.85 --> 4712.21
fifty millionth of the supposed gravity

4709.46 --> 4717.59
force is that even theoretically

4712.21 --> 4721.0
possible for that to move something to

4717.59 --> 4724.28
build up enough force momentum to

4721.0 --> 4726.59
actually cause motion in the object and

4724.28 --> 4730.28
not by seeing it but if it is it

4726.59 --> 4732.32
measurably possible calculable just

4730.28 --> 4735.8
saying the one in 50 million isn't the

4732.32 --> 4737.599999999999
thing that pulls things down it isn't

4735.8 --> 4744.59
the thing that holds the oceans to the

4737.6 --> 4746.780000000001
earth case you didn't understand it

4744.59 --> 4748.85
right by saying it is you didn't

4746.78 --> 4751.4
understand what if 150 million me no I

4748.85 --> 4754.58
do understand it 150 million you mean

4751.4 --> 4759.65
hold on hold on 150 millions means is

4754.58 --> 4762.23
the presumed force of an object pulling

4759.65 --> 4764.929999999999
other objects because of its inherent

4762.23 --> 4768.169999999999
weight its inherent mass which is

4764.93 --> 4770.51
theorized to cause gravity compared to

4768.17 --> 4775.96
the weight of the entire earth that is

4770.51 --> 4777.400000000001
what the 50 million is about I I said

4775.96 --> 4779.17
I said it to Anthony that I didn't

4777.4 --> 4781.719
understand you understood it

4779.17 --> 4783.16
gained it to me your poutier said what

4781.719 --> 4785.7300000000005
you said was that gravity is not the

4783.16 --> 4790.05
thing that holds the oceans on the earth

4785.73 --> 4793.95
I didn't say that we said what he said I

4790.05 --> 4798.13
said that the one in 50 million isn't

4793.95 --> 4800.139999999999
the force holding the oceans to the

4798.13 --> 4801.67
earth isn't the for holding the moon to

4800.14 --> 4802.780000000001
the earth it isn't that one in 50

4801.67 --> 4805.78
million stop there

4802.78 --> 4808.03
gravity is quantified by cavendish as

4805.78 --> 4813.3099999999995
150 millionth of the object's weight and

4808.03 --> 4815.98
grow it it is it is know is crazy thing

4813.31 --> 4818.2300000000005
that sticks war to a ball so where isn't

4815.98 --> 4819.73
right so how are you gonna contrast what

4818.23 --> 4821.65
the gravity is compared to what the

4819.73 --> 4823.54
claim of gravity does which is that it

4821.65 --> 4826.15
holds the oceans on where we get in this

4823.54 --> 4829.09
wrong gear the one in 50 million isn't

4826.15 --> 4834.67
what gravity is Anthony so what is

4829.09 --> 4838.68
gravity then all right Dee I can explain

4834.67 --> 4842.2300000000005
first of the one in 50 million is the

4838.68 --> 4844.27
comparison of the gravitational pull of

4842.23 --> 4847.468999999999
the earth to the gravitational pull of

4844.27 --> 4852.160000000001
the LED ball between each other

4847.469 --> 4854.11
gravity is I don't know what it is I I

4852.16 --> 4855.43
couldn't go with Einstein I could go

4854.11 --> 4857.11
with Newton but I don't know what

4855.43 --> 4859.42
gravity is I'm sorry I

4857.11 --> 4861.58
Cavendish states clearly the most

4859.42 --> 4863.95
required to make the objects move the

4861.58 --> 4866.05
weight in the balls move is 150

4863.95 --> 4868.03
millionth of its weight that is supposed

4866.05 --> 4869.56
to be what gravity is now you're saying

4868.03 --> 4871.87
that that's not the thing that keeps the

4869.56 --> 4873.820000000001
waters to the ohm on the edge of the

4871.87 --> 4876.969
ball and I'm saying that Cavendish says

4873.82 --> 4880.54
that it is not the thing keeping the

4876.969 --> 4883.4800000000005
oceans toward the earth is D 50 million

4880.54 --> 4885.61
not 1 in 50 million is to 50 million to

4883.48 --> 4889.36
1 that would be the density wouldn't it

4885.61 --> 4891.339999999999
sir no what yeah so what's the other if

4889.36 --> 4893.7699999999995
what's the other 49 million what's that

4891.34 --> 4895.63
to do with if the 1 if the 150 million

4893.77 --> 4897.43
is to do with gravity what's the other

4895.63 --> 4899.62
49 million nine hundred and ninety-nine

4897.43 --> 4901.6900000000005
mill what's then all that love it what's

4899.62 --> 4904.39
that that's the rest of matter pulling

4901.69 --> 4907.239
correct so what's holding the ocean of

4904.39 --> 4907.909000000001
the water on the oceans to the ball d 50

4907.239 --> 4910.58
million

4907.909 --> 4912.138999999999
- that was described can you see my

4910.58 --> 4919.429
screen it's the mountain tyrant Korra

4912.139 --> 4923.12
it's great it's the gravity exactly it's

4919.429 --> 4926.81
time stronger than one is the thing

4923.12 --> 4929.33
holding the ocean to the earth 50

4926.81 --> 4932.9490000000005
million times stronger to one then the

4929.33 --> 4935.42
force will be density then wouldn't it

4932.949 --> 4937.909
because the rest of that 50 million to

4935.42 --> 4939.889
one not the one but the 49 million the

4937.909 --> 4942.849999999999
rest of it that's to do with what the

4939.889 --> 4945.469
density of the object of course it is

4942.85 --> 4947.570000000001
the gravity that holds the water on the

4945.469 --> 4949.4890000000005
ball or is it the density of the water

4947.57 --> 4951.199
but you still need so much to stop it

4949.489 --> 4953.2699999999995
from falling off the wall off the ball

4951.199 --> 4957.3099999999995
at the bottom so which way round is it

4953.27 --> 4960.110000000001
I think you're completely trolling me

4957.31 --> 4962.0
the gravitational constant the gravity

4960.11 --> 4964.25
force that's the Cavendish quotes is a

4962.0 --> 4965.54
50 millionth of the object's weight so

4964.25 --> 4967.219
if you have all of the weight of the all

4965.54 --> 4969.38
of the trillions and litres and gallons

4967.219 --> 4971.06
of water or all around the world

4969.38 --> 4972.59
you've got 150 millions that's

4971.06 --> 4974.330000000001
responsible for holding it to the

4972.59 --> 4977.33
outside edge of the ball that all right

4974.33 --> 4979.969
let's let's let's go to dinner right now

4977.33 --> 4982.67
why do you why do you think you're

4979.969 --> 4984.25
getting trolled the I mean on on it's an

4982.67 --> 4987.61
honest question why did you say that

4984.25 --> 4993.17
that's what he thought about the idea

4987.61 --> 4997.79
yeah because of what Anthony said about

4993.17 --> 5000.55
density because I know I know we are

4997.79 --> 5003.699
talking about know the density and mass

5000.55 --> 5005.320000000001
everything is related to the weight okay

5003.699 --> 5007.0
so so hold on real quick just because

5005.32 --> 5009.58
I'm trying to understand the language

5007.0 --> 5011.44
that we're using when you say why are

5009.58 --> 5013.36
you trolling me right now or you're

5011.44 --> 5016.69
trolling me right now it's because

5013.36 --> 5019.659
there's a breakdown in communication or

5016.69 --> 5020.888999999999
you think that Anthony is intentionally

5019.659 --> 5024.5199999999995
being obtuse

5020.889 --> 5028.8
I think it's intentionally being obtuse

5024.52 --> 5028.8
for some reason but it doesn't matter

5029.46 --> 5038.71
make an ism Cynder when you're losing an

5032.739 --> 5041.219999999999
argument or you don't have answers say

5038.71 --> 5045.24
you're wrong me or in you you know

5041.22 --> 5048.27
no argument I'll tell Cavendish quote

5045.24 --> 5049.8
quantifiers gravity gravity to be 150

5048.27 --> 5052.2300000000005
millionth of the object's weight and

5049.8 --> 5054.150000000001
gravity is declaimed for why water

5052.23 --> 5056.5199999999995
sticks to the outside ball the outside

5054.15 --> 5058.139999999999
of the ball so if you're telling me that

5056.52 --> 5059.88
the 50 millionth of that weight of the

5058.14 --> 5062.1
oceans is the only thing stopping it

5059.88 --> 5064.35
from floating off into space because of

5062.1 --> 5066.21
being upside down I'm going to say

5064.35 --> 5069.06
that's nonsense because like Arwen says

5066.21 --> 5070.89
it isn't strong enough to it's a 50

5069.06 --> 5073.02
millionth of the object's weight that's

5070.89 --> 5074.97
nowhere near strong enough to to make it

5073.02 --> 5082.830000000001
not fall off the ball that's not what

5074.97 --> 5086.87
gravity is you're misconstruing what I

5082.83 --> 5090.75
said what I was proposing is that an

5086.87 --> 5093.78
object's inherent weight which is the

5090.75 --> 5098.16
one 50 millionth part of the total earth

5093.78 --> 5101.94
gravity is not sufficient to actually

5098.16 --> 5104.28
make something locally this place that

5101.94 --> 5106.32
is what I suggested specifically has

5104.28 --> 5109.44
nothing to do with sticking everything

5106.32 --> 5112.29
to a ball or even moving down or

5109.44 --> 5116.299999999999
anything it's it's only that the

5112.29 --> 5120.03
suggestion my suggestion that matter is

5116.3 --> 5122.49
not strong enough by itself according to

5120.03 --> 5123.03
how gravity is supposed to work in

5122.49 --> 5127.08
theory

5123.03 --> 5129.54
to actually pull anything it's only when

5127.08 --> 5131.58
it's all accumulated as a whole that it

5129.54 --> 5134.93
is supposedly strong enough to actually

5131.58 --> 5139.0199999999995
displace things that is my suggestion

5134.93 --> 5142.08
150 millionth of that force of gravity

5139.02 --> 5145.14
the presumed gravity could never be

5142.08 --> 5148.76
strong enough to to create a critical

5145.14 --> 5152.820000000001
mass in force sufficient to displace

5148.76 --> 5155.34
anything and one thing that is my

5152.82 --> 5158.58
suggestion and I that's what I said I

5155.34 --> 5165.33
agreed with you on our win right we're

5158.58 --> 5168.45
on the same page confusion was a big

5165.33 --> 5171.69
gene a little G but pertaining to this

5168.45 --> 5174.679
value that's 150 million less than

5171.69 --> 5177.909
Earth's gravitational pull

5174.679 --> 5180.53
it's still a value that's above zero so

5177.909 --> 5184.07
when you say that it's never ever gonna

5180.53 --> 5185.96
be able to have any effect on another

5184.07 --> 5188.78
object that's not true

5185.96 --> 5192.949
it's it'll have a an effect that's

5188.78 --> 5195.768999999999
proportionate to its to its size so it's

5192.949 --> 5198.018999999999
very small but it still looks you're a

5195.769 --> 5200.84
small yeah it is very small

5198.019 --> 5203.51
insignificant for me small not very

5200.84 --> 5205.789
small in significantly small yeah I

5203.51 --> 5206.389
disagree she's not but it's bigger than

5205.789 --> 5209.809
zero

5206.389 --> 5215.36
oh really so mathematically is 150

5209.809 --> 5219.05
million not insignificant no because if

5215.36 --> 5223.058999999999
you cancel if you manage to cancel

5219.05 --> 5227.2390000000005
everything else oh are you gonna do that

5223.059 --> 5230.539
removing almost all the friction you can

5227.239 --> 5241.329
end enough time how do we remove entire

5230.539 --> 5246.32
earth is the problem because because

5241.329 --> 5247.759999999999
because the force pulling those objects

5246.32 --> 5252.429
explaining it it's not where the problem

5247.76 --> 5255.9490000000005
stops no Reuben asked me the question I

5252.429 --> 5258.59
think they're telling magic oh my god

5255.949 --> 5262.879999999999
not gonna let him let him explain please

5258.59 --> 5265.610000000001
so the the 50 million times stronger

5262.88 --> 5271.159000000001
force pulling the two leads

5265.61 --> 5275.049999999999
falls down it's it influences them both

5271.159 --> 5278.719
the same way and it goes down it doesn't

5275.05 --> 5281.4490000000005
pull them to another side it just pulls

5278.719 --> 5285.619
them down it isn't like a string

5281.449 --> 5292.549999999999
attached to them making them not getting

5285.619 --> 5296.86
closer together it is this it is just

5292.55 --> 5299.659000000001
pulling them down and this doesn't

5296.86 --> 5303.28
influence them in a way that they could

5299.659 --> 5308.389999999999
move also together because

5303.28 --> 5313.54
down isn't the same as pulling them

5308.39 --> 5315.950000000001
apart from each other it doesn't matter

5313.54 --> 5323.6
you're talking to English you're talking

5315.95 --> 5325.7
gibberish hold on guys we have 89 people

5323.6 --> 5331.400000000001
watching that's a record for my channel

5325.7 --> 5335.2699999999995
entirely I wouldn't do a little shout

5331.4 --> 5337.19
out to the panel and to the chat thank

5335.27 --> 5340.040000000001
you all for coming a flat earth

5337.19 --> 5342.679999999999
early-bird number 50 life has been a

5340.04 --> 5345.62
quite a success so far I will continue

5342.68 --> 5348.35
for at least 20 more minutes I will

5345.62 --> 5351.71
guess I guess I will be doing this every

5348.35 --> 5353.450000000001
day until Nathan Oakley gets everything

5351.71 --> 5355.82
sorted out and the flowers debates can

5353.45 --> 5358.82
start up so you guys are welcome to join

5355.82 --> 5360.259999999999
every day for the next week let's just

5358.82 --> 5361.88
say it like that everybody and chant

5360.26 --> 5363.650000000001
also thank you for coming please don't

5361.88 --> 5366.56
forget to subscribe to my channel if you

5363.65 --> 5368.96
haven't already and upvotes this video

5366.56 --> 5373.700000000001
if you liked it if you want to join the

5368.96 --> 5380.87
panel then contact me on skype and you

5373.7 --> 5382.97
may join so let's continue guys I just I

5380.87 --> 5385.13
just do a quick shout out to Nathan

5382.97 --> 5387.35
forgetting us - you kicked off YouTube

5385.13 --> 5389.93
to help you along he oh shut up

5387.35 --> 5394.34
retracted didn't know I was gonna leave

5389.93 --> 5396.950000000001
it alright I just wanted to quickly just

5394.34 --> 5400.58
back up with Zinder i things in her his

5396.95 --> 5403.429999999999
name what he was saying he wasn't wrong

5400.58 --> 5404.96
I think that maybe um the way he

5403.43 --> 5407.96
explained it it sounded a little bit

5404.96 --> 5410.84
confusing but really just saying that

5407.96 --> 5413.18
the the force of gravity you agree I

5410.84 --> 5415.13
agree get to some of the confusing I put

5413.18 --> 5417.200000000001
it the wrong it was fine it's fine a bit

5415.13 --> 5418.82
I could just tell by the reaction but um

5417.2 --> 5420.8
yes so the force of gravity Earth's

5418.82 --> 5423.23
gravity is in a downward direction so

5420.8 --> 5425.09
anytime they do this cabinet experiment

5423.23 --> 5427.94
or anyone who recreates it they're doing

5425.09 --> 5429.76
it in a perpendicular direction and so

5427.94 --> 5432.989
they're not competing with one another

5429.76 --> 5437.81
it there still is

5432.989 --> 5441.419999999999
the forces it still has to overcome

5437.81 --> 5443.76
basically the downward force but it has

5441.42 --> 5446.61
to overcome their inertia these objects

5443.76 --> 5448.59
you know the issue is what Cavendish

5446.61 --> 5450.33
said himself in the paper he said that a

5448.59 --> 5453.33
force required to move to make these

5450.33 --> 5455.219
balls move is excessively small not

5453.33 --> 5457.89
greater than 150 millionth of the

5455.219 --> 5459.84
object's weight the question is how

5457.89 --> 5461.4890000000005
should that be interpreted now my

5459.84 --> 5464.52
position is that the word weight has

5461.489 --> 5466.709999999999
been raped beat by by maths and it's

5464.52 --> 5468.42
imported that little G there but the

5466.71 --> 5470.1
little G doesn't exist it's a

5468.42 --> 5473.04
mathematical construct in the same way

5470.1 --> 5475.05
that Einsteins relative there's but

5473.04 --> 5477.33
theory of relativity is a mathematical

5475.05 --> 5479.58
Erno spend in a spacetime is a

5477.33 --> 5481.199
mathematical construct if you look up

5479.58 --> 5483.12
the definition of blending of space-time

5481.199 --> 5485.61
it's mathematical it's a construct right

5483.12 --> 5488.61
it's not real but that's what happened

5485.61 --> 5490.92
with the word wait so to say that he the

5488.61 --> 5492.69
wait included little G it back then

5490.92 --> 5494.28
can't possibly be true

5492.69 --> 5496.169999999999
because the word the phrase haven't been

5494.28 --> 5497.639999999999
raped at that point it was using it was

5496.17 --> 5500.4
used in the context of the word wait the

5497.64 --> 5501.9890000000005
way that we normally use it so so that's

5500.4 --> 5504.87
actually what I wanted to clear up and

5501.989 --> 5506.58
after this I'll get to it is I heard you

5504.87 --> 5510.96
guys talking about the G and a big genus

5506.58 --> 5513.63
ammaji you actually don't need these

5510.96 --> 5516.4800000000005
aren't really the subject but go ahead

5513.63 --> 5519.63
okay I'm sorry yes you don't need the

5516.48 --> 5521.37
big G to derive the small G the big G is

5519.63 --> 5523.5
the universal constant it is a constant

5521.37 --> 5526.29
that wasn't found until Cavendish did

5523.5 --> 5528.09
that and and the the little G was

5526.29 --> 5531.15
actually known at the time of Newton

5528.09 --> 5533.67
it's just known as the 921 meters per

5531.15 --> 5537.299999999999
second squared right so it was a the

5533.67 --> 5540.6
deduced mathematical architect tool it's

5537.3 --> 5542.610000000001
as I have described it and big G has

5540.6 --> 5545.85
been philosophically theoretically

5542.61 --> 5548.25
derived from little G so it's the other

5545.85 --> 5553.38
way around all right

5548.25 --> 5556.92
big G was inspired by little G that's

5553.38 --> 5558.54
literally how it came into being yeah

5556.92 --> 5560.88
and so with wait the little gene is

5558.54 --> 5563.58
described as the acceleration downwards

5560.88 --> 5564.55
and so all you need is the mass and then

5563.58 --> 5566.95
you relate

5564.55 --> 5569.26
- this little G you multiply them

5566.95 --> 5572.11
together and then you have to wait yeah

5569.26 --> 5574.570000000001
but in in in Cavendish's paper when he

5572.11 --> 5576.219999999999
says the word wait do you think that

5574.57 --> 5578.08
you'd refer to wait - the way that it's

5576.22 --> 5580.030000000001
been mathematically raped by current

5578.08 --> 5582.64
science or do you think he's referring

5580.03 --> 5587.41
to the colloquial rape phrase how heavy

5582.64 --> 5590.950000000001
is the object those words to describe it

5587.41 --> 5593.23
that as you said it raped I think that

5590.95 --> 5595.96
he's certainly using the definition of

5593.23 --> 5599.61
the word which is the scientific

5595.96 --> 5604.15
definition colloquially only it's not

5599.61 --> 5607.42
necessarily any different okay so this

5604.15 --> 5611.74
one's got little G the other ones not no

5607.42 --> 5613.9
well the classic weight I love being

5611.74 --> 5616.48
able to interrupt in my own show but the

5613.9 --> 5619.48
classic weight is basically the

5616.48 --> 5622.12
experience of weight compared to other

5619.48 --> 5624.79
weights and you can just say okay this

5622.12 --> 5627.55
weighs twice as much as that it's only

5624.79 --> 5630.04
the comparison really that's the

5627.55 --> 5632.17
original meaning of weights it's just

5630.04 --> 5634.3
this is heavy this is less heavy how

5632.17 --> 5636.52
heavy is this exactly twice as heavy as

5634.3 --> 5639.55
that because if you take two of these it

5636.52 --> 5642.990000000001
weighs just as much as this scaling just

5639.55 --> 5646.09
scales that's that's the real weight

5642.99 --> 5647.86
there's math and all these causes and

5646.09 --> 5650.110000000001
all that that came later that came

5647.86 --> 5651.73
during the Renaissance but this is this

5650.11 --> 5654.46
is the whole point of Xander's test

5651.73 --> 5658.24
because then discharged to manipulate a

5654.46 --> 5660.31
mass an object's weight by one fifty

5658.24 --> 5661.09
millionth to show that this is even

5660.31 --> 5663.1900000000005
possible

5661.09 --> 5665.14
let alone that it is true just

5663.19 --> 5667.929999999999
manipulate that 50 millions to one and

5665.14 --> 5670.450000000001
you be the cause so literally flick it

5667.93 --> 5673.06
over from a 50 million to a lesser 50

5670.45 --> 5674.65
million 50 million less 50 million and

5673.06 --> 5676.360000000001
you will never ever be able to do it

5674.65 --> 5679.179999999999
because no matter what weight you get a

5676.36 --> 5681.82
50 millionth is an extremely minut force

5679.18 --> 5683.740000000001
as condish correctly states you're never

5681.82 --> 5686.5
gonna be able to do it's in there you

5683.74 --> 5690.67
know really quick let me get one minute

5686.5 --> 5694.15
so if you got see how see how minut is

5690.67 --> 5696.04
the one of 150 million if you got the

5694.15 --> 5698.45
whole population of Columbia

5696.04 --> 5700.67
that's roughly 50 million people

5698.45 --> 5702.71
so used to get all them 50 million

5700.67 --> 5704.84
people in a freaking gigantic desert

5702.71 --> 5707.39
holding hands all of them doing a circle

5704.84 --> 5709.49
holding hands 50 million people and then

5707.39 --> 5712.22
one of the person breaks the link one

5709.49 --> 5715.04
single person of the 50 million step

5712.22 --> 5716.87
aside do you thing if they are in a in a

5715.04 --> 5719.0
counterweight you know there are all the

5716.87 --> 5721.19
50 million people in one spot this one

5719.0 --> 5723.41
person breaking the link is gonna make a

5721.19 --> 5725.57
difference or or they don't even gonna

5723.41 --> 5731.599999999999
notice it or realize that's how my yes

5725.57 --> 5735.11
Jose yes gravity so Anthony if if ever

5731.6 --> 5738.8
do the same with let's say with much

5735.11 --> 5741.679999999999
bigger that falls it wouldn't be one in

5738.8 --> 5744.68
50 million anymore it would is a ratio

5741.68 --> 5747.25
it yes it why would it not be one in 50

5744.68 --> 5750.320000000001
million is a ratio it's not a weight

5747.25 --> 5752.81
because I increase the mass of the let

5750.32 --> 5754.46
falls that means that the ratio between

5752.81 --> 5758.120000000001
the mass of the earth and the mass of

5754.46 --> 5761.27
the LED balls isn't one in 50 million

5758.12 --> 5762.44
anymore the ratio will always be one in

5761.27 --> 5764.6
50 min oh it won't

5762.44 --> 5766.79
what you trying to manipulate know if I

5764.6 --> 5769.76
would do the same with the with another

5766.79 --> 5773.81
earth the ratio would be one-to-one if I

5769.76 --> 5776.6900000000005
were to try to make two Earth's pull to

5773.81 --> 5778.46
to watch it towards each other the ratio

5776.69 --> 5781.879999999999
wouldn't be 150 million anymore it would

5778.46 --> 5783.95
be one-to-one no it would be the force

5781.88 --> 5785.36
required to make the objects move well

5783.95 --> 5787.639999999999
just matter what the objects are it can

5785.36 --> 5789.95
be able to tower block and it can be a

5787.64 --> 5792.05
car you can vary whatever objects you

5789.95 --> 5793.49
want the force required to make them

5792.05 --> 5796.22
move according to the gravity of the

5793.49 --> 5801.65
earth being one of the objects is 50

5796.22 --> 5806.09
million to one no it isn't what it said

5801.65 --> 5809.78
its if I heard what that's exactly what

5806.09 --> 5812.6900000000005
it says if I if I do the same with cars

5809.78 --> 5816.65
it would be more than one and how is

5812.69 --> 5819.95
that relevant to the set up because he

5816.65 --> 5823.5199999999995
said I need the force one in 50 million

5819.95 --> 5826.76
to make them move towards each other but

5823.52 --> 5830.06
if increased the mass of delet Falls ie

5826.76 --> 5832.16
I manipulates the one in 50 million I

5830.06 --> 5836.900000000001
would be Christ

5832.16 --> 5839.45
okay so by that standards right go to Oh

5836.9 --> 5843.379999999999
No let me finish by that standard go to

5839.45 --> 5847.28
the biggest most solid heaviest mountain

5843.38 --> 5850.16
on the world and I don't know drop a

5847.28 --> 5853.4
feather or whatever a meter away from it

5850.16 --> 5855.16
and see if it actually lands closer to

5853.4 --> 5857.33
the mountain as where you dropped it

5855.16 --> 5860.139999999999
because I don't think that's gonna work

5857.33 --> 5863.5
out even though the mountain is

5860.14 --> 5866.6900000000005
thousands hundreds of thousands times

5863.5 --> 5871.94
heavier has more weight has more gravity

5866.69 --> 5876.7
potential than that let ball okay yeah

5871.94 --> 5876.7
yeah I understand your argument but

5877.21 --> 5884.72
enough really really there is edits a

5880.79 --> 5886.55
hundred thousand times has more gravity

5884.72 --> 5891.2300000000005
potential within it shouldn't that be

5886.55 --> 5895.34
enough no because no no hold on there

5891.23 --> 5899.799999999999
you said no okay so you basically admit

5895.34 --> 5904.6
it is technically impossible impossible

5899.8 --> 5907.1900000000005
to prove that a single out object its

5904.6 --> 5910.67
potential gravity is enough to displace

5907.19 --> 5913.94
anything in other words you can't prove

5910.67 --> 5916.58
that it is actually a thing not finding

5913.94 --> 5918.919999999999
it fall orwen not by letting it fall to

5916.58 --> 5921.41
an attraction attraction if it's

5918.92 --> 5924.2
insignificant too small to attract

5921.41 --> 5929.12
anything to cause displacement then that

5924.2 --> 5931.79
means you can't prove it can displace

5929.12 --> 5934.28
anything horizontally in this case

5931.79 --> 5937.28
because ya need some kind of deviation

5934.28 --> 5939.98
from the vertical from the gravity force

5937.28 --> 5942.65
of the hole so yeah if something else

5939.98 --> 5944.87
cannot locally attract anything cannot

5942.65 --> 5947.179999999999
locally displace anything then the

5944.87 --> 5951.01
entire theory of mass being attracted by

5947.18 --> 5956.3
other mass is completely disproven I

5951.01 --> 5959.99
think you could measure the mountain

5956.3 --> 5963.05
attracting you if you would have a

5959.99 --> 5965.179999999999
sensitive enough measuring device and

5963.05 --> 5967.900000000001
you talk about the feather let's not

5965.18 --> 5967.900000000001
take a feather because

5968.44 --> 5974.45
well you just said that it's not enough

5971.54 --> 5977.86
to actually do that so very sensitive

5974.45 --> 5980.9
device first what are you gonna measure

5977.86 --> 5983.29
electrons or molecules thing is

5980.9 --> 5985.79
happening in the miniature universe like

5983.29 --> 5989.51
interpreting the noise coming from the

5985.79 --> 5992.72
heavens as oh look this must be this

5989.51 --> 5995.09
signal or oh this proves that there must

5992.72 --> 5996.95
be this matter over there because you're

5995.09 --> 5999.56
getting this noise or proving the

5996.95 --> 6001.42
bouncing of a radio signal because

5999.56 --> 6004.450000000001
you're letting your digging in the noise

6001.42 --> 6007.0
right so you just miniaturize it so you

6004.45 --> 6009.55
it all becomes fuzzy and it's all a

6007.0 --> 6013.24
matter of yeah we decided it's real or

6009.55 --> 6013.66
not this is not real no let's not do

6013.24 --> 6016.66
that

6013.66 --> 6021.58
that's not mystify things and keep it

6016.66 --> 6024.79
real so you're letting it fall so I can

6021.58 --> 6028.84
I spin first letting it fall isn't

6024.79 --> 6031.12
enough to the the gravitational

6028.84 --> 6036.91
attraction between the mountain and the

6031.12 --> 6039.79
feather I I don't I think you need a

6036.91 --> 6042.13
much more sensitive device than just

6039.79 --> 6043.42
letting the feather fall because yeah

6042.13 --> 6045.46
that's my point

6043.42 --> 6047.32
what are you gonna use to measure the

6045.46 --> 6049.27
force right let's assume that there's a

6047.32 --> 6051.07
force there you've got to still

6049.27 --> 6053.410000000001
manipulate that without fifty millionth

6051.07 --> 6055.66
to one bit that's the force that he

6053.41 --> 6057.5199999999995
claims is required how are you gonna

6055.66 --> 6059.95
manipulate that not manipulate it but

6057.52 --> 6061.06
how are you gonna demonstrate it so you

6059.95 --> 6062.53
know you'll have to make the force

6061.06 --> 6065.740000000001
yourself right you will be the force

6062.53 --> 6066.82
howie or a machine to do it for you but

6065.74 --> 6069.19
you've got to do something with that

6066.82 --> 6071.53
level of sensitivity to prove that it's

6069.19 --> 6073.089999999999
even capable and I don't even think it

6071.53 --> 6075.429999999999
could be capable with today's technology

6073.09 --> 6076.78
let alone what you had back then so I

6075.43 --> 6079.360000000001
look forward to seeing how you gonna

6076.78 --> 6082.8099999999995
actually demonstrate a variation of a 50

6079.36 --> 6085.54
millionth to one look at the link for

6082.81 --> 6086.97
the positive integers maybe it kind of

6085.54 --> 6089.44
gave you some answers

6086.97 --> 6093.64
is there a demonstration in the air of a

6089.44 --> 6096.429999999999
force just look at it I just I just

6093.64 --> 6097.410000000001
found it right now someone told me I

6096.43 --> 6099.25
should look into it

6097.41 --> 6099.94
alright it's gonna take the word of

6099.25 --> 6103.48
somebody as it could

6099.94 --> 6104.259999999999
a booby trap I don't I don't have it on

6103.48 --> 6106.509999999999
screen

6104.26 --> 6109.09
can I win pops maybe you could do it cuz

6106.51 --> 6112.09
I'm playing come on the conquer I should

6109.09 --> 6113.83
slash you just for that I know what

6112.09 --> 6118.57
about this gravity argument that many

6113.83 --> 6120.91
times I can do any sleep so you need me

6118.57 --> 6121.87
to present something yeah oh just talk

6120.91 --> 6123.79
us through it and let's see what

6121.87 --> 6126.219
nonsense this citation that he's brought

6123.79 --> 6127.989
all this way yeah I just I didn't read

6126.219 --> 6133.27
it now yes oh but you're bringing it up

6127.989 --> 6134.7699999999995
though so let's see I'm just yeah I know

6133.27 --> 6136.360000000001
what you said but you're citing it is

6134.77 --> 6152.620000000001
something so let's see how non so much

6136.36 --> 6155.5599999999995
nonsense it is a let's in the talk us

6152.62 --> 6161.98
through it wait a moment I still have to

6155.56 --> 6164.59
read it you know I just I was aiming it

6161.98 --> 6167.139999999999
for you personally to read and get

6164.59 --> 6169.42
uh-huh that's the problem in Greenville

6167.14 --> 6175.39
Linda you got easy and then tell us what

6169.42 --> 6180.28
we're looking at your citation I was I

6175.39 --> 6184.39
was doing it for you not I'm percentile

6180.28 --> 6189.04
guys yeah but you're doing it that's the

6184.39 --> 6191.2300000000005
point you're bringing it up so let's

6189.04 --> 6199.03
talk us through talk--i series into what

6191.23 --> 6201.299999999999
we're looking at time for somewhere to

6199.03 --> 6201.3
go

6202.21 --> 6213.14
you got really really mixer it was about

6209.57 --> 6216.5599999999995
mums this is why I I asked you to read

6213.14 --> 6217.97
it yeah but you're the new everyone can

6216.56 --> 6220.1
read it right now because it's being

6217.97 --> 6227.68
presented on the show full screens yeah

6220.1 --> 6227.68
what is it we're looking for Zinda no

6227.98 --> 6232.639999999999
problem for you to get right now look

6230.12 --> 6234.53
what I collect here this is the problem

6232.64 --> 6236.12
when we cite something from chat that

6234.53 --> 6238.55
you have no idea what it's to do with

6236.12 --> 6243.28
yeah you should just try to read it

6238.55 --> 6248.81
first yeah yeah it's our favorite

6243.28 --> 6250.19
science i clicked this a little bit when

6248.81 --> 6251.96
bored let's do this to other borders

6250.19 --> 6252.889999999999
they have absolutely no idea what is

6251.96 --> 6255.2300000000005
possible

6252.89 --> 6257.12
okay let me read out because it is not

6255.23 --> 6259.12
going anywhere this xi Hallion

6257.12 --> 6262.25
experiment was an 18th century

6259.12 --> 6266.3
experiment I'm determined the mean the

6262.25 --> 6269.0
make the mean density of the earth okay

6266.3 --> 6272.21
funded by a grant from the Royal Society

6269.0 --> 6275.66
of super reliable always that one it was

6272.21 --> 6279.14
conducted in December of 1774 around

6275.66 --> 6283.7
Scottish mountain of C alien parts

6279.14 --> 6286.1
higher or perch higher the experiment

6283.7 --> 6288.5
involved measuring the tiny deflection

6286.1 --> 6293.06
of the pendulum due to the gravitational

6288.5 --> 6295.46
attraction of the nearby mountain no was

6293.06 --> 6297.92
considered the ideal location after

6295.46 --> 6299.75
search for candidate Mountains thanks to

6297.92 --> 6302.15
its isolation and almost symmetrical

6299.75 --> 6305.36
shape one of the triggers for the

6302.15 --> 6308.71
experience more anomalies noted during

6305.36 --> 6314.179999999999
this survey of the mason-dixon line

6308.71 --> 6317.6
hmm so what is that in the party

6314.18 --> 6319.46
disputes okay fine tell us how they

6317.6 --> 6321.38
manipulated this gravity to prove that

6319.46 --> 6323.84
it was what they claimed it was let me

6321.38 --> 6324.31
tell you exactly how they did that all

6323.84 --> 6327.4400000000005
right

6324.31 --> 6329.660000000001
this mountain this mountain I've heard

6327.44 --> 6334.129999999999
about this nor this mountain is very

6329.66 --> 6335.67
high in iron okay so any pendulum

6334.13 --> 6338.429
you're going to use its

6335.67 --> 6343.16
likely to be a metal it's gonna be

6338.429 --> 6345.4800000000005
attracted to it that's what they did

6343.16 --> 6347.19
who's in there if they were using the

6345.48 --> 6349.379999999999
gravitational force from the mountain

6347.19 --> 6351.0599999999995
how would how would they prove that

6349.38 --> 6352.8
there was actually a gravitational force

6351.06 --> 6354.6
there that they were manipulating

6352.8 --> 6357.51
because if it's science you've got to

6354.6 --> 6361.29
prove an independent variable is the

6357.51 --> 6363.09
cause in your experiment so many factors

6361.29 --> 6365.82
so many factors to manipulate there yeah

6363.09 --> 6368.610000000001
the mountain it's a suggestion it's not

6365.82 --> 6370.86
a really scientific independent variable

6368.61 --> 6372.989
set up they just suggested look the

6370.86 --> 6375.179
pendulum swings slightly more direction

6372.989 --> 6378.959999999999
of the mountain we're gonna completely

6375.179 --> 6380.9400000000005
not isolate the variables and suggest

6378.96 --> 6382.949
that might be there may be some magnetic

6380.94 --> 6386.07
influence and immediately suggest that

6382.949 --> 6388.53
it is gravity look it's going that way

6386.07 --> 6390.57
it must be gravity we're right that's

6388.53 --> 6392.73
what it is so you know what the begging

6390.57 --> 6396.42
the question or affirming the consequent

6392.73 --> 6398.07
fallacy is in there so let me respond to

6396.42 --> 6402.39
our and first if they would do the same

6398.07 --> 6404.5199999999995
with concrete a concrete pendulum would

6402.39 --> 6407.1900000000005
you accept that's there no something

6404.52 --> 6409.9800000000005
else than electromagnetism going on no

6407.19 --> 6413.8099999999995
if it's showing these strong deviations

6409.98 --> 6416.79
then Lauren yeah but it has

6413.81 --> 6419.610000000001
electrostatics been excluded you need to

6416.79 --> 6423.449
exclude everything an open mountain in

6419.61 --> 6425.46
the open air you don't you don't even

6423.449 --> 6429.48
know what it has in it you don't know

6425.46 --> 6433.38
what's going on here so how are you

6429.48 --> 6435.959999999999
gonna isolate gravity after having yeah

6433.38 --> 6438.4800000000005
isolated all the other possibilities of

6435.96 --> 6442.29
what could be going on that is creating

6438.48 --> 6448.049999999999
oh some kind of deviation in a

6442.29 --> 6450.41
horizontal fashion I would say by taking

6448.05 --> 6454.4890000000005
something that isn't affected by

6450.41 --> 6457.5
electromagnetism in a way of magnetism

6454.489 --> 6460.28
science that's it did did you not hear

6457.5 --> 6464.07
me say electrostatics because

6460.28 --> 6466.98
electrostatics is not just for farewell

6464.07 --> 6468.84
ferrous metals it can work on anything

6466.98 --> 6469.349999999999
it's like static electricity and dust

6468.84 --> 6471.72
can

6469.35 --> 6474.780000000001
be any kind of dust it will attract it

6471.72 --> 6478.110000000001
will be attracted so we need to measure

6474.78 --> 6480.0
all that and see what is that mountain

6478.11 --> 6483.69
what is that area what is in the air

6480.0 --> 6486.06
what energies are in the air well on

6483.69 --> 6488.94
let's go back to Linux let's go back to

6486.06 --> 6491.85
basics in a scientific experiment the

6488.94 --> 6493.95
observer or the the demonstrator must

6491.85 --> 6496.2300000000005
manipulate the independent variable to

6493.95 --> 6498.33
prove that it is the cause now in this

6496.23 --> 6500.04
paper it's claimed that gravitational

6498.33 --> 6501.9
effects from the mountain were the cause

6500.04 --> 6503.94
of the pendulum swinging towards the

6501.9 --> 6508.5
mountain did they manipulate that and

6503.94 --> 6510.45
proved cause yes or no I would like to

6508.5 --> 6512.58
read this little party sorry for

6510.45 --> 6514.98
interrupting but it's really funny

6512.58 --> 6518.24
because it says here the experiment had

6514.98 --> 6520.83
previously been considered but rejected

6518.24 --> 6523.2
by Isaac Newton as a practical

6520.83 --> 6526.05
demonstration of theory of gravitation

6523.2 --> 6528.36
however these scientists were convinced

6526.05 --> 6531.360000000001
that it would be possible so they

6528.36 --> 6534.24
undertook the experiment pretty much

6531.36 --> 6539.46
yeah Isaac Newton was wrong and certain

6534.24 --> 6542.34
things so yeah why it was rejected was

6539.46 --> 6546.81
he wrong by not claiming a hypothesis

6542.34 --> 6549.57
for the theory of gravitation I don't

6546.81 --> 6550.8
know what he did and what not but well

6549.57 --> 6554.7
he declared that that's that's

6550.8 --> 6555.75
historically documented so was he wrong

6554.7 --> 6559.5599999999995
about that as well

6555.75 --> 6561.57
I don't know maybe so well I've not

6559.56 --> 6563.52
heard my question answered in this

6561.57 --> 6565.259999999999
experiment it's claimed that the

6563.52 --> 6568.080000000001
gravitational pull from the mountain

6565.26 --> 6570.18
influenced the Pope the pendulum did

6568.08 --> 6573.9
they manipulate the independent variable

6570.18 --> 6578.360000000001
to prove cause or not because if they

6573.9 --> 6582.719999999999
didn't prove cause it's not science well

6578.36 --> 6584.04
they put a pendulum next to it so yeah

6582.72 --> 6585.96
yes

6584.04 --> 6589.61
what what's making the pendulum do what

6585.96 --> 6596.25
they say it did oh oh look they use an

6589.61 --> 6597.839999999999
exquisitely sensitive torsion balance so

6596.25 --> 6600.42
basically it's another variation of the

6597.84 --> 6601.45
Cavendish experiment right and they did

6600.42 --> 6604.33
use last

6601.45 --> 6607.57
led masses by the way so that excited

6604.33 --> 6609.37
yeah that does exclude magnetism well

6607.57 --> 6611.29
everything's magnetic to some degree I

6609.37 --> 6613.2699999999995
know that they say that leg is not an

6611.29 --> 6615.64
outlet yeah but if everything then you

6613.27 --> 6618.34
can exclude it nevertheless so correct

6615.64 --> 6620.29
well in any event the point is that to

6618.34 --> 6622.6900000000005
prove calls in a scientific experiment

6620.29 --> 6624.22
the observer must manipulate the

6622.69 --> 6625.54
independent variable because your

6624.22 --> 6628.75
independent variable is your presumed

6625.54 --> 6630.25
cause right so if the calls is supposed

6628.75 --> 6632.23
to be the gravitational pull from the

6630.25 --> 6634.3
mountain that's the cause that you've

6632.23 --> 6635.41
got a manipulate so I want to know what

6634.3 --> 6636.9400000000005
did they do to manipulate the

6635.41 --> 6638.23
gravitational effect of the mountain or

6636.94 --> 6640.33
the gravitational force from the

6638.23 --> 6649.299999999999
mountain so what's wrong maybe the

6640.33 --> 6651.22
pendulum this is sorry sorry to

6649.3 --> 6654.34
interrupt I am interrupting a lot I know

6651.22 --> 6656.530000000001
but look at this data the conclusions

6654.34 --> 6659.860000000001
drawn from these X this is repeat

6656.53 --> 6661.599999999999
experiments concerning this it's the

6659.86 --> 6666.3099999999995
right from the Cavendish main article

6661.6 --> 6670.450000000001
but all these married measured results

6666.31 --> 6674.860000000001
are completely different over the ages

6670.45 --> 6681.94
this is ridiculous look five point four

6674.86 --> 6686.17
four eight five point three 4.5 4.8 I'm

6681.94 --> 6687.759999999999
gonna say this I'm gonna say that the

6686.17 --> 6689.71
effect on the pendulum was caused by a

6687.76 --> 6690.6900000000005
southwesterly wind at two point six

6689.71 --> 6694.0
miles per hour

6690.69 --> 6696.3099999999995
boom if you're repeated like thousand

6694.0 --> 6700.92
times on other times other parts of the

6696.31 --> 6704.2300000000005
month so just always it's in there

6700.92 --> 6707.14
didn't see this the results the

6704.23 --> 6710.669999999999
suggested density is fluctuating

6707.14 --> 6712.660000000001
heavenly heavily in all the measured

6710.67 --> 6717.55
experiments as they like to call it

6712.66 --> 6720.22
so how reliable is that really if if the

6717.55 --> 6722.68
mass measure deduced from this

6720.22 --> 6728.2
experiment seems to be varying within

6722.68 --> 6730.92
10% of total that is quite a chunk

6728.2 --> 6732.67
I'd say populous as you're in the

6730.92 --> 6734.4890000000005
gravitational thing that they think the

6732.67 --> 6736.86
major in if it's

6734.489 --> 6738.599999999999
exactly that's my it depends where you

6736.86 --> 6740.45
stand it depends for you oh really

6738.6 --> 6745.320000000001
it's a gravitational constant is it not

6740.45 --> 6749.16
it shouldn't matter its various no hold

6745.32 --> 6751.11
on hold on Xander this this measurement

6749.16 --> 6755.3099999999995
hold on hold on hold on these results

6751.11 --> 6757.32
are not the direct measuring of

6755.31 --> 6759.780000000001
something local it is the deduction

6757.32 --> 6763.37
based on the experiments that they did

6759.78 --> 6765.87
and how much it the swing deviates that

6763.37 --> 6768.36
number these numbers right there are the

6765.87 --> 6770.4
deduced conclusions from the experiments

6768.36 --> 6772.44
okay it doesn't really matter how far

6770.4 --> 6776.07
away from the mountain you are or on top

6772.44 --> 6778.589999999999
of it it is the derived information from

6776.07 --> 6782.07
the experiments and the result vary

6778.59 --> 6789.93
massively over ten percent in the

6782.07 --> 6792.179999999999
formula in the in the model how do you

6789.93 --> 6794.13
explain that huge gap there unless the

6792.18 --> 6796.7390000000005
mass of the Earth is very fluctuating

6794.13 --> 6798.03
hugely games in that I would say perhaps

6796.739 --> 6800.3099999999995
they weren't measure in what they think

6798.03 --> 6806.929999999999
of as you mean after all the equation

6800.31 --> 6810.780000000001
proves nothing or as a sense maybe the

6806.93 --> 6814.25
word different location I think I just

6810.78 --> 6816.989
explained to you why that's not relevant

6814.25 --> 6821.25
I just explained to you why that's not

6816.989 --> 6822.209999999999
relevance in there I think that it's

6821.25 --> 6827.19
significant that

6822.21 --> 6830.94
Zinder just said or because in my

6827.19 --> 6833.12
opinion that is conceding Anthony's

6830.94 --> 6835.889999999999
point so Anthony made his point

6833.12 --> 6839.5199999999995
cinder understood it and now is offering

6835.89 --> 6842.34
an alternative no I was talking to

6839.52 --> 6844.89
Ireland okay well whatever my point is

6842.34 --> 6848.57
is that there was a point given to you

6844.89 --> 6851.34
and you then changed tactics and said or

6848.57 --> 6854.7
so now you're offering something as an

6851.34 --> 6857.88
alternative which means the previous

6854.7 --> 6863.219
point made has to be acknowledged by you

6857.88 --> 6865.34
do you acknowledge it do you deny it or

6863.219 --> 6867.78
is more like a martyr than you I'm

6865.34 --> 6871.659000000001
talking about Armand

6867.78 --> 6877.09
any citation is nonsense talking about

6871.659 --> 6878.739
Arwen spines so if I misspoke in terms

6877.09 --> 6884.679
of whose point it was that's beside the

6878.739 --> 6886.659
point my point was that you said or so

6884.679 --> 6888.1900000000005
now you're offering an alternative so

6886.659 --> 6889.719
you have to go back to the previous

6888.19 --> 6891.428999999999
point payment I want to understand

6889.719 --> 6894.34
whether or not you're conceding it or

6891.429 --> 6901.29
denying it so

6894.34 --> 6903.969
Arwen said that the difference of the I

6901.29 --> 6907.5
don't know how many can you bring it

6903.969 --> 6912.55
back up how many years were what was its

6907.5 --> 6914.8
repeated from what I could see in what I

6912.55 --> 6918.099
presented it's been repeated at least

6914.8 --> 6920.8
three or four times and within these

6918.099 --> 6924.55
repeat experience the deduced conclusion

6920.8 --> 6928.4400000000005
about the density varies well from what

6924.55 --> 6931.42
I can see roughly in a march of 10%

6928.44 --> 6934.719
fluctuation and that's not a local

6931.42 --> 6943.869
measurement that is the deduced average

6934.719 --> 6946.679
of the experiments so by I and maybe

6943.869 --> 6952.449
them and always to the same location

6946.679 --> 6956.9800000000005
it's over 50% yeah so it's in the head

6952.449 --> 6961.299999999999
would looks like tation but who gave you

6956.98 --> 6961.869
this citation nick said I should look

6961.3 --> 6965.1990000000005
into it

6961.869 --> 6966.659
Nick we're talking about because we were

6965.199 --> 6968.888999999999
talking about mountains

6966.659 --> 6970.989
Noelle's giving you a citation that you

6968.889 --> 6972.9400000000005
blindly look dance and basically asked

6970.989 --> 6974.678999999999
us to look at and when we look at it it

6972.94 --> 6976.388999999999
basically shows that whatever that they

6974.679 --> 6978.429
think that we were measuring fluctuated

6976.389 --> 6980.59
wildly and if it was actually gravity

6978.429 --> 6982.719
the only conclusion that you can deduce

6980.59 --> 6984.969
from that must be that the earth must be

6982.719 --> 6986.65
fluctuating it's maths must agree

6984.969 --> 6988.4800000000005
otherwise it weren't the gravity that we

6986.65 --> 6990.61
were measurement or they didn't order

6988.48 --> 6994.209999999999
weren't too precise and measurements

6990.61 --> 6996.94
because it was six are the change if you

6994.21 --> 6999.01
know it's like the seven six are that

6996.94 --> 7001.23
you gotta change manipulate the shape of

6999.01 --> 7005.9890000000005
the earth to be able to see them

7001.23 --> 7008.91
if they're yeah let's make it [ __ ] yeah

7005.989 --> 7011.04
do you agree that if bass if our in

7008.91 --> 7013.2
citation or interpretation of the

7011.04 --> 7015.9
results is accurate and that they were

7013.2 --> 7017.76
very in by for up to fifty percent do

7015.9 --> 7019.139999999999
you agree that if it was gravity that

7017.76 --> 7021.45
they were observing or measuring or

7019.14 --> 7022.83
whatever then the only conclusion that

7021.45 --> 7024.57
you can realistically come to is that

7022.83 --> 7026.64
the earth must be changing its mass by

7024.57 --> 7031.58
massive amounts for that to be gravity

7026.64 --> 7035.280000000001
no how can I was could it be interpreted

7031.58 --> 7039.63
that wasn't exactly the same each time

7035.28 --> 7042.63
they did it yes why would they be

7039.63 --> 7045.2390000000005
mentioned here as repeat experiments

7042.63 --> 7046.89
should be no it should be not made it

7045.239 --> 7048.87
exactly the same we don't know that

7046.89 --> 7050.700000000001
yeah well the Mohave then you can't call

7048.87 --> 7055.05
it a repeat experiment if it's not

7050.7 --> 7056.82
exactly the fact that the results are

7055.05 --> 7058.56
changing means that it can't be gravity

7056.82 --> 7062.58
unless the mass of the earth is can

7058.56 --> 7064.05
start to change awaiting wrong right

7062.58 --> 7068.1
Jonas thought the definition of gravity

7064.05 --> 7071.64
is here yeah do you know yeah because

7068.1 --> 7073.67
these these are in here are fluctuating

7071.64 --> 7076.35
right and the gravitational constant

7073.67 --> 7079.14
shouldn't be fluctuating little June

7076.35 --> 7082.05
isn't gonna be fluctuating it's gonna be

7079.14 --> 7085.650000000001
elevate the effect of the gravity caused

7082.05 --> 7087.3
by the mountain yeah would be different

7085.65 --> 7090.299999999999
depending on how far away from the

7087.3 --> 7092.58
matter you are right and is that what

7090.3 --> 7095.1900000000005
they were changing yet it yeah get it

7092.58 --> 7098.61
the Sun proximity okay we're done you

7095.19 --> 7102.599999999999
would stand it good done no memory in

7098.61 --> 7105.21
the proximity Robert was probably the

7102.6 --> 7107.34
number suggest they do they do a yes or

7105.21 --> 7110.88
no if you don't know look it up don't

7107.34 --> 7112.47
guess well you're saying yours you're so

7110.88 --> 7117.03
you're being definitive and you haven't

7112.47 --> 7119.1900000000005
looked it up Heelys why are you falling

7117.03 --> 7121.71
back on this argument again and again

7119.19 --> 7125.61
while I told you specifically it's not

7121.71 --> 7128.04
the measured force that they are putting

7125.61 --> 7130.5
out the results of it's the average

7128.04 --> 7133.08
density of it all and it fluctuates

7130.5 --> 7136.11
enormous ly it's not because of their

7133.08 --> 7138.78
distance to the mountain or

7136.11 --> 7143.219
it is the deduction based on the

7138.78 --> 7145.41
experiment the density is the valid

7143.219 --> 7147.36
question because there's so many shitty

7145.41 --> 7149.699
factors that you cannot manipulate all

7147.36 --> 7151.86
of them because his name is not a valid

7149.699 --> 7154.11
experiment is between different

7151.86 --> 7156.299999999999
different results every time so you

7154.11 --> 7157.92
gotta just yeah you know the serious

7156.3 --> 7160.38
experiment they should be looking into

7157.92 --> 7162.12
it monsoon you know we should dismiss

7160.38 --> 7164.43
this as a scientific evidence because it

7162.12 --> 7167.3099999999995
doesn't do what you say it does this was

7164.43 --> 7171.39
suggested by Nick out as proving school

7167.31 --> 7172.650000000001
but when we looked into it results and

7171.39 --> 7175.26
they don't support the claim that

7172.65 --> 7178.11
there's a gravitational pull right when

7175.26 --> 7181.7390000000005
it's measurement results the the output

7178.11 --> 7184.889999999999
becomes wild and all over the place then

7181.739 --> 7188.009999999999
the model used for that experiment it

7184.89 --> 7189.21
simply isn't reliable or they weren't

7188.01 --> 7192.3
measuring what they thought they were

7189.21 --> 7200.31
measuring well that's also a sign of non

7192.3 --> 7204.84
reliability but yeah if you if you touch

7200.31 --> 7207.96
fire and you burn yourself did you burn

7204.84 --> 7214.32
yourself regardless if you know how hot

7207.96 --> 7217.83
the fire is one does have to do with

7214.32 --> 7219.36
what we're looking at well I think he's

7217.83 --> 7221.219
trying to roast a red herring on a

7219.36 --> 7226.139999999999
campfire yeah and it seems like a red

7221.219 --> 7230.969
herring so does it matter how precise

7226.14 --> 7236.79
the experiments were yeah he's fixed

7230.969 --> 7239.699
absolutely if they didn't get the right

7236.79 --> 7242.67
values but they still could see that the

7239.699 --> 7245.04
pendulum moves a little bit towards the

7242.67 --> 7246.51
mountain yeah you're not measuring what

7245.04 --> 7248.0
you think measuring because it's not

7246.51 --> 7250.2300000000005
doing what you thought it would do

7248.0 --> 7252.87
fundamental principle of your hypothesis

7250.23 --> 7254.669999999999
make the prediction you test it and then

7252.87 --> 7255.39
see does it support your prediction and

7254.67 --> 7257.79
what do you know

7255.39 --> 7259.59
it was fluctuating so either the

7257.79 --> 7261.09
alternative hypothesis has been applied

7259.59 --> 7262.860000000001
well the null hypothesis has been

7261.09 --> 7265.58
applied one or the other but they didn't

7262.86 --> 7268.349999999999
validate their claim that's the point

7265.58 --> 7270.96
the gravitational constant work

7268.35 --> 7274.200000000001
then the results would be constant it's

7270.96 --> 7276.24
very basic can I ask you a question real

7274.2 --> 7278.13
quick arms I'm looking through the I

7276.24 --> 7281.16
think the same thing you're looking at

7278.13 --> 7283.95
I'm just trying to see where you came up

7281.16 --> 7293.75
with 50% all right here

7283.95 --> 7295.32
so density numbers 455 4 and here is 750

7293.75 --> 7298.32
let me see

7295.32 --> 7302.429999999999
it's yeah these numbers pretty much all

7298.32 --> 7305.3099999999995
over the place so yeah it's why I'm up

7302.43 --> 7308.34
with 450 and then this is the F this is

7305.31 --> 7314.04
the conclusion of their experiments the

7308.34 --> 7316.110000000001
results from these experiments okay and

7314.04 --> 7319.53
now I just wanted to clear up that the

7316.11 --> 7321.0599999999995
that G this little G isn't a constant as

7319.53 --> 7327.599999999999
I meant that's not known as a constant

7321.06 --> 7329.22
are they right listen if you're not if

7327.6 --> 7330.93
you're claiming that the gravitational

7329.22 --> 7333.4800000000005
force from the mountain is being

7330.93 --> 7335.400000000001
observed in this we can guarantee on

7333.48 --> 7337.5599999999995
your model that the gravitational force

7335.4 --> 7339.24
of the mountain will be a constant it

7337.56 --> 7342.02
won't be variable because it's not

7339.24 --> 7345.48
changing its mass yeah correct yeah

7342.02 --> 7348.150000000001
that's fine we'll stay constant but

7345.48 --> 7352.5
gravity or month around the Earth is not

7348.15 --> 7356.49
constant but that number in

7352.5 --> 7359.36
gravitational constant and the G I get

7356.49 --> 7363.42
the feelin gravity is destabilizing

7359.36 --> 7365.49
know the bending of space time we're all

7363.42 --> 7368.39
being warped we have to be careful

7365.49 --> 7372.24
gravity is destabilizing

7368.39 --> 7374.1900000000005
so Jonah explain what you mean by what

7372.24 --> 7376.62
you just not sure um they're completely

7374.19 --> 7378.8099999999995
different values um they're they have a

7376.62 --> 7381.42
relationship to one another but big G is

7378.81 --> 7385.29
the universal constant it's so expressed

7381.42 --> 7388.38
as big G then you multiply two masses

7385.29 --> 7391.17
and then divide by the distance squared

7388.38 --> 7392.85
and that gives you the force little G is

7391.17 --> 7394.86
not even described that way at all

7392.85 --> 7397.05
little G is just described as the

7394.86 --> 7401.789
acceleration as we see it on earth which

7397.05 --> 7404.400000000001
is measured in meters per second squared

7401.789 --> 7406.71
so they're different number for

7404.4 --> 7409.018999999999
different values the one on earth is

7406.71 --> 7410.909
constant the little G is a comma sorry

7409.019 --> 7414.3
the big G is a constant the little G is

7410.909 --> 7415.71
not constant because in this context

7414.3 --> 7418.409000000001
what is it the measurement of imagine

7415.71 --> 7422.82
little G or big G of the mass of trying

7418.409 --> 7424.289
to derive the big gene but right know in

7422.82 --> 7425.489
a scientific experiment they're trying

7424.289 --> 7427.559
to prove a cause and an effect

7425.489 --> 7429.36
relationship so in this one it would be

7427.559 --> 7431.070000000001
a cause of gravitational force of

7429.36 --> 7433.65
mountain and the effect would be of a

7431.07 --> 7435.239
needle moving or something some other

7433.65 --> 7437.4
they can measure it with that'll be the

7435.239 --> 7438.959999999999
effect so what is it that what is it

7437.4 --> 7440.219
that is it big G little G or something

7438.96 --> 7444.09
else that the measuring in this thing if

7440.219 --> 7447.65
they're getting very wild variations so

7444.09 --> 7450.42
I'm reading where he said the 4,500

7447.65 --> 7451.589999999999
value it's saying that that that's

7450.42 --> 7454.829
saying right here that that was

7451.59 --> 7459.389
suggested and then later corrected and

7454.829 --> 7464.849
so the value that we have now I'm seeing

7459.389 --> 7467.61
here I'm trying to see where they why

7464.849 --> 7470.219
they change these numbers probably no

7467.61 --> 7479.159
they didn't change the numbers these

7470.219 --> 7482.579
numbers were the results okay did you

7479.159 --> 7484.17
hear what I just say the numbers they

7482.579 --> 7488.57
didn't change the numbers of what should

7484.17 --> 7492.869
be theoretically there these are the

7488.57 --> 7493.88
results of their experiments do you

7492.869 --> 7498.03
understand

7493.88 --> 7500.789
okay and also that do you understand no

7498.03 --> 7504.739
I understand that that 75 was wrong it

7500.789 --> 7510.599
says plus or minus 1900 right next to it

7504.739 --> 7514.11
so that wasn't what it says 7,500 plus

7510.599 --> 7518.309
or minus 1900 1900 what what's the

7514.11 --> 7521.009999999999
unit's involved doesn't that mean

7518.309 --> 7525.079000000001
between seven and a half thousand and

7521.01 --> 7528.719
one point nine thousand kilograms

7525.079 --> 7531.869
in between that plus/minus in between

7528.719 --> 7533.579
these numbers yes so it says 75 hundred

7531.869 --> 7535.679
plus or minus 1900

7533.579 --> 7541.32
should go up to about right so that's

7535.679 --> 7544.53
like between one and five that seems

7541.32 --> 7548.82
like that's a pretty large doctrine that

7544.53 --> 7550.499
was of that one that one value and then

7548.82 --> 7553.459
at the very end of this it says that the

7550.499 --> 7557.07
agreed-upon value is somewhere around

7553.459 --> 7560.659
4.8 those are five point four plus or

7557.07 --> 7562.679
minus 250 which is a very much smaller

7560.659 --> 7564.719
margin of error but it's still around

7562.679 --> 7566.669
the same value as the the other number

7564.719 --> 7569.629
gave us so it didn't change rapidly

7566.669 --> 7574.499
interesting okay so it's only 10% only

7569.629 --> 7576.3589999999995
10% and let's remember beyond the 5% of

7574.499 --> 7578.55
statistical significance so therefore

7576.359 --> 7579.839
you would argue rightly so that this is

7578.55 --> 7582.599
not actually proving the claim that

7579.839 --> 7584.369
they're making those out falls outside

7582.599 --> 7586.559
of statistical significance in other

7584.369 --> 7588.808999999999
words all the causes are being in play

7586.559 --> 7593.129
they've not got enough controls both

7588.809 --> 7595.409000000001
deny the model is not refined enough

7593.129 --> 7598.169
it's not correct enough there's too much

7595.409 --> 7599.879
variation correct they failed to control

7598.169 --> 7602.669
the variables or they're not measuring

7599.879 --> 7608.57
what they think the measurement yeah to

7602.669 --> 7608.57
be clear that's point one percent no no

7608.599 --> 7612.719
statistical significance is five percent

7610.619 --> 7620.459
yeah you know I'm saying on this one

7612.719 --> 7623.82
here from 48 54 80 plus to 50 and then

7620.459 --> 7629.6089999999995
the other one was 5600 so that that only

7623.82 --> 7631.799999999999
changed by 0.1 percent no no there's a

7629.609 --> 7637.079000000001
numbers here

7631.8 --> 7638.909000000001
I mean I'm I don't see how you got a

7637.079 --> 7641.04
different value than that but yeah well

7638.909 --> 7645.839999999999
they did they did the experiment that's

7641.04 --> 7646.86
the results they had I'm not really

7645.84 --> 7648.929
seeing the problem here was the

7646.86 --> 7650.5199999999995
clutching at straws desperately holding

7648.929 --> 7652.5
on to the claim that they somehow proved

7650.52 --> 7654.179
gravity no this one I don't think

7652.5 --> 7657.51
actually proves this one is a good

7654.179 --> 7659.96
example of of how to find it but it's

7657.51 --> 7662.46
not it's kind of sloppy because of the

7659.96 --> 7665.19
reasons we said that the masses change

7662.46 --> 7666.63
the measurement if there's a good

7665.19 --> 7669.69
example about to find it but then you

7666.63 --> 7673.469
don't find it that's a perfect example

7669.69 --> 7680.94
that's yeah I would say I would disprove

7673.469 --> 7682.889
that you gravity cannot be measured you

7680.94 --> 7685.07
just have to read it off a screen it'll

7682.889 --> 7687.900000000001
tell you how much it is

7685.07 --> 7690.48
yeah these methods are very sloppy and

7687.9 --> 7693.679
they're old they're using an estimate

7690.48 --> 7698.03
for the size of the mountain so if we

7693.679 --> 7703.619
how would you interpret our citation

7698.03 --> 7705.63
your citation - this wasn't mine

7703.619 --> 7708.2699999999995
somebody who wasn't Zinta's brought this

7705.63 --> 7712.829
up no yes in the brought up on the on

7708.27 --> 7715.110000000001
the experiment well modern times we have

7712.829 --> 7717.808999999999
gravimeters which do basically this but

7715.11 --> 7719.339999999999
they do have much more precise yeah by

7717.809 --> 7720.929
meters but how are you gonna prove that

7719.34 --> 7722.429
the gravity meter is measuring anything

7720.929 --> 7723.96
other than the ether because I'm gonna

7722.429 --> 7726.179
say that the gravimeters are measuring

7723.96 --> 7727.9800000000005
the ether the movement of the ether are

7726.179 --> 7729.36
you gonna prove that it's not you're

7727.98 --> 7731.159
making the claim that it's gravity right

7729.36 --> 7734.13
but you can't prove it well actually

7731.159 --> 7736.619
there was another experiment the grace

7734.13 --> 7744.409000000001
satellites like one around the earth and

7736.619 --> 7748.29
measured local gravity in space

7744.409 --> 7751.679
late last night the meter actually was

7748.29 --> 7753.69
used to Rober eight these values and

7751.679 --> 7755.429
they came to be yeah but if it doesn't

7753.69 --> 7757.23
prove if it doesn't show that it's

7755.429 --> 7759.4800000000005
measuring this thing called gravity it's

7757.23 --> 7761.098999999999
not measuring gravity I'm gonna say it's

7759.48 --> 7762.9
measuring the ether how are you gonna

7761.099 --> 7764.38
prove this measuring gravity you could

7762.9 --> 7767.23
call it something else but

7764.38 --> 7770.64
the thing is these values they have a

7767.23 --> 7773.08
relationship yeah what with what with

7770.64 --> 7777.51
you can give it another name but it

7773.08 --> 7782.86
would be a relationship with with maths

7777.51 --> 7785.35
perhaps houses the big G in the small G

7782.86 --> 7787.92
are directly related you know that in

7785.35 --> 7791.110000000001
every attempt to scientifically prove

7787.92 --> 7795.81
gravity all you end up doing is proving

7791.11 --> 7799.75
that mass has an inherent force to it

7795.81 --> 7801.55
there's literally the set up mass level

7799.75 --> 7804.04
inheritance will be but that is the

7801.55 --> 7807.400000000001
conclusion from the gravity experiment

7804.04 --> 7809.89
really well inclusion that's their

7807.4 --> 7812.0199999999995
independent variable that they basically

7809.89 --> 7814.06
ignore they say you have to manipulate

7812.02 --> 7815.650000000001
the mass in order to manipulate the

7814.06 --> 7817.96
gravity because that's where the gravity

7815.65 --> 7820.33
is from but yeah all they're doing is

7817.96 --> 7823.56
using mass as their independent

7820.33 --> 7828.76
variables so they're proving that mass

7823.56 --> 7832.81
has a force thing into it that's all

7828.76 --> 7834.79
that's all they're doing so it doesn't

7832.81 --> 7837.370000000001
prove gravity gravity is a deduction

7834.79 --> 7842.5199999999995
construct it's a mathematical concept

7837.37 --> 7845.44
it's a philosophical construction tool

7842.52 --> 7848.950000000001
it's an aberration it's not really a

7845.44 --> 7851.71
thing it is just a pattern among the

7848.95 --> 7854.71
pattern of things that can be used it's

7851.71 --> 7856.57
not actually a self-sufficient thing you

7854.71 --> 7860.05
can't prove it you can't measure it you

7856.57 --> 7862.42
can't bury it you can't scientifically

7860.05 --> 7864.820000000001
prove it you can't you just said how you

7862.42 --> 7868.57
vary it and you know no you varied the

7864.82 --> 7870.28
mass you don't vary the gravity you vary

7868.57 --> 7872.32
the mass and that gives a different

7870.28 --> 7873.849999999999
force of the gravity you can call it

7872.32 --> 7875.44
anything that you'd like to call it yeah

7873.85 --> 7877.870000000001
but it you have to know that it is a

7875.44 --> 7883.33
force congratulations you proof that

7877.87 --> 7885.76
mass has forced to it congratulations it

7883.33 --> 7890.5
has a force relationship yeah with other

7885.76 --> 7892.570000000001
mass and no no you actually have to

7890.5 --> 7895.21
prove that first before you make that

7892.57 --> 7896.19
claim that's what we've been talking

7895.21 --> 7898.7390000000005
about this past

7896.19 --> 7900.839999999999
two hours oh no you can prove that mass

7898.739 --> 7903.629999999999
has forced to it because hey when there

7900.84 --> 7907.110000000001
is mass ya forces will get involved in a

7903.63 --> 7910.650000000001
stationary state but that doesn't prove

7907.11 --> 7913.679999999999
that there is a force externally

7910.65 --> 7916.679999999999
exerting its force on the mass it just

7913.68 --> 7924.150000000001
proves scientifically that mass is the

7916.68 --> 7926.9400000000005
cause you're describing the same thing

7924.15 --> 7929.129999999999
in two different ways no I'd say

7926.94 --> 7929.759999999999
Darwin's a Freudian slip they're all a

7929.13 --> 7931.71
mistake

7929.76 --> 7933.81
if you're gonna say that mass as an

7931.71 --> 7935.37
attractive force then I want to see

7933.81 --> 7936.719
proof that mass as an attractive force

7935.37 --> 7938.73
because we know that there are many

7936.719 --> 7940.08
failed Cavendish experiments and the

7938.73 --> 7941.759999999999
wall has refused to acknowledge these

7940.08 --> 7943.35
failed Cavendish experiments and only

7941.76 --> 7945.54
cite that the ones that they think proof

7943.35 --> 7947.4890000000005
like for instance slice bar Kane and

7945.54 --> 7949.83
Miles Daliah Davis in his bedroom

7947.489 --> 7951.599999999999
that's the citation that ball is used to

7949.83 --> 7953.94
prove that mass is enough tractive for

7951.6 --> 7956.58
or has an attractive force but we've got

7953.94 --> 7959.58
enough scientific experiments that have

7956.58 --> 7961.53
failed just show the opposite and I say

7959.58 --> 7965.699
that sly in his bedroom and mild oh I

7961.53 --> 7968.55
had no use in his bedroom failed Anthony

7965.699 --> 7971.759999999999
now you're really saying that you can

7968.55 --> 7974.34
disprove something by failing an

7971.76 --> 7976.77
experiment I'm saying that if you guys

7974.34 --> 7979.35
think that Cavendish proves anything to

7976.77 --> 7981.81
do with gravity then when we look at the

7979.35 --> 7983.79
people that fail to reproduce the

7981.81 --> 7985.530000000001
Cavendish experiments and compare them

7983.79 --> 7987.54
to the people that claim to have put

7985.53 --> 7990.03
successfully reproduced it were

7987.54 --> 7992.04
comparing slight science laboratory's in

7990.03 --> 7993.96
physics departments and universities and

7992.04 --> 7997.98
stuff with the likes of miles the laia

7993.96 --> 8000.41
Davis and slice barking and I said and I

7997.98 --> 8003.23
say that they're not credible I can't

8000.41 --> 8006.23
believe that you just made the argument

8003.23 --> 8008.69
that only because people fail to make an

8006.23 --> 8011.5599999999995
experiment that it kind of annihilates

8008.69 --> 8015.44
the experiments that were successful

8011.56 --> 8016.780000000001
point of the experiment the principal

8015.44 --> 8018.0199999999995
components in the scientific method

8016.78 --> 8020.66
repeatability

8018.02 --> 8022.219
so it's oh you know are you familiar

8020.66 --> 8024.0199999999995
with that with the clip of the bloke

8022.219 --> 8025.4890000000005
that's in the in the lab that he saw he

8024.02 --> 8027.7390000000005
cuts it in half and he says that he

8025.489 --> 8029.48
couldn't get this thing to work he's not

8027.739 --> 8030.409
meant to get it to work it's meant to do

8029.48 --> 8032.178999999999
it all by itself

8030.409 --> 8034.46
and the guy got so frustrated with it

8032.179 --> 8037.6990000000005
ecoute you enough are you familiar with

8034.46 --> 8041.889
that never heard of that no I'll have to

8037.699 --> 8044.15
show you I'll send it to you it's far

8041.889 --> 8047.27
so you're saying because there are

8044.15 --> 8050.12
people who are too incompetent to make

8047.27 --> 8053.75
an experiment successful everyone who

8050.12 --> 8057.5
was competent enough should be dismissed

8053.75 --> 8059.9
because I'm saying that ball is

8057.5 --> 8061.67
cherry-pick and lie about the success of

8059.9 --> 8064.009999999999
the experiment to support the fact that

8061.67 --> 8065.77
it's supposed to work but there is

8064.01 --> 8068.54
credible alternative that is credible

8065.77 --> 8070.790000000001
counter arguments for it not working and

8068.54 --> 8073.159
your counter arguments for it working

8070.79 --> 8075.409
are slice bar Cain and Myles the liar

8073.159 --> 8077.299999999999
Davis in their bedrooms with styrofoam

8075.409 --> 8079.25
boards that were not part of the

8077.3 --> 8081.05
experiments but there are credible

8079.25 --> 8082.61
alternatives that say that they can't do

8081.05 --> 8084.37
it and I'm just about to send it to our

8082.61 --> 8086.7699999999995
whanau on the thingy

8084.37 --> 8091.9
Arwen if you play the sound will it play

8086.77 --> 8094.52
I don't know we'll try it

8091.9 --> 8096.32
where do you want to play a video I

8094.52 --> 8102.620000000001
don't think that's a good idea in here

8096.32 --> 8105.259999999999
really you know what we've been going

8102.62 --> 8107.57
for two hours maybe they want to just

8105.26 --> 8109.610000000001
save that one will take I'll take a look

8107.57 --> 8113.239
at or you know what I'll just post it in

8109.61 --> 8114.799999999999
chat I can post in chat so people can

8113.239 --> 8117.58
take a look at it I don't want to risk a

8114.8 --> 8121.58
copyright strike if you know what I mean

8117.58 --> 8126.5
it's the link that yeah it's the right

8121.58 --> 8128.96
one right you want to go to the four

8126.5 --> 8132.5
minute twelve market all right so I'm

8128.96 --> 8134.81
posting it in the YouTube chat so people

8132.5 --> 8139.25
can watch themselves I'll take a look at

8134.81 --> 8141.05
it and yeah I think I kind of need to

8139.25 --> 8143.57
round out the show we've been going on

8141.05 --> 8146.03
for very long let me just conclude with

8143.57 --> 8148.13
that link at four minutes twelve look at

8146.03 --> 8150.0199999999995
the the guy says how difficult it is to

8148.13 --> 8152.57
repeat the experiment that is his

8150.02 --> 8154.76
understudy cuts it in sores it in half

8152.57 --> 8156.83
because he can't get it to work

8154.76 --> 8158.54
now it's not the event to get it to work

8156.83 --> 8160.1
it's meant to work all by itself but

8158.54 --> 8161.96
this guy got that frustrated with it

8160.1 --> 8164.13
that he caught it enough so what we've

8161.96 --> 8167.25
got a compare is slide that slice

8164.13 --> 8168.75
Kaine a mile flight only was doing both

8167.25 --> 8170.73
repeating the experiment in their

8168.75 --> 8173.219
bedroom using styrofoam boards that were

8170.73 --> 8175.5
not part of the experiment and claiming

8173.219 --> 8177.3
victory compared to a physics department

8175.5 --> 8179.55
in some university somewhere you

8177.3 --> 8181.4400000000005
couldn't repeat it so do you accept sly

8179.55 --> 8183.150000000001
and Miles the lie Davis or do you accept

8181.44 --> 8186.839999999999
real science and I'm gonna say that Mars

8183.15 --> 8189.9
Leah Davis is a liar and so are are you

8186.84 --> 8192.3
accept d-10 or whatever

8189.9 --> 8196.559
Cavendish experiments I just put in here

8192.3 --> 8198.63
by amateurs oh yeah the time the point

8196.559 --> 8201.059
is there's enough doubt over it in

8198.63 --> 8203.219
general to raise the question of does it

8201.059 --> 8204.75
actually work so yeah you can present

8203.219 --> 8206.07
you can present as many as you want but

8204.75 --> 8208.2
there's enough out there to show that it

8206.07 --> 8210.149
doesn't work so it's like is he actually

8208.2 --> 8211.62
doing what you say it's doing bit like

8210.149 --> 8212.88
the mountain one where you claim it's

8211.62 --> 8217.649000000001
got a gravitational force that you

8212.88 --> 8219.66
measure in I'll say no all right but do

8217.649 --> 8223.74
your mind put this video in the chat

8219.66 --> 8227.96
Arwen so people can compare it the

8223.74 --> 8227.96
language I just just compare it to the

8230.479 --> 8237.929
okay cinder I'll put your link out as

8233.61 --> 8239.519
well yeah and let's round this out

8237.929 --> 8243.559
because I think you guys would probably

8239.519 --> 8246.210000000001
go on for another hour but I need lunch

8243.559 --> 8253.139
yeah this is normally the time that even

8246.21 --> 8255.149
the the African elephants stops so yeah

8253.139 --> 8262.729
thank you very much drop the microphone

8255.149 --> 8265.41
and walk off the stage okay thank you

8262.729 --> 8268.59
yes thank you all for coming

8265.41 --> 8271.95
chocolate Jay Jose is sleeping warrior

8268.59 --> 8274.380000000001
traffice Adam Aiken was ends in there

8271.95 --> 8275.939
it's been you've been a fantastic panel

8283.469 --> 8287.88
three hours if you know what I mean so

8285.33 --> 8291.42
unless you guys actually do join me

8287.88 --> 8293.67
eventually then I'm gone I will cut the

8291.42 --> 8295.559
Hangout short but if you guys come back

8293.67 --> 8296.469000000001

great to have a panel also not so much

8341.889 --> 8346.778999999999
pressure on me to talk constantly and

8344.109 --> 8348.91
yeah flat earth absolutely flat earth

8346.779 --> 8352.12
all the way with science I love this

8348.91 --> 8355.269
episode probably my best so far also I

8352.12 --> 8357.099
think I might have hit the hundred

8355.269 --> 8360.639000000001
viewers at some point I'm not too sure

8357.099 --> 8363.069
I'd hit the 88 at least but anyway yeah

8360.639 --> 8366.429
it's been a great hangout despite all

8363.069 --> 8370.899
the trolls and everything Karen being

8366.429 --> 8373.63
chef I see here so many people the some

8370.899 --> 8375.608999999999
