a mango milkshake okay

264.24 --> 273.36

269.36 --> 273.36
the show i feel a little bit weird

274.32 --> 280.71999999999997
this morning like i woke up really early

278.32 --> 282.88
and i felt sick

280.72 --> 284.72
but it wasn't because of alcohol or

282.88 --> 287.44
anything like that

284.72 --> 288.24
nothing like that thank god but i think

287.44 --> 290.56
like i

288.24 --> 291.759
i don't know ate these kind of potato

290.56 --> 294.0
things yesterday

291.759 --> 294.0
and

295.199 --> 299.36
something weird about them even though

296.72 --> 302.639
it was all organic

299.36 --> 305.36
i just felt really sick this morning so

302.639 --> 305.36
yeah i gotta be

308.32 --> 312.32
not that i threw up or anything but just

313.36 --> 317.44
like yeah i i can't explain it but it's

316.639 --> 319.36
still

317.44 --> 321.039
like it's much better right now but it's

319.36 --> 322.56
still kind of weirdly lingering in the

321.039 --> 325.759
back

322.56 --> 331.039
also i have to admit that

325.759 --> 334.32
the chat at dell bothered me a little

331.039 --> 334.32
okay christian

336.32 --> 346.4
chad adele you mean like three days ago

341.44 --> 346.4
okay uh

349.44 --> 355.759
right but anyway yeah i i still have

352.639 --> 359.12
issues with my jaw it's not really

355.759 --> 359.12
as pressing as before

360.96 --> 365.28
but it did come back in a minor way and

363.12 --> 380.56
it is

365.28 --> 386.08
like agitating

380.56 --> 386.08
okay kristen uh look this doesn't work

386.4 --> 394.08
can't say don't focus on me

390.479 --> 396.24
and then yeah

394.08 --> 397.75899999999996
you're not really staying anonymous this

396.24 --> 400.319
way so

397.759 --> 401.44
whatever i'm fine with that by the way i

400.319 --> 404.40000000000003
don't really mind

401.44 --> 404.4
welcome to the stream

404.56 --> 409.84
carrots cauliflower raw with water

412.479 --> 418.15999999999997
was the most expensive worst cannabis

415.759 --> 418.16
okay

420.479 --> 425.52
but yeah kristin i was actually gonna

423.44 --> 429.68
eat some

425.52 --> 432.4
green leaf or uh lattice

429.68 --> 434.24
because i know that would help i i don't

432.4 --> 436.71999999999997
eat enough of it i don't eat it like

434.24 --> 438.40000000000003
every day i should probably should

436.72 --> 441.759
i'm actually gonna get some of that

right now just gonna choose some greens

441.759 --> 451.84000000000003
i'll be back

462.84 --> 465.84

716.16 --> 718.56
awesome

729.12 --> 734.5600000000001
contact to meet up what you want to give

732.0 --> 745.839
it to me in person

734.56 --> 745.8389999999999
do i know you

756.839 --> 760.9590000000001
okay

758.16 --> 764.8

760.959 --> 764.8
have we met before in person

769.12 --> 773.76
going back to command and car okay fine

771.76 --> 776.24
dude i don't really play online games

773.76 --> 776.24
like that

778.8 --> 783.519
i i do resort to playing strategy games

781.92 --> 788.56
every now and then

783.519 --> 788.5600000000001
i prefer games like civilization

790.24 --> 792.72
we have

794.0 --> 801.839
okay so you wait

802.639 --> 807.04
are you the guy that went completely

804.399 --> 807.04
nuts on me

809.12 --> 813.76
and i banned you did you just sneak back

811.36 --> 815.36
in here as somebody else

813.76 --> 817.2
i'm fine with that by the way because

815.36 --> 819.519
hey you're behaving

817.2 --> 820.32
fine right and that's really the key to

819.519 --> 821.839
it

820.32 --> 825.6800000000001
that's why i ban people it's not

821.839 --> 825.6800000000001
personal it's because of behavior

827.279 --> 830.639
it was me yeah it doesn't really make it

829.6 --> 832.639
any clearer but

830.639 --> 834.5600000000001
i i think i know who you are you're the

832.639 --> 838.639
guy with the blonde hair that i met

834.56 --> 838.6389999999999
several times right

838.88 --> 847.6
you gave me that the old white laptop

843.519 --> 847.6
use scrounge for metals right

850.56 --> 859.68
okay okay fine that's kind of weird

856.639 --> 862.88
that i didn't recognize you for so long

859.68 --> 871.3599999999999
i guess you really dropped the

862.88 --> 874.72
behaviors quite consistently

871.36 --> 876.72
thank you thank you for well for

874.72 --> 880.88
forgiving me

876.72 --> 884.0
i know you asked me to forgive you

880.88 --> 888.079
i do if you correct yourself i forgive

884.0 --> 892.16
you that's how i operate

888.079 --> 892.16
sounds a little robotic but it's true

892.56 --> 896.56
i'm just not sure that everybody always

895.12 --> 899.839
forgives me

896.56 --> 899.8389999999999
for doing it like that oh hold on

937.44 --> 955.839
huh all right

940.48 --> 955.839
yeah roommate asking me for some tools

960.0 --> 966.0
right that's it yeah well what i got the

962.639 --> 969.36
feeling is that you got carried away by

966.0 --> 971.199
trauma sensation

969.36 --> 972.88
and at some point i felt like you

971.199 --> 976.079
couldn't snap out of it anymore

972.88 --> 978.56
then you were even saying you were aware

976.079 --> 978.56
about it

979.36 --> 983.759
but then at some point i just wasn't

981.68 --> 984.4799999999999
able to really communicate with you

983.759 --> 988.32
anymore

984.48 --> 988.32
because you were just too bothered by it

989.519 --> 994.0
right and i knew that if i continued to

992.959 --> 997.04
push it

994.0 --> 1011.8389999999999
i would only enhance your trauma trauma

997.04 --> 1011.8389999999999
experience although

1021.36 --> 1026.799
totally broken right well i'm just i'm

1024.24 --> 1030.319
just glad you're out of it again man

1026.799 --> 1033.6
because it was it was tough for me to uh

1030.319 --> 1034.319
to see you being like that to be honest

1033.6 --> 1038.079
i had

1034.319 --> 1043.6
i i thought you were gonna end badly

1038.079 --> 1043.6
then again i've been

1044.0 --> 1049.039
like during that time there the earlier

1046.72 --> 1051.76
early bird times i was kind of

1049.039 --> 1055.12
traumatized myself you might remember

1051.76 --> 1058.799
everybody remembers that's been hanging

1055.12 --> 1063.039
with me in this show for a long time

1058.799 --> 1065.76
i myself have kind of like managed to

1063.039 --> 1067.84
to take it down a notch and then keep it

1065.76 --> 1067.84
there

1071.679 --> 1075.2800000000002
i really want to become good friends for

1073.44 --> 1078.4
life well

1075.28 --> 1081.84
that may be a little forward but i

1078.4 --> 1085.6000000000001
appreciate the gesture

1081.84 --> 1090.08
that you would feel like that towards me

1085.6 --> 1091.6789999999999
not sure if i'm ready for that like

1090.08 --> 1095.84
i think you probably have a more

1091.679 --> 1098.88
extensive social life than i do

1095.84 --> 1102.24
right so i am really a hermit i

1098.88 --> 1105.44
i i don't know if you felt that about me

1102.24 --> 1105.44
when we met in person

1107.36 --> 1110.6399999999999
like even before i have started to

1109.919 --> 1113.2
really live

1110.64 --> 1114.4
solo like this and kind of settle with

1113.2 --> 1118.4
that

1114.4 --> 1120.72
i was always just a group drifter

1118.4 --> 1122.799
i would just move in a group and just

1120.72 --> 1126.08
flow with it wherever it went

1122.799 --> 1137.36
but it was completely out of my control

1126.08 --> 1138.8799999999999
a lot of the time

1137.36 --> 1142.0
like i didn't have a really good

1138.88 --> 1142.0
developed mechanism

1142.88 --> 1147.0390000000002
where my moral radar would force me to

1145.36 --> 1149.6789999999999
step out of the group

1147.039 --> 1150.08
i had a lot of trouble like leaving the

1149.679 --> 1152.72
group

1150.08 --> 1156.559
over moral conflicts that was a

1152.72 --> 1156.559
universal problem on my part

1156.96 --> 1161.2
now you might have noticed i have

1160.16 --> 1165.039
completely

1161.2 --> 1167.8400000000001
turned that inside out and i'm like over

1165.039 --> 1172.24
compensating to kind of

1167.84 --> 1174.6399999999999
negate that mechanism for myself

1172.24 --> 1174.64
because

1177.76 --> 1181.6
otherwise i'd always have that

1182.08 --> 1184.3999999999999
all right

1185.84 --> 1189.36
anyway yeah it's gonna take some getting

1188.64 --> 1192.7990000000002
used to

1189.36 --> 1194.6399999999999
knowing that it's that it's you but yeah

1192.799 --> 1197.36
dutch sailor's been around in the chat

1194.64 --> 1197.3600000000001
for a long time

1204.84 --> 1207.84
so

1209.36 --> 1213.52
right no no dude we're friends it's just

1212.24 --> 1216.24
that the idea of

1213.52 --> 1221.84
best buddies forever that kind of

1216.24 --> 1221.84
unnerves me

1222.559 --> 1227.039
but yes friends and hey when i take

1225.44 --> 1230.24
somebody as a friends

1227.039 --> 1234.24
as a friend that's serious right i don't

1230.24 --> 1236.48
easily make friends

1234.24 --> 1236.48
uh

1239.039 --> 1242.08
right and to be fair dude i did judge

1241.52 --> 1249.84
you

1242.08 --> 1249.84
i did

1255.36 --> 1258.559
all right but i also know why it was

1257.52 --> 1260.48
because

1258.559 --> 1263.84
it became too much for me to handle and

1260.48 --> 1263.84
i had to kind of like

1268.559 --> 1272.24
distance myself like that

1272.96 --> 1276.159
no not after no dude but that that's

1274.88 --> 1278.88
something that i i

1276.159 --> 1279.8400000000001
really never do anyway you know once

1278.88 --> 1282.7990000000002
like whatever

1279.84 --> 1284.08
friendship or contact is kind of the the

1282.799 --> 1287.28
thing is broken

1284.08 --> 1287.9189999999999
i never afterward to start whining about

1287.28 --> 1290.799
it

1287.919 --> 1291.3600000000001
and start [ __ ] on them i never do

1290.799 --> 1294.72
that

1291.36 --> 1297.6
like that's terrible behavior i'm very

1294.72 --> 1298.559
happy that i've never had that natural

1297.6 --> 1304.1589999999999
to me

1298.559 --> 1306.96
i never really do that

1304.159 --> 1307.2800000000002
right to do that publicly like i might

1306.96 --> 1309.2
be

1307.28 --> 1312.3999999999999
like calling up my friend and they'd be

1309.2 --> 1315.6000000000001
like ah this person is driving me nuts

1312.4 --> 1318.3200000000002
right like that but i'd never be like

1315.6 --> 1321.36
for the next day on my show oh this

1318.32 --> 1324.6399999999999
person turns out to be complete

1321.36 --> 1327.6
evil crazy and avoid him and

1324.64 --> 1327.6000000000001
like block him and

1327.76 --> 1334.64
and then continue doing that like

1331.039 --> 1334.64
there's people out there that do that

1345.6 --> 1351.52
never heard of that what oh

1348.799 --> 1351.52
dude what

1354.0 --> 1357.84
what were you called earlier i don't

1356.48 --> 1361.84
remember

1357.84 --> 1361.84
what was your account name

1375.28 --> 1378.559
okay right

1378.64 --> 1385.2800000000002
okay if that's what that means to you

1382.0 --> 1387.84
to me that's just like character

1385.28 --> 1389.52
like how i saw you is like yes you would

1387.84 --> 1392.799
never

1389.52 --> 1394.08
like sell out right that's something i'd

1392.799 --> 1396.32
never see you do

1394.08 --> 1398.1589999999999
but what i did see you do was go out of

1396.32 --> 1402.24
control get paranoid

1398.159 --> 1405.919
and then attack based on the paranoia

1402.24 --> 1406.96
and that could be if you're not aware of

1405.919 --> 1409.1200000000001
that happening

1406.96 --> 1411.3600000000001
with a friend or yours could be

1409.12 --> 1414.559
considered backstabbing but

1411.36 --> 1419.36
i i know you'd

1414.559 --> 1419.36
you would never do that

1420.0 --> 1423.919
except outside of paranoia right

1425.919 --> 1430.0
right so i think what you mean good

1428.24 --> 1432.159
friends for life is just

1430.0 --> 1435.279
trusting that the other is never gonna

1432.159 --> 1435.279
like sell you out

1437.36 --> 1440.799
and yeah i'm with that

1441.76 --> 1444.08
right

1447.84 --> 1453.9189999999999
right yeah andrew what are you talking

1451.6 --> 1453.9189999999999
about

1456.84 --> 1463.1999999999998
intj

1458.72 --> 1473.84
a little add to place by the way

1463.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
and good servant

1478.88 --> 1486.159
introvert intuitive thinking and judging

1483.6 --> 1486.7199999999998
okay i didn't know there was a that was

1486.159 --> 1490.0800000000002
a thing

1486.72 --> 1493.44
but yeah that those are all

1490.08 --> 1493.4399999999998
elements that i do have

1499.039 --> 1502.8799999999999
and sometimes it it kind of gets to me

1501.52 --> 1507.039
too

1502.88 --> 1509.679
right because every time i talk

1507.039 --> 1511.76
i always talk as if i'm like some

1509.679 --> 1513.8400000000001
diplomatic representative

1511.76 --> 1515.12
like it sounds a little weird but it's

1513.84 --> 1517.12
true i always do

1515.12 --> 1519.1999999999998
is every time i try to convey something

1517.12 --> 1522.2399999999998
i take it very seriously

1519.2 --> 1525.52
like more serious than is

1522.24 --> 1526.159
on average assumed logical i just do

1525.52 --> 1528.559
that

1526.159 --> 1531.5200000000002
because i can't help it and i want

1528.559 --> 1531.52
everybody kind of

1531.679 --> 1536.48
to take things more serious because i

1533.6 --> 1536.48
think that that would

1537.12 --> 1541.279
yeah that would probably help people

1539.44 --> 1544.96
just get out of

1541.279 --> 1544.96
bad cycles better but

1545.84 --> 1550.08
now now i'm losing my train of thought

1547.76 --> 1552.799
right oh no no no i remember

1550.08 --> 1553.6
yesterday it was weird because other

1552.799 --> 1555.84
people

1553.6 --> 1557.9189999999999
talk serious too right for all kinds of

1555.84 --> 1559.279
reasons like there's a party or this

1557.919 --> 1562.5590000000002
just friends meeting

1559.279 --> 1566.72
getting a conversation and i

1562.559 --> 1566.72
zone in on that [ __ ] it's almost like

1566.88 --> 1574.159
spying because i just

1570.559 --> 1577.279
i zone in but it's for purely psycho

1574.159 --> 1580.48
analysis like i want to understand

1577.279 --> 1583.279
where is this guy that's talking

1580.48 --> 1584.159
at a distance where is he at with his

1583.279 --> 1586.08
mind

1584.159 --> 1588.159
where is he at with his moral frequency

1586.08 --> 1590.96
is he aware

1588.159 --> 1592.96
of things the and how does he prove that

1590.96 --> 1595.76
with what he's saying

1592.96 --> 1597.039
right that's a thing that i typically

1595.76 --> 1600.48
get stuck in

1597.039 --> 1602.8799999999999
and i get also very restless over

1600.48 --> 1604.799
it makes it hard to be more social

1602.88 --> 1608.5590000000002
because a lot of people out there

1604.799 --> 1610.84
literally they talk they pair it they

1608.559 --> 1613.44
parrot

1610.84 --> 1615.4399999999998
things and i just know

1613.44 --> 1616.96
because of how they present it in the

1615.44 --> 1620.4
context that

1616.96 --> 1621.8400000000001
they're not fully tuned in into what

1620.4 --> 1625.3600000000001
they're doing and that's like

1621.84 --> 1627.1999999999998
really disturbing to me like so many

1625.36 --> 1630.32
people are off

1627.2 --> 1633.44
in ways and that's like

1630.32 --> 1636.24
almost demoralizing to me

1633.44 --> 1636.24
disappointing

1637.2 --> 1646.0
but it's like 20 years ago i wouldn't

1641.76 --> 1648.08
really have seen that as much

1646.0 --> 1650.0
i still knew there were things off but i

1648.08 --> 1651.12
thought everything was up i didn't think

1650.0 --> 1654.08
there was something as

1651.12 --> 1654.799
on like i didn't think things could be

1654.08 --> 1657.1999999999998
right

1654.799 --> 1660.1589999999999
i think i thought everything was off i

1657.2 --> 1663.76
thought i was normal

1660.159 --> 1668.24
very weird but now that have

1663.76 --> 1671.919
purified much more now i feel

1668.24 --> 1674.799
how it's wrong and that the people

1671.919 --> 1676.96
doing that don't know it they don't know

1674.799 --> 1680.24
it they don't see it

1676.96 --> 1682.32
and they talk in all kinds of directions

1680.24 --> 1684.96
and they literally don't know what

1682.32 --> 1684.96
they're dealing with

1692.98 --> 1697.84
[Music]

1695.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
what

1699.039 --> 1707.039
how far from zandford uh

1703.279 --> 1708.64
i don't know like i'm pretty much in the

1707.039 --> 1712.8799999999999
middle of netherlands

1708.64 --> 1715.679
zomb fort is right at the coast

1712.88 --> 1717.5200000000002
roughly at the middle of the netherlands

1715.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
so that's like half of the country's

1717.52 --> 1725.84
distance away

1727.6 --> 1732.8799999999999
right that's it yeah well people that

1729.84 --> 1736.6399999999999
have taken the injection on blind faith

1732.88 --> 1738.7990000000002
and virtue signal with it

1736.64 --> 1740.0800000000002
that's so distressing to me when i pick

1738.799 --> 1742.32
up on that it

1740.08 --> 1745.279
it almost literally nauseates me and i

1742.32 --> 1745.279
have to walk away

1746.96 --> 1753.8400000000001
no it's not everybody out here

1750.64 --> 1754.24
thank god but there's some and you can

1753.84 --> 1756.8799999999999
tell

1754.24 --> 1756.88
you can tell

1759.679 --> 1764.48
that becomes this weird subconscious

1761.919 --> 1767.919
desperation

1764.48 --> 1770.88
tone through everything they say

1767.919 --> 1770.88
it's really weird

1774.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
hey getting wisdom good to see you

1792.24 --> 1795.679
i'm not saying you're wrong thing it's

1794.24 --> 1799.6
fresh it's frustrating

1795.679 --> 1799.6000000000001
that models are for survives that

1806.84 --> 1809.84
frustrating

1815.6 --> 1824.08
what am i afraid of well i'm afraid of

1819.52 --> 1827.679
the literature and the doctors

1824.08 --> 1837.84
what they said it would do

1827.679 --> 1837.8400000000001
and the list is endless

1853.6 --> 1858.32
right but you know gemini

1858.399 --> 1866.6399999999999
luna i'm not so much afraid

1863.519 --> 1869.919
i'm more worried on how

1866.64 --> 1873.279
the people take the vaccine than

1869.919 --> 1877.44
actually what the vaccine does to them

1873.279 --> 1879.919
and because that that second part is

1877.44 --> 1880.48
overt it's blatant when it happens it

1879.919 --> 1883.919
happens

1880.48 --> 1885.039
the people that are fall victim to the

1883.919 --> 1886.88
side effects

1885.039 --> 1889.679
which are actually the main effects

1886.88 --> 1889.679
because there is

1890.84 --> 1896.559
no consistent

1893.279 --> 1899.519
aimed effect that could even be

1896.559 --> 1900.72
empirically proven to come from this

1899.519 --> 1904.48
experimental

1900.72 --> 1906.64
jab right

1904.48 --> 1908.96
so all the side effects are then

1906.64 --> 1911.519
basically the main effects

1908.96 --> 1912.3990000000001
right but they are overt so people that

1911.519 --> 1916.0
take it

1912.399 --> 1917.76
yeah they have a chance to figure out

1916.0 --> 1919.84
okay this is completely messed up and

1917.76 --> 1920.399
now i messed up or i got lucky or

1919.84 --> 1923.039
whatever

1920.399 --> 1923.4399999999998
right but those that have the mindset of

1923.039 --> 1926.0
we

1923.44 --> 1927.6000000000001
have to take it no matter what it the

1926.0 --> 1930.08
the risk is worth it

1927.6 --> 1931.76
even though the statistics don't match

1930.08 --> 1935.84
on that logic

1931.76 --> 1935.84
that's much more worrying

1937.039 --> 1940.399
because those people are going to like

1939.279 --> 1944.399
become more like

1940.399 --> 1947.76
cultists and they will put try to drag

1944.399 --> 1948.0
others down with them right that's much

1947.76 --> 1950.48
more

1948.0 --> 1950.48
worrying

1952.559 --> 1956.799
because those will be the ones that will

1954.48 --> 1957.919
actually even after things have gone to

1956.799 --> 1960.8799999999999
[ __ ]

1957.919 --> 1962.0
try to convince others to step into

1960.88 --> 1965.2
their foolish dream

1962.0 --> 1967.6
with them and if those others are happen

1965.2 --> 1969.519
to be weak in that moment and desperate

1967.6 --> 1973.36
for

1969.519 --> 1976.72
some connection they might

1973.36 --> 1978.399
might just fall for it not

1976.72 --> 1980.64
of course depends on the individual how

1978.399 --> 1991.84
strong they are overall

1980.64 --> 1991.8400000000001
and well informed but still

1993.76 --> 1996.559
oh jesus

2002.0 --> 2005.84
that's horrible dutch seder

2041.84 --> 2047.84
jesus but why did she

2045.36 --> 2047.84
take that

2048.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
that is that is like really horrific

2065.28 --> 2072.159
kills of work of course

2069.04 --> 2075.839
of course yeah that's how they get him

2072.159 --> 2075.839
thanks feminism

2077.359 --> 2089.839
i can't really blame that all of that

2114.839 --> 2117.839
uh

2128.839 --> 2131.839
so

2186.24 --> 2201.839
are you talking to me at place

2190.0 --> 2201.839
i have no idea what you're talking about

2220.8 --> 2227.28
well yeah terra 306 [ __ ] it

2224.48 --> 2229.76
no just ignore it it's all just [ __ ]

2227.28 --> 2232.6400000000003
it's just a narrative

2229.76 --> 2233.92
that's all there is nothing literally

2232.64 --> 2237.52
nothing

2233.92 --> 2242.64
right kovit it's made up

2237.52 --> 2257.839
in wuhan lab

2242.64 --> 2257.839
yeah emphasize the word up in that

2267.599 --> 2274.56
when we turn that gyroscope that jar you

2270.64 --> 2277.359
you mean the ring laser gyroscope

2274.56 --> 2278.72
right in contrast to the other

2277.359 --> 2282.839
gyroscopes

2278.72 --> 2284.8799999999997
that didn't drift the replica you mean

2282.839 --> 2288.32
that

2284.88 --> 2291.839
that the non-mechanical light based

2288.32 --> 2294.079
gyroscope drifted while the physical

2291.839 --> 2296.32
mechanical gyroscope didn't yeah yeah we

2294.079 --> 2296.32
know

2296.839 --> 2299.839
congratulations

2303.76 --> 2309.3590000000004
now dutch sailor coffin is not real in

2306.88 --> 2309.359
anything

2310.64 --> 2314.4
it's a fiction it's a science it's a

2313.68 --> 2317.9199999999996
medical

2314.4 --> 2320.48
science fiction creation it's literally

2317.92 --> 2321.359
not what they say it is it's body

2320.48 --> 2325.119
inherent

2321.359 --> 2327.839
has nothing to do with infection

2325.119 --> 2327.839
at all

2329.68 --> 2336.0
it's a condition and it's

2332.88 --> 2339.28
natural it's a natural part

2336.0 --> 2339.28
of the body's functions

2339.76 --> 2345.599
everybody has it

2342.96 --> 2346.0
and then when you screw yourself over

2345.599 --> 2350.0
you

2346.0 --> 2350.88
toxic toxidify yourself or you totally

2350.0 --> 2354.0
stress yourself

2350.88 --> 2356.56
out or push your limits

2354.0 --> 2357.44
over the edge yeah you will become

2356.56 --> 2359.48
toxified

2357.44 --> 2362.0
and then depending on the nature of

2359.48 --> 2366.0
detoxification

2362.0 --> 2368.64
specific exosomes will be summoned

2366.0 --> 2370.32
to clean up the mess with correlating

2368.64 --> 2374.16
symptoms

2370.32 --> 2377.28
and one of those types

2374.16 --> 2378.96
of results one of those conditions would

2377.28 --> 2380.96
be classified covet

2378.96 --> 2382.0
yeah that's what it is because

2380.96 --> 2385.2
everything

2382.0 --> 2386.48
about it is not what they say it is the

2385.2 --> 2390.0789999999997
entire story

2386.48 --> 2392.41
is a science fiction cover story

2390.079 --> 2393.8390000000004
it's completely made up

2392.41 --> 2396.8799999999997
[Music]

2393.839 --> 2400.24
zero infection danger because there is

2396.88 --> 2411.839
nothing to infect that doesn't exist

2400.24 --> 2411.839
it's not medically proven that it is

2422.839 --> 2425.839
so

2429.599 --> 2436.4
right it

2433.2 --> 2438.319
to me a good comparison to make it

2436.4 --> 2440.64
blatantly apparent as to what i'm

2438.319 --> 2442.8
talking about why i say that viruses are

2440.64 --> 2446.0
not infectious agents and you never have

2442.8 --> 2446.0
to worry about it ever

2446.079 --> 2452.96
ever is

2449.28 --> 2456.48
to come to say like ooh nails

2452.96 --> 2459.839
dude nails see these nails well nails

2456.48 --> 2462.96
are very dangerous because they

2459.839 --> 2465.2799999999997
could grow and grow and then

2462.96 --> 2466.96
you can get an inhale and then you could

2465.28 --> 2468.8
get an infection from that and

2466.96 --> 2471.359
potentially die

2468.8 --> 2473.92
so we got to be super careful and define

2471.359 --> 2476.96
some policy

2473.92 --> 2480.0
to contain the nail danger

2476.96 --> 2482.7200000000003
right sounds totally absurd right when

2480.0 --> 2483.52
i say it like that well it's actually a

2482.72 --> 2487.04
pretty good

2483.52 --> 2490.079
analogy for their fictitious

2487.04 --> 2494.64
claims about the dangers of viruses it's

2490.079 --> 2497.599
a pretty good comparison i think

2494.64 --> 2500.64
because everybody knows nails yeah you

2497.599 --> 2502.8
got nails everybody's born with nails

2500.64 --> 2509.04
nails can get you issues nails can

2502.8 --> 2510.88
reveal your diet etc etc your health

2509.04 --> 2514.0
now to claim then that there are like

2510.88 --> 2517.04
this potentially dangerous

2514.0 --> 2518.24
external agents when you're literally

2517.04 --> 2522.4
born with them

2518.24 --> 2526.0789999999997
that's absurd isn't it

2522.4 --> 2526.4
so if you're born with virus particles

2526.079 --> 2530.88
as

2526.4 --> 2534.64
part of your inner metabolic system

2530.88 --> 2537.839
to declare them to be an infectious

2534.64 --> 2551.68
dangerous agent is similarly

2537.839 --> 2565.839
absurd in my opinion

2551.68 --> 2565.839
allegory is an allegory right

2581.599 --> 2588.6400000000003
okay i'll help you out right now

2585.44 --> 2588.64
stop wasting my time

2590.4 --> 2593.839
hey style in 80 12.

2594.0 --> 2597.119
good similarity

2598.0 --> 2604.8
right but similarity is a description

2601.52 --> 2608.56
of its elements and an allegory

2604.8 --> 2608.5600000000004
what is now i that word

2615.76 --> 2619.28
story poem picture that can be

2617.119 --> 2620.0
interpreted to reveal hidden meaning

2619.28 --> 2623.0400000000004
typical

2620.0 --> 2624.0
moral or political one right it's

2623.04 --> 2625.839
different

2624.0 --> 2628.0
it's more remote it's not a more it's

2625.839 --> 2631.2799999999997
not an exit

2628.0 --> 2631.28
a direct example

2631.68 --> 2636.3999999999996
it's more situationally similar

2638.88 --> 2644.319
right so the similarities more in the

2640.88 --> 2644.319
spirit of the situation

2644.4 --> 2649.839
than in its form

2650.24 --> 2664.8799999999997
right in an analogy

2662.8 --> 2666.48
is a comparison between one thing and

2664.88 --> 2669.52
another typically for the purpose of

2666.48 --> 2669.839
explanation or clarification right well

2669.52 --> 2672.56
then

2669.839 --> 2673.7599999999998
the analogy would be the better

2672.56 --> 2676.7999999999997
designation

2673.76 --> 2680.3190000000004
for what i just described with the nails

2676.8 --> 2684.0
the danger of nails

2680.319 --> 2685.119
right now i i like to clear up these

2684.0 --> 2687.839
things right

2685.119 --> 2690.56
dutch is actually my primary language

2687.839 --> 2692.7999999999997
english is not

2690.56 --> 2694.48
so a lot of these words like i know how

2692.8 --> 2696.48
it's been used

2694.48 --> 2698.0
i know where these types of words

2696.48 --> 2701.04
typically pop up

2698.0 --> 2703.2
but it's really good to basically get

2701.04 --> 2707.7599999999998
back to school learning format

2703.2 --> 2709.4399999999996
on the small scale and really clarify

2707.76 --> 2711.599
for me right it's not even that i'm

2709.44 --> 2713.52
necessarily doing this for the audience

2711.599 --> 2715.04
i know most of you probably know this

2713.52 --> 2717.599
much better

2715.04 --> 2720.56
i'm trying to get it more concise and

2717.599 --> 2720.56
clear in my mind

2720.96 --> 2724.56
so it's good to know the difference

2723.92 --> 2728.48
between an

2724.56 --> 2728.48
allegory and an analogy

2731.68 --> 2738.24
where the analogy is much more

2734.48 --> 2738.2400000000002
mechanical similarities

2738.56 --> 2747.839
and an allegory is much more a

2742.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
contextual similarity

2748.16 --> 2750.48
right

2754.079 --> 2761.8390000000004
sort of i might be a little off here

2772.839 --> 2775.839
huh

2800.16 --> 2806.64
he must eradicate the nails yeah slow

2803.359 --> 2806.64
bone buggy you get it

2815.119 --> 2820.2400000000002
we can bring justice upon them well no i

2817.76 --> 2820.2400000000002
don't know

2822.96 --> 2829.119
i don't know we can point it out though

2826.64 --> 2830.4
for starters i don't know if we can

2829.119 --> 2833.52
bring it

2830.4 --> 2833.52
you know because

2836.96 --> 2846.2400000000002
how would we do that and how would we

2840.24 --> 2849.2799999999997
escape stigma for it afterward

2846.24 --> 2850.0
right because all the relations to all

2849.28 --> 2852.7200000000003
these

2850.0 --> 2853.44
grabblers are going to complain and

2852.72 --> 2857.839
whine to

2853.44 --> 2858.64
no end they'll erect a whole new

2857.839 --> 2863.2
movement

2858.64 --> 2863.2
just to try to avenge

2863.68 --> 2873.68
the justice being brought on their

2867.119 --> 2887.839
on their prime players

2873.68 --> 2887.839
so i don't know

2889.359 --> 2892.88
i just know that i'm experienced a lot

2891.52 --> 2896.88
of emotional

2892.88 --> 2900.559
primal response to the situation

2896.88 --> 2904.0
like i'm getting really sick of it

2900.559 --> 2906.8
and to the point where i

2904.0 --> 2908.48
i just i just want to stop it and don't

2906.8 --> 2910.319
really care about the consequences

2908.48 --> 2912.839
anymore

2910.319 --> 2914.48
it's it's not really reached that just

2912.839 --> 2918.4
yet

2914.48 --> 2922.079
but i i don't you know even the whole

2918.4 --> 2924.559
nuremberg 2 talk

2922.079 --> 2925.8390000000004
that did yeah it's going around and it's

2924.559 --> 2929.44
totally applicable

2925.839 --> 2932.72
right yes it is who's gonna

2929.44 --> 2936.16
do that who's gonna actually

2932.72 --> 2939.68
make that happen i don't

2936.16 --> 2942.0
see it i don't see anybody

2939.68 --> 2944.48
left out there that's actually going to

2942.0 --> 2944.48
do that

2951.599 --> 2954.96
the corruption seems

2955.119 --> 2958.7200000000003
so overwhelming i don't know who's

2957.68 --> 2963.2
actually going to be

2958.72 --> 2966.7999999999997
left to do the nuremberg

2963.2 --> 2970.319
too i mean they're not going to be made

2966.8 --> 2972.48
to do it on themselves that wouldn't

2970.319 --> 2975.2
make any sense unless they needed

2972.48 --> 2977.28
to like move on quickly create a

2975.2 --> 2978.0789999999997
scapegoat so everybody can forget about

2977.28 --> 2981.3590000000004
it

2978.079 --> 2981.3590000000004
sacrifice a few

2981.839 --> 2986.64
of the more annoying

2985.04 --> 2988.64
people of them or the ones that have

2986.64 --> 2991.1189999999997
basically offered to be the fall guy

2988.64 --> 2992.0789999999997
so they can move on everybody comes down

2991.119 --> 2995.28
a little

2992.079 --> 2998.7200000000003
and then they unroll the next plan and

2995.28 --> 3000.48
with they i mean exactly the same people

2998.72 --> 3002.72
now doing this [ __ ]

3000.48 --> 3002.72
right

3011.28 --> 3015.3590000000004
it's gonna be the same people i i don't

3014.0 --> 3017.68
see them going i don't

3015.359 --> 3019.68
see them getting massively arrested like

3017.68 --> 3023.359
who's gonna do that

3019.68 --> 3025.44
the people doing arrests are doing their

3023.359 --> 3027.7599999999998
bidding

3025.44 --> 3030.2400000000002
how are we gonna arrest them who's gonna

3027.76 --> 3030.2400000000002
do this

3030.8 --> 3034.1600000000003
that's a serious question

3038.88 --> 3043.52
because if you just leave it to the ones

3040.96 --> 3048.079
doing it

3043.52 --> 3051.44
doing all these crazy evil

3048.079 --> 3052.8
actions out there all they're gonna be

3051.44 --> 3055.839
doing

3052.8 --> 3057.119
is just find the fall guy to satisfy the

3055.839 --> 3060.4
wider public

3057.119 --> 3062.6400000000003
with some form of justice vengeance

3060.4 --> 3064.7200000000003
so everybody will be satisfied with just

3062.64 --> 3065.92
a few people that will get the blame for

3064.72 --> 3068.3999999999996
everything

3065.92 --> 3071.839
to fall and go to prison forever who

3068.4 --> 3075.119
knows maybe be executed whatever

3071.839 --> 3076.0789999999997
and then the same people will stay in

3075.119 --> 3079.76
power

3076.079 --> 3083.119
and then engage in enrolling a new plan

3079.76 --> 3097.599
just as shitty just as strong

3083.119 --> 3100.559
as this crap right

3097.599 --> 3102.96
do you guys see the problem that i'm

3100.559 --> 3102.96
seeing

3103.2 --> 3109.7599999999998
or am i exaggerating

3107.68 --> 3111.52
the corruption is it not

3109.76 --> 3112.8
all-encompassing i mean there's

3111.52 --> 3115.2
individuals in

3112.8 --> 3116.88
like with doctors and politicians that

3115.2 --> 3120.3999999999996
are like

3116.88 --> 3123.599
trying to be a positional but can they

3120.4 --> 3127.92
actually do it

3123.599 --> 3130.319
can they actually do all these things

3127.92 --> 3130.319
you know

3131.119 --> 3134.4
that's an important question to ask is

3133.28 --> 3137.2000000000003
it mechanically

3134.4 --> 3138.4
technically possible for them to

3137.2 --> 3140.8799999999997
actually

3138.4 --> 3142.8
bring justice to this entire situation

3140.88 --> 3144.96
could they do it

3142.8 --> 3146.079
now whether they're gonna do it is

3144.96 --> 3150.16
another matter but

3146.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
could they do it i don't know

3150.16 --> 3153.839
i don't know anymore

3192.839 --> 3197.119
right

3194.319 --> 3199.2799999999997
and yeah my conclusions are pretty

3197.119 --> 3202.8
dramatic

3199.28 --> 3205.92
and sometimes i shine through

3202.8 --> 3208.7200000000003
like what what i think should happen but

3205.92 --> 3210.559
i don't see it happening it's like

3208.72 --> 3212.16
it's not of this time it's not gonna

3210.559 --> 3213.2000000000003
happen it should happen it's not

3212.16 --> 3214.96
happening

3213.2 --> 3217.2
like all these people that are

3214.96 --> 3219.44
surrendered to corruption

3217.2 --> 3220.8799999999997
they should be taken down and that's

3219.44 --> 3223.92
like a whole

3220.88 --> 3227.76
range of people in many groups

3223.92 --> 3230.7200000000003
police forces justice system politics

3227.76 --> 3232.4
media for crying out loud freaking media

3230.72 --> 3235.4399999999996
people man

3232.4 --> 3237.839
right but

3235.44 --> 3237.839
how

3238.88 --> 3244.8
like if that happens everything falls

3242.24 --> 3246.0
and they will make it fall they the

3244.8 --> 3248.48
people that are now

3246.0 --> 3249.52
the problem in control they will make it

3248.48 --> 3252.96
fall

3249.52 --> 3256.0
they will point at people finally taking

3252.96 --> 3256.0
serious action

3257.52 --> 3262.24
and then they'll just scream and scream

3259.76 --> 3266.6400000000003
and scream until people start

3262.24 --> 3266.64
sending in drones and blowing [ __ ] up

3267.599 --> 3274.559
they will not they will like scream

3270.96 --> 3277.04
at the top of their lungs at the camera

3274.559 --> 3277.6800000000003
like kill them kill them kill them they

3277.04 --> 3280.5589999999997
will just

3277.68 --> 3282.72
let everything go completely ape [ __ ]

3280.559 --> 3285.119
insane

3282.72 --> 3285.1189999999997
it's like

3289.52 --> 3294.88
right every original advantage

3292.799 --> 3296.88
that was envisioned through sort of

3294.88 --> 3299.119
democracy system is like okay you

3296.88 --> 3300.6400000000003
protest and then media picks up on that

3299.119 --> 3304.079
and then they have to change something

3300.64 --> 3308.4
well guess what those times

3304.079 --> 3311.52
are completely behind us

3308.4 --> 3315.44
media doesn't do that anymore

3311.52 --> 3318.24
media is a propaganda machine now

3315.44 --> 3318.96
they're all bound by strict party

3318.24 --> 3322.4799999999996
guideline

3318.96 --> 3325.839
rules right enforced by

3322.48 --> 3325.839
the corporate structure

3328.319 --> 3333.04
they don't do that anymore so none of

3330.72 --> 3334.64
the original functions of like okay

3333.04 --> 3336.88
people come together we're gonna do

3334.64 --> 3337.839
something it doesn't apply anymore we're

3336.88 --> 3341.119
now

3337.839 --> 3345.04
not in that position anymore we are now

3341.119 --> 3345.04
more comparable to

3345.52 --> 3351.04
cows and oxes in a slave pen

3348.96 --> 3352.2400000000002
and we could kind of break out and

3351.04 --> 3355.7599999999998
stampede

3352.24 --> 3357.68
the cowboys right but that's

3355.76 --> 3360.0
not gonna really fix things that's just

3357.68 --> 3361.839
gonna create more chaos really but it'll

3360.0 --> 3363.92
stop the imprisonment and the

3361.839 --> 3365.839
mistreatment that might be going on

3363.92 --> 3367.28
but that's now more the position that

3365.839 --> 3370.799
we're all facing

3367.28 --> 3373.92
worldwide than originally where

3370.799 --> 3377.44
yeah if you would go and protest then

3373.92 --> 3380.079
that would kind of push politics to

3377.44 --> 3381.92
to change things i don't see it

3380.079 --> 3385.6800000000003
happening anymore

3381.92 --> 3389.52
now they just hire people

3385.68 --> 3393.359
to create the the illusion

3389.52 --> 3396.16
of a change that is needed

3393.359 --> 3397.04
by them and then they use those

3396.16 --> 3399.92
scenarios

3397.04 --> 3400.64
amplify them through media connections

3399.92 --> 3404.4
and then

3400.64 --> 3407.5989999999997
just go for that let it happen

3404.4 --> 3408.88
right when nobody wanted that that's

3407.599 --> 3411.599
what they do now

3408.88 --> 3413.28
okay right so this original idea oh

3411.599 --> 3414.079
we're just gonna protest that's gonna

3413.28 --> 3416.4
change things

3414.079 --> 3417.44
yeah good luck with that you're you're

3416.4 --> 3421.2000000000003
kind of like

3417.44 --> 3423.52
20 to 50 years too late with that crap

3421.2 --> 3426.319
right doesn't work anymore so what are

3423.52 --> 3430.72
we gonna do now

3426.319 --> 3433.839
right maybe there really is nothing left

3430.72 --> 3434.319
nothing but to break out of the pen and

3433.839 --> 3437.92
just

3434.319 --> 3441.2
stampede the [ __ ] out of these freaking

3437.92 --> 3442.88
increasingly more sadistic cowboys

3441.2 --> 3444.8799999999997
right maybe that's the only thing that's

3442.88 --> 3447.599
left right now i can't think of any

3444.88 --> 3450.559
other

3447.599 --> 3450.559
way through this

3455.04 --> 3460.88
maybe it just has to become total

3458.079 --> 3462.7200000000003
[ __ ] chaos

3460.88 --> 3465.04
to make us all remember what's real

3462.72 --> 3465.04
again

3470.0 --> 3473.839
this is all by the way extremely

3471.44 --> 3476.4
hypothetical i'm not actually planning

3473.839 --> 3476.4
anything

3478.0 --> 3480.319
right

3484.799 --> 3489.119
but yes i have been thinking about this

3487.28 --> 3491.119
a lot

3489.119 --> 3493.04
and i'm very conflicted about the whole

3491.119 --> 3495.04
situation this is resting on my

3493.04 --> 3498.0
shoulders

3495.04 --> 3500.079
and i reflect upon other people like

3498.0 --> 3502.079
owen benjamin has some things to say he

3500.079 --> 3504.0
has some wisdom in a very specific type

3502.079 --> 3507.28
of corner about it

3504.0 --> 3509.599
you have to listen and

3507.28 --> 3513.599
even in his own way like alex jones

3509.599 --> 3516.799
still very much a system believer

3513.599 --> 3519.599
also has input and all kinds of people

3516.799 --> 3519.599
have input

3524.16 --> 3531.359
but yeah the scenario i presented i

3526.64 --> 3534.5589999999997
think that's really going on it's like

3531.359 --> 3538.0
the gates have closed

3534.559 --> 3540.7200000000003
they're closed we're cattle now whether

3538.0 --> 3542.799
but we still have some muscle as cattle

3540.72 --> 3545.1189999999997
we haven't all been completely

3542.799 --> 3546.0
fattened up and weakened i mean some of

3545.119 --> 3550.1600000000003
the cattle

3546.0 --> 3552.0
are but there's some still some healthy

3550.16 --> 3554.319
specimens in there so there is still

3552.0 --> 3558.079
kind of a chance to break out

3554.319 --> 3562.24
and just use the the herd instinct

3558.079 --> 3565.119
to start a stampede right

3562.24 --> 3565.1189999999997
and that's about it

3565.359 --> 3573.839
so very metaphorical

3570.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
by the way

3577.359 --> 3580.88
yeah it would only make things worse but

3580.24 --> 3584.0789999999997
muslim

3580.88 --> 3588.2400000000002
mu buggy then at the same time what if

3584.079 --> 3591.52
nothing happened isn't that

3588.24 --> 3594.319
palpably probably foreseeably

3591.52 --> 3597.7599999999998
gonna make things a lot worse what if we

3594.319 --> 3597.7599999999998
all become too weak and too

3597.92 --> 3604.559
subjected to this garbage that no

3601.52 --> 3615.839
cow is strong enough to break through

3604.559 --> 3615.8390000000004
the gates anymore what do we do then

3626.839 --> 3629.839
uh

3640.839 --> 3643.839
so

3653.359 --> 3660.16
all right yeah george sanford right

3656.88 --> 3664.0
you know well look

3660.16 --> 3667.92
if a system employs cops

3664.0 --> 3672.16
and other workers whatever

3667.92 --> 3672.16
that just blatantly violate

3672.559 --> 3678.079
logical conduct and start terrorizing

3675.68 --> 3680.8799999999997
citizens

3678.079 --> 3682.88
then yeah the system apparently thinks

3680.88 --> 3684.96
that that's okay now

3682.88 --> 3686.4
and that we should get used to it i

3684.96 --> 3689.04
think that

3686.4 --> 3690.559
there should be kept records of every

3689.04 --> 3693.44
freaking cop

3690.559 --> 3693.8390000000004
and psycho doctor that's very eager to

3693.44 --> 3696.48
you

3693.839 --> 3697.359
to euthanize people and everything that

3696.48 --> 3699.52
should just be

3697.359 --> 3701.04
kept a record like if the police and the

3699.52 --> 3701.599
justice system isn't going to do that

3701.04 --> 3704.96
anymore

3701.599 --> 3705.839
then the people should they should keep

3704.96 --> 3708.319
track of this

3705.839 --> 3710.839
to point at the individuals and then at

3708.319 --> 3713.359
some point

3710.839 --> 3715.52
somehow

3713.359 --> 3717.92
when the winds completely turn around or

3715.52 --> 3719.839
something i don't know how

3717.92 --> 3721.599
but hoping that there might be a moment

3719.839 --> 3723.2
like that and then suddenly all the

3721.599 --> 3724.88
records come out and then we can all

3723.2 --> 3727.52
point like these are the ones

3724.88 --> 3728.4
they are the those are the [ __ ] up

3727.52 --> 3730.0
people

3728.4 --> 3733.359
that are saying we're having a sneaky

3730.0 --> 3737.44
worst or we're just following artists

3733.359 --> 3740.64
get him and not leave it to the

3737.44 --> 3744.319
[ __ ] system again to say oh no it's

3740.64 --> 3747.52
just these people no no we're they

3744.319 --> 3750.079
are the only ones they're the only ones

3747.52 --> 3751.839
right you're just gonna have to forget

3750.079 --> 3754.96
about all those other people that

3751.839 --> 3759.7599999999998
completely misbehaved

3754.96 --> 3759.76
under guise of this just go like

3760.319 --> 3766.5589999999997
see we have to keep record we have to

3764.319 --> 3767.599
know who these corrupted messed up

3766.559 --> 3772.96
people are

3767.599 --> 3772.96
the individuals track record

3773.039 --> 3777.5200000000004
know their deeds don't forget it

3780.0 --> 3786.4
right you can't trust on agencies

3783.52 --> 3787.7599999999998
and governments anymore to do that for

3786.4 --> 3790.559
you

3787.76 --> 3793.119
we have to know who they are the

3790.559 --> 3793.44
corrupted governments and police forces

3793.119 --> 3796.799
are

3793.44 --> 3798.64
covering for these people now

3796.799 --> 3801.119
and maybe when things get too hot they

3798.64 --> 3802.4
just get like like oh you're just fired

3801.119 --> 3804.0
so we don't have to

3802.4 --> 3807.039
deal with it anymore they're not gonna

3804.0 --> 3807.039
get justice for it

3808.839 --> 3812.48
right

3810.24 --> 3815.1189999999997
we have to keep track of it that's how i

3812.48 --> 3815.119
feel about it

3819.68 --> 3825.839
and i bet there's a whole bunch of

3821.359 --> 3825.839
people out there already doing this

3826.72 --> 3831.0389999999998
and they'd never have to tell anyone

3829.2 --> 3833.68
they're doing it

3831.039 --> 3835.2000000000003
just have to keep it secret keep it safe

3833.68 --> 3839.839
until the time is right

3835.2 --> 3839.839
and then the records can be brought out

3861.119 --> 3868.88
small local community council right

3867.039 --> 3870.1600000000003
well right yeah you gotta first then

3868.88 --> 3874.079
form such small

3870.16 --> 3876.16
local community though gaining wisdom

3874.079 --> 3877.3590000000004
or find one that has not already been

3876.16 --> 3880.0
corrupted because

3877.359 --> 3882.4
yes small local communities can be

3880.0 --> 3885.599
subjected to corruption as well and will

3882.4 --> 3885.599
they all deal with it

3887.92 --> 3891.359
you know there's no guarantee just

3889.599 --> 3894.2400000000002
because it's a small community doesn't

3891.359 --> 3909.839
mean that it can't be corrupted

3894.24 --> 3909.839
that would be over simplifying

3918.96 --> 3922.0
sometimes i wonder if christianity is

3921.359 --> 3925.52
the tool for

3922.0 --> 3927.76
this the sun has received all power in

3925.52 --> 3931.119
heaven and earth

3927.76 --> 3931.119
has also the power to ju

3933.119 --> 3937.28
so are you talking about deities or are

3935.52 --> 3939.799
you talking about people calling

3937.28 --> 3942.799
themselves christians because

3939.799 --> 3942.799
christianity

3943.599 --> 3949.119
has gone sliding down a hill

3946.64 --> 3953.52
for a long long time there is very

3949.119 --> 3953.52
little left of the original logos now

3953.599 --> 3958.799
right sometimes i mockingly call it [ __ ]

3956.559 --> 3961.8390000000004
christianity because that's exactly what

3958.799 --> 3964.16
it's become in so many ways and they all

3961.839 --> 3966.0
bicker about it but like we have to

3964.16 --> 3968.5589999999997
adapt we have to be

3966.0 --> 3969.359
modern we have to be more according to

3968.559 --> 3972.48
what freaking

3969.359 --> 3976.839
government tells you you've weirdos

3972.48 --> 3979.2
no and that's a big problem

3976.839 --> 3982.64
christianity

3979.2 --> 3984.8799999999997
right so are we i call myself a

3982.64 --> 3986.64
christian and i'm not perfect i try to

3984.88 --> 3989.2000000000003
be though i try to be very pure

3986.64 --> 3990.72
very straightforward admit when

3989.2 --> 3992.0
something is wrong doesn't mean that

3990.72 --> 3995.359
i'll be able to stop

3992.0 --> 3999.039
it necessarily but at least i will know

3995.359 --> 4001.92
what is what and i will not fool myself

3999.039 --> 4002.2400000000002
and seduce myself into more of what i

4001.92 --> 4005.359
know

4002.24 --> 4006.8799999999997
is wrong right that's a

4005.359 --> 4010.319
that would be a great start for

4006.88 --> 4010.319
christianity in general

4015.92 --> 4021.839
yeah well dutch sailor look we're not in

4018.839 --> 4021.839
asia

4025.119 --> 4035.839
hey tony whitcomb

4039.92 --> 4042.2400000000002
hmm

4046.799 --> 4049.839
son of man

4049.92 --> 4065.599
huh okay antony

4062.96 --> 4067.52
really is specific son of man shall come

4065.599 --> 4071.28
in the glory of his father and this

4067.52 --> 4071.28
wow that huh

4071.599 --> 4079.119
i do not fully know the context of that

4075.359 --> 4081.7599999999998
piece of scripture but that does sound

4079.119 --> 4081.76
interesting

4087.359 --> 4092.72
crusades had all the fun well tomorrow

4089.359 --> 4092.72
don't be too sure about that

4093.039 --> 4096.0
crusades were

4096.159 --> 4099.679
part of a massive gravel

4101.199 --> 4107.04
remember the crusades in its own right

4104.4 --> 4110.879999999999
was kind of like a

4107.04 --> 4114.159
a world war solution

4110.88 --> 4117.52
to the well

4114.159 --> 4119.12
the pinnacle of theocracy

4117.52 --> 4121.52
it was kind of in the middle of their

4119.12 --> 4124.5599999999995
pinnacle of power

4121.52 --> 4127.4400000000005
and they did that to maintain it

4124.56 --> 4130.96
i think right so was it all that were

4127.44 --> 4130.96
the crusades all that christian

4131.6 --> 4137.52
i know it was under the guise of it was

4134.239 --> 4137.5199999999995
it really all that christian

4140.08 --> 4149.199
i mean i'm not saying that all of it

4144.08 --> 4149.199
was just political evil or anything but

4150.319 --> 4161.839000000001
it was definitely gravel in many ways

4154.719 --> 4161.839
the organization of it

4181.44 --> 4184.5599999999995
okay george sanford well that all

4183.04 --> 4186.48
depends on like

4184.56 --> 4187.6
what the cops are like in your region

4186.48 --> 4190.639999999999
over here they're

4187.6 --> 4190.64
they're pretty fair

4192.96 --> 4196.96
so i don't know what they're like over

4194.48 --> 4203.839999999999
there where you're at

4196.96 --> 4203.84
so i'm not gonna judge that

4227.199 --> 4233.759999999999
what tony what what

4231.6 --> 4235.76
okay so they wanted their police

4233.76 --> 4237.92
vehicles to have

4235.76 --> 4240.64
word police in welsh i don't see the

4237.92 --> 4240.64
problem with that

4243.76 --> 4247.12
i mean if they're still gonna look like

4245.36 --> 4247.679
police cars i don't see the problem

4247.12 --> 4250.0
there

4247.679 --> 4252.0
right like unless their design is

4250.0 --> 4254.239
completely different then it might get a

4252.0 --> 4259.84
little confusing

4254.239 --> 4259.839999999999
but yeah

4276.48 --> 4283.04
i don't know why these fruit flies hang

4278.96 --> 4283.04
around there there's literally no fruit

4284.84 --> 4287.84
anywhere

4296.96 --> 4300.88
okay well that must have been a really

4298.88 --> 4303.12
british joke then because i didn't see

4300.88 --> 4305.679
how that was a joke

4303.12 --> 4307.04
tony whitcomb so yeah i did indeed fail

4305.679 --> 4308.88
to see the joke

4307.04 --> 4310.48
or maybe i just didn't think it was all

4308.88 --> 4315.84
that funny

4310.48 --> 4315.839999999999
i'm not a local i don't get it

4326.84 --> 4329.84
right

4346.15 --> 4351.228999999999
[Music]

4362.08 --> 4373.93
you call them

4370.82 --> 4373.929999999999
[Music]

4396.84 --> 4401.360000000001
yes

4398.239 --> 4402.799999999999
well single gaming player gaming it's

4401.36 --> 4405.199
not so much that

4402.8 --> 4406.96
it's just that i think i get the joke i

4405.199 --> 4408.96
just didn't think it was funny i don't

4406.96 --> 4413.84
think beer's gonna help me make it

4408.96 --> 4413.84
make me think it's funny too so

4415.92 --> 4419.679
how long have i had this show well look

4418.32 --> 4423.12
why don't you look

4419.679 --> 4423.52
it's episode number 950 you do the math

4423.12 --> 4427.84
how

4423.52 --> 4427.84
how long do you think it's been around

4429.44 --> 4441.839999999999
it's just a wordplay on police and lies

4433.44 --> 4441.839999999999
okay i still don't get it

4446.719 --> 4452.2390000000005
literally if it's a wordplay then i'm

4450.0 --> 4454.48
then the entire joke indeed has

4452.239 --> 4456.718999999999
completely eluded me

4454.48 --> 4460.239
there was maybe some cultural connection

4456.719 --> 4460.2390000000005
there that i am not aware of

4464.96 --> 4470.56
how often do i broadcast every single

4467.04 --> 4472.4
day wandering soul every single day

4470.56 --> 4474.400000000001
with the early bird show that is before

4472.4 --> 4483.839999999999
that i did the flat earth talks

4474.4 --> 4483.839999999999
and that was kind of a weekly thing

4493.44 --> 4497.12
yeah my channel has been around since

4498.26 --> 4502.359
[Music]

4508.84 --> 4511.84
2016.

4526.159 --> 4532.0
what hey hello old horsery redbound i

4528.88 --> 4532.0
don't know who that is

4533.84 --> 4538.32
i don't know if that's a good thing or a

4536.32 --> 4541.36
bad thing to compare me with that person

4538.32 --> 4541.36
i don't know who he is

4549.84 --> 4554.2390000000005
can i make a living from my show with

4551.92 --> 4557.1990000000005
all the subscribers

4554.239 --> 4558.32
but sir it's helping me but no i can't

4557.199 --> 4567.839999999999
make a full out

4558.32 --> 4567.84
living from it so far

4571.44 --> 4575.44
but i have gained more support over the

4574.239 --> 4577.44
years

4575.44 --> 4581.04
so i'm certainly doing a lot better now

4577.44 --> 4585.12
than i did then

4581.04 --> 4585.12
have much less financial problems on

4592.84 --> 4597.92
average

4595.76 --> 4599.04
the baseball player who played the most

4597.92 --> 4602.56
consecutive

4599.04 --> 4605.76
games in a row okay okay

4602.56 --> 4610.2390000000005
never miss the game well i

4605.76 --> 4613.76
i have missed the game though i have had

4610.239 --> 4613.759999999999
times where i didn't stream

4617.199 --> 4621.36
but i don't know you could count those

4619.28 --> 4625.599999999999
on on a single hand i think

4621.36 --> 4628.96
maybe two right and for 950 shows i

4625.6 --> 4628.96
don't think that's very bad

4630.56 --> 4634.88
i've always made work of it to basically

4632.88 --> 4637.84
do the show no matter what my condition

4634.88 --> 4637.84
is

4650.32 --> 4665.84
right okay

4676.84 --> 4679.84
so

4680.0 --> 4686.4
oh oh

4683.52 --> 4688.080000000001
okay thank you for explaining that to me

4686.4 --> 4690.4
apparently i do still have some

4688.08 --> 4694.88
lingering vaccine damage because only

4690.4 --> 4694.879999999999
now do i see what what the joke was

4703.199 --> 4710.159
right that's

4706.4 --> 4720.879999999999
yeah i get it it's a split words

4710.159 --> 4724.719
thing right i didn't see that at all

4720.88 --> 4727.04
what would be your perfect job of dude

4724.719 --> 4727.04
dude

4732.84 --> 4735.84
i

4741.679 --> 4751.1990000000005
i don't know man

4748.08 --> 4754.8
so far this has been my most successful

4751.199 --> 4757.04
job in my life

4754.8 --> 4757.04
right

4760.48 --> 4764.879999999999
certainly have the motivation i have the

4762.719 --> 4767.92
skill range

4764.88 --> 4767.92
i have the time

4771.52 --> 4776.080000000001
and hey it's it's not left me completely

4774.96 --> 4778.8
poor

4776.08 --> 4778.8
or anything

4779.36 --> 4783.28
right i financially i was doing a lot

4782.0 --> 4787.12
worse before i

4783.28 --> 4791.84
started doing this then i do

4787.12 --> 4791.84
then i'm doing right now

4803.84 --> 4807.729
[Music]

4809.36 --> 4819.839999999999
pole ice antarctica

4826.8 --> 4832.0
you could make a really silly joke with

4828.639 --> 4834.639
that now that you mention it

4832.0 --> 4836.159
but it's silly i i couldn't make it work

4834.639 --> 4839.28
on the spot

4836.159 --> 4841.199
but you could joke around like oh our

4839.28 --> 4847.04
police forces have

4841.199 --> 4849.36
after all the riots we suffered too many

4847.04 --> 4851.12
too many hospitalizations of our police

4849.36 --> 4856.4
forces we need to

4851.12 --> 4856.4
import police and then like okay

4857.52 --> 4863.92
and then yeah a giant truck arrives

4861.12 --> 4864.48
with giant blocks of eyes and it's like

4863.92 --> 4867.12
okay

4864.48 --> 4870.5599999999995
it took a lot of effort to get this but

4867.12 --> 4872.5599999999995
we got it we got your pole eyes

4870.56 --> 4875.84
it sounds really stupid when i say it

4872.56 --> 4875.84
like that

4878.639 --> 4889.84
i think somebody could do a better job

4880.88 --> 4889.84
at it

4895.71 --> 4898.909
[Music]

4928.84 --> 4931.84

4934.0 --> 4937.84
