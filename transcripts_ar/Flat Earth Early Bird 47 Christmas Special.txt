4.16 --> 11.759
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.34 --> 19.07
early-bird number number 47

11.759 --> 19.07
I'm your host Arwen and Merry Christmas

28.89 --> 41.66
yeah like this alright so yeah I've been

37.7 --> 45.63
watching the Christmas episode

41.66 --> 49.64
well Nathan Oakley it's a restream from

45.63 --> 51.660000000000004
I think this yeah from last year and

49.64 --> 55.11
yesterday I think it was just the

51.66 --> 58.169999999999995
evening it's a restream was that even

55.11 --> 66.3
before this I'm not sure if they were

58.17 --> 68.19
all in sequence or that they were no

66.3 --> 70.41
they were a whole last year right that

68.19 --> 74.509
that would this is basically the second

70.41 --> 79.71
Christmas on the Flat Earth debates

74.509 --> 83.07
anyway yeah that was really fascinating

79.71 --> 90.24
to see really really fascinating because

83.07 --> 92.729
that was the debate that just stopped I

90.24 --> 98.36
don't know if he's still playing let's

92.729 --> 98.36
see if you're still going but

101.1 --> 110.58
I was basically describing technically

104.97 --> 113.43
describing the optical slant and it was

110.58 --> 117.72
just so awesome to see that even though

113.43 --> 123.57000000000001
I was still digging digging through it

117.72 --> 128.009
all I was so on target and even the

123.57 --> 131.039
words were almost on target like call it

128.009 --> 133.92
like yeah its perspective induced it's

131.039 --> 136.70899999999997
like the limited perspective and that

133.92 --> 139.89
turns out to be the the limit to the

136.709 --> 144.03
viewing angle which is directly related

139.89 --> 150.45
to perspective it is so it's just so

144.03 --> 153.209
awesome to see that a year ago I was on

150.45 --> 156.81
to something and I could already see so

153.209 --> 160.8
much of it just didn't really wasn't

156.81 --> 163.11
really sure didn't have a lot of

160.8 --> 167.34
reference it's not a lot of data to fall

163.11 --> 172.34
back on and we have in the mean time so

167.34 --> 179.88
it's really good to see this yeah and

172.34 --> 186.99
yeah it does make me proud so

179.88 --> 191.16
good morning Oh Oh do black FPV and here

186.99 --> 196.32000000000002
for now yeah Merry Christmas and Happy

191.16 --> 200.0
Holidays and all that so many different

196.32 --> 200.0
names for the same holiday

204.34 --> 208.42000000000002
it's pretty nice weather by the way out

206.47 --> 212.819
there is a little bit cloudy right now

208.42 --> 212.819
but there was really nice morning some

217.45 --> 225.23899999999998
yeah got plenty of food weirdly enough

221.05 --> 225.239
I've been gorging a bit then yesterday

225.69 --> 230.819
yeah I don't know what that is with

228.069 --> 230.819
response but

233.99 --> 240.19
just need little extra try not to overdo

238.04 --> 240.19
it

244.46 --> 250.24
but yeah overall things are good and

247.24 --> 250.24
interesting

250.7 --> 253.78
for me

254.23 --> 258.71999999999997
and I have a bit of

260.4 --> 264.44899999999996
Christmas jitter so you could call it I

263.04 --> 269.88
don't know I don't know Matt how many

264.449 --> 272.55
people have this that during Christmas I

269.88 --> 275.96999999999997
get really nervous it's almost like

272.55 --> 279.15000000000003
stage fright but yeah it doesn't me

275.97 --> 280.68
really make a lot of sense because yeah

279.15 --> 285.06
I'm just going to my dad's and my

280.68 --> 286.77
stepmom and they're really awesome and

285.06 --> 288.99
they really know me and they know

286.77 --> 290.96999999999997
flatterer that now Oh everything you

288.99 --> 296.34000000000003
know everything about me and the

290.97 --> 298.97900000000004
troubles I deal with and and despite

296.34 --> 302.21999999999997
this I don't allow myself to behave too

298.979 --> 305.729
much like a teenager around them you can

302.22 --> 309.949
even though that that need tends to

305.729 --> 314.15999999999997
arise when I really connect with people

309.949 --> 317.099
it's like breathing but anyway yeah I'm

314.16 --> 319.65000000000003
an adult so I have to keep myself in

317.099 --> 324.24
check in that sense but I always get

319.65 --> 326.039
nervous for this and I even had times

324.24 --> 328.229
that I almost had like a nervous

326.039 --> 331.11
breakdown like a like almost like a

328.229 --> 333.63
panic attack because of things I was

331.11 --> 335.49
dealing with and always during Christmas

333.63 --> 337.68
if there's a lot of stuff that's

335.49 --> 340.65000000000003
happened that is very shocking to me or

337.68 --> 343.58
very painful it tends to come back

340.65 --> 347.21
during Christmas

343.58 --> 350.21
it's very inconvenient but I don't know

347.21 --> 357.21999999999997
maybe it has something to do with being

350.21 --> 360.68
confronted with with family and you know

357.22 --> 363.8
the family tension kind of thing and I

360.68 --> 366.53000000000003
guess that if you experience this every

363.8 --> 370.79
time again and again every year during

366.53 --> 376.07
the same timing then it might become

370.79 --> 379.67
like a conditioned thing it's like your

376.07 --> 382.25
spirit will be conditioned to be

379.67 --> 385.04
prepared for that thing like a ritual

382.25 --> 388.34
like a change in energies and everything

385.04 --> 391.76000000000005
to happen because you need to adapt

388.34 --> 395.45
because it's so strained for so then it

391.76 --> 398.89
becomes and grinded in your being very

395.45 --> 403.64
specifically timed to that clock and

398.89 --> 405.16999999999996
yeah that may explain it because yeah I

403.64 --> 407.65
did have a lot of friction with my

405.17 --> 407.65000000000003
family

408.1 --> 416.81
judgments great and yeah I did act a bit

413.57 --> 419.26
out because of it so that didn't help a

416.81 --> 419.26
lot either

419.639 --> 425.819
yeah so that could explain it a bit I

423.78 --> 429.35999999999996
don't know maybe some other people have

425.819 --> 435.74
have like Christmas nerves and jitters

429.36 --> 438.74
as well I don't know let's see I'm just

435.74 --> 438.74
wondering

439.74 --> 446.99
how do I hand out a link

452.74 --> 458.08
yeah anyway I'm still trying out OBS

456.01 --> 464.95
again now I know how to properly start

458.08 --> 467.14
it up but I can't seem to even though I

464.95 --> 476.26
am streaming directly there is no

467.14 --> 479.02
hangout link that I can see nor is there

476.26 --> 485.21999999999997
a back chat weird I don't know why that

479.02 --> 485.21999999999997
is need to work on it I guess

488.319 --> 500.58000000000004
what anyway hello JJ mark of Mel yeah I

497.83 --> 500.58
sense there

503.23 --> 508.87
yeah

505.84 --> 510.82
it was kind of bright so I thought okay

508.87 --> 512.979
with the bright lights that thing in the

510.82 --> 516.25
background it's not gonna bother anyone

512.979 --> 520.599
too much but now it's kind of gotten

516.25 --> 523.75
cloudy all of a sudden so yeah and it it

520.599 --> 526.44
is kind of cold up so not really

523.75 --> 530.279
terribly cold but still cold enough that

526.44 --> 530.2790000000001
I want to heater on

537.14 --> 543.15
P Morris

539.74 --> 543.15
I hope you're doing okay

543.8 --> 553.06
are you gonna visit any family Pete

546.2 --> 553.0600000000001
Morris a mr. flat curve

564.629 --> 574.0790000000001
yeah you know what I've got a little

568.42 --> 574.079
drawing let's see

574.55 --> 585.0999999999999
a conceptualization of the rectangular

577.76 --> 595.1899999999999
looping earth with a oscillating

585.1 --> 598.269
north-south order see I can do this I

595.19 --> 598.269
can do this

610.77 --> 612.8
Oh

619.58 --> 624.63
right

622.03 --> 624.63
so

636.92 --> 650.4399999999999
sorry not so quick yet anyway this is a

641.959 --> 650.4399999999999
very rough sketch concept

659.53 --> 664.61
and yeah

662.3 --> 670.2199999999999
I hope this clears things up this is

664.61 --> 673.61
still a looping con fine so as I

670.22 --> 677.0600000000001
explained earlier what you see here is

673.61 --> 686.35
the earth realm that we know and it will

677.06 --> 688.67
loop this is a linear flat surface or

686.35 --> 691.5500000000001
that's what it's supposed to look like

688.67 --> 697.91
it look I improvised kind of sloppily

691.55 --> 701.3
and scan it and everything it is shown

697.91 --> 704.89
in a perspective view though but this is

701.3 --> 707.66
an artificial designer's eye because

704.89 --> 709.399
yeah this is in a looping confinement

707.66 --> 711.8299999999999
you can't actually be outside of it you

709.399 --> 717.22
can actually see the loop it would

711.83 --> 719.6600000000001
rather result in well it it just weirdly

717.22 --> 723.14
continued it would look warped and

719.66 --> 726.4399999999999
surreal if you could even see anything

723.14 --> 730.01
like this I suggest that if you'd look

726.44 --> 734.7790000000001
at a distance enough to see it like this

730.01 --> 737.649
you would just see a giant floor of

734.779 --> 737.649
white mist

739.49 --> 746.629
like it well like an eternal plane

741.889 --> 750.769
because it would be echoing because it

746.629 --> 753.019
is looping so it will be echoing but

750.769 --> 754.61
yeah because of the lack of air clarity

753.019 --> 758.869
from the distance you would just see a

754.61 --> 762.85
big blur all over it you couldn't even

758.869 --> 765.529
see that parts are seemingly looping

762.85 --> 767.749
that they are repeating and within sight

765.529 --> 770.99
because it's all blurred up another

767.749 --> 779.629
trick from the Creator if this is

770.99 --> 782.9590000000001
actually what the earth is like but yeah

779.629 --> 786.9200000000001
what this is like the equator should be

782.959 --> 789.0189999999999
here roughly we know and that in I'm

786.92 --> 792.05
suggesting within this concept that the

789.019 --> 797.36
distance between the east and west loop

792.05 --> 800.899
is the largest here then if you go to

797.36 --> 805.369
the north you go to a point where the

800.899 --> 810.49
loop is the smallest and as you approach

805.369 --> 814.279
this it's very likely that because of

810.49 --> 816.889
the interconnectivity of this facial

814.279 --> 819.439
loop it would be suggested to the person

816.889 --> 822.529
orientating themselves over here on this

819.439 --> 825.29
flat piece that is still flat but just

822.529 --> 828.679
weirdly spatially looping in a regular

825.29 --> 832.73
way that they would be approaching the

828.679 --> 835.689
center of a disc that would be the

832.73 --> 839.47
result of that spatial interconnection

835.689 --> 844.3689999999999
but when they actually reach the center

839.47 --> 846.769
they may find I don't even know now you

844.369 --> 848.9490000000001
would just be literally walking in a

846.769 --> 852.589
perfectly geometrical straight line

848.949 --> 856.04
towards that North they might find that

852.589 --> 858.0490000000001
they just sadly keep on walking instead

856.04 --> 862.3689999999999
of going to the other side of the circle

858.049 --> 866.66
they go into another circle they walk

862.369 --> 869.5400000000001
out of the circle of the south of the

866.66 --> 872.99
another realm and

869.54 --> 875.54
yeah the loop widens again and there is

872.99 --> 879.65
a new equator there maybe even a yeah

875.54 --> 881.6899999999999
another Sun cycle there which also might

879.65 --> 884.81
have to do with the spatial looping

881.69 --> 888.7
factor it's an integral part of its

884.81 --> 891.77
design and again sound based remember I

888.7 --> 897.74
suggested that the heavenly bodies might

891.77 --> 901.04
be sound based well this does look kind

897.74 --> 908.57
of like a sound pattern within the

901.04 --> 912.53
rectangle yeah here goes my progression

908.57 --> 914.72
of this looping theory with the mystery

912.53 --> 917.93
of the heavenly bodies how it could be

914.72 --> 920.75
interconnected I guess it's kind of

917.93 --> 925.37
science fiction to most people but I

920.75 --> 929.26
hope this helps to conceptualize another

925.37 --> 934.27
possibility for an irregular looping

929.26 --> 934.27
rectangular flat earth world

955.0 --> 962.06
supreme arse god it's good you're

960.259 --> 963.62
included perspective in this model

962.06 --> 971.75
because the global doesn't the kind of

963.62 --> 977.93
perspective yep here for now infinite

971.75 --> 988.48
oscillation well yeah that does seem to

977.93 --> 988.4799999999999
be a potential part of it doesn't

992.72 --> 998.519
let me

994.63 --> 998.519
present it again

1015.34 --> 1028.8600000000001
we yeah so yeah now you can compare this

1024.79 --> 1036.04
earth if you would imagine thus

1028.86 --> 1040.1499999999999
shrinking the loop at the memo at the

1036.04 --> 1044.62
poles areas basically compacting it and

1040.15 --> 1049.0300000000002
then fitting that in here and as this is

1044.62 --> 1051.1
seen in perspective the yeah part of the

1049.03 --> 1055.51
background picture here the rectangular

1051.1 --> 1057.82
looping known realm that is the same

1055.51 --> 1062.11
perspective basic the basic overview

1057.82 --> 1067.77
look the designers overview look of what

1062.11 --> 1067.77
I yeah what i scrabbled together so

1069.64 --> 1079.5200000000002
it would be so cool if I could have like

1074.17 --> 1084.02
3d editor and make it look as gorgeous

1079.52 --> 1087.35
as what's Christmas le a made for me in

1084.02 --> 1089.83
this case yeah you can call him whatever

1087.35 --> 1095.57
you like traitor

1089.83 --> 1100.6399999999999
an agent a troll but man that guy really

1095.57 --> 1102.8
knew his CGI so and he helped me

1100.64 --> 1105.0500000000002
unconditionally and I thank him for that

1102.8 --> 1107.24
and I'm not going to throw this away

1105.05 --> 1110.6599999999999
just because he made it because it is

1107.24 --> 1118.63
amazing it is exactly what I what I

1110.66 --> 1118.63
wanted and did it out of generosity so

1119.779 --> 1132.049
never throw away a good deed so yeah

1128.389 --> 1134.619
Merry Christmas everyone Daniel field

1132.049 --> 1134.619
was

1140.039 --> 1147.019
I hope everyone is looking forward to

1143.489 --> 1150.83
their Christmas dinner if they have any

1147.019 --> 1150.83
are considering

1153.38 --> 1163.3400000000001
I don't know maybe considering trying to

1159.2 --> 1167.02
get to fix things up with family to have

1163.34 --> 1171.77
that as a priority and not necessarily

1167.02 --> 1174.35
for our caress your own personal agenda

1171.77 --> 1175.7
towards your family even though that

1174.35 --> 1178.27
would be a great opportunity and

1175.7 --> 1181.19
probably people that have these types of

1178.27 --> 1184.48
agendas within them that they want to

1181.19 --> 1188.81
like connect with their family with that

1184.48 --> 1190.85
they yeah many people will try that but

1188.81 --> 1196.52
it's better during Christmas to just

1190.85 --> 1199.49
purely focus on on the family bond and

1196.52 --> 1201.83
on the maintenance that it really does

1199.49 --> 1206.44
require more than it does with friends

1201.83 --> 1209.3
and it's harder it's much harder and

1206.44 --> 1213.3200000000002
that's yeah many people don't like it

1209.3 --> 1215.69
and some even to just completely throw

1213.32 --> 1218.45
that bond in the garbage can pretty

1215.69 --> 1221.69
fault some some people it is really

1218.45 --> 1226.04
painful but yeah there's nothing really

1221.69 --> 1228.1100000000001
you can do about it but try not to let

1226.04 --> 1230.96
it influence you and do the right thing

1228.11 --> 1237.86
yourself I set an example and hope that

1230.96 --> 1238.96
it will rub off and teach them a lesson

1237.86 --> 1244.1899999999998
by exam

1238.96 --> 1251.1200000000001
so yeah the Christmas spirits try not to

1244.19 --> 1256.509
focus so much on your own goals but the

1251.12 --> 1264.7399999999998
social bonds with people close to you

1256.509 --> 1268.6100000000001
and yeah also especially it's a good

1264.74 --> 1272.09
opportunity to try to fix things up you

1268.61 --> 1274.37
know if there's like a an annoying thing

1272.09 --> 1276.4089999999999
between you and another person that

1274.37 --> 1281.539
you're actually kind of close to and

1276.409 --> 1286.6100000000001
yeah you you could try to see if you can

1281.539 --> 1289.7
fix some of that because the funny thing

1286.61 --> 1293.629
about Christmas is it's more likely to

1289.7 --> 1297.1100000000001
work out and even if you do this and

1293.629 --> 1300.08
they reject it then it will rub off very

1297.11 --> 1302.9599999999998
positively towards you either way so it

1300.08 --> 1304.6999999999998
is sorry for being such a pragmatist or

1302.96 --> 1311.13
opportunist but it is a win-win

1304.7 --> 1317.8400000000001
situation either way so yeah

1311.13 --> 1321.419
very American of me but yeah do that

1317.84 --> 1325.23
it's important it's good it's good for

1321.419 --> 1327.8090000000002
you it's good for your family and it's

1325.23 --> 1330.72
an opportunity that should be taken it

1327.809 --> 1334.1299999999999
is also coincides with the concept of

1330.72 --> 1337.74
what is celestial wise going on this is

1334.13 --> 1343.919
the celebration of the returning of the

1337.74 --> 1346.14
light it is the the change the the light

1343.919 --> 1349.64
grows stronger again the Sun cycle

1346.14 --> 1356.669
becomes longer again and that

1349.64 --> 1362.7800000000002
symbolically rubs off on everyone so use

1356.669 --> 1366.89
that energy use to restore to heal to

1362.78 --> 1373.35
strengthen bonds with people that matter

1366.89 --> 1377.49
very important yeah and then you know

1373.35 --> 1380.9699999999998
all this crap about also a commercial

1377.49 --> 1386.25
holiday it's or it's pagan and even it's

1380.97 --> 1390.96
a devil and or all gods all the arrogant

1386.25 --> 1396.51
Christians or they are all crazy or dumb

1390.96 --> 1400.74
Lord this is not a time for bigotry it

1396.51 --> 1403.32
doesn't really matter what angle you

1400.74 --> 1405.539
have to Christmas it is about the moment

1403.32 --> 1408.289
it is about the energy it is about the

1405.539 --> 1408.289
opportunity

1410.53 --> 1419.98
use it don't sink into bigotry anytime

1416.35 --> 1422.2199999999998
it's the worst way you can waste this

1419.98 --> 1422.22
opportunity

1423.96 --> 1427.8500000000001
spread the good spirit

1435.57 --> 1443.899
right yeah Markov milk it is isn't it

1439.289 --> 1443.899
but the the funny thing about that is

1446.08 --> 1451.75
people don't believe certain things

1448.659 --> 1457.029
about you for a reason that is usually

1451.75 --> 1460.799
not personal even though they may

1457.029 --> 1466.899
suggest to you it is personal as a

1460.799 --> 1469.45
defensive measure because there they

1466.899 --> 1471.789
can't handle it and when they can't

1469.45 --> 1473.6490000000001
handle it it becomes ignored and

1471.789 --> 1476.169
ridiculed that is the default position

1473.649 --> 1477.82
for many people with the really hard

1476.169 --> 1478.2990000000002
subject there's nothing you can do about

1477.82 --> 1480.9399999999998
it

1478.299 --> 1483.8799999999999
all you can do is try to understand why

1480.94 --> 1488.73
they can't handle it and then try to

1483.88 --> 1492.8200000000002
work around it and see if you can

1488.73 --> 1495.789
strengthen the person with surrounding

1492.82 --> 1500.6689999999999
knowledge in order for them to be able

1495.789 --> 1503.139
to wield this at last you can basically

1500.669 --> 1506.019
subconsciously prepare them but it's

1503.139 --> 1509.799
difficult and it does require a lot of

1506.019 --> 1513.19
patience and effort and you have to see

1509.799 --> 1517.929
that they have this potential like some

1513.19 --> 1523.38
people just will never get it but others

1517.929 --> 1523.38
don't want to get it and look

1525.44 --> 1536.63
Christmas is not the time to do this

1529.04 --> 1541.75
it's not it's not about getting an

1536.63 --> 1541.75
understanding really it is about

1544.06 --> 1549.95
understanding that there is a bond

1546.59 --> 1556.99
despite the misunderstanding and also

1549.95 --> 1560.0800000000002
the trust in in human nature and in and

1556.99 --> 1564.68
in the path everyone takes in their own

1560.08 --> 1567.71
awakening or maybe not so awakening but

1564.68 --> 1571.6100000000001
every person basically chooses what they

1567.71 --> 1573.46
do and how they live and they may fool

1571.61 --> 1578.99
themselves that they do not choose it

1573.46 --> 1582.65
but they do so yeah you could maybe that

1578.99 --> 1585.32
is a good angle to start out with to get

1582.65 --> 1590.24
more psychological if you're up to that

1585.32 --> 1592.9299999999998
kind of thing but I don't know I I would

1590.24 --> 1596.69
not bring up Flat Earth out of nothing

1592.93 --> 1598.75
in a Christmas situation with people

1596.69 --> 1601.91
that I didn't know all too well

1598.75 --> 1604.37
like I would bring it up with my dad and

1601.91 --> 1607.0400000000002
my mom and my stepmom but because they

1604.37 --> 1610.2099999999998
know it but if I had other people over

1607.04 --> 1615.32
I'd be more careful about it unless

1610.21 --> 1617.9
through through another route it will be

1615.32 --> 1620.4199999999998
able to naturally come up like for

1617.9 --> 1625.3400000000001
example if Christianity becomes the

1620.42 --> 1627.44
subject and yeah there's dug in really

1625.34 --> 1631.27
wide maybe like alternative history

1627.44 --> 1631.27
subject will come up because of this

1636.2 --> 1641.179
yeah the the where it's political

1638.299 --> 1644.96
controlling machinations of the Catholic

1641.179 --> 1647.659
Church might come up but see there's so

1644.96 --> 1650.269
many angles like it all depends on if

1647.659 --> 1657.679
these people that you don't really know

1650.269 --> 1660.289
yet have a wide area of knowledge that

1657.679 --> 1664.759
they have touched upon if they know a

1660.289 --> 1666.769
lot if they're interested in in societal

1664.759 --> 1668.96
things and societal structures and

1666.769 --> 1673.009
things that are happening in trickery

1668.96 --> 1676.7
that it mostly depends on that if people

1673.009 --> 1679.009
have a innate interest in these subjects

1676.7 --> 1683.6290000000001
then we had things like Flat Earth will

1679.009 --> 1687.019
inevitably be on their path and they

1683.629 --> 1689.98
might still reject it but they will much

1687.019 --> 1695.239
be much more inclined to receive that

1689.98 --> 1698.019
without too much of a shock so that's

1695.239 --> 1698.019
how you test it

1704.55 --> 1712.94
all right

1707.1 --> 1712.9399999999998
look who's there it's vegan going

1713.779 --> 1720.179
alright yeah it would be nice to find

1716.49 --> 1722.69
that quote in the Bible vegan going if

1720.179 --> 1729.1100000000001
you can look that up I will be nice

1722.69 --> 1729.1100000000001
because I'm not too sure you did that

1732.82 --> 1738.81
alright Randy Newman thank you for that

1746.41 --> 1751.44
all right we're gonna talk about Christ

1748.69 --> 1751.44
history now

1774.39 --> 1777.23
hmm

1781.6 --> 1784.59
that's interesting

1787.54 --> 1792.52
Oh walls oh come on you should know

1791.47 --> 1794.91
better than that

1792.52 --> 1799.03
look in Christmas they supposedly

1794.91 --> 1802.9
celebrate his birthday but look actual

1799.03 --> 1806.53
Christian researchers have revealed that

1802.9 --> 1812.5600000000002
his birthday was not on Christmas not

1806.53 --> 1818.71
really I think it was somewhere earlier

1812.56 --> 1822.07
in December 12th December or something

1818.71 --> 1824.2
like that sorry if I got it wrong but it

1822.07 --> 1827.6699999999998
it wasn't during Christmas I think it

1824.2 --> 1831.46
was earlier somebody remind me about it

1827.67 --> 1837.3000000000002
but anyway yeah it's all been stuffed

1831.46 --> 1842.8600000000001
together into this multikill yeah

1837.3 --> 1846.1299999999999
multi-angle cultural celebration day but

1842.86 --> 1853.56
the actual birthday wasn't of Jesus was

1846.13 --> 1853.5600000000002
supposedly not during this this date so

1855.35 --> 1860.299
still good day to remember him though

1877.97 --> 1880.6290000000001
right

1886.52 --> 1893.59
yep but that can definitely be argued

1889.429 --> 1893.5900000000001
for that the Catholic Church basically

1893.74 --> 1902.1200000000001
tried to replace the pagan holidays by

1899.23 --> 1905.0
taking some elements from them and then

1902.12 --> 1910.309
integrating it into their Christian

1905.0 --> 1914.69
politicized religion system in the hopes

1910.309 --> 1917.51
that they could discourage the origins

1914.69 --> 1920.3600000000001
of it get people away from that and

1917.51 --> 1923.39
replacing it in that sense yeah it's

1920.36 --> 1925.37
clear-cut and they were open about it

1923.39 --> 1928.8200000000002
because yeah the Catholic Church was an

1925.37 --> 1931.4799999999998
enemy to the pagan religion and I guess

1928.82 --> 1937.48
this is a more diplomatic way or

1931.48 --> 1937.48
cultural appropriation way of doing it

1940.76 --> 1943.51
yeah

1943.52 --> 1946.09
yeah

1948.19 --> 1954.48
if you've seen the Pope's blessing I saw

1951.88 --> 1954.48
part of it

1957.32 --> 1966.82
but that guy is such a paucity Jesuit of

1962.299 --> 1966.82
course but this is just give me

1968.88 --> 1977.97
look anyone with the liquor sense with a

1973.83 --> 1981.1399999999999
normal spirit can look at the Pope right

1977.97 --> 1984.72
now and like especially during today and

1981.14 --> 1995.8100000000002
just see that that man is not a good man

1984.72 --> 1999.33
okay what he is resting on in him also

1995.81 --> 2006.35
contain fears and such that man is not a

1999.33 --> 2009.3799999999999
good man okay it's very obvious of

2006.35 --> 2014.57
course to many and the news and lab come

2009.38 --> 2018.65
on you can't be seriously believing that

2014.57 --> 2023.1699999999998
that man represents God the God of

2018.65 --> 2023.17
Christ can't seriously believe that

2024.44 --> 2029.38
arrey Protestants or something

2030.309 --> 2041.4189999999999
yeah but anyway in my personal religious

2033.589 --> 2044.809
opinion a religious group has no bearing

2041.419 --> 2049.099
whatsoever on the true path of Christ it

2044.809 --> 2053.27
is all about what you do how you

2049.099 --> 2056.889
interact with others and how you solve

2053.27 --> 2061.069
and deal with your own life's problems

2056.889 --> 2063.5
that is the critical part and that is

2061.069 --> 2065.899
also how you recognize those that walk

2063.5 --> 2071.119
the path and those that deviate from the

2065.899 --> 2076.3689999999997
path and those that willingly surrender

2071.119 --> 2078.23
to the to the dark spirits to the to the

2076.369 --> 2085.19
spirits of Lucifer in the spirits of

2078.23 --> 2090.19
Ahriman so yeah you recognize it by

2085.19 --> 2090.19
their actions and by their nature

2095.23 --> 2100.72
now it doesn't really matter what

2096.879 --> 2103.72
position you have what authority you

2100.72 --> 2106.14
have you either walked a path where you

2103.72 --> 2106.14
do not

2111.1 --> 2118.36
and sometimes you can walk a path that

2114.64 --> 2122.3799999999997
seems dark too many that may still have

2118.36 --> 2124.63
an important purpose to you but yeah if

2122.38 --> 2127.3
that is actually worth it will

2124.63 --> 2131.44
definitely be revealed to the individual

2127.3 --> 2140.05
the moment they are stopped that they

2131.44 --> 2142.75
are cut off from proceeding so yeah you

2140.05 --> 2146.92
can be fooled into following the path in

2142.75 --> 2149.47
a right way but the problem is you can

2146.92 --> 2151.87
only walk the path the way you see it

2149.47 --> 2154.89
that's the only way to do it and if you

2151.87 --> 2157.81
are fundamentally fooled if you are

2154.89 --> 2159.64
drifting without realizing it or without

2157.81 --> 2165.07
anyone pointing it out to you

2159.64 --> 2171.81
in a genuine heartfelt way then yeah you

2165.07 --> 2171.81
could get into all sorts of crazy

2172.7 --> 2178.3999999999996
crazy fanatic kind of actions I think

2175.64 --> 2184.93
look at the social justice warriors well

2178.4 --> 2189.069
there's a good example of what happens

2184.93 --> 2189.069
how far you can stray

2197.45 --> 2205.4199999999996
so the only real guidance suit should be

2202.63 --> 2210.819
yourself

2205.42 --> 2215.41
you your body and your spirit they are

2210.819 --> 2218.9
the community and they are the temple

2215.41 --> 2222.44
your spirit is the community your body

2218.9 --> 2225.04
is the temple or the church however you

2222.44 --> 2225.04
want to see it

2275.14 --> 2282.839
alright man you knew Neiman Jesus had to

2279.579 --> 2285.039
follow him right follow his example

2282.839 --> 2292.109
that's right that's what the path of

2285.039 --> 2292.1090000000004
Christ is see what he does and

2292.38 --> 2300.13
understand the spirit the energy the

2296.44 --> 2302.529
angle of why he does it and understand

2300.13 --> 2305.799
all of it understand the complete

2302.529 --> 2310.089
picture it's a very thing he does is a

2305.799 --> 2315.489
very rich multi-dimensional scenario

2310.089 --> 2318.0389999999998
like a painting of meaning that is being

2315.489 --> 2321.69
shown to those who can see it

2318.039 --> 2321.69
you can see that deep

2338.18 --> 2342.97
mark of MIL right well

2343.67 --> 2349.2200000000003
thus not the lightspawn always out of

2347.04 --> 2352.22
the darkness when the darkness becomes

2349.22 --> 2352.22
overpowering

2355.58 --> 2361.45
so yeah it's a it's a ying and yang in

2358.01 --> 2361.4500000000003
that sense it's the balance

2373.859 --> 2379.64
these F ikora I have no idea what you're

2377.219 --> 2379.64
talking about

2391.07 --> 2398.7400000000002
it's a lot of conspiracy Tartine going

2393.5 --> 2398.74
on look

2399.63 --> 2406.619
the Freemasonry and their religion and

2403.799 --> 2409.049
all of these archaic stories yeah they

2406.619 --> 2414.059
are completely and utterly interwoven

2409.049 --> 2417.42
with language cultural habits designs

2414.059 --> 2422.9590000000003
and everything names everything

2417.42 --> 2426.449
everywhere so oh my god something as a

2422.959 --> 2429.39
connection somewhere possible in some

2426.449 --> 2433.41
kind of Lucifer related thing whoo

2429.39 --> 2435.8089999999997
Wow that's really special yeah that

2433.41 --> 2437.759
that's a funny thing about like the

2435.809 --> 2441.029
devil persecution mindset you can

2437.759 --> 2445.999
literally literally find a devil in

2441.029 --> 2448.14
anything that is the problem about it

2445.999 --> 2451.41
and I think that's even pretty

2448.14 --> 2457.0389999999998
biblically clear that that is part of

2451.41 --> 2457.0389999999998
the human nature that we are

2457.8 --> 2464.55
that we have both good and evil within

2460.11 --> 2467.4900000000002
us and that it is the choice the the and

2464.55 --> 2469.4100000000003
the choice that is what is important so

2467.49 --> 2471.45
yeah you can find the devil in [ __ ]

2469.41 --> 2476.6099999999997
anything you know so really what you

2471.45 --> 2479.0699999999997
need to be doing it or Oh on the other

2476.61 --> 2481.6800000000003
hand there are people that really do

2479.07 --> 2485.19
have Devils in them and that do act out

2481.68 --> 2488.1299999999997
and are shameless about it and well I do

2485.19 --> 2492.84
like those people kind of do need a

2488.13 --> 2496.8
response because they're mad they're

2492.84 --> 2499.02
possessed but yeah

2496.8 --> 2501.5
- just persecute somebody because they

2499.02 --> 2506.19
have some kind of cultural or linguistic

2501.5 --> 2512.45
connection to some kind of thing oh my

2506.19 --> 2512.4500000000003
god you it'll never end seriously

2520.74 --> 2523.4599999999996
it's

2542.19 --> 2550.7400000000002
ah okay well I would talk about

2549.29 --> 2553.89
Christmas

2550.74 --> 2557.64
I guess warranted of course I don't want

2553.89 --> 2560.42
to get too much conspiracy nutty over it

2557.64 --> 2564.8399999999997
because that's very very very easy to do

2560.42 --> 2570.51
because yeah it is probably a Jesuit /

2564.84 --> 2575.0
Catholic creation originally and then

2570.51 --> 2578.25
latched onto by the robber barons that

2575.0 --> 2580.68
together again with the church or with

2578.25 --> 2585.9
the Jesuits decided to make this into

2580.68 --> 2588.5099999999998
like a commercial holiday thing and yeah

2585.9 --> 2591.69
let the companies do the marching

2588.51 --> 2595.5200000000004
basically do the conquering conquering

2591.69 --> 2595.52
through products conquering through

2597.05 --> 2606.0
through festivity articles and stuff and

2602.91 --> 2608.52
just oh my god in here in the

2606.0 --> 2610.83
Netherlands it's so typical like and

2608.52 --> 2616.02
whenever a holiday starts maybe it

2610.83 --> 2620.64
Easter or sinter Klass or Christmas like

2616.02 --> 2622.8
products food products also that are

2620.64 --> 2626.0099999999998
associated with these specific type of

2622.8 --> 2630.1800000000003
things they like and they get in store

2626.01 --> 2633.8100000000004
usually standard at least a month in

2630.18 --> 2638.8199999999997
advance sometimes even - and that is

2633.81 --> 2641.34
just such a sign on the wall like in the

2638.82 --> 2643.4100000000003
old days even 20 years ago like these

2641.34 --> 2645.57
type of products they would be they

2643.41 --> 2648.1499999999996
would start selling them maybe two two

2645.57 --> 2650.4900000000002
weeks in advance and it was the small

2648.15 --> 2653.19
time window where people would then do

2650.49 --> 2655.83
that but most people would typically

2653.19 --> 2660.3
recycle all our stuff that they didn't

2655.83 --> 2662.58
throw away and yet that worked well

2660.3 --> 2664.8
enough I guess but now like everything

2662.58 --> 2667.59
you can just buy off you can buy

2664.8 --> 2669.9300000000003
Christmas [ __ ] probably old all year

2667.59 --> 2670.48
long in some special Christmas store if

2669.93 --> 2674.6189999999997
you wanted

2670.48 --> 2677.4900000000002
no it's like it's crazy it's just all

2674.619 --> 2677.4900000000002
over the place now

2683.97 --> 2693.0299999999997
oh right okay well if Fe core is funding

2690.09 --> 2696.84
Riley in this project then good for them

2737.1 --> 2745.19
I go I'll revert back to the old format

3162.039 --> 3166.779
sorry I can't help you with the

3163.269 --> 3169.45
technicalities right that's not

3166.779 --> 3174.599
experience release I guess that nathan

3169.45 --> 3177.7599999999998
has the same problem because you want it

3174.599 --> 3180.2200000000003
are you trying to emulate his setup are

3177.76 --> 3184.21
you well we're pretty much exactly the

3180.22 --> 3187.2099999999996
same setup I'm just using I'm not losing

3184.21 --> 3189.579
using a slot a slideshow background yes

3187.21 --> 3191.619
although I might I might I've been

3189.579 --> 3196.4500000000003
thinking of like putting all my drawings

3191.619 --> 3198.94
and technical things in in like a

3196.45 --> 3201.1899999999996
background thingy but on the other hand

3198.94 --> 3205.63
yeah I'm used to basically showing my

3201.19 --> 3209.289
head on screen while I talk hey Eric you

3205.63 --> 3212.71
know someone else you have

3209.289 --> 3215.529
what's your testing I just doing uh

3212.71 --> 3222.059
doing my hangout to testing an open

3215.529 --> 3222.059
panel I threw it in the open Chet okay

3224.13 --> 3229.509
Merry Christmas

3225.789 --> 3231.9
whatever you will ty greetings pagan

3229.509 --> 3231.9
holiday

3232.63 --> 3242.19
I like the paganism paganism more than

3238.0 --> 3247.51
doing with nature I guess well it is

3242.19 --> 3250.7200000000003
yeah that and yeah then there is the

3247.51 --> 3253.8700000000003
approach what we are what are you gonna

3250.72 --> 3261.2799999999997
do with it do you think it works better

3253.87 --> 3264.22
in the northern hemisphere well that the

3261.28 --> 3266.7400000000002
timing off the holiday to coincide with

3264.22 --> 3277.1499999999996
the nature that sort of thing you know

3266.74 --> 3279.37
what I mean southern hemisphere it is

3277.15 --> 3281.67
basically the same but exactly the

3279.37 --> 3283.87
opposite

3281.67 --> 3285.9700000000003
how can you say it's the same but

3283.87 --> 3291.42
opposite that's not the signs are

3285.97 --> 3294.1299999999997
opposite so it's based on the seasons

3291.42 --> 3297.4900000000002
that's what we got a few

3294.13 --> 3304.03
we got a few days of plus 35 degrees

3297.49 --> 3306.1
coming up in northern life Celsius right

3304.03 --> 3310.9
but what I'm saying basically is that

3306.1 --> 3314.08
the pagan classic pagan festivities the

3310.9 --> 3317.2000000000003
moments in the year should in the

3314.08 --> 3320.46
southern hemisphere in south of the

3317.2 --> 3323.23
Equator should be the exact opposite and

3320.46 --> 3325.27
also there is the issues yeah with the

3323.23 --> 3329.35
equator because it doesn't work the same

3325.27 --> 3332.56
way there it doesn't really apply that's

3329.35 --> 3337.36
not the cycles of how it works at the

3332.56 --> 3338.92
equator so that's different but all

3337.36 --> 3341.4
these holidays especially traditional

3338.92 --> 3344.98
ones whether you're talking about

3341.4 --> 3347.35
tradition of white European pagan and or

3344.98 --> 3353.79
Christian whatever and you know the

3347.35 --> 3357.88
Chinese New Year it is based in

3353.79 --> 3360.91
agriculture Sun you know the growing

3357.88 --> 3365.11
season the days starting to get longer

3360.91 --> 3366.06
again and yeah so yeah make sense so

3365.11 --> 3369.42
yeah I mean

3366.06 --> 3372.5099999999998
is just its flipped if you're living in

3369.42 --> 3377.4900000000002
Australia or South America no these um

3372.51 --> 3378.8100000000004
these holidays which we talk about not

3377.49 --> 3382.35
just European ones but again like

3378.81 --> 3390.5099999999998
Chinese New Year it's more northern

3382.35 --> 3392.31
based cultures well yeah that's yeah

3390.51 --> 3396.3900000000003
that's the where the culture of the West

3392.31 --> 3397.92
pretty much started so yeah well I mean

3396.39 --> 3400.56
also China Japan you know I mean it's

3397.92 --> 3402.7200000000003
just north and I don't know if you

3400.56 --> 3406.89
noticed but China is also north of the

3402.72 --> 3410.1
Equator so for example I don't know

3406.89 --> 3411.72
about you guys but he was you might know

3410.1 --> 3416.88
but I'm totally ignorant of any

3411.72 --> 3420.87
traditional native Australian holidays

3416.88 --> 3424.08
or ceremony isn't totally unfamiliar

3420.87 --> 3426.21
with any okay you're talking about in

3424.08 --> 3434.7599999999998
indigenous ones yeah

3426.21 --> 3437.61
indigenous based holidays no not really

3434.76 --> 3439.67
not gonna start well as you know the

3437.61 --> 3441.81
aboriginals are indigenous to Australia

3439.67 --> 3443.34
right but there were lots of different

3441.81 --> 3446.2999999999997
there were lots and lots of different

3443.34 --> 3456.6000000000004
tribes so they probably weren't as a

3446.3 --> 3459.3900000000003
cohesive right with the cultures like

3456.6 --> 3463.98
person to person storytelling tradition

3459.39 --> 3465.99
based like typical tribal hmm so we're a

3463.98 --> 3468.2400000000002
very individual would give their own

3465.99 --> 3472.7999999999997
little spin to it that's how it always

3468.24 --> 3474.41
works in tribal says set up so yeah so

3472.8 --> 3478.25
you never know what the truth really was

3474.41 --> 3483.8999999999996
indeed I mean like I don't know also

3478.25 --> 3488.25
traditional as my in these holidays any

3483.9 --> 3489.9900000000002
of the native North American so you know

3488.25 --> 3495.18
but most of us are familiar with

3489.99 --> 3499.41
Christmas and Hanukkah and Muslim thing

3495.18 --> 3501.66
and Chinese New Year Tet

3499.41 --> 3506.06
from North American traditional North

3501.66 --> 3509.45
American was basically an animist

3506.06 --> 3513.119
culture very directed either towards

3509.45 --> 3516.5699999999997
nature or in the raw elements or towards

3513.119 --> 3519.96
animals and animal spirits and their

3516.57 --> 3523.8
traditions and ancestors of course there

3519.96 --> 3527.31
are those and that's what the festival's

3523.8 --> 3530.9700000000003
in which were also by the way seasonal

3527.31 --> 3533.369
based that's what they were based on so

3530.97 --> 3536.3689999999997
they were also seasonal based but yeah

3533.369 --> 3540.57
pagan from a perspective look naked you

3536.369 --> 3543.06
conclude with the information we have in

3540.57 --> 3544.8900000000003
today's world that the whatever you want

3543.06 --> 3546.119
to call it the First Nations or whatever

3544.89 --> 3548.46
the true I don't know let's just say

3546.119 --> 3553.77
that the native cultures the original

3548.46 --> 3556.65
cultures didn't really have group Group

3553.77 --> 3561.72
group think group behavior holidays like

3556.65 --> 3564.42
we have now is it to me to me those

3561.72 --> 3567.06
cultures lived more in the moment in the

3564.42 --> 3574.89
day you know in the day by day they

3567.06 --> 3578.19
weren't so calendar base just asking no

3574.89 --> 3580.98
no no they were celestial calendar base

3578.19 --> 3586.5
come on the calendar they would have the

3580.98 --> 3589.56
calendar system of some sort

3586.5 --> 3591.15
no they would at a time time measurement

3589.56 --> 3593.22
system of some sort to celebrate

3591.15 --> 3598.23
particular things at particular times

3593.22 --> 3601.3489999999997
right yeah like the calendar the written

3598.23 --> 3603.869
calendar is a bureaucratic invention the

3601.349 --> 3608.28
celestial calendar has always been the

3603.869 --> 3610.589
calendar for any people no matter how

3608.28 --> 3614.03
primitive because it is so consistent

3610.589 --> 3614.0299999999997
and it's not that hard to figure out

3617.18 --> 3623.85
so of course they're gonna tune it to

3619.68 --> 3626.52
the cycles of the the Sun and the Sun

3623.85 --> 3628.7999999999997
the receding and special star phenomena

3626.52 --> 3631.22
that constantly appear at these specific

3628.8 --> 3636.6600000000003
times every time and all that yeah

3631.22 --> 3638.9399999999996
that's kinda like registries of this so

3636.66 --> 3641.64
I guess if your culture is more let's

3638.94 --> 3645.3
say nomadic based I just had it in

3641.64 --> 3647.52
Australia North America mm-hmm you're

3645.3 --> 3650.1600000000003
probably less prone to have like you

3647.52 --> 3652.98
said a bureaucratic date structure it's

3650.16 --> 3654.66
more seasonal and being you know so what

3652.98 --> 3658.59
it starts getting cold you move it

3654.66 --> 3661.7999999999997
further so yeah so it's not really about

3658.59 --> 3667.6200000000003
dates arbitrary dates a calendar it's

3661.8 --> 3670.8300000000004
more geographical

3667.62 --> 3674.37
seasonal geographic knowledge yes like

3670.83 --> 3675.27
knowing during the like every time of

3674.37 --> 3677.88
the year

3675.27 --> 3681.0
what is a certain region like and then

3677.88 --> 3684.27
planning out on the the best place to be

3681.0 --> 3687.18
during every season basically right yeah

3684.27 --> 3695.91
that's what nomads do and they're very

3687.18 --> 3700.0499999999997
good at it yeah I've always been liking

3695.91 --> 3702.39
for that concept wish we could live that

3700.05 --> 3707.4300000000003
way well it's a little bit more

3702.39 --> 3711.0
interesting than what we have well it's

3707.43 --> 3716.12
it's just different but yeah it can be

3711.0 --> 3720.45
very very gratifying but also isolated

3716.12 --> 3723.66
but yeah look for humans walking this

3720.45 --> 3726.0899999999997
therapeutical so these people will never

3723.66 --> 3729.0899999999997
be stressed out of their mind and acting

3726.09 --> 3731.8500000000004
out like little children ever because

3729.09 --> 3734.07
they are walking all of their life so

3731.85 --> 3737.0299999999997
they had plenty of time to think and to

3734.07 --> 3737.03
settle down and

3737.259 --> 3740.259
right

3741.07 --> 3747.46
yeah well people that just live behind a

3744.7 --> 3750.5499999999997
desk they start to live in their own

3747.46 --> 3752.41
little worlds because they can't move

3750.55 --> 3754.69
around in the real world or they're

3752.41 --> 3756.52
afraid to they're stuck so then they

3754.69 --> 3759.37
create their own little world in their

3756.52 --> 3761.68
head that they can explore and well-lit

3759.37 --> 3763.5099999999998
woodwork around but they also have

3761.68 --> 3766.5699999999997
become delusional because they are in

3763.51 --> 3769.3900000000003
full control of this world and that's

3766.57 --> 3770.86
pretty pretty routine which which is

3769.39 --> 3773.2
comforting you know I like my routine

3770.86 --> 3775.51
but I also like you know I also like

3773.2 --> 3777.52
traveling and getting quote lost you

3775.51 --> 3780.2200000000003
know just like because wandering it's

3777.52 --> 3784.24
but routine you know now we have people

3780.22 --> 3785.56
you live in city X and you got your you

3784.24 --> 3787.81
know your morning routine when you

3785.56 --> 3790.63
commute to your cubicle you got your

3787.81 --> 3793.7799999999997
coffee spot got your general couple

3790.63 --> 3800.08
lunch spots and ya got your local

3793.78 --> 3805.2400000000002
Walmart or whatever it is quite quite

3800.08 --> 3813.0699999999997
the contrast of the nomadic mindset I

3805.24 --> 3817.2999999999997
guess absolutely that convenience is a

3813.07 --> 3822.94
cultural obsession in the West speed and

3817.3 --> 3827.05
convenience but it is also yeah it is

3822.94 --> 3830.8
what basically drove Western society to

3827.05 --> 3832.7200000000003
function relatively good development but

3830.8 --> 3837.4900000000002
then the problem came the cultural

3832.72 --> 3840.6099999999997
backlash and that's never been solved

3837.49 --> 3844.93
really it's only aggravated so the more

3840.61 --> 3849.34
convenience and speed a person has

3844.93 --> 3852.46
available to them the more pressure they

3849.34 --> 3855.84
become providing having too much time on

3852.46 --> 3863.02
their hands and becoming delusional and

3855.84 --> 3866.61
yeah that's what happens again the the

3863.02 --> 3866.61
the luxury disease

3867.64 --> 3875.089
and instead of having not enough time to

3872.329 --> 3878.3
get everything you want you get

3875.089 --> 3880.4
everything you want but yeah you have

3878.3 --> 3888.559
too much time on your hands and you

3880.4 --> 3894.53
become burdened by it and you become

3888.559 --> 3897.38
bored and you start to corrupt out of

3894.53 --> 3902.15
sheer freakin boredom because you want

3897.38 --> 3908.4500000000003
something new that's what happens to a

3902.15 --> 3910.46
lot of people it's crazy yeah a lot of

3908.45 --> 3922.52
people go this is the [ __ ] out of pure

3910.46 --> 3924.4700000000003
boredom anyway yeah I don't think Nathan

4360.67 --> 4376.79
we let me think it was 909 in the new

4366.92 --> 4380.0
year oh nine to ten so under yeah that's

4376.79 --> 4383.03
when that's when the drought I think was

4380.0 --> 4385.7
breaking around then we had to walk just

4383.03 --> 4389.0599999999995
after I left a few days that fire broke

4385.7 --> 4392.48
out in New South Wales that big big

4389.06 --> 4395.650000000001
wildfire through the rock yeah we've had

4392.48 --> 4397.549999999999
a few of those it's not that they do

4395.65 --> 4399.679999999999
2010 teach you which one you're talking

4397.55 --> 4402.38

4399.68 --> 4404.12
few of them few big ones were you in New

4402.38 --> 4421.93
South Wales were you in Sydney or

4404.12 --> 4425.57
something we which city did you prefer I

4421.93 --> 4431.990000000001
think Melbourne was a bit more bohemian

4425.57 --> 4437.42
a bit more just cooler yeah we are are

4431.99 --> 4440.99
you enough Melbourne Sydney was I mean

4437.42 --> 4445.54
one of the most beautiful cities really

4440.99 --> 4447.65
nice it is pretty it's pretty to look at

4445.54 --> 4453.07
especially at night when all the lights

4447.65 --> 4455.0599999999995
are on mmm-hmm but no burns not bad

4453.07 --> 4456.98
Melbourne is pretty cool I stayed uh

4455.06 --> 4458.34
when I was in Sydney I was on the North

4456.98 --> 4460.29
Shore

4458.34 --> 4462.96
and then I was in Melbourne and I was a

4460.29 --> 4464.84
st. kilda mostly all the same mostly in

4462.96 --> 4466.949
the beach they're not really the city

4464.84 --> 4469.159000000001

Melbourne yeah okay

4570.48 --> 4580.53
oh and do you realize it's Tom loses his

4576.179 --> 4584.84
birthday what's the little devil he

4580.53 --> 4587.32
moves his congratulations

4584.84 --> 4594.1900000000005
it's a lot of people's birthdays today

4587.32 --> 4594.19
no to Moose is like a really famous guy

4595.24 --> 4601.099999999999
scripture well demonic scripture but

4598.73 --> 4603.5599999999995
according to knowledge scream Jets

4601.1 --> 4607.400000000001
yeah but according to what sayings plea

4603.56 --> 4608.96
and here's the joke the Satanists have

4607.4 --> 4614.23
been hiding the truth

4608.96 --> 4618.41
oh wow really not not that they're a

4614.23 --> 4622.45
religion is right not that I'm saying

4618.41 --> 4627.41
this but they've been hiding the truth

4622.45 --> 4631.88
so everybody will join a satanic cult

4627.41 --> 4633.55
because they don't know yeah that's what

4631.88 --> 4641.18
was this guy's name that's their

4633.55 --> 4645.47
methodology but to move to news yeah and

4641.18 --> 4651.530000000001
what's which is he from if you just

4645.47 --> 4658.64
google not you know you'll find a lot

4651.53 --> 4664.45
but basically from what I understand the

4658.64 --> 4667.4800000000005
Meuse came from a satanic bloodline

4664.45 --> 4669.82
somebody thought he was the devil

4667.48 --> 4677.78
reincarnated

4669.82 --> 4679.969999999999
so I can't understand is this is this

4677.78 --> 4681.65
out of the standard Bible or is it from

4679.97 --> 4685.88
some other scripture from some other

4681.65 --> 4688.12
religion when you see the standard Bible

4685.88 --> 4692.150000000001
are you talking Christian

4688.12 --> 4699.28
yeah supposed okay okay no no it's not

4692.15 --> 4702.2
there it's wrote the story originally

4699.28 --> 4708.82
you gotta remember there were scribes

4702.2 --> 4708.82
and historians oh right yeah

4709.75 --> 4717.2
originally they decided to take on a

4713.41 --> 4718.55
holiday which was around to mooses

4717.2 --> 4720.71
birthday

4718.55 --> 4721.7300000000005
yeah that's very nice who wrote it that

4720.71 --> 4728.11
was the question

4721.73 --> 4731.598999999999
oh who wrote it [ __ ] I I've seen it and

4728.11 --> 4733.73
several places on YouTube yeah that's

4731.599 --> 4736.6900000000005
really nice you know I've also seen a

4733.73 --> 4740.119
lot of things on YouTube about how

4736.69 --> 4742.098999999999
aliens created humankind from another

4740.119 --> 4745.13
planet and everything that's very nice

4742.099 --> 4748.01
but who actually wrote it if it's this

4745.13 --> 4750.92
is a religion who started it you know I

4748.01 --> 4753.829000000001
know I know [ __ ] I know stuff that was

4750.92 --> 4755.119
written by like Anton LaVey and people

4753.829 --> 4758.179
like that I know they were out there

4755.119 --> 4759.949
writing that declaring these books and

4758.179 --> 4763.219
people with him seriously

4759.949 --> 4768.379999999999
apparently so who wrote this but or is

4763.219 --> 4770.27
this just some stupid maybe if he

4768.38 --> 4772.099
doesn't know if he doesn't know who

4770.27 --> 4774.1990000000005
wrote if maybe he can give us an idea

4772.099 --> 4778.34
when it started at least when it was

4774.199 --> 4783.919999999999
written it was according to Satanists it

4778.34 --> 4791.42
was written like a courtly ad for sorry

4783.92 --> 4792.5
BC I get those two confused and I'm

4791.42 --> 4798.4400000000005
trying to think

4792.5 --> 4805.54
I mean Tammuz he was before with you

4798.44 --> 4810.32
guys called Jesus Christ so I don't know

4805.54 --> 4817.489
but but have you notice every single

4810.32 --> 4822.139
religion as a big thing around the exact

4817.489 --> 4824.9
same time so something something

4822.139 --> 4829.0
happened right so what is that what did

4824.9 --> 4829.0
I miss that now I'm doing this one sorry

4830.679 --> 4847.429
so around December 25th okay right okay

4841.099 --> 4851.09
so what but you also have to go along

4847.429 --> 4854.27
the lines that Satanists have been

4851.09 --> 4855.26
try to inject their policy into

4854.27 --> 4858.77
everything

4855.26 --> 4864.530000000001
oh you mean like every other group out

4858.77 --> 4872.9490000000005
there ever there you go everybody yeah

4864.53 --> 4878.09
everybody does it so unique that is so

4872.949 --> 4881.199
inject their ideas into society that's I

4878.09 --> 4885.289
would have never thought about that

4881.199 --> 4888.678999999999
can I ask just a quick side question do

4885.289 --> 4893.03
you go do you go by the another name

4888.679 --> 4894.17
flatly with Alaska watch and no you

4893.03 --> 4900.38
don't know

4894.17 --> 4905.869
GZ sound familiar party boy that's right

4900.38 --> 4911.329
yes yes okay Oh on this chord yeah they

4905.869 --> 4922.369
got me does anybody know how to turn off

4911.329 --> 4924.558999999999
my my my microphone oh you have mute you

4922.369 --> 4926.69
have to know sir there's a button on

4924.559 --> 4932.570000000001
your screen and it says to Moo's you

4926.69 --> 4936.469
press that little moose but yeah just

4932.57 --> 4941.179
just hit the Tamizh button you give it a

4936.469 --> 4947.3
good hard whack give yeah he whacks back

4941.179 --> 4953.719
a lot a lot of people don't want to

4947.3 --> 4958.1900000000005
believe there will exist I think that

4953.719 --> 4962.42
helps with good and evil exists

4958.19 --> 4963.23
everywhere do you want to blame it on

4962.42 --> 4970.76
something else

4963.23 --> 4973.879999999999
you can't both there goes hey slow down

4970.76 --> 4980.21
slow down what you guys should change

4973.88 --> 4983.58
it's not say god sake creators because

4980.21 --> 4988.92
one there's more than one deity

4983.58 --> 4991.17
created human beings and what Satanists

4988.92 --> 4993.3
have been trying to do is really weird

4991.17 --> 4998.01
everything where are you getting that

4993.3 --> 5002.42
wood part more deities creating humans

4998.01 --> 5008.4400000000005
that's Oh Yahweh have you noticed there

5002.42 --> 5011.21
are no vowels it's just simply initials

5008.44 --> 5017.36
have you ever thought of the fact that

5011.21 --> 5023.66
it's just the initials you know various

5017.36 --> 5029.42
deities that matter well there's more

5023.66 --> 5034.16
than one letter in Yahweh so so they're

5029.42 --> 5036.86
all initials yeah so maybe the

5034.16 --> 5039.95
apparition of the cloud was an

5036.86 --> 5042.71
amalgamation of something that can be

5039.95 --> 5045.65
have separate entities as a

5042.71 --> 5049.58
manifestation in mind they're in my

5045.65 --> 5053.889999999999
theory the deities or the Elohim are

5049.58 --> 5058.78
physical manifestations like branches of

5053.89 --> 5062.33
the source of the Creator which cannot

5058.78 --> 5066.13
completely and be part of the creation

5062.33 --> 5069.05
separately so the Elohim are the

5066.13 --> 5075.47
separate branches they are also kind of

5069.05 --> 5078.62
depends on it's different parts of the

5075.47 --> 5082.6900000000005
same light spectrum that's how I kind of

5078.62 --> 5090.5599999999995
see it in energy frequency purpose wise

5082.69 --> 5100.9
so I'm not arguing what I wanted or I

5090.56 --> 5100.900000000001
think my views different angle is that

5101.05 --> 5109.75
that here's how I see everything

5104.33 --> 5109.75
happened originally oh yeah

5110.35 --> 5116.27
originally I feeI figured somebody

5113.51 --> 5116.93
created this green house that we call

5116.27 --> 5121.67
earth

5116.93 --> 5128.35
they strip mined most of it left us

5121.67 --> 5133.79
whatever we have now basically

5128.35 --> 5138.56
afterwards I figure there was once you

5133.79 --> 5141.71
strip mine whatever was here by whatever

5138.56 --> 5144.860000000001
created this greenhouse they drop off

5141.71 --> 5149.78
human beings which are simply there to

5144.86 --> 5152.54
grow a soul and apparently this happens

5149.78 --> 5158.63
over and over again and this is the

5152.54 --> 5163.97
greenhouse that we live in then for

5158.63 --> 5167.66
whatever reason as far as us living here

5163.97 --> 5170.6
because once you grow a soul that end of

5167.66 --> 5172.97
it gets taken care of and it goes to one

5170.6 --> 5177.2300000000005
of two sides I mean there's everybody

5172.97 --> 5181.04
heard about heaven and hell just the

5177.23 --> 5186.73
meanings can get convoluted regardless

5181.04 --> 5189.74
of that I figure something happened

5186.73 --> 5192.53
around what we perceived to be a few

5189.74 --> 5196.28
hundred years ago that has seriously

5192.53 --> 5199.61
changed the way things have been going

5196.28 --> 5203.3
on because a new telling are when the

5199.61 --> 5207.549999999999
mud flood you guys call it a mud flood

5203.3 --> 5210.62
yeah that's what actually left traceable

5207.55 --> 5214.42
remnants that's well actually start to

5210.62 --> 5217.67
prove I can see that yeah you can see

5214.42 --> 5220.46
something got very a boat how would you

5217.67 --> 5222.92
look at the fact that something but also

5220.46 --> 5225.2
the societal changes that it would bring

5222.92 --> 5228.68
with it and how people would be more

5225.2 --> 5231.679999999999
inclined to surrender to individuals

5228.68 --> 5233.72
that actually have a solid new plan for

5231.68 --> 5237.530000000001
rebuilding it and potentially trying out

5233.72 --> 5239.900000000001
new things which in a normal functioning

5237.53 --> 5242.87
world without everything being buried in

5239.9 --> 5244.58
mud what people would not be inclined to

5242.87 --> 5247.4
do that because they'd like to keep

5244.58 --> 5248.239
things the same so that's what I think

5247.4 --> 5253.67
happened and

5248.239 --> 5256.429999999999
and why no I think we lost the war

5253.67 --> 5260.9890000000005
because for some reason

5256.43 --> 5264.02
well look at the Sheep I can't hear you

5260.989 --> 5267.32
for some reason I'm not talking okay I

5264.02 --> 5269.450000000001
heard your lips or saya but what I would

5267.32 --> 5272.929999999999
say what I was thinking is here's what

5269.45 --> 5276.11
I'm thinking okay here are your clues we

5272.93 --> 5279.17
had working toilets way back in Roman

5276.11 --> 5281.839999999999
times okay we knew how to make

5279.17 --> 5285.26
pressurise or how to pressurize water

5281.84 --> 5288.110000000001
because we had work we had our fount we

5285.26 --> 5290.18
had all the castles fountains working on

5288.11 --> 5293.57
pressurized water be with me so far

5290.18 --> 5297.469
yeah okay not a drop is going into the

5293.57 --> 5301.61
castle so clearly they're using urine

5297.469 --> 5304.79
and and and and what we call feces for

5301.61 --> 5306.71
something else because there's clearly a

5304.79 --> 5309.1
use for it since they don't want to get

5306.71 --> 5313.7
rid of it okay

5309.1 --> 5315.5
okay I mean here all the castles have

5313.7 --> 5321.5
the following things in common they all

5315.5 --> 5324.26
have organs pipe organs working off

5321.5 --> 5326.62
which which another thing they didn't

5324.26 --> 5330.56
want you to read from Tesla's findings

5326.62 --> 5336.739
and on top of that no and on top of that

5330.56 --> 5338.18
okay and they all have antennas what I'm

5336.739 --> 5339.65
saying is that we were running on

5338.18 --> 5342.950000000001
different kind of energy

5339.65 --> 5344.96
Yoshi somebody okay we know that I know

5342.95 --> 5347.2699999999995
that that's what was destroyed in the

5344.96 --> 5349.31
mud flood we're very well aware that

5347.27 --> 5351.4400000000005
there was a high electrical Society

5349.31 --> 5353.830000000001
happening it was integrated in

5351.44 --> 5357.349999999999
architecture and in Applied Technology

5353.83 --> 5361.25
distance messaging using why did we get

5357.35 --> 5364.54
rid of it we didn't get realistic it was

5361.25 --> 5368.18
chaos electricity manipulated

5364.54 --> 5372.83
manipulated the electricity no it was

5368.18 --> 5375.2300000000005
gotten rid of cuz yeah why because they

5372.83 --> 5378.92
needed artificial scarcity in order to

5375.23 --> 5381.659
create a market to keep control we had

5378.92 --> 5386.9400000000005
things going just fine right up yeah

5381.659 --> 5390.659
that's why we had that's why okay so

5386.94 --> 5393.659
there was a war you don't just change

5390.659 --> 5395.94
from one thing that was working to

5393.659 --> 5400.638999999999
something else which we claim to be

5395.94 --> 5404.339999999999
working now for us which yes somebody

5400.639 --> 5407.58
somebody activated the fishies somebody

5404.34 --> 5411.71
caused a cataclysm probably happened out

5407.58 --> 5413.94
of nowhere all right someone mix the mud

5411.71 --> 5418.44
someone mixed there you go someone

5413.94 --> 5421.29
someone made things clear as mud but if

5418.44 --> 5423.629999999999
you look if you look at here's where we

5421.29 --> 5425.61
decide to turn the wall we decide to

5423.63 --> 5428.33
turn the earth into a pretty ball that

5425.61 --> 5432.78
we all can't stand as flat earthers

5428.33 --> 5434.969
here's where Tesla I mean look at look

5432.78 --> 5438.21
look at look at what you would do if

5434.969 --> 5440.28
someone decided if someone was basically

5438.21 --> 5443.159
tapping into all the stuff that we were

5440.28 --> 5448.0199999999995
playing with before would you guys call

5443.159 --> 5450.69
mud floods they just decided to isolate

5448.02 --> 5453.06
him in a hotel room that's where he

5450.69 --> 5455.58
lived his entire life and then the

5453.06 --> 5458.639
moment the boy died everything became

5455.58 --> 5460.5
private everything he ever worked on

5458.639 --> 5464.389
became private and here's a guy who

5460.5 --> 5467.52
wanted to make a car that ran on nothing

5464.389 --> 5469.53
well free energy we call it free energy

5467.52 --> 5472.59
now right but he had a car he already

5469.53 --> 5474.54
existed sorry he wasn't and I don't

5472.59 --> 5476.85
think he really was an inventor he was

5474.54 --> 5479.04
just a master of it I think that Tesla

5476.85 --> 5482.900000000001
probably had discovered much more

5479.04 --> 5486.6
complex stuff to do with electricity

5482.9 --> 5488.339999999999
that's much more heavy than just

5486.6 --> 5492.29
electrical cords because there are

5488.34 --> 5495.87
freaking photographs of electrical cars

5492.29 --> 5496.949
okay so the Tesla actually exists

5495.87 --> 5501.32
because I've heard that he was a

5496.949 --> 5505.259999999999
fabrication now I think Tesla exists

5501.32 --> 5508.17
existed but he's been used as a cover

5505.26 --> 5509.909000000001
story as a wizard who invented all of

5508.17 --> 5512.1900000000005
this and that didn't get the chance to

5509.909 --> 5515.37
cover for that it was absolutely

5512.19 --> 5519.96
worldwide integrated in society

5515.37 --> 5521.64
and it was a destroyed removed so do you

5519.96 --> 5528.45
think he's falling in love with the

5521.64 --> 5530.43
pigeon was fabricated well he fell in

5528.45 --> 5532.47
love with a pigeon he wanted to marry a

5530.43 --> 5535.820000000001
pigeon he wrote love letters to a pigeon

5532.47 --> 5541.68
he said I was fabricated probably I

5535.82 --> 5543.78
think this cute I think this cute made

5541.68 --> 5546.27
him look crazy the first thing you want

5543.78 --> 5549.599999999999
to do is make a person look crazy

5546.27 --> 5552.75
because then no one will listen to step

5549.6 --> 5555.570000000001
one and you think that the boy was crazy

5552.75 --> 5558.71
yet we can attribute the fact that he

5555.57 --> 5562.62
wanted to give the world free energy and

5558.71 --> 5564.78
he will stop that by simply financial

5562.62 --> 5567.71
funding all and at the moment they said

5564.78 --> 5571.74
we can't put a meter on his car

5567.71 --> 5574.89
therefore it's a bad idea but but here's

5571.74 --> 5578.76
a guy rockefeller who came up with an

5574.89 --> 5581.13
ingenious idea how to take a reusable

5578.76 --> 5584.51
fuel that keeps coming out of the ground

5581.13 --> 5587.7
and say no no no it's a fossil fuel

5584.51 --> 5590.37
therefore it will run out one day yeah

5587.7 --> 5595.32
it will never run out official scarcity

5590.37 --> 5598.14
that's what was the creation of the

5595.32 --> 5600.87
artificial scarcity mindset where

5598.14 --> 5607.070000000001
everything runs out its limit

5600.87 --> 5608.7
that's the that's the say the

5607.07 --> 5614.28
marketization

5608.7 --> 5617.179999999999
of the Western culture they turned it

5614.28 --> 5617.179999999999
all into markets

5619.59 --> 5622.7300000000005
seems he's gone

5624.28 --> 5628.87
so guys yeah if you want to say

5627.43 --> 5630.76
something I think I'm gonna round out to

5628.87 --> 5633.25
show I've been going for a 1/2 hour now

5630.76 --> 5635.77
and yeah Eric you're me I was gonna ask

5633.25 --> 5638.68
was I was going to ask you about the mud

5635.77 --> 5639.88
plug floods cuz I've only heard a little

5638.68 --> 5641.740000000001
bit about them I don't know what they

5639.88 --> 5648.64
were but maybe we can pick that up

5641.74 --> 5653.469999999999
another time well what is it what is it

5648.64 --> 5661.59
it's an event that happened in the in

5653.47 --> 5664.45
the 18th century so what was the event

5661.59 --> 5667.51
we're not a hundred percent sure we call

5664.45 --> 5671.13
it a mud flood but what seems to have

5667.51 --> 5676.06
happened is that suddenly a giant

5671.13 --> 5679.35
mudslide covered up most land in the

5676.06 --> 5684.7300000000005
world or a large large chunk of it

5679.35 --> 5689.14
burying stuff in from one meter up to a

5684.73 --> 5693.3099999999995
hundred or more meters of mud in some

5689.14 --> 5695.530000000001
case varying entire cities completely

5693.31 --> 5696.160000000001
vanishing in the mud and how that

5695.53 --> 5699.04
happened

5696.16 --> 5701.139999999999
it came from somewhere definitely so

5699.04 --> 5707.2
might have been piled up on a giant

5701.14 --> 5709.54
mountain it may have been costs not that

5707.2 --> 5714.34
it wasn't actually a slide that but that

5709.54 --> 5717.64
of that the mud well faraway finish know

5714.34 --> 5720.01
that the mother basically instantly

5717.64 --> 5722.5
created through vibration through the

5720.01 --> 5727.12
fascist technology which caused

5722.5 --> 5729.73
everything to sink in the land as if

5727.12 --> 5733.599999999999
everything became quicksand for a moment

5729.73 --> 5736.54
that is an alternative option to what

5733.6 --> 5741.42
could have happened okay so how far and

5736.54 --> 5741.42
wide is is there signs of this mud flood

5741.69 --> 5744.69
it's

5745.33 --> 5752.96
at least the entire northern hemisphere

5748.84 --> 5765.89
the north of the Equator

5752.96 --> 5768.11
there's regions but yeah I think there's

5765.89 --> 5772.64
signs of it all over the world in

5768.11 --> 5777.58
America in all of Europe Russia I think

5772.64 --> 5781.31
even in China so Southeast Asia

5777.58 --> 5783.65
it would be highly unlikely that the mud

5781.31 --> 5786.2300000000005
came from one particular source it would

5783.65 --> 5789.44
have to come from multiple sources at

5786.23 --> 5792.44
the same time or rise up from the ground

5789.44 --> 5796.07
as you mentioned right something like

5792.44 --> 5798.74
that and I can I personally just offer

5796.07 --> 5805.04
some suspicious um gut feeling I have of

5798.74 --> 5806.84
that old topic sure I do think there has

5805.04 --> 5808.67
been a lot of history that's been

5806.84 --> 5810.5
Minette manipulated that's quite obvious

5808.67 --> 5814.25
I mean this stuff will talk to schools

5810.5 --> 5818.96
is so so one-dimensional and simplistic

5814.25 --> 5824.69
it's just obviously filled with crap but

5818.96 --> 5827.12
the idea of the mud might might be a red

5824.69 --> 5829.3099999999995
hair it just don't make people noticing

5827.12 --> 5832.91
oh geez I'm just suggesting I'm just it

5829.31 --> 5835.580000000001
might yeah now but the why why it

5832.91 --> 5838.55
happens that's the big question that's

5835.58 --> 5841.43
the big mystery I think it happened it

5838.55 --> 5843.89
happened and so much because of it

5841.43 --> 5846.56
happened then I think the Netherlands

5843.89 --> 5850.1900000000005
was practically created because of it

5846.56 --> 5851.660000000001
they started building dikes because of

5850.19 --> 5854.379999999999
it that probably would have never

5851.66 --> 5858.97
happened if the mud flood didn't happen

5854.38 --> 5864.35
wait so there's a lot to suggest that

5858.97 --> 5867.650000000001
mankind has had a level of knowledge and

5864.35 --> 5869.93
technology that's on par with what we

5867.65 --> 5872.66
have to today or maybe even surpass the

5869.93 --> 5874.55
surpassing it absolutely but in all

5872.66 --> 5877.01
directions they didn't have Mike

5874.55 --> 5880.0
electronic finish and probably was

5877.01 --> 5885.349
living in a general state of peace

5880.0 --> 5888.349
compared to what we have now so I think

5885.349 --> 5891.77
the mud flood whatever was basically a

5888.349 --> 5894.92
reset to kind of wipe that out and

5891.77 --> 5897.92
replace it with all this crap we had

5894.92 --> 5903.139
today now was it and it happened into

5897.92 --> 5905.179
1800s yeah so it's quite recent yeah we

5903.139 --> 5913.400000000001
were living in a utopian society so

5905.179 --> 5915.7390000000005
recently reset and that's why they

5913.4 --> 5918.619
created this idea of the Industrial

5915.739 --> 5922.009999999999
Revolution which has gotten us to what

5918.619 --> 5926.058999999999
we have now so yeah that's the industry

5922.01 --> 5929.3
my name's actually so is it fair to sit

5926.059 --> 5932.860000000001
is it fair to speculate then that all

5929.3 --> 5942.59
history prior to these mud floods he's

5932.86 --> 5946.13
made up no yes no no it's not but no no

5942.59 --> 5949.610000000001
it's not but there is a lot missing it's

5946.13 --> 5952.13
just been erased technology both

5949.61 --> 5954.739
developments have been erased and cover

5952.13 --> 5956.869
stories for certain war tactics

5954.739 --> 5959.209999999999
technologies have been filled in yes

5956.869 --> 5962.329
some things maybe have been replaced but

5959.21 --> 5964.13
I think that most of the general lines

5962.329 --> 5966.71
of things that haven't happened in the

5964.13 --> 5968.9890000000005
society and culture did indeed take

5966.71 --> 5972.11
place as they did it's very rare that

5968.989 --> 5975.65
the controllers would completely invent

5972.11 --> 5978.29
a new group that never exists like the

5975.65 --> 5980.949
Romans are probably they probably never

5978.29 --> 5987.5
existed in the way that is suggested

5980.949 --> 5993.07
it's very rare that they do that so they

5987.5 --> 5993.07
race to tart Aryans for example but yeah

5994.96 --> 6000.52
can we then speculate further and say

5997.82 --> 6005.409
that is it possible that the Illuminati

6000.52 --> 6008.139
or the other bodies that be hell's that

6005.409 --> 6011.379999999999
they still have access to

6008.139 --> 6013.57
Advanced Technology yes that we wanted

6011.38 --> 6015.61
and more well

6013.57 --> 6017.949
wait let me let me ask this question I

6015.61 --> 6019.78
know we have a lot of information on the

6017.949 --> 6022.388999999999
internet about how the Illuminati is

6019.78 --> 6024.599
people and the Masons are evil but if we

6022.389 --> 6026.53
take the names in and up themselves

6024.599 --> 6028.059
Illuminati it doesn't sound like a

6026.53 --> 6031.209
nugget it sounds like the people that

6028.059 --> 6032.860000000001
were maybe illuminate us AFER's in the

6031.209 --> 6035.169
Masons were the people who built all

6032.86 --> 6038.589999999999
this good stuff made of stone not the

6035.169 --> 6041.409
crap we've seen today so right it's time

6038.59 --> 6046.38
it's what I'm thinking I think that the

6041.409 --> 6051.669
original prime concern of the Freemasons

6046.38 --> 6054.519
was to guard the technology to prevent

6051.669 --> 6056.919
it from falling into the hands of could

6054.519 --> 6059.979
you destroy everything and then the

6056.919 --> 6063.039
Illuminati came and they actually used

6059.979 --> 6064.929
those technologies or some of them to

6063.039 --> 6066.059
absolutely dominate and control

6064.929 --> 6068.86
everything

6066.059 --> 6072.039
what if we're to learn that all these

6068.86 --> 6074.739
so-called evil institutions were

6072.039 --> 6079.059
actually just victims of it let's say a

6074.739 --> 6083.978999999999
coup d'etat they got occupied by yes by

6079.059 --> 6085.269
sick [ __ ] they were that's exactly

6083.979 --> 6088.749000000001
what I said that that's what the

6085.269 --> 6090.939
Illuminati did Rd you could even calling

6088.749 --> 6093.07
them the Illuminati is even wrong is the

6090.939 --> 6096.6990000000005
original Illuminati were probably the

6093.07 --> 6098.558999999999
the key illuminated the key holders to

6096.699 --> 6100.539
the most important knowledge there was

6098.559 --> 6102.610000000001
extremely dangerous and they were the

6100.539 --> 6104.978999999999
only ones deemed responsible enough to

6102.61 --> 6106.989
keep it that's what probably happened

6104.979 --> 6109.269
and then they were corrupted they were

6106.989 --> 6119.648999999999
taking over and the Illuminati turned

6109.269 --> 6123.219
into our way pretty sure that that is

6119.649 --> 6125.860000000001
what happened one way or the other well

6123.219 --> 6128.469
well well it makes sense that the Masons

6125.86 --> 6131.679
there would have been the ones with the

6128.469 --> 6132.939
expertise in stone stone works etc they

6131.679 --> 6138.899
could quite easily have turned this

6132.939 --> 6141.429
stone to mud well causing the floods

6138.899 --> 6144.849
they're technically advanced

6141.429 --> 6148.86
said good if we're living in a world run

6144.849 --> 6152.499
by whatever you want to call it

6148.86 --> 6155.768999999999
psychopaths and I think to me it seems

6152.499 --> 6157.239
like these institutions the Masons you

6155.769 --> 6159.13
know the people that know how to build

6157.239 --> 6161.678999999999
stuff the Illuminati the people that

6159.13 --> 6163.479
knew had the knowledge and and the

6161.679 --> 6165.4490000000005
Philosopher's these people just

6163.479 --> 6168.610000000001
something happened and they got

6165.449 --> 6170.289
basically there's insurgents either

6168.61 --> 6172.719
whatever you want to call them they had

6170.289 --> 6174.518999999999
a coup d'etat and now there's insurgents

6172.719 --> 6179.979
are occupying all these institutions

6174.519 --> 6182.7390000000005
yeah like I mean what's just just a word

6179.979 --> 6184.780000000001
what's wrong with a three somebody that

6182.739 --> 6187.388999999999
doesn't need a license and a permit and

6184.78 --> 6191.139
regulation free mason somebody who's

6187.389 --> 6194.099
free to build good things like sounds

6191.139 --> 6198.039
treated to destroy as well I believe

6194.099 --> 6200.26
well it sounds really good right up to

6198.039 --> 6203.559
the time you find out who they worship

6200.26 --> 6208.209
and that's and that's basically demonic

6203.559 --> 6211.389
worship what if the Giants that control

6208.209 --> 6214.619
the outer layer of the world we live in

6211.389 --> 6217.2390000000005
that it was hidden from us by the ball

6214.619 --> 6220.959
which is what Satanists are meant to

6217.239 --> 6224.558999999999
protect the fact that there's giants

6220.959 --> 6226.329
running around are how our little green

6224.559 --> 6229.229
house that we built for ourselves

6226.329 --> 6229.228999999999
thinking we're invincible

6230.01 --> 6242.7390000000005
I believe what Giants go they got killed

6238.869 --> 6244.869
duh flood flood most of them got killed

6242.739 --> 6247.539
what survived mingled in with humans and

6244.869 --> 6249.728999999999
then were hunted down well why is it

6247.539 --> 6252.518999999999
would be adding three-quarters of the

6249.729 --> 6257.38
planet from well what would the giant

6252.519 --> 6259.329000000001
human population ratio have been I don't

6257.38 --> 6263.019
have any joints in here with them I

6259.329 --> 6266.619
don't know but clearly some joint were

6263.019 --> 6271.539000000001
they have big with the joints have been

6266.619 --> 6272.959
you think ladies six 30 60 feet tall

6271.539 --> 6274.759999999999
somewhere between there

6272.959 --> 6278.059
that's what's that he made his that's

6274.76 --> 6283.039000000001
before the flood that's before the board

6278.059 --> 6287.389
yes there were joints off the joints

6283.039 --> 6291.59
existed after the flood according to our

6287.389 --> 6294.05
would not what I said I said that the

6291.59 --> 6297.019
biggest ones didn't survive

6294.05 --> 6300.05
Oh others that the you could call him

6297.019 --> 6302.570000000001
half Giants and once they were just like

6300.05 --> 6305.4490000000005
twice as tall as humans some of them

6302.57 --> 6308.299999999999
could probably intermingle cross-species

6305.449 --> 6312.018999999999
with humans maybe even quite twice as

6308.3 --> 6315.499
tall or thirty feet twice as tall look

6312.019 --> 6318.889
Giants don't they're not born like as

6315.499 --> 6320.3
big as a story they grow they start out

6318.889 --> 6321.4890000000005
relatively small and they keep on

6320.3 --> 6329.05
growing forever

6321.489 --> 6331.61
that's giant they do start growing oh

6329.05 --> 6334.76
they sparked they start out they stop

6331.61 --> 6337.249
growing eventually maybe depends on the

6334.76 --> 6338.659000000001
conditions if there's enough energy

6337.249 --> 6340.4
around them if they have enough food

6338.659 --> 6342.289
then they may keep on growing but the

6340.4 --> 6344.15
bigger they grow the more food or the

6342.289 --> 6348.289
more energy they need to be able to

6344.15 --> 6351.92
survive sure so what would they spend on

6348.289 --> 6352.489
join something amazing the size of the

6351.92 --> 6355.34
pond

6352.489 --> 6360.678999999999
how big a crocodile can grow and that's

6355.34 --> 6364.63
how giant yeah okay this other 3/4 of

6360.679 --> 6364.63
the planet the weird hidden from

6366.639 --> 6373.309
connections that's true we don't know

6370.999 --> 6376.159
we're guessing but we're guessing at the

6373.309 --> 6379.34
fact that we got the itty bitty chunk

6376.159 --> 6381.768999999999
out of the really big one and that's why

6379.34 --> 6384.7390000000005
they came sorry oh it's just a segment

6381.769 --> 6388.189
it's just one realm out of three right

6384.739 --> 6391.699
excuse me ten realms and men to the ball

6388.189 --> 6394.159000000001
I have to change excuse me guys have to

6391.699 --> 6396.259999999999
change internet connection I might drop

6394.159 --> 6400.4
by the hope I don't this is interesting

6396.26 --> 6403.900000000001
please come give us a sec sure next time

6400.4 --> 6403.9
I tell you the drinking you're yours

6405.98 --> 6417.0199999999995
the show I will see what I was talking

6414.14 --> 6420.320000000001
about segments but here's the thing what

6417.02 --> 6422.72
did they hide what did they hide when

6420.32 --> 6426.83
they were delayed is there a delay and

6422.72 --> 6430.43
when I talk to the YouTube thing yeah -

6426.83 --> 6433.34
you know - the YouTube I'm asking to you

6430.43 --> 6435.17
I don't know I hope not because every

6433.34 --> 6437.6
time I start a sentenced and like after

6435.17 --> 6439.43
one second you immediately start

6437.6 --> 6443.660000000001
interrupting and it happened several

6439.43 --> 6447.22
times now it's really annoying I try not

6443.66 --> 6450.889999999999
to do it myself all right

6447.22 --> 6457.39
what would you have guessed the average

6450.89 --> 6457.39
lifespan of a giant to thing average I

6457.63 --> 6467.18
think they can technically live

6459.92 --> 6473.15
eternally as long as they can feed you

6467.18 --> 6477.08
know energy or well the chemical like

6473.15 --> 6480.4
yeah flesh anything they I think that

6477.08 --> 6487.13
Giants can devour pretty much anything

6480.4 --> 6490.48
people yeah sure each other even as a

6487.13 --> 6490.4800000000005
humanoid yes

6492.609 --> 6499.689
right so they existed or didn't exist

6496.959 --> 6502.889
after the mud flood there's remnants of

6499.689 --> 6506.05
them yes okay and they probably

6502.889 --> 6508.51
intermingled with humanity and the wider

6506.05 --> 6513.03
human society probably has their

6508.51 --> 6516.280000000001
remnants of giant dormant genes in them

6513.03 --> 6519.669
all over they all of them made probably

6516.28 --> 6521.289
everyone like sort of gravitate towards

6519.669 --> 6524.949
basketball though don't they

6521.289 --> 6525.909
sorry they kind of gravitate towards

6524.949 --> 6538.03
basketball

6525.909 --> 6540.6089999999995
oh no look there may be certain racial

6538.03 --> 6543.969
groups enough Jay over generalizing but

6540.609 --> 6547.3
rather like specific type of tribes that

6543.969 --> 6549.999
might have unusual large or long people

6547.3 --> 6552.729
and yet they might have at some point in

6549.999 --> 6555.938999999999
very very far back maybe even before the

6552.729 --> 6558.339
front have intermingled with the Giants

6555.939 --> 6561.479
of have taken on properties exchange

6558.339 --> 6563.919
properties so they are individually tall

6561.479 --> 6565.51
but that's it have to be pretty but

6563.919 --> 6567.129
that's not the type of intermingling

6565.51 --> 6569.379
that I'm talking about I'm talking about

6567.129 --> 6570.879
sexual intermingling love gymnast yeah

6569.379 --> 6574.239
that's what I thought what you mean yeah

6570.879 --> 6576.749
you'd have to be a pretty list you'd

6574.239 --> 6580.148999999999
have to be a pretty loose female woman

6576.749 --> 6582.429
like a female human to accept the giant

6580.149 --> 6584.499000000001
object no not necessarily because when

6582.429 --> 6586.629
the Giants are young there is a time

6584.499 --> 6594.629
where they're just as large as you

6586.629 --> 6597.039
probably under age six how old's a joint

6594.629 --> 6599.889
would a joint be when they're the size

6597.039 --> 6605.349
to fit a human female they would

6599.889 --> 6608.079
probably be around between 50 and 30 and

6605.349 --> 6610.979
after that rock did I drop word to a

6608.079 --> 6613.919
large or something

6610.979 --> 6619.149
did I age back what you said 50 and 30

6613.919 --> 6622.469
between 15 and 30 years or 15 but my

6619.149 --> 6622.469
apologies I thought you said 50

6623.88 --> 6630.9800000000005
[Applause]

6626.3 --> 6636.63
that's my mortgage you are going on the

6630.98 --> 6638.849999999999
baby's very childlike up to age 50 I

6636.63 --> 6643.2300000000005
don't know I'm just speculating what I

6638.85 --> 6647.1900000000005
do am pretty certain of is that they did

6643.23 --> 6650.009999999999
not they were not born Giants and they

6647.19 --> 6653.16
do not copulate as Giants

6650.01 --> 6656.22
that's all in the human-sized face I

6653.16 --> 6658.139999999999
think that James grow and then they turn

6656.22 --> 6659.7300000000005
big they don't stop growing that is what

6658.14 --> 6664.59
the Giants really are they are jus

6659.73 --> 6666.78
altered you enoyed basically what what

6664.59 --> 6670.02
sort of colored skin would you think I

6666.78 --> 6673.83
would have had all kinds black skin

6670.02 --> 6675.42
white skin red sneer all the colors all

6673.83 --> 6680.88
the colors man had and there were

6675.42 --> 6686.82
different tribes so they were pretty

6680.88 --> 6689.43
much like humans only bigger yeah partly

6686.82 --> 6693.96
having six thousand six fingers for

6689.43 --> 6698.1
example okay so in the 1800s when the

6693.96 --> 6700.59
mud flood he history was rewritten and

6698.1 --> 6705.150000000001
the Giants were hunted down and killed

6700.59 --> 6707.01
is is that what we know that all the

6705.15 --> 6708.36
Giants were already killed there might

6707.01 --> 6711.3
have been some remnants but they would

6708.36 --> 6713.46
be hiding already I'm confused sorry I

6711.3 --> 6714.09
thought you said there was some evidence

6713.46 --> 6716.91
of giants

6714.09 --> 6719.16
after the mud 400 after the act not the

6716.91 --> 6722.849999999999
mud flood the flood the great flood

6719.16 --> 6724.05
water flood alright okay this is the

6722.85 --> 6725.1
first I'm hearing of that I was I

6724.05 --> 6727.8
thought we're talking about the mud

6725.1 --> 6729.63
flood no no the mud flood was during an

6727.8 --> 6734.43
age where humans were already pretty

6729.63 --> 6738.27
much had taken over everything right

6734.43 --> 6741.06
okay now I've got my chronolog

6738.27 --> 6745.8
chronologically chronologically sorted

6741.06 --> 6749.54
story so the the the Giants would have

6745.8 --> 6749.54
been what around before Christ

6749.78 --> 6757.08
definitely

6751.5 --> 6761.82
christ was after the flood you would

6757.08 --> 6764.34
never know how long that I know the

6761.82 --> 6767.099999999999
sequence of events in Christ was after

6764.34 --> 6769.56
the flood was in the Classical period

6767.1 --> 6771.0
even where most of the giant would have

6769.56 --> 6775.85
been dead and where there was a lot of

6771.0 --> 6778.17
desolation and people would start out

6775.85 --> 6781.02
nomadic the sand there might have been a

6778.17 --> 6784.4400000000005
tartarean Empire and all kinds of other

6781.02 --> 6788.780000000001
things have the evolved ancient

6784.44 --> 6788.78
societies that might have survived

6791.1 --> 6795.6
could you just change that to Jesus

6793.35 --> 6797.52
Christ just believe it or not it makes a

6795.6 --> 6798.21
huge difference what are you talking

6797.52 --> 6801.330000000001
about

6798.21 --> 6803.91
you said Christ right which is popular

6801.33 --> 6808.8
and I'm saying that that's how they get

6803.91 --> 6811.62
it introduced into current everyday yeah

6808.8 --> 6814.2
sorry no I don't need to be dictated in

6811.62 --> 6815.22
what words to use for what reason I will

6814.2 --> 6818.04
call it Christ

6815.22 --> 6821.52
and when I address him I will address

6818.04 --> 6825.03
him as Jesus Christ but Christ is the

6821.52 --> 6828.72
energy it is the frequency it is the

6825.03 --> 6831.5
guide light to the path its greatness

6828.72 --> 6834.93
that's three different actually entities

6831.5 --> 6838.59
Jesus that's really nice I don't give a

6834.93 --> 6843.42
crap ok mark will you please shove your

6838.59 --> 6846.21
satanic lore back up your ass because I

6843.42 --> 6852.21
don't want that to be part of this show

6846.21 --> 6856.2300000000005
thank you very much no let's let's join

6852.21 --> 6858.06
them so back to the mud flood any more

6856.23 --> 6860.599999999999
questions about that or I'm gonna round

6858.06 --> 6860.6
out the show

6861.41 --> 6868.92
okay what's the get covered up now I got

6867.57 --> 6870.45
confused cause I thought we were talking

6868.92 --> 6872.45
about the mud floods and then you'd then

6870.45 --> 6875.58
used to be talking about the great flood

6872.45 --> 6881.46
right so I have to reevaluate my thought

6875.58 --> 6883.23
processes and put everything yeah we're

6881.46 --> 6885.719
talking about the Giants and still

6883.23 --> 6888.15
talking about the flood and when we're

6885.719 --> 6890.85
referring to the flood I thought we were

6888.15 --> 6892.17
referring to the mud flood but we

6890.85 --> 6892.650000000001
actually weren't and I wasn't aware of

6892.17 --> 6897.719
that

6892.65 --> 6899.8099999999995
I couldn't understand why it was really

6897.719 --> 6902.25
important to understand how Giants work

6899.81 --> 6907.38
considering they live on the outskirts

6902.25 --> 6909.96
of where we don't you don't know that

6907.38 --> 6910.83
that's a leap on the outskirts of where

6909.96 --> 6914.13
we don't leave

6910.83 --> 6915.66
well what's after look at it this way

6914.13 --> 6919.64
here's here's how it works

6915.66 --> 6923.19
we are told that Antarctica is the edge

6919.64 --> 6925.83
flat earthers believe that there's a

6923.19 --> 6932.419999999999
huge ice wall whatever is passed the ice

6925.83 --> 6932.42
wall nobody know so far so good right

6932.6 --> 6940.9800000000005
top you you mean disc scientism flat

6938.01 --> 6944.2390000000005
earthers that okay just have the model

6940.98 --> 6947.7
and opposed everything with their set

6944.239 --> 6949.62
way of how it is supposed to be pre

6947.7 --> 6953.929999999999
supposed to be right really they're

6949.62 --> 6957.39
fighting you I didn't know I fight them

6953.93 --> 6960.900000000001
didn't know that but regardless of that

6957.39 --> 6963.18
disc flat earthers are told that there's

6960.9 --> 6965.4
nothing past the disc that after the

6963.18 --> 6967.89
disc there's a dope pretty much right

6965.4 --> 6969.78
like pretty much like however far a

6967.89 --> 6973.469
couple of miles down the road bang

6969.78 --> 6976.71
there's a dome what if there's a heck of

6973.469 --> 6982.26
a lot more land that they needed to

6976.71 --> 6984.68
cover up what if it's that angle that

6982.26 --> 6987.39
they decided well how do we cover up a

6984.68 --> 6990.360000000001
whole Rock Island what we take what we

6987.39 --> 6993.4400000000005
got turn it into a ball invent a whole

6990.36 --> 6993.44
new ideology

6994.8 --> 7004.62
what if that's what happened 200 years

6997.45 --> 7006.23
ago because according to what those

7004.62 --> 7009.57
folks that you don't want to talk about

7006.23 --> 7013.889999999999
that they're paying big bucks to

7009.57 --> 7018.599999999999
introduce into general mainstream as far

7013.89 --> 7020.22
as how everything is done goes those are

7018.6 --> 7022.26
the same folks by the way that say the

7020.22 --> 7024.51
compass points up and down remember I

7022.26 --> 7027.09
like that by the way that's not one I

7024.51 --> 7029.1900000000005
don't know who came up with that a

7027.09 --> 7032.22
compass does not point up and down I

7029.19 --> 7036.8099999999995
really like those the idea that that

7032.22 --> 7039.95
person's invented but other than that we

7036.81 --> 7044.570000000001
hid three-quarters of the planet or more

7039.95 --> 7044.57
why Arwen

7048.409 --> 7053.96
nobody this is one of those where I

7051.05 --> 7056.650000000001
talked and she was cut off a long time

7053.96 --> 7056.65
ago wasn't

7064.54 --> 7078.07
oh I've been gone for two hours now

7075.9 --> 7080.28
yeah when you got to do something about

7078.07 --> 7086.049999999999
that teammates going right through you

7080.28 --> 7089.5199999999995
know what that T it's going right no oh

7086.05 --> 7092.95
that's because I drink a lot of it yeah

7089.52 --> 7095.71
well I basically asked why they decided

7092.95 --> 7098.98
to come up with the ball in the first

7095.71 --> 7101.26
place yeah to imprison uh that's the

7098.98 --> 7103.929999999999
most obvious reason and I've been saying

7101.26 --> 7107.2
it yeah they have suggested the disk

7103.93 --> 7110.5
model to capture us with an edge with a

7107.2 --> 7113.889999999999
border with a dome right yeah I I know

7110.5 --> 7117.54
that saying that for three years three

7113.89 --> 7121.0
years but here's so it's a conspiracy

7117.54 --> 7123.28
inside a conspiracy yeah it's a control

7121.0 --> 7126.52
opposition conspiracy it's a concept

7123.28 --> 7130.599999999999
it's another prison shot or Matt Chinese

7126.52 --> 7133.870000000001
dolls conspiracies I don't know Chinese

7130.6 --> 7137.97
dolls he opened one doll there's another

7133.87 --> 7137.97
doll inside open a next door if you know

7138.75 --> 7145.63
action go yeah yes Russian maker just

7144.22 --> 7156.13
across the board or something is matter

7145.63 --> 7158.38
screw my yes so yeah I agree to that the

7156.13 --> 7162.1
rectangular looping model plays into

7158.38 --> 7164.47
that and could that also be another

7162.1 --> 7167.860000000001
conspiracy within a conspiracy within

7164.47 --> 7171.13
another consumer see anything going I'm

7167.86 --> 7174.7
so working on it yeah where did you come

7171.13 --> 7176.74
up with the looping model you said

7174.7 --> 7179.139999999999
something you made up or is that I saw

7176.74 --> 7186.4
something I don't know if I made it up

7179.14 --> 7187.240000000001
or if your visions okay did you still

7186.4 --> 7189.5199999999995
have your visions

7187.24 --> 7193.8
no it's an experience I had I just

7189.52 --> 7193.8
remember it when did I stop

7197.08 --> 7203.88
the last conscious time I experienced

7199.51 --> 7203.88
this experience it was in 2012

7206.33 --> 7211.43
do you wake up with your heart racing in

7208.49 --> 7216.23
your body covered in sweat no oh that's

7211.43 --> 7218.18
good yeah no but look when that [ __ ]

7216.23 --> 7222.169999999999
happened you better damn well believe

7218.18 --> 7225.77
that i was feverishly a panic panicked

7222.17 --> 7230.42
and completely broken after that for a

7225.77 --> 7231.4400000000005
period so yeah they must have had quite

7230.42 --> 7234.89
a toll on you

7231.44 --> 7236.179999999999
it did extreme and that's what that's

7234.89 --> 7240.02
what what the purpose of it was

7236.18 --> 7243.13
eventually because they overdid it and

7240.02 --> 7247.88
they forced me to undergo that [ __ ] and

7243.13 --> 7252.25
yeah don't take this in the conviction

7247.88 --> 7255.71
that they could break me and kind of did

7252.25 --> 7257.66
don't take this the wrong way but I do I

7255.71 --> 7260.33
do need to ask and I hope you understand

7257.66 --> 7265.91
were you on drugs at the time I just

7260.33 --> 7268.76
told you they sorry fed drugs to me

7265.91 --> 7273.41
stuff that I have no access to that I

7268.76 --> 7275.63
don't want to break me so yeah yeah you

7273.41 --> 7279.95
get that from that especially you don't

7275.63 --> 7281.6900000000005
want to take it your force are you

7279.95 --> 7292.28
coming are you coming from the line that

7281.69 --> 7294.469999999999
drugs are bad alright so especially when

7292.28 --> 7297.53
you saw my teddy bear being forced on

7294.47 --> 7299.18
you yeah how did they force them on you

7297.53 --> 7302.139999999999
that they're coming to your house and

7299.18 --> 7305.87
just yeah I'm just they had people in

7302.14 --> 7309.25
uniforms police uniforms with guns just

7305.87 --> 7313.16
collect me and then under threat of fire

7309.25 --> 7315.77
take whatever died what what did you do

7313.16 --> 7325.91
to draw their attention they did this to

7315.77 --> 7328.790000000001
you out of obliviousness because of my

7325.91 --> 7330.86
amnesia I had no idea really well that

7328.79 --> 7334.06
guy was really

7330.86 --> 7339.17
I forgot it all

7334.06 --> 7342.9490000000005
contacted him and yeah he did that to me

7339.17 --> 7346.6990000000005
so now I don't do that anymore I didn't

7342.949 --> 7351.25
contact him anymore so this is one guy

7346.699 --> 7355.669999999999
you contacted out of some some reason

7351.25 --> 7357.52
yeah I thought it was my friend oh right

7355.67 --> 7360.05
okay

7357.52 --> 7364.160000000001
instead you contacted someone who was

7360.05 --> 7369.05
placed to watch out now why you it is

7364.16 --> 7373.25
what he was I just didn't remember she

7369.05 --> 7375.56
contacted a watcher that's what they be

7373.25 --> 7378.77
you you call it a watcher I wouldn't be

7375.56 --> 7380.080000000001
so hastily to declare him that he you

7378.77 --> 7381.1990000000005
befriended him there not knowing

7380.08 --> 7385.61
unknowingly

7381.199 --> 7388.04
I you came in tonight that I troubled

7385.61 --> 7390.11
that are you scared to say you you're

7388.04 --> 7392.96
friends with this person would you

7390.11 --> 7395.9
rather say you came in contact with no I

7392.96 --> 7397.82
thought I was friends with him oh I

7395.9 --> 7401.33
tried to be friends with him and he

7397.82 --> 7405.16
turned out to be a total maniac and he

7401.33 --> 7417.0199999999995
grew worse as he aged in his maniacal T

7405.16 --> 7418.5199999999995
how old was he how old would you both

7417.02 --> 7429.410000000001
have been approximately could that might

7418.52 --> 7431.4800000000005
be asking oh I don't want to know about

7429.41 --> 7433.849999999999
him I just trying to get an idea when

7431.48 --> 7437.739
this happened and how old what what I

7433.85 --> 7437.7390000000005
ate what time in your life or you're at

7448.51 --> 7456.85
so first experience where you where you

7452.57 --> 7459.949
saw something outside of this realm and

7456.85 --> 7464.0
then you contact with somebody who

7459.949 --> 7466.5199999999995
turned out to say that no what you how

7464.0 --> 7467.72
are you getting this no you're

7466.52 --> 7469.46
misunderstanding

7467.72 --> 7472.64
misunderstanding what I'm saying you

7469.46 --> 7474.85
know calling him experiences separate

7472.64 --> 7478.400000000001
experiences and every time that happens

7474.85 --> 7481.01
an entire dream world is open up to me

7478.4 --> 7485.78
that's not parallel to the actual

7481.01 --> 7488.06
timeline okay in a separate experience

7485.78 --> 7491.3
like a giant giant never-ending

7488.06 --> 7494.360000000001
seemingly never-ending way to lose it

7491.3 --> 7496.34
type a dream then I wake up again get

7494.36 --> 7498.5599999999995
completely messed up from the entire

7496.34 --> 7500.09
overdose of information of everything I

7498.56 --> 7503.0
got including out of the future of

7500.09 --> 7504.8
things I can't handle yet and then I

7503.0 --> 7507.11
have to deal with it and I tend to go

7504.8 --> 7509.150000000001
completely nuts and then end up with

7507.11 --> 7511.82
amnesia relief that I don't remember

7509.15 --> 7513.589999999999
anything about it well if this is

7511.82 --> 7517.46
stressing you out we don't want to do

7513.59 --> 7520.1900000000005
that to you just putting emphasis on the

7517.46 --> 7523.34
actual level of the [ __ ] and why every

7520.19 --> 7526.969999999999
single time I talk about it I say don't

7523.34 --> 7530.51
do this it's not worth it it is so

7526.97 --> 7533.06
dangerous even if even if I couldn't say

7530.51 --> 7535.070000000001
it under controlled circumstances very

7533.06 --> 7536.96
smart people that I really trust and it

7535.07 --> 7539.9
was really confident I would probably

7536.96 --> 7542.81
still not do it because it is just too

7539.9 --> 7544.73
freaking dangerous willingly put

7542.81 --> 7551.81
yourself into this state what do you

7544.73 --> 7553.549999999999
need to have substance yeah these things

7551.81 --> 7554.54
are in my memory and they're probably

7553.55 --> 7560.42
never gonna go away

7554.54 --> 7561.92
whether I want to or not have you ever

7560.42 --> 7564.47
looked at the fact that you were told

7561.92 --> 7567.11
stuff and you're not you know nobody

7564.47 --> 7569.06
gets to pick who they tell but the

7567.11 --> 7571.759999999999
moment you were told this stuff and

7569.06 --> 7577.63
apparently stuff that you cannot handle

7571.76 --> 7581.95
from the other side and you're basically

7577.63 --> 7581.95
handling or you're the way

7585.26 --> 7591.9400000000005
that's absolutely lost him yeah I'm not

7588.73 --> 7597.3099999999995
sad about it really because he's

7591.94 --> 7601.91
interrupting me halfway again and know

7597.31 --> 7603.68
I'm not being told about anything I was

7601.91 --> 7607.3099999999995
talking about being unsettled of

7603.68 --> 7610.76
actually experiencing experiences from

7607.31 --> 7613.0
another time including from myself and

7610.76 --> 7617.42
that's something you can't handle

7613.0 --> 7620.48
because you're experiencing things from

7617.42 --> 7622.7300000000005
the future through yourself experiencing

7620.48 --> 7624.709999999999
everything that you've become an added

7622.73 --> 7626.9
and changed on top of what you actually

7624.71 --> 7630.26
are during the experience and that is

7626.9 --> 7635.69
extremely unsettling it's stress your

7630.26 --> 7637.25
consciousness drains you it's um it's

7635.69 --> 7640.46
like you projected yourself out of your

7637.25 --> 7642.77
own yes that in current state it is what

7640.46 --> 7655.43
happened how far in the future do you

7642.77 --> 7657.080000000001
think you I still been puzzling but from

7655.43 --> 7665.8
what I could understand it was pretty

7657.08 --> 7674.8099999999995
much 80 years ideas from from now

7665.8 --> 7679.34
okay when was that 90 70 decide yeah so

7674.81 --> 7681.7390000000005
elaborate so bizarre and also in

7679.34 --> 7684.5
retrospect I am figuring out that parts

7681.739 --> 7687.2
of the things that I have seen are not

7684.5 --> 7690.64
literal and were actually grafted in by

7687.2 --> 7693.71
the dark ones where they abused my

7690.64 --> 7698.84
imagination to project a false reality

7693.71 --> 7701.45
in between parts it's just so complex

7698.84 --> 7707.05
the entire thing it's like being forced

7701.45 --> 7710.0599999999995
to watch a movie a lifetime long movie

7707.05 --> 7711.77
without actually having control over how

7710.06 --> 7713.9890000000005
you're watching it and there's other

7711.77 --> 7716.96
people just forcing you to watch stuff

7713.989 --> 7718.82
about it especially and instead

7716.96 --> 7722.6
inserting saying so demon

7718.82 --> 7725.48
in settings and inserting signs into the

7722.6 --> 7728.780000000001
movie which are necessarily with

7725.48 --> 7732.74
misleading then we're constantly trying

7728.78 --> 7735.53
to use everything to mislead me to make

7732.74 --> 7740.42
me interpret things incorrectly what I

7735.53 --> 7743.2699999999995
was experiencing no I understand I

7740.42 --> 7749.42
understand I haven't experienced it but

7743.27 --> 7752.660000000001
I understand what you're saying is this

7749.42 --> 7762.32
is this uh is this something that anyone

7752.66 --> 7764.389999999999
can do I hope not to be honest to be

7762.32 --> 7768.71
fair I think that most people that would

7764.39 --> 7771.1
undergo the same level of the

7768.71 --> 7774.02
psychotropic be sure that I went through

7771.1 --> 7777.22
they would just if they were insane and

7774.02 --> 7781.580000000001
probably kill themselves pretty quickly

7777.22 --> 7783.860000000001
do you think that with more life

7781.58 --> 7786.59
experience and maturity behind you now

7783.86 --> 7788.929999999999
or even in the next 10 to 20 years

7786.59 --> 7791.39
you might venture to try and go there

7788.93 --> 7793.820000000001
again to try and interpret it I think

7791.39 --> 7796.13
it's necessary because I already

7793.82 --> 7797.78
experienced everything I just couldn't

7796.13 --> 7801.05
handle it now all I have to do is

7797.78 --> 7803.15
remember that experience that I had in

7801.05 --> 7805.33
the past about the future that is still

7803.15 --> 7805.33
to come

7808.3 --> 7824.09
have you recorded any of this nothing do

7821.09 --> 7827.38
you get do you get a lot of my moments

7824.09 --> 7827.38
of deja vu because of it

7831.72 --> 7834.72
do you think you're interpreting it the

7833.73 --> 7838.29
wrong way

7834.72 --> 7842.46
no you can imply sir

7838.29 --> 7843.38
are you getting déjà vu now no not

7842.46 --> 7846.45
really

7843.38 --> 7848.52
okay so you haven't met me before I knew

7846.45 --> 7851.76
I was gonna do this I knew it was gonna

7848.52 --> 7854.370000000001
happen but you haven't maybe the forces

7851.76 --> 7856.5
used against me look most of what I got

7854.37 --> 7858.54
to see that I still have the best

7856.5 --> 7861.87
memories of is the things that were

7858.54 --> 7866.4
falsely used against me a piece of my

7861.87 --> 7867.42
memory being shoved in my face and that

7866.4 --> 7870.599999999999
way enhance

7867.42 --> 7874.41
almost like would you be willing to

7870.6 --> 7875.85
create a trauma from a future event to

7874.41 --> 7878.58
kind of derail it

7875.85 --> 7881.79
but it's not working anymore it did are

7878.58 --> 7884.13
you are you aware our when our when are

7881.79 --> 7886.8
you aware that the people that invented

7884.13 --> 7892.68
the globe of something called the

7886.8 --> 7897.45
targeted individuals program okay you'll

7892.68 --> 7900.51
have you ever heard the TI deport well

7897.45 --> 7903.929999999999
it was all Dutch so no not like that

7900.51 --> 7906.66
but if anything like that exists then

7903.93 --> 7909.42
I'm will what would have probably been

7906.66 --> 7912.57
one of these targets they did suggest

7909.42 --> 7915.39
that a lot but there were so many

7912.57 --> 7921.96
suggestions and I myself had some really

7915.39 --> 7924.27
weird ideas myself at the time so okay

7921.96 --> 7927.33
well see I'm trying to get the fact that

7924.27 --> 7930.42
somebody from what you call the other

7927.33 --> 7932.76
realms contacted you why you no one

7930.42 --> 7936.24
knows and that that's really irrelevant

7932.76 --> 7939.6900000000005
and then and then the folks on this end

7936.24 --> 7943.7
that are hoping to make society forget

7939.69 --> 7946.2
what you saw altered your perception

7943.7 --> 7948.72
complete and that's their job

7946.2 --> 7951.8099999999995
you've got quite big eyes quite good at

7948.72 --> 7954.030000000001
this okay very short correct

7951.81 --> 7956.88
yes that's exactly what they tried to do

7954.03 --> 7958.74
okay first tried to do is get me on

7956.88 --> 7961.8
their side and basically get me to

7958.74 --> 7965.16
surrender to evil and they put a lot of

7961.8 --> 7969.6
effort in that didn't clear workouts

7965.16 --> 7972.44
they abroad conference process I tried

7969.6 --> 7976.38
to make it impossible for them to

7972.44 --> 7981.349999999999
eventually create a set of where they

7976.38 --> 7981.35
could allow themselves to just kill me

7982.25 --> 7987.65
it's so they're not allowed to kill you

7987.0 --> 7990.33
Arlen

7987.65 --> 7994.7
how are you happy to talk about this so

7990.33 --> 7998.1
you put through the stop I'm fine

7994.7 --> 8001.28
alright but you I will pull on the

7998.1 --> 8004.79
brakes eventually because I find it very

8001.28 --> 8006.86
pushy are you the one booting me out and

8004.79 --> 8010.73
I have to keep words that something else

8006.86 --> 8013.3099999999995
now it's just that your energy is not

8010.73 --> 8017.69
appropriate to interact with me about

8013.31 --> 8023.63
this on this level mark that's it that's

8017.69 --> 8025.58
also why I'm getting agitated you're

8023.63 --> 8029.150000000001
tardy might mock Dynegy tardy

8025.58 --> 8033.2
think of my season I'm not I'm trying to

8029.15 --> 8036.49
figure out if he's cool again with who

8033.2 --> 8047.78
his friends are in one my friends no

8036.49 --> 8049.13
good story thank are they my friends but

8047.78 --> 8053.54
you know they've been playing this game

8049.13 --> 8057.53
a lot longer than you have right and

8053.54 --> 8063.11
they've been and they not and there you

8057.53 --> 8064.25
see they are not in the same world it's

8063.11 --> 8068.509999999999
not the same thing

8064.25 --> 8071.66
it's no the folks that are meant that I

8068.51 --> 8075.320000000001
call watchers are the ones that are

8071.66 --> 8078.71
meant to watch out should someone clue

8075.32 --> 8081.44
in the things like wait the earth isn't

8078.71 --> 8086.36
flat there isn't a barrier fifty feet

8081.44 --> 8088.94
past the ice wall those things

8086.36 --> 8092.23
the moment you start bringing those

8088.94 --> 8094.46
topics up they have ways of

8092.23 --> 8097.82
misconstruing you in the other direction

8094.46 --> 8098.9800000000005
and those are the basic ones what you

8097.82 --> 8101.38
had is a room

8098.98 --> 8103.45
Barbarin Singh that okay they do not

8101.38 --> 8105.55
approach me they have not approached me

8103.45 --> 8107.679999999999
again and they know better than to

8105.55 --> 8111.91
approach me because they know how I'm

8107.68 --> 8120.97
gonna respond this time which is the 180

8111.91 --> 8123.099999999999
degree response once that's the problem

8120.97 --> 8125.08
is nobody approaching me with this

8123.1 --> 8127.900000000001
nobody is doing this Marc you are

8125.08 --> 8129.73
suggesting new controllers their

8127.9 --> 8131.5
Watchers they're preventing us from

8129.73 --> 8133.53
stepping outside of this model well

8131.5 --> 8136.72
guess what they're not doing that

8133.53 --> 8140.2
they're not the ones that are doing it

8136.72 --> 8142.72
is the people themselves is the ballers

8140.2 --> 8145.15
that are forcing that are pressing the

8142.72 --> 8147.31
false dichotomy of the disk first of all

8145.15 --> 8149.259999999999
is the flat earthers that don't really

8147.31 --> 8151.54
dig into it and just latch onto the New

8149.26 --> 8153.400000000001
Scientist and disk model they're the

8151.54 --> 8155.98
ones doing it there's no controllers

8153.4 --> 8159.61
doing this there's nobody putting flat

8155.98 --> 8163.839999999999
earthers in line behind the scenes they

8159.61 --> 8168.5199999999995
don't need to because it is naturally

8163.84 --> 8170.2300000000005
occurring that's the difference so when

8168.52 --> 8170.9400000000005
this would have been completely

8170.23 --> 8174.07
different

8170.94 --> 8177.46
but now there's the internet they don't

8174.07 --> 8182.92
need to do that and they can't do it not

8177.46 --> 8187.78
like that no funny how most of the folks

8182.92 --> 8190.75
were screaming against the ballers but

8187.78 --> 8194.23
usually on the lower financial income

8190.75 --> 8198.01
level than the one it seems to be a huge

8194.23 --> 8206.56
correlation say it's a ball get a lot of

8198.01 --> 8209.08
money it is the cornerstone of the media

8206.56 --> 8211.24
culture of the media cult right now so

8209.08 --> 8214.539999999999
yeah there is stuff being sponsored

8211.24 --> 8216.969
if both if ball and science-fiction

8214.54 --> 8219.85
space and NASA stuff is introduced they

8216.969 --> 8223.0
pay for that that's right right okay

8219.85 --> 8226.69
they also have as you've also figured

8223.0 --> 8228.91
out they have a watcher program and the

8226.69 --> 8230.179
targeted individuals program I have not

8228.91 --> 8233.559
confirmed any of

8230.179 --> 8239.210000000001
no I'm just saying if you wanna talk oh

8233.559 --> 8242.778999999999
it was told to me all right but wouldn't

8239.21 --> 8246.319
you you don't think that logically if

8242.779 --> 8248.809000000001
you were placed to watch over a society

8246.319 --> 8251.949999999999
like guard dogs to make sure that they

8248.809 --> 8254.599
don't go past 50 feet past that ice wall

8251.95 --> 8256.639000000001
so they just said that's where the

8254.599 --> 8259.279
barrier starts that's of course that's

8256.639 --> 8262.309
where the military starts but regardless

8259.279 --> 8264.92
of the fire where where is this where's

8262.309 --> 8266.869999999999
what where are these people telling us

8264.92 --> 8282.229
you can't go beyond the barrier where

8266.87 --> 8283.58
are they this is going nowhere I was

8282.229 --> 8286.099
happy to chat to you about your

8283.58 --> 8288.349
experiences but it seems like he wants

8286.099 --> 8289.33
to he wants to ram it into you in some

8288.349 --> 8296.84
way or another

8289.33 --> 8304.639
oh yeah a weird who constructed the

8296.84 --> 8314.87
Masons smart shooter I want to cut this

8304.639 --> 8318.55
off let he made this Christmas pudding

8314.87 --> 8320.54
of a tin mine well see there's the

8318.55 --> 8325.069
linguists and you should go in at your

8320.54 --> 8327.559000000001
smoky eye I don't I don't sell wait all

8325.069 --> 8330.76
right Alan thank you right yes I'll see

8327.559 --> 8334.88
you guys later have a good Christmas

8330.76 --> 8338.210000000001
what's left of it still got two more

8334.88 --> 8339.949999999999
days so see you guys later thank you for

8338.21 --> 8342.278999999999
coming there's a long discussion goodbye

8339.95 --> 8342.279
mark

8346.88 --> 8349.88
so

8349.92 --> 8357.87
that was that piece at last it was a

8353.34 --> 8362.269
good conversation but it's too much that

8357.87 --> 8364.469000000001
I really I feel kind of inappropriate

8362.269 --> 8366.210000000001
talking about that on Christmas I don't

8364.469 --> 8368.428999999998
like being forced to talk about it

8366.21 --> 8370.559
although I do want to talk about it I

8368.429 --> 8373.889
would have liked to talk about it on

8370.559 --> 8377.609999999999
another date perhaps but yeah it is what

8373.889 --> 8381.21
it is it is very complex vision stuff is

8377.61 --> 8385.92
very complex I'm not planning on going

8381.21 --> 8389.929999999998
back to the dark world I don't need to

8385.92 --> 8391.5
there's nothing more there for me really

8389.93 --> 8393.51
not really

8391.5 --> 8397.38
I've already experienced anything I want

8393.51 --> 8400.62
to I would ever want out of it and I'm

8397.38 --> 8403.279999999999
much more curious in what I can do with

8400.62 --> 8409.67
my conscious in this linear timeline

8403.28 --> 8414.99
really feeling things out anticipating

8409.67 --> 8417.9
so merry Christmas everyone I hope you

8414.99 --> 8420.24
have a nice Christmas dinner with your

8417.9 --> 8423.63
family or with friends or whoever you're

8420.24 --> 8427.89
going to have it with and enjoy the

8423.63 --> 8431.25
returning of the lights the day cycle

8427.89 --> 8436.979
getting longer more Sun and the spring

8431.25 --> 8439.88
returning and yeah I guess no further

8436.979 --> 8443.34
debate so though nathan is still playing

8439.88 --> 8446.279999999999

8443.34 --> 8447.81
