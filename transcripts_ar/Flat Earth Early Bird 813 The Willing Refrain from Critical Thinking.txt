membership system join button

73.92 --> 79.04
that would be much appreciated so

79.68 --> 82.72000000000001
the weather today

83.04 --> 87.60000000000001
is a bit amazing

89.84 --> 95.36
all right but there's still some

93.68 --> 98.799
some coming through and it's still kind

95.36 --> 102.799
of warm outside not very windy

98.799 --> 102.799
it's a little bit moist though

105.119 --> 115.84
it's still still nice still plenty of

108.0 --> 115.84
people outside

118.479 --> 125.67999999999999
so so show still the

122.399 --> 129.679
uh the improvised format

125.68 --> 133.04000000000002
for the time being

129.679 --> 136.72
that's adam's been i guess too busy

133.04 --> 140.879
and i've been too distracted so it might

136.72 --> 144.08
persist for a while until it gets fixed

140.879 --> 145.04
but i don't know it is it's not that bad

144.08 --> 148.16000000000003
right

145.04 --> 150.07999999999998
i watched back the yesterday's show to

148.16 --> 151.28
see what it was like and it wasn't all

150.08 --> 153.12
that bad

151.28 --> 155.28
and yes my sound is a little

153.12 --> 157.76
asymmetrical

155.28 --> 159.36
but yeah i listened to my own shows on

157.76 --> 162.79999999999998
speakers

159.36 --> 164.239
so it's not too much of a problem so but

162.8 --> 167.92000000000002
i will try to get it

164.239 --> 171.44
fixed somewhere hopefully in the next

167.92 --> 174.39999999999998
in this coming week

171.44 --> 177.76
all right so anyway i got still got my

174.4 --> 177.76000000000002
breakfast coffee with me

181.44 --> 186.4
and fresh hot green tea

184.54 --> 199.63
[Music]

186.4 --> 200.8
and ajm is first in chat good to see you

199.63 --> 204.799
[Music]

200.8 --> 208.959
anyway it's monday monday the 22nd

204.799 --> 208.959
of february 2021

210.84 --> 216.08
uh

213.68 --> 216.08
let's see

219.519 --> 223.12
i completely forgot to make notes

221.2 --> 227.83999999999997
yesterday

223.12 --> 227.84
but yes saturday skipped and all that

233.84 --> 241.84
what did i do i pretty much ended up

237.12 --> 241.84
watching a lot of south park

242.239 --> 244.48000000000002
uh

246.08 --> 249.59900000000002
watched a bit of bible literally

249.68 --> 255.84
lots of fed uh premieres

280.84 --> 283.84
ah

286.639 --> 295.04
so how is everybody doing this

290.16 --> 298.32000000000005
monday morning i got up

295.04 --> 298.8
kind of tired it's weird but yeah i just

298.32 --> 300.96
had a

298.8 --> 303.68
bit of a tense night again very similar

300.96 --> 307.59999999999997
to the night before

303.68 --> 307.6
because of the mentioned reasons

312.32 --> 318.8
still waiting for some feedback from

315.52 --> 319.59999999999997
my lawyer i was hoping to get it this

318.8 --> 322.0
morning but

319.6 --> 324.24
only thing that happened is that just

322.0 --> 326.72
some random call

324.24 --> 328.32
and yeah and with no sound like in the

326.72 --> 330.32000000000005
morning that was really weird because i

328.32 --> 333.59999999999997
thought i was gonna be a lawyer

330.32 --> 336.479
but it wasn't so i haven't

333.6 --> 339.84000000000003
heard back but i'll get to that

336.479 --> 339.84
eventually i'm trying not to

342.16 --> 348.96000000000004
make it to make it let it make me too

346.0 --> 348.96
nervous is where

350.84 --> 353.84
uh

354.4 --> 357.44
and technically i don't think i should

356.16 --> 359.44
have to

357.44 --> 361.52
because again nothing really changed

359.44 --> 365.28
that much

361.52 --> 367.919
since last time something like

365.28 --> 367.919
this happen

378.84 --> 381.84
so

382.96 --> 387.52
yeah hopefully some more people will get

385.199 --> 391.199
into chat

387.52 --> 395.84
that would be great and can have some

391.199 --> 395.84000000000003
conversations going

400.639 --> 407.44
is there anything particularly

403.919 --> 423.52
noteworthy that has happened

407.44 --> 437.84
sins yesterday

423.52 --> 437.84
hello dr gunzo welcome back

448.72 --> 454.8
all right so in the meantime

452.16 --> 456.56
just watching the some of dutch

454.8 --> 460.56
alternative news

456.56 --> 463.36
it seems like there is a lot of people

460.56 --> 465.199
in the netherlands getting very active

463.36 --> 466.8
and basically pointing out the things

465.199 --> 469.52000000000004
that i've been saying

466.8 --> 471.28000000000003
of course and so many others as well but

469.52 --> 473.28
these people are putting it more to the

471.28 --> 476.55999999999995
front line it seems

473.28 --> 477.28
about how the entire corona situation is

476.56 --> 481.44
completely

477.28 --> 483.44
fake not even getting into whether the

481.44 --> 484.16
virus is real or not just that the

483.44 --> 488.4
measures

484.16 --> 490.56
make no sense and that this isn't

488.4 --> 493.919
about trying to protect the public

490.56 --> 497.919
against some supposed virus

493.919 --> 503.12
but instead just completely

497.919 --> 503.12
erasing the original mindset of

503.28 --> 508.23999999999995
of well they call it democracy right

506.4 --> 509.44
just the the regular freedoms and the

508.24 --> 512.719
values that

509.44 --> 515.76
people have been i guess fighting for

512.719 --> 517.279
against put against politics

515.76 --> 519.68
and there's a lot of people pointing out

517.279 --> 521.68
like this this is their move this is

519.68 --> 522.88
their move to get complete control over

521.68 --> 526.2399999999999
us

522.88 --> 529.04
through fraud and i'm glad that i

526.24 --> 530.5600000000001
am reading these messages on a more

529.04 --> 533.76
regular basis

530.56 --> 536.3199999999999
these articles because

533.76 --> 537.92
in a way i wish that i was some of these

536.32 --> 539.6800000000001
people and i could bring it more to the

537.92 --> 543.04
front line but then again

539.68 --> 546.0
you know i'm a flat earther so they'd

543.04 --> 549.12
probably not like me on the front line

546.0 --> 552.88
so i'm just glad that some other people

549.12 --> 563.839
that do have that opportunity to do that

552.88 --> 563.8389999999999
are doing that

564.64 --> 577.8389999999999
anyway uh hello miss crazy at

568.8 --> 577.8389999999999
indy franzen flatman

585.81 --> 589.01
[Music]

595.76 --> 605.8389999999999
so what do you guys gals have been up to

618.88 --> 623.04
god and i i got

625.519 --> 630.48
i got pressured into watching a really

627.76 --> 633.92
stupid conspiracy cast video

630.48 --> 634.72
again by flat side and because it was a

633.92 --> 636.4799999999999
lot about

634.72 --> 639.2
him apparently and he was going to make

636.48 --> 641.36
a response video to it

639.2 --> 643.6
it's just i hear that this sort of thing

641.36 --> 645.6800000000001
happens a lot of the time you know

643.6 --> 647.9200000000001
but then i actually watched the video

645.68 --> 650.56
and i'm like oh my god

647.92 --> 651.36
now i know why i don't watch because

650.56 --> 655.3599999999999
it's all so

651.36 --> 655.36
stupid it's all so dumb

656.079 --> 661.04
it's like why

659.12 --> 662.8
like if you're gonna be a baller why

661.04 --> 666.24
can't you just

662.8 --> 669.68
try to be a little bit more consistent

666.24 --> 671.76
and cohesive and logical

669.68 --> 674.0
it's almost like a sport to some of

671.76 --> 677.8389999999999
these ballers out there

674.0 --> 681.6
to make it really really dumb

677.839 --> 683.6800000000001
on purpose to make their ball defense

681.6 --> 685.9200000000001
really dumb i don't know why i don't

683.68 --> 689.1999999999999
know why they do it is that

685.92 --> 692.4799999999999
like some kind of audience targeting

689.2 --> 692.48
strategy or something

692.56 --> 697.04
because from a technical point of view

695.68 --> 702.56
it just makes

697.04 --> 704.24
them look so much dumber i mean

702.56 --> 705.68
if there were ballers out there that

704.24 --> 709.44
would have halfway

705.68 --> 714.0
interesting defenses

709.44 --> 717.12
or even accusations that were anywhere

714.0 --> 719.279
close to legitimate

717.12 --> 721.6
then yeah then it might be more

719.279 --> 722.88
interesting for me to go back and forth

721.6 --> 726.16
to them but it's just

722.88 --> 728.16
so much garbage now

726.16 --> 730.56
it probably always was it's just that

728.16 --> 732.639
it's it's worse

730.56 --> 736.0
it's not garbage by accident anymore

732.639 --> 736.0
it's like their style now

743.519 --> 759.839
so yeah that that's about it

764.0 --> 769.12
what am i drinking tea drinking green

766.8 --> 769.12
tea

771.519 --> 774.8
how about the southern celestial pole

774.079 --> 777.1999999999999
point

774.8 --> 779.519
of rotation you mean the apparent point

777.2 --> 782.5600000000001
of the apparent

779.519 --> 783.6
demi globe of the heavens that appears

782.56 --> 787.1199999999999
to rotate around

783.6 --> 790.0
us well it has an apparent

787.12 --> 792.24
southern point of rotation or at least

790.0 --> 793.839
that southern point of rotation seems to

792.24 --> 798.639
be

793.839 --> 800.639
anchored into the angle to the south

798.639 --> 802.88
however the orientation of the earth may

800.639 --> 805.92
be right

802.88 --> 808.959
i i know that that ballers really

805.92 --> 811.36
prefer when the celestial southern

808.959 --> 813.1999999999999
point supposedly is brought up i know

811.36 --> 816.32
that they insist to

813.2 --> 819.44
imagine this thing as an obstacle

816.32 --> 821.0400000000001
on a disc model right

819.44 --> 823.44
that's where it gets a little weird it's

821.04 --> 826.639
like oh but how does the

823.44 --> 830.5600000000001
you the presumed euclidean

826.639 --> 834.16
angle of the southern rotation point

830.56 --> 838.2399999999999
rotate around you

834.16 --> 841.68
as you move around the presumed

838.24 --> 844.24
north pole point on the presupposed disc

841.68 --> 845.519
earth right yeah that that does make it

844.24 --> 848.639
a little weird it's still just

845.519 --> 851.92
visual though so in my

848.639 --> 854.5600000000001
view i don't see too many

851.92 --> 856.3199999999999
true problems because there is no

854.56 --> 861.04
physical nature to any of the

856.32 --> 861.0400000000001
heavenly light so there is no real

861.36 --> 870.5600000000001
physical position to justify really

867.44 --> 873.6800000000001
right and besides

870.56 --> 874.6389999999999
i don't think that the flat earth is a

873.68 --> 877.92
disc

874.639 --> 878.8
in a literal sense i think it's more

877.92 --> 881.279
likely it's

878.8 --> 881.92
rectangular in orientation and then yeah

881.279 --> 884.48
the

881.92 --> 885.199
southern rotation point of the globe of

884.48 --> 887.519
the heavens

885.199 --> 889.68
that we see as the demi-globe yeah it

887.519 --> 892.48
will simply be

889.68 --> 894.8
in the south which would be a euclidean

892.48 --> 899.6
direction

894.8 --> 902.8
if the earth were rectangular

899.6 --> 903.36
right so i don't see the problem at all

902.8 --> 905.199
it's just

903.36 --> 906.9590000000001
you keep on bringing it up i keep

905.199 --> 908.8
explaining it over and over again it's

906.959 --> 911.68
like

908.8 --> 912.079
doesn't really matter doesn't seem to

911.68 --> 915.12
matter

912.079 --> 917.3599999999999
how many times i've explained it

915.12 --> 918.16
yes so it's just a light show that's

917.36 --> 920.5600000000001
right

918.16 --> 921.519
it's just a light show that is

920.56 --> 927.8389999999999
absolutely

921.519 --> 927.839
correct in iphone

933.14 --> 936.56
[Music]

934.56 --> 938.8389999999999
nothing apparent about it yeah it is

936.56 --> 943.199
absolutely apparent there's only

938.839 --> 943.1990000000001
appearances about it in infants

948.48 --> 955.839
light and humorous you mean

952.839 --> 955.839
pointless

1029.039 --> 1031.76
oh goody

1034.88 --> 1040.16
i think that that was the person that

1037.12 --> 1040.1599999999999
called me in the morning

1040.319 --> 1043.9189999999999
it was really weird because he spoke

1042.079 --> 1045.6
english even though with a blatantly

1043.919 --> 1046.5590000000002
dutch accent and there was a lot of

1045.6 --> 1049.84
background noise

1046.559 --> 1053.84
and it was about online trading [ __ ]

1049.84 --> 1053.84
no memory about that so whatever

1056.48 --> 1059.28
let's continue

1063.28 --> 1066.96
yeah yeah larry the march it's

1064.799 --> 1070.799
completely ridiculous

1066.96 --> 1072.799
but a flat side is gonna make a response

1070.799 --> 1076.51
video so

1072.799 --> 1078.84
we could just compare it when that comes

1076.51 --> 1081.84
[Music]

1078.84 --> 1081.84
out

1090.48 --> 1096.72
hello tv gamer

1093.679 --> 1109.8400000000001
and tiny womble

1096.72 --> 1109.84
george sanford

1120.16 --> 1124.799
flat side who the hell is that oh flat

1123.28 --> 1128.3999999999999
side is a

1124.799 --> 1129.84
a guy from south africa who also makes

1128.4 --> 1132.88
his own videos

1129.84 --> 1136.6399999999999
uh typically adds music

1132.88 --> 1137.5200000000002
let's vary his style and yeah he's also

1136.64 --> 1141.44
a regular

1137.52 --> 1141.44
panel member of the flat earth debates

1144.559 --> 1147.76
and he made a couple of really good

1146.08 --> 1149.76
videos that i like to reference because

1147.76 --> 1153.12
they're really simple and quick

1149.76 --> 1153.12
like he made plenty of

1153.919 --> 1159.8400000000001
bottom-up obstruction concealment

1157.44 --> 1161.6000000000001
demonstration videos over flats

1159.84 --> 1164.1599999999999
confirmed flat surfaces he made quite a

1161.6 --> 1167.52
lot of videos about that

1164.16 --> 1171.2
really good as a reference hello nathan

1167.52 --> 1171.2
oakley 1980 good to see you

1174.799 --> 1180.48
oh what the midnight sun in antarctica

1178.0 --> 1183.78
i don't know which midnight sun you're

1180.48 --> 1186.72
referring to i don't know anything about

1183.78 --> 1189.44
[Music]

1186.72 --> 1190.32
with certainty that is celestial

1189.44 --> 1192.88
orientation

1190.32 --> 1194.48
situations of the sun at the south pole

1192.88 --> 1197.8400000000001
or at the presumed south

1194.48 --> 1198.96
pole regions i've heard a lot of rumors

1197.84 --> 1201.84
i've seen

1198.96 --> 1202.64
camera footage faked and this was

1201.84 --> 1205.36
definitely

1202.64 --> 1206.88
faked and i've never seen a non-faked

1205.36 --> 1210.6399999999999
version of

1206.88 --> 1213.3600000000001
supposed sun rotating in a circle around

1210.64 --> 1214.5590000000002
the southern pole region that was a

1213.36 --> 1216.3999999999999
faked video from

1214.559 --> 1218.08
a lot a long time ago by the way it's

1216.4 --> 1222.5590000000002
like really from

1218.08 --> 1225.1999999999998
2015 or something and that one was faked

1222.559 --> 1227.039
right so even though this might actually

1225.2 --> 1228.799
be occurring in the north and there's a

1227.039 --> 1231.76
lot of testimony to it

1228.799 --> 1234.48
it's like he almost what is culturally

1231.76 --> 1238.0
engrained within

1234.48 --> 1240.4
the cultures that are really in the

1238.0 --> 1240.4
north

1240.799 --> 1244.24
that do get to see that sort of thing

1242.96 --> 1247.2
but it's never

1244.24 --> 1250.0
been that confirmed you could say in the

1247.2 --> 1251.76
south it's just being assumed

1250.0 --> 1255.36
that that's the same in the south never

1251.76 --> 1259.6
seen any actual evidence of it though

1255.36 --> 1261.52
right but yeah even if it was

1259.6 --> 1265.4399999999998
and i'm not saying that it is even if

1261.52 --> 1269.36
there was a 24-hour sun

1265.44 --> 1273.039
in the southern summer or something

1269.36 --> 1274.9599999999998
over at presupposed antarctica island

1273.039 --> 1277.039
and i don't think it is an island i

1274.96 --> 1280.88
think it's more like a just a

1277.039 --> 1284.4
region southern region banned southern

1280.88 --> 1287.1200000000001
southern segment of the realm

1284.4 --> 1289.52
then still yeah it's celestial lights oh

1287.12 --> 1292.559
the celestial lights are rotating

1289.52 --> 1294.48
in a very awkward way

1292.559 --> 1295.76
over there in the south okay that's

1294.48 --> 1298.88
really interesting that

1295.76 --> 1299.6
the southern light the lights are acting

1298.88 --> 1302.159
like that

1299.6 --> 1305.1999999999998
it's still just light it doesn't prove

1302.159 --> 1309.919
the earth is a ball spinning underneath

1305.2 --> 1312.32
a heliocentric situation

1309.919 --> 1312.3200000000002
all right

1315.2 --> 1318.64
well in new france if you take all those

1318.0 --> 1321.76
words

1318.64 --> 1324.72
separately and you discon you disconnect

1321.76 --> 1326.0
the context by why how they put them

1324.72 --> 1329.1200000000001
together yeah

1326.0 --> 1332.4
then sarcastically it makes sense

1329.12 --> 1333.1999999999998
right so funny sarcastic yeah yeah if

1332.4 --> 1335.8400000000001
you literally

1333.2 --> 1337.1200000000001
erase the context of the word of how i

1335.84 --> 1340.3999999999999
put the words together

1337.12 --> 1341.76
when i explain my reaction yeah then it

1340.4 --> 1344.48
makes no sense to you

1341.76 --> 1345.36
yeah that's not too difficult to imagine

1344.48 --> 1347.2
you know

1345.36 --> 1349.28
take away the context and then very

1347.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
little make sense about anything

1349.28 --> 1361.84
i know

1368.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
hello iron 26

1390.96 --> 1398.559
uh right so

1395.2 --> 1401.679
now that that is all cleared up

1398.559 --> 1403.36
about how the celestial lights acting in

1401.679 --> 1405.76
certain ways

1403.36 --> 1406.7199999999998
doesn't really prove the earth to be a

1405.76 --> 1409.919
globe

1406.72 --> 1411.2
in any sort of way maybe we can move on

1409.919 --> 1414.72
to a more

1411.2 --> 1417.44
interesting aspect of the realm that may

1414.72 --> 1421.919
conjure up doubt

1417.44 --> 1421.919
about the nature of the realm to some

1428.84 --> 1431.84
people

1443.84 --> 1449.52
yeah but uh

1447.2 --> 1450.64
again to get back into detail north real

1449.52 --> 1455.2
south fake yeah

1450.64 --> 1459.039
the north rotation thing over there

1455.2 --> 1460.24
has been recorded in unedited 24-hour

1459.039 --> 1462.96
shots

1460.24 --> 1464.799
by multiple people it's not that hard to

1462.96 --> 1466.799
get a camera

1464.799 --> 1468.1589999999999
in the northern regions where this is

1466.799 --> 1470.32
testified to happen

1468.159 --> 1471.5200000000002
it's culturally ingrained so many

1470.32 --> 1476.0
people's

1471.52 --> 1478.32
can do that and they have

1476.0 --> 1479.2
in the south however there's only just

1478.32 --> 1484.84
this

1479.2 --> 1487.6000000000001
one blatantly eddie blatantly edited

1484.84 --> 1493.1999999999998
video

1487.6 --> 1493.1999999999998
of a supposed sun rotating around

1493.52 --> 1497.84
but that one was definitely fake it's

1496.159 --> 1502.3200000000002
been

1497.84 --> 1506.24
yeah meticulously analyzed

1502.32 --> 1506.24
by a lot of flat earth people

1507.919 --> 1511.039
and hey if it was really a thing then

1510.559 --> 1513.279
why

1511.039 --> 1515.52
isn't why aren't there a lot of these

1513.279 --> 1518.24
videos

1515.52 --> 1520.72
and i mean videos that aren't blatantly

1518.24 --> 1520.72
edited

1520.799 --> 1524.48
you know untricked videos just people

1522.72 --> 1526.559
like oh yeah i'm gonna

1524.48 --> 1529.3600000000001
i'm gonna since i'm gonna be here i'm

1526.559 --> 1532.48
just gonna show the

1529.36 --> 1533.6789999999999
the 24-hour sun in there in antarctica

1532.48 --> 1536.0
that's cool

1533.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
so it shouldn't be too hard to just

1536.0 --> 1543.84
record that

1547.6 --> 1553.4399999999998
is that the one with the watch and text

1551.279 --> 1557.039
that goes behind the mountains i

1553.44 --> 1558.72
i don't remember that detail but as far

1557.039 --> 1561.919
as i know there is only

1558.72 --> 1562.559
one of these videos every time it was

1561.919 --> 1564.7990000000002
brought up

1562.559 --> 1566.6399999999999
and the video was brought forth it was

1564.799 --> 1568.8799999999999
always that video

1566.64 --> 1570.96
so i've only ever seen one of these

1568.88 --> 1574.0800000000002
supposed

1570.96 --> 1585.8400000000001
southern 24-hour sun

1574.08 --> 1585.84
videos only one ever

1588.98 --> 1592.13
[Music]

1592.159 --> 1597.8400000000001
we cut out 11 frames diddy

1595.52 --> 1600.24
no that's not the same at all tiny

1597.84 --> 1600.24
bumble

1601.2 --> 1608.32
you see that's cutting shots out of it

1604.72 --> 1611.44
the 24 hour sun video though was

1608.32 --> 1612.559
edited together as in not a few frames

1611.44 --> 1614.96
removed but just

1612.559 --> 1617.44
footage taken from an entirely different

1614.96 --> 1620.96
type of day

1617.44 --> 1623.679
and then just added it on

1620.96 --> 1627.039
right it's putting two different types

1623.679 --> 1629.76
of videos together

1627.039 --> 1631.44
at least two that's not what fletc did

1629.76 --> 1634.0
he just

1631.44 --> 1635.8400000000001
took a couple of frames out of it it's

1634.0 --> 1637.52
not the same as putting two entirely

1635.84 --> 1639.039
different footages together and then

1637.52 --> 1641.44
claiming their one

1639.039 --> 1643.919
one original video yeah it's not the

1641.44 --> 1643.919
same thing

1650.559 --> 1669.84
ah adam meekin good to see you

1654.0 --> 1669.84
changing snow on the mountain right

1676.16 --> 1679.419
[Music]

1680.84 --> 1688.009
huh

1683.66 --> 1688.009
[Music]

1701.52 --> 1709.2
a wrong impression oh well you know

1705.36 --> 1709.1999999999998
giving a wrong impression

1709.279 --> 1713.52
that's not the same thing though as

1711.12 --> 1716.32
completely falsifying the video and

1713.52 --> 1718.8799999999999
saying that it is one original

1716.32 --> 1720.32
right so it's not it's not the same

1718.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
thing though

1720.32 --> 1725.84
yeah it's not the same thing

1728.08 --> 1732.1589999999999
now in france the tiny one will claim

1730.08 --> 1736.96
that flat side

1732.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
took out frames apparently counted them

1736.96 --> 1739.8400000000001
is that important

1752.0 --> 1755.36
oh really larry the march why don't you

1753.76 --> 1758.96
share that

1755.36 --> 1758.9599999999998
because i've only ever seen one

1760.559 --> 1767.84
hello jaja light good morning

1807.12 --> 1813.52
no adam no he's just

1810.559 --> 1815.9189999999999
at humming he's just saying oh look flat

1813.52 --> 1817.12
side removed frames he's dishonest he's

1815.919 --> 1820.7990000000002
not

1817.12 --> 1822.1589999999999
currently referring to any argumentation

1820.799 --> 1826.1589999999999
he's just focusing

1822.159 --> 1828.159
on yeah on the on the man

1826.159 --> 1829.7600000000002
nitpicking about oh he removed some

1828.159 --> 1831.7600000000002
frames that makes

1829.76 --> 1833.919
him a dishonest person now that i've

1831.76 --> 1836.0
concluded that i can focus on that he's

1833.919 --> 1838.64
supposedly a dishonest person instead

1836.0 --> 1840.96
of the complete and utter lack of glow

1838.64 --> 1840.96
proof

1842.72 --> 1851.84
you know that's how it goes it's a

1845.84 --> 1851.84
familiar pattern

1853.279 --> 1856.08
oh my god

1859.44 --> 1866.3200000000002
oh god she'll cut

1862.64 --> 1869.679
out the frames that shows it's curved

1866.32 --> 1871.6789999999999
okay so i take it since

1869.679 --> 1873.2
the way you put that down in that

1871.679 --> 1875.44
sentence

1873.2 --> 1876.32
that there were some very specific

1875.44 --> 1879.919
frames

1876.32 --> 1883.039
that revealed supposedly earth curve

1879.919 --> 1883.679
visually right it's a visual so what

1883.039 --> 1886.799
about

1883.679 --> 1890.48
the other frames that weren't removed

1886.799 --> 1894.72
did did they show earth not

1890.48 --> 1894.72
being curved did they show that

1895.679 --> 1901.44
how about that so you know if there's

1898.799 --> 1904.0
frames that show the earth to be curved

1901.44 --> 1905.519
and then there's frames that show it not

1904.0 --> 1908.159
to be curved so

1905.519 --> 1909.279
how is does that make consistent sense

1908.159 --> 1914.88
shouldn't it be

1909.279 --> 1918.399
always curved the earth is a ball right

1914.88 --> 1919.2
or is it just apparently curving could

1918.399 --> 1922.799
it have

1919.2 --> 1925.3600000000001
something to do with fish eye lenses

1922.799 --> 1925.36
perhaps

1929.2 --> 1936.0
i'm asking very carefully but i already

1931.84 --> 1936.0
know this because oh my god

1946.399 --> 1950.399
okay turning my freaking phone off

1954.0 --> 1967.2
nothing to do with lenses all right

1962.08 --> 1967.1999999999998
yeah keep dreaming buddy dreaming

1967.6 --> 1973.279
yeah whenever there's high altitude

1970.88 --> 1975.8400000000001
footage

1973.279 --> 1977.919
looking out on the earth and it seems to

1975.84 --> 1981.84
be curved yeah it's fisheye lenses

1977.919 --> 1986.24
it's always fish eye lenses

1981.84 --> 1986.24
that make it look curved every single

1988.84 --> 1992.9599999999998
time

1990.88 --> 1994.96
but only from a certain angle because if

1992.96 --> 1996.88
you change that angle then suddenly the

1994.96 --> 2000.64
way

1996.88 --> 2004.159
the visual shows the earth changes so

2000.64 --> 2006.159
then it might go from curved to flat

2004.159 --> 2007.679
even to sort of hollow which makes no

2006.159 --> 2012.3200000000002
sense right

2007.679 --> 2012.3200000000002
so yeah it's definitely the fisheye lens

2015.6 --> 2021.9189999999999
it was not high altitude

2019.6 --> 2021.9189999999999
okay

2023.2 --> 2027.44
well then you're just not going to see

2024.799 --> 2028.8799999999999
curve at all

2027.44 --> 2031.519
unless you want to claim that the

2028.88 --> 2034.0800000000002
horizon is geometric

2031.519 --> 2037.039
right that the bottom up obstruction is

2034.08 --> 2038.32
due to earth curve blocking it

2037.039 --> 2040.0
if you're going to claim that then

2038.32 --> 2042.1589999999999
you've got a problem because there's

2040.0 --> 2047.44
been black swan observations and

2042.159 --> 2049.839
since physical geometry doesn't alter

2047.44 --> 2051.04
on a constant basis just by looking at

2049.839 --> 2054.0789999999997
it

2051.04 --> 2057.2
right then that

2054.079 --> 2059.2000000000003
curvature cannot be curvature that the

2057.2 --> 2061.2799999999997
one that you presume it is

2059.2 --> 2063.5989999999997
because then black swan observations

2061.28 --> 2066.3990000000003
would never be possible

2063.599 --> 2068.8
and they have they have been possible

2066.399 --> 2072.3199999999997
they are possible

2068.8 --> 2075.3590000000004
they have been filmed and thus

2072.32 --> 2077.52
yeah the idea that the earth is

2075.359 --> 2078.56
curved and that is what is blocking

2077.52 --> 2081.919
things in the distance

2078.56 --> 2081.919
is simply wrong

2082.24 --> 2086.0789999999997
because yeah the observations reveal

2085.44 --> 2088.96
that if you

2086.079 --> 2091.119
assume that it is that well the

2088.96 --> 2094.32
geometric horizon point

2091.119 --> 2097.839
would be switching would be

2094.32 --> 2101.44
moving and that's physically impossible

2097.839 --> 2103.92
with actual physical geometry

2101.44 --> 2106.7200000000003
doesn't switch it doesn't move doesn't

2103.92 --> 2109.92
move back and forth

2106.72 --> 2112.72
things on horizons

2109.92 --> 2115.44
objects that are visible in relation to

2112.72 --> 2119.52
horizons might displace a little

2115.44 --> 2122.96
but the horizon itself does not

2119.52 --> 2126.8
it does not displace vertically

2122.96 --> 2129.92
it only migrates apparently migrates

2126.8 --> 2130.88
back and forth forth into the distance

2129.92 --> 2136.16
and back

2130.88 --> 2138.8
towards you depending on your position

2136.16 --> 2141.44
how your yeah the height of the

2138.8 --> 2141.44
observation

2141.52 --> 2148.079
all that right not earth curve

2145.52 --> 2150.0
if there was earth curve in a persistent

2148.079 --> 2152.2400000000002
way then there would always be very

2150.0 --> 2155.2
persistent

2152.24 --> 2157.2799999999997
blockage due to that earth curve in a

2155.2 --> 2159.2799999999997
very consistent way and there isn't

2157.28 --> 2161.52
because there's black swan observations

2159.28 --> 2161.52
so

2162.4 --> 2168.1600000000003
yeah whether it's high altitude

2165.44 --> 2173.839
or low to the ground there's no proof

2168.16 --> 2173.839
the earth is curved

2177.92 --> 2181.44
the horizon is clearly in front of the

2180.24 --> 2186.64
rigs oh really is that

2181.44 --> 2187.52
why they the perspective shows it like

2186.64 --> 2190.4
it's

2187.52 --> 2192.32
still like the actual horizon you know

2190.4 --> 2193.04
the the point where the sky meets the

2192.32 --> 2195.599
ground is

2193.04 --> 2196.32
visually actually behind the rigs now

2195.599 --> 2199.119
you can just

2196.32 --> 2201.6800000000003
say it's in front of them if you declare

2199.119 --> 2204.6400000000003
that then you literally have no idea how

2201.68 --> 2204.64
perspective works

2207.119 --> 2210.6400000000003
you know how the horizon is even

2208.88 --> 2215.839
determined the the horizon

2210.64 --> 2215.839
is determined by the

2216.079 --> 2220.7200000000003
the crossing point the angles of

2219.68 --> 2229.839
perspective

2220.72 --> 2229.839
going towards the horizon

2236.0 --> 2239.04
so it's really cute that there's one

2238.16 --> 2241.52
shot that

2239.04 --> 2242.56
makes it seem like the horizon is in

2241.52 --> 2245.28
front of the rigs

2242.56 --> 2246.16
but yeah and the other shot it's behind

2245.28 --> 2250.48
it

2246.16 --> 2253.5989999999997
so again if the earth was a sphere

2250.48 --> 2257.52
then the curve would not seem to

2253.599 --> 2260.48
migrate the curve would be in place

2257.52 --> 2262.0
any visual alterations that might happen

2260.48 --> 2264.56
due to refraction and all that

2262.0 --> 2266.72
is just going to displace some of these

2264.56 --> 2268.7999999999997
visuals in relation to the horizon

2266.72 --> 2270.48
not the horizon itself the horizon would

2268.8 --> 2274.0
always be

2270.48 --> 2276.48
in its geometrical place

2274.0 --> 2276.48
right so

2279.119 --> 2285.839
you don't have an argument to stand on

2301.52 --> 2306.0
so what causes the horizon to move in

2304.16 --> 2309.44
front of both rigs

2306.0 --> 2309.44
two miles behind it

2310.4 --> 2315.28
well air conditions and again i've

2313.2 --> 2318.3199999999997
already told you the horizon the

2315.28 --> 2319.8390000000004
apparent horizon it's not physical

2318.32 --> 2322.6400000000003
it's apparent otherwise it wouldn't be

2319.839 --> 2325.68
migrating yeah the appearance of the

2322.64 --> 2329.04
horizon it migrates

2325.68 --> 2332.8799999999997
back and forth not up

2329.04 --> 2334.64
and down back and forth and due to

2332.88 --> 2337.359
perspective

2334.64 --> 2340.48
when it goes into the distance it seems

2337.359 --> 2342.72
to go up because that's how perspective

2340.48 --> 2344.56
will migrate its position in relation to

2342.72 --> 2348.0
the observer

2344.56 --> 2351.2
right it's perspective what comes

2348.0 --> 2353.599
towards you then it might appear

2351.2 --> 2355.4399999999996
to go down because it's drawing closer

2353.599 --> 2358.4
to you

2355.44 --> 2359.44
right because it's apparent the geometry

2358.4 --> 2363.119
does not

2359.44 --> 2365.92
shift because the geometry cannot shift

2363.119 --> 2368.96
it's only the horizon the apparent

2365.92 --> 2371.839
position where the sky meets the ground

2368.96 --> 2375.52
that can shift back and forth into the

2371.839 --> 2375.52
distance and from the distance

2376.4 --> 2383.839
towards you

2384.0 --> 2390.32
perspective was the same right but

2387.52 --> 2391.2
it doesn't really matter because the

2390.32 --> 2394.1600000000003
horizon

2391.2 --> 2395.5989999999997
it seemed to be definitely behind the

2394.16 --> 2398.48
oil rigs in

2395.599 --> 2400.2400000000002
some photos and that's the black swan

2398.48 --> 2402.0
right there

2400.24 --> 2403.7599999999998
it doesn't matter that it's not

2402.0 --> 2407.44
perfectly consistent

2403.76 --> 2408.6400000000003
to us it would only matter to you so

2407.44 --> 2411.44
you're asking

2408.64 --> 2413.68
why isn't the horizon geometrical why

2411.44 --> 2415.92
does it move back and forth

2413.68 --> 2417.7599999999998
it shouldn't do that doesn't make any

2415.92 --> 2419.28
sense so we're just going to assume

2417.76 --> 2421.119
since i've seen it once

2419.28 --> 2422.7200000000003
in the right position or where i thought

2421.119 --> 2425.04
it would have to be

2422.72 --> 2427.04
that it is geometrical well guess what

2425.04 --> 2429.7599999999998
if it was geometrical it wouldn't be

2427.04 --> 2431.7599999999998
moving back and forth it would stay in

2429.76 --> 2433.8390000000004
the same position

2431.76 --> 2438.0
in relation to the observer because

2433.839 --> 2441.839
you're looking out over a geometry

2438.0 --> 2443.76
you presume well it does

2441.839 --> 2445.92
appear to move back and forth in

2443.76 --> 2448.88
different sightings

2445.92 --> 2449.52
thus one can only conclude you're not

2448.88 --> 2452.6400000000003
looking

2449.52 --> 2454.8
over a spherical geometry because the

2452.64 --> 2458.319
horizon is moving back and forth

2454.8 --> 2458.319
depending on weather conditions

2458.56 --> 2462.0789999999997
no geometric horizon

2462.4 --> 2470.64
the horizon and any apparent

2466.0 --> 2473.68
geometries assumed is not going to abide

2470.64 --> 2475.92
by this sphere earth geometry and it

2473.68 --> 2478.839
would have to be if the earth were

2475.92 --> 2481.839
[Music]

2478.839 --> 2481.839
sphere

2496.24 --> 2509.839
all right so

2499.68 --> 2509.839
keep discussing that oh man

2535.599 --> 2541.92
oh really larry and what would seeing

2539.44 --> 2543.839
this splashdown video with flat sword

2541.92 --> 2547.119
supposed manipulation what

2543.839 --> 2549.119
would that prove the earth's curve

2547.119 --> 2551.2000000000003
or would it just be an at-home

2549.119 --> 2553.04
distraction

2551.2 --> 2554.3999999999996
from the elaborate explanations that

2553.04 --> 2557.68
i've been putting down about

2554.4 --> 2559.6800000000003
how the horizon is not geometric

2557.68 --> 2562.0789999999997
how it doesn't abide by the geometry and

2559.68 --> 2565.7599999999998
it's just apparent

2562.079 --> 2568.6400000000003
moves back and forth depending on the

2565.76 --> 2568.6400000000003
weather conditions

2576.839 --> 2579.839
right

2582.64 --> 2588.4
well turtledove keep chanting for me

2584.88 --> 2588.4
because i've already addressed this

2588.64 --> 2592.8799999999997
how can it be possible how can it be

2590.88 --> 2594.4
possible this visual that visual how can

2592.88 --> 2595.52
it be possible well because the earth is

2594.4 --> 2600.4
not a ball

2595.52 --> 2602.16
that's how yeah it's not our problem

2600.4 --> 2603.76
we're not claiming the earth is about

2602.16 --> 2606.96
you are it's your

2603.76 --> 2607.599
problem this visual issue is your

2606.96 --> 2611.28
problem

2607.599 --> 2614.1600000000003
and it's a problem you cannot solve

2611.28 --> 2616.1600000000003
because you're stuck in your imagination

2614.16 --> 2618.319
to that the earth has to be a ball

2616.16 --> 2619.7599999999998
well guess what the observations don't

2618.319 --> 2624.88
me don't actually

2619.76 --> 2628.0
meet the requirements

2624.88 --> 2628.0
of what you presume

2631.44 --> 2636.319
do i feel the ballers have the burden of

2633.599 --> 2637.599
proof oh my god yes they do

2636.319 --> 2640.24
they're the ones that have a very

2637.599 --> 2643.3590000000004
specific claim

2640.24 --> 2645.68
very specifically

2643.359 --> 2645.68
right

2646.96 --> 2651.28
flat earthers don't have that much of an

2649.599 --> 2653.6800000000003
elaborate claim they just claim the

2651.28 --> 2656.88
earth is flat

2653.68 --> 2660.16
and that the earth is not a ball it's

2656.88 --> 2660.1600000000003
very simple claims

2660.839 --> 2666.0789999999997
yet not that

2663.28 --> 2666.079
hard to prove

2668.16 --> 2673.1189999999997
because yeah a flat surface is the only

2671.44 --> 2677.52
thing really

2673.119 --> 2680.56
in which an apparent horizon can

2677.52 --> 2684.16
move back and forth as dramatically as

2680.56 --> 2685.52
has been observed that can only happen

2684.16 --> 2688.64
on a flat plane

2685.52 --> 2689.7599999999998
it can never happen on a sphere never

2688.64 --> 2693.7599999999998
happen on a hill

2689.76 --> 2694.6400000000003
no matter how big the horizon doesn't

2693.76 --> 2698.0
really move

2694.64 --> 2701.92
back and forth on a on any kind of

2698.0 --> 2703.839
spherical nature geometry of any sort

2701.92 --> 2704.96
doesn't move back and forth because the

2703.839 --> 2707.92
geometry

2704.96 --> 2710.079
keeps the horizon pretty persistent in

2707.92 --> 2712.7200000000003
the same spot

2710.079 --> 2714.7200000000003
on a flat plane however where the

2712.72 --> 2715.9199999999996
horizon is visible is much more

2714.72 --> 2719.359
dependent

2715.92 --> 2722.079
on the weather quality

2719.359 --> 2723.92
what are you looking for through and if

2722.079 --> 2724.6400000000003
it is very clear then you will just be

2723.92 --> 2727.599
able to see

2724.64 --> 2728.96
very far effectively moving the apparent

2727.599 --> 2733.839
horizon

2728.96 --> 2733.839
farther into the distance

2734.16 --> 2740.96
that only happens on a flat plane

2737.76 --> 2743.28
although maybe in a concave system

2740.96 --> 2745.68
something similar could also happen but

2743.28 --> 2749.0400000000004
just uh

2745.68 --> 2752.3999999999996
yeah the natural consequences of being

2749.04 --> 2754.96
inside of a sort of spherical geometry

2752.4 --> 2755.44
and just yeah there would oh you would

2754.96 --> 2758.0
never

2755.44 --> 2761.04
have a just a sky to look at you would

2758.0 --> 2764.4
always be looking at part

2761.04 --> 2767.68
of the earth diagonally

2764.4 --> 2770.8
top down because it's

2767.68 --> 2772.839
into the distance up there and you would

2770.8 --> 2775.8390000000004
always see

2772.839 --> 2777.839
something

2775.839 --> 2779.599
you would always have some point where

2777.839 --> 2782.48
you would be looking basically

2779.599 --> 2784.56
on the top of buildings from the horizon

2782.48 --> 2787.04
because it is supposedly geometrically

2784.56 --> 2790.48
concave

2787.04 --> 2794.24
if you presuppose that it could be right

2790.48 --> 2796.64
but flat flat earth flat geometry is

2794.24 --> 2796.64
very

2797.52 --> 2804.24
very easy to assume

2801.2 --> 2807.839
because of the horizon visuals because

2804.24 --> 2812.319
it does appear to migrate

2807.839 --> 2812.319
the apparent horizon point as much as it

2814.839 --> 2818.88
does

2817.04 --> 2821.599
of course all right no no no no the

2818.88 --> 2824.56
horizon doesn't move

2821.599 --> 2825.92
with refraction refraction can't

2824.56 --> 2828.96
displace

2825.92 --> 2831.76
the horizon in relation

2828.96 --> 2834.64
to the horizon there is no vertical

2831.76 --> 2834.6400000000003
displacement

2834.8 --> 2841.52
of the horizon there is only

2838.16 --> 2845.2799999999997
a moving into the distance

2841.52 --> 2846.4
and closer by of the apparent horizon

2845.28 --> 2849.599
point

2846.4 --> 2852.1600000000003
visually can seem to move

2849.599 --> 2855.119
closer by and can seem to move further

2852.16 --> 2859.839
away depending on the weather conditions

2855.119 --> 2859.839
it's not up or down

2863.04 --> 2873.839
it's into the distance and closer by

2879.2 --> 2887.839
hello dr sailor

2904.72 --> 2909.68
yeah flatman they use occam's razors to

2907.44 --> 2909.68
uh

2911.119 --> 2916.8
to lobotomize themselves i think

2915.04 --> 2919.92
they're they're not using it for what

2916.8 --> 2919.92
it's supposed to be used

2925.839 --> 2929.7599999999998
yeah dutch sailor i'm doing okay i'm a

2928.24 --> 2933.2799999999997
little bit tense

2929.76 --> 2936.0
due to some yeah living situation

2933.28 --> 2938.48
issues but other than that i'm doing

2936.0 --> 2938.48
pretty good

2939.76 --> 2943.8390000000004
i survived the middle of the month

2944.4 --> 2954.0
financially and yeah

2949.04 --> 2957.839
looking forward to well the next month

2954.0 --> 2960.72
should be another week and then

2957.839 --> 2962.64
yeah it will be revealed to me whether

2960.72 --> 2965.52
my crypto situation is really going to

2962.64 --> 2965.52
pay off or not

2966.16 --> 2970.0
so i'm a little bit tense about that

2968.559 --> 2973.28
same time my landlord

2970.0 --> 2978.88
is harassing me again with

2973.28 --> 2980.96
a lawyer that makes me a little nervous

2978.88 --> 2982.8
although i have confidence that yeah

2980.96 --> 2984.319
nothing has really changed since last

2982.8 --> 2985.8390000000004
time it's not the first time he tried

2984.319 --> 2988.16
this

2985.839 --> 2989.52
and last time yeah without success it

2988.16 --> 2994.319
was just a bluff so i'm

2989.52 --> 2994.319
presuming he's just doing it again

2996.319 --> 3002.72
and i i really don't care to even

3000.16 --> 3004.83
think about the motivations behind it i

3002.72 --> 3008.06
really don't care

3004.83 --> 3008.06
[Music]

3011.28 --> 3016.7200000000003
i've yeah i've been considered

3014.319 --> 3018.16
considering like at some point i could

3016.72 --> 3022.319
try to counter sue him

3018.16 --> 3022.319
for yeah for literal harassment

3023.359 --> 3027.839
and slandering

3027.92 --> 3031.6800000000003
but i don't know it might never have to

3030.96 --> 3035.28
get to that

3031.68 --> 3035.2799999999997
as long as i can just live here

3036.079 --> 3041.8390000000004

3210.079 --> 3218.4
certain type of party this was

a decade ago now god our time has flown

3218.4 --> 3223.839
it's crazy

3227.44 --> 3230.559
but anyway i yeah i really appreciate

3230.16 --> 3236.64
that

3230.559 --> 3240.0
dutch sailor

3236.64 --> 3243.52
also i'd like to let people know that i

3240.0 --> 3246.0
am technically looking although i don't

3243.52 --> 3246.0
know yet

3246.319 --> 3252.8
exactly what lb look oh damn it

3249.359 --> 3252.7999999999997
what i'll be looking for but

3253.28 --> 3257.3590000000004
yeah i might be looking for a better

3255.599 --> 3260.4
home for myself

3257.359 --> 3262.88
even you know

3260.4 --> 3265.2000000000003
after well after the the krypto

3262.88 --> 3269.599
situation has revealed to me just

3265.2 --> 3272.16
how much i can muster after that point

3269.599 --> 3273.2000000000003
so i am kind of looking for it doesn't

3272.16 --> 3276.64
have to be big

3273.2 --> 3279.04
a modest house or a floor

3276.64 --> 3280.64
and i would really prefer if there was

3279.04 --> 3284.079
like garden room

3280.64 --> 3286.4
like that one is really important no one

3284.079 --> 3294.48
pays rent at your place

3286.4 --> 3296.7200000000003
okay okay dutch sailor if you say so

3294.48 --> 3297.839
how's the dating scene working out for

3296.72 --> 3301.2
me

3297.839 --> 3302.64
what dating scene i'm not really engaged

3301.2 --> 3306.16
in any dating scene

3302.64 --> 3310.5589999999997
i am however just looking out

3306.16 --> 3310.5589999999997
a lot just to see what's there

3311.28 --> 3315.2000000000003
if there's still enough cute girls out

3313.359 --> 3316.88
there and there are

3315.2 --> 3318.96
and i'm also trying to figure out

3316.88 --> 3321.359
exactly what i find attractive about

3318.96 --> 3324.2400000000002
girls again

3321.359 --> 3324.24
not that i have

3326.24 --> 3332.8799999999997
okay that came out wrong it's just that

3330.96 --> 3334.88
i've always found a girl's attractive

3332.88 --> 3335.92
it's just like what am i actually

3334.88 --> 3339.599
looking for

3335.92 --> 3342.799
character-wise spirit-wise in a woman

3339.599 --> 3348.6400000000003
because my objectives before

3342.799 --> 3350.96
were never really aimed at

3348.64 --> 3351.68
anything beyond just kind of sexual

3350.96 --> 3355.359
relations

3351.68 --> 3358.799
too much like i wanted kids but i never

3355.359 --> 3362.16
really realized that that also kind of

3358.799 --> 3366.4
takes another type of person

3362.16 --> 3370.24
to engage so i like the curvy bits

3366.4 --> 3370.2400000000002
yeah curvature on women is great

3371.2 --> 3377.839
that's why i like my curves too

3390.079 --> 3394.48
but yeah i'm not really engaging i'm

3392.72 --> 3396.24
just keeping an eye out and trying to

3394.48 --> 3399.28
see like

3396.24 --> 3400.4799999999996
do girls find me attractive just on the

3399.28 --> 3402.1600000000003
surface

3400.48 --> 3405.839
and then i'm trying to figure out okay

3402.16 --> 3405.839
how do i actually engage them

3407.04 --> 3410.72
because that part is a little bit more

3408.96 --> 3413.76
trouble to me

3410.72 --> 3415.4399999999996
i really know how to engage into basic

3413.76 --> 3419.2000000000003
small talk

3415.44 --> 3422.48
but to actually move it beyond that

3419.2 --> 3424.72
i often just wonder inside of my mind

3422.48 --> 3424.72
like

3426.0 --> 3434.24
what would i even be doing like

3430.0 --> 3437.839
besides sex presumably like

3434.24 --> 3437.839
i kind of forgot what it's like

3438.4 --> 3443.04
probably i with my ex i watched a lot of

3442.319 --> 3447.839
movies

3443.04 --> 3447.839
and played video games even

3447.92 --> 3451.839
and then eventually we had a lot of

3449.92 --> 3454.2400000000002
shared interests

3451.839 --> 3455.04
that we wanted to develop outside of

3454.24 --> 3456.9599999999996
that

3455.04 --> 3459.44
because video games and movies isn't

3456.96 --> 3462.7200000000003
exactly a stable

3459.44 --> 3466.559
long-term relationship foundation right

3462.72 --> 3466.5589999999997
so we had both interest in gardening

3466.64 --> 3475.44
and in health and food and that

3470.88 --> 3479.2000000000003
worked out really well until

3475.44 --> 3479.2000000000003
yeah until it didn't anymore

3485.44 --> 3488.48
but if i'm going to be looking out for a

3488.079 --> 3490.48
girl

3488.48 --> 3493.2
i think it's going to have to be one

3490.48 --> 3496.64
that is going to accept

3493.2 --> 3497.9199999999996
that i have a kind of a ragey side to me

3496.64 --> 3500.319
as well

3497.92 --> 3503.28
and that they're not just going to spend

3500.319 --> 3506.16
all their focus on trying to erase that

3503.28 --> 3508.1600000000003
aspect about me in some way

3506.16 --> 3509.2
because that would hurt because yes i

3508.16 --> 3511.839
can

3509.2 --> 3513.68
suppress that element and make basically

3511.839 --> 3516.0
make it look like that doesn't even

3513.68 --> 3519.5989999999997
that it's even not even a part of me can

3516.0 --> 3519.599
do that for a pretty long time

3519.92 --> 3524.799
but eventually it will come leaking out

3522.88 --> 3527.52
especially in situations where i get

3524.799 --> 3527.52
demoralized

3529.599 --> 3533.28
does my future wife need to be a flat

3531.76 --> 3536.1600000000003
earther

3533.28 --> 3536.48
not necessarily but if they're going to

3536.16 --> 3538.799
be

3536.48 --> 3539.52
like a really fanatical glober that's

3538.799 --> 3542.0
going to be

3539.52 --> 3543.7599999999998
just impossible then because they'll get

3542.0 --> 3547.2
in my way

3543.76 --> 3549.28
unless unless

3547.2 --> 3551.04
but i i don't even want to do that

3549.28 --> 3552.96
because then we'll be stuck

3551.04 --> 3554.72
back and forth the rest of my life but

3552.96 --> 3555.76
if she'd might be a globe where there

3554.72 --> 3557.4399999999996
would be like

3555.76 --> 3560.1600000000003
no i'm okay with you being a flat

3557.44 --> 3563.92
earther let's just

3560.16 --> 3566.16
debate like that that would be weird

3563.92 --> 3567.6800000000003
never even thought i don't even think

3566.16 --> 3568.5589999999997
there are women like that out there but

3567.68 --> 3570.48
who knows

3568.559 --> 3573.8390000000004
like women that i'd find interactive i

3570.48 --> 3573.839
don't know

3574.319 --> 3580.96
but yeah it's been on my mind also

3577.76 --> 3583.119
due to spring which typically does

3580.96 --> 3584.88
put that sort of thing on my mind a lot

3583.119 --> 3588.799
like women women women

3584.88 --> 3592.079
what type of women do they find me cute

3588.799 --> 3592.88
does it even matter what is it that'll

3592.079 --> 3595.92
make them

3592.88 --> 3599.92
really hold on

3595.92 --> 3600.96
that part is more important to me

3599.92 --> 3604.4
because

3600.96 --> 3605.44
sounds maybe a little gross but i think

3604.4 --> 3608.1600000000003
technically i

3605.44 --> 3609.359
could like if i literally didn't give a

3608.16 --> 3611.7599999999998
[ __ ] anymore

3609.359 --> 3613.04
i could probably get sex with plenty of

3611.76 --> 3616.559
women

3613.04 --> 3617.119
i just don't really care it makes me

3616.559 --> 3621.3590000000004
feel

3617.119 --> 3624.7200000000003
bad i'll end up

3621.359 --> 3627.52
just manipulating and disregarding

3624.72 --> 3628.24
feelings and all that and i don't want

3627.52 --> 3630.24
that i

3628.24 --> 3643.839
really dislike doing that it makes me

3630.24 --> 3643.839
feel really shitty about myself

3644.72 --> 3647.04
all right

3648.799 --> 3653.7599999999998
right so anyway that's

3655.359 --> 3659.7599999999998
that's concerned my dating situation

3658.16 --> 3661.7599999999998
that i don't really have any

3659.76 --> 3665.0400000000004
but i am keeping a look at and i still

3661.76 --> 3669.119
do still think that i am

3665.04 --> 3671.44
at least appealing

3669.119 --> 3674.079
to a whole range of women of all kinds

3671.44 --> 3674.079
of ages

3674.64 --> 3681.68
it's just i realized that yeah but what

3677.92 --> 3681.6800000000003
about if they get to know me

3682.24 --> 3688.0789999999997
not because i'm a flat earther mind you

3685.04 --> 3690.24
but just because i'm me

3688.079 --> 3693.76
and i'm sensitive and i have a lot of

3690.24 --> 3693.7599999999998
strong feelings and yeah

3695.599 --> 3699.839
there's certain type of women that are

3697.44 --> 3701.359
into that

3699.839 --> 3703.2799999999997
and there's plenty of women that are

3701.359 --> 3706.16
absolutely not into that

3703.28 --> 3706.1600000000003
quite the opposite

3706.72 --> 3712.8799999999997
also women that do typically get into

3709.2 --> 3713.5989999999997
that also have a tendency to latch onto

3712.88 --> 3717.119
kind of

3713.599 --> 3717.119
bad men

3717.52 --> 3721.2
that are like that have the same traits

3720.0 --> 3723.839
but usually

3721.2 --> 3725.68
don't have it under control and make a

3723.839 --> 3729.0389999999998
whole lot of hassle

3725.68 --> 3731.9199999999996
and yeah my friend is

3729.039 --> 3732.3190000000004
typically one of those women but i can

3731.92 --> 3735.76
i'm

3732.319 --> 3737.839
really good with her like sometimes i

3735.76 --> 3738.7990000000004
almost feel like i'm her husband or

3737.839 --> 3741.359
something but

3738.799 --> 3741.92
keeping my distance because we just

3741.359 --> 3744.24
connect

3741.92 --> 3745.119
really well i get her really well she

3744.24 --> 3747.359
gets me

3745.119 --> 3748.559
really well she knows exactly what to

3747.359 --> 3751.839
say

3748.559 --> 3753.92
and she does do it

3751.839 --> 3756.16
right so there should be more women out

3753.92 --> 3756.16
there

3759.44 --> 3761.92
like that

3763.2 --> 3766.72
because in a way if i'm gonna have a

3765.28 --> 3768.6400000000003
serious relationship

3766.72 --> 3770.8799999999997
it's going to be with somebody that will

3768.64 --> 3773.2799999999997
accept that it's basically us against

3770.88 --> 3773.28
the world

3773.52 --> 3776.24
effectively

3776.64 --> 3784.48
and if they don't have that like

3780.559 --> 3784.48
that sense of loyalty then

3784.96 --> 3788.96
i will not really connect with them as

3794.839 --> 3797.839
deeply

3800.96 --> 3807.119
because yeah then they might also be

3804.079 --> 3810.6400000000003
very easily peer pressured into taking a

3807.119 --> 3813.119
position against me

3810.64 --> 3814.16
this also by the way happened with my ex

3813.119 --> 3816.6400000000003
like she got

3814.16 --> 3817.68
basically peer pressured by your friends

3816.64 --> 3821.52
to take certain

3817.68 --> 3823.7599999999998
stances against me despite

3821.52 --> 3825.119
the the arguments and the proof that i

3823.76 --> 3826.7200000000003
delivered

3825.119 --> 3829.2000000000003
i'm not going to get specific about the

3826.72 --> 3829.2
subject

3832.559 --> 3838.559
right and that was a really bad

3834.64 --> 3841.92
situation back then

3838.559 --> 3841.92
that was very stressful

3845.039 --> 3849.039
but yeah let's move on to flat earth

3850.839 --> 3853.839
again

3861.28 --> 3867.92
we don't see far enough for a flat earth

3864.4 --> 3868.48
oh really you would have to see a

3867.92 --> 3871.76
certain

3868.48 --> 3873.359
distance on a flat earth would you

3871.76 --> 3874.88
you would have to always see that

3873.359 --> 3877.839
distance do you

3874.88 --> 3878.4
how about on the ball it sounds like

3877.839 --> 3880.24
you're

3878.4 --> 3882.1600000000003
reversing the entire situation because

3880.24 --> 3885.2799999999997
i'm pretty sure it's the opposite

3882.16 --> 3886.0
on a flat earth you can see very far at

3885.28 --> 3887.599
times

3886.0 --> 3890.16
but not always because of the weather

3887.599 --> 3895.28
conditions on a ball however

3890.16 --> 3899.0389999999998
you would never see extremely far

3895.28 --> 3902.48
because it would always be blocked from

3899.039 --> 3904.7990000000004
side right

3902.48 --> 3908.2400000000002
you don't always have to see far on a

3904.799 --> 3911.92
flat earth

3908.24 --> 3913.68
sight still has limits a refraction you

3911.92 --> 3914.559
say what type of refraction would that

3913.68 --> 3917.2
be

3914.559 --> 3918.2400000000002
would that be terrestrial science

3917.2 --> 3921.359
fiction

3918.24 --> 3922.0789999999997
refraction that suggests that the

3921.359 --> 3925.0389999999998
horizon

3922.079 --> 3926.799
itself can be vertically displaced in

3925.039 --> 3927.6800000000003
relation to the horizon and it's a

3926.799 --> 3931.7599999999998
paradox

3927.68 --> 3931.7599999999998
that refraction larry the march

3934.839 --> 3942.4
hmm ah by the way thank you jd

3939.44 --> 3942.4
i appreciate that

3945.28 --> 3950.2400000000002
yeah i know right flat man it's just

3948.48 --> 3952.2400000000002
you you bring out all these points and

3950.24 --> 3955.52
they just throw out

3952.24 --> 3958.3999999999996
prefab words that are all

3955.52 --> 3960.24
they're like they're just presenting one

3958.4 --> 3961.2000000000003
can of worms after the other and it's

3960.24 --> 3964.0789999999997
just making us

3961.2 --> 3964.799
open the can of worms they're can of

3964.079 --> 3966.4
worms

3964.799 --> 3968.64
they're just like presenting the can of

3966.4 --> 3969.6800000000003
worms like this is the ultimate solution

3968.64 --> 3971.5989999999997
and that's just like

3969.68 --> 3973.68
okay now let's take the lid off that oh

3971.599 --> 3975.6800000000003
you got a can of worms yeah i know let's

3973.68 --> 3978.8799999999997
move on to the next

3975.68 --> 3982.0
little thing you thought on a very very

3978.88 --> 3983.76
very short run was a solution to the

3982.0 --> 3985.76
problems you were being faced with

3983.76 --> 3987.44
but they weren't they're just the next

3985.76 --> 3989.44
subject that is

3987.44 --> 3990.799
similarly going to be completely

3989.44 --> 3994.0
dismantled

3990.799 --> 3995.359
because you don't have any arguments for

3994.0 --> 3998.559
the ball earth

3995.359 --> 4001.839
okay you don't have any nothing you have

3998.559 --> 4004.1600000000003
nothing there is no actual arguments

4001.839 --> 4005.68
for the globe earth there aren't any

4004.16 --> 4008.72
only broken

4005.68 --> 4010.5589999999997
logic just one can of worms after the

4008.72 --> 4013.5989999999997
other and you're constantly

4010.559 --> 4017.28
making us open the can of worms for you

4013.599 --> 4020.6400000000003
to show you there's worms in it

4017.28 --> 4022.96
every single day you're doing that [ __ ]

4020.64 --> 4025.1189999999997
every single day the ballers do this

4022.96 --> 4027.44
just one can of worms after all and

4025.119 --> 4029.28
every time okay let's get open this kind

4027.44 --> 4029.76
of worms again yeah there's worms in it

4029.28 --> 4031.92
yeah

4029.76 --> 4034.0
we knew that because we've been opening

4031.92 --> 4037.039
these cans of worms for you

4034.0 --> 4039.44
for years now we know

4037.039 --> 4042.079
your arguments are cans of worms every

4039.44 --> 4042.079
single time

4046.88 --> 4051.2000000000003
i just keep fantasizing dr gonzo you

4049.359 --> 4054.799
don't have anything

4051.2 --> 4056.0789999999997
nothing just a sheer you have a lot of

4054.799 --> 4058.48
empty boxes

4056.079 --> 4060.48
you have an entire warehouse full of

4058.48 --> 4062.799
empty boxes

4060.48 --> 4076.319
and you got your cans of worms to

4062.799 --> 4079.68
represent them

4076.319 --> 4080.24
with no atmosphere or oh when is that

4079.68 --> 4082.5589999999997
happening

4080.24 --> 4084.3999999999996
exactly larry the march when did that

4082.559 --> 4087.8390000000004
ever happen did that ever happen

4084.4 --> 4091.119
or are you just saying look if the world

4087.839 --> 4094.319
wasn't the way it actually is

4091.119 --> 4096.159000000001
then we might be seeing that the earth

4094.319 --> 4099.12
might be a globe if it was

4096.159 --> 4099.679
well guess what there is no earth

4099.12 --> 4103.679
without

4099.679 --> 4107.04
the air right the atmos in it

4103.679 --> 4109.12
it will always be filled with atmos

4107.04 --> 4110.239
because nothing is going to really allow

4109.12 --> 4111.759
it to go away

4110.239 --> 4114.799
because it's contained within the

4111.759 --> 4118.159
container of the realm

4114.799 --> 4120.56
physical container a barrier not some

4118.159 --> 4121.3589999999995
presupposed force that's actually not a

4120.56 --> 4123.120000000001
force

4121.359 --> 4124.96
that even if you thought it was a force

4123.12 --> 4127.44
wouldn't be strong enough

4124.96 --> 4128.08
to keep the gas pressure from expanding

4127.44 --> 4132.08
within an

4128.08 --> 4134.48
infinite volume outer space universe

4132.08 --> 4135.44
right which would give it infinite

4134.48 --> 4138.08
expansion

4135.44 --> 4139.44
strength yeah and even if you presuppose

4138.08 --> 4141.92
gravity was a force

4139.44 --> 4144.08
to hold that back it's not strong enough

4141.92 --> 4147.12
by your own presuppositional

4144.08 --> 4149.12
calculation system yeah

4147.12 --> 4151.599999999999
how many freaking times do i have to

4149.12 --> 4152.239
shove that [ __ ] in your face it's your

4151.6 --> 4155.759
[ __ ]

4152.239 --> 4158.159
okay it's not my [ __ ] this is your

4155.759 --> 4158.159
[ __ ]

4159.679 --> 4163.759
yeah your presuppositional system

4162.56 --> 4167.120000000001
doesn't work it's not

4163.759 --> 4175.839
mine i just figured out how yours

4167.12 --> 4175.839
doesn't work and then point it out yeah

4181.759 --> 4185.92
does this make you happy it depends on

4185.44 --> 4189.5199999999995
how

4185.92 --> 4191.04
miserable it makes you because doing

4189.52 --> 4195.1990000000005
this on a constant rate

4191.04 --> 4197.28
literally dealing with denialist retards

4195.199 --> 4199.44
that think they're smart because the

4197.28 --> 4202.239
entire world is indoctrinated with the

4199.44 --> 4204.4
same [ __ ] [ __ ]

4202.239 --> 4206.08
it doesn't always make me happy

4204.4 --> 4209.36
confronting you with it

4206.08 --> 4210.08
but it has to be done because you need

4209.36 --> 4213.5199999999995
to be

4210.08 --> 4217.36
torturously reminded that you're living

4213.52 --> 4221.120000000001
a lie constantly

4217.36 --> 4224.4
i need to do that because otherwise

4221.12 --> 4227.5199999999995
i just blabber this nonsense

4224.4 --> 4230.799999999999
to no end and everybody will become

4227.52 --> 4235.6
even more [ __ ] than they already

4230.8 --> 4245.39
are yeah so i have to confront you

4235.6 --> 4248.589
with natural consequences reality

4245.39 --> 4248.589
[Music]

4254.76 --> 4261.6
[Music]

4257.76 --> 4261.6
yeah yeah keep squirting for me

4261.92 --> 4265.1990000000005
i know reality sucks right because

4264.48 --> 4268.32
reality

4265.199 --> 4268.96
is not your stupid belief and you want

4268.32 --> 4272.0
to live

4268.96 --> 4274.4
in your stupid belief that's not real

4272.0 --> 4276.239
yeah it's stupid it's stupid for

4274.4 --> 4278.639999999999
something that can never be real

4276.239 --> 4280.879999999999
never was real never will be real to

4278.64 --> 4282.719
keep believing in that and holding on to

4280.88 --> 4283.6
it just because others are telling you

4282.719 --> 4286.56
it's okay

4283.6 --> 4288.719
you know what that is it's stupid it's

4286.56 --> 4291.84
not productive it's literally

4288.719 --> 4294.88
a delusion cage

4291.84 --> 4301.84
that prevents you from

4294.88 --> 4301.84
developing that's what it is

4303.58 --> 4306.689
[Music]

4318.239 --> 4324.879999999999
do i only date flat earth women

4321.52 --> 4325.84
no but i'm ready to convert women to

4324.88 --> 4329.84
flat earth

4325.84 --> 4329.84
i will every single time

4331.6 --> 4337.4400000000005
like again women that i would date

4335.28 --> 4339.679
they would not have to believe flat

4337.44 --> 4343.5199999999995
earth but they would have to

4339.679 --> 4345.12
deal with me dealing with it

4343.52 --> 4346.56
and they would have to do so

4345.12 --> 4349.44
respectfully

4346.56 --> 4349.76
and if there would be acting this i

4349.44 --> 4352.5599999999995
would

4349.76 --> 4352.56
figure it out

4353.199 --> 4356.48
and confront it and then probably just

4355.44 --> 4359.678999999999
say okay

4356.48 --> 4359.678999999999
i'm done with this [ __ ]

4362.56 --> 4365.92
i'm not gonna date somebody that doesn't

4364.64 --> 4368.96
actually take my

4365.92 --> 4370.719
well part of my life work seriously my

4368.96 --> 4374.64
life's work

4370.719 --> 4376.2390000000005
intellectual my intellectual heritage

4374.64 --> 4379.76
thing that i've been developing and

4376.239 --> 4379.759999999999
building for so long

4380.8 --> 4385.84
if a woman can't take that serious well

4382.719 --> 4389.679
then i don't really give a [ __ ]

4385.84 --> 4392.2390000000005
about her as well not that they would

4389.679 --> 4392.96
have to constantly be enthusiastic about

4392.239 --> 4396.799999999999
it they would

4392.96 --> 4400.159
just have to respect it and respect me

4396.8 --> 4400.159000000001
properly for it

4401.36 --> 4406.88
as i would respect whatever they're

4404.159 --> 4409.36
trying to achieve in their life

4406.88 --> 4411.36
some of their goals some of their dreams

4409.36 --> 4414.159
i will try to help them

4411.36 --> 4415.44
navigate through those dreams with what

4414.159 --> 4418.159
i know

4415.44 --> 4418.639999999999
and i would hope that they that she

4418.159 --> 4427.839999999999
would

4418.64 --> 4427.84
hopefully kind of do the same you know

4433.199 --> 4436.5599999999995
don't call her a [ __ ] if she's not a

4434.96 --> 4440.159
flat earther

4436.56 --> 4444.56
well yeah i will i will absolutely

4440.159 --> 4444.5599999999995
will to her face yeah

4444.719 --> 4451.199
i have no problem humiliating women

4447.84 --> 4452.64
for their stupidity and if she can't

4451.199 --> 4454.799999999999
handle this she's going to be all super

4452.64 --> 4456.8
triggered and then just

4454.8 --> 4459.84
talk [ __ ] then it's fine then i don't

4456.8 --> 4461.92
ever have to see her again

4459.84 --> 4463.1990000000005
if somebody's gonna be stupid to me i

4461.92 --> 4466.2390000000005
will

4463.199 --> 4468.639999999999
i will break it to them

4466.239 --> 4470.718999999999
yeah if they're gonna get to that point

4468.64 --> 4472.719
i probably won't find them all that

4470.719 --> 4476.08
attractive anyway

4472.719 --> 4478.8
because i really don't like people

4476.08 --> 4479.28
that give in to stupidity and then try

4478.8 --> 4482.08
to

4479.28 --> 4483.04
defend that stupidity through peer

4482.08 --> 4486.32
pressure

4483.04 --> 4489.5199999999995
right i hate nothing in this world

4486.32 --> 4490.88
more than peer pressure to defend

4489.52 --> 4494.080000000001
stupidity i

4490.88 --> 4497.36
hate it i despise

4494.08 --> 4500.159
that i despise it

4497.36 --> 4501.5199999999995
yeah so if somebody's gonna do that i

4500.159 --> 4502.879999999999
don't really even care if they're a

4501.52 --> 4506.400000000001
woman

4502.88 --> 4508.32
or a man whatever they're gonna do that

4506.4 --> 4509.679
i don't want to have anything to do with

4508.32 --> 4511.84
them at

4509.679 --> 4511.84
all

4525.44 --> 4530.879999999999
i'd rather be single and lady

4528.48 --> 4532.48
that wants me to become an i don't think

4530.88 --> 4539.84
there's any of those though

4532.48 --> 4539.839999999999
dutch sailors

4545.28 --> 4549.28
and you know i've considered some silly

4547.52 --> 4550.080000000001
things that are never going to happen

4549.28 --> 4553.04
probably

4550.08 --> 4553.92
very unlikely to ever happen but i've

4553.04 --> 4556.56
even thought of

4553.92 --> 4558.96
that i wouldn't mind actually being an

4556.56 --> 4562.080000000001
astronaut actor

4558.96 --> 4565.36
if besides the on duty act

4562.08 --> 4567.199
i could be honest about what i really

4565.36 --> 4569.32
believe

4567.199 --> 4570.799999999999
you know and then they would have to

4569.32 --> 4572.639999999999
compartmentalize it

4570.8 --> 4574.0
it's like oh this is the astronaut and

4572.64 --> 4576.8
then just

4574.0 --> 4577.679
don't connect the flat earth to that and

4576.8 --> 4580.320000000001
i wouldn't be

4577.679 --> 4580.8
if i was actually astronaut acting i

4580.32 --> 4584.48
wouldn't

4580.8 --> 4587.6
bring that [ __ ] up unless they

4584.48 --> 4590.879999999999
demanded that i put some kind of secret

4587.6 --> 4593.1990000000005
flat earth thingy in it

4590.88 --> 4595.76
because they might just do that i don't

4593.199 --> 4599.599999999999
know exactly

4595.76 --> 4602.0
what drives the astronaut

4599.6 --> 4603.52
program as it were what drives what they

4602.0 --> 4607.04
socially do exactly

4603.52 --> 4607.040000000001
so they if i'd be

4607.199 --> 4611.759999999999
invited as an asteroid and they would

4609.28 --> 4614.96
contractually allow me to just be a flat

4611.76 --> 4614.96
earther beside that

4615.679 --> 4620.2390000000005
that would be pretty amazing i don't

4617.36 --> 4622.5599999999995
think they ever will

4620.239 --> 4624.639999999999
but if that were the case then during

4622.56 --> 4626.320000000001
the act i'm not just gonna oh it's flat

4624.64 --> 4628.8
smack people while i am

4626.32 --> 4630.239
acting like i'm floating in in the space

4628.8 --> 4634.4800000000005
station or something

4630.239 --> 4634.48
right that that's ridiculous

4634.56 --> 4638.0
so technically i wouldn't even mind

4636.88 --> 4641.52
doing these things

4638.0 --> 4641.92
as long as i don't have to act it's all

4641.52 --> 4644.080000000001
real

4641.92 --> 4645.1990000000005
the rest of my freaking life under some

4644.08 --> 4647.84
threat

4645.199 --> 4648.239
right that's the part i don't like i

4647.84 --> 4651.76
don't

4648.239 --> 4655.678999999999
mind playing astronaut

4651.76 --> 4658.64
as long as it will not force me

4655.679 --> 4660.08
to lie and be suppressed the rest of my

4658.64 --> 4665.84
freaking life about it

4660.08 --> 4665.84
right that's the part i don't want

4684.64 --> 4688.0
right is that really weird then i'm

4686.159 --> 4690.48
saying that

4688.0 --> 4692.64
as a flat earther i i really wouldn't

4690.48 --> 4694.159
mind playing an astronaut as long as i

4692.64 --> 4696.400000000001
don't

4694.159 --> 4698.159
as long as i still can have this sort of

4696.4 --> 4701.199
a life outside of that

4698.159 --> 4702.0
even with a public face maybe a show and

4701.199 --> 4705.36
not

4702.0 --> 4708.56
have to certainly pretend it's all real

4705.36 --> 4709.28
outside of the act itself because that

4708.56 --> 4712.080000000001
would be like

4709.28 --> 4714.48
if it were a hollywood actor and i would

4712.08 --> 4716.239
get a movie role and then henceforth i

4714.48 --> 4719.12
would have to

4716.239 --> 4720.08
pretend like the movie role was real for

4719.12 --> 4723.84
the rest of my life

4720.08 --> 4723.84
that would be [ __ ] up guys

4729.84 --> 4732.88
okay iron 26 i don't know what's

4732.08 --> 4736.4
happening with

4732.88 --> 4739.84
comments being dropped i'm not doing it

4736.4 --> 4742.08
right i'm not seeing anything

4739.84 --> 4743.28
i'm not even having to approve any of

4742.08 --> 4746.719
the messages

4743.28 --> 4748.4
from you guys so whatever is not coming

4746.719 --> 4752.719
through it's not because of me

4748.4 --> 4755.44
or because of these settings of my chat

4752.719 --> 4757.12
it's only one word blocked only one word

4755.44 --> 4758.719
and not even mentioning it so four

4757.12 --> 4762.32
letter word

4758.719 --> 4763.92
it's an e and an o you know which one

4762.32 --> 4765.759999999999
and that's it that's the only thing

4763.92 --> 4766.32
that's actually blocked so as long as

4765.76 --> 4777.84
you don't

4766.32 --> 4777.84
talk about that should be no problem

4787.12 --> 4793.36
yes doctor gone so yeah of course the

4790.08 --> 4793.36
globe lies ancient

4793.6 --> 4797.159000000001
where is it coming from i think it

4795.679 --> 4799.84
originally started out as a

4797.159 --> 4803.679
visualization process

4799.84 --> 4806.8
for storytelling tradition for priests

4803.679 --> 4810.2390000000005
in atlantean times even it might have

4806.8 --> 4813.12
been like the entire

4810.239 --> 4814.48
heliocentric model might be coming forth

4813.12 --> 4818.32
from a

4814.48 --> 4821.839999999999
atlantean age priest

4818.32 --> 4824.5599999999995
fantasy visualization exercise

4821.84 --> 4825.4400000000005
program i think that's what it probably

4824.56 --> 4829.120000000001
came from

4825.44 --> 4832.719
originally and because it just

4829.12 --> 4833.599999999999
worked out so well they figured out okay

4832.719 --> 4836.96
if you just

4833.6 --> 4839.6
really educated and

4836.96 --> 4842.8
reify it within the education then you

4839.6 --> 4844.88
can keep people in it

4842.8 --> 4847.76
and this probably happened first with

4844.88 --> 4851.28
just cults

4847.76 --> 4853.92
with a secret cult-like society for that

4851.28 --> 4855.36
and then later much later now in the the

4853.92 --> 4857.1990000000005
20th century

4855.36 --> 4859.36
then they started to put it in school

4857.199 --> 4862.4
and actually potentially

4859.36 --> 4862.4
like it is all real

4862.639 --> 4868.8
but i think that the idea of outer space

4865.92 --> 4870.719
and vacuum or maybe not the vacuum but

4868.8 --> 4874.320000000001
just all that space and visual

4870.719 --> 4875.92
balls like physical

4874.32 --> 4879.5199999999995
with orbits and all that i think that

4875.92 --> 4882.0
that as an idea is very old

4879.52 --> 4889.84
the visualization practices of that are

4882.0 --> 4889.84
ancient in my opinion

4891.84 --> 4894.2390000000005
what

4897.36 --> 4903.12
are you saying dr gunzo

4900.639 --> 4917.84
all right weird anyway i'll be back in

4903.12 --> 4917.84
two minutes

5001.52 --> 5015.84
all right

5026.84 --> 5029.84
hmm

5054.84 --> 5060.88
hmm

5057.52 --> 5063.120000000001
models reflect reality except when they

5060.88 --> 5066.719
don't

5063.12 --> 5070.88
larry to march a model

5066.719 --> 5072.08
can reflect reality or it can just say

5070.88 --> 5075.6
whatever the

5072.08 --> 5078.639
[ __ ] you want and not

5075.6 --> 5079.1990000000005
reflect reality at all and then when

5078.639 --> 5082.08
people

5079.199 --> 5083.5199999999995
point that out you still take it for

5082.08 --> 5099.84
granted anyway

5083.52 --> 5099.84
how about that

5114.56 --> 5118.320000000001
examples of models that don't work the

5117.04 --> 5122.159
ball earth

5118.32 --> 5123.199
the perfect example is the ultimate

5122.159 --> 5126.48
example

5123.199 --> 5130.638999999999
it's the most broken model humanity has

5126.48 --> 5131.12
ever devised i think sometimes that it

5130.639 --> 5134.32
was

5131.12 --> 5137.5199999999995
meant to be broken because that would be

5134.32 --> 5141.5199999999995
the only way it would stick

5137.52 --> 5145.040000000001
to people that can't handle

5141.52 --> 5147.84
that it's all lies i think that if

5145.04 --> 5150.239
it wasn't as filled with lies people

5147.84 --> 5152.96
would probably not be defending it as

5150.239 --> 5156.08
fanatically i think that the lies

5152.96 --> 5159.76
that are part of the model is

5156.08 --> 5162.88
what is preventing people from

5159.76 --> 5164.320000000001
engaging further into what it is holding

5162.88 --> 5167.679
on to the belief instead

5164.32 --> 5168.719
and then keeping keeping it up defending

5167.679 --> 5171.28
it i think it is

5168.719 --> 5172.8
because it is the most broken model ever

5171.28 --> 5175.199
created by humanity

5172.8 --> 5177.76
that people are probably defending it as

5175.199 --> 5180.0
much as they do

5177.76 --> 5182.2390000000005
because they just can't handle how

5180.0 --> 5185.76
broken it is

5182.239 --> 5187.199
it's like intellectual stockholm

5185.76 --> 5190.88
syndrome

5187.199 --> 5194.48
the model is such a liar such a blatant

5190.88 --> 5196.719
blatant brutal liar about so many things

5194.48 --> 5199.36
so derailing in critical thinking on

5196.719 --> 5202.0
every conceivable aspect

5199.36 --> 5202.799999999999
that people are just overwhelmed by it

5202.0 --> 5206.32
and there

5202.8 --> 5209.12
they can't handle it but

5206.32 --> 5210.799999999999
yeah but it's so present it's everywhere

5209.12 --> 5211.28
everybody believes in it and then they

5210.8 --> 5214.320000000001
just

5211.28 --> 5217.759999999999
give in to stockholm syndrome

5214.32 --> 5219.599999999999
to the lies

5217.76 --> 5221.4400000000005
and if they then keep defending that and

5219.6 --> 5221.84
holding on to that then they can make it

5221.44 --> 5225.28
their

5221.84 --> 5227.84
life's work to defend

5225.28 --> 5227.84
lies

5228.8 --> 5239.84
stockholm soldier that's what you all

5231.76 --> 5239.84
are you're all stockholm soldiers

5244.96 --> 5248.56
what is broken about oh nothing oh no

5247.92 --> 5251.36
let the

5248.56 --> 5252.0
ignorance bring forth let's forget

5251.36 --> 5253.679
everything

5252.0 --> 5255.199
that has ever happened every

5253.679 --> 5258.639
communication

5255.199 --> 5259.5199999999995
that has ever been done every argument

5258.639 --> 5262.719
ever told

5259.52 --> 5264.8
let's forget everything that exists and

5262.719 --> 5268.4
just ask

5264.8 --> 5272.2390000000005
what is broken about it i just said

5268.4 --> 5275.839999999999
everything every aspect every

5272.239 --> 5276.879999999999
aspect every aspect every aspect of the

5275.84 --> 5280.08
globe earth model

5276.88 --> 5284.2390000000005
is broken every freaking detail about it

5280.08 --> 5287.5199999999995
everything is broken about it everything

5284.239 --> 5288.32
everything name an aspect about the

5287.52 --> 5291.1990000000005
globe model

5288.32 --> 5292.32
i'll tell you how it's broken because

5291.199 --> 5295.36
every

5292.32 --> 5298.08
single aspect of the globe model

5295.36 --> 5298.48
is broken so whatever you're going to

5298.08 --> 5301.199
bring

5298.48 --> 5303.839999999999
forth about it i'll point out to you how

5301.199 --> 5303.839999999999
it's broken

5306.48 --> 5312.5599999999995
and i'm not dodging questions

5310.4 --> 5315.36
i'm addressing questions and i'm

5312.56 --> 5319.360000000001
addressing your behavior

5315.36 --> 5321.759999999999
and yeah it's funny how i

5319.36 --> 5323.679
kind of just talked about this

5321.76 --> 5326.4800000000005
elaborately and you're doing it

5323.679 --> 5327.92
right now because we have to waste all

5326.48 --> 5331.12
our time

5327.92 --> 5331.76
telling you how your model is broken so

5331.12 --> 5335.12
that you

5331.76 --> 5336.159000000001
immediately forget immediately because i

5335.12 --> 5339.28
do this

5336.159 --> 5342.32
every day larry the march every

5339.28 --> 5343.599999999999
[ __ ] day i keep telling you every

5342.32 --> 5347.199
[ __ ] day

5343.6 --> 5352.400000000001
every [ __ ] day

5347.199 --> 5355.678999999999
we tell you yeah and you forget

5352.4 --> 5356.32
like some amnesic idiot keep forgetting

5355.679 --> 5359.76
i'm not

5356.32 --> 5360.639
gonna keep telling you every [ __ ]

5359.76 --> 5364.4800000000005
aspect

5360.639 --> 5368.0
because we already do that we already

5364.48 --> 5371.678999999999
did that every day

5368.0 --> 5375.44
for years every

5371.679 --> 5380.159
day for years

5375.44 --> 5380.159
are you realizing you are demented yet

5380.719 --> 5387.28
every day for

5383.76 --> 5390.0
years do you realize

5387.28 --> 5394.5599999999995
that you're demented yet that you have

5390.0 --> 5394.56
very serious amnesia

5400.639 --> 5405.679
how can i explain that some light based

5403.12 --> 5408.719
celestial phenomena

5405.679 --> 5412.08
supposedly breaks things

5408.719 --> 5414.0
no it's lights it's freaking

5412.08 --> 5415.28
lights in the sky and there's no proof

5414.0 --> 5418.84
any of it is physical

5415.28 --> 5420.08
in any form so much proof against it

5418.84 --> 5423.12
actually

5420.08 --> 5424.8
yeah it's just because you got a a

5423.12 --> 5427.44
geometric model for the

5424.8 --> 5430.400000000001
supposed orbits and all that even though

5427.44 --> 5434.0
gravity doesn't work on mercury

5430.4 --> 5436.799999999999
it doesn't work every freaking aspect

5434.0 --> 5437.6
of your model is broken right it's just

5436.8 --> 5439.28
one point

5437.6 --> 5440.8
but yeah other than that it kind of

5439.28 --> 5442.08
works out it's really cool so you could

5440.8 --> 5445.04
just say oh but it works out

5442.08 --> 5445.36
look the geometric play thing we did

5445.04 --> 5447.92
with

5445.36 --> 5449.04
all this it works out so that means it's

5447.92 --> 5451.679
real right

5449.04 --> 5453.199
no that means it's a geometric play

5451.679 --> 5456.56
thing

5453.199 --> 5459.678999999999
that was designed on top of the row

5456.56 --> 5462.88
actual celestial sightings which have

5459.679 --> 5463.4400000000005
angular persistent locations in relation

5462.88 --> 5465.679
to the

5463.44 --> 5466.48
observer's position on the earth right

5465.679 --> 5469.04
that's what we

5466.48 --> 5469.599999999999
have data wise about the celestial

5469.04 --> 5472.48
lights

5469.6 --> 5473.679
now all these other aspects and these

5472.48 --> 5476.879999999999
phenomena

5473.679 --> 5480.639
phenomena about eclipses and

5476.88 --> 5482.639
seeing it before and after and all these

5480.639 --> 5484.32
interesting details right because it is

5482.639 --> 5487.4400000000005
an interesting sighting

5484.32 --> 5490.0
yeah none of it proves it's physical

5487.44 --> 5492.32
not a single thing you can't prove

5490.0 --> 5494.0
something is physical just by looking at

5492.32 --> 5496.08
it alone

5494.0 --> 5498.48
that's not how you establish a physical

5496.08 --> 5498.48
nature

5503.6 --> 5506.96
einstein explained the mercury orbit did

5506.48 --> 5508.718999999999
he

5506.96 --> 5511.28
he explained it well he couldn't have

5508.719 --> 5514.4
used his gravity math for it because

5511.28 --> 5515.44
einstein's gravity mathematics can't

5514.4 --> 5518.239
calculate

5515.44 --> 5519.599999999999
for more than one attractive body within

5518.239 --> 5522.159
the gravity

5519.6 --> 5523.84
so it can't do that oh he described it

5522.159 --> 5526.96
did it

5523.84 --> 5528.8
he described it what is really cool he

5526.96 --> 5531.52
couldn't calculate it though

5528.8 --> 5532.719
nobody can nobody can calculate the

5531.52 --> 5537.040000000001
orbit of mercury

5532.719 --> 5540.08
using gravity of any form

5537.04 --> 5542.56
in our supposed solar system

5540.08 --> 5544.719
oh he got a formula he got a formula

5542.56 --> 5546.080000000001
that doesn't prove gravity and that

5544.719 --> 5548.719
doesn't actually help

5546.08 --> 5551.6
you calculate the supposed gravity of

5548.719 --> 5554.88
the orbit of mercury that's really cool

5551.6 --> 5558.0
is mc yeah

5554.88 --> 5558.639
mc squared yeah it's really cool dr

5558.0 --> 5561.6
gonzo

5558.639 --> 5562.4800000000005
unfortunately it doesn't work it doesn't

5561.6 --> 5566.159000000001
actually

5562.48 --> 5568.48
even calculate the gravity right

5566.159 --> 5569.759999999999
so just saying that stupid little

5568.48 --> 5573.36
formula

5569.76 --> 5576.2390000000005
doesn't actually yield model

5573.36 --> 5577.599999999999
results based on gravity it doesn't

5576.239 --> 5580.718999999999
actually give you an

5577.6 --> 5581.84
answer but you're too stupid to even

5580.719 --> 5585.36
know this

5581.84 --> 5588.08
you're too stupid to even know that that

5585.36 --> 5591.199
stupid little formula

5588.08 --> 5594.96
isn't even an answer it doesn't actually

5591.199 --> 5596.159
help you model out the orbit of mercury

5594.96 --> 5598.96
using gravity

5596.159 --> 5600.719
it doesn't actually do it it's just a

5598.96 --> 5603.199
stupid random answer

5600.719 --> 5604.08
that you don't even know how it freaking

5603.199 --> 5606.4
ties in

5604.08 --> 5608.8
to the situation i just presented you

5606.4 --> 5611.36
with because you're a dumbass

5608.8 --> 5612.56
and you just blabber on repeating things

5611.36 --> 5616.799999999999
like parrots

5612.56 --> 5616.8
things that you don't even understand

5620.47 --> 5626.4800000000005
[Music]

5623.92 --> 5627.36
it's fun it's fun working with the fur i

5626.48 --> 5629.839999999999
know it's so much

5627.36 --> 5631.599999999999
fun it doesn't actually help you to

5629.84 --> 5633.04
calculate gravity for the orbit of

5631.6 --> 5635.76
mercury though

5633.04 --> 5637.639
and that's exactly the issue at hand

5635.76 --> 5640.719
yeah another aspect of the

5637.639 --> 5642.88
brokenness of the model

5640.719 --> 5644.0
you know the lovely little model you

5642.88 --> 5647.6
think is so perfect

5644.0 --> 5650.679
yeah i just gave you a glaring

5647.6 --> 5653.04
gap within the [ __ ]

5650.679 --> 5655.6
foundation of it all right there's an

5653.04 --> 5659.48
entire planet missing in your model

5655.6 --> 5661.76
yeah it's missing the planet is

5659.48 --> 5665.44
excluded

5661.76 --> 5667.08
within the orbital path situation of the

5665.44 --> 5669.759999999999
solar system it's

5667.08 --> 5672.239
excluded it's like

5669.76 --> 5672.88
it's not there they overlook oh yeah you

5672.239 --> 5675.5199999999995
see it

5672.88 --> 5676.400000000001
you see it in reality yeah and you could

5675.52 --> 5679.360000000001
just

5676.4 --> 5680.159
put it as a circle in wherever in the

5679.36 --> 5682.5599999999995
model

5680.159 --> 5683.599999999999
but when it comes to calculating it and

5682.56 --> 5686.080000000001
the balances

5683.6 --> 5686.639
between the supposed gravity forces and

5686.08 --> 5689.92
all that

5686.639 --> 5690.639
yeah nothing they don't calculate it you

5689.92 --> 5692.4800000000005
know why

5690.639 --> 5694.159000000001
because they can't because when they

5692.48 --> 5696.799999999999
include mercury

5694.159 --> 5698.32
using gravity like they do with the rest

5696.8 --> 5700.88
of the supposed planets

5698.32 --> 5703.679
and the sun and all that then it all

5700.88 --> 5707.96
falls apart and crashes into the sun

5703.679 --> 5710.8
yeah and that's a freaking fact

5707.96 --> 5714.2390000000005
fact yeah your

5710.8 --> 5717.92
model is broken utterly

5714.239 --> 5720.879999999999
the most broken model humanity has

5717.92 --> 5720.88
ever created

5721.79 --> 5724.84
[Music]

5726.159 --> 5730.638999999999
oh but you can see it though you can see

5728.56 --> 5733.119000000001
mercury so that makes it okay

5730.639 --> 5735.36
that you can't calculate the gravity

5733.119 --> 5737.44
within the presuppositional model of the

5735.36 --> 5737.92
solar system yeah it's okay because you

5737.44 --> 5740.719
can

5737.92 --> 5742.08
see it and if you can see it then you

5740.719 --> 5744.8
don't have to complete

5742.08 --> 5745.5199999999995
your model then you don't have to

5744.8 --> 5748.639
correct

5745.52 --> 5751.040000000001
the glaring error

5748.639 --> 5752.96
that is persistently being overlooked by

5751.04 --> 5756.48
heliocentric believers

5752.96 --> 5761.28
yeah we know

5756.48 --> 5761.28
just just don't think about it huh huh

5768.639 --> 5771.84
look at that squirt

5771.92 --> 5776.639
do the next observation but this

5773.84 --> 5779.679
observation this observation and this

5776.639 --> 5782.08
observation it proves so much except

5779.679 --> 5784.88
you can't actually calculate the gravity

5782.08 --> 5787.679
for the complete solar system

5784.88 --> 5789.52
but yeah observations right observations

5787.679 --> 5792.2390000000005
proves it's all real anyway

5789.52 --> 5792.8
because if you can see things and you

5792.239 --> 5794.879999999999
just

5792.8 --> 5797.04
ignore the calculations when it's really

5794.88 --> 5800.2390000000005
convenient to you

5797.04 --> 5802.4
then it's okay then the heliocentric

5800.239 --> 5804.4
model can be real right

5802.4 --> 5805.44
just don't think about it when it's not

5804.4 --> 5808.799999999999
convenient

5805.44 --> 5812.159
yeah your precious little model yeah

5808.8 --> 5814.4800000000005
i know your model is a liar that you

5812.159 --> 5817.599999999999
love her so much you're just addicted

5814.48 --> 5817.599999999999
you're addicted to this

5819.92 --> 5826.56
this old lying prostitute

5823.52 --> 5828.0
called globe earth

5826.56 --> 5841.84
you're just addicted to it you just

5828.0 --> 5841.84
can't help yourself

5847.36 --> 5853.88
no science classes oh you mean

5849.52 --> 5856.88
indoctrination classes where you have to

5853.88 --> 5859.92
disprovable [ __ ]

5856.88 --> 5864.2390000000005
in order to get a good grade you have to

5859.92 --> 5867.84
repeat the lies as part of the training

5864.239 --> 5869.36
dr console how many of those classes do

5867.84 --> 5871.679
you have to fill

5869.36 --> 5873.04
none you don't need to fail anything

5871.679 --> 5876.159
look you can still

5873.04 --> 5877.5199999999995
lie about their [ __ ] [ __ ]

5876.159 --> 5879.679
assertions

5877.52 --> 5880.639
and then pass it and still be a flat

5879.679 --> 5882.8
earther

5880.639 --> 5884.88
as long as you just know it's freaking

5882.8 --> 5888.719
[ __ ] and you don't have this

5884.88 --> 5890.8
impulse oh you must speak out about it

5888.719 --> 5892.88
like that would help anything like oh

5890.8 --> 5893.679
let's speak out in a class oh i'll

5892.88 --> 5897.1990000000005
surely

5893.679 --> 5900.639
just drop the class right it's not like

5897.199 --> 5902.96
the society has been entirely socially

5900.639 --> 5907.36
indoctrinated and re-engineered

5902.96 --> 5909.92
school wise in order to

5907.36 --> 5912.159
prevent people from stopping the

5909.92 --> 5915.92
indoctrination themselves

5912.159 --> 5919.599999999999
yeah people are indoctrinated

5915.92 --> 5922.4
to want the indoctrination

5919.6 --> 5923.119000000001
because the indoctrination helps to

5922.4 --> 5926.638999999999
prevent

5923.119 --> 5929.759999999999
them from letting it sink in that it's

5926.639 --> 5934.08
all a freaking lie

5929.76 --> 5934.08
it's all [ __ ] and they can't handle

5936.84 --> 5939.84
it

5942.96 --> 5946.719
see they keep on doing it they keep

5944.88 --> 5950.56
bringing the same

5946.719 --> 5954.2390000000005
[ __ ] up over and over

5950.56 --> 5956.400000000001
and over and over and over and over

5954.239 --> 5959.119
again because

5956.4 --> 5960.719
it's most of you most of you in my chat

5959.119 --> 5963.28
right now

5960.719 --> 5964.159
and it doesn't even tell me whether i

5963.28 --> 5967.04
have i see

5964.159 --> 5968.08
things about you that i like or not but

5967.04 --> 5971.92
but most of you

5968.08 --> 5974.96
are clinically demented

5971.92 --> 5978.08
you understand that you are clinically

5974.96 --> 5982.159
demented you have

5978.08 --> 5985.92
very poor ability very poor control

5982.159 --> 5989.679
over your memory because you keep asking

5985.92 --> 5993.28
the same demented stupid questions

5989.679 --> 5995.36
over and over and over and over

5993.28 --> 5996.88
and over again and then you get the

5995.36 --> 6000.0
answers over

5996.88 --> 6000.88
and over and over and over and over

6000.0 --> 6003.36
again

6000.88 --> 6005.52
and every time you forget and you ask

6003.36 --> 6007.199
the same stupid [ __ ] question over

6005.52 --> 6010.8
and over and over again

6007.199 --> 6014.879999999999
yeah like a freaking alzheimer

6010.8 --> 6016.96
patient like a demented idiot

6014.88 --> 6019.04
it just keeps on blabbering the same

6016.96 --> 6022.08
[ __ ] over and over again

6019.04 --> 6025.76
literally that's literally what you are

6022.08 --> 6028.88
do you understand here that is literally

6025.76 --> 6029.52
what oh you feel fine do you well why do

6028.88 --> 6033.36
you keep

6029.52 --> 6035.6
repeating the same demented [ __ ]

6033.36 --> 6036.96
over and over and over again even though

6035.6 --> 6039.1990000000005
you've been answered

6036.96 --> 6041.04
over and over and over again why do you

6039.199 --> 6043.199
keep forgetting why do you keep asking

6041.04 --> 6044.0
the same stupid question over and over

6043.199 --> 6046.5599999999995
again

6044.0 --> 6048.0
in my personal experience that only

6046.56 --> 6051.52
happens due to

6048.0 --> 6054.8
dementing due to amnesia

6051.52 --> 6058.2390000000005
and if amnesia keeps persisting

6054.8 --> 6060.96
then it turns into dementia yeah

6058.239 --> 6062.08
dementia is like persistent amnesia you

6060.96 --> 6063.52
can't remember it

6062.08 --> 6065.5199999999995
you can't remember it even though it's

6063.52 --> 6066.0
being told to you over and over and over

6065.52 --> 6069.4400000000005
again

6066.0 --> 6072.96
yeah clinically demented

6069.44 --> 6076.638999999999
your clinically demented ballers

6072.96 --> 6079.679
clinically demented i could prove this

6076.639 --> 6082.8
i could literally scientifically by

6079.679 --> 6088.639
medical standards prove you

6082.8 --> 6088.639
are demented yeah i can do that

6088.719 --> 6093.28
i already have enough material even to

6090.639 --> 6094.639
do that but i'd even do it face to face

6093.28 --> 6098.4
i'd have you guys

6094.639 --> 6100.88
face to face have you analyzed

6098.4 --> 6102.08
have you studied on your food habits all

6100.88 --> 6105.4400000000005
that [ __ ]

6102.08 --> 6107.44
and then roll out a study roll out a

6105.44 --> 6109.04
study and then have questions asked and

6107.44 --> 6111.119
let you read through it and then have to

6109.04 --> 6114.239
ask ask questions again

6111.119 --> 6116.96
and then i can prove that

6114.239 --> 6118.839999999999
a lot of you people here in chat are

6116.96 --> 6121.04
clinically

6118.84 --> 6123.76
demented

6121.04 --> 6124.56
yeah because that's the symptoms that

6123.76 --> 6126.96
you're showing

6124.56 --> 6128.2390000000005
it's unmistakable you people are

6126.96 --> 6130.56
clinically demented

6128.239 --> 6131.44
because you keep asking the same

6130.56 --> 6134.0
questions

6131.44 --> 6135.839999999999
over and over and over again you get the

6134.0 --> 6136.239
same answers over and over and over

6135.84 --> 6138.56
again

6136.239 --> 6139.599999999999
those answers address the questions in

6138.56 --> 6141.52
detail

6139.6 --> 6144.2390000000005
and then you forget every detail about

6141.52 --> 6148.080000000001
it again and ask it over and over again

6144.239 --> 6152.159
and that's what clinically demented is

6148.08 --> 6152.159
that's what you are yeah

6154.08 --> 6157.6
so you you feel at home do you any

6156.159 --> 6161.599999999999
france

6157.6 --> 6163.84
so i i'm right aren't i i'm right

6161.6 --> 6165.280000000001
you are clinically demented because you

6163.84 --> 6168.4800000000005
do keep on

6165.28 --> 6171.759999999999
asking the same questions

6168.48 --> 6174.799999999999
over and over and over again

6171.76 --> 6177.52
getting answers to those same questions

6174.8 --> 6178.96
over and over and over again and you ask

6177.52 --> 6180.719
them again anyway

6178.96 --> 6182.56
because you don't even know the answers

6180.719 --> 6185.44
because you forgot

6182.56 --> 6187.1990000000005
oh i'm so sick i'm so sick well at least

6185.44 --> 6189.5199999999995
i'm not clinically demented

6187.199 --> 6192.0
asking the same stupid questions over

6189.52 --> 6195.52
and over and over again

6192.0 --> 6198.08
and receiving answers yeah

6195.52 --> 6200.96
and then ignoring those answers not

6198.08 --> 6204.5599999999995
addressing the answers

6200.96 --> 6207.52
yeah frank frank i'm not that sick

6204.56 --> 6209.360000000001
i'm just pointing out a clinical fact

6207.52 --> 6210.159000000001
and that is that a lot of people here in

6209.36 --> 6213.28
chat

6210.159 --> 6216.879999999999
it's not exclusive to my chat though are

6213.28 --> 6220.159
provably clinically demented

6216.88 --> 6223.52
yeah very very sick to point out

6220.159 --> 6226.879999999999
that fact provable

6223.52 --> 6230.2390000000005
fact that you people are clinically

6226.88 --> 6232.8
demented yeah

6230.239 --> 6233.36
i can prove it oh but you don't like

6232.8 --> 6234.96
that

6233.36 --> 6236.799999999999
you don't like when flat earthers

6234.96 --> 6238.08
actually can prove things do you so

6236.8 --> 6240.8
you're just gonna

6238.08 --> 6243.119
do back go back forget all about it

6240.8 --> 6246.2390000000005
point out how i'm the mean man

6243.119 --> 6249.679
i'm so sick i'm so mean

6246.239 --> 6252.4
for pointing out the fact that you're

6249.679 --> 6254.2390000000005
clinically demented

6252.4 --> 6255.759999999999
right and you're not doing anything

6254.239 --> 6258.0
about it too

6255.76 --> 6260.0
you're not even letting it sink in that

6258.0 --> 6262.56
i might be on to something no no

6260.0 --> 6265.119
you're just gonna forget all about it

6262.56 --> 6268.320000000001
think about how mean arwen was

6265.119 --> 6270.5599999999995
saying mean things again

6268.32 --> 6271.679
wow forgetting everything that i

6270.56 --> 6273.4400000000005
actually said

6271.679 --> 6275.28
all the rebuttals that i gave all the

6273.44 --> 6278.638999999999
details all the information

6275.28 --> 6279.5199999999995
so you can just start over again and ask

6278.639 --> 6283.04
the same

6279.52 --> 6287.360000000001
stupid questions over and over

6283.04 --> 6291.92
and over again like a demented [ __ ]

6287.36 --> 6291.92
yeah i know i know that's what you do

6293.199 --> 6297.678999999999
but i am gonna round out the show

6295.44 --> 6299.36
nonetheless

6297.679 --> 6301.04
because i'm kind of down with this and

6299.36 --> 6302.4
this chat's just gonna be squirting

6301.04 --> 6303.679
anyway there's not going to be anything

6302.4 --> 6307.28
productive coming from it

6303.679 --> 6311.1990000000005
except more complaints

6307.28 --> 6311.92
and more well of the same questions over

6311.199 --> 6313.199
and over again

6311.92 --> 6315.4400000000005
anybody going to ask me about the

6313.199 --> 6316.08
celestial cross anybody going to ask me

6315.44 --> 6319.04
about some

6316.08 --> 6320.159
visual of an eclipse of something right

6319.04 --> 6323.04
like you do

6320.159 --> 6323.599999999999
every freaking day every freaking day

6323.04 --> 6326.48
about

6323.6 --> 6326.88
visuals that you presuppose are things

6326.48 --> 6329.5199999999995
yeah

6326.88 --> 6330.0
every freaking day you talk about it

6329.52 --> 6333.52
because you're

6330.0 --> 6333.52
demented i know

6335.36 --> 6338.639
yeah keep it up

6341.679 --> 6345.76
oh that's good for you dr gonzo glad

6344.56 --> 6347.679
that you at least

6345.76 --> 6350.320000000001
want to act like you've actually paid

6347.679 --> 6352.2390000000005
some attention i appreciate that

6350.32 --> 6354.0
i'm not saying necessarily that you

6352.239 --> 6356.239
specifically are demented

6354.0 --> 6358.239
dr ganzo i don't know you long enough

6356.239 --> 6360.5599999999995
for that i just know that people like

6358.239 --> 6364.5599999999995
larry the march

6360.56 --> 6364.56
right and people like indie franzen

6364.88 --> 6371.119
they are definitely demented

6369.199 --> 6373.199
i don't know if they were demented

6371.119 --> 6376.799999999999
before they got into

6373.199 --> 6380.08
a spherical earth zealotry

6376.8 --> 6382.2390000000005
or if spherical earth zealotry made

6380.08 --> 6384.4
them demented i'm not sure about the

6382.239 --> 6385.119
direct cause whether people that are

6384.4 --> 6389.119
naturally

6385.119 --> 6390.719
dementing latch onto globe religion

6389.119 --> 6392.4
or whether the globe religion

6390.719 --> 6395.119
effectively makes you

6392.4 --> 6395.759999999999
demented i'm not sure which one is the

6395.119 --> 6398.88
cause

6395.76 --> 6400.08
but i do know there is a very very

6398.88 --> 6402.8
strong persistent

6400.08 --> 6404.08
correlation that happens every single

6402.8 --> 6406.159000000001
time

6404.08 --> 6408.08
if you're a globe believer you're gonna

6406.159 --> 6410.5599999999995
forget every argument

6408.08 --> 6411.5199999999995
presented to you against the globe every

6410.56 --> 6414.96
single time

6411.52 --> 6419.1990000000005
and ask the same demented questions

6414.96 --> 6422.4
over and over and over and over again

6419.199 --> 6425.119
every day for the rest

6422.4 --> 6426.5599999999995
of your life you're going to be asking

6425.119 --> 6429.679
the same questions

6426.56 --> 6433.1990000000005
over and over and over again huh
