92.72 --> 96.56
yeah

93.68 --> 96.56
today the weather

98.32 --> 101.32
just

102.479 --> 107.36
it just now started to rain slightly

105.52 --> 108.64
less

107.36 --> 110.799
because

108.64 --> 112.64
not even five minutes ago there was so

110.799 --> 115.84
much rain you couldn't even see further

112.64 --> 115.84
than 20 meters ahead

117.119 --> 121.52
after that would you would just see

118.799 --> 124.399
water and that's it

121.52 --> 127.03999999999999
so it's very rainy it's been very rainy

124.399 --> 130.399
yesterday as well

127.04 --> 130.399
even throughout the night

134.4 --> 139.20000000000002
so yeah it's going back and forth

136.239 --> 142.64000000000001
sometimes like these clouds up there

139.2 --> 144.16
just seem to crash and then squish

142.64 --> 145.67999999999998
together and then lots of rain comes out

144.16 --> 148.16
of it and then it kind of goes away

145.68 --> 148.16
again but

151.04 --> 157.84
then before long

153.76 --> 157.84
the same situation happens

166.959 --> 170.8
there's a

168.0 --> 173.68
truck coming with it

170.8 --> 177.12
window thing and the beeping

173.68 --> 180.31900000000002
i hope it's not for here again but

177.12 --> 182.72
further down the road

180.319 --> 182.72
anyway

183.519 --> 189.59900000000002
it's clearing up a little even

186.8 --> 189.59900000000002
as we're looking

191.04 --> 196.07999999999998
and oh look at that over there it's even

193.519 --> 199.84
a bit of blue all of a sudden

196.08 --> 199.84
that really popped out of nowhere

207.44 --> 209.92
anyway

210.959 --> 213.84
hmm

218.56 --> 220.799
right

221.28 --> 227.12
hello mike sudonic first in chat good to

224.64 --> 230.07999999999998
see you

227.12 --> 234.04
it is wednesday the 6th

230.08 --> 234.04000000000002
of october 2021

248.159 --> 251.159
right

261.359 --> 266.79999999999995
right so yeah i had a little bit more

264.08 --> 269.12
sleep than i did yesterday

266.8 --> 270.8
not too much though still playing the

269.12 --> 273.04
game

270.8 --> 275.6
and it's keeping me up i've noticed that

273.04 --> 278.40000000000003
like i get very excited about the game

275.6 --> 280.47900000000004
and that's problematic because then

278.4 --> 282.4
it's not like oh i turn it off and i go

280.479 --> 285.28
to sleep because

282.4 --> 287.52
i need to wind down

285.28 --> 287.52
so

289.52 --> 294.24
i've almost forgot like i don't game

291.919 --> 297.52
like that anymore a lot

294.24 --> 300.0
it mostly just play older games when i

297.52 --> 301.68
feel like it don't really get caught up

300.0 --> 304.96
in it anymore

301.68 --> 308.32
so i had kind of forgotten about that

304.96 --> 308.32
some winding down time

308.84 --> 314.56
uh

310.72 --> 314.56
overall i'm decently rested

321.28 --> 327.11999999999995
yesterday

322.84 --> 329.039
show i thought was very good

327.12 --> 332.68
didn't get as many views as i had

329.039 --> 332.68
expected though

340.8 --> 347.479
huh i noticed now i'm looking right now

343.36 --> 347.47900000000004
that i've got a few comments

364.479 --> 371.44
also i've been noticing some interesting

368.8 --> 371.44
videos

376.319 --> 382.40000000000003
eric debay had a little snippet again oh

378.88 --> 382.4
yeah and martin litke

385.039 --> 388.639
i completely missed out on that

387.039 --> 392.31899999999996
yesterday

388.639 --> 393.52
was hanging around quantum eraser

392.319 --> 395.52000000000004
and yeah

393.52 --> 397.039
mitchell you know he wasn't actually

395.52 --> 399.19899999999996
doing a live stream he was just doing a

397.039 --> 401.44
reminder stream he does that sometimes

399.199 --> 403.68
so he opens his channel then it says

401.44 --> 403.68
like

403.919 --> 407.039
go to the other channel where i'm

405.52 --> 409.84
appearing live it's an interesting

407.039 --> 409.84
strategy

411.84 --> 416.31899999999996
to just put your stream on i'm live

414.8 --> 417.199
here's where you go

416.319 --> 419.12
yeah

417.199 --> 421.36
never even thought about that but

419.12 --> 422.96
mitchell does that and it works because

421.36 --> 426.72
he did come on

422.96 --> 429.84
huey live i didn't i just stuck the chat

426.72 --> 432.84000000000003
which i typically like to do

429.84 --> 432.84
uh

447.12 --> 450.12
right

452.0 --> 456.52
whoa

453.12 --> 456.52
where's everybody

466.0 --> 470.16
running ten minutes and there's still

467.919 --> 473.15999999999997
only mike sadoo niche in chat where is

470.16 --> 473.16
everybody

500.319 --> 506.319
oh yeah brian's logic had a little short

503.28 --> 510.28
one minute video with him on camera

506.319 --> 510.28000000000003
doesn't do that very often

520.88 --> 525.8389999999999
all right also yesterday's flat earth

522.479 --> 525.839
debate was good again

527.92 --> 533.4799999999999
didn't last the after show didn't last

530.0 --> 533.48
as long though

534.959 --> 539.76
but maybe like i think that nathan like

537.44 --> 541.6
two weeks ago had like two weeks where

539.76 --> 543.6
he would just the after shows would be

541.6 --> 548.2
incredibly long

543.6 --> 548.2
and now he's gonna stop doing that

548.72 --> 555.44
so it's like half an hour an hour max

553.04 --> 557.8389999999999
but yeah that's just fine

555.44 --> 559.519
it's just good that there is live fed

557.839 --> 563.0
again

559.519 --> 563.0
so okay

570.56 --> 574.5189999999999
is anybody out there

589.279 --> 594.32
right also by the way i have a new kind

591.68 --> 594.3199999999999
of a quick

594.72 --> 597.76
is it a custom

596.0 --> 599.519
[Music]

597.76 --> 602.24
url

599.519 --> 605.2
for my channel

602.24 --> 608.32
and it's called arwin 33

605.2 --> 611.6800000000001
so yeah instead of like the

608.32 --> 611.6800000000001
typical channel code

611.92 --> 616.079
you can also now

614.079 --> 619.8389999999999
what is it um

616.079 --> 619.8389999999999
let me check it out

620.88 --> 624.0
how do you find that

624.88 --> 628.079
i didn't bookmark it

629.04 --> 634.24
wait but i put the link out in skype

631.12 --> 634.24
i'll just go over there

636.16 --> 639.92
right it's

637.2 --> 640.8000000000001
youtube.com

639.92 --> 643.92
c

640.8 --> 643.92
r win33

645.04 --> 651.92
but if you use the old

647.519 --> 651.92
link it's practically the same thing

652.959 --> 657.64
but this is certainly easier to remember

661.519 --> 664.519
um

674.24 --> 678.8
okay

675.519 --> 681.519
okay guys where where is everybody

678.8 --> 684.8389999999999
supposedly six people watching

681.519 --> 684.839
where's everybody

710.8 --> 716.959
ah a lot of cps

714.48 --> 719.2
i've been doing well yeah i'm doing

716.959 --> 719.1999999999999
fine

720.24 --> 725.36
uh

721.2 --> 725.36
yesterday i was a little like a little

727.279 --> 731.92
a little tired because i didn't really

729.519 --> 734.079
have enough sleep still i did a great

731.92 --> 735.1999999999999
show i think

734.079 --> 737.8389999999999
today

735.2 --> 740.639
i feel kind of similar except a little

737.839 --> 744.12
bit more rested but not too much not

740.639 --> 744.12
perfectly rested

744.88 --> 749.92
all right and the qe show was about food

747.44 --> 752.639
and mechanical bows yeah yeah he did

749.92 --> 756.8389999999999
talk about that didn't he

752.639 --> 760.9590000000001
those bows they look more like ballistas

756.839 --> 760.9590000000001
like hand blisters

761.36 --> 765.5600000000001
hey america silver patriot

777.36 --> 781.6800000000001
i'm surprised that i didn't get any kind

779.519 --> 784.399
of challenge

781.68 --> 786.6389999999999
because i was there in chat

784.399 --> 789.12
but i'm surprised that like qe didn't

786.639 --> 791.44
even poke me

789.12 --> 792.32
about the show that i've done

791.44 --> 796.0790000000001
like

792.32 --> 796.0790000000001
purely focused on the light thing

797.04 --> 800.959
i thought i would get a lot more

798.639 --> 803.2
comments a lot more quickly

800.959 --> 806.399
especially since i called the hangout

803.2 --> 806.399
after that subject

813.6 --> 818.16
i named it after the subject

818.72 --> 822.519
oh that english

828.8 --> 832.399
so what have you all been up to

836.32 --> 840.48
any comments

838.399 --> 842.399
anybody here that was

840.48 --> 844.639
there yesterday in chat or that have

842.399 --> 848.279
watched my hangout any comments about

844.639 --> 848.279
yesterday's show

880.399 --> 885.6
or is this gonna be one of the shows

883.04 --> 887.68
where i'm just sitting looking at the

885.6 --> 889.9200000000001
chat

887.68 --> 893.199
and not saying a lot i mean that could

889.92 --> 896.639
be this show guys i've like still an

893.199 --> 896.639
hour 40 minutes left

896.8 --> 900.399
i could address questions

899.199 --> 901.4399999999999
explain

900.399 --> 903.839
things

901.44 --> 906.48
or i could just stare at the chat

903.839 --> 910.1600000000001
waiting for any kind of input

906.48 --> 913.04
i don't have any specific subjects

910.16 --> 914.48
that are on my mind

913.04 --> 915.199
surprisingly

914.48 --> 917.36
i

915.199 --> 920.8
set out to make some notes yesterday but

917.36 --> 920.8000000000001
i didn't do it after all

924.88 --> 930.0
a tree of life

927.12 --> 932.24
anyone know how robskeep is no i

930.0 --> 932.24
that's

932.88 --> 940.68
i haven't heard anything from him yet

935.68 --> 940.68
and i i think that's probably good news

951.759 --> 957.44
you are on point about the paradise

954.8 --> 958.959
fires what

957.44 --> 962.0790000000001
oh

958.959 --> 962.079
oh that's way back

962.16 --> 966.519
you mean about the dew

968.079 --> 973.279
with all the disintegrated

971.12 --> 975.519
engine blocks and

973.279 --> 977.8389999999999
brick mortars while the trees are just

975.519 --> 979.519
perfectly fine green

977.839 --> 982.519
right next to it that

979.519 --> 982.519
right

988.16 --> 991.759
no i stand behind everything about

994.839 --> 998.9200000000001
that um

1010.0 --> 1013.0
hmm

1032.0 --> 1037.76
also finished up watching the uh own

1034.48 --> 1040.64
benjamin show from monday

1037.76 --> 1040.64
good like

1042.24 --> 1045.039
it was all good

1050.0 --> 1056.6
didn't see any streams from yesterday

1052.88 --> 1056.6000000000001
just yet anyway

1084.88 --> 1092.6190000000001
hey james mason good to see you

1089.47 --> 1092.619
[Music]

1099.039 --> 1104.4
you know that i'm still kind of in awe

1101.12 --> 1109.4799999999998
of the whole thing with isles g

1104.4 --> 1109.48
like he had a tooth ache issue

1110.08 --> 1114.24
and i recommended him the magnesium

1114.559 --> 1120.48
and that it worked so well because

1117.36 --> 1123.52
that's a tip i didn't get from anybody

1120.48 --> 1125.76
you see i

1123.52 --> 1127.9189999999999
look around and i like quickly

1125.76 --> 1130.24
assimilate

1127.919 --> 1132.5590000000002
information sometimes i just put it in a

1130.24 --> 1135.679
subconscious and then later it just

1132.559 --> 1139.52
comes bubbling up well this thing

1135.679 --> 1142.24
if i ever got it from somebody

1139.52 --> 1145.039
like i have only two

1142.24 --> 1147.52
two possible leads as to the sourcing of

1145.039 --> 1150.559
it and that is either

1147.52 --> 1152.16
it happened to me when i was very young

1150.559 --> 1154.8799999999999
at a dentist

1152.16 --> 1157.039
that just said okay here take this

1154.88 --> 1159.44
and then didn't even tell me what it was

1157.039 --> 1162.32
and when or i asked and they told me

1159.44 --> 1164.4
like magnesium solution i didn't even

1162.32 --> 1166.8799999999999
remember it

1164.4 --> 1168.3200000000002
i was still so much very young and

1166.88 --> 1170.0800000000002
trusting

1168.32 --> 1171.12
and it just worked so either that

1170.08 --> 1173.52
happened

1171.12 --> 1175.9189999999999
or it was through my vision because i i

1173.52 --> 1178.4
have a distinct imprint from my vision

1175.919 --> 1180.48
memories about that

1178.4 --> 1183.039
that kind of makes it hard to figure out

1180.48 --> 1185.1200000000001
whether that really happened or not

1183.039 --> 1186.48
but that could be a source in which case

1185.12 --> 1189.84
it would have been like

1186.48 --> 1189.84
over 30 years ago

1190.32 --> 1198.1599999999999
or i just myself accidentally discovered

1194.08 --> 1200.32
it as i was kind of like oh

1198.16 --> 1202.88
impulsively remember

1200.32 --> 1205.6789999999999
impulsively i took it it was kind of

1202.88 --> 1208.0
like indirectly inspired because of alex

1205.679 --> 1208.799
jones had a magnesium product he brought

1208.0 --> 1211.679
out

1208.799 --> 1213.44
at one point it was very exhilarated

1211.679 --> 1217.52
about it

1213.44 --> 1219.3600000000001
and it is overall like good for things

1217.52 --> 1221.6
but

1219.36 --> 1223.9189999999999
yeah i bought

1221.6 --> 1226.08
the thing in this in the organic

1223.919 --> 1227.679
supermarket that has supplements good

1226.08 --> 1230.3999999999999
supplements i get all my supplements

1227.679 --> 1230.4
they're pretty much

1230.64 --> 1234.4
the most one the most

1232.72 --> 1236.48
and

1234.4 --> 1240.5590000000002
in that period i just happened to have

1236.48 --> 1240.559
typical jaw issues as i have

1241.44 --> 1246.799
and used it and it just

1244.32 --> 1248.72
suddenly unexpectedly worked against it

1246.799 --> 1250.96
so it is kind of like

1248.72 --> 1253.3600000000001
a rediscovery

1250.96 --> 1256.4
or really a new discovery that just has

1253.36 --> 1256.3999999999999
this weird echo

1256.88 --> 1261.679
where i might have seen that like 20

1259.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
years ago if through my visions but just

1261.679 --> 1267.1200000000001
like

1263.84 --> 1269.52
like everything cassandra complex just

1267.12 --> 1271.52
can't handle things from the future yet

1269.52 --> 1273.039
i didn't know that

1271.52 --> 1274.6399999999999
whatever

1273.039 --> 1276.799
but i'm very

1274.64 --> 1278.96
surprised and happy that that actually

1276.799 --> 1280.96
works

1278.96 --> 1283.039
turns out it works

1280.96 --> 1286.159
because it first worked on me and then

1283.039 --> 1286.1589999999999
lg just asked

1287.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
he made his wife get it

1289.52 --> 1293.6
and he tried it and it worked

1291.84 --> 1295.9189999999999
and the next day it still worked and

1293.6 --> 1298.0
that's like wow

1295.919 --> 1300.72
that's an amazing

1298.0 --> 1300.72
discovery

1301.12 --> 1304.559
just

1302.08 --> 1306.799
happy about it

1304.559 --> 1307.6789999999999
happy to kind of have that tied in with

1306.799 --> 1310.32
me

1307.679 --> 1314.0800000000002
because like yeah

1310.32 --> 1315.84
hey guys i found a cure for a cute

1314.08 --> 1318.24
toothache

1315.84 --> 1321.6789999999999
like the worst of it without you being

1318.24 --> 1323.6
forced to take like mind-altering drugs

1321.679 --> 1326.48
to suppress pain and [ __ ] and cause

1323.6 --> 1328.1589999999999
addictions right

1326.48 --> 1331.48
hi

1328.159 --> 1331.48
you're welcome

1337.919 --> 1342.88
and it's super cheap too

1339.84 --> 1346.32
like unbelievably cheap i think that a

1342.88 --> 1348.88
single dose

1346.32 --> 1352.08
to basically cause instant relief like a

1348.88 --> 1353.5200000000002
super mini amount of powder should be

1352.08 --> 1356.6399999999999
maybe

1353.52 --> 1356.6399999999999
5 cent

1357.44 --> 1362.24
can't think of anything cheaper except

1360.32 --> 1363.28
maybe if you're like really good with

1362.24 --> 1365.52
herbs

1363.28 --> 1367.12
and you know just like oh this and this

1365.52 --> 1369.039
plant you could pick

1367.12 --> 1370.32
yeah then it would be practically for

1369.039 --> 1372.4
free

1370.32 --> 1374.96
and maybe work even better i don't know

1372.4 --> 1377.76
but this just works really great and

1374.96 --> 1377.76
it's super cheap

1378.32 --> 1382.96
i'm curious to hear other people

1381.039 --> 1385.2
if they arrive at some point where they

1382.96 --> 1387.1200000000001
get toothache or something

1385.2 --> 1390.4
that they try to and i'd

1387.12 --> 1393.3999999999999
love to hear some feedback about it

1390.4 --> 1393.4
right

1427.36 --> 1430.36
so

1430.559 --> 1434.9189999999999
another five minutes has passed

1447.6 --> 1451.52
how's everybody doing out there what's

1449.84 --> 1454.08
busying you

1451.52 --> 1456.72
like are you really in like

1454.08 --> 1459.12
a rainy windy restless mood and that's

1456.72 --> 1461.039
why you're like frantically

1459.12 --> 1463.4399999999998
trying to get away from the sensation of

1461.039 --> 1466.08
the dying summer and occupying yourself

1463.44 --> 1468.3200000000002
with like

1466.08 --> 1471.36
maintenance work or something

1468.32 --> 1474.72
that would explain why so little chat

1471.36 --> 1476.1589999999999
is actually taking place right now

1474.72 --> 1478.64
and i think that a lot of people that

1476.159 --> 1480.24
follow my show for some reason like to

1478.64 --> 1484.4
put me on

1480.24 --> 1484.4
the background while they do chores

1484.96 --> 1489.76
i guess i'm i'm gr i'm very inspiring to

1488.32 --> 1492.0
work

1489.76 --> 1494.0
and in a funny ironic way i kind of like

1492.0 --> 1499.4
that i like

1494.0 --> 1499.4
i also like watching other people work

1501.3 --> 1506.3999999999999
[Laughter]

1504.08 --> 1506.3999999999999
uh

1507.84 --> 1511.6
like without feeling any objections for

1510.48 --> 1514.64
not

1511.6 --> 1518.7199999999998
doing that also

1514.64 --> 1518.72
although i like to contribute somehow

1524.559 --> 1528.48
last time i had a 2k it was an abscess

1526.72 --> 1530.799
very yeah

1528.48 --> 1533.039
right well cps

1530.799 --> 1535.2
the next time you have something like

1533.039 --> 1536.64
that

1535.2 --> 1539.44
try it out

1536.64 --> 1543.1200000000001
try out magnesium citrate

1539.44 --> 1545.919
powder dissolved in water and just rinse

1543.12 --> 1547.6
it in your mouth huh i'll google the

1545.919 --> 1549.039
word

1547.6 --> 1550.7199999999998
rinse

1549.039 --> 1552.48
vincent repeat

1550.72 --> 1554.96
because

1552.48 --> 1558.159
i had some doubt sometimes i get

1554.96 --> 1560.08
automated words in my head like this is

1558.159 --> 1562.72
how you say that

1560.08 --> 1564.8799999999999
but then i get doubts like but what does

1562.72 --> 1567.2
it even mean

1564.88 --> 1569.3600000000001
and one of those words was like oh you

1567.2 --> 1571.52
not flush it but you rinse it in your

1569.36 --> 1573.52
mouth and i was like

1571.52 --> 1575.44
rinse is supposed to mean what i think

1573.52 --> 1577.9189999999999
it means but i wasn't sure then i looked

1575.44 --> 1580.72
it up and then yes it meant exactly what

1577.919 --> 1580.72
i thought it meant

1581.52 --> 1588.72
a lot of times i just get words

1584.48 --> 1591.039
available to me but then i use them

1588.72 --> 1594.64
but then i get like doubts like did that

1591.039 --> 1594.64
actually mean what i thought it meant

1594.799 --> 1599.84
but most of the times it turns out that

1596.96 --> 1599.8400000000001
it is correct

1600.48 --> 1604.72
oh now that works

1603.12 --> 1606.799
right anyway

1604.72 --> 1610.4
just rinse it in your mouth shortly and

1606.799 --> 1613.44
then like the biggest pushing

1610.4 --> 1615.919
pain influence should like quickly

1613.44 --> 1619.1200000000001
it takes the the top off

1615.919 --> 1622.96
it doesn't completely make it go away

1619.12 --> 1625.279
but it it takes the edge of the pain

1622.96 --> 1628.159
that is how ilsg described it and that

1625.279 --> 1630.4
is how i originally described the effect

1628.159 --> 1632.72
so it might be very well worth trying

1630.4 --> 1634.24
and even if that for some reason doesn't

1632.72 --> 1637.679
work

1634.24 --> 1639.679
it's good for many other things as well

1637.679 --> 1643.1200000000001
like for me it's been

1639.679 --> 1646.159
helpful with my digestion system

1643.12 --> 1648.0
because tensions typically reflect very

1646.159 --> 1650.159
much on my intestines

1648.0 --> 1654.12
and this actually works again it just

1650.159 --> 1654.1200000000001
smoothen everything out

1655.919 --> 1660.72
it also works at basically against

1658.399 --> 1664.399
sleeplessness because of tension

1660.72 --> 1668.48
and that's how i use it sometimes

1664.399 --> 1670.7199999999998
right so magnesium citrate it is

1668.48 --> 1673.3600000000001
amazing

1670.72 --> 1676.0
multi-purpose i'm just only starting to

1673.36 --> 1679.12
tap into what it can do

1676.0 --> 1679.12
and it's so cheap

1679.279 --> 1683.039
hey american silver patriot thanks for

1681.039 --> 1688.12
the five dollar super chat donation flat

1683.039 --> 1688.12
all day yeah no it's always flat

1698.64 --> 1702.48
uh what's in one video

1702.88 --> 1706.159
so

1703.6 --> 1706.1589999999999
yeah yeah

1707.12 --> 1711.08
that's from a while ago

1711.36 --> 1716.399
yeah from michael khan had his video

1715.6 --> 1718.7199999999998
it's

1716.399 --> 1721.1999999999998
i've seen it before

1718.72 --> 1724.32
he puts a song under it but it's like

1721.2 --> 1727.2
going over the suez canal with the ship

1724.32 --> 1731.6789999999999
just a non-stop shot

1727.2 --> 1731.679
and it's so unbelievably flat

1734.64 --> 1740.24
i'll link you through

1736.72 --> 1740.24
if you haven't seen it yet

1740.96 --> 1744.96
it's a pretty good video

1743.12 --> 1746.08
it's very basic

1744.96 --> 1748.48
it's

1746.08 --> 1751.8799999999999
only three minutes long

1748.48 --> 1751.88
check it out

1757.36 --> 1762.32
just got parked for a minute what do you

1759.52 --> 1762.32
mean parked

1763.919 --> 1767.48
you on the road

1772.72 --> 1777.91
hello dm

1774.71 --> 1777.91
[Music]

1785.279 --> 1788.399
daniel rubbles

1792.159 --> 1796.64
right yeah james mason just woke up

1793.919 --> 1798.88
because it's in the united states

1796.64 --> 1801.1200000000001
which apparently on the west coast is

1798.88 --> 1805.24
freaking four o'clock i had no idea it

1801.12 --> 1805.2399999999998
was that insanely early

1809.12 --> 1814.76
uh

1810.799 --> 1814.76
hello jason cormack

1824.399 --> 1832.799
it's 7 35 here

1829.039 --> 1832.799
okay so you're on the east coast

1834.64 --> 1837.8400000000001
hey slow mo moon buggy

1842.159 --> 1844.48
ah

1845.44 --> 1849.76
gas not having a downward factor his

1847.12 --> 1852.32
head put propane has a downward factor

1849.76 --> 1852.32
now it's

1854.72 --> 1858.799
look the whole thing about the downward

1856.96 --> 1862.88
factor slow mo moon buggy it's

1858.799 --> 1865.44
complicated because relative density has

1862.88 --> 1866.88
a downward and upward factor

1865.44 --> 1869.679
both

1866.88 --> 1871.919
that's the axis the axis of displacement

1869.679 --> 1872.88
due to this equilibrium

1871.919 --> 1875.2
a

1872.88 --> 1875.2
gas

1875.279 --> 1880.399
just goes in all directions eventually

1878.32 --> 1883.36
but where if it's still kind of an

1880.399 --> 1885.9189999999999
isolated body then it will displace

1883.36 --> 1888.399
downward in relation to

1885.919 --> 1891.96
the medium if that medium

1888.399 --> 1891.9599999999998
is less dense

1892.48 --> 1896.88
so yeah propane at first might go down

1895.36 --> 1900.4799999999998
for a little

1896.88 --> 1902.96
but then if very quickly if open to the

1900.48 --> 1907.3990000000001
air it will dissipate and spread in all

1902.96 --> 1907.3990000000001
directions it will mix in

1910.159 --> 1914.96
right the whole downward factor issue

1912.32 --> 1917.84
and why nathan also likes to emphasize

1914.96 --> 1920.32
like gas does not go down go boom boom

1917.84 --> 1922.399
is because of what the assumption that's

1920.32 --> 1924.32
tied into the downward factor and that

1922.399 --> 1927.1999999999998
is the gravity the gravity that only

1924.32 --> 1928.6399999999999
goes down that everything is pushed

1927.2 --> 1931.519
down

1928.64 --> 1933.2
that is the main argument

1931.519 --> 1935.84
that is being

1933.2 --> 1935.8400000000001
broken up

1936.799 --> 1941.84
because there is no gravity downward

1939.44 --> 1941.8400000000001
factor

1942.32 --> 1947.36
relative density goes up and down all

1944.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
depending on the relation

1947.36 --> 1953.9189999999999
between the object and the medium

1949.84 --> 1953.9189999999999
that the density differential

1958.0 --> 1962.96
but yeah gas

1961.039 --> 1967.2
when not contained

1962.96 --> 1967.2
goes in all directions eventually

1968.88 --> 1973.8400000000001
like when not separately contained

1972.24 --> 1975.6
if it's in an open container or

1973.84 --> 1977.4399999999998
something then eventually it will just

1975.6 --> 1979.6
spread out in all direction mix in with

1977.44 --> 1981.919
the inhomogeneous

1979.6 --> 1981.9189999999999
mesh

1982.0 --> 1985.2
of gas on earth

1987.919 --> 1993.6000000000001
strength there even for house racing i

1990.88 --> 1996.159
don't know what that means

1993.6 --> 1996.1589999999999
denium

1997.76 --> 2001.12
density is mass

1999.919 --> 2004.3600000000001
volume

2001.12 --> 2004.36
no direction

2004.799 --> 2007.84
uh

2005.6 --> 2007.84
what

2011.6 --> 2016.7199999999998
no that's

2012.88 --> 2018.88
the density of material relative density

2016.72 --> 2021.279
is about the relation between the

2018.88 --> 2022.64
density of an object and the medium it

2021.279 --> 2024.159
is in

2022.64 --> 2027.1200000000001
if there is a

2024.159 --> 2030.24
differential between them

2027.12 --> 2033.279
that indicates a disequilibrium

2030.24 --> 2035.76
and that this equilibrium manifests a

2033.279 --> 2038.24
force that causes

2035.76 --> 2040.24
acceleration and displacement and if

2038.24 --> 2042.799
there is no maneuverability

2040.24 --> 2044.159
then it causes pressure in the this

2042.799 --> 2047.1589999999999
equilibrium

2044.159 --> 2047.159
direction

2050.079 --> 2053.8390000000004
and that

2051.2 --> 2055.2
the downwards this equilibrium

2053.839 --> 2056.24
pressure

2055.2 --> 2059.2
is then

2056.24 --> 2062.9599999999996
numerically sized up

2059.2 --> 2065.6789999999996
in a medium of air and that is has been

2062.96 --> 2068.159
made into the convention of weight

2065.679 --> 2070.399
that's how it's calculated

2068.159 --> 2072.2400000000002
but on top of that there is the science

2070.399 --> 2074.6389999999997
fiction framework of newtonian

2072.24 --> 2078.0789999999997
mechanics-based thinking where there is

2074.639 --> 2079.44
a little g as as a newtonian law within

2078.079 --> 2082.32
his model

2079.44 --> 2084.879
that is a downward force

2082.32 --> 2086.159
but he didn't take into account gas

2084.879 --> 2089.56
behavior

2086.159 --> 2089.56
with that model

2092.639 --> 2095.839
only

2093.679 --> 2098.96
how

2095.839 --> 2100.96
gases may pose friction

2098.96 --> 2103.68
towards

2100.96 --> 2105.359
solid and liquid objects falling through

2103.68 --> 2108.0789999999997
it that's the only way it was

2105.359 --> 2110.16
incorporated the friction of air was

2108.079 --> 2112.5600000000004
incorporated within newtonian mechanics

2110.16 --> 2115.04
and that's the only aspect about air

2112.56 --> 2117.839
that was incorporated into newtonian

2115.04 --> 2120.839
mechanics

2117.839 --> 2120.839
see

2142.56 --> 2146.24
okay george sanford

2144.64 --> 2148.72
weird

2146.24 --> 2153.4799999999996
well propane tanks look it

2148.72 --> 2153.48
inside it's stored in liquid form

2160.16 --> 2163.3199999999997
i think

2173.119 --> 2178.6400000000003
all right anyway

2174.96 --> 2178.64
hope that is uh informative

2181.77 --> 2186.32
[Music]

2183.52 --> 2189.21
i am coming through loud and clear right

2186.32 --> 2192.32
there's no sound issues

2189.21 --> 2192.32
[Music]

2212.56 --> 2216.64
oh yeah american silver page i was gonna

2214.72 --> 2219.1189999999997
ask like are you a truck driver

2216.64 --> 2220.56
apparently you are good to know

2219.119 --> 2222.88
i think you might have said that before

2220.56 --> 2225.04
when like truck driving and

2222.88 --> 2226.839
automated

2225.04 --> 2229.7599999999998
trucks

2226.839 --> 2233.52
came afloat as a subject in the show

2229.76 --> 2233.5200000000004
what is it two days ago three days ago

2237.599 --> 2241.48
all right sounds good

2242.64 --> 2248.56
so any more questions

2245.119 --> 2251.8
i like questions see how easy it is

2248.56 --> 2251.7999999999997
for me

2266.88 --> 2270.96
oh

2268.16 --> 2274.0
look at that

2270.96 --> 2274.0
it's the sun

2280.4 --> 2282.7200000000003
nice

2283.2 --> 2289.839
it's like i can feel the sun on my hand

2286.0 --> 2292.4
right now and it's very warm

2289.839 --> 2292.4
so yeah

2295.52 --> 2301.04
like when that sun comes through it is

2298.0 --> 2301.04
like really nice

2304.079 --> 2307.4
so bright

2327.92 --> 2330.16
okay

2332.0 --> 2336.079
then

2333.28 --> 2338.7200000000003
i am gonna

2336.079 --> 2338.7200000000003
probably

2339.599 --> 2342.7200000000003
block you at some point you seem like a

2341.44 --> 2344.48
troll

2342.72 --> 2347.9199999999996
i

2344.48 --> 2351.88
could you make some logically consistent

2347.92 --> 2351.88
statement of some sort

2358.16 --> 2362.64
ballers seem to think if you

2360.24 --> 2364.9599999999996
offer no explanation then it must be a

2362.64 --> 2364.96
ball

2365.28 --> 2369.28
no

2367.359 --> 2372.0789999999997
they think it must be a ball really no

2369.28 --> 2372.079
matter what you do

2375.599 --> 2379.04
right

2377.68 --> 2381.04
just because you don't offer an

2379.04 --> 2385.04
explanation doesn't immediately make a

2381.04 --> 2385.04
ball when i go sometimes like

2386.88 --> 2391.28
and i don't

2388.4 --> 2393.92
explain it that doesn't make it a ball

2391.28 --> 2395.6800000000003
that just makes me very tired

2393.92 --> 2397.839
hearing the same crap over and over

2395.68 --> 2397.839
again

2399.599 --> 2402.96
hey the natto br

2404.0 --> 2406.48
continue in a while

2405.68 --> 2409.96
yeah

2406.48 --> 2409.96
i'm doing great

2410.56 --> 2414.0789999999997
can you talk about perspective what do

2412.96 --> 2416.7200000000003
you want me

2414.079 --> 2419.3590000000004
to talk about concerning perspective

2416.72 --> 2422.319
america's silver patriot

2419.359 --> 2423.44
gloomy day here lena's columbone's tomb

2422.319 --> 2426.16
uh

2423.44 --> 2426.16
mo moonbuggy

2427.839 --> 2433.64
as a baller i would disagree with that

2429.68 --> 2433.64
that's hilarious cps

2446.079 --> 2449.76
globe still a matter of faith yes

2451.44 --> 2455.04
we build it with our minds

2457.839 --> 2461.72
can't just give up

2468.8 --> 2473.599
hello moonshadow have i proposed a topic

2471.68 --> 2476.56
for this afternoon well if i had i would

2473.599 --> 2480.48
put it up in the title so no not really

2476.56 --> 2483.359
i'm kind of just reflecting on recent

2480.48 --> 2486.16
subjects and situations that have come

2483.359 --> 2486.16
by the show

2493.04 --> 2498.079
for example the southern stars

2496.24 --> 2500.56
yeah but

2498.079 --> 2503.76
that's just their look james mason why

2500.56 --> 2505.359
the ballers hang on to that is anti-flat

2503.76 --> 2507.28
earthism

2505.359 --> 2510.72
it's because they are hanging on to the

2507.28 --> 2513.6800000000003
false dichotomy of the disc model versus

2510.72 --> 2515.2799999999997
their spherical model

2513.68 --> 2517.359
then it doesn't make sense to them

2515.28 --> 2519.0400000000004
because they are assuming that flat

2517.359 --> 2521.119
earthers claim

2519.04 --> 2523.04
all the stars and all the celestials are

2521.119 --> 2525.44
in the euclidean positions above the

2523.04 --> 2525.44
disk

2526.319 --> 2530.4
and then

2527.839 --> 2533.359
yeah then you look at the southern cross

2530.4 --> 2535.6800000000003
the southern rotation of the celestial

2533.359 --> 2538.88
demisphere and then it gets a little

2535.68 --> 2540.96
weird yeah i would agree if you go by

2538.88 --> 2543.2000000000003
that presupposition based false

2540.96 --> 2546.0
dichotomy assumption yeah then it is a

2543.2 --> 2548.839
weird yeah yeah

2546.0 --> 2551.599
i don't claim that model

2548.839 --> 2553.599
though and i definitely do not claim

2551.599 --> 2556.96
euclidean positions

2553.599 --> 2556.96
for celestial bodies

2560.96 --> 2566.319
right but james mason they go as far as

2563.839 --> 2569.119
even to say stupid things like

2566.319 --> 2570.319
oh you wouldn't have a horizon on a flat

2569.119 --> 2572.7200000000003
earth

2570.319 --> 2575.2799999999997
because you would see everything like

2572.72 --> 2576.839
they just say that

2575.28 --> 2580.4
it's

2576.839 --> 2582.48
ridiculous saying that is based on

2580.4 --> 2584.319
believing the machination is a true

2582.48 --> 2589.04
representation of reality the

2584.319 --> 2591.04
machination of the perspective excluding

2589.04 --> 2594.24
autographic view

2591.04 --> 2596.72
sphere assumption system

2594.24 --> 2598.4799999999996
by that from that perspective looking at

2596.72 --> 2600.8799999999997
the side globe at the side of your head

2598.48 --> 2602.88
it's like yeah if it were flat oh look

2600.88 --> 2605.52
you could see everything

2602.88 --> 2607.839
that's it that's what that is it's

2605.52 --> 2610.96
ridiculous to us because no of course

2607.839 --> 2614.0
that's not how it works

2610.96 --> 2616.4
but they'll think it anyway

2614.0 --> 2618.88
because they

2616.4 --> 2621.28
have no issues whatsoever

2618.88 --> 2623.44
to take straw man

2621.28 --> 2625.599
miss assumptions about what flat

2623.44 --> 2629.599
earthers think and then use it to

2625.599 --> 2631.44
legitimize their more complete model

2629.599 --> 2635.079
that's what they do

2631.44 --> 2635.079
it's part of their religion

2637.92 --> 2642.56
always say that the stars rotated oh my

2640.4 --> 2644.56
god donato oh

2642.56 --> 2646.839
that's worse that's like

2644.56 --> 2648.56
sean hawkins

2646.839 --> 2650.0
syndrome

2648.56 --> 2652.319
like yeah

2650.0 --> 2655.2
global

2652.319 --> 2657.119
starts rotating in one direction you

2655.2 --> 2658.7999999999997
turn around oh they they turn in the

2657.119 --> 2664.2400000000002
other direction

2658.8 --> 2666.48
no no you just turned around right

2664.24 --> 2666.4799999999996
it's

2667.04 --> 2672.4
like seriously a five-year-old could

2669.839 --> 2674.0789999999997
very quickly and permanently figure that

2672.4 --> 2677.839
out

2674.079 --> 2677.8390000000004
if they haven't been trained

2679.04 --> 2682.48
to think like a baller

2686.64 --> 2691.839
do a great show oh thank you don't have

2688.64 --> 2691.839
to be here i appreciate that

2697.52 --> 2705.0
i'm not a member of

2699.2 --> 2705.0
kum bakka clan i don't know what that is

2706.4 --> 2712.8
it appears to rotate

2709.119 --> 2712.8
now there's no actual rotation

2713.44 --> 2720.16
but the appearance rotates yes the

2716.56 --> 2722.64
lights do change their position in a

2720.16 --> 2725.96
certain pattern that would be described

2722.64 --> 2725.96
as rotating

2734.319 --> 2738.48
did you know if you had a power enough

2736.72 --> 2740.64
powerful enough telescope you could see

2738.48 --> 2742.64
the back of your own head well ralph

2740.64 --> 2746.64
rodriguez

2742.64 --> 2749.2799999999997
i i can't stop laughing at that concept

2746.64 --> 2751.1189999999997
i know that's originally from rumpus

2749.28 --> 2752.6400000000003
welcome back by the way ralph rodriguez

2751.119 --> 2755.28
haven't seen you in a while

2752.64 --> 2758.16
but that originally romper said that

2755.28 --> 2759.599
and i support that statement

2758.16 --> 2761.52
this is

2759.599 --> 2763.839
i support it

2761.52 --> 2765.599
i know you're ridiculous right

2763.839 --> 2767.599
because

2765.599 --> 2770.079
what if the earth was rectangular

2767.599 --> 2770.079
looping

2770.96 --> 2775.44
well maybe yeah

2772.88 --> 2778.56
maybe you could

2775.44 --> 2781.2000000000003
if the telescope in some fashion could

2778.56 --> 2783.7599999999998
overcome the refraction effects of

2781.2 --> 2786.8799999999997
looking through atmosphere i'm sorry

2783.76 --> 2789.119
through gases the gases of the

2786.88 --> 2791.6800000000003
of the realm

2789.119 --> 2793.359
because the line of sight limit the

2791.68 --> 2795.839
circle of view

2793.359 --> 2798.72
is partially bound

2795.839 --> 2801.359
by refraction because of all the air

2798.72 --> 2803.839
just it compounds

2801.359 --> 2806.319
it builds up and then eventually it you

2803.839 --> 2809.2799999999997
don't light doesn't come through anymore

2806.319 --> 2812.4
it's just a blurry soup

2809.28 --> 2812.4
end of view

2814.48 --> 2818.72
it's very funny because i i could

2816.56 --> 2820.24
reference

2818.72 --> 2822.64
3d

2820.24 --> 2825.7599999999998
game world mechanics in this because

2822.64 --> 2828.8799999999997
they do that too you know how they do it

2825.76 --> 2832.0
there is literally a field of view

2828.88 --> 2834.56
in which things are rendered

2832.0 --> 2836.96
they are calculated for

2834.56 --> 2840.7999999999997
and there's a limit to this and then as

2836.96 --> 2840.8
you move you can sometimes even

2840.88 --> 2848.8
like change the the sliders of this

2845.359 --> 2851.2799999999997
in like the graphics settings

2848.8 --> 2853.599
to make the field of view closer or

2851.28 --> 2856.4
further away so you get more you get to

2853.599 --> 2860.4
see more you could basically

2856.4 --> 2861.52
up the refraction lower the refraction

2860.4 --> 2864.4
blur up

2861.52 --> 2866.319
so you see more or you see less

2864.4 --> 2868.48
if you see less there's less rendering

2866.319 --> 2869.44
and it'll make things faster

2868.48 --> 2872.72
right

2869.44 --> 2876.4
well that's kind of how it works

2872.72 --> 2878.48
you just have an end of you

2876.4 --> 2880.64
and then everything blurs up but if

2878.48 --> 2882.0
there would be some kind of telescope of

2880.64 --> 2884.0
some sort

2882.0 --> 2885.839
well positioned to overcome the

2884.0 --> 2887.68
diffraction effect of looking over the

2885.839 --> 2891.04
flat plane

2887.68 --> 2891.04
then maybe they could

2891.359 --> 2897.5989999999997
overcome that field of fuel limitation

2893.76 --> 2897.599
due to the blur up of the air

2897.839 --> 2903.2
and see itself

2901.28 --> 2906.8
in the distance

2903.2 --> 2908.72
if the earth is rectangular looping

2906.8 --> 2910.1600000000003
it's definitely flat but if the loop

2908.72 --> 2912.64
would be

2910.16 --> 2915.92
linear

2912.64 --> 2918.4
and not weird irregular looked

2915.92 --> 2920.48
curved or something then maybe that is

2918.4 --> 2922.4
technically possible then maybe you

2920.48 --> 2924.64
could actually see

2922.4 --> 2926.839
with this specific telescope that can

2924.64 --> 2930.319
overcome the blur up

2926.839 --> 2933.68
effect circle view then maybe

2930.319 --> 2933.68
it could see itself

2934.16 --> 2941.48
another way to try this would be to have

2936.88 --> 2941.48
a giant laser fire in

2942.0 --> 2945.839
past itself

2943.92 --> 2949.04
but yeah we're talking almost like death

2945.839 --> 2952.4
star lasers it's not a favorable thing

2949.04 --> 2955.44
to try out in this world

2952.4 --> 2957.119
just like you have like a giant machine

2955.44 --> 2960.2400000000002
as big as this

2957.119 --> 2962.2400000000002
flat apartment laser that just like make

2960.24 --> 2963.4399999999996
sure it doesn't fire through a mountain

2962.24 --> 2967.04
or something

2963.44 --> 2969.28
high up enough and then just goes

2967.04 --> 2971.839
and then eventually you see the faded

2969.28 --> 2973.8390000000004
beam move past it

2971.839 --> 2977.44
right you don't actually want to aim at

2973.839 --> 2979.599
yourself that that would be ridiculous

2977.44 --> 2982.0
that could also be a way to sort of like

2979.599 --> 2984.48
prove it's looping but i think

2982.0 --> 2987.44
that yeah firing a giant laser is not

2984.48 --> 2987.44
going to be something that

2987.599 --> 2992.2400000000002
is going to be a favorable thing to just

2990.079 --> 2994.96
to figure out the loop

2992.24 --> 2996.24
if you know what i mean

2994.96 --> 3000.23
maybe

2996.24 --> 3003.2889999999998
a powerful enough radar could do it too

3000.23 --> 3003.289
[Music]

3006.16 --> 3010.319
anyway

3008.48 --> 3013.04
that's all under the condition by the

3010.319 --> 3015.68
way that the realm is looping that it

3013.04 --> 3016.8
actually does have a looping

3015.68 --> 3020.2
element

3016.8 --> 3020.2000000000003
to its setup

3033.28 --> 3039.96
i def no i still don't know what that is

3036.48 --> 3039.96
lunato br

3041.76 --> 3044.76
seriously

3066.09 --> 3069.1490000000003
[Music]

3072.45 --> 3075.66
[Music]

3081.37 --> 3086.48
[Music]

3083.76 --> 3088.7200000000003
it's just a joke with glovers

3086.48 --> 3090.559
well look the whole thing about oh you

3088.72 --> 3091.7599999999998
could see yourself in the back of the

3090.559 --> 3094.88
head

3091.76 --> 3094.88
that was based on

3094.96 --> 3099.04
further convolution from the globals and

3097.04 --> 3101.359
that is the assumption of terrestrial

3099.04 --> 3104.16
refraction so they believe they can

3101.359 --> 3106.88
actually see the back of their own head

3104.16 --> 3111.5589999999997
standing on a ball right that's the

3106.88 --> 3111.559
really ridiculous part about it

3112.0 --> 3116.72
they think that terrestrial refraction

3113.92 --> 3119.28
will literally bend the light

3116.72 --> 3122.0
back onto themselves on the back that's

3119.28 --> 3124.559
the real ridiculous thing

3122.0 --> 3127.44
i just when it came up originally i was

3124.559 --> 3129.44
just like yeah yeah that's exactly what

3127.44 --> 3130.96
would happen on the rectangular looping

3129.44 --> 3133.2000000000003
system and everybody's like what the

3130.96 --> 3134.559
[ __ ] is arwen talking about

3133.2 --> 3136.96
ah

3134.559 --> 3140.1600000000003
you're trolling right arwen no i'm like

3136.96 --> 3140.16
yes and no

3148.96 --> 3153.839
does nathan and her kiwi think your

3150.48 --> 3153.839
looping theory is possible

3157.44 --> 3162.559
well i think that they know i'm pretty

3159.839 --> 3166.64
serious about it by now

3162.559 --> 3169.6800000000003
they're not accepting it because it

3166.64 --> 3172.48
it begs the question of the looping in

3169.68 --> 3174.72
itself right

3172.48 --> 3178.0
until it can be proven it's really a

3174.72 --> 3178.0
bizarre thing to assume

3178.16 --> 3180.3999999999996
because

3179.359 --> 3182.319
yeah

3180.4 --> 3184.2400000000002
because i guess something in the

3182.319 --> 3188.079
direction of physicality assumption wise

3184.24 --> 3190.0789999999997
you assume everything is as as it seems

3188.079 --> 3191.44
and everything seems quite euclidian

3190.079 --> 3194.4
around us

3191.44 --> 3195.2000000000003
in a direct environment sense

3194.4 --> 3197.04
so

3195.2 --> 3198.3999999999996
i don't think they're really with me on

3197.04 --> 3201.04
that theory

3198.4 --> 3203.599
but i think that they're

3201.04 --> 3206.16
they've heard enough about it from me by

3203.599 --> 3208.7200000000003
now to realize that

3206.16 --> 3211.359
i might be on to something and it's

3208.72 --> 3211.359
definitely

3211.52 --> 3214.24
structured

3214.48 --> 3220.4
it's not just weird pha level sci-fi

3217.76 --> 3223.5200000000004
blabbering although nathan sometimes

3220.4 --> 3226.2400000000002
does kind of like treat me like that

3223.52 --> 3227.52
when i bring it up in a show

3226.24 --> 3230.9599999999996
but that's probably because it just

3227.52 --> 3230.96
doesn't feel like going there

3232.0 --> 3235.28
and he doesn't always do that

3235.76 --> 3239.7200000000003
hey she can still water

3264.319 --> 3266.5589999999997
what

3266.72 --> 3271.2
does qe really it

3269.28 --> 3275.8390000000004
raccoons what are you

3271.2 --> 3281.48
saying you mean eat with e-a

3275.839 --> 3281.48
crying out loud i don't know

3313.52 --> 3318.4
dude if he wants to eat raccoons then go

3316.24 --> 3320.24
ahead i don't think they'd be very tasty

3318.4 --> 3323.04
though it all depends you know if

3320.24 --> 3325.2
they're like wild raccoons maybe

3323.04 --> 3328.96
they're city raccoons dude

3325.2 --> 3330.72
raccoons eat trash

3328.96 --> 3332.96
you know

3330.72 --> 3335.04
i wouldn't be too eager to start like

3332.96 --> 3337.04
hunting for

3335.04 --> 3338.96
like city raccoons or whatever like

3337.04 --> 3341.92
outskirt

3338.96 --> 3344.0
of the city raccoons

3341.92 --> 3347.88
for my food

3344.0 --> 3347.88
or raccoons in general

3348.559 --> 3351.92
i don't know

3350.96 --> 3356.359
yo

3351.92 --> 3356.359
roadkill that's disgusting dude

3372.079 --> 3379.28
but yeah dude like

3374.16 --> 3379.2799999999997
if you're like a survivalist type

3379.599 --> 3383.599
a lot of them do kind of like eventually

3382.0 --> 3387.68
learn to like

3383.599 --> 3391.04
oh no i can only eat dare or

3387.68 --> 3394.48
swine now eventually yeah

3391.04 --> 3397.599
you're just like okay now i have to eat

3394.48 --> 3399.92
something and yeah maybe

3397.599 --> 3401.599
if i was hungry enough in the wilds i

3399.92 --> 3404.559
would shoot a raccoon if i had the

3401.599 --> 3407.04
opportunity and then

3404.559 --> 3409.6800000000003
eat it i don't know

3407.04 --> 3411.119
maybe yeah as a survivalist you would go

3409.68 --> 3413.44
there

3411.119 --> 3413.44
you know

3416.4 --> 3423.119
but in general now

3419.52 --> 3423.119
coons are kind of trash eaters

3424.96 --> 3430.76
like pork hind

3427.76 --> 3430.76
what

3439.2 --> 3442.0789999999997
chicken feet

3443.599 --> 3448.799
what

3445.76 --> 3448.7990000000004
you mean chicken legs

3456.799 --> 3464.119
i don't think she actually eats the the

3459.599 --> 3464.119
literal feet that's disgusting

3488.88 --> 3491.28
ew

3491.76 --> 3496.599
can we not talk about that thanks

3521.2 --> 3524.2
so

3535.76 --> 3539.48
la palma volcano

3546.0 --> 3552.04
is that the same that went off like a

3548.48 --> 3552.04
few weeks ago

3566.32 --> 3572.8990000000003
[Music]

3600.0 --> 3606.16
okay slow on moogie

3602.319 --> 3606.16
i guess she's kind of roman then

3606.4 --> 3609.6800000000003
autel's noses

3612.319 --> 3615.48
i said

3616.96 --> 3621.839
yeah the life of brian

3620.0 --> 3623.92
that's what makes me think about like

3621.839 --> 3628.04
why would you eat all that crap this

3623.92 --> 3628.04
it's just disgusting

3637.119 --> 3641.079
i'm gonna look it up

3641.42 --> 3644.579
[Applause]

3649.57 --> 3655.2400000000002
[Applause]

3652.24 --> 3655.24
uh

3668.319 --> 3674.079
ah transcript

3671.68 --> 3676.16
oh yeah lock tongs

3674.079 --> 3677.3590000000004
wrench livers

3676.16 --> 3681.44

tuscany fried bats

3696.0 --> 3700.839
oh my god

3697.52 --> 3700.839
so disgusting

3741.2 --> 3745.1189999999997
for tendon health right

3745.599 --> 3748.7200000000003
right right right but yeah slow mo moon

3747.599 --> 3750.1600000000003
buggy

3748.72 --> 3752.72
that's

3750.16 --> 3754.3999999999996
that's the ironic thing though because

3752.72 --> 3757.7599999999998
like those

3754.4 --> 3759.44
things contain like collagen

3757.76 --> 3762.1600000000003
a lot

3759.44 --> 3766.039
it's just not something that i really

3762.16 --> 3766.0389999999998
would prefer to eat

3769.839 --> 3774.799
now on the other hand one thing that can

3771.839 --> 3776.319
be extremely good is

3774.799 --> 3779.0389999999998
basically

3776.319 --> 3781.2
chicken bone not to eat it but to cook

3779.039 --> 3781.2000000000003
it

3781.359 --> 3785.839
cook it really hard super disgusting by

3783.76 --> 3787.2000000000003
the way make sure you you vent it

3785.839 --> 3790.72
properly

3787.2 --> 3790.72
or like everything's gonna stink

3790.799 --> 3795.2
but yeah bone broth

3793.2 --> 3797.5989999999997
from chicken bones

3795.2 --> 3800.24
that would accomplish something very

3797.599 --> 3802.48
similar it also will have the collagen

3800.24 --> 3804.3999999999996
in it

3802.48 --> 3808.559
right so there is something to it it's

3804.4 --> 3811.559
just like why would you like ooh yummy

3808.559 --> 3811.559
yuck

3816.319 --> 3822.4
but if you can make it into a broth

3820.16 --> 3823.5989999999997
big on collagen yeah yeah but hey it has

3822.4 --> 3827.599
a function

3823.599 --> 3827.599
right it is actually really good

3828.16 --> 3835.1189999999997
like people that do that do get stronger

3832.24 --> 3839.0789999999997
bones and ligaments it is true

3835.119 --> 3839.079
it's just like disgusting

3845.119 --> 3851.44
jello

3847.119 --> 3853.839
it's made from animal not not all of it

3851.44 --> 3856.4
some it can also be made of fruit so it

3853.839 --> 3858.72
all depends if it's uh what's it called

3856.4 --> 3858.7200000000003
again

3861.839 --> 3866.96
gelatin

3864.16 --> 3869.68
is made of animal bone

3866.96 --> 3873.039
pig bone i think even

3869.68 --> 3875.0389999999998
and then there's another

3873.039 --> 3879.7990000000004
other form of it and that's plant-based

3875.039 --> 3879.7990000000004
what's the difference again the name

3900.72 --> 3902.9599999999996
i

3902.079 --> 3905.6800000000003
can't

3902.96 --> 3908.7200000000003
can't get to the right word

3905.68 --> 3912.0389999999998
need stronger bones osteoporosis ooh

3908.72 --> 3912.0389999999998
that sucks

3928.319 --> 3935.119
right dude i'd go for

3932.16 --> 3937.52
high dosages of bone broth like

3935.119 --> 3939.359
seriously get bone broth that's exactly

3937.52 --> 3942.4
what you need

3939.359 --> 3942.4
just to kind of

3942.72 --> 3945.0389999999998
stop that

3944.0 --> 3947.44
right

3945.039 --> 3950.559
so in the old days

3947.44 --> 3953.2000000000003
witches very old witches would just make

3950.559 --> 3955.599
that [ __ ] constantly

3953.2 --> 3957.4399999999996
like they just start cooking bones

3955.599 --> 3958.88
everybody's like ew

3957.44 --> 3961.359
what are you doing with all these bones

3958.88 --> 3963.119
well you stink so bad

3961.359 --> 3964.48
but they do it

3963.119 --> 3969.799
to

3964.48 --> 3969.799
to counteract things like osteoporosis

3975.119 --> 3978.4
so i definitely recommend you try some

3977.44 --> 3981.96
of that

3978.4 --> 3981.96
look in that direction

4010.48 --> 4017.839
oxtail yeah yeah that could that also

4014.799 --> 4021.119
but that's because oxtail is basically

4017.839 --> 4023.0389999999998
like concentrated marrow and all that

4021.119 --> 4027.52
yeah

4023.039 --> 4027.5200000000004
it tastes it can it can

4027.68 --> 4034.2
if you get the right herbs and all that

4030.16 --> 4034.2
and it was a healthy ox

4045.839 --> 4049.92
coins are made of mostly protein yeah

4047.44 --> 4052.319
but it's mo look it's not even about the

4049.92 --> 4054.96
bone it's not like the bone itself is

4052.319 --> 4058.5589999999997
going to dissolve

4054.96 --> 4061.119
in the cooking process no it's about

4058.559 --> 4065.2400000000002
the marrow mostly

4061.119 --> 4065.2400000000002
that's the part that you need

4126.08 --> 4129.64
hmm

4126.42 --> 4129.64
[Music]

4131.279 --> 4136.2390000000005
okay interesting seeking star wars horse

4134.0 --> 4136.239
tail

4139.359 --> 4142.359
hmm

4162.719 --> 4165.04
huh

4167.44 --> 4172.799
wow and that's actually an herb that you

4170.319 --> 4175.120000000001
can just buy

4172.799 --> 4179.48
never heard of that or maybe i've heard

4175.12 --> 4179.48
of it and completely forgot again

4211.44 --> 4215.639999999999
oh god damn it

4228.64 --> 4233.12
oh yeah

4230.48 --> 4237.5199999999995
yeah horsetails actually here brought up

4233.12 --> 4237.5199999999995
at natural news i just dove in there

4240.56 --> 4245.84
against osteoporosis that's interesting

4254.48 --> 4257.48
huh

4263.44 --> 4268.799999999999
so yeah maybe combine it

4266.56 --> 4268.8
right

4269.12 --> 4273.84
get some bone broth going and add that

4282.88 --> 4289.0
close psychic psychics

4286.0 --> 4289.0
traveler

4314.48 --> 4317.48
hmm

4356.159 --> 4358.48
wow

4362.56 --> 4366.64
yeah looking through this article there

4364.4 --> 4369.5199999999995
seems to be a lot of

4366.64 --> 4373.12
good things about this horsetail

4369.52 --> 4375.040000000001
like a lot of good things

4373.12 --> 4377.92
supposed to

4375.04 --> 4380.0
reverse diabetes

4377.92 --> 4382.32
prove cognitive function has vitamin k

4380.0 --> 4386.96
in it apparently treats respiratory

4382.32 --> 4389.5199999999995
issues what kidney and liver health

4386.96 --> 4392.4
and even cancer but yeah any everything

4389.52 --> 4392.400000000001
prevents cancer

4393.6 --> 4397.8
as antioxidant interesting

4399.84 --> 4403.679
when i go to the grocery store this

4401.84 --> 4406.88
afternoon i'm gonna look

4403.679 --> 4408.56
in the herbs aisle see if i can

4406.88 --> 4410.08
spot it

4408.56 --> 4412.159000000001
just to try it out

4410.08 --> 4415.64
yeah thank you seeking star order it's a

4412.159 --> 4415.639999999999
very good tip

4445.36 --> 4450.799999999999
good stuff nature provides all you need

4448.159 --> 4450.799999999999
to do is

4451.12 --> 4454.84
know what you need

4468.64 --> 4470.96
hmm

4473.12 --> 4477.36
vitamin d3

4474.719 --> 4477.36
k3

4477.44 --> 4481.159
i thought it was k2

4486.32 --> 4494.28
but yeah the vitamin d3 and k2 i take

4489.679 --> 4494.28
that i've been taking that for

4496.159 --> 4499.759999999999
for almost two years straight

4500.159 --> 4506.32
and the d3 especially with the k2 is

4502.8 --> 4506.320000000001
it's working out great for me

4506.64 --> 4511.360000000001
and i to be honest i even kind of

4508.48 --> 4514.5599999999995
cheated by still taking it in the summer

4511.36 --> 4514.5599999999995
despite the extra sun

4517.12 --> 4522.5599999999995
because it just

4518.8 --> 4525.12
really made me feel good

4522.56 --> 4529.8
like it got the feeling like the sun was

4525.12 --> 4529.8
just shining on me even in the night

4540.719 --> 4545.44
glutathione yeah i heard of that ralph

4542.8 --> 4545.4400000000005
rodriguez

4550.239 --> 4554.879999999999
old hippie vegetarian

4552.64 --> 4556.56
you mean your witch

4554.88 --> 4558.88
it's a witch

4556.56 --> 4560.719
but a good one

4558.88 --> 4563.04
one of those witches that everybody

4560.719 --> 4565.04
needs

4563.04 --> 4568.48
one that just knows everything about

4565.04 --> 4569.679
plants my mother used to be kind of like

4568.48 --> 4570.718999999999
that too but

4569.679 --> 4572.88
yeah

4570.719 --> 4574.96
pharmaceutical

4572.88 --> 4577.96
system got to her in the end

4574.96 --> 4577.96
unfortunately

4590.96 --> 4596.2390000000005
yeah but

4592.4 --> 4596.239
arab knowledge is very valuable

4602.719 --> 4606.96
and i'm pretty sure that the older i get

4604.88 --> 4610.32
the more i will

4606.96 --> 4612.88
like eventually default remember

4610.32 --> 4614.5599999999995
because it's just like learning all the

4612.88 --> 4617.4400000000005
herbs and all the plants and where you

4614.56 --> 4620.4800000000005
can find them that's almost like a

4617.44 --> 4623.839999999999
medical study on its own because it's so

4620.48 --> 4627.04
much so much info

4623.84 --> 4627.04
like this really

4628.4 --> 4633.48
yeah

4629.76 --> 4633.4800000000005
it takes some dedication

4648.0 --> 4654.719
how much d3 of that you know

4651.36 --> 4654.719
i just get standard

4654.96 --> 4658.0
standard kills

4662.4 --> 4666.639999999999
let's just get my basic real green stuff

4665.04 --> 4669.84
it's not the best that's out there but

4666.64 --> 4669.84
it works just fine

4669.92 --> 4672.32
it's just

4672.48 --> 4675.12
just this

4675.52 --> 4680.4800000000005
and then

4677.199 --> 4682.4
take the k the k2 separate

4680.48 --> 4683.44
and how much is

4682.4 --> 4686.679
one

4683.44 --> 4686.678999999999
let's see

4707.36 --> 4709.679
what

4710.48 --> 4712.799999999999
that's

4717.28 --> 4720.96
that's very small letters to start out

4719.6 --> 4726.400000000001
with

4720.96 --> 4729.4
but it's according to this it's 7.5

4726.4 --> 4729.4
micrograms

4731.36 --> 4734.5599999999995
that's not as much as i thought it would

4733.36 --> 4737.679
be

4734.56 --> 4737.679
for such a big thing

4742.48 --> 4745.48
right

4753.36 --> 4756.36
so

4782.56 --> 4785.76
yeah the more you take care of yourself

4784.08 --> 4788.239
now the better off you'll be

4785.76 --> 4790.320000000001
but it's like getting things back right

4788.239 --> 4791.5199999999995
we all

4790.32 --> 4794.48
lose

4791.52 --> 4795.76
everything over our lifetime

4794.48 --> 4798.08
but

4795.76 --> 4800.08
you can just slow it down

4798.08 --> 4804.08
and then even like

4800.08 --> 4807.84
regain things you've lost

4804.08 --> 4807.84
if you just feed yourself well

4808.56 --> 4813.360000000001
yeah if you are

4810.56 --> 4815.92
if you decide to become your own doctor

4813.36 --> 4818.799999999999
and take that very serious

4815.92 --> 4822.0
and learn about how your body works

4818.8 --> 4824.639
specifically in relation to other people

4822.0 --> 4827.12
and be able to fine-tune you the medical

4824.639 --> 4828.0
care that you apply to yourself

4827.12 --> 4830.0
then

4828.0 --> 4835.76
especially the first time you start

4830.0 --> 4835.76
doing that you can just like re-k regain

4836.8 --> 4839.6
levels

4837.84 --> 4842.639
of functioning that you thought that

4839.6 --> 4843.84
were lost forever and then actually hold

4842.639 --> 4847.719
on to them

4843.84 --> 4847.719
much much longer

4852.96 --> 4861.0
right ralph rodriguez yeah it said also

4855.44 --> 4861.0
that the 300 iu yeah

4865.12 --> 4871.76
hello kumo virus

4868.159 --> 4875.638999999999
see you're in a joyous mood i guess we

4871.76 --> 4875.639
we can expect some

4876.159 --> 4882.04
grilling to transpire during fed today

4905.76 --> 4914.0
right oh by the way also a reminder

4910.8 --> 4914.0
so james mason

4915.199 --> 4920.638999999999
about the osteoporosis

4918.48 --> 4923.04
especially for the short run

4920.639 --> 4925.52
or in combination of everything else

4923.04 --> 4927.04
like the horse tail and the

4925.52 --> 4930.320000000001
bone broth

4927.04 --> 4930.32
you might also want to get

4930.639 --> 4933.28
curcuma

4933.84 --> 4937.639
dammit what's the right

4944.53 --> 4947.7
[Applause]

4951.679 --> 4956.4
is there another word turmeric that's it

4954.4 --> 4958.638999999999
you

4956.4 --> 4959.599999999999
you might also want to involve turmeric

4958.639 --> 4962.88
with that

4959.6 --> 4966.400000000001
which in universally also

4962.88 --> 4969.04
is actually very good for bone situation

4966.4 --> 4969.04
and ligaments

4969.52 --> 4974.639
you'd be surprised how acute that

4972.08 --> 4978.32
actually works

4974.639 --> 4981.12
but i i yeah i use that

4978.32 --> 4983.92
i do it in my coffee tumeric coffee

4981.12 --> 4988.5599999999995
i i got this

4983.92 --> 4988.56
this is literally just turmeric juice

4990.239 --> 4996.32
with ginger and chili

4993.92 --> 4997.61
and it's like ah i feel a little stiff

4996.32 --> 4998.719
right look look

4997.61 --> 5001.839999999999
[Music]

4998.719 --> 5001.84
it is gone

5003.199 --> 5007.28
so

5004.639 --> 5010.2390000000005
that would be the the third

5007.28 --> 5011.759999999999
component i would also add

5010.239 --> 5014.0
because it it

5011.76 --> 5015.4400000000005
not only acutely helps for that but it

5014.0 --> 5017.12
also

5015.44 --> 5019.599999999999
basically just makes

5017.12 --> 5019.599999999999
everything

5019.84 --> 5026.88
transfer better so it'll help overall in

5023.36 --> 5029.839999999999
absorption of all the other things right

5026.88 --> 5029.84
more the merrier

5032.88 --> 5037.159000000001
all right i'll be right back two minutes

5119.36 --> 5122.839999999999
turn them back

5126.239 --> 5128.5599999999995
hey

5129.36 --> 5132.239
joe friday

5136.32 --> 5141.84
wow that's

5137.76 --> 5141.84
that's a very long time ago

5154.239 --> 5159.36
like all the way in the beginning

5157.12 --> 5162.84
of the early bird show

5159.36 --> 5162.839999999999
have you been

5207.6 --> 5210.6
hmm

5221.52 --> 5228.56
yeah by the way uh

5225.12 --> 5231.199
my my old skype account kind of broke

5228.56 --> 5231.92
since then

5231.199 --> 5234.719
so

5231.92 --> 5236.88
yeah you have to

5234.719 --> 5241.52
if you want to talk to me over skype

5236.88 --> 5241.52
then get the new skype address

5242.96 --> 5248.08
because the other ones yeah i've

5246.239 --> 5250.959999999999
i lost the technology and it's too

5248.08 --> 5253.199
painful to put it back together again

5250.96 --> 5257.52
i tried

5253.199 --> 5257.5199999999995
but the help desk didn't didn't work

5259.199 --> 5262.719
send me a new one it's i don't have your

5261.679 --> 5265.96
address

5262.719 --> 5265.96
on skype

5278.48 --> 5282.32
yeah belly sunday i know

5287.6 --> 5292.08
but yeah if i'm gonna look on that one

5292.159 --> 5295.839999999999
this doesn't work

5300.8 --> 5306.12
you add me and i'll

5303.12 --> 5306.12
confirm

5313.76 --> 5318.56
had a global tell me the proof of axiom

5316.56 --> 5320.8
rotation

5318.56 --> 5324.2390000000005
what

5320.8 --> 5324.2390000000005
centrifugal force what

5334.4 --> 5338.0
don't you skype it's literally on my mic

5337.12 --> 5341.28
so

5338.0 --> 5341.28
yes so is windows

5342.0 --> 5347.44
and yeah google

5344.719 --> 5350.4800000000005
it's not exactly

5347.44 --> 5352.719
a human friendly company at this point

5350.48 --> 5352.718999999999
so

5353.92 --> 5357.88
i just use what works

5382.239 --> 5388.04
take calcium and combo with vitamin yeah

5384.639 --> 5388.04
that could work

5412.8 --> 5416.8
okay guys

5415.28 --> 5421.84
what are we talking about

5416.8 --> 5421.84
still got like 25 minutes left

5429.679 --> 5434.6
oh wow really said that ralph rodriguez

5434.8 --> 5439.12
so global told you the proof of

5436.56 --> 5440.88
actuation is centrifugal force and then

5439.12 --> 5442.719
when you inquire you said it was

5440.88 --> 5445.1990000000005
negligible

5442.719 --> 5449.0
that's why you don't feel it

5445.199 --> 5449.0
sounds like the guy

5450.32 --> 5454.48
is arguing like an anti-flat earther

5455.84 --> 5459.84
it's like oh yeah it's spinning it's a

5457.84 --> 5463.52
centrifugal force and oh yeah but we

5459.84 --> 5466.639
don't feel any oh really like like we

5463.52 --> 5466.639
don't see the curve

5467.52 --> 5473.280000000001
and like how we're breathing so

5470.08 --> 5475.12
there is the containment etc said yeah

5473.28 --> 5476.719
we know

5475.12 --> 5477.76
or you could just

5476.719 --> 5481.199
stop

5477.76 --> 5485.639
stop it and realize the earth is flat

5481.199 --> 5485.638999999999
and stationary and contained

5494.59 --> 5497.709
[Music]

5500.639 --> 5505.36
centrifugal force counter

5503.44 --> 5507.199
by craft issues

5505.36 --> 5510.719
no

5507.199 --> 5514.28
that's not how forces work even if you

5510.719 --> 5514.28
assume them

5520.719 --> 5525.52
the presupposed gravity wouldn't make

5523.04 --> 5528.32
centrifugal force go away you would

5525.52 --> 5531.679
still be able to measure it

5528.32 --> 5534.5599999999995
right one force doesn't cover up

5531.679 --> 5538.12
another force it just they just move

5534.56 --> 5538.120000000001
through one another

5552.56 --> 5557.120000000001
all right yeah yeah but anyway

5554.239 --> 5560.638999999999
centrifugal force that's all super cute

5557.12 --> 5562.4
in reality though

5560.639 --> 5564.88
there is no spin

5562.4 --> 5566.159
of which the centrifugal force would be

5564.88 --> 5568.56
a side effect

5566.159 --> 5571.199
because if there was a spin of earth

5568.56 --> 5573.6
underneath the galaxy

5571.199 --> 5574.96
then we would see coriolis deviation of

5573.6 --> 5576.8
things

5574.96 --> 5578.88
not attached

5576.8 --> 5582.28
to the spinning earth

5578.88 --> 5582.28
and we don't

5601.44 --> 5604.799999999999
oh

5602.14 --> 5606.56
[Music]

5604.8 --> 5608.400000000001
over the edge

5606.56 --> 5611.04
oh it's over the edge

5608.4 --> 5613.44
the edge

5611.04 --> 5615.5199999999995
oh really but it didn't cross antarctica

5613.44 --> 5617.04
now did it lasky

5615.52 --> 5619.360000000001
rizzling

5617.04 --> 5621.6
it's not a major blow it's not a blow to

5619.36 --> 5624.799999999999
anything

5621.6 --> 5626.08
it doesn't prove the earth is not

5624.8 --> 5626.96
flat

5626.08 --> 5628.639
right

5626.96 --> 5631.6
might prove something about the

5628.639 --> 5633.1990000000005
orientation of the known land masses and

5631.6 --> 5636.320000000001
all that

5633.199 --> 5640.719
it doesn't actually prove a globe

5636.32 --> 5640.719
but of course as you do

5641.199 --> 5648.159
you can still use it to think

5645.679 --> 5650.0
it is proof of a globe

5648.159 --> 5652.239
because if you don't think about it too

5650.0 --> 5654.719
much then you can just take anything and

5652.239 --> 5656.159
say it's against flat earth and pro

5654.719 --> 5658.0
globe like

5656.159 --> 5660.4
if you just don't think about it too

5658.0 --> 5662.159
much it's very easy to just take

5660.4 --> 5664.32
anything and say this proves the earth

5662.159 --> 5668.719
is a globe and it's not flat

5664.32 --> 5668.719
if you just don't think about it i know

5669.36 --> 5673.839999999999
the ae map is wrong

5674.0 --> 5679.12
really it's a projection what's wrong

5676.639 --> 5682.88
about it are you saying the

5679.12 --> 5685.199
the map is projected incorrectly last

5682.88 --> 5686.96
year wrestling are you saying that

5685.199 --> 5689.678999999999
are you saying the map is projected

5686.96 --> 5689.679
incorrectly

5690.32 --> 5695.88
what are the errors within the map

5692.88 --> 5695.88
projection

5705.84 --> 5713.0
or did you not expect an actual question

5709.52 --> 5713.0
about your statement

5714.34 --> 5717.869000000001
[Music]

5735.6 --> 5739.4400000000005
[Music]

5736.96 --> 5741.84
yeah kumu fire yeah you bumping your toe

5739.44 --> 5743.919999999999
on a raised piece of concrete proves

5741.84 --> 5746.0
it's a globe because of terrestrial

5743.92 --> 5748.4
refraction you see

5746.0 --> 5750.48
you were putting your foot there

5748.4 --> 5751.5199999999995
but it wasn't actually where you thought

5750.48 --> 5753.5199999999995
it was

5751.52 --> 5756.400000000001
because of terrestrial refraction so you

5753.52 --> 5758.8
misplaced it so that does prove

5756.4 --> 5761.92
the earth is a globe by anti flutter at

5758.8 --> 5761.92
their standards that's right

5766.96 --> 5772.08
it's not showing the real dimensions of

5770.08 --> 5773.36
earth

5772.08 --> 5776.159
what do you mean

5773.36 --> 5778.96
it's a projection you didn't and you

5776.159 --> 5783.119
didn't get the question did you

5778.96 --> 5786.08
lasky risling i asked you about

5783.119 --> 5789.44
the projection what is incorrect about

5786.08 --> 5792.5599999999995
the map projection

5789.44 --> 5792.5599999999995
the dimensions

5794.4 --> 5798.92
dimensions of earth what

5799.04 --> 5803.84
you're saying it's not euclidean

5802.4 --> 5805.839999999999
accurate

5803.84 --> 5806.8
it's not literal

5805.84 --> 5810.159000000001
it's not

5806.8 --> 5810.84
exactly the way you would look at it at

5810.159 --> 5813.599999999999
the

5810.84 --> 5815.76
map really

5813.6 --> 5819.280000000001
who would have guessed that i mean i've

5815.76 --> 5820.159000000001
been only saying that for five years

5819.28 --> 5821.679
nah

5820.159 --> 5823.759999999999
three years

5821.679 --> 5825.6
not that long

5823.76 --> 5827.76
i had to figure that one out on my own i

5825.6 --> 5829.119000000001
thought that maps were literal at first

5827.76 --> 5830.320000000001
and then i figured oh wait it's a

5829.119 --> 5832.5599999999995
projection

5830.32 --> 5835.679
it's not actually

5832.56 --> 5838.8
the scale none of it is the globe maps

5835.679 --> 5841.28
not the scale

5838.8 --> 5842.8
and the flat map

5841.28 --> 5846.08
map

5842.8 --> 5848.159000000001
projection not euclidean literal

5846.08 --> 5848.96
map projection not the skill yeah we

5848.159 --> 5851.36
know

5848.96 --> 5853.679
we know

5851.36 --> 5855.5199999999995
like to remind you that the globe map is

5853.679 --> 5857.119
also not the scale

5855.52 --> 5858.159000000001
right when you actually put it on the

5857.119 --> 5861.679
globe

5858.159 --> 5862.96
you hover over it in the in the google

5861.679 --> 5865.28
maps

5862.96 --> 5867.28
well guess what you move around oh the

5865.28 --> 5870.8
scale changes yeah that's because that

5867.28 --> 5872.159
projection in its actual globe

5870.8 --> 5875.6
format

5872.159 --> 5876.719
shown to you as a globe is not the scale

5875.6 --> 5879.96
yeah

5876.719 --> 5879.96
i know

5904.0 --> 5911.44
no no you're now you're ignoring

5908.639 --> 5915.04
potentially lying the globe fits no it

5911.44 --> 5917.5199999999995
doesn't i literally just addressed that

5915.04 --> 5920.4
very blatantly

5917.52 --> 5921.679
yeah when you look at the globe it

5920.4 --> 5922.879999999999
doesn't

5921.679 --> 5924.4
fit

5922.88 --> 5926.0
do you hear me it

5924.4 --> 5928.239
doesn't

5926.0 --> 5928.239
fit

5929.76 --> 5937.719
not fitting not the scale not the skill

5932.719 --> 5937.719
means it doesn't fit it's not literal

5940.88 --> 5944.639
yeah

5942.32 --> 5946.88
globe projection

5944.639 --> 5951.28
not to scale

5946.88 --> 5952.8
globe projection not to scale

5951.28 --> 5955.679
no it doesn't

5952.8 --> 5956.88
you want me to demonstrate it

5955.679 --> 5959.119
dumbass

5956.88 --> 5964.679
i will demonstrate it to your dumbass

5959.119 --> 5964.679
again as i have done many many times

5977.119 --> 5980.119
oh

5983.6 --> 5988.679
ah

5985.36 --> 5988.679
let's see

5990.71 --> 5993.869
[Applause]

6000.639 --> 6003.8
all right

6010.56 --> 6013.119000000001
all right

6011.76 --> 6017.159000000001
well

6013.119 --> 6017.159
oh that's just great

6023.04 --> 6026.96
i have to still make it fit the screen

6027.04 --> 6031.04
tiny little screen

6030.0 --> 6035.76
all right

6031.04 --> 6038.08
[Applause]

6035.76 --> 6041.280000000001
so

6038.08 --> 6041.28
let's do some evidence

6043.119 --> 6049.5199999999995
right so you see that

6045.6 --> 6050.88
is it is it visible enough in the corner

6049.52 --> 6053.360000000001
yeah

6050.88 --> 6056.0
the bar over here

6053.36 --> 6060.239
right you see

6056.0 --> 6060.239
i see how wide that bar is

6060.88 --> 6066.96
right

6062.639 --> 6067.76
now let's zoom out oh hey oh what's this

6066.96 --> 6070.4800000000005
hey

6067.76 --> 6072.159000000001
it's not a globe

6070.48 --> 6075.879999999999
what is this

6072.159 --> 6075.879999999999
how can that be

6079.199 --> 6081.839999999999
oh

6080.48 --> 6084.159
but even

6081.84 --> 6086.8
in this projection it's not entirely to

6084.159 --> 6089.44
scale see how it changes

6086.8 --> 6091.6
no map is the scale

6089.44 --> 6093.36
but i would like to kind of see the the

6091.6 --> 6096.4800000000005
globe

6093.36 --> 6096.48
projection i didn't get

6097.6 --> 6100.4800000000005
why it's not

6101.36 --> 6105.28
showing a globe

6103.44 --> 6106.96
this is new

6105.28 --> 6109.199
like why

6106.96 --> 6110.719
what

6109.199 --> 6113.28
i thought google maps would always be

6110.719 --> 6113.28
the globe

6113.679 --> 6118.159
this is weird

6116.239 --> 6120.4
let's go to this oh did you see that

6118.159 --> 6123.199
bend

6120.4 --> 6123.199
did you see that

6127.119 --> 6133.28
did did you see it unfold right there

6130.639 --> 6135.52
it unfolded like from a spherical

6133.28 --> 6137.92
projection

6135.52 --> 6141.4400000000005
but i don't know why it doesn't show

6137.92 --> 6143.04
that sphere though i don't get it

6141.44 --> 6146.678999999999
why is it not being presented in

6143.04 --> 6146.679
spherical format

6160.32 --> 6164.32
apparently this is what it's like

6162.239 --> 6165.759999999999
according to nasa

6164.32 --> 6168.48
sp what the

6165.76 --> 6168.4800000000005
get out of here

6169.76 --> 6175.6
imagery 2021 copyrighted nasa map data

6173.44 --> 6178.0
2021 yeah

6175.6 --> 6181.76
damn it [ __ ] off pop-up

6178.0 --> 6181.76
but yeah i don't know why it

6184.48 --> 6189.48
why

6186.159 --> 6189.48
it's not

6190.88 --> 6197.92
spherical i have no idea why

6194.88 --> 6199.92
i did this recently changed

6197.92 --> 6202.88
or there is some weird setting thing

6199.92 --> 6202.88
that i don't know about

6203.36 --> 6207.679
anyway yeah this is

6205.52 --> 6209.76
that's yeah i thought that i guess i'm

6207.679 --> 6211.679
not going to demonstrate it

6209.76 --> 6215.639
although yeah there is skill scaling

6211.679 --> 6215.639
issues even on this one

6225.28 --> 6228.88
isn't google maps based on the global

6227.04 --> 6230.96
yeah yeah but that's the whole point

6228.88 --> 6233.04
bobby steals

6230.96 --> 6237.28
to demonstrate that even when it is

6233.04 --> 6237.28
presented as a globe it's not skill but

6238.159 --> 6241.839999999999
for some reason

6239.92 --> 6244.8
it's not

6241.84 --> 6247.84
it's not being presented in the in globe

6244.8 --> 6247.84
fashion now

6251.44 --> 6255.32
i don't know why

6264.56 --> 6269.1990000000005
i mean it's it's always been presented

6266.8 --> 6269.1990000000005
like that

6270.719 --> 6274.92
it it isn't now

6284.56 --> 6291.04
hello old man pilky

6288.159 --> 6293.28
google earth okay i guess i'll try that

6291.04 --> 6293.28
then

6293.91 --> 6297.59
[Applause]

6301.44 --> 6307.239
oh my god no

6304.239 --> 6307.239
stupid

6328.0 --> 6331.0
ah

6331.44 --> 6337.119
all right yeah

6334.32 --> 6337.119
that should work

6337.36 --> 6341.239
okay let's try again

6363.199 --> 6368.4
all right so here we are

6366.8 --> 6371.400000000001
oh can you see

6368.4 --> 6371.4
what

6377.76 --> 6381.92
okay let's let's go

6380.639 --> 6384.32
let's

6381.92 --> 6387.84
just do a scale of something like this

6384.32 --> 6389.44
400 kilometers for this width

6387.84 --> 6392.0
let's move

6389.44 --> 6394.96
oh oh see it's already changing it's

6392.0 --> 6394.96
going back and forth

6398.56 --> 6402.8
why is it constantly going back and

6400.48 --> 6402.799999999999
forth

6409.44 --> 6412.44
what

6416.56 --> 6421.159000000001
okay

6417.36 --> 6421.159
there's something changed

6429.44 --> 6432.159
that's weird

6433.92 --> 6438.56
hey this is earth turned on inside what

6436.159 --> 6438.5599999999995
is this

6440.96 --> 6447.04
but yeah there's something changed

6443.28 --> 6447.04
so this is not the same reading

6447.44 --> 6453.678999999999
they i think they warped this projection

6450.32 --> 6453.679
in a very weird way

6453.84 --> 6457.84
so this is completely different

6468.84 --> 6473.28
whoa

6470.48 --> 6473.28
what's going on

6474.48 --> 6480.0
ah

6475.76 --> 6480.0
this is weird orientating on this thing

6481.44 --> 6488.239
but yeah the scale bar is kind of [ __ ]

6485.679 --> 6491.76
and besides

6488.239 --> 6493.759999999999
this united states size

6491.76 --> 6499.08
this

6493.76 --> 6499.08
antarctica supposedly don't think so

6508.08 --> 6513.04
whatever they did

6509.6 --> 6515.280000000001
the scale bar is completely useless in

6513.04 --> 6517.28
this system and i mean completely

6515.28 --> 6522.0
useless it's not

6517.28 --> 6522.0
even remotely showing what it used to

6522.4 --> 6527.04
so i guess that

6524.08 --> 6529.28
fixed their little issue

6527.04 --> 6529.28
then

6529.6 --> 6535.280000000001
that's why probably they took it out of

6532.48 --> 6539.48
the actual google maps

6535.28 --> 6539.48
can't do that anymore there

6542.08 --> 6544.32
oh

6545.36 --> 6548.36
what

6554.32 --> 6558.36
this looks really different

6571.04 --> 6576.4
oh

6573.36 --> 6576.4
it's interesting though

6577.52 --> 6582.400000000001
seems to be a little more revealed on

6579.92 --> 6583.84
this

6582.4 --> 6586.638999999999
details

6583.84 --> 6589.4400000000005
that's the first time i'm seeing that

6586.639 --> 6589.4400000000005
anything of that

6594.88 --> 6598.32
anyway

6596.96 --> 6600.639
yeah

6598.32 --> 6604.639
the skill demonstration

6600.639 --> 6606.88
definitely did not work out

6604.639 --> 6610.1990000000005
oh well there's nothing i can really do

6606.88 --> 6610.1990000000005
about it

6614.96 --> 6620.0
google maps into globe fuel layers more

6617.679 --> 6623.35
global okay okay i'll try that out then

6620.0 --> 6626.529
thanks for the tip

6623.35 --> 6626.529
[Applause]

6631.36 --> 6635.839999999999
get

6633.28 --> 6635.84
layers

6636.159 --> 6639.159
more

6639.92 --> 6642.8
globe view

6643.119 --> 6647.44
zoom i didn't see it ah there it is

6646.4 --> 6649.36
thank you

6647.44 --> 6651.119
wow that looks shitty but

6649.36 --> 6653.839999999999
that's fine

6651.119 --> 6653.839999999999
so

6656.8 --> 6663.320000000001
what

6658.88 --> 6663.32
no they changed it here too

6671.44 --> 6677.759999999999
so something has dramatically changed in

6674.239 --> 6680.08
the way that they've built this

6677.76 --> 6682.400000000001
because their dos doesn't seem to be any

6680.08 --> 6684.32
more scaling issues whatsoever and i

6682.4 --> 6687.679
have it on record guys

6684.32 --> 6687.679
it's on my shows

6690.32 --> 6693.96
let me show you

6694.88 --> 6697.4400000000005
so yeah

6701.36 --> 6705.5199999999995
no more scaling issues at all

6705.76 --> 6711.159000000001
in the sense that it's not registered

6708.159 --> 6711.159
anymore

6723.28 --> 6727.119
see

6724.32 --> 6731.04
it completely stays unaltered it

6727.119 --> 6734.96
literally does not move at all

6731.04 --> 6737.5199999999995
and it was on record that it used to

6734.96 --> 6740.32
on that same glow projection

6737.52 --> 6744.159000000001
rolling around at the same height

6740.32 --> 6744.159
so something's changed

6747.44 --> 6750.48
hey

6748.8 --> 6753.04
i did switch a little

6750.48 --> 6753.04
see that

6753.599 --> 6757.4400000000005
no

6755.28 --> 6760.719
no it's the freaking text constantly

6757.44 --> 6764.759999999999
bumping back and forth beside it

6760.719 --> 6764.76
the length is not changing

6767.119 --> 6770.28
all right

6778.159 --> 6783.598999999999
i'm gonna round out the show because fvd

6780.719 --> 6783.599
is starting soon

6784.0 --> 6789.36
i think i'm gonna bring it up there too

6786.8 --> 6789.360000000001
weird man

6789.52 --> 6794.56
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6792.0 --> 6796.8
