good to see you all

189.97 --> 204.16
William be call so off man

198.88 --> 207.57999999999998
I've been up very late this time it was

204.16 --> 208.48
a Bible literalist that actually kept me

207.58 --> 210.82000000000002
happy

208.48 --> 219.64
there were all kinds of hangouts going

210.82 --> 223.15
and yeah apparently Martin Lydia Martin

219.64 --> 226.48
lead his main channel was well he kind

223.15 --> 227.769
of like made a big oops by panicking

226.48 --> 230.44
yeah

227.769 --> 233.56
it it's always so annoying when somebody

230.44 --> 234.43
Falls for it because I guess a lot of us

233.56 --> 236.799
have made

234.43 --> 239.43900000000002
one of those types of mistakes at least

236.799 --> 242.92000000000002
once in our lives I have like two years

239.439 --> 245.62
ago was very annoying luckily I kind of

242.92 --> 247.78
caught on halfway so the damage wasn't

245.62 --> 253.12
too extensive I just had to reinstall my

247.78 --> 256.63
computer but yeah it is technically well

253.12 --> 259.78000000000003
it is not it is not hacked through

256.63 --> 264.78
hacking tools remotely it is just it is

259.78 --> 264.78
scammed it is more like a scam hack

265.41 --> 275.22900000000004
tricking somebody in giving you access

267.88 --> 280.33
and yeah it's sad and I wonder if

275.229 --> 284.62
YouTube can do something about it anyway

280.33 --> 288.69899999999996
after that or like in the end by the

284.62 --> 291.039
literalist went live and I watched a lot

288.699 --> 294.94
of that was extremely interesting very

291.039 --> 299.13
much I don't know if it's coincidental

294.94 --> 302.8
but just the subject she dealt with I

299.13 --> 307.02
felt very much like that was relevant to

302.8 --> 307.02000000000004
the things that I'm dealing with and I

307.139 --> 313.659
don't know there's something Paul is

310.72 --> 326.40900000000005
just crushing it recently I think she

313.659 --> 332.74
really is a Resta i doing also been Owen

326.409 --> 337.139
Benjamin also and yeah I was just

332.74 --> 340.57
watching yesterday's show and got up to

337.139 --> 342.81
41 minutes but it's just tough it's hard

340.57 --> 345.71
to step away from

342.81 --> 351.5
[Music]

345.71 --> 351.5
so much good things to watch out there

361.37 --> 367.52
anyway yeah he's talking about merchants

364.43 --> 374.26
of despair basically and fear porn in

367.52 --> 374.26
all its fashions and it's just spot-on

379.52 --> 386.63
and I think I person I have I'm not

384.08 --> 391.50899999999996
gonna ask my public I have stepped away

386.63 --> 395.87
from that right as far as I know like I

391.509 --> 398.69
for a while every time some something

395.87 --> 401.8
like that comes up I really my first

398.69 --> 404.99
priority is to just point out what is

401.8 --> 408.139
the fair porn aspect potentially about

404.99 --> 410.75
it and what it could really be down to

408.139 --> 415.55
earth and where it could lead to to

410.75 --> 418.34
basically dispel that oversimplification

415.55 --> 421.28000000000003
fear spell that usually comes with a lot

418.34 --> 431.13899999999995
of these things I do my best to do that

421.28 --> 431.13899999999995
I hope you guys and gals agree

438.49 --> 443.86
Mudd what is that

449.77 --> 451.79999999999995
I

452.3 --> 462.27000000000004
Oshin okay it's supposed to be a wave

455.43 --> 466.5
right weird kind of handy that you can

462.27 --> 469.95
go over with your mice mouse pointer and

466.5 --> 474.12
now you can see it as well and literally

469.95 --> 483.5
see what it's supposed to mean as it

474.12 --> 489.419
were but yeah that's kind of handy

483.5 --> 494.33
anyway right oh sure

489.419 --> 497.43
oh six I say good morning because I'm

494.33 --> 501.5
technically addressing the American

497.43 --> 510.93
audience because to them it's really

501.5 --> 513.11
early morning and technically this show

510.93 --> 517.5600000000001
was kind of meant as a breakfast show

513.11 --> 520.53
with guests would be good and I have had

517.56 --> 523.3489999999999
yes although sometimes it just turns out

520.53 --> 528.6899999999999
really chaotic and maybe it's something

523.349 --> 532.35
about me that in a way for me it's more

528.69 --> 535.98
difficult to keep a show fluid with one

532.35 --> 539.4
on one as a show host because I'm really

535.98 --> 543.1800000000001
good at kind of like just taking a seat

539.4 --> 546.24
somewhere and supporting that show but

543.18 --> 549.8389999999999
to actually be directing it myself

546.24 --> 555.48
yeah the problem is with the way that I

549.839 --> 557.4000000000001
reason how to think about things I it

555.48 --> 559.8000000000001
takes up a lot of my concentration I

557.4 --> 561.6899999999999
really tend to dig really deep and it

559.8 --> 565.77
takes a lot of focus and that kind of

561.69 --> 567.75
also disturbs my oversight in in keeping

565.77 --> 570.3
the flow for the show going because that

567.75 --> 573.18
really does require kind of a separate

570.3 --> 576.8
constant view on that it doesn't really

573.18 --> 576.8
work well at the same time

587.4 --> 590.5799999999999
[Music]

591.5 --> 603.91
yeah don't elves prefer the company of

595.61 --> 603.91
just other elves well don't all

603.94 --> 611.4100000000001
conscious humans basically prefer the

607.58 --> 615.4300000000001
company of people that understand them

611.41 --> 619.76
that get them that have the same

615.43 --> 622.6999999999999
feelings about about many things so they

619.76 --> 624.62
share that and can talk about that and

622.7 --> 627.5200000000001
reflect upon that together isn't that

624.62 --> 631.63
just natural to all human beings

627.52 --> 631.63
including elves whatever

647.92 --> 657.91
all right sounds kind of weird but to me

651.519 --> 663.569
it's Jason just went live again he seems

657.91 --> 666.04
to be taking up my time slug don't know

663.569 --> 669.449
I'm happy about that but oh well

666.04 --> 669.449
probably didn't think about that

670.169 --> 681.179
yes mud I'm considering elves to be

676.319 --> 681.179
human beings that's right

685.31 --> 688.4699999999999
[Music]

694.9 --> 703.4399999999999
you do realize that we as humans

700.6 --> 706.4200000000001
generally have a tendency to start

703.44 --> 709.7800000000001
calling other people especially when

706.42 --> 713.62
they misbehave we start the stereotype

709.78 --> 716.14
certain fantastical creatures like

713.62 --> 722.5
goblins or trolls you do realize that

716.14 --> 726.22
that's already going on well there's

722.5 --> 728.97
other ways to also designate people in a

726.22 --> 728.97
positive way

734.91 --> 743.73
and I don't know from my perspective

738.24 --> 746.13
elves are this is just my personal what

743.73 --> 748.26
I took for it as I was young from the

746.13 --> 750.36
from the fiction from Lord of the Rings

748.26 --> 758.64
and all that the elves yeah that's quite

750.36 --> 762.24
extraordinary as it were but just the

758.64 --> 769.3199999999999
way elves are are very very conscious

762.24 --> 771.6
and they just know things coming like

769.32 --> 775.5
their awareness is very high and that's

771.6 --> 779.16
always what just like the thing is also

775.5 --> 781.65
that it is kind of described and I see

779.16 --> 784.3199999999999
it and there may be a lot of people that

781.65 --> 787.86
just don't recognize it and they just

784.32 --> 789.33
see other elements about them and I

787.86 --> 791.79
think that that is their main

789.33 --> 796.1700000000001
characteristics well I for me it was

791.79 --> 800.36
their just their conscious they they

796.17 --> 800.36
just understood so what they were

804.18 --> 809.55
yeah just it kind of like wisdom they

807.33 --> 813.96
had an amazing wisdom not necessarily

809.55 --> 817.7099999999999
intelligence and they limited their

813.96 --> 820.4100000000001
creativity also but with disciplines of

817.71 --> 825.24
music and they were very disciplined all

820.41 --> 828.03
the elves and I think that cult read the

825.24 --> 832.82
idea behind that is also because that is

828.03 --> 838.31
required I said it myself as you ascend

832.82 --> 843.1800000000001
in consciousness you have more of your

838.31 --> 844.92
base nature to confront you you know it

843.18 --> 846.9599999999999
will start to conflict with you your ego

844.92 --> 849.27
will start to try to get in your way

846.96 --> 851.49
more the more you get conscious and

849.27 --> 856.4399999999999
discipline is the only real answer to

851.49 --> 860.97
that and that is incorporated within the

856.44 --> 869.1800000000001
culture of the elves in in Tolkien's

860.97 --> 869.1800000000001
word head Wars

881.22 --> 891.45
yes doc Michael look and my my family

888.73 --> 897.46
was just like that

891.45 --> 900.3100000000001
my mother really thought at times well

897.46 --> 902.83
look my mother had was a real liberal

900.31 --> 904.7199999999999
minded person that would just adapt to a

902.83 --> 908.98
lot of ways of thinking and then just

904.72 --> 912.089
not really pick one but she really got

908.98 --> 915.37
the elves as well that's also why she

912.089 --> 918.3100000000001
named me after one why she gave me that

915.37 --> 923.5
middle name of our winner that's really

918.31 --> 930.3389999999999
my name it's real and she was basically

923.5 --> 933.45
brilliant a brilliant mind concerning

930.339 --> 937.74
music at a great hearing and a good

933.45 --> 942.279
effective teacher and and composer

937.74 --> 944.85
Chelsea was like a bard for me like

942.279 --> 944.85
really

945.74 --> 954.14
in that way like it well I like an Alf

949.1 --> 957.1700000000001
yeah elves have music and teaching and

954.14 --> 959.48
knowledge and insight and wisdom and

957.17 --> 962.3299999999999
that's all about and my mother was also

959.48 --> 965.96
about that unfortunately though her own

962.33 --> 967.4300000000001
personal character did not have a lot of

965.96 --> 969.83
talent for discipline

967.43 --> 974.4499999999999
she would have a lot of discipline

969.83 --> 979.4300000000001
concerning her craft music perfect

974.45 --> 981.08
discipline like she a good teacher you

979.43 --> 985.13
know a really good teacher by wedding

981.08 --> 988.73
concern to her out life oh my god she

985.13 --> 993.37
was a well liberal mess as that would be

988.73 --> 996.62
designated right now and and not so well

993.37 --> 999.11
yeah kind of screaming in public I

996.62 --> 1004.48
almost feared to think what would happen

999.11 --> 1008.5
if she that's this sounds horrible but

1004.48 --> 1010.12
if she would have lived okay and who

1008.5 --> 1012.24
knows where how what would have become

1010.12 --> 1015.22
of everything in me and I don't know and

1012.24 --> 1017.41
she would go on media man she would

1015.22 --> 1021.46
probably be one of those terrible social

1017.41 --> 1025.17
justice warrior moms I think she would

1021.46 --> 1031.1200000000001
probably would have become that this

1025.17 --> 1033.8700000000001
anyway so but it all started out pretty

1031.12 --> 1033.87
gloriously

1038.589 --> 1046.779
I think that her sensitivity which was

1042.549 --> 1049.72
is also where I inherited mine from like

1046.779 --> 1052.929
sensitive nature also means that things

1049.72 --> 1055.84
hurt a lot and when she basically

1052.929 --> 1059.679
figured out that her dream of my dad who

1055.84 --> 1062.529
she was just really in love with or our

1059.679 --> 1064.3890000000001
life just like I typically am really in

1062.529 --> 1067.69
love with the ones that I go into a

1064.389 --> 1069.879
relationship with and when it really

1067.69 --> 1071.919
became apparent that my dad kind of lost

1069.879 --> 1080.86
interest and was kind of hanging around

1071.919 --> 1086.47
just for me then it kind of fractured

1080.86 --> 1090.129
her it it really broke her bad it turned

1086.47 --> 1093.19
her sour and and that blue that was

1090.129 --> 1096.879
going on for like ten years and it was a

1093.19 --> 1099.19
lot of arguing and fighting and they

1096.879 --> 1101.4699999999998
would still kind of try but it would

1099.19 --> 1103.8990000000001
never like there's something got in

1101.47 --> 1107.169
between and it never really meant it

1103.899 --> 1108.85
and yeah after that it could just she

1107.169 --> 1113.5800000000002
just got worse and worse she totally

1108.85 --> 1113.58
bitter doubt terribly terribly bitter

1115.019 --> 1121.8990000000001
like a grudge against the world type of

1119.289 --> 1126.549
thing that's what it ended with terrible

1121.899 --> 1134.379
but ya know anyway she's not around

1126.549 --> 1138.07
anymore for a while but it's all weird

1134.379 --> 1142.1789999999999
how that how that all turns it is also

1138.07 --> 1144.549
kind of a thing about the whole choosing

1142.179 --> 1148.1490000000001
in your early life to become a liberal

1144.549 --> 1150.1589999999999
to go with that and why you choose it

1148.149 --> 1155.7399999999998
you usually people choose it out of

1150.159 --> 1158.8300000000002
naivety or out of just they want certain

1155.74 --> 1164.32
things they dream of so much that they

1158.83 --> 1167.259
just want to rush it you know but and

1164.32 --> 1169.6899999999998
that can be that can lead to like a

1167.259 --> 1170.46
period where they are kind of crushing

1169.69 --> 1172.89
it and it is

1170.46 --> 1176.8400000000001
kinda glorious but it always tends to

1172.89 --> 1180.8000000000002
unravel I think or become super dark

1176.84 --> 1185.3999999999999
eventually I think that is what happens

1180.8 --> 1189.6599999999999
no mud it's not a silver medallion as in

1185.4 --> 1193.76
a prized medallion this is a pendant it

1189.66 --> 1198.51
is silver though it is pure silver like

1193.76 --> 1203.87
99.9% silver and I carved a flower of

1198.51 --> 1203.87
life into it

1206.57 --> 1209.57
yeah

1220.68 --> 1225.02
so anyway they have family issues

1240.93 --> 1249.75
you know it's also weird to reflect upon

1244.71 --> 1252.33
my own Road in between all that because

1249.75 --> 1255.36
I do realize I was in there and also

1252.33 --> 1255.9299999999998
where I just went nuts from things what

1255.36 --> 1259.4099999999999
happened

1255.93 --> 1261.9
and weird dark world visions all

1259.41 --> 1265.71
in-between that hair and they're not

1261.9 --> 1268.0500000000002
really sinking in at the time just

1265.71 --> 1273.2
thought up as a delusion and forgotten

1268.05 --> 1273.2
every time but

1275.63 --> 1282.71
it's so weird just I'm like as I say as

1280.039 --> 1285.679
I kind of admit like my working career

1282.71 --> 1291.13
is pretty much non-existent and I kind

1285.679 --> 1294.1100000000001
of like eluded all that all the time and

1291.13 --> 1296.179
when you talk about social welfare you

1294.11 --> 1299.24
think oh this guy must be on social

1296.179 --> 1301.669
welfare all his life well no that's only

1299.24 --> 1306.44
pretty much started five years ago

1301.669 --> 1312.5900000000001
before that I was never yeah it was

1306.44 --> 1315.2
always I was I didn't need it despite

1312.59 --> 1318.11
all the situations it's weird how my

1315.2 --> 1321.53
life worked out but there were also just

1318.11 --> 1323.7199999999998
I remember every time it's now only

1321.53 --> 1326.27
sinking in that there were just several

1323.72 --> 1329.289
moments throughout it all like three or

1326.27 --> 1333.53
four moments starting at my early teens

1329.289 --> 1337.73
where I was kind of just advised and

1333.53 --> 1340.789
even a bit with War II pushed by my

1337.73 --> 1342.919
parents like yeah you really have to go

1340.789 --> 1348.679
and get a job you really have to do this

1342.919 --> 1352.909
why why are you resisting this but when

1348.679 --> 1356.3300000000002
that happened I was just like in a panic

1352.909 --> 1361.73
situation I was all clammed down all

1356.33 --> 1366.86
bracing because I felt like this just is

1361.73 --> 1368.84
mad fear that I couldn't place like like

1366.86 --> 1370.6899999999998
really when you just want to escape on

1368.84 --> 1373.12
the spot

1370.69 --> 1375.67
[Music]

1373.12 --> 1381.1599999999999
and the weirdest thing was is that it

1375.67 --> 1384.49
terrified me that I even had that and as

1381.16 --> 1386.98
a result of it I really try to basically

1384.49 --> 1390.55
force everyone around me to stop

1386.98 --> 1394.42
reminding me about that it's I don't do

1390.55 --> 1398.47
that anymore now because now I just

1394.42 --> 1402.45
well that that weird bracing impulse is

1398.47 --> 1405.97
not that bad anymore but the backlash

1402.45 --> 1408.64
when kind of I try things and it doesn't

1405.97 --> 1414.429
work out right the backlash is pretty

1408.64 --> 1416.98
severe still but I need to work on that

1414.429 --> 1423.0400000000002
I need to work on basically forcing

1416.98 --> 1425.74
myself to not put so much hope and

1423.04 --> 1428.8
effort into it every time and just

1425.74 --> 1433.54
accept that it won't matter if I do that

1428.8 --> 1435.58
there's just gonna be minor chance every

1433.54 --> 1437.47
time I try something that I'll be

1435.58 --> 1439.36
accepted because of my background and

1437.47 --> 1443.559
there's absolutely nothing I can do

1439.36 --> 1447.01
about it unless I just keep it going and

1443.559 --> 1450.37
happened to bump into somebody they'll

1447.01 --> 1452.74
just recognize my spirit and see that I

1450.37 --> 1454.1499999999999
could do something or they were I was

1452.74 --> 1456.48
just the type of person they would

1454.15 --> 1461.73
happen to be looking for and they would

1456.48 --> 1461.73
just give me that direct opportunity

1462.69 --> 1466.77
that would definitely help

1468.6 --> 1471.77
[Music]

1476.389 --> 1482.9399999999998
right well Fyodor Dostoevsky

1479.249 --> 1488.669
I've never taken any any kind of

1482.94 --> 1490.799
pharmaceuticals against my my this my

1488.669 --> 1495.479
demons you could say the fear in this

1490.799 --> 1497.759
case never because my mother also didn't

1495.479 --> 1502.049
do that and my brother neither my

1497.759 --> 1504.6
brother also had some issues like but my

1502.049 --> 1507.33
mother and my brother alittle had asthma

1504.6 --> 1511.2289999999998
pretty bad and my mother would literally

1507.33 --> 1512.549
conquer it mentally that's all so

1511.229 --> 1514.739
additionally yes she learned the

1512.549 --> 1519.779
discipline to overcome that and that

1514.739 --> 1522.739
worked out pretty well so my mother

1519.779 --> 1528.109
pretty early on really tried to avoid

1522.739 --> 1530.7
she wasn't a naturalist and like try

1528.109 --> 1532.47
understood energetically about

1530.7 --> 1535.44
pharmaceuticals that you should stay

1532.47 --> 1537.749
away but after things broke as I said

1535.44 --> 1539.429
after she kind of fractured because she

1537.749 --> 1544.32
realized that she could not have her

1539.429 --> 1547.679
dream that that could never work out she

1544.32 --> 1549.84
kind of forgot about it all and that's

1547.679 --> 1552.1190000000001
when she started to take pharmaceuticals

1549.84 --> 1554.639
for all kinds of things antidepressants

1552.119 --> 1557.4599999999998
and allergy and it piled up and

1554.639 --> 1561.1999999999998
literally I think that is what killed

1557.46 --> 1564.2
her and she probably knew it

1561.2 --> 1564.2
subconsciously

1573.29 --> 1583.49
oh sure oh six well I'd like to say that

1580.73 --> 1586.19
I'm open to contact with Patricia I do

1583.49 --> 1591.32
still have her on skype I don't talk to

1586.19 --> 1593.96
her a lot really I don't know it's not

1591.32 --> 1595.9399999999998
like we have a personal friendship in

1593.96 --> 1597.559
the sense that we have constant

1595.94 --> 1600.0800000000002
conversations or anything I don't know

1597.559 --> 1603.799
that never really I don't know I think

1600.08 --> 1604.85
don't think Patricia felt I was suitable

1603.799 --> 1609.82
for that or something

1604.85 --> 1609.82
I hoped for it

1615.12 --> 1624.1689999999999
mark lost it after she left what what do

1621.21 --> 1624.169
you mean lost it

1637.31 --> 1643.95
well fine as long as you don't go into

1640.05 --> 1646.82
the whole trolling nonsense I'm fine

1643.95 --> 1646.82
talking about her

1667.55 --> 1670.6399999999999
right proficient fired my thoughts

1670.01 --> 1677.27
exactly

1670.64 --> 1681.1000000000001
mark is doing it awesome and I like a

1677.27 --> 1681.1
suit it fits him well

1688.21 --> 1697.57
or witness suit is jacket that that gray

1694.11 --> 1697.86
woolly thing whatever is it looks really

1697.57 --> 1700.9299999999998
cool

1697.86 --> 1700.9299999999998
[Music]

1703.94 --> 1710.96
ha right well if mud wants to come on my

1707.76 --> 1710.96
panel that's fine with me

1721.5 --> 1724.039
it

1725.11 --> 1729.3999999999999
[Music]

1740.48 --> 1747.99
well what you did want to talk about

1744.12 --> 1751.08
Patricia if you want to talk about her

1747.99 --> 1753.57
as a guest here on my show that's fine

1751.08 --> 1755.9099999999999
all you got to do is add me on skype and

1753.57 --> 1761.9099999999999
I'll call you in and we can talk about

1755.91 --> 1765.0900000000001
it if you want or anyone else wants to

1761.91 --> 1767.67
talk about anything or maybe put down a

1765.09 --> 1772.37
little presentation of some kind yeah

1767.67 --> 1777.42
you are welcome to do that here okay as

1772.37 --> 1782.84
you all know I I don't just burn every

1777.42 --> 1786.15
little detail anything that is said I

1782.84 --> 1790.59
just I kind of do let people do that

1786.15 --> 1792.93
thing even try to help them out by

1790.59 --> 1794.8799999999999
correcting them getting out

1792.93 --> 1799.0800000000002
misunderstandings in the way out of the

1794.88 --> 1801.72
way early but not necessarily just in

1799.08 --> 1804.84
order to break down their entire train

1801.72 --> 1809.54
of thought and then afterward then I

1804.84 --> 1812.31
will point out where they went wrong so

1809.54 --> 1815.49
anybody is welcome to join and you know

1812.31 --> 1819.33
you yeah you do get opportunity here to

1815.49 --> 1822.54
just speak although I'm not gonna let

1819.33 --> 1825.3899999999999
you do an hour-long presentation with

1822.54 --> 1828.2
Tier one arguments that's that's not

1825.39 --> 1828.2
gonna happen here

1833.22 --> 1836.22
yeah

1837.21 --> 1841.739
right proficient pirate I know this is a

1839.82 --> 1851.999
very inconvenient time for a lot of

1841.739 --> 1855.8990000000001
people and that is also why why I am

1851.999 --> 1860.179
pretty sure that I yeah there's not

1855.899 --> 1868.32
gonna be an early-bird number 400 and

1860.179 --> 1871.3490000000002
I'm gonna try to change it and in a way

1868.32 --> 1876.539
it's kind of tough because I'm just so

1871.349 --> 1881.07
used to doing this here but it comes

1876.539 --> 1883.469
with yeah and like a flexibility that I

1881.07 --> 1886.279
can't really afford anymore at this

1883.469 --> 1888.8690000000001
point but that doesn't mean that I can't

1886.279 --> 1893.879
that I'm just gonna quit you to worry

1888.869 --> 1895.9789999999998
and I'm not saying that oh yeah I'm

1893.879 --> 1902.879
gonna shut down in a week or anything no

1895.979 --> 1907.279
don't worry about that but I'm gonna try

1902.879 --> 1911.2489999999998
to move to another time slot for me and

1907.279 --> 1918.749
by doing so I also get more room in the

1911.249 --> 1923.869
day which I could potentially use yeah

1918.749 --> 1928.999
the kind of get myself out of financial

1923.869 --> 1928.999
[ __ ] where I am

1936.44 --> 1941.66
[Music]

1943.71 --> 1950.45
the more platforms you go on the more

1946.29 --> 1955.1
easier they can profile for you for

1950.45 --> 1955.1000000000001
profile you for their future what

1959.79 --> 1967.47
now what they do is metadata analyze you

1964.98 --> 1971.72
so they can whatever they're gonna

1967.47 --> 1977.07
produce is gonna be adapted to

1971.72 --> 1978.02
everything on average that's what it's

1977.07 --> 1982.23
really for

1978.02 --> 1986.34
it their metadata of you it functions

1982.23 --> 1988.38
effectively as as an inoculation

1986.34 --> 1991.9199999999998
for whatever they're going to produce

1988.38 --> 1995.67
because it will be calculated in your

1991.92 --> 1997.5600000000002
existence and how you function so

1995.67 --> 2002.45
whatever is going to be produced whether

1997.56 --> 2003.8
it be a narrative based mind control

2002.45 --> 2006.23
that's going to echo on through the

2003.8 --> 2008.69
people that yeah that are susceptible to

2006.23 --> 2011.57
that or whether it's just better

2008.69 --> 2014.99
directive itself it's going to be

2011.57 --> 2016.73
adapted to all the metadata it's going

2014.99 --> 2019.39
to be in calculated like what is the

2016.73 --> 2021.34
most effective result on average and

2019.39 --> 2024.73
taking everything into account

2021.34 --> 2032.03
especially people that typically have

2024.73 --> 2037.1
revolutionary influences that's what the

2032.03 --> 2039.58
metadata is really for besides just

2037.1 --> 2042.77
direct personal predictions and

2039.58 --> 2048.2599999999998
profiling and yeah for information that

2042.77 --> 2050.96
amazing if you want to look somebody up

2048.26 --> 2057.4900000000002
or and whatever that that is there of

2050.96 --> 2057.4900000000002
course also but what they use that with

2060.61 --> 2064.17
that's what I just described

2068.0 --> 2076.129
any big influences they fabricate

2073.419 --> 2078.3489999999997
influencers usually media media

2076.129 --> 2080.8689999999997
narrative points will be very much

2078.349 --> 2086.06
acceptable to metadata will be

2080.869 --> 2088.909
calculated in based on how it would be

2086.06 --> 2091.82
calculated to affect every one of which

2088.909 --> 2094.07
there is metadata on average kind of

2091.82 --> 2101.2400000000002
like that see it like that so they

2094.07 --> 2104.1800000000003
literally just predict through the

2101.24 --> 2105.83
inside of all the individuals what

2104.18 --> 2110.21
they're like and then predicting how

2105.83 --> 2112.0699999999997
they will respond individually for which

2110.21 --> 2116.39
they will probably have very efficient

2112.07 --> 2119.57
algorithms to simplify all that and then

2116.39 --> 2122.06
just calculate a wide spread like what

2119.57 --> 2124.19
will happen with all these people when

2122.06 --> 2127.81
they are in some ways subjected to this

2124.19 --> 2130.67
and then see what how that will change

2127.81 --> 2133.099
how it will be predicted to change

2130.67 --> 2137.15
things and that is kind of like the

2133.099 --> 2144.2000000000003
super-heavy calculation [ __ ] that is now

2137.15 --> 2147.29
like what they call the AI the AI advice

2144.2 --> 2151.6899999999996
as it were that's what I think how it

2147.29 --> 2156.58
works that's when you utilize the AI

2151.69 --> 2161.54
it's just a vast calculation adapted to

2156.58 --> 2164.96
how things would respond like a giant

2161.54 --> 2168.7
world size petri dish in which they can

2164.96 --> 2174.05
speed up things and just quickly predict

2168.7 --> 2176.1189999999997
anyway that's what I think maybe it's

2174.05 --> 2179.3900000000003
not that yet maybe it will turn out to

2176.119 --> 2182.06
become that maybe now they use a little

2179.39 --> 2184.52
bit more oversimplified systems that

2182.06 --> 2188.839
kind of hint at that but aren't

2184.52 --> 2191.68
literally like that yet or maybe it's

2188.839 --> 2191.68
not viable because

2193.79 --> 2198.2
because of unforeseen reasons I don't

2196.32 --> 2204.1400000000003
know

2198.2 --> 2204.14
no mod I'm not going to do that

2213.02 --> 2216.34
hey peanuts clerk

2221.34 --> 2225.9
hmm

2223.24 --> 2225.8999999999996
yeah

2232.21 --> 2236.65
yeah good to see you back look ya

2234.28 --> 2238.5400000000004
peanuts Clark you still have a ranch you

2236.65 --> 2246.4300000000003
I hope you noticed you're now banned

2238.54 --> 2249.97
from my chat I just said that like it's

2246.43 --> 2259.5589999999997
probably better I don't have you on as a

2249.97 --> 2262.8089999999997
panel as I guess because it's just um

2259.559 --> 2267.0690000000004
maybe I will reconsider that by the way

2262.809 --> 2271.48
but I I certainly need to be a little

2267.069 --> 2274.68
bit more careful when I have you on as a

2271.48 --> 2278.2
guest and make sure that I'm not

2274.68 --> 2282.16
preoccupied with my own issues because

2278.2 --> 2284.5789999999997
yeah last time that went very wrong as

2282.16 --> 2284.5789999999997
you well remember

2296.58 --> 2299.15
yeah

2331.97 --> 2339.12
ask and receive no firewall for you dude

2336.48 --> 2343.8
you apparently don't understand how it

2339.12 --> 2347.46
really works the no firewall for humans

2343.8 --> 2349.17
is not because an AI is hacking you and

2347.46 --> 2354.09
your computer to extract your

2349.17 --> 2355.92
information what it's doing is taking

2354.09 --> 2359.2200000000003
all the information you've been

2355.92 --> 2362.13
voluntarily giving over the times on the

2359.22 --> 2365.49
Internet and then using that to just

2362.13 --> 2368.1600000000003
simply figure you out much better than

2365.49 --> 2371.6899999999996
you can figure yourself out and then be

2368.16 --> 2375.75
able to predict what you will do and

2371.69 --> 2378.81
what you will like that's what the AI

2375.75 --> 2383.13
does it just uses the information that

2378.81 --> 2385.86
you've given out freely for whatever

2383.13 --> 2388.4900000000002
reason usually just not even realize

2385.86 --> 2388.4900000000002
you're doing that

2398.08 --> 2403.7
well peanuts Clark look I didn't

2401.599 --> 2407.9300000000003
embarrass you in front of 50 people I

2403.7 --> 2410.27
mostly embarrassed myself probably with

2407.93 --> 2412.79
doing that I thought it was very

2410.27 --> 2420.67
embarrassing afterward okay

2412.79 --> 2426.68
and as for you it was a little

2420.67 --> 2431.21
embarrassing the sloppiness I explained

2426.68 --> 2435.0989999999997
that afterward but I look I don't think

2431.21 --> 2442.67
you were embarrassed by me really

2435.099 --> 2445.4900000000002
because I was technically right you were

2442.67 --> 2449.33
not too informed about how I felt about

2445.49 --> 2451.49
the situation and I kind of demanded

2449.33 --> 2454.97
that but technically that's not a

2451.49 --> 2457.27
reasonable demand but I was just too

2454.97 --> 2461.27
preoccupied with it at the time and

2457.27 --> 2464.24
that's an issue so because of that I

2461.27 --> 2472.15
technically just embarrassed myself with

2464.24 --> 2472.1499999999996
my behavior you felt embarrassed okay

2473.6 --> 2478.36
right well I'm sorry about that

2481.76 --> 2488.65
although I would like to ask you to just

2485.47 --> 2488.6499999999996
[Music]

2497.74 --> 2507.5499999999997
just when I have issues with certain

2500.32 --> 2512.4100000000003
people just try to be careful done

2507.55 --> 2515.73
don't tell me to apologize to anyone you

2512.41 --> 2520.0
know nobody needs to tell me that that

2515.73 --> 2523.839
is humiliating to me because if an

2520.0 --> 2528.82
apology should be made then I will do it

2523.839 --> 2533.14
nobody needs to tell me that I always do

2528.82 --> 2537.88
that if it is correct and I will do it

2533.14 --> 2540.06
as correctly as possible and I don't

2537.88 --> 2544.48
think that is humiliating

2540.06 --> 2546.7599999999998
when I do that I think it's an honor but

2544.48 --> 2547.27
when somebody tells me that I should do

2546.76 --> 2556.15
that

2547.27 --> 2559.81
that feels dishonorable to me unless it

2556.15 --> 2562.119
is very obvious that for somehow for

2559.81 --> 2565.2999999999997
some reason whatever I did wrong

2562.119 --> 2568.69
completely eludes me obviously because I

2565.3 --> 2575.369
don't show any signs of realizing that

2568.69 --> 2578.589
anything has happened like that but ya

2575.369 --> 2583.7200000000003
know this is all just me in my social

2578.589 --> 2586.089
affairs and I don't regard how I

2583.72 --> 2590.98
function like that to be something that

2586.089 --> 2594.31
I'm should demand from people that they

2590.98 --> 2597.67
adapt to that although it would be much

2594.31 --> 2600.2799999999997
more convenient if they did but I don't

2597.67 --> 2604.51
think I can expect that it's my issues

2600.28 --> 2609.82
it's my weird behavior concerning social

2604.51 --> 2613.65
relations and in the end I'm the one

2609.82 --> 2616.4500000000003
that needs to fix that to somehow stop

2613.65 --> 2618.7200000000003
putting that [ __ ] on other people and

2616.45 --> 2623.8799999999997
just be able to deal with it internally

2618.72 --> 2623.8799999999997
because it is just embarrassing it is

[Music]

2634.88 --> 2638.619
[Music]

2641.7 --> 2652.23
yeah and I realized that peanuts Clark I

2644.7 --> 2654.99
know and I eat that I even felt that as

2652.23 --> 2658.4
I said it just completely hit the wrong

2654.99 --> 2658.3999999999996
snare despite it all

[Music]

2681.55 --> 2687.8500000000004
Oh oh really

2684.79 --> 2688.36
Oh Oh Trish Blythe do you mean rhasta

2687.85 --> 2691.56
hat

2688.36 --> 2695.8
you mean rhasta hat don't you oh you

2691.56 --> 2709.93
couldn't you could not leave it alone

2695.8 --> 2713.2000000000003
right I'm a jet you think that's right

2709.93 --> 2717.48
you think that she's right because she's

2713.2 --> 2717.48
not talking in general really

2734.94 --> 2738.289
what are you talking about

2740.67 --> 2750.839
he lost me my only super chat and the

2745.829 --> 2753.38
p900 what are you talking about that's

2750.839 --> 2753.38
[ __ ]

2766.17 --> 2769.3
[Music]

2790.08 --> 2799.47
no trace light actually that was his

2796.02 --> 2800.36
opinion that was what he thought was

2799.47 --> 2804.1499999999996
going on

2800.36 --> 2806.94
that's not deceiving me you know I can

2804.15 --> 2812.33
make up my own mind when Rasta says

2806.94 --> 2815.2200000000003
something I listen to what he says

2812.33 --> 2820.89
potentially reflect upon it and then I

2815.22 --> 2825.81
make up my own mind because yeah we've

2820.89 --> 2830.91
had we've had a lot of talks and you

2825.81 --> 2834.39
know I'm not an idiot Rasta has is very

2830.91 --> 2840.6
much out there and it's not my personal

2834.39 --> 2845.99
tactic right but he does have very keen

2840.6 --> 2849.45
eye on things in general just not so

2845.99 --> 2851.6699999999996
tactical in his approach or well did

2849.45 --> 2855.08
it's all depends on how you see it to

2851.67 --> 2855.08
him it is very tactical

2861.71 --> 2867.2
[Music]

2864.51 --> 2867.2000000000003
all right

2870.439 --> 2881.609
hmm I kind of agree with you there's

2877.38 --> 2885.63
your checker but I don't know what Trish

2881.609 --> 2889.549
likes issue is constantly you know on

2885.63 --> 2892.049
other in other places I see you're just

2889.549 --> 2894.089
supporting me or giving me these

2892.049 --> 2896.729
comments like Oh aren't you happy now

2894.089 --> 2898.679
are we aren't you happy now oh so glad

2896.729 --> 2902.489
we all prayed for you or something like

2898.679 --> 2911.759
that but then you come in the chat and

2902.489 --> 2914.099
you drop something like this on me it's

2911.759 --> 2916.979
okay you can work on that you will need

2914.099 --> 2922.199
to lose a few friends though that don't

2916.979 --> 2929.249
have your best interests at heart who

2922.199 --> 2931.529
says something like that okay you know

2929.249 --> 2933.709
how creepy that is if you put that all

2931.529 --> 2933.709
together

2944.88 --> 2950.7200000000003
all right I agree peanuts Clark

2952.609 --> 2962.97
he is unrelentingly outspoken I I like

2958.619 --> 2966.46
to call it and that's yeah that usually

2962.97 --> 2972.0699999999997
comes with some level of pain to someone

2966.46 --> 2972.07
[Laughter]

2982.13 --> 2987.48
[Music]

2984.26 --> 2990.0600000000004
right well Trish Blythe I I do

2987.48 --> 2993.87
appreciate your hundred percent support

2990.06 --> 2997.47
but could you please from that hundred

2993.87 --> 3000.47
percent support exclude things like

2997.47 --> 3003.02
comments telling me that I should

3000.47 --> 3004.58
probably drop a couple of friends that

3003.02 --> 3009.58
don't have my best interest at heart

3004.58 --> 3017.33
because I don't need any advice in that

3009.58 --> 3019.5499999999997
sense you know I have my own senses

3017.33 --> 3022.36
they're they're they're kind of I'm

3019.55 --> 3026.42
sensitive I'm kind of sharp at this I I

3022.36 --> 3029.4500000000003
give regular lectures on details of my

3026.42 --> 3032.03
senses and how I see people and what I

3029.45 --> 3035.27
recognize and glories and hopes and all

3032.03 --> 3042.61
that so I really don't need any advice

3035.27 --> 3046.34
on that but you could always point at

3042.61 --> 3049.52
certain flaws you think somebody may

3046.34 --> 3052.94
have that you think may be worrisome for

3049.52 --> 3054.98
some reason and then hey if you got it

3052.94 --> 3058.91
right somehow I'll actually respond to

3054.98 --> 3063.04
that and I'll tell you what my thoughts

3058.91 --> 3063.04
on it have been over time

3072.42 --> 3076.9
and if you've paid a bit of attention

3075.46 --> 3081.13
you notice that's what generally happens

3076.9 --> 3086.77
here people say something they say oh

3081.13 --> 3091.54
this guy or this girl did this and then

3086.77 --> 3095.41
if it's something that I can have a

3091.54 --> 3097.42
response to to some level sensibility

3095.41 --> 3099.72
I'll do it and that's part of what this

3097.42 --> 3099.7200000000003
show is

3107.299 --> 3114.69
right peanuts Clark or as Owen Benjamin

3110.849 --> 3119.46
says it paths what's not for me really

3114.69 --> 3123.42
but or Benjamin no it no it's actually

3119.46 --> 3125.549
Nathan Nathan says that you swallow the

3123.42 --> 3129.0
meat and spit out the bones kind of

3125.549 --> 3132.809
thing right maybe Owen says that - I

3129.0 --> 3135.71
don't know I don't think so although he

3132.809 --> 3135.71
could typically

3142.92 --> 3147.66
yes sir Chico asks an interesting

3146.069 --> 3150.119
question where do you think asteroids

3147.66 --> 3153.5099999999998
meteorites that impact the earth come

3150.119 --> 3156.779
from well I'm not sure that they really

3153.51 --> 3161.01
impact because I don't think there's

3156.779 --> 3164.13
really big impact holes from meteorites

3161.01 --> 3168.0190000000002
not really but there may be rocks

3164.13 --> 3172.4700000000003
falling down okay a week ago or so

3168.019 --> 3177.24
something like that I myself saw any

3172.47 --> 3181.019
falling star again pretty much in front

3177.24 --> 3183.6899999999996
of my nose but and it was pretty close

3181.019 --> 3189.72
you could see the glitter almost coming

3183.69 --> 3191.94
off it and yeah that does happen

3189.72 --> 3194.7599999999998
apparently I don't know where it comes

3191.94 --> 3199.589
from exactly this you could speculate

3194.76 --> 3202.289
all over the place you really can like

3199.589 --> 3205.019
does it is it a chip of the dome or the

3202.289 --> 3210.329
ceiling or the chip off the bottom of

3205.019 --> 3211.3089999999997
the world falling through it all what is

3210.329 --> 3218.9900000000002
that

3211.309 --> 3222.4500000000003
are they lump stuff I don't know weird

3218.99 --> 3227.5789999999997
Riya yeah plasma reactions that then

3222.45 --> 3229.6189999999997
somehow form rocks are I gave this is

3227.579 --> 3231.63
just nonsense but I don't know what they

3229.619 --> 3236.279
are I don't know where they are exactly

3231.63 --> 3239.099
coming from I've speculated that at

3236.279 --> 3242.609
least some of them could be man-made

3239.099 --> 3246.569
like catapulted things I don't know it

3242.609 --> 3248.279
seems really weird especially with so

3246.569 --> 3250.17
many of them site that doesn't make a

3248.279 --> 3253.14
lot of sense there would be so much

3250.17 --> 3255.9900000000002
evidence of it happening although they

3253.14 --> 3262.44
may be able to do it on location for

3255.99 --> 3265.0389999999998
reasons but yeah the regular ones I

3262.44 --> 3265.039
don't know

3265.19 --> 3273.559
I don't know if if there yeah if like

3271.13 --> 3278.059
there seems to be even differences

3273.559 --> 3281.0890000000004
between like high up falling stars that

3278.059 --> 3288.38
are just striped jerseys especially in

3281.089 --> 3292.5389999999998
August and clear skies but yeah there

3288.38 --> 3296.089
also seems to be more localized

3292.539 --> 3299.0
meteorites or glitters that just that

3296.089 --> 3300.589
have proximity that have literal sound

3299.0 --> 3303.319
coming off that all that and I don't

3300.589 --> 3311.02
know where that comes from I have no

3303.319 --> 3311.02
idea it's quite mysterious to me

3320.48 --> 3328.27
it

3323.02 --> 3330.84
debris Wow space debris what kind of

3328.27 --> 3330.84
space debris

3341.77 --> 3346.87
yeah Resta I'm kind of staying out of it

3344.69 --> 3346.87
but

3359.269 --> 3367.3999999999996
there need not be any screenshots

3363.289 --> 3367.4
because it's right there

3377.43 --> 3382.39

3380.359 --> 3382.39

Trish Blythe you think that sounds like

3429.21 --> 3436.17
a 12 year old girl my god but if I had a

3434.099 --> 3438.8900000000003
daughter that would sound like that she

3436.17 --> 3438.89
would be in big trouble

3444.92 --> 3449.329
but I don't know maybe you're used to it

3454.45 --> 3467.8289999999997
oh dear hmm well if you guys want you

3465.28 --> 3472.65
can come on my early bird show tomorrow

3467.829 --> 3472.65
and do a second round

3477.33 --> 3485.15

3481.29 --> 3485.15
there were a lot of issues with that

3500.8 --> 3503.8
yeah

3506.48 --> 3513.44
is that a decline there I here with

3509.27 --> 3515.47

all the snickering Smiley's it seems

3535.96 --> 3542.13

3539.53 --> 3542.13
decline

3555.07 --> 3561.59
okay

3557.78 --> 3565.67
