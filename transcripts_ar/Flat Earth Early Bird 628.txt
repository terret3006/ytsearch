difficulties as

youtube has just just like that

174.16 --> 178.239
uh basically scrapped my original

177.2 --> 181.599
interface

178.239 --> 183.59900000000002
for setting up the shows and yeah for

181.599 --> 188.0
some reason that included

183.599 --> 189.92
the original signal output of obs

188.0 --> 198.8
like the stream key and all that so it's

189.92 --> 202.319
it's kind of a bit of a mess

198.8 --> 204.72
let me see it's not a live where

i don't get it it's not showing live on

222.159 --> 227.84

289.199 --> 292.72
it's youtube studio

294.4 --> 299.919

341.919 --> 347.84
channel

343.6 --> 347.84000000000003

turn something off

352.639 --> 367.84000000000003
hold on

368.96 --> 372.71999999999997

371.36 --> 376.40000000000003
it's still about to come

372.72 --> 376.40000000000003
but that the other stream that's not

378.84 --> 384.4
working

380.24 --> 395.84000000000003
hmm maybe i should go there and end it

384.4 --> 395.84
maybe then it'll show up

399.12 --> 409.84000000000003
if that's even possible

410.08 --> 423.84
oh my god

i i can't find it

434.319 --> 439.12
i i don't know how to delete a stream

439.199 --> 442.72
seriously youtube what the [ __ ] is up

442.16 --> 446.88000000000005
with your

442.72 --> 450.08000000000004
stupid interface oh damn it i found it

446.88 --> 454.88
oh that was well hidden

450.08 --> 454.88
sheesh yeah okay

458.96 --> 466.08
okay that's gone

462.479 --> 467.28
let's see my main page and i don't see

466.08 --> 469.599
it

467.28 --> 472.08
i don't see my own live stream you can't

469.599 --> 474.319
find my own live stream on my own page

472.08 --> 479.84
anymore this is just great youtube

474.319 --> 479.84000000000003
brilliant you're so effective

484.8 --> 489.039
oh wait if you go to videos there you

488.08 --> 493.44
see it oh and i

489.039 --> 496.08
what this is called 268. lulls

493.44 --> 496.08
that's odd

496.8 --> 500.879
yeah let's let's change that

504.84 --> 507.84
268.

518.839 --> 521.839
628

526.0 --> 529.04
you can see it yet

531.36 --> 539.839
yes okay i think i got it in order but

535.04 --> 544.88
yeah youtube what the [ __ ] are you doing

539.839 --> 548.48
didn't ask for it either uh

544.88 --> 552.08
right so let's continue the show

548.48 --> 554.88
oh i'm cooking here

552.08 --> 558.399
even though there's a little bit of a

554.88 --> 558.399
shade sometimes out there

558.72 --> 565.6
but it's it's still very moist

563.44 --> 565.6
so

572.959 --> 577.8389999999999
let's see

580.98 --> 584.1
[Music]

586.24 --> 591.519
it's just very warm although yeah right

588.56 --> 593.8389999999999
now it's a little bit nicer outside

591.519 --> 596.5600000000001
but yeah the inside has just absorbed

593.839 --> 599.12
all that heat

596.56 --> 599.68
so in here it's really hot i got my fan

599.12 --> 602.8
though

599.68 --> 604.4799999999999
i don't know i guess i i could keep it

602.8 --> 606.24
because i've been using that thing for

604.48 --> 619.53
almost a week now

606.24 --> 621.839
very happy to have it

619.53 --> 624.72
[Music]

621.839 --> 627.0400000000001
right so i still have the apple i

624.72 --> 627.0400000000001
haven't

627.6 --> 632.48
i haven't eaten it yet it's still good i

630.32 --> 636.399
have a

632.48 --> 636.399
fresh melon it was in the discount

639.279 --> 643.92
and i'm probably gonna cut that open

641.839 --> 648.0790000000001
somewhere

643.92 --> 651.8389999999999
during the show i really i i almost

648.079 --> 654.0
feel like taking apart right now

651.839 --> 655.0400000000001
anyway i still also have grapefruit

654.0 --> 657.279
juice

655.04 --> 658.24
i ran out of the other juice and i

657.279 --> 661.8389999999999
thought now i

658.24 --> 661.839
had enough of that

668.0 --> 675.76
also i got sandals

672.16 --> 680.16
kind of as i said i would

675.76 --> 683.279
kind of basic ones see

680.16 --> 685.279
but yeah i'm very glad they did they

683.279 --> 687.4399999999999
happened to be in the discount so

685.279 --> 688.88
they were not that expensive like 30

687.44 --> 691.6800000000001
euros it's

688.88 --> 692.32
they're cheap but yeah i'm not gonna

691.68 --> 696.0
wear them

692.32 --> 698.72
per like all the time so it's really for

696.0 --> 703.839
when it's this kind of insane heat it's

698.72 --> 703.839
good to have those

714.839 --> 718.639
john

716.639 --> 720.72
but yeah it's it's hot over here it's

718.639 --> 723.6800000000001
almost ridiculously hot

720.72 --> 726.639
in the sense that it's it's really too

723.68 --> 730.079
hot to do a proper show for me like this

726.639 --> 731.76
but i still manage somehow i

730.079 --> 734.079
still managed to get some technical

731.76 --> 736.639
stuff out

734.079 --> 739.12
overall it's way too hot like this it's

736.639 --> 741.76
crazy and i've seen

739.12 --> 741.76
like uh

743.519 --> 750.639
oh and benjamin last time was also

748.32 --> 753.44
like it looked extremely hot over there

750.639 --> 753.44
as well so

754.0 --> 759.2
ah oh i got a foot bath it's very

770.839 --> 774.32
ah

772.0 --> 775.6
i hear a baby crying it's not a baby

774.32 --> 779.36
it's just a

775.6 --> 782.48
whining kid well baby

779.36 --> 784.8000000000001
it's a cry baby but he's constantly

782.48 --> 788.32
doing that

784.8 --> 789.5999999999999
is chat frozen that's a good one because

788.32 --> 792.399
i think the chat is

789.6 --> 794.72
thank you for noticing the chat is still

792.399 --> 797.44
of the other one

794.72 --> 801.839
that's right forgot thank you for

797.44 --> 801.839
reminding me

803.68 --> 806.399
there we go

813.12 --> 819.92
it's nathan thompson oh my god

816.24 --> 821.04
tiny wumble terrible anyway let's go

819.92 --> 823.8389999999999
through chat

821.04 --> 826.48
i hope uh i did put the link out of this

823.839 --> 830.0
chat into the other

826.48 --> 833.279
so in this one obamacare was first

830.0 --> 837.68
because yeah he found it

833.279 --> 842.32
ben young fuzzler good servant

837.68 --> 845.199
tom parker seeking star wars

842.32 --> 845.1990000000001
michael o'rourke

845.92 --> 848.8
eyes white shot

850.8 --> 853.199
dank

854.0 --> 860.399
here we go again

857.519 --> 860.399
john bernards

865.68 --> 874.6389999999999
julie of heaven eternal

871.04 --> 877.68
yeah i think i got everyone tiny wumbo

874.639 --> 880.0
yeah good to see you all

877.68 --> 881.199
i'm gonna do another double shift so in

880.0 --> 883.279
this case

881.199 --> 884.88
it's going to be a one and a half hour

883.279 --> 887.8389999999999
show or something

884.88 --> 888.56
because i started really late and then

887.839 --> 890.5600000000001
after i

888.56 --> 894.079
started really late i had technical

890.56 --> 894.079
problems making it even later

896.839 --> 899.839
right

901.6 --> 908.48
but yeah around this time it should get

905.04 --> 911.36
a lot better temperature wise

908.48 --> 912.16
because like after the half hour mark

911.36 --> 916.24
it's pretty much

912.16 --> 919.04
when the sun stops hitting the wall

916.24 --> 920.5600000000001
and then it yeah becomes a bit more

919.04 --> 927.8389999999999
viable here

920.56 --> 927.8389999999999
play the missing

929.04 --> 937.04
right yeah i'm completely

933.199 --> 942.16
did not make any notes again

937.04 --> 945.92
no there wasn't too much going on

942.16 --> 949.279
yes well like on the usual

945.92 --> 952.16
channels like there was no

949.279 --> 953.04
uh oh and benjamin he might have been on

952.16 --> 956.639
really late

953.04 --> 960.88
but i missed that so i don't know

956.639 --> 960.88
uh yeah no flat of debate of course

963.839 --> 970.639
i did hang around a bit at the uh

967.199 --> 972.24
24 7 discord and just kind of switching

970.639 --> 975.519
around

972.24 --> 976.399
and this morning i yeah the ugly jew was

975.519 --> 979.199
streaming

976.399 --> 980.24
somebody else's i don't think he was on

979.199 --> 981.7589999999999
anymore

980.24 --> 983.839
and so i checked out that channel and

981.759 --> 987.36
there was kind of like a

983.839 --> 988.32
goofy american guy it's about the masks

987.36 --> 990.0
mostly and

988.32 --> 991.759
yeah it was kind of funny hanging around

990.0 --> 994.959
there and uh

991.759 --> 997.839
nothing too noteworthy

994.959 --> 997.8389999999999
uh

999.12 --> 1005.68
don't think i watched any movies

1002.48 --> 1009.1990000000001
i oh god yeah i tried one but

1005.68 --> 1010.16
then i yeah i i had to sample it again

1009.199 --> 1013.12
to remember

1010.16 --> 1014.7199999999999
like why i i despised that movie so much

1013.12 --> 1018.5600000000001
beverly hills nina

1014.72 --> 1021.12
god it's the worst

1018.56 --> 1023.3599999999999
and i just thought like is it really as

1021.12 --> 1026.0
bad as i remember that

1023.36 --> 1027.439
then i just checked it out and it's like

1026.0 --> 1030.799
oh no no no wait

1027.439 --> 1033.679
it it kind of starts out like yeah

1030.799 --> 1034.6399999999999
you know i get it i get the story i get

1033.679 --> 1037.1200000000001
the

1034.64 --> 1038.5590000000002
the context but then the freaking guy

1037.12 --> 1042.1599999999999
starts to speak

1038.559 --> 1045.039
in his supposed ninja way and oh my god

1042.16 --> 1048.799
it's so aggravating like every and just

1045.039 --> 1051.12
he messes up [ __ ] expect that but it's

1048.799 --> 1053.76
it's too much he's just too [ __ ]

1051.12 --> 1056.32
annoying

1053.76 --> 1057.52
and they're all so unbelievably patient

1056.32 --> 1060.6399999999999
with him

1057.52 --> 1062.96
it's not funny anymore it's just ah so i

1060.64 --> 1067.6000000000001
didn't i stopped watching that

1062.96 --> 1070.48
ugh it's the worst

1067.6 --> 1072.6399999999999
that's as far as i got with movies and

1070.48 --> 1075.679
[ __ ]

1072.64 --> 1078.5590000000002
i didn't watch any of the mandalorian

1075.679 --> 1078.5590000000002
forgot about that

1078.96 --> 1082.64
i think i was gaming a lot oh yeah yeah

1081.28 --> 1087.28
and

1082.64 --> 1092.7990000000002
yeah watching more yeah alex jones yep

1087.28 --> 1092.799
uh what was it about yeah they're mostly

1092.84 --> 1095.84
just

1097.84 --> 1102.24
yeah they're just doing the same thing

1099.52 --> 1102.24
they have been doing

1106.84 --> 1110.0
uh

1108.0 --> 1111.09
don't know i i technically forgot the

1110.0 --> 1115.52
content it's just

1111.09 --> 1118.32
[Music]

1115.52 --> 1118.96
a lot of mask situation they they put

1118.32 --> 1122.24
out some good

1118.96 --> 1125.52
videos that are like

1122.24 --> 1125.52
still pretty effective

1125.76 --> 1130.96
you know like their creative department

1128.96 --> 1131.6000000000001
is really creative they do get very

1130.96 --> 1136.0
inspired

1131.6 --> 1137.9189999999999
and they they do know how to build

1136.0 --> 1140.16
gripping videos that yeah they've done

1137.919 --> 1142.24
that of course over 20 years

1140.16 --> 1143.28
but they're like it's just the skills

1142.24 --> 1146.24
grown and

1143.28 --> 1148.0
there's some really talented editors and

1146.24 --> 1151.84
video makers there

1148.0 --> 1151.84
that are very compelling

1152.799 --> 1161.28
so yeah i still get caught watching that

1158.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
uh poppy's

1161.28 --> 1165.84
metal um

1170.08 --> 1172.48
all right

1177.52 --> 1182.8799999999999
oh yeah and having more long

1180.799 --> 1184.55
conversations with

1182.88 --> 1188.24
my roommate

1184.55 --> 1188.24
[Music]

1188.4 --> 1192.96
i think i'm slightly attracted to her

1191.36 --> 1194.3999999999999
that's weird

1192.96 --> 1196.4
but i don't think it's gonna work out

1194.4 --> 1198.16
but there's just this chemistry from my

1196.4 --> 1201.919
side and

1198.16 --> 1205.039
i like i like talking with her

1201.919 --> 1207.2
and like i

1205.039 --> 1209.2
have this tendency like oh i want to

1207.2 --> 1210.48
treat you as if you were my girlfriend

1209.2 --> 1214.4
but

1210.48 --> 1214.4
i shouldn't do that because that's

1218.84 --> 1223.12
inappropriate

1220.0 --> 1223.919
i don't think she's like into me she is

1223.12 --> 1227.9189999999999
interested

1223.919 --> 1227.919
she's just not connecting

1232.0 --> 1235.84
like with her heart anyway with their

1233.52 --> 1235.84
mind yeah

1240.0 --> 1245.84
what avoided at all cost

1246.559 --> 1249.84
is she cute yeah well she is kind of

1249.039 --> 1252.64
cute

1249.84 --> 1254.48
but she is a self-professed lesbian

1252.64 --> 1258.3200000000002
though

1254.48 --> 1261.6
and she is she kind of lives

1258.32 --> 1264.6399999999999
like a typical dude would

1261.6 --> 1267.76
bit messy uh and

1264.64 --> 1269.8400000000001
just yeah it's not as terrible as some

1267.76 --> 1271.76
guys have it thank god

1269.84 --> 1273.52
but she is slightly disorganized and

1271.76 --> 1276.559
[ __ ] and i don't know

1273.52 --> 1279.039
she just likes to think of herself as

1276.559 --> 1279.76
yeah being a guy or something not that

1279.039 --> 1282.8799999999999
she like

1279.76 --> 1285.28
really gets so dressy up or whatever no

1282.88 --> 1289.1200000000001
she does still look like a girl

1285.28 --> 1290.8799999999999
she's just her inner attitude anyway

1289.12 --> 1292.3999999999999
yeah i know that would make things

1290.88 --> 1292.7990000000002
difficult well i've had that before

1292.4 --> 1294.159
because

1292.799 --> 1296.08
like three quarters of all my

1294.159 --> 1297.7600000000002
ex-girlfriends were all self-professed

1296.08 --> 1302.24
lesbians so

1297.76 --> 1305.84
i i sense a pattern

1302.24 --> 1305.84
it's like i don't know

1306.08 --> 1309.76
sometimes i feel like i'm there just to

1308.48 --> 1312.72
remind them

1309.76 --> 1313.919
that it's not really real something like

1312.72 --> 1318.88
that like yeah

1313.919 --> 1322.4
you just haven't met somebody right

1318.88 --> 1332.48
and yeah it works many times

1322.4 --> 1335.2
my first girlfriend was a lesbian yeah

1332.48 --> 1335.2
and my last

1336.799 --> 1341.039
and yeah in between i'm not too sure

1339.2 --> 1344.48
what they're doing you know

1341.039 --> 1346.559
they were yeah young and

1344.48 --> 1348.48
kind of lost and they they could go all

1346.559 --> 1349.28
directions so who knows some of them may

1348.48 --> 1353.1200000000001
end up like

1349.28 --> 1356.559
terrible sjws or something

1353.12 --> 1356.559
oh god i saw some

1356.72 --> 1364.559
antifa people today

1360.4 --> 1367.44
ugh and that was not good for me

1364.559 --> 1370.08
in the sense that it's like what how

1367.44 --> 1371.8400000000001
dare you wear freaking antifa shirts in

1370.08 --> 1374.32
my city

1371.84 --> 1376.799
and i was like oh if they're organizing

1374.32 --> 1379.28
something i'm gonna follow them

1376.799 --> 1380.96
but now he was just i didn't know what

1379.28 --> 1383.84
he was doing

1380.96 --> 1383.8400000000001
it wasn't a horde

1385.52 --> 1393.28
but yeah there's some other people too

1389.679 --> 1394.799
and we're getting a bit nervous over

1393.28 --> 1398.24
here in utrecht maybe

1394.799 --> 1399.6
maybe some of us that like all the

1398.24 --> 1401.44
lockdown [ __ ]

1399.6 --> 1402.7199999999998
everywhere and we're like this is not

1401.44 --> 1405.919
gonna freaking happen

1402.72 --> 1408.72
to our city and i am yeah i

1405.919 --> 1411.76
echo that sentiment a lot like you're

1408.72 --> 1416.96
not gonna [ __ ] do that here

1411.76 --> 1420.64
like really not or it's gonna be riots

1416.96 --> 1420.64
and i'll be in those [ __ ] riots

1421.279 --> 1428.24
and not to steal [ __ ] no no no targeted

1425.039 --> 1431.84
direct direct attacks

1428.24 --> 1435.1200000000001
on those responsible which we

1431.84 --> 1436.24
know we know it it's very easy to figure

1435.12 --> 1438.559
out now

1436.24 --> 1438.559
you know

1440.159 --> 1444.7990000000002
anyway yeah because but for now it's

1443.2 --> 1445.52
okay you know but it could just they

1444.799 --> 1448.1589999999999
could just

1445.52 --> 1450.1589999999999
pull that like have some [ __ ] liberal

1448.159 --> 1452.5590000000002
piece of [ __ ] politicians

1450.159 --> 1454.3200000000002
in there sneak in there do that and oh

1452.559 --> 1456.24
suddenly it's passed and then they

1454.32 --> 1458.24
quickly go on their plane to somewhere

1456.24 --> 1460.159
else or something you know

1458.24 --> 1461.679
i fully expect that sort of [ __ ] to

1460.159 --> 1467.6000000000001
happen

1461.679 --> 1470.3200000000002
but yeah it's we're not gonna allow that

1467.6 --> 1472.0
we're just not taking that [ __ ] we're

1470.32 --> 1474.24
already done with the masks pretty

1472.0 --> 1475.44
much there's still people wearing masks

1474.24 --> 1478.4
but they

1475.44 --> 1480.799
don't bother anyone and they'd have a

1478.4 --> 1482.88
problem if they do

1480.799 --> 1483.84
because the vast majority just doesn't

1482.88 --> 1486.0800000000002
give a [ __ ]

1483.84 --> 1488.799
like we've heard enough to know it's all

1486.08 --> 1492.0
[ __ ] like even if it was real

1488.799 --> 1496.0
it's not effective while the detriments

1492.0 --> 1498.0
are measurable already so it's literally

1496.0 --> 1500.799
not worth it and hey if you want to

1498.0 --> 1502.96
freaking wear a mask you go ahead don't

1500.799 --> 1515.84
bother people with that [ __ ]

1502.96 --> 1515.8400000000001
that's the attitude and that's good

1517.52 --> 1521.36
uh eyes wide shut the right one will

1519.279 --> 1525.12
cross my path

1521.36 --> 1529.1999999999998
i i appreciate that you believe that

1525.12 --> 1532.9599999999998
this is thank you for the good wishes

1529.2 --> 1533.919
i too hope it but i'm not too sure even

1532.96 --> 1536.159
you know

1533.919 --> 1537.3600000000001
in the whole situation i'm not even too

1536.159 --> 1539.0390000000002
sure what

1537.36 --> 1542.8799999999999
what i'm looking for anymore you know

1539.039 --> 1546.1589999999999
i'm i'm used to

1542.88 --> 1549.279
in a peaceful environment you know but

1546.159 --> 1549.679
i've changed i've changed i've become a

1549.279 --> 1552.72
lot

1549.679 --> 1556.3200000000002
a lot more rough more

1552.72 --> 1556.799
like how do you say no more excuses kind

1556.32 --> 1559.84
of guy

1556.799 --> 1561.76
i'm just really rough-mouthed

1559.84 --> 1564.6399999999999
and really straightforward and i'm kind

1561.76 --> 1567.36
of tyrannical

1564.64 --> 1569.279
like my mind is tyrannical and i i don't

1567.36 --> 1571.76
want to hold it back anymore

1569.279 --> 1572.64
maybe that's also because of the heat

1571.76 --> 1577.6
but it's also

1572.64 --> 1582.0800000000002
just because i am confident enough

1577.6 --> 1584.6399999999999
that i should just do that i should just

1582.08 --> 1585.76
you know just show what it is and show

1584.64 --> 1587.5200000000002
that that's real

1585.76 --> 1590.48
maybe ignite some of it with other

1587.52 --> 1593.679
people in their spirits

1590.48 --> 1596.96
but also be very under control

1593.679 --> 1598.0
you know don't let those tyrannical

1596.96 --> 1601.919
words become

1598.0 --> 1605.279
tyrannical actions so easily

1601.919 --> 1605.279
because it's a big risk

1608.0 --> 1611.919
i wouldn't stop looking let nature run

1610.159 --> 1613.6000000000001
its course yeah well that is i am not

1611.919 --> 1617.679
really looking i'm literally

1613.6 --> 1619.36
looking like who just to notice like oh

1617.679 --> 1621.2
[ __ ] there's still quite a lot of hot

1619.36 --> 1623.36
chicks around

1621.2 --> 1624.96
and they might they might actually dig

1623.36 --> 1628.799
me like it

1624.96 --> 1631.039
but yeah how do i run into these people

1628.799 --> 1634.799
and how down how do i prevent making

1631.039 --> 1634.799
myself look like a complete idiot

1639.039 --> 1642.48
because when i really think a girl is

1641.2 --> 1644.559
really cute that

1642.48 --> 1646.72
kind of tends to happen that i'm i'm

1644.559 --> 1649.52
weird like that it's just

1646.72 --> 1649.919
i'm not used to it for a while and it's

1649.52 --> 1653.36
like

1649.919 --> 1654.0800000000002
really it just it's happening then yeah

1653.36 --> 1657.36
i i get

1654.08 --> 1659.9189999999999
so wound up by the energy

1657.36 --> 1662.08
that sometimes i feel like i'm gonna

1659.919 --> 1665.279
faint or throw up or something

1662.08 --> 1669.039
from the excitement it sounds silly but

1665.279 --> 1670.0
just it's yeah kind of sensitive to that

1669.039 --> 1673.679
[ __ ]

1670.0 --> 1673.679
it doesn't really wear off either

1681.44 --> 1685.919
but yeah i'm effectively not looking i'm

1684.08 --> 1688.48
not

1685.919 --> 1689.919
registering myself in some dating site

1688.48 --> 1694.84
or anything

1689.919 --> 1698.72
and then paying [ __ ] off no i but

1694.84 --> 1701.12
i i just know i need to

1698.72 --> 1703.039
do more things out there and but it i

1701.12 --> 1706.08
have to do it for me because i like it

1703.039 --> 1708.48
not because i want to meet people

1706.08 --> 1710.08
even though that will happen if that is

1708.48 --> 1712.799
the motivation it'll not

1710.08 --> 1714.32
work it'll not function the way it's

1712.799 --> 1716.48
supposed to

1714.32 --> 1717.6
so see that's a bit of a trick i kind of

1716.48 --> 1722.24
have to let it go

1717.6 --> 1722.24
in order for it to become real

1723.12 --> 1726.4799999999998
and it's always worked like that with me

1724.799 --> 1728.8799999999999
and girlfriends it's always when i

1726.48 --> 1730.08
truly am like okay i'm done with this

1728.88 --> 1732.159
[ __ ] i'm not gonna

1730.08 --> 1734.08
waste my time on it anymore and suddenly

1732.159 --> 1735.0390000000002
like this girl just pulls up to me like

1734.08 --> 1739.84
that that

1735.039 --> 1739.84
that's every time

1743.6 --> 1750.8799999999999
yeah but for that i have to basically

1747.679 --> 1753.3600000000001
live out there in the world and know

1750.88 --> 1757.6000000000001
what i want to do

1753.36 --> 1759.279
and see how can i connect with more

1757.6 --> 1761.76
people you know because yeah i can

1759.279 --> 1763.52
probably think of like tons of hobbies

1761.76 --> 1765.84
that i would be doing on my own and i'd

1763.52 --> 1767.12
be so happy that i'd be all on my own

1765.84 --> 1768.32
yeah but i'm not going to meet people

1767.12 --> 1771.36
that way

1768.32 --> 1772.08
so what would i do that would make me

1771.36 --> 1775.9189999999999
meet people

1772.08 --> 1781.84
and preferably types

1775.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
that will be good to me

1786.559 --> 1794.399
i sweatshirt to be direct well hey

1790.159 --> 1795.0390000000002
look if the opportunity is there and i'm

1794.399 --> 1798.9599999999998
up to it

1795.039 --> 1799.84
yeah once i can initiate oh yeah once

1798.96 --> 1804.0
that

1799.84 --> 1807.9189999999999
once the threshold is passed then it's

1804.0 --> 1809.84
no more problem i have no more problem

1807.919 --> 1810.96
my problem would be is that i'd be too

1809.84 --> 1814.32
direct

1810.96 --> 1816.96
not but in just intense ways

1814.32 --> 1818.399
like i did that even with my ex once we

1816.96 --> 1821.279
passed that threshold

1818.399 --> 1822.1589999999999
i was like no i want to live together

1821.279 --> 1825.279
with you

1822.159 --> 1826.159
i said that like after two weeks just

1825.279 --> 1829.6
like no i

1826.159 --> 1832.48
absolutely want like i

1829.6 --> 1834.32
really want yeah spend as long as i can

1832.48 --> 1837.84
with you

1834.32 --> 1837.84
i don't know that's not gonna change

1841.679 --> 1846.159
and she was kind of weirded out by that

1843.76 --> 1847.76
at first but then she actually really

1846.159 --> 1850.88
appreciated it

1847.76 --> 1854.399
i guess it gave her

1850.88 --> 1857.679
a feeling of stability like

1854.399 --> 1858.1589999999999
i really meant it and she could rely on

1857.679 --> 1862.64
that

1858.159 --> 1865.2
and she could rely on how i felt

1862.64 --> 1869.279
so yeah i don't know it's a it's a

1865.2 --> 1869.279
complex chemistry how that all works

1870.08 --> 1874.0
then you really have to be in the moment

1871.919 --> 1876.5590000000002
to just do it and

1874.0 --> 1879.84
because talk about it really is not all

1876.559 --> 1879.84
that helpful

1895.44 --> 1899.44
wow 26 years nice

1899.86 --> 1903.01
[Music]

1904.84 --> 1907.84
congratulations

1910.32 --> 1921.84
23rd wedding

1928.24 --> 1935.84
yeah my parents made it to 27 and then

1930.72 --> 1935.84
it absolutely exploded

1936.08 --> 1940.96
but yeah everybody saw that coming for

1938.88 --> 1944.159
some time

1940.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
because they had been arguing for yeah

1944.159 --> 1949.8400000000001
18 years roughly

1961.12 --> 1964.8799999999999
zero years for you amanda you

1968.799 --> 1975.36
yeah well i've never married either i

1971.84 --> 1975.36
did want to marry my ex but

1975.679 --> 1994.3200000000002
yeah how was it gonna work

1991.039 --> 1994.32
oh god really

1995.039 --> 2000.799
uh john bernards i despise that woman

2001.84 --> 2009.76
she is she's a scumbag

2006.0 --> 2012.32
she's a total politician two-faced liar

2009.76 --> 2015.12
she championed and then she's corrupted

2012.32 --> 2015.12
so badly

2015.279 --> 2018.64
i don't know you know she may still

2017.519 --> 2021.6
think

2018.64 --> 2024.5590000000002
somewhere inside that she's good but i

2021.6 --> 2024.559
kind of doubt it

2030.399 --> 2036.1589999999999
like i but i have extra hate for her i

2033.76 --> 2039.679
guess because also

2036.159 --> 2041.3600000000001
i did kind of we in the family in the

2039.679 --> 2044.48
90s were

2041.36 --> 2045.36
with roon links you know which she kind

2044.48 --> 2048.96
of championed it

2045.36 --> 2052.48
at the time and yeah to then

2048.96 --> 2054.96
see that whole party and her basically

2052.48 --> 2056.8
go with the tyrannical corruption

2054.96 --> 2058.7200000000003
erosion that has been happening like the

2056.8 --> 2060.159
social justice warrior revolution

2058.72 --> 2064.48
marxism all the

2060.159 --> 2068.079
the terrible terrible [ __ ] and the

2064.48 --> 2068.079
the whole co2 scam

2069.119 --> 2072.3990000000003
that's a lot because of her

2072.56 --> 2075.839
can't stand that woman

2080.32 --> 2083.679
and i'm probably not alone i think she

2082.399 --> 2086.839
got some people that

2083.679 --> 2089.839
really hate her guts probably worse than

2086.839 --> 2089.839
i

2102.8 --> 2106.48
all right see you later tiny wumbo

2104.4 --> 2109.52
thanks for being a chat

2106.48 --> 2111.52
i will do my best to keep it cool oh i

2109.52 --> 2116.99
got a melon

2111.52 --> 2120.08
yeah i'm gonna do that right now

2116.99 --> 2120.08
[Music]

2120.64 --> 2123.04
i see

2128.839 --> 2131.839
melon

2132.24 --> 2140.72
for just what is it for 2 euros

2135.92 --> 2140.7200000000003
20 cents this is insane right

2143.2 --> 2153.2799999999997
whoa that's green it smells great though

2147.44 --> 2153.28
i hope i didn't cut it too early

2154.8 --> 2162.079
maybe not ripe enough yet [ __ ]

2159.119 --> 2162.079
what do you guys think

2162.91 --> 2167.7599999999998
[Music]

2165.04 --> 2167.7599999999998
get out of here

2171.44 --> 2187.91
all right i don't know

2186.16 --> 2189.44
i'm gonna try it anyway

2187.91 --> 2201.839
[Music]

2189.44 --> 2201.839
and if it's a little too raw too bad

2207.839 --> 2215.839
hmm i don't think it's that bad

2218.59 --> 2221.719
[Music]

2236.77 --> 2242.15
[Music]

2238.4 --> 2245.219
let's see

2242.15 --> 2245.219
[Music]

2246.24 --> 2248.4799999999996
hmm

2250.0 --> 2257.839
yeah it's good i don't know why it's

2252.72 --> 2257.839
green but it's it's excellent

2268.96 --> 2271.839
anyway

2274.32 --> 2291.869
dude what the [ __ ] is going on

2284.26 --> 2291.869
[Music]

2300.8 --> 2308.1600000000003
trying to work something on the balcony

2304.24 --> 2308.16
there but it's yeah it's echoing all the

2310.839 --> 2313.839
way

2325.839 --> 2333.599
all right so how's anybody

2330.32 --> 2336.8
how's everybody doing missing the whole

2333.599 --> 2340.079
life nathan show to be fair like

2336.8 --> 2342.079
he he has so many good episodes

2340.079 --> 2343.119
together now that you could probably

2342.079 --> 2346.2400000000002
just

2343.119 --> 2349.44
do reruns of the good shows for like

2346.24 --> 2352.56
a month or so and and we'd barely even

2349.44 --> 2356.64
notice we'd be fine

2352.56 --> 2356.64
we'd still be amused some really good

2366.839 --> 2369.839
shows

2380.839 --> 2383.839
hmm

2390.56 --> 2394.24
iom videos what

2394.72 --> 2411.839
yeah but fesler his computer is down so

2413.44 --> 2425.839
uh yeah random explorer it's small

2426.96 --> 2429.28
hmm

2431.76 --> 2436.7200000000003
all those videos oh god and that would

2434.88 --> 2440.079
drive everybody nuts besides

2436.72 --> 2444.3999999999996
a lot of it is kind of outdated

2440.079 --> 2444.4
you know from the old times

2444.56 --> 2450.839
we were all on trains of thought that we

2446.319 --> 2453.839
have now over yeah we bypassed that by

2450.839 --> 2453.839
now

2458.56 --> 2461.7599999999998
we've outgrown them but

2461.839 --> 2465.04
i think there are still plenty of other

2463.359 --> 2467.44
times where we do

2465.04 --> 2469.2799999999997
also talk about the isle of man or even

2467.44 --> 2471.359
reference it

2469.28 --> 2472.48
how we thought then and how we thinking

2471.359 --> 2474.7999999999997
now yeah

2472.48 --> 2476.72
like two weeks ago or is it something

2474.8 --> 2481.8390000000004
like that

2476.72 --> 2481.839
i brought that up too you know

2491.839 --> 2497.599
what good servant what are you talking

2494.48 --> 2497.599
about i have no idea

2500.48 --> 2504.2400000000002
i'm pretty sure he doesn't affect the

2506.839 --> 2509.839
internet

2516.96 --> 2523.599
like the worst heat can do

2520.0 --> 2526.56
is be very tough on server space

2523.599 --> 2526.56
cooling equipment

2526.96 --> 2537.839
but yeah the bigger ones they have that

2530.319 --> 2537.839
accounted for so

2540.64 --> 2543.839
the worst they can do is just make the

2542.4 --> 2547.119
cooling

2543.839 --> 2549.599
the keeping the internet cool

2547.119 --> 2565.839
a little bit more expensive than normal

2549.599 --> 2565.839
that's it

2576.839 --> 2579.839
uh

2581.44 --> 2588.16
600 square feet well yeah that's all

2585.119 --> 2591.52
american sized

2588.16 --> 2595.2799999999997
like seriously like inland americans

2591.52 --> 2598.48
tend to complain about how small the

2595.28 --> 2599.6800000000003
houses and apartments become like in the

2598.48 --> 2603.359
more

2599.68 --> 2607.2799999999997
urban areas in america well

2603.359 --> 2610.64
news flash everywhere everywhere

2607.28 --> 2614.3300000000004
in the united states is huge everywhere

2610.64 --> 2615.68
compared to here so

2614.33 --> 2618.96
[Music]

2615.68 --> 2620.24
yeah those size apartments are all very

2618.96 --> 2635.839
luxurious here

2620.24 --> 2635.839
and expensive

2660.72 --> 2665.52
on the other hand in the netherlands it

2663.04 --> 2668.56
works all very differently

2665.52 --> 2669.44
so while it still will be kind of wild

2668.56 --> 2671.68
in prices in

2669.44 --> 2674.079
the united states with all that extra

2671.68 --> 2677.04
room also comes a lot more hassle from

2674.079 --> 2680.7200000000003
the outside

2677.04 --> 2683.119
and the [ __ ] here is bureaucracy and

2680.72 --> 2686.0789999999997
taxes

2683.119 --> 2688.88
and compared yeah those are those

2686.079 --> 2691.92
definitely tend to outweigh the overall

2688.88 --> 2696.8
criminal and harassment

2691.92 --> 2696.8
issues going around so

2701.44 --> 2705.839
50 square meters

2709.2 --> 2719.839
that's that's a lot

2723.79 --> 2726.98
[Music]

2731.84 --> 2734.9590000000003
[Music]

2744.839 --> 2747.839
hmm

2767.28 --> 2770.96
right well anyway it's all apartments

2769.839 --> 2773.119
and all that

2770.96 --> 2774.4
i don't even this is not an apartment is

2773.119 --> 2777.92
i'm just

2774.4 --> 2781.76
this room that's it

2777.92 --> 2781.76
and shared kitchen and bathroom and

2786.839 --> 2789.839
everything

2813.44 --> 2817.839
are they active good servant that's

2815.119 --> 2817.839
horrific

2818.079 --> 2822.319
that's a really bad they have constant

2821.359 --> 2824.0789999999997
wi-fi

2822.319 --> 2825.92
like i don't know if you know that but

2824.079 --> 2829.52
wi-fi is

2825.92 --> 2830.8
exactly the same as 5g

2829.52 --> 2834.8
if you have those [ __ ] things

2830.8 --> 2834.8
everywhere that's what are you doing

2843.52 --> 2849.28
so why are you having that what are you

2846.96 --> 2849.28
doing

2853.81 --> 2859.7599999999998
[Music]

2855.599 --> 2864.0
why is what is bad about it

2859.76 --> 2864.0
it's terrible for your cells

2864.079 --> 2869.04
like that type of radiation especially

2866.16 --> 2872.24
if you're actually using it constantly

2869.04 --> 2874.16
it's like putting yourself in a slow low

2872.24 --> 2887.839
grade microwave

2874.16 --> 2887.839
the damage eventually starts to compound

2898.839 --> 2901.839
hmm

2912.839 --> 2918.319
so

2915.2 --> 2922.16
yeah i do everything wired i i

2918.319 --> 2923.92
avoid wi-fi at all costs

2922.16 --> 2929.839
i don't use wireless internet on the

2923.92 --> 2929.839
mobile i'd never do it

2934.319 --> 2942.1
the wires are great they work much

2936.0 --> 2945.34
better anyway

2942.1 --> 2945.3399999999997
[Music]

2951.58 --> 2954.67
[Music]

2954.839 --> 2957.839
hmm

2965.68 --> 2969.2
well george sanford that that's

2968.559 --> 2972.88
different

2969.2 --> 2974.72
look wi-fi routers have definite

2972.88 --> 2976.2400000000002
yeah they have advanced you know they

2974.72 --> 2977.839
have all these different types of

2976.24 --> 2980.64
frequencies but if you're gonna

2977.839 --> 2981.52
run wireless internet these days then

2980.64 --> 2984.72
they usually

2981.52 --> 2986.72
switch like heavy traffic then they

2984.72 --> 2988.0
they tend to switch to the higher

2986.72 --> 2992.8799999999997
technologies which

2988.0 --> 2992.88
go and border wi-fi yeah the 5g

2995.2 --> 2999.2
like most of them if you buy one now

2997.44 --> 3001.599
it'll just say that in the instruction

2999.2 --> 3001.5989999999997
manual

3003.68 --> 3007.9199999999996
so i've heard because i'm not even

3006.64 --> 3011.1189999999997
interested in trying

3007.92 --> 3014.2400000000002
to get those things i don't use it

3011.119 --> 3014.2400000000002
i'm a wired guy

3024.839 --> 3027.839
hmm

3045.44 --> 3051.359
oh dear youtube's crashed

3052.839 --> 3055.839
again

3064.319 --> 3074.96
your phone still says 4g okay

3069.28 --> 3074.96
well 4g is not healthy either

3075.68 --> 3080.7999999999997
but yeah it's it's not nearly as bad as

3080.839 --> 3085.839
5g

3082.8 --> 3087.92
but yeah with 4g you definitely have to

3085.839 --> 3090.0789999999997
keep it away like a meter or half a

3087.92 --> 3092.88
meter from your head

3090.079 --> 3094.7200000000003
they even say that with the phones in

3092.88 --> 3096.4
the instructions

3094.72 --> 3098.9599999999996
you have to keep distance that's why

3096.4 --> 3101.04
they have to speaker function

3098.96 --> 3102.559
technically they shouldn't even have

3101.04 --> 3105.68
like an ear

3102.559 --> 3106.48
microphone function because you're never

3105.68 --> 3111.839
supposed to

3106.48 --> 3111.839
hold the phone next to your head

3124.72 --> 3139.839
yes random explorer i know

3152.39 --> 3155.489
[Music]

3158.72 --> 3164.72
good servant i don't know

3162.079 --> 3167.76
it could be that a lot of them simply

3164.72 --> 3171.359
already have the technology in them

3167.76 --> 3174.8
maybe even for a decade and they're just

3171.359 --> 3177.359
waiting for it to be initiated

3174.8 --> 3179.119
you know all these technology mega

3177.359 --> 3180.72
corporations they've planned everything

3179.119 --> 3183.44
ahead probably

3180.72 --> 3183.4399999999996
50 years

3183.76 --> 3187.5200000000004
so yeah for them it's like yeah now it's

3186.64 --> 3189.68
the time

3187.52 --> 3191.599
where we are gonna do the 5g and of

3189.68 --> 3194.16
course everything has already been

3191.599 --> 3195.44
built for that's easy ready plan it all

3194.16 --> 3198.5589999999997
out

3195.44 --> 3200.4
to basically if we get people as far as

3198.559 --> 3204.0
stupid as to do that

3200.4 --> 3206.559
that we could either yeah cause

3204.0 --> 3207.44
havoc with it if needed or just put a

3206.559 --> 3210.6400000000003
warm blanket

3207.44 --> 3213.28
oh look how well it works oh yeah

3210.64 --> 3216.48
because they spent so much time already

3213.28 --> 3216.48
working towards that

3218.24 --> 3222.0
but a lot yeah a lot of technology

3220.88 --> 3225.44
you're going to be buying

3222.0 --> 3228.48
it already has other things in it

3225.44 --> 3231.68
for the future and

3228.48 --> 3233.28
yeah it's i yeah it doesn't always even

3231.68 --> 3235.2
say if it has that

3233.28 --> 3236.559
although i think legally they must at

3235.2 --> 3238.24
this point

3236.559 --> 3240.559
i'm just saying like oh yeah it has this

3238.24 --> 3251.839
and that that

3240.559 --> 3251.8390000000004
and doesn't work yet

3256.88 --> 3265.839
okay hello ramit

3268.4 --> 3271.839
the 5g in the mountains yes that would

3270.48 --> 3276.839
be ridiculous but look

3271.839 --> 3279.839
5g is just a it's a local network system

3276.839 --> 3279.839
so

3280.079 --> 3286.799
you know with the typical cell towers

3283.119 --> 3288.88
from the 4g which reach pretty far

3286.799 --> 3289.839
they have a problem with mountains and

3288.88 --> 3292.48
trees

3289.839 --> 3293.359
the most because they just want singular

3292.48 --> 3297.04
towers

3293.359 --> 3298.0
away enough from civilization because

3297.04 --> 3300.0
yeah close by

3298.0 --> 3301.04
definitely does damage for that's the

3300.0 --> 3305.2
problem with 4g

3301.04 --> 3310.319
towers they do damage like within a mile

3305.2 --> 3310.319
measurable you can't live there

3310.4 --> 3313.599
and if you do then you're probably going

3311.92 --> 3317.04
to die of cancer

3313.599 --> 3319.119
serious so trees and [ __ ] will die

3317.04 --> 3320.4
and yeah you're lucky if grass grows

3319.119 --> 3323.76
there

3320.4 --> 3325.89
but usually they're high up enough so

3323.76 --> 3327.2000000000003
it doesn't like kill the grass

3325.89 --> 3329.839
[Music]

3327.2 --> 3331.5989999999997
but yeah 4g towers have problem with

3329.839 --> 3333.7599999999998
mountains because then

3331.599 --> 3337.04
yeah hours how is that tower going to be

3333.76 --> 3340.1600000000003
far enough away and still

3337.04 --> 3342.319
be able to reach the just the street

3340.16 --> 3345.04
level

3342.319 --> 3345.839
of the place it yeah it wants to reach

3345.04 --> 3347.839
you know

3345.839 --> 3349.839
when 5g is very different because it's

3347.839 --> 3352.4
so close by it's basically just a

3349.839 --> 3356.4
network of wireless

3352.4 --> 3359.44
because 5g does not reach very far

3356.4 --> 3361.52
when it does reach it

3359.44 --> 3363.2000000000003
is pretty intense and the closer why you

3361.52 --> 3365.68
get it becomes very

3363.2 --> 3365.68
intense

3366.64 --> 3370.4
if it's used like if there's people that

3369.52 --> 3374.079
like if there's

3370.4 --> 3375.599
10 people downloading [ __ ] over it

3374.079 --> 3377.44
and you're gonna stand right next to a

3375.599 --> 3380.1600000000003
sensor yeah that's not going to be very

3377.44 --> 3380.16
healthy for you

3384.96 --> 3389.68
so 5g would actually function better in

3387.839 --> 3390.72
mountainous areas because it wouldn't

3389.68 --> 3394.0
have that issue

3390.72 --> 3395.7599999999998
as with 4g towers but i wouldn't

3394.0 --> 3399.119
recommend it anyway

3395.76 --> 3403.0400000000004
just use freaking wires

3399.119 --> 3407.76
wires stop being a snob

3403.04 --> 3410.16
you don't need wireless get a computer

3407.76 --> 3412.3190000000004
hey and you you all want to do it

3410.16 --> 3413.44
through your wireless pad or something

3412.319 --> 3415.2
you know there's a lot of these people

3413.44 --> 3417.599
that i don't want to wear because i walk

3415.2 --> 3419.68
around a lot with my thing

3417.599 --> 3420.6400000000003
that's fine don't make the whole city

3419.68 --> 3423.04
that

3420.64 --> 3425.5989999999997
if you want that then build wires wires

3423.04 --> 3428.96
wires and you get one

3425.599 --> 3429.76
wi-fi router you can enter specially

3428.96 --> 3431.92
attuned to

3429.76 --> 3433.92
your thing that you want to do with in

3431.92 --> 3436.559
your house

3433.92 --> 3438.559
and then you have this one thing that

3436.559 --> 3439.3590000000004
radiates and it's not going to bother a

3438.559 --> 3442.96
lot of people

3439.359 --> 3445.2799999999997
around only in the house see

3442.96 --> 3446.0
that's the way to apply it properly

3445.28 --> 3448.559
that's honest

3446.0 --> 3449.359
that's better if you really want to use

3448.559 --> 3452.96
it then

3449.359 --> 3456.0789999999997
don't force it on other people

3452.96 --> 3456.079
just use wires

3457.119 --> 3460.6400000000003
if you're afraid you're going to trip

3458.72 --> 3462.8799999999997
over those wires then yeah

3460.64 --> 3464.48
take the last part of the wire system

3462.88 --> 3466.799
you put in place

3464.48 --> 3468.72
and put a wi-fi router or whatever so

3466.799 --> 3470.4
that you can do your wireless contact

3468.72 --> 3472.48
thingy with your

3470.4 --> 3474.319
ipad or phone or whatever you want to

3472.48 --> 3479.119
use and walk around with

3474.319 --> 3479.119
that you don't want to wire on you know

3483.92 --> 3489.359
i know i know agm you can turn wireless

3486.559 --> 3489.3590000000004
off in your router

3491.44 --> 3495.68
problem is though that it can even be

3493.44 --> 3499.52
remotely turned on

3495.68 --> 3499.52
yeah did you know that

3500.16 --> 3503.839
so it is

3508.559 --> 3517.8390000000004
is what it is

3518.559 --> 3525.6800000000003
no fuzzler no

3522.079 --> 3527.8390000000004
look wires it's a bit of a hassle

3525.68 --> 3529.2799999999997
as i already said yeah i'm not going to

3527.839 --> 3532.5589999999997
force other people to

3529.28 --> 3533.92
only use wires it's just that it's

3532.559 --> 3537.8390000000004
healthier it's better

3533.92 --> 3540.4
it's better for everything in this way

3537.839 --> 3542.5589999999997
the one using the wireless is not going

3540.4 --> 3545.839
to bother other people is not going to

3542.559 --> 3545.8390000000004
burden other people's health

3547.04 --> 3550.0
because it does

3551.04 --> 3556.079
so yeah i'm not forcing wires on

3554.4 --> 3559.119
everyone

3556.079 --> 3561.28
it's just that those people

3559.119 --> 3562.96
that use it don't know what the [ __ ]

3561.28 --> 3565.28
they're doing

3562.96 --> 3568.0
they're all gonna have terrible problems

3565.28 --> 3568.0
when they're older

3568.48 --> 3572.2400000000002
they're gonna be sick and die from

3570.16 --> 3575.44
cancer you know there's already

3572.24 --> 3577.2
a lot of people from the earlier phone

3575.44 --> 3578.799
situation the wireless phone that

3577.2 --> 3581.9199999999996
already have that

3578.799 --> 3585.359
they already died right

3581.92 --> 3587.2000000000003
think that's that's the only part no no

3585.359 --> 3588.48
now the technology is getting worse it's

3587.2 --> 3589.2
getting stronger it's getting more

3588.48 --> 3594.2400000000002
invasive

3589.2 --> 3596.8799999999997
the technology companies care less now

3594.24 --> 3598.72
they're becoming more openly eugenesis

3596.88 --> 3603.44
so they see

3598.72 --> 3605.52
the destruction as a good thing

3603.44 --> 3606.96
while they deny it exist for legal

3605.52 --> 3608.88
purposes and all that

3606.96 --> 3611.2
of course because they're not gonna pay

3608.88 --> 3613.2000000000003
for it

3611.2 --> 3614.319
but yeah when they talk among one

3613.2 --> 3618.48
another yeah they

3614.319 --> 3620.72
like it i think it's good

3618.48 --> 3621.839
like good you want to do that then kill

3620.72 --> 3625.359
yourself

3621.839 --> 3626.96
that's the way to do it yeah

3625.359 --> 3629.839
because otherwise they wouldn't be doing

3626.96 --> 3629.839
all this

3629.92 --> 3636.079
they would just have perfect

3633.28 --> 3638.0
crystal clear internet wire systems

3636.079 --> 3640.96
everywhere

3638.0 --> 3642.799
maybe a couple of wireless systems

3640.96 --> 3644.48
they're very careful

3642.799 --> 3647.119
and they're not just gonna pump out

3644.48 --> 3649.44
wireless things and very cheap like oh

3647.119 --> 3652.7200000000003
take this take this take this

3649.44 --> 3657.839
and like watch the [ __ ] watch streamed

3652.72 --> 3657.839
movies on your phone all day

3659.2 --> 3664.5589999999997
yeah probably half of you are actually

3661.52 --> 3664.559
doing that right now

3665.2 --> 3668.0
it's your problem

3668.319 --> 3672.0
i'd recommend you get a computer and use

3670.88 --> 3674.88
a wire

3672.0 --> 3674.88
to watch my show

3675.44 --> 3681.76
and hey with a desktop computer or a

3677.92 --> 3681.76
laptop you have a much bigger screen

3682.839 --> 3685.839
anyway

3693.839 --> 3699.92
that's now upstairs moretz

3698.16 --> 3701.2799999999997
now there's definitely something that

3699.92 --> 3704.799
can be done about it

3701.28 --> 3704.799
can all be shut down

3708.559 --> 3714.48
just blow it all up almost use the word

3712.4 --> 3718.2400000000002
that i shouldn't

3714.48 --> 3720.2400000000002
but yeah no oh no yeah they may

3718.24 --> 3722.0789999999997
want to do it they may even get away

3720.24 --> 3723.9199999999996
with it for a short time but when the

3722.079 --> 3728.079
detriment start

3723.92 --> 3741.839
that's when it's just like okay

3728.079 --> 3741.8390000000004
how are we going to blow this up

3745.2 --> 3748.799
there are no satellites for starters

3747.68 --> 3750.96
that's moretz

3748.799 --> 3752.0
okay if there's like a hovering thing up

3750.96 --> 3755.52
there

3752.0 --> 3756.079
yeah that's that's really not that tough

3755.52 --> 3759.92
you know

3756.079 --> 3763.119
satellites or whatever satellites or

3759.92 --> 3763.92
drones that can fly very long yeah

3763.119 --> 3768.0
they're not

3763.92 --> 3770.559
uh specifically designed to evade

3768.0 --> 3783.839
destruction so that's not going to be

3770.559 --> 3783.8390000000004
too hard

3784.64 --> 3797.839
they're not hovering i've seen them what

3799.599 --> 3803.839
things up there well what if there are

3802.079 --> 3805.039
zero things up there have you ever

3803.839 --> 3806.88
considered that

3805.039 --> 3808.8390000000004
have you ever considered that the whole

3806.88 --> 3810.079
thing might just be ground-based

3808.839 --> 3813.119
technology

3810.079 --> 3817.44
where they basically figured out

3813.119 --> 3821.359
how to how did they used to say it

3817.44 --> 3823.92
bounce signals off the ionosphere

3821.359 --> 3824.5589999999997
what they used to say right so yeah well

3823.92 --> 3826.2400000000002
maybe

3824.559 --> 3827.92
they don't have freaking satellites the

3826.24 --> 3831.68
satellites are just another

3827.92 --> 3833.92
stupid baller cover cover story

3831.68 --> 3836.319
it's just a ground device maybe even

3833.92 --> 3836.319
like a

3836.96 --> 3844.079
harp system but specific for

3840.88 --> 3847.44
data transfer and it's just like

3844.079 --> 3850.319
bouncing off the top

3847.44 --> 3852.96
the top of the realm whatever it may be

3850.319 --> 3855.2
whether it is that energy shield barrier

3852.96 --> 3856.2400000000002
or what whatever is beyond they probably

3855.2 --> 3858.0
know

3856.24 --> 3860.8799999999997
and they're just doing it like that so

3858.0 --> 3864.079
it's just a big bouncy signal thing

3860.88 --> 3865.76
there's no things hanging up there

3864.079 --> 3867.44
if there's anything hanging up there

3865.76 --> 3872.3190000000004
it's going to be

3867.44 --> 3872.319
artificially created holographic lights

3872.48 --> 3881.839
like altered stars

3904.48 --> 3910.2400000000002
yeah that's really nice john jacob

3907.599 --> 3911.28
but there's no satellites that doesn't

3910.24 --> 3914.4799999999996
exist

3911.28 --> 3917.8390000000004
the concept of satellites doesn't exist

3914.48 --> 3923.76
it's fiction there is no orbit

3917.839 --> 3937.839
you can't fall perpetually in a circle

3923.76 --> 3937.8390000000004
that's science fiction doesn't exist

3947.2 --> 3950.48
what the motivation for a mega scale

3949.119 --> 3953.76
live would be

3950.48 --> 3956.96
well having control over what is real

3953.76 --> 3959.2000000000003
and giving yourself the justified reason

3956.96 --> 3961.119
to hate people because they were stupid

3959.2 --> 3964.3999999999996
enough to be fooled by you

3961.119 --> 3967.039
with everything and then you can

3964.4 --> 3968.079
sort of judicially very evil people can

3967.039 --> 3970.88
just claim that

3968.079 --> 3972.319
yeah they have your soul because you you

3970.88 --> 3973.76
were fooled in everything so they have

3972.319 --> 3977.0389999999998
the right to do with you

3973.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
whatever they wish that's the freaking

3977.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
motivation

3997.28 --> 4001.599
i'm gonna put this melon back in the

3999.44 --> 4002.88
cooler because it's a little too raw i

4001.599 --> 4006.2400000000002
hope

4002.88 --> 4008.7200000000003
it's not gonna spoil now maybe i should

4006.24 --> 4021.839
just leave it out in the open

4008.72 --> 4021.839
i think i'll do that

4032.839 --> 4035.839
uh

4046.839 --> 4049.839
so

4102.839 --> 4105.839
okay

4106.56 --> 4111.839000000001
yes some things it's so tough right well

4109.52 --> 4115.040000000001
look satellites

4111.839 --> 4117.6
been purposely been

4115.04 --> 4119.839
put in the faces of little children for

4117.6 --> 4123.120000000001
a long time they put that in there

4119.839 --> 4126.88
specifically to

4123.12 --> 4130.239
make it normal so that you will

4126.88 --> 4133.679
very very easily assume and find

4130.239 --> 4134.08
natural the idea of the earth being a

4133.679 --> 4138.0
ball

4134.08 --> 4141.92
or anything being a ball any planet

4138.0 --> 4144.239
and a technological box with a saucer on

4141.92 --> 4146.64
it and a couple of sunrise panels

4144.239 --> 4148.4
to be able to fall around it and with

4146.64 --> 4150.159000000001
the animation and the pictures and the

4148.4 --> 4153.3589999999995
stories

4150.159 --> 4156.159
because yeah they just want you to think

4153.359 --> 4157.679
that that is a default normal it's part

4156.159 --> 4160.44
of the bigger conditioning

4157.679 --> 4162.4
it's an icon it's an it's icon of

4160.44 --> 4166.08
iconography

4162.4 --> 4169.679
like the satellite is one of the saints

4166.08 --> 4175.04
of the globe religion that's

4169.679 --> 4177.839
like put put in your face very early

4175.04 --> 4180.08
because at the same time if you're just

4177.839 --> 4181.759
you don't understand

4180.08 --> 4184.239
yeah then you think oh yeah satellites

4181.759 --> 4186.96
that's really technologically advanced

4184.239 --> 4189.599999999999
i'm going to teach my kid about that

4186.96 --> 4191.279
because i'm very proud that i'm part of

4189.6 --> 4192.319
something that's so technologically

4191.279 --> 4195.52
advanced

4192.319 --> 4198.080000000001
that i'm part of that the space

4195.52 --> 4199.120000000001
society see that's the trick you get

4198.08 --> 4202.4
fooled

4199.12 --> 4204.8
and so it's normalized

4202.4 --> 4206.4
to your kids because yeah my parents too

4204.8 --> 4208.64
you know they they were they didn't know

4206.4 --> 4208.639999999999
that

4210.17 --> 4213.31
[Music]

4213.52 --> 4220.400000000001
so it's just very easy to believe

4216.88 --> 4220.400000000001
that a satellite could exist

4228.84 --> 4231.84
sputnik

4240.159 --> 4248.08
russians in cahoots with the us

4243.199 --> 4249.839999999999
well no not directly

4248.08 --> 4252.239
but they were certainly those

4249.84 --> 4254.400000000001
departments

4252.239 --> 4255.44
that dealt with the space situations

4254.4 --> 4258.0
that were

4255.44 --> 4259.759999999999
conspiring together but it's like cons

4258.0 --> 4260.88
they're conspiring against the whole

4259.76 --> 4265.1990000000005
world

4260.88 --> 4268.159000000001
to uphold that lie they don't care

4265.199 --> 4269.44
which they yeah it's about that their

4268.159 --> 4270.96
idea wins

4269.44 --> 4273.839999999999
no matter what they don't care about the

4270.96 --> 4273.84
countries

4278.56 --> 4283.52
often laced with like this

4280.76 --> 4288.320000000001
internationalism and

4283.52 --> 4291.52
globalism you know literally globalism

4288.32 --> 4292.48
that's all part of what yeah what that's

4291.52 --> 4301.84
like

4292.48 --> 4301.839999999999
that's where that is promoted

4303.76 --> 4309.679
no you have to realize that in a way

4306.8 --> 4313.4400000000005
i think that even governments themselves

4309.679 --> 4317.52
during that time didn't really realize

4313.44 --> 4320.96
that what that was

4317.52 --> 4323.92
in a way or maybe they did nah

4320.96 --> 4323.92
they probably did

4326.32 --> 4330.0
but yeah maybe they just believed it

4327.92 --> 4330.4800000000005
maybe they just believed that space

4330.0 --> 4334.719
could

4330.48 --> 4336.5599999999995
this this trick could unite the world

4334.719 --> 4338.4800000000005
they might have seen that as a positive

4336.56 --> 4340.0
thing like star trek idea

4338.48 --> 4341.5199999999995
they didn't know yet that it was

4340.0 --> 4344.56
actually supposed to become

4341.52 --> 4345.280000000001
total hell with a bunch of freaks at the

4344.56 --> 4347.92
top

4345.28 --> 4350.48
that just want to make everybody suffer

4347.92 --> 4354.4800000000005
wither and die

4350.48 --> 4358.159
so yeah

4354.48 --> 4371.839999999999
don't know back in the day people were

4358.159 --> 4371.839999999999
already on to that

4372.4 --> 4376.4
didn't sputnik broadcast a signal that

4374.4 --> 4377.36
could be heard by anyone with the right

4376.4 --> 4380.639999999999
equipment

4377.36 --> 4381.839999999999
well didn't you know that what's called

4380.64 --> 4385.84
the

4381.84 --> 4387.52
am radio you can hear that halfway

4385.84 --> 4391.84
around the world

4387.52 --> 4394.96
you know from just a tower admittedly

4391.84 --> 4396.8
i don't really talk about it but like

4394.96 --> 4400.08
even in the 80s

4396.8 --> 4403.360000000001
i could pick up like russian radio

4400.08 --> 4404.29
from moscow or something

4403.36 --> 4406.88
by accident

4404.29 --> 4410.8
[Music]

4406.88 --> 4414.400000000001
it would kind of like leak through

4410.8 --> 4418.159000000001
so yes oh signal from sputnik yeah

4414.4 --> 4419.759999999999
that's just a freaking radio signal

4418.159 --> 4427.839999999999
they probably juiced it up a little bit

4419.76 --> 4427.84
more than usual

4452.84 --> 4455.84
what

4462.0 --> 4464.32
uh

4466.84 --> 4469.84
what

4471.76 --> 4475.52
what do you mean they won are you saying

4474.719 --> 4480.719
that they won

4475.52 --> 4497.84
and then surrendered with the deal

4480.719 --> 4497.84
that's weird i don't know about that

4500.719 --> 4504.32
yeah i don't know i'd have to hear a lot

4503.6 --> 4511.84
more

4504.32 --> 4511.84
historically backed data about that

4532.08 --> 4539.84
all right more colored well yeah

4540.159 --> 4544.799999999999
now but i think by the time that the war

4542.239 --> 4547.839999999999
was being fought

4544.8 --> 4551.12
any original ideas

4547.84 --> 4553.4400000000005
were kind of like gone you know remember

4551.12 --> 4557.76
that back in the day

4553.44 --> 4562.08
like america was like very much

4557.76 --> 4563.4400000000005
in ways well not nazi sympathizers they

4562.08 --> 4565.6
were

4563.44 --> 4567.36
they yeah they were about the eugenics

4565.6 --> 4570.64
they kind of promoted it they

4567.36 --> 4571.28
they dude wasn't disney the one also

4570.64 --> 4574.0
officially

4571.28 --> 4575.199
making like helping them out with movies

4574.0 --> 4579.52
or something

4575.199 --> 4582.5599999999995
i'm not uh not too sure how exactly

4579.52 --> 4585.040000000001
that all fit but yeah there was

4582.56 --> 4587.6
all kinds of sympathy going on before

4585.04 --> 4595.84
the actual war started

4587.6 --> 4595.84
and then that all changed

4598.4 --> 4603.759999999999
so i don't think it could have worked

4599.84 --> 4603.76
you know paper clip is really just

4603.92 --> 4608.0
sort of like a slavery situations like

4606.08 --> 4610.4
okay no we're just going to steal these

4608.0 --> 4612.4
people they yeah because otherwise

4610.4 --> 4615.199
they're probably going to be executed

4612.4 --> 4617.5199999999995
or stolen by somebody else like by

4615.199 --> 4622.08
russia for example

4617.52 --> 4624.4800000000005
they were probably trying as well

4622.08 --> 4626.48
but yeah the idea that it was all sort

4624.48 --> 4637.839999999999
of a plan

4626.48 --> 4637.839999999999
that seems just illogical

4659.12 --> 4665.36
yeah hey jim that's great

4663.44 --> 4679.839999999999
i'm using one of their processors in my

4665.36 --> 4679.839999999999
computer right now

4689.24 --> 4693.84
[Music]

4690.84 --> 4693.84
hey

4704.84 --> 4707.84
so

4708.8 --> 4713.28
must be a bit dated no no of course not

4717.28 --> 4722.719
but they basically they didn't cease to

4720.239 --> 4722.718999999999
exist

4723.6 --> 4735.84
they just yeah changed brands

4778.08 --> 4781.28
this is sounding like a captain america

4780.08 --> 4791.84
movie

4781.28 --> 4791.84
it is a bit isn't it right

4816.84 --> 4819.84
so

4822.8 --> 4833.84
all right

4842.4 --> 4847.839999999999
all right the puzzler see you later

4849.04 --> 4861.84
don't forget the robinsons

4864.56 --> 4871.52
no yeah i'm i'm with that one i think

4867.12 --> 4871.5199999999995
that hitler probably went to argentine

4872.84 --> 4875.84
argentina

4875.91 --> 4878.989
[Music]

4914.84 --> 4917.84
hmm

4930.08 --> 4945.84
that's interesting idea

5004.48 --> 5007.7
[Music]

5028.639 --> 5033.679
ugh i'm going to turn on the fan again

5030.96 --> 5033.679
because it's hot

5033.76 --> 5043.84
like dozing off here

5054.84 --> 5060.6990000000005
so

5057.56 --> 5060.6990000000005
[Music]

5064.159 --> 5066.638999999999
no i

5069.28 --> 5073.84
trendy p why what why would you call it

5072.48 --> 5078.48
that

5073.84 --> 5078.4800000000005
what agm

5078.56 --> 5085.84
but yeah it's pretty bad and that woman

5081.199 --> 5085.839999999999
is terrible

5101.28 --> 5113.84
what self-admitted or are you just

5104.639 --> 5113.84
saying that

5130.639 --> 5134.400000000001
oh yeah yeah well don't do that here

5132.96 --> 5136.56
it's not allowed

5134.4 --> 5138.48
you're not gonna call people [ __ ]

5136.56 --> 5142.96
unless it's like

5138.48 --> 5142.959999999999
very very highly suggested

5143.36 --> 5147.92
like with michael and obama for example

5146.639 --> 5155.84
you know

5147.92 --> 5155.84
big crutchford what the [ __ ]

5158.4 --> 5162.638999999999
why would it matter even

5162.88 --> 5169.1990000000005
why don't we just focus on the

5166.0 --> 5172.88
brazen crime and

5169.199 --> 5175.5199999999995
psychological assault on the rights and

5172.88 --> 5178.159000000001
in the psyche of the people i think

5175.52 --> 5181.6
that's a little bit higher in priority

5178.159 --> 5197.839999999999
whether she has a penis or not okay

5181.6 --> 5197.84
seriously guys stop doing that

5203.36 --> 5206.799999999999
right well yeah serious mental disorders

5206.159 --> 5210.719
but

5206.8 --> 5213.679
yeah hello the actions

5210.719 --> 5215.12
it doesn't freaking matter what they

5213.679 --> 5217.84
have in their trousers

5215.12 --> 5217.84
who cares

5219.04 --> 5223.04
it's what they're doing and hey if

5221.199 --> 5225.44
they're doing disgusting things

5223.04 --> 5226.239
with what they have in their trousers

5225.44 --> 5229.839999999999
and yeah

5226.239 --> 5232.239
like children or something but

5229.84 --> 5235.12
why would it matter it doesn't matter

5232.239 --> 5236.879999999999
only the actions matter

5235.12 --> 5238.159
and i think there's plenty of actions

5236.88 --> 5241.1990000000005
that you don't need

5238.159 --> 5245.199
to look in that place in order to find

5241.199 --> 5247.599999999999
something to hold on to

5245.199 --> 5247.599999999999
right

5248.48 --> 5254.959999999999
just don't hold on

5251.52 --> 5257.679
to those secret dicks that you think

5254.96 --> 5267.84
people might have because guess what

5257.679 --> 5267.84
you're doing you're holding on to a dick

5272.4 --> 5276.879999999999
yeah it came from agm john jacob

5289.36 --> 5293.12
they play the game i don't give a [ __ ]

5292.159 --> 5295.04
it doesn't

5293.12 --> 5296.4
matter it only matters what they do i

5295.04 --> 5297.92
don't give a [ __ ] what they have in

5296.4 --> 5301.28
their crotch

5297.92 --> 5304.88
you know it's not even your business

5301.28 --> 5308.4
leech it's none of your [ __ ] business

5304.88 --> 5311.76
why would you it doesn't matter stop

5308.4 --> 5313.599999999999
like sexually obsessing over evil people

5311.76 --> 5315.04
that's what that is you're holding on to

5313.6 --> 5318.159000000001
somebody's dick

5315.04 --> 5319.6
stop doing it it doesn't matter why

5318.159 --> 5320.638999999999
don't you stick to the things they

5319.6 --> 5323.92
actually do

5320.639 --> 5324.719
the actual damage they do talk about

5323.92 --> 5327.04
that

5324.719 --> 5329.28
stop holding on to somebody's virtual

5327.04 --> 5329.28
dick

5332.88 --> 5339.6
yeah logical phallus

5336.56 --> 5343.6
stop it yeah

5339.6 --> 5345.1990000000005
it's disgusting agm it's it's [ __ ]

5343.6 --> 5349.280000000001
obsession it's disgusting

5345.199 --> 5349.28
it's one step away from sauvogne

5349.36 --> 5355.28
a lot of people have it and they're all

5351.52 --> 5358.4800000000005
holding on to somebody's dick

5355.28 --> 5365.84
it's gay all right

5358.48 --> 5365.839999999999
let me just say it like that it's gay

5369.52 --> 5379.84
why don't you focus on their actions

5419.28 --> 5421.84
hmm

5427.92 --> 5433.28
well you know mark collard look i i was

5430.239 --> 5435.919999999999
thinking about what you said earlier and

5433.28 --> 5436.4
in a literal sense you're not correct

5435.92 --> 5439.28
but

5436.4 --> 5440.638999999999
in a covert sense you might have been

5439.28 --> 5444.159
correct

5440.639 --> 5445.76
you know technically

5444.159 --> 5447.839999999999
there is always with countries and

5445.76 --> 5450.320000000001
nations and the bigger players even the

5447.84 --> 5452.2390000000005
evil ones there is always

5450.32 --> 5453.759999999999
sacred meetings and [ __ ] always it

5452.239 --> 5456.638999999999
always happens

5453.76 --> 5458.4800000000005
so i don't know i could imagine that

5456.639 --> 5460.8
there might have been some kind of a

5458.48 --> 5464.159
weird deal

5460.8 --> 5465.679
where hitler basically was going to lose

5464.159 --> 5467.599999999999
the war

5465.679 --> 5469.679
he knew that he couldn't make it in how

5467.6 --> 5470.96
the situation presented so he then

5469.679 --> 5473.52
devised an exit

5470.96 --> 5476.2390000000005
strategy only for himself so he didn't

5473.52 --> 5479.280000000001
inform anyone of it right

5476.239 --> 5484.32
kept it all secret and the deal was okay

5479.28 --> 5486.8
america you give us cover for my escape

5484.32 --> 5489.12
i'll even we'll even give you some

5486.8 --> 5492.159000000001
strategical advantages

5489.12 --> 5495.679
during the actual yeah

5492.159 --> 5499.04
war situation and

5495.679 --> 5500.8
yeah let us escape and you'll get

5499.04 --> 5502.08
like we'll make sure that you get the

5500.8 --> 5505.84
scientists you want

5502.08 --> 5505.84
as a payoff

5507.679 --> 5514.2390000000005
see now there is a

5511.12 --> 5516.5599999999995
idea that's halfway feasible in my

5514.239 --> 5519.199
opinion

5516.56 --> 5520.719
that it was just a secret deal before

5519.199 --> 5522.719
secret service gave

5520.719 --> 5524.4800000000005
the american secret service gave cover

5522.719 --> 5526.88
or whatever for him to escape to

5524.48 --> 5529.919999999999
argentina

5526.88 --> 5531.4400000000005
and then america could be like the big

5529.92 --> 5532.88
winner

5531.44 --> 5535.04
with a little bit of help from the

5532.88 --> 5536.96
inside

5535.04 --> 5539.12
and then they got the biggest payoff and

5536.96 --> 5541.36
then

5539.12 --> 5543.76
they may ensure with hollywood and all

5541.36 --> 5546.0
that that the historical narrative would

5543.76 --> 5547.6
all be placed in order

5546.0 --> 5550.0
yeah for everybody to kind of just

5547.6 --> 5551.52
forget about hitler

5550.0 --> 5553.92
everybody wanted to forget about it

5551.52 --> 5553.92
anyway

5554.8 --> 5557.28
probably

5559.199 --> 5563.759999999999
because it was like yeah the collapse of

5562.0 --> 5566.4
a nation that's technically

5563.76 --> 5567.12
built on pride that's terrible it's

5566.4 --> 5570.159
terrible for

5567.12 --> 5575.84
those people too so everybody was just

5570.159 --> 5575.839999999999
wanting to forget about it

5586.84 --> 5589.84
what

5605.679 --> 5609.6
no mark germany did lose they

5608.719 --> 5613.36
surrendered

5609.6 --> 5617.84
it's all official eventually surrendered

5613.36 --> 5617.839999999999
they did lose and there was war

5617.92 --> 5620.88
there was a war

5621.52 --> 5627.1990000000005
you know remember also america fire

5625.44 --> 5629.12
bombed

5627.199 --> 5630.48
the [ __ ] out of a big couple of big

5629.12 --> 5633.84
cities

5630.48 --> 5637.839999999999
yeah yeah that happened

5633.84 --> 5637.84
definitely was a war

5638.159 --> 5645.839999999999
there's no it wasn't all fake

5641.679 --> 5645.84
absolutely not

5669.28 --> 5673.44
yeah well what if no it's not they've

5672.639 --> 5676.96
they fought

5673.44 --> 5681.199
and they lost there was no other

5676.96 --> 5684.2390000000005
thing except for maybe some sneaky

5681.199 --> 5686.4
at the top deals as i mentioned

5684.239 --> 5688.48
now that would have been more likely to

5686.4 --> 5692.719
have happened

5688.48 --> 5696.638999999999
but on the ground level no like

5692.719 --> 5698.8
they were never going to you know

5696.639 --> 5700.0
the whole thing was built on pride too

5698.8 --> 5703.92
like as soon as

5700.0 --> 5715.84
they would just do something else then

5703.92 --> 5715.84
every the whole thing would break apart

5747.119 --> 5750.239
it's not bad to ponder it but yeah you

5749.52 --> 5752.320000000001
gotta

5750.239 --> 5754.08
keep it real though you know there is

5752.32 --> 5754.799999999999
there's a lot of things that were left

5754.08 --> 5757.92
out

5754.8 --> 5758.8
now you gotta see it like that when

5757.92 --> 5763.4400000000005
history

5758.8 --> 5767.360000000001
is altered it's mostly a red herring

5763.44 --> 5770.4
that means that they keep things out

5767.36 --> 5774.08
because this very rare that they really

5770.4 --> 5776.799999999999
make up something from scratch because

5774.08 --> 5777.6
of the implications those it will be

5776.8 --> 5780.400000000001
figured out

5777.6 --> 5782.08
it's like an inevitable historically it

5780.4 --> 5783.36
will eventually be figured out to be

5782.08 --> 5786.88
fake

5783.36 --> 5789.599999999999
it's or you need entire apparatus

5786.88 --> 5790.08
constantly convincing everybody it's

5789.6 --> 5794.14
real

5790.08 --> 5796.84
then then it'll become like a historical

5794.14 --> 5799.84
[Music]

5796.84 --> 5799.84
religion

5803.6 --> 5807.360000000001
but yeah there's a lot of things that i

5806.48 --> 5809.919999999999
can think of

5807.36 --> 5811.44
a lot of the time that that could happen

5809.92 --> 5813.52
in between

5811.44 --> 5815.119
in between it all you know that's

5813.52 --> 5817.119000000001
something i typically do and it is

5815.119 --> 5819.44
something that i guess

5817.119 --> 5820.639
story writers and movie makers also tend

5819.44 --> 5823.759999999999
to do

5820.639 --> 5825.679
but then they completely make it about a

5823.76 --> 5827.679
theme or whatever

5825.679 --> 5829.1990000000005
but i constantly just bring up these

5827.679 --> 5832.2390000000005
ideas like okay

5829.199 --> 5835.36
this happened i'm going to assume

5832.239 --> 5837.919999999999
there is a lot of things left out on

5835.36 --> 5841.679
purpose because probably bad situation

5837.92 --> 5843.28
shame situation or

5841.679 --> 5845.119
something that is still in the works

5843.28 --> 5846.8
that i already knew about worked on and

5845.119 --> 5847.599999999999
we are even not supposed to know right

5846.8 --> 5849.76
now

5847.6 --> 5851.4400000000005
you know like that and then just figure

5849.76 --> 5852.320000000001
out okay how are the people that are

5851.44 --> 5855.119
doing that

5852.32 --> 5857.119
going to go about so for me it's really

5855.119 --> 5859.28
like role-playing trying to get into

5857.119 --> 5861.759999999999
their shoes

5859.28 --> 5863.36
be them and then figure out what is like

5861.76 --> 5868.08
reenacting what is happening

5863.36 --> 5870.88
what is likely done in between

5868.08 --> 5872.08
does it fit does it make logical sense

5870.88 --> 5874.88
and then suddenly

5872.08 --> 5875.199
you have instead of a wild idea that

5874.88 --> 5878.2390000000005
just

5875.199 --> 5880.32
throws [ __ ] around you have really a

5878.239 --> 5883.36
concise little idea that just

5880.32 --> 5884.239
fits in there like a big jewel in a

5883.36 --> 5887.199
crown

5884.239 --> 5889.04
it just fits that's that's what i hope

5887.199 --> 5890.159
to aim for every time because those are

5889.04 --> 5892.8
the best ideas

5890.159 --> 5893.28
when you suddenly like see that which

5892.8 --> 5896.719
was

5893.28 --> 5899.84
rendered invisible just see it again

5896.719 --> 5901.76
see that what has to be there

5899.84 --> 5904.0
now that's something that i find very

5901.76 --> 5907.280000000001
interesting to do

5904.0 --> 5909.679
and it is pure intuition and

5907.28 --> 5911.28
knowledge about people and what is real

5909.679 --> 5914.56
and how people are fooled

5911.28 --> 5918.239
how unbelievable

5914.56 --> 5922.84
unbelievably reliable

5918.239 --> 5925.44
foolery is how deeply

5922.84 --> 5930.88
everything all powers

5925.44 --> 5933.919999999999
tend to lean on how reliable

5930.88 --> 5939.4400000000005
how rel unreliable people can be fooled

5933.92 --> 5942.88
how reliable that effect is

5939.44 --> 5953.839999999999
it's like a pillar of government is just

5942.88 --> 5953.84
that people can be full

5962.32 --> 5966.96
two people watching yeah it makes no

5966.56 --> 5969.6
sense

5966.96 --> 5970.96
the votes i told you i told you it's all

5969.6 --> 5973.84
rigged

5970.96 --> 5975.119
the entire vote system is completely

5973.84 --> 5977.679
rigged with me

5975.119 --> 5978.4
it doesn't make any damn sense it's

5977.679 --> 5982.719
usually

5978.4 --> 5986.08
50 50 or

5982.719 --> 5988.159
30 70 oh

5986.08 --> 5990.159
more down it's very rare to find a video

5988.159 --> 5994.879999999999
that has more uploads

5990.159 --> 5996.719
very rare on my channel

5994.88 --> 5998.08
but there's no logical consistency with

5996.719 --> 5999.92
the amount of people watching

5998.08 --> 6001.36
and then the vote distribution there's

5999.92 --> 6005.119
just no logic it's

6001.36 --> 6007.839999999999
so artificial it's like a bot

6005.119 --> 6010.0
is governing my statistics in what i'm

6007.84 --> 6011.679
supposed to be displaying according to

6010.0 --> 6014.0
the system because they don't want

6011.679 --> 6017.84
anything natural shining through

6014.0 --> 6018.4
they don't want it i'm too natural so

6017.84 --> 6021.360000000001
they want

6018.4 --> 6022.96
everything that they can do to be purely

6021.36 --> 6026.239
artificial

6022.96 --> 6027.04
in order to kind of disconnect it try to

6026.239 --> 6029.44
break

6027.04 --> 6030.8
my flow in what i'm doing that's really

6029.44 --> 6033.839999999999
it

6030.8 --> 6036.88
it's it's high

6033.84 --> 6041.679
tier top down trolling

6036.88 --> 6041.679
from within the company pretty sure

6041.92 --> 6046.4
whether that has a financial objective

6044.4 --> 6049.5199999999995
political objective

6046.4 --> 6052.638999999999
or whatever doesn't really matter to me

6049.52 --> 6053.679
it's just blatantly obvious that that

6052.639 --> 6056.32
the votings

6053.679 --> 6056.8
the voting in my show is constantly

6056.32 --> 6060.719
being

6056.8 --> 6063.04
rigged really really rigged

6060.719 --> 6065.44
it's unnatural it's illogical it's not

6063.04 --> 6068.48
human it's not human driven

6065.44 --> 6070.719
the information is not displaying any

6068.48 --> 6073.199
kind of logical consistency with how

6070.719 --> 6079.84
things really work

6073.199 --> 6079.839999999999
in social media

6080.48 --> 6086.638999999999
but yeah maybe it's a a pay to win

6083.84 --> 6087.52
kind of situation they just maybe

6086.639 --> 6090.719
they're

6087.52 --> 6092.719
they literally don't give a [ __ ]

6090.719 --> 6094.32
anymore about the content even they just

6092.719 --> 6098.159
want you to get

6094.32 --> 6100.0
they want you to get caught up in

6098.159 --> 6103.599999999999
i want more i want more i want to be

6100.0 --> 6106.4
more popular i want more money

6103.6 --> 6106.88
and that's why they make it so easy for

6106.4 --> 6112.0
you to

6106.88 --> 6115.28
buy subscribers and viewers and

6112.0 --> 6116.48
prime content commenters like real

6115.28 --> 6119.04
comment writers you can

6116.48 --> 6122.239
yeah get constant advertising [ __ ] about

6119.04 --> 6124.48
this and i'm never gonna do that

6122.239 --> 6126.879999999999
that's what they want they just want you

6124.48 --> 6128.0
to give them more money in some way and

6126.88 --> 6132.159000000001
then

6128.0 --> 6136.08
turn you into a yeah a money

6132.159 --> 6138.638999999999
a money hog so you're just like that

6136.08 --> 6140.5599999999995
and then you can enhance that and echo

6138.639 --> 6143.6
that on to more people that

6140.56 --> 6146.2390000000005
also turn into money hogs i think that's

6143.6 --> 6146.2390000000005
what they want

6147.52 --> 6150.639
just all want to turn everybody into

6149.679 --> 6163.84
automated

6150.639 --> 6163.84
money obsessed demons

6166.639 --> 6170.0
yeah thank you mark why if i let the

6168.32 --> 6172.4
haters get to me then i would

6170.0 --> 6173.52
just constantly be doing that because

6172.4 --> 6177.36
they try

6173.52 --> 6180.8
from all directions that yeah comments

6177.36 --> 6184.0
trolls in chat in other places i come

6180.8 --> 6187.28
people in other hangouts

6184.0 --> 6188.639
like even yeah if i show myself in chat

6187.28 --> 6190.32
somewhere in its life

6188.639 --> 6191.679
then they'll just take it upon them to

6190.32 --> 6194.08
start blabbering and

6191.679 --> 6194.88
shaming me when i'm just popping in chat

6194.08 --> 6198.96
so

6194.88 --> 6201.1990000000005
it's everywhere and it is getting to me

6198.96 --> 6202.0
but i can't let it really get to me

6201.199 --> 6205.36
because then

6202.0 --> 6208.639
there's nothing left

6205.36 --> 6210.88
but it's you know

6208.639 --> 6211.76
the only thing is do is basically build

6210.88 --> 6219.28
a

6211.76 --> 6221.84
very deep seed of revenge

6219.28 --> 6224.159
and yeah i'm gonna make it very specific

6221.84 --> 6226.400000000001
you know i'm not gonna

6224.159 --> 6227.5199999999995
throw that revenge on somebody else no

6226.4 --> 6229.759999999999
no no

6227.52 --> 6231.4400000000005
i bet there will be a time when i will

6229.76 --> 6234.639
be able to just

6231.44 --> 6235.28
track every single piece of [ __ ] down no

6234.639 --> 6237.679
matter how

6235.28 --> 6239.599999999999
anonymous they thought they were and

6237.679 --> 6246.08
i'll be able to do something about it

6239.6 --> 6248.56
who knows might take a long time

6246.08 --> 6249.84
yeah this idea that you can just

6248.56 --> 6252.96
anonymously

6249.84 --> 6254.8
cause havoc like that and

6252.96 --> 6256.08
like having fun is something else you

6254.8 --> 6258.159000000001
know

6256.08 --> 6260.0
being having meme wars and [ __ ] but

6258.159 --> 6263.28
there's a place for that but literally

6260.0 --> 6265.76
harassment and just

6263.28 --> 6267.199
pure attempts at bullying and

6265.76 --> 6270.2390000000005
gaslighting that's

6267.199 --> 6275.839999999999
it's evil it's evil and it's

6270.239 --> 6275.839999999999
cannot be tolerated

6275.92 --> 6282.88
then it should never ever ever

6279.44 --> 6283.678999999999
be politicized which it has been and now

6282.88 --> 6285.36
bullying

6283.679 --> 6288.4
is something completely different now

6285.36 --> 6292.48
bullying is using the wrong pronoun

6288.4 --> 6294.96
which is the most useless [ __ ] ever

6292.48 --> 6296.638999999999
they literally rendered it useless they

6294.96 --> 6300.2390000000005
rendered

6296.639 --> 6303.84
counter bullying useless by making it

6300.239 --> 6306.4
just about nonsense

6303.84 --> 6308.56
and now everybody hates people that do

6306.4 --> 6308.5599999999995
that

6311.04 --> 6317.84
or you're a slave to it

6320.0 --> 6331.84
i have people that really don't like

6321.76 --> 6331.84
themselves yeah

6335.28 --> 6339.44
but then again i do have people that do

6337.52 --> 6341.280000000001
like and respect themselves

6339.44 --> 6343.678999999999
as well and they hang around my chat a

6341.28 --> 6345.84
lot and they sponsor me

6343.679 --> 6345.84
so

6356.4 --> 6363.36
anyway i'm gonna round out the show i uh

6359.92 --> 6366.8
went to another 10 minutes extra but

6363.36 --> 6366.799999999999
