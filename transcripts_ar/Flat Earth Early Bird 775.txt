quickly like yesterday

or was it the day before so it's just

106.32 --> 110.079
beautiful bright

110.399 --> 115.84
sun in the blue sky

118.399 --> 121.2

ah it's still way too hot hmm

171.599 --> 174.39999999999998
hello zach

176.72 --> 180.879
you really enjoy my program okay

181.599 --> 199.83999999999997
glad to hear it i think

184.959 --> 199.84
i'm doing pretty well the last few days

210.84 --> 216.879
right

213.04 --> 220.239
right so as for what i did yesterday

216.879 --> 222.159
early bird flat earth debate uh

220.239 --> 224.4
yeah was very crowded over the flat

222.159 --> 227.04
earth debate so people were definitely

224.4 --> 229.28
lining up

227.04 --> 230.959
and yeah the google panel there was like

229.28 --> 234.319
10 people there or something

230.959 --> 241.439
it's incredibly full so

234.319 --> 244.64
it's about time

241.439 --> 247.12
and yeah i i don't think i was very

244.64 --> 251.35999999999999
active in there

247.12 --> 253.36
i just let the rest do their thing

251.36 --> 255.84
because i had a pretty good show i think

253.36 --> 255.84
and

256.239 --> 262.96
it was just good sitting there and

259.68 --> 265.04
contributed a little here and there

262.96 --> 266.23999999999995
but then went out for groceries when i

265.04 --> 268.32
came back the show was

266.24 --> 270.88
over already like including the after

268.32 --> 270.88
show so

272.16 --> 276.8
it was good to see everybody getting all

274.0 --> 276.8
active again

277.6 --> 284.56
uh there was no

280.72 --> 288.40000000000003
owen benjamin that i could spot

284.56 --> 290.0
going live and i watched some infowars

288.4 --> 293.12
instead to just see

290.0 --> 293.12
like what was going on

294.84 --> 297.84
and

301.039 --> 304.56
uh did i even talk about this before uh

303.759 --> 306.47900000000004
it's like

304.56 --> 309.039
david knight somebody well i mentioned

306.479 --> 312.24
him on my show regularly

309.039 --> 314.24
because i did appreciate his his

312.24 --> 316.32
program the david knight show that was

314.24 --> 320.40000000000003
usually earlier than

316.32 --> 325.84
the infowars show and apparently he was

320.4 --> 325.84
kicked out last month somewhere

326.72 --> 332.32000000000005
and yeah i just took notice of that

330.32 --> 334.4
somewhere yesterday or the day before

332.32 --> 335.36
and it was disappointing because i

334.4 --> 338.479
really liked

335.36 --> 340.96000000000004
the guy and what you had to say and alex

338.479 --> 343.36
jones was just

340.96 --> 345.35999999999996
responding to it yesterday and getting

343.36 --> 348.8
all pissed off

345.36 --> 352.8
and i don't know was confusing and

348.8 --> 355.28000000000003
probably embarrassing

352.8 --> 355.84000000000003
basically declared that like david

355.28 --> 359.19899999999996
knight's

355.84 --> 363.28
son was all anti

359.199 --> 365.36
alex jones in some ways and

363.28 --> 367.84
i don't know the details so yeah i was

365.36 --> 367.84000000000003
basically

368.16 --> 371.91900000000004
left to my devices to interpret and i

371.039 --> 375.199
don't really

371.919 --> 378.84
trust alex jones when he gets like that

375.199 --> 381.84000000000003
so he was basically just squirting over

378.84 --> 381.84
it

382.16 --> 386.24
and but yeah i don't know i don't i

385.28 --> 388.96
haven't really looked

386.24 --> 391.759
into david knight's son and the other

388.96 --> 391.75899999999996
website and

392.16 --> 396.40000000000003
but there's a whole bunch of people now

394.88 --> 399.919
over the years that have been

396.4 --> 403.59999999999997
kind of kicked out of infowars for

399.919 --> 403.59999999999997
well similar situations

405.6 --> 411.84000000000003
just a whole bunch of people now

409.759 --> 413.599
like the last one was millie weaver

411.84 --> 414.56
something like that happened to her as

413.599 --> 418.88
well

414.56 --> 418.88
again because of some family member

421.599 --> 426.319
that just was like making them break

424.24 --> 429.759
with the program or something

426.319 --> 429.759
it's it's weird

429.84 --> 433.919
that's why i try not to get too caught

431.84 --> 437.84
up into it

433.919 --> 437.84
like not to care that much

438.16 --> 443.84000000000003
but it's just it makes it everything

440.56 --> 443.84
very messy over there

444.8 --> 448.96000000000004
and that's why i usually don't really

446.8 --> 449.759
follow infowars that much anymore but

448.96 --> 452.479
with the recent

449.759 --> 455.12
events i just want want to see what

452.479 --> 457.28
they're doing with that

455.12 --> 458.319
how they're responding to the the weird

457.28 --> 461.11999999999995
flip around

458.319 --> 463.44
in attitude in a lot of ways and new

461.12 --> 467.199
accusations because apparently now

463.44 --> 470.96
infowars is and trump are made to blame

467.199 --> 474.0
and like are they really to blame

470.96 --> 479.84
not really but in

474.0 --> 479.84
ways it's it's giant mess

481.599 --> 485.84
it's very hard for me to tell really

483.759 --> 487.36
what is really happening now it's just a

485.84 --> 493.84
lot of

487.36 --> 493.84000000000003
complicated virtual play to me

499.68 --> 507.84000000000003
hey yado and

502.879 --> 507.84000000000003
hannah koella good to see you

516.409 --> 519.609
[Music]

538.959 --> 542.3199999999999
right other than that uh

543.519 --> 550.9590000000001
didn't really do that much just

547.12 --> 554.08
check out some some shows

550.959 --> 554.0799999999999
but not really

554.24 --> 561.44
extremely interesting ones or just

557.44 --> 561.44
it wasn't yesterday it was monday right

575.68 --> 580.88
and i went to bed even earlier than i

578.32 --> 583.6
did yesterday

580.88 --> 584.0
so maybe that's why i'm on time now

583.6 --> 591.839
although

584.0 --> 591.839
i still just got up at 12.

602.8 --> 606.959
yeah hello by the way steamy traveler

604.56 --> 608.7199999999999
did i say hello

606.959 --> 611.1199999999999
some news in the netherlands portraying

608.72 --> 615.519
the evil gods

611.12 --> 619.839
i haven't actually even checked it out

615.519 --> 619.839
maybe i should it's just that

620.72 --> 624.1600000000001
i'm i'm kind of sick of the situation

623.279 --> 628.24
like

624.16 --> 631.4399999999999
the convolution of it i already kind of

628.24 --> 634.88
cast my predictions but i just

631.44 --> 637.0400000000001
i'm not looking forward or

634.88 --> 638.24
just looking out to just see how

637.04 --> 640.64
everything just

638.24 --> 643.04
starts to spout out its corruption and

640.64 --> 643.04
all that

643.279 --> 647.279
i think that it's very unpleasant thing

646.0 --> 650.0
to watch

647.279 --> 650.64
so i'm not i haven't been really eager

650.0 --> 652.959
to see

650.64 --> 654.56
like oh this is now how the dutch news

652.959 --> 657.1999999999999
is going to respond again

654.56 --> 659.5999999999999
probably very similar to the times from

657.2 --> 661.76
obama

659.6 --> 664.16
they'll have that same manic type of

661.76 --> 664.16
vibe

665.44 --> 668.399
it's ugh

670.0 --> 689.8389999999999
very unpleasant

675.44 --> 689.839
but maybe i should check it out

692.399 --> 698.399
but from the other superficials there is

696.0 --> 700.16
a lot of people spin doctoring about it

698.399 --> 703.92
too

700.16 --> 707.1999999999999
from the liberals over here

703.92 --> 710.959
it's just it's easy to recognize

707.2 --> 710.9590000000001
so that's happening everywhere

711.279 --> 716.0
in the regular dutch television i have

714.16 --> 718.56
no doubt of it even though i haven't

716.0 --> 719.44
actually watched it it's just they do

718.56 --> 722.6389999999999
that [ __ ]

719.44 --> 722.639
so i already know

726.32 --> 731.839
i would like to forget that they do that

739.519 --> 745.839
hello rubbish

770.839 --> 776.83
so

773.71 --> 776.83
[Music]

784.839 --> 787.839
so

793.279 --> 801.8389999999999
right anyway yeah that's that's pretty

795.76 --> 801.8389999999999
much it

803.839 --> 808.48
yeah for what i did yesterday and ah i

806.32 --> 810.88
don't know maybe it's the light

808.48 --> 812.0
i'm just like oh flights so i'm kind of

810.88 --> 814.0
slowing down

812.0 --> 817.2
like a plant just absorbing this light

814.0 --> 820.639
from all directions because it is like

817.2 --> 821.6800000000001
reflecting off the wall and kind of

820.639 --> 828.8
lightening up the

821.68 --> 832.7199999999999
lighting up the entire room

828.8 --> 832.7199999999999
and i always appreciate

832.88 --> 838.959
open clear sunlight during the winters

837.04 --> 843.8389999999999
it has been kind of shadowy in the last

838.959 --> 843.8389999999999
few days

850.56 --> 855.199
gonna be a few interesting interesting

853.839 --> 858.399
few days on the plane

855.199 --> 861.04
well for sure just

858.399 --> 861.04
or rather

862.24 --> 869.839
like how it's gonna end up is gonna be

865.36 --> 885.839
pretty heavy stuff

869.839 --> 885.839
either way

894.48 --> 901.1990000000001
and even though i don't know i have

897.839 --> 905.12
in my own way a i trust the plan

901.199 --> 907.8389999999999
based on things that i've heard and seen

905.12 --> 907.839
and even

908.88 --> 915.92
through visions and stuff just putting

912.88 --> 918.56
overall almost like

915.92 --> 920.0
experienced tapes from my memory

918.56 --> 922.3199999999999
together

920.0 --> 924.639
that's not it doesn't seem to be like

922.32 --> 925.519
the la like it's just these four years

924.639 --> 929.12
for trump

925.519 --> 930.48
in my memory but then again maybe that's

929.12 --> 933.44
false

930.48 --> 935.36
maybe that's a false memory maybe that's

933.44 --> 937.36
i don't know how that works

935.36 --> 940.0
it's like eventually it doesn't really

937.36 --> 943.1990000000001
matter what i've seen it's only like

940.0 --> 945.6
am i going to just say

943.199 --> 947.199
it's going to be a certain way and then

945.6 --> 950.8000000000001
just try to make it

947.199 --> 950.8
like that or

951.839 --> 954.8800000000001
try to draw conclusions and then stick

954.399 --> 958.16
to that

954.88 --> 961.36
even though even my feelings really push

958.16 --> 961.36
me in other directions

965.6 --> 970.16
all right my wife can listen to me not

968.16 --> 972.88
to nathan

970.16 --> 976.48
well it's a whole different it's a whole

972.88 --> 976.48
different scenario now isn't it

980.0 --> 985.839
so where nathan is at with the ballers

982.24 --> 985.839
and all that that's pretty much uh

986.0 --> 990.8
a brawl situation my hangout over here

989.44 --> 997.839
is nothing

990.8 --> 997.8389999999999
even close to that

1000.24 --> 1007.6
it's just me it's more like a

1003.44 --> 1010.399
i guess like a private tutor situation

1007.6 --> 1012.16
sort of even though i don't have a

1010.399 --> 1015.36
standard program

1012.16 --> 1018.56
this is but i do have objectives and i

1015.36 --> 1018.5600000000001
do have methods and

1019.6 --> 1022.0790000000001
all that

1023.36 --> 1030.48
i do have things to present so

1027.12 --> 1031.1989999999998
i guess that a lot of people can listen

1030.48 --> 1035.76
to that

1031.199 --> 1037.679
and just the brawl situation

1035.76 --> 1039.679
yeah the brawl situations that tend to

1037.679 --> 1043.1200000000001
happen over at nathan's especially when

1039.679 --> 1045.3600000000001
ballers get in and get all balderish

1043.12 --> 1047.6
yeah that's a lot of people probably

1045.36 --> 1052.24
won't like that

1047.6 --> 1054.799
i however am very amused by that

1052.24 --> 1054.799
it's like

1055.36 --> 1061.36
in a way our knowledge is like a weapon

1058.72 --> 1061.84
and yeah we try to polish it and all

1061.36 --> 1064.32
that

1061.84 --> 1066.9599999999998
and we talk about it but to see it

1064.32 --> 1071.28
actually in action life

1066.96 --> 1071.28
gives a whole another dimension to it

1074.08 --> 1078.48
yeah when you see it being tested you

1075.919 --> 1081.2800000000002
see how good it really is

1078.48 --> 1082.72
how much of an impact it makes on on the

1081.28 --> 1086.24
other party

1082.72 --> 1090.24
see and and that is kind of like

1086.24 --> 1090.24
something extra that i get out of it

1091.12 --> 1097.6
and it can be just very funny

1095.52 --> 1099.6
and yeah if you don't have that if you

1097.6 --> 1103.1999999999998
don't get that from it if you're not

1099.6 --> 1106.6399999999999
yourself uh an active

1103.2 --> 1109.44
dedicated debater or in nature like that

1106.64 --> 1111.2800000000002
that you decide you do that then

1109.44 --> 1111.679
probably the flat earth debates will

1111.28 --> 1114.3999999999999
have

1111.679 --> 1116.24
less of an appeal to you in the heated

1114.4 --> 1118.72
up moments

1116.24 --> 1120.799
it'll just be like just guys screaming

1118.72 --> 1123.52
at it

1120.799 --> 1125.679
to you but there's actually a lot of

1123.52 --> 1128.24
detailed things going on

1125.679 --> 1130.96
and like even very subtle psychological

1128.24 --> 1134.32
warfare and the unraveling thereof

1130.96 --> 1137.1200000000001
it's happening a lot so

1134.32 --> 1139.28
but you can i guess only really

1137.12 --> 1142.0
appreciate that

1139.28 --> 1143.84
if you're willing to go there and not

1142.0 --> 1146.0
get all stressed out from it

1143.84 --> 1148.32
you know because a lot of people it's

1146.0 --> 1150.32
just too too compact too heavy too

1148.32 --> 1151.039
triggering even though they don't have

1150.32 --> 1154.08
any

1151.039 --> 1156.0
specific investment into the argument

1154.08 --> 1159.6789999999999
from either side

1156.0 --> 1162.32
the tenseness of it may rub off wrong on

1159.679 --> 1164.88
you and then yeah you don't like it

1162.32 --> 1165.36
maybe another time things will be

1164.88 --> 1167.44
different

1165.36 --> 1169.6789999999999
and then you would like it surprisingly

1167.44 --> 1171.919
you wouldn't even expect it

1169.679 --> 1171.919
right

1175.84 --> 1179.84
right yeah rob h totally correct

1196.24 --> 1199.039
yes rob h

1200.72 --> 1204.0
yeah you're totally right like nathan

1203.2 --> 1207.1200000000001
does that

1204.0 --> 1209.28
because the people that he faces

1207.12 --> 1211.9189999999999
deserve that he never just starts out

1209.28 --> 1214.0
like that it's always

1211.919 --> 1215.039
first the ballers have to prove how

1214.0 --> 1218.96
stupid they are

1215.039 --> 1223.039
and how devious they are before he

1218.96 --> 1226.799
transforms to that mode

1223.039 --> 1229.12
modus apparently the way to do that

1226.799 --> 1231.2
and he's very very consistent and

1229.12 --> 1233.52
careful with it and he's also

1231.2 --> 1235.1200000000001
made just a couple handful of mistakes

1233.52 --> 1237.039
over the years

1235.12 --> 1238.9599999999998
sizing it up differently and then

1237.039 --> 1240.0
retracting when he figured out like oh

1238.96 --> 1242.96
wait it wasn't

1240.0 --> 1245.44
that at all oops and i myself have done

1242.96 --> 1245.44
that too

1245.76 --> 1249.6
with chat and then it's even easier with

1248.64 --> 1251.76
chat to

1249.6 --> 1253.76
to make mistake somebody that's actually

1251.76 --> 1254.32
just asking a newbie question for a

1253.76 --> 1256.4
troll

1254.32 --> 1257.52
acting like they're a newbie asking a

1256.4 --> 1260.88
question to annoy you

1257.52 --> 1263.9189999999999
you see it's much easier when

1260.88 --> 1265.44
to fall to make a wrong standard

1263.919 --> 1267.3600000000001
approach assumption

1265.44 --> 1269.2
with somebody in chat but i have gotten

1267.36 --> 1269.76
a lot better at it because i've trained

1269.2 --> 1276.51
that

1269.76 --> 1279.36
specifically with this show

1276.51 --> 1281.44
[Music]

1279.36 --> 1283.28
but right but just because it is all

1281.44 --> 1284.72
justified and there's something to

1283.28 --> 1286.6399999999999
attain from it doesn't mean that

1284.72 --> 1287.919
everybody's going to like it because you

1286.64 --> 1305.8400000000001
have to be

1287.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
into that to get it and appreciate it

1307.76 --> 1318.24
what he needs to get over his

1312.72 --> 1320.799
entropy formula and describe what

1318.24 --> 1320.799
what do you mean

1327.36 --> 1347.84
hello miss crazy eighty

1330.72 --> 1347.84
and at tail

1349.6 --> 1354.08
it's just a weird statement like what do

1351.76 --> 1357.44
you mean he needs to get over his

1354.08 --> 1360.0
intro tropy

1357.44 --> 1362.0800000000002
formula and this what do you mean he

1360.0 --> 1365.2
needs to get over it

1362.08 --> 1367.4399999999998
it's true entropy

1365.2 --> 1369.679
it can be just used as a basic

1367.44 --> 1374.159
description it's a one-way direction

1369.679 --> 1376.799
effect that's universally present

1374.159 --> 1379.2800000000002
and it doesn't need to be reduced to

1376.799 --> 1382.08
extreme specifics

1379.28 --> 1383.72
that that's the glory of it it's so big

1382.08 --> 1387.4399999999998
and all encompassing

1383.72 --> 1388.08
influential on basics of reality that

1387.44 --> 1391.76
it's very

1388.08 --> 1394.8799999999999
easy to just draw it in as an argument

1391.76 --> 1398.96
and in academic circles that

1394.88 --> 1402.96
sort of thing has been done a lot

1398.96 --> 1404.799
it's like a normal thing to do

1402.96 --> 1406.559
and i figured that one out even way

1404.799 --> 1407.44
before i understood it and now i'm

1406.559 --> 1411.84
talking about

1407.44 --> 1414.24
decades ago seeing other people discuss

1411.84 --> 1416.3999999999999
about physics

1414.24 --> 1418.559
entropy is really a common thing to

1416.4 --> 1420.72
bring up

1418.559 --> 1422.48
because it yeah because it happens

1420.72 --> 1424.72
always is

1422.48 --> 1426.72
that's why when you're trying to figure

1424.72 --> 1429.279
out

1426.72 --> 1430.32
something you have to deal with the

1429.279 --> 1433.44
things that happen

1430.32 --> 1434.3999999999999
always in order to understand how to get

1433.44 --> 1436.64
there you see

1434.4 --> 1438.159
so entropy is a really common thing to

1436.64 --> 1441.3600000000001
bring up

1438.159 --> 1443.44
in the study of physics and i knew that

1441.36 --> 1445.84
even before i completely understood what

1443.44 --> 1449.2
entropy was

1445.84 --> 1451.039
when i was younger still pay attention

1449.2 --> 1451.52
to like even if i don't understand

1451.039 --> 1454.96
something

1451.52 --> 1455.76
how much it is brought up and how much

1454.96 --> 1457.76
feelings

1455.76 --> 1459.6
get invested and feelings only get

1457.76 --> 1463.6
invested when it's worth it

1459.6 --> 1464.48
to the person and the person that knows

1463.6 --> 1468.559
what it means

1464.48 --> 1472.559
often yeah will

1468.559 --> 1473.6
will not just they will try to utilize

1472.559 --> 1476.48
it

1473.6 --> 1478.0
as with as much effect as they can see

1476.48 --> 1481.279
they can get out of it so that's

1478.0 --> 1483.679
yeah this is it's almost like

1481.279 --> 1485.52
yeah data harvesting about something you

1483.679 --> 1486.64
don't understand but i did that when i

1485.52 --> 1488.08
was young a lot

1486.64 --> 1490.0800000000002
because there was a whole bunch of

1488.08 --> 1492.72
things about what other people did that

1490.08 --> 1492.72
i didn't get

1493.6 --> 1500.3999999999999
so i did that to figure out just like

1497.12 --> 1502.4799999999998
go systematic like if you don't

1500.4 --> 1503.039
understand something then assume that at

1502.48 --> 1505.279
some point

1503.039 --> 1506.4
point you will understand it and you

1505.279 --> 1509.919
just try to back

1506.4 --> 1512.72
engineer through structure and

1509.919 --> 1514.0
just being confronted with the use of it

1512.72 --> 1516.32
to try and figure out what

1514.0 --> 1516.32
it is

1517.279 --> 1522.32
and that was before internet time by the

1520.08 --> 1522.32
way

1523.039 --> 1530.4
right hey seeking star wars

1526.799 --> 1530.96
good to see you nathan a steamy traveler

1530.4 --> 1535.039
nathan

1530.96 --> 1538.159
is mind numbing repetition with yelling

1535.039 --> 1538.799
like children i win this interesting and

1538.159 --> 1541.1200000000001
varied

1538.799 --> 1543.36
discussions never boring except bathroom

1541.12 --> 1549.279
weights

1543.36 --> 1549.279
okay no i completely disagree

1549.919 --> 1553.039
no nathan is

1553.12 --> 1560.0
necessary mind-numbing repetition

1557.2 --> 1562.159
and yeah when there is childlike

1560.0 --> 1564.4
behavior involved there will be yelling

1562.159 --> 1565.8400000000001
like children that's gonna happen and

1564.4 --> 1567.52
then there's going to be the counter

1565.84 --> 1570.9599999999998
response

1567.52 --> 1573.039
to try and get through to them right

1570.96 --> 1575.6000000000001
that's just the natural consequence of

1573.039 --> 1578.08
dealing with baller zealots

1575.6 --> 1579.52
and me interesting and varied

1578.08 --> 1582.8799999999999
discussions

1579.52 --> 1586.4
never boring no now that's

1582.88 --> 1588.4
i just disagree well maybe it's not

1586.4 --> 1590.4
nev it's never boring i don't know i

1588.4 --> 1592.64
just

1590.4 --> 1594.24
it's so weird when i watch it back i am

1592.64 --> 1596.72
amused

1594.24 --> 1598.08
but usually never captivated enough to

1596.72 --> 1599.84
watch through the whole thing

1598.08 --> 1602.72
to really be bound by watching it but

1599.84 --> 1606.08
i'm still think it's amusing

1602.72 --> 1609.6000000000001
but when i do it

1606.08 --> 1612.32
afterward i feel every second that i

1609.6 --> 1613.4399999999998
wasn't super active and then i think

1612.32 --> 1615.12
it's boring

1613.44 --> 1617.2
so it's just weirding me out that you

1615.12 --> 1620.08
say that

1617.2 --> 1622.159
but yes interesting and varied

1620.08 --> 1625.6
discussions

1622.159 --> 1626.96
i like interesting things i spend a lot

1625.6 --> 1631.279
of

1626.96 --> 1634.32
like i guess like intellectual skill on

1631.279 --> 1635.679
being able to attain more of that like

1634.32 --> 1638.559
how do i spend my time

1635.679 --> 1641.8400000000001
just doing the interesting things and am

1638.559 --> 1641.84
doing it well

1641.919 --> 1647.3600000000001
with with thinking not getting stuck on

1645.76 --> 1650.32
super specifics for a

1647.36 --> 1650.32
prolonged time

1650.399 --> 1658.32
uh varied discussions

1655.679 --> 1658.96
but it's also thanks to my chat and that

1658.32 --> 1660.8799999999999
i'm not

1658.96 --> 1663.679
just talking about flat earth

1660.88 --> 1663.679
exclusively

1664.64 --> 1668.0
look it's pretty amazing that nathan

1666.96 --> 1672.0
really managed

1668.0 --> 1675.919
to keep things so flat earth it's really

1672.0 --> 1679.039
that's impressive look how many other

1675.919 --> 1681.279
flat earthers are out there

1679.039 --> 1682.1589999999999
that are actually over the years and now

1681.279 --> 1685.6
nathan has a

1682.159 --> 1687.5200000000002
daily show for crying out loud

1685.6 --> 1689.12
to keep it stuck to flat earth

1687.52 --> 1691.9189999999999
constantly that's

1689.12 --> 1692.9599999999998
enormous there is no other show that i

1691.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
know that

1692.96 --> 1697.8400000000001
does that like

1698.88 --> 1703.3600000000001
even well he does pretty much always do

1702.96 --> 1706.88
it

1703.36 --> 1709.76
it's just very rarely he does

1706.88 --> 1711.2
bring up other subjects it's it's

1709.76 --> 1713.6
extremely rare and it's

1711.2 --> 1716.0800000000002
not like when everybody's typically

1713.6 --> 1716.08
doing it

1719.44 --> 1725.44
and he also talks about cars

1722.72 --> 1726.64
that's usually when just not in the mood

1725.44 --> 1730.24
for it

1726.64 --> 1730.24
for regular subjects

1731.52 --> 1736.399
stick stuff also yeah dutch sailor i

1736.84 --> 1739.84
agree

1740.799 --> 1745.44
what young man what would happen if mark

1744.159 --> 1750.159
sargent said i am

1745.44 --> 1750.159
off home now or when what

1751.36 --> 1756.24
i don't that doesn't make any sense to

1754.08 --> 1756.24
me

1764.72 --> 1767.84
it's just

1770.88 --> 1774.72
i think you might be experiencing a bit

1773.44 --> 1777.919
of over

1774.72 --> 1781.84
active imagination there these things

1777.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
are never going to happen

1784.159 --> 1789.679
for starters i would hear mark sergeant

1787.679 --> 1792.799
in the distance i can recognize that

1789.679 --> 1794.72
voice over quite a distance

1792.799 --> 1795.9189999999999
i don't think that that guy will ever

1794.72 --> 1799.84
shut up

1795.919 --> 1799.8400000000001
as long as he's not completely alone

1802.0 --> 1809.84
so i would hear him coming mark sarge

1804.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
has a very recognizable voice

1810.559 --> 1816.6399999999999
and his voice tone carries pretty far

1814.399 --> 1823.84
doesn't have to like raise his voice to

1816.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
do that

1830.61 --> 1833.78
[Music]

1837.52 --> 1839.76
hmm

1841.36 --> 1846.08
okay seeking star wars set when i first

1844.399 --> 1847.4399999999998
started listening to nathan's show i

1846.08 --> 1850.96
would hyperventilate

1847.44 --> 1854.0
holy [ __ ] really now i smile at the

1850.96 --> 1857.1200000000001
ignorance of the glovers

1854.0 --> 1859.919
wow hyper damn

1857.12 --> 1862.7199999999998
so you really took the full blow of that

1859.919 --> 1862.72
tension did you

1862.84 --> 1865.84
that's

1866.96 --> 1871.8400000000001
you know what i guess that in the very

1870.08 --> 1872.96
start of the flat earth debate when i

1871.84 --> 1876.559
was getting involved

1872.96 --> 1878.64
i had similar issues like a lot of it

1876.559 --> 1880.48
would really hurt and i would feel

1878.64 --> 1883.6000000000001
really powerless

1880.48 --> 1885.519
like but still like very encouraged to

1883.6 --> 1889.76
continue on

1885.519 --> 1892.159
most of the time but

1889.76 --> 1894.1589999999999
yeah i'm used to it now i'm just

1892.159 --> 1906.159
completely used to it i'm immersed

1894.159 --> 1908.7990000000002
into that no problem whatsoever

1906.159 --> 1908.7990000000002
but yeah

1909.72 --> 1912.72
hyperventilating

1913.36 --> 1917.1999999999998
i've never really hyperventilated like

1915.919 --> 1919.519
that

1917.2 --> 1920.72
but i do i have seen other people

1919.519 --> 1923.519
getting yeah

1920.72 --> 1924.24
have that response where that's coming

1923.519 --> 1926.3990000000001
from

1924.24 --> 1928.559
just with me it doesn't really happen

1926.399 --> 1934.799
like that i just rather just get high

1928.559 --> 1937.36
on my own nerves and hopefully not

1934.799 --> 1937.36
paranoid

1937.76 --> 1944.08
i get very impulsive

1939.36 --> 1945.9189999999999
[Music]

1944.08 --> 1947.279
and i have to hold back on those

1945.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
impulses

1947.279 --> 1949.84
anyway

1951.6 --> 1955.76
yeah when when did you start watching

1955.919 --> 1961.1200000000001
nathan oakley shows seeking star wars

1958.799 --> 1963.9189999999999
when was that roughly

1961.12 --> 1966.32
because i remember you being in chat for

1963.919 --> 1966.3200000000002
a while

1968.48 --> 1977.84
must be at least a year more

1981.6 --> 1991.84
i think probably two years

2007.12 --> 2010.6399999999999
frustrated at stupidity

2010.96 --> 2017.519
right yeah we would all like to have

2014.159 --> 2019.8400000000001
more constructive debates wouldn't we

2017.519 --> 2022.159
but unfortunately that only really

2019.84 --> 2025.9189999999999
happens

2022.159 --> 2028.64
when new ground breaks and eventually

2025.919 --> 2029.1200000000001
like the opponents in the subjects just

2028.64 --> 2032.7990000000002
learn

2029.12 --> 2034.559
and then get set in their ways

2032.799 --> 2036.32
and then that's just a bunch of standard

2034.559 --> 2038.559
strategies

2036.32 --> 2039.84
and with the ballers that's just well

2038.559 --> 2042.08
you know

2039.84 --> 2043.6
complete scatter gunning red herring

2042.08 --> 2047.84
gaslighting nonsense

2043.6 --> 2047.84
distracting away from the questions

2048.56 --> 2052.72
like how this show ended up yesterday

2050.879 --> 2054.639
with that guy that troll in chat that

2052.72 --> 2056.879
just

2054.639 --> 2058.32
that i had been addressing for like 10

2056.879 --> 2060.159
minutes

2058.32 --> 2062.639
and he probably hadn't wasn't even

2060.159 --> 2064.2400000000002
listening so i didn't even realize i was

2062.639 --> 2066.96
talking about him and he because

2064.24 --> 2069.2799999999997
was just replying to people in chat

2066.96 --> 2072.0
trying to get them

2069.28 --> 2072.0
distracted

2073.119 --> 2077.04
that's what ballers now do that's that's

2075.679 --> 2079.2000000000003
their default

2077.04 --> 2083.119
not everybody of them can do it but

2079.2 --> 2083.1189999999997
that's what they try to do

2085.75 --> 2090.639
[Music]

2087.679 --> 2090.639
right two years ago

2096.24 --> 2104.72
flat all their life

2102.0 --> 2107.119
man like really you never thought it was

2104.72 --> 2107.1189999999997
a globe

2113.59 --> 2117.839
[Music]

2114.839 --> 2117.839
ever

2121.839 --> 2126.32
yeah though you remember me ages ago

2127.359 --> 2131.839
from when

2132.64 --> 2138.24
because i was having my own shows even

2136.16 --> 2139.5989999999997
from before the flat earth debates with

2138.24 --> 2142.8799999999997
the

2139.599 --> 2145.76
flat earth talks that i did

2142.88 --> 2147.76
like subject-oriented shows and i would

2145.76 --> 2149.8390000000004
just do it like once a week or once

2147.76 --> 2152.7200000000003
every two weeks

2149.839 --> 2152.72
sometimes more

2156.56 --> 2159.839
but it was all over the place

2162.48 --> 2166.8
sometimes yeah but at least the times

2164.72 --> 2169.839
when i actually addressed

2166.8 --> 2172.7200000000003
cosmogeny things the mechanics of it

2169.839 --> 2175.04
i'm pretty satisfied with that and like

2172.72 --> 2178.64
most of it has aged pretty well now it's

2175.04 --> 2181.839
certain details are expanded upon or

2178.64 --> 2183.68
replaced by other wording but i think i

2181.839 --> 2184.7999999999997
got most of it just right from the

2183.68 --> 2188.0
get-go

2184.8 --> 2190.4
as in not right that i know exactly how

2188.0 --> 2193.839
the realm exactly is

2190.4 --> 2193.839
but i know how it could be

2196.24 --> 2201.839
with and how how do you figure that out

2205.28 --> 2209.2000000000003
and i was doing that like when other

2207.839 --> 2212.4
people were just

2209.2 --> 2215.1189999999997
just spending their time

2212.4 --> 2216.56
on the disc and just trying to defend

2215.119 --> 2220.2400000000002
the disc from the ball

2216.56 --> 2222.24
and going at the ball with the disc

2220.24 --> 2224.4799999999996
and that was what everybody was do what

2222.24 --> 2224.7999999999997
most people at least on the front lines

2224.48 --> 2226.48
that

2224.8 --> 2228.88
had bigger channels were doing that's

2226.48 --> 2231.359
what they were doing

2228.88 --> 2233.6800000000003
and i was just being that oh arwen has

2231.359 --> 2235.5989999999997
to be special has to do with

2233.68 --> 2238.16
oh he has a better model he thinks

2235.599 --> 2239.599
whatever what do you think arwen

2238.16 --> 2241.2
what is your model well there's all

2239.599 --> 2244.56
these possibilities

2241.2 --> 2248.7999999999997
right and now after what is it

2244.56 --> 2251.04
three four years i guess that now it's

2248.8 --> 2253.3590000000004
it might slowly be sinking in that

2251.04 --> 2255.44
there's more than just the disk

2253.359 --> 2257.839
and that we don't know for certain and

2255.44 --> 2261.839
that it is even like

2257.839 --> 2263.52
a key insight to know

2261.839 --> 2265.44
that you don't know and that you

2263.52 --> 2267.68
shouldn't assume what you don't know

2265.44 --> 2269.04
and that that's part of the problem and

2267.68 --> 2271.2
that's what the

2269.04 --> 2275.04
the problem where what the other side

2271.2 --> 2278.7999999999997
the globals are completely drowning in

2275.04 --> 2278.8
that's an important discovery so

2279.68 --> 2285.7599999999998
yeah i'm just proud of doing what i did

2282.64 --> 2288.0
in a very early stage

2285.76 --> 2290.0
because then also i have the proof this

2288.0 --> 2292.56
is absolutely what i did

2290.0 --> 2294.0
i did that there was nobody else i was

2292.56 --> 2296.48
just copycatting

2294.0 --> 2298.16
that was all me i did that all came

2296.48 --> 2300.48
through me through god

2298.16 --> 2302.72
through my pineal gland and vision [ __ ]

2300.48 --> 2306.2400000000002
and paranoia too

2302.72 --> 2309.52
that was all me nobody

2306.24 --> 2309.52
i didn't copy [ __ ]

2310.72 --> 2316.56
well did maybe some things i tried to

2314.16 --> 2319.04
copy but like as for the cosmogeny

2316.56 --> 2322.32
things there was no example out there

2319.04 --> 2325.2
there really wasn't for looping systems

2322.32 --> 2325.2000000000003
and all that and

2325.28 --> 2330.96
and even with the pacman earth

2328.64 --> 2331.7599999999998
it was more about oh this is how the map

2330.96 --> 2334.079
is

2331.76 --> 2335.599
they weren't even addressing like oh

2334.079 --> 2337.76
loop

2335.599 --> 2339.2000000000003
nobody was freaking addressing it not

2337.76 --> 2341.0400000000004
really you were just

2339.2 --> 2342.96
focusing on trying to make people

2341.04 --> 2343.52
understand but not actually addressing

2342.96 --> 2346.7200000000003
the

2343.52 --> 2348.72
mechanical consequences and all that now

2346.72 --> 2352.3199999999997
that part i have been addressing

2348.72 --> 2355.4399999999996
basically trying to remodel

2352.32 --> 2357.28
or expand upon not remodel or maybe

2355.44 --> 2360.16
remodel

2357.28 --> 2360.96
the mechanics like how can things work i

2360.16 --> 2363.1189999999997
was the one

2360.96 --> 2364.4
probably for the first time that said

2363.119 --> 2368.079
yeah

2364.4 --> 2369.359
a loop in space can be considered as a

2368.079 --> 2372.5600000000004
container wall

2369.359 --> 2375.2
for gas pressure because it's pushing in

2372.56 --> 2375.2
on itself

2377.28 --> 2381.6800000000003
the body that is i'm probably one of the

2380.8 --> 2384.2400000000002
first people to

2381.68 --> 2386.48
ever say that in human history maybe

2384.24 --> 2386.4799999999996
even

2387.119 --> 2391.76
now it of course is going to depend on

2389.119 --> 2394.8
whether it actually is looping for that

2391.76 --> 2398.079
to be relevant in any kind of way

2394.8 --> 2401.44
and like who's even gonna remember

2398.079 --> 2404.4
you know i think that most of my efforts

2401.44 --> 2406.16
are just there to really help push

2404.4 --> 2408.7200000000003
forward the development

2406.16 --> 2410.24
but that after a long time it's probably

2408.72 --> 2414.0789999999997
most of it's going to be completely

2410.24 --> 2414.0789999999997
forgotten nobody will actually care

2415.28 --> 2418.4
but maybe that's just me being

2416.88 --> 2421.76
pessimistic and just

2418.4 --> 2425.839
over focusing on the entropy of

2421.76 --> 2425.8390000000004
what keeps humans busy

2431.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
face on mars confused

2445.68 --> 2451.2799999999997
atmosphere escapes his head

2448.8 --> 2453.8390000000004
god this is a good question there see a

2451.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
traveler but

2454.0 --> 2457.599
look it's mainstream science it's not

2457.28 --> 2460.1600000000003
even

2457.599 --> 2462.1600000000003
science it's just the the priesthood has

2460.16 --> 2464.0
claimed all kinds of ridiculous

2462.16 --> 2465.7599999999998
and dangerous things they claim that

2464.0 --> 2468.16
meteors pretty much come by

2465.76 --> 2470.1600000000003
weekly to potentially destroy us and

2468.16 --> 2472.0
then at the last minute oh no no no it

2470.16 --> 2475.359
didn't do it

2472.0 --> 2478.16
so atmosphere escaping yeah the

2475.359 --> 2480.319
endless amounts of doom scenarios steamy

2478.16 --> 2484.0
traveler endless amounts

2480.319 --> 2487.44
it's just we shouldn't really care

2484.0 --> 2490.72
because it's all nonsense

2487.44 --> 2494.16
it's all based on a vantage point

2490.72 --> 2496.24
of a heliocentric cosmology which is it

2494.16 --> 2499.1189999999997
it is like an instant disaster

2496.24 --> 2499.1189999999997
everything about it

2501.68 --> 2504.64
it's not possible

2505.28 --> 2509.8390000000004
and if it would be possible like

2516.72 --> 2522.9599999999996
it's it's like infinitely unlikely

2519.839 --> 2526.0
because it's not real that's just the

2522.96 --> 2526.0
final conclusion

2531.599 --> 2537.839
what's that link

2540.48 --> 2544.8
oh right that's the article hmm

2548.839 --> 2551.839
okay

2560.56 --> 2564.0
yeah this is just a giant science

2563.2 --> 2567.1189999999997
fiction

2564.0 --> 2568.88
squirting fast complete nonsense

2567.119 --> 2571.44
magnetic field of the earth the

2568.88 --> 2579.839
protection against everything and

2571.44 --> 2579.839
this is it's the worst

2580.16 --> 2593.839
this is yeah total sci-fi squirt fest

2583.359 --> 2593.839
this article

2601.359 --> 2604.48
i just i just scrolled through it and

2603.28 --> 2607.599
that just looked

2604.48 --> 2611.44
absolutely atrocious

2607.599 --> 2614.079
wow and they actually had a

2611.44 --> 2615.44
like a little title like for the next

2614.079 --> 2617.8390000000004
chapter

2615.44 --> 2619.68
like how to apply this to other planets

2617.839 --> 2623.52
so you're really not like oh god

2619.68 --> 2623.52
really really

2627.04 --> 2630.4
so they're trying to

2630.64 --> 2634.4
figure out how to apply the sci-fi

2633.119 --> 2636.48
nonsense about

2634.4 --> 2637.52
the globe earth and what's happening to

2636.48 --> 2641.28
it

2637.52 --> 2643.359
to other planets like

2641.28 --> 2645.92
well it's what they do it's typically

2643.359 --> 2645.92
what they do

2646.64 --> 2651.2
it's endless amounts of busying therapy

2658.16 --> 2666.3999999999996
oh hey matthew mitchell

2663.2 --> 2669.9199999999996
three weeks away playing ketchup

2666.4 --> 2672.319
okay input is priceless is it

2669.92 --> 2677.839
i don't know but i'm glad you appreciate

2672.319 --> 2677.839
it thanks

2691.839 --> 2695.119
yeah steamy traveler

2696.079 --> 2703.52
but yeah it's part of the the trick

2699.52 --> 2707.119
isn't it they say that 90 tons per day

2703.52 --> 2708.8
loss of the atmosphere because it's so

2707.119 --> 2713.079
small it doesn't matter

2708.8 --> 2715.6800000000003
well like a constant

2713.079 --> 2718.96
depressurization which

2715.68 --> 2722.16
yeah not that there is any

2718.96 --> 2724.079
but they just say no it's slow well even

2722.16 --> 2726.72
a slow depressurization

2724.079 --> 2729.04
is going to have like a pretty

2726.72 --> 2729.68
substantial influence on the average

2729.04 --> 2731.68
pressure

2729.68 --> 2734.48
everywhere because it quickly

2731.68 --> 2738.0
redistributes the pressure redistributes

2734.48 --> 2738.0
even in a dynamic system

2738.88 --> 2744.1600000000003
it's but yeah thankfully

2742.319 --> 2746.079
we don't have to worry about it because

2744.16 --> 2748.24
it's not happening you already know

2746.079 --> 2750.2400000000002
it's not happening because earth is a

2748.24 --> 2752.0
closed system or we wouldn't have gas

2750.24 --> 2753.2799999999997
pressure at all that it wouldn't be slow

2752.0 --> 2756.88
leaking no it would just be

2753.28 --> 2758.96
bursting instantly all of it out of

2756.88 --> 2761.52
there

2758.96 --> 2764.4
if the heliocentric conception would be

2761.52 --> 2764.4
true and it's not

2764.8 --> 2767.92
thank god it isn't

2770.88 --> 2775.839
hey adam meekin what

2776.41 --> 2779.58
[Music]

2783.68 --> 2787.44
whoa 300 wait

2788.599 --> 2796.1600000000003
3285

2791.28 --> 2800.4
billion tons of gas lost since the

2796.16 --> 2802.8799999999997
the t-rex died out yeah

2800.4 --> 2805.6800000000003
yeah how there has to be a lot of gas

2802.88 --> 2807.76
producing substances in the ground

2805.68 --> 2809.1189999999997
plants have to be working hard at it to

2807.76 --> 2811.28
constantly

2809.119 --> 2817.839
create all that gas pressure wouldn't

2811.28 --> 2817.8390000000004
you say

2836.88 --> 2842.7200000000003
uh matthew mitchell what

2840.079 --> 2844.079
i don't see the connection unless it's

2842.72 --> 2847.7599999999998
an infinite plane

2844.079 --> 2850.0
would it not pop what why do you think

2847.76 --> 2850.96
why do you think there could be infinity

2850.0 --> 2854.72
do you know the

2850.96 --> 2857.119
consequence of air

2854.72 --> 2859.4399999999996
just air pressure and infinity like

2857.119 --> 2862.559
infinite space

2859.44 --> 2865.359
and infinite air and like turbulence

2862.559 --> 2865.3590000000004
consequences

2865.92 --> 2872.4
would be crazy like infinity and air

2869.92 --> 2874.64
pressure don't go well together

2872.4 --> 2875.44
either way whether it's just infinite

2874.64 --> 2878.24
space or

2875.44 --> 2887.839
infinite filled up with gas space

2878.24 --> 2887.839
there's gonna be problems

2907.68 --> 2912.0
so yeah matthew mitchell that's it

2910.079 --> 2914.96
seemed kind of like a false dichotomy

2912.0 --> 2918.24
you presented

2914.96 --> 2920.2400000000002
i can't really say the exact fallacy

2918.24 --> 2923.2
it's just

2920.24 --> 2923.52
i don't yeah infinite plane y infinite

2923.2 --> 2926.7999999999997
no

2923.52 --> 2928.16
infinite not infinite has to be a

2926.8 --> 2932.0
limited amount of space

2928.16 --> 2932.0
in a container in a container

2932.24 --> 2936.0789999999997
but yeah if there is a looping factor to

2935.119 --> 2939.2000000000003
the container

2936.079 --> 2942.4
it's still possible because

2939.2 --> 2945.1189999999997
this yeah the gas within it will simply

2942.4 --> 2948.1600000000003
press in on itself

2945.119 --> 2949.04
so you could move infinitely in a

2948.16 --> 2952.5589999999997
straight line

2949.04 --> 2955.359
in a looping system potentially

2952.559 --> 2957.119
but it's all about the total volume and

2955.359 --> 2959.44
then what is it pressing against

2957.119 --> 2961.599
well in every part of that volume the

2959.44 --> 2962.48
gas is pressing in on itself so if there

2961.599 --> 2965.599
is no

2962.48 --> 2968.0
at a certain dimension there is no edge

2965.599 --> 2969.04
it just loops in on itself it will just

2968.0 --> 2985.68
like every

2969.04 --> 2990.48
everywhere else be pressing in on itself

2985.68 --> 2990.48
is there a relief valve of some sort

2992.72 --> 2997.5989999999997
might be well i've already considered

2996.24 --> 3001.04
that maybe even

2997.599 --> 3005.76
this realm that it is kind of like

3001.04 --> 3009.44
a contained system within another system

3005.76 --> 3012.559
so there might be other like outer

3009.44 --> 3012.96
layers outer layer containers that are

3012.559 --> 3015.0400000000004
there

3012.96 --> 3016.88
just purely for the mechanical

3015.04 --> 3020.24
regulation

3016.88 --> 3020.2400000000002
keeping everything stable

3024.4 --> 3027.839
so maybe there is like another

3026.319 --> 3030.96
compartment

3027.839 --> 3034.4
filled with water in another space

3030.96 --> 3037.44
with air that i don't know has a giant

3034.4 --> 3041.2000000000003
tube or something to another part

3037.44 --> 3045.04
of the system that we are sitting in

3041.2 --> 3048.0789999999997
because yeah it's all designed

3045.04 --> 3048.48
and it's designed by god so he's going

3048.079 --> 3051.52
to

3048.48 --> 3056.64
yeah damn will apply the best

3051.52 --> 3056.64
most stable mechanics possible

3058.559 --> 3062.079
i'm just thinking like a designer

3063.839 --> 3067.119
so maybe there are other compartments

3065.52 --> 3069.92
i'm not the first to by the way

3067.119 --> 3070.2400000000002
think this up i think like i've seen

3069.92 --> 3074.559
like

3070.24 --> 3076.0789999999997
rob skiba in a disc assumed model

3074.559 --> 3077.599
like he worked on that and he

3076.079 --> 3081.8390000000004
cross-referenced it with

3077.599 --> 3082.4
his own bible research so he already

3081.839 --> 3084.72
also

3082.4 --> 3086.4
in his own ways envisioned that there

3084.72 --> 3089.2799999999997
are other parts

3086.4 --> 3090.1600000000003
of it more like it's he assumed that it

3089.28 --> 3093.28
was like a

3090.16 --> 3095.2
domed disc inside of a square

3093.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
and that there was basically other

3095.2 --> 3101.04
things around it

3097.839 --> 3106.72
and yeah i don't think that's that's

3101.04 --> 3106.72
too unlikely it could be possible

3107.44 --> 3111.839
that it's a system within a wider system

3112.079 --> 3117.119
but there is no infinity at any in the

3115.28 --> 3118.559
wider system either

3117.119 --> 3120.4
we are not like oh we are in the

3118.559 --> 3123.44
contained part and outside of it

3120.4 --> 3127.599
its infinite space no there is no

3123.44 --> 3132.64
infinite space doesn't exist

3127.599 --> 3139.839
in any form but there may be more space

3132.64 --> 3139.839
that's the best you can hope for

3143.06 --> 3146.119
[Music]

3150.64 --> 3155.359
yeah and concerning pressure increase i

3153.28 --> 3159.44
even had a

3155.359 --> 3162.24
a makeshift a makeshift little

3159.44 --> 3164.64
idea i don't know if i could call it a

3162.24 --> 3164.64
theory

3164.8 --> 3168.8
probably not i have very little to tie

3167.839 --> 3171.2
in with it

3168.8 --> 3173.28
but an idea of that maybe part of the

3171.2 --> 3173.9199999999996
recycling system could be tied in with

3173.28 --> 3176.3190000000004
meteors

3173.92 --> 3178.2400000000002
and yeah this seemed to have aroused a

3176.319 --> 3178.8
lot of ridicule with certain trolls that

3178.24 --> 3181.2799999999997
think it's

3178.8 --> 3183.6800000000003
really freaking funny that i said that

3181.28 --> 3189.28
it's so ridiculous to them

3183.68 --> 3192.64
that maybe at the very higher

3189.28 --> 3194.96
regions of the realm that

3192.64 --> 3196.96
well helium and hydrogen should be

3194.96 --> 3199.2
gathering there so maybe there is

3196.96 --> 3201.68
a process going there for say for

3199.2 --> 3204.3999999999996
example electrically

3201.68 --> 3205.2799999999997
that is causing a transmutation type

3204.4 --> 3208.4
effect

3205.28 --> 3208.8
which transforms like under pressure

3208.4 --> 3212.48
type

3208.8 --> 3216.96
transforms the gas into say

3212.48 --> 3219.119
more metallic type substances

3216.96 --> 3220.0
so that it actually the molecules

3219.119 --> 3222.96
themselves

3220.0 --> 3225.359
transform into something else which is a

3222.96 --> 3226.96
lot less dense and thereby taking away

3225.359 --> 3229.7599999999998
the pressure

3226.96 --> 3230.8
see so maybe if the pressure just keeps

3229.76 --> 3233.2000000000003
on conti

3230.8 --> 3234.079
continuing to increase by a lot of i

3233.2 --> 3237.4399999999996
don't know

3234.079 --> 3239.76
gas being released that then

3237.44 --> 3240.64
eventually that'll end up in well what

3239.76 --> 3243.28
would be

3240.64 --> 3244.5589999999997
meteors coming down because all the

3243.28 --> 3247.8390000000004
extra pressure would

3244.559 --> 3250.8
cause the the the

3247.839 --> 3252.5589999999997
lowest density gases to compress and be

3250.8 --> 3256.0
transformed transmuted

3252.559 --> 3258.0
transmutated into potential metallic

3256.0 --> 3260.64
substances that would then gather and

3258.0 --> 3264.0
eventually come down as meteors

3260.64 --> 3266.24
now that's a cyclical theory is a

3264.0 --> 3269.04
cyclical concept

3266.24 --> 3271.2799999999997
that i thought up is it now half a year

3269.04 --> 3271.2799999999997
ago

3271.359 --> 3276.88
somewhere in the last year i think

3274.64 --> 3279.44
and yeah a lot of people that thought

3276.88 --> 3282.7200000000003
that was extremely ridiculous

3279.44 --> 3283.28
but at least it is based on a cyclical

3282.72 --> 3286.319
design

3283.28 --> 3287.599
so i think that that concept solves a

3286.319 --> 3289.599
whole lot of

3287.599 --> 3291.3590000000004
weird issues out there because like what

3289.599 --> 3295.04
the [ __ ] meteors

3291.359 --> 3297.5989999999997
what the [ __ ] is that you know

3295.04 --> 3298.319
yeah that's really a big mystery at this

3297.599 --> 3300.96
point

3298.319 --> 3301.92
well this would give some kind of reason

3300.96 --> 3305.359
for

3301.92 --> 3307.04
the gas situation and like yeah all that

3305.359 --> 3307.92
gas that's going up there that's not

3307.04 --> 3310.799
coming down

3307.92 --> 3311.52
because it will only ever go up because

3310.799 --> 3314.72
that's where it's

3311.52 --> 3316.88
density equilibrium point is and nothing

3314.72 --> 3318.319
will make it come down so

3316.88 --> 3320.2400000000002
that would just mean it would keep

3318.319 --> 3324.96
building up and up and up and up until

3320.24 --> 3324.9599999999996
it's all that what's gonna happen

3327.52 --> 3331.2
right so i just thought of okay well

3329.599 --> 3333.3590000000004
maybe

3331.2 --> 3335.7599999999998
it decreases up there so it's there's

3333.359 --> 3338.799
something consuming it and maybe that's

3335.76 --> 3342.0
the reason meteors come down because

3338.799 --> 3343.68
metals are a lot lot less or a lot

3342.0 --> 3348.079
denser

3343.68 --> 3351.839
less less volume consuming

3348.079 --> 3353.52
as hydrogen and helium

3351.839 --> 3356.5589999999997
so maybe there is something transforming

3353.52 --> 3360.24
it up there something electrical

3356.559 --> 3364.079
and yeah causing eventual meteor

3360.24 --> 3366.5589999999997
meteors to form stick together

3364.079 --> 3367.92
fuse together and then at some point it

3366.559 --> 3371.599
just becomes

3367.92 --> 3371.599
heavy enough that it starts to fall

3371.68 --> 3376.3999999999996
maybe it gets like even like launched

3374.64 --> 3379.7599999999998
well not launched as in

3376.4 --> 3383.92
mechanism but like through some kind of

3379.76 --> 3388.3190000000004
polar yeah magnetic effect

3383.92 --> 3392.48
it like detaches and then launches off

3388.319 --> 3394.88
i don't know this is wild fact

3392.48 --> 3395.76
this is just visualization fantasy at

3394.88 --> 3400.88
this point

3395.76 --> 3403.3590000000004
because i don't know it's just a concept

3400.88 --> 3404.799
but it would solve a couple of really

3403.359 --> 3406.7599999999998
weird questions

3404.799 --> 3409.52
quickly

3406.76 --> 3412.1600000000003
[Music]

3409.52 --> 3413.119
because like what's the alternative like

3412.16 --> 3416.48
oh it's just

3413.119 --> 3419.52
rocks coming from like a rock

3416.48 --> 3421.44
hole a hole that just like god has a

3419.52 --> 3422.799
design where just rocks come falling

3421.44 --> 3425.92
down

3422.799 --> 3428.799
uh that's

3425.92 --> 3430.16
just weird like where are they coming

3428.799 --> 3433.7599999999998
from then

3430.16 --> 3436.16
is there some kind of hourglass

3433.76 --> 3437.119
filled with meteor rocks and at some

3436.16 --> 3440.16
point it's gonna

3437.119 --> 3442.96
run out and no more rocks coming ever

3440.16 --> 3444.8799999999997
you know that's the alternative for me

3442.96 --> 3447.839
tears if you

3444.88 --> 3447.839
if you will

3450.16 --> 3453.52
that makes less sense to me

3454.0 --> 3458.079
or i don't know maybe it was a simpler

3456.24 --> 3461.2
solution and there is just like

3458.079 --> 3464.1600000000003
a hundred billion meteors

3461.2 --> 3465.4399999999996
in a giant hourglass waiting in a giant

3464.16 --> 3467.2799999999997
compartment above us

3465.44 --> 3468.96
and it's just like yeah it's a time

3467.28 --> 3470.0
thing and then sometimes the rocks have

3468.96 --> 3473.599
to come down

3470.0 --> 3476.559
i don't know could be just as well

3473.599 --> 3477.28
but i don't know the transmutation

3476.559 --> 3481.0400000000004
theory

3477.28 --> 3481.0400000000004
also solved the pressure issue

3482.48 --> 3489.119
so who knows maybe that is the case

3485.599 --> 3491.119
but it's not going to be widely accepted

3489.119 --> 3494.079
anytime soon

3491.119 --> 3495.52
and it probably shouldn't be until there

3494.079 --> 3498.1600000000003
is some actual

3495.52 --> 3500.799
physical proof that that can work that

3498.16 --> 3505.359
you can actually transform

3500.799 --> 3505.359
those gases into metals

3505.599 --> 3511.52
if that can be proven then suddenly the

3507.92 --> 3511.52
viability for it becomes

3514.839 --> 3517.839
bigger

3518.079 --> 3523.119
ah modified yeah yeah well molofide is

3521.68 --> 3526.96
not a piece of meteor

3523.119 --> 3530.48
it's meteoric glass it's where

3526.96 --> 3533.2
emit your impacts it impacts in sand

3530.48 --> 3534.48
then the sand turns into glass it still

3533.2 --> 3537.9199999999996
has

3534.48 --> 3539.359
like the gases i guess or the heat of

3537.92 --> 3543.44
the meteorite

3539.359 --> 3546.4
and then that grass glass turns green

3543.44 --> 3546.4
that's modified

3548.079 --> 3552.079
so it has some substance of the meteor

3550.4 --> 3555.6800000000003
in it but it's not literally

3552.079 --> 3555.6800000000003
a piece of the meteor in there it's

3556.16 --> 3559.839
but i know yeah

3566.96 --> 3571.04
how do they accurately predict meteor

3569.52 --> 3574.319
showers well what they say

3571.04 --> 3577.2799999999997
are meteor showers are not necessarily

3574.319 --> 3580.64
meteorites that come down

3577.28 --> 3584.4
but they can't seem to predict periods

3580.64 --> 3588.0
which are there are periodic where

3584.4 --> 3591.119
lights happen falling star lights no

3588.0 --> 3592.079
there's no direct indication then those

3591.119 --> 3596.319
are actual

3592.079 --> 3596.319
rocks breaking away from somewhere

3596.72 --> 3605.839
i think that the yeah the falling star

3600.24 --> 3609.2799999999997
showers meteor showers as they call them

3605.839 --> 3612.0789999999997
i think that they happen as part of a

3609.28 --> 3614.079
electrical side effect of a periodic

3612.079 --> 3617.44
electrical side effect

3614.079 --> 3620.48
that just is visually there on top

3617.44 --> 3622.7200000000003
of the regular standard star cycle

3620.48 --> 3624.4
and the celestial bodies i think it's

3622.72 --> 3629.839
part of the celestial

3624.4 --> 3629.839
mechanics like a side effect

3645.119 --> 3648.6400000000003
so i'm not yeah i think so at least you

3648.0 --> 3652.559
know

3648.64 --> 3656.0
would be good to disprove that

3652.559 --> 3658.1600000000003
because who knows maybe

3656.0 --> 3661.76
can you just imagine that during like

3658.16 --> 3663.44
giant falling star periods

3661.76 --> 3665.0400000000004
you would have a balloon up there and

3663.44 --> 3667.92
like try to like get

3665.04 --> 3670.799
right in there just in there in between

3667.92 --> 3672.16
the freaking star starts falling

3670.799 --> 3675.7599999999998
constantly everywhere

3672.16 --> 3678.72
around it like in what would it see

3675.76 --> 3680.0
would you literally just see glittering

3678.72 --> 3682.9599999999996
rocks

3680.0 --> 3685.04
like that going right past it making

3682.96 --> 3686.799
sound as i've experienced here on the

3685.04 --> 3688.319
freaking ground which is really weirding

3686.799 --> 3690.24
me out still that i

3688.319 --> 3691.92
witnessed that absolutely real there's

3690.24 --> 3694.5589999999997
no illusion about it that that was

3691.92 --> 3696.559
physically real

3694.559 --> 3698.0
will it see something like that then

3696.559 --> 3700.7200000000003
maybe i would be wrong maybe

3698.0 --> 3702.64
it's not part of celestial lights as a

3700.72 --> 3706.16
side effect but maybe there are just

3702.64 --> 3708.319
things breaking loose

3706.16 --> 3710.24
in a certain period and then it just

3708.319 --> 3712.079
starts to break loose maybe there's some

3710.24 --> 3714.0
kind of vibration that is shaking it

3712.079 --> 3714.96
loose at that point and then they all

3714.0 --> 3717.68
just drop

3714.96 --> 3717.68
one by one

3720.0 --> 3723.599
your guess is as good as mine

3723.839 --> 3729.119
it's all still very mysterious

3727.28 --> 3730.67
what do you think that we got it all

3729.119 --> 3732.88
figured out

3730.67 --> 3735.119
[Music]

3732.88 --> 3735.119
no

3738.72 --> 3743.7599999999998
but at least we're learning more and

3740.48 --> 3755.839
more what we don't have figured out

3743.76 --> 3755.8390000000004
and how to not jump to conclusions

3758.16 --> 3763.839
if minerals can convert to gases then

3760.559 --> 3769.8390000000004
gases can convert to minerals

3763.839 --> 3769.839
i don't know can it

3771.28 --> 3778.3190000000004
probably but that would require some

3776.24 --> 3782.799
probably some pressure chemistry and all

3778.319 --> 3784.88
that high pressure chemistry

3782.799 --> 3786.4
so i'm not a sp yeah you would have to

3784.88 --> 3797.839
ask adam meek and you would probably

3786.4 --> 3797.839
know a little more about that

3810.96 --> 3825.839
hmm right so we went to meet yours

3816.4 --> 3825.839
weird me to your story

3825.86 --> 3828.989
[Music]

3832.65 --> 3835.949
[Music]

3836.839 --> 3839.839
um

3864.839 --> 3881.839
hmm um

3890.24 --> 3897.839
right any more questions

3895.76 --> 3900.0
i think like the whole meteor thing kind

3897.839 --> 3900.0
of

3900.799 --> 3912.269
i i rounded that out

3909.09 --> 3912.2690000000002
[Music]

3939.039 --> 3944.1600000000003
uh i don't see the connection there

3940.799 --> 3947.7599999999998
mitchell matthew mitchell

3944.16 --> 3949.2799999999997
you don't think mainstream recognizes

3947.76 --> 3953.3590000000004
the concept of pressure

3949.28 --> 3965.8390000000004
buildup you do think it

3953.359 --> 3965.839
which is why they say so much escapes

3972.16 --> 3979.839
i don't know i don't know if they

3975.599 --> 3979.839
recognize that

3981.359 --> 3984.88
maybe they do say that because it is

3983.68 --> 3988.0789999999997
being brought up

3984.88 --> 3993.839
like hey it should happen because where

3988.079 --> 3993.8390000000004
else is all that pressure going

4026.799 --> 4033.2
a 12 000 year cycle of earth magnetic

4030.559 --> 4038.0
history what

4033.2 --> 4038.0
what are you talking about magnetic

4046.839 --> 4049.839
history

4063.68 --> 4068.8799999999997
now adam uh

4067.359 --> 4070.48
i don't remember who it was but they

4068.88 --> 4074.2400000000002
were asking if

4070.48 --> 4077.68
gases if like if minerals

4074.24 --> 4080.3999999999996
can transform two gases react into it

4077.68 --> 4082.799
then can it

4080.4 --> 4084.2400000000002
be can gases transform back into

4082.799 --> 4087.44
minerals

4084.24 --> 4090.319
through chemistry or something that was

4087.44 --> 4105.839
basically the question

4090.319 --> 4105.839
very broad not very specific

4131.12 --> 4133.839
i don't know

4142.319 --> 4148.56
yeah my surprise some people

4146.159 --> 4150.0
i think everybody knows but i never had

4148.56 --> 4153.52
chemistry in school

4150.0 --> 4156.159
well i had it like in the in basic

4153.52 --> 4156.56
part of the school i never had like

4156.159 --> 4159.679
never

4156.56 --> 4162.88
graduated on that

4159.679 --> 4164.799
so i did like chemistry but i i get the

4162.88 --> 4168.56
rough

4164.799 --> 4168.88
details of it like i get chemistry i

4168.56 --> 4170.96
just

4168.88 --> 4172.799
don't know everything there is to know

4170.96 --> 4175.44
about chemistry and there is a

4172.799 --> 4177.199
huge amount to know about chemistry i'm

4175.44 --> 4189.839
not one of those people that knows

4177.199 --> 4189.839
all that huge amount of things about it

4214.84 --> 4221.1990000000005
hmm

4217.52 --> 4224.8
releasing from the mineral like

4221.199 --> 4227.199
what so

4224.8 --> 4227.92
are you saying those gases were just

4227.199 --> 4232.48
trapped

4227.92 --> 4235.6
in the minerals like trapped in it

4232.48 --> 4235.599999999999
how did they get there

4238.4 --> 4245.839999999999
that's weird

4270.84 --> 4273.84
uh

4277.36 --> 4280.799999999999
hello jason mccormack

4283.52 --> 4287.84
what's that

4291.28 --> 4296.88
thank you robin stanley for years

4296.96 --> 4301.84
right now i've been going for a while

4302.32 --> 4319.36
gaps is in rocks huh

4315.6 --> 4319.360000000001
wow that is

4326.84 --> 4329.84
weird

4344.64 --> 4347.76
all right well thanks for the link i

4346.48 --> 4350.4
guess george sanford

4347.76 --> 4351.52
that does seem to be about well gases in

4350.4 --> 4357.839999999999
rocks

4351.52 --> 4357.84
that i didn't really know was out there

4361.84 --> 4366.719
but that's just so odd like how did it

4364.239 --> 4366.718999999999
get there

4366.8 --> 4374.8
like was it created with that

4370.48 --> 4385.839999999999
was it just formed with that gas in it

4374.8 --> 4385.84
like how did it get there

4388.88 --> 4392.88
they don't know yeah but it's kind of

4391.04 --> 4397.04
weirding me out a little

4392.88 --> 4398.4800000000005
this is like what how did it actually

4397.04 --> 4401.44
get there

4398.48 --> 4401.44
that's just weird

4407.84 --> 4416.08
and yeah even more like if it is

4412.32 --> 4416.08
created with that in it

4424.84 --> 4427.84
why

4437.44 --> 4443.04
university geology teaches it is

4440.0 --> 4455.84
conversion not trapped gas

4443.04 --> 4455.84
oh dear

4466.84 --> 4469.84
hmm

4508.84 --> 4511.84
hmm

4518.32 --> 4522.48
gather some salient points

4522.64 --> 4526.719
send them on the email what

4532.88 --> 4540.56
so i take it that it still debated

4537.199 --> 4544.48
what it is or is it is

4540.56 --> 4547.76
is it settle because i've

4544.48 --> 4550.799999999999
heard some well

4547.76 --> 4552.56
contrary points from some people here

4550.8 --> 4556.0
saying that it's conversion

4552.56 --> 4556.0
not trapped gas and then

4556.239 --> 4563.5199999999995
the pdf definitely does

4559.76 --> 4563.52
say it so

4563.679 --> 4567.84
and this is already kind of old

4578.84 --> 4581.84
1909

4592.84 --> 4595.84
hmm

4602.719 --> 4609.84
turn what

4613.44 --> 4617.599999999999
putting co2 away for good by turning it

4616.64 --> 4623.84
into stone

4617.6 --> 4623.84
what a terrible idea

4662.84 --> 4665.84
oh

4670.719 --> 4679.04
what is this nonsense this is

4674.08 --> 4682.159
complete insanity

4679.04 --> 4682.159
why the hell would you

4683.6 --> 4688.64
literally want to transform when you can

4686.08 --> 4693.76
use it

4688.64 --> 4696.4800000000005
to use it to give it back to plants

4693.76 --> 4697.6
like is there that much of an access to

4696.48 --> 4700.08
co2 i

4697.6 --> 4707.84
this this just seems like complete

4700.08 --> 4707.84
insanity to me

4746.159 --> 4749.839999999999
air diamonds what

4753.28 --> 4756.48
one of those but yeah sure george

4756.0 --> 4759.12
sanford

4756.48 --> 4760.0
and i'm kind of confused though because

4759.12 --> 4762.239
like is that

4760.0 --> 4764.8
real are they literally just trying to

4762.239 --> 4766.879999999999
pump raw co2

4764.8 --> 4768.159000000001
under high pressure into the ground to

4766.88 --> 4772.32
make it crystallize

4768.159 --> 4777.839999999999
that's that's

4772.32 --> 4777.84
just seems completely insane to me

4778.88 --> 4783.12
i thought i'm pretty sure that like the

4782.32 --> 4791.84
atmosphere

4783.12 --> 4791.84
needs co2

4804.88 --> 4811.84
right well cr2 is already used

4808.719 --> 4812.56
in well agriculture related industries

4811.84 --> 4816.639
so

4812.56 --> 4816.639
why didn't they just give it to them

4816.8 --> 4820.56
just get more plants out of it get more

4819.12 --> 4822.48
food out of it

4820.56 --> 4824.96
just i don't understand why you would

4822.48 --> 4827.599999999999
literally just want to

4824.96 --> 4829.679
dump the co2 in a way that it doesn't

4827.6 --> 4833.84
get in the atmosphere it just seems like

4829.679 --> 4833.84
absolute insanity

4848.719 --> 4861.84
diamonds from the sky okay steamy trevor

4851.36 --> 4861.839999999999
i'll check it out

4886.84 --> 4889.84
what

4900.84 --> 4903.84
that's

4923.199 --> 4930.48
okay so how the [ __ ]

4926.88 --> 4932.719
does that work that seems like absolute

4930.48 --> 4936.0
transmutation

4932.719 --> 4936.0
like how the hell does

4936.56 --> 4943.84
do they transform co2 into freaking

4940.159 --> 4959.839999999999
literal diamonds that's there has to be

4943.84 --> 4959.84
some kind of transmutation process

5005.04 --> 5015.84
a creation bear stazmaretz

5052.48 --> 5056.239
yeah i'm being silent right now because

5054.239 --> 5059.839999999999
i'm just reading the chat this is

5056.239 --> 5062.799999999999
this is all news to me so

5059.84 --> 5066.32
this entire chemistry discussion here

5062.8 --> 5066.320000000001
like i didn't know any of that was

5068.84 --> 5071.84
possible

5079.6 --> 5082.96
not entirely the same as real diamonds

5082.48 --> 5086.48
well

5082.96 --> 5086.4800000000005
because they have no flaws

5088.239 --> 5099.839999999999
and suppose it naturally formed diamonds

5091.44 --> 5099.839999999999
whatever that means they do have flaws

5107.76 --> 5114.159000000001
but yeah diamonds i already knew that

5111.199 --> 5114.5599999999995
all kinds of precious gem types can be

5114.159 --> 5119.12
made

5114.56 --> 5119.120000000001
artificially as in they

5119.679 --> 5126.639
they just recrystallize it under

5123.12 --> 5130.48
yeah by inserting it in gas form or

5126.639 --> 5133.52
i don't know they grow it

5130.48 --> 5135.04
just growing crystals under high

5133.52 --> 5138.080000000001
pressure

5135.04 --> 5139.44
and i've known that since i did

5138.08 --> 5142.5599999999995
goldsmithing

5139.44 --> 5144.08
and i learned about gems i already knew

5142.56 --> 5145.76
that's like artificial

5144.08 --> 5147.44
gems have been out there for quite a

5145.76 --> 5150.0
while

5147.44 --> 5152.0
and they're a lot cheaper and they're

5150.0 --> 5155.199
usually better

5152.0 --> 5158.719
it's just that yeah like better

5155.199 --> 5158.719
in more uniform

5160.32 --> 5166.239
but then again naturally formed

5163.36 --> 5167.5199999999995
gemstones have their own unique

5166.239 --> 5170.799999999999
characteristics

5167.52 --> 5173.84
and yeah in the

5170.8 --> 5176.0
jewelry scene often yeah a lot of people

5173.84 --> 5179.12
do appreciate that over just

5176.0 --> 5183.84
the raw perfection

5179.12 --> 5183.84
if they have the eye for it

5184.45 --> 5190.159
[Music]

5187.36 --> 5193.679
but like the idea that that you can make

5190.159 --> 5198.5599999999995
a diamond exclusively from co2 that's

5193.679 --> 5198.56
that i've never heard of that one before

5204.8 --> 5212.320000000001
diamonds are not rare or valuable

5208.08 --> 5212.32
well it's just a raw material

5212.88 --> 5217.76
and can be look it's it is a pretty

5216.239 --> 5220.959999999999
interesting material there's all kinds

5217.76 --> 5220.96
of things you can do with it

5222.48 --> 5227.36
but it's not it's not really precious

5227.76 --> 5231.679
because you can't make it artificially

5237.12 --> 5243.599999999999
no stasmaretz no in the article

5240.56 --> 5244.719
they claim to make diamonds by

5243.6 --> 5248.0
compressing

5244.719 --> 5250.719
co2 and

5248.0 --> 5251.52
what they always say is always the same

5250.719 --> 5254.08
nonsense

5251.52 --> 5257.84
millions of year stories every single

5254.08 --> 5257.84
time because that's what they always do

5259.28 --> 5265.84
they say that it just compresses over

5262.0 --> 5268.8
millions of years and that's complete

5265.84 --> 5268.8
it's just not true

5276.48 --> 5280.799999999999
but they can't make it under high

5278.48 --> 5283.36
pressure in the

5280.8 --> 5295.04
yeah in a laboratory i guess you would

5283.36 --> 5298.5599999999995
call it

5295.04 --> 5301.199
and wait just compressed carbon yeah

5298.56 --> 5301.1990000000005
technically

5302.32 --> 5307.199
it was near a year ago i presented this

5304.96 --> 5311.92
idea

5307.199 --> 5311.919999999999
i did what what do you mean robin

5320.84 --> 5323.84
stanley

5339.44 --> 5344.0
ah robin stanley what are you saying

5346.08 --> 5351.84
which idea

5383.52 --> 5393.84
come on

5394.33 --> 5400.88
[Music]

5397.04 --> 5404.08
don't tell me it was my idea to

5400.88 --> 5420.0
compress co2 into diamonds

5404.08 --> 5423.36
did i say that i never remember that

5420.0 --> 5426.639
right well steamy traveler

5423.36 --> 5430.159
it's partially a rumor that diamonds are

5426.639 --> 5434.2390000000005
precious but in reality

5430.159 --> 5437.04
it's the preciousness comes from the cut

5434.239 --> 5437.36
how they cut the gem because diamonds

5437.04 --> 5440.639
are

5437.36 --> 5443.12
exceptionally difficult to cut right

5440.639 --> 5445.84
so the actual value of a diamond comes

5443.12 --> 5445.84
from the cut

5446.08 --> 5450.32
and that's also where the huge

5447.679 --> 5453.679
difficulty lies

5450.32 --> 5455.679
so yes the material as in a raw material

5453.679 --> 5457.92
is not that precious

5455.679 --> 5459.28
but a well-cut diamond is just

5457.92 --> 5462.4800000000005
incredibly valuable

5459.28 --> 5477.84
because of the difficulty of actually

5462.48 --> 5477.839999999999
working on it and doing it right

5484.639 --> 5491.04
yeah a little frustrated because i

5487.52 --> 5492.88
wanted robin stanley to respond

5491.04 --> 5494.159
because you said it was nearly a year

5492.88 --> 5497.04
ago i presented

5494.159 --> 5498.638999999999
this idea well this idea there's a lot

5497.04 --> 5500.32
of ideas

5498.639 --> 5502.2390000000005
that are being discussed right now in

5500.32 --> 5503.92
chat so i have no idea

5502.239 --> 5508.32
what you're talking about it's really

5503.92 --> 5508.32
confusing and that you're not responding

5510.75 --> 5513.88
[Music]

5515.36 --> 5519.839999999999
all right i'll be back in two minutes

5623.6 --> 5631.84
have you ever attempted diamond cutting

5625.44 --> 5631.839999999999
in my career no

5656.84 --> 5659.84
uh

5663.28 --> 5673.44
hello nathan yamaha 465

5668.96 --> 5676.639
do i think that all wireless

5673.44 --> 5680.879999999999
communication forms and signals

5676.639 --> 5684.08
prove the earth is flat uh

5680.88 --> 5687.52
definitive proof the earth is flat

5684.08 --> 5688.159
well in ways the ex the exceptionally

5687.52 --> 5692.0
long

5688.159 --> 5695.119
distance signals do prove

5692.0 --> 5696.88
that at least it's not a ball because

5695.119 --> 5701.839999999999
there would be obstruction

5696.88 --> 5701.84
geometrical obstruction

5710.719 --> 5717.28
so yeah sure it's part of it

5714.0 --> 5720.639
it's not the definitive proof

5717.28 --> 5720.639
but it's a proof

5723.44 --> 5730.32
a curve by gravity what

5727.04 --> 5734.159
electromagnetic waves are held to the

5730.32 --> 5736.639
curve background you can be serious

5734.159 --> 5738.879999999999
they really said that that is just

5736.639 --> 5743.84
really sad

5738.88 --> 5743.84
that's kindergarten level mistake

5747.199 --> 5753.199
well yeah well for me anyways

5751.44 --> 5757.839999999999
maybe a little older than kinder but

5753.199 --> 5761.119
that's really dumb come on

5757.84 --> 5764.88
how is gravity going to influence a wave

5761.119 --> 5764.88
that makes no freaking sense

5765.04 --> 5768.8
how can a non force that you can think

5767.119 --> 5772.239
of as a force

5768.8 --> 5772.2390000000005
effect a magnetic

5774.719 --> 5785.84
yeah an electro magnetic thing it

5777.84 --> 5785.84
makes no sense

5794.32 --> 5798.08
that's what the navy communications tag

5796.48 --> 5801.04
was taught

5798.08 --> 5801.04
and he believed it

5804.159 --> 5808.239
or he just didn't really think about it

5806.56 --> 5809.360000000001
like it doesn't really matter it's

5808.239 --> 5812.799999999999
basically

5809.36 --> 5815.679
another terrestrial refraction excuse

5812.8 --> 5817.92
like that's yeah it's perfectly flat

5815.679 --> 5820.56
because of the mechanics that

5817.92 --> 5822.2390000000005
make it from a ball into that flat plane

5820.56 --> 5827.84
apparently

5822.239 --> 5827.839999999999
is it that

5856.96 --> 5869.84
anyway yeah that's kind of funny

5880.84 --> 5886.400000000001
so

5882.88 --> 5888.639
hmm people in radar to investigate flat

5886.4 --> 5891.44
earth

5888.639 --> 5892.88
well if they're really being taught this

5891.44 --> 5895.199
this thing that you said

5892.88 --> 5896.0
that electromagnetic waves are being

5895.199 --> 5899.119
held by the

5896.0 --> 5899.6
curve by gravity held to the curve by

5899.119 --> 5901.839999999999
gravity

5899.6 --> 5901.84
well

5903.6 --> 5908.320000000001
if you can then just bring that up and

5906.56 --> 5912.159000000001
see if they're willing

5908.32 --> 5912.159
to critically think about that

5917.44 --> 5925.28
oh all right robin stanley oh it's

5921.04 --> 5928.32
is it snowing out there

5925.28 --> 5928.32
thanks for coming by

5929.36 --> 5932.5599999999995
you still never answered

5934.08 --> 5941.44
what was it again just said

5939.119 --> 5943.679
it was near a year ago you presented

5941.44 --> 5944.799999999999
this idea i still don't know which idea

5943.679 --> 5949.119
you were talking about

5944.8 --> 5953.84
robin stanley but it was some time ago

5949.119 --> 5953.839999999999
anyway have a nice day

5958.639 --> 5960.96
what

5962.239 --> 5967.678999999999
jason mccormack get out of here this is

5964.84 --> 5971.04
nonsense

5967.679 --> 5974.08
gravity waves perpetuation

5971.04 --> 5974.08
in the ether

5975.04 --> 5981.84
plasma bark land currents what the [ __ ]

5978.56 --> 5981.84
is that supposed to be

6003.6 --> 6008.4800000000005
yeah jason mcrob i don't know you i hope

6005.92 --> 6011.28
you meant that sarcastically

6008.48 --> 6011.839999999999
because that was just a bunch of techno

6011.28 --> 6015.199
babble

6011.84 --> 6023.84
[ __ ] if i ever saw anything any

6015.199 --> 6023.839999999999
this is

6033.28 --> 6037.84
what are you blabbering about

6055.28 --> 6060.4
like seriously what are you blabbering

6062.84 --> 6065.84
about

6076.88 --> 6082.0
ah i guess i'll have to freaking look it

6084.61 --> 6093.839999999999
[Music]

6090.84 --> 6093.84
up

6135.199 --> 6141.119
wow okay well i just

6138.639 --> 6141.679
wikipedi had birkeland current and

6141.119 --> 6145.199
that's

6141.679 --> 6149.84
not helping at all because it's

6145.199 --> 6149.839999999999
ball based [ __ ]

6150.4 --> 6155.199
that's literally ball based [ __ ] so

6155.76 --> 6167.6
that's not really helping

6162.719 --> 6167.6
orbital mechanics no they don't exist

6175.6 --> 6178.88
orbital mechanics are fictional

6177.52 --> 6181.76
constructs

6178.88 --> 6182.159000000001
presupposing spherical earth and freeze

6181.76 --> 6185.280000000001
yeah

6182.159 --> 6188.719
just saying that you can fall

6185.28 --> 6192.08
around it it presupposes gravity

6188.719 --> 6195.36
as a force which it isn't by the way

6192.08 --> 6196.4
it's complete nonsense orbital mechanics

6195.36 --> 6200.0
is fiction it's

6196.4 --> 6200.0
mathematical created

6200.4 --> 6204.719
a huge amount of presupposition based

6216.84 --> 6219.84
fiction

6230.0 --> 6234.32
oh well steamy traveler quantum

6233.44 --> 6237.678999999999
computers

6234.32 --> 6238.5599999999995
it's it's just computers they call it

6237.679 --> 6241.76
quantum but

6238.56 --> 6245.6
it has nothing to do really with quantum

6241.76 --> 6247.4400000000005
like seriously i think this is a

6245.6 --> 6249.04
fictional cover i don't think it has

6247.44 --> 6251.5199999999995
anything to do with quantum ed

6249.04 --> 6251.5199999999995
anymore

6255.679 --> 6259.04
but yeah they're making it faster and

6257.76 --> 6261.360000000001
faster and

6259.04 --> 6262.239
i think that everything you described

6261.36 --> 6265.5199999999995
has already

6262.239 --> 6269.199
been the case for like the last

6265.52 --> 6272.320000000001
20 years so they can

6269.199 --> 6273.04
they we don't know who they is in this

6272.32 --> 6277.28
case can

6273.04 --> 6277.28
pretty much already get in everything

6279.199 --> 6287.36
like if they really needed to they would

6283.52 --> 6290.88
everything it's just that they don't

6287.36 --> 6290.88
because they don't really need to

6292.88 --> 6303.84
no evidence

6312.159 --> 6317.04
no the iss is not anywhere it might be

6315.199 --> 6318.08
in a pool somewhere over here in the

6317.04 --> 6320.0
netherlands

6318.08 --> 6321.199
that's about it maybe other places they

6320.0 --> 6324.639
have the same pool

6321.199 --> 6330.239
the same setup that's it

6324.639 --> 6335.04
it's just props cgi

6330.239 --> 6335.04
it's not generated it's computer edited

6336.96 --> 6343.199
it's not literally just a virtual 3d

6340.0 --> 6345.6
rendering they do take real footage it's

6343.199 --> 6349.119
just trickery

6345.6 --> 6351.04
like star wars models that's what's

6349.119 --> 6355.839999999999
happening

6351.04 --> 6359.84
with the iss partially

6355.84 --> 6359.84
you know the times they utilize the pool

6360.6 --> 6363.879000000001
[Music]

6366.96 --> 6369.84
of their evidence

6371.199 --> 6373.839999999999
probably

6376.88 --> 6380.0
if that if you can even call it evidence

6379.36 --> 6383.28
if you just

6380.0 --> 6383.28
assume it's all real

6384.48 --> 6389.44
then you might call it evidence i highly

6387.04 --> 6389.44
doubt it

6391.44 --> 6396.0
over will we go it's so i know i know

6394.239 --> 6399.599999999999
you're all squirting over it

6396.0 --> 6402.639
it's very overwhelming to you

6399.6 --> 6406.2390000000005
glorious curvature

6402.639 --> 6410.08
all of the ball and it must be real

6406.239 --> 6410.08
because there's so much of it

6410.46 --> 6413.659
[Music]

6419.92 --> 6426.84
no i think i'm just gonna kick you

6423.36 --> 6429.839999999999
because you're spammer and you're

6426.84 --> 6429.84
annoying

6454.56 --> 6457.84
satellite surveillance

6492.159 --> 6497.92
okay nathan yamaha

6495.52 --> 6499.84
you have friends that work in military

6497.92 --> 6501.84
satellite surveillance and you keep

6499.84 --> 6506.08
trying to get them to

6501.84 --> 6506.08
talk to co-workers who

6506.199 --> 6513.678999999999
authoritate them i don't dude

6510.639 --> 6516.88
they get they can get

6513.679 --> 6519.52
images when and where other please

6516.88 --> 6519.52
real time

6524.84 --> 6527.84
operate

6529.679 --> 6534.2390000000005
well can they look what does that mean

6532.56 --> 6535.4400000000005
does that mean they have a blimp up

6534.239 --> 6537.44
there

6535.44 --> 6538.719
like they said they were doing what is

6537.44 --> 6542.159
it 10 years ago

6538.719 --> 6544.56
sending giant blimps up there with like

6542.159 --> 6546.08
super high-tech surveillance equipment

6544.56 --> 6547.84
admittedly so during the

6546.08 --> 6550.239
obama administration did everybody

6547.84 --> 6553.119000000001
forget that happened

6550.239 --> 6555.04
right yeah so sure they can get it and

6553.119 --> 6556.48
they just call it a freaking satellite

6555.04 --> 6558.639
because it's really high up

6556.48 --> 6561.759999999999
and just say this is a satellite yeah i

6558.639 --> 6564.159000000001
know it looks exactly like a blimp

6561.76 --> 6564.88
it's a satellite because we [ __ ] say

6564.159 --> 6569.839999999999
it's a damn

6564.88 --> 6569.84
satellite that's the reality of it

6587.599 --> 6591.28
blimp or some kind of perpetually

6590.4 --> 6594.4
hovering

6591.28 --> 6596.159
drone like floaty plane

6594.4 --> 6597.679
who knows what they have up there they

6596.159 --> 6602.0
can get keep things

6597.679 --> 6604.32
up there very long

6602.0 --> 6607.28
and yeah they have the equipment it's

6604.32 --> 6610.0
not satellites though it's like a

6607.28 --> 6611.28
endless amount of possibilities except

6610.0 --> 6615.199
satellites

6611.28 --> 6617.92
because relative density doesn't end

6615.199 --> 6620.32
at some distance from the surface of the

6617.92 --> 6622.4800000000005
earth it doesn't end it doesn't decrease

6620.32 --> 6625.679
it's just constant relative density is

6622.48 --> 6629.598999999999
always at work

6625.679 --> 6633.36
so there is no orbit there's no box

6629.599 --> 6634.4800000000005
floating up there geostationary can you

6633.36 --> 6638.0
freaking imagine

6634.48 --> 6640.799999999999
a floating geostationary thing it's just

6638.0 --> 6640.8
preposterous

6642.0 --> 6649.199
and there's not flying satellites over

6645.36 --> 6653.839999999999
either it's all other things

6649.199 --> 6653.839999999999
than satellites

6658.239 --> 6667.839999999999
remote drones sure

6701.28 --> 6706.84
okay george sanford i don't know why you

6703.28 --> 6709.84
brought that one up but that's creepy as

6706.84 --> 6709.84
[ __ ]

6720.4 --> 6723.92
right so if you have guys in an

6722.0 --> 6727.28
operating room

6723.92 --> 6729.28
controlling a drone or controlling a

6727.28 --> 6731.679
satellite

6729.28 --> 6733.44
will they know the difference when

6731.679 --> 6735.84
they're doing it if the opera

6733.44 --> 6739.598999999999
if it if it they are literally told no

6735.84 --> 6741.92
it just handles the exact same

6739.599 --> 6744.2390000000005
like this is a satellite yeah i know it

6741.92 --> 6747.04
operates exactly like a drone

6744.239 --> 6749.678999999999
because it just does stop asking

6747.04 --> 6751.84
questions and just do your damn job

6749.679 --> 6751.84
right

6757.44 --> 6761.44
that's probably very close to how it

6759.44 --> 6763.839999999999
happens

6761.44 --> 6765.119
is just stop asking annoying questions

6763.84 --> 6779.84
and just do your damn

6765.119 --> 6779.839999999999
job right

6808.239 --> 6811.28
what zack this is the best two hours of

6810.639 --> 6821.84
your day

6811.28 --> 6821.84
okay i'm glad you enjoy it

6822.639 --> 6831.04
man i really wanna like get

6826.159 --> 6833.598999999999
out there and soak up some of this sun

6831.04 --> 6835.76
so yeah i'll be rounding out the show in

6833.599 --> 6838.639
about five minutes i think and then

6835.76 --> 6842.08
probably i'm gonna not be hanging around

6838.639 --> 6842.08
the flat earth debates too much

6842.4 --> 6849.759999999999
because i really want to catch some of

6843.84 --> 6853.679
that sun before it's all down

6849.76 --> 6863.84
because it does get dark kind of early

6853.679 --> 6863.84
still it's january after all

6888.84 --> 6891.84
huh

6896.4 --> 6900.0
nathan's anger fits oh come on doesn't

6899.679 --> 6904.0
have

6900.0 --> 6919.84
anger fits it's just

6904.0 --> 6919.84
that's just against ballers

6933.44 --> 6939.44
no zack jason is a

6937.199 --> 6942.0
concaver he's holding on to that for a

6939.44 --> 6944.638999999999
very long time

6942.0 --> 6945.119
so yeah you got ballers and then you got

6944.639 --> 6947.36
some

6945.119 --> 6949.36
concavers and he's one of them and he's

6947.36 --> 6951.44
holding back and i really appreciate it

6949.36 --> 6954.5599999999995
and he knows that it's conditional

6951.44 --> 6954.5599999999995
for him to be here

6957.76 --> 6963.119000000001
but yeah you probably didn't know that

6959.36 --> 6963.119
yet what is that

6963.36 --> 6967.679
a concaver is practically somebody that

6965.84 --> 6970.2390000000005
believes the earth is not flat

6967.679 --> 6972.0
it's not a globe it's an inside out glow

6970.239 --> 6972.959999999999
that you're standing on the inside of a

6972.0 --> 6976.4
globe

6972.96 --> 6976.4
that's what a concaver is

6978.639 --> 6983.119
they believe in reversed curvature

6993.599 --> 6999.84
no no it's not it's look

6996.719 --> 7003.84
there's sillier things to believe but

6999.84 --> 7003.84
yeah it is what it is

7010.08 --> 7014.719
