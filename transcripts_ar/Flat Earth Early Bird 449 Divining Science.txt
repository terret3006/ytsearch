70.96 --> 78.22
yeah today the weather is slightly

73.46 --> 82.03899999999999
different it seems like the wind has

78.22 --> 85.58
completely died down like it's nothing

82.039 --> 91.7
like what it was yesterday a lot more

85.58 --> 94.1
cloudy haven't seen or felt any rain so

91.7 --> 100.85000000000001
far but yeah the weather is again

94.1 --> 103.78899999999999
completely different and it my body no

100.85 --> 104.80999999999999
this is the difference and it takes some

103.789 --> 107.72
getting used to

104.81 --> 114.92
it's suddenly not having all this air

107.72 --> 117.40899999999999
pressure differences anymore so yeah

114.92 --> 121.549
today I just have green tea with me

117.409 --> 127.34
that's fine also because yesterday I

121.549 --> 130.459
drank too much coffee I got the it's

127.34 --> 133.82
almost expected I got a bit of a manic

130.459 --> 137.23
backlash afterwards after the show it

133.82 --> 140.959
tends to happen you know when yeah

137.23 --> 143.39
tension breaks and I think I directed

140.959 --> 145.64000000000001
yeah I don't even I'm not even sure but

143.39 --> 146.77999999999997
I think I like drank three or even four

145.64 --> 150.35
cops

146.78 --> 154.4
it's just bad but I got so enthusiastic

150.35 --> 159.94
and now I'm paying the penalty because I

154.4 --> 163.57
feel not good too much coffee not good

159.94 --> 163.57
definitely not doing that again

166.209 --> 173.87
like this morning I still had a coffee

170.14 --> 175.76
but even that kind of felt like no my

173.87 --> 178.79
body was like yeah that's really nice

175.76 --> 180.739
but we had enough of that so even though

178.79 --> 183.10999999999999
I did it with some tumeric in it

180.739 --> 188.86
my body was just like yeah we had enough

183.11 --> 194.54000000000002
coffee already so I learned my lesson

188.86 --> 196.67000000000002
just sticking to tea for a while you

194.54 --> 202.989
know just stick to that one cup of

196.67 --> 202.98899999999998
coffee and in the morning from now on

204.79 --> 211.37
so yeah let's see you is in check

207.849 --> 220.25
hmm was first John op thou o Bamako

211.37 --> 227.5
flatter spaceman david Kapiti Voynich

220.25 --> 227.5
Amanda young yeah good to see you

227.93 --> 238.23000000000002
yeah yesterday as I said I was once a

232.65 --> 243.84
kava holic Jesus Christ 3 liters a day

238.23 --> 246.14999999999998
oh my god oh oh man that's I don't want

243.84 --> 254.01
to eat that

246.15 --> 255.84
I didn't wanna know this no God yeah but

254.01 --> 260.21999999999997
I've known other people that were pretty

255.84 --> 263.52
severely coffee addicted and also

260.22 --> 266.19000000000005
regular cigarette smokers on top of that

263.52 --> 268.79999999999995
and it just they didn't feel healthy

266.19 --> 272.64
they did realize it but they were just

268.8 --> 275.45
too addicted to staying on that hardline

272.64 --> 277.86
as it were

275.45 --> 280.919
yeah that's never gonna happen to me my

277.86 --> 285.03000000000003
body can't take that and I don't want it

280.919 --> 287.25
to get used to it like that I've never

285.03 --> 289.04999999999995
drank really a lot of coffee because

287.25 --> 291.44
every time when I did it it would always

289.05 --> 294.84000000000003
like coffee for me

291.44 --> 301.01
quantitative wise has more backlash than

294.84 --> 301.01
alcohol does so yeah

312.94 --> 321.19
leaders of pop oh yeah yeah a great

316.69 --> 325.46999999999997
quantities of fizz drinks with a lot of

321.19 --> 328.74
sugar and it is not good either

325.47 --> 328.74
yeah that's

331.229 --> 335.34
yeah it has all kinds of side effect

333.389 --> 337.259
anyway too much is never really good if

335.34 --> 341.75899999999996
anything even if it is a really good

337.259 --> 345.27000000000004
product because your body's yeah there's

341.759 --> 347.189
limits it's a very rare that you can

345.27 --> 355.18899999999996
take a substance without some kind of

347.189 --> 358.77000000000004
detriment when you overdo it yeah anyway

355.189 --> 361.249
I'll get over it so yesterday I went

358.77 --> 370.56
yeah back on the debates and it was good

361.249 --> 372.089
it was very pleasant and yeah it felt

370.56 --> 378.089
good again

372.089 --> 381.689
and Nathan was very pleasant and yeah so

378.089 --> 384.3
I guess that the the week break has been

381.689 --> 390.21000000000004
a week exactly pretty much it has been

384.3 --> 395.669
enough and ranty is out of the club

390.21 --> 398.31
hey right well yeah well he did what he

395.669 --> 401.49
did and he has his attitude and he's

398.31 --> 404.089
kind of unrepentant in certain ways so

401.49 --> 407.43
yeah that's kind of the consequence and

404.089 --> 412.56
it's his choice I think it's very a well

407.43 --> 417.3
aware choice that he's making and yeah

412.56 --> 419.52
at the same time you know he's he's kind

417.3 --> 422.58
of now dipping into the fear porn and

419.52 --> 427.06899999999996
[ __ ] and I just I can't really say I

422.58 --> 427.06899999999996
respect that you know

427.51 --> 436.26
but yeah so you know it doesn't mean

433.15 --> 439.9
that I heard ready now it's just that

436.26 --> 442.06
they're just taking a taking yeah

439.9 --> 444.54999999999995
taking it care for him as I will always

442.06 --> 448.84
be doing with Randy because I've had too

444.55 --> 453.34000000000003
much experience with him not to be on my

448.84 --> 455.65
guard all the time now so yeah every

453.34 --> 461.31
auntie is definitely devoted video guy

455.65 --> 461.31
he has excellent horizon footage

462.33 --> 467.34999999999997
absolutely and he will always I will

465.25 --> 473.92
always credit him for that no matter

467.35 --> 475.57000000000005
what he does pretty much so but just

473.92 --> 478.27000000000004
because of that doesn't mean that I will

475.57 --> 480.15999999999997
be going along with ya with certain

478.27 --> 483.33
narratives that he may be choosing in

480.16 --> 483.33000000000004
our end or anything so

488.62 --> 497.69
yeah I know we did and the problem is

495.8 --> 501.2
that point kind of still stands but it's

497.69 --> 505.28
just it's been out there and that's it

501.2 --> 514.58
you know I that's not what I'm here to

505.28 --> 517.49
do I'm not here to attack people for

514.58 --> 521.349
their flaws I hope you guys have noticed

517.49 --> 524.99
that that is something that I don't do I

521.349 --> 528.6500000000001
like to point out certain things but I

524.99 --> 531.08
even try to fake try to see it as much

528.65 --> 534.86
as I can dividing it seeing it from

531.08 --> 540.14
their angle as I conceptualize it to try

534.86 --> 545.26
to reason why because yeah people make

540.14 --> 545.26
choices for reasons so

553.11 --> 555.8000000000001
yeah

556.45 --> 559.5790000000001
[Music]

560.31 --> 566.529
well Jordan up opt-out in a way it is

563.35 --> 568.36
also kind of a territorial thing you

566.529 --> 571.87
know there's a lot of people on the

568.36 --> 574.029
internet and we all want well if you're

571.87 --> 575.7090000000001
like having a channel and doing a thing

574.029 --> 578.56
you kind of want the attention and if

575.709 --> 581.649
somebody then naturally by what they do

578.56 --> 583.5089999999999
gets in the way of certain aspects that

581.649 --> 586.42
you want people to pay attention to yeah

583.509 --> 592.839
you're gonna not like those people so

586.42 --> 596.709
much for it and maybe try to manipulate

592.839 --> 598.87
the situation or interact to fix it or

596.709 --> 601.75
you can do all kinds of responses but a

598.87 --> 604.11
lot of people have then this baseline

601.75 --> 607.75
response as to do these competitions

604.11 --> 610.36
issues competition I'm gonna attack it's

607.75 --> 615.939
the Suwanee a method and it's extremely

610.36 --> 620.92
annoying and disruptive so I try to

615.939 --> 626.439
prevent doing that yeah as absolute as I

620.92 --> 629.199
can it doesn't mean that I'll get

626.439 --> 632.949
moments where I will be like personally

629.199 --> 635.529
agitated and maybe troll a little and

632.949 --> 637.18
maybe get a little surf on yay you know

635.529 --> 638.829
but it's always got to be in the mode

637.18 --> 643.019
it's not something that I'll do as a

638.829 --> 643.019
baseline ever I refuse to do that

646.93 --> 656.13
I don't want to be driven by yeah

652.39 --> 664.29
neither by anxiety nor envy I just don't

656.13 --> 667.5
it's bad hey Marceline yeah welcome back

664.29 --> 667.5
[Music]

669.27 --> 673.4499999999999
Stacey be

672.17 --> 676.0999999999999
[Music]

673.45 --> 679.61
shouldn't be wouldn't be it's up to us

676.1 --> 681.44
you know people do these things and they

679.61 --> 683.48
make these mistakes and all these

681.44 --> 687.23
mistakes are there to be solved and also

683.48 --> 690.0500000000001
one has to realize that once made people

687.23 --> 692.45
really solve mistakes they don't really

690.05 --> 695.06
make them again so it's a sliding scale

692.45 --> 699.86
it may look bad it may even seem like

695.06 --> 703.9
things are growing worse but things kind

699.86 --> 708.17
of always start out pretty bad like even

703.9 --> 713.63
teenagers or kids kind of get themselves

708.17 --> 715.0999999999999
into trouble mysteriously they they can

713.63 --> 716.81
have all kinds of respect I think they

715.1 --> 718.4300000000001
can blame themselves or they blame

716.81 --> 722.7199999999999
society but it is kind of almost

718.43 --> 725.4799999999999
intuitively and I see it as they take on

722.72 --> 730.19
a challenge with the world they take on

725.48 --> 731.66
the mistake to figure out and but that

730.19 --> 734.089
is like a super higher consciousness

731.66 --> 736.16
thing and most people probably don't

734.089 --> 740.4200000000001
even have any kind of realization about

736.16 --> 744.62
that process you've got to have pretty

740.42 --> 748.01
wise parents in order to even start

744.62 --> 749.69
recognizing that early on and yeah the

748.01 --> 753.89
average person you know it's just very

749.69 --> 756.0200000000001
basic they use their intuition sure but

753.89 --> 757.76
they don't try to model it they don't

756.02 --> 764.48
really try to figure things out as

757.76 --> 766.1899999999999
deeply as long-term because practically

764.48 --> 770.11
they don't really need so in order to

766.19 --> 770.11
get around so yeah

770.62 --> 775.21
[Music]

776.11 --> 782.0500000000001
anyway I heavily wandering off here and

778.64 --> 782.05
my train of thought

784.11 --> 787.369
[Music]

797.96 --> 803.08
that's right yeah I was talking about

800.27 --> 809.06
the challenge that people take on

803.08 --> 813.35
mistakes and well the thing is also yeah

809.06 --> 815.7199999999999
there will be people among everyone that

813.35 --> 817.839
will simply never fix their mistakes and

815.72 --> 820.19
some of them will basically be

817.839 --> 822.86
apparently banging their head all their

820.19 --> 826.25
life with the same problem and others

822.86 --> 829.01
will grow much much much much much worse

826.25 --> 834.47
until they explode something that's

829.01 --> 839.779
extremely wrong so that's just it's just

834.47 --> 842.779
what happens and all these this choice

839.779 --> 845.899
pattern almost cannot really be averted

842.779 --> 848.66
you know it can be nudged certainly but

845.899 --> 851.2
there will always be these cases always

848.66 --> 855.02
there will always be people that are

851.2 --> 857.0
like violently insane for example for

855.02 --> 858.77
whatever reason and sometimes it might

857.0 --> 861.589
not even be figured out like how they

858.77 --> 864.92
came to be like that because can't

861.589 --> 867.74
really point it in history so it will

864.92 --> 870.9799999999999
always arrive that kind of thing you

867.74 --> 875.47
know you can't control the design and

870.98 --> 879.16
this is something that well the typical

875.47 --> 881.5400000000001
obsessive atheists control freaks that

879.16 --> 884.54
that is the thing they can't handle that

881.54 --> 888.8299999999999
they want everything uniform so it can

884.54 --> 891.23
be more functional to the systems that

888.83 --> 893.2090000000001
they want to deal with that they play

891.23 --> 896.24
with that they make money from whatever

893.209 --> 896.8699999999999
they want to do and it's never gonna

896.24 --> 901.5790000000001
happen

896.87 --> 905.6
there will always be a division of types

901.579 --> 907.04
of people and they will always there

905.6 --> 909.8000000000001
will always be people making mistakes

907.04 --> 912.86
making bad mistakes and making horrific

909.8 --> 914.75
mistakes and sometimes they'll never get

912.86 --> 920.3290000000001
over it sometimes they will get over it

914.75 --> 923.54
and yeah in a way this is just the

920.329 --> 926.4399999999999
mystery of the Spirit and creation to be

923.54 --> 926.4399999999999
so

928.6 --> 934.879
but yeah you can definitely push it if

932.209 --> 937.279
you're kind of because on top of that

934.879 --> 940.999
there is also the culture and the

937.279 --> 943.399
culture is kind of like mimic based and

940.999 --> 945.9390000000001
you see that if you put out certain

943.399 --> 949.429
media with certain type of clothing

945.939 --> 951.919
certain type of attitudes behaviors then

949.429 --> 955.009
people will start to think oh that is on

951.919 --> 958.579
the television everybody sees that it

955.009 --> 961.97
must be popular people will recognize it

958.579 --> 965.209
will be not be stranged by it when I do

961.97 --> 968.269
that it yeah it's that basic so people

965.209 --> 969.709
will start to them copy this behavior

968.269 --> 972.7090000000001
you see this all the time

969.709 --> 975.41
like girls or sublease behave like

972.709 --> 976.9989999999999
really [ __ ] because they saw it on the

975.41 --> 980.419
television and they think that's cool

976.999 --> 981.9490000000001
and everybody's like oh right

980.419 --> 984.169
she's doing that probably because she

981.949 --> 985.8789999999999
saw it on the television nobody even

984.169 --> 987.859
says anything about it anymore it's just

985.879 --> 991.549
normalized not that that just one

987.859 --> 994.039
example so you can definitely nudge it

991.549 --> 995.959
but this is purely because of the

994.039 --> 1000.489
presence because of the culture if you

995.959 --> 1003.8499999999999
take that away that nudge that any extra

1000.489 --> 1005.9490000000001
encouragement societally culturally that

1003.85 --> 1008.679
won't happen as much so it's really

1005.949 --> 1011.919
about the exposure that somebody's going

1008.679 --> 1014.949
to be exposed to as to water where they

1011.919 --> 1019.059
will copy their cultural behavior from

1014.949 --> 1022.2389999999999
and then if there becomes a rift in this

1019.059 --> 1023.829
culture then there may be polarizations

1022.239 --> 1026.1100000000001
and there may be conflicts concerning

1023.829 --> 1028.779
that like people may start to make

1026.11 --> 1033.7299999999998
personal choices based upon this

1028.779 --> 1036.639
polarization so yeah and that's a

1033.73 --> 1040.0
challenge by itself not to get too

1036.639 --> 1044.35
polarized but also sometimes you can't

1040.0 --> 1046.929
avoid escalation of polarization in a

1044.35 --> 1048.6999999999998
circle in a certain setup and the best

1046.929 --> 1050.26
thing then if you figure that out is

1048.7 --> 1052.72
then to step away

1050.26 --> 1055.059
otherwise you'll be get get caught up in

1052.72 --> 1055.77
a like a final conflict situation

1055.059 --> 1060.8999999999999
potentially

1055.77 --> 1065.58
or it'd just be endless disagreeing and

1060.9 --> 1069.92
fighting forever but it's not always the

1065.58 --> 1073.47
case though so yeah we typical political

1069.92 --> 1083.16
situations the currents extreme liberal

1073.47 --> 1086.01
and like the the septic the septic

1083.16 --> 1088.44
alternative right yeah I think that's a

1086.01 --> 1091.73
pretty good term to give at the septic

1088.44 --> 1094.44
alternative right that is also like

1091.73 --> 1097.14
attention crabby kind of old-fashioned

1094.44 --> 1099.1200000000001
but every bit divided but yeah it's it's

1097.14 --> 1104.5200000000002
getting pretty weird out there

1099.12 --> 1107.6399999999999
everything but of course there still did

1104.52 --> 1110.52
but that's the septic alternative right

1107.64 --> 1112.8600000000001
is kind of like that also because they

1110.52 --> 1114.65
are just extra pushy they really want to

1112.86 --> 1119.07
get to the forefront they want to be the

1114.65 --> 1123.0300000000002
thing when more sensible right-wing

1119.07 --> 1125.04
people more based like people that

1123.03 --> 1128.52
really understand what conservative and

1125.04 --> 1129.6
conservatism is they're probably not

1128.52 --> 1131.49
gonna do that because they're going to

1129.6 --> 1135.06
be more modest and they need that

1131.49 --> 1137.24
modesty to show in order to prove their

1135.06 --> 1140.94
purity in a way they're their frequency

1137.24 --> 1143.25
so that's why yeah the septic

1140.94 --> 1146.88
alternative right just stands out more

1143.25 --> 1150.42
and unfortunately that is also going to

1146.88 --> 1152.97
rub off more because of that it's it's a

1150.42 --> 1156.69
problem because of the openness and the

1152.97 --> 1160.04
freedom is that septic behavior in

1156.69 --> 1165.51
general whether it be demonic or just

1160.04 --> 1168.6299999999999
what you say things like greed or do you

1165.51 --> 1171.15
want too much mania that kind of thing

1168.63 --> 1173.91
it's all infectious but it's not

1171.15 --> 1177.3600000000001
necessarily evil you know it's highly

1173.91 --> 1179.3100000000002
contested now but you can't really

1177.36 --> 1182.6999999999998
outright say that is evil but it's like

1179.31 --> 1184.49
a seduction thing it is as advantages

1182.7 --> 1187.17
and if you can't control it has

1184.49 --> 1189.48
disadvantages so

1187.17 --> 1192.99
this is the cultural challenge for

1189.48 --> 1195.06
everyone for the entire world because of

1192.99 --> 1200.28
social media because of open media and

1195.06 --> 1201.45
because of freedom of speech but ya know

1200.28 --> 1204.48
freedom of speech

1201.45 --> 1206.63
then the polarization will become

1204.48 --> 1209.04
extreme er much extreme er because

1206.63 --> 1211.71
everything yeah if there's no freedom of

1209.04 --> 1213.8999999999999
speech then the alternative must go

1211.71 --> 1215.4
underground and then that will condense

1213.9 --> 1217.44
it more that will automatically

1215.4 --> 1222.3600000000001
weaponize it more make it more serious

1217.44 --> 1226.47
so it's an inevitable problem that will

1222.36 --> 1229.83
require a lot of thinkers and feelers

1226.47 --> 1237.1200000000001
and and planners to pay a lot of

1229.83 --> 1239.37
attention like how do we fix the the

1237.12 --> 1242.6999999999998
kind of baseline universal culture how

1239.37 --> 1247.35
do we do that all together that's quite

1242.7 --> 1249.24
a challenge now there is pretty much

1247.35 --> 1254.6999999999998
freedom of speech the problem is is that

1249.24 --> 1258.21
people look away freedom of speech has

1254.7 --> 1260.3300000000002
become kind of D weaponized by those

1258.21 --> 1266.7
that are kind of autocrats

1260.33 --> 1268.74
is by commercializing it by tying the

1266.7 --> 1271.47
money into it because then people will

1268.74 --> 1274.11
start the censor themselves and this

1271.47 --> 1278.04
this proof this is proven ly happening

1274.11 --> 1280.32
and even being talked about and because

1278.04 --> 1284.34
yeah people will think oh if I just

1280.32 --> 1286.53
don't say this anymore my company or the

1284.34 --> 1290.1899999999998
platform my mom their political like

1286.53 --> 1294.3
that they might give me a few more views

1290.19 --> 1296.49
you know they're like that so people are

1294.3 --> 1299.34
higher paying ranks you know that read

1296.49 --> 1302.4
scripts and just the average youtuber

1299.34 --> 1306.09
they will censor themselves so there is

1302.4 --> 1307.92
a freedom of speech but it's not freedom

1306.09 --> 1310.4299999999998
without consequences as where and the

1307.92 --> 1312.96
consequences are getting more piled on

1310.43 --> 1317.0900000000001
it's not technically impossible although

1312.96 --> 1319.74
yeah at the same time they can then also

1317.09 --> 1320.79
get certainly much more autocratic and

1319.74 --> 1324.6
just say

1320.79 --> 1328.23
yeah we you are violating the rules and

1324.6 --> 1331.74
we're now shutting your channel down so

1328.23 --> 1333.78
at the same time yeah at that not so

1331.74 --> 1337.14
much for it it's it's like a freedom of

1333.78 --> 1341.85
speech with a cap on it with a lid it's

1337.14 --> 1344.88
not totally free but it's not like as

1341.85 --> 1347.1899999999998
soon as you say the key words that are

1344.88 --> 1350.0100000000002
banned it's like your shadow self down

1347.19 --> 1350.46
no that that's not so what happening

1350.01 --> 1353.4
here

1350.46 --> 1355.68
that's I don't think that something in

1353.4 --> 1357.68
that direction sort of happens in China

1355.68 --> 1362.18
they're pretty rigorous about their

1357.68 --> 1364.71
about their speech what they allow but

1362.18 --> 1368.3400000000001
yeah that's not definitely not the

1364.71 --> 1370.8
situation in the West okay so don't

1368.34 --> 1373.02
don't over exaggerate that there isn't

1370.8 --> 1375.99
any freedom of speech it's just not

1373.02 --> 1379.079
really purely free

1375.99 --> 1379.079
[Music]

1389.48 --> 1392.169
all right

1404.36 --> 1411.4399999999998
uh Jeffrey bill when water evaporates it

1409.22 --> 1417.17
doesn't disappear it is still there

1411.44 --> 1422.14
right well technically it it is like it

1417.17 --> 1425.3300000000002
dissolves in the air so it becomes gas

1422.14 --> 1428.2700000000002
thick gas and it is pretty transparent

1425.33 --> 1432.53
but it does have a higher refraction

1428.27 --> 1439.07
index as a gas in between the rest of

1432.53 --> 1442.61
the gases so it it it physically doesn't

1439.07 --> 1448.21
disappear but yeah you could it becomes

1442.61 --> 1448.2099999999998
more difficult to to visually detect

1451.6 --> 1455.83
what are you talking about

1471.179 --> 1477.7
yeah

1472.419 --> 1482.88
physics love that stuff I mean the funny

1477.7 --> 1485.5
thing is recently here's a funny story

1482.88 --> 1488.0800000000002
just well so funny

1485.5 --> 1491.38
it's ooh never mind but I'm gonna share

1488.08 --> 1493.809
it anyway yeah since I've been going on

1491.38 --> 1496.3600000000001
this court for the ball-busters and I

1493.809 --> 1499.36
have this app and now recently it was

1496.36 --> 1503.2299999999998
very weird because my D&D group we used

1499.36 --> 1507.52
to use a the meetup comm site but yeah

1503.23 --> 1510.01
somebody has to pay for a group and so

1507.52 --> 1512.5
now nobody's paying for that anymore and

1510.01 --> 1514.419
because I guess nobody really needs it

1512.5 --> 1517.419
anywhere we kind of used it just as a

1514.419 --> 1520.8400000000001
contact platform and it worked really

1517.419 --> 1523.95
well but yeah nobody's gonna pay like 50

1520.84 --> 1525.57
euros for a year just so people can just

1523.95 --> 1527.89
do that

1525.57 --> 1529.27
apparently though there used to be a guy

1527.89 --> 1530.8600000000001
that did that and it was very generous

1529.27 --> 1534.85
of him it was a cool guy

1530.86 --> 1536.77
he started it up but yeah apparently not

1534.85 --> 1539.049
anymore I don't even know if he's still

1536.77 --> 1541.21
in the Netherlands because there's also

1539.049 --> 1542.98
a lot of international people in that

1541.21 --> 1546.549
group and seriously from all over the

1542.98 --> 1551.049
world I've had a guy from Bulgaria in my

1546.549 --> 1558.75
D&D group one from yeah both from

1551.049 --> 1563.1689999999999
England from Sweden from what is it

1558.75 --> 1565.96
Argentina from Brazil seriously

1563.169 --> 1569.65
I've had one seriously the International

1565.96 --> 1572.289
D&D group and it was great it was very

1569.65 --> 1575.65
interesting every what everybody brought

1572.289 --> 1578.53
to the table just in little bits some

1575.65 --> 1583.0300000000002
were like really trying to convey their

1578.53 --> 1585.46
culture in in in in choice which yeah it

1583.03 --> 1588.97
was great time anyway but that sides no

1585.46 --> 1592.03
longer up so we yeah we decided to go on

1588.97 --> 1595.929
this court so now I kind of have that

1592.03 --> 1598.4189999999999
platform to arrange the in the sessions

1595.929 --> 1600.3700000000001
with them through this court and I'm

1598.419 --> 1601.8100000000002
also sometimes hanging around in the

1600.37 --> 1605.8899999999999
flat earth debate after

1601.81 --> 1608.95
panel which seems to be running all day

1605.89 --> 1612.46
you night all day night they're talking

1608.95 --> 1614.3500000000001
oh they night it's crazy but yeah

1612.46 --> 1616.24
sometimes I just opened that up see what

1614.35 --> 1625.6899999999998
they're talking about and get into it

1616.24 --> 1627.1
and yesterday it was with zanuck or was

1625.69 --> 1628.63
it our team iced tea or something I

1627.1 --> 1630.76
don't know but this guy that got really

1628.63 --> 1635.47
triggered I would talked about creation

1630.76 --> 1637.44
and evolution genetics also carbon

1635.47 --> 1641.3500000000001
dating yeah we talked about carbonating

1637.44 --> 1643.6000000000001
about the issues with carbon dating and

1641.35 --> 1645.55
how sometimes it is off and apparently

1643.6 --> 1647.1699999999998
there were other bothers that were

1645.55 --> 1650.3799999999999
packing me with this because yeah I

1647.17 --> 1653.41
remember this data it's like thirty

1650.38 --> 1655.69
percent off but the funny thing is the

1653.41 --> 1658.0900000000001
readings are technically it's

1655.69 --> 1661.95
statistical it's not like the readings

1658.09 --> 1666.3999999999999
are 30 percent of no 30 percent is

1661.95 --> 1672.13
completely off a little or huge insane

1666.4 --> 1674.65
amounts that was the issue and there

1672.13 --> 1677.3500000000001
yeah and I think it was sonic you just

1674.65 --> 1679.72
consciously tried the rumpus and red

1677.35 --> 1682.8999999999999
herring get really triggered even to get

1679.72 --> 1685.0
around that to make it reliable to prove

1682.9 --> 1687.3400000000001
it oh and then eventually we switch the

1685.0 --> 1691.33
tree rings and I said yeah you know what

1687.34 --> 1694.9599999999998
tree rings are much more reliable method

1691.33 --> 1697.51
of dating and it would be preferable if

1694.96 --> 1699.82
we learn some kind of technology in

1697.51 --> 1701.62
order to scan trees so that we don't

1699.82 --> 1703.4199999999998
actually have to cut them down or or

1701.62 --> 1706.06
damage them in order to establish that

1703.42 --> 1709.6000000000001
age but that is super reliable and it

1706.06 --> 1713.34
records all kinds of atmospheric data so

1709.6 --> 1718.99
it's like trees are probably the best

1713.34 --> 1723.06
historical artifacts that we can use to

1718.99 --> 1727.84
determine historical environmental age

1723.06 --> 1730.24
situations and even determine specific

1727.84 --> 1732.52
scenarios they will be the best lead for

1730.24 --> 1733.97
true history it's probably also the

1732.52 --> 1736.97
reason why

1733.97 --> 1740.6290000000001
certain controllers in a certain age cut

1736.97 --> 1745.519
down so many freaking huge trees just

1740.629 --> 1748.899
destroyed them everywhere so yeah

1745.519 --> 1753.59
covering up history they know they know

1748.899 --> 1755.09
so yeah that was interesting that we

1753.59 --> 1756.7099999999998
talked about that it just came out of

1755.09 --> 1761.299
nowhere you know I just popped in there

1756.71 --> 1763.22
it's it was kind of interesting I think

1761.299 --> 1765.799
that maybe at some point also I'll just

1763.22 --> 1769.07
go I'll just lend the discard and just

1765.799 --> 1772.039
start doing an idol show with that just

1769.07 --> 1774.289
discussing and maybe getting heated and

1772.039 --> 1777.44
that's good that's fine you know that's

1774.289 --> 1786.32
what such a debate panel is for I don't

1777.44 --> 1788.299
mind a bit of a challenge yeah so also

1786.32 --> 1790.58
the guy asked me like what do you think

1788.299 --> 1795.11
carbon dating is absolutely accurate in

1790.58 --> 1798.71
and I say well let's just say a hundred

1795.11 --> 1805.309
years why well because a hundred years

1798.71 --> 1807.919
you can craft red cross reference you

1805.309 --> 1811.1
still have people that actually lift

1807.919 --> 1813.8300000000002
then potentially there's still some out

1811.1 --> 1817.1899999999998
there up to a hundred years that yeah

1813.83 --> 1819.1999999999998
it's not that uncommon that can actually

1817.19 --> 1822.3790000000001
that you can test things with

1819.2 --> 1829.519
cross-reference situations and therefore

1822.379 --> 1832.6999999999998
also yeah confirm the carbon dating like

1829.519 --> 1836.419
whether the model truly abides by the

1832.7 --> 1838.6390000000001
exact situation because before a hundred

1836.419 --> 1841.009
years yeah there's still historical

1838.639 --> 1843.139
registered things and photographs even

1841.009 --> 1846.769
even but it's much more sparse because

1843.139 --> 1849.11
they're living people can convey so much

1846.769 --> 1852.32
more information than a photograph

1849.11 --> 1855.74
potentially you know not all old people

1852.32 --> 1859.07
are like demented or something no you'd

1855.74 --> 1861.98
be surprised you know some get demented

1859.07 --> 1865.7
and some just get physically very feeble

1861.98 --> 1867.44
what their mind stays great for a very

1865.7 --> 1870.049
long time although they'll

1867.44 --> 1872.24
get tired very easily so they won't be

1870.049 --> 1874.429
able to maintain heavy trainer thoughts

1872.24 --> 1877.3990000000001
too much because they tire out but they

1874.429 --> 1883.159
will have very pure wear wise and

1877.399 --> 1886.399
careful carefully weighed thoughts so

1883.159 --> 1890.1200000000001
yeah yeah and that's what I said a

1886.399 --> 1892.4289999999999
hundred years is probably the best most

1890.12 --> 1895.85
realized that things where I could trust

1892.429 --> 1899.409
carbon dating because yeah there's also

1895.85 --> 1899.4089999999999
been measurements where it's just

1900.94 --> 1906.3790000000001
provably extremely off there were even

1904.19 --> 1910.309
carbon dating readings that they did I

1906.379 --> 1913.49
heard from a baller I think where it was

1910.309 --> 1918.23
pretty much extrapolated from the data

1913.49 --> 1921.6200000000001
that it was created in the future didn't

1918.23 --> 1923.919
make any sense so yeah unexpected

1921.62 --> 1929.299
elements to it it's not as

1923.919 --> 1931.759
straightforward reliable as people that

1929.299 --> 1935.21
trust on carbon dating or was it no no

1931.759 --> 1937.6390000000001
no wasn't yeah carbon dating and radio

1935.21 --> 1939.95
halo dating we were talking about all

1937.639 --> 1943.879
kinds of radioactive based dating

1939.95 --> 1948.919
systems and radioactivity problem is is

1943.879 --> 1952.9399999999998
just it's probably not as reliable as we

1948.919 --> 1956.1200000000001
would like it to be also because the

1952.94 --> 1963.1290000000001
effects can be altered by outside

1956.12 --> 1965.6
influences provably and it's yeah

1963.129 --> 1969.98
alright so carbon dating has its limits

1965.6 --> 1971.9289999999999
and I would say a hundred years yeah you

1969.98 --> 1976.07
could get it pretty damn accurately

1971.929 --> 1980.029
probably on most cases but as for beyond

1976.07 --> 1982.1
that it's gonna be very difficult if you

1980.029 --> 1984.049
just have only the carbon dating that's

1982.1 --> 1987.34
simply not enough if you don't have

1984.049 --> 1992.929
enough cross-references to accurately

1987.34 --> 1994.73
anchor it then it's just gonna be

1992.929 --> 1996.44
relative yeah it's gonna be potentially

1994.73 --> 1998.32
wet finger work and it can be extremely

1996.44 --> 1999.5900000000001
off and then there's no way for you to

1998.32 --> 2003.9089999999999
be a

1999.59 --> 2007.029
to confirm whether that's wrong even or

2003.909 --> 2009.88
it will confuse things so yeah that's my

2007.029 --> 2012.94
issue with carbon dating yeah

2009.88 --> 2015.73
there's not really super relevant a lot

2012.94 --> 2019.2
of things but it does help in when

2015.73 --> 2022.1200000000001
people like to make every claims about

2019.2 --> 2030.659
specific events specific times based on

2022.12 --> 2030.6589999999999
official history radiometric American

2031.11 --> 2041.4399999999998
yea radiometric dating it's becoming

2035.26 --> 2043.149
better though but still it has all these

2041.44 --> 2046.21
things all have their limits and they

2043.149 --> 2048.94
have the their unexpected influences

2046.21 --> 2053.919
that you can't really account for

2048.94 --> 2056.56
because they're not always there and if

2053.919 --> 2060.97
they are then the actual influence can

2056.56 --> 2063.5499999999997
be so wild that yet it's just sometimes

2060.97 --> 2065.8199999999997
it's just practically untestable because

2063.55 --> 2065.82
of it

2073.77 --> 2080.55
now I wouldn't agree to that Aries 106

2076.619 --> 2082.44
but you have estimations and you have

2080.55 --> 2084.3
models and you have cross references

2082.44 --> 2088.44
that makes things more reliable but

2084.3 --> 2090.0600000000004
still historical like if you're gonna

2088.44 --> 2092.669
determine something about the past

2090.06 --> 2095.909
that's basically another category as to

2092.669 --> 2098.04
the functions of the physical reality we

2095.909 --> 2100.02
know as the science a science and the

2098.04 --> 2103.32
scientific method this is not the same

2100.02 --> 2105.47
category you can't really compare it you

2103.32 --> 2105.4700000000003
know

2112.5 --> 2117.6
because with with regular physics you

2115.02 --> 2122.88
can always test it again that's part of

2117.6 --> 2125.13
the core ya function you did that the

2122.88 --> 2128.25
scientific method method has is that any

2125.13 --> 2131.76
one must be able to repeat it like on

2128.25 --> 2133.71
the spot not like all the time has

2131.76 --> 2140.0400000000004
passed you can no longer do it no it

2133.71 --> 2148.17
must be doable at any time to prove or

2140.04 --> 2151.08
disprove the hypothesis so with history

2148.17 --> 2154.91
that's kind of difficult you know you

2151.08 --> 2158.93
can't very manipulate the past so yeah

2154.91 --> 2158.93
it's not the same category

2176.54 --> 2180.699
[Music]

2183.2 --> 2187.0099999999998
are you guys talking about

2199.63 --> 2204.1800000000003
well that yeah hydrogen-oxygen

2214.74 --> 2220.5299999999997
yeah well you know chemistry chemistry

2218.099 --> 2223.38
is still uh what I said earlier in the

2220.53 --> 2227.599
past it is still kind of a model and it

2223.38 --> 2233.369
worked really well but it is not perfect

2227.599 --> 2234.869
it's very practical model periodic table

2233.369 --> 2239.2400000000002
and all that but it's not perfect

2234.869 --> 2239.2400000000002
there's weird oddities

2245.869 --> 2255.339
that really Hanako at it I don't know

2259.57 --> 2262.98
I really don't know about that I did I

2262.45 --> 2271.12
just

2262.98 --> 2274.93
look let me presuppose another angle to

2271.12 --> 2278.56
it that doesn't disclaim it is oxygen

2274.93 --> 2281.94
and hydrogen but that does kind of throw

2278.56 --> 2284.71
off what the whole process of creating

2281.94 --> 2287.32
oxygen and hydrogen from water is

2284.71 --> 2290.35
assumed to be okay this is going to be

2287.32 --> 2292.15
pretty mind cracking ly complicated

2290.35 --> 2294.4
really to really see what I'm talking

2292.15 --> 2297.82
about and this is the real problem that

2294.4 --> 2306.4500000000003
also dation is catching on to that is

2297.82 --> 2312.25
what if when they create the gases yeah

2306.45 --> 2315.85
it's it could potentially not split up

2312.25 --> 2320.47
directly in oxygen and hydrogen in in

2315.85 --> 2323.29
the exact ratio that because how likely

2320.47 --> 2326.8599999999997
is it even that if you have two hydrogen

2323.29 --> 2330.07
and oxygen get gas back together that

2326.86 --> 2331.69
when you inflame that whatever they

2330.07 --> 2334.15
exploded yeah it's going to be very

2331.69 --> 2335.52
explosive detonation that wouldn't

2334.15 --> 2339.85
recommend is very dangerous

2335.52 --> 2342.96
that literally the same amount of water

2339.85 --> 2346.87
would then appear from it because yeah

2342.96 --> 2349.87
transmutation effects it could be that

2346.87 --> 2353.83
the gases that come from them are simply

2349.87 --> 2356.71
not the same ratio that maybe more

2353.83 --> 2361.06
oxygen probably more hydrogen would come

2356.71 --> 2363.64
out of it than oxygen or that depending

2361.06 --> 2366.04
on the filtering system you use you

2363.64 --> 2370.0899999999997
could maybe even just extract pure

2366.04 --> 2373.42
oxygen from it and then dissipate the

2370.09 --> 2376.1200000000003
hydrogen compact it away transmuted out

2373.42 --> 2379.63
of existence maybe even that that

2376.12 --> 2385.0
transform it somehow into more oxygen so

2379.63 --> 2387.27
I don't know I don't know man this stuff

2385.0 --> 2387.27
is like

2390.65 --> 2395.64
it's like pretty shocking to me even the

2393.63 --> 2400.08
idea that what he revealed to me is that

2395.64 --> 2403.73
with the filters simply certain when you

2400.08 --> 2407.63
filter out gas out of a regular

2403.73 --> 2411.33
compounds of different gases that the

2407.63 --> 2414.5
remnant gas that is not being extracted

2411.33 --> 2416.79
basically or that is left out of

2414.5 --> 2419.55
disintegrates that these certain

2416.79 --> 2423.6
compounds just seem to disappear into

2419.55 --> 2427.04
nothing they don't exist anymore now

2423.6 --> 2430.47
that is freaky because there is no

2427.04 --> 2432.9
combustion process at which is presumed

2430.47 --> 2435.5699999999997
even in standard physics that because of

2432.9 --> 2438.63
the reactions that energy entropy will

2435.57 --> 2442.17
be lost you know no it's a filtering

2438.63 --> 2445.8
process it's just pushing through other

2442.17 --> 2448.8
things and then an entire gaseous

2445.8 --> 2456.2000000000003
substance it just disappears

2448.8 --> 2460.05
like what okay yeah

2456.2 --> 2462.4199999999996
the agent told me this like two months

2460.05 --> 2464.76
ago I think or a month ago two months

2462.42 --> 2470.21
somewhere there it's just still I don't

2464.76 --> 2473.5200000000004
know what to do with this it's so weird

2470.21 --> 2476.94
what happens with it does it literally

2473.52 --> 2482.31
disappear does it transform for some

2476.94 --> 2486.02
reason into the other gas why what

2482.31 --> 2489.21
happens there's so much to figure out

2486.02 --> 2492.54
concerning this it's almost as heavy as

2489.21 --> 2494.64
my potential future research project has

2492.54 --> 2497.46
to be the exact nature of what

2494.64 --> 2505.1
diffraction is which is also going to be

2497.46 --> 2505.1
mind-blowing ly complicated but

2505.5 --> 2515.17
one day with me in my lap oh you have a

2509.05 --> 2517.599
lab huh well nose you know I would be

2515.17 --> 2520.569
kind of cool you know I wouldn't mind

2517.599 --> 2522.099
doing some experimentation and with

2520.569 --> 2524.98
physics I don't know you know it doesn't

2522.099 --> 2529.8590000000004
always have to be about the freaking

2524.98 --> 2529.859
globe or a flat earth you know so

2532.17 --> 2543.28
there's just so much to figure out right

2541.0 --> 2545.079
but hey if somebody wants to like use

2543.28 --> 2548.1090000000004
their laboratory to like prove the

2545.079 --> 2550.1800000000003
mainstream I'll just blow their minds as

2548.109 --> 2552.91
I always did as I did with my own

2550.18 --> 2554.77
teachers in school by pointing out but

2552.91 --> 2556.99
you know what about this this seems to

2554.77 --> 2559.03
be an exception to the entire framework

2556.99 --> 2562.3289999999997
you just put down and they're like yeah

2559.03 --> 2564.88
I don't know about that

2562.329 --> 2566.319
that cut yeah yeah so that's what you're

2564.88 --> 2568.2400000000002
gonna experience if you're gonna get me

2566.319 --> 2570.609
over the floor and then you're gonna

2568.24 --> 2572.6189999999997
drag oh look the seats so reliable this

2570.609 --> 2575.0499999999997
is the net and then I'll say that once

2572.619 --> 2578.589
you do it right now look hey look at

2575.05 --> 2581.4300000000003
this look at that how about that if

2578.589 --> 2581.43
that's what's gonna happen

2588.96 --> 2600.43
there is so much more interesting well I

2596.259 --> 2602.589
don't want to step on any toes on my my

2600.43 --> 2604.69
side here as it were because there is

2602.589 --> 2607.109
that day there is the polarization and

2604.69 --> 2611.259
I've made my choice I'm a flat earther

2607.109 --> 2614.0789999999997
it's a pretty heavy consequential

2611.259 --> 2617.41
polarized choice but there was just I

2614.079 --> 2619.7200000000003
can't spend the rest of my life spending

2617.41 --> 2626.5589999999997
energy trying to talk around something

2619.72 --> 2630.519
that yeah so but I think that flat earth

2626.559 --> 2634.119
is still very interesting but there yeah

2630.519 --> 2636.1899999999996
there is so much other things also out

2634.119 --> 2637.96
there that are fascinating and that are

2636.19 --> 2641.98
worth exploring and that'll probably

2637.96 --> 2645.759
even reveal more of the very of the very

2641.98 --> 2649.42
nature of this realm for example

2645.759 --> 2651.489
figuring out electrics and light you

2649.42 --> 2653.65
know more and more and more will help a

2651.489 --> 2657.759
great deal in potentially figuring out

2653.65 --> 2660.9100000000003
eventually like how that how do it does

2657.759 --> 2663.4
the glove of the heavens actually work

2660.91 --> 2667.6189999999997
what is actually has the light come from

2663.4 --> 2671.259
how does it manifest what energy source

2667.619 --> 2673.539
all that yeah by figuring out more the

2671.259 --> 2676.9
nature of light and figuring out more

2673.539 --> 2681.4
the nature of energy we might

2676.9 --> 2684.489
potentially eventually make like a

2681.4 --> 2689.079
physical recreation in some way like a

2684.489 --> 2692.049
miniature by understanding the processes

2689.079 --> 2698.23
that let let that manifest and then try

2692.049 --> 2701.619
to miniaturize it this is sure all Paul

2698.23 --> 2704.799
Roberts really the answers we've already

2701.619 --> 2710.789
worked out sure you have Paul Roberts

2704.799 --> 2710.7889999999998
sure and got everything worked out

2731.559 --> 2742.42
oh and there I almost respected you

2738.699 --> 2748.109
professor Phil Bell but yeah it's hard

2742.42 --> 2750.939
to step away from that presuppositional

2748.109 --> 2752.769
feeling of authority yeah superiority

2750.939 --> 2758.3799999999997
isn't evidence it's tough to step away I

2752.769 --> 2760.779
get it it's a big problem that's a big

2758.38 --> 2763.599
seductive megalomaniacal streak to the

2760.779 --> 2765.989
whole science believe science really

2763.599 --> 2765.989
didn't

2794.45 --> 2799.48
but you're talking about

2824.859 --> 2832.749
ha Tyler Mac that's not true

2828.88 --> 2835.809
Game of Thrones yeah the intro but in

2832.749 --> 2837.459
the intro there's like a son the literal

2835.809 --> 2840.789
position in the center that's definitely

2837.459 --> 2843.1299999999997
not how it appears also you might notice

2840.789 --> 2845.529
that there is no representation in that

2843.13 --> 2850.2690000000002
model animation of any nighttime

2845.529 --> 2858.969
situation yeah it's gonna be a little

2850.269 --> 2861.8089999999997
difficult but yeah they did do that Game

2858.969 --> 2861.809
of Thrones intro

2886.42 --> 2893.819
wow that sounds extremely larvae

2889.809 --> 2897.4
professor Phil Bell extremely larvae

2893.819 --> 2899.589
that's there are so many ridiculous

2897.4 --> 2902.1600000000003
things in the things in that what you

2899.589 --> 2902.16
just said

2914.12 --> 2920.63
you know and by the way megalomaniacal

2917.08 --> 2924.79
that what I talked about it's not a

2920.63 --> 2928.7200000000003
conscious decision it's just the idea

2924.79 --> 2931.7599999999998
that it's all figured out that

2928.72 --> 2937.1299999999997
everything's been done we have we are on

2931.76 --> 2940.76
top of things that that is the scientist

2937.13 --> 2946.34
megalomaniacal culture that a lot of

2940.76 --> 2949.9100000000003
intellects love to use that thing for

2946.34 --> 2953.1200000000003
that that belief and being among their

2949.91 --> 2954.8199999999997
peers to assert that yes we got it all

2953.12 --> 2958.0699999999997
figured out we got a little model

2954.82 --> 2961.94
because we do that

2958.07 --> 2967.28
yeah the superior superiority feeling of

2961.94 --> 2972.94
that like we are in control that is what

2967.28 --> 2972.94
that is and it's false

2980.17 --> 2988.39
so it's not about personal mega lemon

2983.94 --> 2990.91
megalomania like a person thinking they

2988.39 --> 2994.5589999999997
are God or some that not like that not

2990.91 --> 2998.95
extreme psychological adji no but

2994.559 --> 3001.38
there's these cultural effects just

2998.95 --> 3004.77
among your ranks because things are

3001.38 --> 3008.94
asserted are programmed with it the

3004.77 --> 3012.589
superiority of it the superiority of the

3008.94 --> 3016.77
future of science and the progression to

3012.589 --> 3020.49
escape the pains and the weaknesses of

3016.77 --> 3024.21
the past that is the appeal that draws

3020.49 --> 3028.14
in a lot of people into that it drew me

3024.21 --> 3030.599
in it's like a vision for the future and

3028.14 --> 3033.9
the funny thing is I still have it I

3030.599 --> 3036.3590000000004
just figured out that the thing that

3033.9 --> 3040.14
drew me in there is actually exactly the

3036.359 --> 3042.569
opposite of what it says it is and it

3040.14 --> 3046.6189999999997
tries to corrupt people that have that

3042.569 --> 3049.98
actually to basically give it up in face

3046.619 --> 3056.579
of absolute opposition right underneath

3049.98 --> 3060.079
them it's a monster that destroys that

3056.579 --> 3060.079
very dream that it upholds

3082.349 --> 3090.599
anyway yeah I think I'm gonna round up

3086.039 --> 3093.92
the show I will have five more minutes

3090.599 --> 3093.92
I think everyone

3098.64 --> 3102.5989999999997
I also feel better now like I feel like

3100.89 --> 3108.15
they've recovered from some of the

3102.599 --> 3110.309
coffee situation from earlier why do you

3108.15 --> 3114.17
keep on bringing up coffee in flames

3110.309 --> 3114.17
what is this nonsense

3133.48 --> 3139.63
hmm hey Jem yeah concerning the conquer

3137.05 --> 3143.849
I've never seen an actual Concord a real

3139.63 --> 3148.1800000000003
functional one I've seen pictures seen

3143.849 --> 3151.329
well let's just say I have a transformer

3148.18 --> 3156.64
that is a Concord thought it was pretty

3151.329 --> 3158.4700000000003
cool yeah they did they really advertise

3156.64 --> 3160.96
that thing is like this thing of the

3158.47 --> 3165.91
future but then they kind of cancelled

3160.96 --> 3169.17
it it's too bad I thought it was a

3165.91 --> 3169.17
really fascinating idea

3173.0 --> 3176.099
[Music]

3177.87 --> 3184.77
but on the other hand maybe it got in

3180.58 --> 3187.2999999999997
the way of the SATA lune plan you know

3184.77 --> 3190.75
because it was supposedly a plane that

3187.3 --> 3192.7000000000003
was gonna fly in super high orbit orbit

3190.75 --> 3195.16
or just the higher layers how are we

3192.7 --> 3197.14
gonna see that but if yeah if that was a

3195.16 --> 3200.1
layer that then became commercially

3197.14 --> 3203.62
designated to become the SATA lune area

3200.1 --> 3208.2599999999998
then yeah that would be a good reason to

3203.62 --> 3208.2599999999998
cancel such a type of commercial plane

3215.85 --> 3220.71
right into the light yeah and then they

3219.66 --> 3222.81
change the plan

3220.71 --> 3224.85
probably the I'm speculating right but

3222.81 --> 3227.67
it seems viable the set loon things

3224.85 --> 3229.56
especially with Google it is a thing so

3227.67 --> 3232.28
it is just likelihood that now that

3229.56 --> 3237.21
layer is just full of satellite balloons

3232.28 --> 3239.34
maybe probably could be or enough of

3237.21 --> 3243.95
them around that dates but it becomes

3239.34 --> 3243.9500000000003
risky for any super high-altitude planes

3249.93 --> 3256.02
oh cool if they do Mac - on a plane how

3254.25 --> 3259.079
can they do that that's not that

3256.02 --> 3263.27
difficult really they probably figured

3259.079 --> 3267.2000000000003
out how to perfectly prevent the

3263.27 --> 3270.39
oscillation that happens it's like a

3267.2 --> 3273.39
plane when you go faster and faster it

3270.39 --> 3276.44
has air rubbing next to it and then air

3273.39 --> 3282.72
rubbing it you know what that's like

3276.44 --> 3285.48
it's it's kind of like this but now this

3282.72 --> 3289.049
is not a good class it starts to

3285.48 --> 3291.0
resonate from the rubbing of the air and

3289.049 --> 3294.45
if you go fast enough then it becomes

3291.0 --> 3300.089
pretty violent and yeah jets and go very

3294.45 --> 3301.319
very fast they feel and that's because

3300.089 --> 3303.0589999999997
boom yeah

3301.319 --> 3306.93
it's oscillating it's getting wrapped

3303.059 --> 3310.4100000000003
super super roughly by the air now the

3306.93 --> 3315.8689999999997
Concorde it probably figured out a

3310.41 --> 3318.48
system how to like counter it somehow

3315.869 --> 3319.8900000000003
count I don't know how they did it but

3318.48 --> 3323.069
they probably figured out a way to

3319.89 --> 3325.71
perfectly maybe they had like the

3323.069 --> 3328.23
earthquake system remember that there's

3325.71 --> 3330.98
systems pretty expensive though where

3328.23 --> 3333.569
you can build a building on top of a

3330.98 --> 3337.589
platform that is flexible so that if the

3333.569 --> 3342.779
earth starts shaking the platform will

3337.589 --> 3344.43
simply roll oh yeah the ground will go

3342.779 --> 3347.359
back and forth underneath it while it

3344.43 --> 3350.339
stays relatively stable instead of

3347.359 --> 3352.88
crackling all apart by the seams well

3350.339 --> 3357.8089999999997
maybe they figured out a way to do that

3352.88 --> 3361.02
inside of the plane somehow - well the

3357.809 --> 3362.789
side side is getting compressed and

3361.02 --> 3365.52
shaking and vibrating like crazy that

3362.789 --> 3369.63
inside there was a thing that would just

3365.52 --> 3371.369
not be touched by that somehow say the

3369.63 --> 3374.94
same technology it would come down

3371.369 --> 3378.1800000000003
basically - you know when you install a

3374.94 --> 3381.9
hard disk in your computer you have

3378.18 --> 3384.12
like this rubber ring II that you put

3381.9 --> 3386.31
right in between the screws and wherever

3384.12 --> 3389.4
you're gonna do you know why because if

3386.31 --> 3392.4
you don't it's gonna be but because of

3389.4 --> 3394.44
the rubber it certainly yeah that is

3392.4 --> 3398.55
absorbed so I think that what they did

3394.44 --> 3401.4
in a way is perfect that so that it

3398.55 --> 3405.48
didn't matter how fast you would go it

3401.4 --> 3410.85
would always be vibrationally stable and

3405.48 --> 3416.57
that's very admirable but yeah the cool

3410.85 --> 3416.5699999999997
stuff technology is very awesome

3420.65 --> 3427.7000000000003
okay anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3424.02 --> 3427.7
now so thanks everyone for coming

3428.28 --> 3433.65
Oh Ren tu I have a video in 45 minutes

3431.52 --> 3438.0
okay if I know I'm gonna join the Flat

3433.65 --> 3443.9100000000003
Earth debate so I'll see I hope it's not

3438.0 --> 3446.25
more fear porn anyway thanks everyone

3443.91 --> 3449.24
for coming I hope you like to show if

3446.25 --> 3453.119
you did then please don't forget to slap

3449.24 --> 3454.9199999999996
their Rogen's and if you haven't already

3453.119 --> 3456.4500000000003
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

3454.92 --> 3458.55
notification so you know when I'm gonna

3456.45 --> 3459.6899999999996
live which is normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam

time every day

3459.69 --> 3465.54
please also do support me again

3463.349 --> 3468.06
you know I'm good for now thanks to

3465.54 --> 3473.52
yesterday but yeah after the weekend

3468.06 --> 3476.22
it's kind of back so please do support

3473.52 --> 3480.48
me again oh yeah by the way Michael be

3476.22 --> 3482.52
managed to he donated aid a euro through

3480.48 --> 3488.4900000000002
PayPal so that worked out thanks Michael

3482.52 --> 3489.99
B it's a nice gesture and yeah I will be

3488.49 --> 3493.7999999999997
back tomorrow flattered the earlybird

3489.99 --> 3496.0499999999997
number 450 and I'm gonna join the Flat

3493.8 --> 3500.579
Earth debates right after this

3496.05 --> 3505.369
hashtag MIFA indeed over moco so until

3500.579 --> 3505.369
the next video keep it flat

3506.34 --> 3536.7000000000003
[Music]

3542.48 --> 3544.54
you
