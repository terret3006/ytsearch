115.88 --> 121.96

is very cloudy very

121.96 --> 130.399
windy not raining

125.36 --> 132.319
really I've been in the weather so

130.399 --> 135.959
before I started the show I did actually

132.319 --> 139.879
get up decently in time and went out for

135.959 --> 143.599
groceries before the show because every

139.879 --> 147.0
time I get on a show on Saturday and

143.599 --> 149.83999999999997
then I'm done and then I want to go like

147.0 --> 152.04
get like tobacco or something and then

149.84 --> 155.0
store is closed because it's after

152.04 --> 158.67999999999998
closing time so I thought why don't I

155.0 --> 162.2
just go out and get groceries

158.68 --> 166.64000000000001
before so I'm certain I got everything

162.2 --> 166.64
and I do I'm fully stucked up and all

167.44 --> 171.64
that but there is a lot of wind out

169.8 --> 173.64000000000001
there like it was quite the hassle at

171.64 --> 177.55999999999997
times on my

173.64 --> 177.55999999999997
bike going against the

178.76 --> 183.319
wind

181.28 --> 185.72
all right but I'm

183.319 --> 188.51899999999998
here now let's see who else is going to

185.72 --> 188.519

231.64 --> 234.64

right

274.759 --> 283.68
right ah hello steamy traveler windy

278.919 --> 283.68

284.44 --> 290.24
be like some yeah I don't know like in

289.039 --> 293.12
the cloud

290.24 --> 295.12
display I'm not sure how that's supposed

293.12 --> 298.4
to like depict

295.12 --> 300.4
wind cuz that's like a separate thing so

298.4 --> 303.479
I'm just kind of puzzled as to what they

300.4 --> 306.28
mean with that see me traveler first in

303.479 --> 306.28
chat good to see

307.0 --> 311.24
you glad you made it

318.639 --> 324.8
early right well video isn't even

321.88 --> 327.56
freezing or anything so it looks like

324.8 --> 327.56
it's going to be a good

328.199 --> 331.479
show right

332.0 --> 336.52
oh man I made like chili yesterday

334.039 --> 338.59999999999997
because finally like red peppers were

336.52 --> 343.31899999999996
back in

338.6 --> 346.08000000000004
stock Chili Peppers like really good

343.319 --> 348.91900000000004
ones and I made it chili and it was so

346.08 --> 352.31899999999996
hot that like I felt at some point it's

348.919 --> 355.4
like my head exploded from the from the

352.319 --> 357.08000000000004
heat like really hot only one problem

355.4 --> 360.44
though I like I

357.08 --> 362.68
went just cutting the chili pepp ERS or

360.44 --> 366.639
rather like holding them down while I'm

362.68 --> 369.36
cutting it like made my hand like

366.639 --> 371.759
seriously like saturated with the stuff

369.36 --> 374.759
and then like washing it with hot water

371.759 --> 378.16
or whatever is like seriously painful

374.759 --> 380.759
but that's gone but like that only lasts

378.16 --> 383.199
like like 8 hours or something and then

380.759 --> 384.96000000000004
it's just gone after sleep it's always

383.199 --> 388.40000000000003
gone thank

384.96 --> 393.28
God but yeah I had a really good

388.4 --> 393.28
dinner and went under the

396.479 --> 400.599
shower watch the movie that

403.639 --> 410.759
sucked hot [ __ ] sure can be

407.72 --> 412.91900000000004
addictive well yeah I guess I like

410.759 --> 415.039
spiciness stey Traver but I mean it's

412.919 --> 417.56
especially in the

415.039 --> 420.919
winter because it just gets the blood

417.56 --> 423.759
flowing a lot and and I like that

420.919 --> 427.08
because

423.759 --> 427.08000000000004
yeah it's

427.599 --> 432.68
cold right but it's like nutrition wise

430.319 --> 437.08000000000004
it's

432.68 --> 437.08
great like getting all that in my

439.72 --> 447.319
system yeah I can show it to

442.84 --> 447.31899999999996
you let me just show you what it looks

448.319 --> 451.319
like

481.08 --> 485.87899999999996
this thing is

482.879 --> 485.879
heavy

486.8 --> 490.639
Kaboom oh but it looks

491.879 --> 497.08000000000004
great so this is my chili sin

500.159 --> 505.319
car

501.96 --> 507.68
right it's a

505.319 --> 511.0
colorful

507.68 --> 515.6800000000001
spicy pot of

511.0 --> 515.68
stuff and oh it smells great

516.839 --> 523.24
too but it just looks nice and has like

519.399 --> 523.24
all the colors in the world and I like

527.0 --> 531.6
that right so yeah looking forward to

529.56 --> 533.5189999999999
more of that

531.6 --> 538.2
later in the

533.519 --> 544.399
evening and like this is food for 3

538.2 --> 544.399
days so or more but probably just

568.12 --> 571.12
three

573.32 --> 576.389
[Music]

577.64 --> 583.3199999999999
yeah I had most of it kind of already

580.2 --> 586.88
bought like a week ago but there weren't

583.32 --> 591.0790000000001
any Chili Peppers like fresh

586.88 --> 592.92
ones for like a week or more and so but

591.079 --> 595.3199999999999
yesterday they finally got them like a

592.92 --> 598.3199999999999
whole bunch of them and

595.32 --> 601.0790000000001
man like there's a lot of chili pepper

598.32 --> 604.5600000000001
in there there's literally more chili

601.079 --> 604.56
pepper that in there than there's

605.44 --> 609.36
onion like volume

613.92 --> 620.16
wise but it's great it's great to have

616.399 --> 620.16
like a lot of actual chili in

620.399 --> 626.959
there cuz normally I just get a bunch of

623.279 --> 629.16
them and the chilies would be like

626.959 --> 632.68
pretty decent but still like these were

629.16 --> 636.6
like big ju like very

632.68 --> 637.4799999999999
fleshy very fresh Chili Peppers and it

636.6 --> 640.9200000000001
had

637.48 --> 645.12
like I don't know 10 or 12 of them or

640.92 --> 648.12
something quite a lot they were pretty

645.12 --> 648.12
big

650.48 --> 653.9590000000001
so but that's

654.8 --> 660.519
great not going to go hungry this

657.48 --> 662.519
Christmas that's for sure

660.519 --> 666.399
and that's the idea behind

662.519 --> 668.44
it cuz I had a few hungry Christmases

666.399 --> 671.32
like in the past because I didn't

668.44 --> 672.72
realize it was Christmas and then it's

671.32 --> 676.6800000000001
like

672.72 --> 676.6800000000001
oh and I have no

677.2 --> 682.399
food and like everybody's busy and

679.839 --> 686.0
everything and then it's like yeah okay

682.399 --> 688.36
I'm going to have a fasting Christmas I

686.0 --> 689.88
had like three fasting Christmases or

688.36 --> 690.72
something

689.88 --> 695.279
but

690.72 --> 695.279
that's that's now like 15 years

699.399 --> 704.44
ago H but not this

705.48 --> 708.57
[Music]

710.279 --> 714.8
year right and by the way the yeah the

712.48 --> 717.76
chili that you saw that I showed earlier

714.8 --> 720.8
that's technically

717.76 --> 723.36
vegan and like that's a vegan meal

720.8 --> 727.4799999999999
that's like very

723.36 --> 730.2
doable like you don't really need meat

727.48 --> 730.2
if you eat

730.32 --> 736.5600000000001
that I mean you could

733.079 --> 738.4799999999999
probably but you could do very well

736.56 --> 739.76
without right and that's the type of

738.48 --> 742.839
vegan meal you

739.76 --> 745.519
want where you're not left

742.839 --> 747.72
longing but there's just so much stuff

745.519 --> 747.72
in

747.88 --> 751.199
there

750.0 --> 754.16
well

751.199 --> 756.88
chili garlic

754.16 --> 759.88
onions

756.88 --> 759.88
carrots

760.16 --> 765.92
uh red kidney

762.8 --> 768.92
beans Maz

765.92 --> 768.92
corn

770.199 --> 773.199
uh

774.04 --> 780.8389999999999
pineapple did I

776.6 --> 780.839
miss oh yeah uh zucchini

787.76 --> 790.88
yeah olive oil of

789.55 --> 794.3199999999999
[Music]

790.88 --> 794.32
course uh yeah

797.92 --> 804.7199999999999
Buon oh yeah and uh provential herbs so

802.199 --> 807.76
that's like 10 key

804.72 --> 810.76
ingredients and that make it

807.76 --> 810.76
together

812.04 --> 816.4399999999999
and you have to like put it in there in

814.12 --> 819.5600000000001
the right order

816.44 --> 821.44
too cuz there's like yeah you're the

819.56 --> 823.4399999999999
carrot for example you have to like put

821.44 --> 826.8000000000001
it in there like right at the start

823.44 --> 826.8000000000001
otherwise it's going to be way too

833.04 --> 838.56
chunky while you want the the pineapple

836.12 --> 840.759
and the zucchini relatively at the last

838.56 --> 840.7589999999999
part

841.639 --> 847.759
part so that it's not too

845.079 --> 849.3199999999999
snotty not too

847.759 --> 853.44
squishy

849.32 --> 856.0
right so yeah where's everybody except

853.44 --> 856.0
for steamy

863.53 --> 866.799
[Music]

867.68 --> 870.68
Traveler

890.8 --> 896.8389999999999
what day do want go to my dad's

892.839 --> 896.839
house second Christmas

897.399 --> 900.68
day so

903.12 --> 905.36
that's

906.0 --> 909.0
Tuesday

925.079 --> 929.959
yeah are you going to be with family too

927.6 --> 932.72
steamy

929.959 --> 932.7199999999999
I take it you

957.6 --> 963.71
will

960.22 --> 963.71
[Music]

982.44 --> 987.12
right so yeah what can I talk about

985.279 --> 990.319
today

987.12 --> 991.839
uh I was thinking more about gas not

990.319 --> 994.16
having mass

991.839 --> 997.3190000000001
and not having

994.16 --> 998.92
weight I'm thinking maybe I could yeah

997.319 --> 1000.639
but people would have to actually be in

998.92 --> 1002.639
chat maybe they felt this coming that's

1000.639 --> 1006.12
why nobody's showing up because they

1002.639 --> 1006.12
felt I was going to ask them

1006.399 --> 1013.199
questions like I kind of want people in

1010.16 --> 1018.24
my chat to explain to

1013.199 --> 1021.279
me why I say gas has no weight I I I

1018.24 --> 1022.759
just want the evidence that everything

1021.279 --> 1025.88
that I've been telling is not just

1022.759 --> 1025.88
slipped away into the

1027.64 --> 1032.7990000000002
sewers then just go past

1030.64 --> 1036.3600000000001
everybody because I've been explaining

1032.799 --> 1036.36
this so many times now it's

1043.36 --> 1050.799
just like and I'm kind of surprised that

1047.88 --> 1056.919
the lack of fluidity with which even the

1050.799 --> 1059.44
FED team is able to deal with this

1056.919 --> 1062.48
subject like to me there is no more

1059.44 --> 1064.679
confusion at this point none whatsoever

1062.48 --> 1066.52
I got this model in my head it's there

1064.679 --> 1068.24
this is how it works people can tell me

1066.52 --> 1070.8799999999999
oh no you got this or that or this or

1068.24 --> 1072.4
have an object and I'm like screw all of

1070.88 --> 1076.7600000000002
you

1072.4 --> 1079.1200000000001
seriously like you're just

1076.76 --> 1081.48
barely following

1079.12 --> 1084.32
track like I know what I'm doing I've

1081.48 --> 1087.88
discussed this so many damn times it's

1084.32 --> 1090.8799999999999
just there is no more question in my

1087.88 --> 1095.88
mind that I got it right and I've

1090.88 --> 1095.88
explained all sides of it like multiple

1097.44 --> 1103.3200000000002
times no they don't truth matter gases

1100.36 --> 1107.24
don't have weight that's not

1103.32 --> 1111.3999999999999
weight yeah it's not it's colloquial

1107.24 --> 1112.72
weight like some weight but the numbers

1111.4 --> 1116.44
of it are

1112.72 --> 1120.52
meaningless they're not proportional

1116.44 --> 1123.6000000000001
to like unofficial weight right like oh

1120.52 --> 1125.6
what's the weight of this material or

1123.6 --> 1128.12
like the density like yeah that doesn't

1125.6 --> 1128.12
work with

1129.28 --> 1136.6789999999999
gases the weight is

1132.679 --> 1139.159
ignored because it's not linear to

1136.679 --> 1141.52
anything with the material it's just

1139.159 --> 1144.0390000000002
like oh there is some weight colloquial

1141.52 --> 1145.44
weight oh it happens to exert pressure

1144.039 --> 1147.799
but that pressure

1145.44 --> 1150.3600000000001
reading doesn't help you with anything

1147.799 --> 1153.799
it doesn't actually tell you

1150.36 --> 1153.799
anything about the

1153.96 --> 1159.799
material like you can't have gas in a

1157.0 --> 1162.28
tank register some weight and then by

1159.799 --> 1165.6399999999999
the weight be able to figure out what

1162.28 --> 1167.24
type of gas it is that's

1165.64 --> 1169.039
absolutely

1167.24 --> 1172.48
impossible

1169.039 --> 1176.12
yeah CU it's just some

1172.48 --> 1176.1200000000001
weight colloquial

1178.679 --> 1186.24
weight like gases don't have inherent

1182.4 --> 1189.3600000000001
weight these conditions only happen

1186.24 --> 1192.4
under very specific circumstances which

1189.36 --> 1194.84
aren't the normal natural circumstances

1192.4 --> 1197.2800000000002
of dealing with gases you see gases

1194.84 --> 1199.799
don't float around in their own

1197.28 --> 1202.32
containers

1199.799 --> 1204.799
they have one big container they all

1202.32 --> 1208.6789999999999
share most of

1204.799 --> 1212.4
it yeah so gases can only

1208.679 --> 1215.2
be registering some kind of weight if

1212.4 --> 1219.4
you pressurize them in a separate

1215.2 --> 1222.44
container but that weight is colloquial

1219.4 --> 1226.0
weight yeah it's not conventional weight

1222.44 --> 1230.48
it you can't derive any

1226.0 --> 1233.08
information based off the weight reading

1230.48 --> 1233.08
about the

1242.12 --> 1247.84
material so you could just keep chanting

1245.0 --> 1249.64
the same [ __ ] over and over again write

1247.84 --> 1252.28
some more elaborate comments put some

1249.64 --> 1254.6000000000001
more formulas in there make it seem like

1252.28 --> 1256.44
you're really educated when you really

1254.6 --> 1258.76
don't understand anything that I'm

1256.44 --> 1261.159
talking about

1258.76 --> 1263.1589999999999
you don't give proof that you understand

1261.159 --> 1266.7600000000002
what I'm talking about because you don't

1263.159 --> 1270.24
feed back what I'm talking about and

1266.76 --> 1273.4
then using what I'm talking about to

1270.24 --> 1276.44
point out how what I'm talking about is

1273.4 --> 1276.44
wrong you

1278.48 --> 1284.159
[ __ ] yeah just saying nuh this that

1282.039 --> 1287.039
it's provable yeah [ __ ] you you don't

1284.159 --> 1290.0390000000002
even understand what weight is

1287.039 --> 1290.039
[ __ ]

1298.0 --> 1300.36
hello

1303.279 --> 1311.96
wrath yeah so gases obviously don't have

1308.039 --> 1316.08
weight they may register some

1311.96 --> 1319.48
weight but that weight's not

1316.08 --> 1321.1799999999998
comparing in lock step with any atomic

1319.48 --> 1323.279
mass or

1321.18 --> 1328.799
[Music]

1323.279 --> 1331.64
any linear use of the convention of

1328.799 --> 1334.84
weight yeah the convention of weight you

1331.64 --> 1337.48
can actually use that to

1334.84 --> 1342.08
determine at least Properties or the

1337.48 --> 1344.0
density or of a solid material let's say

1342.08 --> 1346.96
and then you can try to figure out

1344.0 --> 1350.36
determine what it is based on that

1346.96 --> 1352.24
weight property that you can derive you

1350.36 --> 1353.6789999999999
can derive the density with it very

1352.24 --> 1356.799
easily

1353.679 --> 1362.0
yeah even with a little bit of it yeah

1356.799 --> 1362.0
yeah with gases that doesn't work

1368.52 --> 1378.24
[Music]

1375.36 --> 1380.7199999999998
[ __ ] is that even weight then no it

1378.24 --> 1383.52
isn't Richard it's not the convention of

1380.72 --> 1387.279
weight yeah when you're talking about a

1383.52 --> 1391.52
kilogram or a pound or a

1387.279 --> 1394.159
carrot right you're talking about the

1391.52 --> 1396.36
conventions of

1394.159 --> 1399.5200000000002
weight a

1396.36 --> 1403.4799999999998
linear number based

1399.52 --> 1406.6
system of Quantas

1403.48 --> 1409.4
amounts that are specifically

1406.6 --> 1410.8799999999999
anchored and that are consistent that's

1409.4 --> 1413.44
the whole thing about it is the

1410.88 --> 1416.3600000000001
consistency yeah that's why it is used

1413.44 --> 1421.76
as a convention because of its linear

1416.36 --> 1421.76
consistency yeah you can't do that with

1426.36 --> 1433.1999999999998
gases you can register some weight which

1430.64 --> 1436.159
isn't conventional weight it's

1433.2 --> 1438.8400000000001
colloquial weight when you shove it and

1436.159 --> 1440.1200000000001
compress it in a tank

1438.84 --> 1442.1589999999999
and then you could put it on the scale

1440.12 --> 1445.9189999999999
and then oh guess what it reads a little

1442.159 --> 1450.3200000000002
more yeah but you can't tie that weight

1445.919 --> 1453.48
registry in with anything that will tell

1450.32 --> 1457.0
you what the material is or exactly how

1453.48 --> 1457.0
much of it it is

1459.12 --> 1465.7199999999998
yeah you can't get anything out of that

1462.96 --> 1469.2
reading that's why it's not conventional

1465.72 --> 1474.279
weight which is the weight that we all

1469.2 --> 1478.32
use it's colloquial weight yeah it's

1474.279 --> 1482.159
just like if you take a bar of gold and

1478.32 --> 1486.9189999999999
you suspend it on a bunch of wies stuck

1482.159 --> 1490.5590000000002
to helium balloons it doesn't mean

1486.919 --> 1493.279
that like that's anti weight yeah that

1490.559 --> 1496.36
the gas is minus weight and then the

1493.279 --> 1500.44
minus weight of the helium balloons

1496.36 --> 1502.6
offsets the Plus weight of the gold bar

1500.44 --> 1505.799
well for practical uses that kind of

1502.6 --> 1509.039
works right the colloquial registry of

1505.799 --> 1512.399
the pressure of the colloquial

1509.039 --> 1516.32
weight will be like

1512.399 --> 1519.799
lessened but that bar of gold is still

1516.32 --> 1523.1589999999999
going to weigh the conventional weight

1519.799 --> 1525.2
exactly as it does it's just being

1523.159 --> 1529.279
subjected to other

1525.2 --> 1533.159
forces yeah not to anti- weight because

1529.279 --> 1536.24
anti- weight cannot exist there is no

1533.159 --> 1538.3990000000001
anti- weight in conventional weight that

1536.24 --> 1541.2
doesn't exist there's only plus and

1538.399 --> 1541.1999999999998
there's

1545.84 --> 1548.84
zero

1554.44 --> 1559.679
[Music]

1556.679 --> 1559.679
t

1566.44 --> 1573.8400000000001
so how does a helium balloon float

1570.0 --> 1577.279
well because the Rubber and the helium

1573.84 --> 1580.799
combined as an object and they are an

1577.279 --> 1582.6
object cu the content can't just freely

1580.799 --> 1584.9189999999999
move around

1582.6 --> 1588.6789999999999
outside well its

1584.919 --> 1592.24
density is lower or or equal if it's

1588.679 --> 1595.64
going to float in place to the air that

1592.24 --> 1595.64
surrounds it

1597.679 --> 1601.76
typically and that's why it's moving

1602.279 --> 1608.48
upward you can't put a helium balloon on

1604.88 --> 1608.48
a scale and register its

1608.799 --> 1614.1589999999999
weight right but that same helium

1611.12 --> 1618.76
balloon that gas inside of it when it

1614.159 --> 1621.88
was compressed in a tank

1618.76 --> 1624.36
then that tank and the rubber together

1621.88 --> 1626.679
put on the scale yeah it weighed a

1624.36 --> 1626.6789999999999
little

1629.52 --> 1636.36
more it weighed a little more and then

1632.52 --> 1639.08
that that compressed helium that weighed

1636.36 --> 1642.6789999999999
a little more was vacated into the

1639.08 --> 1645.279
balloon expanded into equilibrium

1642.679 --> 1649.0800000000002
pressure wise with the surrounding

1645.279 --> 1651.919
medium became expanded and suddenly that

1649.08 --> 1654.12
weight that was registered

1651.919 --> 1657.3990000000001
colloquially evaporate it just

1654.12 --> 1662.08
disappeared like the weight suddenly

1657.399 --> 1663.2399999999998
became anti- weight yeah yeah does that

1662.08 --> 1666.76
make any

1663.24 --> 1668.32
sense it doesn't does it when you when

1666.76 --> 1672.32
you say it like that that is what

1668.32 --> 1675.24
happens though because gas doesn't

1672.32 --> 1675.24
actually have

1675.48 --> 1682.0
weight it's not tied in with the

1678.399 --> 1684.6789999999999
convention the convention of weight has

1682.0 --> 1685.919
no relations to material in their

1684.679 --> 1690.3200000000002
gaseous

1685.919 --> 1690.3200000000002
State it's not used with

1695.08 --> 1699.48
that is anti weight negative

1699.679 --> 1705.3600000000001
weight there is none there is no anti-

1702.76 --> 1708.44
weight or negative

1705.36 --> 1710.9189999999999
weight weight is supposed to be

1708.44 --> 1715.64
materially

1710.919 --> 1717.76
inherent but it only applies to liquids

1715.64 --> 1722.3200000000002
and

1717.76 --> 1725.039
solids that's where it becomes

1722.32 --> 1729.519
consistent reliable and

1725.039 --> 1732.559
repeatable the quanta yields the same

1729.519 --> 1735.44
weight every

1732.559 --> 1738.48
time when it's a gas it doesn't happen

1735.44 --> 1741.88
like that that's why gas is is not

1738.48 --> 1745.44
involved in the convention of

1741.88 --> 1748.3600000000001
weight but you can compress gas in a

1745.44 --> 1752.1200000000001
tank and then it will register some

1748.36 --> 1756.039
weight on a scale but that some weight

1752.12 --> 1759.559
is not the conventional weight because

1756.039 --> 1762.36
gas doesn't actually have

1759.559 --> 1764.6789999999999
weight but the object with the

1762.36 --> 1767.4799999999998
Compressed Gas becomes in this

1764.679 --> 1770.279
equilibrium with the surrounding causing

1767.48 --> 1774.0
that Compressed Gas to exert a little

1770.279 --> 1777.039
disequilibrium pressure extra which is

1774.0 --> 1780.72
still registered as colloquial weight

1777.039 --> 1783.559
some weight not weight that you could

1780.72 --> 1787.159
tie the number of that registry of the

1783.559 --> 1789.6789999999999
weight in with anything that is useful

1787.159 --> 1792.679
in the convention of weight it's just

1789.679 --> 1795.3200000000002
some weight that you can't use for

1792.679 --> 1799.3200000000002
anything other than oh it's this much

1795.32 --> 1801.6789999999999
more pressure that's it

1799.32 --> 1801.6789999999999
hello

1803.32 --> 1808.72
Tommy because I had said anti weight ear

1806.0 --> 1812.279
yeah that was just to examplify that

1808.72 --> 1814.44
something happens that you can't explain

1812.279 --> 1817.44
that doesn't fit in the

1814.44 --> 1821.039
convention tabok that's why I said anti

1817.44 --> 1822.8400000000001
weight that one time right it doesn't

1821.039 --> 1825.279
actually exist in the

1822.84 --> 1827.76
convention I mean you could

1825.279 --> 1829.96
mathematically work with that

1827.76 --> 1832.799
but in the actual physics based

1829.96 --> 1835.1200000000001
convention the really is level yeah you

1832.799 --> 1837.32
can't have anti- weight doesn't work

1835.12 --> 1837.32
like

1849.0 --> 1855.2
that gas has mass that virgin yeah I

1852.159 --> 1858.44
don't need anybody to post

1855.2 --> 1863.799
anything thank you very much

1858.44 --> 1867.919
but yeah gas has atomic mass officially

1863.799 --> 1872.1589999999999
designated or rather the material has an

1867.919 --> 1874.6000000000001
atomic mass designated right which

1872.159 --> 1878.96
supposedly the gas still has it just

1874.6 --> 1878.9599999999998
doesn't actually have it in its gaseous

1879.639 --> 1884.84
state right how do they

1882.399 --> 1888.279
establish the atomic

1884.84 --> 1892.1589999999999
weight of

1888.279 --> 1895.519
a hydrogen or something or oxygen which

1892.159 --> 1898.0800000000002
in the natural environment is a gas well

1895.519 --> 1900.96
they had to compress it until it no

1898.08 --> 1904.96
longer was a

1900.96 --> 1908.72
gas and then they could get a consistent

1904.96 --> 1913.919
weight reading of it right because

1908.72 --> 1917.6390000000001
oxygen it turns into a liquid

1913.919 --> 1921.76
and carbon dioxide it turns into like a

1917.639 --> 1925.1999999999998
solid Crystal crystallizes very weird

1921.76 --> 1926.919
right but that's another state that

1925.2 --> 1929.96
becomes

1926.919 --> 1932.3200000000002
consistent like it become doesn't become

1929.96 --> 1934.3990000000001
more fluffy under lower pressure no it

1932.32 --> 1936.1589999999999
simply evaporates it's just that's that

1934.399 --> 1938.4399999999998
the threshold of the pressure and then

1936.159 --> 1940.88
it becomes a solid and when it's in its

1938.44 --> 1945.48
solid state it does attain weight and it

1940.88 --> 1948.0800000000002
gains that very reliable trait of weight

1945.48 --> 1950.6
the convention of weight and they use

1948.08 --> 1954.0
that to derive the atomic

1950.6 --> 1956.4399999999998
mass that's what you get then that's

1954.0 --> 1960.88
what it's register to have like the

1956.44 --> 1962.96
atomic mass is just like what is the

1960.88 --> 1964.7990000000002
mass that we attain from it while it's

1962.96 --> 1970.159
in a reliable

1964.799 --> 1973.96
state for which they have to basically

1970.159 --> 1975.6390000000001
compress pure gases in order to not have

1973.96 --> 1977.519
them be gases anymore so they can

1975.639 --> 1979.9599999999998
register some weight and then derve the

1977.519 --> 1979.96
atomic

1981.73 --> 1987.24
[Music]

1984.679 --> 1988.159
weight right but that's the that's the

1987.24 --> 1992.48
third

1988.159 --> 1995.48
option or fourth at this point I mean I

1992.48 --> 1997.72
had to show earlier this week about the

1995.48 --> 2002.2
three forms of weight well technically

1997.72 --> 2004.559
it's four sort of because Cal weight is

2002.2 --> 2008.3990000000001
the fourth

2004.559 --> 2011.039
one but colloquial weight is not really

2008.399 --> 2013.7199999999998
an official thing it's just it's just

2011.039 --> 2016.279
weight some weight there's no numbers

2013.72 --> 2021.3600000000001
tied in with

2016.279 --> 2025.48
it right the other ones are conventional

2021.36 --> 2028.9599999999998
weight the linear reliable

2025.48 --> 2033.6390000000001
system and then there is the atomic

2028.96 --> 2033.6390000000001
weight which is like what you find in

2034.48 --> 2040.799
chemistry right it's what the thing that

2038.24 --> 2043.519
they also used with the mole

2040.799 --> 2046.24
calculation to use

2043.519 --> 2049.72
that right and then you have the the

2046.24 --> 2052.04
fourth branch which is pure fiction but

2049.72 --> 2055.5989999999997
still very popular and that's the

2052.04 --> 2059.359
neonian mechanics

2055.599 --> 2062.3990000000003
weight which assumes a whole

2059.359 --> 2065.7599999999998
bunch right and nutonian weight is

2062.399 --> 2068.839
popularly in people's minds tied in with

2065.76 --> 2071.48
conventional weight

2068.839 --> 2074.359
they think people think it's the same

2071.48 --> 2074.359
thing it

2082.28 --> 2087.599
isn't mole what is that mole is a

2085.52 --> 2091.96
specific

2087.599 --> 2094.839
amount it's like a crazy number that is

2091.96 --> 2098.879
theorized H it's chemistry man it like I

2094.839 --> 2098.879
don't even know a lot about mole

2098.96 --> 2105.88
they have to ask Adam mein he'll tell

2101.76 --> 2107.96
you to F details or QE Tobe but uh it

2105.88 --> 2109.92
has to do with

2107.96 --> 2113.16
like a

2109.92 --> 2116.2000000000003
multiplication of a singular

2113.16 --> 2119.8799999999997
atom type and then you have a specific

2116.2 --> 2124.3199999999997
quanta and that multiplication is Mo

2119.88 --> 2124.32
it's weird but they use that in

2125.8 --> 2128.8
chemistry

2142.92 --> 2149.2000000000003
right a flat tire with an inflated

2147.24 --> 2152.2
one

2149.2 --> 2152.2
uh

2155.48 --> 2161.28
okay well inflated tires are not that

2158.8 --> 2161.28
heavy at

2163.359 --> 2168.5989999999997
all I don't know what you're talking

2165.64 --> 2168.5989999999997
about truth

2178.92 --> 2184.359
matters yeah teok it's just mole m

2185.72 --> 2188.72
o

2195.3 --> 2205.19
[Music]

2215.68 --> 2218.68
for

2227.4 --> 2232.44
okay Adam says that I described it well

2230.119 --> 2232.44
that's

2234.55 --> 2238.6890000000003
[Music]

2238.88 --> 2247.0
great oh is it with an e Oh I thought it

2242.56 --> 2248.48
was H in Dutch it's without the e okay I

2247.0 --> 2252.24
guess that's my

2248.48 --> 2252.2400000000002
mistake translation

2258.56 --> 2262.04
mistake are there some people having

2260.68 --> 2264.839
trouble with the

2262.04 --> 2267.52
chat Adam says he doesn't even see a

2264.839 --> 2267.52
chat that's

2275.599 --> 2278.599
weird

2280.04 --> 2284.96
yeah and tabok you are correct and that

2282.76 --> 2287.5600000000004
some weight is just not going to be a

2284.96 --> 2291.4
lot right unless you have like this

2287.56 --> 2293.4
insane dangerous level super high

2291.4 --> 2296.44
pressure tires

2293.4 --> 2299.839
right I mean tire pressure is like it's

2296.44 --> 2302.359
decently pressured but it's not so hard

2299.839 --> 2305.16
that like you basically going to need

2302.359 --> 2308.119
Super Steel and forced

2305.16 --> 2310.0789999999997
stuff like there might be some tires out

2308.119 --> 2311.88
there that are like super mega high

2310.079 --> 2314.6400000000003
pressure for some reason because it's

2311.88 --> 2317.56
more reliable or for something but

2314.64 --> 2320.7599999999998
regulars they're not that pressurized

2317.56 --> 2323.0
okay not that much and when they're not

2320.76 --> 2325.6400000000003
that pressurized there it's going to be

2323.0 --> 2327.96
very little colloquial weight that

2325.64 --> 2331.04
you're going to read of it it's not

2327.96 --> 2333.48
going to be that much heavier at all

2331.04 --> 2336.72
yeah besides like truck tires and all

2333.48 --> 2339.839
that they're very heavy on their own

2336.72 --> 2343.16
without any compressed gas in them yeah

2339.839 --> 2343.16
you barely tell the

2346.8 --> 2352.3590000000004
difference what hello dank what are you

2350.04 --> 2352.359
talking

2358.8 --> 2363.3590000000004
about okay steamie

2365.44 --> 2368.76
huh

2367.49 --> 2371.2799999999997
[Music]

2368.76 --> 2374.28
gas doesn't expand in all

2371.28 --> 2374.28
directions

2374.839 --> 2383.16
wow okay wrath I'm sure it

2379.8 --> 2387.3590000000004
doesn't what does it do then wrath what

2383.16 --> 2390.64
does gas do then if not expand in all

2387.359 --> 2392.88
directions does it go down go boom boom

2390.64 --> 2392.8799999999997
does

2395.4 --> 2398.4
it

2399.079 --> 2404.119
yeah hey seeking star water derp alert

2402.2 --> 2407.64
indeed my

2404.119 --> 2410.839
God anyway I'm going to bite in this cam

2407.64 --> 2412.52
before okay it's cold I'm going to put

2410.839 --> 2415.64
it back in the oven and turn on my

2412.52 --> 2415.64
coffee I'll be right

2425.359 --> 2428.359
back

2462.72 --> 2470.56
yeah by the way I am alone at home alone

2465.76 --> 2470.5600000000004
so I can be as obnoxiously loud as I

2473.079 --> 2479.079
like why is my

2475.16 --> 2479.0789999999997
computer being all heated

2485.24 --> 2488.24
up

2489.48 --> 2492.48
hell's going on

2503.4 --> 2506.4
here

2510.4 --> 2518.2400000000002
Jesus wow Firefox is going berserk for

2513.599 --> 2518.2400000000002
some reason okay let's close that down

2522.76 --> 2530.96
wow literally my processor just cools

2528.0 --> 2534.16
down why the hell is Firefox sucking up

2530.96 --> 2537.92
so much attention from the processor I

2534.16 --> 2537.92
don't get it unsolicited

2545.16 --> 2548.16
discussion

2556.359 --> 2559.2
it just

2559.599 --> 2566.96
floats the gas just floats it doesn't

2563.48 --> 2570.04
expand in all directions it's just like

2566.96 --> 2572.64
yeah it's just sitting there just like

2570.04 --> 2574.599
cotton balls right gas is just like

2572.64 --> 2578.5989999999997
cotton balls this just sits there you

2574.599 --> 2581.079
just have a a a chunk of gas you have to

2578.599 --> 2583.7200000000003
like scoop it up and then you can

2581.079 --> 2585.3590000000004
transport it because it's just sitting

2583.72 --> 2589.7999999999997
there it

2585.359 --> 2591.5589999999997
just right you could just vacuum all the

2589.8 --> 2594.3590000000004
stuff around it

2591.559 --> 2598.44
away can just suck it all

2594.359 --> 2600.7999999999997
up and then yeah it's just just a piece

2598.44 --> 2603.2400000000002
of gas is going to be just sitting there

2600.8 --> 2606.559
pressurized right it just hangs around

2603.24 --> 2610.2
it just floats that makes sense are you

2606.559 --> 2610.2000000000003
sure we're talking about

2617.76 --> 2622.7200000000003
gas and not some weird dream you

2628.2 --> 2634.16
had what does Nathan mean when he always

2630.96 --> 2637.96
says gas go down go boom boom

2634.16 --> 2640.92
that's well that's a claim from

2637.96 --> 2643.319
Newtonian mechanics it's the claim from

2640.92 --> 2647.28
the ballers they think that gas go down

2643.319 --> 2650.119
go boom boom and gravity pulls the gas

2647.28 --> 2654.1600000000003
down to keep it stuck to a

2650.119 --> 2656.6800000000003
bow next to the outer space

2654.16 --> 2659.5589999999997
vacuum which is supposedly endless an

2656.68 --> 2662.839
endless amount of void and like the go

2659.559 --> 2666.2000000000003
down go boom boom part of the gas is

2662.839 --> 2669.7999999999997
what keeps it stuck to the ball without

2666.2 --> 2672.319
escaping immediately into the void

2669.8 --> 2675.3590000000004
that's the idea behind gas go down go

2672.319 --> 2679.319
boom boom now of course it's a

2675.359 --> 2681.319
nonsense construct in people's minds

2679.319 --> 2683.599
because that gas doesn't do that at all

2681.319 --> 2688.4
it doesn't just hang

2683.599 --> 2691.599
around it moves always gas is always

2688.4 --> 2694.76
moving it moves it presses against the

2691.599 --> 2697.0
other gas it moves it keeps moving until

2694.76 --> 2702.0
its direction is changed

2697.0 --> 2704.599
and mixes in so you can release some gas

2702.0 --> 2708.2
somewhere and then yeah it might sit

2704.599 --> 2710.6400000000003
there for just a little bit right when

2708.2 --> 2713.1189999999997
it's still concentrated versus the air

2710.64 --> 2716.68
that surrounds it and then it will

2713.119 --> 2720.8
gradually start to dissipate it will

2716.68 --> 2723.7999999999997
dissolve into the air and then there

2720.8 --> 2725.599
will be no more concentrated gas left

2723.8 --> 2726.42
because gases spread out in all

2725.599 --> 2729.51
Direction

2726.42 --> 2729.51
[Music]

2730.4 --> 2737.2400000000002
it it's not going to sit

2732.76 --> 2739.96
there like even if it's more dense a gas

2737.24 --> 2741.319
than the air it's not just going to sit

2739.96 --> 2744.599
in an

2741.319 --> 2747.5589999999997
aquarium yeah it might sit there for

2744.599 --> 2750.559
maybe a minute or something maybe more

2747.559 --> 2753.6800000000003
and it's gradually going to dissolve

2750.559 --> 2753.6800000000003
until it's

2754.16 --> 2761.319
equal with the surrounding in air

2757.359 --> 2761.319
because gas expands in all

2764.079 --> 2768.4
Direction gas only moves under pressure

2766.96 --> 2772.52
what are you talking

2768.4 --> 2772.52
about it is the

2773.559 --> 2779.599
pressure gas

2775.52 --> 2779.599
pressure that is what it

2780.319 --> 2786.44
is the pressure it moves under gas

2784.4 --> 2788.1600000000003
always presses

2786.44 --> 2794.2000000000003
that's what makes it

2788.16 --> 2796.8799999999997
gas it is pressing that's why it's

2794.2 --> 2799.5589999999997
gas presses in all directions to fill

2796.88 --> 2799.559
the available

2801.839 --> 2808.2799999999997
volume you can't have gas not pressing

2805.4 --> 2813.04
it always presses it always presses in

2808.28 --> 2815.599
all directions always that's why it's

2813.04 --> 2817.2
gas relative no it has nothing to do

2815.599 --> 2821.1600000000003
with pressure

2817.2 --> 2821.16
equilibrium it presses in all

2825.48 --> 2830.16
directions oh well that's just what gas

2835.78 --> 2839.0190000000002
[Music]

2844.72 --> 2847.72
does

2859.079 --> 2862.2400000000002
what the [ __ ] going on

2866.96 --> 2869.96
here

2874.72 --> 2877.72
okay

2911.13 --> 2916.8
[Music]

2913.16 --> 2918.8399999999997
wait oh he's talking about the chat in

2916.8 --> 2922.1690000000003
view that's

2918.84 --> 2922.1690000000003
[Music]

2923.839 --> 2928.4
weird it just says try to

2930.16 --> 2936.1189999999997
reconnect that's weird oh oh I just had

2934.2 --> 2937.72
to refresh it it's there there the

2936.119 --> 2940.7200000000003
chat's there

2937.72 --> 2940.72
now

2946.67 --> 2950.949
[Music]

2952.799 --> 2958.96
huh right thanks for telling me Adam I I

2956.52 --> 2961.88
didn't know it is that but yeah the the

2958.96 --> 2964.52
chat is there on screen

2961.88 --> 2967.52
now

2964.52 --> 2967.52
h

2972.319 --> 2976.27
yeah that's correct steam traveler mass

2974.44 --> 2978.92
is an abstract

2976.27 --> 2980.5
[Music]

2978.92 --> 2982.359
construct I

2980.5 --> 2985.24
[Music]

2982.359 --> 2989.4
thought no no no no that's correct gas

2985.24 --> 2989.3999999999996
does not have

2991.319 --> 2998.48
mass yeah you can't create a weight with

2995.599 --> 3000.44
it you can't use it for the convention

2998.48 --> 3003.52
of

3000.44 --> 3005.839
weight yeah you can't use it for

3003.52 --> 3008.799
Newtonian mechanics either I mean people

3005.839 --> 3011.16
think they can by imagining that gas go

3008.799 --> 3012.799
down go boom boom which it doesn't it

3011.16 --> 3015.799
provably

3012.799 --> 3015.799
doesn't

3024.44 --> 3029.599
right yeah you're just a Channing [ __ ]

3027.319 --> 3033.48
with and I'm going to kick you out truth

3029.599 --> 3036.3590000000004
truth matters you're just a [ __ ]

3033.48 --> 3039.28
liar get the [ __ ] out of my chat

3036.359 --> 3039.2799999999997
doubling down

3054.44 --> 3057.44
liar

3084.359 --> 3087.359
for

3109.0 --> 3113.559
okay I don't know what the [ __ ] is going

3114.359 --> 3119.2799999999997
on

3116.72 --> 3123.319
I'm G to try to just watch the show in

3119.28 --> 3123.3190000000004
another browser because this is [ __ ]

3131.23 --> 3147.2
[Music]

3144.28 --> 3150.48
up

3147.2 --> 3150.48
okay let's

3150.52 --> 3158.48
see okay oh crap

3154.559 --> 3161.0
see dude I put it on mute I literally

3158.48 --> 3161.0
put it on

3161.839 --> 3167.96
mute okay is that

3165.359 --> 3169.359
helping yeah it is freaking helping man

3167.96 --> 3170.359
I don't know what the hell was up with

3169.359 --> 3173.24
the

3170.359 --> 3174.24
Firefox browser but it was just sucking

3173.24 --> 3177.24
my

3174.24 --> 3177.24
computer

3179.839 --> 3188.839
H you wanted to ask me if I'm enjoying

3182.72 --> 3188.839
the 32 in no it was broken D

3189.16 --> 3192.839
it that didn't work

3194.41 --> 3202.0699999999997
[Music]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
out

3207.52 --> 3213.2
no he did not send me a broken monitor

3210.28 --> 3216.2000000000003
it wasn't broken when he sent it but

3213.2 --> 3219.2
sending monitors over the mail is always

3216.2 --> 3221.68
risky if you don't box it

3219.2 --> 3222.7599999999998
with if you don't box it in like the

3221.68 --> 3227.799
original

3222.76 --> 3231.7200000000003
box so it just died during the mail and

3227.799 --> 3231.72
that that typically does

3232.319 --> 3237.92
happen oh emailed me pictures okay check

3238.92 --> 3248.559
it dude what the [ __ ] is up with

3243.88 --> 3250.839
Firefox I opened the browser and

3248.559 --> 3254.44
immediately it's getting

3250.839 --> 3254.44
weird what the

3259.88 --> 3267.559
hell

3262.319 --> 3267.5589999999997
wow wow that looks incredible see star

that come

3279.96 --> 3283.44
on freaking

3283.799 --> 3286.799
Mouse

3290.16 --> 3294.0789999999997
yeah okay seeing star water emailed me

3292.72 --> 3296.68
some

3294.079 --> 3299.04
pictures

3296.68 --> 3299.04
pretty

3303.24 --> 3306.5989999999997
awesome that's

3309.04 --> 3314.48
cute

3310.96 --> 3314.48
see Lake

3315.88 --> 3319.2000000000003
Airport that's

3320.599 --> 3326.76
you looking

3323.799 --> 3330.599
good yeah thanks for sharing seeking

3326.76 --> 3330.599
star water I really appreciate

3332.319 --> 3338.2
it that picture with like the mountain

3335.52 --> 3342.68
in the background was amazing by the

3338.2 --> 3346.4399999999996
way you live on that airst strip wow

3342.68 --> 3346.44
okay do you know how to

3347.52 --> 3353.28
fly anyway I'm going to eat this now

3350.2 --> 3353.2799999999997
before it gets cool again

3354.0 --> 3357.0
cheers

3383.92 --> 3386.92
for

3387.72 --> 3392.5589999999997
what was the screen resolution on that

3389.72 --> 3396.48
one

3392.559 --> 3396.48
uh like

3398.359 --> 3403.48
256 like I don't know it was like one of

3401.4 --> 3405.039
those

3403.48 --> 3408.799
2,500

3405.039 --> 3408.7990000000004
something resolutions

3409.52 --> 3414.52
not

3411.2 --> 3418.359
190 19020 is a typical resolution this

3414.52 --> 3420.88
one is like 24

3418.359 --> 3423.24
something so it's like slightly bigger

3420.88 --> 3426.6800000000003
than this the old

3423.24 --> 3429.16
standard whatever it was it didn't work

3426.68 --> 3432.2
it didn't work because the monitor was

3429.16 --> 3434.2
literally broken as in you put the power

3432.2 --> 3438.0789999999997
on it you turn it in and it's all

3434.2 --> 3441.0389999999998
crackly broken glitchy looking lines on

3438.079 --> 3443.92
the screen yeah that means

3441.039 --> 3446.7990000000004
broken I know what that means when it

3443.92 --> 3446.799
looks like that

3447.48 --> 3454.2400000000002
11

3449.799 --> 3458.16
no or maybe yeah maybe that is it could

3454.24 --> 3458.16
be it's a standard size

3459.839 --> 3465.46
teret it's the standard one size up from

3463.76 --> 3467.039
the

3465.46 --> 3471.52
[Music]

3467.039 --> 3471.5200000000004
1080p that one it's very

3473.799 --> 3476.799
typical

3478.51 --> 3481.619
[Music]

3500.2 --> 3506.48
if gas is equ at equilibrium does it

3503.359 --> 3511.119
expand in all directions

3506.48 --> 3514.2
well technically it can't really be at

3511.119 --> 3516.839
equilibrium but the average pressure can

3514.2 --> 3518.72
be at equilibrium the pressure can be in

3516.839 --> 3520.44
equilibrium the gas itself is

3518.72 --> 3523.16
technically within those pressures

3520.44 --> 3523.16
moving in all

3525.16 --> 3529.319
directions right it's a little

3533.72 --> 3536.72
confusing

3538.84 --> 3542.059
[Music]

3543.44 --> 3550.0
so yeah the gas is never at

3546.88 --> 3554.079
equilibrium but the pressure which is

3550.0 --> 3556.24
like the collection of influence of each

3554.079 --> 3561.4
little gas

3556.24 --> 3564.1189999999997
particle the average pressure can be at

3561.4 --> 3567.839
equilibrium a little bit of gas within

3564.119 --> 3571.119
another little bit of gas can become at

3567.839 --> 3574.52
equilibrium with the other gas until it

3571.119 --> 3574.52
eventually all mixes into

3577.4 --> 3583.359
one right or or if you have a balloon

3581.119 --> 3584.599
separating them then it become can

3583.359 --> 3586.48
become an

3584.599 --> 3589.6400000000003
equilibrium with the pressure that

3586.48 --> 3592.359
surrounds it without then eventually

3589.64 --> 3594.5989999999997
mixing in because the balloon keeps it

3592.359 --> 3597.119
separate but the pressure of the balloon

3594.599 --> 3599.52
Bon versus the pressure of the rest that

3597.119 --> 3602.0
surrounds it the air that surrounds it

3599.52 --> 3604.119
that can get at equilibrium with each

3602.0 --> 3606.319
other that doesn't mean that the gas

3604.119 --> 3608.4
that's doing that outside the balloon

3606.319 --> 3610.799
and inside the balloon is actually at

3608.4 --> 3613.0
equilibrium and like stable it isn't

3610.799 --> 3617.88
it's always moving

3613.0 --> 3620.0
always but all that movement and the

3617.88 --> 3624.0
pressure that's a

3620.0 --> 3626.559
result the pressure can become at

3624.0 --> 3626.559
equilibrium

3626.88 --> 3631.1600000000003
a singular gas particle is never at

3635.64 --> 3638.719
[Music]

3647.599 --> 3651.88
equilibrium what is the cause of the gas

3650.6 --> 3657.1189999999997
[Music]

3651.88 --> 3660.079
expense what what it just is that's what

3657.119 --> 3663.44
gas does that's why it is designated a

3660.079 --> 3663.44
gas because that is what it

3663.76 --> 3671.48
does we don't know why gas behaves like

3668.119 --> 3671.48
gas we just know it

3673.319 --> 3680.2
does and that's why we call that gas

3676.44 --> 3683.559
because it shares that behavioral

3680.2 --> 3685.7599999999998
pattern of gas and that's how you know

3683.559 --> 3687.599
hey this is a gas because guess why

3685.76 --> 3690.2400000000002
because it behaves like gas because

3687.599 --> 3691.6800000000003
that's what gas does and that's behavior

3690.24 --> 3694.319
is how we

3691.68 --> 3696.0789999999997
know it's going to do those things

3694.319 --> 3700.52
because it's

3696.079 --> 3702.96
gas we don't know why gas is the gas

3700.52 --> 3705.2
except for well conditional things as in

3702.96 --> 3705.2
like

3705.48 --> 3710.559
oh

3707.079 --> 3713.44
you you you higher the the

3710.559 --> 3715.8390000000004
temperature of a material it's going to

3713.44 --> 3718.839
if it was solid it might might melt

3715.839 --> 3721.839
right and if it was Liquid then it might

3718.839 --> 3726.0789999999997
evaporate and become a gas right that's

3721.839 --> 3731.64
what you can know about it we don't know

3726.079 --> 3735.52
why it does that like why do the states

3731.64 --> 3739.1189999999997
transition why does a liquid turn into a

3735.52 --> 3742.079
gas when you heat it why yeah because

3739.119 --> 3745.039
that's what happens it's just that's how

3742.079 --> 3747.8390000000004
it works why well because that's how it

3745.039 --> 3747.8390000000004
works that's

3749.7 --> 3755.1989999999996
[Music]

3768.52 --> 3771.67
[Music]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
why

3777.92 --> 3783.4
yeah tabok it sounds like you're just a

3780.599 --> 3784.839
belligerent [ __ ] that's trying to

3783.4 --> 3789.319
force your

3784.839 --> 3792.0389999999998
incorrect opinion onto my stream

3789.319 --> 3795.0389999999998
tabok sounds like you're just a

3792.039 --> 3795.039
belligerent

3796.4 --> 3801.52
dick I'm anywhere anywhere close to

3798.96 --> 3801.52
reality

3803.279 --> 3808.24
here

3806.079 --> 3809.319
you think you're funny you're not funny

3808.24 --> 3812.72
you're just

3809.319 --> 3816.16
wrong and packaging your incorrectness

3812.72 --> 3820.64
with stupid little jokes doesn't make it

3816.16 --> 3823.96
real or correct or even funny you're

3820.64 --> 3823.96
just wrong and you're being

3828.88 --> 3836.279
bitrate yeah so funny haha yeah it

3832.279 --> 3836.279
doesn't have mass

3840.24 --> 3844.52
besides if anything and this is going to

3843.16 --> 3847.279
sound

3844.52 --> 3850.799
ridiculous but yeah the gas when that's

3847.279 --> 3855.0
inside here when it's heated guess what

3850.799 --> 3859.0389999999998
yeah it takes away weight cuz it's hot

3855.0 --> 3861.359
gas that's lighter than the not hot gas

3859.039 --> 3865.5200000000004
that's not as hot as your temperature of

3861.359 --> 3867.5589999999997
your body that surrounds you yeah yeah

3865.52 --> 3870.72
and your body is not going to be capable

3867.559 --> 3873.92
of pressurizing it to a level that going

3870.72 --> 3876.72
to be lower density so yeah that gas

3873.92 --> 3879.88
that gas in you actually makes you have

3876.72 --> 3881.5989999999997
less weight [ __ ]

3879.88 --> 3883.839
with

3881.599 --> 3887.039
huh never thought of that with your

3883.839 --> 3889.119
stupid little joke right didn't think of

3887.039 --> 3891.1600000000003
that right because you don't think of

3889.119 --> 3892.559
how things really are you're just here

3891.16 --> 3896.16
to be

3892.559 --> 3900.4
belligerent and repeat repeat like an

3896.16 --> 3903.5589999999997
sjw just repeat the incorrect Lies over

3900.4 --> 3906.64
and over again gas has mass gas has no

3903.559 --> 3909.799
it does not it doesn't have weight and

3906.64 --> 3914.5589999999997
if you have gas inside of you then that

3909.799 --> 3917.92
gas is going to take away your weight

3914.559 --> 3919.8390000000004
because its density on average with the

3917.92 --> 3922.0
temperature and all that in your body

3919.839 --> 3924.7599999999998
it's going to make it less dense than

3922.0 --> 3926.96
the air that surrounds you [ __ ] with so

3924.76 --> 3931.6800000000003
even in your stupid little joke you're

3926.96 --> 3934.68
just wrong you're just

3931.68 --> 3934.68
wrong

3937.039 --> 3943.599
huh just get the [ __ ] out of here

3940.599 --> 3943.599
man

3943.799 --> 3948.279
[ __ ] you're just

3946.079 --> 3950.279
wrong you don't know what the [ __ ]

3948.279 --> 3952.079
you're talking about you don't know what

3950.279 --> 3955.279
the [ __ ] I'm talking about because you

3952.079 --> 3957.96
don't listen and when you try to listen

3955.279 --> 3961.079
it just doesn't work you're just too

3957.96 --> 3963.799
[ __ ] thick so you're just going to

3961.079 --> 3967.3590000000004
reassert your dumbass

3963.799 --> 3968.799
programming that doesn't work with

3967.359 --> 3973.24
what's going

3968.799 --> 3976.24
on yeah like a broken [ __ ] you just do

3973.24 --> 3978.1189999999997
I do that I do that yeah it doesn't work

3976.24 --> 3981.9199999999996
you dumb

3978.119 --> 3984.76
[ __ ] it doesn't work why the [ __ ] you

3981.92 --> 3989.279
think I'm doing this why am talking

3984.76 --> 3992.88
about this for like 5 days in a row cuz

3989.279 --> 3997.52
you're [ __ ] thick and you refuse to

3992.88 --> 3999.039
get it you refuse to get the

3997.52 --> 4001.7599999999998
provable

3999.039 --> 4004.3590000000004
reality of

4001.76 --> 4008.48
substances that you're sitting in and

4004.359 --> 4011.48
how they work you refuse to face the

4008.48 --> 4014.799
reality of the physical

4011.48 --> 4018.599
nature of things yeah

4014.799 --> 4021.64
gas does not have weight you don't

4018.599 --> 4024.799
understand what weight is cuz you're a

4021.64 --> 4027.52
dumb [ __ ] you don't understand there's

4024.799 --> 4034.799
technically three classifications for

4027.52 --> 4040.52
this that are absolutely not the same

4034.799 --> 4040.52
thing yeah they're not the same

4041.88 --> 4048.7200000000003
thing you don't know that

4044.44 --> 4050.799
you're too thick to have that fit inside

4048.72 --> 4053.52
of your head yeah oh all these different

4050.799 --> 4056.0389999999998
things oh they called the same it's very

4053.52 --> 4058.0389999999998
confusing yeah oh it's too hard for you

4056.039 --> 4061.1600000000003
to keep apart so you're just going to

4058.039 --> 4062.6800000000003
shove it all over one one thing you're

4061.16 --> 4066.5589999999997
just going to think it's one thing and

4062.68 --> 4069.279
be a dumb [ __ ] about it yeah you're just

4066.559 --> 4071.8390000000004
going to reduce everything to colloquial

4069.279 --> 4073.559
weight you just think everything is

4071.839 --> 4076.24
colloquial weight everything in your

4073.559 --> 4080.1600000000003
mind just goes down goes boom boom and

4076.24 --> 4082.4399999999996
that's waight and you're a dumb [ __ ] cuz

4080.16 --> 4084.24
that's what you think that's how you

4082.44 --> 4085.48
think and that's how you know you're a

4084.24 --> 4089.64
dumb

4085.48 --> 4092.319
[ __ ] who didn't move beyond the

4089.64 --> 4094.5989999999997
reasoning of sixy

4092.319 --> 4096.92
olds yeah that's that's when you get

4094.599 --> 4100.4800000000005
this kind of thing explained to

4096.92 --> 4104.319
you the Primitive version you never move

4100.48 --> 4106.959999999999
beyond that point you just can't realize

4104.319 --> 4109.2390000000005
what these things actually mean you

4106.96 --> 4113.159
don't understand it even when I explain

4109.239 --> 4115.48
it to you over and over and over again

4113.159 --> 4117.96
you just keep getting it wrong like a

4115.48 --> 4117.959999999999
[ __ ]

4132.799 --> 4140.159
[ __ ] you don't get your [ __ ]

4137.08 --> 4143.839
questions in my chat you [ __ ]

4140.159 --> 4147.2789999999995
retards you can get

4143.839 --> 4149.96
banned I don't want to answer your

4147.279 --> 4153.359
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4149.96 --> 4157.319
questions and I don't want to hear your

4153.359 --> 4160.719
incorrect assertions that you don't back

4157.319 --> 4160.719
up you hear

4161.64 --> 4171.04
me that's right wrath it does gas

4166.52 --> 4173.92
expands in all directions just cause

4171.04 --> 4173.92
that's

4181.479 --> 4189.529
[Music]

4192.719 --> 4195.719
correct

4222.64 --> 4225.64
m

4225.8 --> 4228.56
it's good to be

4251.92 --> 4256.36
loud no no no you can [ __ ] kill

4255.28 --> 4260.5199999999995
yourself

4256.36 --> 4263.159
scumback I don't give you anything you

4260.52 --> 4266.159000000001
just get to [ __ ] kill

4263.159 --> 4266.159
yourself

4267.4 --> 4275.5599999999995
yeah I don't need to give you

4271.84 --> 4278.12
anything I'm going to give you citations

4275.56 --> 4280.52
I'm not going to give you sources I'm

4278.12 --> 4284.8
not going to give you

4280.52 --> 4289.8
anything you can [ __ ] kill yourself

4284.8 --> 4294.0
I'm going to explain things the way they

4289.8 --> 4295.6
work and give you the reasons why things

4294.0 --> 4298.6
work the way they

4295.6 --> 4301.8
work and lay it down every time that is

4298.6 --> 4304.679
my citation yeah the logic The Logical

4301.8 --> 4309.04
structure and the explanations about

4304.679 --> 4311.4400000000005
every aspect of my explanations are part

4309.04 --> 4314.56
of the explanation I don't need to give

4311.44 --> 4319.199
you any [ __ ] citations as

want to get in the way of everybody

4477.92 --> 4480.32
else's

4483.08 --> 4488.679
learning I think

4485.08 --> 4490.5599999999995
people that do that sort of

4488.679 --> 4493.36
thing think they're going to have a

4490.56 --> 4496.080000000001
problem in the future once it's going to

4493.36 --> 4499.5199999999995
become impossible for you to do any of

4496.08 --> 4502.199
this anonymously anymore

4499.52 --> 4506.639
huh what you going to do then when

4502.199 --> 4510.239
suddenly all the people know who you are

4506.639 --> 4512.6
when you act like a [ __ ] [ __ ] huh

4510.239 --> 4516.5199999999995
huh oh

4512.6 --> 4519.8
yeah what you think you could just act

4516.52 --> 4525.1990000000005
like a [ __ ] scumbag like this

4519.8 --> 4525.1990000000005
anonymously forever [ __ ]

4526.12 --> 4530.32
no well those days are going to be

4535.679 --> 4541.4
gone yeah you will be

4538.239 --> 4543.959999999999
identified you will be

4541.4 --> 4547.638999999999
profiled and then

4543.96 --> 4550.0
eventually there will be a program built

4547.639 --> 4552.8
just to

4550.0 --> 4555.0
like lock you up in your own stupid

4552.8 --> 4558.6
little dream so you can just do that

4555.0 --> 4560.679
Fantastical thing in your head stop

4558.6 --> 4563.04
nagging other people with your

4560.679 --> 4567.36
delusional

4563.04 --> 4570.199
retardation yeah so that people can just

4567.36 --> 4575.48
figure things out for themselves and

4570.199 --> 4575.48
stop being indoctrinated by your [ __ ]

4582.12 --> 4585.12
[ __ ]

4585.31 --> 4588.429
[Music]

4601.28 --> 4606.84
dedication even in the holiday period is

4603.36 --> 4609.719
high yeah but because they have no

4606.84 --> 4612.76
life they do this

4609.719 --> 4615.84
because the people they probably do hang

4612.76 --> 4619.0
around with they can't show their

4615.84 --> 4621.52
internal misery to them because as soon

4619.0 --> 4624.44
as they actually show those people who

4621.52 --> 4627.88
they really are those people will

4624.44 --> 4627.879999999999
immediately abandon

4628.92 --> 4634.92
them and they know they know they're

4631.76 --> 4637.4800000000005
[ __ ] they're [ __ ] in life they're

4634.92 --> 4641.159
totally [ __ ] and the only way they can

4637.48 --> 4643.718999999999
get anywhere is by pretending they are

4641.159 --> 4645.679
not who they really are

4643.719 --> 4648.679
that's how they get

4645.679 --> 4650.76
anywhere yeah oh it's going to work out

4648.679 --> 4653.639
great isn't it with the digital

4650.76 --> 4656.6
identification when everybody can know

4653.639 --> 4660.92
exactly who you are

4656.6 --> 4660.92
huh looking forward to

4670.85 --> 4675.0
[Music]

4672.0 --> 4675.0
it

4676.28 --> 4683.639
yeah I have no problem you see cuz I am

4681.08 --> 4686.199
on camera I'm here every day everybody

4683.639 --> 4688.52
knows where I am Everybody Knows My Name

4686.199 --> 4691.239
everybody knows everything about me you

4688.52 --> 4695.92
think I have a [ __ ]

4691.239 --> 4698.239
problem with being known things about me

4695.92 --> 4698.2390000000005
being

4698.88 --> 4703.32
known

4700.52 --> 4708.4800000000005
no but I know a lot of people people

4703.32 --> 4711.96
like you have great amount of difficulty

4708.48 --> 4714.638999999999
dealing with that huh huh I'm looking

4711.96 --> 4714.639
forward to

4720.21 --> 4723.31
[Music]

4731.92 --> 4734.92
it

4747.84 --> 4752.4800000000005
is it repairable the monitor

4752.88 --> 4760.159000000001
no it the repairs would likely be just

4757.12 --> 4763.08
as expensive if it's even possible as

4760.159 --> 4766.5199999999995
like getting a new one or new SE can

4763.08 --> 4766.5199999999995
hand one so

4767.719 --> 4773.92
no I mean when a monitor breaks you're

4770.719 --> 4776.28
[ __ ] cuz to repair it is going to be

4773.92 --> 4776.28
damn

4778.12 --> 4785.199
expensive that must

4781.0 --> 4786.639
hurt no it doesn't hurt it just sucks

4785.199 --> 4790.36
it's just like oh I got to get a new

4786.639 --> 4793.400000000001
monitor oh [ __ ] but no loss I mean

4790.36 --> 4795.799999999999
except for time and

4793.4 --> 4798.638999999999
junk like now I have a monitor that's

4795.8 --> 4800.52
useless and like I have to throw that

4798.639 --> 4803.159000000001
away I

4800.52 --> 4805.84
can't there's more stuff that's like

4803.159 --> 4807.92
piled up downstairs that are like yeah

4805.84 --> 4810.28
we need somebody with a car so we can

4807.92 --> 4814.12
actually transport this to

4810.28 --> 4816.48
the like the garbage delivery thing not

4814.12 --> 4820.239
just a regular trash can you can like

4816.48 --> 4820.239
put a monitor in there that's totally

4821.08 --> 4827.88
irresponsible so yeah it's just yeah I

4824.32 --> 4830.679
got a broken monitor it will remain hurt

4827.88 --> 4833.0
then

4830.679 --> 4835.679
what no

4833.0 --> 4838.12
why I'm not a

4835.679 --> 4841.4400000000005
gamma if something goes wrong I'm not

4838.12 --> 4844.199
going to let that torture me for no damn

4841.44 --> 4846.48
reason it's just a disappointment hey

4844.199 --> 4848.759999999999
welcome to [ __ ] life

4846.48 --> 4851.159
dude if you're going to let

4848.76 --> 4854.280000000001
disappointments drag you down you might

4851.159 --> 4855.96
just freaking end it just like that then

4854.28 --> 4858.4
cuz there's going to be a lot of that in

4855.96 --> 4860.84
life trust

4858.4 --> 4864.0
[Music]

4860.84 --> 4868.2390000000005
me like when you don't get let down

4864.0 --> 4868.239
periodically it literally becomes

4873.76 --> 4878.159000000001
suspicious spring clean up for

4878.96 --> 4883.719
garbages I know I'm not entirely sure

4882.0 --> 4888.12
what that even means

4883.719 --> 4890.52
rich but people in January or February

4888.12 --> 4893.44
do have Tendencies to clean things up I

4890.52 --> 4896.719
mean people have

4893.44 --> 4899.32
impulses I cleaned the whole place up

4896.719 --> 4902.32
pretty much in the last two

4899.32 --> 4906.239
weeks like clean the toilet clean the

4902.32 --> 4908.4
shower clean the the suction system in

4906.239 --> 4910.12
the kitchen like cleaned all the big

4908.4 --> 4913.159
things it's just like yeah now is the

4910.12 --> 4916.239
time why because I have the impulse to

4913.159 --> 4919.08
do it which means I don't have to like

4916.239 --> 4922.239
drag myself into doing something I don't

4919.08 --> 4924.44
like because I want it to do it in that

4922.239 --> 4927.44
moment and that's when I do it and then

4924.44 --> 4931.08
it's a win-win something disgusting gets

4927.44 --> 4933.48
done I didn't mind everybody's happy

4931.08 --> 4933.48
triple

4933.88 --> 4941.04
win and I had the time so why

4937.96 --> 4943.6
not but so we don't really have official

4941.04 --> 4947.159
spring cleaning but I

4943.6 --> 4950.4800000000005
mean people will clean up in January

4947.159 --> 4953.239
because the holidays are over people

4950.48 --> 4953.239
will just do

4954.239 --> 4960.239
that large item no there's no specific

4958.0 --> 4963.08
collection of large jug there is a

4960.239 --> 4966.799999999999
Christmas tree collection though they do

4963.08 --> 4969.5199999999995
do that hello klar good to see you Merry

4966.8 --> 4972.04
Christmas to you too there is like a

4969.52 --> 4975.040000000001
Christmas tree collection thing that

4972.04 --> 4977.199
they do where they go by with a truck by

4975.04 --> 4979.199
and then like collect Christmas trees in

4977.199 --> 4983.759999999999
January they do do

4979.199 --> 4988.638999999999
that but no there's no like oh bring out

4983.76 --> 4988.639
your big garbage or something

4990.44 --> 4994.44
no if you want to get rid of that you're

4992.84 --> 4997.56
going to have to put it in a car

4994.44 --> 5001.0
yourself and then drive it to the the

4997.56 --> 5003.1990000000005
recycling area and then deliver it there

5001.0 --> 5006.12
I mean you could still do that for free

5003.199 --> 5009.44
so it's all good but I mean I can't just

5006.12 --> 5010.719
like carry all that [ __ ] like half a

5009.44 --> 5014.159
kilometer

5010.719 --> 5017.32
away this not doesn't work it's too much

5014.159 --> 5017.32
of it too much heavy

5021.88 --> 5027.4400000000005
stuff do I buy Christmas trees no did I

5025.92 --> 5030.159
do it in my

5027.44 --> 5034.5599999999995
childhood

5030.159 --> 5037.599999999999
yeah but I mean uh uh my

5034.56 --> 5039.76
stepmom was married to my dad like she

5037.6 --> 5041.84
always has like plenty of Christmas

5039.76 --> 5044.2390000000005
stuff he always has a big tree lots of

5041.84 --> 5047.0
decorations it's like an an event every

5044.239 --> 5049.0
year it's way it's like

5047.0 --> 5051.76
spectacular arriving there during

5049.0 --> 5054.08
Christmas like really spectacular it

5051.76 --> 5054.08
really

5054.36 --> 5062.04
is like better Christmas decorations

5058.159 --> 5062.96
than I ever had in my old home with my

5062.04 --> 5064.5199999999995
parents

5062.96 --> 5066.2390000000005
although that was just fine but I mean

5064.52 --> 5068.4800000000005
Christmas wasn't that prominent anyway

5066.239 --> 5070.5199999999995
we were much more into Santa

5068.48 --> 5073.839999999999
Claus C

5070.52 --> 5078.76
class because of their

5073.84 --> 5078.76
presence and all that but

5080.48 --> 5086.239
uh I'm not really a Christmas tree guy I

5084.04 --> 5089.8
don't like the

5086.239 --> 5091.638999999999
idea of killing a tree just for a bunch

5089.8 --> 5093.320000000001
of decoration I think that's terrible I

5091.639 --> 5096.56
think that actually if you're really

5093.32 --> 5100.92
into Christmas you should have a

5096.56 --> 5104.6
Christmas tree in the ground at your

5100.92 --> 5107.92
home at all time and like oh it's

5104.6 --> 5110.679
Christmas let's clean up and decorate

5107.92 --> 5110.679
the Christmas

5113.52 --> 5116.52
tree

5119.08 --> 5124.719
outside I think it's just really mean to

5122.44 --> 5127.0
kill a tree just so you could have it in

5124.719 --> 5127.0
in

5127.6 --> 5131.96
house right that's the only real

5129.92 --> 5134.52
objection I

5131.96 --> 5136.52
have don't they also kill a turkey for

5134.52 --> 5140.4800000000005
Thanksgiving yeah but that's you're

5136.52 --> 5140.4800000000005
going to eat that teret that's the

5147.96 --> 5153.92
point I mean if

5151.119 --> 5155.719
you look look if there was some kind of

5153.92 --> 5158.1990000000005
practical Purpose with the Christmas

5155.719 --> 5159.76
tree like oh yeah when we cut that tree

5158.199 --> 5161.799999999999
the Christmas tree we're also going to

5159.76 --> 5165.56
tap its resin

5161.8 --> 5168.2390000000005
or use it specifically for preparation

5165.56 --> 5170.119000000001
of a fire or something I don't know man

5168.239 --> 5172.718999999999
if there was like if it was more than

5170.119 --> 5174.719
just oh we put a tree in we decorate it

5172.719 --> 5176.88
then it dies and then we just throw it

5174.719 --> 5178.32
out if it was just more than just that

5176.88 --> 5181.400000000001
I'd be fine with

5178.32 --> 5183.5199999999995
it I mean I don't hate people who do

5181.4 --> 5187.0
that with trees I just I don't want to

5183.52 --> 5187.0
do it makes me feel

5188.92 --> 5194.0
guilty like what did that because those

5191.52 --> 5197.639
trees are young like why would you kill

5194.0 --> 5197.639
a young tree like

5203.04 --> 5208.56
that right although hey Christmas tree

5206.28 --> 5210.36
burnings are pretty awesome I agree to

5208.56 --> 5212.92
that it's like yeah you take those dead

5210.36 --> 5215.679
old Christmas trees the put them on a

5212.92 --> 5218.28
heap in a safe place and then light them

5215.679 --> 5220.92
on fire going to smell amazing right

5218.28 --> 5223.48
it's going to smell like the pine smell

5220.92 --> 5227.08
G yeah that is

5223.48 --> 5230.44
awesome I get it

5227.08 --> 5234.08
so in that sense it's pretty cool it can

5230.44 --> 5236.04
be cool but I mean yeah the the first

5234.08 --> 5238.719
time you're going to even do that is

5236.04 --> 5240.6
like during Easter like the Easter fires

5238.719 --> 5242.44
well that's way too far away from

5240.6 --> 5247.92
Christmas like nobody still has that

5242.44 --> 5251.599999999999
tree around so yeah I don't

5247.92 --> 5254.159
know Christmas trees are

5251.6 --> 5257.119000000001
plastic out of the

5254.159 --> 5259.119
box yeah well Kevlar some are there's

5257.119 --> 5261.48
some pretty interesting fake Christmas

5259.119 --> 5263.719
trees like that and hey you can there

5261.48 --> 5267.44
can be great decorations my stepmother

5263.719 --> 5270.08
has some of that too like a Holo tree

5267.44 --> 5271.599999999999
it's not really a tree it's metal but it

5270.08 --> 5274.639
kind of looks like a tree and like

5271.6 --> 5277.2390000000005
there's light that go through

5274.639 --> 5279.159000000001
it so it's like a tree that has

5277.239 --> 5284.119
Christmas

5279.159 --> 5286.08
lights in it it's kind of weird but cute

5284.119 --> 5289.48
so yeah you can make all kinds of props

5286.08 --> 5292.04
and thingies and that's all just fine

5289.48 --> 5294.678999999999
right just don't throw it in the garbage

5292.04 --> 5297.0
at the end of the year you got to store

5294.679 --> 5299.119
that stuff and reuse it that's what my

5297.0 --> 5301.04
stepmom

5299.119 --> 5304.04
does

5301.04 --> 5304.04
so

5308.76 --> 5313.04
yeah so technically I have nothing

5310.28 --> 5318.48
against plastic Christmas trees that's

5313.04 --> 5322.0
going to save the life of several real

5318.48 --> 5322.0
trees then why

5323.28 --> 5327.759999999999
not right but I mean if you're going to

5325.52 --> 5330.1990000000005
have a fake plastic Christmas tree then

5327.76 --> 5334.0
you better damn well keep reusing it

5330.199 --> 5334.0
don't just throw it out

5336.92 --> 5340.28

5525.28 --> 5531.96
media if you're caught lying on

I don't want it to be that bad but

5569.52 --> 5574.360000000001
enough for them to like literally lose

5572.48 --> 5576.718999999999
the notion that they could ever [ __ ]

5574.36 --> 5579.36
pull anything like this again without a

5576.719 --> 5582.08
horrendous death right as long as they

5579.36 --> 5584.639
get to that point mentally I'm fine I

5582.08 --> 5586.8
don't actually have to have them every

5584.639 --> 5590.119
every one of them be torturously killed

5586.8 --> 5595.28
or something as long as that [ __ ]

5590.119 --> 5595.28
fake luciferian confidence leaves them

5595.48 --> 5601.718999999999
forever that the only [ __ ] thing left

5598.28 --> 5604.04
on their mind is like oh how can I get

5601.719 --> 5606.52
get people to forgive me for the

5604.04 --> 5608.719
horrendous things that I done to the

5606.52 --> 5612.1990000000005
point where they're not all going to

5608.719 --> 5614.44
agree to have me killed yeah that's what

5612.199 --> 5617.119
I want these [ __ ] politicians to be

5614.44 --> 5618.36
worried about not about what they can

5617.119 --> 5622.639
get away

5618.36 --> 5622.639
with that's what I want them to

5630.56 --> 5636.080000000001
think

5633.119 --> 5639.92
you need to turn this down

5636.08 --> 5642.4
what wrong idea of what Justice what's

5639.92 --> 5645.08
wrong with

5642.4 --> 5648.48
Justice what you just want a world where

5645.08 --> 5651.719
it's okay to have politicians literally

5648.48 --> 5655.32
like prioritize depopulation

5651.719 --> 5655.32
and use

5655.679 --> 5662.639
excuses to to literally claim to do

5660.52 --> 5664.400000000001
things and then do the exact opposite

5662.639 --> 5666.2390000000005
every single time you think that's okay

5664.4 --> 5669.638999999999
you think that everybody should just lay

5666.239 --> 5671.48
down and accept that that everybody can

5669.639 --> 5674.0
just do exactly the opposite of what

5671.48 --> 5675.839999999999
they say they do and then get away with

5674.0 --> 5678.679
it you think that's okay you think that

5675.84 --> 5680.8
everybody should just be okay with that

5678.679 --> 5683.88
that we should just let that

5680.8 --> 5686.76
happen or should we work up our

5683.88 --> 5689.28
intolerance against that to the point

5686.76 --> 5692.6
where it's actually going to

5689.28 --> 5694.599999999999
stop yeah

5692.6 --> 5699.280000000001
at some point you're going to have to

5694.6 --> 5703.76
start beating the Liars with sticks and

5699.28 --> 5706.0
whips cuz if you don't they don't stop

5703.76 --> 5707.320000000001
lying you're going to have to [ __ ]

5706.0 --> 5709.4
beat

5707.32 --> 5711.88
them and you're going to have to show

5709.4 --> 5714.36
that to other people so that they know

5711.88 --> 5717.36
what happens when you do

5714.36 --> 5717.36
that

5720.4 --> 5723.4

wussy everybody in church should know

that Christ's number one weapon of

5800.0 --> 5808.04
choice is a whip it's in the freaking

5805.119 --> 5811.44
Bible he uses a

5808.04 --> 5813.56
whip now mostly he doesn't use any

5811.44 --> 5816.919999999999
weapon because he's the Prince of Peace

5813.56 --> 5821.639
he knows how to solve things without

5816.92 --> 5824.84
violence but even Christ knew that you

5821.639 --> 5827.6
can't always avoid it forever sometimes

5824.84 --> 5828.84
you must fight sometimes you just can't

5827.6 --> 5831.6
tolerate

5828.84 --> 5838.2390000000005
it and that's when he brings out the

5831.6 --> 5838.2390000000005
whip yeah the whip is Christ's weapon of

5840.199 --> 5843.199
choice

5845.199 --> 5849.638999999999

6097.0 --> 6101.28
on the big

6098.679 --> 6103.59
screen you're not in what are you

6101.28 --> 6106.199
complaining about church

6103.59 --> 6109.84
[Music]

6106.199 --> 6112.839999999999
for that's right akumu you start picking

6109.84 --> 6112.84

decorating a

6137.28 --> 6143.719
church it's not my church what

6141.33 --> 6147.639
[Music]

6143.719 --> 6147.639
who cares is any

6160.76 --> 6164.96
church if your church has a projector

6163.4 --> 6167.638999999999
you can get access to it you should

6164.96 --> 6171.679
definitely like as soon as

6167.639 --> 6173.28
the there some kind of a speech

6171.679 --> 6175.639
and they're talking about how everybody

6173.28 --> 6177.759999999999
has to man up and work harder that's the

6175.639 --> 6179.28
moment where you activate the video and

6177.76 --> 6184.4800000000005
show

6179.28 --> 6184.48
that in the background during the

6192.4 --> 6199.679
speech

6195.239 --> 6202.678999999999

6199.679 --> 6202.679
right

6215.599 --> 6220.1990000000005

6223.719 --> 6229.28
made by a black

6226.0 --> 6232.719

6229.28 --> 6235.0
notice like so that they can't real R

6232.719 --> 6237.92
like oh somebody making fun of the black

6235.0 --> 6240.199

6502.119 --> 6509.759999999999
a little

6504.52 --> 6512.2390000000005
sad just and hey I mean you lost his dad

6509.76 --> 6513.96
man but he's like not complaining about

6512.239 --> 6517.119
it all the time but I could just feel I

6513.96 --> 6517.119
really hope he's going to be all

6523.04 --> 6528.28
right it it does make me feel very lucky

6526.159 --> 6531.5199999999995
that I still have my dad and then he's

6528.28 --> 6533.5599999999995
my dad's doing great I mean the issues

6531.52 --> 6536.96
he's like building up as he's getting

6533.56 --> 6539.76
older are like none of them are actually

6536.96 --> 6542.4
really dangerous they're just little

6539.76 --> 6545.84
nuisances like oh his knees might be

6542.4 --> 6547.839999999999
getting worse right or like his back's

6545.84 --> 6549.88
getting a little bit more stiff and like

6547.84 --> 6553.04
yeah that's a nuisance but none of that

6549.88 --> 6555.92
actually lethal so he's like getting old

6553.04 --> 6557.96
healthily and I'm very happy about that

6555.92 --> 6560.639
and he's still like very spirited and

6557.96 --> 6563.119
and like quick in his in his talking and

6560.639 --> 6566.08
all that so that's all good signs right

6563.119 --> 6569.08
he's not slowing down or

6566.08 --> 6574.119
anything who

6569.08 --> 6579.32
died well Gideon 6 dad I

6574.119 --> 6579.32
guess and ilis G's dad a while

6589.119 --> 6592.119
ago

6594.4 --> 6598.44
yeah that's right get didn't

6618.8 --> 6623.599
sick oh

6620.88 --> 6625.88
okay well sure teret what do you want to

6623.599 --> 6625.88
talk

6649.04 --> 6652.04
about

6671.88 --> 6678.96
what what the

6675.0 --> 6681.96
[ __ ] cutting vegetables

6678.96 --> 6681.96
is

6683.119 --> 6689.199
what the [ __ ] is the point of

6685.4 --> 6694.119
that pretty sure that

6689.199 --> 6694.119
vegetables don't have central nervous

6694.76 --> 6701.320000000001
systems and I mean literally fruits okay

6698.4 --> 6705.5199999999995
fruits not vegetables necessarily fruits

6701.32 --> 6708.599
but fruits are specifically

6705.52 --> 6710.76
designed to be eaten I'm I'm pretty sure

6708.599 --> 6712.639
it's not going to hurt

6710.76 --> 6715.599
it's not going to hurt the fruit to to

6712.639 --> 6718.56
be cut right because

6715.599 --> 6720.52
cutting like you mean teeth like they

6718.56 --> 6723.280000000001
cut in it right it's not going to hurt

6720.52 --> 6726.0
it's specifically designed for that to

6723.28 --> 6728.239
happen it's a kind of a ridiculous thing

6726.0 --> 6728.239
to

6730.679 --> 6736.32
say but I mean I degree that especially

6734.36 --> 6740.5199999999995
like bigger plants

6736.32 --> 6743.679
trees they can actually hurt they

6740.52 --> 6747.52
can it's not the same it's not like with

6743.679 --> 6747.52
the central nerves but they can

6749.719 --> 6754.56
like they can feel damaged

6763.199 --> 6767.36
basically but I mean yeah fruits and

6765.48 --> 6771.0
veget like what the [ __ ] your problem

6767.36 --> 6772.799999999999
man I mean I just want to live okay okay

6771.0 --> 6776.28
I'm not going to worry about if the

6772.8 --> 6779.4800000000005
onion's going to not feel pain as I cut

6776.28 --> 6782.5199999999995
it in blocks like what the [ __ ]

6779.48 --> 6784.36
man you're just getting masochistic at

6782.52 --> 6785.679
that point if you start thinking about

6784.36 --> 6788.44
that kind of

6785.679 --> 6791.04
thing everything has a conscious yeah

6788.44 --> 6793.799999999999
well eat

6791.04 --> 6796.32
me okay everything is a cons yeah that's

6793.8 --> 6798.4800000000005
that's nice I'm still going to eat

6796.32 --> 6800.44
though I'm I'm going to eat it I'm still

6798.48 --> 6801.638999999999
going to have that animal killed so I

6800.44 --> 6805.28
could eat its

6801.639 --> 6807.1990000000005
meat yeah I'm absolutely going to do

6805.28 --> 6810.36
that I'm still going to have like

6807.199 --> 6813.0
thousands and thousands of things killed

6810.36 --> 6816.719
during my lifetime so I could eat them

6813.0 --> 6816.719
yeah I'm absolutely going to do

6818.8 --> 6826.719
that vegetables are in a vegetable State

6821.679 --> 6826.719
that's funny that is funny

6828.28 --> 6833.44
yeah think which had made it up as a

6830.679 --> 6837.079
replied to some vegans I'm sure he

6833.44 --> 6839.598999999999
did it's stupid though I mean it is

6837.079 --> 6841.84
really stupid and hey if you're going to

6839.599 --> 6841.84
go

6842.079 --> 6847.48
there

6844.199 --> 6851.079
minerals yeah minerals have feelings too

6847.48 --> 6853.759999999999
they have a spirit I mean that's like

6851.079 --> 6855.119
even Rudolph Steiner admits that so like

6853.76 --> 6857.159000000001
oh you're you're going to deal with that

6855.119 --> 6859.799999999999
too like if everything has senss what

6857.159 --> 6862.32
are you going to do you're going to go

6859.8 --> 6864.599
try to not hurt the feelings of all

6862.32 --> 6866.32
things because all things have feelings

6864.599 --> 6868.76
and you're just going to like not do

6866.32 --> 6872.5199999999995
anything because you might hurt the

6868.76 --> 6876.679
feelings yeah it's a completely

6872.52 --> 6876.679
pointless consideration totally

6879.079 --> 6884.32
pointless and I mean there's much better

6881.56 --> 6888.96
replies to vegans than oh the you might

6884.32 --> 6891.679
hurt the plant I mean what and just tell

6888.96 --> 6891.679
them how

6892.96 --> 6898.92
industrial crops and all that that

6896.28 --> 6904.44
vegans have to eat that they have a lot

6898.92 --> 6907.92
of death as a side effect a lot of

6904.44 --> 6910.28
rabbits and Vermin and all kinds of

6907.92 --> 6912.119
things and Bug they all die all those

6910.28 --> 6914.639
things have feelings they're provably

6912.119 --> 6918.0
sensient they all die every freaking

6914.639 --> 6922.2390000000005
time so you could have your

6918.0 --> 6924.96
vegetables yeah so there is no food

6922.239 --> 6927.718999999999
without suffering of some kind there it

6924.96 --> 6930.28
doesn't exist there's always something

6927.719 --> 6933.56
going to be suffering

6930.28 --> 6935.04
cuz just by the nature of how it works

6933.56 --> 6936.96
yeah there's a food there's a plenty

6935.04 --> 6939.079
there's going to be competition you

6936.96 --> 6942.199
don't want the competition to like ruin

6939.079 --> 6943.36
it all for you you're going to have to

6942.199 --> 6945.4
deal some

6943.36 --> 6947.5599999999995
suffering you're going to have to stop

6945.4 --> 6949.159
them you're going to have to kill them

6947.56 --> 6952.119000000001
or whatever it is you're going to be

6949.159 --> 6957.92
doing right right cuz that's how it

6952.119 --> 6961.598999999999
works there's no way around it to like

6957.92 --> 6964.8
arrange your life like

6961.599 --> 6967.119000000001
fanatically surrounding the idea that

6964.8 --> 6971.719
you could prevent

6967.119 --> 6974.48
suffering [ __ ] you you arrogant

6971.719 --> 6977.96
[ __ ] [ __ ]

6974.48 --> 6981.48
you what you think you could do that

6977.96 --> 6984.96
dude end yourself

6981.48 --> 6988.959999999999
this life yeah has suffering there will

6984.96 --> 6992.84
be suffering you will suffer yeah you

6988.96 --> 6996.0
can't prevent suffering preventing

6992.84 --> 6999.4800000000005
suffering is actually detrimental in

6996.0 --> 7002.159
many ways yeah how many times does it

6999.48 --> 7005.919999999999
work out when you try to prevent the

7002.159 --> 7008.5199999999995
suffering of an individual or a group

7005.92 --> 7010.639
how many times does that lead the

7008.52 --> 7013.040000000001
prevention of the suffering how many

7010.639 --> 7016.32
times does that lead to them

7013.04 --> 7019.199
improving huh could you give me a couple

7016.32 --> 7020.28
of examples in history where that worked

7019.199 --> 7023.719
out

7020.28 --> 7027.88
huh show me where that worked out the

7023.719 --> 7027.88
prevention of suffering how that help

7032.88 --> 7039.96
them now the only real way you you can

7036.28 --> 7044.28
stop the suffering is by making the

7039.96 --> 7047.92
things that suffer stop the suffering

7044.28 --> 7050.48
they have to stop it they have to stop

7047.92 --> 7053.159
suffering have to stop allowing

7050.48 --> 7057.0
themselves to be subjected to

7053.159 --> 7060.5199999999995
suffering you can't just take suffering

7057.0 --> 7063.48
away there's people and things and

7060.52 --> 7065.96
whatever but mostly people

7063.48 --> 7068.44
that they want the

7065.96 --> 7070.599
suffering doesn't make any sense it

7068.44 --> 7073.879999999999
doesn't have to make any sense to them

7070.599 --> 7076.360000000001
they just do they just want

7073.88 --> 7079.119
it cuz they're

7076.36 --> 7081.4
hooked suffering is addicting too you

7079.119 --> 7083.28
know especially when you feel really

7081.4 --> 7086.0
shitty about yourself and you don't want

7083.28 --> 7086.0
to think about

7090.4 --> 7100.079
it yeah you can't prevent

7093.679 --> 7104.719
suffering but you can show an individual

7100.079 --> 7109.84
how they could choose a more efficient

7104.719 --> 7113.44
route that will naturally avoid

7109.84 --> 7116.32
suffering Avail it so that is just no

7113.44 --> 7116.32
necessity for

7116.4 --> 7123.159
it yeah you could just show better

7119.92 --> 7125.92
ways right but the better ways don't

7123.159 --> 7127.799999999999
destroy the old way just find that

7125.92 --> 7129.4800000000005
better way and if it's better well then

7127.8 --> 7131.639
people will choose the better way and

7129.48 --> 7134.48
not the old

7131.639 --> 7138.92
way right and if it isn't better well

7134.48 --> 7140.919999999999
then time will tell and then people will

7138.92 --> 7144.4400000000005
still choose the old way because time

7140.92 --> 7146.639
has told them that the new way was worse

7144.44 --> 7149.48
yeah that's how it works so hey good

7146.639 --> 7152.639
luck good luck getting the world vegan

7149.48 --> 7156.4
yeah cuz we're going to eat meat cuz it

disgusting it's unhealthy it has all

7167.159 --> 7174.04
this disgusting weird side

7170.239 --> 7175.5599999999995
effects hormonal imbalances it tends to

7174.04 --> 7179.76
cause over

7175.56 --> 7181.76
time yeah it doesn't work it's not a

7179.76 --> 7184.88
replacement we're not going to stop

7181.76 --> 7187.119000000001
eating meat yeah you want animal

7184.88 --> 7190.4400000000005

7214.28 --> 7216.639
doing

7218.159 --> 7221.159
it

7222.96 --> 7226.92
have you ever eaten Indian food you

7224.84 --> 7230.28
would never get tired of it yes we

7226.92 --> 7233.28
absolutely would teret it's going to be

7230.28 --> 7237.92
pretty cool for like two days and then

7233.28 --> 7241.5199999999995
we're going to be very very tired of

7237.92 --> 7241.52
it so

7246.28 --> 7251.119
no no I'll stick to potato

7251.88 --> 7257.36
beet green

7255.079 --> 7261.759999999999
beans buttery

7257.36 --> 7261.759999999999
gravy and a beef sausage

7266.199 --> 7272.32
sorry it works it just works I can eat

7269.92 --> 7276.119
that like every week and not get sick of

7272.32 --> 7279.199
it and I mean every week so I mean you

7276.119 --> 7280.88
could probably eat this Indian

7279.199 --> 7284.919999999999
vegetarian

7280.88 --> 7287.2390000000005
food like every week or every day even

7284.92 --> 7289.079
perhaps and it'll take you like two

7287.239 --> 7290.879999999999
months before you'd actually get sick of

7289.079 --> 7294.799999999999
it and you couldn't eat another

7290.88 --> 7297.76
bite for us no

7294.8 --> 7301.159000000001
no cuz we're not used to eating that

7297.76 --> 7305.400000000001
idian food we're used to eating or I'm

7301.159 --> 7307.28
used to eating Dutch food and some over

7305.4 --> 7308.679
the place it's like a little pasta a

7307.28 --> 7310.679
little classic Dutch with a lot of

7308.679 --> 7312.599
potatoes and

7310.679 --> 7318.119
stuff

7312.599 --> 7320.2390000000005
and that yeah a little Asian sort of and

7318.119 --> 7324.159
that's it that's what I like that's the

7320.239 --> 7328.638999999999
combinations I like that's I won't get

7324.159 --> 7328.638999999999
bored with that with that pette of food

7329.5 --> 7340.96
[Music]

7337.96 --> 7340.96
option

7350.239 --> 7355.079
yes I know teret I

7352.239 --> 7358.119
know I'm sure it's pretty like I've

7355.079 --> 7360.96
eaten Indian food like at certain

7358.119 --> 7363.639
festivals that I went to in Germany

7360.96 --> 7366.56
Gothic Festival there was a stand that

7363.639 --> 7369.119
always had AIC Indian

7366.56 --> 7371.400000000001
food like with rice and stuff and I

7369.119 --> 7373.28
loved it I ate there like almost every

7371.4 --> 7376.159
day I loved

7373.28 --> 7378.599
it but I loved it for a week and then I

7376.159 --> 7380.32
was like yeah that's cool now I don't

7378.599 --> 7382.28
have to eat that for a year and then

7380.32 --> 7384.92
next year I can eat that again for a

7382.28 --> 7386.88
week I love it but I definitely don't

7384.92 --> 7389.28
want to eat that every damn day if you

7386.88 --> 7389.28
know what I

7397.88 --> 7400.88
mean

7402.52 --> 7409.639
cooked half raw

7406.199 --> 7412.4
veggies what's it's what are you talking

7409.639 --> 7415.400000000001
about Europeans definitely don't

7412.4 --> 7415.4
undercook

7415.599 --> 7422.84
vegetables although a lot of like these

7419.04 --> 7425.4
new vegan types they kind of

7422.84 --> 7427.88
do but I mean a lot of vegetables are

7425.4 --> 7430.28
better when they're like not

7427.88 --> 7433.2390000000005
overcooked overcooking tends to like

7430.28 --> 7433.239
kill the the

7438.199 --> 7442.638999999999
vitamins there's thousands of dishes do

7440.559 --> 7445.2390000000005
I get bored eating meat no

7442.639 --> 7446.1990000000005
never but I don't need to eat it every

7445.239 --> 7450.718999999999
day

7446.199 --> 7454.638999999999
though I like the the trade off like one

7450.719 --> 7457.199
day with meat other day no meat then the

7454.639 --> 7459.4800000000005
day meat then no meat that's works the

7457.199 --> 7461.678999999999
best for me

7459.48 --> 7463.36
like if i' actually eat it every day I'd

7461.679 --> 7466.0
start to

7463.36 --> 7468.04
like there's something that builds up

7466.0 --> 7471.679
it's not I don't think it's literally

7468.04 --> 7473.599
healthy to eat it every day but

7471.679 --> 7476.92
regularly

7473.599 --> 7479.32
though I mean when I was much younger

7476.92 --> 7481.4800000000005
like my parents basically like had me

7479.32 --> 7484.36
eating meat every

7481.48 --> 7486.959999999999
day but I don't do that anymore but I

7484.36 --> 7488.839999999999
still like man after one day of not

7486.96 --> 7491.4
eating any meat the next day I'm I'm

7488.84 --> 7494.52
going to be like I need I need

7491.4 --> 7498.36
meat it that's just what what

7494.52 --> 7502.280000000001
happens so I have like meat day non meat

7498.36 --> 7502.28
day meat day non meat

7505.76 --> 7512.719
day I get

7508.28 --> 7513.599
constipation no no that's extremely rare

7512.719 --> 7516.36
for

7513.599 --> 7520.4800000000005
me especially also since I take

7516.36 --> 7523.28
magnesium and all that like that doesn't

7520.48 --> 7524.65
happen I haven't had constipation since

7523.28 --> 7525.96
I like was a

7524.65 --> 7531.36
[Music]

7525.96 --> 7531.36
teen not very typical for me

7534.599 --> 7542.679
anyway and so yeah I mean maybe if I ate

7539.559 --> 7545.639
like insane amounts of meat if I started

7542.679 --> 7549.28
like having an Argentinian meal like

7545.639 --> 7552.36
where it's just mostly me then I might

7549.28 --> 7555.44
get like a weird like my system's going

7552.36 --> 7557.92
to be like oh it's a little much and

7555.44 --> 7561.079
then maybe I'd get constipated but I

7557.92 --> 7562.52
mean I haven't eaten like an Argentinian

7561.079 --> 7565.84
since I was a

7562.52 --> 7570.159000000001
dean I don't really do that

7565.84 --> 7572.88
anymore besides like I now eat organic

7570.159 --> 7575.719
only you're not going really that's

7572.88 --> 7578.32
going to be very

7575.719 --> 7580.2390000000005
pricey to eat like an Argentinian when

7578.32 --> 7583.199
you want do it all organic that's going

7580.239 --> 7583.199
to be freaking

7584.239 --> 7591.199
expensive but I mean even I despite my

7587.84 --> 7594.4400000000005
budget sometimes I get steak and it's

7591.199 --> 7596.719
organic and it is absolutely fantastic

7594.44 --> 7599.5199999999995
and then I eat like two

7596.719 --> 7602.079
meals like not directly after one

7599.52 --> 7604.679
another usually with one or two days in

7602.079 --> 7608.0
between and then I'm like wow that was

7604.679 --> 7611.679
so great some actual steak it's so good

7608.0 --> 7614.04
and it is like so it is unique what it

7611.679 --> 7616.76
gives me like there's some things in my

7614.04 --> 7620.32
body that are like yeah my God

7616.76 --> 7623.2390000000005
finally it really does do that and then

7620.32 --> 7623.239
I'm like good for a

7624.69 --> 7627.75
[Music]

7628.079 --> 7633.679
while you ever got hunting food when I

7631.0 --> 7633.679
was younger

7636.52 --> 7642.280000000001
no well fish I shot a fish one time my

7640.8 --> 7645.4400000000005
parents ate

7642.28 --> 7647.5199999999995
it and after that moment I literally

7645.44 --> 7652.36
never ate fish

7647.52 --> 7656.1990000000005
again I only take fish oil I I don't eat

7652.36 --> 7660.0
it so I went hunting for fish one time I

7656.199 --> 7660.0
guess man I was like

7667.119 --> 7675.28
eight I love being would be cut out if

7670.92 --> 7678.4400000000005
you had to go hunt for your own

7675.28 --> 7681.759999999999
yes well if you just have to hunt it

7678.44 --> 7684.119
it's going to be like periods of meat

7681.76 --> 7686.119000000001
it's like meat meat meat meat meat and

7684.119 --> 7688.558999999999
then it's like oh it's done there's no

7686.119 --> 7691.079
more meat and then you have to like

7688.559 --> 7692.28
survive for a while without it that's

7691.079 --> 7695.0
how it would

7692.28 --> 7698.159
go in

7695.0 --> 7698.96
nature and yeah unless there's a big

7698.159 --> 7701.799999999999
community

7698.96 --> 7704.199
where somebody's always hunting some

7701.8 --> 7707.04
animal and that you can like share it

7704.199 --> 7708.96
with one another and then you can't have

7707.04 --> 7710.28
meat in a more regular basis because

7708.96 --> 7711.4800000000005
somebody's always going to have some

7710.28 --> 7714.0
fresh meat

7711.48 --> 7717.28
somewhere if you want it

7714.0 --> 7721.4
right it's like in a bigger

7717.28 --> 7721.4
community that they can do

7722.559 --> 7728.159000000001
that but like if you're like more

7725.599 --> 7730.04
isolated really in the middle of nowhere

7728.159 --> 7731.638999999999
and you're just a small group yeah it's

7730.04 --> 7734.88
going to be like okay are you going to

7731.639 --> 7734.88
have something that

7734.92 --> 7738.159
period or

7741.199 --> 7745.119
not I mean unless you have like a

7743.48 --> 7747.32
freezer or anything and then you could

7745.119 --> 7750.159
just like sh get a

7747.32 --> 7753.119
deer like quickly chop it up in the

7750.159 --> 7756.159
right way and then fill your freezer and

7753.119 --> 7759.32
you have like food for for

7756.159 --> 7761.719
years for from just one animal so it all

7759.32 --> 7765.679
depends on what you can do with

7761.719 --> 7768.159
it but I mean nothing beats fresh fresh

7765.679 --> 7768.159
kill

7777.159 --> 7782.799999999999
though what meat wouldn't I eat

7780.28 --> 7784.84
octopus yeah I pretty much don't eat

7782.8 --> 7787.320000000001
anything that comes out of a

7784.84 --> 7788.92
sea unless it's

7787.32 --> 7790.32
oil

7788.92 --> 7794.04
so

7790.32 --> 7799.36
it's no octopus no

7794.04 --> 7799.36
squid no fish no

7799.559 --> 7804.0
crabs no

7801.559 --> 7808.96
lobsters pretty much nothing that comes

7804.0 --> 7808.96
out of the sea except for fish

7809.04 --> 7816.239
oil but actually that's not even shrimp

7812.96 --> 7818.88
no shrimp that's right but I will I will

7816.239 --> 7822.5199999999995
take K oil though

7818.88 --> 7826.28
but I'm not going to like eat shrimp

7822.52 --> 7829.079000000001
no so I just eat chicken and beef yeah

7826.28 --> 7833.36
yeah that's right that's that's it it's

7829.079 --> 7835.32
just chicken and beef I don't eat pig I

7833.36 --> 7838.0
don't eat any other type of animal

7835.32 --> 7840.28
really I mean I could I just don't

7838.0 --> 7843.32
really want to like I could perhaps like

7840.28 --> 7845.4
oh they're cooking goose and like okay I

7843.32 --> 7848.4
guess I'll have bit of that but I'd

7845.4 --> 7850.5199999999995
never like choose to like oh I want want

7848.4 --> 7855.28
the goose no I I'll just stick the

7850.52 --> 7855.280000000001
chicken and beef ever had moose

7855.4 --> 7862.5199999999995
no sounds I did I have had deer though

7859.96 --> 7864.04
this very deer tastes very different but

7862.52 --> 7866.88
it's also because deer is always going

7864.04 --> 7870.0
to be wild meat and wild meat tast

7866.88 --> 7870.0
tastes very different

7870.04 --> 7876.44
from from bread meat even when it's

7874.32 --> 7879.44
organic it's organic is a lot better

7876.44 --> 7882.119
than regular but Wild meat is always

7879.44 --> 7882.119
very different

7891.679 --> 7894.679
tasting

7896.0 --> 7901.48
goat I don't like goat I don't like the

7899.92 --> 7904.76
taste of goat

7901.48 --> 7904.759999999999
meat or

7905.52 --> 7909.599
milk I have nothing against them it's

7908.28 --> 7913.759999999999
just

7909.599 --> 7913.76
that I don't know man it's

7915.04 --> 7920.8
weird I kind of like

7918.0 --> 7922.04
goats but I don't like to eat them or

7920.8 --> 7924.599
drink the

7922.04 --> 7926.92
milk I mean I would drink the milk if

7924.599 --> 7928.88
it's like if there was if it was just

7926.92 --> 7931.92
there and raw and there wasn't a lot of

7928.88 --> 7934.559
other options then it's like yeah I just

7931.92 --> 7938.1990000000005
don't like the taste man like everything

7934.559 --> 7941.4400000000005
that's goat like really had that always

7938.199 --> 7944.839999999999
always no matter what has that ghost the

7941.44 --> 7947.799999999999
ghost the goat taste and smell it always

7944.84 --> 7949.599
is there and I can't get used to it I

7947.8 --> 7951.8
just don't like it I've never been able

7949.599 --> 7953.76
to get used to it with sheep too by the

7951.8 --> 7957.400000000001
way I just don't like

7953.76 --> 7959.679
it I don't like the taste of the meat

7957.4 --> 7962.839999999999
and I don't like the taste of the of the

7959.679 --> 7965.28
cheese or the milk I just don't but I

7962.84 --> 7968.8
mean I'm like you're good with that

7965.28 --> 7971.44
awesome I mean it is provably healthy

7968.8 --> 7974.76
goat milk is provably more healthy than

7971.44 --> 7977.199
cow milk especially raw so I'm like yeah

7974.76 --> 7980.2390000000005
do that man I'm all for that it's just I

7977.199 --> 7983.839999999999
don't really like it I just don't like

7980.239 --> 7988.598999999999
it I'll take it if there's nothing else

7983.84 --> 7991.96
but I just don't like it snake oil

7988.599 --> 7995.84
what yeah snake oil

7991.96 --> 7998.639
Works stupid rumors about snake oil

7995.84 --> 8000.719
salesman but I mean you could probably

7998.639 --> 8002.88
sell snake oil and just claim it does

8000.719 --> 8007.92
something else but snake oil does

8002.88 --> 8007.92
actually work what it's made for it's so

8011.639 --> 8017.719
stupid snake sounds like tough meat

8015.0 --> 8021.639
snakes apparently taste just like

8017.719 --> 8024.88
chicken except it is more

8021.639 --> 8029.96
chewy it's harder to

8024.88 --> 8029.96
chew hey LSG good to see you

8031.079 --> 8035.32
have I eaten sneak because I'm

8032.88 --> 8038.2390000000005
Indonesian what I don't think

8035.32 --> 8042.32
Indonesians are particularly snake

8038.239 --> 8047.0
eaters terret I've never heard of

8042.32 --> 8047.0
that I think indones is mostly like

8047.32 --> 8056.719
chickens like most of them most Asians I

8053.48 --> 8058.558999999999
say but yeah no I don't know any snake

8056.719 --> 8060.32
snake eating I don't know about that

8058.559 --> 8062.92
maybe it's a thing there I've never

8060.32 --> 8062.92
heard of it

8067.52 --> 8071.8
though it's getting dark out

8073.52 --> 8077.52
there hope you're all enjoying the

8080.84 --> 8088.719
show what the Chinese eat Komodo I don't

8084.84 --> 8092.96
think anyone eats Komodo

8088.719 --> 8096.559
dragons that would be first off freely

8092.96 --> 8101.0
disgusting I mean komoda dragons are

8096.559 --> 8105.599
like they're predator

8101.0 --> 8109.48
predator reptiles I can't think of any

8105.599 --> 8109.4800000000005
type of meat that could be

8111.119 --> 8117.558999999999
worse I mean Predator meat is already

8114.559 --> 8119.400000000001
freaking disgusting but reptile Predator

8117.559 --> 8122.159000000001
meat I mean come

8119.4 --> 8124.799999999999
on well maybe crocodile but I mean

8122.159 --> 8127.719
crocodile is also just it's just swamp

8124.8 --> 8129.52
chicken from people that eat crocodile

8127.719 --> 8134.559
they just say like yeah it just tastes

8129.52 --> 8137.8
like chicken if you just drown it into a

8134.559 --> 8137.8
swamp it's

8138.44 --> 8144.598999999999
disgusting but you can eat crocodiles

8142.239 --> 8147.919999999999
apparently but I

8144.599 --> 8152.76
mean I wouldn't even try Komodo dragon

8147.92 --> 8155.36
and they're Infamous for being highly

8152.76 --> 8157.119000000001
toxic

8155.36 --> 8159.759999999999
so

8157.119 --> 8163.04
what I don't know steamy traveler not

8159.76 --> 8163.04
that I think I don't think

8164.4 --> 8171.638999999999
so if they have then that's been rooted

8167.599 --> 8171.639
out probably by the Dutch

8171.96 --> 8176.719
colonialism I think it's mostly China

8174.48 --> 8179.04
where they still eat

8176.719 --> 8181.44
dogs

8179.04 --> 8181.44
not the

8185.76 --> 8193.319
islands maybe the beef tongue yeah

8190.239 --> 8196.16
not no I never had

8193.319 --> 8198.76
that no I don't like any of that I don't

8196.16 --> 8198.76
even like

8204.2 --> 8209.319000000001
liver I've seen beef tongue in

8207.24 --> 8210.28
restaurant and it made me want to throw

8209.319 --> 8213.559
up

8210.28 --> 8216.319000000001
just just looks just the look of it is

8213.559 --> 8219.84
so freaking

8216.319 --> 8219.84
disgusting so

8228.359 --> 8234.599
now oh you've talked about how would

8231.479 --> 8237.679
taste like swamp chicken

8234.599 --> 8240.8
yeah I think I've heard that before

8237.679 --> 8240.8
before you told me

8241.08 --> 8248.639
though you just confirmed it for me have

8244.479 --> 8248.639
you ever had turkey yeah of course I

8251.719 --> 8257.639
mean technically in the Netherlands we

8255.16 --> 8261.76
eat turkey during Christmas too it's

8257.639 --> 8264.319
just in my family we kind of stick to to

8261.76 --> 8267.28
chicken because we not we don't have a

8264.319 --> 8268.479
huge family so the turkey would just be

8267.28 --> 8271.2
too much

8268.479 --> 8274.479
much so we kind of stick the chicken but

8271.2 --> 8277.639000000001
yeah turkey is very turkeys are eaten

8274.479 --> 8277.639
here in the Netherlands

8290.399 --> 8298.8
sure

8292.479 --> 8300.76
what ate and working one time she

8298.8 --> 8304.119999999999
what

8300.76 --> 8304.12
the weird

8307.0 --> 8313.04
joke do you think the blood of a fresh

8309.679 --> 8316.719000000001
kill does something to people

8313.04 --> 8320.080000000002
yeah yeah now more than

8316.719 --> 8322.8
that if you like eat the heart of a

8320.08 --> 8325.84
fresh kill or the

8322.8 --> 8328.719
blood but Mo like heart muscle if you

8325.84 --> 8330.960000000001
eat that you actually a lot of people

8328.719 --> 8333.598999999998
have reported to get

8330.96 --> 8336.598999999998
visions of the

8333.599 --> 8338.8
animal where they become the animal they

8336.599 --> 8339.679
like get a memory of what it is to be

8338.8 --> 8342.719
that

8339.679 --> 8345.08
animal that tends to happen if you like

8342.719 --> 8345.08
eat the

8347.96 --> 8354.199999999999
heart it's like you eat a piece of their

8350.359 --> 8354.2
soul and then you dream of

8356.439 --> 8359.439
that

8360.679 --> 8364.24
right it's also that's why the Native

8362.439 --> 8366.679
Americans when they kill a

8364.24 --> 8368.719
buffalo they cut the heart out to take a

8366.679 --> 8371.599
bite it's because of that because they

8368.719 --> 8374.399
then get the the the dream of being that

8371.599 --> 8374.399
Buffalo for a

8384.76 --> 8389.800000000001
bit right that's the funny thing

8387.96 --> 8393.759999999998
you understand that that's what the

8389.8 --> 8396.92
saying comes from eat my heart

8393.76 --> 8398.399
out jealousy why would you eat

8396.92 --> 8401.28
somebody's heart

8398.399 --> 8405.319
out so that you could experience being

8401.28 --> 8407.16
them eat my heart out right you're so

8405.319 --> 8409.92
jealous of that person you would kill

8407.16 --> 8412.52
them and then eat their heart just so

8409.92 --> 8415.960000000001
you could have a glimpse of experiencing

8412.52 --> 8420.319000000001
being them that's why they say eat my

8415.96 --> 8423.399
heart out it's literally what that is

8420.319 --> 8423.399
never thought of that did

8427.12 --> 8433.640000000001
you graveyard of a dead no no teret it

8430.64 --> 8433.64
only works when it's

8434.72 --> 8439.679999999998
fresh when the blood that's going

8437.319 --> 8444.039999999999
through it is still

8439.68 --> 8445.319
living right if if if you kill something

8444.04 --> 8449.68
and you

8445.319 --> 8452.84
like leave it hanging or whatever for

8449.68 --> 8454.880000000001
like like 12 hours or something or eight

8452.84 --> 8457.960000000001
hours then you'll not get any more

8454.88 --> 8460.8
Vision if you take a bite out of it you

8457.96 --> 8464.599999999999
have to do it like very quickly after

8460.8 --> 8466.84
you killed it like right away and then

8464.6 --> 8468.720000000001
that happens if you wait too long you

8466.84 --> 8471.6
don't get anything because it's all dead

8468.72 --> 8474.72
it's like the blood all the organs

8471.6 --> 8478.92
they've all got the message like oh yeah

8474.72 --> 8482.8
we're dead and then the spirit left

8478.92 --> 8486.0
it but if it's still alive if it the

8482.8 --> 8488.599999999999
body doesn't realize it's all dead yet

8486.0 --> 8490.479
it's still just doing its thing locally

8488.6 --> 8493.52
then you can have the

8490.479 --> 8496.599999999999
effect as soon as the body like truly

8493.52 --> 8500.439
got the message that it's dead then it

8496.6 --> 8500.439
the spirit's gone the effect goes

8500.8 --> 8503.8
away

8506.24 --> 8509.199999999999
right

8507.84 --> 8511.16
like cook the food in front of the

8509.2 --> 8513.76
customer in a hot yeah that's very

8511.16 --> 8515.88
Japanese ter they do that in Japan a lot

8513.76 --> 8515.880000000001
I

8517.399 --> 8521.358999999999
think right but I mean if you're going

8520.04 --> 8524.080000000002
to like

8521.359 --> 8525.84
cook the meat doesn't matter how fresh

8524.08 --> 8528.039999999999
doesn't mean if it you just cut it off

8525.84 --> 8530.2
the cow if you're going to like heat it

8528.04 --> 8533.479000000001
up to the point where it's there's no

8530.2 --> 8535.960000000001
more living blood in there you won't

8533.479 --> 8540.8
have the effect it only

8535.96 --> 8540.8
works when it's as

8541.04 --> 8547.880000000001
is as soon as you like treat it you burn

8544.16 --> 8547.88
it or something that effect goes

8566.16 --> 8569.16
away

8569.399 --> 8575.16
what are you talking about

8572.2 --> 8577.560000000001
Derek Spirit left the body while it's

8575.16 --> 8579.88
experiencing the pain does it really

8577.56 --> 8584.439
reset the body what do you mean reset

8579.88 --> 8584.438999999998
the body we're talking about dying

8585.319 --> 8589.92
right I don't get it what are you

8587.6 --> 8589.92
talking

8593.64 --> 8599.08
about eating live crafts h

8600.0 --> 8605.92
that's

8601.88 --> 8605.92
disgusting that's really

8617.56 --> 8624.039999999999
disgusting I mean you got to be like

8620.2 --> 8625.560000000001

8629.359 --> 8635.880000000001
think of a more disgusting thing really

8632.04 --> 8638.880000000001
I just cannot think of a more disgusting

8635.88 --> 8638.88
thing

8642.86 --> 8645.919

8687.6 --> 8692.640000000001
anything slowmo moon buggy okay there's

8690.2 --> 8697.12
no point in my life where I ever didn't

8692.64 --> 8697.119999999999
think crabs were disgusting

8698.92 --> 8703.76
okay I mean I have nothing against crab

8701.72 --> 8706.679999999998
people I have nothing against crabs I

8706.68 --> 8711.76
really don't want to eat

8708.76 --> 8711.76

8715.88 --> 8718.88
okay

8722.84 --> 8727.359
you love Beacon too much oh poor

8727.68 --> 8734.880000000001
AUM biggy taste got

8731.04 --> 8739.92
you are crab eaters

8734.88 --> 8739.92
gay no but they are pretty

8745.88 --> 8752.16
disgusting

8747.88 --> 8755.56
no no I am not DED I specifically will

8752.16 --> 8758.399
not stop eating beef I need beef I've

8755.56 --> 8761.68
tried it I've tried just eating

8758.399 --> 8763.84
chicken uh I'm I will miss a certain

8761.68 --> 8768.08
component

8763.84 --> 8771.64
eventually I can't just do chicken only

8768.08 --> 8775.16
beef is is critical part of my

8771.64 --> 8777.92
diet like I'll fight to the death for

8775.16 --> 8779.76
that diet just so you know

8777.92 --> 8782.439
India ever thinks of like conquering

8779.76 --> 8784.64
Europe or something crazy like that well

8782.439 --> 8788.04
you're going to have a like I will not

8784.64 --> 8790.399
be forced to not eat beef I will not be

8788.04 --> 8790.399000000001
forced

8799.359 --> 8804.56
to so yeah I'm sorry there's just no way

8805.8 --> 8808.8
teret

8814.319 --> 8819.68
right Justice I'm never going to ask you

8816.92 --> 8822.2
to stop eating vegetarian for whatever

8819.68 --> 8825.439
reason like if you want to be vegetarian

8822.2 --> 8829.439
you go ahead you have a religious reason

8825.439 --> 8834.359
to be vegetarian that's cool too but I

8829.439 --> 8836.76
will not be convinced for any reason to

8834.359 --> 8837.880000000001
change my diet especially because of

8836.76 --> 8843.04
some

8837.88 --> 8846.56
religion never ever any

8843.04 --> 8850.399000000001
religion I choose my diet the way I

8846.56 --> 8853.92
choose it and nothing from the outside

8850.399 --> 8853.92
is going to make me change

8861.399 --> 8866.96
that right so if I suddenly choose to

8864.88 --> 8869.479
become vegetarian then that's my my

8866.96 --> 8872.24
choice I would choose that specifically

8869.479 --> 8875.92
because I chose it and not because other

8872.24 --> 8878.199999999999
people told me I had to I had like one

8875.92 --> 8881.24
or two years of eating

8878.2 --> 8883.640000000001
vegetarian is it now 5 years ago it was

8881.24 --> 8885.359
great I led it I love doing that was

8883.64 --> 8889.199999999999
good this what my body

8885.359 --> 8891.0
needed and then I was done and then I

8889.2 --> 8893.359
was done with it because during that

8891.0 --> 8895.359
that whole period every time I smelled

8893.359 --> 8897.2
meat in the street or whatever I got

8895.359 --> 8899.04
sick it's like

8897.2 --> 8901.68
I just didn't want to I didn't want to

8899.04 --> 8904.160000000002
eat it I didn't want meat it felt wrong

8901.68 --> 8905.52
it felt bad it felt like I had to stay

8904.16 --> 8910.52
away from

8905.52 --> 8914.52
it until suddenly i' smell it and be

8910.52 --> 8917.479000000001
like oh wow that changed all of a sudden

8914.52 --> 8919.52
and then I knew like yeah it's over my

8917.479 --> 8922.358999999999
vegetarian period is over I'm going to

8919.52 --> 8925.560000000001
eat meat now and I ate it and it was

8922.359 --> 8925.56
great I loved

8925.6 --> 8934.84
it and most importantly nobody told me

8929.8 --> 8939.479
to do or not to do anything about that I

8934.84 --> 8939.479
did it because I felt like

8941.8 --> 8947.399
it do most people in the nland eat beef

8944.92 --> 8950.399
as regularly as you

8947.399 --> 8950.399
yeah

8955.52 --> 8958.52
plenty

8963.399 --> 8970.0
what I don't know

8966.56 --> 8974.039999999999
teret I'm sorry it's like why would you

8970.0 --> 8974.04
even ask such a question that's

8974.52 --> 8979.560000000001
strange but you can be assured that

8976.96 --> 8983.479
every part of the cow is being

8979.56 --> 8985.24
used for anything there's so much you

8983.479 --> 8987.039999999999
can do with

8985.24 --> 8989.76
it right

8987.04 --> 8993.399000000001
there's no meat lost there's never any

8989.76 --> 8995.84
loss right whatever they keep left over

8993.399 --> 8998.8
they mince it up and they turn it into

8995.84 --> 9001.08
cat food then or dog food like there's

8998.8 --> 9001.08
no

9006.08 --> 9012.12
loss so I don't know I don't know the

9009.04 --> 9014.12
bum I I don't know what part that is I

9012.12 --> 9017.68
don't know what they make what part of

9014.12 --> 9022.68
the beef they make sausages from

9017.68 --> 9025.960000000001
I don't mind it tastes good feels good I

9022.68 --> 9028.16
don't care if they they take a bull's

9025.96 --> 9030.24
penis every time and that's actually

9028.16 --> 9032.92
what they make it I don't care what the

9030.24 --> 9037.0
[ __ ] they make it out of but what they

9032.92 --> 9037.0
make it out of feels just

9043.279 --> 9049.76
fine beef bones are used to make gelatin

9046.12 --> 9052.800000000001
jello yeah sure that's right although

9049.76 --> 9054.6
mostly it's Pig G pig bones that they're

9052.8 --> 9057.72
doing that

9054.6 --> 9062.640000000001
with but yeah beef can be made into bone

9057.72 --> 9062.64

9149.56 --> 9156.519999999999
than it really does with my

9153.0 --> 9156.52
eyes that's kind of

9165.24 --> 9168.24
weird

9168.88 --> 9172.24
right anyway I'm going to round out the

9170.56 --> 9175.88
show soon but first I'm going to take a

9172.24 --> 9175.88
two minute break I'll be right

9195.16 --> 9198.16
back

9255.08 --> 9258.08
e

9285.08 --> 9288.08
for

9289.88 --> 9292.56
okay and I'm

9301.04 --> 9308.080000000002
back some even say they put human flesh

9304.88 --> 9309.119999999999
to yeah well it's not saying teret

9308.08 --> 9311.96
that's

9309.12 --> 9314.560000000001
official that's Pepsi by the way yeah

9311.96 --> 9318.24
Pepsi actually

9314.56 --> 9321.24
uses like fetus

9318.24 --> 9323.279
cells for

9321.24 --> 9326.479
flavoring and yeah that sounds

9323.279 --> 9330.2
completely insane it's official though

9326.479 --> 9334.92
it's official for over a decade huh

9330.2 --> 9337.640000000001
Pepsi if you want to drink baby fetal

9334.92 --> 9340.12
cells like they're not they're not even

9337.64 --> 9341.479
hiding that that's official they still

9340.12 --> 9344.960000000001
do

9341.479 --> 9346.8
it and it's not theories it's

9344.96 --> 9349.88
official

9346.8 --> 9353.399
they admit it they're proud of their

9349.88 --> 9353.399
research that they figured that

9374.92 --> 9377.92
out

9378.2 --> 9384.359
yeah and that's why you should never

9380.68 --> 9386.720000000001
ever drink any kind of sugary fizzy

9384.359 --> 9390.399000000001
drink

9386.72 --> 9394.56
ever right no

9390.399 --> 9397.24
Cola or any other because all those

9394.56 --> 9400.08
things all those companies that do that

9397.24 --> 9401.64
that like any company that's exclusively

9400.08 --> 9405.039999999999
about that type of

9401.64 --> 9406.199999999999
drink like the low quality cheap drink

9405.04 --> 9410.800000000001
that's going to be every everywhere

9406.2 --> 9413.399000000001
mainstream yeah those companies are all

9410.8 --> 9417.278999999999
totally

9413.399 --> 9419.479
evil those companies are focused on

9417.279 --> 9421.0
getting people addicted and they're

9419.479 --> 9424.0
making their lives

9421.0 --> 9426.6
worse cuz that's what that

9424.0 --> 9429.479
does makes your health worse it makes

9426.6 --> 9431.960000000001
your behavior worse you get trouble

9429.479 --> 9436.479
later in

9431.96 --> 9439.399
life diabetes is rampant you can really

9436.479 --> 9442.96
say at this point almost

9439.399 --> 9447.16
exclusively because of sod

9442.96 --> 9448.479
death sugary drinks with fizziness in

9447.16 --> 9452.479
them

9448.479 --> 9454.96
yeah it's probably the number one

9452.479 --> 9459.438999999998
contributor to

9454.96 --> 9459.438999999998
diabetes right even more than

9464.8 --> 9467.8
alcohol

9469.24 --> 9474.279
right and just look at what they did the

9471.399 --> 9478.08
history of these soda companies they're

9474.279 --> 9481.800000000001
all evil they're

9478.08 --> 9484.6
soulless soulless salesmen that'll like

9481.8 --> 9487.599999999999
do business with known war

9484.6 --> 9489.6
criminals advertise for known war

9487.6 --> 9493.479000000001
criminal they don't care they just don't

9489.6 --> 9496.56
care they're they're evil they're there

9493.479 --> 9498.119999999999
to feed off Humanity

9496.56 --> 9500.84
like a

9498.12 --> 9504.52
fungus like they are those people that

9500.84 --> 9506.0
do that are like the candida fungus that

9504.52 --> 9508.52
feeds off the

9506.0 --> 9511.279
sugar so they give Everybody sugar and

9508.52 --> 9513.76
then feed off it feed off those people

9511.279 --> 9517.279
and it doesn't make anybody's life

9513.76 --> 9519.399
better they just think it does for a

9517.279 --> 9523.2
little bit when they're drinking it they

9519.399 --> 9525.278999999999
just think that it oh it's nice yeah but

9523.2 --> 9527.359
they don't know that the price is always

9525.279 --> 9529.84
worse

9527.359 --> 9529.84
you just

9535.64 --> 9542.119999999999
lose so yeah soda companies have all

9538.68 --> 9544.93
been a parasite on

9542.12 --> 9547.999000000002
Humanity huge

9544.93 --> 9547.999
[Music]

9549.0 --> 9553.92
parasite font is Nazi yeah you bet it

9554.64 --> 9557.64
is

9559.359 --> 9563.24
that's

9560.84 --> 9565.84
right I mean they're technically the

9563.24 --> 9568.439
same company it's a Coca-Cola company

9565.84 --> 9571.0
it's just like oh there's another

9568.439 --> 9574.2
there's just their little Nazi Germany

9571.0 --> 9576.359
Branch right they didn't want to not

9574.2 --> 9579.08
sell their soda to the Nazis just

9576.359 --> 9579.08
because they were

9579.84 --> 9582.84
Nazis

9584.64 --> 9587.64
right

9605.319 --> 9610.88
that's make food and huge fats you have

9608.08 --> 9613.56
to worry about rats and stuff

9610.88 --> 9617.24
God yeah thanks for that

9613.56 --> 9619.039999999999
akum yes well with the Coca-Cola though

9617.24 --> 9622.039999999999
you don't really have to worry about

9619.04 --> 9625.6
your big fats because if a rat drops in

9622.04 --> 9628.6
like a Coca-Cola fat you'll never find

9625.6 --> 9633.52
out cu it will completely dissolve into

9628.6 --> 9633.52
it you'll never find any trace of it

9633.8 --> 9639.92
back so yeah there's probably like a

9636.64 --> 9642.76
percentage of dissolved

9639.92 --> 9644.52
rat in the Coca-Cola you're drinking

9642.76 --> 9647.439
it's just a very little amount because

9644.52 --> 9651.640000000001
it's going to be like one R every

9647.439 --> 9654.16
million cubic feet of Coca-Cola or

9651.64 --> 9656.319
whatever but it's going to be in there

9654.16 --> 9660.84
and nobody would have ever

9656.319 --> 9660.84
known cuz you don't find anything

9661.96 --> 9667.599999999999
back it all dissolves in there like I'm

9665.76 --> 9670.16
pretty sure that even the Vats they have

9667.6 --> 9674.319
to put it in must be like really

9670.16 --> 9677.479
weaponized hard to be able to endure

9674.319 --> 9679.278999999999
having Coca-Cola sit in it for that long

9677.479 --> 9681.399
it's going to eat away at the very

9679.279 --> 9684.479000000001
container it's going to be in it's that

9681.399 --> 9688.0
bad so yeah rat dropping in there yeah

9684.479 --> 9688.0
who who would ever find out

9693.72 --> 9700.76
nobody how many unive babies are needed

9697.64 --> 9704.039999999999
for every bottle of Pepsi I don't know

9700.76 --> 9706.56
man I don't know what what the ratio I

9704.04 --> 9708.359
mean it can't be that much

9706.56 --> 9713.039999999999
I mean maybe like

9708.359 --> 9716.479000000001
every can of Pepsi has like two baby

9713.04 --> 9718.160000000002
stem cells in them effectively something

9716.479 --> 9720.84
like

9718.16 --> 9723.6
that it's not going to be much but they

9720.84 --> 9726.08
have put it in

9723.6 --> 9729.12
there it's not like they have like

9726.08 --> 9732.279
hundreds of thousands of baby carcasses

9729.12 --> 9734.84
a day that they can be using to extract

9732.279 --> 9737.479000000001
those stem cells from like they don't

9734.84 --> 9741.64
have enough bodies to even do it that

9737.479 --> 9745.76
much but they manag to find some and

9741.64 --> 9748.68
they use that some little amount it's

9745.76 --> 9751.319
it's unbelievably disgusting and insane

9748.68 --> 9753.84
no matter what anyway so like whether

9751.319 --> 9758.88
they just grind up babies and just shove

9753.84 --> 9762.359
it in a can or they just do a little bit

9758.88 --> 9764.358999999999
does it really matters it's unbelievably

9762.359 --> 9767.359
disgusting either

9764.359 --> 9767.359
way

9780.08 --> 9786.2
I heard they have coped such cells it's

9783.439 --> 9786.2
not yeah it

9787.96 --> 9793.96
is yeah well you can copy a cell if you

9791.439 --> 9796.479000000001
copied it from a human then that still

9793.96 --> 9798.96
means it's a human cell

9796.479 --> 9798.96
cells

9799.88 --> 9804.64
replicate they replicate it and put it

9802.2 --> 9807.84
in drinks well it's not even like they

9804.64 --> 9810.76
put it in the drinks they used it in

9807.84 --> 9814.359
some chemical process there's no living

9810.76 --> 9816.56
cells floating around in your Pepsi okay

9814.359 --> 9820.399000000001
there's no literal living cells that are

9816.56 --> 9823.88
just oh we're just floating around no no

9820.399 --> 9825.64
it's used in the chemical process they

9823.88 --> 9827.88
do something with it just a a bunch of

9825.64 --> 9829.56
stem cells some other stuff and then

9827.88 --> 9832.56
they do something I don't know what the

9829.56 --> 9835.119999999999
hell they do but they they said they do

9832.56 --> 9836.88
that and then the result of that they

9835.12 --> 9840.92
squirt in the drink there's no you're

9836.88 --> 9843.679999999998
not going to find cell debris or living

9840.92 --> 9846.72
stem cells in there okay that's

9843.68 --> 9850.960000000001
nonsense but they admit that they have

9846.72 --> 9850.96
used that for the

9854.2 --> 9861.12
process sin sharing ritual no doubt I

9858.64 --> 9862.88
mean that some somebody had that idea

9861.12 --> 9865.399000000001
and and then said like oh yeah you could

9862.88 --> 9867.599999999999
do that too I'm

9865.399 --> 9871.319
sure I don't

9867.6 --> 9875.56
know whatever you think of it as I'm not

9871.319 --> 9881.039999999999
GNA be drinking Pepsi if you know what I

9875.56 --> 9881.039999999999
mean yeah fedoo can go [ __ ]

9907.12 --> 9909.52
Today's

show some subjects have been pretty

9914.04 --> 9917.080000000002
messed up

9925.92 --> 9929.76
I guess it's been mostly about

9944.08 --> 9947.08
food

9956.88 --> 9963.749
[Music]

9972.25 --> 9977.0
[Music]

9974.0 --> 9977.0
for

9994.14 --> 9997.628999999999
[Music]

10008.399 --> 10016.479
now don't eat craps or no no now never

10014.12 --> 10019.68
just put something like that in the

10016.479 --> 10021.92
title some idiot could read it and then

10019.68 --> 10021.92
do

10023.12 --> 10029.720000000001
it I mean it's like don't eat fees no

10027.84 --> 10030.76
you don't put that in the title it's

10029.72 --> 10033.76
[ __ ]

10030.76 --> 10037.76
up I mean I appreciate the

10033.76 --> 10040.12
attempts but no I never just want don't

10037.76 --> 10042.800000000001

10040.12 --> 10045.399000000001
that in my title yeah I want to say the

10042.8 --> 10047.24
thing that I recommend that you do

people not to do something guess what

10051.04 --> 10056.399000000001
they do they do it so I just only want

10054.0 --> 10058.359
to tell them what to do not just what

10056.399 --> 10060.319
not to do because people then end up

10058.359 --> 10062.640000000001
doing it especially because you told

10060.319 --> 10064.88
them not to and especially because it's

10062.64 --> 10069.519999999999

10282.359 --> 10287.12
special day of the

10284.04 --> 10290.04
year I have a special guest on because a

10287.12 --> 10292.479000000001
special guest happens to come on

10290.04 --> 10294.2
randomly not because of a special day of

10292.479 --> 10298.438999999998
the

10294.2 --> 10298.439
year so that doesn't

10299.359 --> 10306.56
count who knows maybe I will have

10301.56 --> 10306.56

10307.439 --> 10311.279
but I'm certainly not going to have

10308.92 --> 10313.88
somebody on because it's a special day

10311.279 --> 10317.640000000001
of the year just going to have somebody

10313.88 --> 10317.64
on because somebody wants to get

10322.72 --> 10325.72
on

10326.2 --> 10329.2
eash

10332.12 --> 10339.239000000001
okay we could also have talked about

10335.319 --> 10342.84
what should be the ideal way to cook

10339.239 --> 10346.56
stuff well we've talked for almost three

10342.84 --> 10348.8
hours about all the things on how to

10346.56 --> 10350.68
with food and all that without knowing

10348.8 --> 10354.039999999999
how to cook it I don't think we need

10350.68 --> 10355.720000000001
another 10 hours on like oh how do we

10354.04 --> 10357.92
actually cook all

10355.72 --> 10361.76
this

10357.92 --> 10361.76
no you're going to have to

10362.68 --> 10366.439
just dream that

10374.12 --> 10379.960000000001
yourself tumu virus dress up as Santa

10377.88 --> 10383.72
and call me in my

10379.96 --> 10387.319
show well Kuma do you want to do that I

10383.72 --> 10387.319
mean I don't have anything against

10389.96 --> 10397.0
it God D it what are you talking about

10398.2 --> 10405.279
man I don't think anybody does that I

10401.56 --> 10409.359
think like we're not Romans

10405.279 --> 10413.6
here we don't just eat every body part

10409.359 --> 10413.6
we're not Romans or Chinese here

10418.0 --> 10423.359
D we don't just eat random body parts of

10421.64 --> 10426.358999999999
random

10423.359 --> 10426.359
animals

10433.8 --> 10438.039999999999
you're not dressing up ah well then

10435.72 --> 10438.039999999999
never

10438.52 --> 10444.04
mind no I want you to have a Christmas

10441.319 --> 10448.319
hat and a white beard at

10444.04 --> 10448.319000000001
least you can have glasses if you

10452.68 --> 10457.64
want that's your fin no questions

10454.96 --> 10457.64
actually oh

10457.72 --> 10460.72
okay

10462.399 --> 10467.96
gross too much red for me you don't have

10465.12 --> 10470.08
to have an entire suit just a Santa hat

10467.96 --> 10471.64
and a white beard that would be

10470.08 --> 10475.0
great

10471.64 --> 10475.0
glasses gay

10477.399 --> 10480.399
Santa

10481.52 --> 10486.279
what but they're sunglasses

10486.72 --> 10489.72
that he wears at

10492.16 --> 10496.92
night because Santa really only comes

10494.84 --> 10498.2
out at night doesn't he to bring the

10496.92 --> 10503.08
presentence he doesn't do that during

10498.2 --> 10506.479000000001
the day so but yeah uh no the idea of

10503.08 --> 10508.8
glasses is just because it aumu virus if

10506.479 --> 10511.64
he wants to wear glasses with his Santa

10508.8 --> 10511.64
outfit then he

10513.2 --> 10518.52
can because just random that's just

10516.72 --> 10520.358999999999
randomly what I thought of has no

10518.52 --> 10522.92
absolutely no reasons I just thought

10520.359 --> 10524.880000000001
like yeah glasses that's why absolutely

10522.92 --> 10527.72
no reason whatsoever it was completely

10524.88 --> 10530.438999999998
random and is not related to anything

10527.72 --> 10534.08
ever definitely does not need a

10530.439 --> 10537.239
continuing inquiry as to why glasses

10534.08 --> 10537.239
it's just purely

10543.2 --> 10549.12
random does he wear spectacles I don't

10549.2 --> 10555.52
know well he's a very old man and he

10552.2 --> 10559.439
does have reading glasses I think

10555.52 --> 10559.439
so according to the

10569.0 --> 10576.12
legend a monocle that would be hilarious

10572.76 --> 10576.12
Santa Claus with a monocle

10578.479 --> 10584.92
like a Monopoly guy monocle Santa Claus

10582.12 --> 10588.160000000002
with a Monopoly guy monocle that

10584.92 --> 10592.279
that's that's

10588.16 --> 10592.279
interesting to check his list

10601.04 --> 10607.92
twice yeah he knows what you've done he

10604.64 --> 10610.119999999999
can hear you in your sleep he watches

10607.92 --> 10614.239
you when you don't think you're being

10610.12 --> 10616.2
watched yeah Santa is all over it I mean

10614.239 --> 10620.359
who the hell needs Department of

10616.2 --> 10620.359
Homeland Security you could just hire

10630.399 --> 10636.0
Santa Santa always sounded like a green

10657.76 --> 10663.0
that's that's kind of cute sort of I

10660.76 --> 10664.92
guess freaky

10663.0 --> 10667.279
though

10664.92 --> 10667.279
Black

10670.08 --> 10676.6
Santa right well if you want black Santa

10672.68 --> 10678.92
that's cool we want our blackface pets

10676.6 --> 10680.84
yeah and that doesn't mean that oh

10678.92 --> 10682.72
you're black oh you want to be a Pete

10680.84 --> 10685.880000000001
okay then you don't have to have

10682.72 --> 10687.679999999998
blackface then but hey there's still

10685.88 --> 10692.438999999998
plenty of white guys that want to play

10687.68 --> 10694.92
Pete yeah and I want them to have the

10692.439 --> 10697.720000000001
right to put on black face

10694.92 --> 10702.6
I'm serious guys I'm so sick of it I

10697.72 --> 10702.599999999999
want blackace to be like fully

10706.88 --> 10712.08
accepted yeah you can have your damn

10709.359 --> 10714.6
black Santa Claus then we get our black

10712.08 --> 10714.6
face you

10716.08 --> 10720.76
hear that I mean that's a reasonable

10719.12 --> 10725.560000000001
trade

10720.76 --> 10730.2
right because Santa ain't black

10725.56 --> 10734.76
dude yeah no black man is going to live

10730.2 --> 10737.479000000001
and work all year long at the North Pole

10734.76 --> 10740.239
that's

10737.479 --> 10744.88
preposterous Black Santa ain't going to

10740.239 --> 10744.88
go to the North Pole because it's

10745.08 --> 10750.64
cold he's going to get really depressed

10748.359 --> 10752.399000000001
really

10750.64 --> 10756.599999999999
quickly

10752.399 --> 10760.239
yeah so you can have black Santa we get

10756.6 --> 10762.880000000001
black pets we get to keep our black face

10760.239 --> 10762.88
pets

10774.08 --> 10779.6
okay problem black face keeps black

10777.279 --> 10782.720000000001
actors yeah well

10779.6 --> 10784.399000000001
akum I there can be a solution to that

10782.72 --> 10786.76
problem you see

10784.399 --> 10788.278999999999
you can just have black actors that

10786.76 --> 10793.359
don't

10788.279 --> 10796.640000000001
suck that can actually play the role

10793.359 --> 10801.2
properly and then you have to have less

10796.64 --> 10805.599999999999
white actors that have to use black face

10801.2 --> 10808.359
because less black actors that suck

10805.6 --> 10810.439
could take the role because they don't

10808.359 --> 10812.2
suck how about

10810.439 --> 10815.04
that

10812.2 --> 10817.279
yeah you want us to stop using black

10815.04 --> 10818.6
face for our actors then have better

10817.279 --> 10822.12
black

10818.6 --> 10822.12
actors it's that

10828.56 --> 10834.68
simple Samuel L gives a [ __ ] about that

10842.72 --> 10848.92
guy

10844.52 --> 10853.16
Jango and chain oh my God I hate that

10848.92 --> 10853.16
movie I [ __ ] hated

10854.479 --> 10861.88
it Morgan Freeman has an what are you

10857.92 --> 10861.88
talking about Richard

10872.64 --> 10877.8
G

10874.71 --> 10877.8
[Music]

10879.68 --> 10883.279
what are you talking about auma

10892.68 --> 10896.68
virus Morgan is your

10901.359 --> 10907.960000000001
dude Will Smith has L the

10904.96 --> 10907.96
J

10909.04 --> 10912.279
bro who

10917.16 --> 10922.6
cares I mean Will Smith's greatest

10920.279 --> 10925.16
highlight is that he fake slapped

10922.6 --> 10930.16
another black guy on

10925.16 --> 10933.84
stage for some stupid ass virtual signal

10930.16 --> 10936.92
outrage I mean who the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ]

10933.84 --> 10936.92
what M Smith

10962.56 --> 10965.56
does

10968.84 --> 10974.04
yeah snakes on the plane is kind of

10970.279 --> 10976.2
funny though but I mean it's funny not

10974.04 --> 10978.319000000001
because that's what it intended to be

10976.2 --> 10979.68
it's it's just funny because it turned

10978.319 --> 10982.278999999999
out to be really

10979.68 --> 10984.2
silly I mean nobody gave a [ __ ] about

10982.279 --> 10986.479000000001
that movie when they were making it it

10984.2 --> 10989.439
just turned out really funny because it

10986.479 --> 10991.96
just had these silly lines in them and

10989.439 --> 10994.68
because the entire thing is just

10991.96 --> 10997.56
ridiculous as an idea yeah and that's

10994.68 --> 10999.52
what made it funny but I mean if you

10997.56 --> 11001.119999999999
just look at the movie as it is it's

10999.52 --> 11006.640000000001
kind of

11001.12 --> 11006.640000000001
boring it's just dumbass jump scare hor

11007.16 --> 11012.279
[ __ ] snakes I mean I'm sure that Indiana

11010.239 --> 11015.359
Jones shed his pants all the way through

11012.279 --> 11019.319000000001
the movie

11015.359 --> 11019.319
right but nobody else

11022.479 --> 11025.479
did

11043.0 --> 11047.76
Robert Downey Jr was funny on Tropic

11045.239 --> 11050.399
Thunder yeah not only that he actually

11047.76 --> 11050.399
did a good

11051.52 --> 11056.68
performance he played it kind of right

11054.399 --> 11059.0
you there were moments where you would

11056.68 --> 11061.68
actually listen and look at it and just

11059.0 --> 11065.92
think like yeah that's a black man like

11061.68 --> 11069.52
that's impressive dude that is actually

11065.92 --> 11072.359
impressive yeah he did a great

11069.52 --> 11074.720000000001
job right it's it's very easy to play

11072.359 --> 11077.6
that stupid silly little black man or

11074.72 --> 11080.119999999999
whatever but to play like a real like a

11077.6 --> 11082.319
Crusher type black man that's freaking

11080.12 --> 11085.359
difficult man and he did it he did

11082.319 --> 11085.359
actually do that

11096.56 --> 11100.519999999999

11098.2 --> 11102.92
pl yeah I

11100.52 --> 11103.960000000001
