108.399 --> 114.479
show weather today

111.479 --> 114.479
is

114.88 --> 121.83999999999999
clouded with a couple of blue spots in

117.439 --> 121.83999999999999
there hasn't been much sunlight yet

132.4 --> 137.0
clouds are moving up there you could

134.28 --> 137.0
probably see

137.28 --> 141.56
that just looking at the tree and the

140.08 --> 145.28
cloud

141.56 --> 145.28
there you can see it

148.76 --> 151.76
moving

153.239 --> 159.31900000000002
all

154.239 --> 159.31900000000002
right anyway yeah it's a beautiful

159.72 --> 165.76
day it's right now better than it was

162.48 --> 168.2
yesterday most of the day because

165.76 --> 172.07999999999998
yesterday it was like

168.2 --> 174.319
rainy and stormy a lot it's been like

172.08 --> 176.92000000000002
that all evening and all night and kind

174.319 --> 176.92
of drove me

178.76 --> 182.67999999999998
nuts

181.319 --> 185.67999999999998
so I kind of hope it's going to be a

182.68 --> 185.68
little bit less of that

191.599 --> 198.07999999999998
today all right so it's Wednesday the

194.76 --> 198.07999999999998
3rd of January

198.799 --> 206.31900000000002
2024 temperature is probably just same

203.599 --> 206.319
9°

208.68 --> 211.68
cus

213.68 --> 218.31900000000002
right yeah and according to this it's

216.599 --> 220.959
going to keep on like raining and being

218.319 --> 222.439
clouded up until Saturday that's going

220.959 --> 225.159
to clear up but also going to start

222.439 --> 225.159
freezing at

226.68 --> 232.64000000000001
night but with a bit of

230.36 --> 236.28
sun in the

232.64 --> 236.27999999999997
day uh

238.68 --> 241.68
right

244.76 --> 249.32999999999998
see what was I doing yesterday Flat

247.36 --> 250.799
Earth bats is just

249.33 --> 254.239
[Music]

250.799 --> 257.23900000000003
fine Nathan just kept on streaming like

254.239 --> 260.799
all the time though I don't know he was

257.239 --> 264.28
testing something out I think Nathan was

260.799 --> 267.56
attempting to multi

264.28 --> 267.55999999999995
cast on

268.6 --> 274.24
Rumble

270.759 --> 274.24
and there was a little bit of

281.479 --> 286.4
that right but anyway yeah it seems

290.639 --> 296.08
like yeah two streams he tried out two

294.08 --> 297.88
there might be another one I don't know

296.08 --> 300.56
if he's going to continue doing that

297.88 --> 303.44
maybe he wants more testing but

300.56 --> 305.56
Nathan is attempting to also start doing

303.44 --> 309.759
flatter Earth debates on

305.56 --> 309.759
Rumble just to kind of see what that'll

328.479 --> 333.44
do

331.479 --> 336.15999999999997
oh yeah Greg Rees had another amazing

333.44 --> 337.36
video that guy keep I he's like in a

336.16 --> 339.8
round of

337.36 --> 344.0
inspiration because he's like producing

339.8 --> 344.0
a lot of Awesome videos like pretty

344.28 --> 349.84
much last five or something have all

347.24 --> 353.40000000000003
been pretty

349.84 --> 358.0
amazing very esoteric

353.4 --> 361.75899999999996
and digging into distorted history and

358.0 --> 361.759
everything and the blood

361.88 --> 367.039
lines Odd Fellow

364.56 --> 369.88
company weird

367.039 --> 371.08
stuff anyway so is anybody going to show

369.88 --> 374.84
up in the

371.08 --> 377.28
chat I mean I'm late but that makes you

374.84 --> 377.28
even more

383.319 --> 391.40000000000003
late right otherwise I'm just going to

385.479 --> 391.4
start digging in this Illuminati C

395.24 --> 400.8
I wait for people to get in the chat and

398.28 --> 400.79999999999995
start a

404.08 --> 408.08
conversation also I could talk about

406.319 --> 410.36
film that I watched two days ago I

408.08 --> 414.8
didn't talk about it

410.36 --> 418.0
yesterday but the kids movie

414.8 --> 420.40000000000003
Matilda now I originally know the books

418.0 --> 423.44
the best because that's like

420.4 --> 426.56
my mom used to read that to me as a kid

423.44 --> 428.96
I really like the book but the movie

426.56 --> 433.84
when it like came out I was much older I

428.96 --> 436.79999999999995
was like what's this

433.84 --> 438.63899999999995
but I didn't really like it super much

436.8 --> 443.319
maybe it's because

438.639 --> 443.319
just in my fantasy it had been even

443.4 --> 449.75899999999996
better but then like now I'm watching it

447.4 --> 451.23999999999995
I watched it two days ago and I was just

449.759 --> 454.599
watching it

451.24 --> 457.56
like without trying to compare it to

454.599 --> 460.96
anything and I have to say it was

457.56 --> 460.96
actually a really fun

461.24 --> 468.639
movie and like the the main

464.599 --> 471.919
antagonist that that that woman I mean

468.639 --> 476.759
holy [ __ ] that act

471.919 --> 476.75899999999996
like she was so into

477.36 --> 484.639
it must be like one one of the most

480.199 --> 488.56
inspired villain roles ever acted out

484.639 --> 492.199
seriously and it was really really

488.56 --> 492.199
funny I

492.759 --> 498.44
yeah like yeah I don't know I think

496.72 --> 501.15900000000005
Matia is really

498.44 --> 504.44
funny it is really a kids movie but it

501.159 --> 506.8
is just so it does remind me of like

504.44 --> 509.56
what kids think about and what they do

506.8 --> 511.84000000000003
when they're younger and how they see

509.56 --> 514.519
the world and it really does kind of

511.84 --> 517.0799999999999
make sense in that sense it's but it's

514.519 --> 517.08
just so

525.2 --> 532.09
funny like the way that in this movie

529.279 --> 533.4399999999999
and the book too like punishment is

532.09 --> 537.8000000000001
[Music]

533.44 --> 539.7600000000001
like lifted up to or exalted is that the

537.8 --> 542.8389999999999
right word for it it's like

539.76 --> 545.279
transformed into torture just but I mean

542.839 --> 546.7600000000001
for a kid they might actually see it

545.279 --> 549.56
like

546.76 --> 551.959
that when you have like unreasonably

549.56 --> 551.959
strict

555.44 --> 564.0790000000001
teacher right so I don't know

559.44 --> 568.12
hello is anybody there I'm GNA start

564.079 --> 571.12
dropping my freaking link everywhere

568.12 --> 571.12
because

586.44 --> 594.7600000000001
oh man everybody I know is seems to be

591.399 --> 594.76
AFK on

596.72 --> 601.36

599.12 --> 601.36
come

607.44 --> 613.519
here okay whatever I was late anyway so

610.92 --> 615.5999999999999
maybe it's just going to be weird like

613.519 --> 620.44
this

615.6 --> 622.6800000000001
but I mean yeah I can actually just keep

620.44 --> 625.0400000000001
talking even if nobody showed up in the

622.68 --> 628.04
chat for some bizarre

625.04 --> 631.04
reason I'll still just keep

628.04 --> 631.04
going

635.44 --> 642.72
right uh talk about

639.44 --> 645.2
Matia that was fun

642.72 --> 649.0790000000001

by all these trolls over

672.76 --> 676.12
at over at

677.639 --> 680.639

687.959 --> 690.959
joke

and yeah

695.639 --> 702.279
that this criticism on kill Tony which I

699.48 --> 703.6800000000001
totally agree with hey lva Paul good to

729.42 --> 732.49
[Music]

734.12 --> 740.0
right but uh yeah he went on about kill

736.92 --> 743.12
Tony and it's kind of funny because rasa

740.0 --> 744.8
hat some of you might remember him also

743.12 --> 746.24
kind of was into that and he was like

744.8 --> 750.079
telling me Oh you got to see this it's

746.24 --> 751.72
so great but it's like I really didn't

750.079 --> 755.2399999999999
like

751.72 --> 757.72
it like I really didn't like it and it's

755.24 --> 760.36
like okay I I guess that's something

757.72 --> 762.9200000000001
that's like really fits with what you've

760.36 --> 765.6
seen in Life or whatever I didn't like

762.92 --> 768.959
it at

765.6 --> 773.36
all so now to see Owen

768.959 --> 773.3599999999999
basically giving them a

773.56 --> 777.5999999999999
treatment that was just funny to

777.839 --> 780.839
me

783.56 --> 788.3199999999999
uh right anyway that was pretty much

786.48 --> 790.9590000000001
what happened yesterday started watching

788.32 --> 794.12
another series on Netflix but I mean

790.959 --> 796.4799999999999
still very early

794.12 --> 799.48
in the

796.48 --> 799.48
mystery

799.519 --> 803.88
thingy fool me once it's

806.88 --> 814.48
called No spoiler for me if you seen

811.48 --> 816.5600000000001
it you need to look for videos to review

814.48 --> 819.9590000000001
most are horrible yeah but that's the

816.56 --> 821.88
whole thing right lva Paul like oh we

819.959 --> 824.5189999999999
need videos to review oh it has to be

821.88 --> 826.16
good oh so you mean you will be throwing

824.519 --> 829.9590000000001
up at it

826.16 --> 833.519
then cuz that means it's good enough to

829.959 --> 833.5189999999999
revie cuz it's

837.759 --> 840.759
terrible

849.56 --> 854.199
I think we should scout out more wits it

851.839 --> 857.36
hor

854.199 --> 859.8
[ __ ] I really want to go after him in a

857.36 --> 863.36
way not that me personally like oh I'm

859.8 --> 865.24
going to go like no it's just that it is

863.36 --> 868.36
so ridiculous what he's

865.24 --> 871.5600000000001
doing like he needs to like really be

868.36 --> 874.1990000000001
poting out in that sense like you're

871.56 --> 877.5189999999999
[ __ ] it up for every all the flat

874.199 --> 880.959
earth needs to be pointed out really

877.519 --> 882.48
heavy cuz he's not stopping Simon then

880.959 --> 883.88
fight the flatter yeah but they were

882.48 --> 887.12
always horrible and they're never

883.88 --> 887.12
accomplishing anything

887.6 --> 894.72
so except more subs or whatever nobody

891.36 --> 894.72
cares I wonder if it's even

895.8 --> 901.24
real and if they were real people

898.279 --> 903.88
subscri describing to Simon then how

901.24 --> 906.839
real a people are they then right

903.88 --> 909.72
there's this question this dichotomy

906.839 --> 913.32
like are they real subscribers or is it

909.72 --> 916.12
like fake accounts or are they just fake

913.32 --> 919.5600000000001
people right maybe it's just so much

916.12 --> 923.88
because it's fake people people that are

919.56 --> 927.68
real people they're just fake on the

923.88 --> 930.92
inside idiots superficial they don't

927.68 --> 934.2399999999999
they just want a

930.92 --> 936.0
quick a quick excuse to Keep On

934.24 --> 938.5600000000001
Believing

936.0 --> 941.079
nonsense right and there's more of these

938.56 --> 943.4399999999999
people you got to realize that besides

941.079 --> 946.04
people that awaken there's also PE

943.44 --> 948.9200000000001
people that like become

946.04 --> 951.7199999999999
sleepers people that literally like I

948.92 --> 956.639
can't handle the reality in this time so

951.72 --> 956.639
I'm going to go deeper

956.8 --> 962.639
underground that's what I did did when I

959.399 --> 965.319
was younger cuz I got informed in ways

962.639 --> 967.319
about all of this very quickly and it

965.319 --> 969.0
absolutely couldn't handle it because I

967.319 --> 972.92
really need

969.0 --> 975.319
it the world and the leadership to be

972.92 --> 977.36
good was very

975.319 --> 979.5999999999999
terrifying then you can't handle it and

977.36 --> 982.44
then you go back to

979.6 --> 984.519
sleep there's people out there that are

982.44 --> 986.759
literally like yeah Flat Earth is

984.519 --> 990.519
everywhere

986.759 --> 990.519
like but it's still

990.6 --> 996.12
like

992.8 --> 999.24
literally they're so [ __ ] confused

996.12 --> 1001.319
man and yeah those are the fake people

999.24 --> 1004.9590000000001
those are the sleepers that are

1001.319 --> 1007.319
like so used to pulling cheap ass

1004.959 --> 1010.199
trickery to fool themselves about

1007.319 --> 1012.079
reality that they're just completely

1010.199 --> 1015.639
disoriented on the

1012.079 --> 1017.4799999999999
inside and there's whole swaths of those

1015.639 --> 1020.36
types of people out

1017.48 --> 1023.3190000000001
there hards of

1020.36 --> 1025.199
them all people they can't they have

1023.319 --> 1027.52
abandoned reality because they couldn't

1025.199 --> 1027.52
handle

1028.36 --> 1036.12
it like they they are victims to the

1031.079 --> 1036.12
psychological warfare right the overall

1036.919 --> 1040.5590000000002
pressure when the overall pressure it's

1039.12 --> 1041.9589999999998
not like oh you're going to drop out of

1040.559 --> 1044.959
the system because you can't handle the

1041.959 --> 1046.64
pressure no your your mind is going to

1044.959 --> 1048.52
drop out of you because you're not

1046.64 --> 1051.8400000000001
dropping out of the system you want to

1048.52 --> 1054.9189999999999
continue you just throw your mind away

1051.84 --> 1060.8799999999999
to keep going and that's a lot of those

1054.919 --> 1060.88
types of people that follow Simon Dan I

1068.96 --> 1076.44
bet a combination of all

1071.84 --> 1078.9189999999999
three surely yes

1076.44 --> 1081.559
dominoid you kept your points about Wht

1078.919 --> 1086.44
it ignore

1081.559 --> 1089.9189999999999
him but it's it's almost too silly to

1086.44 --> 1093.1200000000001
ignore lva

1089.919 --> 1094.5590000000002
Paul I mean just look at the title from

1093.12 --> 1097.84
my show

1094.559 --> 1101.6
yesterday right I I had to do that it's

1097.84 --> 1106.9599999999998
like yeah wit it literally claims

1101.6 --> 1109.6789999999999
that light can't travel through

1106.96 --> 1111.559
space it has has to travel through

1109.679 --> 1114.919
something and there's nothing there like

1111.559 --> 1117.6
he doesn't understand the concept of

1114.919 --> 1121.76
volume and that things can move through

1117.6 --> 1121.76
volume it it it's so

1123.559 --> 1130.32
bizarre and he he holds on to that he

1127.28 --> 1134.72
keeps holding on to it

1130.32 --> 1137.0
it and that's just one stupid thing one

1134.72 --> 1141.64
of like

1137.0 --> 1143.72
20 10 of which 10 we 10 of those we have

1141.64 --> 1145.3600000000001
not even like discovered yet we haven't

1143.72 --> 1147.08
even gotten to that point but they're

1145.36 --> 1150.0
there I can feel

1147.08 --> 1152.1999999999998
it when you go like

1150.0 --> 1156.08
that like full

1152.2 --> 1159.0800000000002
nutty but a naughty

1156.08 --> 1161.32
consistency there's more it's like a

1159.08 --> 1163.1999999999998
fractal a crazy fractal and there's

1161.32 --> 1167.1589999999999
going to be more

1163.2 --> 1167.159
behind I haven't gotten to

1167.24 --> 1170.24
it

1171.679 --> 1181.3200000000002
does it travel though light

1176.28 --> 1182.3999999999999
no right but there is a supposed speed

1181.32 --> 1185.2
of

1182.4 --> 1188.5590000000002
light that does

1185.2 --> 1191.96
travel but it actually

1188.559 --> 1195.76
doesn't but because of the supposed

1191.96 --> 1198.72
travel of light it's asinine to think

1195.76 --> 1200.44
that light can travel through nothing

1198.72 --> 1204.1200000000001
thing

1200.44 --> 1206.919
right because of the supposed speed of

1204.12 --> 1210.1999999999998
the not actual speed of

1206.919 --> 1211.96
light which requires travel while it has

1210.2 --> 1215.6000000000001
to travel through something still

1211.96 --> 1217.48
remember the socalled speed of light

1215.6 --> 1220.24
right not

1217.48 --> 1221.919
actual but because of the non-actual

1220.24 --> 1223.52
speed of light that you can think of as

1221.919 --> 1226.2
a

1223.52 --> 1230.1589999999999
speed it has to have a medium and it

1226.2 --> 1234.28
can't just be volume so ether yeah I

1230.159 --> 1234.2800000000002
mean that's not convoluted at

1241.64 --> 1247.7990000000002
all how does light have a path if it

1244.32 --> 1247.799
does not travel well it

1248.32 --> 1256.24
has right because of the speed of light

1252.679 --> 1259.64
it will have to have a path right so it

1256.24 --> 1262.36
doesn't have a path it has a path

1259.64 --> 1264.8400000000001
math because it has a

1262.36 --> 1269.1999999999998
speed

1264.84 --> 1273.279
see I'm doing the quot the the

1269.2 --> 1276.72
brackets the quotation marks on

1273.279 --> 1276.72
video for the

1276.84 --> 1280.84
record right because you have the

1279.159 --> 1285.96
so-called speed of

1280.84 --> 1289.9189999999999
light you have the so-called path of

1285.96 --> 1293.72
light and because of the SoCal path of

1289.919 --> 1296.72
light well it would be asinine if that

1293.72 --> 1299.32
path would be through nothing so there

1296.72 --> 1302.52
has to be ether except there is nothing

1299.32 --> 1304.279
it's called evacuated space light just

1302.52 --> 1306.52
moves through nothing it can move

1304.279 --> 1310.72
through air it can move through a

1306.52 --> 1313.48
vacuum right it's not and moving by the

1310.72 --> 1316.1200000000001
way yeah it does move it's just

1313.48 --> 1319.159
instantaneous it's

1316.12 --> 1322.6
just this whole thinking of light as a

1319.159 --> 1324.3200000000002
wave is is like materializing it like

1322.6 --> 1326.84
what do we know

1324.32 --> 1329.279
waves right what do we know our actual

1326.84 --> 1332.4399999999998
waves it's physical

1329.279 --> 1337.4
material that's what we know waves are

1332.44 --> 1342.0
so by thinking of light like waves in

1337.4 --> 1343.919
that mind process you are materializing

1342.0 --> 1346.76
it as a

1343.919 --> 1349.0
thing you start to associate it with

1346.76 --> 1350.679
material Behavior

1349.0 --> 1354.799
but it

1350.679 --> 1357.3200000000002
isn't it's none of that it's light it's

1354.799 --> 1360.4
Unique it's

1357.32 --> 1362.48
instantaneous it doesn't have mass it

1360.4 --> 1366.3200000000002
doesn't have

1362.48 --> 1366.32
speed it's

1368.72 --> 1376.48
amazing yeah and it the light has

1371.48 --> 1379.08
defraction Cascade yeah things defract

1376.48 --> 1382.48
surely but like light is the only thing

1379.08 --> 1385.24
that defract into like multiple

1382.48 --> 1388.48
bands it's very

1385.24 --> 1390.36
unique definitely not as matter anyway

1388.48 --> 1393.1200000000001
I'm going to start chowing on my

1390.36 --> 1397.279
Illuminati Kasa now

1393.12 --> 1397.279
cheers well you can all think about

1398.48 --> 1403.4
that uhoh here we

1406.88 --> 1409.88
go

1415.6 --> 1418.6399999999999
they don't

1423.2 --> 1428.159
dington you can't demonstrate

1430.12 --> 1434.6789999999999
that but I'm sure you can presuppose

1436.88 --> 1439.88
it

1478.32 --> 1486.24
you try to make songs yeah no there's a

1481.679 --> 1486.24
trick to that I'm not making him to

1491.36 --> 1497.0
myself yeah that's right LFA

1494.24 --> 1500.24
po that's a better way of saying it I

1497.0 --> 1500.24
usually just end up

1502.96 --> 1509.32
describing but I mean the trolls will

1505.399 --> 1512.52
always bring out that thing oo laser

1509.32 --> 1515.2
Rangers find range finders use light

1512.52 --> 1515.2
speed no they

1525.08 --> 1531.279
don't I mean show me the electronic that

1528.2 --> 1535.0
can even normally process things like

1531.279 --> 1540.52
speed of light or time intervals that

1535.0 --> 1542.679
would relate to that yeah yeah that's

1540.52 --> 1545.559
unaffordable you can't just have a

1542.679 --> 1548.799
little machine that does something like

1545.559 --> 1551.32
that I mean speeds and intervals that's

1548.799 --> 1553.8799999999999
crazy the type of electronics you'll

1551.32 --> 1553.8799999999999
need for

1556.679 --> 1563.2
that

1558.96 --> 1563.2
right and it's just it's just a

1565.48 --> 1569.039
laser it's very

1569.08 --> 1575.9189999999999
easy to use lasers for like

1573.08 --> 1577.6399999999999
exact location Precision so what are you

1575.919 --> 1580.5200000000002
going to do with these lasers well

1577.64 --> 1582.679
you're going to have two lasers and then

1580.52 --> 1585.799
over distance they're going to be

1582.679 --> 1589.6000000000001
slightly slight like microns closer to

1585.799 --> 1589.6
one another right

1589.919 --> 1597.64
then all you have to do is figure out

1592.559 --> 1597.6399999999999
how what the angle is between those

1597.88 --> 1605.48
lasers and then through that information

1601.48 --> 1608.3600000000001
all kinds of data can be derived can be

1605.48 --> 1612.44
processed yeah there's no speed involved

1608.36 --> 1612.4399999999998
it's all about the angles of the

1616.6 --> 1619.6
lasers

1622.0 --> 1626.76
yes yeah and your facts you don't even

1624.679 --> 1630.72
know what your facts are yeah

1626.76 --> 1633.679
demonstrate [ __ ]

1630.72 --> 1638.279
demonstration yeah your facts are

1633.679 --> 1641.24
outdated we don't use facts anymore yeah

1638.279 --> 1641.24
we moved on to

1646.52 --> 1649.52
email

1660.72 --> 1662.96
and

1676.519 --> 1679.519
scanners

1685.799 --> 1692.6
am I an antia yes I hate

1689.88 --> 1695.6000000000001
faxes

1692.6 --> 1695.6
noisy

1697.6 --> 1703.36
ugly and like when the paper gets stuck

1700.08 --> 1703.36
it's a disaster and all

1704.679 --> 1709.88
that no I don't particularly have any

1707.48 --> 1714.2
anything against fact machines it was

1709.88 --> 1714.2
fun for a while it was a nice

1734.159 --> 1740.3600000000001
trick cat got his Tong no he's just a

1737.12 --> 1743.08
dip [ __ ] that just wanted to insert

1740.36 --> 1746.6789999999999
something don't they don't have points

1743.08 --> 1746.6789999999999
lva Paul you know that

1749.48 --> 1754.799
right anyway hello Lon looks good to see

1752.12 --> 1754.799
you happy New

1759.3 --> 1762.3799999999999
[Music]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
Year

1773.37 --> 1776.9099999999999
[Music]

1796.32 --> 1799.32
that

1806.519 --> 1812.72
yeah so no speeder

1809.12 --> 1814.7199999999998
Light Gas doesn't have

1812.72 --> 1818.72
mass

1814.72 --> 1822.279
um maybe I should just sum it all up all

1818.72 --> 1822.279
the things that you all love so

1826.24 --> 1829.24
much

1852.72 --> 1856.059
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1860.0
um

1858.279 --> 1861.679
it's been a horrendous New Year for me

1860.0 --> 1864.039
oh

1861.679 --> 1867.2
okay

1864.039 --> 1871.2
that's well not

1867.2 --> 1874.3990000000001
good it's been okay for me I mean I had

1871.2 --> 1877.1200000000001
I don't feel I've not I didn't feel

1874.399 --> 1879.1999999999998
great I don't not sure whether it's like

1877.12 --> 1881.9599999999998
the food or that beer that I had or

1879.2 --> 1883.919
something but like it was all cramped up

1881.96 --> 1886.159
it's been cramped up pretty much until

1883.919 --> 1888.519
yesterday still feel it a

1886.159 --> 1890.6000000000001
bit

1888.519 --> 1894.679
but I had thank God I had like a good

1890.6 --> 1897.9189999999999
call with my healer and he like fixed

1894.679 --> 1900.6390000000001
it it's all kind of stuff going

1897.919 --> 1902.5590000000002
on and that's just like going around

1900.639 --> 1905.32
it's like side effect of the ancestral

1902.559 --> 1907.76
winds you can really use powers during

1905.32 --> 1909.639
ancestral winds but yeah you can also

1907.76 --> 1913.76
like get more damage and you can't get

1909.639 --> 1913.76
rid of it somebody else has to do

1914.44 --> 1919.76
that that's the weird thing about it

1917.0 --> 1922.559
with with the healing stuff the the

1919.76 --> 1925.6
technique that I do is

1922.559 --> 1927.72
that you can't heal all of

1925.6 --> 1931.1999999999998
it from

1927.72 --> 1933.48
yourself but you need others to do that

1931.2 --> 1935.32
for

1933.48 --> 1939.679
you

1935.32 --> 1939.6789999999999
sometimes I mean mostly I just do it

1939.919 --> 1946.1200000000001
myself but sometimes you get stuck or

1943.679 --> 1948.5590000000002
whatever or you get a slap and then you

1946.12 --> 1950.399
like you're off guard and then you can't

1948.559 --> 1954.76
get on guard

1950.399 --> 1957.1589999999999
anymore until outside

1954.76 --> 1959.44
intervention you'll just be

1957.159 --> 1962.3200000000002
stumbling like even when I apply the

1959.44 --> 1964.6000000000001
technique then it just doesn't work all

1962.32 --> 1964.6
of a

1966.48 --> 1974.44
sudden until I am

1969.32 --> 1974.4399999999998
assisted back and then I can do it

1976.039 --> 1979.039
again

1991.279 --> 1997.559
what okay y v a what

2005.96 --> 2008.96
that's

2013.039 --> 2020.24
I want to put viruses don't exist in the

2016.559 --> 2022.24
title next to it it would kind of fit

2020.24 --> 2025.0
wouldn't it lle it's just such a

2022.24 --> 2025.0
different type of

2028.519 --> 2033.6
subject I'm still going to do it why

2035.96 --> 2038.96
not

2049.56 --> 2053.0789999999997
yeah now it's a

2054.679 --> 2058.56
Trinity Trinity of spell

2065.879 --> 2068.879
breaking

2075.8 --> 2079.2400000000002
what what the

2086.8 --> 2090.2000000000003
[ __ ] how the

2095.879 --> 2098.879
hell

2100.68 --> 2106.3999999999996
wow that's messed up

2102.48 --> 2110.56
Len really sorry to hear

2106.4 --> 2110.56
that what the [ __ ]

2122.63 --> 2125.739
[Music]

2125.8 --> 2128.8
though

2131.839 --> 2135.96
great kid everything going then

2136.56 --> 2140.44
why why the hell did that

2155.8 --> 2161.1600000000003
happen

2158.68 --> 2163.04
hey dip [ __ ] just dumb [ __ ] adoms

2161.16 --> 2168.96
you're

2163.04 --> 2168.96
out make a point shut the [ __ ] up

2185.72 --> 2188.72
idiot

2214.4 --> 2219.2400000000002
ah yeah that Illuminati C on hit this

2236.319 --> 2242.319
spot wow it's TR it's troll hammering

2244.319 --> 2248.0
day oh the title really trick tried a

2247.119 --> 2251.44
bunch of

2248.0 --> 2254.28
[ __ ] it's time to kick him out come

2251.44 --> 2256.2000000000003
on there [ __ ] Show Yourself show how

2254.28 --> 2259.3590000000004
[ __ ] you

2256.2 --> 2259.359
are come

2275.599 --> 2278.599
on

2294.0 --> 2297.8
hey Woodwork and guny bear good to see

2298.04 --> 2302.56
you the king [ __ ] has

2300.92 --> 2305.52
R

2302.56 --> 2308.52
LS I don't see it that

2305.52 --> 2308.52
way

2322.359 --> 2325.64
hey Richie G good to see

2335.52 --> 2338.52
you

2340.28 --> 2345.88
right I'm going to turn on my coffee I'm

2342.8 --> 2345.88
kind of looking forward to

2350.96 --> 2359.839
that you're one and only royal title

2355.24 --> 2359.839
King [ __ ] is your royal title

2360.44 --> 2365.2400000000002
okay you're in a funny mood today

2362.96 --> 2368.44
woodworking guny bear anyway we'll be

2365.24 --> 2368.4399999999996
right back

2420.599 --> 2423.8
oh in boot camp

2425.359 --> 2428.359
okay

2456.079 --> 2458.319
h

2474.76 --> 2479.8
right I'm really going to try to do my

2477.56 --> 2479.7999999999997
best

2480.56 --> 2485.2799999999997
to get to bed earlier although like with

2483.64 --> 2488.4
the storms and everything it's like a

2485.28 --> 2492.2000000000003
real hassle going to

2488.4 --> 2494.8
bed cuz it just keeps waking you up like

2492.2 --> 2498.24
sudden pressure waves and all

2494.8 --> 2498.2400000000002
that but

2500.48 --> 2506.839
uh yeah I've not been the most focused

2503.88 --> 2509.44
since since the new year compared to

2506.839 --> 2511.7999999999997
like right before that I really want to

2509.44 --> 2512.76
get back maybe it's just not me it's

2511.8 --> 2515.1600000000003
like

2512.76 --> 2517.96
everybody maybe it's not me maybe it's

2515.16 --> 2521.319
everybody else

2517.96 --> 2524.68
but I'm saying that not because of like

2521.319 --> 2526.92
my empathy so right I ride on the energy

2524.68 --> 2530.68
that's already

2526.92 --> 2533.28
there now right before the new year

2530.68 --> 2536.68
there's a lot of energy build

2533.28 --> 2540.6400000000003
up then with

2536.68 --> 2544.44
everybody it gets kind of tense

2540.64 --> 2546.2799999999997
even then after there's like a release

2544.44 --> 2549.359
and a bit of a depletion and I think

2546.28 --> 2552.8
think I'm like having issues with that

2549.359 --> 2555.92
part cuz I was like enjoying basically

2552.8 --> 2558.0
all the the energy fruits from everybody

2555.92 --> 2559.48
is like whoa look at what I got what I

2558.0 --> 2563.559
can do now with all

2559.48 --> 2567.28
this everybody's having that by the

2563.559 --> 2572.4
way Owen was noticing it too and all

2567.28 --> 2574.6800000000003
that but now it's like it's

2572.4 --> 2577.44
discharged so now it just feels more

2574.68 --> 2581.5989999999997
like ah there's nothing to latch on

2577.44 --> 2585.4
to nothing to work with right

2581.599 --> 2587.319
now PTSD from all the barely would work

2585.4 --> 2590.64
and guny bear we're Dutch people we

2587.319 --> 2590.64
don't get traumatized from

2605.079 --> 2609.7200000000003
fireworks yeah that that's only the

2607.52 --> 2612.04
freaking War torn

2609.72 --> 2614.72
migrants they might freak out over

2612.04 --> 2616.68
firework they might go nuts or something

2614.72 --> 2620.0
we

2616.68 --> 2620.0
don't we're

2633.96 --> 2638.079
Dutch oh I got coffee

2640.92 --> 2646.52
right so there you go I got an excuse

2643.119 --> 2650.1600000000003
for being low energy it's all your

2646.52 --> 2653.68
fault you guys don't have the Christmas

2650.16 --> 2658.0
energy anymore damn it now I can't tap

2653.68 --> 2660.0
into that n just kidding I mean that is

2658.0 --> 2662.359
effectively what I think is going on a

2660.0 --> 2665.0
bit what do I mean I can't blame you I

2662.359 --> 2668.0
mean you're just part of

2665.0 --> 2668.0
it

2668.359 --> 2673.2
and we'll get back to it it's all about

2670.04 --> 2673.2
getting the subjects

2674.319 --> 2677.5589999999997
together keep

2679.0 --> 2685.16
building and to be fair like in the

2681.359 --> 2687.7599999999998
night I do get a lot of vision

2685.16 --> 2689.72
stuff it's just in the morning when I

2687.76 --> 2692.28
wake up it's all

2689.72 --> 2694.5989999999997
gone maybe any somebody else has that

2692.28 --> 2697.96
too but like in the night I am having

2694.599 --> 2697.96
all kinds of vision stuff

2701.48 --> 2706.72
like Dark World related ideas some of

2704.359 --> 2709.7599999999998
them really creepy like some of them are

2706.72 --> 2711.839
like hellish memories of like through

2709.76 --> 2713.96
when suddenly like because I talk back

2711.839 --> 2716.96
right it's like oh 80 years in

2713.96 --> 2719.359
hell yeah but I don't like describe the

2716.96 --> 2722.0
exact details right I kind of avoid that

2719.359 --> 2724.88
on purpose because it's fixed I just the

2722.0 --> 2727.319
tension of it alone it's

2724.88 --> 2729.2400000000002
maddening

2727.319 --> 2733.64
but

2729.24 --> 2735.5589999999997
sometimes I like remember a fine detail

2733.64 --> 2739.16
about that experience and it's like I'm

2735.559 --> 2742.3190000000004
in my spirit body back just going

2739.16 --> 2745.44
through that trying to like not lose my

2742.319 --> 2747.8
mind like I have like a PTSD memory from

2745.44 --> 2750.8
a dark World Experience almost and that

2747.8 --> 2753.8
happens sometimes a

2750.8 --> 2757.44
bit it's been happening a

2753.8 --> 2760.8390000000004
bit but it's like like a test to see how

2757.44 --> 2763.64
strong I am if I get demoralized from it

2760.839 --> 2767.2
and I'm not getting demoralized from it

2763.64 --> 2772.52
but it is having a strain on my

2767.2 --> 2774.5989999999997
body but I'm not destabilizing

2772.52 --> 2778.28
morally partially thanks to the

2774.599 --> 2780.28
technique I'd say so like yeah it's it's

2778.28 --> 2783.079
interesting to me what's

2780.28 --> 2786.079
happening like oh I don't feel well

2783.079 --> 2789.0
today is like an entire astrological

2786.079 --> 2791.44
event to me pretty much what you can tie

2789.0 --> 2791.44
in with

2791.76 --> 2795.28
that in this

2804.44 --> 2809.52
period you fought in the Korean oh yeah

2807.16 --> 2809.52
okay

2811.839 --> 2818.24
well oh didn't have

2814.48 --> 2818.2400000000002
PTSD well not not from

2820.48 --> 2826.559
fireworks you know why that is woodwork

2822.92 --> 2829.76
gy bear it's because kids do like

2826.559 --> 2832.559
firework [ __ ] as a little as a little

2829.76 --> 2835.96
boys girls usually don't do

2832.559 --> 2839.6400000000003
that and I think it actually

2835.96 --> 2843.28
helps because it makes you used to

2839.64 --> 2846.04
just it's almost like a mini War you see

2843.28 --> 2849.8390000000004
for the kids go around you check

2846.04 --> 2851.72
everything and you just use explosives

2849.839 --> 2855.16
all the

2851.72 --> 2857.7599999999998
time and because of

2855.16 --> 2859.319
that if you then land in a war and

2857.76 --> 2861.88
something like that happens with real

2859.319 --> 2864.96
explosion like people blow up around you

2861.88 --> 2867.1600000000003
it's almost like less shocking because

2864.96 --> 2871.64
as a kid you've been through a

2867.16 --> 2875.5589999999997
simulation almost of that so your spirit

2871.64 --> 2876.92
is already ready for the format even

2875.559 --> 2879.8
though though the things actually happen

2876.92 --> 2881.48
are still super [ __ ] up right but your

2879.8 --> 2884.76
spirit is prepared and then you don't

2881.48 --> 2886.839
get as much PTSD

2884.76 --> 2889.119
damage it might have something to do

2886.839 --> 2889.119
with the

2890.76 --> 2895.4
fireworks to me as a little little boy

2893.4 --> 2897.52
it was like fireworks is almost like

2895.4 --> 2901.359
military training to me it's like I want

2897.52 --> 2904.64
this this like ah fireworks going around

2901.359 --> 2907.2799999999997
and testing

2904.64 --> 2909.72
people with fireworks see if they scared

2907.28 --> 2911.96
of fireworks and see how much they dare

2909.72 --> 2911.9599999999996
to

2922.68 --> 2928.0
do now you're keeping your Christmas

2925.0 --> 2928.0
tree up yeah why

2931.16 --> 2938.0789999999997
not you should probably keep it up

2934.599 --> 2939.48
until like after the what is it second

2938.079 --> 2941.96
week of

2939.48 --> 2944.16
January was the first no the first week

2941.96 --> 2944.16
of

2950.0 --> 2955.24
January all right I'm going to get my

2952.0 --> 2955.24
coffee be right

2964.52 --> 2967.52
back

3024.44 --> 3027.44
h

3037.76 --> 3040.8390000000004
hey Tommy good to see

3042.4 --> 3048.319
you we nobody wears wooden shoes

3045.92 --> 3052.2400000000002

3048.319 --> 3054.72
people say that like nobody does that

3052.24 --> 3058.9599999999996
like freaking Farmers don't even do that

3054.72 --> 3060.64
anymore it's like a a handful of really

3058.96 --> 3062.599
oldfashioned

3060.64 --> 3063.5989999999997
Farmers I don't know if they're even

3062.599 --> 3067.4
there

3063.599 --> 3068.88
still they might have like passed away I

3067.4 --> 3071.64
don't

3068.88 --> 3072.7200000000003
know like that's old Generation stuff

3071.64 --> 3075.839
man

3072.72 --> 3078.2
like nobody in freaking Netherland wears

3075.839 --> 3078.2
wooden

3084.359 --> 3087.359
shoes

3087.88 --> 3091.7200000000003
only a couple of farmers may may be

3090.24 --> 3093.4799999999996
doing that maybe they want to be

3091.72 --> 3097.52
oldfashioned or something

3093.48 --> 3101.52
but like nobody else does that

3097.52 --> 3104.7599999999998
cuz they suck walking in those things

3101.52 --> 3104.7599999999998
sucks it

3107.48 --> 3114.88
hurts sell them to the idiot tourist yes

3111.319 --> 3117.96
absolutely I mean it's a piece of wood

3114.88 --> 3120.319
tourist like oh s yeah it's a piece of

3117.96 --> 3120.319
wood

3120.88 --> 3125.92
man you know what you use them for to

3123.319 --> 3128.72
walk in the mud is that what you want to

3125.92 --> 3132.88
do you want to use those to walk in the

3128.72 --> 3136.1189999999997
mud or it's like walking in the mud not

3132.88 --> 3139.079
really a thing you like to do as a

3136.119 --> 3141.359
tourist right it's ridiculous all of it

3139.079 --> 3141.3590000000004
it's

3144.28 --> 3147.28
ridiculous

3174.24 --> 3177.24
what

3177.599 --> 3181.119
my

3178.64 --> 3185.24
God

3181.119 --> 3187.96
why I mean it's like a joke wooden

3185.24 --> 3189.68
shoes I mean it's literally a joke who

3187.96 --> 3192.52
the hell does

3189.68 --> 3194.0
that I guess it's the Dutch that do it's

3192.52 --> 3197.4
just so

3194.0 --> 3199.799
stupid why is that so freaking why why

3197.4 --> 3199.799
wooden

3204.16 --> 3207.16
shoes

3210.64 --> 3215.92
I

3211.52 --> 3215.92
mean we got like rubber

3216.839 --> 3221.839
boots like wooden shoes don't even get

3220.04 --> 3226.2
you through deep

3221.839 --> 3229.04
mud okay it's

3226.2 --> 3233.319
stupid like wouldn't Sho how you can

3229.04 --> 3236.5589999999997
like go to like maybe 10 cm of

3233.319 --> 3239.2
mud with wooden shoes yeah what the

3236.559 --> 3241.8390000000004
point if it's further yeah it's all over

3239.2 --> 3243.72
you you're covered in mud now and you

3241.839 --> 3246.24
can't get your wooden shoes out anymore

3243.72 --> 3250.5589999999997
because it's covered in mud what's the

3246.24 --> 3250.5589999999997
point just use rubber

3251.0 --> 3256.559
boots you can have those that are like

3253.359 --> 3259.839
rubber boot pants so you can go get into

3256.559 --> 3262.3190000000004
like a meter of mud without any

3259.839 --> 3267.0789999999997
issues without getting it in

3262.319 --> 3267.079
you why wouldn't choose

3269.28 --> 3272.92
I think it's like a almost like

3271.0 --> 3276.799
propaganda I think wooden shoes are

3272.92 --> 3276.799
almost like nonsense

3278.52 --> 3285.16
propaganda but Humpty Dumpty as uh Matt

3283.319 --> 3286.88
from Quantum of conscious would say it

3285.16 --> 3288.68
it's like a nonsense thing it's like oh

3286.88 --> 3289.799
it's the Dutch identity wooden shoes

3288.68 --> 3291.3999999999996
like

3289.799 --> 3293.68
why

3291.4 --> 3296.2000000000003
why it's so

3293.68 --> 3300.44
stupid like we got the best farmers in

3296.2 --> 3303.2799999999997
the world pretty much right they don't

3300.44 --> 3305.64
use wooden shoes

3303.28 --> 3308.0
okay they really

3305.64 --> 3310.72
don't it's

3308.0 --> 3312.24
stupid maybe some of them are like super

3310.72 --> 3315.64
old fashioned they're like almost

3312.24 --> 3317.52
larpers role players of oldfashioned

3315.64 --> 3320.52
Dutch for me and maybe they would wear

3317.52 --> 3322.839
wooden shoes but like w you

3320.52 --> 3325.359
know like those are not like the

3322.839 --> 3326.92

3380.92 --> 3388.039
video that was given to me

3386.72 --> 3390.4399999999996
by Adam

3388.039 --> 3394.119
mein

3390.44 --> 3397.28
Christian history about the arianism and

3394.119 --> 3400.079
the Council of NAA it was interesting as

3397.28 --> 3403.039
a research piece but I've gotten ideas

3400.079 --> 3406.3590000000004
with it like it it shank forth certain

3403.039 --> 3408.0
ideas that are like kind of creep me out

3406.359 --> 3409.64
but yeah you want to look into some

3408.0 --> 3413.599
research

3409.64 --> 3416.48
piece of Christianity Council of NAA

what that was details of it the guy in

3416.48 --> 3421.0
this video like done some pretty good

3418.92 --> 3424.6800000000003
research on

3421.0 --> 3424.68
that if you're into

3425.72 --> 3430.52
that it's basically about the

3428.119 --> 3433.52
establishment of the Trinity

3430.52 --> 3433.52
details

3435.0 --> 3441.68
it's that channel is awesome yeah I

3443.799 --> 3446.799
know

3462.64 --> 3469.319
H oh

3464.76 --> 3472.2400000000002
okay cool oh good to hear Richard G yeah

3469.319 --> 3476.119
it's definitely worth it I watched

3472.24 --> 3478.7599999999998
it yesterday also it's not super long

3476.119 --> 3480.6800000000003
but it is very informative and I've

3478.76 --> 3482.96
gotten these ideas I kind of want to

3480.68 --> 3484.9199999999996
talk with Adam about it I did mention it

3482.96 --> 3489.16
in

3484.92 --> 3490.52
Skype about these the Thousand Years

3489.16 --> 3493.7599999999998
that were

3490.52 --> 3497.64
inserted remember the Thousand Years of

3493.76 --> 3501.119
false history between Christ and our

3497.64 --> 3505.0
time like where and when and how what is

3501.119 --> 3508.079
the consequences of that like I'm I want

3505.0 --> 3512.0
to like recreate what exactly happened

3508.079 --> 3516.4
and it's it's kind of scary to realize

3512.0 --> 3519.319
that yeah think about it because of this

3516.4 --> 3519.319
Thousand Years

3520.2 --> 3526.64
insert a couple of things happened

3522.799 --> 3530.599
around that time huge Transformations

3526.64 --> 3534.799
happened very quickly after each other

3530.599 --> 3535.6800000000003
and then they invented a thousand years

3534.799 --> 3539.0
to

3535.68 --> 3542.839
solidify the end result and stretch it

3539.0 --> 3546.28
up like it all took a lot of time in

3542.839 --> 3549.68
reality it all happened very quickly

3546.28 --> 3553.2000000000003
yeah from the Roman

3549.68 --> 3557.96
Empire to the Catholic

3553.2 --> 3561.0789999999997
Church yeah and then the Renaissance it

3557.96 --> 3563.2
happened very quickly after each other

3561.079 --> 3566.119
there was no freaking thousand year

3563.2 --> 3569.16
Christian medieval be

3566.119 --> 3572.4
[ __ ] they invented

3569.16 --> 3576.0
that the Catholic church just

3572.4 --> 3577.92
existed it was just there and then they

3576.0 --> 3580.319
just literally try to mind control

3577.92 --> 3583.4
everybody with this Rewritten

3580.319 --> 3586.839
history about how they've been in power

3583.4 --> 3588.4
a thousand years it's a crazy mind game

3586.839 --> 3592.599
when you think about it that's really

3588.4 --> 3596.64
what happen and I'm trying to puzzle it

3592.599 --> 3596.6400000000003
together just realizing like

3596.88 --> 3603.2400000000002
a lot of these Catholic priests these

3599.559 --> 3606.3590000000004
early priests from the Roman Empire

3603.24 --> 3611.16
would have been like like Generations

3606.359 --> 3613.24
just dedicated to inventing history in

3611.16 --> 3615.92
like writing the history trying to make

3613.24 --> 3617.2799999999997
it fit to create those thousand years

3615.92 --> 3619.799
for the

3617.28 --> 3623.2400000000002
church and make it legit and that is

3619.799 --> 3623.24
like that's the stuff we

3623.559 --> 3628.039
learn

3625.359 --> 3630.24
that's the stuff we learn in

3628.039 --> 3633.76
school but

3630.24 --> 3633.7599999999998
like how do

3634.359 --> 3639.44
you how do you all put it in its place

3637.079 --> 3643.0
how do you put it how can you back

3639.44 --> 3646.64
engineer this and get it

3643.0 --> 3650.119
right to really figure out when what

3646.64 --> 3652.64
happened and what certain like what

3650.119 --> 3656.52
information is created and like how did

3652.64 --> 3656.52
they create it

3660.799 --> 3666.799
and maybe even who like who were the

3663.2 --> 3670.4399999999996
people that wrote all of this this

3666.799 --> 3673.92
thousand years in

3670.44 --> 3673.92
between who was

3676.24 --> 3683.24
that is there any

3678.799 --> 3685.48
record of the assembly process because

3683.24 --> 3689.3999999999996
this can't just be one guy must have

3685.48 --> 3691.96
been a massive organized effort right

3689.4 --> 3696.119
almost like a council of NAA yeah I

3691.96 --> 3696.119
think the counil of NAA is complete

3696.44 --> 3705.16
fiction I said it I think it's complete

3699.4 --> 3705.1600000000003
fiction I think it is an early process

3705.839 --> 3711.52
thing when the Romans basically like

3708.72 --> 3713.5589999999997
decided no we are Christianity now we're

3711.52 --> 3716.0
assimilating this and then they created

3713.559 --> 3718.3590000000004
a thousand years of how they transformed

3716.0 --> 3721.359
into Christian and became the Catholic

3718.359 --> 3723.68
church when they basically click clack

3721.359 --> 3725.799
they just decided oh no we're not a

3723.68 --> 3726.7599999999998
Roman Empire anymore we're the Catholic

3725.799 --> 3731.24
church

3726.76 --> 3733.5200000000004
now very quickly very very quickly that

3731.24 --> 3733.52
that

3734.44 --> 3738.96
happened

3736.48 --> 3741.559
right dropped the helmet dropped the

3738.96 --> 3745.48
shield dropped the body armor put on the

3741.559 --> 3747.6800000000003
cloak shaved the head oh here's the book

3745.48 --> 3750.76
and suddenly it's the Catholic Church

3747.68 --> 3750.7599999999998
like very

3757.319 --> 3763.079
quickly the guy who talked about history

3759.64 --> 3765.0789999999997
of FL yeah woodwor g be definitely

3763.079 --> 3767.8390000000004
better than

3765.079 --> 3770.799
that I'm just thinking about these

3767.839 --> 3772.4
realizations right we figure out these

3770.799 --> 3774.88
things about how things have been

3772.4 --> 3777.52
constructed and changed I'm trying to to

3774.88 --> 3781.599
like back engineer like what it was

3777.52 --> 3785.48
really like and this is one thing the

3781.599 --> 3789.88
transition from the Roman Empire with an

3785.48 --> 3793.96
emperor and the Senate and all that to

3789.88 --> 3795.4
becoming a church all of a sudden I

3793.96 --> 3798.079
think that whole process of

3795.4 --> 3801.52
transformation went like dazzlingly

3798.079 --> 3803.6800000000003
quickly over just a few

3801.52 --> 3806.92
generations and then they like

3803.68 --> 3808.9199999999996
immediately just created mind control

3806.92 --> 3812.76
systems that and

3808.92 --> 3812.76
then went around the

3814.079 --> 3818.7200000000003
world and re like insert that that

3817.039 --> 3821.2000000000003
rewrote history it must have been the

3818.72 --> 3822.3999999999996
Vatican that has done that specifically

3821.2 --> 3824.96
the history

3822.4 --> 3826.279
insert I wonder if if they still have

3824.96 --> 3828.039
like their records of what really

3826.279 --> 3831.16
happened and then how they assembled

3828.039 --> 3833.559
this fake history to insert would be

3831.16 --> 3836.48
amazing to even have a record of that

3833.559 --> 3836.48
and and to keep keep

3838.2 --> 3842.64
it but they went around the world

3840.48 --> 3844.559
changed everything right all the Jesuits

3842.64 --> 3847.799
went around the world changed the the

3844.559 --> 3851.8390000000004
shape of the earth maybe but definitely

3847.799 --> 3854.24
the calendar stuff definitely history

3851.839 --> 3857.0389999999998
right they must have gone around

3854.24 --> 3859.5589999999997
specifically to ensure that all the

3857.039 --> 3861.3190000000004
cultures around the world would insert

3859.559 --> 3864.88
that thousand

3861.319 --> 3866.319
years and then some didn't

3864.88 --> 3869.1600000000003
ah

3866.319 --> 3873.44
ah like

3869.16 --> 3876.319
Islam they didn't do that and so they

3873.44 --> 3879.88
say no no it's just right

3876.319 --> 3882.96
there they're lying they're Satan yeah

3879.88 --> 3884.7200000000003
yeah no you're the [ __ ] Satanist yeah

3882.96 --> 3886.92
you're the

3884.72 --> 3889.64
Antichrist Catholic

3886.92 --> 3892.88
Church you're the

3889.64 --> 3895.799
Beast we know you

3892.88 --> 3897.88
are you invented a thousand years and

3895.799 --> 3900.799
tried to force that upon everybody and

3897.88 --> 3903.76
then literally like gen tried to

3900.799 --> 3905.359
genocide entire Regents just because

3903.76 --> 3907.92
they wouldn't do

3905.359 --> 3910.7599999999998
that because they held on to the truth

3907.92 --> 3913.64
because you are the

3910.76 --> 3916.599
Antichrist Catholic Church

3913.64 --> 3919.8799999999997
Romans yeah you're just the Romans to me

3916.599 --> 3923.119
it's not that that long ago yeah you

3919.88 --> 3927.2000000000003
didn't have a thousand years to to like

3923.119 --> 3929.559
lay down the dirty war Pagan

3927.2 --> 3933.68
tactics to just become all good

3929.559 --> 3939.4
Christians no no you literally invented

3933.68 --> 3939.3999999999996
those thousand years yeah I know you

3945.52 --> 3948.52
did

3952.039 --> 3957.599
ah inity is divine by mass volume yeah

3955.799 --> 3962.359
well you can't put it on the scale

3957.599 --> 3966.599
though yeah it's not susceptible by

3962.359 --> 3968.16
momentum the only sense in which gas has

3966.599 --> 3971.4
that

3968.16 --> 3974.319
mass which is not a thing to have in the

3971.4 --> 3977.2400000000002
first instance right it's a derived

3974.319 --> 3981.839
concept from the density the only sense

3977.24 --> 3984.4799999999996
it has it in is well gas presses gas

3981.839 --> 3987.52
presses that's what it does in that

3984.48 --> 3992.48
sense that's where the mass comes from

3987.52 --> 3995.119
any form of force related thing or

3992.48 --> 3997.52
attribute that gas has it's going to be

3995.119 --> 4000.52
from it

3997.52 --> 4002.96
pressing going down go boom boom Mass

4000.52 --> 4005.2
definitely not it never goes down go

4002.96 --> 4005.2
boom

4005.48 --> 4011.44
boom I'm confusing weight with mass yeah

4008.72 --> 4011.4399999999996
no not

4013.0 --> 4016.0
really

4018.52 --> 4021.079
no not

4026.24 --> 4033.24
really yeah mass is not a

4029.559 --> 4033.2400000000002
thing they nice

4035.96 --> 4041.2
indeed

4038.279 --> 4043.279
yeah I'd say wait i' just like to say

4041.2 --> 4045.319
Mass because it's pretty much the same

4043.279 --> 4047.4
thing

4045.319 --> 4050.44
yeah there's very little to distinguish

4047.4 --> 4050.44
between mass and

4052.24 --> 4056.9599999999996
weight although weight has different

4055.0 --> 4058.839
implications because now you're dealing

4056.96 --> 4061.079
with the convention of weight mass is

4058.839 --> 4064.0789999999997
merely a

4061.079 --> 4064.079
derived

4065.0 --> 4070.079
system but weight is an entire

4072.68 --> 4078.319
convention wa entirely different oh

4075.0 --> 4078.319
really explain to me

4102.839 --> 4105.839
how

4106.719 --> 4112.12
no it's not [ __ ] weight is not a

4109.6 --> 4112.120000000001
force

4117.279 --> 4123.159000000001
factor scalar value you're talking about

4125.6 --> 4129.279
mole this is all

4132.799 --> 4135.799
wrong

4147.159 --> 4150.879999999999
I don't understand what that is okay

4149.319 --> 4152.679
well that's your time to get the [ __ ]

4150.88 --> 4156.679
out

4152.679 --> 4158.64
[ __ ] yeah go go waste your time

4156.679 --> 4160.56
writing comments on the shows where I

4158.64 --> 4161.6
actually dedicate the entire show to

4160.56 --> 4165.719
