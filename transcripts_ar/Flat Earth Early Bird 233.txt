36.28 --> 44.42
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.25 --> 46.1
early-bird number 233 I'm your host

44.42 --> 48.11
Arwen and before we start the show

46.1 --> 50.989000000000004
please don't forget to share it on any

48.11 --> 52.879
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

50.989 --> 54.68
already subscribed to my channel and hit

52.879 --> 56.57

54.68 --> 58.489
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

56.57 --> 61.309
p.m. Amsterdam time every day

58.489 --> 65.28999999999999
please also support me through super

61.309 --> 68.09
chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe

65.29 --> 72.58000000000001
that would be much appreciated so the

68.09 --> 75.92
weather today is a little bit different

72.58 --> 79.85
maybe I should have expected this it's

75.92 --> 81.799
Wednesday which means pay per day and

79.85 --> 87.74
then for some reason it always likes to

81.799 --> 91.72
go and rain although apparently it it

87.74 --> 98.33
always does remain dry exactly when I go

91.72 --> 102.14
but yeah for all that beautiful summer

98.33 --> 105.25999999999999
weather today is kind of cloudy and it's

102.14 --> 106.93
a lot fresher you know I get the feeling

105.26 --> 113.02000000000001
there's going to be rain at some point

106.93 --> 115.95
but oh well it's good

113.02 --> 115.95
it's all good

121.7 --> 131.3
so how you guys are doing mm-hmm some

128.459 --> 131.3
monkey 3d

134.379 --> 148.89999999999998
Steve Oprah McCool that yellow boy James

143.15 --> 153.56
Mason yeah good to see you guys earlier

148.9 --> 161.019
yeah I had a very typical conversation

153.56 --> 163.489
with Daniel and I just got sick of it

161.019 --> 165.47
he's just starting to feel more and more

163.489 --> 167.93
like a real mental patient and not

165.47 --> 170.87
somebody is that's even attempting to

167.93 --> 176.15
get out of their dream because he just

170.87 --> 178.489
refused to hear the demand of actual

176.15 --> 182.72
physical evidence he kept on referring

178.489 --> 186.31900000000002
to some papers and more theoretical

182.72 --> 188.299
reasoning pieces all outside of the

186.319 --> 192.349
physical realm and it's just I couldn't

188.299 --> 195.799
bear it anymore and he was spamming so I

192.349 --> 197.569
just told him look if you think you can

195.799 --> 200.9
prove gas pressure without a container

197.569 --> 204.47
prove that that law of thermodynamics is

200.9 --> 208.84900000000002
wrong as we apply it then go on the

204.47 --> 212.93
freakin debates and face John and

208.849 --> 215.959
present it and yeah Daniels probably not

212.93 --> 219.53
gonna do it because these yeah he's

215.959 --> 222.53
either too shy or afraid or he's just

219.53 --> 225.049
not able to handle himself was already

222.53 --> 226.88
shown signs of that so but it's not

225.049 --> 229.15
gonna be his problem because I don't

226.88 --> 233.209
want to deal with this [ __ ] anymore I

229.15 --> 236.48000000000002
don't want to nurse his delusion his

233.209 --> 240.019
escapism delusion anymore because that's

236.48 --> 241.94
what it's come down to it's no longer

240.019 --> 245.9
entertaining possibilities it's

241.94 --> 250.389
literally going deeper into the

245.9 --> 254.48000000000002
presuppositional dream in order to avoid

250.389 --> 258.769
confrontation escapism and I can't stand

254.48 --> 260.799
that [ __ ] that that that really wears me

258.769 --> 260.799
down

261.41 --> 272.699
escape is amiss bad and he wasn't doing

269.669 --> 274.31899999999996
it offensively that's the difference

272.699 --> 277.349
though like people like Brenda for

274.319 --> 279.93
example they are in psychological

277.349 --> 283.5
warfare absolutely so they will do

279.93 --> 285.87
whatever they can in any situation in

283.5 --> 289.02
order to win and they don't care if

285.87 --> 293.25
they're right or not Daniel does but

289.02 --> 298.139
he's just addicted to the globe dream to

293.25 --> 301.5
that to that realm that is created for

298.139 --> 304.47
the yeah for people's minds for their

301.5 --> 308.039
fantasy to latch onto and to dig into

304.47 --> 311.34000000000003
that reasoning structure to occupy the

308.039 --> 316.8
mind if it's something to do to distract

311.34 --> 320.15
it keep you busy occupational therapy

316.8 --> 328.02000000000004
that's what it obviously is the Daniel

320.15 --> 332.669
and he can't stop it hey Thank You

328.02 --> 334.10999999999996
Jeremy Bennett for the forty $99 a super

332.669 --> 337.77
jet donation Wow

334.11 --> 340.22900000000004
much appreciated ok good day Arwen

337.77 --> 342.84
thanks for replying to me earlier in

340.229 --> 346.65
scriptures light was made before the Sun

342.84 --> 348.599
and thoughts on that Regenesis again

346.65 --> 353.909
made me think on stuff you said about

348.599 --> 356.25
light just a thought Wow huh

353.909 --> 358.639
that kind of stuff gives me the shivers

356.25 --> 358.639
because

360.169 --> 369.59
as I've said before I don't really even

364.36 --> 376.039
read the scriptures but I do it kind of

369.59 --> 377.479
with a purpose because yeah I do every

376.039 --> 381.08
time I get confronted with it it's

377.479 --> 383.029
always amazing but I'm afraid that in

381.08 --> 387.25899999999996
the way that I'm doing things that I'm

383.029 --> 391.4
letting things come up in my mind

387.259 --> 394.46000000000004
naturally I can't drown myself in the

391.4 --> 396.5
Bible because I would I'd lose the I

394.46 --> 398.12
then start to also reference

396.5 --> 400.759
everything's in the Bible I'm afraid of

398.12 --> 403.61
that kind of stuff and I want to just

400.759 --> 409.099
commit to the frequency to the the idea

403.61 --> 412.159
of the path of Christ and to just wield

409.099 --> 416.389
that like a second language on top of

412.159 --> 418.819
normal language and make it into a

416.389 --> 422.199
discipline not a reflection of a

418.819 --> 425.18
specific book because you can find

422.199 --> 428.24
elements like that in anything it's all

425.18 --> 431.719
about recognizing what frequency it is

428.24 --> 434.12
where it will lead to what's the

431.719 --> 438.439
foundation of it what's driving it all

434.12 --> 441.74
that that is really what I I focus on

438.439 --> 446.689
the most in my personal religion that

441.74 --> 450.009
the path as my path as a nique as an

446.689 --> 450.009
eclectic Christian

450.52 --> 456.90999999999997
ah anyway yeah that's a real nice start

454.87 --> 460.389
up for the morning thanks so much for

456.91 --> 463.389
that Jeremy Bennett and it is

460.389 --> 466.72
interesting that light apparently was

463.389 --> 468.669
there before the Sun that makes sense on

466.72 --> 471.03900000000004
many in many ways that's very

468.669 --> 474.60999999999996
interesting if that is written if that

471.039 --> 478.63
really is true I'd love to see that like

474.61 --> 481.21000000000004
oh the complete scripture of that maybe

478.63 --> 483.34
at some point yeah the problem is I

481.21 --> 484.81
don't I don't technically have a Bible I

483.34 --> 487.27
could probably look it up through the

484.81 --> 490.21
internet I don't have a Bible and I kind

487.27 --> 496.93
of regret that it's so easy to get they

490.21 --> 498.81899999999996
say but yeah which one what type you

496.93 --> 504.31
know there are so many issues now with

498.819 --> 506.65000000000003
that I just shy away from it more and

504.31 --> 509.4
more and prefer to just get people's

506.65 --> 509.4
take on it

512.07 --> 517.259
I don't know what that is but that's

515.219 --> 523.589
that's just what I want what I do what I

517.259 --> 530.97
typically tend to do hmm all right

523.589 --> 532.769
yeah again back to the to what was said

530.97 --> 536.6990000000001
lightest before there before the Sun

532.769 --> 542.91
well if the Sun is indeed as I suspect

536.699 --> 546.1099999999999
an optical side effect that naturally

542.91 --> 550.86
happens when you look in the daylight

546.11 --> 552.63
direction that you just see that disk

550.86 --> 555.3290000000001
then that makes sense because yeah the

552.63 --> 560.31
light is there first and the disk is big

555.329 --> 563.779
basically secondary so you could

560.31 --> 563.779
approach it like that that's interesting

563.839 --> 568.07
and

565.02 --> 568.0699999999999
[Music]

568.41 --> 577.14
yeah it's just like okay daylight is

572.58 --> 580.2900000000001
there before a rainbow you know and in

577.14 --> 582.6899999999999
that sense the Sun the daylight is there

580.29 --> 585.1999999999999
before the Sun I could reason out like

582.69 --> 585.2
that as well

596.189 --> 603.79
that is a really good point there

598.899 --> 606.48
Don threader UK that's you amaze me

603.79 --> 606.48
sometimes

614.959 --> 622.04
you're a bit of an enigma to me

616.85 --> 624.589
sometimes down threader it let me try to

622.04 --> 627.379
attempt to analyze it without

624.589 --> 630.74
pooh-poohing you in any way but you

627.379 --> 636.7090000000001
almost seem like like you have a child's

630.74 --> 638.9590000000001
mind very basic and that seems very near

636.709 --> 642.8889999999999
not very useful in complicated things

638.959 --> 647.929
but at the same time sometimes it does

642.889 --> 650.3290000000001
give you this unique moments of clarity

647.929 --> 652.449
that are also typically inherent to

650.329 --> 654.9799999999999
children and that is kind of interesting

652.449 --> 658.0999999999999
how that works yeah

654.98 --> 660.139
daylight direction there is a direction

658.1 --> 663.649
right and you can determine that by

660.139 --> 666.259
shadows as they're being cast so the

663.649 --> 673.66
shadows being cast basically opposed the

666.259 --> 677.6
daylight direction in that location and

673.66 --> 681.98
yeah in the opposition if you look there

677.6 --> 683.929
you see the Sun disk and when you look

681.98 --> 688.16
at it you basically are looking exactly

683.929 --> 691.579
in the against the daylight direction

688.16 --> 694.16
because the apparent Sun disk is at the

691.579 --> 697.899
epicenter of that daylight direction in

694.16 --> 697.899
relation to the observers position

707.959 --> 716.3699999999999
okay oh boy and it's very trollish a few

711.24 --> 719.01
that's great no I I pretty much wear the

716.37 --> 721.83
same thing all the time I don't have any

719.01 --> 725.22
special clothes I don't wear my poor

721.83 --> 726.6
man's clothes on the show this is just

725.22 --> 728.73
the clothes that I have and

726.6 --> 736.26
unfortunately they tend to wear over

728.73 --> 741.33
time but yeah as soon as opportunity

736.26 --> 744.77
arrives I will refresh them but now's

741.33 --> 744.7700000000001
not really the time for it

761.9 --> 771.64
oh okay sleeping warrior wants to sit

767.15 --> 771.64
talk okay could be interesting

773.98 --> 794.2
Oh Lu he have to wait for this thing to

790.45 --> 802.09
time I'll let me put me on Sam you hang

794.2 --> 804.24
on yeah I need to fix the OBS first hold

802.09 --> 804.24
on

811.689 --> 820.54
why does it always switch to that stupid

814.879 --> 820.54
little box right there you go

821.27 --> 827.77
Oh Riley are you gonna go on I have a

824.99 --> 830.0600000000001
half a mute half of the time again

827.77 --> 833.06
because that is gonna be a little

830.06 --> 837.29
annoying seem to be doing that a lot of

833.06 --> 839.1199999999999
the time and waiting for this dumb thing

837.29 --> 842.24
to guys finished I am I gonna do what

839.12 --> 846.14
did you say no yeah like drop off a take

842.24 --> 849.5
phone calls have wait seem to be doing

846.14 --> 851.6
that a lot possibly busy time for me at

849.5 --> 852.02
the minute so it's possibility I'll be

851.6 --> 854.0
honest

852.02 --> 857.18
grantees available as well if you want a

854.0 --> 868.31
grant if you wanna join on T yeah sure

908.33 --> 911.7
oh yeah

910.14 --> 917.55
is that is that your house or some

911.7 --> 918.9300000000001
analysis is it not a bit of an

917.55 --> 921.3299999999999
occupational risk if we're skyping

918.93 --> 924.0889999999999
whilst you at the top of a ladder well

921.33 --> 926.0400000000001
Mia top of the 25-foot ladder hold it

924.089 --> 929.0100000000001
without holding onto the leather well

926.04 --> 931.89
painting here we go roller in you say

929.01 --> 933.6899999999999
that are you properly insured don't you

931.89 --> 939.48
with I've heard you're a bit dodgy whit

933.69 --> 942.48
ladders now don't try to distract him

939.48 --> 945.45
Riley I'm not holding them with anything

942.48 --> 949.1700000000001
nice fine I've been on mother's since I

945.45 --> 956.339
was well my dad put him oh [ __ ] he just

949.17 --> 958.14
dropped I mean the engine actually my

956.339 --> 959.6400000000001
bottom of my windowsill so I've been

958.14 --> 963.4499999999999
I've been climbing ladders since I was

959.64 --> 964.98
two uncanny I know didn't you lose your

963.45 --> 967.32
footing recently also what fall off of

964.98 --> 969.9590000000001
it yeah well no that was it wasn't it

967.32 --> 973.47
was just off the pair of steps inside I

969.959 --> 975.5699999999999
just you know lost concentration thought

973.47 --> 978.6
there was one step that I was coming off

975.57 --> 981.0790000000001
so I decided to jump off it thinking it

978.6 --> 983.73
was one step it wasn't it was two steps

981.079 --> 994.2299999999999
so of course everything was all screwed

983.73 --> 995.85
up then so I landed weird hmm yeah what

994.23 --> 997.62
mr. honey I need to ask you guys to

995.85 --> 999.45
catch me off a little bit I've heard

997.62 --> 1001.07
rumors that the ballers are now denying

999.45 --> 1004.7
that eight inches for maersk word is

1001.07 --> 1007.0400000000001
accurate it's not the position it's

1004.7 --> 1010.76
pedantic its 7.99

1007.04 --> 1012.0799999999999
they're just being annoying alright so

1010.76 --> 1013.28
they're not denying that this curve it

1012.08 --> 1014.9300000000001
you know they're just saying that the

1013.28 --> 1016.4599999999999
the maths was an eight inches four mile

1014.93 --> 1021.9799999999999
it was seven point it's not isn't it

1016.46 --> 1023.4100000000001
seven point nine eight right yeah so

1021.98 --> 1027.89
that was what the issue was

1023.41 --> 1029.949
yeah it's just more obstruction to just

1027.89 --> 1034.7900000000002
throw more wrenches into work it's just

1029.949 --> 1037.01
filler yeah if it's curving guys it's

1034.79 --> 1037.52
still curving we don't see any curve I

1037.01 --> 1039.589
hope

1037.52 --> 1044.329
hey why make west changes what is a

1039.589 --> 1047.69
curve calculator well no you know he

1044.329 --> 1049.37
changed it line on saying that this this

1047.69 --> 1052.01
curve calculator is useless of the

1049.37 --> 1056.1799999999998
horizon yeah you know yes we put that in

1052.01 --> 1057.65
you know why he did that well because we

1056.18 --> 1058.79
were then able to demonstrate that you

1057.65 --> 1061.3300000000002
can see stuff below the horizon

1058.79 --> 1063.56
continuously regularly and reliably that

1061.33 --> 1065.1499999999999
was probably one reason but the main

1063.56 --> 1066.8899999999999
reason because I confronted him on there

1065.15 --> 1068.66
he was on a smaller channel having a

1066.89 --> 1071.3300000000002
debate there there's only like 30 people

1068.66 --> 1074.21
in the chart and he was you know doing

1071.33 --> 1076.04
his usual Midwest [ __ ] so I jumped I

1074.21 --> 1078.65
got a link and I was able to catch him

1076.04 --> 1081.8
off guard anyway it turns out he's he's

1078.65 --> 1086.75
changed it because of the mirror flash

1081.8 --> 1088.96
observations right obviously if I

1086.75 --> 1094.04
explain them that doesn't work on his

1088.96 --> 1103.07
model so just get around that that's the

1094.04 --> 1104.69
reason it's changed so just bring me up

1103.07 --> 1106.4299999999998
to speed the mirror flash observations

1104.69 --> 1108.0800000000002
away you get the inferior Mirage the

1106.43 --> 1111.5900000000001
reflection underneath but you still seem

1108.08 --> 1113.21
very [ __ ] know where you're at one

1111.59 --> 1114.1999999999998
end of the lake saying someone else

1113.21 --> 1116.3
isn't the other and you just got a

1114.2 --> 1120.5
mirror and you're using the Sun to flush

1116.3 --> 1123.1699999999998
the the reflection across to the person

1120.5 --> 1126.58
filming from the other side so those go

1123.17 --> 1130.64
against his all his calculations all his

1126.58 --> 1132.1399999999999
theories about how light works etc so in

1130.64 --> 1134.7
order to get around that that's why you

1132.14 --> 1136.6190000000001
pulled that that redlining

1134.7 --> 1138.96
all right I thought that just proved

1136.619 --> 1143.1899999999998
that the earth was was flat I didn't

1138.96 --> 1145.109
realize it debunk meta bunk as well and

1143.19 --> 1148.8300000000002
it's quite obvious that's the reason why

1145.109 --> 1149.97
you know you know because it's good then

1148.83 --> 1151.109
so obviously we need to do more of those

1149.97 --> 1155.8790000000001
mirror flashes that's the way I'm

1151.109 --> 1157.499
thinking when Nathan's as Nathan changed

1155.879 --> 1159.029
his former I mean I was waiting

1157.499 --> 1164.429
yesterday for a second show and one

1159.029 --> 1170.519
didn't arrive the world it was waiting

1164.429 --> 1174.23
was Tuesday yesterday what's the one now

1170.519 --> 1175.379
that wasn't very long after show right

1174.23 --> 1179.129
okay

1175.379 --> 1182.039
um I was gonna the other question I was

1179.129 --> 1183.7489999999998
gonna ask was well no when Nathan's not

1182.039 --> 1185.279
on if he doesn't come back on like in a

1183.749 --> 1191.269
relatively quick time I end up like

1185.279 --> 1193.499
venturing over to Don Jose's me to

1191.269 --> 1195.72
understand I will they all sit there and

1193.499 --> 1198.679
just completely just like napping and

1195.72 --> 1201.33
and ignore the points that were making

1198.679 --> 1204.48
points to get to their positions they're

1201.33 --> 1207.029
ignored and still see gravity's mass

1204.48 --> 1208.919
attractive mass and I'm like what what's

1207.029 --> 1210.6
going on ey is it allowed that people

1208.919 --> 1213.1390000000001
are not being practiced by all those who

1210.6 --> 1215.85
state mass attracts mass it's ridiculous

1213.139 --> 1220.139
cos cognitive dissonance is their

1215.85 --> 1221.879
fallback position that's what they do

1220.139 --> 1239.1589999999999
when they're defeated and they can't

1221.879 --> 1250.59
admit he's doing a presentation

1239.159 --> 1252.3590000000002
how is he gonna prove curvature he's

1250.59 --> 1256.549
probably gonna try to prove they're like

1252.359 --> 1261.08
you're making their presentation so I

1256.549 --> 1261.08
don't know means to me

1262.82 --> 1266.57
the point the format will be you know

1265.31 --> 1268.9099999999999
you'll you'll question him on the

1266.57 --> 1270.2
presentation it what's false so it

1268.91 --> 1272.3000000000002
doesn't matter if you've got outstanding

1270.2 --> 1273.89
stuff to talk about you know judge the

1272.3 --> 1275.93
person on the presentation they put

1273.89 --> 1289.21
forth on the day you know see whether it

1275.93 --> 1292.28
holds up are you gonna do one what Riley

1289.21 --> 1293.8700000000001
can I present on now I mean I think I

1292.28 --> 1299.27
said what they don't listen to me what I

1293.87 --> 1301.6699999999998
tell them it's put in a relative hey can

1299.27 --> 1305.3
you hear me guys can you hear me stop

1301.67 --> 1308.68
treat there's no is not a force it can

1305.3 --> 1311.36
not cause anything else causing tides

1308.68 --> 1313.8200000000002
what's causing the atmosphere to stick

1311.36 --> 1315.4099999999999
to the ball because tides are being

1313.82 --> 1316.1299999999999
caused by the moon's gravitational pull

1315.41 --> 1318.02
we're told

1316.13 --> 1321.5300000000002
well if grow if gravity is not a force

1318.02 --> 1327.23
then ain't doing [ __ ] so what is causing

1321.53 --> 1331.8999999999999
tides can you guys hear me you guys hear

1327.23 --> 1338.06
me Riley can you hear me Riley hello

1331.9 --> 1345.2800000000002
hello can you hear me can you hear me

1338.06 --> 1347.84
Riley what the [ __ ] is this can you guys

1345.28 --> 1350.96
it should be the case that ball is like

1347.84 --> 1353.3899999999999
the rumpus or Tim pass just you ask what

1350.96 --> 1357.95
they look and tell you didn't did

1353.39 --> 1362.42
somebody mute me did somebody mute me I

1357.95 --> 1366.32
was muted no I didn't what the hell

1362.42 --> 1369.98
I don't think become me I I wasn't you

1366.32 --> 1372.1399999999999
too did some I was literally yelling at

1369.98 --> 1373.82
you at the last two minutes like hello

1372.14 --> 1383.7800000000002
can anybody hear me

1373.82 --> 1387.22
I was just somebody messing around I

1383.78 --> 1387.22
didn't even have it

1395.81 --> 1402.6799999999998
Oh Oh so you accidentally I didn't meet

1401.18 --> 1404.45
you and I think it rancidity must've

1402.68 --> 1404.9
accidentally you know meet yourself

1404.45 --> 1411.17
r-word

1404.9 --> 1412.7
yeah I didn't you know I was just

1411.17 --> 1415.0700000000002
testing a few of these things the first

1412.7 --> 1419.38
time I've joined the Skype call on maybe

1415.07 --> 1422.48
I did okay okay anyway it's explained

1419.38 --> 1426.8000000000002
but I was just gonna say Riley you have

1422.48 --> 1432.41
to do an relative density experiment

1426.8 --> 1434.78
proof to replace gravity you got to do

1432.41 --> 1439.3400000000001
it yours you've done it so many times

1434.78 --> 1441.83
you should do density that I might might

1439.34 --> 1443.87
demonstrate the parameter cuz it really

1441.83 --> 1445.85
confuses me at what's going on and I

1443.87 --> 1451.8799999999999
genuinely don't know what's going on but

1445.85 --> 1456.59
I know what's not going on oh and guess

1451.88 --> 1458.66
what it's on ramsey guess what I might

1456.59 --> 1483.9499999999998
do my I might do a presentation on your

1458.66 --> 1491.27
show what are we doing the soffits and

1483.95 --> 1494.3500000000001
me do the whole house I've got to try

1491.27 --> 1496.58
and get all try and get on this roof

1494.35 --> 1500.51
rather than using the scaffolding and

1496.58 --> 1506.4099999999999
get up there at the top of tickets and

1500.51 --> 1509.03
what fascias probably get love it and

1506.41 --> 1511.6000000000001
run it off the front and hang off the

1509.03 --> 1514.72
side and paint it that way

1511.6 --> 1514.7199999999998
[Music]

1521.94 --> 1529.05
well then I've got another five or six

1524.22 --> 1530.4
feet further on can you see I'm kind of

1529.05 --> 1538.4099999999999
feeling a little bit queasy in your

1530.4 --> 1550.44
diaphragm see yeah anyway so yeah my cat

1538.41 --> 1551.99
ladder and then climb have you sanded

1550.44 --> 1559.95
down before we just painted over the top

1551.99 --> 1561.54
I've sanded down Oh yesterday I was

1559.95 --> 1562.8
yesterday I was like I was like

1561.54 --> 1568.23
something that just come out of the

1562.8 --> 1570.06
chimney suite Ramsay mr. mr. ronnson it

1568.23 --> 1572.31
he says run T's face doesn't match his

1570.06 --> 1574.4099999999999
voice I reckon saying you've got a dead

1572.31 --> 1592.44
girly face could you guide and don't

1574.41 --> 1593.91
match old face the only one all day and

1592.44 --> 1595.3200000000002
it's like well all the other planes

1593.91 --> 1606.63
aren't laying them how come that was

1595.32 --> 1608.3999999999999
laying it you know flying through the

1606.63 --> 1610.7700000000002
same atmosphere and they were laying

1608.4 --> 1612.45
then why was this particular one laying

1610.77 --> 1616.29
them you know because they had that's

1612.45 --> 1618.15
free or turned on yeah and I don't think

1616.29 --> 1620.67
that the pilots even have any say in it

1618.15 --> 1624.42
it's just the big planes have these

1620.67 --> 1626.48
things on them and there were they are

1624.42 --> 1630.21
remote controlled released

1626.48 --> 1635.9
probably by the military depending on

1630.21 --> 1635.9
the program that's what I think about it

1637.47 --> 1651.029
yeah geoengineering has just fully

1644.159 --> 1653.25
admitted so they told us that we were

1651.029 --> 1654.779
insane you know all the naysayers were

1653.25 --> 1658.639
saying yeah you're insane it's not true

1654.779 --> 1663.559
and of course now they've admitted it

1658.639 --> 1666.6899999999998
yeah same with everything really yeah

1663.559 --> 1669.629
yeah everything comes out in the wash

1666.69 --> 1674.309
eventually apart from gravity that's

1669.629 --> 1676.049
lingering so everybody in chat let's not

1674.309 --> 1685.009
forget gravity is not a force it can't

1676.049 --> 1690.48
cause anything to do anything just a

1685.009 --> 1696.779
concept yeah but we need that gravity go

1690.48 --> 1700.009
for tides no yeah that is kind of

1696.779 --> 1706.82
interesting by the way did you hear that

1700.009 --> 1713.22
apparently certain type of wells they

1706.82 --> 1716.9399999999998
like the water inside rises during was

1713.22 --> 1722.809
it during the tides

1716.94 --> 1724.8200000000002
[Music]

1722.809 --> 1730.889
isn't that interesting

1724.82 --> 1733.049
tell us how you how you explain it right

1730.889 --> 1735.99
well what I think really does cause the

1733.049 --> 1738.99
tides is magnetic influences because

1735.99 --> 1741.09
there is tide maps like live scans

1738.99 --> 1743.659
basically or at least based on life

1741.09 --> 1747.539
scans and then you can see these

1743.659 --> 1750.0
interesting types of patterns that seem

1747.539 --> 1752.25
very magnetic and it's all basically

1750.0 --> 1756.679
happening in this salt ocean so that's

1752.25 --> 1756.679
not surprising but

1757.06 --> 1764.47
there's just this weird interaction here

1761.65 --> 1768.13
on the on the earth where water is just

1764.47 --> 1771.64
being pushed and pulled back and forth

1768.13 --> 1774.2700000000002
in certain directions at these at these

1771.64 --> 1778.48
interval times probably magnetic related

1774.27 --> 1780.61
but that is very visible well in the

1778.48 --> 1784.72
oceans where where the tides really do

1780.61 --> 1788.08
happen but apparently also in inside of

1784.72 --> 1790.57
the water within the land so the

1788.08 --> 1794.59
groundwater is also influenced in some

1790.57 --> 1795.97
way it makes more sense to me the

1794.59 --> 1799.59
pressure is doing it somehow I think

1795.97 --> 1801.64
this is some kind of oh yeah of course

1799.59 --> 1806.26
it's being pushed and pulled

1801.64 --> 1810.22
magnetically somehow yeah and the snares

1806.26 --> 1814.09
this back and forth almost like the

1810.22 --> 1818.23
water or the SAP exchange within a plant

1814.09 --> 1820.81
or a tree it goes back and forth so it's

1818.23 --> 1835.81
almost like the earth itself is like a

1820.81 --> 1840.49
tree Aristarchus but there is a little

1835.81 --> 1843.49
bit more to the theory that like earth

1840.49 --> 1846.6
itself the land masses maybe may have

1843.49 --> 1849.22
been at some point some bizarrely

1846.6 --> 1852.85
ginormous tree in some way a living

1849.22 --> 1857.41
organism because it still seems to

1852.85 --> 1859.75
display functions as if it is a dead

1857.41 --> 1862.75
stump which also has some influences

1859.75 --> 1865.24
until it just rots away but it does

1862.75 --> 1868.0
still keep on displacing water and all

1865.24 --> 1869.83
that that just the roots are a mechanism

1868.0 --> 1871.72
even though the tree is dead the

1869.83 --> 1874.1499999999999
mechanism still stands until it

1871.72 --> 1878.26
completely deteriorates and that seems

1874.15 --> 1882.16
to be somewhat it that is what the earth

1878.26 --> 1884.44
is reminding me of there's still these

1882.16 --> 1887.71
mechanisms here that just kind of

1884.44 --> 1891.1200000000001
suggest like it might have originally

1887.71 --> 1895.029
been some colossal tree somehow

1891.12 --> 1896.9189999999999
it's weird I don't know maybe it's the

1895.029 --> 1898.9
system of some kind it's just not what

1896.919 --> 1901.779
we're being told it's obviously right

1898.9 --> 1904.23
anyway right no gravity everything can

1901.779 --> 1904.23
be explained

1908.76 --> 1943.48
so what do you think about that Randi

1911.62 --> 1948.2199999999998
about the concept we can see ok now you

1943.48 --> 1949.809
broke up oh Mack yeah I want to I want

1948.22 --> 1952.24
to research it without any influences

1949.809 --> 1953.8899999999999
more than anything I don't want to go in

1952.24 --> 1960.73
with any preconceived ideas so I'm

1953.89 --> 1962.529
trying to keep them okay yeah Tod's are

1960.73 --> 1964.1200000000001
interested in once you once you realize

1962.529 --> 1965.529
that gravity's not causing him it's like

1964.12 --> 1967.149
well what is causing all that a volume

1965.529 --> 1969.34
of water I mean you only need to go

1967.149 --> 1970.9289999999999
stand on a pier at Blackpool and look at

1969.34 --> 1973.2099999999998
the volume of water it's on there is

1970.929 --> 1975.13
huge and something making that move and

1973.21 --> 1979.63
it's like to do that it's incredible

1975.13 --> 1984.8500000000001
whatever that forces definitely not I

1979.63 --> 1987.0700000000002
think that we're told oh wait but yeah

1984.85 --> 1989.1999999999998
but I don't think that the presumed

1987.07 --> 1991.559
gravity and what we experienced the

1989.2 --> 1994.57
relative density has anything to do with

1991.559 --> 1998.47
the tides I think that is a completely

1994.57 --> 2001.289
separate effect agree if anything the

1998.47 --> 2004.83
tides brings things out of this out of

2001.289 --> 2007.59
this out of equilibrium and presuppose

2004.83 --> 2011.34
gravity or relative density does does

2007.59 --> 2014.12
the exact opposite so it always brings

2011.34 --> 2018.2099999999998
things to their equilibrium if it can

2014.12 --> 2019.9189999999999
yeah I don't think that gravity or I

2018.21 --> 2022.0
don't think that relative density has

2019.919 --> 2024.8700000000001
got anything to do with tides

2022.0 --> 2024.87
I agree

2030.66 --> 2035.16
I had the Tomas been talking on Jose's

2033.36 --> 2036.6599999999999
last night and how he was saying that he

2035.16 --> 2039.48
doesn't agree with conspiracy cat's

2036.66 --> 2041.43
continual refraction as the explanation

2039.48 --> 2042.96
for everything and I was like at least

2041.43 --> 2048.9900000000002
somebody that's noticing that this is

2042.96 --> 2053.25
just moronic I don't get it though

2048.99 --> 2055.2599999999998
because he's he's convinced that yeah

2053.25 --> 2060.179
with his footage he's always proving a

2055.26 --> 2062.0400000000004
curve and and he's gonna have to stick

2060.179 --> 2065.61
to looming you know with the very

2062.04 --> 2067.86
faraway sights so I I don't see why he's

2065.61 --> 2070.1690000000003
then attacking conspiracy cats because

2067.86 --> 2072.8700000000003
he's claiming the looming effect the

2070.169 --> 2076.1099999999997
refraction doing that because he does

2072.87 --> 2078.179
kind of need it hey I I agree it's

2076.11 --> 2079.5
contradictory to criticize conspiracy

2078.179 --> 2085.679
cats when you've got to explain how we

2079.5 --> 2089.76
see stuff that we shouldn't be seen you

2085.679 --> 2100.4100000000003
drop tariffs for a moment I did oh no no

2089.76 --> 2102.9900000000002
no rant en you're a mute again hmm I'm

2100.41 --> 2105.8399999999997
not no no no you're there and now I'm

2102.99 --> 2107.4599999999996
talking about ranty yeah it seems to be

2105.84 --> 2111.03
having some technical difficulties i

2107.46 --> 2113.36
think yeah he's fellow for again let no

2111.03 --> 2113.36
he hasn't

2116.78 --> 2122.4
ten minutes dude sorry I've been after

2120.81 --> 2125.52
making move in ten minutes I gotta go

2122.4 --> 2128.34
somewhere all right I'll be missing the

2125.52 --> 2131.34
show as well just a shame what the

2128.34 --> 2134.2200000000003
flatters debates yeah yeah all right

2131.34 --> 2136.98
yeah okay well yeah you got to do what

2134.22 --> 2140.8799999999997
you got to do so I hope it's all worth

2136.98 --> 2143.1
it I just want to see proof of curve

2140.88 --> 2144.57
proofing want a few and proof of gravity

2143.1 --> 2150.15
anything else beyond that I don't really

2144.57 --> 2151.6800000000003
care about anything to do with NASA I

2150.15 --> 2153.1800000000003
don't know why boulders love nuts or so

2151.68 --> 2155.31
much is ridiculous all those stuff is

2153.18 --> 2157.41
like come on guys this is clear cuz then

2155.31 --> 2159.0
they tell them what they want to hear

2157.41 --> 2161.69
they show them what they want to see

2159.0 --> 2161.69
that's why

2162.4 --> 2169.239
[Music]

2170.359 --> 2186.569
right yeah it's up to them you know at

2183.96 --> 2190.02
some point in time however long this is

2186.569 --> 2192.599
gonna go on when they're old they will

2190.02 --> 2195.23
probably be reminded like yeah so how

2192.599 --> 2197.6400000000003
much proof have you now seen of this

2195.23 --> 2199.079
supposed to outer space and all that

2197.64 --> 2203.31
with all the stories have you ever been

2199.079 --> 2206.1600000000003
there have you ever seen anything in

2203.31 --> 2208.65
person that confirmed that and you'll

2206.16 --> 2210.81
not find a single person that'll say yes

2208.65 --> 2215.069
to that except if they were supposed to

2210.81 --> 2218.52
be astronauts that's thing isn't it hey

2215.069 --> 2228.42
I just don't know is that I don't know

2218.52 --> 2240.15
how the hello hello who's this

2228.42 --> 2244.65
yes yes I called you do you wanna call

2240.15 --> 2247.109
me back like how this is work what well

2244.65 --> 2250.44
maybe you should just add me first okay

2247.109 --> 2251.22
I'm gonna go back to I was in the middle

2250.44 --> 2253.109
of a hangout

2251.22 --> 2255.24
I don't know how deceive I thought I was

2253.109 --> 2257.19
adding you but this is a separate call

2255.24 --> 2262.0499999999997
apparently I don't know if they can hear

2257.19 --> 2265.13
me so yeah just I'll hang up and we'll

2262.05 --> 2267.6600000000003
talk later all right

2265.13 --> 2270.26
Monty something's not right

2267.66 --> 2270.2599999999998
I'm back

2273.53 --> 2295.67
grantees still on mute grantee we do any

2282.47 --> 2304.12
Widow is pointing at the - that is my

2295.67 --> 2304.12
kisses screwing around with him yeah ooh

2304.52 --> 2311.0
mobile phones I'm hoping that if you go

2308.96 --> 2313.25
into Jose's chat and you and people hear

2311.0 --> 2315.89
people Boulder's claiming gravity to be

2313.25 --> 2318.32
mass attracting mass or causing anything

2315.89 --> 2320.0
I hope people correct them and say

2318.32 --> 2327.2000000000003
gravity's not force doesn't cause

2320.0 --> 2330.01
anything right they're gonna go there

2327.2 --> 2331.91
anyway they're just gonna ignore it

2330.01 --> 2340.6000000000004
that's what they've been doing

2331.91 --> 2344.44
yeah it's a religion of denial deny God

2340.6 --> 2344.44
that's where it all starts

2347.73 --> 2352.95
and there is even baller Christians

2351.15 --> 2356.19
potentially out there and they basically

2352.95 --> 2359.0299999999997
I used to be one of them that would

2356.19 --> 2364.68
first start out denying God and then

2359.03 --> 2367.01
recreating God on top of the denial but

2364.68 --> 2369.0299999999997
that doesn't really work either

2367.01 --> 2378.599
because you're not taking it as a

2369.03 --> 2382.05
foundation anyway I don't think rent is

2378.599 --> 2387.54
gonna come back no I see this guy keeps

2382.05 --> 2389.73
calling me again our vinovich I need to

just see where it goes it today with

2504.15 --> 2506.63
yeah

2512.45 --> 2524.99
yeah for my poster out indeed is every

2515.81 --> 2531.74
Wednesday Dave Johnson those big boys

2524.99 --> 2538.85
around Grumman did today yeah these

2531.74 --> 2540.8599999999997
these ones can you see him down so come

2538.85 --> 2545.5699999999997
down move them around on my shoulder

2540.86 --> 2547.46
one-handed apparently I'm not really a

2545.57 --> 2552.11
decorate easy you know if you believe

2547.46 --> 2554.81
some of these these trolls think that

2552.11 --> 2559.79
don't really have a day job some kind of

2554.81 --> 2563.33
spy or some crazy well you just found a

2559.79 --> 2566.3
new way to expand your CGI studio

2563.33 --> 2568.91
capabilities and I'll have an emulator

2566.3 --> 2573.04
for an actual CGI at work and it's

2568.91 --> 2575.99
pretty successful very convincing data

2573.04 --> 2580.19
I'm glad to see one of these is it

2575.99 --> 2584.9599999999996
Celtic 67 or whatever I'd like to see

2580.19 --> 2588.35
them bring down a pair of little

2584.96 --> 2589.55
fourteen ladders one-handed stick them

2588.35 --> 2591.5
on your shoulder walking around the back

2589.55 --> 2594.1400000000003
of the house what prop them up right and

2591.5 --> 2596.05
the way probably around about in the

2594.14 --> 2598.52
region of about seven Stowe

2596.05 --> 2600.02
I'd like to see them do that and balance

2598.52 --> 2603.38
them that's the hardest part is getting

2600.02 --> 2606.5
the balance right yeah without breaking

2603.38 --> 2608.42
you know that breaking a window without

2606.5 --> 2610.13
making any kinda racket I mean I

2608.42 --> 2612.59
literally did that whilst holding the

2610.13 --> 2614.69
camera on me and talking to you as I

2612.59 --> 2616.46
walked around I even opened the gate

2614.69 --> 2617.9900000000002
with the ladder on the latch actually

2616.46 --> 2621.08
dropped it onto the latch to open the

2617.99 --> 2624.08
gate I don't even know this I know I

2621.08 --> 2625.31
didn't I didn't realize that I'll take a

2624.08 --> 2637.5499999999997
look and see it

2625.31 --> 2639.7
it's unwrapped yeah drop the end of the

2637.55 --> 2639.7000000000003
ladder

2640.25 --> 2647.24
and opened the gate and go into the

2641.69 --> 2648.26
backpack so nice Oh what up well

2647.24 --> 2652.2999999999997
apparently I don't have a day job

2648.26 --> 2652.3
apparently I'm not really a decorator

2656.23 --> 2663.26
I'm just a little bit miffed off with

2658.4 --> 2665.51
that you know all right I get it but

2663.26 --> 2666.94
they're going you know they poke you any

2665.51 --> 2671.0600000000004
way they can

2666.94 --> 2674.06
they know no it might at work I lost

2671.06 --> 2675.619
last year and the amount of money that I

2674.06 --> 2679.099
lost last year from doing all this

2675.619 --> 2681.9500000000003
research this you know what I in doing

2679.099 --> 2683.57
this you know like I said I I did it

2681.95 --> 2685.609
open it cost me thirteen thousand pound

2683.57 --> 2689.06
throughout the year April to April

2685.609 --> 2692.0299999999997
that's how much that last financial year

2689.06 --> 2693.59
cost me thirteen thousand pounds so for

2692.03 --> 2695.3
them to then turn around and say oh he's

2693.59 --> 2697.28
never at work she's never doing any kind

2695.3 --> 2700.28
of work blah blah blah blah blah it's

2697.28 --> 2703.63
like it feels like the trying to bait me

2700.28 --> 2707.48
into stuff you know yeah they are

2703.63 --> 2710.63
absolutely and if anything is probably

2707.48 --> 2713.119
them that don't have a [ __ ] job it's

2710.63 --> 2716.2400000000002
them that don't do what I'm doing here

2713.119 --> 2719.81
and then come home and do eight or nine

2716.24 --> 2721.31
hours of research and and going onto the

2719.81 --> 2725.7799999999997
peoples stream and stuff like that you

2721.31 --> 2727.58
know them the you know they're just you

2725.78 --> 2729.5
know five-minute wanders they come and

2727.58 --> 2731.02
they make a quick video you know they

2729.5 --> 2733.46
don't seem to understand that you know

2731.02 --> 2734.839
people do have feelings and eventually

2733.46 --> 2737.21
things like this is gonna irritate

2734.839 --> 2739.0099999999998
people and get to them you know I don't

2737.21 --> 2740.75
understand if this Celtic is some kind

2739.01 --> 2742.5800000000004
of Flat Earth or what's his issue you

2740.75 --> 2744.98
know right yeah do you still think he is

2742.58 --> 2748.16
Dell we basically know that he isn't

2744.98 --> 2749.93
yeah he is I mean he walks like they'll

2748.16 --> 2753.41
he talks like though he smells like

2749.93 --> 2755.69
though it's Dell all over in it you know

2753.41 --> 2758.5099999999998
I mean there's only one Dell are you

2755.69 --> 2761.599
sure are you sure tells me it is Dell

2758.51 --> 2763.9700000000003
really that unique he types the same way

2761.599 --> 2765.53
is the same mannerisms as Dell we talk

2763.97 --> 2769.0099999999998
you know everything that everything

2765.53 --> 2770.46
about how he presents that Celtic 67 how

2769.01 --> 2774.8390000000004
it comes across them

2770.46 --> 2780.27
Oh Ellie what Dells voice - it need no

2774.839 --> 2782.5499999999997
it was Dell you know I think the other

2780.27 --> 2784.829
one I think the other one is prob well I

2782.55 --> 2786.869
don't know who the other one is he's

2784.829 --> 2787.8590000000004
done a few songs on it it might not even

2786.869 --> 2789.9
be his voice though

2787.859 --> 2792.9
you know mr. jezik might not even be his

2789.9 --> 2800.88
voice we paying someone else to do that

2792.9 --> 2803.099
you know it's we right it's weird that

2800.88 --> 2806.13
if Dell would actually go that for it to

2803.099 --> 2810.51
do that like daddy would really care

2806.13 --> 2811.98
enough to go out and troll people he

2810.51 --> 2813.599
does come on in his own channel now and

2811.98 --> 2816.54
again you know you see him in the chat

2813.599 --> 2818.19
trolling on his own channel so it's just

2816.54 --> 2820.65
another way of him coming in and being

2818.19 --> 2822.68
able to troll but more frequently you

2820.65 --> 2826.9100000000003
know hmm

2822.68 --> 2830.069
he's just creating more havoc trying

2826.91 --> 2833.0989999999997
what it does is he's device if any yeah

2830.069 --> 2841.2
yeah he definitely seems to do that very

2833.099 --> 2845.369
MIT methodically yep but I don't know I

2841.2 --> 2847.41
I find him actually kind of harmless cuz

2845.369 --> 2851.19
it's it's gonna turn it down then

2847.41 --> 2855.18
dead-end for him every time I don't

2851.19 --> 2856.92
particularly mind him well it's more of

2855.18 --> 2860.7
the point of it's his followers that

2856.92 --> 2861.1800000000003
seem to get this belief that you know

2860.7 --> 2863.3089999999997
that

2861.18 --> 2865.41
the only way to understand fire it is to

2863.309 --> 2866.4300000000003
just go out and find the evidence

2865.41 --> 2868.2
yourself you don't need to look at

2866.43 --> 2871.049
anybody else is workable it's all about

2868.2 --> 2872.8489999999997
the individual you know and you can't

2871.049 --> 2874.589
you can't be in a group you can't be in

2872.849 --> 2876.69
a group of people that they're all

2874.589 --> 2878.2799999999997
trying to look at the same thing from a

2876.69 --> 2880.319
different angle just come to some kind

2878.28 --> 2882.829
of consensus you can't have that you

2880.319 --> 2885.66
know I don't understand that philosophy

2882.829 --> 2888.7200000000003
you know it's a it's a philosophy of

2885.66 --> 2889.98
isolation and every each and every one

2888.72 --> 2894.359
of his followers if they're gonna

2889.98 --> 2896.069
actually do that they will it turn out

2894.359 --> 2900.63
just the same like him and they will

2896.069 --> 2902.069
become paranoid and miserable and if

2900.63 --> 2903.589
they don't realize yeah they're going to

2902.069 --> 2909.349
be more Dell clones

2903.589 --> 2911.359
that's true that's right but man I mean

2909.349 --> 2916.009
it's telling people to be individual by

2911.359 --> 2920.3289999999997
following him yeah right you know be

2916.009 --> 2922.16
your own person just like me you know I

2920.329 --> 2925.719
don't understand that

2922.16 --> 2929.719
I'd rather be working with people and

2925.719 --> 2931.699
you know using their knowledge you know

2929.719 --> 2935.299
as a quick way to advance my own

2931.699 --> 2938.779
knowledge mm-hmm indeed and if and you

2935.299 --> 2940.729
know meaning is stolen literally I just

2938.779 --> 2942.019
don't understand people that want it we

2940.729 --> 2943.6989999999996
do you know that tries to be divisive

2942.019 --> 2944.9889999999996
and don't want to actually seal the

2943.699 --> 2948.349
people working with other people I just

2944.989 --> 2953.15
don't understand that I do oh actually I

2948.349 --> 2954.9100000000003
do get on them now it is because it's

2953.15 --> 2957.9990000000003
too much

2954.91 --> 2962.479
people become divisive and obstruction

2957.999 --> 2964.3999999999996
obstructionists when the field whatever

2962.479 --> 2967.999
the pressure is going to be information

2964.4 --> 2970.88
wise or whatever it's too much that's

2967.999 --> 2972.9489999999996
when you start gatekeeping but when you

2970.88 --> 2974.7490000000003
can't control it anymore because it

2972.949 --> 2978.7090000000003
becomes too much for you're losing grip

2974.749 --> 2981.64
then you attack others to try to tone

2978.709 --> 2984.9489999999996
down the frequency stop the progress and

2981.64 --> 2988.67
maintain control over the already known

2984.949 --> 2990.469
fields so I think for Dell that

2988.67 --> 2993.2490000000003
definitely counts but there's more

2990.469 --> 2995.689
people out there that function like this

2993.249 --> 2998.2389999999996
you have two people that really try to

2995.689 --> 3001.839
expand in all directions and really try

2998.239 --> 3004.059
new things out test everything neurotic

3001.839 --> 3006.969
zone and there's people that are

3004.059 --> 3009.789
literally trying to put down a very

3006.969 --> 3013.2690000000002
specific framework and reinforcing that

3009.789 --> 3017.679
and might be very good framework or

3013.269 --> 3021.0989999999997
not-so-good framework but that's just

3017.679 --> 3023.349
how I see what's going on every debater

3021.099 --> 3025.239
has a position in this either they have

3023.349 --> 3028.119
a certain framework they're putting down

3025.239 --> 3030.339
and constantly reinforcing it any way

3028.119 --> 3034.2290000000003
they can or their free thinkers and

3030.339 --> 3034.229
they're constantly testing everything

3034.55 --> 3045.23
and that counts for flat earthers and

3037.31 --> 3047.18
ballers what do you think they're enough

3045.23 --> 3051.08
I mean like I say I mean I don't

3047.18 --> 3055.19
subscribe to that I subscribe to working

3051.08 --> 3057.11
together yes things accomplished you

3055.19 --> 3058.25
know and if that means that you know you

3057.11 --> 3060.56
have to work with people that you don't

3058.25 --> 3067.49
particularly like well at least you get

3060.56 --> 3069.32
get the answers you know yeah of course

3067.49 --> 3071.6299999999997
yeah if there is a common goal that you

3069.32 --> 3076.8700000000003
can achieve together that you can as an

3071.63 --> 3081.29
individual then it's definitely worth

3076.87 --> 3083.87
enduring some more annoying sides to get

3081.29 --> 3089.24
that thing accomplished I try to do that

3083.87 --> 3091.94
as well you know because for example

3089.24 --> 3094.58
like quantum eraser really annoys me at

3091.94 --> 3096.98
times just his attitude it's just

3094.58 --> 3099.02
negative and I don't like it I don't

3096.98 --> 3102.11
find it constructive in any way but he's

3099.02 --> 3105.56
unrelenting at it and Nathan's Nathan's

3102.11 --> 3107.78
just gonna have him do whatever he wants

3105.56 --> 3111.77
to do most of the time although he's

3107.78 --> 3115.57
kind of toning it down it seems yeah but

3111.77 --> 3117.77
yeah I will just have to tolerate it I

3115.57 --> 3121.79
wouldn't say it's negative but just say

3117.77 --> 3124.25
is it broke you know very abrupt

3121.79 --> 3128.69
nobody is either wanted it's like a one

3124.25 --> 3132.97
track train the problem is argument

3128.69 --> 3142.2200000000003
about gas pressure next to it you know

3132.97 --> 3144.3799999999997
next vacuum right no but I'm not even

3142.22 --> 3146.12
attacking his arguments I'm not even a

3144.38 --> 3149.53
Terry I'm not even attacking his

3146.12 --> 3153.02
arguments I'm attacking his input he

3149.53 --> 3156.65
introduces negativity when there was

3153.02 --> 3160.22
none so he starts out and then literally

3156.65 --> 3161.39
starts yelling at people or calling them

3160.22 --> 3163.64
all kinds of names

3161.39 --> 3165.48
and he does that every time he

3163.64 --> 3171.24
introduces negativity

3165.48 --> 3173.28
that's just useless oh yeah well yeah

3171.24 --> 3176.5499999999997
suppose I just you know I'm nothing

3173.28 --> 3181.94
against quantum eraser as a person you

3176.55 --> 3181.94
know as a as a way the debates are going

3184.13 --> 3192.7200000000003
a totalitarian dictatorship you know you

3190.38 --> 3194.88
must follow this train of thought we

3192.72 --> 3205.4599999999996
must follow this train of thought

3194.88 --> 3205.46
it's the way like I say if that fails

3205.49 --> 3212.25
its whole everything about what he's

3210.57 --> 3214.6800000000003
been saying Falls you know the whole

3212.25 --> 3217.619
premise of Nathan because literally

3214.68 --> 3234.29
Nathan who's made his whole whole show

3217.619 --> 3234.29
around this because I don't as this boy

3234.65 --> 3240.3
you know things change things change I

3238.23 --> 3242.22
mean a year and a half ago the globe is

3240.3 --> 3243.96
had the inferior Mirage is there proof

3242.22 --> 3246.72
you know that was their little holy

3243.96 --> 3248.16
grail I explained nine percent of

3246.72 --> 3252.2999999999997
observations you know the inferior

3248.16 --> 3255.6
Mirage now that's changed you know now

3252.3 --> 3257.52
they accept that inferior Mirage isn't

3255.6 --> 3259.77
you know where the curvature of the

3257.52 --> 3261.42
earth is all the horizon line so that's

3259.77 --> 3264.39
been a step forward but a year and half

3261.42 --> 3267.7200000000003
ago that was their baby this this time

3264.39 --> 3270.69
this year now baby is gas pressure next

3267.72 --> 3272.85
to a vacuum that changes and if you just

3270.69 --> 3275.28
stick your whole house you know if

3272.85 --> 3277.0499999999997
you've got an argument and you base

3275.28 --> 3280.38
everything around that one thing and

3277.05 --> 3283.7400000000002
then that fails then you're gonna be

3280.38 --> 3285.84
left so far behind the arguments and we

3283.74 --> 3287.52
had to come back that's why I would like

3285.84 --> 3290.19
to address the arguments that they've

3287.52 --> 3292.29
the globus have on their ground you know

3290.19 --> 3294.18
I want to beg the question with them you

3292.29 --> 3295.14
know because if the is the gas pressure

3294.18 --> 3297.45
with that

3295.14 --> 3301.68
I'm sorry that this is just overboard

3297.45 --> 3304.68
look look Daniel tried to do this exact

3301.68 --> 3306.839
thing this morning in my chat it's like

3304.68 --> 3308.43
and said look the second law of

3306.839 --> 3310.38
thermodynamics it's a wrong

3308.43 --> 3313.049
interpretation let me get all these

3310.38 --> 3318.119
quotes and it was basically other

3313.049 --> 3321.18
people's opinions on it and nothing was

3318.119 --> 3324.15
gonna be based on any kind of physical

3321.18 --> 3325.2889999999998
proof whatsoever and that's because

3324.15 --> 3328.529
there is none

3325.289 --> 3331.829
it's a winning point it's one of those

3328.529 --> 3334.95
points that cannot be overthrown say

3331.829 --> 3336.69
that now so yeah you know at this moment

3334.95 --> 3339.359
in time I agree with you

3336.69 --> 3345.329
well I'm not gonna stake my house my

3339.359 --> 3348.029
entire argument on one claim is anybody

3345.329 --> 3351.7490000000003
making you or making anyone do that

3348.029 --> 3354.45
really if it was over imagining that

3351.749 --> 3356.549
somehow it was overthrown there was a

3354.45 --> 3359.73
vacuum next to gas pressure somehow

3356.549 --> 3362.519
demonstrated okay okay that point is

3359.73 --> 3364.65
then no longer completely valid there's

3362.519 --> 3366.1189999999997
more issues and then what do you think

3364.65 --> 3369.98
it's the end of the show when that

3366.119 --> 3372.9
happens no well so what's the point then

3369.98 --> 3377.089
so I stayed on to do the after-show in

3372.9 --> 3377.089
eighth yesterday and it was a case of

3377.299 --> 3382.47
they wanted me they put me in a

3381.269 --> 3387.2099999999996
situation where they were asking me

3382.47 --> 3388.8289999999997
about Narnia and then look if you go to

3387.21 --> 3390.509
you know if you want to discuss Narnia

3388.829 --> 3392.46
and you wanna discuss the color of the

3390.509 --> 3394.2
grass in Narnia or whatever would you

3392.46 --> 3395.5190000000002
just rather D you know just say that

3394.2 --> 3397.23
Narnia doesn't exist

3395.519 --> 3398.91
you know same sort of thing you know

3397.23 --> 3402.18
they kept asking it and if you've asked

3398.91 --> 3404.3689999999997
me this the last weet-bix it's like I'm

3402.18 --> 3406.8289999999997
not gonna be put in a box I'm not gonna

3404.369 --> 3410.579
give I'm not gonna say what you want me

3406.829 --> 3412.829
to say which is okay let's just say no

3410.579 --> 3415.0190000000002
and it doesn't exist right I'm not going

3412.829 --> 3417.44
to do that so and the reason I'm not

3415.019 --> 3421.1699999999996
going to doing this is because it's one

3417.44 --> 3423.66
proof that could be at some point in

3421.17 --> 3427.529
time not now it could be in a year's

3423.66 --> 3428.23
time or so it could be debunked I'm not

3427.529 --> 3430.21
saying it's gone

3428.23 --> 3432.04
I'm not saying that there's no logical

3430.21 --> 3435.099
reason why you should be what the one

3432.04 --> 3437.77
thing I won't do is take all of their

3435.099 --> 3439.69
research around that one claim which is

3437.77 --> 3444.0099999999998
what seems to be happening over the flat

3439.69 --> 3446.589
base right now I don't think so I think

3444.01 --> 3449.349
that only John does that and nathan is

3446.589 --> 3452.349
just going aboard look at me people have

3449.349 --> 3454.3590000000004
switched in our understandings before

3452.349 --> 3457.03
like in the earlier parts of the debates

3454.359 --> 3458.41
when we're still trying to figure out

3457.03 --> 3462.28
what we were seeing at the horizon

3458.41 --> 3464.71
everything right and we had our opinions

3462.28 --> 3467.2900000000004
we had our angles to it and then things

3464.71 --> 3472.03
changed nobody's holding the opinions

3467.29 --> 3475.15
from before that against us okay so I

3472.03 --> 3477.2200000000003
don't see the issue Nathan look if it's

3475.15 --> 3481.7200000000003
dispelled somehow Nathan will be like oh

3477.22 --> 3484.39
[ __ ] and just like move on and if John's

3481.72 --> 3486.9399999999996
gonna go all ballistic over it then

3484.39 --> 3488.98
John's gonna be kicked out because that

3486.94 --> 3490.869
yeah will prove that it doesn't make

3488.98 --> 3493.359
that he doesn't is not reliable anymore

3490.869 --> 3495.79
unless he does have a really good

3493.359 --> 3498.31
follow-up response that does actually

3495.79 --> 3506.14
make some kind of sense so who knows I

3498.31 --> 3510.099
don't know it just seemed to be overly

3506.14 --> 3512.98
careful I think there's no good but

3510.099 --> 3514.569
there is good it's good to presuppose to

3512.98 --> 3516.7
get closer to somebody and have a

3514.569 --> 3519.609
discussion and hear them out because of

3516.7 --> 3521.68
the curiosities of the mind and that's

3519.609 --> 3523.93
very interesting like how could they

3521.68 --> 3527.47
come to that conclusion that's more

3523.93 --> 3530.109
about psychology than about opinion in

3527.47 --> 3535.3799999999997
fidgets physics and understanding in

3530.109 --> 3540.25
that so I don't see why you'd have to

3535.38 --> 3543.55
like pull away from that physics type of

3540.25 --> 3545.44
thinking just to accommodate for the

3543.55 --> 3548.26
psychology why can't you do both I do

3545.44 --> 3549.4900000000002
both because you're not listening a lot

3548.26 --> 3550.119
of people say this about you oh and

3549.49 --> 3551.95
you're not listening

3550.119 --> 3554.44
you literally not listen to half give

3551.95 --> 3558.91
you the unlike three times now which is

3554.44 --> 3560.859
it's one claim one claim just one and it

3558.91 --> 3561.85
only takes a new bit of information a

3560.859 --> 3563.89
new bit of something

3561.85 --> 3566.56
to come along that can pull that claim

3563.89 --> 3569.5299999999997
apart now I'm not gonna focus everything

3566.56 --> 3570.16
on just one claim that's it I'm not

3569.53 --> 3572.71
gonna do that

3570.16 --> 3574.5099999999998
you know John might want to Nathan might

3572.71 --> 3575.77
want to go along with that right now but

3574.51 --> 3577.96
I'm not going to be that one of those

3575.77 --> 3580.6
cheerleaders that does that because I

3577.96 --> 3584.62
don't feel that we have you know there

3580.6 --> 3586.81
are other ways we can address the claims

3584.62 --> 3589.21
of the globo's buying meeting them on

3586.81 --> 3592.15
their ground and tackling their evidence

3589.21 --> 3593.89
on their ground so we don't have to do

3592.15 --> 3596.29
all this let's cut them off at the knees

3593.89 --> 3599.41
type of thing you know we can beat them

3596.29 --> 3601.63
or at least try to beat them on their

3599.41 --> 3603.37
own ground you know well I don't know

3601.63 --> 3605.32
where you say I'm not listening because

3603.37 --> 3610.0
I am listening and I totally agree with

3605.32 --> 3612.9700000000003
you in that and I do with that okay

3610.0 --> 3614.95
right listen I'm about to drive off get

3612.97 --> 3619.8999999999996
some lunch all right

3614.95 --> 3623.0499999999997
yeah as well no oh yeah thanks for for

3619.9 --> 3625.86
yeah coming on and talking about this I

3623.05 --> 3625.86
do appreciate it

3631.53 --> 3636.4100000000003
[Music]

3633.309 --> 3639.17
broke up last few seconds anyway yeah

3636.41 --> 3648.049
thanks Randy for coming and Riley early

3639.17 --> 3649.4590000000003
he dropped earlier I think there may

3648.049 --> 3655.519
have been a little miscommunication

3649.459 --> 3657.529
there because I think that I ran t me

3655.519 --> 3660.859
were pretty much on the same line and I

3657.529 --> 3665.18
I don't really see the productivity in

3660.859 --> 3668.8289999999997
just being a killing the first second

3665.18 --> 3671.269
type of debater as what aunty describes

3668.829 --> 3673.489
is happening on the flat earth debates I

3671.269 --> 3675.319
don't really agree with that either I

3673.489 --> 3680.589
think it's become it will become

3675.319 --> 3684.579
monotonous monotonous and not yield

3680.589 --> 3687.43
development type of thing it'll halt

3684.579 --> 3692.8390000000004
eventually they'll halt the development

3687.43 --> 3694.6699999999996
so yeah that I agree to that and that's

3692.839 --> 3698.0589999999997
why I do allow people to presuppose

3694.67 --> 3701.42
sometimes if it's gonna go get anywhere

3698.059 --> 3704.029
if they're just presupposing to ignore

3701.42 --> 3705.4990000000003
something else then yeah that's

3704.029 --> 3708.92
something else that that's another

3705.499 --> 3711.6789999999996
