61.6 --> 72.61
chat be much appreciated yeah

67.83 --> 74.92
starting bit early today just feel like

72.61 --> 78.039
waiting anymore yeah the weather today

74.92 --> 82.0
is interesting it's look at that super

78.039 --> 88.619
clear blue sky but still surrounded by

82.0 --> 91.619
clouds so quite different it's very

88.619 --> 91.619
picturesque

97.01 --> 112.81
so yeah it's not it's pretty dry bit

101.87 --> 118.28
windy not very cold but yeah all right

112.81 --> 120.38
so let's see who is in chat probably not

118.28 --> 124.13
too many because I'm starting early ten

120.38 --> 127.75999999999999
minutes so yeah Jorge Sanford was first

124.13 --> 133.84
yielder Klein Giulio Pavan a man a young

127.76 --> 139.85
mark Marshall Stacy B Martin Allen

133.84 --> 147.47
Gregory Hampton right that's actually

139.85 --> 158.35999999999999
plenty so yeah good to see you all yeah

147.47 --> 163.07
long day yesterday see ya flat earth

158.36 --> 168.26000000000002
debates was pretty good yeah with the

163.07 --> 172.54999999999998
rumpus man that robbed us he's hilarious

168.26 --> 177.5
and yeah I really think he is hilarious

172.55 --> 179.36
like he is devious but I think it's it's

177.5 --> 181.79
funny because it's like really like a

179.36 --> 183.47000000000003
personal desperation it seems that that

181.79 --> 188.29999999999998
drives him to keep on doing what he does

183.47 --> 190.25
and so so tenacious and it's just I

188.3 --> 192.29000000000002
don't know I think it's hilarious but it

190.25 --> 194.08
does get so disruptive eventually that

192.29 --> 198.739
you just can't hear anything anymore

194.08 --> 202.31
it'll just mute with mute mute mute this

198.739 --> 205.1
is new thing the utter utter utter

202.31 --> 207.77
changed into mute mute mute mute mute

205.1 --> 209.84
and he's done a lot of practice it seems

207.77 --> 212.98000000000002
because it's pretty difficult to do it

209.84 --> 212.98
fluid and that quick

216.98 --> 234.87
right Oh Benjamin I think was it yeah

230.01 --> 240.85899999999998
and of course the main you had the main

234.87 --> 244.92000000000002
late night dinner to me was Randy show

240.859 --> 246.84
Randy show was pretty epic he played a

244.92 --> 249.88899999999998
bit of a bootleg and then he opened up

246.84 --> 256.049
the panel I was part of that and yeah

249.889 --> 260.459
that was absolutely interesting so weird

256.049 --> 262.56
to have pj on there as well and but yeah

260.459 --> 265.68
one brenda eventually came in she just

262.56 --> 267.66
ruined it I thought like yeah it's this

265.68 --> 270.26
isn't really gonna go anywhere it's just

267.66 --> 273.59900000000005
such a red herring slippery fest

270.26 --> 278.0
there's and nothing will rub off anymore

273.599 --> 282.57
what'd you say so I just left eventually

278.0 --> 284.16
but that went on for hours like even

282.57 --> 286.40999999999997
after the show it and the panel just

284.16 --> 288.99
kept on going I checked in there like

286.41 --> 293.03000000000003
three o'clock at night and they were

288.99 --> 293.03000000000003
still talking Rena was still going

299.4 --> 302.65999999999997
a and a koala

307.159 --> 310.779
Gideon snake

317.53 --> 320.72999999999996
mother Salim

327.87 --> 333.699
but yeah that show was pretty cool it

330.629 --> 336.93
was funny also it like the timing

333.699 --> 339.159
I don't know ranty probably saw like a

336.93 --> 343.029
it probably looked at it again and

339.159 --> 346.18
thought like yeah that's funny

343.029 --> 350.339
it's like a a prequel to what has been

346.18 --> 352.99
happening to the Black Swan like John

350.339 --> 355.569
was really yeah it was already kind of

352.99 --> 362.139
going but it was yeah it was it was a

355.569 --> 364.36
good after yeah bootlegged after show so

362.139 --> 366.159
yeah great show check it out if you

364.36 --> 368.889
haven't it's very long but it's

366.159 --> 375.029
definitely worth watching I thought it

368.889 --> 375.029
was very very amusing my good sir

380.25 --> 384.47
yeah

382.56 --> 390.03000000000003
[Music]

384.47 --> 392.72900000000004
all right open walk I'm pretty sure that

390.03 --> 400.979
there's no chemtrails going on the sky

392.729 --> 404.07
is a way to blue for that and that's

400.979 --> 408.74
also a bit good about rainy and windy

404.07 --> 408.74
weather it really washes the sky clean

421.36 --> 434.319
and right Gideon's sick yeah I mentioned

424.419 --> 437.349
that it's I think it's more about the

434.319 --> 441.069
concept of the Black Swan like John is

437.349 --> 443.62
always about these concepts it's like

441.069 --> 449.56
very well first in that specific region

443.62 --> 453.159
of what is it of academics I guess you

449.56 --> 456.94
could call it academics just like Riley

453.159 --> 461.349
is into lawyer academics kind of thing

456.94 --> 465.19
so because John is so much into

461.349 --> 466.78
academics I hope I got the terminology

465.19 --> 470.44
right I think it's pretty much yeah

466.78 --> 472.27
academics the Black Swan he's just

470.44 --> 474.37
taking it as a subject it's like almost

472.27 --> 477.159
a teacher teaching like okay now we're

474.37 --> 480.34000000000003
gonna talk about this subject for this

477.159 --> 482.229
period you know that that's that's the

480.34 --> 483.87899999999996
the practical thing that's happening

482.229 --> 487.21
because yeah black swans have been

483.879 --> 490.93
brought up funnily enough even PJ during

487.21 --> 493.85999999999996
rent he said like yeah but but we we had

490.93 --> 498.58
a Black Swan already John's an agent and

493.86 --> 501.069
like yeah PJ we know even remember PJ

498.58 --> 503.589
bringing up the Black Swan in 2014 at

501.069 --> 508.719
some point in some hangout and it was

503.589 --> 512.68
yeah it's like good point but it yeah PJ

508.719 --> 514.63
is anything but an academic this is the

512.68 --> 516.699
quite the opposite so it doesn't really

514.63 --> 519.8389999999999
rub off it just uses the attention

516.699 --> 522.789
moment to then start asserting his

519.839 --> 525.4300000000001
Aristarchus nonsense story without

522.789 --> 528.22
technicals and just correlation in

525.43 --> 530.92
numbers and northern aims and and that

528.22 --> 535.089
so yeah people then forget about it but

530.92 --> 539.079
John doesn't do that [ __ ] it's like very

535.089 --> 542.2900000000001
rigid with his academic approach and so

539.079 --> 544.75
he's just yeah really holding it up so

542.29 --> 547.0889999999999
everybody can take a good look this is

544.75 --> 550.449
what he chooses to do and the group is

547.089 --> 553.73
kind of like yeah that's a good idea

550.449 --> 554.9799999999999
let's do that so that's really what's

553.73 --> 558.1990000000001
going on

554.98 --> 561.399
concerning the Black Swan because it has

558.199 --> 561.399
been brought forward before

565.38 --> 568.5
[Music]

574.67 --> 586.4599999999999
right in yeah and also the God didn't

580.49 --> 588.76
sick but yeah ran teased shot where he

586.46 --> 591.71
put the camera basically in the water

588.76 --> 596.15
you could literally see the wave right

591.71 --> 598.76
in front of it wobbling sometimes and he

596.15 --> 601.37
took a shot from several several

598.76 --> 604.34
kilometers away from the beach of an

601.37 --> 606.62
island in this and so that was also a

604.34 --> 608.48
Black Swan and we kinda knew it back

606.62 --> 610.72
then we just didn't really realize the

608.48 --> 613.04
terminology we weren't emphasizing that

610.72 --> 614.72
we're just like yeah that's impossible

613.04 --> 616.28
on the globe should be obstructed

614.72 --> 621.77
according to the curvature calculated

616.28 --> 623.56
which we still hadn't completely figured

621.77 --> 626.0
out yet we already suspecting that

623.56 --> 628.5799999999999
perspective wasn't being excluded and

626.0 --> 631.16
replaced by the autographic curvature

628.58 --> 633.35
and all that but we hadn't completely

631.16 --> 636.17
figured it out yet it's like funny like

633.35 --> 639.11
everything is in a growing process and

636.17 --> 641.9599999999999
you can really see what the effect is of

639.11 --> 644.72
a certain level of growth in the overall

641.96 --> 647.21
view on how things are seen in an

644.72 --> 649.5500000000001
explained it's fascinating to see the

647.21 --> 653.36
development even of myself by the way I

649.55 --> 656.24
think I don't know maybe that's not

653.36 --> 659.0600000000001
narcissistic or anything but I am very

656.24 --> 662.6
curious to my own development I really

659.06 --> 666.7399999999999
am it's big and I guess I do it also for

662.6 --> 670.37
professional reasons I do often watch my

666.74 --> 674.48
own shows back to just see what was good

670.37 --> 678.17
is it as I remember it was as I was

674.48 --> 681.14
doing it that kind of thing and also

678.17 --> 684.26
when I explained very complicated things

681.14 --> 687.4399999999999
especially ethereal things how much can

684.26 --> 689.36
I get across do I even remember when

687.44 --> 693.35
hearing it back what I was actually

689.36 --> 696.4300000000001
thinking and then how well will other

693.35 --> 696.4300000000001
people understand that

697.28 --> 702.14
because if I notice like wow I seem to

699.89 --> 703.9399999999999
be lacking here and there with this type

702.14 --> 705.92
of explanation then I'm going to have

703.94 --> 709.19
extra attention for it the next time it

705.92 --> 713.39
comes up see ya I guess it's not

709.19 --> 720.0200000000001
narcissistic it's just professional it's

713.39 --> 723.01
studying me as a as a as a speaker as a

720.02 --> 723.01
live performer

731.479 --> 738.6600000000001
but I also keep track of other people

733.949 --> 740.309
you know how they develop and I like to

738.66 --> 742.559
give people tips every now and then

740.309 --> 748.889
don't overload them because then just

742.559 --> 751.019
becomes annoying you know the best way

748.889 --> 753.239
to teach is really to find the right

751.019 --> 756.449
moment for a certain type of it for me

753.239 --> 757.7090000000001
like there has to be a want for the

756.449 --> 759.269
specific thing you're gonna be

757.709 --> 761.699
forwarding because if you're just gonna

759.269 --> 765.059
forward then it's gonna be like hey

761.699 --> 767.2199999999999
maybe should let me do my own thing you

765.059 --> 769.9789999999999
know I'll figure it out by a lot of

767.22 --> 772.619
people response it like that because I

769.979 --> 775.379
used to give a lot of people unwanted

772.619 --> 778.259
advice like in the period 20 years ago I

775.379 --> 779.91
would constantly do that it's it was a

778.259 --> 782.369
bit neurotic and it was annoying it was

779.91 --> 784.189
also born from desperation as to that I

782.369 --> 786.839
didn't really know what else to do I

784.189 --> 791.009
would just get stuck on starting

786.839 --> 795.8090000000001
analyzing people it was people thought I

791.009 --> 800.879
was kind of autistic like that it was

795.809 --> 805.5889999999999
weird but yeah I've changed a lot thank

800.879 --> 808.139
God thank God cousin wasn't a lot of fun

805.589 --> 809.8190000000001
well it was interesting doing that all

808.139 --> 814.47
the time but it just feel felt

809.819 --> 817.649
disconnected a lot from everyone like

814.47 --> 822.499
the analysis would almost be a desperate

817.649 --> 825.299
secondary to not actually getting or

822.499 --> 828.149
being frustrated over not really have a

825.299 --> 831.059
grip as to how to change it in a way

828.149 --> 832.769
that I want from my own actions you know

831.059 --> 835.919
I could analyze things but I didn't

832.769 --> 839.85
really know what to do about a lot of

835.919 --> 841.739
things because I could only imagine it

839.85 --> 843.799
from my own perspective and say like

841.739 --> 847.409
yeah I would do this oh that would work

843.799 --> 849.3589999999999
but I would not be able to figure out

847.409 --> 852.929
how I was different from the other

849.359 --> 854.85
individual really like I could see the

852.929 --> 858.48
differences but I didn't understand the

854.85 --> 860.909
consequences of how a personality then

858.48 --> 862.47
makes different decisions sits in a

860.909 --> 863.1
different freak I didn't see all that

862.47 --> 866.09
back then

863.1 --> 866.09
I do now

866.6 --> 869.809
[Music]

880.46 --> 885.76
I don't give advice as a psychologist I

888.16 --> 897.41
guess I get a give advice just as a as a

893.72 --> 901.13
I don't know as a good act to help it's

897.41 --> 905.3299999999999
Christian it feels a bit like my

901.13 --> 907.55
redemption for my other lacking because

905.33 --> 910.0400000000001
I do lack in some regions definitely I'm

907.55 --> 919.52
not gonna pretend like that's not going

910.04 --> 923.62
on and some people do want advice or

919.52 --> 923.62
they a day at least want to air you out

923.74 --> 928.4590000000001
but with when I mean give people and

926.69 --> 930.3800000000001
wanted advice it's really just like

928.459 --> 933.25
you're getting somewhere you get to know

930.38 --> 937.3
people and suddenly without even like

933.25 --> 940.67
letting them get to know you first right

937.3 --> 942.77
not breaking into a conversation getting

940.67 --> 944.4799999999999
to that place where suddenly people

942.77 --> 946.9399999999999
become more open and all that you know

944.48 --> 949.5500000000001
cuffs no I would just start out like oh

946.94 --> 955.8800000000001
yeah you're like this and that and that

949.55 --> 959.0
right and it's just super awkward but

955.88 --> 961.55
yeah I don't do that I sometimes do it

959.0 --> 964.839
with other people talking about other

961.55 --> 966.89
individuals still but that's different

964.839 --> 969.7900000000001
you don't do that to somebody's face

966.89 --> 969.79
it's just odd

972.06 --> 978.16
right Gideon's sake I know most people

975.22 --> 981.4
don't expose themselves like I do the

978.16 --> 984.67
weird thing is that originally I kind of

981.4 --> 986.8
did that by accident and I would not

984.67 --> 989.5899999999999
really have nefarious things to keep

986.8 --> 991.42
back but I would like make myself look

989.59 --> 992.86
like a fool by being very honest about

991.42 --> 996.49
something that people shouldn't talk

992.86 --> 1000.3000000000001
about it's super embarrassing but like

996.49 --> 1002.55
even about sex things and it's weird

1000.3 --> 1007.04
because nowadays people talk about that

1002.55 --> 1011.43
[ __ ] and that seems to be normal but

1007.04 --> 1014.76
like 2530 years ago when I was still

1011.43 --> 1018.51
very young yeah that was incredibly

1014.76 --> 1020.8199999999999
weird in the circles that I was at to be

1018.51 --> 1023.1899999999999
open about such things and they would

1020.82 --> 1026.3400000000001
then proceed to bully the [ __ ] out of me

1023.19 --> 1028.56
for it for like a week or more and I

1026.34 --> 1030.6599999999999
would accidentally slip it out like who

1028.56 --> 1032.49
would accidentally just be super honest

1030.66 --> 1035.16
like yeah you're my colleagues and my

1032.49 --> 1037.29
friends and and my family while they

1035.16 --> 1039.3300000000002
were just random kids in school that

1037.29 --> 1045.06
didn't even like me it was very weird

1039.33 --> 1047.55
how that work I would just over I that's

1045.06 --> 1051.78
like the group affect the group effect

1047.55 --> 1054.44
for me almost if I if I not careful with

1051.78 --> 1057.78
if I basically just feed into it without

1054.44 --> 1060.6000000000001
restraint then it's almost like getting

1057.78 --> 1064.56
drunk for me literally it has a drunk

1060.6 --> 1066.4399999999998
effect probably chemically has that

1064.56 --> 1069.84
effect for some reason it's just

1066.44 --> 1072.3600000000001
inherent in my genetics I think my dad

1069.84 --> 1075.06
has the weird tendency to he also has

1072.36 --> 1078.6899999999998
learned to deal with it very much better

1075.06 --> 1083.61
than I have but he's also a holder of

1078.69 --> 1086.6100000000001
course but yeah that effect cost me to

1083.61 --> 1090.03
blur out a lot of things that made

1086.61 --> 1091.9199999999998
people social Shamy like bad like

1090.03 --> 1094.02
austere size and they couldn't get away

1091.92 --> 1096.66
like being ostracized in your school

1094.02 --> 1098.1
that's horrific trust me I've been

1096.66 --> 1101.77
through it a lot

1098.1 --> 1107.26
like decade altogether through that type

1101.77 --> 1108.04
of situation and I nobody knew what to

1107.26 --> 1109.66
do about it

1108.04 --> 1111.57
my parents didn't know what to do about

1109.66 --> 1113.95
it I didn't know what to do about it

1111.57 --> 1116.77
teachers didn't know what to do about it

1113.95 --> 1118.3600000000001
so it's just like okay I guess the

1116.77 --> 1119.8899999999999
teachers some teachers thought okay

1118.36 --> 1121.4799999999998
we'll just pay some little extra

1119.89 --> 1123.5800000000002
attention to him it seems to appreciate

1121.48 --> 1126.64
it a lot and I did it's like one-on-one

1123.58 --> 1130.3
teaching oh my god I am built for that

1126.64 --> 1131.2900000000002
I just assimilate I copy pasted things

1130.3 --> 1133.9289999999999
literally

1131.29 --> 1136.51
I can copy routines just by mimicking

1133.929 --> 1138.49
them it's incredible that type of

1136.51 --> 1141.37
learning setup works really well for me

1138.49 --> 1144.8700000000001
with somebody that's really smart as to

1141.37 --> 1147.1
they have to be more experienced than me

1144.87 --> 1148.9289999999999
so I don't know if it's still gonna have

1147.1 --> 1152.05
work as well since I know much more

1148.929 --> 1153.7900000000002
experience much older but I don't know

1152.05 --> 1157.4099999999999
other people that have that same effect

1153.79 --> 1159.61
we would probably work together great

1157.41 --> 1161.92
I've been hoping to kind of find a

1159.61 --> 1168.7299999999998
female partner that's like that that

1161.92 --> 1171.94
would be epic mmm but I'm getting on off

1168.73 --> 1174.91
the rails here so object wise yeah

1171.94 --> 1179.26
because I've always been so accidentally

1174.91 --> 1181.96
honest I've I've not been able to

1179.26 --> 1185.25
correct that as it were not being able

1181.96 --> 1188.23
to stop that early on so instead I

1185.25 --> 1190.03
thought like yet it's it's too now I

1188.23 --> 1192.34
don't want to not do it I want to be

1190.03 --> 1198.1
honest it's natural so I'm going to

1192.34 --> 1200.8
instead perfect my my actions I'm going

1198.1 --> 1203.6999999999998
to be basically like a knight or a

1200.8 --> 1207.19
paladin I got that idea pretty early on

1203.7 --> 1209.77
it's like yeah it is redic it is

1207.19 --> 1212.679
ridiculous it is like oh that's so dumb

1209.77 --> 1217.96
or useless or what do you believe the

1212.679 --> 1219.7900000000002
god a lot of atheists around and I

1217.96 --> 1221.89
wouldn't even make it about God I would

1219.79 --> 1224.26
just make it about the the principle the

1221.89 --> 1227.0700000000002
method by doing right being honest and

1224.26 --> 1231.429
so the accident and not being

1227.07 --> 1233.809
accidentally blurring out on the STIs

1231.429 --> 1237.169
and not being able to correct for that

1233.809 --> 1240.47
kind of pushed me into embracing this

1237.169 --> 1245.989
method it's weird how that works what it

1240.47 --> 1248.809
has and so I've become really good at

1245.989 --> 1252.7
correcting myself and ensuring that my

1248.809 --> 1256.73
accidental honesty can just roam free

1252.7 --> 1258.769
much more and although I am now kind of

1256.73 --> 1262.879
like I have learned to correct for it in

1258.769 --> 1264.919
a way it took a long time to be really

1262.879 --> 1267.32
careful with certain subjects especially

1264.919 --> 1269.239
concerning the darkness but you got to

1267.32 --> 1272.389
be careful with that so I have learned

1269.239 --> 1276.169
some discipline finally but I learned to

1272.389 --> 1280.039
just be able to be honest first and

1276.169 --> 1284.1190000000001
that's how I develop it's an interesting

1280.039 --> 1287.359
combination and it's very useful I have

1284.119 --> 1290.9889999999998
to say I'm very happy with my skills I'm

1287.359 --> 1292.82
very very happy in a way all of the

1290.989 --> 1296.0900000000001
misery and all that she had have kind of

1292.82 --> 1300.559
been worth it it seems it's just that I

1296.09 --> 1302.6589999999999
have to be peaceful enough in my heart

1300.559 --> 1304.7
and clear enough in my mind to be able

1302.659 --> 1307.1000000000001
to appreciate it because when I'm

1304.7 --> 1308.57
severely distracted then all of it is

1307.1 --> 1313.029
kind of out of reach and then yeah you

1308.57 --> 1316.029
don't you just see the disadvantages in

1313.029 --> 1316.029
anyway

1322.33 --> 1325.46
[Music]

1326.39 --> 1333.95
getting sick well at root I don't think

1331.039 --> 1336.37
anything is violent at rude I think

1333.95 --> 1340.279
violence spawns from a emergency

1336.37 --> 1342.11
psychological system caused by certain

1340.279 --> 1344.45
levels of stress that cannot be coped

1342.11 --> 1347.57
with and if that mechanism is like

1344.45 --> 1352.13
overemphasized at certain ages usually

1347.57 --> 1354.71
trauma induced then that becomes the

1352.13 --> 1358.49
baseline it's like an accident

1354.71 --> 1363.6490000000001
an accidental pathway growth and it's

1358.49 --> 1366.889
very tough and yes I've been protected

1363.649 --> 1371.0
from violence a great deal I was young

1366.889 --> 1372.74
very glad of it I also didn't like it it

1371.0 --> 1376.639
was more when I became a teenager that

1372.74 --> 1379.8700000000001
yeah I started to get like very longings

1376.639 --> 1387.86
for dominance and all that and then yeah

1379.87 --> 1390.789
but I do have like I said I have the

1387.86 --> 1395.6299999999999
potential for violence it's just that I

1390.789 --> 1398.24
dislike having knowledge of hurting

1395.63 --> 1401.0590000000002
somebody else so badly because I have

1398.24 --> 1403.419
done that in the past okay not terribly

1401.059 --> 1407.1689999999999
so but I have heard people especially

1403.419 --> 1410.1200000000001
psychologically and it's like the devil

1407.169 --> 1411.8890000000001
it feels like the devil afterwards it's

1410.12 --> 1413.09
like yeah when it arrives I mean you're

1411.889 --> 1415.58
young you don't know what the [ __ ]

1413.09 --> 1419.87
you're doing but then afterwards you can

1415.58 --> 1422.029
feel like wow that was really mean you

1419.87 --> 1424.4899999999998
know and I feel guilty for that [ __ ] I

1422.029 --> 1426.74
always have even when I shouldn't when

1424.49 --> 1428.72
it's like out of pure self-defense I'm

1426.74 --> 1431.33
basically trying to block evil bluff my

1428.72 --> 1433.549
way out and then I still feel guilty

1431.33 --> 1436.1
even though the opposite groups people

1433.549 --> 1438.71
are like they totally deserved it or

1436.1 --> 1441.4089999999999
they're total dicks now it's still it's

1438.71 --> 1443.8890000000001
like the weird deception I don't know

1441.409 --> 1446.779
it's just the frequency is it's not pure

1443.889 --> 1449.87
that that's basically it's not pure and

1446.779 --> 1453.47
it rubs off and because I'm sensitive I

1449.87 --> 1455.059
can definitely detect that and if you

1453.47 --> 1458.41
can detect that then it will eventually

1455.059 --> 1461.44
just settle and start to express in

1458.41 --> 1463.8700000000001
tendencies that a person may not even

1461.44 --> 1472.66
realize but I do realize because I can

1463.87 --> 1478.32
feel the frequency always have but I

1472.66 --> 1482.74
yeah yeah I am capable of violence but

1478.32 --> 1486.84
to me it's just ultra important ultra

1482.74 --> 1489.64
important that it'll never be a tool

1486.84 --> 1493.75
yeah I will never see it as a tool it's

1489.64 --> 1496.2700000000002
I it as a mechanism that can only come

1493.75 --> 1499.45
into existence on their very specific

1496.27 --> 1502.24
conditions even if that means that I

1499.45 --> 1505.44
would have to let my life be be

1502.24 --> 1509.01
potentially threatened to some degree

1505.44 --> 1509.01
because I just

1510.45 --> 1515.999
I could imagine that for example I would

1512.97 --> 1517.8890000000001
do something violent at a time and it

1515.999 --> 1519.919
was wrong and what if people then

1517.889 --> 1523.35
suddenly chair me for it

1519.919 --> 1525.8990000000001
you know because whatever I did that

1523.35 --> 1528.6789999999999
person would be yeah would be

1525.899 --> 1533.1
potentially a criminal or whatever I

1528.679 --> 1538.98
don't know did I don't want to risk it

1533.1 --> 1542.7489999999998
so I've basically rerouted the violent

1538.98 --> 1549.21
impulses into perfected self-defense and

1542.749 --> 1555.8990000000001
quickness evasion and just seeing things

1549.21 --> 1562.109
coming so I hope I'll never have to hurt

1555.899 --> 1564.5089999999998
anyone physically ever again but yeah it

1562.109 --> 1567.389
is because I just dislike it so much it

1564.509 --> 1570.539
doesn't mean that I will not do it if I

1567.389 --> 1573.9189999999999
have no other choice and you better damn

1570.539 --> 1580.47
well believe that if I do it I will I

1573.919 --> 1583.3790000000001
will not falter for those that would

1580.47 --> 1585.619
wonder about that that's not gonna

1583.379 --> 1585.619
happen

1589.51 --> 1603.89
Yeah right right but I just see violence

1601.279 --> 1605.929
as it as a mechanism not as a tool a

1603.89 --> 1608.539
tool you can pick up and if you use the

1605.929 --> 1611.69
tool for what the tool was designed for

1608.539 --> 1613.549
yeah it works but the problem is you can

1611.69 --> 1619.49
also pick up a tool to do something else

1613.549 --> 1624.25
with it the mechanism is just a

1619.49 --> 1630.049
mechanism means it will only become

1624.25 --> 1632.679
effective in certain moments and you

1630.049 --> 1635.809
should make sure that it stays that way

1632.679 --> 1637.3400000000001
because if it arrives in other types of

1635.809 --> 1639.32
moment when it's not suited then it's

1637.34 --> 1641.24
literally disruptive and there's no use

1639.32 --> 1643.7
for it if you were I regarded like that

1641.24 --> 1650.99
and if I do it like that it works for me

1643.7 --> 1655.159
really well and yeah I can just do what

1650.99 --> 1657.23
I want to do basically and be relatively

1655.159 --> 1660.1100000000001
impulsive as long as it's guided by a

1657.23 --> 1662.39
good purpose and principles and yeah the

1660.11 --> 1666.529
worst that people can get out of me now

1662.39 --> 1669.44
is just me being really pissed off at

1666.529 --> 1671.69
somebody and well basically yeah

1669.44 --> 1675.5800000000002
offensively psychologically analyzing

1671.69 --> 1679.309
them that's like the worst I dunno

1675.58 --> 1681.86
in a way exposing them and the funny

1679.309 --> 1684.3799999999999
thing is that if other people expose

1681.86 --> 1686.08
other people like for example PJ again

1684.38 --> 1689.8400000000001
it's like oh as an agent or the

1686.08 --> 1691.58
transactional that kind of thing nobody

1689.84 --> 1693.83
cares about that because that's just a

1691.58 --> 1696.289
blank assertion no I actually in depth

1693.83 --> 1698.059
analyze and effectively expose people

1696.289 --> 1701.59
and hey if other people don't know that

1698.059 --> 1704.57
about that person they may be like yeah

1701.59 --> 1706.1
but if they do know him I may point them

1704.57 --> 1711.9189999999999
certainly at certain structures that

1706.1 --> 1714.9499999999998
were always there yeah so then these

1711.919 --> 1717.5600000000002
people will have to deal with the

1714.95 --> 1721.04
reality

1717.56 --> 1723.11
of the problems that are in them that

1721.04 --> 1726.1399999999999
are causing the disruption in the first

1723.11 --> 1729.1699999999998
place most likely because I point at it

1726.14 --> 1733.1200000000001
and that's what I do that's my offense

1729.17 --> 1733.1200000000001
that that's as far as I go these days

1738.4 --> 1743.75
and it is pretty risky to do it because

1741.74 --> 1749.06
it can be very tempting to when I'm in

1743.75 --> 1751.37
that mindset to basically dump darkness

1749.06 --> 1754.01
on it but that would ruin the whole

1751.37 --> 1756.86
effect that would immediately poison the

1754.01 --> 1760.1
[ __ ] like be basically saying kill

1756.86 --> 1762.4399999999998
yourself or that's the final yeah that's

1760.1 --> 1764.6799999999998
like the bottom line when you go there

1762.44 --> 1769.13
it's like there's no redeeming really

1764.68 --> 1772.3600000000001
you know it's like or just be really

1769.13 --> 1772.3600000000001
negative like oh [ __ ]

1772.69 --> 1780.0800000000002
just super mean-spirited that's like

1777.62 --> 1782.51
dumping darkness on somebody in such a

1780.08 --> 1785.4199999999998
situation that's not productive if you

1782.51 --> 1787.67
just point out the reality if you just

1785.42 --> 1789.8600000000001
describe the structures that are within

1787.67 --> 1792.74
them that they keep on jumping back and

1789.86 --> 1794.75
forth within then it's a whole nother

1792.74 --> 1797.48
game and that's what I do

1794.75 --> 1799.61
that's what I do to people when they

1797.48 --> 1801.82
offer step their boundaries in in my

1799.61 --> 1801.82
face

1805.43 --> 1816.71
yeah I hope you all disagree with me on

1810.8 --> 1817.85
that I disagree I hope you all agree

1816.71 --> 1822.29
with me on that

1817.85 --> 1823.76
what does definitely don't hope you all

1822.29 --> 1828.25
disagree I don't know but I'd like to

1823.76 --> 1828.25
hear what you think

1830.57 --> 1835.1399999999999
[Music]

1835.8 --> 1843.09
a good woman will shut me up no I

1840.11 --> 1847.86
certainly have to seem to be able to in

1843.09 --> 1851.76
the past so yeah yeah I need a good

1847.86 --> 1855.6
model you know I'm kind of done with

1851.76 --> 1858.39
pseudoscience models I I'm in need of an

1855.6 --> 1866.01
actual empirically provable physical

1858.39 --> 1867.8090000000002
model with some actual curves no one

1866.01 --> 1872.15
that can actually spin around its

1867.809 --> 1872.1499999999999
accident around her axis you know

1882.38 --> 1887.5500000000002
yeah I guess that the ultimate

1885.81 --> 1891.24
replacement nad that doesn't make any

1887.55 --> 1893.82
sense because right yeah I was thinking

1891.24 --> 1897.51
like the ultimate replacement for a

1893.82 --> 1904.11
baller when they lose their ball would

1897.51 --> 1905.16
be like a model dancer model lady dancer

1904.11 --> 1907.53
but they would have to have good

1905.16 --> 1919.47
curvature and then you got everything

1907.53 --> 1921.33
you lost but yeah usually at least like

1919.47 --> 1924.57
ballet dancers that are really good at

1921.33 --> 1926.9399999999998
the actual axial rotation they tend to

1924.57 --> 1930.84
be very slim and not have a lot of

1926.94 --> 1934.31
curvature cause more weight is more

1930.84 --> 1934.31
problems with that

1940.78 --> 1946.02
but yeah it's not like ballet are the

1942.909 --> 1946.0200000000002
only dancers around

1964.5 --> 1969.87
is that true I don't know get in sick

1967.65 --> 1972.63
female dancers their minds are so

1969.87 --> 1975.84
flexible is that ironic or is that

1972.63 --> 1978.21
literal I don't know I haven't dated any

1975.84 --> 1982.1999999999998
female dancers so far

1978.21 --> 1983.28
funny thing is I I am I have always been

1982.2 --> 1985.65
the dancer

1983.28 --> 1988.1399999999999
it's not so weird it's not like I am the

1985.65 --> 1991.3400000000001
gue choreographed like actual no but I

1988.14 --> 1995.97
have dance tendencies on dance floors I

1991.34 --> 1998.9399999999998
love to dance if the music is good but

1995.97 --> 2001.46
my girlfriend's usually are stand by the

1998.94 --> 2002.96
side well my ex was also that that's

2001.46 --> 2004.67
just like it doesn't really matter what

2002.96 --> 2007.55
she does she's so freaking gorgeous

2004.67 --> 2010.78
she's always gonna be good to have her

2007.55 --> 2010.78
on the dance floor and she knew it

2011.71 --> 2025.82
but like real dancers I've never dated

2014.51 --> 2030.14
any of them oh that so what music do I

2025.82 --> 2034.24
like well that's so wide but key factors

2030.14 --> 2034.24
in music is is that it is

2037.04 --> 2044.75
it is like harmonious very important no

2041.21 --> 2048.26
dissonance anyway I dislike that

2044.75 --> 2049.94
severely it's not like for some pop

2048.26 --> 2052.28
music used to do that it's like a side

2049.94 --> 2054.889
thing to get your attention I hate it so

2052.28 --> 2057.6490000000003
it has to be harmonious it has to be

2054.889 --> 2059.81
very melodic I love good complex

2057.649 --> 2062.5099999999998
melodies like that really catch my mind

2059.81 --> 2064.869
I it's like playing piano piano in my

2062.51 --> 2072.26
mind so I have a collect a lot of

2064.869 --> 2074.929
melodic oriented songs typically and if

2072.26 --> 2078.0200000000004
it has some complex multiple layer

2074.929 --> 2081.04
purple meanings in the in the what it's

2078.02 --> 2083.659
talking about I love that as well I love

2081.04 --> 2087.2599999999998
multi-dimensional meaning songs and I

2083.659 --> 2089.09
collect them as for the actual styles it

2087.26 --> 2092.4190000000003
goes all over the place I seem to be

2089.09 --> 2094.429
listening a lot of electronic that

2092.419 --> 2100.43
started out like we'd go at trance and

2094.429 --> 2103.52
then side trance and then eventually

2100.43 --> 2105.109
like what is it the dubstep entered I

2103.52 --> 2107.24
thought that was a bit interesting also

2105.109 --> 2110.0299999999997
yeah I almost forgot I was into the

2107.24 --> 2113.1499999999996
jungle before the side trance and then

2110.03 --> 2115.55
the jungle translated into drum and bass

2113.15 --> 2118.52
didn't really like that it that meant

2115.55 --> 2122.57
too simple for me not melodic enough and

2118.52 --> 2127.28
then yeah you know advanced into more

2122.57 --> 2132.8300000000004
heavy computer music like so it deep

2127.28 --> 2134.21
house and like advanced jungle and yeah

2132.83 --> 2136.22
there's been a lot of the songs through

2134.21 --> 2140.869
YouTube through very specific channel by

2136.22 --> 2142.73
the way I collected a whole lot of it so

2140.869 --> 2146.03
that I got like dubstep oriented

2142.73 --> 2152.17
electronic jungle oriented electronic

2146.03 --> 2155.27
and just really good melodic deep house

2152.17 --> 2157.96
there's some amazing freakin songs it's

2155.27 --> 2157.96
so good

2158.339 --> 2165.39
anyway that's what I really love now in

2163.589 --> 2167.759
the Gothic sea Knight I used to listen a

2165.39 --> 2169.949
lot to it mind in a box which is also

2167.759 --> 2172.41
very much electro although it is still a

2169.949 --> 2174.539
little bit more retro or it I like retro

2172.41 --> 2179.64
electro as well

2174.539 --> 2182.1890000000003
I don't like heavy beat music a lot but

2179.64 --> 2184.68
I can listen to it if the good Malati

2182.189 --> 2192.359
good melody accompanies it then I will

2184.68 --> 2194.64
enjoy it let's see yeah I also like

2192.359 --> 2198.119
classic but I don't listen to it very

2194.64 --> 2199.89
often but I have the sensitivity for it

2198.119 --> 2201.9590000000003
so the classic is just very special

2199.89 --> 2204.18
there's something unique about classical

2201.959 --> 2207.5989999999997
instrument there's a magic to it it's

2204.18 --> 2207.8089999999997
palpable my mother had it and she knew

2207.599 --> 2210.1090000000004
it

2207.809 --> 2212.369
yes she's she was professional

2210.109 --> 2216.42
professionals can get she was a teacher

2212.369 --> 2218.6600000000003
and in a band and composer and all that

2216.42 --> 2220.9790000000003
joy yeah a classical composer she knew

2218.66 --> 2222.1189999999997
that power she talked about it with me

2220.979 --> 2224.7889999999998
even when there was a little kid I

2222.119 --> 2226.7090000000003
always was extremely inspired by it cuz

2224.789 --> 2231.289
I was very interested in magical things

2226.709 --> 2237.3289999999997
as a young kid and so was she anyway

2231.289 --> 2240.65
classical music folk I like classical

2237.329 --> 2243.6600000000003
folk especially Irish folk but there's

2240.65 --> 2246.179
interesting elements about a lot of

2243.66 --> 2249.029
classical music in different cultures

2246.179 --> 2251.579
I like Eastern classic has some really

2249.029 --> 2255.239
interesting melodic of things in it and

2251.579 --> 2257.849
even typical Middle Eastern music very

2255.239 --> 2261.479
fascinating type of they have their

2257.849 --> 2268.1600000000003
typical thing they do but some of it is

2261.479 --> 2268.16
like really like magical but I think and

2269.39 --> 2276.209
it's just so much music that is really

2273.15 --> 2279.63
amazing so I like a lot of classical I

2276.209 --> 2282.39
like folk I like electro good electro

2279.63 --> 2287.039
and and airy and everything is always

2282.39 --> 2290.069
centered around good melody for me yeah

2287.039 --> 2293.719
talk about a a folk song that is really

2290.069 --> 2293.719
folk it's not from a typical

2293.81 --> 2297.06
yeah

2295.14 --> 2299.16
somebody that always does that's the

2297.06 --> 2302.7
style of music because I do know them

2299.16 --> 2304.62
like for example a stumpy German band

2302.7 --> 2306.8999999999996
that all make their own freakin

2304.62 --> 2308.8199999999997
instruments it's all classes really old

2306.9 --> 2311.07
medieval instruments and they do all

2308.82 --> 2313.2000000000003
kinds of folk music from all over the

2311.07 --> 2316.17
world all kinds of styles it's credible

2313.2 --> 2317.8799999999997
I loved it still go guy I saw that life

2316.17 --> 2320.9700000000003
a couple of times it was really amazing

2317.88 --> 2325.08
but a good song that one of the first

2320.97 --> 2330.24
exposures I had to Irish style folk it's

2325.08 --> 2334.34
a song from Kate Bush from the from the

2330.24 --> 2338.64
album for the city the ninth wave and

2334.34 --> 2342.03
it's called the jig of life and it has a

2338.64 --> 2344.2799999999997
very complex folk melody that I can lit

2342.03 --> 2346.17
I know it by heart I can sing the whole

2344.28 --> 2349.9100000000003
thing and it's freaking complicated and

2346.17 --> 2352.29
I love it I love it so much just really

2349.91 --> 2352.6499999999996
into that song every time I hear it's

2352.29 --> 2357.27
just

2352.65 --> 2363.32
yeah dijiye gets me it's like just get

2357.27 --> 2366.83
in this trance I love it hasn't changed

2363.32 --> 2371.07
yeah I've never really been into that

2366.83 --> 2372.84
into the rock too much I've always been

2371.07 --> 2376.8
like yeah it's okay

2372.84 --> 2378.36
but I don't listen to it like I don't

2376.8 --> 2380.2200000000003
mind parties when there's like rock

2378.36 --> 2382.9700000000003
performances or rock music so yeah

2380.22 --> 2387.2599999999998
that's fine some of it is really cool

2382.97 --> 2387.2599999999998
but I don't listen to it

2390.65 --> 2398.329
I don't think I really even listen to

2393.92 --> 2400.599
bands anymore in general just listen to

2398.329 --> 2400.599
songs

2420.17 --> 2425.7400000000002
Oh God you're getting a timeout for that

2429.79 --> 2436.94
no no I don't I definitely don't like

2434.09 --> 2439.1800000000003
and never have like NSYNC thank you very

2436.94 --> 2439.18
much

2440.17 --> 2451.73
like that's one of the first bands that

2443.18 --> 2454.94
really made me hate pop music just

2451.73 --> 2460.31
hearing that [ __ ] over the radio oh my

2454.94 --> 2464.23
god so annoying I'm glad I don't have to

2460.31 --> 2464.23
anymore I don't have to listen to that

2468.13 --> 2474.9100000000003
Greg more colors well most singers don't

2470.6 --> 2478.49
even sing you know bands are now more

2474.91 --> 2481.46
surrounding looks and stage performance

2478.49 --> 2482.0299999999997
because the cell just freakin equalizing

2481.46 --> 2484.76
[ __ ]

2482.03 --> 2486.86
you know it's all about the spirit now

2484.76 --> 2490.82
it's all about can you dance a bit can

2486.86 --> 2493.34
you be cool he look cool because you

2490.82 --> 2495.77
don't really need to sing anymore you

2493.34 --> 2497.9900000000002
know it's it's it could be like a thing

2495.77 --> 2499.64
like oh wow a music performer that can

2497.99 --> 2502.7299999999996
actually sing Wow

2499.64 --> 2505.22
in a way it funny enough because now all

2502.73 --> 2507.62
these people use equalizing voice

2505.22 --> 2510.43
equalizers and all that nonsense people

2507.62 --> 2513.7999999999997
that can actually sing and don't do that

2510.43 --> 2515.72
it becomes almost special now it's like

2513.8 --> 2522.3500000000004
wow that called everyone can actually

2515.72 --> 2524.7799999999997
sing well yeah 20 years ago if you

2522.35 --> 2528.68
couldn't sing you wouldn't you wouldn't

2524.78 --> 2530.51
be doing thats as simple as that and not

2528.68 --> 2533.24
everybody will has had great stage

2530.51 --> 2539.03
charisma some were just good at the mute

2533.24 --> 2542.33
at the music and they and then like a

2539.03 --> 2544.4
popular band or whatever itself

2542.33 --> 2546.7999999999997
grassroots band would at least have to

2544.4 --> 2549.29
have an appealing singer or something

2546.8 --> 2552.25
that is good at stage stuff and then the

2549.29 --> 2555.619
rest would just be doing

2552.25 --> 2557.0
their craft but now we add the whole

2555.619 --> 2561.369
game has changed with all the

2557.0 --> 2561.369
electronics everything's different now

2562.94 --> 2565.9790000000003
[Music]

2590.61 --> 2598.17
right let earth spaceman well modern

2594.03 --> 2601.8300000000004
music being so sucky is basically what

2598.17 --> 2606.36
has created completely created the retro

2601.83 --> 2608.79
scene and now even the mainstream is

2606.36 --> 2612.36
latching on to the retro scene because

2608.79 --> 2616.29
they've basically failed in their assert

2612.36 --> 2619.98
in their systems in their plans doesn't

2616.29 --> 2622.86
work people do think it sucks or they

2619.98 --> 2624.86
will eventually think it sucks so a lot

2622.86 --> 2628.71
of people go into retro and even

2624.86 --> 2630.9
youngsters think it's like okay this is

2628.71 --> 2636.98
kind of old and cookie and it's kind of

2630.9 --> 2641.0
yeah retro but still it's yeah it's fine

2636.98 --> 2644.97
it's better than some of the overhyped

2641.0 --> 2648.27
over equalized noisy attention-grabbing

2644.97 --> 2651.48
[ __ ] you know different youngsters may

2648.27 --> 2654.54
recognize that so yeah the retro has

2651.48 --> 2656.85
become a thing because the new creations

2654.54 --> 2659.0099999999998
the new change the new culture shift

2656.85 --> 2661.14
that they attempted to put through for a

2659.01 --> 2666.15
long time and that's basically reached

2661.14 --> 2668.04
it's it's psychotic point it's failed

2666.15 --> 2669.75
it's failed to basically rub off

2668.04 --> 2672.18
properly although yeah there's still

2669.75 --> 2676.05
plenty of people going crazy because of

2672.18 --> 2683.75
its general influence because of its the

2676.05 --> 2683.75
railing placements suggestions

2684.439 --> 2692.269
information placement and hyper

2687.719 --> 2692.2690000000002
suggestive concepts

2698.93 --> 2705.94
who thank you almost made me ban you you

2702.349 --> 2705.94
know that symbol is forbidden right

2711.0 --> 2714.179
[Music]

2733.07 --> 2744.67
hmm no dank it's okay it's just that

2738.59 --> 2744.67
that symbol is literally his trademark

2745.27 --> 2750.41
so you gotta be careful with that [ __ ]

2747.71 --> 2754.48
it's that you have a wrench because if

2750.41 --> 2754.48
you haven't I probably instantly ban you

2760.03 --> 2764.9900000000002
yeah

2762.81 --> 2770.57
I did read the sentence though and do

2764.99 --> 2770.5699999999997
indeed happy non concave week

2775.24 --> 2781.8999999999996
[Music]

2778.12 --> 2785.47
oh god he is dank I just blocked him

2781.9 --> 2787.0
I literally not room just blocked him

2785.47 --> 2790.0299999999997
from my chat but just blocked him so I

2787.0 --> 2792.46
never have to see him again and that way

2790.03 --> 2793.9500000000003
because he does literally spam

2792.46 --> 2797.2
everywhere

2793.95 --> 2799.39
this guy is life like a living billboard

2797.2 --> 2802.12
for his own religion and he does nothing

2799.39 --> 2806.92
else I think he literally does this just

2802.12 --> 2810.91
all day long just doing the concave

2806.92 --> 2813.04
billboard [ __ ] all day long you know I

2810.91 --> 2815.71
almost start to wonder like is he an

2813.04 --> 2818.23
agent because he definitely does seem to

2815.71 --> 2820.18
have an agenda because typical

2818.23 --> 2824.22
advertisement without research

2820.18 --> 2826.93
development is typically shield behavior

2824.22 --> 2832.56
so it's like he's a concave Sheila so

2826.93 --> 2835.7799999999997
who what is there a plan for a concavity

2832.56 --> 2838.0299999999997
made that could that be a potential

2835.78 --> 2840.1000000000004
agenda there seems to be a lot of crazy

2838.03 --> 2844.36
people involved in that like even the

2840.1 --> 2847.74
Lord Stephen Christ it's a yeah proven

2844.36 --> 2853.81
criminal and he supposedly is such a

2847.74 --> 2856.7799999999997
frontman for this all so maybe the

2853.81 --> 2862.86
concave earth is an agenda is one of is

2856.78 --> 2866.71
a plant I don't know I wonder from who

2862.86 --> 2870.6400000000003
could be the Nazis they did talk about

2866.71 --> 2873.2200000000003
all our earth and all that I don't know

2870.64 --> 2875.7999999999997
the Nazis do they even exist is there

2873.22 --> 2879.6099999999997
even still an agenda or just a bunch of

2875.8 --> 2882.1000000000004
people following that ideology kind of a

2879.61 --> 2884.34
secret and talking about it with one

2882.1 --> 2887.3199999999997
another and bragging

2884.34 --> 2890.08
is there something real with it is there

2887.32 --> 2894.67
a real driving agency I don't think so

2890.08 --> 2896.7999999999997
really at this one it's yeah I think

2894.67 --> 2900.03
most of it is all just a false flag

2896.8 --> 2900.03
concept now you know

2904.039 --> 2914.869
but anyway I just think that yeah that

2909.029 --> 2918.689
guy Jason I think he really is it does

2914.869 --> 2921.779
have tags that typically correlate with

2918.689 --> 2924.749
agency it's something that I tried to

2921.779 --> 2929.219
address PJ on like do you even know what

2924.749 --> 2932.3689999999997
an agent is what agency is he from what

2929.219 --> 2934.199
is the agenda how do you recognize the

2932.369 --> 2935.909
narrative how do you know it's an agent

2934.199 --> 2938.219
he just didn't even know how to respond

2935.909 --> 2940.529
it's so dumb it's like people aren't so

2938.219 --> 2941.939
no agents it's the agents he doesn't

2940.529 --> 2945.109
even know what a freaking agent is

2941.939 --> 2948.6299999999997
there's a couple of ideas but he he has

2945.109 --> 2950.549
no sensibility about he can't actually

2948.63 --> 2953.9390000000003
analyze people and figure out if their

2950.549 --> 2956.759
agents know he's just tagging it you

2953.939 --> 2958.859
know it's just like the whole shield

2956.759 --> 2960.419
nonsense I have all those people calling

2958.859 --> 2968.189
other shields they don't know what a

2960.419 --> 2970.979
freaking shield is it's so dumb I have

2968.189 --> 2974.939
paid attention to agents

2970.979 --> 2977.1299999999997
it's fascinating like yeah it's kind of

2974.939 --> 2978.569
well known that for example in the Alex

2977.13 --> 2981.449
Jones Show it's one of the things I find

2978.569 --> 2987.089
itself fascinating for is that if he's

2981.449 --> 2992.639
had self-admitted CIA people on there

2987.089 --> 2996.749
and national security and that means

2992.639 --> 2999.119
they are agents they're public agents

2996.749 --> 3002.1789999999996
but that means that they are tagged into

2999.119 --> 3003.369
a narrative that's what they do that's

3002.179 --> 3006.199
how it works

3003.369 --> 3009.139
it always does that means they can have

3006.199 --> 3013.939
their own free story but that free story

3009.139 --> 3018.199
must be placed in a certain line the

3013.939 --> 3020.3889999999997
agency's narrative and I detect for it i

3018.199 --> 3022.699
watch like how much freedom do they have

3020.389 --> 3024.469
what do what do they have to stick to

3022.699 --> 3026.179
how do you recognize it when they do

3024.469 --> 3027.589
something that you really don't like to

3026.179 --> 3030.649
do because that's a sign that there's

3027.589 --> 3033.109
agency driving them in this factor that

3030.649 --> 3033.88
kind of thing and they train to mask it

3033.109 --> 3037.39
by the way

3033.88 --> 3040.32
so it's a real challenge but yeah that's

3037.39 --> 3045.1
kind of helped me a little bit in

3040.32 --> 3047.7400000000002
recognizing what agencies are what

3045.1 --> 3051.31
agency narrative is and I don't know

3047.74 --> 3054.2799999999997
it's still very fresh for me it took a

3051.31 --> 3060.1
long time to even figure it out that I

3054.28 --> 3064.75
could do that but yeah I'm getting

3060.1 --> 3067.12
better at it it is basically almost like

3064.75 --> 3070.63
detective work just like what I said

3067.12 --> 3076.45
about pointing at the factors concerning

3070.63 --> 3078.46
the concerning Jason like what does he

3076.45 --> 3084.96
do what does that mean

3078.46 --> 3084.96
and then why would he just do that and

3085.92 --> 3093.61
right now yeah I know I do it for myself

3090.37 --> 3095.62
and it's I don't know what other people

3093.61 --> 3097.4500000000003
do they may think they may kind of be

3095.62 --> 3100.75
following the same type of pattern but

3097.45 --> 3103.0299999999997
they will yeah people are very have

3100.75 --> 3105.76
these vast tendencies to just over

3103.03 --> 3108.76
generalize everything it's a big problem

3105.76 --> 3115.2400000000002
and in trying to critically think your

3108.76 --> 3117.01
way through things anyway

3115.24 --> 3122.9799999999996
it's a challenge you know critical

3117.01 --> 3128.32
thought isn't easy never is that's the

3122.98 --> 3130.089
whole point anyone can think what to

3128.32 --> 3132.07
critically think it's always a challenge

3130.089 --> 3133.68
because this usually forces out there

3132.07 --> 3137.92
that oppose it

3133.68 --> 3140.47
there are demons that will arrive now

3137.92 --> 3142.839
demons will also arrive if you literally

3140.47 --> 3147.58
throw out your own demons and other

3142.839 --> 3148.81
demons will come to face it so it

3147.58 --> 3151.48
doesn't mean that if you just go

3148.81 --> 3153.46
Savannah all day long that you're do you

3151.48 --> 3155.53
got it right because somebody's opposing

3153.46 --> 3162.82
you know that's not that in the

3155.53 --> 3165.0400000000004
slightest it's not the same thing but if

3162.82 --> 3168.73
you've got something really right and

3165.04 --> 3170.32
you don't have to agitate people to get

3168.73 --> 3172.18
your point across you can just point it

3170.32 --> 3174.9300000000003
out and then people got triggered then

3172.18 --> 3179.3489999999997
you know you got a critical thought

3174.93 --> 3182.02
because there's people get yeah demons

3179.349 --> 3184.42
are triggering there's a right arrival

3182.02 --> 3187.45
of darkness from the other side even

3184.42 --> 3189.25
though you would be calm and that's how

3187.45 --> 3191.5
you know you got critical thought

3189.25 --> 3193.599
because if you're just gonna say things

3191.5 --> 3197.65
agitating or say things to agitate

3193.599 --> 3199.54
specifically then that effect will

3197.65 --> 3201.88
probably not arrive to the same level

3199.54 --> 3204.31
you will just get negative counter

3201.88 --> 3206.56
response so that is not effective

3204.31 --> 3209.14
you're not critically thinking when you

3206.56 --> 3211.54
do that it you could just think of it as

3209.14 --> 3213.2799999999997
it and some people do and it's a mistake

3211.54 --> 3217.38
it's wrong it's not critical thinking at

3213.28 --> 3217.38
all Savan yeh it's very annoying

3220.41 --> 3227.91
so yeah critical thought not to

3224.91 --> 3233.94
recognize it true critical thought

3227.91 --> 3235.799
usually causes trigger thanks a men a

3233.94 --> 3237.809
young for the ten dollar shoot you had

3235.799 --> 3239.91
the nation thanks a lot of our window

3237.809 --> 3244.349
thank you thank you for always being

3239.91 --> 3246.529
there on the show and thank you for

3244.349 --> 3246.529
moderating

3254.85 --> 3260.43
alright okay Ivan fencing yeah I read

3258.36 --> 3269.51
about that and heard about it the Joe

3260.43 --> 3271.7
Rogan and Bernie Sanders God the Bernie

3269.51 --> 3276.84
what a character

3271.7 --> 3279.33
he's I if the situation wasn't basically

3276.84 --> 3285.11
so serious I would just think he's like

3279.33 --> 3285.11
one of the funniest guys ever this is oh

3285.35 --> 3292.92
really

3286.47 --> 3296.93
dang thanks I'll check it out I can't

3292.92 --> 3296.9300000000003
really use it I mean really

3302.46 --> 3313.98
ah Thank You Man yeah thank you for the

3305.64 --> 3321.6299999999997
10 euro thank you thank you so much yeah

3313.98 --> 3323.73
let's dent regular contributor yeah

3321.63 --> 3327.079
it's financially saved my neck a couple

3323.73 --> 3333.569
of times now together with some other

3327.079 --> 3336.21
individuals that also donate but yeah

3333.569 --> 3338.69
he's been one of the first so thanks

3336.21 --> 3338.69
again dank

3343.49 --> 3346.39
right

3347.63 --> 3358.1600000000003
hmm yeah that was good thank you man see

3353.859 --> 3362.509
15 more minutes to go yeah it is a good

3358.16 --> 3364.999
conversation so far uh hide it maybe

3362.509 --> 3370.599
it's the blue look just look at the how

3364.999 --> 3376.009
frickin blue that is I mean that is blue

3370.599 --> 3379.039
look at it I don't see that very often

3376.009 --> 3382.64
anymore something that the sky being

3379.039 --> 3386.4790000000003
that bright blue it's beautiful I miss

3382.64 --> 3388.269
it I love that color it's not even a

3386.479 --> 3391.1899999999996
color it's just like a light

3388.269 --> 3394.0389999999998
distribution in its Sun based and it is

3391.19 --> 3400.489
holographic like I've been realizing

3394.039 --> 3406.46
that even just the color off the sky

3400.489 --> 3409.569
during the day is purely because of the

3406.46 --> 3412.279
sunlight and because the sunlight is

3409.569 --> 3414.049
basically the Sun is holographic it's

3412.279 --> 3416.089
not it's not an electro position it's

3414.049 --> 3418.91
all based on the surface that means that

3416.089 --> 3424.099
all the colors you get to see in the sky

3418.91 --> 3428.479
the day sky that that palette is

3424.099 --> 3431.989
basically also holographic that color

3428.479 --> 3433.489
all of it what you see is purely visual

3431.989 --> 3438.979
exactly like that

3433.489 --> 3441.349
only to you because it is that color

3438.979 --> 3446.74
because of the sunlight pretty damn I'm

3441.349 --> 3450.1090000000004
sure it is you know that's yeah

3446.74 --> 3452.54
the world is surreal and amazing it

3450.109 --> 3456.0499999999997
might be looping but at least

3452.54 --> 3458.21
yeah the heavens the globe of the

3456.05 --> 3461.9300000000003
heavens seems very much holographic and

3458.21 --> 3464.39
on every every conceivable way it's very

3461.93 --> 3467.2999999999997
confusing very triggering to a lot of

3464.39 --> 3471.7
people or they just start to cackle out

3467.3 --> 3471.7000000000003
of control when they first hear it and

3473.319 --> 3479.93
yeah then there's the looping potential

3476.599 --> 3484.27
of the realm that the realm would be a

3479.93 --> 3487.19
self confined loop looping space now

3484.27 --> 3490.27
I've how long I've been talking about

3487.19 --> 3492.859
this three years or more maybe four and

3490.27 --> 3494.24
every time I bring it up it's there's

3492.859 --> 3499.339
been people out there that have been

3494.24 --> 3502.819
hearing me say that for years on a

3499.339 --> 3505.88
regular basis and those people still

3502.819 --> 3507.619
don't get it even though I've pretty

3505.88 --> 3509.1800000000003
much tried to explain it in every

3507.619 --> 3510.98
conceivable way maybe they just don't

3509.18 --> 3513.859
get it because they don't want to get it

3510.98 --> 3516.069
because they don't want to entertain

3513.859 --> 3521.2999999999997
that space not may not be linear

3516.069 --> 3525.47
completely they they find it and

3521.3 --> 3528.71
unacceptable if maybe they feel like it

3525.47 --> 3531.6189999999997
would drive them psychotic because if

3528.71 --> 3535.7
you're used to everything being exactly

3531.619 --> 3538.4
as is very solid and all that in every

3535.7 --> 3543.02
way then that gives some comfort to give

3538.4 --> 3546.89
some rest for me in a way my view of the

3543.02 --> 3549.68
world is so so real that it is extremely

3546.89 --> 3552.98
restless but because I'm so immersed in

3549.68 --> 3557.93
it and I'm trusting the way I approach

3552.98 --> 3562.7
it so well I'm very confident that helps

3557.93 --> 3565.2799999999997
me to not be stressed out by the surreal

3562.7 --> 3568.97
nature of what I think it's probably

3565.28 --> 3571.19
yeah it will turn out to be because I'm

3568.97 --> 3574.2799999999997
just constantly exposed to it I'm

3571.19 --> 3577.91
thinking like that a lot I can think the

3574.28 --> 3580.6400000000003
other ways but I've just mastered

3577.91 --> 3582.5
that break that that realization

3580.64 --> 3585.41
physicality assumption bias based on the

3582.5 --> 3587.87
globe of the heavens and then figuring

3585.41 --> 3591.08
out like wait space may not be linear

3587.87 --> 3593.99
that's another surreal factor and then

3591.08 --> 3597.16
who knows where it will go from there on

3593.99 --> 3599.6
you know like the big mystery what is

3597.16 --> 3602.96
what is at the bottom the absolute

3599.6 --> 3607.1
bottom what is at the top the absolute

3602.96 --> 3609.7400000000002
top could you make a hole through the

3607.1 --> 3615.02
entire earth and then literally fall

3609.74 --> 3618.02
eternally because literally just no

3615.02 --> 3622.64
that's but that's just a mind experiment

3618.02 --> 3624.98
little yeah portals remember from the

3622.64 --> 3627.1099999999997
computer game portals yeah

3624.98 --> 3629.57
could turn out to be just that don't

3627.11 --> 3632.65
know for sure though doesn't seem very

3629.57 --> 3636.05
likely in some ways but it could be

3632.65 --> 3639.4100000000003
because if there is a loop in one way

3636.05 --> 3644.42
then it becomes much more likely that

3639.41 --> 3647.7799999999997
it's all looping like once you open that

3644.42 --> 3652.31
door as a possibility then to just use

3647.78 --> 3654.77
it on everything as a designer seems not

3652.31 --> 3657.41
far-fetched if that could be possible

3654.77 --> 3659.93
technically and hey if it could be

3657.41 --> 3662.5899999999997
technically possible then it's likely it

3659.93 --> 3666.1099999999997
was done because yeah it's the creator

3662.59 --> 3669.17
and the Creator likes to make a

3666.11 --> 3671.54
challenge for people because otherwise

3669.17 --> 3675.98
people get bored and they'll just start

3671.54 --> 3678.41
to go to baseline behavior people need a

3675.98 --> 3682.4
challenge so the challenge is inherent

3678.41 --> 3684.6099999999997
in the design of it all hmm how about

3682.4 --> 3684.61
that

3692.41 --> 3696.94
like everything we do everything we

3694.749 --> 3703.0589999999997
figure out every piece of engineering

3696.94 --> 3708.369
every concept it's all secondary the the

3703.059 --> 3713.19
creator it's mind is mine the thing out

3708.369 --> 3717.7000000000003
there I'm presuming it is has a mind it

3713.19 --> 3720.789
thought everything and then when it

3717.7 --> 3724.269
thought everything that's the design it

3720.789 --> 3729.88
chose and so every thought we follow

3724.269 --> 3731.7099999999996
every realization we have it's all the

3729.88 --> 3737.8900000000003
Creator already thought it every thought

3731.71 --> 3741.64
we ever had everything because that's

3737.89 --> 3745.89
how he made it he thought of it all and

3741.64 --> 3749.17
then he made it for us to follow him to

3745.89 --> 3751.8689999999997
follow in his footsteps it's kind of

3749.17 --> 3754.66
again back to the Christ analogy it's

3751.869 --> 3757.63
like yeah we follow his path but in a

3754.66 --> 3759.7
way metaphorically spiritually we

3757.63 --> 3762.7000000000003
literally follow in the path of the

3759.7 --> 3767.3999999999996
Creator as in his in the following in

3762.7 --> 3772.049
the thoughts every thought we get

3767.4 --> 3772.049
originally was thought of by the Creator

3774.71 --> 3781.4900000000002
and the design reveals every aspect and

3778.43 --> 3784.97
that's how we follow in the footsteps of

3781.49 --> 3788.9599999999996
the mind of the creator by revealing the

3784.97 --> 3794.6299999999997
truth of the design see see how

3788.96 --> 3798.67
esoterics suddenly makes the things tie

3794.63 --> 3798.67
in it's pretty interesting

3802.45 --> 3805.2
you know

3805.25 --> 3816.079
never never exclude esoteric so when it

3810.95 --> 3822.1699999999996
comes to yeah the bigger analogies never

3816.079 --> 3825.349
it's always important in my view because

3822.17 --> 3828.109
I think that in retrospect most

3825.349 --> 3832.4
religions are founded upon esoterics

3828.109 --> 3834.2599999999998
because they are the truths they are the

3832.4 --> 3837.7400000000002
information then those truths are

3834.26 --> 3841.1600000000003
eventually concealed coded in exoteric

3837.74 --> 3842.8689999999997
in symbols and then in rituals performed

3841.16 --> 3845.81
and then the people lose track of what

3842.869 --> 3848.81
those rituals really mean and then it

3845.81 --> 3853.5099999999998
becomes all exoteric it all just becomes

3848.81 --> 3856.49
ritual and and symbols and things and

3853.51 --> 3858.619
people within it will not necessarily

3856.49 --> 3859.7599999999998
have spiritual wisdom they will not have

3858.619 --> 3862.46
the insight because they won't even

3859.76 --> 3864.7400000000002
understand what they're doing and what

3862.46 --> 3866.65
it all stands for necessarily because

3864.74 --> 3870.56
then that's not part of what they do

3866.65 --> 3873.38
some of them may but that's ein that a

3870.56 --> 3876.14
religion is extremely exoteric well

3873.38 --> 3879.349
esoterics is what it was all built on

3876.14 --> 3881.69
what the symbols and all it the meanings

3879.349 --> 3884.44
were actually what you get to see where

3881.69 --> 3892.19
it was derived from that's the exoteric

3884.44 --> 3894.8
things always follow esoterics and in

3892.19 --> 3897.5
the early stages this is very apparent

3894.8 --> 3900.05
it's very clear in the early stages when

3897.5 --> 3902.2
when religion is just founded when it's

3900.05 --> 3904.579
coming when it gets momentum when strong

3902.2 --> 3907.97
when it's not imperialize not

3904.579 --> 3909.9500000000003
politicized yet the people that are

3907.97 --> 3912.56
basically effectively the priests that

3909.95 --> 3916.3689999999997
uphold the the brightest light of it

3912.56 --> 3919.609
they fend off exoteric ideas they say

3916.369 --> 3922.9100000000003
like no we're not gonna do that [ __ ] no

3919.609 --> 3925.79
you don't add on exoteric elements

3922.91 --> 3928.16
because that only distract from the

3925.79 --> 3930.38
spiritual core of it from the esoterics

3928.16 --> 3932.39
that's what they do originally well yeah

3930.38 --> 3935.3
these still people and eventually people

3932.39 --> 3937.4
will still die and then others may take

3935.3 --> 3939.3500000000004
on that same notion and try to

3937.4 --> 3941.9300000000003
defend the esoteric against the exoteric

3939.35 --> 3945.3199999999997
but eventually those types of people

3941.93 --> 3947.54
will at some point run out or suddenly

3945.32 --> 3951.44
some attack from foreigners and devils

3947.54 --> 3954.56
and they will then use that for their

3951.44 --> 3958.91
own political machinations and make it

3954.56 --> 3961.7599999999998
esoteric as a hostile act take over a

3958.91 --> 3964.46
group than the religion that was

3961.76 --> 3967.01
esoteric just becomes completely

3964.46 --> 3969.71
effectively muddied up with exoteric and

3967.01 --> 3972.6800000000003
then becomes a political device for the

3969.71 --> 3973.4900000000002
conquering force yeah and I think that's

3972.68 --> 3976.85
what happened

3973.49 --> 3980.6299999999997
also with Islam in pretty early stage

3976.85 --> 3984.73
and despite that there's still some good

3980.63 --> 3987.23
in there but it's just very deeply

3984.73 --> 3990.61
concealed on their giant layers of

3987.23 --> 3998.36
Pharisee power abuse and and dark

3990.61 --> 3999.8
control so yeah that's my my talk for

3998.36 --> 4001.9900000000002

3999.8 --> 4004.8300000000004
