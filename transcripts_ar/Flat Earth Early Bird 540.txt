194.37 --> 213.63
new guy I think yeah welcome to my show

198.41 --> 223.2
basically Aquaman okay hello right what

213.63 --> 224.85
have I been doing yesterday again I

223.2 --> 230.69
think I've been watching the series

224.85 --> 233.24
again that was talking about a lot a lot

230.69 --> 239.31
just as much as the day before

233.24 --> 243.51000000000002
Goodridge and yeah it is it is an

239.31 --> 249.3
interesting little series to me for

243.51 --> 252.29999999999998
several reasons it's something to keep

249.3 --> 255.78
me busy also although yeah pretty much

252.3 --> 260.19
every criticism that came before

255.78 --> 264.09
it's interesting how like it the serie

260.19 --> 268.95
unfolds very very step by step it's like

264.09 --> 271.79999999999995
a playbook as to how things unfold and

268.95 --> 276.27
it's it's almost kind of cookie cutter

271.8 --> 279.15000000000003
it's weird and yeah there's certain

276.27 --> 281.13
things that come up it the interesting

279.15 --> 286.46999999999997
thing about it and I thought it was at

281.13 --> 289.83
first kind of know I don't donate to my

286.47 --> 294.45000000000005
paypal right now right now basically I

289.83 --> 296.90999999999997
come in right now it will cost me what

294.45 --> 301.169
is it 80 euros if you don't ain't Nate

296.91 --> 303.63000000000005
that the full amount I will get the

301.169 --> 304.44
microphone arm I'll get it this

303.63 --> 306.57
afternoon

304.44 --> 310.26
no wait that's impossible I'll get it

306.57 --> 316.5
Monday and I'll have it within the week

310.26 --> 318.419
promise you right but it wasn't my first

316.5 --> 320.85
priority but hey if you want me to get

318.419 --> 321.56
that thing then you donate to me right

320.85 --> 324.99
now

321.56 --> 327.45
it's as simple as that alright so I've

324.99 --> 331.02
been continuing watching the series good

327.45 --> 334.49
the Good Witch and there are some

331.02 --> 338.76
interesting elements to it it's become

334.49 --> 344.03000000000003
like they do get some darker stuff in

338.76 --> 346.92
there but they still sweeten it up a lot

344.03 --> 349.04999999999995
but it's it the funny thing about it is

346.92 --> 351.36
that the way the whole series and the

349.05 --> 354.86
magic of it is present it's super

351.36 --> 358.35
moderate it is

354.86 --> 360.6
let's just say my to my personal opinion

358.35 --> 362.55
every single thing that kind of happens

360.6 --> 366.93
in there that could be considered

362.55 --> 369.75
magical or witchy or it's all absolutely

366.93 --> 371.46
real and possible every single thing

369.75 --> 375.45
I've come across in there so far it's

371.46 --> 379.10999999999996
nothing is like ooh Harry Potter is

375.45 --> 382.59
nonsan no it's all things that are

379.11 --> 384.81
absolutely possible it's fascinating

382.59 --> 389.76
because they they even kind of like draw

384.81 --> 393.32
in or cultish people that dip oh and the

389.76 --> 396.96
occult it's it really in many ways is a

393.32 --> 401.82
very accurate reflection of how it all

396.96 --> 403.68
really works at that aspect so that's

401.82 --> 406.5
kind of what grabbed my attention is

403.68 --> 408.96
that they the weird thing is that it was

406.5 --> 411.06
tagged as among the like they always

408.96 --> 414.51
tagged things with three words and was

411.06 --> 417.0
like family drama and fantasy

414.51 --> 420.39
really so what's that fantasy so far I

417.0 --> 425.97
haven't really seen any fantasy because

420.39 --> 431.69
the magic is all absolutely yeah within

425.97 --> 435.54
the lines of how that works it was funny

431.69 --> 438.24
to feel that afterward anyway I'm not

435.54 --> 441.71000000000004
done with the whole series yet it still

438.24 --> 444.02
has a lot of elements to it that

441.71 --> 445.82
but I find it fascinating so that yeah

444.02 --> 450.44
that's what I'm doing right now it has

445.82 --> 453.139
not a [ __ ] to do with Flat Earth the

450.44 --> 457.669
series is definitely not Bible approved

453.139 --> 460.34000000000003
and they loft a dragon like look at the

457.669 --> 470.69
ancient Egypt thing so it is absolutely

460.34 --> 472.60999999999996
like I said New Age Pagan themed the

470.69 --> 474.68
whole thing and basically there's not a

472.61 --> 479.27000000000004
single mention of the word Christ of in

474.68 --> 482.419
any sort of way or even or even God

479.27 --> 486.04999999999995
they just attributed to the universe the

482.419 --> 488.33
will of the Union it's typical at it and

486.05 --> 492.199
it kind of rubs me the wrong way at that

488.33 --> 498.62
element because if I for example compare

492.199 --> 500.33000000000004
it to my stepmother she yeah she's kind

498.62 --> 504.65
of in the same theme but she absolutely

500.33 --> 511.94
does understand Christ she's just not

504.65 --> 514.87
really preoccupied with that now I

511.94 --> 517.76
haven't Aquaman

514.87 --> 520.539
now the go fund me was altered into

517.76 --> 524.48
something else and then I shut it down

520.539 --> 530.75
if I had some kind of money from that

524.48 --> 532.3100000000001
golf on me then yeah it spent on the

530.75 --> 535.779
other thing that it changed to because

532.31 --> 542.54
it was the same well fund me as of the

535.779 --> 544.52
the p900 that's what it was so since

542.54 --> 548.48
you're not gonna donate you can piss the

544.52 --> 551.4399999999999
[ __ ] off out of my chat now stupid troll

548.48 --> 551.44
piece of [ __ ]

553.63 --> 563.68
right but anyone else out there willing

558.97 --> 567.0690000000001
to help me out that's there will be

563.68 --> 571.5999999999999
great and of course thanks all the loyal

567.069 --> 574.81
supporters that that ya can make

571.6 --> 582.339
complaints if they want you know they

574.81 --> 584.529
don't have to be afraid but yeah these

582.339 --> 587.259
trouble guys yeah they can just piss the

584.529 --> 599.319
hell out of my chat because nobody needs

587.259 --> 602.38
you here yeah don't worry about it guys

599.319 --> 605.11
it's just the stupid R and T trolls that

602.38 --> 607.899
I call them ran T trolls because they

605.11 --> 610.269
are probably tied into that [ __ ]

607.899 --> 613.29
although you'll absolutely deny

610.269 --> 613.29
everything about it

615.87 --> 621.819
because as soon as I would say you know

618.819 --> 625.079
what I think that sleeping warrior might

621.819 --> 628.149
have overstepped his bounds and this

625.079 --> 632.17
needlessly attacking the poor for on T

628.149 --> 635.439
that's caught up in weird circumstances

632.17 --> 639.7299999999999
in its yeah yeah and then they'll stop

635.439 --> 643.0
whining because that is all that this is

639.73 --> 646.24
about that's the only thing why people

643.0 --> 648.37
are whining about all these yeah PayPal

646.24 --> 653.189
donations in the past and my go fund me

648.37 --> 653.189
that's the only reason they're doing it

655.139 --> 661.889
it's so deeply pathetic really

663.32 --> 670.24
it's it's just it's like politics like

667.43 --> 673.91
they're caught up in this sub social

670.24 --> 677.33
circle politics and they get there just

673.91 --> 681.41
as fanatical as is freaking liberal

677.33 --> 693.1800000000001
idiots but for even a more useless

681.41 --> 696.29
reason it's pretty sick amen you

693.18 --> 696.29
[Music]

699.91 --> 707.41
right Jim Jones

703.78 --> 714.85
look I this is not entirely true hey if

707.41 --> 716.8299999999999
I get their Nations then you know there

714.85 --> 720.49
is some accountability there of course

716.83 --> 723.85
and I do my best to do that but yeah

720.49 --> 725.6800000000001
that's also why I have been over the

723.85 --> 727.96
year pretty much after I've been

725.68 --> 729.8199999999999
monetized just realizing like what how

727.96 --> 731.4100000000001
that really works the consequences also

729.82 --> 735.21
the karmic consequence the social

731.41 --> 739.66
consequences of just this money donation

735.21 --> 742.9000000000001
situation and for myself to be able to

739.66 --> 745.0
handle that to not be incredibly

742.9 --> 748.26
embarrassed or like nervous or get

745.0 --> 750.91
paranoid over it seriously because

748.26 --> 753.73
before I even had my channel

750.91 --> 756.1899999999999
there was its the Savannah a [ __ ]

753.73 --> 757.87
that oh if you're if you're taking money

756.19 --> 760.0
it's a secret cabal thing it's

757.87 --> 763.63
whitewashing of blah blah blah

760.0 --> 767.08
conspiracy you know yeah and I was kind

763.63 --> 769.99
of susceptible to that at first till I

767.08 --> 772.6600000000001
got to know people that are like on the

769.99 --> 774.3100000000001
internet actually doing things and

772.66 --> 776.92
getting money for it and then figured

774.31 --> 781.0
out no no it's that's not what this is

776.92 --> 787.3
and then yeah I kind of became part of

781.0 --> 790.06
it as a yeah a decision yeah basically

787.3 --> 796.24
to get it to do this sort of semi

790.06 --> 797.17
professionally and yeah not saying that

796.24 --> 798.99
I'm very good at it

797.17 --> 806.9499999999999
not saying that I'm very professional

798.99 --> 809.59
but I try to be persistent at least but

806.95 --> 812.5600000000001
yeah now what I do with my money it

809.59 --> 815.89
depends on what I asked it for to and

812.56 --> 817.9599999999999
now I just asked regularly like please

815.89 --> 820.66
guys support me please help me out with

817.96 --> 823.69
some PayPal donations it is basically

820.66 --> 827.02
begging but at the same time yeah it

823.69 --> 831.9100000000001
keeps me going and I have something to

827.02 --> 833.769
do and to offer so it's not like it's

831.91 --> 840.429
literally in a hole and there's

833.769 --> 842.769
no effective change because of that or

840.429 --> 845.529
rather it's the prevent of negative

842.769 --> 847.9590000000001
change because if I just get nothing

845.529 --> 852.22
then I'll get into financial trouble get

847.959 --> 853.149
very distracted and fooled away forced

852.22 --> 858.489
to do something else

853.149 --> 862.66
oh that's very nice that's very very

858.489 --> 866.649
nice you do that because I am very open

862.66 --> 868.54

1145.31 --> 1153.47
I'm a purist okay in many ways and

1148.42 --> 1158.15
they're definitely just polluted and I

1153.47 --> 1163.28
don't like that yeah Thank You Amanda

1158.15 --> 1166.63
young I know I guess I do have a lot of

1163.28 --> 1172.31
fans even though it often eludes me why

1166.63 --> 1177.8300000000002
really I wish I would get it a little

1172.31 --> 1179.9299999999998
better like I wish I could see more like

1177.83 --> 1183.56
what the thing is that is so great about

1179.93 --> 1187.6000000000001
me because in a way I the only thing

1183.56 --> 1191.6
that I really focus on is just trying to

1187.6 --> 1195.1399999999999
not let my mind take control and like

1191.6 --> 1200.1789999999999
start just chiseling I'm only from the

1195.14 --> 1202.94
inside out really just trying to pick

1200.179 --> 1204.669
what comes out but it's all just natural

1202.94 --> 1210.5800000000002
wave pulses with me

1204.669 --> 1214.22
it's literally mostly subconscious like

1210.58 --> 1216.71
where yeah I busy myself almost like

1214.22 --> 1218.299
translating for another person that's

1216.71 --> 1221.3890000000001
what my consciousness seems to be

1218.299 --> 1223.7
busying I just have ideas and those

1221.389 --> 1226.279
ideas de Gaulle go all over the place

1223.7 --> 1227.96
there's a ya giant framework that have

1226.279 --> 1230.269
built off my entire life it's so big

1227.96 --> 1234.799
it's like out of my control even that

1230.269 --> 1237.22
big and I just need ya try to figure out

1234.799 --> 1240.259
you know where to go next and then start

1237.22 --> 1244.58
explaining things as much of it as I can

1240.259 --> 1245.72
that's what I do a lot sometimes people

1244.58 --> 1247.6999999999998
get a little sick of it

1245.72 --> 1250.789
especially on the Flat Earth debates and

1247.7 --> 1253.6390000000001
then yeah all the times it's like yay

1250.789 --> 1257.059
every time I say something and then

1253.639 --> 1260.4799999999998
they're like yeah and other times it's

1257.059 --> 1262.999
like no response whatsoever and like

1260.48 --> 1265.039
what it's did somebody here did you guys

1262.999 --> 1268.1290000000001
hear me that's why I say that sometimes

1265.039 --> 1269.809
like what did you guys hear me because

1268.129 --> 1276.4699999999998
there's no response and I don't get that

1269.809 --> 1278.72
like I don't that's very like are they

1276.47 --> 1281.179
waiting for me to say more was that

1278.72 --> 1285.23
statement not complete enough to their

1281.179 --> 1288.74
satisfaction these are questions that

1285.23 --> 1291.32
are sometimes on my mind just in my

1288.74 --> 1293.24
interactions on the debate I always have

1291.32 --> 1294.9189999999999
a lot of questions on my mind when I

1293.24 --> 1303.49
interact with in groups with other

1294.919 --> 1306.0800000000002
people a lot like out of the ordinary oh

1303.49 --> 1308.869
by the way thank you rocky alive for the

1306.08 --> 1310.61
90 dollar ninety nine super cheddar

1308.869 --> 1313.789
nation watching Harry you go through

1310.61 --> 1319.129
your walk of truth is refreshing you

1313.789 --> 1320.84
keep me around really huh Oh am i okay

1319.129 --> 1326.74
you just figured out how to send money

1320.84 --> 1330.6299999999999
through what should I check in damn

1326.74 --> 1333.73
sheesh what just a couple of trolls oh

1330.63 --> 1340.1490000000001
wow yeah you did thank you so much it

1333.73 --> 1342.76
yeah five year old 37 thank you so much

1340.149 --> 1346.4499999999998
ma'am I'm it's raining it's raining

1342.76 --> 1355.299
money today yeah that straw should come

1346.45 --> 1360.659
by more often and complain it's not even

1355.299 --> 1363.37
that they like intimidate me really or

1360.659 --> 1366.0100000000002
in a way it's almost like yeah they do

1363.37 --> 1369.399
confront me with things that are kind of

1366.01 --> 1371.23
like morally slightly dubious but in the

1369.399 --> 1375.1299999999999
wide earth scheme of things they're

1371.23 --> 1377.14
really accounted for so for me every

1375.13 --> 1380.5590000000002
time they try to throw me is almost like

1377.14 --> 1383.74
I have to respond because it's like an

1380.559 --> 1386.62
opportunity I see it as an opportunity

1383.74 --> 1389.59
on my show that is because I can't just

1386.62 --> 1392.1999999999998
take my time to put something down in

1389.59 --> 1394.299
response and sure and literally diffuse

1392.2 --> 1398.26
every aspect of what they said on the

1394.299 --> 1405.82
spot in every way intellectually

1398.26 --> 1407.4089999999999
emotionally spiritually so yeah it's

1405.82 --> 1409.3899999999999
kind of annoying though when it gets

1407.409 --> 1411.6100000000001
kind of spammy that that's really or

1409.39 --> 1416.71
when everybody else starts to grow

1411.61 --> 1419.529
silent then it's kind of annoying but

1416.71 --> 1423.7
yeah man thank you so much everyone I'm

1419.529 --> 1426.58
a UK rikiya life dank Amanda young of

1423.7 --> 1429.3700000000001
course always and Guns of Navarone

1426.58 --> 1431.4089999999999
I repeat very generous is definitely

1429.37 --> 1434.77
gonna help me I'm still gonna have to

1431.409 --> 1435.8200000000002
sit through a what is it a a bit of a

1434.77 --> 1438.85
dry Sunday

1435.82 --> 1441.37
I think but that's just because of the

1438.85 --> 1443.649
flow because I don't think that the

1441.37 --> 1445.6589999999999
PayPal from like yesterday it's gotta

1443.649 --> 1454.32
arrive today it's probably all just

1445.659 --> 1454.3200000000002
gonna get there Monday but I'll survive

1454.62 --> 1461.35
and then after that definitely all right

1458.86 --> 1464.1999999999998
so yeah one little weird side story of

1461.35 --> 1467.62
my personal life again is that I kind of

1464.2 --> 1472.18
did get some beer yesterday almost like

1467.62 --> 1475.4799999999998
it it was like a tryout to figure out if

1472.18 --> 1477.0700000000002
it really worked the way I thought it

1475.48 --> 1478.93
did like how things change

1477.07 --> 1483.07
and the weird thing was it did like

1478.93 --> 1487.0900000000001
immediately I just didn't like it it was

1483.07 --> 1490.06
so weird I had just two beers and like

1487.09 --> 1492.84
after the first one I kind of like drank

1490.06 --> 1497.1699999999998
the second one because I just kind of

1492.84 --> 1501.97
pushed myself to but it just it's not

1497.17 --> 1506.98
the same it's like so changed so I don't

1501.97 --> 1508.57
need that for a while in a way it's

1506.98 --> 1512.44
almost disappointing I like I want that

1508.57 --> 1515.1699999999998
the other effect right back but it's not

1512.44 --> 1519.19
gonna come from it and I'm not gonna be

1515.17 --> 1521.5900000000001
a fool myself into like mind fool yeah

1519.19 --> 1523.3
tricking like pretending like it does

1521.59 --> 1530.28
because it doesn't right now so it's

1523.3 --> 1530.28
just yeah 23 years that's a long time

1531.0 --> 1542.89
all right with me I just try to go with

1536.65 --> 1546.75
the tides but it's gonna be good just

1542.89 --> 1546.75
not to drink for a while

1549.07 --> 1558.1699999999998
just drink tea a lot when I don't drink

1554.36 --> 1565.01
a beer I do drink a lot more tea and

1558.17 --> 1570.02
also coffee if I don't watch out hmm Wow

1565.01 --> 1578.39
since 98 that's incredible man it's a

1570.02 --> 1587.93
completely sober completely sober new

1578.39 --> 1589.4
millennium for you that yeah that's

1587.93 --> 1594.71
right yeah that's that's my thought

1589.4 --> 1597.89
exactly dang it's like if you get

1594.71 --> 1600.26
trapped by it if it if it yeah if you

1597.89 --> 1603.2
become alcoholic in some way starting

1600.26 --> 1605.12
with like habit things usually if you

1603.2 --> 1607.55
get trapped and it's not actually

1605.12 --> 1610.37
yielding the joy it should then it's

1607.55 --> 1612.1399999999999
like a detriment but if you can manage

1610.37 --> 1616.28
it if you can like fight the right

1612.14 --> 1619.01
moments for it and then also stop for a

1616.28 --> 1622.19
long times after that again then it

1619.01 --> 1624.47
could be an absolute blessing but I

1622.19 --> 1626.51
guess that for a lot of people it's

1624.47 --> 1629.57
pretty difficult to do that not

1626.51 --> 1637.67
everybody has the inner talent to deal

1629.57 --> 1641.03
with it like that hmm you okay yeah

1637.67 --> 1642.65
that's yeah you hated the taste and I

1641.03 --> 1645.74
would make me feel so I just stopped

1642.65 --> 1647.7800000000002
drinking well that's so weird because

1645.74 --> 1651.08
that's kind of like what it was

1647.78 --> 1653.99
yesterday too like it didn't taste right

1651.08 --> 1655.76
I was almost like err is there something

1653.99 --> 1659.06
polluted in there it's like it didn't

1655.76 --> 1661.46
taste right anymore and it it didn't

1659.06 --> 1665.99
make me feel like it made me feel like

1661.46 --> 1669.19
it kept stuck in my belly made me feel

1665.99 --> 1673.22
kind of bloated it didn't do anything

1669.19 --> 1677.42
like it did pretty much up until a week

1673.22 --> 1679.31
ago so yeah I can imagine if others only

1677.42 --> 1684.71
know that effect that just absolutely

1679.31 --> 1690.83
not worth it the swine count Adam Egan

1684.71 --> 1693.02
uh I don't know I haven't drank wine in

1690.83 --> 1695.72
a while because in the time that I

1693.02 --> 1700.25
typically like beer wine tends to have

1695.72 --> 1703.31
bad effects on me weird I'm potentially

1700.25 --> 1708.26
try it are you are you trying to get me

1703.31 --> 1711.32
back on the alcohol is alcoholic Arwen

1708.26 --> 1723.44
more pleasurable I guess that I do get a

1711.32 --> 1726.07
little less snidey when I drink it does

1723.44 --> 1726.0700000000002
softened me up

1726.73 --> 1735.68
red wine very good in moderation yeah

1730.22 --> 1736.43
yeah potentially but yeah it's the

1735.68 --> 1740.51
moderation

1736.43 --> 1746.0
you know even with wine it's kind of

1740.51 --> 1748.7
tough like for me just having that

1746.0 --> 1756.05
bottle of wine and just saying I'll just

1748.7 --> 1759.53
have one glass yeah well when if it

1756.05 --> 1761.69
feels good then it's gonna be poppin

1759.53 --> 1765.59
it's gonna pop in my mind like wow what

1761.69 --> 1768.76
if I take a second one and then after

1765.59 --> 1773.3899999999999
that I probably wouldn't take more or

1768.76 --> 1776.39
maybe I would but to just stick to that

1773.39 --> 1781.1000000000001
one glass man that that's something that

1776.39 --> 1783.7
I've never really yeah that was always

1781.1 --> 1783.6999999999998
very tough

1784.31 --> 1797.3899999999999
I rubbed Wiggles right yeah well with me

1794.0 --> 1800.53
that issue that I don't know when to

1797.39 --> 1803.8100000000002
stop was kind of always naturally offset

1800.53 --> 1805.96
due to my physical intolerance of

1803.81 --> 1809.4199999999998
alcohol in the sense that I would get

1805.96 --> 1810.53
drunk relatively quick and that that's

1809.42 --> 1813.5600000000002
always been like that

1810.53 --> 1817.34
always and after a certain point I just

1813.56 --> 1819.32
get sick every single time it's just so

1817.34 --> 1821.12
much only so much I can take and it's

1819.32 --> 1823.8799999999999
really not that much when other people

1821.12 --> 1827.27
hear that they're like what really ah ha

1823.88 --> 1829.16
that's funny you know I I need to drink

1827.27 --> 1831.95
all that just before I start to feel

1829.16 --> 1835.3300000000002
something in my pinky so at that I'm

1831.95 --> 1837.77
absolutely not Legolas

1835.33 --> 1845.36
unless of course Legolas was just

1837.77 --> 1847.67
completely bluffing it's kind of funny

1845.36 --> 1850.07
too because in in Dungeons & Dragons in

1847.67 --> 1853.5500000000002
the game I always actually have a lower

1850.07 --> 1855.32
Constitution on average so they do get

1853.55 --> 1857.6
more easily drunk it's so funny how that

1855.32 --> 1860.0
works out but I guess that Legolas is

1857.6 --> 1864.4699999999998
just the ultimate awesome in everything

1860.0 --> 1868.49
he's like a legendary cowboy elf like

1864.47 --> 1870.89
that you know that's that concept it's

1868.49 --> 1874.78
like the the cowboy super somebody

1870.89 --> 1874.7800000000002
that's just perfect and everything I

1875.95 --> 1884.21
think that that concept that hero

1880.49 --> 1886.78
concept started with westerns just

1884.21 --> 1890.17
somebody that's just unreasonably good

1886.78 --> 1890.17
at everything

1892.55 --> 1899.06
combat wise and all that anyway and

1896.36 --> 1901.78
drinking and playing cards of course in

1899.06 --> 1905.36
westerns but yeah there's no cards and

1901.78 --> 1907.8799999999999
oh at least well there probably would be

1905.36 --> 1911.86
some cards in the Lord of the Ring

1907.88 --> 1911.8600000000001
universe it just never really came out

1927.78 --> 1936.42
hmm okay you do drink yeah zero alcohol

1933.24 --> 1940.97
beer all right all right if you like

1936.42 --> 1946.44
that I would never do that

1940.97 --> 1949.38
no because I don't like the taste of

1946.44 --> 1952.05
beer that much I only like it when

1949.38 --> 1955.0500000000002
there's alcohol in it for me it's weird

1952.05 --> 1958.1399999999999
it's like the first beer it's really the

1955.05 --> 1961.19
anti pick anticipation of the alcohol

1958.14 --> 1963.8700000000001
that makes it like better tasting and

1961.19 --> 1966.27
then afterward when there's some alcohol

1963.87 --> 1968.1899999999998
effective then it starts to really taste

1966.27 --> 1970.02
good so yeah that's that effect could

1968.19 --> 1972.03
never be achieved for me with the

1970.02 --> 1977.28
alcohol free beer so it's just I don't

1972.03 --> 1984.0
like the taste of beer really not just

1977.28 --> 1984.99
the the brew itself but hey if you like

1984.0 --> 1991.41
it that's great

1984.99 --> 1993.03
why not yeah for people that just like

1991.41 --> 1994.92
the taste of beer it's great that

1993.03 --> 1997.47
there's alcohol-free beer like that

1994.92 --> 2001.6000000000001
although I would be careful with the

1997.47 --> 2004.76
brand I would approach for that because

2001.6 --> 2008.87
especially like in the the huge mega

2004.76 --> 2011.93
corporation type beer brands it's not

2008.87 --> 2012.6499999999999
just alcohol that can be detrimental in

2011.93 --> 2021.5600000000002
those drinks

2012.65 --> 2024.8600000000001
so be careful with that white Claus good

2021.56 --> 2027.56
well that that that used to be big bears

2024.86 --> 2032.24
on Benjamin's favorite beer brand I've

2027.56 --> 2036.2
never heard of that we don't have any of

2032.24 --> 2042.01
that in Europe I've never seen it maybe

2036.2 --> 2042.01
some mega stores that I've never been in

2042.55 --> 2049.96
like alcohol big stores but I I never

2047.0 --> 2053.27
really go there they don't have enough I

2049.96 --> 2055.73
usually just want my organic beer and

2053.27 --> 2057.89
they're they're available at the

2055.73 --> 2059.72
supermarket they do the supermarket has

2057.89 --> 2062.679
like the organic supermarket it's like

2059.72 --> 2066.5299999999997
all the whole range of beers is like

2062.679 --> 2068.36
five now that doesn't sound like a lot

2066.53 --> 2071.0600000000004
of it like five different brands that

2068.36 --> 2083.4500000000003
have a whole variety of types of beers

2071.06 --> 2089.98
each brand so plenty to choose from this

2083.45 --> 2094.97
is your part Hobgoblin are you a GM well

2089.98 --> 2101.84
I don't know that's kind of funny that

2094.97 --> 2105.8599999999997
you would say that I'm not necessarily

2101.84 --> 2108.6200000000003
going to disagree with you if you

2105.86 --> 2115.67
understand how hobgoblins really are in

2108.62 --> 2118.25
the dungeon dragons universe I don't

2115.67 --> 2122.9
know if they would be your tighter like

2118.25 --> 2125.83
hobgoblins are very militaristic in

2122.9 --> 2125.83
dungeon dragons

2129.099 --> 2140.63
Hobgoblin is a beer okay I didn't know

2136.07 --> 2143.1090000000004
that he had a meeting of course you

2140.63 --> 2143.109
should have known

2161.13 --> 2166.5
right so maybe you should like talk

2164.19 --> 2170.39
about something else as beer it's not

2166.5 --> 2170.39
really a good morning conversation

2173.45 --> 2179.91
ladies understand sugar and alcohol yeah

2176.16 --> 2181.92
so do I you know when I like a few days

2179.91 --> 2183.87
ago when I kind of like stopped drinking

2181.92 --> 2186.77
the first thing I noticed is that I got

2183.87 --> 2189.81
more hungry it's like hmm

2186.77 --> 2192.53
yeah the beers that I take they are kind

2189.81 --> 2192.5299999999997
of like a meal

2204.16 --> 2212.7799999999997
okay Missouri bear bear says I only

2208.22 --> 2216.0499999999997
drink 12 to 24 year old scotch for

2212.78 --> 2218.36
celebration I've turned into an old

2216.05 --> 2230.6600000000003
fuddy-duddy who tells the kids to get

2218.36 --> 2233.8900000000003
off my lawn okay yeah good servant Jim

2230.66 --> 2233.89
Jones is a gem

2247.54 --> 2253.7799999999997
oh don't worry Hosea we're not afraid I

2251.1 --> 2262.71
don't think anybody is afraid of you at

2253.78 --> 2262.71
this one maybe more repulsed

2271.91 --> 2279.7599999999998
[Music]

2294.19 --> 2297.19
hmm

2301.14 --> 2306.43
yeah yeah they still haven't returned

2303.79 --> 2310.42
the go to channel function I don't

2306.43 --> 2316.83
understand why they did that it's such a

2310.42 --> 2316.83
huge detriment huge detriment

2340.54 --> 2347.04
I really wish you to purchase for store

2343.24 --> 2347.04
D go to channel function it's

2356.52 --> 2363.99
or I don't know you know if they if they

2359.85 --> 2366.5099999999998
insist on not doing that beat because

2363.99 --> 2370.41
for example they had trouble with too

2366.51 --> 2371.67
many people opening too many channels

2370.41 --> 2374.94
just to check it out if that's

2371.67 --> 2378.02
supposedly the problem then I don't know

2374.94 --> 2382.53
replace it by another way to identify it

2378.02 --> 2384.48
maybe if you could just like in that bar

2382.53 --> 2388.6800000000003
see for example how many subscribers

2384.48 --> 2391.38
they had that would already fix a lot

2388.68 --> 2396.8999999999996
then you could identify them by

2391.38 --> 2402.03
subscriber amount if going to that

2396.9 --> 2405.69
channel is the problem right if if

2402.03 --> 2408.42
YouTube insists on not letting people do

2405.69 --> 2411.08
that and it's probably a very bad reason

2408.42 --> 2414.9900000000002
why they would want that not to be done

2411.08 --> 2417.5099999999998
but then at least give the the moderator

2414.99 --> 2419.8799999999997
function that was essential it was

2417.51 --> 2421.7400000000002
essential to go to be able to do that to

2419.88 --> 2426.0
go to channel to check out if somebody's

2421.74 --> 2429.0299999999997
the real them then just replace it by an

2426.0 --> 2431.43
identifier that just lets you instantly

2429.03 --> 2434.52
shows in the drop-down menu when you

2431.43 --> 2437.79
click on it how many subscribers they

2434.52 --> 2440.49
have because that will immediately tell

2437.79 --> 2443.91
you if it's a fake sock or not they have

2440.49 --> 2446.0699999999997
like 0 or 1 or 23 subscribers and it's a

2443.91 --> 2448.71
channel that you know roughly how many

2446.07 --> 2451.98
subscribers they have seed fixed can you

2448.71 --> 2454.9700000000003
please do something about it YouTube for

2451.98 --> 2454.97
[ __ ] sake man

2475.98 --> 2487.37
no no all right

2488.62 --> 2495.62
really gonna engage with Jose you need

2493.91 --> 2502.69
you know that guy is just not

2495.62 --> 2502.69
accountable for anything he says right

2509.28 --> 2515.88
the guy is a compulsive liar in the

2513.51 --> 2518.67
sense that he needlessly makes promises

2515.88 --> 2522.62
and then breaks them right after for

2518.67 --> 2526.23
everyone to see he's like a compulsive

2522.62 --> 2528.21
promise-breaker it's kind of close to

2526.23 --> 2531.17
pathological liar but it's slightly

2528.21 --> 2535.67
different and that's Jose

2531.17 --> 2540.05
yeah Jose sorry it's the truth

2535.67 --> 2542.85
that's what you've done it's not about

2540.05 --> 2550.01
what you believe in it's about how you

2542.85 --> 2553.65
acted there's no need for any of that

2550.01 --> 2556.38
you being defiant in the face of rules

2553.65 --> 2557.19
of just normal code of conduct honor and

2556.38 --> 2559.5
all that [ __ ]

2557.19 --> 2562.28
there is no reason for you to break it

2559.5 --> 2564.96
even if you think that Nathan may be

2562.28 --> 2566.9700000000003
unreasonably treating you yeah welcome

2564.96 --> 2570.38
to the freaking Club okay I feel like

2566.97 --> 2574.3799999999997
that too sometimes but guess what

2570.38 --> 2576.84
it's his freakin show you the whole

2574.38 --> 2582.12
puzzle is to learn to deal with it

2576.84 --> 2586.5
like even rhombus knows how to deal with

2582.12 --> 2588.62
it because he keeps coming back so he

2586.5 --> 2592.05
personally knows how to deal with it

2588.62 --> 2597.18
without all for stepping his boundaries

2592.05 --> 2599.5800000000004
more than usual because rumpus yeah like

2597.18 --> 2602.5499999999997
his machinations are such high level

2599.58 --> 2603.12
that like lying becomes like essential

2602.55 --> 2606.09
to it

2603.12 --> 2608.46
yeah it's he's no longer accountable to

2606.09 --> 2610.83
that sense like he is such a religious

2608.46 --> 2612.84
fanatic at what he does that he's just

2610.83 --> 2615.63
no longer accountable in that sense I

2612.84 --> 2621.81
know he pretends to be but you on the

2615.63 --> 2624.7200000000003
other hand you you just say things like

2621.81 --> 2629.7599999999998
hey yeah that's okay I'm not recording

2624.72 --> 2634.41
anything and then you do it you record

2629.76 --> 2639.0600000000004
it anyway and you don't ask permission

2634.41 --> 2642.23
or anything it's it's just no it's code

2639.06 --> 2642.23
of conduct breaking

2643.09 --> 2647.8900000000003
it's not good buddy sorry

2654.09 --> 2657.1490000000003
[Music]

2680.73 --> 2687.14
right serious truth yeah well that's

2683.16 --> 2690.93
because these people are very disgusting

2687.14 --> 2693.15
homoerotic lis obsessed with Nathan it's

2690.93 --> 2695.46
because Nathan touches them in a way

2693.15 --> 2700.109
that they've never experienced before

2695.46 --> 2702.66
and it unveils the homoerotic nature in

2700.109 --> 2706.65
these people by the words that they

2702.66 --> 2711.24
speak constantly because I guess Nathan

2706.65 --> 2713.6600000000003
reveals how gay they really are how

2711.24 --> 2713.66
about that

2731.52 --> 2735.81
right buddy they hate them because he

2733.89 --> 2739.92
touches them in a way that they don't

2735.81 --> 2743.46
want to be they he breaks their safe

2739.92 --> 2745.619
space in a way that's kind of a Humpty

2743.46 --> 2748.92
Dumpty effect and they're just sitting

2745.619 --> 2754.59
there like but I want to forget about

2748.92 --> 2756.66
him but every time he pops up in some

2754.59 --> 2760.1400000000003
way and then they get all obsessed over

2756.66 --> 2762.75
it and spend all day long just dedicated

2760.14 --> 2768.15
like blind staring hoping that they can

2762.75 --> 2772.74
somehow get him to burst or make him

2768.15 --> 2774.69
sick of everything and then stop it well

2772.74 --> 2776.91
I wish you the best luck with that

2774.69 --> 2781.14
because that shit's been going down for

2776.91 --> 2783.96
years now and I think that Nathan's

2781.14 --> 2790.83
is probably enjoying himself even more

2783.96 --> 2792.42
than he used to in the sense that I did

2790.83 --> 2794.67
sense that he's become more sadistic

2792.42 --> 2797.55
towards bothersome for good reason of

2794.67 --> 2801.51
course because yeah he's had to endure

2797.55 --> 2806.6600000000003
just levels of disgusting manipulative

2801.51 --> 2810.5400000000004
liars and just hide in plain sight

2806.66 --> 2812.3999999999996
doublespeak lying like beyond even

2810.54 --> 2814.83
supposed to the globe's versus Flat

2812.4 --> 2818.73
Earth argumentations and yeah you get

2814.83 --> 2821.64
pretty pissed off with people that keep

2818.73 --> 2824.01
on doing that to you when you try to get

2821.64 --> 2825.5099999999998
serious like with me I don't even get

2824.01 --> 2830.5800000000004
serious like that anymore

2825.51 --> 2831.9900000000002
it's like I just laugh at it literally

2830.58 --> 2834.42
you might have noticed like I'd

2831.99 --> 2838.3799999999997
literally just laugh at it's like wow

2834.42 --> 2841.4700000000003
there is so [ __ ] delusional I'm just

2838.38 --> 2845.4
gonna laugh cuz I know there's just

2841.47 --> 2849.0
nothing like these people would probably

2845.4 --> 2854.6
die for their [ __ ] religion okay they

2849.0 --> 2854.6
would die for it it's that bad

2856.37 --> 2862.35
so yeah what what that means that I'm

2860.22 --> 2864.8999999999996
gonna be pissed off and are you gonna

2862.35 --> 2868.11
stop and we do we good stop them from

2864.9 --> 2871.7400000000002
being delusional idiots asserting the

2868.11 --> 2876.65
most ridiculous nonsensical garbage ever

2871.74 --> 2879.6499999999996
to come out of pseudo-intellectual mouth

2876.65 --> 2879.65
ever

2886.61 --> 2894.2000000000003
oh really Jose your to talk you know you

2890.63 --> 2898.2400000000002
don't you're a liar and you self admit

2894.2 --> 2901.3399999999997
you've admitted that you're too dumb

2898.24 --> 2906.9799999999996
okay you literally admit it for being

2901.34 --> 2911.02
too dumb to understand logical trains of

2906.98 --> 2916.48
thought and consequences to actual

2911.02 --> 2919.87
science and optics research

2916.48 --> 2923.33
you literally admitted you're too dumb

2919.87 --> 2927.7999999999997
so yeah you don't have to psychoanalyze

2923.33 --> 2929.77
me concerning projection here I'm pretty

2927.8 --> 2933.5
certain about my case I'm very careful

2929.77 --> 2935.3
you know my biggest issue really since I

2933.5 --> 2938.15
was on YouTube and since I've engaged in

2935.3 --> 2941.09
the flat earth is not to get too hungry

2938.15 --> 2949.58
for honor because there's a lot of that

2941.09 --> 2951.6800000000003
I gotta just sell down that I have to my

2949.58 --> 2955.1
own satisfaction accomplished very

2951.68 --> 2957.58
little but at the same time that's my

2955.1 --> 2961.97
own satisfaction and that's focused on a

2957.58 --> 2963.74
specific region while excluding a whole

2961.97 --> 2966.1
lot of other influences that other

2963.74 --> 2973.16
people apparently do appreciate me for

2966.1 --> 2976.75
right yeah you're a troll such a great

2973.16 --> 2981.43
troll and I know and I am notorious for

2976.75 --> 2985.73
fully responding to the fullest extent

2981.43 --> 2989.66
beyond anything your troll as action

2985.73 --> 2994.06
expectations could conceive by not

2989.66 --> 2997.1299999999997
getting trolled but just taking it as

2994.06 --> 2999.44
literal as possible and as honest and

2997.13 --> 3002.38
pure as possible take away that entire

2999.44 --> 3008.9700000000003
veneer of oh I'm funny I'm special and

3002.38 --> 3008.9700000000003
just responding for real yeah

3011.42 --> 3016.86
yeah yeah yeah you're a very

3013.62 --> 3019.95
self-imposing guy that really loves to

3016.86 --> 3024.6200000000003
declare what you want to be that's right

3019.95 --> 3024.62
doesn't make it so though you know

3025.64 --> 3031.17
there's very little people fooled by it

3028.65 --> 3035.76
it's usually the ones that are just that

3031.17 --> 3037.92
don't wanna think anymore

3035.76 --> 3041.0
they'll probably believe you because you

3037.92 --> 3045.2400000000002
do have like oh yeah I'm so charming oh

3041.0 --> 3048.39
I'm such a charming exotic man and very

3045.24 --> 3049.9799999999996
I can look like I'm very smart

3048.39 --> 3053.6099999999997
I don't know why I didn't got the

3049.98 --> 3056.31
Russian in there but I don't know you do

3053.61 --> 3059.61
that in your own way you're kind of good

3056.31 --> 3062.2999999999997
at the act but it is an act you can see

3059.61 --> 3065.4300000000003
right through it I can literally just

3062.3 --> 3068.28
cut through your eyes as you do that

3065.43 --> 3070.8199999999997
[ __ ] on camera and see right through the

3068.28 --> 3073.02
act and a lot of people probably can

3070.82 --> 3075.32
well yeah a lot of people that follow

3073.02 --> 3079.53
you either don't give a [ __ ] anymore or

3075.32 --> 3082.02
they're just too numb to see it and

3079.53 --> 3084.7200000000003
that's all fine because you have your

3082.02 --> 3087.69
crowd and I have my crowd I like to

3084.72 --> 3093.41
actually educate my crowd and get very

3087.69 --> 3096.39
strict in class and I like try to detect

3093.41 --> 3102.6299999999997
bad behavior in people and then almost

3096.39 --> 3105.92
like well push them to correct it and I

3102.63 --> 3108.36
guess they do come for here in the way

3105.92 --> 3111.03
so the first like people were very

3108.36 --> 3116.6600000000003
resentful at that they were like no they

3111.03 --> 3123.2400000000002
don't tell me but now yeah people get

3116.66 --> 3124.92
why I do that they get it it's like an

3123.24 --> 3132.24
opportunity it's an opportunity to

3124.92 --> 3134.6
prayer purify to condense to become

3132.24 --> 3134.6
better

3136.27 --> 3146.99
more than the sum of your parts no no

3142.339 --> 3152.349
Bobby Micawber I am completely that's

3146.99 --> 3152.3489999999997
just I don't care at all at all

3153.88 --> 3159.619
stupid rabble tests I don't give a [ __ ]

3156.29 --> 3161.63
I'm probably very bad at this moment

3159.619 --> 3164.589
because I'm not engaged in a lot of

3161.63 --> 3166.849
calculus activity that that would

3164.589 --> 3169.25
definitely improve my skill if the

3166.849 --> 3173.049
problem is is that I just don't care at

3169.25 --> 3178.19
all like at all at this point I'm like

3173.049 --> 3183.71
well that's just garbage and it's just

3178.19 --> 3186.29
luxury garbage really quickness no no no

3183.71 --> 3189.069
I'm much more prefer to just dabble in

3186.29 --> 3194.359
pure intuition has nothing to do

3189.069 --> 3198.65
anything IQ related you can't measure

3194.359 --> 3200.3289999999997
that [ __ ] except little through EQ test

3198.65 --> 3203.69
although that's just like a wet finger

3200.329 --> 3206.6600000000003
work as well on long run you know so no

3203.69 --> 3209.38
not interested in IQ test in this

3206.66 --> 3209.3799999999997
lightest

3213.97 --> 3218.75
and I know I said some things about it

3216.829 --> 3222.02
in the past and then when you say

3218.75 --> 3224.72
certain things that a lot of people then

3222.02 --> 3227.21
it's like you kick them in the balls and

3224.72 --> 3231.74
they'll never forget it's like how dare

3227.21 --> 3234.349
you declare to have an IQ how dare you

3231.74 --> 3236.6899999999996
because you're a flat earther and you're

3234.349 --> 3239.3590000000004
politically designated by my religion to

3236.69 --> 3243.309
be a [ __ ] [ __ ] so you cannot

3239.359 --> 3246.47
possibly have an IQ above the average

3243.309 --> 3248.48
that's the mindset that drives people to

3246.47 --> 3251.3289999999997
constantly say that [ __ ] in chat

3248.48 --> 3255.73
it's like doing the cutest it's so

3251.329 --> 3261.92
important it's so important oh my god

3255.73 --> 3264.68
it's so important you can't just go by

3261.92 --> 3266.69
what people say what they talk about how

3264.68 --> 3267.71
they say things how their interactions

3266.69 --> 3269.69
go

3267.71 --> 3272.39
what they share about themselves no no

3269.69 --> 3275.77
because people that think IQ tests are

3272.39 --> 3278.06
very important don't have any sensory

3275.77 --> 3279.89
social skills they don't know how to

3278.06 --> 3283.7599999999998
size up people for real they don't know

3279.89 --> 3288.83
how to really determine how sharp

3283.76 --> 3293.51
somebody is because that only works with

3288.83 --> 3299.89
intuition and you can't measure that

3293.51 --> 3305.0800000000004
with an IQ test you can't measure wisdom

3299.89 --> 3305.08
with an IQ test doesn't work

3309.44 --> 3314.03
oh why do I thank you rub Wiggles for

3312.11 --> 3338.83
the $5 super Jetta nation have a nice

3314.03 --> 3338.8300000000004
day you too what's this

3344.88 --> 3356.1600000000003
okay is there any reason you're removing

3347.849 --> 3358.579
is lorry Hooksett gun sooner I don't

3356.16 --> 3358.5789999999997
know who that is

3368.87 --> 3371.969
[Music]

3384.23 --> 3386.26
Oh

3387.64 --> 3391.5099999999998
well Gunson a forerunner MP there's a

3389.77 --> 3393.0099999999998
lot of those like every time I was a

3391.51 --> 3396.2400000000002
pops in there so he's always got a few

3393.01 --> 3396.2400000000002
cronies coming with him

3405.43 --> 3412.18
what real science is always open to new

3408.579 --> 3414.67
info and scrutiny well I think that real

3412.18 --> 3416.77
science is mostly a method and you can

3414.67 --> 3419.44
of course apply that method to new

3416.77 --> 3423.579
things if you can get your hypothesis

3419.44 --> 3426.04
right but this real science you are

3423.579 --> 3429.849
talking about is probably not that it's

3426.04 --> 3434.71
probably the pseudoscience cultural

3429.849 --> 3436.96
project what you're talking about where

3434.71 --> 3439.839
everything is okay like everything

3436.96 --> 3441.819
becomes science it's just body of human

3439.839 --> 3447.27
knowledge is just figuring out basic

3441.819 --> 3447.27
things become science now is that it

3447.839 --> 3456.93
because that is not science really you

3452.8 --> 3456.9300000000003
can think of it as science but it's not

3462.48 --> 3465.55
[Music]

3487.92 --> 3497.58
yeah yeah I say nobody cares out little

3494.88 --> 3502.13
you care and they're doing it for the

3497.58 --> 3505.5299999999997
money and then yeah nobody has to be

3502.13 --> 3507.78
sorry for thinking that you might have a

3505.53 --> 3512.4300000000003
little bit more of a soul in common

3507.78 --> 3514.6800000000003
decency you know we don't care about how

3512.43 --> 3517.3799999999997
shameless you are you don't have to grab

3514.68 --> 3519.33
her virtual signal to people you know

3517.38 --> 3521.1
that may work with the ballers you know

3519.33 --> 3525.5299999999997
that works among demons this doesn't

3521.1 --> 3530.96
work among people that are actually real

3525.53 --> 3530.96
so please keep it to yourself

3543.25 --> 3550.99
right narcissist narcissism shuts down

3546.46 --> 3551.859
new info well potentially like

3550.99 --> 3555.49
narcissists

3551.859 --> 3557.109
use info to control people that's kind

3555.49 --> 3561.58
of part of the thing that they end up

3557.109 --> 3564.0989999999997
doing a lot so at that they also try to

3561.58 --> 3567.19
keep info out it's like keeping a spell

3564.099 --> 3569.0800000000004
going keeping a safe space going you got

3567.19 --> 3570.91
to be attuned to that frequency that is

3569.08 --> 3576.0
comfortable to the crowd you're trying

3570.91 --> 3578.77
to draw in so you got to keep info from

3576.0 --> 3583.24
disturbing and potentially altering them

3578.77 --> 3585.52
so they will not just want to be there

3583.24 --> 3590.02
in your show with your format anyway

3585.52 --> 3592.78
it's very calculated very calculates

3590.02 --> 3597.06
very sociopathic - it's just it's

3592.78 --> 3601.119
basically grab their tactics just using

3597.06 --> 3606.42
oversight and social manipulation social

3601.119 --> 3609.52
engineering to reap profits from a herd

3606.42 --> 3611.9500000000003
there's a specific group of people that

3609.52 --> 3618.22
invented this concept by the way you

3611.95 --> 3631.6189999999997
might recognize them by yeah by the size

3618.22 --> 3631.6189999999997
of their hat that's is what it is

3641.1 --> 3647.46
right well rocky a life you know I tried

3644.76 --> 3649.3500000000004
to well make money I did try to get

3647.46 --> 3652.14
donations to keep going as well so I

3649.35 --> 3655.44
also partially do this for the money but

3652.14 --> 3656.54
the money faster is critical to keep it

3655.44 --> 3660.9900000000002
going

3656.54 --> 3664.2599999999998
that's really why why I ask money like

3660.99 --> 3668.6099999999997
if I had enough money for whatever I

3664.26 --> 3671.13
wouldn't care yeah well it might be nice

3668.61 --> 3673.9500000000003
to have extra donation so I'd have less

3671.13 --> 3678.42
costs from where I get my money from

3673.95 --> 3681.6499999999996
like that but I wouldn't be doing it as

3678.42 --> 3685.02
I do right now basically yeah

3681.65 --> 3687.14
just saying like I am kind of dependent

3685.02 --> 3690.92
on their donations

3687.14 --> 3690.92
that's my format

3708.92 --> 3713.81
oh yeah recchia life yeah I know oh

3711.23 --> 3719.57
that's all you know he does everything

3713.81 --> 3724.6
for money so Jose is just basically what

3719.57 --> 3727.4900000000002
do you call that when a pom bleep yeah

3724.6 --> 3732.8199999999997
you could compare it to when a bigger

3727.49 --> 3735.4399999999996
company goes public and Allah basically

3732.82 --> 3740.09
gets the stock market involved and

3735.44 --> 3742.85
investors and all that that's what what

3740.09 --> 3745.1000000000004
Jose is trying to do with his show it's

3742.85 --> 3747.83
allowing others to invest in it and get

3745.1 --> 3750.08
power see that is what stock market

3747.83 --> 3752.45
share does when you sell your company on

3750.08 --> 3754.58
the stock market you get people that are

3752.45 --> 3756.4399999999996
basically buying sort of co-ownership

3754.58 --> 3758.0299999999997
and then there's our own rules and [ __ ]

3756.44 --> 3760.67
and what they can do that's what he's

3758.03 --> 3765.76
trying to do you know what eventually

3760.67 --> 3765.76
tends to happen with companies like that

3765.85 --> 3773.15
they break up because a lot of people

3770.42 --> 3776.81
that can just buy in there with money

3773.15 --> 3778.67
they can then unleash their stupid

3776.81 --> 3781.0099999999998
little plans on it they can grabble it

3778.67 --> 3783.86
with that it's the it's the grab less

3781.01 --> 3785.8100000000004
opportunity to become a part of it sees

3783.86 --> 3790.79
a piece of power and then start

3785.81 --> 3794.24
manipulating the [ __ ] out of it right

3790.79 --> 3798.23
and change what such a company really is

3794.24 --> 3802.1899999999996
and yeah well that's happening all right

3798.23 --> 3803.87
with Jose and so as a result of it yeah

3802.19 --> 3808.61
he now has people that are basically

3803.87 --> 3811.8399999999997
have bought into shares and they exert

3808.61 --> 3814.94
some kind of privilege by basically

3811.84 --> 3817.34
disrupting the normal flow of things and

3814.94 --> 3821.0
Jose is all great it's like yeah yeah

3817.34 --> 3823.2200000000003
yeah that's a good decision because I

3821.0 --> 3827.41
got a little bit more money and it's

3823.22 --> 3831.8599999999997
worth changing everything for for now

3827.41 --> 3834.0499999999997
until at some point of course yeah who's

3831.86 --> 3840.4100000000003
gonna be left eventually to be sniped

3834.05 --> 3842.4500000000003
out with pay to kick who's gonna come

3840.41 --> 3847.43
there have a discussion just

3842.45 --> 3849.3199999999997
have some [ __ ] like Sean Hawkins tell

3847.43 --> 3852.589
you you need to be silenced all of a

3849.32 --> 3854.839
sudden you know eventually it'll stop

3852.589 --> 3857.15
you being worth it and this great

3854.839 --> 3858.94
chemistry you got going here on your

3857.15 --> 3865.76
platform between ballers and

3858.94 --> 3869.81
flat-earthers he'll die right and unlike

3865.76 --> 3871.55
what happened in the years of red flat

3869.81 --> 3874.22
earth debates where ballers first had

3871.55 --> 3876.7400000000002
kind of an over hand for the situation

3874.22 --> 3878.45
and now they absolutely don't that it's

3876.74 --> 3881.45
completely the other way around it's

3878.45 --> 3884.96
absolutely death grounds for ballers but

3881.45 --> 3886.7599999999998
they still get in there right and they

3884.96 --> 3890.66
keep coming in there well that's not

3886.76 --> 3893.57
gonna happen with your platform because

3890.66 --> 3897.29
your platform is dominated by ballers

3893.57 --> 3900.26
and it doesn't work out that way because

3897.29 --> 3904.31
flat earthers don't have a necessity to

3900.26 --> 3907.3100000000004
come over to baller hives and defend

3904.31 --> 3910.069
their concepts they don't need to do

3907.31 --> 3912.98
that they don't feel the need to do that

3910.069 --> 3916.91
ballers however are constantly

3912.98 --> 3920.39
threatened personally threatened by the

3916.91 --> 3922.19
very divided sheer existence of flat

3920.39 --> 3923.75
earthers having consistent channels and

3922.19 --> 3927.29
arguments in the housekeeping questions

3923.75 --> 3930.8
that they will insist taking whatever

3927.29 --> 3933.29
punishment necessary to have some kind

3930.8 --> 3936.23
of chance to get on and hand out a

3933.29 --> 3938.21
feeling to whoever's listening that

3936.23 --> 3941.18
there may be a chance for the ball after

3938.21 --> 3944.859
all that's not gonna happen on your

3941.18 --> 3947.21
channel the way things are going Jose oh

3944.859 --> 3952.7599999999998
you're totally disagreeing with me

3947.21 --> 3955.39
oh I'll heed my words buddy because this

3952.76 --> 3957.7700000000004
is a full-out prediction for you

3955.39 --> 3962.29
full-out prediction and literally

3957.77 --> 3965.93
handing you a piece of information that

3962.29 --> 3967.79
other people would probably ask literal

3965.93 --> 3970.52
money for before they even start talking

3967.79 --> 3974.5099999999998
about it I just gave it to you just like

3970.52 --> 3976.75
that and and you're too proud to even

3974.51 --> 3976.75
hear

3992.53 --> 3995.599
[Music]

3997.16 --> 4006.56
see that is how you've rebutted troll

4001.27 --> 4008.03
for real now trolls think that there are

4006.56 --> 4011.69
trolls you know that they can troll

4008.03 --> 4015.1400000000003
somebody but call me a troll yeah that

4011.69 --> 4019.82
they can troll somebody control can

4015.14 --> 4022.73
troll that's very close but you need to

4019.82 --> 4025.4900000000002
actually be able to find a real flaw and

4022.73 --> 4028.85
get underneath somebody's skin to be a

4025.49 --> 4030.9199999999996
troll because if you don't you're just

4028.85 --> 4034.5699999999997
pointing out something and then you get

4030.92 --> 4038.42
a full-on rebuttal and then suddenly

4034.57 --> 4040.13
you're the one getting cold it's your

4038.42 --> 4044.35
own fault because you started you

4040.13 --> 4047.81
thought you got something and instead

4044.35 --> 4049.22
you're the one that got caught you're

4047.81 --> 4051.47
the one that's getting confronted with

4049.22 --> 4054.77
something real that's not what you troll

4051.47 --> 4057.98
for you troll because you wanted to

4054.77 --> 4060.44
impose what you think is reality on to

4057.98 --> 4063.17
somebody else and then hoping that that

4060.44 --> 4064.79
magically will work out because you

4063.17 --> 4066.14
don't understand what the [ __ ] is going

4064.79 --> 4068.12
on because you're believing a lot of

4066.14 --> 4071.5699999999997
[ __ ] including that lying is okay

4068.12 --> 4074.95
and that reality is are flexible and

4071.57 --> 4080.1400000000003
your math and [ __ ] yeah yeah Oh

4074.95 --> 4080.14
doesn't work it's not gonna work

4080.42 --> 4091.16
oh now it's called interaction is it

4089.24 --> 4097.73
well you said you were a troll earlier

4091.16 --> 4100.639
so maybe you were just lying again like

4097.73 --> 4102.08
reality seems very flexible to you one

4100.639 --> 4105.71
moment you can make this profound

4102.08 --> 4107.719
statement that says a lot it's a lot of

4105.71 --> 4110.0
pride inserted in there and then you get

4107.719 --> 4113.42
something in return it's like oh no I'm

4110.0 --> 4117.139
just going to rotate oh and all I've

4113.42 --> 4120.9400000000005
never said that it's almost like what

4117.139 --> 4124.25
rumpus does but in a social setting

4120.94 --> 4127.73
so rumpus intellectually creates

4124.25 --> 4132.049
machinations a lot twists logical

4127.73 --> 4137.739
reality to suit his concepts you seem to

4132.049 --> 4137.739
be doing that with social interactions

4144.29 --> 4150.98
no you don't keep it real you're a

4146.63 --> 4153.29
filthy liar slanderer social manipulator

4150.98 --> 4156.259999999999
and effectively you have all the

4153.29 --> 4159.7699999999995
symptoms you've shown by now all the

4156.26 --> 4164.360000000001
symptoms that all come together as a

4159.77 --> 4167.120000000001
sociopath not saying you are but you

4164.36 --> 4170.57
certainly seem to be very okay just

4167.12 --> 4172.58
spreading that out there maybe it's just

4170.57 --> 4174.83
a moment in your life or maybe this is

4172.58 --> 4176.09
just really you showing yourself because

4174.83 --> 4177.97
you're sick of it you think I you've

4176.09 --> 4183.34
read you can do it I can do it too I

4177.97 --> 4188.6900000000005
want freedom I want freedom from decency

4183.34 --> 4191.99
mmm-hmm Jose you like that yeah you keep

4188.69 --> 4194.03
it real every single day yeah I don't

4191.99 --> 4198.099999999999
think that you even leave that at this

4194.03 --> 4198.099999999999
point but keep chanting buddy

4215.18 --> 4221.0
yeah well nobody gives a [ __ ] Jose

4221.63 --> 4226.05
because you can't even name the times

4224.43 --> 4228.030000000001
that I'm wrong because you've already

4226.05 --> 4233.51
admitted you don't have the intellectual

4228.03 --> 4234.78
capacity to figure out what's real so

4233.51 --> 4236.76
yeah

4234.78 --> 4240.8099999999995
you may think you're respecting my

4236.76 --> 4243.18
opinion when I appear to you to be wrong

4240.81 --> 4246.51
but you couldn't really say what that

4243.18 --> 4248.820000000001
was and then back that up as an ER with

4246.51 --> 4251.6990000000005
an argument because you like to assert

4248.82 --> 4254.61
something as reality and not follow up

4251.699 --> 4257.5199999999995
on anything concerning it like a

4254.61 --> 4262.0199999999995
delusional fantasies and sociopath that

4257.52 --> 4264.51
just likes to create nonsense and then

4262.02 --> 4266.9400000000005
pretend it's real and then you think

4264.51 --> 4268.8
that by pretending that you believe in

4266.94 --> 4270.179999999999
it that others will it will rub off on

4268.8 --> 4271.14
them too because they're all weak

4270.18 --> 4272.85
they're soft

4271.14 --> 4274.56
that's what you think because you're

4272.85 --> 4276.18
you're acting like a grappler you think

4274.56 --> 4280.080000000001
that everybody's stupid enough to buy

4276.18 --> 4283.68
your a lie just because you can sort of

4280.08 --> 4289.58
make yourself believe that [ __ ] it

4283.68 --> 4289.58
doesn't work it really doesn't

4312.79 --> 4316.76
[Music]

4321.86 --> 4329.009999999999
no it's just Jose's doublespeak attempt

4324.989 --> 4330.33
to have some kind of graceful exit it's

4329.01 --> 4333.0
when he did it on the flat earth debates

4330.33 --> 4337.01
- like when he's absolutely getting

4333.0 --> 4343.469
gutted and pummeled and squished so bad

4337.01 --> 4346.530000000001
so so bad and he's just like oh no I'm

4343.469 --> 4349.679
just going to do a little dancey act

4346.53 --> 4351.719
have a little voice voice and pretend

4349.679 --> 4353.55
like everything is okay and oh it's out

4351.719 --> 4356.58
of my control but I'm okay because I'm

4353.55 --> 4358.89
not touched by anything about reality or

4356.58 --> 4364.199
social consequences of my actions and

4358.89 --> 4366.83
just go to oka we know oh that's what

4364.199 --> 4366.83
you do Jose

4401.48 --> 4411.589999999999
yeah the BG squid

4407.03 --> 4414.29
really why does NASA and the world need

4411.59 --> 4416.39
to lie about chill the shale the shape

4414.29 --> 4418.48
of the earth right how does it benefit

4416.39 --> 4425.77
them well how about the biggest budget

4418.48 --> 4425.7699999999995
known how about how much wasn't again

4426.01 --> 4434.4800000000005
it's like the most insane budget ever so

4430.58 --> 4438.86
would money be a good reason to lie for

4434.48 --> 4441.5599999999995
a very very long time about a big big

4438.86 --> 4443.089999999999
thing they could get a huge budget out

4441.56 --> 4446.96
of it you think that could be a good

4443.09 --> 4449.39
enough reason there's a whole category

4446.96 --> 4451.82
of people that kind of like to do that

4449.39 --> 4457.1
constantly they're in politics

4451.82 --> 4459.62
especially you know know they'll lie

4457.1 --> 4462.8
they'll lie for years for decades if

4459.62 --> 4466.04
they could get away with it and get a

4462.8 --> 4468.26
lot of money somewhere in someplace

4466.04 --> 4470.21
where they want that money to be some

4468.26 --> 4480.26
corporation that they have control of or

4470.21 --> 4482.63
whatever so yeah that's why they lie 50

4480.26 --> 4485.8
million a day cheese okay yeah that's

4482.63 --> 4485.8
even more than I thought

4492.3 --> 4495.359
[Music]

4506.14 --> 4512.400000000001
oh god they're getting even more at the

4508.54 --> 4515.94
space force nonsense it's horrific

4512.4 --> 4515.94
why did they do that

4538.469 --> 4544.33
all right yeah you know what when I

4542.02 --> 4550.540000000001
consider that I should probably ask a

4544.33 --> 4554.83
little bit more than 6 million to help

4550.54 --> 4559.21
out the baller conceptualization

4554.83 --> 4561.76
universe you know 6 million they could

4559.21 --> 4562.86
definitely pay more than that Oh Who am

4561.76 --> 4565.6900000000005
I kidding

4562.86 --> 4569.44
they don't give a [ __ ] they probably

4565.69 --> 4572.589999999999
already just tapped that just leached my

4569.44 --> 4575.199
mind made me spill the guts about it all

4572.59 --> 4576.909000000001
in a dream somewhere like 20 years ago

4575.199 --> 4579.4
they probably already have all

4576.909 --> 4583.509999999999
everything I ever thought of just work

4579.4 --> 4586.75
in their machinations and they're just

4583.51 --> 4590.9490000000005
waiting a long time for me to do

4586.75 --> 4592.36
whatever I do I don't know sometimes I

4590.949 --> 4596.4
have to feeling it this the really

4592.36 --> 4598.989
nothing could ever do to get anything

4596.4 --> 4601.8099999999995
it's just a slow building process this

4598.989 --> 4603.61
is this so far like what I'm doing here

4601.81 --> 4605.71
and getting donations and everything for

4603.61 --> 4610.98
people it's been the most successful

4605.71 --> 4610.9800000000005
exploit of my life financially really

4626.489 --> 4630.32
my first email I had a just

4632.66 --> 4639.23
I wonder just with that money like is it

4636.83 --> 4641.5599999999995
actually all even spent or is it just

4639.23 --> 4646.129999999999
like this maneuvering room for emergency

4641.56 --> 4649.7300000000005
situations emergency machination is it

4646.13 --> 4652.01
that like what the [ __ ] are they

4649.73 --> 4654.589999999999
spending all that money on literally

4652.01 --> 4656.9800000000005
like every single thing that's just

4654.59 --> 4656.9800000000005
impossible

4657.55 --> 4667.58
you can't vacation all that money away

4660.89 --> 4670.1
you know at some point it's just that

4667.58 --> 4673.88
just yeah at some point like NASA is

4670.1 --> 4677.56
just gonna be like a bank like a private

4673.88 --> 4681.2
bank like that wouldn't you say is it a

4677.56 --> 4685.63
do does NASA have like a banking

4681.2 --> 4688.73
function that would make a lot of sense

4685.63 --> 4691.0
they could do that with that huge amount

4688.73 --> 4691.0
of money

4697.86 --> 4708.869
and lots of funds Hollywood hmm you have

4705.389 --> 4713.01
a point there right a lot of extra

4708.869 --> 4716.0
budget could go to NASA people putting

4713.01 --> 4719.1
them ensuring it's like machination

4716.0 --> 4722.81
insurance that it's like yeah they have

4719.1 --> 4725.909000000001
to check and tinker with the illusions

4722.81 --> 4729.0
to keep it consistent according to the

4725.909 --> 4730.949
the official narrative of how space is

4729.0 --> 4733.32
supposed to work in all that they're

4730.949 --> 4736.83
there to keep the story straight in the

4733.32 --> 4739.92
in the Hollywood that might cost a

4736.83 --> 4743.3099999999995
little extra but seriously it's it's

4739.92 --> 4746.96
still an insane amount of money that's

4743.31 --> 4746.96
not all going to that no way

4764.58 --> 4769.42
who

4766.7 --> 4769.42
all right

4799.56 --> 4807.030000000001
you got a good point there misery bear

4802.02 --> 4809.93
but that's the whole thing isn't it like

4807.03 --> 4812.61
what if NASA I would be defunded right

4809.93 --> 4815.33
then what's gonna happen with all the

4812.61 --> 4817.98
Hollywood movies like is this

4815.33 --> 4819.6
space-themed things just gonna go away

4817.98 --> 4824.639999999999
they know like could they no longer

4819.6 --> 4828.06
maintain that or yeah and I'm pretty

4824.64 --> 4830.450000000001
sure also NASA has a lot of like I don't

4828.06 --> 4834.0
know it's almost like a corporate social

4830.45 --> 4837.3
jobs program as well so what's gonna

4834.0 --> 4839.22
happen with all that like technically

4837.3 --> 4842.58
you got to realize that if NASA just

4839.22 --> 4844.62
went away just like that it's well for

4842.58 --> 4847.05
whatever that's worth right now at this

4844.62 --> 4849.3
moment it will just make the economy

4847.05 --> 4851.820000000001
kind of go down because that's what

4849.3 --> 4855.900000000001
economy is it's just money rolling

4851.82 --> 4858.7699999999995
people doing [ __ ] right even if it is

4855.9 --> 4858.7699999999995
just state-sponsored

4863.6 --> 4873.2300000000005
so I don't know I don't know yeah really

4870.37 --> 4877.99
how that could be maneuvered in a way

4873.23 --> 4877.99
that it that it will be less damaging

4886.199 --> 4889.009999999999
all right

4889.46 --> 4898.94
I just I didn't know man I have ideas

4895.7 --> 4901.13
about it it basically stems from the my

4898.94 --> 4903.2
whole view of like a potential future

4901.13 --> 4905.99
with the dual cosmic cosmic chemical

4903.2 --> 4909.22
society where Flat Earth would be

4905.99 --> 4912.05
accepted but the ball would still be

4909.22 --> 4913.46
yeah like a storytelling tradition

4912.05 --> 4915.860000000001
basically it's it's the science fiction

4913.46 --> 4917.99
world but it would be cleared up that it

4915.86 --> 4923.99
is sign that it's not real it's just

4917.99 --> 4927.86
there to enjoy like that if there's any

4923.99 --> 4930.08
of that left that's even possible the

4927.86 --> 4932.0199999999995
way that yeah things are going on you

4930.08 --> 4935.87
know there's too much darkness going on

4932.02 --> 4942.02
really to appreciate that anymore at

4935.87 --> 4945.74
this point I think even filtrate the

4942.02 --> 4947.660000000001
Flat Earth to say what Missouri Bear you

4945.74 --> 4951.26
don't even know what the flatter society

4947.66 --> 4954.32
is really they're probably I don't know

4951.26 --> 4957.89
some secret service connection [ __ ]

4954.32 --> 4961.099999999999
there I don't think it like why why

4957.89 --> 4964.76
would you even want to do that they

4961.1 --> 4967.780000000001
barely do anything anyway they're just

4964.76 --> 4970.46
there as an icon to point at for media

4967.78 --> 4974.44
that's that they're just a marker to

4970.46 --> 4974.44
point that they don't really do anything

4977.41 --> 4983.599999999999
like we the public flatter thing on

4981.2 --> 4987.82
YouTube and all over the Internet

4983.6 --> 4991.370000000001
we've outgrown them like a million times

4987.82 --> 4993.53
- all combined why would you want to

4991.37 --> 4996.0199999999995
infiltrate the Flat Earth Society it's a

4993.53 --> 4998.05
it's a relic it's a relic from the 20th

4996.02 --> 4998.05
century

5018.22 --> 5038.31
Oh getting a bit hungry but

5035.77 --> 5044.77
organisations bring the power of thought

5038.31 --> 5047.26
okay well why would you need to

5044.77 --> 5051.22
infiltrate anything out there to do that

5047.26 --> 5062.5
you could try to build something like

5051.22 --> 5064.12
that on your own you know if I like this

5062.5 --> 5066.85
idea has been going around for a long

5064.12 --> 5069.4
time already it's just that the problem

5066.85 --> 5071.26
is is that everybody's there's not

5069.4 --> 5074.349999999999
enough cohesion to really make it

5071.26 --> 5076.570000000001
functional too much unless you got like

5074.35 --> 5081.610000000001
this monolithic guy that isn't corrupted

5076.57 --> 5086.92
I'll try to find that right that that

5081.61 --> 5089.08
just owns it and just like utilizes it

5086.92 --> 5091.84
to the best of their ability but you

5089.08 --> 5096.7
could just have a foundation for a flat

5091.84 --> 5099.01
earth like a flat earth foundation but

5096.7 --> 5103.12
yeah what would that do you know it's

5099.01 --> 5106.0
like if you really want something to do

5103.12 --> 5107.98
something with flat earth in the world

5106.0 --> 5111.43
change it's something you got to have a

5107.98 --> 5115.959999999999
plan you got to really really carefully

5111.43 --> 5117.85
think about it you got to know what it

5115.96 --> 5121.06
is you really want to accomplish and

5117.85 --> 5123.13
then see if that even has some potential

5121.06 --> 5127.5
viability in the scheme of everything

5123.13 --> 5127.5
that's going on right now you know

5132.05 --> 5140.519
like you don't really need a foundation

5135.769 --> 5145.1990000000005
like a money foundation unless you have

5140.519 --> 5145.829000000001
something specific you think needs to be

5145.199 --> 5148.768999999999
done

5145.829 --> 5150.48
that requires a foundation to do it

5148.769 --> 5152.219
that's the order of how you should be

5150.48 --> 5154.348999999999
thinking not the other way right it's

5152.219 --> 5156.2390000000005
not like make a money pot and then just

5154.349 --> 5162.349
think of whatever no that never that

5156.239 --> 5165.69
rarely works now you need something that

5162.349 --> 5169.139
you are you're gonna bet on you're gonna

5165.69 --> 5172.138999999999
you're gonna do that

5169.139 --> 5176.749
that requires a foundation and then it's

5172.139 --> 5176.749
a good idea to start making a foundation

5212.88 --> 5222.45
oh my god Missouri bear that's that's a

5217.23 --> 5225.03
really nice idea but you're almost

5222.45 --> 5228.179999999999
talking about like an alternative

5225.03 --> 5231.12
society an alternative entirety of

5228.18 --> 5234.72
internet this is impossible it's just no

5231.12 --> 5239.55
freakin way it you know the best you can

5234.72 --> 5244.29
do is have one safe haven for one

5239.55 --> 5249.4800000000005
purpose and then yeah keep that going

5244.29 --> 5253.29
you can't just have an entire

5249.48 --> 5257.04
alternative information internet thing

5253.29 --> 5263.76
that's it's too big it's it's never

5257.04 --> 5265.92
gonna work out you know it's all the

5263.76 --> 5268.62
internet is just all people and a lot of

5265.92 --> 5271.62
them disagree with each other a lot and

5268.62 --> 5273.599999999999
why it's really functional is because

5271.62 --> 5275.82
people can make up their own minds and

5273.6 --> 5278.700000000001
go back and forth compare it and then

5275.82 --> 5281.45
figure out that the separate individuals

5278.7 --> 5286.65
could not figure out for themselves

5281.45 --> 5288.8099999999995
that's what creates this awakening

5286.65 --> 5290.58
grouse birth effect it is because there

5288.81 --> 5293.64
are so many individuals out there on the

5290.58 --> 5298.67
internet doing their own thing they

5293.64 --> 5305.04
can't unify that doesn't work like that

5298.67 --> 5309.06
just doesn't know what you need is in

5305.04 --> 5311.31
free internet with a safe platforming

5309.06 --> 5314.13
situation where everybody can just do

5311.31 --> 5315.93
their thing develop themselves and then

5314.13 --> 5319.2
have it all freely available without

5315.93 --> 5323.25
censorship that is what makes things

5319.2 --> 5325.83
work but yeah in order to accomplish

5323.25 --> 5328.31
that you just need to be a you mean need

5325.83 --> 5332.43
to be a social media mega platform a

5328.31 --> 5335.450000000001
mega platform oh those are gonna have

5332.43 --> 5339.06
some insanely stiff competition and

5335.45 --> 5341.389999999999
dangers of potential hostile takeover in

5339.06 --> 5343.740000000001
the future if you don't watch out

5341.39 --> 5345.09
because there's grabbers in control

5343.74 --> 5346.05
there they have all the major

5345.09 --> 5348.57
corporations

5346.05 --> 5351.329000000001
think that those mega-corporations are

5348.57 --> 5354.509999999999
gonna indulge competition that's

5351.329 --> 5357.329
specifically there to offer a purified

5354.51 --> 5365.13
version of what they maintain there's no

5357.329 --> 5366.84
way there's no way no I don't see it

5365.13 --> 5370.079
happening the best you can do is make

5366.84 --> 5372.51
one little corner but it's almost like

5370.079 --> 5374.19
what Owen Benjamin has been doing with

5372.51 --> 5376.77
unauthorized that TV it's like its own

5374.19 --> 5381.388999999999
video platform thing but it's small and

5376.77 --> 5383.34
that's what makes it survivable and even

5381.389 --> 5387.869
in a way for example Alex Jones has

5383.34 --> 5389.599
banned that video and yeah for whatever

5387.869 --> 5393.179
that's worth to you you know but it is

5389.599 --> 5394.860000000001
secured for the purposes that he wants

5393.179 --> 5398.67
to be secured he wants to be her

5394.86 --> 5402.659
national trainer yeah that's what that's

5398.67 --> 5405.599
about see but if that was the only thing

5402.659 --> 5409.348999999999
what the [ __ ] you know that's net that

5405.599 --> 5412.77
that's not worth anything but because

5409.349 --> 5415.650000000001
it's there you know it's there and then

5412.77 --> 5417.42
other things are there they're free self

5415.65 --> 5418.799999999999
secured and you know they're there and

5417.42 --> 5420.57
then you have all these things to

5418.8 --> 5427.9800000000005
compare with and that's what's gonna

5420.57 --> 5431.219
work a unified central platform and then

5427.98 --> 5433.25
keeping that and Grabel good luck with

5431.219 --> 5433.25
that

5438.4 --> 5441.549999999999
[Music]

5447.29 --> 5453.43
[Music]

5465.659 --> 5470.549999999999
what do grapplers do when they want to

5467.939 --> 5473.719
change culture well they change culture

5470.55 --> 5478.860000000001
they introduce their version they

5473.719 --> 5481.409
liberate it from I don't know so subtle

5478.86 --> 5483.839999999999
wise from morality they owe what they do

5481.409 --> 5486.499
to change society is they take it slow

5483.84 --> 5490.829
they corrupt slowly step by step

5486.499 --> 5494.719
increment by increment and they take a

5490.829 --> 5497.518999999999
long time to do it as long as requires

5494.719 --> 5500.429
according to their insights according to

5497.519 --> 5506.900000000001
their statistical calculations that's

5500.429 --> 5510.959
how it goes these days incremental slow

5506.9 --> 5514.709
change towards corruption always in some

5510.959 --> 5517.079
way always doubting that little little

5514.709 --> 5519.179
bit of morality here and little bit

5517.079 --> 5521.639
there and then just let it slide let it

5519.179 --> 5523.289
become normal and then you take the next

5521.639 --> 5526.709
step you'd bring it to the next level

5523.289 --> 5529.759999999999
and originally if you don't know what's

5526.709 --> 5535.8
going on with that you think that's

5529.76 --> 5537.900000000001
liberal that that is a liberation that's

5535.8 --> 5539.849
the perspective that they offer look we

5537.9 --> 5544.438999999999
are liberal we liberate you from

5539.849 --> 5547.26
morality because from an atheist

5544.439 --> 5549.959000000001
perspective morality is an artificial

5547.26 --> 5552.2390000000005
construct it's fake it's not real it and

5549.959 --> 5554.489
God this is neither you know and all

5552.239 --> 5558.178999999999
that so that's what that is that's what

5554.489 --> 5561.959
they do they liberate you making it

5558.179 --> 5565.889
liberal by liberating you from morality

5561.959 --> 5567.9
very slowly one step at a time as at a

5565.889 --> 5572.689
pace that they think that they can

5567.9 --> 5572.688999999999
afford and that's what grabbers do

5586.18 --> 5592.610000000001
no they don't

5588.22 --> 5596.030000000001
Missouri bear well you could have a bear

5592.61 --> 5598.37
foundation like a look there's like

5596.03 --> 5600.5
Christian foundations that kind of used

5598.37 --> 5601.88
to do that to I don't know how secure

5600.5 --> 5603.38
they are or if they're completely

5601.88 --> 5607.64
gravelled as well and a political

5603.38 --> 5611.96
nonsense and all that could be pretty

5607.64 --> 5614.360000000001
sure in the Netherlands they are but the

5611.96 --> 5616.4
foundation could work but again yeah

5614.36 --> 5620.15
you're gonna have to have some big-money

5616.4 --> 5623.08
players because why foundations work why

5620.15 --> 5625.49
grabbling and Grabel foundations work

5623.08 --> 5627.8
you know this is the trick this is the

5625.49 --> 5631.45
devil's trick is because there is

5627.8 --> 5635.96
effectively money coming from people

5631.45 --> 5641.0
surrendering surrendering to bad morals

5635.96 --> 5644.42
it makes the grab ler money that's why

5641.0 --> 5648.35
that works so if you can somehow reverse

5644.42 --> 5651.2300000000005
that and like get a logos profit system

5648.35 --> 5654.67
going in some way you got to think that

5651.23 --> 5664.87
through carefully and then maybe yeah a

5654.67 --> 5664.87
foundation could work for that yeah

5667.57 --> 5678.04
called the collie Foundation and grabble

5671.79 --> 5680.8
the ungrer Foundation about that I would

5678.04 --> 5695.37
never take that upon me that would be

5680.8 --> 5699.12
Big Bear thing but again it it only

5695.37 --> 5702.36
Foundation only works if you have

5699.12 --> 5705.97
something that needs to be done

5702.36 --> 5709.42
specifically specific actions specific

5705.97 --> 5711.820000000001
actions that require money if you have a

5709.42 --> 5713.89
plan for that that is the real that

5711.82 --> 5715.75
should be the focus that is the real

5713.89 --> 5719.4400000000005
foundation the foundation is just a

5715.75 --> 5722.97
freakin money pot if it doesn't have a

5719.44 --> 5726.73
purpose then it just becomes a dragon's

5722.97 --> 5730.21
heart after a while and it'll get gravel

5726.73 --> 5733.66
this happens with all purposeless money

5730.21 --> 5735.58
pots always happens always always always

5733.66 --> 5736.7699999999995
always always always always always

5735.58 --> 5740.65
always always

5736.77 --> 5745.77
so that's foundations only work if they

5740.65 --> 5750.57
have a foundation if they have a reason

5745.77 --> 5754.77
that there needs to be money there then

5750.57 --> 5754.7699999999995
it starts working

5763.08 --> 5766.2699999999995
[Music]

5771.47 --> 5778.75
[Music]

5789.01 --> 5794.38
yeah that's that's really nice Barth's

5791.23 --> 5797.679999999999
chemo chemo I have asked for money and

5794.38 --> 5803.26
and yeah truth may be free but living is

5797.68 --> 5808.51
not free and trying to achieve a certain

5803.26 --> 5812.68
level in what you do that yeah that

5808.51 --> 5816.34
requires time and that time and yeah an

5812.68 --> 5820.18
energy that requires yeah money to

5816.34 --> 5823.81
maintain that so yeah truth may be free

5820.18 --> 5825.97
but living is not and I'm effectively

5823.81 --> 5828.580000000001
doing this for a living

5825.97 --> 5836.59
besides taking social welfare which it

5828.58 --> 5839.85
don't really like doing you know I hope

5836.59 --> 5839.85
to get out of that someday

5845.63 --> 5851.43
sorry I don't know where you get your

5847.74 --> 5853.5
budget maybe you've got a extensive job

5851.43 --> 5855.96
maybe you got your life all set and

5853.5 --> 5857.79
hoary donkey that's really nice that

5855.96 --> 5859.92
you're doing that all for free you know

5857.79 --> 5863.63
truth for free that's that's lovely I

5859.92 --> 5863.63
can't afford to do that

5864.14 --> 5867.71
it's as simple as that

5873.73 --> 5876.78
[Music]

5882.689 --> 5889.519
really nothing changed nothing

5893.91 --> 5900.84
I beg to differ I think a lot has

5896.31 --> 5908.13
changed I'm doing a lot better now

5900.84 --> 5912.83
I am healing a lot compared to say two

5908.13 --> 5916.32
years ago that's some very severe

5912.83 --> 5920.49
difficult situation that I did yeah and

5916.32 --> 5922.53
now I also share very deeply you know so

5920.49 --> 5927.15
very deeply and I can't afford that I

5922.53 --> 5929.61
can actually maintain that without being

5927.15 --> 5932.36
like seriously worried afterward like oh

5929.61 --> 5936.2
[ __ ] what did I do

5932.36 --> 5939.57
because I much sharper more confident

5936.2 --> 5942.24
they still have mood swings but despite

5939.57 --> 5944.46
all that it's just much better and

5942.24 --> 5947.46
that's what's changed and it's also

5944.46 --> 5950.22
changed because I know much more what

5947.46 --> 5953.19
I'm doing and where I want to go and the

5950.22 --> 5955.2
people here in Chad I get them and they

5953.19 --> 5960.389999999999
get me and they're supporting me I

5955.2 --> 5963.57
didn't have that before and yeah I can

5960.39 --> 5966.6
give tips and it can follow up on those

5963.57 --> 5967.92
tips they give examples also thanks

5966.6 --> 5971.450000000001
because I have a little bit more

5967.92 --> 5973.95
maneuverability I can even afford

5971.45 --> 5975.96
certain types of supplements that are

5973.95 --> 5980.94
not super expensive but they still cost

5975.96 --> 5989.0
money that are helping me a lot things

5980.94 --> 5989.0
like fish oil and vitamin d3 with k2

5989.48 --> 5998.5199999999995
especially in this period you know and

5994.53 --> 6001.46
yeah I could survive potentially all

5998.52 --> 6007.070000000001
without that but I would be a lot

6001.46 --> 6009.74
shittier mood and yeah I would have a

6007.07 --> 6013.3099999999995
lot of problems probably I'd build a

6009.74 --> 6014.8099999999995
physical problems over time and that

6013.31 --> 6020.42
would make me less pleasant less

6014.81 --> 6024.679
confident of myself as well let's focus

6020.42 --> 6031.11
I dropped the ball a lot more

6024.679 --> 6033.9800000000005
so yeah that's a lie and you can get the

6031.11 --> 6033.98
[ __ ] out of here now

6044.26 --> 6056.619000000001
I don't know why you feel the need to to

6054.039 --> 6061.719
get like a filthy bighead to me as well

6056.619 --> 6068.44
or if it's just some troll pretending to

6061.719 --> 6070.889
be square scheme oh now because I got

6068.44 --> 6076.449
some of those potentially as well I

6070.889 --> 6079.659000000001
think that there is certain very very

6076.449 --> 6082.75
filthy disgusting people out there that

6079.659 --> 6084.848999999999
are trying to take figures there are

6082.75 --> 6086.53
just relatively decent people

6084.849 --> 6089.28
okay people that are kind of making

6086.53 --> 6091.96
headway and they're trying to make me

6089.28 --> 6094.03
hate on them and they're doing they're

6091.96 --> 6096.28
really doing a relatively good job

6094.03 --> 6098.59
because they're they're halfway decently

6096.28 --> 6100.75
emulating these people halfway decent

6098.59 --> 6104.139
and they're trying to make me hate

6100.75 --> 6107.079
everyone trying to make me say hateful

6104.139 --> 6110.26
things towards everyone so they then can

6107.079 --> 6113.259999999999
clip that and then shove it to under the

6110.26 --> 6116.7390000000005
noses of those people to say see he's a

6113.26 --> 6118.0
disgusting [ __ ] and he's just hating

6116.739 --> 6120.669999999999
on you for no good reason

6118.0 --> 6122.44
leaving out that they actually pretended

6120.67 --> 6127.96
to be them because that's what some

6122.44 --> 6129.489
people do so yeah and I'm pretty sure

6127.96 --> 6132.099
that it's not really spur scheme or

6129.489 --> 6134.759999999999
either because press chemo he would say

6132.099 --> 6141.13
something like yeah the truth is free

6134.76 --> 6143.38
but he would also respond to reason like

6141.13 --> 6147.21
how I responded to it and that's not

6143.38 --> 6151.84
what he did so that's definitely a troll

6147.21 --> 6155.349
and a very disgusting one in the video

6151.84 --> 6159.309
that in my personal opinion deserves to

6155.349 --> 6162.09
die people that do that they deserve to

6159.309 --> 6164.769
be beaten to death on the street or

6162.09 --> 6168.1900000000005
commit suicide in some way because if

6164.769 --> 6170.639
you do that if you go that far for any

6168.19 --> 6170.638999999999
reason

6170.889 --> 6177.52
if you try to pretend like you're

6174.489 --> 6181.599999999999
somebody else to make somebody hate that

6177.52 --> 6186.820000000001
person in an act that's death worthy in

6181.6 --> 6190.96
my opinion but yeah that's not in

6186.82 --> 6193.09
accordance to lawful Society you know

6190.96 --> 6196.51
I'm a bit extreme when it comes to that

6193.09 --> 6199.81
but I would definitely violently beat

6196.51 --> 6202.29
somebody if I had the chance and I

6199.81 --> 6205.0
caught them on something like that

6202.29 --> 6209.219
because those people just need to be

6205.0 --> 6209.219
crushed to paste

6217.86 --> 6223.839999999999
[Music]

6220.139 --> 6225.67
yeah so you can sit on that you can sit

6223.84 --> 6228.46
on that cuz I'm not gonna forget that

6225.67 --> 6232.29
[ __ ] I remember that people like that

6228.46 --> 6235.0
are out there and I catch their essence

6232.29 --> 6236.35
there so there's a chance that some of

6235.0 --> 6239.35
these people that have been doing that

6236.35 --> 6242.530000000001
that I will at some point meet them they

6239.35 --> 6248.7390000000005
may even like challenge me to [ __ ]

6242.53 --> 6251.4
kill them forgetting that well I might

6248.739 --> 6251.4
actually do it

6258.369 --> 6266.83
yeah because I don't know call it call

6263.02 --> 6270.46
it bad judgment when people are so

6266.83 --> 6274.69
demonically filthy I think that they

6270.46 --> 6278.92
literally deserve to die yeah I can't I

6274.69 --> 6282.489
can't justify that to law but I think

6278.92 --> 6287.92
they do and I think that even they're

6282.489 --> 6289.629999999999
driven from the inside to wanna die it's

6287.92 --> 6291.82
like they hate everything so much

6289.63 --> 6295.3
including themselves that they literally

6291.82 --> 6296.159
want others to kill them and that's why

6295.3 --> 6298.659000000001
they push it

6296.159 --> 6303.96
eternally far they'll push it as far as

6298.659 --> 6310.0
they humanly humanly truly can

6303.96 --> 6313.09
I've met people like that that they're

6310.0 --> 6316.179
like try they will try to set you up to

6313.09 --> 6319.0
attack them so they can then whatever

6316.179 --> 6323.139
sue you or [ __ ] like that and they'll

6319.0 --> 6329.619
take risks for that [ __ ] some people are

6323.139 --> 6333.099
that bad that bad and they're as literal

6329.619 --> 6335.739
demons as they cut and IIE the legal

6333.099 --> 6338.409000000001
implications are insane there is no way

6335.739 --> 6341.32
ever anything like that from anything I

6338.409 --> 6345.42
just said could be made lawful but at

6341.32 --> 6345.42
some point I just don't care anymore

6347.79 --> 6357.25
just don't because there's no good

6352.36 --> 6360.639
reason in any sort of way that that kind

6357.25 --> 6364.75
of disgusting behavior can just be

6360.639 --> 6369.13
allowed to happen and it in most places

6364.75 --> 6372.13
it doesn't in most places in other

6369.13 --> 6375.52
societies and maybe not so Western

6372.13 --> 6379.75
societies when people act like that they

6375.52 --> 6381.67
get killed like freaking soldiers or

6379.75 --> 6384.67
whatever police they'll just [ __ ]

6381.67 --> 6387.31
kill them like really it's like what

6384.67 --> 6390.4890000000005
lalala no no no no

6387.31 --> 6393.88
they'll just be killed just like that

6390.489 --> 6397.15
potentially out of law or they'll rub

6393.88 --> 6402.64
something else on them because that

6397.15 --> 6405.46
person just needs to die and yeah you'll

6402.64 --> 6407.59
get grabbed ler story news [ __ ] all

6405.46 --> 6409.75
day long give you all these stories all

6407.59 --> 6411.82
the reasons you don't even know why some

6409.75 --> 6416.26
of these people got executed you don't

6411.82 --> 6420.73
[ __ ] know anything behind why that

6416.26 --> 6423.1900000000005
happened you don't know anything behind

6420.73 --> 6426.04
that you don't know why that [ __ ]

6423.19 --> 6426.489
person was executed you don't know what

6426.04 --> 6430.96
they did

6426.489 --> 6437.099999999999
you don't did you ever get a backstory

6430.96 --> 6438.42
on that ever on the individual ever ever

6437.1 --> 6446.610000000001
[Music]

6438.42 --> 6451.2390000000005
hello no no you haven't and not ever

6446.61 --> 6454.29
that's because when people basically get

6451.239 --> 6458.62
publicly executed insecure the horrific

6454.29 --> 6461.62
Society yeah you think that's for no

6458.62 --> 6466.0
good reason you don't know and you

6461.62 --> 6471.82
probably will never know you they never

6466.0 --> 6474.07
tell you you never get told just get bla

6471.82 --> 6476.62
bla bla generalization see they always

6474.07 --> 6478.96
do that they always do that but no no no

6476.62 --> 6487.12
no you don't know why that [ __ ]

6478.96 --> 6489.19
happen Yeah right I don't know why I

6487.12 --> 6491.95
rolled into this dark subject all of a

6489.19 --> 6495.299999999999
sudden it's just that at some point you

6491.95 --> 6501.51
know there's just these people out there

6495.3 --> 6505.6
and mostly ignore them

6501.51 --> 6507.820000000001
but I always have just this memory like

6505.6 --> 6514.09
yeah that there are people out there

6507.82 --> 6516.63
that do this and it should not be should

6514.09 --> 6516.63
not be

6521.01 --> 6530.87
but it is so and sometimes I just I

6527.12 --> 6534.39
guess in a way that they got to me then

6530.87 --> 6536.22
because I just like to reciprocate this

6534.39 --> 6539.22
going way too far

6536.22 --> 6542.1900000000005
morally still what fuels their actions

6539.22 --> 6544.14
I'd like to respond to that by going way

6542.19 --> 6548.7
too far in the exact opposite direction

6544.14 --> 6551.46
basically saying no no in my world

6548.7 --> 6556.73
everything would be extremely turned

6551.46 --> 6556.7300000000005
around and like it could theoretically

6556.88 --> 6561.2390000000005
theoretically isn't as a fantasy setting

6559.41 --> 6565.04
because that real I would never want the

6561.239 --> 6568.32
world to be really like that ever right

6565.04 --> 6579.42
but I could definitely get a society

6568.32 --> 6583.83
where lying was punishable by death but

6579.42 --> 6588.75
yeah that's kind of far away from how

6583.83 --> 6592.01
things work now isn't it this is

6588.75 --> 6592.01
definitely not this world

6592.5 --> 6595.63
[Music]

6598.11 --> 6609.759999999999
can you imagine everything would be

6603.43 --> 6611.280000000001
different everything lying would only

6609.76 --> 6616.780000000001
ever be

6611.28 --> 6619.66
it would probably yeah did ya could

6616.78 --> 6622.09
write books about that [ __ ] fantasy

6619.66 --> 6624.07
books maybe I will at some point just to

6622.09 --> 6630.88
kind of get the freaking frustration

6624.07 --> 6634.509999999999
just I don't know I don't know why I got

6630.88 --> 6637.75
to this stupid subject anyway oh yeah it

6634.51 --> 6640.41
was some stupid troll piece of [ __ ]

6637.75 --> 6643.35
trying to pretend to be somebody else to

6640.41 --> 6652.57
get me to hate them mm-hmm

6643.35 --> 6655.83
right okay dang you're gonna get a

6652.57 --> 6663.61
Groucho mask and impersonate a grav leur

6655.83 --> 6666.42
what is a Groucho mask is that like a

6663.61 --> 6666.42
grabbling mask

6683.28 --> 6695.469999999999
mmm-hmm yeah so there's your item that

6687.79 --> 6697.45
I'm not gonna wear mask whatever I don't

6695.47 --> 6699.88
know I don't think it's gonna get any

6697.45 --> 6704.349999999999
worse here but at some point like I like

6699.88 --> 6706.27
if it would I'd definitely risk yeah

6704.35 --> 6709.27
having things go out of control

6706.27 --> 6711.910000000001
at some point I would just be like okay

6709.27 --> 6715.93
I'm now gonna run into that store

6711.91 --> 6719.32
basically bash anyone out of the way get

6715.93 --> 6721.75
the [ __ ] thing I want drop some money

6719.32 --> 6724.09
on the counter basically say you're

6721.75 --> 6729.28
gonna let me out or I will [ __ ] kill

6724.09 --> 6731.4400000000005
you if yeah if it would get any worse if

6729.28 --> 6733.57
I would be forced to like spend a half

6731.44 --> 6735.849999999999
an hour waiting in a [ __ ] line every

6733.57 --> 6738.28
single time and it would get worse and

6735.85 --> 6743.05
like oh you know Massimo I there's gonna

6738.28 --> 6745.36
be problems man with me I'm so [ __ ]

6743.05 --> 6750.01
intolerant to all this [ __ ] I'm so

6745.36 --> 6754.179999999999
unbelievably intolerant I can't believe

6750.01 --> 6758.2300000000005
that him yeah then it's still just going

6754.18 --> 6760.39
fine out there I have to wait like 450

6758.23 --> 6763.719999999999
minutes in a freaking line because it's

6760.39 --> 6768.22
Korona [ __ ] know that in like a huge

6763.72 --> 6773.26
supermarket 15 minutes for no damn

6768.22 --> 6776.41
reason and it's even it's minor it's a

6773.26 --> 6778.08
minor little thingy and that gets me

6776.41 --> 6783.3099999999995
pissed off already

6778.08 --> 6784.45
now no definitely not a man do not go

6783.31 --> 6795.129000000001
ago for two hours

6784.45 --> 6797.019
no way no I'm gonna do see

6795.129 --> 6800.28
eight more minutes and then I'm gonna

6797.019 --> 6804.839
run out because I'm really hungry and

6800.28 --> 6804.839
I've ran out of tea

6812.76 --> 6820.85
all right yet the debt it's crazy you

6816.96 --> 6823.77
know the way I talk I sound like such a

6820.85 --> 6826.8
super violent guy when I talk like this

6823.77 --> 6829.47
but I all of it is mostly inside it's

6826.8 --> 6831.72
just that I'm not getting to this point

6829.47 --> 6837.780000000001
that I'm like getting really seduced it

6831.72 --> 6841.34
just exerts absolute dominance just say

6837.78 --> 6845.96
no I'm gonna get that [ __ ] thing

6841.34 --> 6848.88
you're not gonna make me do anything and

6845.96 --> 6852.3
yeah if you're gonna try to stop me I

6848.88 --> 6853.86
will assault you and then still get away

6852.3 --> 6858.03
before any [ __ ] police would get

6853.86 --> 6860.5199999999995
there because I can I just [ __ ]

6858.03 --> 6863.4
intimidate them like you get out of my

6860.52 --> 6865.5
[ __ ] way right now I'm gonna get this

6863.4 --> 6868.91
thing I'm gonna pay you for it and I'm

6865.5 --> 6868.91
gonna do it at my pace

6876.42 --> 6881.01
and I don't know man I think that if I

6879.15 --> 6885.049999999999
do that completely on my own it would

6881.01 --> 6889.05
probably not work but I don't know man

6885.05 --> 6891.51
what would it be that far outside of any

6889.05 --> 6893.1900000000005
you have this view in the United States

6891.51 --> 6896.1
is probably gonna get crazy if you do it

6893.19 --> 6899.94
at be almost like yeah just go to a

6896.1 --> 6903.450000000001
store and just say no we're taking over

6899.94 --> 6907.169999999999
we're not stealing anything but you are

6903.45 --> 6909.36
now going to seize this stupid activity

6907.17 --> 6911.22
you are not gonna force people to wear

6909.36 --> 6913.2
masks you are not gonna force people to

6911.22 --> 6917.1900000000005
social distance you're not gonna force

6913.2 --> 6920.67
people to do anything you're just gonna

6917.19 --> 6922.139999999999
run the store because we say so if you

6920.67 --> 6926.54
got a problem with it then send your

6922.14 --> 6926.54
manager and we'll give him the same talk

6929.81 --> 6934.1900000000005
but you need a group of people for that

6934.64 --> 6940.5
it would be almost like a yeah public

6938.34 --> 6942.8
takeover like no you're just gonna

6940.5 --> 6947.06
function as the normal [ __ ] store

6942.8 --> 6947.06
you're not gonna do this [ __ ] anymore

6947.81 --> 6955.8
look at ya public hostile takeover not

6951.18 --> 6959.21
not to rub it but just to say you'd like

6955.8 --> 6959.21
you're gonna stop this right now

6962.69 --> 6967.759999999999
all george sanford that's the other way

6965.03 --> 6969.8
to do it yeah but what if if there's

6967.76 --> 6973.219
just one big store there and that's the

6969.8 --> 6975.969
only thing that's there you know what if

6973.219 --> 6975.969
you have no other choice

6982.61 --> 6991.17
all right I don't know I maybe this is

6988.08 --> 6994.29
an absolutely stupid idea maybe maybe it

6991.17 --> 6999.4800000000005
has some viability but like a militia

6994.29 --> 7001.94
takeover it's just like no the [ __ ]

6999.48 --> 7005.799999999999
imposed from top down is gonna stop down

7001.94 --> 7008.509999999999
where the militia and we're just gonna

7005.8 --> 7010.72
ensure that everything is gonna run as

7008.51 --> 7010.72
normal

7011.02 --> 7014.200000000001
something like that

7019.679 --> 7025.679
I don't know maybe this is just the

7021.78 --> 7029.15
worst idea ever I'm a bit all over the

7025.679 --> 7029.15
place at last half hour now

7046.88 --> 7052.7
yes sanitizer yeah I don't touch that

7049.28 --> 7055.66
[ __ ] rubbing my hands with alcohol piss

7052.7 --> 7061.4
off man no [ __ ] way

7055.66 --> 7063.65
no I very demonstratively gums like if

7061.4 --> 7066.53
somebody then people know better to do

7063.65 --> 7069.5
that then a guy looking like me wearing

7066.53 --> 7071.48
a black leather trench coat type of

7069.5 --> 7074.18
thing yeah they know better Timmy then

7071.48 --> 7077.54
look where you don't really miss yeah do

7074.18 --> 7081.530000000001
this [ __ ] their pants before they try

7077.54 --> 7084.14
anything like that because yeah I am

7081.53 --> 7086.179999999999
pissed off and I do look kind of timid

7084.14 --> 7088.9400000000005
intimidating in general that's something

7086.18 --> 7090.950000000001
really happy then it doesn't look so

7088.94 --> 7093.11
intimidating but when I'm pissed off

7090.95 --> 7095.57
yeah that's [ __ ] intimidating so

7093.11 --> 7100.46
nobody confronts me with that [ __ ] so

7095.57 --> 7104.36
far and I don't know the most places

7100.46 --> 7107.12
that I really go to they're the measures

7104.36 --> 7109.28
there are so minimal there so minimal

7107.12 --> 7113.8
that I barely notice it's just kind of

7109.28 --> 7113.8
annoying like a slight nuisance

7131.409 --> 7142.058999999999
when people holding the table stand up

7134.289 --> 7143.489
there game crashes maybe but yeah you'll

7142.059 --> 7146.320000000001
crash too you know

7143.489 --> 7148.78
don't forget that the entire societal

7146.32 --> 7151.539
set up most of it is kind of still

7148.78 --> 7155.409
dependent on the flow of for these

7151.539 --> 7160.059
things like only the completely

7155.409 --> 7162.549999999999
independent like those that could

7160.059 --> 7165.88
provide their own food literally on the

7162.55 --> 7168.01
spot on a daily basis those are the only

7165.88 --> 7171.959
ones that can really get away from this

7168.01 --> 7175.209
even if it crashes because if if we just

7171.959 --> 7177.51
make the system crash to try to sweat

7175.209 --> 7183.989
out the corona nonsense corporate wise

7177.51 --> 7183.9890000000005
then ads still gonna crash you know I

7186.869 --> 7195.039
may be maybe at this point having just a

7192.429 --> 7199.269
militia take over of the country and

7195.039 --> 7202.809
just saying like no this Corona is now

7199.269 --> 7204.639
ending this policy is now ending we

7202.809 --> 7206.8
don't give a [ __ ] about what they say on

7204.639 --> 7209.9490000000005
TV we don't give a [ __ ] about what you

7206.8 --> 7214.229
orders you got from your mayor or

7209.949 --> 7218.079
whatever this is going to stop now and

7214.229 --> 7221.909000000001
it's going to continue as if nothing

7218.079 --> 7225.489
ever happened which it didn't by the way

7221.909 --> 7226.478999999999
literally nothing nothing ever happened

7225.489 --> 7229.9
ever

7226.479 --> 7232.329000000001
there was nothing it's all artificial

7229.9 --> 7236.11
it's all talk all of it

7232.329 --> 7243.308999999999
nothing not a thing a singular thing

7236.11 --> 7246.78
nothing never was so militia take over

7243.309 --> 7253.150000000001
and just force the continuations like no

7246.78 --> 7256.268999999999
corporate [ __ ] federal mind control

7253.15 --> 7257.949
[ __ ] media we don't care we are

7256.269 --> 7260.139
going to ensure that everything

7257.949 --> 7264.3099999999995
continues as if nothing ever happened

7260.139 --> 7267.49
because it didn't maybe that is like

7264.31 --> 7271.63
the only way to completely avert a a

7267.49 --> 7273.91
real crash because any other approach is

7271.63 --> 7277.86
gonna just make it crash one way or the

7273.91 --> 7277.86
other it will

7289.5 --> 7295.42
when you think about it talk for two

7293.71 --> 7297.31
hours about different topics and

7295.42 --> 7299.62
interacting with chat continuously must

7297.31 --> 7304.18
be stressful well hm

7299.62 --> 7306.07
it can be but ya know it's been fine I

7304.18 --> 7308.950000000001
feel pretty good the only issue is I get

7306.07 --> 7311.469999999999
kind of hungry after all and I haven't

7308.95 --> 7314.86
had real breakfast yet because I didn't

7311.47 --> 7317.08
get up that early because when I get up

7314.86 --> 7320.86
really early then I tend to have like

7317.08 --> 7322.8
breakfast before but I didn't get to

7320.86 --> 7326.71
that

7322.8 --> 7329.2300000000005
yeah the trolls were kind of yeah well

7326.71 --> 7331.06
if I get bombarded by trolls or if

7329.23 --> 7333.759999999999
everybody for some reason seems

7331.06 --> 7335.530000000001
disinterested or just bickering back and

7333.76 --> 7338.4400000000005
forth with one another in chat that can

7335.53 --> 7340.21
be stressful well everybody's being

7338.44 --> 7343.599999999999
great in shed and I got the donations

7340.21 --> 7344.95
and all everybody's onto the things with

7343.6 --> 7346.6
their minds what I'm talking about

7344.95 --> 7350.7699999999995
everybody's responding so it's great I

7346.6 --> 7359.950000000001
know it is yeah I could potentially keep

7350.77 --> 7362.35
going I'm just really hungry that's been

7359.95 --> 7366.42
gone for two hours now right right

7362.35 --> 7366.42
yeah okay live them more than that

7374.419 --> 7380.289
yeah it's been pretty good except for

7376.76 --> 7382.639
the trolls what

7380.289 --> 7385.969
yeah good subjects it got a little

7382.639 --> 7389.7390000000005
aggressive today I guess I got very

7385.969 --> 7389.7390000000005
uncomfortable every time I go there

7391.389 --> 7401.169
because yeah that aggression is really

7395.05 --> 7405.38
it comes from just the aggression but

7401.169 --> 7408.32
what I want effectively he usually

7405.38 --> 7410.899
doesn't the aggression doesn't really

7408.32 --> 7413.11
help with that you know like even the

7410.899 --> 7416.119000000001
concept of a militia takeover of stores

7413.11 --> 7421.058999999999
the actual aggression would not be good

7416.119 --> 7424.999
at all no it's it's more like just

7421.059 --> 7428.499
dominance and decision but any

7424.999 --> 7436.03
aggression would only aggravate things

7428.499 --> 7436.03
in such a endeavour in such a attempt

7450.02 --> 7463.820000000001
hmm system based on that oil crash

7455.86 --> 7466.099999999999
well it might unless you literally kind

7463.82 --> 7470.9
of default it you know the system is

7466.1 --> 7474.410000000001
basically a directional stream the

7470.9 --> 7478.389999999999
entire money system and like fabrication

7474.41 --> 7482.12
making money trade it's a stream and

7478.39 --> 7485.6
yeah that depth keeps on bloating up

7482.12 --> 7490.01
eventually disrupting the stream but if

7485.6 --> 7492.650000000001
you could potentially break it away it's

7490.01 --> 7494.75
it has consequences major consequences

7492.65 --> 7499.25
probably some things that we don't even

7494.75 --> 7500.96
understand but if you kind of default it

7499.25 --> 7505.15
would have those consequences but things

7500.96 --> 7511.67
would still be streaming except the

7505.15 --> 7514.009999999999
backdrop would change what's driving

7511.67 --> 7516.62
things the mechanism and how that

7514.01 --> 7520.7300000000005
unfolds unto society would change

7516.62 --> 7523.46
slightly but it really always was about

7520.73 --> 7526.28
the flow of things like actual money

7523.46 --> 7529.04
printing and stimulus you know it's only

7526.28 --> 7531.65
about keeping the flow going not about

7529.04 --> 7533.42
the amounts really in the end it's about

7531.65 --> 7538.929999999999
keeping the flow going that's the real

7533.42 --> 7543.9400000000005
economy not the amounts really reality

7538.93 --> 7547.52
the mounds come and go they can have no

7543.94 --> 7552.139999999999
impact potentially even if it was huge

7547.52 --> 7555.14
sums or they could be extremely stable

7552.14 --> 7558.650000000001
little amounts depending on what the

7555.14 --> 7560.450000000001
economy element is somebody's like very

7558.65 --> 7562.82
dedicated to something and has a

7560.45 --> 7565.28
cornered thing and it's like very driven

7562.82 --> 7568.04
to uphold that then that will be very

7565.28 --> 7571.88
stable no matter even if it isn't a lot

7568.04 --> 7574.5199999999995
of money so see it's all about the

7571.88 --> 7576.32
economy is all about the flow of things

7574.52 --> 7580.13
and that it keeps flowing that's the

7576.32 --> 7582.539
really the real factor the debt as those

7580.13 --> 7586.309
are all conceptual backdrop things

7582.539 --> 7590.518999999999
and yeah they are being used to drive

7586.309 --> 7593.28
policies into some virtual direction but

7590.519 --> 7596.030000000001
it effectively the only real economy is

7593.28 --> 7596.03
the flow

7604.649 --> 7610.169000000001
issues shared in risk-based endeavors

7607.829 --> 7614.129
only harm comes to the investors not the

7610.169 --> 7620.51
population at large that's that would be

7614.129 --> 7625.8
ideal although in in practice you know

7620.51 --> 7627.749
problem is is the if there is yeah but

7625.8 --> 7629.849
the rules I don't know man the rules

7627.749 --> 7630.989
concerning financial markets and all

7629.849 --> 7632.84
that and how money is made

7630.989 --> 7635.129
yeah that's sure there's a lot of

7632.84 --> 7641.01
maneuvering room and there's a lot to be

7635.129 --> 7643.409
that should be changed that those are

7641.01 --> 7647.4490000000005
not that I don't know a lot about how

7643.409 --> 7647.449
that all works the details of that I

7648.26 --> 7653.76
don't have a lot of detail over citing

7650.76 --> 7654.479
that because I don't really know a lot

7653.76 --> 7658.019
of workings

7654.479 --> 7661.349
I just size up things and then hope I

7658.019 --> 7663.539000000001
get it right every single time then

7661.349 --> 7667.379
afterward figure out how much of it I

7663.539 --> 7669.209
got right how close I was and I love to

7667.379 --> 7672.809
be corrected you know I love to be

7669.209 --> 7675.229
corrected by people that are like in the

7672.809 --> 7678.719
exact thing that I'm talking about and

7675.229 --> 7682.320000000001
that I'm slightly off you know I'd love

7678.719 --> 7685.59
to be told by those people that have

7682.32 --> 7688.259999999999
more close-up experience in those fields

7685.59 --> 7691.139
and all that I want to know I want to

7688.26 --> 7695.129
size it up right so if I get something

7691.139 --> 7699.809
wrong and you know it please don't hold

7695.129 --> 7701.999
back but you gotta know for sure it's

7699.809 --> 7705.26
