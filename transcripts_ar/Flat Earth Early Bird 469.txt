much appreciated so yeah today the

65.81 --> 73.16
weather again it's completely different

69.56 --> 77.619
it's just it's no real big clouds or

73.16 --> 80.63
anything no rain just seems to be this

77.619 --> 85.34
yeah just one big great cloud Bank out

80.63 --> 96.619
there so it's not really that cold even

85.34 --> 103.75
there's no wind it's just great yeah

96.619 --> 106.729
it's no smoke it's just just cloudy or

103.75 --> 108.35
thin clouds but everywhere I don't think

106.729 --> 113.479
it's chemtrails either I don't know what

108.35 --> 115.83999999999999
it is exactly it's just typical yeah

113.479 --> 118.42
these types of weather days have been

115.84 --> 123.53
been there before in the last month so

118.42 --> 130.97
nothing special anyway let's see who's

123.53 --> 137.68
in chat I got green tea way yeah a GM

130.97 --> 142.39
was first tank over moco Tom Parker

137.68 --> 142.39000000000001
Giulio Pavan more colored

143.29 --> 151.629
yeah good CEO first view and yeah

148.09 --> 155.579
slipping in because I get kind of house

151.629 --> 158.10999999999999
sarita Cosentino right yeah good morning

155.579 --> 160.54000000000002
because I started up the or I rather

158.11 --> 164.89000000000001
open up the hangout to be a hangout

160.54 --> 167.409
pretty much a minute before - so yeah

164.89 --> 168.76
usually when I do that people drop in a

167.409 --> 171.7
little later because people don't get

168.76 --> 182.5
the free notifications if they get any I

171.7 --> 185.42999999999998
don't even know if they do but so how

182.5 --> 185.43
are you all doing

193.61 --> 204.64000000000001
hmm right yeah I've been quite active

199.91 --> 207.5
yesterday since what did I do

204.64 --> 208.27999999999997
letters debates was not super on the

207.5 --> 213.98
forefront

208.28 --> 215.48
didn't really need to write oh yeah and

213.98 --> 217.92999999999998
then afterward at some point I don't

215.48 --> 224.17
even remember how late that was but I

217.93 --> 227.93
got onto the 24/7 letter discord channel

224.17 --> 232.22
and it was active for quite a while

227.93 --> 232.43
there I think Amanda young picked that

232.22 --> 234.02
up

232.43 --> 237.89000000000001
oh yeah chocolate Satan was in there as

234.02 --> 241.67000000000002
well for a few moments but I was yeah I

237.89 --> 248.83999999999997
was quite on a roll it started out kind

241.67 --> 252.25
of yeah putting down some basically some

248.84 --> 255.95000000000002
attack on a specific troll that's just

252.25 --> 258.83
yeah it's gone the same path as Trish

255.95 --> 262.58
Blythe pretty much I could compare it to

258.83 --> 265.03999999999996
that type of character progress that

262.58 --> 266.87
progress right so I'm not even gonna

265.04 --> 271.22
mention his name but yeah everywhere

266.87 --> 275.78000000000003
else I go he's all wet he's like the

271.22 --> 277.66900000000004
worst troll now ever and he's like seems

275.78 --> 279.26
like negatively upset I think he like

277.669 --> 286.4
wants to beat me up or something

279.26 --> 289.33
and yeah it's mutual so because it just

286.4 --> 289.33
won't let it go

290.38 --> 295.21999999999997
that makes me want to psionically

293.15 --> 298.15999999999997
strangle him which is kind of what I did

295.22 --> 301.09000000000003
because I put down a half-hour rant

298.16 --> 304.94
pretty much straight out exposing his

301.09 --> 309.27
character and his deepest struggle that

304.94 --> 312.06
he wants no one to see and yeah

309.27 --> 314.81899999999996
as expected he went completely apeshit

312.06 --> 317.25
in chat pretty much ever after

314.819 --> 319.53000000000003
non-stop attacking my character for like

317.25 --> 323.55
an hour even half an hour after we

319.53 --> 326.669
stopped talking about him just kept it

323.55 --> 332.31
up I really really seriously triggered

326.669 --> 334.40999999999997
him not that I'm proud of that I just

332.31 --> 336.479
want people like that just because

334.41 --> 338.78900000000004
they're not they're not gonna progress

336.479 --> 341.25
it's blatantly out they they don't want

338.789 --> 344.639
to they're just gonna [ __ ] all over

341.25 --> 346.62
anything so maybe the best course for

344.639 --> 355.28000000000003
those type of individuals is to just

346.62 --> 355.28000000000003
burn themselves out so yeah

356.88 --> 363.03
you know who good servant he's been in

361.08 --> 365.84999999999997
here as well he was super chatted me

363.03 --> 371.4
what some time ago and then he went

365.85 --> 373.70000000000005
completely nuts I think it was over him

371.4 --> 378.32
criticizing Owen Benjamin for something

373.7 --> 383.76
calling him a shill or something stupid

378.32 --> 393.56
no not even no Ivan is just the Marxist

383.76 --> 397.03999999999996
weirdo anyway it doesn't really matter I

393.56 --> 403.53000000000003
was quite active there

397.04 --> 411.17
yeah George caught it I think he was

403.53 --> 415.85999999999996
there in jet anyway yeah we had this -

411.17 --> 418.44
we had a or we not me and him but other

415.86 --> 424.47
because he the guy doesn't even come out

418.44 --> 427.38
yet he's just you know anyway I had

424.47 --> 432.39000000000004
conversation there with was a lemon bird

427.38 --> 434.55
and we had a lady I don't I don't really

432.39 --> 438.05
know any of them that well except for

434.55 --> 441.09000000000003
lemon Bert used to be called owl Wraith

438.05 --> 449.57
and it was a really good conversation

441.09 --> 449.57
and talked about a lot of things

450.08 --> 456.39
psychological things I don't remember

453.93 --> 460.7
every single detail what we talked about

456.39 --> 460.7
because after that I just moved on and I

460.85 --> 465.90000000000003
think mostly we were talking about the

463.74 --> 468.87
mechanics of mind control and how the

465.9 --> 472.40999999999997
typical and aware person responds to

468.87 --> 475.98
that I've been into that a lot recently

472.41 --> 481.11
I know it's like my new condensed

475.98 --> 484.55
project because it is extremely

481.11 --> 489.0
difficult to explain the interest the

484.55 --> 490.529
intricacies of the fooled mind it's very

489.0 --> 494.629
difficult to explain

490.529 --> 496.649
without resorting to frustration driven

494.629 --> 498.97900000000004
oversimplification because that is what

496.649 --> 502.799
everybody tends to do on in general

498.979 --> 506.50899999999996
because it is just so bizarre what these

502.799 --> 509.849
people have contracted themselves into

506.509 --> 512.129
the puzzle that they've contracted like

509.849 --> 520.649
a disease well it's not really yeah it's

512.129 --> 523.889
just like a spell so yeah I've always

520.649 --> 525.209
found mind dwellings and what happens

523.889 --> 527.569
and what happens to the consciousness

525.209 --> 530.16
very interesting and fascinating as a

527.569 --> 535.92
phenomena by itself as a human phenomena

530.16 --> 540.899
and so I I talk about it try to see it

535.92 --> 543.059
how it works and well find a way to more

540.899 --> 545.519
effectively break it to the / - really

543.059 --> 548.579
dispel it on the spot instead of just

545.519 --> 551.73
causing the standard reaction for the

548.579 --> 554.8789999999999
person to wander off and dwell in their

551.73 --> 557.519
own in their own in their own delusions

554.879 --> 559.86
because that's usually what happens with

557.519 --> 564.6
people that have that are driven by

559.86 --> 567.569
delusion so but my idea is maybe if we

564.6 --> 571.7090000000001
could truly put down the picture so

567.569 --> 575.79
perfect that it cannot be unseen as it

571.709 --> 579.5889999999999
were that it'll just dispelled the whole

575.79 --> 585.529
situation to them maybe I don't know

579.589 --> 588.1800000000001
it's just a feeling I guess in a way

585.529 --> 593.459
from my own experience I could conclude

588.18 --> 596.7299999999999
that it doesn't it it's not the ultimate

593.459 --> 599.399
solution to do that because I myself

596.73 --> 605.339
have been confronted over my lifetime

599.399 --> 607.92
many times with very harsh realities as

605.339 --> 609.72
it were or well realities with the code

607.92 --> 611.91
of painting on them to kind of nudge

609.72 --> 615.24
them a little bit more into a certain

611.91 --> 618.389
direction but even without the paint I

615.24 --> 622.24
just would not accept it so I was in

618.389 --> 624.37
this in my own spells as

622.24 --> 627.16
own way but it was there to protect me

624.37 --> 631.93
because what I was trying to develop him

627.16 --> 641.4699999999999
myself simply could not touch to that

631.93 --> 643.27
level or it would shatter apart but yeah

641.47 --> 645.9100000000001
now I'm talking about processes that

643.27 --> 646.63
have happened in the last 20 years or

645.91 --> 652.6899999999999
more

646.63 --> 656.92
30 years rather so I don't know if what

652.69 --> 659.4100000000001
I experienced during my yeah previous

656.92 --> 661.18
time in my life if if if the situation

659.41 --> 662.529
could even be compared anymore because

661.18 --> 665.1999999999999
we didn't have the Internet

662.529 --> 668.92
not to this level not like this nobody

665.2 --> 671.1400000000001
really knew what was coming a few techno

668.92 --> 673.26
Wizards early techno they knew what was

671.14 --> 676.39
coming they knew it

673.26 --> 678.55
other people had no idea they thought oh

676.39 --> 680.62
wow information it really could find

678.55 --> 683.25
anything but they would only see that

680.62 --> 686.44
the superficial consequence is the ease

683.25 --> 689.02
easy contact all that and the trolling

686.44 --> 692.62
even PSA's people saw that coming but I

689.02 --> 696.579
didn't understand yet how it the

692.62 --> 699.3100000000001
constant acceleration of connection does

696.579 --> 702.55
other things as well and kind of helps

699.31 --> 706.0889999999999
to raise consciousness even and an

702.55 --> 710.459
insight so that's what I'm pointing at

706.089 --> 712.2090000000001
right now oh wow thanks Giulio Pavan

710.459 --> 717.01
that's very nice

712.209 --> 719.25
I'll check it out hmm it's a nice

717.01 --> 719.25
surprise

723.889 --> 726.889
and thanks for the superjet donation as

726.109 --> 734.4200000000001
well right away

726.889 --> 737.239
oh nice 20 euros thank you

734.42 --> 740.3789999999999
Giulio Pavan for the generous donation

737.239 --> 740.379
thank you very much

740.41 --> 749.749
that's awesome and ya can definitely use

745.1 --> 755.509
it I'm not in any danger zone yet but I

749.749 --> 757.4590000000001
know how it works like especially from a

755.509 --> 762.259
week from now it's always typically the

757.459 --> 763.939
same anyway thank you so much for the

762.259 --> 768.379
tubular ship which at the nation and the

763.939 --> 774.23
paypal very very much appreciated where

768.379 --> 778.04
was I right

774.23 --> 780.619
the unexpected consciousness ascension

778.04 --> 785.66
as a side effect of advanced internet

780.619 --> 788.4490000000001
social media and all that and well what

785.66 --> 790.9699999999999
is very much up front and almost like a

788.449 --> 793.6099999999999
culture is the trolling is the

790.97 --> 796.5400000000001
misbehavior is the overreaction is the

793.61 --> 801.879
over dramatization is the attention

796.54 --> 805.399
desperate attention whining like up to

801.879 --> 808.089
just maniacal levels that is kind of

805.399 --> 810.949
what we see that's the exoteric

808.089 --> 813.649
basically the garbage that is excreted

810.949 --> 816.919
on the outside so that is the more

813.649 --> 820.149
visible part you know you always see the

816.919 --> 823.879
darkness first in a complex process I

820.149 --> 828.049
gotta remember that but at the same time

823.879 --> 831.259
people that have learned to not become

828.049 --> 833.899
that not become the the excreted junk

831.259 --> 837.86
that is very visible that have actually

833.899 --> 842.239
moved beyond they suddenly have rooms in

837.86 --> 846.23
their minds and they can certainly use

842.239 --> 849.22
that room to a much an unexpected level

846.23 --> 852.5500000000001
of freedom even within and

849.22 --> 855.73
potentially traps kind of life you know

852.55 --> 858.99
through the internet the mind has more

855.73 --> 861.73
freedom than it could have without it

858.99 --> 863.7090000000001
because of the just how far you can

861.73 --> 869.1
reach and what you can find if you're

863.709 --> 869.0999999999999
looking and that has caused this

869.279 --> 877.899
consciousness ascension or it helped it

872.55 --> 884.2199999999999
it definitely helped it and we should

877.899 --> 887.41
use that while it's still there because

884.22 --> 890.9490000000001
just because we see and we know how

887.41 --> 894.85
precious these these opportunities have

890.949 --> 899.05
been this open Internet has been does

894.85 --> 902.8290000000001
not mean that it will not be taken away

899.05 --> 908.92
from us at some point if we don't

902.829 --> 913.779
prevent that because the Ascension in

908.92 --> 917.139
essence benefits the ascending the most

913.779 --> 919.389
and those that are really the

917.139 --> 921.279
controller's they have went through

919.389 --> 923.86
their consciousness ascension and went

921.279 --> 929.43
through falling in all the contracts so

923.86 --> 932.889
they do not have that freedom and that

929.43 --> 935.55
kind of causes a ego in balance and

932.889 --> 940.36
that's the problem in the long run so

935.55 --> 942.49
while the light ones ascend the dark

940.36 --> 946.98
ones grow more Restless and more

942.49 --> 950.4300000000001
agitated they don't think we deserve it

946.98 --> 955.36
because we have not given up everything

950.43 --> 957.819
to get control that line of thought that

955.36 --> 960.4300000000001
reasoning technically doesn't make sense

957.819 --> 963.67
but it makes sense to them because they

960.43 --> 967.42
don't see beyond that level anymore

963.67 --> 970.569
because it's all been destroyed to

967.42 --> 975.3
maintain control it's been handed over

970.569 --> 981.26
to a machine

975.3 --> 990.12
so just trying to point out the settings

981.26 --> 995.8389999999999
for this conscious awakening hmm right I

990.12 --> 1001.07
also saw a pretty good video today yeah

995.839 --> 1003.23
an elaborate video concerning chemtrails

1001.07 --> 1006.86
they were centered mostly around that

1003.23 --> 1010.3100000000001
but it was not just exclusive only

1006.86 --> 1013.4300000000001
chemtrails it was very deep wide video

1010.31 --> 1016.88
with a lot of reference a lot of video

1013.43 --> 1020.63
material it was from research Flat Earth

1016.88 --> 1021.4399999999999
that channel and the video is called

1020.63 --> 1023.57
look up

1021.44 --> 1028.49
I even downloaded to my computer because

1023.57 --> 1030.429
it was that good and I'm gonna post it

1028.49 --> 1036.17
in chat so you can check it out as well

1030.429 --> 1040.3390000000002
it is kind of unnerving in a way it is

1036.17 --> 1045.319
really a reminder how how much of the

1040.339 --> 1048.23
chemtrail sayings that are going around

1045.319 --> 1050.36
just all the super people that kind of

1048.23 --> 1053.51
believe in chemtrails did not have even

1050.36 --> 1054.77
not necessarily even dug through all the

1053.51 --> 1056.89
things that have happened have all the

1054.77 --> 1059.57
video much but just on the surface

1056.89 --> 1064.01
people kind of echo these things but

1059.57 --> 1066.4099999999999
this video shows you where a lot of

1064.01 --> 1070.8799999999999
those things come from it is a very

1066.41 --> 1073.16
condensed video with a lot deep reaching

1070.88 --> 1074.96
info and I definitely recommend you

1073.16 --> 1078.94
watch it it is not even half an hour

1074.96 --> 1078.94
long very much worth it

1082.39 --> 1087.1100000000001
yeah that is the end of the video

1085.07 --> 1089.1499999999999
approach I got a bit unnerved I haven't

1087.11 --> 1094.27
completely finished it yet I'm now at

1089.15 --> 1097.72
the 23 minute marker and there's still

1094.27 --> 1100.1299999999999
roughly five more minutes

1097.72 --> 1103.79
but yeah I wasn't impressed by that

1100.13 --> 1106.94
video so check it out on a research Flat

1103.79 --> 1109.36
Earth channel don't I don't exactly know

1106.94 --> 1112.4
even who it is but he has some he or she

1109.36 --> 1114.6699999999998
diggity of really good videos every now

1112.4 --> 1114.67
and then

1121.34 --> 1133.12
Oh hahaha how funny I am funny

1148.57 --> 1153.6789999999999
anyway I'm gonna now seriously look in

1151.07 --> 1158.08
chat I've talked for twenty minutes on

1153.679 --> 1158.0800000000002
end let's see what you guys are saying

1175.24 --> 1182.679
a GM stop the potty mouth I mean it if

1181.57 --> 1190.08
you're in that kind of mood and then

1182.679 --> 1190.0800000000002
please just don't touch your keyboard

1200.39 --> 1203.5690000000002
[Music]

1210.5 --> 1217.66
Oh matrix but that is a mirror of a

1213.32 --> 1223.72
video fish matrix whose fish matrix I

1217.66 --> 1223.72
never heard of that huh

1229.84 --> 1237.52
it it didn't say the channel didn't say

1234.82 --> 1245.4399999999998
it was a mirror so I didn't assume it

1237.52 --> 1250.24
was but the link doesn't work what it

1245.44 --> 1252.99
should work let me post it again in

1250.24 --> 1252.99
another format

1259.67 --> 1267.67
what is this thang what did you link

1263.6 --> 1267.6699999999998
yeah that video doesn't work

1279.15 --> 1286.5590000000002
all right yeah vaccines yeah yeah yeah

1282.18 --> 1289.65
oh this movie or the video that I linked

1286.559 --> 1295.02
to also addresses a little of that I

1289.65 --> 1300.75
think yeah I tried it DANC I see it it's

1295.02 --> 1312.54
a sitting in video doc us so I don't

1300.75 --> 1314.73
know what that is but I see it's a DD DD

1312.54 --> 1316.97
tachometer is this her channel I don't

1314.73 --> 1316.97
know

1321.95 --> 1325.339
[Music]

1332.97 --> 1335.97
hmm

1347.85 --> 1353.049
george sanford tim trees could be cover

1351.22 --> 1355.299
for something much more deep

1353.049 --> 1357.039
yeah and underneath that layer is

1355.299 --> 1358.87
another layer and underneath that layer

1357.039 --> 1360.52
is another layer underneath that layer

1358.87 --> 1362.62
is another layer and then when that

1360.52 --> 1365.4089999999999
layer is lifted up it'll be revealed

1362.62 --> 1370.1689999999999
that everything ever you've ever

1365.409 --> 1373.5100000000002
experienced was all one giant illusion

1370.169 --> 1378.3700000000001
everything from the moment you were born

1373.51 --> 1382.62
how about that is that does that help

1378.37 --> 1386.62
you when i put that down

1382.62 --> 1388.9799999999998
is that a fruitful trainer thinking to

1386.62 --> 1392.1699999999998
go down that path

1402.17 --> 1406.88
[Music]

1403.48 --> 1412.1200000000001
how about that every word every thought

1406.88 --> 1416.45
every sound every smell every sense

1412.12 --> 1418.3999999999999
every concept everything ever was all an

1416.45 --> 1420.74
illusion how about that is that

1418.4 --> 1423.23
something that would be good to ponder

1420.74 --> 1430.72
on that is that gonna help the

1423.23 --> 1444.65
experience think about it

1430.72 --> 1444.65
[Music]

1445.38 --> 1451.74
yeah but look all the things that are

1449.2 --> 1455.64
done all of the the chemtrails and

1451.74 --> 1459.51
vaccines and even the climate alarmism

1455.64 --> 1463.24
nonsense all of it you see the surface

1459.51 --> 1464.68
draw the conclusions then you see who is

1463.24 --> 1466.39
in there then you see how they're

1464.68 --> 1468.8200000000002
connected and then you see other layers

1466.39 --> 1474.1000000000001
of motivation then you see what drives

1468.82 --> 1477.1599999999999
them and what controls them and then you

1474.1 --> 1481.3899999999999
see another layer and then you see what

1477.16 --> 1484.15
that control is and then you see where

1481.39 --> 1487.5700000000002
it's all coming from and where it's

1484.15 --> 1497.6200000000001
still going and then there's nothing

1487.57 --> 1504.07
left nothing so what is the point what

1497.62 --> 1509.6499999999999
is the point does it even matter if you

1504.07 --> 1513.7
know all the ways they are using it how

1509.65 --> 1518.8600000000001
about the general setting that they are

1513.7 --> 1521.98
doing it and that all of us are one way

1518.86 --> 1526.09
or the other allowing it to happen one

1521.98 --> 1529.81
way or the other and yeah a wretched

1526.09 --> 1532.54
Nations unites all the people giant

1529.81 --> 1535.36
folks like everyone imagine that

1532.54 --> 1537.34
suddenly all the Liberals and all the

1535.36 --> 1539.83
Conservatives in the world would

1537.34 --> 1543.1899999999998
suddenly all unite in a massive

1539.83 --> 1545.98
realization these chemtrails need to

1543.19 --> 1548.38
stop you are causing climate change you

1545.98 --> 1551.29
are poisoning us you are [ __ ] up our

1548.38 --> 1554.0800000000002
worlds and our minds guess what's gonna

1551.29 --> 1556.2
happen you think that's gonna make it

1554.08 --> 1560.76
stop

1556.2 --> 1565.51
see that's the issue

1560.76 --> 1570.21
the only real test is how much will it

1565.51 --> 1570.21
take before it will break

1582.7 --> 1585.819
[Music]

1588.06 --> 1591.56
[Music]

1596.14 --> 1604.5890000000002
[Music]

1611.74 --> 1622.1
the only way to win a battle that you

1616.22 --> 1627.2
cannot win by fighting is by not playing

1622.1 --> 1628.8799999999999
the game but what do you do then well

1627.2 --> 1631.88
guess what that's what we're here to

1628.88 --> 1634.2800000000002
figure out because everything we're

1631.88 --> 1637.16
going to be handed to to us as a

1634.28 --> 1640.43
suggestion what to do is not going to be

1637.16 --> 1652.94
it because it will all be derived from

1640.43 --> 1654.5600000000002
the problem in the first place yeah so

1652.94 --> 1656.6000000000001
we're stuck between a rock and a hard

1654.56 --> 1659.75
place we're stuck between Lucifer and

1656.6 --> 1662.29
our Iman can you find that middle path

1659.75 --> 1666.8
can you find the way through the

1662.29 --> 1670.25
absolutely impossibly in+ impossibly

1666.8 --> 1673.1599999999999
seemingly impossibly complex solution

1670.25 --> 1677.06
that you cannot yet fathom can you find

1673.16 --> 1680.0600000000002
it or are you gonna get bogged in the

1677.06 --> 1686.03
problems handed to you by Lucifer and

1680.06 --> 1689.06
Ahriman are they is that going to take

1686.03 --> 1691.8999999999999
the energy away from actually finding

1689.06 --> 1691.8999999999999
that solution

1701.88 --> 1706.519
[Music]

1707.19 --> 1710.8200000000002
so enough of that

1715.38 --> 1720.419
let's get back to Flat Earth or

1718.02 --> 1724.53
something I see professor Phil Bell is

1720.419 --> 1730.64
here so let's get the back-and-forth

1724.53 --> 1733.08
smacking going because I need a little

1730.64 --> 1735.0
polarization for myself after just

1733.08 --> 1743.36
looking that freaking deep and putting

1735.0 --> 1746.94
it down like that so what do you got

1743.36 --> 1758.3999999999999
satellites in orbit oh god I needed that

1746.94 --> 1760.94
oh that's lovely well

1758.4 --> 1763.3200000000002
look Karen B satellites our balloons oh

1760.94 --> 1766.0800000000002
just think about it professor Phil boss

1763.32 --> 1768.6899999999998
said that is science so specifically

1766.08 --> 1771.51
what satellites is he referring to is he

1768.69 --> 1773.88
referring to the satellites as part of

1771.51 --> 1776.1299999999999
the conceptual framework of how the

1773.88 --> 1777.96
world and the universe and everything is

1776.13 --> 1783.0800000000002
supposed to work according to him in his

1777.96 --> 1787.89
mind or does he actually have real-world

1783.08 --> 1790.47
examples with empirical proof beyond he

1787.89 --> 1795.8700000000001
used to build one and then he believes

1790.47 --> 1798.84
it was launched in a rocket so that

1795.87 --> 1803.27
would be good to hear professor Phil

1798.84 --> 1803.27
Bell if you got anything beyond that

1807.809 --> 1813.399
yeah I'm not even gonna address the

1810.159 --> 1816.249
concept of signs with that because look

1813.399 --> 1820.4499999999998
science is the scientific method but

1816.249 --> 1825.07
yeah since futurism you know it's just

1820.45 --> 1827.5900000000001
that the Western society or you know I

1825.07 --> 1832.989
mean those people they literally just

1827.59 --> 1836.559
kidnapped raped and enslaved the world

1832.989 --> 1840.1290000000001
science to become a cultural phenomena

1836.559 --> 1846.1589999999999
as part of keeping the general public

1840.129 --> 1848.889
spell bound to the futurism illusion so

1846.159 --> 1853.179
yeah of course they're always gonna call

1848.889 --> 1856.2389999999998
it science you got your kid if you keep

1853.179 --> 1858.0700000000002
triggered about that it's just gonna

1856.239 --> 1861.519
hold up everything because they will

1858.07 --> 1863.4089999999999
never concede you know this doesn't

1861.519 --> 1866.559
matter how many times you point them at

1863.409 --> 1868.8690000000001
the facts they will never concede they

1866.559 --> 1871.6589999999999
will always resort back to absolute

1868.869 --> 1876.009
freedom either saying science doesn't

1871.659 --> 1878.019
prove anything or anyone can do science

1876.009 --> 1882.729
science is so easy you can prove

1878.019 --> 1884.95
anything with it you like and then if

1882.729 --> 1886.929
you don't like what somebody's proven

1884.95 --> 1888.909
with sides you just disprove it because

1886.929 --> 1891.969
in the end everything cannot be proven

1888.909 --> 1895.21
with science that is what it is

1891.969 --> 1897.909
and it will not change it's not gonna

1895.21 --> 1902.609
change as long as the globe religion

1897.909 --> 1906.0990000000002
persists that is how it will be forever

1902.609 --> 1908.039
it's never gonna change no matter how

1906.099 --> 1911.499
many times you pointed out how no matter

1908.039 --> 1914.32
how many times we literally show the

1911.499 --> 1919.8890000000001
original text the original it doesn't

1914.32 --> 1919.889
matter they will never concede ever

1922.1 --> 1930.9189999999999
because they need it it's a cornerstone

1925.76 --> 1933.3799999999999
the Scientific Revolution the Cultural

1930.919 --> 1936.89
Revolution stemming from futurism in

1933.38 --> 1939.47
order to unhinge scientific principles

1936.89 --> 1942.1100000000001
into a more conceptual wider fantasy

1939.47 --> 1946.34
room for people to dig into and play

1942.11 --> 1950.36
with it's a critical a critical part of

1946.34 --> 1952.789
maintaining the illusion it's a critical

1950.36 --> 1954.86
foundational part of maintaining the

1952.789 --> 1955.4
globe illusion so it's never gonna

1954.86 --> 1960.4089999999999
change

1955.4 --> 1962.16
ever ever doesn't make it real though it

1960.409 --> 1971.0490000000002
just means it's never gonna go away

1962.16 --> 1971.049
[Music]

1974.64 --> 1978.8290000000002
[Music]

1986.22 --> 1996.309
but yeah you know in the end the real

1991.3 --> 2000.62
science is very very tight a very

1996.309 --> 2004.29
specific and it is kind of the bottom

2000.62 --> 2007.26
skeletal foundation to stabilize all

2004.29 --> 2011.61
knowledge throughout all discoveries and

2007.26 --> 2013.35
to guide engineering in its reality and

2011.61 --> 2020.309
that is basically what rich real

2013.35 --> 2022.4399999999998
scientific method signs is and right

2020.309 --> 2024.6299999999999
there is more than just a scientific

2022.44 --> 2030.41
method just saying there is engineering

2024.63 --> 2033.23
there's testing empiric testing is

2030.41 --> 2035.91
probably one of the most reliable

2033.23 --> 2040.58
methods of gaining knowledge that we

2035.91 --> 2044.25
have beyond the scientific method and

2040.58 --> 2047.55
this is kind of a practical thing and

2044.25 --> 2050.929
even the people that uphold the globe

2047.55 --> 2054.419
know this and they adopted that

2050.929 --> 2059.55
principle as a philosophy in their

2054.419 --> 2062.22
culture it's not the method anyway it's

2059.55 --> 2065.82
not steps no in their culture their

2062.22 --> 2069.62
futurism culture they uphold that

2065.82 --> 2073.2000000000003
principle that yeah we have progress

2069.62 --> 2075.3599999999997
from testing things empirically we don't

2073.2 --> 2078.149
need the scientific method if you heard

2075.36 --> 2082.44
that before anywhere mm-hmm because it's

2078.149 --> 2085.56
real they do that and it does work but

2082.44 --> 2088.83
yeah it doesn't take away that science

2085.56 --> 2090.24
is the scientific method and that it has

2088.83 --> 2095.12
been bypassed

2090.24 --> 2099.72
and manipulated into a broader cultural

2095.12 --> 2104.7
phenomena a myth for people to follow a

2099.72 --> 2107.64
dream and to relinquish their oversight

2104.7 --> 2111.81
to a system they'll keep feeding them

2107.64 --> 2114.54
that dream a giant giant puzzle of an

2111.81 --> 2116.0299999999997
imaginable largeness and incredible

2114.54 --> 2122.99
powers and

2116.03 --> 2127.19
in significance and extremities it's all

2122.99 --> 2131.99
conceptual so therefore it can be like

2127.19 --> 2135.29
that endlessness can potentially exist

2131.99 --> 2145.93
in the imagination just cannot exist in

2135.29 --> 2149.09
reality oh by the way thank you John M

2145.93 --> 2151.5499999999997
for the ten Canadian dollar super chat

2149.09 --> 2153.86
donation continue the fight you see

2151.55 --> 2158.59
right create a bless you from my heart

2153.86 --> 2158.59
thank you nice I can by the way

2169.64 --> 2174.589
that's a science fiction talk in my chat

2172.2 --> 2174.589
I see

2187.98 --> 2194.1
what a strange thing you said they're

2191.52 --> 2197.34
mislead why does NASA always cheer like

2194.1 --> 2205.5899999999997
cheerleaders do they do that oh I don't

2197.34 --> 2208.92
know on the other hand I guess that NASA

2205.59 --> 2212.4500000000003
is kind of directed against kids a lot

2208.92 --> 2215.369
so maybe they're just trying to use

2212.45 --> 2217.3799999999997
engagement strategy if you're cherry if

2215.369 --> 2219.15
you're happy that's gonna rub off from

2217.38 --> 2222.859
little children so maybe that's why the

2219.15 --> 2222.859
reason why they act like cheerleaders

2227.18 --> 2231.68
not sure that it's just a theory

2234.32 --> 2244.53
concepts it's tough to step away from

2236.88 --> 2246.7200000000003
the word theory yeah did you know John

2244.53 --> 2249.27
has been extremely rigorous basically

2246.72 --> 2251.3399999999997
cutting down all other uses of words

2249.27 --> 2255.27
beside the scientific method original

2251.34 --> 2258.4500000000003
one so I would concede that the word

2255.27 --> 2261.6
hypotheses would specifically apply to

2258.45 --> 2267.5699999999997
the scientific method but a theory

2261.6 --> 2270.8399999999997
however I don't agree with that although

2267.57 --> 2276.48
technically it may be valid that he says

2270.84 --> 2279.81
that it's just a theory well it's like

2276.48 --> 2283.47
an it's a framework idea a concept that

2279.81 --> 2286.74
could potentially be tested why would

2283.47 --> 2288.6899999999996
that only be applicable to the

2286.74 --> 2291.1499999999996
scientific method that makes no sense to

2288.69 --> 2297.2400000000002
me like what the hell else are you gonna

2291.15 --> 2300.57
call it then you know what I mean so a

2297.24 --> 2304.3399999999997
theory if it is really a scientific

2300.57 --> 2306.96
theory then it should be set full-out

2304.34 --> 2309.48
should be set full-out every time if

2306.96 --> 2311.2400000000002
it's a scientific theory you got the

2309.48 --> 2314.52
science to back up the theory

2311.24 --> 2317.97
scientifically then it should absolutely

2314.52 --> 2320.119
never be taken out of the saying you

2317.97 --> 2321.7099999999996
should always say scientific theory

2320.119 --> 2324.05
scientific theory

2321.71 --> 2327.75
scientific theory never just theory

2324.05 --> 2330.9300000000003
because Theory basically means

2327.75 --> 2335.39
conceptual framework idea a concept that

2330.93 --> 2337.5299999999997
could potentially be tested potentially

2335.39 --> 2339.33
that's what it means to me I think

2337.53 --> 2341.88
that's what it means to most people even

2339.33 --> 2344.4
intuitively now whether that is good

2341.88 --> 2346.05
that it does that I don't know but

2344.4 --> 2348.96
that's how it seems to work right now

2346.05 --> 2353.01
and I'm just not willing to burn it all

2348.96 --> 2357.63
down in favor of only looking at words

2353.01 --> 2364.619
as they have originally been used just

2357.63 --> 2366.83
this just did I can't do it not like

2364.619 --> 2366.83
that

2369.41 --> 2377.71
but it is very important to not fool

2373.43 --> 2377.71
around with the word theory as a

2377.98 --> 2387.11
scientist or researcher and then just

2382.75 --> 2390.11
mix up a conceptual framework idea that

2387.11 --> 2394.2200000000003
could be tested with an actual

2390.11 --> 2395.8700000000003
scientific hypothesis based theory thus

2394.22 --> 2398.6899999999996
this should be just clear

2395.87 --> 2402.13
distinguishment between them it's very

2398.69 --> 2404.66
frustrating that they can be mixed up

2402.13 --> 2409.6600000000003
and that they are being mixed up it's

2404.66 --> 2413.45
very frustrating because it it kind of

2409.66 --> 2416.95
takes you off the off the sharp focus

2413.45 --> 2421.22
every time that happens it's confusing

2416.95 --> 2423.83
because it it and it takes away the

2421.22 --> 2428.35
clarity of what is really technically

2423.83 --> 2428.35
meant yeah

2429.1 --> 2436.73
good servant yeah I'm more fluent in

2431.78 --> 2439.52
Dutch but I think that I have a wider

2436.73 --> 2441.53
more readily available vocabulary for

2439.52 --> 2445.61
English just because of everything that

2441.53 --> 2450.6800000000003
I've done with it but I'm I can speak

2445.61 --> 2455.98
incredibly quick Dutch really terribly

2450.68 --> 2455.98
quick that don't wanna

2461.46 --> 2465.64
[Music]

2463.23 --> 2467.98
did you guys catch any of that I don't

2465.64 --> 2471.31
know I think I did it in like the after

2467.98 --> 2474.52
show on the debate somewhere I did just

2471.31 --> 2476.859
a few I said a minute of Dutch after

2474.52 --> 2478.96
people started complaining that I would

2476.859 --> 2480.79
always pause so long and then Nathan

2478.96 --> 2483.7
said yeah it's because it's Dutch and

2480.79 --> 2485.14
and said yeah exactly because this is

2483.7 --> 2494.4399999999996
what happens when I talk Dutch you can

2485.14 --> 2498.1299999999997
stop no no I cannot speak Chinese idiom

2494.44 --> 2503.829
it's lame Chinese is not lame but I

2498.13 --> 2507.4500000000003
can't write it was on Nathan's now I'm

2503.829 --> 2507.4500000000003
not gonna curse people in Dutch

2512.17 --> 2520.869
I think Dutch cursing is very vile and

2518.109 --> 2524.049
disgusting when I see Dutch people truly

2520.869 --> 2526.7200000000003
cursing it makes me hate them a lot

2524.049 --> 2527.559
because I think Dutch cursing is pretty

2526.72 --> 2529.93
disgusting

2527.559 --> 2534.369
even compared to English cursing Dutch

2529.93 --> 2541.93
is worse there's more nastiness behind

2534.369 --> 2545.13
it I can't explain it names just my

2541.93 --> 2545.1299999999997
personal experience

2574.41 --> 2581.6499999999996
while Shaun authorial agreed no no set

2578.56 --> 2583.48
light boxes with the solar panels and

2581.65 --> 2586.42
everything that's never I've never seen

2583.48 --> 2590.7400000000002
that come across the moon before there

2586.42 --> 2593.859
are weird things though like the seeming

2590.74 --> 2599.08
metallic spheres that just that kind of

2593.859 --> 2601.869
stuff it's like what is that and to be

2599.08 --> 2606.369
fair I haven't really seen set looms

2601.869 --> 2608.65
either i think thats at loons may simply

2606.369 --> 2611.29
be if they're up there and they might be

2608.65 --> 2616.4500000000003
i think they're literally out of visual

2611.29 --> 2618.609
range and we we can see the sun right we

2616.45 --> 2620.3489999999997
can see the moon right oh yeah they're

2618.609 --> 2624.31
at the edge of vision like I've been

2620.349 --> 2624.9100000000003
saying for three four years and you had

2624.31 --> 2629.29
a vision

2624.91 --> 2633.27
it has limit so yeah what if the you see

2629.29 --> 2636.52
just imagine you're here you have a

2633.27 --> 2638.47
limit of sight bubble around you you

2636.52 --> 2641.589
will see the globe of the heavens on

2638.47 --> 2643.72
them well guess what what if right

2641.589 --> 2645.7599999999998
you're here the bubbles the end of

2643.72 --> 2649.81
fission is there well what if the SEP

2645.76 --> 2651.849
loons hang over here yeah that's gonna

2649.81 --> 2653.71
mean that you're gonna see that moon or

2651.849 --> 2657.5800000000004
the Sun or whatever it's gonna be very

2653.71 --> 2662.71
bright but yeah that thing it's gonna be

2657.58 --> 2666.8199999999997
out of visual range how about that that

2662.71 --> 2669.2200000000003
would make some sort of sense to me okay

2666.82 --> 2669.88
well Chris Barry yeah I have seen Seth

2669.22 --> 2673.24
loons

2669.88 --> 2676.599
too I've seen on the news and like them

2673.24 --> 2679.93
being let up and all that yeah but have

2676.599 --> 2683.17
you ever seen one hanging there in front

2679.93 --> 2684.2799999999997
of the moon or in front of anything no

2683.17 --> 2686.859
never

2684.28 --> 2689.3390000000004
I've never ever seen it ever ever ever

2686.859 --> 2692.5299999999997
ever ever ever ever

2689.339 --> 2694.119
so yeah either there's absolutely

2692.53 --> 2696.88
nothing up there seems very unlikely

2694.119 --> 2700.63
since we have seen balloon launches with

2696.88 --> 2703.54
satellites so the alternative approach

2700.63 --> 2705.9990000000003
to me is they're literally out of sight

2703.54 --> 2710.979
range there is no possible way

2705.999 --> 2713.669
you could see them from the earth that's

2710.979 --> 2715.839
the only thing that makes sense to me

2713.669 --> 2718.179
they're simply going to be at such a

2715.839 --> 2721.839
distance that refraction the real

2718.179 --> 2723.909
refraction is going to blur up things so

2721.839 --> 2726.129
that after a certain point you only see

2723.909 --> 2729.179
a gray soup and a gray soup technically

2726.129 --> 2732.609
means everything that is light wise

2729.179 --> 2735.239
visually there is going to be uniformly

2732.609 --> 2737.949
blurred up into a singular color and

2735.239 --> 2739.959
that's going to be a backdrop so things

2737.949 --> 2742.179
may be there you will just not see them

2739.959 --> 2745.209
I think that is the case and why we

2742.179 --> 2748.2090000000003
don't see set looms up there and why we

2745.209 --> 2751.0589999999997
will never ever even technically be able

2748.209 --> 2753.4289999999996
to see satellites floating up there in

2751.059 --> 2756.1290000000004
orbit even if that was a technical

2753.429 --> 2758.159
possibility because sight does not allow

2756.129 --> 2758.159
it

2761.639 --> 2769.289
hmm right Tom Parker yeah it was awesome

2764.619 --> 2769.289
I know it was epic wasn't it

2774.269 --> 2783.16
no professor Phil Bell do not don't you

2778.869 --> 2784.9
dare take my words out of context to

2783.16 --> 2788.3489999999997
benefit your own little dream

2784.9 --> 2790.69
don't you dare buddy that's not what I

2788.349 --> 2795.059
said at all I was talking about the

2790.69 --> 2798.4
limit vision it's not about how

2795.059 --> 2801.1600000000003
mechanical things and planned structures

2798.4 --> 2802.9900000000002
can work or not work now that's your

2801.16 --> 2805.509
little fantasy I did not even address

2802.99 --> 2807.22
that because I don't need to because it

2805.509 --> 2809.079
wasn't a subject that I was talking

2807.22 --> 2812.23
about I was talking about why don't we

2809.079 --> 2814.809
see it at all anything because it's out

2812.23 --> 2818.41
of this sight limit there's no

2814.809 --> 2821.759
possibility to see beyond that's why I

2818.41 --> 2821.759
think we don't see them

2832.7 --> 2842.0099999999998
really Karen B you did well I've heard

2837.24 --> 2849.39
that like the ISS thing it is so weird I

2842.01 --> 2851.82
I cannot explain that I literally cannot

2849.39 --> 2855.8399999999997
explain what that is why we even saw

2851.82 --> 2857.9100000000003
anything I believe you I've seen some

2855.84 --> 2861.06
weird stuff on YouTube as well but I

2857.91 --> 2863.79
cannot explain it I cannot explain it

2861.06 --> 2866.43
without literally jumping to extremities

2863.79 --> 2869.7
that's just gonna cause most people to

2866.43 --> 2871.68
immediately jump off and say yeah it's a

2869.7 --> 2875.0099999999998
hologram being projected up there and

2871.68 --> 2878.22
it's very advanced it's future high tech

2875.01 --> 2880.11
stuff that is way out of the range of

2878.22 --> 2883.3199999999997
what will ever be allowed to know ever

2880.11 --> 2885.3
so it's just gonna be there and if they

2883.32 --> 2887.7000000000003
stop digging they're never gonna tell us

2885.3 --> 2890.2200000000003
how they do whatever they would rather

2887.7 --> 2893.46
kill every single human being on the

2890.22 --> 2896.9399999999996
world probably no they'll never tell us

2893.46 --> 2901.56
but they may stop doing it they may just

2896.94 --> 2905.64
put the trick back in the box that's

2901.56 --> 2907.23
money I thought on that and I don't

2905.64 --> 2910.2
really need to expand on that because

2907.23 --> 2916.58
other than that I literally cannot

2910.2 --> 2916.58
explain what that is cannot explain it

2917.54 --> 2923.48
except for it there is no other way then

2921.47 --> 2926.6
it has to be trickery of some kind

2923.48 --> 2929.35
because it makes no damn sense

2926.6 --> 2929.35
whatsoever

2930.52 --> 2938.32
no physical sense no optical sense

2934.69 --> 2938.32
doesn't make any sense

2952.96 --> 2959.92
yeah okay made sixty RMC well yeah the

2957.19 --> 2961.869
the orbit videos of what they do with

2959.92 --> 2964.599
the space shuttles and the ISS and all

2961.869 --> 2968.5
that yeah that's I don't know it's like

2964.599 --> 2970.329
a a big project and it's all trickery I

2968.5 --> 2971.68
believe it I believe it's it's gonna be

2970.329 --> 2974.5
models and all that but yeah what else

2971.68 --> 2977.2599999999998
are they gonna do but I'm not really

2974.5 --> 2979.69
concerned about what I'm gonna be shown

2977.26 --> 2983.8590000000004
by them on a screen I'm much more

2979.69 --> 2987.609
concerned about how my eyes actually

2983.859 --> 2990.93
work and what I can see with them in the

2987.609 --> 2990.93
world not on a screen

3010.25 --> 3014.68
I don't know if letter spaceman if you

3012.41 --> 3014.68
say so

3020.22 --> 3026.04
but but that's the crazy thing isn't it

3023.18 --> 3029.7799999999997
with a religion like the ball that has

3026.04 --> 3031.98
that is just mechanically so inept so

3029.78 --> 3036.69
ridiculously suspended within this

3031.98 --> 3039.54
belief so so far so broken so dependent

3036.69 --> 3042.0
on the the will to choose to ignore

3039.54 --> 3045.54
reality in order to believe it it's so

3042.0 --> 3050.49
resting on that that any kind of little

3045.54 --> 3052.95
trinket that'll just like push the dream

3050.49 --> 3055.3799999999997
a little bit more into reality just one

3052.95 --> 3066.8999999999996
siding of oh I see a satellite going

3055.38 --> 3071.04
past a moon that means it's all once and

3066.9 --> 3073.319
that one image convinced me that despite

3071.04 --> 3078.0
everything I've ever learned is totally

3073.319 --> 3081.23
broken that it's still true that's it

3078.0 --> 3081.23
that's the trick

3086.24 --> 3089.37
[Music]

3099.61 --> 3109.7200000000003
it's its feet it's religious mind food

3104.64 --> 3112.39
to help you delude yourself in doubling

3109.72 --> 3114.25
down on what you deep down know is wrong

3112.39 --> 3116.8599999999997
but you can't handle the responsibility

3114.25 --> 3119.55
of allowing yourself to realize it and

3116.86 --> 3119.55
move on

3133.119 --> 3137.3900000000003
now flatter spaceman what I just

3135.619 --> 3140.119
described with the supposed it's at

3137.39 --> 3142.91
lighting from the moon and all that it's

3140.119 --> 3147.579
not a it's not really a Black Swan

3142.91 --> 3150.6499999999996
argument I was just showing that the way

3147.579 --> 3153.5890000000004
ballers and ball believers deal with

3150.65 --> 3158.2400000000002
things is not the way we deal with

3153.589 --> 3162.17
things because they will take any type

3158.24 --> 3164.75
of visual thingy a gadget to emphasize

3162.17 --> 3167.27
the dream and they will use that to

3164.75 --> 3170.089
ignore the facts because that's really

3167.27 --> 3173.18
what what what it does is what how the

3170.089 --> 3175.91
system works yes the main priority is

3173.18 --> 3179.4199999999996
ignore as many facts as you can in order

3175.91 --> 3181.6299999999997
to maintain the machinations and all

3179.42 --> 3184.82
that and the belief that it's real that

3181.63 --> 3191.599
is it that is the mechanism that is the

3184.82 --> 3194.54
entire mechanism psychology and all how

3191.599 --> 3195.71
do we all together keep fooling

3194.54 --> 3201.02
ourselves and each other

3195.71 --> 3203.98
and what we're doing makes sense that's

3201.02 --> 3203.98
the globe religion

3214.79 --> 3217.829
[Music]

3218.25 --> 3223.48
all right so yeah I'm gonna round out

3220.72 --> 3224.7599999999998
the show I I hoped you liked it I

3223.48 --> 3229.69
thought it was pretty good actually

3224.76 --> 3233.05
pretty fluent the very few pauses not

3229.69 --> 3239.29
too long-winded I hope I'll have to

3233.05 --> 3241.1200000000003
listen back to this one anyway do I need

3239.29 --> 3248.44
to go through something else too

3241.12 --> 3248.98
what else did I do no no that was pretty

3248.44 --> 3251.71
much it

3248.98 --> 3255.82
oh yeah also what oh god I mean watching

3251.71 --> 3258.37
it do like an illiberal concept movie

3255.82 --> 3262.48
and it is terrifying in a way but it's

3258.37 --> 3267.88
also fascinating there's a Netflix God

3262.48 --> 3271.27
movie called downsizing and it is so it

3267.88 --> 3273.48
is so typical it's like an aberration

3271.27 --> 3276.16
it's a cultural aberration it's like I

3273.48 --> 3278.5
don't know it I thought it was a as a

3276.16 --> 3284.31
concept movie it's quite fascinating and

3278.5 --> 3287.5
terrifying because there is so much

3284.31 --> 3289.93
consequential natural behavior things

3287.5 --> 3292.69
ways of thinking being actively ignored

3289.93 --> 3295.5699999999997
in this movie and that seems to be the

3292.69 --> 3298.39
real thing about the movie is that it is

3295.57 --> 3301.78
there's something really wrong about it

3298.39 --> 3303.8799999999997
but it is also fascinating and I haven't

3301.78 --> 3309.19
watched finish it finished watching it

3303.88 --> 3313.84
yet but I was pretty astounded by how

3309.19 --> 3317.86
far they took the concept serious so

3313.84 --> 3321.67
yeah it's it's an interesting science

3317.86 --> 3323.6200000000003
fiction concept movie and I'm definitely

3321.67 --> 3325.4500000000003
gonna finish watching it so yeah it's

3323.62 --> 3329.98
called downsizing on Netflix

3325.45 --> 3331.68
it is super Hollywood liberal but yeah

3329.98 --> 3336.76
it's not like you're constantly being

3331.68 --> 3339.6299999999997
it's not sjw well in a way it is I think

3336.76 --> 3343.48
it's more environmentalism type of

3339.63 --> 3345.46
liberal angle aimed and all that I don't

3343.48 --> 3346.43
know it's just you got to see it to

3345.46 --> 3351.38
understand what

3346.43 --> 3353.569
mean it's but it yeah anyway I've seen

3351.38 --> 3357.559
it or a part of it I'm gonna finish

3353.569 --> 3359.39
watching it eventually and yeah maybe

3357.559 --> 3360.829
we'll talk about that later but anyway I

3359.39 --> 3363.47
am definitely gonna round out the show

3360.829 --> 3366.079
