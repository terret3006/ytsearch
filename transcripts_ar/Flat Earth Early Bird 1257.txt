194.8 --> 198.519
i feel pretty good

198.64 --> 202.07999999999998
yeah so yesterday

205.69 --> 208.96
[Music]

209.28 --> 213.599
yeah

210.64 --> 215.599
right flat earth debates

213.599 --> 217.2
it was pretty good i thought that my

215.599 --> 221.35999999999999
show was pretty good

217.2 --> 221.35999999999999
however short it was but it was just uh

221.44 --> 226.72
yeah nothing like the day before when

223.36 --> 228.08
everything was just super bogged down

226.72 --> 230.799
but

228.08 --> 233.04000000000002
it was a good early bird show

230.799 --> 235.59900000000002
and flat earth debate was also

233.04 --> 235.599
pretty good

237.04 --> 241.0
no ballers or anything

242.879 --> 246.72
right the after show

244.72 --> 249.68
was not super long but at least it

246.72 --> 251.76
wasn't like only 50 minutes

249.68 --> 253.28
and yeah later that evening

251.76 --> 254.879
don't know who you

253.28 --> 258.079
caught on to that

254.879 --> 261.759
i went on to jim bob's again

258.079 --> 263.68
and that was great i literally just

261.759 --> 266.08000000000004
finished watching it back

263.68 --> 269.04
and it was really good

266.08 --> 271.12
very happy about well just the

269.04 --> 272.47900000000004
conversation and my performance and it

271.12 --> 275.68
was like

272.479 --> 278.96
almost stoic even though to be fair i

275.68 --> 278.96
was just like really

279.199 --> 284.40000000000003
very enthusiastic but i was constantly

282.0 --> 286.639
trying to contain myself not to just get

284.4 --> 288.96
super rompassy

286.639 --> 292.08
and besides i was a bit slowed down

288.96 --> 295.19899999999996
anyway it was an evening

292.08 --> 296.88
sun was going down visibly

295.199 --> 299.52000000000004
when i called in it was still kind of

296.88 --> 301.199
light and then like at the end

299.52 --> 303.52
it was dark

301.199 --> 304.639
that usually kind of does slow me down a

303.52 --> 306.479
bit

304.639 --> 308.88
and that was helpful but it was a great

306.479 --> 313.039
conversation very deep very fractal

308.88 --> 314.8
thinking and like jim bob and me is like

313.039 --> 316.56
when we have conversations like that it

314.8 --> 317.6
really feels like he's my brother or

316.56 --> 319.68
something

317.6 --> 322.56
it's epic i love it

319.68 --> 322.56
love to have more of

322.84 --> 328.88
that am i still on d live nope

326.72 --> 332.759
i mean the account's still there i just

328.88 --> 332.759
use it as kind of a backup

338.639 --> 345.039
right but hey even in my d life

343.199 --> 346.40000000000003
the standard description box for the

345.039 --> 350.24
standard page

346.4 --> 351.919
links directly to my youtube show so

350.24 --> 354.24
people should be able to find their way

351.919 --> 354.24
here

356.479 --> 360.31899999999996
what is the channel

358.4 --> 364.44
okay

360.319 --> 364.44
it's our win the wizard bear

368.24 --> 372.479
but again i'm not live streaming there

370.08 --> 372.479
right now

377.6 --> 381.47900000000004
the life came in clearer

384.0 --> 386.479
i get it

387.68 --> 393.68
right the only downside is dlive doesn't

390.24 --> 395.6
actually save your videos unless you pay

393.68 --> 396.8
them

395.6 --> 400.8
so

396.8 --> 402.8
i still have like uh five out of the

400.8 --> 404.08
seven shows i had there i haven't

402.8 --> 407.759
downloaded

404.08 --> 410.479
so i basically got them in my archive

407.759 --> 413.28000000000003
but yeah they're not i i'm not gonna

410.479 --> 414.71999999999997
upload them because then youtube might

413.28 --> 418.52
object

414.72 --> 418.52000000000004
i don't want to risk that

425.199 --> 431.36
but yeah technically if somebody like

428.08 --> 432.71999999999997
wants it to take a look

431.36 --> 437.0
i could

432.72 --> 437.0
just give you the file

441.44 --> 443.84
anyway

444.08 --> 448.84
right so i went on gymbobs yesterday

447.039 --> 452.56
was

448.84 --> 454.71999999999997
great was just yeah

452.56 --> 458.12
still kind of buzzing

454.72 --> 458.12
watching that

478.96 --> 481.96
youtube

492.4 --> 495.9
[Music]

499.919 --> 502.639
right so yeah what have you guys been up

501.599 --> 505.96
to

502.639 --> 505.96000000000004
this friday

512.0 --> 518.959
i missed a couple of streams i think

516.159 --> 522.479
flat side

518.959 --> 522.4789999999999
is doing some live streams

522.8 --> 526.4399999999999
but i missed it

534.08 --> 538.399
uh i got a glimpse of eric today's lake

536.56 --> 541.279
poncho train bridge shows earth

538.399 --> 542.64
curvature video

541.279 --> 544.48
it's kind of

542.64 --> 548.08
a bit old

544.48 --> 550.9590000000001
but still like yeah that's

548.08 --> 553.6
like that's really relevant

550.959 --> 555.5999999999999
five years ago

553.6 --> 558.399
and it's still good to be reminded about

555.6 --> 560.64
that so

558.399 --> 564.48
uh

560.64 --> 566.88
it wasn't like perfectly updated but

564.48 --> 570.6800000000001
what can you do

566.88 --> 570.68
it was good enough

592.24 --> 596.5600000000001
it's nice not seeing you harassed in

594.399 --> 599.12
chat

596.56 --> 599.1199999999999
what do you mean

603.279 --> 608.0
oh right

604.8 --> 610.24
oh haha you think that no no i the

608.0 --> 615.04
trolls got on d life

610.24 --> 615.04
dude they got in there too i was just

616.32 --> 620.1600000000001
look the whole

617.519 --> 622.32
strike thing right

620.16 --> 622.3199999999999
the

625.12 --> 628.24
the original trigger was kind of

626.959 --> 630.0
pointless

628.24 --> 631.279
like seriously but

630.0 --> 632.48
i was

631.279 --> 635.36
like really

632.48 --> 637.76
just starting to like overcook myself

635.36 --> 640.0790000000001
with rage and [ __ ] i mean come on guys

637.76 --> 641.92
you were noticing that

640.079 --> 643.92
so i just took it

641.92 --> 646.7199999999999
for

643.92 --> 650.079
to really focus on like okay

646.72 --> 650.0790000000001
i need to contain this and

650.959 --> 653.5999999999999
like stop

653.76 --> 656.64
giving into that

658.079 --> 663.12
so i just like the trolls that did come

660.16 --> 665.519
in i banned them very quickly

663.12 --> 667.92
so and then you don't get to see

665.519 --> 667.92
at all

668.399 --> 672.72
but yeah there were still trolls there

670.56 --> 674.399
they do come there they really do follow

672.72 --> 676.0790000000001
you around

674.399 --> 678.8
right

676.079 --> 681.8
i think it's their job to harass you

678.8 --> 681.8
so

700.0 --> 710.769
seth willenberg

702.09 --> 710.769
[Music]

736.399 --> 740.079
right

737.68 --> 741.76
anybody else get a chance to watch

740.079 --> 744.88
blueberry

741.76 --> 747.04
did everybody already give up

744.88 --> 749.68
but you couldn't find a proper

747.04 --> 749.68
subtitle

751.2 --> 756.44
or you secretly watched it without it

753.44 --> 756.44
anyway

773.12 --> 777.92
i mean yeah that movie is still on my

774.959 --> 780.8
mind especially some of the music like i

777.92 --> 783.36
don't know if any of you have ever like

780.8 --> 784.8389999999999
come across the dvd like the dvd that i

783.36 --> 786.639

821.279 --> 825.399

[Music]

1012.16 --> 1014.88
the music

1018.399 --> 1022.079
like especially the beginning it's

1020.079 --> 1025.839
almost like you're just going through a

1022.079 --> 1025.839
ride in a theme park

1027.679 --> 1033.2800000000002

has basically zero padding

1049.679 --> 1054.799
except for showing you beautiful

1051.44 --> 1059.4
landscape which is absolutely not

1054.799 --> 1059.4
a terrible thing to be patted with

1070.86 --> 1074.8799999999999
[Music]

1075.76 --> 1081.6
it watches like a dream not very

1077.6 --> 1083.9189999999999

don't worry about it

1124.559 --> 1127.28
no harm done

1131.919 --> 1137.44
film noir america

1134.24 --> 1139.52
perfect yeah that that is what it is it

1137.44 --> 1143.1200000000001
is

1139.52 --> 1144.72
a european movie about a romanticized

1143.12 --> 1147.28
america

1144.72 --> 1147.28
basically

1148.32 --> 1153.84
but still very honest

1150.96 --> 1156.16
like it not propaganda it is so

1153.84 --> 1159.12
politically perfect

1156.16 --> 1162.3200000000002
it is so just

1159.12 --> 1165.039
no pretense no like oh we want you to go

1162.32 --> 1168.96
and feel like this about it right

1165.039 --> 1171.679
nothing political about it's completely

1168.96 --> 1174.08
void of political influence and that is

1171.679 --> 1177.0800000000002
remarkable really when you think about

1174.08 --> 1177.08
it

1179.52 --> 1185.679
now i'm not going to be bear with

1183.039 --> 1185.679
matthew hall

1189.52 --> 1195.039
oh god unless owen benjamin insists that

1192.799 --> 1198.72
i be called berwin because he doesn't

1195.039 --> 1201.36
want a wizard bear which i understand

1198.72 --> 1204.559
he's highly suspicious of wizards and i

1201.36 --> 1207.559
am kind of an open wizard

1204.559 --> 1207.559
diviner

1213.44 --> 1218.159
but yeah

1214.64 --> 1221.2
i mean he's a bard i'm a wizard

1218.159 --> 1223.6000000000001
i'm on his side i hope he takes note

1221.2 --> 1226.159
yeah we would have to but if he's going

1223.6 --> 1229.039
to be suspicious that is i kind of like

1226.159 --> 1230.0800000000002
that i guess maybe i do also have a bit

1229.039 --> 1234.919
of

1230.08 --> 1234.9189999999999
rabbler in me just like he does

1238.24 --> 1243.36
and i like everybody just being sharp

1241.44 --> 1246.0
that's what i like most because if

1243.36 --> 1248.0
everybody else is sharp then i am sharp

1246.0 --> 1250.32
then suddenly

1248.0 --> 1254.6
there's an opportunity for the ability

1250.32 --> 1254.6
to actually start manifesting

1257.27 --> 1260.3799999999999
[Music]

1268.24 --> 1271.799
hey psych bear

1280.14 --> 1283.3090000000002
[Music]

1287.24 --> 1290.609
[Music]

1292.73 --> 1295.769
[Music]

1298.32 --> 1302.24
oh by the way

1300.08 --> 1305.9189999999999
for those that

1302.24 --> 1308.88
are a bit nerdy and like d and d

1305.919 --> 1311.2800000000002
when i say things like diviner

1308.88 --> 1315.2800000000002
and all that

1311.28 --> 1316.84
there there are like deeper fractal

1315.28 --> 1320.3999999999999
context to that

1316.84 --> 1323.039
actually because there is this thing in

1320.4 --> 1325.2800000000002
in dnd it is kind of contemporary

1323.039 --> 1327.44
because they've rearranged dungeons and

1325.28 --> 1330.08
dragons so much

1327.44 --> 1331.6000000000001
the four and the five and six whatever

1330.08 --> 1332.48
is out there now i don't even know

1331.6 --> 1334.32
anymore

1332.48 --> 1336.799
they rearranged everything so much that

1334.32 --> 1340.0
the original design

1336.799 --> 1342.4
from the three series which is

1340.0 --> 1345.039
the most elaborate one and it is the one

1342.4 --> 1349.44
that i based my works on

1345.039 --> 1352.08
like there's this thing about wizard

1349.44 --> 1354.72
spell schools

1352.08 --> 1357.1999999999998
you can be a specialist then you get

1354.72 --> 1358.48
like extra

1357.2 --> 1362.0800000000002
room

1358.48 --> 1364.48
to cast more specific spells right well

1362.08 --> 1367.28
there is a system in that because every

1364.48 --> 1371.1200000000001
class has like natural opposition class

1367.28 --> 1373.6789999999999
that you are prohibited to use

1371.12 --> 1375.4399999999998
right it's a thing

1373.679 --> 1377.039
and i think that there is something

1375.44 --> 1378.3200000000002
deeper

1377.039 --> 1380.96
behind

1378.32 --> 1383.52
that arrangement

1380.96 --> 1385.2
has to do with like focus of frequency

1383.52 --> 1388.08
within

1385.2 --> 1390.0
the higher insight wizardry right so i'm

1388.08 --> 1393.6789999999999
a definer

1390.0 --> 1396.64
the the prohibited school for a diviner

1393.679 --> 1396.64
is illusion

1397.679 --> 1403.039
why because it is exactly the opposite

1400.24 --> 1404.88
diviner is somebody who figures out the

1403.039 --> 1406.8799999999999
truth about things

1404.88 --> 1408.0800000000002
information gathering

1406.88 --> 1412.5590000000002
magically

1408.08 --> 1413.9189999999999
looking through time communing with

1412.559 --> 1417.32
events

1413.919 --> 1417.3200000000002
yeah it's whatever

1417.679 --> 1422.3200000000002
illusion is literally influencing yeah

1421.039 --> 1426.72
creating

1422.32 --> 1430.08
reality mind influencing alterations

1426.72 --> 1432.96
illusion it is quite straightforward so

1430.08 --> 1435.76
when i say diviner i am basically

1432.96 --> 1437.679
telling people who understand wizardry

1435.76 --> 1439.919
from a dungeons and dragons perspective

1437.679 --> 1444.88
which i think has

1439.919 --> 1447.44
actual roots in how it works in reality

1444.88 --> 1449.919
not literally like in the game but

1447.44 --> 1452.72
the spell school system

1449.919 --> 1454.7990000000002
basically saying i i don't i'm about

1452.72 --> 1457.2
truth

1454.799 --> 1458.48
i don't create illusions for people to

1457.2 --> 1459.679
dwell upon

1458.48 --> 1463.039
i don't

1459.679 --> 1466.5590000000002
like everything about me opposes that

1463.039 --> 1469.6
and i naturally break

1466.559 --> 1470.96
illusions i have to

1469.6 --> 1474.32
or

1470.96 --> 1476.96
i play with them i basically

1474.32 --> 1478.799
de-weaponize them by revealing the truth

1476.96 --> 1482.799
about them and then

1478.799 --> 1485.6
if there is sufficient room for it

1482.799 --> 1486.799
that it can still be used like a virtual

1485.6 --> 1489.6
toy

1486.799 --> 1491.679
a fictional playground for example like

1489.6 --> 1492.559
with the globe

1491.679 --> 1495.8400000000001
right

1492.559 --> 1498.799
but only after it has been disarmed

1495.84 --> 1498.799
through the truth

1499.279 --> 1504.24
huh anyway i'm getting a bit esoteric

1502.159 --> 1506.3200000000002
here

1504.24 --> 1508.0
uh

1506.32 --> 1511.9189999999999
where again a new

1508.0 --> 1515.12
no i'm not what oh my god

1511.919 --> 1516.24
why people do that

1515.12 --> 1519.12
i mean

1516.24 --> 1520.159
i've literally been wearing this amulet

1519.12 --> 1524.0
for

1520.159 --> 1524.0
pretty much three years straight

1526.24 --> 1529.44
hello

1527.84 --> 1533.559
seth

1529.44 --> 1533.559
are you feeling all right

1542.08 --> 1547.4399999999998
maybe uh blueberry kind of influenced

1544.96 --> 1550.32
you in a uh in a way that you actually

1547.44 --> 1550.3200000000002
didn't want it to

1550.72 --> 1554.919
you seem a bit distorted

1557.76 --> 1562.64
what silver looks good no

1560.4 --> 1564.96
it's silver it's called a reflection

1562.64 --> 1569.44
it's reflecting

1564.96 --> 1570.559
the wood here see that's the color

1569.44 --> 1573.1200000000001
of

1570.559 --> 1573.12
the wood

1583.12 --> 1588.84
i can assure you this is quite pure

1585.84 --> 1588.84
silver

1592.76 --> 1596.309
[Music]

1607.14 --> 1610.199
[Music]

1621.36 --> 1624.799
remember that one go over

1625.2 --> 1629.72
what just one or two

1650.64 --> 1657.5590000000002
how are you chanting in my chat seth

1653.12 --> 1657.559
wildenberg in dutch no less

1686.799 --> 1695.24
but they destroyed their culture oh god

1691.2 --> 1695.24
okay pj c net

1696.159 --> 1698.72
think

1697.36 --> 1700.24
almost

1698.72 --> 1703.76
almost right

1700.24 --> 1706.96
i believe camera freeze no is it

1703.76 --> 1706.96
oh yeah you're right

1708.08 --> 1711.52
thanks seeking star water

1712.32 --> 1714.559
look

1714.96 --> 1719.8400000000001
they didn't

1716.96 --> 1723.08
destroy

1719.84 --> 1723.08
that culture

1724.08 --> 1727.36
the indians gave it up

1727.52 --> 1730.1589999999999
they couldn't

1731.52 --> 1736.559
like continue

1733.919 --> 1736.5590000000002
the focus

1737.52 --> 1743.44
and i mean there might still be some out

1740.08 --> 1746.1589999999999
there and they will be like really

1743.44 --> 1747.44
really isolated to think that i'm like a

1746.159 --> 1749.5200000000002
hermit

1747.44 --> 1751.279
no

1749.52 --> 1752.8799999999999
there's some real

1751.279 --> 1754.96
like

1752.88 --> 1756.72
old style

1754.96 --> 1760.159
native american shamans they're going to

1756.72 --> 1761.679
be like really isolated

1760.159 --> 1764.3200000000002
like

1761.679 --> 1768.159
hope hoping that nobody will ever find

1764.32 --> 1769.84
out they even exist kind of isolated

1768.159 --> 1771.7600000000002
all right

1769.84 --> 1774.08
because this world is just

1771.76 --> 1776.1589999999999
it's much worse now than it was even

1774.08 --> 1778.72
then

1776.159 --> 1780.7990000000002
so much psychological warfare so much

1778.72 --> 1783.6000000000001
nining and

1780.799 --> 1785.52
just imping around

1783.6 --> 1786.7199999999998
like

1785.52 --> 1789.2
that

1786.72 --> 1792.96
how can you maintain

1789.2 --> 1795.919
such deep pure spirit and freedom

1792.96 --> 1798.0
in the face of that see

1795.919 --> 1800.159
that's what i think

1798.0 --> 1802.32
right you can't just say oh

1800.159 --> 1806.3990000000001
the bad man came

1802.32 --> 1806.399
and they destroyed it all no

1806.84 --> 1813.12
because you can't really destroy that

1812.08 --> 1817.6399999999999
you see

1813.12 --> 1817.6399999999999
it can only be given up

1824.399 --> 1830.0
it's like when the in the moment like

1827.679 --> 1832.0
you can't handle the sacrifices that you

1830.0 --> 1835.2
see are

1832.0 --> 1838.08
required to keep doing it

1835.2 --> 1838.0800000000002
and then you give up

1841.44 --> 1845.1200000000001
and then of course they were being

1843.12 --> 1847.279
pushed from outside it was just war and

1845.12 --> 1849.52
they were religious war

1847.279 --> 1850.88
in between that all

1849.52 --> 1854.08
yeah

1850.88 --> 1854.0800000000002
pressure was enormous

1863.679 --> 1867.6000000000001
you happy you seen it okay

1873.36 --> 1878.1589999999999
all right

1875.039 --> 1879.75
but i think in ways

1878.159 --> 1881.1200000000001
right all that [ __ ]

1879.75 --> 1884.48
[Music]

1881.12 --> 1886.2399999999998
re-education and like horrible things

1884.48 --> 1888.64
that they've done with native american

1886.24 --> 1888.64
children

1888.96 --> 1894.3990000000001
that probably couldn't have happened

1892.48 --> 1896.32
if

1894.399 --> 1898.8799999999999
they hadn't given up

1896.32 --> 1901.4399999999998
on that spirit if they hadn't

1898.88 --> 1904.0800000000002
just like okay we're gonna adapt to this

1901.44 --> 1906.3200000000002
new society now

1904.08 --> 1907.9189999999999
even to a minor degree they hadn't done

1906.32 --> 1909.76
that all that probably wouldn't have

1907.919 --> 1911.279
happened but

1909.76 --> 1912.8799999999999
they could have risked just complete

1911.279 --> 1915.36
wipeout as well

1912.88 --> 1915.3600000000001
right it's

1917.279 --> 1920.76
i'm just saying

1920.88 --> 1925.7600000000002
you can't just like all just say oh it's

1923.919 --> 1928.24
the bad man that came

1925.76 --> 1930.72
that did all the bad no

1928.24 --> 1932.96
because such power such connection you

1930.72 --> 1935.84
can't that can't be destroyed it can

1932.96 --> 1935.8400000000001
only be given up

1940.799 --> 1944.24
exactly

1943.279 --> 1946.799
right

1944.24 --> 1948.48
because if you don't realize that then

1946.799 --> 1951.2
you're gonna have an imbalance and

1948.48 --> 1953.679
you're suddenly gonna dehumanize

1951.2 --> 1953.679
a group

1955.519 --> 1962.08
and i mean like even like in the movie

1958.64 --> 1963.6000000000001
blueberry you can the people there right

1962.08 --> 1964.72
they're not

1963.6 --> 1967.36
evil

1964.72 --> 1969.2
most of them

1967.36 --> 1971.12
the vast majority they're not evil

1969.2 --> 1974.0
they're just kind of like stuck up in

1971.12 --> 1975.1999999999998
their own little thing and

1974.0 --> 1977.279
like

1975.2 --> 1980.159
kind of dwelling

1977.279 --> 1980.159
they're not evil

1980.559 --> 1984.32
like they don't really know what they're

1982.0 --> 1984.32
doing

1988.64 --> 1993.1200000000001
and like even the old man from the ranch

1991.12 --> 1995.279
and all that

1993.12 --> 1997.6789999999999
like a businessman guy he like that

1995.279 --> 1999.76
guy's not evil you he was really like

1997.679 --> 2001.8400000000001
trying to just express like a man that

1999.76 --> 2004.799
has a lot of responsibility and has has

2001.84 --> 2007.36
to deal with all these fools right it

2004.799 --> 2008.72
was everything about the whole movie was

2007.36 --> 2010.4799999999998
good and

2008.72 --> 2012.96
realistic

2010.48 --> 2015.1200000000001
even though the conversations were like

2012.96 --> 2017.519
kind of basic

2015.12 --> 2018.9599999999998
everybody's attitude

2017.519 --> 2020.88
was like

2018.96 --> 2022.96
it meant something

2020.88 --> 2025.2
they were all really trying to character

2022.96 --> 2025.2
act

2027.84 --> 2030.1589999999999
right

2030.559 --> 2035.6
so it is really about in my opinion it

2033.679 --> 2038.88
is about like

2035.6 --> 2041.12
the spiritual path and the conflict and

2038.88 --> 2043.0390000000002
how that changes you and

2041.12 --> 2046.08
holding back and then

2043.039 --> 2048.64
being confronted

2046.08 --> 2048.64
facing

2049.679 --> 2053.679
the evil that plagued you like

2054.159 --> 2059.28
and it's not about oh these are the

2056.72 --> 2061.4399999999996
batman that destroyed it all don't feel

2059.28 --> 2064.0
like that

2061.44 --> 2066.7200000000003
you almost take away the power

2064.0 --> 2068.24
of what they show you and the mysticism

2066.72 --> 2070.56
also behind that

2068.24 --> 2073.1189999999997
you take away its power

2070.56 --> 2075.7599999999998
by believing that

2073.119 --> 2078.159
batman stupid man came in and just

2075.76 --> 2078.96
destroyed it

2078.159 --> 2081.52
you

2078.96 --> 2085.119
take away its power in your mind you

2081.52 --> 2088.7599999999998
disrespect it and therefore not truly

2085.119 --> 2088.76
understand it

2098.72 --> 2103.16
we do have to deal with it though

2100.16 --> 2103.16
correct

2121.28 --> 2124.0
right

2122.4 --> 2126.2400000000002
well what i'm saying

2124.0 --> 2129.48
loosely promising

2126.24 --> 2129.4799999999996
that potentially

2130.32 --> 2138.32
this could be regained this power

2134.24 --> 2143.16
that the old native americans had

2138.32 --> 2143.1600000000003
they could potentially regain it

2144.72 --> 2150.48
it's just dormant now and the way that

2148.0 --> 2153.359
would unfold is they would have to go

2150.48 --> 2155.119
through all the societal challenges now

2153.359 --> 2156.72
it will be a lot more difficult to

2155.119 --> 2159.2000000000003
actually attain it because you have to

2156.72 --> 2161.68
like let everything go

2159.2 --> 2163.1189999999997
all the mechanics all the the details of

2161.68 --> 2166.0789999999997
going about

2163.119 --> 2168.56
even understanding people in a way

2166.079 --> 2170.0
because you're focused on that behavior

2168.56 --> 2172.72
it becomes

2170.0 --> 2175.359
even in my new part of you and that is

2172.72 --> 2176.3999999999996
disruptive it presets the way you're

2175.359 --> 2180.0789999999997

2176.4 --> 2182.56
when you're doing a deep journey

2180.079 --> 2183.8390000000004
hope some of you understand this

2182.56 --> 2186.0
so

2183.839 --> 2188.24
it could be regained it's just so much

2186.0 --> 2190.72
more difficult right effectively it is

2188.24 --> 2193.839
sort of what i'm trying to do

2190.72 --> 2195.68
and i'm almost crazy

2193.839 --> 2197.839
because of it

2195.68 --> 2200.839
arguably some people just think i'm

2197.839 --> 2200.839
crazy

2216.56 --> 2219.2799999999997
kill your television well that's a good

2218.32 --> 2221.52
step

2219.28 --> 2224.32
definitely it's not the end of it though

2221.52 --> 2226.72
it's it's like a first step really

2224.32 --> 2230.32
seeking star wars television

2226.72 --> 2230.3199999999997
it's an important step though

2233.359 --> 2236.72
to be subjected to

2237.119 --> 2243.839
uninvolved programming

2239.68 --> 2243.839
just sitting there and watching stuff

off you're still gonna have to face

2291.52 --> 2296.079
people that haven't

2294.079 --> 2299.079
you're gonna indirectly deal with the

2296.079 --> 2299.079

2305.28 --> 2310.96
and they some will even try to lure you

2308.48 --> 2314.2400000000002
back in like oh you gotta watch this you

2310.96 --> 2314.2400000000002
gotta watch this right

aren't we

2460.88 --> 2466.76
is it literally not allowed to like

yeah maybe i don't think canada really

2496.4 --> 2502.2400000000002
is involved with that

i don't know

2505.839 --> 2509.48
absolutely forbidden

2512.24 --> 2517.2
that's the message i'm getting or what

2515.04 --> 2519.839
is the message exactly and who are you

2517.2 --> 2519.839
getting it from

2520.24 --> 2527.2

2522.96 --> 2527.2
lot of people spreading rumors

people say all kinds of things

2535.839 --> 2540.7999999999997

2538.079 --> 2544.079
at some point backed with

2540.8 --> 2547.52
actual data and references then

2544.079 --> 2549.599
you just gotta concede it's a rumor

2547.52 --> 2552.319
it's just there to kind of excite you

2549.599 --> 2554.88
about something

2552.319 --> 2557.119

no entry

that's a pretty big area by the way 500

2574.4 --> 2579.28
miles wow

2576.56 --> 2582.7999999999997
but who

2579.28 --> 2587.2000000000003
like who is doing the forbidding

2582.8 --> 2587.2000000000003
no entry says who says what

2587.839 --> 2591.96
who's making the rule

2599.04 --> 2603.359

2599.92 --> 2604.4
i mean if it's like oh we're not allowed

2603.359 --> 2606.72
there

2604.4 --> 2609.04
it says who says what

2606.72 --> 2611.1189999999997
what's actually

2609.04 --> 2613.68
who's forbidding it right

2611.119 --> 2615.44
what's going on

2613.68 --> 2616.64
it's just like oh we're not a lie there

2615.44 --> 2618.8
it says who

2616.64 --> 2621.68
i mean why would you even assume that

2618.8 --> 2624.319
unless there is like direct

2621.68 --> 2626.8799999999997
statement somewhere in law like no

2624.319 --> 2629.04
we don't allow people to go there like

2626.88 --> 2630.1600000000003
maybe the military or whatever from some

2629.04 --> 2633.8
group

2630.16 --> 2633.7999999999997
how does it work

2645.119 --> 2648.56
it didn't mandel out of existence seth

2647.44 --> 2650.8
willenberg

2648.56 --> 2653.2799999999997
it's just not shown

2650.8 --> 2655.119
on the projection

2653.28 --> 2657.0400000000004
whatever that is

2655.119 --> 2659.04
i don't even know

2657.04 --> 2661.7599999999998
if it was ever there

2659.04 --> 2663.2799999999997
the supposed island

2661.76 --> 2666.079
with the four rivers in the mountain

2663.28 --> 2667.3590000000004
range i don't know it was ever actually

2666.079 --> 2669.119
there

2667.359 --> 2672.48
but i don't

2669.119 --> 2674.8
think it's impossible

2672.48 --> 2677.68
but yeah what happened to it it might

2674.8 --> 2680.319
have sank well let's take a look at the

2677.68 --> 2681.7599999999998
ocean bottom then right

2680.319 --> 2684.0
or

2681.76 --> 2685.0400000000004
yeah maybe it's just really freaking

2684.0 --> 2687.68
weird

2685.04 --> 2690.56
and just like the the layout of the

2687.68 --> 2694.0
available space in the realm changed

2690.56 --> 2694.0
like the loop shifted

2694.079 --> 2698.1600000000003
and it's presupposing a couple of things

2696.079 --> 2700.8
of course

2698.16 --> 2701.68
the looping nature and that that could

2700.8 --> 2704.88
happen

2701.68 --> 2707.1189999999997
and then maybe what was once a big chunk

2704.88 --> 2710.88
of land and an island that was once

2707.119 --> 2713.359
connected suddenly is not connected

2710.88 --> 2714.96
and it just you just move on you you

2713.359 --> 2717.119
move through where you would have

2714.96 --> 2718.8
normally bumped into it and just get to

2717.119 --> 2722.1600000000003
the other side like that

2718.8 --> 2725.599
piece of space is no longer connected

2722.16 --> 2727.1189999999997
that could be it who knows what's really

2725.599 --> 2729.119
with that

2727.119 --> 2731.2000000000003
that old map

2729.119 --> 2733.839
chunk of land and the four rivers who

2731.2 --> 2733.839
knows

2737.95 --> 2741.2
[Music]

2754.96 --> 2758.839
all right so maybe

2757.599 --> 2762.319
that

2758.839 --> 2764.319
land is not actually at like a dead

2762.319 --> 2766.319
center point

2764.319 --> 2767.2799999999997
have you ever considered that

2766.319 --> 2769.7599999999998
that

2767.28 --> 2772.5600000000004
the way it's shown is all because of the

2769.76 --> 2774.6400000000003
projection of the map itself

2772.56 --> 2776.88
what if it simply is

2774.64 --> 2781.1189999999997
a chunk of land that is

2776.88 --> 2781.119
well way beyond the north

2781.28 --> 2787.28
because it's not actually the dead point

2784.72 --> 2789.5989999999997
of a circle

2787.28 --> 2791.28
it just lines up like that in the map

2789.599 --> 2794.079
projection

2791.28 --> 2797.0400000000004
and that there is land that actually is

2794.079 --> 2799.2000000000003
beyond that point

2797.04 --> 2801.2
you know

2799.2 --> 2803.5989999999997
just because they show it in the map

2801.2 --> 2806.16
projection like that it might be like

2803.599 --> 2807.839
just a reminder like hey there is this

2806.16 --> 2809.2799999999997
landmass

2807.839 --> 2811.7599999999998
we're just gonna put it in the map to

2809.28 --> 2813.76
remind you but in reality it's like much

2811.76 --> 2814.6400000000003
further away

2813.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
right

2814.64 --> 2817.839
who knows what's behind

2818.0 --> 2823.16
the reason why they put it in those old

2820.16 --> 2823.16

what is your take on dateline what the

2833.2 --> 2838.96
hell is that and how does that relate to

2836.0 --> 2838.96
a looping model

3104.88 --> 3110.1600000000003
it it doesn't match

3107.359 --> 3112.4
on our map projection apparently so i'm

3110.16 --> 3115.3999999999996
asking okay so how about on this map

but at least everything is just more to

3220.4 --> 3223.4
scale

3225.359 --> 3230.0
so in that sense a more close

3228.16 --> 3234.68
approximation

3230.0 --> 3234.68
of the actual euclidean reality

3236.53 --> 3239.5890000000004
[Music]

3248.72 --> 3251.72
hmm

3264.559 --> 3266.88
right

3269.76 --> 3273.599
so here it is

3274.72 --> 3279.3999999999996
should give you vantage point enough

3282.319 --> 3285.319
right

3300.72 --> 3304.0
you know my looping models why you

3302.4 --> 3306.2400000000002
thought the dateline issue would appeal

3304.0 --> 3307.68
to me well i'm not really emotionally

3306.24 --> 3309.7599999999998
invested

3307.68 --> 3312.24
in the rectangular looping thing it's

3309.76 --> 3314.88
just that i kind of think it is it's

3312.24 --> 3317.2
just going to turn out to be like that

3314.88 --> 3318.6400000000003
and why it hasn't just been accepted

3317.2 --> 3320.48
earlier is mostly because of

3318.64 --> 3323.1189999999997
psychological issues physicality

3320.48 --> 3325.92
assumption bias

3323.119 --> 3328.1600000000003
people being spoiled

3325.92 --> 3331.64
in their minds and their

3328.16 --> 3331.64
yeah with heliocentrism

3334.24 --> 3338.64
but i'm not like emotionally invested

3339.44 --> 3343.359
it could definitely turn out to not be

3341.76 --> 3346.3190000000004
like that

3343.359 --> 3349.839
right i'm all open for whatever evidence

3346.319 --> 3349.839
is gonna roll in

3352.559 --> 3356.4
but yeah a lot of the times if there's

3355.04 --> 3358.16
like oh

3356.4 --> 3361.2000000000003
this doesn't match

3358.16 --> 3362.64
in the disk model somewhere right

3361.2 --> 3364.24
there's going to be back and forth about

3362.64 --> 3367.68
that again then i'll be like yeah that's

3364.24 --> 3370.8799999999997
because it's still a projection and

3367.68 --> 3375.319
so very suggestive and all that but it's

3370.88 --> 3375.319
just not really a disk

3383.68 --> 3387.839
and then i yeah resort back to the

3386.319 --> 3391.119
rectangular

3387.839 --> 3391.92
looping model approach

3391.119 --> 3394.319
so

3391.92 --> 3396.4
that's just a basic reaction to me right

3394.319 --> 3398.48
now it's not like oh man i've got all

3396.4 --> 3400.7200000000003
this material prepared in my head for

3398.48 --> 3403.44
when somebody asks me about

3400.72 --> 3406.24
why doesn't it line up

3403.44 --> 3409.04
it's just like yeah because that's not

3406.24 --> 3409.04
correct either

3409.92 --> 3414.799
the information about it is all over the

3412.24 --> 3417.359
place i mean disc

3414.799 --> 3419.44
is still a projection it's not the scale

3417.359 --> 3420.4
it's not the skill that means it's not

3419.44 --> 3422.2400000000002
actual

3420.4 --> 3424.4
over

3422.24 --> 3426.16
so every comparison after that point

3424.4 --> 3427.92
like hey why doesn't this match up yeah

3426.16 --> 3431.319
because it's not actual

3427.92 --> 3431.319
that's why

3432.0 --> 3439.76
rectangular or mobius what

3435.119 --> 3439.76
no not mobius it's all very flat

3440.24 --> 3444.9199999999996
mobius ring is

3441.92 --> 3444.92
concave

3446.24 --> 3452.52
that's earth is not

3449.47 --> 3452.52
[Music]

3455.28 --> 3461.8390000000004
applying the firmament holding in the

3457.52 --> 3461.839
gases also loops yeah of course

3465.2 --> 3468.8799999999997
but

3466.319 --> 3470.799
if you want a dynamic

3468.88 --> 3472.559
range of possibilities within your

3470.799 --> 3475.119
looping design you're not going to have

3472.559 --> 3476.4
a dome you're going to have a flat top

3475.119 --> 3478.6400000000003
or

3476.4 --> 3481.28
if that is a mechanical possibility you

3478.64 --> 3482.8799999999997
wouldn't even need a physical structure

3481.28 --> 3484.96
to do anything

3482.88 --> 3487.52
you would simply have

3484.96 --> 3488.64
a set limit to

3487.52 --> 3490.16
space

3488.64 --> 3493.04
like yeah

3490.16 --> 3495.2799999999997
until here and for no further for

3493.04 --> 3498.0
material to do anything

3495.28 --> 3500.8390000000004
so it wouldn't even be a physical object

3498.0 --> 3504.48
obstructing it would simply be the

3500.839 --> 3507.52
end of space for material to move into

3504.48 --> 3509.52
and it would seem like a hard

3507.52 --> 3510.64
maybe like glass type barrier or

3509.52 --> 3512.88
something

3510.64 --> 3515.7599999999998
but it isn't actually material it's just

3512.88 --> 3517.92
this is where space ends material can't

3515.76 --> 3520.079
go further than this no matter what you

3517.92 --> 3520.079
do

3523.52 --> 3527.7599999999998
that

3524.64 --> 3528.72
seems like a more viable

3527.76 --> 3530.559
option

3528.72 --> 3533.2
for a dynamic

3530.559 --> 3534.48
looping system that could even change

3533.2 --> 3536.96
the way

3534.48 --> 3538.559
space is interconnected

3536.96 --> 3541.28
with landmasses

3538.559 --> 3543.52
being able to suddenly connect up

3541.28 --> 3545.6800000000003
within available space

3543.52 --> 3548.12
or disconnected

3545.68 --> 3551.4089999999997
right anyway

3548.12 --> 3551.409
[Music]

3555.76 --> 3561.3590000000004
mobius is flat what that was like a disc

3561.68 --> 3564.48
or like a ring

3564.64 --> 3570.04
that square circle

3567.04 --> 3570.04
what

3580.48 --> 3584.0
they're talking about something

3581.68 --> 3585.52
mathematical because that makes no sense

3584.0 --> 3588.48
to me

3585.52 --> 3591.799
flat square and circle do not

3588.48 --> 3591.799
fit together

3601.92 --> 3604.88
i should have received the package this

3603.52 --> 3606.88
week

3604.88 --> 3611.48
i'm keeping a lookout seeking star wars

3606.88 --> 3611.48
i haven't received it yet

3614.559 --> 3618.76
i'm really looking forward to that

3633.68 --> 3637.44
quite so long looping fine

3638.16 --> 3644.16
then go find the barrier then

3640.72 --> 3645.4399999999996
yeah because oh it's not looping

3644.16 --> 3648.16
okay then

3645.44 --> 3651.04
go find the barrier because

3648.16 --> 3652.72
it's either looping or barrier there's

3651.04 --> 3654.88
no other options

3652.72 --> 3658.3999999999996
like logically like there is no other

3654.88 --> 3662.319
options that could be thought of

3658.4 --> 3662.319
that it would be logically consistent

3662.48 --> 3664.72
so

3664.799 --> 3670.7599999999998
you know it's not looping okay well show

3667.04 --> 3670.7599999999998
me the barrier then

3683.52 --> 3686.52
hmm

3716.559 --> 3722.48
huge guys would work off each other that

3720.4 --> 3724.64

3767.599 --> 3770.559
who are you talking about

3773.119 --> 3779.7200000000003
just talking in general people here in

3775.44 --> 3779.7200000000003
the chat and me sure

3783.2 --> 3788.0789999999997
what percentage of everything i don't

3785.68 --> 3791.2799999999997
know steamy traveler

3788.079 --> 3792.96
it's not gonna be a lot

3791.28 --> 3795.2000000000003
i mean

3792.96 --> 3797.359
i can quite imagine that if you're at

3795.2 --> 3799.2
the point mentally

3797.359 --> 3801.68
where you can actually completely

3799.2 --> 3803.7599999999998
understand that and still be dynamic

3801.68 --> 3806.0
with it and face the world you're

3803.76 --> 3811.76
probably not going to be

3806.0 --> 3815.359
very forward about the details of it all

3811.76 --> 3817.92
unless yeah you just wanna

3815.359 --> 3819.44
show off constantly with how smart you

3817.92 --> 3823.0
are and then everybody's probably gonna

3819.44 --> 3823.0
think you're an [ __ ]

3824.64 --> 3828.5589999999997
because nobody's really gonna get it or

3826.64 --> 3831.5989999999997
it's gonna give them a headache

3828.559 --> 3833.52
or you're gonna get surrounded by nerds

3831.599 --> 3835.76
whatever

3833.52 --> 3838.559
i don't know how many people ascribe to

3835.76 --> 3840.48
that some may talk about it but there's

3838.559 --> 3842.4
i haven't really come across a lot of

3840.48 --> 3846.0
people or

3842.4 --> 3848.079
any people to be fair that completely

3846.0 --> 3850.88
understand

3848.079 --> 3854.96
the things that i've talked about

3850.88 --> 3856.48
and are able to like merge it

3854.96 --> 3857.92
into a wider

3856.48 --> 3860.64
concept

3857.92 --> 3860.64
like i have

3865.359 --> 3870.2799999999997
deeply in the closet oh dear

3881.359 --> 3884.359
hmm

3887.82 --> 3890.8790000000004
[Music]

3926.96 --> 3931.06
right so

3927.99 --> 3931.06
[Music]

3934.079 --> 3939.76
i think though that in the overall fp

3936.72 --> 3940.72
community i think that the vast majority

3939.76 --> 3942.7200000000003
is

3940.72 --> 3944.3999999999996
has settled

3942.72 --> 3946.5589999999997
with the celestial lights being

3944.4 --> 3948.7200000000003
intangible

3946.559 --> 3950.7200000000003
i think most of them have

3948.72 --> 3953.839
kind of like

3950.72 --> 3955.9199999999996
allow that to sink in that part

3953.839 --> 3958.88
but like holographic

3955.92 --> 3961.44
not actual in actual positions that is

3958.88 --> 3963.6800000000003
just physicality assumption bias is

3961.44 --> 3965.2000000000003
really rough on you

3963.68 --> 3967.44
because it literally gives you a

3965.2 --> 3968.24
headache

3967.44 --> 3969.44
right

3968.24 --> 3972.5589999999997
so to

3969.44 --> 3975.039
realize the full holographic potential

3972.559 --> 3977.76
like like non-local holographic that's

3975.039 --> 3979.2000000000003
just very

3977.76 --> 3981.599
bending

3979.2 --> 3982.96
to a lot of people it'll give them a

3981.599 --> 3984.96
headache

3982.96 --> 3987.44
but yeah i think that probably the

3984.96 --> 3989.44
majority by now of the flat earthers

3987.44 --> 3991.44
even if the diskers

3989.44 --> 3994.0
they do know that at least they're

3991.44 --> 3996.16
intangible things they're not

3994.0 --> 3997.2
like a burning

3996.16 --> 3999.68
light

3997.2 --> 4001.9199999999996
that is physically in any position more

3999.68 --> 4003.9199999999996
like a lo they probably believe their

4001.92 --> 4007.839
local holograms

4003.92 --> 4007.839
sort of something like that

4008.48 --> 4011.28
or maybe they just haven't really

4010.079 --> 4013.44
thought

4011.28 --> 4017.2400000000002
with enough detail about it to come to a

4013.44 --> 4017.2400000000002
conclusion like that

4040.0 --> 4043.0
hmm

4053.599 --> 4059.079
all right any more

4056.079 --> 4059.079
questions

4074.319 --> 4079.2799999999997
right oh yeah no bow busters this

4076.4 --> 4079.28
evening by the way

4080.079 --> 4086.119
still doing a

4081.52 --> 4086.119
every two week schedule for that

4093.28 --> 4099.359
humans don't like intangible things by

4095.68 --> 4102.48
nature yeah that's right

4099.359 --> 4102.4800000000005
there is 106.

4103.04 --> 4107.44
so intangible things are already kind of

4105.44 --> 4110.879999999999
confusing right

4107.44 --> 4113.5199999999995
but well how about intangible

4110.88 --> 4115.12
non-local things

4113.52 --> 4118.56
right

4115.12 --> 4120.4
now that part is like really

4118.56 --> 4124.2390000000005
frustrating

4120.4 --> 4124.239
if you've taken that one step further

4126.799 --> 4131.12
yes timmy trevor already said i i'm

4128.96 --> 4133.279
probably if if i get it

4131.12 --> 4136.159
then i will do like a show with seeking

4133.279 --> 4136.159000000001
style water live

4141.759 --> 4145.48
and do a little review

4173.839 --> 4175.92
you

4200.64 --> 4205.92
you didn't know i was into divination

4204.239 --> 4210.5599999999995
no

4205.92 --> 4210.56
i'm not into divination like that

4215.76 --> 4221.1990000000005
i don't need

4218.8 --> 4223.92
like tools

4221.199 --> 4223.919999999999
to divine

4225.199 --> 4231.08
i don't need that

4227.199 --> 4231.08
i divine people

4245.44 --> 4251.0
be noble what are you talking about

4263.679 --> 4270.28
yeah well said roofs and hubbands

4266.159 --> 4270.28
it is very tough

4272.159 --> 4277.5199999999995
interesting that you shared that

4274.239 --> 4280.159
integral internal working

4277.52 --> 4280.159000000001
of you there

4280.32 --> 4282.719
right

4281.52 --> 4284.96
i mean

4282.719 --> 4288.719
for me in the beginning it was like when

4284.96 --> 4291.52
i discovered physicality assumption bias

4288.719 --> 4293.04
it was like discovering like

4291.52 --> 4295.679
i figured something out that's gonna

4293.04 --> 4297.199
make everybody hate me

4295.679 --> 4300.719
okay

4297.199 --> 4302.719
that's what it was really like

4300.719 --> 4305.36
and like the first

4302.719 --> 4307.92
year i i tried to bring it up everybody

4305.36 --> 4307.92
was just like

4311.44 --> 4315.759999999999
so but yeah

4313.36 --> 4318.639999999999
by now it's kind of settled and i think

4315.76 --> 4320.4800000000005
that people are starting to take notice

4318.64 --> 4323.04
of it as a

4320.48 --> 4327.3099999999995
pretty widespread effect that applies to

4323.04 --> 4330.489
a whole bunch of things in your life

4359.84 --> 4362.32
argument

4366.08 --> 4369.36
i'm not even following

4369.679 --> 4372.96
what's being discussed here

4376.56 --> 4383.400000000001
how many years ago did i discover

4379.04 --> 4383.4
during the flat earth debates uh

4385.76 --> 4389.64
early

4387.199 --> 4393.678999999999
i think like

4389.64 --> 4393.679
2017 or something

4395.28 --> 4398.28
like

4398.64 --> 4403.679
like somewhere in the first few hundred

4400.8 --> 4403.679
flat earth debate

4405.28 --> 4411.44
so very early i discovered it

4408.8 --> 4414.159000000001
like way before

4411.44 --> 4416.5599999999995
it was kind of during the isle of man

4414.159 --> 4418.799999999999
period maybe even slightly preceding

4416.56 --> 4420.88
that but that was the time when i was

4418.8 --> 4423.6
starting to like

4420.88 --> 4427.84
make it in like announce it and

4423.6 --> 4427.84
try to explain about it more and more

4427.92 --> 4435.589
so i think it was mostly around 2017

4432.43 --> 4435.589
[Music]

4435.92 --> 4439.32
like jason

4446.48 --> 4452.839999999999
is divination an evil what

4450.96 --> 4457.12
he does seem to think that

4452.84 --> 4457.12
glitch this is really silly

4461.52 --> 4465.360000000001
i mean i hope borders boy also realizes

4464.4 --> 4468.639999999999
that

4465.36 --> 4472.5599999999995
regular playing cards

4468.64 --> 4475.6
can also be used for divination ah

4472.56 --> 4475.6
bet you didn't know that

4476.8 --> 4481.88
so can dice so can bones

4482.56 --> 4485.679
it's all a matter of how you're gonna do

4484.0 --> 4488.56
it

4485.679 --> 4492.5
i mean you can literally do divination

4488.56 --> 4495.689
by looking at the weather huh

4492.5 --> 4495.689
[Music]

4499.04 --> 4502.8
uh-huh pgc net he leaves right did

4501.84 --> 4504.2390000000005
anything

4502.8 --> 4506.400000000001
but

4504.239 --> 4509.36
yeah

4506.4 --> 4511.599999999999
tarot cards for sure but it's all about

4509.36 --> 4513.759999999999
look only thing that matters is what are

4511.6 --> 4517.360000000001
you gonna do with it are you gonna

4513.76 --> 4519.92
obsess and like try to spiritually force

4517.36 --> 4522.639999999999
some kind of end result that you want

4519.92 --> 4525.28
like how much ambition and all that [ __ ]

4522.64 --> 4526.56
are you gonna tie into the actions of

4525.28 --> 4527.36
doing that

4526.56 --> 4529.280000000001
right

4527.36 --> 4531.199
that's where the problem might come in

4529.28 --> 4532.159
that's where the darkness might tempt

4531.199 --> 4533.759999999999
you

4532.159 --> 4537.12
or like

4533.76 --> 4537.12
you basically start

4537.28 --> 4541.36
doing a natural spiritual behavior

4539.92 --> 4543.36
because of it

4541.36 --> 4545.679
it's not

4543.36 --> 4547.5199999999995
the divination cards it's like what are

4545.679 --> 4549.4400000000005
you gonna do with it right what are you

4547.52 --> 4551.280000000001
gonna do with the stick i mean you can

4549.44 --> 4553.759999999999
literally poke somebody's eye out with a

4551.28 --> 4556.32
stick right does that mean that all

4553.76 --> 4558.4800000000005
sticks are evil

4556.32 --> 4558.48
no

4559.28 --> 4563.4
it's the same like with guns

4569.84 --> 4575.2390000000005
i should write a paper about it for

4572.239 --> 4575.239
posterity

4583.92 --> 4587.1990000000005
but i'm not really about writing papers

4585.92 --> 4588.4
though

4587.199 --> 4590.239
dude

4588.4 --> 4592.32
once i get started with that sort of

4590.239 --> 4594.959999999999
[ __ ] like i i would never like come on

4592.32 --> 4594.96
camera again

4596.64 --> 4601.1990000000005
problem is it's very tough for me to get

4598.48 --> 4604.4
going with that

4601.199 --> 4606.719
but i'm kind of trust that if i really

4604.4 --> 4608.5599999999995
somehow managed to get going with like

4606.719 --> 4612.159
writing [ __ ] i probably

4608.56 --> 4612.159000000001
would be unable to stop again

4615.84 --> 4619.04
but i'm just writing

4618.08 --> 4622.88
through

4619.04 --> 4623.6
speaking right it's being recorded

4622.88 --> 4624.96
so

4623.6 --> 4627.6
how is this

4624.96 --> 4630.88
very different from writing except that

4627.6 --> 4633.52
it's happening live and

4630.88 --> 4637.56
it's not edited

4633.52 --> 4637.56
what are my thoughts on necromancy

4637.84 --> 4642.32
depends on what exactly you mean when

4640.159 --> 4645.199
you say that

4642.32 --> 4645.199
is that like in

4646.8 --> 4652.8
in dungeons and dragons magic spell

4649.52 --> 4656.719
school context necromancy

4652.8 --> 4658.4800000000005
or is it in the popular word necromancy

4656.719 --> 4661.84
which could pretty much mean every

4658.48 --> 4665.839999999999
bloody damn thing you can think of

4661.84 --> 4666.8
or are you referring to

4665.84 --> 4669.84
like

4666.8 --> 4669.84
what are you referring to

4673.36 --> 4678.88
i mean

4675.199 --> 4681.839999999999
intention dragons necromancy is like the

4678.88 --> 4684.0
playing with the forces of life so you

4681.84 --> 4686.400000000001
can use it to heal and you can use it to

4684.0 --> 4687.199
take life that's kind of the basics of

4686.4 --> 4689.599999999999
that

4687.199 --> 4690.799999999999
it also by the way includes evil and

4689.6 --> 4693.280000000001
fear

4690.8 --> 4695.679
with it in dungeon in dungeon dragons

4693.28 --> 4699.04
for some reason so it is kind of it does

4695.679 --> 4699.04
have like evil stigma

4700.8 --> 4705.28
but it's very specific it's like healing

4704.08 --> 4707.5199999999995
spells

4705.28 --> 4710.239
like transforming energy into like

4707.52 --> 4713.040000000001
regeneration is also classified as

4710.239 --> 4713.04
necromancy

4714.0 --> 4718.32
so they have like a philosophy behind it

4716.56 --> 4720.320000000001
in there

4718.32 --> 4721.36
but yeah that's dungeons and dragons

4720.32 --> 4723.92
it's

4721.36 --> 4723.92
specific

4728.6 --> 4734.360000000001
communication

4730.239 --> 4734.36
with the dead yeah

4737.52 --> 4742.719
right but communication

4740.08 --> 4743.679
in dungeon dragon terminology

4742.719 --> 4748.0
would

4743.679 --> 4750.719
be more likely to be rooted in

4748.0 --> 4750.719
divination

4754.719 --> 4759.04
but since there are if there is

4757.12 --> 4761.5199999999995
something that is dead or undead

4759.04 --> 4763.12
involved then necromancy does kind of

4761.52 --> 4766.96
come into play but this is all like game

4763.12 --> 4768.88
mechanics and this is not applicable

4766.96 --> 4770.64
literally to everything that's

4768.88 --> 4772.8
supposedly out there that's why i

4770.64 --> 4776.08
specifically said like necromancy is

4772.8 --> 4778.64
just this blown out of proportion

4776.08 --> 4781.04
idea

4778.64 --> 4783.280000000001
that people that are very obsessed with

4781.04 --> 4786.0
evil and dark magic and all that

4783.28 --> 4786.0
supposedly

4787.199 --> 4790.599999999999
like to use

4794.64 --> 4799.64
communicating with the dead in general

4811.679 --> 4814.88
it all depends on what you're going to

4813.199 --> 4817.199
do with it

4814.88 --> 4822.0
i mean is there something personal for

4817.199 --> 4822.0
example you need to put to rest somehow

4822.32 --> 4826.4
okay that

4824.639 --> 4829.12
may be a good

4826.4 --> 4831.36
or interesting to do that

4829.12 --> 4833.44
right it's just that i've never found

4831.36 --> 4835.759999999999
any direct use for communication with

4833.44 --> 4835.759999999999
the dead

4836.639 --> 4841.12
i just

4838.56 --> 4843.84
communicate with spirit

4841.12 --> 4846.48
and that is also

4843.84 --> 4848.88
also includes that but

4846.48 --> 4850.5599999999995
to assume that you can like

4848.88 --> 4853.12
get

4850.56 --> 4855.52
life specifics from

4853.12 --> 4857.28
something that isn't like physically

4855.52 --> 4858.88
interfacing with the physical body

4857.28 --> 4861.36
anymore

4858.88 --> 4864.0
would be to assume that they have those

4861.36 --> 4865.92
memories still available

4864.0 --> 4868.48
after passing

4865.92 --> 4871.04
what's why

4868.48 --> 4873.839999999999
why would you assume that the dead are

4871.04 --> 4876.08
just like humans

4873.84 --> 4876.08
right

4876.8 --> 4881.52
i just don't see the point let the dead

4879.52 --> 4884.400000000001
just

4881.52 --> 4885.6
let them find peace right that's a good

4884.4 --> 4887.44
thing

4885.6 --> 4890.639
restless dead

4887.44 --> 4890.638999999999
are not pleasant

4898.08 --> 4902.5599999999995
i have like

4899.679 --> 4904.88
done some like weird spooky stuff and

4902.56 --> 4908.0
all that in the sense that not conjuring

4904.88 --> 4910.159000000001
spirits absolutely not but like oh

4908.0 --> 4911.76
somebody's saying like oh this house is

4910.159 --> 4913.839999999999
weird and scary

4911.76 --> 4916.96
like oh okay let me see that let's see

4913.84 --> 4918.08
what i can find here and just figure out

4916.96 --> 4919.36
like ah

4918.08 --> 4922.08
okay i'm gonna

4919.36 --> 4924.5599999999995
interface with this place now

4922.08 --> 4926.719
with some internal shields

4924.56 --> 4928.400000000001
and then like oh

4926.719 --> 4930.4800000000005
this happened here

4928.4 --> 4933.679
like 20 years ago or something and

4930.48 --> 4936.5599999999995
nobody ever found out

4933.679 --> 4938.8
and then like oh it makes sense now why

4936.56 --> 4941.84
i'm feeling this it's just like not

4938.8 --> 4945.76
being recognized

4941.84 --> 4948.56
that's what i do it's

4945.76 --> 4950.0
just like why would i like oh let's

4948.56 --> 4953.52
have an

4950.0 --> 4955.92
undead thing or something talk to me

4953.52 --> 4958.96
spell out letters it's like why why

4955.92 --> 4961.52
would you do that you could just

4958.96 --> 4963.84
just connect

4961.52 --> 4963.84
i i

4970.8 --> 4974.56
the only thing you really need to do is

4972.56 --> 4976.320000000001
truly understand and if you truly

4974.56 --> 4978.719
understand something then you will be

4976.32 --> 4980.88
able to communicate with it

4978.719 --> 4982.8
fairly without risk you will be able to

4980.88 --> 4985.8
know things about it without even

4982.8 --> 4985.8
communicating

4986.96 --> 4989.36
anyway

4995.6 --> 4999.6
do you with spirits perceive it yeah

4997.52 --> 5002.2390000000005
well isn't this doesn't the same count

4999.6 --> 5004.2390000000005
if you deal with humans

5002.239 --> 5008.239
proceed with caution

5004.239 --> 5008.239
huh how is that any different

5009.28 --> 5015.5199999999995
if you're dealing with a

5011.44 --> 5017.12
sentient or formerly sentient thing

5015.52 --> 5019.52
you deal with an animal you gotta be

5017.12 --> 5022.48
careful right if you deal with anything

5019.52 --> 5024.639
that is sentient it can feel and respond

5022.48 --> 5028.159
you gotta be careful

5024.639 --> 5030.71
it's not exclusive to spirits

5028.159 --> 5033.829
or ghosts

5030.71 --> 5033.829
[Music]

5054.32 --> 5057.04
dave murphy's

5058.48 --> 5063.36
uh

5059.44 --> 5066.638999999999
i might have tony is that a recent video

5063.36 --> 5066.639
or is it from a while back

5068.719 --> 5074.159
you think i should be more cautious

5071.679 --> 5074.159
hello

5077.12 --> 5083.88
i think i'm pretty cautious

5080.88 --> 5083.88
i

5084.239 --> 5088.879999999999
more importantly i'm not afraid i'm not

5086.96 --> 5092.4
like oh i'm not going to be like

5088.88 --> 5094.400000000001
arrogant trying to like bend

5092.4 --> 5096.5599999999995
spirits to my will or something like

5094.4 --> 5097.759999999999
some nether mancer

5096.56 --> 5100.88
okay

5097.76 --> 5103.84
i don't i'm not like that

5100.88 --> 5107.52
i don't like to like enslave minds i

5103.84 --> 5109.28
actually like to free them up right

5107.52 --> 5113.080000000001
and i'm gonna deal with spirits then

5109.28 --> 5113.08
i'll bring them peace

5125.04 --> 5131.28
clutch should be completely avoided

5127.6 --> 5131.280000000001
oh borders boy i think that

5132.4 --> 5138.0
pretty much most people in chat here are

5136.08 --> 5141.0
kind of thinking that about you at this

5138.0 --> 5141.0
point

5142.719 --> 5146.96
seem to have like bumped into some kind

5145.52 --> 5148.4800000000005
of like

5146.96 --> 5150.96
obstacle

5148.48 --> 5153.44
that's probably rooted in relief

5150.96 --> 5154.639
religious priesthood conviction of some

5153.44 --> 5156.96
kind

5154.639 --> 5159.84
that's making you impossible to

5156.96 --> 5161.44
basically assert properly what's going

5159.84 --> 5163.76
on what's being discussed and

5161.44 --> 5165.678999999999
assimilated

5163.76 --> 5166.84
you're just putting your heels in the

5165.679 --> 5171.12
sand

5166.84 --> 5173.4400000000005
like this is just bad well

5171.12 --> 5175.76
sorry to tell you if that's how you

5173.44 --> 5178.719
really feel then you arrived at the

5175.76 --> 5178.719
wrong place i mean

5179.76 --> 5185.360000000001
i do spiritual stuff

5182.96 --> 5188.08
all the time

5185.36 --> 5190.4
i don't go looking for trouble with

5188.08 --> 5192.0
magic and [ __ ] i'm all very well aware

5190.4 --> 5195.04
of that

5192.0 --> 5198.32
i'm a i'm a good wizard i'm

5195.04 --> 5201.679
i don't [ __ ] around

5198.32 --> 5203.28
i know the consequences of that i've

5201.679 --> 5205.6
lived through

5203.28 --> 5207.92
consequences of that

5205.6 --> 5209.1990000000005
i was very lucky to get

5207.92 --> 5212.08
out of there

5209.199 --> 5214.799999999999
relatively unscathed but i've taken my

5212.08 --> 5217.44
lessons very serious when i was doing a

5214.8 --> 5220.4800000000005
lot of spiritual investigation earlier

5217.44 --> 5220.48
like 20 years ago

5220.639 --> 5225.84
oh thanks rick beck yeah jim bob

5222.48 --> 5225.839999999999
yesterday was excellent

5227.84 --> 5233.12
adorable because i'm a christian

5230.719 --> 5233.12
okay

5235.28 --> 5239.679
well

5237.52 --> 5241.92
i guess i'll see you around then borders

5239.679 --> 5241.92
boy

5242.0 --> 5247.199
because you're probably not really going

5243.679 --> 5247.1990000000005
to be visiting here anymore then

5249.84 --> 5257.400000000001
i mean either you're against evil

5252.639 --> 5257.400000000001
or you're against tools

5262.29 --> 5265.47
[Music]

5271.6 --> 5274.2390000000005
uh

5272.4 --> 5277.879999999999
not only i don't think i'm gonna be

5274.239 --> 5277.879999999999
interested in that

5300.159 --> 5306.719
right

5302.32 --> 5310.639
i mean i consider myself a christian

5306.719 --> 5312.8
but why because i take jesus's words

5310.639 --> 5314.96
extremely serious

5312.8 --> 5318.320000000001
i've recognized

5314.96 --> 5321.199
like vast fractal

5318.32 --> 5323.04
potential that is still that's

5321.199 --> 5325.36
like palpably

5323.04 --> 5329.199
altered the way

5325.36 --> 5332.08
spirit things work in this world

5329.199 --> 5333.28
i absolutely recognize him for

5332.08 --> 5335.679
the power

5333.28 --> 5336.8
that is literally available right there

5335.679 --> 5339.4400000000005
for you

5336.8 --> 5341.360000000001
to learn from and use and apply

5339.44 --> 5344.159
yeah that's my focus that's my

5341.36 --> 5346.639
christianity not

5344.159 --> 5348.799999999999
what all these other people in the book

5346.639 --> 5353.28
might have said

5348.8 --> 5355.6
and then in order to like drum up a very

5353.28 --> 5358.96
narrow code of conduct and tell you like

5355.6 --> 5361.1990000000005
you can literally do nothing

5358.96 --> 5361.199
right

5362.84 --> 5368.08
now if you were for example amish

5366.4 --> 5370.0
then i'd be like yeah of course you want

5368.08 --> 5372.08
to stay the hell away from divination

5370.0 --> 5375.52
and [ __ ] of course right you already

5372.08 --> 5377.679
made so much effort not engaging with

5375.52 --> 5381.6
staying away from

5377.679 --> 5385.12
electronics and computers and all that

5381.6 --> 5385.120000000001
then it makes sense

5389.12 --> 5393.8
what

5390.08 --> 5393.8
bloodlines what

5396.0 --> 5400.08
but yeah i'm a freaking wizard

5399.04 --> 5402.32
i

5400.08 --> 5404.96
claim it

5402.32 --> 5407.759999999999
but i will absolutely

5404.96 --> 5409.92
have basically jesus christ watching

5407.76 --> 5412.400000000001
over my shoulder constantly i want that

5409.92 --> 5412.4
i want

5412.56 --> 5418.320000000001
to figure this out from a good

5414.48 --> 5420.159
perspective and do good and yeah if

5418.32 --> 5422.08
you're going to combine good and magic

5420.159 --> 5424.239
that's gonna mean

5422.08 --> 5427.679
minimize the magic

5424.239 --> 5427.678999999999
that's just a universal

5429.04 --> 5433.44
right the best magic is the one you

5431.28 --> 5436.8
don't use

5433.44 --> 5436.799999999999
but that you could use

5446.32 --> 5450.96
right to me magic is much more just

5448.639 --> 5452.96
about understanding what exists and what

5450.96 --> 5455.36
can be possible and the dynamics of the

5452.96 --> 5455.36
mind

5456.239 --> 5460.4
after you get reach a certain level of

5458.32 --> 5464.5599999999995
understanding about all that

5460.4 --> 5468.32
there's no point in doing it anymore

5464.56 --> 5468.320000000001
it's like children's toys

5468.639 --> 5474.56
right it doesn't have that specific

5470.96 --> 5478.32
meaning anymore because you moved on

5474.56 --> 5481.04
you understand what it is now

5478.32 --> 5482.88
it's just a toy

5481.04 --> 5485.36
it's not something that it needs to be

5482.88 --> 5488.4800000000005
like worshiped or something

5485.36 --> 5491.28
or even held on too tightly maybe for

5488.48 --> 5493.04
like sentimental value right

5491.28 --> 5494.08
well

5493.04 --> 5497.96
that's

5494.08 --> 5497.96
how i approach it

5512.239 --> 5516.879999999999
that's right it is what you choose to do

5515.28 --> 5520.08
it's all about the choice that's the

5516.88 --> 5522.56
entire point and you can't get rid of

5520.08 --> 5525.84
evil

5522.56 --> 5527.679
by limiting choices even

5525.84 --> 5532.1990000000005
because it's gonna find its way through

5527.679 --> 5532.1990000000005
anyway with a vengeance usually

5535.56 --> 5538.649
[Music]

5554.75 --> 5561.199
[Music]

5556.96 --> 5563.92
yeah you don't need to

5561.199 --> 5567.4
talk about that sort of thing rufus

5563.92 --> 5567.4
don't do that

5577.92 --> 5583.36
christian spiritualists

5581.12 --> 5586.36
oh what are they doing

5583.36 --> 5586.36
right

5658.32 --> 5661.32
right

5677.12 --> 5681.44
right leave your communication with the

5679.28 --> 5683.759999999999
dead but it's just like accepting the

5681.44 --> 5685.678999999999
connection that's there how many times

5683.76 --> 5687.76
in communication

5685.679 --> 5690.96
right when you really like you can't get

5687.76 --> 5692.88
to a person because they simply do not

5690.96 --> 5697.199
accept

5692.88 --> 5697.1990000000005
what is there for them to take

5697.28 --> 5700.719
right

5698.239 --> 5704.879999999999
as i like to say god tells you

5700.719 --> 5708.719
everything all the time it's right there

5704.88 --> 5710.56
you're just unable to like

5708.719 --> 5715.199
fully grasp it

5710.56 --> 5717.4400000000005
it's not god's fault it's your

5715.199 --> 5720.159
yeah

5717.44 --> 5721.839999999999
your inability

5720.159 --> 5724.239
they need to work on that right because

5721.84 --> 5726.32
you need to keep catching god's

5724.239 --> 5729.839999999999
information

5726.32 --> 5729.84
that comes through everything

5745.6 --> 5748.6
what

5760.159 --> 5763.159
hmm

5771.28 --> 5777.28
rounding out the show somewhere

5774.4 --> 5777.28
next 10 minutes

5781.119 --> 5787.08
oh we certainly been all over the place

5783.52 --> 5787.080000000001
on today's show

5812.76 --> 5816.39
[Music]

5821.33 --> 5825.859
[Music]

5841.36 --> 5845.5199999999995
thing you just said is a great subject

5848.48 --> 5852.799999999999
no i'm gonna not i'm not gonna talk

5850.639 --> 5855.92
about like urine therapy and all that

5852.8 --> 5855.92
i'm just not gonna do it

5868.719 --> 5873.52
i'm not gonna shame it i don't like it i

5871.52 --> 5875.92
don't do it

5873.52 --> 5878.88
i do recognize that there is some

5875.92 --> 5883.119
interesting things about it

5878.88 --> 5887.84
it's definitely not complete nonsense

5883.119 --> 5892.04
but i don't like it it's not my thing

5887.84 --> 5892.04
i don't want to talk about it

5926.88 --> 5929.88
dammit

5934.88 --> 5938.06
[Music]

5945.92 --> 5950.32
yeah that's cute

5948.0 --> 5954.32
i'm going to time you out now

5950.32 --> 5954.32
don't you don't want to talk about it

5954.94 --> 5959.199
[Music]

5956.239 --> 5959.199
my tea leaves

5959.92 --> 5967.04
i don't need that

5962.719 --> 5969.28
it's like just ask me a question

5967.04 --> 5969.28
right

5969.92 --> 5975.76
i don't need to do little thingies i

5973.119 --> 5980.48
don't need to focus i just need somebody

5975.76 --> 5981.92
to ask a question and there it is right

5980.48 --> 5984.0
that's what i do

5981.92 --> 5986.08
somebody asks a really good detailed

5984.0 --> 5988.639
question and there is energy backing it

5986.08 --> 5989.679
and potential then i can suddenly break

5988.639 --> 5992.32
open

5989.679 --> 5994.96
to that level

5992.32 --> 5999.719
i don't need tea leaves

5994.96 --> 5999.719
to prepare myself on doing that

6011.76 --> 6015.04
getting timed out for agreeing with me

6013.52 --> 6017.4400000000005
yeah that's not allowed don't you

6015.04 --> 6020.67
understand you can't

6017.44 --> 6022.799999999999
just agree with me

6020.67 --> 6025.6
[Music]

6022.8 --> 6027.6
what the hell are you talking about

6025.6 --> 6029.360000000001
he wouldn't stop talking about freaking

6027.6 --> 6031.280000000001
urine therapy

6029.36 --> 6034.759999999999
when they already said i don't want to

6031.28 --> 6034.759999999999
talk about it

6045.52 --> 6050.119000000001
do you wanna time our two biscuit box

6050.239 --> 6054.638999999999
i mean

6052.19 --> 6055.839999999999
[Music]

6054.639 --> 6057.679
entering

6055.84 --> 6060.4800000000005
speaking up in my chat for the first

6057.679 --> 6061.4400000000005
time and then complaining

6060.48 --> 6063.28
about

6061.44 --> 6066.48
my chat policy

6063.28 --> 6069.679
yeah there's a very specific rule about

6066.48 --> 6072.879999999999
that in the description box

6069.679 --> 6075.76
well not very specific it's close enough

6072.88 --> 6079.400000000001
right so hey

6075.76 --> 6079.400000000001
that's what you want

6104.0 --> 6109.44
all right more for any more i'm rounding

6106.8 --> 6109.4400000000005
out right now

6110.48 --> 6115.119
oh did you tie me out i what the hell

6112.96 --> 6117.199
are you talking about

6115.119 --> 6119.04
no topics just signed yeah it seems so

6117.199 --> 6121.199
it seems that everybody's just doing

6119.04 --> 6122.88
other stuff and like working in the

6121.199 --> 6126.08
background i don't know i don't know if

6122.88 --> 6126.08
they're even still watching

6127.36 --> 6132.719
maybe they're just tripping over some

6129.28 --> 6134.719
words that i said previously i do

6132.719 --> 6136.719
kind of tend to cause that

6134.719 --> 6139.119
sometimes

6136.719 --> 6142.2390000000005
it's like oh yeah here's just this very

6139.119 --> 6144.48
detailed boulder of spirit mechanics is

6142.239 --> 6148.08
it just like oh bang just like that and

6144.48 --> 6150.159
then people were like whoa

6148.08 --> 6154.159
and they basically start dancing around

6150.159 --> 6157.32
it even though i've already moved on

6154.159 --> 6157.32
it happens

6166.8 --> 6172.159000000001
okay

6169.119 --> 6174.4

so thanks everyone for coming

6252.32 --> 6256.48
i hope you liked this show

6254.08 --> 6258.4
i thought it was well

6256.48 --> 6260.239
good enough

6258.4 --> 6262.159
certainly a lot of interesting things

6260.239 --> 6265.5199999999995
that have happened like me getting on

6262.159 --> 6269.28
gymlop which is very exhilarating

6265.52 --> 6270.639
and yeah couple of subjects here

6269.28 --> 6274.239
are also

6270.639 --> 6276.639
decently good

6274.239 --> 6278.239
in between all the kind of silent pauses

6276.639 --> 6280.719
i know i'm not

6278.239 --> 6282.08
a fluid entertainer i am sorry i'm

6280.719 --> 6283.76
mostly

6282.08 --> 6285.92
or a lot of the time just kind of

6283.76 --> 6287.52
staring at chat waiting for somebody to

6285.92 --> 6289.04
say something that i can do something

6287.52 --> 6290.080000000001
with

6289.04 --> 6292.0
because

6290.08 --> 6293.679
i just don't have a habit of just oh i

6292.0 --> 6298.4
just gotta keep talking i gotta keep to

6293.679 --> 6298.4
i specifically cut that off

6299.52 --> 6302.56
to

6300.32 --> 6304.799999999999
ensure that i'm not gonna end up just

6302.56 --> 6307.280000000001
blabbering about nonsense and then like

6304.8 --> 6310.400000000001
feeling forced i have to lower myself

6307.28 --> 6312.48
down to this level or i can't keep

6310.4 --> 6314.159
talking

6312.48 --> 6316.879999999999
i said no

6314.159 --> 6319.679
better to just be silent

6316.88 --> 6323.1990000000005
than to end up blabbering things that

6319.679 --> 6325.4400000000005
aren't really all that useful

6323.199 --> 6327.839999999999
so that's just what i do i hope you can

6325.44 --> 6330.239
deal with that

6327.84 --> 6332.32
because if not yeah watching my show is

6330.239 --> 6334.0
probably going to be a bit annoying to

6332.32 --> 6335.36
you

6334.0 --> 6337.84
anyway

6335.36 --> 6339.28
i hope you guys all appreciated it if

6337.84 --> 6341.52
you did then please don't forget to

6339.28 --> 6343.199
