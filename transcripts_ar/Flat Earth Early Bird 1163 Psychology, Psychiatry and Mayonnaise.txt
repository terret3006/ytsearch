for groceries

103.439 --> 110.96
and then when i got back it was not dry

last five minutes guess what happened

158.08 --> 163.12
yeah

159.519 --> 163.12

and thus yeah

167.519 --> 170.87900000000002
i

168.239 --> 172.56
basically started cursing and nobody was

170.879 --> 177.28

storm so i just almost blew my voice out

179.04 --> 181.35999999999999

186.879 --> 189.84
just that ugh

191.44 --> 195.04
i really don't like this weather which

193.36 --> 198.04000000000002
is ironic since i do live in the

195.04 --> 198.04
netherlands

199.92 --> 205.2
right

200.8 --> 205.20000000000002

240.48 --> 245.04
good interview video on spacebusters

245.92 --> 250.159
him and another guy

247.84 --> 253.20000000000002
that he knows basically talking about

250.159 --> 255.12
medical situation and psychology even in

253.2 --> 257.68
their accounts

255.12 --> 260.4
dealing with doctors

257.68 --> 264.16
and and their knowledge so it's it's a

260.4 --> 266.0
really good video i've i'm 45 minutes

264.16 --> 268.08000000000004
into it

266.0 --> 270.16
i definitely recommend you guys watch

268.08 --> 272.71999999999997
that so i'm gonna link it up

270.16 --> 272.72
for later

274.4 --> 276.0
or

275.199 --> 277.68
if i

276.0 --> 280.24
really think i'm boring you can just

277.68 --> 280.24
watch that

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
but i hope not

285.44 --> 289.919
oh man

286.96 --> 292.56
right i did actually get an illuminati

289.919 --> 294.88
croissant

292.56 --> 297.759
because it was some 50 discount so i

294.88 --> 300.4
thought okay okay

297.759 --> 300.40000000000003
fair enough

305.759 --> 309.91900000000004
but yeah i'll get to that probably later

308.16 --> 310.88000000000005
i'm not super hungry in this moment i'm

309.919 --> 314.479
still

310.88 --> 314.479
trying to process like all the

314.8 --> 319.12
like the muscle

317.44 --> 320.16
sourness

319.12 --> 323.199
from

320.16 --> 325.36
yeah going in against insane winds and

323.199 --> 329.199
being pissed off and then doubling down

325.36 --> 333.52000000000004
like no i am not going to lose speed

329.199 --> 334.96000000000004
it's just me being very very stubborn

333.52 --> 336.96
ugh

334.96 --> 339.84
it does give you a bit of a good workout

336.96 --> 339.84
but

347.6 --> 351.199
yeah [ __ ] weather over there too gadget

349.6 --> 354.16
inspector

351.199 --> 356.56
i think everywhere north

354.16 --> 358.16
north of the equator

356.56 --> 359.039
like it is

358.16 --> 361.6
yeah

359.039 --> 365.44
the netherlands england

361.6 --> 365.44
probably denmark too and

365.68 --> 370.0
in the coast of america

368.0 --> 372.72
probably all have this kind of shitty

370.0 --> 372.72
weather right now

372.8 --> 377.28000000000003
although in america it's still freezing

374.88 --> 379.26
i think most of the most of the places

377.28 --> 382.399
there

379.26 --> 382.399
[Music]

385.68 --> 390.72
yeah we haven't seen any any

388.479 --> 391.59999999999997
little bit of snow

390.72 --> 393.199
here

391.6 --> 395.759
like that

393.199 --> 397.199
had been free it has frozen a couple of

395.759 --> 398.56
times

397.199 --> 400.0
in the night

398.56 --> 403.039
and hail

400.0 --> 406.16
there's been hail in like in between

403.039 --> 409.84
rainstorms but no snow none whatsoever

406.16 --> 409.84000000000003
this year oh well

414.72 --> 417.03900000000004
right

417.84 --> 423.84
so yeah guys how are you doing

420.16 --> 423.84000000000003
have you been up to

430.24 --> 434.72
any reflections on yesterday's show i

432.479 --> 436.71999999999997
did actually watch it

434.72 --> 439.03900000000004
i also watched from the day before by

436.72 --> 441.12
the way i yeah there wasn't there wasn't

439.039 --> 442.88
a lot of videos on

441.12 --> 444.72
live streams on

442.88 --> 446.56
this sunday

444.72 --> 448.84000000000003
like i barely got notified i still got

446.56 --> 451.12
notification just in my

448.84 --> 453.919
first page view

451.12 --> 455.68
of the notifications from saturday it's

453.919 --> 458.79999999999995
been that

455.68 --> 458.8
that little stream

463.28 --> 466.96
that little amount of streams

468.16 --> 470.47900000000004
right

473.68 --> 479.199
but i had some good shows especially i

476.4 --> 482.4
wanted to watch back yesterday

479.199 --> 484.40000000000003
the second half from saturday

482.4 --> 486.15999999999997
my mayonnaise movies in the medical

484.4 --> 487.75899999999996
system show

486.16 --> 490.879
because in the second half i was

487.759 --> 493.44
explaining more of my i really

490.879 --> 495.12
made another go to put down my

493.44 --> 496.56
understanding of how the celestial

495.12 --> 499.919
lights work

496.56 --> 499.919
i did it really well

500.0 --> 504.4
i've come far it's it's kind of weird

501.919 --> 507.28
saying that about yourself

504.4 --> 510.15999999999997
but i do remember watching back like a

507.28 --> 513.919
few years ago when i tried to explain it

510.16 --> 514.88
and i would be a lot more hesitant and

513.919 --> 516.24
well not

514.88 --> 519.519
like

516.24 --> 521.76
having more trouble just

519.519 --> 525.04
making it fluid and this time it was

521.76 --> 528.16
super fluid so i've really upgraded my

525.04 --> 531.76
overall ability to explain it

528.16 --> 531.76
and i'm very satisfied with that

532.72 --> 536.88
because it's important

534.48 --> 541.36
i'm one of the few people that just

536.88 --> 542.399
even chooses to have a specific cohesive

541.36 --> 543.44
view

542.399 --> 545.36
like this

543.44 --> 547.7600000000001
that i know of there's other people that

545.36 --> 549.76
will say oh it's this it's that

547.76 --> 552.24
but they don't actually

549.76 --> 554.08
it's just like

552.24 --> 556.88
hints to them

554.08 --> 559.2
just have fragments of like oh i saw

556.88 --> 562.24
this somebody said that and he explained

559.2 --> 564.48
it well i i'm gonna go with that no when

562.24 --> 568.16
i'm talking about it i have like the

564.48 --> 569.76
complete mechanical oversight of what i

568.16 --> 572.0799999999999
think it is

569.76 --> 577.64
and what will be

572.08 --> 577.64
discovered when we even test it

577.68 --> 583.76
lay down all the works

580.48 --> 583.76
so that's a big difference

587.2 --> 593.519
a classical homeopath and gaining wisdom

591.12 --> 593.519
troll

593.839 --> 597.24
who's projecting

605.04 --> 607.92
of course he is

608.079 --> 613.04
yeah i'd like to say by the way that

610.24 --> 617.12
since i'm off with vitamin d3

613.04 --> 617.12
although it's still only a correlation

617.76 --> 623.4399999999999
i seem to have so much more

620.079 --> 626.4799999999999
mood control towards other people

623.44 --> 626.48
anybody notice that

627.36 --> 631.2
because it's not like the first time

629.279 --> 633.2
i've attempted to like oh i'm gonna get

631.2 --> 635.6
control of it now oh i'm really gonna do

633.2 --> 638.8000000000001
my best yeah and then it usually doesn't

635.6 --> 638.8000000000001
work out well guess what

639.68 --> 644.7199999999999
since a few days

641.44 --> 647.6
that i've stopped taking it

644.72 --> 649.279
i am much more in control it's just

647.6 --> 652.0
palpable

649.279 --> 654.72
so yeah that's

652.0 --> 657.519
it is fascinating to me

654.72 --> 660.9200000000001
apparently there is this influence

657.519 --> 660.92
about it

667.92 --> 674.04
yeah aaron armstrong everybody has been

670.079 --> 674.04
abandoned even you

674.88 --> 677.519
it's a fresh

676.24 --> 678.32
start

677.519 --> 680.72
but

678.32 --> 682.8000000000001
you can absolutely screw it up fall back

680.72 --> 684.32
into old habits that got you banned in

682.8 --> 687.1999999999999
the first place

684.32 --> 688.48
and then get banned again so

687.2 --> 690.9590000000001
don't get any

688.48 --> 696.2
get any ideas

690.959 --> 696.1999999999999
that it's now free for all here it isn't

702.0 --> 706.079
no

703.519 --> 709.36
borders boy i am going to do a flat

706.079 --> 711.68
earth early bird show

709.36 --> 713.76
every day

711.68 --> 715.68
every day

713.76 --> 718.959
and i'm going to talk about whatever i

715.68 --> 721.279
want that's going to include movies

718.959 --> 724.0
food

721.279 --> 727.4399999999999
psychology a lot

724.0 --> 730.639
social engineering media

727.44 --> 734.9200000000001
propaganda from governments

730.639 --> 734.92
and ideological organizations

734.959 --> 740.7199999999999
flat earth mechanics physics

737.6 --> 743.519
physics relating to flat earth

740.72 --> 745.9200000000001
conceptual physics relating to the globe

743.519 --> 749.6
earth i'm gonna talk about all that

745.92 --> 751.12
and i'm not gonna do gaming streams

749.6 --> 755.6800000000001
you understand

751.12 --> 755.68
that's a complete waste of my faculties

756.88 --> 760.24
it's kind of funny that you mention it

758.48 --> 762.8000000000001
because yesterday i just randomly

760.24 --> 764.399
clicked on something on d live

762.8 --> 766.079
because it was that

764.399 --> 767.839
i was kind of bored at the moment right

766.079 --> 770.079
and that's a sin

767.839 --> 773.2
so i just clicked on some oh this is

770.079 --> 776.959
promoted by d life some guy from

773.2 --> 776.9590000000001
sweden or something gaming

777.76 --> 783.04
and

779.68 --> 784.079
it was so boring

783.04 --> 787.8389999999999
it's like

784.079 --> 787.8389999999999
they're literally talking about nothing

788.16 --> 792.56
so no

789.44 --> 792.5600000000001
i'm not gonna do that

793.6 --> 797.519
there's plenty of people doing that and

795.519 --> 799.76
it's boring as [ __ ]

797.519 --> 802.32
if you don't like what i do then you go

799.76 --> 804.399
to your random recommended gaming

802.32 --> 805.839
streams and go and watch that and stop

804.399 --> 806.6
nagging me

805.839 --> 808.8000000000001

890.88 --> 895.36
uh well

892.56 --> 895.3599999999999
that's different

895.68 --> 901.519
when i game i don't just game unless i'm

899.36 --> 904.8000000000001
mostly enjoying the music then i just

901.519 --> 908.32
turn everything else off but when i game

904.8 --> 912.079
i always kind of watch media with that

908.32 --> 913.6800000000001
which sometimes is alex jones

912.079 --> 917.519
or

913.68 --> 917.519
like a premiere in the background

917.92 --> 922.4799999999999
i never just game

921.12 --> 925.44
well yeah

922.48 --> 927.9200000000001
unless i'm just like trying to zone out

925.44 --> 931.2790000000001
but that's not interesting it's not

927.92 --> 931.279
interesting to watch that

931.68 --> 935.56
doesn't make any sense

947.92 --> 950.88
yeah hello jose

953.519 --> 957.16
seeking star wars

981.519 --> 986.88
doesn't fight no nobody cares gadget

983.839 --> 986.8800000000001
inspector about him

990.959 --> 996.959
there's lit there's nothing noteworthy

994.72 --> 999.839
i would be able to know about him that

996.959 --> 999.8389999999999
would be worth it

1000.079 --> 1004.4799999999999
the guy is such

1002.079 --> 1007.92
i i yeah i'm just gonna give him the

1004.48 --> 1007.9200000000001
amish treatment he's just

1009.36 --> 1013.92
just get away from me

1011.6 --> 1013.9200000000001
ill

1020.32 --> 1023.279
ever thought of getting some guests on

1022.16 --> 1024.48
yeah

1023.279 --> 1028.64
thought of it

1024.48 --> 1028.64
and i chose not to do that

1035.839 --> 1041.839
i mean if like some of subject arrives

1042.16 --> 1047.28
that needs discussing like between me

1044.559 --> 1048.72
and the the fed guys

1047.28 --> 1051.039
then i might

1048.72 --> 1054.16
do a separate stream or something

1051.039 --> 1057.2
or yeah because most people don't really

1054.16 --> 1060.24
have this specific time slot available

1057.2 --> 1062.0800000000002
for them to do things

1060.24 --> 1063.44
except maybe listen to something while

1062.08 --> 1064.84
they're doing something else and that's

1063.44 --> 1067.039
why my show is

1064.84 --> 1069.4399999999998
here but

1067.039 --> 1070.559
i might do like a separate uh night owl

1069.44 --> 1074.3600000000001
stream

1070.559 --> 1074.36
like i did last time

1092.84 --> 1098.08
let's yeah bartus boy maybe but it's

1096.72 --> 1101.1200000000001
gross

1098.08 --> 1103.4399999999998
i don't want to make money like that

1101.12 --> 1104.9599999999998
i don't want to

1103.44 --> 1106.4
i don't think the system is going to

1104.96 --> 1108.24
give that to me

1106.4 --> 1110.88
i think that because of everything else

1108.24 --> 1112.32
i do here even if i did attempt like a

1110.88 --> 1115.6000000000001
gaming stream

1112.32 --> 1116.8799999999999
i would be immediately just cut off from

1115.6 --> 1119.28
everything

1116.88 --> 1120.4
nobody would find me i would not build

1119.28 --> 1123.6
up to that

1120.4 --> 1125.2
because i do what i do

1123.6 --> 1128.0
don't you get that

1125.2 --> 1130.559
it doesn't work

1128.0 --> 1135.24
i'm not going to be allowed to grow like

1130.559 --> 1135.24
that it's not going to be happening

1151.2 --> 1156.4
right because yeah what if

1153.84 --> 1158.799
because of what i do what if i just that

1156.4 --> 1160.64
like oh big gaming i'm just going to be

1158.799 --> 1161.44
a gamer

1160.64 --> 1163.6000000000001
well

1161.44 --> 1165.76
they would expect me to then just at

1163.6 --> 1169.6789999999999
some point get bored and start talking

1165.76 --> 1169.679
about flat earth cosmogeny again

1170.32 --> 1174.48
like what if in the middle of my game

1172.64 --> 1176.24
i just start start talking about yeah

1174.48 --> 1177.6
glow of the heavens it's all holographic

1176.24 --> 1179.76
blah blah

1177.6 --> 1181.6789999999999
like no

1179.76 --> 1183.679
they don't want that that's not

1181.679 --> 1185.919
something that's safe for the wider

1183.679 --> 1188.64
public the numpties that are out there

1185.919 --> 1192.0800000000002
to be bored and stare at screens as

1188.64 --> 1193.8400000000001
other people play stupid games

1192.08 --> 1196.48
they either won't be listening or

1193.84 --> 1198.559
they'll be creeped out or something

1196.48 --> 1201.3600000000001
it's not gonna work

1198.559 --> 1205.32
i'm not media trained as

1201.36 --> 1205.32
which is a euphemism

1206.64 --> 1211.6000000000001
i can't help but go

1209.039 --> 1214.1589999999999
mega high level consciousness and

1211.6 --> 1217.6789999999999
basically invade people's head that are

1214.159 --> 1221.5590000000002
watching i can't help it i can't help it

1217.679 --> 1221.5590000000002
i have to do that

1221.679 --> 1225.919
and

1222.64 --> 1228.3200000000002
the system the beast knows that about me

1225.919 --> 1230.88
it's counting on it but it has to keep

1228.32 --> 1233.9189999999999
me contained

1230.88 --> 1237.5200000000002
i can't explode out there i can't reach

1233.919 --> 1241.0
too many people i do too much damage

1237.52 --> 1241.0
from their perspective

1243.83 --> 1251.12
[Music]

1248.799 --> 1254.1589999999999
right but there's another way though

1251.12 --> 1256.32
there is another way that i

1254.159 --> 1258.24
can achieve something similar and that

1256.32 --> 1263.039
is

1258.24 --> 1265.919
you like what i do you want me to grow

1263.039 --> 1268.08
well you support me you could do a

1265.919 --> 1270.88
gaming stream

1268.08 --> 1272.24
not have the in arwinian impulses to

1270.88 --> 1275.3600000000001
like like

1272.24 --> 1278.24
put down mind-blowing things

1275.36 --> 1280.32
going to shock people

1278.24 --> 1282.24
and then make that money

1280.32 --> 1284.8799999999999
and then you could donate some of that

1282.24 --> 1287.679
money to my paypal

1284.88 --> 1289.3600000000001
right it's a win-win situation you have

1287.679 --> 1291.919
all that money from the gaming stream

1289.36 --> 1294.24
that's no problem to you

1291.919 --> 1297.1200000000001
i get my money so i get my food and i

1294.24 --> 1298.88
can still do my thing

1297.12 --> 1301.12
and awake people

1298.88 --> 1303.2800000000002
and focus on that

1301.12 --> 1306.1589999999999
so that people that are

1303.28 --> 1308.72
knowingly coming here to my channel for

1306.159 --> 1311.6000000000001
that get what they need

1308.72 --> 1313.3600000000001
and i don't disrupt the the idiot

1311.6 --> 1315.4399999999998
numpties out there that can't handle

1313.36 --> 1317.28
that win win

1315.44 --> 1318.559
you win a little money you give me your

1317.28 --> 1320.72
money

i give those people that secret what

1320.72 --> 1325.919
they need i don't disrupt the numpties

1323.28 --> 1327.2
win win win everybody wins you give me

1325.919 --> 1329.5200000000002

1329.52 --> 1332.9189999999999
how about that

1334.72 --> 1340.84
oh flatter stage

1336.799 --> 1340.84
that's what i'm talking about

1350.559 --> 1355.72
whoa dude nice

1352.799 --> 1358.84
thank you very much that's very helpful

1355.72 --> 1362.4
[Music]

1358.84 --> 1362.3999999999999
25. thank you

1362.96 --> 1365.679
that's great

1373.76 --> 1379.52
uh hello mr pickle oh everybody wants to

1376.64 --> 1384.0800000000002
know about the nathan oakley and irwin's

1379.52 --> 1385.039
chat scandal i timed him out

1384.08 --> 1388.559
i

1385.039 --> 1394.4
timed out nathan oakley

1388.559 --> 1394.3999999999999
a legendary event oh my god what happens

1395.44 --> 1397.679
yeah

1398.32 --> 1402.32
now it went a bit overboard nathan was

1400.799 --> 1404.4
basically

1402.32 --> 1406.3999999999999
doing chat

1404.4 --> 1407.76
jet yeah chat

1406.4 --> 1410.159
gnawing

1407.76 --> 1412.24
chewing down on the ballers and

1410.159 --> 1413.8400000000001
then phil bell basically shared a little

1412.24 --> 1416.32
detail

1413.84 --> 1417.6789999999999
that was kind of shocking that's painful

1416.32 --> 1420.1589999999999
and

1417.679 --> 1422.3200000000002
and nathan basically disregarded it or

1420.159 --> 1423.919
overlooked it and kept going on a very

1422.32 --> 1425.6789999999999
brutal way

1423.919 --> 1427.279
and that seemed out of po out of place

1425.679 --> 1431.679
to me

1427.279 --> 1434.32
seemed inappropriate so i timed them out

1431.679 --> 1435.2
because yeah

1434.32 --> 1436.08
just

1435.2 --> 1438.32
like

1436.08 --> 1441.039
if he wants to do that on his live show

1438.32 --> 1443.52
or in his chats i'm not stopping him

1441.039 --> 1446.1589999999999
but i am stopping him if he's doing that

1443.52 --> 1446.1589999999999
in my chat

1447.97 --> 1451.059
[Music]

1452.4 --> 1459.44
what was said well it was about

1456.0 --> 1462.4
triangles and just the usual

1459.44 --> 1464.88
and then i somehow feel like his son

1462.4 --> 1464.88
came up

1467.36 --> 1470.9599999999998
and nathan's basically i think it

1469.2 --> 1472.48
started out nathan started like yeah

1470.96 --> 1473.8400000000001
your son's going to be ashamed of you

1472.48 --> 1476.24
etc but

1473.84 --> 1478.24
then phil shared that his son had died

1476.24 --> 1479.52
actually

1478.24 --> 1482.48
so

1479.52 --> 1484.559
but nathan seemed to had overlooked that

1482.48 --> 1488.72
because he kept on doing that that's

1484.559 --> 1488.72
just like that's i don't want that

1493.44 --> 1499.1200000000001
so i'm gonna take it like as if nathan

1496.08 --> 1499.12
just made a mistake

1499.2 --> 1503.3600000000001
but it doesn't matter i just had to time

1501.039 --> 1503.36
it out

1504.08 --> 1508.6399999999999
like phil wasn't gonna bend anyway so

1512.0 --> 1517.679
maybe it was the painkiller yeah well it

1513.919 --> 1517.679
could be for example yeah

1517.76 --> 1522.32
it doesn't matter

1519.039 --> 1522.32
it's all right i understand

1523.44 --> 1527.44
and

1524.24 --> 1531.279
i get it right nathan does have like a

1527.44 --> 1534.159
high level allergy to lying

1531.279 --> 1536.96
i personally don't have that allergy

1534.159 --> 1538.7990000000002
now whether i'm lucky or unlucky because

1536.96 --> 1542.32
of that that's

1538.799 --> 1544.0
something to ponder upon

1542.32 --> 1546.48
but

1544.0 --> 1548.32
i'm much more about

1546.48 --> 1552.72
i'm allergic to

1548.32 --> 1554.6399999999999
like really uncivil behavior and

1552.72 --> 1557.1200000000001
like real bullying

1554.64 --> 1558.159
on the spiritual level it's complicated

1557.12 --> 1560.1589999999999
because that

1558.159 --> 1562.5590000000002
it's it is complex it's not as

1560.159 --> 1565.0390000000002
straightforward right because bullying

1562.559 --> 1566.32
is not just say reminding somebody of

1565.039 --> 1567.919
something they don't like about

1566.32 --> 1571.279
themselves

1567.919 --> 1574.0
bullying is really trying to break

1571.279 --> 1577.039
somebody psychologically

1574.0 --> 1577.039
to dominate them

1578.08 --> 1583.4399999999998
like and in a disrespect like without

1580.72 --> 1587.279
the intention to improve them only the

1583.44 --> 1589.6000000000001
intention to make them follow you

1587.279 --> 1590.96
like an attack autocratic bullying

1589.6 --> 1593.6789999999999
instead of

1590.96 --> 1596.08
just being really strict and basically

1593.679 --> 1599.0800000000002
doing it for somebody's own

1596.08 --> 1599.08
goodwill

1600.64 --> 1604.7990000000002
and that's that's for most people even

1602.64 --> 1606.0800000000002
like very diff difficult to even tell

1604.799 --> 1607.6
the difference

1606.08 --> 1610.48
it look they don't see the difference

1607.6 --> 1612.559
well i do i do i have that very refined

1610.48 --> 1616.08
sense

1612.559 --> 1618.32
and i really really hate people that do

1616.08 --> 1618.32
that

1620.24 --> 1625.44
and you have to be fair

1622.48 --> 1628.48
sometimes i think like nathan has

1625.44 --> 1631.76
slight elements of that in him

1628.48 --> 1633.679
but guess what i stand up to that oh yes

1631.76 --> 1636.24
oh yes i do

1633.679 --> 1638.5590000000002
and kiwi has it too but kiwi is just so

1636.24 --> 1640.72
freaking loud

1638.559 --> 1643.12
he's mostly just his

1640.72 --> 1645.6000000000001
moods just he basically does shoot

1643.12 --> 1647.36
himself in the foot most of the time

1645.6 --> 1649.6789999999999
with it

1647.36 --> 1650.9599999999998
it just blows his gunpowder constantly

1649.679 --> 1655.64
so

1650.96 --> 1655.64
it's i don't really he's not effective

1656.72 --> 1662.08
but nathan when he's like spiteful and

1659.2 --> 1664.72
he can be he can be like really

1662.08 --> 1666.6399999999999
bullying in a bad way and sometimes i'm

1664.72 --> 1668.559
ashamed of that

1666.64 --> 1673.1200000000001
there's really nothing i can do if i

1668.559 --> 1674.8799999999999
just speak up in the moment he'd explode

1673.12 --> 1676.559
so i don't know what to do about that

1674.88 --> 1678.72
there's nothing i can do about it only

1676.559 --> 1680.0
nathan can do something about that

1678.72 --> 1683.84
if he

1680.0 --> 1683.84
recognizes that about himself

1688.96 --> 1694.3990000000001
oh so toxic oh

1692.08 --> 1694.399
oh

1694.559 --> 1697.84
chewie strikes me as insecure

1700.399 --> 1705.36
that's right

1702.48 --> 1709.32
smart quick but oversensitive

1705.36 --> 1709.32
it he is over sensitive

1710.159 --> 1714.5590000000002
like i am oversensitive

1713.039 --> 1718.0
except i've

1714.559 --> 1720.8799999999999
like specialized in psychology

1718.0 --> 1722.799
not just pick up a few things but really

1720.88 --> 1725.2
specialize at it

1722.799 --> 1726.799
so i really know how to deal with

1725.2 --> 1729.2
oversensitivity

1726.799 --> 1731.279
qe does not

1729.2 --> 1733.039
but there are things that he can do and

1731.279 --> 1735.12
that is just freaking have your

1733.039 --> 1736.399
breakfast before you start socially

1735.12 --> 1738.559
communicating

1736.399 --> 1740.6399999999999
or reading text messages

1738.559 --> 1743.36
right as long as he does that things

1740.64 --> 1743.3600000000001
will work out

1751.76 --> 1756.799
q has the military mentality no

1754.72 --> 1759.679
no george sanford

1756.799 --> 1761.6
he has a flare of that he likes the stat

1759.679 --> 1763.1200000000001
the style he likes the culture he likes

1761.6 --> 1765.279
to reference it

1763.12 --> 1767.6
but somebody like qe in the way that he

1765.279 --> 1771.44
composes himself

1767.6 --> 1773.6
that's not military material

1771.44 --> 1776.48
military doesn't like people that glow

1773.6 --> 1780.0
their that blow their gun powder

1776.48 --> 1783.279
every single time some something happens

1780.0 --> 1783.279
so i disagree on that

1791.48 --> 1796.72
[Music]

1793.6 --> 1799.9189999999999
kiwi captain pugwash oh somebody's like

1796.72 --> 1803.279
here to squirt aren't they mr pickle

1799.919 --> 1803.279
are you in a bit of a pickle

1806.399 --> 1811.4399999999998
got some frustration

1808.64 --> 1811.44
with everybody

1812.799 --> 1817.44
what's the difference between psychology

1814.799 --> 1818.32
and psychiatry

1817.44 --> 1821.039
well

1818.32 --> 1823.4399999999998
there is a big difference

1821.039 --> 1826.48
psychology

1823.44 --> 1830.0800000000002
is much more about

1826.48 --> 1832.96
it's closer to sociology

1830.08 --> 1835.12
it's really the study of of people and

1832.96 --> 1838.32
behavior

1835.12 --> 1839.2399999999998
well psychiatry is much more about

1838.32 --> 1841.039
like

1839.24 --> 1842.72
biochemistry

1841.039 --> 1844.559
of the brain

1842.72 --> 1847.2
and

1844.559 --> 1849.52
really yeah it's more medical it's more

1847.2 --> 1852.799
interventionist it's more about like

1849.52 --> 1855.039
substances to correct things etc and it

1852.799 --> 1857.12
uses the psychiatric manual which is a

1855.039 --> 1858.32
complete fraud by the way that an entire

1857.12 --> 1860.2399999999998
thing

1858.32 --> 1862.72
though it has some interesting

1860.24 --> 1864.96
developments that are part of that but

1862.72 --> 1867.679
it's it's a fraud

1864.96 --> 1870.08
so psychiatry in my opinion is kind of a

1867.679 --> 1870.0800000000002
fraud

1870.48 --> 1873.2
it doesn't actually do what's supposed

1872.08 --> 1875.519
to be doing

1873.2 --> 1878.24
but yeah it it does like know about

1875.519 --> 1880.64
drugs and how to like remove extreme

1878.24 --> 1883.279
behavior so psychiatry

1880.64 --> 1884.7990000000002
at best is only really useful for the

1883.279 --> 1887.039
really like

1884.799 --> 1888.48
criminally insane

1887.039 --> 1892.72
people that are like

1888.48 --> 1894.88
really seriously bad deranged behavior

1892.72 --> 1896.48
that's like dangerous and [ __ ] right

1894.88 --> 1898.24
that's where psychiatry is kind of

1896.48 --> 1899.1200000000001
useful

1898.24 --> 1903.279
but

1899.12 --> 1904.799
other than that it's usually terrible

1903.279 --> 1907.36
overshoots

1904.799 --> 1909.279
the problems well psychology is much

1907.36 --> 1910.9599999999998
more of a it's more of a discipline it's

1909.279 --> 1913.12
a personal discipline of social

1910.96 --> 1914.88
interaction and figuring out what is

1913.12 --> 1917.36
driving people

1914.88 --> 1919.44
and can be there's so many different

1917.36 --> 1921.84
approaches there's many different angles

1919.44 --> 1923.519
of approach in psychology

1921.84 --> 1925.84
it's all kinds of different types of

1923.519 --> 1928.0
psychology there's like one psychology

1925.84 --> 1930.6399999999999
psychologist could have

1928.0 --> 1933.279
like completely incompatible approach

1930.64 --> 1934.88
with another psychologist yet you both

1933.279 --> 1936.559
have

1934.88 --> 1938.7990000000002
some success

1936.559 --> 1938.799
right

1941.519 --> 1946.559
okay mr pickle you're just

1944.08 --> 1949.799
a debbie downer

1946.559 --> 1949.799
get out

1974.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
don't do that again

1984.08 --> 1987.399
hello clutch

1990.159 --> 1995.24
all right okay it's time to clean house

2016.24 --> 2020.48
hello service day dr utger

2021.2 --> 2024.2
dx

2042.32 --> 2047.84
right so yeah i hope that answers that

2044.559 --> 2047.84
question steamy traveler

2051.679 --> 2053.919
man

2056.079 --> 2060.5600000000004
oh by the way apparently there have been

2058.48 --> 2063.2
over here there have been just trees

2060.56 --> 2064.96
that even blew blew over onto the

2063.2 --> 2066.72
streets and all that

2064.96 --> 2068.8
i heard my roommate mentioned that he

2066.72 --> 2070.399
bumped into a couple of situations where

2068.8 --> 2074.2000000000003
there was even like

2070.399 --> 2074.2
just crushed cars

2074.8 --> 2079.52
out there so the storm has been pretty

2076.96 --> 2079.52
heavy here

2085.919 --> 2089.0
all right

2092.159 --> 2096.7200000000003
right so yeah the funny thing is steamy

2094.24 --> 2098.2
traveler

2096.72 --> 2099.9199999999996
all depending on

2098.2 --> 2103.04
[Music]

2099.92 --> 2105.76
the individual psychologer

2103.04 --> 2108.64
like a psychologist can be atheist a

2105.76 --> 2111.6800000000003
psychologist can also

2108.64 --> 2114.64
be not atheist

2111.68 --> 2119.2
they can be religious or

2114.64 --> 2119.2
just god believer of any sort right

2119.28 --> 2124.4
because it's really about the discipline

2122.24 --> 2127.9199999999996
psychology is mostly just about

2124.4 --> 2129.52
understanding how people work why

2127.92 --> 2132.079
what are they thinking what are they

2129.52 --> 2134.48
feeling how does do p how do you respond

2132.079 --> 2137.119
to that how do others respond to that

2134.48 --> 2140.72
getting an understanding of that is the

2137.119 --> 2140.7200000000003
core essence of psychology

2142.4 --> 2145.28
right

2143.28 --> 2147.52
but the individual will always have

2145.28 --> 2150.88
their own angle of approach rose color

2147.52 --> 2152.56
darkly so yeah whatever they believe

2150.88 --> 2154.96
will filter

2152.56 --> 2157.04
or usually ends up filtering whatever

2154.96 --> 2159.52
they're going to

2157.04 --> 2161.44
analyze out there so for example if they

2159.52 --> 2163.7599999999998
are atheist

2161.44 --> 2167.28
they will always they they will always

2163.76 --> 2169.3590000000004
kind of lose track when religious people

2167.28 --> 2171.0400000000004
share like really deeply religious

2169.359 --> 2173.2799999999997
experiences

2171.04 --> 2175.2
or or when they

2173.28 --> 2177.28
they might discourage somebody that says

2175.2 --> 2179.839
yeah but my dreams have religious

2177.28 --> 2182.48
implications or i was this is a message

2179.839 --> 2184.24
from god then an atheist psychologist

2182.48 --> 2186.64
will be like

2184.24 --> 2188.3999999999996
yeah that's what you think right and

2186.64 --> 2190.0
that's okay if you think that because

2188.4 --> 2191.839
it's all about the end result blah blah

2190.0 --> 2194.0
blah right

2191.839 --> 2195.839
so psychologists can just be very

2194.0 --> 2197.359
different it all depends on where they

2195.839 --> 2199.52
are at

2197.359 --> 2202.24
personally with their convictions and

2199.52 --> 2202.24
their ideas

2206.88 --> 2211.28
whoa

2207.92 --> 2213.76

2331.68 --> 2335.44
like really nice barbecue sauce try it

2333.92 --> 2336.7200000000003
out

2335.44 --> 2338.4
mayonnaise

2336.72 --> 2340.8799999999997
little ketchup

2338.4 --> 2342.32
and a little bit of

2340.88 --> 2345.32
ginger syrup

2342.32 --> 2345.32
amazing

2354.16 --> 2358.0
that you don't have to delete that

2356.88 --> 2361.96
thanks

2358.0 --> 2361.96
it's just joking around

2383.359 --> 2387.839
they're not medically qualified yeah

2385.52 --> 2390.88
they're not part of the

2387.839 --> 2392.599
medical system the allopathic atheist

2390.88 --> 2394.48
medical system that's right

2392.599 --> 2397.92
psychiatrists

2394.48 --> 2399.119
as far as i'm concerned are all atheists

2397.92 --> 2401.28
yeah

2399.119 --> 2403.76
i forgot to mention that thanks for that

2401.28 --> 2405.92
borders roy boy

2403.76 --> 2408.8390000000004
so that's why psychiatrists are more

2405.92 --> 2410.64
easily compatible with government

2408.839 --> 2413.7599999999998
[ __ ]

2410.64 --> 2413.7599999999998
with the beast system

2416.88 --> 2420.7200000000003
the psychologists aren't

2418.88 --> 2423.599
necessarily that

2420.72 --> 2425.839
but a psychologist can actually help

2423.599 --> 2425.839
people

2432.16 --> 2437.5989999999997
right

2433.04 --> 2440.0
gives a [ __ ] about medical qualification

2437.599 --> 2443.839
you're not supposed to be doing that the

2440.0 --> 2446.0
psychologist talks let somebody talks

2443.839 --> 2448.0
right that's what you do and then you

2446.0 --> 2449.76
help them understand you give them

2448.0 --> 2452.079
tricks you give them

2449.76 --> 2453.3590000000004
some confidence

2452.079 --> 2455.8390000000004
you help them

2453.359 --> 2459.5989999999997
put things into place

2455.839 --> 2461.839
you don't need medical qualification

2459.599 --> 2464.0
you don't need to give them drugs to

2461.839 --> 2465.359
correct their mental issue that's

2464.0 --> 2469.2
ridiculous

2465.359 --> 2472.0789999999997
that entire premise is insane

2469.2 --> 2476.0
yeah that's you should never correct

2472.079 --> 2478.48
behavior through medical intervention

2476.0 --> 2480.8
right that's a

2478.48 --> 2483.44
like desperate solution that's something

2480.8 --> 2487.04
you might consider when somebody is like

2483.44 --> 2488.48
a raving violent

2487.04 --> 2491.2799999999997
killer

2488.48 --> 2492.64
insane killer or like somebody that's

2491.28 --> 2495.2000000000003
just super

2492.64 --> 2495.92
like self-mutilation like people that

2495.2 --> 2498.72
are

2495.92 --> 2500.8
really causing physical harm to

2498.72 --> 2503.1189999999997
themselves and others that's when you

2500.8 --> 2505.119
might consider okay we might have to

2503.119 --> 2508.0
give him this so he kind of stops doing

2505.119 --> 2510.7200000000003
that right that's like the best you can

2508.0 --> 2510.72
get out of it

2511.839 --> 2517.52
just psychological issues you don't just

2515.119 --> 2523.1600000000003
correct for them

2517.52 --> 2523.16
with medical intervention that's idiotic

2526.96 --> 2531.04
the psychology of mayonnaise

2529.52 --> 2533.119
uh

2531.04 --> 2535.119
okay

2533.119 --> 2536.4
what mayonnaise has a lot of good fat in

2535.119 --> 2538.7200000000003
them

2536.4 --> 2540.56
your brain needs a lot of good fat to

2538.72 --> 2543.359
function properly if you deprive

2540.56 --> 2545.2
yourself of fats

2543.359 --> 2547.5989999999997
then your brain

2545.2 --> 2549.04
will stall start to falter you will lose

2547.599 --> 2550.56
concentration

2549.04 --> 2552.4
you will be more inclined to get

2550.56 --> 2554.96
headaches

2552.4 --> 2554.96
so yeah

2559.04 --> 2563.359
see how i can do that

2561.2 --> 2564.64
every time somebody makes a joke i just

2563.359 --> 2567.52
immediately

2564.64 --> 2569.68
give you a full in detail

2567.52 --> 2572.48
information rich

2569.68 --> 2574.24
applicable response that you can use for

2572.48 --> 2576.2400000000002
your life isn't that just amazing you

2574.24 --> 2579.72
think you had a joke i just gave you

2576.24 --> 2579.72
serious information

2582.079 --> 2584.48
anyway

2587.119 --> 2592.4
hey that flat fellow thanks for the 99

2589.44 --> 2594.64
cent super chat

2592.4 --> 2596.8
ah that flat goes yeah they they don't

2594.64 --> 2599.359
have a sphere at horizon

2596.8 --> 2602.6400000000003
but it's refracted but then they can't

2599.359 --> 2602.64
do anything anymore

2603.28 --> 2607.3590000000004
that that's where they literally lose

2605.119 --> 2608.88
oversight right terrestrial refraction

2607.359 --> 2611.359
is

2608.88 --> 2614.0
savagely complicated

2611.359 --> 2617.839
it's super unintuitive

2614.0 --> 2620.48
and it's very very easy and preferable

2617.839 --> 2623.2
on a personal level to overlook it

2620.48 --> 2624.72
because it makes everything turn to [ __ ]

2623.2 --> 2625.7599999999998
in the mechanics

2624.72 --> 2628.0789999999997
yeah

2625.76 --> 2630.6400000000003
despite that though i have a very good

2628.079 --> 2632.88
oversight in what it does

2630.64 --> 2635.5989999999997
and then all the balls said no no no it

2632.88 --> 2638.4
doesn't do that no oh we can still oh dr

2635.599 --> 2640.0
phil yesterday oh it's insignificant oh

2638.4 --> 2642.079
no it isn't

2640.0 --> 2643.2
ball earth is not gonna look like a ball

2642.079 --> 2645.28
anymore

2643.2 --> 2649.839
if terrestrial refraction is real right

2645.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
i don't overlook those things

2652.24 --> 2656.319
basically mayonnaise makes you smarter

2654.319 --> 2658.8
no no it doesn't

2656.319 --> 2663.839
but it allows you to

2658.8 --> 2663.8390000000004
utilize your faculties more efficiently

2679.04 --> 2681.7599999999998
that's what happened to on the flood

2680.4 --> 2683.44
earth oh

2681.76 --> 2688.079
so smart

2683.44 --> 2690.079
you're so smart devin bo you're so smart

2688.079 --> 2691.44
damn you came up with that all on your

2690.079 --> 2694.8390000000004
own

2691.44 --> 2694.839
you're a genius

2712.48 --> 2718.04
triggered derp alert yes you can store

2714.72 --> 2718.04
water there

2718.48 --> 2726.319
they've sent in the clowns

2722.51 --> 2728.079
[Music]

2726.319 --> 2731.319
send in

2728.079 --> 2731.319
the clowns

2742.24 --> 2748.0
did you ever get your own marinade

2746.8 --> 2751.44
well

2748.0 --> 2754.079
yeah my mother used to make it

2751.44 --> 2755.04
but i yeah at the time i didn't really

2754.079 --> 2756.7200000000003
like it

2755.04 --> 2758.56
i was like yeah

2756.72 --> 2763.04
i i want

2758.56 --> 2764.72
fritz house is that terrible

2763.04 --> 2766.48
like and that stuff was actually

2764.72 --> 2769.2
terrible for me i wouldn't even like get

2766.48 --> 2771.2
zits and [ __ ] from freight's house but i

2769.2 --> 2772.3999999999996
liked it because i was a stupid little

2771.2 --> 2774.64
kid

2772.4 --> 2778.56
if i get like homemade mayonnaise right

2774.64 --> 2778.56
now i'd probably find it amazing

2779.599 --> 2783.119
but it's been yeah well

2784.56 --> 2788.7599999999998
almost 20 years at least

2790.8 --> 2794.96
wish the rain would stop yeah me too

2792.48 --> 2797.92
service day i like i went for groceries

2794.96 --> 2800.88
and then got completely doused

2797.92 --> 2800.88
super annoying

2805.599 --> 2809.3590000000004
right and i can't take with me my

2807.359 --> 2811.2799999999997
umbrella because there's also that

2809.359 --> 2813.839
stupid storm so you can't use the

2811.28 --> 2815.3590000000004
umbrella it's just very annoying like

2813.839 --> 2819.2799999999997
this is one of those times where i'm

2815.359 --> 2819.2799999999997
like really sorry i don't have a car

2821.119 --> 2824.359
oh well

2839.68 --> 2843.9199999999996
this is my favorite flat earth

2841.44 --> 2849.2400000000002
mayonnaise channel dude i'll show you my

2843.92 --> 2849.2400000000002
madness i'll show you my man names

2873.37 --> 2876.5
[Music]

2883.2 --> 2889.2
mayonnaise there you go

2886.319 --> 2890.4
isn't that amazing

2889.2 --> 2892.16
it's just

2890.4 --> 2894.559
it just really looks like basic

2892.16 --> 2896.72
mayonnaise

2894.559 --> 2898.96
right

2896.72 --> 2898.9599999999996
just

2899.2 --> 2903.1189999999997
typical

2901.119 --> 2904.88
it's almost like custardy at the start

2903.119 --> 2907.839
but it does get a little bit more fluid

2904.88 --> 2907.839
as time passes

2910.48 --> 2915.28
i love that stuff

2912.72 --> 2918.48
full and creamy

2915.28 --> 2921.76
because there's also like oh fresh

2918.48 --> 2925.7
different no but i like the maximum fat

2921.76 --> 2927.3590000000004
my marinade has to be maximum fat

2925.7 --> 2930.24
[Music]

2927.359 --> 2930.24
and then it's great

2931.44 --> 2938.079
mayonnaise is ready

2934.64 --> 2941.04
it's a great staple food i love it

2938.079 --> 2942.4
i literally eat it on everything almost

2941.04 --> 2945.4
everything

2942.4 --> 2945.4
so

2973.52 --> 2976.559
i mean literally everything would be

2975.28 --> 2978.96
kind of nutty

2976.559 --> 2980.3190000000004
don't take mayonnaise on my pizza for

2978.96 --> 2981.44
example

2980.319 --> 2983.52
right

2981.44 --> 2985.2000000000003
but

2983.52 --> 2987.44
anyway

2985.2 --> 2989.839
this show has been sponsored by ako play

2987.44 --> 2991.28
if they want to i'd love to sponsor i

2989.839 --> 2993.7599999999998
don't even

2991.28 --> 2995.3590000000004
i don't even need money from them

2993.76 --> 2998.4
for it

2995.359 --> 3000.88
i just really like their store chain

2998.4 --> 3002.88
i want them to thrive i want them to not

3000.88 --> 3004.96
get more expensive

3002.88 --> 3009.04
so i'll give them any advertisement they

3004.96 --> 3009.04
they like if they actually want that

3009.44 --> 3013.4
throw me i don't know

3025.28 --> 3028.4
oh wow

3028.96 --> 3032.0
you're so special

3036.559 --> 3041.559
what is the main oil i think olive oil

3043.44 --> 3047.319
i didn't read

3055.68 --> 3059.359
crack black pepper

3057.68 --> 3060.7999999999997
could be interesting yeah dude there's

3059.359 --> 3062.88
all kinds of things you could if you

3060.8 --> 3064.319
don't just want the marinade just like

3062.88 --> 3066.4
that

3064.319 --> 3070.16
right you can make special barbecue

3066.4 --> 3071.76
sauce for example by mixing in ketchup

3070.16 --> 3074.64
good ketchup

3071.76 --> 3074.6400000000003
and a little

3076.48 --> 3078.96
ginger

3077.44 --> 3081.68
like ginger

3078.96 --> 3083.44
not just pure ginger but like the ginger

3081.68 --> 3087.359
syrup

3083.44 --> 3087.359
a little this delicious

3089.52 --> 3092.52
right

3109.52 --> 3114.24
how it went from psychology versus

3111.599 --> 3117.28
psychiatry to mayonnaise

3114.24 --> 3119.7599999999998
oh mayonnaise is my

3117.28 --> 3122.559
is like a universal solution i even

3119.76 --> 3124.6400000000003
explained it right the brain needs fats

3122.559 --> 3127.0400000000004
to properly function now we live in a

3124.64 --> 3130.24
world where basically a bunch of bloaty

3127.04 --> 3134.16
people think oh i i'm too fat

3130.24 --> 3138.4799999999996
that means i must stop eating fat

3134.16 --> 3139.7599999999998
look the ads say that smart yeah it

3138.48 --> 3141.839
isn't

3139.76 --> 3143.599
you actually need the fat you need good

3141.839 --> 3145.839
fat you need healthy fat and hey if you

3143.599 --> 3148.079
got good organic mayonnaise

3145.839 --> 3150.64
that's good fat your body uses that

3148.079 --> 3153.3590000000004
right why are you fat it's not because

3150.64 --> 3156.96
you have surplus of fat that the body

3153.359 --> 3160.48
doesn't know anything to do with it

3156.96 --> 3163.68
it's there because it's storing poison

3160.48 --> 3164.96
that usually comes with bad fat

3163.68 --> 3165.7599999999998
bad fat

3164.96 --> 3168.4
are

3165.76 --> 3170.7200000000003
like rife with all kinds of toxic [ __ ]

3168.4 --> 3172.64
that dissolves in fat and then you

3170.72 --> 3173.9199999999996
absorb that and then your body doesn't

3172.64 --> 3176.48
know what to do with it it can't

3173.92 --> 3178.7200000000003
actually use the fat because it's needed

3176.48 --> 3181.44
to actually contain the poison so it

3178.72 --> 3182.3999999999996
then just heaps it up and then you blow

3181.44 --> 3185.92
it up

3182.4 --> 3188.8
right so you need good fat you need

3185.92 --> 3190.079
clean good fat to actually get rid of

3188.8 --> 3193.44
the fat

3190.079 --> 3196.8
right and when you do that you not only

3193.44 --> 3199.52
slink down a little you also smarten up

3196.8 --> 3201.6800000000003
right because all that fat is also not

3199.52 --> 3204.16
then in your brain when it's

3201.68 --> 3206.0789999999997
containing poison in your body

3204.16 --> 3209.72
right

3206.079 --> 3209.7200000000003
it's just a fact

3211.44 --> 3215.44
no mayonnaise is not my password

3218.48 --> 3222.96
nobody's ever gonna guess

3220.839 --> 3228.04
that you won't

3222.96 --> 3228.04
you you literally will not be able to

3238.079 --> 3241.3590000000004
anyway

3239.119 --> 3241.359
uh

3243.599 --> 3247.76
right so yeah as a if somebody actually

3246.319 --> 3249.52
comes to me and says like i have

3247.76 --> 3251.92
psychological problems i'm ready to

3249.52 --> 3253.92
admit that i have

3251.92 --> 3255.359
then i'll be challenging them saying

3253.92 --> 3258.0
like oh really

3255.359 --> 3260.96
so you will you be

3258.0 --> 3263.68
be actually willing to do

3260.96 --> 3265.92
what it really takes

3263.68 --> 3268.0789999999997
right because that means i'm going to

3265.92 --> 3270.559
first address what you eat that's where

3268.079 --> 3273.2000000000003
i start somebody actually came to me for

3270.559 --> 3275.6800000000003
psychological help

3273.2 --> 3278.48
first thing i start is diet what are you

3275.68 --> 3279.839
eating

3278.48 --> 3281.04
and then

3279.839 --> 3283.68
second

3281.04 --> 3286.5589999999997
what is your social life like what what

3283.68 --> 3289.5989999999997
people do you hang around with

3286.559 --> 3292.48
what do you get out of it right

3289.599 --> 3294.7200000000003
first get the food right right then they

3292.48 --> 3298.559
might yeah first is diet

3294.72 --> 3298.5589999999997
that takes some time to get used to that

3298.96 --> 3304.079
then the consequences right

3302.0 --> 3306.48
then they have to really fully start to

3304.079 --> 3308.2400000000002
understand that everything they do is

3306.48 --> 3310.4
interlinked and that usually they have

3308.24 --> 3312.0
bad habits because other people have had

3310.4 --> 3314.96
bad habits

3312.0 --> 3316.96
that they they don't want to let go

3314.96 --> 3318.4
those people not even the habits it's

3316.96 --> 3320.64
just the people that come with them and

3318.4 --> 3322.0
then that's where the real psychology

3320.64 --> 3323.68
starts

3322.0 --> 3327.44
first have to become bodily

3323.68 --> 3329.9199999999996
self-sufficient restorable then

3327.44 --> 3331.92
take care of everything else that is in

3329.92 --> 3333.839
your life

3331.92 --> 3335.92
what are you doing why what are you

3333.839 --> 3338.64
getting out of it

3335.92 --> 3339.839
is this good for you

3338.64 --> 3343.2799999999997
manage

3339.839 --> 3347.24
actual management of their life

3343.28 --> 3347.2400000000002
but it starts with food

3353.92 --> 3358.88
all that fat that people have extra

3356.079 --> 3361.92
stored is essentially excess and

3358.88 --> 3364.88
unused no it isn't flatter sage

3361.92 --> 3368.079
it isn't it's polluted

3364.88 --> 3370.319
if it was accessible

3368.079 --> 3374.4
then it would be used the body can use

3370.319 --> 3377.7599999999998
fat in many many ways

3374.4 --> 3381.76
it does it's not just oh they have too

3377.76 --> 3383.2000000000003
much of it no it's poisoned

3381.76 --> 3385.8390000000004
it's there

3383.2 --> 3388.319
building up because it's storage

3385.839 --> 3390.88
of toxins that are in the fat it's

3388.319 --> 3393.599
polluted that's why it stays there

3390.88 --> 3397.52
that's why it don't don't just

3393.599 --> 3399.04
gets absorbed on a cellular level

3397.52 --> 3401.119
by your organs

3399.04 --> 3403.68
by your liver by your brain

3401.119 --> 3406.1600000000003
dude your liver and your brain use a lot

3403.68 --> 3406.16
of fat

3408.52 --> 3411.63
[Music]

3415.359 --> 3419.5989999999997
right when you see really bloaty people

3417.92 --> 3422.2400000000002
they're not blow to be hot because they

3419.599 --> 3424.6400000000003
have too much fat they're bloaty

3422.24 --> 3428.799
because they have too much poison

3424.64 --> 3428.799
that is being stored in fat

3430.16 --> 3435.92
trust me on this i've been saying that

3431.76 --> 3435.92
for over 20 years and it's true

3436.64 --> 3440.319
it is true it works

3439.359 --> 3443.5989999999997
it's like

3440.319 --> 3445.68
scientifically provable that that's true

3443.599 --> 3448.079
you could literally test it out on a

3445.68 --> 3454.2799999999997
massive scale and it'll work every

3448.079 --> 3454.28
single time it will it really will work

3465.44 --> 3470.319
right

3466.559 --> 3471.44
and i even have like family

3470.319 --> 3475.2799999999997
related

3471.44 --> 3478.0
proof of that my mother right

3475.28 --> 3481.0400000000004
we all used to eat plenty of fat and

3478.0 --> 3482.0
really healthy and organic and like

3481.04 --> 3486.799
garden

3482.0 --> 3486.799
vegetable stuff and fruits from our own

3487.04 --> 3491.7599999999998
and we were mostly very careful

3489.359 --> 3494.4
but then when my mother started to get

3491.76 --> 3496.96
like poison pharmaceutical crap

3494.4 --> 3500.4
anti-depressant allergy all kinds of

3496.96 --> 3502.64
terrible stuff and then more and more

3500.4 --> 3505.44
then she blowed it up it's not because

3502.64 --> 3509.359
oh she has too much fat no it's because

3505.44 --> 3511.76
the poison suddenly needed all that fat

3509.359 --> 3514.0789999999997
to basically prevent body from

3511.76 --> 3517.2000000000003
self-destructing

3514.079 --> 3519.44
it needed the fat for storage space

3517.2 --> 3523.1189999999997
of the poison

3519.44 --> 3525.52
because it couldn't be processed

3523.119 --> 3529.04
yeah before that before she started

3525.52 --> 3530.64
taking all that she was sleen

3529.04 --> 3532.88
she was like me

3530.64 --> 3536.0
very slim

3532.88 --> 3538.7200000000003
and then in the course of like

3536.0 --> 3540.799
between five and ten years like when she

3538.72 --> 3543.2
started taking that just immediately it

3540.799 --> 3545.119
just turned into a troll

3543.2 --> 3546.0789999999997
very quickly

3545.119 --> 3548.4
like

3546.079 --> 3549.8390000000004
every year another

3548.4 --> 3552.4
layer

3549.839 --> 3555.44
terrible it's the poison it's not the

3552.4 --> 3557.359
fat fat doesn't make you fat

3555.44 --> 3559.68
poison makes you fat

3557.359 --> 3562.799
because then your body is going to use

3559.68 --> 3566.3999999999996
fat to store the poison with so it

3562.799 --> 3569.52
doesn't actually destroy you completely

3566.4 --> 3571.44
it's the defense mechanism body

3569.52 --> 3574.72
uses fat

3571.44 --> 3577.599
as like toxic waste dump

3574.72 --> 3579.359
solution like i don't know where to do

3577.599 --> 3581.6800000000003
it it's gonna destroy everything quickly

3579.359 --> 3583.7599999999998
put it in in a toxic waste dog get some

3581.68 --> 3586.3999999999996
fat in here and then store it in there

3583.76 --> 3588.7200000000003
and just keep it keep it there

3586.4 --> 3591.92
right until we could deal with this

3588.72 --> 3594.72
that's what that is it's not the fat

3591.92 --> 3596.64
it's the poison in the fat

3594.72 --> 3598.8799999999997
that's keeping you fat

3596.64 --> 3601.359
and that's why people that are bloaty

3598.88 --> 3603.599
that then go on a rigorous training

3601.359 --> 3606.72
course to lose that fat that's why they

3603.599 --> 3608.799
get heart attacks because then

3606.72 --> 3611.2
it forces the body to actually burn it

3608.799 --> 3613.68
off and release all that poison again

3611.2 --> 3617.2
and then you get a heart attack

3613.68 --> 3617.2
that's how that happens

3619.359 --> 3621.7599999999998
right

3626.319 --> 3631.44
the solution is good fats always always

3630.079 --> 3635.52
good fats

3631.44 --> 3635.52
good fats solve a lot of problems

3637.839 --> 3644.5589999999997
yeah but you see oh autopilot george

3642.4 --> 3646.079
burning fat

3644.559 --> 3648.559
is a

3646.079 --> 3650.559
modern myth

3648.559 --> 3654.2400000000002
it doesn't help

3650.559 --> 3655.76
burn fat is cosmetic it's stupid it's

3654.24 --> 3658.24
the poison

3655.76 --> 3660.7200000000003
the poison is the problem not the fat

3658.24 --> 3663.359
the poison is the problem not the fat if

3660.72 --> 3666.319
you burn the fat you release the poison

3663.359 --> 3668.88
you become poison

3666.319 --> 3671.359
the only way you deal with it is by

3668.88 --> 3674.079
stopping the poisoning

3671.359 --> 3677.2799999999997
eating good fats and then

3674.079 --> 3681.599
then it will start to go away because

3677.28 --> 3681.599
the poison can now be taken care of

3682.72 --> 3686.9599999999996
that's how it works

3684.4 --> 3689.04
you don't burn fat to lose weight that's

3686.96 --> 3690.48
how you poison yourself

3689.04 --> 3694.24
because you if you're fat you're

3690.48 --> 3694.2400000000002
probably fat for a good reason

3696.48 --> 3700.48
right and now i'm oversimplifying things

3698.799 --> 3704.16
a little but it

3700.48 --> 3708.4
universally this is a really good system

3704.16 --> 3710.72
to think about it like this it does work

3708.4 --> 3714.799
what's your take on fasting it's great

3710.72 --> 3714.799
fasting is really good for metabolics

3716.079 --> 3719.92
right because it gives your

3718.4 --> 3722.559
every time you eat

3719.92 --> 3724.0
your body's system is set in a certain

3722.559 --> 3727.3590000000004
way

3724.0 --> 3729.68
you have less ability to regenerate to

3727.359 --> 3732.24
restore things when

3729.68 --> 3734.64
your body is in that mode so completely

3732.24 --> 3737.2799999999997
not eating for a while

3734.64 --> 3739.2799999999997
gives your body the full focus it needs

3737.28 --> 3742.0
to actually deal with some issues that

3739.28 --> 3744.4
it won't be able to without it

3742.0 --> 3747.119
that's why fasting can be great very

3744.4 --> 3748.88
good habit within like the

3747.119 --> 3750.48
mormon religion too

3748.88 --> 3752.96
