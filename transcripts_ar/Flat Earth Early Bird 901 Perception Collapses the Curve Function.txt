the weather today is

113.2 --> 120.24000000000001
not as stormy well it is stormy still

117.28 --> 123.28
i guess it's been pretty much storming

120.24 --> 123.28
24 hours

123.759 --> 129.679
all night especially like

126.799 --> 130.239
late at night after two and all that it

129.679 --> 132.72
was like

130.239 --> 135.20000000000002
really storming hard it's also been

132.72 --> 135.2
raining

135.28 --> 140.72
better part of the morning it's still

138.4 --> 145.84
very clouded up there

140.72 --> 145.84
yeah no no clear spots to be seen

149.12 --> 152.56
so yeah it just seems like this gonna be

152.319 --> 156.07999999999998
a

152.56 --> 158.64000000000001
uh a wet and stormy restless

156.08 --> 158.64000000000001
saturday

161.92 --> 164.97
[Applause]

167.519 --> 178.87900000000002
so it is the 22nd of may 2021

174.0 --> 182.239
and yeah my youtube is acting weird

178.879 --> 185.76
again i thought i changed browsers

182.239 --> 187.28
to watch it but it's still doing the

185.76 --> 190.319
same thing as it is yesterday

187.28 --> 190.319
just constantly

190.4 --> 196.64000000000001
blinking i watched it back

194.159 --> 198.959
my show from yesterday and yeah the

196.64 --> 201.67999999999998
recording isn't blinking so for some

198.959 --> 204.31900000000002
reason it's just the

201.68 --> 205.92000000000002
the live interface on my side i don't

204.319 --> 209.11999999999998
know why it's doing that

205.92 --> 209.11999999999998
it's very distracting

209.92 --> 214.07999999999998
anyway let's see who's in chat bobby

212.48 --> 218.319
stills first

214.08 --> 227.84
dutch sailor terret 306 here we go again

218.319 --> 227.83999999999997
good to see you all on this saturday

228.72 --> 241.84
how are you all doing

262.0 --> 265.759
not much to do outside today

267.6 --> 271.52000000000004
but i could think of plenty to do

269.52 --> 272.15999999999997
outside but yeah it's not the best of

271.52 --> 276.08
weather

272.16 --> 279.28000000000003
so back after a long time

276.08 --> 282.96
is it so hmm

279.28 --> 285.52
all right welcome back tara 306.

282.96 --> 285.52
green tea

286.4 --> 289.919
very minimal today compared to yesterday

289.36 --> 297.84000000000003
yes i

289.919 --> 297.84
watched it here we go again

300.639 --> 304.479
yeah by the way here we go again the our

303.84 --> 306.79999999999995
skype

304.479 --> 308.88
feed for some there's something weird

306.8 --> 312.72
about it

308.88 --> 314.639
uh for some reason you are able to send

312.72 --> 315.91900000000004
me links and i've been able to send you

314.639 --> 319.199
links and

315.919 --> 321.35999999999996
but it still says you haven't you like

319.199 --> 324.88
we officially haven't contacted yet you

321.36 --> 329.12
haven't accepted the invitation

324.88 --> 329.12
that's what skype says

332.16 --> 339.84000000000003
it's weird don't know if you know

334.24 --> 339.84000000000003
anything about that

340.479 --> 346.15999999999997
you love her okay yeah syrian girl yes

342.88 --> 346.15999999999997
here and go it's interesting

346.639 --> 353.84000000000003
been i've took notice of her through

349.84 --> 353.84
like the alex jones show

355.36 --> 363.039
yeah several interviews between

358.479 --> 363.039
paul joseph watson and cereal syrian

364.84 --> 369.44
girl

366.24 --> 372.88
yeah because she kind of got

369.44 --> 376.8
some attention since the whole

372.88 --> 381.84
situation with syria started to

376.8 --> 381.84000000000003
get global

382.479 --> 386.88
that's been happening for over a decade

384.639 --> 386.88
so

392.84 --> 396.23999999999995
huh right

399.36 --> 404.88
so yeah this is the video she

402.4 --> 404.88
sent me

405.52 --> 411.19899999999996
not gonna talk about it i already get

408.4 --> 411.19899999999996
the gist of it

413.039 --> 415.919
so anyway

416.479 --> 424.31899999999996
i'm pretty much open to discuss

419.759 --> 424.319
whatever in this hour show

427.039 --> 432.88
i put in a title to continue the theme

430.0 --> 432.88
from yesterday

433.12 --> 437.84000000000003
perception collapses the curve function

442.639 --> 452.40000000000003
inspired on the locally flat theory

450.08 --> 453.28
so i could elaborate on that if you guys

452.4 --> 457.039
are interested

453.28 --> 457.039
or we can talk about other things

463.52 --> 465.84
all right

467.199 --> 470.8
yesterday flat earth debates was pretty

470.24 --> 474.16
good

470.8 --> 475.28000000000003
long after show an hour and i was very

474.16 --> 479.28000000000003
active in it

475.28 --> 481.84
so interested to hear that back on this

479.28 --> 481.84
sunday

482.24 --> 491.52
in the premieres glove perspective

486.96 --> 493.039
yeah terra 306. owen benjamin also live

491.52 --> 496.71999999999997
had a whole piece

493.039 --> 498.639
on his interaction with gammas

496.72 --> 501.759
it was interesting because hey i deal

498.639 --> 505.759
with that in my own way

501.759 --> 509.039
on my show and yeah he

505.759 --> 512.159
really went rolling onto that

509.039 --> 516.24
like his the bear gammas

512.159 --> 516.24
i've been following him around and [ __ ]

517.2 --> 521.599
like the social media stalking them and

520.959 --> 523.919
all that

521.599 --> 523.9190000000001
him

527.839 --> 531.839
then later in the evening continued

530.32 --> 535.6
watching the predators

531.839 --> 540.1600000000001
2 movie and ended up with the

535.6 --> 540.16
much later made predators

540.72 --> 543.519
which is like

544.88 --> 549.76
kind of like a hybrid remake

548.0 --> 551.68
slash continuation now it is a

549.76 --> 554.8
continuation technically

551.68 --> 555.279
to the original predator one movie and

554.8 --> 557.5999999999999
it's

555.279 --> 560.399
made very decent like they completely

557.6 --> 564.08
kept the musical theme in there

560.399 --> 564.56
minimal changes and yeah the actors in

564.08 --> 566.64
there

564.56 --> 567.92
did a pretty good job like the entire

566.64 --> 571.12
setting of the movie

567.92 --> 574.0799999999999
is really different

571.12 --> 574.08
from the first two

574.839 --> 577.839
and

579.04 --> 584.64
yeah it still leaves more wanting though

582.399 --> 587.68
like i've even been thinking in my head

584.64 --> 590.88
like what would be an actual good

587.68 --> 594.0799999999999
third predator movie that would be

590.88 --> 595.68
like really in the build up line of the

594.08 --> 598.1600000000001
first two

595.68 --> 600.0799999999999
like how could you do that and even been

598.16 --> 601.68
thinking like how awesome would it be if

600.08 --> 604.0790000000001
like

601.68 --> 605.8389999999999
it's tough to think up a good story

604.079 --> 607.519
about it how could you get the main

605.839 --> 610.0
characters from predator one

607.519 --> 611.2
and two arnold schwarzenegger survivor

610.0 --> 613.92
and the police

611.2 --> 616.5600000000001
guy from predator 2 how could you get

613.92 --> 617.76
these legends together like afterward in

616.56 --> 620.8
some

617.76 --> 622.16
viable setup to deal with a predator

620.8 --> 624.399
again

622.16 --> 626.079
without it seeming too forced which is

624.399 --> 628.56
kind of what it would be

626.079 --> 629.92
right and these two guys will definitely

628.56 --> 633.5999999999999
try to avoid

629.92 --> 635.4399999999999
contact overall after their experience

633.6 --> 637.44
because yeah encountering predator is

635.44 --> 640.0790000000001
pretty

637.44 --> 642.24
horrific savage bound to have some

640.079 --> 644.4799999999999
post-traumatic stress syndrome effects

642.24 --> 646.24
on you

644.48 --> 648.0
but i've just been thinking about it

646.24 --> 650.64
because i really like

648.0 --> 653.519
the story concept it's real it's

650.64 --> 656.56
something else it's really

653.519 --> 659.519
interesting because it's the way

656.56 --> 660.2399999999999
they constructed the fear element into

659.519 --> 662.72
it like that

660.24 --> 665.04
they really everything is about tension

662.72 --> 668.24
building in these movies

665.04 --> 671.4399999999999
there is horror in it as well and gore

668.24 --> 673.76
but it's always been arranged in a

671.44 --> 677.12
certain way where it's not just like ah

673.76 --> 681.6
look at all the disgusting [ __ ] too much

677.12 --> 684.9590000000001
right it's like yeah it's just

681.6 --> 684.9590000000001
designed in a way that's

685.279 --> 689.12
that really works for movie making

687.44 --> 692.32
anyway

689.12 --> 696.72
enough about that hey sleeping warrior

692.32 --> 696.72
welcome to the show agm

699.2 --> 703.839
color perspective

705.36 --> 711.12
knowledge of the geometric horizon

707.279 --> 711.12
distance collapses the curve function

713.519 --> 716.88
it's not even knowledge in this case

715.36 --> 719.279
it's perception

716.88 --> 721.76
right knowing the which path that's what

719.279 --> 724.959
the idea was based on

721.76 --> 728.72
but it's actually just

724.959 --> 732.88
applying measurement sensory

728.72 --> 736.0
if you apply sensory start to measure

732.88 --> 738.8
anything about the earth's surface

736.0 --> 739.519
then the wave the curve function will

738.8 --> 742.8
collapse

739.519 --> 742.8
that's the idea behind it

743.36 --> 759.839
so it's actually more radical than the

745.36 --> 759.839
knowing which path experiment

770.839 --> 773.839
hmm

784.839 --> 787.839
oh

798.88 --> 815.8389999999999
blur fists what

826.839 --> 829.839
mm-hmm

853.519 --> 858.88
so any more input guys

857.12 --> 861.279
i'm getting really distracted by the

858.88 --> 863.8389999999999
blinking on my own youtube

861.279 --> 863.8389999999999
output

864.48 --> 867.279
blur first

867.6 --> 871.839
or what about him

888.399 --> 892.24
you want to come on or something tony

894.32 --> 899.839
i think i'd i'd personally appreciate it

896.56 --> 899.8389999999999
to get somebody on the show

902.0 --> 913.839
bluffing blurbs yeah

938.839 --> 947.1990000000001
hello hello anybody hearing me

943.12 --> 947.199
i'm addressing you in chat right now

948.56 --> 955.8389999999999
sleeping warrior

958.56 --> 962.16
yes or no will suffice

965.44 --> 968.639
it's nice that if people come into my

967.68 --> 972.88
chat that they'd

968.639 --> 974.72
actually respond when i address them

972.88 --> 983.8389999999999
that would be great would make for a

974.72 --> 983.839
much more fluid show

986.8 --> 990.959
yes dutch sailor now i wasn't addressing

989.92 --> 997.8389999999999
you specifically

990.959 --> 997.8389999999999
it's okay

1009.6 --> 1015.519
right anyway yeah the

1013.04 --> 1016.56
vacation money thing finally came in for

1015.519 --> 1019.759
me so i

1016.56 --> 1020.3199999999999
basically quickly managed to pay off

1019.759 --> 1023.279
debts

1020.32 --> 1025.839
and did a special telephone call to

1023.279 --> 1025.839
really like

1026.16 --> 1030.24
like relay it with the company

1030.4 --> 1038.24
in order yeah to ensure that i got it

1034.4 --> 1041.039
and yeah i even managed to avoid

1038.24 --> 1044.64
the yeah the penalties and all that so

1041.039 --> 1044.64
that's they're feeling good about it

1046.959 --> 1050.96
just a few more things to do and i'm

1048.88 --> 1053.0390000000002
done

1050.96 --> 1054.08
and i think that well thanks to that

1053.039 --> 1057.52
large donation

1054.08 --> 1060.559
from will williams earlier

1057.52 --> 1063.52
that yeah i'm not just gonna run to the

1060.559 --> 1066.559
zero point again so

1063.52 --> 1068.559
i'm gonna carefully consider what i'm

1066.559 --> 1072.96
gonna do with the surplus

1068.559 --> 1074.8799999999999
i'm just gonna like keep it as a backup

1072.96 --> 1076.96
or if there's like some things that i

1074.88 --> 1079.3600000000001
really need to get

1076.96 --> 1081.28
that i've kind of put so far in the back

1079.36 --> 1082.24
of my mind that i kind of forgot about

1081.28 --> 1084.799
it

1082.24 --> 1089.039
because yeah when you don't have a lot

1084.799 --> 1091.44
of money or any money to really invest

1089.039 --> 1094.24
then i typically just try to forget

1091.44 --> 1096.48
about it otherwise just gonna nag

1094.24 --> 1096.48
me

1100.64 --> 1109.8400000000001
so yeah things are good like that

1122.08 --> 1126.08
playing in the garage okay

1126.64 --> 1132.3200000000002
all right sleeping warrior

1129.76 --> 1132.32
that's fine

1134.0 --> 1137.84
all right

1150.24 --> 1156.4
all right yeah paul joseph watson had a

1153.919 --> 1158.24
a funny well funny it's always tough to

1156.4 --> 1161.679
just call it funny

1158.24 --> 1161.679
a video yesterday

1162.64 --> 1167.2800000000002
definitely not a cult that's what it's

1164.64 --> 1168.3200000000002
called i posted it in the early word

1167.28 --> 1172.48
chat

1168.32 --> 1174.3999999999999
and skype and also in masterpiece

1172.48 --> 1177.52
definitely worth watching and then

1174.4 --> 1181.2800000000002
thinking about it like

1177.52 --> 1183.52
this is just the very overt part

1181.28 --> 1183.52
but

1184.32 --> 1190.8799999999999
it's not the only place where there is

1187.919 --> 1192.4
cult formation it seems like it's really

1190.88 --> 1194.7990000000002
of the times now

1192.4 --> 1197.2800000000002
due to the massive amount of overall

1194.799 --> 1202.32
indoctrination misleading

1197.28 --> 1206.1589999999999
things no logos encouraging culture

1202.32 --> 1207.9189999999999
that a lot of people have or more people

1206.159 --> 1209.8400000000001
otherwise they wouldn't even be trying

1207.919 --> 1215.2
it are susceptible

1209.84 --> 1215.1999999999998
to cult hierarchy

1216.96 --> 1221.1200000000001
it only makes sense right if you take

1218.88 --> 1223.8400000000001
everybody's

1221.12 --> 1225.1999999999998
foundations away their family spiritual

1223.84 --> 1227.76
foundations

1225.2 --> 1228.48
and just throw them just cookie cutter

1227.76 --> 1232.96
corporate

1228.48 --> 1234.96
[ __ ] and basically hand them the tools

1232.96 --> 1238.159
only to be manipulated

1234.96 --> 1242.4
yeah a lot of people are gonna end up

1238.159 --> 1245.679
just conforming to some kind of a cult

1242.4 --> 1245.679
that they get obsessed with

1245.919 --> 1249.3600000000001
so it makes sense that there is indeed

1248.559 --> 1252.1589999999999
just

1249.36 --> 1253.6
corporate top-down political top-down

1252.159 --> 1256.88
cult formation

1253.6 --> 1257.9189999999999
happening and yeah paul joseph watson

1256.88 --> 1260.7990000000002
made a video

1257.919 --> 1261.44
about that addressing that in a comedic

1260.799 --> 1265.84
setup

1261.44 --> 1267.8400000000001
as he typically does i think it's

1265.84 --> 1268.9599999999998
one of those videos that are well worth

1267.84 --> 1271.9189999999999
spreading

1268.96 --> 1273.679
like even to people that wouldn't

1271.919 --> 1278.159
normally like that

1273.679 --> 1278.159
because yeah in that video it's

1278.48 --> 1285.3600000000001
it's it's very in your face

1282.24 --> 1285.36
how bad it's gotten

1288.84 --> 1292.8799999999999
uh

1290.48 --> 1294.559
we had jensen talking about flat earth

1292.88 --> 1305.8400000000001
with adam curry oh my god

1294.559 --> 1305.84
really huh

1313.039 --> 1316.799
all right but that's interesting

1317.2 --> 1321.6000000000001
well what about flat earth that they

1319.039 --> 1321.6
talk about

1325.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
dutch sailor that is interesting

1336.96 --> 1340.0
please elaborate

1341.36 --> 1347.84
or link me up

1344.4 --> 1347.8400000000001
you got a wrench

1360.32 --> 1364.24
that some things could not add up oh

1362.559 --> 1367.2
really so they talked about that there

1364.24 --> 1367.2
is no curvature

1373.2 --> 1378.64
or was that not their direct conclusion

1375.52 --> 1380.799
is that your conclusion right

1378.64 --> 1382.72
when i inquire about what somebody else

1380.799 --> 1385.76
is doing it would be very good to

1382.72 --> 1389.039
keep that separated

1385.76 --> 1390.0
your response to it and the actual

1389.039 --> 1391.919
things they say

1390.0 --> 1393.919
right if you're gonna inform somebody

1391.919 --> 1396.0
about something new

1393.919 --> 1403.8400000000001
don't know if you're already doing that

1396.0 --> 1403.84
just giving you some tips

1422.08 --> 1425.279
all right i'm just scrolling through the

1423.76 --> 1428.84
comment section there

1425.279 --> 1430.799
some of it is english and most of it is

1428.84 --> 1432.6399999999999
dutch

1430.799 --> 1435.279
there's a couple of comments that seems

1432.64 --> 1435.279
to address

1435.84 --> 1441.84
the the earth situation

1439.36 --> 1443.4399999999998
details about the model that's

1441.84 --> 1445.84
interesting

1443.44 --> 1445.8400000000001
most

1450.4 --> 1456.24
quite a lot actually a lot of it is also

1453.919 --> 1456.24
about

1457.6 --> 1459.84
uh

1463.039 --> 1466.799
cove it and all that although

1467.679 --> 1475.919
wow what what's

1470.96 --> 1475.919
this his own website that's interesting

1477.76 --> 1487.84
i might actually keep a link to this

1512.799 --> 1518.08
they were a bit funny about it adam said

1515.52 --> 1520.6399999999999
it's flat

1518.08 --> 1520.6399999999999
and then

1521.919 --> 1529.8400000000001
what's funny about that

1554.84 --> 1557.84
so

1574.4 --> 1576.72
hmm

1583.279 --> 1599.84
hey michael khan no virus today no no

1586.08 --> 1599.84
virus ever

1605.44 --> 1608.96
okay dutch sailor thanks

1610.159 --> 1613.8400000000001
i i guess i'll check it out you know to

1612.64 --> 1616.0
me

1613.84 --> 1618.24
these days it's even a little difficult

1616.0 --> 1618.24
to

1618.72 --> 1623.1200000000001
to understand like how the dutch overall

1621.279 --> 1626.96
even talk about is because

1623.12 --> 1628.2399999999998
i talk very little about covet and all

1626.96 --> 1632.32
that and mind control

1628.24 --> 1635.039
in dutch it's like very rare moments

1632.32 --> 1636.1589999999999
that i even now have the opportunity to

1635.039 --> 1638.08
do this

1636.159 --> 1641.8400000000001
i used to do it a little bit more like

1638.08 --> 1641.84
say a few years back

1642.88 --> 1646.96
about flat earth and other things

1647.52 --> 1652.1589999999999
i rarely do it so i don't really know

1650.159 --> 1654.3200000000002
how much it has evolved

1652.159 --> 1655.2
because i rarely see dutch people

1654.32 --> 1657.12
talking about it

1655.2 --> 1659.6000000000001
in dutch you know most of it is just

1657.12 --> 1659.6
english

1660.88 --> 1664.0
i do know that the dutch are talking

1663.44 --> 1666.799
about it

1664.0 --> 1668.799
it's just like how do they do that like

1666.799 --> 1671.52
how are they doing it

1668.799 --> 1673.36
is it is it dissimilar is it very

1671.52 --> 1676.32
similar to the way the english talk

1673.36 --> 1676.32
about it typically

1677.44 --> 1684.559
or or are there other emphasis

1680.84 --> 1684.559
emphasis anyway

1685.12 --> 1699.6789999999999
you've been to amsterdam twice woohoo

1696.559 --> 1701.52
yeah yeah if i want to get new shoes i

1699.679 --> 1703.039
have to go to amsterdam too

1701.52 --> 1706.08
because that's where i've always bought

1703.039 --> 1709.919
my shoes from a very specific

1706.08 --> 1712.96
guy at the waterloo plain

1709.919 --> 1716.0
market i hope he's still there that

1712.96 --> 1725.8400000000001
covet hasn't just forced him to retire

1716.0 --> 1725.84
or something

1745.52 --> 1748.6399999999999
right but dutch sailor like the whole

1747.679 --> 1751.2
thing about how

1748.64 --> 1751.679
lies are in your their face and people

1751.2 --> 1754.72
don't

1751.679 --> 1757.1200000000001
see it it's because they're not

1754.72 --> 1758.72
really looking they're like sub

1757.12 --> 1761.36
listening like that this is

1758.72 --> 1765.039
my personal analysis it's surprising

1761.36 --> 1770.32
that i haven't talked about it more it's

1765.039 --> 1774.559
it's like a an autopilot mechanism

1770.32 --> 1777.84
that has really worked really well

1774.559 --> 1780.1589999999999
pretty much up until a year ago

1777.84 --> 1781.84
it's kind of like the psychological

1780.159 --> 1783.5200000000002
adaptation development

1781.84 --> 1784.8799999999999
especially in the netherlands we were

1783.52 --> 1787.36
good at it

1784.88 --> 1788.7990000000002
and how to adapt to the insanity of the

1787.36 --> 1790.9599999999998
world

1788.799 --> 1792.559
right and still manage to keep going

1790.96 --> 1795.2
well if you

1792.559 --> 1795.84
continue that on when things gotta get

1795.2 --> 1798.799
as blatant

1795.84 --> 1798.799
as now then

1798.88 --> 1802.159
it's it starts to really confuse you

1801.36 --> 1805.279
because

1802.159 --> 1807.279
the the compounding of like the errors

1805.279 --> 1809.919
even in the information presented as

1807.279 --> 1813.679
part of the gaslighting project

1809.919 --> 1817.279
it's confusing so you just

1813.679 --> 1818.24
they listen they don't really look into

1817.279 --> 1823.12
every detail

1818.24 --> 1826.32
they're just kind of like sifting for

1823.12 --> 1827.4399999999998
like cohesion in the pattern of the

1826.32 --> 1830.0
approach of it all

1827.44 --> 1832.3200000000002
constantly adapting right but since

1830.0 --> 1833.919
there are so many contradictions even

1832.32 --> 1836.72
thrown out by

1833.919 --> 1839.44
the supreme leadership of this mind

1836.72 --> 1841.76
control project

1839.44 --> 1843.76
then it becomes really confusing and

1841.76 --> 1846.0
people will be

1843.76 --> 1846.8799999999999
hearing like yeah this doesn't work and

1846.0 --> 1850.88
they'll

1846.88 --> 1852.88
think it's like a like

1850.88 --> 1854.3200000000002
there will be people in the netherlands

1852.88 --> 1856.7990000000002
too they'll

1854.32 --> 1858.1589999999999
be wearing the mask they will be told by

1856.799 --> 1861.84
their superiors or

1858.159 --> 1865.679
part of it association like yeah

1861.84 --> 1868.72
mask is actually doesn't work

1865.679 --> 1871.2
but like oh you can still wear it it'll

1868.72 --> 1873.679
make people feel safe or something

1871.2 --> 1875.279
then they'll just mix it up and forget

1873.679 --> 1878.3990000000001
that it doesn't actually work

1875.279 --> 1881.44
they'll just focus on the part that will

1878.399 --> 1881.76
work in some way and forget about the

1881.44 --> 1884.48
other

1881.76 --> 1885.919
like and i mean completely forget about

1884.48 --> 1889.279
it

1885.919 --> 1889.76
so they'll think there is just the mask

1889.279 --> 1892.64
wearing

1889.76 --> 1894.8799999999999
is more about some kind of social

1892.64 --> 1897.2
project

1894.88 --> 1899.1200000000001
a thing that's happening a dance that

1897.2 --> 1902.24
society is playing

1899.12 --> 1904.6399999999999
rather than the virus right i think that

1902.24 --> 1905.84
a lot of people even that do wear masks

1904.64 --> 1908.159
probably

1905.84 --> 1910.24
don't really believe there is a virus

1908.159 --> 1912.3990000000001
anymore

1910.24 --> 1913.679
but they'll still be doing it because

1912.399 --> 1916.1589999999999
it's part of the

1913.679 --> 1918.3990000000001
social code now it's a dance that's

1916.159 --> 1921.279
being played by society

1918.399 --> 1922.8799999999999
and dutch people are very good to adapt

1921.279 --> 1927.2
to societal

1922.88 --> 1929.8400000000001
dance plays one of yeah

1927.2 --> 1930.88
that's what dutch are really good at

1929.84 --> 1933.4399999999998
society

1930.88 --> 1934.0
it's just how we've grown i was very

1933.44 --> 1938.88
proud to

1934.0 --> 1938.88
quickly adapt to whatever's thrown at us

1940.72 --> 1944.72
so yeah dutch psychology it is a little

1944.0 --> 1949.84
different

1944.72 --> 1949.84
from a lot of other places

1954.64 --> 1959.76
get a matrix some h we don't unplug them

1956.88 --> 1959.7600000000002
because they will pop

1960.0 --> 1967.2
yeah well it's because

1963.44 --> 1967.2
when you accept lies

1967.36 --> 1970.8799999999999
integrate them in your functioning and

1970.24 --> 1972.799
into

1970.88 --> 1974.159
sizing up how you do things then

1972.799 --> 1976.6399999999999
eventually

1974.159 --> 1979.44
that'll become a crutch and you'll be

1976.64 --> 1982.88
crippled without it

1979.44 --> 1984.96
right if you just like a mistake is a

1982.88 --> 1989.0390000000002
lie

1984.96 --> 1992.08
both mistakes and lies once you accept

1989.039 --> 1995.279
the lie as truth then

1992.08 --> 1998.96
it will [ __ ] you

1995.279 --> 1998.96
even if you do it by accident

2001.36 --> 2006.32
and if you do that long enough then yeah

2004.08 --> 2009.12
that lie will literally be the crutch

2006.32 --> 2009.84
you lean on for a very long time causing

2009.12 --> 2013.1999999999998
your

2009.84 --> 2013.76
ability to just walk without it very

2013.2 --> 2016.72
tough

2013.76 --> 2019.84
and then people gets yeah basically set

2016.72 --> 2019.84
in their ways

2021.12 --> 2025.84
and even way before this even in the 90s

2024.08 --> 2027.519
i was already aware of that like very

2025.84 --> 2029.9189999999999
old people the way they've

2027.519 --> 2031.76
been taught things the way they think

2029.919 --> 2033.679
becomes very rigid

2031.76 --> 2035.519
you can't really change their minds

2033.679 --> 2037.8400000000001
they're yeah from my

2035.519 --> 2040.08
perspective from back then you can't

2037.84 --> 2042.72
really liberate their minds

2040.08 --> 2044.48
sounds so dark now i didn't know it was

2042.72 --> 2046.3990000000001
dark back then

2044.48 --> 2048.079
i already knew like yeah the old people

2046.399 --> 2050.399
they're not very flexible

2048.079 --> 2052.48
they get set in the ways of thinking and

2050.399 --> 2053.52
the feelings associated and the values

2052.48 --> 2056.399
thrown at them

2053.52 --> 2058.96
at the time that's the way they see it

2056.399 --> 2058.96
they don't

2059.52 --> 2064.079
they're not flexible anymore they don't

2061.52 --> 2066.0
want to be either

2064.079 --> 2068.32
it'll be like an offense to them that

2066.0 --> 2075.839
you try to change the way they are

2068.32 --> 2075.839
and the way they think

2082.399 --> 2086.3199999999997
so yes it does work better for young

2084.56 --> 2090.32
people

2086.32 --> 2092.7200000000003
but that doesn't mean that you can't

2090.32 --> 2093.599
partially unplug the older people as

2092.72 --> 2095.52
well

2093.599 --> 2097.2000000000003
you got to keep that in mind that just

2095.52 --> 2099.119
because they're old and would typically

2097.2 --> 2102.3199999999997
be set in their ways doesn't mean that

2099.119 --> 2105.599
they're yeah beyond

2102.32 --> 2109.44
repair beyond redemption

2105.599 --> 2112.48
right a lot of them are

2109.44 --> 2114.8
already have been

2112.48 --> 2116.2400000000002
gone going through like a long period

2114.8 --> 2119.04
like a decade

2116.24 --> 2121.2799999999997
of two decades where they've just seen

2119.04 --> 2124.4
that everything that they've

2121.28 --> 2125.44
been taught to value is being stripped

2124.4 --> 2128.8
away

2125.44 --> 2129.76
like actively the sjw [ __ ] is really

2128.8 --> 2132.0
damaging

2129.76 --> 2133.3590000000004
to a lot of old people and they won't

2132.0 --> 2135.2
even complain about it

2133.359 --> 2136.7999999999997
because they've been taught to keep it

2135.2 --> 2138.72
to themselves and let the newer

2136.8 --> 2141.599
generations figure it out

2138.72 --> 2144.16
and give them a chance to overcome the

2141.599 --> 2147.28
the struggles of their time

2144.16 --> 2150.48
but you can't play into that though

2147.28 --> 2153.76
you can actually remind them that

2150.48 --> 2156.4
yes the values you were taught

2153.76 --> 2157.76
most of them are actually better than

2156.4 --> 2160.48
what's happening now

2157.76 --> 2161.76
and that way you can break them out of

2160.48 --> 2165.119
the matrix

2161.76 --> 2167.92
by basically restoring some of their

2165.119 --> 2167.92
old spirit

2169.119 --> 2176.32
and to them that could then be

2173.119 --> 2179.52
taken perceived as like oh

2176.32 --> 2180.7200000000003
i'm actually the carrier of a good older

2179.52 --> 2183.04
flame

2180.72 --> 2184.3999999999996
i need to be the torchbearer for that i

2183.04 --> 2187.04
need to survive

2184.4 --> 2189.28
through this in order to bring through

2187.04 --> 2192.48
the older

2189.28 --> 2194.48
style information because everybody's

2192.48 --> 2196.32
being derailed from that so i need to

2194.48 --> 2197.359
keep the flame as is right that's one

2196.32 --> 2199.2000000000003
way you can

2197.359 --> 2201.119
actually get to older people and

2199.2 --> 2203.9199999999996
motivate them

2201.119 --> 2205.359
to to separate to take a stand as an

2203.92 --> 2207.359
individual

2205.359 --> 2214.0
you might be surprised how well that can

2207.359 --> 2217.52
work out

2214.0 --> 2221.28
uh nathan yeah sure i wasn't planning on

2217.52 --> 2221.28
doing a two-hour show today so

2221.44 --> 2229.839
3 p.m amsterdam time or maybe after

2240.839 --> 2243.839
great

2254.839 --> 2257.839
uh

2268.24 --> 2272.4799999999996
right but as when it comes to the

2273.119 --> 2279.2000000000003
which groups of people

2276.48 --> 2280.56
will be the easiest to awaken and which

2279.2 --> 2283.5989999999997
one will typically

2280.56 --> 2284.0
latch on to their captors it is kind of

2283.599 --> 2286.48
like

2284.0 --> 2288.079
a period in their life that has to do

2286.48 --> 2291.839
with it

2288.079 --> 2294.96
right so from what i perceive

2291.839 --> 2298.88
it's mostly people between

2294.96 --> 2302.56
20 and 40 that are getting the most

2298.88 --> 2306.48
punishment from the from the cult

2302.56 --> 2311.04
inducted death cult indoctrination

2306.48 --> 2313.44
because they are in in a time period

2311.04 --> 2315.52
where they're most vulnerable to attempt

2313.44 --> 2318.56
to adapt to society

2315.52 --> 2322.079
and where they have the most urges

2318.56 --> 2324.16
like to build like in the instinct right

2322.079 --> 2326.1600000000003
not necessarily the knowledge on how to

2324.16 --> 2327.2799999999997
actually do it or deal with it they have

2326.16 --> 2330.3199999999997
the instinct like

2327.28 --> 2333.8390000000004
especially women like kids

2330.32 --> 2335.44
need kids or they are the opposite right

2333.839 --> 2337.2799999999997
but that doesn't mean that the instinct

2335.44 --> 2340.32
is still there

2337.28 --> 2343.76
and that generation though those

2340.32 --> 2346.0
ages between that age range

2343.76 --> 2348.4
in my opinion is overall the most

2346.0 --> 2351.04
vulnerable to the mind control will have

2348.4 --> 2351.04
the most

2351.68 --> 2359.68
extreme responses to it for

2354.96 --> 2359.68
or against but especially for it

2360.24 --> 2364.64
because they are so slightly more

2363.92 --> 2368.7200000000003
desperate

2364.64 --> 2371.68
in that age range

2368.72 --> 2374.64
that's what i think the the much younger

2371.68 --> 2374.64
ones are still

2375.68 --> 2378.8799999999997
have more flexibility have more

2377.92 --> 2381.359
adaptation

2378.88 --> 2382.1600000000003
might be able to figure things out

2381.359 --> 2387.359
quicker

2382.16 --> 2389.7599999999998
to find the traps might find the bravery

2387.359 --> 2390.96
to actually resist it because they still

2389.76 --> 2393.5200000000004
have all the

2390.96 --> 2394.8
the youngness all the young energy the

2393.52 --> 2397.52
hormones in

2394.8 --> 2398.8
plenty amounts and all that they haven't

2397.52 --> 2403.52
been medically

2398.8 --> 2406.96
like mutilated or something

2403.52 --> 2406.96
by vaccines or whatever

2409.68 --> 2416.72
so yeah the younger before 20 can

2412.8 --> 2418.4
adapt better they also risk on just

2416.72 --> 2421.04
rolling right into it

2418.4 --> 2422.1600000000003
right it all depends on their attitude

2421.04 --> 2425.839
towards society

2422.16 --> 2430.16
their composure but between

2425.839 --> 2433.119
yeah after 40 i think that most people

2430.16 --> 2434.24
have enough wisdom and enough experience

2433.119 --> 2437.92
with

2434.24 --> 2439.839
false promises from government and even

2437.92 --> 2441.04
corporations they will have more

2439.839 --> 2444.48
likelihood to have

2441.04 --> 2448.079
caught on like this is not reliable

2444.48 --> 2452.96
really right there may still be those

2448.079 --> 2455.28
that are just completely

2452.96 --> 2458.16
set in their ways to be a surrenderist

2455.28 --> 2462.0
and they become like statist pawns

2458.16 --> 2463.52
after 40. but there will still be plenty

2462.0 --> 2467.359
of them

2463.52 --> 2469.839
that will actually have gained

2467.359 --> 2470.7999999999997
just enough wisdom momentum to kind of

2469.839 --> 2473.359
figure out like

2470.8 --> 2475.2000000000003
yeah it actually is all [ __ ] and i'm

2473.359 --> 2478.4
not gonna fall for it anymore

2475.2 --> 2481.4399999999996
i think that comes after 40 roughly

2478.4 --> 2482.8
but between 20 and and 40 that's like

2481.44 --> 2485.92
the biggest

2482.8 --> 2489.119
risk range psychologically

2485.92 --> 2491.599
in my humble opinion

2489.119 --> 2492.88
using my skills to roughly size that up

2491.599 --> 2495.44
and of course it's all

2492.88 --> 2497.52
average right talking about the average

2495.44 --> 2497.52
of

2498.24 --> 2501.2799999999997
millions of people

2503.44 --> 2506.56
but i think that's a good way to look at

2505.359 --> 2509.68
it like that

2506.56 --> 2511.92
to to get a feel of like yeah how

2509.68 --> 2512.7999999999997
does every age category typically

2511.92 --> 2515.28
respond where

2512.8 --> 2517.599
are they at physiologically in their

2515.28 --> 2523.599
psychological development

2517.599 --> 2526.1600000000003
what will they fall back on

2523.599 --> 2527.599
right so i hope that analysis helps a

2526.16 --> 2529.5989999999997
little

2527.599 --> 2531.6800000000003
to kind of map it out because age

2529.599 --> 2534.4
category matters a lot

2531.68 --> 2536.64
in the face of psychological warfare it

2534.4 --> 2538.96
matters everything

2536.64 --> 2539.839
older you are the more wisdom you gain

2538.96 --> 2542.079
the younger the

2539.839 --> 2543.119
you are the more flexible you are the

2542.079 --> 2546.2400000000002
more

2543.119 --> 2548.88
provision you get from your body

2546.24 --> 2549.5989999999997
in order to deal with things and even to

2548.88 --> 2551.92
medically

2549.599 --> 2554.319
overcome things right if you get

2551.92 --> 2556.079
poisoned when you're very young

2554.319 --> 2557.68
they're not talking like baby range of

2556.079 --> 2561.8390000000004
course but like

2557.68 --> 2563.9199999999996
teens like they can d they can

2561.839 --> 2566.96
handle a lot more [ __ ] and and

2563.92 --> 2570.079
potentially completely restore out of it

2566.96 --> 2573.2
much better than like

2570.079 --> 2574.48
well very very young preteen that's more

2573.2 --> 2578.0
risky

2574.48 --> 2580.72
and the later age categories

2578.0 --> 2582.24
where that adaptability also dies down a

2580.72 --> 2586.319
little

2582.24 --> 2589.4399999999996
and that starts roughly at 30. so yeah

2586.319 --> 2590.88
it's the age matters of a person in the

2589.44 --> 2593.04
face of this all and how

2590.88 --> 2594.319
they will be able to deal with it so

2593.04 --> 2598.16
keep that in mind

2594.319 --> 2601.119
every time yeah you you judge

2598.16 --> 2602.0
or you try to size up like how does how

2601.119 --> 2605.119
do these people

2602.0 --> 2608.56
think how will they respond

2605.119 --> 2612.88
age matters a lot

2608.56 --> 2620.4
and i hope i just made clear why

2612.88 --> 2624.0
in in a rough model

2620.4 --> 2626.2400000000002
well age wisdom yes but it all depends

2624.0 --> 2626.24
right

2627.92 --> 2631.92
because if you learn before you mature

2631.04 --> 2634.48
enough to

2631.92 --> 2635.52
to gain that wisdom if you've learned to

2634.48 --> 2637.839
really just

2635.52 --> 2639.599
become a pawn of the system if you

2637.839 --> 2641.2
actually enslaved yourself to their

2639.599 --> 2644.6400000000003
mechanisms

2641.2 --> 2646.8799999999997
then you will not gather that wisdom

2644.64 --> 2648.0
because just like with the ballers

2646.88 --> 2650.56
although that's much more

2648.0 --> 2652.319
extreme if you've just been a

2650.56 --> 2655.92
surrenderist all the time

2652.319 --> 2658.56
you're going to avoid realizing that and

2655.92 --> 2659.4
the way you are your composure is going

2658.56 --> 2662.4
to be

2659.4 --> 2665.44
automated into trying to

2662.4 --> 2666.4
prevent to let it sink in basically what

2665.44 --> 2668.96
you've done

2666.4 --> 2671.6800000000003
and people will carry that often the

2668.96 --> 2675.04
rest of their life until they die

2671.68 --> 2679.359
it will have formed them shaped them

2675.04 --> 2679.359
visibly you will know

2681.92 --> 2688.839
but that's only if

2685.68 --> 2690.64
yeah if you've decided to basically

2688.839 --> 2692.96
surrender

2690.64 --> 2694.0789999999997
during the earlier stages of your life

2692.96 --> 2698.88
to really become

2694.079 --> 2701.599
a status to become part of the system to

2698.88 --> 2705.839
be amoral about things usually is what

2701.599 --> 2705.839
is involved in that

2708.88 --> 2712.48
and if you haven't done that if you've

2710.72 --> 2714.7999999999997
avoided that because you've had some

2712.48 --> 2718.0
wise parents or other

2714.8 --> 2720.079
parental like influences that have

2718.0 --> 2721.359
effectively dissuaded you from doing

2720.079 --> 2725.119
that during your life

2721.359 --> 2728.16
then you might at some point actually

2725.119 --> 2730.56
grow that wisdom and truly get an

2728.16 --> 2731.2799999999997
insight a grip on what had actually

2730.56 --> 2733.92
happened

2731.28 --> 2734.6400000000003
and why it happens like that and then

2733.92 --> 2736.96
eventually

2734.64 --> 2738.7999999999997
yeah you become spiritually immune you

2736.96 --> 2742.0
can't be full again

2738.8 --> 2745.6800000000003
right that's the age of wisdom but

2742.0 --> 2745.68
you need to have resisted

2745.76 --> 2749.599
the influences in order to get to that

2748.079 --> 2751.44
point

2749.599 --> 2753.44
because if you surrender to the

2751.44 --> 2756.4
influences to the mind control

2753.44 --> 2758.2400000000002
then that wisdom will not get a chance

2756.4 --> 2759.44
to manifest because you'll start to

2758.24 --> 2762.72
develop mechanism

2759.44 --> 2766.2400000000002
psychologically to effectively avoid

2762.72 --> 2766.24
the moment of realization

2769.76 --> 2774.079
right it's it's like in a fully

2772.72 --> 2776.56
automated stockholm

2774.079 --> 2778.6400000000003
syndrome effect that's that's totally

2776.56 --> 2783.68
subconscious

2778.64 --> 2783.68
you'll defend the lie you've accepted

2784.72 --> 2788.64
and then defend it and then anything

2786.72 --> 2791.7599999999998
that attacks it information

2788.64 --> 2794.16
that contradicts it you will dismiss

2791.76 --> 2802.7200000000003
to avoid it to avoid the realization

2794.16 --> 2805.04
that you might have been wrong

2802.72 --> 2806.9599999999996
people were elders during the 60s 70s

2805.04 --> 2811.2799999999997
more likely to believe the moon landing

2806.96 --> 2811.28
right yeah of course

2811.359 --> 2818.96
but especially also young adults teens

2815.28 --> 2818.96
people that were teenagers

2819.28 --> 2822.6400000000003
during the moon landing those are the

2821.68 --> 2825.2
ones that all

2822.64 --> 2825.2
probably

2825.76 --> 2832.3190000000004
used it and even laid out this mechanism

2829.2 --> 2835.9199999999996
they used the moon landing glory the

2832.319 --> 2837.7599999999998
the achievement the hope science future

2835.92 --> 2842.079
blah blah

2837.76 --> 2842.8
to hold on to like a flame of hope like

2842.079 --> 2845.3590000000004
oh

2842.8 --> 2846.6400000000003
we can get through this right it will be

2845.359 --> 2849.04
an icon that will be

2846.64 --> 2850.319
much closer to their heart in a time

2849.04 --> 2852.8
when there was

2850.319 --> 2853.52
yeah the vietnam war which was terrible

2852.8 --> 2856.559
influence

2853.52 --> 2858.0
morally terrible influence right once

2856.559 --> 2861.52
you've used

2858.0 --> 2864.72
a lie at any point

2861.52 --> 2866.48
to hold on to to carry you through dark

2864.72 --> 2868.72
times

2866.48 --> 2870.96
then it becomes much more difficult to

2868.72 --> 2873.4399999999996
let that specific lie go

2870.96 --> 2874.4
because it saved you and how can

2873.44 --> 2876.48
anything

2874.4 --> 2878.4
that saved you be a lie right that's

2876.48 --> 2880.96
what the psyche does to that

2878.4 --> 2882.2400000000002
it's very tough becomes more tough like

2880.96 --> 2885.119
that

2882.24 --> 2886.64
once you hold on to a lie to carry you

2885.119 --> 2890.48
through on something

2886.64 --> 2901.839
then after that it yeah it becomes much

2890.48 --> 2901.839
more difficult to let it go

2923.44 --> 2925.76
right

2927.119 --> 2932.6400000000003
well not all people joseph

2930.16 --> 2934.3999999999996
not all a lot of it is also referred to

2932.64 --> 2936.72
signaling by people that don't really

2934.4 --> 2938.8
know what they're doing

2936.72 --> 2940.48
right they try to be relevant they try

2938.8 --> 2944.1600000000003
to be part

2940.48 --> 2946.72
of what of what's happening out there

2944.16 --> 2947.2799999999997
so they just kind of virtue signal all

2946.72 --> 2950.48
that

2947.28 --> 2951.76
right thank god for that because if

2950.48 --> 2955.359
everybody was just

2951.76 --> 2958.6400000000003
fully convinced and fully dedicated then

2955.359 --> 2971.839
the consequences are much more dire much

2958.64 --> 2971.839
more dangerous

2982.839 --> 2985.839
um

2988.64 --> 2994.96
yeah well joseph 369 for me

2991.76 --> 2997.599
911 was a real a real

2994.96 --> 2999.44
trial it was really tough for me

2997.599 --> 3001.3590000000004
psychologically

2999.44 --> 3004.0
because i knew there was something wrong

3001.359 --> 3004.4
about it but i had no idea back then how

3004.0 --> 3008.8
deep

3004.4 --> 3011.28
that went how deep the rabbit hole went

3008.8 --> 3012.88
when it happened and i still like

3011.28 --> 3015.28
watched the tv

3012.88 --> 3017.6800000000003
and the tower collapsing i i wasn't

3015.28 --> 3017.6800000000003
aware

3018.16 --> 3022.3999999999996
how much of it was a lie i thought like

3024.0 --> 3028.559
at first i really did kind of believe

3026.079 --> 3030.319
all of it or that it was like slightly

3028.559 --> 3032.88
put out of whack

3030.319 --> 3034.48
but i still believe that it wouldn't the

3032.88 --> 3037.359
the truth wouldn't be too

3034.48 --> 3037.839
far away from what they presented right

3037.359 --> 3040.88
i knew

3037.839 --> 3044.64
they were gonna politicize things

3040.88 --> 3046.0
typically especially because it was like

3044.64 --> 3049.1189999999997
bush and all that right

3046.0 --> 3051.92
didn't trust those neocons

3049.119 --> 3051.92
even back then

3052.96 --> 3059.04
but i had no idea like at the actual

3056.64 --> 3061.92
time when it physically happened

3059.04 --> 3069.839
in yeah in my experience i had no idea

3061.92 --> 3069.839
like how deep that actually went

3080.839 --> 3083.839
yes

3103.119 --> 3106.8
right yeah yeah well that was kind of

3105.599 --> 3110.4
obvious

3106.8 --> 3113.6800000000003
that was

3110.4 --> 3114.96
that iraq what had nothing to do with

3113.68 --> 3117.52
911

3114.96 --> 3120.559
that was like blatantly obvious like

3117.52 --> 3120.559
everybody knew that

3120.64 --> 3128.7999999999997
it was very obvious

3125.68 --> 3132.0789999999997
and they kind of let that also roll out

3128.8 --> 3132.079
even in mainstream

3136.839 --> 3142.5589999999997
media

3139.599 --> 3153.839
i mean not right at first but after was

3142.559 --> 3153.8390000000004
over yeah pretty much

3164.839 --> 3167.839
uh

3174.96 --> 3181.2
uh what style in 8012 you believe

3178.64 --> 3181.839
that what they say happened on 9 11

3181.2 --> 3184.8799999999997
actually

3181.839 --> 3188.88
no no way

3184.88 --> 3191.359
absolutely not there were no people in

3188.88 --> 3193.92
those planes

3191.359 --> 3196.88
that hit the tower there were no people

3193.92 --> 3209.599
in there they were radio controlled

3196.88 --> 3213.04
unmarked military craft

3209.599 --> 3215.839
and also yeah the tower didn't fall

3213.04 --> 3217.52
because of the planes hitting them you

3215.839 --> 3221.2799999999997
you do realize right

3217.52 --> 3226.16
they were officially ensured

3221.28 --> 3228.6400000000003
for billions billions

3226.16 --> 3231.5989999999997
to like literally was in the freaking

3228.64 --> 3234.0789999999997
contract of the insurance right

3231.599 --> 3236.2400000000002
that they would be insured for billions

3234.079 --> 3239.44
to never

3236.24 --> 3240.24
be able to collapse due to an airplane

3239.44 --> 3243.76
hitting them

3240.24 --> 3246.8799999999997
like literally like no

3243.76 --> 3247.28
no it wasn't possible they those towers

3246.88 --> 3250.6400000000003
were

3247.28 --> 3252.0
controlled demolished absolutely no

3250.64 --> 3254.0
other possibility now

3252.0 --> 3255.359
how they did that is another matter

3254.0 --> 3259.24
right

3255.359 --> 3262.24
nano thermite some freaking

3259.24 --> 3262.24
electrostatic

3263.079 --> 3266.559
destabilizing weapon

3266.88 --> 3271.04
weird could be all kinds of things but

3269.2 --> 3273.9199999999996
what it could not be

3271.04 --> 3275.359
is that a plane hitting them no matter

3273.92 --> 3278.64
like even if the plane was

3275.359 --> 3280.72
literally a giant canister of rocket

3278.64 --> 3284.0789999999997
fuel or something

3280.72 --> 3287.359
totally filled up like no air only fuel

3284.079 --> 3289.8390000000004
that would not have ever

3287.359 --> 3292.0
caused those buildings to collapse ever

3289.839 --> 3295.44
also yeah building seven just collapsed

3292.0 --> 3299.92
out of nowhere remember that right no

3295.44 --> 3303.04
so this ridiculous thing to say there

3299.92 --> 3303.04
still in 80 12.

3303.119 --> 3306.799
no the official story is absolutely not

3306.319 --> 3309.92
true

3306.799 --> 3312.96
in any shape or form how wrong

3309.92 --> 3314.079
was i when it really unfolded in my

3312.96 --> 3315.92
beliefs about it

3314.079 --> 3317.44
i thought there would be minor things

3315.92 --> 3322.4
that weren't real no it was

3317.44 --> 3322.4
all completely [ __ ]

3325.92 --> 3329.52
and like even the freaking people

3327.92 --> 3334.64
supposedly having done

3329.52 --> 3337.44
it they were all like being pampered

3334.64 --> 3337.92
and handled by cia every single one of

3337.44 --> 3341.599
them there's

3337.92 --> 3343.359
this whole like yeah a whole bunch of

3341.599 --> 3346.96
track records of what they did

3343.359 --> 3349.359
and [ __ ] this total setup

3346.96 --> 3350.799
it was a cooperative setup it was a

3349.359 --> 3353.839
controlled demolition it was a

3350.799 --> 3353.839
pre-planned thing

3354.0 --> 3360.799
not one side to set up the other no

3357.44 --> 3364.559
two sides working together

3360.799 --> 3367.359
to create a precedent to engage in wars

3364.559 --> 3367.3590000000004
in that region

3368.799 --> 3372.48
saudi arabia was involved israel was

3371.599 --> 3376.799
involved

3372.48 --> 3378.72
for sure

3376.799 --> 3381.119
but it was nothing like the original

3378.72 --> 3381.1189999999997
story

3386.0 --> 3390.0
that is one thing no no everything about

3388.88 --> 3394.1600000000003
it doesn't make sense i

3390.0 --> 3394.16
just laid it out everything about it

3394.4 --> 3399.599
everything about it makes no freaking

3396.559 --> 3399.599
sense whatsoever

3400.079 --> 3406.079
this is an extremely fake event

3404.079 --> 3408.2400000000002
if if you if you're gonna listen to the

3406.079 --> 3410.319
official story

3408.24 --> 3412.0789999999997
nothing about the official story about

3410.319 --> 3419.839
911 is correct

3412.079 --> 3419.8390000000004
all [ __ ]

3420.0 --> 3433.839
do you think the nsa was involved in 911

3434.64 --> 3439.52
i don't know it wasn't like the nsa even

3438.079 --> 3443.3590000000004
like

3439.52 --> 3448.88
created after 911

3443.359 --> 3450.72
wasn't it created after 911 i'm not sure

3448.88 --> 3452.559
i don't think they had a direct

3450.72 --> 3455.68
involvement in it

3452.559 --> 3455.6800000000003
in that happening

3456.4 --> 3461.52
they were definitely being utilized

3459.2 --> 3464.8799999999997
after that that's when the whole

3461.52 --> 3466.48
patriot act [ __ ] happened yeah exactly

3464.88 --> 3468.88
it happened after

3466.48 --> 3469.92
so no the nsa has no direct involvement

3468.88 --> 3475.839
in 911

3469.92 --> 3475.839
because they weren't created yet

3480.88 --> 3489.839
no plates yeah sure michael khan well

3484.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
there's weird [ __ ] but i i'm not

3489.92 --> 3496.079
it's no use to to put that idea in there

3496.64 --> 3503.839
in my opinion like yeah

3506.559 --> 3509.28
oh okay

3513.04 --> 3517.7599999999998
well maybe right okay steamy traveler

3515.92 --> 3521.52
what if it was created that early are

3517.76 --> 3521.5200000000004
you sure it's not just the cia

3524.48 --> 3531.44
but they certainly got like a power

3528.24 --> 3534.319
an authority overhaul after

3531.44 --> 3534.319
9 11 then

3534.559 --> 3538.96
they got a lot of more power after that

3536.64 --> 3538.96
happened

3540.24 --> 3546.4799999999996
yes steli in 80 12 i know

3543.52 --> 3550.559
i saw that like i even saw that video

3546.48 --> 3550.559
when it came out the first time on tv

3551.04 --> 3556.24
like like this just came through like oh

3554.64 --> 3558.48
building seven has collapsed and it's

3556.24 --> 3561.2799999999997
right there smoking

3558.48 --> 3562.16
yeah i remember that and being like what

3561.28 --> 3565.6800000000003
what is this

3562.16 --> 3565.68
what's going on this is weird

3566.0 --> 3569.839
like oh they're mocking up somehow but i

3567.92 --> 3570.2400000000002
didn't even understand the implications

3569.839 --> 3572.64
of it

3570.24 --> 3574.3999999999996
back then because i was like when 911

3572.64 --> 3577.04
haven't happened i was totally

3574.4 --> 3577.04
unprepared

3584.839 --> 3590.0
tsa oh right right

3588.319 --> 3593.839
yeah you're right aaron brown yeah i

3590.0 --> 3601.839
mixed them up was the tsa not the nsa

3593.839 --> 3601.839
uh okay i don't know

3602.079 --> 3606.88
right so i don't know aaron brown maybe

3604.079 --> 3608.96
nsa was involved i don't know

3606.88 --> 3615.839
but yeah it was the tsa that was created

3608.96 --> 3615.839
not the nsa that's right

3622.799 --> 3631.92
well yeah well joseph three six nine

3628.24 --> 3633.2
just think about it planes no planes oh

3631.92 --> 3636.2400000000002
there were something else

3633.2 --> 3639.2799999999997
how is that relevant to

3636.24 --> 3640.0789999999997
anything in the entire setup of that

3639.28 --> 3642.559
situation

3640.079 --> 3644.7200000000003
how is it relevant whether there were

3642.559 --> 3648.88
planes actually hitting it or not

3644.72 --> 3650.8799999999997
how like you can switch

3648.88 --> 3652.799
presupposition you can switch it on

3650.88 --> 3656.4
planes no planes planes

3652.799 --> 3659.839
no planes how is that relevant

3656.4 --> 3662.64
to anything

3659.839 --> 3662.64
you tell me

3662.88 --> 3666.2400000000002
how is it relevant to anything michael

3665.839 --> 3668.48
khan

3666.24 --> 3670.64
you tell me right now whether there were

3668.48 --> 3673.04
planes or no planes

3670.64 --> 3675.1189999999997
how is it relevant to anything at all in

3673.04 --> 3678.88
the wider picture

3675.119 --> 3682.4
because as far as i'm concerned it only

3678.88 --> 3685.04
makes it more confusing distracting

3682.4 --> 3685.6800000000003
cookie sounding it's actually the no

3685.04 --> 3689.52
planes

3685.68 --> 3693.2
is probably a controlled opposition

3689.52 --> 3695.7599999999998
information placement to make 911

3693.2 --> 3696.799
truthers more ridiculous in order to

3695.76 --> 3699.76
dissuade

3696.799 --> 3701.28
the doubting public i think that's what

3699.76 --> 3704.48
no planes is

3701.28 --> 3707.76
it's completely irrelevant in the wider

3704.48 --> 3707.76
scape of the situation

3707.839 --> 3716.799
wrong no

3713.599 --> 3719.92
hijacking as opposed to demolition but

3716.799 --> 3719.92
that makes no sense

3721.52 --> 3726.48
like it it doesn't matter it doesn't

3724.88 --> 3728.7200000000003
matter the planes could have

3726.48 --> 3730.079
never caused the freaking buildings to

3728.72 --> 3733.7599999999998
go down ever

3730.079 --> 3736.48
it was insured for billions of dollars

3733.76 --> 3738.8390000000004
against it because it's absolutely

3736.48 --> 3742.16
impossible

3738.839 --> 3747.2799999999997
absolutely impossible no matter what

3742.16 --> 3747.2799999999997
it could never have done anything

3751.52 --> 3754.64
it changes the story yeah and how does

3754.319 --> 3758.0
it

3754.64 --> 3761.1189999999997
actually change it in the wider picture

3758.0 --> 3768.64
it doesn't it has no relevance

3761.119 --> 3771.44
whatsoever it's just so in confusion

3768.64 --> 3774.48
like oh no brains oh yeah that's really

3771.44 --> 3776.64
confusing causes people to get confused

3774.48 --> 3777.68
not really be stable in their train of

3776.64 --> 3780.24
thinking

3777.68 --> 3782.0
and think about how to actually picture

3780.24 --> 3785.9199999999996
the realistic thing about it no

3782.0 --> 3789.119
it's literally a confusing distraction

3785.92 --> 3791.52
to dissuade outsiders that are doubting

3789.119 --> 3794.559
about the whole thing

3791.52 --> 3797.52
that's what it is it has no function

3794.559 --> 3798.799
whatsoever to suggest that no planes hit

3797.52 --> 3801.839
the towers

3798.799 --> 3803.92
none whatsoever

3801.839 --> 3806.0789999999997
i think it's an infra information

3803.92 --> 3808.2400000000002
placement psyop

3806.079 --> 3809.28
that's what i think it is no planes it's

3808.24 --> 3812.64
a psyop

3809.28 --> 3815.3590000000004
specifically to gas light

3812.64 --> 3817.44
to muddy the water of 9 11 true that's

3815.359 --> 3820.5589999999997
what it is

3817.44 --> 3822.88
and yeah i'm i'm pretty much 99 sure

3820.559 --> 3826.48
about this now

3822.88 --> 3826.48
because i've seen it before

3826.96 --> 3832.359
it's completely useless effectively to

3829.839 --> 3833.7599999999998
have this knowledge or to consider it is

3832.359 --> 3836.64
completely

3833.76 --> 3838.0
useless has no relevant influence

3836.64 --> 3841.0389999999998
whatsoever the only thing

3838.0 --> 3842.88
it does gaslight the situation make it

3841.039 --> 3845.44
more confusing and dissuade

3842.88 --> 3846.48
doubters about the situation from

3845.44 --> 3848.4
engaging

3846.48 --> 3849.92
because it's kooky it's crazy when you

3848.4 --> 3853.839
think that yeah exactly

3849.92 --> 3856.079
so it's completely irrelevant

3853.839 --> 3857.0389999999998
does it matter whether planes hit the

3856.079 --> 3860.96
building or not

3857.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
has no consequences on the wider picture

3860.96 --> 3867.839
what so ever

3869.65 --> 3872.739
[Music]

3875.92 --> 3882.16
has no relevance hello people

3879.44 --> 3883.68
hello am i getting through to you am i

3882.16 --> 3886.3999999999996
catching your air

3883.68 --> 3886.799
are you thinking about what i just said

3886.4 --> 3890.2400000000002
it

3886.799 --> 3892.0
doesn't matter whether the planes hit

3890.24 --> 3892.9599999999996
the building or no planes hit the

3892.0 --> 3896.24
building

3892.96 --> 3900.319
on the entire situation has no

3896.24 --> 3903.9199999999996
relevant influence to decide

3900.319 --> 3909.839
on either no relevant

3903.92 --> 3909.839
influence it doesn't matter

3912.319 --> 3918.72
oh you think media was involved oh no

3915.44 --> 3923.359
play oh you have to you have to say no

3918.72 --> 3925.2799999999997
planes to prove the media was involved

3923.359 --> 3928.799
oh really ask and receive

3925.28 --> 3930.799
oh you need that no planes to to to make

3928.799 --> 3932.799
it obvious that the media had to be

3930.799 --> 3933.68
involved you think the media was

3932.799 --> 3937.44
involved

3933.68 --> 3940.8799999999997
really uh you don't need

3937.44 --> 3942.079
no planes to point out the media was

3940.88 --> 3944.2400000000002
freaking involved it

3942.079 --> 3945.92
couldn't be more obvious the media was

3944.24 --> 3948.0
involved they were prepared for the

3945.92 --> 3950.88
whole thing

3948.0 --> 3951.68
they roll out a whole disaster response

3950.88 --> 3954.96
program

3951.68 --> 3957.68
because of it remember like

3954.96 --> 3958.079
the video report like oh the tower just

3957.68 --> 3960.0
fell

3958.079 --> 3961.119
when it's right behind her right hadn't

3960.0 --> 3965.359
filled yet

3961.119 --> 3968.0
right i think that's plenty

3965.359 --> 3969.0389999999998
that's plenty to prove that the media

3968.0 --> 3971.92
was

3969.039 --> 3972.559
involved just that video clip that went

3971.92 --> 3975.76
out live

3972.559 --> 3978.2400000000002
that's enough you don't need no

3975.76 --> 3978.88
planes to point out the media was

3978.24 --> 3983.0389999999998
involved

3978.88 --> 3987.2000000000003
stop being stupid

3983.039 --> 3990.1600000000003
stop latching on to the psyop

3987.2 --> 3991.1189999999997
idea oh it's so special no planes no

3990.16 --> 3993.839
planes it's so

3991.119 --> 3994.88
important to say it's no planes because

3993.839 --> 3998.72
it'll make me look

3994.88 --> 4002.559
[ __ ] insane yeah good job

3998.72 --> 4006.0789999999997
good job or you could just ignore it

4002.559 --> 4008.7200000000003
and look at the obvious facts

4006.079 --> 4011.3590000000004
the obvious facts and realize it's

4008.72 --> 4012.48
completely irrelevant whether planes hit

4011.359 --> 4016.319
the buildings or not

4012.48 --> 4020.16
in the entire setup irrelevant

4016.319 --> 4020.64
doesn't matter stop holding on to psyop

4020.16 --> 4025.2799999999997
info

4020.64 --> 4025.2799999999997
placement that makes you look stupid and

4032.839 --> 4038.0789999999997
crazy

4034.079 --> 4038.079
well i don't care that you don't care

4038.48 --> 4042.559
look dude you can freaking believe there

4040.96 --> 4044.7200000000003
was unicorns or

4042.559 --> 4047.039
santa claus ran into the freaking

4044.72 --> 4050.16
buildings and made it explode okay

4047.039 --> 4051.76
yeah say whatever the [ __ ] insane [ __ ]

4050.16 --> 4054.319
you want to say about it

4051.76 --> 4056.6400000000003
i don't care what the normies think well

4054.319 --> 4058.96
maybe it's not what the normies think

4056.64 --> 4060.16
you should become you should be worried

4058.96 --> 4062.2400000000002
about how about

4060.16 --> 4064.0789999999997
what other people that are trying to

4062.24 --> 4065.68
stay reasonable and trying to stay on

4064.079 --> 4069.8390000000004
top of things

4065.68 --> 4073.2799999999997
that are trying to create a prolonged

4069.839 --> 4073.7599999999998
truth narrative decentralized truth

4073.28 --> 4075.92
nerves

4073.76 --> 4077.5200000000004
maybe it depends maybe it matters what

4075.92 --> 4078.64
they will think about you ever

4077.52 --> 4081.28
considered that

4078.64 --> 4082.5589999999997
that it makes you look very stupid when

4081.28 --> 4085.92
you latch onto

4082.559 --> 4088.8390000000004
no planes hit it like

4085.92 --> 4090.96
whether it's true or not doesn't even

4088.839 --> 4094.0389999999998
matter what matters is

4090.96 --> 4096.04
is that whether the planes hit or not is

4094.039 --> 4100.2390000000005
completely

4096.04 --> 4105.839
irrelevant in the entire scenario

4100.239 --> 4105.839
that's what matters

4115.04 --> 4118.64
yeah and i am open-minded i just

4117.6 --> 4122.0
entertained

4118.64 --> 4125.279
that concept and then pointed out

4122.0 --> 4127.359
how it's completely irrelevant

4125.279 --> 4128.96
and you shouldn't be latching on to it

4127.359 --> 4132.0
right

4128.96 --> 4134.96
you shouldn't be it's

4132.0 --> 4134.96
not relevant

4135.839 --> 4141.04
it's not obsessing over niche details

4138.799 --> 4143.92
that have no relevance it just makes you

4141.04 --> 4143.92
look crazy

4144.319 --> 4152.799
hey will williams welcome bro

4149.04 --> 4152.799

thank you so much

4199.12 --> 4203.84
enjoy it extra lately awesome

4204.56 --> 4208.4800000000005
that's always good to hear when good

4206.32 --> 4217.84
people get bonuses

4208.48 --> 4217.839999999999
that's good to hear man

4226.96 --> 4233.44
that's right iron fe 911

4230.4 --> 4237.04
it was pulled as a to create the patriot

4233.44 --> 4240.4
act it was there to create the wound

4237.04 --> 4242.96
to justify the aggression

4240.4 --> 4245.12
that's basically it and it was

4242.96 --> 4248.8
pre-planned for a long time

4245.12 --> 4251.36
remember the documents from even the 90s

4248.8 --> 4252.08
where they're laid out like the freaking

4251.36 --> 4254.159
document

4252.08 --> 4255.36
was about creating a new pearl harbor

4254.159 --> 4258.48
situation with

4255.36 --> 4261.199
literally the two towers

4258.48 --> 4264.0
and an airplane on the front page of the

4261.199 --> 4266.0
freaking document in the 90s

4264.0 --> 4269.199
talking about how to create a new pearl

4266.0 --> 4269.199
harbor okay

4274.56 --> 4279.84
right now that is relevant that's

4277.52 --> 4280.64
important to know and realize about it

4279.84 --> 4282.64
that has

4280.64 --> 4284.08
a lot of implication on the bigger

4282.64 --> 4285.76
picture

4284.08 --> 4287.12
you're sending people over yeah i'm

4285.76 --> 4290.320000000001
gonna round out the show but

4287.12 --> 4290.32
ah i'm just going

4292.48 --> 4299.839999999999
but yeah do check out nathan oakley's

4296.56 --> 4301.84
stream it's starting up any second now

4299.84 --> 4315.6
he put out the link

4301.84 --> 4318.2390000000005
earlier in chat

4315.6 --> 4318.2390000000005
what the

4321.76 --> 4329.84
the hell is that steamy traveler

4329.92 --> 4336.8
right anyway i am rounding out the show

4333.36 --> 4339.199
so thanks everyone for coming we want to

4336.8 --> 4343.84
talk 911 now but i don't really want to

4339.199 --> 4346.719
talk 911.

4343.84 --> 4349.4400000000005
but it's good in the face of the other

4346.719 --> 4351.84
subject that i talk about about

4349.44 --> 4354.839999999999
like the age category how they respond

4351.84 --> 4356.88
to psychological warfare and cult

4354.84 --> 4357.76
indoctrination to put it into the

4356.88 --> 4359.92
context of

4357.76 --> 4362.08
that conversation yeah it was useful to

4359.92 --> 4364.56
bring up 911 but i don't i don't want to

4362.08 --> 4367.84
have like a 9 11. oh let's talk about

4364.56 --> 4367.84
all the details it's

4368.96 --> 4372.2390000000005
but i'm glad i was able to make the

4370.64 --> 4375.04
point about like the entire

4372.239 --> 4375.04
no planes

4375.44 --> 4382.639999999999
and like even if it was no planes

4379.44 --> 4382.639999999999
it is a psyop

4382.719 --> 4387.52
it is a sigh of one way or the other

4384.96 --> 4389.76
it's a psyop it was a sight to do that

4387.52 --> 4392.2390000000005
and it was a psy up on how that piece of

4389.76 --> 4395.12
information was unrolled specifically to

4392.239 --> 4398.32
dissuade people that doubt about 9 11

4395.12 --> 4401.679
truth to doubt it even more

4398.32 --> 4404.239
to draw it into kooky sounding world

4401.679 --> 4408.4
that's what it was designed for whether

4404.239 --> 4411.599999999999
it's actually true or not is irrelevant

4408.4 --> 4415.28
because everything did still unroll

4411.6 --> 4418.08
after that and

4415.28 --> 4418.639999999999
mechanically it has no relevance either

4418.08 --> 4420.64
because

4418.64 --> 4422.08
planes could never have brought down the

4420.64 --> 4423.92
towers anyway

4422.08 --> 4425.679
so whether their planes actually hitting

4423.92 --> 4426.159
or not is completely irrelevant to the

4425.679 --> 4429.04
entire

4426.159 --> 4430.879999999999
thing happening it is it's irrelevant

4429.04 --> 4434.239
and that's

4430.88 --> 4437.28
what i want to stick to about it

4434.239 --> 4439.36
so thanks everyone for coming

4437.28 --> 4441.28
