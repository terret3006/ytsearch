20 minutes late

106.32 --> 110.75899999999999
and of course there's the hour time

109.2 --> 113.299
difference now with Europe and the

110.759 --> 113.299
United States

114.68 --> 118.52000000000001
right

116.299 --> 119.82000000000001
and yeah the weather

118.52 --> 121.86
[Music]

119.82 --> 123.65899999999999
I don't know man it started off kind of

121.86 --> 127.2
nice but now it's just all gray soup

123.659 --> 129.02
again it even rained a little

127.2 --> 132.48
few droplets

129.02 --> 135.44
also the temperature apparently went

132.48 --> 135.44
down dramatically

135.72 --> 141.12
just checked it from 16 degrees Celsius

138.48 --> 142.56
so that went down six degrees all of a

141.12 --> 143.28
sudden even though it doesn't even look

142.56 --> 147.2
any

143.28 --> 147.2
different from yesterday really

148.98 --> 153.98
yeah I did

150.18 --> 153.98000000000002
apparently cool down quite a bit

159.44 --> 165.959
all right

162.599 --> 168.599
hello flatter Sage first in chat I guess

165.959 --> 174.959
good to see you

168.599 --> 174.959
it is Monday the 31st of October 2022

181.099 --> 186.42
and yeah I'm to be fair I'm kind of

183.84 --> 188.22
liking this hour shift

186.42 --> 192.05999999999997
because I was getting trouble like

188.22 --> 195.48
getting up early and not being sleepy so

192.06 --> 199.739
it's actually really handy for me

195.48 --> 202.28
because now I don't have that issue

199.739 --> 202.28
anyway

203.28 --> 206.0
ah

206.7 --> 211.28
don't have any specific subjects

212.58 --> 215.239
gender

215.4 --> 217.87900000000002
yesterday

218.04 --> 223.07999999999998
oh yesterday's Flat Earth early bird

220.2 --> 225.29899999999998
show was actually really good

223.08 --> 230.22
didn't watch it back but

225.299 --> 231.84
yeah from what I remember I liked it

230.22 --> 233.76
uh

231.84 --> 236.659
let's see what else

233.76 --> 236.659
out there

237.14 --> 240.14
[Music]

238.14 --> 240.14
um

241.08 --> 244.14000000000001
flat side had another live stream that

243.12 --> 245.879
was fun

244.14 --> 247.2
I'm starting to like his live streams

245.879 --> 249.48
more and more

247.2 --> 251.819
maybe that's his is also because when

249.48 --> 254.879
I'm in the chat he actually does

251.819 --> 257.88
shout me out a lot but it's also just

254.879 --> 260.459
yeah it's an entertaining show

257.88 --> 262.26
and he brought up that uh that

260.459 --> 264.9
interesting Black Swan footage of one

262.26 --> 268.09999999999997
foot observation right

264.9 --> 268.09999999999997
actually showed it

269.34 --> 273.71999999999997
and that was pretty much the subject of

271.08 --> 277.4
his show yesterday

273.72 --> 277.40000000000003
uh no Jim Bob

279.06 --> 285.86
some yeah premieres

281.82 --> 285.86
on uh off to flatter debate

289.979 --> 296.46
uh

292.28 --> 298.08
right and then actually yeah I watched I

296.46 --> 299.88
downloaded

298.08 --> 302.82
because I realized I've never actually

299.88 --> 305.9
watched any of it but I downloaded The

302.82 --> 305.9
Chronicles of Narnia

306.479 --> 312.9
and I watched the first movie and it's

310.139 --> 314.759
really weird

312.9 --> 317.58
there's something really unsettling

314.759 --> 321.24
about that movie in different ways but

317.58 --> 325.74
it's also just really well crafted

321.24 --> 327.18
it's such a strange movie and now I

325.74 --> 330.18
remember that

327.18 --> 331.68
I probably saw like half of it

330.18 --> 336.5
one time

331.68 --> 336.5
and it just really did not like it

337.5 --> 341.88
I don't know even why

339.479 --> 343.86
maybe I was yeah probably because of the

341.88 --> 346.88
timing I mean that was like right around

343.86 --> 346.88
when my mother died

348.24 --> 355.199
so yeah but I never really watched it

353.34 --> 356.58
and now I'm like watching it because

355.199 --> 360.0
well

356.58 --> 362.639
if only because Nathan uses it as a

360.0 --> 364.199
hilarious example all the time and I

362.639 --> 365.1
thought like I should actually watch

364.199 --> 368.1
this

365.1 --> 370.32000000000005
but immediately I remembered yeah

368.1 --> 372.96000000000004
watching it the some of the details

370.32 --> 374.94
which are just annoyingly stupid like

372.96 --> 378.23999999999995
really annoying

374.94 --> 381.0
then again it's a dream

378.24 --> 384.12
sort of thingy

381.0 --> 385.68
but the main thing is that

384.12 --> 387.78000000000003
yeah

385.68 --> 390.06
a bunch of kids

387.78 --> 391.85999999999996
and they were very well developed

390.06 --> 394.02
characters by the way so that part was

391.86 --> 398.28000000000003
pretty cool I like the dynamic I like

394.02 --> 400.56
the kids like even the shitty one

398.28 --> 402.96
it was reasonable I mean

400.56 --> 404.759
but

402.96 --> 407.94
how they then

404.759 --> 410.22
pretty much are forced and that is an

407.94 --> 412.94
interesting situation for a story but

410.22 --> 415.8
they're like forced to become like

412.94 --> 418.979
generals of an army

415.8 --> 421.38
and then oh they're just gonna battle I

418.979 --> 422.9
mean yeah just pick up a sword and you

421.38 --> 426.12
start hacking it

422.9 --> 426.96
it's send towers and [ __ ] like what the

426.12 --> 430.38
[ __ ]

426.96 --> 432.35999999999996
there's no [ __ ] way anybody could

430.38 --> 436.44
ever do that

432.36 --> 438.96000000000004
just like that no way like have you ever

436.44 --> 443.34
tried wearing armor

438.96 --> 445.69899999999996
actual played armor dude

443.34 --> 449.28
that's not [ __ ] easy that like

445.699 --> 451.94
requires a lot of training to even be

449.28 --> 454.919
able to move properly in that [ __ ]

451.94 --> 458.4
especially if you're not like

454.919 --> 461.81899999999996
military drilled guy with huge bulking

458.4 --> 464.88
muscles which well they were kids so no

461.819 --> 468.41900000000004
and that really annoyed me I mean that

464.88 --> 471.28
really annoyed me that's like that was

468.419 --> 472.38
disgusting that that detail

471.28 --> 475.38
[Music]

472.38 --> 478.56
I did not like that at all what I did

475.38 --> 481.979
like about the movie however is

478.56 --> 483.84
beautiful landscapes

481.979 --> 487.5
pretty good music

483.84 --> 489.84
I felt a lot of Gustav Holst influence

487.5 --> 492.12
it's like yeah well the ice queen and

489.84 --> 494.52
she's really she's an actual evil

492.12 --> 497.699
character that's actually really evil

494.52 --> 499.25899999999996
kind of Game of Thrones type evil

497.699 --> 502.62
and that's

499.259 --> 504.41900000000004
yeah that that's cool I mean it's like

502.62 --> 506.94
an actual evil it's actually really

504.419 --> 508.62
dangerous instead of just some wannabe

506.94 --> 512.18
neither

508.62 --> 512.18
so that's cool

512.339 --> 518.0
and it was interesting the interactions

514.44 --> 518.0
there's a lot to learn from that

520.86 --> 524.82
right so I'm very curious to see what

523.08 --> 526.98
the rest of the movies are going to be

524.82 --> 528.4200000000001
there's three of them I've never even

526.98 --> 532.4590000000001
clicked

528.42 --> 532.459
the second two ever

532.92 --> 537.899
but I can now

535.98 --> 540.08
the books are the best yeah well I get

537.899 --> 540.08
it

541.38 --> 546.18
it

543.42 --> 549.42
the way the characters are written

546.18 --> 553.019
tells me it must be a very good book

549.42 --> 555.3
very well written

553.019 --> 557.339
I mean everything gets pretty close to

555.3 --> 558.54
you it's it's all very written very

557.339 --> 561.5400000000001
sensitively

558.54 --> 564.779
it's just that some of these things are

561.54 --> 567.0
like annoying magical thinking like oh

564.779 --> 570.66
yo you just put an armor on and a sword

567.0 --> 572.82
and you just go to war against magical

570.66 --> 577.3199999999999
monsters like you've never had training

572.82 --> 580.5
before and you're gonna win that right

577.32 --> 583.08
[ __ ] that was really annoying about

580.5 --> 585.36
it that's the like one of the things

583.08 --> 587.339
especially if you contrast a bat with

585.36 --> 590.399
like the Lord of the Rings Lord of the

587.339 --> 593.58
Rings Tolkien absolutely got that part

590.399 --> 595.92
right and he would like there was a lot

593.58 --> 597.6
of like realism about how dangerous

595.92 --> 599.8199999999999
battle really is

597.6 --> 603.38
in The Lord of the Rings in general but

599.82 --> 603.38
also in the movie that was just

604.32 --> 608.5100000000001
that was well balanced and in this movie

607.14 --> 611.3389999999999
it was just ridiculous

608.51 --> 613.26
[Music]

611.339 --> 616.5
very childish

613.26 --> 618.72
and that's annoying because it the rest

616.5 --> 621.0
of it is like a really serious story so

618.72 --> 623.1
why then have some stupid childish

621.0 --> 624.899
magical thinking [ __ ] in there it's

623.1 --> 627.44
annoying

624.899 --> 627.44
but

629.1 --> 632.36
yeah I bet that the book reads a lot

631.08 --> 636.24
better

632.36 --> 638.7
also weird Ashland is a weird

636.24 --> 641.1
figure

638.7 --> 644.22
I'm not sure if I really liked Liam

641.1 --> 647.64
Neeson as a voice of him because Liam

644.22 --> 649.94
Neeson is not a wise person

647.64 --> 652.98
at all

649.94 --> 654.839
as you can hear that in his voice I can

652.98 --> 657.9590000000001
hear that in his voice spiritual

654.839 --> 660.36
metadata I mean Liam Neeson is a pretty

657.959 --> 663.3
handsome character and he's well spoken

660.36 --> 666.0600000000001
he has very good voice range dynamic

663.3 --> 668.04
but he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

666.06 --> 670.3199999999999
I'm sorry dude

668.04 --> 672.36
I kind of like you as an actor but

670.32 --> 675.36
you're you as a person you're a [ __ ]

672.36 --> 679.279
[ __ ] you're dumb and you can hear that

675.36 --> 679.279
in your voice and it's [ __ ] annoying

680.33 --> 686.0
[Music]

683.279 --> 686.0
ugh

687.3 --> 693.92
and so that didn't really fit

690.54 --> 693.92
for the character I thought

695.16 --> 702.0
so aesthetic issues with it

699.12 --> 706.019
I'm probably not the only one

702.0 --> 708.779
I mean I bet that book readers are were

706.019 --> 711.6
kind of insulted by the movies even more

708.779 --> 713.7
than Lord of the Rings readers were by

711.6 --> 715.019
the Lord of the Rings movies

713.7 --> 719.72
because there was some things wrong with

715.019 --> 719.72
that those as well but less I'd say

720.36 --> 724.14
and I know because I actually read the

722.339 --> 727.86
Lord of the Rings book from beginning to

724.14 --> 729.899
end the extended versions

727.86 --> 732.6
so

729.899 --> 735.3
right but I am kind of looking forward

732.6 --> 737.94
to seeing the second movie

735.3 --> 740.459
and the third

737.94 --> 744.019
but it was

740.459 --> 744.0189999999999
like very intense

747.0 --> 751.38
but then again there seemed to be some

749.339 --> 754.8000000000001
kind of dramatic cheat system there as

751.38 --> 758.1
well as in like oh all kinds of figures

754.8 --> 759.18
that seemingly die or get turned to

758.1 --> 760.98
stone

759.18 --> 763.3199999999999
and then at the end it's like oh no

760.98 --> 767.899
they're all alive again and that kind of

763.32 --> 767.899
negates the whole drama impact of it

768.959 --> 773.579
right first it's like holy [ __ ] like

771.36 --> 776.399
there's like a real war thing here

773.579 --> 779.8199999999999
almost like Pan's Labyrinth right like

776.399 --> 782.88
there's some serious dark [ __ ] hair and

779.82 --> 785.88
like oh so yeah they didn't do as the

782.88 --> 789.12
evil ruler told them and then they just

785.88 --> 791.579
get killed or seemingly so turn to Stone

789.12 --> 793.44
and it's like oh my god what the hell

791.579 --> 796.5
this world is really [ __ ] up

793.44 --> 797.5790000000001
but then later it's like oh they're all

796.5 --> 799.98
back again

797.579 --> 802.68
and it's kind of like what the [ __ ] it

799.98 --> 804.36
was the point of all that

802.68 --> 806.88
I don't know

804.36 --> 808.2
maybe I just don't like Narnia

806.88 --> 810.36
Chronicles

808.2 --> 812.7
maybe I don't like the setup of it I did

810.36 --> 815.82
really like the music and the Aesthetics

812.7 --> 819.0600000000001
like the art was really amazing in the

815.82 --> 821.82
movie I have to give him that

819.06 --> 824.959
I mean the ice queen Palace was pretty

821.82 --> 824.9590000000001
freaking amazing

825.12 --> 827.3
foreign

827.4 --> 831.14
[Music]

833.339 --> 837.62
so I had a lot of mixed feelings about

835.38 --> 837.62
it

841.1 --> 847.32
it's like I like the characters I did

844.32 --> 850.32
not like the game master too much that's

847.32 --> 851.1600000000001
how I would describe my criticism about

850.32 --> 853.6800000000001
it

851.16 --> 856.139
you know do you guys get what I mean

853.68 --> 859.1999999999999
I mean the characters were pretty good

856.139 --> 862.26
in their character they were really them

859.2 --> 864.1800000000001
it's just that the Storyteller the way

862.26 --> 866.66
everything on the road was just kind of

864.18 --> 866.66
messy

866.76 --> 869.36
like

869.459 --> 874.5
a fake out

871.56 --> 877.26
big serious build up like actual weight

874.5 --> 880.38
people are dying and then suddenly like

877.26 --> 884.519
oh oh no no no Aslan is suddenly alive

880.38 --> 886.68
again and and then oh now the rest is

884.519 --> 888.24
all suddenly revived and it's just like

886.68 --> 889.5999999999999
oh nothing ever happened and it's like

888.24 --> 892.72
what the [ __ ] is this

889.6 --> 892.72
[Music]

893.66 --> 898.86
yeah I did not like it

896.579 --> 900.959
but maybe it's like really meant for

898.86 --> 902.639
more little kids that will then have

900.959 --> 905.2199999999999
like all this tension like oh no is it

902.639 --> 908.04
gonna be all right this is so scary and

905.22 --> 910.5600000000001
then Aslan resurrects and

908.04 --> 912.42
and raises everybody else and then yeah

910.56 --> 914.8199999999999
as a little kid I would probably be

912.42 --> 916.38
really relieved like oh thank God it's

914.82 --> 919.44
not that bad

916.38 --> 921.0
but as a more adult viewer I just

919.44 --> 925.44
thought like

921.0 --> 928.16
yeah well there goes all the the weight

925.44 --> 928.1600000000001
of it

929.579 --> 934.019
right

930.779 --> 937.579
anyway what did you guys think

934.019 --> 937.579
what do you think of my analysis

939.48 --> 945.9590000000001
anyway hello

942.839 --> 949.4590000000001
BJC net Professor Phil Bell George

982.69 --> 986.509
[Music]

987.24 --> 992.1
foreign

989.779 --> 993.15
exams all right I hope that went all

992.1 --> 997.059
right

993.15 --> 997.059
[Music]

1012.98 --> 1017.48
which book I'm not reviewing a book I'm

1015.38 --> 1019.3389999999999
reviewing a movie

1017.48 --> 1022.279
now we're talking about The Chronicles

1019.339 --> 1024.98
of Narnia the first one

1022.279 --> 1026.839
is the witch

1024.98 --> 1030.199
which wardrobe the most convoluted

1026.839 --> 1034.839
dumbass name you could ever choose

1030.199 --> 1034.8390000000002
because it makes it very long and clunky

1038.0 --> 1045.1
but yeah the first movie

1041.36 --> 1045.1
hey Nathan Oakley good to see you

1061.52 --> 1065.539
yeah how's your sound system working

1063.5 --> 1068.12
this week Nathan

1065.539 --> 1069.86
I think

1068.12 --> 1072.76
you can do the shows without any

1069.86 --> 1072.76
problems this time

1081.77 --> 1086.46
[Music]

1089.59 --> 1099.839
[Music]

1109.22 --> 1111.82
hmm

1114.26 --> 1120.74
oh cool Hello Only the Lonely I that's a

1118.16 --> 1123.64
detail I didn't know but

1120.74 --> 1123.64
interesting

1136.22 --> 1140.3600000000001
I had a club huh

1141.98 --> 1147.919
is it like a DND Club except without the

1145.46 --> 1152.559
game but just like

1147.919 --> 1152.5590000000002
back and forth story games or something

1155.559 --> 1160.059
hey PJ Cruikshank good to see you

1160.6 --> 1163.81
[Music]

1163.94 --> 1169.1000000000001
in the formal literary discussion group

1166.76 --> 1172.96
right

1169.1 --> 1172.9599999999998
so basically like a book club

1173.36 --> 1176.58
exit more like a writer's glove

1175.34 --> 1179.81
interesting

1176.58 --> 1179.81
[Music]

1186.65 --> 1193.3190000000002
[Music]

1206.539 --> 1210.2
anyway

1208.66 --> 1213.6200000000001
[Music]

1210.2 --> 1216.26
that's what I've been doing

1213.62 --> 1218.1789999999999
and that movie is freaking long too by

1216.26 --> 1219.679
the way like two hours and 20 minutes

1218.179 --> 1221.9
Jesus

1219.679 --> 1224.24
or maybe that's just an extended version

1221.9 --> 1226.1000000000001
or something but I did think it was

1224.24 --> 1229.72
really long I couldn't watch it in one

1226.1 --> 1229.7199999999998
go it was just too long

1230.08 --> 1234.5
[Music]

1231.44 --> 1236.3600000000001
and it's really bizarre like oh it's

1234.5 --> 1240.26
that long is it

1236.36 --> 1242.4799999999998
uh but yet you just switch to like oh

1240.26 --> 1244.82
everybody put in armor you're going to

1242.48 --> 1248.539
be a general now from one scene to the

1244.82 --> 1251.1789999999999
other a but two two hours and 20 minutes

1248.539 --> 1252.08
you couldn't actually like build up to

1251.179 --> 1254.48
that

1252.08 --> 1256.6399999999999
get a little realistic like maybe they

1254.48 --> 1259.34
need some training or something

1256.64 --> 1261.3200000000002
some act more extensive training instead

1259.34 --> 1263.84
of just like oh I'm picking up the sword

1261.32 --> 1265.05
I'm swinging it oh now I'm can I'm a

1263.84 --> 1268.99
sword fighter now

1265.05 --> 1268.99
[Music]

1269.539 --> 1272.559
I mean yeah

1273.559 --> 1278.78
I I just

1276.38 --> 1280.94
I just didn't like the movie I actually

1278.78 --> 1284.059
just didn't like it

1280.94 --> 1287.179
it was very aesthetically pleasing

1284.059 --> 1288.32
and the characters were interesting and

1287.179 --> 1290.9
Lively

1288.32 --> 1292.46
I just did not like the movie

1290.9 --> 1296.179
it's like

1292.46 --> 1298.8400000000001
a good crew but a bad game master and it

1296.179 --> 1298.8400000000001
just sucks

1299.36 --> 1304.9599999999998
because if the game master sucks then

1301.58 --> 1304.96
the story sucks

1307.46 --> 1312.159
and I don't know if that is because of

1309.44 --> 1312.159
C.S Lewis

1312.86 --> 1318.82
that he was just not like a

1315.82 --> 1320.96
focused on like

1318.82 --> 1322.76
realistic story

1320.96 --> 1325.52
even though it's about a fantasy land

1322.76 --> 1328.28
right it's just I didn't I just didn't

1325.52 --> 1333.4
like it I I have to say it I don't like

1328.28 --> 1333.3999999999999
it I don't like it just don't like it

1343.99 --> 1349.4
[Music]

1346.88 --> 1351.6200000000001
but maybe I'll like it more in the

1349.4 --> 1354.0800000000002
second movie

1351.62 --> 1356.36
when they're gonna expound a little more

1354.08 --> 1358.039
on the ancient magic and and all the

1356.36 --> 1359.6
rules because that part was kind of

1358.039 --> 1362.0
interesting

1359.6 --> 1364.4189999999999
what movie Chronicles of Narnia the

1362.0 --> 1364.419
first one

1365.059 --> 1370.94
I watched it yesterday fully for the

1367.64 --> 1374.179
first time and I just didn't like it

1370.94 --> 1376.5800000000002
it annoyed me exactly the same way as it

1374.179 --> 1378.799
did before

1376.58 --> 1382.4189999999999
and

1378.799 --> 1382.4189999999999
time to avoid Disney

1385.82 --> 1390.559
but

1387.5 --> 1393.74
with just some slight alterations it

1390.559 --> 1396.26
could like there would be no problem

1393.74 --> 1399.32
I mean if they just had a better build

1396.26 --> 1403.22
up to actually becoming Generals in a

1399.32 --> 1405.5
war and knowing War like some some small

1403.22 --> 1407.6000000000001
battle some actual battles where they

1405.5 --> 1411.02
themselves fight and not just one time

1407.6 --> 1413.78
but where they actually like go at it

1411.02 --> 1418.76
if that has been added onto it I'd be

1413.78 --> 1422.26
like yeah okay now now I can kind of get

1418.76 --> 1422.26
into that that might happen

1422.93 --> 1430.48
[Music]

1427.159 --> 1434.6000000000001
right unless they make it

1430.48 --> 1436.22
very overt that it's like oh they're

1434.6 --> 1437.9599999999998
magical weapons they kind of look

1436.22 --> 1440.96
magical what they got and they were

1437.96 --> 1444.5
special for them but then like oh when

1440.96 --> 1447.44
you use it you gain the spirit of a king

1444.5 --> 1450.26
and then you become that warlord right

1447.44 --> 1452.72
if that was overtly stated then it'd be

1450.26 --> 1456.44
like oh okay it's kind of kind of cheesy

1452.72 --> 1457.82
maybe but yeah I have the power and then

1456.44 --> 1460.5800000000002
there

1457.82 --> 1463.1589999999999
then they're like yeah King mode or

1460.58 --> 1464.6
something whatever then it yeah then I'd

1463.159 --> 1466.88
be like okay

1464.6 --> 1468.9189999999999
but now it's like oh oh yeah you just

1466.88 --> 1472.3400000000001
gotta run a war you have to do it

1468.919 --> 1474.919
because we we you're in the prophecy and

1472.34 --> 1476.48
like the [ __ ] dude that's not how it

1474.919 --> 1478.5800000000002
works ever

1476.48 --> 1482.08
like that's not even how it works in my

1478.58 --> 1482.08
dreams it's ridiculous

1487.12 --> 1494.559
yeah that just annoyed me

1491.24 --> 1494.559
like a lot

1501.559 --> 1504.82
are you seeing star water

1505.159 --> 1509.419
do you cannot judge yeah no but I'm

1507.32 --> 1511.3999999999999
saying that I'm talking about the movie

1509.419 --> 1514.3400000000001
specifically I'm not talking about the

1511.4 --> 1516.919
book I mean I bet the book is

1514.34 --> 1520.1
very pleasant to read

1516.919 --> 1522.0800000000002
I bet he's a very good writer

1520.1 --> 1524.12
because that

1522.08 --> 1526.52
rubs off

1524.12 --> 1528.4399999999998
like on the movie itself I mean if a

1526.52 --> 1530.86
book is really good and it'll have such

1528.44 --> 1533.299
details that that will simply be

1530.86 --> 1536.059
assimilated into the movie and then they

1533.299 --> 1538.94
screw up in another way perhaps but

1536.059 --> 1541.1589999999999
yeah I bet that the original book is

1538.94 --> 1542.539
just really good it's a really good read

1541.159 --> 1544.5200000000002
I bet

1542.539 --> 1547.279
not that I'm gonna read it

1544.52 --> 1549.5
but the movie I just did not like it

1547.279 --> 1552.039
even though it was very aesthetically

1549.5 --> 1552.039
pleasing

1558.6 --> 1561.7199999999998
[Music]

1573.74 --> 1576.34
huh

1577.32 --> 1586.359
[Music]

1599.32 --> 1604.34
[Music]

1601.88 --> 1606.6200000000001
anyway

1604.34 --> 1609.279
thought that was an item worth

1606.62 --> 1609.279
discussing

1641.539 --> 1647.98
right anyway that's pretty much it for

1644.179 --> 1647.98
my day I did not go to bed late

1648.02 --> 1651.6399999999999
actually quite early again

1653.21 --> 1656.63
[Music]

1668.72 --> 1673.6000000000001
I can join you soon what are you talking

1671.36 --> 1673.6
about

1689.08 --> 1695.539
oh okay Nathan but just so you know uh

1693.5 --> 1699.039
my show is still gonna go for another

1695.539 --> 1699.039
hour and 12 minutes

1699.679 --> 1704.3200000000002
time has shifted I hope you took notice

1701.96 --> 1704.32
of that

1719.419 --> 1725.2990000000002
I thought my day was done no I don't

1722.0 --> 1729.7
know no everything is an hour later or

1725.299 --> 1729.7
did you not notice this Nathan come on

1730.1 --> 1732.82
foreign

1737.539 --> 1742.64
no my day was done

1739.82 --> 1745.96
concerning like discussing my day

1742.64 --> 1745.96
yesterday what I did

1746.24 --> 1750.82
watch Chronicles of Narnia the first one

1752.659 --> 1755.8600000000001
a bunch of live streams

1758.36 --> 1760.899
huh

1762.44 --> 1765.8200000000002
that's right Derek

1783.32 --> 1786.32
anyway

1786.74 --> 1793.299
I'm up for discussing whatever

1790.039 --> 1793.299
so bring it on

1801.799 --> 1808.34
any feedback on my

1804.94 --> 1810.8200000000002
Drive-In private space project as I now

1808.34 --> 1810.82
called it

1818.53 --> 1821.77
[Music]

1823.52 --> 1830.0
yeah PJ CNET that's all lies

1827.0 --> 1832.399
that's overt lies I mean

1830.0 --> 1836.14
there's already been like investigations

1832.399 --> 1836.1399999999999
it's exactly the opposite

1836.779 --> 1844.88
the guy was like full-on LGBT activist

1840.919 --> 1848.3600000000001
and [ __ ] it's a total horseshit

1844.88 --> 1850.659
in your face 180 degree lie all that

1848.36 --> 1850.6589999999999
[ __ ]

1850.7 --> 1856.7
and the whole thing was super bizarre

1854.539 --> 1860.48
did you know that apparently when they

1856.7 --> 1863.659
called in an emergency that they said

1860.48 --> 1866.419
that he was a friend

1863.659 --> 1870.2600000000002
like the whole thing is freaking insane

1866.419 --> 1873.0800000000002
there's no video footage of it

1870.26 --> 1876.94
it sounds like there's a really

1873.08 --> 1881.02
like shady Shady thingy happening

1876.94 --> 1881.02
something really shady happened

1885.2 --> 1890.659
I mean I could like conspiracize

1888.02 --> 1891.86
this is the conspiracy theorize the [ __ ]

1890.659 --> 1894.2
out of it

1891.86 --> 1897.5
and go as far as to say like yeah maybe

1894.2 --> 1901.059
Nancy Pelosi actually made a deal

1897.5 --> 1901.059
with that guy like

1902.0 --> 1904.659
Maybe

1911.6 --> 1913.779
right

1918.38 --> 1924.14
it it has the stink of a self-inflicted

1922.22 --> 1927.58
wound a lot

1924.14 --> 1927.5800000000002
a lot of that stink

1928.13 --> 1940.14
[Music]

1941.12 --> 1944.12
foreign

1951.58 --> 1955.0
what the hell

1956.74 --> 1963.3990000000001
okay where the hell are you getting that

1959.96 --> 1963.3990000000001
from flatter Sage

1970.52 --> 1974.72
right and if the FBI stormed

1972.799 --> 1977.6589999999999
observatories then it's probably because

1974.72 --> 1979.88
they found ciao part in there

1977.659 --> 1983.5390000000002
wanna bet

1979.88 --> 1986.0590000000002
wanna bet a lot of money that I'm

1983.539 --> 1987.44
calling it straight on the nose and

1986.059 --> 1988.8799999999999
that's the reason why they don't want to

1987.44 --> 1992.48
talk about it

1988.88 --> 1995.3600000000001
they probably found freaking child porn

1992.48 --> 1997.6
like in the observatory databases and

1995.36 --> 1997.6
[ __ ]

1997.7 --> 2000.659
not joking

2003.519 --> 2009.94
sounds like a really good reason not to

2006.22 --> 2014.26
mention why you did it right

2009.94 --> 2016.539
for an organization like NASA

2014.26 --> 2017.98

2040.48 --> 2047.98
annoying nonsense block maybe it's like

2043.299 --> 2051.159
oh oh we have to rate them because they

2047.98 --> 2055.3
spotted the secrets

2051.159 --> 2058.78
the high orbit military base

2055.3 --> 2061.3
blah blah oh they spotted something that

2058.78 --> 2063.5800000000004
they shouldn't have quickly raid them

2061.3 --> 2067.3590000000004
and delete all their data and now of

2063.58 --> 2070.06
course it's all complete horshit because

2067.359 --> 2072.639
there is no such thing

2070.06 --> 2074.7999999999997
but that might be an easy way to kind of

2072.639 --> 2077.379
like seed

2074.8 --> 2081.54
suspicion like oh they saw something

2077.379 --> 2084.889
that they were not supposed to in space

[Music]

2085.06 --> 2091.7799999999997
maybe they got a glimpse of the secret

2088.179 --> 2093.04
moon base somehow now just no never mind

2091.78 --> 2095.98
it's

2093.04 --> 2097.359
something really [ __ ] stupid it could

2095.98 --> 2099.52
be that

2097.359 --> 2101.619
like a setup

2099.52 --> 2104.32
or it's like they found child porn on

2101.619 --> 2105.94
the computers there and

2104.32 --> 2108.7200000000003
yeah

2105.94 --> 2108.7200000000003
either way

2114.099 --> 2118.5
something far more down to earth

2118.619 --> 2122.4
so like what

2127.66 --> 2132.16
instead of just immediately saying no

2130.599 --> 2134.46
it's something else why don't you

2132.16 --> 2137.2599999999998
actually say what

2134.46 --> 2140.2200000000003
orenakowomo instead of coming in and

2137.26 --> 2140.2200000000003
just saying no

2147.099 --> 2153.52
right oh so it is that thing that I

2150.76 --> 2155.619
mentioned then Orinoco one more

2153.52 --> 2158.68
because I literally mentioned that

2155.619 --> 2162.0
before the ridiculous idea that they

2158.68 --> 2162.0
might have seen something in space

2173.8 --> 2177.1800000000003
right so yeah

2177.82 --> 2182.56
I already made that bet right verbally

2180.52 --> 2186.78
about you a lot of money was child porn

2182.56 --> 2186.7799999999997
well guess what I'm already proven right

2204.339 --> 2212.7599999999998

2219.22 --> 2225.7799999999997
I mean like 200 percent more

2222.82 --> 2225.78
so

2256.359 --> 2261.7599999999998
really why didn't you just immediately

2259.06 --> 2263.14
say no it actually was child born why

2261.76 --> 2265.0600000000004
didn't you just say that if you already

2263.14 --> 2267.22
knew it why didn't you just say that why

2265.06 --> 2272.44
didn't you just immediately say the

2267.22 --> 2276.5789999999997
point yeah the point get to the point

2272.44 --> 2279.2200000000003
always immediately get to the point no

immediately no stalling no oh no it's

not that now just say it immediately

2384.88 --> 2392.56
YouTube you are just technically failing

2389.579 --> 2395.8

I have a channel specific Channel

2395.8 --> 2401.32
specific chat blocked word pedo

2408.64 --> 2410.8199999999997
through

2412.3 --> 2417.4
unless it's a lot no it isn't it is it

2415.119 --> 2420.54
shouldn't even be allowed by mods

2417.4 --> 2420.54
just by anyone

2420.7 --> 2424.02
he spelled it wrong no

2428.859 --> 2434.38
it's literally that word

2432.04 --> 2437.2599999999998
no it's not with EA

2434.38 --> 2440.02
that nobody spells it with the a or in

spelled like that originally nobody ever

does that

I'm just gonna kick out immediately

2460.96 --> 2466.3
that's the British spelling right so

2463.54 --> 2469.92
nobody says it like that done

the point is is that this one word

2469.92 --> 2476.619
exactly that word exactly as he wrote it

2473.8 --> 2479.1400000000003
down there is on the block list it

2476.619 --> 2481.7200000000003
shouldn't have come through why the [ __ ]

2479.14 --> 2483.2799999999997
did that blocked word come through I

exemption to it

alright so yeah please don't use that

2521.02 --> 2523.2

2604.31 --> 2607.54
[Music]

2611.619 --> 2615.78
deep privatize YouTube

2615.88 --> 2621.099
take it out of their hands these

2621.099 --> 2625.0

I am complaining to YouTube I'm

2636.28 --> 2641.1600000000003
complaining right now to YouTube right

2638.92 --> 2641.16
now

2644.2 --> 2646.9199999999996
foreign

2654.359 --> 2659.14
works great

2657.46 --> 2661.92
surprising

2659.14 --> 2661.92
surprisingly

2662.859 --> 2666.04
because it hasn't been updated for over

2664.78 --> 2668.619
a year

2666.04 --> 2671.16
oh one and a half year

2668.619 --> 2671.1600000000003
so

2671.5 --> 2675.48
but doesn't really seem to matter

2676.0 --> 2678.359
anyway

2689.2 --> 2692.5
yeah

2690.22 --> 2693.839
and why do I work block the word

2692.5 --> 2696.4
pedophile

2693.839 --> 2699.94
Peto why do you think

2696.4 --> 2702.7000000000003
it's because if I if I would be exposing

2699.94 --> 2704.619
myself to it I would fly into murderous

2702.7 --> 2707.02
fits of Rage

2704.619 --> 2709.839
because I think that all petos should be

2707.02 --> 2714.06
slaughtered not even executed is not

2709.839 --> 2714.06
even the right word for it slaughtered

2732.28 --> 2736.5400000000004
right and I don't want to go to that

2735.16 --> 2739.359
place

2736.54 --> 2741.94
so that's why I don't bring it up and

2739.359 --> 2745.18
that's why I had it in the block list

2741.94 --> 2748.48
so this is a grave offense to me from

2745.18 --> 2751.06
YouTube for enabling that word that I

2748.48 --> 2754.06
specifically put in the block list to be

2751.06 --> 2757.619
used in my chat

2754.06 --> 2757.619
that is an offense to me

2763.06 --> 2767.7
and has nothing to do with my freaking

2765.099 --> 2767.7000000000003
browser

2770.14 --> 2772.92
anyway

2797.079 --> 2801.94
is the block list for both chat and

2800.44 --> 2803.619
comments

2801.94 --> 2808.14
I'm not sure

2803.619 --> 2808.1400000000003
it should be for the YouTube chat

2809.8 --> 2814.92
I don't know about the comments probably

2811.839 --> 2814.92
the comments too

2853.599 --> 2856.44
weird

2861.46 --> 2866.56
that's that's not exactly what I wanted

2864.04 --> 2870.4
out of it

2866.56 --> 2872.56
why can't I just say every nobody can

2870.4 --> 2875.56
use this word

2872.56 --> 2877.54
don't want a block word except for

2875.56 --> 2880.48

2877.54 --> 2883.54
that's just a blocked word for everyone

2880.48 --> 2886.2400000000002
always why the hell is there

2883.54 --> 2888.7
automatically an exemption for anybody

who has a wrench that defeats the whole

at least some people that don't have

2944.38 --> 2948.2200000000003
wrenches can

2945.819 --> 2950.8
I'm still just annoyed right why can't

2948.22 --> 2953.3799999999997
just a word be universally blocked why

2950.8 --> 2956.5
does it automatically give an exemption

2953.38 --> 2959.1600000000003
to to moderators for using that

2956.5 --> 2959.16
the [ __ ]

2962.319 --> 2968.2
it doesn't matter if it's handed out to

2965.319 --> 2972.7
trusted users

2968.2 --> 2975.46
that's not real not influenced by it

2972.7 --> 2977.9199999999996
I just don't want that word to be used

2975.46 --> 2980.319
in my chat by anybody

2977.92 --> 2982.7400000000002
doesn't matter if they're trusted users

2980.319 --> 2982.74
or not

2995.2 --> 2999.16
right I mean how hard can it be to just

2997.839 --> 3002.5789999999997
have

2999.16 --> 3006.1189999999997
two block lists or like one

3002.579 --> 3010.8
clickable box that just says like

3006.119 --> 3014.4
yeah word like moderators get exception

3010.8 --> 3016.92
or don't get exception right I mean how

3014.4 --> 3019.14
hard is this this is like

3016.92 --> 3020.64
five minutes work for the freaking

3019.14 --> 3023.52
programmer

3020.64 --> 3027.18
and maybe some update

3023.52 --> 3031.319
rumbling that's a lot tougher but

3027.18 --> 3034.7999999999997
I mean it's really simple really really

3031.319 --> 3037.14
simple to insert that in there

3034.8 --> 3040.079
all right either that or you just have

3037.14 --> 3042.859
two boxes one is like

3040.079 --> 3042.8590000000004
words

3043.2 --> 3048.1189999999997
that are blocked except for moderators

3045.72 --> 3050.52
and work that are always blocked

3048.119 --> 3052.619
right if you just have two boxes I mean

3050.52 --> 3054.66
there's already like four boxes in that

3052.619 --> 3058.77
menu

3054.66 --> 3061.98
so why not add another one I don't know

3058.77 --> 3065.04
[Music]

3061.98 --> 3068.579
there's no such thing as a 5B now the

3065.04 --> 3070.619
actual programming lonely only lonely it

3068.579 --> 3073.619
is just five minutes work I mean

3070.619 --> 3076.1400000000003
the implementation and the updating yeah

3073.619 --> 3078.2400000000002
that's more tiresome takes more time and

3076.14 --> 3081.0589999999997
more Personnel but the actual

3078.24 --> 3083.2999999999997
programming of just adding like a little

3081.059 --> 3086.579
piece of text

3083.3 --> 3089.4
in what is it in the programming

3086.579 --> 3091.619
language it's not a lot of work

3089.4 --> 3096.059
it really is it's probably just like

3091.619 --> 3098.579
copy paste alter a couple of sentences

3096.059 --> 3101.78
playing done

3098.579 --> 3101.78
five minutes work

3102.599 --> 3108.48
but then you have to implement the

3105.059 --> 3111.3
updates and that is more costly time

3108.48 --> 3114.48
wise and people

3111.3 --> 3117.599
so usually they just Heap it up

3114.48 --> 3118.98
and then they do an update and then all

you know it's probably gonna turn out to

3575.4 --> 3579.48
be pretty damn neutral

3577.619 --> 3580.7400000000002
is my prediction it's going to be

3579.48 --> 3582.839
neutral

3580.74 --> 3584.3999999999996
he's gonna be okay it's gonna be

that is gonna happen

you should probably be glad of it

instead of getting more and more

3598.799 --> 3605.839

and more things you want to say

3614.4 --> 3622.26
excuse no he's just rearranging Twitter

3619.859 --> 3626.0989999999997
he's not gonna bring back anything he's

3622.26 --> 3630.8590000000004
not a world ruler he's just a social

3638.28 --> 3641.28

well when they do maybe you should just

3685.68 --> 3692.0989999999997
be glad for a change instead of

4091.339 --> 4096.0199999999995
taking the real spiritual responsibility

4093.859 --> 4099.5
that you should take

4096.02 --> 4101.120000000001
yeah if you get government money from a

4099.5 --> 4102.5
community like the smaller the

4101.12 --> 4105.44
government the more important this

4102.5 --> 4106.759
becomes because the more percentile wise

4105.44 --> 4108.739
you're taking

4106.759 --> 4112.779
if you take something

4108.739 --> 4118.2789999999995
you must give something in return not

4112.779 --> 4120.56
what they say you should do not like you

4118.279 --> 4122.120000000001
know oh you get money you must do this

4120.56 --> 4125.54
and that now [ __ ] that that's

4122.12 --> 4128.839
authoritarian yeah no that's not the

4125.54 --> 4132.56
case but you should have an inner

4128.839 --> 4134.299
spiritual duty to want to do something

4132.56 --> 4137.900000000001
back for the world

4134.299 --> 4141.799
to give back from what you got it would

4137.9 --> 4145.46
be your civil Duty yeah

4141.799 --> 4148.339
now that a socialism that is Guided by

4145.46 --> 4152.299
such sentiments such way of doing things

4148.339 --> 4155.839
is great everybody has civil Duty

4152.299 --> 4158.44
responsibility nobody's forcing anybody

4155.839 --> 4161.719
to do anything they just feel

4158.44 --> 4164.54
responsible to give something back for

4161.719 --> 4167.839
what they gotten unconditionally yeah

4164.54 --> 4169.819
now that's a good socialist system

4167.839 --> 4173.48
or everybody has their personal

4169.819 --> 4176.120000000001
responsibility and the nationalism is

4173.48 --> 4178.218999999999
very important for that oh no I said it

4176.12 --> 4181.64
yeah national socialism yeah yeah yeah

4178.219 --> 4184.719
the good one the good thing yeah the

4181.64 --> 4186.92
good version before it became

4184.719 --> 4189.92
militarized and some [ __ ]

4186.92 --> 4192.14
polarization situation with oh no our

4189.92 --> 4193.9400000000005
people are the special boys and these

4192.14 --> 4196.9400000000005
are just trash we need to get rid of

4193.94 --> 4200.0
them leaving them yeah that sucks

4196.94 --> 4202.5199999999995
and has nothing to do it per default

4200.0 --> 4205.699
with national socialism national

4202.52 --> 4208.160000000001
socialism is a great system where

4205.699 --> 4212.0
everybody's basically taken care of and

4208.16 --> 4214.099999999999
then they from The Roots up they should

4212.0 --> 4215.54
be taught by family should be taught by

4214.1 --> 4217.52
your neighborhood you have a

4215.54 --> 4219.34
responsibility to give something back

4217.52 --> 4222.9800000000005
now that doesn't be

4219.34 --> 4227.78
stop having welfare get a job you dumb

4222.98 --> 4230.0
bum no it means that you try to fake get

4227.78 --> 4232.099999999999
take that room

4230.0 --> 4234.38
of that welfare

4232.1 --> 4236.719
get your Affairs in order to figure out

4234.38 --> 4239.659000000001
who you are figure out your talents and

4236.719 --> 4243.38
then try to apply your talents

4239.659 --> 4246.62
hopefully for the betterment of your

4243.38 --> 4249.56
direct surrounding

4246.62 --> 4251.12
people of your country and maybe even

4249.56 --> 4252.9800000000005
the world

4251.12 --> 4256.219
but especially the people of your

4252.98 --> 4259.159
country right you should represent in a

4256.219 --> 4263.2390000000005
socialist system and nationalism is a

4259.159 --> 4265.099999999999
great way to kind of give it Direction

4263.239 --> 4266.9
because then it's like yeah your nation

4265.1 --> 4268.34
provide for you now what will you do

4266.9 --> 4271.339999999999
back for your nation

4268.34 --> 4273.9800000000005
yeah it doesn't that sound incredibly

4271.34 --> 4275.84
sensible it almost sounds a bit American

4273.98 --> 4278.32
would you say

4275.84 --> 4278.32
right

4279.98 --> 4284.12
it's like yeah of course you're not

4281.84 --> 4285.5
gonna let these people just starve that

4284.12 --> 4286.699
would be indecent that would be

4285.5 --> 4289.159
unchristian

4286.699 --> 4289.94
but if you're gonna help them out you

4289.159 --> 4294.62
should

4289.94 --> 4296.299999999999
expect them to be thankful and give

4294.62 --> 4298.28
something back do their best to do

4296.3 --> 4301.400000000001
something back and to at least not be

4298.28 --> 4304.4
criminal to not bother other people and

4301.4 --> 4306.0199999999995
if you're maybe good at it help figure

4304.4 --> 4309.62
out Solutions

4306.02 --> 4313.42
develop your talent yeah and then a

4309.62 --> 4313.42
socialist system works great

4313.82 --> 4319.04
the problem with socialist systems comes

4316.76 --> 4320.6
very specifically that's when the

4319.04 --> 4322.5199999999995
Marxism sets in

4320.6 --> 4323.54
when people just don't give a [ __ ]

4322.52 --> 4325.1
anymore

4323.54 --> 4327.38
why

4325.1 --> 4329.06
maybe because there's a really corrupted

4327.38 --> 4331.159000000001
piece of [ __ ] in government that just

4329.06 --> 4333.620000000001
makes them lose trust in their

4331.159 --> 4335.299999999999
government and then think well I hate

4333.62 --> 4339.5599999999995
this government I'm not going to do

4335.3 --> 4341.42
anything now because it might help them

4339.56 --> 4344.900000000001
now of course you shouldn't just roll

4341.42 --> 4346.52
into their schemes and [ __ ]

4344.9 --> 4348.98
but that doesn't mean that you should

4346.52 --> 4352.1
then give up on the rest of the people

4348.98 --> 4354.5
and that's the real problem

4352.1 --> 4357.04
with socialism is that as soon as really

4354.5 --> 4360.5
corrupted people get in there they

4357.04 --> 4364.219
demoralize that essential

4360.5 --> 4366.8
spirit that moralizing spirit that needs

4364.219 --> 4369.26
to be there in socialism for it to work

4366.8 --> 4371.0
because if everybody gets demoralized

4369.26 --> 4373.46
they're like yeah [ __ ] this country it's

4371.0 --> 4375.92
all [ __ ] now these corrupted pieces of

4373.46 --> 4377.78
[ __ ] like why would I do anything well

4375.92 --> 4380.78
if everybody starts thinking that in a

4377.78 --> 4385.04
socialist country it immediately very

4380.78 --> 4387.5599999999995
rapidly goes to hell and I mean hell

4385.04 --> 4389.659
because if everybody sadly becomes like

4387.56 --> 4392.360000000001
I don't want to do anything anymore

4389.659 --> 4394.219
then like everything is going to shut

4392.36 --> 4397.4
down

4394.219 --> 4400.0
because everybody is needed to keep

4397.4 --> 4400.0
things going

4400.04 --> 4405.739
you see

4402.679 --> 4408.46
so now I have an item that I talked

4405.739 --> 4408.459999999999
about for a bit

4412.34 --> 4418.900000000001
all you need to do is just keep saying

4415.04 --> 4423.14
things in chat just keep it going don't

4418.9 --> 4427.12
[ __ ] have five minutes of silence

4423.14 --> 4427.12
it pisses me off

lead Humanity to Mars well what does

4450.62 --> 4456.5
that even that steamy traveler that just

4452.84 --> 4458.92
sounds like a piece of at occultism to

4456.5 --> 4461.54
me yeah

4458.92 --> 4463.34
what that basically says to me literally

4461.54 --> 4466.34
what you're just saying there

4463.34 --> 4468.14
Von Brown doesn't say

4466.34 --> 4471.56
oh it doesn't say that a person named

4468.14 --> 4474.62
would become you would lead Humanity to

4471.56 --> 4478.159000000001
Mars but rather that the name of the

4474.62 --> 4480.76
leader's position would be Elon

4478.159 --> 4480.759999999999
what

4488.44 --> 4493.0
I don't know that just seems [ __ ]

4500.659 --> 4506.199
foreign

4502.12 --> 4506.199
that just sounds [ __ ]

4506.84 --> 4511.64
the name of the lit that's that's not

4509.659 --> 4514.099999999999
even saying anything that could

4511.64 --> 4516.4400000000005
literally mean that he just wanted to

4514.1 --> 4518.900000000001
prank the entire world by making a

4516.44 --> 4521.299999999999
prediction the name of the world leader

4518.9 --> 4524.719
will be Elon so that everybody just

4521.3 --> 4528.7390000000005
starts to name their freaking kids Elon

4524.719 --> 4530.719
I mean that's it that is it

4528.739 --> 4534.919999999999
that is all

4530.719 --> 4537.08
what the [ __ ] does any of that even mean

4534.92 --> 4539.6
you know I mean if it would have been

4537.08 --> 4541.1
specific enough to say oh yeah oh

4539.6 --> 4543.620000000001
there's a man named Elon would lead

4541.1 --> 4545.5
Humanity to Mars well that's an app

4543.62 --> 4548.9
actual prediction

4545.5 --> 4551.48
it's a weird prediction

4548.9 --> 4555.0199999999995
and it could be very interpreted as

4551.48 --> 4558.379999999999
esoteric meaning War yeah Mars being

4555.02 --> 4560.2390000000005
literally like the symbol of War so Elon

4558.38 --> 4562.219
would lead us to war okay that would be

4560.239 --> 4565.759999999999
an actual prediction

4562.219 --> 4568.64
but saying the leader will be called

4565.76 --> 4571.96
Elon that's just [ __ ]

4568.64 --> 4571.96
I mean seriously

4572.06 --> 4577.3
are there a lot of elons in the world

4574.1 --> 4577.3
well I bet they are now

4577.82 --> 4584.78
I mean with Elon Musk being all the the

4580.88 --> 4586.46
rocket scientist popular figure yeah of

4584.78 --> 4589.34
course there's gonna be thousands and

4586.46 --> 4591.44
thousands of kids now named Elon

4589.34 --> 4592.9400000000005
guaranteed

4591.44 --> 4595.96
thousands

4592.94 --> 4595.96

4611.9 --> 4617.719
Elon didn't start Tesla mode I I don't

4614.48 --> 4620.78
even know what Elon started at all

4617.719 --> 4623.179
you didn't start anything

4620.78 --> 4625.94
didn't start Paypal didn't start Tesla

4623.179 --> 4628.4

4625.94 --> 4630.139999999999
SpaceX he supposedly really started

4628.4 --> 4631.759999999999
maybe that's the one thing he did

4630.14 --> 4636.1
actually start

4631.76 --> 4636.1
but I don't think he's started anything

4636.56 --> 4641.120000000001
I don't think he's like a guy of

4638.48 --> 4642.218999999999
original ideas really I think he's more

4641.12 --> 4646.84
of a

4642.219 --> 4646.84
popular type businessman

4646.94 --> 4653.199
right he doesn't create new markets

4655.04 --> 4662.08
he just buys up stuff

4657.86 --> 4662.08
and then tries to do something with it

4663.62 --> 4669.62
part of verbic theater yeah the big

4667.1 --> 4672.56
theater really foreign or is he just

4669.62 --> 4675.5199999999995
part of a theater maybe it's his theater

4672.56 --> 4678.4400000000005
maybe it's the Elon Musk the popular

4675.52 --> 4680.4800000000005
businessman theater have you ever

4678.44 --> 4682.78
thought of that that it's just his

4680.48 --> 4682.78
theater

4688.699 --> 4695.5599999999995
yeah I know he's originally from South

4691.219 --> 4695.56
Africa what you didn't know that

4704.78 --> 4710.44
Elon sleeps all day he does okay

4713.239 --> 4719.739
yeah I know he's born a rich man's son I

4717.5 --> 4719.739
know

4722.38 --> 4727.1
he is controlled all right so where's

4725.54 --> 4729.8
the proof for that

4727.1 --> 4733.179
what's your proof gear shifter

4729.8 --> 4733.179
who's controlling him

4739.659 --> 4744.4
didn't know he co-founded paper he

4742.219 --> 4744.4
didn't

4746.679 --> 4753.4
he says he is but he isn't

4750.32 --> 4753.4
it's just a lie

4753.679 --> 4760.4800000000005
somebody else founded it and then he

4756.8 --> 4760.4800000000005
went into business with them

4762.679 --> 4767.02
became partner he did not found it

4990.92 --> 4995.36
well we should have both but yeah online

4993.739 --> 4999.339999999999

5003.04 --> 5008.98
rid of Cash ever

5031.42 --> 5036.04
there must be

5033.4 --> 5037.719
human Representatives that you can

5036.04 --> 5041.26
interact with

5037.719 --> 5043.44
that will represent the bank it's just a

5041.26 --> 5043.4400000000005
must

5043.719 --> 5049.9
so I I would prefer if brick and mortar

5046.96 --> 5052.42
Banks as you call them would still be

5049.9 --> 5055.12
there I mean I don't expect them to be

5052.42 --> 5056.7390000000005
everywhere around every street corner

5055.12 --> 5059.08
but

5056.739 --> 5061.0
it would be great if they'd still just

5059.08 --> 5062.32
be around

5061.0 --> 5064.96
I mean

5062.32 --> 5066.94
like for example what the [ __ ] if your

5064.96 --> 5070.3
internet just goes down and you don't

5066.94 --> 5072.94
have a mobile phone

5070.3 --> 5076.900000000001
or your computer breaks right

5072.94 --> 5078.94
and you don't have any way to just like

5076.9 --> 5082.139999999999
digitally transfer money or something

5078.94 --> 5084.94
this [ __ ] can happen

5082.14 --> 5087.46
it's important that you could still just

5084.94 --> 5091.12
get cash

5087.46 --> 5094.199
or arrange things without without being

5091.12 --> 5094.199
forced to do it digitally

5123.64 --> 5130.780000000001
one cash point left me right

5127.54 --> 5133.36
well I think there should be these cash

5130.78 --> 5134.5599999999995
in points and they are usually at Banks

5133.36 --> 5137.0199999999995
right

5134.56 --> 5139.120000000001
well maybe they could like there's a

5137.02 --> 5141.46
cash machine maybe they can just have

5139.12 --> 5142.719
those machines where you literally put

5141.46 --> 5145.12
the money in

5142.719 --> 5148.659
in a similar way

5145.12 --> 5150.88
that you have cash machines which you

5148.659 --> 5154.54
can get cash from your bank using your

5150.88 --> 5158.26
card but also where you can literally do

5154.54 --> 5160.6
cash in where you can put the coins and

5158.26 --> 5163.3
the papers in there

5160.6 --> 5165.46
to actually deposit it

5163.3 --> 5168.88
wouldn't that be great

5165.46 --> 5171.159
if that was just standardized with like

5168.88 --> 5174.76
cash machines

5171.159 --> 5176.679
the ATMs right this is what it's called

5174.76 --> 5179.139
if you just had a standard function

5176.679 --> 5182.679
where you could also just

5179.139 --> 5185.639
like drop your cash to deposit it on

5182.679 --> 5185.639
your account instead

5187.42 --> 5192.52
and if you've standardized that then

5190.179 --> 5195.34
yeah then you'll never have that issue

5192.52 --> 5196.719
there's only one cash drop off point and

5195.34 --> 5199.06
it's closed

5196.719 --> 5201.04
because that will just ruin

5199.06 --> 5203.580000000001
everything

5201.04 --> 5203.58
anyway

5204.76 --> 5211.679
biometric identification from money

5206.98 --> 5211.678999999999
transfers well I hope not that's absurd

5216.28 --> 5223.0599999999995
I mean seriously that is absurd and I

5219.94 --> 5225.54
guarantee as soon as like the second

5223.06 --> 5229.7390000000005
they've implemented it

5225.54 --> 5234.4
immediately it will be used by criminals

5229.739 --> 5239.08
immediately they will get that biometric

5234.4 --> 5241.96
data extremely quickly get lenses get

5239.08 --> 5243.1
finger things and just start robbing the

5241.96 --> 5245.8
place

5243.1 --> 5247.360000000001
without anybody even realizing it until

5245.8 --> 5249.88
it's too late

5247.36 --> 5252.159
without having to blow anything up

5249.88 --> 5255.46
without having to mug anybody they could

5252.159 --> 5257.129999999999
just plunder the [ __ ] out of the place

5255.46 --> 5258.639
very quickly

5257.13 --> 5260.7390000000005
[Music]

5258.639 --> 5265.84
because all this [ __ ] biometric

5260.739 --> 5267.099999999999
nonsense is extremely easily falsified

5265.84 --> 5269.7390000000005
like

5267.1 --> 5270.84
it just doesn't work

5269.739 --> 5274.12
like

5270.84 --> 5278.32
falsification technology has caught up

5274.12 --> 5280.78
too quickly it just doesn't work at all

5278.32 --> 5283.0599999999995
just keep it the way it is

5280.78 --> 5285.5199999999995
I mean I think that like

5283.06 --> 5287.56
code confirmation systems and all that

5285.52 --> 5289.540000000001
are pretty good

5287.56 --> 5291.46
right

5289.54 --> 5294.34
somebody might try to hack into your

5291.46 --> 5296.38
bank and they'll be onto it quickly but

5294.34 --> 5298.96
they can't because anytime you want to

5296.38 --> 5301.659000000001
move any money around you have to use a

5298.96 --> 5304.3
special device that the bank gave you to

5301.659 --> 5307.179
like read a code and then give the code

5304.3 --> 5308.860000000001
or you have a text transfer like PayPal

5307.179 --> 5312.639
does it now a lot of the times to your

5308.86 --> 5315.0
mobile that works fine

5312.639 --> 5319.179
as soon as you make it exclusive

5315.0 --> 5322.84
Biometrics it's going to immediately

5319.179 --> 5325.2390000000005
blow up as a criminal looting system

5322.84 --> 5327.28
like so many people are gonna suddenly

5325.239 --> 5329.379999999999
get robbed

5327.28 --> 5330.88
without even realizing it until they

5329.38 --> 5333.82
just noticed that their bank account is

5330.88 --> 5336.639
all all red

5333.82 --> 5339.159
it's ridiculous

5336.639 --> 5340.96
don't do that

5339.159 --> 5342.839999999999
never do that

5340.96 --> 5346.96
[Music]

5342.84 --> 5349.42
Biometrics are not useful for banking

5346.96 --> 5352.179
the only thing that they serve any kind

5349.42 --> 5354.6990000000005
of purpose for is for public

5352.179 --> 5357.82
surveillance

5354.699 --> 5360.879999999999
for potential criminal investigations

5357.82 --> 5363.28
like hey somebody's suspected of a crime

5360.88 --> 5366.46
where were they right

5363.28 --> 5370.3
that's like the only thing the only

5366.46 --> 5372.34
thing that I would say yeah okay maybe

5370.3 --> 5375.46
you could do that

5372.34 --> 5379.719
but when it comes to like standardized

5375.46 --> 5380.6
systems for banking or whatever no

5379.719 --> 5381.219
no

5380.6 --> 5382.26
[Music]

5381.219 --> 5385.78
no

5382.26 --> 5388.659000000001
don't do that

5385.78 --> 5391.0
I mean seriously just look at the sheer

5388.659 --> 5393.4
amount of movies alone

5391.0 --> 5396.46
where there's Biometrics I'm super

5393.4 --> 5399.04
secret lab of some kind whether it's bio

5396.46 --> 5400.9
or weapons or whatever in a movie you

5399.04 --> 5403.0
know how that goes it's like oh we have

5400.9 --> 5406.78
to have this special thumb scan or ice

5403.0 --> 5409.9
scan or guess what they do they in like

5406.78 --> 5414.04
every [ __ ] movie that has that every

5409.9 --> 5415.08
single one we've ever seen every single

5414.04 --> 5417.699
one

5415.08 --> 5420.34
immediately shows you how how they're

5417.699 --> 5423.48
gonna falsify it and then get in there I

5420.34 --> 5423.4800000000005
mean come on

5425.38 --> 5430.1990000000005
and you think that's a good idea to then

5427.3 --> 5430.1990000000005
Implement that

5433.5 --> 5440.26
right right price of Adam PGC net turret

5437.739 --> 5444.04
have you ever seen a movie

5440.26 --> 5446.639
where there's like Iris scan fingerprint

5444.04 --> 5449.199
scans right to get in the super secret

5446.639 --> 5452.139
high security thingy

5449.199 --> 5453.879999999999
have you ever seen a single movie in

5452.139 --> 5458.82
which that is presented

5453.88 --> 5458.82
in which they do not bypass it

5461.28 --> 5469.5
hmm yeah I'm right aren't I every single

5466.78 --> 5473.08
movie that has ever had those devices

5469.5 --> 5476.699
always have a part of the movie being

5473.08 --> 5480.76
them bypassing their devices

5476.699 --> 5484.239
every single time it's shown in a movie

5480.76 --> 5487.12
for like the last 40 years

5484.239 --> 5488.29
huh huh

5487.12 --> 5491.489
huh

5488.29 --> 5491.489
[Music]

5492.04 --> 5494.639
so

5495.54 --> 5500.98
let's not do that then yeah Minority

5498.1 --> 5503.1990000000005
Report exactly they'll go any length

5500.98 --> 5504.699
but by my Minority Report it's even more

5503.199 --> 5506.86
serious because it's like somebody's

5504.699 --> 5509.259999999999
life is on the line and all that

5506.86 --> 5512.86
and then getting an eye replacement yeah

5509.26 --> 5517.3
it's dramatic but the point is you can

5512.86 --> 5520.0599999999995
bypass it people will bypass it

5517.3 --> 5522.400000000001
and especially in the early stages of

5520.06 --> 5524.56
implementation it's immediately going to

5522.4 --> 5527.0199999999995
be a disaster rolling out with massive

5524.56 --> 5529.659000000001
amounts of Fraud and very little

5527.02 --> 5532.900000000001
capacity to actually even do anything

5529.659 --> 5535.42
about it at first it's gonna start out

5532.9 --> 5538.179
as a giant disaster

5535.42 --> 5539.92
with a lot of criminals looting a lot of

5538.179 --> 5542.219
innocent people

5539.92 --> 5542.219
foreign

5548.02 --> 5555.76
but but you know what I mean right guys

5550.62 --> 5558.94
every single movie every single movie I

5555.76 --> 5564.06
mean every Spy Movie every sort of

5558.94 --> 5564.0599999999995
sci-fi movie but every spy movie

5564.46 --> 5570.0
they every time there's some kind of

5566.8 --> 5573.900000000001
biometric issue super security they all

5570.0 --> 5576.96
ways get past it always

5573.9 --> 5580.0599999999995
I don't know a movie in which they don't

5576.96 --> 5583.3
do you I would like to hear about that

5580.06 --> 5586.54
movie in which they don't bypass the

5583.3 --> 5588.219
super secret bias biometric security I'd

5586.54 --> 5590.199
like to hear about that movie in which

5588.219 --> 5592.659
they don't succeed because I don't know

5590.199 --> 5594.5199999999995
any and I've seen like a hundred movies

5592.659 --> 5597.48
in which they do

5594.52 --> 5597.4800000000005
if not more

5598.62 --> 5604.36
right am I right can I get it you're

5601.659 --> 5605.389999999999
right in the chat

5604.36 --> 5610.0599999999995
laughs

5605.39 --> 5612.88
[Music]

5610.06 --> 5615.4800000000005
or I'd like to hear about that movie in

5612.88 --> 5615.4800000000005
which they don't

5623.38 --> 5628.42
so just think about that see this is the

5626.199 --> 5631.178999999999
type of [ __ ] that I do somebody brings

5628.42 --> 5633.159
up oh biometric security for banks what

5631.179 --> 5635.38
do you think steamy Trafford we usually

5633.159 --> 5636.94
asks good questions and immediately I

5635.38 --> 5639.52
draw in like hey

5636.94 --> 5642.159
have you ever seen a movie in which they

5639.52 --> 5644.139
don't actually succeed in bypassing

5642.159 --> 5646.9
biometric security

5644.139 --> 5649.42
have you ever seen one I bet you never

5646.9 --> 5651.099999999999
heard anybody ask you that question in

5649.42 --> 5653.32
response have you

5651.1 --> 5655.0
well here you do

5653.32 --> 5657.36
it's called The Flat Earth early bird

5655.0 --> 5657.36
show

5660.73 --> 5663.969999999999
[Music]

5667.54 --> 5671.76
anyway it's almost time to round out the

5669.58 --> 5671.76
show

5674.32 --> 5679.54
it was pretty interesting except for all

5676.84 --> 5682.3
the silent Parts which really annoyed me

5679.54 --> 5684.94
but then I just got really fired up and

5682.3 --> 5686.8
kept that up

5684.94 --> 5691.0599999999995
because sometimes you just have to get

5686.8 --> 5694.3
pissed off to wake everybody the [ __ ] up

5691.06 --> 5697.120000000001
it's a technique that I've seen applied

5694.3 --> 5701.38
by my teachers back in the day quite a

5697.12 --> 5704.739
plenty and everybody's just then teaches

5701.38 --> 5707.1990000000005
or like use the ruler to slam it flat on

5704.739 --> 5710.0199999999995
the table and then everybody's awake

5707.199 --> 5712.82
this is I just you need to do that

5710.02 --> 5716.26
sometimes apparently

5712.82 --> 5716.259999999999
[Music]

5720.219 --> 5724.6
so you are saying the movies have it

5722.26 --> 5726.46
right they are saying this Tech can and

5724.6 --> 5728.679
will be bypassed

5726.46 --> 5734.1
well yeah

5728.679 --> 5734.1
but not only that it encourages you

5735.4 --> 5742.48
because in the movies it's not the evil

5739.42 --> 5746.26
guys that do that no it's the good guys

5742.48 --> 5749.199
against the evil authoritarians right

5746.26 --> 5751.179
that have to bypass the biosecurity or

5749.199 --> 5752.739
it's a thief that break in the stinky

5751.179 --> 5755.82
rich people

5752.739 --> 5755.82
they always succeed

5758.139 --> 5766.02
and they will show you suggestions in

5761.679 --> 5766.02
many many ways on how to do it right

5766.06 --> 5771.400000000001
where it's like faking a print like even

5769.3 --> 5772.900000000001
Gattaca

5771.4 --> 5774.82
remember that

5772.9 --> 5777.879999999999
the guy is completely faking his

5774.82 --> 5781.42
identity having they take blood

5777.88 --> 5784.3
they literally take blood samples like

5781.42 --> 5786.52
three times a day

5784.3 --> 5790.900000000001
for identification purposes in that

5786.52 --> 5795.219
movie everybody yeah and even that level

5790.9 --> 5798.099999999999
of biometric security was completely

5795.219 --> 5799.719
bypassed it was the entire point of the

5798.1 --> 5802.900000000001
movie

5799.719 --> 5807.84
yeah I mean come on

5802.9 --> 5807.839999999999
they show you exactly how to do it

5813.219 --> 5817.2390000000005
did he even do it in Harry Potter that's

5815.26 --> 5820.659000000001
hilarious I didn't know I'm not a big

5817.239 --> 5822.638999999999
Harry Potter movie guy so or a book

5820.659 --> 5824.86
so I don't really know anything about it

5822.639 --> 5828.900000000001
other than roughly what they look like

5824.86 --> 5828.9
and that they say stupid words

5829.0 --> 5834.88
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

5832.179 --> 5838.32
thought it turned out pretty good

5834.88 --> 5838.32
potion same idea

5840.1 --> 5844.3
it's gonna be much of a movie if the

5841.96 --> 5848.1
security systems work

5844.3 --> 5848.1
yeah but the point is is that

5848.44 --> 5853.599999999999
look in the 80s

5850.659 --> 5856.299999999999
Only the Lonely in the 80s they would do

5853.6 --> 5858.1
like [ __ ] action movies right and

5856.3 --> 5859.96
then there was a security system this is

5858.1 --> 5861.04
for example what the Last Action Hero

5859.96 --> 5862.54
parody

5861.04 --> 5864.5199999999995
I don't know if they literally had an

5862.54 --> 5866.739
example like this but where it's like oh

5864.52 --> 5869.620000000001
you just need to Boom knock it on the

5866.739 --> 5872.199
right spot and oh it's open right total

5869.62 --> 5874.179
[ __ ] now that is movie Magic

5872.199 --> 5878.0199999999995
nonsense right

5874.179 --> 5881.1990000000005
but that's like silly 80s action movies

5878.02 --> 5884.02
and [ __ ] I mean since then it's like 40

5881.199 --> 5886.178999999999
years past and there's a lot of movies

5884.02 --> 5890.620000000001
in which well it's more like a spy game

5886.179 --> 5892.9
right a bit like uh Mission Impossible

5890.62 --> 5895.9
and they do it with great care they

5892.9 --> 5898.719
don't make it silly movie Magic nonsense

5895.9 --> 5900.28
for silly action no they Negative they

5898.719 --> 5902.679
show it and then they have to it's like

5900.28 --> 5906.0599999999995
a whole thing and they take it pretty

5902.679 --> 5906.06
serious on average

5906.88 --> 5910.900000000001
shoot the alarm says yeah but that's

5909.94 --> 5914.62
yeah

5910.9 --> 5917.04
in reality that doesn't work that rarely

5914.62 --> 5920.08
happens but the point is is that oh

5917.04 --> 5922.719
Biometrics it's such a good security yet

5920.08 --> 5927.219
in every movie that's brought up every

5922.719 --> 5930.639
single one without one single exception

5927.219 --> 5932.699
they show you exactly how it's bypassed

5930.639 --> 5935.86
no exception

5932.699 --> 5937.599999999999
right and yeah it wouldn't be much of a

5935.86 --> 5941.38
movie if there's security systems work

5937.6 --> 5943.96
but they show you how to bypass it how

5941.38 --> 5946.54
it's going to be bypassed they figure it

5943.96 --> 5949.0
out probably screenwriter or the

5946.54 --> 5952.92
scriptwriter is just getting some

5949.0 --> 5952.92
technical guy like how would you do that

5953.26 --> 5959.860000000001
movies are not really oh thank you for

5956.44 --> 5963.339999999999
