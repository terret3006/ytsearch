6.18 --> 40.379
[Music]

36.289 --> 45.57
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.379 --> 45.899
early-bird number three 465 I'm your

45.57 --> 47.609
host

45.899 --> 49.32

49.32 --> 53.129
you deem fit and if you haven't already

51.269 --> 54.75
subscribed to my channel and it's about

53.129 --> 56.37
notification so you know when I'm going

54.75 --> 59.67
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

56.37 --> 62.849999999999994
Amsterdam time every day didn't bit late

59.67 --> 64.739
sorry and please also do support me

62.85 --> 72.3
through patreon we go fund me in super

64.739 --> 75.149
chat much appreciated so yeah today the

72.3 --> 77.34
weather is actually quite beautiful all

75.149 --> 81.539
of a sudden there was a bit of some

77.34 --> 85.17
above now the big clouds really

81.539 --> 86.7
beautiful and yeah I noticed one little

85.17 --> 89.46000000000001
oddity today

86.7 --> 94.049
the celestial skies and is that the moon

89.46 --> 95.61
is visible somewhere over there I think

94.049 --> 101.28
it's behind a cloud now but it's like a

95.61 --> 103.86
very very fine moon cycle and yeah the

101.28 --> 107.969
Sun is pretty much over there

103.86 --> 111.0
so like the the setting angular wise is

107.969 --> 114.509
like this they're extremely close it's

111.0 --> 118.109
so odd and the moon cycle is kind of

114.509 --> 120.07900000000001
facing the Sun but it should be like

118.109 --> 122.759
this and it's kind of being like this

120.079 --> 125.479
it's so weird I don't know if you could

122.759 --> 127.659
properly see that what I just did

125.479 --> 130.36
improvising

127.659 --> 132.61
but yeah unfortunately now that the

130.36 --> 134.65
collec big cloud is smoothing over zone

132.61 --> 137.91000000000003
maybe I'll try to show you a little bit

134.65 --> 140.44
later but it really stood out to me that

137.91 --> 145.03
the moon angular wise just seems

140.44 --> 153.489
extremely close to the Sun and that's so

145.03 --> 156.16
odd that's like how how can it be it

153.489 --> 160.5
should almost be shining from behind the

156.16 --> 160.5
moon if we were in a heliocentric system

164.19 --> 172.85999999999999
right so anyway yeah I have tea with me

167.799 --> 172.86
but I gotta get it be right back

235.22 --> 251.55
right sorry seems to be a little bit

241.5 --> 253.86
disorganized today anyway because yeah

251.55 --> 256.17
my tank was kind of out of water when I

253.86 --> 260.78000000000003
got up so I had to refill it takes a

256.17 --> 268.41
while so I just could now got tea

260.78 --> 271.5
so let's use in chat a GM was first

268.41 --> 280.8
Amanda young wait sixty RM siege or

271.5 --> 288.45
Sanford good servant they lie Ohio

280.8 --> 296.52000000000004
Dorian Gray iron bear dank it's an

288.45 --> 298.95
Oakland ninety eighty Sade a mocha mark

296.52 --> 301.77
colored

298.95 --> 304.83
yeah good to see you all Oh Chad stuck

301.77 --> 317.15999999999997
thanks that was quick

304.83 --> 320.64
ooh super jet donation right bits sixty

317.16 --> 323.58000000000004
RMC ten Californian well Californian

320.64 --> 326.49
Californian dollars who knows in the

323.58 --> 327.96
future right it's Canadian dollars

326.49 --> 329.64
anyway thank you for the ten that

327.96 --> 333.89
Canadian dollars keep spreading the

329.64 --> 336.21
truth made people are starting to listen

333.89 --> 342.78
yeah maybe they are

336.21 --> 343.82
I wonder it almost makes me a little

342.78 --> 348.33
nervous

343.82 --> 350.01
to be fair like I it's weird I can't

348.33 --> 353.65999999999997
really pinpoint it but I had a really

350.01 --> 357.68
rough night again it yesterday too but

353.66 --> 362.16
this night too and I can't even place it

357.68 --> 365.40000000000003
it's I know in the night I just it's

362.16 --> 368.16
rough sleep I get a lot of I don't know

365.4 --> 372.71999999999997
not to get grosser and they get bowel

368.16 --> 374.88000000000005
problems it's just like weird cramps out

372.72 --> 377.25
of nowhere that that really stick I

374.88 --> 380.25
don't know it's too much information but

377.25 --> 382.32
it's odd because I normally don't have

380.25 --> 386.55
that so it feels like something is going

382.32 --> 390.08
on I guess my body is kind of going

386.55 --> 393.75
through its transformation somehow

390.08 --> 397.31
probably responding it feels like I

393.75 --> 400.41
should be getting a cold too like that

397.31 --> 404.42
it's weird I is it tough to it I don't

400.41 --> 404.42
know if I will literally get a cold but

404.9 --> 410.64
I'm just kind of sick of all the

407.28 --> 417.33
pressure so maybe my body is deciding

410.64 --> 419.84999999999997
yeah maybe you should go and go with it

417.33 --> 421.8
up to some degree so we can clean up

419.85 --> 424.47
some of this mess I don't know that's my

421.8 --> 427.2
personal interpretation I don't exactly

424.47 --> 432.62
know maybe it is just dress keeping me

427.2 --> 434.68
out and I also noticed that I'm just

432.62 --> 434.68
you

438.5 --> 446.81
fortune Theatre of darkness

441.03 --> 446.80999999999995
and then gets a bad effect on me it like

446.87 --> 454.52
makes me have trouble distinguishing

449.16 --> 456.14000000000004
between myself and under individuals

454.52 --> 460.83
yeah

456.14 --> 464.18
it's not healthy so yeah I think I've

460.83 --> 467.34
been I'm being a little bit overloaded

464.18 --> 469.32
and I'm gonna try to just be very

467.34 --> 471.35999999999996
careful I'm also gonna I've been trying

469.32 --> 473.63
to call my healer again like wow what is

471.36 --> 477.75
this situation what should I do

473.63 --> 479.96999999999997
probably take it calm right but yeah

477.75 --> 482.25
it's just everything going on in the

479.97 --> 485.79
world the things that I seemingly have

482.25 --> 491.79
tumbled or stumbled upon that I've

485.79 --> 494.88
started seeing it just unnerves me and

491.79 --> 498.23
it's so elaborate so complex everybody's

494.88 --> 498.23
digging in their own way but

503.86 --> 508.48
yeah especially concerning the

505.75 --> 511.69
coronavirus situation what the media

508.48 --> 513.9
what governments are doing with it I'm

511.69 --> 519.31
just wondering if there is some kind of

513.9 --> 522.15
plan for it all like what what is the

519.31 --> 526.3299999999999
direction this is going to unfold into

522.15 --> 528.91
inevitably that's basically what I've

526.33 --> 531.1600000000001
been thinking about not too hard it's

528.91 --> 535.3
just that I can't help it it's just what

531.16 --> 537.8199999999999
I do it's like my gamemaster instincts I

535.3 --> 540.13
just have to see like yeah what would be

537.82 --> 542.44
the typical potentia logical conclusions

540.13 --> 545.92
to that how can it be used how was it

542.44 --> 548.8000000000001
originally used what is it being used

545.92 --> 558.2199999999999
for by those that are not on the

548.8 --> 561.8499999999999
forefront it's oh yeah goats yeah I was

558.22 --> 565.45
home 24/7 again yesterday it was it was

561.85 --> 567.46
a decent conversation there didn't hang

565.45 --> 571.48
around too long though came back a

567.46 --> 574.5600000000001
little bit later but still yeah the

571.48 --> 578.29
conversation was so all over that lazy

574.56 --> 581.26
but it's interesting over there

578.29 --> 581.8
I wouldn't Benjamin of course watched it

581.26 --> 584.41
again

581.8 --> 586.24
crushed it even let the chatter open for

584.41 --> 588.8399999999999
a bit until trolls just started [ __ ]

586.24 --> 588.84
all over it

597.59 --> 600.2800000000001
all right

608.63 --> 615.62
yeah good servant that the thing is I

612.31 --> 618.829
gave like several options as to what I

615.62 --> 621.17
thought it could be and I'm literally

618.829 --> 626.5089999999999
not even sure if there is like a real

621.17 --> 630.709
genuine virus like the flu type thing in

626.509 --> 632.99
some way or if it is indeed like a thing

630.709 --> 635.3599999999999
that is like astrologically approaching

632.99 --> 639.319
a moment where suddenly everybody will

635.36 --> 642.019
get disease kind of like what I think

639.319 --> 644.449
happened in the 80s and which I was part

642.019 --> 649.22
of too back then was in the middle of it

644.449 --> 651.139
okay I don't know exactly because it

649.22 --> 654.769
could technically turn out to be a

651.139 --> 658.2090000000001
complete hoax with like tricking and

654.769 --> 661.279
crisis but it's just so ammonia

658.209 --> 663.079
over arcing that way it creeps me out if

661.279 --> 665.329
that were to be the case if it is all

663.079 --> 674.8599999999999
complete Act it would probably creep me

665.329 --> 674.8599999999999
out even more so I don't know I yeah

676.36 --> 681.32
but it may just turn out to be like that

679.4 --> 685.0
that there's literally nothing out on

681.32 --> 691.9100000000001
its so it almost freaks me out anyway oh

685.0 --> 696.08
yeah sorry Nathan your sticker aii the

691.91 --> 697.5799999999999
two-pound to the two-pound pair from

696.08 --> 709.94
these and oakley ninety eighty thank you

697.58 --> 713.2
for the superjet it is devious but who

709.94 --> 716.2
and what is using it to what end you

713.2 --> 716.2
know

723.44 --> 730.87
[Music]

727.92 --> 732.8499999999999
anyway let's let's not talk about that I

730.87 --> 736.509
don't want to talk about that constantly

732.85 --> 739.9
it's just let's talk about flat earth or

736.509 --> 746.85
something or anything else

739.9 --> 746.85
[Music]

753.259 --> 761.87
Hanako Ella yeah I heard the 5g link but

758.459 --> 764.819
I don't know that could be true

761.87 --> 769.05
it could be true that they yeah they

764.819 --> 773.37
somehow figured out well through

769.05 --> 780.5889999999999
resonance which it can definitely do to

773.37 --> 780.589
basically spawn the virus effect locally

780.8 --> 787.889
it's like to trigger the sake influence

785.309 --> 790.769
and but I don't think that that could

787.889 --> 794.189
literally spawn the mutated version out

790.769 --> 795.809
of nothing you see I don't think that

794.189 --> 798.689
that is even possible because the

795.809 --> 802.769
mutated version could only really be

798.689 --> 805.259
spreading by contact and as it would be

802.769 --> 810.449
spreading it would also start to mutate

805.259 --> 811.439
further usually as by law of mutation so

810.449 --> 815.2199999999999
how I see it

811.439 --> 818.0999999999999
it would digress and become less harmful

815.22 --> 824.929
become more of the natural version when

818.1 --> 829.7090000000001
that happens relatively quickly so yeah

824.929 --> 833.189
but it besides the supposed 5g inducing

829.709 --> 836.91
effect which is purely theoretical very

833.189 --> 840.929
very theoretical at this point for me it

836.91 --> 844.309
could generally be that just having cell

840.929 --> 846.87
phones especially bigger ones 5g ones

844.309 --> 849.179
calling with them having them next to

846.87 --> 850.949
your head having them on your body as

849.179 --> 854.67
they are still on doing things or

850.949 --> 858.269
downloading god forbid right that the

854.67 --> 862.079
general phone influence thus burden your

858.269 --> 865.74
body and may help it towards deciding to

862.079 --> 871.649
trigger becoming sick so that maybe

865.74 --> 873.689
there as a separate effect it's kind of

871.649 --> 876.839
just the consequences of what is around

873.689 --> 878.41
not even a devious little technology

876.839 --> 884.5600000000001
trick

878.41 --> 884.56
so yeah so many aspects to all of this

884.72 --> 888.229
[Music]

893.529 --> 896.529
this

900.209 --> 903.42
all right

913.829 --> 918.529
behold the flat globe yeah who knows

937.279 --> 942.62
getting only more cloudy from the looks

940.38 --> 942.62
of it

951.23 --> 959.72
yeah anybody away if anybody wants to

955.79 --> 962.05
come on with me maybe Nathan does that's

959.72 --> 962.0500000000001
fine

986.66 --> 989.66
yeah

1019.43 --> 1028.49
oh yeah I saw a little uh Karen b2

1023.3 --> 1030.58
yesterday late though Karen B and Mark

1028.49 --> 1045.95
sergeant that was pretty interesting

1030.58 --> 1051.23
about prepping yeah hello hello hey

1045.95 --> 1054.32
nothin yeah I'm okay I'm a I don't know

1051.23 --> 1056.17
it feels like I'm almost getting sick or

1054.32 --> 1060.5
something I'm a little tense but I'm

1056.17 --> 1062.9
psychologically doing okay yeah it is

1060.5 --> 1065.51
beautiful it's a bit cloudy right now

1062.9 --> 1069.41
but yeah I could even see the Moon and

1065.51 --> 1072.83
Sun in in the same yet in the same view

1069.41 --> 1075.0800000000002
in one point that's pretty interesting

1072.83 --> 1076.49
did you see that anything like that like

1075.08 --> 1078.77
I've seen that many times it's not

1076.49 --> 1081.47
that's not an uncommon occurrence it's

1078.77 --> 1083.69
kind of new be felt new be flattered

1081.47 --> 1085.43
thing that people discuss from time to

1083.69 --> 1088.67
time like it's Nikolas heliocentric

1085.43 --> 1092.69
model can't cope with right because the

1088.67 --> 1094.8200000000002
moon cycle is it's just so close angular

1092.69 --> 1098.45
wise and the moon cycle is just sitting

1094.82 --> 1101.27
there it's like okay so why isn't the

1098.45 --> 1103.94
sun shining from behind it if it is so

1101.27 --> 1104.54
much closer by you know it makes no

1103.94 --> 1108.53
sense

1104.54 --> 1112.04
I just remit I'm asking Chris monk about

1108.53 --> 1114.17
it because he had from heliocentric

1112.04 --> 1116.12
model and I was like can you show me

1114.17 --> 1117.41
this moon that moon is this an

1116.12 --> 1120.4699999999998
impossible moon is that an impossible

1117.41 --> 1122.6000000000001
and they never were like never I think

1120.47 --> 1125.48
he might have had a vaguely remember him

1122.6 --> 1126.77
showing we warned impossible moon it was

1125.48 --> 1128.48
a very very specific set of

1126.77 --> 1130.1
circumstances I can't remember it it

1128.48 --> 1131.63
didn't make a very big impression on me

1130.1 --> 1133.73
but generally speaking in that regard

1131.63 --> 1136.25
that's what the most it's based on right

1133.73 --> 1138.82
what about the celestial bodies so

1136.25 --> 1141.65
they're gonna get that bit right I guess

1138.82 --> 1144.3799999999999
it could kind of work out it just seems

1141.65 --> 1147.0800000000002
a natural you know it doesn't really

1144.38 --> 1148.91
seem like actual balls and lights

1147.08 --> 1151.22
shining from behind and all that it's

1148.91 --> 1152.5700000000002
just what joking a shiny that was the

1151.22 --> 1153.049
one thing Chris monk did show me that

1152.57 --> 1156.1689999999999
was point

1153.049 --> 1159.71
rusting so if you imagine your school

1156.169 --> 1161.8690000000001
yard or school model version of the

1159.71 --> 1167.1490000000001
heliocentric model hmm even if it's just

1161.869 --> 1169.07
like a balls on bit of fishing wire

1167.149 --> 1171.649
you know you imagine just picture it in

1169.07 --> 1173.029
your mind the heliocentric model and

1171.649 --> 1175.879
what it does and things spinning around

1173.029 --> 1177.83
discern and all that right when Chris

1175.879 --> 1179.57
showed it me said the most interesting

1177.83 --> 1182.21
thing I could show you is this and he

1179.57 --> 1186.559
flicked a switch metaphorically and

1182.21 --> 1189.47
turned on the Sun I'll let you think

1186.559 --> 1191.649
about what I've said for a second so

1189.47 --> 1194.3890000000001
typically when you see the model

1191.649 --> 1196.58
nothing's lit right you just see the

1194.389 --> 1198.4399999999998
light do you see the light looking ball

1196.58 --> 1200.299
it's like you just see the balls right

1198.44 --> 1202.1000000000001
right the balls moving around you don't

1200.299 --> 1206.179
see the sunshine you're right in your

1202.1 --> 1207.859
eyes I mean there might be some examples

1206.179 --> 1210.6490000000001
out there but I've not seen them the Sun

1207.859 --> 1213.9499999999998
isn't the light source in of the models

1210.649 --> 1215.809
the models just lit in its entirety so

1213.95 --> 1217.249
when you turn the Sun on that's when you

1215.809 --> 1219.859
get some interesting problems in terms

1217.249 --> 1222.169
of what should have presence on it what

1219.859 --> 1224.359
should be lit what should be dark you

1222.169 --> 1226.48
know the rest of the celestial bodies

1224.359 --> 1229.639
but that was neat well [ __ ] they're not

1226.48 --> 1232.309
for example look if the moon supposedly

1229.639 --> 1235.789
causes moon eclipses on the earth you

1232.309 --> 1237.95
know then should that effect not be out

1235.789 --> 1242.09
there with the other planets and their

1237.95 --> 1243.32
moons constantly well I'm just saying

1242.09 --> 1245.269
that the light is that when they're all

1243.32 --> 1247.07
lit doesn't seem to make as much sense

1245.269 --> 1248.84
as when you just show it as a model

1247.07 --> 1250.879
accounting for the balls moving in a

1248.84 --> 1252.859
particular way right and you like them

1250.879 --> 1254.539
it certainly doesn't seem to hook quite

1252.859 --> 1255.559
as well was all a saying that was that's

1254.539 --> 1258.289
the only thing I can think of I mean

1255.559 --> 1260.33
that's the cell anemia nor ever had you

1258.289 --> 1262.73
say that words with the bell on it cell

1260.33 --> 1264.739
anine yeah yeah I can never say either

1262.73 --> 1266.659
but people in the audience will know

1264.739 --> 1270.409
we're talking about when you've got an

1266.659 --> 1273.7990000000002
impossible moonrise you know with an

1270.409 --> 1276.769
eclipse and the Sun and the moon both

1273.799 --> 1278.84
above the horizon in other words you

1276.769 --> 1281.09
haven't got their arrangement where the

1278.84 --> 1282.74
thing causing the Eclipse is one body

1281.09 --> 1285.98
physically blocking the other body

1282.74 --> 1286.85
because you can see them both right yeah

1285.98 --> 1290.96
that's where

1286.85 --> 1293.2099999999998
yeah I mean I've I've only seen two like

1290.96 --> 1294.74
I different different captures from

1293.21 --> 1296.539
different people I think there's very

1294.74 --> 1299.21
many out there on video they just get

1296.539 --> 1306.919
older but this I've seen it I'm not with

1299.21 --> 1309.8600000000001
my own eyes obviously right yeah weird

1306.919 --> 1312.529
but anyway my concept I guess still

1309.86 --> 1315.35
stands it's like okay if we have this

1312.529 --> 1317.299
moon supposedly eclipsing the Sun from

1315.35 --> 1320.48
our Earth's surface you know and there's

1317.299 --> 1323.629
this shadow just going around it well

1320.48 --> 1326.48
shouldn't that since that does kind of

1323.629 --> 1328.85
happen on a relatively regular base you

1326.48 --> 1331.19
know around the years shouldn't that

1328.85 --> 1333.4699999999998
kind of thing then happen just as

1331.19 --> 1335.6000000000001
regularly with all these supposed to

1333.47 --> 1338.059
giant planets out there and their moons

1335.6 --> 1341.4189999999999
should we not be seeing these eclipses

1338.059 --> 1343.46
shadows but passing over the surface of

1341.419 --> 1347.769
their moons in that kind of thing from

1343.46 --> 1347.769
the earth even yeah exactly

1349.69 --> 1356.929
yeah but we don't I don't I've never

1354.32 --> 1359.0
seen it even being mentioned as a thing

1356.929 --> 1361.46
I'd like oh look we're zooming in on

1359.0 --> 1364.34
Jupiter now look it's moon see the

1361.46 --> 1366.019
shadow there on the clouds it's so yeah

1364.34 --> 1368.059
it's interesting because the shadow is

1366.019 --> 1371.379
actually bigger than the moon see just

1368.059 --> 1371.379
like on earth it makes so much sense

1375.58 --> 1380.629
works conceptualizing yourself on a ball

1379.1 --> 1382.85
to understand how the lights in the sky

1380.629 --> 1385.4289999999999
move with a few problems that they

1382.85 --> 1387.529
openly declare it's just that see it's

1385.429 --> 1389.179
just a philosophical way of looking at

1387.529 --> 1391.759
the world so you can wrap your head

1389.179 --> 1393.71
around the lights in the sky doesn't

1391.759 --> 1396.679
mean the earth sphere philosophically

1393.71 --> 1403.3600000000001
you can think of it as a sphere yeah but

1396.679 --> 1407.6490000000001
it doesn't mean it is indeed all right

1403.36 --> 1410.4499999999998
interesting huh any year other

1407.649 --> 1412.539
developments going on in this weekend

1410.45 --> 1415.999
that I haven't been aware of

1412.539 --> 1420.169
yeah I'm SB 69 corner of the Black Swan

1415.999 --> 1422.509
this time with the more distant 9.41

1420.169 --> 1425.3300000000002
over enough power many miles it was oil

1422.509 --> 1429.32
platform all squashed all right yeah

1425.33 --> 1432.559
yeah with the relief still above the

1429.32 --> 1434.389
other one though yeah in terms of its

1432.559 --> 1435.59
positioning and where the horizon is is

1434.389 --> 1437.289
no different vivillon that you've got

1435.59 --> 1440.2099999999998
some compression on the second platform

1437.289 --> 1442.7
yeah so what the horizon argument is

1440.21 --> 1445.279
exactly the same they still just as good

1442.7 --> 1447.799
a Black Swan if anything the horizon

1445.279 --> 1452.179
slightly higher yeah a little slightly

1447.799 --> 1455.679
better yeah it's almost like the horizon

1452.179 --> 1458.8400000000001
is just being a little bit more

1455.679 --> 1462.049
compacted than usual as it were so like

1458.84 --> 1463.82
it it folds into the horizon and the

1462.049 --> 1468.23
folding is a little bit more aggressive

1463.82 --> 1470.389
so it's got squished and probably a

1468.23 --> 1474.1390000000001
little squished upwards to from the

1470.389 --> 1476.4499999999998
bottom that that's how I see it like it

1474.139 --> 1487.1899999999998
the dish in the distance it just folds

1476.45 --> 1489.0800000000002
into the horizon right yeah the actual

1487.19 --> 1493.5800000000002
visual yeah and that's supposedly

1489.08 --> 1495.049
stooping indeed is this do you think it

1493.58 --> 1496.49
could be I think it doesn't really

1495.049 --> 1499.6689999999999
matter I think so

1496.49 --> 1502.759
it's like they're compacting I think

1499.669 --> 1504.6190000000001
that was stooping now thinking about I

1502.759 --> 1506.1490000000001
think looming is the opposite of

1504.619 --> 1507.32
stooping which means things being raised

1506.149 --> 1508.4289999999999
up so snooping is probably things

1507.32 --> 1511.299
dropping down as opposed to being

1508.429 --> 1514.549
squashed stretched and squashed mirages

1511.299 --> 1517.549
owls duping so looming and stooping are

1514.549 --> 1519.259
literally a cookie cutter displacement

1517.549 --> 1521.749
and the other ones are about the

1519.259 --> 1524.09
compression or stretching yeah exactly

1521.749 --> 1525.95
okay and then you've got mirages which

1524.09 --> 1527.1789999999999
obviously is a separate category because

1525.95 --> 1529.309
you've got things that are inverted and

1527.179 --> 1530.6100000000001
copies of things all right

1529.309 --> 1533.7
right

1530.61 --> 1536.1899999999998
yeah it's still complicated for me to

1533.7 --> 1545.28
get all the effects separate sometimes

1536.19 --> 1547.71
it still mix them up sorry so you could

1545.28 --> 1549.559
you could hold them to task on where

1547.71 --> 1551.79
they're where they're claiming

1549.559 --> 1554.46
atmospheric refraction and where it

1551.79 --> 1557.73
doesn't sit as applicable in their

1554.46 --> 1561.0900000000001
definitions so this is gonna be a bit

1557.73 --> 1563.76
convoluted in their definitions all of

1561.09 --> 1566.9399999999998
them refer to a geometric horizon so the

1563.76 --> 1569.25
rhetoric is solid their horizon the easy

1566.94 --> 1571.799
geometric it's just a fact so all of the

1569.25 --> 1573.78
definitions fall in line with describing

1571.799 --> 1576.12
a geometric horizon because that's what

1573.78 --> 1577.5
it is in their model now the fact

1576.12 --> 1579.09
they're asserting it about reality is

1577.5 --> 1581.96
neither here nor there the definition of

1579.09 --> 1585.03
the globe heads horizon is fact

1581.96 --> 1589.98
geometric so when they start describing

1585.03 --> 1592.44
atmospheric effects you can always catch

1589.98 --> 1595.799
them out if you will because you can't

1592.44 --> 1598.77
apply their definitions of atmospheric

1595.799 --> 1602.6689999999999
refraction when the basis of the

1598.77 --> 1605.91
definition is in reference to a

1602.669 --> 1608.0400000000002
geometric horizon so the looming for

1605.91 --> 1611.16
instance will take place with respect to

1608.04 --> 1613.23
the horizon in their definitions because

1611.16 --> 1615.179
you could use it if it didn't write that

1613.23 --> 1616.169
contradiction would violate the law of

1615.179 --> 1618.89
motion

1616.169 --> 1622.679
that in in relation to the geometric

1618.89 --> 1623.97
horizon specifically exactly as long as

1622.679 --> 1625.77
you starting from the standpoint that

1623.97 --> 1629.549
the horizon is geometric which it is by

1625.77 --> 1633.299
definition so on their hello on their

1629.549 --> 1636.66
Guillou standard standard definitions

1633.299 --> 1638.25
the general rhetoric there for you

1636.66 --> 1640.919
general wiki and three new general

1638.25 --> 1642.48
dictionary entry is a heliocentric entry

1640.919 --> 1644.7
now that's not to say that they're

1642.48 --> 1646.02
specifically gonna be referencing the

1644.7 --> 1647.64
heliocentric model if you take a

1646.02 --> 1649.74
National Geographic reference resistance

1647.64 --> 1652.0490000000002
and look for their definition and cite

1649.74 --> 1653.82
it it won't necessarily have anything to

1652.049 --> 1656.61
do with the heliocentric model or a

1653.82 --> 1658.4399999999998
globe earth but the one I'll be

1656.61 --> 1661.4399999999998
describing in the horizon will be

1658.44 --> 1663.0
geometric by definition and therefore it

1661.44 --> 1664.23
will be non sequitur if you're trying to

1663.0 --> 1666.9
describe something

1664.23 --> 1669.66
moving rhythms led to its south that's a

1666.9 --> 1672.75
non-sequitur so they'll always have the

1669.66 --> 1676.02
same definition a trench level they've

1672.75 --> 1679.11
started to deny physical geometry now

1676.02 --> 1681.15
for Huey he said well motor get time to

1679.11 --> 1682.6499999999999
the you know cold into a camp to tell

1681.15 --> 1684.39
you what type of reflection don't just

1682.65 --> 1686.6100000000001
let them go bring up a fraction tellin

1684.39 --> 1688.5300000000002
what asking what type and getting to

1686.61 --> 1691.049
define it and then point out the error

1688.53 --> 1692.549
in their in their definition when

1691.049 --> 1694.049
they're trying to loom the horizon with

1692.549 --> 1697.2
respect to the horizon and show why it's

1694.049 --> 1699.21
not sector but I wouldn't do that I've

1697.2 --> 1700.3500000000001
explained it all so I'm not just saying

1699.21 --> 1701.97
I don't understand the definite I'm not

1700.35 --> 1703.5
going to utilize it I do understand it -

1701.97 --> 1705.69
learn the definitions and I understand

1703.5 --> 1707.25
the reason why he wants people to do

1705.69 --> 1709.89
this he wants them to understand that

1707.25 --> 1713.34
just marking off refraction isn't

1709.89 --> 1715.71
actually applicable but I try and

1713.34 --> 1716.6689999999999
sidestep that so I'll actually give it

1715.71 --> 1718.74
them okay

1716.669 --> 1721.89
refraction you say so the horizon is

1718.74 --> 1725.669
refracted and they go yeah you go well

1721.89 --> 1728.0700000000002
it's not a metric then that ends the

1725.669 --> 1728.73
argument I'm all for going immediately

1728.07 --> 1730.1399999999999
for the kill

1728.73 --> 1731.94
as soon as they Peck the question

1730.14 --> 1733.2900000000002
pointed out and that's the end of the

1731.94 --> 1735.63
argument that the views fallacious

1733.29 --> 1738.21
reason in this instance the moment they

1735.63 --> 1739.98
relinquish the geometric horizon because

1738.21 --> 1741.66
they're saying is refracted I couldn't

1739.98 --> 1744.059
if the definition matches it or not

1741.66 --> 1746.0400000000002
you're saying is refracted okay I'll

1744.059 --> 1749.01
accept that at face value you can

1746.04 --> 1750.6299999999999
refract the horizon but pointing out

1749.01 --> 1752.8799999999999
that their horizon can't be refracted

1750.63 --> 1754.3200000000002
because it's geometric what's the point

1752.88 --> 1762.1200000000001
just lay another yeah okay it's

1754.32 --> 1765.27
refracted hold on technically their

1762.12 --> 1767.76
geometric horizon assuming that it is

1765.27 --> 1770.52
what it is could be refracted and all

1767.76 --> 1774.09
that no but hold on hold on but it would

1770.52 --> 1778.1299999999999
always it would not warp around the way

1774.09 --> 1778.1299999999999
does because optics don't work that way

1778.64 --> 1784.98
yeah I'm talking about walls do you know

1781.86 --> 1789.62
geometry yeah you gotta play yeah you

1784.98 --> 1789.6200000000001
got a point I'm trying to get to reality

1790.37 --> 1795.7199999999998
argument the people just aren't getting

1792.62 --> 1796.8999999999999
they don't seem to recognize that while

1795.72 --> 1798.94
it's possible let's take

1796.9 --> 1800.2
mr. sensible example I take the

1798.94 --> 1803.64
magnifying glass to put you in front of

1800.2 --> 1805.57
the camera moves the horizon yeah okay

1803.64 --> 1807.4
at that point you're not gonna be

1805.57 --> 1809.49
drawing a straight tangent line to a

1807.4 --> 1812.5300000000002
physical point on that all it's

1809.49 --> 1814.41
refracted not representative of the

1812.53 --> 1817.6299999999999
reality moved in relationship

1814.41 --> 1821.0800000000002
non-geometric that's why I got rumpus

1817.63 --> 1823.0600000000002
talking in circles because his model if

1821.08 --> 1825.76
it's refract it is not geometric I've

1823.06 --> 1828.6299999999999
done two videos same title almost if the

1825.76 --> 1831.49
horizon is refracted it's not geometric

1828.63 --> 1833.17
their models got a geometric horizon and

1831.49 --> 1834.64
they're a fraction if they takes a

1833.17 --> 1836.8600000000001
terrestrial fraction which they must

1834.64 --> 1839.7700000000002
have some sage depend the light around

1836.86 --> 1842.9199999999998
the geometry they don't have anymore

1839.77 --> 1844.84
they've gone R and the R value leads up

1842.92 --> 1848.5
to the outside edge of the sphere that's

1844.84 --> 1851.29
the hope V singular the horizon in the

1848.5 --> 1853.57
globe model it's a geometric horizon end

1851.29 --> 1855.9099999999999
of statement so when they come and say

1853.57 --> 1857.71
it's refracted why spend any time

1855.91 --> 1859.24
arguing about the fact that their

1857.71 --> 1860.89
definitions don't comply with their

1859.24 --> 1866.02
claim of refraction when you can just

1860.89 --> 1868.89
say okay not geometric then yeah I know

1866.02 --> 1868.8899999999999
I get it

1874.38 --> 1879.22
explain how to have to move the horizon

1877.0 --> 1880.75
and you know it's wonderful you couldn't

1879.22 --> 1882.22
if you were complying with your

1880.75 --> 1884.95
definition of horizon because it's

1882.22 --> 1886.48
geometric in every example but I don't

1884.95 --> 1889.0900000000001
care about that you think you can

1886.48 --> 1891.01
refract it maybe you can but you can't

1889.09 --> 1892.57
if it's geometric and it's placing your

1891.01 --> 1894.7
model on the R values that you're gonna

1892.57 --> 1897.7
refract things with and the horizon

1894.7 --> 1900.5800000000002
itself with the same value that's fixed

1897.7 --> 1902.8
set changed and if you don't have it you

1900.58 --> 1904.6599999999999
don't have it at the end of geometry

1902.8 --> 1907.0
they're saying is not geometric you

1904.66 --> 1913.3600000000001
might as well say no we don't have to

1907.0 --> 1916.69
use my geometry yeah as soon as as soon

1913.36 --> 1918.6699999999998
as they deny it they literally yeah

1916.69 --> 1921.22
shoot in their foot they literally take

1918.67 --> 1922.96
the foundation that they need there in

1921.22 --> 1926.47
order to continue their reasoning and

1922.96 --> 1928.24
they don't even realize it precisely the

1926.47 --> 1931.929
moment you say no

1928.24 --> 1936.52
horizon can be looms then you're saying

1931.929 --> 1939.5800000000002
no we don't have to use geometry for the

1936.52 --> 1941.35
horizon right now you're right we don't

1939.58 --> 1945.24
yeah that's right no we don't do that

1941.35 --> 1947.77
that's right a few of the we do may do

1945.24 --> 1950.29
I'm insisting on having physical

1947.77 --> 1951.55
geometry any like why is Nathan

1950.29 --> 1953.05
insisting on this having physical

1951.55 --> 1956.11
geometry it's like don't you get it

1953.05 --> 1960.97
that's your fame you insist we have

1956.11 --> 1967.0
geometry I love it when they do geometry

1960.97 --> 1972.73
that's just your religion you're having

1967.0 --> 1976.15
physical geometry I just know what

1972.73 --> 1978.82
you're yeah yeah Nathan you're always

1976.15 --> 1982.179
first you always used to strawman them

1978.82 --> 1984.37
with that supposedly the wind moving

1982.179 --> 1986.14
over the earth Coriolis effect well

1984.37 --> 1987.9399999999998
everywhere all ballers know that they

1986.14 --> 2013.0800000000002
don't have a Coriolis effect because it

1987.94 --> 2017.28
moves right they're using globe geometry

2013.08 --> 2020.28
but they seem to be very easily by it

2017.28 --> 2022.92
yes scrubbing the natural consequences

2020.28 --> 2025.08
of geometry and forces and things to the

2022.92 --> 2038.19
side when it turns out not to be the

2025.08 --> 2040.05
case in reality basically what about the

2038.19 --> 2041.8200000000002
optics about the fallacies about the

2040.05 --> 2045.45
geometries about the actual nature of it

2041.82 --> 2047.309
all right so just trust it on yeah and

2045.45 --> 2049.95
we can all all we can do is ridiculous

2047.309 --> 2052.679
now they trust radius Dominus gravity

2049.95 --> 2054.27
smoother Sanctus all that crap

2052.679 --> 2056.129
mr. Italy all the fact that they could

2054.27 --> 2057.78
actually just you know right up until

2056.129 --> 2061.94
they're saying themselves well it's not

2057.78 --> 2061.94
geometric like you've all belief

2062.139 --> 2070.2200000000003
yep welcome to fly I believe you are 17

2069.47 --> 2072.31
all right

2070.22 --> 2074.419
it was great having you on Thanks

2072.31 --> 2089.72
hopefully that'll keep you conversation

2074.419 --> 2091.6389999999997
Oh pray after our premiere right yeah it

2089.72 --> 2096.1389999999997
was it was the fright the second Friday

2091.639 --> 2098.03
show right yeah just for our live to a

2096.139 --> 2100.099
limited audience but the most part most

2098.03 --> 2103.34
people haven't seen it and for the most

2100.099 --> 2104.75
part nobody see because despite it just

2103.34 --> 2106.9100000000003
being a premiere I thought that the

2104.75 --> 2108.859
Friday show all of them were pretty damn

2106.91 --> 2111.14
good so definitely I'm looking for

2108.859 --> 2114.04
that's what I do if I'm really honest I

2111.14 --> 2117.74
did have slightly selfish motivations

2114.04 --> 2129.08
it's okay Nathan it's okay you can enjoy

2117.74 --> 2130.7599999999998
your own work if you want to alright so

2129.08 --> 2131.18
that was gonna start in 20 minutes from

2130.76 --> 2137.599
now

2131.18 --> 2138.64
exactly alright thanks thanks for being

2137.599 --> 2146.7200000000003
on a panel today

2138.64 --> 2150.04
see you around yeah good stuff yeah I

2146.72 --> 2153.7999999999997
thought the Friday show was kind of good

2150.04 --> 2155.839
it yeah I don't know it's like the

2153.8 --> 2157.849
intensity of these of the debates

2155.839 --> 2160.5499999999997
quality it just goes up and down with

2157.849 --> 2164.3300000000004
energy waves and I don't know this seems

2160.55 --> 2166.1600000000003
like I guess a viable strategy to aim

2164.33 --> 2169.19
the peaks at Friday because they're

2166.16 --> 2172.04
spread out over the weekend and it seems

2169.19 --> 2177.14
to me yeah I've noticed that just a lot

2172.04 --> 2180.08
of intense Friday episodes and I try to

2177.14 --> 2181.91
do my best for it as well so yeah I

2180.08 --> 2184.24
definitely watched the premiere after

2181.91 --> 2184.24
the show

2186.13 --> 2196.369
mm-hmm oh they lie Ohio what theory

2193.99 --> 2202.0099999999998
Nathan is definitely comfortable with

2196.369 --> 2208.7000000000003
the things that he knows I didn't hear

2202.01 --> 2213.3100000000004
him talk a lot of theory really except

2208.7 --> 2213.31
for a while globe theory

2223.46 --> 2230.7490000000003
yeah but I was good just putting down

2226.92 --> 2234.96
the the points of the month as it were

2230.749 --> 2238.9399999999996
the Black Swan the consequences looking

2234.96 --> 2242.46
a little bit deeper onto the details of

2238.94 --> 2247.16
what is reason out what has been put

2242.46 --> 2250.289
there even years ago and just showing

2247.16 --> 2253.0789999999997
everything revealing what it is much

2250.289 --> 2255.0890000000004
more tied into natural consequences of

2253.079 --> 2258.539
things and of the systems that the

2255.089 --> 2262.67
people that use them actually need to

2258.539 --> 2266.67
apply according to their own beliefs and

2262.67 --> 2269.19
and all that and the natural

2266.67 --> 2271.349
consequences of models if you assume

2269.19 --> 2273.599
them to be real and that's something

2271.349 --> 2275.809
that growers in general like the kind of

2273.599 --> 2279.739
overlook unless they have found

2275.809 --> 2282.4500000000003
something that they could make play into

2279.739 --> 2284.43
the suspension of this belief that the

2282.45 --> 2287.759
earth could indeed be a globe and then

2284.43 --> 2291.93
they'll love to forward it in in a

2287.759 --> 2295.109
relatively complicated fashion so that

2291.93 --> 2296.91
yeah you could see those things as some

2295.109 --> 2298.98
kind of belief of the earth being a ball

2296.91 --> 2302.009
and spinning just like the Foucault

2298.98 --> 2305.94
pendulum is like that like what does it

2302.009 --> 2307.67
really do nothing but it when they make

2305.94 --> 2310.739
you look at it they tell you how to

2307.67 --> 2314.9300000000003
imagine the earth spinning underneath it

2310.739 --> 2317.849
and then yeah in your mind it can click

2314.93 --> 2322.14
doesn't make it real though it's more

2317.849 --> 2327.029
about an imagining practice than it is

2322.14 --> 2328.8289999999997
really about that swinging pendulum like

2327.029 --> 2330.989
if the swinging pendulum were supposedly

2328.829 --> 2333.0890000000004
there and there was no person to

2330.989 --> 2334.559
instruct how to imagine it people would

2333.089 --> 2339.119
just look at it like okay that's

2334.559 --> 2341.9700000000003
supposed to prove something yeah because

2339.119 --> 2344.5190000000002
it doesn't you have to imagine the earth

2341.97 --> 2348.6299999999997
being a ball spinning underneath it and

2344.519 --> 2351.41
then you get the trinket that they

2348.63 --> 2356.299
supposedly discovered in this mechanism

2351.41 --> 2356.299
to assist the imagining of the globe

2358.94 --> 2362.089
all right

2367.06 --> 2372.62
hmm

2369.49 --> 2372.62
[Music]

2384.369 --> 2387.089
all right

2389.67 --> 2395.46
yeah modus tollens is ruler logic or a

2392.9 --> 2398.549
logical consequence you could say a

2395.46 --> 2404.279
consequence of logic ruler logic call

2398.549 --> 2407.579
natural consequence but it is like more

2404.279 --> 2411.98
a structure of the it's about the

2407.579 --> 2411.98
structure of the reasoning itself

2417.69 --> 2424.92
and it's safe to say that modus tollens

2420.51 --> 2430.6800000000003
as a concept cannot really be how do you

2424.92 --> 2433.86
say disproven because of the mechanism

2430.68 --> 2435.5099999999998
that it that it is it is just what it is

2433.86 --> 2441.4500000000003
you can't really disprove it or it

2435.51 --> 2448.11
wouldn't be that a situation is a motor

2441.45 --> 2455.2799999999997
stolen or it is not I hope I got this

2448.11 --> 2457.56
right all these academics sometimes

2455.28 --> 2463.4700000000003
sticks a little and I have a little bit

2457.56 --> 2466.52
difficult making it stick right the

2463.47 --> 2466.52
logical consistency

2494.59 --> 2506.02
right yeah we got at least 15 minutes

2498.1 --> 2508.72
more on the clock so I was sighing kind

2506.02 --> 2510.7
of sorry to have Nathan go because it

2508.72 --> 2523.0499999999997
was yeah it's always good for good

2510.7 --> 2526.33
conversation it's like the things that I

2523.05 --> 2530.4700000000003
deal with in my mind like on my own time

2526.33 --> 2532.5699999999997
I really like things that I should be

2530.47 --> 2536.0499999999997
wiser and just say like that's not your

2532.57 --> 2537.7000000000003
thing to worry about maybe you should

2536.05 --> 2543.55
just leave that to the people that

2537.7 --> 2548.68
actually have the responsibility well

2543.55 --> 2551.8300000000004
yeah I think I've always had an issue

2548.68 --> 2557.56
like that I draw things towards myself

2551.83 --> 2559.36
and kind of yeah should literally focus

2557.56 --> 2564.96
a little bit more on my own life and

2559.36 --> 2568.36
don't don't get my spirit so entangled

2564.96 --> 2571.0
with outside things that in a more

2568.36 --> 2574.1800000000003
direct sense don't concern my physical

2571.0 --> 2577.6
well-being and not let my spirit burden

2574.18 --> 2581.89
my physical well-being with the sorrows

2577.6 --> 2587.62
and the worries because yeah I'm just

2581.89 --> 2592.48
the guy on YouTube I'm literally a guy

2587.62 --> 2596.47
that lives off welfare yeah it is true I

2592.48 --> 2599.41
do do newspaper bringing newspaper

2596.47 --> 2601.5699999999997
around and I really do it because of how

2599.41 --> 2604.3199999999997
much people appreciate it and because

2601.57 --> 2608.86
literally every single week I do that

2604.32 --> 2611.38
there's always always always at least

2608.86 --> 2614.8
one person telling me we're so happy

2611.38 --> 2616.09
that you do this cuz yeah my my

2614.8 --> 2618.67
neighbourhood they don't spread it

2616.09 --> 2620.53
around anymore so happy about it can I

2618.67 --> 2622.63
please have five more so I can give it

2620.53 --> 2624.76
to my neighbors because I do have a lot

2622.63 --> 2627.51
of left so that is really the real

2624.76 --> 2627.51
reason I do it

2627.78 --> 2637.9
but yeah this just me I'm just this guy

2631.9 --> 2641.29
I have a relatively basic life I yeah I

2637.9 --> 2646.349
guess on average one could suggest that

2641.29 --> 2649.0299999999997
I have limited but still drug problems

2646.349 --> 2652.15
because I do spend money on it at least

2649.03 --> 2655.3
and well I keep my health sort of in

2652.15 --> 2657.46
check but yeah so it putting that all

2655.3 --> 2661.9900000000002
together is it really my place to be

2657.46 --> 2666.63
like oh I gotta I gotta figure this

2661.99 --> 2670.6899999999996
thing out for everyone in the world

2666.63 --> 2676.349
because sometimes I could but I should

2670.69 --> 2679.48
not burden my feelings with it so much I

2676.349 --> 2682.44
don't know it's just a piece of inner

2679.48 --> 2682.44
reflection I guess

2687.16 --> 2695.019
yeah and and I got a I still got my own

2690.64 --> 2698.549
life to do I gotta move on to in my own

2695.019 --> 2701.6499999999996
way and I move slowly it's my thing

2698.549 --> 2709.269
but I got a move I can't be stuck

2701.65 --> 2714.359
forever it's drug enjoyment no but to be

2709.269 --> 2717.7889999999998
fair a man like me it is a drug problem

2714.359 --> 2722.799
but yeah there's drug problems and

2717.789 --> 2728.1090000000004
there's drug problems okay drug problems

2722.799 --> 2730.509
is when yeah you're not getting ahead as

2728.109 --> 2732.569
much as you want to or you don't feel as

2730.509 --> 2735.819
strong as you want to because you do

2732.569 --> 2737.89
really like your beers in the weekend

2735.819 --> 2739.109
and you'd like pull yourself full that's

2737.89 --> 2742.3289999999997
a drug problem

2739.109 --> 2744.549
when you overdo it or some other drugs

2742.329 --> 2746.349
you know in that pool [ __ ] that's kind

2744.549 --> 2748.779
of a drug problem and then you have a

2746.349 --> 2752.079
drug problem and that is when people

2748.779 --> 2756.309
like get maniacal and stuff and they

2752.079 --> 2758.8900000000003
they get addicted to the maniacal

2756.309 --> 2760.779
mindset and then they start to abuse

2758.89 --> 2763.109
things they start to neglect think now

2760.779 --> 2766.18
that's a real drug problem when they

2763.109 --> 2768.759
basically turn hostile towards the world

2766.18 --> 2772.4199999999996
in favor of just one thing the

2768.759 --> 2776.469
experience itself that's a real drug

2772.42 --> 2780.4
problem unfortunately fortunately that

2776.469 --> 2782.619
doesn't happen to everyone because not

2780.4 --> 2784.089
everything concerning drugs always has

2782.619 --> 2787.839
to turn out into some kind of

2784.089 --> 2790.769
detrimental situation but discipline is

2787.839 --> 2790.769
just really important

2799.42 --> 2805.89
drugged what any drug any kind of drug

2802.45 --> 2808.5989999999997
and it well for me

2805.89 --> 2814.3289999999997
yeah I'd point in cannabis I find an

2808.599 --> 2819.46
alcohol like pointed tobacco coffee yeah

2814.329 --> 2824.65
that and in a way even tea but yeah it

2824.65 --> 2837.609
stimulant in there Bates exerc

2834.339 --> 2840.24
while this room is my private room it's

2866.619 --> 2874.75
I'll just keep my camera stuck to this

2869.2 --> 2877.029
very room forever I don't know why I

2874.75 --> 2879.67
can't really move the webcam so I'd have

2877.029 --> 2883.98
to then switch to some kind of phone

2879.67 --> 2883.98
streaming in order to achieve that oh

2887.069 --> 2895.99

2942.089 --> 2945.47
Wow today is messy

2969.99 --> 2979.39

2976.81 --> 2985.72
dropped right it's like how did that

2979.39 --> 2989.43
even happen that's a very interesting

2985.72 --> 2989.43
last five minutes of the show

2993.13 --> 2996.98
[Music]

2994.44 --> 2996.98
it

2999.76 --> 3007.2900000000004
yeah I dropped my tea like a full cup of

3004.29 --> 3010.23
tea just went clink right on top of my

3007.29 --> 3014.0099999999998
aura yeah off of my keyboard I managed

3010.23 --> 3016.28
to turn it over before you'd all sank in

3014.01 --> 3016.28
there

3019.73 --> 3026.9900000000002
anyway I think that bad

3036.03 --> 3043.0400000000004
god I hope it's not screwed I just got

3038.94 --> 3043.04
my keyboard to work properly again

3056.55 --> 3061.27
[Music]

3057.69 --> 3068.52
alright ok it doesn't look too bad let's

3061.27 --> 3068.52
see yeah ok let's test it out

3068.67 --> 3078.75
alright well the keys still seem to be

3071.349 --> 3093.4900000000002
functioning yeah I think it's alright

3078.75 --> 3099.16
yeah ok sorry for the mess yeah ok make

3093.49 --> 3101.97
sure this one doesn't tip over hmm let's

3099.16 --> 3101.97
get back in check

3128.08 --> 3131.08
okay

3140.73 --> 3149.29
crack fence for headaches bizarre Oh in

3145.18 --> 3152.71
a way you know I it sounds super crazy

3149.29 --> 3155.41
but the issue is once a person really

3152.71 --> 3156.79
gets addicted heavily to those type of

3155.41 --> 3159.7599999999998
heavy heavy drugs

3156.79 --> 3163.359
it really takes them and it's almost

3159.76 --> 3166.9
like statistically there's almost no way

3163.359 --> 3169.7799999999997
they can really come out of it so this

3166.9 --> 3174.339
is the policy concept if you just kind

3169.78 --> 3179.7400000000002
of give them what they need then they

3174.339 --> 3183.43
don't go out and do crimes and it works

3179.74 --> 3184.589
it's a very liberal concept and it

3183.43 --> 3189.609
really works

3184.589 --> 3192.3089999999997
but the problem is yeah if you then

3189.609 --> 3195.2799999999997
start to encourage everyone to just take

3192.309 --> 3197.26
drugs and take away the realization of

3195.28 --> 3199.9900000000002
the consequences yeah you get more

3197.26 --> 3202.1800000000003
burden so it is a damage control measure

3199.99 --> 3205.359
and it should absolutely not be made

3202.18 --> 3207.339
into some deliberate end result like oh

3205.359 --> 3212.41
yeah let's make everybody into freakin

3207.339 --> 3216.4
zombie junkies no no it's a damage

3212.41 --> 3218.29
control measure it's just to prevent the

3216.4 --> 3222.03
really out-of-control junkies from

3218.29 --> 3225.369
committing crimes that's what it's for

3222.03 --> 3227.4700000000003
it's not a start sign for everyone to

3225.369 --> 3237.04
just give up and start becoming a crazy

3227.47 --> 3246.1499999999996
junkie okay let that be clear yeah and

3237.04 --> 3246.15
meth too and all of it right

3257.85 --> 3263.92
so yeah if you see something like that

3260.47 --> 3267.0099999999998
and you see ya junkies or whatever and

3263.92 --> 3269.62
they're being handed drugs they're given

3267.01 --> 3272.23
a space to do that yeah it seems

3269.62 --> 3278.0499999999997
repulsive but it is a damage control

3272.23 --> 3280.18
measure you gotta realize that that's

3278.05 --> 3282.73
how it's meant that's how the people

3280.18 --> 3284.23
that are there doing it I think that's

3282.73 --> 3289.15
pretty much their mindset they're not

3284.23 --> 3293.53
there to to make more junkies absolutely

3289.15 --> 3296.32
not just keep that in mind anyway I'm

3293.53 --> 3298.0600000000004
gonna round out the show so thanks

3296.32 --> 3301.57
everyone for coming it's been a little

3298.06 --> 3306.0
bit of a messy show literally the tea

3301.57 --> 3306.0
dropping over and starting a little late

3308.76 --> 3315.67

3313.36 --> 3318.3700000000003

3315.67 --> 3321.67
