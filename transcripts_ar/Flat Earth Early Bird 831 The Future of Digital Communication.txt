to put down

168.879 --> 174.959
in the way i did and including the

172.16 --> 174.959
interactions

175.36 --> 181.519
minimizing the swearing leaving it to

178.48 --> 185.11999999999998
the specific moments where it

181.519 --> 189.519
where it can be appropriate

185.12 --> 193.599
complicated but yeah very proud of it

189.519 --> 193.59900000000002

he's basically become a professional

348.4 --> 356.96
personal trainer

352.72 --> 359.6
yeah on because of the knowledge that he

356.96 --> 361.19899999999996

very well researched and

361.199 --> 365.6

377.84 --> 380.88

effie makes you healthier

402.639 --> 407.12
well it does certainly hand you a lot of

405.52 --> 408.88
knowledge that you can use to make

407.12 --> 411.199
yourself healthy

408.88 --> 413.599
if you can get through the trolls and

411.199 --> 415.68
the friction and the psychological

413.599 --> 416.71999999999997
warfare because that part is not so

415.68 --> 418.24
healthy

416.72 --> 420.72
you really need to overcome those

418.24 --> 424.08
obstacles first before you can really

420.72 --> 424.08000000000004
reap the benefits of it

427.44 --> 430.71999999999997
amanda young yes i got my hair down i i

429.919 --> 433.039
just watched

430.72 --> 433.91900000000004
washed it this morning because i don't

433.039 --> 436.639
know i had some

433.919 --> 439.19899999999996
physical my body had a lot of physical

436.639 --> 443.84000000000003
stuff to work out

439.199 --> 445.52000000000004
i've had kind of pain in my jaw but it's

443.84 --> 447.35999999999996
german medicine based there's nothing

445.52 --> 451.19899999999996
real going on it was just like

447.36 --> 453.12
wow and i had went to sleep without

451.199 --> 454.88
but it's kind of better and it was very

453.12 --> 455.36
like sweaty so i just went under the

454.88 --> 458.08
shower

455.36 --> 459.36
and also called my healer to basically

458.08 --> 461.199
get confirmed yeah

459.36 --> 463.44
it's really not that serious it's

461.199 --> 465.599
psychosomatic basically it

463.44 --> 467.12
psychosomatic backlash german new

465.599 --> 467.759
medicine based because of a lot of

467.12 --> 470.639
stress

467.759 --> 470.96000000000004
in recent times kind of getting resolved

470.639 --> 472.879
and

470.96 --> 474.23999999999995
when it gets resolved when the nerve

472.879 --> 477.59900000000005
kind of stopped

474.24 --> 480.24
are resolved then typical physical

477.599 --> 481.84
responses roll out of that it's like the

480.24 --> 483.84000000000003
second part of it

481.84 --> 485.35999999999996
and that's kind of what's been going on

483.84 --> 485.919
and i'm pretty sure i'm going to get

485.36 --> 488.879
over it

485.919 --> 489.84
pretty quickly and my healer kind of

488.879 --> 491.759
confirmed that

489.84 --> 493.67999999999995
so very happy about it and i took a

491.759 --> 497.36
shower after he did

493.68 --> 499.919
his thing over the phone so i feel a lot

497.36 --> 499.91900000000004
better now

505.039 --> 508.0
yeah how are you saying

510.08 --> 513.68
they have new evidence on the molten

512.32 --> 517.7600000000001
iron core

513.68 --> 523.279
actually scientists found another layer

517.76 --> 523.279
of to the gob stopper earth what

524.64 --> 530.3199999999999
okay i i'm

527.76 --> 531.4399999999999
not familiar with the term gobstopper

530.32 --> 534.72
but

531.44 --> 538.1600000000001
maybe that's like a new york thing

534.72 --> 541.0400000000001
i don't know anyway yeah thanks

538.16 --> 541.04
thanks amanda young

542.72 --> 548.32
right it's still a bit wet it's still in

544.88 --> 552.64
the middle of drying up pretty much

548.32 --> 562.1600000000001
it's a candy okay

552.64 --> 566.16
doesn't sound very healthy

562.16 --> 568.48
i'm straight but hello now okay

566.16 --> 569.36
well chris la jumbe if you have to say

568.48 --> 576.08
that then

569.36 --> 579.04
maybe no it's okay

576.08 --> 580.1600000000001
but yes i've i know that typically

579.04 --> 583.4399999999999
having hair down

580.16 --> 585.36
does make me look a little bit more

583.44 --> 588.5600000000001
attractive on average i know

585.36 --> 590.9590000000001
it's just that i can't always do it

588.56 --> 593.1199999999999
because i'm not gonna keep washing my

590.959 --> 594.3199999999999
hair like on a daily basis it's not

593.12 --> 599.04
healthy for my skin

594.32 --> 603.36
and my hair but i can do it periodically

599.04 --> 605.8389999999999
and then when it's kind of

603.36 --> 607.12
getting a little fatty and that does

605.839 --> 609.12
happen right

607.12 --> 611.279
and if i wash it more it'll happen

609.12 --> 612.48
quicker so that's why i don't do it too

611.279 --> 614.88
often

612.48 --> 619.839
and then just put it in a knot as i

614.88 --> 619.8389999999999
usually do

621.44 --> 625.36
ah hey secret asian man glad you are

623.839 --> 627.839

625.36 --> 629.279

background imagery

704.56 --> 709.1199999999999
didn't have marinade

707.12 --> 710.8
i had to eat my french fries with

709.12 --> 713.68
ketchup ketchup

710.8 --> 713.68
not so good

715.6 --> 719.44
it's organic ketchup but still it's not

717.6 --> 722.0790000000001
the same as mayonnaise

719.44 --> 725.9200000000001
i don't know why i brought this up but

722.079 --> 731.8389999999999
i'm just very happy that i'll be able to

725.92 --> 731.8389999999999
get the proper groceries after the show

734.639 --> 738.32
because i really had just like five

737.36 --> 741.76

749.36 --> 763.519
very much

759.12 --> 766.8
oh no yeah jawbreakers yeah i know those

763.519 --> 770.48
yeah we had those those super hot

766.8 --> 770.4799999999999
things i used to like them as a kid

771.279 --> 776.48
but they're not too healthy though

774.32 --> 778.5600000000001
there was this whole issue about kids

776.48 --> 778.88
taking them too much and then getting

778.56 --> 782.7199999999999
like

778.88 --> 784.639
tongue cancer and freaky [ __ ] like that

782.72 --> 786.72
or i don't know if that's actually real

784.639 --> 788.0790000000001
that's what the information that i got

786.72 --> 790.399
back then as a kid

788.079 --> 792.2399999999999
never researched it was no internet for

790.399 --> 793.92
me to research whether that's actually

792.24 --> 796.88
real or not

793.92 --> 797.519
but it did kind of discourage me to yeah

796.88 --> 802.88
get

797.519 --> 802.88
addicted to it because i did like that

807.839 --> 811.7600000000001
in america ketchup is put on fries not

810.48 --> 815.36
mayonnaise

811.76 --> 817.519
all right to each their own you know i

815.36 --> 819.04
just like mayonnaise mayonnaise organic

817.519 --> 821.44
variety

819.04 --> 828.88
of a certain type is just really good

821.44 --> 832.32
for me my body really appreciates it

828.88 --> 835.519
and i don't know but i think

832.32 --> 838.0790000000001
that ketchup way it's produced

835.519 --> 839.279
what it can do if you take a lot of it

838.079 --> 844.56
on a regular basis

839.279 --> 844.56
it kind of like enhances

845.199 --> 852.639
not allergic responses but like

848.8 --> 856.7199999999999
is it histamine like agitation

852.639 --> 858.88
sensations it tends to aggravate it

856.72 --> 862.0790000000001
at least it does for me so every time i

858.88 --> 865.6
eat a lot of ketchup i do notice like

862.079 --> 868.4799999999999
like i feel more itchy

865.6 --> 871.12
or like some minor inflammation may

868.48 --> 873.36
actually hurt

871.12 --> 874.399
it's weird i don't know why exactly why

873.36 --> 877.92
that is

874.399 --> 882.639
but ketchup for me not not too great

877.92 --> 886.079
oh man young paypal really

it's been kind of kind of tight

951.36 --> 955.12
in the last few weeks and now everything

953.839 --> 958.8000000000001

1058.96 --> 1067.8400000000001
bonus coffee

1068.16 --> 1072.0
oh yeah by the way guys did have you

1070.32 --> 1074.8799999999999
noticed that yesterday's show

1072.0 --> 1076.4
i don't know if anybody checked it but

1074.88 --> 1081.8400000000001
like it got

1076.4 --> 1081.8400000000001
a lot of views and even a lot of upvotes

1083.52 --> 1088.0
and so i did this the show before that

1085.44 --> 1090.88
but that might also be because

1088.0 --> 1091.76
yeah the show in between like yeah

1090.88 --> 1095.8400000000001
didn't

1091.76 --> 1095.84
go through

1097.52 --> 1100.8799999999999
right so whatever i'm doing right i'm

1099.28 --> 1102.0
gonna try to keep it up as much as

1100.88 --> 1104.0800000000002
possible

1102.0 --> 1106.32
also i'm gonna make a habit of having

1104.08 --> 1108.1599999999999
lunch before i start the show

1106.32 --> 1110.799
because i did that yesterday and that

1108.16 --> 1114.48
worked out great

1110.799 --> 1119.28
no silent pauses so maybe it's just me

1114.48 --> 1119.28
kind of like postponing hunger what

1120.0 --> 1125.52
what julia pabin what is this

1126.88 --> 1129.3600000000001
okay

1132.88 --> 1137.8400000000001
what dude

1138.32 --> 1141.12
holy [ __ ]

1143.52 --> 1152.24
that's a lot

1150.08 --> 1154.24
it's like i started to get the feeling

1152.24 --> 1154.88
it's my birthday or something today

1154.24 --> 1158.24
because

1154.88 --> 1161.1200000000001
what uh thank you that's

1158.24 --> 1161.6
that's a lot thank you very much man

1161.12 --> 1165.84
holy

1161.6 --> 1165.84
damn uh

1166.64 --> 1169.1200000000001
okay

1169.679 --> 1174.48
i think i might actually be able to

1172.72 --> 1177.1200000000001
push some of that that out of the way

1174.48 --> 1179.84
now that's really amazing

1177.12 --> 1179.84
thank you so much

1183.36 --> 1188.3999999999999
this is it flustered here

1190.48 --> 1198.16
holy [ __ ] damn that's yeah

1194.72 --> 1201.28
uh let's try to focus on the show

1198.16 --> 1204.4
hey ciao young cat

1201.28 --> 1207.36
cumulonimbus came alone

1204.4 --> 1210.5590000000002
camilo nimbus that's that's hilarious i

1207.36 --> 1210.559
haven't heard that one before

1218.84 --> 1221.84
man

1224.88 --> 1229.679
so you don't get het

1232.84 --> 1239.76
angry hungry

1235.2 --> 1242.88
angry is hungry angry is angry is that

1239.76 --> 1248.96
hungry and angry at the same time or

1242.88 --> 1250.88
angry because you're hungry

1248.96 --> 1252.559
anyway well that's definitely not going

1250.88 --> 1255.2800000000002
to happen in the coming week i know that

1252.559 --> 1255.28
for sure now

1256.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
yeah thanks man thank you so much

1266.64 --> 1274.24
oh look at that sun's coming out

1270.72 --> 1279.2
even just oh and it's got again

1274.24 --> 1279.2
i'm still better there and it's gone

1285.44 --> 1289.679
did you know mayonnaise is rather easy

1287.76 --> 1292.0
to make

1289.679 --> 1292.0
yes

1294.48 --> 1299.76
but it's kind of difficult to make it

1296.72 --> 1299.76
just right though

1300.159 --> 1304.3200000000002
but i think that if yeah if i had a

1302.559 --> 1306.48
better living circumstance

1304.32 --> 1308.96
where i had like bigger kitchen room to

1306.48 --> 1311.2
myself and i had could

1308.96 --> 1312.48
then i could potentially try and make my

1311.2 --> 1315.919
own mayonnaise because i

1312.48 --> 1317.76
had the room for it but it's a good

1315.919 --> 1319.2800000000002
point yes mayonnaise is not that

1317.76 --> 1321.039
difficult to make if you get the right

1319.28 --> 1326.24
ingredients

1321.039 --> 1326.24
and you find the perfect balance then

1328.24 --> 1335.52
it's not that difficult to make it would

1331.679 --> 1335.52
it would probably save some money too

1342.64 --> 1351.2800000000002
yeah kiwi does absolutely get angry

1346.48 --> 1351.28
absolutely that's funny

1352.96 --> 1361.8400000000001
grumpus grumpus

1356.4 --> 1361.8400000000001
gets hangry

1365.44 --> 1371.919
what is the topic uh well so far

1369.12 --> 1372.559
there hasn't been really a topic just

1371.919 --> 1374.72
kind of

1372.559 --> 1375.9189999999999
talked about yesterday's show i was

1374.72 --> 1378.72
really happy with it

1375.919 --> 1381.919
and it got quite a few views also a lot

1378.72 --> 1381.919
of comments all of a sudden

1383.919 --> 1389.8400000000001
and uh right i'm pretty much open for a

1387.039 --> 1402.24
topic

1389.84 --> 1404.72
anything special gone down

1402.24 --> 1407.84
uh so just joey should come way explain

1404.72 --> 1411.84
different scientific principles

1407.84 --> 1415.52
uh yeah

1411.84 --> 1419.1999999999998
well i kind of already do that just

1415.52 --> 1422.8799999999999
every now and then when people display

1419.2 --> 1422.88
obvious misunderstanding of them

1424.559 --> 1430.24
but it like for me to really calmly

1427.279 --> 1433.6
explain it in a good way

1430.24 --> 1434.4
without like getting like pissed off in

1433.6 --> 1436.1589999999999
between

1434.4 --> 1438.48
i do have to be kind of in a special

1436.159 --> 1440.96
mood for that

1438.48 --> 1442.72
right now like i watch back yesterday's

1440.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
show and it's like yeah i pretty much

1442.72 --> 1445.84
put down

1447.2 --> 1451.8400000000001
all things that are like currently

1449.039 --> 1451.84
really relevant

1453.44 --> 1457.039
i'm bidding on a job what you have to

1455.679 --> 1461.6000000000001
bid on it

1457.039 --> 1461.6
alright good luck neil

1462.559 --> 1468.1589999999999
i did it well yesterday clutch bear yeah

1464.559 --> 1468.1589999999999
i agree i'm very proud of it

1470.32 --> 1475.12
i guess you can say you're having a good

1472.64 --> 1475.1200000000001
hair day

1476.48 --> 1485.44
right i i well i showered

1481.919 --> 1487.039
roughly an hour ago a little more so

1485.44 --> 1489.279
you know when i get out of the shower

1487.039 --> 1492.4
and my hair is going to be pretty good

1489.279 --> 1492.4
a little fluffy maybe

1496.64 --> 1504.0800000000002
i have to take a tile in a dialysis

1500.96 --> 1515.8400000000001
what is taking up tile i don't know what

1504.08 --> 1515.84
that means

1523.52 --> 1530.24
oh you found a job in a soft meal no

1526.72 --> 1530.72
face mask or needles all right makes

1530.24 --> 1532.64
sense

1530.72 --> 1534.559
although dude if you're going to be at a

1532.64 --> 1536.0
sawmill i kind of would recommend that

1534.559 --> 1538.08
you would

1536.0 --> 1539.84
it would probably better to have it like

1538.08 --> 1542.08
a dust dust mask

1539.84 --> 1543.4399999999998
right because if it's going to be sawing

1542.08 --> 1545.1999999999998
sawdust

1543.44 --> 1547.2
it's not too great to constantly breathe

1545.2 --> 1550.4
that in so you might actually

1547.2 --> 1554.0
want to wear a mask for that but yeah no

1550.4 --> 1554.0
vaccine that makes no sense

1554.08 --> 1558.0
it depends on how close you are to the

1556.24 --> 1560.88
actual sauce

1558.0 --> 1561.6
of course if you're just helping with

1560.88 --> 1564.64
the log

1561.6 --> 1570.7199999999998
transport and all that

1564.64 --> 1572.64
then it wouldn't be necessary i think

1570.72 --> 1574.72
but yeah you don't want to breathe in

1572.64 --> 1577.3600000000001
that sawdust on a daily basis

1574.72 --> 1585.84
that's not too great you're that's going

1577.36 --> 1585.84
to give you trouble eventually

1588.88 --> 1596.5590000000002
wow can you hear the wind

1592.32 --> 1596.559
i see the sound bar going back and forth

1596.64 --> 1601.8400000000001
every time augusta win comes

1605.84 --> 1613.84
right not mandatory okay well that's

1607.679 --> 1613.8400000000001
fine then then it's up to the people

1619.6 --> 1627.84
right now the supermarket warehouse yep

1634.88 --> 1638.0
in a way though you know with the

1636.48 --> 1640.24
warehouses

1638.0 --> 1641.44
i think i think there could be better

1640.24 --> 1644.88
ways to deal with it

1641.44 --> 1647.6000000000001
from a oh a virus is out there

1644.88 --> 1649.44
perspective because i think that putting

1647.6 --> 1651.76
people in warehouses making them wear

1649.44 --> 1653.039
masks is very detrimental even to the

1651.76 --> 1654.72
quality of the work they're going to be

1653.039 --> 1657.12
performing over time

1654.72 --> 1659.2
i think it would be much better there

1657.12 --> 1661.52
was a system

1659.2 --> 1662.3990000000001
where they basically could put packages

1661.52 --> 1666.399
through quick

1662.399 --> 1668.0
uv light instead of forcing everybody to

1666.399 --> 1669.4399999999998
wear a freaking mask on the off

1668.0 --> 1671.12
chance that they might have something

1669.44 --> 1672.0800000000002
infectious that could rub off on the

1671.12 --> 1675.4399999999998
product

1672.08 --> 1677.6
just let it go pass through like you

1675.44 --> 1677.6000000000001
know

1679.6 --> 1684.08
rolling automator how do you call that

1685.52 --> 1689.84
you know what i mean right just go

1687.76 --> 1691.44
through a thing that's just gonna

1689.84 --> 1693.1999999999998
some uv light and it's gonna be

1691.44 --> 1695.679
disinfected that should

1693.2 --> 1697.76
work fine as well and then you don't

1695.679 --> 1699.3600000000001
have to freaking force everybody to wear

1697.76 --> 1701.2
a mask which is going to

1699.36 --> 1704.1589999999999
bring down the quality and probably

1701.2 --> 1705.919
cause increasing amounts of accidents

1704.159 --> 1707.3600000000001
because of concentration loss and all

1705.919 --> 1709.5200000000002
that because that's what

1707.36 --> 1712.399
marrying masks on a regular basis does

1709.52 --> 1714.0
especially have to do it all day

1712.399 --> 1716.4799999999998
conveyor belt that's the one thank you

1714.0 --> 1716.48
clutch bear

1723.679 --> 1728.3200000000002
so if there was just a like an end line

1726.88 --> 1730.96
conveyor belt

1728.32 --> 1732.24
into the delivery truck or whatever

1730.96 --> 1734.799
system

1732.24 --> 1736.08
just basic uv light you know not some

1734.799 --> 1738.24
heavy scanners yet

1736.08 --> 1741.279
just basic uv light let the package the

1738.24 --> 1741.279
box go through it

1741.84 --> 1745.36
and it should be fine i know it's i'm

1744.32 --> 1747.2
just thinking

1745.36 --> 1749.039
thinking out like technological

1747.2 --> 1751.679
solutions

1749.039 --> 1752.96
you know i think a lot of workers would

1751.679 --> 1755.679
be very happy

1752.96 --> 1757.52
with that as an alternative than if they

1755.679 --> 1760.0800000000002
would have to wear freaking masks all

1757.52 --> 1760.08
workday

1760.24 --> 1766.96
so yeah industrialists package

1763.76 --> 1770.08
centers all that think about it

1766.96 --> 1773.44
you know you don't want to just

1770.08 --> 1776.0
burden your workers until

1773.44 --> 1777.279
things go wrong because then everything

1776.0 --> 1781.84
goes wrong

1777.279 --> 1781.84
and they don't want that

1783.52 --> 1787.6
right if they're going to assume there's

1786.08 --> 1789.6
a virus

1787.6 --> 1790.7199999999998
then solve it like that don't force your

1789.6 --> 1795.84
workers to

1790.72 --> 1795.84
to suffocate

1796.0 --> 1799.039
that's my advice

1801.52 --> 1807.6
and yeah with with supermarkets

1804.799 --> 1809.84
cash cash registers this a little

1807.6 --> 1809.84
different

1810.64 --> 1814.3990000000001
because there's just constant human

1812.48 --> 1816.559
interaction as well

1814.399 --> 1817.84
but in warehouses that should not have

1816.559 --> 1823.84
to be like that

1817.84 --> 1823.84
right does am i making sense

1828.159 --> 1831.919
shouldn't be hard my pool has a uv light

1831.039 --> 1835.6
filter

1831.919 --> 1838.96
huh cool right

1835.6 --> 1841.4399999999998
because it can be very basic

1838.96 --> 1842.24
and the technology for this kind of

1841.44 --> 1844.48
thing

1842.24 --> 1845.76
also over the decades has become a lot

1844.48 --> 1847.6
cheaper i think

1845.76 --> 1851.84
it's not that complicated anymore to

1847.6 --> 1851.84
produce it

1853.12 --> 1856.799
it doesn't even require lots of

1855.2 --> 1859.8400000000001
electricity or anything

1856.799 --> 1865.84
not that much don't think more than

1859.84 --> 1865.84
any regular lamp

1876.84 --> 1879.84
uh

1892.799 --> 1895.12
hmm

1899.36 --> 1902.7199999999998
okay neil constantine i don't know what

1900.88 --> 1908.0
you meant with that

1902.72 --> 1911.2
vinyl composition tile it's slot

1908.0 --> 1914.799
lots i take it of labor but the

1911.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
do the math i'm trying to get to

1914.799 --> 1921.84
the other 50 per feet what

1925.519 --> 1935.84
you mean you're producing this thing and

1928.0 --> 1935.84
then selling it

1950.88 --> 1954.159
huh okay here we go again i haven't

1953.279 --> 1958.24
heard of that

1954.159 --> 1962.0
movie before official secrets

1958.24 --> 1964.799
is that a recent movie

1962.0 --> 1964.799
never heard of that

1966.72 --> 1977.84
okay illegal war in iraq so it can't be

1968.799 --> 1977.84
more than 20 years old at least

1982.64 --> 1987.6000000000001
if we light spectrum requires density

1984.88 --> 1990.7990000000002
well yes foul lambo cannon

1987.6 --> 1991.6
but the thing is the lamp doesn't have

1990.799 --> 1993.279
to be open

1991.6 --> 1995.76
it's not like oh you move the box to the

1993.279 --> 1999.12
lamp no it goes through a conveyor belt

1995.76 --> 2000.24
inside of a closed box that's closed off

1999.12 --> 2003.36
with

2000.24 --> 2004.32
it with a with a flexible cover like a

2003.36 --> 2006.8799999999999
rubber seal

2004.32 --> 2008.1589999999999
thing that's just gonna fall closed and

2006.88 --> 2011.6000000000001
then inside

2008.159 --> 2012.88
it's gonna get radiated people that work

2011.6 --> 2015.279
around that

2012.88 --> 2016.159
are not going to be staring into the uv

2015.279 --> 2018.96
light or anything

2016.159 --> 2021.8400000000001
right so that shouldn't be that

2018.96 --> 2021.8400000000001
shouldn't be a problem

2029.519 --> 2033.84
2019 okay

2039.12 --> 2047.84
thank you man young i do my best to make

2042.799 --> 2047.84
goddamn sense

2055.679 --> 2058.32
right so

2058.72 --> 2063.4399999999996
this movie is it like on netflix or

2062.399 --> 2075.839
something

2063.44 --> 2075.839
where can i find it

2076.639 --> 2089.839
okay i'll check it

2105.28 --> 2108.88
doesn't seem to be a netflix

2115.2 --> 2117.839
all right

2119.28 --> 2124.5600000000004
oh yeah download yeah yeah i could do

2121.599 --> 2124.56
that i guess

2126.32 --> 2131.839
okay let me do that

2163.44 --> 2165.76
oh

2167.04 --> 2173.839
it's not finding it

2181.68 --> 2187.5989999999997
oh wait official and confidential is no

2184.16 --> 2191.359
that's an e-book

2187.599 --> 2191.3590000000004
no i i'm not finding it

2195.839 --> 2201.839
yeah i just looked and i'm not finding

2198.839 --> 2201.839
it

2204.32 --> 2208.7200000000003
oh neil constantino dude dude dude just

2207.2 --> 2212.16
take care of your family okay

2208.72 --> 2216.24
you're living in freaking new york

2212.16 --> 2216.24
i've already got so much support today

2217.599 --> 2223.44
right i do appreciate the gesture though

2222.079 --> 2227.119
but

2223.44 --> 2229.839
like hulu

2227.119 --> 2229.839
what

2231.04 --> 2236.32
ah the adjustment bureau yeah i watched

2233.2 --> 2236.3199999999997
that uh a while ago

2241.28 --> 2248.88
huh okay here we go again

2244.4 --> 2248.88
uh well

2249.119 --> 2256.1600000000003
if you still have it in your torrent

2252.24 --> 2259.68
downloader then maybe you could

2256.16 --> 2262.8799999999997
basically give the torret link raw

2259.68 --> 2265.839
over skype just give the link its

2262.88 --> 2268.0
huge text pretty much she could just

2265.839 --> 2269.92
copy it

2268.0 --> 2272.64
and then put it in skype then i should

2269.92 --> 2275.599
be able to just directly download it

2272.64 --> 2278.48
from the same source that you did that

2275.599 --> 2278.48
might be a solution

2279.2 --> 2283.04
but do it over skype not in the chat

2282.0 --> 2299.119
here of course

2283.04 --> 2301.52
it's not gonna fit anyway

2299.119 --> 2304.079
movies on hulu oh i i don't even know

2301.52 --> 2304.079
what that is

2306.88 --> 2313.599
is that some alternative to netflix or

2310.839 --> 2315.44
something

2313.599 --> 2317.04
all right no problem here we go again

2315.44 --> 2318.96
take your time it's just

2317.04 --> 2320.8
i'm not in a super hurry to watch it

2318.96 --> 2323.04
it's just that i can't find it

2320.8 --> 2324.6400000000003
but if you did download it through a

2323.04 --> 2328.16
torrent then you could literally

2324.64 --> 2331.2
link me up with that

2328.16 --> 2332.3999999999996
with the link itself the torrent link

2331.2 --> 2341.839
anyway

2332.4 --> 2341.839
thanks for the movie tip

2351.44 --> 2355.2000000000003
so yeah i get yeah it's a short show

2354.0 --> 2358.48
it's saturday

2355.2 --> 2362.7999999999997
got 15 more minutes so anything

2358.48 --> 2369.839
else you would like me to address

2362.8 --> 2369.8390000000004
some technical specific specificities

2394.839 --> 2397.839
um

2408.839 --> 2412.16
so

2410.48 --> 2413.68
you've been telling to watch the

2412.16 --> 2418.16
adjustment bureau

2413.68 --> 2422.56
well i did it's a netflix series right

2418.16 --> 2422.56
or was no way it was a movement a movie

2423.359 --> 2426.319
it was interesting

2429.28 --> 2433.28
i think i might still have it on my

2430.72 --> 2439.839
computer somewhere

2433.28 --> 2439.8390000000004
but i think i saw that a while ago

2443.839 --> 2447.52
all right you have our own buchanan look

2446.079 --> 2451.6800000000003
there's a lot of these sites

2447.52 --> 2453.839
that just kind of dump movies on them

2451.68 --> 2455.7599999999998
and then after a while they get taken

2453.839 --> 2467.2
down and you have to find another one

2455.76 --> 2470.96
i kind of try to avoid that

2467.2 --> 2470.96
and you about 15 more minutes

2478.4 --> 2482.1600000000003
right yes george sanford

2482.64 --> 2489.52
torrents are better but

2486.079 --> 2491.52
it also depends on how well seated the

2489.52 --> 2494.64
torrents are and torrents can

2491.52 --> 2499.359
technically be taken down

2494.64 --> 2501.7599999999998
so it's not a guarantee

2499.359 --> 2503.7599999999998
if you store every torrent you have that

2501.76 --> 2506.88
after like 20 years you're gonna

2503.76 --> 2522.7200000000003
try to redownload one that it's still

2506.88 --> 2526.6400000000003
there there's no guarantee of that

2522.72 --> 2530.0789999999997
once you have the file they don't go bad

2526.64 --> 2532.0789999999997
well if you keep the torrent active

2530.079 --> 2533.2000000000003
that people can literally download it

2532.079 --> 2536.8
from your computer

2533.2 --> 2538.48
if you keep it like that then yes

2536.8 --> 2551.8390000000004
then it does stay good because you're

2538.48 --> 2551.839
the one that's eating it

2556.16 --> 2560.96
yeah oh here we go without vpn i

2558.24 --> 2563.68
wouldn't have been able to

2560.96 --> 2565.92
do any torrents because in the

2563.68 --> 2568.0
netherlands especially like they

2565.92 --> 2569.6800000000003
like pirate bay they don't even allow

2568.0 --> 2573.92
you to go there

2569.68 --> 2573.9199999999996
so it only works with vpn ever

2574.88 --> 2580.079
i had to download the opera browser

2577.76 --> 2581.5200000000004
which has a standard vpn system in it

2580.079 --> 2584.7200000000003
for free

2581.52 --> 2593.839
just to go there

2584.72 --> 2593.839
i don't really use it for anything else

2598.72 --> 2605.52
yeah george sanford yeah a couple

2602.16 --> 2608.72
yeah a decade ago and more like

2605.52 --> 2609.7599999999998
there was this technology boom with dvds

2608.72 --> 2612.0789999999997
and stuff

2609.76 --> 2614.4
so suddenly people could easily burn a

2612.079 --> 2615.52
movie on a dvd on a relatively good

2614.4 --> 2617.92
quality

2615.52 --> 2619.359
and a lot of people were doing that but

2617.92 --> 2621.04
nowadays

2619.359 --> 2622.56
it's almost not even worth it anymore

2621.04 --> 2623.119
because if you find the right sources

2622.56 --> 2626.0
you could just

2623.119 --> 2629.28
almost instantly download it on like

2626.0 --> 2629.28
maximum quality

2630.319 --> 2634.96
so that yeah burning everything on dvds

2633.2 --> 2637.52
that was very typical pretty much

2634.96 --> 2649.839
up until 10 years ago and then just

2637.52 --> 2649.839
downloading became easier

2658.0 --> 2663.839
hmm all right didn't know that

2688.839 --> 2691.839
right

2717.359 --> 2724.16
right yeah there's some pretty big usb

2720.72 --> 2725.1189999999997
sticks and stuff now so you can put just

2724.16 --> 2728.64
several

2725.119 --> 2733.839
high-res quality movies on there

2728.64 --> 2733.839
in today's time

2736.0 --> 2740.4
like usb sticks are almost like just

2740.88 --> 2744.8
small ssd discs

2744.88 --> 2761.839
they're becoming really big as well

2772.839 --> 2775.839
see

2777.04 --> 2784.48
oh yeah neil put posted

2780.319 --> 2784.48
but the earth's hidden inner core

2786.839 --> 2803.839
see

2788.72 --> 2803.839
a mystery cooling event what

2814.839 --> 2817.839
what

2820.16 --> 2823.2
that's hilarious

2823.44 --> 2831.359
wow somebody really went nuts with this

2827.2 --> 2835.839
that's that's hilarious man

2831.359 --> 2837.2799999999997
it's a good find neil i'll post the link

2835.839 --> 2845.839
other people could take a look as well

2837.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
it's it's very silly but

2846.8 --> 2859.8390000000004
if you read it all it's all mathematical

2850.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
i would not be surprised one bit

2867.839 --> 2876.16
monkey 3d yeah i remember those days

2872.559 --> 2880.1600000000003
the 90s hard disks

2876.16 --> 2882.64
yeah damn those were expensive

2880.16 --> 2885.1189999999997
in the 80s was even worse the 80s it was

2882.64 --> 2886.0789999999997
like extreme luxury but then again back

2885.119 --> 2889.28
then the data

2886.079 --> 2892.48
packages weren't that fast at all so

2889.28 --> 2892.48
it was a lot of space

2894.88 --> 2898.7200000000003
you know there really is like a big

2897.839 --> 2901.92
information

2898.72 --> 2904.7999999999997
inflation going on it's oh

2901.92 --> 2906.48
we got so much stuff we need more space

2904.8 --> 2909.599
okay so there's more space

2906.48 --> 2910.96
now made bigger discs okay so oh oh look

2909.599 --> 2914.48
we got all this room okay

2910.96 --> 2915.52
well let's make files bigger oh we don't

2914.48 --> 2918.319
have any more space

2915.52 --> 2920.319
because oh well let's make it bigger

2918.319 --> 2921.119
storage disk then oh look we got all

2920.319 --> 2922.48
this room well

2921.119 --> 2924.8
let's just make the files a little

2922.48 --> 2929.839
bigger then and that's been going on for

2924.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
several decades now

2933.599 --> 2937.52
i sometimes think it's even artificially

2936.64 --> 2941.44
stimulated

2937.52 --> 2941.44
like companies

2941.76 --> 2946.4
conspire i guess well it's not even a

2944.24 --> 2949.52
big conspiracy it's just logical

2946.4 --> 2952.88
that programming software companies

2949.52 --> 2952.88
would conspire with

2953.2 --> 2959.359
with hardware companies

2957.119 --> 2960.2400000000002
to just make their programmers of games

2959.359 --> 2963.68
use

2960.24 --> 2966.5589999999997
the newest engine that is bigger

2963.68 --> 2969.2
rougher and that oh that could appeal to

2966.559 --> 2971.92
the better technology so it'll force

2969.2 --> 2975.68
people to buy a bigger computer

2971.92 --> 2978.079
bigger graphics card i think that's

2975.68 --> 2978.8799999999997
like a conspiracy that's kind of a plain

2978.079 --> 2982.6400000000003
sight

2978.88 --> 2984.7200000000003
like people don't even think about it as

2982.64 --> 2985.92
a conspiracy because it's so blatantly

2984.72 --> 2989.52
obvious

2985.92 --> 2990.64
you know because there's just this thing

2989.52 --> 2993.44
going around but you

2990.64 --> 2994.16
have to use the most up-to-date the

2993.44 --> 2996.48
newest

2994.16 --> 2998.3999999999996
graphics little trick and oh yeah yeah

2996.48 --> 3000.079
it takes bigger hardware

2998.4 --> 3002.079
right like it's some secondary thought

3000.079 --> 3004.1600000000003
like oh it takes bigger hardware oh well

3002.079 --> 3006.079
i have to do it oh why do you have to do

3004.16 --> 3006.72
it oh because you did the bigger

3006.079 --> 3009.2000000000003
hardware

3006.72 --> 3013.839
need to be sold yeah yeah we know it's

3009.2 --> 3013.839
blatantly obvious

3028.8 --> 3033.8390000000004
yeah yeah isn't it amazing neil

3031.92 --> 3035.92
oh it's really because of the speed of

3033.839 --> 3038.88
light

3035.92 --> 3040.8
you know why is it so quick why are the

3038.88 --> 3043.839
interactions not

3040.8 --> 3047.04
waiting a minute before you get through

3043.839 --> 3049.68
it's because it's not dependent on

3047.04 --> 3052.88
radio signal communication it's going

3049.68 --> 3052.8799999999997
through a giant beam

3053.119 --> 3057.6800000000003
through the middle of the ocean it's all

3056.0 --> 3061.119
light based it's all this

3057.68 --> 3064.24
super heavy optic fiber

3061.119 --> 3067.119
communication which it uses light

3064.24 --> 3068.0789999999997
to do it over vast vast distances it's

3067.119 --> 3072.0
extremely

3068.079 --> 3075.92
quick very fast so that is really what

3072.0 --> 3078.559
allows this communication to be so quick

3075.92 --> 3083.839
it's because we're communicating at

3078.559 --> 3083.8390000000004
light speed

3085.2 --> 3088.48
right if these cables were not there and

3087.44 --> 3091.839
we would have to do

3088.48 --> 3095.28
everything through freaking radio towers

3091.839 --> 3097.2799999999997
internet would be a mess you would not

3095.28 --> 3099.3590000000004
be able to properly face-to-face

3097.28 --> 3101.92
communicate over the internet

3099.359 --> 3103.839
if somebody was not just in your direct

3101.92 --> 3106.48
region

3103.839 --> 3107.599
it's really the fiber optics that allows

3106.48 --> 3110.319
this seemingly

3107.599 --> 3113.52
instant communication with maybe a

3110.319 --> 3113.52
couple of seconds delay

3114.0 --> 3119.2
over yeah half the earth distance

3119.359 --> 3122.96
what's the maximum distance for fiber

3121.2 --> 3125.04
optics i don't think there is a maximum

3122.96 --> 3126.0
distance for fiber optics it's just that

3125.04 --> 3128.48
the bigger

3126.0 --> 3129.52
the longer the the traveling path for

3128.48 --> 3131.68
the

3129.52 --> 3132.8
for the information through fiber optics

3131.68 --> 3135.839
is

3132.8 --> 3136.319
the delay will grow slightly it is just

3135.839 --> 3138.7999999999997
so

3136.319 --> 3141.68
it's almost insignificant because light

3138.8 --> 3141.6800000000003
is really fast

3150.48 --> 3155.599
right so the most of the delay even is

3153.52 --> 3157.839
not because of the fiber optic cable

3155.599 --> 3159.3590000000004
distance it's because of the transition

3157.839 --> 3162.16
stations

3159.359 --> 3162.88
right where it has to basically transit

3162.16 --> 3167.44
into

3162.88 --> 3170.079
electronic form like electric

3167.44 --> 3172.079
communication instead of light fiber

3170.079 --> 3174.319
optics based communication because most

3172.079 --> 3176.1600000000003
internet you know you don't plug in a

3174.319 --> 3177.119
fiber optic cable directly in your

3176.16 --> 3180.16
computer

3177.119 --> 3182.1600000000003
that part is electric wire

3180.16 --> 3184.0
and then after it goes to central

3182.16 --> 3186.24
stations and then from that central

3184.0 --> 3187.52
station is usually where the fiber optic

3186.24 --> 3190.24
cable

3187.52 --> 3190.24
takes over

3192.559 --> 3196.3190000000004
and that's where it goes really fast

3194.16 --> 3198.5589999999997
from that point so it's really kind of

3196.319 --> 3200.48
like hub to hop and the distance towards

3198.559 --> 3202.6400000000003
the hop from your location

3200.48 --> 3203.92
that's really the the most of where the

3202.64 --> 3209.839
delay comes from

3203.92 --> 3209.839
the delay that's still left

3212.96 --> 3217.119
still insane to me but great yeah that's

3215.839 --> 3220.72
fine

3217.119 --> 3223.92
hey fiber optics is the best

3220.72 --> 3226.319
thing ever in my opinion all

3223.92 --> 3228.079
radio towers should probably just well a

3226.319 --> 3229.92
bit over dramatic but

3228.079 --> 3232.0
i wouldn't mind one bit if they were all

3229.92 --> 3233.04
taken down and just everything became

3232.0 --> 3236.48
optics

3233.04 --> 3239.92
optical wire everything just everywhere

3236.48 --> 3243.68
optical wire with maybe a couple of

3239.92 --> 3244.0
emergency radio communication systems

3243.68 --> 3246.5589999999997
for

3244.0 --> 3247.76
say disaster situation let's say there's

3246.559 --> 3250.2400000000002
a giant earthquake

3247.76 --> 3251.599
earth shift cables are caught yeah

3250.24 --> 3253.839
that's a problem right

3251.599 --> 3255.6800000000003
well then you can put in the radio to

3253.839 --> 3257.04
activate the radio tower to kind of

3255.68 --> 3260.48
bridge

3257.04 --> 3263.2
that break until it can be fixed right

3260.48 --> 3265.839
that in my opinion would be the west the

3263.2 --> 3265.839
best way

3266.079 --> 3270.559
to set things up when it comes to the

3268.079 --> 3270.559
internet

3276.839 --> 3281.52
right

3278.799 --> 3282.24
how do the signals know which path to go

3281.52 --> 3285.92
to get

3282.24 --> 3290.24
to the right destination well that's

3285.92 --> 3290.2400000000002
oh there well that's like uh

3291.68 --> 3295.44
yeah that's the protocols it's the pro

3293.68 --> 3299.44
it's just the protocols

3295.44 --> 3302.0
i i'm not a communication network

3299.44 --> 3302.64
expert because it is kind of its own

3302.0 --> 3307.2
thing

3302.64 --> 3309.839
you know

3307.2 --> 3310.319
it's not as basic as you would think

3309.839 --> 3313.92
it's

3310.319 --> 3315.599
it's it's quite amazing that it can work

3313.92 --> 3318.799
on such a fast skill

3315.599 --> 3320.319
so fluently really but that's because of

3318.799 --> 3322.319
the programmers that

3320.319 --> 3325.04
and the engineers that were able to

3322.319 --> 3328.079
basically figure out a way to do it

3325.04 --> 3330.72
with protocols and information

3328.079 --> 3332.079
integrity package checking and all that

3330.72 --> 3336.0789999999997
it's pretty amazing

3332.079 --> 3340.6400000000003
i had some basic education about that

3336.079 --> 3343.599
like in follow-up studies after school

3340.64 --> 3345.7599999999998
so i did get look into it a bit it's

3343.599 --> 3347.3590000000004
fascinating

3345.76 --> 3348.96
that it's really thanks to all the

3347.359 --> 3351.5989999999997
protocols that were

3348.96 --> 3363.839
designed for the internet that makes it

3351.599 --> 3363.839
run so smooth as it is

3374.799 --> 3391.839
yeah well neil

3378.0 --> 3391.839
what can you do you know

3393.28 --> 3396.7200000000003
i think a lot of people have those types

3395.2 --> 3399.2799999999997
of stories

3396.72 --> 3400.16
if they only knew all those years ago

3399.28 --> 3403.28
well

3400.16 --> 3405.7599999999998
if only you knew when bitcoin was 10

3403.28 --> 3407.0400000000004
euros a coin yeah if you only knew yeah

3405.76 --> 3410.2400000000002
yeah

3407.04 --> 3419.839
this is a it's a story that a lot of

3410.24 --> 3419.839
people have

3422.24 --> 3426.0789999999997
all right but i think that fiber optics

3424.4 --> 3427.599
is going to get a big comeback though

3426.079 --> 3430.7200000000003
that's my personal

3427.599 --> 3434.079
oh geez

3430.72 --> 3436.319
damn clouds bursting check it out

3434.079 --> 3436.319
man

3439.2 --> 3444.3999999999996
i can't see that but yeah it's raining

3441.76 --> 3444.4
pretty hard

3444.88 --> 3452.0
but uh yeah look once the issues

3448.48 --> 3455.359
with the mobiles

3452.0 --> 3457.2
and radio communication with mobiles and

3455.359 --> 3459.7599999999998
everything once this started to

3457.2 --> 3461.4399999999996
go peak and people are gonna get sick of

3459.76 --> 3464.1600000000003
it and it's gonna show that it is

3461.44 --> 3465.28
indeed bad for people's health to

3464.16 --> 3468.16
constantly

3465.28 --> 3470.0
subject themselves to wi-fi and 5g

3468.16 --> 3471.92
radiation and all that on a constant

3470.0 --> 3475.68
basis

3471.92 --> 3479.6800000000003
then eventually we must

3475.68 --> 3483.04
we must return to fiber optics

3479.68 --> 3486.799
more than ever and it's going to be all

3483.04 --> 3486.799
about protecting those cables

3487.599 --> 3494.4
right so at some point this

3491.599 --> 3496.079
radio tower madness and the satellite

3494.4 --> 3499.52
nonsense and all that

3496.079 --> 3501.8390000000004
at some point it's going to break

3499.52 --> 3503.359
because it's guess guess who's who's in

3501.839 --> 3505.599
control of that [ __ ]

3503.359 --> 3507.119
it's the same people that are conspiring

3505.599 --> 3510.559
eugenicists

3507.119 --> 3513.2000000000003
right it's their side project their mind

3510.559 --> 3514.96
control side project and it's

3513.2 --> 3517.04
all that [ __ ] well at some point it's

3514.96 --> 3519.2
going to break

3517.04 --> 3520.5589999999997
it's going to go down again interest is

3519.2 --> 3523.7599999999998
going to go down industries

3520.559 --> 3527.0400000000004
it's going to fail in that regard

3523.76 --> 3528.2400000000002
i predict that and then yeah the

3527.04 --> 3532.319
countries that are going to

3528.24 --> 3535.5989999999997
decide okay let's move on

3532.319 --> 3537.04
so how are we gonna rebuild the internet

3535.599 --> 3539.839
with everything we've learned in the

3537.04 --> 3542.839
newer technologies well

3539.839 --> 3544.88
fiber optic cables everywhere

3542.839 --> 3548.4
standardized you know

3544.88 --> 3551.839
if you can standardize building

3548.4 --> 3554.7200000000003
houses through modules like module

3551.839 --> 3556.0
production if you're going to go into

3554.72 --> 3559.1189999999997
that direction

3556.0 --> 3562.64
they should damn well standardized

3559.119 --> 3564.559
fiber optics in everything everything

3562.64 --> 3566.96
should have a fiber optic cable

3564.559 --> 3568.96
connector to it so that everywhere you

3566.96 --> 3569.52
could be connected directly to the fiber

3568.96 --> 3571.92
optic and

3569.52 --> 3574.24
ins or seemingly instantly communicate

3571.92 --> 3577.839
to anywhere else in the world

3574.24 --> 3580.799
yeah and it's the funny thing it's

3577.839 --> 3582.0789999999997
fiber optics fiber optics is really

3580.799 --> 3584.96
cheap

3582.079 --> 3586.0
it's really freaking cheap and durable

3584.96 --> 3589.119
it doesn't wear

3586.0 --> 3593.68
out it's

3589.119 --> 3593.6800000000003
super cheap it doesn't wear out

3594.559 --> 3600.0
so that's my prediction at some point it

3597.68 --> 3601.68
like this radio tower madness is going

3600.0 --> 3603.599
to be over and then it's going to be

3601.68 --> 3604.8799999999997
pure optic cable

3603.599 --> 3606.48
and they're going to go everywhere you

3604.88 --> 3607.599
know they're going to go through forest

3606.48 --> 3609.92
as well and then they're going to be

3607.599 --> 3612.559
hippies

3609.92 --> 3614.319
don't put that in here so then people

3612.559 --> 3615.599
are going to say oh really so you want

3614.319 --> 3618.72
to put a radio

3615.599 --> 3621.839
tower instead to overbridge that

3618.72 --> 3624.48
huh you want that because radio towers

3621.839 --> 3627.119
have been proven to be detrimental for

3624.48 --> 3630.2400000000002
nature so you want that instead

3627.119 --> 3632.6400000000003
okay put the damn cable in right

3630.24 --> 3633.839
that's what's gonna happen and that's

3632.64 --> 3636.319
gonna be everywhere

3633.839 --> 3637.92
and we're gonna be very happy about it

3636.319 --> 3641.359
and a lot of people are even

3637.92 --> 3642.799
gonna forget that it is everywhere and

3641.359 --> 3645.2799999999997
they're just gonna be like oh

3642.799 --> 3647.04
you have a plug when you connect you

3645.28 --> 3648.48
connect anywhere to the world how does

3647.04 --> 3657.839
this work

3648.48 --> 3657.839
who cares it works

3659.839 --> 3666.4
yeah steamy traveler that's a good point

3662.96 --> 3670.079
but that's what i'm saying also

3666.4 --> 3673.28
cell phones cell phones are gonna get

3670.079 --> 3673.8390000000004
more problematic for many different

3673.28 --> 3676.4
reasons

3673.839 --> 3677.2
they're gonna get a lot more problematic

3676.4 --> 3680.079
they're gonna

3677.2 --> 3681.2
show and reveal more and more health

3680.079 --> 3684.4
issues

3681.2 --> 3686.64
both physical and psychological

3684.4 --> 3688.319
until at a point it's going to be kind

3686.64 --> 3690.0
of like sworn off

3688.319 --> 3691.359
and they're going to be probably rules

3690.0 --> 3693.04
at some point that they're just going to

3691.359 --> 3695.04
say okay

3693.04 --> 3696.48
if you're under 16 you're not allowed to

3695.04 --> 3698.88
have a mobile

3696.48 --> 3699.52
because it's it's like literally like

3698.88 --> 3702.559
kids

3699.52 --> 3703.28
smoking you know kids are not allowed to

3702.559 --> 3706.2400000000002
smoke

3703.28 --> 3708.1600000000003
why because it is a major detriment to

3706.24 --> 3709.1189999999997
their health in their growth period well

3708.16 --> 3712.319
guess what

3709.119 --> 3713.92
mobile phones is the same yeah

3712.319 --> 3716.5589999999997
well once that's going to shift then

3713.92 --> 3719.039
that booming youth market

3716.559 --> 3720.96
is going to end and then suddenly the

3719.039 --> 3722.7990000000004
whole thing is going to tumble in on

3720.96 --> 3724.96
itself because they don't have any more

3722.799 --> 3726.24
mind control victims to program to

3724.96 --> 3729.119
become total

3726.24 --> 3730.3999999999996
mobile phone addicts for the rest of

3729.119 --> 3732.799
their lives

3730.4 --> 3734.1600000000003
so their feeding trough for the mobile

3732.799 --> 3737.839
phone industry is done

3734.16 --> 3740.799
gonna die down that's why since the 90s

3737.839 --> 3741.2799999999997
they've been just adamantly denying that

3740.799 --> 3743.28
there is

3741.28 --> 3744.88
any kind of detriment to holding a

3743.28 --> 3746.799
mobile phone next to your head even

3744.88 --> 3748.6400000000003
though in your rooty instructions you

3746.799 --> 3751.44
got to keep it at

3748.64 --> 3754.5589999999997
at one meter distance at all time it's

3751.44 --> 3756.079
in the instructions right but that's not

3754.559 --> 3759.039
over that's just

3756.079 --> 3760.0
to prevent getting sued they keep it a

3759.039 --> 3763.3590000000004
secret though

3760.0 --> 3766.839
right so at some point it's

3763.359 --> 3769.839
all gonna come tumbling down it's

3766.839 --> 3769.839
inevitable

3778.72 --> 3782.8799999999997
buried fiber optics has trouble with

3781.2 --> 3785.52
lightning strikes

3782.88 --> 3786.7200000000003
well it shouldn't have to if that is

3785.52 --> 3791.52
really a problem

3786.72 --> 3793.68
then yeah lightning rods done

3791.52 --> 3795.599
you know you could even literally make

3793.68 --> 3797.1189999999997
fiber optics if they're very important

3795.599 --> 3800.319
in a way

3797.119 --> 3800.96
that like lightning can't hurt it it'll

3800.319 --> 3804.72
have

3800.96 --> 3807.44
automatic electric grounding

3804.72 --> 3808.8799999999997
so that whatever strikes it it's just

3807.44 --> 3809.2000000000003
gonna go straight into the ground and

3808.88 --> 3812.2400000000002
not

3809.2 --> 3816.48
even influence the fiber optics

3812.24 --> 3819.5989999999997
right all that can all be engineered

3816.48 --> 3821.28
to be pretty much flawless right

3819.599 --> 3822.96
until the only thing that could

3821.28 --> 3825.28
technically break it

3822.96 --> 3827.599
is a total meltdown of the central

3825.28 --> 3829.76
distribution hubs of information

3827.599 --> 3832.0
in between all the fiber optics cables

3829.76 --> 3834.0
or giant earthquakes that are literally

3832.0 --> 3835.52
gonna rip them all apart

3834.0 --> 3837.119
that's the only thing that's then at

3835.52 --> 3840.559
that point gonna

3837.119 --> 3842.7200000000003
damage it or maybe just

3840.559 --> 3843.92
giant fires yeah of course eventually it

3842.72 --> 3846.64
could melt

3843.92 --> 3848.7200000000003
right but other than just massive

3846.64 --> 3851.92
disasters it's not gonna be

3848.72 --> 3852.9599999999996
disrupted it might be sabotage you know

3851.92 --> 3854.48
people could

3852.96 --> 3856.079
terrorists could freaking blow it up but

3854.48 --> 3859.039
that's why i said

3856.079 --> 3860.1600000000003
when this unfolds then there's going to

3859.039 --> 3862.7200000000003
have to be

3860.16 --> 3865.359
probably some groups that are going to

3862.72 --> 3866.9599999999996
secure the fiber optic cables against

3865.359 --> 3868.72
terrorists

3866.96 --> 3870.16
that's probably going to become a thing

3868.72 --> 3873.1189999999997
at some point but that might

3870.16 --> 3875.2
take a decade or maybe more before we

3873.119 --> 3876.4
even get close to that

3875.2 --> 3881.839
we still have to deal with the

3876.4 --> 3881.839
situations at hand first

3886.88 --> 3889.92
called job security

3893.839 --> 3896.96
is there a difference if you have your

3895.28 --> 3899.44
cell phone on speaker as opposed to

3896.96 --> 3899.839
holding a text to here oh my god neil if

3899.44 --> 3903.359
you

3899.839 --> 3905.7599999999998
know if you only knew yes

3903.359 --> 3910.88
massive difference massive massive

3905.76 --> 3914.559
difference because the signal intensity

3910.88 --> 3916.799
is exponential over distance

3914.559 --> 3917.6800000000003
or rather the opposite so if you hold it

3916.799 --> 3919.359
next to your head

3917.68 --> 3921.5989999999997
you're going to be subjected with the

3919.359 --> 3925.68
maximum blast

3921.599 --> 3929.119
you keep it at like 10 centimeters

3925.68 --> 3930.0
okay this is a metaphorical example i

3929.119 --> 3933.2000000000003
don't know the

3930.0 --> 3935.119
literal numerics of this but i know that

3933.2 --> 3937.2799999999997
it is exponential so i'm just as an

3935.119 --> 3938.6400000000003
example saying okay so if you keep it 10

3937.28 --> 3940.6400000000003
centimeters away

3938.64 --> 3942.48
it's going to be half of that intensity

3940.64 --> 3944.8799999999997
if you keep it another

3942.48 --> 3946.799
10 centimeters away it's going to be a

3944.88 --> 3950.48
quarter etc etc

3946.799 --> 3952.72
right yes it matters

3950.48 --> 3954.4
i don't know the exact intensity

3952.72 --> 3957.4399999999996
difference but i know

3954.4 --> 3959.76
from studies long ago

3957.44 --> 3962.0
having seen that that it is exponential

3959.76 --> 3964.1600000000003
over distance so you should absolutely

3962.0 --> 3966.88
keep quite a distance through your

3964.16 --> 3970.3999999999996
mobile and your head

3966.88 --> 3979.839
especially when you're calling i always

3970.4 --> 3979.839
do that

3985.68 --> 3993.839
huh well neil your wife is very smart

4036.96 --> 4040.88
right yeah random explorer is correct

4039.2 --> 4044.319
about that part

4040.88 --> 4046.4
like those mobile internet traffic

4044.319 --> 4048.0
communication towers they could not

4046.4 --> 4050.48
function without fiber optic

4048.0 --> 4051.839
connection because it would slow down

4050.48 --> 4054.16
everything dramatically

4051.839 --> 4057.7599999999998
if they didn't have that it would not it

4054.16 --> 4057.7599999999998
would be very disruptive

4059.76 --> 4065.119
so i think he's right about that

4063.039 --> 4067.039
if it's if the tower is supposed to have

4065.119 --> 4068.1600000000003
internet connection capability there's

4067.039 --> 4071.119
going to be have to be

4068.16 --> 4071.44
fiber optics connecting to it or it's

4071.119 --> 4076.4
just

4071.44 --> 4080.079
going to be extremely slow

4076.4 --> 4082.88
how do hammer radios work i don't know

4080.079 --> 4091.8390000000004
they send the signal and the signal goes

4082.88 --> 4091.839
over distance and then is received

4104.239 --> 4110.48
is bt earpiece i don't know what bt

4107.279 --> 4114.159000000001
earpiece means stone monkey 3d

4110.48 --> 4116.5599999999995
but i know that wireless stuff

4114.159 --> 4117.3589999999995
like wireless headphones is not good

4116.56 --> 4119.52
either

4117.359 --> 4121.359
now the amount of information passing

4119.52 --> 4123.040000000001
through there is probably not too

4121.359 --> 4126.799
dramatic

4123.04 --> 4131.12
so a earpiece wireless earpiece

4126.799 --> 4133.6
would be less radio damages

4131.12 --> 4134.239
damaging than just the mobile next to

4133.6 --> 4137.6
your ear

4134.239 --> 4137.599999999999
but it still wouldn't be great

4144.88 --> 4161.1990000000005
just go for wires whenever you can and

4147.12 --> 4164.159
wires are always better

4161.199 --> 4164.159
long time no see

4167.759 --> 4172.799
oh right bt bluetooth bluetooth is

4172.839 --> 4178.239
terrible

4174.64 --> 4189.839
is terrible

4178.239 --> 4189.839
it's not good at all

4201.28 --> 4207.599999999999
all right bluetooth is

4204.64 --> 4209.280000000001
is so unhealthy i don't even know

4207.6 --> 4211.280000000001
anymore why i just

4209.28 --> 4214.84
the first few times i read up on that is

4211.28 --> 4216.719
just like i'm never gonna use that [ __ ]

4214.84 --> 4219.04
ever never

4216.719 --> 4220.32
right if there's some new car that for

4219.04 --> 4221.04
some reason i would get and they would

4220.32 --> 4223.04
say oh look

4221.04 --> 4224.96
it has bluetooth capability i'd say okay

4223.04 --> 4227.36
i demand you turn that off

4224.96 --> 4228.96
permanently disconnect the wire so that

4227.36 --> 4232.799999999999
it cannot be turned on

4228.96 --> 4235.28
you get it you must uninstall that you

4232.8 --> 4237.679
must or i'm not gonna buy it that's

4235.28 --> 4245.84
what's gonna happen

4237.679 --> 4245.84
because it's terrible many ways

4268.56 --> 4274.159000000001
this all right well stone monkey 3

4272.0 --> 4276.239
i'm not even talking about reliability

4274.159 --> 4279.36
of connections i'm just talking about

4276.239 --> 4282.879999999999
health and security alone

4279.36 --> 4286.239
it's terrible it's an

4282.88 --> 4287.6
old concept that's no law

4286.239 --> 4290.639999999999
it shouldn't be applied anymore it

4287.6 --> 4293.679
should be taken out it's not good

4290.64 --> 4301.84
it's heavily outdated there's so many

4293.679 --> 4301.84
better systems now

4310.4 --> 4313.599999999999
all right i'm gonna run out the show by

4312.08 --> 4316.64
the way i've been

4313.6 --> 4318.159000000001
going on for 15 minutes extra but it was

4316.64 --> 4321.84
interesting it was interesting bringing

4318.159 --> 4321.839999999999
that up about the fiber optics

4322.48 --> 4325.678999999999
it is something that i am concerned

4324.239 --> 4328.32
about well concerned

4325.679 --> 4329.28
it has my interest internet i've always

4328.32 --> 4332.4
had like yeah

4329.28 --> 4334.239
internet internet is really important

4332.4 --> 4335.679
and there's development and there's

4334.239 --> 4338.32
certain things

4335.679 --> 4340.4800000000005
where we all need to go with it while

4338.32 --> 4342.0
the industry is trying to prevent that

4340.48 --> 4344.4
from happening because when it

4342.0 --> 4346.56
does it becomes decentralized and they

4344.4 --> 4348.719
lose their little money cow in it

4346.56 --> 4350.56
right they don't want that they want to

4348.719 --> 4353.12
enslave everybody

4350.56 --> 4355.360000000001
and kill everybody if necessary to

4353.12 --> 4358.0
ensure that enslavement yeah

4355.36 --> 4359.92
i don't want that i want that absolute

4358.0 --> 4362.4
decentralized freedom

4359.92 --> 4364.159
and it is possible it is mechanically

4362.4 --> 4367.199
possible

4364.159 --> 4369.92
so i'm going to keep striving for that

4367.199 --> 4371.28
maybe not super overtly but always

4369.92 --> 4373.76
indirectly

4371.28 --> 4374.719
the rest of my life that's where i want

4373.76 --> 4377.280000000001
things to go

4374.719 --> 4378.2390000000005
technological wise fiber optics

4377.28 --> 4380.8
everywhere

4378.239 --> 4380.799999999999
everywhere

4382.48 --> 4386.879999999999
and i'm gonna promote that the rest of

4384.56 --> 4390.320000000001
my life

4386.88 --> 4392.4800000000005
anyway i'm rounding out the show

4390.32 --> 4394.639999999999
i hope you enjoyed the extra 15 minutes

4392.48 --> 4397.04
bonus

4394.64 --> 4398.4800000000005
thanks for coming everyone i hope you

4397.04 --> 4398.8

4398.48 --> 4401.919999999999
good

4398.8 --> 4404.2390000000005
no flat earth subjects today but still

4401.92 --> 4405.12
interesting and yeah thanks so much for
