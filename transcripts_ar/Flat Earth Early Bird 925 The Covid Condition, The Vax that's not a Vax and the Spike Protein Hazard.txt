83.119 --> 87.6
so

84.479 --> 89.92
weather is

87.6 --> 89.91999999999999
hot

90.88 --> 96.24
there's a lot of trails

93.759 --> 99.479
being laid out up there you can see it

96.24 --> 99.479
pretty much

100.96 --> 104.64
last

102.079 --> 106.96
two hours i've been up pretty early

104.64 --> 109.6
today because i went to bed really early

106.96 --> 109.6
yesterday

111.2 --> 116.07900000000001
i did actually get to see them spray it

114.159 --> 117.52000000000001
but doesn't seem to be really forming

116.079 --> 119.91999999999999
any clouds

117.52 --> 121.28
just yet

119.92 --> 123.68
and it's kind of weird because this

121.28 --> 123.68
morning

123.84 --> 130.399
it was all clouded like i had actually

128.16 --> 132.79999999999998
like

130.399 --> 134.56
taking the sheet off my bed in the night

132.8 --> 137.12
and just slept under that because it was

134.56 --> 139.28
really hot in the night but then around

137.12 --> 141.44
nine o'clock in the morning it was

139.28 --> 143.12
really clouded and cold

141.44 --> 145.44
so i really kind of woke up a little bit

143.12 --> 147.59900000000002
chilly put my

145.44 --> 149.35999999999999
sheet back on

147.599 --> 152.23899999999998
or the

149.36 --> 153.68
put it back in

152.239 --> 156.16
but then yeah

153.68 --> 159.44
a few hours later it became really hot

156.16 --> 161.68
again so that was weird

159.44 --> 161.68
yeah

161.76 --> 165.04
anyway

162.879 --> 166.0
it's the

165.04 --> 167.599
it's

166.0 --> 172.28
tuesday

167.599 --> 172.28
the 15th of june 2021

176.16 --> 180.76
nobody's in chat just yet

186.8 --> 192.0
finally on time

189.84 --> 194.72
anyway uh

192.0 --> 194.72
yesterday

194.8 --> 198.76000000000002
was it doing again yesterday

212.4 --> 214.72
hmm

216.72 --> 221.599
a good servant first in chat

219.76 --> 224.0
hello

221.599 --> 224.0
morning

224.56 --> 227.56
oh

239.439 --> 243.04
man i still have like by the way issues

241.439 --> 245.35999999999999
with my tooth

243.04 --> 247.12
i i really think it's the lasagna i

245.36 --> 250.239
think i've been thinking about it

247.12 --> 252.959
carefully and i think it's actually the

250.239 --> 255.519
the bechamel sauce i think it's because

252.959 --> 257.84000000000003
there's like cow's milk

255.519 --> 259.84000000000003
mixed in it and heated i think that's

257.84 --> 262.4
doing the thing because every time i've

259.84 --> 265.84
had lasagna like

262.4 --> 267.52
next two hours after that

265.84 --> 269.919
even though every day it seemed to have

267.52 --> 272.24
died down my freaking tooth situation

269.919 --> 274.479
comes back so i really think that's it

272.24 --> 277.36
and it's weird because even through my

274.479 --> 281.36
freaking dark world visions from a long

277.36 --> 283.04
time ago there was this weird hint

281.36 --> 284.88
because i really like lasagna i've

283.04 --> 286.40000000000003
always liked lasagna i was

284.88 --> 288.71999999999997
from a kids

286.4 --> 290.79999999999995
age on really thought that's like my one

288.72 --> 292.56
of my favorite foods

290.8 --> 295.56
but apparently there's this thing about

292.56 --> 295.56
it

296.759 --> 301.40000000000003
tfj what is that

310.0 --> 313.6
so

311.28 --> 313.59999999999997
right

317.44 --> 321.52
so i think i'm gonna have to kind of

319.52 --> 323.12
skip it or figure out a way to make

321.52 --> 324.479
lasagna without

323.12 --> 327.28000000000003
that setup

324.479 --> 330.24
because every time i do and even years

327.28 --> 333.59999999999997
back i remember it's like i get

330.24 --> 333.6
issues with my teeth

333.68 --> 339.72
and back then it was like the the top

336.4 --> 339.71999999999997
left side

340.32 --> 346.479
it's hard to explain

343.44 --> 349.68
or if it's a short for something then

346.479 --> 349.68
what does that stand for

350.24 --> 353.84000000000003
pain in the jaw well

354.56 --> 357.68
yeah i guess

361.36 --> 367.84000000000003
but it's not really that bad

363.919 --> 367.84
it's just that for some reason

369.28 --> 372.08
it's sensitive

376.8 --> 380.40000000000003
and i think it's because of the

379.199 --> 383.6
the milk

380.4 --> 383.59999999999997
the heated milk in

383.919 --> 390.479
yeah in the lasagna in the cheese sauce

388.08 --> 392.31899999999996
and i i don't really respond all that

390.479 --> 394.15999999999997
well to cheese anyway

392.319 --> 396.16
but it's been tannable like when i get

394.16 --> 397.84000000000003
spaghetti and i put a little

396.16 --> 399.44
cheese

397.84 --> 401.919
on it

399.44 --> 404.08
cheesy powder that doesn't seem to bring

401.919 --> 406.31899999999996
a lot of trouble

404.08 --> 410.639
every time i have that lasagna

406.319 --> 410.639
i do so i really think it's that

411.52 --> 416.44
the temple roma believes

422.4 --> 424.56
that

423.52 --> 427.75899999999996
no

424.56 --> 429.52
no that's not it it's not

427.759 --> 432.40000000000003
the jaw muscle

429.52 --> 436.96
although it does get like

432.4 --> 440.23999999999995
nerve pain radiation issues

436.96 --> 442.23999999999995
so every time i have something in my jaw

440.24 --> 445.52
it does typically

442.24 --> 446.96000000000004
feed back onto the jaw muscles but those

445.52 --> 449.039
are not the problem i don't have a

446.96 --> 451.84
chronic problem with the jaw muscles or

449.039 --> 451.84
joined thank god

471.919 --> 476.31899999999996
now my issues seem to be

473.919 --> 476.31899999999996
mainly

476.72 --> 483.44000000000005
in the part of my jaw between my molars

480.879 --> 485.52000000000004
that's where the issue seems to arrive

483.44 --> 486.879
every time i get that lasagna or

485.52 --> 488.56
something like that

486.879 --> 490.24
and originally i thought like oh but

488.56 --> 493.759
that's because

490.24 --> 495.919
i ate lasagna bologna as a cell style

493.759 --> 497.44
with meat in it and then the cheese

495.919 --> 499.599
sauce and i always thought like well

497.44 --> 501.039
that seems to be a thing

499.599 --> 502.319
shouldn't be doing that so i've been

501.039 --> 505.039
preventing that for a long time i

502.319 --> 508.24
haven't eaten spaghetti even with meat i

505.039 --> 510.24
eat it vegan these days although yeah

508.24 --> 512.479
i'd put cheese on it that's not vegan

510.24 --> 513.919
anymore

512.479 --> 516.24
but

513.919 --> 518.8
it seems to be for me specifically a

516.24 --> 521.519
reaction to cheese sauce when there's

518.8 --> 523.12
milk involved

521.519 --> 525.2
i wonder if it would have the same

523.12 --> 527.76
reaction if it was all goat cheese goat

525.2 --> 529.279
milk face though but i don't really like

527.76 --> 531.04
the taste of that

529.279 --> 532.8389999999999
so

531.04 --> 536.88
i'd rather just

532.839 --> 538.6400000000001
skip and go to just regular spaghetti

536.88 --> 540.88
without cheese sauce

538.64 --> 543.88
and just some sprinkle cheese on it

540.88 --> 543.88
anyway

553.2 --> 557.36
and you know i was first kind of

554.8 --> 559.519
confronted with this envision style and

557.36 --> 561.2
this is when i was really young i would

559.519 --> 563.279
have like a weird

561.2 --> 565.36
feverish nightmare maybe it was even

563.279 --> 568.08
after i ate that

565.36 --> 569.12
i felt like oh i have

568.08 --> 571.36
pain

569.12 --> 572.8
a headache or something

571.36 --> 574.6
and then

572.8 --> 577.5999999999999
like literal weird demon

574.6 --> 580.0
personifications would offer me

577.6 --> 581.6800000000001
human form by the way there was

580.0 --> 583.44
something wrong with this

581.68 --> 585.1999999999999
they were offering me

583.44 --> 587.2790000000001
lasagna like oh you can have all the

585.2 --> 588.399
lasagna you want and i would be like oh

587.279 --> 590.64
i'm digging

588.399 --> 592.24
i'm gonna do that

590.64 --> 594.64
and then they would disapprove and they

592.24 --> 596.9590000000001
would laugh at me for making a mistake

594.64 --> 598.399
and i didn't understand at all it felt

596.959 --> 601.5189999999999
really bad

598.399 --> 601.519
so vision stuff

601.92 --> 605.04
so there was always like there's

603.2 --> 606.88
something wrong with lasagna in the back

605.04 --> 608.8
of my mind even though always my love

606.88 --> 610.24
for it would kind of like push that out

608.8 --> 612.24
of the way

610.24 --> 615.92
and now

612.24 --> 618.72
what is it 30 years later more

615.92 --> 622.88
it started to kind of like

618.72 --> 625.12
become cleared up what why

622.88 --> 627.279
why i had that vision

625.12 --> 629.44
because it's really like a

627.279 --> 632.399
bad seduction thing for me i really like

629.44 --> 634.24
it i'll ignore the bad side effects and

632.399 --> 636.959
then get the bad side effects and that's

634.24 --> 640.0790000000001
kind of like a micro sin maybe

636.959 --> 643.3599999999999
for me personally perhaps it just

640.079 --> 647.8389999999999
has this negative effect on me

643.36 --> 647.839
so yeah that's been on my mind

650.32 --> 657.0400000000001
i just started watching uh owen benjamin

655.36 --> 659.12
when benjamin's latest upload from

657.04 --> 661.36
yesterday only got to 15 minutes but it

659.12 --> 665.2
was real a lot of fun

661.36 --> 668.0
almost like wanna continue watching that

665.2 --> 671.399
it's a whole item about joe rogan again

668.0 --> 671.399
it's always hilarious

678.32 --> 683.2
i thought it was by the way pretty weird

680.32 --> 685.6
that yesterday the show ended with more

683.2 --> 688.1600000000001
upvotes than downvotes but then

685.6 --> 691.44
over the night apparently the trolls

688.16 --> 695.64
caught up and downvoted it again

691.44 --> 695.6400000000001
but not during the show yesterday

704.079 --> 708.4799999999999
all right

706.399 --> 710.399
where is everybody

708.48 --> 714.279
i mean good servants there in chat but

710.399 --> 714.279
where's everybody else

727.04 --> 730.04
weird

731.519 --> 735.519
ah there you go hello again

738.399 --> 743.519
something is strange like what

741.519 --> 746.839
somebody just

743.519 --> 746.839
popped in

760.24 --> 764.5600000000001
right oh by the way i have to report

762.48 --> 767.519
also that in the last what is it now two

764.56 --> 769.8389999999999
days i've been able to

767.519 --> 771.68
get really through to some people and

769.839 --> 775.12
warn them

771.68 --> 778.399
about the covet situation and the wax

775.12 --> 781.04
like two days ago i was able to

778.399 --> 784.8
communicate this to a girl that stands

781.04 --> 786.88
in the store where i typically go for

784.8 --> 789.4399999999999
a smoking filters

786.88 --> 792.48
and the guy that owns that shop like

789.44 --> 795.7600000000001
he's he's awesome and he's no he's known

792.48 --> 797.12
it for a long he's very clever

795.76 --> 799.04
and perceptive

797.12 --> 801.2
and he was the one originally coming to

799.04 --> 802.8
me like what do you think about all this

801.2 --> 804.72
this is weird isn't it so much

802.8 --> 807.3599999999999
conflicting stuff and doesn't seem to

804.72 --> 809.6800000000001
make sense and so i gave him my early

807.36 --> 813.2
analysis what i've seen through alex

809.68 --> 816.079
jones show and all the alternative media

813.2 --> 818.399
and like he was really like oh [ __ ]

816.079 --> 820.56
so my intuition kind of was correct

818.399 --> 822.72
thanks and i've been like buddies with

820.56 --> 824.8
him kind of doing like this

822.72 --> 826.88
covert talk about this every time i get

824.8 --> 830.399
there and he always really appreciates

826.88 --> 831.76
that but he has like a girl

830.399 --> 834.0
from italy

831.76 --> 836.959
who also works there instead of him

834.0 --> 836.959
sometimes and

837.68 --> 843.199
she hasn't been vaxxed or anything

840.639 --> 845.76
but yeah through her family a lot of

843.199 --> 846.4799999999999
issues but i i really got through to her

845.76 --> 848.0
like

846.48 --> 849.6800000000001
girl

848.0 --> 852.24
it's good that you haven't taken it but

849.68 --> 854.079
you have to be really careful

852.24 --> 856.0
and i kind of got through to her and i'm

854.079 --> 858.88
really happy about that saw some really

856.0 --> 860.88
good glimmers in her eyes and

858.88 --> 864.32
kind of made her attractive

860.88 --> 864.32
she's she's very cute

865.279 --> 869.72
little italian girl bright eyes

870.32 --> 875.6800000000001
very female anyway uh and then yesterday

874.32 --> 877.839
i talked to

875.68 --> 880.2399999999999
my neighbor like the one neighbor in the

877.839 --> 881.6800000000001
building that i typically

880.24 --> 883.76
bump into and then have just

881.68 --> 885.519
conversations about anything

883.76 --> 888.3199999999999
and yesterday

885.519 --> 890.9590000000001
i really got through to him and laid

888.32 --> 893.6
down a lot of details and i also noticed

890.959 --> 895.199
in him like he felt a little discouraged

893.6 --> 897.36
like oh [ __ ]

895.199 --> 899.12
is it really that bad but that makes no

897.36 --> 901.519
sense like why would they do this why

899.12 --> 901.519
did would they

901.839 --> 906.72
waste money to do this so i tried to

904.639 --> 907.92
roughly explain to them like yeah this

906.72 --> 910.839
is what

907.92 --> 914.56
real satanists do like they don't

910.839 --> 916.48
care it's like they're

914.56 --> 918.399
they waste their money because this is

916.48 --> 920.72
what they want right they want the

918.399 --> 922.56
depopulation they want

920.72 --> 924.0
the degradation of the minds of the

922.56 --> 926.6389999999999
people

924.0 --> 930.0
it was a tough thing for him to hear but

926.639 --> 932.639
i really piled on also

930.0 --> 935.36
referenced my insights even on what

932.639 --> 936.8
viruses are and everything lit yeah for

935.36 --> 938.639
the first time so he had a lot of

936.8 --> 941.12
information to take in but i did get

938.639 --> 943.759
through to him he hadn't taken the facts

941.12 --> 945.68
yet didn't plan to do it even

943.759 --> 949.36
before i informed him but now he'll

945.68 --> 949.3599999999999
definitely try to avoid it

949.759 --> 956.0790000000001
so i'm very proud that i'm still in the

952.399 --> 958.88
physical world around me i'm able to

956.079 --> 961.199
warn people

958.88 --> 963.36
right some others i have been less than

961.199 --> 966.079
successful one of the neighbor ladies

963.36 --> 967.839
older lady who one one time came to me

966.079 --> 970.959
like oh yeah i'm so happy i got the

967.839 --> 972.399
facts and i was like what are you doing

970.959 --> 974.16
don't take it

972.399 --> 976.959
you don't know what you're doing and she

974.16 --> 978.7199999999999
doesn't she's kind of been like

976.959 --> 980.4799999999999
out of it since i haven't been able to

978.72 --> 981.759
really properly communicate with her so

980.48 --> 983.6800000000001
not everybody

981.759 --> 985.04
is successful

983.68 --> 987.519
when i attempt to warn them

985.04 --> 989.8389999999999
unfortunately

987.519 --> 991.44
but at least some are especially the

989.839 --> 995.0
younger people that i talk to so i'm

991.44 --> 995.0
happy about that

996.079 --> 1001.12
ah hello tiny wombo welcome to chat

1009.68 --> 1013.92
right yes the

1011.279 --> 1016.0
most of the lockdown situation in the

1013.92 --> 1018.7199999999999
netherlands seems to have been

1016.0 --> 1020.959
halted stopped it's over

1018.72 --> 1023.519
but seriously like the politicians are

1020.959 --> 1026.0
already like warning us like after the

1023.519 --> 1028.319
summer we might have to do it back

1026.0 --> 1029.839
because it'll come back and the

1028.319 --> 1031.9189999999999
creepy

1029.839 --> 1035.4389999999999
delta version

1031.919 --> 1037.199
from india that came to the

1035.439 --> 1038.72
to england now

1037.199 --> 1040.319
all [ __ ]

1038.72 --> 1042.799
but they're really playing on that

1040.319 --> 1042.799
narrative

1050.96 --> 1056.08
but for now it seems like we're all just

1054.72 --> 1058.08
everybody's kind of afraid to do

1056.08 --> 1058.799
whatever they like and they're enjoying

1058.08 --> 1061.4399999999998
it

1058.799 --> 1064.72
and governments and media locally are

1061.44 --> 1066.799
like complaining oh look oh my god look

1064.72 --> 1068.799
at all the junk people have left behind

1066.799 --> 1070.96
it was so clean during the lockdown

1068.799 --> 1072.32
isn't lockdown just better seriously

1070.96 --> 1076.24
they do that [ __ ]

1072.32 --> 1076.24
it's very agitating actually

1077.44 --> 1081.2
and i noticed this even through the

1079.039 --> 1083.52
freaking newspaper that i spread right

1081.2 --> 1086.16
now if the newspaper is going to say oh

1083.52 --> 1087.76
you can get your facts

1086.16 --> 1090.96
or something

1087.76 --> 1093.12
like oh you can get like oh

1090.96 --> 1095.3600000000001
green passport [ __ ] everything that

1093.12 --> 1097.6789999999999
relates to the vex i literally throw

1095.36 --> 1099.36
those papers in the paper bin i don't

1097.679 --> 1101.679
care

1099.36 --> 1103.84
if it's anything but that

1101.679 --> 1106.96
i'll let it through

1103.84 --> 1108.799
i'll i'll spread it

1106.96 --> 1110.96
right and if they don't like that then

1108.799 --> 1114.16
they can fire me i can try to find

1110.96 --> 1116.4
somebody else to do that because yeah

1114.16 --> 1118.72
it's not like they have a lot of workers

1116.4 --> 1121.039
available to them because it doesn't pay

1118.72 --> 1122.96
[ __ ]

1121.039 --> 1126.84
right so they should be happy that i'm

1122.96 --> 1126.8400000000001
doing it at all

1149.039 --> 1154.0
right

1151.52 --> 1154.0
anyway

1156.88 --> 1161.919
anybody see the flat earth debates

1158.559 --> 1162.6399999999999
yesterday i was really informed

1161.919 --> 1165.3600000000001

1170.64 --> 1173.8400000000001
pretty much 20 after

1175.039 --> 1179.72
it was really heavy ball winning

1188.24 --> 1193.84

1190.799 --> 1193.84
i don't know what that is

1194.0 --> 1199.679
with green password i need the covet

1196.72 --> 1199.679
passport [ __ ]

1200.32 --> 1207.0
like they're really trying to push that

1202.64 --> 1207.0
from politics top down

1208.08 --> 1211.8799999999999
i'm not having it

1233.2 --> 1237.039
right so guys

1235.44 --> 1239.2
anybody out there

1237.039 --> 1241.2
or a steamy traveler when you need him

1239.2 --> 1243.52
damn it he always has good questions

1241.2 --> 1248.039
that get me going

1243.52 --> 1248.039
hey nathan r good to see you

1286.72 --> 1289.72
wow

1290.48 --> 1294.08
weird i feel a little dizzy i don't know

1292.159 --> 1297.0390000000002
why

1294.08 --> 1302.0
sick today let me get go

1297.039 --> 1305.0
they make wow no way dude

1302.0 --> 1305.0
why

1306.48 --> 1312.72
hey dutch sailor good to see you

1308.88 --> 1314.72
nathan r why did you freaking take that

1312.72 --> 1316.72
you could literally just tell them like

1314.72 --> 1319.3600000000001
this is

1316.72 --> 1322.4
you can't force me

1319.36 --> 1322.3999999999999
like that's illegal

1330.0 --> 1333.84
nathan r

1331.28 --> 1333.84
please

1334.0 --> 1337.919
justify your action

1336.08 --> 1341.1589999999999
i'm really disappointed to hear that

1337.919 --> 1341.159
from you

1357.52 --> 1360.52
uh

1370.72 --> 1375.84
no nathan r you don't understand it

1373.28 --> 1375.84
seems

1376.559 --> 1382.32
it's illegal to force you to take it and

1379.52 --> 1387.12
if you get fired over it

1382.32 --> 1389.2
that is actually illegal too

1387.12 --> 1391.84
because there has to be a legitimate

1389.2 --> 1392.72
reason for somebody to fire you and if

1391.84 --> 1396.08
it is

1392.72 --> 1398.24
very clear with evidence that they fire

1396.08 --> 1399.84
you because you refuse to take some

1398.24 --> 1401.679
experimental

1399.84 --> 1404.08
garbage

1401.679 --> 1406.24
that's not even been tested

1404.08 --> 1409.039
and that the one telling you to take it

1406.24 --> 1412.08
probably doesn't even know what's in it

1409.039 --> 1413.039
that's illegal you should have told him

1412.08 --> 1415.36
that

1413.039 --> 1417.76
like if you fire me

1415.36 --> 1420.24
you are going to get sued over this and

1417.76 --> 1422.64
not just by you alone by anybody that

1420.24 --> 1425.1200000000001
refuses to take it and gets fired they

1422.64 --> 1427.44
will sue you because it's illegal as

1425.12 --> 1428.84
soon as this [ __ ]

1427.44 --> 1431.44
comes

1428.84 --> 1434.24
through and like

1431.44 --> 1436.96
the whole illegality of the situation

1434.24 --> 1438.64
becomes apparent and nuremberg too kind

1436.96 --> 1440.64
of starts up

1438.64 --> 1442.0800000000002
yeah

1440.64 --> 1444.5590000000002
the employer

1442.08 --> 1446.6399999999999
the one that gave you that job is gonna

1444.559 --> 1449.12
have a problem for having fired you not

1446.64 --> 1449.1200000000001
taking it

1453.919 --> 1459.6000000000001
dude you got steamrolled

1456.159 --> 1462.4
you let him roll ya

1459.6 --> 1463.36
you don't need to know any lawyers to do

1462.4 --> 1465.44
that

1463.36 --> 1467.84
nathan r

1465.44 --> 1470.72
it's not something like oh you're going

1467.84 --> 1473.12
to sue him right away no it's not time

1470.72 --> 1475.3600000000001
yet

1473.12 --> 1479.36
but you should have told him

1475.36 --> 1481.279
like you can't actually do this

1479.36 --> 1484.279
you're gonna be in trouble for doing

1481.279 --> 1484.279
this

1489.12 --> 1493.1999999999998
and it doesn't matter if they twist

1490.96 --> 1495.76
words the thing is you gotta tell them

1493.2 --> 1498.0800000000002
the reality then they can blabber all

1495.76 --> 1500.72
day long about it and be all delusional

1498.08 --> 1502.799
about how they justify doing it

1500.72 --> 1505.52
as long as you told them then they've

1502.799 --> 1508.32
been warned and look if your bosses are

1505.52 --> 1510.48
that freaking insane

1508.32 --> 1513.279
that they'll go with risk of death and

1510.48 --> 1515.2
[ __ ] and be delusional about everything

1513.279 --> 1517.279
you really want to work there under a

1515.2 --> 1518.88
boss like that

1517.279 --> 1520.159
what else will he do

1518.88 --> 1522.5590000000002
make you do

1520.159 --> 1526.3200000000002
you know

1522.559 --> 1526.32
don't take it ever

1526.88 --> 1529.8400000000001
just don't

1554.24 --> 1559.84
right

1555.6 --> 1561.36
yeah and nathan r hey an incentive right

1559.84 --> 1563.36
that's like ooh

1561.36 --> 1565.36
you'll get a bonus

1563.36 --> 1567.1999999999998
you know if you take the shot well

1565.36 --> 1568.7199999999998
that'll be on you then

1567.2 --> 1570.96
thief's gonna say

1568.72 --> 1573.279
no you're fired

1570.96 --> 1575.44
if you don't take it that's not an

1573.279 --> 1578.32
incentive

1575.44 --> 1579.919
that's not an incentive

1578.32 --> 1582.9189999999999
that's more in the direction of

1579.919 --> 1582.919
blackmail

1586.08 --> 1588.3999999999999
right

1591.279 --> 1596.0
i know it's all too late now dude but i

1593.679 --> 1599.64
am really disappointed you did that you

1596.0 --> 1599.64
let them do that

1601.36 --> 1605.52
apply what you have learned don't get

1604.0 --> 1608.0
steamrolled

1605.52 --> 1610.6399999999999
by crazy delusional people that don't

1608.0 --> 1613.2
listen that twist words don't listen to

1610.64 --> 1615.5200000000002
them right are you gonna when a baller

starts to roll out his [ __ ]

1615.52 --> 1619.2
force you to presuppose and get all

1617.36 --> 1622.3999999999999
personal when you don't

1619.2 --> 1625.1200000000001
you're just gonna let give him

1622.4 --> 1626.96
an agreement like okay

1625.12 --> 1629.84
you're not listening to reason so i'm

1626.96 --> 1633.279
just gonna go along with it no no you

1629.84 --> 1635.6789999999999
wouldn't why would you let your boss be

1633.279 --> 1638.32
delusional and make you take that

1635.679 --> 1639.3600000000001
freaking shot

1638.32 --> 1642.9189999999999
right

1639.36 --> 1642.9189999999999
that's on you

1659.6 --> 1665.7199999999998
i need the money

1661.679 --> 1665.72
yeah we all need money

1669.76 --> 1676.559
you know what actually makes money

1673.36 --> 1678.7199999999998
you being fit and healthy

1676.559 --> 1683.48
and being able to do work

1678.72 --> 1683.48
on the long run that's what makes money

1720.399 --> 1724.76
hey james two good morning

1737.84 --> 1742.0
well good sir yeah i don't want to

1740.64 --> 1744.24
make him feel

1742.0 --> 1746.72
really terrible about himself but i am

1744.24 --> 1748.08
i'm going to insist that he understands

1746.72 --> 1752.919
his mistake

1748.08 --> 1752.9189999999999
and stops making excuses for it

1754.72 --> 1759.919
because i don't want anybody else to go

1757.279 --> 1763.039
down that same train of thought like oh

1759.919 --> 1764.0800000000002
but i had to i had money oh no i have to

1763.039 --> 1766.559
no

1764.08 --> 1768.559
no that's blackmail

1766.559 --> 1770.559
it's lit if somebody's gonna take

1768.559 --> 1773.76
something away from you

1770.559 --> 1775.36
under threat you must take this garbage

1773.76 --> 1778.0
experiment

1775.36 --> 1782.399
that's blackmail there's no way in hell

1778.0 --> 1782.399
you should ever consider doing that

1783.2 --> 1787.679
and look there's so many people that are

1785.76 --> 1790.0
being subjected to this especially in

1787.679 --> 1791.8400000000001
the united states

1790.0 --> 1793.76
all go for the money

1791.84 --> 1797.6
it's because you're conditioned to

1793.76 --> 1799.2
conviction to ignore anything just to

1797.6 --> 1802.1589999999999
keep that

1799.2 --> 1803.52
that financial line on the right level

1802.159 --> 1805.919
right

1803.52 --> 1809.039
super dangerous

1805.919 --> 1812.159
and there is lawyers out there

1809.039 --> 1814.48
right you think you're the only one

1812.159 --> 1816.159
no and people do understand and they do

1814.48 --> 1818.48
get a lawyer and there's lawyers

1816.159 --> 1820.72
literally offering themselves to do it

1818.48 --> 1823.279
you don't even have to have money for it

1820.72 --> 1825.44
because they'll get the money afterward

1823.279 --> 1829.52
after the people that have done that

1825.44 --> 1829.52
been sued the [ __ ] out of

1832.96 --> 1837.279
looking for a different job as soon as

1834.799 --> 1839.76
okay well that's something

1837.279 --> 1841.84
okay that's good

1839.76 --> 1844.08
because you wouldn't want to work under

1841.84 --> 1845.84
a boss like that anyway who knows what

1844.08 --> 1848.24
crazy [ __ ] he'll make you do in the

1845.84 --> 1848.24
future

1848.399 --> 1853.12
right

1851.12 --> 1855.12
like what's next he's gonna force you to

1853.12 --> 1856.799
participate in the black lives matter

1855.12 --> 1858.399
rally or something

1856.799 --> 1860.32
you never know

1858.399 --> 1863.279
right if he's gonna make you take a shot

1860.32 --> 1865.6789999999999
then maybe he'll do that too

1863.279 --> 1868.32
something like that antifa rally or

1865.679 --> 1870.5590000000002
something like that garbage

1868.32 --> 1870.559
right

1871.519 --> 1873.919
anyway

1876.48 --> 1881.3600000000001
learning moment for everybody i hope the

1878.799 --> 1882.799
damage to your system will not be too

1881.36 --> 1884.9599999999998
much

1882.799 --> 1886.24
very careful

1884.96 --> 1889.8400000000001
go

1886.24 --> 1891.84
get the detoxing right look up

1889.84 --> 1893.9189999999999
the damage the shot can do what you

1891.84 --> 1897.799
could potentially take

1893.919 --> 1897.7990000000002
to counter the effects

1931.12 --> 1935.039
you need to eat jobs that are not just

1932.88 --> 1937.44
floating around to pick at will or

1935.039 --> 1937.44
really

1937.919 --> 1942.24
so you would rather take a job that

1940.32 --> 1945.4399999999998
would literally

1942.24 --> 1948.64
mean risk of death and long-term disease

1945.44 --> 1950.24
and dementia and all that [ __ ]

1948.64 --> 1953.6000000000001
because

1950.24 --> 1953.6
you might lose your house

1954.24 --> 1956.559
really

1960.96 --> 1965.44
well maybe the entire setup was not

1963.44 --> 1968.0800000000002
viable in the first place ever

1965.44 --> 1969.44
considered that

1968.08 --> 1972.1589999999999
if you

1969.44 --> 1974.24
are forced to be subjected to death

1972.159 --> 1976.64
risks

1974.24 --> 1978.32
then you don't have the things that you

1976.64 --> 1980.0800000000002
risk to lose when you don't you don't

1978.32 --> 1983.559
have them

1980.08 --> 1983.559
you never did

1999.519 --> 2002.519
so

2013.039 --> 2016.12
all right

2026.799 --> 2029.039
like

2029.36 --> 2033.12
i think it's technically better to

2031.12 --> 2036.799
downsize your house

2033.12 --> 2039.9189999999999
move to whatever is shed somewhere

2036.799 --> 2042.559
even if it's with an entire family

2039.919 --> 2045.44
then to freaking take that shot just to

2042.559 --> 2047.6
be able to make your mortgage pay

2045.44 --> 2049.52
because it's all forcing you

2047.6 --> 2052.24
to take that shot i think that's a

2049.52 --> 2052.24
better option

2057.2 --> 2061.839
hello james mason good to see you

2066.72 --> 2071.2799999999997
i've been homeless it's not no of course

2068.56 --> 2071.2799999999997
it's not nice

2071.679 --> 2075.32
i understand that

2080.48 --> 2085.2
but hey if you

2083.04 --> 2086.8
good morale take good care of yourself

2085.2 --> 2090.24
don't get

2086.8 --> 2094.5600000000004
pulled down further into the darkness

2090.24 --> 2098.3199999999997
that is also in that sector homelessness

2094.56 --> 2098.32
then you can get out of it

2098.4 --> 2101.6800000000003
right

2099.359 --> 2102.64
if you take that shot what it's gonna do

2101.68 --> 2106.0
to you

2102.64 --> 2107.68
you'll not be able to get out of that

2106.0 --> 2112.839
all right

2107.68 --> 2112.839
and the influences can be cascading

2113.2 --> 2120.24
literally can literally even rub off

2117.04 --> 2120.24
on your close family

2121.599 --> 2126.1600000000003
detox products yeah but detox products

2124.48 --> 2129.119
yes

2126.16 --> 2130.48
it'll do some good for you

2129.119 --> 2132.48
but unfortunately

2130.48 --> 2133.599
the vax

2132.48 --> 2137.44
is

2133.599 --> 2139.52
has yeah genetic alteration [ __ ] in it

2137.44 --> 2141.76
it makes your body go and produce

2139.52 --> 2143.599
certain proteins that are incredibly bad

2141.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
for you

2143.599 --> 2147.599
and supplements is not going to take

2145.839 --> 2148.56
that away

2147.599 --> 2150.96
right

2148.56 --> 2153.2799999999997
you got to realize that this is not just

2150.96 --> 2155.76
like oh take some

2153.28 --> 2158.5600000000004
amount of cyanide that's almost deadly

2155.76 --> 2160.32
right that's bad for you but when you

2158.56 --> 2162.88
get out of it

2160.32 --> 2165.599
your body can recover maybe have some

2162.88 --> 2168.88
damage recover it'll still be your body

2165.599 --> 2171.119
right well this shot is not like that

2168.88 --> 2172.8
poison now this actually permanently

2171.119 --> 2175.04
alter stuff

2172.8 --> 2177.8390000000004
on a cellular level not necessarily

2175.04 --> 2181.2
everywhere but locally where the shot is

2177.839 --> 2184.2
put in yes definitely

2181.2 --> 2184.2
right

2191.2 --> 2193.359
oh

2192.24 --> 2196.24
pet fee

2193.359 --> 2198.72
parasite and social welfare well

2196.24 --> 2200.9599999999996
you you think that it's better

2198.72 --> 2204.0
to take a [ __ ] shot that'll

2200.96 --> 2206.88
genetically alter you and guarantee

2204.0 --> 2210.0
long-term dementia

2206.88 --> 2213.839
and all kinds of health problems

2210.0 --> 2216.56
and then still have that job

2213.839 --> 2218.56
you you think that's better than just

2216.56 --> 2220.56
avoiding it and then having to live on

2218.56 --> 2222.16
social welfare which is not the best of

2220.56 --> 2224.4
situations

2222.16 --> 2227.5989999999997
i don't think so i think that's really

2224.4 --> 2227.839
sick thing to say pat

2227.599 --> 2231.2000000000003
it's fee

2227.839 --> 2231.2
really sick thing to say

2232.24 --> 2236.7999999999997
yeah if you have to go on social welfare

2234.24 --> 2238.3999999999996
to avoid being part

2236.8 --> 2242.0
of an

2238.4 --> 2246.04
medical experiment

2242.0 --> 2246.04
then that's not a vice

2257.2 --> 2262.3199999999997
it alters every cell okay i don't know

2260.24 --> 2263.9199999999996
about that tom parker

2262.32 --> 2266.32
could be

2263.92 --> 2268.48
i just know that at least it will alter

2266.32 --> 2270.8
it locally and maybe further it depends

2268.48 --> 2273.359
on how much of the

2270.8 --> 2274.88
the effects the combined shots because

2273.359 --> 2277.92
it's combined

2274.88 --> 2280.92
how much it hits

2277.92 --> 2280.92
right

2285.44 --> 2289.359
oh well pat fee

2287.599 --> 2293.04
in that case

2289.359 --> 2295.2
get the [ __ ] out piece of [ __ ] done with

2293.04 --> 2295.2
you

2296.88 --> 2301.839
[ __ ] you take the shot and die [ __ ]

2300.0 --> 2305.119
get the [ __ ] out i don't ever want to

2301.839 --> 2307.04
see your ugly freaking

2305.119 --> 2308.4
chat text

2307.04 --> 2311.4
in here again

2308.4 --> 2311.4
scum

2314.63 --> 2317.679
[Music]

2323.28 --> 2328.5600000000004
[Music]

2326.4 --> 2331.52
i've been talking about this for over a

2328.56 --> 2333.2799999999997
[ __ ] year you [ __ ]

2331.52 --> 2336.16
you dare

2333.28 --> 2338.2400000000002
put that [ __ ] in here in my chat piece

2336.16 --> 2341.24
of [ __ ] i don't ever want to see you

2338.24 --> 2341.24
again

2350.0 --> 2354.079
yeah

2351.2 --> 2356.96
now what did they say i'll tell you he

2354.079 --> 2359.3590000000004
said i haven't seen any data suggestions

2356.96 --> 2361.76
all your claims in regards to the side

2359.359 --> 2363.2799999999997
effect of the covet shot right so he

2361.76 --> 2366.4
says no

2363.28 --> 2367.92
there is no side effect he doesn't even

2366.4 --> 2370.0
know what it is even though i've been

2367.92 --> 2373.119
telling him constantly

2370.0 --> 2376.16
yeah based on freaking pubmed data

2373.119 --> 2380.0
endless cross-references thousands of

2376.16 --> 2382.56
doctors literally laying it out every

2380.0 --> 2385.839
little piece of it and i reflect that

2382.56 --> 2388.16
and i have for the last year

2385.839 --> 2391.599
yeah no evidence

2388.16 --> 2394.839
take the [ __ ] shot and die [ __ ]

2391.599 --> 2394.839
do it

2398.88 --> 2405.67
right and that that's specifically to

2401.359 --> 2408.719
pat fee that's not to you nathan r

2405.67 --> 2408.719
[Music]

2422.16 --> 2429.44
yeah i know dutch sailor dude

2425.599 --> 2433.3590000000004
alternative media is literally just

2429.44 --> 2436.48
endless hours and hours and hours of

2433.359 --> 2439.52
combined footage of people

2436.48 --> 2442.16
what they got even like as they pass out

2439.52 --> 2445.119
in [ __ ] after taking it and then having

2442.16 --> 2448.96
to be hospitalized yeah

2445.119 --> 2451.119
thousands of hours by now combined

2448.96 --> 2452.96
at least hundreds maybe thousands it's

2451.119 --> 2454.56
just so many different videos i can't

2452.96 --> 2457.28
even keep track of it anymore at first

2454.56 --> 2459.52
people were like databasing it because

2457.28 --> 2460.7200000000003
it's going to be deleted it's every

2459.52 --> 2465.24
[ __ ] day

2460.72 --> 2465.24
every day something like that happens

2473.04 --> 2478.24
how did you not get into trouble for it

2475.68 --> 2481.1189999999997
well you're just lucky then

2478.24 --> 2483.52
you don't have a short-term side effect

2481.119 --> 2485.44
but you will have the long-term side

2483.52 --> 2488.16
effect tiny womble

2485.44 --> 2492.0
everybody that's taken the shot

2488.16 --> 2494.64
no exception will have the long-term

2492.0 --> 2497.04
side effects you will have to spike

2494.64 --> 2499.2799999999997
protein buildup in your body and the

2497.04 --> 2501.44
consequences that come with it there is

2499.28 --> 2503.92
no avoiding this

2501.44 --> 2505.76
right you might survive the first shot

2503.92 --> 2507.44
you might not get a heart attack and die

2505.76 --> 2508.96
or something like that

2507.44 --> 2512.319
but you will

2508.96 --> 2515.359
get the spike protein growth

2512.319 --> 2517.2
you cannot avoid it once you've taken

2515.359 --> 2519.44
the shot

2517.2 --> 2522.319
specifically the second shot i think

2519.44 --> 2524.56
maybe the first one i don't exactly know

2522.319 --> 2526.8
dude it's so complicated what it

2524.56 --> 2529.359
actually literally all contains and how

2526.8 --> 2534.04
it works

2529.359 --> 2534.04
genetic engineering is weird as [ __ ]

2543.119 --> 2548.2000000000003
don't know anybody who did well i do pam

2545.2 --> 2548.2
cowell

2553.52 --> 2559.04
what is the long-term side effect the

2555.92 --> 2563.64
long-term side effect is alzheimer

2559.04 --> 2563.64
among one are one effect

2564.4 --> 2567.76
also

2565.68 --> 2569.68
if you're a woman you'll never be able

2567.76 --> 2573.28
to have kids again

2569.68 --> 2574.96
because it's going to interrupt

2573.28 --> 2576.88
your

2574.96 --> 2578.48
yeah certain cycles

2576.88 --> 2579.6800000000003
in the womb

2578.48 --> 2582.96
during

2579.68 --> 2584.56
during the growth in in the

2582.96 --> 2587.28
early stages

2584.56 --> 2590.319
so every woman that's taking it will be

2587.28 --> 2592.6400000000003
extremely likely to get

2590.319 --> 2594.4
what they call miscarriages every single

2592.64 --> 2596.0789999999997
time from then on

2594.4 --> 2598.2400000000002
men might get

2596.079 --> 2601.6800000000003
their balls might simply get attacked

2598.24 --> 2606.359
too like yeah spike protein is crap

2601.68 --> 2606.359
it does all kinds of terrible things

2608.88 --> 2613.119
how do we know the long-term side effect

2610.88 --> 2615.839
because this is what it does it's

2613.119 --> 2617.839
literally said it produces spike protein

2615.839 --> 2620.7999999999997
that's what it does that's what's

2617.839 --> 2625.359
altered that's the experiment

2620.8 --> 2627.52
insert spike protein producing stuff

2625.359 --> 2629.119
make your body produce spike protein

2627.52 --> 2630.72
that's the

2629.119 --> 2631.599
experiment

2630.72 --> 2635.2799999999997
right

2631.599 --> 2637.2000000000003
you can't avoid it that is the long-term

2635.28 --> 2640.8390000000004
side effect you will have that and it's

2637.2 --> 2640.839
not gonna go away

2659.2 --> 2663.5989999999997
so is the problem here with the mrna

2661.359 --> 2665.359
vaccine it's not a vaccine because

2663.599 --> 2669.04
vaccination is

2665.359 --> 2672.24
specifically based in original science

2669.04 --> 2675.2799999999997
right this is not a vaccine this is just

2672.24 --> 2678.64
a genetic experiment

2675.28 --> 2682.5600000000004
it's nothing to do with vaccination

2678.64 --> 2686.0789999999997
like it's physically impossible

2682.56 --> 2690.0
to influence positive or negative the

2686.079 --> 2693.2000000000003
covet condition or anything related

2690.0 --> 2696.4
it doesn't actually do anything

2693.2 --> 2699.359
to that like there's no even virtual

2696.4 --> 2702.64
system in which it will influence it it

2699.359 --> 2705.839
has nothing to do with it at all nothing

2702.64 --> 2705.839
nothing nothing

2711.119 --> 2716.96
and i've always said yeah vaccination

2714.079 --> 2718.96
original idea of vaccination right louis

2716.96 --> 2720.7200000000003
pasteur

2718.96 --> 2724.56
germ theory yeah

2720.72 --> 2724.56
it works it does work

2725.04 --> 2730.16
but that's not what this is it has

2726.88 --> 2732.96
nothing to do with it anymore

2730.16 --> 2735.839
you can take a vaccine against

2732.96 --> 2738.319
certain types of diseases

2735.839 --> 2740.24
and you will literally get antibodies

2738.319 --> 2743.92
this freaking shot

2740.24 --> 2746.64
doesn't even have anything to do

2743.92 --> 2749.359
with the immune system

2746.64 --> 2751.04
it doesn't give you antibodies for

2749.359 --> 2754.7999999999997
anything

2751.04 --> 2760.0
it doesn't do anything

2754.8 --> 2762.6400000000003
to that it's only an experiment to alter

2760.0 --> 2766.72
your genetic setup

2762.64 --> 2768.72
to make you create spike proteins that's

2766.72 --> 2772.56
it

2768.72 --> 2775.1189999999997
no antibodies involved

2772.56 --> 2778.119
yeah so it has nothing to do with

2775.119 --> 2778.119
vaccinations

2801.68 --> 2806.16
change to what's your take on zombie

2803.76 --> 2808.2400000000002
preparedness i don't know i don't read

2806.16 --> 2809.68
the cdc website

2808.24 --> 2812.24
it's not for my country i don't even

2809.68 --> 2817.0789999999997
read the freaking websites

2812.24 --> 2817.0789999999997
the organizations here that do that

2818.319 --> 2822.56
organization involved here with it i've

2820.319 --> 2825.119
already just declared them your criminal

2822.56 --> 2828.4
organization and i tell everybody like

2825.119 --> 2831.28
oh this group says to do this then never

2828.4 --> 2834.88
do it they are a criminal organization

2831.28 --> 2838.2400000000002
and they will be arrested eventually and

2834.88 --> 2839.28
tried for war crimes under the nuremberg

2838.24 --> 2844.68
code

2839.28 --> 2844.6800000000003
don't do anything they say

2851.599 --> 2856.839
can isolate covet so there's no

2853.839 --> 2859.52
traditional coveted vaccine well

2856.839 --> 2862.4
because covet is not an infectious

2859.52 --> 2864.079
disease it's a condition it's a bodily

2862.4 --> 2866.559
condition

2864.079 --> 2869.44
has to do with cleaning up your system

2866.559 --> 2873.2000000000003
on a cellular level

2869.44 --> 2874.559
it's not a viral infection it's not

2873.2 --> 2878.24
something

2874.559 --> 2880.88
or a particle unbeknown to you enters

2878.24 --> 2885.1189999999997
your body and then starts to spread

2880.88 --> 2887.76
making you sick that's not how it works

2885.119 --> 2889.28
it's a condition it's not an infectious

2887.76 --> 2891.5200000000004
disease

2889.28 --> 2894.6400000000003
it's not how it works

2891.52 --> 2897.28
right an infection requires an organism

2894.64 --> 2899.7599999999998
that's self-replicating from the outside

2897.28 --> 2904.559
to enter your body

2899.76 --> 2906.559
and then replicate itself right viruses

2904.559 --> 2908.8
effectively don't even exist in that

2906.559 --> 2911.92
model they don't

2908.8 --> 2914.319
everybody has these viral particles in

2911.92 --> 2916.96
them it's called exosomes it's part of

2914.319 --> 2918.88
the body's mechanisms it's not alive it

2916.96 --> 2920.319
can't replicate

2918.88 --> 2921.92
it won't

2920.319 --> 2924.96
replicate

2921.92 --> 2928.16
it only will do that in your body

2924.96 --> 2930.7200000000003
basically ordered by the body

2928.16 --> 2931.92
because there's a lot of junk

2930.72 --> 2934.16
around

2931.92 --> 2936.48
and the exosomes clean it up and then

2934.16 --> 2940.16
they need to repro they need there need

2936.48 --> 2943.599
to be more of them when it's bad

2940.16 --> 2944.96
so it starts to go after cells

2943.599 --> 2946.96
that

2944.96 --> 2948.0
basically can't handle the poison and

2946.96 --> 2949.92
then they're going to use them to

2948.0 --> 2952.16
replicate more of it basically bring out

2949.92 --> 2954.48
more tools and clean it up that's what

2952.16 --> 2957.7599999999998
happens that's what they do it's body

2954.48 --> 2962.88
inherent everybody has exosomes in their

2957.76 --> 2964.6400000000003
body since birth at all time all the

2962.88 --> 2967.28
time always

2964.64 --> 2971.839
right because it's not something that

2967.28 --> 2971.8390000000004
infects you from the outside

2984.48 --> 2990.559
baltard is messaging me again

2988.079 --> 2994.079
he must be uh

2990.559 --> 2996.48
financially invested in the uh corona

2994.079 --> 2999.6400000000003
death scam so he doesn't like it when i

2996.48 --> 2999.64
do this

3032.64 --> 3035.7999999999997
all right

3053.44 --> 3057.359
yeah tiny one well that's right it is a

3055.76 --> 3058.1600000000003
test it's a

3057.359 --> 3061.92
test

3058.16 --> 3065.92
if you're worthy enough to survive

3061.92 --> 3065.92
worthy enough to continue on

3067.2 --> 3072.319
in the form of population control

3069.76 --> 3074.559
yeah that's right that's what it is

3072.319 --> 3076.64
tiny wumbo

3074.559 --> 3078.96
and i know where you're at

3076.64 --> 3082.0
i know you failed and i know you will

3078.96 --> 3082.8
continue to fail i know if some piece of

3082.0 --> 3085.44
[ __ ]

3082.8 --> 3087.44
family member your boss anything some

3085.44 --> 3089.52
colleague you really like

3087.44 --> 3090.96
is going to tell you to take another one

3089.52 --> 3092.8
you'll do it

3090.96 --> 3095.2
because you failed

3092.8 --> 3099.04
tiny wumbo you failed

3095.2 --> 3099.04
yeah and you're still defending it

3099.92 --> 3103.88
you failed the test

3115.55 --> 3118.6890000000003
[Music]

3152.16 --> 3156.319
no dutch sailor

3154.4 --> 3157.92
you yeah i don't blame you if you're

3156.319 --> 3160.319
gonna ignore him but he literally

3157.92 --> 3162.2400000000002
announced

3160.319 --> 3163.359
beginning of this year how he was gonna

3162.24 --> 3165.1189999999997
take it

3163.359 --> 3167.92
and he took it

3165.119 --> 3169.52
i don't know about the passport [ __ ]

3167.92 --> 3171.359
right that does if he doesn't have a

3169.52 --> 3176.599
passport doesn't make him a liar but he

3171.359 --> 3176.5989999999997
did take it and in it he failed

3195.04 --> 3199.2799999999997
you want evidence

3197.04 --> 3201.04
for the claim tiny womble

3199.28 --> 3203.2000000000003
why don't you go to a doctor have a

3201.04 --> 3205.599
blood sample and ask him to test it on

3203.2 --> 3207.2799999999997
spike proteins yeah

3205.599 --> 3209.839
why don't you do that let's see what

3207.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
comes out

3214.48 --> 3217.48
hmm

3221.82 --> 3224.8790000000004
[Music]

3261.119 --> 3265.839
at least he must have a document that

3262.72 --> 3268.0
states he has it does he touch sailor i

3265.839 --> 3270.64
don't know about that

3268.0 --> 3273.04
but i do know that if he really did take

3270.64 --> 3276.5589999999997
it then the doctor or whatever that gave

3273.04 --> 3279.359
him will have a registration of that

3276.559 --> 3281.3590000000004
so he is registered and he could

3279.359 --> 3284.48
that could eventually be turned into a

3281.359 --> 3284.48
passport or whatever

3286.48 --> 3290.4
not in the uk

3288.0 --> 3290.4
really

3291.2 --> 3297.2799999999997
no registration of that

3293.44 --> 3297.28
that's completely irresponsible

3297.839 --> 3299.599
that's

3298.64 --> 3303.44
that's

3299.599 --> 3303.44
totally irresponsible

3304.16 --> 3310.799
it's experimental everybody that's

3307.04 --> 3312.799
taking it must have a registration of it

3310.799 --> 3316.319
you can't just

3312.799 --> 3320.079
randomly eject experiment stuff into

3316.319 --> 3324.44
people and not even say you did that

3320.079 --> 3324.44
makes it even worse

3343.76 --> 3349.0
right he does have a card there you go

3351.05 --> 3354.4390000000003
[Music]

3360.16 --> 3364.72
are there reputables sources saying

3362.64 --> 3367.2799999999997
spike proteins are dangerous

3364.72 --> 3369.1189999999997
uh why don't you just look in medical

3367.28 --> 3370.559
literature

3369.119 --> 3375.4
to see

3370.559 --> 3375.4
about spike proteins what that does

3376.0 --> 3381.68
right there's no studies

3379.2 --> 3382.48
of it that say that there's that it's

3381.68 --> 3385.04
like

3382.48 --> 3388.0
it's it's a hazardous thing

3385.04 --> 3388.0
always has been

3388.24 --> 3394.0789999999997
spiked proteins existed

3390.799 --> 3394.079
before the shot too

3396.559 --> 3400.96
why are people consenting to this

3398.319 --> 3403.68
because they would rather die

3400.96 --> 3405.92
than to admit that the entire system is

3403.68 --> 3408.24
totally [ __ ] them over

3405.92 --> 3410.079
they would rather die than to let that

3408.24 --> 3412.72
realization sink in good serve and

3410.079 --> 3414.4
that's why

3412.72 --> 3417.839
they don't want to deal with it they'd

3414.4 --> 3420.48
rather take a russian roulette shot

3417.839 --> 3421.599
than to deal with the [ __ ] reality of

3420.48 --> 3423.92
the world

3421.599 --> 3428.04
that has arrived on underneath their

3423.92 --> 3428.04
feet that's why

3439.119 --> 3444.52
hello nathan oakley 1980 by the way good

3441.28 --> 3444.52
to see you

3449.76 --> 3455.44
i bet the orion strains no dusty ryder

3452.799 --> 3458.16
there are no ferian strains there are no

3455.44 --> 3461.52
strains covid is not an infectious

3458.16 --> 3464.319
disease there is no strength

3461.52 --> 3465.92
it isn't it there's nothing it's nothing

3464.319 --> 3468.4
it's 100

3465.92 --> 3471.76
make-believe delusion to keep the

3468.4 --> 3475.839
bureaucracy crap going there is no for

3471.76 --> 3475.8390000000004
ryan it doesn't exist

3475.92 --> 3479.319
it's a condition

3536.0 --> 3539.28
okay

3537.04 --> 3540.799
pam cow you're reading that

3539.28 --> 3543.28
well

3540.799 --> 3545.119
that's one angle to it

3543.28 --> 3548.799
right but when your body starts to

3545.119 --> 3551.44
produce these spike proteins

3548.799 --> 3553.599
and naturally

3551.44 --> 3558.68
then it is a problem because there are

3553.599 --> 3558.6800000000003
long-term problems when it builds up

3562.88 --> 3567.599
one of the problems is alzheimer

3565.599 --> 3569.76
it's a classic

3567.599 --> 3571.599
it's one of the most direct associations

3569.76 --> 3574.2400000000002
there is a problem with it i don't know

3571.599 --> 3576.4
what you're reading right now but

3574.24 --> 3579.5989999999997
is that from dutch sailors

3576.4 --> 3579.599
thing let me take a look

3581.359 --> 3584.359
now

3587.04 --> 3590.16
has nothing to do with it

3596.16 --> 3601.48
hey stella in 80 12. yeah i'm doing

3598.48 --> 3601.48
great

3614.079 --> 3617.079
uh

3641.2 --> 3645.5989999999997
all right so yeah palm cow the entire

3643.44 --> 3649.04
thing you just said is already

3645.599 --> 3650.799
presupposing something it's very bad so

3649.04 --> 3652.72
what what is it that you're actually

3650.799 --> 3654.72
saying right now you said so spike

3652.72 --> 3657.2
proteins are simply the mechanism by

3654.72 --> 3660.0
which an infection

3657.2 --> 3661.5989999999997
oh really infection lycovid can enter

3660.0 --> 3663.2
cells but they're not inherently

3661.599 --> 3664.7200000000003
dangerous by themselves i don't know

3663.2 --> 3666.5589999999997
even where you're getting that because

3664.72 --> 3668.16
they are

3666.559 --> 3670.1600000000003
maybe in lower amounts they're not that

3668.16 --> 3671.68
dangerous but they when they continually

3670.16 --> 3673.359
are produced in the body and keep

3671.68 --> 3677.1189999999997
building up yeah they do become

3673.359 --> 3677.119
dangerous absolutely they do

3678.4 --> 3683.839
right

3680.48 --> 3687.119
but yeah it's already presupposing

3683.839 --> 3689.599
an infection enterings oh you mean the

3687.119 --> 3692.319
inherent bodily mechanism

3689.599 --> 3694.4
of exosomes trying to clean your body up

3692.319 --> 3696.48
so they're going to go into the cells

3694.4 --> 3699.119
and re basically have more of them

3696.48 --> 3701.52
produced to clean it up locally

3699.119 --> 3704.319
so you're literally the spike proteins

3701.52 --> 3706.4
are going to meddle with your body's

3704.319 --> 3708.88
inherent mechanism

3706.4 --> 3711.76
to clean up your cells that's what it's

3708.88 --> 3714.0
doing it's literally met meddling

3711.76 --> 3716.6400000000003
in your inner

3714.0 --> 3716.64
systems

3716.799 --> 3721.359
that sounds extremely bad

3720.0 --> 3723.359
i would never

3721.359 --> 3727.2799999999997
let anything do that

3723.359 --> 3729.119
to me i would never do that right it's

3727.28 --> 3732.799
ridiculous it says it's a little coffee

3729.119 --> 3734.88
infection it's not a freaking infection

3732.799 --> 3738.28
it isn't

3734.88 --> 3738.28
no proof

3751.039 --> 3755.6400000000003
nicole sources oh yeah i'm sure

3776.319 --> 3781.64
pamko i really don't know what sources

3778.4 --> 3781.64
you're reading

3784.64 --> 3791.48
but yeah the sources seem to be based on

3787.599 --> 3791.48
erroneous presuppositions

3821.359 --> 3824.359
at

3826.319 --> 3832.079
no don't do that sid that's it don't

3829.039 --> 3834.4
don't do that let freaking tiny wombo be

3832.079 --> 3837.6800000000003
tiny wombo he wants to hang on to the

3834.4 --> 3839.44
ball no matter what that's fine

3837.68 --> 3841.839
let him have his ball

3839.44 --> 3844.7200000000003
he doesn't want to know that the world

3841.839 --> 3848.0389999999998
is actually committing medical fraud and

3844.72 --> 3849.68
using people as guinea pigs

3848.039 --> 3852.2400000000002
simultaneously

3849.68 --> 3854.0789999999997
rolling out a eugenics population

3852.24 --> 3855.9199999999996
control operation he doesn't want to

3854.079 --> 3857.28
know that well that's his [ __ ]

3855.92 --> 3858.88
problem

3857.28 --> 3862.0
right don't

3858.88 --> 3864.48
don't go threaten him

3862.0 --> 3864.48
anything

3865.119 --> 3868.96
let him have what he wants

3876.72 --> 3882.799
yeah still in 80 12 that's really stupid

3879.92 --> 3882.799
really stupid

3884.079 --> 3888.319
and uh yeah you know how many people

3886.48 --> 3891.359
that actually taken the shots

3888.319 --> 3892.5589999999997
immediately got covet condition right

3891.359 --> 3895.0389999999998
after

3892.559 --> 3897.3590000000004
a whole bunch

3895.039 --> 3899.44
right you know why that is by the way

3897.359 --> 3901.839
it's not because they got infected it's

3899.44 --> 3904.96
because they literally injected poison

3901.839 --> 3906.799
in their body that attacks

3904.96 --> 3909.28
you know them their body in a very

3906.799 --> 3910.88
unusual way and it's not unlikely that

3909.28 --> 3914.88
your body will be like hey there's

3910.88 --> 3916.6400000000003
poisonous [ __ ] out here quickly

3914.88 --> 3919.52
get sick

3916.64 --> 3922.0
so we can purge this garbage right and

3919.52 --> 3924.4
then you get it you get the covet you

3922.0 --> 3925.839
get that sort of condition

3924.4 --> 3927.6800000000003
because it's not like you're being

3925.839 --> 3929.839
infected no you're just being poisoned

3927.68 --> 3932.16
so the coven condition is then summoned

3929.839 --> 3936.52
from within in order to try and clean it

3932.16 --> 3936.52
up that's what actually happens

3937.039 --> 3941.96
a lot of people that taken this shot

3955.359 --> 3960.5989999999997
that sailor leave him alone i mean it

3970.4 --> 3974.2400000000002
all right if you really can't handle

3971.839 --> 3976.48
tiny womble then just ban him and i

3974.24 --> 3979.0389999999998
don't mean ban him from my chat but like

3976.48 --> 3981.28
block him so you don't see him anymore

3979.039 --> 3985.119
here we go again as already does that to

3981.28 --> 3988.0
a lot of people that you can't handle

3985.119 --> 3989.76
because if she finds them too repulsive

3988.0 --> 3991.92
so if you really can't deal with tiny

3989.76 --> 3993.92
bumble then i suggest you do that too

3991.92 --> 3995.119
but

3993.92 --> 3997.359
don't

3995.119 --> 4000.839
don't go for personal [ __ ] it's not

3997.359 --> 4000.839
worth it dude

4014.72 --> 4019.2799999999997
ah well there you go gary wubanga thanks

4017.28 --> 4021.28
for the example

4019.28 --> 4023.92
thank you for that right

4021.28 --> 4026.0
i rely on that because every time i

4023.92 --> 4029.92
bring something up it's not like this

4026.0 --> 4032.4
niche unique thing that happened no

4029.92 --> 4034.96
i started referencing things in relation

4032.4 --> 4037.359
to the situation when i know it's

4034.96 --> 4041.2
happening out there at plenty and look

4037.359 --> 4043.52
guess what gary benga just

4041.2 --> 4045.839
has a literal

4043.52 --> 4048.079
personal in life example

4045.839 --> 4050.799
for what i just said right that's what

4048.079 --> 4052.559
i'm counting on

4050.799 --> 4055.2
so i appreciate that

4052.559 --> 4058.599
for bringing us that example thank you

4055.2 --> 4058.5989999999997
gary wiebenga

4063.25 --> 4066.16
[Music]

4064.64 --> 4068.4
all right dutch sailor if you want to

4066.16 --> 4069.92
really block tiny bumble

4068.4 --> 4071.359
although you said you would mind block

4069.92 --> 4073.2000000000003
him in

4071.359 --> 4074.96
right i could

4073.2 --> 4076.96
basically take your wrench for a moment

4074.96 --> 4078.88
so you can just block him

4076.96 --> 4080.0
and then give it back if that's what you

4078.88 --> 4083.7200000000003
want

4080.0 --> 4083.72
just give me the word

4112.319 --> 4117.04
yeah well tiny wumble yeah you've always

4114.4 --> 4119.199
been civil but you do get this crap back

4117.04 --> 4120.719
not because you've been civil but

4119.199 --> 4124.4
because

4120.719 --> 4126.719
you're obviously making very bad choices

4124.4 --> 4129.599999999999
and like being

4126.719 --> 4133.839
unreachable about it that pisses people

4129.6 --> 4133.839
off it pisses me off okay

4134.319 --> 4138.319
except that i managed to

4135.88 --> 4141.839
compartmentalize it and simply put you

4138.319 --> 4141.839000000001
on a lower staircase

4142.319 --> 4149.92
as an individual

4145.279 --> 4152.400000000001
your x x percentage deluded right i do

4149.92 --> 4154.08
that with everybody do that with ballers

4152.4 --> 4156.799
do that with flat earthers i do them

4154.08 --> 4160.4
with everybody yeah you went a couple of

4156.799 --> 4161.679
steps down but you already did that

4160.4 --> 4163.92
a year ago

4161.679 --> 4166.08
when you first announced that you

4163.92 --> 4168.2390000000005
insisted

4166.08 --> 4170.5599999999995
and repentingly you were gonna take that

4168.239 --> 4172.5599999999995
freaking shot

4170.56 --> 4174.4800000000005
as we were all trying to inform you

4172.56 --> 4176.96
about it and you still did it yeah that

4174.48 --> 4179.759
really took away

4176.96 --> 4181.04
a whole chunk of respect for me for you

4179.759 --> 4183.44
permanently

4181.04 --> 4185.2789999999995
and you may still be civil but that

4183.44 --> 4186.839
respect ain't coming back with your

4185.279 --> 4188.799000000001
civility

4186.839 --> 4191.839
okay

4188.799 --> 4195.199
in ways you are a complete idiot

4191.839 --> 4195.199
and that's never going to change

4196.96 --> 4202.56
unless you change but you don't seem to

4199.44 --> 4206.08
be able to or willing to

4202.56 --> 4206.080000000001
so yeah you have that

4206.32 --> 4210.12
that's the way it's gonna be

4220.159 --> 4225.199
yeah i know you do tiny wumbo i know you

4222.48 --> 4227.678999999999
do and that's the problem

4225.199 --> 4230.96
that's your problem dude

4227.679 --> 4234.56
and it is your problem

4230.96 --> 4236.64
it really is it's your problem

4234.56 --> 4238.159000000001
you're the one actually doing this [ __ ]

4236.64 --> 4240.64
to yourself

4238.159 --> 4243.839999999999
and you're okay with it yeah that's

4240.64 --> 4246.84
literally your

4243.84 --> 4246.84
okay

4259.36 --> 4262.36
uh

4274.4 --> 4277.4
so

4286.4 --> 4289.28
all right

4287.199 --> 4291.28
so is this going to be the subject for

4289.28 --> 4295.12
today just this

4291.28 --> 4297.44
it's not really making me much happier

4295.12 --> 4298.719
so this confrontation with people that

4297.44 --> 4300.639999999999
are just

4298.719 --> 4303.04
cultists and they don't even know it and

4300.64 --> 4304.4800000000005
they will never admit it

4303.04 --> 4306.48
they'll never admit it even on their

4304.48 --> 4308.959999999999
deathbed probably

4306.48 --> 4311.199
but by that time who gives a [ __ ] you

4308.96 --> 4315.76
know

4311.199 --> 4317.12
by that time nobody will care about you

4315.76 --> 4319.92
at all

4317.12 --> 4323.44
and they will not pity you for being a

4319.92 --> 4326.64
victim to a medical experiment either

4323.44 --> 4328.48
because we warned you about it and you

4326.64 --> 4330.88
did it anyway

4328.48 --> 4330.879999999999
yeah

4331.44 --> 4334.96
again it's your problem

4338.0 --> 4342.64
do i know anybody that has caught covet

4340.96 --> 4344.8
nope

4342.64 --> 4346.159000000001
but probably a whole bunch of people did

4344.8 --> 4348.719
and then they

4346.159 --> 4351.92
either didn't even get symptoms

4348.719 --> 4353.04
or they had some symptoms just went away

4351.92 --> 4356.76
because

4353.04 --> 4356.76
it's a condition

4358.8 --> 4363.360000000001
i've probably had it maybe even multiple

4361.04 --> 4365.199
times

4363.36 --> 4368.48
i don't care

4365.199 --> 4371.36
it's not an infection

4368.48 --> 4373.44
i don't get it when other people get it

4371.36 --> 4375.04
and other people don't get it when i get

4373.44 --> 4377.12
it

4375.04 --> 4380.12
it's a condition it's not an infectious

4377.12 --> 4380.12
disease

4394.239 --> 4398.718999999999
coronavirus common cold no that's not

4396.48 --> 4400.0
actually the common cold

4398.719 --> 4402.32
it's another

4400.0 --> 4403.199
look there are many different conditions

4402.32 --> 4405.759999999999
right

4403.199 --> 4407.36
common cold is sneezing

4405.76 --> 4408.320000000001
sinuses

4407.36 --> 4409.839999999999
that

4408.32 --> 4412.4
region

4409.84 --> 4414.08
it's not the same element

4412.4 --> 4417.12
and then the covet condition is

4414.08 --> 4418.48
specifically throat and lungs

4417.12 --> 4419.599999999999
there's different

4418.48 --> 4420.959999999999
you have

4419.6 --> 4423.120000000001
bowel

4420.96 --> 4424.719
they call it like the bowel flu

4423.12 --> 4426.96
think that's the same thing no that's

4424.719 --> 4430.2390000000005
again another condition because there's

4426.96 --> 4432.88
all these different local conditions

4430.239 --> 4435.36
and none of them are infectious

4432.88 --> 4437.12
they all just respond to being poisoned

4435.36 --> 4438.239
so

4437.12 --> 4440.4
yeah

4438.239 --> 4442.48
eat something really bad

4440.4 --> 4445.12
for your intestines well you might get

4442.48 --> 4447.759999999999
the bowel flu as they would call it get

4445.12 --> 4450.08
the [ __ ] or whatever right

4447.76 --> 4452.56
call that they call it a bowel infection

4450.08 --> 4455.04
is it though are you literally infected

4452.56 --> 4456.159000000001
or were you just poison

4455.04 --> 4457.12
and then

4456.159 --> 4458.719
yeah

4457.12 --> 4461.28
side effects

4458.719 --> 4464.4
has to be cleaned up internally in that

4461.28 --> 4464.4
region right this

4464.64 --> 4469.1990000000005
covid is a very specific condition

4467.199 --> 4470.639999999999
that's they even say that or they call

4469.199 --> 4473.5199999999995
it the disease

4470.64 --> 4475.52
infectious disease and but it's specific

4473.52 --> 4477.84
to a certain

4475.52 --> 4479.84
to your airways that's

4477.84 --> 4482.32
the specificity

4479.84 --> 4485.360000000001
of the covet condition common cold is

4482.32 --> 4488.4
not that common cold is another type of

4485.36 --> 4492.12
condition is very similar as a different

4488.4 --> 4492.12
region in the body

4496.96 --> 4503.04
let's tell in 80 12 people get it all

4500.4 --> 4507.199
the time throughout their lives

4503.04 --> 4510.0
everybody gets it sometime

4507.199 --> 4512.799999999999
you don't have to be infected to get it

4510.0 --> 4516.48
people don't get infected and then get

4512.8 --> 4520.84
it people get the condition

4516.48 --> 4520.839999999999
everybody does in their life sometimes

4529.36 --> 4535.599999999999
rhinovirus or coronavirus they call it

4532.64 --> 4535.6
colds really

4536.96 --> 4542.96
i thought it was very specific to the

4539.92 --> 4544.96
to the lungs bronchi

4542.96 --> 4546.8
and the uh

4544.96 --> 4549.679
and the throat i thought it was very

4546.8 --> 4549.679
specific to that

4550.56 --> 4556.280000000001
but i don't know maybe

4552.56 --> 4556.280000000001
what you say is correct

4566.88 --> 4571.92
what copenhagen is a vascular disease

4574.88 --> 4579.56
that's the first time i've heard of that

4576.56 --> 4579.56
definition

4580.96 --> 4586.2390000000005
coronavir spike protein attacks vascular

4584.08 --> 4589.92
system on the cell what what the hell

4586.239 --> 4589.919999999999
does that have to do with any of that

4590.64 --> 4595.0
really spike protein inherent

4598.719 --> 4601.719
what

4610.56 --> 4615.719
where are you getting that definition

4612.159 --> 4615.719
from george sanford

4653.199 --> 4657.5199999999995
okay so you're just gonna leave it there

4655.36 --> 4661.639999999999
not actually clarify where you got that

4657.52 --> 4661.64
definition from george sanford

4667.52 --> 4672.1990000000005
hello rg is in the house

4686.52 --> 4693.159000000001
sci-tech daily

4689.28 --> 4693.159
what the hell was that

4693.52 --> 4696.52
what

4706.0 --> 4710.719
yeah get the hell out of here with your

4708.159 --> 4710.719
[ __ ]

4717.76 --> 4723.76
it's the title of the scitec daily

4720.08 --> 4723.76
article okay whatever

4726.88 --> 4732.88
sorry but scitec daily doesn't exactly

4730.0 --> 4735.12
sound like a reliable medical so a

4732.88 --> 4736.96
reliable medical source

4735.12 --> 4740.32
so

4736.96 --> 4744.2390000000005
unless it's somewhere on pot med

4740.32 --> 4744.239
or directly related

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
it sounds like a bit of nonsense to me

4754.32 --> 4760.32
right yeah thank you stallion8012

4757.52 --> 4763.1990000000005
i do my best it's just today seems to be

4760.32 --> 4765.199
all about this and everybody's bringing

4763.199 --> 4767.759999999999
their own piece

4765.199 --> 4772.44
of mind to the table

4767.76 --> 4772.4400000000005
it's not my favorite subject though

4776.32 --> 4781.0
the article cites a publication

4781.679 --> 4784.159
okay

4788.84 --> 4791.6
source

4790.719 --> 4793.6
what

4791.6 --> 4795.84
that's not

4793.6 --> 4797.92
the [ __ ]

4795.84 --> 4802.32
that doesn't seem to be about covid

4797.92 --> 4806.4800000000005
itself that seems to be focused mainly

4802.32 --> 4806.48
on the protein so

4813.92 --> 4817.639
i'm looking it up

4828.159 --> 4832.92
i'm getting another

4829.92 --> 4832.92
source

4834.4 --> 4839.759999999999
right

4836.48 --> 4843.12
this is all about the vax

4839.76 --> 4843.12
everything you just cited

4843.199 --> 4849.839999999999
pam cowell is specifically about the vax

4848.159 --> 4852.32
i thought so because it's about spike

4849.84 --> 4855.1990000000005
protein so it has nothing to do with the

4852.32 --> 4857.12
general covet condition with

4855.199 --> 4858.719
the sickness it has nothing to even do

4857.12 --> 4861.719
with it it's specifically about the

4858.719 --> 4861.719
vaccine

4862.56 --> 4865.84
that's what i'm getting from a

4863.76 --> 4867.76
preliminary search

4865.84 --> 4870.4800000000005
it's the first thing that popped up in

4867.76 --> 4872.8
the article the first sentence it's

4870.48 --> 4874.879999999999
about the facts it's which is in the

4872.8 --> 4878.0
facts it's an experiment genetic

4874.88 --> 4878.0
alteration experiment

4882.96 --> 4887.2390000000005
all right georgia source fine

4897.04 --> 4902.0
all right but it makes sense covered 19

4900.0 --> 4903.44
with vascular disease but that's

4902.0 --> 4906.32
[ __ ] though

4903.44 --> 4909.28
covet 19 is not a vascular disease

4906.32 --> 4911.36
this is specifically

4909.28 --> 4913.759999999999
like none of it even has to do with any

4911.36 --> 4917.5199999999995
freaking corona at that point

4913.76 --> 4919.360000000001
the facts has nothing to do with it

4917.52 --> 4921.52
it's just

4919.36 --> 4922.5599999999995
research of what the spike protein does

4921.52 --> 4925.1990000000005
here

4922.56 --> 4927.4400000000005
that's what it's about

4925.199 --> 4929.36
that's what this article that i found

4927.44 --> 4930.879999999999
based on your hints

4929.36 --> 4933.12
is about

4930.88 --> 4934.96
has nothing to do with the general

4933.12 --> 4937.199
condition it only has to do with what

4934.96 --> 4940.199
the the shot

4937.199 --> 4940.199
does

4949.36 --> 4953.5199999999995
it is how spiked parentings are not good

4951.199 --> 4957.04
for you right okay well that's fine then

4957.679 --> 4960.56
well yeah there was somebody here there

4959.36 --> 4962.719
was

4960.56 --> 4964.88
was that the guy that i banned

4962.719 --> 4967.92
he did say like ooh this doesn't do

4964.88 --> 4967.92
anything is it

4968.56 --> 4972.96
pet fee

yeah it does do things and yeah the

4972.96 --> 4976.4800000000005
article you highlighted

4976.8 --> 4982.1990000000005
basically states how

4978.8 --> 4982.1990000000005
what it does

4987.76 --> 4992.400000000001
but it is kind of like even calling it

4989.76 --> 4994.719
covet 19 or all the that's all

4992.4 --> 4996.159
misleading [ __ ] it has nothing to do

4994.719 --> 4997.92

4996.159 --> 4999.36
nothing to do with the exosome nothing

4997.92 --> 5001.4400000000005
to do with the

4999.36 --> 5002.799999999999
condition

5001.44 --> 5006.36
it's just what the freaking spike

5002.8 --> 5006.360000000001
proteins do

5020.719 --> 5025.08

see you next time

5103.6 --> 5106.6
so

5136.719 --> 5142.2390000000005
you know what i'm gonna risk actually

5138.96 --> 5142.2390000000005
calling the show today

5144.0 --> 5147.0
hey

5160.44 --> 5163.54
[Music]

5166.21 --> 5169.329
[Music]

5177.36 --> 5180.62
[Music]

5184.8 --> 5189.639
okay let's see how well this holds up

5197.04 --> 5200.48
ah

5198.159 --> 5200.48
wow

5200.56 --> 5204.080000000001
exactly hundred characters

5208.239 --> 5211.48
all right

5225.52 --> 5228.52
huh

5245.44 --> 5247.759999999999
why

5246.32 --> 5249.599999999999
george sanford you struggle to

5247.76 --> 5251.4400000000005
understand why anyone would want to be a

5249.6 --> 5253.1990000000005
guinea pig for a drug

5251.44 --> 5255.28
well because they are under the false

5253.199 --> 5257.36
assumption that it's safe and that it's

5255.28 --> 5259.44
being taken care of and that nobody

5257.36 --> 5261.599999999999
would like the government and everybody

5259.44 --> 5264.5599999999995
would never allow

5261.6 --> 5267.360000000001
hazardous medical experiments

5264.56 --> 5268.320000000001
to be performed on the unsuspecting

5267.36 --> 5271.599999999999
public

5268.32 --> 5276.159
that's why they want to be a guinea pig

5271.6 --> 5279.8
because they can't accept that it's not

5276.159 --> 5279.799999999999
that it's not good

5294.32 --> 5296.88
that's right

5305.28 --> 5310.719
not fda approved well yeah well how

5308.239 --> 5312.879999999999
about it's not even been tested properly

5310.719 --> 5315.52
according to medical guidelines and

5312.88 --> 5317.92
nuremberg code right it's not even been

5315.52 --> 5318.719
freaking tested

5317.92 --> 5320.8
it

5318.719 --> 5323.96
did animal testing

5320.8 --> 5326.08
at some point very shortly and then they

5323.96 --> 5329.199
discontinued that

5326.08 --> 5332.88
you know why because every animal

5329.199 --> 5336.719
subject every single one all died

5332.88 --> 5339.1990000000005
right now that's something else right

5336.719 --> 5340.56
very rare that on some kind of medical

5339.199 --> 5343.44
test

5340.56 --> 5346.400000000001
the the animal test subject they all die

5343.44 --> 5349.28
that's kind of like wow that never

5346.4 --> 5351.599999999999
happens that's crazy

5349.28 --> 5354.8
but they're still going to shove it off

5351.6 --> 5356.719
to the general public and say it's safe

5354.8 --> 5359.04
yeah yeah that's where we're at right

5356.719 --> 5362.719
now and that's why there's going to be

5359.04 --> 5362.719
a nuremberg 2 trial

5363.12 --> 5367.199
because this is completely out of

5364.96 --> 5368.0
control and outrageous

5367.199 --> 5370.159
to

5368.0 --> 5373.52
nazi level

5370.159 --> 5375.36
nazi level actual hitlerian nazi level

5373.52 --> 5378.320000000001
that's what this is

5375.36 --> 5379.12
total violation of every international

5378.32 --> 5381.92
law

5379.12 --> 5381.92
blatantly

5390.32 --> 5393.92
you believe that tiny one well you're

5392.48 --> 5396.32
wrong

5393.92 --> 5397.52
you believe that you're wrong there is

5396.32 --> 5400.239
no such

5397.52 --> 5402.4800000000005
amount of people it's been tested on

5400.239 --> 5405.12
no the tests

5402.48 --> 5406.4
were literally the rollout that's the

5405.12 --> 5408.639
test

5406.4 --> 5410.719
right people are being tested without

5408.639 --> 5413.12
telling them they are literally

5410.719 --> 5415.28
participating participating in a

5413.12 --> 5417.5199999999995
preliminary test to see whether it's

5415.28 --> 5420.159
safe they don't say it they just say no

5417.52 --> 5423.280000000001
it's safe just take it yeah nurenberg

5420.159 --> 5423.28
code violation

5424.0 --> 5428.719
it has not been tested on humans tiny

5426.239 --> 5430.879999999999
womble none of them have

5428.719 --> 5432.4
i don't know where you got that data

5430.88 --> 5435.4400000000005
it's a lie

5432.4 --> 5437.92
it's a lie

5435.44 --> 5439.759999999999
guarantee you it's not been tested on

5437.92 --> 5441.84
humans

5439.76 --> 5444.400000000001
admittedly so so i don't know where you

5441.84 --> 5446.4800000000005
got that rumor [ __ ] from

5444.4 --> 5448.239
some [ __ ] article or some [ __ ]

5446.48 --> 5450.4
blabberer

5448.239 --> 5453.28
they've made it up themselves it's not

5450.4 --> 5455.759999999999
true so the news was lying yeah no [ __ ]

5453.28 --> 5459.36
the news was lying

5455.76 --> 5459.360000000001
the [ __ ] you think is going on

5461.04 --> 5467.44

5475.52 --> 5481.120000000001
i can't believe i'm seeing that in chat

5478.719 --> 5481.12
right now

5481.76 --> 5485.6
like are you trying to gaslight me in

5483.84 --> 5490.1990000000005
how stupid you are

5485.6 --> 5490.1990000000005
or are you really this dumb

5497.52 --> 5503.360000000001
the bbc news is all in this

5501.28 --> 5504.4
they're part of it they're part of the

5503.36 --> 5507.12
conspiracy

5504.4 --> 5509.839999999999
and they will be part of the nuremberg

5507.12 --> 5509.84
ii trials

5511.199 --> 5515.44
like a whole bunch of other media

5513.28 --> 5517.759999999999
organizations out there

5515.44 --> 5520.239
all been part of this and government

5517.76 --> 5523.92
officials that have been part of this

thousands and thousands of people

5523.92 --> 5527.52
worldwide

5525.84 --> 5530.08
don't know how many thousands maybe a

5527.52 --> 5531.76
hundred thousands i don't know a lot of

5530.08 --> 5535.4
freaking people are part of this and

5531.76 --> 5535.400000000001
they're gonna pay

5566.56 --> 5569.659000000001
[Music]

5572.48 --> 5577.6089999999995
uh

5574.09 --> 5577.609
[Music]

5580.96 --> 5584.05
[Music]

5584.32 --> 5587.32
ah

5592.159 --> 5595.4
it's hot

5608.8 --> 5615.52
where did i get my data

5612.159 --> 5618.879999999999
i got some through everything

5615.52 --> 5622.88
i look around everywhere everywhere

5618.88 --> 5625.4400000000005
i go to even propagandized pro cove it

5622.88 --> 5628.4800000000005
facts [ __ ] although i never would go to

5625.44 --> 5630.879999999999
something as repulsive as cnn

5628.48 --> 5633.36
or bbc news

5630.88 --> 5638.2390000000005
i managed to watch some dutch

5633.36 --> 5638.239
news yesterday in between the football

5639.199 --> 5644.879999999999
oh my god

5641.28 --> 5647.36
they're just as terrible as the bbc

5644.88 --> 5647.36
god

5652.48 --> 5656.44
they're all in on it

5664.08 --> 5667.6
yeah but my my sources

5666.639 --> 5670.159000000001
are

5667.6 --> 5672.4800000000005
various different groups

5670.159 --> 5675.28
i literally well let's just say my

5672.48 --> 5677.44
sources are everyone i know

5675.28 --> 5681.28
literally everyone i know

5677.44 --> 5681.28
my healer my dad

5681.36 --> 5686.96
dutch news alternative news

5684.239 --> 5689.28
american alternative news

5686.96 --> 5690.96
german alternative news

5689.28 --> 5692.08
lots of people

5690.96 --> 5694.56
medical

5692.08 --> 5696.719
people doctors coming out

5694.56 --> 5699.280000000001
against the situation getting attacked

5696.719 --> 5701.6
getting slandered getting

5699.28 --> 5703.5199999999995
sometimes swat team than [ __ ]

5701.6 --> 5705.92
right for what they've said yeah i've

5703.52 --> 5708.400000000001
i've read and

5705.92 --> 5709.84
watched a whole bunch of it so many

5708.4 --> 5712.638999999999
things

5709.84 --> 5716.08
so many things so many sources pubmed

5712.639 --> 5717.36
stuff and i don't keep track of that

5716.08 --> 5719.199
i just

5717.36 --> 5721.04
as a preliminary

5719.199 --> 5724.08
figuring out whether if something is

5721.04 --> 5726.239
completely fabricated or whether there's

5724.08 --> 5728.159
something to it that's when i go to

5726.239 --> 5729.119
pubmed

5728.159 --> 5731.759999999999
to see

5729.119 --> 5734.08
right and they good sources like natural

5731.76 --> 5736.2390000000005
news they typically like to link to

5734.08 --> 5738.639
pubmed because they're very medically

5736.239 --> 5738.638999999999
studied

5739.119 --> 5747.04
and that's how i get my sources

5743.199 --> 5747.04
various various groups

5749.679 --> 5752.679
right

5761.76 --> 5766.159000000001
that's not the theory of evolution oh

5763.6 --> 5769.639
yes it is tiny wumble

5766.159 --> 5769.638999999999
yes it is

5771.36 --> 5774.32
or

5772.239 --> 5776.159
you you want to claim that according to

5774.32 --> 5777.36
the theory of evolution

5776.159 --> 5780.638999999999
man

5777.36 --> 5784.92
evolved from something else

5780.639 --> 5784.92
what would that be tiny wumbo

5785.44 --> 5789.759999999999
if not from an ape

5787.36 --> 5792.0
what did you evolve from

5789.76 --> 5793.360000000001
according to the theory

5792.0 --> 5796.0
right

5793.36 --> 5800.4
it sounds like you're just stuck in a na

5796.0 --> 5802.159
a mode no yes no it is about no no are

5800.4 --> 5805.679
you feeling the heat are you feeling the

5802.159 --> 5807.5199999999995
heat from your actions good

5805.679 --> 5810.159
because maybe you're locked in this

5807.52 --> 5812.88
denial position because it finally

5810.159 --> 5814.32
reached your inner consciousness yeah

5812.88 --> 5816.56
you were wrong

5814.32 --> 5818.799999999999
very very wrong you still are you

5816.56 --> 5820.88
probably can't admit it to yourself but

5818.8 --> 5822.639
at least you're feeling it

5820.88 --> 5824.84
right that means you might have a chance

5822.639 --> 5828.8
to over time get over

5824.84 --> 5832.0
yourself and get your mind straight out

5828.8 --> 5832.0
of the illusions

5832.639 --> 5837.1990000000005
but yeah first response deny deny deny

5835.199 --> 5841.48
everything everything you'll deny

5837.199 --> 5841.48
everything that's fine

5854.4 --> 5858.96
oh george sanford technically evolution

5856.56 --> 5860.639
isn't even a theory because a theory

5858.96 --> 5862.4800000000005
has proof

5860.639 --> 5863.679
evolution does not so it's just a

5862.48 --> 5865.839999999999
concept

5863.679 --> 5867.6
it's not a theory

5865.84 --> 5870.96
theory suggests

5867.6 --> 5873.280000000001
scientific experimentation

5870.96 --> 5874.96
actual empirical evidence that's what a

5873.28 --> 5878.32
theory suggests

5874.96 --> 5879.92
evolution doesn't have any of that

5878.32 --> 5883.679
actually has a long

5879.92 --> 5885.04
recorded history of machinations

5883.679 --> 5887.28
falsehoods

5885.04 --> 5889.36
fakery

5887.28 --> 5891.199
yeah on record

5889.36 --> 5894.4
still coming up

5891.199 --> 5900.159
so it's not a theory it's just a concept

5894.4 --> 5900.159
a very much unproven untenable concept

5909.52 --> 5913.679
everything has common ancestors

5916.08 --> 5921.04
oh really

5917.84 --> 5922.719
so where did it come from

5921.04 --> 5925.5199999999995
where did the

5922.719 --> 5927.28
what was our previous condition

5925.52 --> 5928.56
within evolution

5927.28 --> 5930.719
right

5928.56 --> 5933.76
what were we before we were human yeah

5930.719 --> 5935.52
yeah oh common ancestor so what was the

5933.76 --> 5938.56
previous step what were we before we

5935.52 --> 5940.4800000000005
were humans tiny wumbo

5938.56 --> 5942.719
come on

5940.48 --> 5944.08
or didn't you learn about evolution in

5942.719 --> 5947.2390000000005
school

5944.08 --> 5947.239
you didn't

5960.22 --> 5963.31
[Music]

5973.76 --> 5976.76
so

5984.32 --> 5990.48
right dkk that's right evolution

5987.44 --> 5991.5199999999995
suggests that one species changes into

5990.48 --> 5994.5599999999995
another

5991.52 --> 5996.8
without any logical evidence to support

5994.56 --> 5999.679
that

5996.8 --> 6001.84
and they do say we evolved from monkeys

5999.679 --> 6003.4400000000005
right i don't know where tiny wumbo is

6001.84 --> 6005.119000000001
not eyeing this

6003.44 --> 6007.36
i don't know why he's doing that because

6005.119 --> 6010.32
that's how it's taught yeah you are

6007.36 --> 6013.04
supposedly according to evolution

6010.32 --> 6014.5599999999995
your ancestors were monkeys

6013.04 --> 6016.639
apes

6014.56 --> 6018.56
this is kind of a difference but to say

6016.639 --> 6020.8
monkey is just more funny

6018.56 --> 6020.8
right

6020.88 --> 6024.8
but yeah you supposedly are so i don't

6023.6 --> 6027.92
know where you're getting this

6024.8 --> 6030.639
alternative view from but that's not how

6027.92 --> 6034.0
evolution is taught

6030.639 --> 6036.639
evolution says yes you're descendant of

6034.0 --> 6038.639
apes that's what it says

6036.639 --> 6040.4800000000005
humans were once apes that's what it

6038.639 --> 6043.4400000000005
says now unless you would like to

6040.48 --> 6045.5199999999995
present a good source alternative for

6043.44 --> 6047.36
that that actually

6045.52 --> 6049.4400000000005
is officially recognized within

6047.36 --> 6051.759999999999
evolution i'd like to hear about it but

6049.44 --> 6054.48
i've never heard it no evolution every

6051.76 --> 6056.96
form all says no you come from apes

6054.48 --> 6060.08
that's how it is

6056.96 --> 6060.08
so don't ah

6062.08 --> 6066.5599999999995
no you're just an ape auto from biscuit

6073.119 --> 6076.759999999999
just speak for yourself

6084.239 --> 6088.32
you don't disagree ah so you do think so

6087.04 --> 6090.88
okay

6088.32 --> 6090.88
okay

6090.96 --> 6095.36
right just know that every time some

6096.159 --> 6100.48
somebody that doesn't like

6098.08 --> 6102.08
evolution nonsense because they're

6100.48 --> 6104.239
creationist because they actually know

6102.08 --> 6105.92
what the hell is going on in this world

6104.239 --> 6108.959999999999
yeah they're gonna call it descending

6105.92 --> 6111.679
from monkeys why because it's funnier

6108.96 --> 6113.84
yeah we like to say that

6111.679 --> 6116.56
now you can be all nitpicky about it

6113.84 --> 6119.119000000001
just like to say

6116.56 --> 6122.0
according to evolution one time in the

6119.119 --> 6124.0
past a human fell out of a monkey butt

6122.0 --> 6125.92
just like in south park yeah that's how

6124.0 --> 6128.4
we like to say it

6125.92 --> 6130.8
we are ridiculing it on purpose we know

6128.4 --> 6132.879999999999
it's supposedly an ape

6130.8 --> 6134.56
and we know it's not out of their butt

6132.88 --> 6138.159000000001
so their vagina

6134.56 --> 6140.4800000000005
yeah we know that we like to just say no

6138.159 --> 6142.32
according to evolution people fell out

6140.48 --> 6144.718999999999
of monkey butts

6142.32 --> 6147.28
that's how we want to say it because we

6144.719 --> 6149.199
think evolution is [ __ ] that's why

6147.28 --> 6152.199
we like to say it that way you

6149.199 --> 6152.199
understand

6166.0 --> 6171.56
which has not okay george put it oh

6168.56 --> 6171.56
really

6182.159 --> 6185.879999999999
what did he say wrong

6190.4 --> 6196.5599999999995
making it personal now i don't see

6192.32 --> 6196.5599999999995
anything george sanders said wrong

6198.719 --> 6201.44
that wasn't me

6201.679 --> 6205.2390000000005
who said it

6215.679 --> 6220.56
auto from

6216.96 --> 6220.56
biscuit said we are eight i don't know

6224.56 --> 6230.679
right well i said it

6226.8 --> 6230.679
i like to say it

6232.0 --> 6235.28
descended from monkeys

6236.159 --> 6240.159
it's just funnier that way i know it's

6238.08 --> 6244.76
supposedly apes but there's no proof for

6240.159 --> 6244.759999999999
that either anyway it's all [ __ ]

6249.7 --> 6252.7789999999995
[Music]

6254.48 --> 6258.5599999999995
i think that the best description for

6256.4 --> 6261.5199999999995
evolution is that episode from south

6258.56 --> 6263.280000000001
park i really do

6261.52 --> 6266.8
all right so your ancestors were a bunch

6263.28 --> 6269.199
of [ __ ] fish frogs that had a baby

6266.8 --> 6271.52
that had an even more [ __ ]

6269.199 --> 6273.119
baby that eventually crawled on land

6271.52 --> 6275.119000000001
then he had a baby

6273.119 --> 6276.88
turned into a monkey and then you fell

6275.119 --> 6278.719
out of a monkey butt

6276.88 --> 6280.96
i thought that was the best description

6278.719 --> 6280.96
ever

6283.679 --> 6288.6
it makes me laugh every time i see that

6285.6 --> 6288.6
clip

6294.32 --> 6297.679
yeah that's right clutch bear adaptation

6296.48 --> 6300.799999999999
is real

6297.679 --> 6303.679
macro evolution is [ __ ] it is

6300.8 --> 6305.52
because adaptation is all about original

6303.679 --> 6306.32
design blueprints

6305.52 --> 6308.080000000001
and

6306.32 --> 6310.96
the range

6308.08 --> 6313.28
of where it can maneuver the body it's

6310.96 --> 6315.679
like what

6313.28 --> 6319.92
abilities can come from within a

6315.679 --> 6321.679
singular design and the further away

6319.92 --> 6324.4800000000005
the blueprint

6321.679 --> 6326.159
deviates through

6324.48 --> 6328.239
through adaptation

6326.159 --> 6331.839999999999
the tougher it gets and then if it would

6328.239 --> 6333.28
step outside of the standard core

6331.84 --> 6335.679
it will become infertile then it's

6333.28 --> 6338.4
actually a mutation and it will lead to

6335.679 --> 6341.6
infertility and extreme aggression

6338.4 --> 6343.839999999999
that's a fact that's like known

6341.6 --> 6346.56
through

6343.84 --> 6348.719
centuries if not millennia of

6346.56 --> 6351.280000000001
cross-breeding knowledge

6348.719 --> 6354.4800000000005
right people figure that out

6351.28 --> 6357.199
if you evade too far from a blueprint

6354.48 --> 6359.28
even with cross-breeding like dogs cats

6357.199 --> 6361.199
all that you'll fade too far then

6359.28 --> 6363.199
eventually the creature will not be able

6361.199 --> 6365.199
to replicate itself anymore and will get

6363.199 --> 6366.799999999999
all kinds of weird character traits that

6365.199 --> 6369.28
are not very nice

6366.8 --> 6372.8
that's what happens it's when you adapt

6369.28 --> 6377.84
too far out of the original design

6372.8 --> 6381.4800000000005
blueprint that god made for the species

6377.84 --> 6381.4800000000005
that's a fact

6391.52 --> 6395.92
all right see you later tiny wumbo

6394.0 --> 6398.159
i hope you're gonna actually think about

6395.92 --> 6400.719
everything that said today you really

6398.159 --> 6404.0
need to step away from this

6400.719 --> 6405.119
status surrenderist mindset of yours

6404.0 --> 6406.88
you're gonna

6405.119 --> 6409.04
not only destroy your own life you're

6406.88 --> 6411.76
gonna destroy lives of the people you

6409.04 --> 6415.8
love with that you really need to stop

6411.76 --> 6415.8
with it before it's too late

6421.119 --> 6426.159
hey dell zach hunt

6423.76 --> 6429.84
long time no see

6426.159 --> 6429.839999999999
don't know why you removed that message

6439.52 --> 6445.1990000000005
cross-breeding is healthy no pam cowell

6443.199 --> 6446.879999999999
cross breeding only within the range of

6445.199 --> 6449.119
the species

6446.88 --> 6449.119
right

6450.88 --> 6456.159000000001
we're going to try to cross

6453.679 --> 6458.159
breed one species with a completely

6456.159 --> 6461.36
different species it's either not gonna

6458.159 --> 6465.28
work or there's gonna be some very

6461.36 --> 6465.28
creepy mutation coming out of that

6465.52 --> 6470.8
right

6466.719 --> 6473.92
so for example with horses and

6470.8 --> 6476.400000000001
and donkeys there's the mule

6473.92 --> 6478.159
right and that's even kind of within the

6476.4 --> 6480.32
species range

6478.159 --> 6481.599999999999
it's still within the same specie range

6480.32 --> 6484.4
it's weird

6481.6 --> 6486.2390000000005
but those are already sterile you

6484.4 --> 6489.28
understand

6486.239 --> 6491.28
that's a crush species

6489.28 --> 6493.679
kind of within the same range

6491.28 --> 6496.5599999999995
that already is born sterile every

6493.679 --> 6498.88
single time and it's been known

6496.56 --> 6500.080000000001
for millennia

6498.88 --> 6503.84
all right

6500.08 --> 6503.84
that's not something newly discovered

6508.48 --> 6513.839999999999
hey absolute flat earth vodka

6510.96 --> 6513.84
good to see you

6530.4 --> 6534.799999999999
yeah right well george sanford look

6532.159 --> 6537.199
there is this issue with weirdo elitist

6534.8 --> 6540.400000000001
and in red people

6537.199 --> 6543.5199999999995
royalty not saying they're all like that

6540.4 --> 6543.5199999999995
well one shower

6543.679 --> 6548.8
the issue is they want to bypass the

6545.84 --> 6551.92
original design right

6548.8 --> 6554.08
they don't want to be confined to

6551.92 --> 6556.8
adaptation range within the human

6554.08 --> 6558.719
species they want to be able to become

6556.8 --> 6561.360000000001
anything they like

6558.719 --> 6563.52
that's like transhumanism

6561.36 --> 6565.759999999999
and they've been on to that for a long

6563.52 --> 6568.639
period of time because they've always

6565.76 --> 6570.56
had like oh inbreeding issues fertility

6568.639 --> 6573.36
issues so they just want to bypass it

6570.56 --> 6575.280000000001
completely they want to keep the way

6573.36 --> 6578.239
things are for them

6575.28 --> 6579.92
and literally bypass god in the process

6578.239 --> 6583.598999999999
if they could at some point just

6579.92 --> 6585.599
engineer their own offspring they would

6583.599 --> 6587.4400000000005
maybe they already have to some extent

6585.599 --> 6589.4400000000005
that we don't know about

6587.44 --> 6590.48
they would just do it they would try to

6589.44 --> 6591.839999999999
do it

6590.48 --> 6595.598999999999
the more

6591.84 --> 6596.400000000001
you move outside of the original design

6595.599 --> 6600.400000000001
the more

6596.4 --> 6600.4
infertility problems arrive

6600.56 --> 6606.320000000001
right and that's gonna stay the more you

6603.76 --> 6608.88
evade the more you try to tinker with it

6606.32 --> 6611.119
the more problems

6608.88 --> 6613.119
so yeah they might eventually get

6611.119 --> 6615.199
themselves extinct or completely

6613.119 --> 6617.92
dependent on some kind of medical

6615.199 --> 6619.04
apparatus to literally breed their own

6617.92 --> 6620.8
babies

6619.04 --> 6623.36
in machines

6620.8 --> 6624.56
because they all can't do it anymore

6623.36 --> 6627.598999999999
naturally

6624.56 --> 6630.8
that's really an elitist thing

6627.599 --> 6633.679
it's not for the common folk

6630.8 --> 6636.56
it's because they were always already on

6633.679 --> 6639.28
bloodlines and inbreeding and [ __ ] const

6636.56 --> 6642.84
for such a long time way before genetics

6639.28 --> 6642.84
were even realized

6656.239 --> 6660.32
the elite control everything no they

6658.0 --> 6660.32
don't

6665.36 --> 6668.719
i think they already did it could be

6666.88 --> 6671.119
dutch sailor i don't have any physical

6668.719 --> 6673.199
proof for that right we have suspicions

6671.119 --> 6675.92
a lot of people have suspicions

6673.199 --> 6679.119
right fantasies

6675.92 --> 6681.52
enough fantasies to go around

6679.119 --> 6683.759999999999
lots of people squirting getting fully

6681.52 --> 6686.2390000000005
sevanya over that idea like they're

6683.76 --> 6687.599
actually breeding over their alien

6686.239 --> 6690.159
stream

6687.599 --> 6692.159000000001
all kinds of the reptiles blah blah blah

6690.159 --> 6694.4
well yeah while they might be actually

6692.159 --> 6696.0
attempting to engineer their offspring

6694.4 --> 6698.32
already

6696.0 --> 6700.8
because of the typical problems the

6698.32 --> 6703.36
families had through inbreeding

6700.8 --> 6705.52
so yeah that might just be happening

6703.36 --> 6709.598999999999
i don't have any proof for that because

6705.52 --> 6711.360000000001
it's not something they just publicly

6709.599 --> 6714.08
let people know

6711.36 --> 6716.159
maybe there are some people in nobility

6714.08 --> 6718.5599999999995
circles that do do that as kind of like

6716.159 --> 6720.48
a transhumanist open project i don't

6718.56 --> 6724.88
know maybe they are i'm not super

6720.48 --> 6727.919999999999
informed about nobility my nobility lore

6724.88 --> 6730.4800000000005
never been my greatest lore

6727.92 --> 6732.159
try to keep a little track but

6730.48 --> 6735.799999999999
i'm just much more interested in

6732.159 --> 6735.799999999999
mechanical things

6737.119 --> 6739.44
all right

6745.52 --> 6751.8
scone is a better term well that's more

6747.44 --> 6751.799999999999
an indication of the spirit level

6755.28 --> 6760.639
chicken yeah whatever

6756.96 --> 6760.639
just parasitic rich people

6761.199 --> 6766.0
well maybe you could just call them

6762.84 --> 6767.52
rulers because they do a rule

6766.0 --> 6771.28
over people for

6767.52 --> 6771.280000000001
for worse or for better

6774.32 --> 6777.32
right

6804.84 --> 6809.8
huh okay that's sailor

6830.239 --> 6835.36
do i do scallops i don't know what to

6832.8 --> 6839.2390000000005
scallop what is a scallop

6835.36 --> 6839.239
to look that one up

6850.08 --> 6852.32
uh

6852.4 --> 6856.5599999999995
okay that seems to be a meal

6859.52 --> 6866.4800000000005
oh it's a shell

6863.52 --> 6868.8
multiple eyes what do they have eyes

6866.48 --> 6868.799999999999
really

6869.28 --> 6875.28
the clam i didn't know clams had eyes i

6872.0 --> 6877.84
knew they have detectors eyes though

6875.28 --> 6877.84
what

6892.4 --> 6897.799999999999
the farmers of men yeah you could call

6894.8 --> 6897.8
that

6910.32 --> 6915.679
well why are we still a fringe group of

6912.639 --> 6918.2390000000005
people on the internet well we're not

6915.679 --> 6920.639
very vast it's just that we're being

6918.239 --> 6923.919999999999
kept out of the loop of the general

6920.639 --> 6925.84
public actively admittedly

6923.92 --> 6929.4400000000005
literally in

6925.84 --> 6930.84
talks on camera by government

6929.44 --> 6934.0
social media

6930.84 --> 6937.119000000001
technicians literally said they do that

6934.0 --> 6940.0
yeah that's why that's

6937.119 --> 6943.44
why we're relatively fringe why not a

6940.0 --> 6945.599
lot of people know about the thousands

6943.44 --> 6947.759999999999
of really dedicated flat earth people

6945.599 --> 6950.32
that have made it their life

6947.76 --> 6952.08
to understand everything about it

6950.32 --> 6954.719
and to be entertaining

6952.08 --> 6956.0
and informative as much as they can yeah

6954.719 --> 6958.32
that's why

6956.0 --> 6959.679
because we're actively being kept out of

6958.32 --> 6962.159
the loop

6959.679 --> 6963.1990000000005
for a whole bunch of people

6962.159 --> 6966.48
because

6963.199 --> 6968.638999999999
yeah we rarely get new people sometimes

6966.48 --> 6970.879999999999
they let some through the net

6968.639 --> 6972.56
people insist to know about it and then

6970.88 --> 6973.52
they find us

6972.56 --> 6975.52
right

6973.52 --> 6978.4800000000005
but the vast majority just don't want

6975.52 --> 6978.4800000000005
they don't want to know

6978.56 --> 6983.280000000001
because they're too dependent on the

6980.88 --> 6984.0
dreams

6983.28 --> 6986.08
to

6984.0 --> 6988.48
to yeah to attempt that

6986.08 --> 6992.32
they have too much to lose for

6988.48 --> 6994.239
themselves for their feelings to do that

6992.32 --> 6997.199
so that's why

6994.239 --> 7000.32
and yeah we have achieved a whole lot of

6997.199 --> 7003.04
things you can say why haven't we given

7000.32 --> 7006.719
oh you mean in your [ __ ] mainstream

7003.04 --> 7009.04
society that's purely dependent

7006.719 --> 7011.679
the antecedent of being part of the

7009.04 --> 7014.0
[ __ ] lies yeah that's why we're not

7011.679 --> 7018.0
or we don't want to be that yeah we just

7014.0 --> 7020.88
want to be what we are truthfully

7018.0 --> 7023.84
we want to be truthful we're truthers

7020.88 --> 7026.400000000001
yeah we don't need mainstream attention

7023.84 --> 7029.679
it might be nice sometime in some way to

7026.4 --> 7032.48
get that but we're not going to conquer

7029.679 --> 7035.52
a mainstream position

7032.48 --> 7037.919999999999
yeah because we are truthers and we

7035.52 --> 7040.56
counter everything they do

7037.92 --> 7042.96
we point out every lie they do

7040.56 --> 7044.639
to a level that most people can't just

7042.96 --> 7046.32
gifts that they don't even know what to

7044.639 --> 7049.1990000000005
think about it anymore

7046.32 --> 7051.44
yeah that's why

7049.199 --> 7053.919999999999
we have achieved a lot we have figured

7051.44 --> 7057.28
out a whole bunch of things we have

7053.92 --> 7060.719
learned so much about mechanics the

7057.28 --> 7064.159
mechanics of academics of science

7060.719 --> 7067.04
of geology of astronomy what it really

7064.159 --> 7070.879999999999
is astrophysics physics in general

7067.04 --> 7073.36
biology we've learned so [ __ ] much

7070.88 --> 7075.599
buddy so much

7073.36 --> 7075.598999999999
yeah

7077.76 --> 7081.4400000000005
well we're not going to be able to just

7079.52 --> 7084.96
use that

7081.44 --> 7086.879999999999
adapt it to some mainstream situation

7084.96 --> 7088.719
where we're gonna be rewarded by the

7086.88 --> 7092.639
people that are spreading these lies

7088.719 --> 7095.199
actively yeah yeah laugh it up fundy

7092.639 --> 7098.56
laugh it up [ __ ]

7095.199 --> 7101.28
you're [ __ ] you're a liar

7098.56 --> 7103.360000000001
you suck up the people that would rather

7101.28 --> 7105.599
kill you that inform you

7103.36 --> 7105.598999999999
yeah

7105.76 --> 7110.8
you suck

7107.44 --> 7110.799999999999
so laugh it up fundy

7111.679 --> 7116.4800000000005
laugh it up

7113.76 --> 7119.04
right i'm gonna round out the show

7116.48 --> 7120.5599999999995
so thanks everyone for coming

7119.04 --> 7123.119
i hope you liked this show i thought it

7120.56 --> 7124.8
was really good very informative i gave

7123.119 --> 7127.199
it a little bit of a risky title so

7124.8 --> 7129.360000000001
we'll see if it if i'm not gonna get in

7127.199 --> 7131.199
trouble for that i always try to avoid

7129.36 --> 7133.199
this sort of title but i thought that

7131.199 --> 7135.04
since the entire show was dedicated to

7133.199 --> 7137.919999999999
these subjects

7135.04 --> 7140.4
i have to just call it what it is

7137.92 --> 7141.76
right so if you like this show or you

7140.4 --> 7143.839999999999
learned a lot at least it might have

7141.76 --> 7146.2390000000005
been very tense

7143.84 --> 7148.639
for some people

7146.239 --> 7150.5599999999995
