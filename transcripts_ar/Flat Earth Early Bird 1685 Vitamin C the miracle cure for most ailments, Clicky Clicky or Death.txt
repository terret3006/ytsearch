84.9 --> 92.82000000000001
weather today

87.36 --> 95.22
it started really nice but now it's this

92.82 --> 99.89999999999999
it's kind of like

95.22 --> 101.7
in between gray soup and sheep clouds

99.9 --> 103.43900000000001
so it's

101.7 --> 107.479
it's too bad it was really nice and

103.439 --> 107.479
sunny and it's there's not a lot of wind

110.579 --> 114.74
it's decently warm yesterday too

115.38 --> 117.79899999999999
so

120.96 --> 123.74
I don't know

125.64 --> 131.94
plants are doing just fine parsley is

129.179 --> 135.12
like it's undying

131.94 --> 136.85999999999999
it's doing so great

135.12 --> 139.16
I've never had a parsley we've planned

136.86 --> 142.14000000000001
before that was that would persistently

139.16 --> 144.62
do so great

142.14 --> 144.61999999999998
that's right

145.56 --> 152.04
hey fiber oats first in chat

149.28 --> 155.099
good to see you

152.04 --> 157.76
paintings are being displayed publicly

155.099 --> 157.76
oh awesome

159.54 --> 165.66
where exactly maybe you could

163.5 --> 168.92
link up the event so people could

165.66 --> 168.92
actually come and watch it

169.019 --> 174.72
do I have a wrench so you can post a

172.86 --> 178.87900000000002

anyway hello The Arc Ash hello

203.519 --> 210.659
welcome to the Early Bird chat

206.879 --> 215.04
right anyway it's Thursday the

210.659 --> 215.04
10th of August 2023

215.519 --> 219.44
uh

216.84 --> 219.44
temperature

219.63 --> 223.44
[Applause]

221.22 --> 226.28
22 degrees yep

223.44 --> 226.28
just like yesterday

230.159 --> 235.2
okay

232.379 --> 237.06
man it says it's going to be 28 degrees

235.2 --> 239.51899999999998
tomorrow

237.06 --> 242.18
holy crap

239.519 --> 242.18
okay

246.36 --> 251.239
I suspect it's going to be weather with

249.48 --> 255.84
a lot of bugs then

251.239 --> 257.459
when it's still this moist uh

255.84 --> 260.88
hope we don't get another fly

257.459 --> 263.88
infestation there's been like last two

260.88 --> 267.24
weeks it's it's finally over but like

263.88 --> 269.1
continually like swarms of flies

267.24 --> 270.90000000000003
would be sitting on the window and like

269.1 --> 273.06
we can't pinpoint where it's coming from

270.9 --> 275.28
it's so annoying

273.06 --> 277.919
it probably does come from the trash but

275.28 --> 280.08
it's like not very

277.919 --> 282.0
visible it's like they're coming out of

280.08 --> 283.5
nowhere

282.0 --> 286.259
very weird

283.5 --> 289.259
might also be like a mouse that's lying

286.259 --> 293.34000000000003
dead somewhere in a corner although

289.259 --> 295.199
yeah probably not it's just weird but

293.34 --> 298.02
fly breakouts

295.199 --> 300.199
but that's kind of over so thank God for

298.02 --> 300.19899999999996
that

300.9 --> 307.67999999999995
keeping things clean did very much help

304.86 --> 310.08000000000004
cleaning out the trash in time when it's

307.68 --> 311.639
really hot yep

310.08 --> 316.09999999999997
anyway

311.639 --> 316.1
hey Richard G and dank let's see you

318.72 --> 322.86
are you all doing

320.639 --> 326.58
I'm doing much better

322.86 --> 329.52000000000004
I'm keeping up the Triple vitamin C dose

326.58 --> 331.56
policy it's making me go through the

329.52 --> 334.139
vitamin C very quickly though so I'm

331.56 --> 335.699
gonna have to buy a new

334.139 --> 338.759
supplement

335.699 --> 344.40000000000003
part of it

338.759 --> 344.40000000000003
jar plastic jar pot whatever uh

346.259 --> 352.02000000000004
container

348.12 --> 354.979
hey LSG but it it does seem to really be

352.02 --> 354.979
doing miracles

355.02 --> 359.21999999999997
it's like

356.28 --> 361.32
my shoulder feeling feeling really

359.22 --> 363.47900000000004
recovered I feel all like

361.32 --> 365.52
waking up

363.479 --> 367.5
especially yesterday night because I

365.52 --> 370.4
triple dozed right before going to bed

367.5 --> 370.4
too now

372.6 --> 379.34000000000003
and so yeah that was really

375.6 --> 379.34000000000003
something I needed apparently

380.639 --> 386.1
it might have something to do with these

383.28 --> 388.02
weird freaky supposed things that are

386.1 --> 389.28000000000003
going around

388.02 --> 393.31899999999996
[Music]

389.28 --> 393.31899999999996
don't know if I shared that on this show

394.919 --> 400.79999999999995
but there's all kinds of weird things

396.96 --> 403.19899999999996
going on in the world of biology

400.8 --> 406.919
and it's not just people who

403.199 --> 409.199
participated in medical experimentation

406.919 --> 411.84
so it's like

409.199 --> 413.34000000000003
their suspicions of a new type of

411.84 --> 415.56
morgellons

413.34 --> 418.38
effect

415.56 --> 420.9
and it really sneaked up because this

418.38 --> 424.259
one doesn't like just growth filaments

420.9 --> 427.62
and fibers in your in your flesh

424.259 --> 430.68
but it does something very different

427.62 --> 434.0
it basically sneaks in your blood

430.68 --> 434.0
and then starts

434.699 --> 441.539
like creating sort of like sort of like

438.6 --> 446.0
cells it like create it's weird

441.539 --> 446.0
and but here's the thing like

447.419 --> 454.15999999999997
it's like alien cells but your body

450.599 --> 454.15999999999997
can't really do anything about it

454.44 --> 457.28
and

457.8 --> 462.06
they they can basically continue

460.139 --> 465.18
function but they are a drain on your

462.06 --> 468.0
system because it literally robs you of

465.18 --> 470.58
nutrients and [ __ ] it's weird but

468.0 --> 473.52
apparently vitamin C

470.58 --> 476.599
was very glad to hear that also really

473.52 --> 476.599
helps against that

476.759 --> 482.84000000000003
and I've been feeling like bogged down

479.099 --> 482.84
in different ways for quite a while

484.979 --> 490.74
so I thought maybe maybe let's try the

487.919 --> 492.02
vitamin C and if it's not that weird

490.74 --> 494.58
thing

492.02 --> 497.24
vitamin C is probably going to do very a

494.58 --> 497.24
lot of good anyway

498.419 --> 503.12
it's all kinds of things that it helps

507.8 --> 514.86
absorbic acid vitamin C salts oh okay

512.76 --> 517.52
isn't that just like the standard

514.86 --> 517.52
vitamin C

523.26 --> 530.54
like that's chemical I mean that works

526.08 --> 530.5400000000001
fine I take natural supplements actually

531.86 --> 537.32
which is basically kamukamu concentrate

538.74 --> 546.24
vitamin C directly derived from like

541.62 --> 550.68
free freeze dried camel Berry powder

546.24 --> 555.019
and this one works really well for me

550.68 --> 555.019
and I normally take one every day

557.519 --> 562.92
sorry I named take one

560.58 --> 566.0
in the morning and one in in the evening

562.92 --> 566.0
before going to bed

567.18 --> 571.5
and now I take three in the morning and

569.76 --> 573.779
three before going to bed which is like

571.5 --> 576.42
more than I've ever taken

573.779 --> 578.7
but

576.42 --> 581.88
there's like a lot happening in my back

578.7 --> 585.0
I feel like more symmetrical now because

581.88 --> 587.459
I'd been feeling like asymmetrical for a

585.0 --> 590.64
while and even though it hasn't really

587.459 --> 593.3389999999999
like resulted in visual alterations or

590.64 --> 595.86
like muscles like becoming different too

593.339 --> 598.44
much although my right side is just much

595.86 --> 601.92
sturdier

598.44 --> 604.1
the arm and all that the shoulder

601.92 --> 606.8389999999999
I've really

604.1 --> 610.74
re-symmetricized I like even with where

606.839 --> 613.019
my senses are because like

610.74 --> 617.519
besides the way you look you have like

613.019 --> 620.04
nerves everywhere and like the nerves on

617.519 --> 622.44
my left side had been burdened

620.04 --> 624.68
it's not like a uniform thing that I'd

622.44 --> 627.899
be like oh God I might have like a

624.68 --> 628.7399999999999
aneurysm thing or anything but it's just

627.899 --> 631.74
like

628.74 --> 634.08
more issues on the left side

631.74 --> 637.88
with nerves

634.08 --> 641.22
and this really like like

637.88 --> 643.74
seems to like re-symmetricize and really

641.22 --> 646.5600000000001
happy about that

643.74 --> 649.32
and also like worried because of the

646.56 --> 652.079
contrast it's like I had basically

649.32 --> 654.36
slowly drifted into that

652.079 --> 657.06
never realized like how bad it really

654.36 --> 659.4590000000001
got I got worried about it sometime but

657.06 --> 661.0189999999999
it would ignore it it's like yeah I'm

659.459 --> 663.92
ignored it's just like getting old or

661.019 --> 663.92
something but I mean

664.019 --> 669.779
I really hope that like going using the

667.68 --> 671.76
vitamin C cure for a while I might even

669.779 --> 674.579
up the dose further but I'll have to

671.76 --> 678.06
like buy some stock

674.579 --> 680.76
like yeah

678.06 --> 685.04
some extra PayPal support would be very

680.76 --> 685.04
welcome just like one of those

686.1 --> 691.44
cans caused

689.279 --> 694.14
like what the [ __ ] do I call that let

691.44 --> 698.7
can I have some advice on English like

694.14 --> 698.6999999999999
what do you call that

701.88 --> 707.9399999999999
when you talk about a container like

704.64 --> 711.06
this what do you call it

707.94 --> 713.399
I'm getting really frustrated

711.06 --> 716.3389999999999
with basic English here can somebody

713.399 --> 718.56
advise me please what do you call that

716.339 --> 720.5400000000001
that's like a thing with a lid it's

718.56 --> 722.88
supposed to be attached it's all plastic

720.54 --> 725.279
what do you call it

722.88 --> 726.42
the thing that these vitamin C things

725.279 --> 729.66
are in

726.42 --> 734.04
pill bottle a bottle

729.66 --> 737.16
bottle or canister container

734.04 --> 739.62
canister is a good one

737.16 --> 743.1
right

739.62 --> 745.2
I'll try to engrain that in my standard

743.1 --> 747.24
vernacular output so that I don't get

745.2 --> 749.7
messed that up anymore thank you for the

747.24 --> 752.42
advice guys

749.7 --> 752.4200000000001
yeah

753.62 --> 758.76
container bottle right

756.66 --> 761.04
pill box yeah

758.76 --> 763.16
but a pill box is like different because

761.04 --> 765.899
that's like what people that take

763.16 --> 767.16
Pharmaceuticals keep their medicine in

765.899 --> 769.56
to

767.16 --> 771.48
make sure that they don't take too much

769.56 --> 773.6999999999999
too little or in the wrong time that's

771.48 --> 776.22
not what that is that's a pill box

773.7 --> 777.9590000000001
that's what my mother used to use before

776.22 --> 781.639
he died

777.959 --> 781.6389999999999
ah anyway

782.1 --> 786.38
hey skeptic936 good to see you

787.92 --> 795.38
the giant bag of vitamin C so cool well

791.16 --> 795.38
slow mo Mumbai could you send me some

796.68 --> 799.9399999999999
that would be pretty cool

802.92 --> 807.86
a pot

805.26 --> 807.86
yeah

811.74 --> 815.7
days on that seven SEC exactly would

813.839 --> 819.5
work in anywhere yeah that's an actual

815.7 --> 819.5
pill box so I'm not gonna call it that

820.92 --> 827.24
I mean pill boxes are for like hospital

824.22 --> 829.9200000000001
patients and [ __ ]

827.24 --> 832.519
I am not

829.92 --> 832.519
anyway

834.779 --> 840.54
I high on trolled use what the hell

839.1 --> 842.1
okay

840.54 --> 844.579
oh you're talking to woodworking

842.1 --> 844.5790000000001
anywhere

845.16 --> 851.0
why are you saying that fiber oats would

848.22 --> 851.0
work gummy bear

855.36 --> 862.519
yeah I gotta troll quickly get the

858.06 --> 862.5189999999999
juicer while he's still fresh

867.24 --> 869.24
um

872.16 --> 877.139
I can't imagine that it would be very

874.5 --> 879.62
healthy though but

877.139 --> 879.62
anyway

889.62 --> 896.3
right but yeah slow mo moon buggy like

891.66 --> 896.3
I'd love a giant bag of vitamin C salt

896.519 --> 900.3
I just

897.66 --> 903.06
I have a suspicion I haven't actually

900.3 --> 906.24
tested it out I have a strong suspicion

903.06 --> 910.199
you can't buy that here anymore

906.24 --> 912.839
because of kodak's elementaris

910.199 --> 914.88
that might be all before your time it

912.839 --> 917.72
kind of happened around 2010 if I

914.88 --> 917.72
remember correctly

918.36 --> 924.6
where they basically like

921.66 --> 926.579
it's re-categorized and so you can get

924.6 --> 928.62
it as food supplements but you can't

926.579 --> 931.8199999999999
just like get an industrial bag of that

928.62 --> 931.82
stuff but I might be wrong

932.1 --> 935.4200000000001
I should maybe check

936.959 --> 943.9399999999999
um let's see let's just Google it

940.1 --> 943.94
vitamin C salts

953.04 --> 955.579
okay

956.699 --> 961.88
now you seem to still be able to get

959.399 --> 961.88
that here

964.199 --> 967.639
like in powder form

969.24 --> 971.899
space

984.12 --> 989.12
like

985.399 --> 989.12
250 grams

989.699 --> 993.7199999999999
I don't know if it's like in bit that's

991.86 --> 995.82
available in bigger and well at least

993.72 --> 998.48
it's still out there that's great I'm

995.82 --> 998.48
glad of that

1003.86 --> 1009.6800000000001
sell it in eBay yeah okay but I don't

1006.5 --> 1013.36
really do eBay

1009.68 --> 1013.3599999999999
like I don't really do Amazon

1015.98 --> 1022.82
well I could potentially do eBay but I I

1019.22 --> 1026.6000000000001
don't I've never really used that before

1022.82 --> 1029.8600000000001
but cool how big is the bag exactly uh

1026.6 --> 1029.86
what's the weight on it

1040.16 --> 1043.78
okay let's see

1052.58 --> 1055.96
you guys are weird

1060.86 --> 1064.76
you never bought anything on Amazon all

1063.02 --> 1068.6
right good and you yeah me too I'm

1064.76 --> 1071.78
avoiding that I almost

1068.6 --> 1073.6999999999998
published something on Amazon but never

1071.78 --> 1077.4189999999999
really got to it

1073.7 --> 1079.88
almost like one of I tried a DND book or

1077.419 --> 1083.179
like a campaign

1079.88 --> 1085.8200000000002
book for game Masters for a thing that I

1083.179 --> 1088.1000000000001
made in the early days

1085.82 --> 1090.4399999999998
was pretty much right before the early

1088.1 --> 1093.32
bird show

1090.44 --> 1095.72
but I never really pulled yeah I went

1093.32 --> 1096.6789999999999
through on it and like the layout was a

1095.72 --> 1098.72
disaster

1096.679 --> 1101.8400000000001
it didn't have a proper layout program

1098.72 --> 1104.24
didn't understand it it was just like ah

1101.84 --> 1106.3999999999999
like I need somebody that's good at that

1104.24 --> 1108.88
to help me out and I couldn't really

1106.4 --> 1108.88
find them

1123.14 --> 1128.919
okay woodworking granny bear Addie

1126.38 --> 1128.919
Soldier

1129.44 --> 1134.72
uh

1131.72 --> 1134.72
hmm

1142.52 --> 1148.96
right

1144.679 --> 1148.96
just like a typical back like that

1152.12 --> 1157.1599999999999
what's the weight on it

1154.52 --> 1159.4
exactly where the hell do I see that

1157.16 --> 1159.4
even

1163.76 --> 1169.299
where does it say

1165.62 --> 1169.299
how much is in the bag

1173.24 --> 1176.559
thousand grams

1180.38 --> 1187.0390000000002
oh okay

1183.08 --> 1190.84
right so it's yeah it's just

1187.039 --> 1190.84
that is a lot cheaper though

1192.26 --> 1198.32
than what I saw when I ordered or when I

1196.16 --> 1203.5
was looking just

1198.32 --> 1203.5
in general with the 250 grams

1205.16 --> 1211.64
but it isn't it has not become super

1207.799 --> 1214.46
expensive so that's great

1211.64 --> 1217.46
it's very useful

1214.46 --> 1221.02
right anyway I'm still using this stuff

1217.46 --> 1221.02
and that works really well

1224.6 --> 1231.3799999999999
I mean I'm using it for a reason but I

1227.72 --> 1234.44
look if that if it gets too expensive or

1231.38 --> 1237.3200000000002
if it's like I find that I'm like uh I'm

1234.44 --> 1238.88
I've become dependent on vitamin C like

1237.32 --> 1242.12
just the function

1238.88 --> 1244.22
then I'll start basically switching to

1242.12 --> 1247.8999999999999
powder because it's just a lot cheaper

1244.22 --> 1247.9
and more durable that way

1248.419 --> 1252.26
but I'm just very happy with these royal

1251.12 --> 1255.26
green

1252.26 --> 1258.14
camo Berry vitamin C supplements they've

1255.26 --> 1260.059
been really working for me

1258.14 --> 1262.4
and I'm so glad that they're in

1260.059 --> 1264.6399999999999
supplement form too because

1262.4 --> 1268.0590000000002
camo berries are like really

1264.64 --> 1268.0590000000002
horrendously sour

1268.28 --> 1272.1399999999999
I wouldn't be one of eating them

1285.32 --> 1289.059
it's a pretty cheap that's right yeah

1290.299 --> 1295.58
let's just say before the internet goes

1293.059 --> 1298.12
down I should really ensure that I get a

1295.58 --> 1298.12
bag of that

1299.0 --> 1304.1
if the internet is gonna go down if

1301.82 --> 1306.3799999999999
there's like direct signs like oh this

1304.1 --> 1308.48
is when we're gonna do it

1306.38 --> 1311.24
even if it would be a dud if they're

1308.48 --> 1314.539
like announcing a date then I'd probably

1311.24 --> 1318.6200000000001
well dude if they'd be announcing a date

1314.539 --> 1320.36
on an official internet shutdown

1318.62 --> 1324.34
that would like

1320.36 --> 1324.34
get a gigantic Rush

1325.22 --> 1329.419
to like uh quickly buy this [ __ ] before

1327.98 --> 1333.1
it's

1329.419 --> 1333.1000000000001
before you can't do that anymore

1333.26 --> 1339.02
so that would be a giant rush to stock

1336.5 --> 1342.559
up on stock before you can't do that

1339.02 --> 1344.6
anymore that would naturally happen

1342.559 --> 1347.72
because I mean ordering and all that

1344.6 --> 1349.6399999999999
would still do I mean once an order is

1347.72 --> 1352.159
made

1349.64 --> 1355.2800000000002
maybe you'd have to do it by email after

1352.159 --> 1355.6200000000001
that then like Logistics should still be

1355.28 --> 1357.6789999999999
working

1355.62 --> 1360.34
[Music]

1357.679 --> 1360.3400000000001
so

1360.38 --> 1363.2800000000002
right anyway

1363.62 --> 1367.8999999999999
teeth health

1365.179 --> 1367.9
yeah

1368.72 --> 1373.88
no it's it's actually been doing

1371.12 --> 1375.62
miracles on my jaw situation as well as

1373.88 --> 1377.659
I said I've been feeling kind of

1375.62 --> 1380.0
asymmetric I'm glad that it's not

1377.659 --> 1381.5590000000002
showing right on camera that it's like

1380.0 --> 1384.88
yeah I'm still

1381.559 --> 1384.8799999999999
damn gorgeous

1384.919 --> 1391.039
but it's like yeah I am relatively

1388.159 --> 1394.159
symmetrical looking the hair maybe is a

1391.039 --> 1396.919
bit not so symmetrical anymore but

1394.159 --> 1399.74
my face features overall but like on

1396.919 --> 1401.539
this side it just felt like

1399.74 --> 1403.82
just this

1401.539 --> 1406.52
like it's not there anymore like there

1403.82 --> 1409.46
was this hole in my face almost

1406.52 --> 1412.28
I wasn't like really like a whole but it

1409.46 --> 1416.6000000000001
it felt like lesson and it made me feel

1412.28 --> 1421.8999999999999
asymmetrical now I feel symmetrical

1416.6 --> 1421.8999999999999
just from twice triple dosing vitamin C

1423.26 --> 1425.799
so

1442.58 --> 1445.299
so

1445.58 --> 1449.9189999999999
poor Marley

1447.32 --> 1449.9189999999999
what

1450.02 --> 1455.08
all right

1451.96 --> 1455.08
gummy bear

1459.86 --> 1465.1999999999998
but yeah so my Moon book I'm certainly

1462.46 --> 1468.039
experiencing vitamin C being incredible

1465.2 --> 1468.039
for teeth health

1475.24 --> 1482.0
I mean if I'd like stop doing triple

1479.419 --> 1483.919
dosing and it like comes back and it's

1482.0 --> 1486.74
like it'll become asymmetrical and then

1483.919 --> 1489.64
I probably have to like permanently get

1486.74 --> 1489.64
on vitamin C

1496.58 --> 1498.82
foreign

1504.679 --> 1510.679
maybe I'll get like a

1507.799 --> 1515.0
big Vault somewhere I'm not a smaller

1510.679 --> 1517.46
fault yeah if I never get a place like

1515.0 --> 1520.1
of my own with like multiple rooms I'd

1517.46 --> 1522.88
probably have like a storage room this

1520.1 --> 1522.8799999999999
time for real

1524.24 --> 1529.53
where I start storing things like bags

1527.659 --> 1530.6000000000001
of vitamin C

1529.53 --> 1531.98
[Music]

1530.6 --> 1535.84
anyway

1531.98 --> 1535.84
you cannot overdose yes I know

1538.64 --> 1544.5800000000002
right so I'm literally Now using

1541.34 --> 1546.4399999999998
vitamins c as a cure

1544.58 --> 1548.48
because I normally take a little bit

1546.44 --> 1551.24
because it's always been good when I

1548.48 --> 1555.38
take vitamin C

1551.24 --> 1558.94
normally take two tablets a day

1555.38 --> 1558.94
now I take six

1584.6 --> 1587.6
foreign

1596.24 --> 1602.84
right but that yeah just constantly

1599.12 --> 1607.58
you're talking about concentrated l

1602.84 --> 1607.58
acerbic right acid

1608.72 --> 1614.2
normally like it's not concentrated I

1612.08 --> 1614.1999999999998
guess

1620.659 --> 1628.179
so probably what you would buy

1623.48 --> 1628.179
would also not be concentrated

1628.279 --> 1633.279
so you'd probably like have to order

1630.679 --> 1636.98
that specifically like from a chemical

1633.279 --> 1639.919
making company in its pure form

1636.98 --> 1642.08
or from a pharmacist or something they

1639.919 --> 1644.2990000000002
could probably get it

1642.08 --> 1647.3799999999999
because I don't think you could just buy

1644.299 --> 1647.3799999999999
that on websites

1653.84 --> 1658.279
eat three oranges a day yeah but there's

1656.539 --> 1660.32
a difference skeptic I mean yeah that

1658.279 --> 1661.76
works especially if you just like

1660.32 --> 1665.36
oranges

1661.76 --> 1668.36
but actually eating the oranges is not

1665.36 --> 1670.8799999999999
super great for your teeth

1668.36 --> 1672.02
it's having it in your system that is

1670.88 --> 1674.6000000000001
great

1672.02 --> 1677.36
but actually eating it is not so great

1674.6 --> 1679.52
so I'm very happy with like taking

1677.36 --> 1681.26
supplements like that because then I get

1679.52 --> 1684.1399999999999
the benefit and not the detriment

1681.26 --> 1685.46
because if I'd be eating oranges all the

1684.14 --> 1688.279
time

1685.46 --> 1691.76
that would start to wear on my teeth

1688.279 --> 1695.08
like palpably I would feel it

1691.76 --> 1695.08
and I don't have to now

1709.279 --> 1715.159
right but anyway one of my more favorite

1711.799 --> 1718.1589999999999
other ways to get it is

1715.159 --> 1720.5590000000002
vitamin C is through blood orange juice

1718.159 --> 1724.159
I've been specifically recommending

1720.559 --> 1728.02
blood orange juice that it's much better

1724.159 --> 1728.0200000000002
than regular orange because

1728.919 --> 1734.1200000000001
I never really got myself informed

1732.26 --> 1736.279
better it's just

1734.12 --> 1738.8799999999999
it assimilates much better when it's

1736.279 --> 1738.88
blood orange

1739.76 --> 1744.3799999999999
and that's just it's also an orange it's

1742.039 --> 1746.6
not nothing else added to it or anything

1744.38 --> 1749.98
it's just another type of orange and

1746.6 --> 1749.98
it's much healthier

1753.4 --> 1759.799
right actually I might actually get a

1756.98 --> 1762.22
bit of that yeah let's do that I'll be

1759.799 --> 1762.22
right back

1787.34 --> 1789.76
tomorrow

1807.679 --> 1814.039
all right so this is great stuff

1810.7 --> 1817.039
especially when it's like hot summer

1814.039 --> 1820.1
so good

1817.039 --> 1822.799
it's blood orange juice it's

1820.1 --> 1824.24
diameter quality

1822.799 --> 1826.399
so

1824.24 --> 1828.88
this is pretty much the best you can

1826.399 --> 1828.8799999999999
ever get

1830.299 --> 1838.58
and it's great

1834.08 --> 1841.4189999999999
it's a little less sweet but it's just

1838.58 --> 1845.799
it's better

1841.419 --> 1849.8600000000001
I mean I associate regular orange taste

1845.799 --> 1852.559
rather with candy and all that now

1849.86 --> 1855.58
this is the real stuff this is the good

1852.559 --> 1855.58
good stuff

1856.22 --> 1861.46
trust me try it out

1858.799 --> 1866.0
Don't Be Afraid by

1861.46 --> 1868.94
ooh bloodles vampire vampire orange

1866.0 --> 1870.98
juice yeah [ __ ] this stuff is the

1868.94 --> 1876.039
bomb as you say

1870.98 --> 1876.039
skeptic 936 exactly cheers

1881.14 --> 1884.239
[Music]

1887.6 --> 1894.82
but especially like when it's really

1890.72 --> 1894.82
sunny it's really pounding on you right

1895.22 --> 1900.799
and you're like I need to I just need a

1897.86 --> 1901.9599999999998
drink and maybe a bit a bit of sugar a

1900.799 --> 1904.399
bit of extra

1901.96 --> 1907.039
glucose to get going

1904.399 --> 1907.9399999999998
get like just a little glass of this

1907.039 --> 1910.76
stuff

1907.94 --> 1916.3400000000001
preferably super cool

1910.76 --> 1918.02
oh it's it's like magical it's really a

1916.34 --> 1920.48
great thing to have

1918.02 --> 1922.6399999999999
right but don't go I don't know what

1920.48 --> 1925.22
would happen if you'd like

1922.64 --> 1927.64
drink an entire bottle of this every day

1925.22 --> 1930.6200000000001
or more I don't know

1927.64 --> 1933.8200000000002
but I use it sparingly because it's well

1930.62 --> 1933.82
kind of expensive

1936.5 --> 1946.36
but yeah when it's the sun is really

1939.08 --> 1950.24
hard this is the best I mean screw beer

1946.36 --> 1953.6
screw regular orange juice screw all of

1950.24 --> 1955.779
those fizzy drinks this is the stuff you

1953.6 --> 1955.779
need

1957.86 --> 1964.9399999999998
trust me try it out unless you're like a

1961.82 --> 1968.1789999999999
real you really despise the taste of

1964.94 --> 1969.5
oranges or citrus

1968.179 --> 1974.44
yeah

1969.5 --> 1974.44
if not this is the stuff you need to try

1979.039 --> 1984.98
right and there's also an argument like

1981.62 --> 1988.12
as for the healing properties like yeah

1984.98 --> 1991.46
vitamin C the concentrated Chemical

1988.12 --> 1994.58
Works and there's some of that in here

1991.46 --> 1996.6200000000001
too but it's more than that right it's

1994.58 --> 1999.6399999999999
always

1996.62 --> 2002.7399999999998
we forget that organic

1999.64 --> 2007.0
components have like other functions a

2002.74 --> 2009.34
lot of which we just don't really know

2007.0 --> 2013.24
but if you take something in an

2009.34 --> 2016.72
unprocessed original biological form

2013.24 --> 2020.64
like squeeze juice you get all those

2016.72 --> 2020.64
other things as well

2027.039 --> 2033.82
right but like with any Citrus like

2030.299 --> 2035.799
don't consume it too much

2033.82 --> 2038.4399999999998
or your teeth

2035.799 --> 2041.5
will start to wear even though it's also

2038.44 --> 2044.44

2091.72 --> 2096.7599999999998
right don't just say look no I'm just

2094.06 --> 2100.66
only taking the powder take some

2096.76 --> 2104.0200000000004
original unprocessed organic components

2100.66 --> 2107.04
that are in this take that on top of it

2104.02 --> 2107.04
I recommend it

2117.94 --> 2120.42
wow

2144.599 --> 2147.9
hey Oz

2148.0 --> 2152.76

2150.52 --> 2152.7599999999998
see you

2156.06 --> 2159.72
our age

2162.099 --> 2168.7000000000003
okay cool thanks

2164.38 --> 2172.38
Maximus Latias for that price update

2168.7 --> 2172.3799999999997
yeah that's really decent

2181.06 --> 2187.0
I think I'm gonna give you a wrench you

2183.16 --> 2187.0
seem to be very helpful

2187.72 --> 2192.2799999999997
if you have that kind of information

2189.46 --> 2194.2
access that means now that you can also

2192.28 --> 2196.42
link it up

2194.2 --> 2198.1499999999996
right it's part also part of the reason

2196.42 --> 2200.32
why I hand out wrenches

2198.15 --> 2204.1600000000003
[Music]

2200.32 --> 2207.1600000000003
it's so that you can post links

2204.16 --> 2210.339
they're very resourceful

2207.16 --> 2212.7999999999997
then you will probably end up with a

2210.339 --> 2214.7799999999997
wrench unless you prove that you're also

2212.8 --> 2216.82
a troll

2214.78 --> 2220.32
but anyway

2216.82 --> 2220.32
so welcome to the club

2230.56 --> 2232.7999999999997
foreign

2246.839 --> 2253.18
you're not talking about water

2250.54 --> 2257.88
you're not talking about melons

2253.18 --> 2257.8799999999997
from the black water Corporation right

2259.72 --> 2263.5
Black Water melons

2271.78 --> 2276.3390000000004
no no no

2274.3 --> 2279.2200000000003
yeah it's just it's the way that

2276.339 --> 2281.82
sentence arranged itself within the chat

2279.22 --> 2281.8199999999997
there

2283.18 --> 2287.46
oh

2284.8 --> 2291.8390000000004

2287.46 --> 2291.839
anyway I got an Illuminati Castle

2301.72 --> 2306.72
talking a lot about vitamin C today I

2304.54 --> 2306.72
see

2306.76 --> 2309.76
foreign

2337.56 --> 2340.859
what's right

2342.46 --> 2345.599
slow mo

2347.56 --> 2350.339
what does that mean

2367.06 --> 2369.06
s

2370.9 --> 2373.859
what is it

2376.54 --> 2383.7
is that like the peel

2379.54 --> 2383.7
really you can eat that [ __ ]

2387.46 --> 2392.079
hmm

2389.859 --> 2395.74
well I used to always like just keep

2392.079 --> 2400.7400000000002
eating it off but not like eat the

2395.74 --> 2400.74
complete run right you juice it huh

2406.66 --> 2413.14
okay interesting I didn't know that

2409.18 --> 2415.6189999999997
should leave testosterone booster huh

2413.14 --> 2415.6189999999997
okay

2473.859 --> 2477.94
foreign

2476.26 --> 2480.9
wow

2477.94 --> 2480.9
skeptic

2481.119 --> 2484.02
that sucks

2484.24 --> 2490.0
oh wait it hasn't happened yet

2486.88 --> 2493.26
okay it's like an if I I didn't see the

2490.0 --> 2493.26
if there for a second

2507.099 --> 2512.92
but I mean yeah I don't know

2509.98 --> 2515.02
maybe you could

2512.92 --> 2518.32
get that there

2515.02 --> 2521.339
if you wanted some deer meat

2518.32 --> 2521.339
you call that

2525.94 --> 2529.7400000000002
but I don't know if you're up for that

2531.28 --> 2535.079
better to keep the gate closed

2554.14 --> 2556.68
hmm

2567.7 --> 2572.52
hey Jordan Sanford

2569.8 --> 2572.52
welcome back

2580.02 --> 2586.599
[Music]

2583.06 --> 2588.88
right venison yeah

2586.599 --> 2591.78
that's deer meat

2588.88 --> 2591.78
I forgot

2617.46 --> 2622.26
85 pound what the hell

2643.92 --> 2648.9
okay okay Maximus flat yes

2655.06 --> 2658.219
[Music]

2662.14 --> 2668.7
yeah by the way uh 2 000 milligram

2664.9 --> 2668.7000000000003
that's called 2 gram

2669.28 --> 2673.079
two grams a day yeah

2685.72 --> 2689.819
how much is one of these

2715.859 --> 2718.98
come on

2730.72 --> 2738.24
now come on what is it now

2735.22 --> 2738.24
where is it

2746.5 --> 2753.24
it's amazing by the way that I can even

2748.48 --> 2753.2400000000002
read this so freaking small

2754.359 --> 2756.9
ah

2757.66 --> 2762.72
great with that shiny background that's

2759.76 --> 2762.7200000000003
reflecting in it

2764.579 --> 2772.1800000000003
why doesn't it actually just mention a

2768.88 --> 2773.859
freaking digit a number

2772.18 --> 2776.6189999999997
the weight of the guy yeah I don't want

2773.859 --> 2779.5
to know like in five different language

2776.619 --> 2784.319
oh let the let the weight of the capsule

2779.5 --> 2784.319
and then not have the [ __ ] weight

2785.26 --> 2795.099
the only indicator is 75 of daily

2791.02 --> 2796.78
thing right the daily recommended amount

2795.099 --> 2799.98
that [ __ ]

2796.78 --> 2799.98
but how how

2801.819 --> 2804.54
member

2813.52 --> 2816.18
okay

2817.78 --> 2822.52
it says here ingredients is 500

2820.9 --> 2825.46
milligram

2822.52 --> 2828.54
but is that the whole freaking thing

2825.46 --> 2828.54
probably not

2835.18 --> 2841.2599999999998
yeah 500 mil I think it's 500 milligrams

2838.48 --> 2841.26
per capsule

2843.22 --> 2849.2999999999997
how much did you say you can absorb

2846.7 --> 2849.2999999999997
at once

2852.64 --> 2857.319
2 000 right

2855.099 --> 2861.04
hmm

2857.319 --> 2864.819
so literally taking four then would be

2861.04 --> 2867.119
the maximum that your body can absorb at

2864.819 --> 2867.119
once

2867.579 --> 2872.319
that's good to know

2869.68 --> 2874.4199999999996
so it's literally it's it's pointless to

2872.319 --> 2876.94
take more than four

2874.42 --> 2879.2400000000002
that's very useful information thank you

2876.94 --> 2879.2400000000002
for that

2886.42 --> 2889.38
foreign

2896.33 --> 2901.159
[Music]

2924.78 --> 2930.3390000000004
thank you for that

2927.88 --> 2933.2400000000002
I feel so much smarter now that I

2930.339 --> 2933.24
actually know that

2935.02 --> 2940.859
was well worth reading this the tiny

2938.2 --> 2940.859
tiny font

2951.42 --> 2957.88
so they literally think that taking one

2956.2 --> 2961.5989999999997
is enough

2957.88 --> 2961.599
really one

2962.2 --> 2965.8799999999997
isn't that just hilarious

2968.8 --> 2975.599
I must type 100 words a minute

2972.94 --> 2975.599
I must

2975.64 --> 2980.7599999999998
well I am a very fast typer I don't know

2978.28 --> 2980.76
how much

2991.06 --> 2996.42
it's like I'm semi-blind I need

2994.78 --> 3000.6600000000003
like a

2996.42 --> 3003.599
coordination like I need to see where it

3000.66 --> 3006.0
where certain points are and then from

3003.599 --> 3008.1600000000003
that point on I can like do a whole a

3006.0 --> 3012.119
whole bunch blind

3008.16 --> 3014.2999999999997
but I need to look at it every now and

3012.119 --> 3014.3
then

3028.2 --> 3033.5
yeah I actually had typing courses in

3031.319 --> 3033.5
school

3047.52 --> 3050.3
now

3051.119 --> 3058.859
aren't you all just like super glad that

3055.2 --> 3061.859
I'm not this horrendous gamma

3058.859 --> 3062.7599999999998
it's like super fast typing his gamma

3061.859 --> 3064.5
[ __ ]

3062.76 --> 3066.48
I bet there's a whole bunch of people

3064.5 --> 3069.24
out there

3066.48 --> 3072.48
I bet those gamma trolls are like really

3069.24 --> 3075.3799999999997
like perfectly quick in typing their

3072.48 --> 3075.38
shitty comments

3081.3 --> 3085.619
you cheated in your typing class that's

3083.819 --> 3087.839
hilarious

3085.619 --> 3091.02
and lazy

3087.839 --> 3093.2999999999997
no I I mean we

3091.02 --> 3095.579
I don't think was there I don't think

3093.3 --> 3097.6800000000003
there was any grade dependent on the

3095.579 --> 3099.599
typing it was just something that you

3097.68 --> 3102.4199999999996
can do I'm not sure

3099.599 --> 3104.94
I just wanted to do it because I like I

3102.42 --> 3107.4
wanted to be a good typer

3104.94 --> 3109.44
it like seemed really like a useful

3107.4 --> 3111.7200000000003
skill to learn it's like keyboards are

3109.44 --> 3113.579
are just starting

3111.72 --> 3115.4399999999996
they're not gonna go away it was to me

3113.579 --> 3117.96
it was like okay rich in the future I

3115.44 --> 3120.319
need to master this and need to use my

3117.96 --> 3120.319
agility

3120.42 --> 3124.7000000000003
to master this and so I did

3125.579 --> 3130.52
and I coordination

3127.92 --> 3130.52
quickness

3136.98 --> 3141.839
oh typing speed thingy okay

3144.66 --> 3150.66
thanks stereo 306. and hello aries106

3169.859 --> 3174.9
lazy hints kept to go internet okay

3177.119 --> 3185.6400000000003
I mean it depends on whether you're like

3180.9 --> 3187.02
just naturally logically lazy or whether

3185.64 --> 3190.98
you are

3187.02 --> 3194.48
like irrationally lazy right

3190.98 --> 3194.48
that's the real laziness

3195.599 --> 3202.099
when things go wrong because you're lazy

3198.3 --> 3202.099
that's irrational laziness

3203.579 --> 3209.2200000000003
right if it's not irrationally lazy

3206.42 --> 3212.119
there's a better word for it it's called

3209.22 --> 3212.1189999999997
efficient

3213.599 --> 3215.599
it's a bit

3257.099 --> 3260.099
foreign

3281.52 --> 3284.119
what

3286.98 --> 3291.839
okay

3289.619 --> 3294.2000000000003
I hope my keyboard's not gonna fail on

3291.839 --> 3294.2
me then

3298.7 --> 3305.8599999999997
[Music]

3302.28 --> 3308.73
oops hey

3305.86 --> 3310.88
[Applause]

3308.73 --> 3314.059
[Music]

3310.88 --> 3314.059
[ __ ] sake

3318.599 --> 3322.55
ah

3320.22 --> 3325.7999999999997
it happens all the time

3322.55 --> 3328.04
[Music]

3325.8 --> 3328.04
foreign

3334.3 --> 3354.9
[Music]

3353.04 --> 3358.099
oh

3354.9 --> 3358.099
I'm an octopus

3358.98 --> 3362.76
42 wpm

3366.54 --> 3369.619
I guess I'm pretty good

3380.579 --> 3386.94
huh

3382.92 --> 3390.48
I did terrible in my opinion I had so

3386.94 --> 3393.18
many errors it was sucky

3390.48 --> 3395.94
and it's like I had to look at my

3393.18 --> 3398.4199999999996
keyboard twice that's embarrassing

3395.94 --> 3398.42
foreign

3420.18 --> 3424.339
what did you say I was gonna have

3428.04 --> 3431.359
100 words per minute

3434.359 --> 3440.4
yeah and oh by the way just for the

3437.579 --> 3443.04
record I I want to show you

3440.4 --> 3446.2200000000003
that I'm doing that on this freaking

3443.04 --> 3449.599
dirty ass keyboard that's like 30 years

3446.22 --> 3452.64
old or more just for the record and like

3449.599 --> 3455.28
there's Keys here that just won't work

3452.64 --> 3458.9
or when you type them they go double I

3455.28 --> 3458.9
had to correct for all that [ __ ]

3459.1 --> 3463.5699999999997
[Music]

3463.74 --> 3465.74
um

3467.54 --> 3474.68
it's amazing it still works at all

3471.839 --> 3474.68
so

3476.04 --> 3480.3
far from 100 yeah but if I have a

3478.2 --> 3482.46
working keyboard I can like go much

3480.3 --> 3484.7400000000002
faster

3482.46 --> 3485.9
because then I literally don't have to

3484.74 --> 3488.339
check

3485.9 --> 3491.579
I can go even faster

3488.339 --> 3495.119
it's just that I can't afford to go that

3491.579 --> 3499.28
fast because the errors will just

3495.119 --> 3499.28
break it up the speed more

3505.68 --> 3511.6189999999997
yeah 97 is good but what about if I had

3508.619 --> 3511.619
99.5

3513.66 --> 3516.3799999999997
you know

3523.44 --> 3528.7200000000003
also it helped that the words that were

3526.14 --> 3530.94
being shown that I had the type were not

3528.72 --> 3532.799
that incredibly complicated that really

3530.94 --> 3534.96
did help

3532.799 --> 3537.2599999999998
like most of them were relatively easy

3534.96 --> 3537.26
words

3538.559 --> 3546.1800000000003
right I mean try to spell this

3543.18 --> 3546.18
establishment

3547.38 --> 3554.059
quickly like that's a word

3551.339 --> 3558.319
that most people aren't just like

3554.059 --> 3558.3190000000004
intuitively immediately on again

3559.38 --> 3564.299
right so the level the complication of

3562.44 --> 3566.96
the words that were being used were not

3564.299 --> 3566.96
super high

3567.059 --> 3570.8590000000004
it's more a general vernacular

3571.28 --> 3574.92
anti-disestablishmentarianism yeah yeah

3572.76 --> 3577.1400000000003
that was actually the word

3574.92 --> 3579.299
that's it yeah

3577.14 --> 3583.5789999999997
I couldn't even remember the exact word

3579.299 --> 3583.579
but that is that total [ __ ] word

3583.92 --> 3586.92
anti-disestablishmentarianism

3589.22 --> 3593.4199999999996
Auntie this is

3593.66 --> 3598.799
establishmentarianism ah

3596.46 --> 3602.18
the M didn't go through damn it

3598.799 --> 3602.18
otherwise it's perfect

3606.42 --> 3610.5
it's funny because the word itself is

3608.579 --> 3612.48
pretty straightforward in how it's

3610.5 --> 3615.42
composed so it's

3612.48 --> 3617.94
it's in absurdly long but to actually

3615.42 --> 3620.28
spell it out is much easier than you'd

3617.94 --> 3623.599
expect from a word that size

3620.28 --> 3623.599
it's weird how that works

3639.0 --> 3642.599
got 42-43

3653.52 --> 3658.319
but it's also yeah I had a lot of

3655.559 --> 3661.559
[ __ ] I actually want to do it again

3658.319 --> 3664.5589999999997
because it was just annoying I know I

3661.559 --> 3667.28
can do much faster I but it's just this

3664.559 --> 3667.28
freaking keyboard

3678.359 --> 3683.819
all right okay let's try this again

3680.4 --> 3685.799
maybe I'll just show it as I'm doing it

3683.819 --> 3688.14
so that you can see the issues that I'm

3685.799 --> 3690.44
having Also let's see if I can do it's

3688.14 --> 3690.44
fun

3706.26 --> 3709.26
100

3711.9 --> 3719.059
all right

3714.24 --> 3719.0589999999997
okay let's see are you ready for this

3722.46 --> 3728.04
now you of course the second time I'm

3724.859 --> 3730.2
gonna try it it's gonna go worse

3728.04 --> 3734.04
who wants to place a bet

3730.2 --> 3737.04
but because it always does

3734.04 --> 3739.44
but I'm still gonna do it just to prove

3737.04 --> 3740.7
myself correct or incorrect either way

3739.44 --> 3743.099
would be fine

3740.7 --> 3745.6189999999997
right either I'd be correct about being

3743.099 --> 3747.48
worse or I'd be even better which would

3745.619 --> 3749.6400000000003
be an unexpected win so it's going to be

3747.48 --> 3751.38
a win-win that's why I'm doing it so

3749.64 --> 3755.18
here we go

3751.38 --> 3755.1800000000003
let's do this okay

3755.28 --> 3758.1600000000003
oh [ __ ]

3757.07 --> 3760.52

3758.16 --> 3760.52
oh

3763.42 --> 3772.01
[Music]

3773.4 --> 3776.42
ah damn it

3777.599 --> 3782.46
see what happens

3778.45 --> 3784.29
[Music]

3782.46 --> 3788.58
foreign

3784.29 --> 3788.58

[Applause]

3806.1 --> 3809.199
[Music]

3810.359 --> 3813.2
damn it

3813.78 --> 3816.619
[ __ ] sake

3817.799 --> 3823.859
I was a lot faster though I think

3822.0 --> 3826.98
about my accuracy yeah

3823.859 --> 3829.619
but it's a [ __ ] I hate it

3826.98 --> 3831.92
it's really my keyboard that's bogging

3829.619 --> 3831.92
me down

3837.599 --> 3841.099
was this better or worse

3845.76 --> 3849.2000000000003
okay us

3862.68 --> 3870.0589999999997
oh it was worse than 38 words a minute

3866.76 --> 3871.98
yeah it was yeah it was because freaking

3870.059 --> 3873.8390000000004
errors man

3871.98 --> 3876.66
I didn't even know that you can

3873.839 --> 3878.7
basically not undo something like go

3876.66 --> 3880.6189999999997
back but when you finish the word and

3878.7 --> 3883.0789999999997
you're accidentally started typing a new

3880.619 --> 3884.04
one it basically doesn't allow you to go

3883.079 --> 3887.299
back

3884.04 --> 3887.299
you saw what happened

3887.64 --> 3892.68
it's an interesting test though but yeah

3890.579 --> 3896.0
if I want to be serious about this I

3892.68 --> 3896.0
gotta get a better keyboard

3896.46 --> 3898.46
um

3911.819 --> 3915.92
I should do whatever you know

3921.18 --> 3926.46
I want to do an oracle test

3923.46 --> 3929.42
how about actually challenging my my

3926.46 --> 3929.42
real skills

3930.359 --> 3933.5
intelligence test

3933.799 --> 3939.24
no I mean this was fun I don't want to

3937.02 --> 3941.28
do an IQ test I don't give a [ __ ] it

3939.24 --> 3943.819
just gets all the gamma squirt boys

3941.28 --> 3946.5
circling around again and

3943.819 --> 3950.099
whiny and oh I'm smarter and the better

3946.5 --> 3954.14
score sure you did like [ __ ] you

3950.099 --> 3954.1400000000003
IQ is [ __ ] useless anyway

3955.079 --> 3962.1800000000003
you're damn IQ test

3957.48 --> 3962.18
you scored high with a 64. okay

3966.26 --> 3974.059
[Music]

3967.799 --> 3974.059
what does the i in IQ stand for isn't it

3976.619 --> 3979.94
wasn't intelligent

3982.74 --> 3988.7
I know the Q stands for quotient

3985.92 --> 3988.7000000000003
who was it again

3990.9 --> 3993.7400000000002
I don't remember

3993.98 --> 3997.15
[Music]

4000.76 --> 4004.7200000000003
now I gotta Google it

4018.74 --> 4024.4399999999996
oh it is intelligence ah [ __ ] sake

4021.39 --> 4027.799
[Music]

4024.44 --> 4030.5
no it's not quality it's quotient

4027.799 --> 4033.319
yeah I actually know the the trick one

4030.5 --> 4035.66
and I I tricked myself into thinking

4033.319 --> 4037.52
that the eye can't be just intelligence

4035.66 --> 4039.02
that would be too straightforwards it's

4037.52 --> 4042.079
a trick right

4039.02 --> 4044.0
I fell for my own

4042.079 --> 4048.1600000000003
suspicion

4044.0 --> 4048.16
but yeah it's intelligence Goshen

4073.62 --> 4076.65
[Music]

4079.24 --> 4085.9399999999996
I hope you enjoyed me actually seeing

4082.64 --> 4088.16
the typing now you see how fast I type I

4085.94 --> 4090.319
and I always type that fast

4088.16 --> 4092.48
because there's a rush right you're in

4090.319 --> 4095.7799999999997
the chat there's a rush to say something

4092.48 --> 4097.819
very quickly because guess what

4095.78 --> 4099.62
you're responding to something that

4097.819 --> 4101.779
somebody is talking about you have to

4099.62 --> 4105.679
get there very quickly

4101.779 --> 4107.4800000000005
or the conversation literally moved on

4105.679 --> 4109.339
and now you're too late with your

4107.48 --> 4111.98
brilliance

4109.339 --> 4114.94
so yeah typing fast is really very

4111.98 --> 4114.94
important if you

4115.16 --> 4118.239
have a lot to say

4118.46 --> 4122.81
um

4119.74 --> 4122.8099999999995
[Music]

4130.339 --> 4135.739
no

4133.279 --> 4138.92
now that's not the mark of intelligence

4135.739 --> 4141.3189999999995
Gregory I am that's the mark of wisdom

4138.92 --> 4144.759
the mark of intelligence

4141.319 --> 4144.759
is boredom

4149.06 --> 4152.96
yeah

4150.739 --> 4155.9
literally

4152.96 --> 4158.0
Mark of intelligence is boredom

4155.9 --> 4161.839
somebody can pretend they're intelligent

4158.0 --> 4164.96
all day long and it can say smart things

4161.839 --> 4167.54
but they're not smart because they're

4164.96 --> 4168.62
just memorizing good tricks

4167.54 --> 4171.799
yeah

4168.62 --> 4174.8589999999995
real intelligence is literally High root

4171.799 --> 4177.44
is like a high function

4174.859 --> 4179.839
that means you solve everything

4177.44 --> 4182.178999999999
everything is solved before you even had

4179.839 --> 4184.4
your consciousness

4182.179 --> 4189.4
pay attention to it

4184.4 --> 4189.4
so you're literally bored all the time

4190.339 --> 4194.14
because nothing is a challenge

4195.14 --> 4199.58
and well the challenge will be

4197.56 --> 4202.34
non-intelligence related the challenge

4199.58 --> 4204.98
will be how freaking dumb people are how

4202.34 --> 4208.64
stubborn they are how eager they are to

4204.98 --> 4212.12
play into social manipulation and stuff

4208.64 --> 4213.76
instead of actually getting it yeah so

4212.12 --> 4216.86
boredom

4213.76 --> 4221.26
frustration with Humanity those are

4216.86 --> 4221.259999999999
telltale signs of real intelligence

4228.86 --> 4234.139999999999
right and usually people that are really

4231.62 --> 4236.48
smart are not super expressive about

4234.14 --> 4238.219
that

4236.48 --> 4241.12
because people aren't gonna have

4238.219 --> 4241.12
sympathy with them

4242.54 --> 4247.58
people are going to be like why are you

4244.699 --> 4249.86
so complaining why can't you just have

4247.58 --> 4252.46
fun why don't you just enjoy the moment

4249.86 --> 4252.46
yeah

4257.02 --> 4261.4400000000005
well the intelligent person is but ah

4259.699 --> 4262.94
don't you know what you're part of uh

4261.44 --> 4264.86
that literally these people are gonna

4262.94 --> 4266.78
condition you to freaking kill yourself

4264.86 --> 4269.98
ah

4266.78 --> 4269.98
like yeah

4271.58 --> 4277.9
but if you say that you're an [ __ ]

4274.1 --> 4277.900000000001
you're gonna be cast out

4278.719 --> 4281.719
frustration

4283.34 --> 4288.04
definitely Telltale sign of intelligence

4295.1 --> 4301.06
learnability is the marker of

4297.14 --> 4301.06
orientality yeah effectively

4309.44 --> 4312.04
but

4313.28 --> 4318.679
it's also like personal Dynamic and is

4316.28 --> 4319.82
that intelligence I it would it would be

4318.679 --> 4323.0
like

4319.82 --> 4327.58
just a person's Dynamic like how much

4323.0 --> 4327.58
stuff can you assimilate

4328.159 --> 4330.639999999999
right

4332.48 --> 4337.12
I do not have a high learnability

4338.96 --> 4346.4800000000005
but when I do find that there is room

4342.199 --> 4346.48
for learning then I absolutely

4346.94 --> 4351.04
fractal level integrated

4354.32 --> 4357.32
foreign

4359.8 --> 4363.820000000001
you're not that dumb skeptic

4371.08 --> 4376.699
right just because

4374.06 --> 4378.38
you would be the guy that say ah just

4376.699 --> 4381.0199999999995
enjoy the moment man why are you always

4378.38 --> 4384.6990000000005
so making a hassle that doesn't make you

4381.02 --> 4384.6990000000005
dumb that just makes you wise

4384.8 --> 4389.12
right intelligent people that are wise

4387.38 --> 4393.26
will also say that

4389.12 --> 4395.659
I would say that but I've also been that

4393.26 --> 4397.6990000000005
guy that a wise intelligent people had

4395.659 --> 4399.739
to tell

4397.699 --> 4401.78
because I would be impatient about

4399.739 --> 4403.82
everything I'm like ah why is the world

4401.78 --> 4406.46
so [ __ ] why is everybody delusional

4403.82 --> 4408.62
why can't we just do it right all this

4406.46 --> 4410.6
[ __ ] that's gonna come in the future and

4408.62 --> 4412.64
I don't want to deal with it I what I

4410.6 --> 4416.56
just want it to be fixed I know how to

4412.64 --> 4416.56
fix this why won't anybody listen

4417.5 --> 4420.8
and then there will be wise intelligent

4419.36 --> 4422.36
people and that say like yeah there's

4420.8 --> 4425.320000000001
just nothing you can do about this just

4422.36 --> 4425.32
the way the world works

4426.08 --> 4430.82
otherwise you're going to have a lot of

4427.88 --> 4433.28
really angry people against you that

4430.82 --> 4435.46
will think you will be meddling with

4433.28 --> 4435.46
them

4440.6 --> 4444.820000000001
people want their [ __ ] story

4448.159 --> 4451.54
are you see me Traveler

4457.659 --> 4463.159
nobody's yelling outside

4461.239 --> 4466.699
yeah

4463.159 --> 4468.08
that's just the church is like the

4466.699 --> 4470.299999999999
people are

4468.08 --> 4472.9
getting outside of the building again so

4470.3 --> 4472.900000000001
they're just talking

4476.56 --> 4480.9400000000005
they're just being American loud

4493.12 --> 4498.76
yeah that's also one indeed LSG yeah

4499.1 --> 4504.02
the smarter you are the more aware you

4501.56 --> 4506.2390000000005
become of your incap abilities and the

4504.02 --> 4511.280000000001
more stupid you will actually feel

4506.239 --> 4515.08
and the more hurt by mistakes often too

4511.28 --> 4515.08
loud Mormons yes

4524.84 --> 4527.999
[Music]

4536.06 --> 4539.06
foreign

4548.09 --> 4554.299
[Music]

4595.88 --> 4599.4800000000005
I'm hungry again

4597.52 --> 4601.9400000000005
I was thinking like where's my

4599.48 --> 4604.159
Illuminati custom oh damn it I already

4601.94 --> 4606.82
ate it

4604.159 --> 4606.82
hmm

4611.12 --> 4616.96
maybe the vitamin C is actually going to

4613.46 --> 4616.96
help me with my appetite too

4619.78 --> 4626.139999999999
[Music]

4621.58 --> 4626.14
because I do have some issues with it

4629.06 --> 4634.76
so yeah I really hope that I'm not just

4631.219 --> 4637.699
like oh I'm really Aging in this

4634.76 --> 4640.04
relatively young looking body that

4637.699 --> 4641.78
internally I'm actually like shriveling

4640.04 --> 4644.6
up or something and I really need

4641.78 --> 4646.58
Vitamin C to survive

4644.6 --> 4648.860000000001
I really hope that's not the case and

4646.58 --> 4651.86
that I can just like high dosage yet for

4648.86 --> 4656.659
a while and then drop back down again

4651.86 --> 4662.44
and then stay normal that would be great

4656.659 --> 4662.44
I hope so God if you please

4662.719 --> 4668.179
I mean I'm doing pretty good now I think

4665.12 --> 4670.82
that I could really use

4668.179 --> 4674.12
the rejuvenation

4670.82 --> 4676.78
like to actually do good

4674.12 --> 4676.78
better

4677.239 --> 4679.959999999999
hmm

4693.92 --> 4696.92
okay

4701.48 --> 4707.739
okay Mike at home that's

4704.9 --> 4707.739
insane

4710.84 --> 4716.659000000001
by talking about crazy [ __ ]

4714.159 --> 4719.0599999999995

4716.659 --> 4723.28
mentioned this yesterday

4719.06 --> 4723.280000000001
does anybody here know lift the fail

4725.659 --> 4731.599999999999
Mike uh Nathan Stopman

4729.26 --> 4734.0
used to like kind of be like a sort of

4731.6 --> 4735.860000000001
alternative news guy

4734.0 --> 4738.56
add sources

4741.14 --> 4746.12
now he's like

4742.82 --> 4749.0199999999995
dude the last time I saw a man like what

literally in a really bad place he he

4759.679 --> 4767.4800000000005

4763.94 --> 4770.78
one of those crazy hobos

4767.48 --> 4773.54
that are wandering on the street and

4770.78 --> 4775.82
in California and all that I mean he was

4773.54 --> 4778.46
on camera and he was like all twitched

4775.82 --> 4780.86

[Music]

4832.159 --> 4838.219
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with him he

worry is going to end up dead or oding

4883.04 --> 4885.88

4889.48 --> 4895.718999999999
remind you of the Morgan yeah but that's

4892.58 --> 4895.719
different though I mean

4896.36 --> 4899.0199999999995
all right

4905.84 --> 4912.1990000000005

4915.38 --> 4919.04

[Music]

4947.78 --> 4951.94
Elephant Show okay

4958.94 --> 4961.659
hmm

4965.3 --> 4971.02
yeah five roads yeah fair enough

4968.84 --> 4971.02
foreign

4976.04 --> 4979.48
what's going on now

4980.14 --> 4985.06
like kids doing games or something

4987.62 --> 4991.3
it's the Mormon Olympics

4991.72 --> 4994.779
[Music]

4995.78 --> 5001.739
but of course huge amounts of

4998.54 --> 5001.739
encouragement as always

5009.34 --> 5015.21
marvelous favorite clubbuster

5012.04 --> 5018.42
yeah in retrospect yeah

5015.21 --> 5018.42
[Music]

5018.9 --> 5022.139999999999
all right

5022.9 --> 5026.62
it's just

5024.52 --> 5030.659000000001
I had a bit of a personal peace because

5026.62 --> 5030.659
I find his voice kind of annoying

5030.76 --> 5035.860000000001
but I mean yeah you can't really do much

5033.219 --> 5038.04
about that now can you

5035.86 --> 5042.219
Jesus Christ

5038.04 --> 5044.88
it's a really like grunt on this [ __ ]

5042.219 --> 5044.88
what

5047.72 --> 5050.829000000001
[Music]

5051.82 --> 5057.5199999999995
alrighty then

5054.44 --> 5057.5199999999995
[Music]

5059.08 --> 5062.94
I guess that's normal now

5070.12 --> 5073.2699999999995
[Music]

5082.03 --> 5087.0199999999995
[Music]

5092.44 --> 5095.919999999999
that's right at least you don't lend

5094.42 --> 5098.38
away your intelligence and ability to

5095.92 --> 5100.3
see the truth that you got yourself into

5098.38 --> 5101.46
a fee or rather than you chose it

5100.3 --> 5104.56
because

5101.46 --> 5106.42
whether people realize it or not you do

5104.56 --> 5107.7390000000005
get a lot of opportunities throughout

5106.42 --> 5109.659
your life

5107.739 --> 5111.759999999999
to figure out

5109.659 --> 5114.219
that those kids recently discover sugar

5111.76 --> 5116.4400000000005
yeah well Mormons have no problem

5114.219 --> 5119.679
whatsoever with sugar

5116.44 --> 5123.719
so yeah there is definitely sugar

5119.679 --> 5123.719
addiction happening among Mormons

5123.82 --> 5132.299999999999
like they don't drink coffee but

5128.02 --> 5132.3
they'll still drink Red Bull and [ __ ]

5133.12 --> 5138.48
and like

5134.38 --> 5138.4800000000005
endless amounts of sugar so

5143.159 --> 5147.94
candy is a common thing

5146.38 --> 5150.6990000000005
among them

5147.94 --> 5153.099999999999
a loopholes yeah pretty much it's like

5150.699 --> 5155.62
you gotta be have

5153.1 --> 5157.96
you you should be allowed to be addicted

5155.62 --> 5159.76
to one sort of thing at least right

5157.96 --> 5162.219
that's like the attitude

5159.76 --> 5166.2390000000005
of all these churches

5162.219 --> 5167.8
like yeah no we allow us our public to

5166.239 --> 5169.9
be alcoholics

5167.8 --> 5172.96
oh well we allow

5169.9 --> 5175.48
our people to be sex addicts well we

5172.96 --> 5178.38
allow our people to be sugar addicts

5175.48 --> 5178.379999999999
like yeah

5179.56 --> 5182.46
it's what you get

5194.1 --> 5200.92
what is going on here

5197.65 --> 5200.92
[Music]

5201.12 --> 5206.86
right but let's try to keep it uh great

5204.52 --> 5209.38
man today is so noisy they're Drilling

5206.86 --> 5210.7
in the wall they're shouting outside

5209.38 --> 5214.04
God

5210.7 --> 5214.04
[Music]

5216.94 --> 5222.04
but yeah you get confronted throughout

5219.699 --> 5224.259999999999
your life with flat Earth sometimes

5222.04 --> 5226.179
directly sometimes indirectly sometimes

5224.26 --> 5229.92
the hint is right there sometimes

5226.179 --> 5229.92
somebody tells it to your face

5230.62 --> 5234.88
and then you either like get like what

5232.96 --> 5236.32
what are you talking about like it

5234.88 --> 5238.719
doesn't come through

5236.32 --> 5241.659
or it scares you and does come through a

5238.719 --> 5244.36
bit then you forget about like I've

5241.659 --> 5246.82
described this all over my shows right

5244.36 --> 5249.04
all the different times that I basically

5246.82 --> 5251.92
got confronted with flat Earth

5249.04 --> 5254.94
and then I forget about it again

5251.92 --> 5257.86
it's like oh Flat Earth oh

5254.94 --> 5260.379999999999
wow it all works like that that's

5257.86 --> 5262.96
incredible and I'd figure that out like

5260.38 --> 5265.06
in freaking 15 minutes

5262.96 --> 5267.219
it's like opening up a book and like

5265.06 --> 5270.280000000001
remembering everything

5267.219 --> 5273.34
and then it'd be like I can't actually

5270.28 --> 5276.219
do anything with this if I continue I'll

5273.34 --> 5278.32
literally discontinue every process that

5276.219 --> 5280.9
I've been going with with all my friends

5278.32 --> 5283.659
and everything I wanted to do

5280.9 --> 5285.4
and I my life would be over in a literal

5283.659 --> 5286.96
sense like everything would change so

5285.4 --> 5288.099999999999
dramatically and I wouldn't be able to

5286.96 --> 5290.699
go back

5288.1 --> 5290.6990000000005
so

5291.219 --> 5296.56
close the book again oh that is this

5293.56 --> 5300.6990000000005
like it never happened

5296.56 --> 5303.54
and then literally I would literally not

5300.699 --> 5303.54
remember it

5304.54 --> 5310.12
and just move on it's like literally

5307.12 --> 5313.679
yeah yeah let's move on

5310.12 --> 5313.679
I would then avoid it

5316.179 --> 5320.7390000000005
but I've never acted like a baller does

5318.639 --> 5323.56
right I've never been like oh what about

5320.739 --> 5326.678999999999
this one what about that

5323.56 --> 5330.400000000001
like and trying to keep making excuses I

5326.679 --> 5332.92
was like oh so it's a it's flat is it

5330.4 --> 5334.659
okay I would just tell me just tell me

5332.92 --> 5337.12
everything about it

5334.659 --> 5340.659
I'll just assume that you're correct

5337.12 --> 5342.58
right it's like when going with

5340.659 --> 5344.259999999999
something that's new and somebody's

5342.58 --> 5346.239
telling about it and they're uncertain

5344.26 --> 5350.38
and they're fragile

5346.239 --> 5352.86
well in that case if you actually want

5350.38 --> 5357.12
it what they have to say

5352.86 --> 5357.12
assume that they're right

5357.58 --> 5362.139
go by the perspective of assuming

5360.1 --> 5364.900000000001
they're right and then you can actually

5362.139 --> 5368.139
guide them because then the way your

5364.9 --> 5371.0199999999995
attention attunes it makes them feel

5368.139 --> 5373.96
like it's safe like you're not there to

5371.02 --> 5376.96
like point out how they're wrong

5373.96 --> 5381.1
right assume they're right

5376.96 --> 5382.96
and then as they go if they're fumbling

5381.1 --> 5386.4400000000005
or they're saying something incorrectly

5382.96 --> 5388.84
you can correct them but then it won't

5386.44 --> 5391.0
feel like you were there to criticize

5388.84 --> 5392.26
them it'll feel

5391.0 --> 5394.9
like

5392.26 --> 5396.88
you're with them

5394.9 --> 5398.679
and it's what you say for that way for

5396.88 --> 5401.08
them so they'll just be more

5398.679 --> 5403.62
straightforward

5401.08 --> 5403.62
right

5405.34 --> 5411.109
Mormons agree

5407.89 --> 5411.109
[Music]

5415.3 --> 5421.659000000001
the [ __ ] man

5418.42 --> 5424.86
by Drowning somebody or something

5421.659 --> 5424.86
no just kidding

5429.34 --> 5434.62
right but this has also been the tactic

5432.34 --> 5436.54
that I've noticed of several types of

5434.62 --> 5438.82
women especially women that weren't

5436.54 --> 5441.1
super intelligent

5438.82 --> 5443.739
but are very sociable they would

5441.1 --> 5446.5
literally hear out people and then go by

5443.739 --> 5448.659
the assumption that they're correct

5446.5 --> 5451.26
whether they understood it

5448.659 --> 5451.259999999999
or not

5452.86 --> 5458.38
and it works really well

5456.04 --> 5462.34
right and then if you like afterward

5458.38 --> 5464.62
conclude like why it's not correct

5462.34 --> 5466.84
then at least you've heard the full

5464.62 --> 5470.199
picture and then it got out of their

5466.84 --> 5472.6
system so you didn't obstruct them

5470.199 --> 5475.54
and then you can just afterward give

5472.6 --> 5477.9400000000005
some criticism without all that pressure

5475.54 --> 5481.5
still being on there of needing to get

5477.94 --> 5481.5
it out correctly right

5485.52 --> 5491.320000000001
yeah it's like Michael Jackson

5488.32 --> 5491.32
foreign

5497.44 --> 5503.0199999999995
I'll be standing on the balcony

5500.139 --> 5505.26
throwing Illuminati cut sounds to my

5503.02 --> 5505.26
fans

5534.34 --> 5537.4490000000005
[Music]

5537.699 --> 5542.44
it is kind of funny when you think of it

5539.62 --> 5544.9
like that like they're really fans of me

5542.44 --> 5548.08
man I got an Audi I got a live audience

5544.9 --> 5551.92
today they're all clapping for me

5548.08 --> 5554.5199999999995
let them ill eat Illuminati croissants

5551.92 --> 5554.52
like that

5560.44 --> 5565.239
it has a weird ironic self-deprecating

5563.28 --> 5567.34
trait to that

5565.239 --> 5569.879999999999
I find that fascinating it's like one

5567.34 --> 5569.88
more buggy

5579.52 --> 5586.860000000001
right but time is flying

5583.78 --> 5586.86
when you're having fun

5594.51 --> 5597.629
[Music]

5603.82 --> 5609.759999999999
it had just some of those they're so

5607.0 --> 5612.1
American and it's like

5609.76 --> 5614.26
every time anything happens they just

5612.1 --> 5616.4400000000005
treat it like it's a football event or

5614.26 --> 5616.4400000000005
something

5616.8 --> 5624.2390000000005
loud yeah yeah cheering and like they're

5621.159 --> 5624.239
so into that stuff

5625.719 --> 5629.139
and I mean who can blame them I mean it

5627.94 --> 5631.239
is fun

5629.139 --> 5634.42
it is and it's like Community

5631.239 --> 5638.58
encouragement and all that so

5634.42 --> 5638.58
I actually like that about them

5638.62 --> 5640.8
thank you

5651.46 --> 5655.64
[Music]

5659.56 --> 5663.46
yeah let them eat illuminatic or

5661.84 --> 5665.139
something

5663.46 --> 5667.9800000000005
maybe that's gonna be the title for

5665.139 --> 5667.9800000000005
tomorrow show

5668.26 --> 5672.179
I mean it does sound really awesome

5672.76 --> 5677.159000000001
and today's titles are kind of filled

5692.58 --> 5695.58
thank you

5704.75 --> 5707.85
[Music]

5708.54 --> 5714.76
right but by the way like why I'm

5711.76 --> 5719.6990000000005
relatively quick on the keyboard again

5714.76 --> 5719.6990000000005
it really does have a lot to do with

5720.159 --> 5726.759999999999
the clicky

5722.08 --> 5729.639
it's like the clicky sound I use my ears

5726.76 --> 5732.400000000001
for typing

5729.639 --> 5735.9400000000005
do you understand that

5732.4 --> 5738.4
how I also use my hearing

5735.94 --> 5741.299999999999
and the clicky

5738.4 --> 5746.4
is really important because the clicky

5741.3 --> 5746.400000000001
sound is like the CRC code

5746.76 --> 5756.54
cyclical redundancy check for like the

5751.179 --> 5756.54
entire patch of typing activity

5758.199 --> 5765.219
right because the the clicky sound

5761.56 --> 5766.780000000001
is supposed to like directly

5765.219 --> 5771.4
relate

5766.78 --> 5773.86
I don't know it's used I use it too

5771.4 --> 5776.92
like keyboards that don't make a sound

5773.86 --> 5779.08
when you when you type like they

5776.92 --> 5781.9
completely break me

5779.08 --> 5784.96
it's like I can't do that

5781.9 --> 5788.5599999999995
because now I'm going to literally have

5784.96 --> 5789.76
to look at every single [ __ ] key to

5788.56 --> 5792.46
type them

5789.76 --> 5795.2390000000005
and then check on the screen if it

5792.46 --> 5795.2390000000005
actually worked

5796.12 --> 5800.8
yes audible confirmation of your input

5798.82 --> 5802.0599999999995
and it's really important for me that's

5800.8 --> 5804.1
why I'm saying

5802.06 --> 5807.820000000001
like a screw

5804.1 --> 5814.08
those damn smartphones and touch pads

5807.82 --> 5818.98
and like I need the bloody clicky clicky

5814.08 --> 5821.739
I need the clicky clicky damn it I

5818.98 --> 5825.099999999999
really need it I need it on the phone I

5821.739 --> 5829.0
need it on my keyboard no clicky clicky

5825.1 --> 5832.9800000000005
means like there goes 80 to 90 percent

5829.0 --> 5832.98
of all my quickness

5834.159 --> 5839.86
every time somebody hands me like their

5837.46 --> 5841.659
stupid smartphone Could you type your

5839.86 --> 5845.199
name out I'm like

5841.659 --> 5847.9
screw that you lit just I'll just

5845.199 --> 5849.46
dictate it letter to letter I like I

5847.9 --> 5850.659
don't want to [ __ ] type on that

5849.46 --> 5853.56
shitty thing

5850.659 --> 5853.5599999999995
I hate it

5859.48 --> 5867.0
I need clicky clicky

5862.42 --> 5867.0
so give me clicky clicky industry

5867.1 --> 5872.5
there will be clicky clicky keyboards

5869.679 --> 5875.9400000000005
there will be clicky clicky phones

5872.5 --> 5875.94
or I'm gonna get you

5876.06 --> 5880.780000000001
or come for you

5879.28 --> 5884.94
you hear me

5880.78 --> 5884.94
clicky clicky is the future

5888.54 --> 5893.4
that's gonna be a part of my show title

5893.62 --> 5896.699
perhaps that is it

5902.739 --> 5907.5
and it must be it's much more

5905.02 --> 5907.5
interesting

5909.94 --> 5913.44
doesn't fit damn it

5921.58 --> 5927.6
yeah this way perfect ah come on come on

5925.06 --> 5927.6
come on

5935.639 --> 5941.9400000000005
first one

5937.6 --> 5941.9400000000005
and I want that exclamation mark

5956.739 --> 5960.659
come on how do I do this

5962.08 --> 5966.94
okay I do it without exclamation mark

5964.179 --> 5968.92
okay it'll have to do now with title is

5966.94 --> 5973.0599999999995
Vitamin C the miracle cure for most

5968.92 --> 5975.34
ailments and clicky clicky is the future

5973.06 --> 5977.679
and that's gonna be a long-standing

5975.34 --> 5980.62
thing that I'm gonna say

5977.679 --> 5982.8
so get used to it clicky clicky is the

5980.62 --> 5982.8
future

5999.09 --> 6003.26
[Music]

6003.54 --> 6009.08
click win

6005.04 --> 6009.08
hate smartphones yes

6011.82 --> 6017.82
like the damn thing is too small

6015.179 --> 6020.28
and it's freaking touchpad I mean

6017.82 --> 6022.98
it's everything that's wrong

6020.28 --> 6025.8
it's like what do you want you want your

6022.98 --> 6028.739
screen to be big and you want clicky

6025.8 --> 6031.679
clicky what's a smartphone it's a

6028.739 --> 6034.5
freaking micro screen gives you a

6031.679 --> 6036.4800000000005
headache and it's not clicky click you

6034.5 --> 6039.6
have to use the screen is clicky clicky

6036.48 --> 6042.0
there is no clicky there's no clicky

6039.6 --> 6046.04
it's terrible

6042.0 --> 6046.04
I always hated smartphones

6048.679 --> 6057.9
I mean if I'd rather have like a

6054.06 --> 6060.96
camera that's like a smartphone

6057.9 --> 6065.5199999999995
right it's just a camera you just have

6060.96 --> 6068.28
like one or two buttons

6065.52 --> 6072.3
no keyboard because it's just a camera

6068.28 --> 6074.219
now that's great in in fact like if I

6072.3 --> 6076.1990000000005
could like transform an actual

6074.219 --> 6079.86
smartphone into like

6076.199 --> 6082.86
like an overt camera system

6079.86 --> 6084.54
with potential Wi-Fi transfer of

6082.86 --> 6087.719
information right

6084.54 --> 6089.4
that would be much better to me

6087.719 --> 6090.96
because I'm certainly not going to use

6089.4 --> 6094.46
it as a computer

6090.96 --> 6094.46
or like as a smartphone

6094.739 --> 6102.32
but like how it can be used as a camera

6097.92 --> 6102.32
has been proven to be very useful

6102.9 --> 6108.239
a live rolling live recording camera too

6106.44 --> 6110.4
and that's the part where I'm kind of

6108.239 --> 6112.678999999999
envious because a lot of people do that

6110.4 --> 6115.259999999999
they use smartphones exactly for live

6112.679 --> 6117.659
streaming and photography it's like damn

6115.26 --> 6121.1
it I'm missing out on that because that

6117.659 --> 6121.099999999999
part is really cool about it

6127.56 --> 6132.3
smartphones is why we sometimes suck at

6129.659 --> 6136.0199999999995
typing yep

6132.3 --> 6138.900000000001
indeed anyway great show today I think

6136.02 --> 6140.820000000001
it was interesting it's interesting to

6138.9 --> 6144.0599999999995
do the the typing thing

6140.82 --> 6146.219
and also I I demonstrated to you like I

6144.06 --> 6149.04
sh you saw it right you saw how like

6146.219 --> 6151.8
type the F and it's like nothing and

6149.04 --> 6154.8
then I type it again and like two or

6151.8 --> 6156.84
three and like that happens a lot very

6154.8 --> 6159.719
annoying and that is really the thing

6156.84 --> 6162.84
that's obstructing me so much so now I I

6159.719 --> 6164.88
you got to see that

6162.84 --> 6166.159000000001
right if that didn't happen it would

6164.88 --> 6170.28
just be

6166.159 --> 6173.5199999999995
and it would make zero mistakes because

6170.28 --> 6175.98
I barely like the only time I even look

6173.52 --> 6178.9800000000005
at my keyboard most of the time is when

6175.98 --> 6181.199
I have to interrupt because the the key

6178.98 --> 6182.638999999999
got stuck and it over time or it didn't

6181.199 --> 6185.46
type

6182.639 --> 6188.219
like that breaks the the speed of it

6185.46 --> 6189.3
most of it anyway right I'm rounding out

6188.219 --> 6191.82
the show

6189.3 --> 6194.219
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6191.82 --> 6196.679
liked this show I thought it was fun

6194.219 --> 6198.4800000000005
and I do feel a lot better so I hope

6196.679 --> 6202.6990000000005
that I can keep that up

6198.48 --> 6202.699
like I still feel great

6202.86 --> 6209.219
I mean it's still a little like but I

6205.86 --> 6211.799999999999
mean it's not

6209.219 --> 6215.219
at least so

6211.8 --> 6219.860000000001
great I'm gonna keep up the uh

6215.219 --> 6219.86

6220.02 --> 6224.52
right so anyway hope you all like the
