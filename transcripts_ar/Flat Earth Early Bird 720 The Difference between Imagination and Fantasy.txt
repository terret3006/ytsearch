appreciated right so yeah

74.32 --> 77.36
the weather today is

77.439 --> 80.32
different again

80.56 --> 84.84
it's not such a great soup anymore but

83.36 --> 88.0
they're still just

84.84 --> 89.84
clouds rushing up there

88.0 --> 91.68
even though at ground level doesn't seem

89.84 --> 94.479
too windy

91.68 --> 96.07900000000001
there's a little of it

94.479 --> 98.24
it's not

96.079 --> 100.55999999999999
not ripping winds it's like this

98.24 --> 102.79899999999999
relatively slow but steady stream i

100.56 --> 102.799
guess

103.759 --> 109.52
and up there it's rushing

107.2 --> 109.52
see

113.36 --> 118.56
yeah not i haven't seen too much sun

118.64 --> 123.119
so far

120.479 --> 124.24
but oh well

123.119 --> 125.439
right

124.24 --> 129.32
so

125.439 --> 129.32
i got green tea

132.319 --> 135.2
it's saturday

140.84 --> 144.31900000000002
yeah ah

144.72 --> 148.48
i got notes of course

146.56 --> 149.52
even those for today

148.48 --> 151.04
because

149.52 --> 153.92000000000002
yeah there were a couple of streams even

151.04 --> 154.84
before the show started

153.92 --> 156.55999999999997
that i

154.84 --> 158.879
watched

156.56 --> 158.879
uh

159.04 --> 166.959
yeah in chat so far is seeking star wars

162.56 --> 166.959
first we'll see who else pops in

169.28 --> 173.12
but anyway yeah

170.8 --> 175.20000000000002
most probably for me yesterday is that i

173.12 --> 176.0
basically didn't have any dinner i sort

175.2 --> 180.879
of

176.0 --> 180.879
went fasting can't really explain it

181.44 --> 186.239
just didn't want it i just thought like

183.92 --> 188.55999999999997
yeah that hunger state it's better right

186.239 --> 189.92000000000002
now

188.56 --> 191.28
i guess

189.92 --> 194.72
something in my

191.28 --> 199.12
metabolism had to resolve itself

194.72 --> 200.319
and i do feel like a lot calmer today

199.12 --> 202.0
like

200.319 --> 203.28
the

202.0 --> 205.04
some of that

203.28 --> 207.04
typical restlessness that's on the

205.04 --> 208.4
background seems to have subsided a

207.04 --> 210.72
little

208.4 --> 212.4
but it's still the period i just did

210.72 --> 213.92
something with it

212.4 --> 216.4
subconsciously

213.92 --> 218.39999999999998
it worked it's very funny how that works

216.4 --> 221.92000000000002
out because there's this association

218.4 --> 224.08
with fasting even in the past

221.92 --> 224.95899999999997
that when i would feel like this that

224.08 --> 227.59900000000002
would

224.959 --> 230.799
some people would recommend that

227.599 --> 230.79899999999998
i always forget about it

231.04 --> 233.519
because

231.84 --> 235.04
in a way it makes sense because there's

233.519 --> 237.84
almost like this

235.04 --> 240.72
this weird sort of hunger sensation that

237.84 --> 242.56
doesn't really go away

240.72 --> 244.0
and if you're constantly trying to get

242.56 --> 245.519
it away

244.0 --> 248.239
then

245.519 --> 250.64000000000001
it's not too great but if you suppress

248.239 --> 252.72
it as if you would suppress hunger

250.64 --> 254.879
literally

252.72 --> 258.079
then suddenly

254.879 --> 261.12
something else starts to happen

258.079 --> 264.40000000000003
when i feel like this specifically

261.12 --> 265.919
it's yeah it's interesting

264.4 --> 268.479
now of course i'm not

265.919 --> 270.0
i still am gonna get some lunch after

268.479 --> 272.0
this

270.0 --> 275.28
and i have to eat my dinner at some

272.0 --> 275.28
point or it'll spoil

275.84 --> 281.63899999999995
fast on watermelon wow

278.639 --> 281.639
okay

282.16 --> 286.639
watermelon

283.44 --> 288.0
now for me fasting basically entails

286.639 --> 290.8
that

288.0 --> 293.199
i only skip dinner because i don't skip

290.8 --> 294.16
like i still eat something i just eat

293.199 --> 296.639
less

294.16 --> 298.16
and especially in the big bulk portion

296.639 --> 300.639
of normally

298.16 --> 301.91900000000004
i skip that part then and

300.639 --> 305.759
i do this

301.919 --> 305.75899999999996
surprisingly regularly

306.24 --> 310.56
i think i fast like

308.56 --> 312.96
like like that although it's not full

310.56 --> 316.0
fasting of course just eating less i do

312.96 --> 318.32
that at least every week

316.0 --> 319.28
it just it happens i don't it's not even

318.32 --> 324.36
a plan

319.28 --> 324.35999999999996
it it just happens and it's okay

326.72 --> 328.96000000000004
right

331.919 --> 334.41999999999996
right

332.88 --> 338.88
anyway

334.42 --> 339.59000000000003
[Music]

338.88 --> 342.68
yesterday

339.59 --> 342.67999999999995
[Music]

342.88 --> 348.08
early bird show yeah was i was really

345.759 --> 351.36
happy with that support because guys i

348.08 --> 351.35999999999996
like really need that

351.6 --> 358.08000000000004
uh so that was very handy

355.6 --> 360.0
it'll give me some maneuvering room on

358.08 --> 361.12
monday

360.0 --> 363.52
and

361.12 --> 364.4
yeah i think i can probably hold out for

363.52 --> 366.79999999999995
now

364.4 --> 368.96
this weekend

366.8 --> 369.53000000000003
uh

368.96 --> 372.68
let's see

369.53 --> 372.67999999999995
[Music]

374.8 --> 379.199
yeah i didn't watch it back though or i

377.28 --> 381.44
think i watched a part back and then

379.199 --> 383.52000000000004
something else caught my entire i was

381.44 --> 385.039
like going all over the place in media

383.52 --> 386.24
land again

385.039 --> 390.08
uh

386.24 --> 390.08
i think owen benjamin had a live stream

393.44 --> 398.639
right but when i was watching yes now

396.08 --> 400.71999999999997
remember then uh my friend from ama

398.639 --> 403.44
called me again

400.72 --> 405.44000000000005
i had a lot to share

403.44 --> 409.44
a good conversation

405.44 --> 411.599
over like two hours

409.44 --> 413.36
because yeah you know she's going

411.599 --> 414.71999999999997
through all kinds of face herself but

413.36 --> 417.12
she's like

414.72 --> 420.56
she's like really in

417.12 --> 423.84000000000003
high-end learning mode also how to be a

420.56 --> 425.759
mother of a potentially

423.84 --> 429.84
or like a

425.759 --> 429.84000000000003
spiritually brilliant child

429.919 --> 434.96
the intellect is probably also pretty

431.599 --> 436.8
high she is like really freaking smart

434.96 --> 437.75899999999996
and with all the side effects that comes

436.8 --> 439.12
with it

437.759 --> 440.16
the friend

439.12 --> 442.0
hey i

440.16 --> 444.56
was my girlfriend at some times not

442.0 --> 444.56
surprising

445.52 --> 450.56
but

447.599 --> 453.84
yeah she's going through

450.56 --> 456.08
just many realizations and kind of plans

453.84 --> 457.84
and trying to look at herself because

456.08 --> 461.28
yeah she's a single mother it's pretty

457.84 --> 463.35999999999996
difficult it's extremely busy schedule

461.28 --> 465.52
and she's now constantly

463.36 --> 468.72
like testing like

465.52 --> 471.19899999999996
what is the result of this

468.72 --> 472.40000000000003
constantly weighing off like

471.199 --> 474.8
when is

472.4 --> 476.63899999999995
rule when is it super important to be

474.8 --> 478.479
super tight schedules

476.639 --> 481.12
with the side effects that come with it

478.479 --> 484.15999999999997
on the long run in like social responses

481.12 --> 486.479
and attitude of kid like it's mega

484.16 --> 488.879
complex but yeah motherhood

486.479 --> 488.87899999999996
sheesh

489.52 --> 494.87899999999996
but she's very sharp on it and

492.479 --> 496.96
and it's very inspiring for me to hear

494.879 --> 500.24
that sort of thing because that sort of

496.96 --> 503.75899999999996
thing i guess for my future child if i'm

500.24 --> 503.759
never lucky enough to get one

504.4 --> 508.63899999999995
that's also on my mind a lot these types

506.72 --> 512.159
of things

508.639 --> 513.36
so for me it's like this is like a

512.159 --> 516.3199999999999
parent

513.36 --> 518.08
preschool this is a bit that's how i'm

516.32 --> 520.5600000000001
taking it a bit i'm just trying to learn

518.08 --> 522.24
a lot because yeah if i'm going to get a

520.56 --> 522.919
kids great likelihood they're going to

522.24 --> 525.519
be

522.919 --> 528.48
extraordinarily complex

525.519 --> 530.88
and may even at first i realized like

528.48 --> 531.9200000000001
literally a kind of like me in ways or

530.88 --> 535.2
worse

531.92 --> 536.56
like reject reality have even more

535.2 --> 540.48
trouble with it

536.56 --> 540.4799999999999
than i did originally at the offset

541.6 --> 546.24
i'm also a very different type of person

544.16 --> 549.36
with different energies as my parents

546.24 --> 552.08
like the way that all flowed out

549.36 --> 554.32
i don't know if i will be able to manage

552.08 --> 556.1600000000001
a similar situation

554.32 --> 556.9590000000001
if i'd get a kid but who knows you know

556.16 --> 559.519
that

556.959 --> 561.1999999999999
the future is right in front of me and i

559.519 --> 563.519
streamed this morning

561.2 --> 565.6
because yeah after that

563.519 --> 568.08
went to bed not too long after

565.6 --> 570.24
did some gaming though

568.08 --> 573.0400000000001
uh

570.24 --> 575.6
yeah this morning like i watched a

573.04 --> 577.92
quantum of conscious video i

575.6 --> 580.0
i don't watch a lot of his anymore

577.92 --> 582.64
because he really just

580.0 --> 584.24
he's on his very specific way of doing

582.64 --> 586.24
things

584.24 --> 589.44
and i find it distracting sometimes

586.24 --> 592.24
because he does seem to be overly over

589.44 --> 594.5600000000001
focused on details

592.24 --> 594.5600000000001
and

595.2 --> 600.72
but it is very interesting

597.68 --> 601.92
everything that he basically

600.72 --> 604.32
works with

601.92 --> 607.5999999999999
and he had this weird little thing that

604.32 --> 609.839
he shared about this

607.6 --> 609.839
is it

609.92 --> 614.399
a conjunction

612.16 --> 615.92
of saturn

614.399 --> 618.64
and jupiter

615.92 --> 620.88
that's supposedly gonna happen this 21st

618.64 --> 623.04
of december i don't know if that's like

620.88 --> 625.92
literal celestia or if it's more like an

623.04 --> 625.92
esoteric thing

626.24 --> 632.36
and that happened 20 years ago

629.12 --> 632.36
and then

632.8 --> 636.7199999999999
started to put a couple of things

634.48 --> 638.5600000000001
together

636.72 --> 642.1600000000001
it makes me kind of nervous now that i

638.56 --> 644.2399999999999
remember it again in this moment

642.16 --> 646.56
right

644.24 --> 650.16
because what happened to me probably has

646.56 --> 652.56
something to do with that also

650.16 --> 654.24
namely

652.56 --> 657.3599999999999
the previous one

654.24 --> 659.279
and my vision moment it has to do with

657.36 --> 662.0
that

659.279 --> 663.68
so what's going to happen

662.0 --> 666.399
what's going to happen this december

663.68 --> 666.399
21st

669.519 --> 673.04
really nervous in ways

671.44 --> 674.8800000000001
but i'm also

673.04 --> 676.7199999999999
realizing like if

674.88 --> 679.6
for some twist of fate i'm gonna be

676.72 --> 682.9590000000001
confronted with a similar super heavy

679.6 --> 685.519
spiritual challenge scenario

682.959 --> 687.279
as i suspect that happened to me 20

685.519 --> 690.079
years ago

687.279 --> 692.079
well i certainly do have a lot more

690.079 --> 694.8
wisdom available to me

692.079 --> 696.64
and a lot more insight on the duality

694.8 --> 698.16
complexity

696.64 --> 700.24
from a

698.16 --> 703.12
human perspective

700.24 --> 705.2
but also better grip on just

703.12 --> 707.36
if you're going to have a mindset in a

705.2 --> 710.1600000000001
very specific off frequency that has

707.36 --> 715.12
very to do with my physical life

710.16 --> 716.959
i know how to basically accept that now

715.12 --> 719.6
because of my

716.959 --> 722.399
virtual training because of

719.6 --> 724.88
getting in people's minds and realizing

722.399 --> 728.16
how that works why they're doing the way

724.88 --> 731.92
they do it see so i think

728.16 --> 734.0
if something mystical is gonna happen

731.92 --> 738.24
i'll at least be better prepared for it

734.0 --> 738.24
now i don't know what's that gonna do

738.32 --> 742.639
with myself and the world

741.04 --> 746.16
so yeah

742.639 --> 747.6
maybe just maybe

746.16 --> 750.56
there might be some

747.6 --> 752.399
distinct arwenian changes all of a

750.56 --> 754.88
sudden

752.399 --> 756.839
that i might or might not be able to

754.88 --> 761.48
explain when that

756.839 --> 761.48
occurs so yeah

770.73 --> 773.85
[Music]

779.2 --> 784.44
it is a compliment or an insult huh

788.0 --> 792.16
well the word ace is kind of

791.12 --> 795.04
odd

792.16 --> 796.48
because of the implications and ace

795.04 --> 798.7199999999999
is also

796.48 --> 800.24
the front runner front runner have

798.72 --> 801.76
consequences

800.24 --> 803.839
there are things they won't be able to

801.76 --> 807.04
do

803.839 --> 809.36
compared to none aces so it is kind of

807.04 --> 812.3199999999999
like a designator

809.36 --> 814.24
also on an esoteric level people might

812.32 --> 816.1600000000001
realize that and then choose that word

814.24 --> 820.0790000000001
specifically or not

816.16 --> 822.3199999999999
so it could be sort of said that

820.079 --> 824.88
if somebody's an ace they are in their

822.32 --> 827.12
ways alphas

824.88 --> 827.92
they're front runners

827.12 --> 831.04
now

827.92 --> 834.4799999999999
this might click with you or not

831.04 --> 837.4399999999999
that's kind of how i feel it

834.48 --> 840.16
and that way me being called an ace is

837.44 --> 841.9200000000001
one way is like a great honor it feels

840.16 --> 843.279
like a great honor that people would

841.92 --> 844.3199999999999
actually

843.279 --> 845.8389999999999
say that

844.32 --> 848.5600000000001
on the other hand it also makes me a

845.839 --> 850.72
little bit nervous because yeah

848.56 --> 853.1199999999999
if you're being placed at

850.72 --> 855.6
sort of esoterically at the top that

853.12 --> 858.399
means you always also be the one

855.6 --> 858.399
sticking out

859.04 --> 863.4399999999999
esoterically again

861.279 --> 867.04
but then again yeah i've already pretty

863.44 --> 868.0790000000001
much thrown out so much of myself

867.04 --> 871.199
that

868.079 --> 872.8
that should

871.199 --> 876.8
safeguard

872.8 --> 879.76
my esoteric position of being ace

876.8 --> 883.3599999999999
this is getting kind of weird

879.76 --> 885.04
very very esoteric i don't know if this

883.36 --> 885.76
means anything

885.04 --> 887.4399999999999
to

885.76 --> 891.12
most people

887.44 --> 891.12
there'll probably be some that'll get it

892.24 --> 895.6800000000001
right and some other people they're not

894.639 --> 897.44
a's

895.68 --> 900.88
but they are great

897.44 --> 900.8800000000001
they're definitely great

901.68 --> 906.04
you know it's just different

907.96 --> 911.1790000000001
[Music]

912.0 --> 917.46
they have another esoteric designation

914.34 --> 917.46
[Music]

917.519 --> 923.68
now of course if you basically ch chant

920.079 --> 925.279
ace at them say dude you

923.68 --> 928.16
alright that could also mean you're

925.279 --> 929.4399999999999
potentially ace are you ready to step up

928.16 --> 930.959
to that plate

929.44 --> 933.12
to stick out

930.959 --> 934.6389999999999
it's also a challenge could be seen as

933.12 --> 937.199
such

934.639 --> 939.279
see funny how that works right it's the

937.199 --> 944.3199999999999
implications of words you can take them

939.279 --> 946.959
lightly you can take them very seriously

944.32 --> 949.6
and reflect upon how others take it in

946.959 --> 951.7589999999999
the moment because if everybody takes it

949.6 --> 954.639
very seriously then suddenly

951.759 --> 956.5600000000001
the moment gains a lot of energy

954.639 --> 958.6800000000001
and then the decision

956.56 --> 961.7399999999999
becomes much more impactful

958.68 --> 961.7399999999999
[Music]

965.82 --> 970.2900000000001
[Music]

974.24 --> 978.16
hello

975.279 --> 981.8
nathan's choice of complementary

978.16 --> 981.8
choice is infectious

983.27 --> 986.35
[Music]

1000.639 --> 1004.88
too many choices don't worry about it

1002.48 --> 1006.32
anyway let's see what else

1004.88 --> 1008.0
yeah mandy young

1006.32 --> 1010.48
it's also in chat

1008.0 --> 1013.519
and take the horizon

1010.48 --> 1013.519
george sanford

1020.399 --> 1023.6
is that

1021.36 --> 1025.6
a real name

1023.6 --> 1028.16
it might be it's just there's so many

1025.6 --> 1028.1599999999999
a's in there

1037.12 --> 1039.839
right

1046.24 --> 1049.1200000000001
so yeah that's

1050.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
that's that

1054.4 --> 1059.2
it really yeah sometimes qantas of

1056.72 --> 1060.32
conscious like really hits that snare

1059.2 --> 1063.039
for me

1060.32 --> 1064.96
and other times he's just like

1063.039 --> 1066.8799999999999
just digging in the dirt and he even

1064.96 --> 1068.16
knows he knows it that's what i kind of

1066.88 --> 1071.8400000000001
love about him

1068.16 --> 1073.76
like he really understands esoterics

1071.84 --> 1076.0
he gets it

1073.76 --> 1078.559
and he has his own

1076.0 --> 1080.4
type of language set

1078.559 --> 1084.08
to explain that

1080.4 --> 1086.64
because esoterics is against a word it's

1084.08 --> 1088.48
the core essence and there's many ways

1086.64 --> 1090.24
to approach it

1088.48 --> 1093.76
many angles

1090.24 --> 1095.919
to direct people to make them understand

1093.76 --> 1098.559
and he has his own vernacular and it

1095.919 --> 1100.0800000000002
really yeah it is kind of cool that he's

1098.559 --> 1102.08
there

1100.08 --> 1105.1999999999998
but i i personally don't always find him

1102.08 --> 1105.1999999999998
interesting because he gets so

1105.36 --> 1109.84
digging in the details all the time and

1107.2 --> 1109.8400000000001
that's

1110.16 --> 1115.919
i guess i dig in details myself but in

1113.28 --> 1120.0
my case i dig in

1115.919 --> 1122.72
cosmogeny that's that's my lego set

1120.0 --> 1126.08
that's my detail [ __ ]

1122.72 --> 1126.08
and i'm very open about that

1126.96 --> 1131.2
now of course also other things but

1128.799 --> 1132.559
that's the part that i'm very confident

1131.2 --> 1134.48
that i'll

1132.559 --> 1137.9189999999999
keep succeeding

1134.48 --> 1139.6
because i do like to involve myself in

1137.919 --> 1141.44
thinking and potentially predicting

1139.6 --> 1142.7199999999998
other things figuring things out trying

1141.44 --> 1143.76
to

1142.72 --> 1147.1200000000001
light

1143.76 --> 1149.919
that idea ahead of the growing curve of

1147.12 --> 1151.76
the rest i like doing that a lot because

1149.919 --> 1154.0800000000002
you just see things ahead of time even

1151.76 --> 1157.28
when i don't yet understand it i still

1154.08 --> 1159.1999999999998
see enough and trust my insight and what

1157.28 --> 1161.84
i learned about

1159.2 --> 1164.16
seeing things and what

1161.84 --> 1167.28
you can learn from just seeing things

1164.16 --> 1169.28
even if you can't really pinpoint it

1167.28 --> 1170.799
it's like you take a photograph and then

1169.28 --> 1174.0
you just spend a lot of time just

1170.799 --> 1174.0
studying that photograph

1176.559 --> 1181.039
right so my thing is also psychology and

1178.96 --> 1183.44
of course the visualization part which

1181.039 --> 1185.44
is critical to my

1183.44 --> 1187.039
mastery of cosmogeny if you don't have

1185.44 --> 1189.6000000000001
that it's just gonna

1187.039 --> 1191.6
you're either gonna resort to math on

1189.6 --> 1193.12
everything and then get really confused

1191.6 --> 1194.799
by that

1193.12 --> 1196.08
or yeah things are going to give you a

1194.799 --> 1197.9189999999999
headache and then you're going to

1196.08 --> 1201.1589999999999
probably resort to physicality

1197.919 --> 1203.2
assumption bias habits and jump to

1201.159 --> 1207.8400000000001
oversimplifications to make it all fit

1203.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
easier this is what most people do

1209.36 --> 1214.6399999999999
all right anyway uh also took a look at

1212.72 --> 1217.52
joyce and then the disparity family went

1214.64 --> 1219.039
live he's always on to protesting these

1217.52 --> 1220.8799999999999
days always

1219.039 --> 1222.08
and i was watching and then suddenly you

1220.88 --> 1223.2800000000002
noticed that

1222.08 --> 1225.1999999999998
robin

1223.28 --> 1227.12
who's also like part of that crew i met

1225.2 --> 1228.72
robin it's pretty awesome guy like he

1227.12 --> 1231.36
got arrested

1228.72 --> 1231.3600000000001
what the [ __ ]

1232.88 --> 1236.5590000000002
not very harshly

1234.88 --> 1239.5200000000002
but i don't know man

1236.559 --> 1240.3999999999999
yeah they went to some lockdown protest

1239.52 --> 1242.0
thing

1240.4 --> 1244.159
and yeah police

1242.0 --> 1245.52
basically put him in a van

1244.159 --> 1247.6000000000001
i

1245.52 --> 1251.2
i don't know how that ended

1247.6 --> 1253.4399999999998
but that happened like this morning

1251.2 --> 1255.3600000000001
it literally happened right there so

1253.44 --> 1259.3200000000002
that was pretty weird

1255.36 --> 1259.32
hope things will be alright

1262.4 --> 1267.52
so yeah jason and the disberry family

1265.52 --> 1270.32
it's kind of the same clique

1267.52 --> 1273.9189999999999
as also roxanne you know they were also

1270.32 --> 1275.52
like together in the whole uh to flatter

1273.919 --> 1278.3200000000002
tour

1275.52 --> 1278.32
situation

1278.799 --> 1282.799
they were like this yeah

1281.039 --> 1284.1589999999999
but anyway

1282.799 --> 1286.32
that happened

1284.159 --> 1290.1200000000001
and then yeah the flat earth early bird

1286.32 --> 1290.12
show started up so

1291.28 --> 1295.9189999999999
and that's

1292.64 --> 1299.64
as far as my report go for the last

1295.919 --> 1299.64
23 hours

1310.88 --> 1314.3600000000001
a more colored

1325.6 --> 1331.4399999999998
isn't detail the same as context

1328.72 --> 1333.84
yeah too of course

1331.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
but yeah

1334.159 --> 1338.5590000000002
but it is also like what are you going

1336.159 --> 1341.6000000000001
to cross-reference constantly with the

1338.559 --> 1342.799
details and thus the context

1341.6 --> 1345.6789999999999
and

1342.799 --> 1346.4
matt has a lot of specific angles of

1345.679 --> 1348.72
approach

1346.4 --> 1350.72
definitely like in

1348.72 --> 1353.52
the geomatria

1350.72 --> 1356.48
direction astrology very focused on like

1353.52 --> 1356.48
elite thinking

1358.559 --> 1364.08
that occult system he's very focused on

1361.919 --> 1364.0800000000002
that

1365.2 --> 1369.28
and he's he's unrooting

1367.28 --> 1371.2
giant amounts of interesting things

1369.28 --> 1373.28
basically also

1371.2 --> 1376.4
through that method i guess

1373.28 --> 1377.52
back engineering moments and things that

1376.4 --> 1380.96
are

1377.52 --> 1384.44
bound to come as it were

1380.96 --> 1384.44
because of that

1390.64 --> 1395.039
it's belta

1393.44 --> 1398.0
geordi

1395.039 --> 1398.0
for ace what

1398.72 --> 1406.22
what does that mean sean thornhill

1403.12 --> 1411.31
hey vegan bear

1406.22 --> 1411.31

1423.2 --> 1426.159
in your dialect

1430.08 --> 1433.279
what dialect is that

1435.039 --> 1438.919
i've never heard of that

1440.3 --> 1445.71
[Music]

1449.44 --> 1452.44
so

1458.159 --> 1465.96
did you already know the england what

1462.159 --> 1465.96
a becky macintosh

1472.32 --> 1475.279
all right ian

1481.12 --> 1485.1999999999998
all right well that's the thing about

1482.88 --> 1487.0390000000002
the funny name about that name ace

1485.2 --> 1490.159
ventura if you think about it it is

1487.039 --> 1490.1589999999999
literally just saying

1490.799 --> 1494.96
leader

1491.84 --> 1498.08
venturing forth

1494.96 --> 1498.08
it's basically like a

1498.84 --> 1503.9189999999999
yeah

1500.72 --> 1505.44
ventura you venture

1503.919 --> 1507.679
you move

1505.44 --> 1507.679
so

1507.84 --> 1512.72
the leader

1509.2 --> 1515.2
leads the front moving into the unknown

1512.72 --> 1518.0
or the new thing

1515.2 --> 1518.0
funny isn't it

1520.4 --> 1526.3600000000001
now ace ventura was of course a pretty

1522.48 --> 1526.3600000000001
nutty megalomaniacal

1527.679 --> 1532.24
eccentric

1529.52 --> 1534.48
as somebody who was sort of taking the

1532.24 --> 1534.48
lead

1535.84 --> 1540.3999999999999
like the sort of the joke was in that

1538.0 --> 1543.2
movie that he was basically in over his

1540.4 --> 1544.799
head he was brave but also

1543.2 --> 1546.64
didn't know what the [ __ ] he was doing

1544.799 --> 1548.96
at the same time at times and then kind

1546.64 --> 1551.039
of panicked it like it was all a joke

1548.96 --> 1552.64
about somebody

1551.039 --> 1555.36
who was just

1552.64 --> 1558.4
in over their heads naughty could barely

1555.36 --> 1558.3999999999999
control themselves

1559.76 --> 1565.52
but did kind of manage

1562.0 --> 1568.64
in the end and also through his weakness

1565.52 --> 1571.12
also binded things like he was

1568.64 --> 1573.039
remember that crazy scene with the

1571.12 --> 1575.76
arrows in the knee and they were all

1573.039 --> 1578.64
just laughing this [ __ ] out of that

1575.76 --> 1581.52
you don't understand because he was also

1578.64 --> 1583.76
being a clown and that was part of the

1581.52 --> 1585.84
story even it was not just for the

1583.76 --> 1588.64
amusement of the audi it's

1585.84 --> 1591.36
that movie is freaking weird man

1588.64 --> 1591.3600000000001
it's weird

1591.919 --> 1598.8400000000001
there's a lot of like secret chemistry

1594.159 --> 1598.8400000000001
happening in that movie it's weird

[Music]

1608.49 --> 1613.66
[Music]

1619.12 --> 1625.32
nathan oakley sent you all right becky

1621.52 --> 1625.32
mcintosh well welcome

1629.84 --> 1634.08
imagination is the process killer of the

1632.4 --> 1636.0800000000002
scientific method

1634.08 --> 1638.24
what

1636.08 --> 1641.6789999999999
no it's the other way around

1638.24 --> 1644.96
scientific method is the

1641.679 --> 1644.96
the thing that kind of like

1645.6 --> 1652.399
pops the bubble of

1647.919 --> 1654.3990000000001
imagine imaginary potential

1652.399 --> 1657.36
that's what the scientific method does

1654.399 --> 1657.36
it's the other way around

1657.919 --> 1662.279
and i think that's probably what you

1659.279 --> 1662.279
meant

1668.64 --> 1670.88
right

1679.919 --> 1683.64
right vegan bear

1683.69 --> 1686.739
[Music]

1688.48 --> 1692.799
yeah i don't know what's happening man

1691.12 --> 1694.32
it's just

1692.799 --> 1698.8799999999999
there's just some really deep

1694.32 --> 1698.8799999999999
shenanigans happening on multiple levels

1701.039 --> 1706.869
and what's good yeah

1703.83 --> 1706.869
[Music]

1707.52 --> 1714.08
i at this point i barely even want to

1711.679 --> 1716.48
try to inquire what the final result

1714.08 --> 1716.48
will be

1717.36 --> 1722.559
looking into the deep

1719.2 --> 1725.919
because there's just so much to be said

1722.559 --> 1729.2
from better sources that are closer to

1725.919 --> 1731.3600000000001
what is actually happening

1729.2 --> 1734.32
with the whole presidential situation in

1731.36 --> 1734.32
the united states

1736.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
2030 okay

1741.12 --> 1744.9599999999998
all right but there is still this

1743.039 --> 1747.52
remaining option or

1744.96 --> 1750.32
hopefully not a false hope that

1747.52 --> 1751.52
trump is basically letting this all

1750.32 --> 1753.84
kind of like

1751.52 --> 1753.84
roll

1754.799 --> 1760.08
like giving them a false victory in

1756.88 --> 1762.24
order to then at the end have yeah like

1760.08 --> 1763.279
a fishing net and gathering all the

1762.24 --> 1765.44
evidence

1763.279 --> 1768.559
but that's a hope there's no guarantee

1765.44 --> 1768.559
you'll actually do it

1771.279 --> 1777.399
there would be consequences and rolling

1773.52 --> 1777.399
one way or the other

1781.84 --> 1787.48
hello nathan oakley by the way

1784.0 --> 1787.48
good to see you

1790.25 --> 1793.38
[Music]

1798.24 --> 1801.84
well more colored

1799.919 --> 1804.24
look when people get arrested during a

1801.84 --> 1807.12
protest when they don't yeah

1804.24 --> 1809.919
overtly cove commit

1807.12 --> 1812.08
violence in some way

1809.919 --> 1813.8400000000001
they're not gonna say they were arrested

1812.08 --> 1816.8799999999999
for peacefully protesting they're gonna

1813.84 --> 1819.4399999999998
make up an excuse

1816.88 --> 1821.6000000000001
some things that they did or whatever

1819.44 --> 1824.96
something they said

1821.6 --> 1826.24
if through policy they will find some

1824.96 --> 1828.3990000000001
way to

1826.24 --> 1830.159
get somebody off the street if they

1828.399 --> 1832.6399999999999
thought it was necessary that's kind of

1830.159 --> 1835.7600000000002
what it's become

1832.64 --> 1837.279
it's just a policy bureaucracy

1835.76 --> 1839.36
so it's really up to the police

1837.279 --> 1841.52
themselves whether they are willing to

1839.36 --> 1843.6
actually do that

1841.52 --> 1846.1589999999999
abuse that

1843.6 --> 1846.1589999999999
policy

1849.36 --> 1857.7199999999998
did you watch the trice eight jeremy's

1852.64 --> 1857.72
video on the election no i did not

1872.559 --> 1876.72
that might be true imagination with

1874.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
fantasy it's interchangeable but not

1876.72 --> 1879.84
completely though

1880.159 --> 1885.2
because imagination

1882.72 --> 1888.0
is really more the tool

1885.2 --> 1888.0
that does it

1889.36 --> 1895.039
it's the tool

1891.039 --> 1896.799
and it can fantasize it can also just

1895.039 --> 1898.64
plan

1896.799 --> 1902.519
so there's more than just fantasy that

1898.64 --> 1902.519
can happen in the imagination

1909.44 --> 1914.0
imagination is this escape from reality

1912.24 --> 1916.159
no no that's

1914.0 --> 1919.519
that's a wrongful application of the

1916.159 --> 1921.7600000000002
word imagination that's actually fantasy

1919.519 --> 1926.159
fantasy is the escape for reality

1921.76 --> 1926.1589999999999
imagination is not imagination is a tool

1931.519 --> 1935.44
but you can use that tool to escape from

1934.24 --> 1938.559
reality

1935.44 --> 1940.799
and that usually entails fantasy

1938.559 --> 1943.279
but it doesn't make it all imagination

1940.799 --> 1945.2
and escape from reality in a direct

1943.279 --> 1947.76
sense

1945.2 --> 1950.559
it's also used to actually gain a better

1947.76 --> 1953.279
grip on reality

1950.559 --> 1954.1589999999999
through learning

1953.279 --> 1959.0
so

1954.159 --> 1959.0
see what i mean it's not the same scale

1976.08 --> 1981.4399999999998
right fantasy plus math is model or the

1979.039 --> 1983.519
globe model definitely and the fantasy

1981.44 --> 1985.76
part is the presuppositions

1983.519 --> 1988.3990000000001
and then bypassing on the disproof of

1985.76 --> 1991.519
those presuppositions

1988.399 --> 1993.6
and then it becomes fantasy resting on

1991.519 --> 1995.919
mathematical structures based on an

1993.6 --> 1999.279
offset that has already been disproven

1995.919 --> 2002.279
but that part is being ignored

1999.279 --> 2002.279
yes

2004.72 --> 2007.72
ugh

2023.76 --> 2026.76
so

2035.039 --> 2038.039
so

2047.679 --> 2050.679
goodie

2058.15 --> 2061.1890000000003
[Music]

2066.079 --> 2068.3990000000003
right

2069.599 --> 2075.44
yeah let me give an example about that

2071.76 --> 2077.0400000000004
the difference again between imagination

2075.44 --> 2078.32
and fantasy

2077.04 --> 2081.04
so

2078.32 --> 2082.079
something very basic in planning for

2081.04 --> 2083.04
example

2082.079 --> 2085.76
okay

2083.04 --> 2087.679
i plan to go to the grocery store after

2085.76 --> 2090.2400000000002
the show

2087.679 --> 2092.56
right i plan this so i can think about

2090.24 --> 2094.1589999999997
that in my mind and then visualize me on

2092.56 --> 2096.0789999999997
the bike

2094.159 --> 2098.48
doing that how long is it going to take

2096.079 --> 2100.6400000000003
how cold is it going to get

2098.48 --> 2103.28
and i'm considering all these things

2100.64 --> 2106.16
virtually now if i would suddenly think

2103.28 --> 2108.079
whoa dude

2106.16 --> 2110.56
what if suddenly

2108.079 --> 2113.119
i somehow knew how to levitate and

2110.56 --> 2116.56
basically like

2113.119 --> 2118.96
lift my bike off and then fly over the

2116.56 --> 2121.52
city in a straight line and then just

2118.96 --> 2124.56
land right next to the grocery store

2121.52 --> 2126.4
holy [ __ ] i can visualize that it's

2124.56 --> 2127.52
pretty amazing

2126.4 --> 2129.599
right

2127.52 --> 2131.28
now that's fantasy

2129.599 --> 2132.96
because i'm pretty sure that's not going

2131.28 --> 2135.2000000000003
to happen

2132.96 --> 2135.2
see

2136.24 --> 2140.64
but up until that point where i

2138.32 --> 2142.079
introduced the fictional element that

2140.64 --> 2144.4
i'm pretty sure is not going to happen

2142.079 --> 2146.96
in physical reality up until that point

2144.4 --> 2149.839
it was not fantasy

2146.96 --> 2149.839
it was just me

2150.64 --> 2156.0
looking ahead using my imagination

2154.24 --> 2159.359
to kind of

2156.0 --> 2161.76
lay a spiritual pre-railroad

2159.359 --> 2164.24
for my conscience to latch onto when i

2161.76 --> 2168.6800000000003
engage in the physical world

2164.24 --> 2168.68
into that plan that action

2171.59 --> 2174.789
[Music]

2175.44 --> 2180.2400000000002
i don't know academic definition

2177.92 --> 2180.2400000000002
guys

2180.32 --> 2184.8
i don't even know if i got all the

2182.079 --> 2186.7200000000003
technicalities completely right but i do

2184.8 --> 2188.7200000000003
it like this and i always have there's

2186.72 --> 2190.72
to me just a big difference between the

2188.72 --> 2193.839
imagination and fantasy and it's kind of

2190.72 --> 2196.56
been mixed together for a lot of people

2193.839 --> 2200.2
oversimplified

2196.56 --> 2200.2
it's not too we

2200.32 --> 2205.119
so i don't know if the the words that

2203.28 --> 2206.88
i've used for

2205.119 --> 2208.56
my arguments here are

2206.88 --> 2210.4
absolutely

2208.56 --> 2211.92
correct

2210.4 --> 2214.7200000000003
on a

2211.92 --> 2216.32
dictionary level to that

2214.72 --> 2219.9199999999996
but my case

2216.32 --> 2220.96
that i make with them is pretty solid

2219.92 --> 2222.16
i hope

2220.96 --> 2224.64
you can

2222.16 --> 2224.64
see that

2225.599 --> 2232.1600000000003
but i might be completely right though

2228.8 --> 2235.2000000000003
i literally did not look it up just

2232.16 --> 2235.2
just now or anything

2238.96 --> 2241.28
right

2241.68 --> 2245.7599999999998
right well fantasy is delusion

2249.68 --> 2254.96
but people have fantasies all the time

2251.76 --> 2257.0400000000004
it's only when they act

2254.96 --> 2259.599
on that fantasy

2257.04 --> 2261.7599999999998
that the delusion that it's really

2259.599 --> 2263.119
designated as delusion it's only when

2261.76 --> 2266.88
acted upon

2263.119 --> 2269.2000000000003
that it becomes designated as a delusion

2266.88 --> 2271.599
because people have crazy ideas and

2269.2 --> 2274.0789999999997
things they feel and then imagine all

2271.599 --> 2274.079
the time

2274.8 --> 2278.1600000000003
that's kind of normal it's when they

2276.4 --> 2280.7200000000003
start to act

2278.16 --> 2285.64
through magical thinking though

2280.72 --> 2285.64
that it becomes effectively delusional

2294.079 --> 2298.1600000000003
i did fantasy synonym of imagination

2296.24 --> 2300.72
well i've done that too all over the

2298.16 --> 2302.16
place because it rolls easy it's like

2300.72 --> 2305.2
that

2302.16 --> 2307.92
that other way of utilizing language

2305.2 --> 2309.04
when everything is mixed in more

2307.92 --> 2311.04
then yeah

2309.04 --> 2313.599
people will still get it

2311.04 --> 2315.119
until you get really complex and

2313.599 --> 2317.599
specific and then certainly it's going

2315.119 --> 2319.6800000000003
to be very confusing that they are

2317.599 --> 2322.6800000000003
generally used as synonyms see what i

2319.68 --> 2322.68
mean

2338.32 --> 2343.2000000000003
colloquial uses of the words ruin their

2340.56 --> 2345.44
actual meanings yes

2343.2 --> 2345.4399999999996
well

2346.48 --> 2351.52
wisdom

2348.56 --> 2353.359
things tools

2351.52 --> 2356.16
dilapidate

2353.359 --> 2358.0789999999997
due to a lack of understanding

2356.16 --> 2360.24
people are handed tools and they don't

2358.079 --> 2363.599
know how to use it then they will find a

2360.24 --> 2364.56
more basic way to use it eventually

2363.599 --> 2366.8
and then

2364.56 --> 2369.2799999999997
the original ways are forgotten if

2366.8 --> 2372.1600000000003
nobody is left to demonstrate how they

2369.28 --> 2374.5600000000004
are actually supposed to be used see

2372.16 --> 2377.04
that's also ties in what i explained

2374.56 --> 2378.96
about iconography

2377.04 --> 2380.96
and ancient religious knowledge you know

2378.96 --> 2382.64
that

2380.96 --> 2385.92
of which i'm pretty sure the founders

2382.64 --> 2387.92
were absolutely brilliant transcended

2385.92 --> 2390.16
some of them at least

2387.92 --> 2393.2000000000003
devised all that

2390.16 --> 2397.1189999999997
envisioned it as they would call that

2393.2 --> 2400.3999999999996
and then it was done

2397.119 --> 2401.28
and it had massive depths

2400.4 --> 2404.0
which

2401.28 --> 2406.1600000000003
have all fallen into forgottenfulness

2404.0 --> 2407.76
and now it's just mysterious and like

2406.16 --> 2409.5989999999997
you can feel with some ancient things

2407.76 --> 2411.599
like well there is something to it i

2409.599 --> 2413.52
can't pinpoint it and then you

2411.599 --> 2417.44
go back to little details which your

2413.52 --> 2419.28
mind can sort of latch onto

2417.44 --> 2420.56
and it goes further and further and

2419.28 --> 2422.8
further

2420.56 --> 2424.56
and then people basically study these

2422.8 --> 2426.88
sort of things for like 40 years or

2424.56 --> 2429.52
their entire lives end up saying like

2426.88 --> 2431.6800000000003
yeah this it's crazy man

2429.52 --> 2434.16
i've done this all my life and every

2431.68 --> 2435.7599999999998
time you think you've learned it all

2434.16 --> 2437.44
there's something new you didn't

2435.76 --> 2439.0400000000004
consider before and that gives

2437.44 --> 2440.64
everything a completely different

2439.04 --> 2443.44
perspective and it turns out like

2440.64 --> 2447.2
there's like infinite meaning and that's

2443.44 --> 2447.2000000000003
eventually where people end up with

2448.8 --> 2453.0
because it is all in there

2453.359 --> 2457.839
and that's also a big part why we should

2455.359 --> 2460.96
not destroy

2457.839 --> 2464.599
what we do not understand

2460.96 --> 2464.599
even with objects

2478.88 --> 2483.28
intelligence does not result in wisdom

2484.24 --> 2486.7999999999997
true

2488.8 --> 2492.48
but

2490.24 --> 2494.319
it does kind of make it inevitable

2492.48 --> 2497.04
though

2494.319 --> 2500.48
you see wisdom

2497.04 --> 2504.0
that what is recognized as wisdom is

2500.48 --> 2505.359
when you actually surrender to it and

2504.0 --> 2506.96
apply it

2505.359 --> 2509.119
now that doesn't mean that people don't

2506.96 --> 2511.92
gather wisdom it's just that sometimes

2509.119 --> 2514.079
they get caught up in spells or demons

2511.92 --> 2517.28
and they refuse to apply it even though

2514.079 --> 2519.44
they have it they just don't apply it

2517.28 --> 2521.28
it's how old people can get very stuck

2519.44 --> 2522.7200000000003
in their ways

2521.28 --> 2525.44
they still have the wisdom they just

2522.72 --> 2528.0789999999997
can't reach it

2525.44 --> 2530.079
because there's they're trapped

2528.079 --> 2532.6400000000003
they can't bear the consequences of

2530.079 --> 2535.6200000000003
being untrapped or they simply don't

2532.64 --> 2541.7599999999998
know how to get out by themselves

2535.62 --> 2545.2
[Music]

2541.76 --> 2545.2000000000003
because wisdom is

2546.72 --> 2553.52
it's a it's very useful

2549.52 --> 2555.52
but it's also the consolidation price

2553.52 --> 2556.72
for basically

2555.52 --> 2560.7599999999998
suffering

2556.72 --> 2560.7599999999998
that's a big part of growing

2569.56 --> 2572.659
[Music]

2576.319 --> 2580.8
what is the topic nothing specific

2578.64 --> 2583.7599999999998
a lot of psychology talk today in

2580.8 --> 2583.76
esoterics again

2586.319 --> 2589.68
and

2587.2 --> 2591.359
was addressed about fantasy

2589.68 --> 2593.839
the difference between fantasy and

2591.359 --> 2593.839
imagination

2596.96 --> 2602.68
a good servant

2598.48 --> 2602.68
yeah martin tolberg of course

2613.1 --> 2616.17
[Music]

2621.359 --> 2626.319
wisdom is the application of knowledge

2624.079 --> 2626.319
no

2628.72 --> 2632.839
or

2629.68 --> 2635.04
ah that's almost like a trick

2632.839 --> 2636.96
statement because a lot of wisdom is

2635.04 --> 2640.0
based on actually not

2636.96 --> 2640.0
applying things

2640.079 --> 2643.52
especially the more you learn

2643.76 --> 2649.1600000000003
just because you know how to do

2645.119 --> 2649.1600000000003
something doesn't mean you should

2656.16 --> 2660.839
that's also a big part of learning about

2657.92 --> 2665.6800000000003
mistakes is learning

2660.839 --> 2668.0789999999997
why what was wrong and how to avoid that

2665.68 --> 2670.64
by realizing why that happened and

2668.079 --> 2670.6400000000003
everything and

2674.64 --> 2679.359
dude i see your comment below above yeah

2677.28 --> 2680.88
i think so vegan bear

2679.359 --> 2684.72
all right yeah

2680.88 --> 2687.7200000000003
why am i drinking tea what is that

2684.72 --> 2687.72
dude

2692.96 --> 2697.44
i'm always drinking tea unless i'm out

2695.04 --> 2697.44
of tea

2699.28 --> 2703.28
like since the very first early bird

2701.76 --> 2705.92
show

2703.28 --> 2710.8390000000004
that's why i say green tea as always

2705.92 --> 2710.839
because it is as always come on

2719.04 --> 2724.48
when i know better i do better

2721.599 --> 2724.48
or why is that

2725.76 --> 2730.3190000000004
isn't that

2727.119 --> 2732.7200000000003
more to the confidence

2730.319 --> 2734.8
that the knowledge

2732.72 --> 2736.8799999999997
inspired

2734.8 --> 2740.4
that you had more certainty of grip over

2736.88 --> 2741.92
the situation and so that confidence

2740.4 --> 2743.92
then

2741.92 --> 2746.319
infused you like uh

2743.92 --> 2749.2000000000003
imbued you

2746.319 --> 2750.88
like a strength to make to actually

2749.2 --> 2753.04
manifest it

2750.88 --> 2755.119
better

2753.04 --> 2756.88
so did the knowledge do that or did the

2755.119 --> 2759.8
confidence bringing forth from the

2756.88 --> 2766.7090000000003
knowledge to that

2759.8 --> 2766.7090000000003
[Music]

2770.72 --> 2776.3999999999996
yes i am an aquarius that's right

2773.599 --> 2776.4
take the horizon

2783.359 --> 2787.96
oh let's just wisdom is true now

2793.359 --> 2798.56
now wisdom is a

2795.2 --> 2798.56
is a spirit process

2799.359 --> 2804.4
but true knowledge is based on truth

2803.52 --> 2807.68
like

2804.4 --> 2809.599
even knowledge about deception is

2807.68 --> 2812.72
knowing

2809.599 --> 2816.599
the truth about the deception

2812.72 --> 2816.5989999999997
and then it becomes knowledge

2818.48 --> 2823.119
but wisdom is personal it's

2821.2 --> 2824.8799999999997
it's the spirits it's a conscious

2823.119 --> 2829.8
reflection

2824.88 --> 2829.8
of it all that's a separate thing

2835.119 --> 2838.119
so

2849.44 --> 2852.839
with dome

2862.48 --> 2868.16
it's interesting

2894.48 --> 2896.8
hmm

2896.96 --> 2903.28
that's interesting

2899.68 --> 2903.2799999999997
you know what it actually means

2903.92 --> 2906.7200000000003
freedom

2905.599 --> 2910.0
dom

2906.72 --> 2910.0
is basically

2913.92 --> 2919.04
forming nouns denoting a state or

2916.4 --> 2919.04
condition

2922.64 --> 2925.68
status

2923.839 --> 2928.72
domain

2925.68 --> 2932.0
so it's a dom is condition status or

2928.72 --> 2934.64
rank status or domain that's basic so it

2932.0 --> 2934.64
is like wiz

2934.8 --> 2938.48
knowledge

2936.4 --> 2940.7200000000003
your knowledge domain it's the

2938.48 --> 2942.4
preponderance of your knowledge i guess

2940.72 --> 2944.64
that's sort of what it points at and

2942.4 --> 2947.28
that makes sense

2944.64 --> 2949.839
it's not the knowledge separately no

2947.28 --> 2952.6400000000003
it's the preponderance the domain of

2949.839 --> 2952.64
your knowledge

2953.92 --> 2957.2400000000002
that's interesting

2957.599 --> 2961.04
it's not a dome

2959.68 --> 2964.04
take the horizon this is wishful

2961.04 --> 2964.04
thinking

2981.52 --> 2985.839
application of no no no that's not

2987.28 --> 2991.6800000000003
that that's not what that means it is

2989.599 --> 2995.04
the preponderance of knowledge it's what

2991.68 --> 2995.04
you've the totality

2996.319 --> 3003.119
so it's not knowledge separately nor the

2999.359 --> 3003.119
designation of application

3011.04 --> 3017.5589999999997
discipline is that freedom i'll check

for years

3069.92 --> 3073.28
on a daily basis

3071.599 --> 3074.88
i was like this word what does it

3073.28 --> 3076.48
actually mean let's look it up well they

3074.88 --> 3081.1600000000003
didn't have internet but we did have

3076.48 --> 3081.16
like a giant pile of encyclopedia

3081.44 --> 3084.16
so

3082.559 --> 3087.76
and dictionaries

3084.16 --> 3091.16
including etymological dictionaries

3087.76 --> 3091.1600000000003
pretty good ones

3099.04 --> 3106.369
um

3101.66 --> 3106.3689999999997
[Music]

3118.16 --> 3122.24
the totality well it's that that now the

3120.48 --> 3125.52
preponderance

3122.24 --> 3126.72
in a form of totality is specifically to

3125.52 --> 3131.119
a person

3126.72 --> 3131.1189999999997
in the moment because wisdom does grow

3131.44 --> 3136.16
it's not the preponderance of all the

3133.839 --> 3138.96
knowledge that has ever existed or

3136.16 --> 3142.5989999999997
attained by humanity

3138.96 --> 3142.599
it's person specific

3162.8 --> 3165.8
hmm

3174.4 --> 3179.44
right that's a that's a a good way or

3177.76 --> 3182.7200000000003
that's maybe the official definition

3179.44 --> 3182.7200000000003
george sanford but yes

3182.8 --> 3185.3590000000004
it's not

3185.92 --> 3191.6800000000003
it's about the decisions and judgments

3189.119 --> 3194.6800000000003
it's not about application

3191.68 --> 3194.68
see

3195.04 --> 3202.359
it's all about reflections and decisions

3199.359 --> 3202.359
judgment

3218.96 --> 3223.4
sun came out looks nice

3242.51 --> 3245.639
[Music]

3247.359 --> 3250.88
that's a nice picture like that

3297.44 --> 3301.68
the action of putting something into

3299.119 --> 3304.2400000000002
operation

3301.68 --> 3304.24
i don't know

3305.359 --> 3306.64
it's maybe

3305.76 --> 3308.96
course

3306.64 --> 3308.96
yeah

3309.2 --> 3313.2799999999997
i'm not going to

3310.64 --> 3316.8799999999997
like ingrain that

3313.28 --> 3319.44
wisdom is not necessarily

3316.88 --> 3322.4
oh it's tough yeah i guess if you by

3319.44 --> 3323.92
application you mean

3322.4 --> 3327.04
using it

3323.92 --> 3328.0
in a process of thinking

3327.04 --> 3330.319
then

3328.0 --> 3330.319
yes

3333.04 --> 3337.839
i'd rather call it the utilization

3335.839 --> 3341.119
because the application

3337.839 --> 3343.52
emphasizes really that

3341.119 --> 3346.52
like something that's going to manifest

3343.52 --> 3346.52
physically

3348.64 --> 3355.5589999999997
a physical alteration as the result

3352.24 --> 3355.5589999999997
i don't know

3385.359 --> 3388.64
into operation

3389.76 --> 3393.0400000000004
it's the same dilemma

3398.48 --> 3403.599
unless yeah unless you're designated to

3400.96 --> 3407.599
specifically your own

3403.599 --> 3407.599
mental processes and thinking

3408.48 --> 3413.44
that operation

3410.72 --> 3417.04
and that as a as an application

3413.44 --> 3420.38
designation yeah then it makes sense

3417.04 --> 3423.469
ah anyway enough about that word

3420.38 --> 3423.469
[Music]

3462.0 --> 3465.52
easier to be an atheist

3471.44 --> 3475.64
yeah makes sense more colored

3484.24 --> 3489.7599999999998
yeah you know what what really kind of

3486.48 --> 3493.68
turned me into an atheist is

3489.76 --> 3496.7990000000004
when i was a little kid and it was smart

3493.68 --> 3498.799
and it was very eager to express that to

3496.799 --> 3502.799
like gain

3498.799 --> 3504.559
recognition from everyone around me

3502.799 --> 3507.04
because i didn't feel that great about

3504.559 --> 3508.079
myself very felt very vulnerable in many

3507.04 --> 3510.24
ways

3508.079 --> 3513.28
but also like strong

3510.24 --> 3513.2799999999997
brave and all that

3513.76 --> 3517.2000000000003
but yeah

3515.359 --> 3519.52
after a point

3517.2 --> 3522.319
people started to really like push on me

3519.52 --> 3525.119
like yeah you are

3522.319 --> 3528.16
smart you have a responsibility towards

3525.119 --> 3529.76
the world and all that

3528.16 --> 3533.44
and that

3529.76 --> 3535.44
in ways also really pushed me

3533.44 --> 3536.2400000000002
like no

3535.44 --> 3538.48
like

3536.24 --> 3539.9199999999996
this is my intelligence

3538.48 --> 3540.96
it's mine

3539.92 --> 3542.559
i'm

3540.96 --> 3545.119
i was born with that i can do with it

3542.559 --> 3546.079
whenever i like that was kind of also a

3545.119 --> 3549.52
bit of a

3546.079 --> 3552.0
i guess juvenile problem

3549.52 --> 3554.24
and then atheism plays into that great

3552.0 --> 3558.28
because it is like all random so you can

3554.24 --> 3558.2799999999997
think of it whatever you like

3560.88 --> 3565.2000000000003
so if i would just get too pressured

3563.119 --> 3566.559
from that then i would

3565.2 --> 3568.5589999999997
deflect

3566.559 --> 3572.44
arguments eventually

3568.559 --> 3572.44
from an atheist perspective

3574.4 --> 3579.52
i'm talking about what yeah one is a kid

3576.319 --> 3579.52
and a teenager and all that

3580.72 --> 3584.52
no that's not true

3587.119 --> 3593.599
an atheist purpose is the purpose that

3589.359 --> 3593.5989999999997
they manage to make for themselves

3593.76 --> 3596.96
now that purpose if it's not routed

3595.599 --> 3598.96
their logos

3596.96 --> 3601.599
is not really going to stand the test

3598.96 --> 3604.7200000000003
the time and then yeah it's still all

3601.599 --> 3606.48
happening how yeah how it happens

3604.72 --> 3609.1189999999997
even if you are stuck in an atheist

3606.48 --> 3609.119
perspective

3610.079 --> 3613.6800000000003
but the purpose you have to find it

3612.559 --> 3616.079
yourself

3613.68 --> 3621.0
that's kind of what

3616.079 --> 3621.0
atheist and atheism yields

3646.079 --> 3650.079
it's all over simplification

3655.359 --> 3660.5589999999997
look all these things are suggested by

3658.079 --> 3661.76
some individuals all your own god and

3660.559 --> 3662.559
all that

3661.76 --> 3665.119
but

3662.559 --> 3668.88
that's up to the individual

3665.119 --> 3672.799
how much they let themselves go

3668.88 --> 3672.799
using atheism as an excuse

3675.68 --> 3679.7599999999998
and that will over time

3677.92 --> 3682.16
make them nasty but that doesn't mean

3679.76 --> 3683.28
that all atheists are per definition

3682.16 --> 3686.319
nasty

3683.28 --> 3686.3190000000004
it's just not true

3687.359 --> 3691.7599999999998
sometimes their mind is atheists but

3689.68 --> 3693.359
their heart knows

3691.76 --> 3696.2400000000002
and they still want to do the right

3693.359 --> 3698.16
thing they just can't handle it mentally

3696.24 --> 3700.4799999999996
and they use atheism thinking as a

3698.16 --> 3703.44
fallback excuse position

3700.48 --> 3705.44
their hearts still know deep inside it's

3703.44 --> 3708.7200000000003
just they can't really allow it to let

3705.44 --> 3708.7200000000003
it in there mentally

3709.04 --> 3713.52
but they will recognize situations for

3711.76 --> 3716.079
what they are when they happen

3713.52 --> 3717.52
subconsciously

3716.079 --> 3719.039
so

3717.52 --> 3720.48
yeah it all

3719.039 --> 3723.8390000000004
depends on

3720.48 --> 3725.76
how much atheists in their mindset will

3723.839 --> 3727.2799999999997
be seduced to

3725.76 --> 3729.2000000000003
sin and to

3734.319 --> 3738.16
how much they are seduced from the

delusional position that everything is

3738.16 --> 3741.16
allowed

3748.16 --> 3752.72
atheists have a lot of faith in

3749.52 --> 3754.559
themselves not necessarily vegan bear

3752.72 --> 3756.9599999999996
that has nothing to do

3754.559 --> 3756.96
with it

3759.599 --> 3765.3590000000004
they're very confident atheists and

3761.68 --> 3771.0
they're also very in confident and lost

3765.359 --> 3771.0
and miserable atheist so does just no

3801.599 --> 3806.1600000000003
what do they have faith in them well

3803.359 --> 3807.3199999999997
that all depends on where they're where

3806.16 --> 3809.1189999999997
they're dwelling

[Music]

3809.119 --> 3815.6800000000003
what stories have they attained as being

3811.68 --> 3817.44
the most likely truth to themselves

3815.68 --> 3819.68
because they eventually start to just

3817.44 --> 3820.96
fabricate it from scratch from their own

3819.68 --> 3823.1189999999997
perspective

3820.96 --> 3825.839
it's kind of what i have done

3823.119 --> 3825.839
in my own way

3826.88 --> 3829.839
most of my life

3831.119 --> 3836.559
kind of back engineer things

3834.16 --> 3838.72
but yeah eventually i realized like wait

3836.559 --> 3839.6800000000003
this thing that i'm back engineering

3838.72 --> 3842.8799999999997
seems

3839.68 --> 3842.8799999999997
very familiar

3843.44 --> 3850.96
and then i realized oh [ __ ]

3846.72 --> 3853.68
i was only just hiding

3850.96 --> 3855.839
mentally because i couldn't handle the

3853.68 --> 3858.3999999999996
thing that i have been reconstructing is

3855.839 --> 3861.64
actually the thing that was there

3858.4 --> 3861.64
all along

3872.88 --> 3875.88
so

3886.799 --> 3889.7599999999998
trust the plan

3890.24 --> 3893.359
all right

3891.44 --> 3896.96
well a lot of

3893.359 --> 3899.839
atheists do end up trusting in man

3896.96 --> 3902.319
that's usually what happens

3899.839 --> 3905.319
who's gonna be the arbiter of the truth

intelligence and the act do act superior

3960.4 --> 3965.839
because also big part and this was even

3962.88 --> 3969.119
an issue with myself it's just

3965.839 --> 3971.599
that for some people humility

3969.119 --> 3974.1600000000003
just doesn't

3971.599 --> 3975.92
it like sort of doesn't ring true

3974.16 --> 3978.5589999999997
to them

3975.92 --> 3982.7200000000003
from a dwelling perspective and then

3978.559 --> 3984.0
like christian you very

3982.72 --> 3985.5989999999997
modest

3984.0 --> 3987.98
like say uh

3985.599 --> 3989.839
what's it called again

3987.98 --> 3991.44
[Music]

3989.839 --> 3992.799
the amish

3991.44 --> 3995.119
they're like looking at it it's like

3992.799 --> 3997.599
what is this why why are you doing

3995.119 --> 3998.88
that's ridiculous why don't you use

3997.599 --> 4000.7200000000003
everything

3998.88 --> 4002.559
because they don't understand they

4000.72 --> 4004.72
literally don't understand because they

4002.559 --> 4006.3190000000004
think that it's everything is exactly as

4004.72 --> 4007.4399999999996
it should be and it's inevitable and

4006.319 --> 4009.92
it's good

4007.44 --> 4011.92
the developments they don't realize all

4009.92 --> 4013.92
the backdrop

4011.92 --> 4015.839
engineering that's happening in the long

4013.92 --> 4018.319
term purpose that

4015.839 --> 4020.4
are actually at play

4018.319 --> 4022.64
they don't get that and then just is

4020.4 --> 4025.039
this humility like why are they not

4022.64 --> 4027.2799999999997
doing anything why aren't they

4025.039 --> 4029.76
getting in here and then help building

4027.28 --> 4032.8390000000004
it to make it good

4029.76 --> 4038.0
and that was also a big part of my

4032.839 --> 4038.0
feelings during that that entire period

4038.16 --> 4041.52
like i

4039.359 --> 4045.0389999999998
i did not respect christians because i

4041.52 --> 4045.0389999999998
did not understand it

4045.52 --> 4052.24
i did not understand why

4048.799 --> 4052.24
why are you not

4052.88 --> 4060.599
getting with the times and

4055.359 --> 4060.5989999999997
trying to find a new way like that

4062.4 --> 4067.119
and now after

4064.96 --> 4069.68
half a lifetime

4067.119 --> 4072.7200000000003
i'm like okay

4069.68 --> 4074.16
i wish i would have seen that before and

4072.72 --> 4076.72
accepted it

4074.16 --> 4077.7599999999998
but on the other hand yeah i've learned

4076.72 --> 4078.64
a lot

4077.76 --> 4079.76
from

4078.64 --> 4081.92
that

4079.76 --> 4083.44
mistaken assumption

4081.92 --> 4086.2400000000002
and now i'm

4083.44 --> 4089.88
sort of like in my mind trying to figure

4086.24 --> 4089.8799999999997
out how can i

4090.64 --> 4094.96
let

4092.48 --> 4099.199
as many of the mistakes as i've engaged

4094.96 --> 4102.0
in go and miss assumptions and kind of

4099.199 --> 4105.919999999999
try to get what i originally missed out

4102.0 --> 4105.92
on because i didn't understand it

what

4180.96 --> 4188.12
that's ridiculous

4184.0 --> 4188.12
that's absolutely ridiculous

4190.56 --> 4193.56
so

4229.76 --> 4234.400000000001
dude if people would say that to me

4232.56 --> 4238.0
now maybe if their family it's different

4234.4 --> 4238.0
but i tell them like yeah

4238.239 --> 4243.12
the way you're thinking right now you're

4240.48 --> 4244.959999999999
not gonna make it past the winter

4243.12 --> 4245.92
would say something like that it's just

4244.96 --> 4247.679
like

4245.92 --> 4248.88
can't be serious

4247.679 --> 4251.76
it's like

4248.88 --> 4255.12
you want to die

4251.76 --> 4255.12
just surrendering

4255.76 --> 4262.56
how can people allow themselves to be

4259.44 --> 4264.5599999999995
that stupid

4262.56 --> 4266.96
is it really just

4264.56 --> 4269.04
that they're actually too sick of life

4266.96 --> 4272.92
to deal with it anymore so they just go

4269.04 --> 4272.92
on that total autopilot

4273.12 --> 4277.76
and let whatever happens happen

4275.36 --> 4279.92
isn't that it is that what does that i

4277.76 --> 4283.64
just don't get it

4279.92 --> 4283.64
when people do that

4286.6 --> 4289.729
[Music]

4332.48 --> 4337.12
i'm just wondering like if there's if

4334.64 --> 4339.52
there's plenty of people that are stuck

4337.12 --> 4341.44
in that sort of thing how

4339.52 --> 4343.6
how much more pressure will it take

4341.44 --> 4347.28
before people are literally going to

4343.6 --> 4349.360000000001
have giant psychotic snaps

4347.28 --> 4354.08
when they've pushed it so far the

4349.36 --> 4357.04
doubling down so far that literally

4354.08 --> 4359.44
just that little extra piece of paranoia

4357.04 --> 4361.76
is literally just gonna make them snap

4359.44 --> 4364.4
and just go in their car hit the gas

4361.76 --> 4364.400000000001
pedal and just

4364.719 --> 4368.0
run into a tree or that sort of [ __ ] you

4366.96 --> 4370.8
know

4368.0 --> 4374.64
that's what i thinking like how

4370.8 --> 4377.12
far can you double down before you just

4374.64 --> 4377.12
snap

4382.4 --> 4385.4
damn

4389.36 --> 4395.759999999999
oh maybe you should stop doubling down

4391.6 --> 4396.719
like a [ __ ] [ __ ] how about that

4395.76 --> 4398.88
yeah

4396.719 --> 4401.84
at this point guys

4398.88 --> 4404.8
like how can you have mercy for people

4401.84 --> 4407.84
that literally

4404.8 --> 4411.6
it's not that it makes me happy it's

4407.84 --> 4411.6
just like come on

4411.679 --> 4415.52
there's literally people and even family

4414.159 --> 4417.04
members like

4415.52 --> 4419.52
desperately

4417.04 --> 4420.56
loudly trying to get through you at

4419.52 --> 4422.400000000001
times

4420.56 --> 4425.52
how can you

4422.4 --> 4428.879999999999
double down against everything

4425.52 --> 4431.84
fully feeling where that's gonna go

4428.88 --> 4431.84
it's like

4432.0 --> 4439.8
it's almost like a

4434.48 --> 4439.799999999999
decided slow suicide at that point

4445.52 --> 4449.1990000000005
or you could just freaking snap out of

4447.76 --> 4452.719
it

4449.199 --> 4454.4
then let let the hell rage unleash which

4452.719 --> 4458.159
will happen not

4454.4 --> 4460.96
does it it's going to happen

4458.159 --> 4463.44
it's going to happen if you die doubling

4460.96 --> 4465.36
down it's going to happen it's going to

4463.44 --> 4466.839999999999
happen it's going to happen there is

nothing

4466.84 --> 4474.96
ever that you can do

4469.76 --> 4474.96
to prevent the pain from reaching you

4475.679 --> 4483.52
you can never escape

4478.8 --> 4485.84
never you must realize it if you don't

4483.52 --> 4488.64
in your life then you will in death and

4485.84 --> 4492.64
you will still feel the pain that you're

4488.64 --> 4494.400000000001
trying to escape there is no escape

4492.64 --> 4498.2390000000005
the confrontation

4494.4 --> 4498.239
cannot be escaped

4500.0 --> 4505.6
the world is freaky and media is

4503.12 --> 4507.28
basically casting giant spells of

4505.6 --> 4510.08
paranoid

4507.28 --> 4513.12
lies on people

4510.08 --> 4514.88
and even your own

4513.12 --> 4518.5599999999995
insane death

4514.88 --> 4521.92
will not prevent you from facing the

4518.56 --> 4523.120000000001
pain of that realization even after

4521.92 --> 4525.84
death

4523.12 --> 4530.84
so i'm just telling you

4525.84 --> 4530.84
you must snap out of it

4538.15 --> 4542.349999999999
[Music]

4545.95 --> 4550.1089999999995
[Music]

4554.96 --> 4558.96
you must snap out

4557.6 --> 4561.6
the fact

4558.96 --> 4564.0
that if you're caught up in these weird

4561.6 --> 4566.320000000001
paranoid fantasy

4564.0 --> 4569.84
things and building it yourself making

4566.32 --> 4569.84
your own corona measures

4570.0 --> 4576.96
that it's literally nothing you're being

4573.04 --> 4579.199
preoccupied by pure fiction

4576.96 --> 4580.8
it's almost like you read a book about

4579.199 --> 4582.799999999999
something that's

4580.8 --> 4584.4800000000005
obviously a science fiction book and

4582.8 --> 4586.56
then you believe

4584.48 --> 4589.44
that what it is talking about is a

4586.56 --> 4591.360000000001
hundred percent real right now in your

4589.44 --> 4595.839999999999
life and you're acting on it that's

4591.36 --> 4595.839999999999
basically what you guys are caught up in

4596.4 --> 4598.32
let

4597.36 --> 4602.719
it

4598.32 --> 4603.92
go and face the fact what the world has

4602.719 --> 4606.08
become

4603.92 --> 4609.84
you cannot undo it

4606.08 --> 4612.8
it is true you cannot undo what the

4609.84 --> 4615.679
world has become you must face it and

4612.8 --> 4617.28
you will face it

4615.679 --> 4620.159
one way or the other

4617.28 --> 4623.84
even after death you will face it and

4620.159 --> 4623.839999999999
you will feel the pain of it

4624.0 --> 4626.64
so just

4625.36 --> 4630.4
do it

4626.64 --> 4630.400000000001
just do it do it right now

4631.84 --> 4637.84
because you will anyway

4634.0 --> 4637.84
and the sooner you do the better

4648.84 --> 4653.6
right dude

4651.52 --> 4655.360000000001
some beavers

4653.6 --> 4657.76
i'm just thinking now like you could

4655.36 --> 4659.44
even make this into a horror movie or a

4657.76 --> 4660.64
thriller theme

4659.44 --> 4662.879999999999
where there is

4660.64 --> 4665.04
there would be a cult based probably

4662.88 --> 4666.88
turned into like one of the cult movies

4665.04 --> 4669.44
where just

4666.88 --> 4671.52
people are all going mad because they

4669.44 --> 4674.159
can't handle what they know and they

4671.52 --> 4676.400000000001
can't share what they know

4674.159 --> 4679.12
that would be pretty freaky like if some

4676.4 --> 4682.0
person comes and like suddenly

4679.12 --> 4684.239
everything changes but he slept through

4682.0 --> 4686.239
it or something and people are freaked

4684.239 --> 4689.599999999999
out and they refuse to say what it is

4686.239 --> 4691.36
and they start to fabricate

4689.6 --> 4693.4400000000005
all kinds of

4691.36 --> 4696.5599999999995
obvious

4693.44 --> 4698.0
fictional distractions for themselves to

4696.56 --> 4700.96
not

4698.0 --> 4703.12
relay it it would turn eventually into

4700.96 --> 4705.44
like you don't want to know

4703.12 --> 4708.48
and then yeah it would get more and more

4705.44 --> 4711.04
cultish like that but yeah i don't know

4708.48 --> 4713.919999999999
maybe there's already movies like this

4711.04 --> 4717.44
but it is that it is just the inability

4713.92 --> 4720.0
to confront yourself with the reality

4717.44 --> 4722.48
and that also it when you do that it

4720.0 --> 4724.32
amplifies there's illusions about the

4722.48 --> 4727.678999999999
unknown

4724.32 --> 4730.159
beyond that realization point

4727.679 --> 4732.56
that start

4730.159 --> 4734.96
building on top of it it's the boogeyman

4732.56 --> 4739.679
effect because you don't let it in

4734.96 --> 4740.719
more scariness will pile on top of it

4739.679 --> 4743.04
to

4740.719 --> 4746.64
to dissuade you from

4743.04 --> 4746.64
peering at it from a distance

4747.84 --> 4750.96
psychologically that is

4758.719 --> 4762.76
there's your zombie movies

4764.159 --> 4770.239
well dude you could certainly just use

4767.199 --> 4772.719
the world out there as a

4770.239 --> 4774.159
background

4772.719 --> 4775.199
so not actually

4774.159 --> 4776.639999999999
for

4775.199 --> 4777.759999999999
a fascinating

4776.64 --> 4779.1990000000005
story

4777.76 --> 4780.2390000000005
where indeed

4779.199 --> 4783.28
it's

4780.239 --> 4785.44
like a story key part

4783.28 --> 4786.8
should not be too realistic like that

4785.44 --> 4789.12
should still be

4786.8 --> 4791.52
the movie

4789.12 --> 4794.8
where it's just totally logical the the

4791.52 --> 4797.52
way the people are naturally out there

4794.8 --> 4799.6
not even getting involved

4797.52 --> 4802.320000000001
but for the story in the minds of the

4799.6 --> 4803.92
actors and all that in in the story that

4802.32 --> 4806.159
it would make sense the way they are

4803.92 --> 4809.679
they are

4806.159 --> 4809.679
it would almost be like a

4814.719 --> 4820.32
a reality science fiction story where

4818.0 --> 4823.36
you take the reality and then place a

4820.32 --> 4823.36
story over it

4825.92 --> 4830.4
that kind of yeah but then again that

4828.48 --> 4832.5599999999995
also would probably

4830.4 --> 4833.92
depending on the director and the idea

4832.56 --> 4836.2390000000005
could also

4833.92 --> 4838.2390000000005
inspire people to go nuts

4836.239 --> 4840.5599999999995
to become very paranoid and all that so

4838.239 --> 4844.159
yeah maybe

4840.56 --> 4847.4400000000005
it might be dangerous to do that

4844.159 --> 4849.92
but yeah

4847.44 --> 4852.08
those those kind of things scenarios in

4849.92 --> 4854.719
movies and fictions do kind of fascinate

4852.08 --> 4854.719
me at times

4854.8 --> 4859.28
especially thrillers

4857.28 --> 4861.28
where they're not too stupid jump scary

4859.28 --> 4864.438999999999
and [ __ ]

4861.28 --> 4864.438999999999
[Music]

4867.199 --> 4869.599999999999
alright oh by the way talking about

4868.8 --> 4871.92
which

4869.6 --> 4873.280000000001
non-jump scary thrillery

4871.92 --> 4877.84
things

4873.28 --> 4877.84
yeah i completely sat through the gift

4878.08 --> 4882.5599999999995
the netflix series the turkish netflix

4880.32 --> 4884.48
series from yeah to the end of the

4882.56 --> 4887.6
second season and there's definitely

4884.48 --> 4890.159
clues that there could be more following

4887.6 --> 4892.400000000001
but overall it's

4890.159 --> 4894.96
it's a really good series i really

4892.4 --> 4897.04
appreciated it

4894.96 --> 4899.44
also shared that with my dad who is now

4897.04 --> 4903.28
engaging watching it because

4899.44 --> 4907.12
him and his wife will typically like

4903.28 --> 4907.12
just the sensitive level of it

4913.44 --> 4917.28
yeah mark collard i think a lot of

4915.36 --> 4918.799999999999
people do hate that it's like the movies

4917.28 --> 4921.36
where it's just like it's regularly

4918.8 --> 4923.12
boring until somebody just like

4921.36 --> 4925.12
makes a lot of noise and something like

4923.12 --> 4926.8
unexpectedly goes

4925.12 --> 4929.679
it's like people literally all of a

4926.8 --> 4930.56
sudden just banging on everything that

4929.679 --> 4933.52
effect

4930.56 --> 4936.159000000001
it's so stupid

4933.52 --> 4936.159000000001
and annoying

4937.76 --> 4942.4800000000005
yeah i i

4940.08 --> 4944.88
when i watch certain movie reviewers i

4942.48 --> 4946.638999999999
got one that also typically hates that

4944.88 --> 4948.639
and he emphasized that in his movie

4946.639 --> 4951.76
reviews because he does review horror

4948.639 --> 4951.76
movies and all that [ __ ]

4956.239 --> 4961.28
and there's nothing more annoying than

4958.32 --> 4965.96
cheap jump scares to basically

4961.28 --> 4965.96
make the entire story kind of pointless

4977.44 --> 4981.839999999999
right

4979.28 --> 4983.28
well the best thriller effects in horror

4981.84 --> 4985.52
are

4983.28 --> 4986.5599999999995
when there's something there that you

4985.52 --> 4988.320000000001
really

4986.56 --> 4991.92
don't see

4988.32 --> 4994.719
it's like it right there until it moves

4991.92 --> 4996.96
that sort of [ __ ] like really freaks me

4994.719 --> 4998.96
out sometimes and it's very rare it's

4996.96 --> 5000.4800000000005
very tough to do

4998.96 --> 5003.36
no especially

5000.48 --> 5004.4
in a non-cgi fashion but there's some

5003.36 --> 5006.639
older

5004.4 --> 5009.759999999999
horror films that had those moments and

5006.639 --> 5011.76
that's like really because the threat is

5009.76 --> 5013.1990000000005
there right in front of your face and

5011.76 --> 5014.96
you didn't see it and then all of a

5013.199 --> 5016.4
suddenly you see it just

5014.96 --> 5018.2390000000005
[ __ ]

5016.4 --> 5022.48
this is

5018.239 --> 5022.48
that's a real jump scare to me

5025.28 --> 5029.599999999999
and of course there's pretty scary

5027.28 --> 5032.08
spooky effects but there's also pretty

5029.6 --> 5035.52
shitty spooky effects

5032.08 --> 5035.5199999999995
so yeah it all depends

5037.12 --> 5043.36
yeah but indeed throughout the horror

5040.239 --> 5045.36
movies that have been and there's plenty

5043.36 --> 5048.32
the ones that really utilize the

5045.36 --> 5051.04
practical effects have stood the test of

5048.32 --> 5051.04
time the most

5054.159 --> 5057.48
that's right

5058.08 --> 5060.8
there's some like

5061.6 --> 5066.4800000000005
really insanely talented horror prop

5065.04 --> 5067.6
makers too

5066.48 --> 5071.0
out there

5067.6 --> 5071.0
really freaky

5082.96 --> 5088.52
all right i'm gonna round out the shown

5084.88 --> 5088.52
soon by the way

5095.72 --> 5098.829000000001
[Music]

5108.96 --> 5114.4800000000005
the later faces are reasonable

5111.84 --> 5116.56
there's all kinds of new horror movies i

5114.48 --> 5119.04
don't i don't really keep track of

5116.56 --> 5123.6
because i'm not a big fan of horror

5119.04 --> 5123.6
movies in contrast to some other people

5124.32 --> 5129.84
but

5126.88 --> 5132.0
i have seen a couple that are

5129.84 --> 5134.400000000001
more like

5132.0 --> 5137.36
like yeah

5134.4 --> 5139.92
giant mystery spooky thingies sometimes

5137.36 --> 5141.599999999999
with magic and sometimes devil [ __ ] and

5139.92 --> 5143.04
sometimes good

5141.6 --> 5145.84
in there too

5143.04 --> 5148.719
those things kind of sort of fall under

5145.84 --> 5150.719
horror spooky [ __ ] i find those very

5148.719 --> 5153.36
compelling sometimes

5150.719 --> 5156.719
because just regular oh it's a murder or

5153.36 --> 5158.0
oh everybody's zombies yeah yeah yeah

5156.719 --> 5160.32
get it

5158.0 --> 5162.56
i get it already it's seen so much of

5160.32 --> 5162.5599999999995
that

5164.159 --> 5170.4
and often like over time i guess like

5167.199 --> 5172.879999999999
the typical characters in horry horror

5170.4 --> 5174.719
movies on average have actually only

5172.88 --> 5176.4800000000005
gotten worse

5174.719 --> 5177.679
so

5176.48 --> 5178.879999999999
you know

5177.679 --> 5180.56
because there are some older horror

5178.88 --> 5183.6
movies where the characters would be

5180.56 --> 5185.76
really you would really root for them

5183.6 --> 5188.0
making the horror more tragic and all

5185.76 --> 5188.0
that

5188.32 --> 5193.599999999999
well so many horror films these days are

5190.48 --> 5197.12
just have annoying pieces of [ __ ] in

5193.6 --> 5198.2390000000005
them that are like total dicks or [ __ ]

5197.12 --> 5199.12
or just

5198.239 --> 5201.36
ugh

5199.12 --> 5204.32
unbelievably annoying

5201.36 --> 5208.199
this is it's like a terrible habit

5204.32 --> 5208.199
