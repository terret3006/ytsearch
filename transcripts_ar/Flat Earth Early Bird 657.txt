that would be much appreciated and i can

99.28 --> 104.88
really use it at this point i

101.2 --> 106.159
tried to be try to emphasize that a

104.88 --> 109.19999999999999
little over

106.159 --> 110.799
the last few days but it's true i really

109.2 --> 113.92
need support

110.799 --> 117.43900000000001
and though yeah i'm now borrowing that

113.92 --> 117.43900000000001
means i'm going to have to pay it back

119.119 --> 123.36
i can really use your support i already

122.24 --> 126.079
explained this to

123.36 --> 128.16
good servant 2 yesterday i don't want to

126.079 --> 131.76
get all whiney about it

128.16 --> 134.07999999999998
but yeah i've already

131.76 --> 135.28
i basically put down the whole situation

134.08 --> 139.28
and yeah i'm still

135.28 --> 143.68
just having trouble managing through

139.28 --> 147.84
the the big cut in my income last month

143.68 --> 150.959
because of yeah anyway

147.84 --> 153.20000000000002
please do keep supporting me i'm

150.959 --> 156.4
basically now

153.2 --> 160.64
trying to get by food wise and

156.4 --> 163.519
getting really like

160.64 --> 163.51899999999998
i call that

163.92 --> 167.83999999999997
cutting down on everything pretty much

168.84 --> 172.8
so

170.08 --> 174.239
just making sure i last as long as what

172.8 --> 178.87900000000002
with what i got less

174.239 --> 182.08
left as possible so real frustrating in

178.879 --> 182.72
for somebody like me because yeah i

182.08 --> 185.92000000000002
thought that i

182.72 --> 186.319
have been doing excellent problem is

185.92 --> 189.51899999999998
though

186.319 --> 189.51899999999998
when i do excellent

190.159 --> 193.28
it's more expensive like that's really

193.04 --> 197.12
it

193.28 --> 199.44
because i just am into action mode

197.12 --> 201.44
more with what i do and i just burn up

199.44 --> 204.72
more energy

201.44 --> 209.76
i process things my metabolism goes

204.72 --> 209.76
faster effectively it's weird how that

210.84 --> 216.4
works

212.879 --> 222.48
right but i don't want to like

216.4 --> 225.68
fall into a post-summer dip situation

222.48 --> 227.84
but that will happen if i can't just get

225.68 --> 227.84
by

228.319 --> 234.72
that's definitely guaranteed to happen

232.64 --> 237.04
and that'll mean effectively when that

234.72 --> 240.4
happens that i'm basically going to

237.04 --> 242.0
yeah hang around but not do a lot

240.4 --> 244.0
because i don't have the energy because

242.0 --> 246.48
i'm distracted constantly by

244.0 --> 246.48
issues

249.2 --> 254.159
and yeah yesterday in the debates i

251.12 --> 256.56
already felt that

254.159 --> 258.639
like after the show was over it was a

256.56 --> 260.239
pretty good show with what i put down

258.639 --> 261.519
i'm pretty satisfied about it didn't

260.239 --> 263.19899999999996
watch it back but just

261.519 --> 265.68
going on memory yeah i put down some

263.199 --> 265.68
good stuff

266.88 --> 273.199
but yeah i don't feel as free

270.88 --> 274.639
you know when i'm just looking around

273.199 --> 277.36
forward towards the day

274.639 --> 279.12
and it's like yeah i don't have can't do

277.36 --> 280.88
this i can't do that i can't do that and

279.12 --> 282.8
that's not even the long-term things

280.88 --> 283.919
that i want to do it's just like getting

282.8 --> 287.04
by

283.919 --> 289.03999999999996
that's demoralizing to me

287.04 --> 290.8
and that just takes away my sense of

289.04 --> 294.0
freedom

290.8 --> 295.68
and i just don't have anything left to

294.0 --> 299.12
say

295.68 --> 299.12
when i get to that state

301.6 --> 304.56
so yeah

306.72 --> 312.24
but thank you good servant

310.08 --> 315.12
for the 99 cent super chat donation

312.24 --> 315.12
that's very nice

318.96 --> 323.68
right damn i i completely didn't even

322.08 --> 325.919
make any notes yesterday

323.68 --> 328.8
but then again i did have some

325.919 --> 328.79999999999995
interesting things

329.759 --> 336.56
i met a new i think it knew

332.88 --> 338.96
yeah it should be new roommate

336.56 --> 340.639
or a friend of yeah the roommate that it

338.96 --> 342.08
did that typically hang around balcony

340.639 --> 346.56
was a girl

342.08 --> 346.56
and i think she's probably still here

346.639 --> 353.84000000000003
just i think she stayed for the night

350.84 --> 357.039
but yeah she kind of

353.84 --> 358.96
heard me out a little yesterday she was

357.039 --> 359.28
asking like yeah what do you want what

358.96 --> 362.79999999999995
do you

359.28 --> 366.88
what are you doing what do you do

362.8 --> 368.08
and what do you want in the future in

366.88 --> 370.4
your life and

368.08 --> 372.15999999999997
like that's already i was like okay

370.4 --> 373.59999999999997
that's a re that those are really good

372.16 --> 376.72
questions

373.6 --> 378.96000000000004
that's a person that knows how to ask

376.72 --> 380.72
important questions so i was kind of

378.96 --> 383.68
impressed

380.72 --> 384.8
and yeah i basically put in okay i'm

383.68 --> 388.08
effectively

384.8 --> 390.08
sitting am a part of a big project

388.08 --> 391.919
which is very similar to an online

390.08 --> 394.479
university

391.919 --> 395.039
through youtube a community of people

394.479 --> 399.68
that are

395.039 --> 402.15999999999997
developing academic skills

399.68 --> 403.36
and working out physics and having

402.16 --> 407.03900000000004
elaborate debates

403.36 --> 412.24
and discussions and

407.039 --> 414.71999999999997
then i put down okay because here's why

412.24 --> 416.24
uh yeah and i i won't be able to do it

414.72 --> 418.40000000000003
as well as i did yesterday because it

416.24 --> 421.599
was really almost like a spell moment

418.4 --> 425.039
like i caught her attention

421.599 --> 427.84
and it was like i was

425.039 --> 429.919
kind of attracted and that fueled into

427.84 --> 431.039
just my performance of putting it down

429.919 --> 433.84
so i put it down

431.039 --> 434.479
like i wished it was recorded because i

433.84 --> 436.79999999999995
put it down

434.479 --> 439.039
really well basically explained without

436.8 --> 439.91900000000004
mentioning the word flat earth a single

439.039 --> 442.639
time

439.919 --> 443.919
just went through okay scientific method

442.639 --> 445.599
as vantage point

443.919 --> 448.4
we know learn about the scientific

445.599 --> 450.71999999999997
method in school and in university

448.4 --> 453.19899999999996
and explain it in detail in dutch no

450.72 --> 455.36
less and it worked out great

453.199 --> 458.0
about how it's a the critical component

455.36 --> 461.52000000000004
is that it is empirical that you

458.0 --> 463.12
figure out something out there and you

461.52 --> 466.71999999999997
want to know the cause

463.12 --> 469.199
what what causes that what basically

466.72 --> 470.8
creates the phenomena and then you have

469.199 --> 473.199
to find the cause

470.8 --> 474.639
by varying and manipulating it and then

473.199 --> 477.12
yet

474.639 --> 480.319
figuring out whether it is the cause of

477.12 --> 482.0
the effect of the phenomena

480.319 --> 483.68
i probably put it down in dutch even

482.0 --> 486.879
better

483.68 --> 488.8
and from that point explained like okay

486.879 --> 492.16
well if we know this and this is the

488.8 --> 495.68
foundation of the renaissance

492.16 --> 498.0
the enlightenment and yeah

495.68 --> 499.12
that's what we built a lot on that's

498.0 --> 502.96
what we

499.12 --> 506.08
modernized our societal understanding on

502.96 --> 507.19899999999996
it's the enlightenment but then at some

506.08 --> 510.56
point

507.199 --> 513.919
yeah the establishment started to evade

510.56 --> 515.039
from it by just letting all kinds of

513.919 --> 518.3199999999999
people

515.039 --> 521.8389999999999
claim science without using the

518.32 --> 521.839
scientific method

522.159 --> 528.959
and like she already like

525.839 --> 532.399
yeah you got a point and then yeah

528.959 --> 535.68
like society is riddled with it

532.399 --> 537.04
there's entire fields maybe it's like

535.68 --> 540.3199999999999
half or a third of

537.04 --> 541.519
like the common fields you study that

540.32 --> 544.6400000000001
are

541.519 --> 547.44
full of giant mistakes and

544.64 --> 548.64
unconfirmed things things that

547.44 --> 554.1600000000001
eventually

548.64 --> 554.16
are determined through peer reviewing

554.48 --> 558.24
which yeah is basically determined on

557.36 --> 561.6800000000001
people that

558.24 --> 563.839
decide for the rest

561.68 --> 564.8
what the truth is instead of the

563.839 --> 567.839
repeatable

564.8 --> 570.0799999999999
scientific method so i put that down

567.839 --> 571.519
that whole thing and she was quite

570.08 --> 574.5600000000001
impressed

571.519 --> 578.0
it was really funny because yeah

574.56 --> 579.68
my neighbor girl like

578.0 --> 582.32
i told her about flat earth and she

579.68 --> 585.1999999999999
disagrees so she's got

582.32 --> 586.32
she has no grip on it at all at all

585.2 --> 588.6400000000001
she's like a noob

586.32 --> 591.12
and she's triggered so she was like yeah

588.64 --> 592.64
but there are things i'm objecting to

591.12 --> 594.5600000000001
there are things i'm objecting to and

592.64 --> 596.24
i'm like i didn't even respond to that

594.56 --> 597.279
because i knew there was about the flat

596.24 --> 599.279
air thing

597.279 --> 601.519
and about probably holographic nature of

599.279 --> 604.56
the heavenly lights and all that

601.519 --> 605.68
i didn't even mention it and she was

604.56 --> 608.4799999999999
already getting

605.68 --> 609.3599999999999
triggered like the whole situation was

608.48 --> 613.9200000000001
so telling

609.36 --> 616.5600000000001
in general it's it yeah it was private

613.92 --> 617.12
but it was pure gold i'm kind of sorry

616.56 --> 621.1999999999999
that i

617.12 --> 624.88
didn't record it it would have been

621.2 --> 626.6400000000001
a great snippet for for members only

624.88 --> 629.68
video

626.64 --> 631.1999999999999
but yeah now at least i can just talk

629.68 --> 634.2399999999999
about it

631.2 --> 634.24
share what it was like

634.56 --> 640.959
right so yeah that was

638.24 --> 640.9590000000001
yesterday

641.839 --> 645.9200000000001
i haven't caught owen benjamin live he

644.24 --> 649.36
might have been i but i missed it if

645.92 --> 652.56
that were the case but i don't think so

649.36 --> 656.16
uh was she

652.56 --> 661.8389999999999
also girlfriend material well

656.16 --> 661.8389999999999
yeah maybe maybe

662.24 --> 666.24
i think she you know i think she's at

665.839 --> 670.1600000000001
least

666.24 --> 672.5600000000001
intelligent enough now every time

670.16 --> 673.6
i find someone that's intelligent enough

672.56 --> 675.92
then the next

673.6 --> 677.76
heavy question comes and you can't just

675.92 --> 681.1999999999999
answer that so easily

677.76 --> 685.12
you gotta take your time is how well or

681.2 --> 688.1600000000001
is the more like moral conscious

685.12 --> 690.079
because so many

688.16 --> 691.68
very intelligent people out there

690.079 --> 694.079
especially women and

691.68 --> 694.8
even more young women that are extremely

694.079 --> 698.8
intelligent

694.8 --> 702.0
just get grabbled get culturally drug in

698.8 --> 705.04
get praised by other intelligent

702.0 --> 706.079
people that then project onto them like

705.04 --> 708.959
yeah

706.079 --> 710.3199999999999
so if you're really smart then you gotta

708.959 --> 714.0
leave the notion

710.32 --> 720.0
that good is right behind

714.0 --> 720.0
serious they literally did that to me

720.56 --> 726.4799999999999
and intuitively it doesn't work but

724.32 --> 728.5600000000001
intellectually i tried to basically

726.48 --> 733.6
presuppose that for a while

728.56 --> 733.5999999999999
with some terrible results

737.12 --> 745.12
uh yeah and that's way back in the past

741.519 --> 749.92
so yeah is

745.12 --> 749.92
has she been tested like that has she

750.079 --> 755.1999999999999
managed to defend herself against such a

753.44 --> 758.639
thing

755.2 --> 761.9200000000001
i've never even met a person

758.639 --> 763.279
that has actually managed to do that

761.92 --> 766.959
like that

763.279 --> 770.959
so you know yeah time will tell but

766.959 --> 774.16
also just yeah you know the biggest part

770.959 --> 777.76
on the on the forefront is

774.16 --> 779.8389999999999
that she would ask important question

777.76 --> 781.519
that i would tell her just to her face

779.839 --> 783.44
honestly like yeah i want

781.519 --> 785.44
a wife and children in a house and a

783.44 --> 788.48
garden

785.44 --> 793.519
and that she was actually

788.48 --> 796.5600000000001
like um that's good

793.519 --> 800.16
so that response to me is

796.56 --> 802.0
telling me like hey i'm actually in the

800.16 --> 804.56
right position now

802.0 --> 807.04
i've i really want the right things i

804.56 --> 811.04
really want that

807.04 --> 813.12
and yeah 20 years ago if somebody would

811.04 --> 814.0
have asked me this i would not have said

813.12 --> 816.8
that

814.0 --> 819.44
i would have been like in no way i need

816.8 --> 821.8389999999999
all that time for myself

819.44 --> 823.7600000000001
and whatever i want to do squirting with

821.839 --> 827.1990000000001
my girlfriend or something

823.76 --> 830.24
and yeah i really grew out of that

827.199 --> 832.4799999999999
kind of after 30 i that just

830.24 --> 834.48
that attitude just dropped and i figured

832.48 --> 837.76
out like this

834.48 --> 837.76
like it runs out

838.079 --> 843.3599999999999
what you think that you can just last

840.72 --> 846.48
your entire life just doing that

843.36 --> 846.48
it runs out

846.72 --> 850.9590000000001
and i had to figure that out the hard

848.8 --> 850.959
way

854.839 --> 861.0400000000001
okay but anyway

857.44 --> 861.0400000000001
yeah girlfriend material maybe

862.72 --> 870.0790000000001
but maybe i'm just going to

865.839 --> 872.8000000000001
enjoy meeting by happenstance more

870.079 --> 875.04
people and just figuring myself out and

872.8 --> 878.3199999999999
my attitude out you know

875.04 --> 881.76
like these things these details

878.32 --> 884.88
are very rare to me now you know

881.76 --> 885.36
i'm very happy that i have this new

884.88 --> 888.32
person

885.36 --> 888.9590000000001
in the house that just brings people

888.32 --> 893.6
over

888.959 --> 897.5189999999999
over and that i kind of can connect with

893.6 --> 899.9200000000001
because that's been a long time a series

897.519 --> 900.9590000000001
like an a sort of an open group dynamic

899.92 --> 903.92
where i can just step

900.959 --> 904.7199999999999
in as a semi-outsider and i kind of know

903.92 --> 907.8389999999999
my right

904.72 --> 912.0790000000001
i kind of have a frequency there that

907.839 --> 915.12
is extremely rare to me

912.079 --> 915.92
because usually if i try that i just end

915.12 --> 919.199
up

915.92 --> 920.8
growing completely silent

919.199 --> 922.639
and then just sitting there being

920.8 --> 925.4399999999999
extremely self-conscious and like

922.639 --> 927.04
what am i doing here i don't connect

925.44 --> 928.5600000000001
with these people at all they wouldn't

927.04 --> 931.5999999999999
understand the single thing that i

928.56 --> 932.88
want to say actually you know because i

931.6 --> 935.519
could just

932.88 --> 937.4399999999999
ramble out all kinds of geek remarks and

935.519 --> 939.6
nerdy details

937.44 --> 940.5600000000001
kind of like what i do during the flat

939.6 --> 943.1990000000001
earth debates

940.56 --> 945.279
and all that but most people just don't

943.199 --> 947.199
even understand what i would be what i'm

945.279 --> 949.92
saying

947.199 --> 952.079
because people aren't used to that at

949.92 --> 952.079
all

952.839 --> 955.839
anymore

956.079 --> 963.199
it's yeah it's like gone away

959.759 --> 963.1990000000001
that sort of thing a lot

964.399 --> 969.92
anyway where is everyone oh wait

968.16 --> 973.36
usually when i ask that it means that

969.92 --> 976.079
people are just really listening

973.36 --> 978.32
and therefore not typing or or talking

976.079 --> 980.2399999999999
since i forget sometimes yes sometimes

978.32 --> 981.44
people listen and then things go quiet

980.24 --> 983.36
and i'm like

981.44 --> 986.1600000000001
everybody's abandoned me no they're

983.36 --> 986.16
actually listening

989.519 --> 992.639
don't get sucked in

992.8 --> 998.8
by what by getting a girlfriend

1000.72 --> 1004.48
suck sucked in by what exactly no this

1003.199 --> 1007.519
is just about me

1004.48 --> 1010.0
developing my social dynamics

1007.519 --> 1012.24
you know just because here on the

1010.0 --> 1014.72
internet i kind of have my attitude and

1012.24 --> 1017.279
i kind of know who i am and people

1014.72 --> 1017.759
figure out like yeah that's our win

1017.279 --> 1020.0
right

1017.759 --> 1022.399
that's how i conduct myself over on the

1020.0 --> 1025.6
internet right

1022.399 --> 1027.76
that is completely different

1025.6 --> 1030.3999999999999
from how things work in the physical

1027.76 --> 1030.4
world for me

1030.72 --> 1036.839
because there's a physical presence

1033.839 --> 1039.839
and the whole energy dynamic just works

1036.839 --> 1039.839
differently

1044.079 --> 1047.9189999999999
oh yeah thanks good servant don't worry

1046.72 --> 1051.44
about it man

1047.919 --> 1055.3600000000001
look don't make my issues

1051.44 --> 1055.76
your issues dude you don't have any to

1055.36 --> 1058.8799999999999
give

1055.76 --> 1061.76
or not not enough

1058.88 --> 1062.64
for your own liking don't worry about it

1061.76 --> 1066.559
it's all about

1062.64 --> 1072.0
people that have things to give

1066.559 --> 1072.0
and then me hoping that i'm worth it

1075.919 --> 1079.6000000000001
and also i have a lot of complaint

1077.84 --> 1082.48
towards myself

1079.6 --> 1084.3999999999999
building up and that is that yeah my

1082.48 --> 1087.84
improvisation it works

1084.4 --> 1088.96
works really well it's like almost

1087.84 --> 1091.6
[Music]

1088.96 --> 1092.16
like like a start sign during a race the

1091.6 --> 1094.08
problem is

1092.16 --> 1095.76
if not if the start sign doesn't come

1094.08 --> 1097.84
there is no race

1095.76 --> 1099.76
and this is kind of a weird dynamic for

1097.84 --> 1102.72
me and my own show is that

1099.76 --> 1104.0
if nothing just rolls in then nothing

1102.72 --> 1107.76
really happens

1104.0 --> 1110.0
and there's not a lot of consistency

1107.76 --> 1111.6
in what there's no yeah pattern

1110.0 --> 1114.64
consistency there's no

1111.6 --> 1117.76
standard flow besides the show structure

1114.64 --> 1119.6000000000001
the intro what i typically do

1117.76 --> 1121.84
what yeah going through the list like i

1119.6 --> 1122.799
try to give some baseline structure

1121.84 --> 1125.76
right

1122.799 --> 1127.44
but yeah that's not the same thing as a

1125.76 --> 1128.96
structure of like the information

1127.44 --> 1130.64
quality

1128.96 --> 1132.64
and the origins and everything that

1130.64 --> 1137.2
comes out of me because that is kind of

1132.64 --> 1139.8400000000001
erratic and that is bothering me

1137.2 --> 1141.1200000000001
because yeah almost everyone else out

1139.84 --> 1144.76
there has like

1141.12 --> 1148.6399999999999
typical show

1144.76 --> 1152.4
presentation consistency

1148.64 --> 1154.0800000000002
and it's so different from what i do

1152.4 --> 1155.44
although yeah back in the day you know

1154.08 --> 1158.72
with the flatter talks

1155.44 --> 1160.4
i i did do that and it was kind of

1158.72 --> 1162.48
decent still some

1160.4 --> 1164.72
tendencies too erratic but that's me

1162.48 --> 1167.1200000000001
that's me you know every time

1164.72 --> 1168.0
when i try to do things too much under

1167.12 --> 1170.3999999999999
control

1168.0 --> 1172.08
it is really like a societal response

1170.4 --> 1174.16
you know because this happens in school

1172.08 --> 1177.28
it happens everywhere what happens when

1174.16 --> 1180.3200000000002
i just have to behave

1177.28 --> 1184.24
it's like my ego gets like yeah

1180.32 --> 1186.8799999999999
screw everything i'm going to just

1184.24 --> 1188.24
pop out just like that and just blow

1186.88 --> 1192.24
everyone's mind

1188.24 --> 1195.36
out of nowhere just like shocking

1192.24 --> 1196.32
things but not in in a creepy kind of

1195.36 --> 1199.4399999999998
way but just

1196.32 --> 1202.3999999999999
shock people and that's what it does

1199.44 --> 1202.4
i got that in me

1202.559 --> 1208.3999999999999
and even when i do my own presentations

1206.0 --> 1210.08
then it still happens it's like i go

1208.4 --> 1212.24
through that and suddenly out of nowhere

1210.08 --> 1215.1999999999998
this idea comes

1212.24 --> 1215.76
i throw it out there and yeah it changed

1215.2 --> 1218.48
everything

1215.76 --> 1220.96
it changed all expectations of what it

1218.48 --> 1223.2
would become the situation

1220.96 --> 1223.2
see

1224.24 --> 1228.88
and that element yeah it's valuable it's

1226.799 --> 1232.0
kind of unique

1228.88 --> 1235.8400000000001
but it also makes me just

1232.0 --> 1235.84
very different from everyone else

1236.96 --> 1241.6000000000001
and i guess there's a lot of people out

1240.96 --> 1244.0
there

1241.6 --> 1246.3999999999999
although i don't know if it's that bad

1244.0 --> 1248.32
as i think it would be

1246.4 --> 1251.44
that just can't really get used to me

1248.32 --> 1251.4399999999998
and how i do things

1252.799 --> 1263.84
more than probably with other people

1264.32 --> 1270.0
oh really i don't blow people's minds

1267.44 --> 1270.0
yeah i do

1273.679 --> 1280.72
i definitely do you know and

1277.36 --> 1283.9189999999999
hey when i'm out here and it's not being

1280.72 --> 1286.88
recorded right i

1283.919 --> 1288.72
kind of people forget about this right

1286.88 --> 1292.88
they forget about this

1288.72 --> 1294.559
i'm technically censoring parts of

1292.88 --> 1297.44
myself here

1294.559 --> 1299.2
from the start as in like there are

1297.44 --> 1300.3200000000002
certain things that i wouldn't want to

1299.2 --> 1301.919
talk about

1300.32 --> 1303.6
because i don't think it should be

1301.919 --> 1306.0800000000002
talked about in in

1303.6 --> 1307.6789999999999
on record open like that not because

1306.08 --> 1309.52
their subjects not

1307.679 --> 1310.799
worthy to talk about but because it's

1309.52 --> 1314.1589999999999
like dangerous

1310.799 --> 1314.48
yeah real information real insight can

1314.159 --> 1318.159
be

1314.48 --> 1318.72
dangerous yeah so i don't do that just

1318.159 --> 1322.159
like that

1318.72 --> 1325.84
as easily up here and therefore i shave

1322.159 --> 1328.96
off the top what could be pretty damn

1325.84 --> 1331.76
mind-blowing peak informations

1328.96 --> 1333.3600000000001
i don't even think about that i'm

1331.76 --> 1337.36
missing that part because

1333.36 --> 1339.52
i just decided it's not allowed

1337.36 --> 1340.799
but that doesn't mean it's not allowed

1339.52 --> 1344.08
out here

1340.799 --> 1346.24
face to face where i know it's like okay

1344.08 --> 1347.36
it's not being recorded right okay here

1346.24 --> 1350.88
is just

1347.36 --> 1354.3999999999999
the full scope and then i do

1350.88 --> 1361.6000000000001
kind of blow people's mind yeah i do

1354.4 --> 1365.2
billy was a

1361.6 --> 1367.039
right but hey if you scratch your head

1365.2 --> 1369.039
and roll your eyes you know that can

1367.039 --> 1372.32
also be just a sign of

1369.039 --> 1373.44
embarrassment and then basically giving

1372.32 --> 1376.96
off a signal like

1373.44 --> 1379.76
oh i'm above all that right that's

1376.96 --> 1381.44
that's a social defense strategy it

1379.76 --> 1384.64
works really well

1381.44 --> 1386.96
universally especially when you don't

1384.64 --> 1390.159
get what the [ __ ] is being talked about

1386.96 --> 1392.08
but you can't allow yourself from a

1390.159 --> 1395.2800000000002
social perspective to

1392.08 --> 1396.6399999999999
show some humility and basically be

1395.28 --> 1398.96
classified as

1396.64 --> 1401.3600000000001
knowing less than the people that are

1398.96 --> 1405.2
sharing that information with you

1401.36 --> 1407.52
you know so it's just a very standard

1405.2 --> 1410.72
response to do that

1407.52 --> 1413.12
right it doesn't mean that

1410.72 --> 1414.64
minds aren't actually blown out there

1413.12 --> 1417.6789999999999
but yeah the thing about

1414.64 --> 1420.4
minds being blown is you gotta get there

1417.679 --> 1422.0
it's like you gotta lit the fuse and if

1420.4 --> 1425.1200000000001
the fuse is all wet

1422.0 --> 1426.88
because of squirting yeah

1425.12 --> 1429.36
then your mind doesn't get blown because

1426.88 --> 1432.4
the fuse won't lit up

1429.36 --> 1433.36
it won't it won't catch so it's just a

1432.4 --> 1436.0800000000002
fizzle

1433.36 --> 1437.52
and then yeah you can scratch your head

1436.08 --> 1440.6399999999999
and roll your eyes

1437.52 --> 1440.6399999999999
you still won't get it

1440.72 --> 1443.76
yeah that's right you don't understand

1442.48 --> 1446.799
billy was a

1443.76 --> 1446.799
that's that's correct

1451.84 --> 1456.24
now it's not an at home it's a

1454.0 --> 1460.4
description

1456.24 --> 1463.679
it's literally a process description

1460.4 --> 1465.44
very distinct psychologically and then

1463.679 --> 1468.64
using metaphors

1465.44 --> 1471.6000000000001
as a fuse to blow your mind right what

1468.64 --> 1472.159
fuse is wet because of squirting and

1471.6 --> 1475.1999999999998
that's

1472.159 --> 1478.4
also squirting

1475.2 --> 1480.0800000000002
doing that dumbing you down right and

1478.4 --> 1484.0
squirting is not just

1480.08 --> 1488.24
a specific sexual action no it's also

1484.0 --> 1491.919
like just giving in to seduction

1488.24 --> 1495.1200000000001
giving into anger giving into basic

1491.919 --> 1497.2
behavior and not

1495.12 --> 1500.9599999999998
take the pressure and think about it

1497.2 --> 1504.0
really carefully and try to migrate

1500.96 --> 1507.1200000000001
your insights of what truth is and

1504.0 --> 1509.76
change your position to become better

1507.12 --> 1511.6
that yeah when you squirt all of that

1509.76 --> 1515.44
kind of

1511.6 --> 1517.84
it kind of goes away and you become more

1515.44 --> 1520.559
you get you get a bigger tendency to

1517.84 --> 1523.52
just real erode everything you do

1520.559 --> 1529.84
with standard responses that you think

1523.52 --> 1529.84
are widely acceptable

1540.84 --> 1543.84
see

1545.52 --> 1553.279
yeah and so if you do that

1549.52 --> 1556.8799999999999
if you're not interested

1553.279 --> 1557.52
in getting over yourself and that you're

1556.88 --> 1560.96
probably

1557.52 --> 1563.36
not in the full truth of everything

1560.96 --> 1565.44
at all times that you make mistakes and

1563.36 --> 1568.0
that you're going to make more mistakes

1565.44 --> 1571.1200000000001
and that it is up to us

1568.0 --> 1574.0
to grow out of them to

1571.12 --> 1576.2399999999998
undergo the personal test of god and

1574.0 --> 1578.559
creation

1576.24 --> 1581.6
if you don't do that yeah then your mind

1578.559 --> 1584.48
is not going to be blown so easily

1581.6 --> 1585.1999999999998
your your mind will probably be blown

1584.48 --> 1588.32
more by

1585.2 --> 1591.279
standard conjecture standard

1588.32 --> 1592.559
interesting exciting sounding stories

1591.279 --> 1597.2
more esoteric

1592.559 --> 1600.559
excitement set of esoteric excitement

1597.2 --> 1601.679
where actual insights are just gripping

1600.559 --> 1605.36
you and you suddenly

1601.679 --> 1607.679
really oversee long-term things you know

1605.36 --> 1610.3999999999999
real minds get blown when you start to

1607.679 --> 1613.76
see things and structures

1610.4 --> 1616.5590000000002
and that reach out beyond

1613.76 --> 1618.72
where your current understanding in that

1616.559 --> 1620.48
moment in time is actually at

1618.72 --> 1622.72
when you see things you don't yet

1620.48 --> 1625.44
understand but you know you will

1622.72 --> 1627.2
that is when your mind is blown that's

1625.44 --> 1630.159
really when your mind is blown

1627.2 --> 1632.559
yeah you can't get there if your mind is

1630.159 --> 1634.48
in a railroad system

1632.559 --> 1641.36
the only thing you can do is just get to

1634.48 --> 1643.84
the next stop

1641.36 --> 1643.84
all right

1653.039 --> 1657.44
can you have gas pressure in a closed

1655.12 --> 1657.4399999999998
mind

1659.12 --> 1664.9599999999998
well mind doesn't have volumetric

1665.2 --> 1670.96
aspects to it mind only has virtual

1668.64 --> 1670.96
space

1671.36 --> 1674.7199999999998
information space which is not expressed

1673.76 --> 1678.1589999999999
in volume

1674.72 --> 1678.159
in physical volume so

1680.159 --> 1683.7600000000002
no you can't have gas pressure in a

1682.0 --> 1685.919
closed mind you can't have gas pressure

1683.76 --> 1688.8799999999999
in an open mind because mind is not a

1685.919 --> 1688.88
gas container

1689.36 --> 1691.76
i know

1698.56 --> 1703.279
[Music]

1701.2 --> 1705.279
i'm just looking and i'm wondering like

1703.279 --> 1708.799
who who is this

1705.279 --> 1712.64
this troll because i'm being

1708.799 --> 1712.6399999999999
really nice and civil and

1714.32 --> 1716.559
what

1720.96 --> 1724.08
i don't even know who this person is but

1723.52 --> 1726.559
he is

1724.08 --> 1727.6
just a troll i don't think he's even a

1726.559 --> 1730.1589999999999
cosmogenist

1727.6 --> 1732.24
i don't think he is is a glober it's

1730.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
just a piece of [ __ ] troll

1732.24 --> 1739.84
scumbag that's it so he's gone

1741.36 --> 1746.559
it's not there to to do anything

1746.72 --> 1751.279
right yeah he was trolling he was

1749.279 --> 1754.88
trolling you too

1751.279 --> 1757.44
he just hated cosmogeny he just hates

1754.88 --> 1758.72
thinking he's probably just a real true

1757.44 --> 1762.0800000000002
bottom feeter

1758.72 --> 1765.3600000000001
feeder [ __ ] that's just been

1762.08 --> 1766.08
so disgusting and indulgent with himself

1765.36 --> 1769.12
in his life

1766.08 --> 1770.72
that he just can't handle any

1769.12 --> 1781.84
information anymore he just

1770.72 --> 1781.84
wants it all to stop

1787.679 --> 1793.1200000000001
oh george sanford well i'm not waiting

1790.72 --> 1809.84
on that if you know what i mean

1793.12 --> 1809.84
because yeah it's never gonna happen

1823.6 --> 1829.4399999999998
right what was that talking about

1829.76 --> 1837.84
before that troll came in

1833.44 --> 1837.8400000000001
i forgot

1846.159 --> 1851.44
anyway yeah i hope you guys appreciate

1848.96 --> 1855.6000000000001
that little analysis

1851.44 --> 1858.3200000000002
and yeah please if you do if you can

1855.6 --> 1864.0
support me through the paypal it's kind

1858.32 --> 1867.4399999999998
of urgent

1864.0 --> 1872.159
because yeah i'm getting food

1867.44 --> 1872.159
shortages well

1873.36 --> 1877.519
and i borrowed some money as i said i

1875.919 --> 1880.5590000000002
would have to

1877.519 --> 1882.64
just get back by in like the next few

1880.559 --> 1886.6399999999999
days but

1882.64 --> 1889.279
yeah i really need some

1886.64 --> 1891.3600000000001
support here and then i can keep it

1889.279 --> 1892.559
going and then i don't have to worry

1891.36 --> 1895.039
half of the day

1892.559 --> 1895.039
about it

1897.12 --> 1900.399
because that really sucks

1901.2 --> 1907.1200000000001
that is very distracting

1904.559 --> 1909.44
more so than trolls getting in my way

1907.12 --> 1909.4399999999998
you know

1909.76 --> 1915.76
trolls are like a complete joke are

1912.399 --> 1918.6399999999999
literally a joke and just pure laughter

1915.76 --> 1919.6
when i'm not stressing out over

1918.64 --> 1921.76
something

1919.6 --> 1923.9189999999999
because when i am stressing out over

1921.76 --> 1928.48
something and they're trolling

1923.919 --> 1928.48
then yeah they make a point every time

1931.2 --> 1938.0800000000002
because yeah if i feel stressed out and

1934.399 --> 1938.08
shitty then it's like okay what

1939.039 --> 1942.24
is this getting to something

1944.24 --> 1949.84
i mean i'm doing what i'm ca what i can

1950.24 --> 1953.44
giving everything i got

1953.519 --> 1960.3990000000001
showing off my skills improving them

1957.679 --> 1960.72
helping explanation just like being on

1960.399 --> 1963.12
the

1960.72 --> 1964.32
on the tip of the spear when it comes to

1963.12 --> 1967.76
technical

1964.32 --> 1970.8799999999999
explanations of very complicated things

1967.76 --> 1970.8799999999999
that's kind of my thing

1975.679 --> 1980.96
how does volume work in a looping system

1978.72 --> 1980.96
what

1981.279 --> 1986.08
what do you mean with that that's an odd

1988.84 --> 1991.84
question

1994.08 --> 2001.279
oh you mean uh

1998.24 --> 2004.159
right spatial volume i thought you were

2001.279 --> 2005.12
referring to music volume or something

2004.159 --> 2008.7990000000002
it's like what

2005.12 --> 2008.799
sound waves in the looping system

2010.0 --> 2015.2
which could work by the way yeah in a

2013.2 --> 2016.559
looping system the volume is basically

2015.2 --> 2019.3600000000001
just interconnected so

2016.559 --> 2020.96
the same volume just connects with

2019.36 --> 2023.039
itself

2020.96 --> 2024.3990000000001
so yeah it's like a box and it's

2023.039 --> 2027.6
interconnected so one

2024.399 --> 2033.84
side connects to once to the other

2027.6 --> 2033.84
and at the other side it's the same

2045.519 --> 2050.96
and yes effectively

2048.72 --> 2050.9599999999996
if

2052.56 --> 2058.96
right doesn't it i don't know what's

2056.32 --> 2061.04
going on with my tongue man

2058.96 --> 2062.56
i'm still having some jaw issues and it

2061.04 --> 2063.679
is getting in the way of just my

2062.56 --> 2068.0
fluidness

2063.679 --> 2071.119
it's even eating stress and all that

2068.0 --> 2073.679
right but yeah i explained it very early

2071.119 --> 2076.8790000000004
on in the looping system

2073.679 --> 2079.52
a loop would effectively be a wall

2076.879 --> 2082.879
container because the gas is going to be

2079.52 --> 2082.879
pressing on itself

2085.359 --> 2089.359
you know gas does press in all

2087.04 --> 2093.44
directions against itself

2089.359 --> 2095.2799999999997
too right no directions so yeah

2093.44 --> 2097.119
if it's going to press in all directions

2095.28 --> 2099.8390000000004
then over here it's simply

2097.119 --> 2101.599
again going to press in on itself so

2099.839 --> 2104.0
that's

2101.599 --> 2106.56
as good as a physical wall of a

2104.0 --> 2106.56
container

2107.92 --> 2122.0
and there is no gap indeed

2117.76 --> 2128.0
what are you talking about

2122.0 --> 2128.0
ether please hold her for matter to feel

2128.839 --> 2131.839
what

2136.32 --> 2146.56
yes well it's not as much even

2142.079 --> 2149.04
look a wall of the container

2146.56 --> 2151.599
is not neces it doesn't even have to be

2149.04 --> 2154.72
a physical thing to push against

2151.599 --> 2158.7200000000003
the what really but this is yeah this

2154.72 --> 2160.72
ranges into conceptual unproven things

2158.72 --> 2162.48
but it is conceptual so yeah it's very

2160.72 --> 2164.72
hard to kind of draw this

2162.48 --> 2165.599
and just say it in the flatter debates

2164.72 --> 2168.9599999999996
like that

2165.599 --> 2171.839
but technically a container

2168.96 --> 2173.04
doesn't need physical walls it just

2171.839 --> 2177.52
needs

2173.04 --> 2180.56
a consequential limited volume

2177.52 --> 2183.28
whether that be through walls or three

2180.56 --> 2183.2799999999997
through a loop

2184.839 --> 2191.839
see so

2187.28 --> 2195.52
see it like this a container could be

2191.839 --> 2199.2799999999997
a tube in the tube

2195.52 --> 2201.7599999999998
there is the the circular wall

2199.28 --> 2202.8
and then there's the ends which are

2201.76 --> 2205.92
probably two

2202.8 --> 2208.6400000000003
to just flat parts and they

2205.92 --> 2209.6800000000003
are walls for any gas that's in there

2208.64 --> 2212.7999999999997
well

2209.68 --> 2216.3199999999997
if instead of two flat ends

2212.8 --> 2218.5600000000004
it would be like a donut and then

2216.32 --> 2221.04
yeah suddenly there have to be no more

2218.56 --> 2224.88
flat parts only

2221.04 --> 2228.079
the circular parts and that is

2224.88 --> 2231.359
how a loop is effectively also

2228.079 --> 2233.52
a container wall because there is a

2231.359 --> 2243.839
limit to the amount of space

2233.52 --> 2243.839
that the gas can travel in

2244.4 --> 2257.839
so yeah containers are all about the

2247.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
limited amount of space

2262.24 --> 2266.56
but yeah since we can't create miniature

2265.68 --> 2269.7599999999998
looping

2266.56 --> 2271.44
space the only way to actually

2269.76 --> 2273.76
effectively prove

2271.44 --> 2275.599
how gas pressure in containers work is

2273.76 --> 2278.03
with physical containers

2275.599 --> 2279.92
and there's the practical reality

2278.03 --> 2285.76
[Music]

2279.92 --> 2291.04
uh do gases have mass

2285.76 --> 2291.0400000000004
well gases do have density

2291.2 --> 2293.52
and

2295.359 --> 2302.48
effectively you can deduce mass

2298.4 --> 2305.04
from that in a set volume sure

2302.48 --> 2309.04
but mass is not an is not a literal

2305.04 --> 2309.04
thing though it's only a deduced based

2310.839 --> 2313.839
concept

2339.18 --> 2343.9199999999996
[Music]

2341.839 --> 2346.24
you need a container to have weight

2343.92 --> 2346.2400000000002
that's

2346.88 --> 2357.2000000000003
if you took that technically literally

2355.839 --> 2358.96
yeah you're actually kind of correct

2357.2 --> 2362.72
that's funny because

2358.96 --> 2366.0
yeah weight is is a convention

2362.72 --> 2369.52
based on air weight on weight and

2366.0 --> 2374.24
standard air pressure

2369.52 --> 2377.599
or yeah the density disequilibrium force

2374.24 --> 2379.04
registry in air in regular air pressure

2377.599 --> 2380.839
and yes since you

2379.04 --> 2383.7599999999998
since that is an air you need a

2380.839 --> 2385.2
container

2383.76 --> 2387.599
yeah that's funny you're kind of right

2385.2 --> 2388.48
with that concert you need a container

2387.599 --> 2391.52
to have

2388.48 --> 2392.32
weight there's no container then there's

2391.52 --> 2395.359
no

2392.32 --> 2399.28
standard air pressure to have

2395.359 --> 2399.2799999999997
the convention of weight in

2404.8 --> 2410.079
tire doesn't have a pressure gradient

2407.119 --> 2414.96
does it

2410.079 --> 2414.96
what the hell uh

2420.56 --> 2425.68
well maybe but it would be extremely

2424.16 --> 2429.04
minute and since it's

2425.68 --> 2430.7999999999997
yeah the smaller it is the more

2429.04 --> 2432.8
like it's too difficult to create a

2430.8 --> 2435.8390000000004
gradient

2432.8 --> 2437.8390000000004
in a very small confine unless it's like

2435.839 --> 2439.119
extremely pressurized because the more

2437.839 --> 2453.839
the pressure

2439.119 --> 2453.839
then the easier any gradient will set in

2470.4 --> 2475.6800000000003
all right so technically all containers

2473.04 --> 2475.68
with gas

2476.96 --> 2483.2
yeah you can almost say that

2480.0 --> 2487.119
because of relative density all

2483.2 --> 2490.72
gas all gas if

2487.119 --> 2491.92
if they were not subjected to any motion

2490.72 --> 2493.52
whatsoever if

2491.92 --> 2497.04
kept perfectly still which is a

2493.52 --> 2500.56
technical impossibility in the realm

2497.04 --> 2503.68
but if if there was

2500.56 --> 2506.0789999999997
such a thing as perfect stillness in a

2503.68 --> 2509.359
specific container with

2506.079 --> 2512.5600000000004
whatever size whatever gas in it

2509.359 --> 2515.68
then yes all gases would always form

2512.56 --> 2516.7999999999997
gradients always all of them at all all

2515.68 --> 2520.8799999999997
times

2516.8 --> 2523.599
problem is though is that yeah

2520.88 --> 2524.0
the air is dynamic and there is motion

2523.599 --> 2526.8
so

2524.0 --> 2528.16
it mixes up and the smaller it is the

2526.8 --> 2531.2000000000003
more it mixes up and then

2528.16 --> 2533.359
any potential for a gradient it's just

2531.2 --> 2536.48
never going to happen

2533.359 --> 2540.0789999999997
oh by the way thank you john d

2536.48 --> 2551.839
diano for the 5 new zealand dollar super

2540.079 --> 2551.8390000000004
chat donation thank you very much

2558.16 --> 2563.44
yeah dynamic system

2561.68 --> 2566.0
doesn't explain why there is a

2563.44 --> 2569.119
consistent pressure gradient

2566.0 --> 2571.44
no just saying that doesn't but i did

2569.119 --> 2574.4
explain the entire thing

2571.44 --> 2578.0
so the bigger it is and the more

2574.4 --> 2581.6800000000003
pressure there is both these factors

2578.0 --> 2582.56
cause gradients to become more

2581.68 --> 2584.3999999999996
pronounced

2582.56 --> 2586.72
so the bigger the container the more

2584.4 --> 2588.319
pronounced the gas pressure gradient

2586.72 --> 2589.839
the higher the pressure the more

2588.319 --> 2593.119
pronounced the gas pressure

2589.839 --> 2595.839
gradient these two factors and that's

2593.119 --> 2595.839
how it works

2597.119 --> 2602.2400000000002
and if you put a fan in there yeah then

2599.92 --> 2604.2400000000002
the gradient's not going to settle

2602.24 --> 2607.839
it's because it's going to cause a

2604.24 --> 2607.839
dynamic to happen

2616.72 --> 2624.16
has a tapping altimeter that's hilarious

2621.52 --> 2626.4
now i think these days it's that's kind

2624.16 --> 2629.7599999999998
of replaced by just gps

2626.4 --> 2633.6800000000003
it's a little easier you know gps

2629.76 --> 2637.599
does does knowingly

2633.68 --> 2642.0
it's widely known that gps has the best

2637.599 --> 2644.7200000000003
euclidean database

2642.0 --> 2646.24
like in the world it's the whole thing

2644.72 --> 2649.68
mapped out perfectly in

2646.24 --> 2652.72
a euclidean format which is

2649.68 --> 2663.839
flat so

2652.72 --> 2663.839
yeah that that works much better

2674.31 --> 2677.369
[Music]

2681.52 --> 2693.68
geometric orientation

2690.4 --> 2695.6800000000003
all right now it's not just

2693.68 --> 2697.839
the thing is is that the whole thing can

2695.68 --> 2700.7999999999997
be put together

2697.839 --> 2700.7999999999997
regional wise

2701.68 --> 2708.16
and it's euclidean i just don't know

2704.88 --> 2711.76
myself for sure what the

2708.16 --> 2713.1189999999997
eventual like is it i don't it is like

2711.76 --> 2717.599
the rectangular

2713.119 --> 2720.96
map isn't it so

2717.599 --> 2723.04
i'm still not sure i'd have to like see

2720.96 --> 2724.96
like a visual representation of the

2723.04 --> 2727.2
entire thing but

2724.96 --> 2728.88
i don't know i think the whole thing is

2727.2 --> 2731.7599999999998
rectangular and looping

2728.88 --> 2732.2400000000002
i think it really is and i think that in

2731.76 --> 2735.6800000000003
the end

2732.24 --> 2736.4799999999996
it probably will show i got hints of

2735.68 --> 2741.359
this

2736.48 --> 2743.68
being the case before a while ago

2741.359 --> 2745.2799999999997
by people that were kind of on to that

2743.68 --> 2748.3999999999996
but yeah it was more

2745.28 --> 2750.8
wishy-washy all kinds of things were

2748.4 --> 2752.8
kind of being figured out and

2750.8 --> 2755.119
suggested and there wasn't a lot of

2752.8 --> 2757.3590000000004
structure to it all

2755.119 --> 2758.8
but pretty early on i got the idea that

2757.359 --> 2762.24
yeah all of these

2758.8 --> 2763.44
3d databases including gps including

2762.24 --> 2767.4399999999996
what google has

2763.44 --> 2771.2000000000003
that it's all just a giant euclidean

2767.44 --> 2774.4
3d map of the rectangular

2771.2 --> 2777.4399999999996
earth and that that's basically

2774.4 --> 2780.56
that's literally what the earth is then

2777.44 --> 2780.56
if that's what they use

2786.24 --> 2792.3999999999996
so that's kind of why i tend to not hold

2789.2 --> 2792.3999999999996
on to the disc as much

2800.839 --> 2807.52
also

2802.48 --> 2807.52
oh right random explorer yes some truck

2808.64 --> 2814.839
right i didn't know that mike picked

2812.48 --> 2817.839
that up

2814.839 --> 2817.839
hmm

2829.68 --> 2835.359
yeah incept happy yets don't exist

2832.96 --> 2835.359
indeed

2835.839 --> 2845.839
that's hilarious that you misspelled it

2837.52 --> 2845.839
twice there

2870.839 --> 2873.839
hmm

2881.599 --> 2887.839
all right september

2890.24 --> 2895.9199999999996
all right well george sanford

2893.359 --> 2898.7999999999997
i don't what i don't remember even what

2895.92 --> 2902.8
an altimeter functions like it's so long

2898.8 --> 2902.8
ago since i even last heard of that

2911.2 --> 2917.839
isn't it basically a pressure

2914.4 --> 2920.96
based meter that just reads out

2917.839 --> 2922.48
the official air pressure gradient and

2920.96 --> 2924.64
then determines what the height should

2922.48 --> 2929.839
be or something like that

2924.64 --> 2929.839
is that it

2940.839 --> 2946.7999999999997
hmm

2942.88 --> 2946.8
all right so it's like a modified

2954.839 --> 2957.839
barometer

2968.839 --> 2971.839
so

2978.24 --> 2985.52
yeah gps will be more accurate

2981.28 --> 2988.559
yeah because yeah i get it an altimeter

2985.52 --> 2991.68
but it's basically just a barometer

2988.559 --> 2992.6400000000003
and then with an estimation put on top a

2991.68 --> 2995.359
deduction of

2992.64 --> 2996.72
yeah what altitude that's roughly

2995.359 --> 2998.72
supposed to be

2996.72 --> 3001.2799999999997
but yeah it doesn't seem like very

2998.72 --> 3001.2799999999997
effective

3002.319 --> 3006.8
with the technology that's available

3004.319 --> 3006.8
right now

3007.76 --> 3012.2400000000002
because yeah if you for example just run

3010.319 --> 3013.92
into a storm front or suddenly the

3012.24 --> 3016.64
weather changes around

3013.92 --> 3018.2400000000002
yeah it's gonna just like oh oh yeah you

3016.64 --> 3019.7599999999998
just went down a couple of hundred

3018.24 --> 3021.52
meters or something

3019.76 --> 3023.3590000000004
according to that thing because the

3021.52 --> 3027.359
pressure just changed

3023.359 --> 3029.5989999999997
you know that's but anyway yeah pilots

3027.359 --> 3031.839
probably are well informed about all of

3029.599 --> 3033.6800000000003
that

3031.839 --> 3035.04
that they're basically not gonna look at

3033.68 --> 3036.96
it

3035.04 --> 3038.319
i think they probably i think most

3036.96 --> 3041.359
pilots will probably use

3038.319 --> 3043.2
altimeters in their planes just to see

3041.359 --> 3045.119
like oh the pressure changed

3043.2 --> 3046.48
they're basically just improvising it as

3045.119 --> 3049.2000000000003
a barometer

3046.48 --> 3052.839
that's what i probably would do anyway

3049.2 --> 3054.5589999999997
i'm not a pilot i haven't had pilot

3052.839 --> 3068.319
training

3054.559 --> 3070.559
although i i would be interested too

3068.319 --> 3070.5589999999997
hmm

3077.04 --> 3084.8
yeah well septepi pressure gradient

3081.2 --> 3087.68
is relatively consistent

3084.8 --> 3090.0
as in the pattern of the gradient is

3087.68 --> 3093.04
relatively consistent

3090.0 --> 3095.839
but yeah it is constantly varying

3093.04 --> 3096.72
like on the spot can start to vary

3095.839 --> 3099.04
dramatically

3096.72 --> 3099.839
based on weather conditions hey it it

3099.04 --> 3104.0
varies

3099.839 --> 3104.0
during day and night okay

3104.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
so yeah not that consistent

3120.75 --> 3123.92
[Music]

3127.8 --> 3131.319
[Music]

3136.839 --> 3139.839
hmm

3147.68 --> 3150.8799999999997
the dynamic well yeah the gradient's

3149.599 --> 3153.839
always going to be

3150.88 --> 3154.6400000000003
from low pressure to high pressure like

3153.839 --> 3157.839
that yeah

3154.64 --> 3160.5589999999997
said taffy that's right so

3157.839 --> 3162.5589999999997
what is your point exactly now because

3160.559 --> 3164.2400000000002
we know we know there's a pressure grain

3162.559 --> 3166.6400000000003
i already told you the bigger the

3164.24 --> 3168.4799999999996
container the more distinct the gradient

3166.64 --> 3170.96
of the gas pressure within it

3168.48 --> 3172.2400000000002
the higher the pressure within the

3170.96 --> 3174.319
container

3172.24 --> 3176.0
the more distinct the pressure gradient

3174.319 --> 3179.2799999999997
within the container

3176.0 --> 3182.48
okay and you can all aggravate the any

3179.28 --> 3186.3190000000004
gradient formation by applying

3182.48 --> 3189.2
centrifugal forces for example

3186.319 --> 3191.04
it will even create more gradient

3189.2 --> 3194.96
formation and quicker

3191.04 --> 3198.96
but yeah so there is a gradient

3194.96 --> 3200.079
it's very nice very interesting how that

3198.96 --> 3203.28
works

3200.079 --> 3206.2400000000002
but yeah it is it is explainable because

3203.28 --> 3208.7200000000003
there's relative density

3206.24 --> 3209.5989999999997
so it's logical that a gradient would

3208.72 --> 3211.52
form

3209.599 --> 3212.6400000000003
because not all gases have the same

3211.52 --> 3223.359
density

3212.64 --> 3226.4
and they do seek their equilibrium

3223.359 --> 3229.04
yes it does a dynamic system

3226.4 --> 3230.1600000000003
does explain the consistent vertical

3229.04 --> 3233.359
pressure gradient

3230.16 --> 3236.0789999999997
yes it does again

3233.359 --> 3238.0
relative density you know the the

3236.079 --> 3241.119
pressure the

3238.0 --> 3244.48
the pressure gradient would be even

3241.119 --> 3247.599
more distinct if there was no

3244.48 --> 3249.04
dynamic system if the earth was

3247.599 --> 3252.079
completely dead

3249.04 --> 3252.88
and there was no water it was any water

3252.079 --> 3254.88
was there was

3252.88 --> 3257.599
evaporated yeah the gradient would be

3254.88 --> 3261.119
extremely distinct

3257.599 --> 3263.6800000000003
very exact and the gases would probably

3261.119 --> 3264.48
all start even splitting off because

3263.68 --> 3267.359
there's no

3264.48 --> 3268.079
change no heat change you know it would

3267.359 --> 3271.5989999999997
have to be no

3268.079 --> 3274.6400000000003
sun no stars nothing and then yeah

3271.599 --> 3277.52
extremely distinct pressure gradient

3274.64 --> 3279.52
it's just that because it's dynamic it's

3277.52 --> 3281.04
not that distinct because it also keeps

3279.52 --> 3283.92
mixing up

3281.04 --> 3283.92
and displacing

3289.44 --> 3294.64
yeah downward force you say no no no no

3293.04 --> 3298.319
is that happy

3294.64 --> 3301.1189999999997
no you don't there's no downward force

3298.319 --> 3302.079
there is relative density disequilibrium

3301.119 --> 3307.28
force

3302.079 --> 3310.559
and it goes down and up both

3307.28 --> 3312.799
both of that that's the directions

3310.559 --> 3314.1600000000003
it's not just down not down go boom boom

3312.799 --> 3317.7599999999998
it's down and

3314.16 --> 3319.52
up relative density

3317.76 --> 3323.44
it's not a downward force it's a

3319.52 --> 3327.119
downward and upward force

3323.44 --> 3330.4
and it's purely dependent at the essence

3327.119 --> 3333.52
on the dynamic between an object

3330.4 --> 3336.7200000000003
its density and the medium's density

3333.52 --> 3340.0
in which the object is

3336.72 --> 3340.0
whatever the object may be

3343.119 --> 3347.599
buoyancy is upward for look you can call

3345.68 --> 3350.799
it whatever the [ __ ] you like

3347.599 --> 3355.76
but it's not gravity cost there is no

3350.799 --> 3358.079
downward singular downward force

3355.76 --> 3359.599
gravity isn't even a force there's no

3358.079 --> 3362.6400000000003
hypothesis for it

3359.599 --> 3365.6800000000003
it's all relative density

3362.64 --> 3367.5989999999997
all of it the force is relative density

3365.68 --> 3369.2799999999997
this equilibrium force

3367.599 --> 3370.96
that's what it is scientifically

3369.28 --> 3373.599
provable and repeatable

3370.96 --> 3375.599
if you can't accept it you got a big

3373.599 --> 3376.0
[ __ ] problem you need to grow the

3375.599 --> 3378.1600000000003
[ __ ]

3376.0 --> 3378.16
up

3381.119 --> 3384.96
no i did mention gravity are you slow

3383.599 --> 3387.839
zapped happy

3384.96 --> 3388.799
i just said it what is with ballers

3387.839 --> 3391.92
every time

3388.799 --> 3394.799
i literally say something on camera

3391.92 --> 3395.119
10 seconds later oh notice how he didn't

3394.799 --> 3399.28
said

3395.119 --> 3399.28
yeah i did immediately

3400.96 --> 3404.88
and it's not that you have no proof for

3403.28 --> 3407.76
gravity gravity

3404.88 --> 3409.599
is a concept it's an aberration it's a

3407.76 --> 3414.7200000000003
reification fallacy

3409.599 --> 3418.96
it does not exist in physical reality

3414.72 --> 3422.0789999999997
it's fiction relative density

3418.96 --> 3424.48
does exist it's provable empirically

3422.079 --> 3425.28
repeatable anyone can do it it's very

3424.48 --> 3429.68
easy

3425.28 --> 3434.079
it's not down it's down and up

3429.68 --> 3436.64
that's what that is it's not singular

3434.079 --> 3437.599
one is not a side effect of the other

3436.64 --> 3441.839
it's down

3437.599 --> 3443.119
and up not one direction and the other

3441.839 --> 3446.48
as a side effect no

3443.119 --> 3461.839
it's down and up

3446.48 --> 3461.839
not singular direction

3464.96 --> 3469.359
ah right sept happy sure

3470.319 --> 3475.839
i misread that

3477.44 --> 3480.88
no i don't have sympathy

3482.48 --> 3486.4
i have sympathy when would they pay me

3484.319 --> 3488.16
to have sympathy

3486.4 --> 3491.2000000000003
you want me to have sympathy with you as

3488.16 --> 3503.839
a baller pay me

3491.2 --> 3503.839
i'll simulate sympathy

3512.0 --> 3517.839
what who the hell is that more colored

3520.16 --> 3524.48
alright anyway i'm gonna round out the

3522.24 --> 3524.4799999999996
show

3525.359 --> 3529.7599999999998
so thanks everyone for coming and

3528.24 --> 3535.68
participating in the chat

3529.76 --> 3535.6800000000003
too sympathy is for sale

3539.04 --> 3542.96
right thanks everyone for coming and

3540.799 --> 3545.2
participating in chat

3542.96 --> 3547.68
including the ballers like except happy

3545.2 --> 3550.5589999999997
and tiny womble

3547.68 --> 3552.48
no i get a little agitated sometimes i

3550.559 --> 3555.76
still do appreciate

3552.48 --> 3559.68
yeah things that you do in chat

3555.76 --> 3562.88
thank you for tolerating

3559.68 --> 3565.68
some of my dissatisfaction

3562.88 --> 3567.6800000000003
uh yeah if you like the show then please
