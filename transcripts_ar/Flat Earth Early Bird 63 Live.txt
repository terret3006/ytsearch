3.2 --> 10.679
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.81 --> 16.049
early-bird number 63 I'm your host

10.679 --> 20.85
Arwen and today outside is kind of a

16.049 --> 26.759999999999998
dreary day what yeah good

20.85 --> 28.8
no winds been raining but not at the

26.76 --> 34.64
moment and yeah

28.8 --> 39.35
today I'm fluffy Arwen so I'm just

34.64 --> 43.89
letting the hair loose at the moment

39.35 --> 48.09
yeah today I mean yesterday yesterday

43.89 --> 53.789
was pretty incredible day so much

48.09 --> 58.199000000000005
activity it's just so many very heavy

53.789 --> 63.86
long conversations at at least three of

58.199 --> 68.92999999999999
them and yeah

63.86 --> 72.33
still feel like oh I have to temper my

68.93 --> 76.02000000000001
enthusiastic and mine to enthusiasm of

72.33 --> 78.99
it all and I had literally trouble

76.02 --> 82.64999999999999
sleeping at night because of it because

78.99 --> 85.35
we are when I encounter new people when

82.65 --> 88.89
thrilling things happened I become

85.35 --> 91.30999999999999
really exhilarated and I just I can't go

88.89 --> 91.31
to sleep

95.12 --> 100.28
so it was kind of late and

105.39 --> 111.69
I feel slightly tired but still okay

108.56 --> 116.10000000000001
anyway yeah man

111.69 --> 118.47
I I thought that everything was gonna

116.1 --> 124.28999999999999
calm down a bit yesterday but I was

118.47 --> 127.22
wrong because a person I'm not entirely

124.29 --> 131.78
sure of who it is anyway

127.22 --> 137.43
called David Zurich CK they apparently

131.78 --> 140.42000000000002
donated 50 euros to my paypal completely

137.43 --> 146.54000000000002
out of nowhere I was like what serious

140.42 --> 155.7
damn so yeah thank you David Zurich man

146.54 --> 160.14
that is really really helpful I I am

155.7 --> 161.73
gonna for one buy new gloves with some

160.14 --> 164.92999999999998
of that money it's not gonna take it all

161.73 --> 164.92999999999998
but I'll show you why

169.06 --> 176.03
so these are the current gloves that I

172.22 --> 184.01
use this is my right-wing glove it's

176.03 --> 186.14
still okay here's the left one so I can

184.01 --> 196.25
kind of use a new one if you know what I

186.14 --> 199.76
mean it's totally totally broken worn

196.25 --> 202.58
out I need new ones and I neck I can now

199.76 --> 206.44
actually get it so thank you so much

202.58 --> 206.44000000000003
David suruc for your support

208.069 --> 215.53
it's really appreciated so let's see who

212.93 --> 215.53
is in chat

217.29 --> 225.69
was Allenby who apparently has been

220.29 --> 227.909
unsubscribed again seriously Daniel one

225.69 --> 234.93
of P Mars socks complaining about how

227.909 --> 239.37
his band matrix media low flat stuff

234.93 --> 243.78
earth righteous for Scott curve Looby

239.37 --> 250.89000000000001
loo et and Winfield's and shrew Minotti

243.78 --> 259.28
their earlier overlords Flat Earth

250.89 --> 259.28
hangouts other data flatlines yo

264.36 --> 270.0
this seems to be going somewhere

266.37 --> 273.99
although yeah you might you might see

270.0 --> 279.389
the today's subscription count and yeah

273.99 --> 282.479
I predicted it it would be lower than

279.389 --> 285.659
where I ended up yesterday told you it

282.479 --> 289.87899999999996
was gonna happen let's refresh it up got

285.659 --> 297.539
one more so that's probably gonna be Oh

289.879 --> 298.199
what okay it's Chris MCM thanks for

297.539 --> 303.59
subscribing

298.199 --> 307.849
I guess that even the ballers are

303.59 --> 311.94
feeling the injustice of this weird

307.849 --> 313.44
weird attempt from of youtube to prevent

311.94 --> 316.319
me from getting those thousand

313.44 --> 320.129
subscribers so I guess yeah thanks

316.319 --> 322.05
everyone even though I might not really

320.129 --> 324.719
like you that much thank you for at

322.05 --> 329.219
least supporting me in in this attempt

324.719 --> 331.44
it's really appreciated hey Lisa

329.219 --> 336.75
hello it's a mouse key yeah I saw you

331.44 --> 341.029
yesterday on your life music performance

336.75 --> 341.029
that was really cool was nice

343.719 --> 360.61899999999997
Thank You Vincent Redpath Ragnar Stephan

351.919 --> 363.19899999999996
elderson yep so yeah I had

360.619 --> 367.009
I'll just elaborate a little but what

363.199 --> 370.069
happened after the show yeah I wasn't

367.009 --> 372.819
after the show I called my good friend

370.069 --> 378.219
again I call so many times the librarian

372.819 --> 378.219
told her about that I had actually

379.21 --> 385.60999999999996
mentioned the whole issue about the

381.83 --> 388.099
Amazon rainforest which yeah was in

385.61 --> 391.66900000000004
originated with her and I even also did

388.099 --> 394.459
extra research to basically I trusted

391.669 --> 394.81899999999996
her pretty blindly up to a certain

394.459 --> 398.709
degree

394.819 --> 401.36
up until the level that I know that she

398.709 --> 403.309
she has it right and she has no ill

401.36 --> 404.869
intentions whatsoever I'm pretty damn

403.309 --> 408.83000000000004
sure about that I know her for a very

404.869 --> 413.629
long time very intensely intellectually

408.83 --> 416.68899999999996
and I did some digging and yeah yeah it

413.629 --> 419.53900000000004
was completely correct although although

416.689 --> 422.05
yeah how to interpret it is still

419.539 --> 425.36
somewhat open because yeah even she said

422.05 --> 429.43
that this is president who apparently is

425.36 --> 433.099
racist and sexist and and for real

429.43 --> 437.8
apparently could it be a stunt could it

433.099 --> 440.479
be kind of like a stump Trump stunts

437.8 --> 444.219
triggering social justice warriors but

440.479 --> 447.699
over the top because yeah again if he

444.219 --> 450.08
would act exactly upon all these things

447.699 --> 453.499
literally that would be quite disastrous

450.08 --> 457.039
but maybe he really did it just to get

453.499 --> 459.949
the intention and to oppose the yeah the

457.039 --> 462.86
social justice maniacs that were taking

459.949 --> 465.08000000000004
over Brazil

462.86 --> 468.62
we're pretty much everywhere they they

465.08 --> 473.75
can they try and yeah who knows where

468.62 --> 476.719
it's gonna end up so maybe it'll turn

473.75 --> 484.28
out not to be as terrible as I feared

476.719 --> 485.719
originally but yeah it is and and yeah

484.28 --> 494.21
yesterday I had another conversation

485.719 --> 497.33
about the Tarte Aryans about the mud

494.21 --> 499.87899999999996
flood and it is yeah that was a

497.33 --> 503.06
difficult difficult conversation and it

499.879 --> 505.31
lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes pretty

503.06 --> 508.31
intensely at one point we were like

505.31 --> 512.36
ready to hang up really angry cuz that

508.31 --> 515.06
happens she knows a lot she has learned

512.36 --> 519.349
so many things she's read so many books

515.06 --> 523.25
she studied so many individuals that

519.349 --> 526.5790000000001
wrote books about science in all

523.25 --> 528.949
directions almost and archeology and all

526.579 --> 532.8499999999999
that when I told her about the a giant

528.949 --> 534.949
skeletons Smithsonian is destroying them

532.85 --> 538.85
they still find them she had so much

534.949 --> 542.39
trouble accepting this tried to find a

538.85 --> 544.07
way out but like not that can be that

542.39 --> 546.769
doesn't make any sense because that's so

544.07 --> 548.63
and scientific it's totally against the

546.769 --> 551.23
principles of scientist spirit of

548.63 --> 555.29
science and yeah I agreed with that

551.23 --> 558.29
and yeah eventually had to evade a

555.29 --> 560.54
little yes yeah oh yeah again about the

558.29 --> 561.86
tart Aryans yeah she had a lot of

560.54 --> 567.04
trouble because she had basically

561.86 --> 572.3000000000001
learned that the tart Aryans are like a

567.04 --> 575.0
Mongolian type tribal people and that

572.3 --> 576.5889999999999
contrasts greatly of course with the

575.0 --> 578.76
concept that the tart Aryans may have

576.589 --> 582.389
been a very advanced empire that

578.76 --> 584.88
left and I reason out okay well maybe

582.389 --> 586.98
the tart Aryans that we learn art

584.88 --> 591.959
supposedly the tart Aryans are the ones

586.98 --> 596.1
that stayed behind that might have been

591.959 --> 599.1899999999999
around during those tart Aryans the yeah

596.1 --> 601.44
the the advanced empire but yeah when

599.19 --> 603.389
the others when they stayed behind and

601.44 --> 606.69
now they have been named the terrans

603.389 --> 610.699
basically to cover for the the advanced

606.69 --> 614.6990000000001
empire that left that went away or that

610.699 --> 617.37
that we don't know exactly what happened

614.699 --> 620.04
to them if they moved away or if they

617.37 --> 626.61
just died or disappeared or don't really

620.04 --> 630.93
know it was yeah there's more to figure

626.61 --> 633.87
out and look we can theorize pretty

630.93 --> 636.5699999999999
easily and move the picture from here to

633.87 --> 644.069
there but yeah that friend of mine she

636.57 --> 647.5790000000001
knows so many details reports she's one

644.069 --> 650.25
that really does study like every piece

647.579 --> 652.26
of writing that she can get her hands on

650.25 --> 655.199
involving a subject to get all detail

652.26 --> 659.819
she's that meticulous more meticulous

655.199 --> 663.8599999999999
than I have patients to be but and and

659.819 --> 666.81
that she is such an incredibly valuable

663.86 --> 670.1990000000001
intellectual resource to me because she

666.81 --> 672.2399999999999
goes places but I don't really have the

670.199 --> 675.0889999999999
patience and she's older than me and

672.24 --> 677.1
she's done that so throughout her life

675.089 --> 680.0690000000001
shall she is literally a library of

677.1 --> 682.7090000000001
knowledge to me but yeah she did of

680.069 --> 684.6899999999999
course learn all these things from the

682.709 --> 688.76
knowledge that was allowed to be

684.69 --> 693.35
published that's allowed to be out there

688.76 --> 695.72
and at the same time she's also from our

693.35 --> 698.09
own perspective and that's the most

695.72 --> 699.35
amazing part very well aware that there

698.09 --> 702.0500000000001
is fraud

699.35 --> 704.96
even scientific community and we talked

702.05 --> 709.6999999999999
about that too that the fraud is based

704.96 --> 712.2800000000001
on the necessity to keep your funding

709.7 --> 715.1600000000001
and that it is will often turn out to

712.28 --> 719.63
become politically driven and that even

715.16 --> 722.42
narrative choices will be prioritized

719.63 --> 725.99
over truth in that sense and she

722.42 --> 729.3499999999999
recognized that from self containing

725.99 --> 733.07
standpoint so that's pretty amazing that

729.35 --> 736.34
even though in the bigger picture people

733.07 --> 740.48
can disagree when you look at the

736.34 --> 745.6
smaller details we actually do agree

740.48 --> 749.86
very much and that is interesting for me

745.6 --> 752.87
and then I will try to keep up

749.86 --> 755.69
continue also another subject of course

752.87 --> 757.7
or of course that will would have

755.69 --> 760.19
typically surfaced during that

757.7 --> 764.48
conversation and it did is the whole

760.19 --> 766.7
dinosaurs concept like we basically

764.48 --> 769.01
discussed like yeah our dinosaurs real

766.7 --> 770.9300000000001
and I started out saying no of course

769.01 --> 773.39
not they didn't exist the way they said

770.93 --> 775.37
and she would say yeah but they did find

773.39 --> 781.52
a dinosaurs and they even found a

775.37 --> 784.19
mammoth meet in the ice and yeah I

781.52 --> 787.22
actually elaborated on that like yeah

784.19 --> 790.6300000000001
does that make sense that if we find

787.22 --> 793.99
these things in the in the ice and still

790.63 --> 793.99
carbon wise

794.36 --> 799.94
and analyzable you really think that all

797.81 --> 802.3299999999999
these things are millions of years old

799.94 --> 805.97
you think that's an accurate portrayal

802.33 --> 809.5400000000001
should that be able to work in under any

805.97 --> 813.46
circumstances and dad that's something

809.54 --> 813.4599999999999
that she had to think about for a moment

814.0 --> 820.04
because yeah it seemed much more likely

818.3 --> 822.65
to me that all these things were in the

820.04 --> 825.86
pretty recent past and as an example I

822.65 --> 829.04
said what I think dinosaurs are are just

825.86 --> 832.09
very large reptiles that have been part

829.04 --> 835.01
of this world for a long time and even

832.09 --> 837.95
cultivated perhaps by certain groups of

835.01 --> 843.01
people after the flood and yeah there

837.95 --> 845.45
are some large lizards some horse-sized

843.01 --> 848.39
maybe even elephant sized

845.45 --> 852.0200000000001
lizards that have existed in the not too

848.39 --> 856.61
far past that have all been removed

852.02 --> 859.04
maybe killed or maybe they all died from

856.61 --> 862.3100000000001
the mud flood who knows exactly how it

859.04 --> 864.55
works but yeah that was the picture that

862.31 --> 864.55
I

864.99 --> 871.11
try to hand her and didn't accept it

868.23 --> 873.72
right away but she was very interested

871.11 --> 875.67
in the possibility of it and again of

873.72 --> 879.5600000000001
course very worried because yeah that

875.67 --> 879.56
shows again how much

879.83 --> 887.75
powers-that-be in any era are willing to

883.899 --> 891.23
absolutely annihilate the actual real

887.75 --> 894.709
truth and history to get this slide

891.23 --> 897.0500000000001
Advanta KO advantage in the time to be

894.709 --> 899.149
able to present a story that even though

897.05 --> 900.9799999999999
makes very little sense because the

899.149 --> 902.26
people don't really know the true fall

900.98 --> 905.36
that much

902.26 --> 907.399
they'll just be very happy with the

905.36 --> 909.74
design of the story that's handed to

907.399 --> 913.81
them at the time and that's why they do

909.74 --> 913.8100000000001
that that's why they care so little

913.99 --> 917.44
something to think about

918.529 --> 923.989
and yes she did and while the

921.949 --> 928.929
conversation ended up pretty pretty good

923.989 --> 928.9290000000001
pretty yeah

929.99 --> 936.6
yeah a lot of yeah reaffirming the

933.69 --> 939.089
friendship not getting not splitting up

936.6 --> 940.9200000000001
angry that [ __ ] and that did happen

939.089 --> 943.74
before in the past where we just bumped

940.92 --> 947.91
head so much and we couldn't couldn't

943.74 --> 950.16
stop too much intellectual competition

947.91 --> 952.4699999999999
very much like a polarization flatter

950.16 --> 955.199
versus baller very much like that and

952.47 --> 959.57
that happens in yeah us and we know each

955.199 --> 962.55
other for for a decade very intensely so

959.57 --> 964.6800000000001
yeah I can imagine that even among

962.55 --> 967.8
people that you know very well and that

964.68 --> 971.2199999999999
you will lean upon in a unique way that

967.8 --> 973.5
you don't with other people even even

971.22 --> 976.8000000000001
people like that that are that close can

973.5 --> 979.949
get into a polarized state about things

976.8 --> 981.99
like Flat Earth versus globe and it is

979.949 --> 990.06
very much routed and instinct when that

981.99 --> 995.4300000000001
happens and fascinating again just how

990.06 --> 997.29
that works yeah she is a baller in the

995.43 --> 1001.399
foundation of it but it seems to lead

997.29 --> 1006.949
more on her on the necessity for her to

1001.399 --> 1012.199
actually have some faith in the goodness

1006.949 --> 1015.279
of humanity that's yeah tragic actually

1012.199 --> 1022.25
in a way it is the same kind of tragic

1015.279 --> 1024.709
now if Nativity that I had and I had it

1022.25 --> 1026.81
much worse yeah she still has it

1024.709 --> 1029.5700000000002
somewhat

1026.81 --> 1031.73
where we're all progressing and I think

1029.57 --> 1035.6299999999999
that probably in five years or something

1031.73 --> 1038.69
she might be a lot closer to the

1035.63 --> 1040.25
understanding that I am at concerning

1038.69 --> 1043.22
all these things and they the the

1040.25 --> 1047.0
politics in the past and see the bad it

1043.22 --> 1050.9
really is that bad that complicated

1047.0 --> 1054.23
matter of perspective so yeah very very

1050.9 --> 1056.93
intense conversation one hour 45 minutes

1054.23 --> 1060.8
and the entire thing see it wasn't Dutch

1056.93 --> 1063.47
she is Dutch but I felt like Oh God

1060.8 --> 1065.81
we had told her like oh my god we should

1063.47 --> 1068.0
really like record one of these

1065.81 --> 1070.79
conversations one time and then

1068.0 --> 1074.24
afterwards you see like okay it's this

1070.79 --> 1077.6299999999999
okay - are you okay if I put this out

1074.24 --> 1080.72
because it is we have very very intense

1077.63 --> 1083.75
conversation it is like me when I'm

1080.72 --> 1086.8700000000001
really into the moment really doing

1083.75 --> 1088.82
seeing heavy stuff and that being

1086.87 --> 1091.61
reciprocated up back and forth back and

1088.82 --> 1094.01
forth very intense so yeah it's very

1091.61 --> 1095.6899999999998
interesting to see that happen and I

1094.01 --> 1099.02
thought I would love to have that

1095.69 --> 1102.8300000000002
recorded one time and if she is okay

1099.02 --> 1105.86
with it if if the moment is right yeah

1102.83 --> 1110.27
and that was not the last of it that was

1105.86 --> 1113.2299999999998
just the the first intense conversation

1110.27 --> 1113.23
because after that

1115.72 --> 1122.71
good conversation with my dad didn't

1118.06 --> 1126.52
last that long didn't me too and after

1122.71 --> 1127.93
that I went to the coffee shop and I

1126.52 --> 1129.52
thought ok I'm just gonna pick it up get

1127.93 --> 1132.0700000000002
out of here cousin was rainin didn't

1129.52 --> 1134.23
really feel like hanging around and I

1132.07 --> 1141.4299999999998
suddenly bumped into a familiar face

1134.23 --> 1145.72
over there it's a blind man that I met

1141.43 --> 1148.63
in October last last year it was very

1145.72 --> 1151.54
amazing I talked about it on the show I

1148.63 --> 1155.98
think the debates back then a guy that

1151.54 --> 1158.8
is blind but he knows he is very very

1155.98 --> 1160.6
wise and his memory is excellent he

1158.8 --> 1162.79
needs it he needs it to orient that he

1160.6 --> 1165.28
needs his memory for everything and that

1162.79 --> 1167.8
guy knows Flat Earth just doesn't talk

1165.28 --> 1168.7
about as he knows a people do with it

1167.8 --> 1172.45
and

1168.7 --> 1175.0900000000001
can't afford to the risk hostilities but

1172.45 --> 1176.71
he knows it and well I talked with him

1175.09 --> 1180.04
it's like I'm good to see you again and

1176.71 --> 1183.28
and then suddenly a guy that I've never

1180.04 --> 1186.61
seen before just said okay I'm gonna sit

1183.28 --> 1189.04
with you guys that's okay okay that's

1186.61 --> 1192.6999999999998
something that rarely happens with with

1189.04 --> 1195.28
me people just come and sit with me to

1192.7 --> 1196.48
join a conversation so I was like okay

1195.28 --> 1200.95
who's this guy

1196.48 --> 1206.05
it seems very nice very energetic guy

1200.95 --> 1208.45
and apparently this guy was very

1206.05 --> 1211.48
interested in the occult II started

1208.45 --> 1214.78
about it on his own volition and he was

1211.48 --> 1218.35
very especially fixated himself on

1214.78 --> 1220.78
geometry and on geometry and he showed

1218.35 --> 1226.6
some of what he was working on in his

1220.78 --> 1230.97
notebooks like this yes typical number

1226.6 --> 1235.24
puzzles and just doing that doing the

1230.97 --> 1237.25
the new do numerical alchemy this guy

1235.24 --> 1239.38
was intensely into that and he said he

1237.25 --> 1245.8
was just hah being with that for over

1239.38 --> 1248.7700000000002
ten years okay this guy is like he came

1245.8 --> 1252.1499999999999
to me with the feeling like can you help

1248.77 --> 1254.59
me progress I don't know if he knew it

1252.15 --> 1257.0500000000002
subconsciously but that is what his

1254.59 --> 1262.6899999999998
subconscious was telling me like I am

1257.05 --> 1265.51
ready so yeah I pretty much rolled all

1262.69 --> 1268.81
of it including the things that I don't

1265.51 --> 1272.74
even talk about in public all on to him

1268.81 --> 1276.97
and it seems like he this guy has heard

1272.74 --> 1278.3700000000001
many things because I yeah no matter

1276.97 --> 1281.91
what I really

1278.37 --> 1285.05
Hevy how intense and even scary

1281.91 --> 1288.059
I approached things and presented them

1285.05 --> 1290.7
my own personal interpretations of my

1288.059 --> 1293.16
vision for example and the conclusions

1290.7 --> 1296.7
that I've drawn and how absurdly complex

1293.16 --> 1300.0
they really are and he got it

1296.7 --> 1302.19
you just got it it's like that rarely

1300.0 --> 1305.809
happens person that I just meet in the

1302.19 --> 1308.91
spot this is pretty special

1305.809 --> 1312.27
and I talked about a path of Christ also

1308.91 --> 1313.89
and the Bible and mention yeah look but

1312.27 --> 1315.57
it's also the Sun and they said yeah

1313.89 --> 1318.0590000000002
that's the Gnostic approach it's all

1315.57 --> 1323.24
true all of it all these things are all

1318.059 --> 1323.24
interwoven like an interdimensional

1323.63 --> 1329.8090000000002
multi-dimensional writing pattern that

1326.97 --> 1333.179
is one thing that means all these

1329.809 --> 1336.72
separates apparently contrasting things

1333.179 --> 1339.3300000000002
simultaneously and the further you see

1336.72 --> 1342.45
the sharper your wisdom becomes the more

1339.33 --> 1347.99
you see how it all fits and nothing

1342.45 --> 1351.1200000000001
really does contradict it is your inner

1347.99 --> 1355.05
interpretation and limitedness that

1351.12 --> 1358.4399999999998
tends to make you think like a personal

1355.05 --> 1360.78
cultural process based on ego that it is

1358.44 --> 1365.3600000000001
contrasting while in reality it's not

1360.78 --> 1370.83
really it's just interconnected in a way

1365.36 --> 1373.3799999999999
that is not obvious to that level you

1370.83 --> 1376.35
really have to see be able to see

1373.38 --> 1378.24
further to realize that so yeah we

1376.35 --> 1380.28
talked about wisdom and the inside and

1378.24 --> 1382.8
sharpening of intuition in the path and

1380.28 --> 1384.01
also about the Freemasons

1382.8 --> 1386.32
it was very interested in

1384.01 --> 1390.75
yes and how are you freemason and a show

1386.32 --> 1393.97
to my ring now how that came to being

1390.75 --> 1396.1
but I yeah didn't even realize what I

1393.97 --> 1398.68
was making at the time I I did realize

1396.1 --> 1401.4699999999998
but they didn't know and that eventually

1398.68 --> 1404.8
I figured it out after it was made like

1401.47 --> 1408.58
whoa what one do I have here and that

1404.8 --> 1410.86
some of these things work like this and

1408.58 --> 1414.1899999999998
yeah great guy I gave him my youtube

1410.86 --> 1417.4199999999998
channel also I actually mentioned in the

1414.19 --> 1421.51
I think it was 3 hours 3 our

1417.42 --> 1423.46
conversation with this guy and and the

1421.51 --> 1426.81
other black guy as well he was sitting

1423.46 --> 1430.3600000000001
there more passive just listening

1426.81 --> 1433.57
eventually and but I didn't mention the

1430.36 --> 1436.3
word flattered at a single time I did my

1433.57 --> 1439.9199999999998
trip and why did I do that because the

1436.3 --> 1442.6
blind guy he knew that guy very well and

1439.92 --> 1445.1200000000001
and I asked him when the guy went away

1442.6 --> 1446.8899999999999
for a second like yeah how is he with

1445.12 --> 1451.75
flattered how does he respond to that

1446.89 --> 1455.14
and the guy said yeah he doesn't believe

1451.75 --> 1459.01
it he thinks it's impossible so yeah I

1455.14 --> 1461.5300000000002
was good to not bring that up yet I

1459.01 --> 1464.19
talked about absolutely everything

1461.53 --> 1465.94
absolutely are in the psychology of

1464.19 --> 1468.1000000000001
everything we're dealing with it

1465.94 --> 1471.04
psychology of the multi-level narrative

1468.1 --> 1475.33
the compartmentalization power structure

1471.04 --> 1482.23
and the inherent need for the human

1475.33 --> 1484.03
individual to limit your oversight

1482.23 --> 1485.95
to simplify it to make it more

1484.03 --> 1488.83
comfortable for yourself to deal with

1485.95 --> 1492.22
the stresses these things everything and

1488.83 --> 1495.24
the religious cultural responds the lies

1492.22 --> 1498.07
in education I talked about everything

1495.24 --> 1500.74
science the flaws in science mathematics

1498.07 --> 1502.75
how it's not I started out with that

1500.74 --> 1505.99
actually how mathematics is not reality

1502.75 --> 1508.51
and why and he started to have the

1505.99 --> 1511.27
typical math is reality response with

1508.51 --> 1513.94
yeah there are some parts that can make

1511.27 --> 1517.33
sense but you can compensate that with

1513.94 --> 1519.43
these others parts so I tell them yeah

1517.33 --> 1523.24
that's a misconception because the

1519.43 --> 1527.14
foundation of math is that it is not

1523.24 --> 1530.26
reality it is conceptual it is a tool

1527.14 --> 1533.92
and everything you do with math the

1530.26 --> 1536.94
actual math itself is in your mind that

1533.92 --> 1543.7
is the only place it really does exist

1536.94 --> 1549.8500000000001
really because the physical world is not

1543.7 --> 1551.74
math can be interpreted with math but

1549.85 --> 1554.59
yeah that interpretation within your

1551.74 --> 1556.42
mind can then go directions that made

1554.59 --> 1558.8799999999999
mathematically be possible that in

1556.42 --> 1561.5500000000002
reality are not possible so I explained

1558.88 --> 1566.17
that to him needed to because he was

1561.55 --> 1568.8999999999999
very much into jima geometry and and all

1566.17 --> 1571.0600000000002
that so it's one important lesson I

1568.9 --> 1573.25
thought that he would need to realize to

1571.06 --> 1575.9199999999998
keep himself grounded in reality

1573.25 --> 1578.32
and that worked so yeah long

1575.92 --> 1578.95
conversation over three hours I can

1578.32 --> 1583.6899999999998
barely

1578.95 --> 1585.809
remember what we all talked about but

1583.69 --> 1588.76
yeah he did get it

1585.809 --> 1590.86
he was also wondering about the biblical

1588.76 --> 1592.929
predictions and the Freemason

1590.86 --> 1595.4499999999998
interpretation and yeah

1592.929 --> 1601.919
is there a Christ coming back and how

1595.45 --> 1605.6490000000001
and how should we see that and now no

1601.919 --> 1608.289
yes yes Evan I did not do the magic

1605.649 --> 1610.529
mushrooms and even he nothing of the

1608.289 --> 1610.529
sort

1613.11 --> 1622.59
no thank you very much good

1618.279 --> 1622.59
conversations heavy conversations so

1623.22 --> 1630.58
yeah I gave him the youtube link to my

1627.37 --> 1633.85
channel are also Martin lead given to

1630.58 --> 1636.57
Martin leeches because yeah I thought

1633.85 --> 1639.85
that guy is gonna just blow his mind

1636.57 --> 1641.83
watching just the slide shows that

1639.85 --> 1646.1689999999999
Martin did gas to offer all these things

1641.83 --> 1650.9189999999999
would typically interest him a lot and

1646.169 --> 1654.88
yeah it might be able to suppress his

1650.919 --> 1657.69
Flat Earth doubts and just look at that

1654.88 --> 1657.69
in that way

1665.37 --> 1668.12
all right

1681.84 --> 1690.99
well agra dwells whether it be possible

1688.53 --> 1694.44
on a flat earth on the or globe yeah

1690.99 --> 1698.79
those are d that deeper arguments i

1694.44 --> 1703.79
guess are not there points that do make

1698.79 --> 1703.79
sense but

1705.44 --> 1711.53
yeah there sounds kind of weird there's

1708.56 --> 1714.8
just more to Flat Earth than just the

1711.53 --> 1718.37
shape of the earth there is the

1714.8 --> 1721.9099999999999
realization that there is lies about our

1718.37 --> 1724.82
reality in our past and I think that is

1721.91 --> 1727.5800000000002
the most important lesson to learn out

1724.82 --> 1730.1599999999999
of it and I personally think that even

1727.58 --> 1735.23
the shape of the earth is secondary to

1730.16 --> 1738.53
that realization because that is the

1735.23 --> 1741.7
realization that hits hardest and that

1738.53 --> 1745.07
you learn the most from when it does

1741.7 --> 1750.17
that's what sharpens you the most so

1745.07 --> 1756.02
let's see right I still have 935

1750.17 --> 1761.1200000000001
subscribers yeah isn't that something

1756.02 --> 1764.99
I remember ending up at 944 yesterday or

1761.12 --> 1769.2099999999998
something anyway it went back down way

1764.99 --> 1769.21
back down and then a little up again

1771.68 --> 1778.96
so it's a mess Cheers

1780.98 --> 1784.0
Yeah right

1784.279 --> 1795.35
interesting okay

1792.37 --> 1799.58
mmm yeah seven just subscribe to my

1795.35 --> 1801.83
channel no I just timed them out right

1799.58 --> 1805.519
maybe they feel they need to earn the

1801.83 --> 1808.61
right to troll maybe there's something

1805.519 --> 1812.179
to it maybe I will allow a limited

1808.61 --> 1817.07
amount of Tralee limited limited amount

1812.179 --> 1819.3700000000001
if you subscribe to my channel but don't

1817.07 --> 1819.37
push it

1820.059 --> 1826.73
and also keep checking if you're still

1824.179 --> 1829.0700000000002
subscribed to my channel because yeah

1826.73 --> 1831.08
it's obvious Allenby just mentioned he

1829.07 --> 1834.769
was not subscribed anymore while he

1831.08 --> 1838.33
clearly remembered being subscribed yeah

1834.769 --> 1838.33
other people as well so

1840.929 --> 1847.049
alright Obama calls as Google is AI is

1845.129 --> 1850.9089999999999
messing everything up well is that

1847.049 --> 1853.799
messing up or is it deliberate is it I

1850.909 --> 1856.3490000000002
don't think it's just sheer chaos like

1853.799 --> 1858.389
oh oh my for some reason it just doesn't

1856.349 --> 1861.33
work well if that was the case then

1858.389 --> 1863.4289999999999
probably almost everyone would be

1861.33 --> 1866.899
experiencing exactly these types of

1863.429 --> 1870.259
weirds subscriber fluctuations and I

1866.899 --> 1875.849
don't see any other accounts any other

1870.259 --> 1878.279
youtubers that have it like this so I'm

1875.849 --> 1879.96
probably not the only one maybe I'm the

1878.279 --> 1885.749
only one that's now focusing my

1879.96 --> 1888.21
attention on it but yeah I don't know

1885.749 --> 1891.539
anyone that just has this weird

1888.21 --> 1897.1490000000001
subscriber fluctuation and thus that's

1891.539 --> 1900.71
why I have it now as a as a life part of

1897.149 --> 1903.7189999999998
the show so you can see it fluctuate

1900.71 --> 1905.969
although yeah it's not literally live I

1903.719 --> 1908.76
have to refresh the page like this every

1905.969 --> 1912.77
time I want to check it

1908.76 --> 1912.77
sometimes pop over it

1924.059 --> 1927.529
ah anyway

1927.86 --> 1936.35
yeah this the whole thing with all the

1932.96 --> 1938.0900000000001
donations sounds so weird and kind of

1936.35 --> 1941.3899999999999
embarrassing that money would have so

1938.09 --> 1949.33
much influence but it is really such a

1941.39 --> 1952.8200000000002
relief like so many people and they have

1949.33 --> 1957.1689999999999
properly integrated in society and they

1952.82 --> 1959.57
do have jobs and do have yeah all that

1957.169 --> 1964.3090000000002
the more money and they think oh yeah

1959.57 --> 1967.6689999999999
sure you know what I can miss this well

1964.309 --> 1970.1589999999999
I'm not really like that because I have

1967.669 --> 1975.5
been poor and that's not an exaggeration

1970.159 --> 1978.1390000000001
I have been poor for a while and yeah

1975.5 --> 1980.36
I'm not really blaming anybody else for

1978.139 --> 1984.62
it but that's just the way that it is

1980.36 --> 1986.87
right now and I have been wanting to

1984.62 --> 1988.82
change it but it's just it's proven not

1986.87 --> 1992.12
to be that easy and I've tried and I've

1988.82 --> 1995.48
been going nuts over by first off

1992.12 --> 1996.79
frustration for not really succeeding at

1995.48 --> 2000.53
it

1996.79 --> 2003.1689999999999
and so

2000.53 --> 2006.9089999999999
this this whole thing does mean yeah

2003.169 --> 2011.96
this these people donations give me a

2006.909 --> 2017.63
substantial amount of hope that I could

2011.96 --> 2022.1000000000001
actually do this and survive not just

2017.63 --> 2027.0390000000002
put all my energy in it and end up with

2022.1 --> 2031.1299999999999
lots of hangouts reputation and lore and

2027.039 --> 2032.84
still be freaking poor and stay that way

2031.13 --> 2035.8400000000001
because I don't want this you know i

2032.84 --> 2039.98
I've gotten relatively good at it I'm

2035.84 --> 2044.24
really tight with my spending I only get

2039.98 --> 2049.54
the necessities mostly and I don't throw

2044.24 --> 2052.159
away money on just impulsive things

2049.54 --> 2054.32
except during Christmastime because it

2052.159 --> 2057.8
just can't stop it when that happens but

2054.32 --> 2059.6290000000004
even then I just my limits and I just

2057.8 --> 2062.659
don't spend a lot of money at once I

2059.629 --> 2065.54
rarely spend more than 20 euros at a

2062.659 --> 2068.659
time ever Rani

2065.54 --> 2073.429
just so you know so yeah 50 years is a

2068.659 --> 2076.82
damn how big number for me like I guess

2073.429 --> 2081.9500000000003
that 50 euros to me is what could be

2076.82 --> 2084.1690000000003
like a thousand euros to the to the

2081.95 --> 2086.75
average lower middle-class working

2084.169 --> 2091.27
person that's how it feels to me it's

2086.75 --> 2093.909
big and I can do a lot of good with it

2091.27 --> 2096.73
again thank you so much and if anybody

2093.909 --> 2100.0
else out there feels that they could

2096.73 --> 2103.09
contribute to our win here and help me

2100.0 --> 2105.85
improve my situation and the show too

2103.09 --> 2108.4900000000002
because yeah I do have plans I do have

2105.85 --> 2112.54
plans to actually get a mobile and do

2108.49 --> 2116.6499999999996
under out things to actually get at p900

2112.54 --> 2119.2599999999998
or p1000 and do some real cool moon

2116.65 --> 2121.119
footage and horizon footage isn't

2119.26 --> 2124.21
traveling maybe to the coast here in the

2121.119 --> 2128.05
Netherlands and Phil the islands in the

2124.21 --> 2129.55
distance we have some islands on several

2128.05 --> 2131.53
types of distances so there might be

2129.55 --> 2133.75
some interesting points where I can test

2131.53 --> 2136.6800000000003
out how far I can see on a clear day

2133.75 --> 2141.61
some islands are bound to be visible

2136.68 --> 2143.56
pretty close even under foggy conditions

2141.61 --> 2146.4700000000003
because it's really not that far away

2143.56 --> 2149.11
and other islands are substantially

2146.47 --> 2152.08
further away so if I get the right angle

2149.11 --> 2154.869
on the land then you could potentially

2152.08 --> 2156.97
see like a hill over here and then

2154.869 --> 2159.33
islands over there and getting smaller

2156.97 --> 2163.45
and smaller I'm just wondering how far

2159.33 --> 2166.59
could you really get with a p900

2163.45 --> 2170.08
I'd love to test this out so yeah I too

2166.59 --> 2172.15
want to do field work can't do it in

2170.08 --> 2176.16
this state I really can only do that

2172.15 --> 2176.1600000000003
with your support

2176.17 --> 2181.329
and that can either be direct donations

2178.329 --> 2187.059
which are absolutely appreciated very

2181.329 --> 2192.01
thankful and hey I am even willing up to

2187.059 --> 2195.7900000000004
a certain degree to say okay if you want

2192.01 --> 2198.5200000000004
to donate for a specific reason that is

2195.79 --> 2200.349
not like oh you have to act like a cloud

2198.52 --> 2203.65
or something but like hey I want

2200.349 --> 2206.88
something specific then I will

2203.65 --> 2210.04
definitely consider any request

2206.88 --> 2216.04
yeah that would come with that so I am

2210.04 --> 2216.549
open ya to deliver let's just say it

2216.04 --> 2219.4
like that

2216.549 --> 2221.619
and yeah of course one another way

2219.4 --> 2224.589
besides donations to get there is to get

2221.619 --> 2227.9500000000003
those thousand subscribers if YouTube

2224.589 --> 2229.9
allows it so please yeah please do

2227.95 --> 2233.47
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

2229.9 --> 2236.71
already and if you have please check if

2233.47 --> 2239.589
you still are because YouTube has proven

2236.71 --> 2242.859
by many people in check does and

2239.589 --> 2247.0
subscribe real accounts without telling

2242.859 --> 2250.5099999999998
them so help me out let's get this

2247.0 --> 2253.319
channel two thousand subscribers and see

2250.51 --> 2256.3190000000004
if I can monetize things and move on

2253.319 --> 2256.319
move

2256.599 --> 2262.739
and prove the show so

2262.819 --> 2269.479
alright flatlander yeah I do have a job

2265.939 --> 2271.729
not that big it's kind of stupid more a

2269.479 --> 2275.5389999999998
voluntary job than the real job because

2271.729 --> 2280.339
yeah I'm not making absolutely nothing

2275.539 --> 2284.2690000000002
on it but yeah I consider this a job too

2280.339 --> 2287.029
I consider all my actions almost all of

2284.269 --> 2290.029
it a job every time I communicate I am

2287.029 --> 2297.069
in teacher mode I'm always trying to do

2290.029 --> 2297.069
that and in that sense my life is my job

2297.459 --> 2305.839
but yeah it would be nice to have more

2301.13 --> 2309.829
financial self-sufficiency but I'm not

2305.839 --> 2315.069
gonna twist myself into a corner to get

2309.829 --> 2319.039
that done and in the process disable my

2315.069 --> 2320.8089999999997
my talents my the things that I am

2319.039 --> 2324.0490000000004
really good at doing that I need to be

2320.809 --> 2326.2690000000002
doing in this world so it's I'm gonna

2324.049 --> 2328.339
have to find a middle road in all of

2326.269 --> 2332.029
this and they're still working on it and

2328.339 --> 2336.589
I think that yeah this show YouTube and

2332.029 --> 2340.059
you guys are a part of that a part of

2336.589 --> 2340.0589999999997
this option that I can go

2350.35 --> 2355.96
yeah I I thought of getting a job I've

2353.11 --> 2358.3
thought about it a lot and I thought

2355.96 --> 2363.39
that if I do that then there wouldn't be

2358.3 --> 2367.21
an early bird show anymore okay so yeah

2363.39 --> 2370.5899999999997
unless that job is extremely potent for

2367.21 --> 2374.35
me if it is not a shitty job between

2370.59 --> 2378.9700000000003
unmotivated people doing useless stuff

2374.35 --> 2381.5499999999997
making junk okay I'm not gonna do that

2378.97 --> 2384.6099999999997
if I want a job then it has to be

2381.55 --> 2388.0600000000004
something real that really helps me and

2384.61 --> 2390.55
I explain this even to the local

2388.06 --> 2394.11
government and people here through the

2390.55 --> 2396.46
socialist system trying to help me get

2394.11 --> 2398.61
financial self-sufficiency because they

2396.46 --> 2405.4
do help here they really do their best

2398.61 --> 2407.59
and that includes anything education

2405.4 --> 2411.4900000000002
related that might be required for it

2407.59 --> 2413.9500000000003
because for example I have shown them

2411.49 --> 2417.6899999999996
that I have a wide interest to actually

2413.95 --> 2421.8399999999997
be a manager and that sounds kind of odd

2417.69 --> 2426.88
but I feel like yeah I I could do that I

2421.84 --> 2430.0
could like run a company you make

2426.88 --> 2433.63
company decisions and bail us out right

2430.0 --> 2435.82
or at least try to do that and learn

2433.63 --> 2439.42
about how it really works in this world

2435.82 --> 2442.48
and what the maneuvering room is and how

2439.42 --> 2445.65
much can I maneuver to try to create

2442.48 --> 2445.65
something better

2445.78 --> 2450.25
is that doable all these things I need

2448.24 --> 2452.7299999999996
to learn I need to learn by engaging and

2450.25 --> 2457.15
I want to try it out and I told them and

2452.73 --> 2458.62
yeah I think they are looking helping me

2457.15 --> 2461.56
look I don't know we're really where to

2458.62 --> 2463.99
look because yeah every time I try to

2461.56 --> 2465.49
look at new jobs is yeah of course it's

2463.99 --> 2467.14
like oh yeah we need somebody with 20

2465.49 --> 2468.9399999999996
years experience in addition this and

2467.14 --> 2471.37
blah blah blah blah blah yeah I don't

2468.94 --> 2474.46
have that so that's nothing to be the

2471.37 --> 2477.22
way to do it for me so we're figuring

2474.46 --> 2481.7200000000003
that out and yeah Here I am on YouTube

2477.22 --> 2484.0299999999997
this is a career right now and yeah I

2481.72 --> 2486.52
can say that I have made money out of it

2484.03 --> 2491.8
because of it that I wouldn't have made

2486.52 --> 2496.84
if I didn't do this so yeah this is a

2491.8 --> 2498.8700000000003
job for me really it is I can call it

2496.84 --> 2498.8700000000003
that

2504.1 --> 2510.47
mm no what a lovely opportunity I've

2507.2 --> 2513.6699999999996
been waiting for you to pop in chat so I

2510.47 --> 2513.6699999999996
could ban you

2520.079 --> 2525.4700000000003
unbanned you some time ago but

2522.12 --> 2525.47
yeah same old same old

2535.78 --> 2541.8500000000004
so Wow oh my god I can't believe that

2539.66 --> 2547.43
I'm already talking for almost 45

2541.85 --> 2549.92
minutes how time is flown well if you

2547.43 --> 2552.3199999999997
consider that this to me has been very

2549.92 --> 2554.7200000000003
quickly then you can probably imagine

2552.32 --> 2556.67
how I would have a conversation for

2554.72 --> 2562.9599999999996
three hours straight and just be like

2556.67 --> 2562.96
what three hours later what the anyway

2564.04 --> 2570.23
Jesus

2565.78 --> 2574.3100000000004
okay Constance I gave her the link and

2570.23 --> 2580.09
she's can't come on the instructions

2574.31 --> 2583.37
aren't jiving with Chrome well don't try

2580.09 --> 2585.94
Internet Explorer the only thing that

2583.37 --> 2585.94
works would be

2602.95 --> 2607.47
anyway maybe maybe

2609.759 --> 2620.259
okay yeah maybe she will install this

2614.239 --> 2620.259
and Joey

2629.06 --> 2637.22
I hope to see her will be nice you know

2632.65 --> 2639.2000000000003
third time should be a charm or

2637.22 --> 2643.6699999999996
otherwise mostarda I'm gonna spread a

2639.2 --> 2645.89
rumor that that

2643.67 --> 2649.7000000000003
yeah Constance has a curse that she

2645.89 --> 2652.19
despite her will and intentions is

2649.7 --> 2657.89
enabled to come on the Flat Earth

2652.19 --> 2663.9500000000003
early bird show right my hairdo yeah

2657.89 --> 2666.7999999999997
yeah my hair is fluffy today you know I

2663.95 --> 2673.6099999999997
could put it in like the way I usually

2666.8 --> 2675.17
do but yeah it's gonna be just fluffy

2673.61 --> 2677.63
all over the place so I'm just gonna

2675.17 --> 2680.9
leave it like this and yeah now you can

2677.63 --> 2683.38
see you know it's not it's really not

2680.9 --> 2683.38
that bad

2685.759 --> 2695.22
see I have hair and I am almost 40 not

2691.349 --> 2698.099
at 39 so it's really not that bad my

2695.22 --> 2702.4199999999996
issue it really is is that my hair is

2698.099 --> 2705.569
just thin and yeah that's janae I

2702.42 --> 2708.539
inherited that from my mother it's thin

2705.569 --> 2711.72
and that's why one could interpret like

2708.539 --> 2715.4700000000003
you're balding no I'm not falling it's

2711.72 --> 2716.6699999999996
been literally exactly like this for 20

2715.47 --> 2722.7889999999998
years

2716.67 --> 2725.88
okay on my school's in my education

2722.789 --> 2728.4300000000003
people told me oh look like two dentally

2725.88 --> 2730.0190000000002
the ones that didn't like me I didn't

2728.43 --> 2732.21
like the way I look I said oh look at

2730.019 --> 2737.16
you oh you're gonna grow bold you know

2732.21 --> 2738.21
like shut the hell up no it's like that

2737.16 --> 2741.0589999999997
it's always been like that

2738.21 --> 2744.299
so that's just my hairline that's the

2741.059 --> 2747.2690000000002
way my hair works it's just thin and

2744.299 --> 2750.63
it's always husband and I've never had

2747.269 --> 2753.18
any decoy it's really thick hair well

2750.63 --> 2755.849
look at my dad he does he does have that

2753.18 --> 2757.589
type of hair I don't my hair is thin

2755.849 --> 2760.799
it's because of my mother

2757.589 --> 2764.099
and so my brother has the same type of

2760.799 --> 2764.999
hair and the same type of effect it's

2764.099 --> 2768.589
just the way it is

2764.999 --> 2768.589
I'm not balding thank God

2769.07 --> 2775.4
thank the elves else dump all

2780.45 --> 2788.3999999999996
yeah I like that reptilian Overlord says

2785.21 --> 2791.76
bald is just a solar panel for a sex

2788.4 --> 2794.4
machine hilarious

2791.76 --> 2797.73
yeah the funny thing is is that if you'd

2794.4 --> 2800.94
look into why people why men do some men

2797.73 --> 2804.66
a lot of men do get gold it is because

2800.94 --> 2807.09
those certain types of hair those

2804.66 --> 2810.12
locations those types of hair are

2807.09 --> 2813.96
influenced and actually destroyed by

2810.12 --> 2817.17
testosterone so it's very interesting if

2813.96 --> 2820.38
you look for example typical Italians or

2817.17 --> 2823.91
Spanish the men tend to get really bold

2820.38 --> 2828.06
because they have a lot of testosterone

2823.91 --> 2831.24
passionate and furious and intense

2828.06 --> 2833.52
people and these people the intense ones

2831.24 --> 2837.33
they tend to get both it's because they

2833.52 --> 2840.6
have a lot of testosterone and yeah that

2837.33 --> 2843.09
that those hair locations they can't

2840.6 --> 2845.5499999999997
stand it so they grow bald because of it

2843.09 --> 2848.79
but yeah they will be indeed sex

2845.55 --> 2850.8900000000003
machines they can be if they're like

2848.79 --> 2857.89
that so that's actually true what he

2850.89 --> 2863.469
said it's funny isn't it now

2857.89 --> 2869.16
I have to admit I am NOT like that to

2863.469 --> 2869.16
that level but yeah

2869.67 --> 2879.02
idea I do have the let's just say I do

2874.14 --> 2882.83
have a sex machine inside of me but I I

2879.02 --> 2889.5
just apply it

2882.83 --> 2892.35
yeah I've meticulously and I save it for

2889.5 --> 2896.16
a special occasion because I am just

2892.35 --> 2898.56
naturally not really good at superficial

2896.16 --> 2900.75
sex it's actually damaging to me and

2898.56 --> 2903.0
yeah I tried it out I had a period when

2900.75 --> 2905.72
I was just literally [ __ ] around and

2903.0 --> 2909.84
that was very unhealthy for me

2905.72 --> 2913.3799999999997
spiritually it really was but what I am

2909.84 --> 2916.23
good at is once I really engage in in a

2913.38 --> 2918.0
real relation and it is mutual that is

2916.23 --> 2919.29
when the magic happens now everybody of

2918.0 --> 2921.45
course knows this from their own

2919.29 --> 2923.82
experiences if they had a real love

2921.45 --> 2926.64
relationship the magic does happen well

2923.82 --> 2930.4500000000003
it happens a lot more with me really

2926.64 --> 2938.5299999999997
because that is when the the angel comes

2930.45 --> 2942.7599999999998
out when the love mania comes out so

2938.53 --> 2946.42
yeah I might not be a typical Baldy sex

2942.76 --> 2952.5600000000004
machine that just screws around and but

2946.42 --> 2952.56
yeah I do I do know my way around

2954.82 --> 2963.73
when the time is their next topic right

2959.08 --> 2974.24
hey Nathan good afternoon

2963.73 --> 2977.08
chocolate saying be 900 coolpix so yeah

2974.24 --> 2977.08
anyway

2981.94 --> 2986.75
was funny I was looking at the Horry

2984.349 --> 2988.789
sheet show like half an hour before the

2986.75 --> 2991.01
show started and was still going for

2988.789 --> 2995.8590000000004
like more than four hours I've been up

2991.01 --> 3000.94
all night sitting at 70 beer Jesus dude

2995.859 --> 3004.9
this but man yeah he called random

3000.94 --> 3019.839
people and one chick on that last time

3004.9 --> 3022.2690000000002
she was hot so yeah it's not like I

3019.839 --> 3024.94
don't find really cute women attractive

3022.269 --> 3030.839
but yeah I guess mostly because of my ex

3024.94 --> 3036.88
I have been very spoiled she was amazing

3030.839 --> 3040.089
really really amazing and on the other

3036.88 --> 3043.2400000000002
hand I still do realize that

3040.089 --> 3046.359
and please don't interpret this as me

3043.24 --> 3049.839
being sexist or something or not too

3046.359 --> 3052.99
sexist at least but within the nine but

3049.839 --> 3055.66
yeah there's a lot of chicks that aren't

3052.99 --> 3058.6499999999996
really super pretty super sexually

3055.66 --> 3062.89
attractive that are really passionate

3058.65 --> 3066.75
that have burning need basically engage

3062.89 --> 3068.92
in that and they're they're like really

3066.75 --> 3072.849
waiting for a good opportunity so

3068.92 --> 3075.4300000000003
there's also that you know and I can

3072.849 --> 3077.2000000000003
imagine and imagine I don't really do

3075.43 --> 3081.0589999999997
anything at the moment that that can be

3077.2 --> 3084.1299999999997
very satisfying because to me to be fair

3081.059 --> 3086.619
in sex there is nothing more satisfying

3084.13 --> 3089.38
than somebody you're doing

3086.619 --> 3094.289
had with who's really into it nothing

3089.38 --> 3094.289
better so yeah

3101.27 --> 3107.06
yeah exactly like Nathan said anything

3103.88 --> 3109.3900000000003
is quite upfront about that that's his

3107.06 --> 3114.37
style but yeah that's true

3109.39 --> 3119.0299999999997
so I don't know it's kind of weird but

3114.37 --> 3122.42
if you really have the need to do that

3119.03 --> 3125.48
are you gonna look for some model let's

3122.42 --> 3127.4900000000002
just look oh I'm so beautiful I'm so so

3125.48 --> 3129.98
doing the poses Alton you think that's

3127.49 --> 3134.14
gonna be satisfying or are you just

3129.98 --> 3137.87
gonna go to a really nice caring

3134.14 --> 3140.9
good-hearted average looking chick that

3137.87 --> 3143.2999999999997
just really want some love you know I

3140.9 --> 3146.06
think that technically will probably end

3143.3 --> 3148.42
up being a lot more satisfying to be

3146.06 --> 3156.56
fair but yeah

3148.42 --> 3161.36
fortunately a person wants what they

3156.56 --> 3166.67
want and if they're lucky they'll end up

3161.36 --> 3175.4300000000003
getting what they really need so oh god

3166.67 --> 3178.55
Nathan yuck no no no I I don't mind in

3175.43 --> 3182.2999999999997
my mind at least I don't mind women that

3178.55 --> 3184.73
are older than me okay but a granny you

3182.3 --> 3187.8500000000004
know thank you

3184.73 --> 3192.16
sorry that's I know even some granny

3187.85 --> 3192.16
still want that no sorry

3200.049 --> 3203.799
it's a breakfast show

3207.18 --> 3211.99
well what I have to lose

3209.619 --> 3216.7200000000003
probably my caught the content of my

3211.99 --> 3216.72
stomach so let's not do that

3218.809 --> 3223.88
now I know there are people out there

3221.059 --> 3226.779
that just love doing that good luck to

3223.88 --> 3229.099
you you know secondly kind of nice for

3226.779 --> 3231.199
that there are people that love that

3229.099 --> 3233.779
because yeah grannies do need love too

3231.199 --> 3239.509
apparently but it's not my thing

3233.779 --> 3242.769
thank you very much what Andy's can be

3239.509 --> 3246.049
around 40 yeah yeah yeah yeah that's not

3242.769 --> 3248.8999999999996
it's not exactly the same and besides if

3246.049 --> 3251.269
you're gonna be a granny at 40 you're

3248.9 --> 3255.65
probably not gonna be screwing around

3251.269 --> 3258.859
like that or you're gonna be absolute

3255.65 --> 3260.929
trash not necessarily that getting kids

3258.859 --> 3263.65
young will make you automatically

3260.929 --> 3263.65
trash but

3269.56 --> 3281.47
that's Joe ever confirmed ageist what

3280.15 --> 3291.13
because I don't wanna have sex with

3281.47 --> 3294.5699999999997
granny what the hell hey look I I really

3291.13 --> 3298.9300000000003
down mine I don't I don't have to be

3294.57 --> 3302.65
super young or like 18 or 20 years even

3298.93 --> 3304.75
in their 20s now you know can be amazing

3302.65 --> 3309.4
absolutely the the young energy is

3304.75 --> 3312.88
awesome but you know it there are some

3309.4 --> 3316.9900000000002
chicks in their forties that need that

3312.88 --> 3319.84
are just like whoo let's not get too

3316.99 --> 3321.75
much into it but yeah I know ages that

3319.84 --> 3327.52

3321.75 --> 3331.2

3327.52 --> 3331.2
good for a morning breakfast show

3332.13 --> 3338.13
so please subscribe to my channel I'll

3335.71 --> 3340.66
be do this thousand subscribers and

3338.13 --> 3344.77
share the show with anyone you think is

3340.66 --> 3350.04
interested or looking for a 39 year old

3344.77 --> 3350.04
elf to try a relation out just kidding

3351.15 --> 3354.15

yeah please do help me get to those

3358.86 --> 3366.6
thousand subscribers and see ya see if

3365.43 --> 3369.45
it is even possible

3366.6 --> 3372.42
it is gogo gonna allow it or do I have

3369.45 --> 3375.87
to make a special video about how Google

3372.42 --> 3383.64
algorithm is conspiring conspiring to

3375.87 --> 3386.0099999999998
prevent me from monetizing because yeah

3383.64 --> 3387.87
I don't know it's not really that hard

3386.01 --> 3391.92
to prove this theory at this point now

3387.87 --> 3394.1099999999997
is it keeping a live subscriber count

3391.92 --> 3402.96
we've seen it go up and down and up and

3394.11 --> 3405.4500000000003
down and it's still 935 who despite

3402.96 --> 3407.9
somebody just subscribing so yeah

3405.45 --> 3407.8999999999996
typical

3430.4 --> 3433.75
I look 18 really

3434.809 --> 3438.9390000000003
Thanks I hope I do

3440.859 --> 3450.569
keep it pg well I technically have sort

3446.95 --> 3450.569
of thing you know

3452.469 --> 3462.2290000000003
besides what these days is considered PG

3456.529 --> 3465.949
is quite insane so I'd like to keep it a

3462.229 --> 3469.689
little bit beyond PG and more like 90s

3465.949 --> 3469.689
era PG that would be a lot better

3489.02 --> 3491.89
I mean this

3491.9 --> 3500.5
it's gold I made this and a granite it's

3496.58 --> 3500.5
the type of crystal and it's actually

3507.77 --> 3510.67
cool isn't it

3511.87 --> 3514.71
I made this

3516.56 --> 3523.66
in 2009 a long time ago I have it for I

3520.76 --> 3523.6600000000003
have it for a while

3528.31 --> 3535.119
no person

3530.65 --> 3537.2200000000003
what well Hilversum is very close to

3535.119 --> 3540.2490000000003
where I live but I've never actually

3537.22 --> 3542.5589999999997
lived there I know there's a lot of TV

3540.249 --> 3546.16
studio things going on over there

3542.559 --> 3548.98
lots of Dutch media people do live in EA

3546.16 --> 3550.5989999999997
over some but is that what you're saying

3548.98 --> 3555.73
do I look like a typical Dutch media

3550.599 --> 3559.7490000000003
person because I almost have to say yeah

3555.73 --> 3561.88
I kind of do because watching some Dutch

3559.749 --> 3564.6699999999996
TV programmes and all the people are

3561.88 --> 3567.7000000000003
wearing this that's so weird

3564.67 --> 3570.69
it's like okay looks familiar

3567.7 --> 3574.6899999999996
these people don't really have long hair

3570.69 --> 3579.819
mostly bald but okay I guess I have that

3574.69 --> 3582.819
look but to be fair I started it because

3579.819 --> 3587.23
I look like this for more than ten years

3582.819 --> 3593.22
pretty much and very monotonous

3587.23 --> 3593.22
in the way I look so I was first

3611.0 --> 3618.62
huh cool okay things of nature yeah well

3615.41 --> 3621.47
I am a goldsmith so the problem right

3618.62 --> 3623.33
now is is that I don't have my equipment

3621.47 --> 3628.1
available to you I don't have a workshop

3623.33 --> 3632.27
and I need to upgrade my living

3628.1 --> 3634.91
situation to be in to be properly able

3632.27 --> 3637.64
to do that kind of stuff again and I

3634.91 --> 3639.68
would love to I have been a professional

3637.64 --> 3641.21
goldsmith I have actually made money

3639.68 --> 3643.8199999999997
from it I've made wedding rings

3641.21 --> 3646.1
there are thousands of euros very well

3643.82 --> 3648.05
worth it that were extremely unique and

3646.1 --> 3650.12
I have photographs of this on my

3648.05 --> 3653.2400000000002
Symbolics Danelle site if you care to

3650.12 --> 3656.21
look so I would love to do that again I

3653.24 --> 3659.27
love doing it I just wasn't very good at

3656.21 --> 3661.31
doing business that was my problem and

3659.27 --> 3664.43
it might probably be a lot better at it

3661.31 --> 3667.5499999999997
if I reengage yet it because I am just

3664.43 --> 3670.18
more social now I know better how to

3667.55 --> 3672.17
contact people I have a community I

3670.18 --> 3675.1099999999997
didn't have that back then I was very

3672.17 --> 3679.09
isolated it was very weird weirded out

3675.11 --> 3682.9900000000002
by the recent experiences that I've only

3679.09 --> 3686.27
partially remembered like a dream and

3682.99 --> 3688.68
yeah the vision stuff

3686.27 --> 3690.45
you know

3688.68 --> 3693.23
my goldsmithing and everything pretty

3690.45 --> 3693.23
much came after that

3694.47 --> 3701.1299999999997
and I would love to do it again but yeah

3697.079 --> 3705.78
I need I need you're worried not really

3701.13 --> 3708.329
but I need a better a better living

3705.78 --> 3710.48
situation and I'm probably not gonna get

3708.329 --> 3713.75
it because there's a waiting row and a

3710.48 --> 3716.7
hundred thousand other people including

3713.75 --> 3718.8
newly integrated migrants that are being

3716.7 --> 3721.47
prioritized over me because I'm a white

3718.8 --> 3723.599
male hooray I can probably wait the rest

3721.47 --> 3726.99
of my life for it and not get that room

3723.599 --> 3730.79
while other people's just maybe you have

3726.99 --> 3735.359
to wait poppier four years I don't know

3730.79 --> 3737.7599999999998
it's maybe I'm exaggerating at this but

3735.359 --> 3739.5299999999997
that's how it feels to me and I've

3737.76 --> 3741.69
talked about it with social workers and

3739.53 --> 3744.599
they kind of say yeah you're kind of

3741.69 --> 3746.4900000000002
right so yeah I am kind of right and

3744.599 --> 3748.02
it's not gonna be the way it's gonna

3746.49 --> 3750.45
happen unfortunately I'm gonna have to

3748.02 --> 3752.43
upgrade my entire financial situation

3750.45 --> 3754.14
which is gonna be pretty drastic because

3752.43 --> 3757.589
that means also climbing out of my

3754.14 --> 3760.859
social welfare until I can get a bigger

3757.589 --> 3762.99
apartment and get all my stuff from

3760.859 --> 3764.49
storage back including my goldsmithing

3762.99 --> 3767.069
so I can work on goldsmithing

3764.49 --> 3769.0499999999997
so I can have a proper awesome

3767.069 --> 3771.39
background for this show where it can

3769.05 --> 3774.9300000000003
show you my entire crystal collection in

3771.39 --> 3778.71
one viewed window okay I can do that I

3774.93 --> 3780.7799999999997
have a lot of crystals that I can use

3778.71 --> 3783.599
and I don't want to be wanting to use

3780.78 --> 3787.26
this since I started doing hangouts and

3783.599 --> 3789.7400000000002
YouTube but yeah doesn't fit here I need

3787.26 --> 3794.55
to be able to walk around and sleep

3789.74 --> 3797.2799999999997
without risking having hundreds of kilos

3794.55 --> 3799.65
of stone piling on me while I'm sleeping

3797.28 --> 3803.8500000000004
or something so doesn't

3799.65 --> 3807.6600000000003
we're here uh so yeah I need a new

3803.85 --> 3810.54
apartment and then if that time comes

3807.66 --> 3814.2
then I will be able to do both smithing

3810.54 --> 3818.33
and all kinds of things love it

3814.2 --> 3818.33
can't wait till the time is there

3820.8 --> 3828.4500000000003
and yeah I wouldn't even be shy to do

3825.39 --> 3831.81
live streams of gold smithing and show

3828.45 --> 3834.5899999999997
you how it's actually done that will be

3831.81 --> 3834.59
interesting wouldn't it

3838.68 --> 3846.54
right yeah fine each Channel and a lot

3843.57 --> 3848.5800000000004
of people know somebody that have a

3846.54 --> 3853.23
goldsmith either and their family or

3848.58 --> 3855.5099999999998
married in yeah because there are just

3853.23 --> 3859.76
especially in the Netherlands there's a

3855.51 --> 3859.76
huge surplus of Goldsmith's and

3862.87 --> 3870.8199999999997
yeah it's kind of rare that you can make

3866.68 --> 3873.49
a living of it and kind of did know that

3870.82 --> 3876.2200000000003
when I engage in this education because

3873.49 --> 3878.5
I just wanted to learn the skills I want

3876.22 --> 3880.72
to be able to make my own jewelry that's

3878.5 --> 3884.83
really the reason why I wanted why I

3880.72 --> 3890.2
wanted that which is not a very good

3884.83 --> 3892.12
reason but I did it and I'm still happy

3890.2 --> 3895.3599999999997
about it despite everything that I know

3892.12 --> 3899.56
this and yeah I know it I can do it so I

3895.36 --> 3902.65
can still do something new as soon as I

3899.56 --> 3905.29
get the opportunity maybe make art

3902.65 --> 3907.6
pieces what I've always been doing with

3905.29 --> 3913.45
my goldsmithing what my focus was is to

3907.6 --> 3915.3399999999997
just design and make from the minds of

3913.45 --> 3920.29
my clients so they have something in

3915.34 --> 3923.26
mind and then I manifested in whatever

3920.29 --> 3925.7799999999997
way possible and I try to make exactly

3923.26 --> 3928.09
what they've been looking for even

3925.78 --> 3929.6800000000003
though they don't exactly know yet what

3928.09 --> 3931.1800000000003
they've been looking for or think they

3929.68 --> 3934.0
know exactly what they've been looking

3931.18 --> 3936.69
for but our mistaken that's another

3934.0 --> 3939.58
process it's a personal one-on-one

3936.69 --> 3941.83
process and I've done that many times

3939.58 --> 3944.5
and it's very funny that people usually

3941.83 --> 3946.42
start out with certain ideas and then

3944.5 --> 3949.6
end up with completely different ideas

3946.42 --> 3951.28
that are much that feel much better to

3949.6 --> 3953.79
them but they just hadn't touched upon

3951.28 --> 3953.7900000000004
it yet

3955.05 --> 3957.8
Christine

3974.96 --> 3979.67
oh yeah and indeed Goldsmith's have a

3977.869 --> 3981.6800000000003
lot of work at churches but yeah guess

3979.67 --> 3982.73
what there's a lot of churches that have

3981.68 --> 3986.6189999999997
a lot of Goldsmith's

3982.73 --> 3990.619
to do that work obviously gonna keep

3986.619 --> 3993.619
within the church or stick to the very

3990.619 --> 3995.69
very very best that are super

3993.619 --> 3997.4300000000003
professionals with super workshops that

3995.69 --> 4005.589
will do it absolutely perfectly that's

3997.43 --> 4012.64
usually how that is done me my I I do my

4005.589 --> 4018.21
own thing I make unique spiritually

4012.64 --> 4018.21
imbued pieces that

4018.29 --> 4024.65
I have their own character that are not

4020.9 --> 4026.63
just a standard thingy that you put in a

4024.65 --> 4029.7200000000003
box in between your and the other jewels

4026.63 --> 4031.4900000000002
that's I want to make special stuff that

4029.72 --> 4034.1
is going to be very special very

4031.49 --> 4040.1899999999996
personal to a person that's what I want

4034.1 --> 4042.89
to do and I have I made to signal the

4040.19 --> 4045.44
Signet rings and of course wedding rings

4042.89 --> 4048.5899999999997
you don't put wedding rings in in the

4045.44 --> 4049.42
drawer of course that's not a very good

4048.59 --> 4056.21
person

4049.42 --> 4059.27
let's just say that but yeah I'm not

4056.21 --> 4061.2200000000003
like oh look I have 100 rings here just

4059.27 --> 4064.79
pick one out and we've got a special

4061.22 --> 4066.7099999999996
price and Rea they get it and it's like

4064.79 --> 4068.66
oh look I got an o-ring and the next day

4066.71 --> 4070.609
they put it back in the drawer and they

4068.66 --> 4073.0899999999997
forgot about it no that's not the kind

4070.609 --> 4073.09
of stuff I mean

4075.05 --> 4083.4100000000003
hold on oh right Karen wants to hear

4080.51 --> 4089.1800000000003
about crystals oh yeah

4083.41 --> 4093.56
crystals their crystalline and they're

4089.18 --> 4098.63
usually minerals and I have a lot of

4093.56 --> 4099.92
them and been collecting them since I

4098.63 --> 4102.62
was six

4099.92 --> 4107.66
it's probably the first money I ever

4102.62 --> 4109.849999999999
gotten I spent on crystals or maybe I

4107.66 --> 4113.12
didn't candy I don't know exactly which

4109.85 --> 4116.120000000001
one it was but crystals and candy it's

4113.12 --> 4119.15
like candy is was to me crystals that I

4116.12 --> 4124.849999999999
could eat and crystals was just to look

4119.15 --> 4130.4
at that's how I saw things yeah

4124.85 --> 4134.150000000001
Karen B look I I don't have my entire

4130.4 --> 4138.29
collection here right I have just a few

4134.15 --> 4142.19
you know and you've already seen my

4138.29 --> 4145.31
quartz crystal collection that I put in

4142.19 --> 4148.759999999999
the backdrop on that scale every four

4145.31 --> 4151.85
episodes of the flattered talks but it's

4148.76 --> 4155.93
a lot of work installing that and I have

4151.85 --> 4158.120000000001
them locked in yeah in a special box

4155.93 --> 4160.549
with foam in between and everything so

4158.12 --> 4163.46
they don't damage not gonna get that out

4160.549 --> 4165.7699999999995
it's like take that that takes me ten

4163.46 --> 4168.109
minutes to to get that out and I'm gonna

4165.77 --> 4169.819
do that during the show I do have some

4168.109 --> 4173.0
other stones I think I showed some of

4169.819 --> 4175.81
them earlier it's not all that's super

4173.0 --> 4175.81
special but

4187.589 --> 4190.37
this one

4191.099 --> 4196.53
funny thing is

4192.96 --> 4199.07
this one lays around all the time what I

4196.53 --> 4201.78
constantly forget that I have it like

4199.07 --> 4204.2699999999995
constantly every time I look at it it's

4201.78 --> 4206.009999999999
like oh wow I have that and then I look

4204.27 --> 4209.34
away and I forget it it's really weird

4206.01 --> 4212.969
but yeah this is the biggest labradorite

4209.34 --> 4219.96
that I have and yeah it's a very special

4212.969 --> 4222.06
rock with yeah reflective things as part

4219.96 --> 4227.07
of it I don't know don't get the right

4222.06 --> 4228.870000000001
angle to show you the colors the light

4227.07 --> 4231.23
may simply not be sufficient here and

4228.87 --> 4231.23
let's see

4236.38 --> 4239.55
but yeah it has

4240.09 --> 4246.17
it's to describe this it's

4243.94 --> 4249.739
this rock has many

4246.17 --> 4252.969
different layers with different colors

4249.739 --> 4256.459999999999
that reflect like a reflector naturally

4252.969 --> 4259.55
it's a very special stone that the stone

4256.46 --> 4261.469
type itself has interesting let's just

4259.55 --> 4266.05
say spiritual properties resonance

4261.469 --> 4268.67
properties because it is a character

4266.05 --> 4274.429
personal character stabilizing influence

4268.67 --> 4278.15
we have this they could even technically

4274.429 --> 4282.11
be considered if you accept this kind of

4278.15 --> 4284.96
thing and antipsychotic because if you

4282.11 --> 4289.369
have this there's much less likelihood

4284.96 --> 4292.19
that you will wander off in behavior

4289.369 --> 4294.65
that's not really fitting to your to

4292.19 --> 4296.869
your natural character yeah never

4294.65 --> 4298.099999999999
experience that I have one aim right

4296.869 --> 4300.58
here in my pocket that I've been

4298.1 --> 4300.58
carrying

4301.589 --> 4305.179
for at least 15 years

4310.989 --> 4320.879999999999
it's a very special rock see what I got

4313.989 --> 4320.879999999999
here oh yeah Mike Cotter Ruby

4321.619 --> 4327.5599999999995
it's a very special stone it's kind of

4324.32 --> 4330.199
price pricey I originally made this for

4327.56 --> 4333.38
a very deluxe ring but then the person

4330.199 --> 4337.46
they basically cancelled the order so

4333.38 --> 4340.13
yeah it was under condition that yeah

4337.46 --> 4342.949
once I make orders for part of that

4340.13 --> 4343.909000000001
thing I'm making you can get your money

4342.949 --> 4347.629999999999
back no matter what

4343.909 --> 4351.65
and yeah I will not charge you for the

4347.63 --> 4354.409000000001
labor costs if you cancel but you're not

4351.65 --> 4356.929
getting the money back for for

4354.409 --> 4359.839999999999
everything I personally had invested in

4356.929 --> 4362.29
materials and the sigh yeah they did

4359.84 --> 4365.139
cancel because of some I don't know why

4362.29 --> 4368.239
ended up pretty annoyingly and

4365.139 --> 4372.409000000001
threatening a [ __ ] but yeah I had a

4368.239 --> 4375.739
thing my mother-in-law I had a lawyer

4372.409 --> 4377.388999999999
available and yeah tell him like yes

4375.739 --> 4380.959999999999
stop bothering him this was in the

4377.389 --> 4384.77
contract so but I did get managed to get

4380.96 --> 4391.719
a really awesome unfortunately though

4384.77 --> 4391.719
artificial cuts Ruby really big one

4392.339 --> 4397.949
so that's pretty awesome I love this

4395.519 --> 4401.76
rock and this was supposedly gonna be on

4397.949 --> 4405.268999999999
a big golden ring I might still make

4401.76 --> 4410.459
that ring someday but I don't have any

4405.269 --> 4413.639
plans yet also I have several smaller

4410.459 --> 4416.669
versions of this one but it's not in

4413.639 --> 4417.719
this plastic bag for some reason I don't

4416.669 --> 4420.719
know where they are they must be

4417.719 --> 4422.999
somewhere else maybe in my storage I

4420.719 --> 4426.809
don't know maybe oh wait Heather right

4422.999 --> 4431.219
over here all right so here are Smith

4426.809 --> 4432.689
three smaller ones in contrast to the

4431.219 --> 4437.4890000000005
bigger ones you can see the bigger one

4432.689 --> 4440.76
is a lot bigger yeah but as a goldsmith

4437.489 --> 4444.3589999999995
I do know where to get cut gems and

4440.76 --> 4447.179
there's places where you can just pick

4444.359 --> 4449.479
out so many different types so

4447.179 --> 4451.9490000000005
incredibly many different types from

4449.479 --> 4453.539000000001
diamonds to fake diamonds

4451.949 --> 4455.188999999999
I forget the name what it is it's a

4453.539 --> 4457.409
different type of crystal it's very much

4455.189 --> 4461.069
alike and a lot cheaper and yeah just

4457.409 --> 4463.409
has beautiful nice reflective abilities

4461.069 --> 4465.599
very similar to diamonds not exactly the

4463.409 --> 4471.478999999999
same but similar and yeah there's like

4465.599 --> 4476.01
natural rubies artificial rubies current

4471.479 --> 4478.859
type which is a very hard type of stone

4476.01 --> 4481.409000000001
oh my god it's been such a while since I

4478.859 --> 4483.839
even went through all the names of the

4481.409 --> 4486.989
types of stones let's go in goldsmithing

4483.839 --> 4489.269
there are so many types but it's just

4486.989 --> 4492.089
giant collections of different cut gems

4489.269 --> 4495.3
that you can get for any type of jewel

4492.089 --> 4499.109
and you have literally infinite options

4495.3 --> 4503.03
in what you can do concerning what type

4499.109 --> 4503.030000000001
of stones you want to use in some jewel

4503.409 --> 4506.159
see

4508.949 --> 4519.759999999999
yeah I got it here is a a quartz crystal

4515.619 --> 4522.73
that I personally extracted it was not

4519.76 --> 4524.610000000001
the fashion that I bought it in and why

4522.73 --> 4530.049999999999
did I extract this from a bigger piece

4524.61 --> 4533.11
because it is the clearest little piece

4530.05 --> 4535.4800000000005
is most clearest perfect little piece of

4533.11 --> 4538.42
quartz crystal I've ever seen

4535.48 --> 4544.2699999999995
I can look really close with my eyes and

4538.42 --> 4547.96
just see absolutely no flaw to it

4544.27 --> 4551.67
whatsoever it's absolutely beautiful and

4547.96 --> 4555.25
I extracted this part from a bigger a

4551.67 --> 4556.9
bigger chunk with pieces of crystal all

4555.25 --> 4560.17
over the place and here are some of the

4556.9 --> 4562.5599999999995
remains because I completely dismantle

4560.17 --> 4562.56
it ooh

4563.28 --> 4570.869
here are some other parts there they all

4565.659 --> 4570.869
not so pure so gassy

4572.159 --> 4578.42
wait no this is not the right one from

4576.06 --> 4578.42
the same

4583.26 --> 4592.33
not so much saying it's it yeah this was

4588.31 --> 4596.29
it it came from this thing so you can

4592.33 --> 4599.35
still see it's kind of yeah typical

4596.29 --> 4602.44
thing and this little thing came out of

4599.35 --> 4604.660000000001
that and this is yeah it's nice you know

4602.44 --> 4610.5
it's really nice but this is perfectly

4604.66 --> 4610.5
clear and I love that special

4617.23 --> 4623.549999999999
yeah I make this a long time ago a lot

4619.87 --> 4629.89
about it this is aquamarin

4623.55 --> 4631.63
set in silver and you can see as long as

4629.89 --> 4634.81
looks like horse but you can see it's

4631.63 --> 4640.06
aquamarin when you look at it and then

4634.81 --> 4643.900000000001
certainly the lack of crystal clarity

4640.06 --> 4647.1
the obstruction from the inner crystal

4643.9 --> 4651.339999999999
shows you it is actually turquoise or

4647.1 --> 4654.27
greenish colored which is exactly what

4651.34 --> 4654.27
aquamarine is

4654.69 --> 4664.11
let me see it and again I like

4660.949 --> 4667.23
compatible thingies oh yeah I made this

4664.11 --> 4671.009999999999
socket for it you can just flip it in

4667.23 --> 4673.379999999999
and it'll stay there exactly like it is

4671.01 --> 4675.3
there's only one way to fit it and then

4673.38 --> 4678.36
basically you have to really push it in

4675.3 --> 4680.929
because it is so tight that it's like a

4678.36 --> 4680.929
vacuum

4683.069 --> 4687.620000000001
Yeah right this is the

4685.85 --> 4691.490000000001
it's never going to drop out of there by

4687.62 --> 4694.82
itself you really have to pull it to do

4691.49 --> 4697.12
that so that's kind of thing that I love

4694.82 --> 4697.12
to do

4699.23 --> 4701.83
let's see

4702.369 --> 4711.889
hmm oh oh here's another really good

4708.28 --> 4715.989
quartz piece it's also very clear I

4711.889 --> 4715.9890000000005
think I extracted it from the same chunk

4729.349 --> 4732.349
scheisse

4737.34 --> 4740.24
I'm still bright

4744.48 --> 4749.9
oh nice look how that zoomed in

4753.56 --> 4760.81
that is awesome thank you camera for

4755.9 --> 4760.8099999999995
auto zooming rack what you needed to

4764.2 --> 4767.2
yeah

4771.8 --> 4778.04
more labradorites I think I have like

4774.71 --> 4782.9
hundreds of them but I also do give them

4778.04 --> 4785.2
away it's more lever to rights smaller

4782.9 --> 4785.2
ones

4787.02 --> 4791.72
elected there so much crazy

4805.0 --> 4814.32
more labradorites yeah oh wow these are

4810.37 --> 4814.32
amazing that

4820.269 --> 4823.4400000000005
both sides of thing

4826.53 --> 4832.82
and this one is a lighter color and

4828.869 --> 4832.82
that's even more special

4843.78 --> 4848.429999999999
and it's not coming across on camera as

4846.36 --> 4850.83
well as it does when you actually look

4848.43 --> 4853.97
on it with your own eyes and that's also

4850.83 --> 4856.38
because the reflector parts within it

4853.97 --> 4859.2
when you actually look at it in 3d

4856.38 --> 4861.74
there's just more angles then you

4859.2 --> 4865.59
actually see to it then this one still

4861.74 --> 4868.05
image it's different the only way to

4865.59 --> 4879.12
really appreciate the beauty is to look

4868.05 --> 4884.04
at it with your own eyes always this is

4879.12 --> 4886.37
the chunk I got it from the smaller

4884.04 --> 4890.15
parts you can see that the sizes of this

4886.37 --> 4890.15
also matches

4892.91 --> 4904.83
we know they're not gonna rob me tonight

4900.44 --> 4907.259999999999
cuz if they try that screw themselves

4904.83 --> 4910.8
and besides all of this is really not

4907.26 --> 4912.93
that valuable okay and really isn't it's

4910.8 --> 4914.610000000001
just really beautiful you think I'm

4912.93 --> 4917.0
gonna just I'm not one of these guys

4914.61 --> 4921.0199999999995
like oh I have to get the most expensive

4917.0 --> 4924.27
no I don't have any real diamonds I

4921.02 --> 4926.22
don't have any extremely rare super

4924.27 --> 4929.43
precious stones I just have really

4926.22 --> 4932.58
special stones that have really special

4929.43 --> 4936.33
energetic properties that's what I've

4932.58 --> 4941.43
been focusing I'm not just hoarding

4936.33 --> 4943.88
wealth so I wish them a lot of luck this

4941.43 --> 4943.88
one's nice

4951.92 --> 4953.95
II

4955.39 --> 4959.64
don't know what it is I thinks it's

4957.07 --> 4959.639999999999
citrine

4962.64 --> 4974.05
right so anyway that was my stone

4969.46 --> 4977.47
collection and yeah you're really dumb

4974.05 --> 4982.05
enough do you think this is worth loving

4977.47 --> 4982.05
yeah you're a complete idiot

4982.08 --> 4991.09
because I am Here I am defendant this is

4986.77 --> 4994.320000000001
not an easily accessible location and I

4991.09 --> 4997.33
am quite merciless when it comes to

4994.32 --> 4998.86
somebody gonna try to rob me so I wish

4997.33 --> 5001.62
you the best of luck I hope it will be

4998.86 --> 5004.92
worth it I think if you try to still

5001.62 --> 5006.63
sell all the ship all these crystals

5004.92 --> 5008.7
here on the black market or whatever

5006.63 --> 5012.54
you're probably not gonna get 20 bucks

5008.7 --> 5013.4
right so yeah I hope your life is worth

5012.54 --> 5016.73
the risk

5013.4 --> 5016.73
good luck with that

5026.61 --> 5030.74
that Loretta please stop saying that

5029.46 --> 5035.41
it's very annoying

5030.74 --> 5035.41

5048.2 --> 5057.66
