91.28 --> 94.88
so the weather today

96.32 --> 100.67999999999999
is

97.68 --> 100.68
interesting

100.96 --> 105.03999999999999
it's very different

102.64 --> 108.24
seems a lot less moist

105.04 --> 110.32000000000001
it's a lot of wind going on

108.24 --> 112.56
it isn't as hot

110.32 --> 116.15899999999999
so the wind can even be a little chilly

112.56 --> 119.36
here and there but yeah in between that

116.159 --> 124.159
yeah clouds but also very

119.36 --> 126.96
very clear blue swaths of sky

124.159 --> 129.44
with the nice sun coming through then

126.96 --> 131.759
so it's just a really beautiful day

129.44 --> 131.759
really

135.2 --> 139.23899999999998
isn't that just pizza risk

142.879 --> 145.12

150.16 --> 156.959
hello jindaly first in chat good to see

162.319 --> 165.35999999999999
and believe we're almost

165.599 --> 171.2
entering september

168.56 --> 174.31900000000002
in this particular month has gone by

171.2 --> 176.48
like incredibly quickly

174.319 --> 179.599
it's not surprising it is end of summer

176.48 --> 181.67999999999998
and that typically happens

179.599 --> 184.56
you know

181.68 --> 186.48000000000002
yeah it's the summer rhythm

184.56 --> 188.08
uh

186.48 --> 190.879
hello

188.08 --> 193.36
pgcnet good to see you

190.879 --> 195.67999999999998
yeah special shout out to chaoyun cat

193.36 --> 198.0
who came visiting yesterday because

195.68 --> 200.31900000000002
he or she not sure i was thought it was

198.0 --> 202.72
just she

200.319 --> 204.159
sent me some paypals really nice i

202.72 --> 206.64
really never

204.159 --> 208.879
did not expect that i really appreciate

206.64 --> 208.879
that

209.28 --> 213.84
and yeah that that is the thing that

211.28 --> 213.84
keeps me going

225.36 --> 229.44000000000003
yeah pgcnet

227.04 --> 229.44
i know

235.04 --> 238.879
yeah i had a lot of that then again i

237.2 --> 242.959
was

238.879 --> 244.72
relatively easy occupied so for me

242.959 --> 246.64000000000001
it was legos

244.72 --> 249.519
that's where it really started

246.64 --> 252.55999999999997
drawing too but nothing like legos like

249.519 --> 254.87900000000002
space legos especially i would just get

252.56 --> 257.28000000000003
stuck doing that for like hours and

254.879 --> 259.03999999999996
hours and hours and then

257.28 --> 262.15999999999997
started to feel sick because i just

259.04 --> 263.36
didn't even have a drink or anything

262.16 --> 265.36
this is

263.36 --> 267.04
that was before like that sort of thing

265.36 --> 268.40000000000003
happened with the computer but that is

267.04 --> 270.72
always like really

268.4 --> 270.71999999999997
made

272.08 --> 276.71999999999997
my youth a lot more

274.0 --> 279.88
doable hey nathan oakley 1980 good to

276.72 --> 279.88000000000005
see you

282.0 --> 287.919
right because

283.36 --> 287.91900000000004
i was very easily bored overall

288.639 --> 293.68
that's how i then basically got stuck in

291.36 --> 295.199
imagination land pretty much all the

293.68 --> 297.28000000000003
time

295.199 --> 298.8
and that that hung around for a long

297.28 --> 301.19899999999996
time too

298.8 --> 302.88
eventually i realized that

301.199 --> 305.52000000000004
you're not supposed to

302.88 --> 307.759
be like that all the time because

305.52 --> 310.71999999999997
then your fellow

307.759 --> 313.52000000000004
kids of your age category will start to

310.72 --> 315.68
like nag you and just make make fun of

313.52 --> 315.68
you

316.8 --> 320.479
that was like a pretty hard lesson

318.4 --> 322.56
that's really what

320.479 --> 325.84
caused like the whole bullying and all

322.56 --> 327.759
that it's just my i was just so

325.84 --> 329.52
i was just a dreamer and i thought that

327.759 --> 332.16
was normal

329.52 --> 332.15999999999997
well it wasn't

332.72 --> 336.88000000000005
i got shamed a lot by a bunch of people

334.72 --> 339.52000000000004
that apparently did not appreciate what

336.88 --> 342.88
i do

339.52 --> 345.28
because even as a kid i was very intense

342.88 --> 347.199
i mean less intense than i am now here

345.28 --> 352.039
online

347.199 --> 352.039
but that intensity was there

354.88 --> 360.8
i just didn't express it as much but it

357.039 --> 365.8
was always dream dream walking i guess

360.8 --> 365.8
hey letter sage good to see you

368.72 --> 372.40000000000003
right

370.0 --> 374.639
but boredom for me as a kid was like

372.4 --> 376.79999999999995
suffering at times it really was it's

374.639 --> 379.28000000000003
like if i didn't have like a computer or

376.8 --> 382.08
my legos i would just become

379.28 --> 385.59999999999997
almost like mopey and even

382.08 --> 385.59999999999997
like seriously sad

386.4 --> 390.31899999999996
because

388.16 --> 393.36
it was kind of rare to even like have

390.319 --> 395.52000000000004
other kids that i could really be amused

393.36 --> 397.36
with because it was always just playing

395.52 --> 398.71999999999997
with language playing with things

397.36 --> 400.16
playing with everything and if they

398.72 --> 402.40000000000003
can't keep up

400.16 --> 404.72
internally then they just like don't

402.4 --> 408.31899999999996
like me

404.72 --> 410.72
and then i feel really isolated

408.319 --> 413.599
and that's not good

410.72 --> 415.91900000000004
and legos really was the answer as a kid

413.599 --> 415.919
for me

417.52 --> 421.52
it's also how they sort of thought that

419.28 --> 424.479
like i'm hyperactive because they always

421.52 --> 427.599
just had to keep me busy or i would

424.479 --> 429.599
almost like break out in tears

427.599 --> 431.599
well i wouldn't do that too quickly but

429.599 --> 434.24
the mood would be there and that would

431.599 --> 436.319
influence everybody

434.24 --> 439.36
it's like yeah if you don't keep arwen

436.319 --> 441.599
busy and and happy enough then like the

439.36 --> 442.72
entire mood of everybody will just

441.599 --> 446.88
completely

442.72 --> 446.88000000000005
get spoiled somehow i just do that

448.4 --> 451.4
anyway

451.52 --> 455.28
at least you didn't end up like bob

460.96 --> 467.12
oh yeah yeah yeah the video

463.36 --> 467.12
the the video i sent you it was g

469.84 --> 474.479
i thought that was like really hilarious

472.24 --> 476.639
i rarely even go to that site but in

474.479 --> 478.479
this case i just like i thought oh just

476.639 --> 482.479
click it let's see what i find and this

478.479 --> 484.4
was there and i was like bob really

482.479 --> 486.479
really that's so

484.4 --> 488.56
funny in a silly

486.479 --> 489.44
slightly synchronistic way it's just

488.56 --> 493.0
yeah

489.44 --> 493.0
it was just funny

497.28 --> 502.08
yeah and at least you and me are now

499.039 --> 505.039
having a bit of an internal

502.08 --> 508.8
joke here over a video

505.039 --> 508.8
that i shared with him over skype

514.56 --> 519.5189999999999
i'd love to link you guys up but it's

516.399 --> 521.279
also really gross he is a serious potty

519.519 --> 523.519
mouth

521.279 --> 523.519
so

526.48 --> 530.9590000000001
all right there's this guy who's like a

529.36 --> 533.839
sort of game reviewer who uses

530.959 --> 538.64
animations it's been doing this for

533.839 --> 538.6400000000001
over a decade i think very long

539.36 --> 543.92
so many reviews it's unbelievable what's

541.839 --> 546.72
called zero punctuation because he does

543.92 --> 550.64
it really fast so every clip

546.72 --> 553.44
is like one half minute max

550.64 --> 556.48
and he says everything you could say

553.44 --> 558.1600000000001
including like super quick humor

556.48 --> 560.9590000000001
all in that one half minute about the

558.16 --> 565.1999999999999
entire game that he's probably spent

560.959 --> 567.68
playing for like 10 hours or something

565.2 --> 570.9590000000001
it is sometimes funny sometimes it's

567.68 --> 572.399
just like god i wish i i'm glad i'm not

570.959 --> 575.04
that guy

572.399 --> 578.0
because his mind is just so screwed up

575.04 --> 581.8389999999999
because of all that [ __ ]

578.0 --> 584.8
he plays all the [ __ ] up games you see

581.839 --> 587.7600000000001
like the really bad propaganda [ __ ] and

584.8 --> 588.88
just where it's totally insane or evil

587.76 --> 592.0
or

588.88 --> 594.399
it just checks everything out

592.0 --> 594.399
anyway

596.959 --> 600.88
yeah yeah now yeah that's what you're

599.04 --> 603.519
talking yeah you're talking about the

600.88 --> 606.959
the guy bob who was like

603.519 --> 608.9590000000001
bob's game it's apparently a game

606.959 --> 611.279
by a guy named bob who made it and he

608.959 --> 614.079
was like no i'm gonna make it this way

611.279 --> 615.8389999999999
he was like really autistic about it

614.079 --> 617.1999999999999
and it kind of flopped and then he made

615.839 --> 618.9590000000001
a demo

617.2 --> 620.6400000000001
and the demo was actually really cool

618.959 --> 622.56
but like every time he just kept

620.64 --> 626.079
screwing it up

622.56 --> 628.88
okay so if you really want to see it

626.079 --> 630.28
yeah definitely not for kids

628.88 --> 633.45
check it out

630.28 --> 633.4499999999999
[Music]

634.8 --> 639.04
if i could travel back in time what

636.959 --> 642.399
advice would you provide to your teenage

639.04 --> 642.399
self i already did that

643.36 --> 646.6800000000001
it uh

647.68 --> 650.959
it's overestimated

654.959 --> 660.56
but yeah i have literal vision memories

657.92 --> 663.36
of my older self

660.56 --> 663.3599999999999
approaching me

663.839 --> 668.48
and i was very unhappy about it

667.04 --> 670.959
i mean

668.48 --> 672.72
as my older self actually doing that was

670.959 --> 674.64
quite exhilarating even though i felt

672.72 --> 676.24
incredibly guilty about a whole bunch of

674.64 --> 679.6
things at the time

676.24 --> 682.0
not directly related to my younger self

679.6 --> 684.8000000000001
but my younger self was just really

682.0 --> 687.519
scared and

684.8 --> 690.079
it to me it felt like am i gonna become

687.519 --> 691.839
like a darth vader or something i don't

690.079 --> 695.279
want that

691.839 --> 695.2790000000001
it's what it kind of felt like

696.88 --> 702.2
i was

698.32 --> 702.2
not happily impressed

702.8 --> 708.0
okay i bet you didn't expect that answer

704.88 --> 708.0
did you see me traveler

708.16 --> 711.16
ah

721.36 --> 723.6800000000001
what

726.16 --> 731.279
right but the

727.76 --> 732.88
ah okay

731.279 --> 736.88
weird

732.88 --> 739.04
but yeah what did i say to myself

736.88 --> 742.24
well as soon as you actually have an

739.04 --> 745.04
ability to do something like that

742.24 --> 745.92
and i don't recommend trying to attain

745.04 --> 749.04
it

745.92 --> 750.56
because it's not worth it in the end

749.04 --> 753.1999999999999
you just get

750.56 --> 755.5999999999999
you you basically get completely swamped

753.2 --> 759.839
in the cassandra complex

755.6 --> 759.839
you cannot avoid it it is a

760.0 --> 762.72
like a guardian not or what do you call

762.079 --> 763.68
it

762.72 --> 766.24
it's just

763.68 --> 768.4799999999999
it never works

766.24 --> 770.48
the only thing i effectively got out of

768.48 --> 773.839
it is an interesting storyboard to

770.48 --> 773.839
reflect upon

774.32 --> 779.9200000000001
i don't know what life would have been

776.8 --> 782.7199999999999
like if i hadn't had that

779.92 --> 786.88
and i could safely say

782.72 --> 789.839
that probably i had a better life

786.88 --> 792.32
it's like a curse and i just managed to

789.839 --> 794.5600000000001
figure a way out to exploit it not to be

792.32 --> 797.6
just miserable for the rest of my life

794.56 --> 797.5999999999999
over my mistake

798.0 --> 801.399
but anyway

803.04 --> 808.639
yeah what did i say well i realized

805.279 --> 810.88
immediately i can't really inform myself

808.639 --> 812.9590000000001
about what's happening

810.88 --> 815.2
not

812.959 --> 817.68
that i just

815.2 --> 819.839
don't want to do it's like you can't do

817.68 --> 822.399
that

819.839 --> 824.639
you cannot do that

822.399 --> 827.04
literally it's impossible to do that you

824.639 --> 829.6
can't warn yourself for specific things

827.04 --> 833.04
in order to prevent them

829.6 --> 836.16
so what can you do

833.04 --> 837.5999999999999
well you can try to

836.16 --> 840.8389999999999
awaken

837.6 --> 844.32
or reinforce a

840.839 --> 847.6800000000001
vision and what did i do

844.32 --> 850.0
i said don't be afraid you're gonna be

847.68 --> 851.12
like one of the mightiest wizards of

850.0 --> 852.8
this age

851.12 --> 856.079
yet

852.8 --> 858.7199999999999
and i meant it

856.079 --> 860.3199999999999
like you will know darkness and it will

858.72 --> 861.6800000000001
scar you

860.32 --> 863.44
but

861.68 --> 865.68
there's nothing you can really do to

863.44 --> 867.44
stop it i tried

865.68 --> 869.5999999999999
it's not preventable like you couldn't

867.44 --> 872.0
even virtually figure out how to prevent

869.6 --> 874.0790000000001
that from happening because of the

872.0 --> 877.36
choice of attaining the power and not

874.079 --> 877.3599999999999
let it be stripped from me

878.88 --> 884.399
and so you basically i gave a warning

881.36 --> 885.76
like okay take things serious like brace

884.399 --> 889.839
yourself

885.76 --> 889.8389999999999
which was making me miserable

892.959 --> 897.279
but yeah

894.32 --> 899.44
oh i love myself so much as a youngster

897.279 --> 901.199
i'm just going to let him be

899.44 --> 902.0790000000001
knowing everything that's going to

901.199 --> 904.88
happen

902.079 --> 907.4399999999999
but not being able to communicate it no

904.88 --> 909.6
i basically chose to tell myself brace

907.44 --> 912.0
yourself things are going to get really

909.6 --> 915.12
serious don't downplay yourself you're

912.0 --> 917.44
really [ __ ] smart it is surreal

915.12 --> 920.0
it will be a long time before you even

917.44 --> 922.32
find any people that can recognize the

920.0 --> 924.8
level that you can attain let alone

922.32 --> 924.8000000000001
match it

925.44 --> 929.44
yeah that sounds quite

927.76 --> 932.399
bombastic doesn't it

929.44 --> 932.399
but that's what i did

932.8 --> 937.24
what age was your younger self

941.279 --> 945.04
it's tough to tell exactly

947.519 --> 951.839
it

948.639 --> 956.639
i think i was 21

951.839 --> 956.639
my older self and my younger self was

958.8 --> 963.279
t yeah either

961.04 --> 966.24
10 11 or 12

963.279 --> 967.04
but it's you see

966.24 --> 969.759
it

967.04 --> 972.399
was also a dark world dream in which

969.759 --> 972.399
that happened

972.56 --> 977.279
so it wasn't literally like i saw myself

974.959 --> 979.5999999999999
from the future in waking life it was in

977.279 --> 982.959
a dark world dream which i did have

979.6 --> 987.1990000000001
regularly some of which included the

982.959 --> 987.199
extremely [ __ ] up parts

988.8 --> 990.959
like

991.92 --> 996.24
also

993.68 --> 999.279
like gaping nightmares that suddenly are

996.24 --> 1001.759
unleashed and you can't flee

999.279 --> 1004.959
well there well yeah if you'd have to

1001.759 --> 1006.9590000000001
compare it it is almost like

1004.959 --> 1009.3599999999999
like say in stranger things where it's

1006.959 --> 1012.079
just like ah it overcomes you and

1009.36 --> 1014.5600000000001
suddenly you're somewhere else

1012.079 --> 1017.279
you're in the other dimension

1014.56 --> 1019.7589999999999
it was like that a lot of the times and

1017.279 --> 1021.8389999999999
always when it was in the physical world

1019.759 --> 1023.519
the real tension and was like really

1021.839 --> 1025.76
anxious about something in the real

1023.519 --> 1028.48
world and then suddenly it started

1025.76 --> 1030.0
connecting up with the dark world

1028.48 --> 1032.559
because when i was chill that would

1030.0 --> 1032.559
never happen

1034.64 --> 1039.5200000000002
lucid dreams you know it's not a lucid

1036.72 --> 1041.839
dream

1039.52 --> 1042.6399999999999
or maybe it is that's what i thought it

1041.839 --> 1045.4389999999999
was

1042.64 --> 1049.8400000000001
the thing is it's like one giant

1045.439 --> 1053.799
continuum it's not just separated dreams

1049.84 --> 1053.799
it was a giant continuum

1054.559 --> 1060.16
like a parallel dimension

1057.919 --> 1063.2
and i've had lucid dreams that were

1060.16 --> 1063.2
completely separate

1063.28 --> 1068.16
i've had lucid dreams where i could

1065.44 --> 1071.16
literally have my eyes open see

1068.16 --> 1074.0800000000002
everything in the physical world and

1071.16 --> 1075.8400000000001
simultaneously like a second screen see

1074.08 --> 1079.28
the lucid dream

1075.84 --> 1082.24
and then zoom into one or zone into one

1079.28 --> 1084.0
blank out the other or the reverse like

1082.24 --> 1087.28
you would open one eye and close the

1084.0 --> 1089.039
other like that i had like serious lucid

1087.28 --> 1092.3999999999999
dreaming experience especially when i

1089.039 --> 1096.16
was younger but that wasn't this

1092.4 --> 1098.799
this is not you were not able to access

1096.16 --> 1104.3600000000001
the normal world anymore

1098.799 --> 1104.36
you're caught in the in the dark world

1109.919 --> 1115.3600000000001
more out of body travel perhaps

1113.84 --> 1117.76
but it's more like

1115.36 --> 1120.799
inward travel because it wasn't like oh

1117.76 --> 1123.679
what the hell i am here

1120.799 --> 1124.96
my body is over there no not like that

1123.679 --> 1126.96
not

1124.96 --> 1129.3600000000001
it was just

1126.96 --> 1132.0
click you're in the other dimension but

1129.36 --> 1135.12
i'm very sure it was internally

1132.0 --> 1138.24
so i'd theorize it was through my pineal

1135.12 --> 1141.28
gland getting activated

1138.24 --> 1141.28
and i connected up

1145.84 --> 1149.36
do you have clear memories of both the

1147.679 --> 1151.039
younger and older shelf

1149.36 --> 1156.0
of yes

1151.039 --> 1156.0
yes i actually experienced doing it

1156.72 --> 1161.679
it was

1157.84 --> 1161.6789999999999
something i had to do

1163.76 --> 1169.039
in the dark world it's just like i

1165.679 --> 1171.1200000000001
arrived at a certain point like i am

1169.039 --> 1173.2
something real something serious

1171.12 --> 1174.9599999999998
happening

1173.2 --> 1175.76
like i am

1174.96 --> 1176.88
well

1175.76 --> 1179.76
gonna be

1176.88 --> 1182.0800000000002
traveling in that one moment in my life

1179.76 --> 1183.76
like throughout time

1182.08 --> 1186.0
and that's like very serious

1183.76 --> 1187.76
responsibility

1186.0 --> 1190.4
and one of the things that i did was

1187.76 --> 1192.559
basically go

1190.4 --> 1194.5590000000002
to my younger self

1192.559 --> 1198.08
to show it

1194.559 --> 1198.08
to show that that was gonna happen

1200.24 --> 1204.4
and it's really weird because

1202.24 --> 1206.799
from the older perspective

1204.4 --> 1208.88
saying that to myself i noticed how i

1206.799 --> 1211.679
basically cried out and said i don't

1208.88 --> 1211.679
want to do that

1213.28 --> 1221.84
and really being conflicted by that

1217.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
but also realizing it's already happened

1223.2 --> 1230.159
and even remembering

1226.88 --> 1231.0390000000002
that happening before again when i did

1230.159 --> 1234.7990000000002
it

1231.039 --> 1238.24
did not help the cassandra effect just

1234.799 --> 1238.24
it was always meant to happen

1244.72 --> 1247.919
hi richie

1246.24 --> 1250.799
yeah you saw you have had those

1247.919 --> 1250.7990000000002
experiences too

1251.6 --> 1257.1999999999998
right well these days it happens sorta

1254.4 --> 1258.159
too i can't just like wake up in like

1257.2 --> 1260.48
whoa

1258.159 --> 1264.72
in a realization and then still see the

1260.48 --> 1264.72
dream simultaneously as i am

1265.84 --> 1271.36
also seeing through my eyes

1268.96 --> 1273.52
my eyes sort of have second priority so

1271.36 --> 1277.12
it's like i'm staring into the distance

1273.52 --> 1280.24
kind of my eyes so it is like

1277.12 --> 1282.0
waking up but still daydreaming except

1280.24 --> 1284.72
it was a night dream and it then

1282.0 --> 1286.96
transitions into a daydream

1284.72 --> 1288.72
and then it's yeah

1286.96 --> 1290.72
up to me whether i'm really curious

1288.72 --> 1292.88
about the cohesion of that dream in

1290.72 --> 1294.88
order to keep zoned in and figure out

1292.88 --> 1297.6000000000001
what's going on in order to then

1294.88 --> 1300.159
translate that into waking

1297.6 --> 1303.1589999999999
life translation or that i just let it

1300.159 --> 1303.159
go

1304.64 --> 1308.88
but that happens a lot

1306.48 --> 1308.88
with me

1310.08 --> 1313.9189999999999
although yeah when i really have intense

1312.32 --> 1315.84
dream i don't really have a lot of

1313.919 --> 1319.8400000000001
intense dreams i have dreams but they're

1315.84 --> 1319.84
not super intense a lot

1322.96 --> 1327.919
unless it's like

1324.32 --> 1327.9189999999999
female related or something

1329.76 --> 1332.76
anyway

1348.08 --> 1351.08
right

1361.52 --> 1366.4
see you never know what's gonna happen

1363.76 --> 1369.52
when you think you're asking it a basic

1366.4 --> 1369.52
question to arwen

1371.12 --> 1376.08
you never know for sure what's gonna

1372.88 --> 1377.679
happen might just get a giant roll out

1376.08 --> 1379.76
of something you completely did not

1377.679 --> 1384.039
expect

1379.76 --> 1384.039
hey getting wisdom good to see you

1390.559 --> 1394.32
yeah pgc net you're right

1392.64 --> 1396.96
most people just forget their dreams

1394.32 --> 1396.96
very quickly

1399.84 --> 1404.799
the funny thing with me is is that i've

1402.559 --> 1407.36
noticed distinct difference in what you

1404.799 --> 1409.44
can actually remember for

1407.36 --> 1411.9189999999999
you see if you're going to try to

1409.44 --> 1415.1200000000001
remember for example well what would

1411.919 --> 1418.48
have had to be simulated visuals or

1415.12 --> 1420.3999999999999
sounds those can be extremely tricky to

1418.48 --> 1422.159
figure out how to derive that and then

1420.4 --> 1423.76
translate that

1422.159 --> 1425.6000000000001
to physical

1423.76 --> 1428.08
things

1425.6 --> 1429.6
pictures or music

1428.08 --> 1430.559
something like that

1429.6 --> 1432.3999999999999
but

1430.559 --> 1435.12
one thing i've all noticed that i can

1432.4 --> 1436.4
really easily remember from every dream

1435.12 --> 1437.6
i've had

1436.4 --> 1440.64
and like

1437.6 --> 1442.1589999999999
for the entire day and that is

1440.64 --> 1445.5200000000002
the mood

1442.159 --> 1447.2
the mood of the dream and like

1445.52 --> 1450.799
what it is

1447.2 --> 1453.679
i was doing energy-wise like

1450.799 --> 1456.08
what type of pattern of doing something

1453.679 --> 1459.52
you could compare it with

1456.08 --> 1462.0
that energy level those things i always

1459.52 --> 1462.0
remember

1462.08 --> 1466.799
don't remember what it literally is i

1464.32 --> 1469.52
just know

1466.799 --> 1471.6
like i don't know a crystallized movie

1469.52 --> 1474.679
like that it's not a full picture but i

1471.6 --> 1478.8799999999999
just know kind of what i what it

1474.679 --> 1478.88
represented what i was doing

1479.84 --> 1485.24
and that thing i can pretty much

1481.36 --> 1485.24
remember every time

1491.44 --> 1496.72
okay steven traveler

1493.76 --> 1498.8799999999999
yeah i guess

1496.72 --> 1501.84
still personally i really appreciate

1498.88 --> 1501.8400000000001
nathan's show

1537.84 --> 1542.559
that interest is good

1539.76 --> 1545.2
i'm glad the rachie that you have a

1542.559 --> 1547.36
habit of like self-analyzing analyzing

1545.2 --> 1549.1200000000001
your own perceptions and all that

1547.36 --> 1550.08
because that's a really healthy habit to

1549.12 --> 1551.76
have

1550.08 --> 1554.48
very difficult for a lot of people

1551.76 --> 1556.1589999999999
because because it's such

1554.48 --> 1558.4
it's uh yeah it's almost like well

1556.159 --> 1561.1200000000001
spiritual metadata

1558.4 --> 1564.3200000000002
it is just like the mechanism of your

1561.12 --> 1564.32
exact function but

1564.4 --> 1567.6000000000001
you're doing it

1566.64 --> 1570.0
so

1567.6 --> 1572.3999999999999
for most people they just do it and then

1570.0 --> 1574.159
their consciousness is on a break

1572.4 --> 1576.0800000000002
they're just doing it and they don't

1574.159 --> 1578.5590000000002
really analyze anything

1576.08 --> 1580.6399999999999
well the only way to then actually

1578.559 --> 1582.96
figure out exactly what it is you're

1580.64 --> 1584.88
doing and how you're doing it is to

1582.96 --> 1587.2
actually get your in consciousness

1584.88 --> 1590.5590000000002
involved again as you're doing it so you

1587.2 --> 1593.2
have to be an actor and a spectator of

1590.559 --> 1596.1589999999999
your acting at the same time

1593.2 --> 1599.52
and some people are naturals at that

1596.159 --> 1602.48
others are extremely

1599.52 --> 1605.039
they just have so much difficulty

1602.48 --> 1606.64
switching they just can't do that

1605.039 --> 1608.64
and i think that reiki is probably a

1606.64 --> 1611.2
pretty good switcher

1608.64 --> 1612.72
when it comes to that sort of thing

1611.2 --> 1614.96
people that are good at switching or

1612.72 --> 1617.84
also tend to be

1614.96 --> 1620.799
better at math things

1617.84 --> 1623.52
that i've noticed because math

1620.799 --> 1625.039
is a separate thing you can switch to so

1623.52 --> 1626.4
if you can switch or you can

1625.039 --> 1627.279
simultaneously

1626.4 --> 1629.2
run

1627.279 --> 1632.24
dual core process it

1629.2 --> 1635.6000000000001
things then yeah that makes math very

1632.24 --> 1637.84
attainable if you're good at it

1635.6 --> 1640.1589999999999
right

1637.84 --> 1643.1999999999998
so i'm certainly living up to the title

1640.159 --> 1643.2
i gave today's show

1647.36 --> 1651.6789999999999
do you have your motor skills when

1649.039 --> 1651.679
you're split

1653.36 --> 1657.36
limited

1655.44 --> 1662.159
but i mean your motor skills are

1657.36 --> 1664.08
effectively also split off systems

1662.159 --> 1665.8400000000001
right what i'm talking about is

1664.08 --> 1668.799
splitting off your

1665.84 --> 1670.559
multitasking system not for like oh but

1668.799 --> 1672.72
doing something with your body and

1670.559 --> 1675.12
yapping about something

1672.72 --> 1676.799
at the same time and listening

1675.12 --> 1680.6399999999999
no instead it is

1676.799 --> 1683.36
acting and then at the same time

1680.64 --> 1685.6000000000001
keep going without breaking the flow or

1683.36 --> 1688.399
or the energy of what you're doing

1685.6 --> 1692.4399999999998
but then still analyze exactly what

1688.399 --> 1692.4399999999998
you're doing simultaneously

1692.799 --> 1699.44
yeah it requires some mental gymnastic

1695.44 --> 1701.279
skills usually some training

1699.44 --> 1704.24
to get it right

1701.279 --> 1704.24
unless you're a natural

1706.559 --> 1711.36
right but when i analyze myself as i'm

1709.76 --> 1713.679
performing

1711.36 --> 1715.039
then i usually don't have a lot of focus

1713.679 --> 1719.799
left for

1715.039 --> 1719.799
yeah motorist skill so

1737.039 --> 1740.0
escape to something

1738.88 --> 1742.3200000000002
right

1740.0 --> 1746.72
escape to heaven

1742.32 --> 1746.72
i've had that impulse too in dreams

1748.24 --> 1752.3990000000001
it's like this idea that if you just

1750.24 --> 1756.08
reach the highest spot

1752.399 --> 1757.76
that you can then lift off

1756.08 --> 1761.12
even if it doesn't actually happen in a

1757.76 --> 1764.1589999999999
dream usually the dream just ends there

1761.12 --> 1764.1589999999999
but that idea

1764.88 --> 1768.5590000000002
is that what you're talking about at

1766.159 --> 1768.5590000000002
least g

1771.279 --> 1776.399
or is it fleeing from something else

1778.48 --> 1782.72
get to the high ground that could also

1780.399 --> 1782.7199999999998
be it

1785.52 --> 1789.2
what

1786.72 --> 1790.72
dutch soldier is getting shot no didn't

1789.2 --> 1793.72
hear about what the hell are you talking

1790.72 --> 1793.72
about

1799.52 --> 1801.84
hmm

1803.279 --> 1806.6
okay lucy

1830.399 --> 1833.399
what

1847.919 --> 1853.159
around 3 30 okay

1873.519 --> 1877.72
okay that's not a lot of data

1881.039 --> 1888.1589999999999
it might just as well be a crisis act

1885.44 --> 1888.159
to be fair

1889.919 --> 1894.64
but

1891.679 --> 1896.64
yeah i know i hadn't hadn't picked up on

1894.64 --> 1900.1200000000001
that before

1896.64 --> 1900.1200000000001
steamy traveler

1919.6 --> 1927.0
dude what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

1921.679 --> 1927.0
about the mk 2020 that's ridiculous

1957.6 --> 1960.6
uh

1992.64 --> 1996.72
dude i don't even know what what that

1994.96 --> 1998.96
could have been i mean that could have

1996.72 --> 1998.96
been

2001.519 --> 2005.2
they could have been set up they might

2003.36 --> 2006.9599999999998
even have been thinking that they were

2005.2 --> 2010.159
like part of a movie

2006.96 --> 2010.159
scene or something and

2010.24 --> 2012.88
and

2011.76 --> 2015.519
then

2012.88 --> 2017.44
the opposing actors turned out to re use

2015.519 --> 2020.24
real bullets and then

2017.44 --> 2023.039
it was a setup i i don't know man

2020.24 --> 2023.039
i don't know

2026.159 --> 2029.2
but

2027.279 --> 2033.44
on the surface it sounds extremely

2029.2 --> 2036.44
suspicious especially around 3 30

2033.44 --> 2036.44
really

2056.879 --> 2062.7999999999997
no dmk 2020 why the [ __ ] would i do that

2064.24 --> 2070.1189999999997
like why the hell would i do that

2110.0 --> 2115.599
extreme video obviously always lies

2113.52 --> 2118.72
yeah and it's not just that they also

2115.599 --> 2121.76
coordinate the lies

2118.72 --> 2124.8799999999997
like all these mainstream media groups

2121.76 --> 2127.599
internationally coordinate

2124.88 --> 2127.599
shared lies

2128.72 --> 2133.1189999999997
gotta realize that too so it's like oh

2130.72 --> 2134.7999999999997
this and that and that one all reported

2133.119 --> 2137.2000000000003
on it

2134.8 --> 2139.8390000000004
and it's all the same kind of vague

2137.2 --> 2142.0
nonsense okay that means it's probably a

2139.839 --> 2143.52
coordinated crisis

2142.0 --> 2145.92
crisis act

2143.52 --> 2148.32
that's how i see it

2145.92 --> 2150.32
that's how it just falls into place in

2148.32 --> 2153.32
my mind every time i read anything like

2150.32 --> 2153.32
that

2163.44 --> 2167.599
i mean

2164.32 --> 2169.76
nobody's there wasn't even any specifics

2167.599 --> 2171.3590000000004
in the article you linked to

2169.76 --> 2174.32
about

2171.359 --> 2177.7599999999998
like who or what shot them

2174.32 --> 2179.6800000000003
not even a hint it's just dutch soldiers

2177.76 --> 2181.44
getting shot

2179.68 --> 2183.359
they're going to the hospital oh they're

2181.44 --> 2185.52
in critical that that's it

2183.359 --> 2189.52
it doesn't even say like

2185.52 --> 2189.52
what shot them who shot them

2191.04 --> 2197.04
there's a lot of shootings going on

2194.88 --> 2198.96
they do mention that so why would they

2197.04 --> 2203.04
do that is it because

2198.96 --> 2206.32
of a certain skin color variety

2203.04 --> 2208.96
do they have a very specific skin color

2206.32 --> 2212.96
variety problem over there and they're

2208.96 --> 2214.48
all frantically trying to censor it

2212.96 --> 2216.8
is that

2214.48 --> 2219.599
why there wasn't even a mention of who

2216.8 --> 2220.96
or what did it

2219.599 --> 2224.92
could be

2220.96 --> 2224.92
if it was even real

2232.0 --> 2234.4
i mean

2240.72 --> 2243.839
i don't know

2257.359 --> 2262.0
you would yell

2259.76 --> 2264.48
at cars that passed by to try and change

2262.0 --> 2264.48
the outcome

2265.68 --> 2268.96
right

2266.48 --> 2271.119
well i don't do that i can get very

2268.96 --> 2273.44
intense to try and change to try and

2271.119 --> 2275.76
change the outcome and

2273.44 --> 2278.2400000000002
with mixed results it's really all

2275.76 --> 2280.2400000000002
dependent on just what type of energy is

2278.24 --> 2282.7999999999997
blowing by

2280.24 --> 2285.4399999999996
sometimes it works instantaneously and

2282.8 --> 2287.52
other times it just really really does

2285.44 --> 2287.52
it

2289.44 --> 2292.88
but yeah i'm not gonna yell out in

2291.52 --> 2295.119
public

2292.88 --> 2297.04
i never do that

2295.119 --> 2299.76
i'm gonna yell i'm gonna do it behind

2297.04 --> 2302.88
closed door so that only i can hear how

2299.76 --> 2302.88
freaking loud it is

2306.079 --> 2311.52
because i don't like to be a baller to

2308.16 --> 2313.839
other people i really hate people

2311.52 --> 2314.8
that make noise and bother other people

2313.839 --> 2316.72
with it

2314.8 --> 2317.8390000000004
so i don't want to do that to other

2316.72 --> 2322.2
people

2317.839 --> 2322.2
i mean it's only logical

2341.52 --> 2343.92
anyway

2351.599 --> 2356.32
right

2352.72 --> 2358.8799999999997
i had a lot a very uh dreamwalking like

2356.32 --> 2363.52
boost at the beginning because of

2358.88 --> 2363.52
impromptu question with impromptu answer

2364.72 --> 2369.7599999999998
but overall i am kind

2366.839 --> 2372.0
of tired

2369.76 --> 2377.44
this is which is weird because i went to

2372.0 --> 2377.44
bed extremely early like 12 o'clock

2378.079 --> 2382.88
and i got up pretty early but i just

2380.24 --> 2385.839
felt

2382.88 --> 2388.839
like tired and i can't sleep

2385.839 --> 2388.839
weird

2397.04 --> 2402.0
okay but if i can focus long enough then

2399.119 --> 2405.7200000000003
i can still have some interesting

2402.0 --> 2405.72
things to share

2411.68 --> 2417.7999999999997
all right also before this i was

2413.839 --> 2417.7999999999997
watching some videos

2424.8 --> 2428.079
there's been a lot of little videos and

2426.72 --> 2431.04
i commented

2428.079 --> 2434.76
yesterday was imaginary curve life

2431.04 --> 2434.7599999999998
i was watching that

2439.44 --> 2445.76
lots of mr cheswick and

2442.56 --> 2448.88
michael khan videos and

2445.76 --> 2448.88
yeah rachey's video

2451.76 --> 2456.48
michael khan is just really likes

2454.079 --> 2458.6400000000003
spreeing with

2456.48 --> 2461.839
different types of videos

2458.64 --> 2461.839
it's going ballistic

2465.28 --> 2472.1600000000003
and yeah i watched back

2467.599 --> 2476.1600000000003
a video from space busters on bit shoot

2472.16 --> 2478.16
hadn't seen this specific one before

2476.16 --> 2480.16
where he basically is

2478.16 --> 2483.04
talking about

2480.16 --> 2485.2
well how viruses and bacteria

2483.04 --> 2487.119
are yeah viruses don't exist and

2485.2 --> 2489.2799999999997
bacteria are not what they say they are

2487.119 --> 2489.28
and

2489.92 --> 2496.16
he got over like a couple an older

2492.88 --> 2498.8
couple he's his own age

2496.16 --> 2501.2
doctors i think and they had a book

2498.8 --> 2503.3590000000004
about it that's really great

2501.2 --> 2506.319
about you could say terrain theory and

2503.359 --> 2506.319
they talk about that

2506.4 --> 2511.52
for like two hours

2509.359 --> 2513.839
so

2511.52 --> 2518.319
if you're interested in seeing anything

2513.839 --> 2520.839
like that like detailed medical talk

2518.319 --> 2523.2799999999997
about well the alternative way of

2520.839 --> 2525.359
approach and like what makes you will

2523.28 --> 2527.119
that's also the theme of the video what

2525.359 --> 2530.0
actually makes you ill

2527.119 --> 2531.6800000000003
like really what is the cause of disease

2530.0 --> 2534.4
or real

2531.68 --> 2537.5989999999997
and these this couple did some real deep

2534.4 --> 2541.52
research i'm only

2537.599 --> 2544.319
like 45 minutes in but it yeah

2541.52 --> 2545.7599999999998
it's a it's an easy tempo but it's

2544.319 --> 2547.599
really

2545.76 --> 2549.28
really informative

2547.599 --> 2551.6800000000003
i definitely recommend you check that

2549.28 --> 2554.3190000000004
out

2551.68 --> 2557.1189999999997
for that specific direction

2554.319 --> 2557.119
of subjects

2559.119 --> 2563.44
nathan thompson's

2560.88 --> 2565.839
letter good saints oh god

2563.44 --> 2570.0
modern day debate

2565.839 --> 2570.0
amy and jump what the

2574.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
okay pse net

2577.44 --> 2579.839
huh

2594.88 --> 2597.92
all right

2595.839 --> 2599.839
many of you guys by the way looked into

2597.92 --> 2601.839
owen benjamin

2599.839 --> 2604.56
the stream was like

2601.839 --> 2607.119
he's continuing in on it but now he's

2604.56 --> 2610.319
like bringing out this

2607.119 --> 2610.319
trump conspiracy

2610.72 --> 2614.3999999999996
it's really something else

2615.2 --> 2620.48
i mean

2616.88 --> 2623.2000000000003
he might be really calling it like i'm

2620.48 --> 2626.96
very nervous it makes me nervous this

2623.2 --> 2629.4399999999996
concept like it makes me really nervous

2626.96 --> 2629.44
and that's

2636.72 --> 2640.9599999999996
it would definitely be worth like

2639.52 --> 2644.319
looking through

2640.96 --> 2645.68
his data that he gathered up about it

2644.319 --> 2650.88
talks about

2645.68 --> 2650.8799999999997
like on the thursday and friday shows

2652.64 --> 2657.2799999999997
i'm still puzzled over all that i

2655.04 --> 2661.16
actually watched a part of the stream

2657.28 --> 2661.1600000000003
back like twice

2662.48 --> 2666.079
anybody has anybody watch that

2672.24 --> 2678.64
right so he's basically saying

2674.8 --> 2678.6400000000003
and it's not a joke actually

2679.599 --> 2684.079
that

2680.48 --> 2687.44
trump may have literally been the one

2684.079 --> 2688.88
that did 9 11.

2687.44 --> 2691.119
it's

2688.88 --> 2694.8
really shocking

2691.119 --> 2694.8
the way he put it all together

2699.599 --> 2702.4
like

2700.64 --> 2703.5989999999997
he's been friends

2702.4 --> 2707.6800000000003
like

2703.599 --> 2710.0
like deep friends with every single

2707.68 --> 2714.0789999999997
involved party

2710.0 --> 2714.079
with 911 it's unbelievable

2714.64 --> 2719.7599999999998
like with the building owners and all

2716.56 --> 2722.64
that like dude it's

2719.76 --> 2726.079
and like his uncle

2722.64 --> 2729.68
was the one who i guess officially

2726.079 --> 2733.44
was the person that confiscated

2729.68 --> 2735.5989999999997
nikola tesla's technology

2733.44 --> 2736.7200000000003
among which was

2735.599 --> 2741.44
well

2736.72 --> 2745.2799999999997
a technology to literally use resonance

2741.44 --> 2747.92
to turn anything into dust

2745.28 --> 2750.4
like to literally make aries to turn

2747.92 --> 2752.56
something to dust to just crumble it

2750.4 --> 2755.44
even though was steel or concrete it

2752.56 --> 2758.72
will just literally crumble to dust

2755.44 --> 2758.7200000000003
it's unbelievable

2759.52 --> 2766.0
and that's literally

2762.24 --> 2770.2799999999997
in the possession of the trump family

2766.0 --> 2770.28
and like what the [ __ ] man

2781.119 --> 2786.319
yeah and he pushed backs

2783.44 --> 2788.96
and a lot of annoying [ __ ] and it'll

2786.319 --> 2792.56
dude even in on infowars they're even

2788.96 --> 2795.359
now rolling the [ __ ] out like greg reese

2792.56 --> 2795.359
made a video

2795.839 --> 2802.72
completely about trump and just how

2798.88 --> 2806.0
how he's probably one of them one of the

2802.72 --> 2806.0
globalists for real

2809.68 --> 2812.3999999999996
i'll share it

2812.8 --> 2819.28
it's called the trump vaccine so

2817.2 --> 2822.0
it's a very typical not a long report

2819.28 --> 2823.76
very typical infowars so

2822.0 --> 2826.8
but yeah

2823.76 --> 2830.6800000000003
it's a there is something happening

2826.8 --> 2830.6800000000003
the waters are changing

2834.56 --> 2841.7999999999997
when you hear gregory's infowars video

2837.28 --> 2841.8
you [ __ ] your pants why

2845.68 --> 2849.9199999999996
i mean over at the infowars crew i just

2848.079 --> 2852.88
happen to know that there are a whole

i mean he's like a proud woman abuser

3139.359 --> 3145.7599999999998
and he literally

3142.319 --> 3149.04
pretends to be somebody else to

3145.76 --> 3151.2000000000003
to manipulate people online to give them

3149.04 --> 3153.119
their entire life savings

3151.2 --> 3154.96
he robbed people of hundreds of

3153.119 --> 3156.96
thousands of dollars

3154.96 --> 3159.44
by pretending to be somebody else and

3156.96 --> 3163.28

3179.68 --> 3183.96
with a tombstone on top

3195.68 --> 3201.5989999999997
he's a pimp you may say yeah and that

3197.68 --> 3201.5989999999997
makes him a disgusting human being

3203.2 --> 3210.5589999999997
definitely not highly inspirational

3206.559 --> 3212.8
it's a manipulative sociopath

3210.559 --> 3215.8

3323.2 --> 3327.839
repulsive from the very first second i

3325.44 --> 3328.799
saw him and didn't even know what he'd

3327.839 --> 3333.2799999999997

3383.2 --> 3387.68
from lonely people online that are

3385.44 --> 3391.52
idiots

3387.68 --> 3393.7599999999998
right by pretending to be a woman

3391.52 --> 3393.7599999999998
okay

3393.839 --> 3399.2

3395.28 --> 3401.76

don't you get it

3481.119 --> 3484.48
don't you [ __ ] get it

3486.319 --> 3489.839
because of that attitude

3508.88 --> 3514.7200000000003
hardcore support from youth

whatever the hell they are they're not

3525.04 --> 3531.839
even nazis they're just weirdo

3528.0 --> 3531.839
neo right winger idiots

3532.319 --> 3536.16

oh that's just brilliant

3548.4 --> 3551.359
yeah toy linda

3551.44 --> 3554.64
that was part of my point

3557.359 --> 3562.16
i mean

3559.2 --> 3564.96
in my opinion somebody that literally

3562.16 --> 3567.2
promotes that sort of thing

3564.96 --> 3568.48
could be considered a

3567.2 --> 3570.3999999999996
how do you say

3568.48 --> 3572.48
groomer

3570.4 --> 3574.2400000000002
yeah

3572.48 --> 3576.079
a groomer

3574.24 --> 3578.3999999999996
yeah

3576.079 --> 3581.28
it's a groomer of women

3578.4 --> 3584.319
abusive groomer

3581.28 --> 3585.76
and he literally trains his followers

3584.319 --> 3588.0
how to be

3585.76 --> 3592.079
a woman groomer

3588.0 --> 3592.079
to abuse them like furniture

3593.04 --> 3595.359
great

3596.88 --> 3601.0
that's just [ __ ] great

3620.24 --> 3624.24
her name heard him say that well i did

3622.64 --> 3626.5589999999997
hear him say that you know how he heard

3624.24 --> 3629.4399999999996
him say that through the frequency of

3626.559 --> 3632.7200000000003
his voice when i heard him for the very

3629.44 --> 3635.68
very first time i could hear it in his

3632.72 --> 3639.839
voice he is relentless

3635.68 --> 3643.7599999999998
he's he is really behind that this guy

3639.839 --> 3646.24
is like a slave trader type

3643.76 --> 3649.0400000000004
you can never convince a slave trader

3646.24 --> 3651.5989999999997
type to give up

3649.04 --> 3654.839
that way of doing things

3651.599 --> 3658.2400000000002
that guy's never gonna see women as is

3654.839 --> 3661.44
equal on any level socially i mean

3658.24 --> 3662.4799999999996
they're not literally are equal

3661.44 --> 3665.92
they're

3662.48 --> 3667.2
the other side of them of the coin

3665.92 --> 3670.16
men and women

3667.2 --> 3672.8799999999997
they're different and socially i prefer

3670.16 --> 3674.0
if men be the more dominant dominating

3672.88 --> 3676.1600000000003
party

3674.0 --> 3678.079
but that doesn't mean you should enslave

3676.16 --> 3678.96
women and turn them

3678.079 --> 3681.92
into

3678.96 --> 3685.799
husks and furniture to do exactly what

3681.92 --> 3685.799
you say that is monstrous

3686.16 --> 3691.2799999999997
who is worse him or jordan peterson

3688.799 --> 3691.28
jesus

3694.24 --> 3698.799
they're both horrific in different ways

3696.799 --> 3700.799
with different target groups i mean

3698.799 --> 3703.799
jordan peterson does not have a youth

3700.799 --> 3703.799
following

3716.559 --> 3720.3190000000004
oh right yeah clutch

3724.319 --> 3728.72
hey suzy good to see you robin stanley

3727.28 --> 3733.1600000000003
hey

3728.72 --> 3733.16
it's been a while how are you doing

3753.599 --> 3759.6800000000003
jordan peterson is

3755.599 --> 3759.6800000000003
unaware about why is that funny

3760.16 --> 3765.839
i mean you have any have any idea how

3762.319 --> 3765.839
much damage he causes

3766.839 --> 3772.4
territory mean if he was like if jordan

3770.0 --> 3773.52
peterson was just like sean hawkins

3772.4 --> 3775.92
right

3773.52 --> 3778.48
then it's harmless because

3775.92 --> 3780.64
sean hawk everybody knows he's an idiot

3778.48 --> 3783.839
like even the people that he thinks are

3780.64 --> 3786.48
his friends knows he is an idiot

3783.839 --> 3787.839
so it's not going to do any real damage

3786.48 --> 3790.88
but yeah

3787.839 --> 3793.2799999999997
uh jordan peterson is give being given a

3790.88 --> 3795.839
really big platform

3793.28 --> 3798.6400000000003
he probably got hundreds if not

3795.839 --> 3802.0
thousands of people killed

3798.64 --> 3802.0
killed with a k

3802.24 --> 3805.5989999999997
yeah whatever

3803.599 --> 3808.1600000000003
through

3805.599 --> 3810.799
this stupid lectures that cost like

3808.16 --> 3813.44
hundreds of dollars and you had to be

3810.799 --> 3816.16
vaccinated he actually forced that on

3813.44 --> 3819.599
his own lecture followers

3816.16 --> 3821.5989999999997
he got he got his own people killed

3819.599 --> 3823.3590000000004
because of his [ __ ] okay sean

3821.599 --> 3825.76
hawkins is never gonna do that kind of

3823.359 --> 3827.2799999999997
damage

3825.76 --> 3829.28
you know

3827.28 --> 3832.0
i don't really think jordan peterson is

3829.28 --> 3833.039
funny i like how jim bob makes fun of

3832.0 --> 3835.2
him

3833.039 --> 3837.119
but anything about the jordan peterson

3835.2 --> 3838.64
does not make me laugh

3837.119 --> 3841.92
i find him just

3838.64 --> 3841.92
a disgusting idiot

3844.72 --> 3850.5589999999997
he's just a delusional wannabe

3847.039 --> 3852.079
intellectual and his ideas are not that

3850.559 --> 3855.3590000000004
great

3852.079 --> 3855.3590000000004
they really are not

3859.2 --> 3865.5989999999997
i think that the average cohesion and

3862.88 --> 3868.559
quality and depth of what comes out of

3865.599 --> 3870.1600000000003
me is like at least three times better

3868.559 --> 3873.28
than what comes out of him and now i'm

3870.16 --> 3873.2799999999997
downplaying myself

3874.799 --> 3878.079
also it's [ __ ]

3878.839 --> 3882.92
boring boring

3894.4 --> 3897.6800000000003
no he's not happy

3897.92 --> 3900.64
ridiculous

3901.68 --> 3906.0
he's not anything

3903.599 --> 3909.28
i mean i'm pretty sure that he's he's

3906.0 --> 3910.96
just like a fruity old hipster

3909.28 --> 3912.4
and if you're going to ask him like oh

3910.96 --> 3913.2
flutter earth globe earth he's just

3912.4 --> 3915.44
going to

3913.2 --> 3917.359
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it

3915.44 --> 3919.28
doesn't really matter where you're at

3917.359 --> 3921.44
and so that he doesn't have to answer

3919.28 --> 3923.52
because he's a sniffling piece of [ __ ]

3921.44 --> 3926.0
coward

3923.52 --> 3927.44
he likes to techno blabber his way out

3926.0 --> 3932.52
of everything

3927.44 --> 3932.52
so he doesn't have to answer anything

3941.839 --> 3947.16
right

3942.96 --> 3947.16
a hipster godzilla

3952.0 --> 3956.559
jordan peterson always sounds like he's

3953.839 --> 3956.5589999999997
about to cry

3991.2 --> 3996.64
peterson worked with the um

3994.559 --> 3999.44
not surprised at all

3996.64 --> 4001.52
i mean as i said before he is

3999.44 --> 4005.2400000000002
very connected

4001.52 --> 4005.24
that's not good

4006.16 --> 4009.2
not good for him

4009.359 --> 4013.4
he still thinks it is

4035.92 --> 4041.359
jp done a video on a fee

4039.039 --> 4041.3590000000004
and

4043.2 --> 4048.8799999999997
and was i right tony whitcomb

4046.64 --> 4051.52
about what i said that he would do

4048.88 --> 4054.1600000000003
because you know he would

4051.52 --> 4055.7599999999998
like that's just knowing about people so

4054.16 --> 4058.64
tell me did he

4055.76 --> 4060.88
just blabber on continually not leaving

4058.64 --> 4062.96
you the wiser as to what he actually

4060.88 --> 4064.079
believed and just made it all meta talk

4062.96 --> 4066.88
about

4064.079 --> 4068.48
philosophical weighing out

4066.88 --> 4070.799
and then all people will come to their

4068.48 --> 4072.88
own conclusions and eventually there

4070.799 --> 4074.559
will be a new generation that will

4072.88 --> 4076.4
believe the opposite again blah blah

4074.559 --> 4079.28
blah blah the things that i also like to

4076.4 --> 4083.119
talk about except i don't use them to

4079.28 --> 4085.3590000000004
avoid direct answers to questions like

4083.119 --> 4088.92
an ass

4085.359 --> 4088.92
jordan peterson

4096.719 --> 4101.12
because i know he knows about the swing

4098.56 --> 4103.4400000000005
of the pendulum but the oscillation he

4101.12 --> 4105.04
knows about that and he's just abusing

4103.44 --> 4107.2789999999995
that knowledge

4105.04 --> 4109.6
to dazzle people with at times so that

4107.279 --> 4114.52
he doesn't actually have to answer

4109.6 --> 4114.52
questions that's what he does

4124.08 --> 4129.359
so tell me tony

4126.319 --> 4133.0
i'm not asking you why he did that just

4129.359 --> 4133.0
what it was

4134.08 --> 4139.759
what did he actually say did he blabber

4137.279 --> 4141.4400000000005
around it philosophically talking about

4139.759 --> 4143.199
oh flat earth versus globe oh it's

4141.44 --> 4145.599999999999
always going to come back one way or

4143.199 --> 4148.08
another and

4145.6 --> 4149.679
so that he didn't actually have to say

4148.08 --> 4152.88
yeah i am

4149.679 --> 4152.88
not a flood earther

4154.239 --> 4159.12
probably tried to avoid that

4157.04 --> 4160.56
so stop keeping me a suspense tony

4159.12 --> 4163.719
whitcomb

4160.56 --> 4163.719
tell me

4196.32 --> 4202.599999999999
he did a diagram and explained the globe

4198.56 --> 4202.6
don't make sense really

4203.199 --> 4205.759999999999
that's it

4209.6 --> 4214.4800000000005
he didn't say oh i think it's flat

4212.64 --> 4216.400000000001
did he go there

4214.48 --> 4219.199
they i mean that would be extremely

4216.4 --> 4219.199
unexpected

4223.6 --> 4227.76
i already didn't really expect him to do

4225.52 --> 4230.0
anything like this i thought it was just

4227.76 --> 4233.2390000000005
philosophically blabber around it all

4230.0 --> 4233.239
day long

4267.12 --> 4271.04
right

4268.719 --> 4272.96
anyways

4271.04 --> 4275.44
i didn't know

4272.96 --> 4278.96
maybe when did he do that did he do that

4275.44 --> 4278.96
like two years ago

4280.96 --> 4285.52
something like that

4283.36 --> 4289.44
i mean if he he might have done it as

4285.52 --> 4291.4400000000005
like a virtue signal in a peak moment

4289.44 --> 4293.199
and flat earth was really hitting a lot

4291.44 --> 4295.04
of snares probably when like owen

4293.199 --> 4297.759999999999
benjamin came out with it

4295.04 --> 4300.96
it's a real high flat earth peak in

4297.76 --> 4303.679
energy out there and he might have just

4300.96 --> 4305.36
tried to jump on that for just one video

4303.679 --> 4307.6
and then he never talks about it ever

4305.36 --> 4307.599999999999
again

4308.08 --> 4312.5599999999995
that could also be it

4310.56 --> 4315.6
like a virtue signal that he doesn't

4312.56 --> 4318.88
actually really stand behind

4315.6 --> 4320.88
when further inquired i don't know man i

4318.88 --> 4323.12
to be fair i don't actually watch

4320.88 --> 4325.6
anything of his

4323.12 --> 4328.32
the the few moments that i do know and

4325.6 --> 4329.92
the indirect analysis from other people

4328.32 --> 4333.599999999999
that i know

4329.92 --> 4337.2390000000005
like how they read into people

4333.6 --> 4337.2390000000005
i've learned enough

4353.04 --> 4357.4
about a year ago hmm

4360.719 --> 4363.84
okay

4361.6 --> 4366.4800000000005
could you find that anywhere is that

4363.84 --> 4368.08
anywhere like online on youtube or

4366.48 --> 4371.839999999999
something

4368.08 --> 4371.84
i'd like to check that out actually

4372.88 --> 4376.56
what an odd moment to do that

4377.36 --> 4383.32
the end of 2021

4379.76 --> 4383.320000000001
like why

4408.719 --> 4411.719
huh

4445.52 --> 4449.92
hmm

4447.199 --> 4453.48
yeah getting wisdom

4449.92 --> 4453.4800000000005
that's what it is

4469.36 --> 4473.639999999999
ah man getting hungry

4484.719 --> 4487.719
okay

4521.199 --> 4525.839999999999
right so anyway it's a long enough pause

4528.32 --> 4532.239
uh

4529.199 --> 4534.239
what can we talk about

4532.239 --> 4536.718999999999
i mean jordan peterson is not really

4534.239 --> 4538.799999999999
that interesting a subject unless

4536.719 --> 4540.56
somebody links me up

4538.8 --> 4542.2390000000005
to that specific video where he

4540.56 --> 4543.280000000001
supposedly uh

4542.239 --> 4545.199
said

4543.28 --> 4547.84
or did a presentation about how the

4545.199 --> 4550.639999999999
globe earth doesn't make any sense

4547.84 --> 4555.56
be interested in checking that out

4550.64 --> 4555.56
other other than that not so much

4575.6 --> 4581.719
wow elishi what the did where did you

4578.48 --> 4581.718999999999
get that

4598.64 --> 4602.8
yeah that did to take real effort

4604.96 --> 4609.84
that's some serious nerd poetry right

4607.36 --> 4609.839999999999
there

4623.44 --> 4627.759999999999
it took to three days

4625.679 --> 4629.84
wow you actually made that yourself that

4627.76 --> 4632.84
is pretty impressive

4629.84 --> 4632.84
cool

4657.6 --> 4661.280000000001
now suzy s gave you a medal

4662.4 --> 4667.5199999999995
okay hello scott what about jordan

4664.88 --> 4667.52
peterson

4674.4 --> 4677.44
people are losing their ability to think

4676.32 --> 4679.28
like this

4677.44 --> 4681.28
i don't think so robin stanley i don't

4679.28 --> 4682.719
think they're really losing it they're

4681.28 --> 4683.679
just

4682.719 --> 4685.52
not

4683.679 --> 4688.0
doing it

4685.52 --> 4690.2390000000005
they're just

4688.0 --> 4693.199
they gave it up because they think they

4690.239 --> 4695.04
don't need it anymore because society is

4693.199 --> 4698.5599999999995
so evolved

4695.04 --> 4701.44
that they that evolution would only

4698.56 --> 4703.04
naturally cause them to become [ __ ]

4701.44 --> 4704.639999999999
and now they're embracing that

4703.04 --> 4706.4
retardation

4704.64 --> 4708.8
not realizing that

4706.4 --> 4711.839999999999
when you embrace that you actually do

4708.8 --> 4711.84
become [ __ ]

4714.88 --> 4721.12
it's like a decision you just make like

4717.44 --> 4722.5599999999995
oh i'm i'm too good

4721.12 --> 4725.44
to still just

4722.56 --> 4728.96
keep myself busy

4725.44 --> 4731.36
with smart things and art and word and

4728.96 --> 4732.4
poetry and [ __ ]

4731.36 --> 4734.799999999999
like

4732.4 --> 4735.759999999999
i don't need that anymore

4734.8 --> 4737.6
because

4735.76 --> 4739.92
i'm never bored now there's always

4737.6 --> 4742.2390000000005
computer games and

4739.92 --> 4745.36
[ __ ] people everywhere that'll just

4742.239 --> 4746.639999999999
do anything for a bit of attention like

4745.36 --> 4747.44
why would i

4746.64 --> 4749.76
just

4747.44 --> 4750.96
spend some time on your your own to do

4749.76 --> 4753.76
something

4750.96 --> 4755.6
a little complex you know that's really

4753.76 --> 4756.8
a big problem

4755.6 --> 4759.52
it's

4756.8 --> 4762.4800000000005
it's too much entertainment

4759.52 --> 4764.719
when entertainment is everywhere

4762.48 --> 4768.4
you don't get the opportunity to get

4764.719 --> 4769.92
bored because of your intelligence

4768.4 --> 4771.44
then you don't

4769.92 --> 4775.04
also get

4771.44 --> 4778.08
the opportunity to express and train

4775.04 --> 4781.44
that creativity

4778.08 --> 4782.5599999999995
right almost all art

4781.44 --> 4784.96
almost all

4782.56 --> 4786.96
kids that draw and [ __ ] in school that's

4784.96 --> 4789.199
always from boredom

4786.96 --> 4791.84
that's where art skills usually tend to

4789.199 --> 4791.839999999999
come from

4791.92 --> 4796.2390000000005
if you're never doing that

4794.56 --> 4799.120000000001
because you're just like oh no i'll just

4796.239 --> 4801.678999999999
look at my mobile and play the latest

4799.12 --> 4804.4
stupid little game or whatever or check

4801.679 --> 4807.04
my messages on facebook yeah guess what

4804.4 --> 4809.28
it means you no longer have that that

4807.04 --> 4810.96
time where you're just locked in

4809.28 --> 4813.36
with your own mind

4810.96 --> 4817.2390000000005
doing something interesting

4813.36 --> 4817.239
you lose that then

4822.239 --> 4824.48
right

4831.199 --> 4839.5199999999995
easy entertainment wherever you go

4835.199 --> 4841.599999999999
literally makes you lose your mind

4839.52 --> 4843.679
lose the grip

4841.6 --> 4846.08
on your own mind

4843.679 --> 4848.159
because to get grip on your own mind you

4846.08 --> 4849.679
need training

4848.159 --> 4852.879999999999
for training

4849.679 --> 4856.0
you actually surprisingly need

4852.88 --> 4858.32
silence and space what most people would

4856.0 --> 4862.719
associate with boredom

4858.32 --> 4862.719
that's where creativity tends to start

4871.679 --> 4878.2390000000005
if you never get bored then

4874.639 --> 4878.2390000000005
you don't develop any of that

4884.719 --> 4887.719
right

4895.52 --> 4898.2390000000005
all right in a way you could even say

4897.28 --> 4900.96
that

4898.239 --> 4903.36
even legos can do that if you're just

4900.96 --> 4907.04
always only doing things with legos then

4903.36 --> 4908.48
that means you're not doing other things

4907.04 --> 4910.96
so those other things you could have

4908.48 --> 4913.04
been doing might have developed your

4910.96 --> 4914.8
skills in different directions now you

4913.04 --> 4918.4
only got

4914.8 --> 4922.320000000001
skills that you can attain from legos

4918.4 --> 4924.879999999999
right it's basically the same thing

4922.32 --> 4927.599999999999
but i see legos as a much better

4924.88 --> 4931.28
distraction especially when you're young

4927.6 --> 4934.320000000001
than for example a game boy or in these

4931.28 --> 4939.159
days a mobile phone

4934.32 --> 4939.159
no legos is a lot better than that

4950.32 --> 4955.199
yeah like that ai that creates art from

4952.239 --> 4957.199
text prompt yeah that's the next stage

4955.199 --> 4959.12
let's see

4957.199 --> 4962.239
i mean it's amazing

4959.12 --> 4964.32
but it will also strip away

4962.239 --> 4968.4
motivation for a whole bunch of people

4964.32 --> 4968.4
to actually just start painting

4971.04 --> 4975.12
because you don't need to anymore you

4972.96 --> 4978.159
just fill in a couple of

4975.12 --> 4979.28
sentences and there it is

4978.159 --> 4982.92
well that's

4979.28 --> 4982.92
monstrous really

4987.04 --> 4992.0
i mean you're never going to develop

4988.96 --> 4994.8
your own unique distinct style

4992.0 --> 4999.159
by doing that you see never it's always

4994.8 --> 4999.159000000001
going to be the machine style

5000.88 --> 5005.1990000000005
with their heads

5002.15 --> 5008.48
[Music]

5005.199 --> 5009.28
i think that there should just be

5008.48 --> 5011.44
like

5009.28 --> 5014.0
information tags on these types of

5011.44 --> 5017.12
things it's like oh if you actually want

5014.0 --> 5020.4
to learn how to paint and all that

5017.12 --> 5020.4
then don't use this

5022.32 --> 5030.239
like a what do you call it a

5025.6 --> 5030.2390000000005
like a default warning a

5034.4 --> 5037.199
a disclaimer

5036.0 --> 5039.36
whatever

5037.199 --> 5042.36
you guys know what i mean just a little

5039.36 --> 5042.36
warning

5042.4 --> 5046.4
hey voynich

5044.719 --> 5049.28
a little late

5046.4 --> 5049.28
not very late

5052.32 --> 5057.04
i was a little late myself today

5055.28 --> 5060.0
yesterday i was really early but yeah

5057.04 --> 5060.0
today not so much

5067.8 --> 5072.639
expediency scratching creative so yeah

5072.719 --> 5077.28
you can't industrialize creativity

5079.92 --> 5087.32
it will always end up destroying itself

5083.36 --> 5087.32
and depleting inspiration

5111.92 --> 5114.88
correct yeah he was

5122.96 --> 5126.96
so yeah how are you all

5124.639 --> 5128.400000000001
holding out how's the weather over there

5126.96 --> 5131.04
i mean

5128.4 --> 5134.0
almost seems like summer is gonna make

5131.04 --> 5134.0
another comeback

5134.4 --> 5139.679
although this just this is like the type

5136.96 --> 5142.0
of weather it was in may just

5139.679 --> 5144.88
like spring weather it is kind of warm

5142.0 --> 5146.719
but not super hot

5144.88 --> 5149.52
so it's almost like it's back to spring

5146.719 --> 5151.44
again and i've seen butterflies still

5149.52 --> 5153.1990000000005
flying around also

5151.44 --> 5156.159
which i'm very glad of by the way that

5153.199 --> 5156.159
they're still out there

5156.8 --> 5161.6
right it's always something you got to

5158.88 --> 5161.6
keep track of

5162.719 --> 5168.08
butterflies and bees

5165.6 --> 5170.0
and especially when it's really watery

5168.08 --> 5171.92
area the frogs you always gotta keep

5170.0 --> 5174.4
track of how they're doing

5171.92 --> 5179.4
like those are the well

5174.4 --> 5179.4
canaries in the coal mine at all times

5185.92 --> 5191.36
north america we call that indian summer

5189.04 --> 5191.36
okay

5194.4 --> 5198.48
hey

5195.199 --> 5198.48
what's that tony witkin

5202.48 --> 5205.919999999999
ain't the best thanks

5206.159 --> 5209.159
hey

5212.88 --> 5218.0
flat earth theory

5215.52 --> 5218.0
wait what

5218.4 --> 5222.96
oh this guy

5219.76 --> 5224.639
yeah but he's not jordan peterson

5222.96 --> 5227.12
i know this guy he was really

5224.639 --> 5227.12
interesting

5234.48 --> 5238.199
yeah remember that

5238.48 --> 5242.239
i thought you were going to link me up

5240.159 --> 5246.08
with the jordan peterson video but this

5242.239 --> 5246.08
is not jordan peterson tony with him

5246.88 --> 5250.639
jp five years ago

5250.719 --> 5255.44
well this guy may have been doing like a

5252.88 --> 5259.04
parody but i'm pretty sure that this is

5255.44 --> 5259.04
not jordan peterson

5265.44 --> 5269.919999999999
unless he's also called jordan peterson

5268.56 --> 5272.8
i don't think we're talking about the

5269.92 --> 5272.8
same guy here

5276.88 --> 5282.08
but yeah this guy the red hat guy

5279.76 --> 5284.0
he's he's pretty awesome

5282.08 --> 5286.0
i have no idea he's also called jordan

5284.0 --> 5290.239
peterson is he really though

5286.0 --> 5293.239
it's just a jp here in his youtube

5290.239 --> 5293.239
name

5294.56 --> 5300.56
he's not enough here

5297.36 --> 5303.04
isn't he okay fine well his presentation

5300.56 --> 5305.6
though was like really

5303.04 --> 5305.6
excellent

5306.88 --> 5310.88
he might have been doing like a comedy

5308.639 --> 5313.28
sketch or something about it but it's

5310.88 --> 5315.84
like yeah that doesn't really matter all

5313.28 --> 5315.84
that much

5315.92 --> 5321.6
because yeah the information that he

5318.639 --> 5325.96
shared is pretty solid

5321.6 --> 5325.96
as far as i remember that is

5336.719 --> 5340.32
you never touch the yeah but usually

5339.28 --> 5342.48
they don't

5340.32 --> 5344.08
like either you do that and then you

5342.48 --> 5346.4
will be doing that

5344.08 --> 5348.88
or you just have like an episode about

5346.4 --> 5351.679
flatter like a virtue signal or

5348.88 --> 5353.679
something like you're showing that you

5351.679 --> 5355.28
at least get it

5353.679 --> 5356.719
you just don't really want to deal with

5355.28 --> 5361.4
it

5356.719 --> 5361.4
i mean lots of people out there do that

5381.12 --> 5384.12
hmm

5396.08 --> 5402.239
around because the other one doesn't

5397.44 --> 5404.32
know how to detect sarcasm yet yeah but

5402.239 --> 5407.28
this is so weird guys but look you're

5404.32 --> 5410.32
saying all that but

5407.28 --> 5410.32
i'm still around

5416.0 --> 5420.88
aren't i

5418.32 --> 5423.44
don't i have pretty pronounced

5420.88 --> 5426.32
views on things

5423.44 --> 5428.159
including the ones that are like

5426.32 --> 5429.759999999999
high-profile

5428.159 --> 5431.12
interests

5429.76 --> 5434.12
of people

5431.12 --> 5434.12
so

5436.159 --> 5440.08
if you start naming them

5442.96 --> 5447.679
well yeah i tend to overall avoid

5445.44 --> 5450.5599999999995
specific names

5447.679 --> 5452.96
especially when i get like rage win

5450.56 --> 5455.6
because that's just stupid to do that

5452.96 --> 5457.84
because i would never do that

5455.6 --> 5460.320000000001
really it's only something that's just

5457.84 --> 5461.76
an inspiration in the moment most of the

5460.32 --> 5464.239
time

5461.76 --> 5467.280000000001
and sometimes it is a long-term interest

5464.239 --> 5469.5199999999995
of mine to have like severe punishment

5467.28 --> 5469.5199999999995
but

5469.679 --> 5474.4800000000005
yeah it's it's pointless

5471.6 --> 5474.4800000000005
to name names

5474.639 --> 5479.84
i'm not a round earther

5477.199 --> 5479.839999999999
wait what

5480.48 --> 5484.48
how does that mix what

5483.44 --> 5487.28
wait so

5484.48 --> 5490.4
because i'm a flat earther i can now

5487.28 --> 5493.36
just say whatever the [ __ ] i want is

5490.4 --> 5493.36
that how it works

5494.0 --> 5498.76
what

5495.76 --> 5498.76
okay

5525.36 --> 5532.599999999999
2024 what takes off eric

5528.88 --> 5532.6
what are you talking about

5539.84 --> 5547.2390000000005
only the alt-right i don't even know

5542.0 --> 5547.239
what the [ __ ] the alt-right even is

5548.639 --> 5552.2390000000005
it just seems like a completely conjured

5551.12 --> 5555.04
rumor

5552.239 --> 5556.799999999999
like what the [ __ ] is an alt-right even

5555.04 --> 5559.8
supposed to be

5556.8 --> 5559.8
like

5564.48 --> 5569.36
i literally do not understand what the

5567.04 --> 5572.0
[ __ ] that's even supposed to be it's

5569.36 --> 5575.839999999999
just a title

5572.0 --> 5575.84
but it doesn't make any sense

5575.92 --> 5581.1990000000005
like how would you even know

5578.56 --> 5581.1990000000005
what that is

5583.84 --> 5588.4800000000005
so i'm safe then what because i don't

5586.159 --> 5590.799999999999
even know what the [ __ ] alt-right is

5588.48 --> 5592.879999999999
that means i'm safe

5590.8 --> 5595.679
okay

5592.88 --> 5599.12
so the problem would come when you say

5595.679 --> 5600.0
orban alt-right and then suddenly you

5599.12 --> 5603.12
get

5600.0 --> 5606.4
the shitty treatment

5603.12 --> 5608.48
why the [ __ ] would you say that though

5606.4 --> 5612.5199999999995
why

5608.48 --> 5612.5199999999995
how does that make any sense

5618.56 --> 5624.320000000001
but the alt-right names them

5622.0 --> 5624.32
what

5626.719 --> 5631.159
wait

5627.76 --> 5631.159000000001
wait what

5634.0 --> 5636.48
you mean

5637.6 --> 5645.4400000000005
if somebody that's declared alt-right

5641.92 --> 5646.719
declare somebody else alt right

5645.44 --> 5649.44
that's

5646.719 --> 5652.44
how they get banned

5649.44 --> 5652.44
what

5660.159 --> 5665.839999999999
okay but i'm safe now i guess so

5663.76 --> 5668.88
i just never really got it it's like

5665.84 --> 5670.719
what the [ __ ] is this alt-right [ __ ]

5668.88 --> 5672.400000000001
i just don't get it

5670.719 --> 5674.96
i don't even understand what it's

5672.4 --> 5676.719
supposed to be representing

5674.96 --> 5679.44
you really don't

5676.719 --> 5682.2390000000005
it's so ridiculous it's like this weird

5679.44 --> 5685.119
fantastical rumor like science fiction

5682.239 --> 5688.4
and nobody actually knows what it is

5685.119 --> 5688.4
like that's what it is to me

5690.8 --> 5696.52
like gravity nobody actually knows what

5693.36 --> 5696.5199999999995
it is

5700.719 --> 5702.88
ha

5706.32 --> 5711.719
you had a synchronicity there it's robin

5708.719 --> 5711.719
stanley

5728.639 --> 5732.88
daniel brat

5731.199 --> 5735.199
youtube bands

5732.88 --> 5739.159000000001
i don't understand algorithm

5735.199 --> 5739.159
who the [ __ ] is that

5743.119 --> 5750.199
is that somebody that basically declared

5745.6 --> 5750.1990000000005
themselves alt-right or something

5756.48 --> 5761.28
yeah i know he's a flat earth i

5757.92 --> 5761.28
recognize him that far but

5769.36 --> 5774.239
slag of right but the thing is though

5772.0 --> 5777.52
that it apparently has everything to do

5774.239 --> 5781.5199999999995
with you accepting it

5777.52 --> 5783.84
it's like if you say arm old right

5781.52 --> 5786.639
and then other people like are you an

5783.84 --> 5788.4800000000005
alt-right and you say yeah man

5786.639 --> 5792.719
that's when you get in trouble is that

5788.48 --> 5795.839999999999
it is it that really is it that simple

5792.719 --> 5795.84
is it that stupid

5796.719 --> 5801.52
wow

5798.88 --> 5803.679
so if you just get caught up in thinking

5801.52 --> 5804.639
like hey i am one of these old right

5803.679 --> 5807.1990000000005
guys

5804.639 --> 5811.36
that's how you get [ __ ]

5807.199 --> 5813.28
so it is basically like a fly trap then

5811.36 --> 5815.5199999999995
or a venus trap

5813.28 --> 5815.5199999999995
right

5815.92 --> 5819.52
isn't it

5817.04 --> 5823.679
it's just like oh

5819.52 --> 5823.679
i want to be one of these guys

5824.159 --> 5827.44
when you have no idea what the hell is

5825.76 --> 5830.0
going on and then as soon as you take

5827.44 --> 5830.0
the mark

5831.76 --> 5837.280000000001
yeah you just become treated like that

5834.8 --> 5838.96
mark then from there on on a very

5837.28 --> 5840.5599999999995
serious corporate level and you're

5838.96 --> 5843.76
totally [ __ ]

5840.56 --> 5847.1990000000005
so that you can attain some sort of

5843.76 --> 5850.4800000000005
internet victim status

5847.199 --> 5850.48
is that what it is

5850.8 --> 5855.639
i it's so confusing to me

5860.639 --> 5866.96
defining these unicorn terms is toxic

5864.719 --> 5868.88
yeah

5866.96 --> 5870.88
but i'm just trying to figure out like

5868.88 --> 5873.119
what the hell is even going on with that

5870.88 --> 5876.08
and like how people roll into that and

5873.119 --> 5877.599999999999
then like declare themselves outright

5876.08 --> 5879.28
and then they get screwed like i'm

5877.6 --> 5880.8
trying to understand what the hell is

5879.28 --> 5885.199
happening

5880.8 --> 5885.1990000000005
this is what why is that happening

5886.08 --> 5890.239
you don't get it

5887.52 --> 5890.2390000000005
it seems so

5895.52 --> 5899.4400000000005
it ridiculous be because all my videos

5897.76 --> 5900.639
are live

5899.44 --> 5903.5199999999995
really

5900.639 --> 5903.52
can is it though

5905.52 --> 5907.92
so but

5906.96 --> 5910.92
wait

5907.92 --> 5910.92
what

5911.44 --> 5914.759999999999
i don't know

5930.719 --> 5934.4
right but yeah you have a good point if

5932.56 --> 5936.8
you start like

5934.4 --> 5939.679
printing out names and photographs and

5936.8 --> 5941.92
say these are the evil ones

5939.679 --> 5945.76
yeah you probably get some

5941.92 --> 5945.76
very nervous attention from that

5946.56 --> 5949.96
i get it

5968.8 --> 5974.360000000001
they call it naming them

5971.36 --> 5974.36
okay

5980.08 --> 5984.5599999999995
right so about the list but that's so

5982.48 --> 5987.04
funny because i've even mentioned like

5984.56 --> 5989.280000000001
yeah lists there are lists there are

5987.04 --> 5991.44
lists that people know

5989.28 --> 5994.48
those are the actual scumbags that

5991.44 --> 5996.08
created all the death everywhere

5994.48 --> 5997.759999999999
and this is how they operate and this is

5996.08 --> 6000.719
how they're structured

5997.76 --> 6002.88
i mean and so the alt-right is the ones

6000.719 --> 6004.719
that are naming them and like putting

6002.88 --> 6006.719
them on screen like oh these are the

6004.719 --> 6009.04
bastards we gotta go get them somehow

6006.719 --> 6011.36
and

6009.04 --> 6011.36
right

6013.119 --> 6016.119
okay

6030.56 --> 6035.679
hey as the hard right wing always always

6033.04 --> 6038.32
been okay

6035.679 --> 6038.32
i don't know

6042.719 --> 6047.88
yeah these terms are a carousel right

6044.88 --> 6047.88
indeed

6050.639 --> 6055.4400000000005
that would be funny by the way

6052.8 --> 6057.76
what if you called yourself car roussel

6055.44 --> 6057.759999999999
right

6059.84 --> 6064.2390000000005
i mean that

6061.76 --> 6068.4800000000005
sort of like

6064.239 --> 6068.48
make a statement wouldn't it

6076.84 --> 6081.1990000000005
right wouldn't it like yeah i'm carousel

6080.0 --> 6083.04
right

6081.199 --> 6085.36
oh so that means you're literally

6083.04 --> 6086.4
everywhere yeah

6085.36 --> 6091.08
but i'm

6086.4 --> 6091.08
i'm right now i'm on the right

6099.76 --> 6104.639
so kind of like the republicans in the

6101.84 --> 6104.639
united states

6105.52 --> 6113.080000000001
they are or they definitely seem to

6108.08 --> 6113.08
behave like carousel right

6122.0 --> 6126.8
mason cinna can jesus right because it's

6124.56 --> 6131.719
it's not specific enough you can name

6126.8 --> 6131.719
that yeah and i have done so plenty

6141.679 --> 6147.56
why don't they just call it left wing

6143.679 --> 6147.56
very soft right

6157.119 --> 6162.0
i don't know i see it's just the left

6159.04 --> 6164.239
wing is just the wing that was left you

6162.0 --> 6164.239
know

6168.08 --> 6172.719
it's just the leftovers i mean that's

6170.48 --> 6174.0
what the left is it's leftovers all of

6172.719 --> 6174.84
it

6174.0 --> 6176.48
they're all

6174.84 --> 6177.84
leftovers

6176.48 --> 6180.0
they think that they're part of

6177.84 --> 6182.2390000000005
something that makes them more important

6180.0 --> 6184.88
than they are as leftovers

6182.239 --> 6189.159
but it's exactly the opposite

6184.88 --> 6189.159000000001
they're actually a detriment now

6200.639 --> 6207.679
right am appeal

6203.199 --> 6207.678999999999
yeah thanks for uh popping by

6291.199 --> 6296.678999999999
wait avengers inspired i didn't know

6293.679 --> 6296.679
that

6302.719 --> 6306.2390000000005
it's always nice to see a flower in a

6304.56 --> 6308.96
dungeon

6306.239 --> 6308.959999999999
that's dark

6310.88 --> 6314.1990000000005
but uh

6316.159 --> 6319.799999999999
it is nice

6331.04 --> 6337.119
british tv show

6333.52 --> 6339.4400000000005
oh that the avengers okay

6337.119 --> 6339.44

6343.199 --> 6347.44
called emma peel

6345.199 --> 6349.678999999999
that makes sense it was very it is a

6347.44 --> 6353.678999999999
very british

6349.679 --> 6356.2390000000005
yeah okay that makes sense i believe you

6353.679 --> 6358.4
i was trying to tie it in with marvel or

6356.239 --> 6362.199
something but it was the old adventure

6358.4 --> 6362.199
series now it makes sense

6382.719 --> 6385.719

6386.639 --> 6394.1990000000005
sixties woman fashion is the best what

6389.28 --> 6394.199

6429.76 --> 6434.96
oh okay gortzilla

6432.239 --> 6434.959999999999
cool thanks

6441.119 --> 6445.04
you don't trust videos unless they have

6443.44 --> 6448.159
those warnings

6445.04 --> 6448.159
okay toiling

6448.96 --> 6454.0
well i've got a couple of videos like

6450.8 --> 6456.159000000001
that but most of look i'm just a talking

6454.0 --> 6459.44
head most of the time i sometimes share

6456.159 --> 6463.119
a picture and i should drop some links

6459.44 --> 6466.5599999999995
but i'm not like a serious presentation

6463.119 --> 6468.4
type of video guy and and yeah

6466.56 --> 6470.400000000001
if you if you're not like that you

6468.4 --> 6472.32
usually don't get warning signs they

6470.4 --> 6474.159
only do that when they see oh this is

6472.32 --> 6475.36
actually a medical presentation or

6474.159 --> 6478.4
something right

6475.36 --> 6478.4
that's when they do that

6479.199 --> 6482.879999999999
so i

6480.239 --> 6485.839999999999

6841.199 --> 6846.879999999999
it's not in this description box

6844.639 --> 6849.679
not in the right upper corner is this

6846.88 --> 6852.56
like a mobile thing or something

6849.679 --> 6854.08
because i'm not getting any of these

6852.56 --> 6856.0
maybe it's because i still running

6854.08 --> 6858.639
windows 7

6856.0 --> 6862.92
and you're running on windows 11

6858.639 --> 6862.92
not probably not but

6865.679 --> 6870.4
fed wikipedia attack okay little i'm

6868.56 --> 6872.400000000001
gonna check out i'm gonna check out

6870.4 --> 6874.32
every single channel guys until i'm

6872.4 --> 6877.119
actually gonna find one of these silly

6874.32 --> 6880.32
wikipedias that i've never

6877.119 --> 6883.799999999999
ever seen before

6880.32 --> 6883.799999999999
i've been around

6900.96 --> 6906.4
okay let's go to the 70-21 live the

6903.679 --> 6906.4
cutting edge

6908.88 --> 6911.1990000000005
nope

6916.32 --> 6922.08
nothing

6919.119 --> 6924.239
i'm sorry guys i'm not seeing any

6922.08 --> 6927.28
any sort of flat earth link thing

6924.239 --> 6930.4
wikipedia i've i've never seen one

6927.28 --> 6931.44
before and i go on the internet every

6930.4 --> 6932.5599999999995
day

6931.44 --> 6936.48
for

6932.56 --> 6938.8
well a very long time but in flat earth

6936.48 --> 6941.759999999999
i was there when they were rolling out

6938.8 --> 6944.2390000000005
that weird thing about

6941.76 --> 6946.639
flat earth censorship

6944.239 --> 6948.959999999999
it's it's one of the very very few

6946.639 --> 6951.119
videos that i actually uploaded on my

6948.96 --> 6952.639
channel because i extremely rarely do

6951.119 --> 6954.96
that

6952.639 --> 6956.8
that was like years ago i was like two

6954.96 --> 6958.4
three years ago

6956.8 --> 6962.2390000000005
i've never

6958.4 --> 6964.08
seen one of those tags ever

6962.239 --> 6967.839999999999
on your phone well that makes sense then

6964.08 --> 6967.84
because i've never seen one ever

6968.4 --> 6973.119
i'm not using vpn no no

6970.88 --> 6974.4800000000005
i'm actually using firefox browser so

6973.119 --> 6976.96
it's not that

6974.48 --> 6979.678999999999
appeal it must be because of mobile then

6976.96 --> 6982.32
it's a mobile only thing because i've

6979.679 --> 6983.599
never seen one of those i only ever get

6982.32 --> 6986.4
to see

6983.599 --> 6988.56
medical misinformation tags

6986.4 --> 6990.799999999999
i do see those

6988.56 --> 6992.96
i've seen them on my own channel i've

6990.8 --> 6996.96
seen them on other channels every time

6992.96 --> 6999.84
mr chestwick uploads another jb video he

6996.96 --> 6999.84
gets one of those

7000.239 --> 7004.799999999999
so the medicum is information text you

7002.88 --> 7007.28
do get them on

7004.8 --> 7010.639
a pc

7007.28 --> 7013.36
but those pop-ups for the uh

7010.639 --> 7013.36
whatever that is

7013.52 --> 7017.84
so using windows 10 it's there

7019.28 --> 7024.08
you shouldn't have done that

7021.679 --> 7026.4
you shouldn't have done that

7024.08 --> 7030.239
i'm sorry i'm sorry for laughing at your

7026.4 --> 7034.96
suffering there i'm just

7030.239 --> 7034.959999999999
i'm just so happy i got windows 7

7035.199 --> 7039.08
because i don't have it

7046.96 --> 7052.159
ghostery or any ad blocks will stop them

7049.599 --> 7053.4400000000005
tags i'm i'm not using those i don't use

7052.159 --> 7056.239
ad block

7053.44 --> 7060.32
or that other thing ghost 3 whatever i

7056.239 --> 7062.5599999999995
don't use it and i've never seen one

7060.32 --> 7064.48
so i guess you just gotta stick to

7062.56 --> 7068.159000000001
windows seven

7064.48 --> 7068.159
and then you don't have those problems

7068.239 --> 7071.5599999999995
very typical

7074.48 --> 7079.678999999999
it's fine

7076.4 --> 7083.04
i couldn't it is an it is a nag i'm just

7079.679 --> 7084.08
saying that i'm not getting those

7083.04 --> 7086.4
so i'm

7084.08 --> 7088.719
but i but apparently you guys say that i

7086.4 --> 7091.119
do get those tags well

7088.719 --> 7093.28
not surprising of course i mean

7091.119 --> 7095.44
every show i do

7093.28 --> 7097.119
is called flat earth early bird right in

7095.44 --> 7098.32
the title so

7097.119 --> 7101.839999999999
yeah

7098.32 --> 7101.84
that's what you get

7114.719 --> 7123.08
you've emailed me a screenshot okay

7118.88 --> 7123.08
thanks check it out

7134.4 --> 7137.04
oh wow

7138.239 --> 7141.119
you're right

7139.92 --> 7144.36
wow

7141.119 --> 7146.639
the flat earth mortar is archaic and

7144.36 --> 7148.88
scientifically disprove that

7146.639 --> 7148.88
no

7150.56 --> 7154.400000000001
has a plane or a disk no

7154.639 --> 7158.639
wow that is just a straight out in your

7156.719 --> 7161.599
face lie though

7158.639 --> 7164.400000000001
also yeah i don't claim that model i

7161.599 --> 7166.8
don't claim the model

7164.4 --> 7169.759999999999
so that's already a strong man

7166.8 --> 7171.28
but okay thanks i guess

7169.76 --> 7174.280000000001
i get these

7171.28 --> 7174.28
goodies

7202.08 --> 7207.88
you had to run it

7204.88 --> 7207.88
oh

7216.0 --> 7219.599
okay that sucks and wheel

7224.56 --> 7229.92
i mean can't you just branch it off

7227.44 --> 7232.96
well maybe that's too difficult i mean

7229.92 --> 7237.1990000000005
if i you had to have a computer for with

7232.96 --> 7239.199
a special program for your profession

7237.199 --> 7241.04
i'd like almost just get another

7239.199 --> 7242.799999999999
computer then

7241.04 --> 7245.679
you just install

7242.8 --> 7248.96
just that [ __ ] little program on that

7245.679 --> 7250.719
and nothing else keep it super bare bone

7248.96 --> 7252.56
minimum for that

7250.719 --> 7253.76
and just connect them

7252.56 --> 7255.360000000001
like through

7253.76 --> 7256.96
through a

7255.36 --> 7258.719
through a hub

7256.96 --> 7261.44
internet connect and then you can just

7258.719 --> 7263.76
have one computer that runs on windows 7

7261.44 --> 7266.638999999999
works perfectly and then you have the

7263.76 --> 7268.4800000000005
professional computer with the shitty

7266.639 --> 7272.400000000001
updated software because otherwise you

7268.48 --> 7274.4
can't run your one program on it

7272.4 --> 7276.0
that's how i would do it

7274.4 --> 7277.5199999999995
but yes a

7276.0 --> 7282.199
bit of a

7277.52 --> 7282.1990000000005
hindsight unfortunately for you

7287.679 --> 7292.4400000000005
do people know what archaic means

7307.44 --> 7311.119
nathan's channel it shows the same

7308.88 --> 7314.32
wikipedia attack yeah because he

7311.119 --> 7316.4
probably updated it with the stupid

7314.32 --> 7317.5199999999995
little update

7316.4 --> 7320.5599999999995
yeah

7317.52 --> 7322.8
i mean there's on windows 7 2 has just

7320.56 --> 7325.76
like invasion wear

7322.8 --> 7328.4800000000005
you just have to know what it is that it

7325.76 --> 7330.88
wants you to install

7328.48 --> 7332.159
yeah if you just say oh no everything it

7330.88 --> 7334.4800000000005
says i'm just going to install

7332.159 --> 7337.36
everything that windows up there says

7334.48 --> 7341.28
yes oh brilliant

7337.36 --> 7344.799999999999
no no don't do that you have to know

7341.28 --> 7348.08
what it's trying to do you have to know

7344.8 --> 7350.400000000001
if you don't you click no

7348.08 --> 7352.32
you have to know

7350.4 --> 7355.119
have to figure it out you look it up

7352.32 --> 7357.92
super annoying look it up google it

7355.119 --> 7360.799999999999
google the code see what that is see why

7357.92 --> 7362.32
it's supposedly needed see if you need

7360.8 --> 7365.04
that

7362.32 --> 7368.239
if you don't if it's like oh this

7365.04 --> 7371.119
software is dubious ads on

7368.239 --> 7373.678999999999
like an open door for other [ __ ]

7371.119 --> 7376.48
and you don't use it if you don't need

7373.679 --> 7379.36
it you don't use it you don't need an a

7376.48 --> 7382.0
windows update then you don't install

7379.36 --> 7384.239
said windows update

7382.0 --> 7387.199
yeah windows 10 forces you yeah that's

7384.239 --> 7387.199
why it sucks

7392.0 --> 7397.76
yeah many great add-ons for firefox i

7394.0 --> 7399.92
know firefox is officially not even it's

7397.76 --> 7403.4400000000005
it's dead it's officially not even

7399.92 --> 7405.84
usable it's still usable though i'm

7403.44 --> 7407.759999999999
still using it even though there was a

7405.84 --> 7408.96
giant announcement how it wouldn't run

7407.76 --> 7411.360000000001
anymore

7408.96 --> 7413.28
last year

7411.36 --> 7418.679
oh no

7413.28 --> 7418.679
still using it it works great

7427.92 --> 7432.56
yeah that's right m appeal he does it's

7429.92 --> 7432.56
embarrassing

7432.719 --> 7437.36
if he wants to do that then go [ __ ]

7435.04 --> 7439.199
do it if people will throw money at you

7437.36 --> 7441.28
so that you could upgrade your stupid

7439.199 --> 7442.96
little computer so you can pay stupid

7441.28 --> 7444.88
games that are [ __ ] boring and a

7442.96 --> 7447.44
waste of time

7444.88 --> 7447.4400000000005
go ahead

7448.159 --> 7453.239
it's his freaking life not mine

7496.159 --> 7500.4

7540.239 --> 7544.638999999999
anyway thank you godzilla

7542.159 --> 7547.36
for coming by and super and the paypal

7544.639 --> 7549.599
donation that was great

7547.36 --> 7552.48
i'll see you guys yeah see you tomorrow

7549.599 --> 7554.639
then take it

7552.48 --> 7555.678999999999
oh wow i've already gone past two hours

7554.639 --> 7558.0
damn

7555.679 --> 7561.0
time has flown

7558.0 --> 7561.0
oh

7562.96 --> 7567.04
yeah i still wanted to kind of like make

7564.719 --> 7569.199
mention of

7567.04 --> 7570.48
finishing up the

7569.199 --> 7573.759999999999
gundam

7570.48 --> 7573.759999999999
unicorn series

7573.84 --> 7578.2390000000005
it was pretty spectacular but then

7576.239 --> 7579.919999999999
afterward i also realized it kind of

7578.239 --> 7581.5199999999995
made me sick

7579.92 --> 7583.92
this is really weird because it's what

7581.52 --> 7586.88
the robot tech series did too

7583.92 --> 7588.4800000000005
because it's kind of military propaganda

7586.88 --> 7592.400000000001
in a way

7588.48 --> 7595.199
they are literally glorifying death

7592.4 --> 7597.28
in in and they really push it

7595.199 --> 7599.199
and that is

7597.28 --> 7601.599
it is what it is

7599.199 --> 7602.799999999999
but if you let if you get caught up into

7601.599 --> 7604.719
it too much

7602.8 --> 7608.56
because you're an empath

7604.719 --> 7610.4
it can actually make you literally sick

7608.56 --> 7612.4800000000005
i almost got nightmares from it

7610.4 --> 7613.92
yesterday because i've literally been

7612.48 --> 7615.44
watching it too much i went through the

7613.92 --> 7618.719
whole series in

7615.44 --> 7621.28
in like a few days

7618.719 --> 7624.56
and it's really beautiful and it's like

7621.28 --> 7626.8
wow this is what you want to see man

7624.56 --> 7628.56
but then eventually it'll start to shine

7626.8 --> 7630.320000000001
through that

7628.56 --> 7634.320000000001
that it isn't

7630.32 --> 7637.5199999999995
perfectly cohesive it is just almost

7634.32 --> 7641.679
almost perfect but it in the end it just

7637.52 --> 7644.2390000000005
gets like really rushed and dramatic

7641.679 --> 7646.2390000000005
and then you're like what the [ __ ] is

7644.239 --> 7648.879999999999
going on here you're literally like oh

7646.239 --> 7651.28
this is so super cool i have no [ __ ]

7648.88 --> 7652.96
clue what's happening

7651.28 --> 7654.32
that's gonna happen in the end with the

7652.96 --> 7655.119
series

7654.32 --> 7656.5599999999995
right

7655.119 --> 7657.679
so i just wanted to give you a fair

7656.56 --> 7658.88
warning

7657.679 --> 7661.76
it's not

7658.88 --> 7665.52
gay in a sense it has no homosexuality

7661.76 --> 7667.76
in it at all which i really really

7665.52 --> 7670.8
[ __ ] appreciate there might be

7667.76 --> 7673.280000000001
some secret homosexuality in there but

7670.8 --> 7675.679
they never just say it they never just

7673.28 --> 7676.48
have guys kiss or anything there might

7675.679 --> 7677.4400000000005
have been

7676.48 --> 7680.0
like

7677.44 --> 7682.239
it's like military romance it's what

7680.0 --> 7686.0
that is it's how it's built it's like a

7682.239 --> 7688.718999999999
little roman novel for military

7686.0 --> 7690.48
inspired people

7688.719 --> 7692.4
and then brought into that sci-fi

7690.48 --> 7694.5599999999995
universe

7692.4 --> 7696.159
so yeah when i said yesterday it's not

7694.56 --> 7698.88
gay

7696.159 --> 7700.879999999999
it's not perfectly safe either it's

7698.88 --> 7704.079
definitely not something you should like

7700.88 --> 7706.56
show to small children i think

7704.079 --> 7709.28
i mean you probably could but they might

7706.56 --> 7713.360000000001
get nightmares from it

7709.28 --> 7715.44
i got nightmares from watching robotech

7713.36 --> 7716.639
as a kid because i watched it when i was

7715.44 --> 7720.638999999999
like eight

7716.639 --> 7725.04
and it gave me nightmares but also like

7720.639 --> 7727.1990000000005
it really did inspire me a lot though

7725.04 --> 7728.719
on top of the nightmares because because

7727.199 --> 7731.199
of what it does because it's just saying

7728.719 --> 7732.96
like the ultimate destiny and you're

7731.199 --> 7736.0
literally gonna die for like the

7732.96 --> 7736.0
ultimate cause and

7736.079 --> 7740.799999999999
and they glorify that

7737.84 --> 7742.96
and they do that in this series too

7740.8 --> 7745.360000000001
so it's not

7742.96 --> 7747.679
it has like military gravel i just

7745.36 --> 7750.5599999999995
wanted to give a fair warning

7747.679 --> 7750.56
it's not perfect

7751.199 --> 7757.44
it will it might leave you second

7754.639 --> 7761.36

7757.44 --> 7763.04
