Today's Show is just number 1430

126.42 --> 130.08
redo because yesterday was not much of a

129.06 --> 132.18
show

130.08 --> 133.5
but anyway yeah the good weather has

132.18 --> 136.58
returned

133.5 --> 136.58
right on cue

138.78 --> 144.66
so yeah that

141.62 --> 145.8
there do seem to be some Trails being

144.66 --> 149.22
left

145.8 --> 150.739
but I'm just really happy that the

149.22 --> 153.66
clouds are

150.739 --> 156.12
well thin enough to let some of that

153.66 --> 159.66
glorious Sun through

156.12 --> 162.37900000000002
haha just like in the side picture

159.66 --> 162.379
see that

167.64 --> 172.61999999999998
just like in the CGI background

174.26 --> 179.099
I mean that CGI is pretty damn well

177.72 --> 182.35999999999999
developed

179.099 --> 182.35999999999999
I really like it

183.3 --> 188.519
but yeah

185.64 --> 191.27999999999997
with the fluffy clouds as well fluffy

188.519 --> 194.64000000000001
clouds to Haze

191.28 --> 197.9
there's barely any wind

194.64 --> 197.89999999999998
sounds coming through

199.68 --> 206.18
it's pretty nice

201.78 --> 206.18
for now let's hope it stays that way

206.519 --> 211.96
hmm

208.76 --> 211.95999999999998
[Music]

213.36 --> 219.26000000000002
hello

214.7 --> 219.26
4kc first in chat good to see you

220.379 --> 226.62
it is Wednesday the 23rd of November

223.62 --> 226.62
2022

230.48 --> 236.76
yeah so yesterday

233.76 --> 239.099
it's a very short show

236.76 --> 242.29899999999998
because I was just

239.099 --> 242.29899999999998
kind of unstable

243.12 --> 248.64000000000001
not because of like alcohol or anything

245.459 --> 250.68
it's probably because of like sugar

248.64 --> 253.26
because they Chow Down a whole bunch of

250.68 --> 255.18
stuff the night before

253.26 --> 257.459
when especially during the gym Bob

255.18 --> 259.56
stream which I was was a big part of I

257.459 --> 261.84000000000003
hope you guys have seen that

259.56 --> 264.5
because it was very interesting and

261.84 --> 264.5
entertaining

266.82 --> 271.74
I triggered a Gematria person live on

269.88 --> 274.86
air a lot

271.74 --> 277.8
I mean a lot

274.86 --> 279.3
I was like shocked that it was so

277.8 --> 282.3
triggered

279.3 --> 282.3
uh

283.62 --> 288.84000000000003
but uh yeah

286.199 --> 291.259
sugar crash that can so yeah it did suck

288.84 --> 291.25899999999996
a lot

292.08 --> 297.02
it's also because well I'm not used to

294.479 --> 299.88
it and I basically

297.02 --> 302.4
underestimated how much of an impact it

299.88 --> 304.68
would make and on top of that I

302.4 --> 307.62
basically skipped my

304.68 --> 309.66
my dinner because of it as well because

307.62 --> 311.34000000000003
it was during the Jim Bob stream and I

309.66 --> 313.91900000000004
realized like I kind of need to get

311.34 --> 316.32
dinner but the stream was really good so

313.919 --> 319.19899999999996
I then just started to

316.32 --> 321.0
do that and yeah it went all wrong

319.199 --> 324.0
afterwards

321.0 --> 325.68
although yeah I mean in the night it

324.0 --> 329.82
didn't seem that bad but in the morning

325.68 --> 332.94
it was like oh this is not good

329.82 --> 335.12
right so yeah probably should crash it

332.94 --> 335.12
sucks

339.78 --> 343.34999999999997
anyway

340.919 --> 345.19899999999996
uh

343.35 --> 348.62
[Music]

345.199 --> 348.62
where's everybody

352.32 --> 354.919
foreign

364.22 --> 367.46000000000004
let's see

367.8 --> 373.44
yeah yes yeah by the way to recover from

370.38 --> 378.74
that I basically took like well and the

373.44 --> 378.74
show immediately Dove under a hot shower

378.86 --> 382.86
[Music]

379.979 --> 385.25899999999996
it's basically to heat up because part

382.86 --> 388.199
of what that issue seemed to be that

385.259 --> 390.47900000000004
it's just like my blood just retracted

388.199 --> 393.18
so just getting directly under a hot

390.479 --> 397.139
shower immediately makes the blood go

393.18 --> 398.34000000000003
everywhere and that really does help it

397.139 --> 400.5
really does

398.34 --> 402.96
or it did for me at least

400.5 --> 404.88
but uh

402.96 --> 407.65999999999997
hey Mike zunich

404.88 --> 407.65999999999997
let's see you

408.08 --> 413.15999999999997
yeah after that

410.759 --> 417.56
went back in bed

413.16 --> 417.56
and also yeah call My Healer

417.78 --> 422.58
basically informed him that I was

419.639 --> 426.139
reading Ruto Steiner's book a bit but

422.58 --> 426.139
yeah also to have him check me

427.639 --> 433.919
and yeah so I made it pretty much a full

430.86 --> 437.699
recovery but I did sleep like four hours

433.919 --> 440.75899999999996
I think no wait three hours

437.699 --> 445.039
I also missed the fed the live show but

440.759 --> 445.039
got it on there during the after show

446.16 --> 449.16
uh

452.22 --> 466.04900000000004
let's see what else is out there

456.35 --> 466.04900000000004
[Music]

473.88 --> 481.44
yeah kiwi was live

477.18 --> 484.22
sort of a nunty clip show was funny

481.44 --> 484.21999999999997
uh

485.16 --> 491.16
it was a Premiere by the way

487.56 --> 494.039
yeah it was basically an empty clip so

491.16 --> 497.24
Jim Bob went live again I also I almost

494.039 --> 497.24
joined in again

497.819 --> 502.74
but yeah I don't want to appear to a big

500.699 --> 505.56
crowd

502.74 --> 507.419
so as soon as I tried like he let three

505.56 --> 509.419
other people on and it was like okay

507.419 --> 514.5799999999999
well

509.419 --> 514.5799999999999
no so I stuck to Jab

518.58 --> 523.9190000000001
right also re-watched the uh

521.58 --> 528.24
second Top Gun movie

523.919 --> 529.98
from a proper proper riff not a cam

528.24 --> 532.44
video

529.98 --> 535.4590000000001
and yeah I mean it's a very enjoyable

532.44 --> 535.4590000000001
interesting film

536.459 --> 540.2399999999999
with just

538.019 --> 543.839
with a lot of effort

540.24 --> 547.62
to put character into it also I think

543.839 --> 552.6600000000001
there probably is some CGI in there and

547.62 --> 555.36
well it was well done it was well hidden

552.66 --> 558.36
so I think that this movie had been like

555.36 --> 561.6800000000001
full of CGI but it was really

558.36 --> 561.6800000000001
well hidden

562.08 --> 568.9200000000001
they they did like blurred CGI things

566.58 --> 571.38
on purpose like a Camera blur thing

568.92 --> 574.38
which is like perfect that that is like

571.38 --> 579.12
the way to hide it to basically hide CGI

574.38 --> 582.779
in plain sight by allowing typical eye

579.12 --> 586.08
effects on it that make it less crisps

582.779 --> 587.88
but make it more real and and yeah full

586.08 --> 591.4200000000001
of it

587.88 --> 593.58
I really like the movie anyway

591.42 --> 597.0889999999999
watch that

593.58 --> 597.089
[Music]

598.56 --> 605.03
hey LSG let's see you

601.56 --> 606.5999999999999
I really want to see that what

605.03 --> 608.459
[Music]

606.6 --> 610.98
Top Gun 2

608.459 --> 612.959
yeah it's pretty good

610.98 --> 615.6
I mean it is

612.959 --> 617.64
it is a Nostalgia piece too but it is

615.6 --> 620.58
like really

617.64 --> 623.54
they basically built a legend out of it

620.58 --> 623.5400000000001
and it is a

624.0 --> 627.959
yeah

625.74 --> 630.0
I don't know

627.959 --> 632.2199999999999
if you like the first Top Gun you're

630.0 --> 635.82
definitely definitely gonna like the

632.22 --> 639.48
second one also because they basically

635.82 --> 643.32
kept to like the the music score so it

639.48 --> 646.64
is also like kind of the old music

643.32 --> 646.6400000000001
style and all that

648.54 --> 653.04
it's funny because in a way that the

650.339 --> 655.6800000000001
main character Tom Cruise they kind of

653.04 --> 657.42
like put him into a time lock and it's

655.68 --> 660.26
also like a curse

657.42 --> 664.3199999999999
like he's like this cursed

660.26 --> 667.3199999999999
brilliant pilot that's kind of stuck to

664.32 --> 670.32
to events from the first top card it's

667.32 --> 672.36
it's all kind of straightforward not

670.32 --> 676.0790000000001
even that unexpected but it's just well

672.36 --> 678.24
executed I like I really like the movie

676.079 --> 680.16
I knew that the first time I saw it but

678.24 --> 683.52
now seeing it properly

680.16 --> 689.7289999999999
yeah it's good

683.52 --> 689.7289999999999
[Music]

697.279 --> 701.519
foreign

699.019 --> 703.68
so yeah what have you guys been up to I

701.519 --> 707.66
mean yesterday no early bird show I hope

703.68 --> 707.66
it wasn't too much of a hole in your day

709.94 --> 713.149
[Music]

713.48 --> 719.1
although you probably could have just

716.16 --> 721.74
like watched Jim Bob

719.1 --> 724.03
because that was like I was on there for

721.74 --> 727.26
like two hours so

724.03 --> 727.26
[Music]

731.399 --> 733.88
together

736.32 --> 739.32
foreign

764.82 --> 770.0
work

767.279 --> 770.0
all right

772.86 --> 777.42
I feel restless and all that

775.38 --> 778.62
that kind of happened during like winter

777.42 --> 780.5999999999999
if it's

778.62 --> 783.26
freezing

780.6 --> 783.26
typically

790.74 --> 796.38
all right so yeah I'm really gonna try

793.139 --> 799.6800000000001
to take it easy on you guys

796.38 --> 801.899
and it's also stood out to me like I've

799.68 --> 804.3599999999999
been getting a little bit more Restless

801.899 --> 808.62
over like the last few weeks gradually

804.36 --> 813.72
growing up myself and I've been pretty

808.62 --> 815.76
strict or harsh like on you guys right

813.72 --> 818.399
not like the trolls I mean yeah when the

815.76 --> 820.279
trolls come by you know what happens

818.399 --> 823.519
but

820.279 --> 826.38
I hope that that doesn't like that

823.519 --> 828.6
savageness doesn't like rub off on you

826.38 --> 829.86
or anything in a bad way it's not

828.6 --> 832.44
supposed to

829.86 --> 834.6
it's just for the trolls

832.44 --> 837.0600000000001
but uh yeah I've been going pretty

834.6 --> 839.22
strict on you guys and I just I feel

837.06 --> 842.2199999999999
like maybe I should like try to take it

839.22 --> 844.74
a bit more easy I mean yeah I get it

842.22 --> 847.639
annoys me sometimes that the chat

844.74 --> 847.639
doesn't flow but

848.22 --> 854.82
the issue really is is that

852.06 --> 857.579
in a way because of I guess the high

854.82 --> 859.74
tension in such moments that I don't

857.579 --> 861.66
really know what to do with it and maybe

859.74 --> 864.0790000000001
that is the problem that I should be

861.66 --> 864.079
tackling

866.279 --> 869.36
well anyway

871.019 --> 878.339
almost the sun goes down right oh oh

874.68 --> 880.8
yeah it was Oh you mean you're like

878.339 --> 883.2600000000001
not getting any daylight you're just

880.8 --> 885.899
like in a basement that sucks yeah

883.26 --> 888.36
that's not good

885.899 --> 891.8
don't you have like like any

888.36 --> 891.8000000000001
top windows or something

895.86 --> 899.1800000000001
in that Workshop

899.459 --> 902.0
hmm

903.66 --> 908.279
right so yeah you you go out and get

905.94 --> 910.3800000000001
some of that Sun Also look if that is

908.279 --> 912.06
like typically your work condition you

910.38 --> 916.199
might need to

912.06 --> 920.579
start supplementing with some D3 and K2

916.199 --> 924.74
or an alternative to that

920.579 --> 924.7399999999999
but yeah I mean

926.88 --> 932.579
if that is like a continual condition

929.579 --> 934.8
and you barely get any sunlight whether

932.579 --> 938.7299999999999
it is out there visible or covered by

934.8 --> 943.0799999999999
clouds you might want to do that

938.73 --> 943.08
[Music]

949.86 --> 954.86
anyway hello turret 306 good to see you

955.019 --> 958.019
foreign

960.42 --> 966.62
what do you mean you two you needed a

963.24 --> 966.62
day off from work as well

985.8 --> 988.8
foreign

995.76 --> 999.079
Restless right

1001.04 --> 1006.38
right so in the face of that and

1003.44 --> 1008.5400000000001
realizing that well you guys are also

1006.38 --> 1010.519
well now giving even signals about it I

1008.54 --> 1012.259
mean you're not complaining pants that

1010.519 --> 1014.0
as soon as something changes slightly

1012.259 --> 1015.98
you're going to be harping about it of

1014.0 --> 1019.579
course because you're not gammas

1015.98 --> 1022.6
but since you're like oh at least G is

1019.579 --> 1022.5999999999999
even saying that

1022.699 --> 1027.4389999999999
I'm gonna just take that as a signal

1024.86 --> 1028.4589999999998
like okay I maybe I need to take it a

1027.439 --> 1032.799
bit easy

1028.459 --> 1032.799
for a while for you guys

1040.459 --> 1045.939
all right anyway I've been watching a

1042.919 --> 1045.939
bit of oh Benjamin

1047.9 --> 1052.2800000000002
like he had a pretty epic stream I I'm

1050.36 --> 1054.74
not I'm partially through it with

1052.28 --> 1058.0
Christopher Gardner again

1054.74 --> 1058.0
is really awesome

1058.039 --> 1061.9
it was a great joy to watch those

1066.32 --> 1072.32
what

1068.96 --> 1075.22
I vacuumed the pool and checked my bees

1072.32 --> 1075.22
okay

1075.559 --> 1082.0
life's hard I hope your bees are doing

1077.66 --> 1082.0
all right iron 26 it's you

1088.94 --> 1091.539
right

1097.64 --> 1100.64

1104.51 --> 1108.6299999999999

1113.18 --> 1123.809
[Music]

1124.039 --> 1126.52
foreign

1146.02 --> 1150.52
four weeks wow

1151.28 --> 1157.34
I mean that's pretty amazing like

1154.58 --> 1162.6999999999998
fresh

1157.34 --> 1162.6999999999998
honey from your own bees that is

1163.16 --> 1167.9
I I can't imagine what that must be like

1165.5 --> 1170.44
I've never had that that was must be

1167.9 --> 1170.44
amazing

1171.02 --> 1177.22
like if you can just have it raw

1173.66 --> 1180.26
do you I hope you like use the uh

1177.22 --> 1183.679
centrifuge extraction method you don't

1180.26 --> 1188.0
like eat it

1183.679 --> 1190.8200000000002
I'm not sure maybe yeah

1188.0 --> 1192.62
but I've heard yeah you can get raw

1190.82 --> 1194.72
honey by like putting it into a

1192.62 --> 1198.9399999999998
centrifuge

1194.72 --> 1198.94
and then you don't have to like heat it

1198.98 --> 1204.799
can photons collide with each other no

1202.039 --> 1207.5
and photons are conceptual

1204.799 --> 1211.6
particles

1207.5 --> 1211.6
but yeah they aren't really

1214.12 --> 1219.3799999999999
besides like

1216.2 --> 1221.66
Collision would already like suggest

1219.38 --> 1224.8400000000001
travel and they don't

1221.66 --> 1227.78
they just manifest and it's like yeah a

1224.84 --> 1230.78
beam can just like Boop double manifest

1227.78 --> 1236.3799999999999
right through it each it's yeah another

1230.78 --> 1236.3799999999999
beam and there is no interference at all

1240.679 --> 1245.26
I mean the only interference that would

1242.96 --> 1245.26
come

1245.48 --> 1251.419
from light that might influence other

1249.02 --> 1254.179
light is when there is so much light

1251.419 --> 1257.24
that it literally like plasmifies the

1254.179 --> 1260.7800000000002
air like lightning and that might alter

1257.24 --> 1262.16
like the properties of the local Air

1260.78 --> 1264.62
there

1262.16 --> 1267.74
in order for a light to start like

1264.62 --> 1269.6
having a different type of refraction or

1267.74 --> 1271.64
something right

1269.6 --> 1275.1789999999999
but that's purely because of the energy

1271.64 --> 1280.3600000000001
absorption from satellite to the air

1275.179 --> 1280.3600000000001
that would cause that not light itself

1284.0 --> 1287.5
it's light take up space

1287.96 --> 1292.94
take note

1290.419 --> 1295.7800000000002
I mean it

1292.94 --> 1295.78
laughs

1295.94 --> 1301.7
I I guess yes but take up is like

1299.179 --> 1303.679
suggesting that it takes something away

1301.7 --> 1306.44
that's no longer there and that's not

1303.679 --> 1308.299
the case I mean it occupies it

1306.44 --> 1311.8600000000001
but

1308.299 --> 1311.86
it doesn't really take it up

1319.58 --> 1325.869
[Music]

1332.0 --> 1336.44
oh okay turret I I don't know I didn't I

1335.0 --> 1339.4
didn't I wasn't there during the live

1336.44 --> 1339.4
show I was sleeping

1340.28 --> 1344.78
I don't know what happened I was only

1342.14 --> 1347.98
there during the after show

1344.78 --> 1347.98
hey Wells rice

1356.48 --> 1360.98
yeah by the way Wells rice I keep

1358.88 --> 1363.2
calling you that that was like this

1360.98 --> 1364.76
gamma troll earlier that I banned who

1363.2 --> 1367.039
was whining that it is pronounced

1364.76 --> 1369.559
Therese is it

1367.039 --> 1372.22
you never actually told me

1369.559 --> 1372.22
this is

1372.38 --> 1378.5
I mean it's just that if a gamma says it

1375.44 --> 1380.9
then I have to not do it but yeah over

1378.5 --> 1382.94
time I mean I don't want to just keep

1380.9 --> 1386.919
pronouncing your name wrong so is it

1382.94 --> 1386.919
Wells Therese or is it Welsh rice

1386.96 --> 1389.799
you tell me

1410.059 --> 1414.8799999999999
pronounce is how you want oh okay

1415.4 --> 1418.48
so you don't care

1425.48 --> 1429.38
all right

1427.34 --> 1431.539
it's more like reason and Rise though

1429.38 --> 1433.8200000000002
well there you go okay well then I'll

1431.539 --> 1436.299
just call you Welsh Reese

1433.82 --> 1436.299
fine

1438.11 --> 1444.7389999999998
[Music]

1452.08 --> 1459.4399999999998
see it's not it's not a big deal

1455.559 --> 1461.8999999999999
it's just as if a gamma starts whining

1459.44 --> 1464.02
about it yeah well then I just won't do

1461.9 --> 1464.02
it

1465.98 --> 1468.98
anyway

1473.9 --> 1477.039
welcome to the Stream

1485.84 --> 1491.059
any more good technical questions at

1488.12 --> 1494.539
least G I kind of like that I I almost

1491.059 --> 1497.6
got through those questions too quickly

1494.539 --> 1501.52
when it felt like oh finally my my

1497.6 --> 1501.52
computer is actually activated

1507.86 --> 1513.62
I mean I do feel I have a pretty damn

1510.919 --> 1515.1200000000001
good understanding of physics

1513.62 --> 1518.1789999999999
and I know that's going to immediately

1515.12 --> 1519.86
bring out a whole bunch of gamma trolls

1518.179 --> 1522.76
but that's fine

1519.86 --> 1522.76
yeah yeah

1525.62 --> 1530.84
but I love

1527.62 --> 1534.1
explaining things physics things I

1530.84 --> 1534.1
really do love doing that

1536.41 --> 1545.72
[Music]

1543.159 --> 1548.6000000000001
also because I just kind of have

1545.72 --> 1551.5
confidence in my models of

1548.6 --> 1553.6399999999999
that kind of reach beyond the regular

1551.5 --> 1555.2
understanding of some of these things

1553.64 --> 1557.779
like light

1555.2 --> 1559.7
I have a whole

1557.779 --> 1563.2
flow charts

1559.7 --> 1563.2
of ideas about it

1567.62 --> 1571.059
photons can't enter

1571.58 --> 1575.5
this Electric electrical charge

1578.12 --> 1583.1
right

1580.4 --> 1587.26
nor Mass

1583.1 --> 1587.26
they're just well yeah

1598.4 --> 1602.799
electric charge or

1602.84 --> 1608.559
or momentum was it something like that

1605.36 --> 1608.559
anyway yeah

1610.34 --> 1616.6999999999998
but the thing is is that photons is is

1612.559 --> 1620.059
kind of like an an isolate idea

1616.7 --> 1623.6000000000001
it's a it's only a model

1620.059 --> 1627.1399999999999
right there is no Photon photon is like

1623.6 --> 1628.6999999999998
the attempt to like isolate

1627.14 --> 1632.48
light

1628.7 --> 1634.52
within like a minimum

1632.48 --> 1639.2
particle

1634.52 --> 1642.2
but kind of invoking the necessity for a

1639.2 --> 1644.1200000000001
journey in order to isolate it like it's

1642.2 --> 1646.5800000000002
it's kind of a cluster [ __ ] of

1644.12 --> 1650.08
consequences

1646.58 --> 1650.08
and it is unnecessary

1650.419 --> 1656.72
I mean I don't even think that yeah

1653.659 --> 1659.179
that it really is I think

1656.72 --> 1661.039
there is a minimum size oh based on the

1659.179 --> 1664.8200000000002
interaction with the photoelectric

1661.039 --> 1668.539
plates yeah but

1664.82 --> 1672.559
what if you just take less than a

1668.539 --> 1675.3799999999999
photon's worth of energy in light

1672.559 --> 1677.779
and then combine two of those on the

1675.38 --> 1681.38
same electric plate in the exact same

1677.779 --> 1684.76
spot on unlike the micrometer

1681.38 --> 1684.7600000000002
right nanometer

1684.86 --> 1692.12
will it still be just a dud or will the

1689.36 --> 1695.6789999999999
combined energy of like two half of

1692.12 --> 1697.8799999999999
photons worth of energy be

1695.679 --> 1700.4
triggering the photoelectric effect

1697.88 --> 1703.64
because if that is the case

1700.4 --> 1705.6200000000001
then the Assumption of a photon being a

1703.64 --> 1708.14
minimum particle like thing is

1705.62 --> 1712.779
completely wrong

1708.14 --> 1712.779
and there is no minimum size

1714.08 --> 1719.299
it's just a minimum size of minimum

1717.32 --> 1721.0
amount of energy

1719.299 --> 1726.08
for the

1721.0 --> 1728.299
photonic charge to in order to trigger a

1726.08 --> 1731.1789999999999
physical response in order to for the

1728.299 --> 1732.86
light to actually interact and Trigger

1731.179 --> 1735.5
that response

1732.86 --> 1737.4189999999999
right but that doesn't mean that if it

1735.5 --> 1739.22
is not enough to trigger the response

1737.419 --> 1741.26
that it doesn't exist

1739.22 --> 1745.34
it's just not enough

1741.26 --> 1747.08
so that was like a yeah conception

1745.34 --> 1749.6
postulate

1747.08 --> 1752.539
that I've brought forward like years ago

1749.6 --> 1754.6589999999999
now what is it three years ago discussed

1752.539 --> 1754.6589999999999
it

1754.7 --> 1759.2
quite elaborately with uh John refracted

1758.059 --> 1761.72
curvature

1759.2 --> 1764.72
who's who almost got to the point of

1761.72 --> 1767.299
actually trying to test my setup but

1764.72 --> 1769.1000000000001
then yeah it didn't work out which is

1767.299 --> 1772.46
quite a bummer

1769.1 --> 1774.62
right so

1772.46 --> 1776.16
how do massless particles Collide they

1774.62 --> 1779.6789999999999
don't

1776.16 --> 1779.679
[Music]

1783.559 --> 1788.48
doesn't light interact in the form of

1785.72 --> 1789.919
interference patterns

1788.48 --> 1791.84
no

1789.919 --> 1795.26
not really

1791.84 --> 1800.5
that is simply the form in which it

1795.26 --> 1802.76
manifests through the beams it diffracts

1800.5 --> 1805.34
interference pattern is because of the

1802.76 --> 1809.6
diffraction Cascade

1805.34 --> 1811.9399999999998
that is also mistakingly assumed to be

1809.6 --> 1814.399
the reason why light would have to be a

1811.94 --> 1817.1000000000001
wave which is a complete cluster screw

1814.399 --> 1820.1589999999999
of misassumptions

1817.1 --> 1824.059
and yeah I think that QE and Nathan is

1820.159 --> 1826.5800000000002
hammered that in for quite a while now

1824.059 --> 1828.5
right so I'm not gonna go there

1826.58 --> 1831.5
what's the diffraction Cascade

1828.5 --> 1834.52
diffraction Cascade is it unique

1831.5 --> 1838.34
property of light manifest

1834.52 --> 1842.12
that if it moves past

1838.34 --> 1844.6399999999999
a surface which is diffraction it Alters

1842.12 --> 1847.9399999999998
but if you then take

1844.64 --> 1851.6000000000001
two slits

1847.94 --> 1854.96
then something bizarre happens and it

1851.6 --> 1857.899
starts to not just split up in two or

1854.96 --> 1860.539
three but in a lot and that is unique

1857.899 --> 1862.58
with light other material and electrons

1860.539 --> 1866.12
and all that they don't do that

1862.58 --> 1868.46
they split up in three bands Max light

1866.12 --> 1872.1789999999999
is the only thing that actually cast

1868.46 --> 1874.159
Kates Beyond three bands something that

1872.179 --> 1875.24
for some reason QE never likes to

1874.159 --> 1879.5
address

1875.24 --> 1882.2
even though he basically would admit it

1879.5 --> 1887.14
but he doesn't see it as like a valid

1882.2 --> 1887.14
ground for an argument so yeah whatever

1888.08 --> 1893.3799999999999
I call it the diffraction Cascade it is

1891.02 --> 1896.72
basically diffraction but I am

1893.38 --> 1899.1200000000001
emphasizing that it is

1896.72 --> 1901.7
a Cascade

1899.12 --> 1903.559
because it's split up it splits up in

1901.7 --> 1905.6000000000001
more than three bands which is unique

1903.559 --> 1907.84
with light it doesn't happen with other

1905.6 --> 1907.84
things

1907.94 --> 1910.1200000000001

1941.919 --> 1947.96
fossils interesting yeah laser

1945.679 --> 1950.72
Laser Printers

1947.96 --> 1954.2
light Glazer 3D model printers in resin

1950.72 --> 1957.32
yeah yeah what it does is basically just

1954.2 --> 1959.1200000000001
have beams and then combined they'll

1957.32 --> 1961.1
have enough strength to basically

1959.12 --> 1964.279
transform the matter where they

1961.1 --> 1966.1399999999999
basically cross over but separately they

1964.279 --> 1969.62
don't so one beam could just go through

1966.14 --> 1972.7990000000002
it nothing happens two beams and exactly

1969.62 --> 1975.82
where they meet the light combined will

1972.799 --> 1978.5
be have sufficient energy to start

1975.82 --> 1980.24
transforming the material that's how

1978.5 --> 1982.94
they do it I think

1980.24 --> 1985.82
it's really smart by the way that's

1982.94 --> 1989.14
brilliant brilliant

1985.82 --> 1989.1399999999999
whoever invented that

1989.75 --> 1999.14

2011.279 --> 2019.5
I mean that's literally laser Precision

2015.12 --> 2019.5
printing ability you see

2019.539 --> 2026.679
in lasers can be extraordinarily precise

2023.74 --> 2028.419
compared to every other form of

2026.679 --> 2031.419
well

2028.419 --> 2033.159
measuring or aiming tool that's why they

2031.419 --> 2036.7
use lasers for aiding in the military

2033.159 --> 2039.46
you know it's not without reason

2036.7 --> 2040.96
because they are you can be extremely

2039.46 --> 2043.24
accurate with it

2040.96 --> 2046.3600000000001
right

2043.24 --> 2050.76
it's just lasers are always a ploy

2046.36 --> 2050.7599999999998
employed for accuracy anyway

2070.419 --> 2074.7599999999998
you can bend the path

2075.76 --> 2079.9190000000003
what do you mean Iron 26

2082.899 --> 2088.48
I mean diffraction is the bending of the

2086.139 --> 2093.2400000000002
path naturally

2088.48 --> 2093.2400000000002

talking about the nature of light it

2110.98 --> 2114.96
seems and now lasers got brought up and

2115.42 --> 2122.079
laser 3D printers how that works

2119.32 --> 2124.8
it's a very smart design

2122.079 --> 2124.8
ah

2140.16 --> 2143.2799999999997
[Music]

2152.619 --> 2154.619
um

2158.079 --> 2163.5
right so any more questions or

2160.96 --> 2163.5
anything

2164.079 --> 2169.3590000000004
Nemo you got some questions I mean feel

2167.2 --> 2171.64
free to ask I mean it doesn't matter

2169.359 --> 2173.68
that you're like 12.

2171.64 --> 2177.5789999999997
when it concerns these questions okay

2173.68 --> 2179.5
when I was 12 you bet your ass I was

2177.579 --> 2181.0600000000004
nagging my older brother seven years

2179.5 --> 2184.18
older than me

2181.06 --> 2186.16
about these things I was like no explain

2184.18 --> 2188.68
it to me I mean I might not be able to

2186.16 --> 2191.7999999999997
like repeat it like a master

2188.68 --> 2193.72
but it'll help me a lot

2191.8 --> 2195.52
and it did

2193.72 --> 2198.22
back then

2195.52 --> 2201.339
and then it's like it gave me like my

2198.22 --> 2205.7799999999997
first blueprint of understanding

2201.339 --> 2208.24
still fueled by my youthful energy but

2205.78 --> 2210.0400000000004
not tamed with wisdom and kind of

2208.24 --> 2211.7999999999997
forgotted it again you know that's how

2210.04 --> 2213.7599999999998
it goes it's just you get something

2211.8 --> 2215.46
brilliant and then you kind of forget

2213.76 --> 2218.44
about it because you don't interact

2215.46 --> 2220.9
using that information all the time

2218.44 --> 2223.839
but then later when you bump into it

2220.9 --> 2227.5
again you certainly got the old tool

2223.839 --> 2229.7799999999997
back and you already realize that you

2227.5 --> 2233.14
know so many steps even though back then

2229.78 --> 2236.2200000000003
you didn't consciously grasp that about

2233.14 --> 2239.46
it right so it's very valuable to teach

2236.22 --> 2244.5989999999997
really complicated things or attempt to

2239.46 --> 2244.599
to interested youngsters

2246.099 --> 2251.46
is laser concentrated light

2251.859 --> 2258.5989999999997
the concentrated now that's the wrong

2254.02 --> 2262.359
phraseology it is light that is like

2258.599 --> 2264.339
homogenized in the sense that it is

2262.359 --> 2267.8199999999997
I don't know you exactly know how they

2264.339 --> 2269.74
do it I'm not a laser mechanic so but

2267.82 --> 2272.2000000000003
basically it comes down to that all the

2269.74 --> 2275.2599999999998
light that comes out of it is perfectly

2272.2 --> 2277.859
parallel without scattering it is the

2275.26 --> 2277.8590000000004
parallel

2278.26 --> 2283.5600000000004
making it parallel that really turns it

2280.72 --> 2283.56
into a laser

2286.18 --> 2290.52
and yeah it can be intensified

2296.73 --> 2300.659
[Music]

2300.66 --> 2306.54
coherent beam of no it's not a coherent

2303.579 --> 2306.54
beam of photons

2308.38 --> 2314.38
you don't need to you don't need to use

2311.98 --> 2317.38
that vernacular even if schools teach

2314.38 --> 2320.2200000000003
that because it's car [ __ ]

2317.38 --> 2324.119
there's no there's no point of even

2320.22 --> 2327.5789999999997
treating it like a particle

2324.119 --> 2331.38
Photon because the only thing that even

2327.579 --> 2335.28
plays into is like the unified

2331.38 --> 2338.1400000000003
atomatization of all matter and things

2335.28 --> 2340.5400000000004
so it's pointless

2338.14 --> 2343.67
it doesn't have any practical use to

2340.54 --> 2345.7
even regard light as photons

2343.67 --> 2348.7200000000003
[Music]

2345.7 --> 2348.72
and it's instant

2349.06 --> 2353.98
and we don't know how small the energy

2351.28 --> 2357.0
can even manifest

2353.98 --> 2357.0
can be tested

2357.22 --> 2360.22
foreign

2363.16 --> 2367.359
laser beams diverge over distance though

2365.5 --> 2369.76
don't yes

2367.359 --> 2373.24
I mean perfect parallelness is

2369.76 --> 2374.6800000000003
impossible and yeah light does interact

2373.24 --> 2378.64
with

2374.68 --> 2382.68
the air it goes through and eventually

2378.64 --> 2382.68
there will be refraction

2384.28 --> 2391.2400000000002
that maybe if you try if you shoot a

2387.4 --> 2395.02
laser through an absolute perfect vacuum

2391.24 --> 2397.9599999999996
like a tube vacuum then maybe there

2395.02 --> 2400.96
would be no scattering

2397.96 --> 2405.0
but yeah reality that's not what we use

2400.96 --> 2405.0
we lasers go through air

2406.079 --> 2414.3
and that will over distance make them

2409.599 --> 2414.3
kind of like start to scatter

2414.339 --> 2418.32
no longer be perfectly parallel

2430.18 --> 2432.4199999999996
what

2436.48 --> 2440.5
then what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2438.52 --> 2442.78
dude I have no idea what you're talking

2440.5 --> 2445.079
about mystical Rock on

2442.78 --> 2445.079
what

2449.859 --> 2456.88
I hope you do realize that I already

2452.14 --> 2459.8799999999997
shared that I'm not a laser mechanic

2456.88 --> 2459.88
okay

2463.3 --> 2471.48
I've never actually worked like with

2466.68 --> 2471.48
laboratory lasers or anything so

2471.52 --> 2481.56
it's a bunch of engineering talk

2494.02 --> 2497.22
hey steamy Traveler

2511.9 --> 2518.6800000000003
right but like even in the engineering I

2515.26 --> 2521.2000000000003
think that like the engineering of

2518.68 --> 2524.859
lasers and how they work and what you do

2521.2 --> 2527.68
with that it's been completely

2524.859 --> 2533.7
like draped

2527.68 --> 2533.7
with wave descriptions I mean seriously

2533.8 --> 2539.6800000000003
sine wave

2535.78 --> 2541.78
frequency those are all descriptions of

2539.68 --> 2546.48
wave properties

2541.78 --> 2550.96
and it's like the entire Light and Laser

2546.48 --> 2554.92
engineering sector has been riddled with

2550.96 --> 2557.38
those specific types of descriptions

2554.92 --> 2559.839
to kind of like fool the mechanics

2557.38 --> 2562.9
themselves into that light is a wave

2559.839 --> 2565.9
it's ridiculous I mean seriously this is

2562.9 --> 2568.92
like absurd that that works that way it

2565.9 --> 2568.92
is absurd

2570.4 --> 2583.56
but they do it

okay hello Reno

2640.359 --> 2648.72
Flat Earth gets dumbfounded really

2645.04 --> 2648.72
what about star trails

2663.339 --> 2668.2799999999997
okay Instagram

right

2674.26 --> 2679.1400000000003
like a gas electrifying lamp

2695.8 --> 2702.099
yeah Arena what is why what are you

2699.64 --> 2705.7599999999998
talking about dumbfounding

2702.099 --> 2707.51
star Trails oh

2728.319 --> 2736.2599999999998
oh my God I think we gotta

2732.3 --> 2736.26
derp gun level three

2739.66 --> 2745.0
what is it about star trails that is so

2743.2 --> 2746.4399999999996
convincing to Glovers

2745.0 --> 2749.56
oh

2746.44 --> 2751.7200000000003
oh it's a question okay well that's not

2749.56 --> 2755.5
that difficult what is so convincing

2751.72 --> 2758.9199999999996
well duh it's a Celestial apparent

2755.5 --> 2762.16
sphere and it rotates around us and if

2758.92 --> 2764.94
you move then the axis of rotation of

2762.16 --> 2768.8999999999996
the celestial parent sphere also rotates

2764.94 --> 2768.9
in correlation

2769.119 --> 2772.599
yeah

2770.5 --> 2776.5
and yeah so

2772.599 --> 2779.319
makes it kind of easier for the globe

2776.5 --> 2781.78
believer to imagine to presuppose that

2779.319 --> 2784.72
well if we're surrounded

2781.78 --> 2786.88
by a globe of stars and we move over the

2784.72 --> 2789.819
Earth and then the axis of that changes

2786.88 --> 2793.1800000000003
that it might actually be you walking

2789.819 --> 2796.9
over a ball in between it

2793.18 --> 2799.48
it is basically the start

2796.9 --> 2803.2000000000003
right besides the Horizon assumed to be

2799.48 --> 2805.2400000000002
geometric you need that on top

2803.2 --> 2807.52
well that's really where the

2805.24 --> 2810.2799999999997
presupposition of the Earth being a ball

2807.52 --> 2812.319
starts it starts with the Stars right

2810.28 --> 2815.5600000000004
the ball the stars are like little

2812.319 --> 2818.38
lights and they surround us in a ball

2815.56 --> 2821.14
and if we move over the Earth then it

2818.38 --> 2824.6800000000003
rotates so we must be walking on a ball

2821.14 --> 2827.14
underneath it then

2824.68 --> 2829.24
it is really like where the a lot of the

2827.14 --> 2832.0789999999997
suspense of disbelief

2829.24 --> 2832.0789999999997
starts

2834.04 --> 2839.8
it was very convincing argument on like

2837.28 --> 2841.96
an intuitive level for a very long time

2839.8 --> 2844.96
to me

2841.96 --> 2844.96

like I don't even want to address it

2870.22 --> 2875.859
that's literally just dementia

2873.46 --> 2878.68
people go by that like oh why do they

2875.859 --> 2880.41
rotate in One Direction but over there

any other direction

stars are not moving anywhere stars are

2966.52 --> 2970.359
at the edge of vision no matter where

2968.44 --> 2973.5
you are they're purely non-local

2970.359 --> 2973.5
holographic phenomena

2974.38 --> 2981.2200000000003

indication as to

the shape

2982.96 --> 2990.0
of our realm it's only when navigation

2986.2 --> 2992.9199999999996
was invented that can definitely

2990.0 --> 2995.619
conclude from how it's used that the

2992.92 --> 2997.9
Earth has to be flat

2995.619 --> 3000.9
but the Stars alone

2997.9 --> 3003.6600000000003

3000.9 --> 3006.26
not reveal anything it's a holographic

yeah Earth is not a disc with the

literally a broken device that he claims

3056.819 --> 3062.599
works out the way it's supposed to

ask him about that

what Dome

3091.559 --> 3095.579
how was Bob's gyro broken

3094.26 --> 3098.4
well

3095.579 --> 3102.8390000000004
it's a mechanical device

3098.4 --> 3106.319
they can have manufacturing weaknesses

3102.839 --> 3109.319
and yeah at some point it like it could

3106.319 --> 3110.52
have always been broken as he bought it

3109.319 --> 3112.619
or

3110.52 --> 3115.38
it broke

3112.619 --> 3117.599
during use at some point you don't know

3115.38 --> 3121.76
it's just it's a mechanical device it

3117.599 --> 3124.26
can break it can be off and if it's not

perfectly still

3124.26 --> 3130.2200000000003
not deviating then it's not functioning

as a gyroscope

3130.22 --> 3136.319
the whole point of a gyroscope is that

3132.839 --> 3139.319
they don't drift

3136.319 --> 3142.339
it drifts you're not using it properly

that's a straight-faced lie

3174.24 --> 3178.8799999999997
put your proof of this claim the proof

of this claim is that if a [ __ ]

no double Jello no it's not

spun up

3235.92 --> 3244.14
then they don't deviate

3239.819 --> 3249.0589999999997
they deviate then they're not stable

if a gyroscope cannot be stabilized it

3249.059 --> 3253.6800000000003
is broken

3250.619 --> 3257.96
or you're just too incompetent to know

3253.68 --> 3257.96
how to stabilize it either way

3263.61 --> 3268.1400000000003
[Music]

3265.8 --> 3270.7200000000003
get the [ __ ] out of here you goddamn

3268.14 --> 3273.98
[ __ ] piss off man

3270.72 --> 3273.98
piss off

3278.28 --> 3285.5400000000004
how does a ring laser gyroscope work

3281.099 --> 3287.1600000000003
different from a mechanical gyroscope

3285.54 --> 3291.839
it

3287.16 --> 3294.42
it basically makes slight spin or like

3291.839 --> 3297.68
yeah it's weird but it's different from

3294.42 --> 3297.6800000000003
a mechanical gyroscope

3299.819 --> 3305.22
I don't know exactly how they work

3302.76 --> 3307.92
I just know that there's no

3305.22 --> 3309.9599999999996
like uh

3307.92 --> 3312.96
that it's not about it well it's

3309.96 --> 3315.42
basically not a gyroscopic effect

3312.96 --> 3320.579
of material spinning

3315.42 --> 3323.4
but it is like yeah tracing the path of

3320.579 --> 3324.63
laser I I don't know exactly how it

3323.4 --> 3326.099
works it's it's weird

3324.63 --> 3330.319
[Music]

3326.099 --> 3330.319
it's just different from mechanical

3337.559 --> 3346.26
but yeah the point of any gyroscope as a

3342.599 --> 3348.48
functioning Industrial Tool applied to

3346.26 --> 3352.2000000000003
machinery

3348.48 --> 3354.0
for navigation purposes yes

3352.2 --> 3357.5989999999997
yeah

3354.0 --> 3362.0
if they deviate they're not functioning

3357.599 --> 3362.0
for what they're designed for

3367.92 --> 3371.46
is there a possibility that this and

3369.9 --> 3373.079
that and that yeah yeah sure there's a

3371.46 --> 3375.359
possibility there's also a possibility

3373.079 --> 3377.6600000000003
that if a gyroscope deviates that it's

3375.359 --> 3377.66
broken

3379.339 --> 3385.2
and I'm gonna take that likelihood since

3383.16 --> 3388.04
it's a much more straightforward and

3385.2 --> 3391.5
simple explanation

3388.04 --> 3394.97
and quite easy to prove

3391.5 --> 3402.559
compared to your suggestion there

3394.97 --> 3402.5589999999997
[Music]

3405.839 --> 3409.7999999999997
stay professional and speculative yeah

3407.88 --> 3412.26
but it's also pointless speculation

3409.8 --> 3416.119
because it's speculation about something

3412.26 --> 3416.119
that isn't really a mystery

3424.5 --> 3430.5
thank you

3426.3 --> 3433.44
now if you could find some mysterious

3430.5 --> 3436.46
natural deviation

3433.44 --> 3436.46
of light

3436.64 --> 3443.52
besides a broken gyroscope well I'd love

3440.579 --> 3444.78
to hear about it that would be very

3443.52 --> 3448.579
fascinating

3444.78 --> 3451.5
but if a gyroscope a man-made device

3448.579 --> 3454.1400000000003
intended not to deviate or it's broken

3451.5 --> 3459.5
if that is your sole source of this

3454.14 --> 3459.5
mysterious phenomenon of light rotation

3459.8 --> 3465.1800000000003
then yeah you're screwed

3463.14 --> 3468.9
because you're basing it off a man-made

3465.18 --> 3472.2599999999998
device that specifically is well broken

3468.9 --> 3475.319
according to its own specifications then

3472.26 --> 3479.78
that's really [ __ ]

3475.319 --> 3479.7799999999997
if that is your singular proof

you have any or if you just a bloated

my time Reno

3525.96 --> 3530.119
yeah he did get kicked that's right

3532.68 --> 3537.359
second account by the way yeah so this

3535.079 --> 3539.7000000000003
is a sock Guy this is a gamma [ __ ]

3537.359 --> 3542.04
that's now going to try to invade my

3542.04 --> 3547.98
to be heard with his [ __ ] [ __ ]

3567.54 --> 3571.859
yeah double Jello yeah that seems

3569.64 --> 3575.4
sensible but I don't think Bob really

3571.859 --> 3578.16
wants to because Bob wants to conjure

3575.4 --> 3580.38
some proof see

3578.16 --> 3582.7799999999997
for his ether

3580.38 --> 3584.6600000000003
so he's not going to correct it because

3582.78 --> 3587.84
he's a

you kidding me Garland he loved the

3646.859 --> 3651.42
why what

3648.839 --> 3653.64
dude the second he got those results

3651.42 --> 3655.46
even within the stupid Netflix

he immediately Drew in ether he got

exactly what he wanted Garland

he got exactly what he wanted because I

3667.98 --> 3673.14
don't think Bob actually gets a [ __ ]

about Flat Earth in the slightest it

3673.14 --> 3678.839
could be a ball it doesn't care really

3675.24 --> 3683.04
he cares about is that he can conjure

his stupid ether aberration [ __ ]

3683.04 --> 3687.7799999999997

3701.04 --> 3705.359
nobody came up with it

3703.319 --> 3707.7
yeah why do you think nobody came out

3705.359 --> 3710.7
with it because they knew it isn't

3707.7 --> 3712.4399999999996
scientific because they knew it's only a

3710.7 --> 3716.339
model yeah they were all fascinated by

3712.44 --> 3719.299
it but they knew it was only a model and

3716.339 --> 3719.299
it wasn't real

accepting that

[Music]

3736.859 --> 3740.48
hey Tony Whitcomb

3749.94 --> 3756.839
why did Bob try it again well

3753.96 --> 3758.88
to try to build to try to seem to be

3756.839 --> 3761.88
scientific that's why

3758.88 --> 3765.96
test it again yeah test the same

3761.88 --> 3771.54
gyroscope again I mean the proper way to

3765.96 --> 3771.54
approach it was to get another gyroscope

3771.839 --> 3777.54
the same manufacturing maybe call the

3775.559 --> 3780.8390000000004
manufacturer hey

3777.54 --> 3782.88
I got this ring laser gyro and it seems

3780.839 --> 3785.819
to be drifting

3782.88 --> 3788.4
should it be doing that

3785.819 --> 3791.4
well sir if it's drifting that means

3788.4 --> 3793.38
it's probably broken uh we could

3791.4 --> 3795.2400000000002
probably give you a discount on the

3793.38 --> 3798.42
replacement model

3795.24 --> 3799.5
okay send it to me yeah no no he didn't

3798.42 --> 3803.4
do that

3799.5 --> 3806.579
right instead he thought oh this is

3803.4 --> 3808.619
unique I need to test it some more to

3806.579 --> 3811.619
see if it is legitimate so he keeps

3808.619 --> 3813.9
dragging the broken gyroscope to make

3811.619 --> 3816.119
the drift isolated see if it's not

3813.9 --> 3817.619
something else beside the thing being

3816.119 --> 3820.6800000000003
broken

3817.619 --> 3822.96
it's just Conjuring it's Conjuring it's

3820.68 --> 3825.5989999999997
a magic trick he's Conjuring this

3822.96 --> 3828.18
magical ether [ __ ] out of a broken

3825.599 --> 3831.02
gyroscope

3828.18 --> 3831.02
that's what he's doing

3833.579 --> 3839.3590000000004
and he knows that he's doing that he

3836.819 --> 3839.359
knows it

3841.44 --> 3844.88
he knew it back then

3862.44 --> 3864.92
hmm

3873.96 --> 3876.14
foreign

3876.359 --> 3882.18
you found an article about scientists oh

3880.68 --> 3884.8999999999996
yes

3882.18 --> 3884.8999999999996
of course

3885.96 --> 3891.599
I think I had broken gyroscopes too well

3889.02 --> 3893.819
maybe they just made the whole [ __ ]

3891.599 --> 3897.619
shitty thing up

3893.819 --> 3901.5589999999997
I mean finding an article that described

3897.619 --> 3905.119
scientists yes oh

3901.559 --> 3905.119
super reliable man

3906.359 --> 3911.0989999999997
that's how you know it's real because

3908.7 --> 3913.68
there was a news article

3911.099 --> 3916.04
that talked about scientists doing

3913.68 --> 3916.04
things

3942.18 --> 3946.5589999999997
oh dismissing it yes yes I haven't seen

3945.299 --> 3949.92
anything

3946.559 --> 3951.9
but still it's horseshit gyroscopes

3949.92 --> 3954.319
Don't Drift if they drift they're

3951.9 --> 3954.319
useless

3955.799 --> 3960.599
yeah

3958.02 --> 3962.88
I don't really care for all this

3960.599 --> 3965.88
Conjuring garbage

3962.88 --> 3969.059
we don't the gyroscope drifts

3965.88 --> 3972.299
then it's broken

3969.059 --> 3974.1600000000003
because the point about a gyroscope is

3972.299 --> 3978.059
that it doesn't drift

3974.16 --> 3981.359
it drifts it's broken I don't care what

3978.059 --> 3984.619
a scientific paper or Bob

3981.359 --> 3987.48
or whoever out there does

3984.619 --> 3990.26
supposedly with drifting gyroscopes

3987.48 --> 3992.819
they're all [ __ ]

3990.26 --> 3995.9
gyroscopes are not supposed to drift if

3992.819 --> 3995.9

I was watching cartoons on the

if I had grown up like 20 years later I

would not

4194.42 --> 4197.4400000000005
be the same

I don't know if I would have survived it

4201.86 --> 4205.639999999999
I think I might have gone completely

4203.719 --> 4207.86
apeshit

4236.78 --> 4241.82
internet I mean

4238.52 --> 4245.360000000001
it wasn't this stuff wasn't there I mean

4241.82 --> 4248.659
I at some point I had like a modem

4245.36 --> 4251.54
all I ever I didn't like browse there

4248.659 --> 4252.98
wasn't anything out there

4251.54 --> 4255.32
nothing

4252.98 --> 4258.678999999999
I mean there was a bunch of video games

4255.32 --> 4260.48
that are really simple

4258.679 --> 4263.3
that's what I kind of did with the

4260.48 --> 4267.08
internet that's all

4263.3 --> 4271.6990000000005
yeah now there is like the internet with

4267.08 --> 4275.12
like billions of videos billions

4271.699 --> 4278.599999999999
and endless amounts of text everywhere

4275.12 --> 4280.58
yeah that wasn't all there then I mean

4278.6 --> 4283.88
yeah if you're really going out to

4280.58 --> 4286.719
search for it maybe I wasn't I wasn't

4283.88 --> 4286.719
that interested

4291.38 --> 4298.09
I was much more interested in like what

4293.84 --> 4301.329
my brother had to say or my parents

4298.09 --> 4301.329
[Music]

4322.94 --> 4331.46
okay so there you go

4326.12 --> 4334.34
I was not fully immersed in the internet

4331.46 --> 4337.88
when I was younger I mean the internet

4334.34 --> 4341.360000000001
really only kind of started up with me

4337.88 --> 4344.56
getting actually interested like

4341.36 --> 4344.5599999999995
after my 20s

4348.98 --> 4353.839999999999
that's when things that's like when like

4351.44 --> 4355.82
things like interesting documentary

4353.84 --> 4357.5
things that were exclusive to the

4355.82 --> 4361.58
internet started to go around like

4357.5 --> 4364.46
Zeitgeist and movies from Alex Jones

4361.58 --> 4367.159
and that's suddenly where I actually

4364.46 --> 4369.8
started to see like hey wait

4367.159 --> 4371.839999999999
there's things here

4369.8 --> 4374.84
and that's when I got on the internet

4371.84 --> 4377.84
before that I just was not there I did

4374.84 --> 4381.58
not care I stayed away from it

4377.84 --> 4381.58
made me feel uncomfortable

4382.57 --> 4386.299999999999
[Music]

4384.44 --> 4389.36
rather introduced no he did not

4386.3 --> 4392.84
introduce me to Fe

4389.36 --> 4395.739
no that that would rather be my mother

4392.84 --> 4395.7390000000005
I think

4410.0 --> 4415.6
I don't think my brother even realizes

4412.76 --> 4415.6
the Earth is flat

4417.86 --> 4425.239
it was always like extremely headstrong

4420.92 --> 4429.46
about his View and like you could not he

4425.239 --> 4429.459999999999
would not change it ever

4431.3 --> 4436.219
so he's probably still just

4434.12 --> 4439.82
the same

4436.219 --> 4443.8
in those ways anyway if I got interested

4439.82 --> 4443.799999999999
in the internet because of Napster right

4444.62 --> 4448.82
yeah that one but that's kind of around

4446.48 --> 4450.299999999999

4469.82 --> 4474.58
all started

4471.32 --> 4474.58
around the millennium

4493.52 --> 4498.02
would you change your Google who are you

4496.219 --> 4501.04
asking double yellow

4498.02 --> 4501.040000000001
then why

4515.9 --> 4519.679
you were wondering why you wouldn't feel

4517.82 --> 4523.04
any spin

4519.679 --> 4524.78
okay why was very easily dissuade is

4523.04 --> 4527.0
just like somebody would just have to

4524.78 --> 4528.8
say like yeah we're just too small

4527.0 --> 4529.76
wouldn't feel it and then it's like oh

4528.8 --> 4534.14
okay

4529.76 --> 4536.360000000001
I mean dude I fell for like yeah

4534.14 --> 4539.179
I mean yeah it looks flat but it is

4536.36 --> 4544.659
actually a sphere I mean I would buy

4539.179 --> 4544.659
whatever the [ __ ] they told me yeah

4544.76 --> 4550.1
if I said like look it's perfectly flat

4547.52 --> 4552.8
it's like geometric back then and they

4550.1 --> 4555.92
would tell me no no it just seems like

4552.8 --> 4557.6
that it's actually a ball I would have

4555.92 --> 4560.4800000000005
taken it

4557.6 --> 4563.2390000000005
I would say yes sir

4560.48 --> 4566.5599999999995
I will remember that

4606.26 --> 4609.56
here yeah

4610.219 --> 4616.76
I will never ever again submit to the

4616.76 --> 4621.56

death

4621.56 --> 4625.4800000000005

burn in hell for all eternity

called early exposure that's how people

actually solidify their intelligence a

lot of the time early exposure

5185.56 --> 5190.38

the research no but

5209.32 --> 5212.98
where the hell is he going to research

5214.3 --> 5218.139
don't

5214.92 --> 5223.36
just say like don't believe what some

5218.139 --> 5225.46
group says no inquire figure it out

5223.36 --> 5229.98
if there's something that you don't

5225.46 --> 5229.9800000000005
understand then ask a question about it

5230.86 --> 5235.12
just not just like oh don't believe

5233.02 --> 5236.56
anything anybody says I mean how the

5235.12 --> 5238.78
hell are you going to research anything

5236.56 --> 5241.26
if you can't believe anything anybody

5238.78 --> 5241.259999999999
says

5242.44 --> 5248.5599999999995
you just gotta figure it out ask the

5245.739 --> 5251.919999999999
right questions pay attention to things

5248.56 --> 5254.6990000000005
that might be slipping all kinds of

5251.92 --> 5254.6990000000005
things by you

5262.659 --> 5266.699
a research and platter of their good

5267.82 --> 5274.9

5271.659 --> 5277.659
really how do you understand it

5274.9 --> 5281.5199999999995
did you learn that the little tricksies

5277.659 --> 5281.5199999999995
on how to presuppose the globe

5285.94 --> 5290.62
right well if you want to understand

5288.04 --> 5293.08
Flat Earth it's kind of simple really

5290.62 --> 5295.36
but it can still be tough on you

5293.08 --> 5298.48
mentally or emotionally

5295.36 --> 5300.159
but you basically have to understand the

5298.48 --> 5302.799999999999
housekeeping questions from the Flat

5300.159 --> 5305.799999999999
Earth debates the the show that follows

5302.8 --> 5308.38
up my show over at Nathan Oakley 1980 I

5305.8 --> 5310.84
recommend you watch some of that so live

5308.38 --> 5313.0
show and there's premieres of it with

5310.84 --> 5315.04
the after show and pre-show added onto

5313.0 --> 5316.239
it which are much longer

5315.04 --> 5317.679
right

5316.239 --> 5319.419999999999
what

5317.679 --> 5321.34
there's like a whole bunch of

5319.42 --> 5325.06
housekeeping questions

5321.34 --> 5328.4800000000005
and they basically help you to figure

5325.06 --> 5333.159000000001
out how the globe model universe is

5328.48 --> 5333.159
completely physically impossible

5334.42 --> 5341.38
it's the full works

5337.42 --> 5343.6
four works the most complete picture

5341.38 --> 5347.1990000000005
right

5343.6 --> 5351.219
so for example how can you have gas

5347.199 --> 5355.719
pressure or a vacuum without a container

5351.219 --> 5359.28
to press upon or to prevent the

5355.719 --> 5359.28
surrounding from entering

5359.5 --> 5364.6
filling up the vacuum right

5362.26 --> 5366.58
that's a very important question it's

5364.6 --> 5369.219
just that one question completely

5366.58 --> 5370.8
destroys the illusion of the possibility

5369.219 --> 5374.44
of outer space

5370.8 --> 5377.9800000000005
immediately irrevocably and there is no

5374.44 --> 5380.259999999999
measures against it because and I tried

5377.98 --> 5382.48
as Baldwin right because you could say

5380.26 --> 5385.179
oh but people say it's gravity gravity

5382.48 --> 5387.218999999999
keeps the gas there really so how is it

5385.179 --> 5390.58
doing that

5387.219 --> 5393.46
the bending space time in order for

5390.58 --> 5397.6
in order for the gas to be prevented

5393.46 --> 5400.4800000000005
from moving out because of time

5397.6 --> 5402.159000000001
or something because gas is going to

5400.48 --> 5405.4
expand in all directions to meet the

5402.159 --> 5408.699
available volume which well allegedly

5405.4 --> 5411.0599999999995
according to heliocentrism is infinite

5408.699 --> 5414.46
volume

5411.06 --> 5417.04
well that means since the expansion

5414.46 --> 5419.26
power the force that comes out of the

5417.04 --> 5423.639
gas attempting to expand

5419.26 --> 5426.34
is equal to like equal and opposite to

5423.639 --> 5427.900000000001
like the volume it can go into that's

5426.34 --> 5431.860000000001
quite a lot of power

5427.9 --> 5435.699
now the idea that gravity could keep gas

5431.86 --> 5438.46
to a ball in the face of outer space

5435.699 --> 5441.159
is kind of ridiculous because well the

5438.46 --> 5443.199
amount of force right not talking space

5441.159 --> 5446.739
time bending but the original Newtonian

5443.199 --> 5448.178999999999
Force that gravity supposedly has is

5446.739 --> 5449.379999999999
very minute

5448.179 --> 5453.1
so

5449.38 --> 5454.54
without a container gravity assumed to

5453.1 --> 5457.0
be a force would not have enough

5454.54 --> 5460.36
strength to prevent the gas from

5457.0 --> 5462.219
exploding with insane amount of force in

5460.36 --> 5464.38
all directions to attempt to fill the

5462.219 --> 5469.2390000000005
outer space galaxy

5464.38 --> 5472.179
so that's one housekeeping question one

5469.239 --> 5475.239
yeah that completely and utterly

5472.179 --> 5477.82
destroys heliocentrism

5475.239 --> 5481.659
now here's another one

5477.82 --> 5483.28
yeah that that ball you think it all is

5481.659 --> 5487.839999999999
and we're standing on and all that right

5483.28 --> 5490.96
well in order for the earth to be a ball

5487.84 --> 5493.12
it would have to have a horizon that is

5490.96 --> 5495.1
geometric because well you're standing

5493.12 --> 5499.0
on a ball right well then you would be

5495.1 --> 5500.8
looking at the edge of that ball

5499.0 --> 5505.199
The Horizon would be the edge of the

5500.8 --> 5505.1990000000005
ball and things would go behind it as is

5505.239 --> 5510.759999999999
foretold about ships going over the

5507.639 --> 5515.5
horizon yeah except that's a myth

5510.76 --> 5515.5
because it doesn't happen and

5515.62 --> 5521.58
there is a argument called The Black

5518.679 --> 5524.679
Swan the Black Swan argument

5521.58 --> 5528.04
which is an analogy it's a modest

5524.679 --> 5531.39
tolerance analogy right

5528.04 --> 5532.84
but yeah let me lay it all up

5531.39 --> 5534.6990000000005
[Music]

5532.84 --> 5537.82
I think it's a Carl's popper what's it

5534.699 --> 5541.48
called right who basically

5537.82 --> 5543.699
in his own time like 200 years ago there

5541.48 --> 5546.82
was an argument that there would be only

5543.699 --> 5548.44
white swans because in Europe well all

5546.82 --> 5552.46
the swamps were white

5548.44 --> 5554.44
and well one of these dandies insisted

5552.46 --> 5558.34
yeah I know I'm right there's only white

5554.44 --> 5560.259999999999
swans see all the swans are white so

5558.34 --> 5563.26
yeah somebody that didn't really like

5560.26 --> 5565.4800000000005
that guy that said that traveled all the

5563.26 --> 5567.34
way to what is it Madagascar or South

5565.48 --> 5570.699
Africa or somewhere where there are

5567.34 --> 5572.860000000001
actually black swamps took one with him

5570.699 --> 5574.48
and then brought it back and said like

5572.86 --> 5576.099999999999
ha

5574.48 --> 5578.5
you're wrong

5576.1 --> 5580.719
see you thought that all swarms were

5578.5 --> 5583.48
white you insisted you were correct

5580.719 --> 5586.96
guess what here's a Black Swan you're

5583.48 --> 5589.0
incorrect see not all swans are white

5586.96 --> 5590.76
that's the Black Swan argument the

5589.0 --> 5594.04
original

5590.76 --> 5596.4400000000005
uh the origin of it how it came in to be

5594.04 --> 5598.78
a modus tolerance argument well it

5596.44 --> 5601.178999999999
applies to the globe Earth as well

5598.78 --> 5604.78
because if the globe

5601.179 --> 5607.719
was of the exact spherical proportions

5604.78 --> 5611.44
as it is claimed to be by heliocentrics

5607.719 --> 5613.2390000000005
then the Horizon would be at a very

5611.44 --> 5615.82
specific

5613.239 --> 5617.5
distance at all time because it's

5615.82 --> 5618.94
geometric

5617.5 --> 5621.52
right

5618.94 --> 5625.0
well guess what there are plenty of

5621.52 --> 5626.5
sightings through like p900 cameras and

5625.0 --> 5628.3
all kinds of things

5626.5 --> 5632.32
where there is

5628.3 --> 5634.54
things seen through the camera at an

5632.32 --> 5637.239
extremely low observation I'd say one

5634.54 --> 5640.8
foot above sea level and then things

5637.239 --> 5644.86
like a beach in a distance is still seen

5640.8 --> 5649.06
11 miles away

5644.86 --> 5650.86
with one foot observation height above

5649.06 --> 5653.7390000000005
sea level

5650.86 --> 5657.159
if the Earth was a globe it would be

5653.739 --> 5659.379999999999
impossible at all circumstances

5657.159 --> 5663.28
for that camera to be able to see the

5659.38 --> 5665.7390000000005
beach 11 miles away with only one

5663.28 --> 5668.8
observation one foot observation height

5665.739 --> 5671.0199999999995
it's absolutely impossible geometrically

5668.8 --> 5673.0
therefore we must conclude

5671.02 --> 5675.76
Black Swan

5673.0 --> 5679.3
because there would be no exception to

5675.76 --> 5681.280000000001
the White Swan the geometry claim of

5679.3 --> 5683.62
globe Earth there would be no exception

5681.28 --> 5685.3
yet there is and you can literally do

5683.62 --> 5687.94
that you can take that camera and on a

5685.3 --> 5691.12
bright day not to the beach put it like

5687.94 --> 5693.699
right above sea and you might just be

5691.12 --> 5696.639
able to see like an oil rig or a beach

5693.699 --> 5698.919999999999
very far in the distance even though if

5696.639 --> 5701.5
the Earth was a globe at that one foot

5698.92 --> 5703.84
observation night you would see nothing

5701.5 --> 5706.48
you would see nothing but a bunch of

5703.84 --> 5709.0
waves in front of you always you would

5706.48 --> 5710.98
never see anything behind it because the

5709.0 --> 5713.8
curve would get in the way

5710.98 --> 5716.44
because it's just one foot height

5713.8 --> 5718.6
the curve would always then get in the

5716.44 --> 5720.46
way yet there are plenty of sightings

5718.6 --> 5724.84
where it doesn't

5720.46 --> 5727.54
and because of that Black Swan it cannot

5724.84 --> 5729.76
be the spherical geometry of the

5727.54 --> 5732.34
proportions claimed because there is

5729.76 --> 5735.900000000001
visual exceptions that cannot be

5732.34 --> 5735.900000000001
geometrically accounted for

5737.199 --> 5740.879999999999
so that's the Black Swan argument

5740.95 --> 5744.188999999999
[Music]

5747.4 --> 5751.9
right so I hope you pay attention to

5750.159 --> 5754.48
what I just explained to you these are

5751.9 --> 5756.699
probably the two most

5754.48 --> 5759.459999999999
powerful

5756.699 --> 5763.78
tools you can have to

5759.46 --> 5767.8
basically prove the Earth is not a globe

5763.78 --> 5771.28
not the heliocentric lobe they say it is

5767.8 --> 5773.38
it has to be contained

5771.28 --> 5775.54
because there is gas pressure so there

5773.38 --> 5778.54
has to be a limited volume for the gas

5775.54 --> 5782.32
to be able to fill and it has to be

5778.54 --> 5784.54
effectively cut yeah cut off by barriers

5782.32 --> 5786.4
it would have to be there's no

5784.54 --> 5791.679
alternative option

5786.4 --> 5794.5
because if yeah gas cannot be

5791.679 --> 5795.639
like this without a container to hold it

5794.5 --> 5797.92
in

5795.639 --> 5799.12
so that's one and then there's the Black

5797.92 --> 5802.36
Swan

5799.12 --> 5805.239
it's not a sphere

5802.36 --> 5807.82
it's not spherically geom it's it's not

5805.239 --> 5811.178999999999
the spherical geometry claim cannot be

5807.82 --> 5814.719
there's Black Swan observations that

5811.179 --> 5816.9400000000005
prove it cannot be that geometry

5814.719 --> 5820.06
right so those two are basically the

5816.94 --> 5822.57
best arguments you can have no go 303 I

5820.06 --> 5825.2390000000005
hope you paid attention

5822.57 --> 5829.299999999999
[Music]

5825.239 --> 5831.45
and these are just two from like eight

5829.3 --> 5837.400000000001
but they are the most important ones

5831.45 --> 5838.97
[Music]

5837.4 --> 5842.119
ah is he still here

5838.97 --> 5842.119000000001
[Music]

5845.18 --> 5848.68
[Music]

5851.86 --> 5857.38
yeah that gas pressure is higher the

5854.38 --> 5859.4800000000005
class yeah nobody gives you [ __ ]

5857.38 --> 5862.54
there is gas pressure it doesn't matter

5859.48 --> 5865.98
how it's divided there's gas pressure

5862.54 --> 5865.98
it has to be contained

5866.199 --> 5874.599999999999
yeah you require a a container to be

5871.42 --> 5876.52
able to create a gas pressure gradient

5874.6 --> 5878.8
within that container

5876.52 --> 5880.659000000001
cannot create a gradient without a

5878.8 --> 5884.159000000001
container

5880.659 --> 5884.159
cannot bypass that

5896.04 --> 5901.239
don't knock your grandparents about it

5898.78 --> 5904.179
especially if they're

5901.239 --> 5906.879999999999
that got a stroke no go don't do that

5904.179 --> 5910.02
don't nag your grandparents about learn

5906.88 --> 5910.02
about this for yourself

5916.84 --> 5920.8
unless your grandparents are kind of

5918.82 --> 5923.5599999999995
into that

5920.8 --> 5925.659000000001
I mean if they if they would start

5923.56 --> 5927.400000000001
talking about Flat Earth themselves yeah

5925.659 --> 5930.58
sure

5927.4 --> 5931.659
but I mean don't nag old people with

5930.58 --> 5934.0599999999995
this stuff

5931.659 --> 5937.86
if they're like kind of feeble

5934.06 --> 5937.860000000001
that's a really mean thing to do

5943.179 --> 5950.26
just tell okay good just I mean don't

5947.32 --> 5953.5
expect people around you to basically

5950.26 --> 5955.900000000001
accept the logic of the arguments that I

5953.5 --> 5957.639
shared because people will reject it

5955.9 --> 5961.5
anyway a lot of them because they're

5957.639 --> 5961.5
unable to accept the consequences

5961.54 --> 5967.0
of realizing it so you have to be

5964.96 --> 5968.7390000000005
prepared for that even with your loved

5967.0 --> 5970.239
ones I mean I don't know about your

5968.739 --> 5973.718999999999
grandpa you might be absolutely

5970.239 --> 5976.9
tolerable tolerant about it but

5973.719 --> 5979.96
you don't know unless you've already had

5976.9 --> 5983.159
interactions concerning the subject

5979.96 --> 5983.159
so be careful with that

5984.75 --> 5989.08
[Music]

5986.38 --> 5991.96
could the container be removed after the

5989.08 --> 5995.46
gradient has been astounded and just

5991.96 --> 5995.46
depend yeah but that's the same

5995.92 --> 6002.6990000000005
the non-space is probably the container

6000.36 --> 6005.04
steamy Traveler

6002.699 --> 6007.199
the pole point about

6005.04 --> 6009.06
the container is is that there simply

6007.199 --> 6012.0599999999995
has to be a limited volume that doesn't

6009.06 --> 6015.54
mean a physical barrier that would

6012.06 --> 6018.900000000001
separate this space from another space

6015.54 --> 6021.239
outside it could simply mean there is no

6018.9 --> 6022.799999999999
other space outside there simply is no

6021.239 --> 6025.08
other volume

6022.8 --> 6027.78
available

6025.08 --> 6030.48
no material room

6027.78 --> 6032.88
for things to be in Beyond a certain

6030.48 --> 6034.799999999999
point well that would effectively be a

6032.88 --> 6037.5
container because yeah there's no more

6034.8 --> 6040.62
volume for gas to move into than

6037.5 --> 6043.26
that contains it why would it have to be

6040.62 --> 6045.86
a physical barrier separating it from

6043.26 --> 6045.860000000001
more space

6048.06 --> 6053.76
maybe there just is no more space there

6050.1 --> 6057.3
none space just nothing

6053.76 --> 6057.3
perfect immovable

6057.84 --> 6061.58

6059.699 --> 6065.96

6066.73 --> 6073.478999999999
[Music]

6076.26 --> 6081.179
how is your opinion uh if I don't have

6078.659 --> 6083.159
much of an opinion about that subject

6081.179 --> 6084.36
I mean yeah the northern lights are

6083.159 --> 6086.58
pretty weird

6084.36 --> 6089.46
it seems to be some kind of a plasma

6086.58 --> 6091.199
effect and it is very likely to have

6089.46 --> 6093.12
magnetics involved

6091.199 --> 6095.699
but other than that

6093.12 --> 6097.98
yeah I mean

6095.699 --> 6100.259999999999
it's there I guess

6097.98 --> 6103.259999999999
did you know that apparently or so I've

6100.26 --> 6105.360000000001
heard there's also Southern Lights

6103.26 --> 6108.1990000000005
might it might have been a ruse though

6105.36 --> 6108.199
I'm not sure

6108.96 --> 6112.199
but I heard

6110.52 --> 6115.4400000000005
a couple of times

6112.199 --> 6117.419999999999
but yeah I mean it might be a ruse I

6115.44 --> 6121.46
know there's Northern Lights

6117.42 --> 6121.46
but there might also be Southern Lights

6122.94 --> 6128.5199999999995
right

6125.4 --> 6130.739
so that is interesting right I mean that

6128.52 --> 6133.76
is kind of interesting isn't it

6130.739 --> 6133.759999999999
there are Southern Lights

6148.92 --> 6154.32
really you're gonna go trick your

6151.92 --> 6157.26
friends with flat Earth

6154.32 --> 6158.5199999999995
what do you mean tricking the Earth is

6157.26 --> 6162.0
flat

6158.52 --> 6166.080000000001
don't you know that it is literally flat

6162.0 --> 6169.32
I gave you two perfect

6169.32 --> 6172.5

that's real

6174.64 --> 6179.820000000001
[Music]

6177.36 --> 6182.599999999999
these are confirmable

6179.82 --> 6182.599999999999
facts

6182.82 --> 6190.799999999999
Earth is actually flat there's no doubt

6187.02 --> 6192.540000000001
about it it is it always was and it

6190.8 --> 6195.26
always will be

6192.54 --> 6195.26
flat

6209.4 --> 6214.98
so yeah don't trick your friends it's

6212.4 --> 6218.82
not a trick it's the truth yeah the

6214.98 --> 6221.58
truth is not a trick it is the truth

6218.82 --> 6223.739
it's real it's not a trick

6221.58 --> 6226.44
the trick is making everybody believe

6223.739 --> 6228.799999999999
it's that globe in an outer space even

6226.44 --> 6232.58
though that's logically physically

6228.8 --> 6232.58
absolutely impossible

6233.52 --> 6236.179
foreign

6239.119 --> 6244.32
okay well it's not tricking them

6241.58 --> 6245.82
tricking is fooling you're not tricking

6244.32 --> 6250.44
them you're just

6245.82 --> 6252.36
sharing a well-developed argument

6250.44 --> 6254.96
by the way don't expect any gratitude

6252.36 --> 6254.96
from them

6255.179 --> 6261.119
especially like kids

6257.82 --> 6261.84
can be kind of brutal about that sort of

6261.119 --> 6265.38
thing

6261.84 --> 6268.56
or hurt or both so be careful with that

6265.38 --> 6270.54
I mean Flat Earth is not just a

6268.56 --> 6272.64
light-hearted subject it really isn't

6270.54 --> 6275.839
it's very impactful

6335.46 --> 6341.4
cannot be overcome yeah the Black Swan

6338.82 --> 6343.32
argument and the gas pressure without a

6341.4 --> 6345.179
container argument

6343.32 --> 6348.139
I don't think I could have been more

6345.179 --> 6348.139
elaborate than this

6348.179 --> 6353.52
those are the arguments

6350.4 --> 6357.799999999999
it's not calculations

6353.52 --> 6357.8
it's the nature of the physical

6402.06 --> 6406.139
you and start to distrust you or think

6403.92 --> 6409.46

because that can happen

6422.76 --> 6426.42
you're young just let it sink for a

6425.4 --> 6429.719
while

6448.199 --> 6454.219

like

6484.139 --> 6488.119
yeah I warned you

6510.6 --> 6513.6
no

6517.76 --> 6524.360000000001
that's not the right attitude and I will

6521.04 --> 6524.36
kick you out of my stream

6524.46 --> 6527.9
if you hold on to that

6529.739 --> 6534.0199999999995
yeah you got a life ahead of you

6534.179 --> 6541.4400000000005
nobody needs somebody that's just gonna

6538.619 --> 6545.099999999999
wine and blabber about how the Earth is

6541.44 --> 6549.44
flat all day long yeah there's no nobody

6545.1 --> 6549.4400000000005
wants that nobody's gonna listen to that

6550.199 --> 6554.0599999999995
trust me I've been around

6569.58 --> 6577.5
yeah yeah and I know yeah but that's

6573.48 --> 6581.599999999999
there's already people out there that do

6577.5 --> 6581.6
that and they're very annoying

6584.4 --> 6588.96
what you need to do is keep it to

6586.8 --> 6592.58
yourself

6588.96 --> 6592.58
calmly figure it out

6593.28 --> 6598.619
and share it with the people that you

6596.76 --> 6601.02
know you can trust

6598.619 --> 6603.239
not just think like oh I know something

6601.02 --> 6605.9400000000005
now I'm going to conquer the world with

6603.239 --> 6609.419999999999
it yeah freaking good luck dude doesn't

6605.94 --> 6613.678999999999
work trust me I tried it doesn't work

6609.42 --> 6616.8
you're gonna get in big trouble yeah

6613.679 --> 6619.56
if you just go openly spout about Flat

6616.8 --> 6621.900000000001
Earth at that age you can say your

6619.56 --> 6625.38
future education goodbye because they're

6621.9 --> 6626.82
going to reject you then

6625.38 --> 6629.54
yeah

6626.82 --> 6629.54
you understand

6631.139 --> 6634.34
that's what's going to happen

6634.98 --> 6640.619
so you got to keep it to yourself keep

6637.44 --> 6643.379999999999
it private don't go spouting on about it

6640.619 --> 6645.96
everywhere you're gonna get in trouble

6643.38 --> 6648.179
not with your parents but with the

6645.96 --> 6651.02
system

6648.179 --> 6651.02
foreign

6652.79 --> 6662.0289999999995
[Music]

6666.26 --> 6672.08
has nothing to do with that

6669.719 --> 6672.08
she's

6674.3 --> 6678.9800000000005
just be careful with that [ __ ]

6680.04 --> 6689.82
I mean literally like educations they

6684.96 --> 6692.58
literally reject you if they figure out

6689.82 --> 6697.46
because of public record that you're a

6692.58 --> 6697.46
flat earther they will do that

6697.5 --> 6702.179
yeah

6699.48 --> 6703.86
they'll not tell you they'll do that no

6702.179 --> 6707.04
you'll find out

6703.86 --> 6710.0
after the fact after you turn out to be

6707.04 --> 6710.0
rejected everywhere

6719.58 --> 6723.92
what examples do I have well

6724.139 --> 6729.9800000000005
how about go [ __ ] yourself and get the

6727.139 --> 6729.9800000000005
[ __ ] out of here

6739.38 --> 6744.719
I'm trying to spare somebody a lot of

6742.44 --> 6748.379999999999
misery in their life here through their

6744.719 --> 6753.02
momentary enthusiasm yeah

6748.38 --> 6753.02
it's not time for examples

6760.54 --> 6763.76
[Music]

6779.94 --> 6784.739
instead of hiding it

6781.86 --> 6787.92
no no it wouldn't

6784.739 --> 6791.9
it's not effective to shove things in

6787.92 --> 6791.9
people's faces that they can't handle

6795.659 --> 6800.759999999999
yeah that's why I

6798.06 --> 6803.400000000001
I only talk about Flat Earth

6800.76 --> 6805.92
when people bring it up

6803.4 --> 6810.599999999999
or it naturally will come up and then I

6805.92 --> 6813.92
build very carefully towards it

6810.6 --> 6813.92
that's what I do

6843.02 --> 6848.659000000001
okay yeah suit yourself I mean I'm

6847.02 --> 6850.9800000000005
taking you're an adult

6848.659 --> 6853.0199999999995
Ronaldo do whatever you want man it's

6850.98 --> 6854.699
your choice if you're really young you

6853.02 --> 6857.320000000001
don't always understand the consequences

6854.699 --> 6860.5199999999995
of doing these things

6857.32 --> 6860.5199999999995
[Music]

6881.52 --> 6886.56
Why YouTube have flares if it is wrong

6885.119 --> 6888.78
well

6886.56 --> 6891.619000000001
because people are just interested

6888.78 --> 6891.619
that's why

6893.88 --> 6898.139
how old were you when you decided Flat

6896.219 --> 6900.679
Earth was the way to go

6898.139 --> 6900.679
35

6908.28 --> 6912.96
but I've heard of the Earth being flat

6911.1 --> 6915.0
for quite a while

6912.96 --> 6917.58
I mean I've been confronted with that

6915.0 --> 6922.52
like pre-teen team

6917.58 --> 6922.5199999999995
in my 20s time and time again

6922.92 --> 6928.92
and a lot of those times I actually

6925.739 --> 6931.5
realized wow like it is flat but I was

6928.92 --> 6933.4800000000005
just really scared of it

6931.5 --> 6937.26
of like

6933.48 --> 6940.259999999999
yeah putting it down in the open

6937.26 --> 6942.0
I only started doing that in 2015 with

6940.26 --> 6944.76
the the whole YouTube

6942.0 --> 6945.659
Flat Earth Revelation Mark zardin and

6944.76 --> 6948.96
all that

6945.659 --> 6951.9
that's when I realized oh

6948.96 --> 6953.28
so now there is actually a place to do

6951.9 --> 6955.199
that

6953.28 --> 6957.3
so that I can actually keep

6955.199 --> 6961.0199999999995
communicating about it

6957.3 --> 6963.3
instead of like just keeping it in until

6961.02 --> 6965.4800000000005
I forget again because that happens a

6963.3 --> 6965.4800000000005
lot

6967.199 --> 6970.879999999999
I used to forget a lot about it

6971.219 --> 6973.699
what

6975.0 --> 6978.02
what's going on here

6992.52 --> 6996.2390000000005
wow

6994.02 --> 6999.42
what a weirdo

6996.239 --> 7003.879999999999
yeah it was G I mean that person was

6999.42 --> 7003.88
probably an actor I don't trust it

7006.139 --> 7011.26
because I think that was

7008.6 --> 7011.26
again

7014.96 --> 7018.9800000000005
come with my chat as huge today where is

7018.139 --> 7021.82
he

7018.98 --> 7021.82
the other kid

7032.0 --> 7035.5
wait is that double jello

7037.099 --> 7042.02
nay

7038.54 --> 7044.619
Nemo that's the guy right I think Nemo

7042.02 --> 7047.360000000001
really is a 12 year old kid he he

7044.619 --> 7052.179
responds properly it seems like this

7047.36 --> 7052.179
no-go guy is just so disgusting pervert

7052.719 --> 7058.88
acting like a little kid it just really

7056.659 --> 7062.08
stood out it was way

7058.88 --> 7062.08
just not

7062.599 --> 7066.56
he was not sensitive enough to be an

7064.82 --> 7068.84
actual young kid

7066.56 --> 7072.580000000001
wasn't real

7068.84 --> 7072.58
so yeah good call there LSG

7082.34 --> 7087.860000000001
in your opinion that yeah no no

7085.639 --> 7089.78
I don't think so

7087.86 --> 7092.659
I don't think so

7089.78 --> 7095.36
does not feel like a real kid he acted

7092.659 --> 7099.759999999999
very weird about it

7095.36 --> 7099.759999999999
all these nonsensical references

7101.42 --> 7106.219
but like he was just trying to seem like

7104.659 --> 7109.28
he was a kid

7106.219 --> 7111.7390000000005
but it didn't seem like a kid really

7109.28 --> 7115.58
so what I said was basically just

7111.739 --> 7117.44
Universal to actual kids so including to

7115.58 --> 7119.599
Nemo

7117.44 --> 7122.36
but I don't think that this guy was

7119.599 --> 7124.400000000001
actually a kid uh anyway he's he's out

7122.36 --> 7127.28
