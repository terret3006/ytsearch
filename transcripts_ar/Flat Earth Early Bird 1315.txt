[Music]

109.439 --> 112.079
clouded

112.64 --> 118.399
a couple of clear spots though

116.24 --> 120.0
but yeah there's not really a lot of sun

118.399 --> 122.0
there's been moments where there's some

120.0 --> 124.32
sun but it's kind of like

122.0 --> 126.64
clouded and rainy here and there not

124.32 --> 128.879
constantly though but

126.64 --> 131.36
and it has cooled off even more than it

128.879 --> 133.84
did yesterday

131.36 --> 136.84
last time i checked it was 18 degrees

133.84 --> 136.84
celsius

145.04 --> 149.07999999999998
oh gamma freeze

156.239 --> 158.8
what the

161.04 --> 165.599
what the hell

162.879 --> 169.79999999999998
is going on

165.599 --> 169.79999999999998
my camera is not unfreezing

173.12 --> 178.28
hold on

174.239 --> 178.28
something weird going on

186.159 --> 189.159
what

198.64 --> 202.29
what uh

200.56 --> 203.519
okay

202.29 --> 205.67999999999998
[Music]

203.519 --> 209.20000000000002
ah

205.68 --> 209.20000000000002
okay there was what

209.28 --> 212.28
wow

213.12 --> 217.28
i didn't do anything that last second

215.519 --> 219.04
like there was a weird delay and then

217.28 --> 221.44
suddenly it all happened

219.04 --> 221.44
okay

222.56 --> 226.48
uh what's going on

224.159 --> 228.39999999999998
anyway hello mike sidunich first in chat

226.48 --> 234.28
good to see you

228.4 --> 234.28
it is tuesday the 26th of july 2022

234.9 --> 237.969
[Music]

240.159 --> 244.07999999999998
susie s

241.36 --> 244.08
good to see you

253.439 --> 257.799
yeah it's now 90 degrees celsius

268.96 --> 273.52
that's a bit odd though like originally

271.6 --> 275.68
the weather predictions were not that it

273.52 --> 278.0
would go down the temperature would go

275.68 --> 279.68
down that much

278.0 --> 283.16
so

279.68 --> 283.16
they are off

283.44 --> 286.08
i've noticed that they are off more

285.12 --> 287.759
often

286.08 --> 289.68
they get the swings of what's going to

287.759 --> 291.36
happen but usually not the peaks and

289.68 --> 294.16
valleys

291.36 --> 294.16
the temperature

294.32 --> 299.28
that's a lot cooler yes it is

296.96 --> 303.44
still it's still warm enough to keep on

299.28 --> 303.44
my shirt inside and all that

304.08 --> 309.15999999999997
not to

305.52 --> 309.15999999999997
dress up further

310.72 --> 312.96000000000004
uh

315.52 --> 320.479
right

317.039 --> 324.199
so yeah yesterday's show was long

320.479 --> 324.199
it's a great show

325.36 --> 330.56
i like the title i like the subjects

328.4 --> 333.67999999999995
and it was long and yet

330.56 --> 338.36
it was just very active

333.68 --> 338.36
so i'm very happy with yesterday's show

342.8 --> 345.12
uh

346.56 --> 351.32
been catching up more on own benjamin

352.56 --> 357.84
where am i now net well where am i at

355.6 --> 357.84000000000003
now

358.4 --> 364.4
yeah the friday show

361.52 --> 366.79999999999995
so there's already a monday show

364.4 --> 369.59999999999997
i hope to catch up on

366.8 --> 369.6
that today

372.16 --> 377.199
but yeah owen has been

374.24 --> 377.199
like i don't know

377.36 --> 381.08000000000004
like what he's been doing

382.319 --> 385.8
it's more subtlety

413.68 --> 416.68
uh

429.919 --> 432.919
right

436.56 --> 442.16
i went to bed pretty early yesterday

439.919 --> 444.4
i've been doing a lot of like super

442.16 --> 448.0
interesting things

444.4 --> 448.0
what's gimbap stream

448.319 --> 454.24
in chat that was pretty cool

451.039 --> 454.24
that's pretty much it

460.479 --> 463.28
ah wait

463.36 --> 466.8
john store had a video

467.12 --> 474.44
yeah that video from john thor was

471.039 --> 474.44
pretty interesting

479.52 --> 485.35999999999996
like there's a piece in there like

482.96 --> 488.0
i forgot that

485.36 --> 490.639
so yeah john thor's video might be very

488.0 --> 496.479
interesting to watch

490.639 --> 496.479
it's like less than 30 minutes 27

498.8 --> 503.44
but it basically reminded me of

500.96 --> 506.79999999999995
something that

503.44 --> 510.56
either through visions or the germs with

506.8 --> 513.76
guy i was informed about even like

510.56 --> 515.839
20 years ago or something

513.76 --> 517.4399999999999
and i remember seeing i've seen that

515.839 --> 519.36
footage before

517.44 --> 523.7600000000001
like i distinctly remember seeing it

519.36 --> 526.08
before about an escape hatch

523.76 --> 528.24
an escape hatch for like the apollo

526.08 --> 530.5600000000001
astronauts

528.24 --> 533.12
because here's the thing

530.56 --> 535.5999999999999
the rockets are so loud

533.12 --> 537.839
that at the actual if the astronauts

535.6 --> 540.8000000000001
were at the actual distance

537.839 --> 542.48
like in the capsule above

540.8 --> 544.959
then the sheer amount of noise those

542.48 --> 548.72
rocket engines would make

544.959 --> 549.68
would literally kill them

548.72 --> 550.9590000000001
like

549.68 --> 554.8
literally

550.959 --> 557.1999999999999
and i forgot about that like oh [ __ ]

554.8 --> 559.5999999999999
so they have literally like an escape a

557.2 --> 562.1600000000001
trickery escape hatch built in into a

559.6 --> 564.08
sound safe room

562.16 --> 566.399
for the astronauts that at that time

564.08 --> 568.8000000000001
were still going into

566.399 --> 571.92
the rocket

568.8 --> 573.92
right was much less cgi type era but

571.92 --> 576.64
they built that whole thing

573.92 --> 579.279
just for the trick

576.64 --> 579.279
incredible

586.16 --> 589.8389999999999
like it's one of those things that's

587.68 --> 592.0
just so mind blowing that you almost

589.839 --> 595.519
have to forget about it again

592.0 --> 595.519
this is just too surreal

596.959 --> 601.1199999999999
you've seen the escape hatch video yeah

599.44 --> 605.519
well i've seen it a long time ago i

601.12 --> 608.079
don't remember exactly where and when

605.519 --> 610.8
but i remember that i just like

608.079 --> 614.3599999999999
i don't know what i'm looking at

610.8 --> 614.3599999999999
i don't understand

619.36 --> 623.399
anyway hello pj c-net

644.64 --> 649.8
a turret 306 good to see you

667.44 --> 669.7600000000001
yeah

669.839 --> 673.7600000000001
feeling a little wonky

671.839 --> 676.48
i think it's because of just the the

673.76 --> 677.68
amount temperature shift and the moist

676.48 --> 680.5600000000001
in the air

677.68 --> 680.56
and what it is

681.2 --> 686.279
i'm sure i'll recover as the show

683.279 --> 686.279
progresses

688.38 --> 691.559
[Music]

715.2 --> 719.6800000000001
yeah i also watched back one of the

717.2 --> 721.6
premieres from nathan

719.68 --> 722.8
fed i think it was friday could have

721.6 --> 724.399
been

722.8 --> 726.88
thursday

724.399 --> 729.68
but like some of these scenes where i

726.88 --> 731.519
get involved they get like really messy

729.68 --> 733.4399999999999
and rumpassy and i can barely even make

731.519 --> 736.72
out what i'm saying

733.44 --> 736.72
it's kind of disappointing

737.12 --> 741.44
like i'm i'm really being rumpussed by

739.2 --> 744.1600000000001
the guys sometimes

741.44 --> 746.399
i don't understand why they don't see

744.16 --> 746.399
that

754.16 --> 757.7199999999999
but whatever

770.32 --> 774.1600000000001
right

771.44 --> 776.48
so what's going on with you guys

774.16 --> 779.1999999999999
anything interesting happen any

776.48 --> 781.839
interesting videos or articles you've

779.2 --> 781.839
bumped into

783.44 --> 786.44
uh

786.52 --> 789.73
[Music]

822.0 --> 826.399
wow

824.16 --> 829.76
there's just some really weird random

826.399 --> 831.92
people following me by the way

829.76 --> 833.4399999999999
which is absolutely fine

831.92 --> 837.12
but it's just like

833.44 --> 841.0790000000001
yeah just people that are just

837.12 --> 841.079
like oh okay

844.959 --> 849.5999999999999
i think that maybe i did because i don't

846.959 --> 853.199
know how things really work on twitter

849.6 --> 857.6800000000001
i've never really done twitter before

853.199 --> 859.68
i guess just people just randomly

857.68 --> 861.12
check others out

859.68 --> 862.959
everybody's just like oh follow this

861.12 --> 864.5600000000001
follow that follow that and then they're

862.959 --> 866.3199999999999
probably going to unfollow once they

864.56 --> 868.8389999999999
figure out it isn't exactly what they

866.32 --> 872.639
were looking for but

868.839 --> 876.8800000000001
anyway i'm off work until monday

872.639 --> 876.88
because you refuse to covet dust okay

882.24 --> 885.44
is that good or bad i mean it's good

884.0 --> 887.6
that you didn't take the test because

885.44 --> 888.399
those tests

887.6 --> 890.72
like

888.399 --> 893.04
especially if they like try to get in

890.72 --> 894.9590000000001
your nose and all that those are like

893.04 --> 896.959
really bad they leave

894.959 --> 899.5189999999999
toxic chemicals behind

896.959 --> 901.1199999999999
don't do that so

899.519 --> 903.68
i hope you're not gonna get into like

901.12 --> 905.279
financial trouble or anything though

903.68 --> 907.5999999999999
having a week

905.279 --> 907.6
off

908.56 --> 913.5699999999999
hmm

910.35 --> 913.57
[Music]

921.279 --> 927.32
my uni wants to get

924.0 --> 927.32
you tested

928.639 --> 930.88
why

939.279 --> 942.959
i mean you've been

941.12 --> 944.48
i i don't know how long you've been at

942.959 --> 946.3199999999999
the uh

944.48 --> 948.88
university but if you already been

946.32 --> 952.399
studying there then like to for them to

948.88 --> 952.399
just give those demands

952.72 --> 958.399
when you're already been there that

954.8 --> 958.399
makes absolutely no sense

959.12 --> 965.6
i mean if they demand it as like an

961.759 --> 967.519
entry demand that's another thing right

965.6 --> 969.36
but if you're already running at the

967.519 --> 971.44
university if they then suddenly out of

969.36 --> 972.72
nowhere start demanding these tests and

971.44 --> 974.8800000000001
[ __ ]

972.72 --> 976.9590000000001
that is

974.88 --> 978.56
i don't know that doesn't make any sense

976.959 --> 982.8389999999999
to me

978.56 --> 982.8389999999999
you're gonna make fix okay

984.8 --> 988.88
well maybe if you do that

986.639 --> 989.759
maybe you should just be talking about

988.88 --> 993.8
it

989.759 --> 993.8000000000001
on the internet territory

999.759 --> 1003.92
there by the way i'm talking of which

1002.24 --> 1006.24
there was like

1003.92 --> 1008.959
dutch articles

1006.24 --> 1011.6800000000001
referring to how certain doctors also

1008.959 --> 1014.6389999999999
just have like doctors

1011.68 --> 1018.079
having fake corona

1014.639 --> 1018.0790000000001
vaccination passports

1018.24 --> 1023.48
what's that yesterday was an article

1020.48 --> 1023.48
there

1025.919 --> 1030.959
see but i think it's referencing yeah

1028.72 --> 1034.52
canada

1030.959 --> 1034.52
canadian doctors

1041.52 --> 1046.959
so but yeah i predicted that could and

1044.72 --> 1049.039
might happen

1046.959 --> 1050.8400000000001
like even into 2020

1049.039 --> 1053.919
remember

1050.84 --> 1056.0
that was like yeah uh

1053.919 --> 1056.7990000000002
well whatever you do don't take that

1056.0 --> 1059.44
shot

1056.799 --> 1061.44
that's insane

1059.44 --> 1063.8400000000001
and you could probably

1061.44 --> 1068.3200000000002
just get a deal out of it

1063.84 --> 1068.32
and just have a fact a fake

1069.12 --> 1074.559
registry of being vaccinated i mean like

1071.76 --> 1077.84
what harm can it technically do like the

1074.559 --> 1080.32
the actual disease

1077.84 --> 1082.799
the the model of that what they claim it

1080.32 --> 1084.8799999999999
is like that doesn't even exist

1082.799 --> 1086.48
it's all enough based on a false premise

1084.88 --> 1088.96
anyway

1086.48 --> 1090.16
so it doesn't technically matter if you

1088.96 --> 1091.679
fake it

1090.16 --> 1094.4
but

1091.679 --> 1096.5590000000002
yeah it might have legal implications

1094.4 --> 1096.5590000000002
so

1099.76 --> 1104.039
hello guys good to see you

1109.52 --> 1114.6399999999999
well yeah pg seen it look

1112.0 --> 1117.919
it all depends on the context right

1114.64 --> 1120.8400000000001
if terret's already paid down for the

1117.919 --> 1125.1200000000001
university right he's already got the

1120.84 --> 1127.52
bills if they then after that point

1125.12 --> 1131.1999999999998
demand such a thing

1127.52 --> 1131.2
that is like racketeering

1131.679 --> 1137.52
i mean if it was a demand before

1135.2 --> 1140.32
he entered the university then it can

1137.52 --> 1142.559
literally be his choice right

1140.32 --> 1145.9189999999999
but if he's already paid down to be

1142.559 --> 1148.799
there and then they suddenly bar his

1145.919 --> 1151.3600000000001
his his presence because of that that is

1148.799 --> 1155.76
just racketeering

1151.36 --> 1155.76
that's blackmail medical blackmail

1157.12 --> 1161.12
i mean if they really insist on that

1159.6 --> 1163.76
[ __ ] territ

1161.12 --> 1166.2399999999998
then i'd almost consider getting a

1163.76 --> 1169.76
lawyer to just get your money back

1166.24 --> 1169.76
i'm that serious

1173.76 --> 1178.12
getting it not meant what

1179.28 --> 1183.12
okay

1180.4 --> 1183.1200000000001
i'm just saying

1185.039 --> 1190.0
you handle it however you think is best

1187.84 --> 1192.559
tear it i'm just saying if

1190.0 --> 1194.16
if you've already paid to go to the

1192.559 --> 1197.36
university there

1194.16 --> 1200.16
and then they demand you you do this

1197.36 --> 1204.6399999999999
medical experiment

1200.16 --> 1204.64
or you can't come that's just like

1204.72 --> 1210.559
stealing your money

1207.679 --> 1212.0
with with medical blackmail that it that

1210.559 --> 1214.1589999999999
should be

1212.0 --> 1217.12
not necessarily even like whether it is

1214.159 --> 1219.1200000000001
real or not but just that action in my

1217.12 --> 1220.8799999999999
opinion should be

1219.12 --> 1223.76
prosecutable

1220.88 --> 1223.7600000000002
internationally

1233.52 --> 1238.24
right so i'm already yeah i'm just

1235.84 --> 1240.8799999999999
trying to prepare you mentally

1238.24 --> 1243.679
that you might want to do that you might

1240.88 --> 1246.3200000000002
want to consult a lawyer

1243.679 --> 1248.64
like what if they look into like oh wait

1246.32 --> 1251.2
but this is a fake what if they really

1248.64 --> 1253.2
go and like insist right well then

1251.2 --> 1256.64
they're trying to effectively rob you of

1253.2 --> 1256.64
your tuition money

1256.799 --> 1261.4
you should be able to sue for that

1268.08 --> 1272.08
the court is on your side okay that's

1269.84 --> 1275.36
good to hear at least terrored

1272.08 --> 1276.8799999999999
glad glad of that that's very helpful

1275.36 --> 1279.1999999999998
i mean if you don't have the carts on

1276.88 --> 1280.7990000000002
your side with that [ __ ] that's when the

1279.2 --> 1284.0
real

1280.799 --> 1287.6399999999999
creepy stuff starts happening

1284.0 --> 1287.64
so good on you

1288.44 --> 1292.069
[Music]

1298.159 --> 1303.2800000000002
yeah blackmail well look

1300.72 --> 1305.1200000000001
technically it's not yeah it's stored up

1303.28 --> 1307.52
in that range of blackmail but blackmail

1305.12 --> 1310.0
is like secret right it's like keeping a

1307.52 --> 1310.0
secret

1310.559 --> 1315.44
so it's more like racketeering just like

1312.64 --> 1318.0
oh you paid money for this service and

1315.44 --> 1319.28
now we're gonna put an extra demand on

1318.0 --> 1321.919
top of it

1319.28 --> 1325.039
or we will decline you that service that

1321.919 --> 1325.039
you already paid for

1325.679 --> 1331.24
that's basically the formula what would

1328.0 --> 1331.24
be happening

1331.55 --> 1334.72
[Music]

1339.2 --> 1343.159
right because that matters

1345.33 --> 1348.8799999999999
[Music]

1347.36 --> 1350.799
right and if

1348.88 --> 1353.0390000000002
if that yeah

1350.799 --> 1355.12
if it's not just the bluff and it's

1353.039 --> 1356.799
actually all voluntary it's like a

1355.12 --> 1358.799
little sort of a cult thing it doesn't

1356.799 --> 1362.6399999999999
really matter like they can't actually

1358.799 --> 1364.48
kick you off that university

1362.64 --> 1368.64
then

1364.48 --> 1372.0
yeah then it's different but if

1368.64 --> 1375.44
yeah they should if they really mean it

1372.0 --> 1379.44
then as they bring forth that demand

1375.44 --> 1382.0
like you have to get mexico passport

1379.44 --> 1383.76
or you can't get in well then they on

1382.0 --> 1386.88
top of that just for the legal

1383.76 --> 1389.44
implications should also offer you

1386.88 --> 1390.64
okay and if you don't or can't for some

1389.44 --> 1393.76
reason

1390.64 --> 1396.159
then we will offer you like the rest of

1393.76 --> 1397.12
your tuition money back

1396.159 --> 1398.88
right

1397.12 --> 1399.76
if they did that

1398.88 --> 1403.0390000000002
then

1399.76 --> 1405.28
then i'd say they'd be covered

1403.039 --> 1409.12
but are they really going to do that

1405.28 --> 1409.12
right give you all that money back

1409.919 --> 1415.44
they'd be literally just stripping their

1412.159 --> 1416.5590000000002
own university income if they do that

1415.44 --> 1418.96
but if they

1416.559 --> 1421.2
did it just

1418.96 --> 1424.559
like racketeering set up then they'd

1421.2 --> 1425.8400000000001
risk like heavy prosecution so

1424.559 --> 1427.76
anyway

1425.84 --> 1429.039
i'm looking a little bit too much into

1427.76 --> 1431.6
this

1429.039 --> 1436.52
but yeah it could be very important

1431.6 --> 1436.52
how you how you deal with this early on

1447.679 --> 1451.279
all right so just keep that in mind if

1450.0 --> 1453.44
you're gonna run into trouble and

1451.279 --> 1454.559
they're gonna bar you you already paid

1453.44 --> 1458.64
for that

1454.559 --> 1460.8799999999999
you should be able to be paid damages

1458.64 --> 1462.48
so keep that in mind

1460.88 --> 1464.3200000000002
you're you're technically in a good

1462.48 --> 1466.4

have to of course

1744.88 --> 1749.1200000000001
i mean i'm not trying to

1747.44 --> 1750.96
expose you

1749.12 --> 1754.2399999999998
to the trolls or anything although i

1750.96 --> 1756.559
really don't see how they could get it

1754.24 --> 1756.559
yeah

1759.44 --> 1763.48
how they could get in the way

1773.84 --> 1779.32
our speaker is acting up oh

1776.32 --> 1779.32
okay

1795.6 --> 1800.799

computer like what what does that mean

1836.48 --> 1842.0
physics chemistry mathematics okay

right so that's like the basic

1842.0 --> 1844.48
package

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
so you're just studying to become like a

rocket engineer

1934.559 --> 1939.9189999999999
it sounds pretty amazing

nasa lying about everything like as long

1943.039 --> 1946.32
as you could be like yeah but i

1944.799 --> 1949.039
still believe in

1946.32 --> 1952.32
that the earth is flat i'm not gonna

1949.039 --> 1956.0
like rub that off on my company or this

1952.32 --> 1957.76
disrupt pr situations right but i have

1956.0 --> 1959.2
my own if you're just allowed to have

1957.76 --> 1960.64
your own opinion that would be pretty

1959.2 --> 1964.96
badass

1960.64 --> 1964.96
being a rocket engineer flat earther

1965.2 --> 1968.159
i mean why not

1971.36 --> 1977.6399999999999
it's gonna save you a lot on calculation

welcome to the stream

2001.039 --> 2008.96
infiltrate nasa now

2004.159 --> 2008.96
susie s like territ is in india

2009.279 --> 2013.919
i don't think nasa is really gonna allow

2011.6 --> 2014.84
flat earthers

2013.919 --> 2016.3200000000002
in there

2014.84 --> 2019.84

2016.32 --> 2022.399
but like the indian

space organization might

2022.399 --> 2026.559
under strict

2025.039 --> 2028.399
like

2026.559 --> 2030.32
you're not supposed to talk about how

2028.399 --> 2032.1589999999999
the earth is in the globe

exclude

even for like the globe machinations and

2066.639 --> 2069.679
the tour the the

2068.32 --> 2073.04
the shows

2069.679 --> 2075.52
that they put on for the world

2073.04 --> 2078.32
it would be pretty handy to have a flat

2078.32 --> 2082.48
blabber mouth

2080.24 --> 2085.04
that isn't a [ __ ] okay you have to be

2082.48 --> 2088.159
just a smart person that gets it that

2085.04 --> 2091.359
gets the mechanical parts of it

2088.159 --> 2093.76
because they could like help

2091.359 --> 2095.52
with the technical side

2093.76 --> 2097.8390000000004
because they actually understand what's

2095.52 --> 2097.839
real

2098.079 --> 2104.88
it would be pretty helpful to have flat

2100.72 --> 2107.2
earthers in your space organization

2104.88 --> 2111.7200000000003
as like an anchor point so that people

2107.2 --> 2111.72
don't get lost in their own fantasy

2116.079 --> 2120.6400000000003
jpl a scientist came to india and you

2118.4 --> 2123.28
attended the conference wow i would too

2120.64 --> 2125.12
that sounds very interesting

2123.28 --> 2139.21
what did he talk about

2125.12 --> 2139.21
[Music]

2142.48 --> 2145.48
magpie

2146.56 --> 2152.119
what if they already have

2148.72 --> 2152.1189999999997
well they might

2158.0 --> 2162.0
this boy where's borders boy i didn't

2159.599 --> 2162.0
see him

2167.44 --> 2172.68
did you see that where

2169.68 --> 2172.68
what

2174.24 --> 2178.8599999999997
oh

2174.83 --> 2178.86
[Music]

2179.839 --> 2184.7999999999997
ah

2180.88 --> 2186.8
i had the top chat on and the top chat

2184.8 --> 2188.4
left borders boys

2186.8 --> 2191.8390000000004
message out

2188.4 --> 2191.839
isn't that just special

2193.04 --> 2199.2
probably because he's talking about

2195.68 --> 2200.3799999999997
he's using the word vaccinated

2199.2 --> 2217.9199999999996
huh

2200.38 --> 2219.599
[Music]

2217.92 --> 2221.28
right but anyway

2219.599 --> 2223.839
look it doesn't really matter how what

2221.28 --> 2227.119
the percentage of alleged

2223.839 --> 2229.2799999999997
earth being vaccinated is

2227.119 --> 2231.119
the percentage is always going to go

2229.28 --> 2232.48
down

2231.119 --> 2234.2400000000002
why

2232.48 --> 2236.2400000000002
because

2234.24 --> 2238.4799999999996
vaccinated die

2236.24 --> 2240.56
the unvaccinated don't so that

2238.48 --> 2243.44
percentage is always just going to die

2240.56 --> 2246.16
down again

2243.44 --> 2246.16
and that's good

2246.72 --> 2251.2799999999997
they're going to keep telling you oh

2248.56 --> 2253.2
everybody's vaccinated when it will turn

2251.28 --> 2255.28
out that at a certain point when they

2253.2 --> 2256.96
will still say that that like nobody is

2255.28 --> 2258.6400000000003
vaccinated because all the vaccinated

2256.96 --> 2260.8
are dead

2258.64 --> 2264.5989999999997
they will still say oh everybody right

2260.8 --> 2264.599
because peer pressure

2270.43 --> 2273.64
[Music]

2274.4 --> 2280.4
just speculating

2276.32 --> 2281.01
seven moon around me is like mechanism

2280.4 --> 2283.119
uh

2281.01 --> 2285.8390000000004
[Music]

2283.119 --> 2285.839
sure

2288.48 --> 2291.839
it is a cyclical

2292.72 --> 2297.68
mechanism sure

2294.56 --> 2300.72
it's not a physical mechanism i i like

2297.68 --> 2302.24
to say it's a six-dimensional

2300.72 --> 2303.359
well

2302.24 --> 2304.5699999999997
yeah

2303.359 --> 2306.24
a six-dimensional

2304.57 --> 2308.7200000000003
[Music]

2306.24 --> 2312.7599999999998
object

2308.72 --> 2312.7599999999998
a mechanism of the heavens

2321.1 --> 2324.2999999999997
[Music]

2329.44 --> 2334.7200000000003
so they even sense in the chat of that

2331.76 --> 2338.4
word well in the top chat they don't

2334.72 --> 2340.3999999999996
consider it to be top tier commentary

2338.4 --> 2342.56
so they're like oh no a lot of people

2340.4 --> 2344.0
don't want to hear about that

2342.56 --> 2346.96
yes

2344.0 --> 2349.599
it's not suitable for the wider

2346.96 --> 2351.44
easy going public

2349.599 --> 2355.7200000000003
right and that's why

2351.44 --> 2355.7200000000003
whenever you have a live chat

2356.32 --> 2363.599
the top chat is always the default

2359.44 --> 2365.599
selected when you refresh the page

2363.599 --> 2368.32
right it's always at top chat you have

2365.599 --> 2369.6800000000003
to manually click it to set the live

2368.32 --> 2370.96
chat

2369.68 --> 2372.96
so it is like

2370.96 --> 2375.359
soft censorship

2372.96 --> 2377.28
if you take a little extra effort you do

2375.359 --> 2379.68
get the bad

2377.28 --> 2380.88
deemed to be bad words you still get

2379.68 --> 2382.64
them

2380.88 --> 2385.04
if you don't notice you're just gonna

2382.64 --> 2385.04
miss it

2395.359 --> 2400.879
anyhow

2397.09 --> 2400.8790000000004
[Music]

2403.55 --> 2410.989
[Music]

2414.4 --> 2419.359
so yeah do we all think it's a the

2416.88 --> 2420.56
population attempt

2419.359 --> 2424.7599999999998
well

2420.56 --> 2424.7599999999998
it's kind of overk

2431.119 --> 2436.0
and even if it

2432.88 --> 2438.48
in some people's minds isn't

2436.0 --> 2440.8
then practically it is still

2438.48 --> 2443.839
working like that whether that was the

2440.8 --> 2443.8390000000004
intention or not

2444.319 --> 2447.72
so yeah

2479.839 --> 2481.92
you

2503.04 --> 2506.44
right anyhow

2509.359 --> 2513.839
i must

2510.96 --> 2513.839
have to show

2515.04 --> 2518.44
that's this

2522.24 --> 2528.16
okay hey eric debate just had another

2524.96 --> 2528.16
video interesting

2528.56 --> 2533.44
i think i'd like to watch that at some

2531.119 --> 2533.44
point

2534.24 --> 2537.24
hmm

2553.04 --> 2557.68
all right anyway any feedback on

2555.68 --> 2559.9199999999996
yesterday's show

2557.68 --> 2563.1189999999997
i mean does everybody here understand

2559.92 --> 2566.48
what no none space is

2563.119 --> 2566.48
now you get it

2566.72 --> 2570.24
don't

2567.599 --> 2572.48
don't need to agree with the concept i'm

2570.24 --> 2574.85
just asking if you actually understand

2572.48 --> 2577.909
what it is

2574.85 --> 2577.909
[Music]

2581.48 --> 2586.32
[Music]

2593.89 --> 2597.02
[Music]

2623.2 --> 2628.48
it yeah well gas it isn't just a

2625.359 --> 2629.359
coincidence it can't be

2628.48 --> 2631.52
like

2629.359 --> 2635.52
the sky clock it really is a clock it

2631.52 --> 2637.119
was made as a clock mechanism

2635.52 --> 2640.0
with that purpose

2637.119 --> 2642.88
it wasn't just some random forces

2640.0 --> 2645.44
like a bunch of marbles being thrown

2642.88 --> 2648.08
being cast and then space-time bending

2645.44 --> 2649.359
moving it in just this perfect pattern

2648.08 --> 2650.16
[Music]

2649.359 --> 2653.359
that

2650.16 --> 2656.3999999999996
is absolutely an absurd idea that that

2653.359 --> 2659.119
could happen like by definition

2656.4 --> 2662.7200000000003
the heliocentric model is

2659.119 --> 2663.599
unstable it would have to be you know

2662.72 --> 2666.0789999999997
why

2663.599 --> 2668.6400000000003
because it came

2666.079 --> 2670.7200000000003
from nothing

2668.64 --> 2671.7599999999998
then changed

2670.72 --> 2673.52
into

2671.76 --> 2675.6800000000003
what it is now

2673.52 --> 2679.2
or if there is a change toward that then

2675.68 --> 2682.7999999999997
how could you ever expect there to

2679.2 --> 2682.7999999999997
be perfect balance

2684.48 --> 2690.079
i mean technically philosophically there

2687.44 --> 2693.68
can only be a perfect balance if it was

2690.079 --> 2693.6800000000003
always perfectly balanced

2694.72 --> 2699.5989999999997
if it had to naturally

2697.2 --> 2701.5989999999997
develop to that stage then there can

2699.599 --> 2705.4
never be a perfect balance because it

2701.599 --> 2705.4
wasn't perfect

2710.96 --> 2715.44
what is non-space that's

2713.68 --> 2718.7599999999998
that's the point that was my question

2715.44 --> 2718.76
danny flathead

2719.119 --> 2724.0
i talked about it yesterday on my show

2722.64 --> 2728.0789999999997
a lot

2724.0 --> 2728.079
it is in the title of yesterday's show

2731.28 --> 2733.8390000000004
oh [ __ ]

2738.96 --> 2744.68
okay tony white can take it easy

2741.359 --> 2744.68
that sucks

2751.52 --> 2757.92
hello anna main by the way

2754.96 --> 2757.92

2796.88 --> 2799.88
yes

2808.74 --> 2814.24
[Music]

2811.359 --> 2816.72
right but hey danny flathead uh did you

2814.24 --> 2819.68
watch yesterday's show

2816.72 --> 2823.0
or did you just come in here and like oh

2819.68 --> 2823.0
what's gnomespace

2823.84 --> 2827.03
[Music]

2842.64 --> 2847.2
no i didn't

2844.96 --> 2847.2
what

2847.359 --> 2850.319
no you didn't what

2850.64 --> 2854.4
i gave you two options

2855.359 --> 2858.52
to respond

2865.119 --> 2870.2400000000002
you didn't watch yesterday's all right

2867.44 --> 2873.92
well non-space

2870.24 --> 2876.5589999999997
is a concept that is part of a

2873.92 --> 2878.64
well of the rectangular looping

2876.559 --> 2880.8
earth setup although

2878.64 --> 2884.24
technically it could even exist without

2880.8 --> 2884.96
the loop being present

2884.24 --> 2887.04
but

2884.96 --> 2888.0
it is basically a

2887.04 --> 2890.72
pun

2888.0 --> 2892.96
intended fill-in

2890.72 --> 2892.9599999999996
for

2893.92 --> 2898.48
the yeah what would be outside of the

2896.88 --> 2901.2000000000003
containment

2898.48 --> 2903.92
right so even the domed people that are

2901.2 --> 2906.0
insist there's a dome that surrounds us

2903.92 --> 2908.8
well they might still be inclined to

2906.0 --> 2912.16
imagine that there is more space beyond

2908.8 --> 2913.52
the dome there's just more

2912.16 --> 2916.0789999999997
well i

2913.52 --> 2918.72
think that that is extremely unlikely i

2916.079 --> 2921.119
think that is because of

2918.72 --> 2924.319
fantasy and because of the training of

2921.119 --> 2926.1600000000003
outer space of just the idea of infinite

2924.319 --> 2927.52
rooms surrounding you

2926.16 --> 2929.2799999999997
that we're all

2927.52 --> 2932.4
kind of

2929.28 --> 2932.4
used to doing that

2933.76 --> 2938.7200000000003
i think that

2935.52 --> 2941.7599999999998
outside of the realm confines there is

2938.72 --> 2943.7599999999998
no room there is no more space

2941.76 --> 2946.1600000000003
in other words there's none space

2943.76 --> 2947.44
non-space would be

2946.16 --> 2949.5989999999997
a

2947.44 --> 2952.16
location

2949.599 --> 2954.319
yes the location is essential because

2952.16 --> 2954.319
the

2954.4 --> 2958.559
where

2955.68 --> 2960.7999999999997
material cannot move into

2958.559 --> 2962.48
in any form

2960.8 --> 2964.319
like it's it's like

2962.48 --> 2967.2
space that is per definition

2964.319 --> 2967.2
inaccessible

2967.28 --> 2972.559
so there it could be like

2969.28 --> 2974.2400000000002
let's say a pillar and in that pillar

2972.559 --> 2976.4
the pillar is not

2974.24 --> 2977.68
filled up with something

2976.4 --> 2981.359
it is

2977.68 --> 2984.48
an exclusion within available space for

2981.359 --> 2987.119
matter to move

2984.48 --> 2988.0
and that would be non-space non-space

2987.119 --> 2988.7200000000003
would

2988.0 --> 2990.96
to

2988.72 --> 2994.8799999999997
any observer within the material realm

2990.96 --> 2997.52
seem like the perfect solid material

2994.88 --> 2999.92
that is perfectly smooth and it is like

2997.52 --> 3002.319
indestructibly hard literally

2999.92 --> 3004.0
but it isn't because it is not a

3002.319 --> 3006.72
material

3004.0 --> 3009.2
it is actually the hundred percent lack

3006.72 --> 3009.9599999999996
of material

3009.2 --> 3012.96
and

3009.96 --> 3014.64
inaccessibility for material and that is

3012.96 --> 3018.88
what would

3014.64 --> 3018.8799999999997
give the impression of extreme hardness

3019.119 --> 3024.96
so non-space is different from fake

3021.2 --> 3027.5989999999997
space well you could argue

3024.96 --> 3028.8
although it's not literally so you could

3027.599 --> 3032.2400000000002
argue that

3028.8 --> 3033.28
non-space is the exact opposite of outer

3032.24 --> 3035.52
space

3033.28 --> 3038.48
it is the

3035.52 --> 3040.96
not be not volume available instead of

3038.48 --> 3043.28
all this volume available it is the

3040.96 --> 3046.0
specifically not

3043.28 --> 3048.48
available space

3046.0 --> 3050.88
it is the absolute cut-off where

3048.48 --> 3054.16
literally nothing could ever go nothing

3050.88 --> 3057.6800000000003
material could ever move

3054.16 --> 3057.68
into non-space

3064.24 --> 3068.24
perhaps we should just go there and

3066.16 --> 3070.72
check it out yeah for sure of course

3068.24 --> 3073.1189999999997
dude i wanna

3070.72 --> 3074.48
maybe if it's worth it at some point in

3073.119 --> 3076.079
my life

3074.48 --> 3079.2
interact with

3076.079 --> 3081.2000000000003
well what would be the barrier

3079.2 --> 3083.9199999999996
anywhere whether it's like the barrier

3081.2 --> 3088.0
on top which could potentially be

3083.92 --> 3090.079
non-space a flat non-space top

3088.0 --> 3092.319
or it could get weird it could get we

3090.079 --> 3094.319
could it could be the bottom of the very

3092.319 --> 3095.359
earth we're standing on if there is an

3094.319 --> 3098.72
upward

3095.359 --> 3100.16
vertical loop as well which i cannot

3098.72 --> 3101.04
exclude

3100.16 --> 3103.68
i mean

3101.04 --> 3105.839
almost like why not

3103.68 --> 3107.9199999999996
why wouldn't the designer do that if

3105.839 --> 3110.72
you're gonna be able to loop space then

3107.92 --> 3113.52
why not do it up down as well like the

3110.72 --> 3117.1189999999997
potential of what you could do with that

3113.52 --> 3117.119
is mind-blowing

3118.16 --> 3121.359
but

3119.28 --> 3124.3190000000004
it might simply not be so and then it

3121.359 --> 3127.119
would be a barrier of non-space also

3124.319 --> 3129.7599999999998
north and south

3127.119 --> 3131.28
it might loop

3129.76 --> 3134.079
north and south

3131.28 --> 3138.2400000000002
but it also might not loop it might be

3134.079 --> 3140.319
more land and then a non-space barrier

3138.24 --> 3142.9599999999996
and it might seem to any observer that

3140.319 --> 3146.88
could touch that if that's even possible

3142.96 --> 3149.28
without freezing to death instantly

3146.88 --> 3151.599
well maybe

3149.28 --> 3153.8390000000004
it would seem like this perfectly hard

3151.599 --> 3153.839
glass

3155.68 --> 3160.72
and i wonder if there yeah there should

3157.68 --> 3162.16
even be sound coming off it

3160.72 --> 3164.24
if you knock it

3162.16 --> 3167.1189999999997
even though it's literally not material

3164.24 --> 3169.7599999999998
that's resonating it would be

3167.119 --> 3171.76
kind of the sound of the air surrounding

3169.76 --> 3173.119
it there would still be sound coming

3171.76 --> 3176.88
from it but it

3173.119 --> 3180.7200000000003
it would seem like such it like

3176.88 --> 3182.96
perfectly absorbent super stone

3180.72 --> 3184.3999999999996
because it's not gonna sound like the

3182.96 --> 3186.2400000000002
thing that you're knocking on is not

3184.4 --> 3188.48
gonna vibrate only the air that is

3186.24 --> 3191.1189999999997
surrounding your hand

3188.48 --> 3192.2400000000002
would vibrate

3191.119 --> 3194.8
i don't know

3192.24 --> 3196.4799999999996
i've been thinking about it a lot

3194.8 --> 3198.559
way back it's just

3196.48 --> 3200.079
that only yesterday i really figured out

3198.559 --> 3202.559
like wait maybe you could call that

3200.079 --> 3205.119
non-space i tried to explain it before

3202.559 --> 3207.0400000000004
it's just the end of available volume

3205.119 --> 3208.7200000000003
like it's the end of space

3207.04 --> 3211.119
that's what i used to call it but

3208.72 --> 3213.7599999999998
non-space would be a more specific

3211.119 --> 3213.76
designate

3219.28 --> 3222.28
agedo

3232.24 --> 3238.0789999999997
oh okay thank you pjc net it it might be

3235.76 --> 3239.599
possible we'd have to first like bump

3238.079 --> 3241.76
into it though

3239.599 --> 3243.599
that's the thing right it is purely

3241.76 --> 3247.88
conceptual until

3243.599 --> 3247.88
it is actually encountered

3253.04 --> 3258.24
right but if the realm confine is a

3256.079 --> 3260.48
hundred percent looping like it would

3258.24 --> 3263.7599999999998
not just be east the west looping which

3260.48 --> 3266.2400000000002
is the biggest likelihood that it is

3263.76 --> 3269.119
also have to be north south and up and

3266.24 --> 3272.16
down and if that is the case then we

3269.119 --> 3276.0
might be literally trapped in a wormhole

3272.16 --> 3279.68
that has no edge of any kind that has no

3276.0 --> 3281.44
cutoff point and no need for non-space

3279.68 --> 3282.72
because everything would always be

3281.44 --> 3285.119
looping

3282.72 --> 3287.2
whatever you do you'd always just end up

3285.119 --> 3288.1600000000003
back in the same place whether you go up

3287.2 --> 3293.0789999999997
down

3288.16 --> 3293.0789999999997
north south east west it wouldn't matter

3295.7 --> 3298.85
[Music]

3313.839 --> 3318.96
conceptual imaginary yeah

3317.119 --> 3322.0
that's right

3318.96 --> 3324.0
as long as you actually encounter it

3322.0 --> 3326.16
it's going to be imaginary it's going to

3324.0 --> 3328.319
be a science fiction concept that's

3326.16 --> 3330.8799999999997
right

3328.319 --> 3333.88
that's how ideas and things are figured

3330.88 --> 3333.88
out

3345.73 --> 3350.479
[Music]

3354.799 --> 3358.96
but at least my concept

3357.359 --> 3361.119
has a

3358.96 --> 3362.96
viable nature

3361.119 --> 3366.1600000000003
of some kind

3362.96 --> 3370.0
it does not blatantly violate all the

3366.16 --> 3371.44
established laws of nature

3370.0 --> 3374.079
so

3371.44 --> 3377.28
my concept of non-space

3374.079 --> 3380.079
is certainly a lot less

3377.28 --> 3384.48
fantastical

3380.079 --> 3384.48
than outer space vacuum

3385.28 --> 3389.3190000000004
just for the record there

3392.319 --> 3395.319
hmm

3407.2 --> 3409.52
yeah

3409.599 --> 3413.6800000000003
boltzmann

3410.96 --> 3417.7200000000003
shield after watching doom

3413.68 --> 3417.72
and just be careful with lasers

3418.88 --> 3423.28
the whole dune stuff with like the

3421.04 --> 3425.7599999999998
lasers and the

3423.28 --> 3428.6400000000003
shields is so bizarre

3425.76 --> 3430.3190000000004
and surreal it's fat it's amazing it's

3428.64 --> 3431.7599999999998
like really weird

3430.319 --> 3434.0
i've never like

3431.76 --> 3435.92
saw any other type like science fiction

3434.0 --> 3440.0
franchise that had something like

3435.92 --> 3440.0
technologically stand out like that

3440.72 --> 3444.1189999999997
very interesting

3455.04 --> 3460.5589999999997
i don't by the way i don't know what a

3456.48 --> 3464.16
holtzman shield is borders boy

3460.559 --> 3464.1600000000003
i guess i'll have to google it

3466.25 --> 3469.839
[Music]

3467.52 --> 3473.079
looper shadow what does that have to do

3469.839 --> 3473.0789999999997
with anything

3486.839 --> 3495.52
okay so holtzmann is specifically a dune

3492.88 --> 3498.4
name it wasn't an actual effect that was

3495.52 --> 3499.92
adapted to dune it's like a holtzman was

3498.4 --> 3502.64
a

3499.92 --> 3505.6800000000003
within that universe like a scientist

3502.64 --> 3507.68
slash engineer that invented that shield

3505.68 --> 3508.799
okay i didn't even know it was called

3507.68 --> 3511.799
that

3508.799 --> 3511.799
huh

3523.839 --> 3526.88
right

3524.88 --> 3528.7200000000003
so shield allows slow moving objects to

3526.88 --> 3531.7200000000003
pass through so it's like a custard

3528.72 --> 3531.72
shield

3531.92 --> 3536.0
right

3534.0 --> 3539.76
it really is like a

3536.0 --> 3539.76
energy custard shield

3540.16 --> 3544.8799999999997
you could just smack it and like it's

3542.16 --> 3546.8799999999997
pretty sturdy but if you just sit on it

3544.88 --> 3548.5
you're gonna sink through it

3546.88 --> 3551.699
so it's like custard

3548.5 --> 3551.699
[Music]

3592.96 --> 3597.44
it's a shield that will let the virus

3595.44 --> 3601.0
you mean

3597.44 --> 3601.0
akuma virus

3601.2 --> 3605.359
yeah it's well it is a shield that you

3603.28 --> 3607.599
can just hug it and then you'll get

3605.359 --> 3607.5989999999997
through

3608.319 --> 3611.72
that yeah

3621.76 --> 3625.48
slow moving object

3626.25 --> 3632.799
[Music]

3628.88 --> 3632.799
doing is amazing yes it is indeed

3633.52 --> 3637.2
they did a pretty good job with the

3635.2 --> 3640.0789999999997
remake as well

3637.2 --> 3640.839
although it was a bit

3640.079 --> 3644.0
bit

3640.839 --> 3647.04
like maybe too gritty

3644.0 --> 3647.04
but it's like tough

3650.079 --> 3654.079
but i did like like the new

3651.82 --> 3656.96
[Music]

3654.079 --> 3659.28
the new model

3656.96 --> 3661.76
and it's just how they treated it

3659.28 --> 3664.2400000000002
i liked it

3661.76 --> 3667.3590000000004
it was interesting definitely looking

3664.24 --> 3671.839
forward to follow-up movies absolutely

3667.359 --> 3671.839
i mean they could be even better

3672.16 --> 3677.72
but they had the real thing going

3674.24 --> 3677.72
in there so

3692.48 --> 3696.559
the word virus they don't like

3694.72 --> 3699.7599999999998
they don't let the word virus through

3696.559 --> 3702.1600000000003
that is that is

3699.76 --> 3702.1600000000003
odd

3708.72 --> 3713.5989999999997
the hand in the box wasn't as good as

3710.48 --> 3714.64
the i agree definitely i liked it

3713.599 --> 3717.76
because

3714.64 --> 3720.8799999999997
in the original it's like you get to see

3717.76 --> 3721.76
what paul atreides imagines is in the

3720.88 --> 3724.4
box

3721.76 --> 3727.119
that was so much more scary

3724.4 --> 3729.44
i agree and not everything about it was

3727.119 --> 3733.039
superb it's just that like

3729.44 --> 3735.2000000000003
the designs and the ships and the style

3733.039 --> 3738.079
that was like oh

3735.2 --> 3740.64
this is great

3738.079 --> 3743.8390000000004
but like the scenes

3740.64 --> 3745.5989999999997
not all of it was like perfect

3743.839 --> 3748.24
it was just different it also had this

3745.599 --> 3750.079
feel look like oh we have to do it

3748.24 --> 3752.0789999999997
different

3750.079 --> 3755.8390000000004
no no you don't

3752.079 --> 3755.8390000000004
just have to do it perfect

3757.52 --> 3761.839
and yeah there's a lot of things that i

3759.28 --> 3764.079
still like from the original like i

3761.839 --> 3765.599
really like that

3764.079 --> 3767.52
what probably a lot of people think is

3765.599 --> 3770.2400000000002
very silly

3767.52 --> 3770.24
but like the

3771.359 --> 3777.2799999999997
the guilds

3773.68 --> 3779.68
uh that alien worm thing that like half

3777.28 --> 3781.599
human half worm

3779.68 --> 3783.44
that they just carried around in that

3781.599 --> 3784.4
giant tanker

3783.44 --> 3786.2400000000002
just

3784.4 --> 3790.96
it looked like

3786.24 --> 3793.1189999999997
yeah it was puppetry but it's still like

3790.96 --> 3795.76
just that they went there was so mind

3793.119 --> 3798.96
blowing it's like so surreal

3795.76 --> 3801.119
and i really appreciate just the style

3798.96 --> 3804.079
of the original dude and how far they

3801.119 --> 3806.319
would go with it i really appreciated

3804.079 --> 3806.319
that

3809.44 --> 3814.16
but yeah i i'd have to like re-watch the

3812.24 --> 3816.72
new doom movie

3814.16 --> 3818.5589999999997
i only like watched it one time the old

3816.72 --> 3819.359
one i've seen like

3818.559 --> 3822.92
10

3819.359 --> 3822.92
times or more

3831.119 --> 3835.119
right but yeah in the new doom movie

3833.44 --> 3838.4
they definitely

3835.119 --> 3840.1600000000003
emphasized even more how [ __ ] up like

3838.4 --> 3842.319
the harkonnen

3840.16 --> 3844.8799999999997
and the emperor the saddam car really

3842.319 --> 3846.96
are like

3844.88 --> 3849.76
because even in the original movie you

3846.96 --> 3853.039
had some super gross scenes and all that

3849.76 --> 3855.28
that was just like psychological

3853.039 --> 3857.76
nightmare type [ __ ]

3855.28 --> 3860.0
but beyond that

3857.76 --> 3862.48
they didn't like really show how

3860.0 --> 3865.119
gruesome everybody was

3862.48 --> 3868.0
and in the newer movie they like really

3865.119 --> 3870.6400000000003
show how [ __ ] up these people are

3868.0 --> 3873.68
with like living human sacrifices and

3870.64 --> 3876.4
all that [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] up

3873.68 --> 3879.2
so they definitely scooped more on top

3876.4 --> 3881.6800000000003
of it and that [ __ ] was in there like

3879.2 --> 3884.16
that is the dune universe it is that

3881.68 --> 3884.16
[ __ ] up

3889.44 --> 3892.44
right

3893.42 --> 3896.639
[Music]

3907.359 --> 3912.64
you could never get into dune

3910.48 --> 3915.839
well maybe the story or the characters

3912.64 --> 3918.16
just don't appeal a lot i mean i've only

3915.839 --> 3920.96
always had a very strong affinity with

3918.16 --> 3923.44
the paul atreides character like very

3920.96 --> 3925.52
strong affinity like with the story

3923.44 --> 3930.839
not necessarily even the figures that

3925.52 --> 3930.839
they put in the movies to represent him

3943.28 --> 3946.1600000000003
struggle with you intends to bore me a

3944.96 --> 3948.2400000000002
little

3946.16 --> 3951.839
right well yeah

3948.24 --> 3951.839
then you just don't get it

3954.4 --> 3958.799
i mean there's people that feel exactly

3956.48 --> 3963.52
like that about star wars it's just like

3958.799 --> 3967.68
yeah well it's kind of boring it's just

3963.52 --> 3967.68
right i don't think it's kind of boring

3970.48 --> 3974.72
but yeah i've come across other people

3972.24 --> 3976.9599999999996
that just were not super interested in

3974.72 --> 3976.9599999999996
doing

3977.68 --> 3980.3999999999996
in the past

3982.0 --> 3987.839
read the books for yeah

3984.24 --> 3992.68
well or the book the original book

3987.839 --> 3992.68
it's very good to actually read that

3992.96 --> 3999.68
i read part of it and then i just

3995.599 --> 3999.6800000000003
realized that i suck at book reading

4001.599 --> 4006.559
the only book i really ever read and

4004.16 --> 4008.319
just got through it all the way was like

4006.559 --> 4010.3190000000004
an extended version of the lord of the

4008.319 --> 4011.839
rings like extra fat

4010.319 --> 4013.92
version

4011.839 --> 4016.96
and i read it all the way and it's like

4013.92 --> 4018.559
the only book i ever succeeded in like

4016.96 --> 4019.28
really reading it all the way and not

4018.559 --> 4023.119
just

4019.28 --> 4023.119
like being getting sick of it

4034.0 --> 4038.48
it's like saving chocolate for a special

4036.319 --> 4042.44
occasion

4038.48 --> 4042.44
yeah you can see it like that

4055.28 --> 4058.92
hello m appeal

4083.52 --> 4086.52
hmm

4088.59 --> 4091.789

4116.799 --> 4119.839
fresh air here

4164.48 --> 4170.2789999999995

4166.4 --> 4170.2789999999995
dimensional shape

4175.34 --> 4178.529

4180.319 --> 4184.839000000001

not literally

4191.199 --> 4194.639999999999
that's almost like a philosophical

4193.12 --> 4196.32
question

4194.64 --> 4198.320000000001
ask a math yeah if you ask a

4196.32 --> 4201.12
mathematician they're going to be like

4198.32 --> 4203.36
yeah that's you just adam

4201.12 --> 4207.28
you just continuate the dimensionality

4203.36 --> 4208.4
and then just argue how that works and

4207.28 --> 4211.96
right

4208.4 --> 4211.96
but yeah

4221.52 --> 4226.400000000001
in physical reality

4223.76 --> 4226.400000000001
not really

4227.36 --> 4232.32
isn't the fourth dimension supposed to

4228.8 --> 4236.76
be that well only according to einstein

4232.32 --> 4236.759999999999
and that was just complete [ __ ]

4245.04 --> 4250.96
because time is not a spatial dimension

4249.28 --> 4254.32
has no

4250.96 --> 4257.32
place being among spatial dimensions at

4254.32 --> 4257.32
all

4259.12 --> 4265.64
because time is not spatial

4261.52 --> 4265.64
has nothing to do with it

4281.52 --> 4287.4800000000005
tesseract is a 4d shape

4284.48 --> 4287.48
really

4312.4 --> 4316.08
is that

4313.6 --> 4316.08
really

4319.28 --> 4323.92
okay

4320.88 --> 4326.2390000000005
well that just seems like a math concept

4323.92 --> 4326.2390000000005
then

4326.48 --> 4332.32
because

4329.04 --> 4334.56
it's still just kind of a cube in a cube

4332.32 --> 4336.0
really

4334.56 --> 4338.8
like that's not

4336.0 --> 4341.28
literally fourth dimensional it's like a

4338.8 --> 4343.76
how you represent the fourth dimension

4341.28 --> 4346.48
in the 3d you see

4343.76 --> 4347.6
because you can't actually do it again

4346.48 --> 4349.5599999999995
this is

4347.6 --> 4351.76
that's why i said it's like that

4349.56 --> 4353.679
mathematician [ __ ]

4351.76 --> 4356.0
and it's like oh look this is how you do

4353.679 --> 4358.32
it yeah but it's it's you're showing me

4356.0 --> 4360.56
something three-dimensional though it's

4358.32 --> 4364.4
not fourth dimensional you we're seeing

4360.56 --> 4364.400000000001
it in the three dimensions so

4365.84 --> 4371.1990000000005
it's like the tesseract is not literally

4368.56 --> 4374.0
fourth dimensional it's

4371.199 --> 4376.239
a concept

4374.0 --> 4380.48
it's mathematically

4376.239 --> 4382.639999999999
fourth dimensional not actually

4380.48 --> 4385.44
if i'd have to

4382.64 --> 4385.4400000000005
designate designated

4397.12 --> 4403.12
yeah look i've seen it before

4400.96 --> 4406.12
don't necessarily need to read all that

4403.12 --> 4406.12
again

4416.159 --> 4418.4
oh

4419.44 --> 4424.5199999999995
a tesseract is a four dimensional

4422.0 --> 4427.84
objects but we cannot

4424.52 --> 4427.84
observe that

4429.199 --> 4434.879999999999
so we can't craft it so a tesseract is

4432.4 --> 4436.239
then just a concept and the thing that

4434.88 --> 4439.1990000000005
they show

4436.239 --> 4441.759999999999
as a representation of it isn't actually

4439.199 --> 4444.48
the tesseract then

4441.76 --> 4446.96
so what we get to see then as

4444.48 --> 4449.678999999999
claimed to be a tesseract shape is

4446.96 --> 4454.44
actually a reification

4449.679 --> 4454.4400000000005
it's not actually a tesseract then

4457.199 --> 4462.28
it's just as i said a mathematical

4460.0 --> 4465.76
conception

4462.28 --> 4469.04
[Music]

4465.76 --> 4472.0
like it's about as four-dimensional

4469.04 --> 4474.32
as showing like balls

4472.0 --> 4475.679
moving over a sheet that's kind of

4474.32 --> 4476.639999999999
flexible

4475.679 --> 4478.96
is

4476.64 --> 4481.12
space-time bending right it's that

4478.96 --> 4482.4
comparisons like no it's actually

4481.12 --> 4484.5599999999995
something in

4482.4 --> 4485.5199999999995
3d you're showing me

4484.56 --> 4487.6
and it

4485.52 --> 4490.2390000000005
it doesn't actually

4487.6 --> 4492.08
demonstrate actual gravity time space

4490.239 --> 4494.5599999999995
bending at all

4492.08 --> 4497.679
but you're trying to make us think of it

4494.56 --> 4500.56
like that well the same goes for the

4497.679 --> 4503.76
tesseract shape when you google it like

4500.56 --> 4507.52
that's not actually fourth dimensional

4503.76 --> 4509.12
it's just suggested to be that based on

4507.52 --> 4511.84
mathematical

4509.12 --> 4511.84
philosophy

4512.88 --> 4516.719
just like the

4514.4 --> 4520.32
gravity space-time bending of balls on a

4516.719 --> 4524.96
flexible sheet isn't actually a visual

4520.32 --> 4527.5199999999995
representation of space-time bending

4524.96 --> 4527.52
understand

4534.719 --> 4540.2390000000005
or you could say like gorzilla it's as

4537.12 --> 4544.36
fourth dimensional as a unicorn

4540.239 --> 4544.36
you could say it like that too

4569.04 --> 4572.28
the hell

4589.76 --> 4595.04
he wouldn't be able to fully demonstrate

4593.28 --> 4598.48
three yeah but look

4595.04 --> 4600.88
you can to some degree

4598.48 --> 4604.36
the thing is you can actually make a 3d

4600.88 --> 4604.36
shape like that

4608.0 --> 4613.199
like with you can

4610.64 --> 4615.76
visually represent three-dimensional

4613.199 --> 4617.839999999999
things on a two-dimensional

4615.76 --> 4619.84
plane

4617.84 --> 4622.4800000000005
it's a screen it's a picture it's a

4619.84 --> 4625.76
drawing it's a painting

4622.48 --> 4629.839999999999
you can represent it visually

4625.76 --> 4632.64
that doesn't make it 3d but it looks 3d

4629.84 --> 4636.159000000001
and arguably you could make an object

4632.64 --> 4639.84
that looks exactly like that is then 3d

4636.159 --> 4642.159
what it isn't however is literally 4d

4639.84 --> 4645.6
so yeah you can

4642.159 --> 4648.799999999999
make a drawing that is 2d

4645.6 --> 4652.96
of a 3d object

4648.8 --> 4655.679
that is trying to represent a fourth

4652.96 --> 4659.12
dimensional object

4655.679 --> 4661.6
which it technically wouldn't be

4659.12 --> 4663.199
yeah you can do that it's not confusing

4661.6 --> 4665.84
at all when you put it like that it

4663.199 --> 4665.839999999999
right

4675.72 --> 4681.08
[Music]

4678.08 --> 4681.08
uh

4684.16 --> 4687.2789999999995
[Music]

4710.56 --> 4713.4400000000005
yeah

4711.76 --> 4715.679
yeah terry yeah

4713.44 --> 4718.08
the interstellar scene it is super

4715.679 --> 4721.04
fascinating i loved it

4718.08 --> 4723.12
it was a great attempt to try to show

4721.04 --> 4725.44
something fourth dimensional

4723.12 --> 4725.44
great

4731.28 --> 4738.0
fear like oculus can make appearances of

4733.6 --> 4738.0
3d using 2d screens yeah

4738.08 --> 4742.0
as i said you can actually represent to

4741.28 --> 4742.88
the

4742.0 --> 4745.12
like

4742.88 --> 4747.36
three-dimensional objects

4745.12 --> 4749.12
on a two-dimensional sheet it's called

4747.36 --> 4751.199
drawing things

4749.12 --> 4754.48
you can't do that

4751.199 --> 4757.839999999999
but it's only visually

4754.48 --> 4760.48
3d then you see it's only to the mind

4757.84 --> 4763.12
that can interpret it

4760.48 --> 4764.799999999999
like it is 3d and that's how you

4763.12 --> 4766.64
understand what you're then looking at

4764.8 --> 4768.2390000000005
what it is representing it's not

4766.64 --> 4770.88
literally 3d

4768.239 --> 4772.799999999999
if you just draw it

4770.88 --> 4775.1990000000005
so it's only

4772.8 --> 4776.96
it requires the information from the

4775.199 --> 4781.12
brain

4776.96 --> 4781.12
because it is not literally 3d

4783.12 --> 4788.12
you have to visually translate it as

4785.12 --> 4788.12
such

4790.0 --> 4794.8
all right and same goes for oculus vr

4800.32 --> 4804.639999999999
thanks for that godzilla

4802.48 --> 4805.589999999999
i'm

4804.64 --> 4807.4400000000005
i'm flat

4805.59 --> 4809.28
[Music]

4807.44 --> 4812.638999999999
well it's just

4809.28 --> 4814.639
a two-way process right i'm actually 3d

4812.639 --> 4817.92
but then there's a camera watching at me

4814.639 --> 4822.0
it's translating what it's picking up

4817.92 --> 4825.04
into a 2d image then sending it on

4822.0 --> 4828.08
over the internet to your screen

4825.04 --> 4830.239
as a 2d image where your brain

4828.08 --> 4833.84
can then look at it and interpret it as

4830.239 --> 4833.839999999999
the 3d image

4835.44 --> 4839.759999999999
but i tr i promise you i am actually a

4838.4 --> 4841.44
3d

4839.76 --> 4843.76
person

4841.44 --> 4843.759999999999
really

4846.0 --> 4851.92
okay there is going to be an fvd live

4848.639 --> 4851.92
show today could just know

4858.719 --> 4862.56
what if we had three eyes

4861.6 --> 4865.04
uh

4862.56 --> 4865.04
nothing

4865.12 --> 4871.199
you would have three eyes

4868.159 --> 4875.36
i mean spiders have eight eyes

4871.199 --> 4877.678999999999
flies have like a giant honeycomb eye

4875.36 --> 4879.5199999999995
right it doesn't matter how many eyes

4877.679 --> 4881.36
you have as to what type of things

4879.52 --> 4884.320000000001
you're going to see

4881.36 --> 4887.04
it is the brain the intermittent

4884.32 --> 4888.88
brain the intermediate and intermittent

4887.04 --> 4890.56
it's weird how i mix up those words but

4888.88 --> 4893.04
they both apply

4890.56 --> 4896.2390000000005
intermediate brain part

4893.04 --> 4898.4
makes the input from the visual mediums

4896.239 --> 4900.839999999999
the eyes into

4898.4 --> 4903.44
a combined 3d

4900.84 --> 4906.719
interpretation now if you have more than

4903.44 --> 4908.159
two eyes it's just gonna use the extra

4906.719 --> 4911.52
data

4908.159 --> 4911.5199999999995
and throw it on top

4912.4 --> 4916.879999999999
right so you could have three eyes it's

4914.48 --> 4918.959999999999
still gonna form a 3d image in your mind

4916.88 --> 4921.12
through the intermediate

4918.96 --> 4922.96
brain part that does that

4921.12 --> 4926.44
and that's also the cause of physicality

4922.96 --> 4926.44
assumption bias

4934.719 --> 4940.88
that's right akuma virus

4936.96 --> 4943.44
is the brain the intermediate brain part

4940.88 --> 4946.56
the translator that actually makes it

4943.44 --> 4948.879999999999
into 3d in your mind

4946.56 --> 4951.120000000001
because you're technically just having

4948.88 --> 4951.12
two

4952.08 --> 4955.28
flat

4953.6 --> 4959.76
pieces of data

4955.28 --> 4961.759999999999
that is being received by the eyes

4959.76 --> 4964.96
flat pieces of data

4961.76 --> 4967.360000000001
flat sheets of color and light

4964.96 --> 4969.76
derived from a three-dimensional realm

4967.36 --> 4972.4
through the eye lens

4969.76 --> 4974.4800000000005
and then the brain translates that 2d

4972.4 --> 4978.08
data

4974.48 --> 4981.08
into a 3d image again through structural

4978.08 --> 4981.08
interpretation

4996.08 --> 5002.239
right that's also like one

4998.48 --> 5004.08
why you can like stare at an object

5002.239 --> 5005.28
kind of like staring to the distance

5004.08 --> 5008.719
right you might

5005.28 --> 5011.04
like uncross your eyes slightly

5008.719 --> 5013.6
and then suddenly

5011.04 --> 5016.4
your brain that would normally like help

5013.6 --> 5018.0
you size up and solidify in your mind

5016.4 --> 5019.199
shapes that you're seeing

5018.0 --> 5021.12
will just

5019.199 --> 5022.719
not do that and everything just becomes

5021.12 --> 5023.84
like a blur

5022.719 --> 5025.84
soup

5023.84 --> 5028.0
it every all the colors just kind of

5025.84 --> 5031.76
start to bleed and it just becomes like

5028.0 --> 5033.76
this 2d sheet in your mind

5031.76 --> 5036.4800000000005
with with like paint on have you ever

5033.76 --> 5038.159000000001
had that like as you're staring and then

5036.48 --> 5041.959999999999
you're like not letting your

5038.159 --> 5041.96
intermediate process

5042.32 --> 5047.5199999999995
do the building in 3d you don't allow it

5045.28 --> 5049.36
to focus but you still look have you

5047.52 --> 5051.280000000001
ever done that if you ever succeeded

5049.36 --> 5055.32
just staring at something and then

5051.28 --> 5055.32
letting it become a soup

5058.159 --> 5061.759999999999
it's really funny how that works

5062.0 --> 5067.84
sounds like demon what the [ __ ]

5065.36 --> 5069.5199999999995
no no akuma virus

5067.84 --> 5071.6
it's a natural function you can

5069.52 --> 5074.2390000000005
literally if you focus

5071.6 --> 5077.92
turn it like just like you rick you can

5074.239 --> 5079.919999999999
like amplify that part of your brain

5077.92 --> 5082.88
the translation part

5079.92 --> 5086.08
of the information visual into 3d you

5082.88 --> 5088.159000000001
can focus and like sharpen it right and

5086.08 --> 5090.4
then suddenly everything becomes crystal

5088.159 --> 5092.08
clear immediately you know every corner

5090.4 --> 5093.28
everywhere right

5092.08 --> 5096.239
well

5093.28 --> 5098.48
if you realize that you can get a feel

5096.239 --> 5102.32
for that you can technically

5098.48 --> 5105.759999999999
do the opposite thing and specifically

5102.32 --> 5107.44
not do that like unfocus literally

5105.76 --> 5108.96
and focus

5107.44 --> 5111.28
and then

5108.96 --> 5113.6
your brain doesn't start to like

5111.28 --> 5115.12
emphasize oh this is the exact 3d shape

5113.6 --> 5118.719
of what you're looking at but instead it

5115.12 --> 5121.599999999999
just makes it into a giant soup

5118.719 --> 5124.96
that does not require any type of drugs

5121.6 --> 5124.96
or [ __ ] influence

5125.04 --> 5131.08
you can just train it through focus and

5128.08 --> 5131.08
unfocus

5144.639 --> 5149.04
are there different dimensions in sound

5149.28 --> 5151.44
no

5153.6 --> 5157.4400000000005
all sound is 3d

5157.679 --> 5162.08
but there are

5159.36 --> 5164.159
look sound is so incredible for like

5162.08 --> 5166.84
instinct and all that that there's just

5164.159 --> 5171.04
other intermediate brain

5166.84 --> 5171.04
processes that deal with that

5173.36 --> 5178.679
i don't want to address that right now

5174.8 --> 5178.679
it's much harder to explain

5213.28 --> 5216.5199999999995
hey lsg

5250.4 --> 5253.4
right

5253.92 --> 5260.159
so yeah guys i really hope you

5255.84 --> 5260.159000000001
appreciate what i do here online

5261.12 --> 5264.48
i think i'm doing pretty good i mean

5262.8 --> 5268.719
like

5264.48 --> 5268.718999999999
heat dying down certainly does help me

5269.36 --> 5277.32
but uh yeah i i really need support guys

5272.8 --> 5277.320000000001
i mean what the hell is going on

5289.6 --> 5293.52
yeah

5291.44 --> 5296.0
of course jedoz

5293.52 --> 5297.76
is giving me a bank transfer but i don't

5296.0 --> 5300.639
even know if that's gonna succeed like

5297.76 --> 5303.92
who knows like this might take months i

5300.639 --> 5306.159000000001
have no idea why it's taking forever

5303.92 --> 5309.04
it might literally not arrive at some

5306.159 --> 5311.599999999999
point which would be a huge bummer

5309.04 --> 5313.84
of course also for a jedi

5311.6 --> 5313.84
but

5315.84 --> 5319.52
yeah

5316.88 --> 5321.679
in the meantime i still kind of need

5319.52 --> 5323.360000000001
support to get around

5321.679 --> 5327.28
or i'm just gonna

5323.36 --> 5327.28
run into bankruptcy again

5329.28 --> 5335.5599999999995
and i really like to just

5331.52 --> 5335.56
eat and all that

5346.639 --> 5352.0
oh red zone right now okay yeah well

5350.0 --> 5354.08
yeah

5352.0 --> 5356.48
i was figuring it is probably that

5354.08 --> 5359.04
everybody is just financially kind of

5356.48 --> 5359.04
suffering

5363.28 --> 5368.88
but yeah so am i

5366.48 --> 5371.04
i just have to ask i don't like to ask i

5368.88 --> 5373.76
just don't like to

5371.04 --> 5375.76
become bankrupt

5373.76 --> 5379.84
so i just have to

5375.76 --> 5379.84
but yeah whenever you can

5385.84 --> 5388.88
right i mean

5389.44 --> 5393.678999999999
it's not hard

5391.76 --> 5394.56
especially through paypal it's really

5393.679 --> 5397.679
easy

5394.56 --> 5402.1990000000005
it arrives very quickly i get most of it

5397.679 --> 5402.1990000000005
or arguably all of it

5406.88 --> 5409.1990000000005
what

5412.8 --> 5415.6
oh great

5416.239 --> 5419.718999999999

let's get back to conversation still got

5441.04 --> 5444.08
20 minutes to go

5447.92 --> 5452.4800000000005
things today

5449.12 --> 5452.48

5461.199 --> 5466.839999999999

okay

5483.04 --> 5487.679

5484.8 --> 5488.96
stuck in in somebody else's debt spiral

5487.679 --> 5491.84

5488.96 --> 5491.84
be careful

5496.56 --> 5500.080000000001

5498.88 --> 5502.4800000000005

5500.08 --> 5505.5199999999995
which the guy are you talking about

5502.48 --> 5508.799999999999
there's been many the guys

5505.52 --> 5508.8

5511.76 --> 5514.95
but

5512.48 --> 5518.5199999999995

5537.199 --> 5540.5599999999995
can't think of it right now

5544.4 --> 5548.32

5546.08 --> 5550.5599999999995
he kind of dropped off youtube and all

5548.32 --> 5550.5599999999995

5572.639 --> 5578.639
somebody else i mean there's new people

5574.88 --> 5578.639
arriving on the scene doing stuff

5585.12 --> 5589.599999999999
and when it comes to like flat smacking

5587.04 --> 5591.679
students well dell from the imaginary

5589.6 --> 5593.04
curve also does go around in this

5591.679 --> 5596.0
country

5593.04 --> 5599.04
doing that talking to like students

5596.0 --> 5602.28
in like in their 20s

5599.04 --> 5602.28

5610.4 --> 5615.44
the last time he like kind of really

5612.48 --> 5617.759999999999
humiliated himself and then just acted

5615.44 --> 5621.599999999999
like a complete [ __ ]

5617.76 --> 5621.6
and after that he just retreated

5621.84 --> 5626.2390000000005
uh

5623.92 --> 5630.1990000000005

conceptualization

5778.239 --> 5784.718999999999
logic based trainer thinking

5781.679 --> 5787.119
critical thinking

5784.719 --> 5790.4800000000005
especially when it comes to

5787.119 --> 5793.679
shapes and the shape of the realm

5790.48 --> 5797.959999999999
and the possibilities of the design

5821.76 --> 5827.04
questions i can do exactly what i can do

5824.159 --> 5829.839999999999
here now if you're just a piece of [ __ ]

5827.04 --> 5831.119
[ __ ] that wants to just make fun of

5829.84 --> 5832.719
somebody

5831.119 --> 5835.119
because i don't

5832.719 --> 5838.159
follow your specific

5835.119 --> 5840.5599999999995
value chart of cocking and being a

5838.159 --> 5843.44
[ __ ] scumbag demon

5840.56 --> 5846.080000000001
yeah then i don't give a [ __ ]

5843.44 --> 5846.08
about you

5846.32 --> 5854.0
anybody that actually is up for inquiry

5850.56 --> 5856.2390000000005
wants to know like really serious [ __ ]

5854.0 --> 5859.119
like the questions that you normally

5856.239 --> 5861.04
don't even ask other people because

5859.119 --> 5864.159
they're probably not going to get it and

5861.04 --> 5866.84
just be laughy about it right you have a

5864.159 --> 5870.32
really [ __ ] serious question that's

5866.84 --> 5872.719
extremely heavy weighted to you you can

5870.32 --> 5875.5199999999995
ask me that and i will answer it very

5872.719 --> 5878.159
seriously if you're just a troll scumbag

5875.52 --> 5880.159000000001
however i will instantly be able to

5878.159 --> 5882.96
figure that out

5880.159 --> 5885.44
and then i will not answer your question

5882.96 --> 5887.92
you can't hide your true intentions from

5885.44 --> 5890.799999999999
me you see

5887.92 --> 5892.8
unless i get distracted in a moment

5890.8 --> 5895.4400000000005
then even then

5892.8 --> 5896.96
after just mere seconds i will catch up

5895.44 --> 5900.159
on that

5896.96 --> 5900.159
can't fool me for long

5902.159 --> 5905.28
you find it harder to talk in dutch

5903.76 --> 5907.4400000000005
about this subject

5905.28 --> 5911.199
well i haven't had a lot of training

5907.44 --> 5914.239
jarvis but actually once i get into it i

5911.199 --> 5916.48
am a lot better you know why

5914.239 --> 5917.44
because

5916.48 --> 5920.638999999999
talking

5917.44 --> 5922.32
dutch at a high standard is really

5920.639 --> 5924.56
difficult

5922.32 --> 5927.759999999999
like that's really

5924.56 --> 5930.4800000000005
[ __ ] difficult to do that

5927.76 --> 5934.0
being actual like high level dutch

5930.48 --> 5935.678999999999
speaker is is rare

5934.0 --> 5938.48
that's rare

5935.679 --> 5940.8
and i can do that i was trained by my

5938.48 --> 5944.239
parents to do that

5940.8 --> 5946.159000000001
like adamantly always always every

5944.239 --> 5948.799999999999
[ __ ] second

5946.159 --> 5951.599999999999
every time i said something slightly off

5948.8 --> 5954.2390000000005
slightly lazy they like immediately tell

5951.6 --> 5955.84
me no this is how you say it

5954.239 --> 5957.678999999999
they've done that like

5955.84 --> 5959.679
my entire team

5957.679 --> 5962.96
times and preaching

5959.679 --> 5965.1990000000005
so yeah i can talk

5962.96 --> 5967.04
i can talk it i can say these things in

5965.199 --> 5969.36
english and i will

5967.04 --> 5971.84
definitely be able to

5969.36 --> 5974.4
say it in a way that people can't just

5971.84 --> 5976.96
steamroll it with their retardation like

5974.4 --> 5980.879999999999
these pieces of [ __ ] here in chat that

5976.96 --> 5983.119
keeps sock popping up

5980.88 --> 5986.639
trying to guess like me like i'm not

5983.119 --> 5987.599999999999
smart because my iq is probably double

5986.639 --> 5988.96
theirs

5987.6 --> 5990.96
they're just too

5988.96 --> 5993.679
[ __ ] stupid

5990.96 --> 5996.0
to admit it to themselves that they are

5993.679 --> 5997.679
unbelievable [ __ ] retards that

5996.0 --> 5999.6
everybody hates

5997.679 --> 6001.92

6096.88 --> 6100.400000000001
because that certain type of pants

6099.52 --> 6103.1990000000005
[ __ ]

6100.4 --> 6105.599999999999
stink is doesn't rub off easily in the

6103.199 --> 6108.239
wash so you're gonna be reminded about

6105.6 --> 6110.96
your [ __ ] humiliation you hear me

6108.239 --> 6110.959999999999
scumbag

6114.96 --> 6119.92
so yeah

6116.96 --> 6121.04
i do presentations at universities and

6119.92 --> 6123.52
schools

6121.04 --> 6123.5199999999995
why not

6124.639 --> 6130.32
you see i'm not afraid of stupid little

6128.0 --> 6132.0
snot noses that think they're better

6130.32 --> 6133.92
than everybody

6132.0 --> 6138.0
i'm not afraid of them and i'm not

6133.92 --> 6140.08
afraid to humiliate them monstrously for

6138.0 --> 6142.48
the retardation that they display in

6140.08 --> 6142.48
public

6151.2 --> 6156.8
[Music]

6154.0 --> 6161.0
shut up matthew hole

6156.8 --> 6161.0
yeah you're right dammit

6164.48 --> 6167.718999999999
i know

6172.31 --> 6177.1990000000005
[Music]

6191.52 --> 6196.2390000000005
all right anyway i'm gonna take

6194.48 --> 6198.48
two minute break and i'll be right back

6196.239 --> 6199.28
and then i'm gonna run out of the show

6198.48 --> 6200.799999999999
ben

6199.28 --> 6202.96
there's sock accounts you have my full

6200.8 --> 6204.639
permission tarot m appeal matthew hall

6202.96 --> 6207.04
to ban

6204.639 --> 6210.92
this [ __ ] with his soccer card that

6207.04 --> 6210.92
is gonna pop up again

6308.48 --> 6313.0
yeah probably tear it

6317.6 --> 6320.6
ugh

6346.56 --> 6348.88
yeah

6348.96 --> 6354.56
but yeah if

6352.0 --> 6357.119
some [ __ ] like this troll would be in

6354.56 --> 6360.4800000000005
a class where i would do my thing

6357.119 --> 6362.08
i would slap them in the face probably

6360.48 --> 6365.28
not bash them it wouldn't be worth it

6362.08 --> 6370.0
but it would definitely [ __ ] slap them

6365.28 --> 6372.8
like very audibly like with a wide sweep

6370.0 --> 6375.119
so that like everybody's attention is

6372.8 --> 6377.76
very specifically drawn to that moment

6375.119 --> 6381.199
of humiliation

6377.76 --> 6381.1990000000005
that that person deserves

6381.52 --> 6386.159000000001
i was looking forward to that happening

6383.6 --> 6388.8
at some point

6386.159 --> 6392.08
i mean like

6388.8 --> 6392.08
but we have satellite

6393.84 --> 6397.400000000001
that would be great

6408.39 --> 6411.52
[Music]

6409.6 --> 6413.119000000001
he would have to say more shitty things

6411.52 --> 6415.679
than just we have satellites though

6413.119 --> 6418.5599999999995
before i slap him in the face but

6415.679 --> 6418.56
you know what i mean

6426.8 --> 6433.360000000001
okay well tara 306 you're a student so

6430.0 --> 6433.36
that would be different though

6434.96 --> 6439.84
i mean there is a chance though that if

6436.639 --> 6442.8
i'm gonna be a speaker at a school

6439.84 --> 6445.4400000000005
and that some whiny little gamma global

6442.8 --> 6447.92
[ __ ] is gonna just ruin my

6445.44 --> 6449.5199999999995
my speech and then if i then slap him in

6447.92 --> 6451.04
the face in front of everybody there is

6449.52 --> 6454.159000000001
a chance that they probably wouldn't

6451.04 --> 6456.88
invite me back though

6454.159 --> 6459.5199999999995
or they'd be like yes please come back

6456.88 --> 6462.639
we hate that piece of [ __ ]

6459.52 --> 6465.679
it could be that too

6462.639 --> 6465.679
you never really know

6466.159 --> 6471.3099999999995
yeah i'm not gonna slap a tutor of

6467.76 --> 6473.679
course not that's ridiculous

6471.31 --> 6475.76
[Music]

6473.679 --> 6477.52
is the school going to invite you never

6475.76 --> 6480.0
know

6477.52 --> 6482.0
i mean there is more interest in flat

6480.0 --> 6484.8
earth and

6482.0 --> 6486.239
alternative ideas a lot of it

6484.8 --> 6489.28
so

6486.239 --> 6489.28
you never really know

6490.159 --> 6493.679
i think it's possible that at some point

6492.32 --> 6496.719
they

6493.679 --> 6496.719
might just do it

6497.6 --> 6499.84
i mean

6501.679 --> 6507.6
i'm all together really not that

6504.639 --> 6510.2390000000005
insane not that crazy compared to what

6507.6 --> 6513.04
else is going on out there i think i am

6510.239 --> 6515.839999999999
a little eccentric by standards

6513.04 --> 6517.119
by universal standards

6515.84 --> 6519.52
but

6517.119 --> 6522.0
at least i'm cohesive and i'm not a

6519.52 --> 6524.320000000001
freaking blabbermouth that just makes up

6522.0 --> 6528.0
random [ __ ] and then doesn't think about

6524.32 --> 6528.0
the consequences of saying it

6531.28 --> 6537.44
i actually do think about that i take my

6534.08 --> 6540.4
own words very serious

6537.44 --> 6542.879999999999
and i think over time there will be more

6540.4 --> 6544.239
appreciation for that

6542.88 --> 6547.28
and hey

6544.239 --> 6549.28
i've been going for years seven years at

6547.28 --> 6551.199
some point it's just going to be like oh

6549.28 --> 6552.8
yeah that guy yeah of course he's still

6551.199 --> 6553.759999999999
going

6552.8 --> 6555.76
and

6553.76 --> 6557.92
they might be like hey

6555.76 --> 6559.52
no they might just start inviting me to

6557.92 --> 6561.36
ask like hey what is it like to have a

6559.52 --> 6563.92
daily show

6561.36 --> 6565.04
just for that

6563.92 --> 6569.32
fine

6565.04 --> 6569.32
i'll talk about it why not

6570.4 --> 6575.44
thank you for the moderating by the way

6572.8 --> 6575.4400000000005
at least g

6575.599 --> 6578.599
h

6587.44 --> 6589.759999999999
hmm

6592.639 --> 6597.76
okay that's cool jedi

6595.679 --> 6601.1990000000005
yeah that is very interesting

6597.76 --> 6601.1990000000005
i like schools that do that

6601.92 --> 6606.56
i think that conspiracy theory day is

6604.08 --> 6609.36
actually would be a very good general

6606.56 --> 6611.360000000001
concept to have at schools

6609.36 --> 6613.679
because everybody's going to be dealing

6611.36 --> 6615.28
with conspiracy theories one way or the

6613.679 --> 6617.84
other

6615.28 --> 6620.08
through grassroots the conspiracy nutty

6617.84 --> 6621.84
people

6620.08 --> 6623.599
genuine conspiracies of course and

6621.84 --> 6626.400000000001
through politics so

6623.599 --> 6630.56
conspiracy theory day sounds like a

6626.4 --> 6630.5599999999995
really good concept to have in a school

6630.96 --> 6635.119
right anyway i'm gonna round out the
