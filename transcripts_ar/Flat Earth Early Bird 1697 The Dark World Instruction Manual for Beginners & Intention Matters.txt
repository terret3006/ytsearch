531.4 --> 538.68
[Music]

534.399 --> 540.6
long oh wait not just long it was just

538.68 --> 543.88
long

540.6 --> 543.88

later not sure did flat soid go live

551.279 --> 555.16
too I I missed that

558.519 --> 563.24
part did he really go on with Mr

564.36 --> 570.8000000000001
sensible I'm not sure I missed flat soid

567.6 --> 572.36
yesterday but uh

570.8 --> 576.519
what I did not

572.36 --> 579.32
miss was Owen Benjamin having Dr Shiva

576.519 --> 582.519
on that was

579.32 --> 585.1600000000001
amazing and like I love it because I

582.519 --> 588.12
could basically listen through D life

585.16 --> 588.12
which has better sound

588.44 --> 594.1600000000001
quality from Owen Benjamin's side and

590.92 --> 597.4399999999999
then just comment within Dr shiva's jet

594.16 --> 601.12
so that was great had a lot of fun and

597.44 --> 601.12
very very interesting

601.279 --> 605.769
very

602.72 --> 605.769
[Music]

606.44 --> 613.6
interesting they made quite a

608.72 --> 613.6
team uh yeah I know I saw you there

623.68 --> 632.64
too right

626.12 --> 632.64
and yeah also qwi kwi went live

632.72 --> 637.399
again I mean no ball busters but we're

635.36 --> 638.839
getting a treatment session every

637.399 --> 640.68
freaking day

638.839 --> 642.9590000000001
now

640.68 --> 646.519
okay but yeah he's still working on

642.959 --> 649.56
Jaren and uh I mean it's very tough to

646.519 --> 649.5600000000001
get through I totally get

653.69 --> 656.839
[Music]

658.04 --> 661.04
it

662.8 --> 670.3199999999999
maybe no

665.079 --> 673.1999999999999
tet it's to dude stop thinking like that

670.32 --> 675.44
please it's not [ __ ] relevant like

673.2 --> 677.88
why the hell would Dr Shiva get involved

675.44 --> 680.399
in anything like

677.88 --> 682.76
that like why would he start to

680.399 --> 686.32
formulate an opinion about that other

682.76 --> 689.88
than to completely [ __ ] himself

686.32 --> 693.399
up yeah because that just immediately

689.88 --> 695.12
make any potential chance for him to

693.399 --> 698.04
become president with the stance he

695.12 --> 699.839
takes immediately off the map it would

698.04 --> 704.56
be the dumbest [ __ ] thing he could

699.839 --> 706.9200000000001
ever do even though he quite assuredly

704.56 --> 709.92
knows the Earth is

706.92 --> 709.92
flat

711.8 --> 716.92
yeah yeah

713.92 --> 719.24
so of course he isn't going to start

716.92 --> 720.959
talking about Flat Earth but he doesn't

719.24 --> 723.9590000000001
like shame flat earthers and he lets

720.959 --> 727.5189999999999
flat earthers talk in his chat all he

723.959 --> 730.279
likes like all they like I I say flat

727.519 --> 734.68
other people say he's fine with it right

730.279 --> 737.32
so that's good enough and better even I

734.68 --> 738.56
mean you don't want Dr Shiva talking

737.32 --> 742.48
about Flat

738.56 --> 745.76
Earth because he can just say goodbye to

742.48 --> 745.76
his presidential run

745.8 --> 752.4799999999999
then not because it's not true but

748.44 --> 754.9590000000001
because it triggers too many people and

752.48 --> 759.04
then they'll all run straight into the

754.959 --> 762.959
[ __ ] hands of Bobby effing Kennedy

759.04 --> 765.8389999999999
and Trump and all that right because

762.959 --> 767.56
well if a flat earther says that then it

765.839 --> 769.9590000000001
must be the opposite because that's how

767.56 --> 771.88
[ __ ] Americans have been

769.959 --> 774.76
programmed so

771.88 --> 777.32
that's what he's not going to do because

774.76 --> 777.3199999999999
he's not an

777.839 --> 780.839
idiot

791.0 --> 795.16
a true pres yeah a true president would

794.0 --> 799.279
get

795.16 --> 802.88
elected yeah a true president would be

799.279 --> 805.4399999999999
elected yeah a true president does not

802.88 --> 808.32
blabber his mouth off to be like the

805.44 --> 811.48
purest of pure and then alienate himself

808.32 --> 814.24
from the [ __ ] idiots that are meant

811.48 --> 816.8000000000001
to vote on them so they never do become

814.24 --> 816.8
president

816.88 --> 824.24
yeah don't be so freaking shortsighted

819.839 --> 824.24
about that please it's

826.399 --> 832.16
embarrassing yeah and hey if he does

830.0 --> 835.079
become president I'm sure that at its

832.16 --> 837.759
second term he will probably just say

835.079 --> 841.3599999999999
okay I'm going to close NASA now or

837.759 --> 843.04
something yeah he can't [ __ ] do that

841.36 --> 846.639
in his

843.04 --> 846.639
campaign use a

856.519 --> 859.519
brain

861.6 --> 867.759
right okay

863.44 --> 869.9200000000001
fine but yeah he is very cool he

867.759 --> 871.92
understands a lot and that is like

869.92 --> 876.24
really

871.92 --> 879.079
great uh yeah yeah that that's not going

876.24 --> 882.92
to stand in my chat

879.079 --> 882.92
tomonoid absolutely

897.68 --> 900.68
idiotic

908.92 --> 914.12
just what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

910.6 --> 914.12
Tomo why the hell would you say

927.6 --> 930.6
that

955.68 --> 962.3599999999999
no I think that if Dr Shiva becomes Pres

958.759 --> 965.759
president he would be much much better

962.36 --> 965.759
than any of you can

966.839 --> 974.399
imagine cuz he is a guy that will

970.839 --> 974.399
absolutely change

974.839 --> 980.3190000000001
things against all the players all all

978.199 --> 980.319
of

983.0 --> 992.88
them I mean Dr Shiva would probably like

990.319 --> 998.16
allow Flat Earth to be a subject of

992.88 --> 1002.04
discussion again in schools to open up

998.16 --> 1004.56
debates to undo like the specific anti

1002.04 --> 1006.68
Flat Earth programming the shaming

1004.56 --> 1008.959
tactics to like get that out of the

1006.68 --> 1013.92
standard curriculum that's something he

1008.959 --> 1016.7589999999999
would do okay he's not going to talk

1013.92 --> 1020.199
about Flat Earth on his

1016.759 --> 1023.279
show don't be an idiot

1020.199 --> 1023.279
don't even expect

1025.959 --> 1031.64
that in in a in a certain sense I'd be

1029.12 --> 1035.3999999999999
pissed off if he did that because then

1031.64 --> 1038.039
he compromised his chances of actually

1035.4 --> 1038.039
succeeding

1047.4 --> 1052.1200000000001
here

1049.28 --> 1054.8799999999999
yeah yeah he did start yeah that was

1052.12 --> 1059.28
amazing teaching kids how to use bad

1054.88 --> 1062.72
words yes there's a time and a place for

1059.28 --> 1065.16
cursing it's all about timing and just a

1062.72 --> 1067.76
proper

1065.16 --> 1073.3600000000001
placement right swearing can just be

1067.76 --> 1073.36
ugly can be pointless or it can be

1073.4 --> 1081.44
like a beacon a symbol of a moment of

1077.88 --> 1081.44
some unjustified

1087.88 --> 1091.72
outrage a tool

1107.32 --> 1110.32
correct

1126.25 --> 1129.45
[Music]

1131.4 --> 1136.8400000000001
no you know what I'm thinking about is a

1134.2 --> 1136.8400000000001
much better

1137.32 --> 1145.8799999999999
idea like but I mean this is like

1141.0 --> 1150.2
basically after everything is over

1145.88 --> 1151.919
like all this smart City nonsense well

1150.2 --> 1154.679
what if the people that have been

1151.919 --> 1156.679
orchestrating this are basically taken

1154.679 --> 1160.039
out of

1156.679 --> 1161.72
power and then they get to live in a

1160.039 --> 1165.8799999999999
smart

1161.72 --> 1168.6000000000001
City yeah and like not allowed out like

1165.88 --> 1173.6000000000001
oh that was your plan for us well now

1168.6 --> 1178.08
it's the plan for you now you can be the

1173.6 --> 1178.08
subject to your own freaking

1179.88 --> 1183.4
plans how about

1184.12 --> 1189.2399999999998
that I mean it's better than sending

1186.76 --> 1189.24
them to

1190.4 --> 1195.5590000000002
camps and hey the industry can still

1193.52 --> 1197.36
keep do it doing it right it's all the

1195.559 --> 1200.0
investment all the all the plans all the

1197.36 --> 1202.799
things he wanted to test out oh cool

1200.0 --> 1205.679
well there's a whole bunch of [ __ ]

1202.799 --> 1209.48
insane

1205.679 --> 1211.6000000000001
Elites that are going to be yeah

1209.48 --> 1215.2
basically criminally

1211.6 --> 1216.76
charged and yeah it could all like throw

1215.2 --> 1220.559
them in an oven or

1216.76 --> 1223.799
something or you could basically lock

1220.559 --> 1227.1589999999999
them up in a smart city like make them

1223.799 --> 1229.76
the subject of their own crazy dystopian

1227.159 --> 1233.24
experiment like

1229.76 --> 1235.36
completely eating Z bugs and the fake

1233.24 --> 1240.76
meat and all of

1235.36 --> 1243.0
it 15 minute City Style all of it just

1240.76 --> 1246.72
put them in there yeah they wanted that

1243.0 --> 1246.72
for everybody now put them in

1250.6 --> 1255.4399999999998
there yeah okay dank fair enough

1257.12 --> 1262.7199999999998
but I mean it's not going to be as

1260.52 --> 1265.8799999999999
satisfactory as you think it would be

1262.72 --> 1267.679
you know they're not going to have that

1265.88 --> 1269.679
that look on their face that you want

1267.679 --> 1272.799
them to

1269.679 --> 1276.6000000000001
have you're going to

1272.799 --> 1276.6
doubt the nature of

1285.96 --> 1293.0
humanity you see yeah because

1289.24 --> 1295.159
look here is why I get so brutal like

1293.0 --> 1297.559
with my description like imping them and

1295.159 --> 1301.2
lighting them F yeah

1297.559 --> 1304.48
why because of the deterrent effect yeah

1301.2 --> 1306.159
if they're all arrested and there's like

1304.48 --> 1309.48
okay the neuron B too what are we going

1306.159 --> 1313.3200000000002
to do right there's no more [ __ ]

1309.48 --> 1316.88
point yeah despite what you might think

1313.32 --> 1321.279
I actually don't like horror torture

1316.88 --> 1323.2
[ __ ] yeah H I'm not a natural sadist

1321.279 --> 1327.2
sadism only comes

1323.2 --> 1327.2
out out of extreme

1327.88 --> 1336.279
frustration okay so I don't think it has

1332.64 --> 1337.919
a point to be that brutal even once it's

1336.279 --> 1342.6
finally

1337.919 --> 1346.679
over yeah the brutality has a point as a

1342.6 --> 1349.9599999999998
deterrent as in while they're still in

1346.679 --> 1355.0
power to discourage them from getting

1349.96 --> 1355.0
any ideas that kind of thing right or

1355.12 --> 1361.3999999999999
Regional you know so that they don't get

1358.36 --> 1362.7199999999998
any ideas oh let's do this too yeah

1361.4 --> 1364.8400000000001
that's why

1362.72 --> 1367.799
brutality but if they're if it's

1364.84 --> 1370.12
literally oh it's it's done right

1367.799 --> 1372.84
they're out of power they're getting

1370.12 --> 1375.799
arrested and the trials we get then

1372.84 --> 1379.24
there's no freaking point in being

1375.799 --> 1383.679
brutal it's not s satisfa it's not going

1379.24 --> 1386.24
to satisfy you tet it

1383.679 --> 1389.3200000000002
isn't and then that's going to piss you

1386.24 --> 1392.919
off even more because now you realize

1389.32 --> 1395.1589999999999
that you held on to a vengeful thought

1392.919 --> 1397.0
that in reality didn't even turn out to

1395.159 --> 1399.8400000000001
be satisfying and now that hunger is

1397.0 --> 1402.12
going to keep eating at you and now you

1399.84 --> 1406.0
realize it's never going to go away

1402.12 --> 1406.0
again even if they're all

1406.12 --> 1409.8799999999999
dead there's no point

1415.64 --> 1419.5590000000002
yeah D I mean good luck with

1436.88 --> 1439.88
that

1441.88 --> 1448.24
look if Shiva can get away with dramatic

1445.4 --> 1448.24
action like

1448.6 --> 1451.84
that good

1454.159 --> 1459.279
luck in the scale of all things I don't

1456.84 --> 1459.279
think it's

1460.24 --> 1465.88
realistic it's all too interwoven inter

1462.799 --> 1465.8799999999999
tangle entangled

1466.799 --> 1469.799
it's

1472.919 --> 1476.5200000000002
it's going to be tougher than you

1496.76 --> 1499.76
think

1500.28 --> 1503.42
[Music]

1518.74 --> 1522.049
[Music]

1526.679 --> 1529.679
h

1535.2 --> 1541.919
man Illuminati kasan hit the spot

1539.24 --> 1545.88
wow I was very hungry but it's also

1541.919 --> 1545.88
because I I didn't really eat enough

1552.799 --> 1559.399
yesterday I just wanted to have another

1556.039 --> 1562.12
meat-free day because

1559.399 --> 1564.6399999999999
I I eat meat let's be clear but I don't

1562.12 --> 1567.1999999999998
eat it every day in the days that I

1564.64 --> 1571.24
don't eat it the day after I usually

1567.2 --> 1574.0800000000002
have like extra high concentration and

1571.24 --> 1577.799
dreamwalk ability you

1574.08 --> 1582.24
see because when I eat meat like chicken

1577.799 --> 1584.6
or whatever or beef it does like really

1582.24 --> 1586.6
nourish me and it like takes it IT

1584.6 --> 1589.1589999999999
restores

1586.6 --> 1592.08
issues it literally makes me feel

1589.159 --> 1595.96
younger and that stays for a while then

1592.08 --> 1600.84
slowly starts wearing away again

1595.96 --> 1605.3990000000001
right but if I don't eat meat then

1600.84 --> 1605.399
usually I have better focus the next

1608.84 --> 1616.36
day and I'm trying to use

1613.159 --> 1618.5200000000002
that it's like yay I eat meat that's so

1616.36 --> 1620.6
useful I'm and I know everything I can

1618.52 --> 1623.72
do with that and then yay I don't eat

1620.6 --> 1626.12
meat I can use that too like everything

1623.72 --> 1628.64
has an advantage

1626.12 --> 1632.7199999999998
everything just up to you

1628.64 --> 1635.96
to decide with what angle of

1632.72 --> 1638.279
approach you're going to deal with it or

1635.96 --> 1640.76
you're going to be like oh no oh why

1638.279 --> 1644.72
does it always go

1640.76 --> 1646.72
wrong or are you going to say well this

1644.72 --> 1648.1200000000001
has an advantage that has an advantage

1646.72 --> 1651.64
everything has an adant

1648.12 --> 1651.6399999999999
Vantage just be

1652.03 --> 1656.6
[Music]

1654.039 --> 1658.68
positive and then life just doesn't suck

1656.6 --> 1661.779
as

1658.68 --> 1661.779
[Music]

1665.64 --> 1670.1200000000001
much okay is anybody going to say

1667.96 --> 1672.519
anything or was that it everybody just

1670.12 --> 1672.5189999999998
left

1676.519 --> 1679.519
now

1681.399 --> 1686.399
ah two Giant Hamburgers from what the

1684.559 --> 1689.399
hell okay

1686.399 --> 1689.399
breakfast

1706.44 --> 1709.44
okay

1712.559 --> 1720.44
I mean around my 20s I've had plenty of

1715.44 --> 1720.44
hamburgers for lunch but breakfast

1727.76 --> 1733.919
no but then again I'm not much of a

1730.279 --> 1733.919
breakfast person

1736.399 --> 1739.399
anyhow

1740.24 --> 1744.679
all

1741.039 --> 1744.679
right take some of

1750.799 --> 1757.279
this the Cornerstone of any nutricious

1753.84 --> 1757.279
breakfast what a

1766.32 --> 1769.32
hamburger

1787.84 --> 1790.9189999999999
Hey sing star

1793.2 --> 1799.8400000000001
water difficulty time digesting protein

1796.919 --> 1799.8400000000001
on that's that's

1808.08 --> 1813.84
odd is it like hereditary

1811.36 --> 1816.799
or I've never heard of

1813.84 --> 1820.519
that that like protein is like usually

1816.799 --> 1824.44
one of the more easy things to

1820.519 --> 1824.44
process because it's like so

1824.76 --> 1829.799
critical hope it's not like a recent

1826.96 --> 1829.799
devel velopment or

1835.159 --> 1840.6000000000001
anything

1837.6 --> 1840.6
ah

1851.64 --> 1859.24
yeah but yeah the nutritional Foods

1854.559 --> 1859.24
pyramid is absolutely a scam

1869.6 --> 1875.24
absolutely I mean I've had days where I

1872.08 --> 1878.84
literally don't even eat any

1875.24 --> 1881.3990000000001
carbs bread or anything or like then

1878.84 --> 1885.1589999999999
like the only type of carbs that I get

1881.399 --> 1887.8799999999999
is like two slices of bread with my

1885.159 --> 1891.919
eggs for the entire day that that was

1887.88 --> 1895.2
what it was like when I was eating the

1891.919 --> 1897.72
um the Chicken vegetables with all the

1895.2 --> 1900.0
sunball pepper and turmerican stuff

1897.72 --> 1902.48
right because I didn't eat rice with

1900.0 --> 1906.799
that it's just no that is just it it's

1902.48 --> 1909.32
just vegetables chicken coconut fat and

1906.799 --> 1911.96
like all these spices like that is it

1909.32 --> 1915.799
that is the meal and it's very

1911.96 --> 1915.799
satisfying like what do you mean

1916.159 --> 1919.159
carbs

1920.679 --> 1928.3600000000001
so for me good fats is always a key

1924.559 --> 1930.799
factor I've noticed like fats is the

1928.36 --> 1934.1999999999998
most important factor for my diet that's

1930.799 --> 1936.96
just what I noticed when I eat bad fats

1934.2 --> 1939.88
I really

1936.96 --> 1942.88
notice really fast that there a

1939.88 --> 1942.88
detrimental side

1946.08 --> 1952.72
effect most notably skin like I

1949.679 --> 1955.8400000000001
immediately noticed that my skin just

1952.72 --> 1957.519
like if I somehow ate bad fat my skin

1955.84 --> 1960.6
just starts to reject

1957.519 --> 1962.279
it very quickly which is great by the

1960.6 --> 1965.4399999999998
way because it's better than that it

1962.279 --> 1967.96
keeps lingering around or build up in my

1965.44 --> 1967.96
gut or

1972.36 --> 1978.6789999999999
something but it does basically turn

1976.24 --> 1981.08
yeah come down to to like I cannot eat

1978.679 --> 1984.3990000000001
any non-organic fat

1981.08 --> 1984.399
ever like

1984.72 --> 1992.76
candy simple Foods nut meat I just can't

1989.639 --> 1992.76
do it at

2005.96 --> 2008.96
all

2012.399 --> 2016.4399999999998
skate

2013.44 --> 2016.44
park

2035.96 --> 2040.24
okay

2038.159 --> 2041.919
right so yeah it's the the summer seems

2040.24 --> 2045.039
to be hot all

2041.919 --> 2047.96
around with some Cloud covering like

2045.039 --> 2050.48
here it's kind of funny because in July

2047.96 --> 2053.04
everywhere it wasn't that super

2050.48 --> 2055.679
hot and then like in the middle of

2053.04 --> 2058.2
August suddenly it became very hot again

2055.679 --> 2061.32
over here and in the United States like

2058.2 --> 2065.04
what is that like how does that

2061.32 --> 2068.3990000000003
work like how does the heat output from

2065.04 --> 2073.079
the Sun oscillate like this

2068.399 --> 2075.7599999999998
like why like you're not going to f fool

2073.079 --> 2077.76
me with some [ __ ] explanation about

2075.76 --> 2080.7200000000003
oh it's the

2077.76 --> 2083.96
atmospheric because now this or that

2080.72 --> 2086.1189999999997
like no no no it's literally the Sun out

2083.96 --> 2088.8
the sun is just different like it's

2086.119 --> 2090.639
stronger now why why is it stronger now

2088.8 --> 2093.48
than it was in the middle of

2090.639 --> 2096.599
July when in June it was also very

2093.48 --> 2100.52
strong and but why wasn't it in July

2096.599 --> 2100.52
like what what's going

2102.68 --> 2107.5989999999997
on right because even then there were

2105.599 --> 2109.1600000000003
days where it was clear skyed and it

2107.599 --> 2113.119
just wasn't that

2109.16 --> 2113.1189999999997
hot what's going on

2118.64 --> 2125.359
there so I see

2121.2 --> 2125.359
that as there is some kind of

2125.8 --> 2130.1600000000003
oscillation

2127.48 --> 2132.76
swing with the sun's output and that is

2130.16 --> 2135.7999999999997
in the first instance already

2132.76 --> 2138.28
what what basically causes the seasons

2135.8 --> 2139.7200000000003
it is the swing of the pendulum like

2138.28 --> 2144.599
full summer

2139.72 --> 2148.1189999999997
heat minimum winter and little micro

2144.599 --> 2150.56
swings in between right like spring

2148.119 --> 2153.6800000000003
break which is still in Winter and

2150.56 --> 2156.24
suddenly a pea heat and that goes away

2153.68 --> 2158.52
again and then slowly builds up so that

2156.24 --> 2161.9199999999996
type of oscillation patterns is

2158.52 --> 2164.68
throughout the solar output within a

2161.92 --> 2168.7200000000003
year but this one I can't really place

2164.68 --> 2173.24
like why would it dip during

2168.72 --> 2176.359
July and then go back up again in

2173.24 --> 2178.72
August not just circumstantial but just

2176.359 --> 2182.52
like the the very energy output of the

2178.72 --> 2184.7599999999998
sun itself why would it why is it always

2182.52 --> 2184.7599999999998
like

2185.72 --> 2192.48
that every year I'm not

2189.0 --> 2192.48
sure I don't

2193.24 --> 2198.68
remember on the surface it doesn't feel

2195.76 --> 2201.4
like it just feels like there's

2198.68 --> 2203.52
something I mean the the patterns have

2201.4 --> 2205.48
been changing around and guys I have

2203.52 --> 2207.24
dark World related Visions again which

2205.48 --> 2209.92
are very

2207.24 --> 2213.9199999999996
weird cuz it was an

2209.92 --> 2216.7200000000003
item in my big Vision like how the

2213.92 --> 2218.319
pattern I think I think I even told that

2216.72 --> 2220.839
on the show already

2218.319 --> 2223.96
that

2220.839 --> 2228.4
somehow I got access to the mechanism of

2223.96 --> 2231.599
the heavens which includes the output

2228.4 --> 2235.079
regulator yeah yeah that's right like a

2231.599 --> 2236.839
machine output regulator of the sun yeah

2235.079 --> 2239.48
and you have to programming lighted my

2236.839 --> 2241.7599999999998
sheine in the dark world yeah I don't

2239.48 --> 2244.359
know why man that's just what I

2241.76 --> 2247.3590000000004
experienced and then I came up with like

2244.359 --> 2250.16
this is a more efficient way

2247.359 --> 2250.16
like a better

2253.16 --> 2258.48
oscillation but there was upheaval about

2255.72 --> 2261.04
it but it was actually better as in like

2258.48 --> 2262.8
really better for nature and humanity

2261.04 --> 2265.96
and productivity and everything it was

2262.8 --> 2268.88
like a better way to

2265.96 --> 2271.599
divide the celestial

2268.88 --> 2273.04
output that was in my Dark World Vision

2271.599 --> 2276.839
guys I don't know you can think that

2273.04 --> 2281.079
it's all just like oh you're just crazy

2276.839 --> 2282.7999999999997
hallucinations Arn or I actually was

2281.079 --> 2284.079
doing that and I've been like a

2282.8 --> 2287.76
Celestial

2284.079 --> 2287.76
regulator on the other

2288.2 --> 2295.839
side I just know I made very careful

2291.359 --> 2299.04
work of it and on the other

2295.839 --> 2301.0
side like finding a better way for it to

2299.04 --> 2302.24
oscillate that would make that would

2301.0 --> 2305.839
like

2302.24 --> 2308.52
maximize farming output optimize

2305.839 --> 2308.52
environment

2309.4 --> 2315.64
Cycles like including like insects and

2312.24 --> 2318.4399999999996
everything it would be I I thought that

2315.64 --> 2321.5989999999997
I F found a better

2318.44 --> 2324.7200000000003
Celestial oscillation pattern that would

2321.599 --> 2327.4
benefit nature and Humanity

2324.72 --> 2331.0
both

2327.4 --> 2334.0
okay now did that get implemented I did

2331.0 --> 2335.52
have the impression that it did and

2334.0 --> 2337.56
we're talking about

2335.52 --> 2339.7599999999998
97

2337.56 --> 2342.7999999999997
so it's not something that oh that just

2339.76 --> 2347.3190000000004
changed but it should have like kind of

2342.8 --> 2347.319
transitioned in the last two decades

2348.04 --> 2356.72
somewhere and I'm still studying it to

2353.72 --> 2359.68
see and to compare with my memories from

2356.72 --> 2359.68
the '90s and the

2365.44 --> 2368.44
80s

2372.48 --> 2378.88
man-made climate change well

2375.839 --> 2383.24
hilariously when you think about it if

2378.88 --> 2386.079
that dark World Vision that I had is

2383.24 --> 2389.7999999999997
real then you could say that this

2386.079 --> 2392.119
climate change is man-made if a man uses

2389.8 --> 2393.8390000000004
their higher dimensional self to alter

2392.119 --> 2396.92
the mechanism of the

2393.839 --> 2399.7599999999998
heavens well that's literally manmade

2396.92 --> 2399.76
climate change

2401.119 --> 2408.079
then then I effectively changed the

2403.64 --> 2408.0789999999997
climate by tinkering with the celestial

2410.8 --> 2415.1600000000003
mechanism and yeah good luck with that

2413.24 --> 2418.0
good luck trying to change it

2415.16 --> 2420.3999999999996
back I don't think there was even other

2418.0 --> 2423.119
spirits around that could do what I

2420.4 --> 2426.04
could and everybody was really nervous

2423.119 --> 2430.96
about what that I could do that and they

2426.04 --> 2432.72
Fe me why because they didn't know how

2430.96 --> 2436.64
to change it

2432.72 --> 2439.64
back yeah they weren't smart enough to

2436.64 --> 2439.64
be able to do

2439.96 --> 2443.2
that I

2447.56 --> 2455.0789999999997
am or whatever that experience I had is

2452.839 --> 2458.04
is that me is that me riding through

2455.079 --> 2460.6400000000003
somebody else's eyes I don't know but I

2458.04 --> 2462.119
experienced it as being me I was

2460.64 --> 2464.1189999999997
tinkering with the mechanism of the

2462.119 --> 2466.8
heavens for the betterment of mankind

2464.119 --> 2470.2000000000003
and and

2466.8 --> 2473.1600000000003
God and other people were unnerved about

2470.2 --> 2475.72
it because they literally couldn't

2473.16 --> 2478.359
change any it's like I had that power

2475.72 --> 2481.04
and they were like but we can't we don't

2478.359 --> 2483.2799999999997
know how to like we don't have that

2481.04 --> 2485.0
power we can't change it like why does

2483.28 --> 2487.5600000000004
he have that power

2485.0 --> 2490.0
why you know how that goes there

2487.56 --> 2492.599
Grapplers all

2490.0 --> 2497.359
around and they were all very unnerfed

2492.599 --> 2499.4
like but he has like but like it's that

2497.359 --> 2503.7999999999997
safe

2499.4 --> 2503.8
and like yeah it is safe it

2504.28 --> 2510.1600000000003
works it's not going to go wrong and it

2507.079 --> 2511.8390000000004
isn't going wrong and you're not smart

2510.16 --> 2514.96
enough to restore

2511.839 --> 2518.2599999999998
it back to the old system which was not

2514.96 --> 2521.559
as good and leave leads to more

2518.26 --> 2521.559
[Music]

2525.92 --> 2531.8
hazards Because by the the way the

2528.96 --> 2534.68
energy outputs have been

2531.8 --> 2537.6800000000003
arranged the oscillation of It All Leads

2534.68 --> 2542.2
to less to less

2537.68 --> 2542.2
extreme polarized Peaks

2542.4 --> 2548.359
within the entire framework which is

2546.24 --> 2550.72
typically the thing that gets the ex the

2548.359 --> 2553.7999999999997
most extreme weather

2550.72 --> 2556.5589999999997
things right well of course there is

2553.8 --> 2560.119
still some extreme weather but

2556.559 --> 2563.6800000000003
guys it can be much worse and in the far

2560.119 --> 2568.6400000000003
past it has been much

2563.68 --> 2570.7599999999998
worse it can get very bad and yeah it

2568.64 --> 2572.96
looks bad like when there's a big

2570.76 --> 2575.48
tornado especially like with freaking

2572.96 --> 2577.96
Firestorm and [ __ ] and like mud slides

2575.48 --> 2580.96
and P class PLC flow yeah it's all very

2577.96 --> 2585.44
impressive and extreme and it is

2580.96 --> 2588.68
devastating but trust me it can be much

2585.44 --> 2590.96
worse and it has been and it would have

2588.68 --> 2595.0789999999997
been

2590.96 --> 2597.359
again but with the new pattern it's kind

2595.079 --> 2599.599
of weird now talking like it's I

2597.359 --> 2601.5589999999997
basically now connected my Dark World up

2599.599 --> 2603.52
with reum just assuming that it's

2601.559 --> 2604.92
completely real that's how I'm going

2603.52 --> 2607.16
about because otherwise it's just

2604.92 --> 2610.16
getting too licated trying to

2607.16 --> 2612.839
compartmentalize it all with

2610.16 --> 2616.5589999999997
prefaces but basically by implementing

2612.839 --> 2620.52
the new version I have

2616.559 --> 2620.52
avoided pretty extreme

2620.68 --> 2627.2
cataclysms so yeah yet another

2623.119 --> 2627.2000000000003
contribution Arwin save the world

2632.92 --> 2638.88
again just giving some ch out to a

2636.559 --> 2641.96
couple of trolls out there

2638.88 --> 2644.119
that they I I said that once that was

2641.96 --> 2645.079
like in the beginning when I was not

2644.119 --> 2648.319
super

2645.079 --> 2650.52
secure about the Dark World Visions but

2648.319 --> 2652.88
I did remember like I had gone through a

2650.52 --> 2656.2
whole bunch of

2652.88 --> 2658.92
[ __ ] just so I could alter things

2656.2 --> 2664.3999999999996
slightly and save the

2658.92 --> 2668.0
world and it did succeed but at a great

2664.4 --> 2668.0
cost for myself

2668.72 --> 2673.04
and the trolls when they heard me say

2670.76 --> 2677.3190000000004
that thought it was really amazingly

2673.04 --> 2683.16
hilarious so they like echoed that for

2677.319 --> 2683.16
years I think I said it in 2016 or 17

2687.2 --> 2694.5589999999997
somewhere I don't think that you that

2690.319 --> 2699.72
about you Dark World what I want to hear

2694.559 --> 2699.7200000000003
about them you do want to hear okay okay

2704.44 --> 2708.16
what all right fair

2718.16 --> 2722.96
enough that's cool I I appreciate that

2721.119 --> 2727.079
you guys are very open-minded about

2722.96 --> 2729.7200000000003
especially you dank it's just

2727.079 --> 2732.6800000000003
Dark World Visions are [ __ ] freaky

2729.72 --> 2734.7599999999998
okay when people have like lucid dream

2732.68 --> 2736.8799999999997
experiences regularly and that start to

2734.76 --> 2740.0400000000004
have like direct influence on their

2736.88 --> 2744.4
actual Waking Life that's freaky on

2740.04 --> 2747.4
itself what I had is just off the scale

2744.4 --> 2750.319
dude having a parallel experiences that

2747.4 --> 2752.52
literally reaches throughout time like

2750.319 --> 2754.88
that's just

2752.52 --> 2757.88
beyond

2754.88 --> 2757.88
normal

2757.96 --> 2761.44
I've never heard anybody

2763.079 --> 2769.04
else be open about it I know there's

2766.72 --> 2772.9599999999996
other people that have had the same

2769.04 --> 2778.2799999999997
experiences I have in a

2772.96 --> 2778.28
way but they never talk about

2779.839 --> 2784.7999999999997
it you can hardly get them to admit to

2783.319 --> 2787.8
it in

2784.8 --> 2787.8
private

2791.0 --> 2796.76
I'm just so fascinated by

2793.359 --> 2800.5589999999997
it that I'm like how can you waste such

2796.76 --> 2804.3190000000004
a unique study opportunity and not talk

2800.559 --> 2804.3190000000004
about it I don't understand how that's

2805.839 --> 2814.52
possible I mean I'm like a living weird

2811.04 --> 2817.839
surreal time travel based sci-fi Netflix

2814.52 --> 2819.88
series and I'm a living person and I'm

2817.839 --> 2822.52
not a script that's written it's

2819.88 --> 2828.359
literally things that I've experienced I

2822.52 --> 2828.359
mean how could I not exploit

2844.72 --> 2847.72
this

2849.04 --> 2853.8
right I mean it's getting to the point

2851.359 --> 2855.52
where I just watch like oh another time

2853.8 --> 2857.6400000000003
based Netflix

2855.52 --> 2859.52
series and it just feels like yeah

2857.64 --> 2862.04
that's all just based on

2859.52 --> 2863.88
me it's just starting to feel like that

2862.04 --> 2867.839
more and more it's less like oh what a

2863.88 --> 2869.28
mystery oh so oh it's just like yeah

2867.839 --> 2872.96
I've done

2869.28 --> 2875.0400000000004
that yeah not like oh I watched

2872.96 --> 2877.44
something like that no it's like no I've

2875.04 --> 2881.5589999999997
done that

2877.44 --> 2884.48
whatever that is I I probably already

2881.559 --> 2887.7200000000003
simulated parts of that series within my

2884.48 --> 2890.44
Dark World Visions like 20 years ago

2887.72 --> 2894.0789999999997
because hey yeah within those 80 years I

2890.44 --> 2896.96
got the I got faced with a whole bunch

2894.079 --> 2899.52
of series and movies and scenes from

2896.96 --> 2901.04
first perspective which is absolutely

2899.52 --> 2904.64
impossible of

2901.04 --> 2906.16
course but it happened anyway like Oh

2904.64 --> 2909.0
yay

2906.16 --> 2913.92
I'm in the movie as the main

2909.0 --> 2916.2
actor but not like a puppet that can see

2913.92 --> 2919.6800000000003
along with the actor but just like Oh no

2916.2 --> 2922.5589999999997
you're actually you in the actor's body

2919.68 --> 2927.9199999999996
in that scene in the

2922.559 --> 2930.559
movie and uh yeah you figure it

2927.92 --> 2933.319
out that sort of stuff like all these

2930.559 --> 2936.28
movies and especially scary

2933.319 --> 2938.52
ones and that is so weird because I I

2936.28 --> 2941.4
did throughout the whole process realize

2938.52 --> 2944.4
that more and more like this is not real

2941.4 --> 2945.799
this is not a real world experience like

2944.4 --> 2950.599
this has to be a

2945.799 --> 2950.599
movie cuz they didn't tell me I didn't

2951.0 --> 2956.559
know and they were like trying to tell a

2953.96 --> 2958.2400000000002
story to me with all of it like one

2956.559 --> 2961.96
experience to another and they were like

2958.24 --> 2963.9599999999996
trying to explain things to me they were

2961.96 --> 2965.68
actually probably just recruiting me

2963.96 --> 2968.599
into Satanism that's what they were

2965.68 --> 2972.48
really trying and with they I mean not

2968.599 --> 2974.1600000000003
other people but like arguably Satan

2972.48 --> 2976.68
himself or

2974.16 --> 2980.0
Lucifer that took the shape of the

2976.68 --> 2982.5989999999997
Jesuit guy and wasn't actually him

2980.0 --> 2984.52
because most of those parts of those of

2982.599 --> 2987.76
that Dark World Experience like the

2984.52 --> 2990.559
actual guy that that imagery was based

2987.76 --> 2991.76
on didn't even know about like I told

2990.559 --> 2993.6800000000003
him a whole bunch of things and this and

2991.76 --> 2994.5200000000004
that like I don't know what you're

2993.68 --> 2996.1189999999997
talking

2994.52 --> 2998.799
about

2996.119 --> 2998.799
and he wasn't

2999.359 --> 3002.359
lying

3002.96 --> 3008.88
so but yeah I got to experience a whole

3005.88 --> 3008.88
bunch of scary

3009.319 --> 3014.319
movies that weren't even out yet and

3012.119 --> 3016.359
then I they were forcing me basically to

3014.319 --> 3019.52
go through like a horror movie not

3016.359 --> 3022.52
knowing it's a movie but catching on

3019.52 --> 3026.48
slowly one after another like hey I'm

3022.52 --> 3030.48
being put into like a terror scene

3026.48 --> 3030.48
or like oh I'm now the bad

3030.52 --> 3036.96
guy I was put in the bad guy skin a lot

3034.799 --> 3040.04
for some

3036.96 --> 3043.2
reason and then I somehow had to like

3040.04 --> 3046.52
reconcile with that the realization that

3043.2 --> 3048.0
were forced upon me with being put into

3046.52 --> 3051.04
the skin of that

3048.0 --> 3052.96
role it's like I am now this and then

3051.04 --> 3055.04
it's like oh how do I deal with this

3052.96 --> 3057.2400000000002
it's like Arwin is suddenly that person

3055.04 --> 3061.0
he has L become that person how do you

3057.24 --> 3061.0
deal with that Arn

3061.2 --> 3066.359
like that that pretty much happened like

3063.799 --> 3068.359
oh oh here's the next [ __ ] up figure

3066.359 --> 3072.319
oh you're this person

3068.359 --> 3074.2799999999997
now right but not with like it would

3072.319 --> 3077.72
just happen I

3074.28 --> 3079.96
wouldn't have like a linear ability to

3077.72 --> 3082.5589999999997
keep connecting every time I shove me a

3079.96 --> 3085.64
new person I would also be like H what's

3082.559 --> 3087.6400000000003
going on I would not have connection

3085.64 --> 3089.72
memory of the one moment to another it's

3087.64 --> 3092.319
just I just a new moment happened and

3089.72 --> 3097.0
it's like a full reset it's

3092.319 --> 3097.0
like what's What's Happening Now who am

3099.88 --> 3105.76
I I couldn't

3102.44 --> 3108.96
like look at the very experience from a

3105.76 --> 3111.44
third perspective that could connect one

3108.96 --> 3113.839
moment to another I didn't have that

3111.44 --> 3116.119
ability during the experience I have

3113.839 --> 3118.88
that ability continually during my

3116.119 --> 3121.559
waking experience there's a third person

3118.88 --> 3123.359
basically that is continually connecting

3121.559 --> 3125.559
whatever is happening Life coming

3123.359 --> 3126.5589999999997
directly with my conscious and all that

3125.559 --> 3129.7200000000003
rolling

3126.559 --> 3133.44
out that is continually there putting

3129.72 --> 3135.2799999999997
one scene next to the other it's always

3133.44 --> 3138.16
watching as to what's actually happening

3135.28 --> 3141.0
with me putting me together well in the

3138.16 --> 3144.799
Dark World Visions that part didn't seem

3141.0 --> 3145.88
to work or it was that part that was

3144.799 --> 3148.96
actually

3145.88 --> 3151.599
like forced into my main Consciousness

3148.96 --> 3155.96
somehow my main Consciousness was forced

3151.599 --> 3158.52
into that third person perspective which

3155.96 --> 3162.68
which shouldn't be

3158.52 --> 3162.68
possible now this is all getting a bit

3165.02 --> 3168.09
[Music]

3169.64 --> 3174.16
complicated it was very surreal all of

3174.24 --> 3179.839
it but the most surreal about it and the

3177.4 --> 3183.28
thing that really pulled me in was

3179.839 --> 3185.88
continually seeing things of the future

3183.28 --> 3188.76
like I can I can never let go of that

3185.88 --> 3193.52
feeling of just

3188.76 --> 3197.0
remembering how the [ __ ] did I see these

3193.52 --> 3200.799
very specific not even super impressive

3197.0 --> 3204.16
but very specific like YouTube

3200.799 --> 3207.7599999999998
videos like on a

3204.16 --> 3209.8799999999997
screen in the house where I was like the

3207.76 --> 3212.559
house was fully simulated too but I did

3209.88 --> 3215.119
catch like there was weird fractal

3212.559 --> 3216.92
Echoes and [ __ ] going on so it was clear

3215.119 --> 3219.2000000000003
like this is not entirely normal

3216.92 --> 3223.079
physical reality but it's attempting to

3219.2 --> 3223.0789999999997
be based on it in its

3223.24 --> 3227.24
representation but then I would just get

3225.16 --> 3230.839
to see videos that were like of the

3227.24 --> 3234.04
freaking future and it's like ah why is

3230.839 --> 3236.599
this happening how can that be why can I

3234.04 --> 3237.64
see a video that's like literally later

3236.599 --> 3242.1600000000003
came

3237.64 --> 3244.68
out like I saw that [ __ ] in 2011 guys

3242.16 --> 3248.8799999999997
2011 and

3244.68 --> 3250.799
12 in with living with my ex and in that

3248.88 --> 3254.119
house I just like had that experience

3250.799 --> 3256.24
like whoa I'm seeing this video like

3254.119 --> 3259.7200000000003
Flat

3256.24 --> 3264.2
Earth it's like where's the curvature

3259.72 --> 3265.72
where right that very famous start that

3264.2 --> 3268.7599999999998
that really early

3265.72 --> 3271.319
2015 video clip with the moving around

3268.76 --> 3273.5200000000004
of like seeing how incredibly flat

3271.319 --> 3276.52
everything is right going past like the

3273.52 --> 3280.04
ski lift and the boat and all that that

3276.52 --> 3283.7599999999998
specific video from Matt boand was it I

3280.04 --> 3287.079
saw that video in 2011 on his screen in

3283.76 --> 3288.92
the dark world and I remembered it a lot

3287.079 --> 3292.599
I remembered it so much that when I

3288.92 --> 3295.96
actually got to see it in

3292.599 --> 3297.48
2015 I got so scared literally sweat

3295.96 --> 3300.68
just broke

3297.48 --> 3305.48
out like the feeling you're going

3300.68 --> 3309.52
mad because I recognized the video so

3305.48 --> 3310.48
vividly like I saw this I saw this four

3309.52 --> 3314.359
years

3310.48 --> 3314.359
ago specifically

3319.16 --> 3325.799
this just like but it's even weirder

3322.44 --> 3328.359
like why how did I have Eric Dub's book

3325.799 --> 3328.359
in my

3328.76 --> 3332.0
hands in

3335.44 --> 3341.88
2001 how the [ __ ] is that

3338.92 --> 3344.16
possible the atlantian

3341.88 --> 3346.119
conspiracy that one specifically with

3344.16 --> 3349.72
the picture of the boat going over the

3346.119 --> 3352.96
watery waterfall Edge atlantian

3349.72 --> 3355.72
conspiracy right how the [ __ ] did I

3352.96 --> 3358.319
flick through that

3355.72 --> 3363.72
book in

3358.319 --> 3363.72
2011 can somebody please explain that to

3371.359 --> 3379.52
me or just not say anything in chat for

3375.72 --> 3379.52
15 minutes straight that's fine

3379.76 --> 3385.4
too maybe you're all stumbling into your

3383.359 --> 3386.52
own Dark World Visions now you're just

3385.4 --> 3389.96
like

3386.52 --> 3389.96
ah what's

3392.599 --> 3397.28
happening like what is this movie that

3395.079 --> 3397.28
I'm

3400.4 --> 3405.799
seeing some of you might literally now

3403.039 --> 3407.92
be weirdly drawn in with what I'm

3405.799 --> 3409.7599999999998
talking about and just I might be

3407.92 --> 3412.28
triggering dark World Visions of your

3409.76 --> 3414.3590000000004
own and you're now seeing like movies

3412.28 --> 3417.96
that are going to come out in 10 or 20

3414.359 --> 3419.92
years probably like in between five and

3417.96 --> 3423.359
10 years from

3419.92 --> 3425.599
now and yes I'm I'm actually stating

3423.359 --> 3428.48
that that could

3425.599 --> 3430.3590000000004
happen somebody's really in tune with

3428.48 --> 3432.68
the Dark World as in they're connected

3430.359 --> 3435.0
they're not afraid they're not hiding it

3432.68 --> 3437.96
and you listen to people that describe

3435.0 --> 3441.28
those things it will if you have the

3437.96 --> 3443.839
talent if you have the pineal gland Pure

3441.28 --> 3446.039
Clean enough to be able to it can

3443.839 --> 3449.7599999999998
literally trigger

3446.039 --> 3452.96
you starting to experience

3449.76 --> 3455.559
that and with me you could also say that

3452.96 --> 3457.48
Flat Earth had a a compounding effect

3455.559 --> 3460.079
because if Flat Earth would be brought

3457.48 --> 3465.28
up to me and I'm talking about decades

3460.079 --> 3468.079
ago well that would also directly

3465.28 --> 3470.92
connect to the Dark World fishs because

3468.079 --> 3474.0
they have been come intricately tied in

3470.92 --> 3477.319
I learned so much about Flat Earth from

3474.0 --> 3481.52
my freaking Dark World Visions because

3477.319 --> 3483.96
later in life as in 2015 I started to

3481.52 --> 3486.599
get into Flat Earth a lot and now I have

3483.96 --> 3488.799
a channel do an everyday show and

3486.599 --> 3491.48
because of that the Dark World Vision

3488.799 --> 3493.64
has provided me with so much hints and

3491.48 --> 3496.799
information and even videos in the

3493.64 --> 3498.4
future of Flat Earth because I was going

3496.799 --> 3503.599
to get into

3498.4 --> 3503.599
it and it always stunned and amazed

3503.72 --> 3510.64
me and even when I had more upfront

3507.039 --> 3513.28
realization about it I would be like

3510.64 --> 3515.96
it's magical like I feel like I felt

3513.28 --> 3520.2400000000002
like such a loser and an idiot and weak

3515.96 --> 3523.359
and snively complainy victim me a lot

3520.24 --> 3526.2799999999997
now not it wasn't like grabler level

3523.359 --> 3531.0
terrible but it was getting

3526.28 --> 3531.0
there when I was younger

3531.96 --> 3537.92
and yeah get the [ __ ] out of here D [ __ ]

3539.0 --> 3542.799
yeah losing track

3549.88 --> 3556.319
now right but to get back to what I was

3552.48 --> 3557.359
talking about it might trigger Visions

3556.319 --> 3561.079
with

3557.359 --> 3564.4
you if you have that ability like if you

3561.079 --> 3566.079
talk to a magical person that that's

3564.4 --> 3569.599
right magical

3566.079 --> 3571.1600000000003
frequencies then that might trigger your

3569.599 --> 3573.6400000000003
dormant

3571.16 --> 3575.839
magical writing

3573.64 --> 3578.359
ability that's how it

3575.839 --> 3583.44
works you're right with the

3578.359 --> 3583.44
frequency it's how I learned

3585.44 --> 3591.039
everything to me it's like a copy paste

3588.359 --> 3594.119
like somebody was in a state of mind

3591.039 --> 3596.96
understood things then it's like oh my

3594.119 --> 3599.039
God a pure frequency to me and I'm

3596.96 --> 3603.039
talking a little kid even and it's like

3599.039 --> 3606.3190000000004
a tune it's like I am going to like I

3603.039 --> 3610.3590000000004
become you and thereby I take your power

3606.319 --> 3613.88
as my own not taking it away but copying

3610.359 --> 3616.2799999999997
it now your power is my power because I

3613.88 --> 3619.1600000000003
attune to you and I assimilate the

3616.28 --> 3621.2000000000003
frequency and all the natural powers

3619.16 --> 3626.5589999999997
that come with

3621.2 --> 3629.0789999999997
it and I did that as a kid

3626.559 --> 3632.7200000000003
and I've been doing it ever since and

3629.079 --> 3636.28
then of course also went down the dark

3632.72 --> 3639.0389999999998
roads cuz I didn't really understand yet

3636.28 --> 3641.92
cuz yeah Darkness can be very appealing

3639.039 --> 3641.92
because of the power

3644.28 --> 3650.7200000000003
factor and I yeah and you underestimate

3647.76 --> 3653.5200000000004
that like oh the side effects it's just

3650.72 --> 3656.52
classic just like Star

3653.52 --> 3656.52
Wars

3657.039 --> 3663.3190000000004
but now I'm

3658.76 --> 3663.3190000000004
here and I think I'm doing pretty

3666.119 --> 3673.28
well and I have plenty

3669.72 --> 3674.9599999999996
of well-refined frequencies that are up

3673.28 --> 3677.599
and available for

3674.96 --> 3680.0
copying just be careful that you don't

3677.599 --> 3684.0
take over everything because I still

3680.0 --> 3684.96
have like the pressure of all of it and

3684.0 --> 3686.96
effective

3684.96 --> 3689.359
sort of living a bit of an unnatural

3686.96 --> 3692.799
type of life for a

3689.359 --> 3695.16
person being like a hermit like this and

3692.799 --> 3697.119
everything it is I have to admit it's

3695.16 --> 3699.92
slightly unnatural it's

3697.119 --> 3701.599
doable because of the dedication and the

3699.92 --> 3704.0
Purity but

3701.599 --> 3704.76
still it's not as satisfying as you

3704.0 --> 3707.039
might

3704.76 --> 3708.559
think having all that peace and quiet

3707.039 --> 3710.6800000000003
it's it's just grass is greener on the

3708.559 --> 3713.0
other side right I'm just like oh my God

3710.68 --> 3714.96
I wish I had like colleagues that I

3713.0 --> 3718.68
could talk to

3714.96 --> 3721.52
or a a friend Circle or something like

3718.68 --> 3723.799
that but yeah there's people

3721.52 --> 3725.2
because if when you're on the other side

3723.799 --> 3726.88
and you have all that then you're going

3725.2 --> 3729.279
to be thinking like oh man I wish I

3726.88 --> 3731.279
could just have some time alone so

3729.279 --> 3734.119
jealous of this rwi like has all the

3731.279 --> 3736.359
room in the world nobody no stupid

3734.119 --> 3740.599
friend that's going to like oh I need

3736.359 --> 3742.96
this and that no no no no right so it's

3740.599 --> 3746.3590000000004
always grass is greener on the other

3742.96 --> 3746.359
side like that

3760.559 --> 3766.76
things look better at a distance fine

3763.2 --> 3768.359
gon sick hello by the way but that's

3766.76 --> 3771.8390000000004
pretty much the

3768.359 --> 3776.0389999999998
same except that you're giving a more in

3771.839 --> 3779.72
detail explanation as to what

3776.039 --> 3779.7200000000003
causes the entire

3780.4 --> 3785.52
effect all right anyway I hope you are

3782.599 --> 3787.3590000000004
all enjoying the show we're already

3785.52 --> 3792.319
going for an

3787.359 --> 3792.319
hour chat seems a little slow bit

3803.279 --> 3807.44
today

3805.559 --> 3810.6400000000003
that was

3807.44 --> 3814.119
nice had the rool also was very

3810.64 --> 3814.1189999999997
nice it's been a

3822.68 --> 3827.319
while right but what I was saying like I

3824.96 --> 3830.0
got plenty of good frequencies and even

3827.319 --> 3832.279
the abilities that you can copy if you

3830.0 --> 3834.319
choose to like the things like

3832.279 --> 3836.279
magnetization what I do you can l

3834.319 --> 3837.72
actually learn that you can attempt to

3836.279 --> 3839.319
copy that from me and there's a good

3837.72 --> 3842.839
chance that it'll just

3839.319 --> 3844.96
work if you're not like oh I'm so scared

3842.839 --> 3849.16
that people are going to think I'm weird

3844.96 --> 3849.16
well if you're scared of that then

3850.799 --> 3854.96
yeah then you got a problem if you're

3853.4 --> 3858.039
just chicken [ __ ] yeah then you're going

3854.96 --> 3861.68
to not you're not going to do anything

3858.039 --> 3865.3190000000004
then you're not going to have the

3861.68 --> 3869.64
abilities yeah you can pretty much

3865.319 --> 3871.72
get a lot of different surreal abilities

3869.64 --> 3874.799
but you're going to have to actually own

3871.72 --> 3876.799
them or you will not be able to use them

3874.799 --> 3878.96
because you're just scared that people

3876.799 --> 3881.96
might find you

3878.96 --> 3881.96
weird

3885.119 --> 3893.2400000000002
yeah I'm just mostly scared that I'll

3889.2 --> 3896.9199999999996
just let my empathy drive me to contain

3893.24 --> 3901.2
myself to the point where I become less

3896.92 --> 3901.2000000000003
than I could be yeah that's my

3902.48 --> 3908.92
fear I'm I'm afraid that I that i' adapt

3906.2 --> 3912.2
to the the soup of retards too much

3908.92 --> 3912.2000000000003
that's my actual

3915.52 --> 3923.079
fear I'm that blade of grass that's

3918.48 --> 3926.079
afraid of not sticking out that's my

3923.079 --> 3926.079
fear

3944.799 --> 3947.599
only fear

3948.88 --> 3955.0
dies yeah well for me it's very simple

3952.16 --> 3958.359
just keep at it and don't let any kind

3955.0 --> 3960.92
of fear deter me like the fear of not

3958.359 --> 3964.24
being accepted or being seen as

3960.92 --> 3971.119
weird right

3964.24 --> 3971.1189999999997
just be cohesive be consistent be

3972.319 --> 3978.64
comprehensible and what what else can I

3974.44 --> 3982.2000000000003
do I can't be more

3978.64 --> 3985.52
acceptable because I can't do anything

3982.2 --> 3987.68
about that standard

3985.52 --> 3989.92
people find acceptable what they find

3987.68 --> 3994.0
acceptable it's purely up to their own

3989.92 --> 3996.88
choices and usually pushed around by

3994.0 --> 3998.96
group senses of what is

3996.88 --> 4001.119
acceptable A lot of people do that

3998.96 --> 4002.2
they're carried purely by peer pressure

4001.119 --> 4004.92
in that

4002.2 --> 4008.279
sense I can't do anything about that

4004.92 --> 4008.279
either you accept me or you

4008.72 --> 4012.9599999999996
don't and what I do and what I talk

4011.079 --> 4016.0
about there's nothing I can really do

4012.96 --> 4016.0
about that

4017.72 --> 4022.0389999999998
and attempting to convince somebody

4019.96 --> 4025.319
that's like not with

4022.039 --> 4028.3590000000004
you tends to like in my experience more

4025.319 --> 4031.359
than average result in exactly the

4028.359 --> 4033.96
opposite that they hate you even more or

4031.359 --> 4037.5589999999997
they pity you or they're more arrogant

4033.96 --> 4037.559
more sadistic

4041.88 --> 4046.48
so courage is not being

4044.48 --> 4049.92
Fearless

4046.48 --> 4052.96
yeah oh I am definitely not

4049.92 --> 4056.079
Fearless fear has been a big theme in my

4052.96 --> 4059.079
life when I was younger it was a real

4056.079 --> 4064.1600000000003
serious thing I had to overcome in many

4059.079 --> 4067.119
ways because I've had I had acute social

4064.16 --> 4068.3999999999996
anxiety like if there's more than three

4067.119 --> 4071.1600000000003
people around

4068.4 --> 4073.559
me I get

4071.16 --> 4075.5989999999997
nervous because now there's a group

4073.559 --> 4079.799
dynamic

4075.599 --> 4079.799
I don't know what to do with group

4079.839 --> 4086.279
dynamic people stop listening to me in

4083.2 --> 4090.5989999999997
group dynamic

4086.279 --> 4094.2
typically or that's what used to happen

4090.599 --> 4097.400000000001
now I've learned more and more that in a

4094.2 --> 4100.239
group dynamic if that it happens to be

4097.4 --> 4102.839
there you got to be more

4100.239 --> 4106.3589999999995
forceful and more

4102.839 --> 4110.3189999999995
loud and not be afraid and

4106.359 --> 4112.4400000000005
like and then it does work and I really

4110.319 --> 4114.319
wish sometimes that I had this same

4112.44 --> 4117.199
conviction and

4114.319 --> 4119.159000000001
strength but also the confidence man the

4117.199 --> 4121.2789999999995
confidence oh my God would that have

4119.159 --> 4123.3589999999995
helped when I was young but I didn't

4121.279 --> 4126.080000000001
have it so I couldn't do this what I'm

4123.359 --> 4130.1990000000005
doing right now is like hello Flat Earth

4126.08 --> 4134.359
early bird show let me talk for 2 to 4

4130.199 --> 4137.199
hours like there was no way

4134.359 --> 4139.96
that I could even like just the mere

4137.199 --> 4143.0
idea when I was a PR of doing something

4139.96 --> 4145.359
like this would make me hide under the

4143.0 --> 4148.52
table that's how unnerving I thought

4145.359 --> 4151.319
that would be and yet I'm just doing it

4148.52 --> 4155.679
I'm just doing

4151.319 --> 4155.679
it it's second nature to me

4161.0 --> 4169.04
now all right still there's yeah lots

4166.239 --> 4170.599999999999
of there's still a lot of like group

4169.04 --> 4173.96
dynamic

4170.6 --> 4176.4400000000005
mechanics of just the general people out

4173.96 --> 4180.04
here Dutch people all kinds of people

4176.44 --> 4180.04
that I do not

4180.359 --> 4186.96
understand despite all my

4182.96 --> 4189.6
centuries there are just like levels

4186.96 --> 4193.359
of collective

4189.6 --> 4195.4400000000005
communication that I just it it slips me

4193.359 --> 4199.64
by I see it happening and it's just like

4195.44 --> 4203.12
I don't understand what how how is this

4199.64 --> 4206.84
action leading to that response and that

4203.12 --> 4209.92
they both like see think that that is

4206.84 --> 4212.2390000000005
perfectly logical like oh yeah that

4209.92 --> 4216.4
thing they did should have that I I

4212.239 --> 4219.718999999999
don't get it I what like how does that

4216.4 --> 4221.36
work this so unnatural to me it's like

4219.719 --> 4224.56
what's

4221.36 --> 4226.96
happening how can there social

4224.56 --> 4229.4800000000005
interaction be like that and they both

4226.96 --> 4232.159
agree that that's Norm I don't

4229.48 --> 4235.159
understand and I I find these kinds of

4232.159 --> 4236.96
aberration all around with just people

4235.159 --> 4239.96
having conversations out there and me

4236.96 --> 4239.96
listening in on it

4241.6 --> 4246.120000000001
because I'm like a sneaky Kitty in a

4244.12 --> 4249.84
tree always listening in and

4246.12 --> 4252.08
everything it's just yeah is what it is

4249.84 --> 4252.08
I'm

4252.64 --> 4258.320000000001
curious

4255.44 --> 4258.32
but there's just

4258.4 --> 4264.159
like instinctual

4261.04 --> 4267.64
level social communication Dynamics

4264.159 --> 4270.28
between people that just to me they defy

4267.64 --> 4273.96
logic entirely like I don't understand

4270.28 --> 4277.5199999999995
how they could think that that is normal

4273.96 --> 4280.08
or the way to do it I I don't understand

4277.52 --> 4282.4800000000005
and it's not like it's super tight Niche

4280.08 --> 4284.12
friends for 20 years or something

4282.48 --> 4286.599999999999
because that's a whole different game

4284.12 --> 4288.4
right if you have super NE tight friends

4286.6 --> 4289.76
that have been like lifelong friends and

4288.4 --> 4292.36
they're buddies and they work together

4289.76 --> 4294.8
and all that's very different no is I'm

4292.36 --> 4296.239
just talking about people like they

4294.8 --> 4297.88
might have like known each other for

4296.239 --> 4299.919999999999
half a year it's like with a friend from

4297.88 --> 4303.56
a friend and then they talk in a certain

4299.92 --> 4305.719
way and then it's like yeah it's like

4303.56 --> 4308.719
yeah they get each other and I'm

4305.719 --> 4308.719
like

4311.4 --> 4318.599999999999
what I don't get this

4315.239 --> 4321.599999999999
what is that how is that

4318.6 --> 4324.1990000000005
normal I just it frustrates me and I see

4321.6 --> 4327.4400000000005
this happening

4324.199 --> 4330.599999999999
everywhere this like this weird

4327.44 --> 4333.48
alienated form of social interaction

4330.6 --> 4334.4800000000005
that I just don't understand I just

4333.48 --> 4337.199
don't get

4334.48 --> 4340.5599999999995
it and it's weird to me

4337.199 --> 4345.48
because me just not getting it is to me

4340.56 --> 4345.4800000000005
is technically inacceptable because well

4345.76 --> 4351.280000000001
I vowed to understand all

4348.76 --> 4354.96
things and with all things I mean all

4351.28 --> 4356.84
things and then just seeing something

4354.96 --> 4359.679
play out in your face that you can't

4356.84 --> 4362.719
figure out is really

4359.679 --> 4364.76
frustrating it's like why don't I

4362.719 --> 4368.199
understand

4364.76 --> 4372.12
this why don't I even recognize it why

4368.199 --> 4376.28
don't I see a pattern repeating itself

4372.12 --> 4379.48
why can't I see it why can't I

4376.28 --> 4380.639
see like zoom out and see there's it

4379.48 --> 4383.159
apply there's the apply there's the

4380.639 --> 4385.679
apply there's the apply there's

4383.159 --> 4388.839999999999
there and you get the whole graph and

4385.679 --> 4390.679
throughout time like oh that's what it

4388.84 --> 4392.4400000000005
is I'm not getting that with certain

4390.679 --> 4393.4
things it's just like every time it pops

4392.44 --> 4396.0
up it's

4393.4 --> 4400.239
like what

4396.0 --> 4403.08
what and I I just can't connect it up

4400.239 --> 4406.239
I'm not seeing the pattern of it and it

4403.08 --> 4409.28
very frustrating and I really only have

4406.239 --> 4410.678999999999
this with social interactions between

4409.28 --> 4413.08
other

4410.679 --> 4414.88
people that's the only thing I've got

4413.08 --> 4417.8
that with

4414.88 --> 4420.12
left and they only humans by the way not

4417.8 --> 4422.12
animals every time animals interact it's

4420.12 --> 4422.88
like perfectly understandable for me

4422.12 --> 4425.96
like

4422.88 --> 4431.28
perfectly totally get what's going

4425.96 --> 4434.2390000000005
on like how they do things packing order

4431.28 --> 4436.84
like like your own kind versus other

4434.239 --> 4439.799999999999
kind all that that's very very

4436.84 --> 4442.360000000001
straightforward very predictable even

4439.8 --> 4444.679
but some of the just human interactions

4442.36 --> 4444.679
it's

4445.0 --> 4452.32
like and then also that they just that

4449.0 --> 4455.4
they're that they aren't alienated about

4452.32 --> 4459.5199999999995
it that they're like

4455.4 --> 4459.5199999999995
yeah like it was all Norm

4459.6 --> 4470.0
like what what the [ __ ] is this

4465.08 --> 4474.44
I'm sorry I think I I spend enough time

4470.0 --> 4478.159
on on this people out there can be

4474.44 --> 4479.5599999999995
really weird now and maybe it's

4478.159 --> 4483.599999999999
partially just

4479.56 --> 4483.6
media and social

4484.04 --> 4489.199
media

4486.0 --> 4493.44
because when I dig back through my

4489.199 --> 4496.0
memories this really unexplicable form

4493.44 --> 4498.44
of social interaction has really started

4496.0 --> 4501.88
up post

4498.44 --> 4505.5199999999995
internet it really started to get in my

4501.88 --> 4508.12
face after the 9s in the

4505.52 --> 4509.56
2000s that's when it started to like pop

4508.12 --> 4512.599999999999
up that like

4509.56 --> 4515.639
weird alienating type behavior that

4512.6 --> 4518.08
would be seen as normal among themselves

4515.639 --> 4521.0
that started after

4518.08 --> 4523.719
2000 before that it didn't happen there

4521.0 --> 4526.199
was always like this strict code

4523.719 --> 4529.0
and it's like people would say like

4526.199 --> 4531.599999999999
you're acting weird they would say it

4529.0 --> 4534.56
they don't do that anymore

4531.6 --> 4536.6
now it's like nobody says that anymore

4534.56 --> 4538.6
now it's like everybody's adapted to

4536.6 --> 4541.0
being [ __ ]

4538.6 --> 4543.719
insane and that's the new standard or

4541.0 --> 4546.92
something maybe that is just what it is

4543.719 --> 4550.679
it's like I'm still adapted to the old

4546.92 --> 4555.32
chivalry of the 20th century and I just

4550.679 --> 4557.88
don't understand this this new thing I

4555.32 --> 4557.88
just don't get

4565.6 --> 4571.56
it got to go

4567.76 --> 4574.1990000000005
physio multiple surgeries okay yeah good

4571.56 --> 4574.1990000000005
luck idot

4582.12 --> 4585.12
sick

4587.719 --> 4593.96
yeah and also with your physio right you

4591.36 --> 4596.679
might if if you're not like if you don't

4593.96 --> 4600.0
have bad reactions to it I'd like get

4596.679 --> 4602.719
some uh turmeric

4600.0 --> 4605.08
extract because that helps both with

4602.719 --> 4609.52
flexibility and Joint

4605.08 --> 4612.08
recovery and it may yeah like progress

4609.52 --> 4614.679
even the healing from the

4612.08 --> 4616.88
surgery

4614.679 --> 4620.52
I take it that that probably like your

4616.88 --> 4623.84
back or something so

4620.52 --> 4626.76
yeah see if you can supplement with some

4623.84 --> 4630.04
uh turmeric if you weren't already doing

4626.76 --> 4632.679
that by the way just that's my advice

4630.04 --> 4632.679
but yeah good

4642.0 --> 4645.639
luck

4643.6 --> 4646.52
you feel failure doesn't not stop me

4645.639 --> 4651.4400000000005
from

4646.52 --> 4653.84
tying yeah I have that issue too

4651.44 --> 4655.919999999999
failure but that's the funny thing you

4653.84 --> 4658.32
know you can bypass that trick did you

4655.92 --> 4661.1990000000005
know that drunken bullet but you got to

4658.32 --> 4665.199
be very conscious of

4661.199 --> 4668.199
it right because I fear failure I have

4665.199 --> 4671.12
to and that fear has actually especially

4668.199 --> 4674.239
during my teens stopped me from doing a

4671.12 --> 4677.0
whole bunch of things that I didn't do

4674.239 --> 4680.44
that I technically regret of not trying

4677.0 --> 4682.36
it out why because I feared doing it

4680.44 --> 4686.36
wrong and then being embarrassed about

4682.36 --> 4687.599999999999
it but now I have a different approach

4686.36 --> 4693.12
and that

4687.6 --> 4697.96
is I don't see doing things wrong as

4693.12 --> 4701.76
failure I I see doing things wrong as a

4697.96 --> 4703.88
natural side effect that is essential to

4701.76 --> 4705.4400000000005
the progression of your understanding

4703.88 --> 4707.92
and Mastery of

4705.44 --> 4710.12
something so if you start out and you do

4707.92 --> 4714.28
it wrong that's not

4710.12 --> 4718.44
embarrassing that's natural it's like is

4714.28 --> 4721.08
it embarrassing for an AI algorithm to

4718.44 --> 4723.0
like have like a little remember that

4721.08 --> 4725.199
video I think it's pretty famous now

4723.0 --> 4727.8
like a little simulated robot that's

4725.199 --> 4729.599999999999
just through AI learning how to walk and

4727.8 --> 4732.6
it's constantly falling off the screen

4729.6 --> 4735.52
and [ __ ] right is that embarrassing for

4732.6 --> 4738.4400000000005
the little robot that he's so stumbling

4735.52 --> 4742.0
and falling off the screen or is it

4738.44 --> 4744.239
essential and eventually he he succeeds

4742.0 --> 4745.92
all over the place right is it still

4744.239 --> 4748.36
embarrassing that he was stumbling all

4745.92 --> 4750.88
the way it might look silly but it's

4748.36 --> 4752.599999999999
technically not embarrassing when you

4750.88 --> 4755.36
look at the

4752.6 --> 4760.320000000001
whole you look at the whole thing from

4755.36 --> 4763.36
beginning to end and a clumsy start is

4760.32 --> 4765.199
probably like a clumsy start of a

4763.36 --> 4769.04
learning

4765.199 --> 4771.28
process means that the growth curve is

4769.04 --> 4773.84
going to be very

4771.28 --> 4777.28
impressive cu the more clumsy you start

4773.84 --> 4778.8
out with the more it will contrast with

4777.28 --> 4781.84
the eventual end

4778.8 --> 4784.56
resolve that's the best perspective to

4781.84 --> 4785.96
have when you start something it's like

4784.56 --> 4788.719
oh I'm [ __ ] it

4785.96 --> 4790.639
up well that's not failure that just

4788.719 --> 4793.08
means that the growth curve is going to

4790.639 --> 4796.8
be the most impressive compared to when

4793.08 --> 4796.8
you wouldn't start out

4798.0 --> 4804.76
failing right so it's a matter of

4800.48 --> 4807.799999999999
perspective really right and then then

4804.76 --> 4809.4400000000005
you got got another thing you see from

4807.8 --> 4813.1990000000005
that

4809.44 --> 4816.32
perspective giving up is the only real

4813.199 --> 4819.638999999999
failure so if you're embarrassed because

4816.32 --> 4823.719
you thought you looked like an ass for

4819.639 --> 4827.4400000000005
being clumsy at the beginning that's not

4823.719 --> 4830.8
failure but if you let that

4827.44 --> 4833.36
embarrassment drive you to move away to

4830.8 --> 4836.0
hide and thus

4833.36 --> 4841.04
discontinue because of the embarrassment

4836.0 --> 4841.04
then you failed because of the

4841.84 --> 4845.679
embarrassment ironic isn't

4846.199 --> 4854.719
it and I failed a lot because of

4849.8 --> 4854.719
embarrassment it was very painful

4855.8 --> 4862.0
also it's not going to happen anymore

4858.32 --> 4862.0
yeah I've sat through enough of that

4862.08 --> 4867.12
torture of not doing things because I

4864.8 --> 4867.12
felt

4869.88 --> 4875.6
embarrassed better to ask stupid

4872.04 --> 4875.6
questions than to make stupid

4878.239 --> 4883.959999999999
decisions yeah I'd say it like yeah to

4880.719 --> 4886.4800000000005
make stupid mistakes sure but yeah

4883.96 --> 4888.96
that's I'd formulate that specific

4886.48 --> 4893.44
sentence as it's better to ask stupid

4888.96 --> 4893.44
questions than to make stupid

4893.56 --> 4900.04
decisions right because it because that

4897.0 --> 4903.159
of the logic of it because a stupid

4900.04 --> 4905.239
question might not seem stupid until

4903.159 --> 4906.759999999999
somebody that understands it is

4905.239 --> 4909.239
confronted with it and then they can

4906.76 --> 4911.56
tell you it's stupid well if you hadn't

4909.239 --> 4914.199
asked them you didn't know it was stupid

4911.56 --> 4917.52
and then you would have gone on that and

4914.199 --> 4920.04
made a really stupid decision that you

4917.52 --> 4923.360000000001
didn't know was

4920.04 --> 4930.159
stupid so I'd emphasize the decision and

4923.36 --> 4930.159
not the mistake anyway but yeah it's all

4937.159 --> 4941.5599999999995
true all right I hope you guys are all

4939.719 --> 4944.56
enjoying the

4941.56 --> 4944.56
show

4947.92 --> 4951.08
what am I going to call this

4959.03 --> 4960.92
[Applause]

4960.23 --> 4964.009999999999
[Music]

4960.92 --> 4964.01
[Applause]

4971.56 --> 4974.56
thing

4978.49 --> 4981.63
[Applause]

5001.48 --> 5004.48
for

5004.719 --> 5009.36
I got a funny

5007.04 --> 5013.32
title I'm going to call this the Dark

5009.36 --> 5013.32
World instruction manual for

5015.56 --> 5021.0
beginners which has some hidden sarcasm

5018.32 --> 5023.99
in it because obviously the dark world's

5021.0 --> 5027.029
not for freaking beginners you'd be

5023.99 --> 5027.0289999999995
[Music]

5031.48 --> 5034.48
crazy

5061.8 --> 5066.2390000000005
yeah come on virus yes you're very right

5064.56 --> 5069.6
and AO logical

5066.239 --> 5073.879999999999
conclusion yes the funny thing is is

5069.6 --> 5077.4400000000005
that stupid questions can trigger really

5073.88 --> 5080.159000000001
really intelligent insights not directly

5077.44 --> 5083.099999999999
related to the stupid question but like

5080.159 --> 5086.219
as a as a reflection

5083.1 --> 5086.219
[Music]

5086.52 --> 5090.4400000000005
board you could call it a Pinky and the

5089.4 --> 5093.32
Brain

5090.44 --> 5096.159
effect right

5093.32 --> 5098.36
cuz if the brain had just another brain

5096.159 --> 5100.759999999999
they he' just get into gamma fights with

5098.36 --> 5103.36
him all the time competing but pinky is

5100.76 --> 5106.2390000000005
a freaking idiot he's not going to

5103.36 --> 5108.5599999999995
compete he's not a threat but he

5106.239 --> 5111.599999999999
does

5108.56 --> 5115.0
stimulate the brain because he's so

5111.6 --> 5117.52
stupid it's interesting

5115.0 --> 5119.32
interaction I don't know why the

5117.52 --> 5122.56
freaking know I'm taking that so serious

5119.32 --> 5124.639
but there is an effect there it's like

5122.56 --> 5127.2390000000005
people are asking stupid questions when

5124.639 --> 5129.36
they mean well where they're not like oh

5127.239 --> 5131.239
I want it to be stupid when they want to

5129.36 --> 5134.44
get it but it's still stupid it can

5131.239 --> 5137.159
trigger like very intelligent

5134.44 --> 5139.839999999999
insights it's kind of weird how that

5137.159 --> 5143.719
works CU in the end it's more about the

5139.84 --> 5149.159000000001
intention than how cohesive

5143.719 --> 5151.96
or yeah cognitively valid the train of

5149.159 --> 5154.839999999999
thinking rolls out the intention is more

5151.96 --> 5158.199
important like did you mean to clear

5154.84 --> 5160.04
things up or did you mean to stop

5158.199 --> 5163.32
somebody in their tracks that is getting

5160.04 --> 5165.04
too complicated for your comfort it's a

5163.32 --> 5168.88
very different angle of approach that

5165.04 --> 5171.28
will really determine and how you can

5168.88 --> 5174.4800000000005
respond to that

5171.28 --> 5174.48
intuitively it

5176.08 --> 5184.199
matters now I'm going to add that

5178.44 --> 5184.199
intention does matter it really does

5186.02 --> 5193.579000000001
[Applause]

5206.56 --> 5210.0
ah there

5211.199 --> 5214.199
go

5232.4 --> 5236.36
all right yeah move there's all

5234.52 --> 5238.88
different levels of stupid questions

5236.36 --> 5241.759999999999
right somebody can ask a stupid question

5238.88 --> 5243.96
that is stupid because they're not

5241.76 --> 5245.4400000000005
catching on to the main level that

5243.96 --> 5246.679
somebody else is communicating so

5245.44 --> 5249.08
they're asking a question that's

5246.679 --> 5251.04
basically not really all that relevant

5249.08 --> 5254.04
which is a sign that they don't under

5251.04 --> 5256.56
they're not following right that's

5254.04 --> 5257.6
annoying it's different from a dumb

5256.56 --> 5261.119000000001
question as

5257.6 --> 5263.92
in you can follow but you're still

5261.119 --> 5267.239
asking something that

5263.92 --> 5269.32
is a sign that the person's a little bit

5267.239 --> 5270.48
distracted even within their

5269.32 --> 5272.759999999999
understanding of what the other person

5270.48 --> 5276.44
is talking about and he asking asking a

5272.76 --> 5278.119000000001
lesser relevant question right it's a

5276.44 --> 5282.759999999999
different form of

5278.119 --> 5285.5199999999995
stupid somewhere like distracted type of

5282.76 --> 5288.96
stupid instead of like not comprehending

5285.52 --> 5292.56
type of stupid see all different

5288.96 --> 5292.56
levels it's all a

5297.719 --> 5303.8
spectrum and I I just I'm a person that

5300.6 --> 5306.56
take not that takes natural note and

5303.8 --> 5309.159000000001
starts categorizing into systems

5306.56 --> 5311.4400000000005
absolutely everything including this

5309.159 --> 5313.759999999999
like the different types of stupid why

5311.44 --> 5315.0
stupid what is the response and all

5313.76 --> 5317.280000000001
these

5315.0 --> 5320.04
intuitive things that people's like yeah

5317.28 --> 5322.32
of course that's happening like did you

5320.04 --> 5323.84
categorize it did you cat do you act or

5322.32 --> 5325.44
it's like oh no that's happening and it

5323.84 --> 5327.2390000000005
seems natural yeah yeah yeah that's how

5325.44 --> 5328.919999999999
people go about it's like oh that's

5327.239 --> 5330.4
happening it's all natural yeah and they

5328.92 --> 5332.119
don't understand it though it's just

5330.4 --> 5333.32
they let their intuition deal with that

5332.119 --> 5336.48
and they don't think about it

5333.32 --> 5339.44
cognitively I do with everything and so

5336.48 --> 5341.959999999999
I just catalog subconscious interactions

5339.44 --> 5344.159
and social responses and then put it

5341.96 --> 5347.04
into patterns and

5344.159 --> 5351.679
categories this what I

5347.04 --> 5351.679
do and I explain it right here on my

5360.92 --> 5366.159
show

5363.32 --> 5368.36
yeah and some somebody asking a dumb

5366.159 --> 5371.08
question help other person figure it

5368.36 --> 5374.48
where they are lost

5371.08 --> 5377.8
maybe but it will also help to identify

5374.48 --> 5380.5199999999995
what is stupid and what is

5377.8 --> 5383.400000000001
not right if somebody asks a dumb

5380.52 --> 5386.400000000001
question then that immediately sets the

5383.4 --> 5388.839999999999
standard from all that are listening

5386.4 --> 5391.96
within that moment as to what is

5388.84 --> 5394.6
considered stupid and was it what isn't

5391.96 --> 5396.08
that becomes determined by whoever is

5394.6 --> 5399.400000000001
the alpha of the

5396.08 --> 5402.4
energy of that social

5399.4 --> 5404.08
communication it will just be revealed

5402.4 --> 5406.119
without somebody asking a stupid

5404.08 --> 5408.08
question nobody really knows what is

5406.119 --> 5410.5599999999995
stupid and what isn't you

5408.08 --> 5412.32
see not for real you can have your own

5410.56 --> 5414.0
ideas about it but you don't know if

5412.32 --> 5417.159
everybody else thinks the

5414.0 --> 5420.8
same it only really becomes revealed

5417.159 --> 5424.92
once a stupid question has been asked

5420.8 --> 5427.04
and then a standard is

5424.92 --> 5430.04
set by the

5427.04 --> 5430.04
alpha

5442.639 --> 5449.32
naturally stupid is only stupid when

5444.96 --> 5452.119
compared to something smarter no not

5449.32 --> 5454.84
necessarily no stupid is always stupid

5452.119 --> 5459.159
doesn't matter if you compare

5454.84 --> 5460.0
it yeah if something is just stupid it's

5459.159 --> 5462.36
just

5460.0 --> 5464.119
stupid it's not just stupid because

5462.36 --> 5466.4
there is something that is smarter it's

5464.119 --> 5466.4
just

5471.28 --> 5477.28
stupid

5473.92 --> 5480.76
right like banging your head against the

5477.28 --> 5483.04
wall because you have a headache is just

5480.76 --> 5485.84
stupid

5483.04 --> 5488.28
yeah you don't need to compare a better

5485.84 --> 5491.719
solution to how to deal with

5488.28 --> 5493.28
headaches to know that banging your head

5491.719 --> 5495.88
against the wall because you have a

5493.28 --> 5498.36
headache is

5495.88 --> 5503.679
stupid I

5498.36 --> 5503.679
mean can I get a confirmation there Kuma

5510.76 --> 5513.76
virus

5515.159 --> 5519.839999999999
by the way who the hell would bang their

5516.48 --> 5523.08
head against the wall when they had a

5519.84 --> 5525.8
headache well somebody that just doesn't

5523.08 --> 5527.4
is really at an extremely low

5525.8 --> 5529.84
Consciousness level because if you have

5527.4 --> 5531.48
any memory you know that when you

5529.84 --> 5533.119000000001
actually have a headache last thing you

5531.48 --> 5536.599999999999
want to do is bump your head against the

5533.119 --> 5539.199
wall but hey that's why it's really

5536.6 --> 5541.280000000001
stupid and it's like independently

5539.199 --> 5543.638999999999
stupid you don't need to have any other

5541.28 --> 5546.679
compar person to intuitively and

5543.639 --> 5549.28
instinctually know that that is stupid

5546.679 --> 5552.639
you can immediately sympathize resonate

5549.28 --> 5556.44
like oh what if I had a headache

5552.639 --> 5558.719
Bo yeah you don't need to compare it to

5556.44 --> 5561.5199999999995
know that it's

5558.719 --> 5565.76
stupid you just have to simulate it for

5561.52 --> 5565.76
a very short moment to know that is

5566.32 --> 5569.799999999999
stupid am I

5570.639 --> 5575.6
right putting leeches on your body was a

5573.8 --> 5580.04
smart thing to do once now it's stupid

5575.6 --> 5582.08
no it isn't and it's still medicinal

5580.04 --> 5585.199
treatment

5582.08 --> 5587.32
leeches snake oil salesman yeah yeah

5585.199 --> 5591.199
snake oil still works and leeches work

5587.32 --> 5593.92
still yeah scientifically proven did you

5591.199 --> 5598.04
know did you know that

5593.92 --> 5602.4800000000005
leeches that leeches inject a substance

5598.04 --> 5606.08
that's like a very pure form of aspirin

5602.48 --> 5609.44
which is a blood thinner right also has

5606.08 --> 5612.04
other influences like it will decrease

5609.44 --> 5614.719
headaches apparently which is known

5612.04 --> 5617.84
about aspirin yeah yeah yeah so leeches

5614.719 --> 5617.84
are nature's

5618.679 --> 5625.8
aspirin yeah it's not

5622.28 --> 5627.239
stupid it's still being used as

5625.8 --> 5630.56
medicinal

5627.239 --> 5633.159
treatment this

5630.56 --> 5636.1990000000005
day

5633.159 --> 5636.199
yeah because it

5637.76 --> 5645.320000000001
works now it doesn't mean that it is the

5640.679 --> 5648.1990000000005
solution to anything right but it is

5645.32 --> 5649.639
still being used and it does work just

5648.199 --> 5654.199
like snake

5649.639 --> 5656.36
oil could still be used and it does work

5654.199 --> 5658.5599999999995
it just doesn't work for absolutely

5656.36 --> 5661.28
everything right that's where the scam

5658.56 --> 5663.4800000000005
comes in saying like all this one thing

5661.28 --> 5667.28
is secure for all things yeah [ __ ] you

5663.48 --> 5671.159
that's not true but they do help for

5667.28 --> 5674.159
some things and that's just

5671.159 --> 5674.159
true

5677.119 --> 5684.08
right Jesus kumu

5680.36 --> 5684.08
virus that's [ __ ]

5685.4 --> 5690.199
up banging the head at the wall is

5690.48 --> 5696.759999999999
comforting yeah wellum maybe that little

5694.08 --> 5699.48
boy is just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

5696.76 --> 5701.360000000001
then and if he isn't or he wasn't then

5699.48 --> 5702.959999999999
he would have been I mean if you're

5701.36 --> 5705.44
comfortable banging your head against

5702.96 --> 5708.0
the wall it's not going to lead to good

5705.44 --> 5708.0
things let

5709.44 --> 5717.96
me he's fine today I'm sure he's

5714.6 --> 5717.96
fine all

5720.4 --> 5725.239
right

5723.28 --> 5729.639
I mean the funny thing is if you don't

5725.239 --> 5733.08
have a headache then you can like tap

5729.639 --> 5734.84
likeo like a certain level of shock

5733.08 --> 5736.88
that's not like bang hard but just a

5734.84 --> 5740.1990000000005
little yeah you know it can actually be

5736.88 --> 5743.0
a sort of form of a vibration

5740.199 --> 5746.239
therapy and it doesn't work when you do

5743.0 --> 5747.96
it against like solid rock or steel

5746.239 --> 5750.159
because then the resonation doesn't work

5747.96 --> 5752.8
you just get mostly the impact on your

5750.159 --> 5755.4
skull which can be

5752.8 --> 5758.1990000000005
painful but if it's something that

5755.4 --> 5759.719
vibrates a bit more like

5758.199 --> 5762.32
wood

5759.719 --> 5765.639
then you can actually build up a

5762.32 --> 5765.639
vibration that can be

5765.76 --> 5769.04
therapeutical but that's not going to

5767.52 --> 5771.320000000001
work when you have a

5769.04 --> 5775.719
headache it's rather to like bring

5771.32 --> 5775.719
yourself in a trans just

5780.32 --> 5787.719
like

5782.48 --> 5790.718999999999
um right that effect it is yeah it can

5787.719 --> 5794.44
be

5790.719 --> 5796.88
hypnotizing but it's not going to like

5794.44 --> 5796.879999999999
cure a

5797.4 --> 5801.96
headache blood

5799.8 --> 5804.360000000001
leting yeah blood leting is pretty

5801.96 --> 5804.36
[ __ ]

5810.28 --> 5814.96
stupid

5812.76 --> 5817.76
right and but yeah blood leting never

5814.96 --> 5817.76
really worked

5819.84 --> 5826.159000000001
though I mean it's mostly uh what do you

5822.679 --> 5829.08
call that Placebo blood let most of

5826.159 --> 5831.839999999999
blood leting was just Placebo it's like

5829.08 --> 5835.48
oh yeah I feel that pressure because I'm

5831.84 --> 5837.4800000000005
all riled up right I'm and then like

5835.48 --> 5840.08
yeah you tap some of that

5837.48 --> 5842.04
and yeah less blood pressure you feel

5840.08 --> 5846.76
like slower again and then you are like

5842.04 --> 5849.0
forced to calm down well yeah that's

5846.76 --> 5850.8
called a placebo it's just oh I'm OV

5849.0 --> 5855.4
excited oh you need to let some of that

5850.8 --> 5858.8
blood out oh I'm tired again right and

5855.4 --> 5862.36
any other I mean

5858.8 --> 5864.4400000000005
sure Western doctors would sort of do it

5862.36 --> 5867.159
in medieval

5864.44 --> 5870.48
times I think it was I personally think

5867.159 --> 5872.719
it falls under Al allopathy early

5870.48 --> 5874.48
nonsense

5872.719 --> 5877.44
I really

5874.48 --> 5879.638999999999
do I don't think blood leting was like

5877.44 --> 5882.04
something that herb doctors were doing

5879.639 --> 5884.599
or witches I don't think they were doing

5882.04 --> 5891.239
that at all I really think it was

5884.599 --> 5891.2390000000005
rather the Proto doctors that were doing

5891.719 --> 5897.4
that I don't think

5894.239 --> 5898.5199999999995
like shamanic healing involves blood

5897.4 --> 5901.92
leing

5898.52 --> 5905.360000000001
ever right and that's one of the oldest

5901.92 --> 5905.36
like professions in the world

5905.48 --> 5913.759999999999
arguably so I don't think blood leting

5909.0 --> 5916.92
was like I think there was an

5913.76 --> 5920.4400000000005
early an early appearance of like the

5916.92 --> 5923.56
allopathic medic medicine that we're now

5920.44 --> 5926.28
Dr yeah drowning in in the Western World

5923.56 --> 5929.280000000001
I think that that is where it comes from

5926.28 --> 5932.759999999999
it wasn't a universal

5929.28 --> 5934.8
practice it was a weird doctor thing

5932.76 --> 5937.76
when they were like from the foundations

5934.8 --> 5940.320000000001
of alchemy trying to figure out a me the

5937.76 --> 5943.320000000001
mechanical function of the body and

5940.32 --> 5943.32
failing at it

5943.52 --> 5948.719
utterly and only learning a lot out of

5946.88 --> 5951.8
all their failures which is what

5948.719 --> 5955.56
allopathic medicine is it's all fuckups

5951.8 --> 5959.119000000001
and just oh when somebody is completely

5955.56 --> 5961.8
[ __ ] up well we know how to deal with

5959.119 --> 5963.96
every stage of how somebody can [ __ ] up

5961.8 --> 5967.1990000000005
their body that's what allopathic

5963.96 --> 5969.2390000000005
medicine is they know everything about

5967.199 --> 5972.119
how your body can get destroyed what

5969.239 --> 5975.959999999999
happens every step of the

5972.119 --> 5979.199
way right because it's all based on

5975.96 --> 5982.119
[ __ ] up bodies and then like oh what

5979.199 --> 5984.04
can you do to try to fix it that's all

5982.119 --> 5985.88
it ever was and I think that blood

5984.04 --> 5988.44
leting was like one of the

5985.88 --> 5991.599
earliest

5988.44 --> 5993.96
experiments that they were doing with

5991.599 --> 5995.92
allopathic medicine like before it

5993.96 --> 5998.32
became really standardized in the 20th

5995.92 --> 6000.4400000000005
century by the Rockefeller foundation

5998.32 --> 6004.119
and the blood leing itself wasn't part

6000.44 --> 6007.199
of it anymore right so it's like the

6004.119 --> 6009.28
blood leing in my opinion and it would

6007.199 --> 6012.04
be interesting to see people like doing

6009.28 --> 6014.32
actual Historical Research into this but

6012.04 --> 6017.639
I have a suspicion and so I'm going to

6014.32 --> 6021.04
call it my opinion that blood leing is

6017.639 --> 6024.679
like a one of the child diseases of

6021.04 --> 6027.48
allopathic medicines it's like before it

6024.679 --> 6030.28
became adult in the 20th century with

6027.48 --> 6033.44
the Rockefeller Foundation that was that

6030.28 --> 6037.0
blood liting [ __ ] was still part of it

6033.44 --> 6038.919999999999
in its child phas yeah that's what I

6037.0 --> 6042.8
think about blood

6038.92 --> 6045.4
liing and hey if you find like direct

6042.8 --> 6047.639
proof that I'm wrong in some historical

6045.4 --> 6050.32
research I'd love to hear about it

6047.639 --> 6052.28
please leave a comment with details that

6050.32 --> 6054.639
would be great if if I'm wrong at this

6052.28 --> 6057.5199999999995
I'd love to hear about

6054.639 --> 6060.719
it and if I turn out to be completely

6057.52 --> 6062.119000000001
correct I'd also love to hear about this

6060.719 --> 6066.719
so let me

6062.119 --> 6066.719
know in the chat or in the comment

6068.44 --> 6074.919999999999
section out with bad blood yeah it's

6070.88 --> 6074.92
[ __ ] there's no out with bad

6075.28 --> 6082.239
blood it's all har [ __ ] yeah all that

6079.719 --> 6084.2390000000005
out of the bad you know there's an organ

6082.239 --> 6085.4
in your body that just does that it's

6084.239 --> 6088.839999999999
called the

6085.4 --> 6091.5199999999995
kidney so blood leting is

6088.84 --> 6093.56
literally not understanding that it is

6091.52 --> 6096.040000000001
your kidney that is doing that the

6093.56 --> 6099.1990000000005
dumbest thing you

6096.04 --> 6103.0
ever yeah it never

6099.199 --> 6106.839999999999
worked like the only reason you could

6103.0 --> 6108.76
even imagine how blood fling in any form

6106.84 --> 6111.52
could have some kind of perceived

6108.76 --> 6113.719
benefit is if you had such bad kidney

6111.52 --> 6116.360000000001
issues that they're basically not

6113.719 --> 6119.96
functioning and then blood leting might

6116.36 --> 6122.4
literally relieve you of acute tox toxic

6119.96 --> 6124.08
poisoning or something but I mean if

6122.4 --> 6126.5599999999995
your kidneys are that bad you're not

6124.08 --> 6128.4
going to survive anyhow not for long

6126.56 --> 6131.96
especially in medieval

6128.4 --> 6136.239
times right so it's all just bull it's

6131.96 --> 6136.2390000000005
all Folly blood blooding is [ __ ]

6137.4 --> 6144.119
[ __ ] and I bet you too that this is

6141.159 --> 6147.719
not even a joke that blood leting was

6144.119 --> 6151.159
probably one of the early tricks for

6147.719 --> 6155.08
vampires to get cheap

6151.159 --> 6155.08
blood I'm not even

6156.0 --> 6159.119
joking I

6159.36 --> 6165.679
mean right everything else that's coming

6162.88 --> 6169.96
from the medical allopathic system it's

6165.679 --> 6172.32
all vampiric so doesn't it just seem

6169.96 --> 6176.0
logical like blood leing yeah that's

6172.32 --> 6178.599
just a a way that doctors can convince

6176.0 --> 6181.96
their patients to to give them some of

6178.599 --> 6184.0
their blood to get the bad spirits out

6181.96 --> 6185.32
or the poison out or however whatever

6184.0 --> 6186.48
they're going like yeah just give me

6185.32 --> 6189.199
some of that

6186.48 --> 6194.119
blood yeah very

6189.199 --> 6194.119
valuable for my main

6194.159 --> 6197.638999999999
sponsor am I

6199.679 --> 6204.96
right

6202.32 --> 6208.759999999999
right no questions asked because the

6204.96 --> 6211.8
doctor said it right oh yeah no you're

6208.76 --> 6214.4400000000005
young son yeah he's just having a fever

6211.8 --> 6217.88
we just need some of his

6214.44 --> 6221.879999999999
blood right cuz if they' say like yeah

6217.88 --> 6224.119
the count needs a pint again then well

6221.88 --> 6225.92
maybe the Christian parents are going to

6224.119 --> 6229.36
be like what the hell we're not giving

6225.92 --> 6233.639
our sons blood to that devil right but

6229.36 --> 6236.32
if the doctor says well for medical

6233.639 --> 6238.96
reasons we have determined that we needs

6236.32 --> 6243.119
to lose some of that blood then they'll

6238.96 --> 6245.0
be oh oh God if if the if science if the

6243.119 --> 6248.799999999999
medical doctor says

6245.0 --> 6251.639
it well then it's okay do I think

6248.8 --> 6255.52
vampires are real I think that vampirism

6251.639 --> 6258.719
is very real and that blood has been

6255.52 --> 6262.599
used by wealthy

6258.719 --> 6262.599
people for millennia

6269.44 --> 6277.638999999999
to like prolong their life and to combat

6273.44 --> 6277.638999999999
chronic diseases yes

6278.639 --> 6284.0
blood child's blood to be more specific

6281.76 --> 6288.04
because that's actually

6284.0 --> 6290.84
works and now they can refine it and put

6288.04 --> 6292.56
it for a few fruit filters and all back

6290.84 --> 6297.56
in the day they just take the blood and

6292.56 --> 6297.56
just like no just do it right in there

6298.04 --> 6304.96
right drinking no not drinking blood

6301.52 --> 6309.159000000001
pumping blood in your

6304.96 --> 6312.159
veins super early transfusion it's just

6309.159 --> 6316.199
take blood and you just pump it right in

6312.159 --> 6318.4
there not drinking drinking doesn't work

6316.199 --> 6322.32
it'll literally break the blood because

6318.4 --> 6326.0
of the stomach acid and like your body

6322.32 --> 6328.36
your digestive system is not is not like

6326.0 --> 6330.36
suited to do that you'll literally throw

6328.36 --> 6334.92
it up again and you can get very sick

6330.36 --> 6339.36
from that yeah so they wouldn't drink

6334.92 --> 6341.1990000000005
it like in oldfashioned movies they just

6339.36 --> 6344.799999999999
transfuse

6341.199 --> 6347.799999999999
it yeah they just put it in a bowl with

6344.8 --> 6349.84
a little tube with a needle in your arm

6347.8 --> 6353.400000000001
yeah they could do that in medieval

6349.84 --> 6353.400000000001
times it was wasn't that

6357.56 --> 6364.4800000000005
complicated and I think it's even

6360.48 --> 6366.959999999999
official I'm not entirely sure that

6364.48 --> 6369.4
Leonardo da Vinci actually did blood

6366.96 --> 6373.44
transfusion in medieval

6369.4 --> 6375.44
times that he did that one time don't

6373.44 --> 6379.4
know if it's just a popular rumor or

6375.44 --> 6382.44
anything but I mean

6379.4 --> 6384.08
yeah the thing is that if you don't know

6382.44 --> 6387.199
anything about anything then it just

6384.08 --> 6388.5199999999995
seems really crazy to do that but if

6387.199 --> 6390.879999999999
you're

6388.52 --> 6395.96
confident and you're crazy enough to try

6390.88 --> 6397.8
it out well yeah it could be done even

6395.96 --> 6399.719
in medieval times with the materials

6397.8 --> 6400.96
available then could definitely have

6399.719 --> 6404.639
been

6400.96 --> 6406.88
done right you don't necessarily need

6404.639 --> 6409.400000000001
plastic to be able to do such

6406.88 --> 6413.159000000001
things but it's going to be more risky

6409.4 --> 6413.159
though right but it's still

6422.119 --> 6429.28
doable they say V imp was yeah sure he

6426.08 --> 6433.92
was now Vlad the Impaler was just a

6429.28 --> 6433.92
fanatical nationalist that's what he

6439.32 --> 6445.4
was

6441.96 --> 6447.76
I feel a lot of weird sympathy with the

6445.4 --> 6451.28
idea of flat the Impaler like

6447.76 --> 6454.88
that like the viciousness it I have a

6451.28 --> 6456.719
bit of that like even when I early dived

6454.88 --> 6459.159000000001
into the gothic scene it was like yeah

6456.719 --> 6460.199
flat the Impaler man like that's that's

6459.159 --> 6464.799999999999
what you

6460.199 --> 6467.759999999999
do like yeah deter it you get super

6464.8 --> 6470.320000000001
super vicious like so monstrously

6467.76 --> 6473.719
vicious that like nobody's going to try

6470.32 --> 6477.679
try anything nobody's

6473.719 --> 6480.04
going no no no no you just like Splat

6477.679 --> 6482.84
horror that you're never going to forget

6480.04 --> 6485.719
yeah yeah and then yeah yeah what are

6482.84 --> 6490.2390000000005
you going to do now oh you going to try

6485.719 --> 6493.199
it you want this spear up your ass

6490.239 --> 6496.638999999999
too why don't you try

6493.199 --> 6496.638999999999
it so

6499.239 --> 6502.239
yeah

6503.159 --> 6509.36
but uh I yeah vampire I don't know I

6506.84 --> 6514.52
think he was probably a raw meat guy and

6509.36 --> 6516.96
he might have also had cannibalistic

6514.52 --> 6519.119000000001
tendencies that he would like eat the

6516.96 --> 6521.8
brains of his enemies and [ __ ] so he

6519.119 --> 6525.08
probably was doing like dark freaky

6521.8 --> 6528.679
necromancy magic and [ __ ] akumar he was

6525.08 --> 6531.96
not a nice

6528.679 --> 6533.719
person and he was was consumed by evil

6531.96 --> 6534.92
nightmares and that kind of things as

6533.719 --> 6537.199
far as I

6534.92 --> 6539.96
know but

6537.199 --> 6544.0
uh

6539.96 --> 6548.88
yeah not a vampire as in oh I need to

6544.0 --> 6548.88
drink blood or I will die not like

6558.76 --> 6562.4400000000005
that I canot an

6563.679 --> 6569.719
anemic cuz there would have also been

6566.88 --> 6572.1990000000005
people that were like severely

6569.719 --> 6574.199
anemic that didn't know what to do about

6572.199 --> 6576.04
it cuz they didn't have like iron

6574.199 --> 6579.28
supplements back

6576.04 --> 6582.28
then and that they actually ended up

6579.28 --> 6585.32
drinking blood usually of animals just

6582.28 --> 6586.84
to get that that

6585.32 --> 6589.119
iron

6586.84 --> 6591.76
right did you know

6589.119 --> 6595.32
that

6591.76 --> 6597.400000000001
that anemia like can lead to vampire

6595.32 --> 6598.92
like Behavior because if you don't get

6597.4 --> 6601.159
proper medicine for

6598.92 --> 6603.599
it it's

6601.159 --> 6607.598999999999
weird and people that would have those

6603.599 --> 6610.679
issues would and then get caught like

6607.599 --> 6612.32
like sucking a goat like bleeding a goat

6610.679 --> 6614.8
and then drinking it or something like

6612.32 --> 6617.36
that would be like oh what the [ __ ] is

6614.8 --> 6618.88
that a vampire like is always so pale

6617.36 --> 6621.159
and everything it's like yes because

6618.88 --> 6622.88
they have anemia and just trying to

6621.159 --> 6625.159
desperately get that iron and if they

6622.88 --> 6628.84
don't get it then they'll just start to

6625.159 --> 6630.759999999999
faint and die or they'll have instincts

6628.84 --> 6635.2390000000005
that will make them survive that will

6630.76 --> 6639.0
literally like make them hungry for

6635.239 --> 6639.0
blood it's because of the

6641.04 --> 6646.32
anemia lack of iron no it's not just

6643.599 --> 6648.2390000000005
lack of anemia is a chronic condition

6646.32 --> 6651.639
it's

6648.239 --> 6655.28
hereditary and it will make you have a

6651.639 --> 6659.079
lack of iron that you can't really

6655.28 --> 6661.84
normally replenish easily that's kind of

6659.079 --> 6664.5599999999995
the problem I think maybe I got it

6661.84 --> 6668.360000000001
slightly wrong but I knew a girl over

6664.56 --> 6668.360000000001
the Internet once that was severely

6669.119 --> 6675.598999999999
anemic and she yeah it was like a gothic

6673.28 --> 6679.119
girl very

6675.599 --> 6682.28
nice but very anemic and she like she's

6679.119 --> 6686.079
like yeah it's I like I can't risk

6682.28 --> 6686.079
getting wounded because that can get me

6686.36 --> 6691.598999999999
killed Spirit com no no it's nothing

6690.159 --> 6695.199
like that at

6691.599 --> 6698.4400000000005
all Spirit cooking is [ __ ] lar

6695.199 --> 6701.96
horeshit Spirit cooking is shock magic

6698.44 --> 6706.799999999999
is Spirit shock magic like

6701.96 --> 6710.079
Bo yeah is scaring the [ __ ] out of you

6706.8 --> 6712.0
making it seem spook is and nightmarish

6710.079 --> 6714.719
it's a completely different type of

6712.0 --> 6717.679
thing Spirit cooking actually has

6714.719 --> 6720.88
nothing to do with

6717.679 --> 6723.4
anything biological related it's all

6720.88 --> 6726.1990000000005
that's why it's called Spirit cooking

6723.4 --> 6730.199
and not blood

6726.199 --> 6732.598999999999
cooking or like body cooking no it's

6730.199 --> 6734.879999999999
Spirit cooking because it's about

6732.599 --> 6738.159000000001
screwing with your

6734.88 --> 6740.52
spirit creating hell around you like

6738.159 --> 6742.44
you're a demon in hell it's for the

6740.52 --> 6744.159000000001
spirit it's the trick the spirit it's

6742.44 --> 6746.5199999999995
not for the

6744.159 --> 6751.839999999999
body like they don't

6746.52 --> 6755.88
actually eat like living [ __ ] or

6751.84 --> 6761.1990000000005
blood it's all AAR it's just to make you

6755.88 --> 6761.1990000000005
feel like it's real to fool a

6764.599 --> 6769.56

6769.56 --> 6775.4800000000005

6772.4 --> 6778.879999999999
and that can't handle Sun a lot of

6775.48 --> 6780.5599999999995
Gingers like really don't handle Sun

6778.88 --> 6785.400000000001
like they can't get in there or they'll

6780.56 --> 6788.679

6785.4 --> 6790.179999999999
time right so there's plenty of people

6788.679 --> 6793.299
